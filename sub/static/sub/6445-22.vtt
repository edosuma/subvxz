WEBVTT

01:20.831 --> 01:22.537
No.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.538
No, Papa. No.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.093
No.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.636
No, Papa.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.315
No. Papa, no.

01:50.486 --> 01:51.521
No. No.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.686
No. No.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.192
Papa, no.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.417
We got him.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.968
No bullets.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.973
It’s inside him. We need the man alive.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.673
The entity can’t survive
out of a human body.

03:42.848 --> 03:47.467
I want you to check the eyes of every man,
woman and child until you ﬁnd it.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.347
Lex.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.443
You look worried, son.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.818
-ls everything okay?
-You tell me, Dad.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.690
Since I put on this wedding ring...

04:03.869 --> 04:06.030
...you have a knack
for being one step ahead of me.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.661
I don’t have time for this.
I have things to do.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.164
Like have a private screening
of that DVD?

04:11.877 --> 04:15.244
You know, the documentary. The one
Lana stole from me and gave to you.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.003
Oh, dear.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.756
I’d hoped married life
had lessened your paranoia.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.634
I have security footage of Lana
in this library...

04:22.804 --> 04:25.181
...forcing open my briefcase
and pocketing a DVD.

04:25.349 --> 04:29.558
Lana would never, ever do something
like that unless she was being coerced.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.688
As hard as it is for you to believe,
Lana actually loves me.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.186
Oh, you know so little about women,
Lex.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.824
I suppose losing your mother
at such an early age didn’t help matters.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.575
Lana does not love you.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.035
The only reason
she agreed to marry you...

04:53.210 --> 04:57.203
...was that I gave her
a gentle, yet very ﬁrm, nudge.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.423
Using my wife against me?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.713
That’s deplorable, even for you.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.683
Whatever debt you think
I still owe you...

05:11.853 --> 05:13.104
. . .we are even.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.890
I want you out of my life.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.104
I don’t think you’re gonna
get rid of me that easily.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.577
The car’s ready.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.579
You know, I was thinking...

05:38.255 --> 05:41.418
...if you’re half the senator
that you are a mom...

05:41.591 --> 05:43.923
...this country’s in really good hands.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.338
| always thought you’d be the one
to leave the farm ﬁrst.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.684
Washington, 0.0. is no different
than Topeka.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.974
It’s only a few seconds more
away for me.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.140
That’s not what I mean.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.903
I know this has been
a really difﬁcult year for you...

06:05.115 --> 06:07.606
...especially since Lana and Lex
got married.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.241
Like you always tell me,
some things are just meant to be.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.497
Clark...

06:15.667 --> 06:19.956
...if you feel it would be better
to have some distance from them...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.953
...by moving away from Smallville...

06:22.132 --> 06:25.124
...I don’t want you to let this farm
keep you from doing that.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.635
This farm, it’s my home.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.297
It’s been in our family for over 100 years.
Someone has to take care of it.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.309
But that someone
doesn’t have to be you.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.851
Just because I’m leaving
doesn’t mean you have to stay.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.902
Excuse me. Senator, it’s time to go.

06:46.448 --> 06:50.191
-Your plane to Washington is waiting.
-l’ll be right there.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.366
I love you.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.993
I love you too, Mom.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.370
Hey.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.336
Is that the look of a reporter
on the trail of a hot story...

07:48.510 --> 07:51.673
...or someone trying to pick
good lottery numbers?

07:51.847 --> 07:53.178
Right before Wes haywired...

07:53.348 --> 07:56.556
...he kept repeating these numbers
over and over again.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.262
They have to mean something.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.724
Well, Wes was a soldier.
I mean, maybe it was his serial number.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.356
Not in any branch of the armed forces
I’ve ever heard of.

08:05.527 --> 08:09.315
I’ve run the numbers through every search
engine on the web. I got diddly-squat.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.275
Good, let’s keep it that way.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.782
Lois, take it from someone who’s
gone up against the Lex Luthor army...

08:14.953 --> 08:18.070
...more than once. Not only will victory
remain elusive...

08:18.248 --> 08:21.081
...but you’re certain to step on a landmine
in the process.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.826
I’m the general’s daughter, remember?
| live for battle.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.088
Not the kind of battles you can’t win,
Lois.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.590
You remember
what he did to my mother?

08:30.760 --> 08:34.093
I don’t want him to hurt someone else
that I care about. Now, please...

08:34.264 --> 08:35.845
...back off.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.092
You know what?
You’re right.

08:40.604 --> 08:44.267
Why would I knowingly walk straight
into enemy ﬁre?

08:46.818 --> 08:49.275
He’ll get his. It’s only a matter of time.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.186
Good.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.778
You can thank me later.
I gotta rocket to the Planet.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.225
Longitude and latitude.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.303
No duh.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.821
He’s a mail carrier from a nearby village.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.108
We found his body the day
after the incident.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.571
Did his blood get us anywhere?

09:39.746 --> 09:43.489
No abnormalities,
deﬁnitely no alien peptide sequences.

09:43.667 --> 09:47.080
Whatever that creature was on the DVD,
it’s not inside this guy anymore.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.666
Wes Keenan was a subpar prototype...

09:49.839 --> 09:52.581
...because the peptides we used
came from a dead specimen.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.715
We need the entity to be in a living host.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.504
We’re trying. But we’ve discovered this
thing lasts in a human for 24 hours...

09:58.682 --> 10:01.674
-...before it needs to ﬁnd a victim.
-Better set your stopwatch.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.810
That alien DNA is the only way
to get my army combat-ready.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.167
Lana?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.218
I’m leaving Lex.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.695
Lana, I know this is where I’m supposed
to say, "I’m sorry." But I can’t.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.526
Clark, I came here to say goodbye.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.825
Lex is going to be very angry.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.077
It’s dangerous.
I have to leave Smallville.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.418
Lana, you don’t have to worry about Lex.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.130
You don’t have to be afraid.
I can protect you from him, from anything.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.551
You can’t this time.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.518
Clark, I’m sorry.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.271
Just know that I will always love you.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.913
Wait. Lana.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.504
I can’t lose you again.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.793
Not without telling you the truth
about me.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.177
Clark, I already know about your powers.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.592
There’s more.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.349
I’m from another planet.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.317
It’s called Krypton.

12:23.701 --> 12:28.320
It's light years away,
and my parents sent me here to save me.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.246
They sent me to Earth
just before Krypton was destroyed.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.593
Please say something.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.877
You’re still the same Clark Kent to me.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.965
I guess there’s no reason for you to go.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.755
We can be together now.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.517
-You’ll be safe.
-You won’t be.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.222
There’s not many things
that can hurt me.

13:38.735 --> 13:42.023
But you’re not invincible.
You have a weakness.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.904
How do you know that?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.904
Did someone tell you that?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.536
It was Lionel, wasn’t it?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.669
Lana, you need to tell me
everything you know.

14:15.730 --> 14:19.598
Clark, Lionel threatened to kill you
if I didn’t marry Lex.

14:39.128 --> 14:44.623
Martha, I am calling to congratulate
the newest United States senator.

14:44.801 --> 14:49.010
l have no doubt that Capitol Hill will
never be the same, now that you are--

14:51.808 --> 14:53.844
Clark, what are you doing here?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.888
What I should have done a long time ago.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.852
You come into my life, pretending to be
some kind of guardian angel.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.442
-You’re exactly the opposite.
-No, you got it wrong.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.993
-I swear.
-Your words mean nothing to me.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.948
No, Clark. If Lana has spoken to you,
I know what you must be thinking.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.990
-But you’ve got to listen.
-l’ve listened to you for too long.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.455
Lex is tracking a wraith
from the Phantom Zone.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.745
I had to force Lana to marry him.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.542
It was the only way she could get close
to get the information I needed to help you.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.470
No. I never asked for your help
and I never will.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.602
You’re not a murderer. You’re Kal-El.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.509
Don’t call me by that name.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.053
Stop.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.353
This man is on our side.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.105
He’s an emissary of Jor-El.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.696
Subject en route and fully anesthetized.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.957
I’ll meet you at base.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.209
Lex, we have to talk.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.417
We most certainly do...

16:10.595 --> 16:11.880
...but it’ll have to wait.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.594
I’ll be back tonight.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.221
I won’t be.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.432
Lex, I can’t live like this anymore.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.845
Yeah, I don’t blame you.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.186
Living a lie in a marriage
you never wanted.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.604
It must take its toll after a while.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.270
You're the expert.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.649
Setting up a nursery...

16:34.243 --> 16:36.154
...an heirloom crib...

16:36.579 --> 16:42.165
...the tears of joy in your eyes
when you saw that ultrasound.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.333
What kind of a toll does that take, Lex?

16:52.470 --> 16:54.677
What in God’s name
are you talking about?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.589
I’m talking about the massive amounts
of hormones...

16:57.767 --> 17:01.351
...that you injected into my veins
to make me believe I was pregnant.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.639
What kind of a monster are you?

17:07.068 --> 17:10.276
I don’t know where you’re getting
your information from, Lana...

17:10.446 --> 17:12.562
...but it’s nothing but slander.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.776
You know I would never--

17:15.284 --> 17:16.615
Don’t lie, Lex.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.742
It’s too late for all that.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.706
This marriage is over.

17:27.964 --> 17:32.048
Lana, I know I'm far from perfect...

17:33.136 --> 17:35.297
...but you can’t deny
what we have between us.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.963
Lex, all there is between us
are lies on top of lies.

17:40.101 --> 17:44.765
Lana, everything I’ve ever done,
it’s because I love you.

17:45.815 --> 17:49.307
You aren’t capable of love, Lex.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.021
You never were.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.668
It’s Clark, isn’t it?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.838
You never could get over him...

18:22.643 --> 18:25.885
...even if he is the greatest liar
of them all.

18:32.195 --> 18:35.028
Clark means more to me
than you ever will.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.779
Lana—

18:44.957 --> 18:47.790
That’s the last time you’ll ever touch me.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.877
Do you really think
I could just let you walk away?

18:58.387 --> 19:01.003
What are you going to do, Lex?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.639
Kill me?

19:05.937 --> 19:09.600
Because it’s the only way
you’re gonna keep me in this mansion.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.085
I know. I know.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.714
The methods I have to use
seem cruel, heartless.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.421
But the truth is,
I am using them to protect you.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.256
None of this makes any sense.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.172
It was when Lex was possessed
with Zod.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.057
I became possessed
with all your father’s knowledge.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.891
I found myself writing in Kryptonian,
the symbol for power.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.101
It was a beacon.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.569
The same beacon Jor-El used
when he needed me.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.066
You knew my father?

20:00.241 --> 20:03.278
I worked for Jor-El,
bringing criminals to justice.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.613
When Krypton was on the verge
of annihilation...

20:05.788 --> 20:08.279
...he asked me to keep an eye out
for you.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.991
-Where have you been all these years?
-Watching from a distance.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.787
Your father wanted you to pass the test
without any help.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.627
He wasn’t to interfere
unless it was absolutely necessary.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.793
When you unleashed those phantoms,
I didn’t have a choice.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.462
Like what happened at the docks,
in Seattle.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.256
-Or when that phantom infected my mind.
-That’s right.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.177
Unfortunately, I’ve lost a step since then.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.855
What happened?

20:33.816 --> 20:34.805
Nothing.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.274
That’s not nothing.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.027
I had a run-in with the last phantom.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.116
I have to leave Earth’s atmosphere
to heal.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.911
But ﬁrst I must complete the job
I started.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.462
I’ll go after the phantom.
I have the crystal.

20:55.630 --> 20:59.214
-I doubt that crystal will work.
-lt’s not an ordinary phantom.

20:59.383 --> 21:04.377
It’s the product
of a Kryptonian lab experiment.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.932
It’s destroying one human being
after another...

21:07.099 --> 21:10.967
...desperately searching
for the only host...

21:11.145 --> 21:15.889
...that will insure its survival,
a Kryptonian body.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.312
Where’s the phantom?

21:19.487 --> 21:21.694
If you were to get infected,
it could kill you.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.355
People are being killed every day.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.449
If anyone’s gonna stop this phantom,
it’s gonna be me.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.094
Reeves Dam?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.437
I don’t get it.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.744
You said the symptoms were black eyes
and a high fever, right?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.423
That and a bad temper.

22:21.590 --> 22:25.333
Your hack worked. I’m into the QPP
database. I’ll start searching police records.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.501
Here we go.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.423
There was an 8-year-old boy admitted
to a hospital 13 miles away from that cabin.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.262
Blackened corneas, high fever,
explosive tendencies.

22:34.437 --> 22:37.429
-The doctors didn’t know what was wrong.
-What hospital is he at?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.891
Saint Mary’s.

22:39.066 --> 22:43.059
But that’s not gonna get us anywhere
because it says here the boy disappeared.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.941
I have the police report.

22:47.116 --> 22:51.780
A maintenance worker said he saw the boy
being loaded into an unmarked helicopter.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.194
This has gotta be Lex.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.160
So Lex is tracking a wraith
from the Phantom Zone...

22:56.333 --> 22:58.540
...and Lionel Luthor
is your new father ﬁgure?

22:58.711 --> 23:01.794
-This is a lot of excitement for one day.
-Yeah, there’s more.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.621
Lana’s leaving him.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.251
That’s a happy headline.
Why didn’t you say anything?

23:09.972 --> 23:11.633
Chloe...

23:11.807 --> 23:13.343
...I told Lana my secret.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.471
She knows everything.
She knows that I’m...

23:19.774 --> 23:20.889
...an alien.

23:25.696 --> 23:31.316
So I guess we have a new charter member
of the Clark Kent secret-keeping club.

23:31.494 --> 23:32.483
What did she say?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.408
She kissed me.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.368
That’s fantastic.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.168
You’ve been wanting this forever.
You just—

23:46.342 --> 23:48.378
You must be on cloud 99.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.635
I will be, as soon as
I deal with this phantom.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.659
What are you doing down here?

24:19.542 --> 24:24.036
I’m an engineering major at Met U and
I’m doing a paper on hydroelectric power.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.750
-The man on the phone--
-Go back and get out of here.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.634
I’m not going anywhere until you tell me
what’s going on at this dam.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.841
You’re not a student.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.555
Come on, let’s go for a walk.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.426
Okay, you got it.
You’re the guy with the gun.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.272
Looks like we got ourselves a wild one.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.277
Wait until you see my claws.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.840
Chloe....

26:09.109 --> 26:12.067
I’m through with you Luthors.
I ’m leaving Smallville.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.275
-Lana, I’m minutes away. Just stay where—
-I don’t trust you.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.155
I don’t trust anyone anymore.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.191
Lana, stay calm. Please.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.076
It’s too late.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.236
Lex hit me.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.158
All right, I’m here.
I’m pulling up right now.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.952
I’m getting out of here
and I’m never coming back.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.546
Lana!

27:17.845 --> 27:19.585
Lex has the phantom.

27:19.763 --> 27:24.723
He used an unmarked helicopter to kidnap
a boy from the same village in Quebec.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.142
What happened to you?

27:35.779 --> 27:37.610
Clark, l--

27:43.245 --> 27:45.736
I don’t know how to tell you this.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.750
Tell me what?

27:52.588 --> 27:54.499
It’s...

27:56.425 --> 27:57.881
...Lana. She’s--

27:58.385 --> 28:00.216
She—

28:00.888 --> 28:02.219
She what?

28:03.932 --> 28:05.547
She’s gone.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.300
She’s gone?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.604
What do you mean, gone?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.067
She’s dead, son.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.569
No.

28:22.743 --> 28:26.235
It was a bomb in her car.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.786
I don’t believe you.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.248
I was there, Clark.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.425
I saw it happen.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.200
I’m so sorry.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.833
I’m so sorry.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.295
She was gonna leave him.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.965
He didn’t let her leave.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.555
Where’s Lex?

29:32.729 --> 29:33.889
Clark....

29:35.649 --> 29:37.014
Tell me where Lex is.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.434
I can’t let you do something
you’ll regret for the rest of your life.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.765
Oh, no.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.429
Oh, God.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.814
Lois, it’s gonna be all right. Okay?

30:18.984 --> 30:20.895
I’m gonna get you help.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.105
Oh, my God.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.233
Oh, my God.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.239
Lois?

30:31.413 --> 30:33.995
Come on, Lois, you’re a ﬁghter.
Come on.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.452
Come on, Lois.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.628
Come on.

30:46.053 --> 30:49.341
You’re the strongest girl I know.
Come on.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.133
Please.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.844
You can’t die.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.055
I can’t lose you.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.312
I love you too much.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.691
Please.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.493
Chloe?

32:00.377 --> 32:01.867
Chloe?

32:02.296 --> 32:03.786
Wake up.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.173
Honey, wake up.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.663
No discernible activity from the subject.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.918
Twenty-four hours are almost up.

32:45.589 --> 32:47.204
Let’s move.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.371
Draw the blood.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.692
This better be it.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.998
Yes. Well, it looks perfectly normal.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.167
Let’s hope it isn’t.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.425
Hope isn’t a word
in my vocabulary, doctor.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.304
I need results.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.279
Do we have what we need?

33:57.703 --> 34:01.867
It looks like your ﬂeet of ﬁghters
are about to get their jet fuel.

34:21.435 --> 34:22.424
VIEW

34:25.147 --> 34:26.227
Wait.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.314
Wait.

35:39.346 --> 35:40.381
Clark.

35:41.515 --> 35:42.880
Clark, wait.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.681
She was your wife.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.141
Now’s not the time to lecture me
about my marriage.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.228
-Why’d you do it? Just tell me.
-Get your hands off me.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.267
Were you afraid she'd bring you down...

35:56.446 --> 35:59.188
...or was it too humiliating
that she was gonna leave you?

36:01.034 --> 36:02.490
Why did you have to kill her?

36:04.412 --> 36:06.073
-Why?
-What are you talking about?

36:06.248 --> 36:07.954
You already know.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.411
Lana is dead.

36:12.087 --> 36:16.547
-No.
-No, you don’t have to act so surprised.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.126
You’re the one who killed her.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.839
You put a bomb in her car.
You’re the one who killed her.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.091
Get out of here.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.472
He’ll kill us both.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.931
He’s right.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.733
At last...

36:43.910 --> 36:47.027
...a Kryptonian.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.648
Thanks for sharing.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.566
I feel a lot better now.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.852
What just happened?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.021
I took a little piece of your DNA.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.735
And now I’m gonna take your life.

37:54.564 --> 37:58.898
-Put your hands up.
-My wife, something’s happened to her.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.058
Hands up now!

38:04.866 --> 38:06.276
You’re making a mistake.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.446
You’re under arrest for the murder
of Lana Luthor.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.585
Clark.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.746
Son, what is it?

39:02.924 --> 39:04.630
That’s not me.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.541
It’s the phantom.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.552
How do you like my new look?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.736
Thanks. That’s just what I needed.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.670
What the hell are you?

39:50.055 --> 39:53.673
I’m you, only a little more bizarre.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.369
