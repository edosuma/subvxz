22:42.191 --> 22:44.900
Mason: What the fuck is that doctorate degree doing for you now huh?

22:46.025 --> 22:48.275
Dr. Spencer: well since you brought it up

22:48.566 --> 22:49.941
Dr. Spencer: Look...

22:50.066 --> 22:52.775
Dr. Spencer: that message stated that only four more can get on that boat

22:54.108 --> 22:56.814
Dr. Spencer: I think your right

22:56.816 --> 22:59.525
Dr. Spencer: why don't we reduce the numbers that make it to that boat

23:00.566 --> 23:03.275
climbing down metal stairs - eaters growl in the distance

23:04.691 --> 23:07.400
Dr. Spencer: Your a bloody fool you know that?

23:09.108 --> 23:11.816
Dr. Spencer: I been lost out here for six months with you

23:16.566 --> 23:18.608
Mason: You slimy little fucking prick

23:19.150 --> 23:21.858
Mason: So you want me to start killing some of them off

23:22.275 --> 23:25.191
Dr. Spencer: Well we both have to make sure we both have a seat on that ship

23:25.483 --> 23:28.191
Dr. Spencer: I need you to make sure I get on board

23:28.358 --> 23:30.441
Dr. Spencer: Besides you don't like those assholes anyway

23:40.400 --> 23:43.233
Mason: Look around asshole, who the fuck needs money?

23:43.566 --> 23:44.650
Dr. Spencer: We do

23:45.733 --> 23:48.608
Dr. Spencer: Look I heard at the last camp we were at...

23:49.983 --> 23:51.441
Dr. Spencer: That they're close to a cure

23:53.941 --> 23:56.233
Mason: Weren't you the one who created this shit?

23:57.358 --> 23:58.441
Eaters growling in the distance

23:58.858 --> 24:01.275
Dr. Spencer: (sighs) Let's just say my curiousity is peaked

24:04.108 --> 24:05.816
Mason: Like I said, what's in it for me?

24:07.858 --> 24:11.525
Dr. Spencer: I have a safe house, water, food, medicine

24:11.900 --> 24:12.983
Dr. Spencer: To last a life time

24:14.108 --> 24:17.858
Dr. Spencer: I wouldn't be out here if you stupid government
 assholes didn't force me and my nurse out here.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.233
Dr. Spencer: I was fine where I was at

24:19.900 --> 24:23.566
Mason: Well those fucking government
 assholes sent us to retrieve your ungrateful ass

24:23.816 --> 24:26.439
Mason: and good thing we fucking did, cause right now

24:26.441 --> 24:29.275
Mason: some eater would be shitting

24:29.525 --> 24:31.981
Mason: Now shut the fuck up and lets go!

24:31.983 --> 24:34.314
Running sounds, followed by a large metal clang,
 several eaters are heard in the distance approaching

24:34.316 --> 24:37.983
Mason: Come on!

24:44.358 --> 24:48.025
Soft music plays, light footsteps and crickets sing softly

24:50.983 --> 24:53.606
Alex: How... How much further is it?

24:53.608 --> 24:56.023

25:12.441 --> 25:13.941
walking on gravel

25:21.733 --> 25:23.233
Chris: We might as well rest here for a bit

25:27.525 --> 25:29.025
wipes hands off

25:30.150 --> 25:31.650
Alex: So what's at the pier?

25:34.191 --> 25:35.691
Chris: sighs

25:36.191 --> 25:37.691
Chris: I made a promise to a friend

25:38.316 --> 25:40.358
Chris: So when I get there I gotta deliver a package

25:41.483 --> 25:42.983
Alex: (soft laugh)

25:43.150 --> 25:47.566
Alex: What are you like Tom Hanks from Cast Away?
 He had to deliver one package too, remember?

25:49.650 --> 25:51.150
Chris: You better hope I deliver this package

25:52.441 --> 25:53.941
Chris: So anyways, what happened to your brother?

25:57.400 --> 25:58.900
Alex: When the outbreak broke out

26:00.233 --> 26:05.775
Alex: He and I... We headed to a camp
 where there were a lot of survivors

26:06.650 --> 26:10.566
Alex: Unfortunately a lot of Eaters showed up one night and...

26:11.191 --> 26:14.650
Alex: (sighs) In the midst of everything I
 guess we just got separated

26:17.233 --> 26:19.816
Chris: Younger brother?
 Alex: ... Yeah

26:21.775 --> 26:26.775
Chris: Did you check any of the corpses to see if he was one of the undead?

26:27.025 --> 26:29.150
Alex: Of course I checked

26:29.233 --> 26:31.358
Alex: Dead or alive I have to know for sure

26:34.025 --> 26:39.108
Alex: So... Why do you play with that bracelet so much?

26:42.358 --> 26:44.483
Chris: (Sighs)

26:45.691 --> 26:48.900
Chris: Belonged to my.. girlfriend. Well my fiancé

26:58.941 --> 27:02.400
soft sad music plays

27:03.275 --> 27:05.525
Chris: It happened so fast.

27:06.233 --> 27:10.275
Chris: all I remember is seeing a lot... Seeing a lot of blood

27:11.525 --> 27:16.441
Chris: (soft chuckle) I feel like a fucking idiot
 when I just look back at it now

27:17.150 --> 27:18.400
Chris: cause I'm standing there

27:18.483 --> 27:21.858
Chris: just holding my hand out, ready to propose to her

27:24.608 --> 27:28.941
Chris: Just a split second her smile fades and she screaming

27:29.650 --> 27:31.900
Chris: so yeah she's with me

27:40.400 --> 27:42.650
Chris: We better keep walking

27:44.650 --> 27:46.900
Chris: don't forget your water (footsteps on the gravel)

27:47.066 --> 27:49.316

28:23.025 --> 28:24.733
Hunter: You alright over there?

28:29.316 --> 28:33.400
Hunter: Listen man, nobody has enough heart
 to go through your bag and steal your beef jerky

28:33.441 --> 28:34.650
Darren still rummaging

28:34.733 --> 28:36.523
Hunter: better yet we gotta stay frosty

28:36.525 --> 28:39.733
Hunter: we gotta make sure that the group gets enough sleep
 for the next two hours before we roll out

28:39.816 --> 28:42.106
Darren: you know what? We all have one
 shred of humanity left

28:42.108 --> 28:42.814

Darren: that there was a life before all this shit

28:49.733 --> 28:51.108
Hunter: Man that seems so long ago

28:52.066 --> 28:56.358
Darren: You know my last call was a
 guy who got his fucking throat ripped out.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.483
Darren: with human teeth

28:59.150 --> 29:02.775
Darren: You can't see that shit and
 continue on with regular life, that's the day

29:03.066 --> 29:05.691
Darren: I knew it was nothing. I got one thing left

29:06.275 --> 29:08.775
Hunter: I was taking this group on a hiking trip

29:09.066 --> 29:11.566
Hunter: Right before the world decided to go to hell

29:12.400 --> 29:14.900
Hunter: I wanted to go find my ex wife

29:15.483 --> 29:17.983

Darren: I'm... I'm glad you didn't go after her

29:22.525 --> 29:25.275
Darren: There's nothing you could do with one person alone in the woods

29:25.525 --> 29:27.316
Darren: We need you here

01:12:19.525 --> 01:12:24.233
Mia: (Exhales) Leo is turning.
 I'm not Tyler, i can't stop the process.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.733
But if that was Hunters friend..
 we could've really use his help right now

01:12:30.358 --> 01:12:31.816
Mason: He can barely help himself.

01:12:32.108 --> 01:12:34.983
Mason: He's probably looking for a handout
 or Hunter, or some shit.

01:12:35.733 --> 01:12:38.191
Mason: I should've told him his boy's
 pushing up daisies.

01:12:38.941 --> 01:12:41.066
Mia: You know, every time i think you're
 almost human

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:44.356
You remind me, you're nothing
 but a used tampon.

01:12:44.358 --> 01:12:45.525
Mason: Really Mia?

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:49.108
Mason: I have a kid, in the corner dying

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.566
I lost my friend!

01:12:52.108 --> 01:12:53.275
Mia: You mean Darren?

01:12:54.316 --> 01:12:56.233
Mia: I thought you said he was dead.

01:12:56.358 --> 01:12:59.400
Wait...did you even see him die?

01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:02.148
Or did you just leave him there to rot.
 Mason: No actually, i didn't see him die.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.025
I was too busy rescuing Ben!

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:07.025
Mason: While he led the Eaters away.

01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:12.108
Look, I get it. I'm not a leader, but i will get us
 to that ship!

01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:13.148
Mia: Why?!

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:14.733
Why are you carrying this burden?!

01:13:15.066 --> 01:13:17.481
We all know what this is about.
 This isn't your job!

01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:20.358
Are you trying to prove to us
 you have a conscience after all?

01:13:20.691 --> 01:13:22.400
Mason: They look up to me now.

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:25.608
Okay? And i always complete my missions

01:13:25.691 --> 01:13:29.483
Mia: I hope so Mason, because we have
 a greedy Doc, a sick kid.

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:31.650
And Thames who wouldn't mind killing you!

01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:35.358
Mason: What about you?

01:13:38.025 --> 01:13:39.816
You didn't say you'll kill me.

01:13:41.275 --> 01:13:45.066
(Sad music)

01:13:58.983 --> 01:14:01.731
Leo: Mason...

01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:06.108
Leo: Darren said he was always going
 to protect me, and he's not even around anymore.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.233
Mason: Leo, you're not looking too good
 go lay down.

01:14:09.733 --> 01:14:10.858
Leo: My heart is cold.

01:14:11.066 --> 01:14:13.525
Leo: I don't feel inside...
 (Mia cocks gun)

01:14:13.775 --> 01:14:14.650
Where's Hunter?

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.025
(Leo growls)

01:14:16.066 --> 01:14:18.356
Eric: No no! Leo!

01:14:18.358 --> 01:14:21.441
Eric: No Leo...no!

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:25.358
Eric: Why Leo?! Why would you do that?!
 Ima kill that!..

01:14:25.775 --> 01:14:29.191
Leo! (Eric cries) Leo!

01:14:29.775 --> 01:14:32.150
Eric: Leo! Leo!

01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:33.400
Eric: Ima kill this bitch!

01:14:33.816 --> 01:14:36.108
Mia: I did what i had to do.

01:14:36.691 --> 01:14:39.483
Mia: Wipe your mouth.

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:43.025
Mia: We're losing everyone Mason..

01:14:43.316 --> 01:14:44.691
Mason: We're not losing everyone.

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:49.108
We're still here.

01:14:51.775 --> 01:14:54.441
(Wood crackling in fire)

01:14:59.066 --> 01:15:00.689
Doc: (Breathing heavy)

01:15:00.691 --> 01:15:03.900
Doc: Where's your team? I thought you
 said you..you had people that came with you.

01:15:04.025 --> 01:15:07.108
Darren: Yeah, we're about a mile south.
 Doc: Thank you.

01:15:07.233 --> 01:15:08.981
Darren: I just got one guy I'm waiting on.

01:15:08.983 --> 01:15:10.314
Darren: It's our last gun.

01:15:10.316 --> 01:15:12.608
(Doc desperately swallows water)
 Darren: But, its been 3 days.

01:15:12.983 --> 01:15:15.358
Darren: So I'm getting ready to pack up.

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:18.358
Doc: Is that (Doc places down water) is that him?

01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:20.233
Darren: I don't know

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:22.650
he's gotta a gun on his back? Rifle?

01:15:22.691 --> 01:15:23.275
Doc: Yeah, Yeah.

01:15:23.358 --> 01:15:24.775
(Darren laughs with excitement) That's him.

01:15:33.316 --> 01:15:34.731
Darren: How you doing man?

01:15:34.733 --> 01:15:36.150
Darren: You alright? You hurt?

01:15:36.441 --> 01:15:37.858
Darren: What took you soo long?

01:15:38.025 --> 01:15:39.941
Darren: Living out here for 3 days waiting for you.

01:15:40.566 --> 01:15:41.523
Mason: Got caught up.

01:15:41.525 --> 01:15:43.191
Darren: Yeah? Doing what?

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:45.566
Mason: Listen Darren.

01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:47.525
Darren: Alright, talk, what's on your mind man?

01:15:49.275 --> 01:15:51.483
Mason: I ran into your sister, Nina.

01:15:51.608 --> 01:15:53.025
Darren: Okay, and my father?

01:15:54.525 --> 01:15:56.608
Darren: Were they at the bunker yet?
 Or are they still on their way.

01:15:56.733 --> 01:15:57.398
Mason: Darren.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.314
Darren: What?!

01:15:58.316 --> 01:16:00.900
Mason: When I got there,
 Nina and your dad were arguing

01:16:00.983 --> 01:16:02.566
Darren: Yea, it happens, he's a dick.

01:16:02.816 --> 01:16:04.233
Mason: Well Eaters came out

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:06.566

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.316
Mason: He pushed Nina into an Eater.
