Hank:
so, heh...

00:33.767 --> 00:35.433
Meeting a woman
on the internet.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.667
How do you
like that?

00:36.733 --> 00:38.467
Now, I'll take care
of everything

00:38.533 --> 00:39.600
while you're away.

00:39.667 --> 00:40.900
I even made a tape

00:40.967 --> 00:42.767
of all your plants'
favorite songs.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.667
Oh, bill, peggy
and I were thinking

00:44.733 --> 00:47.000
bobby could take care
of boomhauer's house

00:47.067 --> 00:48.133
while he's gone.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.833
I see.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.967
Bobby's a good kid, but, uh...

00:52.033 --> 00:54.100
You looked at his room lately?

00:55.500 --> 00:56.633
So what do you say?

00:56.700 --> 00:58.133
It'll be good
for the boy

00:58.200 --> 01:00.067
teach him some
responsibility.

01:00.067 --> 01:02.767
Yeah, man, whatever, you know,
like, lot to do, man.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.500
Water them bonsai, feed the koi.

01:04.566 --> 01:06.067
Just think, bill.

01:06.133 --> 01:09.067
This'll free you up for
new challenges. Heh-heh.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.867
Like what?

01:10.933 --> 01:13.200
So if we could
have the keys?

01:16.100 --> 01:18.100
Oops.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.300
Here.

01:26.733 --> 01:29.633
Now, you know I'm not really
here for a free haircut.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.900
I'm here because I like
to check up on what's happening

01:32.967 --> 01:34.633
what's going on, what's now.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.633
I got to tell you, baby doll,
you are very now.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.967
Thank you.

01:39.067 --> 01:40.733
( chuckling ):
you're welcome.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.533
The name is
rad thibodayoks-sss.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.633
Here's my card, you know, so...
you know I'm for real.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.900
"radical concepts."

01:47.967 --> 01:50.200
( laughing ):
that sounds exciting.

01:50.267 --> 01:53.567
Well, only if you think
the fast-paced, celebrity-filled

01:53.633 --> 01:55.833
life of a concert promoter
is exciting.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.733
Oh, and your name is rad.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.700
How clever.

02:02.867 --> 02:04.633
You know, I've noticed that, uh

02:04.700 --> 02:06.567
we've been talking a lot
about rad

02:06.633 --> 02:08.866
and not too much
about Miss sweet luanne.

02:08.933 --> 02:10.133
Ah, me, too.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.867
Well, tell me something.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.733
You got a lover?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.233
You know, I don't even
have a boyfriend.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.567
My last one, buckley,
blew up in a propane explosion.

02:19.633 --> 02:22.633
You know, I can tell you're
a very sensitive young woman

02:22.700 --> 02:24.067
and sensitive people

02:24.133 --> 02:26.467
they do have a hard time
in our society today.

02:26.533 --> 02:28.133
I mean, I should know.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.500
As a self-proclaimed genius

02:30.567 --> 02:35.433
i, myself, rad thibodayoks-sss,
am often misunderstood.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.167
Self-proclaimed genius?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.567
yes.

02:39.633 --> 02:42.533
You poor thing.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.300
Oh... What do
you think?

02:45.367 --> 02:47.067
Damn, that's
a fine job, baby.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.833
That's such a fine job,
you know what I'm going to do?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.633
I'm going to ask you out.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.300
See, you don't know it yet,
but you're going to say yes.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.333
He's right!

02:56.400 --> 02:57.733
I'm trusting you

02:57.800 --> 02:59.567
with boomhauer's keys, bobby.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.900
Now, remember, it doesn't
just unlock the front door

03:02.967 --> 03:06.667
it unlocks a new phase in your
life as a responsible adult.

03:06.733 --> 03:09.667
Why is Mr. Dauterive
looking at us like that?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.967
He's proud of
you, too, bobby.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.067
( phone ringing )

03:33.067 --> 03:35.967
yo, man, dang ol'
leave a message, man.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.333
I'm busy right now.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.200
Just leave name, number, date.

03:39.267 --> 03:42.233
No dang ol'... That soliciting,
nothing like that.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.733
Dale:
boomhauer, pick up.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.800
Boomhauer, pick up.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.733
Pick up, boomhauer.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.533
P... Oh, right, you're away.

03:54.433 --> 03:57.300
( car horn playing tune )

03:57.367 --> 03:59.400
hey, good lookin'.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.533
hey.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.733
Bobby, this is
my new friend rad.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.067
That's what

04:07.067 --> 04:09.067
his license plate says.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.100
Well, you see,
in the industry

04:11.167 --> 04:14.167
a man is only as
good as his word,
so keep it.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.966
You know, nobody's going to know
that you are a man...

04:17.067 --> 04:19.567
Who keeps... His word.

04:19.632 --> 04:21.899
You break it... Oh, god...

04:21.966 --> 04:24.267
Man, I'm telling you,
the freebies

04:24.333 --> 04:26.833
they dry up
like a puddle in the sun.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.300
Whoa.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.333
Rad, what do you mean
by "the industry"?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.067
The entertainment industry.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.333
Whoa!

04:36.400 --> 04:38.167
( chuckling ):
there you go.

04:38.233 --> 04:42.433
( playing jazz )

04:44.800 --> 04:49.733
( scat singing badly )

04:49.800 --> 04:51.733
doo-oh, my!

04:58.633 --> 05:00.933
Dad, I would
like you to meet

05:01.067 --> 05:03.467
a new friend of
mine and luanne's.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.167
Hey, hey there, partner.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.100
Name's rad thibodayoks-sss.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.967
♪ pleased to meet you... ♪

05:09.067 --> 05:11.633
here you go,
businessman to businessman.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.300
Isn't that pronounced
"thibodeaux"?

05:15.367 --> 05:17.433
Well, you know,
sometimes, by mistake.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.767
But no damage done.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.067
Now, luanne has
told me about you

05:21.133 --> 05:23.900
so I know you're going
to love these free cds.

05:23.967 --> 05:25.967
"aol"?

05:26.067 --> 05:28.067
Mm-hmm. And guess what.

05:28.067 --> 05:31.067
You sign up right now,
I get ten free hours.

05:31.067 --> 05:33.067
All you got to do is tell them

05:33.067 --> 05:37.600
that "sooorad at aol.com"
sent you.

05:37.667 --> 05:38.933
( chuckling )

05:41.733 --> 05:44.633
hey, mom, dad,
got it goin' on?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.833
I got what doing what?

05:46.900 --> 05:49.233
Bobby, what have you
done to your sleeves?

05:49.300 --> 05:52.433
Well, this is
how rad sleeves himself.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.900
It's industry.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.767
You know, I don't much
care for that rad fella.

05:56.833 --> 06:01.467
Rad thibodayoks is
a self-proclaimed genius.

06:20.733 --> 06:23.233
I'm going to make you
a sandwich, sweet luanne.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.633
What kind you want?

06:24.700 --> 06:25.933
I'd like a...

06:26.067 --> 06:29.367
Um... I don't know.

06:29.433 --> 06:32.067
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
what's wrong, baby doll?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.067
Nothing.

06:34.067 --> 06:37.833
( voice breaking ):
oh, it's just... Well...

06:37.900 --> 06:39.967
I didn't ever
get to go

06:40.067 --> 06:42.333
anywhere this
fancy with buckley.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.800
Well, except his
funeral reception.

06:45.867 --> 06:47.733
Oh, there, there, sweetness.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.400
It's different now.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.767
Rad's here, baby.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.067
Rad's... Here.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.400
Say my name.

06:54.467 --> 06:55.633
rad.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.200
Mmm...

06:58.267 --> 07:00.167
Say, a.j.,
got it goin' on?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.067
Whoops!

07:06.133 --> 07:08.933
Careful, bobby,
you could have wet rad.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.700
Oh, rad's cool with that.

07:10.767 --> 07:12.233
Aren't you, rad?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.467
Uh, rad, I was
speaking to you.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.833
Bobby... Listen,
I know you want my attention

07:17.900 --> 07:19.600
and that's
nothing I can't handle

07:19.667 --> 07:24.267
but at the moment,
I am busy with the lady.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.067
You can see luanne anytime

07:26.133 --> 07:28.467
but I have
school and stuff to do.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.067
I have to take care

07:30.100 --> 07:32.567
of boomhauer's house
while he's away.

07:32.633 --> 07:33.967
Mm-hmm.

07:34.067 --> 07:38.233
How long is, uh... He away for?

07:40.300 --> 07:42.800
♪ pleased to see you... ♪

07:42.867 --> 07:46.400

07:46.467 --> 07:48.167
I'll go put this
on the bed.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.367
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.833
You better not do that now.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.233
Jeremy's in there.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.567
He is busy, if you
know what I mean.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.967
Ha-ha-ha. In the meantime

07:57.067 --> 07:58.967
you know, I am feeling
kind of thirsty

07:59.067 --> 08:01.533
and my beverage is
on the south end of the levee.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.167
You know where boomhauer keeps
his spare stash?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.867
I'll get his number from bobby.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.433
We can call him and ask him.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.367
( both laughing )

08:09.433 --> 08:10.700
listen to you...

08:10.767 --> 08:14.133
Hey, does boomhauer know
about this party?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.767
Uh, does he need to?

08:15.833 --> 08:17.267
yes.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.767
why?

08:18.833 --> 08:19.967
This isn't fair.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
I am not a self-
proclaimed genius

08:22.067 --> 08:25.167
so I don't always have
as good an answer as you do.

08:25.233 --> 08:28.100
Wait, wait, I know why.

08:28.167 --> 08:29.633
Because you should
tell people

08:29.700 --> 08:32.133
if you're going to throw
a party in their house

08:32.200 --> 08:33.667
without asking them.

08:33.732 --> 08:36.133
And the rad I fell in love with
ought to know that.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.332
So come on.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.732
Make everyone leave!

08:40.799 --> 08:42.366
Whoa, now, luanne.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.167
You don't want to make me
and Mr. Boomhauser

08:45.233 --> 08:47.100
look like bad hosts, do you?

08:48.300 --> 08:50.233
That's it,
rad thibodayoks-sss!

08:50.300 --> 08:53.633
I am not your
girlfriend anymore!

08:53.700 --> 08:55.300
Wait a minute, now.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.233
I never proclaimed you
to be my girlfriend, baby doll.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.200
( rad chuckling )

09:05.267 --> 09:06.800
welcome, buddy.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.633
Enjoy the music
and the free food.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.667
I will not!

09:11.433 --> 09:12.867
You get out of here!

09:12.933 --> 09:14.500
You, too! And you, too!

09:14.567 --> 09:16.633
This is a smoke-free house!

09:18.933 --> 09:23.400
The only thing hotter
than this tub is you two ladies.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.567
Uh-oh.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.800
Dad, I'm in my underpants.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.400
Yeah, that was
your decision.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.800
You got to live with it.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.600
Look at this place.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.500
12 years old
and drinking a beer?

09:43.567 --> 09:45.367
I didn't even
like it.

09:45.433 --> 09:47.300
Now you're just trying
to get me mad.

09:47.367 --> 09:50.433
Your father and I are replacing
you as boomhauer's house sitter.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.067
We'll be keeping the one dollar
a day for ourselves.

09:53.067 --> 09:56.067
That's right, and I'm taking
away your suitcase of props.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.767
Fine.

09:57.833 --> 10:01.100
I can do my comedy
without props.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.567
So, you ever notice how...

10:03.633 --> 10:05.100
How...?

10:05.167 --> 10:08.833
You can't take away my props!

10:11.933 --> 10:14.033
( sobbing )

10:14.100 --> 10:16.167
because of you,
i'm propless.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.433
Hey, you can't
throw those out.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.100
This cd is all I've
got left of rad.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.567
He didn't give it
to you, bobby.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.100
He gave it to me.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.967
You were never even part
of his inner circle.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.200
You were just
a hanger-on.

10:31.267 --> 10:32.967
Take that back.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.900
Like a.j.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.500
State your purpose.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.967
Mr. Gribble, I'm having
a problem with luanne.

10:44.033 --> 10:46.767
Do you know anything about
getting even with people

10:46.833 --> 10:48.700
who have done something
bad to you?

10:48.767 --> 10:53.133
( loudly ):
uh, no, bobby,
nothing at all.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.467
( chuckles )

11:11.400 --> 11:13.067

11:17.300 --> 11:19.467

11:19.533 --> 11:21.133
oh, bobby!

11:21.200 --> 11:25.300
( grunting )

11:25.367 --> 11:27.633
just gardening.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.533
( chuckling )

11:38.567 --> 11:39.867
ew!

11:39.933 --> 11:41.233
( bobby spitting )

11:41.300 --> 11:42.667
cut it out, bobby.

11:42.733 --> 11:44.100
No one's laughing.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.467
I didn't
do it.

11:45.533 --> 11:47.967
Bobby, we just saw you
spit dirt all over...

11:48.067 --> 11:52.333
Why would I put dirt
in my own fruit pie?

11:52.400 --> 11:54.233
My own fruit pie.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.333
Why you do a lot of things
is a mystery to me.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.933
( muffled chuckle )

11:59.067 --> 12:00.667
( growling )

12:08.367 --> 12:10.100
see you later,
aunt peggy.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.800
( people laughing )

12:17.400 --> 12:18.567
( growling )

12:18.633 --> 12:20.867
if I find out that
this was you

12:20.933 --> 12:22.767
and not a laundry
accident

12:22.833 --> 12:24.833
i'm going to be
really mad.

12:30.633 --> 12:32.100
huh?

12:36.367 --> 12:39.333
Well, how do you like that.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.267
Peggy, peggy,
come in here.

12:42.333 --> 12:43.733
Oh, my.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.300
Well, that's me.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.533
A camera in
the bedroom.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.433
This is kind of fun.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
This is hank hill
with the news.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.800
Hank, you are terrible.

13:04.067 --> 13:07.100
You're getting to be
a handful, bobby

13:07.167 --> 13:09.100
and nobody likes
a handful.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.267
aha.

13:23.067 --> 13:25.100
( humming tune )

13:32.900 --> 13:34.967
sweet tarts?

13:35.067 --> 13:37.233
( growling )

13:39.967 --> 13:44.167
oh, if this is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.800
Couldn't help
hearing the bubbles.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.367
Mind if I join?

13:48.433 --> 13:49.967
Oh, dear lord!

13:50.067 --> 13:53.533
Get the hell
out of here, dale.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.367
No! No!

13:57.433 --> 13:58.900
Oh, no!

13:58.967 --> 14:02.067
Is anything the
matter, luanne?

14:02.100 --> 14:05.533
My birth control pills
have stopped working.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.100
I should have known

14:07.167 --> 14:09.667
when they started
tasting sweet.

14:09.733 --> 14:10.900
Like candy?

14:10.967 --> 14:12.333
( laughing )

14:12.400 --> 14:14.633
this isn't funny,
bobby.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.167
Oh, I disagree.

14:16.233 --> 14:17.767
You don't understand.

14:17.833 --> 14:21.133
Every woman has to take
a birth control pill every day

14:21.200 --> 14:23.433
or else
they get pregnant.

14:24.567 --> 14:25.867
Just take two now.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.300
Hurry!

14:27.367 --> 14:29.067
That would destroy
my insides.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.300
That's how it works.

14:30.367 --> 14:31.633
Take 'em!

14:34.300 --> 14:35.967
( door opening )

14:36.067 --> 14:40.467
there's only one way to teach
dale the meaning of "no."

14:40.533 --> 14:43.767
Mom, dad, I've gotten
luanne pregnant!

14:45.200 --> 14:48.433
Luanne, I thought you
were smarter than this.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.767
I did.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.233
Can you imagine
the consequences

14:52.300 --> 14:54.200
if you had taken one
of those fake pills

14:54.267 --> 14:55.433
and had
unprotected se...

14:55.500 --> 14:56.767
ugh!

14:56.833 --> 14:59.167
I only got the pill
to clear up my complexion

14:59.233 --> 15:00.200
and regulate my...

15:00.267 --> 15:01.133
aw!

15:01.200 --> 15:03.300
Bobby's the one who messed

15:03.367 --> 15:04.500
with my medicine.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.200
You messed with
his fruit pies.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.067
After that,
he had nothing to lose.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.533
I'll go tell him the truth
right away.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.733
No, not so fast.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.833
Bobby has to learn
that what he did

15:13.900 --> 15:15.500
was completely
unacceptable.

15:15.567 --> 15:18.467
Now, as far as he knows,
you are still expecting.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.567
You want me to lie?

15:20.633 --> 15:22.933
Well, deceiving somebody
is never good.

15:23.067 --> 15:26.700
But in order to teach bobby
the meaning of responsibility...

15:26.767 --> 15:27.800
I'll do it!

15:30.267 --> 15:33.167
So, how's it
going there, sport?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.500
Not so good.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.133
Pretty big
screw-up, huh?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.500
I feel bad about it, dad.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.600
Well, heck, we all
make mistakes.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.100
The point is,
you can make up for them.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.700
Really? How?

15:44.767 --> 15:46.700
By doing the right thing,
of course.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.700
You're going to have
to marry luanne.

15:48.767 --> 15:51.200
But I'm only 12 years old.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.400
Well, just think, you could be
married for 80 years.

15:54.467 --> 15:57.367
Dad, you can't make
me marry luanne.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.867
Yes, I can, bobby.

15:58.933 --> 16:01.067
You're only
12 years old.

16:12.767 --> 16:16.067
Please, dad, I don't
want to marry luanne.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.133
Well, it's a little
late for that.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.233
You didn't take care
of boomhauer's

16:20.300 --> 16:23.367
you drank beer, you messed
with luanne's lady pills.

16:23.433 --> 16:26.700
I ask you, is that
responsible behavior?

16:26.767 --> 16:28.267
no.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.367
Well, then, having
to marry luanne

16:30.433 --> 16:32.300
will be a good
lesson for you.

16:34.700 --> 16:38.467
Luanne, I know we've had
our differences

16:38.533 --> 16:40.267
but I was kind of hoping

16:40.333 --> 16:42.800
we could make up
and not get married.

16:42.867 --> 16:46.767
Uncle hank, bobby's trying
to get out of marrying me!

16:46.833 --> 16:49.467
Hank:
bobby, you cut that out.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.400
Bill:
you barely touched
that sundae, bobby.

16:55.467 --> 16:57.467
I'm not really hungry.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.433
Come on, what kind of
bachelor party is this?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.400
Better live it up
while you can

17:02.467 --> 17:05.733
before the wife is
after you to watch
the waistline.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.200
( laughing )

17:07.267 --> 17:10.833
yep. This is the last
free night of your life.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.367
To Mr. And Mrs. Bobby hill.

17:13.433 --> 17:18.166
May their marriage be every bit
as wonderful as mine is.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.666
And as mine was.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.633
oh!

17:29.933 --> 17:32.200
Bobby, I've got to do
my homework.

17:32.267 --> 17:34.300
Homework.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.067
( dejected laugh )

17:36.100 --> 17:38.433
you go on and do your homework.

17:40.533 --> 17:43.267
Just let me watch you
for a little while.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.800
ew.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.700
Oh, my little man,
I brought this for you.

17:58.767 --> 18:01.500
Mom, mom, I don't want
to do this.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.667
Well, of course you don't.

18:10.333 --> 18:14.200
( piano playing
"the wedding march" )

18:16.433 --> 18:19.067
come, my child.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.067
( playing
"here comes the bride" )

18:28.967 --> 18:31.633
minh! Minh!
it's finally happening!

18:31.700 --> 18:35.167
Bobby hillbilly is marrying
hillbilly cousin!

18:35.233 --> 18:37.267
You owe me five dollars!

18:37.333 --> 18:38.933
In your face!

18:42.700 --> 18:46.700
Bobby, do you take luanne to be
your lawful wedded wife?

18:46.767 --> 18:49.767
To have and to hold,
to love and to cherish

18:49.833 --> 18:51.500
till death do you part?

18:51.567 --> 18:53.100
( gasping )

18:53.167 --> 18:55.100
that sounds like
a "yes" to me.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.833
All right.

18:56.900 --> 19:00.067
Luanne, do you take bobby to be
your lawful wedded husband?

19:00.067 --> 19:01.400
I do.

19:01.467 --> 19:04.833
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.933
Oh, bobby!

19:09.200 --> 19:11.633
Oh, no.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.167
I-i-I think I need to lie down.

19:16.733 --> 19:20.533
( playing "that's amore" )

19:22.167 --> 19:24.067
( gasping )

19:24.133 --> 19:25.633
oh, can I tell him now?

19:25.700 --> 19:27.833
Can I tell him how
we fooled him?

19:27.900 --> 19:31.333
Oh, luanne, I am really,
really sorry about this, honey

19:31.400 --> 19:32.967
but I have
some bad news.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.867
It turns out
that bill

19:34.933 --> 19:37.767
is actually
a licensed minister.

19:37.833 --> 19:42.100
You mean... I'm really married
to bobby?

19:42.167 --> 19:44.167
Legally, yes.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.967
Then I'll just get
a divorce.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.233
That's what I'll do.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.500
I'll say he hit me.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.900
I guess you could
do that

19:49.967 --> 19:52.300
but the law is,
you have to wait a year.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.800
That's to give you time
to patch things up.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.900
no!

19:56.967 --> 19:59.267
( chuckling )

20:01.567 --> 20:02.900
please, luanne

20:02.967 --> 20:06.267
I don't think
i'm ready for this yet.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.633
Look, we're going
to have to deal with

20:08.700 --> 20:10.033
this being married thing

20:10.100 --> 20:12.433
so the sooner we make
the rules, the better.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.300
I get to date as much
as I want with whoever I want.

20:15.367 --> 20:18.500
You can see connie if you want
to, but just not in public.

20:18.567 --> 20:19.667
No, I changed my mind.

20:19.733 --> 20:22.100
You can't see
connie ever.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.833
Look at the happy
newlyweds.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.167
( chuckling )

20:32.233 --> 20:34.900
how come they get
to be married

20:34.967 --> 20:36.433
when I never do?

20:36.500 --> 20:39.200
Why do they get
to be so happy?

20:39.267 --> 20:41.533
It's not fair.
it's not...

20:41.600 --> 20:42.667
It's a fake!

20:42.733 --> 20:44.167
It's all a fake!

20:44.233 --> 20:45.967
I'm not a minister!

20:46.033 --> 20:47.667
Dale used
a self-playing piano!

20:47.733 --> 20:49.033
It's all a great...

20:49.100 --> 20:51.500
It's a great big fake,
is what it is!

20:53.567 --> 20:55.833
That sure was some
good parenting.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.833
I don't think the experts
would disagree.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.967
( knocking )

20:59.033 --> 21:00.633
mr. Dauterive says

21:00.700 --> 21:03.567
bobby and I aren't
really married!

21:03.633 --> 21:06.567
I'm still keeping those
place mats he gave us.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.167
Place mats?
that's it?

21:08.233 --> 21:10.733
Well, he's one
of your best friends.

21:13.567 --> 21:14.900
You want some milk
with that?

21:14.967 --> 21:16.533
I do.

21:16.600 --> 21:20.400
( both laughing )

21:20.467 --> 21:23.600
i'm glad we're not married
anymore.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.067
But you know what?

21:25.133 --> 21:27.500
I could do a whole lot worse.

21:27.567 --> 21:29.867
I'm sorry for
the pranks, luanne.

21:29.933 --> 21:32.067
And you probably
shouldn't open

21:32.133 --> 21:34.300
your laundry hamper
very quickly

21:34.367 --> 21:35.733
unless you like snakes.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.067
Thank you.

21:37.133 --> 21:39.600
Oh, you might not want
to ride downhill

21:39.667 --> 21:41.067
on your bike.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.533
Something might be
wrong with the brake cable.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.767
Bobby:
oh, don't use your mouthwash

21:45.833 --> 21:47.867
around an open flame,
all right?

21:47.933 --> 21:49.500
Luanne:
I'll try not to.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.300
Oh, um, you might want to stop
drinking that milk.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.300
( bobby choking )

22:26.500 --> 22:29.100
bobby:
I don't think
I'm ready for this yet.
