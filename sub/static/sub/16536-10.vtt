WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.961
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.087 --> 00:05.256
America's favorite
vice presidential candidate

00:05.381 --> 00:08.050
and the CIA's most wanted mercenary
know each other.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.469
I'm working a lead that could prove
damning to Peter MacLeish.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.305
Congresswoman Hookstraten
just called for an extended recess.

00:13.431 --> 00:14.932
She's delaying MacLeish's hearing.

00:15.057 --> 00:18.769
Someone inside the U.S. government
handed over the blueprints to Majid Nassar

00:18.894 --> 00:19.979
for the Capitol bombing.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.313
There's a traitor among us.

00:21.439 --> 00:24.316
Special Agent Hannah Wells
seemed to be a bit obsessed with me.

00:24.442 --> 00:27.820
I just hope she isn't trying to convince
the speaker of any conspiracy theory.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.405
I found the evidence I was looking for.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.906
<i>I'll explain everything when I get there.</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:51.302
My God, are you okay?
Can you hear me?

00:53.429 --> 00:56.307
Look, you've been in an accident,
but help is on the way.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.108
Just try and sit still, okay?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.568
And don't move your neck.

01:09.445 --> 01:10.946
You're gonna be fine.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.906
Madam Speaker,
I know you're waiting for someone,

01:54.031 --> 01:55.991
but the entire country is waiting for us.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.661
We can't delay this vote any longer.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.704
Peter MacLeish is a hero.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.749
Who my witness claims
to have damning evidence against.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.794
We owe it to our constituents
to find out what that is.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.051
Damn it. Pick up.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.735
It's me.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.696
I lost her.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.878
Aah!

03:10.274 --> 03:11.400
Tom, what is this?

03:11.942 --> 03:13.319
It's a blueprint.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.778
A blueprint?

03:15.404 --> 03:17.281
A guide for how to blow up
the Capitol building.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.576
- Where did it come from?
- Us.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.995
The Department of Defense.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.081
Apparently after 9/11,
the Pentagon did a threat assessment

03:26.207 --> 03:27.791
on all key government buildings

03:28.375 --> 03:30.586
to show us where our weaknesses were.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.297
A-And so you're thinking what?

03:35.758 --> 03:37.760
I think someone
inside our government

03:37.885 --> 03:40.429
gave that blueprint to Al-Sakar
to blow up the Capitol.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.432
Who else knows about this?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.975
Just you and Mike.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.271
Tom, you need to call in someone
from Homeland Security or the FBI.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.775
No, no, we can't call anyone
until we know exactly what this is.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.778
You're scaring me right now.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.280
You remember the first night
we were here in the Rose Garden?

03:58.405 --> 04:01.283
You asked me if I thought
we were a target. I said I didn't know.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.826
But now...

04:03.786 --> 04:05.537
...I think you need to take the kids

04:05.663 --> 04:07.289
and leave until we know it's safe.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.416
Take them where?
Where's "safe"?

04:10.960 --> 04:13.045
- I don't know.
- But that's my point.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.172
How do we run if we don't know
who we're running from?

04:16.005 --> 04:18.801
Mike's bringing in the man
who wrote the file, Dr. Enright.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.469
Maybe he's got some answers for us.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.431
But until then,
we cannot trust anyone.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.018
Okay, time's up. If you don't join us
inside immediately,

04:28.143 --> 04:30.896
I will tell the public that you blocked
Peter MacLeish's appointment

04:31.021 --> 04:33.190
so you would be next in line
for the presidency.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.612
Reconvene the committee.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.225
Hannah?!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.853
- What happened?
- You can't let them find me.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.229
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

05:12.354 --> 05:13.397
You need help!

05:13.522 --> 05:14.773
Chuck, you can't call anyone.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.609
I have to get you to the hospital.
You need a-a doctor.

05:17.735 --> 05:18.986
You-- Hannah?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.363
Hannah!

05:30.039 --> 05:33.292
<i>Now that the House Judiciary Committee
has given the nominee the green light,</i>

05:33.417 --> 05:35.627
<i>the full House will convene
for a late-night vote</i>

05:35.753 --> 05:37.629
<i>that many expect
will make Peter MacLeish</i>

05:37.755 --> 05:40.090
<i>the next Vice President
of the United States.</i>

05:40.215 --> 05:42.801
Congratulations. We did it.

05:42.926 --> 05:43.969
Ooh. To Peter MacLeish.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.096
- To the new Vice President.
- Hear, hear.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.768
What's up, Spring Break?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.436
Oh, come on.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.772
You know, if you had
60 news-hungry journalists

05:54.897 --> 05:57.983
clamoring for information about
Nassar's murder, you'd be thirsty, too.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.235
Eh, maybe the MacLeish confirmation
will keep them

06:00.361 --> 06:02.112
off your back for a news cycle.
Yeah.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.282
The only thing that's gonna
keep them off my back is an answer,

06:05.407 --> 06:08.327
- which, as I remind you, we don't have.
- Yeah.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.996
Rumor is MacLeish is bringing a bunch
of his House staffers with him.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.164
You guys know any of them?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.833
Yeah, I used to play soccer every
Tuesday night with his Coms director.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.168
That guy's sharp as a marble.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.630
I once shared a summer house in Dewey
Beach with his legislative assistants.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.549
I mean, we were only 19,
but they seemed on top of it.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.009
19?

06:24.134 --> 06:28.013
Yes, and I will need plenty more of these
before you get any of those stories.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.018
All right, I'm gonna go meet
the speech writers on New Street.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.271
- You guys are welcome to join.
- Nah, we're good where we are, Seth.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.191
- Thank you.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.610
- Have a good night.
- Get home safe.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.946
<i>...will be his wife, Beth,
and their two daughters.</i>

06:44.071 --> 06:46.240
Can you believe
everything that's happened?

06:46.782 --> 06:48.575
It's been a roller coaster, for sure.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.831
You know, I have to admit,
when I first got here,

06:53.956 --> 06:57.042
I thought that you were gonna
do everything you could

06:57.167 --> 07:01.630
to get me out of the White House,
not be the reason I'm still here.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.551
Well, I have to admit,
when <i>you</i> first got here,

07:05.676 --> 07:07.344
I didn't think you could handle it.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.138
Yeah, you called me a minor leaguer.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.599
Yeah, well, I was wrong.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.353
Yeah, if anything, I'm learning from you.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.373
Mr. President, Dr. Alan Enright.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.042
Dr. Enright, please.

07:43.964 --> 07:48.218
I need you to verify for me
that this is your work.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.306
I think you know that it is.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.684
I think that's why I'm here,
Mr. President,

07:55.809 --> 07:58.228
but I had nothing to do
with what happened at the Capitol.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.399
I wrote this file to prevent
what happened, not to cause it.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.110
Even if that's true, you had to realize
that someone used your work

08:05.235 --> 08:08.572
to plan and carry out the bombing.
They followed it to the letter.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.200
Why didn't you come forward?

08:13.202 --> 08:16.705
I close my eyes,
I can see the building fall.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.583
The cast iron melting,
the marble crumble.

08:20.918 --> 08:26.256
Whoever did this, we're talking about
a conspiracy of unparalleled proportions.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.594
I was scared, Mr. President.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.222
Okay.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.517
Okay.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.645
Doctor, I'm gonna need you to give me

08:39.770 --> 08:42.231
every single name
that had access to this file.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.901
I put an ORCON classification
on this file,

08:46.360 --> 08:50.322
which means the number of people
who saw it is limited.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.325
And then I sent it
to the DOD security team.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.993
They all died in the Capitol.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.454
I also sent it to the head of NORCOM.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.706
You sent the file to General Grady?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.336
I wrote this file
two years and six months ago.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.589
General Grady was not
the head of NORCOM then.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.924
Who was?

09:10.592 --> 09:11.802
The general you fired.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.471
Harris Cochrane.

09:22.563 --> 09:26.108
<i>...met MacLeish properly
with the House Judiciary Committee.</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:28.860
<i>Peter MacLeish has been named
the Miracle on the Potomac,</i>

09:28.986 --> 09:32.281
<i>and this return to the capital

09:32.406 --> 09:34.032
<i>the public's association with...</i>

09:37.160 --> 09:40.163

09:46.003 --> 09:48.046
<i>Meanwhile, organizers are working
double time to prepare for--</i>

09:49.965 --> 09:51.592
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.677
Uh, hey.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.971
You okay? How you feeling?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.724
Better. Yeah, thanks to you.

09:58.849 --> 09:59.933
Easy.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.645
Hey, Chuck.
Did you glue my wound?

10:03.770 --> 10:04.938
Yeah.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.941
- Where did you learn to do that?
- YouTube.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.195
House confirmed him.
They're swearing him in this afternoon.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.031
<i>Peter MacLeish's confirmation</i>

10:14.156 --> 10:16.491
<i>received no opposition
from the newly appointed...</i>

10:16.617 --> 10:19.244
Whoever made sure MacLeish survived
wanted him as VP for a reason,

10:19.369 --> 10:21.872
so we have less than eight hours
to make sure that doesn't happen.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.000
Okay, look, I know this isn't
what you're gonna want to hear, but...

10:25.959 --> 10:27.002
Someone tried to kill you,

10:27.127 --> 10:30.547
Atwood's in prison,
Foerstel has me on suspension.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.384
- Maybe it's time we--
- What?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.554
- Quit?
- Hannah.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.601
You almost died last night.

10:42.726 --> 10:46.021
I literally had to scrub
your blood off of my hands.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.066
What else do they need to do to us?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.072
Chuck, why did you join the FBI?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.576
To help people.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.913
I joined to piss my father off.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.042
He's a top surgeon in Chicago,

11:07.167 --> 11:09.252
and he wanted me
to follow in his footsteps.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.963
Practically held me at gunpoint

11:12.089 --> 11:13.715
and took me to Johns Hopkins.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.551
So I went.

11:16.677 --> 11:20.222
And, uh, halfway through grad school,
I walked out, jumped on a train,

11:20.347 --> 11:23.600
went to D.C., and signed up for the FBI.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.769
I wanted to help, too.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.938
I just wanted to do it in my own way.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.568
It's not their job to stop.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.696
It's our job to stop them.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.282
And I'm scared, too.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.452
But if we quit, they win, and then...

11:43.120 --> 11:45.539
everyone who lost someone that day...

11:47.457 --> 11:49.292
they'll never know peace.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.879
Nice try.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.424
You've never been scared in your life.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.971
Fine. I'm in. What's the next step?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.973
- Get back in touch with Hookstraten?
- No.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.184
I told her I had evidence on MacLeish,
and someone tries to kill me.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.310
Right.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.479
And they took all my evidence.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.484
The evidence I got from the woman
who's been calling me.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.696
No, I already told you I can't trace
the call from her again,

12:17.821 --> 12:20.157
and even if I could,
I'm shut out of my office.

12:20.282 --> 12:23.326
Then you'd better get creative
'cause it's the only lead we got.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.292
- Did anyone see you bring him in?
- No, sir.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.669
I kept him off Waves and brought him
in through the East Wing.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.379
It was still early,
so it wasn't a problem.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.797
Okay, good.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.174
Thank you, Mike.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.726
It's different in here when it's quiet.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.144
On the contrary.

12:49.686 --> 12:53.148
This is what this room is usually like.
More calm than storm.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.109
General, I need you to look at this.
Mike?

13:06.703 --> 13:09.414
This looks like a re-enactment
of the Capitol bombing.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.376
Well, it's not.
General, this is file 12-80C,

13:13.502 --> 13:16.004
a threat assessment
created by the Pentagon

13:16.129 --> 13:18.381
two and a half years <i>before</i> the bombing.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.430
Mr. President,
I have never seen this before.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.516
I find that highly unlikely.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.352
This file was given
an ORCON classification.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.480
I can count on my hand
the number of people that have seen it.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.235
Your name is the only one on the list
that survived the bombing.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.616
This was sent to me, but I never had
the opportunity to read it.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.078
That file was reclassified
by the Secretary of Defense

13:48.203 --> 13:51.039
and recalled electronically from
my computer before I could access it.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.125
And you expect me to believe
that you just remembered that?

13:54.251 --> 13:57.212
A file taken from my hand
by the Secretary of Defense

13:57.337 --> 13:58.713
at a moment's notice?

13:58.839 --> 14:02.300
A lieutenant general being told
he's not cleared to read something?

14:02.425 --> 14:04.302
Never happened before, not to me.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.389
What would be the circumstances
that would cause the Secretary of Defense

14:07.514 --> 14:09.641
- to reclassify a document like that?
- I don't know,

14:09.766 --> 14:11.810
but it's not something
he could do unilaterally.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.353
He must've been given orders.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.272
By who?

14:16.231 --> 14:18.400
There's a chain of command.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.736
Only one place the Sec Def
gets his orders from.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.613
The White House.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.326
General, you'll be detained

14:28.451 --> 14:30.370
- until we can verify your story.
- I understand.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.206
Mr. President.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.792
You have a serious problem.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.462
And while you may not ask for my help,

14:39.796 --> 14:41.631
it's here if you want it, sir.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.472
- Hey, Emily.
- Hey.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.266
So, I was thinking,
now that MacLeish is confirmed,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.351
we should start scheduling committee
hearings right away to push

14:53.476 --> 14:55.645
- the president's cabinet nominees through.
- That's a great idea.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.689
We should get some Leg Affairs folks
to start prepping.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.940
I'll get on it.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.026
Hey, listen. About last night...

15:01.151 --> 15:04.154
You mean when you kissed me?
You don't have to be weird about it.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.281
Well, what if I want to be weird about it?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.785
Anyway, there's an Elvis impersonator
later tonight at the Nine Thirty club.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.288
- You want to go?
- How did you know I like Elvis?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.665
Well, opposition research
comes in handy sometimes.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.500
Seth told you?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.085
Seth told me.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.504
I'm in.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.132
All right.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.636
The president wants to see me.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.387
I didn't get a message.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.848
Well, then it can't be
anything too important.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.016
Yeah.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.147
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay in this room.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.232
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

15:41.358 --> 15:45.195
Yesterday I received
a highly classified DOD file

15:45.320 --> 15:46.863
detailing how to blow up the Capitol.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.367
I believe it's what Al-Sakar used
to plan and carry out the attack.

15:50.492 --> 15:54.579
I also think the file was given to them
by someone in Richmond's administration.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.706
That's why I had to bring you in on this.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.000
Not only do I trust you implicitly,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.169
you weren't here when the file
was being circulated.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.462
Who was?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.299
This is what I managed
to put together so far.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.681
- Aaron's on this list.
- I know.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.265
I had to put down everyone's name

16:14.391 --> 16:15.892
who had security clearance
that would allow them

16:16.017 --> 16:18.061
to know the file even existed.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.022
Emily, I think there's a traitor
in the White House,

16:21.147 --> 16:23.525
and I need you to help me
find out who it is.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.243
Yeah, Shelly.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.287
Nassar's been dead for six days.
When can we expect an answer?

16:36.413 --> 16:39.040
As I said before, Shelly, I still don't
have any information about this.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.126
Come on, guys, who's gonna ask me
about the swearing-in ceremony?

16:42.585 --> 16:43.586
Natalie.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.798
About the decision to hold
the swearing-in at the Capitol site,

16:46.923 --> 16:48.299
how exactly was that reached?

16:48.425 --> 16:49.592
Thank you, Natalie.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.804
So, since Thomas Jefferson's
inauguration in 1800,

16:52.929 --> 16:55.056
swearing-in ceremonies
have been held at the Capitol,

16:55.181 --> 16:58.393
and the president felt it was both
symbolic and necessary

16:58.518 --> 16:59.811
to continue with that tradition,
all right?

16:59.936 --> 17:03.398
That's all I have right now. I'll call you
back in a few hours. Thank you.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.905
Have OP send us an updated list of
who they've invited to the swearing-in.

17:11.031 --> 17:11.948
Seth.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.659
- A word?
- Thanks, guys. I'll catch up to you.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.868
Lisa. Hey.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.079
- You didn't call on me once.
- Oh, sorry. I didn't see you.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.250
I couldn't have been more clear
if I had one of those light sticks

17:22.375 --> 17:24.252
they use to direct airplanes.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.212
Now, if this is about you...

17:26.628 --> 17:28.840
holding a grudge
about the Leo Kirkman story--

17:28.965 --> 17:30.175
Look, there's limited time.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.342
I can't get to everyone's question,

17:31.468 --> 17:33.762
but if you have something that's
pressing, you can always send me

17:33.887 --> 17:35.972
an e-mail or reach out
to deputies in my office.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.183
Seth. Okay, I get it.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.392
I betrayed your trust.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.394
And I'm sorry.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.066
But it's my job to ask questions
and your job to answer them.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.277
The president can forgive me.
Why can't you?

18:02.332 --> 18:03.374
Emily.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.001
Hey. I was looking all over for you.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.796
I thought you were gonna sit in on that
legislative affairs meeting with me.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.256
Oh, sorry. I got tied up.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.219
So what did the president
want to see you about?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.888
Nothing. Uh, he just...
he wanted me to take another look

18:17.013 --> 18:19.140
at Bruce Rangell for HUD Secretary.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.684
- That one's obviously important for him.
- Yeah.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.480
Hey, so, tonight, pick you up here, 8:45?

18:25.855 --> 18:26.940
Um...

18:27.482 --> 18:29.234
Look, I think I'm gonna be
pretty swamped here,

18:29.359 --> 18:31.486
so I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.031
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. All right. Rain check.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.869
Emily, listen, you don't...
you don't regret last night, do you?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.288
No, I just can't do it tonight.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.707
Okay.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.757
Okay, signaling system 7, SS-7.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.384
Lets every cellphone tower
talk to each other

18:54.509 --> 18:56.010
so your phone works
anywhere in the world.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.595
How does that help us?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.765
If I can get in, we can connect the dots
from your cell

19:00.890 --> 19:02.934
back to the one that mystery woman
called you from.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.065
Got it. I'm in.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.776
- Good job, Chuck.
- Don't thank me yet.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.028
I still got to backtrack the number
that called your cell.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.699
- Damn it.
- What?

19:17.824 --> 19:21.619
Network picked up the intrusion.
It's a race to see what happens first.

19:21.744 --> 19:25.582
I track your mystery caller's phone,
or they track us.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.042
Come on. Come on.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.089
Got it.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.302
Looks like the call to your cell
came from a burner phone.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.511
Purchased from where?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.766
A convenience store in Dupont Circle.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.981
- Speaker Hookstraten's here, sir.
- Thank you, Wyatt.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.649
You wanted to speak with me,
Mr. President?

19:51.774 --> 19:53.276
Yes, Madam Speaker.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.613
I was told that you had information
on Congressman MacLeish

19:56.738 --> 19:58.615
that you wanted to share
with the committee.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.702
I'm sorry, but I need to know
what that was.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.957
Six weeks ago,
an FBI agent approached me.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.003
She wanted access to the blueprints
of the Capitol.

20:12.128 --> 20:16.466
Yesterday, she told me she had evidence
against Peter MacLeish.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.426
And then she never showed up.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.928
She-- What was the agent's name?

20:20.053 --> 20:21.262
Hannah Wells.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.805
Hannah Wells.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.975
Congressman MacLeish told me...

20:26.392 --> 20:28.144
What did he say, exactly?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.773
He thought that
she was obsessed with him,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.484
that her investigation
had somehow turned personal.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.778
Did she come across that way to you?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.113
No, sir, not at all.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.949
Do you know where she is now?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.409
Well, strangely,
I haven't heard from her since.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Okay, thank you.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.165
Kimble...

20:49.624 --> 20:51.834
why did she want the blueprints
for the Capitol Building?

20:51.960 --> 20:55.088
She requested them as part
of the investigation into the bombing.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.674
Right.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.050
Of course, right.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.510
Thank you.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.971
Is everything all right, sir?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.184
I'm not sure yet.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.187
I'll let you know as soon as I can.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.070
Then your detail will bring you back
to One Observatory Circle.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.239
Home, sweet home.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.074
I'm sorry for the interruption.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.158
- Mr. President.
- Not at all.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.327
We're just going through
some of the final details.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.912
It's gonna be a great event, Peter.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.790
- Mike, can I borrow you for a second?
- Excuse me.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.381
I need to speak with an FBI agent
named Hannah Wells.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.925
- Can you find her for me?
- Yes, sir.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.218
Thank you.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.030
Hannah Wells?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.532
Why does the president want
to know about Hannah Wells?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.577
He's interested in some information
she claims to have on Peter MacLeish.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.580
Why? What kind of information
did she say she had?

22:10.705 --> 22:13.458
She didn't. That's, um--

22:13.583 --> 22:15.168
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.503
Do you know where I could find her?

22:18.338 --> 22:20.256
I wish I did.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.761
She totalled her car yesterday
at 15th and "K" and fled the scene.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.639
I've checked every local hospital,
even tried pinging her phone.

22:28.765 --> 22:32.268
You're saying an FBI agent
just up and disappeared?

22:32.602 --> 22:33.603
Yes.

22:33.728 --> 22:37.398
I mean, who knows what kind of mess
Jason Atwood's got her mixed up in,

22:37.523 --> 22:41.069
but you want to know more
about Agent Wells?

22:41.736 --> 22:44.280
Here's her file. See for yourself.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.116
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.081
Hi. I'm Agent Wells.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.666
I called earlier about looking
at your surveillance footage.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.002
Yes, of course. Uh, it's in the back.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.504
Bob, can you take the register?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.381
- No problem.
- Right this way.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.093
- Thanks for doing this.
- Yeah.

23:05.218 --> 23:09.597
Can you pull up some footage
from January 26th, around 3:32 p.m.?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.641
That's when the phone was initiated.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.563
Stop.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.860
Do you have any exterior cameras?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.654
Yeah, in the parking lot.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.531
Okay, I need you to pull that up.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.036
Freeze.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.246
And zoom in.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.546
<i>This is Chuck.</i>

23:41.671 --> 23:43.840
Hey, Chuck, I need you
to run a plate for me.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.510
<i>At the swearing-in,
the invocation will be delivered</i>

23:47.635 --> 23:49.137
by a Colonel William Sizemore.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.888
He was the congressman's
Army pastor,

23:51.013 --> 23:53.141
and he'll be sworn in
using Beth MacLeish's Bible,

23:53.266 --> 23:55.893
which is being brought in
from the family home in Oregon.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.313
- Yeah, Lisa.
- Thank you.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.899
I've just learned from a source
that a suspect is in custody

24:02.024 --> 24:03.568
in connection with
the murder of Majid Nassar.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.236
What is the White House's response

24:05.361 --> 24:08.406
and when can we expect to learn more
about the suspect's identity.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.907
Lisa, let me interrupt you right there,

24:10.032 --> 24:12.243
as it would be inappropriate
for the White House to comment

24:12.368 --> 24:14.078
on an ongoing investigation.
Now, that being said,

24:14.203 --> 24:15.830
this is obviously a matter
of extreme importance--

24:15.955 --> 24:18.082
How long
has the White House known?

24:18.207 --> 24:20.710
- Are you worried about the public's...
- What else is the White House hiding?

24:20.835 --> 24:23.588
I would direct any remaining questions
you have

24:23.713 --> 24:26.674
to the Army criminal investigators, okay?
That's all I have for right now, guys.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.759
I'll see you at the Capitol
for the swearing-in.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.511
You can't just walk away from this.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.055
We deserve answers.
The public deserves answers!

24:34.056 --> 24:36.267
Don't get many West Wingers here,

24:36.392 --> 24:38.519
especially senior aides to POTUS.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.771
It's a special assignment.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.107
Now, all phone calls from the White House
are catalogued, correct?

24:43.232 --> 24:45.193
Yes, ma'am, every letter, call,
correspondence,

24:45.318 --> 24:46.861
all preserved for history.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.362
Perfect.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.699
I'm trying to find who, from the White
House, contacted the Secretary of Defense

24:51.824 --> 24:56.996
on June 23rd, 2015,
between 8:00 and 8:33 a.m.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.832
Shouldn't be a problem.
Just give me a sec.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.423
Here you go.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.885
There was a call logged to the Office
of the Secretary of Defense.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.971
8:23 a.m., 23, June 2015.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.723
Who made the call?

25:17.099 --> 25:18.935
White House Chief of Staff
Charles Langdon.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.981
Do we have an update
on Agent Wells?

25:24.106 --> 25:26.484
She was in a car accident
yesterday at 15th and "K."

25:26.609 --> 25:28.986
And according to witnesses,
she abandoned the scene.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.947
FBI hasn't been able to track her down.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.157
Wait a second.
She was in a car accident

25:33.282 --> 25:36.661
on her way to provide information
on Congressman MacLeish?

25:36.786 --> 25:38.412
That's a bit of a coincidence.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.915
Director Foerstel
gave me a look at her file.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.583
Merits of accommodation aside,

25:42.708 --> 25:44.961
Agent Wells has been going
through a difficult time.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.504
According to Atwood's own notes,

25:46.629 --> 25:48.256
he felt her judgment
might be compromised.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.966
- Why?
- She was in a relationship

25:50.091 --> 25:52.843
with someone that died at the Capitol,
Senator Scott Wheeler.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.845
All I know is that
she went to Hookstraten

25:54.971 --> 25:56.681
looking for the blueprints
for the Capitol Building

25:56.806 --> 25:58.808
weeks before we knew about the file,

25:58.933 --> 26:02.270
so she's either crazy, like everybody says
or she knows something.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.689
We got to keep looking for her.

26:04.814 --> 26:05.982
Yes, sir.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.500
FBI! Stop right there!

27:48.417 --> 27:49.502
Turn around.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.420
Turn around.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.051
I know you.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.304
You're Charles Langdon.
You were Richmond's Chief of Staff.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.473
- Everyone thinks you're dead.
- You've got to get out of here.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.934
- They could have followed you.
- You're the one calling me about MacLeish?

28:05.059 --> 28:07.395
You don't know how hard it is
to stay hidden from them.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.563
- It was a woman's voice.
- They'll never stop searching for me.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.608
Who's "they"? Who is behind this?
Why do they keep MacLeish alive?

28:12.733 --> 28:14.402
It's-- It's bigger than you think.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.653
Don't trust anyone.

28:15.778 --> 28:16.821
Get down!

28:24.078 --> 28:25.079
Ah!

28:28.791 --> 28:29.709
Aah!

28:33.754 --> 28:34.797
Oh!

29:05.661 --> 29:06.829
This is Russink.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.665
<i>Hey, Chuck.
I got a security key card here</i>

29:09.790 --> 29:12.084
with a logo on it.
An "M" with a circle around it.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.128
"M"? Um...

29:14.587 --> 29:16.380
Could be Metway Security
out of Virginia,

29:16.505 --> 29:18.549
super high-end private security
and monitoring firm.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.384
<i>They offer me a job every year or two.</i>

29:20.509 --> 29:22.219
I'll give you
the serial number on the back.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.221
Run it for me. See what this unlocks.
You ready?

29:24.346 --> 29:28.142
<i>- Yeah, shoot.</i>
- Zulu-Tango-3-2-6-7-Echo.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.395
<i>Hannah?</i>

29:31.520 --> 29:32.688
Hannah, you still there?

29:32.813 --> 29:34.356
Call me when you got something.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.241
All right, so this reporter, Lisa Jordan,
she knows we have someone in custody.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.826
She just doesn't know that it's Atwood?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.244
That's right. She knows
we've arrested someone.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.413
- She just doesn't know who it is.
- Then, she has nothing.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.414
She knows we're hiding something.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.666
Mr. President, we agreed
not to tell the press anything

29:52.792 --> 29:54.043
until we have all the facts.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.587
Well, we have them now.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.547
The FBI just handed in their report,

29:58.672 --> 30:00.508
and it concludes that Jason Atwood

30:00.633 --> 30:03.260
did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.179
That's incredible.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.765
I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on
as a White House correspondent

30:07.890 --> 30:08.891
to keep us honest.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.186
She kept up her end of the bargain.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.604
We need to do the same.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.690
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive
on the man that we have in custody,

30:16.816 --> 30:18.692
but she's gonna have
to wait till tomorrow.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.027
Yes, sir.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.907
Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.451
I know you didn't want it to be true.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.203
None of us did.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.960
Oh, sir, I was thinking if, uh...
if you're having second thoughts

30:36.085 --> 30:37.711
on Bruce Rangell
for Secretary of Housing,

30:37.837 --> 30:40.714
I could always pull up more information
on him to look over.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.008
I'm not having second thoughts
on Rangell.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.718
What would make you think that?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.473
I'm sorry. I-I must have been, um--

30:49.598 --> 30:51.809
I must have been thinking
about something else.

30:51.934 --> 30:54.728
The motorcade leaves
for the Capitol in 30 minutes.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.605
- Thank you, Aaron.
- Sir.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.234
Ritter.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.152
<i>Agent Ritter,
it's John Foerstel.</i>

31:02.278 --> 31:03.404
What can I do for you?

31:03.529 --> 31:06.657
<i>You asked me to keep the White House
in the loop on Hannah Wells.</i>

31:06.782 --> 31:09.618
<i>I just got a disturbing phone call
out of Virginia.</i>

31:10.369 --> 31:14.456
- Agent Wells shot someone?
- Yes, sir, at a farm in Fredericksburg.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.836
The FBI's still working to identify
the body, but witnesses claim

31:18.961 --> 31:20.254
they saw someone fitting
Agent Wells' description

31:20.379 --> 31:22.506
engaged in a shootout
before fleeing the scene.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.133
What the hell is going on?

31:24.258 --> 31:25.968
The Feds are throwing a net over D.C.,

31:26.093 --> 31:28.846
and their EOC is monitoring
every camera and feed

31:28.971 --> 31:30.472
within a 30-mile radius.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.059
I'll make sure our people
are on the lookout for her, as well.

31:34.435 --> 31:37.271
- What, you think she's a threat?
- I don't know, sir.

31:37.396 --> 31:41.483
But I can't logically explain her actions
over the past 24 hours.

31:42.151 --> 31:44.862
We should consider
that both MacLeish and Foerstel

31:44.987 --> 31:46.947
might be right about her.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.700
And I'd rather we overreact and be wrong

31:49.825 --> 31:51.994
than underestimate her
and live to regret it.

31:53.162 --> 31:54.663
Okay, thanks, Mike.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.550
- Hey, Chuck.
- I've been monitoring police scanners.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.969
Metro Police, the Bureau,
they're all looking for you.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.013
I don't know how much longer
I can help you.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.182
Look, I understand.
Were you able to find out

32:13.307 --> 32:15.017
- anything about the key card?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

32:15.142 --> 32:18.312
It gives you access
to room 7 on the 8th floor

32:18.437 --> 32:21.857
- of the PLC Building on Louisiana.
<i>- Louisiana?</i>

32:22.691 --> 32:25.069
Chuck, room 7,
does it face east or west?

32:28.530 --> 32:31.200
- East. Why?
<i>- You can see the steps.</i>

32:31.325 --> 32:32.576
Hannah, what are you thinking?

32:32.701 --> 32:36.288
Proximity to the Capitol,
direct line of sight to the platform.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.000
Chuck, they're gonna kill Kirkman.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.239
It'll be okay.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.449
I just wish we had more time
to figure everything out

33:12.574 --> 33:14.201
before we did something
so permanent.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.621
Tom, if you feel that way,
then we should not go through with this.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.457
We don't have a choice. The only evidence
we have is circumstantial.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.126
We could be wrong.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.420
The country can't afford
another setback.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.430
Peter.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.766
Everyone's waiting.
It's time to leave.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.103
What's wrong?

33:41.228 --> 33:43.772
We were supposed to be
in the car 10 minutes ago.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.901
I don't know
if I can go through with this.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.613
- Honey, of course you can.
- No.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.951
I think we need
to rethink this thing.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.829
It is perfectly normal
to have cold feet,

33:58.954 --> 34:01.582
but this is a great day
for all of us.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.418
It is exactly
what we've been working for.

34:04.877 --> 34:05.961
Yeah.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.257
But at what cost?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.969
At any cost necessary.

34:15.137 --> 34:19.141
Peter, you were chosen
to survive for a reason.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.518
You've been given
a tremendous responsibility

34:22.643 --> 34:24.605
to restore this nation

34:24.730 --> 34:28.108
to the empire it once was
and can be again.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.114
Our friends placed their faith in you.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.284
What would they think
if they saw you like this?

34:38.452 --> 34:40.120
You are on the cusp, Peter.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.831
This isn't the time for weakness.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.667
Now tell me you agree.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.839
Tell me you agree, Peter.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.469
Okay.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.305
Good.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.684
Now let's go.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.368
Lisa.

35:19.493 --> 35:20.702
Excuse me, Cody.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.289
Hey. I took your question
to the president.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.083
Let me guess, no comment.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.377
If it was up to me, honestly,
yeah, no comment.

35:28.502 --> 35:31.338
We've been way too reactive around here,
and that's gonna change,

35:31.463 --> 35:33.924
but the president appreciates you,
and we've decided to grant you

35:34.049 --> 35:35.551
the exclusive
on the Nassar investigation.

35:37.553 --> 35:38.428
Really?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.389
- When?
- Soon.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.142
For now, let's let America celebrate.
I'll be in touch.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.678
8th floor, all clear.

36:47.581 --> 36:48.790
Clear.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.630
President Kirkman!

37:34.670 --> 37:36.338
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

37:36.463 --> 37:38.131
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

37:46.431 --> 37:48.308
I wanted to take a moment
before we get started

37:48.433 --> 37:50.811
and congratulate you
on becoming vice president.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.523
Our country's got a long road to
recovery, but this is another big step.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.692
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.

37:58.986 --> 38:00.070
Emily Rhodes.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.572
Ms. Rhodes,
it's Amanda at the switchboard.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.658
- Yes.
<i>- You asked me to look deeper</i>

38:04.783 --> 38:07.244
into Charles Langdon's phone records,

38:07.369 --> 38:11.039
<i>June 23. Uh, as it turns out,</i>

38:11.164 --> 38:13.250
he wasn't in his office that day.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.336
- I'm sorry?
<i>- I double-checked his schedule.</i>

38:16.461 --> 38:20.090
Uh, Mr. Langdon was
on an overseas trip to Geneva.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.050
<i>Then who made the call
to the Pentagon?</i>

38:22.843 --> 38:24.553
His deputy, Aaron Shore.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.476
Thank you.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.566
Mr. President, it's time.

38:43.697 --> 38:47.909
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated.</i>

38:52.539 --> 38:54.875
Good afternoon.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.128
When I see how many of you
have chosen to brave the elements

38:58.253 --> 39:00.130
to mark this momentous occasion,

39:00.255 --> 39:02.799
I can only tell you
how inspired I am.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.635
<i>Today, I stand...</i>

39:05.761 --> 39:07.804
<i>...on the site of one
of America's greatest tragedies</i>

39:07.929 --> 39:11.641
and offer the promise
of America's rebirth.

39:11.767 --> 39:14.811
The night I was sworn in
as President of the United States,

39:14.936 --> 39:16.646
this nation,

39:16.772 --> 39:18.648
<i>our nation,</i>

39:18.774 --> 39:20.275
<i>was in the grips of chaos.</i>

39:20.400 --> 39:23.945
<i>But now, as I look out on the Mall,</i>

39:24.071 --> 39:26.323
<i>I don't see a people that were scared.</i>

39:26.448 --> 39:29.326
<i>I don't see a people
that were frightened.</i>

39:29.451 --> 39:30.994
- Excuse me.
<i>- I see that we are strong...</i>

39:31.119 --> 39:32.120
Excuse me.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.289
...and that we are proud

39:35.123 --> 39:37.292
and that we are, once again, united.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.295
God bless all of you

39:40.420 --> 39:43.048
and these United States of America.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.677
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my profound honor to introduce

39:47.803 --> 39:51.306
Congressman Peter MacLeish,
our next vice president.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.558
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.852
<i>Congressman MacLeish,</i>

39:55.977 --> 39:58.271
<i>if you'll place your hand on the Bible
and repeat after me.</i>

39:59.731 --> 40:00.857
"I, Peter Lewis MacLeish..."

40:00.982 --> 40:02.609
I, Peter Lewis MacLeish...

40:02.734 --> 40:04.820
<i>"...do solemnly swear
to support and defend</i>

40:04.945 --> 40:06.446
the Constitution of the United States..."

40:06.571 --> 40:08.990
<i>...do solemnly swear
to support and defend</i>

40:09.116 --> 40:10.700
<i>the Constitution
of the United States...</i>

40:10.826 --> 40:13.286
"...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic..."

40:13.412 --> 40:15.664
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

40:15.789 --> 40:18.458
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
<i>- "...that I bear true faith...</i>

40:18.583 --> 40:21.378
...that I bear true faith
and allegiance to the same...

40:21.503 --> 40:24.005
- Excuse me. Move!
<i>- "...that I take this obligation freely,</i>

40:24.131 --> 40:27.717
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion."

40:27.843 --> 40:29.886
<i>...and that I take
this obligation freely,</i>

40:30.011 --> 40:32.806
<i>without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion,</i>

40:32.931 --> 40:34.558
and that I will well and faithfully

40:34.683 --> 40:37.394
discharge the duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.396
<i>"So help me God."</i>

40:39.521 --> 40:40.480
<i>So help me God.</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:43.567
I have a suspect in my line of sight.
I need a team.

40:43.692 --> 40:46.153
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.</i>

41:02.210 --> 41:03.044
Gun! Gun!
