00:03.370 --> 00:05.600
The whale's supposed to be
an intelligent animal.

00:05.772 --> 00:09.503
You hear about how they communicate
by song from miles away...

00:09.676 --> 00:11.871
...how extensive their vocabulary is.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.513
From the rate we're pushing
the whales off the beach...

00:14.681 --> 00:18.082
...back into the ocean,
the words "shore" and "close"...

00:18.251 --> 00:20.913
...do not appear to be
in their vocabulary.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.521
I'd say to them,
"Concentrate less on the singing...

00:23.690 --> 00:27.990
...a little more on the approaching
Cuervo beach volleyball tournament...

00:28.595 --> 00:31.928
...if you want to maintain
that brainy-mammal image."

00:36.436 --> 00:39.837
<i>I can't believe this.
What a dope!</i>

00:40.306 --> 00:42.797
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.941
This is...
This is kind of embarrassing...

00:47.113 --> 00:49.604
...but there's no toilet paper
over here.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.814
Are you talking to me?

00:51.985 --> 00:56.149
Yeah. I just forgot to check,
so if you could spare some...

00:56.322 --> 00:58.222
No, I'm sorry.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.386
-What?
-No, I'm sorry. I can't spare it.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.553
-You can't spare it?
-No. There's not enough to spare.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.698
Well, I don't need much.
Just three squares will do it.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.064
I'm sorry, I don't have three squares.
Now, if you don't mind...

01:11.237 --> 01:14.434
Three squares?
You can't spare three squares?

01:14.607 --> 01:17.440
No, I don't have a square to spare.
I can't spare a square!

01:18.044 --> 01:22.174
Well, is it two-ply? Because
if it's two-ply, I'll take one ply.

01:22.415 --> 01:27.079
One ply. One puny little ply.
I'll take one measly ply!

01:27.253 --> 01:30.245
Look, I don't have a square
and I don't have a ply!

01:30.423 --> 01:32.891
No, no, don't go! I beg you!

01:37.630 --> 01:39.291
I love this artificial flavoring.

01:39.732 --> 01:43.498
I like it better than butter.
I think it's more consistent.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.468
You would not believe what just
happened to me in the bathroom.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.163
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.635
-Hey, where's my popcorn, babe?
-What?

01:51.811 --> 01:53.938
My popcorn. You were supposed
to get me popcorn.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.479
Did you forget about me, babe?

01:55.648 --> 01:59.448
You would not believe what just
happened to me in the bathroom.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.578
I mean, a person needs a certain
amount of toilet paper to be covered.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.747
I simply could not spare it.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.689
This woman just didn't get it.
She kept harassing me.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.524
Three squares!
That's all I was asking for.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.222
Three squares!

02:13.399 --> 02:16.698
She wouldn't stop.
"Help me! Help me!"

02:16.870 --> 02:18.997
She was insane.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.037
I was begging her.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.107
"Please, please!"

02:23.276 --> 02:25.107
She was insane.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.139
Who does she think she is?
How dare she?

02:29.315 --> 02:30.839
Do you want me to get
the manager?

02:31.017 --> 02:34.009
Too bad they don't have old ladies
walking around with flashlights.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.486
-Flush her out.
-I don't even know what she looks like.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.751
I wonder where Elaine is sitting.
I really wanted you to meet her.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.155
She's supposed to be here
with her new boyfriend.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.490
I wonder where Jerry's sitting.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.859
He's supposed to be here
with his new girlfriend.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.696
-I'm dying to see what she looks like.
-Hey.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.665
You think if I jumped off
that balcony, I'd get hurt?

03:00.079 --> 03:01.808
-Hey. Hey, guy.
-Hey.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.442
Can I use your phone
in your bedroom?

03:04.617 --> 03:06.608
What's the matter with yours?

03:06.886 --> 03:08.513
My batteries are dead.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.179
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?

03:12.058 --> 03:14.583
Come on. Let me use it.
Five minutes. I'll pay you back.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.922
Why do you do that?

03:19.699 --> 03:22.361
I am never going
to the movies again.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.526
Where were you last night?
I looked for you.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.865
I looked for you too.
I was over on the side.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.941
Oh, with pretty boy Tony.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.373
-Yeah, right. Okay.
-"Hey. Hey." Tony.

03:32.579 --> 03:35.548
-"Hey."
-That's nice. Listen to this.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.741
I am in the bathroom, right,
before the movie starts...

03:38.985 --> 03:42.580
...and I'm in the stall,
and there's no toilet paper.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.619
No what?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.619
Toilet paper.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.027
So...

03:51.064 --> 03:54.192
...I ask this woman in the stall
next to me for some...

03:54.367 --> 03:56.699
...and she refuses!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.394
Well, maybe she couldn't spare it.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.239
-A square?
-Well, you know...

04:05.411 --> 04:07.777
...sometimes a square is everything.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.643
-A ply?
-Elaine, you cannot judge a person...

04:10.817 --> 04:14.913
...in a situation like that. It's like asking
for someone's canteen in the desert.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.648
-It's battle conditions.
-Yeah, well...

04:18.491 --> 04:20.459
...I just hope I run
into her again, okay?

04:20.627 --> 04:25.394
Because I will never forget that
flinty voice. It is tattooed in my brain.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.632
If I hear it, watch out.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.770
So listen, what happened
with Jane last night?

04:32.972 --> 04:35.099
<i>Jane, she... She...</i>

04:35.275 --> 04:37.835
The four of us are going out
Saturday. That should be fun.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.378
Yeah, that should be real fun.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.846
-It's getting late. Can I call Tony?
-Yeah.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.482
<i>Then we'll get a cab
and we'll do it in the back seat.</i>

04:50.890 --> 04:52.653
<i>How's that, Andre?</i>

04:53.092 --> 04:56.220
<i>-Andre?
-What about the driver?</i>

04:57.030 --> 05:00.488
<i>-We'd get in an accident.
-So what?</i>

05:00.700 --> 05:03.260
<i>Well, that wouldn't be very good.</i>

05:04.437 --> 05:06.997
Hey, Andre, get the hell off
the phone!

05:09.776 --> 05:12.870
-What is going on? Who is Andre?
-Kramer's Andre.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.911
He's fooling around
with these 976 numbers.

05:15.081 --> 05:19.245
Hey, I told you, I don't want you
doing that on my phone!

05:19.419 --> 05:22.149
Jerry, I'm telling you,
this phone-sex thing is hilarious.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.846
Like this Erica woman. Here, look.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.888
You gotta call her.
What a voice she uses.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.495
You know, it's weird, because
that voice sounded familiar to me.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.130
-You hungry? Wanna..? Monk's?
-No. I gotta go downtown.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.062
-You're giving me a lift home, right?
-Yeah.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.260
So listen, what happened
last night with Jane?

05:38.438 --> 05:42.374
Oh, nothing.
She just choked on a Jujube.

05:43.876 --> 05:47.835
You know, I hate to tell you this,
but it is time to defrost your freezer.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.505
I know.
I just can't bring myself to do it.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.880
Meanwhile that freezer keeps
getting smaller and smaller.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.749
Don't wanna keep Tony waiting.

05:57.924 --> 06:02.486
-Hey, you got a problem with Tony?
-Hunky Tony. "Hey."

06:02.995 --> 06:06.692
Okay. Jerry, I would be going out with
him no matter what he looked like.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.529
-Of course you would.
-Oh, yeah. Like you're one to talk.

06:10.703 --> 06:11.897
-Elaine...
-What?

06:12.071 --> 06:16.132
...it's different for a man.
We're expected to be superficial.

06:16.342 --> 06:20.779
-I'm not being superficial.
-Elaine, he's a male bimbo.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.245
He's a "mimbo."

06:23.483 --> 06:25.542
He's not a mimbo.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.913
He is an exciting, charismatic man...

06:28.087 --> 06:30.783
...who just happens to have
a perfect face.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.788
And that's why
you're going out with him.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.256
No, it is not.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.918
You know, I think George
has a non-sexual crush on him.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.620
I think he does too.

06:38.798 --> 06:42.427
I mean, every time I see him,
it's Tony this, Tony that.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.832
George is like a schoolgirl
around him.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.701
So I said:

06:47.940 --> 06:49.339
"Hey, dude...

06:49.575 --> 06:51.736
...you better step off."

06:53.279 --> 06:54.871
-Step off?
-Yeah.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.810
You said, "Step off"?

06:59.051 --> 07:01.747
God, that is too much!

07:01.921 --> 07:04.082
Hey, hey, Tony...

07:08.661 --> 07:10.925
...I just had this brainstorm for us.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.429
-Can you guess what it is?
-No.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.358
Bowling.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.798
What do you say? Bowling, huh?

07:17.970 --> 07:20.768
Bowling's insane!
Bowling is crazy time!

07:20.940 --> 07:22.373
Bowling?

07:22.575 --> 07:26.534
I don't think so, George.
You get no rush from bowling.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.237
Rush? You want a rush?

07:29.415 --> 07:32.441
Drop a ball on your toe, my friend!

07:32.652 --> 07:35.143
Talk about a rush,
you'll be throbbing!

07:35.321 --> 07:37.687
-You'll see visions!
-No, no, no.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.381
I'm thinking...

07:39.559 --> 07:40.787
...rock climbing.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.554
All right! Rock climbing!

07:44.764 --> 07:49.224
Just the two of us? All right. All right.
Hey, I'll make some sandwiches.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.461
What do you like?
Tuna, peanut butter?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.902
-Whatever.
-All right. I gotta buy some bread.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.508
You know, I am definitely down
for some rock climbing.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.908
Yeah, me too. I am down.
I am totally down.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.707
Mark me down.

08:02.882 --> 08:06.978
Cool. So, what do you say
we climb a rock mañana?

08:08.855 --> 08:10.288
Mañana.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.887
Mañana might be a problem.
I'm supposed to...

08:15.061 --> 08:17.461
...have a boil lanced mañana...

08:18.898 --> 08:22.664
...and I think they charge me if I cancel
with only one mañana's notice.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.359
-Hey, Kramer!
-Hey, Tony.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.731
-Hey!
-Hey, Georgie.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.533
Kramer, my man,
what are you doing mañana?

08:28.708 --> 08:31.006
<i>Mañana I'm doing nada.</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:33.543
What do you say you scale some rock
with me and George?

08:33.712 --> 08:35.544
Tony, that's gonna be
too many sandwiches.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.182
Come on, Kramer.
What do you say?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.851
Kramer, it's pretty dangerous
up there.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.418
-No, I'm down.
-Yes!

08:41.587 --> 08:44.954
-Yeah! I'll see you.
-All right, buddy. Take it easy, Kramer.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.591
You down, George? What's wrong?

08:46.759 --> 08:49.557
-Oh, no, I am down.
-Yeah!

08:52.999 --> 08:54.990
Rock climbing?

08:55.635 --> 08:57.933
Where do you come off
going rock climbing?

08:58.104 --> 09:00.197
Rock climbing?

09:00.706 --> 09:03.038
You need a boost
to climb into your bed.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.404
All right. All right.

09:05.778 --> 09:08.576
What is it with you and Tony?
What, you're his sidekick now?

09:08.948 --> 09:11.473
Yeah. That's right. I like it.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.551
He's such a cool guy.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.047
"A cool guy"?
What, are you in eighth grade?

09:18.024 --> 09:20.822
He's the first cool guy
I've ever been friends with in my life.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.427
It's a different world
when you're with a cool guy.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.063
He's not afraid of anybody.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.290
You should hear the way
he talks to waitresses.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.263
He gets free pie!

09:30.736 --> 09:31.964
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.072
-Nice move today.
-What?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.071
Horning in on my rock-climbing trip!

09:36.242 --> 09:37.834
It's just supposed to be
me and Tony.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.444
-He asked me.
-You put him on the spot.

09:41.180 --> 09:44.343
You know, I think that
you're in love with him.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.387
What?

09:50.990 --> 09:54.357
-That's ridiculous!
-No, no. I don't think so.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.422
You love him.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.202
You better be careful on
those rocks tomorrow, buddy.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.998
And you're not getting
any sandwiches either!

10:09.508 --> 10:11.772
-You're making sandwiches?
-Hello?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.504
I don't know if there's gonna be
places to eat up there.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.205
-Who?
-Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?

10:17.383 --> 10:18.975
Hates it.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.142
Good thing I asked.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.651
Who is it?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.790
-Well, she says Jane.
-Yeah, so?

10:24.957 --> 10:29.121
Well, that voice, it's very familiar.
Throaty, almost flinty.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.025
-Did you say "flinty"?
-Yeah. Yeah. Flinty.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.839
Hello!

10:42.508 --> 10:44.373
Hello!

10:44.543 --> 10:46.340
Hey, George, you hear that echo?

10:46.846 --> 10:49.474
Oh, God, please get off me!
I don't want to die up here!

10:49.649 --> 10:53.050
Please! Please, please stop moving.
That's all I ask of you.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.383
-Kramer! Kramer!
-Let go! Hey!

10:56.856 --> 11:00.189
George, let go of my leg!
Grab the rock!

11:00.359 --> 11:02.088
-Grab the rock!
-What rock?

11:02.261 --> 11:04.320
The rock in front of you!

11:04.697 --> 11:06.289
Come on, grab it!

11:07.566 --> 11:10.558
You've gotta relax.
Try to yodel. Yodel.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.932
-That's it. That's it.
-George! Kramer!

11:18.110 --> 11:19.907
-Yeah?
-Take the rope...

11:20.079 --> 11:22.138
...thread it through the carabiner
and knot it.

11:22.314 --> 11:23.906
Then I'll climb up to where you are.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.415
-All right. George, you got it?
-Yeah.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.553
-You got it, George?
-Yeah.

11:28.721 --> 11:29.949
All right, take it.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.522
Hey, George,
you got anything to eat, dude?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.216
Yeah, I...

11:34.727 --> 11:36.558
I got some sandwiches.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.988
I got tuna and salmon salad, Tony...

11:41.167 --> 11:44.796
...because I know
you don't like peanut butter.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.198
What?

11:48.841 --> 11:51.275
Do some...

12:05.725 --> 12:07.920
I've got oil all over me.
Can I have your napkin?

12:08.094 --> 12:10.585
-What?
-Your napkin. I'm dripping.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.788
-Well, where's your napkin?
-I used it up.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.557
Well, I need mine.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.895
Oh, God, look at the time.
I gotta get to work.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.501
You know, I'd like to hear
about this job of yours.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.140
I told you already, it's very boring.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.436
You know, I think I had
a little too much garlic.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.136
-Can I have a piece of your gum?
-You're fine.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.410
-Oh, how's this thing work?
-Just press it.

12:32.618 --> 12:34.609
<i>-It's Elaine.
-Oh, come on up.</i>

12:35.788 --> 12:37.585
-Who is it?
-It's Elaine.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.853
-Is she coming up?
-Yeah.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.458
Your breath is a little garlicky.
You better take some gum.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.099
-Okay.
-Here, have a couple pieces.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.703
It's weak. Weak gum. Yeah.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.636
-Have some more. For the road.
-Isn't that too much?

12:56.809 --> 12:58.436
Trust me. Believe me.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.170
-It's good. Yes.
-Smells?

13:01.347 --> 13:03.372
Yeah. Stinks. Terrible.

13:03.749 --> 13:04.977
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.813
How are you? This is Jane. Elaine.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.248
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.491
Nice to meet you finally.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.356
It is so nice to meet you.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.689
I look forward to Saturday night.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.557
Yeah, me too.

13:21.934 --> 13:25.028
-Okay, so I'll see you Saturday night.
-Saturday night.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.536
What is with the gum?

13:33.712 --> 13:37.148
It's a big problem. She puts like four
pieces in her mouth. It's ridiculous.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.216
I don't think we can
get together Saturday.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.843
-Because of the gum?
-Well, it's too much. It's embarrassing.

13:43.923 --> 13:47.381
-Why does she chew so many?
-She always has to be different.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.996
-She's in there. I can hear her.
-All right, who's gonna tell her?

13:51.297 --> 13:52.958
-You tell her.
-It was your fault.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.157
If you hadn't come,
it wouldn't have happened!

13:55.534 --> 13:57.695
I was the one who was invited,
you...

13:57.870 --> 14:00.430
-Well, look. Look who's here.
-Hey!

14:00.606 --> 14:02.904
-What are you doing here?
-You're alive!

14:03.075 --> 14:04.770
Yeah. Yeah.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.474
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.545
-Well... Yes.
-For a little while.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.982
Where's Tony?

14:16.922 --> 14:18.822
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot...

14:20.526 --> 14:24.053
-You were supposed to tie the knot.
-What, did something happen?

14:24.463 --> 14:25.725
Well...

14:26.265 --> 14:28.961
...Tony took a bit of a tumble.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.767
His face? Did something
happened to his face?

14:35.107 --> 14:38.907
Well, it all depends on what
you mean by "happen."

14:39.111 --> 14:40.408
-He's alive.
-Yeah.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.774
What happened to his face?
Tell me, what happened?

14:42.948 --> 14:48.079
Well, you see, he slipped
and landed on a kind of a...

14:48.254 --> 14:49.812
-A rock.
-Yeah.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.447
-The ambulance got there quickly.
-A big rock.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.092
We rode with him to the hospital.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.820
Yeah. I sang "99 Bottles
of Beer on the Wall."

15:00.065 --> 15:03.057
Well, aside from that,
how'd he like the sandwiches?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.966
So, what did the doctor say?

15:10.643 --> 15:11.940
They said...

15:12.111 --> 15:15.638
-They said I'm coming along.
-Yeah.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.616
But what else did they say?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.278
Well, let's see. They said:

15:23.489 --> 15:25.787
"Tony, try to keep it clean."

15:25.991 --> 15:28.152
Right. Yeah. No, I mean...

15:28.327 --> 15:30.818
...did they get into stuff like...

15:31.030 --> 15:33.931
...long, jagged scars...

15:34.099 --> 15:37.694
...or gross deformities,
major skin grafts, stuff like that?

15:38.404 --> 15:40.872
I really don't remember.
I was kind of out of it...

15:41.040 --> 15:44.271
...the first couple of days.
I was on a lot of medication.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.774
It was kind of like a haze.
It was pretty cool.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.183
But, you know, in this
medicated haze...

15:53.352 --> 15:55.980
...in this sort of woozy state...

15:56.155 --> 15:58.385
...do you recall the words...

15:58.590 --> 16:02.492
..."radical reconstructive surgery"
being uttered?

16:02.828 --> 16:04.728
I don't know. I don't know.

16:05.197 --> 16:08.655
-Think, Tony. Think.
-I'm drawing a blank, babe.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.493
Excuse me.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.841
-Hi, Elaine.
-Yeah, this...

16:20.012 --> 16:23.140
-This isn't a very good time, George.
-I just wanted...

16:23.315 --> 16:24.873
...to talk to Tony for a minute.

16:25.050 --> 16:28.383
Step off, George.
I don't want to see you.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.045
-Me? Step off?
-Yeah.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.850
Tony says you better step off,
George, so...

16:34.026 --> 16:37.689
But why? It wasn't my fault. I...
You asked me for a sandwich. I...

16:37.863 --> 16:40.423
I made such delicious
sandwiches, Elaine.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.733
Just beat it, dude!

16:42.901 --> 16:45.199
<i>Here, Elaine, here. It's Superman.</i>

16:45.371 --> 16:49.637
Tony, please. Next time,
it'll just be the two of us.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.042
There won't be any next time,
George.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.514
-Oh, Tony, don't.
-Okay.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.780
Step off, George, okay?
Can you just step off? Step off.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.683
Step off. Step off.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.790
-George, wait, wait.
-Yes?

17:09.994 --> 17:12.122
Would you throw this trash out?

17:15.968 --> 17:18.402
Oh, I've been waiting a while for this.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.438
It's a shame Tony
got all banged up.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.580
We're not gonna be able
to get together.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.511
-Oh, that's too bad. What a shame.
-Yeah, it is.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.584
It's a damn shame.
A damn shame.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.454
-Maybe when he's feeling better.
-Yeah. Without a doubt. I'm down.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.487
-Oh, hey. How you doing?
-Hey, hey.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.026
-Jane, this is my neighbor, Kramer.
-Oh, hey.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.959
Hello, Kramer.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.734
Well, hello, Jane.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.434
Jerry's told me so much about you,
I feel like I know you intimately.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.407
I don't think so.
No, we never met.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.548
-I never talked to you on the phone.
-Where you going?

18:03.715 --> 18:06.343
-Uptown. To the Y.
-I'm going uptown. Wanna split a cab?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.183
What about the driver?

18:13.492 --> 18:14.925
What are you talking about?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.688
I changed my mind.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna go now.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.861
All right, I'll see you later.
Nice meeting you.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.523
See you.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.004
-What's with you?
-That's her.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.764
-Who?
-Erica! She's Erica!

18:29.308 --> 18:31.799
Oh, you think she's Erica,
the phone-sex woman?

18:31.977 --> 18:35.105
Jerry, that voice
is tattooed on my brain, it's her.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.646
-I'm telling you, it's her!
-Oh, you're crazy.

18:37.816 --> 18:42.810
Am I? Or am I so sane
that you just blew your mind?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.519
-It's impossible!
-Is it?

18:46.692 --> 18:50.958
Or is it so possible that your head
is spinning like a top?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.388
-It can't be!
-Can't it?

18:53.565 --> 18:57.160
Or is your entire world
just crashing down all around you?

18:57.336 --> 19:00.169
-All right. That's enough.
-Yeah!

19:04.009 --> 19:06.842
He's supposed to get
the bandages off on Sunday.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.746
-What if?
-What?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.839
You know:

19:13.886 --> 19:16.411
You're afraid he might look
like Zippy the Pinhead.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.647
Yeah. I mean,
what is my obligation here?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.190
You know, we were just dating.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.727
It was probably gonna be over
in a couple of weeks anyway.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.156
I thought you didn't care
about his looks.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.924
I lied.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.835
Are you kidding?
He's a mimbo. I know that.

19:34.740 --> 19:39.905
But he's my mimbo.
And even if he is a hideous freak...

19:40.078 --> 19:42.512
...maybe I can learn to love him.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.908
And maybe in some final irony...

19:47.119 --> 19:50.350
...I'll learn what love really is.

19:52.424 --> 19:53.721
You know, Jerry?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.390
I'm sorry. I didn't get most of that.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.528
-Is that Kramer over there?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.531
Hey, Kramer.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.499
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.467
-It's all set.
-What's all set?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.905
Erica's gonna meet me here.
Now we're gonna find out the truth.

20:12.077 --> 20:15.205
-How'd you get her to meet you here?
-We have a certain chemistry.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.106
Oh, my God!

20:18.283 --> 20:20.376
Hi. I thought I'd find you here.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.519
-Hello, Erica.
-Erica? What are you talking about?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.158
How could you say things
like that over the phone?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.056
What are you talking about?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.424
Selling sexual pleasure
on the phone?

20:32.598 --> 20:35.123
I sell paper goods, you jerk.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.961
Paper goods?

20:37.603 --> 20:38.968
Excuse me.
Do you have a tissue?

20:39.705 --> 20:43.141
No, I'm sorry. I can't spare it.
There's just not enough to spare.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.075
Where's the ladies' room?

20:51.016 --> 20:52.813
I have to go to the bathroom too.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.059
Oh, damn.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.431
Something wrong?

21:10.602 --> 21:14.265
Yeah, there's no toilet paper in here.
I usually check. Would you mind?

21:14.640 --> 21:18.576
I can't. I don't have it.
I don't have a square to spare.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.639
I can't spare a square.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.647
Hey, wait a minute.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.181
-I know you!
-That's right, honey.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.842
-And I know you!
-No. Wait!

21:29.054 --> 21:30.715
No!

21:35.394 --> 21:37.624
-Here. Take it.
-Thanks.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.230
Don't call me anymore.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.740
You either.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.556
Now, of course, the thing is
extreme sports. Bungee jumping.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.216
To me, the bungee jumping is a sport,
so is being a crash-test dummy.

22:09.394 --> 22:12.022
Just leaning does not
make it a sport.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.995
It's like a Wile E. Coyote idea,
isn't it?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.964
The thing I wonder about
the skydiving...

22:17.135 --> 22:19.194
...is why do they even
bother with the helmets?

22:21.606 --> 22:23.801
Can you almost make it?

22:24.676 --> 22:28.112
You might as well wear a party hat.
What's the difference?

22:28.280 --> 22:31.647
You jump out of a plane
20,000 feet in the air...

22:31.817 --> 22:33.808
...the chute doesn't open,
I got news for you:

22:33.985 --> 22:36.783
The helmet is now wearing you
for protection.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.456
Later on, the helmet is talking
to the other helmets:

22:39.725 --> 22:42.751
"Good thing he was there, or
I would have hit the ground directly."
