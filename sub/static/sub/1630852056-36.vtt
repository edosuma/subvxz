WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:01.633
You went and looked at the rings.

00:02.766 --> 00:03.600
I did.

00:04.966 --> 00:06.299
We were about to get married.

00:07.432 --> 00:08.266
Look happier.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.800
[laughter]

00:10.867 --> 00:12.266
Oh, he's happy.

00:12.333 --> 00:13.467
He should tell his face.

00:13.532 --> 00:16.000
[narrator] This is Judy Justice.

00:16.065 --> 00:18.100
[theme music plays]

00:33.066 --> 00:36.933
[narrator] Jessica Lager is suing
property inspector Keith Schlesser

00:37.000 --> 00:40.966
for the cost of two wedding rings
that could not be resized.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.899
[Kevin] Court, come to order. All rise.

00:47.366 --> 00:48.399
[Judy] Be seated, please.

00:48.466 --> 00:51.567
Hello, Judge. Case number 1022,
Lager vs. Schlesser.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.366
Thank you.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.066
Case is simple. Mrs. Lager,
you want your money back

00:57.133 --> 00:59.633
and you want to return
two rings that you bought

00:59.700 --> 01:01.232
from the defendant.

01:01.299 --> 01:03.265
Defendant says, "No backsies."

01:03.332 --> 01:04.533
You're right, Your Honor.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.867
Well, I know that that's your position
so I'm gonna ask you,

01:06.933 --> 01:08.966
Mr. Schlesser, a couple of questions.

01:09.033 --> 01:10.900
What I get from your answer is

01:10.966 --> 01:13.933
that several years ago,
a relative of yours got arrested.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.165
Yes.

01:15.233 --> 01:18.500
And there was bail set,
rather high bail.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.099
-Yes.
-And you posted that bail.

01:20.165 --> 01:21.400
-Yes, I did.
-For this relative.

01:21.466 --> 01:24.567
[Judy] And in order to ensure
your repayment,

01:24.632 --> 01:27.867
-this relative gave you two rings.
-[Keith] Yes.

01:27.933 --> 01:31.265
A man's ring and a woman's ring
to hold as collateral.

01:31.332 --> 01:34.099
And I assume that this relative
never paid you back.

01:34.165 --> 01:36.033
Actually, he did pay me partial.

01:36.099 --> 01:38.066
Oh. How much partial?

01:38.133 --> 01:40.933
-Three thousand.
-[Judy] And how much was the bail?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.165
-Eight thousand.
-Okay, so you were down five?

01:43.233 --> 01:44.099
I was down five.

01:44.165 --> 01:46.567
[Judy] And in order to recoup
some of that money,

01:46.633 --> 01:49.933
I assume that you made an arrangement
with this relative

01:50.000 --> 01:52.165
-that you could sell the rings.
-Yes.

01:52.233 --> 01:56.133
[Judy] That's what I gather.
And so in 2020...

01:56.200 --> 01:57.633
Let's go back a second.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.599
In what year did you take
possession of the rings?

02:00.667 --> 02:02.799
Approximately five years ago, Your Honor.

02:02.867 --> 02:04.900
So you've had them in your
possession for quite a while.

02:04.966 --> 02:07.200
-Yes.
-Where have they been in your possession?

02:07.266 --> 02:08.667
At my house in the safe.

02:08.734 --> 02:12.532
Sometime in 2020,
you're gonna tell me the month,

02:12.599 --> 02:16.366
you decided to list them
on the Internet for sale.

02:16.432 --> 02:18.966
What month in 2020?

02:19.033 --> 02:20.332
I don't recall, Your Honor.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.066
Well, let's try to think hard.

02:22.133 --> 02:25.533
I could probably look in my phone
and tell you according to the marketplace.

02:25.599 --> 02:26.466
Perfect.

02:29.466 --> 02:30.766
Around...

02:30.834 --> 02:33.099
October 26th of 2020.

02:33.165 --> 02:35.099
Do you have the ad there that you placed?

02:35.165 --> 02:37.066
-[Keith] Yes, I do.
-I'd like to see it, please.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.866
Thanks. You can give her my phone.

02:42.099 --> 02:44.165
And here is also...

02:46.667 --> 02:48.332
pictures of the posting.

02:53.734 --> 02:54.633
Oh.

02:58.033 --> 03:00.699
So you listed them for what?
$4,500?

03:00.766 --> 03:02.967
I listed them, Your Honor, for $5,000.

03:03.032 --> 03:05.667
Well, this says $4,500, October 26th.

03:05.734 --> 03:09.599
I had reduced the price,
not knowing what the value was.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.633
[Judy] Now, just listen to me.
Let's not editorialize this.

03:12.699 --> 03:15.199
You listed them for what price?

03:15.265 --> 03:18.900
The original marketplace list
was for $5,000.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.199
Okay, and just a second.
And when was that?

03:22.265 --> 03:25.165
-Approximately two months--
-[Judy] Not-- not "approximately."

03:25.233 --> 03:28.332
I asked you a question. I said,
"What did you list them for?"

03:28.400 --> 03:30.000
And you said,
"I'm gonna show you."

03:30.066 --> 03:35.099
You said, "I listed them on October 26th."
October 26th, it says $4,500.

03:35.165 --> 03:38.866
I wanna know long
they had been on marketplace.

03:38.933 --> 03:41.699
When did you first list the rings?

03:41.766 --> 03:43.533
I don't know the exact date,

03:43.599 --> 03:45.734
but I would say probably
three months prior to that.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.332
[Judy] Okay.
So maybe sometime in July?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.599
-Approximately, yes.
-[Judy] Of 2020.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.734
-You listed them for sale for $5,000.
-Yes.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.332
And then in October,
you reduced the price to $4,500.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.599
Yes.

04:01.667 --> 04:02.633
And nobody bought them.

04:02.699 --> 04:03.633
Right.

04:03.699 --> 04:07.265
On what date did you
contact the defendant?

04:07.332 --> 04:08.233
April 5th.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.532
Of 2021.

04:09.599 --> 04:10.667
Of 2021.

04:10.734 --> 04:12.766
[Judy] So now they've
been on the market

04:12.834 --> 04:15.432
July, August, September, October,

04:15.500 --> 04:19.033
November, December, January,
February, March, April.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.699
-Ten months!
-[Keith] Yes, Your Honor.

04:20.766 --> 04:22.367
Without so much as a nibble.

04:22.432 --> 04:24.733
No, I had different bites by people that--

04:24.800 --> 04:26.199
Show me on here where you had bites.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.667
[Keith] Um...
If I could have the phone.

04:29.632 --> 04:31.367
It should be right on here.

04:31.432 --> 04:32.933
Different ones that contacted me.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.933
Odell... right there is one of 'em.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.367
But to see all of them...

04:36.899 --> 04:38.966
Did anybody offer you
a firm price for them...

04:39.033 --> 04:41.367
-No, Your Honor.
-[Judy] ...prior to the plaintiff

04:42.066 --> 04:43.766
offering you $3,000?

04:43.834 --> 04:44.867
-No.
-[Judy] Okay. So--

04:44.933 --> 04:46.367
[Jessica] I have a-- Exc...

04:46.432 --> 04:47.266
What?

04:47.332 --> 04:50.667
He actually had them listed for $3,000
when I first--

04:50.733 --> 04:52.399
[Judy] May I see it?
Do you have it?

04:52.466 --> 04:56.199
Uh, I don't have it saying exactly $3,000,
but I do have in our messages,

04:56.266 --> 04:57.699
uh, he did change the price
and it does say

04:57.766 --> 04:59.199
right here that he
changed the price on it.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.934
[Judy] May I-- May I see that?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.165
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kevin] Thank you.

05:02.233 --> 05:05.000
Did you reduce the price to $3,000?

05:05.065 --> 05:06.533
-I did, Your Honor.
-Okay.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.733
In what month did you
reduce the price to $3,000?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.867
Right before I had them appraised.

05:11.934 --> 05:14.966
Just-Just-Just-- Listen,
you're editorializing to me, sir.

05:15.033 --> 05:17.065
-I had the--
-[Judy] I just want the month

05:17.132 --> 05:21.065
and day that you
reduced the price to $3,000.

05:21.132 --> 05:23.966
Right before she contacted me,
probably a week prior to that.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.632
-[Judy] You contacted him on April 5th?
-April 5th.

05:26.699 --> 05:29.899
[Judy] When you contacted him,
you had seen pictures of the rings online?

05:29.966 --> 05:30.834
[Jessica] I did.

05:30.899 --> 05:32.100
Were you getting married
or were you married?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.867
We were about to get married.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.466
[Judy] So this was
a big purchase for you.

05:35.533 --> 05:36.399
[Jessica] It was
a big purchase for me.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.199
Is it your first marriage?

05:38.266 --> 05:40.199
It is. We've been together for 20 years.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.432
-Oh, well!
-[Jessica] Yeah.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.867
That's nice. Take a deep breath.
[chuckles]

05:43.933 --> 05:45.899
[chuckles] So... Yup.

05:45.966 --> 05:46.933
Look happier.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.165
[laughter]

05:50.766 --> 05:52.000
Oh, he's happy.

05:52.066 --> 05:53.266
-Oh, is he? Is he happy?
-[Jessica] Oh, he's happy.

05:53.332 --> 05:54.199
-[Adam] Yeah.
-Is he happy?

05:54.266 --> 05:55.699
He should tell his face.

05:55.766 --> 05:58.867
[laughter]

06:00.834 --> 06:03.266
Anyway, you reduced the price to $3,000.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.567
The plaintiff called you.
She said, "I love the rings.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.899
I want to come out and see them."

06:06.966 --> 06:08.966
Then you took the rings
to have them appraised.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.300
Now, let me understand this, sir.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.399
This is what you want
this face to believe.

06:13.466 --> 06:16.367
That you've had these rings in your
possession for five years.

06:16.432 --> 06:18.899
You took them as collateral for a loan.

06:18.966 --> 06:21.332
They had been sitting in your safe,
according to you.

06:21.399 --> 06:24.033
You put them on marketplace to sell.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.966
For ten months, they didn't sell.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.332
All of a sudden,
you had an "aha" moment

06:28.399 --> 06:30.100
after you got somebody who said,

06:30.165 --> 06:33.399
"You know, list them for $3,000,
I will pay $3,000,

06:33.466 --> 06:35.466
I just want to come out
and see 'em," and then

06:35.533 --> 06:37.699
you decided to take them
and have them appraised.

06:37.766 --> 06:40.399
That's what--
That's what you want this face to buy.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.432
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Okay. All right. Well...

06:43.266 --> 06:44.132
Good for you.

06:44.199 --> 06:45.966
[dramatic music]

06:46.033 --> 06:50.766
In my contract, I wasn't gonna give them
the originals until the balance was paid.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.066
Just a second. Are you talking to yourself
or are you talking to me?

06:53.132 --> 06:54.199
I'm talking to you, Your Honor.

06:54.266 --> 06:56.567
Well, I don't wanna hear you
until you show me the appraisal.

07:01.399 --> 07:03.266
[theme music plays]

07:07.934 --> 07:10.567
[narrator] Jessica Lager
is accusing Keith Schlesser

07:10.632 --> 07:12.600
of selling her two wedding rings,

07:12.666 --> 07:15.432
falsely claiming they could be resized.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.800
Now, you took it to an appraiser,
a jeweler.

07:19.867 --> 07:20.699
Yes, Your Honor.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.600
[Judy] And without having
any conversation with me,

07:23.667 --> 07:26.667
do you have the appraisal
from the jeweler?

07:26.733 --> 07:27.567
Yes, I do, Your Honor.

07:27.632 --> 07:29.132
[Judy] I'd love to take a look at it.

07:29.966 --> 07:31.100
Thank you.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.699
What is this that you're giving me?

07:41.766 --> 07:42.733
What is this?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.266
That is the appraisal.

07:44.332 --> 07:45.899
What it cost me to have them appraised.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.834
I don't care what it co--

07:46.899 --> 07:49.165
I wanna see the appraisal
that you had done.

07:49.632 --> 07:51.233
-What?
-[Judy] I wanna see the appraisal.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.332
-Not the...
-Okay, I am looking for the copies of it

07:53.399 --> 07:54.867
that I have, Your Honor.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.600
In my contract, I wasn't gonna give 'em
the originals until

07:58.667 --> 07:59.933
the balance was paid.

08:00.065 --> 08:01.065
Just a second.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.800
Are you talking--
Are you talking to yourself

08:02.867 --> 08:03.834
or are you talking to me?

08:03.899 --> 08:04.766
I'm talking to you, Your Honor.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.800
Well, I don't wanna hear you
until you show me the appraisal.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.065
-[Keith] Okay.
-[chuckles]

08:08.934 --> 08:09.800
Ah, here they are.

08:24.733 --> 08:27.367
[Judy] Okay, so now you take them
and you have them appraised

08:27.432 --> 08:31.699
by this jeweler. They're not
GIA certifications of the diamonds.

08:31.766 --> 08:35.133
They're a jeweler's evaluation
of what these little diamonds were.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.966
And then you call her back and tell her
that the price has changed

08:38.033 --> 08:39.834
to $5,000?

08:39.899 --> 08:44.200
I messaged her back and told her,
"Before you drive all the way down here,

08:44.265 --> 08:47.366
I have had them appraised
and they appraised it a lot higher

08:47.432 --> 08:49.299
than I anticipated.

08:49.366 --> 08:52.899
That I couldn't sell them for $3,000,
that I wanted $5,000 for them.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.466
And she said all she had was $3,000.

08:55.533 --> 08:58.933
So at that point, I said that
I would consider working with them.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.432
If they were that adamant about the rings,

09:01.500 --> 09:02.799
I would let 'em make payments to me.

09:02.866 --> 09:07.332
Can you explain to me why in the five
years that you had these two rings

09:07.399 --> 09:08.767
you haven't had them appraised?

09:08.833 --> 09:10.700
Before you put them on marketplace?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.633
Before you tried to sell them for a year?

09:12.700 --> 09:15.100
I mean, you don't appear
to be a stupid man.

09:15.166 --> 09:18.166
-I'm not, Your Honor.
-If you have-- If you have a product,

09:18.232 --> 09:21.767
and you are unsure of its value,
and it's not your specialty,

09:21.833 --> 09:23.366
and you want to put it up for sale,

09:23.432 --> 09:25.899
the idea is if, whether it be a car,

09:25.966 --> 09:27.500
or a piece of jewelry,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.533
or a painting,

09:29.600 --> 09:30.866
you have it appraised!

09:30.933 --> 09:33.767
You go and you have it appraised, say,
"Well, this is what the appraisal is.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.265
And this is what I'm gonna ask for

09:36.332 --> 09:38.265
or this is what
I'm prepared to sell it for."

09:38.332 --> 09:39.966
That's what a thinking person does,

09:40.033 --> 09:42.232
and you don't look like
a non-thinking person.

09:42.299 --> 09:45.899
You took collateral for this loan
that you made to your relative.

09:45.966 --> 09:48.100
You got him to repay part of it.

09:48.165 --> 09:52.232
You were selling the collateral
to cover the other part of it.

09:52.299 --> 09:54.066
That all sounds like a thinking person.

09:54.133 --> 09:57.466
I have trouble thinking that a thinking
person puts something on

09:57.533 --> 10:01.366
the marketplace without
having it appraised first,

10:01.432 --> 10:04.567
makes a deal, pretty much on the phone,

10:04.633 --> 10:07.866
for the asking price,
and then takes it to have it appraised.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.466
That just doesn't make sense to me.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.567
And if it doesn't make sense to me,

10:11.633 --> 10:13.066
it usually isn't the way it happens.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.200
Okay, now.
But this isn't what the case is about.

10:16.265 --> 10:18.500
They came on the sixth?

10:18.567 --> 10:20.133
The ninth is when we actually
went and met him.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.066
[Judy] Okay.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.899
So on April 9th,
you went and looked at the rings.

10:23.966 --> 10:24.933
-I did.
-Now, Kevin,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.232
could I please have the rings?

10:26.299 --> 10:27.500
I want to take a look at them.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.100
Thank you.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.366
[Judy] Well, this ladies' ring
is very lovely.

10:42.432 --> 10:43.966
Oh, isn't it? I love it.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.633
[Judy] Yeah. It's really very lovely.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.966
If only it could fit.

10:47.033 --> 10:50.299
[Judy] When you went to his house
to try on these rings,

10:50.366 --> 10:52.533
-they were too small for the two of you.
-Very small. Yes.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.567
-Your Honor?
-[Judy] And did you--?

10:53.633 --> 10:54.533
What?

10:54.600 --> 10:56.799
She couldn't even get that ring
over her knuckle.

10:56.866 --> 10:58.200
-On her little finger.
-[Judy] I--I--I...

10:58.265 --> 10:59.966
You don't have to help me.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.033
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-[Judy] The rings are very small.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.366
-[Jessica] Right.
-[Judy] Did you discuss that

11:03.432 --> 11:04.700
-with the defendant?
-Of course I did.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.734
I asked him if it could be sized
and he said yes.

11:07.799 --> 11:10.767
[Judy] Well, just a second. Mrs. Lager,
I'm gonna ask you this question.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.633
Did he tell you what he did for a living?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.633
N-no.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.567
So you go in to buy
a pig in a poke from somebody

11:16.633 --> 11:19.533
without really an appraisal,
because you are not getting these things

11:19.600 --> 11:22.366
appraised yourself before you're
committing to $3,000,

11:22.432 --> 11:25.366
-which I assume is a lot of money for you?
-Right.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.866
And you're starting a life together
after 20 years...

11:27.933 --> 11:29.133
Tell your face you're happy.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.299
[laughter]

11:31.366 --> 11:34.366
And clearly,
this ring isn't gonna fit you.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.299
Correct.

11:35.366 --> 11:38.033
Why would you ask somebody--
What kind of work do you do

11:38.100 --> 11:39.265
or did you do?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.667
I'm a property inspector, Your Honor.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.866
He's a property inspector.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.767
He knows nothing about jewelry!

11:43.834 --> 11:46.033
Because he just had got them appraised

11:46.100 --> 11:49.533
and I asked him if he--
if he knew that

11:49.600 --> 11:50.700
it couldn't be a...

11:50.767 --> 11:54.700
Why would you ask a property appraiser
if he knew whether

11:54.767 --> 11:56.399
a ring could be sized?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.299
Because they were his rings and...

11:58.366 --> 11:59.200
[Judy] Say it.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.700
-I mean, I guess I don't know.
-[Judy] If it's property that

12:01.767 --> 12:04.265
is somewhere within his realm
of expertise,

12:04.332 --> 12:05.432
I could understand it.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.799
But you're asking somebody
who's selling something

12:07.866 --> 12:09.432
that clearly didn't belong to him.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.133
I mean, he could just say,
"I don't know."

12:11.200 --> 12:13.633
-Or "No," or "I'm not sure."
-He could've. He could've.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.066
-And that would've been fine.
-I mean, that's--

12:15.633 --> 12:16.567
What would've been fine?

12:16.633 --> 12:17.799
If he would've said,
"No," or "I don't know."

12:17.866 --> 12:21.133
No, what would've been okay
is if you said to him,

12:21.200 --> 12:25.133
"I will only take these on condition
that I take them to a jeweler,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.332
and see if they could be sized
in my size."

12:27.399 --> 12:29.667
[sighs] See, at first, I wanted
to meet at a jeweler,

12:29.734 --> 12:32.165
and, um...
he said that would've been fine.

12:32.232 --> 12:35.100
But then a few days after
we had made that agreement,

12:35.165 --> 12:37.834
he just took it upon himself
to take them to get appraised

12:37.899 --> 12:40.366
-and then...
-[Judy] No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:40.432 --> 12:42.866
You wanted to take them to a jeweler.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.734
I wanted to meet him at a jeweler
to--to start with.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.133
Yes. I wanted to.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.066
Oh. When you answered his ad,

12:50.133 --> 12:53.500
did you have a communication with him
that you wanted to meet him,

12:53.567 --> 12:55.033
not at his house, but at a jeweler?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.567
Yes. To start with, yes.

12:56.633 --> 13:00.100
-Yes. Was that by text message or phone?
-It was message.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.399
I'd like to see it.

13:06.399 --> 13:07.567
[Jessica] It's on that first page there.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.000
[Judy] Well, you say it in
one of these text messages, sir.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.166
She asks you what the sizes are.

13:21.232 --> 13:24.432
You say, "I know the man's is an 11
only because it fits me

13:24.500 --> 13:26.232
and the woman I'm not sure of.

13:26.299 --> 13:29.299
Another ladies' ring is about
one and a half carats

13:29.366 --> 13:31.767
and it's wrapped
in princess-cut diamonds.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.866
The men's is just original-cut diamonds.

13:33.933 --> 13:37.966
I don't know a lot about it.
I have had them at a jeweler

13:38.033 --> 13:41.232
and got somewhat
of an appraisal from them,

13:41.299 --> 13:43.366
but I didn't want to pay
hundreds of dollars

13:43.432 --> 13:46.899
in insurance appraisal
if I have sold them.

13:46.966 --> 13:51.265
I would pay that if
you're that interested in them."

13:51.332 --> 13:53.000
And she says to you,

13:53.066 --> 13:57.533
"We could meet at a jeweler.
You don't need to spend extra money.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.966
I'm very interested. Are you open to
meeting this Friday at four?" "Yes."

14:02.033 --> 14:03.533
Well, why didn't you meet at the jeweler?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.667
[dramatic music]

14:05.734 --> 14:10.066
I said, "Why didn't you wait
and go with them to the jeweler?"

14:10.133 --> 14:11.799
That's what she asked you to do.

14:11.866 --> 14:14.500
I mean, I don't care what this
piece of paper says.

14:14.567 --> 14:15.899
It looks like a crock of baloney to me.

14:20.966 --> 14:23.265
[theme music plays]

14:28.200 --> 14:30.667
[narrator] Jessica Lager
claims Keith Schlesser

14:30.734 --> 14:33.767
refuses to reimburse her
for two wedding rings

14:33.834 --> 14:35.567
that could not be resized.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.899
Okay. She says to you,

14:37.966 --> 14:39.567
"We could meet at a jeweler."

14:39.633 --> 14:41.100
Well, why didn't you meet at the jeweler?

14:41.165 --> 14:44.332
Your Honor, I tried to take them rings
to Rogers & Holland

14:44.399 --> 14:45.866
where they-- the store that they were
bought from.

14:45.933 --> 14:48.933
I'm asking you why
you didn't meet her at a jeweler

14:49.000 --> 14:50.299
as she asked. You said,

14:50.366 --> 14:52.033
"Could we meet at a jeweler?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.734
You don't need
to spend any extra money."

14:54.799 --> 14:57.165
Because you said you didn't want to.

14:57.232 --> 14:58.567
"I'm very interested."

14:58.633 --> 15:01.600
And then your response is,
"I have dropped off the wedding rings

15:01.667 --> 15:04.200
at the jeweler's, as you
can see in the photo,

15:04.265 --> 15:07.133
to have them appraised.
I will have them back Friday morning,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.000
appraised for insurance purposes."

15:09.066 --> 15:14.166
My question to you is, sir,
she asked you to meet you on Friday

15:14.232 --> 15:17.966
at the jeweler's, which could've
answered all the questions.

15:18.033 --> 15:21.133
Whether the rings could be sized, right?

15:21.200 --> 15:25.000
-Yes.
-Whether they had the value

15:25.066 --> 15:28.700
of what you say they were valued at.

15:28.767 --> 15:31.432
And for some reason,
you chose not to do that.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.500
For some reason,
you chose to go to the jeweler...

15:34.567 --> 15:35.734
allegedly,

15:35.799 --> 15:40.299
by yourself and meet them
at the house on Friday.

15:40.366 --> 15:43.432
On the same Friday.
Could you tell me why?

15:43.500 --> 15:44.866
[Keith] I went to have them appraised.

15:44.933 --> 15:47.633
They wanted $200 apiece
to appraise them rings.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.700
I wasn't about to pay that.
It wouldn't buy back their own property.

15:50.767 --> 15:54.767
So I decided to go to my own jeweler
and have them appraised.

15:54.834 --> 15:59.200
And I got them appraised for $125 per ring
versus $200.

15:59.265 --> 16:01.734
Just a second.
That's not my question.

16:01.799 --> 16:05.933
I said, "Why didn't you wait
and go with them to the jeweler?"

16:06.000 --> 16:07.933
That's what she asked you to do.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.567
I mean, I don't care
what this piece of paper says.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.600
It looks like a crock of baloney to me.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.500
So, my question to you, sir, is

16:15.567 --> 16:20.399
why didn't you wait to go to the jeweler
with them until Friday?

16:20.466 --> 16:22.833
Because I guess I wanted to know
what they were actually worth.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.033
Then you should've done that in the five
years you had 'em in your possession.

16:26.100 --> 16:30.000
But I also wrote a contract
that she signed, in an "as is."

16:30.066 --> 16:31.232
I'd like to see it.

16:32.232 --> 16:33.734
You're more than welcome.

16:35.265 --> 16:36.933
Here's the contract, sir.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.834
[sighs] A contract is
a contract is a contract...

16:47.600 --> 16:51.332
You have proof that you have
title to these two rings?

16:51.399 --> 16:54.600
Um, I got a letter from my stepson from...

16:54.667 --> 16:59.232
him in prison, stating that the rings were
given to me as collateral.

16:59.299 --> 17:02.166
Well, he can only give his ring.
He can't give his wife's ring.

17:02.232 --> 17:03.966
It was his ring.

17:04.032 --> 17:06.000
[Judy] No.
He could give away his wedding band.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.700
That's your only out, Madam.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.000
This is a contract that you signed,
do you understand that?

17:10.066 --> 17:10.967
I know.

17:11.032 --> 17:13.333
The problem is that
you took them to jewelers

17:13.400 --> 17:15.666
-and you can't have them resized.
-[Jessica] Right.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.099
-Is that the problem?
-[Keith] Your Honor?

17:17.165 --> 17:18.032
That is the problem.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.567
All right. "The rings were given to Mr.--
as collateral for my bail money.

17:20.633 --> 17:21.900
Thank you for your time."

17:21.967 --> 17:25.133
-I don't care. You wrote this contract.
-Yes, I did.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.866
Do you know that I actually--
She's stuck with this contract

17:28.933 --> 17:30.834
unless I can find a loophole for her.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.066
Of which I'm-- [laughs]
fortunately, I can!

17:34.567 --> 17:38.066
Because you have to be able to show me
title to the property.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.333
There are two rings here.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.532
There's a man's ring
and there's a woman's ring.

17:41.599 --> 17:45.599
And your relative, and I'm
not gonna say-- whoever it is

17:45.666 --> 17:49.467
that gave you these rings,
I don't know whether they had authority

17:49.532 --> 17:51.567
to give away the woman's ring.
I have no idea.

17:51.633 --> 17:53.032
The woman's ring is the expensive one.

17:53.099 --> 17:57.299
The woman's ring, allegedly,
has the solitaire diamond that's a carat.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.834
That's a carat and has some
stones around it.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.467
That doesn't belong to a guy.

18:01.532 --> 18:04.333
-It was given back to him by his wife.
-Just a second. Just a--

18:04.400 --> 18:06.000
I don't know that!

18:06.066 --> 18:07.967
And you don't have anything
to prove that.

18:08.032 --> 18:09.633
-I guess so--
-[Judy] You have a letter from him

18:09.700 --> 18:12.133
saying, "I gave you the rings
as collateral,"

18:12.200 --> 18:15.666
but there's nothing here that says that
he gives you permission to sell them.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.133
-I guess I had no--
-[Judy] Just a second!

18:17.200 --> 18:20.666
There's nothing here that gives you
permission to sell them.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.165
Well, he did verbally.

18:22.967 --> 18:26.066
-[laughs] Perfect. Perfect.
-For whatever good that is.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.900
-Sometimes, sometimes written contracts--
-[Keith] Your Honor,

18:27.967 --> 18:30.467
-she also said that she has a...
-[Judy] Sometimes contracts--

18:30.532 --> 18:32.733
You wrote this contract.
Clearly, you wrote this contract.

18:32.799 --> 18:33.967
You're the one who wrote in this contract,

18:34.032 --> 18:38.532
"The sale and transfer of this property
is hereby made on an 'as is' condition

18:38.599 --> 18:42.900
without any implied warranties,
with no recourse to the seller,

18:42.967 --> 18:47.366
provided that the seller can issue
proof of title to the property

18:47.432 --> 18:49.467
without any liens or encumbrances."

18:49.532 --> 18:51.567
That's what I'm putting to you, sir.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.099
She wants to give you the rings back
and she wants her money back.

18:54.165 --> 18:57.799
And you paid him $3,000, so you
have to show me proof of title

18:57.866 --> 19:01.500
to these rings without encumbrances.
And I don't think you can do that.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.200
That's the only proof that I can clear,
Your Honor.

19:03.266 --> 19:05.866
-[Judy] And-- And you can't do that.
-Right.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.366
[Judy] And they've had these rings
for a couple of months.

19:07.432 --> 19:08.866
You've had them for five years.

19:08.933 --> 19:13.066
So, you know, they can go back to eBay
or wherever you put them.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.567

19:20.933 --> 19:23.767
I'm so happy, because I knew
that he was just a scammer.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.567
And I feel like he tried to scam me
from the start.

19:25.633 --> 19:29.467
They called my jeweler.
One question they did not ask the jeweler

19:29.532 --> 19:31.967
is whether them rings could be resized.

19:32.032 --> 19:35.432
When I seen the rings to start with,
I was just, like, in love right away.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.467
I wanted to have them.

19:36.532 --> 19:37.767
She tried to put it on her little finger

19:37.834 --> 19:39.532
and it wouldn't even go over
her first knuckle.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.532
Because he had told me
that they could be sized.

19:41.599 --> 19:43.432
You know, stupid is what stupid does.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.032
I just feel like
he was trying to scam me.

19:45.099 --> 19:46.933
Well, I would've thought
that they wouldn't have bought 'em.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.200
But they had a contract.

19:48.266 --> 19:50.500
Because they couldn't fit me,
I got rings that can't fit.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.500
What's the point of that?

19:52.165 --> 19:55.467
So, Sarah, this is a perfect example
of "let the buyer beware."

19:55.532 --> 19:58.799
If it looks like too much of a bargain,
it's usually not a bargain.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.333
Want to spend $3,000 for rings,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.066
probably should buy them
at a reputable place.

20:04.133 --> 20:07.000
You always take a risk
when you buy things online.

20:07.066 --> 20:08.799
In this case, there was a contract.

20:08.866 --> 20:11.500
In that contract,
that the defendant wrote,

20:11.567 --> 20:13.467
he said he had to produce proof of title.

20:13.532 --> 20:16.099
So I was able to do the right thing.

20:16.165 --> 20:19.467
And bottom line is, the law is supposed
to be doing the right thing.

20:19.532 --> 20:21.967
And at the end of the case,
the just thing is supposed to happen.

20:22.032 --> 20:24.333
They got their money back,
he'll get his rings back,

20:24.400 --> 20:25.866
he could try to sell them again,

20:25.933 --> 20:27.900
but hopefully
enough people will watch this

20:27.967 --> 20:32.200
that they'll be careful about buying
expensive items they know nothing about.
