- So, it's sunrise confession time, Ed.

Ed, if you start telling me
you're falling in love again...

03:05.561 --> 03:07.813
I'm gonna have to remind you
of that time we made you propose...

03:07.897 --> 03:11.275

Edwin!

03:26.999 --> 03:29.460
Hey, come on now.
I told you about these people.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.463
They only mate with their own kind.
It's called yuppie inbreeding.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.174
That's why so many of them are retarded
and wear the same clothes.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.259
They're not human.
They don't feel love.

03:37.343 --> 03:41.138
They only negotiate love moments.
They're evil, Edwin.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.641
They're repulsed by imperfection,
horrified by the banal...

03:43.724 --> 03:47.478
everything that America stands for,
everything that you and I fight for.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.064

04:10.084 --> 04:11.669
I'll be sending you a thought today...

04:11.752 --> 04:16.673
as I lie in the back of my stretch limo,
having sex with the teenager of my choice...

04:16.757 --> 04:23.264
and that thought will be,
"Thank God I'm me."

Some of this is very funny.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.695
They even secured the rights
to the Donna Summer song...

04:37.778 --> 04:39.238
to play over the credits.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.615
Ooh, I have chills.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.618
Are you sure they want me?
I'm not gonna read it unless I have an offer.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.370
Jack, of course.
Not even a question.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.163
When I talked to them
on the phone this morning...

04:48.247 --> 04:50.624
I could smell how much
they want you for it.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.210
- I could smell it over the phone.
- [Knocking On Window]

04:53.294 --> 04:54.920

Do you have...

04:59.550 --> 05:01.552
I'm not opening this window.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.932
Couple of quarters isn't gonna
make any difference anyway.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.859
I hate my cheeks.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.866
Raoul called before... about dinner.

05:23.949 --> 05:28.746
Oh, God. About dinner as a concept
or about dinner with Raoul?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.581
You're so witty.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.208
I've got to get out of here, Jack,
and do something.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.670
You know, tomorrow
is a very big day for me.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.006
It would be nice if you pretended
like you understood.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.091
Fine. I'll say no.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.011
- They're putting me on film tomorrow.
- Fine.

05:45.095 --> 05:49.266
First time in my life,
I'll be a voice <i>with</i> a body.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.355
You know what that means,
what this could lead to?

05:54.438 --> 05:57.441
It's a sitcom, Jack.
You're not defining pi.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.984
Oh.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.111
I'll remember that
the next time you get excited...

06:01.195 --> 06:04.198

06:04.865 --> 06:06.784
You want some?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.494
No. I have to work.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.245
How un-'60s of you.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.123
I was nine in the '60s.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.959
Oh.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.420
I used to think...

06:18.504 --> 06:21.298
my biography ought to be entitled...

06:21.382 --> 06:26.011
<i>Jack Lucas.:
The Face Behind the Voice.</i>

06:27.054 --> 06:31.225

25:21.938 --> 25:24.190
That's why they sent you.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.275
- The little...
- Yes, yes.

25:27.401 --> 25:30.071
You see, they work for... him.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.074
So do I.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.992
Him?

25:35.076 --> 25:36.994
God.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.789
I'm the janitor of God.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.374
I know.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.128
Yeah. Hey, I know how you feel.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.881
They came to me about a year ago.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.758
I was sitting on the john...

25:50.842 --> 25:53.469
having one of those really satisfying
bowel movements.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.513
You know those ones
that border on mystical?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.139
Where you're like...

25:57.223 --> 26:01.477
[Grunting]

26:07.900 --> 26:10.236
Oh!

26:10.319 --> 26:12.655
And there they were.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.326
Hundreds of the cutest little fat people...

26:17.410 --> 26:19.579
floating right in front of me.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.374
It was wonderful, and then...

26:23.457 --> 26:25.918
they spoke...

26:26.002 --> 26:28.629
and they said that I had been chosen...

26:28.713 --> 26:31.883
to get back something very special
that <i>he</i> had lost...

26:31.966 --> 26:33.634
and my part would be very dangerous.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.554
And I said,
"Whoa! Hold it right there."

26:36.637 --> 26:39.140
I mean, you start seeing
floating little fat people...

26:39.223 --> 26:42.059
that tell you that you're
on a mission from God...

26:42.143 --> 26:44.437
they'll slap you some heavy Thorazine.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.148
I said, "Give me a sign."

26:47.231 --> 26:49.650
And they said,
"Look in <i>Progressive Architecture.</i>

26:49.734 --> 26:51.903
February '88. Page 33."

26:54.196 --> 26:56.616
That's pretty specific, huh?

26:56.699 --> 26:58.242
Bingo!

26:58.326 --> 27:01.329
He knows. He knows. He knows.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.873
It's right here.
Where is it? A, B, F... F, M!

27:03.956 --> 27:05.875
M! M.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.044
It's under "miscellaneous,"
not "mythology."

27:08.127 --> 27:10.546
Oh. Look at this. Here it is.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.548
Let's see this.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.303
Look. See it?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.805
Mm-hmm. Langdon Carmichael.

27:19.889 --> 27:23.142
No, no. Right there. See it?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.478
What?

27:27.063 --> 27:28.564
The grail.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.985
The Holy Grail.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.782
It's God's symbol of divine grace.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.951
- The Holy...
- Yes.

27:40.034 --> 27:44.747
Some billionaire has got the Holy Grail
in his library on Fifth Avenue.

27:44.830 --> 27:48.042
My thoughts exactly. Who'd think you'd find
anything divine on the Upper East Side?

27:48.125 --> 27:50.419
I don't mean to be fiippant
or enrage you or anything...

27:50.503 --> 27:52.129
but you're a psychotic man.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.007
- I know.
- A very nice psychotic man.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.802
- Oh.
- I appreciate what you did.

27:57.885 --> 28:01.097
- I think it was a brave and noble thing.
- Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.683
I'm sure I'm gonna see a lot of you...

28:03.766 --> 28:06.102
on various talk shows
when you get the grail.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.396
Please, don't go.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.606
I can't.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.441
I can't get it.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.987
Because he's out there.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.364
He's always out there.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.744
That's why you can get it.
That's why you're the one.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.124
I'm not the one.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.167
I'm not anyone.

Take care of yourself, Jack.
Give my love to the wife, huh?

29:18.591 --> 29:21.802
- I'm not married.
- Really? You look married.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.349
Hey, don't be a stranger.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.436

29:42.198 --> 29:44.825
Hey! Hey, where you coming from?

29:44.909 --> 29:48.204
Uh, the basement, I think.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.668
- Hey, hold it. Hold it.
- Huh?

29:54.752 --> 29:57.046
Listen, are you a friend of Parry's?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.882
- No.
- I don't allow no entertainin'.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.719
Look, I let him stay here out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy...

30:03.803 --> 30:07.932
but I'm not runnin' a hotel
and nobody's taking advantage of me.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.517
Tragedy?

30:09.600 --> 30:13.604
He and his wife were in some bar
and some nut comes in with a shotgun...

30:13.687 --> 30:15.898
and blew the place apart...

30:15.981 --> 30:19.360
splattered her brains all over the walls.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.695
She was a beautiful girl.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.739
Never knew what hit her.

30:23.823 --> 30:27.493
You oughta heard about that.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.177

- What?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.430
Oh, baby.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.558
Two kids tried to set me on fire.

You want me to call up the doctor?

- Tell me what you want me...
- No, I'm fine.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.123
Are you sure?

31:16.876 --> 31:19.545
So where did you sleep last night?

31:19.628 --> 31:22.173
I stayed at a friend's, Anne.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.512
Okay, Jack. Jack, I want you
to be up front with me now.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.140
If you're seeing somebody else,
just tell me.

You don't have to pour gasoline
all over yourself and light a match...

just to break up with me here.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.105
Just tell me the truth.

31:38.189 --> 31:42.568
Anne, I was not seeing anyone else.
I was... I really was attacked.

Okay.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.338
You don't have to say it back...

32:02.421 --> 32:05.132
although it wouldn't
break your jaw to try.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.721
You know what the Holy Grail is?

32:10.804 --> 32:13.557
Holy Grail?
Yeah, I know that one.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.560
That was like, uh, Jesus' juice glass.

32:16.644 --> 32:18.604
Oh, yeah.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.106
Oh, yeah.
I used to be such a Catholic.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.234
- Do you still believe in God?
- Yeah.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.194
You gotta believe in God.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.364
But I don't believe that God
made men in his image.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.659
Mm-mmm. 'Cause most of the shit
that happens is 'cause of men.

32:31.742 --> 32:35.120
Nah. I think man was made
in the devil's image...

32:35.204 --> 32:37.373
and women were created
out of God...

32:37.456 --> 32:41.085
'cause, after all, women can have babies,
which is kind of like creating...

32:41.168 --> 32:44.880
and which also accounts for the fact
that women are so attracted to men...

32:44.964 --> 32:48.759
'cause let's face it... the devil is
a hell of a lot more interesting.

32:48.842 --> 32:52.054
I've slept with some saints in my day,
and believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.764
Ew. Boring.

So, the whole point of life...
the whole point of life, I think...

32:59.228 --> 33:02.273
is for men and women
to get married...

33:02.356 --> 33:05.401
so that God and the devil
can get together...

33:05.484 --> 33:07.653
and work it out.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.740
Not that we have to get married
or anything.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.159
God forbid.

You have a little... thing right here.

What, a pimple?

Oh, yeah. This stuff is
supposed to blend with my skin.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.466
No. I don't think
I'm up for it tonight, honey.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.387
I just had a very traumatic experience.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.674
- Oh! Gee.
- Can I help you?

35:33.757 --> 35:36.009
I was looking for Parry.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.470
He's not here.

35:38.554 --> 35:42.474
The hospital said it would be best
if we kept certain things away from him.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.769
There. Now, there's his real name.
Henry Sagan.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.938
He was a teacher
over at Hunter College.

35:48.021 --> 35:52.443
They kept him in a mental place
over on Staten Island.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.403
He did not speak for a year.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.822
Then all of a sudden,
he started talking.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.116
Only now he's this Parry guy.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.495
He and his wife used to live upstairs.

36:03.579 --> 36:07.040
When he got released,
they sent him here.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.086
I felt bad.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.922
He couldn't work.
Nobody wanted him.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.009
So I let him stay in the basement.

36:17.092 --> 36:20.512
He helped out.
I'd give him a couple dollars.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.822
- Look, uh, I just wanted to, uh...
- Come on.

39:25.906 --> 39:27.366
[Jack]
I... Oh!

39:27.449 --> 39:29.534
Wait, wait. Look. Look. Hey, look.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.621
I'm leaving. I'm going.
I just wanted to give you...

39:34.331 --> 39:35.332
Shit!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.378
[Parry]
Wait.

39:40.212 --> 39:41.713
Now.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.468
No. Here. Come here.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.011
This way.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.596
Down!

39:52.432 --> 39:54.476
Jack.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.731
She buys a new book
every two days.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.152
[Man] Hey, sweetheart.
What the hell you doing?

40:04.236 --> 40:06.363
- [Gasps]
- She's into trash.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.407
But what are you gonna do?

40:14.246 --> 40:15.747
Jack.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.669
Jack, come here.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.672
Oh.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.674
Oh, she loves dumplings.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.051
- Yeah.
- That's her Wednesday ritual.

40:29.594 --> 40:33.014
Oh, it's so sweet,
how she does that every time.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.599
Oh.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.688
We're looking through the window.
You got a problem with that, buddy?

40:39.771 --> 40:41.815
- I'm looking through the fuckin' window.
- Jack.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.942
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay, okay. Oh.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.153
Sorry. Got it.

40:48.864 --> 40:52.284
If anybody ever told me I'd be in love
with a girl who chews jawbreakers...

40:52.367 --> 40:55.287
I'd say they're nuts...
but look at that jaw.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.872
Oh.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.794
- I'll go.
- There she goes.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.464
Oh. Oh, it's...

41:07.466 --> 41:10.051
- Oh, isn't she...
- You follow her every day, huh?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.263
Oh, it's not like that.
I'm deeply smitten.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.891
- Who is she? What's her name?
- I don't know.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.851
A cooler! Oh.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.396
Oh, that's beautiful.
It needs a little work.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.815
- Here. Come here.
- What? Jack.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.651
I just would like to help you.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.696
Fifty dollars?

41:29.780 --> 41:32.157
All right. All right. Here, look.
Here's another 20.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.243
- Will that do it?
- Seventy dollars. That...

41:36.536 --> 41:39.498
How much is this gonna take?

41:40.832 --> 41:43.585
You're so nice, Jack.
Oh, Jack.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.755
- No, that's okay. It's okay.
- You mensch, you.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.843
That's... Hey, can I
take you to lunch, huh?

41:51.927 --> 41:53.929
No, I got to go back to work.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.349
Take care of yourself.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.779
Sell!

42:10.862 --> 42:12.489
Sell!

42:12.572 --> 42:14.199
- Here.
- Sell!

42:18.036 --> 42:19.371
Take care.

42:19.454 --> 42:23.375
- Buy! Buy! Buy!
- Yes.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.126
- Fuck 'em all!
- [Parry Shouts]

42:25.210 --> 42:27.212
Hey, what are you doing?
Give that back.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.339
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!

42:29.422 --> 42:31.675
What are you doing?
Jack, let go. Let go.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.802
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck were you doing?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.720
Jack! Why did you do that?

42:35.804 --> 42:38.306
- I gave that to <i>you!</i>
- What am I going to do with it?

42:38.390 --> 42:41.142
I don't know, but I gave it to you
to help you, not to help him!

42:41.226 --> 42:44.521
Jack, if you really want to help me...

42:55.532 --> 42:57.492
Okay, you can open your eyes.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.619
Pretty impressive, huh?
[Chuckles]

42:59.703 --> 43:01.162
But don't let it scare you.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.373
As formidable as it seems,
everything has its weakness.

43:03.456 --> 43:04.958
Hey, at least there's no moat.

43:05.041 --> 43:08.211
You can't just break
into Langdon Carmichael's house.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.797
- This man's done nothing.
- Hey! I'll deal with it.

43:10.881 --> 43:12.841
Jack, let's go through this
one more time, okay?

43:12.924 --> 43:15.260
- Look, please, listen to me.
- There is the Holy Grail ins...

43:15.343 --> 43:17.971
Don't start drooling or rolling your eyes
when I tell you this...

43:18.054 --> 43:20.015
but you shouldn't be doing this.

43:20.098 --> 43:24.352
- There is no Holy Grail.
- Oh, Jack, ye of little faith.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.187
Jack, there has to be a grail.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.523
What were the crusades,
the pope's publicity stunt?

43:28.607 --> 43:30.775
Oh, you heathen, there's a grail.
Come on.

43:30.859 --> 43:32.777
Hey. Look, wait. Wait a minute. Look.

43:32.861 --> 43:34.362
[Parry]
Hey! [Laughs]

43:34.446 --> 43:38.909
You're only partly insane.
People like you can lead semi-normal lives.

43:38.992 --> 43:41.703
- You can get a job.
- I have a job, Jack.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.997
I have a quest.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.583
I take it back.
You're fucking deranged.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.960
You're gonna get yourself killed
trying to get in there.

43:50.045 --> 43:52.005
That's so sweet.

43:52.088 --> 43:55.050
Now, I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to protect me, aren't you?

43:55.133 --> 43:57.886
- You think there's danger in there.
- No. I think you're a moron.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.971
And I don't want to get in trouble.

44:01.181 --> 44:04.225
You care.
First the money, now this.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.312
Oh, that's so sweet.
Oh, you fabulous guy!

44:08.480 --> 44:10.565
Don't hug me in public again.
Okay?

44:10.649 --> 44:12.567
Oh, men with men. Oh, Jack.

44:12.651 --> 44:15.403
I love this guy!

44:15.487 --> 44:18.907
You hear me? I love this guy!

44:18.990 --> 44:20.909
Oh, you hear me, jaded city?

44:20.992 --> 44:23.912
- Will you shut up!
- I love Jack. He cares.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.748
Oh, Jack, in this jaded
motherfuckin' city...

44:26.831 --> 44:28.917
Will you... Will you shut up!

44:29.000 --> 44:31.169
You hear me?
I'm loopy about this guy.

44:31.252 --> 44:35.340
Oh, Jack!
Oh, you're a real human being.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.760
You're a friend, a true friend.

44:39.761 --> 44:41.721
I'm not. Believe me.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.308
- I'm scum.
- Come on.

44:45.392 --> 44:48.061
I'm not going to listen.
You're an honest-to-goodness good guy.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.146
I'm self-centered. I'm weak.

44:51.231 --> 44:53.441
I don't have the willpower
of a fly on shit.

44:53.525 --> 44:55.110
Maybe that's why
the little people sent you.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.112
They knew that.
It's like magic.

44:57.195 --> 45:00.323
I don't believe
in little floating people, okay?

45:00.407 --> 45:02.534
There is no magic.

45:03.535 --> 45:06.204
But you're still gonna help me, Jack.
That's what matters.

45:06.287 --> 45:09.082
- Parry. Parry, or whatever your name is...
- Jack. Jack.

45:09.165 --> 45:11.376
You know none of this is true.
The grail, the voices.

45:11.459 --> 45:14.337
There's a part of you
that knows it's not true.

45:14.421 --> 45:16.798
- I think we have to start planning now.
- Parry, listen to me.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.968
Jack. Jack. You're acting weird, Jack.

45:21.094 --> 45:24.723
- I know who you are. You're a...
- Jack!

45:24.806 --> 45:27.100
- Let go of me, Jack!
- You used to teach at Hunter College.

45:27.183 --> 45:29.853
- No! No!
- Parry, you're a teacher.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.231
- Parry!
- [Screaming]

45:33.314 --> 45:34.816
No!

45:35.608 --> 45:40.739
[Shouts, Whimpers]

45:44.451 --> 45:47.162
- Parry! Parry!
- [Shrieking]

45:52.459 --> 45:54.502
What are you looking at?

45:54.586 --> 45:56.337
[Whimpering]

45:56.421 --> 45:59.758
- Parry.
- No! No!

46:00.925 --> 46:02.886
- What?
- Jack. Jack.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.101
He's afraid of you.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.856
We've got him! Come on!

46:14.939 --> 46:18.234
- [Horn Honks]
- Parry! Parry! Parry!

46:19.277 --> 46:20.945
Holy shit!

46:21.029 --> 46:22.238
Parry!

46:24.115 --> 46:28.036
Parry!

46:30.872 --> 46:32.123
Parry!

46:37.337 --> 46:39.881
Hey! Parry!

46:39.964 --> 46:42.008
Parry. Parry!

46:42.092 --> 46:44.427
I got him, Jack!

46:53.061 --> 46:54.562
Ah!

47:06.282 --> 47:08.660
- Parry!
- [Gasps]

47:10.370 --> 47:11.871
Yes!

47:20.088 --> 47:21.256
Oh!

47:23.216 --> 47:25.552
I got you, you medieval alien!

47:32.433 --> 47:34.018
[Gasps]

[Shouts]

47:55.665 --> 47:57.625
[Jack Panting]

47:57.709 --> 47:59.919
I'm dying.

48:00.003 --> 48:02.338
I can't breathe.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.050
Isn't this a beautiful spot, Jack?

48:06.926 --> 48:09.721
Who... Who have we been chasing?

48:09.804 --> 48:11.723
Can I ask this question now?

48:12.807 --> 48:14.809
He's gone now.

48:14.893 --> 48:17.020
Oh, we had him on the run, didn't we?

48:17.103 --> 48:19.856
Oh, if we had horses,
we'd have had his ass. Ooh, boy.

48:19.939 --> 48:21.566
- Who?
- What?

48:24.235 --> 48:26.529
Who have we been chasing?

48:26.613 --> 48:28.364
Jack, I thought you saw him.

48:28.448 --> 48:29.991
Saw who?

48:30.074 --> 48:31.826
The Red Knight.

48:33.036 --> 48:34.913
Okay.

48:37.707 --> 48:41.669
I gave you the money.
You want to keep it, fine.

48:41.753 --> 48:43.588
You want to give it away, fine.

48:45.173 --> 48:48.343
I just want you to know
I did give him the money. Okay?

48:48.426 --> 48:51.095
Are we clear?

48:51.179 --> 48:53.056
[Sighs]

48:53.139 --> 48:55.683
Who are you talking to, Jack?

48:57.602 --> 49:01.606
[Man, High Voice]
Help me, somebody, please!

49:01.689 --> 49:03.816
Heaven be praised in giving so soon
an opportunity for me...

49:03.900 --> 49:05.693
to fulfill the duties of my profession.

49:05.777 --> 49:08.446
[Man]
No! Help me!

49:08.529 --> 49:10.531
These cries doubtless proceed
from some miserable male or female...

49:10.615 --> 49:12.575
in need of my immediate
aid and protection.

49:12.659 --> 49:15.620
- Jack. I gotta go.
- This is too hard.

49:16.621 --> 49:19.165
- Help me!
- [Jack] Will you stop!

49:19.249 --> 49:22.752
Will you, lady on the horse,
please trample me?

49:22.835 --> 49:25.213
- What are you... What are you...
- Over here!

49:25.296 --> 49:26.673
[Horse Whinnies]

49:26.756 --> 49:29.217
- No! No! Get away from me!
- Jack, please.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.636
- Get away, please!
- I'm not going to hurt you.

49:31.719 --> 49:34.389
- I'm not going to hurt you!
- That's what the other guy said.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.058
- Leave me alone, please!
- Please, I want to help you.

49:37.141 --> 49:40.311
No. I want to go!
Please, let me go now.

49:40.395 --> 49:43.898
Scarecrow, they knocked the stuffing...
Come on. Let me help you up.

49:43.982 --> 49:47.235
No. I want a debutante on a horse
to step on me, please.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.904
- Parry.
- Leave me alone.

49:49.988 --> 49:52.740
Sorry to tell you this,
but the days of debutantes are over.

49:52.824 --> 49:54.742
And isn't it awful?

49:54.826 --> 49:56.869
Poor little Gloria.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.955
Poor Brenda Frazier.

49:59.038 --> 50:02.417
They ruined them.
They ate 'em alive.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.836
Yeah, but what about Slim Keith,
that little Guggenheim girl?

50:04.919 --> 50:08.298
Impostors! Leave me alone!

50:08.381 --> 50:11.592
- Jack, come on. Lend a hand.
- Listen, he just needs to sleep it off.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.470
- Somebody will take care of him.
- Who, Mother Teresa? She's retired.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.347
Come on. It's just us. Let's go.

50:16.431 --> 50:18.766
Maybe he wants to stay here.
Do you want to stay here?

50:18.850 --> 50:22.270
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll just love bleeding in horseshit.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.772
How very Gandhi-esque of you.

50:26.024 --> 50:27.358
Jack?

50:27.442 --> 50:29.360
Get out of the way.

<i>[Woman On PA]

50:35.074 --> 50:38.411
[Man] No, please.
Please, I was born in a place like this.

50:38.494 --> 50:40.163
I don't want to be here.

50:40.246 --> 50:43.124
- Please, let me... Please.
- Come on.

50:43.207 --> 50:45.418
Jack, take care of him.

50:45.501 --> 50:48.546
No, no, no, no, no! I want to go.
Please, let me go.

50:48.629 --> 50:50.506
Where? Where do you want to go?

50:50.590 --> 50:53.593
To a nice place that I know about.

50:53.676 --> 50:57.138
- Well, maybe we can go there later.
- We can't go there tonight.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.140
Maybe we can.
Where do you want to go?

50:59.223 --> 51:02.685
We can't. No, we can't.
[Sobbing]

51:07.648 --> 51:11.361
Hey, come on. Maybe we can.
Where do you want to go?

51:11.444 --> 51:12.945
Venice.

51:13.905 --> 51:17.325
Like Katharine Hepburn
in <i>Summertime.</i>

51:17.408 --> 51:21.412
Why can't I be Katharine Hepburn?

51:21.496 --> 51:23.831

I don't know what to do with the children,

51:51.567 --> 51:53.986
That's wonderful feeling,
but you're stretching.

51:54.070 --> 51:56.864
Come on, tempo.
Allegro, people, allegro.

51:56.948 --> 51:58.116
Okay.

51:58.199 --> 52:00.535
When you, uh...

52:03.246 --> 52:08.042
Did you lose your mind all of a sudden,
or was it a slow, gradual process?

52:10.837 --> 52:12.338
Well...

52:13.548 --> 52:16.551
I'm a singer by trade.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.554
Summer stock, nightclub revues.
That sort of thing.

52:19.637 --> 52:23.349
And God, I absolutely lived for it.

52:23.433 --> 52:25.852
I can do <i>Gypsy...</i> every part.

52:25.935 --> 52:27.478
I can do it backwards.

52:27.562 --> 52:30.523
But then one night, right in the middle
of singing # Funny #...

52:30.606 --> 52:32.567
suddenly it hit me...

52:32.650 --> 52:35.236
What does all this mean?

52:35.319 --> 52:39.157
I mean, that plus the fact
that I'd watched all my friends die.

52:43.119 --> 52:45.746
Sound like a veteran, don't I?
[Laughs]

52:45.830 --> 52:47.748
- Fuck off!

53:29.665 --> 53:33.419
Parry? Did you hear Jimmy Nichols
got picked up yesterday?

53:37.840 --> 53:39.467
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

53:39.550 --> 53:42.053
He got caught pissing on a bookstore.

53:42.136 --> 53:43.846
Man's a pig.

53:43.930 --> 53:47.099
No excuse for that.
Thank you, babe.

53:47.183 --> 53:51.354
We're headed for social anarchy
when people start pissing on bookstores.

53:51.437 --> 53:52.688
Ah.

53:53.606 --> 53:56.901
Asshole.
Didn't even look at you.

53:56.984 --> 54:00.571
Well, he's paying
so he don't have to look.

54:02.907 --> 54:07.411
Say, guy goes to work every day
eight hours a day, seven days a week.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.372
He gets his nuts so tight in a vise...

54:09.455 --> 54:13.543
that he starts questioning
the very fabric of his existence.

54:14.418 --> 54:17.672
Then one day, about quitting time,
the boss calls him into the office...

54:17.755 --> 54:20.633
and says, "Hey, Bob,
why don't you come on in here...

54:20.716 --> 54:23.594
and kiss my ass for me, will you?"

54:23.678 --> 54:26.681
Well, he says, "Hell with it.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.766
I don't care what happens.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.186
I just want to see
the expression on his face...

as I jam this pair of scissors
into his arm <i>."</i>

54:37.441 --> 54:40.111
[Sighs]
Then he thinks of me.

54:41.279 --> 54:43.114
He says, "Wait a minute.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.449
I got both my arms,
I got both my legs.

54:45.533 --> 54:47.868
At least I'm not begging
for a living <i>."</i>

54:49.662 --> 54:51.872
Sure enough, Bob's gonna
put those scissors down...

54:51.956 --> 54:53.708
and pucker right up.

54:54.333 --> 54:58.379
You see, I'm what you call

Hey, don't you think
it's time to go now?

58:14.325 --> 58:16.243
Running around here during the day
is one thing...

58:16.327 --> 58:19.455
but at night we could be killed
by a wide variety of people.

58:19.538 --> 58:21.540
That's stupid, Jack.

that they can keep us out...

58:28.172 --> 58:30.132
'cause they make us think
we might get killed or something?

58:30.216 --> 58:32.426
- Yes, I think it's very fair.
- Well, I don't.

58:32.510 --> 58:35.262
- What are you doing?
- I'm cloud busting, Jack.

58:35.346 --> 58:38.808
You ever done it? You lie on your back

58:38.891 --> 58:40.893

- But you have to be nude though, Jack.
- You can't do this.

I hate it when they use

It's so insinuating.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:32.129
Jack, I may be going out on a limb here,
but you don't seem like a happy camper.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.470
Did you ever hear the story
of the Fisher King?

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.055
No.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.726
It begins with the king as a boy...

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.561
having to spend the night
alone in the forest...

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.064
to prove his courage
so he can become king.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.860
While he's spending the night alone...

01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:57.696
he's visited by a sacred vision.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.575
Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail...

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.328
the symbol of God's divine grace.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:08.832
And a voice said to the boy,
"You shall be keeper of the grail...

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:11.418
so that it may heal the hearts of men."

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.130
But the boy was blinded
by greater visions...

01:01:15.214 --> 01:01:18.676
of a life filled with power
and glory and beauty.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.306
In this state of radical amazement...

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:27.601
he felt, for a brief moment,
not like a boy...

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:30.104
but invincible...

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.897
like God.

01:01:31.981 --> 01:01:34.483
So he reached in the fire
to take the grail...

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:38.278
and the grail vanished...

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.699
leaving him with his hand in the fire
to be terribly wounded.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.619
Now, as this boy grew older...

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:48.789
his wound grew deeper...

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.959
until one day...

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.253
life for him lost its reason.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.424
He had no faith in any man,
not even himself.

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.468
He couldn't love...

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.012
or feel loved.

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:04.972
He was sick with experience.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:07.516
He began to die.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.895
One day,
a fool wandered into the castle...

01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:13.981
and found the king alone.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.234
Now, being a fool,
he was simpleminded.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.153
He didn't see a king.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:22.489
He only saw a man alone
and in pain.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:26.827
And he asked the king,
"What ails you, friend?"

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.496
The king replied, "I'm thirsty.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.207
I need some water
to cool my throat."

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:39.631
So the fool took a cup
from beside his bed, filled it with water...

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.342
and handed it to the king.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.678
And as the king began to drink...

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:47.306
he realized his wound was healed.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.893
He looked in his hands,
and there was the Holy Grail...

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.270
that which he sought all of his life.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.230
He turned to the fool
and said with amazement...

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:58.942
"How could you find that which
my brightest and bravest could not?"

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:03.614
The fool replied, "I don't know.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.410
I only knew that you were thirsty."

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.456
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.047
I think I heard that at a lecture once.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.257
I don't know.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.094
It was, um...

01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:26.678
a professor.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.307
It's... At Hunter.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:34.895

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:37.731

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:44.655

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.450
- Hey. Parry.

asked that girl for a date, huh?

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.920
I can't ask her.
I have to earn her, Jack.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:04.007
Oh, come on now. This is the 20th century.
You don't have to earn a woman.

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:06.218
Well, maybe after we get the grail.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.637
No, but, see,
she could help you get the grail.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.681
You know, I mean, women are great.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:15.936
They make homes
and they kill the livestock...

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.605

and get grails...

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.858

with a clear head, huh?

without Guinevere, huh?

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:27.072

That's a bad example.

01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:32.452

- [Fork Drops On Floor]
- Oh. Clumsy <i>moi.</i>

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.437
Thank you!

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:36.444
I mean, I've gone out with some bums
in my day, but they were beautiful.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:39.197
That is the only reason
to go out with a bum.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.241
This food is delicious, Anne.
Really.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:46.245
You're a wonderful cook,
and you have a great set of... dishes.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:49.499
Jack. He's trying
to start a conversation.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:52.251
Well, talk to him.
He's not going to bite you.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.672
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:59.467
You know,
you are a beautiful woman.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.427
You've got your own business.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:05.348
I am surprised some guy doesn't
just snatch you up all for his own.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.141
Oh, <i>you're</i> surprised?

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:11.521
Guess I just never met the right guy.
What are you gonna do?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:14.607
You know, I'm shocked.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:17.360
I mean, a childbearing body like yours.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.989
Well, I mean, a guy would
have to be out of his mind.

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:22.657
Most guys are.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.828
- No.
- Hmph.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:31.791
You, this incredible woman,
going to waste before my very eyes?

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:34.794
No! This is outrageous!

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:37.672
I will not hear this.
No! No! Come on!

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.633
- Jack, get over here.
- I am your man then.

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:42.885
Let's do it right here!

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:46.264
Let's go to that place of splendor
in the grass!

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:47.640
- Behold my magic wand.
- Jack.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:49.517
- And free your golden orbs right now.
- Jack, get over here.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.519
- You know what I'm saying. Yes.
- What are you?

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.646
- # Holding my penis #
- Out of your mind?

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.273
- # What a wonderful way #
- Close that... Jack!

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:56.441
- # Of saying how much you like... #
- Jack!

01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:58.943
- Parry, close your pants.
- Took you long enough.

01:18:59.027 --> 01:19:02.488
- What are you? About a 40 in a jacket?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.198
This is gonna work.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:13.541
You let me know, 'cause you're
too good a woman to go to waste.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.838
Oh.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.726
[Bell Rings]

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.394
[Buzzer Sounds]

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:39.192
Oh. Welcome.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.110
Come in.

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:47.408
I've never been in an apartment
above a store before.

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:50.161
You always walk past them
on the streets when you walk by...

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:53.331
but you never really think
anyone really lives in them.

01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:03.800
Can I get you something?
A little coffee?

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.384
- A little tea?
- No.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.261
- A little tequila?
- Nope.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.025
Will it h-hurt?

01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:23.611
That all depends on you.

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:26.447
You sure you don't want a drink?

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:31.160
- Yes. Just enjoy this. That-a-boy.
- [Chuckling]

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.247
- This is mud.
- We just washed that off.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.375
- This is gonna make you look great.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.918
It's good mud.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.420
- Shh.
- Shh! Shh.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.798
- Close...
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.508
- Lips.
- Mmm.

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:49.428
[Chuckles]
Ner...

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:51.931
- Close.
- What are you doing?

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.683
Hmm?

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:55.351
There we go.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:58.020
Now, you just relax.

01:20:58.104 --> 01:20:59.438
[Chuckles]

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:03.609
So, anybody special in your life?

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:07.029
Does it look like there's
anybody special in my life?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.575
Well, you don't have to say it like that.

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:14.662
It's not so, you know, crazy an idea.
You're a healthy woman.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:17.456
You have a steady job.
You're not cross-eyed or anything.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.917
Nope, there is nobody special.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:21.836
Okay. Fine.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.967
I mean, it's... it's not easy
in this day and age.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.635
What's not easy?

01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:34.015
- Meeting people.
- Oh, God. Tell me about it.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.851
I've been dating
longer than I've been driving.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.728
I can't believe that.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.980
I...

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:45.818
I have never been through
a dating period.

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:48.404
It's a disgusting process.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:51.324
You haven't missed a thing.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:54.577
- Hold still.
- I'm so excited.

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:59.749
I mean, did you feel like this
when you first met Anne? Huh?

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:02.668
Because she's a wonderful woman.
She loves you too much, Jack.

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:05.463
Ah, but you love her too.
Don't you?

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:09.967
You know you do. It's just that you're
a little bit of an asshole sometimes.

01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:11.636
Sorry.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.015
Thanks.

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:17.516
[Jack Grunts]

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.021
My mother calls me once a week
like an ongoing nightmare.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.023
"So, have you met anyone?"
"No, Mom."

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.359
"So, what's going to happen?"
"I don't know, Mom."

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.528
Thank <i>God</i>
I moved out of that house.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:32.657
I cannot believe that you lived with her
as long as you did.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.202
If I had to live with my mother,
I would stab myself six times.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:42.625
I think some people
are meant to be alone.

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:48.172
This is my idea, that I...
I was born a man in a former life...

01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:51.217
and I used women for pleasure...

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.843
so now...

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.721
I'm paying for it.

01:22:56.597 --> 01:23:01.269
I wouldn't mind so much if I could
just remember the pleasure parts.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:05.564
I think you're getting
a little too complicated.

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:09.777
What, in your opinion,
is the actual problem?

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.488
I don't make an impression on people.

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:18.160
At office parties,
I rearrange the hors d'oeuvres...

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:19.870
while people are eating them...

01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:22.581
so that the platters will remain full.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:26.669
I never start any of the conversations
because I just don't know...

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:32.258
[Sighs] I don't know
where to make it end, to go...

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:33.801
Listen, listen, listen.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:37.221
You gotta be a little easier
on yourself, doll.

01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:41.183
A conversation has a life
of its own. You know?

01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:43.853
You have to have some faith
in that fact.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:46.105
I mean, look at us.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:47.815
We're having...

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:52.111
a very lovely conversation.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.696
I'm paying you.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:58.284
Oh, look, will you stop it?
I'm not like that. I don't do people favors.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.745
If I talk to you,
it's because I want to talk to you.

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:03.789
All right, you're not a supermodel.
We can't all be Jerry Hall.

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:07.209
What a boring world it would be
if we were all Jerry Hall.

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:09.837
You do the best you can
with what you got.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.964
You're not so invisible.

01:24:12.048 --> 01:24:14.300
Hey, you want a personality?

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.385
Try this on for size.

01:24:16.469 --> 01:24:19.263
You can be a real bitch.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:29.815
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.572
Really?
[Laughing]

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.742
[Both Laughing]

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:47.500
I'm going to give you my wallet
so you can pay for dinner. Okay?

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.960
You're a nice man, Jack,
doing all this for me.

01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:52.380
Come on. Hmm?

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:54.673
- I'm scared.
- No, no, no, no.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.967
I mean, I feel so much for her.

01:24:57.051 --> 01:24:59.178
I feel like something awful's
gonna happen.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.971
- Nothing awful is gonna happen.
- No?

01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:03.724
No, no, no.
Anne is gonna be there.

01:25:03.808 --> 01:25:06.727
I'm gonna be there.
Nothing awful's gonna happen.

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:08.896
- Okay?
- I'm still scared.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:11.524
- I know. It's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:12.691
- Okay.
- All right.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.027
- You're looking good.
- You too. [Chuckles]

01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:16.612
Just remember to breathe.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.531
- Okay, I gotta breathe.
- Big breath.

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:24.829
[Both Laughing, Cackling]

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:26.789
[Jack]
Anne? Anne.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.416
Anne!

01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:30.584
- Oh! Oh!
- [Lydia Gasps]

01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:32.878
- Please. No, stay.
- [Jack] Look! Lydia. How you doing?

01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:35.381
Look, Parry. It's Lydia Sinclair,
our membership winner.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.715
- I know.
- [Lydia Chuckles]

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:40.219
- So, what have you fellas been up to?
- Well, everything's locked up downstairs.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.805
- We thought we'd get some dinner.
- Oh.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:46.559
J... Ow! Jack!
[Groaning]

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.894
Say, anybody up for Chinese?

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:51.689
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Have you eaten? Would you like to join us?

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.400
- Uh, no, thank you.
- Watch your nails!

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.360
- I'd rather go home.
- Me too.

01:25:56.444 --> 01:25:58.654
No, Parry.
Parry, Parry, Parry, come on.

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.574
- Come on. You still have to eat.
- No, I'd like to go now.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.075
- Don't blow this.
- Jack, please.

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:04.410
Hey.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:07.288
- I'd rather go home.
- What did I tell you? It's only dinner.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:09.915
Okay? Come on.
You're gonna do this.

01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:12.084
You'll have something to tell your mother
the next time she calls.

01:26:12.168 --> 01:26:14.420
- I don't give a flying...
- You are coming!

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.757
[All]
Fine.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.889
[Parry]
What do you do?

01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:28.100
[Lydia] Well, I get to read
the books sometimes.

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:31.770
- But mostly I calculate production costs...
- Parry.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:34.356
- [Bottle Clatters]
- from...

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:38.319
Calculation costs from...

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.321
first-edition hardcover to...

01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:42.239
- Sorry. Softcover.
- Oh.

01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:45.117
And after softcover, it's basically
somebody else's problem then.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:47.328
Boy, that sounds real exciting.

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:50.456
Why does it sound exciting?
It's not exciting at all.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.166
Why not?
[Stammers]

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:56.629
I mean, y-y-your calculations determine
whether a book is published or not.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.464
It, um, you know...

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:02.968
Maybe it's a book that changes
the way people think or, you know, act.

01:27:03.052 --> 01:27:07.348
Yeah, but what we publish
is mostly trashy romance novels.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:08.933
Don't say that.

01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:11.227
There's nothing trashy
about romance.

01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:15.689
In romance, there's passion...

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.943
there's imagination...

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:20.611
there's beauty.

01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:24.365
Besides, you...

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:28.410
you find some pretty wonderful things
in the trash.

01:27:40.005 --> 01:27:41.674
[Anne]
Ooh, dumplings.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.759
I could eat all of these.

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:47.388
[Jack]
Lydia, would you like a dumpling?

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.766
- Some tea?

Uh...

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:51.660
H-Help her with that.

# For a dime,
you can see Kankakee or <i>Paris #</i>

hanging down her head.

Come on.

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.857
And then they started in
on the dumplings.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.485
They were playing hockey
with the dumpling on the table.

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:32.488
- It was broccoli. Broccoli!
- No, it was a dumpling.

[Jack Cackles]

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:36.867

Oh, God.
Stop, or I'm gonna lose it right here.

01:31:38.638 --> 01:31:39.828
No, wait, the burping.

[Biker]
Yo, Lydia!

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:47.753
Watch out! Hey!

01:31:50.798 --> 01:31:54.092
Tell me more about yourself.
I'd like to know everything.

01:31:54.176 --> 01:31:56.428
Well, th-there's nothing more to tell.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.096
Oh, don't say that.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.641
- No, that's it.
- It's enough for me.

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:03.602
- I really think she went for him.
- Oh, I know.

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.604

01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:11.276
It's Latin.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.695
It means "Love conquers all."

01:32:13.779 --> 01:32:15.781
I don't mean us.
I don't mean us.

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:17.491
I mean everybody else.

Mmm.
God, you think it'll work out?

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:23.080
Who knows? Who knows?

01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:25.082
Two people could be at a party together...

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.292
sitting right across from each other,
and never find each other.

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:30.629
Another two people could be
on opposite sides of the world...

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.881
and nothing could keep them apart.

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:34.758
Who knows?

01:32:34.842 --> 01:32:37.928
The thing is,
if a thing is meant to happen...

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:44.977
- What?
- Nothing.

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.229
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:51.066
You must be very proud of yourself.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:55.153
You did a great thing
for somebody tonight.

01:32:57.447 --> 01:33:00.409
I was very proud to be with you tonight.

01:33:02.119 --> 01:33:03.912
You were great.

01:33:05.247 --> 01:33:06.874
Thank you.

01:33:19.386 --> 01:33:21.263
You're welcome.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:38.030
You don't have to say that.

01:33:38.113 --> 01:33:40.032
I never say anything I have to.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.994
No, I mean, you don't have to
say nice things to me.

01:33:44.077 --> 01:33:46.997
It's a little old-fashioned,
considering what we're about to do.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.665
What are we about to do?

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:50.751
- You're walking me home.
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:55.005
- I think you're a little attracted to me.
- [Man Shouts, Faint]

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:57.215
- Yeah.
- And...

01:34:00.093 --> 01:34:04.348
[Sighs] You'll probably want to
come upstairs for some coffee.

01:34:04.431 --> 01:34:06.475
I don't drink coffee.

01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:09.394
And we'll probably
have a drink and talk...

01:34:09.478 --> 01:34:11.897
and get to know each other
a little bit better.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.482
Get comfortable.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:15.692
And then you'll...

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:22.950
you'll sleep over.

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:26.119
And in the morning, you'll awake...

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.997
and you'll be distant.

01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:33.835
And you won't be able
to stay for breakfast.

01:34:33.919 --> 01:34:35.963
Maybe just a cup of coffee.

01:34:36.046 --> 01:34:37.881
I don't drink coffee.

01:34:37.965 --> 01:34:41.927
And then we'll exchange
phone numbers...

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.762
and you'll leave...

01:34:46.306 --> 01:34:47.975
and never call.

01:34:49.685 --> 01:34:52.771
And I'll go to work
and I'll feel so good...

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:54.439
for the first hour...

01:34:54.523 --> 01:34:56.108
and then...

01:34:56.191 --> 01:35:00.195
ever so slowly,
I'll turn into a piece of dirt.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:09.371
I don't know why
I'm putting myself through this.

01:35:15.544 --> 01:35:18.213
It was really nice to meet you.

01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:22.050
Night.

01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:23.719
[Parry]
Night.

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:26.722
[Stammers]
Excuse me!

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:29.057
Wait. Just... Hey!

01:35:29.141 --> 01:35:31.393
Sorry. Wait one minute.
Hey. Excuse me.

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:32.978
Please wait. Wait.

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:35.647
- No, listen. I'm not feeling very well.
- No wonder.

01:35:35.731 --> 01:35:40.068
We just met, made love and broke up,
all in the space of 30 seconds.

01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:43.572
And I don't remember having the first kiss,
which I think is the best part.

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:46.575
- Listen, it was so very special to meet you...
- It was for me too.

01:35:46.658 --> 01:35:49.703
- I had such a wonderful evening...
- But I think it's time you should shut up now.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:52.164
Shut up. Please?

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:58.378
I'm not coming up
to your apartment.

01:35:58.462 --> 01:36:00.881
That was never my intention.

01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:03.216
Oh. God. You don't want to.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.843
Oh, no, I want to!

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:08.013
I have a hard-on for you
the size of Florida.

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:12.851
But I don't want just one night.

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:17.606
I have a confession
I have to make to you.

01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:18.857
- You're married?
- No.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.817
- You're divorced?
- No.

01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:23.236
- Do you have a disease?
- No. Please stop.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.909
I'm in love with you.

01:36:31.578 --> 01:36:33.080
Shh-shh-shh.

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.792
Not just from tonight.

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.294
I've known you for a long time.

01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:43.423
I know that you come out
from work at noon every day.

01:36:43.507 --> 01:36:46.301
You fight your way out that door,
then you get pushed back in...

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.595
and three seconds later
you come back out again.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:51.473
And I walk with you to lunch,
and I know if it's a good day...

01:36:51.556 --> 01:36:54.392
if you stop and get that romance novel
at that bookstore.

01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:58.355
I know what you order, and I know
on Wednesdays you go to that dim sum parlor.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:02.609
And I know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back in to work.

01:37:04.653 --> 01:37:08.949
And I know you hate your job
and you don't have many friends.

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:11.827
And I know sometimes
you feel a little uncoordinated...

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:15.539
and you don't feel as wonderful
as everybody else...

01:37:15.622 --> 01:37:19.167
feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are.

01:37:20.502 --> 01:37:22.129
I love you.

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:28.927
I love you.
[Chuckles]

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:32.347
And I think you're the greatest thing
since spice racks.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:35.767
And I'd be knocked out several times
if I could just have that first kiss.

01:37:35.851 --> 01:37:38.436
And I won't... I won't be distant.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:41.815
I'll come back in the morning,
and I'll call you, if you let me.

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:46.278
But I still don't drink coffee.

It's the wrong door.

01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:31.740
You can call me.

01:38:35.869 --> 01:38:38.580

01:42:28.643 --> 01:42:31.688
Yeah, well, I... [Clears Throat]
I had those personal problems to work out.

01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:35.358

I want to get back to work.

01:42:58.006 --> 01:42:59.924
Tuesday is fine.

01:43:00.008 --> 01:43:02.594
Tuesday is great, Lou.
All right. I'll see you then.

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:05.305

01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:06.890

01:43:06.973 --> 01:43:08.933

- You're kidding.

01:43:09.017 --> 01:43:12.020
- I called my agent.
- What did he say?

01:43:12.854 --> 01:43:16.107
He says that if I want to
get back to work, no problem...

01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:18.485
that I just come in and, uh...

01:43:19.611 --> 01:43:21.488
we talk and that's it.

01:43:21.571 --> 01:43:23.448
Oh, baby!

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:25.408

You seen my jacket?

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.622
- It's in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom.

I got the coffee here if you want it.

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.584

01:43:34.667 --> 01:43:38.338

Now that there's going to be
another income coming in...

I would love to look
for a bigger place.

01:43:52.602 --> 01:43:55.021
I mean, I don't want to rush anything...

01:43:55.104 --> 01:43:57.148
but I'd like to start looking anyway.

01:43:57.232 --> 01:43:59.526
You know? Maybe a two-bedroom?

01:43:59.609 --> 01:44:02.612
Or maybe even
the top floor of a house?

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:05.990

- Come here.

- What's this, a death sentence?
- No, no. I want to talk about this.

So much has happened...

01:44:30.265 --> 01:44:33.351
that I think it would be
a good thing for both of us...

01:44:34.102 --> 01:44:35.645
if we...

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:39.023
slowed down a little.

01:44:39.107 --> 01:44:42.026
Slowed down? Where have I been?
Have we been going fast here?

01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:44.028
Come on, Anne,
now, look, this has been...

01:44:44.112 --> 01:44:47.282
a real, real difficult time
for me this past year or so.

01:44:47.365 --> 01:44:48.950
Yeah?

01:44:49.742 --> 01:44:52.704
And, uh, you know, I feel like
I'm above water for the first time.

01:44:52.787 --> 01:44:57.125
I feel I know a lot more now,
and I don't want to make any more mistakes.

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:59.210
- So?
- I think I need time to...

01:45:00.253 --> 01:45:02.046
make the right choices, to, uh...

01:45:02.130 --> 01:45:04.340
W-Wait, wait, wait. I'm lost here.

01:45:04.424 --> 01:45:08.428
- What are you saying?
- I think maybe I should be alone for a while.

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:13.391
You know, now that
I know more, you know...

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.143
I-I feel that, uh...

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:20.231
I should focus on my career now that I can,
now that everything's taken care of.

01:45:20.315 --> 01:45:22.400
- You know, Parry's, uh...
- All right, first of all...

01:45:22.483 --> 01:45:25.069
Let me just say one thing, okay?

01:45:25.153 --> 01:45:28.364
You don't know shit. Okay?

01:45:29.115 --> 01:45:31.951
Secondly, as far as we go...

01:45:32.035 --> 01:45:35.246
what have we been doing here
except time?

01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:39.000
Have I... Have I ever pressured you?
Once? Ever?

01:45:39.083 --> 01:45:40.335
- No.
- No.

01:45:40.418 --> 01:45:43.379
So what time do you need, baby?

01:45:43.463 --> 01:45:46.257
I love you. You love me.

01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:47.640
You want to get your career going?

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.636
I think that's the greatest
thing in the world.

01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:53.514
I want to be there when... I'm sorry.
I want to be there when it happens.

01:45:54.349 --> 01:45:57.602
So wh-what do you need time
to figure out? Huh?

01:46:00.355 --> 01:46:04.025
All right, I-let me...
let me just ask you one thing.

01:46:05.652 --> 01:46:07.278
Do you love me?

01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:11.699
I don't know.

01:46:15.495 --> 01:46:17.830
You can't even give me that, can you?

01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:22.210
Jesus, Jack!
What were you planning on doing here?

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:24.712
Were you planning on just packing up
your things, walking out the door...

01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:27.215
and dropping me a note
when you meet somebody new?

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:30.218
I had no idea what I was planning to do.
I just said I need time.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.803
Bullshit!

01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:33.805
If you're gonna hurt me, hurt me now...

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:36.432
not some long, drawn-out hurt
that takes months of my life...

01:46:36.516 --> 01:46:39.060
because you don't have the balls!

01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:43.898
Okay. I'll pack my stuff tonight.

01:46:45.108 --> 01:46:48.027
Um, what have you been doing here?
Could you just tell me that?

01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:50.321
What have you been doing here?

01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:53.074
- We both got something out of this...
- What did I get?

01:46:53.157 --> 01:46:55.034
What did I get?

01:46:55.118 --> 01:46:58.204
What did I get I couldn't have gotten
from anybody with no name...

01:46:58.287 --> 01:47:00.164
any night of the week?

01:47:00.248 --> 01:47:02.667
Do you think your company
is such a treat?

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:05.091
Your moods, your pain, your problems?

01:47:05.291 --> 01:47:07.130
Do you think this has
been entertaining for me?

01:47:07.213 --> 01:47:09.382
Then what do you want to
stay with me for?

01:47:12.135 --> 01:47:15.263
Because I love you.

01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:19.434

Don't. Don't. No.

01:47:42.832 --> 01:47:45.001
You don't get to be nice!

01:47:46.586 --> 01:47:48.880
I'm not going to play
some stupid game with you...

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:50.882

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:53.468

feeling good about yourself.

01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:55.803

let's just call it over.

01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:55.196
Parry?

01:48:55.279 --> 01:48:57.031
He can't hear you.

01:48:58.366 --> 01:49:01.869
I'm Dr. Manderville.
I was on duty when they brought him in.

01:49:03.704 --> 01:49:06.958
I've been going over his record.
He was brought in once before, I understand.

01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:10.628
Catatonic stupor.
Condition rendered him nonverbal.

01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:15.216
Yeah, yeah. So the guy, he's been beat up.
He's got a concussion, right? He's...

01:49:16.092 --> 01:49:18.344
Right?
He's gonna snap out of it.

01:49:18.427 --> 01:49:20.388
I'm afraid not.

01:49:21.055 --> 01:49:23.641
See, the beating's bad,
but it's not the problem.

01:49:23.724 --> 01:49:26.143
He seems to be
reexperiencing the catatonia.

01:49:26.227 --> 01:49:28.646
So like before, he could
snap out of it in an hour...

01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:31.399
or 13 months, or 13 years.

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:36.237
There's no way to be sure.

01:49:39.574 --> 01:49:42.827
A person could actually reexperience
the full effect of a tragedy...

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:45.580
long after the event took place.

01:49:45.663 --> 01:49:48.666

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.459
Are you relatives?

01:49:51.752 --> 01:49:54.755
Well, it doesn't matter.
We'll take care of him.

01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:58.009
He'll have to be sent back
to the same institution.

01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:02.096
What if I <i>was</i> a relative?

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:05.433
Well, you'd have the option
to care for him at home.

01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:07.935
But my advice is,
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:50:08.019 --> 01:50:11.105
It wouldn't be good for him.
He needs hospital care.

01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:15.443
I just thought you could sign
the release forms, but the city can do that.

01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:18.696

a funny, upbeat way...

of homelessness to television.

They're wacky and they're wise.

they love being homeless.

They love the freedom,
they love the adventure.

01:53:02.735 --> 01:53:05.529

the bullshit that we have to deal with...
