Yo, what up?

01:02.229 --> 01:03.262
Man!

01:04.297 --> 01:06.065
Man, you know who this is.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.534
No, it's Ashley.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.204
Yeah, yeah, got back

01:12.672 --> 01:13.839
I'm having a bunch of people

01:13.841 --> 01:14.973

01:14.975 --> 01:15.974
You gotta come.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.943
That's so nice.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.278
Huh?

01:22.315 --> 01:24.616
Man, you're the first
flyswatter I called.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.187
Come on, man,
we gotta get it started.

01:29.905 --> 01:31.224
Don't apologize to me.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.393
You're the one who's gonna
be missing all the ruckus.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.895
Yeah, yeah.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.197
All right, gimme a call.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.498
Later.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.568
Hey, trev, what's happening?

01:43.536 --> 01:44.703
It's Ashley.

01:45.472 --> 01:46.605
Douglas.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.274
You wanna come over
to my mom's house?

01:51.377 --> 01:52.711
Well, it's kinda like a party.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.313
Just a couple of people,
not too much.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.615
Yes, you wanna come over?

01:58.284 --> 02:00.119
No, don't even sweat it.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.121
What are these?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.355
Presents.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.357
Why are you giving me presents?

02:05.359 --> 02:06.792
We're not having
a birthday party.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.127
Oh, shut up.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.398
What is this for?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.900
So you'll look nice in them.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.604
Mom, where are my old clothes?
Where are they?

02:18.606 --> 02:21.473
Oh, they were all gross
and in my way.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.175
Mom, you threw away my clothes?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.988
Yo, Tommy! It's Ashley.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.657
I'm having some people over
tonight, if you wanna come over.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.760
No, I don't care.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.862
If you've got better things
to do, that's cool.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.532
Come on, man,
i just got back today.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.367
It's like a party, a good time.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.437
Come on.
Now, you owe me.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.940
And you can never come over to
my mom's house again, all right?

02:55.441 --> 02:55.440
You got it?

02:55.442 --> 02:58.410
You are officially banned
from the premises.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.854
Mom.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.988
This ain't a birthday party.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.123
I know that.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.824
Then why are you putting
candles on the cake?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.226
Candles are for celebrations.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.698
I'm not going to blow them out.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.738
- Hello, Ms. dottie.
- Ashley?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.707
When did you crawl out
of your hole?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.509
Why don't you try
being more positive?

04:37.877 --> 04:38.877
Hold up!

04:38.879 --> 04:40.545
You going to come up in my house

04:40.547 --> 04:43.015
and tell me I'm the one
who needs some positivity?

04:43.017 --> 04:44.850
You need a brain operation.

04:53.826 --> 04:54.760
Your booboo's back.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.328
No. Mm-mm.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.462
What d'you think,

04:57.464 --> 04:59.231
you can come back here
and have me again?

04:59.233 --> 05:01.466
You don't get the hint
when I don't pick up the phone?

05:01.468 --> 05:02.901
I have caller ID, you know?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.369
Look, I just wanted
to let you know

05:04.371 --> 05:06.338
that your baby boy
is back from his vacation.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.940
What you really want, trump?

05:08.942 --> 05:10.575
Hey, don't call me that.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.477
Hey, can dottie go back
on the side?

05:14.113 --> 05:15.747
- Um.
- Gotcha.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.521
Linda, I thought
about you everyday.

05:22.722 --> 05:22.721
So?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.824
I dreamt of your face
every time I closed my eyes.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.293
I was hoping
you thought of me, too.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.896
I'm back now, so we can finally
have some secret intimacy.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.899
I'm not interested in any type
of intimacies with you.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.204
I can't understand why
you feel this way, Linda.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.039
What did you expect,
i was gonna be like,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.975
"ooh, ash, now I ain't seen
or heard from you in forever.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.610
"I want you back"?

05:45.612 --> 05:48.013
I was just hoping you'd be
happy to see me, that's all.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.448
Happy to see you?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.851
You know, all this time
you've been gone,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.587
all this time, and I didn't
hear a word from you.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.024
You didn't write me
a letter or nothing.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.492
You don't know what
it's like in there...

06:00.494 --> 06:02.127
Let me tell you what it's like.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.596
When you're in love with someone

06:04.598 --> 06:06.264
and you're away from them,

06:06.266 --> 06:07.432
you write them a letter

06:07.434 --> 06:09.334
to tell them how much
you care about them.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.503
You sit down with a pencil
and some paper

06:11.505 --> 06:14.606
and you put into words
what you feel.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.508
You're supposed to learn this
like, in the third grade,

06:16.510 --> 06:17.609
but apparently, you didn't,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.444
because you were gone
for forever

06:19.446 --> 06:20.979
and I didn't hear a peep.

06:22.815 --> 06:23.982
I've moved on.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.917
I've got a man.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.085
Yes, she does.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.588
And I don't have time
to be moving backwards in life

06:29.590 --> 06:32.958
with somebody who is dumb
and always broke.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.727
Who's your new man, anyway?

06:36.095 --> 06:37.863
Dwayne.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.564
Dump truck Dwayne,
the garbage man?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.134
He may be a garbage man,
but he is good to me.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.735
You'd choose
the garbage man over me?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.737
What did I ever do to deserve
this type of treatment?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.739
What did you do?

06:48.007 --> 06:49.241
Do you want a list?

06:49.243 --> 06:50.942
Okay, how about the time
you tricked me

06:50.944 --> 06:52.744
into paying for your
other girlfriend's abortion?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.346
Are you going to bring that up?

06:54.348 --> 06:57.249
You're talking about the past,
I'm talking about the future.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.117
I'm talking about you and me.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.486
I'm talking about telling
the universe what you want

07:01.488 --> 07:02.654
and getting it.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.790
I'm talking about
the power of positivity.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.560
You are so boring.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.865
You can leave now.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.835
Okay, bye-bye.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.271
Okay, you can be like this now?

07:19.273 --> 07:22.340
But when dump truck Dwayne up and
leaves you for someone prettier,

07:22.342 --> 07:23.742
you're gonna be looking for me.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.277
You're gonna hunt me down.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.946
Okay, Ashley, you go ahead
and think positive.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.069
Don't you be digging up my yard!

08:25.371 --> 08:27.038
Mom, you haven't
seen it, have you?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.173
My toolbox.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.942
I ain't seen nothing,
but you digging up my grass.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.943
Why don't you
make yourself useful

08:32.946 --> 08:34.312
and do something I need?

08:34.313 --> 08:36.515
Like get rid of that old fridge?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.616
Mom, I can't move no fridge.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.558
Hey! Do you all need
a ladder up in there?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.626
It's a good deal.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.127
Nah, we're good.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.899
Hey!

08:52.900 --> 08:56.001
Hey, you guys!
Want a good deal on a ladder?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.637
We don't buy no
stolen goods, man!

08:58.639 --> 09:01.006
For you information,
my mother gave me this ladder.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.274
Thank you.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.310
Nice tall woman.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.246
Can I interest you in a ladder?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.348
Are you in need of a ladder?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.090
I'll help you.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.595
Lower it down.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.500
What is this,
a machine or something?

09:28.502 --> 09:30.068
Something like that.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.169
A respirator.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.538
What does it do?

09:33.540 --> 09:36.274
Nothing right now,
i got to get it fixed.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.709
Thanks for your help, though.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.010
Yeah, no problem.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.079
What's your name?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.280
Germs.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.749
Germs?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.351
Man, I'm not calling you, germs.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.919
- What's your real name.
- Jeremy.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.921
Nice!

09:49.488 --> 09:50.655
Hey, you need a ladder?

09:50.657 --> 09:51.923
No, I'm good.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.925
Right on, though.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.893
Yeah.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.895
No problem.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.351
Hey Jeremy, I need a favor.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.486
What are you doing?

10:21.488 --> 10:22.554
This your pickup?

10:22.556 --> 10:23.822
It's my granddad's.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.457
'Cause I was thinking,
since I helped you,

10:25.459 --> 10:26.791
maybe you should give me a hand.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.760
I would. Got somewhere
to be right now, though.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.929
Come on, I just need
the truck for like, an hour.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.231
Come on, man, get out of
my truck, I got swim lessons.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.234
I'll put my feet in the pool.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.506
Let's see who's the first
one to touch the wall.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.209
Who's the first one
to touch the wall?

10:45.678 --> 10:48.146
Usa wins! Usa!

11:20.681 --> 11:22.447
What is this?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.581
This is ulcer water?

11:23.583 --> 11:25.016
Yeah, give me that cup.

11:25.018 --> 11:25.950
You drink this?

11:25.952 --> 11:27.452
Don't worry about what I drink.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.221
Oh, man.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.956
That didn't go down right.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.892
I didn't tell you to drink it.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.568
Yeah, go on. Get that
hunk of junk outta here.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.869
Mom...

11:44.871 --> 11:46.871
Meet my new friend.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.540
Hi, Ms. Douglas,
I'm Jeremy.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.908
If you knew
what was good for you,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.943
you'd stay away from my son.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.112
Yeah, you'd probably
stay away from her, too.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.947
Well, maybe your new friend
can help you

11:55.949 --> 11:57.882
put them holes back
where they go.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.520
Buried something back here
long time ago,

12:02.522 --> 12:04.022
but can't find it now.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.291
My granddad has a metal detector,
if you want to borrow it.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.559
Yeah?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.697
- We're taking it now!
- -Good!

12:12.699 --> 12:13.998
You're welcome!

12:29.815 --> 12:31.449
You're dumping some stuff today?

12:31.451 --> 12:32.951
Thought you might be here.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.919
Hi, Ashley.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.988
Still being
a garbage man, I see.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.190
Yeah, well, just...

12:39.192 --> 12:40.959
Just trying to
make a living, man.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.062
Y'all try to drop
this stuff off?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.430
Just this fridge in the back.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.365
And the ladder?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.466
Ladder's for sale.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.702
You've dumped here before?

12:50.704 --> 12:52.804
No, I don't frequent
garbage places.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.075
Fill up this form, please.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.880
Heard you've been
running around with Linda.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.482
That's between me and her.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.717
All right, I notice

13:05.719 --> 13:07.585
you put on some weight
since I last saw you.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.120
How do you wanna pay the fee?

13:09.488 --> 13:10.488
Fee? What fee?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.824
There's a $100 Hazmat fee

13:12.826 --> 13:14.459
for the disposal
of refrigerators.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.195
So we got to pay you
$100 to throw something out?

13:20.499 --> 13:24.068
"Freon used as a refrigerant
is a hazardous material"

13:24.070 --> 13:26.638
"and there is special handling
involved in its disposal."

13:26.640 --> 13:29.140
"The county has assessed
a $100 fee"

13:29.142 --> 13:31.209
"to account for
this special handling."

13:33.913 --> 13:35.880
Now, I don't have a $100 on me.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.216
You want to give me
your fridge or not?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.652
I got the money,
you got to pay me back, though.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.053
Yeah? No problem.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.454
We'll get my mom
to pay you back.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.223
We got your money.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.563
All right.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.432
You're good
to drop off the fridge.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.968
You know, let me know
when you get tired of Linda.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.203
I'll take over.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.373
Ashley's back, baby.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.944
Man, how can she be
in love with that dude?

14:05.946 --> 14:06.978
Who would you rather have,

14:06.980 --> 14:08.746
me or that dude with the papers?

14:08.748 --> 14:10.148
I'm not getting into that.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.185
Where do you get
your money from?

14:14.486 --> 14:15.787
Work.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.789
- You don't work.
- I work.

14:17.791 --> 14:20.091
I do work for a medical
science company.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.728
Like what?
Test tube babies?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.129
No, really. I mean,
i don't know.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.798
Just test out new products.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.066
What kind of products?

14:29.034 --> 14:31.536
It varies. Everything from...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.938
Putting a tampon on my back,

14:33.940 --> 14:36.808
or try some new toilet paper.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.177
One time, they cut off
my pinky toe,

14:39.179 --> 14:41.279
and reattached it with a laser.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.249
Are you serious?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.886
Right now, I'm testing out
these new patches.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.723
I would never do this.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.458
Be some sort of lab rat.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.660
It helps them make medicine.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.262
How do you make your money?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.630
Rusty old ladders?

15:02.968 --> 15:05.336
You're not a very good swimmer,
are you?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.906
Not right now,
but I'll get there.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.508
You can hold your breath
for a long time?

15:09.842 --> 15:11.676
Not really.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.944
Got this weird disease

15:12.946 --> 15:15.380
where my lungs won't take
the oxygen I breath.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.582
Runs in the family,
my granddad got it, too.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.518
He's an inventor.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.486
People think he crazy,

15:21.488 --> 15:23.221
but he's the smartest man
in the world.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.358
I know this guy who could
hold his breath for forever.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.193
He can control his heart rate,

15:29.195 --> 15:30.595
body temperature,
he can control everything.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.530
- Yeah right.
- Yeah, he showed me.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.500
Had me grab his hands
and he held his breath.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.936
And I could feel his hands
getting colder, like ice cold.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.438
I've been working on it myself.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.440
I could hold my breath
longer than you.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.474
I believe that.

15:45.477 --> 15:47.178
On a count of three.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.048
- One, two, three...
- Let me stop chewing.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.988
Hold it, there goes my aunt.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.222
Yeah, who's that?
I see her butt from here.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.991
How you gonna talk
about my aunt like that?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.926
- She got a man?
- No...

16:34.928 --> 16:37.161
She used to have this
cold cut take care of her.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.663
Does she work at a donut?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.664
For the time being.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.099
She wanna be
a stay-at-home mom.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.633
What happened to her man?

16:42.635 --> 16:43.935
Got into a bad car accident.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.137
He got paralyzed
from the waist up.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.505
You can't paralyze
from the waist up.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.439
I'm telling you he was!

16:48.441 --> 16:50.174
How, how are you
going to be like that?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.042
Look.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.677
See, his legs still work.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.412
But he was bent over like this.

16:55.714 --> 16:56.948
Wait, wait...

16:56.950 --> 16:59.317
You think she would get me
if I walked around like that?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.618
Hey, honey, let me take you out.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.587
I don't think about that, man.
That's my aunt.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.755
Now, you know what I mean?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.156
She looking for a man?

17:25.944 --> 17:27.310
Why don't you
take your shirt off?

17:27.613 --> 17:28.813
Mmm.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.248
No, I'm good.

17:32.751 --> 17:33.818
I wanna look at you.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.921
- No. No!
- I wanna look at you.

17:36.923 --> 17:37.989
No!

17:37.991 --> 17:39.490
- I wanna look at you.
- Oh...

17:39.492 --> 17:41.359
They look weird
when I'm laying down.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.627
They're looking good to me.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.029
Stop!

17:45.031 --> 17:47.131
Get, get from under there!

18:11.023 --> 18:12.790
I got something
i got to tell you about.

18:13.692 --> 18:14.692
Okay...

18:15.027 --> 18:16.194
What?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.364
I'm in love with somebody else.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.134
I've been in love with this girl
since the first day I saw her.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.440
Is that all right with you?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.478
She your girlfriend
or something?

18:35.013 --> 18:36.214
Mmm...

18:37.616 --> 18:39.817
So right now, she's got
a different situation.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.789
So why are you
telling me about her?

18:47.759 --> 18:49.327
I don't know, I like you.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.296
You're looking good,

18:53.031 --> 18:54.398
you got a fine butt.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.238
But I'm always gonna
love me some Linda.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.509
She got a hold on me.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.348
But she just won't
love me anymore.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.592
So you wanna be my girl?

19:50.155 --> 19:51.656
Hey! How are you doin',
Ms. Douglas?

19:51.658 --> 19:52.690
Hi.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.824
All right.

19:53.826 --> 19:53.824
Is Ashley home?

19:53.826 --> 19:57.128
Him and that woman back there
bumping for an hour.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.429
He thinks I can't hear them.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.497
Can you tell him I'm here?

19:59.499 --> 20:02.099
Ashley, your little
buddy's here.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.402
With some kind
of vacuum cleaner or something.

20:04.404 --> 20:04.402
Thanks.

20:04.404 --> 20:09.240
Ms. Douglas, do you have the $100
from the fridge we got rid of?

20:09.242 --> 20:11.309
Why they are charge you
to throw things away

20:11.311 --> 20:12.743
makes no sense to me.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.386
Jeremy!

20:22.388 --> 20:23.854
What is this contraption?

20:23.856 --> 20:26.157
This is my granddad's metal
detector i was telling you about.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.425
Oh, yeah?

20:28.126 --> 20:29.360
Oh, this is...
This is light.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.995
- Not even heavy at all.
- No, it's not.

20:31.597 --> 20:32.863
How does it work?

20:32.865 --> 20:35.433
If you twist this down to
whatever you're trying to find.

20:35.435 --> 20:39.637
Gold, silver, copper, aluminum,

20:39.639 --> 20:41.105
depending on what
you are trying to find.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.406
Where do you plug it in?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.841
I don't plug it in,

20:43.843 --> 20:46.143
I got a little battery pack
on the side with some magnets,

20:46.145 --> 20:48.346
on this little belt,
to put around the waist.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.081
And it'll work over
any like, terrain...

20:50.083 --> 20:51.482
- Grass...
- Yeah, yeah.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.651
Mom, what are you doing?
We're having a conversation.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.387
What are you giving the money
to Jeremy for?

20:56.389 --> 20:58.489
That's between Jeremy and me.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.531
I'm not getting nothing.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.333
You're going over
the places I dug.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.036
Let me try it.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.170
- Can I try?
- Sure.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.772
- Hold it there.
- Uh-huh.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.474
Take this.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.808
Put this over your neck.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.279
Okay, take the earphones.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.814
Okay.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.583
Take this.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.020
- Put this on your arm.
- How do I know it's working?

21:29.022 --> 21:30.755
It beeps whenever
there is metal.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.757
- It beeps?
- Yeah.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.759
Wait a minute.

21:34.593 --> 21:35.660
There you go.

21:36.862 --> 21:37.762
You know what?

21:37.764 --> 21:40.031
Let's just see
if this thing even works.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.132
Yeah.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.233
Yeah, it works.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.001
What was that?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.303
Let's just say some people think

21:45.305 --> 21:47.438
it's cool to kick somebody
when they're down.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.581
Hey, I hear something, man.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.450
Yo, I hear something,
i hear it, man!

21:59.452 --> 22:01.686
- Is it like a beep, beep...
- Listen, listen, listen.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.855
- It's a beep.
- Listen, man, it's a beep.

22:04.857 --> 22:05.890
I got it.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.358
That's the beep right here.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.559
Don't lose that spot
right there.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.760
Keep your eye on that spot.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.065
Now, back up, back up,
back up, all right?

22:14.766 --> 22:14.765
Look.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.934
I just want to say this upfront,

22:16.936 --> 22:19.737
if the box is here,
this box is for my eyes only.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.505
- You can't see my emergency objects.
- Okay.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.940
- Promise?
- Promise.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.931
Yeah!

22:58.310 --> 23:00.077
Ah, ha-ha!

23:00.079 --> 23:01.545
Ha-ha!

23:14.192 --> 23:15.493
What d'you got?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.161
Are those some panties?

23:17.163 --> 23:18.262
No, no, don't look at those.

23:18.264 --> 23:19.630
Give them back, give them back!

23:19.632 --> 23:21.432
- Yeah... -I told you
not to look at those.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.434
- They are some panties.
- Come on!

23:24.403 --> 23:25.636
What are you all doing?

23:25.638 --> 23:28.072
Ashely buried some panties
in the yard.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.775
You all acting like a bunch of kids who
ain't never seen no panties before.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.276
I seen you pan...

23:32.278 --> 23:34.111
I seen your panties
five minutes ago.

23:49.895 --> 23:50.895
Linda!

23:52.497 --> 23:53.898
Look, I know you in there.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.200
I saw the garbage man
and I know I'm better than him.

23:59.404 --> 24:02.239
I'm gonna remind you
of what you feel for me.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.574
Man, shut up!

24:10.382 --> 24:11.582
"Dearest Ashley,"

24:12.350 --> 24:14.118
"you are the perfect man for me."

24:15.153 --> 24:16.921
"I cannot imagine
life without you,"

24:16.923 --> 24:18.923
"and I can picture
our future together."

24:19.891 --> 24:21.892
"We are happy in love."

24:21.894 --> 24:24.728
"Our wedding is all white, and pink,
and in a big beautiful church,"

24:24.730 --> 24:26.730
"with all our families there."

24:26.732 --> 24:29.166
"We have three babies,
and a house."

24:29.168 --> 24:30.601
"And we are a family."

24:31.403 --> 24:34.038
"I will love you
for all of time."

24:34.673 --> 24:36.707
"Forever yours, Linda."

24:36.709 --> 24:40.544
Who are you talking to?

24:41.246 --> 24:42.746
She's not home!

24:44.417 --> 24:46.484
Well, you just tell her
what she told me.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.918
She said, "forever."

24:48.253 --> 24:49.253
Forever.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.981
What's going on out here?

25:51.616 --> 25:53.584
Don't worry about it, mom.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.185
What are you doing
with all of these?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.122
Making my money.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.925
You're making a mess
is what you're doing.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.793
Mom, you're worried about
a fridge on your porch?

26:02.795 --> 26:05.162
But you had that one old
fridge back here for forever,

26:05.164 --> 26:06.597
and I took it away, right?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.566
Now you got these,
but you won't even notice.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.401
They'll be gone
real soon, I promise.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.835
All right?

26:11.837 --> 26:13.270
Trust me.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.134
Hello.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.971
You look like you know
something about book bags.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.607
Yeah, sure. Uh...

26:49.609 --> 26:51.675
What are you thinking?
What are you looking for?

26:51.677 --> 26:52.843
I need, uh...

26:52.845 --> 26:56.447
The best book bag
for about under $30.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.048
We should be able
to find something.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.050
Um...

26:59.985 --> 27:02.686
I saw someone buy this
the other day.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.954
They looked pretty pleased.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.724
It's a pretty solid bag.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.592
Which one has
the most compartments?

27:08.594 --> 27:10.527
Compartments, as in how?

27:10.529 --> 27:12.229
I'm gonna have a lot
of supplies, and pencils,

27:12.231 --> 27:13.430
so I need some compartments.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.699
Okay, so you need room.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.735
Well, this...
This larger bag,

27:18.470 --> 27:20.104
it's a pretty dynamic bag.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.073
It's got the adjustable
safety wires,

27:24.275 --> 27:25.342
shoulder straps...

27:25.344 --> 27:27.144
That's a coin purse.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.115
It's got a good base,
can fit books, notebooks,

27:31.117 --> 27:32.316
laptop computer.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.552
You're welcome to try it on,
if you want.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.521
People buy this bag,
like teachers?

27:37.523 --> 27:39.123
Oh, of course, all the time.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.424
Teachers, students,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.092
professors, athletes.

27:42.627 --> 27:43.761
Try it on.

27:47.632 --> 27:48.766
How does that feel?

27:49.467 --> 27:51.101
- Yeah, feels nice.
- Feels nice?

27:51.603 --> 27:53.137
Yeah.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.239
- All right. Good luck.
- Thank you.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.243
Stop!

28:33.245 --> 28:34.311
Ashley!

28:34.313 --> 28:36.380
Why you gotta do that?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.848
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

28:38.416 --> 28:39.483
Hey.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.584
Yeah.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.252
I thought you'd be done
a while ago.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.287
Uh-uh. And you know

28:43.289 --> 28:45.289
you don't have to
wait around for me, right?

28:45.291 --> 28:46.323
Yes, I do.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.726
Somebody's gotta, you know,
watch your back.

28:48.728 --> 28:49.860
Oh, from that dude?

28:49.862 --> 28:52.362
Uh-uh. Come on. Let's go.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.764
- You know what I think?
- Hmm?

28:53.766 --> 28:55.933
I think taco man
really likes you.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.501
What makes you say that?

28:57.503 --> 28:59.169
You've been
wearing him out lately.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.605
Yeah, well,
he manages the hotel.

29:01.607 --> 29:02.973
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.812
Think he got some refrigerators
he might want to get rid of?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.681
I don't know.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.983
He does have one of them
small ones, you know.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.219
Small ones got the freon
in them too, don't they?

29:16.187 --> 29:17.521
Ask him for me.

29:17.523 --> 29:18.956
Well, what you got going on?

29:18.958 --> 29:20.390
Oh, I'm headed to this class.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.159
- Oh, okay. -You wanna
take this to the house?

29:22.161 --> 29:23.227
Yeah. Sure.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.361
See you later on tonight.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.196
- I don't know.
- -I don't know!

29:26.198 --> 29:29.032
I might have something going
on, I'll let you know later.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.534
All right, come on,
people know me here.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.869
All right, I'm late.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.570
I'll see you later tonight
or else.

29:33.572 --> 29:34.638
Or else what?

29:34.640 --> 29:35.806
I'll think of something.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.307
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.042
Bye!

30:12.110 --> 30:13.110
Pittman?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.078
Jeremy pittman?

30:18.183 --> 30:19.650
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

30:19.652 --> 30:20.951
I'm okay.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.220
Good, do you need anything?
Some water, or snacks?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.388
Sure!

30:24.390 --> 30:25.656
What would you like?

30:25.658 --> 30:26.790
I don't know, like...

30:26.792 --> 30:27.891
Steak and fries?

30:27.893 --> 30:30.127
Oh, yeah.
Coming right up.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.663
Hey, Tammy, we would like
a fillet mignon,

30:32.665 --> 30:34.097
and a side order of fries.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.201
So...

30:38.036 --> 30:40.070
Now tell me, are you having

30:40.072 --> 30:42.439
any adverse side effects
to your patches?

30:42.441 --> 30:43.774
No, ma'am, nothing adverse.

30:43.776 --> 30:45.309
I do have a question, though.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.276
Go ahead.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.412
My friend Ashley said
he know a guy

30:48.414 --> 30:50.714
that can control his body
temperature by holding his breath.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.949
Is that possible?

30:51.951 --> 30:54.551
Well, I haven't researched
that, Mr. pittman,

30:54.553 --> 30:56.286
but I'll look into that, okay?

30:57.455 --> 30:59.022
Let's see... breath...

30:59.524 --> 31:00.958
I'll let you know.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.993
Um, now, what I want to do,

31:02.995 --> 31:05.128
if it's okay with you, is this.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.899
Double your dosage of
the patch you've been wearing.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.400
You just doubled them
the last time.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.737
Yes, but I'd like to up
the dosage to four patches.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.073
Will I be the only person
wearing four patches?

31:17.675 --> 31:19.409
Well, Jeremy,

31:19.411 --> 31:21.745
we find you a particularly

31:21.747 --> 31:23.881
meaningful subject
for our purposes.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.215
What do you mean?

31:25.217 --> 31:28.619
It's rare for a male
of your age, race

31:28.621 --> 31:29.987
and economic status

31:29.989 --> 31:32.422
to volunteer for tests
at our offices.

31:32.657 --> 31:33.957
It is.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.126
Dr. merton, you care
about me, right?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.595
Let me be honest.

31:40.365 --> 31:41.565
Some of the results

31:41.567 --> 31:43.567
we are getting
from your tests...

31:43.569 --> 31:46.803
Well, they're different than
what we expect, in a good way.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.405
What's in it for me?

31:48.407 --> 31:49.439
Well, naturally, we would

31:49.441 --> 31:51.842
double the amount
of money you receive.

31:51.844 --> 31:53.810
Can I still go swimming
with the patches on?

31:53.812 --> 31:55.979
Yes, you can go swimming
with the patches on.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.515
Just keep living your life
the way you normally would.

31:58.517 --> 31:58.515
All right.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.351
If I start feeling worried,
i'mma rip them right off.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.554
That would be
completely understandable.

32:08.860 --> 32:09.960
<i>It's been a long time</i>

32:09.962 --> 32:11.522
<i>since I've been
in one of these rooms.</i>

32:12.363 --> 32:14.431
I'm sorry the desks
are so small.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.999
Aw, these desks are cool.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.870
Let me see
if I can still fit in them.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.472
Yeah. Here you go.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.443
Mr. Carlos, how long
do you think this will take?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.245
Jeremy said you were
really good at this.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.047
Well, that depends.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.982
On how much you put into it,

32:31.984 --> 32:33.483
and where you are
at your skill level.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.645
You know the alphabet, right?

32:35.353 --> 32:36.353
Really?

32:37.121 --> 32:38.989
Yeah. Do you know it?

32:39.139 --> 32:40.458
All right, Mr. Carlos,

32:40.459 --> 32:43.360
I want to say this upfront,
i am not stupid.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.362
I don't expect to be treated
like I am stupid.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.496
I can read, I can write,

32:46.498 --> 32:48.899
I can do all the things
i need to do to survive.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.267
Let me just hear you say them.

32:51.703 --> 32:52.869
It'll be a good warm up.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.371
Get your brain
in the mood to learn.

32:54.373 --> 32:58.308
T-f-z-a-o-c-m-x
b-l-j-e-n-g-u-i-p

32:58.310 --> 33:01.511
h-y-w-k-2-d-v-o-s.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.180
Is that the only order
you know it in?

33:03.182 --> 33:05.662
I mean, it doesn't matter any
order, 'cause i know the letters.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.218
Let me hear it again.

33:10.722 --> 33:15.125
R-d-a-i-w-b-z-g-c-v-o-x

33:15.127 --> 33:19.229
j-u-h-m-e-k-y-n-f-t-p-s.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.065
Okay, can you write your name?

33:22.067 --> 33:23.233
Yeah, not in cursive.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.601
No, no, no.
Regular is fine.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.036
Yeah, I can do that, I mean,

33:26.038 --> 33:28.372
- can I use the chalk and board...
- Sure.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.319
Does that look right? 'Cause
it looks kinda weird to me.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.987
No, it looks right to me.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.255
Now, can you sign
your signature,

33:45.257 --> 33:47.391
like you would on some sort
of document or form?

33:57.402 --> 33:59.036
All right.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.071
Now, I need you to fill out
this questionnaire.

34:03.441 --> 34:04.541
You mean, like a test?

34:04.942 --> 34:06.977
Kinda.

34:06.979 --> 34:09.012
It'll give me a better idea
of where you are.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.583
You see, I'm...

34:13.585 --> 34:15.252
I'm not that good
at this kind of thing.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.820
I know, it's just
between you and me.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.661
Mr. Carlos, do all the letters
get turned into cursives?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.130
Yes, all of them.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.366
It's a dumb question, huh?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.301
There are no dumb questions,
Mr. Douglas.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.735
Okay. Well, I got
another one.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.539
Do the numbers get turned into
cursives, or just the letters?

34:36.873 --> 34:38.442
That's a good question.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.444
All right.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.109
You're home!

36:19.111 --> 36:20.944
The king has returned
from his voyage.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.179
Oh, yeah?

36:22.181 --> 36:25.348
And where did your voyage
take you today, my lord?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.883
- Oh-ho...
- Oh...

36:28.553 --> 36:29.619
We sailed long.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.488
To faraway lands.

36:32.857 --> 36:33.890
Slayed dragons.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.094
Then found buried treasures,

36:38.096 --> 36:39.996
and now I've returned home,

36:39.998 --> 36:43.700
to bend my fair maiden over,
to take advantage of my queen.

36:47.905 --> 36:51.675
I'm telling you,
you can't do it.

36:51.677 --> 36:54.077
You old man, you weigh
like what, 85 pounds?

36:54.079 --> 36:55.712
How about $5? Try!

36:55.714 --> 36:57.614
You ain't even got $5.

36:57.616 --> 36:57.614
Of course, I got $5.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.218
I made $75 this morning before you
were even out of bed probably.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.686
Now come on.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.288
Don't stop backpedaling now.
I'm making it easy for you.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.723
All right?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.258
Just all relaxed and cool.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.593
Oh, there you go.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.861
Look at the vain popping
at your vein forehead, go ahead.

37:11.863 --> 37:12.863
Come on, bud.

37:13.406 --> 37:14.665
Were you trying this?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.700
This is what you were
trying to do?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.401
Look how easy it is,
you know what I mean?

37:19.003 --> 37:20.270
You owe me $5.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.639
I ain't giving you $5.
That wasn't the deal.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.908
What are you talking about, you never
bet somebody something before?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.243
There was no deal.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.410
Are you one of those little
pinky-thumb type dudes?

37:27.412 --> 37:29.646
You are a vulture, my friend.

37:29.648 --> 37:30.680
You owe me $5.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.916
You just said you'd
give me $5 if I did it.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.217
Okay.

37:34.219 --> 37:35.285
You gotta let me use the truck.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.786
You can't drive!

37:36.788 --> 37:38.154
No, you gotta drive. I got some
fridges i got to get rid of.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.856
Some more fridges?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.958
Yeah, I'm making money. I'm charging
people $75 to throw them out.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.994
Damn, you got to pay
to throw them out yourself.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.263
Not in bedford county, they
don't have that throwaway fee.

37:46.265 --> 37:50.200
So you want me to drive to bedford
county to throw away some more fridges.

37:50.202 --> 37:52.202
I'll pay your gas money,
it's only an hour away.

37:52.204 --> 37:53.303
Now how many can we fit?

37:53.305 --> 37:54.604
I don't know, how many you got?

37:54.606 --> 37:56.206
I've got three, but I want more!

37:56.208 --> 37:57.674
There's a house
across the street from me

37:57.676 --> 37:59.142
that's got some fridges
in the yard.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.077
What kind of fridges?

38:01.079 --> 38:02.746
Regular.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.214
Well, why didn't you said?
Let's go.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.483
Let me just show you how
an old man does business.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.485
Come on.

38:07.952 --> 38:08.985
All right?

38:11.990 --> 38:14.624
We got to get you some
spinach, too, you're weak.

38:23.267 --> 38:24.434
This is the house?

38:24.436 --> 38:25.769
This is the house.

38:25.771 --> 38:26.870
This is Santa's house.

38:26.872 --> 38:27.937
Who's Santa?

38:27.939 --> 38:29.873
Oh, you'll see. Old friend.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.021
Excuse me, can I help you?

38:45.023 --> 38:46.356
I'm here to see Santa.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.490
Do you have a session scheduled?

38:47.492 --> 38:49.192
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just let her know...

38:49.194 --> 38:51.561
I'm in the middle of an appointment,
you need to come back later.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.364
I'm sorry,
you must be Ashley Douglas.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.599
- I've heard a lot about you...
- No!

38:56.601 --> 38:58.335
- I'm not.
- That's right. You ain't.

38:58.636 --> 38:58.635
I am.

38:58.637 --> 39:02.739
Now go inside and tell Santa,
Ashley Douglas is out here waiting.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.442
Be a good boy.

39:06.877 --> 39:07.944
Thank you.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.394
All right.

39:24.396 --> 39:25.628
What's that?

39:26.397 --> 39:27.330
Come on in.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.732
Thanks, buddy.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.635
Oh, the gang is all here, huh?

39:32.637 --> 39:35.004
What are we,
on vacation or work?

39:35.006 --> 39:36.873
Great shirts. Ashley Douglas.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.242
Yeah, you better watch
your fingers, I get it.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.777
Don't want to lose a digit.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.980
What's that?
This is tight ship.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.950
- This way, please.
- That's a good picture.

39:48.018 --> 39:49.786
- Wow!

39:49.788 --> 39:50.687
The magic moment.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.322
How're you doing?
Congratulations.

39:52.324 --> 39:53.323
You're a very lucky man.

39:53.325 --> 39:54.824
I'm telling you,
you're a very lucky man.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.859
Beautiful, compliments.
Very happy...

39:55.861 --> 39:57.427
We are in the middle
of a session.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.295
I just want to wish them
a word of matrimony.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.064
It would be nice to have guests.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.634
Smile!

40:05.202 --> 40:07.470
- Not so big...
- Santa.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.439
Ashley Douglas.

40:10.207 --> 40:12.275
When did your corn dog get back?

40:12.277 --> 40:13.476
Uh, it's been a bit.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.012
Uh-huh, you just had to come
and see me, huh?

40:16.014 --> 40:17.881
You having wet dreams again
or something?

40:17.883 --> 40:20.049
Well, you know you always
give me wet dreams.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.853
Actually, I'm here
on a business proposition.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.156
You're looking handsome
these days.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.160
I could eat you...

40:30.162 --> 40:31.162
Got any hot sauce?

40:32.499 --> 40:33.998
Santa, what I'm here for,

40:33.999 --> 40:37.200
why you have those fridges
on your porch?

40:37.202 --> 40:38.902
'Cause I eat a lot
and they break.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.307
I'm kidding, we switched the
operations around to digital.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.576
You know the county charges
a $100 to throw away a fridge?

40:46.578 --> 40:48.044
That's why they're
sitting on my porch.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.413
Well, I got a business where
i only charge $75 per fridge

40:50.415 --> 40:51.748
and we dispose of them for you.

40:51.750 --> 40:52.782
Mm-hmm.

40:54.418 --> 40:55.718
Who's that skinny dude?

40:56.387 --> 40:57.787
It's... he's with me.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.290
He's my...
Girl's nephew.

41:00.292 --> 41:01.658
Hi, Santa. I'm Jeremy.

41:02.359 --> 41:03.760
You got a girlfriend?

41:03.994 --> 41:03.993
No.

41:03.995 --> 41:08.031
You wanna come and lay
on top of me for a minute?

41:08.033 --> 41:09.232
Just lay on top of you?

41:09.234 --> 41:10.800
Yeah.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.036
I'm like a human water bed.

41:17.274 --> 41:18.274
Right here.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.477
Oh...

41:20.978 --> 41:21.978
Oh...

41:29.287 --> 41:31.020
It's okay.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.823
- Same old Santa.
- -Oh!

41:33.825 --> 41:37.060
Greg, go ahead and get that
Turkey dinner $150 for me.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.062
Thank you.

41:40.931 --> 41:41.998
Come and get it.

41:43.334 --> 41:47.470
You know you always got a place
to come and lay your head.

41:47.472 --> 41:49.973
I'm yours always,
me and my wrinkled dog.

41:52.009 --> 41:54.244
We'll get those fridges
out of your hand.

41:54.945 --> 41:55.945
Greg.

41:57.781 --> 41:58.781
Bob!

42:32.583 --> 42:34.617
Ooh, that ain't gonna work.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.601
No, no, nah-uh.

42:51.603 --> 42:52.869
No more fridges.

42:52.871 --> 42:56.239
Mom, please don't be mad,
all right? This is good.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.907
I can't take this anymore.

42:58.442 --> 42:59.943
I mean, the holes,

42:59.945 --> 43:03.112
the weird smells from your room,
the refrigerators...

43:03.114 --> 43:03.112
I can't do this anymore.

43:03.114 --> 43:06.149
Why are you embarrassing me
in front of my friend?

43:06.151 --> 43:07.250
You should be happy for me.

43:07.252 --> 43:09.218
Each of these fridges, $75 cash.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.253
Tax-free.

43:10.255 --> 43:12.355
Why don't you go live
with your new friend?

43:12.357 --> 43:15.725
And you all can collect
all the refrigerators you want

43:15.727 --> 43:17.894
and put them all over
everywhere for all I care.

43:17.896 --> 43:20.463
First of all, Jeremy lives in the
nursing home with his grandpa.

43:20.465 --> 43:21.965
So I can't live there.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.367
Second of all, maybe you should
go live in a nursing home.

43:24.369 --> 43:27.070
I gotta go get the truck fixed,
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:28.539 --> 43:31.541
You and that woman
need to get out of my house.

43:31.543 --> 43:34.277
I have tried to care
for you, Ashley.

43:34.279 --> 43:35.545
To provide for you.

43:35.547 --> 43:38.147
But you just don't know
how to be acting.

43:39.383 --> 43:40.683
So you kicking us out.

43:40.685 --> 43:42.418
Putting us out on the street.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.886
You're supposed to be an adult,

43:43.888 --> 43:46.022
so you need to be
acting like one.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.057
Fine. When do we need
to be out by?

43:48.059 --> 43:50.760
As soon as a.S.A.P.

44:06.543 --> 44:08.745
Here's your respirator,
Mr. pittman.

44:09.880 --> 44:12.081
Got a little bad news for you.

44:12.083 --> 44:15.118
The parts needed to fix this
machine, they don't make it anymore.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.220
So consequently, we were
unable to fix it.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.122
The other guy said
it'd be ready by today.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.356
Yeah, I know.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.125
We tried to get it ready
by today,

44:22.127 --> 44:24.861
but we couldn't even find the manufacturer's
name anywhere on this machine,

44:24.863 --> 44:25.962
to even order the parts.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.563
That's because
my granddad invented it.

44:27.565 --> 44:29.399
And because
your grandfather invented it,

44:29.401 --> 44:32.235
he's the one who can fix it,
'cause this is his invention.

44:32.237 --> 44:35.038
You see, there's no point of
reference anywhere on this machine

44:35.040 --> 44:37.140
to even tell us exactly
what this thing does.

44:37.142 --> 44:39.242
The other guy said
you all could figure it out.

44:39.244 --> 44:40.543
Yeah, I know, we tried,

44:40.545 --> 44:43.379
but unfortunately, Mr. pittman,
we couldn't figure it out.

45:00.297 --> 45:02.098
Truck broke down
today, granddad.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.836
I didn't do anything wrong.
It just stopped working.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.473
I'll take it to a mechanic
tomorrow and get it fixed.

45:12.976 --> 45:15.878
Those repairman couldn't figure
out how to work your respirator.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.415
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

45:27.691 --> 45:28.925
We got to get out of here.

45:30.227 --> 45:31.227
Why?

45:32.029 --> 45:33.396
'Cause it's my mom's house

45:33.398 --> 45:35.358
and I'm old enough to be
having a place of my own.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.334
Your mom's kicking us out?

45:40.037 --> 45:41.404
Yeah.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.472
It's happened before.

45:42.474 --> 45:43.973
She gets on these tirades,
you know.

45:46.543 --> 45:48.344
Ray asked me
to move in with him.

45:50.147 --> 45:51.714
- Taco man?
- Hmm.

45:51.716 --> 45:54.150
- The one you said is ashy and gross?
- Mm-hmm.

45:59.022 --> 46:00.662
You think he might
let me stay there, too?

46:03.560 --> 46:05.194
Does this mean
you wanna be with me?

46:06.530 --> 46:07.930
What's that got to do
with anything?

46:11.468 --> 46:13.336
I mean...

46:13.338 --> 46:15.838
He's not gonna let us
stay there if we're together.

46:17.641 --> 46:19.442
He's gonna be trying
to be with me.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.145
He's gonna make me
his girlfriend.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.046
Hm, but you're my girl.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.784
I know, but he can't know that.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.021
So, I got to know
where we stand,

46:32.023 --> 46:34.190
if he's gonna be
coming to me like that.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.325
I don't know, nat.

46:42.499 --> 46:44.033
What about that other girl?

46:45.636 --> 46:47.937
The one you talk about
in your sleep.

46:50.774 --> 46:52.909
I explained to you
the Linda situation.

46:53.977 --> 46:57.046
Well, why do you waste
your time with that, Ashley?

46:57.048 --> 46:59.749
I mean, you and me have something
real, don't you see that?

46:59.751 --> 47:01.651
You cannot get in the way
of me and Linda.

47:06.089 --> 47:08.591
You know, I'm sorry I'm not as
good as her, Ashley, but...

47:08.921 --> 47:10.360
Sometimes when you can't

47:10.361 --> 47:14.130
get the person that
you really want to be with,

47:14.132 --> 47:16.999
you got to settle for somebody
you actually can get.

47:19.102 --> 47:22.538
Can't you just help me find a place to stay
without making me be in love with you?

47:26.543 --> 47:28.811
- Hey!
- -Whoo!

47:28.813 --> 47:29.853
- How are you?
- What's up?

47:31.115 --> 47:33.516
Uh, you remember
my friend, Ashley?

47:33.518 --> 47:35.718
That I was telling...
Yeah, helped my nephew.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.187
- Yeah, he here.
- What's he doing here?

47:38.189 --> 47:38.187
Uh-huh.

47:38.189 --> 47:41.390
Yeah, he just wanted
to talk to you, do it for me.

47:41.392 --> 47:42.392
All right, baby.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.928
You must be Ashley.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.763
You must be ray.

47:47.765 --> 47:49.765
She tell me what you did
for Jeremy.

47:49.767 --> 47:51.901
- Oh, yeah?
- I think that's great, man.

47:51.903 --> 47:53.102
After helping someone like that,

47:53.104 --> 47:55.037
you deserve a chance
at a normal life.

47:56.173 --> 47:56.906
Well, thank you.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.140
I don't want to impose...

47:58.142 --> 48:00.109
It would be
until everything shakes out.

48:00.111 --> 48:01.878
Gonna look for
another job again?

48:01.880 --> 48:03.279
Oh, yeah, soon.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.047
I'm taking some classes,
so that might get in the way,

48:05.049 --> 48:07.550
but I've been talking to some banks
about getting a small business loan.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.185
How nice. What for?

48:10.254 --> 48:11.787
Still working out
the personal details.

48:11.789 --> 48:13.189
Yeah, yeah, of course.

48:15.359 --> 48:17.226
And I can help out around the
place if you need anything.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.161
I'm good at fixing things
in a room.

48:19.163 --> 48:22.732
Like, the light bulbs,
toilets, beds, refrigerators.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.133
I might take you up on that.

48:24.468 --> 48:25.534
Okay.

48:26.803 --> 48:28.604
I'm a sucker for this woman.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.139
Yeah.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.941
Never met anyone like her.

48:34.678 --> 48:36.646
You good for her,
you good for me.

48:39.316 --> 48:40.650
I like your shirt.

48:40.652 --> 48:41.984
Match my car.

48:42.319 --> 48:43.319
Come on.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.361
Ashley!

49:25.363 --> 49:25.361
Huh?

49:25.363 --> 49:28.497
Come on, man, you're not
even paying attention.

49:29.232 --> 49:30.566
Yes, I am.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.969
Yeah? Then what did I just say?

49:32.971 --> 49:34.603
That I'm not paying
any attention.

49:34.605 --> 49:35.638
No, before that.

49:36.573 --> 49:38.140
Ashley, you need to pay
better attention.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.542
It's not like I can download

49:39.544 --> 49:41.644
this knowledge into your brain
like a computer.

49:41.646 --> 49:42.812
You got to do your part.

49:42.814 --> 49:44.046
I wish you could download it.

49:44.048 --> 49:45.481
It'd be a lot easier.

49:45.483 --> 49:46.682
Yeah, it would be easier,

49:46.684 --> 49:48.724
but then, you wouldn't
get the pleasure of learning.

49:49.553 --> 49:52.088
Okay, Mr. Carlos,
i was on the moon for a second,

49:52.090 --> 49:53.456
but I'll pay better attention.

49:54.691 --> 49:56.325
Could you do me a favor, and

49:56.327 --> 49:58.728
write something out in cursive
so I can see what it looks like?

49:58.730 --> 50:00.196
Sure, what is it?

50:00.998 --> 50:02.264
Secret intimacies.

50:03.867 --> 50:05.067
Okay.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.286
Well, well, well.

50:57.288 --> 50:59.422
Where you guys heading?
The armory or something?

50:59.424 --> 51:00.823
No, man.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.625
We're going to get our eat on.

51:02.627 --> 51:04.493
All right, I'm cool,
don't worry 'bout me.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.796
Ray's taking me out
for my birthday.

51:07.831 --> 51:09.532
- Today's your birthday?
- Mm-hmm.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.667
I wish I had known,
i would have got you something.

51:11.669 --> 51:12.868
It's okay.

51:12.870 --> 51:14.270
Oh, how was class?

51:14.272 --> 51:16.338
Class is going real well,
thank you.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.340
Teacher said I'm gonna be
a good small business owner.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.408
That's good, Ashley.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.177
Talk to your friends
at the bank yet?

51:21.179 --> 51:22.511
Working on it.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.047
We gotta jam.

51:25.049 --> 51:26.916
We got reservations to make.

51:26.918 --> 51:29.418
All right then, reservation man.
Good work.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.420
- Have a good one.
- -Bye, Ashley.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.389
All right, bye.
Happy birthday.

51:34.225 --> 51:35.658
Happy birthday, everybody!

51:52.809 --> 51:55.478
Look at you.
Got it?

51:55.480 --> 51:57.046
- They didn't see you, right?
- No.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.181
Straight back, straight back.

52:02.319 --> 52:03.719
All right, come this way.

52:03.721 --> 52:04.787
That's my boy.

52:06.022 --> 52:07.990
There you go.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.125
- You're good.

52:10.827 --> 52:12.428
- Whoa, nice one.
- Yeah.

52:12.430 --> 52:13.863
How much did you get for this?

52:13.865 --> 52:15.464
Only 50 this time.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.000
All right.

52:18.002 --> 52:19.602
Some money is better
than no money, right?

52:19.604 --> 52:20.604
Yep.

52:25.075 --> 52:26.642
Today is your aunt's birthday?

52:26.644 --> 52:28.244
Oh, yeah, it is today.

52:28.246 --> 52:29.712
You got to tell me
about these things.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.947
- I forgot.
- Did you get her a present?

52:31.949 --> 52:32.949
No, did you?

52:34.117 --> 52:35.851
No, I didn't know
it was her birthday.

52:38.990 --> 52:41.090
- I made us some flyers.
- What's that?

52:41.092 --> 52:42.258
I made us some flyers.

52:42.260 --> 52:43.559
Let's check it out.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.731
This is nice work, man.
I like the writing.

52:48.733 --> 52:48.731
Yeah.

52:48.733 --> 52:52.801
Passed them out on the way over here.
That's how I got this fridge.

52:53.303 --> 52:55.371
Look at you, taking initiative.

52:55.373 --> 52:56.839
Yeah, this looks all right, man.

52:57.807 --> 52:59.441
"Old fridges disposal..."

53:00.443 --> 53:01.877
Hey, you put my number on here.

53:01.879 --> 53:03.179
Yeah, here at the motel.

53:04.648 --> 53:07.183
We gotta get
an answering machine.

53:07.185 --> 53:09.218
And we should get
a present for nat.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.686
I'm making more money
at the lab.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.389
Doing what?

53:14.791 --> 53:15.911
They keep giving me patches.

53:16.459 --> 53:17.726
Why?

53:17.728 --> 53:17.726
I don't know,

53:17.728 --> 53:20.529
they keep asking me questions
about how I feel.

53:26.002 --> 53:27.336
You know what?

53:27.804 --> 53:28.904
Let me try one of those.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.472
- The patch?
- Yeah.

53:30.474 --> 53:32.208
I don't think I'm supposed
to take it off.

53:32.210 --> 53:33.609
Come on, man, let me see.

53:42.285 --> 53:43.986
What happened
to being a lab rat?

53:48.959 --> 53:49.959
Mm...

53:53.196 --> 53:55.231
Whoa. This is...

53:55.233 --> 53:58.400
This feels kind of funny man, it's
like electricity or something.

53:58.402 --> 53:59.868
Oh, yeah, they go away.

53:59.870 --> 54:02.471
They put some kind of magnet
or something to charge it up.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.006
Yeah, but I didn't know
it's hot.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.407
And it's cool.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.329
It's like tickling and
tingling at the same time.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.546
All right, give me another one.

54:14.884 --> 54:16.518
Ooh, ho-ho...

54:17.153 --> 54:18.520
Let me feel this.

54:21.658 --> 54:23.726
Hey, this is...
This is weird, man.

54:24.961 --> 54:26.028
This is weird.

54:31.434 --> 54:34.003
I can feel it all over
my body, you know.

54:38.108 --> 54:40.042
What is this doing to you?

54:41.645 --> 54:43.812
Oh, no, but you got to
give it back, man.

54:43.814 --> 54:44.947
Something ain't right.

54:49.519 --> 54:51.754
Ashley, my fingertips
are tingling.

54:55.759 --> 54:57.693
Come on, man, I'm getting sick.

54:58.595 --> 54:59.928
What?

54:59.930 --> 55:01.730
My heart's beating fast.

55:03.033 --> 55:05.067
Okay. Okay, here.

55:05.869 --> 55:07.002
Take it.

55:08.471 --> 55:10.306
What are you feeling?

55:10.308 --> 55:11.707
I don't feel right.

55:11.709 --> 55:12.709
Okay.

55:15.746 --> 55:16.746
Oh...

55:19.115 --> 55:20.382
Hello?

55:21.518 --> 55:22.518
Yes.

55:24.888 --> 55:26.622
Yeah, I know the street.

55:27.924 --> 55:28.957
Okay.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.093
Yeah, yeah, we know...

55:31.095 --> 55:32.361
Just give us 20 minutes.

55:32.363 --> 55:33.896
We'll be right there.

55:33.898 --> 55:34.863
All right.

55:34.865 --> 55:36.432
Right... no, thank you.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.134
We got a fridge?

55:39.136 --> 55:40.936
The flyers is working!

55:40.938 --> 55:42.338
Nice! Let's get the Dolly.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.544
- Got it?
- Got it.

57:34.084 --> 57:35.084
What?

57:36.019 --> 57:37.019
It's ray.

57:39.689 --> 57:40.689
Yeah.

57:41.624 --> 57:42.791
You seen the queen?

57:43.326 --> 57:44.726
Who?

57:44.728 --> 57:45.728
Nat.

57:47.797 --> 57:49.731
Well, I don't know.
She's not in your room?

57:50.433 --> 57:51.800
Woke up, she was gone.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.070
Yeah. I don't know.

57:56.573 --> 57:58.040
Wanna help me with something?

57:59.809 --> 58:00.876
Yeah.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.177
Just...

58:02.179 --> 58:03.745
Just let me get some clothes on.

58:08.051 --> 58:09.251
<i>You got a lady?</i>

58:12.055 --> 58:13.489
Why do you ask?

58:13.491 --> 58:15.257
'Cause I've never seen you
with one before.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.228
I got a lady.

58:19.230 --> 58:21.196
It's difficult to explain.

58:23.099 --> 58:24.666
Uh... where's she at?

58:30.073 --> 58:32.207
I had one. Linda.

58:34.210 --> 58:35.544
We were in love.

58:37.080 --> 58:39.548
We were thinking about
having a baby one time together

58:39.550 --> 58:41.016
but she didn't think
we could handle it.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.150
Hmm.

58:42.152 --> 58:45.487
She thought we were old,
or too poor, or too young.

58:45.489 --> 58:47.022
I mean, she had
some reasons for it.

58:48.458 --> 58:50.259
But I didn't agree.

58:50.261 --> 58:51.593
What happened to her?

58:52.362 --> 58:53.695
Well, she around.

58:57.333 --> 58:58.567
You ever see her?

59:04.941 --> 59:07.776
All I do is, try to get her
to fall in love with me again.

59:07.778 --> 59:09.177
Did she love you before?

59:09.179 --> 59:10.779
Yeah, she did.

59:10.781 --> 59:12.147
Then she'll love you again.

59:14.584 --> 59:15.817
You mean it?

59:17.220 --> 59:18.787
I want to tell you something.

59:19.589 --> 59:21.223
I'mma get nat off the streets.

59:22.425 --> 59:23.725
Hmm.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.327
I don't want her
out there no more.

59:26.496 --> 59:28.530
I mean, how come?
Doesn't she need the money?

59:28.532 --> 59:29.865
I can support her.

59:30.466 --> 59:31.633
Oh, yeah?

59:33.369 --> 59:35.203
I'm going to talk to her
about it tonight.

59:41.277 --> 59:42.411
That's real nice, ray.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.079
I'm happy for you, too.

59:44.081 --> 59:45.280
She's a good woman.

59:47.517 --> 59:49.117
Hope Linda loves you again.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.800
This is going to be
from the both of us, right?

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.268
Of course.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.855
What are you thinking?

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.925
Oh, she'd like a stereo.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:55.717
This one.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:57.619
This is the one.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.221
Yeah, that one looks good.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:03.825
You got it?

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.404
Sir,

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:18.206
would like to get this answering
machine and this stereo.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.511
Your total with tax is 86.80.

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:24.279
I'll give it to you for 86.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:25.347
Thank you.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.290
Oh! Oh!

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.726
Okay, sorry.

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.194
It's okay.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.063
Hey, give me that.

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:42.831
I'm gonna take it to nat
after my class.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.499
I got it.
Let me take it to her.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:45.634
I got it, I got it.

01:01:45.636 --> 01:01:46.568
Where are you seeing her?

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:47.869
I'm gonna see her at the motel.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.004
- Where are you headed?
- Same place.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.105
You can't take this with you.

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:51.306
Come on, I got it.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.474
I got it, trust me.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:54.109
Later, I'm running late.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:56.311
Make sure she knows
it's from both of us!

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.284
There you go, there you go.

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:04.286
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.888
Yeah. There you go.

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.493
Hey, Carlos!

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:12.994
You're an hour late.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.696
Yeah, but I'm here now.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.131
Do you even have the homework?

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:17.966
Yes.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.203
It's right in here.

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.906
It's somewhere in here.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.209
Ashley, I really
don't wanna see you fail.

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.412
Who said I'm gonna fail?

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.748
Haven't you heard
of positive reinforcement?

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.282
Yeah, I've heard of it.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:35.684
Then why don't you
try it sometime?

01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:37.319
Okay, I'm gonna go.
I'll see you next time.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.121
Well, you're not doing me
no favors, nerd.

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.223
What?

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:43.725
I said, "you ain't doing me
any favors, nerd."

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:45.427
All right, Ashley.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:46.695
And consider me graduated,

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.163
'cause I don't need
your nerd lessons anymore.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:49.297
That's all right with me, man.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.432
Congratulations,

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:52.067
you graduated the third grade.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.058
Linda.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.497
Linda!

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.698
I've seen you back there,

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.200
I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:27.636
Hold on, you don't even know
why I've come to see you for.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.504
You probably want
some money or something.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:30.572
You think I need money?

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.941
And if I ain't got no money,

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.376
then how did I buy you this?

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:42.083
I do not want to be possessing
nothing you stole.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:43.852
I ain't stealing nothing.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.287
This is paid for.
Straight cash.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:47.322
- Oh, you bought it, huh?
- Yeah.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.924
How come it ain't got no box?

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:48.924
A box?

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:52.527
I didn't think you want no box,
when I got you a stereo.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:54.362
A nice one, too.
A bunch of pieces.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:57.199
Why do you spend your money
on something so stupid?

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.601
I wanted to buy you a present.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.273
Linda.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.342
I hear you got yourself
a new girl.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.777
Maybe.

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:10.812
How are you gonna say
you want to be with me

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:11.947
with all your heart

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.648
and then run around
with some teeny bit?

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.818
All I do when I'm with her is talk
about how much i in love with you.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.453
- I gotta go.
- All right, just gimme a second.

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:21.723
I come all the way down here to give you
a stereo and you don't even want it.

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.358
You didn't give me
a second of your time.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.492
- What?
- Come here.

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:25.994
I wanna show you something.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.330
Grab my hands.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.458
Feel it?

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.460
Feel what?

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.929
My body getting colder.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.205
I'll take the stereo.

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.241
I need a new one anyways.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.377
I knew that. That's why
i got it for you.

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.346
Open up, it's Ashley.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.218
Yeah? Oh...

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.520
What are you doing in there?

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.890
What do you think we're doing?

01:06:01.892 --> 01:06:03.725
I'm just checking to see
if you was all right.

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:03.725
Yeah.

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:06.261
Yeah, I'm all right.
You all right?

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:06.261
Yeah.

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:09.731
Jeremy and I, we bought you
a stereo for your birthday.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.200
But it got stolen,
so, you know...

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.168
Oh...

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.903
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:06:14.905 --> 01:06:16.304
I mean, nothing much
damage to me.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.139
I just wanted to let you know.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.141
Well, thank you for
thinking of me.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.679
I'm sorry that
that happened to you.

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.915
Yeah, it was from me and
Jeremy, you know, both...

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.450
He doesn't know
it got stolen yet,

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:29.918
so maybe you could
thank him for it,

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.553
like if I was really
give it to you,

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:32.887
- 'cause he was so excited...
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:35.457
- I don't wanna him to be
disappointed, you know. -Okay.

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.492
You should go,

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.527
'cause ray just went
to go get some cigarettes.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.562
That's all.

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:43.431
Okay. Okay, hey!

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:47.035
- Okay.
- Don't you miss me, Ashley?

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.804
Yes, you know I miss you.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.072
Do you really?

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540
You're my girl.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:57.245
Yeah. Well, I think that
we have something special.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.215
But if you don't give me
your heart, then...

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.617
I will have to leave you.

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.620
What do you mean?

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.655
Ray's talking about
wanting to marry me.

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.093
What, you said
he was all ashy and gross.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:14.396
Well, I don't care
about that anymore.

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:17.832
I have to think about my life
and my future, and...

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.334
What's gonna make me happy.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.138
I can be happy with him, Ashley.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.975
So is that what you're gonna do?

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:29.344
You're gonna settle for him,
like I just settled for you?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.481
If I have to, yeah.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.812
Yo, Dwayne.

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.348
I got all these fridges
i need to unload.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:09.651
But I ain't got a $100
for the dumping here.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:14.422
Truck broke down, so I can't take them
to bedford county like I was planning.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.825
I can give you some under-the-table
money for helping me out.

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.861
So, you want me to allow you

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:22.029
to dump hazardous material
onto our yard without paying?

01:08:22.032 --> 01:08:25.033
I'm saying, I can hook you up with
like, a 20 spot every time I came.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:27.068
That would yours to keep.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.671
They cost $100 to throw away.

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:30.971
I'm talking on the side.

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:33.207
Money for you,
and only for you. Cash.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.310
I can't do it,

01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:38.078
there's hazardous
materials involved.

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:40.148
It's just a little bit.
It's a couple of fridges.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.122
You know Linda's my girl,
don't you?

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:49.023
She's been my girl forever.

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.358
But she don't talk about you.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.826
No?

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.428
She's gonna start
talking about me.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.799
Ashley.

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.533
We're getting married.

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:01.803
I proposed last night.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.006
No, you're not. When?

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:06.573
Look, now, Ashley...

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.211
No, you're not!

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.760
What are you all doing
in my room?

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.828
I'm sorry, Ashley.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.730
She told me everything.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.766
What everything?
Everything like what?

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.969
Everything like you two were
together when you come here.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.838
Everything like you didn't
give Jeremy a kidney.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.707
Everything like...

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.643
You need to get out of my motel.

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.712
- All right, take that back.
- Take what back, Ashley?

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:21.049
Ray saw the refrigerators
and I had to tell him.

01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:22.684
This is your small business?

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.285
Collecting refrigerators?

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:25.653
What kind of business is that?

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.922
You mind your small business.
I'm doing what I got to do.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.057
All right, Ashley.

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.992
Pick your stuff,
go back to your mom's.

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.339
You don't get it, do you?

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.612
I'm not settling for nobody.

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:53.014
I'm not settling for you,
I'm not settling for ray,

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.916
I'm not settling for nobody.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:54.916
It's Linda or it's nothing.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:58.019
What are you gonna do
when you get Linda back?

01:10:58.021 --> 01:10:59.120
What are gonna do with that?

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:00.788
I'm gonna live my life.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.857
What if she doesn't
ever love you again?

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.918
- Jeremy...
- Granddad!

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.486
- Jeremy...
- What?

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:46.654
Uh...

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:48.790
What is it?
What's going on, granddad?

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:50.124
Granddad!

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.026
- What?
- The fridges still here?

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:27.462
- What do you need?
- Got those fridges, right?

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.170
Why would you do this?

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.045
<i>What are you trying
to do, anyway?</i>

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.813
My granddad's respirator.

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.085
Did your aunt tell you
about the stereo?

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:52.720
I wasn't able to give it to her.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.288
I don't care!

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.257
Look, Jeremy, I'm sorry,
it got stolen.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:58.125
I know it was supposed
to be a birthday present,

01:14:58.127 --> 01:14:59.627
but I couldn't do anything
about it, man,

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:00.761
just... they stole it...

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:03.231
Ashley, I don't care
about the stereo!

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.603
You think you can keep
your grandfather alive forever?

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:12.340
Everybody dies, Jeremy.

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:13.574
No, they don't.

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:34.929
Ashley, no!

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.797
Get away from me!

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.566
Listen to me,
i have something to tell you.

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:41.168
I don't care.

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.872
You don't care about me,

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:46.607
your aunt doesn't care about me.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.311
It didn't last with my lover...

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.278
Stop.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.546
Listen to me.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.450
What's wrong with you?

01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:57.785
Follow me.

01:20:57.787 --> 01:21:00.087
Jeremy, I'm sorry
about the stereo, okay?

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.890
Don't worry about that anymore.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.893
I found it.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.661
And, look!

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:09.630
It still works!

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.734
Okay, what's happening?

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.402
Now, what's going on?

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.605
Follow me.

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.446
Where we going?

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.595
Look!

01:21:42.497 --> 01:21:44.098
I can breathe underwater.

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.112
Ashley.

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:40.014
I'm glad we're becoming friends.

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:47.321
Me, too.
