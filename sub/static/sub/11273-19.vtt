Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.637
It was your fault we lost that contest.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.075
- It was not my fault.
- We'll find out whose fault it was.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.674
- "Heart of My Heart" from the top.
- All right, sing it.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.195
Heart of my heart

00:18.360 --> 00:21.511
- I love that melody
- Love that melody

00:21.680 --> 00:24.592
Heart of my heart
Brings back...

00:24.760 --> 00:27.149
Right there! That's the note
that cost us the championship.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.596
Oh, yeah? Well, that remark
just cost you a bass!

00:30.760 --> 00:35.197
Hey, wait a minute, Jim. Now we
gotta find ourselves another bass.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.349
Three beers.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.953
You know, I love barbershop quartets.
You mind if I make a little request?

00:41.120 --> 00:42.155
Not at all.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.676
Could you give me
a little trim around the ears later?

00:47.840 --> 00:51.879
Excuse me, fellas. I couldn't
help overhearing what happened.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.032
It's always been a lifelong dream of
mine to sing in a barbershop quartet.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.713
I wonder if you might give me a try?

00:57.760 --> 01:00.228
Why not?
"Good Night, Ladies" okay?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.358
Yeah "Good Night, Ladies."
All right. All right.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.992
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies

01:13.200 --> 01:17.990
Good night, ladies
We're going to leave you now

01:24.880 --> 01:27.633
- That was fantastic!
- Hey, we got ourselves a new bass!

01:27.800 --> 01:31.634
Yeah, well, no. You know, I'm really
flattered, fellas, but I don't think so.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.553
You said it was your lifelong dream
to sing in a barbershop quartet.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.996
Well, it was and now I've done it.
Thanks for the memories.

The farmer in the dell

02:52.720 --> 02:54.790
Hey, everybody, howdy-doody.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.758
- Guess what I got in the bag.
- What's left of your mind?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.918
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:01.080 --> 03:05.153
I'd like to introduce a turnip
that needs no introduction:

03:06.240 --> 03:08.071
Miss June Lockhart.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.675
Hey, look here.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.356
You put a little makeup on her.
Shampoo and set her root hairs.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.710
Finish her off with a delicate
strand of pearls...

03:22.000 --> 03:24.878
Is it me or is this
getting a little weird?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.950
You passed weird six months ago.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.078
Now you're boldly going
where no man has gone before.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.236
Boy, I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

03:37.800 --> 03:41.839
It's a fine line between
gardening and madness.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.199
Cliff, old man...

03:45.280 --> 03:48.670
...maybe a little vacation
would do you some good.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.513
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to my office.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.274
Hey, doc? Doc, listen,
you mind if I tag along with you?

03:54.440 --> 03:57.000
Just for the stroll, you know,
a little informal chat on the way?

03:57.160 --> 03:58.639
You bet, Cliff.
I'd enjoy the company.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.995
Well, yeah, good.
Listen, I'm a very private man.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.391
I've gotta warn you at the outset. I just
don't bare my soul at the drop of a hat.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.754
Oh, I understand.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.515
Yeah, I was breast-fed a lot
longer than most youngsters.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.238
I mean, babies.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.319
Hey, everybody.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.040
Oh, hey, Sam. I thought
you weren't coming in till 5.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.112
Oh, well, I had to pick up some stuff.
We're gonna play some racquetball.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.111
Oh, Bonnie, Woody. Woody, Bonnie.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.635
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you all right?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.789
So where you guys been?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.349
Oh, we spent the afternoon
at Bonnie's apartment listening to

04:29.520 --> 04:32.990
the latest album of
John Cougar Mellen...something.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.277
- Mellencamp. Yeah, he's great.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.158
So, what rock groups
you like, Bonnie?

04:38.320 --> 04:42.154
Let's see. I like the Thompson Twins,
Tears for Fears, U2.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.753
- Oh, I love U2.
- Yeah.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.070
Yeah, we look great together,
don't we?

04:46.240 --> 04:48.993
Hey, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get my equipment.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.593
- Pretty girl, Sam.
- Yeah. Thank you.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.469
Be careful she doesn't lose
a baby tooth giving you a hickey.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.519
What's that crack supposed to mean?
She young or something?

05:05.440 --> 05:09.353
Well, you must admit, there's
a bit of a gap between your ages.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.478
Oh, yeah? She's a very
sophisticated woman,

05:12.640 --> 05:15.393
and she has travelled extensively.
She's been to Hawaii.

05:19.000 --> 05:19.989
Boy, I envy Sammy

05:20.160 --> 05:22.230
- his carefree lifestyle.
- Yeah.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.118
Night after night,
he dates pretty girls,

05:24.280 --> 05:26.874
while I sit here
and wrestle with the world's problems.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.359
You do not.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.078
What do you mean?
Last night, I let out that moan

05:30.240 --> 05:31.912
at the thought of nuclear war.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.918
It wasn't because of nuclear war.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.310
It was because we ran out
of beer nuts.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.716
It was a combination of the two.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.593
- Y'all set?
- Oh, yeah.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.877
You know, Sam, Woody's
a really rad guy.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.077
Well, you know my motto:
"Hire the rad."

05:48.240 --> 05:52.233
Wait a second, here, let me get
some money. I'll be right back.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.389
Hey, have a good game.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.118
Thanks, Woody.
I'll see you Saturday?

05:55.280 --> 05:57.396
Saturday?
What's happening Saturday?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.632
Oh, Saturday, Woody and l,
we're gonna play racquetball.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.995
I didn't know you played racquetball.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.354
Yeah, I play a little.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.711
Why didn't you tell me?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.111
Well, I didn't think
the two of us should play.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.150
Well, why not?
Oh, come on, man,

06:13.320 --> 06:14.912
just because I'm
a professional athlete?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.957
No, it wasn't that.
It was more because you're a little...

06:19.120 --> 06:21.680
I mean, you're a few years...

06:22.600 --> 06:25.160
Yeah, it's because you're
a professional athlete.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.309
No, it wasn't. It's because
you think I was old, maybe.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.029
Oh, no, no, not old, Sam.
Just older.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.277
You wanna take me on,
you little guy, you?

06:42.760 --> 06:43.795
Sure, I'd like that.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.837
All right. Carla, you wanna
tend the bar here?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.115
Got it.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.592
Sam, has it occurred to you that you
challenged Woody to a contest

06:51.760 --> 06:54.832
because he threatened
your relationship with Bonnie?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.675
No. But has this occurred to you:
Leave me alone.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.519
You all set, man?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.273
- Sure am.
- Great.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.634
Great.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.790
Oh, hey, is that somebody
famous up...?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.509
Oh, I guess not.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.318
Okay, we're off here, huh?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.754
You're not too tired to work behind
the bar now, are you, Woody?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.797
- I can take over if you are.
- No, I'm fine.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.394
Sam, are you limping?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.152
I don't know.
Let me take a look here.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.515
Oh, by golly, look at that.
It must be these new shoes.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.592
- Who won?
- Sam did.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.749
Yeah.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.956
You should have seen him out there.
He was great!

07:50.120 --> 07:52.236
You know, I especially liked
that last shot you made

07:52.400 --> 07:55.039
diving across the court.
And that little scream you let out?

07:56.760 --> 07:59.832
Oh, that's my victory scream.
I always do that when I win.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.396
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, why?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.039
Your upper lip is sweating profusely.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.760
I just played racquetball.
People sweat when they do that.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.592
On their lips?

08:11.760 --> 08:13.478
Didn't you take
a shower afterwards?

08:13.640 --> 08:17.189
Of course I did.
Maybe I just forgot to dry my lip.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.676
Does Sam's behaviour
give you pause?

08:24.840 --> 08:27.752
Methinks the man does
protest too much.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.073
Excuse me, Miss Chambers,
but shouldn't it be "l thinks"?

08:37.360 --> 08:38.918
Not in your case, Woody.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.916
What's with the skis, Sam?

08:44.080 --> 08:46.640
Oh, all this physical activity's
put me in a physical mood.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.472
I feel like doing
something else physical.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.596
I think I'm gonna go
skiing for a while.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.752
If you need help behind the bar,
Woody, call Bob.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.353
Sam, this is all rather sudden.
Where are you going?

08:57.520 --> 08:58.953
How long will you be gone?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.715
Sugarloaf, Maine. If the snow's cold
and the women hot,

09:02.880 --> 09:05.474
I'll be gone forever.
See you guys. Bye-bye.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.832
What a guy!

09:08.200 --> 09:10.714
We just get through playing
a hard game of racquetball

09:10.880 --> 09:12.199
and he's still raring to go.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.430
You just never know
what he's gonna do next.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.194
Like now, for example.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.675
Are you absolutely sure?

09:32.880 --> 09:34.552
Thank you.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.358
Oh, dear me, my worst fears
are confirmed.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.915
There's been a peroxide embargo?

09:42.920 --> 09:46.071
This is no time for levity. I just called
every hotel in Sugarloaf,

09:46.240 --> 09:48.390
and there's no Sam Malone
registered anywhere.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.796
Maybe he's staying under
an assumed name.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.350
No, I checked all the assumed
names he usually uses.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.954
There's no Lance Manion.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.751
Nor is there a Honeyboy Wilson.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.909
Hi, everybody.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.596
Hey, doc, I really gotta hand it to you
for that job you did on Cliffie.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.116
He's really been in good spirits lately
and rarely discusses vegetables.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.317
Yeah, it seems our little impromptu
session's been quite beneficial.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.710
You know, for my part,
I hope to get an article published

10:15.880 --> 10:18.474
in either Psychology Today
or the Burpee Seed Catalogue.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.359
No, seriously, it's always very gratifying
to help another human being.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.230
Hey, Sigmund Fraud.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.518
Are you addressing me, Cliff?

10:32.680 --> 10:37.071
This bill is outrageous,
750 bucks here for a friendly chat.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.835
I've had several of Ma's organs
taken out for less than that.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.913
It was not a little chat. It was seven
hours of intensive psychotherapy,

10:46.080 --> 10:48.913
which I flatter myself to say
has done you a world of good.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.433
Oh, yeah? You think so?

10:50.600 --> 10:54.229
Yeah, well, I don't think so.
And neither does Meryl Streep!

10:59.680 --> 11:02.752
- Are you ladies ready for a check?
- Yes, thank you.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.878
Anyway, I've been at Boston Mercy
for five years,

11:06.040 --> 11:09.077
and I have never had a more
relentless patient than I had today.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.550
Even when he was in constant pain,
he never stopped coming on to me.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.756
My God, it's Sam!

11:15.880 --> 11:16.949
Are you all right?

11:17.360 --> 11:21.399
The patient you're talking about.
Is it by any chance Sam Malone?

11:21.560 --> 11:24.233
- No.
- Thank God.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.436
His name is Lance Manion.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.360
Oh, yeah, thank you.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.476
Certainly. Is there
anything else I can get?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.278
Yeah. Naked.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.475
Actually, I don't think
I could handle it today.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.519
Boy, these hernias
always hurt so bad?

11:54.680 --> 11:57.114
Oh, just for a few days.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.111
Well, if you need anything else,
just ring.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.268
Thank you. Oh, God...

12:04.920 --> 12:05.955
Sam?

12:06.120 --> 12:11.513
Hey, boy, what a coincidence!
Just donated a pint of blood.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.274
The volunteer will be back.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.830
Just have a seat here and... Hey,
bless your heart for giving, really...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.956
I know why you're here.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.871
As luck would have it, a couple
of nurses stopped by the bar.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.474
They had your fingerprints
all over them.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.118
I see.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.068
In that case, you don't mind
if I sit down, do you?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.754
From this angle, it's preferable.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.679
Sam, I know what this is all about.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.150
Dating young girls.
Nearly killing yourself to beat Woody.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.958
Not telling us you were
in the hospital.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.839
No, I didn't tell you
I was in the hospital...

12:50.240 --> 12:52.913
...because I got a hernia,
and it's an old man's problem,

12:53.080 --> 12:55.799
and I didn't want the guys
to make fun of me. That's all.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.313
First of all...

12:58.240 --> 13:00.674
...people of all ages get hernias.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.314
Second of all...

13:02.760 --> 13:05.513
...getting older is the most
natural thing in the world.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.319
There's nothing to fear. Accept it.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.232
I will not accept it!

13:10.400 --> 13:14.473
Listen, the day you start accepting
getting old is the day you get old.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.950
- All right, Sam. Have it your way.
- Yeah.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.475
But I think you'd be much
happier and content

13:19.640 --> 13:23.633
if instead of fighting the advancing
years, you embrace them joyfully.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.472
No.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.513
Hi, how you doing today?

13:27.680 --> 13:31.150
- Great, as a matter of fact. Thank you.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.392
- Diane?
- Oh, yeah.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.675
Diane Chambers?

13:34.960 --> 13:35.995
Yes, that's right.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.674
Don't you remember me?
Steve McDunna.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.035
You tutored me for a while
when I was in junior high.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.357
Stevie McDunna? Little Stevie?

13:46.520 --> 13:50.832
Little Dr Steve...
Big little Dr Stevie?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.508
Yes, yeah. It's very nice
to see you again.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.955
I'm sorry, I have to run.
I'll check in with you later.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.189
Yeah, bye-bye.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.953
I'm old and alone in Boston.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.917
Sammy's back!

14:21.720 --> 14:24.314
Sam, what are you doing back here?

14:24.480 --> 14:27.756
You should be in for at least
another week. Dr Stevie said so.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.797
I got me a second opinion. My own.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.473
I'm as healthy as an ox.

14:31.640 --> 14:35.030
Hey, good to have you back,
Sammy, my man!

14:35.200 --> 14:37.953
- Can't keep a good man down, huh?
- Yeah, no, it's good to be back.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.031
Now don't encourage him.
He's rushing things.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.509
- Good to have you back, Sammy.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.352
Carla, could you cover
the bar a second?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.158
I'm just gonna grab
a case of Bass Ale.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.118
Oh, hey, hold on there, young fella.
I'll get that. I'll get that.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.589
Don't be stupid, Sammy.
You just had an operation.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.309
Hey, the day that I can't pick up a case
of beer is the day that I sell this place.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.550
Sam, what are you trying to prove?

14:57.720 --> 15:01.429
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to run a bar here.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.637
Not too shabby, huh?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.832
- Nice going, Sammy.
- Yeah.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.073
Sam?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.994
Do you wanna go back
to the hospital?

15:16.640 --> 15:18.039
Very badly.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.557
No, I can do it. I can do it.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.796
Welcome back, Valentino.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.389
Hey, that's the first time

15:33.560 --> 15:35.915
you didn't accidentally check
the starch in my whites.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.073
Oh, yeah, about that,
I'm sorry if I got fresh.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.719
Don't apologize.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.111
We nurses didn't cut the ties off
the back of your gown for nothing.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.749
Company's coming!

15:53.320 --> 15:56.596
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do this.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.751
I know you didn't.
That's all right. It's okay.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.150
He's been like this
ever since you left, Sam.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.675
Sam, l... I've come to donate
an organ or something.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.951
Woody, Woody, I have a hernia.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.714
Well, if you need another one,
take mine.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.115
Well, thank you. Thank you, man.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.840
Hey, thanks for coming down.
I really appreciate that.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.594
You... You're depressing
the hell out of me.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.591
It may be better
if you took off. Yeah?

16:22.760 --> 16:24.113
You got it, Sam.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.794
- I'll see you.
- All right. Bye-bye.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.718
Here you go, Sam.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.759
I want you to have that.
It's kind of a family heirloom.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.676
- What is it?
- A truss.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.994
It came over with my grandfather
from the old country.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.355
Actually, it came over
on my grandfather.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.713
Oh, well, yeah, gee,
that's nice. Thank you.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.599
It's a joke! You don't need this thing.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.877
You're Sammy.
Sammy don't wear no truss. Geez!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.678
Oh, that's funny. That's very funny.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.831
Yeah, well, don't pop
your stitches laughing.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.074
I'm sorry. It's just this stupid hernia
thing's getting me feeling my age.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.314
What are you talking about?
Would you stop that?

17:09.480 --> 17:11.277
Sam Malone never ages.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.271
It's one of life's great truths.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.396
Let me tell you something,
Sammy.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.632
When you're 87,
you'll still be a hunk to me.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.069
Of course, I'll be senile and blind.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.079
- And pregnant.
- Yeah, probably.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.073
- I'll look you up.
- You better.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.831
Fun's over.
See you around, Sam.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.752
Thank you, Carla.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.955
Bye, Carla.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.510
You see? There are other parts to a
hospital besides the maternity ward.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.113
Bite it.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.797
Hi, Sam. How are you?

17:47.960 --> 17:51.111
I don't even know why you bother
asking. You know how I am. I'm old.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.999
- Sam, please.
- No, no, no, you were right.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.195
You know, I tried denying it,
but it's no use.

17:58.360 --> 18:03.150
All I got to look forward to
is slowing down, wearing out,

18:03.320 --> 18:04.992
and breaking the occasional hip.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.230
Oh, Sam!

18:08.400 --> 18:11.597
Oh, I can't stand to hear you
talk like that. You were right.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.435
I was wrong. You can't just lie back
and accept getting old.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.319
You have to live each day
to the fullest.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.596
I don't know. It's...

18:25.520 --> 18:27.750
No, really, I mean it.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.675
Besides, you men get better looking
the older that you get.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.796
Look at this guy.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.632
Huh?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.199
Strong.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.759
Vital.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.273
Sexy.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.476
Isn't he something?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.638
You really think
I'm better looking now?

18:49.120 --> 18:52.874
You're a much more attractive man
than when I first met you. Much more.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.912
And there's no telling
what you may yet achieve.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.230
I went to the library today,

18:59.400 --> 19:03.632
and I found a book
that contains a list of people

19:03.800 --> 19:07.713
who made contributions
well into their latter years.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.393
Listen to this:

19:10.400 --> 19:14.552
Leo Tolstoy, Albert Schweitzer,

19:14.720 --> 19:19.589
Grandma Moses, Bertrand Russell,
Picasso, Goethe...

19:19.760 --> 19:24.311
- Oh, now, he's my favourite.
- Yeah, mine too. Mine too. He...

19:29.640 --> 19:31.551
What are you doing?

19:31.720 --> 19:34.439
Well, I just thought I'd make the room
look a little more romantic.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.955
You keep reading.
You go right ahead.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.680
Oh, Sam, this is wonderful.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.440
An old person wouldn't be doing this.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.754
This is the act of a vital,
strong, young man.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.353
Who wants a woman.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.149
Who wants sex.
Who won't get it.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.797
But this is a very positive sign.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.155
Ah, hey, come on, you know.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.438
This is a chance of a lifetime
to play doctor in a real hospital.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.589
Now come on.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.830
It's tempting, it's tempting,
but I think not.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.436
I'm going to go now and let you rest.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.034
Yeah. Hey, listen.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.915
I don't want you to make
too big a deal out of this,

20:22.080 --> 20:23.479
but thank you very much for coming.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.234
Your visit helped a lot today.

20:28.080 --> 20:32.710
Well, if we can't reach out
in our moment of need, if we can't

20:32.880 --> 20:36.555
span the gap that separates
each human. If we can't allow...

20:36.720 --> 20:40.030
Sweetheart, sweetheart, that's what
I meant by making too big a deal.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.154
- Okay. Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye-bye.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.039
Hi.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.149
- Howdy.
- Hi.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.356
Thanks, I can handle it.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.195
- I'm Jack Turner, your new roomie.
- Sam Malone. How you doing?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.634
Great.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.272
Hey, Sam Malone.
You're the baseball player, aren't you?

21:06.440 --> 21:07.714
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.677
Yeah, so what are you in for?

21:10.920 --> 21:12.273
Hernia.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.109
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.396
Yeah, I had one of those
a couple of years ago.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.110
- Didn't slow me down a bit.
- Yeah? Is that right? Really?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.430
Well, you and I are about
the same age, aren't we?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.113
Yeah, sure.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.356
Well, what are you back here for?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.713
Bone spur.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.996
Yeah. Sam Malone.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.229
I remember seeing you
out at Fenway.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.758
Yeah. Well, it looks like you've
taken pretty good care of yourself.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.435
Yeah, I work at it. You're not
looking too shabby there yourself.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.155
I can do more pushups now
than when I was 20.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.356
Hey, me too, you know.
Me too. Really.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.353
As a matter of fact,
I haven't felt better in my entire life.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.592
You know, they say a man reaches
his sexual peak at 1 8.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.517
Bet some 1 8-year-old
said that, huh?

22:00.800 --> 22:03.314
Yeah, the nurses cut the ties
on my gown here.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.199
- Get out of here!
- No, I'm not kidding!

22:07.320 --> 22:08.878
- Hey, here's my gal now.
- Oh, well.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.393
Hey, Judy.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.599
Judy, I want you to meet Sam Malone.
Isn't she something, Sam?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.557
Sure is. Listen, if you ever
wanna dump him,

22:16.720 --> 22:19.234
you can make a house call
on Sammy here anytime you want.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.994
Hey, Sam, this is my daughter
you're talking to.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.678
Your daughter, really?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.548
It's all right. Come on, honey,
let's take a look around, huh?

22:30.720 --> 22:33.439
Nice to meet you, sir.
