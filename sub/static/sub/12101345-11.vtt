WEBVTT

00:47.213 --> 00:48.965
They shouldn't be here.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.600
I have a visual.
Gobi Glie and his fighters are here.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.146
This is not right. What has Taa done?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.030
I'm disappointed, Senator Taa.

01:12.113 --> 01:15.617
Despite our new refinery
bringing countless jobs to your citizens,

01:15.700 --> 01:18.203
they seem troubled by our presence.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.579
Not at all.

01:19.662 --> 01:24.209
I speak for the people when I say
this partnership is most welcome.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.711
Wouldn't you agree, Syndulla?

01:26.795 --> 01:30.090
I will always support
that which helps Ryloth.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.717
And what about you, General?

01:32.801 --> 01:35.095
Do you share your wife's outlook?

01:37.555 --> 01:40.725
After years spent fighting,
peace is what is needed.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.895
And with peace comes prosperity.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.897
This is a new era for Ryloth.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.274
Shall we?

01:53.405 --> 01:55.198
Everything all right, General?

01:55.281 --> 01:58.535
I should be content the war's over.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.204
But change is not always easy.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.207
I hope my people will embrace this peace.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.167
Ryloth is safe, Cham.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.253
This is what you fought for.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.547
Yes, it is.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.762
Thanks to the generosity
of the Galactic Empire,

02:17.846 --> 02:24.060
our new refinery will bring stability
and growth to Ryloth once again.

02:24.894 --> 02:31.192
Now is the time for all Twi'leks
to step down from their military posts

02:31.276 --> 02:34.320
and enjoy their hard-fought freedom.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.406
-Step down?

02:36.489 --> 02:39.909
With order established
throughout the Galaxy,

02:39.993 --> 02:43.455
the Empire has offered
its valiant clone army

02:43.538 --> 02:45.582
to protect and defend us.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.125
We want Syndulla!

02:52.672 --> 02:54.758
Cham, tell us what to do!

03:04.809 --> 03:08.438
My friends, I understand your uneasiness.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.149
The one thing we have always done
as a people

03:11.232 --> 03:14.069
is stand together to defend Ryloth.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.114
When the Clone War began
and the Republic was losing,

03:18.198 --> 03:19.616
we were on our own.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.828
But when our losses mounted
and the enemy closed in,

03:23.912 --> 03:26.539
the clone army came to our aid.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.251
We would not be here today
if it wasn't for them.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.255
They fought with us. They fought for us.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.675
And they have earned our respect.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.637
I trust them to protect us
as they always have.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.057
The war has ended.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.853
Let us lay down our weapons
and focus on Ryloth's future.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.167
What a shame your daughter's not here
to share in this.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.629
Hera has other interests, Admiral.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.733
-Anything suspicious yet?
-

04:34.816 --> 04:36.067
Let me take a look.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.323
I dunno, Chop.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.868
Nothing looks out of the ordinary.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
Just a mining facility.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.832
I overheard Father say
this is only the first location.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.086
No, we can't go.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.714
Uncle Gobi told us to stay
and gather intel.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.540
Chopper?

05:33.666 --> 05:34.667
Uh-oh.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.887
Clones should not be
the ones defending Ryloth.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.139
How can Cham support this?

05:48.223 --> 05:51.393
He knows the people are tired of fighting.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.561
We can't go on as we have been.

05:53.645 --> 05:57.273
By turning over our weapons,
he's made us defenseless.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.234
I can't accept that.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.570
I've already reached out to my contact
to acquire more.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.744
What happened now?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.586
Sorry about this, General,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.755
but they were found
inside a restricted zone.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.094
We were just exploring.
-

06:26.928 --> 06:28.596
I'm in a tough spot, Cham.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.392
Between us,
things are a little tense at the moment.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.728
I won't report this,
but it can't happen again.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.688
I assure you it won't.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.064
Thank you, Howzer.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.198
What were you doing out there?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.700
I already told you.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.994
I want the truth, Hera.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.122
I sent her.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.544
Hera, Chopper, inside now.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.135
It's not fair.
We didn't do anything wrong.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.722
The Imperial refinery is off-limits, Hera.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.015
You know that.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.226
Uh, I never said we were at the refinery.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.938
I have my ways too.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.816
Now then, tell me what you saw.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.193
Leave nothing out.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.613
That is unacceptable!

07:26.696 --> 07:30.283
Do you realize what could have happened
if this was reported?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.911
My daughter spying
on an Imperial facility?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.914
Why would it be spying?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.124
What don't they want us to see?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.668
This is a delicate situation.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.213
I will not have you put Hera
in the middle of it.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.883
The clones were supposed to leave Ryloth
when the war ended.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.887
I will not stand by
while more arrive each day.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.973
We agreed to disband when the time came.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.352
What was the point of fighting
if we cannot accept peace?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.188
We've been friends a long time, Cham.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.233
I'm telling you,
the Imperials are up to something.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.152
You just don't wanna see it.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.660
Despite your warnings,

08:13.743 --> 08:17.122
Cham Syndulla's proven to be
more cooperative than anticipated.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.208
Did you see how the crowd reacted to him?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.377
His influence over them is a problem.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.046
Gobi Glie is your real threat.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.382
Glie's his lieutenant.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.343
Syndulla's fighters will always be
loyal to him.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.387
They all must be dealt with.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.098
We each have our parts to play, Senator.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.891
Be sure to see this through.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.906
Do you still dream of flying?

08:51.990 --> 08:55.660
All the time. Then I can go far from here.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.497
My dream was for a free Ryloth.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.542
For our people to happily live
in a world at peace.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.127
We have that now.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.421
The people don't seem very happy.

09:06.504 --> 09:11.384
Their lives, much like yours, have been
surrounded by war for far too long.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.761
But we are coming through it.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.221
Uncle Gobi doesn't think so.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.265
He says things are getting worse.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.851
I am well aware of what your uncle thinks.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.397
He and I want the same things
but differ in our approach.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.567
If we need to fight,
I am as capable as anyone.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.362
Gobi trusts me to do my part.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.947
Why can't you?

09:33.031 --> 09:36.785
That fiery spirit.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.245
You remind me of myself at your age.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.331
But I want more for you, Hera.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.458
Fighting… it takes a toll.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.671
My hope is that you won't ever
have to live a life like mine.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.855
As you can see,
we are in the early stages.

10:05.939 --> 10:10.402
But the doonium mine here will rebuild
parts of the galaxy affected by the war.

10:13.947 --> 10:18.660
We were told this refinery
would not be a military facility.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.330
But your soldiers and armament
suggest otherwise.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.041
Under the Republic's rule,
your planet was vulnerable,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.960
but that is no longer the case.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.672
The Empire is dedicated to protecting
the interests of Ryloth.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.593
Please excuse me.
There's a matter I must address.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.303
You can see yourselves out.

10:39.514 --> 10:44.144
Admiral Rampart cares more about his own
interests than those of our people.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.147
I hear Gobi's voice in your thoughts.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.607
Don't lose sight of
what we're trying to achieve.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.527
I am questioning the cost to achieve it.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.698
How can we trust these Imperials
when they are keeping things from us?

10:56.781 --> 11:00.577
We need to try for the sake of Ryloth.

11:00.660 --> 11:06.291
And if the Empire's version of peace
is not one we can accept, then what?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.717
You're late. Let's get moving.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.887
I can't go. I'm sorry.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.598
Your father said no more spying.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.516
This is a simple supply run.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.269
Still, I think I should stay here.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.647
All right.
But I was going to let you fly this time.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.524
Fly? Really?

11:32.484 --> 11:34.194
I guess it will have to wait.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.528
Chop, cover for me!

11:35.612 --> 11:36.613
Wait!

11:52.087 --> 11:55.840
Glie's ship's been tagged,
and he's not alone.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.390
Making our approach at one-six-two.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.392
How was that?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.602
Yes, yes. Very good.

12:07.686 --> 12:11.231
Now ease off on the thrust.
It's time to land.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.315
I can do it.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.026
No takeoffs or landings. Not yet.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.864
Watch and learn.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.450
The contact's inbound.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.553
What supplies are we here to get?

12:41.636 --> 12:42.762
Weapons.

12:42.846 --> 12:46.224
But we just turned over all our weapons
to the Empire.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.308
Not for long.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.193
I've never seen a ship like that before.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.846
Are you Gobi? Cid sent us.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.683
Along with three dozen blasters
and a case of thermal detonators.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.435
Let's see them.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.328
What type of ship is this?

13:48.411 --> 13:50.955
A modified Omicron-class attack shuttle.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.707
Can I have a look inside?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.668
Hunter, can she come aboard?

13:57.712 --> 14:00.298
Okay. You can come up.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.675
But no funny business.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.718
Funny business?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.596
Uh-huh. I'll be watching you.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.476
Okay, then. Show me around.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.854
This is the sensor array,
and that's the deflector shield.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.565
Over there is the nav readout,
and this is the hyperdrive.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.529
You sure know a lot about this.
Do you fly?

14:22.612 --> 14:23.613
No.

14:23.697 --> 14:27.826
Tech won't let me train until I can recite
all the ship's specifications from memory.

14:27.909 --> 14:32.497
Specs are only half of it.
Flying is-- It's about a feeling.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.790
What do you mean?

14:34.457 --> 14:39.254
When I close my eyes
and picture myself up there, I feel it.

14:40.005 --> 14:43.299
The instruments help guide you,
but you plot your course.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.926
You're free.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.845
So you're a pilot?

14:46.928 --> 14:49.180
No. Not yet.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.517
But one day.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.060
Come on.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.646
I'll show you my favorite part
of the ship.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.527
Up there… that's where I sleep.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.447
You get to live on a starship?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.198
That's my dream.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.743
Well, technically,
it's our gunner's mount.

15:09.826 --> 15:14.873
But when we're not getting chased
or shot at, it's my room.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.791
Who's chasing you?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.793
Are you in some kind of trouble?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.588
I thought you were in trouble.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.423
Isn't that why we're here?

15:26.343 --> 15:27.802
It's a start.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.056
Have Cid contact me
when she has more to sell.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.475
Building an arsenal attracts attention.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.560
You better know what you're getting into.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.187
We don't have a choice.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.190
Hera, we're leaving.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.817
Thanks for the tour.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.611
Anytime.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.367
Good luck.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.537
Make a new friend?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.540
She's kind of strange. I like her.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.293
Did you know flying's about a feeling?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.881
What feeling?

16:31.991 --> 16:36.871
If takeoffs and landings are the hardest,
isn't that more reason to teach me?

16:37.372 --> 16:38.581
You are persistent.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.751
We've got an Imperial ship approaching.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.545
Go low. Try to lose them.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.191
Move in.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.084
What do we do?

17:46.900 --> 17:50.612
These three were caught smuggling weapons
onto the planet.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.115
Miss Syndulla,

17:54.199 --> 17:58.286
I find your involvement in such matters
to be most distressing.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.414
Cham's behind this! She's the proof.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.333
He's plotting an uprising.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.834
That's not true!

18:04.918 --> 18:07.837
You being here is enough to implicate him.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.799
The public won't see it that way.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.843
You said it yourself.
He has influence over them.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.889
And the fact remains,
Cham has not committed a crime… yet.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.058
But this Syndulla has.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.394
Sir, she's only a child.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.647
She is an insurgent. Take them away.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.039
I'm clocking three of Glie's fighters
on the western ridge.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.083
Should I take care of them?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.961
No. Let them report back.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.130
Just make sure you get into position.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.683
We have to contact the general.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.603
Smuggling weapons? What was Hera thinking?

19:05.687 --> 19:08.106
We must speak to Senator Taa immediately.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.901
What did you find out?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.488
Guilty of treason?

19:15.572 --> 19:17.282
They haven't had a trial yet.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.244
-Taa will see that they never get one.
-

19:21.327 --> 19:24.456
We must intercept that convoy
before it reaches the capital.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.540
Where are they now?

19:25.623 --> 19:28.126
Western outskirts. Sector 3.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.753
Chopper, let's go!

19:53.735 --> 19:55.612
The tank's heading for the narrows.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.031
We have to seize control of it
before then.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.115
Split up.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.744
-Stay here and wait for my signal.
-

20:44.661 --> 20:47.622
We've got hostiles inbound!
-The convoy's being targeted.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.791
It's Syndulla. I know it.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.502
What are you waiting for? Attack!

20:54.254 --> 20:55.296
Yes, sir.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.802
We're losing the signal!
-Where are the reinforcements?

21:47.932 --> 21:49.392
Our comms have been cut.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.145
What do we do now?

22:22.926 --> 22:25.303
You must hold them off
until reinforcements get here.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.806
No. It's too late for that.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.558
Tell them we surrender.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.311
Surrender? What are you doing?

22:33.395 --> 22:34.771
Keeping us alive, Senator.

22:36.940 --> 22:37.941
Mom!

22:47.492 --> 22:49.327
What is Father going to do?

22:49.411 --> 22:51.329
Taa will not let this go.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.248
Let us worry about that.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.968
How dare you attack our convoy!

23:05.051 --> 23:06.511
You are all traitors.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.723
You threaten my daughter
and accuse her of treason?

23:10.682 --> 23:14.936
For years, I've watched you put your greed
and self-interests above Ryloth.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.481
You are the one guilty of treason.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.566
Do something!

23:20.108 --> 23:22.068
He's the one holding the blaster.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.405
Cham, stop and think
about what you're doing.

23:30.368 --> 23:34.372
Taa's time will come, but not this way.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.132
Thank you for playing your part, Senator.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.720
-

23:59.147 --> 24:01.483
Chopper, get Hera out of here. Go!

24:10.283 --> 24:11.409
Arrest these insurgents

24:11.493 --> 24:13.787
for the attempted assassination
of Orn Free Taa.

24:27.342 --> 24:30.345
The Syndulla girl won't get far.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.180
Have our forces find her.
