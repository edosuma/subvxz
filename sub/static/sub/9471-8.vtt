Philip?

01:08.538 --> 01:09.770
- Mom's talking, dude.
- Yes?

01:09.873 --> 01:10.856
I need you to look at me when

01:10.881 --> 01:11.830
- I talk to you.
- Okay. Yes.

01:11.908 --> 01:13.241
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm sorry about him, Mom.

01:13.343 --> 01:14.375
Okay, so here's the deal.

01:14.477 --> 01:15.710
- I gotta go to work.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.812 --> 01:17.512
I am going to leave Mike in charge.

01:17.614 --> 01:19.280
- What are you talking about?
- Yes!

01:19.382 --> 01:20.302
I'm going to leave Mike

01:20.314 --> 01:21.354
- in charge tonight.
- Yes!

01:21.417 --> 01:22.917
- Do you got that, Phil?
- You better prove to me

01:23.019 --> 01:25.086
that you can be a little
bit more responsible this time,

01:25.188 --> 01:26.821
and that means no broken dishes.

01:26.923 --> 01:28.556
- Mike: That was actually...
- Phil: That was Mike's fault!

01:28.658 --> 01:31.659
I know it was one of your faults,
and I don't want any broken dishes.

01:31.761 --> 01:32.693
- None.
- Yes, Mommy.

If you have any
emergencies, you go immediately

01:35.431 --> 01:38.232

01:38.334 --> 01:39.700
- Can I trust you boys?
- Yes.

01:39.802 --> 01:41.202
- Yes.
- You can leave us. We'll be fine.

01:41.237 --> 01:42.036
I love you.

01:42.138 --> 01:43.204
- I love you, Mom.
- Love you too, Mom.

01:43.306 --> 01:44.906
- All right. Bye.
- See you, Mom.

01:45.008 --> 01:47.141

- Bye, Mom. Love you.

01:47.243 --> 01:51.646
Okay, so, Phil, for my
first order of business as leader,

01:51.748 --> 01:54.749
I'm gonna need you to
get me three juice boxes.

01:54.851 --> 01:55.931
- Okay?
- What? N... no way!

01:55.985 --> 01:58.119
- Phil, Mom put me in charge.
- Okay...

01:58.221 --> 02:00.788
And everyone knows every
leader needs a servant,

02:00.890 --> 02:01.923
and that's where you come in.

02:02.025 --> 02:04.192
Every leader needs a servant?

02:04.260 --> 02:05.860
- Yeah.
- Hm...

02:05.962 --> 02:08.082
- I mean, I guess that logic holds up.
- Yes, it does.

02:08.097 --> 02:09.430
- Three juice boxes?
- Yes.

02:09.532 --> 02:12.600
We have three flavors: grape, cherry,
and also a tropical mix.

02:12.702 --> 02:13.942
You know, it's sort of citrusy,

02:14.003 --> 02:15.770
but it also
encompasses the other flavors.

02:15.872 --> 02:16.956
Oh, wait, that sounds nice. I think I

02:16.981 --> 02:18.064
- would like that.
- And it's seasonal,

02:18.124 --> 02:19.707
so you should
probably if you're interested...

03:13.529 --> 03:14.562
- That's impressive.
- All right, look.

03:14.664 --> 03:16.797
Mom said that in the
rare case of an emergency,

03:16.899 --> 03:18.833
that we should go to Mrs.
Garducci's apartment

03:18.935 --> 03:19.935
- for help, all right?
- Okay.

03:19.936 --> 03:21.235
So, that's what we're gonna do.

03:21.337 --> 03:22.722
- Just follow me.
- If you could

03:22.747 --> 03:24.229
just carry me a little bit?

03:24.340 --> 03:26.207
- I'm very disoriented.
- Okay.

03:26.309 --> 03:27.775
- I got you. Come on.
- All right.

03:27.877 --> 03:29.610

03:29.712 --> 03:31.779

Ugh, it smells so bad in here.

03:36.286 --> 03:38.369
- Mrs. Garducci?
- Oh, there she is.

03:38.454 --> 03:39.854
She's lying... Oh,
I think she's sleeping.

03:39.956 --> 03:41.222
- Okay.
- Oh, she's so old.

03:41.324 --> 03:42.556
Hi, Mrs. Garducci.

03:42.659 --> 03:45.059
- It's Mike and Phil from downstairs.
- Hey! From downstairs.

03:45.061 --> 03:47.762
Our mom said to come up here if
there's an emergency or anything...

03:47.847 --> 03:51.549
(screaming)

03:51.634 --> 03:52.850
Oh, my God!

03:52.969 --> 03:57.104
- What are you doing?
- (screaming)

03:57.206 --> 03:58.973
- Who are you?!
- I'm April.

03:59.075 --> 04:00.308
I live two floors above.

04:00.376 --> 04:01.642
(screams)

04:01.744 --> 04:03.344
Why are you screaming? That's not scary.

04:03.346 --> 04:04.845
Yeah, but groceries up those stairs?

04:04.947 --> 04:06.747
Oy gevalt! That a nightmare.
Forget about it.

04:06.783 --> 04:08.716
- We've never seen you before.
- Yeah, you live in the building?

04:08.818 --> 04:10.037
We live in the building. Yeah, I

04:10.062 --> 04:11.509
come and stay with my dad sometimes

04:11.587 --> 04:13.287
when he's not away, so
I'm not here that often.

04:13.389 --> 04:15.056
Where are you from? Why
do you sound so different?

04:15.158 --> 04:16.290
Long Island.

04:16.392 --> 04:17.925
- Oh, it's a Long Island accent.
- It was a Long Island accent.

04:18.027 --> 04:19.459
Have you checked this
place for supplies?

04:19.562 --> 04:23.130
Of... course we have
checked it for supplies, April.

04:23.232 --> 04:25.333
Um, I mean, there's a
shoehorn over there,

04:25.435 --> 04:27.368
And there's, like, four
packs of those, like,

04:27.437 --> 04:29.437
tiny screwdrivers to, like, fix glasses.

04:29.539 --> 04:30.779
- Phil: Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

04:30.804 --> 04:31.684
Those are right there.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.441
(vomits) Jesus Christ.

04:33.543 --> 04:35.343
Oh, great, this will be really useful.

04:35.445 --> 04:36.844
Wait... Wait, wait,
wait, where are you going?

04:36.946 --> 04:37.912
Don't you guys get it?

04:38.014 --> 04:39.374
The tree fell on its eastern side,

04:39.415 --> 04:40.981
which is where all the entrances are.

04:41.084 --> 04:42.684
If we wanna get out
of here in one piece,

04:42.685 --> 04:43.884
we need to get to the roof.

04:43.986 --> 04:46.454
The roof? But that's on the
other end of the tree.

04:46.556 --> 04:47.436
That's, like, 80 feet.

04:47.523 --> 04:48.683
Then we better get going now.

04:48.691 --> 04:50.491
- We don't have time to talk about it.
- Yeah.

04:50.493 --> 04:53.260
I was actually just gonna say I
think we should go to the roof of the tree.

04:53.363 --> 04:54.763
I'm actually the leader here, um...

04:54.797 --> 04:56.263
I'm actually liking what
April's putting out.

04:56.366 --> 04:57.798
- Well...
- 'Cause she sounds assertive,

04:57.900 --> 04:59.830
whereas you tend to
get a very shaky voice.

04:59.855 --> 05:00.775
See you guys later.

05:00.870 --> 05:03.104
- I'm gonna catch up with you...
- We should probably follow with her.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.366
She's a girl squirrel, right?

05:04.374 --> 05:05.756
- Yeah.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.379
because I didn't clean up at all

and now it's like he's
looking at me like it's messy in here,

even doing this to myself?

that this is easy for me,
to literally have to stare

06:09.972 --> 06:13.574

06:13.676 --> 06:14.676

What the fuck? Is she...

06:19.048 --> 06:20.981
S-Sonya, don't you dare weep.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.983
(sobs quietly) What is going on?

06:23.085 --> 06:25.119
Don't you machine gun weep. S-S-S...

06:25.221 --> 06:27.154
You know what? Fuck this snake. I'm out.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.389
How do I get out of here?

06:28.491 --> 06:31.125

Go ahead, little critter,

06:38.401 --> 06:39.900
like, wiggle that butt up that glass.

06:40.002 --> 06:42.269
Like, you are actually
perking my appetite up.

06:42.371 --> 06:43.571
Yup, yup, I'm getting out.

06:43.673 --> 06:45.473
I'm not gonna look down
'cause I know I'm making progress.

06:45.575 --> 06:48.509
Him feeling so much
hope and joy is what's making

06:48.611 --> 06:51.312

06:51.414 --> 06:53.514
I'm wigglin'. I'm getting up there.

07:00.323 --> 07:01.222
Oh.

07:01.324 --> 07:04.825
Look who's suddenly interested.

07:04.927 --> 07:06.594
Yeah? Is this what you wanted?

07:06.696 --> 07:08.095
You're sick! (laughs)

07:08.197 --> 07:10.117
You're, like, demented.
I'm fucking starving now.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.549
I'm gonna come across. I'm gonna eat you

07:11.667 --> 07:12.833
and then you're gonna be
inside of me. (laughs)

07:12.969 --> 07:14.935
Oh, my God. She's
actually coming over here.

07:15.037 --> 07:16.203
Here we go.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.506
This is what you were born to do!

07:18.608 --> 07:21.775
You're a beautiful
murderess, you fucking bitch!

Sue saba!

Yeah!

07:26.432 --> 07:27.348
Eat me!

- (sloshing)

07:30.920 --> 07:32.019
Huh.

07:32.121 --> 07:36.156
You should have chewed me
up like a normal person.

07:36.259 --> 07:39.059
Yo, I can just, like, walk around
in here? What the fuck?

07:40.196 --> 07:41.328
Is he still...

07:41.430 --> 07:42.630
This is so annoying.

07:42.732 --> 07:43.697
We had what we had.

07:43.783 --> 07:46.083
It was great, but,
like, just fucking die now.

07:46.202 --> 07:47.368
Why prolong this?

07:47.453 --> 07:49.620
This is actually kinda nice. (chuckles)

07:49.705 --> 07:52.256
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this at all.

07:52.375 --> 07:54.375
It's kinda dark, but that's fine.

07:54.477 --> 07:55.837
She'll open her mouth again I bet.

07:55.912 --> 07:57.044
You're not gonna live in me.

07:57.146 --> 07:59.213
Like, you're gonna die,
and, like, if I were you,

07:59.298 --> 08:00.898
I'd fucking kill yourself before I start

08:01.017 --> 08:03.851
turning you into poop 'cause
that's gonna be fucking horrible for you.

08:03.936 --> 08:06.103

08:08.140 --> 08:09.223
Whoa! That fluid stings.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.308
(chuckles) It stings a little bit.

08:11.394 --> 08:14.695
Oh, I do feel that the digestive
process has set in.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.696
I can tell. (burps)

08:15.781 --> 08:17.031
Yeah, I burped. Yeah, it's happening.

08:17.116 --> 08:20.234
Hey, the walls. The walls are
closing in a little bit.

08:20.319 --> 08:21.619
I don't know what you're doin', but...

08:21.737 --> 08:22.736
You know, it just goes to show

08:22.822 --> 08:24.182
that sometimes the most heightened

08:24.240 --> 08:27.408

those of following tradition.

08:27.493 --> 08:28.459
Being in our roles.

08:28.578 --> 08:29.877
Ow, my lamp!

08:29.962 --> 08:31.378
I'mma take this as a win.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.013
I'mma clean up my house now.

08:42.892 --> 08:45.092
Watch your step. There's some stuff
on the ground right there.

08:45.177 --> 08:46.560
You should probably watch
your step. Urgh!

08:46.646 --> 08:48.896
Man, yeah, guys, make sure
you stretch it out too just...

08:48.981 --> 08:50.564
You don't have to
talk the whole time, Mike.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.767
Look at April. She has a
destination plan, and she's doing it.

08:53.903 --> 08:56.186
(sighs) Really glad you
guys are coming with me.

08:56.272 --> 08:57.905
April, how old are you?

08:57.990 --> 08:58.989
13.

08:59.108 --> 09:01.442
Some people say I look
15, but I'm actually 13.

09:01.577 --> 09:03.110
Oh. Hm. That's really cool.

09:03.195 --> 09:04.411
I'm nine years old flat.

09:04.497 --> 09:05.960
Just had a
birthday. You know what I got?

09:05.985 --> 09:06.485
April: Cool.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.082
- What?
- A poster.

09:08.167 --> 09:10.701
- Mike's 12 and a quarter.
- You're younger than me.

09:10.786 --> 09:12.786
But remember, I was born late.

09:12.872 --> 09:16.290
I was in my mommy's tummy for too long!

09:16.375 --> 09:18.459
So, I'm technically older than April.

09:18.544 --> 09:20.294
Just so that's clear.
Oh, you over-gestated.

09:20.379 --> 09:22.129
You got scrambled eggs for brains, bro.

09:22.214 --> 09:24.298
Over easy, beautifully done, okay?

09:24.383 --> 09:26.016
Oh, man, it's, like, really dark in here

09:26.135 --> 09:28.302
without any of the
hallway lights on, and, um...

09:28.437 --> 09:30.471
I'm not scared or
anything, but I'm getting, like,

09:30.556 --> 09:32.539
a little bit of the
shakes and, like, the spooks.

09:32.642 --> 09:34.742
Here, just close your
eyes for 10 seconds,

09:34.844 --> 09:37.378
then open them, and you'll
be able to see much better.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.679
That's a patently dumb idea.

09:38.781 --> 09:40.661
I'm sorry, April. I don't
mean to call you dumb.

09:40.683 --> 09:41.882
Oh, my God, it worked.

09:41.984 --> 09:43.304
- Thanks, April.
- You're welcome.

09:43.319 --> 09:44.518
- That was a cool trick.
- Thanks.

09:48.257 --> 09:49.657
- Okay, that's not good...
- Shut the fuck up.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.025
What was that?

09:51.127 --> 09:52.359
- We should probably go the other way.
- We should probably go

09:52.461 --> 09:53.727
- the direct opposite of that noise.
- Yeah.

09:53.829 --> 09:56.563
- Maybe Mrs. Garducci's better.
- What? No! It's a survivor.

09:56.666 --> 09:57.765
We should see if they need help.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.067
That is not the right instinct.

09:59.101 --> 10:00.634
- (scoffs)
- Oh, and she's gone.

10:00.736 --> 10:05.222
We should probably go with
her toward the scary noise.

10:05.341 --> 10:06.640
Okay, just be confident.

10:06.726 --> 10:08.509
I heard if you do this for 10 seconds...

10:09.895 --> 10:11.645
- (chanting)
- Oh, no.

10:11.731 --> 10:13.013
This was not a good idea.

10:13.099 --> 10:14.148
April, this was your idea.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.233
- April, you talk to her.
- Okay, okay.

10:16.352 --> 10:18.852
- (chanting)
- Excuse me.

10:18.938 --> 10:21.271
Uh, I'm so sorry to interrupt. Uh...

10:21.357 --> 10:23.273
Hi. Okay. No. She's on a tear, so...

10:23.359 --> 10:25.609
It's as I prophesied.

10:25.695 --> 10:27.911
The spirit caused this catastrophe.

10:28.030 --> 10:31.415
He's been trapped in the
bark of this tree for generations

10:31.534 --> 10:35.369
and has finally been released!

10:35.454 --> 10:37.254
He spoke to me in my dreams.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.173
(chuckles)

10:39.258 --> 10:40.958
Mike had a funny dream the other night.

10:41.043 --> 10:42.009
You had a wet dream.

10:42.094 --> 10:43.293
- I didn't really know what it is...
- No!

10:43.379 --> 10:44.928
- I didn't. I didn't.
- April, that's not what, uh...

10:45.047 --> 10:46.714
- I don't know what you're talking about
- No! The other day you said

10:46.849 --> 10:48.766
you had a wet dream and it's a
sign that you're finally becoming a man,

10:48.884 --> 10:50.300
- and...
- That's not what I said.

10:50.386 --> 10:52.186
I had a dream and it was wet in a dif...

10:52.271 --> 10:53.270
It was like the... the water park.

10:53.389 --> 10:54.388
Have you ever been to
a water park, April?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.056
- Do you like water parks?
- April, scary lady,

10:56.192 --> 10:59.093
so, I wet the bed two times and everybody's
up in arms about it, right?

10:59.195 --> 11:01.395
But Mike has a wet dream every night

11:01.497 --> 11:03.097
and "it's nothing to be ashamed of"?

11:03.199 --> 11:04.455
Okay, that's the
dumbest thing I ever heard.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.289
April, is that fair to you?

11:05.367 --> 11:07.301
All right, as I was saying,

11:07.403 --> 11:10.170
the spirit is watching over us

11:10.272 --> 11:11.739
and will seek repentance.

11:11.841 --> 11:15.175
Beware to those who wander,

11:15.277 --> 11:20.380
for the ghost is aliiive!

11:21.417 --> 11:22.783
- Cool.
- You really gave it.

11:22.885 --> 11:23.917
- Yeah.
- You really drove it home.

11:24.019 --> 11:25.853
Thank you for... the speech.

11:25.955 --> 11:28.288
- You're welcome.
- Phil: Hey, are these snow globes?

11:28.390 --> 11:30.457
- 'Cause there's nothing inside of it.
- No. No. No. No.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.658
Excuse me, they're crystal.

11:31.761 --> 11:34.228
- And they are very expensive, so...
- That's so great.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.662
- It's actually really slippery.
- Just don't. I would...

11:35.765 --> 11:36.663
(gasps)

11:36.766 --> 11:38.198
(whistles)

11:38.300 --> 11:40.400
Honestly, it was, like, much
heavier than I thought it was gonna be,

11:40.503 --> 11:41.401
and there was no surface on it,

11:41.504 --> 11:42.503
so it just slipped right off.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.104
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- We'll go.

11:44.206 --> 11:45.656
- We should leave probably.
- We should go. We should probably go.

11:45.775 --> 11:47.455
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Thank you!

11:48.344 --> 11:49.343
You should sweep that up

11:49.445 --> 11:50.844
'cause that could
get in your paws unless...

11:50.946 --> 11:52.012
- Please just get out.
- Okay. Okay.

11:52.114 --> 11:53.530
Phil: So, that was pretty cool.

11:53.616 --> 11:56.250
- Yeah, she... she...
- Holy moly, that lady was intense.

11:56.335 --> 11:57.133
She... Yeah. She was a lot

11:57.158 --> 11:58.109
to take in is the one thing.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.503
- She doesn't seem okay to me.
- Yeah.

11:59.622 --> 12:00.401
Right. Something's a little off.

12:00.426 --> 12:01.229
I think she's, like, a hoarder

12:01.290 --> 12:02.373
and probably, like, a little bi-polar.

12:02.398 --> 12:03.147
Dennis: Well, well, well,

12:03.259 --> 12:04.258
what do we have here?

12:04.343 --> 12:07.528
The dork squad? Nice. I love that.

12:07.630 --> 12:10.063
- Who's this guy?
- April, that's Dennis.

12:10.166 --> 12:11.665
He's from 4B. He's a bully.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.367
Hey, Dennis, don't mess with us, okay?

12:13.469 --> 12:15.469
And if you do, I'll have to tell my mom,

12:15.571 --> 12:16.970
who will have to talk with
your parents about it,

12:17.072 --> 12:18.238
and that's just... that's
just not fun for anybody,

12:18.340 --> 12:20.180
- No fun for anybody, Dennis.
- So I don't think...

12:20.209 --> 12:21.166
- Take that, dude. Take that.
- I don't think

12:21.191 --> 12:22.033
we want to go down that road, dude.

12:22.111 --> 12:23.076
Can't do it. Not gonna happen.

12:23.179 --> 12:24.611
My parents died in the fall,

12:24.713 --> 12:26.413
so I don't have to answer to anybody!

12:26.515 --> 12:27.848
- How do you like that?!
- Whoa.

12:27.950 --> 12:29.449
- Holy shit.
- Jesus Christ, your parents died?

12:29.552 --> 12:31.585
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, there's no need to be sorry.

12:31.687 --> 12:32.953
We're in charge now!

12:33.055 --> 12:35.322
- Do you want water?
- Dennis, take a second and digest this.

12:35.424 --> 12:37.391
- Do you want to sit down, or...
- I think he's in shock.

12:37.493 --> 12:38.607
Yeah, we should get him a blanket

12:38.632 --> 12:39.483
- or something.
- He's fine!

12:39.562 --> 12:41.128
Guys, I'm fine! Stop talking!

12:41.230 --> 12:43.497
He's processing it the
way he needs to right now.

12:43.599 --> 12:44.599
He's gonna kick your ass.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.233
First of all, how old are you, mister?

12:46.335 --> 12:47.401
- Me or him?
- I think he meant you.

12:47.503 --> 12:48.902
- That's who you meant, right?
- Yeah, the tall one

12:49.004 --> 12:50.704
- I think Phil was talking about him.
- with the clear mustache.

12:50.806 --> 12:52.406
We're all the same age here pretty much.

12:52.429 --> 12:53.130
I don't think...

12:53.209 --> 12:54.584
So, when you say
pretty much, just like...

12:54.609 --> 12:55.109
Pretty much.

12:55.144 --> 12:57.144
We're the s... I'm a
little older than you guys, so what?

12:57.246 --> 12:58.111
Yeah, you look older.

12:58.214 --> 12:59.134
- You do look older.
- Yeah.

12:59.215 --> 13:00.347
There's nothing wrong with his age.

13:00.449 --> 13:02.316
There's nothing wrong with
the amount of years

13:02.418 --> 13:03.455
that he's lived until this point.

13:03.480 --> 13:03.875
Mike: Okay.

13:03.953 --> 13:05.077
Exactly. But, like, how many years?

13:05.102 --> 13:05.476
I'm 13.

13:05.554 --> 13:06.787
- How many exactly?
- Yeah, how many...

13:06.889 --> 13:08.789
- How old are you, dude?
- I'm nine years old.

13:08.891 --> 13:10.211
Okay, so I'm a little older than you.

13:10.236 --> 13:10.675
How old?

13:10.726 --> 13:11.863
- I'm 22.
- You're 22 years old

13:11.888 --> 13:13.150
and you hang out with 13...

13:13.229 --> 13:14.789
Why do you...
You're so fixated on my age!

13:14.814 --> 13:15.333
I'm just...

13:15.397 --> 13:16.427
Dennis is kicking your ass, all right?

13:16.452 --> 13:16.821
It's insane!

13:16.899 --> 13:17.747
- I'm just chilling.
- Seems,

13:17.772 --> 13:18.932
like, predatory or something.

13:18.934 --> 13:20.234
- Yeah, there's a hint of that.
- It seems a little...

13:20.336 --> 13:21.535
All right, enough of this chit-chat!

13:21.637 --> 13:23.003
- Let's get 'em, guys!
- You got it, dude.

13:23.088 --> 13:24.087
- All right, come on, easy, man.
- Easy.

13:24.206 --> 13:25.255
- Easy, guys.
- Easy. No!

13:25.374 --> 13:28.675
Lay a claw on us, and
I'll slice your cheeks.

13:28.777 --> 13:30.143
Look at this.

13:30.246 --> 13:31.845
What are you gonna do, carve us all?

13:31.947 --> 13:33.480
No, just you.

13:33.582 --> 13:37.751
In fact, that eye or
yours is looking mighty tasty.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.186
You're twisted, lady.

13:39.288 --> 13:40.554
As for you two dorks,

13:40.656 --> 13:43.123
your little tomboy can't
protect you forever.

13:43.225 --> 13:44.491
You're gonna get yours.

13:44.593 --> 13:45.525
You'll see.

13:45.628 --> 13:46.827

13:48.981 --> 13:49.947
Guys!

13:50.065 --> 13:51.331
- Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah? Sorry.
- Yeah. What's up?

13:51.433 --> 13:52.566
- The snapping thing.
- You want us to...

13:52.668 --> 13:54.201
- The shorthand to all rally.
- Right, so we...

13:54.303 --> 13:55.702
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're out of here.

13:55.804 --> 13:57.537
- That's what I'm trying to tell you!
- Don't yell at me, dude.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.560
- Please.
- I'm not yelling.

13:58.641 --> 13:59.961
- I'm...
- I'm 24 years old, okay?

14:00.042 --> 14:01.308
- You don't just...
- I thought you were 22.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.210
- I'am twenty...
- Never mind!

14:03.312 --> 14:05.345
Let's make like a prom
dress and take off!

14:05.447 --> 14:06.914
Nice! Nice! I love that.

14:06.999 --> 14:08.749

Well, what can I say?

I just did what I
thought I needed to do.

I just sort of wish
you would have let me

14:17.326 --> 14:18.825
put him in a headlock and
slam him into the wall,

14:18.928 --> 14:20.260
which I was fully prepared to do.

14:20.362 --> 14:21.929

that's been plaguing you

14:23.766 --> 14:25.198

15:40.378 --> 15:41.899

22:41.630 --> 22:42.846
- Mm... okay.
- I'm not ready for

22:42.871 --> 22:44.254
this type of commitment, dude!

22:44.332 --> 22:46.533
Okay, which one of you perverts
just touched my leg?

22:46.635 --> 22:47.734
Really not cool, guys!

22:47.836 --> 22:48.768
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

22:48.870 --> 22:49.769
If no one touched April's leg,

22:49.871 --> 22:51.604
and April probably didn't
touch your leg...

22:51.706 --> 22:53.133
That has not been decided
yet and I never said that.

22:53.158 --> 22:53.964
And no one touched my leg...

22:54.042 --> 22:55.442
- April, did you touch my leg?
- No!

22:55.510 --> 22:57.977
Then if no one's
touching anybody's legs...

23:13.662 --> 23:14.694
(shudders)

23:16.665 --> 23:18.364
All: Termites!

23:19.468 --> 23:22.302
All: Go! Go! Get out!

23:22.387 --> 23:23.303
Aah! It's on my dick!

23:23.388 --> 23:25.021
Aah! It's on my dick! Get it off of me!

23:27.442 --> 23:28.475
(grunts)

23:32.030 --> 23:33.029
(grunts)

23:34.115 --> 23:36.232
- (whimpers)
- (grunts)

23:36.318 --> 23:37.650
(whimpers)

23:37.736 --> 23:39.185
(grunts)

23:40.422 --> 23:41.788
(whimpers)

23:41.873 --> 23:43.456
(grunts)

23:43.542 --> 23:44.624
(gun cocks)

23:44.709 --> 23:45.992
(grunts)

23:46.077 --> 23:47.377
(grunts)

23:47.496 --> 23:48.495
(grunts)

23:48.580 --> 23:50.129
(grunts)

23:50.215 --> 23:52.582
(muttering)

23:52.667 --> 23:53.633
(muttering)

23:53.718 --> 23:55.468
(muttering)

23:55.554 --> 23:56.719
(muttering)

23:56.838 --> 23:58.838
(mutters)

23:58.974 --> 23:59.923
(screaming)

24:00.008 --> 24:01.508
- (whimpers)
- (growls)

24:01.593 --> 24:03.009
(mutters)

24:03.094 --> 24:03.927
(growls)

24:04.012 --> 24:05.645
(muttering, screaming)

24:07.849 --> 24:09.516
(woman screaming)

24:09.651 --> 24:10.683
(gunshot)

24:14.356 --> 24:15.688
- (all groan)
- God.

24:15.824 --> 24:17.190
- Gross.
- That was horrible.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.516
- Good thinking, Mike.
- I didn't know

24:18.541 --> 24:19.800
there were gonna be termites in it.

24:19.861 --> 24:21.127
All right, guys, cool it. Look.

24:21.229 --> 24:22.328
We've got a new problem.

24:22.430 --> 24:24.030
Do we go up or do we go down?

24:24.132 --> 24:26.165
I think it's pretty
obvious we take the upper route

24:26.268 --> 24:27.700
because the free fell down on that side,

24:27.802 --> 24:29.136
so we'll be walking on top of all

24:29.161 --> 24:30.561
- the rubble and stuff.
- No, but...

24:30.572 --> 24:32.705
- That kind of does make sense.
- Thank you, April.

24:32.807 --> 24:34.807
Okay, well, April, look how much smaller

24:34.910 --> 24:37.176
the upper route is. The
lower one is much more open

24:37.279 --> 24:38.177
and it's much more clear-cut.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.178
That's not a bad point either.

24:39.281 --> 24:40.681
I can see where you're coming from.

24:40.749 --> 24:41.687
- Thanks, April.
- Yeah, well, the

24:41.712 --> 24:42.774
last time you called the shots,

24:42.851 --> 24:44.131
we were all covered in termites.

24:44.185 --> 24:45.752
Look, man, Mom put me in charge.

24:45.854 --> 24:47.287
Yeah, well, Mom's not here, Mike.

24:47.389 --> 24:48.855
And who knows if we'll
ever see her again!

24:48.957 --> 24:50.957
Then that's even more of
a reason to listen to me!

24:51.059 --> 24:52.458
Come here. We're going the lower route.

24:52.561 --> 24:54.121
Get your frickin' paws off me! (grunts)

24:54.162 --> 24:55.522
I don't need neither of you, okay?

24:55.564 --> 24:57.030
I can get out of here by myself!

24:58.166 --> 24:59.132
Screw this.

24:59.234 --> 25:01.267
- Should we...
- No, he'll tire himself out.

25:01.369 --> 25:02.835
He needs to learn his lesson.

25:02.938 --> 25:03.870
Come on, April.

25:03.972 --> 25:05.238
April, hold my hand.

25:05.323 --> 25:07.323
- April, hold my hand.
- (sighs)

25:12.747 --> 25:14.497
(creaking)

25:18.219 --> 25:19.752
Okay. Here we go.

25:19.838 --> 25:21.137
Totally not nervous.

25:21.256 --> 25:22.422
That's not spooky at all.

25:22.557 --> 25:27.093
This doesn't seem nicely
art-directed as a scary place.

25:27.178 --> 25:29.262
I'm not scared at all. I'm confident.

25:29.347 --> 25:31.264
- (laughs)
- (yelps)

25:31.366 --> 25:33.683
(laughs)

25:35.186 --> 25:36.903
- (Phil whimpers)
- (laughs)

25:38.573 --> 25:40.139
(screams)

25:40.241 --> 25:41.507
Phil: To be continued!
