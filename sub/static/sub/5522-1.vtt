WEBVTT

00:47.589 --> 00:49.966
- Are yous ready?
- Aye!

00:50.134 --> 00:53.845
On your marks! Get set!

00:54.012 --> 00:55.638
Go!

01:14.450 --> 01:16.325
Yeah!

01:21.206 --> 01:23.291
Stew, Dr Garrigan?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.630
And you, Dr Garrigan?

01:31.175 --> 01:35.094
- l, uh... I thought that...
- Mother.

01:35.262 --> 01:40.016
..seeing as we've something to celebrate,
we might have a wee drop.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.435
- Sherry, right. Great.
- Uh-huh.

01:42.603 --> 01:47.356
- We are very proud of you, Nicholas.
- Very proud.

01:47.524 --> 01:53.029
Not quite as good a degree as mine,
but a fine one nevertheless.

01:55.574 --> 02:01.746
Being a family doctor... Well, let me tell you,
Nicholas, you've chosen a fine life.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.750
lf you'll both raise your glasses...

02:05.918 --> 02:07.585
A toast.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.961
To father and son.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.302
A long future together.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.617
Nicholas, are you all right in there?

02:39.785 --> 02:45.623
l'm fine.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.003
OK, first place you land, you go.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.048
First place you land, you go.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.470
Canada.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.539
What are all the soldiers for?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.708
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.085
What are all the soldiers for?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.005
The army's taking over. There is a coup.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.091
- A coup? What? Are we safe?
- Don't worry.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.428
These are General Amin's men.
He fights for the people.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.139
- lt's a very happy day for us.
- OK.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.823
- ls that him?
- Yes.

04:44.409 --> 04:49.121
- What do you do in Scotland?
- Well, l'm a doctor, a qualified doctor.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.708
l thought I could maybe use my skills here.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.466
- Monkeys! Look. Look up there, Tolu.
- Do you have monkeys in Scotland?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.219
No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.

05:03.929 --> 05:08.182
No. lf we had monkeys in Scotland,
we'd probably deep-fry them.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.125
This is my stop.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.883
l'm a medical officer overseas!

06:13.123 --> 06:14.457
Dr Garrigan!

06:16.793 --> 06:18.127
Uh, Dr Merrit?

06:18.295 --> 06:22.631
- No. l'm Sarah, David's wife. Welcome.
- Hello.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.218
- David was called out on an emergency.
- I hope everything's OK.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.180
Yeah, just normal business here.
Safe journey?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.974
Uh, well, you know. lt was...

06:32.142 --> 06:35.978
Bloody awful? A goat up your arse
and your face in someone's armpit.

06:36.146 --> 06:40.149
Last time I did that trip, I nearly asphyxiated.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.443
Right, hop in.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.120
- Actually, I waited for the bus yesterday.
- Oh, yeah?

06:53.288 --> 06:59.168
We were getting a little worried about you,
thought you might be caught up in the coup.

07:01.296 --> 07:05.091
lt's official now, by the way.
Obote's out. The radio's full of it.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.885
Who's Obote?

07:08.053 --> 07:11.680
- Ex-president.
- Oh, right. And whatshisname.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.433
Uh, Amin. He's taken over, yeah?

07:14.601 --> 07:17.228
You've certainly come at a busy time.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.481
Whatever I can do to help.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.677
- Morning, Nicholas.
- Morning.

07:49.845 --> 07:53.013
- So, what do you think?
- Aye, fine.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.391
Come on. Come through.

07:55.559 --> 07:59.895
This is the operating room.
Simple procedures for the most part.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.523
- Uh, morning.
- Morning.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.319
So, how many doctors are there here?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.614
Well, there's me and, uh, now there's you.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.409
- Morning, Sister.
- Morning.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.704
You know, the interesting thing is,

08:16.872 --> 08:21.458
80% of the locals
still prefer the witch doctor to us.

08:21.626 --> 08:26.881
Sometimes I think we're just
skimming the surface of an ocean.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.758
- Ready?
- Yeah.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.428
There we are.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.097
There we go. Yeah.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.932
OK.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.934
Yes, thank you.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.648
OK, and one more. OK, who's next?

08:44.816 --> 08:47.484
That's a lovely name. OK. Can I see?

09:08.298 --> 09:11.217
You ready? Now, come on, Angela.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.178
Dr Merrit.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.599
What is it?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.936
- Complications with the Mugisha baby.
- I'll go.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.939
No, no. I better go. I know the mother.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.067
Sorry.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.695
l'll be back in an hour or two.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.699
Bonny.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.909
- Jump in.
- Hi, Bonny.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.161
Hi.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.135
- I hope you don't mind me saying this, but...
- Yeah?

10:36.303 --> 10:40.848
You seem an unlikely candidate
for this kind of work.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.643
Why? Cos I don't wear socks and sandals?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.645
TouchÃ©.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.481
l still want to make a difference, you know.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.900
- Really?
- Yes, really.

10:52.068 --> 10:57.406
l wanna have fun, too, though.
A bit of adventure, something different.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.408
That's a lot of things.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.535
ls it?

11:09.961 --> 11:11.170
Doctor!

11:21.848 --> 11:23.932
Yeah!

11:26.394 --> 11:29.188
A beautiful goal for Scotland!

11:30.565 --> 11:32.024
Yeah!

11:34.361 --> 11:37.029
- A good one.
- Bonny, why are the women singing?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.699
You don't know?
The president is coming to the village.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.453
Where's Dr Merrit?

11:44.621 --> 11:48.165
- He has gone to town for stores.
- OK.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.795
Come on. I thought you might be
slightly curious to see the new boss.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.964
l don't work for Amin.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.883
Right. Fine.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.928
l just thought it might be... fun.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.308
OK.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.436
OK, OK.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.497
Amin! Amin!

13:01.072 --> 13:03.740
Uganda! Oh, yeah!

13:05.285 --> 13:07.035
Oh, yeah!

13:07.203 --> 13:10.914
Uganda! Oh, yeah!
Uganda! Oh, yeah!

13:17.755 --> 13:20.924
And I want to promise you

13:21.092 --> 13:25.804
this will be a government
of action, not of words.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.395
We will build new schools,

13:33.563 --> 13:35.898
new roads...

13:36.941 --> 13:40.027
and new houses!

13:41.696 --> 13:44.156
l may wear

13:44.324 --> 13:47.534
the uniform of a general...

13:48.703 --> 13:51.663
but, uh...

13:51.831 --> 13:55.250
..in my heart, I am a simple man

13:55.418 --> 13:57.461
like you.

13:58.505 --> 14:03.509
l know who you are
and everything that you are.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.677
l am you.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.056
Ask my soldiers.

14:09.224 --> 14:14.937
All my life, I never eat food
until my soldiers have eaten first.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.818
lt will be like this in Uganda now.

14:21.986 --> 14:26.156
Together, we will make this country better.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.703
And stronger!

14:33.122 --> 14:35.832
And free!

14:39.420 --> 14:47.553
Uganda! Oh, yeah!

14:49.889 --> 14:52.224
- Have you seen enough now?
- What?

14:52.392 --> 14:55.143
Have you seen enough now?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.437
Just a couple of minutes.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.826
- Can we please go now?
- OK.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.415
Uganda!

15:25.300 --> 15:28.385
They sang just like that for Obote...

15:28.553 --> 15:32.264
until they realised he turned their economy
into his bank account.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.059
- Come on. Give the man a chance.
- l'm serious.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.687
You talk to me in a couple of years.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.571
What's going on?

15:49.532 --> 15:51.033
Jesus.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.705
What's the problem?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.081
They need a doctor.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.589
- The president's been hurt in an accident.
- We have to come. We'll follow you.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.591
God. Terrifying.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.981
My hand!

16:23.149 --> 16:26.485
My hand is broken!

16:26.653 --> 16:29.363
Get that farmer out of my sight!

16:35.953 --> 16:37.537
Hey. Hey.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.959
Come. Come here.

16:44.921 --> 16:50.801
l'm Dr Garrigan. I hear you have a problem
with your hand. l'd like to examine it.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.392
There you go.
Could you just raise your thumb like that?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.522
- How's that? ls that OK?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

17:03.690 --> 17:08.359
Sarah, I think we're gonna need a splint. Can
somebody do something about that cow?

17:08.528 --> 17:12.698
Um, I don't think you've broken it.
l think it's just sprained.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.866
Please, it's in pain!

17:26.796 --> 17:29.840
Can you hold that there
with your other hand, please?

17:30.007 --> 17:35.387
Sarah, can you go and talk to that farmer
about his cow, please?

17:46.941 --> 17:50.277
Sarah, how's it going?

17:58.035 --> 18:02.330
- Somebody put that animal out of its misery!
- I am trying to explain to them.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.957
For God's sake!

18:26.898 --> 18:28.690
l'm sorry. l...

18:30.651 --> 18:33.904
- I couldn't hear myself think.
- You took my gun.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.447
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

18:35.615 --> 18:40.118
Nicholas G... l'm Dr Nicholas Garrigan.
l work at the medical compound in Mogambo.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.829
- l'm a... l'm a doctor.
- You are British?

18:42.997 --> 18:45.874
Brit... Uh, well, l'm Scottish.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.959
l'm Scottish.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.420
- Scottish.
- Yeah.

18:50.588 --> 18:54.132
Why didn't you say so?
l fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.886
Great soldiers. Very brave.
And good people, completely.

18:58.054 --> 19:03.433
Let me tell you, if I could be anything
instead of a Ugandan, I would be a Scot.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.143
Right. Really?

19:05.311 --> 19:10.816
Except for the... the red hair,
which I am sure is attractive to your women,

19:10.983 --> 19:14.986
but which we Africans,
we find this quite disgusting.

19:16.864 --> 19:21.034
Thank you, Dr Garrigan. A very good job.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.578
Hey.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.288
Please.

19:25.456 --> 19:30.126
Would you let me have this T-shirt?
My son Campbell, he would love this T-shirt.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.797
- You've got a son called Campbell?
- Yeah.

19:33.965 --> 19:38.134
Maybe you would take my shirt here
in exchange.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.054
Right. Of course. Yeah.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.519
Ah!

19:47.687 --> 19:49.437
Thank you.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.689
Uh-huh.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.109
You see? Now you are a general like me.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.403
Salute, please.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.951
Now I must leave.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.350
l bet you that's worth a few bob.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.561
Yeah.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.485
l still can't believe how you shot that cow.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.614
You're mad.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.826
Um, anyway, l...

20:44.994 --> 20:48.413
Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.832
No, thank you. l'm OK, really.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.877
l... Nicholas, I have to go.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.716
Look, it's fine, all right?
We're just having a drink.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.475
Oh, God.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.769
l can't do this.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.104
What?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.982
My husband is a good man.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.860
Oh, Christ. I sound ridiculous.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.700
l guess... I guess I just need you
to understand why l'm here.

21:25.868 --> 21:29.454
- lt's OK. I do understand.
- No, you don't.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.583
- l'm sorry.
- lt's OK.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.419
lt's just sometimes...

21:36.587 --> 21:40.507
when you're married to
such a very good man...

21:42.051 --> 21:45.804
it's... it makes you feel...

21:45.972 --> 21:47.639
Like shit.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.435
My father's the same.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.649
And...

21:57.817 --> 22:00.527
it's nice to be noticed.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.282
- Oh, I can't. I can't.
- Sarah, it's...

22:06.450 --> 22:08.994
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
- lt's fine.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.455
- No, don't, please.
- Sarah, it's fine.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.457
Please.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.360
Nicholas!

22:43.863 --> 22:47.699
Nicholas, there are some people
here to see you.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.494
l'll be, um, right there, David.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.705
Right. Right.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.878
- Good morning, Dr Garrigan.
- Morning.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.839
My name is Jonah Wasswa,
Minister of Health.

23:03.007 --> 23:06.176
l've been sent by
his Excellency President Amin.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.888
- There is something he would like to ask you.
- What?

23:10.056 --> 23:11.931
Sarah?

23:12.892 --> 23:17.687
Oh, hey. Listen, why don't you tell David
to rearrange the field trip for Friday?

23:17.855 --> 23:21.566
l'll be back as soon as I can. He probably
just wants me to retie his bandages.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.402
See you later.

23:33.329 --> 23:37.499
- My name is Masanga.
- Nice to meet you. l'm Nicholas.

23:37.666 --> 23:42.879
Pleased to meet you, Mr Nicholas.
Welcome to the president's car.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.720
- They think you are the president.
- Eh?

23:50.888 --> 23:53.765
They think you are the president.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.918
* Love you, love you, baby

24:22.086 --> 24:24.462
* You give me fever

24:26.841 --> 24:30.051
* Love you, love you, darling

24:30.219 --> 24:32.929
* Cos you give me fever

24:35.141 --> 24:36.975
* I love the way you walk

24:37.143 --> 24:39.394
* I love the way you talk

24:39.562 --> 24:41.437
* I love the way you move

24:41.605 --> 24:43.606
* Love the way you groove

24:43.774 --> 24:46.442
* Love you, love you, baby

24:47.486 --> 24:49.445
* Because you give me

24:49.613 --> 24:52.115
* Give me fever

24:52.283 --> 24:53.700
* Give me

24:53.868 --> 24:56.661
* Give me fever

24:56.829 --> 24:58.872
The president's house.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.628
Please, sit down.

25:05.796 --> 25:09.340
- His Excellency will be with you in a moment.
- Who's this?

25:09.508 --> 25:13.344
- Uh, Dr Junju. The previous incumbent.
- Of what?

25:13.512 --> 25:19.434
Of the post...
of personal physician to the president.

25:19.602 --> 25:24.022
Hold on to your guns, everyone!
Hold on to your guns!

25:27.526 --> 25:30.820
Good to see you again, Dr Garrigan.
You see, Jonah?

25:30.988 --> 25:37.202
This is the sort of man a president needs,
someone who is not afraid to speak his mind.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.290
So, what do you say, Nicholas?
Will you take the job?

25:43.209 --> 25:46.753
l'm sorry, um...
you want me to be your physician?

25:46.921 --> 25:49.005
Mm.

25:49.173 --> 25:53.885
- Do you want to be of service to Uganda?
- Yes, I do.

25:54.053 --> 25:59.557
Then what better way
than to look after the health of its president?

25:59.725 --> 26:02.727
Let me tell you, it will not be a difficult job

26:02.895 --> 26:08.900
because me, myself,
l am a man in perfect physical condition.

26:09.068 --> 26:13.571
Also, I know precisely when I will die.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.366
lt came to me in a dream.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.745
So you do not have to worry
about making a mistake.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.916
l'm really sorry. l'm very honoured, but...

26:25.084 --> 26:27.627
Nicholas, I understand.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.798
Me, myself, I did not want to be president,

26:31.966 --> 26:35.260
but the people, they wanted it so.

26:35.427 --> 26:39.430
Listen to me. This is very important.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.016
Here, in Kampala,

26:42.184 --> 26:47.438
you will have a hand in creating
a new health service for this country,

26:47.606 --> 26:51.484
something that will help millions of people.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.947
l'm sorry. I do have a commitment
to the mission in Mogambo

26:56.115 --> 26:59.284
and l'd be letting them down horribly.
You see?

27:06.709 --> 27:08.251
Uh!

27:09.295 --> 27:13.589
lt's the woman, the one I saw you with.
You want to get back to be with her.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.135
Well, not entirely.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.138
lt's the woman. lt's the woman.

27:20.306 --> 27:24.475
Why don't you tell her
to come and be here with us?

27:24.643 --> 27:27.061
lt's not that simple. lt's complicated.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.564
Why?

27:29.732 --> 27:31.983
ls she married?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.193
Yes, she is.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.281
Doctor!

27:38.449 --> 27:41.367
Doctor, you, you are very naughty.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.036
Me?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.832
Ah, now you are even more interesting.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.296
Married woman...
they are always the most passionate, huh?

27:55.174 --> 27:58.217
- lt's true.
- They are so grateful, huh?

28:01.889 --> 28:03.848
Hm. Yes.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.186
l'm sorry. l'm sorry for wasting your time.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.979
No, no.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.941
My car will take you back
first thing in the morning.

28:14.109 --> 28:19.280
But... in the meantime,
tonight we are having a state dinner.

28:19.448 --> 28:24.118
- Please, would you join us there?
- l'd very much like that. Thank you.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.704
You have a suit? A dark suit?

28:26.872 --> 28:29.540
- No. No, I don't.
- Hm...

28:41.804 --> 28:45.390
How much is this gonna cost me, by the way?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.518
lt's OK. lt's on president's account.

28:49.436 --> 28:52.021
- Can I just...
- Hey!

28:52.189 --> 28:53.648
Stop! Hey!

29:01.407 --> 29:06.077
- What's going on?
- Obote's men. They're everywhere.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.454
- Really?
- Yep.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.249
They're communists, you know?

29:11.417 --> 29:14.335
Mind you, Amin's more than
a match for them.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.255
He's ex-British army. King's African Rifles.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.050
Jamshid, pack those up
and have them sent to the High Commission.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.844
OK, thank you.

29:23.011 --> 29:27.849
Yes, he's a little unpredictable,
but he's got a firm hand.

29:28.016 --> 29:33.354
Only thing the African
really understands. Thanks, Jamshid.

29:37.651 --> 29:41.571
Yeah, up yours, too, pal.
Bloody English.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.053
Oh, hello.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.896
Hello.

30:19.276 --> 30:24.489
- Hello there. How do you do?
- Ah, Nicholas! l'm so happy you came.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.824
- So am l.
- Please. Please, this way.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.660
l want to introduce you
to my wives. Excuse me.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.457
This is Malyamu. She is my first wife.
She has given me five children.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.167
Uh, hello.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.504
And this one... Nora. She has given me three.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.172
Hi there.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.050
And that here is Kay.

30:44.218 --> 30:47.303
- Yes. This is Dr Nicholas Garrigan.
- Hello.

30:47.471 --> 30:51.807
- He saved my life.
- Really, I just stitched his hand up.

30:51.975 --> 30:55.478
- Don't be so modest.
- lt is you I have to thank for the T-shirt.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.773
Oh, right. So you must be
Campbell's mother?

30:58.941 --> 31:01.776
- Yes.
- lt's a pleasure meeting you.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.695
Come. I have to introduce you
to some people.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.699
Excuse me.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.703
This is British High Commissioner
Mr Perkins.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.791
- How do you do?
- Meet my good friend Dr Nicholas Garrigan.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.544
- And his colleague Mr Stone.
- How do you do?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.213
Uh, yes, we've already met.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.966
- Ah. I will talk with you later.
- Oh, right.

31:25.133 --> 31:28.886
So, uh, Dr Garrigan. We've been hearing
all sorts of things about you.

31:29.054 --> 31:32.640
Yes, l, uh... I gather the president
has clasped you to his bosom.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.892
Uh, no, no. Not exactly.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.186
What do you make of him?

31:37.354 --> 31:39.897
l think he's doing
rather a great job. Don't you?

31:40.065 --> 31:44.819
Yes. There's issues to be sorted out,
but, no, he plays a pretty straight bat.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.154
Yes, definitely one of us.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.033
Anyway, it's very good
to have another Englishman around.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.244
- Scot.
- What?

31:53.412 --> 31:56.789
l'm a Scotsman.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.586
Ladies and gentlemen.

32:01.753 --> 32:06.257
Friends, I am speaking with you now
because if I wait until later,

32:06.425 --> 32:09.427
you will be too drunk to hear my voice.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.849
Here is where civilisation began.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.643
Here in Africa.

32:17.811 --> 32:22.732
Here is where the Greeks
stole their philosophy

32:22.899 --> 32:26.110
and the Arabs took their medicine.

32:26.278 --> 32:30.781
We Ugandans
must be more proud of this history.

32:30.949 --> 32:35.536
We are an independent African nation,

32:35.704 --> 32:40.541
living in peace and economic power.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.252
- Black power.
- Yes.

32:44.004 --> 32:49.050
Just like all you people
thought would never be possible.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.804
And now we will go through to dinner.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.974
The food tonight, it is all local,

32:57.142 --> 32:59.477
special food.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.979
And none of it is human flesh.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.609
This is my last.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.831
Dr Garrigan, please come quickly.
The president is very sick.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.962
They have poisoned me.
They are trying to assassinate me!

33:27.130 --> 33:28.756
Nicholas.

33:29.758 --> 33:33.260
I just have to examine your stomach.

33:34.221 --> 33:37.515
Obote's people are everywhere.
They want me dead, Nicholas.

33:37.683 --> 33:41.060
OK, I just... I need to do this. OK?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.522
One more, one more.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.108
OK. OK. OK.

33:51.405 --> 33:56.075
OK, I think I know what this is.
Let me listen, just listen.

34:00.122 --> 34:03.958
OK. Yeah. OK.
l think I know what this is. Bear with me.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.043
Uh...

34:15.262 --> 34:17.847
There we are. OK?

34:18.014 --> 34:22.016
l'm gonna ask you
to sit on this pouf right here.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.565
What is this? What is this?

34:28.734 --> 34:33.027
l'll just hold it against your stomach.
l'll ask you to stand up in three.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.741
One, two, three. Go.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.597
l feel better, much better!

35:03.727 --> 35:07.396
Yes, you are a good doctor. Thank you.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.358
ln future, remember
not to mix beer with aspirin.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.656
- That was the cause?
- I think so. Yes.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.744
l am ashamed that you saw me like that.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.830
l was frightened.

35:24.998 --> 35:28.959
l'm a doctor. Everything that passes
between us is confidential.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.837
OK? l've taken an oath.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.965
But a man who shows fear,

35:35.133 --> 35:38.803
he is weak and he is a slave.

35:40.096 --> 35:44.892
Well, if you're afraid of dying,
it shows you have a life worth keeping.

35:50.565 --> 35:54.610
You see? You are a doctor...

35:54.778 --> 35:58.113
and also a philosopher.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.992
Yes. I do have a good life now.

36:03.036 --> 36:05.412
Please. Please, sit.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.414
Sit here.

36:11.878 --> 36:15.589
l come from a very poor family.

36:15.757 --> 36:20.678
l think you should know this.
My father, he left me when I was a child.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.473
The British army, it became my home.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.309
They took me as a...

36:27.477 --> 36:29.979
cleaner in the kitchen,

36:30.146 --> 36:32.481
cleaning pots.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.859
They used to beat me.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.821
"Build this wall, Amin."

36:38.989 --> 36:41.490
"Dig this latrine, Amin."

36:41.658 --> 36:44.034
And now, here I am,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.745
the President of Uganda.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.416
And who put me here? Eh?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.962
lt was the British.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.050
What a story.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.931
- Good night, Nicholas.
- Good night, sir.

37:21.531 --> 37:25.034
- Uh, hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.
- Nicholas, where are you?

37:25.201 --> 37:27.244
I'm still in Kampala, actually.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.413
Thank you.

37:29.581 --> 37:35.252
Look, the president's offered me a job here.
Normally, I wouldn't even consider it, but...

37:35.420 --> 37:38.255
under the circumstances...

37:38.423 --> 37:41.216
l thought it might be quite a good idea.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.596
l... I see.

37:46.056 --> 37:51.268
- David will be disappointed.
- Well, I'll write to David, of course I will.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.270
Of course.

37:53.438 --> 37:57.733
l just hope you can do as much good there
as you could've done here.

37:57.901 --> 38:02.363
Look, somebody's calling me. l'd better go.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.989
Sure.

38:04.157 --> 38:07.952
All right. Well, listen, bye, Sarah.
l'll be in touch.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.328
Bye.

38:25.971 --> 38:32.226
When you're not treating the president or his
family, the hospital could use your expertise.

38:36.690 --> 38:40.275
This is one of our new medical wards.

38:43.113 --> 38:48.492
Further down the corridor are the operating
theatres, which the president has paid for.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.328
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Doctor.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.998
Welcome to Mulago. Dr...?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.250
Garrigan. Hello.

38:56.418 --> 39:01.255
l do hope you find the hospital
up to the standard you're used to.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.468
Uh, excuse me. Who was that?

39:06.636 --> 39:09.847
Your predecessor Dr Junju.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.349
- Never mind him.
- Excuse me, sir.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.852
He's here.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.771
- Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.569
- Hello.
- Jolly nice to meet you.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.870
Dr Garrigan.

39:33.747 --> 39:38.500
Just topping up on quinine.
So, you decided to stay?

39:38.668 --> 39:40.878
- Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
- Yeah, excellent.

39:41.046 --> 39:45.883
Listen, I just wanted to say that if there's
anything we can possibly help you with,

39:46.051 --> 39:49.178
please don't hesitate.

39:49.345 --> 39:53.057
What? You're my new best friend now?

39:54.100 --> 39:56.602
Do just stay in touch.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.520
Why?

39:58.688 --> 40:01.482
Well, given that we were so, um...

40:02.901 --> 40:07.738
intimately involved
with the President coming to power,

40:07.906 --> 40:11.700
the foreign office has asked me
to point out our awareness

40:11.868 --> 40:17.456
of your very unique personal relationship
with President Amin.

40:19.375 --> 40:25.756
Should you find the need to clarify your
status regarding details of that relationship,

40:25.924 --> 40:31.929
we would of course welcome any clarification
you might feel the need to share with us.

40:35.517 --> 40:40.729
ls there some special school
where you people learn to talk that bollocks?

40:43.817 --> 40:46.902
Do, please, stay in touch.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.614
You... you take care now.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.749
This man is going to kill the president.

41:00.917 --> 41:05.462
So Nicholas walks up to that cow
and he shoots it in the head.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.883
On your marks! Get set!

41:11.469 --> 41:13.220
Go!

41:13.388 --> 41:16.849
Amin! Amin!

41:22.021 --> 41:24.314
l won.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.079
- OK. Here, Nicholas.
- Oh, no, no, no.

41:44.586 --> 41:49.506
- Before I forget... I need to ask a favour.
- Anything.

41:49.674 --> 41:54.761
l will be in Libya next week, and I need you
to attend a meeting in my place.

41:54.929 --> 42:00.642
- What kind of meeting?
- A simple matter of taste and common sense.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.395
l cannot think of anyone better than you.

42:16.159 --> 42:21.371
Ah, gentlemen. Please, don't get up.
The president sends his apologies.

42:21.539 --> 42:27.211
He's been called away at short notice
and he's asked me to step in.

42:27.712 --> 42:32.299
- And you are?
- Nicholas Garrigan. His doctor.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.093
- His doctor?
- Yes.

42:36.137 --> 42:39.556
- And you are?
- l'm the Austrian foreign minister.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.559
This is Dr Rommel,
one of our leading architects,

42:42.727 --> 42:46.146
and Dr Bruner
from the institute of civil engineering.

42:46.314 --> 42:49.274
Together, we are the first bid.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.526
Bid, right.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.071
For what, precisely?

43:03.581 --> 43:06.333
l love it!

43:06.501 --> 43:09.920
Good choice. Modern, elegant.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.422
A symbol of Uganda's future.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.051
Here is where we will have
the next Pan-African Congress.

43:16.219 --> 43:20.055
- Nice.
- My two closest advisers.

43:20.223 --> 43:23.183
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

43:25.561 --> 43:28.563
- Look what Nicholas has designed for me.
- Nice.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.692
- Well, I didn't design anything. lt was...
- Nonsense.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.444
You have a wonderful eye.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.073
Jonah... he has no taste.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.325
Look at him.

43:40.493 --> 43:42.786
Even his suits, they look silly.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.205
ls that not right, Jonah?

43:54.674 --> 44:00.554
- What is it you want, Jonah?
- I have ministerial papers for your signature.

44:00.722 --> 44:03.765
Go. I will sign them later.

44:12.692 --> 44:15.902
l do not like the way that man looks at me.

44:16.946 --> 44:20.490
- Do you think he looks at me strangely?
- No.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.201
No, I can't say that l've noticed.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.496
OK, enlargement of the mediastinum

44:26.664 --> 44:30.751
and reticulonodular lung patterns
all indicating pulmonary TB.

44:30.918 --> 44:34.171
Yeah, but it could be...

44:35.298 --> 44:37.382
What was that?

44:55.276 --> 44:59.029
Makindye prison,
where Obote's people are being held.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.367
Can you hear that?

45:04.410 --> 45:07.287
Dr Garrigan! Dr Garrigan!

45:07.455 --> 45:11.041
Please come quickly.
The president's son is sick.

45:12.126 --> 45:16.505
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him, huh?

45:21.302 --> 45:25.430
Can you hear me, child?
l'm begging you to stop it, Mackenzie!

45:25.598 --> 45:29.518
- OK. Thank you. You can step away.
- Stop it, Mackenzie, please!

45:29.685 --> 45:31.937
- Hi. Your son's epileptic?
- I don't know.

45:32.105 --> 45:34.815
- What? Has he been like this before, then?
- Yes.

45:34.982 --> 45:39.945
Right, OK. Can you hold his knees up
against his chest? The other hand back here.

45:40.113 --> 45:42.572
- This is Campbell?
- This is Mackenzie.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.075
Mackenzie. Right.

45:45.243 --> 45:48.370
Mackenzie, I am Dr Garrigan, OK?

45:48.538 --> 45:51.373
We're gonna sort you out.
We'll get you to hospital.

45:51.541 --> 45:55.877
No, no. The president will not allow it.
You must do what you can do from here.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.755
- The child has to go to hospital.
- Please!

45:59.882 --> 46:01.675
Please.

46:02.677 --> 46:05.262
lt's OK. Mamma's here.

46:05.972 --> 46:09.599
Mamma's here. lt's OK. Mamma's here.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.269
OK. OK.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.521
There you are. OK.

46:15.565 --> 46:18.525
- There we are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.735
l thought I was losing him.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.196
lt's OK. He's gonna be fine.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.994
Could you... could you
move the toys from that bed, please?

46:29.162 --> 46:32.247
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?

46:39.464 --> 46:42.924
Whoa! Big boy.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.802
Big boy. Here we go.

46:49.515 --> 46:54.019
- OK, baby. l'm so sorry. Sorry.
- lt's OK. Don't say sorry.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.480
Don't say sorry.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.566
- So this is where you live?
- Yes.

46:59.734 --> 47:01.735
Why not stay with the other wives?

47:01.903 --> 47:06.907
Since I had Mackenzie, my husband
prefers us to be somewhere more private.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.743
This is ridiculous.

47:09.911 --> 47:15.749
l think your child has epilepsy.
lt's a perfectly treatable condition.

47:15.917 --> 47:21.087
- The president does visit you here?
- He visits the children, not me.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.799
l'm a bad omen.

47:28.221 --> 47:29.846
OK.

47:30.014 --> 47:35.268
l'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital. All right?

47:35.436 --> 47:39.981
l will tell the president
how helpful you have been.

47:42.193 --> 47:44.528
* By yon bonnie banks

47:44.695 --> 47:47.030
* And by yon bonnie braes

47:47.198 --> 47:52.202
* Where the sun
shines bright on Loch Lomond
* Where the sun
shines bright on Loch Lomond

47:52.370 --> 47:56.790
* Where me and my true love
were ever wont to gae
* Where me and my true love
were ever wont to gae

47:56.958 --> 48:01.962
* On the bonnie,
bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
* On the bonnie,
bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

48:02.129 --> 48:06.883
* Oh, you'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road
* Oh, you'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road

48:07.051 --> 48:11.721
* And I'll be in Scotland afore ye

48:11.889 --> 48:16.309
* But me and my true love
will never meet again
* But me and my true love
will never meet again

48:16.477 --> 48:21.398
* On the bonnie,
bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
* On the bonnie,
bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

48:21.566 --> 48:26.236

48:26.404 --> 48:30.824
* And in sunshine

* And in sunshine

48:30.992 --> 48:35.704
* But the broken heart

48:35.871 --> 48:42.168
* Though the waeful may
cease frae their greeting
* Though the waeful may
cease frae their greeting

48:59.353 --> 49:01.396
Morning, Nicholas.

49:01.564 --> 49:05.442
l could not go
without thanking you for helping my son.

49:05.610 --> 49:09.112
- Don't mention it.
- I bring you a small gift.

49:11.907 --> 49:15.410
No doctor should be without his ambulance.

49:16.912 --> 49:20.457
- For me?
- Yes, come, come. This is yours here.

49:23.377 --> 49:28.298
- Uh-huh. What do you think?
- Are you serious? lt's a fantastic gift.

49:28.466 --> 49:34.304
Are you happy now? Let's try it. Drive me to
the airport. I have to fly to Libya on business.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.766
- Don't you think I should get dressed?
- Quickly. Quickly.

49:37.933 --> 49:40.477
- Now?
- Yes.

49:40.645 --> 49:42.729
l'll just be a minute.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.989
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yeah, very much, thank you.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.824
Yeah.

50:02.792 --> 50:06.294
So, uh... it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?

50:06.462 --> 50:08.338
- Yes.
- Right.

50:08.506 --> 50:12.842
We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.

50:13.010 --> 50:18.973
- Yes. My soldiers, they held them off.
- We thought there'd be lots of casualties.

50:19.141 --> 50:23.978
Do you want to drive your car? I want
to see you drive your car. Please. Come.

50:24.146 --> 50:26.064
- Come.
- OK.

50:36.283 --> 50:40.787
So... you do not like the way I treat my son.

50:42.206 --> 50:44.916
Uh, no. No, I don't.

50:46.252 --> 50:49.212
Hiding him away like that, it's ruining his life.

50:49.380 --> 50:54.634
- That boy has everything he wants.
- Except the treatment that could save him.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.470
He has comfort, a luxury life.

50:57.638 --> 51:00.974
Money, sir, is no substitute for anything.

51:01.142 --> 51:04.978
Nicholas, you have never been poor.

51:06.439 --> 51:08.481
What about Kay? Don't you think...?

51:08.649 --> 51:12.777
Do not speak about things
you do not understand.

51:16.240 --> 51:20.827
But the way you are concerned,
it has touched me

51:20.995 --> 51:23.830
and I will consider.

51:23.998 --> 51:28.168
You know, I like this type
of frank conversation.

51:28.335 --> 51:33.047
Yes, I respect your honesty
and your opinion completely.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.600
Drive! Drive.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.231
Drive past! Drive!

51:54.653 --> 51:56.070
Drive!

52:15.132 --> 52:18.051
Obote's men! l'm sure of it!

52:18.803 --> 52:21.846
lf I had not been in your car...

52:23.140 --> 52:26.643
lt is in my dream. They cannot kill me.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.853
lt is in my dream.

52:34.318 --> 52:37.737
Somebody told his men my travel plans.

52:39.114 --> 52:41.658
Somebody has betrayed me.

52:42.576 --> 52:45.411
l cannot trust anybody.

52:46.539 --> 52:49.123
l'm surrounded by traitors!

52:58.050 --> 53:00.593
Masanga.

53:01.470 --> 53:03.721
Nicholas. Nicholas.

53:04.265 --> 53:06.474
- You know Masanga.
- Uh-huh.

53:06.642 --> 53:08.935
He is one of my people.

53:09.103 --> 53:13.189
He will handle
all of my security matters from now on.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.816
Yes, sir.

53:14.984 --> 53:20.071
- You will take care of me and this country.
- Yes, sir.

53:22.408 --> 53:24.534
Where is Jonah Wasswa?!

53:24.702 --> 53:28.413
Where is he? I need my minister.

53:28.581 --> 53:33.543
A minister should be by his president's side.

53:33.711 --> 53:36.462
- Where is he?!
- I don't know.

53:37.506 --> 53:42.468
And you call yourself my closest adviser.

53:44.388 --> 53:46.347
Huh?

53:53.981 --> 54:00.320
You see? You see? These loyal soldiers,
already they have captured the criminals.

54:26.138 --> 54:28.848
Do not pity them, Nicholas.

54:29.016 --> 54:33.102
These men here, they wanted you dead.

54:35.981 --> 54:39.233
Why did you try to kill me?

54:39.401 --> 54:41.027
Huh?

54:42.196 --> 54:46.449
l will not die until I say.

54:49.495 --> 54:52.997
Look at me.

55:00.506 --> 55:02.590
Huh?

55:02.758 --> 55:06.010
You work for him! Obote!

55:06.178 --> 55:07.261
Huh?!

55:07.429 --> 55:11.641
That... that... drunk, silly man!

55:11.809 --> 55:16.145
You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?!

55:16.313 --> 55:18.147
Huh?!

55:23.278 --> 55:25.571
Uganda loves me...

55:26.991 --> 55:29.784
because I am loyal...

55:30.828 --> 55:33.705
and I am fair.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.837
l am your president.

55:50.014 --> 55:54.350
Come, Nicholas. This is no place for us.

56:30.971 --> 56:33.890
* Busted flat in Baton Rouge

56:34.058 --> 56:35.641
* Waiting for a train

56:35.809 --> 56:40.063
* And l's feeling nearly as faded as my jeans

56:41.106 --> 56:43.816
* Bobby thumbed a diesel down

56:43.984 --> 56:45.735
* Just before it rained

56:45.903 --> 56:50.323
* lt rode us all the way to New Orleans

56:50.491 --> 56:55.495
* I pulled my harpoon
out of my dirty red bandanna
* I pulled my harpoon
out of my dirty red bandanna

56:55.662 --> 56:59.373
* l'm playing soft
while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
* l'm playing soft
while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

57:00.667 --> 57:05.213
* Windshield wipers slapping time
l'm holding Bobby's hand in mine
* Windshield wipers slapping time
l'm holding Bobby's hand in mine

57:05.380 --> 57:09.926
* We sang every song that driver knew, yeah

57:10.385 --> 57:15.223
* Freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose
* Freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose

57:15.390 --> 57:20.061
* Nothing don't mean nothing,
honey, if it ain't free, no, no
* Nothing don't mean nothing,
honey, if it ain't free, no, no

57:20.229 --> 57:25.149
* Feeling good was easy, Lord,
when he sang the blues
* Feeling good was easy, Lord,
when he sang the blues

57:25.317 --> 57:29.070
* Feeling good was good enough for me

57:30.114 --> 57:33.157
* Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

57:42.251 --> 57:47.672
These, I can read you later. And the rest,
that's just pro forma papers for you to sign.

57:47.840 --> 57:54.053
Um, l've left a small list of medical equipment
at the end for my old surgery in Mogambo.

58:04.314 --> 58:06.649
ls there anything else, Nicholas?

58:12.865 --> 58:14.991
Eh?

58:16.994 --> 58:19.287
Nicholas.

58:20.122 --> 58:22.623
lt's probably nothing, sir.

58:26.712 --> 58:28.588
What?

58:31.967 --> 58:34.218
Nicholas,

58:34.386 --> 58:38.181
you are my closest adviser.

58:38.348 --> 58:42.268
Please, tell me what is on your mind.

58:49.735 --> 58:54.197
Last night, I went to the Holiday lnn
and had a drink.

58:55.324 --> 59:00.369
And I saw Jonah Wasswa there
speaking to some white guy in the bar.

59:00.537 --> 59:04.457
Something about it just didn't seem right.

59:04.625 --> 59:07.210
lt's, uh... it's probably nothing,

59:07.377 --> 59:09.795
but you might wanna have a talk with him.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.423
Just... just a talk.

59:15.469 --> 59:18.346
Like I say, it's probably nothing.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.855
Good night, sir.

59:50.379 --> 59:52.338
Ah, how are you?

59:52.506 --> 59:56.509
- Very well. How are you?
- l'm very well.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.309
That is very good, Mackenzie.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.901
- Very good. Go show your brother.
- OK.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.783
Hiya.

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:25.579
Hi, ya.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.085
He's looking much better.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:34.130
Much better.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:39.135
That other one is Campbell.
He is the one who got your T-shirt.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:42.179
You're a man of taste.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.641
Mummy! Mummy!

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.644
- Please... goodbye.
- OK.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.647
- He keeps pushing me, Mummy!
- OK, stop it.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.983
Stop it, Mackenzie.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.152
Garrigan.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:02.199
- Daydreaming?
- Well, looking at you, Stone, I hope so.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:07.163
l thought you'd be with the president
on his trip to London.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:12.168
- No. l'm needed here.
- I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:15.171
- What?
- I was reading this article in the Times.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.173
l don't know if you've seen it.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:21.177
lt seems a judge who ruled
against Amin has gone missing.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:25.890
- He hasn't been seen for five days.
- l'm sure there's a logical explanation.

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:31.187
Well, the thing is, we've been getting reports
up and down the country of the same thing -

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.523
people speaking out against the regime

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.318
just, uh... disappearing.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:41.113
No. lf you're gonna accuse the president,
just come out and say it.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:45.534
l was just hoping you might be able to
give us a little clarification.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.580
Fuck your clarifications, Stone! Fuck them!

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.833
You people amaze me, you know.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:57.338
The first sign of an independent leader
achieving something, what do you do?

01:01:57.506 --> 01:02:01.967
You spit your dummy because you can't
stand the idea that he's done it without you.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.678
l know he's a bit rough,
but what do you expect?

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:09.892
Do you think Obote's people
are sitting around waiting for clarifications?

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.061
Look at me.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.731
This is Africa.
You meet violence with violence.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.234
Anything else and you're dead.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:22.238
Then perhaps you'd be so kind
as to explain to me

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:26.200
the whereabouts of Health Minister Wasswa.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.495
What?

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:32.540
Well, he's, uh... he's missing, too.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:37.461
But, as you say, l'm sure
there's some perfectly normal explanation.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:43.217
l'm, uh... having drinks later
with the man who wrote the article.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:48.347
Perhaps you'd like to join us,
shed some light on the matter.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:51.016
- Fine. I will.
- About six o'clockish?

01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:00.025
- Can I help?
- I need to see the minister.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.736
l'm afraid she's busy.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.132
You were right.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.885
The health minister has gone missing.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:29.889
- Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.
- What? Jonah Wasswa?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.390
Mm.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:35.311
He's embezzled several
hundred thousand pounds of ministry funds.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:39.648
Some people are suggesting
that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:45.446
- I find that very hard to believe.
- He was sealing a major pharmaceutical deal.

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:49.992
Life-saving penicillin for the masses.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.497
l should know. I set up the meeting
with his South African counterpart

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.833
at, um, the Holiday lnn.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.463
So, this embezzlement,

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:05.424
is it on the record?

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:09.720
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- And I can quote you in the paper?

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:13.849
- l'm sorry, quote me?
- Not directly, of course.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.060
As a government spokesman.

01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:18.854
Government spokesman?

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.523
OK.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.774
Mr President.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:07.903
l've come to say goodbye.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.447
l'm going home.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:13.993
Mr President.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.911
Boo!

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.500
l got you! I got him!

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:27.631
Nicholas, meet my body double, Muyenga.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:31.427
Look at him. Everything the same, except...

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:35.764
What do you say, Nicholas?
ls he as handsome as me?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.684
- No. No he's not.
- Aha! You see?

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:43.772
You see? Nicholas agrees.
You are much more ugly than me, Muyenga.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:50.029
Look. Look, Nicholas. I have others also.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:55.701
All part of Captain Masanga's plan
for my security.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:00.748
- Clever, huh?
- Yep.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.890
Nicholas.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:24.063
My Nicholas.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:31.820
What is all this about your going home?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.614
Hm?

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:45.084
You once told me that you respected me
because I wasn't afraid to speak my mind.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.753
Mm. Speak.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.426
lt's this business with Wasswa.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.596
l can't.

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:04.353
lt fucking stinks. I can't help going back to
that moment when I asked you to talk to him.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.522
This isn't me.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.650
l have to go home now.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.528
You cannot.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:17.449
- What?
- Your work is not finished here yet.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:20.452
But I didn't come here to finish anything.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:25.165
You promised to me
that you would help to build a new Uganda.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.876
You swore an oath.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:32.881
The oath is, um... lt's a doctor's oath
of confidentiality. We all take it.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:37.386
- lt's got nothing to do with Uganda.
- Huh? Nothing?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.389
Nothing comes from nothing.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:44.893
You have a conscience. I know you do.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.731
That is why you came here in the first place.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.109
Or are you like all the other British?

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:58.323
Just here to fuck and to take away?

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:03.162
No.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:07.332
Why else would I trust you with my family?

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:14.548
You are like my own son.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.928
l'm Nicholas Garrigan.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.307
And l'm from Scotland.
lt's my home. I want to...

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:26.560
Your home is here.

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:29.938
Please. Just... Please.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.232
Do not be a silly boy.

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:38.322
lf you go now, what will they think
about you and Jonah Wasswa?

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:43.368
What are you talking about?
l said... I said talk to him.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:47.622
Do not pretend to yourself
that you did not know.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.751
You are a stronger man than that.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.130
l didn't want him to die, though.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.926
But you... you did it.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:05.808
- Why? You want to know why?
- Mm-hm.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.937
You did it because...

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.397
you love me.

01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:18.904
You have stepped
deep into the heart of my country.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:22.616
Uganda...

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.037
Uganda embraces you.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:37.589
Nicholas.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.801
What you need is to have some fun.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:16.211
Hey, Nicholas. Where have you been?

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.922
- I want you to meet Betty.
- Betty.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.842
And this here is her sister Joy.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.552
Joy.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.180
Joy is going to look after you this weekend.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:30.392
Joy...

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.477
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:36.106
And now, let the games begin.

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.737
Yes.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:46.658
Nicholas, you didn't know
we had Ugandan cowboys, huh?

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.120
Finance minister.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.753
Come here!

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:39.336
Can I have another whisky, please?

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:51.473
Well, let me tell you,
Nicholas, you've chosen a fine life.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.853
You want to kill me
for that drunk, silly man?!

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:01.525
Nicholas.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.610
Nicholas.

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.785
Dr Garrigan.

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:22.796
Jesus fucking Christ, you look so lovely.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:29.428
You know something? I shouldn't be here.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.848
l should be in Scotland with my dad.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:38.353
l should be looking after little old ladies
cos here l've fucked up.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:42.024
- Kay, I fucked up! I fucked up.
- Uh-uh.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.401
Not here.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.156
- Walk with me.
- What?

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:51.366
Walk with me.

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:11.887
l'm fucking doomed!

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:16.475
Do you know he's got
go-go dancers after me now?

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.727
Where are we going?

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.688
l don't know.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:26.234
- Nicky !
- Oh, shit! lt's the go-go dancer.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.820
Nicky!

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.364
Through here. Come on.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.617
Just follow me.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.720
Fuck it!

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.406
He has always been like this.

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:57.742
He just chose not to show you until now.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.999
Nicholas.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.918
You have to find a way to get out.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:10.130
He still listens to me.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:16.303
He cannot trust anybody any more.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:20.807
l'll wait, until things get really bad.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.851
They are.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.103
Really bad.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.486
Huh?

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.447
- Nothing.
- What?

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:37.991
- Nothing.
- What?

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:45.123
l just had this mad image of me and you
sitting at my mother and father's dinner table.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.125
Ah.

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:52.923
"More stew, Mrs Amin?"

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:03.225
Nicholas.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.518
You've got to get out.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.568
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.863
What if somebody saw us?

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:19.699
OK.

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:23.995
- Just wait two minutes and then come out.
- Yeah.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.624
Go! Go, go, go!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:35.877
Shit.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.228
Dr Garrigan.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.688
lt's four in the morning.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.982
Can I have a word with you?

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.697
- Whisky?
- OK.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.458
They've, uh...

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:18.378
they've taken my passport.

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:24.092
You were saying that
if there was ever anything you could do.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.928
l need to get out of here while I still can.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:32.600
l was hoping
you might be able to help in that.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:36.312
- Please.
- "Please." That's a nice touch.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:44.404
Have you any idea
what's going on in this country, Dr Garrigan?

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.449
Some.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.952
ln the countryside,
they're not even bothering to dig graves.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.081
They're simply feeding them
to the crocodiles.

01:19:55.249 --> 01:20:01.838
Right here in Kampala, right under our noses,
he's wiped out the entire political opposition.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:08.511
Thousands of Acholi and Langi tribesmen
from the army.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.807
He's hardly even bothering
to cover it up any more.

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.772
Even members of his own cabinet.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.443
Your friend, the health minister.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:34.037
This is a man who was actually
trying to help his country.

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:39.250
ldi always seems to get it wrong, doesn't he?

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:43.630
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.301
Get me out of here.

01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:51.471
You earn your passage first.

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:54.098
Wh... what?

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.437
You know what they're calling you?

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:02.524
His white monkey.

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:06.319
l'm his doctor!

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:09.989
- lt's not my job to judge the man.
- "l'm his doctor."

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:15.203
ls that your defence?
How pathetic. Fuck off, Garrigan.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:19.165
We don't just hand out passports
to chimps like you.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:24.671
Particularly not chimps
with blood on their hands.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:27.882
Look, you, l'm a citizen and I have rights.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:33.596
Fuck your rights.
You do as I say or you don't get out of here.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:38.476
You're his doctor.
You have unprecedented access to him.

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:41.563
Obviously, we'd help you with...

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.984
anything you needed.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:51.155
You want me to kill him?

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:36.242
Amidst rumours of
human-rights violations and mismanagement,

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:41.289
- the situation in Uganda has deteriorated...
- ..la dÃ©cision politique...

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:45.460
..ten hospitals has had to be
deferred and the rest of those...

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:48.421
Es kursieren
stÃ¤ndig GerÃ¼chte Ã¼ber...

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:52.425
Getting any information
from the country has become harder.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:56.638
..has accused the British
of attempting to assassinate him.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:00.058
..and his policies
are growing more unpredictable.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:04.354
The British government
has broken its promises to Uganda.

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:11.736
Because of this, I have decided
to expel all Asians from this country.

01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:14.530
And these people, they are leeches.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:19.702
They milk the cow,
but they do not want to feed the cow.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.790
No longer. They have 90 days to leave.

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:34.967
They are too sick to leave.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:40.431
Take your hands off him! How dare you?

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:45.103
l don't care where you get your orders from!
You cannot come into a hospital...

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:48.189
They're forcing our sick relatives to leave.

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:04.831
This is a hospital!

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:07.875
You get your men out of here now!

01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:27.520
l'm complaining personally to the president!

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.648
You all right?

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:36.195
l'll see to this.

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:41.909
You're trying to help your people,
l understand that, but Uganda isn't ready, sir.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.288
You expel the Asians now,
this economy will be on its knees,

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:51.169
not to mention the damage you'll do
to your reputation abroad.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:55.089
ls that what you came here for?

01:24:56.258 --> 01:25:01.179
To plead for your fucking Asian tailor?

01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:05.391
These things do not concern you.

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:09.687
You are nothing but a doctor.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.523
You are a nobody.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.029
Get out.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:21.199
Get out!

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:52.313
Sarah!

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:18.464
Hello.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:23.302
- What have we done?
- Who...? Kay, is that you?

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:28.182
He is going to kill us, Nicholas!
He is going to kill us!

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:33.354
I have to get it out of me.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:37.024
He will kill me, Nicholas.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.819
l have to get it out.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:45.157
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:52.415
l want you to do it. Please.
You're a doctor. I know you can do it.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:55.543
- I know you can do it, Nicholas.
- No, we can't.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:58.588
l can't do that!

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:04.552
This isn't some simple procedure.
lt has to be done under clinical conditions.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.221
l have to...

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:11.517
lf you don't do something now,
l'm going to have to find a place to go.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:15.229
l'll have to get it done in one of the villages.
ls that what you want?

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.440
No, you don't.

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:23.404
Come here. Whatever you do,
you don't do that. All right?

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.699
l'm gonna sort something out. Just...

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:29.785
promise me you'll stay in the house.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:34.040
Please promise me you'll stay in the house.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.213
Prom... promise me this...

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:44.050
promise this is going to be all right.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:45.968
l promise.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:48.679
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:52.767
- Kay Amin?
- Mm-hm.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:55.519
- The president's wife?
- Yes.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:02.360
- We couldn't do that here, not at Mulago.
- Why not?

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:05.780
lt's the president's hospital!
He's bound to find out.

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:08.574
- We could do this discreetly.
- No!

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:13.120
He would kill her and us.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:16.290
- lt's too much to risk.
- What choice does she have?

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:19.794
Some backstreet job in a village somewhere?

01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:23.464
Come on, Thomas!
You know what that means.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.301
lt's the only choice you've left her.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:32.640
But I don't expect
it crossed your mind to wonder, eh?

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.935
A white man with a black woman.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:40.523
What does she need with such things?

01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:43.401
Fine.

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:45.736
l'll do it myself.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.461
The president wants to see you. Now.

01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:23.816
My head is exploding! l... l...

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:29.030
l can't think! I can't sleep!
Look at this! Look at this!

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:33.492
The British newspapers say I am a madman!

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:38.164
The American newspapers
say I am a cannibal!

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.958
l am a cannibal, huh? Huh?

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:45.379
These are lies!
l should throw them out for good!

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.965
Only Ugandan press from now on!

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:50.384
- You want something for the headache?
- No.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:56.098
- Something to help you sleep, perhaps?
- Later. I want you to tell me what to do.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:30:00.227
- You want me to tell you what to do?
- Yes. You are my adviser.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:03.481
You are the only one I can trust in here.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:07.485
You should've told me
not to throw the Asians out in the first place!

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.030
- I did!
- But you did not persuade me, Nicholas.

01:30:11.198 --> 01:30:14.408
You did not persuade me!

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.160
Huh?

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:21.332
Tell me what to do here.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:33.677
Don't throw the journalists out.
They're only gonna write more lies about you.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:37.723
You invite them to meet you face to face.

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:39.934
You charm them.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:46.440
You show them what kind of a man you are.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.112
Hm.

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:56.450
You think this will work?

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:59.745
l think that's the Amin they need to see.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.583
Thank you.

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:07.169
Thank you very much, Nicholas.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:10.673
What would I do without my Nicholas, eh?

01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:13.926
What would I do
without my Nicholas?

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:23.185
ls there something going on here? Huh?

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:25.813
No. No.

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.318
No.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:32.820
- ls there?
- No.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:36.157
- Huh?
- No.

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.201
- Are you sure, Nicholas?
- Yes.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:42.246
Yes.

01:31:45.876 --> 01:31:50.045
Give me a booster,
something to make me feel strong again.

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.032
Sir.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:23.621
- Where are you going, Nicholas?
- I have something that I have to attend to.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.831
Uh-uh. No.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:31.754
You have to stay here.
l need you for the press conference.

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:47.353
This is all very well, your Excellency,
but what about the reports of mass killings?

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.357
Who have you been talking with?
The British?

01:32:51.524 --> 01:32:56.320
Go. Look around Uganda for missing people.
Go anywhere you please.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.990
So, why would the British
spread these rumours?

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:06.372
- Yeah.
- Because they hate me.

01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:10.709
Because I refuse to recognise South Africa,

01:33:10.877 --> 01:33:14.421
a racist regime that they support.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:18.259
- Also, they are jealous of me.
- Why?

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:22.680
Because while they are starving
with their strikes and with their protests,

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:28.227
the people of Uganda
are eating beef and driving big cars.

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:35.442
l have created the Save Britain Fund.

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:39.446
We Ugandans, we like to help friends,
so the Ugandans have got together

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:43.450
and saved three tons of food and vegetables

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.328
for their friends in England.

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:52.459
Because they are having
economic difficulties, let me assure you here.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:08.517
Kay.

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:12.187
Kay, it's OK. lt's Nick.

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:17.151
- What?
- l'm sorry.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:19.403
She went to the village.

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:22.823
They had to take her to hospital!

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:30.664
lt's been reported that you
crowned yourself the last king of Scotland.

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:36.503
My good friends the Scottish people have
seen how I have defeated the English here

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:40.841
and they want me
to do the same for them there.

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:50.184
Yeah. This woman here.

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:56.023
Did you write to the queen of England,
offering yourself as a lover?

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:59.026
You are... you are very cheeky!

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.546
And this is what happens
when you betray the president.

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:04.842
This is what happens when you betray him.

01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:05.152
I'm not. I enjoy it.
l could spend the rest of my life getting laid.

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:20.083
There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:39.269
They say she has a clitoris
halfway down her throat.

01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.438
ls this possible?

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:43.649
Medically?

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:48.904
Almost all aberrations of nature are possible.

01:37:52.033 --> 01:37:55.786
l made an example of her

01:37:55.954 --> 01:37:58.413
because she betrayed me.

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:05.796
l brought you those headache pills
that you asked for.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:08.006
Good.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:13.220
ls there anything else?

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:15.931
No. No, that's all.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.061
Then go.

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:23.438
We are busy here.

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:02.144
Uh-huh.

01:39:09.527 --> 01:39:11.862
Morning.

01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:21.079
Come on.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:23.790
- Shit.
- Hello? Yes.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.917
Come on.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:28.337
Yes, sir.

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:34.968
Nicholas, there you are!
Were you trying to run away from me?

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:37.679
- No.
- Huh?

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:45.312
l need you at the airport right away
to help me with the hostages.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.147
- Ho... hostages?
- Yes.

01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:51.943
An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked
by our Palestinian brothers.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:54.279
They have landed here at Entebbe.

01:39:55.365 --> 01:39:58.784
The eyes of the world are on Uganda today.

01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:01.953
Come, Nicholas. To work.

01:40:18.805 --> 01:40:21.390
How many passengers?

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.934
250?

01:40:24.686 --> 01:40:26.853
How many of them are Zionist?

01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:33.485
And, uh, television -
plenty of television cameras.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:44.079
Please, tell them to take the hostages
to the terminal building.

01:41:00.805 --> 01:41:03.932
Mr President, the press is waiting for you, sir.

01:41:17.029 --> 01:41:22.492
l wanted to assure you that the hostages
will get the best medical care.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.287
l have made my own doctor available.

01:41:42.972 --> 01:41:45.390
Doctor. Doctor, what's the situation here?

01:41:45.558 --> 01:41:49.603
One woman with a heart condition
has gone to hospital, cases of shock,

01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:52.105
and we're giving malaria pills to everyone.

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:54.775
- Who's not been seen by a doctor?
- We haven't.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:58.570
OK, how many of you are there?

01:41:59.071 --> 01:42:03.658
- Yourself? You've not been seen yet?
- Malaria pills. How is everybody?

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.952
Thank you very much.

01:42:07.997 --> 01:42:10.957
OK. OK, anybody else?

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:19.049
OK. Take these three. The nurse
is gonna come round with water. Nurse.

01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:22.135
Thomas.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:26.681
Thomas, can you take these, please?
l'll be two minutes.

01:42:48.454 --> 01:42:50.455
No! Don't!

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.085
Spit.

01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:54.811
Look at you.

01:43:56.814 --> 01:44:01.401
ls there one thing
you have done that is good?

01:44:04.113 --> 01:44:07.490
Did you think this was all a game?

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:10.076
"l will go to Africa

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:12.829
and I will play the white man

01:44:12.997 --> 01:44:15.123
with the natives."

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:19.461
ls that what you thought?

01:44:20.046 --> 01:44:22.714
We are not a game, Nicholas.

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:27.177
We are real.

01:44:28.179 --> 01:44:30.347
This room here,

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:34.017
it is real.

01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:37.395
l think your death

01:44:37.563 --> 01:44:42.108
will be the first real thing
that has happened to you.

01:44:44.487 --> 01:44:46.696
Listen to me, Nicholas.

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:49.282
Listen. I know.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:51.368
Yes.

01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:54.621
l know about you...

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.581
and Kay.

01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:02.462
How could you do that to me?

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:08.802
l am the father of this nation, Nicholas,

01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:14.557
and you have
most grossly offended your father.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.731
You're a child.

01:45:23.693 --> 01:45:27.070
That's what makes you so fucking scary.

01:45:47.049 --> 01:45:49.134
ln my village,

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:56.224
when you steal the wife of an elder,

01:45:57.643 --> 01:46:00.103
they take you to a tree

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.772
and they hang you by your skin.

01:46:03.816 --> 01:46:07.027
Each time you scream,

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:11.031
the evil comes out of you.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.453
Sometimes it can take three days

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.749
for your evil to be spent.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:27.839
Pull him up.

01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:40.221
Good evening.

01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:42.640
l have good news.

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:48.771
The lsraeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

01:48:48.939 --> 01:48:52.859
So, as a gesture of good faith,

01:48:53.027 --> 01:48:57.572
all non-lsraeli hostages will be released.

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:05.622
l have arranged personally
an aeroplane to come and collect you.

01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:10.585
Yes.

01:49:27.228 --> 01:49:30.146
He'll be here when we come back.

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:35.860
This way, lsraelis!

01:49:52.044 --> 01:49:54.254
lsraelis, here!

01:50:22.783 --> 01:50:27.078
They have sent a plane.
They are releasing some of the hostages.

01:50:27.246 --> 01:50:31.207
lf you go now,
you will reach them before they leave.

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:33.584
Here, put this on.

01:50:34.628 --> 01:50:37.171
Why... why are you doing this?

01:50:38.215 --> 01:50:40.633
Frankly,

01:50:40.801 --> 01:50:43.386
l don't know.

01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:47.640
You deserve to die,

01:50:47.808 --> 01:50:50.393
but dead, you can do nothing.

01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:55.106
Alive, you might just be able
to redeem yourself.

01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:58.443
l don't understand.

01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:03.740
l am tired of hatred, Dr Garrigan.

01:51:04.783 --> 01:51:07.827
This country is drowning in it.

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:10.079
We deserve better.

01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:15.251
Go home.
Tell the world the truth about Amin.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:19.172
They will believe you.

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:22.133
You are a white man.

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:48.951
- What about you?
- My fate is in God's hands.

01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:51.579
Go. Now, before they come back.

01:51:52.623 --> 01:51:55.416
- Thank you.
- Go.

01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:57.502
Go!

01:53:30.429 --> 01:53:33.097
Thomas.

01:53:33.265 --> 01:53:34.849
Stop!

01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:38.936
Where is the doctor?

01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.649
l don't know.

01:53:47.446 --> 01:53:49.113
Destination Paris.

01:54:05.506 --> 01:54:08.257
My wife.

01:54:18.227 --> 01:54:21.687
There are many people
who have brokered relations with lsrael.

01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:28.069
They are not only Muslims,
they are also Christians. This particular...
