WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:43.080 --> 01:44.080
Carolina.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.280
Do you need something, sir?

01:48.360 --> 01:49.640
I don't, but you do.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.800
-Come on. I'll give you a ride to Glória.
-There's no need.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.920
Why would you want to walk there?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.720
I don't mind.
I like walking. I'm used to it.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.880
You definitely have the legs for it,
but still…

02:01.640 --> 02:04.600
Don't worry. I have to go
to Isaura's house, just down the road.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.640
-Are you going to Glória too?
-Yes.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.120
I'll keep you company.
I feel like walking for a bit as well.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.720
Fine.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.960
I won't insist. Enjoy your walk.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.600
AVANTE!
MARXISM AND LIBERTY

03:43.720 --> 03:45.440
Thank you for keeping me company.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.040
I don't really like riding in cars.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.000
What about your fiancé? Any news?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.760
Not yet.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I should have fled with him.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.920
Where to?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.040
France.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.320
Fernando was ready to go.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.600
He knows people there
who come from Ribatejo.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.200
During wartime, a deserter
can face up to 20 years in prison.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.040
That's still better than dying.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.040
I don't know.
People who come back just aren't the same.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.840
The other day
you asked me what it was like.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.120
The war.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.480
Nights are the worst.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
We try to forget what we've seen
and what we've had to do.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.720
I've never told anyone this,

04:37.520 --> 04:40.040
but sometimes
I start looking at other people.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.280
My parents,

04:43.240 --> 04:44.520
Fernando,

04:45.560 --> 04:47.120
and I don't feel anything.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.840
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

04:52.480 --> 04:53.920
We are all on our own.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.160
Do you feel that way too?

04:58.520 --> 04:59.440
I do.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.400
Good to know
there's nothing wrong with me.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.560
I didn't say that.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.640
-Have you ever left Ribatejo?
-No.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.200
I would love to see the ocean.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.760
I hear it's salty.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.200
Hey.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.400
You're late.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.480
Your watch must be running fast.
Go on now.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.240
-How was everything?
-Yeah, good.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.280
Have a good day today.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.680
COFFEE

07:44.000 --> 07:45.400
Just do the usual maintenance.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.200
Lubrication, checking the straps,
aligning the caps.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.600
Hopefully,
that'll be enough to fix the issue.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.240
And what if it's not that simple?

07:58.960 --> 08:02.240
Figure it out! And don't come back
until the issue has been fixed.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.120
Gonçalo?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
Aren't you coming with us, sir?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.240
No, there's too much to do here.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.360
But I'm sure
you two will take care of this in no time.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.000
Okay, then.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.400
You'll leave for Lisbon today,
and I want the issue fixed ASAP.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.600
A couple days in Lisbon sounds good.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.360
You're going for work.
I don't want any partying.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.640
-Hey. Where are you going?
-To the bathroom. I'll be right back.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.920
The Benfica cyclist

09:46.000 --> 09:50.840
Américo Silva is the winner of the 31st--

09:54.920 --> 09:56.440
Américo won.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.800
You lied to me about Mia.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.320
I saw pictures of the two of you.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.840
Were you two involved?

10:15.840 --> 10:17.640
My private life's not your business.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.560
Since when have you been using?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.240
No? When we get to Lisbon,
I can call the director.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.360
If he orders them to search your room,
I'm sure they'll find something.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.240
You went through my stuff?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.880
Why were you in my room,
going through my stuff?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.120
What's going on?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.520
Why do you want to know where Mia is?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.240
We were friends.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.080
Mia helped me. She helped me a lot, João.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.640
She referred me to a doctor
at Santa Maria Hospital.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.520
That was just a stupid phase.
I haven't touched the stuff in months.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
Who scored you the morphine?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.920
-Was it Miguel?
-No.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.760
No, it was an American.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.040
A soldier who served in Vietnam.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.880
-Does he still work at RARET?
-No, they fired him.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.560
They found him on the bathroom floor.
That was when I decided to stop.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.560
João, please. Don't tell anyone.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.320
Was Mia on that stuff too?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.400
You know she wasn't.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.760
And you didn't do anything
when she disappeared? Didn't find it odd?

12:07.680 --> 12:08.960
Mia said goodbye.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.480
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
but she was seeing someone.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.800
And she said she was happy.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
Who was it?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.960
She never told me.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.800
But it had to be serious

12:23.960 --> 12:26.680
for her to decide
to drop everything and leave.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.640
Just say the safe word,
and this will all be over.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.080
Enough.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.680
We've been at it for 24 hours.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.640
He won't talk.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.360
Fine.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.120
What was the safe word?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.200
I'm not telling you.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.040
Empathy is another great strategy
to make someone talk.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.960
Let's get going.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.240
I can't find anything here.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.080
No, but this should help. Hang on.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.480
-Try it now.
-Let me check if the current is flowing.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.320
-Is it flowing?
-Yes.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.040
We've taken it all apart
and still nothing.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.360
Bravo, Alexandre.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.200
João, won't you play something?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.480
After Alexandre? No way.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.880
I don't know if you know this,
but João is very gifted with the piano.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.880
When he left for university,
he stopped playing every day.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.440
Go on, then. I've never seen you play.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.600
Shall we play something together?

16:34.680 --> 16:37.880
-I haven't played in a long time.
-He used to play with his girlfriend.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.600
Mom, please.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.360
Come on, play something.
I'll go check on dinner.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.160
Okay, then.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.360
Brahms's Waltz?

17:04.200 --> 17:07.000
There is a PIDE informant inside RARET.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.880
You have to find out who it is.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.920
I tried to call Ursula.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.080
You won't have to worry about her again.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.520
We had to do
what was necessary to protect you.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.560
Should we start over?

17:38.760 --> 17:40.800
-I don't think so.
-Come on, João.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.400
We don't want to disappoint our audience.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.680
Our audience is too kind
to point out our mistakes.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.400
I don't want to subject them to more.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.120
Try this, and tell me
whether the wine is any good this year.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.600
As long as you don't add water
to get more out of it.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.240
I never do that.
That ruins both the wine and the water.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.920
What about your wife?
Did she make it to Lisbon?

18:17.720 --> 18:18.920
You mean Sofia?

18:20.480 --> 18:21.600
When?

18:22.640 --> 18:24.240
Maybe I'm mistaken.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.440
Maybe it wasn't her.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.200
Would you like to play some cards?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.800
Thank you.
Maybe next time. Enjoy your game.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.120
-May I?
-Go ahead.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.520
They're American. Would you like one?

18:47.600 --> 18:48.720
No, thank you.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.840
Luís…

18:58.600 --> 19:00.520
I need to speak to you.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.520
It's about your daughter.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.320
She's been behaving differently
since her fiancé left.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.040
That's understandable.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.560
It would be normal for her to be sad.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.960
But she isn't.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.280
RARET is not the right place
for a girl like her.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.440
Things got weird after I got better.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.160
You have no idea.
I can't even walk close to the dam.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.360
It reminds me
of the days I spent in that house.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.280
What house?

19:40.840 --> 19:43.000
Mia had a house close to the Magos Dam.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.720
I stayed there while I was getting clean.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.400
You didn't know she had a house there?

19:49.880 --> 19:50.800
Excuse me.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.400
Bill has seen Taborda fight.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.920
He says that not many are as good as him.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.400
His only problem
is that he was born in Portugal.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.120
-Don't turn your back on me!
-I'm already late, Dad.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.600
-He said you're not going back.
-I won't stop working.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.960
No, you won't.
You'll help us in the fields.

20:15.040 --> 20:15.960
You're engaged now.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.720
-You need to behave properly!
-I've always behaved properly.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.480
Not another word!

20:29.040 --> 20:30.280
I'm not working the fields.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.360
Yes, you are.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.080
Your father doesn't like being challenged.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.720
-Want me to do it?
-No worries.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.480
Done.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.120
It sounds like a Mass.
Are they trying to convert the communists?

21:03.280 --> 21:04.880
That would take a miracle.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.880
My dad asked me
to drop by the ministry. Want to come?

21:13.960 --> 21:16.080
To the ministry? I sure do.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.960
J.V. STALIN

21:28.480 --> 21:29.680
What's this?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.160
I don't know.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.520
I have no idea.
It's not mine or my wife's.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.440
Don't take us for fools.
These were in your house.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.920
I've never seen those before.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.440
Where is she?

21:40.520 --> 21:41.760
I have no idea.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.360
Someone must have planted
those books here.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.360
Fucking Commie.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.640
-You can't do this.
-You better start talking.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.920
Sir?

21:56.320 --> 21:59.560
What? I've never seen that before.
This makes absolutely no sense.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.080
Where is your wife?

22:05.800 --> 22:06.680
I don't know.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.200
Get him.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.920
You'll talk, eventually.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.400
-Good morning. Come with me, please.
-Thank you.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.160
Come in.

22:39.080 --> 22:39.960
Excuse me.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.400
I hope
I'm not interrupting anything important.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.360
Here, everything is important.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.960
Thank you.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.520
-João.
-How are you?

22:53.600 --> 22:54.960
-Gonçalo.
-I am well.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.960
Any news on our colleague, the translator?

22:58.480 --> 23:00.960
We got confirmation that she was a mole.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.120
Her husband was sent to Caxias,
and she got away.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.360
Well, the minister wants to meet you.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.040
Now we need to find out
if there are any more moles at RARET.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.680
This is a very unusual situation.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.160
Everyone's investigated
before being brought to RARET.

23:19.240 --> 23:23.160
You know it's always tricky
to investigate a foreigner's past.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.000
Would you mind
waiting here a minute, Gonçalo?

23:27.080 --> 23:29.840
-No, not at all. Take your time.
-Come.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.600
If it were up to the Americans,
all radio shows would be produced here.

23:42.680 --> 23:46.640
We only authorize retransmission
because we want to remain neutral.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.920
And that's what happens. I can assure you.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.160
Right now, we have a common enemy,

23:53.240 --> 23:55.720
but we are not
on the same page as the Americans.

23:55.800 --> 24:00.400
Our clashes at the UN
over the colonies are proof of that.

24:02.240 --> 24:06.840
João, you were stationed
in Angola, is that right?

24:06.920 --> 24:08.080
Cabinda.

24:08.840 --> 24:09.920
Cabinda.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.560
I hear it was a complicated area.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.400
This war won't be over
until communism is taken down.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.760
And the darkies stop receiving weapons
from the Soviets and the Cubans.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.480
Since I came back, I've been hearing
the Soviet Union's days are numbered.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.320
They are. The question is how many.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.800
And we have to…

24:32.840 --> 24:35.480
we have to control the Americans.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.720
My name won't go down in history

24:39.320 --> 24:42.440
as the minister who handed over
a territory we've had for 500 years.

24:42.520 --> 24:47.240
The humiliation of losing Goa
to the Indian army in 1961 was enough.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.760
As you may have noticed,

24:48.840 --> 24:52.080
there are no friends
in diplomacy, only allies.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.080
That's why we want to ask you

24:57.520 --> 25:00.280
to be our eyes and ears at RARET.

25:00.360 --> 25:04.600
We need to know exactly
what the Americans' agenda is.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.280
Me?

25:09.160 --> 25:11.080
We already have a secret agent inside,

25:11.160 --> 25:15.200
but we believe that you,
as one of our nation's most devout sons,

25:15.840 --> 25:18.200
could play an important role.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.560
No one else can know.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.480
You report directly to me or your father.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.680
Can we count on your patriotism?

25:33.400 --> 25:35.560
It would be an honor, sir.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.680
But I need to know
who the other agent inside RARET is.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.840
Henrique.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.880
It wasn't because I didn't trust you.
It really wasn't.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.280
I just couldn't tell you.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.000
I understand.
You were just doing your job.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.200
-What info have you been giving them?
-Nothing big.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.640
I tell them about the dissidents
who come through RARET

26:29.720 --> 26:31.560
and the routines of the Americans.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.600
But I don't have
much access to their homes.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.000
But you, given who your father is,
will be invited to every party.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.080
I'm going to bed.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.680
Somebody told me
they saw you at the bus stop.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.680
There's not much to do here.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.840
It was full of families
saying goodbye to the soldiers.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.040
What would you do if you were on your own?

27:15.480 --> 27:18.160
I'm going to bed. I have a headache.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.920
So, feeling a little calmer?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.800
You didn't have to kill her.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.840
Believe me, we had no choice.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.480
I don't think it's safe
for us to meet here.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.440
Don't worry. Zé Mudo belongs to the party.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.720
Several of our comrades
who went underground

28:35.800 --> 28:37.400
have spent a few nights here.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.640
Forget about Ursula.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.600
She gave us your name
as soon as we started grilling her.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.160
The minister asked me
to be an informant for PIDE.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.600
And did they tell you
who the mole is inside RARET?

28:56.880 --> 28:58.760
Mia suspected there was someone.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.080
No, I have no idea.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.240
Try to find out.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.800
And did you find out anything
about Mia's disappearance?

29:10.800 --> 29:13.240
She rented a house close to the Magos Dam.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.200
We'll keep that house under surveillance.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.960
-Irina works at--
-Ilsa.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.920
Ilsa Becker.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.440
That's right.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.760
Ilsa works at the inn.
She'll be your main handler.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.200
I'll stop by.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.840
I don't trust him.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.560
And I don't trust anyone.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.280
Keep your eyes open.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.160
DEAR FERNANDO,
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL. THINGS ARE GOOD HERE.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.160
"Things are good here."

30:08.240 --> 30:13.280
Carolina has already tried on
her outfit for the wedding.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.640
We miss you,

30:24.120 --> 30:27.320
but I have faith,
and I pray to Mary every day

30:28.680 --> 30:30.680
for you to return in good health.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.880
Take care of yourself.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.960
Your loving parents.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.360
Ambush!

30:43.200 --> 30:47.720
We got off the road, next to a village,
and suddenly the road was blocked.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.680
Shots were coming from everywhere.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.000
We only had time to hit the ground.
We fired at anything that moved.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.880
-Doctor!
-Come on! Come on, quickly!

30:54.960 --> 30:57.360
Fernando, help me!

30:57.440 --> 31:00.600
Fernando, get a fucking move on!
Now, Fernando! Help me!

31:01.680 --> 31:03.560
-Come on, quickly!
-Pick him up.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.840
Hurry the fuck up, Fernando!

31:09.960 --> 31:12.000
Come forward!

31:17.000 --> 31:17.960
Move, Fernando.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.720
Don't you dare cry.
If they see you, you're fucked.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.400
I can't handle this place, Mário!

31:22.480 --> 31:24.360
No one wants to be here. Come on.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.920
You still have two more years left,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.920
so you better get used to it,
or you'll go crazy.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.880
We're here to do what we're told.
The less you think about it, the better.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.600
It's you.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.920
Most men are happy to see me.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.480
There's someone living in the house.
They ran away when I arrived.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.640
Was it Mia?

36:17.880 --> 36:18.960
I couldn't tell.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.360
If it was her and she ran away,
she's scared of being found.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.240
I wonder if she's scared
of being caught by PIDE or by us.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.120
João, the translator
would have compromised you.

36:31.920 --> 36:35.160
And if Mia is a deserter,
she can also compromise all of us.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.360
Ursula didn't have to die.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.480
You know how this works.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.080
I have to get back to RARET.
We don't want people to be suspicious.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.960
You should rest. Lie down for a while.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.840
I'll stand guard.
