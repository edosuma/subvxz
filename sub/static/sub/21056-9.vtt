WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.404
- A Pop original series.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.641
[energetic brass music]

00:07.675 --> 00:09.377
- I liked you neck scarf.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.578
- Well, thank you.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.546
It's my own creation.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.449
I combined my son's baby blanket
and my wife's sheer nylon

00:15.483 --> 00:17.318
panty hose,
pretty proud of it.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.620
*

00:19.653 --> 00:21.389
- Well, we're gonna have
a great show tonight.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.557
Why?
Because we have Paul Rudd.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.126
Funniest man in America.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.428
We have Wendy Williams.
Yes, queen.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.731
- Uh, Staci, I have something
more important to discuss

00:30.764 --> 00:32.266
than who's on tonight's show.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.102
- The suspense is killing me.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.836
I prepared
a PowerPoint presentation.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.271
- Oh, Jesus.

00:37.305 --> 00:40.241
- "The Great Biopics
Of Our Time,"

00:40.274 --> 00:42.376
"Malcolm X."
"Ray."

00:42.410 --> 00:44.612
"The Last King of Scotland."

00:44.645 --> 00:46.180
"Mary Poppins."

00:46.214 --> 00:48.382
I got a great opportunity
for you guys.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.784
Jimmy,
our host and Capitan,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.487
is making a biopic
about himself.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.356
- What a fucking narcissist.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.691
- Okay, Todd, what is this?
- Well, to pay for the movie,

00:57.725 --> 00:59.860
Jimmy set up
a crowdfunding page

00:59.893 --> 01:03.164
and he is offering the staff
a chance to...

01:03.197 --> 01:05.333
contribute some money.
- What?

01:05.366 --> 01:07.401
According to Doreen
in accounting,

01:07.435 --> 01:09.470
Jimmy makes $6 million
a year,

01:09.503 --> 01:12.740
so where does he get off
asking us to donate money?

01:12.773 --> 01:16.244
- Oh, not donate.
Its, um, "invest."

01:16.277 --> 01:18.879
- Can't he just ask for money
from other rich people?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.282
- No.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.450
He cannot.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.153
This is an indie movie.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.655
It's an unauthorized version.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.390
He already sold
the authorized version

01:29.423 --> 01:32.360
for butt tons of money.
I mean, it was great.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.894
Hey, I'm asking you.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.497
Jimmy,
our boss and savior,

01:36.530 --> 01:38.199
is asking you...

01:38.232 --> 01:40.568
to please dig deep.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.636
Okay?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.238
Contribute what you can.

01:44.272 --> 01:47.775
Donate whatever's in
your wallets. All right?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.544
And support the arts.
Thank you.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.181
- Well, as long as
its not a reexamination

01:53.214 --> 01:54.515
of the "Peter Pan" tale

01:54.548 --> 01:57.351
or another Holocaust movie,
I'm in.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.752
- Pretty sure
there's a Nazi in it.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.255
- I'm still in.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.224
- Where's your money?

02:03.257 --> 02:06.894
male announcer: From studio 9-B
in the heart of New York City,

02:06.927 --> 02:09.730
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

02:09.763 --> 02:12.500
Tonight, who says leading men
can't be funny?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.935
Paul Rudd is here.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.207
How you doin'?
Wendy Williams.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.543
A visit from
the masturbating polar bear.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.479
And now, the man who's
number five in the ratings

02:25.513 --> 02:27.481
but number one in our hearts.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.151
Here's Jimmy.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.289
- All right,
make yourselves at home.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.557
- Thank you.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.259
- What's in all
of these things?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.261
- My wigs.
- Oh.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.263
- Hi, Wendy.
Welcome to "Nightcap."

02:42.296 --> 02:43.797
I'm Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.966
Your hands are really
cold and clammy.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.835
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.704
- Man, I haven't seen this many
wigs since high school.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.807
I worked in a dump right outside
of a drag queen bar.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.711
- I love wigs
and, Wendy, you have so many.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.613
What are you gonna wear
on the show tonight?

02:59.647 --> 03:00.948
- I don't know which one
I'm gonna choose

03:00.981 --> 03:02.583
for the show tonight.
You know how that is.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.952
- I know, girl.
- Oh, girl!

03:06.720 --> 03:09.390
- Okay, well,
I'm gonna leave you to relax

03:09.423 --> 03:11.659
with your ladies
and I'll be back.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.261
- Thank you.
Bye, Penny.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.896
Thank you, Phil.
- Oh.

03:18.699 --> 03:22.236
- Oh.
- [scoffs]

03:22.270 --> 03:23.437
I've never.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.905
- I didn't want a tip,

03:24.938 --> 03:26.874
I just wanted a low-five.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.377
But it'd be tacky
to give it back now,

03:29.410 --> 03:32.780
so I'm just gonna take it
and get myself a cup of coffee.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.415
- You guys gotta get involved.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.617
This movie's gonna be epic
with a capital--

03:36.650 --> 03:38.486
- E.
- E!

03:38.519 --> 03:39.920
- Well, I have no doubt
this movie will be

03:39.953 --> 03:42.790
unwatchably bad,
but I'm going to invest,

03:42.823 --> 03:45.593
because every awful product
Jimmy has ever put his name on

03:45.626 --> 03:47.361
has made a ton of money.
- Yeah.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.929
Those hemp-powered batteries.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.465
- The glow-in-the-dark soda.
- Exactly.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.000
So though I do not
respect Jimmy,

03:53.033 --> 03:55.603
I respect his ability to
con money out of idiots

03:55.636 --> 03:56.637
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.771
- All right.
- Great.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.006
- So we're in as investors.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.941
We're an investing duo.
- Yeah.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.811
- All right.
How much can I put you down for?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.646
- Uh...
- Oh, money.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.281
- How much money do you have?
[indistinct whispers]

04:07.315 --> 04:08.916
- What, you gonna kiss?
- We're not kissing,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.552
we're having a business meeting.
[indistinct whispers]

04:11.585 --> 04:13.487
- We have 2,500...
- Yeah.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.823
- And we will be paying
in Bitcoin.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.825
- Whoa!
Thank you, guys.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.693
- Absolutely.
- All right, I'll mark it down.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.696
- Oh, here's a gathering
I want no part of.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.698
- Okay, well, I think we were
just about done here anyway.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.600
So, sir.
- Sir.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.436
- Todd.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.439
- Oh, Staci,
I got something really fun

04:31.472 --> 04:32.973
for you to do.
- Oh, yeah? What?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.708
- On tonight's show,
Jimmy wants you to get

04:34.742 --> 04:37.010
Paul Rudd to promote
the crowdsourcing page.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.012
Right? For Jimmy's movie.
- Mm-hmm.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.814
How's that fun for me?
- Well, you get to tell

04:40.848 --> 04:42.950
Paul Rudd that he's gonna play
Jimmy in the movie.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.585
- Okay, first of all,
it's ridiculous

04:44.618 --> 04:46.654
that Paul Rudd is gonna play
Jimmy in a movie

04:46.687 --> 04:48.021
in the first place.
- I know. I know.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.723
Jimmy was gonna play himself,
but he was like,

04:49.757 --> 04:52.460
"That's super narcissistic."
I happen to agree.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.562
- I totally agree.
- Yeah, so, that's why

04:54.595 --> 04:55.896
we gotta get Paul Rudd
to do it.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.898
- I am not gonna harass
Paul Rudd.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.401
- Oh, definitely don't
harass him; he won't do it.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.769
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.437
that just seems
counterintuitive.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.972
- This isn't my job.
- What isn't?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.907
- Getting Paul Rudd
to play Jimmy in a movie.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.342
- Yeah, it is.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.411
You're Staci from talent.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.879
- Okay, Todd,
I-I--

05:11.912 --> 05:13.647
first of all,
I'm not gonna leave this room

05:13.681 --> 05:15.649
because I know you're gonna
pee in the sink again.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.785
- I wa--
Yeah, I was.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.753
How do you know that?
- I--because you always get

05:19.787 --> 05:22.456
a little drool
when you gotta pee.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.024
[jazzy music]

05:24.057 --> 05:25.659
So excited to have you here.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.860
- Excited to be here.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.397
- So, basically,
uh, I just need you

05:29.430 --> 05:31.832
to go out there,
say hi to Jimmy,

05:31.865 --> 05:33.734
do your fun,
little frat thing,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
and then, uh...
- Right.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.770
- He's gonna ask you
about the biopic.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.539
- What?
He's making a biopic?

05:38.572 --> 05:41.041
- About himself
growing up in Long Island--

05:41.074 --> 05:43.076
a stand-up becoming
a late-night talk show.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.779
And you are perfect
to play Jimmy.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.882
- [sighs]
That's very flattering.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.151
I--not only
would I not...

05:51.184 --> 05:52.953
want to star in that movie,

05:52.986 --> 05:54.488
I wouldn't want to
see that movie.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
That's a--
it's boring.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.592
- But he's--
he is gonna mention it

05:58.626 --> 05:59.827
first thing
when you come out.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.562
So, I--
- [groans] Why--

06:01.595 --> 06:04.665
Look, the only reason
any of us even do these shows

06:04.698 --> 06:07.067
is so that we can
sell our own boring shit.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.170
Why would we use this segment
to go out there

06:10.203 --> 06:12.005
and sell his boring shit?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.574
- Well, we'll start there

06:13.607 --> 06:15.443
and then we'll talk
about your boring shit.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.478
- Can't we just talk about
my boring shit?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.779
- Oh, I think
he wants both.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.581
His boring shit
and your boring shit.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.715
- That's a lot
of boring shit.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.684
- Yeah, well...
- I'll tell you

06:23.717 --> 06:25.919
the most interesting thing to me
about Jimmy is the--

06:25.953 --> 06:28.088
was the fact that he was
a Scientologist

06:28.121 --> 06:29.623
and then...left.
- Yeah.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.492
- Yeah, he doesn't want
to talk about that.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.060
It's really about
a stand-up who became

06:33.093 --> 06:34.862
a talk show host.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.196
- What's interesting
about that?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.698
- Well, not everybody

06:37.731 --> 06:39.633
got to be a stand-up
and then a talk show host.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.602
- Four people were stand-ups

06:41.635 --> 06:42.936
and then got to be
talk show hosts

06:42.970 --> 06:44.672
and all four of them
have shows right now.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.675
- But four out of
millions is, you know,

06:47.708 --> 06:50.010
I think people in China
will find it fascinating.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.480
- People in China
don't even know who Jimmy is.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.115
- Not yet. That's why the biopic
is so important.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.519
- Why is he even asking people
to crowdfund his movie?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.187
I mean, do you want me to give
money to the--to the--

07:00.220 --> 07:01.655
- Well, that would be great.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.223
- That is not cool.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.993
- It's not?
- No.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.061
- What do you consider
"cool"?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.630
- Not doing this movie.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.104
[energetic brass music]

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
- Miss Williams?
- She stepped out.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.741
Can I help you?
- Oh, okay.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.643
I just have her segment notes.
- Just leave 'em over there.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.545
Daniel Craig is at Nobu
and I need to sign

07:24.578 --> 07:26.647
his hot, English ass.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.931
- Oh, my...

07:43.964 --> 07:45.699
- It's real human hair.
- [gasps] Oh, my God!

07:45.733 --> 07:49.269
I'm so sorry!
I'm so, so terribly embarrassed.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.639
So unprofessional.
I-I just couldn't help myself.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.707
They're so beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.844
You know, it's not nice
to try on other people's wigs.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.279
It's, uh, germy,
number one,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.781
and number two,
it's just--

08:00.814 --> 08:02.683
they're too personal.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.217
- You know, I've heard that.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.586
Uh, I'm not from the street.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.920
- Well, neither am I!

08:06.954 --> 08:08.689
- [stammers]
Right.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.291
- How did you get involved
with loving wigs, anyway?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.961
- Oh, well,
I had severe cradle cap

08:13.994 --> 08:16.997
and my hair didn't grow in
until well into my teens.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.066
So I had
to make my own wigs,

08:19.099 --> 08:20.634
but, you know what,
it was no big deal.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.070
I was actually a breech birth,
so I was grateful

08:23.103 --> 08:25.539
just to be alive
to have cradle cap.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.642
- This is a cute wig,
but this is not

08:28.676 --> 08:30.310
the man magnet.
- Really?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.179
- No.
Try this one.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.147
- Oh, she's beautiful.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.550
- See, you're already into it
'cause you call it a "she."

08:36.584 --> 08:37.618
That's what I call my wigs.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.919
- You do?
- Yes, "she."

08:38.952 --> 08:40.821
This is not a bad color on you.
- [gasps]

08:40.854 --> 08:42.089
- You could really
pull this off.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.957
- Oh, my God.
- Your eyes are green,

08:43.991 --> 08:45.626
you know,
you've got nice skin,

08:45.659 --> 08:48.028
and I love the subtle wave.
- Um...

08:48.061 --> 08:50.030
you are the nicest guest
that we've ever

08:50.063 --> 08:52.800
had on the show
and, not for nothing,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.134
but we've had
Jeff Goldblum.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.769
- [chuckles]
Thank you.

08:55.803 --> 08:56.770
You're catching me
on a good day.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.005
- Thank you so much.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.040
- So this is what
I'm going to do.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.576
I want to give you this wig...
- [gasps]

09:02.610 --> 09:04.578
- Because your germs
are already in it.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.279
- Sorry.
- And I'm going to give you

09:06.313 --> 09:09.249
this wig.
Do you feel beautiful?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.585
- I haven't felt
this beautiful

09:11.619 --> 09:13.987
since my mom told me
I wasn't beautiful.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.757
- Fuck her! She's the one
who gave you cradle cap!

09:16.790 --> 09:18.191
- Thank you, Wendy.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.192
- You're very welcome.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.228
[energetic brass music]

09:21.261 --> 09:22.596
- Hey.
- Can I sit down?

09:22.630 --> 09:25.699
- Nope.
- [groans]

09:25.733 --> 09:27.367
So did you get Paul Rudd
to do Jimmy's movie?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.802
- No, he doesn't
want to do it.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.904
- What? What are you talking
ab--

09:30.938 --> 09:32.305
Oh, my God.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.074
My investors
are gonna be pissed.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.777
- What investors?
- Everyone.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.013
Red-headed Randy,
uh, the round chef.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.148
Everyone.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.183
Okay, why isn't Paul doing it?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.152
- Okay, um, Todd,
I'm gonna tell you,

09:45.185 --> 09:48.355
but listen to me, to the grave.
- Yeah.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.624
- Paul Rudd doesn't think
Jimmy's interesting.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.359
- What?

09:52.392 --> 09:55.262
Jimmy is the most interesting
guy I know.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.197
And what are you talking about?
He shoots hoops!

09:57.230 --> 10:00.067
He watches movies!
He swims!

10:00.100 --> 10:01.835
- Don't get so heated
about this.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.403
- I have to!
I--well, you're telling me--

10:03.436 --> 10:05.706
he's more interesting
than Captain Hook!

10:05.739 --> 10:07.808
- What does Captain Hook
have to do with any of this?

10:07.841 --> 10:10.778
- He's an old man
in a world of boys.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.746
All right?
And he's got a hook for a hand!

10:12.780 --> 10:14.982
And he wears that regalia
like a champ!

10:15.015 --> 10:17.050
Oh, my God!
He's so interesting!

10:17.084 --> 10:18.686
- Regalia?
- Yes!

10:18.719 --> 10:20.153
He's dressed in the nines

10:20.187 --> 10:22.022
and he,
[mumbles with pirate accent]

10:22.055 --> 10:23.724
and everyone's like,
"Who the fuck are you?"

10:23.757 --> 10:25.759
And he's like,
"I'm Captain Hook."

10:25.793 --> 10:28.729
He's Peter Pan's nemesis
and Peter Pan's interesting!

10:28.762 --> 10:30.430
If I was stranded on
a desert island and I could

10:30.463 --> 10:32.733
only take three people
with me, I'd take Jimmy

10:32.766 --> 10:35.268
and no one else
'cause Jimmy's that interesting.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.037
- What about Captain Hook?

10:37.070 --> 10:40.007
- Yeah, fine, Captain Hook and
Smee.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.375
- Who's Smee?
- Captain Hook's lover.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.945
- I--
- Fuck Paul Rudd!

10:44.978 --> 10:47.080
[energetic brass music]

10:47.114 --> 10:48.949
- Wendy Williams.
- Staci.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.051
- We are so excited
to have you back on the show.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.286
- Thank you for inviting me.
- Hi, I'm Staci Cole.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.723
- Hi.
- Oh...

10:55.756 --> 10:59.292
Penny, you shouldn't be playing
with the guest star's hair.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.094
- Well, I'm actually
giving her this

11:01.128 --> 11:03.063
and it's really
boosted her confidence.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.165
- Well.
- Staci, I can't believe

11:05.198 --> 11:06.466
you've been working here
for so long

11:06.499 --> 11:07.735
and you're not
running this place.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.902
- Oh, you know,

11:08.936 --> 11:11.004
the politics around here
are crazy.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.272
I didn't fuck Jimmy.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.307
- Well, you know,
my show's been renewed

11:14.341 --> 11:17.978
till 2043,
that's a lot of TV time

11:18.011 --> 11:19.880
and I know that you're
doing talent booking here,

11:19.913 --> 11:22.282
but there's so many things
that you're qualified for.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.918
- Oh, I love daytime.
I do.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.454
I love the makeovers
and "Who da father?" and stuff.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.089
- That's fun stuff.
- Yeah!

11:29.122 --> 11:30.991
- Can I say something?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.425
You would be lucky
to have Staci.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.828
Staci Cole would make
the most incredible

11:34.862 --> 11:36.897
executive producer
for daytime television.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.166
Look at her!
She's smart, she's funny,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.101
she's beautiful,
she's bold,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.470
she says what she means,
she means what she does,

11:43.503 --> 11:45.172
she does it all the time!

11:45.205 --> 11:46.940
She brings it
when she brings it.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.108
[growls]

11:48.141 --> 11:50.177
I feel so alive.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.445
I'm gonna go FaceTime
my mom.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.148
- Look at that, red hair has
changed her personality.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.750
- Oh, gosh.
Oh, if I go anywhere,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.819
she'll be carrying my bags.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.087
- The best thing
that you can do is just

12:00.120 --> 12:01.955
keep this between
me, you, and Penny,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.824
go over to the show
and interview.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.893
Don't tell anybody
around here.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.360
- Yes!

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
[high-pitched]
Yes!

12:09.029 --> 12:10.430
- You don't have to
act black,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.299
just 'cause you might work
at the black girl show.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.500
- Very well.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.873
[energetic brass music]

12:19.907 --> 12:23.010
- So, basically,
Jimmy didn't see your movie

12:23.043 --> 12:24.945
so if you could just
give me the questions

12:24.978 --> 12:26.847
and I can give 'em to Jimmy,
than he can ask you.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.849
- No, it's all right.
He doesn't need to ask me

12:28.882 --> 12:30.350
anything about it.
Just have him say

12:30.383 --> 12:31.418
that it's great
and that I'm great in it.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.419
- Okay.
[knock at door]

12:32.452 --> 12:33.486
- Hey!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.355
- Hey.
- It's Todd.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.024
- Hey, Todd,
what are you doing?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.126
- Paul Rudd wears makeup?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.328
- Oh, just--just--
just when I'm cruising.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.496
- [laughs]
- Tight tits, bro.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.132
Uh, you know what?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.000
This reminds me
of a really good Jimmy story.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.502
Uh, this one time
Jimmy and I were at Spumoni's

12:49.536 --> 12:51.839
out in Long Island,
and we were eating pizza

12:51.872 --> 12:53.540
and there was this
bird outside

12:53.573 --> 12:56.409
and then there was,
like, no more oregano left

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
and he was like,
"Yo, where's the oregano?"

12:58.345 --> 13:00.881
And then he asked the person
behind the counter,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.149
but they
didn't speak English

13:02.182 --> 13:04.217
and we just like...
that was it.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.319
- That's a great story.
- Hey.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.988
So many more stories about
Jimmy.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.256
That's just the tip of the
"Titanic."

13:09.289 --> 13:10.557
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.292
- That one is a good one,
though.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.526
- Right? It was a good one.
It was nice meeting you, man.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.962
I did my job.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.830
That guy's--
that guy's rad.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.166
- Rad is a nice word for it.
- Hey, Marcus,

13:19.199 --> 13:22.135
do you have any makeup
'cause I got a pimple.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.604
I think it was because
I ate a lot of chocolate

13:24.637 --> 13:26.039
this weekend.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.208
There was a big pile of it
and I just

13:28.241 --> 13:30.243
kept eating it
and kept eating it

13:30.277 --> 13:33.180
and kept eating it
and now there's a big pimple

13:33.213 --> 13:35.849
and its right behind my glasses
and it really hurts.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.318
Like, every time I push up--
ow.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.187
And then--
oh, ow.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.989
And th--ow.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.456
I have these glasses.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.860
I wanted to some other glasses
to cover it up,

13:46.894 --> 13:49.863
but then I put those glasses
on and it didn't cover it up

13:49.897 --> 13:52.966
so I put these glasses on
and they do cover it up,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.868
but the problem is
is that they hurt.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.970
- Okay.
- Hi.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.873
I'm Paul.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.209
What's your name?
- I'm Phil.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.211
- Phil.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.179
What do you do here,
Phil?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.650
- Well,
I'm the security guard here.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.386
- Oh, I didn't know
if you just liked to wear that.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.288
- But if you're asking,
like,

14:15.322 --> 14:18.291
how do I fit
into the whole world,

14:18.325 --> 14:21.895
well, I just live my life

14:21.929 --> 14:25.298
and I have my
very own apartment.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.901
I do share it
with a cat.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.403
I used to share it
with two cats,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.339
but it turned out
that the other one

14:32.372 --> 14:34.607
was a New York City rat.
- Ew.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.309
- It broke into my house
and it ate

14:36.343 --> 14:38.311
all of my peanut butter.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.213
- Yeah.
Well, it happens.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.581
- I really like peanut butter.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.550
I eat it a lot.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.386
Bye.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.621
- I'm so sorry.
- About what?

14:48.655 --> 14:52.459
- Well, he doesn't usually
come into makeup and...

14:52.492 --> 14:55.028
- He's amazing.
- Phil's amazing?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.930
- He's incredible.
- Huh.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.465
- Is he in the biopic?
- No.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.500
- Can he be?
- Yes!

15:00.533 --> 15:04.671
[sighs] It sounds self-serving,
or, um...

15:04.704 --> 15:07.374
but if you play a part
like that you can win an award.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.708
- Yes.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.378
- Like, you know, "Gilbert
Grape."

15:11.411 --> 15:14.514
- Oh, you wanna play
Phil in the biopic?

15:14.547 --> 15:16.016
- I would love to play Phil.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.051
I never get offered
those parts.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.287
- It seems like an easy fit
for you and--

15:20.320 --> 15:23.156
- If you let me
play that part...

15:23.190 --> 15:24.591
- Yeah?
- I will absolutely

15:24.624 --> 15:26.659
go on Jimmy's show
and plug his movie.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.495
- You'll go out on stage--

15:28.528 --> 15:30.230
- Give me the uniform
and a big 'ole pair of glasses

15:30.263 --> 15:32.499
and a zit on my forehead
and a rat

15:32.532 --> 15:34.001
that eats peanut butter.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.368
- Uh, you've got a deal.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.270
- It's a deal.
Done!

15:37.304 --> 15:38.305
All right.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.341
[energetic brass music]

15:41.374 --> 15:43.476
- Oh, Wendy Williams.
- Oh!

15:43.510 --> 15:44.978
- You were so great
on the show.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
I mean, you really
gave it to Jimmy.

15:46.479 --> 15:50.117
That was great TV.
- And you looked beautiful!

15:50.150 --> 15:51.451
- Of course she did.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.520
- Wendy,
you gave me a gift,

15:53.553 --> 15:56.156
now here's a gift
for you.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.160
It's that handmade wig.
I made it from doll hairs.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.496
You can wear it
on the "Wendy Williams Show."

16:03.530 --> 16:06.533
- Honey, you're very sweet
and very weird.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.635
Well, thank you very much
for the hospitality.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.670
And, hopefully,
I'll be seeing you soon.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.639
Come on, Malik,
let's go.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.044
- Oh, my God,
Staci, you're definitely

16:17.077 --> 16:19.479
gonna get that job
and be an executive producer

16:19.512 --> 16:21.548
in daytime television.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.450
- Oh, Penny,
that would've meant so much more

16:23.483 --> 16:26.019
if you didn't look
so fucking stupid.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.720
[energetic brass music]

16:29.589 --> 16:32.592
[knocks on door]
- I'm looking for a Mr. Mudd?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.562
- Hey, man!
Come on in!

16:35.595 --> 16:38.798
- Okay.
- Wow, look at you.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.733
Yeah, have a seat.
Thanks for coming here.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.469
I wanted to just get to know you
a little bit.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.237
I think you're
an interesting dude.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.506
- Thank you, I...
get that quite often.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.275
- So tell me about yourself.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.742
Where did you grow up?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.579
- Oh, um, my mom is not big
on specifics

16:52.612 --> 16:56.383
and I blocked out everything
before I was 15 years old.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.351
- Why do you suppose
that's the case?

16:58.385 --> 17:00.420
- I don't know,
but I have a huge scar

17:00.453 --> 17:03.390
in the shape of a horseshoe
on my right thigh

17:03.423 --> 17:07.160
and what a believe is a map
to a treasure chest

17:07.194 --> 17:09.129
tattooed on my back.

17:09.162 --> 17:14.801
I don't want to get dark,
but I think I have amnesia.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.170
Oh, well, there it is.
TMI.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.273
- Hey, I have a house
upstate.

17:20.307 --> 17:23.676
Um, would you want to,
maybe, spend some time with it?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.245
We can go up there
this weekend.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.546
- This isn't
one of those things

17:26.579 --> 17:28.515
where you lock me in a well,
is it?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.318
- No, I promise you.
I'm not going to abduct you.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.585
I just want
to get to know you.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.354
And I wanna get into your skin.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.190
Not your actual skin,
not like "Silence of the Lambs."

17:37.224 --> 17:38.558
Do you have a life's motto?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.627
Is there a way
you live your life?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.829
- Well,
I guess the big thing is...

17:42.862 --> 17:45.832
uh, I have to eat every day.
No matter what.

17:45.865 --> 17:49.136
- Sure.
- Um, when are we leaving?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.770
- [slaps knee]
How about now?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.173
- I mean, I'm supposed
to work till six,

17:53.206 --> 17:55.442
but, feh.
[chuckles]

17:55.475 --> 17:58.211
Yeah, let's do it.
[chuckles]

17:58.245 --> 17:59.679
- Oh, look at you.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.149
You ever been diagnosed with
Marfan's syndrome?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.683
- Is that what that guy
from "Rent" had?

18:03.716 --> 18:07.320
- No, that's AIDS.
- Hmm.
