change your song and all that other stuff.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.304
You do.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.099

05:54.645 --> 05:58.649

my dad and my grandfather ruined it.

He put you in military school!

07:09.178 --> 07:10.930
He's my pip-pop!

07:11.013 --> 07:14.725
But you took him from me.
You took my sister.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.562
Oh, why don't you
just dig up my mom too, huh?

07:17.645 --> 07:22.442
You can't miss her. She's under the patch
of concrete in our backyard.

-[sobbing]
-Jimmy, I wasn't trying to steal your dad.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.114

to my dad.

in the hospital.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.581
That place had prison vibes,

to think I was soft.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.378

Hey! Your name is Walt,

Okay, all right! You can ride.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.557

You'll make it, Frank.
I've already called ahead,

09:02.833 --> 09:07.338
and they're gonna clear the runway for us
so you can get to the hospital right away.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.508
Thanks. But don't think
this gets you off the hook with me.

09:10.591 --> 09:14.262
That's not why I did it!
And it does get me off the hook.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.056
-What are you two talking about?
-Ha!

09:17.139 --> 09:18.891
Of course you didn't tell them either.

Brandy's selling Mohican,
we're all getting fired,

as we speak.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.580
Selling Mohican wasn't my idea!

09:40.663 --> 09:43.291
But you didn't warn us about it either,
you fucking asshole!

09:43.374 --> 09:47.003
I tried to save the company,
but we weren't in profit!

09:47.086 --> 09:51.173
I scrimped and saved. I cut down
on the engine maintenance budget.

[Kevin] It's not
the most romantic basement in the world,

10:46.604 --> 10:49.523
but I can set the mood
with some birthday candles.

10:49.607 --> 10:53.319
It won't matter. Once I take
my glasses off, I can't see anything.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.029
You are so foxy.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.451
Kevin! Hey!

11:00.534 --> 11:01.911
Aw, it's good to see you.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.455
I'm Vic, you must be song-about girl.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.582
Vic, yeah, we were...

11:06.666 --> 11:11.003
We were actually just gonna go watch
some TV. For school.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.090
Oh, yeah, there's
some groovy stuff on these days.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.175
Have you see that dolphin show?

11:16.258 --> 11:19.553
It's just like the one with the bear
that rides around on the airboat.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.847
That bear is
about ten times better-looking

11:21.931 --> 11:23.182
than the little boy on the show.

11:23.265 --> 11:27.436
If I had a son that ugly, I'd want a bear
hanging around the house to look at too.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.693
Hey, listen, I just want to tell you
I'm sorry about how I acted yesterday.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.570
It's okay. I forgive you.
Could you move, please?

11:37.571 --> 11:38.531
-Hey there!
-[all gasp]

11:38.614 --> 11:40.032

11:40.116 --> 11:41.701
Ah, thank God you're here.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.203
I was waiting to tell you that, uh...

11:44.286 --> 11:46.247
your mom went to the hospital
to have the baby.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.332
My mom is at the hospital?

11:48.416 --> 11:51.001
And that's why I was down here
sniffing your combs.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.671
-This one's good.
-Holy shit!

11:53.754 --> 11:56.173
And my dad's not here.
I have to get to her.

11:56.257 --> 12:00.428
I'll take you, man. Anything for my Kev.
Come on, let's get in the Vic-mobile!

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
You're strange.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.727
I'm Goomer.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.395
[panting]

12:09.812 --> 12:10.813
You're gonna make it.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.440
-[bell rings]
-You're almost there.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
-Hey, fatty, why are you so fat?
-Get away from me.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.819
What'd you do, eat a whole person?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.529
Fuck off!

12:19.029 --> 12:19.947
[grunts]

12:20.531 --> 12:22.450
Ow, I scraped my knee!

12:22.533 --> 12:24.577
Oh, are you hurt?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.954
-[crying]
-There's a hospital two blocks that way.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.750
-You can walk there, you little shit.
-[groans]

12:34.962 --> 12:37.673
[pilot] <i>Ah, folks, if you look out</i>
<i>of the right side of the plane,</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:40.593
<i>you'll see the engine fire is dying down.</i>

12:40.676 --> 12:42.470
<i>And the Monongahela River.</i>

12:42.553 --> 12:44.096
As an apology for our troubles,

12:44.180 --> 12:47.141
please accept a voucher
for a free flight on Mohican

12:47.224 --> 12:51.896
-for as long as our silver eagles soar.
-[whispers] They're selling the company.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.690
Aw, Christ, why am I always
the last to know?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.901
They don't tell me anything.
Fuck this airline.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.028
<i>Give all the vouchers out.</i>

12:59.528 --> 13:01.030
First time almost dying, huh?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.240
Second or third for me.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.410
I'll tell you, the older you get,
the more you wish it happens.

13:07.828 --> 13:13.626
Oh, son of a bitch! I have to find
a way to fuck that mayor.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.127
[sighs]

13:15.211 --> 13:18.214
I can't believe we're the last of the guys
who will work for this airline.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.049
I promise you this.

13:20.132 --> 13:24.762
If there's a chance to save Mohican,
I'll do whatever I can.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.640
-Will you, really?
-Of course not!

13:27.723 --> 13:32.728
I'm gonna buy a boat!
[gasps] I'm so selfish.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.649
It's only a matter of time
before I get fat again.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.318
[gasps] I can't stop eating!

13:39.401 --> 13:40.528
[growls]

13:40.611 --> 13:44.740
It's like God doesn't want me
to be able to hide.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.951
[sobbing]

13:48.369 --> 13:51.038
I'm a terrible person.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.706
Yes, you are.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.544
But... and, you know, this might be
the almost-dying talking here,

13:56.627 --> 13:59.630
-but, uh... I forgive you.
-You do?

13:59.713 --> 14:02.341
You don't try to be
a miserable piece of shit.

14:02.424 --> 14:06.595
You're human. You do your best.
That's all any of us can do.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.013
Thanks, Frank.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.850
A miserable piece of shit
who can't change.

14:11.392 --> 14:15.104
Does that sound
like anyone else you know, Frank?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.649
Jesus Christ, that's my dad.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.985
I was talking about you,
you fucking chooch.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.197
Oh, my God. I've just been
holding onto this anger at my dad,

14:25.281 --> 14:26.574
and what good did it do?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.367
I have to let this go.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.704
And it took a part-time pornographer
to point it out.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.997
You're welcome.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.498
I feel so much better.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.167
I'll tell you, Father Pat was right.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.671
The only way to find peace
is through forgiveness.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.797
[horn honking]

14:41.881 --> 14:44.008
Watch the road, you ditzy twat!

14:44.091 --> 14:46.719
Blow it out your ass!

14:47.177 --> 14:48.971
You goddamn ingrate.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.890
Waits till I get over 70 to punch me.

14:50.973 --> 14:55.352
Ooh, if I was 60, he'd be hiding from me
like a dog who shit in the house.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.063
[chuckles] I'll get him.
Ooh, I'll get him good.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.943
[grunting]

15:03.027 --> 15:05.112
I think the acid just kicked in.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.822
There's a pregnant lady on a bike!

15:06.906 --> 15:08.824
Okay, the acid hasn't kicked in.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.367
Are you all right, ma'am?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.577
[panting]

15:11.660 --> 15:13.287
Please get this thing out of me.

15:13.370 --> 15:17.041
Don't you worry.
You're at the best hospital in the state.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.835
We got a lady with a bike stuck in her!

15:20.961 --> 15:22.004
[grunts]

15:24.715 --> 15:28.135
Come on, Rat!
Step on that overgrown ass-baby's throat!

15:29.219 --> 15:30.346
[both grunting]

15:31.096 --> 15:32.848
-[buzzer sounds]
-[grunts]

15:32.932 --> 15:34.808
What is this shit?

15:35.225 --> 15:38.437
Why didn't you hit that big moron
like I told you to?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.396
I-- I--

15:39.480 --> 15:43.817
Oh, don't you pussy out on me now.
Take him down, or you're off the team!

15:55.704 --> 15:57.831
-[Bill grunts]
-Ow!

15:57.915 --> 15:59.083
I hate kids.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.293
You're ejected!

16:01.835 --> 16:03.796
What the fuck was that?

16:03.879 --> 16:06.131
What am I supposed to do without my Rat?

16:06.215 --> 16:11.303
Coach, you've had the best rat
right under your nose this whole time.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.597
I'm surprised you didn't smell him.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.683
Jimmy Fitzsimmons?

16:16.892 --> 16:19.186
I could hurt kids, Papa.

16:20.562 --> 16:24.316
I can't remember
the last time I cried sober.

16:25.859 --> 16:31.198
Jimmy, from now on,
this C stands for "son."

16:42.459 --> 16:43.293
[grunts]

16:48.173 --> 16:49.925
Whoa! Ah!

16:50.009 --> 16:50.843
Yeah!

16:52.845 --> 16:53.929
[grunts]

16:55.681 --> 16:58.183
[yelling in slow motion]

17:00.769 --> 17:03.522
Come on, people, prep the birthing room!

17:03.605 --> 17:06.275
I need a bite rag and some shackles!

17:06.358 --> 17:09.987
-Get your filthy medicine away from her!
-They really ought to let us carry guns.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.407
-Samantha?
-You again? Stay out of our way.

17:13.490 --> 17:17.494
This lady's about to get
a hundred cc's of the goof juice.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.580
I am her womb Sherpa,

17:19.663 --> 17:22.958
and she's having this baby naturally,
even if it kills her.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.336
Enough! I'm through doing
what other people tell me to do.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.380
I got here today without any help,

17:28.464 --> 17:30.799
and I don't need you two maniacs
right now.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.052
This isn't your baby or your baby.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.430
It's my baby and my body,
and I will do it my fucking way.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.432
Oh, this seems like a fun day
to start here.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.351
Doctor, I want to be awake
when my baby is born,

17:41.435 --> 17:43.645
but I also want to take
a whole lot of painkillers.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.899
Absolutely, yes, of course.
Just don't hurt me.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.862
You know, it's really fucked up
that Jimmy Fitzsimmons

17:51.945 --> 17:54.698
had to show us what a normal family is.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.325
We're not that bad, are we?

17:56.408 --> 18:00.579
Come out and face your father
like a man, Francine!

18:00.662 --> 18:01.914
Uh... yes.

18:01.997 --> 18:05.375
I got something to say to you, tough guy!

18:05.459 --> 18:07.294
-Grandpa?
-Oh.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.339
Uh... [chuckles] Hey, kids. Uh...

18:10.422 --> 18:14.384
I'm just here to give your dad
an early Christmas present.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.594
He's in Cleveland.

18:15.677 --> 18:20.140
Yeah, so you can't hit him
with his Christmas present just yet.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.184
Holy shit.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.522
[Vic] You know, man, I think I just got
so crazy about your band

18:26.605 --> 18:29.983
'cause, you know, the truth is
I have an emptiness in my life

18:30.067 --> 18:34.196
that I was trying to fill with music
and drugs and musical drugs.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.614
[chuckles]

18:35.697 --> 18:39.451
That's a game where, when the music stops,
you do drugs.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.287
Vic, not now, okay? I have to see my mom!

18:42.371 --> 18:44.414
Not with that attitude you won't!

18:44.498 --> 18:46.750
Go take a seat
with the rest of the bleeders.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.754
Hey! My mom is about to have a baby,
and she's all by herself.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.298
But I am here. I am 15 years old,

18:53.382 --> 18:56.927
and I should totally be having sex
with my girlfriend right now.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.220
But I am not!

18:58.303 --> 19:01.014
My balls are bluer than the sky!

19:01.098 --> 19:05.936
So let me see my mom,
you shriveled-up old lady dildo!

19:06.019 --> 19:10.107
Ah, let me guess, another Murphy.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.819
-Oh, I hope I'm not too late.
-Drive like the wind, Frank.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.530
And if you're stopped by the police,
don't panic.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.073
You're white!

19:18.574 --> 19:20.659
I'm gonna get down to City Hall

19:20.742 --> 19:24.246
and show that mayor I can beat him
at his own game.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.251
I'm gonna go find a way
to save this airline.

19:30.127 --> 19:34.506
And I'm gonna do some poppers
and try to suck my own cock.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.758
Wish me luck.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.761
Mom! Am I an uncle yet?

19:39.845 --> 19:43.015
-Not yet. Is your dad here?
-No.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.183
[whimpers]

19:44.266 --> 19:47.895
Your father's gonna miss another one.
[screams]

19:47.978 --> 19:50.606
I don't know what to do.
I flunked home ec.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.858
I couldn't figure out
how to put on the apron.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.319
You'll be fine.
Just-- Just help her relax.

19:55.402 --> 20:00.490
-I don't know how to do that.
-No, but I bet Maui Mike does.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.024
Thanks, Mom.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.943
And I'm here for you.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.070
I'm not gonna leave your side.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.242
Oh, gross. I'll see you in a little bit.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.662
Sounds like you made your mom feel better.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.872
That's because you make me feel better.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.459
Hey, there you are. Okay, where was I?

20:52.542 --> 20:54.461
I was trying to fill a void in my soul--

20:54.544 --> 20:57.172
Vic! Look, you don't have
to explain yourself.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.424
It's okay. It really is.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.176
Your life isn't empty.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.012
You're Vic Reynolds.
Nobody else can say that.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.555
Thanks, man. Hey,

21:05.639 --> 21:08.767
you want to get some soft-serve
in the cafeteria? My treat.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.687
They got the kind
where the two flavors swirl.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.899
Thanks, Vic, but if you don't mind,
Alice and I want some privacy.

21:18.360 --> 21:23.115
Well, Vic, it finally happened.
Teenagers don't think you're cool anymore.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.617
You're all alone.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.036
Never should've left the seminary.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.457
We're here to see Sue Murphy,
and we don't want any of your--

21:32.541 --> 21:35.460
Go. Delivery room one.

21:35.544 --> 21:40.549
If I can't drug a woman
into a delirious stupor, what's the point?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.844
Grandpa, you shouldn't be here.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.345
Why don't you go home?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.806
We don't want another fight breaking out
if Dad shows up.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.975
Your father started that fight,
and I just--

21:50.058 --> 21:51.310
I saw it.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.646
You were the one that made him mad.
And then you told him to punch you.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.399
I don't know what you did to our dad
when you were his dad,

21:57.482 --> 22:00.152
but you really messed him up.

for the win.

Mr. Mayor, you just lost
your seventh vote for that dog track.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.347
But it's not all bad news.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.932
-I got you a library card.
-Who flipped?

22:31.016 --> 22:35.645
Somebody who likes to fly down
to visit his mistress in Fort Lauderdale.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.024

22:41.818 --> 22:44.488
So I guess you think
you're the big dog now.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.491
No. I'm a junkyard dog.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.951
You win. For now.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.036

Oh, Christ, I really fucked him up.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.356
I just could never admit it.
Not even to myself.

You did what you could. Like all of us.

23:23.151 --> 23:28.615
I truly thought a nurse's job
was to pass judgment on the sick.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.743
All this time there's been
something missing in my life.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.955
I have nothing with real meaning.
I... And I never knew it.

23:35.038 --> 23:38.458
Don't blame yourself.
Men weren't designed to have depth.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.128
Yeah, God is a fucker.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.005
-I'm looking for my wife.
-Right in here, pal.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.882
[overlapping talking]

23:45.966 --> 23:47.926
Jesus Christ! Get me out of here!

23:48.009 --> 23:49.761
Back! Back, all of youse!

23:49.845 --> 23:50.720
[grunts]

23:50.804 --> 23:52.180
Sue! Where are you?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.558
Good to see you, Frank.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.144
I see the two-headed baby told you
about my back surgery

23:57.227 --> 23:59.980
after Goliath the elephant
tossed me through that storefront.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.357
That elephant is stronger
than he looks, Frank.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.818
That's because he's an African elephant
and not Indian.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.361
Bet you didn't know that, Frank, did you?

24:06.445 --> 24:09.072
Will you stop saying my fucking name?
I got to go!

24:09.781 --> 24:11.032
-[all scream]
-Dad!

24:11.116 --> 24:12.784
I don't want to see your face
when I have a boner!

24:12.868 --> 24:15.537
If I have a grandkid that's
nine months younger than my next kid,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.664
I guarantee you, I will kill you.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.168
Nice to see you again, Alice.

24:25.630 --> 24:29.092
Ah, shit, I think that plane crashed.
This is hell, isn't it?

24:29.176 --> 24:31.511
Son, I'm... I'm so sorry for--

24:31.595 --> 24:33.555
-Dad, it's okay.
-[sobbing]

24:33.638 --> 24:38.101
No, you don't understand.
I have so much to say to you.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.938
I was ready to bust you open
with a tire iron today. I--

24:42.022 --> 24:45.984
I had worked it all out in my head,
what I was gonna tell the police--

24:46.067 --> 24:48.028
Dad! Mom's down the hall.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.447
Pop, I got to go.
But we can do this later.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.366
I'll see you in a bit.
And I'll see you in hell.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.203
I'm coming, Sue!

24:56.703 --> 25:01.249
How could a nice gentleman like you
raise such an asshole?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.084
Beatrice, we need you
in delivery room two.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.795
There's a woman going into labor,
and she's demanding twilight sleep.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.090
Ooh-hoo-hoo! It's Bea's time to shine!

25:09.174 --> 25:12.135
Oh, no, you don't, you angel of death!

25:13.845 --> 25:14.721
[groans]

25:14.804 --> 25:17.265
[woman] Put all the drugs inside me!

25:17.349 --> 25:18.683
Hey, that sounds like...

25:19.809 --> 25:21.144
[grunting]

25:22.187 --> 25:25.398
Wait a second,
I know that stretched-out yow-yow.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.608
Hey, Vic.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.235
[chuckles]

25:28.318 --> 25:30.028
Ooh, this is a little awkward, huh?

25:30.111 --> 25:32.614
-Karen?
-Now you know my name?

25:32.697 --> 25:34.157
It says it on your chart.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.618
This baby's yours, and I'm not keeping it.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.330
I'm this close to being assistant manager
at the reindeer rental center.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.833
You're having my baby?
And you're sure it's mine?

25:43.917 --> 25:46.586
You're the only guy I've been with
that didn't wear a condom.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.130
You know I'm allergic to it
when it doesn't feel good.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.677
Are you okay?

25:53.760 --> 25:57.556
Oh, cutie pie,
you beautiful, cheating-ass bitch,

25:57.639 --> 26:00.016
you've given me a reason to live again.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.394
I think my heart just came.

26:04.479 --> 26:08.567
Sue, I made it in time.
Ah, thank God you were in labor all day!

26:09.276 --> 26:10.860
That didn't come out right.
You know what I mean.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.196
Oh, Frank, you're here.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.240
I never should've left.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.828
Sue, I swear to you,
I'm not gonna fuck up this kid.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.998
Starting now, I'm gonna be
a better husband. I am gonna--

26:23.081 --> 26:25.959
Two-and-a-half pine cones!

26:26.042 --> 26:27.711
[groans]

26:34.134 --> 26:35.260
[cries]

26:41.016 --> 26:44.352
Kids, you're gonna be babysitting
this little girl for free

26:44.436 --> 26:45.812
for the next ten years.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.105
This is your family.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.481
-Oh!
-Cool!

26:48.565 --> 26:50.984
-Ah.
-Aw. Hi, baby.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.153
Oh, my God, she has no arms!

26:53.236 --> 26:56.823
This is your brother Kevin.
You'll be smarter than him in two weeks.

26:56.906 --> 26:57.991
[all laughing]

26:58.074 --> 26:58.908
That's true.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.412
Just to let you know,
we're a pretty messed-up family, okay?

27:02.495 --> 27:03.705
But we stick together.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.460
Come on, my little angel, there's someone
in the chapel who wants to meet you.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.755
Dad, your granddaughter's here.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.008
Oh, this is your grandpa.
He's a hell of a guy.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.011
Did you know
he could sell snowballs to Eskimos?

27:18.970 --> 27:20.096
Right, Dad?

27:22.557 --> 27:25.352
Oh, here we go.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.895
Here we go for what?

27:27.729 --> 27:28.772
Dad?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.149
Dad?

27:32.859 --> 27:34.361
