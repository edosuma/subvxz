00:15.800 --> 00:16.915
Buon giorno, Norm.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.474
Cliffie.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.432
Yeah.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.036
- Kind of bright out there today, huh?
- Yeah, I wouldn't know.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.793
Yeah.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.958
I feel sorry for all those
people that have to squint.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.350
Say, Cliff, those wouldn't be
new glasses, would they?

00:34.520 --> 00:36.590
Oh, hey, you noticed, huh?

00:36.760 --> 00:40.309
Yeah, ltalian imports.
Sixty-five smack-a-roonies.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.040
That's right. Notice the sleek,
European styling there,

00:43.200 --> 00:45.191
the sturdy reinforced frames,

00:45.360 --> 00:47.590
and the hi-tech, shatterproof
reflective lenses

00:47.760 --> 00:49.273
that allow me to scope out the dollies

00:49.440 --> 00:52.671
without drawing attention to myself.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.755
You could walk up to them naked
with your hair on fire

00:55.920 --> 00:58.593
and not draw attention to yourself.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.230
Yeah? What would you know?
They only work on women.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.629
You!

01:04.800 --> 01:08.236
They seem to have given you courage.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.557
- Prove it.
- Well, what do you mean?

01:11.720 --> 01:14.234
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing
a little demonstration myself.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.271
- So...
- All right, all right.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.032
All right. All right!

01:18.200 --> 01:21.237
You've got the shades.
What are you worrying about?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.752
Excuse me.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.388
Oh, perfect!

01:43.400 --> 01:45.197
Thanks.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.872
Well, I don't care what anybody says,
we had better chatter out there.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.150
Shut up, Cliff.

03:04.440 --> 03:08.479
Sounds suspiciously as if
there is no joy in Mudville.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.677
Who gives a damn? We lost.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.395
We didn't lose.
We got dumped on.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.120
We were dragged by our noses
through the dung heap.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.430
They ripped out our guts,
held them up for us to see,

03:20.600 --> 03:23.114
and then they rammed them
down our throats.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.153
It's a grand old game.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.719
Damn!

03:27.880 --> 03:29.996
Now I know why they weren't afraid
to let me play.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.229
They were great out there.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.550
They were like the '27 Yankees.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.718
He's exaggerating.
There were only nine of them.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.317
Come on, guys. We can't just
sit around crying in our beer here.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.953
- Norman's right.
- We don't have any.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.918
Come on, Diane, step on it, will you.
I feel a tear welling up here.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.633
What the hell?
First round on the house.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.677
Hey, Sammy!

03:49.880 --> 03:52.997
Yeah, well, if you think I'm drinking
with you guys, you're nuts!

03:53.160 --> 03:56.755
I'd rather drink with those snail pellets
from Gary's Old Towne Tavern.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.150
- At least they're winners.
- That really hurts, Carla.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.470
Hey, really, I don't think we played
so bad, you know.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.677
- Listen to Mr Gold Glove over here.
- Come on!

04:04.840 --> 04:06.876
Yeah? You drew more flies
than bad liver.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.359
Oh, give me a break!

04:09.120 --> 04:12.351
The only thing more amazing than that
was you dropped every one of them.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.877
Come on, will you. I just have a little
problem with balls hit directly at me.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.639
The...

04:18.800 --> 04:20.392
I think it's probably
the sun, you know,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.358
or that I can't bend over.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.599
Poor Norman.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.830
Well, at least some of us
looked good out there, huh?

04:32.080 --> 04:36.073
Yeah, Cliff, the less of your
face showing, the better.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.392
Oh, listen to yourselves.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.951
You're letting a minor setback
in some trivial competition

04:43.120 --> 04:45.634
ruin what is an otherwise lovely day.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.879
Forget it, Sam.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.673
You just don't get it, do you?

04:51.840 --> 04:56.834
It's not just that the guys from Gary's
beat us at basketball, volleyball, darts

04:57.000 --> 04:59.468
and every other sport
known to mankind.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.471
It's more than that.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.993
I'm a jock.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.594
This is a jock bar,
but if we keep losing,

05:05.760 --> 05:08.320
all the jocks are gonna say,
"Hey, Cheers is for losers.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.072
Let's go drink over at Gary's."

05:10.280 --> 05:11.633
Oh, they'll never say that.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.677
They'll say, "Me no like Cheers.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.308
Let's go to Gary's."

05:29.000 --> 05:31.878
Gentlemen of Cheers. And ladies.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.598
- Tough game out there today.
- What are you doing here?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.193
Boy, you guys have the worst luck.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.120
Yeah, it looks like it just
followed us home, huh?

05:40.320 --> 05:42.788
Listen, we were over having
a celebration at my little tavern

05:42.960 --> 05:45.554
and I kept thinking,
"Something's missing."

05:45.720 --> 05:48.280
It wasn't as happy as it usually is
when we beat you.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.635
And then I realized what it was.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.598
I didn't get a chance to thank you
guys for the game.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.638
So I came over here to do it now.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.956
Way to go.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.869
The pop-up king.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.717
Many thanks.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.279
Great glasses.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.271
This is what I was afraid of.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.590
Hard feelings.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.395
What are you talking about?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.989
You guys have nothing
to hang your heads about.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.432
You played hard. You played clean.
You gave it your all.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.349
Just remember, it takes two sides
to make a victory.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.195
One side to win and you guys.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.037
Excuse me, but you've obviously
come here to belittle my friends.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.519
Why? I can only speculate.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.468
Perhaps you're compensating for some
physical shortcoming. I don't know.

06:43.720 --> 06:49.272
But it's tragic that you place
such stock in a silly competition.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.113
What of higher attainments?
What of loftier pursuits?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.636
What of art? And philosophy?
What of music?

06:57.240 --> 07:00.516
I graduated magna cum laude
in American Literature from Princeton.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.757
Oh? Couldn't make summa?

07:06.920 --> 07:09.559
Hey, look, Gar. You only came here
to rub our noses in it.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.472
You've done a great job.
Mission accomplished.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.675
Now why don't you take off.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.438
- Yeah, take a hike.
- Sam,

07:14.720 --> 07:17.359
I came here in the
spirit of sportsmanship.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.478
I'll show you sportsmanship.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.794
People! People!

07:25.040 --> 07:28.237
This is neither the time nor the place
for such childish behaviour.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.278
Yeah, let's save it
for when we kick his butt.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.711
In what? We're kind of running out
of sports, aren't we?

07:37.160 --> 07:40.470
Well, it's really been
a truly enjoyable afternoon.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.073
Gentlemen, ladies.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.355
- See you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.909
Listen, I'll have you know
that I'm putting together a team

07:46.080 --> 07:49.595
right this moment, that's gonna have
you shaking in those shoes of yours.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.075
Hey, those are nice.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.512
Well, thanks. And is that a challenge?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.597
- Yeah.
- In what sport?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.671
I'll tell you in what sport.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.114
In...

08:01.280 --> 08:03.111
- Bowling.
- Yeah, bowling.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.232
Great! I've knocked down
a pin or two in my day.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.470
- When and where?
- Well, I'll just let you know.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.232
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.469
Okay.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.755
- Okay.
- Okay!

08:12.920 --> 08:14.273
- Okay!
- Okay!

08:14.440 --> 08:16.795
- Okay!
- Okay!

08:19.480 --> 08:20.595
Bowling?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.028
Don't worry.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.315
I got this theory, Sam.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.917
You see, all of those other sports
required real athletic ability,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.918
but with bowling, we got the makings
of a great team!

08:31.080 --> 08:32.798
- Oh, Carla, l...
- Oh, listen, listen!

08:32.960 --> 08:35.235
You go to any bowling alley,
what do you see?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.515
A bunch of out-of-shape
couch potatoes

08:37.679 --> 08:40.638
who do nothing but sit around
and swill beer.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.717
All right, we're number one!

08:52.080 --> 08:54.594
Back so soon from the sport
of the great unwashed?

08:57.320 --> 08:58.912
How was the audition?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.069
Tryout.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.312
Diane, in sports, it's called a tryout.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.994
- We got a team.
- Yeah, of what, I'd like to know.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.794
I'm gonna call Gary and call it off.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.469
I'm telling you, when one lousy bar
can't produce four decent bowlers,

09:14.640 --> 09:19.031
it's time for America to take
a long, hard look at itself.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.078
Hey, you!

09:29.720 --> 09:31.551
You don't know anything
about bowling, do you?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.874
Hey, Woodhead...

09:40.440 --> 09:42.510
...I asked you if you know
how to bowl.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.589
You have bowled, haven't you?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.113
- Yes.
- When?

09:53.280 --> 09:55.191
- When?
- Before.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.636
- Before what?
- Before I came to Cheers.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.030
You're good, aren't you?

10:02.720 --> 10:05.154
I won a couple trophies.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.352
Sammy. Sam, Sam, don't--
Don't call it off!

10:09.520 --> 10:11.112
What? What? Hold on a second.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.952
- We got a ringer.
- Got a what?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.634
We got a ringer. Woody.
Woody is a bowling machine.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.990
Trust me. He's got a room
full of trophies.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.798
Hey, Gar.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.916
No, we're not wimping out.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.433
Yeah, tomorrow.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.592
Vic's Bowl-A-Rama. We rumble.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.269
Okay!

10:30.440 --> 10:32.112
Okay!

10:33.240 --> 10:35.435
- All right, Woody!
- Woody!

10:35.600 --> 10:37.591
Please don't ask me to bowl. I can't.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.349
Why not?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.033
The tragedy.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.953
- Well, what tragedy?
- What tragedy?

10:46.320 --> 10:49.869
Once I maimed a man
in a bowling accident.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.556
I'll never bowl again as long as I live.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.996
Great idea, Sam. Bowling.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.274
Okay, it's time to go.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.312
Let's see if we can, you know,

11:18.480 --> 11:22.473
maybe somehow manage
not to embarrass ourselves.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.075
Ladies and gentlemen, Knute Rockne.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.191
Come on, let's go. I wanna warm up.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.274
Hold on a second, guys.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.557
Say, Woody, it's still not too late
to change your mind.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.990
Don't you understand?
I maimed a man.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.917
Bowling accidents happen. You read
about them in the paper all the time.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.715
He was only an innocent
maintenance man.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.388
Come on, man. He knew the risks.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.919
I still don't know what happened.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.311
One minute, I was picking up
the eight-ten split,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.710
and the next thing I know,
the ten pin flies

11:59.880 --> 12:01.677
and hits old Sully
right between the eyes

12:01.840 --> 12:04.832
and he goes down
like a sack of wheat.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.475
Sam, I ruined the man's life.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.874
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.359
Oh, no. No, I'm not.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.597
Old Sully got too dim-witted
to stay in bowling maintenance.

12:13.760 --> 12:18.038
Last I heard, he was a clown
at children's birthday parties.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.509
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- He wasn't invited to them.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.836
Come on, Woody.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.958
Listen, man, I've never begged
for anything in my life

12:27.560 --> 12:29.437
that I actually enjoyed once I got it.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.789
Come on.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.713
Please. Come on,
join the team here.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.638
We need you, Woody. Come on.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.549
I can't! Since the accident, I haven't
been able to set foot in a bowling alley.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.558
Well, why don't you just try it today.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.153
Maybe the memory's faded.

12:45.360 --> 12:49.672
- You don't understand what's at stake.
- Can't you hear me? No!

12:50.440 --> 12:53.637
Sammy, I'll take a crack at him here.

12:54.760 --> 12:55.749
Listen to me, all right?

12:55.920 --> 12:59.879
Now, every once in a while you just
gotta look beyond yourself, okay?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.270
And think about the team.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.670
Like my old high school football coach
used to always say:

13:04.840 --> 13:07.559
"Give the ball to Peterson.
He'll know what to do with it."

13:07.720 --> 13:09.597
Well, hey, I didn't want
that responsibility,

13:09.760 --> 13:12.672
but for the good of the team,
you understand,

13:12.840 --> 13:14.193
I took it.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.555
We went ahead
and we had a great season.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.393
- Were you the fullback?
- No, I was the equipment manager.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.516
- But that's not my point.
- Oh, come on, Norm.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.432
You're wasting your breath.
He ain't bowling.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.352
All right, think about that, Woody.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.838
Go team!

13:47.120 --> 13:49.680
Yeah! Not too shabby.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.558
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!

13:52.240 --> 13:53.389
Old Towne Tavern!

13:53.600 --> 13:55.397
- Old Towne Tavern!
- Quiet, you guys.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.279
Let's show our worthy opponent
a little courtesy.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.558
Back off, buster, or I'll put Vaseline
in your finger holes.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.518
Just try to touch my ball.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.870
I'm talking about your nose.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.710
- Choke on it!
- Choke on it!

14:22.920 --> 14:26.196
You got the cheering under control.
I'll mosey up to the bar for a beer.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.272
- You're gonna miss the game, Norm.
- Then that's a perfect plan, huh?

14:29.760 --> 14:31.716
Hey, Cliffie, how're we doing here?

14:32.400 --> 14:35.995
Fifty pins down,
sinking like a stone, Sammy.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.119
Norm!

14:40.720 --> 14:42.073
How the hell they know him here?

14:42.440 --> 14:43.668
He's got a life, you know.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.952
That's all right, man. It's okay.
It's okay.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.349
Hey, Tawny,

14:49.520 --> 14:52.557
has anyone ever told you you make
even bowling shoes look sexy?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.753
Don't you ever stop?
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.793
No, I'm just trying to distract her here
so she won't know what to do.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.070
A little wink, a sexy nod,

15:01.240 --> 15:04.755
and a glimpse of these
taut athletic buns.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.717
Oh, wait a second here, Tawny.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.035
Oh, what's this?

15:19.880 --> 15:22.155
I think your butt needs a tune-up.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.590
- Sam.
- Hey, what're you doing here?

15:24.760 --> 15:25.988
I'm here as a driver only,

15:26.160 --> 15:28.390
but I brought someone with me
who'd like to bowl.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.120
- Woody!
- Woody!

15:31.280 --> 15:32.508
Hey, time out, Gary.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.511
- Who's taking care of the bar here?
- Oh, don't worry. We closed it.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.638
We would have been here sooner, but
it took a while to get those people out.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.831
Oh, well, great. Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.275
All right, go get some shoes on here.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.311
Woody!

15:52.280 --> 15:54.874
- What made him change his mind?
- I don't know.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.640
He was right in the middle
of doing something and he said,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.358
"l can't let the guys down. Let's go."

15:59.720 --> 16:00.709
Hey, Woody!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.996
How are we gonna do this?
We've already started here.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.952
Cliff, what about your wrist injury?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.748
- What injury?
- Don't make me hurt you.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.115
Easy, easy.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.794
Gary, we're gonna need
an injury substitution here.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.473
Hey, you got it.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.676
The one thing I've never been
called is unfair.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.195
I can believe that's the one thing
you've never been called.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.716
All right, I'm gonna go
fire Woody up here.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.434
The alleys. Thanks.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.876
It's really a sensory experience,
you know.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.958
The scent of Aqua Net
on a beehive hairdo.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.759
The roar of polyester
against old Naugahyde.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.514
The sight of a cigarette stubbed out
in a patty melt.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.998
All this, plus the anticipation
of placing your feet in shoes

16:46.160 --> 16:48.879
only 7,000 others
have worn before you.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.279
Woody! Yeah!

16:51.480 --> 16:53.152
All right! Let's go!

16:54.960 --> 16:57.713
Listen, if this is gonna be
tough on you,

16:57.880 --> 16:59.791
I want you to know that you
don't have to do this.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.552
No, I want to, Sam.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.789
You're absolutely sure?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.877
Oh, I'm sure.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.553
You all have been like family to me.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.638
I love you guys.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.397
Okay, all right, Woody.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.719
- Watch this, Gar.
- Yeah.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.951
If you're having second thoughts,
that's okay, pal.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.479
No, no, I want to do this.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.314
- Okay, I'm ready.
- All right. All right.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.232
- Woody?
- I wanna do this, Sam.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.389
Remember, I love you guys.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.074
I'm ready, Sam.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.559
It's okay, Woody.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.233
I'm gonna bowl.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.914
I don't know what I was worried about.
This is easy.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.789
Those guys are dead meat.
You know what I'm saying, Sam?

18:22.680 --> 18:25.513
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

18:26.560 --> 18:28.710
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!

18:28.880 --> 18:29.869
Old Towne Tavern!

18:30.040 --> 18:32.076
Old Towne Tavern!

18:33.040 --> 18:35.873
- Hey, nice game, Sam.
- Oh, get out of here.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.315
We said two out of three,
and we're taking you to the wall.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.833
That's right!

18:40.040 --> 18:43.635
All right, all of you in favour of saving
what shred of dignity we have left

18:43.800 --> 18:46.439
and sneaking out of here,
raise your hands.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.750
That's one...

18:50.360 --> 18:52.794
Hey, how come you voted?
You're not even playing.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.159
I thought we were ordering pizza.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.434
Sam, we can't quit.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.310
Listen, Sam, maybe we can
sweeten the pot a little.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.233
- Get out of here, will you.
- No, no, no.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.630
If you guys win,

19:08.800 --> 19:09.869
I'll set you up with Tawny.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.956
Maybe we can talk.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.799
And if we win,

19:16.280 --> 19:20.751
you set me up with the
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.231
Excuse me.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.911
I didn't date Sigma Chis.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.479
I was Phi Epsilon Delta.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.352
You girls had quite a reputation.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.674
Yes, for academic achievement.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.031
Is that what it was?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.715
Tell me, isn't it true that Phi Epsilon
is Greek for "Hi, sailor"?

19:41.560 --> 19:42.913
Give me your shoes.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.513
Give me your shoes.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.712
- Oh, Diane, are you bowling?
- Yes.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.917
- Come on. Well, are you any good?
- Yes.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.157
And if you whisper a word of this
to anyone who matters,

19:54.320 --> 19:56.117
I'll find you and I'll kill you.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.355
Did you think I came by my utter
contempt for the sport by accident?

20:01.520 --> 20:02.794
Hardly.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.075
I took it in college.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.075
- You bowled in college?
- Yes.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.593
I needed the PE credits.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.633
I could read between frames,
and you didn't have to run.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.588
I spent six semesters sweating
in a tawdry bowling alley.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.557
Bowlers don't sweat.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.917
They do when they're wearing tweed.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.316
In spite of my complete disdain
for the experience,

20:25.480 --> 20:29.155
I have no intention of letting this
lvy League lounge lizard

20:29.320 --> 20:32.710
insult me and my sorority sisters

20:32.920 --> 20:37.198
and send Cheers
to ignominious defeat.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.669
Your mama!

21:05.120 --> 21:06.519
Chambers! Chambers!

21:06.680 --> 21:09.353
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

21:13.080 --> 21:14.832
- Chambers! Chambers!
- Thank you! Thank you!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.479
Now put me down!

21:16.640 --> 21:19.074
I'm afraid of heights,
and someone has very cold hands.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.111
Okay, everybody, line up.
I'm pouring beers.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.671
I gotta hand it to you, Whitey.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.955
For once, you did something

21:29.120 --> 21:31.270
that didn't make me wanna
shove a rat in your mouth

21:31.440 --> 21:32.475
and sew your lips shut.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.469
Such praise. I blush.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.831
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Yeah. Thank you.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.949
Oh, excuse me. Continue celebrating.
Huzzah, huzzah.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.236
- It was a great win, wasn't it, Sam?
- Yeah, it was.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.868
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.999
I've been amply rewarded just seeing
how well you're taking this.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.550
The old Sam Malone would have died

22:00.720 --> 22:04.474
before letting a woman
salvage his athletic pride.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.832
- You've grown.
- You know something?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.276
I think I have. Oh, by the way.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.911
Tawny wasn't the only one looking
sexy out there in bowling shoes.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.148
Well, thank you.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.635
No, oh, no, no. I was talking about me.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.716
You know, I'm surprised
you didn't mention something.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.836
No, seriously, seriously.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.879
Great form out there.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.230
- Thank you.
- No, no, I was still talking about me.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.951
All right, all jokes aside here,
thank you very much

22:37.120 --> 22:39.315
for helping me beat Gary.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.392
Well,

22:41.560 --> 22:45.439
I was getting tired of listening
to some ignorant blowhard

22:45.600 --> 22:49.275
take himself and some stupid
competition so seriously.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.078
Boy, he really does that, doesn't he?

22:51.240 --> 22:53.356
No, I was talking about you.
