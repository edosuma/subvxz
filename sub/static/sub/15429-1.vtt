00:19.828 --> 00:22.217
You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

00:23.572 --> 00:25.033
You gotta have it figured out.

00:27.315 --> 00:28.297
Those are the rules.

00:36.852 --> 00:39.569
How you get in,
how you get out,

00:39.603 --> 00:41.359
how many shots
you're gonna need.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.940
Make sure you know
where everybody is.

00:46.292 --> 00:48.080
Make sure nobody sees you.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.808
Don't hang around.

00:53.843 --> 00:56.232
Don't get interested.

00:56.275 --> 00:58.163
Then you
don't make mistakes.

01:42.451 --> 01:43.978
Yeah.

01:44.019 --> 01:45.197
How'd you like
to go to Detroit

01:45.235 --> 01:47.569
and see a man in a hotel
Friday morning?

01:48.883 --> 01:50.444
I don't do that anymore.

01:52.051 --> 01:53.545
I'll double your price.

01:53.587 --> 01:55.497
You can do
whatever you want.

01:57.555 --> 01:59.857
Can't hear you, chief.

01:59.891 --> 02:01.833
I'm taking it
this guy in the hotel

02:01.875 --> 02:04.264
is somebody you don't want
to look in the face.

02:05.684 --> 02:07.375
I'm thinking maybe
it's the old man

02:07.411 --> 02:10.346
with the big house
you want to move into.

02:10.388 --> 02:12.973
Guy past his time,

02:13.012 --> 02:14.703
and he don't like
how you do things.

02:14.739 --> 02:16.365
Hey, fuck you.
I'll get somebody else.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.054
You don't have
no somebody else.

02:19.091 --> 02:21.993
You call me when your people
won't do it.

02:22.035 --> 02:23.497
You want to leave it
all behind, chief,

02:23.539 --> 02:25.197
here's your chance.

02:28.851 --> 02:32.845
You have a Cadillac...
a blue one.

02:32.883 --> 02:33.832
Yeah.

02:35.379 --> 02:36.362
Throw that in there,

02:36.404 --> 02:37.713
you'll never see me
again.

02:39.699 --> 02:42.121
You can collect your money
next Tuesday.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.651
Union Station, usual place.

02:44.692 --> 02:46.285
He'll have a girl with him.

02:46.323 --> 02:47.533
She'll let you in.

03:12.467 --> 03:13.515
Papa.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.306
Yeah?

03:16.339 --> 03:17.713
You got somethin' for me?

03:19.027 --> 03:20.554
From your son-in-law.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.716
Oh, Christ.

03:26.995 --> 03:29.002
I told my daughter,
"Don't marry that punk."

03:29.044 --> 03:30.636
She don't listen.

03:30.675 --> 03:32.813
I give him six months.

03:32.851 --> 03:34.826
There'll be another funeral.

03:34.868 --> 03:36.209
You want him done
sooner than that,

03:36.243 --> 03:37.421
you tell me.

03:38.995 --> 03:40.206
Who the hell are you?

03:40.243 --> 03:41.869
You don't remember?

03:41.907 --> 03:43.216
Should I?

03:43.252 --> 03:45.641
You know
Walpole Island, Papa?

03:45.683 --> 03:46.893
It's an Indian reserve.

03:46.932 --> 03:49.037
My grandmother lives there.

03:49.075 --> 03:50.733
She's a medicine woman.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.601
She was going to turn me
into an owl one time.

03:54.643 --> 03:57.491
I told her,
"I don't want to be no owl.

03:57.523 --> 03:59.760
I want to be a blackbird."

03:59.795 --> 04:01.737
That's how I got my name.

04:01.779 --> 04:03.689
Blackbird.

04:03.731 --> 04:04.844
You remember now.

04:04.883 --> 04:06.705
The Degas brothers,

04:06.740 --> 04:08.016
one killed working for you,

04:08.051 --> 04:10.440
shot dead in the hospital,

04:10.484 --> 04:12.818
the other one doing life
in Kingston.

04:12.851 --> 04:14.510
I'm the only one left.

04:18.738 --> 04:19.688
Huh.

04:20.947 --> 04:22.922
Can she do that?

04:22.964 --> 04:24.654
Turn you into an owl?

04:24.691 --> 04:26.763
If she want to.

04:26.804 --> 04:29.422
I could use
a woman like that.

04:40.148 --> 04:42.417
I'd like to be dressed.

04:42.451 --> 04:44.012
Is that okay with you?

04:45.171 --> 04:46.578
Whatever you want.

05:16.915 --> 05:18.192
Are you through?

05:18.227 --> 05:19.176
Not yet.

05:20.243 --> 05:23.920
# My, my #

05:23.955 --> 05:28.013
# Little white lies #

05:28.051 --> 05:32.361
# Swear I'm gonna
make it right #

05:32.403 --> 05:35.665
# This time #

05:35.699 --> 05:39.758
# Start the radio #

05:39.795 --> 05:43.789
# Turn it way down low #

05:43.827 --> 05:48.529
# Tellin' me things
I do not know #

05:48.563 --> 05:51.378
# I know #

05:52.339 --> 05:56.780
And it could be used equally
as a recreation room or a den.

05:56.819 --> 05:58.063
Look in here, Dan.

05:58.099 --> 06:00.434
Quite a lovely,
distinctive entrance hall,

06:00.467 --> 06:04.428
which is so practical
and elegant, don't you think?

06:04.467 --> 06:05.777
Thank you.

06:19.187 --> 06:22.799
# Now who's to blame? #

06:22.835 --> 06:24.777
# You used to be the same #

06:24.819 --> 06:27.470
Wayne! Foreman!

06:30.355 --> 06:31.337
What?!

06:31.379 --> 06:33.484
What?!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.359
# It's a suicide #

06:37.395 --> 06:39.053
And don't bother
comin' back!

06:39.091 --> 06:42.058
# Shut up and drive #

06:44.787 --> 06:46.162
Mrs. Palino.

06:46.195 --> 06:47.821
Richie Nix.

06:47.859 --> 06:50.707
You were my foster mom
for a while.

06:50.739 --> 06:52.910
I had a collection
of old Elvis vinyls

06:52.947 --> 06:54.441
I left here a while back.

06:54.483 --> 06:56.818
My girlfriend,
she's a big Elvis fan.

06:56.851 --> 06:57.898
We thought we'd come by
and, uh,

06:57.939 --> 06:59.019
pick 'em up from you.

06:59.059 --> 07:02.834
Last time I saw you,
you drove off in my car.

07:02.867 --> 07:06.096
Go fuck off
before I call the police.

07:07.859 --> 07:10.445
# Tonight you will be mine #

07:10.483 --> 07:11.563
It's okay.

07:15.668 --> 07:20.402
# Tonight the monkey dies #

07:35.539 --> 07:43.274
# Tonight you will be mine #

07:43.315 --> 07:48.017
# Tonight the monkey dies #

08:09.395 --> 08:12.242
If you're lookin' for
your grandmother, she's gone.

08:12.275 --> 08:15.177
We buried her last winter.

08:29.971 --> 08:33.200
Gonna spend
a few weeks huntin' deer.

08:33.235 --> 08:36.366
Be sure and pour
some of this stuff on ya.

08:36.403 --> 08:37.515
Here.

08:37.554 --> 08:39.082
Thanks.

08:39.123 --> 08:40.780
Wayne?

08:40.818 --> 08:41.832
Yeah?

08:41.875 --> 08:43.631
You lookin'
for another job?

08:43.667 --> 08:44.616
I don't know.

08:44.659 --> 08:45.968
Try my hand
at real estate maybe.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.687
Put you in an office
and a suit.

08:48.723 --> 08:49.901
Ha ha! You bet!

08:57.363 --> 08:59.534
Hey, Lionel.

08:59.571 --> 09:00.815
Where's your cane?

09:03.155 --> 09:05.227
I'm sorry
about your grandmother.

09:05.267 --> 09:08.528
The band office
has been trying to locate

09:08.563 --> 09:09.807
the next of kin

09:09.843 --> 09:11.916
to find out what to do
with her house.

09:11.955 --> 09:13.515
Hey, I been thinking.

09:15.283 --> 09:17.771
When I get paid
for this job I done,

09:17.811 --> 09:19.950
maybe I could fix
the place up.

09:19.987 --> 09:21.776
You could sell it
the way it is.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.600
No, I mean fix it up
and live here.

09:24.723 --> 09:26.479
A guy like you,

09:26.515 --> 09:28.009
used to living
in the city?

09:28.051 --> 09:30.385
There's no life
for you here.

09:30.419 --> 09:35.122
I could always be
a friendly Indian like you,

09:35.155 --> 09:36.497
maybe even a guide.

09:37.683 --> 09:39.309
You wouldn't like it.

09:39.347 --> 09:41.070
Why not? You do.

09:41.107 --> 09:43.246
Hey, Lionel,

09:43.283 --> 09:44.810
come on, you telling me
I can't live here?

09:47.763 --> 09:50.730
Hey, you ever ride
in a Cadillac?

09:50.771 --> 09:52.560
Come on. We'll take a drive.

09:52.595 --> 09:54.505
Go to Algonac,
have some drink.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.805
You go.

09:57.843 --> 09:59.599
I got to go home.

10:17.171 --> 10:17.967
Hey.

10:18.035 --> 10:18.896
Hi.

10:18.963 --> 10:21.549
Didn't let myself in.

10:21.619 --> 10:23.506
Right.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.513
Which is kind of weird.

10:36.787 --> 10:38.380
Well,
I made a start.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.875
I thought I'd leave
the hunting things for you.

10:43.987 --> 10:45.100
Okay.

10:51.891 --> 10:53.484
Well, the guns
I understand,

10:53.523 --> 10:55.694
but why the suit?

10:55.731 --> 10:57.771
You gonna rob a bank?

10:57.811 --> 10:59.534
You mind if I leave
some of this stuff here

10:59.571 --> 11:01.611
till next time?

11:01.651 --> 11:03.756
What's this?

11:03.794 --> 11:04.743
Buck lure.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.584
Oh! God,
that smells like hell.

11:09.619 --> 11:10.895
Not to a buck it don't.

11:13.427 --> 11:15.249
So when is next time?

11:15.283 --> 11:16.559
Tomorrow after work?

11:16.595 --> 11:17.839
Could be
anytime tomorrow.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.762
What happened
to 350 Jefferson?

11:19.795 --> 11:21.486
They want to put me
on a detail gang

11:21.523 --> 11:23.378
on the ground.

11:24.947 --> 11:26.321
I said no.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.643
That's an old man's job.

11:33.171 --> 11:36.618
# It hurts me
to see him treat you #

11:38.131 --> 11:40.978
# The way that he does #

11:41.011 --> 11:46.728
# It hurts me to see you
sit and cry #

11:48.339 --> 11:52.168
# When I know
I could be so true #

11:52.211 --> 11:56.302
# If I had someone like you #

11:56.339 --> 11:59.951
# It hurts me
to see those tears... #

Nelson Davies Realty.

12:01.203 --> 12:02.763
Nelson Davies speaking.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.170
Nelson,
this is Wayne Colson.

12:05.203 --> 12:08.585
# The whole town is talking #

12:08.626 --> 12:12.271
# They're calling you a fool #

12:12.307 --> 12:18.450
# For listening
to his same old lies #

12:18.482 --> 12:23.371
# And when I know
I could be so true #

12:23.411 --> 12:27.404
# If I had someone like you #

12:27.443 --> 12:32.200
# Hurts me to see the way
he makes you cry #

12:36.210 --> 12:38.599
# You love him so much #

Nelson Davies Realty.
Nelson Davies speaking.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.585
Them Tanglewood homes
are goin' fast, huh?

12:45.619 --> 12:47.626
They sure are, sir.
Let me tell you why.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.962
I bet they'd go even
faster if they caught fire.

12:53.203 --> 12:54.282
Who's this?

12:54.323 --> 12:56.232
It can happen anytime.

12:56.274 --> 12:59.373
Pine Ridge was
just a rearrangement.

12:59.410 --> 13:02.280
Just a little wear and tear.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.657
But it could happen again,

13:04.691 --> 13:07.441
or you can pay
so it won't...

13:07.475 --> 13:09.035
like insurance.

13:09.075 --> 13:10.700
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

13:10.739 --> 13:12.429
You get 20,000
cash ready,

13:12.467 --> 13:13.612
and I'll come pick it up
sometime.

13:13.650 --> 13:15.276
You don't have it
when I come to collect,

13:15.314 --> 13:18.348
you're dead. You be ready,
'cause you don't know

13:18.387 --> 13:19.849
when I'm gonna
walk through that door

13:19.891 --> 13:22.379
or which one that comes in
I'm gonna be.

13:22.419 --> 13:24.306
And I'll tell you
somethin' else.

13:24.339 --> 13:26.957
You remember a guy
worked at an Amoco station,

13:26.994 --> 13:28.172
one up in Port Huron?

13:30.322 --> 13:33.104
Got shot dead last year
during a holdup.

13:33.139 --> 13:35.822
I might have read
something about that.

13:35.859 --> 13:37.801
Yeah. Well, that was me.

13:37.843 --> 13:40.047
20,000
when I come to collect,

13:40.082 --> 13:42.417
or you're
a dead real estate man.

13:46.131 --> 13:50.386
Platform 0-3,
1510 to Montreal.

13:50.419 --> 13:56.977
Calling at Oshawa, Belleville,
Kingston, Cornwall, and Dorval.

14:16.275 --> 14:17.519
Yeah?

14:17.555 --> 14:19.082
You owe me some money.

14:19.123 --> 14:20.105
The fuckin' money's

14:20.146 --> 14:21.553
the price
on your fuckin' head,

14:21.587 --> 14:23.048
you piece of shit.

14:23.091 --> 14:25.938
Who the fuck told you
to kill the girl?

14:25.971 --> 14:27.629
She saw my face.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.969
Who cares, she saw
your fuckin' face?!

14:30.002 --> 14:31.213
She worked for me!

14:31.251 --> 14:34.120
You better listen to me,
you half-breed fuckin' moron.

14:34.163 --> 14:35.439
You're dead.
You understand?

14:35.475 --> 14:37.068
I don't care you shoot
your own brother,

14:37.107 --> 14:38.055
you're so drunk.

14:38.099 --> 14:40.171
You touch what's mine,
you're dead.

15:22.835 --> 15:24.296
That's a cool car.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.235
I'm lookin' for a ride.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.965
Well, good luck.

15:30.003 --> 15:34.607
No, you say,
"Which way you goin'?"

15:34.643 --> 15:36.715
and I say, "Any way I want."

15:41.171 --> 15:42.578
Don't worry.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

15:42.610 --> 15:43.821
I just need your car

15:43.859 --> 15:45.004
for a little business
I'm plannin'.

15:45.042 --> 15:47.595
See, usually, I rob banks,

15:47.635 --> 15:51.017
but 2,700's the best
I ever did up in Ohio.

15:51.059 --> 15:53.098
This time I got somethin'
way bigger in mind.

15:56.179 --> 15:57.673
You got Indian blood,
don'tcha?

15:59.571 --> 16:01.393
Enough to own a casino.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.224
You got a cool name?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.552
A cool name?

16:08.595 --> 16:11.977
Yeah, you know,
I mean, "Red Elk"

16:12.018 --> 16:14.669
or "Running with the Wolves"?

16:15.923 --> 16:17.329
Blackbird.

16:17.362 --> 16:18.639
Blackbird?

16:20.818 --> 16:23.185
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

16:23.219 --> 16:26.929
Well, my name's Richie Nix,
in case you ever heard of me.

16:26.962 --> 16:28.937
It's N-I-X.

16:28.979 --> 16:31.662
It's not the way
Stevie Nicks spells hers.

16:36.626 --> 16:37.804
Turn left up here.

16:50.258 --> 16:51.207
All right.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.844
Now let me have
your wallet.

16:54.899 --> 16:56.906
Hey! What the hell
you think you're doin'?

16:58.483 --> 17:00.938
You wanted my wallet.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.986
Yeah. Nice and slow.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.204
What's L and M Distributing?

17:12.242 --> 17:15.176
A company
I used to work for.

17:15.218 --> 17:17.007
Uh, what do they distribute?

17:17.041 --> 17:19.082
Pepperoni.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.489
Pepperoni company
gives you a Cadillac to drive?

17:21.522 --> 17:23.214
What the fuck
you do for them?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.704
I shoot people.

17:25.746 --> 17:29.292
Sometime for money,
sometime for nothing.

17:36.627 --> 17:38.601
And then I told him
about this Amoco station

17:38.643 --> 17:39.919
I held up a while back.

17:39.955 --> 17:42.922
One up in Port Huron.
You might have heard about it.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.832
I told him I ended up havin'
to blow a guy away up there,

17:45.875 --> 17:48.264
so now he's scared.
That's when I hit him with it.

17:48.307 --> 17:51.373
20,000 cash,
or you're fuckin' dead.

17:51.410 --> 17:53.614
I could hear the phone
shakin' in his hands.

17:57.362 --> 17:59.599
Yeah, scare a guy enough,
he'll pay every time.

18:00.627 --> 18:03.048
A man's scared
don't always do what you expect.

18:03.091 --> 18:04.170
Yeah, but...

18:04.211 --> 18:06.283
You don't
want to talk too much,

18:06.322 --> 18:08.145
let him know
what you're thinking.

18:08.178 --> 18:11.855
You want to take him
by surprise.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.509
You have something to wear,
suit or something?

18:14.546 --> 18:15.888
You want to look the part.

18:15.922 --> 18:18.257
See? Now, that's why I need
a fuckin' partner, man.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.586
I mean it. I have no patience
for details like that.

18:21.618 --> 18:24.967
You ever work
with anyone before?

18:25.010 --> 18:26.701
My brothers.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.593
One is in prison forever...

18:29.619 --> 18:32.106
and my kid brother is dead.

18:33.394 --> 18:35.467
You remind me of him.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.385
He was a stupid guy.

18:41.842 --> 18:44.592
So, uh, Blackbird...

18:45.714 --> 18:47.569
how's 10,000 sound?

18:47.602 --> 18:49.391
Bird.

18:49.427 --> 18:51.052
Bird?

18:51.090 --> 18:53.873
That's what my kid brother
used to call me.

18:55.091 --> 18:57.033
All right, Bird.

18:57.074 --> 18:58.121
We got a deal?

19:24.243 --> 19:26.544
Welcome
to Nelson Davies Realty,

19:26.579 --> 19:29.328
the number one agency
in the Anchor Bay area,

19:29.362 --> 19:32.678
serving the whole community
with expertise and integrity

19:32.722 --> 19:34.827
for over 15 years.

20:06.418 --> 20:07.695
I told you
you wouldn't know

20:07.730 --> 20:10.414
which one I'm gonna be
when I came in. Remember?

20:11.762 --> 20:13.006
What?

20:13.042 --> 20:15.017
On the phone.

20:15.058 --> 20:16.684
I think you want to talk
to somebody downstairs.

20:16.722 --> 20:18.129
They'll help you out.

20:18.163 --> 20:20.334
You see that?
He's playin' dumb.

20:20.370 --> 20:22.029
Yeah, he's fucking with you.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.921
You gonna try and tell me
I never spoke to you?

20:23.954 --> 20:25.034
Huh?

20:25.074 --> 20:27.889
No. I think
he said he don't believe

20:27.922 --> 20:29.994
what you told him
on the telephone.

20:30.035 --> 20:31.529
Show him you mean it.

20:52.467 --> 20:53.873
Am I makin' my point?

20:53.906 --> 20:54.855
Give me the cash,

20:54.899 --> 20:56.721
or you're a dead
fuckin' real estate man.

20:56.754 --> 20:58.696
Okay, you win.

20:58.739 --> 21:01.456
It's downstairs in the car.

21:02.675 --> 21:05.424
Welcome
to Nelson Davies Realty,

21:05.459 --> 21:08.459
the number one agency
in the Anchor Bay area,

21:08.498 --> 21:11.345
serving the whole community
with expertise and integrity

21:11.378 --> 21:13.833
for more than 15 years.

21:16.019 --> 21:17.807
You own this business,
you still drive a pickup?

21:17.842 --> 21:20.525
I like to think success
hasn't changed me.

21:21.490 --> 21:23.116
Wayne?

21:23.154 --> 21:24.496
Who the fuck
is Wayne?

21:24.530 --> 21:26.057
Beats me.

21:27.891 --> 21:29.385
Hey, let's go.

21:29.426 --> 21:30.670
Wayne?

21:30.706 --> 21:31.688
What's goin' on here?

21:31.731 --> 21:33.934
Hey, forget it.
Let's get out.

21:33.970 --> 21:35.214
No. Give it to me.

21:45.682 --> 21:47.307
Lock the door. Call the cops.

22:12.466 --> 22:14.124
Aah!

22:24.850 --> 22:26.377
Hey!

22:32.211 --> 22:33.640
Hey!

22:36.307 --> 22:39.470
Bird!

22:53.810 --> 22:55.054
Fuck!

23:01.938 --> 23:02.636
For a job.

23:03.058 --> 23:06.157
I said Nelson knew
I was comin' by.

23:06.194 --> 23:07.274
It was hardly an appointment.

23:07.314 --> 23:08.808
His wife's an employee,

23:08.850 --> 23:10.344
and there was some talk
about Wayne dropping by.

23:10.386 --> 23:11.695
Hence, the suit.

23:11.730 --> 23:12.678
But you're an ironworker.

23:12.722 --> 23:14.283
Hence, the boots.

23:14.322 --> 23:16.744
I'm lookin'
at other things, okay?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.760
It's just an odd time
to appear, that's all.

23:18.802 --> 23:20.209
Lunch. There's nobody here.

23:20.242 --> 23:21.452
I was here.

23:21.490 --> 23:23.465
Because I'm gonna be
making some claims, all right?

23:23.506 --> 23:25.099
The window damages...

23:25.138 --> 23:26.600
And you didn't know
these guys?

23:26.642 --> 23:27.787
No, sir.

23:27.826 --> 23:30.281
'Cause nobody witnessed
you arriving separately.

23:30.322 --> 23:32.264
Wait just a minute.

23:32.306 --> 23:33.648
They shot at my husband.

23:33.682 --> 23:35.406
He probably saved my life.

23:35.442 --> 23:38.192
Mr. Colson, you knew nothing
about these blackmail calls?

23:38.226 --> 23:40.113
Hey, I don't know
about any calls.

23:40.146 --> 23:41.128
What blackmail calls?

23:42.899 --> 23:45.615
There were some calls
last week. Uh, creeps.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.690
I told the police.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.224
But not us?

23:49.267 --> 23:51.754
Those creeps
had guns, Nelson.

23:51.794 --> 23:52.971
Asshole.

23:53.010 --> 23:54.122
Wayne.

23:55.218 --> 23:56.495
Asshole.

24:01.586 --> 24:03.626
I'm bleedin'
somethin' fierce here, man.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.706
Let's just go to Marine City.
I want to see Donna.

24:05.746 --> 24:07.502
Who the fuck is Donna?

24:07.538 --> 24:09.164
She's this woman
that I'm stayin' with.

24:09.202 --> 24:11.275
She's cool, man.
I told her about you.

24:11.314 --> 24:13.965
It's on the way
to Port Huron.

24:14.002 --> 24:16.107
My brothers and I
come up here one time

24:16.147 --> 24:17.292
to kill a guy.

24:17.330 --> 24:20.330
No shit. What'd he do?

24:20.370 --> 24:21.647
I didn't ask.

24:23.794 --> 24:26.761
That doesn't
make sense to me.

24:26.802 --> 24:29.519
I gotta be pissed at a guy
I want to kill him.

24:30.866 --> 24:32.491
Bird, why didn't you shoot him?

24:32.530 --> 24:34.504
He was standin' right there
in the fuckin' window.

24:34.546 --> 24:36.072
You want to learn somethin'?

24:36.114 --> 24:38.503
The only time
you ever take out your gun

24:38.546 --> 24:40.007
is when you're gonna
kill somebody.

24:40.050 --> 24:41.904
Yeah? Well,
you could've right there!

24:41.938 --> 24:43.825
It's the same as a hunter.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.549
The guy who knows
what he's doing,

24:45.586 --> 24:49.416
he don't take the shot
if he thinks he can miss.

24:49.458 --> 24:52.807
See, then you gotta find
the animal and finish it,

24:52.850 --> 24:53.962
two of them.

24:55.346 --> 24:56.655
Are you talkin'
about the woman now?

24:56.690 --> 24:58.697
What'd that woman do?

24:58.738 --> 25:01.194
She saw my face.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.143
You don't
ever leave things undone.

25:03.186 --> 25:04.201
You don't ever think

25:04.242 --> 25:06.446
somebody's not going
to remember you.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.814
Some people were askin'
after you this mornin'.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.443
What people?

25:22.482 --> 25:26.127
Said they were friends
of yours from Toronto.

25:26.162 --> 25:28.333
What'd you tell them?

25:28.370 --> 25:31.686
I told them
I hadn't seen you in years.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.578
You see
my friend's face, Lionel?

25:34.610 --> 25:36.269
Fell off a ladder.

25:36.306 --> 25:38.193
Got cut up,
couldn't go to work.

25:38.226 --> 25:41.575
So I said, "Hey,
let's go duck hunting."

25:41.618 --> 25:43.244
You free to take us?

25:44.818 --> 25:47.688
Weather's supposed to turn.

25:47.730 --> 25:49.934
Why don't we go anyway?

25:49.970 --> 25:52.075
Richie's never seen
a marsh before.

25:52.114 --> 25:53.575
I've seen a marsh.

25:57.746 --> 25:59.273
Come on, Lionel.

26:01.202 --> 26:02.663
This won't take long.

26:22.194 --> 26:23.721
You okay?

26:23.762 --> 26:26.250
I... guess so.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.395
That Indian guy freaked me out.

26:28.434 --> 26:29.644
Walk you in?

26:31.538 --> 26:33.000
So what things
are you looking at?

26:33.042 --> 26:34.024
Huh?

26:34.066 --> 26:35.081
Back there with the police,

26:35.122 --> 26:37.293
you said you were
looking at other things?

26:37.330 --> 26:40.177
Yeah, well,
I'm lookin' at anything.

26:40.210 --> 26:42.032
You said it.
I'm a dinosaur.

26:42.066 --> 26:43.627
I gotta change or die.

26:43.666 --> 26:45.226
I never said that.

26:45.266 --> 26:47.153
Then I'm sayin' it.

26:47.186 --> 26:49.607
So today's the day
you decide to come in

26:49.649 --> 26:50.926
about a job in real estate?

26:52.050 --> 26:53.294
What? I could sell a house.

26:53.330 --> 26:55.534
Absolutely.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.220
Anyway, thank God
you showed up in that suit.

26:58.258 --> 27:00.560
Yeah, dangerous suit.

27:00.594 --> 27:02.449
Got married in it,
got shot at in it.

27:02.481 --> 27:04.816
Well, you look great in it.

27:06.514 --> 27:08.685
Anyway, thanks.

27:10.002 --> 27:11.082
Anytime.

27:16.881 --> 27:17.830
Wayne?

27:21.714 --> 27:23.241
It's a deer.

27:23.282 --> 27:25.486
Get some rest.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.140
You need anything,
just call the Hillcrest Motel.

27:37.170 --> 27:39.177
I don't see any birds.

27:39.217 --> 27:40.941
You want to hunt ducks?

27:40.978 --> 27:43.150
You watch the sky.

27:45.778 --> 27:48.812
It looks different,
all this water.

27:48.850 --> 27:50.825
Maybe you never
came down this far,

27:50.866 --> 27:52.622
you and your brothers.

27:52.657 --> 27:56.040
There are no cats or dogs
around here to shoot.

27:57.938 --> 28:01.004
Last time I saw you,
you were going hunting

28:01.041 --> 28:05.165
with some guy
in a ironworker's jacket.

28:05.202 --> 28:07.503
Seemed like a nice guy.

28:07.538 --> 28:09.480
What was his name?

28:10.738 --> 28:11.818
Carl.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.800
Wayne.

28:13.842 --> 28:15.532
You can't remember the rest,

28:15.570 --> 28:18.287
we'll go back and ask
your wife and daughter.

28:22.098 --> 28:23.724
Wayne Colson.

28:23.762 --> 28:25.136
Where does he live?

28:26.098 --> 28:27.440
Algonac.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.132
Is he married?

28:31.090 --> 28:32.781
Kids?

28:32.818 --> 28:33.931
They couldn't.

28:33.970 --> 28:35.857
Hey, there's some!

28:40.882 --> 28:44.427
Looks like you're gonna
have trouble with this one.

28:44.466 --> 28:46.375
He might shoot
the wrong bird.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.160
What's that supposed to mean?

28:51.090 --> 28:53.479
Ducks don't land in trees.

28:56.690 --> 28:59.723
Why don't we go over there,
stretch our legs?

29:27.506 --> 29:28.815
Want to go first?

30:06.353 --> 30:08.012
You know,
you really piss me off!

30:10.386 --> 30:12.361
Tell me ducks
don't land in trees?

30:12.402 --> 30:14.060
Aah!

30:14.098 --> 30:15.952
I know ducks
don't land in trees.

30:31.057 --> 30:32.879
Bird, you comin'?

30:51.217 --> 30:52.297
Excuse me.

30:54.801 --> 30:56.230
Uh...

30:56.273 --> 30:57.702
This is my house.

31:00.082 --> 31:01.511
Uh, yeah.

31:01.554 --> 31:04.107
It's a dump.

31:04.146 --> 31:05.837
You certainly have
your nerve.

31:06.929 --> 31:08.456
Donna... ahem.

31:08.497 --> 31:12.075
Donna, this is the Bird.

31:12.114 --> 31:13.902
He's gonna be stayin'
with us for a few days.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.182
What happened to your face?

31:15.217 --> 31:16.875
I got in a fight.

31:16.914 --> 31:19.248
We got any beers?

31:19.282 --> 31:21.518
Well, why don't you fix us
somethin' to eat,

31:21.554 --> 31:22.568
and I'll go get some.

31:27.026 --> 31:30.670
Hey, don't call me
Bird no more.

31:30.706 --> 31:32.113
Why?

31:32.145 --> 31:33.487
What do you
want me to call you?

31:34.738 --> 31:36.331
My name.

31:36.370 --> 31:37.646
Armand.

31:37.682 --> 31:40.103
Ar-mand? Armand?

31:40.146 --> 31:42.317
Are you serious?

31:45.522 --> 31:46.896
Listen...

31:49.233 --> 31:50.859
when she's makin'
all that fuckin' noise in there,

31:50.897 --> 31:52.304
it means she's pissed off.

31:52.338 --> 31:54.225
Why don't you go in there,

31:54.258 --> 31:55.752
give her a little pat
on the ass, huh?

32:11.953 --> 32:14.342
You want the Weight Watchers
chicken patty or the regular?

32:14.385 --> 32:17.768
Mmm...
two Weight Watchers, please.

32:20.753 --> 32:23.503
Richie said you used to be
a hack in the joint.

32:24.753 --> 32:26.761
That how you met?

32:26.802 --> 32:28.941
I was in catering services.

32:28.978 --> 32:32.011
Said you got fired
for screwin' the inmates.

32:35.986 --> 32:37.709
You drive
that school bus out there?

32:43.218 --> 32:45.706
Hey, if you could be
any kind of a bird there is...

32:46.833 --> 32:48.688
what kind of bird would you be?

32:52.433 --> 32:54.255
What are you doing here?

32:57.041 --> 32:59.016
Just need a place to stay.

32:59.057 --> 33:00.170
For how long?

33:01.873 --> 33:03.051
Couple of days.

33:03.089 --> 33:04.845
Got some business
to take care of.

33:05.810 --> 33:08.231
You want some bacon
with your chicken patties?

33:41.137 --> 33:42.217
Thanks.

33:42.257 --> 33:43.818
Sure.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

33:43.858 --> 33:47.403
I was busy, but, uh...

33:49.010 --> 33:52.272
Well, I dragged myself away
from starin' at the ceiling.

33:52.305 --> 33:54.891
Well, anyway,
it turned out to be nothing.

33:54.929 --> 33:56.839
I'm so jumpy. I'm sorry.

33:56.882 --> 33:58.256
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

33:58.290 --> 33:59.435
No, no. Go to bed.

33:59.473 --> 34:01.196
I'll grab a beer,
at least till you're asleep.

34:01.234 --> 34:02.543
Well, there's really no need.

34:02.577 --> 34:06.855
Oh. Well, now you're not
scared, I can't have a beer.

34:06.898 --> 34:08.425
Wayne, you shouldn't really
even have keys to the house.

34:08.466 --> 34:11.083
I'm confused,
'cause for a second there,

34:11.121 --> 34:12.780
I thought you called me.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.159
I did call you,
and I am nervous,

34:14.193 --> 34:16.527
but if you can just let yourself
in whenever you want...

34:16.561 --> 34:17.489
Which I've never done.

34:17.521 --> 34:18.601
But you could.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.878
I don't know.
I know you've been here.

34:20.913 --> 34:21.895
Yeah, but not when you were here.

34:21.938 --> 34:23.563
So you <i>have been here.</i>

34:23.601 --> 34:25.007
I fixed the porch light.

34:25.041 --> 34:26.896
Carmen, I waited
till you'd gone out

34:26.929 --> 34:28.620
so as not to get into a fight.

34:28.658 --> 34:29.900
Which means
you were watching me,

34:29.938 --> 34:31.880
which might be why I'm
feeling watched all the time.

34:31.920 --> 34:32.849
Come on!

34:32.880 --> 34:34.059
All right, you know what?

34:34.097 --> 34:36.301
I'm thankful to you
for fixing the porch light.

34:36.338 --> 34:37.831
Yeah, and that faucet
in the bathroom.

34:37.873 --> 34:39.335
And the faucet
in the bathroom, too.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.320
But this was supposed
to be a change.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.216
Nothing's changing.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.864
Wayne, I'm moving.

34:48.496 --> 34:50.601
I don't like
being this person

34:50.641 --> 34:53.260
who's blaming you for all
the things I'm blaming you for.

34:54.386 --> 34:58.128
You know, there's no, uh...
middle, huh?

34:58.161 --> 35:00.333
I mean, this is it with you.

35:00.369 --> 35:01.482
You're either fine,

35:01.521 --> 35:02.765
or you are leavin'
the country.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.168
We don't have kids, fine.

35:05.202 --> 35:06.795
We can't have kids, fine.

35:06.833 --> 35:09.703
No, suddenly,
we are killin' ourselves.

35:09.746 --> 35:11.207
We are gettin' a divorce.

35:11.249 --> 35:12.908
We are leavin' the country.

35:12.945 --> 35:16.491
I mean,
it's like it's zero or ten.

35:16.529 --> 35:18.700
I mean, what happened to five?

35:18.738 --> 35:20.876
Five's pretty great.

35:20.914 --> 35:22.888
I'll take five again
in a fuckin' minute.

35:25.745 --> 35:26.923
See?
What I tell you?

35:26.961 --> 35:29.001
He's fuckin' that woman
from the real estate office.

35:50.545 --> 35:51.473
I got him!

35:51.505 --> 35:52.749
You get the woman!

36:02.929 --> 36:03.857
Hello.

36:03.889 --> 36:05.296
- It's me.
- Mom.

36:12.977 --> 36:15.017
Oh, ask me something else.

36:15.057 --> 36:16.967
How are you? How are you?

36:21.425 --> 36:22.603
Oh, he's out. He'll be back.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.983
You know,
I went to see

36:24.018 --> 36:25.741
that doctor again
this afternoon.

36:25.777 --> 36:27.817
I told him those pills
don't agree with me at all.

36:27.858 --> 36:30.224
Hey, Mom,
I have to call you back.

36:49.105 --> 36:50.534
You going hunting, miss?

36:53.105 --> 36:54.414
I was looking
for your husband,

36:54.449 --> 36:55.594
have a talk with him.

36:55.633 --> 36:56.615
He's not home.

36:58.193 --> 36:59.469
I know that.

36:59.505 --> 37:01.894
I was wondering maybe
I'd come inside and wait.

37:03.601 --> 37:07.049
We met before, remember?
At the real estate office.

37:12.817 --> 37:14.890
You going to shoot me?

37:17.009 --> 37:18.668
The police should be here
any minute.

37:18.705 --> 37:21.007
Oh, you had time
to call them, huh?

37:23.633 --> 37:25.673
I don't think
you're going to shoot me.

37:42.513 --> 37:43.528
Hi.

37:53.745 --> 37:54.858
Ohh!

37:54.897 --> 37:57.679
All right!
It's your big day, honey!

37:57.713 --> 37:58.891
It's a double feature!

37:58.929 --> 38:00.816
Get out the cash tray,
lay it on the counter.

38:00.849 --> 38:03.304
And some gum.
Make that bubblegum.

38:03.345 --> 38:04.425
Do it!

38:12.306 --> 38:13.899
Get out of there!

38:13.937 --> 38:14.885
Get the hell
out of there!

38:42.481 --> 38:43.725
Fuck!

38:59.857 --> 39:01.002
Fuck.

39:16.945 --> 39:18.057
Get up.

39:23.921 --> 39:25.776
Are you Indian?

39:27.538 --> 39:28.715
You look Indian.

39:28.753 --> 39:30.476
You know, you should do
somethin' with your hair.

39:30.513 --> 39:32.652
Use a shampoo
with conditioner in one.

39:32.690 --> 39:34.729
Give it some body.

39:34.769 --> 39:35.717
Look at me.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.045
Are you sure
you're not Indian?

39:41.905 --> 39:44.588
Oh, well, doesn't matter.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.357
How many times
are you gonna ask me,

39:49.393 --> 39:51.281
"Did I see him
shoot the girl?"

39:52.657 --> 39:56.202
I thought she'd gotten
out of there!

39:57.713 --> 39:58.280
How many times
are you gonna go

39:58.673 --> 40:01.291
look at that bullet hole
in the tree?

40:01.329 --> 40:04.144
My wife told you that she
wasn't tryin' to hit him,

40:04.177 --> 40:05.965
and you guys act like
you don't believe her!

40:06.001 --> 40:08.652
Not one of you guys
has said, "Nice goin',"

40:08.689 --> 40:10.828
or that was brave thing
my wife did!

40:11.857 --> 40:13.799
These maniacs
are tryin' to kill us,

40:13.841 --> 40:15.368
and what are you
doin' about it?

40:16.465 --> 40:17.643
Mr. Colson?

40:17.681 --> 40:18.826
Mrs. Colson.

40:18.865 --> 40:22.094
I'm Paul Scallen,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

40:23.281 --> 40:24.688
That's the same color
as the guy's car.

40:24.721 --> 40:27.471
A big goddamn Cadillac
nobody can seem to find.

40:27.505 --> 40:29.993
Oh, we found it
on Walpole Island.

40:30.033 --> 40:32.139
Only there wasn't
a lot of paintwork left.

40:32.177 --> 40:35.243
Mr. Colson, do you know
a Lionel Adam?

40:36.306 --> 40:38.029
Yeah, sure.

40:38.065 --> 40:39.821
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

40:43.313 --> 40:45.899
Would you mind telling us who
the hell these assholes are now

40:45.937 --> 40:48.239
and why would they want
to kill Lionel Adam?

40:48.273 --> 40:49.680
We don't know for sure.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.982
We think they were
trying to find you.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.927
It seems you and your wife
had a good look at them.

40:53.969 --> 40:55.595
So what?

40:55.633 --> 40:57.095
All they were doin'
at that point

40:57.137 --> 40:59.177
was shakin' down
a real estate business.

40:59.217 --> 41:01.322
This one maybe, but...

41:01.361 --> 41:02.605
this one's
got more of a history.

41:02.641 --> 41:04.135
His name's Armand Degas.

41:04.177 --> 41:05.803
He's known as The Blackbird.

41:05.841 --> 41:09.005
He's a contract killer
for the Toronto Mafia.

41:09.041 --> 41:11.180
Takes an awful lot of nerve
to stand up to a man like that.

41:11.217 --> 41:13.705
What does the Toronto Mafia
have to do with us?

41:13.745 --> 41:14.793
Last week,
the head of the family

41:14.833 --> 41:16.459
was shot dead
in a Detroit hotel room,

41:16.497 --> 41:18.985
along with a girl
who might have seen it happen.

41:19.025 --> 41:20.585
We think it was an inside job.

41:20.625 --> 41:21.770
And thanks to you,

41:21.809 --> 41:24.591
we know that Degas
was in the area at the time.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.697
So if we can, uh,
pick him up,

41:26.737 --> 41:27.914
even if it's
just for extortion,

41:27.953 --> 41:29.807
there's a chance that
he may want to cut a deal.

41:29.841 --> 41:31.368
Wait.

41:31.409 --> 41:34.311
You want us to testify
against a Mafia hitman?

41:34.353 --> 41:37.255
He's gonna come
after you either way.

41:38.609 --> 41:41.129
Without you, there's nothing
to say he was even here.

41:41.169 --> 41:42.958
So what do you suggest?

41:44.273 --> 41:45.353
Well, your lives
are in danger,

41:45.393 --> 41:47.564
so we figure you qualify
for federal protection

41:47.601 --> 41:49.095
under the Witness
Security Program.

41:53.265 --> 41:55.632
You want to move us
someplace else?

41:55.665 --> 41:57.127
Until we find them.

41:57.169 --> 41:59.308
We'll provide you
with new identities,

41:59.345 --> 42:01.167
temporary employment.

42:01.201 --> 42:03.535
You won't need
to sell the house.

42:03.569 --> 42:05.423
I'm sure we can make a deal
with this Nelson Davies,

42:05.457 --> 42:07.562
have his company appear
to offer it for sale.

42:27.665 --> 42:28.811
Yeah?

42:28.849 --> 42:29.797
It's me.

42:29.841 --> 42:33.288
Why the fuck
are you callin' me here?

42:33.329 --> 42:34.277
I need a car.

42:34.321 --> 42:36.077
A clean one with papers.

42:36.113 --> 42:38.284
Word is,
you really upset the man.

42:38.321 --> 42:40.263
He was fuckin' that girl
you blew away.

42:40.305 --> 42:42.214
Can you arrange it or not?

42:42.257 --> 42:44.264
You can't come here.

42:44.305 --> 42:46.345
They got everyone
lookin' for you.

42:52.561 --> 42:54.568
We'll transfer
your baggage overnight.

42:54.609 --> 42:57.391
Replacement vehicles will be
waiting for you in the morning.

42:57.425 --> 42:58.473
Your own will be held

42:58.513 --> 43:00.007
until you're released
from the program.

43:00.049 --> 43:01.544
Never hear about that,
do you?

43:01.585 --> 43:03.145
People gettin'
out of witness protection?

43:03.185 --> 43:05.935
Destination location
is Cape Girardeau.

43:05.969 --> 43:07.463
That's about
another 2-hour drive

43:07.505 --> 43:09.196
south down the Mississippi River.

43:09.233 --> 43:12.103
Now, you'll be checking in here
under your new names.

43:15.441 --> 43:17.328
You must be Pam Benkowski.

43:19.217 --> 43:21.453
I'm your husband Matt.

43:38.225 --> 43:39.686
It's best to stick

43:39.729 --> 43:41.289
as close
to the truth as possible.

43:41.329 --> 43:42.890
That way, you're less
likely to have trouble

43:42.929 --> 43:44.139
with your invented histories.

43:45.969 --> 43:48.140
How long you been married?

43:48.177 --> 43:49.104
15 years.

43:49.137 --> 43:50.511
Where'd you meet?

43:50.545 --> 43:52.399
On a building site
in Saint Auburn.

43:52.433 --> 43:55.215
June 4, 1991.

43:55.249 --> 43:56.656
Who asked who out first?

43:56.689 --> 43:57.737
I did.

43:57.777 --> 44:00.013
How long after that
were you married?

44:00.049 --> 44:01.031
A week.

44:01.073 --> 44:02.829
How many children?

44:04.657 --> 44:06.217
Almost one.

44:11.505 --> 44:12.617
Well, if they moved,

44:12.657 --> 44:14.184
how come all their furniture's
still here?

44:19.089 --> 44:20.779
Hey, Bird.

44:20.817 --> 44:22.344
What?

44:23.313 --> 44:25.135
You gonna kill Donna, too?

44:28.305 --> 44:29.515
I mean, you're goin'
to all this trouble

44:29.553 --> 44:31.495
findin' witnesses,
and she's a witness.

44:31.537 --> 44:33.326
What does that make you?

44:34.640 --> 44:36.713
No, you need me.

44:36.753 --> 44:39.404
Leave my fingerprints
everywhere.

44:39.440 --> 44:40.869
Steal cars and shoot people,

44:40.913 --> 44:41.861
do all your dirty work
for you.

44:54.897 --> 44:56.359
Who is it?

44:56.401 --> 44:59.750
Uh, yes, ma'am,
I'm looking for Wayne Colson.

44:59.793 --> 45:02.510
Who gave you my number?

45:02.545 --> 45:03.690
Excuse me, ma'am.

45:03.729 --> 45:05.071
That was a new fella
works here

45:05.105 --> 45:06.185
I just asked to call you.

45:06.224 --> 45:07.980
We been tryin'
to get ahold of Wayne,

45:08.017 --> 45:10.505
and, uh, he gave us
this number before he left.

45:10.545 --> 45:12.912
He gave you my number?

45:12.944 --> 45:15.432
Well, as a matter of fact,
he gave it to the boss.

45:15.472 --> 45:16.716
Boss gave it to me.

45:16.753 --> 45:18.760
Only he isn't here right now
'cause it's so late,

45:18.800 --> 45:21.550
but, uh, he said that
you'd know where he was.

45:21.584 --> 45:22.730
Wayne, that is.

45:22.769 --> 45:24.492
I don't know
where they've gone.

45:24.529 --> 45:26.416
Wayne and my daughter
never tell me anything.

45:26.449 --> 45:29.710
See, 'cause I got this
check I'm tryin' to send him.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.109
Yeah. Yes.

45:47.569 --> 45:49.391
Mr. Benkowski.

45:49.424 --> 45:52.174
Mrs. Benkowski.
Good morning. Welcome.

45:52.209 --> 45:53.136
- Morning.
- Hello.

45:53.169 --> 45:54.314
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:54.353 --> 45:55.662
Shall we?

45:55.697 --> 46:00.748
If the neighbors ask,
you paid about $200,000 for it.

46:00.785 --> 46:03.469
It looks more
like 150 to me.

46:32.624 --> 46:37.032
# The best I can #

46:37.072 --> 46:40.967
# But it's not good #

46:41.008 --> 46:43.594
# Enough for you #

46:45.393 --> 46:50.379
# You know I was
the kind who'd run #

46:50.416 --> 46:53.199
# Anytime you'd call #

46:53.232 --> 46:57.160
# I guess I was the only one #

46:57.201 --> 47:00.332
# Who didn't mind at all #

47:00.368 --> 47:02.824
# I'll be your dreamer #

47:03.952 --> 47:07.913
# I'll be your fool #

47:07.953 --> 47:11.815
# Oh, my darling #

47:11.857 --> 47:15.818
# My whole life through #

47:15.857 --> 47:19.632
# Doing the best #

47:19.664 --> 47:22.763
# The best I can #

47:23.985 --> 47:25.261
# But it's not good #

47:25.297 --> 47:27.817
Sure ain't much privacy
around here.

47:27.856 --> 47:29.002
# Enough for you... #

47:29.041 --> 47:34.126
You want privacy,
you close the door.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.102
But I don't think
that's what you want.

47:37.648 --> 47:40.332
Well, I guess you're gonna do
whatever it is you want.

47:44.368 --> 47:46.790
There's no way on earth
I can stop you.

48:06.385 --> 48:09.320
There'll be a slight delay
in the divorce proceedings

48:09.361 --> 48:11.368
while the couple hides out
from the killers.

48:13.969 --> 48:15.049
Good night.

48:15.088 --> 48:16.943
# Every time you kiss me #

48:16.977 --> 48:21.417
# I'm still not certain
that you love me #

48:21.456 --> 48:24.424
This is Elvis Presley
Boulevard on a rainy day.

48:24.465 --> 48:27.312
This is the <i>Lisa Marie.</i>

48:27.345 --> 48:28.359
It's a jetliner he bought.

48:28.401 --> 48:30.343
He named it
after his daughter.

48:30.385 --> 48:32.141
Her and I have
the same birthday.

48:32.176 --> 48:34.762
And I'll tell ya
somethin' else.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.655
My life number is 9.

48:36.689 --> 48:37.933
What's a life number?

48:37.969 --> 48:42.192
Okay, well, you add up
your date of birth, right?

48:42.224 --> 48:44.810
Um, like February's
the second month, so that's 2.

48:44.848 --> 48:48.776
I was born on the first.
That's 1, so 2 and 1 is 3.

48:48.817 --> 48:50.475
Then you add in the year
that you were born.

48:50.512 --> 48:52.814
I'm not gonna tell you
when that was,

48:52.848 --> 48:54.703
but my number
comes out to 9.

48:54.737 --> 48:56.362
Even if you were born in 1900,

48:56.401 --> 48:58.856
that'd still add up to 10.

48:58.896 --> 49:01.067
Yeah, see, 10 counts as 1.

49:01.105 --> 49:04.204
Donna, get dressed,
go buy some fuckin' beers.

49:04.241 --> 49:05.997
Think he cares
about your queer photos?

49:06.032 --> 49:07.821
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous of what?

49:07.857 --> 49:09.744
You know what the difference
between me and Elvis is?

49:09.777 --> 49:11.303
Yeah. You're ignorant.

49:11.345 --> 49:13.483
No. I'm alive,
and he's dead.

49:13.521 --> 49:15.430
Well, I got news for you.

49:15.472 --> 49:17.261
After you die,
you think anybody's

49:17.296 --> 49:18.922
gonna go and visit your grave?

49:18.960 --> 49:22.059
Not even your mama,
if you had one.

49:22.096 --> 49:23.623
But a hundred years from now,

49:23.664 --> 49:25.803
people will still be going
to Graceland.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.775
Donna,
you're so goddamn stupid.

49:28.816 --> 49:31.566
Let me ask you
a question, Donna.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.226
Would you rather
have Elvis sing to you

49:33.264 --> 49:34.246
or fuck you?

49:34.289 --> 49:36.907
I know what you think
I'm gonna say,

49:36.944 --> 49:38.188
and you'll probably
call me a liar,

49:38.225 --> 49:40.396
but I'd rather
have him sing to me.

49:40.432 --> 49:42.767
Damn. You know what?
I believe her, though.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.262
'cause Elvis
wasn't no con.

49:44.305 --> 49:46.694
He wouldn't have been dirty
or smelly enough for Donna.

49:46.737 --> 49:49.420
Hey, leave her alone.

49:49.457 --> 49:50.918
Who, Donna?

49:50.961 --> 49:54.343
Why don't you
shut the fuck up for a while?

49:56.881 --> 49:59.019
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

49:59.057 --> 50:00.551
Yeah?

50:00.592 --> 50:02.021
What?

50:03.216 --> 50:05.605
This is
Elvis' billiard room.

50:05.648 --> 50:07.852
There's 750 yards of material...

50:07.889 --> 50:10.027
Can I have a word... Armand?

50:13.617 --> 50:16.617
What the fuck
is your problem?!

50:16.656 --> 50:17.605
You are.

50:18.609 --> 50:22.438
And from now on, you don't
leave my fucking sight.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.335
Well, how about
when I go to the bathroom?

50:24.369 --> 50:25.296
You wanna watch?

50:25.329 --> 50:26.474
Or when I'm givin'
Donna a jump

50:26.512 --> 50:27.974
and you're out there,
wishin' it was you.

50:28.017 --> 50:30.864
Or do we keep pretendin' that
you're not tryin' to fuck her?

50:34.577 --> 50:37.708
Hey, you listen to me.

50:39.569 --> 50:42.187
Keep your big
fucking mouth shut,

50:42.224 --> 50:44.166
and don't worry about it.

50:45.968 --> 50:47.343
So you're a welder, huh?

50:47.376 --> 50:49.645
You bet I am.
AWS certified.

50:49.681 --> 50:51.568
Can you weld plates
watertight?

50:51.601 --> 50:55.310
Well, I can weld a goddamn
building so it won't fall down.

50:55.345 --> 50:57.930
I got a job you might
want to take a look at.

51:03.569 --> 51:04.648
Hey.

51:04.689 --> 51:08.005
Maybe today she can't
tell us where they are.

51:08.048 --> 51:11.015
But tomorrow, she might.

51:27.825 --> 51:30.923
What job were
you and Wayne working on?

51:32.752 --> 51:34.825
Well, we've been
on different ones.

51:34.865 --> 51:36.556
Anyway, what I started
to tell you,

51:36.592 --> 51:39.112
I don't see what difference
it makes who mails the check,

51:39.153 --> 51:42.666
you or us, but the boss says
we have to do it.

51:42.704 --> 51:44.614
Now, I told him you were
a nice lady to offer...

51:44.657 --> 51:46.828
And I told you,
I don't have their address.

51:46.864 --> 51:47.944
She never gave it to me.

51:47.985 --> 51:49.839
The only thing I have
is their phone number.

51:49.872 --> 51:51.595
You want that?

51:51.633 --> 51:54.764
Oh. Well, you didn't
mention that, did you?

51:54.800 --> 51:56.044
You have their number?

51:56.081 --> 51:58.382
Not on the phone, I didn't.

51:58.416 --> 52:03.053
I wasn't absolutely positive
whom I was speaking to.

52:03.088 --> 52:04.681
That's how they find out
if you're home

52:04.721 --> 52:07.754
so they can come in
and rape you.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.698
I understand.

52:10.737 --> 52:11.981
Can't be too careful.

52:12.016 --> 52:14.471
You give him a check... hmm!

52:14.513 --> 52:17.415
And you know
where he'll cash it, don't ya?

52:17.457 --> 52:19.180
The nearest bar.

52:19.217 --> 52:20.297
Oh!

52:20.337 --> 52:22.573
What's wrong?

52:22.609 --> 52:25.292
I should never bend
that far from the waist!

52:25.329 --> 52:28.263
It's like somebody
stuck a knife in me.

52:28.305 --> 52:29.646
Oh!

52:29.681 --> 52:32.463
That's your sacroiliac.

52:32.496 --> 52:35.344
Why don't you lay down
on the couch?

52:40.368 --> 52:44.809
No, no, let's get you
down here on the carpet.

52:44.848 --> 52:46.190
I'm gonna give you
a backrub.

52:46.224 --> 52:48.461
I had a foster mom
one time named Jackie.

52:48.496 --> 52:49.543
She was some kind of therapist.

52:49.585 --> 52:51.308
She worked with cripples.

52:51.344 --> 52:52.654
She showed me how.

52:52.688 --> 52:56.071
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

52:56.112 --> 52:57.127
Yes, ma'am.

52:57.169 --> 52:58.696
Oh!

53:00.816 --> 53:03.304
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you?

53:06.832 --> 53:10.061
Oh! Ohh!

53:14.384 --> 53:16.392
What the fuck
did you do?

53:21.265 --> 53:25.061
Oh, God! Fuck!
I just gave her a backrub.

53:25.105 --> 53:26.446
Jesus!

53:28.400 --> 53:30.058
It's a Missouri code.

53:30.096 --> 53:32.136
I did a bank there once.

53:41.488 --> 53:42.797
Hi, it's Matt and Pam.

53:42.832 --> 53:44.425
We're not here.
We'll call you back.

53:46.192 --> 53:47.272
Hello.

53:48.592 --> 53:49.770
Hello?

53:53.553 --> 53:54.862
Hello.

54:32.272 --> 54:33.766
Hi, it's Matt and Pam.

54:33.808 --> 54:36.045
We're not here.
We'll call you back.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.277
Hey, it's me. I tried
calling you a couple times.

54:39.312 --> 54:40.294
Wayne.

54:42.065 --> 54:44.650
No, I'm fine.

54:44.689 --> 54:45.899
What?

54:45.936 --> 54:48.009
I'm losing you. What?

54:49.137 --> 54:50.381
We gotta make a plan.

54:50.416 --> 54:51.910
That's my fucking phone!

54:51.952 --> 54:54.341
You want to wait
till they trace the number?

54:54.385 --> 54:56.359
That thing had all
my fuckin' numbers in it.

54:58.288 --> 55:00.230
Why don't we go to Missouri?

55:00.272 --> 55:01.701
- We will.
- Yeah? When?

55:01.744 --> 55:03.632
When they stop looking
for us,

55:03.664 --> 55:06.698
or when they think
we stopped looking for them.

55:06.736 --> 55:10.478
So, Gerald,
this is the master bedroom.

55:12.720 --> 55:17.063
I love how you guys
say "master bedroom."

55:17.104 --> 55:20.071
Yes, we guys
like our guy words.

55:21.648 --> 55:23.982
You're not from here.

55:24.016 --> 55:25.260
That's right.

55:25.296 --> 55:26.954
Where are you from?

55:31.216 --> 55:32.645
Detroit way.

55:32.689 --> 55:34.445
I know Detroit.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.579
We, uh, didn't look
at the kitchen.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.673
Are you following me?

55:53.712 --> 55:54.857
Excuse me?

55:54.896 --> 55:55.823
Are you following me?

55:55.856 --> 55:58.573
Mrs. Benkowski, hello.

55:58.609 --> 56:00.463
How'd the viewing work out?

56:00.496 --> 56:02.056
Well, you should know.

56:02.097 --> 56:03.209
You were outside
this morning.

56:03.248 --> 56:04.841
Hey, did you make
a sale with Gerald?

56:04.880 --> 56:07.018
I know he's been
looking at a lot of places.

56:07.056 --> 56:08.517
Do they know we're here?

56:08.561 --> 56:09.771
Are they coming after us?

56:09.808 --> 56:11.085
Listen, you come by
the office anytime.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.233
It's always good to see you.

56:18.928 --> 56:20.357
What if we're bait?

56:21.616 --> 56:22.826
What are you talkin' about?

56:22.865 --> 56:24.425
What if we're
being used as bait?

56:24.464 --> 56:26.090
What if the FBI's just waiting

56:26.128 --> 56:27.557
for those two freaks
to find us

56:27.600 --> 56:29.608
so they can find them?

56:29.648 --> 56:31.470
What if they
show up here, Wayne?

56:31.505 --> 56:33.708
They'll get caught.

56:33.744 --> 56:35.599
Oh. Before they kill us.

56:35.632 --> 56:36.680
Sure.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.542
Yeah, I vote for before.

56:39.537 --> 56:41.871
I can't even begin
to pretend to do my job here.

56:41.904 --> 56:43.333
I show a house,
I'm just waiting

56:43.377 --> 56:45.100
for somebody
to pull a gun on me.

56:45.136 --> 56:47.209
What's the choice?
I mean, I don't understand.

56:47.248 --> 56:48.742
I could sit here
and go crazy.

56:48.785 --> 56:50.727
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

56:50.768 --> 56:51.716
Listen...

56:53.392 --> 56:54.919
can we try something different?

56:55.888 --> 56:57.644
Come down after work one night.

56:57.680 --> 57:00.844
Meet some of the guys
and their wives.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.506
You know, they're good people.

57:02.544 --> 57:04.300
There's little places
along the river.

57:04.336 --> 57:06.409
We could get something to eat.

57:07.664 --> 57:10.566
Does nothing bother you?

57:10.608 --> 57:12.135
Sure, yeah.
This bothers me.

57:12.177 --> 57:13.486
You and me.

57:15.057 --> 57:16.518
Not gangsters.

58:03.792 --> 58:05.548
I need you to do
something for me.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.909
Is that what you dragged me
out here to tell me?

58:11.312 --> 58:13.287
You got some balls on you,
chief, I'll give you that.

58:13.328 --> 58:15.783
I don't give a fuck
what you need.

58:15.824 --> 58:17.679
Yes, you do.

58:17.712 --> 58:19.883
That's why you come
when I called.

58:21.168 --> 58:23.404
You don't want
the cops picking me up.

58:23.440 --> 58:26.407
If for some reason
they start asking me,

58:26.448 --> 58:29.580
was I in Detroit
when the old man was killed.

58:29.616 --> 58:31.885
And how the fuck
they gonna connect me

58:31.920 --> 58:33.097
to a half-breed
piece of shit

58:33.136 --> 58:34.827
they dragged up
from the bottom of this lake?

58:36.464 --> 58:39.246
The blue Cadillac
you gave me,

58:39.280 --> 58:41.582
the one with the papers
in the glove compartment,

58:41.616 --> 58:45.358
registered
to your pepperoni company.

58:45.392 --> 58:47.596
Anything happen to me,

58:47.632 --> 58:50.479
a friend gonna drive the car
to some precinct.

58:50.512 --> 58:52.650
They gonna find
the piece I used

58:52.688 --> 58:56.485
to whack the old man for you
wrapped in a letter...

58:56.528 --> 58:59.211
from me about you.

58:59.248 --> 59:01.614
Not a love letter.

59:03.152 --> 59:06.250
This is what
you're gonna do for me.

59:06.288 --> 59:09.190
There's a cemetery
in Port Huron.

59:09.232 --> 59:12.266
My kid brother
is buried there.

59:12.304 --> 59:15.882
He never had the kind
of funeral he deserved.

59:18.736 --> 59:21.224
You can be walkin' around
on that skinny little beam,

59:21.264 --> 59:23.533
and you've got clouds
around your head.

59:24.880 --> 59:28.295
I mean, some days, you think
you see things so clear.

59:28.336 --> 59:31.500
The place you live,
the store you shop in,

59:31.536 --> 59:33.030
the church
you got married in.

59:33.072 --> 59:34.446
I could see everything.

59:34.480 --> 59:36.236
Everywhere I'd ever been
my whole life

59:36.272 --> 59:37.930
from the top of a building.

59:37.968 --> 59:40.750
So why the hell
did you quit and come here?

59:40.784 --> 59:42.889
Job quit me, man.

59:42.928 --> 59:44.935
Get to an age,
they start pullin' you down,

59:44.976 --> 59:46.983
about one floor a year.

59:47.024 --> 59:48.682
End up too near the ground.

59:48.720 --> 59:50.956
I got my pride.

59:50.992 --> 59:52.453
Too much maybe.

59:52.496 --> 59:54.536
I've been watchin' you, honey,

59:54.576 --> 59:56.299
and you should talk less
and drink more.

59:58.544 --> 01:00:00.137
I think these poor folks

01:00:00.176 --> 01:00:03.111
deserve another round there,
uh... Linda.

01:00:03.152 --> 01:00:05.257
Oh, ho ho, yeah.

01:00:05.296 --> 01:00:07.238
Hey, Pam, honey,
how did you, uh...

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.095
fall for a shy guy like Matt?

01:00:11.504 --> 01:00:13.576
- His muscles.
- Ahh!

01:00:13.616 --> 01:00:14.696
And the short shorts.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:15.913
Ooh!

01:00:15.952 --> 01:00:17.545
Nah, he was
a show-off, even back then.

01:00:17.584 --> 01:00:19.820
I had to show off
to get her attention.

01:00:19.856 --> 01:00:22.125
Every guy in town's
chasin' after her.

01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:24.810
Not only is she gorgeous,
she's smart as a whip.

01:00:24.848 --> 01:00:26.157
Don't exaggerate, Matthew.

01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:28.199
Her mother's always sayin',
"Carmen, honey"...

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.301
because that's
what her mother called her

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:33.612
'cause she's a great singer.

01:00:33.648 --> 01:00:36.201
She'd say, "Carmen, honey,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.345
"you're a talented,
beautiful girl.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:41.417
"Don't go wastin' your life
on an ironworker.

01:00:41.456 --> 01:00:43.180
"You're gonna wake up
in 20 years,

01:00:43.216 --> 01:00:46.064
and you're gonna realize,
he never deserved you."

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:49.161
15 years.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.233
He is such a liar.

01:00:52.271 --> 01:00:53.580
My mother adores him.

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.721
We got karaoke here
on Friday.

01:00:55.759 --> 01:00:57.003
You gotta come.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.967
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.105
You wait.
She's a knockout.

01:01:00.144 --> 01:01:02.348
Ah ha ha. I'm gonna
knock you out, Matt.

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:10.860
"I have been
watching you, honey.

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:12.968
You should talk less
and drink more."

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.512
Why is it that
I feel I know you best

01:01:17.552 --> 01:01:20.007
when I hear you talking
with other people?

01:01:20.048 --> 01:01:21.357
I felt good tonight.

01:01:21.392 --> 01:01:22.799
I like this town.

01:01:24.272 --> 01:01:26.028
Telling all your stories.

01:01:26.064 --> 01:01:27.526
Hey, nothin'
I said tonight back there

01:01:27.568 --> 01:01:28.877
wasn't the God's truth.

01:01:28.912 --> 01:01:30.537
Hmm.

01:01:31.887 --> 01:01:32.902
No.

01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:35.366
Don't turn on the light.

01:01:43.536 --> 01:01:44.780
You married?

01:01:47.216 --> 01:01:49.583
No, sir, I'm on a break.

01:01:50.704 --> 01:01:52.231
Live around here?

01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:56.077
I can't tell you
where I live.

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.672
That's a government secret.

01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:57.294
We found them
last week.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.789
Two bodies, probably shot,
driven to a remote location,

01:03:02.831 --> 01:03:04.358
and burned in the car.

01:03:04.399 --> 01:03:06.025
Nothing much left
to be identified.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.727
The Indian has
a surviving brother.

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:13.134
He's doing life in Kingston
Correctional Facility.

01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:17.610
We ran DNA tests,
and we checked them against his.

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:21.166
Match was positive.

01:03:25.232 --> 01:03:27.119
What happens to us now?

01:03:27.152 --> 01:03:28.712
Well,
after we close the case,

01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:31.402
you can go back
to your life.

01:03:31.439 --> 01:03:33.000
What if we
don't want to go back?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.982
That happens.

01:03:37.295 --> 01:03:40.165
But what you're saying is,
if we wanted to, we could?

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:41.964
That also happens.

01:03:52.047 --> 01:03:53.640
It's still busy.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.989
Try her again.

01:03:57.007 --> 01:03:59.179
I'm not your fuckin'
kid brother.

01:03:59.216 --> 01:04:00.361
You can't order me around.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.018
I know that, Richie.
I buried my kid brother.

01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:05.129
So lighten up. We're dead.

01:04:05.168 --> 01:04:08.430
If they dig around some more,
we're alive.

01:04:08.464 --> 01:04:10.886
We just bought us
some more time, that's all.

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:12.422
Now try the old lady again.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:17.453
She's, uh, packing,
Lenore. Let me go find her.

01:04:21.072 --> 01:04:23.821
She says she'll call you
when she gets back to the house.

01:04:23.856 --> 01:04:25.449
You're not
coming together?

01:04:25.488 --> 01:04:26.503
No. As a matter of fact,

01:04:26.544 --> 01:04:28.846
I'm stayin' down here
for a while.

01:04:28.879 --> 01:04:30.373
What do you mean,
for a while?

01:04:30.416 --> 01:04:33.318
Kind of a trial separation.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.531
I don't understand.

01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:37.226
I'm not sure we do, either.

01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:40.046
But that's where we're at.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.967
Have you been
fighting again?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.625
No, no fighting.

01:04:43.664 --> 01:04:44.744
You will not break up.

01:04:44.784 --> 01:04:46.693
Lord knows
I prayed for it.

01:04:46.736 --> 01:04:48.492
Okay, Mom,
appreciate it.

01:04:51.664 --> 01:04:55.625
Well, she says
no way we'll break up.

01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:58.598
"Lord knows I prayed for it.
It'll never happen."

01:05:01.744 --> 01:05:06.730
<i>Mississippi River Navigation</i>
<i>and Rules of Inland Waterways?</i>

01:05:06.768 --> 01:05:08.743
Homework.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:09.766
Lot of laughs.

01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:13.381
I'll wait for the movie.

01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:16.297
Can we at least
give it a try...

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.502
now that we're safe?

01:05:19.536 --> 01:05:21.226
Maybe Matt and Pam
can fix the things

01:05:21.264 --> 01:05:22.638
Wayne and Carmen
never could.

01:05:24.176 --> 01:05:25.582
Do you honestly believe that?

01:05:25.616 --> 01:05:27.307
I honestly do.

01:05:30.704 --> 01:05:31.652
Stay.

01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:35.078
- No.
- Stay.

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.047
No.

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.224
Fight with me.

01:05:37.264 --> 01:05:38.246
No.

01:05:38.288 --> 01:05:39.662
Don't say no.

01:05:39.696 --> 01:05:41.321
It's not one thing.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.229
It's not one day.

01:05:44.271 --> 01:05:47.588
It's not a baby, or...

01:05:47.632 --> 01:05:48.712
no baby.

01:05:50.256 --> 01:05:52.078
It's years.

01:05:53.136 --> 01:05:55.176
And I need time, Wayne.

01:05:55.216 --> 01:05:58.532
Time to remember
what I cared for you,

01:05:58.575 --> 01:06:00.299
and what you cared for me.

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:01.448
Okay, let's fix that.

01:06:03.408 --> 01:06:05.034
I think we can fix that.

01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:08.841
I think we started
to fix it right here.

01:06:24.816 --> 01:06:25.928
Who is it?

01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:48.906
Are you leaving?

01:06:53.647 --> 01:06:54.596
Richie, too?

01:06:59.536 --> 01:07:02.121
What did he tell you
about me?

01:07:03.663 --> 01:07:05.518
You know how he is.

01:07:05.552 --> 01:07:07.046
He brags about you a lot.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.853
What I do for a living?

01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:14.413
That's none
of my business, Armand.

01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:18.217
I've enjoyed your company...

01:07:18.255 --> 01:07:20.197
and I think
you're a nice person,

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.606
and I wish you all the best.

01:07:38.063 --> 01:07:39.819
I forgot somethin'.

01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:22.886
Please pick up.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.773
Hi. It's Matt and Pam.

01:09:32.814 --> 01:09:34.538
We're not here.
We'll call you back.

01:10:00.176 --> 01:10:01.485
Hungry?

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.269
Your mom told us
you'd be home by breakfast.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.929
You could have driven
a little faster.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.684
We're gettin' hungry.

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:19.655
Mmm! Now you got nice hair.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.789
Why don't you scoot over?

01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:25.547
I want to get somethin' here.

01:10:27.727 --> 01:10:30.956
You want to fix
the Bird some lunch?

01:10:30.992 --> 01:10:32.486
We brought our own food.

01:10:34.415 --> 01:10:35.397
What do you want?

01:10:36.463 --> 01:10:38.372
Just waiting
for your husband.

01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:39.910
And then what?

01:10:45.103 --> 01:10:47.372
What? You can't say it?

01:10:47.407 --> 01:10:48.717
I know why you're here.

01:10:51.343 --> 01:10:52.936
The last time
you had the shotgun,

01:10:52.976 --> 01:10:56.391
the 12-gauge, you wanted
to shoot me, didn't you?

01:10:56.431 --> 01:10:57.675
But you couldn't.

01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:01.574
Where is it?

01:11:01.616 --> 01:11:02.957
In Missouri.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.345
So your husband has it.

01:11:06.383 --> 01:11:08.270
I hope so.

01:11:08.303 --> 01:11:09.383
Why don't we
just shoot her now, Bird,

01:11:09.423 --> 01:11:10.852
and take care
of the husband later?

01:11:10.895 --> 01:11:13.383
Yeah? What if he calls her?

01:11:13.423 --> 01:11:14.667
Don't answer the phone.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.165
He'd think she went out
to get food

01:11:16.207 --> 01:11:17.418
to fix him lunch.

01:11:17.455 --> 01:11:20.619
He comes in.
"Hi, honey, I'm home." boom!

01:11:41.007 --> 01:11:44.106
What's "Hot doe buck lure"?

01:11:44.143 --> 01:11:45.321
Why don't you try some?

01:11:45.359 --> 01:11:46.766
Maybe you'll attract a deer.

01:11:48.431 --> 01:11:51.301
You makin'
the Bird some lunch?

01:11:51.343 --> 01:11:53.350
He put in an order
for dessert yet?

01:11:55.439 --> 01:11:56.715
I eat chicken every meal.

01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:58.539
Know why?

01:11:58.575 --> 01:11:59.753
No.

01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:03.206
'Cause Wade Boggs ate
chicken before every game.

01:12:03.247 --> 01:12:05.102
That's why they called him
"the chicken man."

01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:06.923
Bird, do you know
who Wade Boggs is?

01:12:06.959 --> 01:12:08.901
Ah, Bird doesn't know shit.

01:12:08.943 --> 01:12:10.569
Yeah, I was gonna be
a major league ballplayer

01:12:10.607 --> 01:12:13.542
until my deprived childhood
as an orphan

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:14.531
fucked up my chances,

01:12:14.576 --> 01:12:16.485
so I became a bank robber
instead.

01:12:20.207 --> 01:12:22.509
Hey, Carmen, I got an idea.

01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:24.037
Why don't you
take your clothes off?

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:29.863
You don't have to take off
all your clothes.

01:12:29.903 --> 01:12:32.838
You can leave on your panties
and your brassiere...

01:12:32.879 --> 01:12:35.083
if you wear a brassiere.
Do you?

01:12:36.847 --> 01:12:38.309
Do you?

01:12:38.351 --> 01:12:40.806
Oh, Bird, she don't wear one!

01:12:40.848 --> 01:12:43.182
Well, you can just strip down
to your panties then,

01:12:43.215 --> 01:12:45.354
be our little topless bunny,

01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:46.569
serve us drinks.

01:12:46.608 --> 01:12:47.884
Aah! God!

01:12:50.319 --> 01:12:51.529
You're gonna have
to kick harder than that.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.028
Come here!

01:13:11.151 --> 01:13:13.868
I think you're gonna
feel a lot better

01:13:13.903 --> 01:13:16.172
if you go in the bathroom
and take off your clothes...

01:13:16.207 --> 01:13:17.636
and wash yourself.

01:13:35.695 --> 01:13:36.939
Hey!

01:13:39.727 --> 01:13:41.134
Use that one.

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:15.883
You need somewhere
to sleep off that hangover?

01:14:21.743 --> 01:14:23.369
Give me five minutes.

01:14:23.407 --> 01:14:24.869
Okay.

01:14:47.023 --> 01:14:48.713
I said
I want you topless.

01:14:51.823 --> 01:14:54.212
That's my husband's jacket.
Take it off.

01:14:54.255 --> 01:14:55.946
Why don't we make a trade?

01:14:55.983 --> 01:14:57.412
I'll take off the jacket...

01:14:58.383 --> 01:14:59.332
you take off your top.

01:15:00.975 --> 01:15:04.619
No. I like your outfit.

01:15:04.655 --> 01:15:06.411
You look like
a little schoolgirl.

01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:10.603
Go on. Hold that.

01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:27.021
Oh. Now you're gonna
answer the fucking phone?

01:15:28.303 --> 01:15:29.251
Let it ring.

01:15:37.551 --> 01:15:38.795
Hi.
We're not in right now,

01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:39.779
so go ahead and leave a mess...

01:15:55.279 --> 01:15:57.384
Jesus Christ, Bird,
you ever stop eatin'?

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.292
Aw. What's wrong
with our little bunny?

01:16:01.327 --> 01:16:03.302
You scared? What?

01:16:03.343 --> 01:16:05.198
There's no reason to be.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.474
Ol' Wayne comes home,

01:16:06.511 --> 01:16:08.366
just gonna have
a little talk with him.

01:16:08.399 --> 01:16:10.123
Isn't that right, Bird?

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:14.853
Hey, Bird, you gonna ask
if anyone else wants some

01:16:14.895 --> 01:16:17.131
'fore you finish it?

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:19.054
Man, what you gonna do
when Donna asks you to wear

01:16:19.087 --> 01:16:22.087
one of them Elvis jumpsuits
for her?

01:16:22.127 --> 01:16:23.785
I guess you could always wear
that pink one he had

01:16:23.823 --> 01:16:26.027
after he swolled up like a pig.

01:16:26.063 --> 01:16:28.484
I read about this guy once,

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:30.566
weighed 1,200 pounds.
Can you believe that?

01:16:32.143 --> 01:16:35.110
For breakfast, he'd have
like two pounds of bacon,

01:16:35.151 --> 01:16:36.525
a dozen eggs, some rolls.

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:39.242
Then for lunch,
he'd have four hamburgers,

01:16:39.279 --> 01:16:42.214
four double cheeseburgers,
eight boxes of fries.

01:16:42.255 --> 01:16:45.452
For dinner, three ham steaks,
six sweet potatoes,

01:16:45.487 --> 01:16:49.099
six or seven regular potatoes,
some stuffing.

01:16:49.135 --> 01:16:52.518
Carmen, can you imagine
this guy takin' a dump?

01:16:57.326 --> 01:17:01.866
See, Donna,
that's the Bird's sweetheart.

01:17:01.903 --> 01:17:05.286
When this is all done,
the Bird and Donna...

01:17:05.327 --> 01:17:07.149
they're gonna
go down to Memphis,

01:17:07.183 --> 01:17:11.143
hold hands,
look at all that Elvis shit.

01:17:11.183 --> 01:17:12.906
Isn't that right, Bird?

01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:15.817
Only trouble is,

01:17:15.855 --> 01:17:18.026
Donna is probably fuckin' Elvis
as we speak.

01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:41.161
You get one, Richie,
just like everybody else.

01:18:04.495 --> 01:18:05.956
You know why I shot him?

01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:11.530
He wasn't who I thought he was.

01:18:14.478 --> 01:18:16.867
I had this kid brother.

01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:20.009
We were in a hospital
one time on a job.

01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:22.661
And when we were done,

01:18:22.703 --> 01:18:24.361
there was this nurse
standing there.

01:18:26.575 --> 01:18:28.430
She saw us do it.

01:18:32.335 --> 01:18:35.269
My kid brother just stood there,
looking at her.

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:43.725
He looked at her too long.

01:18:47.183 --> 01:18:49.070
Maybe he liked her face.

01:18:57.103 --> 01:18:58.826
Anyway,
that's what killed him.

01:19:04.623 --> 01:19:06.030
Go put some clothes on.

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.057
I have to go upstairs.

01:19:19.503 --> 01:19:21.129
I'm not like Richie.

01:19:22.607 --> 01:19:24.101
I'm not the same as him.

01:19:27.759 --> 01:19:28.741
I know.

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:55.495
Aah!

01:20:56.782 --> 01:20:59.171
You meet a woman.

01:20:59.215 --> 01:21:02.346
You kid yourself
she sees you.

01:21:02.382 --> 01:21:04.771
Sees who you really are
under all the shit.

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:08.838
Turns out, just another bitch
with the lip service.

01:21:08.879 --> 01:21:10.373
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

01:21:10.414 --> 01:21:12.105
- I do see you.
- Shut up.

01:21:12.142 --> 01:21:14.052
I panic. I panicked
when I saw the gun.

01:21:14.095 --> 01:21:15.022
I... I panicked.

01:21:15.055 --> 01:21:16.462
Shut up!

01:21:16.495 --> 01:21:18.088
Where's your husband?

01:21:18.127 --> 01:21:19.054
I don't know.

01:21:19.087 --> 01:21:20.134
When's he get back?

01:21:20.174 --> 01:21:21.352
I don't know.

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:23.430
Well, then you call him.

01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:25.958
You call him, and
you tell him to get back here.

01:21:27.279 --> 01:21:28.457
I'm tired of waiting.

01:21:28.495 --> 01:21:30.317
I want to finish this.

01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:32.009
No, please.

01:21:34.574 --> 01:21:36.429
He's not coming back.

01:21:36.463 --> 01:21:38.983
He's in Missouri.

01:21:39.022 --> 01:21:41.357
He's not even
my husband anymore.

01:21:43.247 --> 01:21:45.352
Don't you get it?

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.846
Don't you know anything
about real life?

01:21:50.286 --> 01:21:52.109
Real life?

01:21:52.143 --> 01:21:53.998
What the fuck is that?

01:22:15.215 --> 01:22:16.589
Missouri, huh?

01:22:24.494 --> 01:22:25.639
Carmen?

01:22:27.343 --> 01:22:28.390
It's me!

01:22:30.415 --> 01:22:32.040
Tried calling.

01:22:33.423 --> 01:22:34.601
Honey?

01:22:36.814 --> 01:22:37.927
You're gonna have to let me in.

01:22:37.967 --> 01:22:40.007
I... I don't have a key.

01:22:40.046 --> 01:22:41.475
Wayne, please go.

01:22:41.518 --> 01:22:42.893
Okay, all right.

01:22:42.926 --> 01:22:44.999
Just hear me out.

01:22:47.151 --> 01:22:51.558
Look, I've had 400 miles,
15 years

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.126
to think about this, so...

01:22:54.927 --> 01:22:56.715
say five's terrible, right?

01:22:56.751 --> 01:22:58.889
That's what you said.

01:22:58.927 --> 01:23:01.512
So let's go for six.

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:08.172
And then if we make it to six,
then we could try for seven.

01:23:09.295 --> 01:23:14.630
'Cause... I really want
to make it to 10 for you.

01:23:16.047 --> 01:23:19.724
Carmen, 'cause I get it now.

01:23:19.758 --> 01:23:21.700
Carmen?

01:23:29.262 --> 01:23:30.888
I understand.

01:23:30.926 --> 01:23:35.149
So, uh, if you're
not gonna let me in,

01:23:35.182 --> 01:23:38.150
then at least
let me get somethin'...

01:23:39.663 --> 01:23:41.834
in the car.

01:23:41.871 --> 01:23:43.561
A present. I left it.

01:23:49.134 --> 01:23:50.083
Ooh!

01:24:17.103 --> 01:24:19.372
Aah! Aah! God!

01:24:32.655 --> 01:24:34.411
Aah!

01:24:35.695 --> 01:24:37.550
Aah!

01:24:37.582 --> 01:24:41.095
You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:44.554
You gotta have it
figured out.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:49.412
Don't hang around.

01:24:49.454 --> 01:24:50.883
Don't get interested.

01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:53.575
It's empty.

01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:57.773
Then you
don't make mistakes.

01:26:57.774 --> 01:26:58.774
