WEBVTT

00:42.709 --> 00:43.793
Dad.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.848
Let me see you.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.142
Get out!

01:15.325 --> 01:16.868
Damn it.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.329
They're not here.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.289
Who are you?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.041
How did you get here?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.295
I heard something.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.091
I thought they were here.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.427
Out of my way.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.518
Where did you come from? Is it okay there?

01:42.018 --> 01:44.062
It's fucking okay everywhere.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.899
The school is heaven.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.986
-Later.
-Where are you going?

01:52.487 --> 01:53.780
You'll die if you go out.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.741
Don't go out, asshole! Do as I say.

02:07.919 --> 02:08.962
Aren't you hungry?

02:09.921 --> 02:10.797
What?

02:19.055 --> 02:19.889
Aren't you

02:21.432 --> 02:22.392
hungry?

02:23.059 --> 02:24.185
I'm starving.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.316
I'm full right now.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.069
So you get to live.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.280
Count yourself lucky.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.704
What is that smell?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.045
Why do you smell like them?

02:51.546 --> 02:52.922
What? What do you smell?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.049
Let go of me.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.635
You were with Cheong-san, weren't you?

02:57.719 --> 02:58.928
Who's that?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.681
-Where is that asshole?
-What are you talking about?

03:03.057 --> 03:03.933
You want to know?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.647
Are you okay?

03:10.523 --> 03:11.357
Are you hurt?

03:11.441 --> 03:13.067
What took you so long?

03:13.735 --> 03:14.652
I kept waiting.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.366
Are you kids okay?

03:23.953 --> 03:24.787
Yes.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.206
Good.

03:31.127 --> 03:31.961
Cheong-san.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.215
Mr. Nam.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.602
Can you all run?

03:48.519 --> 03:49.646
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:51.856 --> 03:52.690
Good.

03:53.816 --> 03:57.070
If you go through the tennis courts
and the construction site,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.364
you'll reach the mountain.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.076
Go over the mountain and get to Yangdong--

04:03.159 --> 04:03.993
Mr. Nam!

04:16.214 --> 04:17.298
Kids. Run!

04:17.382 --> 04:18.341
Shit.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.805
GYMNASIUM

04:23.888 --> 04:25.056
Hurry!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.228
Run! Hurry!

04:31.562 --> 04:32.689
To the tennis courts!

04:33.690 --> 04:34.524
Hurry up!

04:38.444 --> 04:40.196
Run. Go inside!

04:40.905 --> 04:41.739
Go in.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.415
Get in!

04:55.920 --> 04:57.046
Run!

04:58.423 --> 04:59.841
Hey. Hold on.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.143
We can't go out there. We can't.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.186
What should we do, Dae-su?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.229
Damn it.

05:13.771 --> 05:14.605
What do we do?

05:16.107 --> 05:17.108
We're screwed.

05:19.986 --> 05:20.862
Hey!

05:53.853 --> 05:54.771
Step back.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.731
Let's go.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.069
Hurry.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.572
Hurry.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.369
Cheong-san, take On-jo.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.788
Dad. Where are you going?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.498
Dad!

06:14.082 --> 06:14.916
Dad!

06:18.544 --> 06:19.545
Dad!

06:23.633 --> 06:24.592
Dad!

06:35.019 --> 06:35.937
Dad!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.356
Run!

06:40.817 --> 06:42.652
Get out! Go out now!

06:43.861 --> 06:45.029
Go!

06:50.868 --> 06:51.828
Mr. Nam!

06:54.163 --> 06:56.499
Go! Get out!

07:03.673 --> 07:04.841
Dad.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.969
Dad.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.722
Look at me, On-jo.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.141
Go.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.603
Run.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.150
-Go!
-Dad.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.569
Go!

07:25.153 --> 07:27.071
Go!

07:28.322 --> 07:30.074
On-jo! Go…

07:31.617 --> 07:32.577
Run.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.248
Dad…

07:38.833 --> 07:40.001
On-jo!

07:41.002 --> 07:42.753
Run!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.591
Dad!

07:58.603 --> 08:02.565
NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK

08:03.149 --> 08:03.983
Hurry!

08:07.695 --> 08:08.779
No!

08:10.156 --> 08:11.240
What? Why?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.957
Go upstairs. Go!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.001
Hurry! To the second floor!

08:22.793 --> 08:23.961
Hurry!

08:35.348 --> 08:36.724
Where do we go?

08:40.811 --> 08:42.355
There's no way out. It's blocked.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.066
-There's nothing here too.
-This way!

08:47.944 --> 08:49.529
-Is there a way?
-Let's go out this way.

08:50.112 --> 08:50.947
The bench.

08:56.035 --> 08:56.994
Hurry up.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.250
Damn it.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.803
Careful.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.478
Stay away from the edge.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.479
Okay.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.527
-Come here.
-Quiet.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.113
Don't say a word.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.003
On-jo! Go!

09:47.503 --> 09:49.088
Dad!

11:08.668 --> 11:09.752
It's okay.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.046
Just cry.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.178
It's better to just die.

11:23.391 --> 11:27.478
This virus changes a person
into a different being.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.314
The person I loved

11:31.482 --> 11:32.900
becomes a monster.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.529
You can forget someone who dies…

11:41.659 --> 11:43.869
but it's hard to forget someone
who has changed.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.069
That is the last image…

12:20.072 --> 12:21.449
of the people I loved most.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.472
Remember now?

12:45.014 --> 12:49.101
I don't know anyone
named Cheong-san, you freak.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.730
Everyone went to the auditorium,
and I got out

12:53.856 --> 12:55.065
by myself.

12:55.149 --> 12:55.983
Auditorium?

12:56.650 --> 12:59.236
I don't know who Cheong-san is.

13:00.404 --> 13:03.991
We went with some juniors. That's all.

13:06.535 --> 13:10.039
Then they must be
at the auditorium right now.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.674
You're fucking brave.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.723
You'd better run.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.558
Or I'll eat you.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.304
I told you to run. Why don't you listen?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.360
Fuck. Nothing is working out.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.279
We keep hitting dead ends.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.738
Be quiet.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.575
It's your fault Joon-yeong died.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.159
Dae-su. Don't.

14:29.243 --> 14:33.372
If you hadn't bitched at him earlier,
he wouldn't have jumped out there.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.751
Fine. It's my fault he died. Happy?

14:38.627 --> 14:41.088
-Are you happy, asshole?
-You give it a rest too.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.464
Dae-su.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.260
What does it matter who's responsible
for someone living or dying?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.637
What does living or dying even mean?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.014
I have no idea.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.850
If we get out of here, is that living?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.227
Our friends died.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.105
Our moms and dads died.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.150
What's the point in living?

15:01.817 --> 15:02.943
Do you want to die?

15:03.527 --> 15:04.612
Then will you die?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.448
Have you tried being seniors?

15:07.948 --> 15:09.742
Do you even know
how it feels to want to die?

15:09.825 --> 15:11.243
Is it some badge of honor?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.913
You try being one.
You'll see what it's like.

15:13.996 --> 15:14.955
You juniors

15:16.415 --> 15:19.877
better survive until next year
and see what it's like being seniors.

15:21.211 --> 15:25.424
Survive until next year and tell me
which is tougher, zombies or senior year.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.848
Your father…

15:36.310 --> 15:37.937
He saved all of us.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.483
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.610
None of us will.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.991
If someone is remembered by many people,
that person…

15:54.995 --> 15:56.121
goes to heaven.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.429
Mi-jin.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.098
Let's go.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.099
Where? Why?

16:15.683 --> 16:19.144
Let's look for a spot
we can jump off from. We're the seniors.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.981
Whatever. It's not like
they show us any respect.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.316
I'll go this way. You go that way.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.779
Damn it. She's so cool.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.158
I'll go.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.284
Stay down.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.327
No.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.457
Why, you…

16:40.541 --> 16:41.417
Move.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.427
Shit.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.350
I hope no one steps up anymore.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.313
Whatever happens…

17:05.524 --> 17:07.651
I hope no one sacrifices themselves.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.783
It's too hard living
because of someone else.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.328
There's nothing we can do for them.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.916
Living life to the full
in honor of the person who died…

17:23.917 --> 17:24.877
It's too selfish.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.131
You can't die even if you want to.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.093
You lack the courage to live,
but you can't die.

17:37.014 --> 17:37.848
Let's…

17:39.308 --> 17:40.517
let's talk a little later.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.981
Tomorrow or the day after. Or next week.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.569
After we eat and get ourselves clean.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.281
That's what we agreed to do.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.127
This side.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.422
What?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.591
You probably don't remember.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.635
Don't remember what?

18:14.718 --> 18:15.719
Cheong-san, hold on.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.434
Is this better

18:23.477 --> 18:24.311
or is this better?

18:26.730 --> 18:29.650
Look closely. This? Or this?

18:31.318 --> 18:34.238
The left side is much better.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.699
What are you talking about?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.246
I'll tell you tomorrow.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.881
Cheong-san.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.967
ONE HEART

19:11.400 --> 19:13.610
This moron became a zombie.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.555
Next we'll raise it to 24 kHz.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.819
Turn it off!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.822
Tests we ran in 17 locations across Hyosan

20:40.906 --> 20:44.159
showed that they reacted
most strongly to 24 kHz.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.711
We'll begin the briefing.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.631
We will emit sounds using drones

20:57.714 --> 21:00.050
and draw the infected to target locations

21:00.133 --> 21:04.054
to maximize the impact
with minimal explosions.

21:04.137 --> 21:08.225
There are four target locations.
The Hyosan Intersection,

21:08.308 --> 21:12.646
the sports complex, Hyosan High,
and Hyosan Future College.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.814
Estimated casualties?

21:13.897 --> 21:16.358
Hyosan has a population of 170,000,

21:16.441 --> 21:18.860
and 110,000 of them are
in quarantine camps.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.988
Thus, we estimate about 60,000 casualties.

21:21.071 --> 21:25.659
About 50,000 are infected,
and 10,000 are uninfected or asymptomatic.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.454
We'll send in ground troops after
the bombing to take care of the rest.

21:30.414 --> 21:34.293
Sound the evacuation warnings nonstop
until right before the operation begins.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.445
Eat him.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.869
It's okay. Eat him.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.874
I'm hungry.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.799
I'm hungry.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.410
It's okay.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.163
It's not okay.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.082
It is.

22:56.833 --> 22:57.876
If it happens again,

22:58.835 --> 22:59.961
bite me, not yourself.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.677
If you bite me, I'll just become like you.

23:26.363 --> 23:30.117
I really think that's the only way out.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.703
No. It drops into the basement
on that side,

23:33.787 --> 23:36.373
and there are exposed steel bars.
So we can't jump down.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.669
That side faces the school,
so there's no point.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.630
The ground is filled with zombies,
so we'll die if we go down.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.008
There's a door on the first floor
that leads to the mountain.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.635
I think we have to go that way.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.847
But it's full of zombies in there.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.564
Can't we reach the roof
if we climb that and the windows?

24:01.648 --> 24:04.860
If someone goes to the roof
and screams, the zombies will follow.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.488
Then it'll empty out
and the rest can escape.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.739
I think that will work.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.740
No.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.286
-If that's the only way--
-I said no.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.872
Please, let's not have
anyone sacrifice themselves.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.790
I'm against it too.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.085
We agreed to survive together.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.254
Me too.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.798
I feel the same.

24:29.050 --> 24:29.968
So do I.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.762
Then let's wait for now.

24:32.846 --> 24:33.763
And then what?

24:34.890 --> 24:35.849
Do you have a plan?

24:36.433 --> 24:38.935
It might rain again,
and then they'll hear us less.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.562
Who knows when it'll rain?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.857
My knees are aching.
I think it'll rain soon.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.400
Look at the sky.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.238
It's way too clear.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.411
Do you hear that?

24:59.080 --> 25:00.248
Hear what?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.627
They're telling us to take cover.

25:04.961 --> 25:05.921
Who is?

25:06.713 --> 25:08.340
Attention, all citizens.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.258
There will be explosions
at the sports complex,

25:10.342 --> 25:13.136
Hyosan High, Future College,
and Hyosan Intersection.

25:13.220 --> 25:17.807
If you hear this, take shelter in nearby
subways and underground parking lots…

25:17.891 --> 25:19.976
There'll be explosions.
We need to take cover.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.728
Explosions? What explosions?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.021
Listen again.

25:25.815 --> 25:28.318
Hyosan Intersection, Future College…

25:30.820 --> 25:32.531
and our school will be blown up.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.868
Is the army going to
fucking launch missiles at us?

25:36.952 --> 25:38.119
When?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.412
They're not saying.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.414
They're just telling people
to evacuate now.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.708
Fuck. Where are we supposed to go?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.961
So when are the explosions happening?

25:47.754 --> 25:48.964
Initiate operation.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.068
Activate the sound waves.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.759
Begin tactical flight.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.930
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

27:25.977 --> 27:27.896
Won't we all die if we stay here?

27:29.022 --> 27:30.649
Do they say where to flee to?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.985
They said hide underground
or in bathrooms.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.821
What if it's a nuclear bomb?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.367
Korea doesn't have nukes. Get a grip.

27:40.450 --> 27:41.493
Whatever!

27:42.243 --> 27:44.079
They're blowing up our school.

27:44.579 --> 27:47.582
Where are we supposed to take cover?
There's nowhere to go.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.461
Cheong-san!

27:52.629 --> 27:53.630
What?

27:58.176 --> 27:59.344
It's Gwi-nam.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.221
That asshole doesn't die.

28:01.721 --> 28:02.597
Who is that?

28:04.224 --> 28:05.558
Maybe we misheard.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.894
It's quiet now.

28:18.905 --> 28:19.739
Here you are.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.283
-What the hell?
-Cheong-san!

28:31.501 --> 28:32.335
Hey!

28:32.919 --> 28:33.753
Shit!

28:35.505 --> 28:36.381
Cheong-san!

29:26.097 --> 29:26.931
No.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.395
Cheong-san!

29:39.486 --> 29:40.737
Help! Hurry!

29:40.820 --> 29:42.822
Shit! Come on.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.792
Cheong-san!

29:53.875 --> 29:54.709
Move. Fuck!

30:32.247 --> 30:34.123
They've all arrived
at the target locations.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.291
Execute.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.335
Let me confirm the order.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.420
Fire!

30:55.353 --> 30:56.229
It's okay.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.815
It's not what you think. It's okay.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.360
I said it's okay.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.903
Don't do that.

31:04.487 --> 31:05.780
You'll be fine.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.365
On-jo.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.493
No one…

31:12.871 --> 31:14.205
will die here today.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.293
Don't say anything.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.255
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

31:42.066 --> 31:46.154
LEE CHEONG-SAN

31:48.364 --> 31:49.866
Hold onto it.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.622
I'll hold onto this.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.083
LEE CHEONG-SAN - NAM ON-JO

32:51.844 --> 32:54.138
Su-hyeok, go to the first floor.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.183
Cheong-san!

32:58.768 --> 32:59.852
Hey!

33:01.229 --> 33:02.480
Come get me. All of you.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.899
Today,

33:06.192 --> 33:07.276
I am

33:08.653 --> 33:11.447
the happiest guy in this school!

33:17.912 --> 33:18.746
Hey!

33:19.872 --> 33:21.040
Hey!

33:26.546 --> 33:28.297
Ha-ri. Let's go.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.466
We have to go.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.676
Let's go, Nam-ra.

33:32.927 --> 33:33.761
Let's go.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.350
Can you climb over?

33:42.603 --> 33:44.981
Careful. Step down.

33:45.648 --> 33:46.691
Hurry.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.151
Hey!

33:56.951 --> 33:58.536
Hey!

33:59.495 --> 34:01.622
Hey!

34:03.624 --> 34:05.710
Hey!

34:05.793 --> 34:07.712
-Hurry.
-Hurry up!

34:09.130 --> 34:09.964
Hey!

34:18.806 --> 34:20.683
CAUTION - RISK OF ACCIDENT

35:15.947 --> 35:17.490
Come at me.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.575
Come at me, all of you!

35:49.063 --> 35:51.774
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

35:56.612 --> 35:57.613
Keep moving.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.602
You know,

36:28.102 --> 36:31.147
I thought it would be really fun
to kill you.

36:33.774 --> 36:34.859
But not anymore.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.778
I'll kill you even if it isn't fun.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.530
Stop acting tough.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.867
Do you really think that makes you cool?

36:43.659 --> 36:45.244
No one thinks that.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.375
You're just scared that people
will find out you killed the principal.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.796
You'll always be a coward and a loser.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.229
I'm not scared of anything.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.733
I'm definitely not scared of you.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.912
I'll gouge out your eye first, fucker.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.527
Yeah, run away.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.159
I'll let you live if you run away.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.265
Sports complex. Bombing complete.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.482
Hyosan Intersection. Bombing complete.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.739
Future College. Bombing complete.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.604
Ha-ri!

40:42.690 --> 40:43.566
Are you okay?

40:54.493 --> 40:55.411
Commander.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.922
The operation is complete, Commander.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.886
Okay.

41:13.512 --> 41:16.265
Send in the troops in the morning
and take care of the rest.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.767
You take charge.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.520
Me, sir?

41:22.688 --> 41:24.064
I'm sure you can handle it.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.818
I need to sleep.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.945
I've been up for too long.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.310
Is this a friendly visit?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.569
You came to watch.

42:13.948 --> 42:17.660
We just bombed Hyosan.

42:20.996 --> 42:21.830
What did you say?

42:22.706 --> 42:25.584
40% of Hyosan's population is dead.

42:28.754 --> 42:29.713
You're a murderer.

42:31.173 --> 42:34.343
How could you be so shameless?

42:40.140 --> 42:43.644
I thought about who would be able

42:45.437 --> 42:48.107
to comfort the people of Hyosan right now.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.443
That is why I came to see you.

42:52.611 --> 42:55.573
Please tell the people of Hyosan

42:57.283 --> 42:58.284
that I am sorry.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.054
JIN SEON-MOO

44:19.198 --> 44:20.115
This morning,

44:21.784 --> 44:23.869
I watched the last video made
by Lee Byeong-chan,

44:23.952 --> 44:27.748
the man who created this virus.

44:30.709 --> 44:33.003
He tried to save his wife and son

44:33.087 --> 44:35.339
who were infected with the virus,

44:36.298 --> 44:37.257
but he failed.

44:38.467 --> 44:39.968
And he made a final decision.

44:48.435 --> 44:49.520
Jin-su.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.440
Honey…

44:59.363 --> 45:02.116
I respect the decision
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan made.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.786
He was a father and a husband.

45:06.453 --> 45:10.040
I'm sure he couldn't kill anyone.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.878
However, I am a soldier.

45:16.922 --> 45:17.756
Today, I ordered

45:18.507 --> 45:20.884
the bombing of Hyosan.

45:22.261 --> 45:26.807
No one ordered me to do it.

45:27.808 --> 45:31.478
It was my sole decision
as the martial law commander.

45:33.355 --> 45:36.900
I take full responsibility.

46:00.215 --> 46:03.218
WIFE

46:06.305 --> 46:07.765
Hi, it's me.

46:09.099 --> 46:09.975
Did you eat?

46:11.727 --> 46:15.105
Come on. Look at the time.
Why haven't you eaten yet?

46:16.648 --> 46:17.691
What about the kids?

46:19.276 --> 46:20.110
Okay.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.947
What's the big deal about missing school?

46:24.448 --> 46:26.116
What matters is staying healthy.

46:27.075 --> 46:27.910
Yes.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.996
Look for a tutor.

46:31.830 --> 46:32.748
Yes.

46:33.707 --> 46:35.501
It's fine if they're expensive.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.215
Right. Not too expensive.

46:42.257 --> 46:43.217
Yes.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.180
God, honey.

46:50.599 --> 46:51.517
I miss you.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.436
What?

46:56.438 --> 46:57.689
I'm very sorry.

47:06.990 --> 47:07.991
I love you.

48:09.428 --> 48:11.221
WIFE: I'M SORRY I GOT CRANKY WITH YOU
I LOVE YOU TOO

48:11.305 --> 48:13.891
WHEN CAN YOU COME HOME?

49:30.133 --> 49:37.099
NAM ON-JO
