00:01.802 --> 00:04.430
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.130
TEAL'C: Gerak emerged as spokesperson

00:06.239 --> 00:09.231
for the more traditional ways
of the Jaffa High Council.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.037
Which he could control.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.606
CARTER: It's symbiote poison.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.045
The Trust Iaunched
at Ieast two poison attacks

00:15.148 --> 00:18.413
against Goa 'uld-occupied worlds
after we took back the gate.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.078
That means they had to leave
the relatively safe confines

00:21.188 --> 00:23.179
of the solar system,
and head out into the galaxy

00:23.290 --> 00:27.351
where they ran the risk
ofbeing killed or captured.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.219
You think they have been taken as hostage
and sent back to Earth.

00:30.330 --> 00:33.265
Any Goa'uld who got his hands on them
would've discovered pretty quickly

00:33.366 --> 00:35.800
that they belong
to a top secret organization

00:35.902 --> 00:38.462
with high-Ievel connections to some
of the most powerful governments

00:38.572 --> 00:40.472
and institutions on this planet.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.407
By now, the entire Trust
could have been taken over.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.549
(PANTING)

01:14.875 --> 01:16.001
(TIRES SCREECHING)

02:27.214 --> 02:29.409
The body was discovered this morning
on a remote road

02:29.516 --> 02:32.576
off lnterstate 77 in Virginia.
He was spotted by a passing motorist.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.654
Local authorities say
he'd been dead about a day or so.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.915
Probably the victim of a hit-and-run driver.

02:37.023 --> 02:41.050
What do we figure? This guy got lost,
and he was hitching a ride back to Chulak?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.686
His presence on Earth is a mystery to me.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.355
He was found literally
in the middle of nowhere

02:45.465 --> 02:47.160
about 3 miles north
of a little town called Edison,

02:47.267 --> 02:48.632
population 3,012.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.464
The symbol on his forehead indicates
that he was a servant of Lord Yu,

02:52.572 --> 02:54.631
many of whom now follow Gerak.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.837
Gerak might be able
to shed some light on this.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.705
-I will speak to him.
-Very well.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.940
Colonel Mitchell, you're with Teal'c.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.573
Dr. Jackson, I want you to dig up

03:04.684 --> 03:07.278
all the information you can
on Edison, Virginia.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.515
Colonel Carter will join you
as soon as she's settled in.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.093
Whoa, Sam, hey, come on.
Let me give you a hand.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.393
Thank you.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.629
So General Landry briefed me
on the circumstances

03:23.737 --> 03:27.571
-surrounding our mystery Jaffa.
-Yeah, I think I got something on that.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.803
-Farrow-Marshall?
-Yeah, you familiar with them?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.006
They're an aeronautics firm
headquartered in Bethesda,

03:35.115 --> 03:36.742
the Department of Defense
is their biggest client.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.580
Yeah, it turns out that their plant
in Virginia employed about 800 residents

03:39.686 --> 03:41.677
of Edison until it closed down
six months ago.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.949
Now, it's located just outside of town,

03:44.057 --> 03:47.049
and about a mile and a half
from where our dead Jaffa turned up.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.286
Really?

03:49.829 --> 03:52.059
Pardon the mess. I'm still unpacking.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.901
Farrow-Marshall.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.337
Let's see what they've been up to lately.

03:59.706 --> 04:00.968
Here we go.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.475
Their chief financial officer
went missing yesterday morning.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.374
-lnteresting timing.
-Yeah.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.539
According to his wife, he left for
a business meeting in Richmond, Virginia,

04:09.649 --> 04:11.116
and never came back.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.424
GERAK: Make no mistake, brothers.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.494
The Tok'ra only wish to meet with us
because they fear us.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.860
We defeated the Goa'uld and took
their mother ships and strongholds.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.100
Now, we are our own masters.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.603
I needn't remind the Council
that the Tok'ra did battle

04:32.706 --> 04:35.072
with the Goa'uld for just as many years.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.344
Their efforts were instrumental
in securing our freedom.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.878
Let us all be clear.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.981
The only motivation that a Tok'ra has

04:43.083 --> 04:46.712
is their own selfish needs,
not to help any of us.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.084
Then what do you suggest, Gerak?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.783
That we use our newfound strength
to take what we want.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.890
That we emulate our former oppressors.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.198
Brothers and sisters,

05:04.571 --> 05:09.406
we finally have the opportunity
to govern with authority and respect.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.840
Years ago, that seemed unthinkable.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.276
But now we are in a position
to help others

05:15.382 --> 05:18.010
who are in need
of our support and guidance.

05:18.118 --> 05:21.246
-Why should we help them?
-How about because

05:21.688 --> 05:23.485
it's the right thing to do?

05:23.990 --> 05:27.391
Look, whatever your differences
with the Tok'ra in the past,

05:27.494 --> 05:28.825
it's time to move on.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.522
Teal'c's right. You kicked ass.
You're sitting pretty.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.064
Don't get hung up...

05:34.467 --> 05:37.265
Outsiders are not permitted
to address the Council.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.342
Never mind.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.447
I caution you all.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.818
We have fought too long and too hard
to entrust our future to the Tok'ra.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.756
Or the Tau'ri for that matter.

05:58.124 --> 06:02.083
Brothers and sisters, I suggest
we bring this assembly to an end.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.222
Let us consider what we've discussed
and reconvene in the morning.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.593
Very well.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.677
Gerak, a word.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.708
(CHUCKLING)

06:27.821 --> 06:31.587
Teal'c. Welcome back to Dakara.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.053
Your presence is sorely missed.

06:35.628 --> 06:40.156
What draws you away
from your Tau'ri home?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.060
A Jaffa was discovered on Earth. Dead.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.766
Strange.

06:46.873 --> 06:50.775
-But what has that got to do with me?
-He was a servant of Lord Yu's

06:50.877 --> 06:53.402
and, I assumed, a follower of yours.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.111
Well, that may be.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.013
But I don't seem to recognize him.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.455
Nor do I know what he's doing on Earth.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.360
My obligation to the Council
requires my presence elsewhere.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.326
I'm sure you understand.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.744
He is lying to us.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.781
No kidding.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.463
It was about six months ago
when he started acting strangely.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.332
What do you mean, strangely?

07:51.704 --> 07:53.399
Cold, distant.

07:53.506 --> 07:56.600
You've gotta understand,
Alex has always been incredibly focused

07:56.709 --> 07:58.336
when it comes to his job.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.277
At first I just assumed
he had a lot on his plate.

08:01.381 --> 08:05.215
But after a couple of weeks
it became clear that it was more than that.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.116
I started to suspect
he might be having an affair.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.790
So I hired a private investigator
and I had him followed.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.091
And what did the investigator find out?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.360
I'm not sure, exactly.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.898
But a couple of days
after accepting the job, he quit,

08:24.003 --> 08:27.996
returned all of my money and
strongly suggested that I drop the matter.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.870
He didn't offer you
any kind of explanation?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.672
No. But it was obvious he was scared.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.939
He did some surveillance
in his first two days.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.142
These are the photos that he took.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.615
He asked for them back
after a couple of days,

08:41.721 --> 08:44.986
right after he dropped the case,
but I refused.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.357
I offered them to the police,
but they didn't think the photos

08:48.461 --> 08:50.725
were pertinent to their investigation.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.162
My husband wasn't having an affair.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.894
But he was clearly involved in something
that he wanted to keep secret.

08:57.003 --> 09:00.234
-Do you mind if we hold on to these?
-No, go ahead.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.657
He still refuses to speak?

09:23.997 --> 09:26.090
The prisoner is strong.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.666
Then we must be stronger, Yat'Yir.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.332
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

09:34.707 --> 09:38.336
It was through instruments like this
we were oppressed.

09:39.012 --> 09:43.915
And how appropriate would it be, then,
for it to be used to serve our cause.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.026
You will surrender your secrets.

09:56.462 --> 10:01.092
Of that I am sure.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.376
Colonel Carter? Charlotte Mayfield.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.081
VP here at Farrow-Marshall.
How can I help you?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.717
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about your plant in Virginia.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.028
-lt was shut down six months ago.
-Officially, yes.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.563
But we went by to check it out

10:32.665 --> 10:35.828
and it looked like it had been cleaned out
very recently.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.028
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.571
Some of the residents of Edison
claim they saw trucks

10:40.673 --> 10:43.506
traveling to and from the plant
a couple of nights ago.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.076
They're mistaken.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.646
So you're saying no one's been in the area
for several months?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.647
Well, I can't speak for the locals,

10:49.749 --> 10:53.651
but certainly no one from Farrow-Marshall
would have any reason to go there.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.152
How about Richmond?

10:57.290 --> 11:00.157
Anyone from Farrow-Marshall
have reason to go there?

11:01.427 --> 11:03.987
According to his wife,
Alex Jameson was on his way

11:04.097 --> 11:05.792
to Richmond, Virginia,
when he went missing.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.525
We've cooperated
with the local authorities

11:07.633 --> 11:10.932
on Mr. Jameson's disappearance.
You may wanna consult with them.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.766
Who was Mr. Jameson meeting with
that day?

11:12.872 --> 11:13.998
I'm sorry,

11:14.107 --> 11:17.372
company policy prevents me
from discussing that with you.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.075
Your CFO is missing.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.981
Now I would think
that you would want to do

11:24.083 --> 11:25.778
everything within your power
to help find him.

11:25.885 --> 11:26.874
Oh, I do.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.784
As I said, we're cooperating
with the authorities.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.091
Now if you'll excuse me,
I think we're done here.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.693
These gentlemen will show you out.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.860
If you have any further questions,
feel free to fax them to the head office.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.157
You can be sure that's not the end of it.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.086
Of course not.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.529
We've only just begun.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.837
JACKSON: I coordinated with Kerry
Johnson and the ClA's investigation

12:20.940 --> 12:22.498
into the N.I.D.-Trust connection.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.304
We've done a little digging and managed
to put names to some of the faces

12:25.411 --> 12:27.345
from the photographs
Sheila Jameson provided.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.245
That's David Ballard,
Chairman of the Stark Consortium.

12:30.349 --> 12:33.648
This is Masato Hiro,
CEO, Far East Mercantile.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.015
James Lowery and Tony Tran,

12:35.121 --> 12:38.522
President and Chief Financial Officer,
Alaraph Pharmaceuticals.

12:38.624 --> 12:43.118
This one is Michael Northrop,
CEO and founder of Hammel Technologies.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.163
Now, all the individuals we've managed
to identify so far

12:45.264 --> 12:47.858
are major players in the areas
of business and high finance.

12:47.967 --> 12:51.403
Very powerful, very influential,
and in the case of these two,

12:51.504 --> 12:53.665
-very missing.
-Missing?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.400
Terrence Evans and William Blaylock,

12:55.508 --> 12:57.442
founding partners
of Procyon Media Enterprises.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.569
They went missing about six months ago,
coincidentally around the same time

13:00.680 --> 13:02.375
we managed to destroy the Osiris ' ship.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.541
You see a possible
Goa'uld connection here?

13:04.650 --> 13:06.083
Well, we already know
that sometime last year

13:06.185 --> 13:07.584
the Goa'uld successfully infiltrated
the Trust.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.052
And I know that the Trust has connections

13:09.155 --> 13:10.986
to government agencies
and corporations worldwide.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.421
There's a good chance
we didn't get them all,

13:12.525 --> 13:15.187
and if that's the case,
the Goa'uld are still on Earth

13:15.294 --> 13:17.125
and they're gaining strength.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.239
Let me guess,
they didn't know anything either.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.243
As Gerak grows stronger,
few Jaffa risk defying him

13:37.350 --> 13:39.011
for fear of retribution.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.320
We must leave Dakara
and seek our answers elsewhere.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.821
KA'LEL: The answers you seek are on Earth.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.491
What do you know of the Jaffa
we discovered?

13:55.601 --> 13:58.593
He lost his life
trying to secure Gerak's prize.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.569
Of what prize do you speak?

14:00.673 --> 14:01.799
Ba'al.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.069
Ba'al is on Earth?

14:05.177 --> 14:08.044
That is where he sought refuge
immediately following his defeat

14:08.147 --> 14:09.808
in the battle for Dakara.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.180
He has been there ever since.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.885
LANDRY: You're telling me a member
of the Jaffa High Council

14:17.990 --> 14:21.892
claims that Ba'al has been here on Earth
for the better part of the last nine months?

14:21.994 --> 14:24.724
-Yes, sir.
-ls there any chance she may be right?

14:24.830 --> 14:28.630
My information suggests that Ba'al
has been hiding in the Archeva system.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.601
He has been sighted there
as recently as a week ago.

14:32.138 --> 14:36.006
So the Council member is either lying
or she's a victim of bad intelligence.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.700
Not all bad, sir.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.109
They knew enough to look for Ba'al
at a Trust-operated facility.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.374
If he were on Earth
that would be the best place to start.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.780
If the Jaffa genuinely believe
Ba'al to be on Earth

14:45.885 --> 14:49.082
-they will continue to search for him.
-Well, that's obviously unacceptable.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.349
Tell the Council we've begun
our own investigation.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.288
If he's here, we'll find him.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.156
It would not be in Gerak's best interest
to allow that to happen.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.251
Why?

14:57.363 --> 14:59.058
Ba'al's capture would be
a big moral victory

14:59.165 --> 15:01.565
as well as a huge political gain
for whoever brings him in.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.831
Should Gerak be successful, he would
win the hearts of many undecided Jaffa,

15:05.938 --> 15:08.771
thereby assuring undisputed influence
over the Council.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.138
So all we have to do
is find Ba'al before they do.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.234
Yeah, but Gerak has a head start.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.576
The fact that
the company CFO went missing

15:15.681 --> 15:17.342
around the same time
that the Jaffa was killed.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.214
You think Jameson was at the plant
when they came looking for Ba'al.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.913
In which case,
he may well have been captured.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.758
He has revealed Ba'al's location

15:36.869 --> 15:39.861
and the locations
of his various shelters on Earth.

15:42.174 --> 15:46.133
He should never have invented
such an effective means of torture.

15:53.719 --> 15:54.777
(DRONING)

16:01.761 --> 16:03.160
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

16:11.070 --> 16:12.560
MAN: Come on. Come on.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.066
Yes!

16:18.077 --> 16:19.203
(STATIC BUZZING)

16:25.151 --> 16:27.449
Where is the false god, Ba'al?

16:32.258 --> 16:33.850
We've been compromised.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.898
(SCREAMING)

17:07.326 --> 17:09.021
They're five floors above us.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.062
I know. We're leaving.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.759
Hello?

17:17.036 --> 17:21.996
I'd like to report
a whole lot of shooting here, okay?

17:27.947 --> 17:29.778
-So?
-Those offices were a war zone.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.747
Staff weapons versus semi-automatics.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.284
-Who won?
-Hard to say.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.683
There was no bodies
and all the security footage was missing.

17:35.788 --> 17:36.880
-Witnesses?
-One.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.718
Some guy who was working overtime

17:38.824 --> 17:40.553
and spent most of the firefight
under his desk.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.991
But was able to provide a description
of three individuals.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.359
Big. Tattooed. Chain-mail pants.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.956
So, it's either our Jaffa
or KlSS is back on tour.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.504
I have something to show you.
We've just received this.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.267
AIthough it's a far cry

17:57.376 --> 17:58.644
from some of the better worlds
I've conquered in my days,

17:58.644 --> 17:59.668
from some of the better worlds
I've conquered in my days,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.679
this planet is not without its charm.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.181
-That's...
-Ba'al.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.979
In retrospect, I'm actually glad
we never succeeded in destroying it.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.021
That said,
Earth is not without its drawbacks.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.481
The foremost being
an alarming Iack ofprivacy.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.894
My ships ha ve been seized,
my armies vanquished.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.025
I no Ionger present a threat to this galaxy.

18:20.132 --> 18:23.226
AII I ask is to be Ieft alone
without ha ving to worry about you,

18:23.335 --> 18:26.463
the Jaffa, or any of my former enemies
coming after me.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.837
So, I'd Iike to offer the following deal.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.708
AIIow me to Iive out the rest of my days
here on Earth in peace,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.576
without interference.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.080
In exchange for my freedom,

18:39.885 --> 18:41.580
I will follow your Iaws.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.155
You will never ha ve cause
to fear me again.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.621
I hope we can put the past behind us.

18:47.860 --> 18:52.126
I certainly ha ve no desire to harm you
or anyone else on this world.

18:52.998 --> 18:56.957
That said, you should know
that I've placed a naquadah bomb

18:57.069 --> 18:59.037
somewhere in the United States.

18:59.505 --> 19:03.464
Consider it a precautionary measure.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.941
If another attempt is made to capture me,

19:07.046 --> 19:10.812
I promise you,
the consequences will be most dire.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.223
Of all the retirement destinations
he could choose

19:27.333 --> 19:29.494
he has to pick our planet.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.536
We have teams outfitted
with naquadah detectors

19:32.638 --> 19:36.130
in several major urban centers, but there's
no way we can cover the whole country.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.436
The Prometheus has instruments

19:37.543 --> 19:39.534
which can detect naquadah from orbit,
does it not?

19:39.645 --> 19:41.545
Yes, but so far
the scans have come up empty.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.978
So it could be a bluff.

19:43.082 --> 19:46.051
Or Ba'al may have found a way
to shield the bomb from our sensors.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.516
JACKSON: Bluffing or not,
he's still a threat.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.178
As de facto head of the Trust operations,

19:49.288 --> 19:51.586
he has the resources and capabilities
to do a lot of damage.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.679
Naquadah bomb or not.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.918
So, problem number one,
how do we find him?

19:55.027 --> 19:58.155
Problem number two, how do we take him
out without inflicting collateral damage?

19:58.264 --> 20:00.494
JACKSON: A good point.
Ba'al's probably surrounded by security,

20:00.599 --> 20:02.829
no doubt most of them human
with no knowledge of his true identity.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.130
If we go after him,
we risk injuring innocent people.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.967
Not if we use the symbiote poison
the Tok'ra developed.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.507
We already know
it won't harm human physiology.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.010
And with the right delivery system,
nothing but net. Nice.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.104
I'll contact R&D,
see what they can put together.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.740
Which leaves us
with problem number one.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.682
The N.I.D.'s running surveillance
on the individuals

20:20.786 --> 20:22.310
identified in the photographs
with Jameson.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.446
Hopefully, eventually one of them
will lead us to Ba'al.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.683
Of equal concern are Gerak's Jaffa.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.891
We have no control over them.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.896
If they decide to move on Ba'al,
Earth will face Ba'al's full reprisal.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.556
And I'm guessing

20:34.733 --> 20:37.361
those Jaffa aren't exactly kicking it back
at the local Denny's.

20:37.469 --> 20:41.098
Plus, isn't it a long, stinky ride
from Dakara in a cargo ship?

20:41.206 --> 20:42.332
Indeed.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.834
It is more likely
that Gerak has a mother ship

20:44.944 --> 20:47.071
somewhere in the vicinity of Earth.

20:47.546 --> 20:50.174
Well, if the Prometheus was going
to detect the naquadah from orbit,

20:50.282 --> 20:51.772
it would have done it by now.

20:51.884 --> 20:52.976
All right.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.950
I'll send them out
to look for the mother ship.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.488
Colonel Mitchell,
I want you and Teal'c on board.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.081
Colonel Carter, Dr. Jackson,
you coordinate with the N.I.D.

21:01.193 --> 21:04.492
In the event they locate Ba'al,
I want you there.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.770
Hey, wait up.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.987
All right. That's better.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.848
-Gentlemen, welcome aboard.
-Thank you, sir.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.645
-Any word from NORAD?
-SSN came up empty.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.481
Could the ship we're looking for
be cloaked?

22:01.587 --> 22:04.317
Mother ships do not possess
cloaking capabilities.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.653
Well, then, could we be looking
for another type of craft?

22:06.759 --> 22:08.124
It is possible.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.925
Whatever the target ship,
if it's out there, we'll find it.

22:20.305 --> 22:23.763
-Agent Barrett. Thanks for the lift.
-Well, I couldn't exactly have you guys

22:23.876 --> 22:26.003
catching a cab to the stakeout now,
could l?

22:26.111 --> 22:27.237
So, what's the latest?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.541
Well, one of our agents
following the Jameson lead

22:29.648 --> 22:32.014
spotted an individual
matching Ba'al's description

22:32.117 --> 22:35.109
at the Gilbride Hotel on 5th Street
about an hour ago.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.547
Looks like we got him.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.662
You picking up anything at all?
Unusual variances?

22:47.766 --> 22:50.257
-Anomalous energy readings?
-No, sir.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.197
You know, it's possible what we're
looking for isn't even out there.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.331
It is possible, but unlikely.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.137
If Gerak believed Ba'al to be on Earth,

22:58.243 --> 23:02.077
he would undoubtedly establish
a base of operations in planetary orbit.

23:02.614 --> 23:04.172
Great. So where is it?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.720
Hiding in plain sight.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.391
What was that?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.086
Right.

23:17.096 --> 23:21.157
Colonel Pendergast,
plot a course for the far side of the moon.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.594
Do it.

23:37.382 --> 23:40.044
-What's the situation?
-They're still inside.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.416
Room 1602. All the exits are covered.

23:42.521 --> 23:46.582
-We're just waiting for the green light.
-Dr. Jackson, you go with Williams.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.133
(CLEARING THROAT)

24:00.506 --> 24:03.498
-How have you been?
-Pretty good. You?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.839
Yeah, pretty good. Can't complain.

24:09.548 --> 24:10.606
What's new?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.247
Let's see,

24:13.585 --> 24:15.780
I was leading R&D for a while there.

24:17.356 --> 24:20.348
I never figured you the type
to settle for a desk job.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.324
I needed something
with more flexible hours.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.895
Janet's adopted daughter, Cassie,
was going through a hard time.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.021
Oh, I see.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.965
Spent some time on the Prometheus,
away on deep-space reconnaissance.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.636
Helped stop a dangerous new enemy
from gaining a foothold in the galaxy.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.639
Yes, I heard about that.

24:38.710 --> 24:39.870
How's Pete?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.108
We broke up.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.009
Really?

24:48.320 --> 24:52.051
-I mean, I'm sorry to hear that.
-It's the best thing for both of us.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.217
So you're single again.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.459
Not exactly.

25:06.705 --> 25:07.865
(DRONING)

25:09.374 --> 25:11.899
Sir, I'm picking up
a large energy signature.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.274
-Lock on target.
-MARKS: Target locked.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.881
Sir, we're receiving a communication
from the mother ship.

25:23.488 --> 25:24.887
Let's see it.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.287
(BEEPING)

25:29.928 --> 25:33.056
Withdraw, or we will be forced
to defend ourselves.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.633
Sorry. We're not going anywhere.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.577
Come on, where are they?

25:52.751 --> 25:54.685
BARRETT ON RADIO: Abort.
AII agents abort.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.750
-What's going on?
-He's not inside.

25:57.856 --> 26:01.087
If we move now,
we risk compromising the operation.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.105
Barrett, you better be
damn sure about this.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.045
We're sure.
Let them go and come to the van.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.513
(DOOR OPENING)

26:30.689 --> 26:32.623
-Sam.
-lt wasn't him.

26:32.991 --> 26:36.256
-How do you know?
-Because he can't be in two places at once.

26:36.361 --> 26:39.888
Ba'al is across town right now
doing a live television interview.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.129
-What?
-Thank you, that's a very good question.

26:43.235 --> 26:48.468
My acquisition ofHammel Technologies
and its subsidiaries is just a first step

26:48.573 --> 26:54.307
in a Iong-range venture that will ultimately
see a consolidation and a streamlining

26:54.613 --> 26:57.207
of what is presently a dissolute market.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.078
No doubt most of you
ha ve never heard of me before today.

27:00.185 --> 27:03.416
Well, I can assure you
that over the next few months

27:03.522 --> 27:05.786
you will all get to know me very well.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.221
And I Iook forward to it.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.462
This is Colonel Pendergast
of the Earth ship Prometheus

27:19.571 --> 27:21.300
asking you to stand down.

27:21.406 --> 27:26.503
We have no desire to engage in battle,
but we will not withdraw our forces.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.273
Look, we know why you're here.

27:29.748 --> 27:33.912
Then you also know that I have no choice
but to maintain my present position.

27:34.019 --> 27:35.714
Okay, FYl,

27:36.021 --> 27:39.252
we're not gonna let you put
any more men on the planet's surface.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.850
If you fire on our ship,
we will defend ourselves.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.191
TEAL'C: Yat'Yir, hear me.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.391
You and your Jaffa are at a disadvantage,

27:48.500 --> 27:51.094
knowing neither territory
nor its inhabitants.

27:51.536 --> 27:53.902
Allow us to assist you
in apprehending Ba'al.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.565
We can both lay claim to his capture.

27:56.742 --> 28:00.200
Then all Jaffa can declare freedom
and celebrate as one.

28:00.312 --> 28:04.874
I'm afraid we are past the point where
our differences can be settled so readily.

28:05.784 --> 28:06.842
I'm sorry, Teal'c.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.481
(CLEARING THROAT)

28:12.324 --> 28:14.986
Meanwhile, they've still got boots
on the ground.

28:15.093 --> 28:16.958
Nothing we can do about that.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.786
Perhaps we can.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.966
-Can, how?
-By forcing Gerak's hand.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.339
Yes, sir.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.579
Our orders are to stay put
for the time being.

28:37.682 --> 28:38.876
You've got to be kidding me.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.645
Come on, we know where he is.
We've got him.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.653
Yes, Ba'al has made it easier for us
to pinpoint his location.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.588
But unfortunately, by going public
he's made it more difficult for us

28:46.691 --> 28:48.556
to take him down quickly and covertly.

28:48.660 --> 28:52.187
We make a move against him now
and we risk a media circus.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.524
Unless, of course, you feel like giving
the American people a Stargate primer.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.499
And then there's also the little matter
of a naquadah bomb

28:57.602 --> 28:59.695
sitting somewhere
in the continental United States.

28:59.805 --> 29:00.863
Yeah.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.033
Okay. Okay, we'll stay.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.472
The General's consulting
with the Pentagon

29:05.577 --> 29:08.011
to determine
what our next move should be.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.874
TEAL'C: If there is one thing a Jaffa values
above all else, it is his pride.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.418
When the other Council members discover

29:15.520 --> 29:17.249
that Gerak has not been
completely forthcoming,

29:17.355 --> 29:19.585
they will turn against him
and force his hand.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.319
Gerak must be shamed
into removing his forces from Earth.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.485
It is the only way.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.529
Your turf, your rules, brother.

29:26.665 --> 29:31.398
No matter how far we must travel,
no matter how long it will take,

29:33.038 --> 29:35.939
our former enemies
must pay for their crimes.

29:36.341 --> 29:39.401
This, I promise you.
That we will destroy them.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.079
Not only just in memory
of those who have fallen,

29:43.348 --> 29:47.375
but in honor of those
who survived to enjoy their freedom.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.477
You speak of honor, Gerak.

29:50.288 --> 29:54.190
Yet you disrespect this Council
by dishonoring it with your lies.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.351
I have not lied to this Council.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.661
It is you that I have purposely misled,

30:00.365 --> 30:04.233
for fear that your commitment
to the cause is suspect.

30:04.336 --> 30:08.670
Even as we speak, Gerak's followers
are hunting Ba'al on Earth.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.570
Of this we are well aware.

30:11.009 --> 30:14.308
GERAK: I had wished to inform the Council
sooner, but I dared not

30:14.412 --> 30:17.472
for fear that the elements
sympathetic to the Tau'ri

30:17.582 --> 30:19.607
would learn about Ba'al's whereabouts.

30:19.718 --> 30:21.618
You dare question my loyalty?

30:21.953 --> 30:24.478
Your loyalty is not under question, Teal'c.

30:24.589 --> 30:27.251
You have done more than anyone
to help secure our freedom

30:27.359 --> 30:29.190
and for that we are ever grateful.

30:29.294 --> 30:34.596
However, your allegiance to the Tau'ri
presents you with a difficult dilemma.

30:34.699 --> 30:39.193
Even as we speak, your Tau'ri ships
prevent us from pursuing the enemy.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.043
As you have said, Ka'lel,

30:47.479 --> 30:51.279
I accomplished much in our long struggle
against our former oppressors,

30:51.383 --> 30:53.977
but only because of the support
of the Tau'ri.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.745
Their commitment
was as unwavering as my own.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.851
And now you would repay them by
surreptitiously stealing upon their world,

31:01.960 --> 31:05.726
putting their people, to say nothing
of the Stargate program, at risk!

31:08.733 --> 31:10.724
They are our allies.

31:11.136 --> 31:14.264
Rather than dishonor them
by trespassing onto their world,

31:14.372 --> 31:16.840
respect them enough
to tell them the truth.

31:17.108 --> 31:20.635
Ask for their assistance in capturing Ba'al.
They will help us.

31:21.179 --> 31:23.670
But will they?

31:24.115 --> 31:27.710
They are as determined to have Ba'al
answer for his crimes, as are we.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.946
But if they succeed...

31:30.055 --> 31:31.784
Then he will be brought
before this Council

31:31.890 --> 31:34.154
where he will face his proper punishment!

31:34.259 --> 31:35.658
You have my word.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.160
What the hell are you thinking?
There ain't no guarantee

31:46.271 --> 31:48.637
the US Government
is going to give them Ba'al.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.072
It was only to give Gerak pause
before his next attack

31:51.176 --> 31:52.768
against Ba'al on Earth.

31:52.877 --> 31:56.005
Even so, we may have only gained
a brief respite.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.213
(METALLIC GRATING)

32:04.522 --> 32:06.513
Satellite tracking has placed Ba'al

32:06.625 --> 32:10.186
in a remote, heavily guarded compound
west of the city.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.892
From the site of the press conference
directly to his present location,

32:13.999 --> 32:15.330
he took no evasive maneuvers,

32:15.433 --> 32:18.766
made absolutely no attempt
to disguise his movements.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.472
TEAL'C: Clearly, he's emboldened
by the belief

32:22.574 --> 32:25.941
that you would not dare attack him now
that he has made himself a public figure.

32:26.044 --> 32:29.138
I've had Walter patch in
Colonel Carter and Dr. Jackson.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.411
Everybody up to date?

32:31.683 --> 32:34.083
We have a cruise missile prepped
with symbiote poison

32:34.185 --> 32:35.812
and ready to Iaunch on your command.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.185
General, I recommend we launch now.
It may be the last chance we get.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.281
What ifhe isn 't bluffing
about the naquadah bomb?

32:41.393 --> 32:44.089
Then we'll have stopped him
before he has a chance to plant any more.

32:44.195 --> 32:46.629
We'II have to come up with a cover story.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.659
Wouldn't be the first time.

32:48.767 --> 32:53.067
We must strike now, before Ba'al
realizes his strategy has backfired.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.904
And the Council?

32:55.907 --> 32:59.070
I merely promised
he would be delivered if captured.

32:59.177 --> 33:02.169
If he is killed, then there is no difficulty.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.622
Right. Good work.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.461
-What's the news?
-Stargate Command intends to attack.

33:25.203 --> 33:28.229
-How can you be certain?
-The humans that set up the Trust

33:28.339 --> 33:32.241
were in a position to infiltrate much
of the secure communications network

33:32.343 --> 33:34.470
employed by this government.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.174
How clever of them.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.219
-You got something else for me, Walter?
-Yes, sir.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.188
We just got this sent to us.

33:47.625 --> 33:51.459
You have chosen not to heed my warning,
and so forced my hand.

33:52.297 --> 33:55.425
There is a bomb in the Halcyon Tower
in downtown Seattle.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.034
It will detonate
at exactly 1:30 p.m. Iocal time.

33:59.571 --> 34:03.735
Call off your strike on my Iocation
and I will defuse the device.

34:05.443 --> 34:10.403
Defy me, and this will be just
the first of many such demonstrations.

Forty-five minutes.

34:14.285 --> 34:17.914

34:23.695 --> 34:25.856
Yes, sir. Understood, sir.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.923
Agent Barrett, have your men tighten
their perimeter around the compound.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.433
No one in or out.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.333
Daniel, once the missile hits,
you'll have to go in

34:33.438 --> 34:34.871
and make sure we have a confirmed kill.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.339
-Why? Where are you gonna be?
-Seattle.

-Prometheus.

We're unable to get a fix on its location.

Multiple signals. Is it possible
there's more than one device?

35:19.184 --> 35:20.947
Well, we're not sure.

and destroy the equipment.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.528
I want nothing left.

-The Jaffa. They found us.
-Time to go.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.980
Colonel Carter and her team are still
searching. No sign of the bomb yet.

35:51.382 --> 35:54.840
Sir, Dr. Jackson reports Jaffa
at the target site.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.447
They've engaged the compound guards.

Let's not hesitate, General Landry.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.425
Launch the missile.

36:07.765 --> 36:10.461
Yes, sir. Launching Alpha Two.

36:20.645 --> 36:24.172
It doesn't make any sense.
It's like there's naquadah everywhere.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.711
How old is this building?

36:27.252 --> 36:29.345
It's brand new. It just went up last month.

to Stargate Command, now.

-Colonel, did you find the bomb?
-CARTER: Sort of.

36:40.598 --> 36:41.758
What's that supposed to mean?

36:41.866 --> 36:44.266
Readings indicate
the entire superstructure of the building

36:44.369 --> 36:45.529
is laced with naquadah.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.572
It was built that way.
Ba'al's been planning this for a long time.

36:48.673 --> 36:53.372
-I'm not sure I understand, Colonel.
-The bomb isn't in the building, sir.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.013
The bomb is the building.

on the location.

are moving in to secure the area.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.666
Sam, that naquadah
ain't gonna go up on its own.

-There's gotta be a detonator there.
-I agree, but it could be anywhere.

37:23.141 --> 37:26.269

We'd never find it in time.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.807
How much progress have you made
on the evacuation?

37:28.913 --> 37:30.141
We've cleared a five-block radius,

37:30.248 --> 37:33.513
but when this thing goes off,
a five-mile radius isn't going to be enough.

you can do about that now.

-Because you disregarded my warnings.

Because your rash actions
not only allowed Ba'al to escape,

Yes, you may muse
about what might have been.

we secured Ba'al's compound
and searched the premises.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.197
In the basement we discovered
a lab containing equipment and data

40:38.302 --> 40:39.997
related to genetic replication.

40:40.104 --> 40:44.234
It's very possible the Ba'al you saw die
in Dakara was just a clone.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.841
The real Ba'al could still be out there.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.413

41:02.560 --> 41:03.584
No.

41:04.228 --> 41:07.129

would seem little more than an attempt

to tarnish Gerak's hard-fought victory.

in downtown Seattle.

41:42.033 --> 41:45.935

at approximately 12:45 this afternoon

41:46.037 --> 41:49.734

were dispatched to the scene.

41:50.374 --> 41:52.137

41:52.243 --> 41:55.076
and the building and surrounding areas
were evacuated.

were permitted to return to the area,

41:58.649 --> 42:01.083
all that remained was a heap of rubble.

42:02.153 --> 42:05.418
Surrounded as it was by taller high-rises,

42:05.523 --> 42:08.321
there were no eyewitnesses
to the building's destruction.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.792
No one saw or heard the explosion,

42:10.895 --> 42:13.796
