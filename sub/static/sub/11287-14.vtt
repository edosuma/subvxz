11:13.873 --> 11:15.940
and, and don't talk to anybody.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.340
In fact, you know, you'll really
get a feel of the place

11:18.406 --> 11:19.773
if you just stand
right outside that door.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.906
[chuckles]
Oh.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.506
(Otto)
'Places, everyone!'

11:22.573 --> 11:24.873
Oh, this is so exciting!

11:24.940 --> 11:28.573
(Otto)
'And action!'

11:28.640 --> 11:32.973
It seems that one of my
fine fellow Palo Altoens

11:33.040 --> 11:37.873
planted an exploding crouton
in my spinach salad.

11:37.940 --> 11:40.740
Care to comment,
Brooksie Fuller

11:40.806 --> 11:44.940
doorman at the Palo Alto
Spa, Hotel And Golf Resort?

11:45.006 --> 11:47.340
Hate to disappoint you,
Mayor Pond

11:47.406 --> 11:49.440
but your wife did it.

11:49.506 --> 11:51.106
How would you know that?

11:51.173 --> 11:54.406
Unless you were still
sleeping with her.

11:54.473 --> 11:57.973
You're right,
but you're also wrong.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.713
I'm not sleeping
with your wife, Charlene

12:00.780 --> 12:03.913
I'm sleeping with Jolene,
your dead wife.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.913
[instrumental music]

12:07.213 --> 12:09.446
(Otto)
'And we're clear!'

12:12.046 --> 12:13.980
[screaming]

12:15.746 --> 12:20.113
So, you‐you know Regine,
the wardrobe woman who cast you?

12:20.180 --> 12:21.613
‐ Who?
‐ Regine.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.680
‐ 'Who's Regine?'
‐ That's my friend.

12:22.746 --> 12:24.313
‐ My friend, Regine
‐ Synclaire.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.380
What did I tell you?

12:26.446 --> 12:27.813
I was talking
to a couple of the actors

12:27.880 --> 12:30.446
and nobody seems to know you.

12:30.513 --> 12:32.913
Well, that's 'cause most of them
have such big drinking problems

12:32.980 --> 12:34.713
that they don't even know
who they are.

12:34.780 --> 12:35.713
Oh.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.880
Oh, there's Otto Pharr again.

12:38.946 --> 12:40.446
You know,
I‐I'm gonna talk to him

12:40.513 --> 12:41.780
and give him my resume, okay?

12:41.846 --> 12:43.913
Wait! Um, let me do it.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.646
Uh, he's a bit eccentric
about the height

12:45.713 --> 12:46.913
of the people
that he speaks with.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.680
‐ Oh.
‐ Stay. And I mean stay.

12:49.746 --> 12:51.046
Okay.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.380
‐ What did I tell you here?
‐ I'll take a note on it, okay?

12:55.446 --> 12:58.413
‐ Okay, the note is ready?
‐ I'm on my way.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.520
I'm on my way.

13:00.586 --> 13:02.220
Will you have your people
call my people?

13:02.286 --> 13:03.986
I'm sorry,
but I'm‐I'm on a break.

13:04.053 --> 13:05.220
I'm not listening,
I'm not listening

13:05.286 --> 13:07.520
I'm eating, I'm eating my lunch.

13:10.020 --> 13:13.020
He says that now is not a good
time to interview actresses

13:13.086 --> 13:14.953
and he finds your height
disturbing.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.253
But he will definitely
keep you in mind

13:16.320 --> 13:18.253
the next time
he's casting your type.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.720
Oh, well, that's great.
Um, what's my type?

13:21.786 --> 13:23.653
Remember the best friend
in "Flashdance?"

13:23.720 --> 13:25.486
‐ Uh, no.
‐ That's your type.

13:25.553 --> 13:26.986
‐ Okay. Thanks very much.
‐ You're welcome.

13:28.453 --> 13:29.753
Mr. Pharr..

13:32.086 --> 13:33.386
Hi.

13:33.453 --> 13:35.120
I'm, uh, I'm Regine's roommate

13:35.186 --> 13:37.486
and I just wanna thank you so
much for your consideration.

13:37.553 --> 13:39.886
I'm gonna go out tonight
and rent "Flashdance."

13:39.953 --> 13:43.653
Again I ask, who is Regine?

13:43.720 --> 13:45.420
Oh, you're gonna run that joke
into the ground.

13:45.486 --> 13:47.320
[laughs]

13:47.386 --> 13:48.620
Oh, no, it's no joke.

13:48.686 --> 13:51.653
Hey, does anyone here know
who Regine is?

13:53.986 --> 13:55.920
Right there.

13:55.986 --> 13:58.820
Oh, the odor eater girl.

13:58.886 --> 14:01.660
Come here.
I forgot to give you this one.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.026
Thank you.
You should have said so.

14:09.260 --> 14:12.493
Um, um, uh, Regine,
you know something

14:12.560 --> 14:15.193
I must be in your way here.
You are just so busy.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.860
Girl, I'm gonna see you at home
later on, okay?

14:17.926 --> 14:19.260
Okay, okay, bye.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.460
Ooh. Halle Berry
is JFK's lovechild.

14:30.593 --> 14:33.460
Baltimore Browns.
It sounds stupid.

14:33.526 --> 14:35.493
I'm telling you, man.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.726
Hey, what's up, Khadijah?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.226
Well, you know, if they had a‐‐

14:38.293 --> 14:41.460
Uh! Uh‐uh‐uh!

14:41.526 --> 14:42.960
‐ Uh‐uh.
‐ What?

14:44.926 --> 14:46.460
Where are you going?

14:46.526 --> 14:48.260
Hey, we just thought
we'd pull up a chair

14:48.326 --> 14:50.493
and mangle some of that
leftover meatloaf.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.493
Can you please make it to go?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.293
I finally have the house
to myself.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.300
Just you and the "Man‐eating
mushrooms in Kansas?"

15:01.433 --> 15:04.866
Look, I deal
with the facts all day.

15:04.933 --> 15:07.400
Plus, they said
the farmer's wife is missing.

15:07.466 --> 15:08.766
Hmm.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.433
Alright, cool.
We'll get the meatloaf

15:10.500 --> 15:12.633
we get some Cajun rice,
we get some A1 sauce

15:12.700 --> 15:14.300
we get some hot sauce.
Mm, boy.

15:15.133 --> 15:17.233
Khadijah?

15:17.300 --> 15:19.666
I did some fine‐tuning
on this article.

15:19.733 --> 15:22.633
I even put in that comma
you suggested

15:22.700 --> 15:23.966
in a different spot.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.666
I'm sure it's fine.
I'll read it tomorrow.

15:27.733 --> 15:31.066
No, tomorrow it'll cool off,
right now it's hot.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.933
Listen to this.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.866
"The American justice system
has been on trial recently

15:35.933 --> 15:38.766
"with the high profile cases
of the rich and famous.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.233
"The judicial process has been
placed under scrutiny

15:41.300 --> 15:43.033
"thanks to the celebrated
lawsuits

15:43.100 --> 15:45.466
"of the wealthy
and the well‐known.

15:45.533 --> 15:48.100
But most Americans.."
What the hell are you doing?

15:49.666 --> 15:51.266
I'm just making a note.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.500
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, Max

15:52.566 --> 15:54.866
I believe I know
what Khadijah just jotted down.

15:54.933 --> 15:58.133
Baby, you have to use simple,
down‐to‐earth words.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.140
That way your article will be
less odious and pernicious

16:01.206 --> 16:02.940
and far more mellifluous.

16:05.073 --> 16:10.006
Kyle, nobody cares
that you got 1420 on your SATs.

16:11.973 --> 16:13.773
It's just that

16:13.840 --> 16:17.140
wealthy and well‐known
sound a little corny.

16:17.206 --> 16:21.240
Starting two words with the same
letter is catchy and contagious.

16:21.306 --> 16:23.673
It's‐it's‐it's resonant
and it's rhythmic.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.506
It's funky and I'm fixin' it.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.573
You know, you're no editor.
You're a pencil‐whipping freak.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.006
You know,
and you're a prima donna

16:32.073 --> 16:33.706
with a chip on your shoulder

16:33.773 --> 16:35.640
and a ketchup stain
on your shirt.

16:35.706 --> 16:37.073
Made you look.

16:38.306 --> 16:39.973
‐ Khadijah, you are the most‐‐
‐ Oh, you‐‐

16:40.040 --> 16:41.473
Excuse me, excuse me, but do you

16:41.540 --> 16:43.973
really need this, uh,
second sentence?

16:44.040 --> 16:44.973
What?

16:45.040 --> 16:45.973
Well, I think if you just

16:46.040 --> 16:47.106
get rid of this whole sentence

16:47.173 --> 16:49.373
the rest of it flows
quite nicely.

16:53.773 --> 16:58.706
‐ That is sharper.
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

16:58.773 --> 17:01.346
And gets me to the third
sentence on the page

17:01.413 --> 17:02.780
which is my favorite.

17:04.113 --> 17:06.680
And I said the same thing
five minutes ago.

17:06.746 --> 17:09.445
Excuse me
for being sesquipedalian.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.113
Kyle, tell me you know
what that means.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.012
[laughing]

17:19.813 --> 17:21.146
Look it up.

17:29.213 --> 17:31.080
I thought you went home.

17:31.146 --> 17:33.646
Well, um, I was at the bus stop,
and I noticed

17:33.713 --> 17:35.980
that the drug store was having
a sale on odor eaters

17:36.046 --> 17:38.180
and Mr. Pharr seems
like the kind of man

17:38.246 --> 17:39.513
that goes through a lot of them.

17:41.313 --> 17:44.013
By the way, um

17:44.080 --> 17:46.980
your real status here,
i‐it's our little secret.

17:47.046 --> 17:48.213
[scoffs]
Great.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.213
If there's anything I don't need
is pity from a woman

17:50.280 --> 17:53.080
who buys her clothes and
groceries from the same place.

17:56.146 --> 17:59.313
Usually when someone gets caught
in a web of lies

17:59.380 --> 18:02.320
they feel shame and guilt,
but not you, Regine.

18:02.386 --> 18:05.220
You go to your favorite place,
dissing my outfits.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.453
I'm sorry.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.420
About dogging my outfit?

18:11.486 --> 18:13.053
No, I hate that outfit.

18:14.853 --> 18:17.853
I'm sorry I led you to believe I
could do something for you here.

18:19.653 --> 18:22.853
I just don't understand
why you lied.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.286
I don't know.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.653
I guess I've spent
so much of my life

18:26.720 --> 18:31.986
creating this fabulous image
that it's a hard habit to break.

18:32.053 --> 18:33.486
Yeah, well, you do
always make your life

18:33.553 --> 18:35.686
sound like some grand movie.

18:35.753 --> 18:40.086
"Regine,"
starring Regine as Regine.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.753
And you know what the truth is?

18:42.820 --> 18:45.686
I really am okay
with what I'm doing.

18:45.753 --> 18:47.120
It's like

18:47.186 --> 18:50.720
when the creases on the mayor's
pants are razor sharp

18:50.786 --> 18:52.720
then I feel like
I've done my small part

18:52.786 --> 18:55.620
in entertaining
13 million people.

18:55.686 --> 18:58.786
Well, 15 million
if there's an evil twin.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.926
But..

19:00.993 --> 19:02.760
And I can't believe
I'm saying this..

19:04.926 --> 19:06.626
...I'm a grunt, and I love it.

19:08.293 --> 19:11.493
You just need to stop worrying
about what people say about you.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.160
I mean, look at me, I don't give
a damn what people say.

19:16.693 --> 19:18.060
Clearly.

19:19.393 --> 19:20.760
What? Are people
saying bad things?

19:20.826 --> 19:21.960
‐ What are they saying about me?
‐ No, no, no!

19:22.026 --> 19:23.560
Girl, no! No!

19:24.793 --> 19:26.493
No.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.093
Not everybody.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.326
Hey, what happened?
I just pressed that.

19:32.393 --> 19:34.893
Well, one of the extras
patted Otto on the head

19:34.960 --> 19:37.426
and said, "Thanks for the gig,
small fry."

19:37.493 --> 19:38.926
[snaps fingers]
Fired on the spot.

19:41.526 --> 19:44.426
Hey, um, if we threw somebody
into that wardrobe quickly

19:44.493 --> 19:45.693
you think we can get them on?

19:45.760 --> 19:47.560
Yeah, but they're setting up
that shot right now.

19:48.693 --> 19:49.726
Synclaire, you're on.

19:49.793 --> 19:52.060
Oh, my chance, my chance,
my chance!

19:52.126 --> 19:54.860
Now, honey, you got one minute
to get into makeup.

19:54.926 --> 19:59.060
Oh, Regine, I'm gonna do your
creases proud, girl.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.666
Hey, break a leg.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.300
I'm ready for my close‐up,
Mr. Pharr.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.133
Finally we are both happy
with this article.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.233
Yes, yes, you know

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
and I actually had fun
working on this.

20:14.366 --> 20:19.066
Hey, how about this? How about
an all‐legal issue of Flavor?

20:20.633 --> 20:22.866
Max, do you really think
the world is ready

20:22.933 --> 20:24.366
for that kind of boredom?

20:26.633 --> 20:27.600
‐ Hi.
‐ 'Hey, hey, hey.'

20:27.666 --> 20:28.666
Hey.

20:28.733 --> 20:30.066
How'd everything
go down at the soap?

20:30.133 --> 20:32.666
Wonderfully, once my
highly‐influential

20:32.733 --> 20:35.300
well‐connected friend, Regine,
here hooked me up.

20:35.366 --> 20:36.700
How much did that
sawed‐off seamstress

20:36.766 --> 20:38.966
pay you to put on this act?

20:39.033 --> 20:41.866
Excuse you, Ms. Missy,
but thanks to Regine

20:41.933 --> 20:44.100
Synclaire James finally
got her big break.

20:44.166 --> 20:46.133
I was an extra.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.866
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

20:48.933 --> 20:53.533
Really?
Wow, good lookin' out, Regine.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.600
‐ Actually, it wasn't all that‐‐
‐ Hard.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.766
It wasn't all that hard for
Regine to do that kind of thing.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.540
She practically runs the place.

21:01.873 --> 21:03.740
Ooh.

21:03.806 --> 21:05.073
You know, I would love to do

21:05.140 --> 21:06.840
a behind the scenes story
on you.

21:09.206 --> 21:10.973
<i>(Maxine)</i>
<i>Don't go away.</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:15.997 --> 21:17.530
[instrumental music]

21:21.363 --> 21:22.863
(Otto)
'Cut! Cut!'

21:24.530 --> 21:26.230
What is the Grim Reaper doing

21:26.297 --> 21:29.163
boogalooing and drinking
champagne?

21:29.230 --> 21:32.330
Well, now, wouldn't he celebrate
being the messenger of death?

21:32.397 --> 21:33.630
[laughs]
You know..

21:37.063 --> 21:38.630
[instrumental music]

21:43.030 --> 21:45.063
(Otto)
'Cut! Cut! Cut!'

21:45.130 --> 21:47.430
Oh, come on, now, I hooked him
just like you said.

21:47.497 --> 21:50.297
Well, I told you
to wait for your cue.

21:50.363 --> 21:52.430
Now, I believe
the messenger of death

will go for the element

[instrumental music]

22:06.437 --> 22:08.137
Woo woo woo!

22:08.970 --> 22:10.370
Woo woo woo!

22:10.437 --> 22:13.603
Cut! That was great!

22:13.670 --> 22:15.137
I don't know
what that woo woo woo was

22:15.203 --> 22:16.870
but boy,
it chilled me to the bone!

22:16.937 --> 22:18.737
‐ Woo woo woo!
‐ Woo woo woo!

22:18.803 --> 22:20.603
Come on, let's get a beer.
Come on, let's go.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.870
‐ That's a wrap.

<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
