IF YOU DON'T KISS ME,
I'LL REALIZE THIS

WHAT'S UP?

08:31.879 --> 08:33.981
OKAY.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.150
GRAM'S DEAD.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.019
WHO?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.154
[sobbing]
OKAY.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.291
SO YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS--
WAS VERY, VERY YOUNG?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.560
NO, SHE WAS SUPER OLD.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.863
BUT SHE NEVER FORGOT
MY BIRTHDAY...

08:49.863 --> 08:51.064
UNTIL THIS YEAR.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.834
AND I REALLY
LET HER HAVE IT.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.202
I'M GONNA PUT YOU IN A CAB
AND GET YOU HOME.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.070
NO, NO.
THEY SAY
THE BEST THING FOR GRIEVING

08:57.070 --> 08:58.706
IS TO BE BY YOURSELF.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.874
NO, NO, NO,
MINDY, MINDY, MINDY.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.043
NO, I CAN'T BE TRUSTED
TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.013
W--
IF I GO HOME TONIGHT ALONE,

09:06.013 --> 09:07.781
I WILL KILL
A HOMELESS PERSON.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.117
WHAT?
I'M NOT LITERALLY GONNA KILL

09:10.117 --> 09:12.085
A HOMELESS PERSON, OKAY?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.221
OKAY.
I'M GONNA KILL SOMETHING.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.356
CAN I STAY HERE TONIGHT,
PLEASE?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.191
YEAH. YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.961
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON

09:20.961 --> 09:23.931
THAT CAN GET ME
THROUGH THIS.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.036
PETER. JEREMY.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.272
BRANDON.
WEIRD BEARD.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.841
DUNCAN TELLS ME
YOU ARE MAKING A PLAY

09:33.841 --> 09:35.776
FOR THE NEW YORK
METROPOLITAN BALLET ACCOUNT.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.244
AND HOW DOES DUNCAN
KNOW THAT?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.679
MORGAN TWEETED IT.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.948
LET US SAVE YOU A SWIPE
OF YOUR METRO CARD,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.249
BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING
THAT ACCOUNT.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.350
[scoffs]

09:43.350 --> 09:45.753
BALLET CHOOSING MIDWIVES
OVER DOCTORS.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.655
WHILE IT'S TRUE WE LACK
YOUR NARROW-MINDED APPROACH

09:47.655 --> 09:49.389
TO MEDICINE, WE ARE BOTH
BALLET ENTHUSIASTS

09:49.389 --> 09:50.958
AND GOLD MEMBER DONORS.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.292
THAT'S $500.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.727
THAT'S MORE THAN THAT.
NO, IT'S NOT.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.328
OH, YES, IT IS.
HOW MUCH IS IT?

09:55.328 --> 09:56.730
I DON'T REMEMBER, DUNCAN,

09:56.730 --> 09:57.965
BUT IT WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.232
WELL, YOU WANT
TO REDO THE TAXES?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.033
YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONES

10:00.033 --> 10:01.234
THAT HAVE BEEN
AROUND THE BALLET?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.369
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.204
I WAS DRAGGED
TO EVERY SINGLE ONE

10:04.204 --> 10:05.706
OF MY SISTER'S
BALLET RECITALS.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.775
AND THEY WERE THE WORST.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.109
WAIT, YOU DON'T LIKE
THE BALLET?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.143
NO, I HATE IT.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.078
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE

10:11.078 --> 10:13.914
A LITTLE EXTRA SCRATCH
FOR THE PRACTICE.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.684
PLEASE DO NOT BE UPSET.
OKAY.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
BUT I DIDN'T BREAK UP
WITH CLIFF

10:18.652 --> 10:20.754
BECAUSE SOMEONE VERY CLOSE
TO HIM DIED,

10:20.754 --> 10:22.322
AND HE'S DEVASTATED.
WHO?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.291
HIS GRANDMOTHER.
NO.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.994
NO. NO, NO GROWN MAN
IS DEVASTATED

10:26.994 --> 10:28.696
WHEN HE LOSES
A GRANDPARENT.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.830
COME ON,
THAT IS AN EXCUSE.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.131
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK UP WITH HIM.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.266
I'M ALREADY BROKEN UP
WITH HIM IN MY HEART.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.501
I HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL AFTER THE FUNERAL.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.770
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S FORGET
THIS WHOLE PLANE THING HAPPENED.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.838
LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.106
LET'S CHALK IT UP
TO TURBULENCE

10:39.106 --> 10:40.708
AND ALTITUDE
AND THE BLUE CORN CHIPS.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.909
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.110
NO, NO, NO.
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.745
DON'T BE THAT WAY.
DON'T BE THAT WAY.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
WE'RE NOT GONNA PRETEND THAT
THE PLANE THING DIDN'T HAPPEN.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.447
WE'RE GONNA WAIT
A LITTLE BIT LONGER

10:47.447 --> 10:50.183
UNTIL HIS GRANDMOTHER
IS BURIED IN THE DIRT.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.119
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
YOU CAN GO TALK TO HIM

10:52.119 --> 10:53.120
AND SEE
HOW DEVASTATED HE IS.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.421
TALK TO HIM?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.724
(Jeremy)
NOW THE WOMAN
DOING FOUETTES

10:56.724 --> 10:58.225
IS THE PRIMA BALLERINA.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.360
THE REST OF THE DANCERS
MAKE UP THE CORPS DU BALLET.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.461
NOW THIS IS FANTAS--

11:01.461 --> 11:02.963
PETER!
I'M AWAKE.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.031
I'M NOT ASLEEP.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.800
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BALLET
AND YOU WERE A BEAR.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.401
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO AT LEAST FEIGN

11:08.401 --> 11:10.437
AN ENTHUSIASM FOR DANCE
IF WE'RE TO GET THE CONTRACT.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.471
NOW FOCUS.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.975
LOOK AT HER--
ELEGANT, ATHLETIC.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.045
HUH.
WHAT?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.714
I THINK I DATED HER...

11:20.714 --> 11:22.382
AND HER.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.417
AND HER.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.086
HOW MANY BALLERINAS
DID YOU DATE?

11:26.086 --> 11:28.388
WHEN I WAS GOING
THROUGH MY LOTHARIO PHASE,

11:28.388 --> 11:30.924
I WENT THROUGH SOMETHING
OF A BALLERINA TEAR.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.726
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
THROUGH THE DOOR.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.727
I GUESS I COULD GO GET IT.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.929
YOU THOUGHT A PIROUETTE
WAS A TYPE OF COOKIE.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.131
IT IS, AND IF YOU BREAK IT
IN HALF,

11:38.131 --> 11:40.333
IT'S ALSO
A BREAKFAST CEREAL.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.936
[knock at door]

11:42.936 --> 11:45.205
HEY, CLIFF.
HEY, DANNY.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.807
MINDY SAID YOU WERE SAD
ABOUT YOUR GRANDMA.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.376
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT THAT, SO I...

11:49.376 --> 11:50.944
BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.414
"DR. DAN'S FUNKY ALE."

11:54.414 --> 11:56.516
I BREW IT MYSELF
IN MY GUEST BATHROOM.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.418
OH.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.456
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S GOOD.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.125
MINDY SAYS
YOU'RE REALLY UPSET?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.494
NO, I'M NOT UPSET, DANNY.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.229
YEAH, IT'S YOUR GRANDMA.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.397
I'M ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.232
NO PERSON SHOULD EVER HAVE

12:12.232 --> 12:14.301
TO BURY A GRANDPARENT.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.770
THANK GOD
FOR MINDY, THOUGH.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.505
SHE REALLY TOOK CARE
OF ME LAST NIGHT.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.774
[sighs]
YEAH, SHE'S A GOOD KID.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.444
SHE TOOK CARE OF YOU?
S-SHE MADE YOU SOUP?

12:24.444 --> 12:26.814
NO, SHE CAME OVER
AND SPENT THE NIGHT.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.016
LIKE, SHE SLEPT ON THE COUCH
WHILE YOU SLEPT

12:29.016 --> 12:30.283
IN THE OTHER ROOM
ON THE BED?

12:30.283 --> 12:33.120
YEAH. NO.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.088
NO, WE SLEPT
IN THE SAME BED.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.391
SO WERE YOU,
LIKE, AROUSED?

12:38.391 --> 12:41.494
I'M GONNA CUT THIS CONVERSATION
SHORT, DANNY.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.296
IT'S GETTING
PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.464
YEAH.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.034
SO, MINDY...

12:47.034 --> 12:48.201
HEY.
HEY.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.571
DID YOU--DID YOU CHEAT
ON ME WITH CLIFF?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.507
WHAT?
NO.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.543
IF ANYTHING, I CHEATED
ON CLIFF WITH YOU.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.012
HE STRONGLY IMPLIED
THAT YOU TWO MATED.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.547
WHAT?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
OKAY, YOU TWO,
GET OUT OF HERE.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.917
GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL,
ALL RIGHT?

13:03.917 --> 13:07.120
SCRAM.
SIT DOWN.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.023
SEE THIS?
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME ON THIS

13:10.023 --> 13:12.559
WHAT YOU DID
TO CLIFF LAST NIGHT.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.094
WHAT?
SHOW ME.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.562
OKAY, THIS IS DUMB.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.930
SURE, FINE, DANNY.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.200
HIS ARM WAS--

13:20.200 --> 13:22.936
I DON'T KNOW--
LIKE, HERE.

13:22.936 --> 13:26.539
AND HIS HAND
WAS, I GUESS, A BIT CUPPED.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.041
YOUR BREAST?
YES.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.109
AND WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.477
MY HAND WAS HERE.
HIS KNEE?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.412
IN THAT REGION.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.014
THAT'S THE, UH--
THAT'S THE GROIN?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.582
I DID NOT SLEEP
WITH CLIFF.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.217
I SLEPT NEXT TO CLIFF

13:37.217 --> 13:39.286
BECAUSE HE WAS
VERY, VERY SAD.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.521
NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENED.
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.590
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENED"?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.158
I MASSAGED HIS JEANS.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.426
WAS HE IN THE JEANS?

13:46.426 --> 13:49.863
DANNY, CLIFF
MIGHT HAVE MY HAND,

13:49.863 --> 13:51.865
BUT YOU...

13:51.865 --> 13:53.433
YOU HAVE MY HEART.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.435
AND YOU HAVE TO WRITE
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S EULOGY FOR ME,

13:55.435 --> 13:56.904
BECAUSE HE THINKS
I'M A GREAT WRITER

13:56.904 --> 13:58.939
BECAUSE OF YOUR LETTER.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.640
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WRITE
THE EULOGY BY YOURSELF, OKAY?

14:00.640 --> 14:03.510
UNLESS YOU SPRAINED
YOUR HAND LAST NIGHT.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.881
[knock at door]

14:07.881 --> 14:09.082
KNOCK-MASTE.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.984
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
FOR YOU.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.295
NO BALLERINA IS GONNA WANT
TO JUMP INTO THE STIRRUPS

14:22.295 --> 14:24.397
FOR A PARTY-HUNGRY BRO-DOG
LIKE ME.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.433
WELL, YOU'RE LESS DUMB
THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.568
HOWEVER, THERE IS NO WAY
THAT A BALLERINA

14:28.568 --> 14:30.337
WANTS TO HAVE
THEIR PELVIS EXAMINED

14:30.337 --> 14:33.473
BY AN UNLICENSED HIPPIE
WITCH DOCTOR LIKE YOU.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.076
WELL, WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSITION?
I AM VERY BUSY.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.677
I HAVE TO PLAN DUNCAN'S
60TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

14:37.677 --> 14:41.949
WHAT I'M PROPOSING
IS THAT WE TEAM UP TOGETHER.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.451
IT'S OUTSIDE THE BOX.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.687
BUT OUTSIDE THE BOX
IS WHERE I CHOOSE TO LIVE.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.889
OH, MY GOD,
I'M GONNA BARF.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.928
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.363
YOU'RE BARELY FRIENDS
WITH CLIFF.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.231
ASK ME ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
GO AHEAD.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.933
EYES--
DEEP SKY BLUE.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.701
FAVORITE BEER--
DR. DAN'S FUNKY ALE.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.136
YOU MADE HIM
DRINK YOUR BEER?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.304
YES, I DID.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.538
HE LOVED IT.
HEY, GUYS.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.340
HEY.
BOY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.708
I CAN'T WAIT
TO READ YOUR EULOGY.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.510
YOU'RE JUST--YOU'RE SO GREAT
WITH WORDS.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.080
AND I KNOW THAT GRAM REALLY
WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED IT,

15:13.080 --> 15:16.716
PROVIDED SHE NEVER
ACTUALLY SAW YOU.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.451
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS...

15:18.451 --> 15:21.421
RACIST.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.722
YEAH, ME TOO.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.058
I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR THIS EULOGY.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.627
WE GOT QUITE A WORDSMITH
OVER HERE.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.529
OKAY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE EXCITED FOR A EULOGY.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.697
THAT'S VERY MORBID.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.731
I AM TOO.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.300
POOR, SWEET CLIFF.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.734
WE ARE GONNA FIND
WHO DID THIS TO HER,

15:34.734 --> 15:36.203
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

15:36.203 --> 15:37.337
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

15:37.337 --> 15:38.705
WE'RE GONNA FORGIVE 'EM.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.607
[voice breaking]
I KISSED MY GRANDMOTHER SO TIGHT

15:40.607 --> 15:41.574
ON THE LIPS THIS MORNING,

15:41.574 --> 15:45.578
SHE SAID--SHE SAID,
"GET THE HELL OFF ME."

15:45.578 --> 15:47.014
WE GOT IN A BIG FIGHT.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.050
AND SHE'S IN HEAVEN
RIGHT NOW

15:50.050 --> 15:51.184
WITH HER LITTLE BOWS
AND ARROWS,

15:51.184 --> 15:53.053
SHOOTING PEOPLE
IN THE BUTT.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.354
[sobs]

15:54.354 --> 15:55.655
DID YOU KNOW HER?

15:55.655 --> 15:57.524
NO.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.760
AND TOGETHER, WE CAN SERVE
NOT JUST YOUR BODIES,

16:00.760 --> 16:03.330
BUT YOUR MINDS,
YOUR SOULS,

16:03.330 --> 16:04.664
YOUR CHAKRAS,

16:04.664 --> 16:06.133
AND, OF COURSE,
YOUR VAGINAS.

16:06.133 --> 16:10.103
THE "PAS DE DEUX"
OF OUR TWO PRACTICES

16:10.103 --> 16:14.174
WILL LEAVE YOUR COMPANY'S HEALTH
IN FIRST POSITION.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.642
I DIDN'T EXPECT
SUCH A LOVE OF BALLET

16:15.642 --> 16:18.011
FROM A MAN WHO BURPED
SO MUCH IN THE WAITING ROOM.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.446
WELL, BALLET EXCITES ME.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.315
AND WHEN I GET EXCITED,
I BELCH.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.683
WHILE WE'RE MAKING
OUR DECISION,

16:23.683 --> 16:26.153
YOU SHOULD STAY
FOR REHEARSAL.
OH, I DON'T THINK--

16:26.153 --> 16:28.188
(Brendan)
EXCELLENT. WHAT A TREAT.
WE'D LOVE TO.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.722
WE'LL BE DOING
THE WHOLE RUN-THROUGH.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.025
IT'LL BE FOUR HOURS
OF OUR MOST SUBTLE WORK.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.160
AH.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.195
WHAT A PERFECT AMOUNT OF TIME

16:35.195 --> 16:38.498
FOR A WORDLESS
CLASSICAL DANCE PERFORMANCE.

16:39.599 --> 16:43.336
WELL, PETER,
THIS IS HOW YOU DIE.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.704
I'D LIKE TO SAY
A FEW WORDS,

16:44.704 --> 16:48.641
IF I MAY, TO HONOR THE WOMAN
WE ALL KNOW AS GRAM,

16:48.641 --> 16:51.778
WHICH IS SHORT FOR "GRANDMA"...

16:51.778 --> 16:55.382
WHICH IN ITSELF
IS SHORT FOR "GRANDMOTHER."

16:55.382 --> 16:57.750
"BUT HER REAL NAME
WASN'T GRAM,

16:57.750 --> 17:01.821
"IT WAS 'FIND OUT REAL NAME
FROM CLIFF.'

17:01.821 --> 17:05.592
OKAY, I FORGOT TO TEXT HIM.
[clears throat]

17:05.592 --> 17:08.195
"WHEN AN OLD PERSON DIES,
IT ISN'T AS TRAGIC

17:08.195 --> 17:10.097
"AS SOMEONE TAKEN FROM US
TOO SOON,

17:10.097 --> 17:14.601
"LIKE ANNA NICOLE SMITH,

17:14.601 --> 17:16.403
BUT IRREGARDLESS"--
MM...

17:16.403 --> 17:20.407
WHAT?
"WE FEEL 'SADLINESS.'"

17:20.407 --> 17:21.841
IS THAT A WORD?

17:21.841 --> 17:23.843
"TO QUOTE KENDRICK LAMAR
IN HIS SONG,

17:23.843 --> 17:25.712
EXPLETIVE,
DON'T KILL MY VIBE"--

17:25.712 --> 17:28.081
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S--WHY DON'T WE--

17:28.081 --> 17:30.750
LET'S JUST, YOU KNOW, JUMP AHEAD
A LITTLE BIT HERE.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.684
NO, NO,
CLIFF, CLIFF...

17:31.684 --> 17:33.220
"WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.621
"I'M SURE GRAM HAD NO IDEA

17:34.621 --> 17:35.855
HER HEAD WOULD EXPLODE."

17:35.855 --> 17:37.457
OH, GOD.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.092
(Cliff)
"THERE'S ALWAYS ONE REASON

17:39.092 --> 17:40.793
"MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY OTHER

17:40.793 --> 17:43.763
"THAT YOU SHOULD JUST BE
WITH THAT PERSON OR PERSONS--

17:43.763 --> 17:46.833
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE
WITHOUT THEM."

17:49.102 --> 17:50.503
"AT ANY MOMENT,
THERE'S PLENTY OF REASONS

17:50.503 --> 17:52.839
"NOT TO SPEND TIME
WITH SOMEONE--

17:52.839 --> 17:54.607
YOU'RE BUSY,
YOU'RE FIGHTING,

17:54.607 --> 17:56.776
"YOU'RE SURFING THE INTERNET,
HOLD FOR LAUGHS"--

17:56.776 --> 17:58.811
NOPE.
[laughs]

17:58.811 --> 18:01.181
THE INTERNET CAN SUCK UP
A LOT OF YOUR TIME.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.616
COME HERE.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.320
DANNY.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.856
WAIT, DANNY. DANNY, I HAVEN'T
BROKEN UP WITH CLIFF YET.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.558
WHAT ABOUT BLOODY MARY?

18:11.558 --> 18:12.859
THE VIRGIN MARY.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.462
GOD,

18:15.462 --> 18:19.199
GIVE US A SIGN IF YOU THINK
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.352
[siren wailing]
[exhales]

18:39.352 --> 18:43.290
WELL, THE CHURCH
WASN'T DAMAGED,

18:43.290 --> 18:44.857
BUT I GUESS
THE SERVICE IS OVER.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.359
YEAH.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.461
I GUESS WE'RE GOING
WITH CREMATION AFTER ALL.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.731
OH, GOD.
HEY, CLIFF, I AM SO, SO SORRY.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.333
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.635
I KNOCKED OVER A CANDLE
WITH MY BUTTOCKS.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.837
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN--
HOW COULD I BE UPSET WITH YOU

18:57.837 --> 18:59.506
WHEN YOU WERE PROBABLY
JUST TRYING TO LIGHT

18:59.506 --> 19:00.873
A VIGIL CANDLE
FOR GRAM?

19:00.873 --> 19:03.210
SO SWEET.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.212
OH, GOD.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646
I'M GONNA GET US
SOME SODA POP.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.848
YOU A ROOT BEER MAN?
NO.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.718
I'LL GET AN ASSORTMENT.
OKAY.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.588
CLIFF...

19:15.588 --> 19:19.226
I KISSED DANNY.

19:19.226 --> 19:23.430
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S A ONE-TIME THING.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.633
I THINK I HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM,

19:26.633 --> 19:30.203
AND I WANT
TO PURSUE THEM.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.504
I AM SO SORRY.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.306
OKAY, SO...

19:33.306 --> 19:34.707
[exhales sharply]
WHEN THE CANDLE FELL OVER--

19:34.707 --> 19:35.975
(Danny)
MORE BAD NEWS, CLIFF.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.745
I'M SORRY.
THEY'RE OUT OF ROOT BEER.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.313
OH, MY GOD!

19:40.313 --> 19:42.249
MY ONLY SOLACE IS IN KNOWING

19:42.249 --> 19:44.284
THAT GRAM WAS A CRUEL
AND UNFORGIVING WOMAN,

19:44.284 --> 19:48.521
AND HER GHOST
WILL HAUNT YOU FOR ETERNITY.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.859
[classical music playing]

19:52.859 --> 19:54.327
*

19:54.327 --> 19:55.995
I'VE SEEN THIS BALLET
PERFORMED MANY TIMES,

19:55.995 --> 19:57.564
BUT NEVER QUITE SO SLOWLY.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.999
IT'S ALMOST MORE POWERFUL.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.634
PETER, ARE YOU CRYING?

20:01.634 --> 20:05.505
I'M CRYING BECAUSE I NEED
TO PINCH A NIP TO STAY AWAKE.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.907
LOOK, SHE WILL CROSS THE STAGE
TO JOIN HER LOVE.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.742
WHEN SHE GETS THERE,
THERE WILL BE AN INTERMISSION,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.744
SO HANG ON.
TERRIFIC.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.481
HERE SHE GOES.
OH, MY GOD, GET TO HIM.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.449
SHE'S GOING,
BUT, OH, NO, SHE GOES BACK.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.450
OH, GOD.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.985
THERE SHE GOES.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.391
GO TO HIM!
[coughs]

20:24.391 --> 20:26.526
PETER.
MOVE FASTER!

20:26.526 --> 20:27.827
DON'T ST--

20:27.827 --> 20:29.296
GO TO HIM!
GET THERE FA--

20:29.296 --> 20:30.597
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
HELPING HER?

20:30.597 --> 20:32.532
SHE CLEARLY HAS SOME SORT
OF DISABILITY.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.967
JUST WALK TO HIM.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.470
THERE!
WE ALL DID IT TOGETHER!

20:37.470 --> 20:40.673
INTERMISSION!
BRAVA!

20:46.279 --> 20:48.515
WE CAN FIND OUR OWN WAY OUT.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.751
(Mindy)
I DON'T HAVE AN ICE PACK
FOR YOUR LIP.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.420
JUST USE ONE
OF THOSE FROZEN PIZZA BAGELS.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.355
THESE THINGS HAVE
A LOT OF NITRATES IN THEM.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.489
YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THEM.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.325
OKAY, THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE
SOMETHING TO PUT ON YOUR LIP.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.393
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GOOD.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.796
I'M GOOD.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.599
SO, UH...

21:06.599 --> 21:07.534
NOW WHAT?

21:07.534 --> 21:11.304
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR BRUISED LIPS.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.472
NO, NO, THEY'RE NUMB.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.608
THERE'S A KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY
ON THE HISTORY OF DOO-WOP.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.844
I SAW THAT ONE.

21:25.685 --> 21:29.622
[lightbulb pops]
[gasps]

21:29.622 --> 21:31.491
(both)
GRAM?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.626
(man)
GO TO BED.
