WEBVTT

00:06.424 --> 00:08.899
I'm on a roll!

00:08.901 --> 00:12.236
This book is gonna be sick.

00:12.238 --> 00:15.406
Stephen King, watch your back.

00:15.433 --> 00:19.093
I cannot believe that you
really wrote a book, Hank.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.896
I've never even seen you read a book.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.048
See, this book is like my baby,

00:25.073 --> 00:27.416
'cause it's been gestating
in my brain uterus

00:27.441 --> 00:28.496
for, like, ten years.

00:28.521 --> 00:30.006
So, now I'm ready

00:30.031 --> 00:33.032
to squeeze it out and
present it to the world.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.092
I call it...

00:35.119 --> 00:36.938
<i>- Shade by Hank Henderson.
- Oh.</i>

00:36.963 --> 00:40.765
<i>Ooh. Shade.</i>

00:40.792 --> 00:43.292
I once tried to write a book.

00:47.632 --> 00:50.107
That's the end of the story. I, uh...

00:50.109 --> 00:52.386
I once tried to write
a book, and I stopped.

00:52.411 --> 00:54.470
It's really hard.

00:56.616 --> 00:59.273
That was the best blind
date I've ever been on,

00:59.298 --> 01:01.043
and I've been on three of 'em.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.712
I'm, uh... I'm gonna head out.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.123
Uh, hey. Uh...

01:06.125 --> 01:08.769
what do you think about
grabbing a drink later?

01:08.794 --> 01:10.818
I mean, not that I
would drink myself, no.

01:10.843 --> 01:13.722
If I have a little bit
of alcohol, oh, look out.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.596
- I have the worst gas.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:17.621 --> 01:20.752
You mentioned that... how your
large intestine is too small,

01:20.777 --> 01:23.047
- and your small intestine... 
- Small intestine too large.

01:23.071 --> 01:24.114
Oh, look at us.

01:24.138 --> 01:26.597
We're already finishing each other's...

01:27.463 --> 01:28.870
So, I'm gonna go.

01:28.895 --> 01:31.229
I'll, uh... I'll see you later, Leonard.

01:31.254 --> 01:33.196
- I'll hold you to that.
- Ah.

01:33.221 --> 01:35.146
Oh, heck, I just want to hold you.

01:35.171 --> 01:36.729
Oh!

01:39.328 --> 01:41.662
What the hell, Charlie?!

01:41.664 --> 01:43.629
Why'd you set me up with that guy?

01:43.654 --> 01:46.571
All he did was talk about gas.

01:47.005 --> 01:50.719
Well, gas pricing is a
fascinating mix of geo...

01:50.744 --> 01:52.616
<i>His gas, Charlie.</i>

01:52.641 --> 01:54.116
Butt gas.

01:55.859 --> 01:57.670
On a date! It's not exactly

01:57.695 --> 02:00.491
- the kind of guy I usually go for.
- Oh, no. You're right.

02:00.516 --> 02:02.958
<i>He's a lot better than the
guys you usually go for.</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:04.856
What?

02:04.881 --> 02:07.340
You go for losers, Margaret.

02:07.365 --> 02:09.139
<i>Huge losers.</i>

02:09.164 --> 02:11.378
She does.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.967
That food snob Murray was a sociopath,

02:13.992 --> 02:16.232
that colonel picked you
up at his wife's funeral,

02:16.257 --> 02:18.415
- and that Karl was the Zodiac Killer.
- Yeah.

02:18.435 --> 02:20.083
So that's, uh,

02:20.103 --> 02:22.328
loser, loser...

02:22.355 --> 02:24.254
murderer/loser.

02:24.279 --> 02:27.034
Okay, but those guys were...

02:27.059 --> 02:28.851
I mean, there was also...

02:28.969 --> 02:30.260
Ugh.

02:30.321 --> 02:31.946
Well, it's not like...

02:32.023 --> 02:34.866
Oh, my God, I only date losers.

02:36.435 --> 02:38.786
Does this mean that I've become a loser?

02:43.117 --> 02:46.919
That doesn't feel like a
safe question to answer.

02:59.592 --> 03:01.458
How did this happen?

03:01.519 --> 03:05.221
You know, before I moved
in here, I crushed ass.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.556
<i>Quality ass.</i>

03:07.650 --> 03:09.375
I dated a Bee Gee.

03:09.818 --> 03:11.668
Well, it's simple.

03:11.693 --> 03:13.623
You're not putting
enough effort into it.

03:13.648 --> 03:15.615
You're waiting for guys to approach you.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.880
That's like sitting on the beach

03:16.904 --> 03:19.005
waiting for the fish to wash ashore.

03:20.154 --> 03:23.313
More like pieces of ocean trash.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.770
Yeah, if you want to
catch the good fish,

03:25.795 --> 03:27.484
i.e. hot dudes,

03:27.504 --> 03:30.922
you got to go swimming
in the ocean, i.e. try.

03:33.028 --> 03:35.807
Well, I guess maybe I could
up my game a little bit.

03:35.832 --> 03:37.382
I could still date a hot guy.

03:37.407 --> 03:40.167
- Gene in the house!
- Gene!

03:41.844 --> 03:43.302
I'm gonna date him.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.124
Gene?!

03:46.149 --> 03:47.710
Margaret,

03:47.735 --> 03:49.415
we said go fishing in the ocean.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.350
We didn't say go harpoon a
white whale with your bare hands.

03:54.051 --> 03:55.823
I could date Gene. I just, uh...

03:55.848 --> 03:57.775
I just need to pull out all the stops.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.124
Watch out, boys.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.666
I'm jumping in the ocean.

04:04.837 --> 04:07.307
So, Hank, tell me all about your book.

04:07.332 --> 04:08.897
And speak real slow, 'cause

04:08.924 --> 04:12.750
the last book I finished was
written by Reese Witherspoon.

04:12.775 --> 04:14.988
First of all, we all know

04:15.013 --> 04:18.089
vampires are sexy as hell, right?

04:18.225 --> 04:19.999
Yeah.

04:20.017 --> 04:22.686
And who is the sexiest
vampire of all time?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.522
<i>Brad Pitt, Interview with the Vampire.</i>

04:25.682 --> 04:27.173
Wrong.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.175
<i>Tom Cruise, Interview with the Vampire.</i>

04:29.194 --> 04:30.676
No.

04:30.696 --> 04:33.177
<i>Antonio Banderas, Interview with the... </i>

04:33.202 --> 04:35.440
<i>Stop guessing Interview
with the Vampire!</i>

04:35.558 --> 04:37.275
Now, the sexiest vampire

04:37.300 --> 04:40.352
<i>of all time is obviously
Wesley Snipes in Blade.</i>

04:40.563 --> 04:43.874
And what is the one complaint
everybody has about that movie?

04:43.992 --> 04:46.117
Never saw it.

04:46.235 --> 04:47.952
Not enough sex.

04:48.029 --> 04:51.044
You can't walk down the
street without somebody saying,

04:51.069 --> 04:52.679
<i>"You know the problem
with that movie Blade is?</i>

04:52.703 --> 04:54.144
Ain't got enough sex scenes."

04:54.169 --> 04:55.886
Well...

04:56.046 --> 04:57.629
problem solved.

04:57.723 --> 04:59.556
I present to you...

04:59.581 --> 05:01.082
<i>Shade.</i>

05:01.107 --> 05:02.442
Oh.

05:02.467 --> 05:04.610
Now, be careful. That's my baby, now.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.176
Don't forget to support his head.

05:06.201 --> 05:09.067
All right, let's get started.

05:09.092 --> 05:12.068
Read it out loud so I know
which parts get to you the most.

05:15.828 --> 05:19.346
"Shade strutted into the sexy-ass club

05:19.769 --> 05:22.487
and was all like,

05:22.605 --> 05:26.324
'What's up, y'all? Who
wants to get freaky?'"

05:26.349 --> 05:28.257
Ah!

05:28.282 --> 05:30.190
- That's just the first sentence!
- Let's see.

05:30.215 --> 05:32.324
We're gonna need more water up in here!

05:37.162 --> 05:40.379
"Shade pulled a photo of his father,

05:40.404 --> 05:42.100
who was dead,

05:42.125 --> 05:44.826
out of his pocket, and whispered,

05:44.828 --> 05:46.853
'Fangs for nothing.'"

05:48.965 --> 05:51.942
Wow! Hank, I love it.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.662
It's the best thing I ever created,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.895
and that's including my kids.

05:57.098 --> 05:58.931
Now, did you notice that

05:58.951 --> 06:02.010
Shade's minivan was really
a metaphor for society?

06:02.012 --> 06:03.436
Oh, big time.

06:03.455 --> 06:05.180
Especially when I saw this post-it

06:05.182 --> 06:07.958
says "Van equals society."

06:09.986 --> 06:13.296
Well, now all I got to
do is get it published.

06:13.321 --> 06:15.801
You know, I've been calling
every Stephen King in the book,

06:15.826 --> 06:17.762
but I ain't got the right one yet.

06:17.877 --> 06:22.639
I know someone in the
Tucson publishing world.

06:23.418 --> 06:26.194
My second cousin is in the biz.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.563
Ooh.

06:31.063 --> 06:33.213
I'm gonna need a minute.

06:33.238 --> 06:35.313
What's wrong, Hank?

06:35.338 --> 06:37.255
Oh, geez.

06:38.657 --> 06:42.117
I can't believe how rich I'm gonna be!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.502
All right.

06:50.527 --> 06:53.563
Wow, you are crazy tall today.

06:53.588 --> 06:55.691
Most old ladies shrink,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.269
but you're just getting
bigger and bigger.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.199
Yeah. These are my, uh...

06:59.224 --> 07:01.069
- my A-game heels.
- Oh.

07:01.071 --> 07:03.087
My tall boys.

07:03.112 --> 07:05.158
Had to retire these in the '90s

07:05.183 --> 07:07.392
'cause my calves were
getting too muscular.

07:09.246 --> 07:11.521
Ah, hey, I still got it.

07:15.527 --> 07:17.343
What are you doing?

07:17.362 --> 07:18.972
Well, this is my go-to move.

07:18.997 --> 07:21.149
I make eye contact with
a guy, and I hold it,

07:21.205 --> 07:23.510
and just when it starts to get weird,

07:23.535 --> 07:25.518
I break into a million-dollar smile.

07:25.537 --> 07:27.871
It works every time.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.749
- Look, watch this.
- Okay.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.133
Whoa.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.951
Ah...

08:08.305 --> 08:10.321
Evening, Gene.

08:10.415 --> 08:12.382
<i>Don't forget to call your pocket... </i>

08:17.814 --> 08:20.665
Margaret, are you okay?

08:20.741 --> 08:23.409
Okay. Just, uh, living the dream.

08:25.013 --> 08:26.579
Okay. Cool.

08:29.601 --> 08:31.492
Okay.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.364
Okay, just... get yourself up

08:34.389 --> 08:36.087
and out of here

08:36.107 --> 08:38.107
with your dignity intact.

08:49.121 --> 08:50.678
Ah.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.530
Eh...

08:52.555 --> 08:54.513
Ooh, okay.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.207
Please don't be watching me.

09:09.641 --> 09:11.304
Okay, that's settled.

09:11.329 --> 09:13.504
I'm officially a loser.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.316
Ahooga!

09:22.393 --> 09:24.468
Wow. Look at you.

09:24.656 --> 09:27.882
Don't mind me. I'm just rolling
my tongue back in my mouth.

09:29.886 --> 09:31.477
Thanks.

09:31.496 --> 09:35.056
Hey, would you make me
the happiest man on Earth

09:35.058 --> 09:36.557
and let me buy you a drink?

09:36.585 --> 09:38.334
Oh, Leonard...

09:38.369 --> 09:40.319
- you can buy me ten.
- Oh.

09:49.848 --> 09:51.848
Ugh.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.077
Oh!

09:56.079 --> 09:57.687
Ah.

10:01.717 --> 10:03.359
Good morning, beautiful.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.375
Sorry.

10:19.494 --> 10:23.755
My small intestine is up to no good.

10:25.608 --> 10:29.368
Boy, you must have shimmied
something askew last night.

10:31.547 --> 10:36.226
- Leonard, last night was a mis... 
- Was amazing. I know.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.394
You were insatiable, my lady.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.715
No, it was a mistake.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.551
I was feeling very vulnerable and shaky,

10:45.628 --> 10:49.054
both physically and
emotionally, and I...

10:49.074 --> 10:51.824
Do you think we can get
another candle going in here?

10:54.079 --> 10:55.578
Leonard?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.582
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

10:57.606 --> 10:59.231
I was thinking about last night.

10:59.251 --> 11:01.178
I still can't believe it happened.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.569
Me, either, but it did,

11:03.588 --> 11:05.663
so I'm gonna have to live with that.

11:05.781 --> 11:07.406
Well, sister, let me tell you.

11:07.425 --> 11:10.334
You're gonna be living with
this guy for a long time.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.223
Ooh, ooh. B-R-B.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.918
I got to get out of here.

11:21.616 --> 11:23.507
Oh!

11:23.858 --> 11:28.236
You two bitches are going
straight to Goodwill.

11:31.703 --> 11:35.538
Well, uh, you read my book,

11:35.932 --> 11:39.183
so I stand here before you exposed,

11:39.208 --> 11:42.018
much like Shade when
he traded in his fangs

11:42.043 --> 11:45.353
for the love of his
life, Serena Williams.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.355
Well, listen, here's the deal.

11:47.382 --> 11:49.299
This book is super weird,

11:49.417 --> 11:53.303
and it was hard to follow with
all the post-its falling out.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.696
And, uh, men's erotic fiction

11:55.724 --> 11:58.549
is a genre that doesn't really exist.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.202
But... ?

12:01.204 --> 12:04.266
But I have to admit... I loved it.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.285
- Oh!
- Hot damn! It turned you on, didn't it?

12:06.309 --> 12:09.560
I mean, yeah.

12:09.585 --> 12:11.901
This is for all the fellas

12:11.926 --> 12:15.321
who just want to sit by
the fire with a good book

12:15.346 --> 12:19.181
and work up a chubby.

12:19.355 --> 12:21.556
Oh, I did just have one tiny note.

12:21.558 --> 12:22.999
Instead of a minivan,

12:23.117 --> 12:25.501
I think Shade should drive a motorcycle.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.655
Oh, no.

12:29.674 --> 12:32.592
So... you want to get rid of the minivan?

12:34.036 --> 12:36.179
Okay, then. All right. Okay.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.756
I just have, uh, one question.

12:38.781 --> 12:42.927
Did you not notice that the
minivan represents society?!

12:43.021 --> 12:44.406
Uh...

12:44.430 --> 12:46.764
I did not notice that at all.

12:46.789 --> 12:48.847
Did that post-it fall out?

12:48.872 --> 12:51.174
What kind of publisher are you, man?

12:51.199 --> 12:54.365
This is my masterpiece, and
you don't give a master notes.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.757
You don't go to-to Michelangelo

12:56.759 --> 12:58.772
and say, "Oh, excuse me. I got one note.

12:58.797 --> 13:00.371
Don't be a Ninja Turtle."

13:00.396 --> 13:01.704
Come on, Sid.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.495
We're up out of here.

13:04.374 --> 13:05.890
Charlie,

13:05.915 --> 13:08.688
you're not gonna believe
what I did last night.

13:08.713 --> 13:10.546
You slept with Leonard.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.125
What? How did you know?

13:14.150 --> 13:16.567
He texted me right after it happened.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.674
He said you kept the boots on.

13:22.918 --> 13:25.136
There she is.

13:25.212 --> 13:27.855
Miss High Heels, USA.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.628
Great, so you did see it.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.499
Oh, of course I saw it. I've
been telling everybody about it.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.743
That part where you pretended
that you couldn't walk,

13:39.768 --> 13:42.078
it was hilarious.

13:42.103 --> 13:43.237
It was?

13:43.262 --> 13:45.956
- Oh, yes.
- Well, yeah, of course it was.

13:45.981 --> 13:48.808
I mean, my, uh, my
comedy's kind of cerebral,

13:48.833 --> 13:51.465
but I'm-I'm glad you got the joke.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.668
I don't think he did.

13:52.693 --> 13:55.112
It wasn't a joke.

13:55.137 --> 13:57.291
Shut up, Charlie.

13:57.316 --> 14:00.204
So I was just wondering
if maybe you'd like

14:00.229 --> 14:02.073
to have a drink with me tonight.

14:02.098 --> 14:04.499
Uh-uh. Sorry, pal, she's taken.

14:04.524 --> 14:06.339
She literally just banged...

14:06.364 --> 14:07.764
Shut up, Charlie!

14:15.734 --> 14:18.234
I got a date with Gene.

14:18.259 --> 14:20.235
I am back, baby.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.310
I'm back, baby.

14:23.641 --> 14:25.549
I just did our grocery shopping.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.445
I couldn't figure out what
peanut butter to get,

14:27.469 --> 14:29.560
so I bought every one.

14:29.585 --> 14:31.748
I got crunchy, I got smooth,

14:31.773 --> 14:34.066
and I even got the one
with the peanut butter

14:34.091 --> 14:36.187
and the jelly all swirled together,

14:36.219 --> 14:38.912
much like our limbs were last night.

14:40.386 --> 14:42.620
Charlie, thanks again for
setting me up with Margaret.

14:42.645 --> 14:44.970
It's the best deal I ever made.

14:52.129 --> 14:53.904
Deal?

14:53.929 --> 14:55.846
What deal is he talking about?

14:56.075 --> 14:58.242
I just, uh...

14:58.267 --> 14:59.567
You know, uh...

15:01.748 --> 15:04.373
I can't come up with
a lie, so here goes.

15:06.978 --> 15:08.310
I owed him 50 bucks,

15:08.312 --> 15:10.329
and he said he would let it slide

15:10.354 --> 15:12.889
if I set the two of you up on a date.

15:12.914 --> 15:15.505
You sold me?

15:15.530 --> 15:16.724
Well, yeah.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.240
You know how sometimes
friends sell friends?

15:19.265 --> 15:21.842
Unbelievable.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.256
You set me up with that clinger,

15:23.281 --> 15:24.908
so you better just make him go away.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.151
And I don't care what
you say, you just do it.

15:27.278 --> 15:29.853
I cannot believe you sold me.

15:29.878 --> 15:32.528
For 50 bucks?

15:32.803 --> 15:35.045
Well, at least I-I
sold you for something.

15:35.070 --> 15:37.296
You've been just
giving it away for free.

15:42.346 --> 15:44.039
<i>I have compromised</i>

15:44.064 --> 15:47.199
my whole life; I'm not
gonna compromise on this.

15:47.224 --> 15:50.277
Looks like my baby is
just gonna have to wind up

15:50.302 --> 15:52.958
- in the drawer forever.
- Oh, oh, oh.

15:52.983 --> 15:56.226
Hank. You seem sadder than Shade

15:56.251 --> 16:00.125
when he found out he'd never
see Serena Williams play tennis,

16:00.150 --> 16:03.577
because tennis happens in the sunlight.

16:05.153 --> 16:08.379
I'm exactly that sad, Sid.

16:08.539 --> 16:10.630
Oh. Well, screw it.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.392
We don't need a publisher.

16:13.417 --> 16:16.210
We will take it straight to the people.

16:16.235 --> 16:19.385
<i>You said Shade needs to
be experienced, right?</i>

16:19.410 --> 16:21.668
Well, let's give the
people an experience

16:21.693 --> 16:24.694
they will never forget.

16:30.169 --> 16:34.338
And that's when I started
saying "Gene in the house."

16:34.363 --> 16:37.522
And I mean, it just took off.

16:37.547 --> 16:41.106
Oh, I wish I had an
entrance line like that.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.649
Sometimes I say
"Margaret in the Target,"

16:43.674 --> 16:47.752
but that only works when I'm at Target.

16:48.055 --> 16:50.238
- You are kickass.
- Oh.

16:50.263 --> 16:52.055
I'm-I'm gonna get us another drink.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.120
"Margaret in the Target."

16:56.782 --> 16:58.133
There you are.

17:00.504 --> 17:02.705
I've been looking everywhere for you.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.432
Leonard, what are you doing here?

17:04.457 --> 17:06.683
Charlie told me why we can't date.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.332
Well, whatever he said is true. So, bye.

17:09.357 --> 17:11.431
No. I am not going anywhere.

17:11.455 --> 17:13.630
And I'm telling you, I am
still going to make love to you,

17:13.654 --> 17:16.946
even though, as we speak, you
are being consumed by an STD.

17:27.426 --> 17:30.413
Look, this is all a huge mistake.

17:30.438 --> 17:32.193
I do not have an STD.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.936
- She does.
- No, I don't.

17:34.961 --> 17:36.519
W-Who is this guy?

17:36.544 --> 17:38.152
Leonard Bartholomew Goin.

17:38.177 --> 17:40.436
It's like "groin" without the "R."

17:40.898 --> 17:45.058
Why not say "it's like coin with a 'G'?"

17:45.077 --> 17:48.704
Wow. Where were you 60 years ago?

17:50.021 --> 17:53.138
Okay, Leonard, so you
need to get "Goin."

17:53.163 --> 17:54.852
That's the disease talking, baby.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.192
We can work through this.

17:56.217 --> 17:58.232
There is no "we."

17:58.257 --> 17:59.590
We slept together one time.

17:59.615 --> 18:00.906
We are not "we."

18:00.931 --> 18:02.650
I do not want to be with you, Leonard.

18:02.794 --> 18:04.554
- And I'm on a date.
- Oh?

18:05.656 --> 18:09.683
Oh. Oh.

18:11.479 --> 18:13.437
Oh.

18:13.555 --> 18:15.230
Okay.

18:16.725 --> 18:19.184
Look, I should probably go.

18:19.209 --> 18:22.740
No, no, no. Don't go.
I don't have an STD.

18:22.765 --> 18:23.993
Oh, please, I don't care about that.

18:24.017 --> 18:25.750
I've had everything.

18:26.510 --> 18:28.994
Were you gonna tell me?

18:30.456 --> 18:32.272
My issue...

18:32.291 --> 18:35.695
is that you slept with Leonard.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.904
Now, I knew you were not up to my level,

18:37.929 --> 18:41.055
but I thought you were
at least one level down.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.230
So... we done.

18:44.255 --> 18:46.697
Wait a minute. What
about how funny I am?

18:46.722 --> 18:48.806
Hey, you want to see me eat a dollar?

18:48.831 --> 18:51.173
Gene out.

18:54.805 --> 18:57.265
I'm, uh, sorry I gave you an STD.

18:57.290 --> 19:00.726
Oh, Charlie. Lower your voice.

19:00.751 --> 19:02.876
You'll bounce back.

19:02.901 --> 19:04.549
You're funny as hell,

19:04.574 --> 19:06.090
and you give the best advice,

19:06.115 --> 19:07.756
and that look you give men...

19:07.781 --> 19:10.008
Whoa.

19:10.033 --> 19:12.084
I couldn't get to sleep last night.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.758
Yep.

19:13.972 --> 19:15.852
I know this may feel like a low point,

19:15.877 --> 19:17.222
but, uh, it's not.

19:17.247 --> 19:18.746
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

19:19.181 --> 19:21.064
So, uh, what is this?

19:21.089 --> 19:22.339
What am I watching?

19:22.364 --> 19:24.973
Uh, Hank is going to be doing a reading

19:24.998 --> 19:26.879
from his erotic vampire novel.

19:27.648 --> 19:30.891
<i>Oh, so this is the low point.</i>

19:31.321 --> 19:33.280
Yeah, I'm needed backstage.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.274
Hank has me running special effects.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.456
Oh.

19:45.239 --> 19:47.422
Whoa.

19:47.424 --> 19:49.578
Sorry, I-I didn't realize
you were sitting here.

19:49.603 --> 19:51.795
- I could go somewhere else.
- N-No, wait.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.109
Leonard, it's okay. Sit down.

19:53.134 --> 19:55.094
Come on. Don't leave because of me.

19:58.435 --> 19:59.859
And I'm sorry I lashed out at you.

19:59.879 --> 20:03.622
I-It's not your fault. I know
I can come on a little strong.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.202
Probably need to up my game a little.

20:06.227 --> 20:07.536
Your game is just fine.

20:07.561 --> 20:09.522
It'll be perfect for the right person.

20:09.547 --> 20:12.733
Advice I should probably take myself.

20:12.758 --> 20:15.701
My point is, don't change who you are.

20:15.726 --> 20:18.352
I hear you loud and clear.

20:19.555 --> 20:21.823
Leonard!

20:36.082 --> 20:39.792
Oh, my God!

20:41.337 --> 20:43.770
"It was dark and hot

20:43.798 --> 20:47.591
as Shade made his way through the city.

20:47.616 --> 20:50.726
So dark, so hot.

20:50.751 --> 20:55.362
Shade and his orc sidekick
were covered in demon blood.

21:04.311 --> 21:05.653
But Shade didn't care.

21:05.678 --> 21:07.211
He didn't give a hoot,

21:07.236 --> 21:08.739
'cause he knew who was waiting for him

21:08.763 --> 21:12.223
when he gets back
home: Serena Williams.

21:12.248 --> 21:14.807
Oh, yeah.

21:14.832 --> 21:17.691
The city's about to get
even hotter tonight."

21:23.838 --> 21:27.080
They're loving your baby.

21:27.157 --> 21:29.758
I'm gonna be so friggin' rich!

21:31.366 --> 21:32.406
That's pretty good.
