WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.843
Sabine, fuel status.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.513
.05. We're almost down to fumes.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.847
Sorry, guys.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.225
Have to divert more power
from thermal subsystems.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.893
Reducing heat to two percent.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.021
Our intel on this fuel source
better be solid.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.232
I'm losing feeling in my fingers.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.650
Saw the report myself.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.318
Somewhere in this belt,
the Mining Guild's

00:27.403 --> 00:29.737
been refining Clouzon-36
for the Empire.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.573
One shipment of that stuff could fuel us

00:32.700 --> 00:35.368
and all the ships in Phoenix Squadron
for a full cycle.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.620
Empire is scheduled
to pick up their shipment today.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.123
We just have to get there
and find it first.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.960
The asteroid field
is scrambling our sensors.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.839
Well, I'm getting nothing
on the old visual scanners.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.969
All right. Cut the chatter.
Keep your eyes peeled for that refinery.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.054
Does anyone hear that noise?

00:56.140 --> 00:58.474
The only thing I hear
is my brain freezing.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.144
There. The noise. I hear it again.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.770
It's getting louder.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.524
I don't see anything out here.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.900
What's it sound like, Ezra?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.862
It's hard to describe.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.905
Kind of sad, I guess. But...

01:12.990 --> 01:15.658
I mean, how can you not hear it?
It's coming from all around us.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.746
Ezra, there's nothing to hear.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.290
Sabine, check the scanners again.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.876
Don't have to. Look.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.653
Brace yourselves!

02:05.751 --> 02:07.710
What the bloody blazes are those?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.086
Purrgils.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.047
They'll rip the hull apart.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.132
Prepare to fire.
We gotta drive them back.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.343
Don't shoot! They'll pass.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.928
Just let 'em do what they do.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.806
What they do is
destroy starships like ours.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.016
We can't waste power
fighting these things.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.267
What choice do we have?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.061
We could just get out of their way.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.814
We either run into them
or the asteroids. Take your pick.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.734
Try flying with them
instead of against them.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.903
That's not a half-bad idea.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.113
Fine. I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.074
It's not the strangest thing
we've ever done.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.534
Yeah, that doesn't make me feel better.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.095
I think they're calming down.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.847
I'm not hearing them.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.813
That was a good instinct, Ezra.
How did you know?

03:08.939 --> 03:10.982
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.569
Okay, we're low on fuel,
surrounded by asteroids,

03:14.653 --> 03:16.195
and caught in a swarm of purrgil.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.364
How has the situation improved
exactly?

03:24.955 --> 03:26.789
Hello? Are we shooting them or not?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.292
'Cause here comes a really big one.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.716
These creatures are amazing.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.384
Who would want to shoot them?

03:38.468 --> 03:39.886
Hera, if you gave her the chance.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.388
Kanan, you don't know
what you're talking about. I do.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.683
Well, since I'm so uneducated,
why don't you explain your problem?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.644
These creatures are a menace.
A big, lumbering menace.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.775
Something's upsetting it.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.068
Maybe it's Hera.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.494
No, it's not Hera.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.538
TIE fighters. Two of 'em.
I need a better angle.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.417
Hang on!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.555
Those TIEs have been modified.
They're not Imperial.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.265
Well, they're acting like it.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.313
I've got him. I've got him.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.358
Hera, I lost my cannons.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.693
Rerouting auxiliary power
from The Phantom.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.365
Karabast!

04:47.204 --> 04:48.204
Hera!

04:57.547 --> 05:00.383
See? lf we shot at the purrgil,
we wouldn't have had...

05:01.468 --> 05:03.052
Those fighters were Mining Guild.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.137
They must be from the refinery.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.889
You think you can track
where they came from?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.432
Maybe. Give me a minute.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.897
As I was saying, it's a good thing

05:14.982 --> 05:17.400
we didn't waste energy
shooting at the purrgil.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.026
I heard you the first time.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.748
Something's happening.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.006
They're turning around.
I think we should follow them.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.633
Following them is
the last thing we should do.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.678
Sabine, did you find out
where the fighters came from yet?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.097
-I did.
-Good. What's our heading?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.932
-Follow the purrgil.
-What?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.350
Yeah, I hate to tell you this,

05:51.435 --> 05:54.770
but the purrgil are heading right where
I calculated those fighters came from.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.273
That's so interesting.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.943
All right. I guess for now
we follow the purrgil.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.447
Hey. For what it's worth,
I've got a good feeling about this.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.964
Go check your cabins.
Make sure everything is switched off.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.258
We've gotta save every little bit of fuel.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.554
Come on, big guy.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.057
It's colder back there.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.065
I never imagined there were
creatures in deep space.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.151
When I was young,
I was told amazing stories

06:42.235 --> 06:44.070
of creatures that lived in the stars,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.322
traveled between the worlds.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.074
Old pilots said it was the purrgil

06:48.158 --> 06:50.493
who inspired us to jump
from system to system.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.704
But I don't believe it.
The purrgil are dangerous.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.957
They wander into hyperspace lanes,
crash into ships.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.210
I've lost more than one friend that way.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.005
Well, maybe they don't realize
they're putting people in danger.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.257
Maybe it's like Kanan says, you know.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.592
They just do what they do.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.470
Right now, as long as they don't come
between me and my mission,

07:09.554 --> 07:10.971
I really don't care what they do.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.224
Fair enough.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.150
Scanners are picking up
an energy source

07:23.235 --> 07:24.610
from that planetoid ahead.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.028
You think it's the refinery?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.114
We're about to find out.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.708
There it is. The refinery.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.961
I wonder why the purrgil
are headed that way.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.254
Works out for us.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.797
Between them and all these asteroids,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.632
the Mining Guild
will never see us coming.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.723
The automatic doors
aren't so automatic anymore.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.767
I've rationed what energy we have left.

07:56.935 --> 07:57.935
What's your next move?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.354
I want to get a secure position
to plan our attack.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.816
Sabine, Chopper, ready a short,
controlled burst from the engines.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.027
ln three, two, one.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.487
Now!

08:26.673 --> 08:30.843
Okay. So how exactly are we gonna pull
off this raid with our limited resources?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.720
Well, give me a second and I'll tell you.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.140
Okay. More fighters. That's not good.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.269
Anti-ship cannon, also not good. But...

08:41.313 --> 08:42.521
There's the Empire's shipment.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.231
Okay, lots of guards around,

08:44.316 --> 08:47.026
but I think we can drop down there,
scoop it up and go.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.194
Forget the scoop job.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.196
We have just barely
enough fuel to get down there.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.322
We'll have to land.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.073
Refuel on the platform?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.701
They'll blast us to bits.
We need a diversion.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.827
I've got one.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.955
The gas in that pool
is unrefined Clouzon-36.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.041
Highly explosive in its pure form.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.459
We drop in a few charges,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.794
the blast will provide
all the diversion we need.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.963
ln the chaos, we grab the fuel.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.715
And that huge fireball will destroy

09:09.799 --> 09:11.717
the Empire's ability to refine more.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.345
I like it. Ezra, you hear the plan?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.180
Yeah. Sure.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.850
They're using the cannon
to shoot the purrgil.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.018
Why would they bother?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.854
Speaking of, how do we
get past that gun undetected?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.731
-We jump.
-Excuse me?

09:25.941 --> 09:27.149
We're in the upper atmosphere.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.567
We can glide in on the catwalk.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.445
With all the purrgil around,
we can probably slip by unseen.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.530
Sounds like a dangerous plan.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.699
Don't worry, buddy.
You're staying here.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.410
Sounds like a good plan.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.747
The purrgil and the gas are connected.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.332
Hey, guys?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.501
Not now, Ezra.
You've gotta prep for the mission.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.628
But I think the purrgil want the fuel.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.046
Well, so do we.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.131
Get going.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.014
Why are those flying leeches back?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.016
I sent two fighters to destroy them.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.645
Pilots haven't reported in, sir.
Perhaps they've run into trouble.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.106
These creatures have eaten
enough of our fuel.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.316
I don't want to hear
our cannons stop firing

10:09.401 --> 10:11.402
until all of those things are dead.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.452
Sabine, do you have the helmet
I lent you?

10:22.914 --> 10:24.081
What?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.375
You said you just wanted to look at it.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.836
I did look at it. And it looked bad.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.214
I think it looks great.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.595
Wait. We're not taking The Phantom?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.723
You know, you should
really pay more attention.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.975
-How are we getting down there?
-Like Kanan said.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.435
We jump.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.765
Five seconds.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.077
No. No! No!

11:56.841 --> 11:58.175
I'm gonna have to work on that.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.676
I'm gonna make sure you do.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.303
Look out!

12:04.224 --> 12:05.474
So much for our stealth mission.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.059
Sabine, toss the detonators.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.685
I'm on it.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.313
Detonators?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.693
Ezra, are you crazy?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.905
We can't blow up the gas!

12:19.989 --> 12:21.782
Don't tell me this is about the purrgil.

12:21.950 --> 12:22.991
It is.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.660
Hold that thought. Sabine!

12:32.085 --> 12:33.127
Hey.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.923
Okay. Explain yourself.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.967
Okay. The gas and the purrgil
are connected.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.010
We can't blow up the gas
without hurting them.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.222
Kanan, what's the plan?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.642
I trust your instincts, kid.
Now, get on that cannon and cover us.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.269
What exactly are we doing?

12:50.353 --> 12:52.688
We're going to secure the landing zone.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.072
There's no explosion.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.740
How come there's no explosion?

13:04.242 --> 13:05.659
Sabine, what's going on?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.536
We're improvising, again.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.746
Kanan and I
are securing the landing zone

13:09.831 --> 13:11.540
while Ezra covers us with the cannon.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.875
Who changed the plan?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.710
The purrgil changed the plan.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.295
Not the purrgil again.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.505
Are you sure you can
secure the landing platform?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.924
Once I start heading down there,
I can't turn back.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.178
Hera, if you're looking for a guarantee,
you are on the wrong mission.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.138
We'll contact you
when the platform is clear.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.558
Next time, we just plan on
the plan changing.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.064
Boss Yushyn, we have intruders
on the patrol bridge.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.567
Fuel thieves. Alert our sentries.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.403
Protect the shipment at all costs.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.582
Where's my cover fire?

13:53.750 --> 13:54.791
Working on it.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.799
Careful! Don't hit the fuel.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.852
Hera, you better get down here.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.938
Your landing zone
is temporarily secure.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.106
Then it's a good thing we're here.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.281
I'll get the fuel.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.449
Make it fast.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.703
They're back.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.724
Spectre-6, do you copy?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.142
Kanan, I figured it out.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.644
You're not going to believe this.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.938
I believe I need more cover fire!

15:02.986 --> 15:04.653
Yes! Right. Sorry.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.181
Launch fighters.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.063
I thought you said
the landing platform was secure.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.691
Temporarily. I said,
"Temporarily secure."

15:42.859 --> 15:44.192
Refuel commencing.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.071
Come on, come on.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.754
We've got fighters. Ezra.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.839
Ezra!

16:06.341 --> 16:07.841
Ezra, where are you?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.178
Ezra? Come in, Ezra!

16:34.911 --> 16:37.412
Help, help me.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.255
I understand.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.467
We want to help you.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.930
Let us help you.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.294
Thank...

17:27.171 --> 17:30.841
Thank you. You saved my life.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.721
We need to find Ezra.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.806
Without fuel, we can't find anybody.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.102
Ezra's down.
We need to get out of here.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.729
Just a few more seconds.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.608
Time's up.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.824
Surrender, thieves.
You are at my mercy.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.076
I can't believe
we're gonna lose to this guy.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.245
What is your answer?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.831
Kanan, don't worry.
We'll be right there.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
"We"?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.884
I don't believe it.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.521
We found Ezra.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.026
Blast those disgusting things!

18:51.297 --> 18:53.381
-How's the Ghost?
-We're back in action.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.551
This is the last one. Go. Go!

19:03.559 --> 19:05.977
Forget the beasts. Stop that ship!

19:16.239 --> 19:18.031
Hold them off. I'll cover you.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.919
Keep away. Keep away!

20:33.357 --> 20:36.359
It wasn't like anything
I've ever experienced.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.944
I could see what they were thinking.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.155
You must have established
a deep connection with them.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.448
I guess so.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.284
I could see they need gas
to breathe and travel.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.913
The crater wasn't their home,
just one stop on a long journey.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.878
I have to admit,
without the help of the purrgil,

20:55.046 --> 20:57.047
we never would have gotten
off the ground again.

20:59.634 --> 21:00.675
Look.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.640
Can it be?

21:15.983 --> 21:19.069
It is true.
They can travel through hyperspace.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.363
We better get moving, too.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.198
Back to the fleet?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.367
How 'bout we follow the purrgil?
