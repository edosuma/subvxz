WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:04.536
<i>Previously on</i> "Tyrant"...
(Jamal) I don't really like

00:04.538 --> 00:05.704
being president.

00:05.705 --> 00:09.541
I would walk away
from all of this.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.910
That situation that
you wanted me to handle...

00:11.912 --> 00:12.912
it's done.

00:12.913 --> 00:13.913
Thank you.

00:13.914 --> 00:18.216
Are you getting
the plane ready?

00:18.218 --> 00:19.218
(shriek)

00:19.219 --> 00:21.553
(Barry) There will be no peace
in Abbudin with my brother in

00:21.555 --> 00:22.888
power. He has to be removed.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.690
So you want to have a
coup, oust your own brother?

00:25.990 --> 00:28.720
Many of us have
dreaded the day your brother

00:28.720 --> 00:29.720
took power.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.580
(Barry) What is this place?

00:30.590 --> 00:32.430
Just a haven
for weary travelers.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.430
Lea Exley.

00:33.430 --> 00:36.560
The coup's got about a week
between inception and execution.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.760
And what about the
money and the media?

00:37.770 --> 00:38.770
Hakim Bata.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.190
Do you really want to bet

00:40.490 --> 00:42.720
your family and your
country on my brother?

00:42.720 --> 00:43.840
Then we all just go back?

00:43.840 --> 00:45.070
Just you,
Jenna and the kids.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.240
No, we're not
going without you.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.410
Why would you stay here if
Jamal won't even be president?

00:48.410 --> 00:49.790
There's nothing you can do.

00:49.790 --> 00:53.240
Molly, I'm
taking his place.

00:54.950 --> 00:58.050
(water running and splashing)

01:05.260 --> 01:07.330
♪♪

01:25.650 --> 01:28.750
(Molly sighs)

01:29.350 --> 01:34.750
You should, uh,
probably get dressed.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.160
It's like a bad
dream and I can't wake up.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.500
In three days,
it'll all be over, okay?

01:44.500 --> 01:45.500
Please.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.440
Don't make me lie
to their faces.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.520
Jamal's throwing this
dinner for our anniversary.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.840
How's it gonna look
if I show up alone?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.610
Tell them I'm sick.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.350
Tell them anything you want,
just don't make me do this.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.350
Molly, at this stage, anything

02:01.350 --> 02:05.120
- that arouses suspicion...
- And you're worried about your coup.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.449
I'm worried
about our kids.

02:19.470 --> 02:22.300
(Ziad) I didn't join in this
because I want things to change.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.140
That's not why I'm here.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.970
I'm here because a change will
happen regardless of what

02:26.980 --> 02:27.980
I want.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.810
And the last man who is ever
gonna allow this change

02:30.810 --> 02:32.610
is General Tariq.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.120
If you want to move
against your brother,

02:34.120 --> 02:35.550
you need to remove Tariq.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.870
(Barry sighs) Which means removing a
hundred-and-something members

02:38.870 --> 02:39.950
of his Elite Guard.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.290
How the hell do we do that?

02:41.290 --> 02:42.990
(John) Jamal.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.320
(Barry) Jamal?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.960
Make him believe
Tariq's behind the coup.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.290
Considering how loud Tariq's

02:48.300 --> 02:51.300
been about these elections,
that shouldn't be too hard.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.400
And we have
enough truth working

02:54.400 --> 02:56.740
for us to help sell the lie.

02:56.740 --> 03:00.310
What truth?

03:00.310 --> 03:05.750
When Sheik Rashid was
comatose in the hospital...

03:05.750 --> 03:07.950
Jamal spent time with a friend.

03:07.950 --> 03:10.750
Katerina.

03:11.050 --> 03:12.750
(scoffs) Well, add it

03:12.750 --> 03:15.450
to the long list of my brother's
questionable life choices.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.320
How does that undermine Tariq?

03:17.330 --> 03:20.590
I have a recording of
a compromising conversation

03:20.600 --> 03:25.030
between your brother and
this woman, Katerina.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.030
You've been
spying on my brother?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.170
For Tariq.

03:28.170 --> 03:31.940
(chuckles) It's a little
late to get protective,

03:31.940 --> 03:33.610
don't you think?

03:33.610 --> 03:35.750
And before you get all
bent out of shape...

03:35.750 --> 03:39.510
(inhaling) maybe
you should listen.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.780
Finally!

03:42.780 --> 03:44.850
I could eat my foot.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.850
(classical music playing in background)

03:51.290 --> 03:54.960
(Nunez) Mr. President, tonight
I have prepared for you

03:54.960 --> 04:00.600
a starter of lemon soup with
edible wood cream cheese.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.700
<i>Rapido.</i>
(covers clinking loudly)

04:08.140 --> 04:10.140
The wood itself is unique.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.210
It has a sponge-like quality.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.120
And I have soaked it
in honey overnight.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.220
The Yacaratiá tree
is very rare.

04:17.220 --> 04:20.149
It only grows in the inner
Parana Forest and is

04:20.160 --> 04:21.820
only available in Argentina.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.820
Until tonight.

04:22.820 --> 04:23.720
<i> Si.</i>

04:23.720 --> 04:26.590
Nothing but
the best for my brother

04:26.590 --> 04:30.200
and his beautiful bride.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.900
(Nunez) Please, enjoy.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.170
Look at us.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.100
A double date.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.170
What took so long?

04:38.170 --> 04:40.940
Well, your plate's
been pretty full.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.840
Ah.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.410
Never too full for family.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.620
(Leila) Are you
all right, Molly?

04:54.620 --> 04:56.690
You look pale.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.030
Uh... (clears throat)

05:01.060 --> 05:04.800
I was born that way. (laughs)

05:04.800 --> 05:05.970
I'm fine.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.300
Everything's wonderful.

05:08.300 --> 05:13.540
Mmm, yeah, it tastes of, um...
tastes of lemon.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.450
(Jamal's voice recorded) That's
good, because I don't really

05:20.450 --> 05:22.950
like being president.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.290
I don't think it's good for me.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.320
(sighs)

05:26.320 --> 05:27.950
I'm not very good at it.

05:27.950 --> 05:29.320
(Katerina's voice) I don't think that's true.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.290
(Jamal) What I really want,
Katerina, is just to be

05:33.300 --> 05:39.970
left alone, to sit on a beach,
drink tequila and enjoy

05:39.970 --> 05:44.410
the company of a beautiful woman
whom I love and loves me.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.310
(Katerina) Mmm.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.470
Yeah, that sounds good, too.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.480
(Jamal) Would you
come with me?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.980
(Katerina) Stop teasing me.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.650
(Jamal) I'm not teasing you.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.920
I would walk away from all

05:54.920 --> 05:59.520
of this in-in a heartbeat
and never look back.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.890
- (Jamal) Have you ever been to the Maldives?
- (Katerina) Maldives?!

06:03.890 --> 06:06.190
(John) This is what we tell
your brother Tariq's been

06:06.190 --> 06:08.690
spreading to his officers.

06:11.630 --> 06:16.540
(Jamal) And just like that, my
brother was off the market.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.640
A married man.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.740
Not just married.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.640
Eloped with Molly Olsen.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.050
An American blonde.

06:26.050 --> 06:31.150
Now let me tell you, hearts
broke that day in Abbudin.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.650
Remember what you said, Bassam,

06:33.660 --> 06:36.390
the night you called to tell me?

06:36.390 --> 06:40.790
You said... you had
found a woman who

06:40.800 --> 06:45.030
accepted you for who
you really are.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.970
Moralistic.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.580
Self-righteous.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.410
Holier-than-thou.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.680
Jamal.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.780
But also protective.

07:01.780 --> 07:02.920
Wise.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.590
And most important: loyal.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.990
(Barry) So we poison the well
between Jamal and Tariq.

07:12.990 --> 07:14.190
Then what?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.930
Tariq and his Elite Guard...
Their annual retreat

07:16.930 --> 07:19.700
to Wadi Ganoub is in three days.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.540
They'll all be in the
same place at the same time.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.300
Easy to lock down.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.210
So that's your play.

07:27.210 --> 07:31.210
You have three days to
turn Jamal against Tariq.

07:40.490 --> 07:44.490
(Jamal) So, to my brother and
the woman who makes him a

07:44.490 --> 07:46.560
better man.

07:58.140 --> 08:01.870
Want to smoke a cigar with me?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.940
Sure.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.590
I can ask them to
make you a hamburger.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.660
What? No.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.460
(scoffs) No, thank you.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.830
I... I'm... so tired.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.630
I pulled a double shift
at the hospital.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.160
I... I'm still recovering.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.630
I guess
I'm not 20 anymore, huh?

08:26.630 --> 08:28.630
Not to worry.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.300
There'll be many more
nights like this.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.640
Birthdays, victories.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.080
More reasons to celebrate
together with family.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.650
(lighter clicks)

08:40.650 --> 08:47.490
If you can't get away to Cuba...
bring Cuba to you.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.090
Hmm.

08:50.090 --> 08:54.530
Speaking of travel plans,
this military retreat to Wadi

08:54.530 --> 08:57.130
Ganoub... are you, uh...
are you planning to go?

08:57.130 --> 09:01.100
And watch them
march circles in the sun?

09:01.100 --> 09:03.740
No, thank you.

09:06.210 --> 09:09.110
Maybe, uh...
Maybe I should go.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.840
You?

09:10.850 --> 09:13.610
Why?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.880
You know what, forget it.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.950
Tell me.

09:19.890 --> 09:23.120
Well, I was just thinking,
um, maybe we should have

09:23.120 --> 09:24.960
a presence there, you know.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.290
Eyes and ears.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.290
Mm.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.030
That's what I have Tariq for.

09:29.030 --> 09:33.300
Why do I need eyes and
ears on my own men?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.300
You're right.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.370
It's nothing.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.680
Now I know
it's something.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.150
Tell me.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.480
If some of your own men are...
are questioning

09:49.480 --> 09:53.450
your fitness to lead, then...
then we need to address it.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.520
Questioning my what?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.460
Who told you this?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.600
(Barry sighs)

10:09.600 --> 10:12.070
It was John Tucker.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.440
Bring the Amriki here.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.280
I want to hear him
say this to my face.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.880
Okay,
I'll, uh... I'll set up

10:21.880 --> 10:23.020
a meeting
for tomorrow morning.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.280
No.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.350
Now.

10:35.350 --> 10:38.350
(sighs)

11:49.750 --> 11:54.330
Tyrant S01E09
"Gaslight"

11:54.330 --> 12:04.330
Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

12:08.090 --> 12:10.090
(door opens)

12:10.090 --> 12:11.360
(Molly) I feel sick.

12:11.660 --> 12:14.890
I'm trying to see things from
your perspective, Barry.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.930
I really am.

12:15.930 --> 12:19.230
I mean, I watched you and
Jamal laughing, and I tried.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.830
I... I tried to be like that, but

12:20.840 --> 12:22.640
Leila kept talking to me about

12:22.640 --> 12:23.880
wanting to spend more time with

12:23.900 --> 12:24.840
me and the kids, and

12:24.840 --> 12:27.640
all I could think was,
what's gonna happen to her?

12:27.640 --> 12:29.640
She will be fine, okay?

12:29.640 --> 12:31.650
They both get asylum
in a neutral country.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.150
And if Jamal cooperates, they
keep their money and their dignity.

12:34.150 --> 12:35.430
This is a coup, Barry,

12:35.430 --> 12:37.630
not the changing of the
guard at Buckingham Palace.

12:37.630 --> 12:38.850
People will die.

12:38.850 --> 12:42.620
Molly, what matters now
is getting you and the kids

12:42.620 --> 12:44.990
back to the U.S. Okay?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.330
I need you to sit down

12:52.330 --> 12:56.370
with JohnTucker and go through
visas, protocol and the itinerary,

12:56.370 --> 12:58.140
okay?

12:58.140 --> 13:01.640
You know what freaks
me out more than anything?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.710
How good you are at this.

13:04.710 --> 13:08.550
How easily this comes to you.

13:08.550 --> 13:11.120
The lying.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.560
I have to go.

13:19.750 --> 13:23.560
(footsteps departing)

13:23.560 --> 13:27.560
(door opens and closes)

13:30.050 --> 13:33.560
(Jamal patting on leg)

13:33.560 --> 13:35.560
(doors bangs)

13:36.180 --> 13:39.480
(sighs) I hope this is,
uh, worth the Ambien

13:39.480 --> 13:42.980
I had to spit out
to get over here. (pats on leg)

13:42.990 --> 13:45.990
What shit has hit what fan?

13:45.990 --> 13:50.190
What is this about my
generals questioning my fitness

13:50.190 --> 13:52.730
for office?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.500
You told him that?

13:57.500 --> 14:00.170
(Jamal) My brother's got my back.

14:00.170 --> 14:04.170
More than I can say about
my so-called allies.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.510
No, no, no, no.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.170
We were shooting the shit.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.180
I had a few too many Abbudin

14:10.180 --> 14:11.510
libres, and I repeated something

14:11.510 --> 14:15.050
that I obviously should not
have in front of... no offense,

14:15.050 --> 14:18.120
Barry... an
inexperienced civilian.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.020
Repeated what?

14:20.020 --> 14:23.520
Grumblings and
grousing, the stuff of

14:23.530 --> 14:25.960
subordinates everywhere.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.700
I thought Barry understood
that it was just gossip.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.800
Gossip about what?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.700
We should
speak in private.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.200
Listen, anything you
have to say, you can say

14:35.200 --> 14:37.700
in front of my brother.

14:42.710 --> 14:48.650
Well, uh, some rumor
about you and a hooker.

14:48.650 --> 14:52.320
I just... I feel ridiculous
even repeating this.

14:52.320 --> 14:58.090
(sighs) Um... that when
the sheik was in the hospital,

14:58.090 --> 15:00.890
you were looking to
run off with... this hooker

15:00.900 --> 15:04.730
to the Maldives
or some damn place.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.750
(Jamal laughs)

15:19.750 --> 15:22.420
I told you, it's laughable.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.150
Uh...

15:33.030 --> 15:35.500
Who told you this?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
One of my sources.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.770
You mean one
of your spies.

15:42.870 --> 15:45.270
Bring him here, and I will deal

15:45.270 --> 15:47.340
with him spreading such a story.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.540
(John) He wasn't spreading
it, he was reporting it.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.840
And I don't burn
my sources, Mr. President.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.420
I'm breaking protocol
even sharing that much.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.650
It's nothing.

15:57.650 --> 16:02.220
It's a rumor that's gonna
be forgotten in a week.

16:02.220 --> 16:06.490
Well... (clears throat)
thank you, John.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.300
That's all I need to know.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.730
(sighs, chuckles)

16:13.740 --> 16:19.470
Listen, um... I wouldn't
lose any sleep over this.

16:22.310 --> 16:24.180
That will be all.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.810
Go back to sleep.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.220
Mr. President.

16:37.990 --> 16:41.730
(door opens, closes)

16:46.030 --> 16:50.540
High-ranking officers are
using this to discredit me.

16:50.540 --> 16:54.040
Well, then call in
Tariq, ask him directly.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.510
No, no, no, no, no.

16:55.510 --> 16:56.840
Why not?

16:56.850 --> 16:59.250
We're talking about
his Elite Guard.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.850
Who won't scratch their
balls without clearing it

17:02.850 --> 17:04.280
with him first.

17:04.290 --> 17:09.390
They wouldn't gossip about me
without his tacit approval.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.490
So what are you saying?

17:12.490 --> 17:15.660
Opposing these
elections to my face is one thing

17:15.660 --> 17:21.069
but spreading
rumors behind my back?

17:21.069 --> 17:26.410
Tariq wouldn't do that
unless he had a reason.

17:26.410 --> 17:27.640
(sighs)

17:27.640 --> 17:29.980
Father never trusted him.

17:29.980 --> 17:35.350
He was always looking
over his shoulder.

17:35.350 --> 17:36.990
Look...

17:36.990 --> 17:39.790
I'm... I'm sure there's
an explanation for all of this.

17:39.790 --> 17:45.220
(sighs deeply) Bassam, you are not
the one he is plotting against.

17:45.230 --> 17:49.260
Jamal, uh, I'm the last
person to defend our uncle, but...

17:49.260 --> 17:52.400
planning a military coup?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.340
Okay, I'll, um... I'll do some

17:58.340 --> 17:59.740
digging around, see if there's

17:59.740 --> 18:01.910
anything unusual or suspicious.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.880
But... don't jump
to any conclusions.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.950
Please.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.550
(door opens, closes)
Jamal's definitely rattled about Tariq.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.620
He's running around
checking the Palace for bugs.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.120
(panting) I may have been followed.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.690
But you lost them.

18:50.690 --> 18:51.920
I think so.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.190
You think so?

18:53.190 --> 18:56.360
(Ziad) If you were unsure,
why did you come?

18:56.660 --> 18:57.900
I could be wrong.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.100
About having ditched them?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.600
About being followed.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.040
It's all right.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.340
Sit down.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.510
Is everything in place to
jam the Internet servers and

19:12.510 --> 19:15.180
the cell towers at our
military retreat?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.850
All is set.

19:16.850 --> 19:19.680
Now, please, catch me up.

19:19.690 --> 19:22.550
Tariq has summoned
a dozen tribal leaders.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.860
He plans to recruit them.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.360
For what?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.860
For his plan
to rig the election.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.960
He's basically
buying their votes.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.660
Which we're gonna make

19:31.670 --> 19:36.270
Jamal believe is Tariq securing
their support for a coup.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.270
Look, we're all nervous.

19:40.270 --> 19:43.980
We're all taking a risk, but
we're taking it together.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.510
You all right?

19:53.990 --> 19:57.890
(Yussef) The bids for the
desalination plant have come in.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.990
Let me guess,
they are too high.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.370
'Cause they
know you have oil.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.300
Tell them they either
lower their bids or we accept

20:12.310 --> 20:13.640
one, let them build it,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.910
then nationalize it and toss
them out on their ass.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.340
Anything else?

20:19.350 --> 20:23.200
- I... uh...
- Come on, Yussef, I haven't

20:23.230 --> 20:25.320
got all day.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.320
It's come to my
attention that your uncle

20:28.320 --> 20:31.660
has been reaching out
to tribal leaders.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.330
As I am official liaison to the

20:34.330 --> 20:39.300
tribes, I was contacted by one
who was confused about this

20:39.300 --> 20:41.300
change in protocol.

20:41.300 --> 20:45.740
Am I being relieved of
the tribal portfolio?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.410
Not at all.

20:50.410 --> 20:55.010
I asked my uncle, uh, to do
this, unofficially, for reasons

20:55.020 --> 20:58.200
I can't discuss.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.270
I see.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.850
(Jamal) I have only the
greatest continuing confidence

21:02.850 --> 21:05.330
in your service, exactly
as my father did.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.690
I'm relieved to hear it.

21:07.700 --> 21:14.430
- So, if that's all...
- Thank you, Mr. President.

21:22.210 --> 21:25.980
Why is Tariq contacting
tribal leaders,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.360
and why the secrecy?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.360
I'll find out.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.720
I'll tell you why.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.390
To line up their support
for my overthrow.

21:33.390 --> 21:37.290
The whisper campaign, now this
secret outreach... you still

21:37.290 --> 21:39.390
think he's not
plotting against me?

21:39.390 --> 21:40.780
I don't know
what to think.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.260
It's probably nothing, but we
need to be cautious.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.370
We don't want to tip our hand.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.200
I'll press Tucker
for his source.

21:56.280 --> 22:00.950
I am relying
on you, brother.

22:00.950 --> 22:04.480
You are the only
one I can trust.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.550
You know that.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.250
(hinges creaks)

22:24.750 --> 22:27.750
(crickets chirping)

22:33.980 --> 22:36.850
(sighs)

22:36.850 --> 22:40.320
Jamal, what it is so important
you wanted me to meet you

22:40.320 --> 22:43.490
all the way out here?

22:43.490 --> 22:45.660
Did anyone follow you?

22:45.660 --> 22:47.590
What?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.530
What's going on, Jamal?

22:50.530 --> 22:52.130
Last night you were joking and

22:52.130 --> 22:54.030
kidding at dinner, then you went off

22:54.030 --> 22:55.530
to talk to Bassam, and then you had

22:55.540 --> 22:57.140
the late meeting with Tucker.

22:57.140 --> 23:01.470
- Shh, shh...
- What's going on?

23:01.470 --> 23:05.210
- Uh...
- What are you doing?

23:05.210 --> 23:08.380
(removes cell phone battery)
I need to make sure no one is listening.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.570
Why? We have
people for that.

23:10.570 --> 23:13.670
No one I can trust.

23:13.670 --> 23:15.000
Come, sit.

23:15.010 --> 23:18.840
- (Jamal sniffles and sighs)
- You're scaring me, Jamal.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.910
Sit.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.180
You are being paranoid.

23:28.190 --> 23:32.850
I'm being careful,
and you should be, too.

23:32.860 --> 23:35.920
Why? What's happening?

23:35.930 --> 23:39.660
We have enemies
inside the Palace.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.100
I will tell you
when I know more.

23:45.100 --> 23:51.340
Until then, be carefu
l what you say and... trust no one.

24:01.450 --> 24:04.220
Bassam, how do you know
this isn't part of Tariq's

24:04.220 --> 24:08.120
plan, getting me out in the
middle of nowhere so he...

24:08.120 --> 24:08.830
he can kill me?

24:08.830 --> 24:10.730
Ziad's on our side, okay?

24:10.730 --> 24:12.890
He went to Tucker because
he's opposed to what

24:12.900 --> 24:13.900
Tariq's planning.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.080
Why didn't he tell me?

24:15.100 --> 24:16.130
He'll explain.

24:16.130 --> 24:21.070
And if you don't
trust him, trust me.

24:21.070 --> 24:23.540
I trust this.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.050
(gun clicks, cylinder rolling)

24:27.550 --> 24:31.550
(traffic noise)
(children chatting)

24:35.550 --> 24:38.550
(dog barking in distance)

24:38.890 --> 24:40.200
See? He's on his own.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.290
You can put the gun away.

24:41.290 --> 24:42.390
Wait here. (sighs)

24:42.390 --> 24:44.190
Look, let
me come with you.

24:44.190 --> 24:47.900
No. I need the
quiet of my own counsel.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.900
(barking continues)

24:56.550 --> 24:59.550
(insect buzzing)

25:00.550 --> 25:03.550
(traffic noise in distance)

25:11.520 --> 25:13.720
Why should I trust you?

25:13.720 --> 25:16.360
It's your choice, Mr. President.

25:16.360 --> 25:19.260
All I can tell you is the truth.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.470
Tell me, what does my
uncle want with these

25:26.470 --> 25:27.970
tribal leaders?

25:27.970 --> 25:30.640
He is bringing them to
the retreat in the desert,

25:30.640 --> 25:32.640
where, either by bribe or force,

25:32.640 --> 25:36.240
he will enlist their support
for his plan to unseat

25:36.250 --> 25:38.650
you and install himself.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.250
You have been Tariq's

25:42.250 --> 25:46.650
right hand... why not
stand with him in this?

25:46.660 --> 25:49.890
Look around you.

25:49.890 --> 25:53.830
All of this is ruin of the past.

25:53.830 --> 25:56.330
That's his way.

25:56.330 --> 25:58.670
Your way is about the future.

25:58.670 --> 26:03.400
A future I want for my country,
my people, my children.

26:30.330 --> 26:34.600
Do you have officers you
can enlist... men you trust?

26:34.600 --> 26:36.100
I do.

26:36.110 --> 26:37.270
How many?

26:37.270 --> 26:39.610
Enough to do
whatever is required.

26:39.610 --> 26:42.680
Once Tariq and his
Elite Guard arrive

26:42.680 --> 26:46.550
at the military retreat, lock them
down, at which point,

26:46.550 --> 26:51.290
you will assume my uncle's position
as head of Abbudin's military.

26:51.290 --> 26:55.290
(dog barking in distance)

27:05.350 --> 27:08.170
(car doors open, close)

27:08.170 --> 27:10.170
(Jenna laughing)

27:10.470 --> 27:12.260
(Emma) Isn't that weird, though?

27:12.260 --> 27:14.840
- (Jenna laughing) Yeah, so weird.
- (Emma) I know.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.650
Oh, hey, Mom,
um, so I'm wearing

27:18.650 --> 27:22.980
yellow underwear, I'm in love
with my math teacher, and

27:22.990 --> 27:25.650
I'm gonna go trekking around
the world with Aunt Jenna.

27:25.660 --> 27:26.820
(whoops)

27:26.820 --> 27:27.820
- (Emma chuckles)
- (Jenna) It's a game.

27:27.970 --> 27:29.980
(Emma) It's called
two truths and one lie. You do it.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.280
Jenna, I need your passport...
I have a meeting at the embassy

27:32.290 --> 27:35.920
tomorrow to expedite
our exit visas.

27:37.950 --> 27:38.950
Be right back.

27:38.950 --> 27:39.620
(clears throat)

27:39.620 --> 27:41.450
Molly.

27:41.450 --> 27:44.510
Listen, the more I think about
going back with you guys,

27:44.510 --> 27:45.620
the crazier it seems.

27:45.820 --> 27:46.820
Why can't I just stay?

27:46.830 --> 27:48.870
- It's not like there's not...
- We've already been through this.

27:48.870 --> 27:50.930
You've been through this.

27:50.930 --> 27:54.060
Mol, is there something
you're not telling me?

27:54.070 --> 27:57.440
Because you're...
you're not yourself.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.740
Is something going on
with you and Barry?

28:02.740 --> 28:04.730
I mean, I suck at relationships,
but you'd have to be...

28:04.730 --> 28:06.810
Shut your mouth.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.450
I mean it, Jenna.

28:11.450 --> 28:12.850
We're not in America, so just

28:12.850 --> 28:16.320
keep your mouth shut and
get me your passport.

28:25.530 --> 28:27.770
(Leila) Bassam?

28:31.870 --> 28:34.210
You have to tell me what
happened between you and Jamal

28:34.210 --> 28:35.940
the other night.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.640
What makes you
think something happened?

28:38.640 --> 28:41.060
Don't play games
with me, Bassam.

28:41.060 --> 28:45.330
Jamal is many things, but
he's never been paranoid.

28:45.330 --> 28:46.600
Either you tell me what's going on,

28:46.600 --> 28:51.410
or I will find
someone who will.

28:51.410 --> 28:53.470
What?

28:55.510 --> 28:57.870
Members of the Elite
Guard may be plotting against him.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.330
I don't believe it.

29:01.330 --> 29:04.840
Anyway, Tariq would squash that.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.710
Tariq's behind it.

29:07.710 --> 29:10.370
That's insane. (sighs)

29:10.370 --> 29:13.110
Tariq has promised Khaled
he would watch over Jamal.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.110
He would never do this.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.380
Do you know that?

29:16.380 --> 29:18.720
I know Tariq.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.120
Maybe not as
well as you think.

29:22.120 --> 29:26.890
Tariq's been questioning
Jamal's capacity to lead.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.460
Based on what?

29:35.270 --> 29:38.600
Don't pretend there's some
indignity too great

29:38.610 --> 29:41.110
for me to bear.

29:41.110 --> 29:43.840
Not at this point, Bassam.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.510
The rumor is,
Jamal's been with a woman.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.290
(scoffs) That wouldn't
be the first time.

29:54.290 --> 29:57.190
He was with her that
day the sheik

29:57.190 --> 29:58.690
was in the hospital.

29:58.690 --> 30:01.690
Tariq claims to have a recording

30:01.690 --> 30:03.290
of Jamal telling her that

30:03.300 --> 30:04.630
he never wanted
to be president

30:04.630 --> 30:06.200
and asking her
to run away with him

30:06.200 --> 30:09.030
to the Maldives or somewhere.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
Tariq is using this to undermine

30:11.040 --> 30:15.040
Jamal's authority
with his Elite Guard.

30:19.950 --> 30:23.610
(sighs) Jamal
came to me that day.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.180
He asked <i> me</i> to go with him.

30:27.620 --> 30:30.120
But I laughed it off.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.620
Like some annoyance.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.690
Like I do.

30:41.630 --> 30:45.300
"Be a man," I said.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.370
(panting)

30:51.640 --> 30:54.150
We have to protect him, Bassam.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.700
You and I...
We have to protect him

30:56.700 --> 31:00.000
from his enemies
and from himself.

31:01.940 --> 31:04.000
Yeah.

31:06.340 --> 31:08.580
(crying) I can't breathe.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.640
(sobbing)

31:11.780 --> 31:13.150
(Barry) I'm sorry.

31:13.150 --> 31:17.150
(crying and sobbing)

31:24.690 --> 31:27.530
So, how did
we lose Jenna?

31:27.530 --> 31:29.970
(Emma) Late night
last night, I think.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.370
She's
sleeping off the effects.

31:31.370 --> 31:32.650
(Sammy) Well, she's gonna miss

31:32.650 --> 31:33.980
the beach if she's not careful.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.140
I'm gonna put my suit on.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.710
Listen, I was thinking,
uh, instead of the beach

31:38.710 --> 31:41.510
maybe I could steal you
guys for the afternoon and

31:41.510 --> 31:43.040
take you somewhere special.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.090
Better than the beach?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.710
A Bedouin village
about an hour from here.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.280
(Sammy) Okay, so not
better than the beach.

31:49.290 --> 31:52.050
It's where your
grandfather was born,

31:52.050 --> 31:54.050
where you guys are from.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.220
(Sammy) Okay.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.060
Yeah, sure.

31:57.060 --> 31:58.390
Yeah, I'm in.

31:58.390 --> 31:59.690
Mom, you, too?

32:00.200 --> 32:02.730
Uh, I have an
appointment at the embassy

32:02.730 --> 32:05.500
today, so... It's okay.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.900
Have a good day with your dad.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.070
Okay.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.710
I'll see you guys in
the garage in ten minutes.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.880
(sighs)

32:21.050 --> 32:23.020
You okay with this?

32:23.020 --> 32:25.020
You should have told me.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.420
It's just one more secret.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.760
(scoffs) Molly,
it's not a secret.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.060
It just... It occurred
to me this morning.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.130
I thought it was a good idea.

32:32.130 --> 32:33.390
That what?

32:33.390 --> 32:35.410
All of a sudden, our
children are Al Fayeeds?

32:35.410 --> 32:36.520
They <i> are</i> Al Fayeeds.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.780
You've denied
that their whole lives.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.950
Even when they came here,

32:39.950 --> 32:42.290
you brought them as guests,
and now they're natives?

32:42.290 --> 32:46.290
Look, if I can't tell
them what I'm doing, then this

32:46.290 --> 32:48.830
is my best defense... to show
them their country,

32:48.830 --> 32:50.200
what I'm fighting for.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.860
Molly, I don't want my kids to
hate me for what I'm doing.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.280
I want them to be proud of me.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.100
I want them to understand.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.690
(door opens)
(John) Sorry for making you wait.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.230
We have been on a conference
call with the secretary.

33:25.230 --> 33:27.700
That's a man who likes the
sound of his own voice.

33:27.700 --> 33:31.600
Your wife Dana...
She's still at Betty Ford?

33:35.540 --> 33:38.540
Day 37, yes.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.380
I'm guessing she's not
the first State Department

33:41.380 --> 33:43.120
spouse to wind up in rehab.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.950
Occupational hazard.

33:44.950 --> 33:49.720
Leaving home for years at time,
living from post to post.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.290
There's a price.

33:52.290 --> 33:56.560
And now it's my
family's turn to pay.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.060
I should have
introduced you.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.730
This is Lea Exley.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.750
Hi. Nice to meet you.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.170
I'll be handling your security
once you're stateside.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.530
How could you think
this was a good idea?

34:05.530 --> 34:07.670
My husband is a pediatrician.

34:08.070 --> 34:09.440
Your husband came to us.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.420
We didn't go to him.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.790
We tried to talk him out of it.

34:11.790 --> 34:14.489
Not hard enough.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.760
You could have said no.

34:16.770 --> 34:19.199
That might have stopped him.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.500
Mrs. Al Fayeed, I appreciate that
all of this is a little disorienting.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.210
You have a real
gift for understatement.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.800
This isn't disorienting.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.679
This is... (laughs)

34:32.780 --> 34:34.850
I'm sorry.

34:40.860 --> 34:44.219
I, uh, think we should
review protocols sooner

34:44.219 --> 34:46.360
rather than later.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.159
Our people will meet you at LAX

34:48.159 --> 34:50.600
and take you through passport
control, and then they'll

34:50.600 --> 34:51.980
transport you to a safe house

34:51.980 --> 34:55.020
- where we'll have security...
- Wait a minute. What safe house?

34:55.020 --> 34:56.370
It's just outside
Ashland, Oregon.

34:56.370 --> 34:57.530
I've never been there myself,

34:57.530 --> 34:59.440
but I understand it's quite
nice this time of year.

34:59.440 --> 35:03.980
We already have a home.

35:03.980 --> 35:07.620
Whether your husband
succeeds or fails,

35:07.620 --> 35:10.650
you'll be exposed
to potential reprisals.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.750
Whatever the outcome,
this is your new normal.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.590
And I think the sooner you
accept that,

35:16.590 --> 35:18.660
the better off you'll be.

35:26.170 --> 35:30.340
Tell the tower
to authorize takeoff.

35:36.110 --> 35:38.180
Proceed with takeoff.

35:41.820 --> 35:44.920
Mr. President, what
could possibly be so important

35:44.920 --> 35:46.320
you felt it necessary to pull me

35:46.320 --> 35:48.660
off the plane to Wadi Ganoub?

35:48.660 --> 35:50.890
Whatever it is, can't it hold?

35:50.890 --> 35:52.090
My men are waiting.

35:52.490 --> 35:56.460
I promise you, you will
get where you need to go.

35:56.470 --> 35:58.630
(over P.A.) Military
transport is wheels up.

35:58.630 --> 35:59.870
En route to Wadi Ganoub.

35:59.870 --> 36:02.300
Jamal, what are you doing?
(helicopter whirring in distance)

36:02.300 --> 36:04.410
I'm supposed to be on that plane.
(helicopter whirring in distance)

36:04.410 --> 36:07.740
I've had it explained
to me a hundred times,

36:07.740 --> 36:14.950
but I still don't understand how
something so big, so heavy...

36:14.950 --> 36:19.190
can soar through the
sky with such ease.

36:23.930 --> 36:27.600
Man... playing God.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.660
Wanting to fly with the birds.

36:31.660 --> 36:35.660
(explosion)

36:38.310 --> 36:39.710
(gun cocks)

36:39.710 --> 36:41.710
General Tariq,

36:41.710 --> 36:44.780
you are hereby
under arrest for treason.

36:44.780 --> 36:46.180
(soldier) Come on!

36:46.180 --> 36:48.180
(Tariq) Jamal, what
is this about?

36:48.180 --> 36:49.980
- (Tariq) I've done nothing.
- (soldier) Let's go!

36:49.980 --> 36:50.980
I'm being set up.

36:50.990 --> 36:51.690
This is insane.

36:51.690 --> 36:52.690
Do not believe them.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.430
They're playing with you.

36:54.430 --> 36:55.390
Don't be fooled.

36:55.390 --> 36:56.510
Your brother is the traitor.

36:56.510 --> 36:59.290
Jamal, I urge you.
(yelling) Jamal!

37:07.670 --> 37:10.010
First cup
goes to the host.

37:10.010 --> 37:15.010
(chatting and laughing in distance)

37:17.550 --> 37:19.950
<i>Shukran.</i>

37:19.950 --> 37:21.280
(Sammy and Emma)<i> Shukran.</i>

37:21.280 --> 37:23.280
(Barry clears throat)

37:24.420 --> 37:27.090
So you and Jamal used
to come out here?

37:27.090 --> 37:28.330
Yeah, with my father.

37:28.650 --> 37:31.560
We'd drink tea, listen to the

37:31.560 --> 37:34.060
Bedouin tell their
stories into the night.

37:34.060 --> 37:37.000
My father knew all
of their names.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.570
He knew
how many kids they had.

37:38.570 --> 37:42.570
He knew if it had been a
good season, everything.

37:42.570 --> 37:47.740
But the thing that I remember
most was him laughing.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.980
Always laughing.

37:49.980 --> 37:53.080
It was not something that we

37:53.080 --> 37:56.480
heard very often, but here...

37:58.360 --> 38:01.320
People here laugh a lot.

38:04.390 --> 38:06.060
Once or twice a year, the rains

38:06.060 --> 38:07.660
come and flood
the bottom of the wash,

38:07.660 --> 38:08.960
and everyone rushes down there

38:08.960 --> 38:11.770
and they collect as much
of it as they can before it disappears.

38:12.530 --> 38:13.700
I mean, imagine that.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.950
Imagine living without any
constant source of water.

38:16.950 --> 38:19.060
That's the amazing thing
about the Bedouin.

38:19.060 --> 38:23.560
Even in the desert, they
choose land over water.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.800
(sighs)

38:25.800 --> 38:29.570
And my father would look out
over this view and say to me,

38:29.570 --> 38:32.140
"Never forget, Bassam.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.710
This is where you come from."

38:47.720 --> 38:53.260
I'm really sorry that I kept
all of this from you guys.

38:53.260 --> 38:57.560
So why are
you telling us now?

38:57.560 --> 39:01.900
It just hit me that
you're the same age that I was

39:01.900 --> 39:05.910
when I left, and I guess I
wanted you to understand before

39:05.910 --> 39:10.440
you left that... you guys
are not visitors here.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.440
You're not tourists.

39:13.450 --> 39:16.510
This is where you're from.

39:25.510 --> 39:28.510
(engine roaring)

39:28.510 --> 39:31.510
(oriental music playing)

39:37.470 --> 39:39.940
Oh, my God. Dad?
(music stops)

39:39.940 --> 39:41.140
What?

39:41.140 --> 39:43.940
A plane full of Abbudin
Elite Guard officers just

39:43.940 --> 39:47.440
crashed after takeoff.

39:47.450 --> 39:50.510
There are no survivors.

39:56.390 --> 40:00.890
My fellow countrymen,
it is with great sorrow that I

40:00.890 --> 40:03.460
confirm reports of a plane crash

40:03.460 --> 40:06.960
resulting in the loss of over
two dozen of Abbudin's Elite

40:06.970 --> 40:08.870
Guard.

40:08.870 --> 40:12.900
This is truly a
national tragedy.

40:12.910 --> 40:17.540
Investigators are on the
scene, probing the cause.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.240
Our thoughts and prayers go out

40:20.250 --> 40:23.580
to the families and loved
ones of the brave victims.

40:23.580 --> 40:27.580
- (quietly) What the hell happened?
- (Jamal) While still pursuing...

40:27.590 --> 40:31.490
(quietly) Ziad was acting
on orders from your brother.

40:31.490 --> 40:32.820
That wasn't the plan.

40:32.830 --> 40:38.890
Well, apparently Leila
whispered into Jamal's ear

40:38.890 --> 40:42.430
that a roundup was... insufficient.

40:42.430 --> 40:44.940
Ziad couldn't disobey
Jamal's order.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.700
It was the only play.

40:46.710 --> 40:50.710
But should signs
ultimately point to this having

40:50.710 --> 40:55.950
- been an act of terror...
- Mass murder is not

40:55.950 --> 40:57.050
what I signed up for.

40:57.050 --> 41:00.550
It's not surgery,
Barry, it's a coup.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.550
Shit happens.

41:02.550 --> 41:08.390
(Jamal) You cannot terrorize
the people of this great country.

41:08.390 --> 41:11.560
I will not allow this or
any future violence

41:11.560 --> 41:14.730
to disrupt
our nation's historic march

41:14.730 --> 41:17.200
toward democratic reform.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.600
(man) And we're off air.
Thank you, Mr. President.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.640
Excellent speech.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.320
Thank you, my love.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.230
- Everyone, I need the room.
- (cameraman) Of course.

41:43.230 --> 41:46.300
Come, everyone.
(chatting, footsteps departing)

41:49.270 --> 41:52.970
(quietly) Thank you,
Bassam, as always.

42:00.410 --> 42:04.580
This is not
what we discussed.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.180
This way is better.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.190
A lesson to those who
would question my rule.

42:09.190 --> 42:12.920
By killing dozens
of men and your own uncle?

42:17.030 --> 42:19.100
Come with me.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.720
See, Bassam?

42:40.720 --> 42:43.220
I don't murder family.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.560
No matter how treacherous.

42:45.560 --> 42:49.130
How traitorous.

42:49.130 --> 42:51.730
So tell me, Uncle, how does it

42:51.730 --> 42:55.570
feel being inside the cage
where you kept so many?

42:55.570 --> 42:58.740
This is madness.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.870
You know what is madness?

43:01.870 --> 43:05.740
Spreading rumors about
me to your men.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.210
I didn't.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.480
No?

43:09.480 --> 43:13.420
Like the tribal leaders you
didn't invite to your

43:13.420 --> 43:16.920
military exercises behind my back.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.260
It was for you.

43:19.260 --> 43:20.920
Me?

43:20.930 --> 43:22.890
Yes.

43:22.890 --> 43:25.630
To buy their support for you.

43:27.570 --> 43:31.270
To guarantee the outcome of this

43:31.270 --> 43:36.870
absurd election your brother
has poisoned your mind with.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.780
Don't you see what he's doing?

43:38.780 --> 43:40.540
Are you so blind?

43:40.550 --> 43:45.220
Bassam's been wanting to get
rid of me since he got here.

43:45.220 --> 43:49.390
He's manipulating
you like a child.

43:49.390 --> 43:52.460
And now he's convinced
you I'm a traitor.

43:52.460 --> 43:55.890
When my only crime
is opposing him.

43:55.890 --> 44:02.800
Ask yourself, whose interest is
served by this false charge?

44:02.800 --> 44:06.200
Who is the real traitor?

44:35.070 --> 44:38.970
Are these the
hands of a child?

44:46.110 --> 44:49.180
The fists of a child?

44:52.250 --> 44:54.320
(Tariq shouts)

45:07.800 --> 45:09.870
(Tariq coughs)

45:20.280 --> 45:25.280
Slander my brother
again, and it will be your

45:25.280 --> 45:27.820
last utterance.

45:27.820 --> 45:31.390
Family or no.

45:53.650 --> 45:56.250
Well played.

45:56.250 --> 45:58.480
Though I'm not surprised.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.920
You were a killer when

45:59.920 --> 46:04.650
you were nine years old,
and you still are.

46:11.500 --> 46:14.600
You betrayed my father.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.230
And I'll see you stand trial

46:16.230 --> 46:21.670
as a war criminal if it's
the last thing I do.

46:29.050 --> 46:32.780
I know your soul, Bassam.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.620
Killer!

46:35.620 --> 46:38.690
I know who you are!

46:40.960 --> 46:43.030
(footsteps approaching)

46:50.570 --> 46:54.470
Molly, I had nothing
to do with the plane.

47:00.210 --> 47:03.280
Honey, you have to believe me.

47:05.380 --> 47:09.590
I believe you
didn't pull the trigger.

47:09.590 --> 47:11.890
But don't lie to yourself.

47:11.890 --> 47:14.890
You're the one who started this.

47:14.890 --> 47:18.260
Do you know we have to
live in a safe house now?

47:18.260 --> 47:21.560
In our own country.

47:21.570 --> 47:24.800
Your children are gonna live
in fear for the rest of their lives.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.600
Are you okay with that?

47:25.600 --> 47:28.610
In a week, two weeks,
you're gonna be back here.

47:28.610 --> 47:30.240
Here.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.740
Where, after tomorrow, we'll
be in even more danger.

47:32.740 --> 47:35.410
Where Jamal, Leila, Ahmed,

47:35.410 --> 47:37.910
half the country is gonna
want you dead.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.080
You're gonna get killed.

47:39.080 --> 47:41.250
(panting)

47:41.250 --> 47:43.350
That is not gonna happen.

47:43.350 --> 47:46.460
(screaming) You don't know that!

47:50.860 --> 47:59.600
Barry... honey...
listen to me, okay?

47:59.600 --> 48:02.840
For the sake of our family, us,

48:02.840 --> 48:07.940
the four of us, the only family
you had two months ago,

48:07.940 --> 48:11.450
I'm asking you
to come home with us.

48:11.450 --> 48:18.020
I'm begging you to
come home with us.

48:18.020 --> 48:24.360
Just let whatever happens here
happen without you, okay?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.260
Please, Barry. Come on.

48:26.260 --> 48:27.530
Just come home with us.

48:27.530 --> 48:29.170
(kissing)

48:29.170 --> 48:30.930
Come home with us, please.

48:30.940 --> 48:32.940
(sighs)

48:32.940 --> 48:35.000
(whimpers)

49:00.630 --> 49:05.630
Don't expect us to come back.
