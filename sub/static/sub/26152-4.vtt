-(applause) -Billy!

00:08.010 --> 00:10.040
-...is miserable. He has been ever since Lotti dumped him.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.120
-I've got an event on Saturday night.

00:13.130 --> 00:15.210
Do you want your boy to fight on a real card?

00:15.220 --> 00:17.110
-I think I've lost your father.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.070
-Here I am, Lil.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.130
A reformed character, as directed.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.140
(laughing)

00:23.160 --> 00:25.070
-Who are you, then? -I'm the driver.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.170
-(gunfire)

00:28.120 --> 00:29.190
-You work for the mayor.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.200
-The mayor and I have an arrangement.

00:31.210 --> 00:34.110
-Albert:  Yeah, well, he's just offered   us an arrangement, too.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.160
-(engine whirring)

00:43.170 --> 00:45.060
-(laughter)

00:45.070 --> 00:48.090
-Oh! -We're nearly in Spain.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.000
I mean, I can't believe we pulled it off.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.100
10 million Euros.

00:53.110 --> 00:55.070
-Well, we're not there yet.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.230
-I think I'm gonna open my own business.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.030
Put my share of the money to good work.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.050
What about you, Billy?

01:02.060 --> 01:03.090
-Me?

01:03.110 --> 01:04.110
-What are you gonna do?

01:04.110 --> 01:06.100
-I haven't really had time to think about it.

01:06.110 --> 01:09.060
A few weeks ago, I was living in a gym.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.070
-Well, maybe you should think about it a bit.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.130
I mean, we all have to plan for our futures, right?

01:15.140 --> 01:17.190
-Yeah, well,

01:17.200 --> 01:19.190
when I get to Spain I'll see what's what.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.100
-It's gonna be so nice not having to rely on anyone.

01:24.130 --> 01:26.090
I mean, for the first time in my life,

01:26.100 --> 01:28.060
I can be independent.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.190
I can stand on my own two feet.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.080
-Well, uh...

01:35.150 --> 01:38.000
how independent do you wanna be?

01:38.010 --> 01:40.160
-Well, completely. What do you mean?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.190
Oh.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.060
Billy, I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:47.070 --> 01:48.070
-It's cool.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.150
We don't need to make promises to each other we're not gonna keep.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.030
I'm easy.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.190
-Billy, listen--

02:11.140 --> 02:13.230
-Man:  Do we have the stones,   the diamonds?

02:14.230 --> 02:16.220
Where are you taking   the diamonds?

02:18.100 --> 02:19.100

02:57.100 --> 02:58.140
I'm here to get your body

02:58.150 --> 03:00.070
and your nut straight for the fight.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.140
Pop, pop.

03:01.150 --> 03:02.210
Come on.

03:04.090 --> 03:06.050
-You're here to get my nut straight?

03:06.060 --> 03:09.030
-Well, it takes a nutter to know a nutter.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.090
-I'm sweet, mate.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.130
Don't worry about me.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.080
-Yeah, yeah, of course you are.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.230
Come on, let's fucking go.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.190
On your toes. Come on, let's go. Oh!

03:18.200 --> 03:20.160
Get up on your toes. Come on, son.

03:26.230 --> 03:29.070
-Charlie: Bunker Bar's back open for business.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.160
Won't be long before Mayor Ortega drops in to rattle our cage.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.210
-We've got to get ahead of him, though.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.030
No good sitting around here

03:36.040 --> 03:37.230
like a pair of lap dogs waiting for a pet.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.170
-He's written all the rules himself

03:39.180 --> 03:42.050
He's got the mayor's office, cops.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.150
San Toledo is set up like his own private kingdom.

03:49.030 --> 03:51.090
-We take Ortega's offer.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.030
Stay in town,

03:53.040 --> 03:55.080
act like we're gonna play nice.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.140
-Once inside his operation,

03:56.150 --> 03:58.070
we find just the right place to apply pressure.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.040
-Gotta be so careful, though, mate.

04:00.050 --> 04:01.190
-Where do we start?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.190
-By getting the mayor's attention.

-I'm not, I'm not, I'm just keeping him loose.

06:07.230 --> 06:08.230
He's all uptight.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.200
I can see it around his atmosphere.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.160
Body and soul, body and soul, like water.

06:12.170 --> 06:15.120
-Become like water, water. -Water?

06:15.130 --> 06:17.060
-Hate 'Em: Come on!

06:17.070 --> 06:18.170
-As a manager of a pro fighter,

06:18.180 --> 06:20.130
is this really the best trainer you could get?

06:20.140 --> 06:23.030
-Well, in a word, yes.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.210
-Oi, oi.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.160
I'm not a trainer.

06:26.170 --> 06:28.150
I'm a motivational coach.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.170
-Right, and in your professional opinion,

06:34.180 --> 06:35.230
how's he looking?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.220
-Great hands, but he's fucked in the head, isn't he?

06:38.230 --> 06:40.130
-I told ya!

06:40.140 --> 06:42.080
My head's straight!

06:43.100 --> 06:45.090
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course it is.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.210
You keep telling yourself that, kid.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.220
Keep at it. On your toes.

That's it, that's it, underneath, underneath.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.230
-I'm having a coffee with Lotti.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.200
-And doing a little bit of light reading, I see.

07:04.210 --> 07:07.120
-Well, someone's got to keep an eye on the books.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.090
This place isn't gonna run itself.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.040
-Weren't planning on making that a part of your day, were you, Albert?

07:16.090 --> 07:17.150
-So, how's it looking?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.210
-Uh, the same as it was last week.

07:20.070 --> 07:23.030
-We need money just to keep the doors open, Albert.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.200
-We don't need to worry about it, do we?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.090
-Let me help you

07:29.100 --> 07:32.010
-Mum, you spent 20 years running a flower shop

07:32.020 --> 07:33.040
to keep a roof over our heads.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.110
It's my problem. I'm gonna sort it.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.060
-(clears throat) Our problem.

07:37.070 --> 07:39.030
-All right, our problem, but it's not my mum's, is it?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.080
-I've nothing to do here. I'm bored.

07:41.090 --> 07:43.060
-So take a Spanish class or a cooking lesson.

07:43.070 --> 07:46.010
-(laughing)

07:46.020 --> 07:48.010
-Just learn to relax a bit.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.110
The sun's out.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.150
It's covered, all right?

07:57.160 --> 07:58.160
It's covered.

08:01.090 --> 08:03.000
-Cooking class?

08:03.010 --> 08:04.050
Spanish lessons?

08:04.060 --> 08:05.080
-Hmm.

08:05.090 --> 08:06.120
-(TV clicks on)

08:11.000 --> 08:13.060

08:13.070 --> 08:15.130
You're up to no good.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.220
-As necessity demands, Lotti.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.030
-Well, I want in. -You want in to what?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.110
-Nothing you need to worry about

08:22.130 --> 08:24.080
until after the fight, all right?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.150
-Right.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.100
After the fight.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.120
-Listen, we gotta keep his head clear.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.000
-Why are you looking at me?

08:34.010 --> 08:36.230
Can't just crawl into a hole and disappear, can I?

08:36.230 --> 08:38.120
-(reporter continues in Spanish)

08:41.140 --> 08:43.210
-(speaking Spanish)

09:01.100 --> 09:02.170
-Time to go to work, mate.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.120
-Albert:  Hola.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.070
I'm here to see Mayor Ortega.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.050
-You cannot see the mayor without an appointment.

09:13.060 --> 09:15.120
-Well, he'll want to see me.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.150
Tell him Albert Dimes is here

09:17.160 --> 09:19.220
and I have a gift for him.

09:19.230 --> 09:22.050
-Again, without an appointment,

09:22.060 --> 09:23.120
it is impossible.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.170
Good day,  señor.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.170
-Mr. Dimes, how can we help you?

09:28.180 --> 09:30.080
-Mayor Ortega,

09:30.090 --> 09:32.220
an unexpected opportunity has presented itself to me.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.180
I felt sure you'd be interested.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.050
-Please come into my office.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.060
-Assistant: Hmm.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.190
-(door opens)

09:50.220 --> 09:52.060
-(Albert grunts)

09:53.060 --> 09:54.110
(groans)

09:58.130 --> 10:02.010
-A known fugitive showing up on the mayor's doorstep.

10:03.230 --> 10:06.210
Thought you'd be smarter now not to try to embarrass me.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.160
-I wasn't trying to embarrass you.

10:09.170 --> 10:12.130
(breathing heavily)

10:12.140 --> 10:14.190
I was trying to enhance your reputation.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.080
(chuckles)

10:19.190 --> 10:21.230
-Explain that magic trick.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.190
-Pick a card.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.190
-Ortega: What is this?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.110
-This is two dead armed robbers

10:41.120 --> 10:43.110
and the missing cash from the gas station robbery.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.210
Case closed.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.230
And another PR win for Mayor Ortega.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.190
-What promoted such benevolence?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.190
-We decided to stay in San Toledo

10:51.200 --> 10:53.200
and I'm not gonna be satisfied just fronting a bar.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.210
You're the main game in town.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.120
I figured I gotta be useful to ya.

10:56.130 --> 10:58.150
-Useful, you are.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.190
-You're welcome.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.110
-So what now?

11:24.120 --> 11:26.060
-We follow the dead bodies, Lotti.

11:26.070 --> 11:28.040
They're bound to end up somewhere interesting.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.090
-Close your eyes.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.220
-Do what?

12:26.230 --> 12:28.100
-Close your eyes.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.120
Come on.

12:31.060 --> 12:34.140
Now, your feet are good,

12:34.150 --> 12:37.160
but your head's a bit upside down.

12:37.170 --> 12:40.080
Now I need you to repeat after me:

12:40.090 --> 12:43.230
"I am going to forget about this good-looking bird

12:44.000 --> 12:46.170
"and focus on the fight,

12:46.180 --> 12:49.000
and it might just change my life."

12:49.010 --> 12:51.050
-Are you taking the piss? -I'm not taking the piss, mate.

12:51.060 --> 12:53.050
-Oh, you seriously think this Lotti's a problem for me?

12:53.060 --> 12:55.010
We're good, I told ya, I told ya.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.020
-You could have fooled me, Billy Boy.

12:57.030 --> 12:58.160
Cause you're a tad raw about her, ain't ya?

13:00.090 --> 13:01.090
-Piss off!

13:02.130 --> 13:05.030
-(mid-tempo music plays)

13:05.040 --> 13:06.150
-(chuckles)

13:07.190 --> 13:09.060
-♪ If looks could kill ♪

13:09.070 --> 13:14.090
♪ That woman fits the bill ♪

13:16.040 --> 13:19.110
♪ With sexy legs   and doe eyes ♪

13:19.120 --> 13:21.060
-Ta da!

13:21.070 --> 13:22.070
-What's all this, then?

13:22.080 --> 13:26.060
-It's just a little something I've, uh, thrown together.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.070
-It's veal scaloppini.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.210
-Indeed it is.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.190
-That was the first meal you ever cooked for me.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.150
-And I love you as much today

13:38.160 --> 13:40.180
as I did all those years ago.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.120
-Three decades later and you still haven't got a clue how to show it, have you?

13:43.130 --> 13:44.130
-Hold on, how's that, then?

13:44.140 --> 13:46.130
-I don't need you to remind me of the good ol' days, Vic.

13:46.140 --> 13:51.020
I-- I just need you here with me, in the present.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.090
-What on Earth are you talking about?

13:52.100 --> 13:54.180
I am here with you. I'm standing right in front of you.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.150
-Are you?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.160
-I think your time in Blanco's cell has got in your head.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.050
You haven't been the same since you got out.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.180
-No, no, this goes back way before Blanco.

14:02.190 --> 14:04.020
We can't blame him for our problems.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.130
-What problems?

14:05.140 --> 14:07.040
We're in the Costa Del Sol,

14:07.050 --> 14:08.210
toasting my early retirement.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.210
The only problem I can see is the veal getting cold.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.220
-Your retirement, is it?

14:11.230 --> 14:13.130
Is that how you would describe your... (scoffs)

14:13.140 --> 14:16.030
activities here in San Toledo, Victor?

14:16.040 --> 14:20.060
-Well... yeah, actually.

14:20.070 --> 14:22.180
With a very occasional exception.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.230
Come on, Lily.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.120
You knew who I was when you married me.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.180
I'm a work-in-progress.

14:30.190 --> 14:33.190
-I know damn well who you are, Victor.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.050
That's not what I'm saying.

14:35.060 --> 14:37.100
-Well, then what the bloody hell are you saying?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.030
-(rock music)

15:07.110 --> 15:08.130
-Let's just drop it, all right?

15:08.140 --> 15:11.100
-No! No, I will not bloody well drop it!

15:11.110 --> 15:12.110
-Well, fine!

15:12.120 --> 15:13.230
Whose fault was it that I was held prisoner

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
by psycho cops in the first place, Vic?

15:17.180 --> 15:18.180
-It was mine.

15:18.190 --> 15:19.210
Is that what you want me to say?

15:19.220 --> 15:22.120
-No, I want to know why I'm not enough for you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.140
-"Enough for you?"

15:25.150 --> 15:28.040
Have I ever stepped out on you, ever?

15:28.050 --> 15:29.080
-That is not what I'm saying.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.090
-You're not making any sense, Lily! Where you going?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.160
-Well, not to a friggin' Spanish class!

15:33.170 --> 15:34.210
-"Spanish class?"

15:48.220 --> 15:51.090
This is all down to you.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.150
-(rock music)

16:05.090 --> 16:06.210
-That's him.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.030
Go.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.080
-Albert: How'd you get on?

16:24.090 --> 16:27.190
-We, uh, followed Tomas around with the bodies in the trunk.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.110
-And what'd he do?

16:29.120 --> 16:30.170
-Nothing yet.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.190
Come to think of it,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.080
must be getting quite ripe in this heat.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.170
-But he did stop off at half a dozen spots

16:36.180 --> 16:38.210
and picked up envelopes of cash.

16:38.220 --> 16:41.040
-Yeah, he's collecting for Ortega.

16:41.050 --> 16:42.180
-I see, and how is business for the mayor?

16:42.190 --> 16:44.170
-Booming. -Albert: So where's Tomas now?

16:44.180 --> 16:47.080
-Well, he's still at the police station.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.010
Been there for a while.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.080
We put Fanta Limon on stakeout.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.020
He's gonna flag us when he's on the move.

16:54.230 --> 16:57.090
-You put Fanta Limon on a stakeout?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.130
-Lotti: Yeah!

16:58.140 --> 16:59.180
He's a natural.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.020
-Woman (on radio):  Jointing a rabbit is easy.

17:03.030 --> 17:05.140
At the head end,   you will see the shoulders,

17:05.150 --> 17:08.050
the legs,   and in between the neck

17:08.060 --> 17:10.090
and the ribs   and the saddle.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.140
-In between the saddle.

17:12.150 --> 17:15.140
-Keep your rabbit   well-basted with sauce

17:15.150 --> 17:18.190
using a small brush   or a ladle.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.220
Keeping the rabbit moist   is of the utmost importance.

17:25.090 --> 17:26.130
-Albert: What are you doing here?

17:26.140 --> 17:28.140
-I was driving by.

17:28.150 --> 17:31.070
Thought I would stop in and say,  "hola."

17:31.080 --> 17:33.090
Hola.  Now what are you really doing here?

17:33.100 --> 17:34.130
-A whiskey.

17:43.170 --> 17:45.030
You framed those thugs for a crime

17:45.040 --> 17:46.070
they couldn't have committed

17:46.080 --> 17:48.040
because they are dead.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.100
I should know, because I shot them.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.200
-Has the mayor got you on speed dial?

17:50.210 --> 17:53.020
-San Toledo's a small town,

17:53.030 --> 17:54.190
and I don't want to be standing too close

17:54.200 --> 17:56.060
when this all blows up in your hands.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.090
-Well, Ortega gave us a choice.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.010
We decided to stay.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.000
Playing fair with him is the best move I got.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.050
The gas station move was reckless,

18:04.060 --> 18:06.000
but it worked.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.010
Ortega wants you sitting at his table at the fight.

18:12.030 --> 18:13.080
See you later.

18:13.090 --> 18:15.170
-Wait, you're forgetting something.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.120
-It's a tuxedo for tonight.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.120
A gift for you from the mayor.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.000
Wear it.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.110
-And how did he know my size?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.080
-He didn't.

18:32.210 --> 18:35.020
-There you are, Charlie boy.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.160
-Well, hello, Vic.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.200
How are you?

18:38.210 --> 18:40.130
-A bit of a busy day, was it?

18:40.140 --> 18:41.150
-Well...

18:41.160 --> 18:44.030
actually, yeah, it was quite--

18:44.040 --> 18:45.230
quite busy.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.120
And, uh, yourself?

18:50.020 --> 18:53.000
-You can't all run around for Ortega.

18:53.010 --> 18:55.110
He's way out of your league, son.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.150
It will end with a bang.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.060
-(iron hisses)

18:59.070 --> 19:01.000
-(scoffs) No.

19:01.010 --> 19:05.000
I wouldn't exactly say we're running around for him...

19:05.000 --> 19:06.060
exactly.

19:06.070 --> 19:07.140
-Well, what would you say?

19:07.150 --> 19:09.000
Exactly?

19:10.050 --> 19:12.220
-Do you think that this might be a conversation you should have with Albert?

19:12.230 --> 19:15.090
-Nah, my son won't listen to me.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.100
I say go left, he turns right.

19:17.110 --> 19:19.200
He's stubborn just like his father.

19:19.210 --> 19:22.050
That's why I'm talking to you.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.120
-And, uh, what do you suggest?

19:28.210 --> 19:30.220
-Well, my approach would be

19:30.230 --> 19:32.210
a little more direct, if you know what I mean.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.110
-Oh, but you can't go after the mayor, Vic, okay?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.170
He's an elected government official, for God's sake.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.220
We'll have every policeman in Spain looking for us.

19:39.230 --> 19:41.190
It's not good for our current situation.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.030
-It's better than being brown bread

19:43.040 --> 19:45.050
in the boot of a Bentley, Charlie.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.100
What happened to Albert's plan of going straight, hmm?

19:50.070 --> 19:51.150
-Look, we're gonna be the mayor's dogs

19:51.160 --> 19:53.050
for as long as he's got us on his leash.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.090
So we make him the mark.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.160
If we can play this right,

19:57.170 --> 19:59.130
we'll get a second chance at the good life.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.030
-What if you get it wrong?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.180
-(tense music)

20:11.200 --> 20:13.110
-That's it, Billy boy. Light on your feet.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.140
Find the sweet spot, that's it.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.000
Start eyeing the line, come on!

20:16.010 --> 20:17.070
Get your rhythm going.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.150
Focus, come on. Hit the sweet spot.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.110
That's good! Jab and move.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.130
-How's he looking?

20:22.140 --> 20:23.160
-Yeah, good.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.060
We had any dough, I'd put in on him.

20:25.070 --> 20:27.030
-More important matters at hand, mate.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.090
-Like what, our friend the mayor?

20:29.100 --> 20:31.110
-And what are we gonna do about him.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.060
Leave it up to the kids to handle?

20:33.070 --> 20:34.090
-Well, it looks like you're not.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.100
-Every breath he takes is an insult

20:36.110 --> 20:37.220
after what he did to my Lily.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.060
-Look.

20:41.070 --> 20:44.060
Why don't you go get yourself ready for the fight?

20:44.070 --> 20:46.020
We could all do with a night out, eh?

20:46.030 --> 20:48.130
-I'm not going.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.180
-What do you mean, you're not going?

20:54.090 --> 20:55.180
-You'll all be there.

20:55.190 --> 20:57.120
Billy will be well supported.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.150
-Oi.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.220
You ain't gonna do nothing stupid, are you, Vic?

21:04.070 --> 21:05.220
-Come on, Hate 'Em.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.090
You know me.

21:12.090 --> 21:13.170
-(mid-tempo music)

21:18.220 --> 21:24.050
-♪ Baby, hold   your head up high ♪

21:24.060 --> 21:28.150
♪ Baby, don't you cry ♪

21:29.200 --> 21:34.160
♪ Let the memories   of this moment go by ♪

21:34.170 --> 21:36.150
-(footsteps approaching)

21:36.160 --> 21:38.200
-Buenos dias,  Lily.

21:38.210 --> 21:39.230
How are you?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.170
-I'm good.

21:42.180 --> 21:44.120
Thanks, Clarence. How are you?

21:44.130 --> 21:47.000
-What could possibly be wrong?

21:47.010 --> 21:49.090
Don't have to be anywhere I don't wanna be

21:49.100 --> 21:52.030
or with anybody I don't wanna be with.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
-(Lily chuckles)

21:53.050 --> 21:54.190
Must be nice being you.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.190
-These days it is.

21:58.020 --> 22:01.120
Do you, uh, play poker by any chance?

22:03.190 --> 22:06.130
-Well, I've been known to play a few hands in my time.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.060
-May I?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.020
All right. (clears throat)

22:17.090 --> 22:19.020
-Don't say I didn't warn you.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.100
-(instrumental music)

22:24.180 --> 22:26.060
-Fancy suit.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.130
-Thanks. It was a gift.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.040
-A gift?

22:31.050 --> 22:33.010
From who? -The mayor.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.170
-Why did the mayor get you a suit?

22:34.180 --> 22:36.210
-He wants me sittin' at his table for the fight tonight.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.100
-So he, uh, he bought the gas station shenanigans, then.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.110
-Albert: He did.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.210
And the more he thinks I'm useful,

22:41.220 --> 22:43.140
even loyal, the closer I can get.

22:44.190 --> 22:47.150
-Turn often   while cooking for one hour

22:47.160 --> 22:52.010
or until your rabbit pieces   are nice and tender.  -(chuckles)

22:52.020 --> 22:54.040
Nice and tender rabbit.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.110
-The flesh will cascade   from the bones

22:56.120 --> 22:58.040
in gentle waves...

23:00.040 --> 23:01.080
-Puta!

23:01.090 --> 23:03.110
-(upbeat music)

23:28.100 --> 23:29.220
-(mellow music plays)

23:36.180 --> 23:38.020
-That's five hands in a row.

23:38.030 --> 23:40.010
-I did warn you.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.130
-And I bet no one ever catches

23:41.140 --> 23:43.150
that bottom-dealing move you pulled either.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.220
-Well, I was just making sure

23:47.230 --> 23:49.050
you were paying attention, Clarence.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.110
-Now you have your answer.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.130
-I better get going.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.060
I've gotta get ready for the fight tonight.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.190
-Hey, listen.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.120
I got a regular poker game in town tomorrow.

24:01.230 --> 24:04.190
The two of us could make some money.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.080
-So you're a grifter now, are you, Clarence?

24:07.090 --> 24:09.090
-Isn't there a bit of grifter in all of us?

24:14.210 --> 24:16.090
-(instrumental music)

24:19.130 --> 24:20.220
-Does it fit all right?

24:20.230 --> 24:22.230
-Perfectly.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.110
How does the mayor know your size?

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
-He didn't.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.100
-But she does.

24:27.110 --> 24:30.020
-Sorry, "she"?

24:30.030 --> 24:32.100
You mean-- you mean the driver who works for the mayor,

24:32.100 --> 24:33.150
who killed the Catalans stone dead,

24:33.160 --> 24:34.200
who we most definitely can't trust?

24:34.220 --> 24:36.020
-That's the one.

24:36.030 --> 24:37.180
-Is she gonna be a problem for you, Al?

24:37.190 --> 24:38.200
-Charlie, don't be silly.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.210
She's in with the mayor.

24:39.220 --> 24:41.090
She's an opportunity, nothing more.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.100
-(phone chimes)

24:43.140 --> 24:45.230
-It's Fanta. Tomas is on the move.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.210
-We'll see you at the fight. -See ya.

24:53.060 --> 24:55.170
-(knocking) -Albert: Billy Boy, you in there?

24:55.180 --> 24:57.050
-Yeah.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.130
(scoffs)

25:01.140 --> 25:03.000
Look at you.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.130
-How you feeling? You all right?

25:05.140 --> 25:06.220
It's a big night.

25:07.230 --> 25:09.220
-Yeah.

25:09.230 --> 25:11.090
Big night.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
-What's the matter?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.110
Come on. What's the matter?

25:20.030 --> 25:21.190
-I never really thought I'd get this shot

25:21.200 --> 25:23.070
at a pro fight, you know?

25:23.080 --> 25:24.110
-Mmm.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.040
And yet, here you are.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.140
-Yeah, and what happens if I'm full of shit, hmm?

25:31.200 --> 25:34.050
-Only one way to find out, innit?

25:35.230 --> 25:36.230
I'll tell you one thing.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.020
The answer ain't out there in that soppy sunset.

25:42.230 --> 25:44.100
That's for you, by the way.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.020
-(door closes)

25:52.150 --> 25:54.130
-(up-tempo music)

26:05.050 --> 26:06.190
-(chuckling)

26:13.080 --> 26:15.000
-(rock music)

26:24.160 --> 26:27.090

26:27.100 --> 26:29.230

26:30.000 --> 26:32.130

26:32.140 --> 26:35.030

26:35.040 --> 26:37.010
-(blows landing)

26:38.020 --> 26:39.130
-You look half decent.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.170
-And who knew all it would take was a good suit?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.050
-(bell dinging)

26:47.060 --> 26:49.050
-(applause) -Albert: Feels empty for a pro fight.

26:49.060 --> 26:52.030
-Ines: The mayor likes to keep things exclusive.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.090
-So where is he?

26:54.100 --> 26:55.100
-Follow me.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.010
-(blows landing)

27:07.040 --> 27:08.060
- Buenas noches , Albert.

27:08.070 --> 27:10.010
-Buenas noches,  Mayor Ortega.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.090
-Sit down and join us.

27:16.140 --> 27:18.150
I hear your friend is the replacement

27:18.160 --> 27:20.100
to fight San Toledo's own son, Rueben Cerro.

27:20.110 --> 27:21.230
-That's right.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.220
-Tell me, how do you rate his chances?

27:24.230 --> 27:27.050
-Well, I wouldn't bet against Billy,

27:27.060 --> 27:29.020
not unless I rigged the fight, of course.

27:29.030 --> 27:31.010
-(Ortega chuckles)

27:31.020 --> 27:32.120
Did you rig this fight?

27:32.130 --> 27:35.210
-San Toledo's not my town.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.010
I wouldn't dream of it.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.100
-(Ortega chuckles)

27:40.040 --> 27:41.160
-Nice and sharp, Billy.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.070
-How's our boy looking?

27:47.080 --> 27:49.070
-About as good as you do, Mrs. H.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.030
-We'll all be out there watching, all right?

27:51.040 --> 27:53.000
We're proud of you, yeah?

27:54.190 --> 27:56.060
Put him on his arse, Billy.

27:58.150 --> 27:59.180
-Alright. You heard her.

27:59.190 --> 28:02.080
Give me four. Good.

28:02.090 --> 28:05.030
-(guitar music plays)

28:16.050 --> 28:18.060
-Pour without fear,  señora.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.020
Gracias.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.000
-De nada, caballero.

28:24.010 --> 28:25.080
-(clapping rhythmically)

28:30.000 --> 28:31.050
-(blows landing)

28:31.060 --> 28:32.060
-(Ortega speaks Spanish)

28:35.020 --> 28:36.020
-Would I be safe in assuming

28:36.030 --> 28:38.040
you know a good bottle of whiskey when you see it?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.020
-I can pick out a blend from a single malt.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.140
-I trust your judgment.

28:42.150 --> 28:44.030
I'll take it neat.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.060
In fact, ask the rest of my guests

28:47.070 --> 28:49.080
what they would like to drink also.

28:56.050 --> 28:58.160
-(instrumental music)

28:58.170 --> 29:00.030
-(construction noises)

29:10.220 --> 29:12.230
-What's he doing, Fanta?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.190
-He's been waiting out on the pier here

29:15.200 --> 29:18.180
for about 20 minutes,  Señorita Lotti .

29:20.210 --> 29:22.090
-(Billy sighs)

29:29.090 --> 29:31.170
-(knocking)  -Cinco minutos,  Billy.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.050
Cerro is a top fighter.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.160
Just try and stay on your feet as long as you can, okay?

29:36.170 --> 29:38.180
-Don't you worry about a thing, mate.

29:38.190 --> 29:41.040
He won't be going down any time soon, okay?

29:41.050 --> 29:42.210
-Right.

29:42.220 --> 29:44.220
-Ponce.

29:44.230 --> 29:47.140
Don't listen to a word he says, son, all right?

29:47.150 --> 29:49.080
You just visualize that win, okay?

29:49.090 --> 29:51.030
Stay focused.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.120
Remember what we spoke about.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.010
Remember the training.

29:55.230 --> 29:57.140

-Excuse us, please.

30:50.210 --> 30:53.020
-(instrumental music)

31:14.080 --> 31:16.080
-Are those the keys from the truck I hijacked?

31:17.090 --> 31:19.050
-It's possible.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.190
-And who's that woman?

31:22.180 --> 31:24.090
-Always questions.

31:25.110 --> 31:27.090
-I like to know who I'm working with.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.100
-You mean "you're working for?"

31:31.110 --> 31:34.020
Don't get ahead of yourself, Alberto.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.100
-So who is she?

31:37.140 --> 31:39.050
-Ines: Sylvia Garcia.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.060
The biggest hash dealer on Costa Del Sol.

31:47.020 --> 31:49.090
-(engine rumbling) -(indistinct chatter)

31:54.100 --> 31:55.140
-Lotti: What is it?

31:57.110 --> 31:59.000
What do you see?

31:59.010 --> 32:00.220
-Charlie: There's our Catalan friends.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.010
-(instrumental music)

32:07.130 --> 32:10.050
-Lotti, that looks like the boat that hit us on the way to Spain.

32:14.070 --> 32:16.110
-Shit.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.090
I think you're right, Charlie.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.190
-And if it is...

32:21.200 --> 32:23.120
that means...

32:28.050 --> 32:31.000
-(inaudible)

32:36.210 --> 32:38.190
-So what do you think, Albert?

32:38.200 --> 32:40.170
What have you figured out?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.100
-Ortega stole the truck from Garcia

32:47.110 --> 32:49.010
just so he could   give it back to her.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.140
He's making a play for her to move her product through the airport.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.090
That's why he had us   frame Cortez,

32:53.100 --> 32:55.110
so he could have his own man   in charge of security.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.120
He's offering her a secure flight path in from Morocco

32:58.130 --> 33:00.050
to San Toledo.

33:02.190 --> 33:04.130
He's fucking smart.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.090
-(bell dings) -(cheers and applause)

35:12.180 --> 35:14.190
Sit, sit, sit, sit...

35:16.030 --> 35:17.030
Billy, look at me.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.230
-Ines: I hope your friend can put up more of a fight.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.150
Rueben Cerro has never been beaten.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.070
-First time for everything.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.110
the thugs Blanco sent you to hit

36:17.120 --> 36:18.210
stuck around to rob a gas station.

36:22.090 --> 36:24.110
Like your friend up there in the ring,

36:24.120 --> 36:25.120
you've got balls,

36:25.130 --> 36:27.000
and that's important,

-How's Cerro?

38:45.090 --> 38:47.220
-Not looking good, mate. It's touch and go.

39:03.170 --> 39:06.080
-Billy, you are not to blame.

39:06.090 --> 39:07.220
Okay?

39:09.110 --> 39:11.070
You need to know that.

-Did you see Billy's face in there?

40:18.160 --> 40:20.130
-I've never seen him look like that before.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.110
-Let's just pray Cerro pulls through.

40:24.070 --> 40:26.180
-(rock music)

40:55.100 --> 40:57.050
-Listen.

40:57.060 --> 40:58.230
Me and Lotti tailed Tomas to the docks.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.130
-Where he dumped the Catalans?

41:00.140 --> 41:02.150
-No, that's not the headline.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.210
-Go on.

41:04.220 --> 41:08.070
-The boat they're using to take the bodies out

41:08.080 --> 41:10.080
is the same one that rolled up on us six months ago.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.170
-What, the boat that hit us on the way into Spain?

41:13.180 --> 41:16.010
-Yeah. -It's the same one, Albert.

41:16.020 --> 41:19.090
If Blanco's men were the ones who took our money,

41:19.100 --> 41:21.220
then Mayor Ortega must have been behind it.

41:23.170 --> 41:25.130
-Of course, of course, it's all making sense.

41:25.140 --> 41:27.190
Of course, of course, that prick has our money.

41:29.230 --> 41:32.040
-Anyone seen Billy? He's gone.

41:32.050 --> 41:34.080
-What do you mean, he's gone? -Gone where?

41:34.090 --> 41:36.220
-He said he was going to the toilet. He must've slipped.

41:38.010 --> 41:40.010
-Ah, shit.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.040
