WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.630
Look at me, right?
And look at the Queen.

00:04.053 --> 00:07.073
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:07.082 --> 00:08.760
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.762 --> 00:11.560
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.562 --> 00:14.840
I know she's not a single parent
but she might as well be.

00:14.842 --> 00:17.600
Plus the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:17.602 --> 00:21.440
her literally sometimes,
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.442 --> 00:23.800
Admired and despised equally.

00:23.802 --> 00:26.360
Not for never lifting a finger, no.

00:26.362 --> 00:29.400
For setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.402 --> 00:31.920
And whether you're a bigwig
on her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.922 --> 00:34.560
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.562 --> 00:36.280
snip-snip-snipping
at your benefits.

00:36.282 --> 00:38.840
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:38.842 --> 00:41.040
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:41.042 --> 00:43.760
I got shot of my kids yonks back.

00:43.762 --> 00:46.880
Whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one. Fine!

00:46.882 --> 00:49.400
I've had to get out of bed
on occasion to make ends meet

00:49.402 --> 00:53.402
whereas she, she's done
the whole thing from a chair.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.040
And a drink for the lady.

00:56.042 --> 00:57.720
Oh, sure, there's perks.

00:57.722 --> 01:01.240
But, look at her lot. Brian May
prancing about on her roof.

01:01.242 --> 01:03.720
Now look at my lot.

01:03.722 --> 01:07.722
We know how to throw
a proper fucking paaaarty!

01:07.747 --> 01:13.062

01:20.580 --> 01:23.020
It's not easy having talent.

01:23.095 --> 01:26.215
I don't mean some dolly bird
dancing away on the telly

01:26.288 --> 01:28.406
with a bleedin' Border collie.

01:28.408 --> 01:32.408
I mean real, proper talent.

01:35.968 --> 01:38.166
Talent alone's not enough.

01:38.168 --> 01:41.806
It's what you do with it that counts.

01:41.808 --> 01:44.886
Take Mikey Wilson.

01:44.888 --> 01:47.726
For a while
he was Chatsworth's next big thing.

01:47.728 --> 01:51.728
Oldham, City, even old whiskey-nose
at United was said to be impressed.

01:58.168 --> 02:00.646
But less impressed
by the arrest for drink-driving

02:00.648 --> 02:02.728
and the gram of coke
in the glove box.

02:08.448 --> 02:12.448
Goodbye, Theatre of Dreams.

02:20.768 --> 02:23.326
Or then there's Gillian Cassidy,

02:23.328 --> 02:25.766
the estate's own Meryl Streep.

02:25.768 --> 02:27.606
You might remember her from Corrie.

02:27.608 --> 02:31.608
She played 'Girl That Dave Smiles At
In The Rovers' back in 2009.

02:34.968 --> 02:38.968
Sadly, Hollywood didn't
come a-knocking.

02:39.208 --> 02:43.208
Still gets to put those acting
talents to good use though.

02:50.968 --> 02:54.406
And then there's me.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.046
Tony Wilson said I had something,

02:58.048 --> 03:00.446
God bless him.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.886
Everyone said it was going to happen.

03:03.888 --> 03:07.326
Everybody was wrong.

03:07.328 --> 03:09.766
It's not too late though.

03:09.768 --> 03:13.246
But that clock's a-ticking.

03:13.248 --> 03:16.406
Just need somebody to notice me,

03:16.408 --> 03:20.366
because if nobody does,
if nobody cares,

03:20.368 --> 03:22.726
what's the point?

03:22.728 --> 03:26.728
What? I can't hear ya!
It's this bloody noise.

03:29.368 --> 03:33.368
Shit.

03:40.808 --> 03:42.446
A fucking jazz club?

03:42.448 --> 03:45.366
Can we at least
pretend we're sophisticated?

03:45.368 --> 03:47.086
You didn't mind in the Jockey.

03:47.088 --> 03:49.006
This isn't the Jockey.

03:49.008 --> 03:50.926
I thought that was just
a line for the fellas.

03:50.928 --> 03:54.046
I didn't realise we were actually
going to a fucking jazz club.

03:54.048 --> 03:57.406
Aw, she's just not wanting to show
herself up in front of her man.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.806
He's married. I'm married.

03:59.808 --> 04:01.846
He's just helping us
with our singing.

04:01.848 --> 04:03.206
Well, Bernard's not really...

04:03.208 --> 04:04.046
What?

04:04.048 --> 04:06.726
..around much.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.486
Is that him?

04:08.488 --> 04:10.006
Ooh, arse like a peach!

04:10.008 --> 04:14.008
No. He's that one... there.

04:16.327 --> 04:19.286
Oh. Nice one. Yeah.

04:19.288 --> 04:22.566
Whoooooo! Get in there!

04:22.568 --> 04:26.568
Can we at least try
and pretend to be sophisticated?

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.368 --> 04:42.046
Hey!

04:42.048 --> 04:43.086
Same again?

04:43.088 --> 04:44.126
Y'all right?

04:44.128 --> 04:47.326
Best behaviour, all of you.
I'm warning you.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.366
Louis, these are my friends.

04:49.368 --> 04:50.486
This is Louis...

04:50.488 --> 04:51.766
You were very good.

04:51.768 --> 04:54.886
Yeah. Up there,
blowin' on your big trombone.

04:54.888 --> 04:55.926
Trumpet.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.406
I didn't know you were coming.

04:57.408 --> 04:59.926
If I had, I'd have hauled
you up on stage for a song.

04:59.928 --> 05:01.886
I wouldn't want
to embarrass myself.

05:01.888 --> 05:03.406
She's very shy and retiring.

05:03.408 --> 05:05.366
Yeah, we have these karaoke nights

05:05.368 --> 05:09.166
and we practically
have to force her to do a number.

05:09.168 --> 05:12.566
Well, with a bit of luck,
the days of karaoke might be over.

05:12.568 --> 05:14.566
We're still batting things
back and forth

05:14.568 --> 05:18.006
but I've spoken to my producer
friend in Baton Rouge.

05:18.008 --> 05:19.486
I think we're on for a visit.

05:19.488 --> 05:20.646
No way?!

05:20.648 --> 05:24.206
So, our Patreesha
is gonna be a star then?

05:24.208 --> 05:28.166
Being honest, a big singer
with hit albums and sold-out tours,

05:28.168 --> 05:30.206
maybe not.

05:30.208 --> 05:34.208
But a real singer
with a real career.

05:35.728 --> 05:39.006
I think with a bit
of luck and effort,

05:39.008 --> 05:43.008
yeah, that could happen.

05:43.088 --> 05:45.806
I will drink to that.

05:45.808 --> 05:47.126
To Pat!

05:47.128 --> 05:51.128
To Pat!

05:51.688 --> 05:55.688
Eh, someone's in trouble!

05:59.808 --> 06:02.326
So, what's happening now?

06:02.328 --> 06:03.686
Right.

06:03.688 --> 06:07.688
I'm going to look into a few hotels,
draw up a schedule, and obviously

06:09.768 --> 06:12.926
we're gonna have to talk about
the financial side of things.

06:12.928 --> 06:16.928
I meant now now.

06:20.528 --> 06:21.926
Pat.

06:21.928 --> 06:22.806
Sorry.

06:22.808 --> 06:24.766
No, it's my fault.

06:24.768 --> 06:27.326
Look, it's obvious that I'm very,

06:27.328 --> 06:28.686
very fond you, but...

06:28.688 --> 06:32.006
I know - you're married.

06:32.008 --> 06:34.246
My wife spends
most of the time away.

06:34.248 --> 06:36.206
I mean, we're further apart
than strangers.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.766
It's barely a marriage at all.

06:38.768 --> 06:42.768
No, no, no, this is about you, Pat.

06:44.168 --> 06:46.766
It's your big chance, kid,

06:46.768 --> 06:50.768
and I don't want to screw things up
by mixing business with...

06:52.768 --> 06:56.768
Still, as the expression goes

06:57.368 --> 07:01.368
"What happens in Baton Rouge..."

07:08.688 --> 07:12.688
We've got enough mouths to feed
without involving the feline world.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.566
But Princess has got no home.
Dad, please!

07:16.568 --> 07:20.126
Lesson in life, kiddo. Never
rely on the kindness of strangers.

07:20.128 --> 07:23.206
Plus, Princess has got a penis,
so technically

07:23.208 --> 07:27.208
if he's going to be a royal,
he's a prince, or a duke at least.

07:35.968 --> 07:37.086
What are you doing?

07:37.088 --> 07:38.486
Nothing.

07:38.488 --> 07:40.046
Oh, yeah?

07:40.048 --> 07:42.446
I need them for school.
All the lads are doing it.

07:42.448 --> 07:44.486
Right,
you get tatters deep in some woman

07:44.488 --> 07:48.126
then you bring her panties in
and everyone has a sniff of 'em.

07:48.128 --> 07:50.326
Why didn't you just nick
one of your mam's?

07:50.328 --> 07:53.046
You are sick!

07:53.048 --> 07:57.048
And don't tell me mam either.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.046
Fuck you playing at?

08:03.048 --> 08:05.606
I'm just returning your property.

08:05.608 --> 08:07.566
It's a funny story actually.

08:07.568 --> 08:11.568
Put my pants down!

08:17.328 --> 08:18.926
Next month?

08:18.928 --> 08:21.926
Tickets are all booked.
Never been to America.

08:21.928 --> 08:23.886
Louis goes all the time.

08:23.888 --> 08:27.206
God, it's really happening, isn't it?

08:27.208 --> 08:30.406
Just don't forget us little people when
you're swanning round in your private jet.

08:30.408 --> 08:33.525
Not gonna be like that.

08:33.528 --> 08:36.366
That's my 18th sorted.
Stev said I can have it at his.

08:36.368 --> 08:37.405
Stev?

08:37.408 --> 08:40.486
Do you think his parents are fine
with him throwing some big party?

08:40.488 --> 08:44.488
Nah, doesn't live with his parents.
He squats.

08:46.368 --> 08:50.368
Let's take this
through to the bedroom.

08:53.488 --> 08:57.488
Do you know what would be even
better? Big party at the Jockey.

08:57.888 --> 08:59.806
Nah, I'd rather have a car.

08:59.808 --> 09:01.646
Impress all your friends.

09:01.648 --> 09:05.206
18-years-old, already a regular
in a pub, everybody knows your name.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.326
Dead impressive, that.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.766
We could have champagne. A free bar!

09:08.768 --> 09:10.968
Just leave it with us, love.
Within budget.

09:12.728 --> 09:15.366
Shit, that's Louis.
I've not finished putting my face on.

09:15.368 --> 09:17.126
Just about the career then?

09:17.128 --> 09:21.128
Shut it.

09:25.288 --> 09:28.846
# Another bride

09:28.848 --> 09:31.966
# Another tune

09:31.968 --> 09:35.726
# Another sunny

09:35.728 --> 09:39.406
# Honeymoon

09:39.408 --> 09:42.526
# Another season

09:42.528 --> 09:45.926
# Another reason

09:45.928 --> 09:49.928
# For making whoopee

09:52.528 --> 09:55.686
# A lot of shoes

09:55.688 --> 09:58.966
# A lot of rice

09:58.968 --> 10:02.446
# The groom is nervous

10:02.448 --> 10:06.448
# He answers twice

10:06.648 --> 10:10.286
# It's really killing

10:10.288 --> 10:14.288
# That he's so willing

10:15.048 --> 10:17.526
# To make

10:17.528 --> 10:21.528
# Whoopee. #

10:23.288 --> 10:27.288
How have you remained a secret
all this time, Pat?

10:27.888 --> 10:29.846
That was a little
bit off in the chorus.

10:29.848 --> 10:32.846
Never be afraid to aim for notes
that are out of your range.

10:32.848 --> 10:35.246
They are words to live by.

10:35.248 --> 10:36.446
Do you think I could, erm...

10:36.448 --> 10:40.448
Just that way.

10:44.008 --> 10:45.806
I was totally flat, wasn't I?

10:45.808 --> 10:49.808
You're going places, our kid.

10:59.088 --> 11:00.206
You're barred.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.728
What?

11:03.928 --> 11:06.406
Oh, that? Minor misunderstanding.

11:06.408 --> 11:08.646
You stole me mam's knickers
off the line.

11:08.648 --> 11:12.046
That's pretty major in my book
and you've not apologised yet.

11:12.048 --> 11:15.846
Yes, well, of course, in the shadowy
world of underwear thieves,

11:15.848 --> 11:19.848
your mother's unmentionables have
long been considered the Holy Grail.

11:22.768 --> 11:24.606
B-A-R-R-E-D.

11:24.608 --> 11:28.608
Barred!

11:53.928 --> 11:55.846
# All of me

11:55.848 --> 11:58.408
# Why not take all of me? #

12:03.688 --> 12:05.688
Come on, come on, Pat, come on!

12:21.688 --> 12:23.526
Louis!

12:23.528 --> 12:24.606
Jesus.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.806
Shit! Call an ambulance!

12:26.808 --> 12:28.886
Fuck! My phone! Where's yours?

12:28.888 --> 12:32.606
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

12:32.608 --> 12:34.926
OK, um, Louis?

12:34.928 --> 12:36.966
What is it?

12:36.968 --> 12:40.968
Pills? You've got pills in there?

12:41.808 --> 12:44.486
Louis!

12:44.488 --> 12:48.246
No, no. Come on, love.

12:48.248 --> 12:49.606
Stay out of the light!

12:49.608 --> 12:50.286
Pat.

12:50.288 --> 12:51.406
Come on!

12:51.408 --> 12:55.408
Pat!

12:56.688 --> 12:58.134
Bloody hell.

13:02.409 --> 13:04.049
It's gotta be dodgy.

13:04.168 --> 13:07.486
Nobody carries
this much cash around with them.

13:07.488 --> 13:11.166
He's dead.

13:11.168 --> 13:14.888
Look, I know you cared about him.
A lot.

13:15.265 --> 13:18.865
Just died, right here in my living
room.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.164
Pat, what are we going to
do about the money?

13:21.166 --> 13:23.364
Why not take his shoes
while you're at it?

13:23.366 --> 13:25.844
Might get a couple of quid for them
down at the market.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.844
I'm thinking about you. Baton Rouge.

13:28.846 --> 13:31.244
America. Producer.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.486
All that takes money.

13:35.406 --> 13:39.406
Hello? Paramedics.
Can you open the door, please?

13:50.203 --> 13:52.761
Stand back, please.

13:52.763 --> 13:56.763
Is he breathing?

13:58.363 --> 14:02.363
Airway's clear,
but he's non responsive. No output.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.761
I've just been banned from the
Jockey. And you want to know why?

14:07.763 --> 14:11.081
They're saying that
I nicked Mimi Maguire's underwear

14:11.083 --> 14:13.601
for the purposes of...

14:13.603 --> 14:15.961
of 'personal gratification'.

14:15.963 --> 14:17.403
I'm not going to judge you, Frank.

14:17.477 --> 14:20.757
Because it wasn't me!

14:21.571 --> 14:24.311
Tell her.

14:24.381 --> 14:26.741
Tell her. Tell her that you stole
the witch's underwear

14:26.765 --> 14:28.923
so you could take it to school
and sniff it!

14:28.925 --> 14:32.603
I don't know what he's
talking about.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.843
Jesus, that's low, Frank,
even for you.

14:34.845 --> 14:38.845
Me? I'm the innocent party!

14:46.365 --> 14:48.763
Hello?

14:48.765 --> 14:52.765
It's only me,
just your friendly neighbourhood...

14:54.165 --> 14:58.165
person. I'm just here to discuss
the misunderstanding.

15:00.165 --> 15:04.165
Hello?

15:14.725 --> 15:18.725
Oh, fucking hell.

15:25.445 --> 15:28.803
So. Also a funny story...

15:28.805 --> 15:32.805
You fucking pervert!

15:41.285 --> 15:45.285
The lock's been forced.

15:45.525 --> 15:47.323
Wait, is that what your look meant?

15:47.325 --> 15:49.923
Because my look was all,
"Let's get out of here, right now."

15:49.925 --> 15:53.925
We'll be in and out in five minutes.

16:04.805 --> 16:06.365
You sure he's got a wife..?

16:06.471 --> 16:09.029
Of course he's got a wife.
Why would he have lied about that?

16:09.031 --> 16:12.389
I don't know. Just seems a bit...

16:12.391 --> 16:14.229
bachelor-esque.

16:14.231 --> 16:17.829
Magic. Let's break in
and critique the decor.

16:17.831 --> 16:21.831
Fine. Just see if he's got any
contact lists, laptop, rolodex,
whatever.

16:24.431 --> 16:28.431
Proper little Miss Marple,
aren't you?

16:37.351 --> 16:41.269
That's the problem with
nosing about.

16:41.271 --> 16:43.669
You look hard and long enough,

16:43.671 --> 16:46.749
you're bound to turn up something
you wish you hadn't.

16:46.751 --> 16:50.749
So says Mr Darren bloody Smith.

16:50.751 --> 16:54.751
Louis works much
better as a stage name.

16:55.711 --> 16:59.029
Travel to America
all the time, did you?

16:59.031 --> 17:02.269
Doesn't look great, does it?

17:02.271 --> 17:05.749
No.

17:05.751 --> 17:09.751
You were special to me, you know.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.868
What is it exactly that you don't
trust, Pat?

17:13.871 --> 17:17.871
My intentions,
or your own talent?

17:19.991 --> 17:21.388
Any luck?

17:21.391 --> 17:24.309
Yeah. Great. Got all the details.

17:24.310 --> 17:28.310
Baton Rouge here you come.

18:14.391 --> 18:17.989
That's my wash on.
I'll put it out later.

18:17.991 --> 18:19.869
You all right, Mum?

18:19.871 --> 18:23.871
Wonderful, love.

18:36.391 --> 18:37.509
Hello?

18:37.511 --> 18:38.749
Avril?

18:38.751 --> 18:41.869
No. This is her phone.
I'm her sister.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.309
Ah. Just to let you know that
I've spoken to the owners

18:45.311 --> 18:49.069
and we're all set, so if you can
just drop the cash deposit off at
the office,

18:49.071 --> 18:51.989
we'll get the paperwork
signed and the flat's all hers.

18:51.991 --> 18:54.349
Fantastic. Thanks.

18:54.351 --> 18:58.351
Bye now.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.629
I can't believe she'd do this to me.

19:01.631 --> 19:05.149
Pound signs spinning in her eyes
the moment she saw that money.

19:05.151 --> 19:08.829
A chance to get away from you.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.269
Mary Mae only visits
when she wants to.

19:11.271 --> 19:15.271
And as for Bernard... Well,
we all know about your husband.

19:19.271 --> 19:23.271
But your sister...

19:24.391 --> 19:26.629
That's a knife in the back.

19:26.631 --> 19:29.389
A wound that runs deep.

19:29.391 --> 19:33.391
Everybody thinks
I'm a fucking mug.

19:36.391 --> 19:38.949
I didn't.

19:38.951 --> 19:41.469
I don't know that any more.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.469
I don't know anything.

19:43.471 --> 19:46.989
You deserve that money.

19:46.991 --> 19:50.991
You deserve it for all them bastards
that have used you, cast you aside.

19:52.231 --> 19:54.869
You deserve all of it.

19:54.871 --> 19:58.871
Every last penny.

20:01.751 --> 20:05.751
This is your time.

20:10.431 --> 20:13.429
Oh, ta, kid.
Good to know you're on my side.

20:13.431 --> 20:14.909
Two quid.

20:14.911 --> 20:16.909
What?

20:16.911 --> 20:20.911
Oh! Oh, OK, there you go.

20:21.271 --> 20:23.989
Keep the change.
Buy yourself something nice.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.749
Two quid.

20:25.751 --> 20:29.269
You sent away Princess.
Everyone is right.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.629
You're a bad man.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.389
Everyone? Everyone!

20:32.391 --> 20:35.471
We're talking a small,
narrow-minded minority here...

20:48.951 --> 20:52.951
Ah, fuck.

21:01.431 --> 21:04.629
I came home,
they'd got in somehow.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.989
They must have been
looking for the money.

21:06.991 --> 21:08.069
Look at this mess.

21:08.071 --> 21:09.669
Jesus.

21:09.671 --> 21:12.469
Yeah.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.989
Luckily I had the money on me.

21:14.991 --> 21:18.991
I don't feel safe any more.
We need to get out of here.

21:23.871 --> 21:26.669
It's only for a few days.
It won't be that bad.

21:26.671 --> 21:29.669
Have you ever lived with my mum?
She's mental.

21:29.671 --> 21:32.949
She's all right. And I did it for
you. Thought you'd be happy.

21:32.951 --> 21:35.509
Oh, yeah. Stuck in a pokey
little flat with two of them.

21:35.511 --> 21:39.509
Yeah, best news ever.

21:39.511 --> 21:41.949
Who do you think it is
that's after the cash?

21:41.951 --> 21:43.989
Dunno.

21:43.991 --> 21:47.349
Loan sharks.
Moss Side drug dealers.

21:47.351 --> 21:51.351
Whoever it is,
they obviously want their money back.

21:52.231 --> 21:55.269
Maybe we should never have
taken the cash in the first place.

21:55.271 --> 21:57.829
It's a bit late for that now.

21:57.831 --> 22:00.749
You never did tell me what
you intend to do with your share.

22:00.751 --> 22:04.389
Haven't really thought about it.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.029
25 grand, though.

22:07.031 --> 22:09.669
That'd be enough to, I dunno,

22:09.671 --> 22:11.989
put down a deposit on a new place.

22:11.991 --> 22:15.709
Like I said, haven't really
thought that far ahead.

22:15.711 --> 22:17.669
When were you going to tell me?

22:17.671 --> 22:20.869
I mean,
am I really that much of burden

22:20.871 --> 22:23.469
that you'd keep pushing
and shoving me off to America,

22:23.471 --> 22:27.309
same time you're plotting a way
to move out without even a word...

22:27.311 --> 22:30.749
Maybe if you weren't
such a fucking victim all the time,
I wouldn't have to.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.589
Course. It's all my fault.

22:32.591 --> 22:36.591
No, no, actually.
It's everybody else's.

22:37.071 --> 22:39.789
It's Bernard's fault
you were too blind to the fact

22:39.791 --> 22:42.109
that he's as bent
as a Curly Wurly.

22:42.111 --> 22:46.111
It'll be Louis' fault
that your career will never
amount to anything,

22:46.431 --> 22:50.431
and it'll be my fault that
you're all on your own
with no-one to complain to.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.469
Right.

22:52.471 --> 22:56.471
This one is definitely my fault then.

22:58.031 --> 23:01.909
Where are you going?

23:01.911 --> 23:05.789
Pat!

23:05.791 --> 23:08.309
This is all you fucking care about.

23:08.311 --> 23:11.669
Mum! What you doing?

23:11.671 --> 23:15.149
Don't!

23:15.151 --> 23:17.149
Fuck!

23:17.151 --> 23:19.689
Like I said...
Won't be that bad.

23:27.755 --> 23:29.273
So you stole the money?

23:29.275 --> 23:33.275
No. We were just
holding on to it until...

23:34.155 --> 23:36.033
Yeah. We stole it.

23:36.035 --> 23:39.313
Maybe she was trying to protect you.
Burn the evidence.

23:39.315 --> 23:42.553
No, she's doing
what she always does.

23:42.555 --> 23:46.555
Making sure the whole fucking world
revolves around her.

23:47.755 --> 23:51.755
She burnt £50,000!

23:59.875 --> 24:01.033
Where's the bag?

24:01.035 --> 24:02.113
She binned it.

24:02.115 --> 24:06.115
Fuck's sake!

24:18.475 --> 24:22.475
'You deserve that money.
You deserve all of it.'

24:23.875 --> 24:25.273
She's fucking set me up.

24:25.275 --> 24:26.873
I told you she were mental.

24:26.875 --> 24:29.633
The break-in. The danger...

24:29.635 --> 24:33.193
It's all distractions so she can
take every penny for herself.

24:33.195 --> 24:34.833
Don't you get it?

24:34.835 --> 24:38.073
I can honestly say
I've no idea what's going on.

24:38.075 --> 24:39.793
Wait.

24:39.795 --> 24:42.833
Does this mean you'll be staying
with us or you're moving out?

24:42.835 --> 24:44.633
Give me one day, Ches,

24:44.635 --> 24:48.635
and you won't see me for dust.

24:54.435 --> 24:56.353
Nice car.

24:56.355 --> 24:58.913
Yeah. It's my cousin's.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.995
Looks like I'm having
the party at the Jockey.

25:01.185 --> 25:02.503
Sweet. Just...

25:02.505 --> 25:04.903
Just text us the details, yeah?

25:04.905 --> 25:07.145
Don't need to - you're right here.

25:10.105 --> 25:12.783
What the hell?

25:12.785 --> 25:14.063
You arsehole.

25:14.065 --> 25:16.783
It's not what it looks like!

25:16.785 --> 25:18.543
It's only a blow job.

25:18.545 --> 25:21.183
She's my cousin.
It's not like it counts!

25:21.185 --> 25:25.185
You can shut it an' all.

25:33.105 --> 25:34.903
It's Gallagher, isn't it?

25:34.905 --> 25:37.623
Frank Gallagher?

25:37.625 --> 25:39.703
I'm Maurice O'Neill.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.343
I live in the courts, flat 19.

25:42.345 --> 25:45.503
Congratulations.

25:45.505 --> 25:47.623
Aye, very good.

25:47.625 --> 25:51.183
No, it's just I heard about your...
little incident.

25:51.185 --> 25:54.345
Oh, yeah? What are you, then? Some
have-a-go-hero - Pride of Britain,

25:54.365 --> 25:56.883
want to make a name for yourself,
do you? Go on - try it. Dare you.

25:56.885 --> 25:59.363
Quite the opposite.

25:59.365 --> 26:03.365
I think it's disgusting
how this place has treated you.

26:06.205 --> 26:09.443
The black beating heart of
our Big Society, that is.

26:09.445 --> 26:13.083
Thou shalt judge thy fellow man,
dob him in, hound him out.

26:13.085 --> 26:15.283
Divided we shall stand.

26:15.285 --> 26:18.123
Lessons ripped straight
from the playbooks

26:18.125 --> 26:20.323
of the Gestapo and the Stasi...

26:20.325 --> 26:24.325
Couldn't agree more.
It's a fallen world.

26:25.565 --> 26:29.565
Do you like a drink, Mr Gallagher?

26:29.645 --> 26:33.643
Maybe I should write a book -
Touched By A Filthy Bugger.

26:33.645 --> 26:35.203
Frank didn't actually touch you.

26:35.205 --> 26:39.205
He pinched me fuckin' knickers.
Exposed himself to me.

26:39.485 --> 26:41.123
Right, yeah, he's a twat

26:41.125 --> 26:43.563
but I've never had him down
for one of them perverts.

26:43.565 --> 26:45.403
He hasn't the energy to
wave his fucking dick about.

26:45.405 --> 26:49.323
Probably a misunderstanding.

26:49.325 --> 26:53.325
Flyers. I should hand out
more flyers. Warn people.

26:59.765 --> 27:03.765
Oh!

27:03.925 --> 27:07.925
Hello, old friend.

27:08.285 --> 27:11.283
It's been a while.

27:11.285 --> 27:12.963
Busy? Nope.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.803
Good. I need your help.

27:16.805 --> 27:20.805
I want you to kidnap my daughter.

27:20.965 --> 27:24.965
I just want to say something -
this is a bad idea.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.483
Fake kidnappings always backfire.

27:27.485 --> 27:29.003
Let me worry about that.

27:29.005 --> 27:31.923
All right. I'm just saying.
Your sister finds out about this

27:31.925 --> 27:34.643
and your relationship
is fucked for ever.

27:34.645 --> 27:37.483
Even worse, some nutjob finds
out about this or the cash...

27:37.485 --> 27:39.043
and you've got proper trouble.

27:39.045 --> 27:41.163
You know what the estate's like -
nobody can keep a fucking secret.

27:41.165 --> 27:43.243
I'm not asking this as a favour.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.963
I'll pay you.

27:44.965 --> 27:48.965
200 quid - and you can keep
your opinions to yourself.

27:49.445 --> 27:52.243
How much is she going for?

27:52.245 --> 27:53.683
50 grand.

27:53.685 --> 27:56.963
Fuck off! She's not worth that much.

27:56.965 --> 28:00.083
She's worth... much more.

28:00.085 --> 28:03.563
I just need her to hang out
here for a day, out of view.

28:03.565 --> 28:06.123
And for you to pick up the money
when it comes through.

28:06.125 --> 28:10.125
See, you're making this sound
really nice and easy, aren't you?

28:10.765 --> 28:14.003
What you're really
talking about here is serious fraud.

28:14.005 --> 28:16.363
And Shane doesn't get out of bed
for less than 500.

28:16.365 --> 28:18.323
Done. A thousand.

28:18.325 --> 28:19.483
What's my cut?

28:19.485 --> 28:21.403
- You get your party.
- No.

28:21.405 --> 28:25.405
Fine, I'll buy you a bloody car.
And you, 700 - final offer.

28:29.565 --> 28:32.963
I like to think of us all
as snowflakes.

28:32.965 --> 28:35.243
Each is special and unique -

28:35.245 --> 28:38.483
mysterious in our ways.

28:38.485 --> 28:42.485
Exactly. But that's
not what they want, is it?

28:42.645 --> 28:46.645
Society full of obedient little
robots, punching the time clocks,

28:47.125 --> 28:49.883
saluting the CCTV as they pass.

28:49.885 --> 28:53.643
The main thing is, we accept
all colours under the rainbow.

28:53.645 --> 28:57.083
As I've often said,
it's our differences that unite us.

28:57.085 --> 29:01.085
But you'll be able to share
that with the others soon.

29:01.765 --> 29:04.203
Right. The other... whats?

29:04.205 --> 29:06.483
Of our little brotherhood.

29:06.485 --> 29:09.363
Men of... certain tastes.

29:09.365 --> 29:12.603
Oh, I'm not really
a brotherhood sort of person.

29:12.605 --> 29:14.603
More of a lone wolf.

29:14.605 --> 29:17.923
Because society has made you that.

29:17.925 --> 29:21.363
Oh, it took me some time to
be strong and finally admit that,

29:21.365 --> 29:25.365
hey, I am sexually aroused by
anthropomorphic animal characters.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.403
Eh?

29:27.405 --> 29:31.123
It think it was Soo from The Sooty
Show that first caused a quiver -

29:31.125 --> 29:33.163
do you remember her?

29:33.165 --> 29:37.165
Dirty wee panda
in that teeny-weeny red skirt.

29:39.285 --> 29:42.003
Have you ever wondered
what a panda would look like

29:42.005 --> 29:44.323
with breast implants, Mr Gallagher?

29:44.325 --> 29:47.203
I'll just take these
for the road, shall I?

29:47.205 --> 29:49.883
Don't be scared, Mr Gallagher.
You're amongst friends now.

29:49.885 --> 29:51.483
You're no fucking friend of mine!

29:51.485 --> 29:53.883
Where are you going to run?
There's nowhere left for you to go.

29:53.885 --> 29:55.283
Hey!

29:55.285 --> 29:59.285
We're all you've got!

29:59.325 --> 30:01.603
You were right.

30:01.605 --> 30:05.605
I should never have
taken that money.

30:06.165 --> 30:08.803
My own daughter, Pat.

30:08.805 --> 30:12.123
My own fucking daughter!

30:12.125 --> 30:16.125
What we going to do?

30:16.845 --> 30:18.123
You pay the ransom.

30:18.125 --> 30:19.403
With what?

30:19.405 --> 30:23.405
I've got fuck all!

30:24.365 --> 30:28.365
I think we should call the police.

30:28.845 --> 30:30.883
Avs...

30:30.885 --> 30:33.683
I didn't...

30:33.685 --> 30:36.203
I didn't burn the money.

30:36.205 --> 30:39.803
I've still got it.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.803
All of it.

30:41.805 --> 30:44.643
No, you did.

30:44.645 --> 30:46.363
I saw you.

30:46.365 --> 30:48.363
No.

30:48.365 --> 30:51.363
I switched it
before we even got here.

30:51.365 --> 30:53.363
I just got so...

30:53.365 --> 30:56.083
screwed up about you leaving.

30:56.085 --> 30:59.203
I'm sorry.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.963
So...

31:01.965 --> 31:04.683
..we can...

31:04.685 --> 31:08.523
We can pay the ransom.

31:08.525 --> 31:10.603
It's my problem.

31:10.605 --> 31:14.605
I brought Louis,
that money, into our lives...

31:16.725 --> 31:20.725
Come here.

31:41.765 --> 31:43.483
What ya doing? Nothing.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.003
Doesn't look like nothing.

31:45.005 --> 31:48.843
Playing hide and seek.
And you're it. Go on. Go and hide.

31:48.845 --> 31:52.845
All right. But no peekin'.

31:59.445 --> 32:03.445
I told you, piss off.

32:07.325 --> 32:09.843
I'm just so, so sorry.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.043
Yeah, I know.

32:11.045 --> 32:14.243
No, I mean for trying to stop you
having your own life.

32:14.245 --> 32:16.763
I've failed at everything -
career, love...

32:16.765 --> 32:18.203
I just didn't want to admit

32:18.205 --> 32:21.603
I'd failed at being a sister
as well, you know?

32:21.605 --> 32:23.003
Is that them?

32:23.005 --> 32:26.643
No. Over there.

32:26.645 --> 32:27.923
Fuckin' hell.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.163
Fucking hell!

32:29.165 --> 32:33.165
Money.

32:42.565 --> 32:46.565
If you've done anything to her...

32:47.245 --> 32:50.403
Mum! I was so scared!
I thought I'd never see you again.

32:50.405 --> 32:54.323
Enough with the dramatics.
Tone it down.

32:54.325 --> 32:56.443
I want you to know something.

32:56.445 --> 32:58.683
I will find out who you are.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.323
And I will hurt you
for what you've done to my family.

33:01.325 --> 33:04.883
All right? Mimi wants me to make
sure everyone's got one of these.

33:04.885 --> 33:06.123
Billy...

33:06.125 --> 33:09.203
No, I know she's gone a bit psycho
over the whole thing, but...

33:09.205 --> 33:11.923
she's the wife -
her who must be obeyed.

33:11.925 --> 33:14.723
Here y'are, Shane.
I love that bally, mate.

33:14.725 --> 33:16.883
I'm not Shane.

33:16.885 --> 33:19.843
What? You are. Remember
you wore that last Christmas,

33:19.845 --> 33:21.163
at the big snowball fight -

33:21.165 --> 33:23.843
the one where you kept
going on about getting frostbite.

33:23.845 --> 33:26.443
I mean, come on, seriously -
it wasn't even cold

33:26.445 --> 33:29.443
and this guy's like Scott
of the friggin' Antarctic.

33:29.445 --> 33:30.403
What the fuck?

33:30.405 --> 33:33.483
Her idea.

33:33.485 --> 33:35.843
You tried to rip me off?

33:35.845 --> 33:38.643
You tried to rip me off first!

33:38.645 --> 33:42.645
Catfight in three, two, one...

33:53.725 --> 33:57.725
Come on!

34:00.325 --> 34:01.824
Fucker!

34:19.315 --> 34:21.833
What the fuck?

34:21.835 --> 34:25.034
It's all right. He's my neighbour,
so it doesn't count.

34:25.036 --> 34:29.036
Twat.

34:29.876 --> 34:32.714
I'm going to be polite.
Going to be nice.

34:32.716 --> 34:34.956
Going to plaster on
a fake fucking smile

34:34.967 --> 34:36.806
for your daughter's birthday party.

34:36.808 --> 34:40.128
But after that, we split the cash
and go our separate ways.

34:40.572 --> 34:42.091
End of.

34:42.092 --> 34:46.092
Fine by me.

35:03.533 --> 35:05.793
You're Patreesha, aren't you?
You knew Louis.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.441
He died at your house.

35:07.443 --> 35:08.561
What makes you say that?

35:08.563 --> 35:10.601
One of us has a mate
in the hospitals.

35:10.603 --> 35:13.561
Gave us the details.
About poor Darren Smith.

35:13.563 --> 35:14.881
Are you family?

35:14.883 --> 35:16.121
No. Far from it.

35:16.123 --> 35:18.921
We're trying to get the money back.

35:18.923 --> 35:21.001
The money he stole from all of us.

35:21.003 --> 35:23.441
We don't know anything
about that... your money.

35:23.443 --> 35:26.241
Louis comes over all caring.

35:26.243 --> 35:28.081
Pretends to be married
so you feel safe.

35:28.083 --> 35:31.801
Says you're unique, has a producer
friend in Baton Rouge,

35:31.803 --> 35:34.241
just needs some cash
for the plane ticket

35:34.243 --> 35:35.561
and he buggers off.

35:35.563 --> 35:38.281
He's been pulling the scam
all over Manchester...

35:38.283 --> 35:39.961
Ladies...

35:39.963 --> 35:42.561
I'm sorry you were conned, but...

35:42.563 --> 35:44.721
We don't know anything
about your cash.

35:44.723 --> 35:45.961
What's in the bag?

35:45.963 --> 35:48.841
I think you've made a mistake.

35:48.843 --> 35:52.843
And as you can see,
this is a private party.

35:53.603 --> 35:56.481
You don't want to be asked
to leave twice.

35:56.483 --> 36:00.483
Seriously.

36:06.763 --> 36:08.761
He didn't ask you for cash, did he?

36:08.763 --> 36:10.441
Course he fucking didn't.

36:10.443 --> 36:11.561
Maybe we should...

36:11.563 --> 36:12.801
Return the money?

36:12.803 --> 36:15.721
I earned this. This is mine.

36:15.723 --> 36:18.441
They're probably
full of bullshit anyway.

36:18.443 --> 36:22.443
Surprised you didn't get on
with them better.

36:28.443 --> 36:31.921
What do you want to say to Frank?

36:31.923 --> 36:34.561
Tam.

36:34.563 --> 36:37.801
Sorry, Mr Gallagher.

36:37.803 --> 36:39.721
Well, all right, no harm done.

36:39.723 --> 36:42.801
So if you can get your arse out
there and tell the rest of them...

36:42.803 --> 36:44.281
No, Frank.

36:44.283 --> 36:47.641
I'm a pariah.
I've been barred from the pub!

36:47.643 --> 36:50.601
Harangued by strangers
and neighbours alike.

36:50.603 --> 36:54.603
Groomed by weirdos
who like pandas with breasts!

36:54.963 --> 36:56.601
People will get over it.

36:56.603 --> 36:58.441
People will feed on it!

36:58.443 --> 37:01.241
They'll keep it going and going
until I'm driven off the estate.

37:01.243 --> 37:03.881
I'm not throwing my son
to the wolves.

37:03.883 --> 37:05.561
Maybe if you spoke to Mimi...

37:05.563 --> 37:07.081
Tried that. Didn't work!

37:07.083 --> 37:09.161
Maybe you didn't say
the right thing.

37:09.163 --> 37:10.521
I'm the aggrieved party.

37:10.523 --> 37:13.601
Why the fuck should I help you
and klepto boy over here?

37:13.603 --> 37:17.603
I'm the best bloody neighbour
you'll ever have.

37:19.323 --> 37:21.401
It's your word against me and Tam.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.641
Who do you think
everyone's going to believe?

37:23.643 --> 37:25.361
Really.

37:25.363 --> 37:29.363
Just tell her you did it for love.

37:32.763 --> 37:36.601
I'll show you what I found
in his locker.

37:36.603 --> 37:39.801
And if you're anything
like the others...

37:39.803 --> 37:43.803
you'll probably want this as well.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.041
No need to read on, love.

38:00.043 --> 38:04.043
It's only going to hurt you.

38:04.523 --> 38:08.523
Very well, then.

38:10.003 --> 38:13.321
"Patreesha St Rose.

38:13.323 --> 38:15.441
"Middle aged, lonely,

38:15.443 --> 38:18.601
"clearly looking for somebody
to believe in her.

38:18.603 --> 38:22.481
"Given the right attention,
will most likely be...

38:22.483 --> 38:26.483
"a push-over."

38:27.403 --> 38:31.403
Are you sure you want to hear this?

38:39.123 --> 38:40.961
Avril was right.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.921
You've got victim written
all over you.

38:42.923 --> 38:45.681
You're so self-centred that
anyone who spends any time with you

38:45.683 --> 38:47.921
just wants to hurt you
or get the fuck away from you,

38:47.923 --> 38:51.001
as fast as they can.

38:51.003 --> 38:55.001
Worst thing is...

38:55.003 --> 38:57.161
..you miss me.

38:57.163 --> 38:59.121
Because you're grateful,

38:59.123 --> 39:02.721
pathetically grateful,
for the crumbs I threw you.

39:02.723 --> 39:06.723
Fuck off!

39:17.443 --> 39:21.443
I stole your underwear because...

39:22.243 --> 39:25.201
..I am sexually attracted to you.

39:25.203 --> 39:26.081
Twat him.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.281
For what?

39:27.283 --> 39:28.521
For what he's just said.

39:28.523 --> 39:29.841
It was a compliment.

39:29.843 --> 39:31.961
I know I don't mean
the same to you.

39:31.963 --> 39:34.321
You don't remember
the first time we met.

39:34.323 --> 39:38.323
You don't arrange your day so that
you bump into me accidentally.

39:38.883 --> 39:41.801
You don't mourn all the little
choices that we've made

39:41.803 --> 39:45.441
that have led us down
separate paths. But... I do.

39:45.443 --> 39:49.443
I, Vernon Francis Gallagher,
am so in love with you

39:51.043 --> 39:55.043
that I had no choice
but to steal your underwear

39:55.563 --> 39:59.563
and expose myself to you.

40:02.323 --> 40:04.881
I feel sorry for you, Frank.

40:04.883 --> 40:06.641
You're so messed up in there.

40:06.643 --> 40:09.201
But...

40:09.203 --> 40:11.041
..I'll accept yer apology.

40:11.043 --> 40:13.721
It's very gracious of you.

40:13.723 --> 40:17.723
This good lady's paying for my tab.

40:20.203 --> 40:21.961
Go on, then.

40:21.963 --> 40:24.081
You poor bastard.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.641
We've always been mates,
but now I'm thinking...

40:26.643 --> 40:29.281
ain't that the best way
to start off a relationship?

40:29.283 --> 40:30.321
A mate with tits. Perfect.

40:30.323 --> 40:31.481
Yeah.

40:31.483 --> 40:33.041
You want to slow down there, mate.

40:33.043 --> 40:37.043
What? She's all over me, man.
I'm hot shit.

40:37.603 --> 40:41.603
Eh.

40:42.963 --> 40:46.561
Rule of thumb.
Teenage girls love bad boys.

40:46.563 --> 40:48.601
Fuckin' great, innit?

40:48.603 --> 40:50.841
Don't worry, she'll get sick of it
and you'll be there

40:50.843 --> 40:51.921
to pick up the pieces.

40:51.923 --> 40:55.923
Just give it... five, six years
at least.

40:59.243 --> 41:00.481
Pat.

41:00.483 --> 41:04.483
You can fuck off as well.

41:06.763 --> 41:10.763
Hey! What you doing? Cheeky cow.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.361
My name is Patreesha

41:13.363 --> 41:16.841
and I'm a failure.

41:16.843 --> 41:20.843
My husband Bernard
likes to fuck other men.

41:21.243 --> 41:24.841
My daughter doesn't ever bother
coming round any more.

41:24.843 --> 41:26.681
Don't blame her.

41:26.683 --> 41:30.683
And my sister just wants
to get the hell away from me.

41:31.163 --> 41:34.841
Again, no blame.

41:34.843 --> 41:38.843
But the man I loved, Louis,

41:39.923 --> 41:42.801
he saw something in me

41:42.803 --> 41:46.803
that I didn't know existed
until today.

41:48.403 --> 41:52.403
He saw... a sucker!

41:53.283 --> 41:56.241
Someone so desperate

41:56.243 --> 42:00.243
that he could rip me off
without breaking sweat.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.921
Well...

42:03.923 --> 42:07.923
I ripped him off
for 50 fucking grand!

42:09.123 --> 42:12.201
So who's the sucker now, you cunt?!

42:12.203 --> 42:13.521
Bloody hell...

42:13.523 --> 42:16.721
Yeah, that's right...50 grand!

42:16.723 --> 42:19.841
And it's all for me. I deserve it!

42:19.843 --> 42:23.843
So rot in hell,
you conniving bastard!

42:24.683 --> 42:26.041
Get your hands off me!

42:26.043 --> 42:28.281
For fuck's sake. D'you want
to highlight the fact

42:28.283 --> 42:30.961
we've got 50 grand in a place
like this?! Come on!

42:30.963 --> 42:34.963
It's just one big note, is it?

42:36.483 --> 42:39.801
Jesus, Pat!

42:39.803 --> 42:41.401
You never told me
you gave him money.

42:41.403 --> 42:43.201
Like you fucking care.

42:43.203 --> 42:44.641
Of course I care.

42:44.643 --> 42:48.643
Can fuck off with the rest of 'em!

43:00.043 --> 43:03.481
Nah, not having some wing-nuts

43:03.483 --> 43:05.601
put the shits up me.

43:05.603 --> 43:09.361
Go on. Piss off and take it.
S'what you want.

43:09.363 --> 43:12.761
I'm not leaving you.

43:12.763 --> 43:16.081
Right, what do you two twats want?

43:16.083 --> 43:17.283
Dunno. 50 grand'd do it.

43:18.563 --> 43:22.563
Come on then, take it.
I fucking dare you!

43:25.323 --> 43:28.441
You got a problem with them,
you got a problem with us.

43:28.443 --> 43:32.443
Who are you?
Fucking Neighbourhood Watch?

43:40.523 --> 43:41.841
Where can we take you?

43:41.843 --> 43:43.001
Just home...

43:43.003 --> 43:45.881
Fuck that. There's a party.

43:45.883 --> 43:49.883
Uh, look... We might know
where the money is and...

43:51.563 --> 43:55.441
..we'll probably be able
to get it back to you.

43:55.443 --> 43:58.161
Definitely be able
to get it back to you.

43:58.163 --> 43:59.321
Fair's fair.

43:59.323 --> 44:03.323
Are we going to the bloody party
or what?!

44:10.043 --> 44:14.043
Yeah! Ooh-hoo!

44:14.763 --> 44:17.281
'The world's full of frustrated
artists,

44:17.283 --> 44:21.283
'yelling out for someone
to notice 'em.

44:23.403 --> 44:27.403
'Hoping for that one moment where
someone recognises their talent.

44:29.883 --> 44:33.883
'Sees something special in them
that nobody's seen before.

44:35.123 --> 44:38.721
'You can wait so long that
you don't even notice the good things

44:38.723 --> 44:42.241
'that are right there
in front of you.

44:42.243 --> 44:45.641
'Folk that maybe can't make you
a star,

44:45.643 --> 44:47.321
'but they've got your back,

44:47.323 --> 44:50.401
'they've seen great things
in you all along.

44:50.403 --> 44:54.403
'Believed in you from the start.

44:59.483 --> 45:03.483
'So I'll keep on going,
till my last bloody breath.

45:06.803 --> 45:09.801
'In the meantime, I'm available.

45:09.803 --> 45:13.803
'For weddings, parties,
bar mitzvahs... You name it.

45:16.523 --> 45:20.523
'Just don't forget
to pack your earplugs.'

45:38.443 --> 45:40.481
- Marry me.
- Put her out of her misery.

45:40.483 --> 45:42.321
It's finding the right moment,
innit?

45:42.323 --> 45:45.081
I'd be crying off sick every week
if I had to do PE in that dump.

45:45.083 --> 45:46.241
'That could be my legacy.'

45:46.243 --> 45:48.201
I could re-build the gym.

45:48.203 --> 45:51.241
It'll take longer than building the
Great Wall of China at this rate...

45:51.243 --> 45:54.241
- Robbing anything like that,
you're going down.
- 'Still got some trackers?'

45:54.243 --> 45:56.081
Jamie and Shane aren't going
to be happy.

45:56.083 --> 45:57.761
Where's the gear? I've got it.

45:57.763 --> 45:59.321
'Two customers taxed in a week...'

45:59.323 --> 46:00.921
It's got to be someone close to home.

46:00.923 --> 46:02.241
What the fuck?!

46:02.243 --> 46:03.856
Whatever it takes to be with you.

46:45.643 --> 46:48.761
I'm out of turps.

46:48.763 --> 46:50.241
Hurry up, then.

46:50.243 --> 46:52.841
I'll be back tomorrow.
I've got homework.

46:52.843 --> 46:56.881
- Looks better though, dunnit?
- How? How is that better?!

46:56.883 --> 46:58.561
Come here, you. We're not finished!

46:58.563 --> 47:01.146
Get back here on your hands
and knees!
