Cousin, if I tell you,
it won't be a surprise‐‐

01:45.839 --> 01:48.709
‐ Balki.
‐ Okay, I give you a hint.

01:48.742 --> 01:53.213
Uh, it's bright green,
it‐it‐it hangs from a tree

It certainly is.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.941

huh?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.577
Yes. Way off.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.878
‐ Isn't he great?
‐ Yes.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.280

‐ Suprides?

02:27.313 --> 02:28.582
‐ Very good.
‐ Oh.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.216

02:32.252 --> 02:33.419
It means dog.

I didn't own half a dog.

I am on my lunch hour

03:20.667 --> 03:22.603
It must have been
his lunch hour too.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.639

to have lunch with him.

Alright,
I'll have the spaghetti.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.682
Okay.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.953
Anyway, uh..

03:39.986 --> 03:41.588
Before I could
ask him to lunch

03:41.622 --> 03:43.524
a man comes up
in a prison truck

03:43.557 --> 03:46.593
and jumps out
and arrests him.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.996
Don't tell me.
You followed them to the pound.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.497
Did I tell you this story?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.400
No, no, you didn't.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.569
Well, I didn't think so.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.438
So, well, I followed them
to the dog prison.

03:58.471 --> 04:01.642
And they, they tell me
that if nobody comes

04:01.675 --> 04:04.444
to claim him,
that he could be ours.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.747
So today, I went back

04:06.780 --> 04:09.415
and nobody claim him,
and they give him to me.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.951
Isn't that wonderful?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.286
And so now he's ours

04:13.319 --> 04:15.321
and he comes
to live here with us.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.458
‐ And we take him to the park.
‐ Wait.

04:18.491 --> 04:21.060
And we teach him
to fetch and catch.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.830
And‐and we teach him
to save children

04:23.864 --> 04:26.299
from the burning building
just like Loussie.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.003

to that part

04:33.840 --> 04:36.309
where he's going
to live here with us.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.978
He's a very nice dog,
but, Balki

04:38.011 --> 04:39.646
I don't see
how we can keep him.

in front of him.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.525

04:55.762 --> 04:57.731

04:58.999 --> 05:00.767
Have you given
any thought at all

05:00.801 --> 05:02.435
to what's involved
in having a dog?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.805
Well, of course I have.
Don't be ridiculous.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.408
Balki, we don't even know
if he's housebroken.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.511

05:10.544 --> 05:12.879
I'm good at that.
I'm a sheepherder.

you can't train a sheep.

the biggest problem.

05:21.454 --> 05:22.956
We can't keep Suprides

05:22.989 --> 05:25.458
because our lease forbids us
to have pets.

‐ Get out of the city.
‐ Yes.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.765

not allow animals?

last tenants for having pets.

to happen to us?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.038

05:43.510 --> 05:45.846

on Mypos called Couscous.

And he grows up with me
and he tends sheep with me.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.686
And before you,
he was my best friend.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.724
And when I came to America

05:57.758 --> 05:59.425
I have to leave him behind.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.928
And now I have a dog again.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.464
Well, Balki,
I know how you feel.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.066
I had a dog back in Madison.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.670
I named him myself.

our front door one winter

nursed him back to health.

Couscous was smart as two whips.

to bring me my sandals.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.964

he used to bring us

06:37.998 --> 06:39.900
each the section we wanted.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.508
When we wanted news..

06:47.541 --> 06:49.776
...Couscous used to drag home
the village gossip.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.184
Spot could read the paper.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.191
Couscous could play
the mandolin.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.663
Spot did my taxes.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.966
‐ Bullwinkle.
‐ Alright, alright.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.635

but he was one

07:14.668 --> 07:16.770

don't you?

No. No!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.161
No, no!

07:43.664 --> 07:46.667
The bottom line
is our lease forbids it.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.902
We'll have
to take him back.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.538
But, cousin, the man
at the dog prison says

07:51.572 --> 07:54.474
that the dogs that
nobody wants are put to sleep.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.184
And if we take him back
this dog is a dead duck.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.046
Now, that's
the spirit of '76.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.017
We'll just do
what mankind has done

11:57.050 --> 11:59.252
for centuries when faced
with a challenge.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.254
We'll adapt.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.156
In a week, this will
all seem second nature.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.793
In a month,
it will be third nature.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.531
Balki...let's take
our dog for a walk.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.498
‐ In the fresh air.
‐ Proudly.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.001
‐ With dignity.
‐ Let's go.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.776
Now, remember
...when we get to the corner

12:22.809 --> 12:25.478
you and Suprides
get in the dumpster

12:25.512 --> 12:27.213
and I'll push you to the park.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.122
[instrumental music]

12:45.398 --> 12:48.502
Baby. Puppy.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.104
Yeah, he wants to go
for his walk, doesn't he?

12:51.137 --> 12:52.238
Yes.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.544
Alright, you deadbeats,
open up.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.547
Come on, Suprides.

13:00.581 --> 13:04.084
Ah, Mr. Twinkacetti,
what, what brings you up here?

13:04.117 --> 13:07.187
‐ You owe me rent. Open up.
‐ He came for the rent.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.055
‐ Didn't you pay it?
‐ No, you pay the rent.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.591
‐ I gave you the check.
‐ No, you didn't.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.326
(Twinkacetti)
'I'm getting
ticked off out here.'

13:13.359 --> 13:16.897
Okay, I'm writing
the check right now.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.431
Just a slight oversight.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.434
Now, that's two T's
in Twinkacetti, isn't it?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.235
[barks]

13:24.571 --> 13:26.573
Okay, here we go. Yes.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.474
Here's the check.
I'm sorry I can't ask you in.

13:28.509 --> 13:31.177
I'm contagious.
I have rickets.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.948
What you got is a dog in here.
I heard it.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.449
We don't have a dog.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.019
That's against
our leash. Lease.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.094
Then what are you doing
with this?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.564
‐ That's mine.
‐ Yours? You eat that?

13:50.597 --> 13:52.933
Oh, yes.
Very nutritious.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.036
No additives,
no preservatives.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.604
Chock‐full of vitamins.

13:57.638 --> 14:00.440
Yeah. You should eat this well.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.442
Why don't you have
a snack right now?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.217
Mmm.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.287
This is delicious.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.323
And if you're a gravy lover,
you just add water.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.373
Mr. Twinkacetti,
you catch me unawares.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.280
Cousin, guests?
Why you didn't tell me?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.250
I was just telling
Mr. Twinkacetti

14:44.284 --> 14:46.086
about our nutrition program.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.521
Balki turned me on to this.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.291
‐ What?
‐ Nothing.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.027
I'm just explaining to
Mr. Twinkacetti

14:54.060 --> 14:57.097
why we have dog food
in the house but no dog.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.533
Mmm? Hmm? Yes.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.475
Would you care
to join us for dinner?

15:09.510 --> 15:10.677
It's nothing fancy.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.480
Ah‐ha!

15:14.515 --> 15:16.983
‐ Dog hair.
‐ Dog hair?

15:17.017 --> 15:20.086
Ah, ah, ha, ha.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.623
Balki, he thinks
that's dog hair.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.324
[laughs]

15:32.599 --> 15:37.237
We were entertaining a couple
of young ladies last night.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.371
They shed.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.510
Norwegian.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.313
Oh, please.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.419
‐ What's in the bedroom?
‐ Nothing.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.722
‐ My girlfriend.
‐ Nothing but his girlfriend.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.292
Inga.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.668
Mr. Twinkacetti, you have
no right to invade our privacy.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.604
You can't just barge in here
and search our apartment.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.139
I have every right.
I'm the landlord.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.474
Well, we're the tenants
and we have..

16:14.508 --> 16:18.144
On the other hand,
why beat a dead dog?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.013
Search to your
heart's contempt.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.447
Be our guest.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.993
Why did you make
me eat dog food?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.163
I had to.
Why are you wearing my clothes?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.498
Don't change the subject.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.667
Why are you wearing
my clothes..

16:40.701 --> 16:42.268
(in unison)
Hi.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.306
Your girlfriend seems
to have disappeared.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.808
Well, she's very shy.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.077
She probably
jumped out the window.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.347
Guys, guys, I know
you got a dog in here.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.816
And when I find it,
you either get

16:55.849 --> 16:58.484
it out of here
or you're out of here.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.353
Seems fair.

17:02.823 --> 17:05.626
Thank you so much
for dropping by.

17:05.659 --> 17:07.327
How did Suprides
get out of the bedroom?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.194
Well, he opened the door.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.798
But I know that.
How did he open the door?

17:11.832 --> 17:14.034
I taught him how
to do it with his teeth.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.704
Well, unless you taught him
how to hail a cab

17:17.738 --> 17:19.472
I suggest we go get him.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.314
Get rid of Inga.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.785
[instrumental music]

17:40.460 --> 17:42.663
Don't worry, Suprides.

17:42.696 --> 17:45.398
I don't let Mr. Twinkacetti
take you away.

17:45.431 --> 17:46.767
I'll think of something.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.403
Do you have any ideas?

17:51.437 --> 17:52.438
Me neither.

17:56.610 --> 17:59.846
Balki, how you doing?

17:59.880 --> 18:01.447
Cousin, I can't
talk right now.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.551
I have to think
of a way to keep Suprides.

18:04.585 --> 18:08.188
Balki, Mr. Twinkacetti said
Suprides had to be out by today.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.856
Cousin, we have till midnight.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.260
Well, I think
I came up with something.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.863
I went to an organization
that finds homes for animals.

18:18.632 --> 18:22.235
Cousin, I told you,
I don't want you to do that.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.871
Well, I think I found
the right family for Suprides.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.840
You'll like the Coopers.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.543
Cousin, how can you
think of sending

18:29.576 --> 18:31.545
Suprides to a family
you don't even know?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.647
I've talked to the Coopers
for a long time.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.481
They took me out
to their place.

18:35.516 --> 18:39.485
It's a farm with trees
and meadows and a brook.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.623
And they've got two kids
who are just dying for a dog.

18:42.656 --> 18:46.192
And they're right downstairs.
Why don't you just meet them?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.161
No, I don't want to meet them.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.899
Balki, I don't think
living in an apartment

18:52.933 --> 18:55.502
is good for Suprides.

18:55.536 --> 18:58.438
He's cooped up all day.
He can't get out.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.508
He can't meet other dogs.
He can't date.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.879
But we don't date
and we're okay.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.486
No?

19:13.520 --> 19:16.890
Balki, forcing a dog
to live like us is inhuman.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.295
I think he'll be
happier on a farm.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.700
How could he be
happy without me?

19:28.669 --> 19:32.372
Balki, I know this
is painful for you.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.240
But I think maybe
you're thinking more

19:34.274 --> 19:36.577
about what's good for you
than what's good for him.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.516
They have a farm?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.518
‐ With sheep.
‐ Sheep?

19:46.019 --> 19:48.321
I think Suprides
would like sheep.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.391
Can I get the Coopers?

19:52.526 --> 19:54.194
Yes.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.733
[door opens]

20:03.970 --> 20:06.740
Did you hear that, Suprides?

20:06.773 --> 20:09.442
Cousin Larry
has found you a new home.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.878
And he says you'll like it.

20:11.912 --> 20:14.748
And Cousin Larry don't lie.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.317
He says it's got
a lot of trees

20:17.350 --> 20:20.887
and a meadow,
and a brook

20:20.921 --> 20:23.924
and a lot
of children to play with

20:23.957 --> 20:26.560
and some sheep to chase

20:26.593 --> 20:28.662
just like Couscous
does on Mypos.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.064
[dramatic music]

20:34.935 --> 20:37.871
I don't want you to go.

20:37.904 --> 20:42.509
But...I didn't rescue you
from the prison truck

20:42.543 --> 20:45.746
to keep you locked
in an apartment all day.

20:45.779 --> 20:49.616
And I'll come to see you
so you don't forget me.

20:49.650 --> 20:54.888
And maybe someday, I have a farm
and you can come to visit me

20:54.921 --> 20:58.659
and run in my fields
and play with me

20:58.692 --> 21:02.763
and nobody takes you away
from me...ever again.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.534
So if you like the Coopers

21:07.568 --> 21:11.638
and you want to go to
their farm and wait for me

21:11.672 --> 21:14.508
then show me something.

21:14.541 --> 21:18.044
Show me a sign
and then I'll be okay.

21:28.722 --> 21:32.559
Oh, look.
What a beautiful dog.

21:32.593 --> 21:34.327
Balki, this is Mrs. Cooper.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.529
‐ Hello, Balki.
‐ Hello.

21:37.598 --> 21:40.100
‐ Can we pet the dog?
‐ Of course you can.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.602
‐ Here, boy.
‐ Here, boy.

21:44.538 --> 21:46.607
Well, Suprides
seems to like the kids.

21:48.809 --> 21:50.343
Can we keep him, mom?

21:50.376 --> 21:52.613
He's the neatest dog
in the whole world.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.851
Can we, please?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.625
Well, Balki, it's up to you.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.599
Well, that's up to Suprides.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.035
Suprides, what do you say?

22:29.015 --> 22:31.718
He says yes,
so I say yes.

22:31.752 --> 22:34.020
Oh, thank you.

22:34.054 --> 22:36.489
You're welcome.

22:36.523 --> 22:40.093
Now, you take
good care of him.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.863
He likes to be
scratched right here.

22:42.896 --> 22:45.498
And, uh..

22:45.532 --> 22:48.001
He likes sour cream
and onion potato chips.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.772
We'll take good care of him.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.907
And you can come visit him
any time you want.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.408
Thank you.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.079
Bye‐bye, Suprides.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.150
‐ Come on, kids. Let's go.
‐ Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

23:04.184 --> 23:05.619
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thanks.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.121
‐ Alright, come on, come on.
‐ Goodbye.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.072
I feel bad.

23:27.808 --> 23:30.877
Well, I'm sorry we had
to give up Suprides, too.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.679
No.

23:32.713 --> 23:36.082
I feel bad because
...I'm a selfish person.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.621
No, you're not.

23:40.654 --> 23:43.924
When you realized what was
best for Suprides, you did it.

23:43.957 --> 23:46.492
I'm proud of you.

23:46.527 --> 23:48.829
‐ You are?
‐ 'You bet I am.'

23:48.862 --> 23:51.698
Well, then, I feel better.

23:51.732 --> 23:56.036
Cousin, someday can we have,
can we have a little pet?

23:56.069 --> 23:58.505
Well, sure, I guess
we could get something like

23:58.539 --> 24:01.975
a...hamster or a fish.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.811
I want a fish.

24:04.845 --> 24:07.213
Well, alright, one of these days
we'll go to the pet store‐‐

24:07.247 --> 24:09.015
‐ No, I want go today.
‐ No.

24:09.049 --> 24:10.951
‐ I want go today.
‐ We can't go today.

24:10.984 --> 24:12.886
No, no, Balki.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.457
‐ Alright, alright.
‐ Okay.

24:19.693 --> 24:22.128
We'll go today.
We'll get one fish.

24:23.864 --> 24:25.532
And I get to name it.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.771
Well, cousin, it's just the one
fish, he's going to get lonely.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.973
Two fish, that's it.

24:33.006 --> 24:35.709
And you clean the bowl.

24:35.742 --> 24:38.579
Can we get the little diver
with the bubbles?

24:38.612 --> 24:40.547
No, we can't get the little
diver with the bubbles.

24:40.581 --> 24:42.783
Can we get that,
that sticky stuff that..

24:42.816 --> 24:43.817
No, you can't.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.855
