02:18.780 --> 02:19.723
Bonjour, madame.

02:19.823 --> 02:22.042
Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.

02:24.995 --> 02:26.396
Vive l'Amerique.

02:26.496 --> 02:27.814
Vive la France.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.441
Vive le President Roosevelt.

02:29.541 --> 02:31.168
Vive Le General de Gaulle.

02:32.002 --> 02:34.425
Vive le Radio City Music Hall.

02:35.881 --> 02:37.724
Vive Les Folies Bergere.

03:07.662 --> 03:10.273
First time I saw him,
we'd stopped off in a little town

03:10.373 --> 03:12.401
in the mountains of Southern France.

03:12.501 --> 03:15.570
Up north, at the time,
they were liberating Paris.

03:15.670 --> 03:18.139
That was the big war, the glamour war.

03:18.298 --> 03:22.577
The one they were taking all the pictures
of and writing all the words about.

03:22.677 --> 03:24.663
But we had our own war,

03:24.763 --> 03:28.233
And they weren't writing many words
or taking many pictures.

03:29.184 --> 03:31.128
We'd landed near Saint-Tropez.

03:31.228 --> 03:33.902
There wasn't much
resistance on the beaches,

03:34.022 --> 03:36.967
not at all like the day
we got to Sicily or Salerno, or...

03:37.067 --> 03:39.320
Oh, yeah, Anzio.

03:40.403 --> 03:43.807
We started north, and once in a while
the Germans loped over an 88,

03:43.907 --> 03:45.705
and once in a while somebody was killed.

03:46.910 --> 03:49.004
Sometimes it was a friend.

03:59.923 --> 04:01.616
He was one of a truckload of replacements,

04:01.716 --> 04:04.369
and at ﬁrst they looked
like any bunch of new guys...

04:04.469 --> 04:06.972
Too young, too clean and too polished.

04:07.222 --> 04:09.224
And they all looked scared...

04:10.725 --> 04:12.318
Except him.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.004
He wasn't scared.

04:14.104 --> 04:16.380
He was the kind of a guy you'd notice.

04:16.481 --> 04:18.341
You know, take any group of guys,

04:18.440 --> 04:20.177
there's always one that stands out.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.083
Attention!

04:28.243 --> 04:30.353
Any of you guys know
how to operate a radio?

04:30.453 --> 04:32.205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

04:32.789 --> 04:35.588
Okay, the rest of you guys
can knock it off.

04:39.838 --> 04:40.864
What's your name, soldier?

04:40.964 --> 04:43.467
Technician 5th grade Britt Harris, sir.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.036
Let's see your Form 20.

04:46.136 --> 04:47.353
Yes, sir.

04:56.688 --> 04:57.860
Uh-huh.

04:58.356 --> 05:01.301
Graduate of Culver Military Academy,
attended Virginia Military Institute,

05:01.401 --> 05:03.887
Penn State, Colgate and Cornell.

05:03.987 --> 05:06.723
I never met a guy who
went to four colleges before.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.951
How come you're not an officer?

05:09.451 --> 05:12.187
Uh, it's rather difficult to explain, sir.

05:12.287 --> 05:13.334
Try.

05:15.165 --> 05:17.543
I wanted to serve with the men, sir.

05:18.376 --> 05:20.799
Would you like to try that again?

05:22.631 --> 05:26.451
Well, there are a few people
I wanted to prove a few things to, sir.

05:26.551 --> 05:28.662
You got anxious a little late.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.706
You been in the Army eight months,
we've been overseas 20 months.

05:31.806 --> 05:34.355
I was deferred, sir, because of my job.

05:34.684 --> 05:38.780
Yeah, "General Manager of the Harris
Woolen Mills, Newark, New Jersey."

05:39.022 --> 05:41.633
You're named Harris and the mill's
named Harris. Coincidence, huh?

05:41.733 --> 05:43.531
My father, sir.

05:44.653 --> 05:46.304
That's pretty smart
of you to pick an old man

05:46.404 --> 05:48.056
who owns a textile mill.

05:48.156 --> 05:49.533
Only one?

05:50.700 --> 05:52.043
Four, sir.

05:53.828 --> 05:55.480
My old man was in business, too.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.274
Ran a little candy store in New York.

05:57.374 --> 05:59.609
123rd Street, near 8th Avenue.

05:59.709 --> 06:04.431
He used to ask me to help him out once
in a while when he had a run on bubble gum.

06:05.048 --> 06:08.302
You run that radio right,
and we'll get along fine.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.434
If you don't, I'll boot your tail up
around your neck.

06:11.554 --> 06:12.539
Comprenez?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.640
Yes, sir.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.544
Wait around here and I'll check you in
with the room clerk.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.046
Does the, uh, Lieutenant
wish me to carry these, sir?

06:20.146 --> 06:23.491
The Lieutenant wishes for you to knock off
that stateside chicken!

06:25.151 --> 06:27.279
I needed someone to do Wiley's job.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.082
He was one of the men
we left behind on the beach.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.272
All right, dream boy, up and at 'em!

06:37.372 --> 06:38.982
Come on, I got a new radio operator.

06:39.082 --> 06:40.025
Check him in.

06:41.209 --> 06:42.152
The artillery makes the replacements.

06:42.252 --> 06:43.629
Why don't you let the artillery
make the repl...

06:43.753 --> 06:45.155
They make 'em. Why don't you let them?

06:45.255 --> 06:46.740
I mean, you know how the old man...

06:46.840 --> 06:49.492
Shut your big, fat mouth
and grab a pencil. Come on!

06:51.720 --> 06:53.246
That's not a nice way to talk,
you know that.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.707
Not a nice way to talk for someone
who was just made an officer

06:55.807 --> 06:57.684
and a gentleman, sir.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.443
This guy's from Newark, too.
Do you know him?

07:03.690 --> 07:04.691
Ho, ho.

07:05.066 --> 07:08.553
No, I... Well, we're not exactly
buddy-buddies, but I know about him.

07:08.653 --> 07:10.680
Yes, sir, "Corporal Britt Harris.

07:10.780 --> 07:14.059
"Army serial no. 33170247."

07:14.159 --> 07:16.853
You've got yourself a real doozy
this time, Lieutenant.

07:16.953 --> 07:19.105
Would you like to explain that, Corporal?

07:19.205 --> 07:20.231
You mean a "doozy"?

07:20.331 --> 07:21.316
Mm-hmm.

07:21.416 --> 07:24.361
Well, a doozy,
in this case, is a celebrity.

07:24.461 --> 07:28.031
I mean, Mr. Britt Harris was quite
a celebrity up around our way.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.383
It seems

07:29.674 --> 07:32.410
that a member of the draft board,
of Harris' draft board,

07:32.510 --> 07:36.765
just happened to be working in a factory
that Harris just happened to be running.

07:37.348 --> 07:39.793
He tried to bribe him,
he gave him a Chevrolet.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.169
I would've held out for a Cadillac.

07:41.269 --> 07:42.612
Naturally.

07:42.812 --> 07:44.381
What then... What happened then?

07:44.481 --> 07:46.950
Well, he had to enlist. In a hurry.

07:48.610 --> 07:49.611
Huh.

07:49.944 --> 07:51.012
Thanks, Corporal.

07:51.112 --> 07:52.472
You're welcome.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.557
Oh, uh... Corporal,

07:54.657 --> 07:56.977
you will keep this to yourself, won't you?

07:57.077 --> 08:00.422
Tear out the fingernails, sir.
Tear out the fingernails.

08:01.706 --> 08:04.676
And a very sanitary measure
it would be, too.

08:05.043 --> 08:08.468
Don't worry about me, Sam, Lieutenant, sir.
You know me, sir.

08:08.963 --> 08:09.906
Big mouth!

08:10.006 --> 08:12.575
Je parle le francais un petit peu,
but I'd like to borrow your eggs.

08:12.675 --> 08:13.676
Oh!

08:13.802 --> 08:14.744
Les oeufs, monsieur?

08:14.844 --> 08:17.247
Yeah, I'll take one, two...

08:17.347 --> 08:18.348
Yes.

08:23.895 --> 08:26.423
I never told him I knew,
but I kept an eye on him.

08:26.523 --> 08:28.341
You see, in our outﬁt we had to get along.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.260
We were a forward observation team.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.658
We lived in each other's pockets.

08:36.658 --> 08:37.659
Oh.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.206
Hey, Harris.

08:41.663 --> 08:43.039
Bye-bye.

08:49.379 --> 08:50.363
What are those?

08:50.463 --> 08:51.573
Les oeufs.

08:51.673 --> 08:53.199
Did you pay for them?

08:53.299 --> 08:55.410
No, sir. That woman gave them to me.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.557
Why?

08:57.554 --> 09:00.774
I don't know why, sir,
but women are always giving me things.

09:03.059 --> 09:05.232
Let me see now, that'll be one for Rogers,

09:06.187 --> 09:08.214
one for Harmer,

09:08.314 --> 09:10.383
one for Breglio,

09:10.483 --> 09:11.885
and one for...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.428
No, two for me.

09:13.528 --> 09:15.722
I keep forgetting I'm an officer now.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.183
Yeah, that about leaves
one for you, right?

09:18.283 --> 09:19.455
Right.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.147
I guess I gave him
a rough time, all right.

09:24.247 --> 09:25.774
Partly because I didn't trust him,

09:25.874 --> 09:28.878
and partly because he was
born rich and handsome,

09:29.085 --> 09:31.838
and I was born poor and not handsome.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.268
You guys met Harris yet?

09:37.427 --> 09:38.369
Uh-huh.

09:38.469 --> 09:39.595
Yeah.

09:41.598 --> 09:44.647
I understand he got sort of held up
getting in the army.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.980
We had a couple of dry runs today.
He's pretty good with a radio.

09:49.647 --> 09:50.924
So was Wiley.

09:53.902 --> 09:55.449
Land mines!

09:56.738 --> 09:57.910
Land mines!

09:59.490 --> 10:02.118
Get the medics up here on the double!

10:03.119 --> 10:05.438
It's those replacements.
They went into that other orchard.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.649
I thought everybody knew
that place was loaded with mines!

10:07.749 --> 10:09.843
It was marked! I know it was marked!

10:09.959 --> 10:11.802
Shut up, you guys! Shut up.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.739
My God, Mama! Oh, my God, Mama!

10:14.839 --> 10:17.992
Everybody knew it was mined.
Everybody should've known it was mined!

10:18.092 --> 10:19.469
You men in there,

10:19.928 --> 10:22.497
don't move an inch,
you'll touch off some more mines!

10:22.597 --> 10:24.065
Stay right where you are!

10:24.933 --> 10:26.709
Oh, God, Mama!

10:26.809 --> 10:30.151
Get the P and A men up here on the double.
Tell 'em to bring their detectors.

10:30.355 --> 10:31.948
Oh, God, Mama!

10:34.192 --> 10:35.865
Oh, God, Mama!

10:36.486 --> 10:39.160
Oh, God, Mama!

10:39.530 --> 10:41.282
Oh, God, Mama!

10:42.492 --> 10:43.476
Oh, God, Mama!

10:43.576 --> 10:45.453
You, stop! Hold it there!

10:45.870 --> 10:48.464
Don't move, you'll touch off more mines!

10:48.957 --> 10:51.460
They're all in here in close order.

10:51.626 --> 10:54.596
Tell the medics to take
a bearing on my clothes.

11:07.350 --> 11:11.355
One was dead, two had lost legs,
ﬁve were hospital cases.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.695
You're quite a guy, Corporal.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.038
Yes, sir, a real live hero.

11:23.074 --> 11:27.458
You want me to pin the medal on you now,
or you wanna wait for the General to do it?

11:28.830 --> 11:31.379
Well, I figured speed was essential, sir.

11:31.666 --> 11:34.110
You ever hear of a little gadget
called a mine detector?

11:34.210 --> 11:35.278
Answer me.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.362
Yes, sir.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.073
Didn't you hear me holler for you
to stop when you went in there?

11:39.173 --> 11:40.283
Oh, no, sir.

11:40.383 --> 11:41.885
That's too bad.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.956
You got a razor blade in your gear?

11:47.056 --> 11:48.082
Yes, sir.

11:48.182 --> 11:49.834
Then use it to cut off your stripes,

11:49.934 --> 11:51.561
Private Harris.

12:01.612 --> 12:02.597
'Morning, sir.

12:02.697 --> 12:03.723
'Morning, Sam.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.417
Find yourself a place to sit.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.984
I'm, uh, not going to try to persuade you

12:15.084 --> 12:17.257
not to yank this man's stripes,

12:17.378 --> 12:20.281
but I thought maybe you'd fill me in
on just what happened.

12:20.381 --> 12:21.658
Nothing much happened, Colonel.

12:21.758 --> 12:26.309
It's just that I hollered at him to stop
and he didn't obey orders. That's all.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.730
I can recall a couple times
when you didn't hear an order.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.504
I wouldn't have gone in there. Would you?

12:34.604 --> 12:36.777
You kiddin'? We got too much sense.

12:36.981 --> 12:38.107
Yeah.

12:38.232 --> 12:40.530
You know, I can't quite figure this kid.

12:41.903 --> 12:44.247
Maybe you don't have to. No, thanks.

12:45.281 --> 12:47.183
Sam, don't ride the man so hard.

12:47.283 --> 12:49.911
He can't help that he went to college.

12:50.453 --> 12:52.563
I was going to put him up for a citation.

12:52.663 --> 12:53.648
Oh, don't worry.

12:53.748 --> 12:56.693
You'll get plenty of chances
to give this guy a medal.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.010
Sam, um...

13:00.296 --> 13:02.699
How many days have
you and your men been under fire?

13:02.799 --> 13:03.783
Altogether?

13:03.883 --> 13:04.993
Yeah, altogether.

13:05.093 --> 13:06.436
188, 89.

13:08.471 --> 13:10.581
You familiar with the French Riviera?

13:10.681 --> 13:12.649
Only what I've read in
the National Geographic.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.878
Well, I'm told that, um...

13:15.978 --> 13:19.048
Big hotels are fixed so that
you turn on a water faucet

13:19.148 --> 13:21.301
and you get either Cognac or Champagne.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.969
Now that, uh, probably isn't true,

13:23.069 --> 13:27.015
but suppose you and your men go down
there and make a 24-hour investigation.

13:27.115 --> 13:28.662
Yes, sir.

13:32.703 --> 13:34.330
An hour later we were halfway to Nice.

13:34.622 --> 13:36.482
That's the kind of a war it was.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.210
Some people call it
the Champagne Campaign.

13:46.509 --> 13:48.036
Nobody who was there will ever forget

13:48.136 --> 13:50.184
the way the French Riviera
was that season.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.899
The Army had made it a rest area.

13:53.182 --> 13:56.686
There'd never been one like it
before and never would be again.

13:58.688 --> 14:00.631
They shipped in oranges from North Africa,

14:00.731 --> 14:02.733
eggs from Sweden, steaks from Argentina.

14:03.526 --> 14:06.325
The Champagne and Cognac
were already there...

14:07.655 --> 14:09.766
So were some of the girls,

14:09.866 --> 14:13.086
but others came by bus,
by foot and by plane.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.959
Oh, there were all kinds of girls.

14:20.543 --> 14:22.028
The hotels were luxurious, all right,

14:22.128 --> 14:24.381
but it wasn't quite like the Colonel said.

14:24.922 --> 14:26.741
You had to go all the way
out to the terrace

14:26.841 --> 14:29.094
to get the Cognac and the Champagne.

14:32.013 --> 14:35.142
You can forget how beautiful
a beautiful woman can be,

14:37.268 --> 14:40.192
but it doesn't take long
to refresh your memory.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.739
I saw what they meant
by the French Riviera.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.723
After a few hours, I got tired

15:32.823 --> 15:36.060
of looking at 10,000 other men
wearing the same suit I was

15:36.160 --> 15:37.812
and doing the same things I was.

15:37.912 --> 15:41.291
I left the guys at a bistro
and just took off in the jeep.

15:50.132 --> 15:51.242
Bienvenue, Americain!

15:51.342 --> 15:52.368
Bravo, les Americains!

15:52.468 --> 15:53.494
Ah!

15:53.594 --> 15:55.204
Bienvenue, les Americains. Bienvenue!

15:55.304 --> 15:56.977
Soyez bienvenu!

16:06.482 --> 16:09.986
You are the first American I have seen.

16:11.654 --> 16:12.680
I have been thinking

16:12.780 --> 16:15.558
that I must give something
to my first American...

16:15.658 --> 16:17.752
Something I like very much.

16:41.809 --> 16:43.252
Four...

16:43.352 --> 16:45.354
Cinq, five...

16:46.731 --> 16:49.735
Six, six...

16:50.318 --> 16:52.595
Sept, huit... Sept...

16:52.695 --> 16:54.368
- Sev... Sev...
- Sept...

16:54.780 --> 16:56.349
- Sept, seven...
- Seven...

16:56.449 --> 16:59.623
I try now to remember
what I thought in that ﬁrst moment...

16:59.744 --> 17:01.354
That she was beautiful, I guess.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.855
Quatre, four...

17:02.955 --> 17:05.273
That I wanted very much to speak to her.

17:05.374 --> 17:07.047
- Cinq...
- Cinq, five...

17:08.711 --> 17:10.554
Six, six...

17:11.380 --> 17:13.053
Sept, seven...

17:16.260 --> 17:17.261
Huit.

17:19.012 --> 17:20.515
Oh, non, non, non.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.965
Uh, mademoiselle, um...

17:29.065 --> 17:31.443
Je suis American.

17:32.276 --> 17:34.574
Uh, yes, I know.

17:35.738 --> 17:37.365
You speak English.

17:37.698 --> 17:40.793
My mother sometimes says
I speak it perpetually.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.402
Lieutenant Sam Loggins.

17:53.089 --> 17:54.090
Oh...

18:04.266 --> 18:05.939
I don't understand.

18:07.311 --> 18:10.064
He does not know you mean him to keep it.

18:10.564 --> 18:12.925
He has never had a gift before, I think.

18:19.115 --> 18:22.460
Uh, Lieutenant Sam Loggins,
Jean-Francois Duvan.

18:25.121 --> 18:26.873
Merci bien, monsieur.

18:27.289 --> 18:28.711
You're welcome.

18:33.129 --> 18:35.281
And now I must go. I am very late.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.099
Thank you again and goodbye.

18:37.425 --> 18:39.848
I know Jean-Francois' name,
but I don't know yours.

18:40.594 --> 18:42.705
Oh, I am Monique Blair.

18:42.805 --> 18:44.728
Your English is very good.

18:45.015 --> 18:46.834
I am an American.

18:46.934 --> 18:49.938
You're kidding!
Then why do you talk like that?

18:50.312 --> 18:53.316
Well, I was born in Paris.
I have always lived in France.

18:54.275 --> 18:57.678
And you've never been home...
Uh, to the United States, I mean?

18:57.778 --> 18:59.451
France is my home.

19:15.671 --> 19:18.824
Miss, whatever it is she's
cooking in there smells awful good.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.368
What do you call it?

19:20.468 --> 19:22.186
Poulpe.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.439
It... It tastes very good, too.

19:28.184 --> 19:30.653
Uh, come, I...
I will introduce you to the madame.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.673
Ah, bonjour!

19:33.773 --> 19:34.799
Bonjour.

19:45.326 --> 19:46.919
That looks good.

19:48.704 --> 19:50.672
Mmm, that's wonderful.

19:51.207 --> 19:52.566
What do they call this?

19:52.666 --> 19:54.418
Uh, uh... Poulpe.

19:54.835 --> 19:56.428
What's it mean?

19:57.338 --> 19:58.715
Octopus.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.370
My father felt the same way.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.871
He loved poulpe.

20:05.971 --> 20:06.956
Very nice.

20:08.557 --> 20:10.626
Can't you recommend something else?

20:10.726 --> 20:13.855
Uh... The small sardines,
fried crisp in butter.

20:14.563 --> 20:16.110
Could you, uh...

20:16.941 --> 20:18.300
Could you stay and...

20:18.400 --> 20:19.993
Have some with me?

20:20.611 --> 20:21.988
Please?

20:35.042 --> 20:36.635
Thank you, ma'am.

20:38.921 --> 20:40.990
Does she give Brandy
to everybody on the house?

20:41.090 --> 20:43.159
Madame is French.

20:43.259 --> 20:45.853
It is unlikely that she
has ever done so before,

20:45.970 --> 20:48.064
or that she ever will again.

20:48.597 --> 20:49.598
Now...

20:50.057 --> 20:53.311
Tell me what happened
after your father died.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.615
Well, I hung around New York for a while,

20:59.275 --> 21:01.343
then I realized that
all the guys I grew up with

21:01.443 --> 21:03.787
were either drafted or in jail.

21:04.446 --> 21:06.574
So I went back to Los Angeles.

21:07.199 --> 21:10.169
Then one day, Mr. Bolling called me
in his office and he said, uh...

21:10.286 --> 21:13.130
"Sam, take a look at the new letterheads."

21:13.289 --> 21:15.691
So I looked at them and I said,
"They look fine."

21:15.791 --> 21:17.418
And then I saw it.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.760
The letterhead said,
"Bolling and Loggins, Constructionists."

21:22.631 --> 21:25.134
He made me a partner just like that.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.387
And what did you do then?

21:28.888 --> 21:30.481
Well, I thanked him.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.211
You thanked him,

21:35.311 --> 21:37.405
making your voice very deep,

21:38.188 --> 21:39.485
then you

21:39.690 --> 21:41.033
excused yourself,

21:41.650 --> 21:43.948
and you went into your own office,

21:44.278 --> 21:45.825
closed the door,

21:47.281 --> 21:48.954
and you wept.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.393
You wept because

21:51.493 --> 21:54.271
Mr. Fred Bolling is such a good man.

21:54.371 --> 21:56.419
Well, to tell you the truth,

21:57.708 --> 22:01.338
I never mentioned this before,
but that's exactly what I did.

22:01.462 --> 22:02.554
I wept.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.846
How did you guess that?

22:06.050 --> 22:07.552
Oh, I did not guess.

22:07.676 --> 22:08.802
I think

22:09.011 --> 22:10.308
Americans are

22:10.596 --> 22:12.894
ashamed when they feel tenderness.

22:13.849 --> 22:15.977
You know, my father once told me...

22:16.185 --> 22:18.045
"Monique, you cannot judge a man,

22:18.145 --> 22:19.692
"by what he says

22:20.064 --> 22:21.987
"unless you see his face."

22:23.525 --> 22:25.027
Your father was a very wise man.

22:25.361 --> 22:26.387
Oh, yes,

22:26.487 --> 22:27.471
he was,

22:27.571 --> 22:29.539
very wise indeed.

22:38.749 --> 22:40.296
What'd she say?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.590
Uh, oh, ah...

22:42.878 --> 22:43.925
She said that

22:44.088 --> 22:46.557
she loved having the Americans here.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.492
Thank you.

22:56.183 --> 22:58.356
Uh, she wishes you

22:58.852 --> 23:01.025
very much good luck.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.758
For me, it will be very bad luck
unless I go home now.

23:04.858 --> 23:06.326
My mother will worry.

23:11.198 --> 23:12.224
Think I could see you again?

23:12.324 --> 23:14.747
I can get another pass next weekend.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.337
I cannot see you again.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.753
You cannot or you will not?

23:20.290 --> 23:21.587
Will not.

23:24.128 --> 23:26.426
Well, I guess that wraps it up then.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.262
I like you, Sam.

23:33.595 --> 23:36.189
I think you are a very good American.

23:36.765 --> 23:38.608
But you won't see me again.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.443
I won't see you again.

23:43.063 --> 23:46.008
Well, I don't usually
press my luck, but, uh,

23:46.108 --> 23:47.551
if you change your mind,

23:47.651 --> 23:50.450
around 8:00 next Saturday night,
I'll be here.

23:50.904 --> 23:52.056
Goodbye, Sam.

23:52.156 --> 23:53.703
And thank you again.

24:52.508 --> 24:55.102
When we got back,
it was still the same old war.

24:55.844 --> 24:59.206
It was funny. Some days we drank
Champagne, courtesy of the French,

24:59.306 --> 25:02.526
and some days we ate dirt,
courtesy of the Germans.

25:04.353 --> 25:06.255
Our objective that morning was a ridge

25:06.355 --> 25:08.278
that overlooked a valley
held by the Germans.

25:09.233 --> 25:12.678
The valley was only ﬁve kilometers
from the pass leading into Italy,

25:12.778 --> 25:15.372
but it was a very valuable
piece of real estate.

25:19.034 --> 25:21.353
Intelligence ﬁgured the Jerries
had moved off the ridge,

25:21.453 --> 25:23.501
but intelligence couldn't be sure.

25:24.414 --> 25:26.792
So it was our job to ﬁnd out.

26:16.216 --> 26:18.827
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

26:18.927 --> 26:19.928
Fire mission. Over.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.190
You got 'em?

26:24.266 --> 26:25.518
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

26:26.393 --> 26:27.836
From Checkpoint 8.

26:27.936 --> 26:29.671
From Checkpoint 8.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.068
Azimuth 4000.

26:31.398 --> 26:32.991
Azimuth 4000.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.619
Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

26:36.403 --> 26:38.781
Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

26:39.072 --> 26:41.416
A concrete bunker. Fire for effect.

26:41.617 --> 26:42.789
Concrete bunker.

26:43.118 --> 26:45.120
Fire for effect. Over.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.714
Here they come.

26:58.258 --> 26:59.201
Duck!

27:15.317 --> 27:16.910
Okay, that's it.

27:17.444 --> 27:19.697
End of mission. Area covered. Out.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.499
There goes our radio.
We're gonna have to wait for support.

27:48.684 --> 27:49.685
Duck!

27:52.938 --> 27:54.756
Then they started paying us back.

27:54.856 --> 27:56.733
We couldn't move in any direction.

27:57.025 --> 27:58.760
We were locked in.

28:01.863 --> 28:03.740
They got guns, too.

28:05.993 --> 28:08.542
I ﬁgured maybe we had ﬁve minutes to live,

28:08.829 --> 28:10.627
give or take a little.

28:55.876 --> 28:58.004
You're quite a guy, Harris.

28:58.754 --> 29:00.756
Pretty fancy dancin'.

29:02.758 --> 29:05.452
You like your stripes back,
I'll get 'em back for you.

29:05.552 --> 29:06.895
Thanks.

29:07.637 --> 29:10.916
Next time we're on a pass together,
I'll buy you a beer.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.768
Thanks, Lieutenant.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.608
It's nothing, Sergeant.

29:18.940 --> 29:21.034
That night, we took over the bunker,

29:21.943 --> 29:24.787
we started to zero in
on the valley with our howitzers.

29:25.989 --> 29:28.117
We blasted them whenever we saw them.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.544
But the thing is,
we almost never saw them.

29:48.470 --> 29:49.813
Peek-a-boo.

29:53.642 --> 29:54.626
Hi, Lieutenant.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.170
I'm your new radio operator.
Anderson, Roy.

29:57.270 --> 29:58.613
Hey, Britt.

29:58.855 --> 29:59.856
Hi.

30:00.482 --> 30:01.984
You guys know each other?

30:02.150 --> 30:05.929
Sure. We just about got our tails
blown off together. Didn't we, Britt?

30:06.029 --> 30:07.014
Yeah.

30:07.114 --> 30:08.140
How's that?

30:08.240 --> 30:09.742
We're in the same bunch of replacements.

30:10.325 --> 30:13.895
Remember that night all those guys went
into that minefield and got blown to hell?

30:13.995 --> 30:17.750
Me and old Britt were in there
getting a helmet full of apples.

30:19.459 --> 30:21.945
Okay, Anderson, get on over to the billet.

30:22.045 --> 30:24.281
Rustle yourself up a spot to lie down in.

30:24.381 --> 30:25.741
Right you are, Lieutenant.

30:25.841 --> 30:27.684
Take it easy, Britt.

30:35.851 --> 30:37.774
So you'd already explored
the orchard, huh?

30:38.687 --> 30:41.006
You knew pretty much where the mines were.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.858
Uh, well, I wasn't sure.

30:43.733 --> 30:47.909
I figured you wouldn't pull a bonehead trick
like that without an angle.

30:48.530 --> 30:52.251
If you'd told me about it,
I wouldn't have yanked your stripes.

30:53.785 --> 30:57.380
But then I guess nobody
would have thought of you as a hero.

30:57.581 --> 30:58.582
Did somebody?

31:00.750 --> 31:02.252
You know something?

31:03.044 --> 31:05.489
I can't figure you.
Every time I think I've got you zeroed in,

31:05.589 --> 31:07.182
I gotta figure out another bracket.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.194
On Saturday night, I was early.

31:23.607 --> 31:27.657
I don't know why,
but I really expected her to come.

31:29.070 --> 31:31.072
Anyway, she didn't show.

31:42.584 --> 31:43.944
Can I have the check, please?

31:47.464 --> 31:48.886
Eh, Colette!

31:54.429 --> 31:55.851
No, thank you.

32:00.227 --> 32:01.604
Lieutenant.

32:01.937 --> 32:03.314
Yes, ma'am.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.116
Come, sit down.

32:07.317 --> 32:09.285
Let me buy a fellow American a drink.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.556
It's been a long time
since I've had the privilege.

32:12.656 --> 32:15.205
You're very kind, but, uh,
I'm sort of in a hurry.

32:15.534 --> 32:16.581
Please.

32:21.248 --> 32:24.151
Beside, I've had enough
to drink for one night.

32:24.251 --> 32:26.820
I thought all American soldiers
drink as much as they can.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.155
As quickly as they can.

32:28.255 --> 32:29.598
Some do.

32:30.131 --> 32:32.429
I would, too, if I were a soldier.

32:34.135 --> 32:36.137
You, uh, were waiting for someone.

32:36.429 --> 32:37.726
A girl?

32:37.889 --> 32:40.083
If you'll excuse me now,
I have other plans.

32:40.183 --> 32:41.918
What other plans,

32:42.018 --> 32:43.645
if you don't mind my asking?

32:44.229 --> 32:45.446
No, I don't mind you asking.

32:47.482 --> 32:49.075
Sit down, Sam.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.154
I'm Monique's mother, of course.

32:55.657 --> 32:59.728
It was, uh, rather rude of me
to pretend to be otherwise, wasn't it?

32:59.828 --> 33:01.205
Yes, it was.

33:02.289 --> 33:04.291
Are you always so honest?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.167
No, not really.

33:07.377 --> 33:09.696
You ever been
out of the States before, Sam?

33:09.796 --> 33:11.924
No. Well, once, I went to Catalina Island.

33:13.883 --> 33:15.619
You like living in Los Angeles?

33:15.719 --> 33:17.746
You're in the construction business.

33:17.846 --> 33:19.623
Is there much money in that?

33:19.723 --> 33:21.166
Mrs. Blair...

33:21.266 --> 33:23.210
I'm not asking for your daughter's
hand in marriage.

33:23.310 --> 33:26.063
I just wanted to spend
an evening with her.

33:26.646 --> 33:27.881
Did you sail from New York?

33:27.981 --> 33:28.924
Mm-hmm.

33:29.024 --> 33:31.402
I remember the morning I left.

33:31.693 --> 33:34.658
The sun was shining
and there was just a little haze.

33:36.239 --> 33:38.099
That was 20 years ago.

33:38.199 --> 33:39.200
Leaving,

33:39.492 --> 33:41.460
that's what I remember best.

33:42.579 --> 33:45.106
I remember there were
some very nice gray ladies.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.709
They gave each of us a cup of coffee

33:47.959 --> 33:50.257
and then word came to board ship,

33:51.713 --> 33:53.406
and each and every one of us stooped down

33:53.506 --> 33:56.259
and placed the cup next to his right foot.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.644
And then as the ship
pulled out of the dock,

34:02.015 --> 34:04.985
I looked down and saw all of these cups.

34:06.686 --> 34:10.407
Some guy behind me said
they looked like rows of tombstones,

34:11.358 --> 34:13.110
and maybe some of them were.

34:15.362 --> 34:16.804
Come on, Sam.

34:16.905 --> 34:19.033
Monique's waiting dinner for us.

34:20.408 --> 34:22.936
How do you feel about riding in a jeep?

34:23.036 --> 34:27.732
Well, it's one of the several experiences
I promised myself before I die.

34:27.831 --> 34:28.833
Uh!

34:29.250 --> 34:31.799
Another is jumping out of a parachute.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.947
No, dear, you jump out of a plane.

34:34.047 --> 34:36.014
You hold on to the parachute.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.878
It was quite a place they lived in.

34:48.978 --> 34:50.380
We had a home-cooked meal,

34:50.480 --> 34:52.949
and after dinner,
Monique took me on a tour.

34:56.569 --> 34:58.617
During the occupation,

34:59.364 --> 35:02.163
Mama and I each had
an hour alone in this room

35:02.409 --> 35:03.786
every day.

35:04.285 --> 35:06.688
Uh, hers was from 3:00 to 4:00
in the afternoon,

35:06.788 --> 35:09.758
and mine was
from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.151
It's a lovely room.

35:11.251 --> 35:12.298
Yes.

35:15.505 --> 35:17.198
What is this, Monique?

35:18.383 --> 35:20.602
It is a piece of brown bread.

35:21.010 --> 35:22.808
An old family relic?

35:23.054 --> 35:24.146
No.

35:24.931 --> 35:28.168
No. There... There was one week

35:28.268 --> 35:30.521
when there were 30 of us in the villa...

35:31.020 --> 35:35.025
Mostly refugee children, like...
Like Jean-Francois, remember?

35:35.900 --> 35:38.494
And we had only brown bread
and water to drink.

35:39.696 --> 35:43.872
My father said that when the time came
that we had enough again,

35:44.951 --> 35:47.921
and there would be such a time, he said,

35:48.705 --> 35:51.834
I must not forget
what it is like to be hungry.

35:54.836 --> 35:56.112
So you kept it.

35:56.212 --> 35:57.213
Mm-hmm.

35:58.131 --> 36:00.384
Your father must have been quite a guy.

36:01.634 --> 36:03.136
When did he die?

36:04.554 --> 36:06.352
About two years ago.

36:07.807 --> 36:09.730
I miss him very much.

36:10.018 --> 36:11.611
I'm sure you do.

36:12.479 --> 36:13.755
Sam...

36:13.855 --> 36:15.256
Oh, I've got to run.

36:15.356 --> 36:17.425
I've got to get back to the outfit.
I'm on the midnight shift.

36:17.525 --> 36:18.468
Oh.

36:18.568 --> 36:20.178
Now that the Germans are gone,

36:20.278 --> 36:22.701
I keep thinking that the war is over.

36:23.406 --> 36:24.908
Is it bad?

36:25.700 --> 36:26.768
No, it's been worse,

36:26.868 --> 36:29.604
but it's always bad
when somebody's shooting at you.

36:29.704 --> 36:31.272
You be careful, now.

36:31.372 --> 36:33.921
I am the most careful girl in these parts.

36:35.919 --> 36:37.671
Return soon.

36:39.172 --> 36:41.049
It has been most pleasant.

36:41.257 --> 36:42.884
It was wonderful.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.887
Uh, Monique...

36:45.512 --> 36:48.766
In America, we have a custom
called a good-night kiss.

36:49.516 --> 36:52.019
It is the custom in many countries.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.024
May I kiss you?

36:54.562 --> 36:56.906
I should like you to.

37:03.571 --> 37:04.914
Good night.

37:08.576 --> 37:10.478
I had never seen the moon so bright.

37:10.578 --> 37:12.439
Right then, I could've KO'd Joe Louis,

37:12.539 --> 37:15.008
hit a homer for the Giants
and climbed an Alp.

37:22.090 --> 37:23.950
I lived for my passes.

37:24.050 --> 37:25.493
We went on a picnic.

37:25.593 --> 37:27.036
There was fried chicken, all right,

37:27.136 --> 37:30.891
and also pâté de foie-gras sandwiches,
and a view.

37:31.391 --> 37:33.710
I'd heard it's the most beautiful
in the world.

37:33.810 --> 37:34.902
I'll buy that.

37:35.645 --> 37:37.005
We went pedal-pushing.

37:37.105 --> 37:39.233
It's for kids, you know, like me.

37:41.067 --> 37:42.594
I made a deal with the Mess Sergeant.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.762
I gave him my liquor ration,

37:43.862 --> 37:47.162
and he gave me, well,
a lot more food than it was worth.

37:54.330 --> 37:56.003
I did them in at poker,

37:57.458 --> 38:00.086
and Mrs. Blair murdered me at chess.

38:06.134 --> 38:09.183
And then there was
that night in the garden.

38:12.056 --> 38:15.026
I know one thing,
you are not very much for flowers,

38:15.143 --> 38:18.147
but in here I planted
these American beauties.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.490
But it is not time for a goodnight kiss.

38:28.740 --> 38:32.415
Mm-hmm, but in America,
some people just don't wait.

38:32.785 --> 38:34.729
If they feel like kissing, they kiss.

38:34.829 --> 38:37.002
Kiss, kiss, kiss all the time.

38:37.624 --> 38:39.297
That's how I feel

38:39.459 --> 38:40.836
with you.

38:48.968 --> 38:49.969
Monique,

38:50.136 --> 38:51.913
remember the day we met

38:52.013 --> 38:53.515
at Madame Brieux's,

38:53.681 --> 38:55.375
and she said something to me in French

38:55.475 --> 38:57.210
and I asked you what she said?

38:57.310 --> 39:00.154
And you told me that
she wished me much luck?

39:01.189 --> 39:02.907
Yes, I... I remember.

39:03.691 --> 39:05.785
Well, that wasn't what she said.

39:06.152 --> 39:07.199
No.

39:07.820 --> 39:11.370
I consulted an expert
and found out what she really said was,

39:12.367 --> 39:14.540
she wished for me a great love.

39:15.536 --> 39:18.289
Now, that was quite a thing
for her to say because,

39:18.456 --> 39:19.440
well,

39:19.540 --> 39:21.276
I'm not much of a catch.

39:21.376 --> 39:24.153
As a matter of fact,
nobody ever tried to catch me,

39:24.253 --> 39:27.097
and I've never tried
to catch anybody either.

39:28.383 --> 39:29.384
Well...

39:31.386 --> 39:33.559
What I'm trying to say is that

39:34.847 --> 39:36.474
I love you, Monique.

39:36.724 --> 39:38.397
I love you very much.

39:45.525 --> 39:46.697
But you don't love me.

39:48.236 --> 39:49.237
No, Sam.

39:51.155 --> 39:52.156
Well...

39:52.448 --> 39:54.416
You can't win 'em all.

39:55.118 --> 39:56.415
Sam,

39:56.953 --> 39:59.422
when I came home that first afternoon,

39:59.872 --> 40:01.608
I said to my mother...

40:01.708 --> 40:04.131
"I have met a very nice American

40:04.669 --> 40:06.863
"from Los Angeles, California.

40:06.963 --> 40:09.282
"A lieutenant," I said.

40:09.382 --> 40:11.760
"And it would be my dearest wish

40:12.427 --> 40:14.521
"that he would like me,

40:15.013 --> 40:16.856
"and that he want me

40:17.181 --> 40:18.808
"as a friend."

40:19.684 --> 40:21.357
I still wish that.

40:22.228 --> 40:24.356
I'll settle for that for now.

40:25.606 --> 40:29.611
Mmm, that love-at-first-sight routine
rarely happens anyway,

40:29.902 --> 40:31.620
and we've got time.

40:33.114 --> 40:34.491
I'll try to make you love me,

40:35.450 --> 40:37.185
and I hope you will.

40:37.285 --> 40:39.287
No, Sam. There is no such hope.

40:40.455 --> 40:43.254
You... You can't stop me from trying.

40:43.791 --> 40:45.759
I can stop seeing you.

40:46.919 --> 40:48.341
I will.

40:56.804 --> 40:58.226
That's fine.

40:59.682 --> 41:01.793
I always say, "If you're going
to kick a guy in the teeth,

41:01.893 --> 41:03.736
"be sure to use both feet."

41:05.688 --> 41:07.632
It is for you that I have said that.

41:07.732 --> 41:08.904
Thanks a lot.

41:09.150 --> 41:10.402
Sam!

41:11.527 --> 41:12.528
Sam.

41:12.987 --> 41:14.555
I was just shoving off.

41:14.655 --> 41:15.932
Sam, I was listening.

41:16.032 --> 41:19.832
Well, good for you. It will save
a lot of time, a lot of trouble.

41:20.369 --> 41:21.712
Come in.

41:23.331 --> 41:24.708
Come in, Sam.

41:25.666 --> 41:26.667
Please.

41:51.067 --> 41:53.365
Uh, sit down, Sam, please.

42:04.038 --> 42:06.211
I have had something to tell you

42:06.666 --> 42:09.044
ever since that first afternoon.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.512
I did not because

42:11.879 --> 42:14.382
I did not see any point to it then.

42:17.635 --> 42:18.636
No, that...

42:19.428 --> 42:21.055
That is not true.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.892
I did not because

42:24.559 --> 42:25.811
I liked you.

42:27.019 --> 42:28.441
Uh, I still do,

42:30.064 --> 42:31.065
but...

42:31.941 --> 42:33.238
I... I

42:33.693 --> 42:35.411
know how Americans

42:35.611 --> 42:37.363
feel about some things.

42:39.198 --> 42:40.825
I have read and

42:41.242 --> 42:44.121
I know the way so many
of the soldiers talk.

42:46.706 --> 42:47.648
I...

42:47.748 --> 42:49.295
I have told you

42:50.918 --> 42:52.111
that my father

42:52.211 --> 42:53.963
was a very great man.

42:55.173 --> 42:57.016
Believe me, he was.

43:07.393 --> 43:09.191
He was also a negro.

43:25.578 --> 43:26.795
I guess

43:27.038 --> 43:28.022
"nigger" is

43:28.122 --> 43:31.422
one of the first words
you learn in America, isn't it?

43:37.131 --> 43:38.474
Good... Goodbye, Sam.

43:53.147 --> 43:55.650
Monique's father was a rare man.

44:01.864 --> 44:04.242
I've never known another like him.

44:12.959 --> 44:15.838
This picture was taken
a year before he died.

44:26.264 --> 44:27.857
Fred was a poor boy

44:28.683 --> 44:30.310
from Georgia.

44:31.227 --> 44:33.355
His mother took in washing

44:34.188 --> 44:36.361
and he never knew his father.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.777
But he ran errands,

44:39.110 --> 44:40.178
he swept floors,

44:40.278 --> 44:43.407
he dug ditches to get through
Hampton Institute.

44:45.157 --> 44:48.707
And at 35, he was president of
an insurance company in Philadelphia.

44:56.377 --> 44:59.221
I was a public health nurse
in West Virginia.

45:01.090 --> 45:03.593
When I went back home to Philadelphia,

45:04.385 --> 45:07.480
I met him for the first time
at a welfare conference.

45:09.223 --> 45:11.396
I fell in love with him

45:12.393 --> 45:14.521
and married him.

45:15.021 --> 45:18.070
I didn't care what color his skin was.

45:19.191 --> 45:20.989
He was the finest,

45:21.527 --> 45:24.246
dearest man I've ever known in my life.

45:38.919 --> 45:40.717
When the time came,

45:42.256 --> 45:44.805
I discovered I was going to have a child.

45:46.302 --> 45:48.100
I cried that night.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.020
I said to my husband...

45:54.185 --> 45:56.062
"There are ways," I said.

45:58.314 --> 46:00.942
See, for us, it hadn't mattered
what people thought.

46:01.108 --> 46:02.843
We walked the streets of Philadelphia,

46:02.943 --> 46:04.303
proud and

46:04.403 --> 46:05.529
defiant,

46:06.030 --> 46:07.703
and in love.

46:09.283 --> 46:10.705
But a child...

46:14.080 --> 46:16.378
My husband was a rock of a man.

46:18.167 --> 46:19.544
He said...

46:21.003 --> 46:23.097
"It is the will of God."

46:27.259 --> 46:29.478
He said, "We will go to France.

46:30.012 --> 46:33.312
"In France, they have
a beautiful blindness to color.

46:35.142 --> 46:37.315
"Our child will be French."

46:41.399 --> 46:43.493
We've lived here ever since.

46:44.652 --> 46:46.620
All our friends were French.

46:49.323 --> 46:52.918
Monique was 13 when
the last Americans left the Riviera.

46:54.787 --> 46:57.836
She had not seen one since
until she met you.

47:01.210 --> 47:04.180
Maybe I should've told you
that first night, but...

47:04.380 --> 47:08.180
I thought to myself, "Sam is a soldier.
He will soon move on."

47:12.847 --> 47:14.498
I'm going to bed now, Sam.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.976
Please don't say anything. Please.

47:19.520 --> 47:23.157
If you want to come back and see us,
you'll always be welcome here.

47:24.316 --> 47:25.568
If not,

47:27.361 --> 47:30.205
you've already given us
a lot of happiness.

47:58.642 --> 48:00.815
I fought two wars that week...

48:01.020 --> 48:02.880
My own and the Army's.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.799
The Army's was easy.

48:04.899 --> 48:06.993
Mostly, I thought about that word.

48:07.735 --> 48:09.178
Monique was wrong.

48:09.278 --> 48:11.389
It's not the ﬁrst one you learn at all,

48:11.489 --> 48:13.742
and some kids never learn it at all.

48:14.074 --> 48:16.102
Some learn it and never use it.

48:16.202 --> 48:18.751
I learned it early and used it often.

48:18.913 --> 48:21.257
It showed just how tough I was,

48:21.624 --> 48:23.317
and that wasn't all.

48:23.417 --> 48:26.153
Where I was brought up, Harlem near 125th,

48:26.253 --> 48:27.863
they were on one side,

48:27.963 --> 48:29.840
and we were on the other.

48:30.090 --> 48:31.558
Why? I don't know why,

48:31.967 --> 48:34.745
except a lot of people need
somebody to look down on,

48:34.845 --> 48:36.722
or they think they do.

48:37.848 --> 48:40.101
What's the matter, Lieutenant?

48:45.606 --> 48:47.028
Not a thing.

49:08.629 --> 49:11.599
It got to be Saturday night.
It always does.

49:12.633 --> 49:16.058
My mother wants to know,
am I taking my vitamin pills?

49:18.222 --> 49:21.041
I was scared, but I mean really scared.

49:21.141 --> 49:23.335
I said, "God, you get me out of this one,

49:23.435 --> 49:25.654
"and I'm really gonna shape up."

49:26.647 --> 49:30.134
I mean, I said, "God, you can trust me,
you can count on me!

49:30.234 --> 49:31.594
"No more drinkin',

49:31.694 --> 49:33.571
"no more smokin',

49:33.862 --> 49:37.099
"no more, you know,
swearin' or, uh, any of that stuff."

49:37.199 --> 49:38.893
Well, well, what happened?

49:38.993 --> 49:40.811
Well, tell you the honest truth,

49:40.911 --> 49:43.564
I don't think I had a cigarette
for about two days there.

50:13.569 --> 50:14.912
'Evening, sir.

50:16.363 --> 50:17.348
Sit down.

50:17.448 --> 50:18.432
Am I interrupting something?

50:18.532 --> 50:19.533
No.

50:22.536 --> 50:24.789
Writing a letter to my wife.

50:26.957 --> 50:29.710
She was always
in charge of Saturday night.

50:31.962 --> 50:34.306
Whatever she wanted to do, you know,

50:34.590 --> 50:36.308
it was her night.

50:38.385 --> 50:40.308
You know what we used to do?

50:41.513 --> 50:43.857
Half the time, we'd stay home,

50:45.100 --> 50:46.585
barbecue a steak,

50:46.685 --> 50:49.359
then play a couple of hands of blackjack,

50:50.064 --> 50:51.816
go to bed early.

50:53.359 --> 50:55.612
That's what we used to do.

51:00.908 --> 51:02.285
Uh, have some.

51:12.544 --> 51:15.093
Angel food cake, butterscotch frosting.

51:16.423 --> 51:18.767
Best damn cake my wife ever baked.

51:23.263 --> 51:24.264
Um...

51:27.643 --> 51:28.895
Sir, um...

51:31.605 --> 51:33.699
Well, the guys all
went off to town, and I...

51:33.941 --> 51:35.864
I wasn't gonna go,

51:36.318 --> 51:38.821
but I... I changed my mind and I...

51:40.656 --> 51:42.558
And I was wondering whether I could, uh...

51:42.658 --> 51:44.018
You can, uh,

51:44.118 --> 51:45.290
take my jeep.

51:45.619 --> 51:47.417
I'm not going anyplace.

51:47.955 --> 51:49.502
Thank you, sir.

51:50.082 --> 51:51.083
Sam...

51:54.253 --> 51:56.756
You know the worst thing in the world?

51:59.007 --> 52:00.133
Loneliness.

52:02.970 --> 52:04.222
Yes, sir.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.755
Sam!

52:37.296 --> 52:38.798
Hello, friend.

52:39.214 --> 52:40.511
Sam!

52:41.341 --> 52:42.467
Maman!

52:43.051 --> 52:44.052
Oh...

52:44.178 --> 52:45.179
Sam!

52:45.596 --> 52:46.580
Oh...

52:46.680 --> 52:48.248
You have come back.

52:48.348 --> 52:49.349
Oh.

52:50.017 --> 52:51.018
Maman!

52:51.852 --> 52:53.195
It's Sam!

52:58.525 --> 52:59.868
Welcome.

53:01.695 --> 53:04.556
Now look, we're gonna go to Nice,
all three of us.

53:04.656 --> 53:07.017
How long will it take you to put
your glad rags on?

53:07.117 --> 53:09.211
Oh, it will take only five minutes.

53:09.453 --> 53:10.479
Make it four.

53:10.579 --> 53:11.563
Oh.

53:11.663 --> 53:13.256
Well, come on, come on.

53:14.166 --> 53:15.383
No.

53:15.584 --> 53:17.528
I'm too old and too tired

53:17.628 --> 53:19.551
and I've got too much sense.

53:21.089 --> 53:22.682
You're a good man, Sammy.

53:25.052 --> 53:27.350
I'm a little better than I was a week ago.

54:00.963 --> 54:02.510
Are you happy?

54:02.631 --> 54:04.929
I am more happy than I deserve.

54:07.594 --> 54:09.767
You have, uh, whiskey-soda?

54:16.937 --> 54:19.110
Only white wine!

54:19.731 --> 54:21.699
I'll have white wine.

54:26.321 --> 54:28.182
We want the Sergeant!

54:28.282 --> 54:30.125
We want the Sergeant!

54:30.242 --> 54:31.994
We want the Sergeant!

55:29.301 --> 55:31.178
He's one of the guys in our outfit.

56:09.049 --> 56:10.847
He's pretty good, huh?

56:11.218 --> 56:12.435
Yes.

57:00.100 --> 57:01.877
Monique Blair, this is Britt Harris.

57:01.977 --> 57:03.754
Mademoiselle, enchanté.

57:03.854 --> 57:05.697
You can speak English, she's American.

57:05.856 --> 57:08.008
Oh, Sam, I knew there was
something in the wind.

57:08.108 --> 57:09.176
I'd say to him, "Where you headed?"

57:09.276 --> 57:11.345
And he'd say,
"Well, I thought I'd go and explore."

57:11.445 --> 57:14.389
Then he started asking me to translate
a couple of phrases in French.

57:14.489 --> 57:16.099
So I knew wherever he was exploring

57:16.199 --> 57:18.327
that the, uh, natives were friendly.

57:22.372 --> 57:24.566
Why don't you sit down?
Get your girlfriend, bring her over.

57:24.666 --> 57:26.026
Oh, I don't think she's feeling well.

57:26.126 --> 57:27.799
She's got a toothache.

57:28.920 --> 57:30.405
You play beautifully.

57:30.505 --> 57:32.115
Thank you. Thank you very, very much.

57:32.215 --> 57:33.867
Where'd you pick up that little sideline?

57:33.967 --> 57:35.661
Oh, I've been blowing the horn
most of my life.

57:35.761 --> 57:37.704
The year I was supposedly
at Cornell University

57:37.804 --> 57:39.164
studying Business Administration,

57:39.264 --> 57:41.625
I used to spend most of my time
on 52nd Street.

57:41.725 --> 57:44.127
Oh, do you know the singing
of Bessie Smith?

57:44.227 --> 57:46.213
Do I? I've got every record she ever made.

57:46.313 --> 57:47.381
Oh.

57:47.481 --> 57:48.924
I have only one.

57:49.024 --> 57:51.051
Well, I'll see that you get some of mine.

57:51.151 --> 57:53.553
Do you know the recordings
of Monsieur Jacques Frenet?

57:53.653 --> 57:54.870
Jacques Frenet?

57:57.908 --> 58:00.018
Sam, you're such a sly one.

58:00.118 --> 58:01.561
Huh, he's so solid, isn't he?

58:01.661 --> 58:02.896
Big time operator. Solid Sam.

58:02.996 --> 58:03.939
I'll give you some news...

58:04.039 --> 58:07.150
From now on in, I'm going to take
lessons from you, 'cause you're the master.

58:08.335 --> 58:09.861
No, no, no, no, tomorrow night.

58:09.961 --> 58:12.614
- Oh, please.
- Let's get out of here.

58:12.714 --> 58:16.868
I know a delightful little place that sells
the craziest fromage and some chablis.

58:16.968 --> 58:18.328
Oh, and some pâté?

58:18.428 --> 58:20.414
I've not had any for a very long time.

58:20.514 --> 58:23.267
If you want pâté, you're gonna get pâté.

58:24.184 --> 58:25.185
Come on.

58:25.560 --> 58:26.561
Goodbye.

58:54.714 --> 58:57.308
We dropped Britt at the hotel
we were staying at.

58:58.385 --> 59:00.934
I don't think Monique said
two words on the way home.

59:16.653 --> 59:18.621
You like him, don't you?

59:21.116 --> 59:22.208
Yes.

59:24.035 --> 59:25.378
It figures.

59:26.246 --> 59:29.796
Yeah, he's a smooth operator,
a real fancy dancer and talker.

59:30.125 --> 59:31.193
Why do you say that?

59:31.293 --> 59:34.488
Because I know him, and I know
he knows all the angles.

59:34.588 --> 59:35.947
That is a good trait, I think.

59:36.047 --> 59:39.017
Maybe, if you don't play poker
with him too often.

59:40.927 --> 59:42.412
It was a beautiful evening

59:42.512 --> 59:43.764
and night

59:43.930 --> 59:45.398
and sunrise.

59:45.932 --> 59:47.184
Thank you.

59:47.767 --> 59:49.211
You're welcome, Monique.

59:49.311 --> 59:50.337
Good night.

59:50.437 --> 59:51.438
Sam...

59:53.940 --> 59:56.113
Thank you for coming back.

59:58.486 --> 59:59.487
Will...

01:00:00.238 --> 01:00:02.457
Will you tell Britt about me?

01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:06.995
I'll tell him.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.994
Sam?

01:00:23.094 --> 01:00:24.037
Uh-huh?

01:00:24.137 --> 01:00:26.206
What are you going
to do when the war's over?

01:00:26.306 --> 01:00:28.650
Probably go back to Los Angeles.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.627
Why don't you come and work with me?

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:31.711
Huh.

01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:32.754
You think we'd get along?

01:00:32.854 --> 01:00:33.855
Great.

01:00:34.356 --> 01:00:36.383
Just so long as we know who's the boss.

01:00:36.483 --> 01:00:37.484
You.

01:00:42.989 --> 01:00:43.990
Sam...

01:00:45.825 --> 01:00:48.544
How serious are you about Monique?

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.957
What do you mean?

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.547
Well, um...

01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:57.342
Uh, how serious?

01:00:59.172 --> 01:01:01.140
We're just good friends.

01:01:02.217 --> 01:01:03.514
That all?

01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:06.513
That's all.

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.857
I like her a lot, Sam.

01:01:15.855 --> 01:01:17.402
I like her a lot.

01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:21.528
I believe you.

01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:25.140
You want to go with me
next time we get a pass?

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.559
Her mother cooks up some pretty fair chow.

01:01:27.659 --> 01:01:28.831
Great.

01:01:31.538 --> 01:01:34.291
She asked me to tell you something, Britt.

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:37.719
She asked me to tell you that

01:01:38.712 --> 01:01:40.714
her father was a negro.

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:47.766
What do you know?

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.455
That's the way it was.

01:02:09.576 --> 01:02:11.686
You'd think the war was over and wham,

01:02:11.786 --> 01:02:13.834
it started all over again.

01:02:14.414 --> 01:02:16.416
And this time it didn't stop.

01:02:17.459 --> 01:02:20.008
Three days later,
they were still sending them in.

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:05.089
Britt.

01:03:19.187 --> 01:03:22.340
Sam, I'd love to sneak up behind 'em
and see what's going on.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.818
You can't see anything from here.

01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:28.847
You know, there's one spot
where you can see the whole works from...

01:03:28.947 --> 01:03:30.244
Checkpoint 30.

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:31.558
That's the town hall tower.

01:03:31.658 --> 01:03:32.875
Yeah.

01:03:34.369 --> 01:03:36.021
And you can bet it ain't well-manned.

01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:37.897
This is too good a target for us.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.344
You know, I'll bet a couple
of guys could get in there.

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:53.180
Sure, with Superman suits.

01:03:57.892 --> 01:03:59.644
Don't they ever run out?

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.256
I sure would like to take a whack at it.

01:04:03.356 --> 01:04:05.901
Samuel, what's the first
thing you learned...

01:04:06.025 --> 01:04:08.928
The very first thing you learned
in basic training?

01:04:09.028 --> 01:04:10.138
Never to volunteer for anything.

01:04:10.238 --> 01:04:11.410
Right.

01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:14.042
I still think we could do it.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.331
"We" could do it?

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.398
You don't think I'd be idiot enough
to go alone?

01:04:20.498 --> 01:04:21.691
Sam, you don't seem to understand...

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.668
Here, cocktail hour.

01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:40.728
Did he go for the town hall idea,
or did he think we were nuts?

01:04:40.894 --> 01:04:44.672
No, he didn't think we were nuts.
He said he'd pass it on to headquarters.

01:04:44.772 --> 01:04:45.799
Well, that's the end of that.

01:04:45.899 --> 01:04:47.258
If you want to bury something in the army,

01:04:47.358 --> 01:04:49.302
all you do is you send it
through channels in triplicate.

01:04:49.402 --> 01:04:51.012
He didn't take away
our overnight pass, though?

01:04:51.112 --> 01:04:52.639
He wouldn't dare.

01:04:52.739 --> 01:04:55.367
Well, away we go like whooping cranes.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:58.207
Oh, uh, Britt...

01:04:59.412 --> 01:05:01.940
I've seen you in action, comrade,
and I just wanted you to know

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.920
that Monique is a very nice girl,
and she bruises easily. I know.

01:05:07.754 --> 01:05:11.241
You're not going to believe this, Sam,
but before I put on this Buster Brown outfit,

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:14.828
I went out with a couple of nice girls
and never had any complaints.

01:05:14.928 --> 01:05:17.022
- Allez?
- Allons!

01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:25.797
And he was wonderful with her, of course.

01:05:25.897 --> 01:05:27.549
He even knew all about flowers.

01:05:27.649 --> 01:05:32.137
They liked the same books, the same music,
and they spoke the same language... French.

01:05:32.237 --> 01:05:34.205
They both liked Picasso and...

01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:36.599
There was one other thing...

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.768
She was in love with him.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.791
I didn't know about him.

01:05:41.955 --> 01:05:43.628
I never knew about him.

01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:54.492
Britt and I went on
almost every pass together

01:05:54.592 --> 01:05:56.077
and it was always the same...

01:05:56.177 --> 01:05:58.726
There were the two of them, and me.

01:06:00.306 --> 01:06:02.125
Sam, I know you're not much
of a wine drinker,

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:04.398
but this stuff is the wildest.

01:06:04.811 --> 01:06:05.812
Here.

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:07.797
Bonsoir, madame.

01:06:26.624 --> 01:06:28.126
Want to let me in on it?

01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:30.778
Uh, she said that friendship

01:06:30.878 --> 01:06:33.072
between a man and a woman is, uh...
Is what?

01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:34.616
Is only for

01:06:34.716 --> 01:06:36.075
those who are

01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:37.577
very old

01:06:37.677 --> 01:06:39.520
or very tired.

01:06:45.727 --> 01:06:47.045
Oh, Sam,

01:06:47.145 --> 01:06:48.922
you should not drink chablis that way.

01:06:49.022 --> 01:06:51.650
It is a tender wine.
It must be sipped only.

01:06:52.191 --> 01:06:53.693
Yeah, I'm a slob.

01:06:54.861 --> 01:06:56.488
A very sweet slob.

01:06:56.863 --> 01:06:58.080
Thanks.

01:06:59.824 --> 01:07:01.309
Hey, why don't we play that game,

01:07:01.409 --> 01:07:02.977
uh, "I Love My Love Because"?

01:07:03.077 --> 01:07:04.771
Oh, yes, that is a lovely game.

01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:05.813
No.

01:07:05.913 --> 01:07:06.898
Sam, look, it's a very simple...

01:07:06.998 --> 01:07:07.999
No!

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.135
I'll get the check.

01:08:36.629 --> 01:08:38.723
Why don't you two go along? I'm not going.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:43.536
Notre Dame de la Garoupe
is very beautiful at night.

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:46.122
I've seen a cathedral and a lighthouse.

01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.832
But never together, Sam.
It's the only one like it.

01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:50.417
You sure you don't want to come along?

01:08:50.518 --> 01:08:51.502
Uh-huh.

01:08:51.602 --> 01:08:53.194
- You sure?
- I'm sure!

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:56.566
Mind if we take the jeep?

01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:58.363
No, go right ahead.

01:08:58.651 --> 01:08:59.636
Have a good time.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:00.953
Thank you, Sam.

01:09:29.223 --> 01:09:30.600
Hello, Joe.

01:09:53.538 --> 01:09:55.024
Desirez, monsieur?

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:56.234
Cognac.

01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:57.756
Grand ou petit?

01:09:57.877 --> 01:09:59.049
Grand.

01:09:59.212 --> 01:10:00.509
Grand.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:04.225
The grandest, largest Cognac in the joint!

01:10:12.183 --> 01:10:13.651
Do it again!

01:11:27.758 --> 01:11:28.975
Hi, Sam.

01:11:29.927 --> 01:11:31.746
You really should have seen
that lighthouse.

01:11:31.846 --> 01:11:33.723
It was absolutely the...

01:11:34.181 --> 01:11:35.833
Hey, Sam, you're my buddy, right?

01:11:35.933 --> 01:11:37.335
Thick and thin? Fire and water?

01:11:37.435 --> 01:11:39.437
Sleet and snow? Muck and mire?

01:11:41.314 --> 01:11:44.300
Look, Sam, buddy, pal, friend,
I've been through quite a bit this morning.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.885
The old lady was waiting up for us.

01:11:45.985 --> 01:11:46.986
Huh.

01:11:49.989 --> 01:11:52.558
Sam, I think you're familiar
with the term "love."

01:11:52.658 --> 01:11:55.394
It's never properly been defined,
although a lot of guys have tried it,

01:11:55.494 --> 01:11:58.231
even those fellows that make it
with the poetry.

01:11:58.331 --> 01:12:00.333
Sam, I'm in love with the girl!

01:12:02.376 --> 01:12:04.320
Well, I didn't think
this was going to happen!

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.406
I don't care whether you hate my guts
or not, that's beside the point.

01:12:07.506 --> 01:12:10.305
But I never figured
that I was the guy that...

01:12:13.471 --> 01:12:14.472
Sam...

01:12:15.514 --> 01:12:17.516
Monique and I are going to get married.

01:12:20.061 --> 01:12:21.529
Someday, Britt?

01:12:21.896 --> 01:12:23.339
When the shooting's all over?

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.783
You're going back to New Jersey?

01:12:27.735 --> 01:12:28.736
Sam...

01:12:29.028 --> 01:12:31.702
I'm never going back to Newark.
I never was.

01:12:32.198 --> 01:12:33.199
Uh...

01:12:33.366 --> 01:12:35.852
Well, I never mentioned it
to you, but, uh...

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:39.021
I got in a little trouble when
I was back there, you know, and...

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.465
I've had Newark,
and I think Newark's had me.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:44.944
Besides, I've got a little money
going for me.

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:47.012
I've got a trust fund.
So maybe we'll even settle here.

01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:48.465
I don't know.

01:12:53.552 --> 01:12:54.895
When, Sergeant?

01:12:56.889 --> 01:12:58.416
You know how the Army is, Sam.

01:12:58.516 --> 01:13:01.294
There's a right way
and there's a wrong way.

01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:02.520
When?

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:08.301
The Chaplain, the Colonel,
everything in triplicate,

01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:10.052
right through channels.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.904
I suggest that you begin today.

01:13:13.114 --> 01:13:16.038
Sam, I was going to ask you
to be my best man.

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:18.540
I'd be delighted.

01:13:20.413 --> 01:13:22.086
Sammy, don't you trust me?

01:13:28.254 --> 01:13:30.256
I just remembered I forgot something.

01:13:36.303 --> 01:13:37.850
Congratulations.

01:13:38.097 --> 01:13:39.440
Thanks.

01:13:50.776 --> 01:13:51.928
Hello, Sam.

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:53.746
Good morning, dear.

01:13:56.449 --> 01:13:57.871
For me?

01:14:19.096 --> 01:14:20.473
Did you make him ask her?

01:14:22.141 --> 01:14:23.313
Oh, no.

01:14:25.144 --> 01:14:27.192
What... What do you think, Sammy?

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.490
Well, I'm not exactly neutral.

01:14:31.025 --> 01:14:32.493
No, you're not.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:35.780
It won't be easy for them,

01:14:36.322 --> 01:14:38.074
even at best.

01:14:39.658 --> 01:14:42.662
You know what I bet?
I bet everything turns out just dandy.

01:14:44.789 --> 01:14:45.915
Maybe.

01:14:46.624 --> 01:14:48.217
I hope that's true.

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:50.928
Monique...

01:14:51.337 --> 01:14:54.181
Well, I've protected her, and I'm

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.558
not sure I was right.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.453
Britt is handsome,

01:14:59.553 --> 01:15:00.975
charming.

01:15:01.222 --> 01:15:03.475
My daughter loves him.

01:15:05.184 --> 01:15:06.185
When he...

01:15:07.144 --> 01:15:10.398
Came to me this morning
with those great eyes

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.677
that must have got him so much
and saved him so much.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:15.778
Mm-hmm.

01:15:16.028 --> 01:15:17.905
He told me that he loved her

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.157
and wanted to marry her.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.452
Well, I said what I said.

01:15:27.081 --> 01:15:29.675
Now, go wish her
all the happiness there is.

01:15:47.768 --> 01:15:48.940
Howdy.

01:15:50.104 --> 01:15:51.964
I was hoping you would come.

01:15:52.064 --> 01:15:54.842
I thought I'd better report in
and see how you are.

01:15:54.942 --> 01:15:58.037
Uh, did Britt tell you... Tell you?

01:15:58.904 --> 01:16:01.932
Oh, he was blabbering about
love and marriage and all that stuff.

01:16:02.032 --> 01:16:05.144
I didn't quite understand
what he was talking about.

01:16:05.244 --> 01:16:06.687
I am very happy.

01:16:06.787 --> 01:16:08.164
That's good.

01:16:08.289 --> 01:16:09.290
I am in love.

01:16:10.457 --> 01:16:12.860
I guess that's about all anybody can ask.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.928
It is a very great deal.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.490
And there is even more.

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:18.908
Oh, there couldn't be.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.260
Yes.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.438
That first night,

01:16:24.763 --> 01:16:26.390
uh, when he was here,

01:16:26.724 --> 01:16:28.397
we went into the garden

01:16:29.435 --> 01:16:31.062
and he looked at me, and

01:16:31.437 --> 01:16:32.859
he said...

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:35.491
"Sam has told me about your father.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:38.198
"You must be very proud of him."

01:16:40.613 --> 01:16:43.457
You can see, can you not,
that I worship Britt?

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:48.496
I think you've got it all taped,
all buttoned up.

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:53.964
You approve then?

01:16:55.961 --> 01:16:57.863
Well, I wouldn't want to get this around,

01:16:57.963 --> 01:16:59.949
but I'm puttin' in for best man.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.742
You think I got a chance?

01:17:01.842 --> 01:17:02.827
Oh!

01:17:02.927 --> 01:17:05.555
I shall speak to the man in charge.

01:17:13.979 --> 01:17:16.590
Hey, Sam, I thought
you weren't coming back.

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:17.987
I'm back.

01:17:18.943 --> 01:17:19.927
Britt?

01:17:20.027 --> 01:17:21.028
Hmm?

01:17:21.695 --> 01:17:23.055
You're not kiddin' this time, are you?

01:17:23.155 --> 01:17:25.249
You're not just foolin' around?

01:17:25.699 --> 01:17:27.997
Sam, I'm in love with the girl.

01:17:28.285 --> 01:17:29.332
Okay.

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.647
There's just one thing worries me.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:32.999
What's that?

01:17:33.123 --> 01:17:35.568
I haven't got a thing
to wear for this wedding.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:52.856
He got the marriage application
the next day.

01:17:56.522 --> 01:17:58.900
A month passed and then another,

01:17:59.233 --> 01:18:00.926
and the Germans kept pouring them in,

01:18:01.026 --> 01:18:03.512
and every week,
a few more men were killed.

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.848
But there was still
no word on the mission.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:08.201
Finally, the old man sent for me.

01:18:12.663 --> 01:18:14.006
Hi, Lieutenant.

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:19.695
He'll be with you in just a minute.
He just got back from regiment.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:23.115
Havin' a little conference with the staff,
you see. Take a load off, Lieutenant.

01:18:23.215 --> 01:18:24.888
Thank you, Corporal.

01:18:26.385 --> 01:18:27.386
1725...

01:18:27.886 --> 01:18:29.288
Tell me, uh...

01:18:29.388 --> 01:18:31.790
How's the pride of Newark, New Jersey
making out?

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:34.710
He's turning out to be
a damn fine soldier.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:35.902
Yeah?

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.398
You know what General Grant always said.

01:18:38.564 --> 01:18:41.363
No, what did General Grant "always said"?

01:18:41.525 --> 01:18:43.177
I don't know. He just, uh...

01:18:43.277 --> 01:18:45.095
He said somethin'.

01:18:45.195 --> 01:18:47.765
By the way, how's our boy's
marriage application coming along?

01:18:47.865 --> 01:18:50.744
It's been in the works
for over two months now.

01:18:50.909 --> 01:18:53.833
Are you kiddin'? He picked those papers
up here about three weeks ago.

01:18:54.204 --> 01:18:57.003
He just never brought 'em back.
I don't know.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.150
Wait a minute.

01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:01.153
Oh, yeah. Hey, listen, I, uh,
I mentioned that to him about,

01:19:01.253 --> 01:19:03.656
uh, a couple of days ago.
You know what he said?

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:05.532
He said the whole thing was a gag.

01:19:05.632 --> 01:19:07.409
It was just a big gag.

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.637
He's a character.

01:19:09.762 --> 01:19:11.372
You know what I figured?
I mean, personally,

01:19:11.472 --> 01:19:13.374
I figure that some French mama

01:19:13.474 --> 01:19:15.101
put the squeeze on our boy, you know,

01:19:15.434 --> 01:19:17.878
but he, uh, he smoothed himself out of it.

01:19:17.978 --> 01:19:19.505
You know him, he's quite a smoother.

01:19:19.605 --> 01:19:21.278
Oh, he is quite a smoother.

01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:26.070
Sam, regimental headquarters
approved your plan.

01:19:27.946 --> 01:19:30.349
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

01:19:30.449 --> 01:19:31.475
No, sir.

01:19:31.575 --> 01:19:32.576
All right.

01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:37.481
Sam, I think you know everybody.

01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:39.024
Yes, sir. Hi, Sam.

01:19:39.124 --> 01:19:41.694
Hour is 0300 at hill 209.

01:19:41.794 --> 01:19:43.195
I'll personally see you off.

01:19:43.295 --> 01:19:46.031
When you get to town hall,
set up an OP and check in

01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:47.449
and report all activity while en route.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.534
Yes, sir.

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:51.036
Now, Captain Harrison
will brief you on net operation.

01:19:51.136 --> 01:19:54.060
You won't follow
any regular radio procedure.

01:19:54.306 --> 01:19:55.853
FDC will be alerted.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.628
Two men will monitor the net
at all times for your signals.

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:03.403
Now, when you reach the tower,
switch on your radio and say...

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:05.384
"Established."

01:20:05.484 --> 01:20:06.468
Any questions?

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:07.553
No, sir.

01:20:07.653 --> 01:20:08.595
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:20:08.695 --> 01:20:10.322
Anything else?

01:20:10.948 --> 01:20:13.267
Well, I guess that about covers it.

01:20:13.367 --> 01:20:15.165
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:20:25.379 --> 01:20:27.614
Sir, does this mean
our passes are cancelled?

01:20:27.714 --> 01:20:29.716
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.

01:20:30.509 --> 01:20:34.663
Well, sir, it's important that Sergeant Harris
and I get into town for a little while.

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.874
It's, um, personal and it's...

01:20:36.974 --> 01:20:38.375
It's pretty important, sir.

01:20:38.475 --> 01:20:40.352
But I promise to get us back by 0100.

01:20:40.811 --> 01:20:42.313
I guarantee it.

01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:46.425
All right, Sam. You wouldn't ask if it
weren't important. Permission granted.

01:20:46.525 --> 01:20:49.870
I'll pick you and the Sergeant up
at your billet at 0200.

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.367
Yes, sir.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:02.775
Lieutenant Sam? Yeah.

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:04.127
Any news?

01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:05.881
Yeah, we've got it.

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.572
Tonight's the night. Hour is 0300.

01:21:08.672 --> 01:21:10.324
Well, that cancels our soufflés.

01:21:10.424 --> 01:21:13.052
No, but we've got to be back by 0100.

01:21:13.385 --> 01:21:15.308
Well, I'll shake a leg.

01:21:15.554 --> 01:21:18.374
It would've been nice if your papers
had come through.

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:20.292
Yeah, that would've been great.

01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:23.837
I went by headquarters this morning
and they told me it takes a lot of time.

01:21:23.937 --> 01:21:25.464
Well, you know how it is.

01:21:25.564 --> 01:21:29.410
You know, I sometimes think the Army
doesn't want people to get married.

01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:33.660
The ladies expect you, gentlemen.

01:21:34.573 --> 01:21:36.450
Beautiful, you're beautiful.

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:39.144
I couldn't get you a mink coat
or a bag of diamonds today

01:21:39.244 --> 01:21:41.397
'cause they didn't have any in the PX,
so I got you these.

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:44.024
- Oh, that's sweet of you, Britt.
- Well, I'm a very sweet fellow.

01:21:44.124 --> 01:21:46.151
- How are you, Sammy?
- He's not feeling well at all.

01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:47.820
All the way down the hill,
he didn't say a word.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.198
But I have a feeling that that chocolate
soufflé with those black-market eggs

01:21:51.298 --> 01:21:55.223
- is going to clear up his mind beautifully.
- You touch her, and I'll kill you.

01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:05.778
Tell her.

01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:12.845
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

01:22:12.945 --> 01:22:14.822
I talked to Corporal Lindsay today.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.144
He's not much
of a conversationalist, is he?

01:22:20.244 --> 01:22:21.587
Tell her!

01:22:23.121 --> 01:22:25.107
You really want me to, Lieutenant?

01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:27.401
Like you thought it over real hard?

01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:28.878
Mon cheri...

01:22:30.587 --> 01:22:31.634
What is wrong?

01:22:32.256 --> 01:22:33.473
Monique.

01:22:41.807 --> 01:22:43.855
Uh, I guess...

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:47.029
I guess what Sam means is

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:49.941
I'm not going to marry you, Monique.

01:22:52.859 --> 01:22:53.860
That's about it, I guess.

01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:04.796
You never even planned to, did you?

01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:09.459
You scum.

01:23:10.002 --> 01:23:12.404
I don't like that word, coming from you.

01:23:12.504 --> 01:23:14.256
Get out of my house.

01:23:16.008 --> 01:23:17.351
Mrs. Blair?

01:23:17.968 --> 01:23:20.287
On several occasions,
I've been engaged to marry,

01:23:20.387 --> 01:23:24.108
and on several occasions I've been not
engaged to marry, if you follow me.

01:23:25.642 --> 01:23:29.363
And a lot of these girls I wouldn't
take to a country club, but

01:23:29.855 --> 01:23:32.859
with the exception of your daughter,
Mrs. Blair,

01:23:33.025 --> 01:23:35.073
all of them were white.

01:23:38.864 --> 01:23:40.116
Sam, look,

01:23:40.824 --> 01:23:42.226
you understand.

01:23:42.326 --> 01:23:44.203
It was like a new kick for me.

01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:00.644
Come on, Sam, you...

01:24:04.389 --> 01:24:05.390
Sam!

01:24:07.684 --> 01:24:08.919
Sam, she's gone!

01:24:09.019 --> 01:24:10.316
I'll find her.

01:25:01.905 --> 01:25:04.433
Captain, Captain,
it was I who rescued her.

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:06.560
I was coming home slowly,
taking my leisure

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.395
because it is so beautiful an evening,

01:25:08.495 --> 01:25:10.230
then I saw the girl running fast.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:12.441
At first, I think she's going
to a rendezvous,

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:14.651
but then I recognize she's trying to jump.

01:25:14.751 --> 01:25:17.971
I was very close behind her,
but below are many rocks...

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:23.885
Monique.

01:25:25.762 --> 01:25:26.809
Monique, it's Sam.

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:32.148
I'm your... Your friend, Monique.

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:35.063
Monique.

01:25:37.607 --> 01:25:38.800
Go away.

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:39.211
I don't know when I decided...

01:26:39.711 --> 01:26:41.554
When I saw Monique's face,

01:26:42.714 --> 01:26:44.783
when I left her mother at the villa

01:26:44.883 --> 01:26:46.726
or when I got back.

01:26:55.227 --> 01:26:56.900
Now, any questions?

01:26:57.062 --> 01:26:58.255
No, sir.

01:26:58.355 --> 01:27:01.404
I'm gonna have to take
your sidearm and your rifle.

01:27:02.234 --> 01:27:03.326
Sir?

01:27:03.902 --> 01:27:06.972
If you don't have weapons,
you'll hide instead of trying to shoot.

01:27:07.072 --> 01:27:08.699
Now, you can carry your knives.

01:27:09.491 --> 01:27:11.368
Sam, you still with me?

01:27:12.244 --> 01:27:14.463
Yes, sir, I'm still with you.

01:27:24.756 --> 01:27:26.099
Good luck, Sam.

01:27:26.383 --> 01:27:27.534
Thank you, Colonel.

01:27:27.634 --> 01:27:29.056
Sergeant.

01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:00.459
Wait a minute, Sam.

01:28:02.127 --> 01:28:03.128
Uh...

01:28:03.295 --> 01:28:05.172
It's a long way down this hill.

01:28:06.006 --> 01:28:08.759
Shake hands with me, huh? What do you say?

01:28:10.635 --> 01:28:13.309
Sergeant, I'm going to kill you.

01:28:13.471 --> 01:28:16.145
I don't know when or where or how,

01:28:16.266 --> 01:28:17.643
but I'm going to kill you.

01:28:21.438 --> 01:28:23.215
Sam, I'm not proud of what I did.

01:28:23.315 --> 01:28:24.817
I apologize.

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:28.178
Look, in a month, six weeks,
she won't even remember my name.

01:28:28.278 --> 01:28:29.495
I'm going to kill you.

01:28:34.826 --> 01:28:37.521
If you think I'm going on a mission
with a nut like you,

01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:39.464
you've got rocks in your head!

01:28:39.789 --> 01:28:41.900
I'll see that you get court-martialed...

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.173
Desertion in the face of the enemy.

01:28:44.461 --> 01:28:46.363
That'll be just dandy,

01:28:46.463 --> 01:28:48.591
and, by God, I'll make it stick.

01:28:50.175 --> 01:28:51.347
Now, get moving.

01:28:55.055 --> 01:28:57.308
It works both ways, Lieutenant.

01:28:58.016 --> 01:28:59.251
I'll give the Colonel your dog tags.

01:28:59.351 --> 01:29:01.545
I'll say, ah, "A sniper got him."

01:29:01.645 --> 01:29:04.589
Or maybe I'll say,
"He stepped on a mine, sir. It was awful."

01:29:04.689 --> 01:29:07.092
It'd be a long time before
they found your body,

01:29:07.192 --> 01:29:08.660
and by then, who'd know?

01:29:10.028 --> 01:29:12.222
Listen, Lieutenant,
anybody you want me to write to?

01:29:12.322 --> 01:29:13.869
Funny.

01:29:14.616 --> 01:29:16.038
Now, get moving!

01:29:18.203 --> 01:29:20.438
Don't worry, you won't get it in the back.

01:29:20.538 --> 01:29:23.417
When I kill you, I want to see your face.

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:25.210
Move.

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:42.644
Halt!

01:29:45.063 --> 01:29:46.064
Amerikaner!

01:32:45.076 --> 01:32:46.419
Psst. Come here.

01:33:09.434 --> 01:33:11.152
There's our bunker.

01:33:11.603 --> 01:33:13.822
Man, it's a long way back home.

01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:20.278
Okay, tell 'em we're here.

01:33:20.445 --> 01:33:21.867
Established.

01:33:22.238 --> 01:33:24.366
Checkpoint 1... Illuminate.

01:33:25.074 --> 01:33:26.872
Checkpoint 1... Illuminate.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.549
No wonder we couldn't spot it!

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:35.380
Checkpoint 1...

01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:39.173
Heavy artillery, fire for effect. Over.

01:33:40.798 --> 01:33:42.596
Blow hell out of it.

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:45.432
Bingo!

01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:48.289
Now, let's clean out this valley
once and for all.

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:50.750
Checkpoint 7... Illuminate.
Checkpoint 8... Illuminate.

01:33:50.850 --> 01:33:52.252
Checkpoint 1 -6... Illuminate.

01:33:52.352 --> 01:33:54.229
Checkpoint... Wait a minute!

01:33:54.854 --> 01:33:56.401
One at a time.

01:33:58.316 --> 01:33:59.989
Okay. Checkpoint 7.

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.157
Checkpoint 7.

01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:05.244
Bingo!

01:34:05.448 --> 01:34:06.950
Checkpoint 1 -0.

01:34:07.283 --> 01:34:09.126
Checkpoint 1 -0.

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:11.746
Bingo.

01:34:12.205 --> 01:34:13.377
Checkpoint 8.

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:14.673
Checkpoint 8.

01:34:15.667 --> 01:34:16.839
Bingo!

01:34:22.882 --> 01:34:24.475
Psst.

01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:28.847
Britt, look.

01:34:39.857 --> 01:34:42.235
They're trying to
fix the position of the radio.

01:34:48.241 --> 01:34:50.894
We'll wait a couple of minutes,
then start transmitting again.

01:34:50.994 --> 01:34:51.936
A couple of minutes?

01:34:52.036 --> 01:34:53.788
That means two minutes!

01:35:09.345 --> 01:35:10.346
Sam?

01:35:12.181 --> 01:35:13.524
I'm, uh...

01:35:14.058 --> 01:35:16.186
I'm very sorry about Monique.

01:35:17.103 --> 01:35:21.028
I never dreamt anything like this
would happen and I didn't...

01:35:25.069 --> 01:35:26.946
I met her and I liked her.

01:35:27.572 --> 01:35:31.543
Well, I was a little fed up
with those tramps at the Negresco Club.

01:35:35.246 --> 01:35:37.749
I'm not like you, Sam. That's all.

01:35:38.791 --> 01:35:40.088
In fact, I

01:35:40.793 --> 01:35:42.466
sort of envy you.

01:35:45.631 --> 01:35:48.100
I remember when I went to...

01:35:48.926 --> 01:35:51.975
Went to one of
the several colleges I attended.

01:35:53.014 --> 01:35:55.517
I was asked to join a fraternity...

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:57.543
One of those, uh, secret organizations

01:35:57.643 --> 01:35:59.504
where they give you a secret handshake,

01:35:59.604 --> 01:36:00.821
and then they

01:36:01.898 --> 01:36:05.534
bend you over and then paddle
your fanny till you can't sit down.

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:11.996
Well, I happened to overhear two of
my fraternity brothers talking one night.

01:36:12.283 --> 01:36:14.519
They were talking about me. One said...

01:36:14.619 --> 01:36:17.748
"Gee, that Britt.
Hmm, boy, he's got everything.

01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:19.274
"He's got looks,

01:36:19.374 --> 01:36:20.626
"money,

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:21.943
"personality,

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:23.135
"brains."

01:36:26.339 --> 01:36:28.157
And then... And then the other one said...

01:36:28.257 --> 01:36:31.511
"Yeah, that Britt, he's got everything,
except one thing.

01:36:32.804 --> 01:36:34.852
"He hasn't any character."

01:36:38.684 --> 01:36:40.732
Want to know something, Sam?

01:36:41.771 --> 01:36:43.114
He was right.

01:36:45.691 --> 01:36:47.819
I haven't any character.

01:36:49.612 --> 01:36:51.389
You're the kind of a guy,

01:36:51.489 --> 01:36:53.266
you see something you want very badly,

01:36:53.366 --> 01:36:55.101
you say to yourself,

01:36:55.201 --> 01:36:56.999
"Well, how badly do I want it?

01:36:57.286 --> 01:36:59.105
"Can I really afford it?

01:36:59.205 --> 01:37:01.754
"What do I have to give up to get it?"

01:37:02.834 --> 01:37:03.881
Me?

01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.363
I see something I want,

01:37:07.463 --> 01:37:08.931
I ask myself...

01:37:10.049 --> 01:37:12.643
"What do I have to say to get it?"

01:37:15.138 --> 01:37:16.685
And I say it.

01:37:20.059 --> 01:37:21.060
I...

01:37:26.023 --> 01:37:27.570
Sam, did you...

01:37:28.192 --> 01:37:30.136
Sam, did you hear what I said?

01:37:30.236 --> 01:37:31.909
Plug in, Sergeant.

01:37:33.573 --> 01:37:36.851
If you think I'm going to sit around here,
you're crazy.

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:40.104
You ain't going nowhere, buddy.
You're staying right here with me.

01:37:40.204 --> 01:37:42.523
And if you did get back,
and the chances are awful slim,

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:45.752
I'd see you got life in Leavenworth.
Now, plug in!

01:37:48.713 --> 01:37:49.947
From Checkpoint 9...

01:37:50.047 --> 01:37:51.449
One gun illuminating.

01:37:51.549 --> 01:37:52.825
Checkpoint 9...

01:37:52.925 --> 01:37:54.393
One gun illuminating.

01:37:59.056 --> 01:38:01.150
Fire direction was way off on that one.

01:38:02.268 --> 01:38:03.315
Correct your fire.

01:38:09.609 --> 01:38:11.886
No wonder they kicked out the civilians.

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.763
Look at the stuff they got in there.

01:38:13.863 --> 01:38:16.015
They've got enough stuff
to blow up the Alps!

01:38:16.115 --> 01:38:18.209
Or launch an offensive!

01:38:21.704 --> 01:38:23.422
What is it?

01:38:25.082 --> 01:38:26.818
They're evacuating the town.

01:38:26.918 --> 01:38:28.261
When?

01:38:30.922 --> 01:38:32.657
At 0400.

01:38:32.757 --> 01:38:34.634
It gives us about an hour.

01:38:35.051 --> 01:38:35.993
Fine!

01:38:36.093 --> 01:38:39.288
In an hour, we'll be in the woods watching
the biggest explosion you ever saw.

01:38:39.388 --> 01:38:42.267
That's cutting it a little,
uh, thin, isn't it?

01:38:43.392 --> 01:38:46.087
Tell 'em at 0400 I want everything
available. Everything!

01:38:46.187 --> 01:38:47.505
I wanna blow this joint right off the map!

01:38:47.605 --> 01:38:48.948
Listen.

01:38:49.065 --> 01:38:51.909
What are our chances
of getting out of here?

01:38:52.443 --> 01:38:53.444
Some.

01:38:58.783 --> 01:39:01.686
Checkpoint 2-8, supply dump in town.

01:39:01.786 --> 01:39:03.914
All available fire for effect

01:39:04.205 --> 01:39:05.627
at 0400.

01:39:06.624 --> 01:39:08.126
Over and out!

01:39:55.881 --> 01:39:56.882
Ahh!

01:39:57.508 --> 01:39:58.509
Ahh!

01:39:58.968 --> 01:40:01.096
Amerikaner!

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.438
Amerikaner!

01:40:30.374 --> 01:40:34.129
They're moving out right away.
They're not waiting for 0400.

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:48.150
Halt!

01:40:49.602 --> 01:40:50.728
Sam!

01:40:50.853 --> 01:40:52.105
Sam!

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.180
Brit!

01:41:33.479 --> 01:41:34.463
Oh.

01:41:36.982 --> 01:41:39.531
You thinking about Monique now, Britt?

01:41:41.237 --> 01:41:43.160
You sorry now, Britt?

01:41:48.536 --> 01:41:50.004
It's too damn late now, Britt.

01:41:51.622 --> 01:41:53.124
It's too late.

01:41:55.501 --> 01:41:57.845
You're going to be all right, Sarge.

01:41:58.796 --> 01:42:00.798
You're going to be fine.

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.107
You know,

01:42:12.435 --> 01:42:14.563
there's no satisfaction.

01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:02.385
Don't wait for 0400! Don't wait for 0400!

01:43:02.485 --> 01:43:04.095
They're getting out! They're moving out!

01:43:04.195 --> 01:43:06.289
Give 'em everything you've got,
on the double, quick!

01:43:09.742 --> 01:43:11.369
I'm on my way out.

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:14.792
I'm all right.

01:43:48.656 --> 01:43:50.766
When my outﬁt got
into the rubble the next day,

01:43:50.866 --> 01:43:53.018
they found 13 people still breathing...

01:43:53.118 --> 01:43:55.020
Twelve Germans and me,

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.339
or what was left of me.

01:44:03.754 --> 01:44:06.553
I was in the hospital in Paris
for seven months.

01:44:07.758 --> 01:44:12.184
When I got out, I had $4,967 in back pay,

01:44:13.681 --> 01:44:15.934
and I was one of the displaced.

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:21.739
I'd had two letters from Monique
while I was in the hospital.

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.990
"Dear friend," the ﬁrst one began.

01:44:24.108 --> 01:44:25.885
"I think of you often."

01:44:25.985 --> 01:44:29.346
And at the end, she added,
almost as an afterthought,

01:44:29.446 --> 01:44:32.141
"I have met a soldier
named Harmer in Nice.

01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:34.685
"He said that Britt Harris was dead."

01:44:34.785 --> 01:44:36.503
That was all.

01:44:36.912 --> 01:44:39.290
I was glad she could write it like that.

01:44:39.832 --> 01:44:42.255
The second letter was also short.

01:44:42.626 --> 01:44:45.675
It merely said that her mother
had died the week of VE Day.

01:44:46.922 --> 01:44:48.866
I didn't answer the letters. I...

01:44:48.966 --> 01:44:51.139
I didn't really know what to say.

01:45:00.185 --> 01:45:02.563
And then one afternoon
as I took my ﬁrst sip

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:05.341
of what must have been my 2,000th beer,

01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:08.820
I saw myself in the ring
the glass left on the table.

01:45:08.986 --> 01:45:11.388
I realized then that I'd known
guys like me

01:45:11.488 --> 01:45:13.474
left over from the ﬁrst war.

01:45:13.574 --> 01:45:15.768
They got shot up
at the Battle of the Meuse

01:45:15.868 --> 01:45:19.168
and spent the next 20 years
brooding about it. I'd had it.

01:45:23.876 --> 01:45:26.904
I went to the American Express
and sent a cable to my partner...

01:45:27.004 --> 01:45:28.989
"Reporting back three weeks from today.

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:32.013
"Meantime, taking small
sentimental journey."

01:45:34.011 --> 01:45:36.730
The next morning I was in Villefranche.

01:45:57.868 --> 01:45:59.711
Merci, monsieur.

01:46:13.050 --> 01:46:15.098
Are you the lieutenant of the top?

01:46:15.844 --> 01:46:17.391
I am,

01:46:19.056 --> 01:46:21.479
and you are Jean-Francois Duvan!

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.585
Tsk-tsk.

01:46:22.685 --> 01:46:23.627
You've grown.

01:46:23.727 --> 01:46:25.570
I have become taller.

01:46:26.063 --> 01:46:27.565
Yes, you have.

01:46:32.403 --> 01:46:34.030
And you have lost one arm.

01:46:35.739 --> 01:46:38.434
So I have. I've never even missed it.

01:46:38.534 --> 01:46:40.912
But one is enough for anybody, and beside,

01:46:41.078 --> 01:46:43.672
the Army's going to make me
a brand new one.

01:46:43.872 --> 01:46:46.170
Does the mademoiselle know you are here?

01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:48.006
No.

01:46:55.467 --> 01:46:57.094
I will find her.

01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:47.653
Hello, Sam.

01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:49.772
How are you, friend?

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:53.258
I was sorry to hear about your mother.

01:47:53.358 --> 01:47:55.452
Oh, she had a very good life.

01:47:56.487 --> 01:47:57.613
What is all of this?

01:47:58.072 --> 01:47:59.540
Oh, it is recess.

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.393
All of this is a school for children

01:48:02.493 --> 01:48:05.497
whose parents have been killed by the war.

01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:08.753
On the first day they are here,

01:48:09.124 --> 01:48:11.923
I remind them of something
my mother told me.

01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:14.196
She said,

01:48:14.296 --> 01:48:17.516
"Everyone in the world
has some kind of a burden,

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:19.576
"but

01:48:19.676 --> 01:48:21.974
"it is not the burden that's important.

01:48:22.846 --> 01:48:24.940
"It's how you carry it."

01:48:31.355 --> 01:48:32.572
Are you happy?

01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:34.816
Sometimes,

01:48:35.025 --> 01:48:36.527
like most people.

01:48:38.237 --> 01:48:40.660
Let me show you our classroom.

01:48:50.207 --> 01:48:51.834
Silence, s'il vous plait.

01:48:54.002 --> 01:48:55.800
Today we have a visitor,

01:48:56.046 --> 01:48:57.548
an American.

01:48:58.006 --> 01:48:59.804
His name is Lieutenant...

01:49:00.092 --> 01:49:01.184
No,

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.182
Captain Sam Loggins.

01:49:05.055 --> 01:49:06.540
In his honor,

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.937
we shall sing a song.

01:49:08.934 --> 01:49:10.878
Sous le ciel de Paris.

01:49:10.978 --> 01:49:12.046
Sous le ciel de Paris.

01:49:12.146 --> 01:49:14.569
Oui! Oui! Oui, oui, oui!

01:49:15.305 --> 01:49:21.918
