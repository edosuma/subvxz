WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.269
<i> Previously on</i> this is us...
I wanted to be the man

00:04.271 --> 00:05.371
that made you happy.
From here on out,

00:05.373 --> 00:07.373
I'm gonna be a 12 for you.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.441
You are getting
in the car right now,

00:09.443 --> 00:12.277
and we are going to this
doctors appointment.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.113
Hi, white people.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.280
I don't know what you were
looking for with all this,

00:16.283 --> 00:18.450
but I do know you don't
have a whole lot of time.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.652
I'd like to tell
the girls who you are.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.954
I was not a very good
brother to you, was I?

00:21.956 --> 00:22.955
No, you weren't.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.690
But you still got time.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.858
Toby.
Kate.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.159
How's your breakfast?
You mean this, uh,

00:27.161 --> 00:29.194
steel-cut oatmeal
and egg-white pancake

00:29.196 --> 00:30.863
you're making me eat?
It's amazing.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.132
I'm gonna do theater.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.400
I did it-- i-i-

00:34.402 --> 00:35.734
<i> I booked a redeye to New York.</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:40.239
It's a scorcher out there,
folks.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.807
Stay cool, Pittsburgh.
- Shut up.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.308
Don't tell me
to shut up.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.410
You're doing it wrong.
No, I'm not.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.645
Yes, you are.
Mom, I'm hot.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.548
I know, kiddo. Dad is trying
to fix the air conditioning.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.051
Babe, how's it going?
We're dying in here.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.052
I'm working on it.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.086
Give it back!

00:54.088 --> 00:55.888
Just hold on.
Enough!

00:55.890 --> 00:57.423
Mom, Randall took
my rubik's cube.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.558
You weren't doing it right.
Enough. Come here.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.194
Wow. You did this?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.996
You're supposed to be
yelling at him!

01:03.998 --> 01:05.497
Randall,
stop scratching.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.166
That's a rash, babe.
You're gonna make it worse.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.435
Okay, I think
i have a solution.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.271
Is it fixed? Jack, what...
What are you doing

01:12.273 --> 01:14.106
wearing that shirt?
You know I hate that shirt.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.676
I'm wearing this shirt because
it makes me think of fun.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.378
It makes me think
of sun.

01:19.380 --> 01:24.216
And because we are
going to the pool! Huh?

01:24.218 --> 01:26.185
Kate Pearson,
you get in here

01:26.187 --> 01:28.020
and you strut your stuff,
young lady.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.556
That's right.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.125
Care bears.
You know it, you know it.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.027
Today, people,
we are gonna debut

01:35.029 --> 01:37.396
the brand-new
care bear bikini!

01:37.398 --> 01:39.231
Can we go
to the greenview pool?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.600
The one with the diving board?
<i> Please.</i>

01:41.602 --> 01:42.935
No, that place sucks.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.270
You barely get
in anyway.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.440
The big three.
Your brother needs you.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.475
Come on, you big mope.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.542
Don't hold out
on us.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.077
Please. Please.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.413
Okay, okay, yes.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.614
Go get your swimsuits on.
Go get your suits.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.783
Come on,
towels, towels.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.451
Ac is zonked, babe, we're
gonna have to call someone.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.820
Pool, huh?
Not a movie?

02:01.822 --> 02:03.922
Are you sure you're okay
with the pool today.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.092
We're gonna have
a day-long pool vacation.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.660
I'm gonna snag us

02:08.662 --> 02:10.795
not one, not two,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.431
but five pool chairs.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.832
Five?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.434
I'm gonna snag us
five pool chairs.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.970
You bad man.
Yes, I am.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.438
The kids are gonna
run off,

02:19.440 --> 02:20.973
you're gonna finish
that book you've been

02:20.975 --> 02:22.975
trying to read
for two years.
It's <i> misery.</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:24.610
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.945
No, no, no, the book
is <i> misery,</i> by Stephen king.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.447
Oh, yeah, right.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.182
Hey, I already packed
the cooler.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.351
All soft drinks,
no beer.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.820
A whole day at the pool
with those kids and no beer?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.155
I told you,
i stopped drinking.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.589
It's not you
I'm worried about.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.958
See?
That's what we need, then.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.327
We just need a day
to relax.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.333
A reminder, there is no running,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.669
no diving, and absolutely
no glass containers

02:50.671 --> 02:52.004
in the pool area.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.606
Feeling relaxed yet?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.946
There's a chair!

03:02.283 --> 03:03.282
Run, run, run, run,
run, run, run.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.050
Go get it!
Get it, yes!

03:05.052 --> 03:06.818
Get it, get it, get it.
Yeah!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.954
Ow.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.822
Oh, stop it.
That doesn't hurt.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.324
Ow!
- Oh, that one might've hurt.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.126
Sorry. Gotcha.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.227
I want grandpa to do mine.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.162
No problem, miss Annie.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.630
Oh, really? You want
grandpa to try

03:18.632 --> 03:19.898
to tame this mess?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.234
Have at it.
Let's see here.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.536
Oh, that's gotta go.
Beth, where's your scissors?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.138
No!

03:26.140 --> 03:29.141
Then you better sit still
and not give me a hard time.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.143
How'd you get
that scar?

03:31.145 --> 03:33.745
Oh, that?
Rock, bottle...

03:33.747 --> 03:35.647
Eh, there were plenty
in the air that day.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.815
Maybe we don't tell
that story.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.850
Oh, no, it's not
a bad one.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.385
Some people in Pittsburgh
were fighting against bussing,

03:40.387 --> 03:42.588
and I was helping out
with that.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.089
'86, '87?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.390
What's bussing?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.992
Getting poor children
into the schools

03:46.994 --> 03:48.327
in better neighborhoods.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.328
You were working
with the urban league?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.330
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.733
Look, I gotta get
on my walk.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.168
You wanna take over here?

03:56.170 --> 03:57.236
Mm-hmm.
Mwah!

03:58.872 --> 04:00.906
Okay, you two,
let's get moving.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.341
Mom and I gotta
get to work

04:02.343 --> 04:04.076
so we can pay for
all this hair product.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.582
Hey, hey!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.184
<i> The eagle has landed.</i>
-<i> What's up?</i>

04:12.186 --> 04:15.754
I'm officially
a new yorker now-- east coast!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.055
Hey, somebody wants
to say hi.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.958
Uncle Kevin,
come see my play.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.059
I'm snow white.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.628
You're kidding me!

04:22.630 --> 04:24.296
Snow white's my favorite
character of all time!

04:24.298 --> 04:26.131
I'm actually auditioning
for a play, too.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.200
Yeah, it's very dark,
very, very truthful--

04:28.202 --> 04:30.736
do the Manny voice.
What's that?

04:30.738 --> 04:31.870
They love it when
you do the catchphrase.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.972
I don't want to do
the Manny voice.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.374
Please.
Please.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.143
Baby say what?
Like, for real.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.445
Baby say what?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.047
No, like in the show.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.084
Baby say <i> what?</i>

04:49.723 --> 04:52.090
Your biggest fans.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.925
Any... anyway, this play is
a total departure for me,

04:53.927 --> 04:55.160
you know?

04:55.162 --> 04:56.628
None of that, like,
Manny stuff.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.831
It's a character-driven
departure for me.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.167
Where'd you go?
What are you looking at?

05:02.169 --> 05:04.002
Uh, hey, man, uh,
i gotta go.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.839
You're just gonna
hang up on him?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.242
No, no, no, I will not
show you my I.D.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.611
Not until you tell me why
you need a reason to see it.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tony,
what's going on here?

05:15.082 --> 05:17.482
Hey, Mr. Pearson. We had
a report of someone loitering.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.817
I wasn't loitering.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.519
I was taking my walk,
and literally

05:20.521 --> 05:22.087
on my way to smell
the roses,

05:22.089 --> 05:24.156
as I have been
for the past week.
I know.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.024
Is there some local rose
smelling ordinance

05:26.026 --> 05:27.359
I'm not aware of?
William, enough.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.527
Enough...

05:28.529 --> 05:29.828
He's with you, sir?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.496
Yeah, he's staying with us.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.067
Sorry.
Sorry?

05:36.170 --> 05:37.336
We're so sorry.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.271
We didn't know,
Randall.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.672
Understood.
Thanks.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.074
Thank you, Tony.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.914
We're gonna get you
some new clothes.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.353
I hate kale.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.021
Me, too.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.357
Ick.

05:58.359 --> 06:01.693
Baby arugula is just as bad
as grown-up arugula.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.696
All right, you know what?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.299
Here we go.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.500
Oh, no, no, no.
Let me get--

06:08.502 --> 06:11.336
remember, you are
unemployed.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.171
And I am not convinced
that you would do well

06:13.173 --> 06:15.307
begging for money.
Are you kidding?

06:15.309 --> 06:16.808
You don't think the drivers
will be sympathetic to me

06:16.810 --> 06:18.310
holding up a sign
that says "hungry?"

06:18.312 --> 06:20.078
That's good.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.714
I'm gonna use the restroom,
and then we'll go, okay?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.422
Hi.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.426
Hi.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.994
How are you?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.997
Uh, good.
How are you?
Good.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.005
Okay, uh... you wanna
get out of here?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.674
Who was that?
Who was... uh...

06:49.676 --> 06:52.611
You saw that. Uh,
that was my ex-wife.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.185
Wait, are you serious?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.421
Uh, yeah. I told you
i was married before.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.858
Not to that.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074

07:23.410 --> 07:26.745
supermodel, pose...
And catwalk.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.648
Hey, Kate,
stop being silly.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.782
Come over here, please.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.288
Oh, Samantha and Vicki
are here!

07:36.290 --> 07:38.623
Care bears!
- Okay, that's two.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.258
Babe, I had to sleep
with someone to get this one.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.893
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.495
As long as his wife
is okay with it.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.497
Kevin, you're up, please.
Shirt off.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.832
Why? I don't even
like swimming.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.733
You don't have to
put your face in.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.902
You can sit in the shallow end
and Randall will stay with you.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.137
I don't like Randall either.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.171
Hey, kev, come on.
- Enough.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.506
Turn around.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.676
Randall, you're up, please.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.979
Come here.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.148
Turn around, please.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.317
Are you sure I really
need sunscreen?

08:06.753 --> 08:07.786
Yes, absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.020
Of course you do. Sure.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.923
Okay, look, big three,
come here.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.959
Come here. You are
surrounded by adults

08:13.961 --> 08:16.027
and lifeguards
that resemble adults.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.696
There's very little trouble
you can actually get into--

08:17.698 --> 08:19.464
wait, wait.
Kate, baby,

08:19.466 --> 08:21.500
are you sure you don't
want to put a shirt on?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.602
Right.
Here.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.504
Enjoy your <i> misery.</i>

08:25.506 --> 08:27.539
People are staring at her
in that bathing suit, Jack.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.808
Some jerky little kid
is gonna say something.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.710
It's baby fat.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.977
She's only eight years old.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.446
Kids haven't
turned mean yet.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.780
And what is up
with Kevin lately,

08:35.782 --> 08:37.282
and that attitude?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.284
He's so jealous of Randall.
He's fine.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.818
Babe, he's fine.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.288
They are all fine.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.023
And does Randall
need sunscreen?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.391
I mean, have we just been
wasting sunscreen

08:46.393 --> 08:47.659
all of these years?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.361
That I have
no answer for.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.730
Chair. Chair!

08:51.732 --> 08:52.797
Careful!

08:54.801 --> 08:57.202
<i> She's his ex-wife, Kate.</i>

08:57.204 --> 08:59.004
All right? The operative
word being "ex."

08:59.006 --> 09:00.872
They're not together anymore.
He's with you now.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.141
"Why?" Is the question.
You should see her.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.876
Maybe that's what
Toby wants.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.978
Maybe he's fulfilling
a fat-girl fetish with me.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.979
Well, that's actually
a thing.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.381
Of course, for me it was

09:09.383 --> 09:10.515
more of a phase
than a thing, but anyway...

09:10.517 --> 09:12.150
I did a deep dive
with this woman.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.685
Everything reeks fabulous.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.221
She has fabulous taste,
she has fabulous friends.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.857
She's been to Argentina, Kevin!

09:18.859 --> 09:20.559
Listen to me, I did not
leave you in Los Angeles

09:20.561 --> 09:22.093
so you could self-sabotage,
okay?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.229
So get off the Internet--
do that right now--

09:24.231 --> 09:26.698
and tell me how hard
I'm gonna crush this audition.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.568
The edges are gone...

09:29.570 --> 09:32.070
And then the thing.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.672
Thank you, Sean Patrick.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.709
Some good choices,
i thought.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.611
It's Daniel.
Everyone else sucks.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.079
You know,
i kind of liked--

09:41.081 --> 09:42.113
it's Daniel.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.750
Hold on, hold on.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.953
We have one more.
Kevin Pearson.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.254
Sorry. I know, I know.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.122
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm late.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.424
It's just, you know, I tried
to take the subway, right,

09:52.426 --> 09:53.758
and then walk,
like a new yorker.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.961
Uh, Ron shiller.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.896
This is sloane Sandberg.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.599
You're the, uh, screenwriter.
Playwright.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.702
Well, you know, I mean,
you gotta start somewhere.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.204
Um, you'll be reading
with miss Maine today,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.539
if that's okay.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.707
Yeah, no, whatever
you got, you know.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.975
Miss Maine, miss Iowa.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.910
I judged, uh, miss usa
for trump once,

10:11.912 --> 10:13.712
so we may have
actually met before.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.314
Miss Maine is
Olivia Maine.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.083
Tony nominee.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.086
She plays Jessica.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.487
Of course. Hi.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.688
Good to meet you.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.893
Uh, well, before we start,
i just wanted to...

10:28.895 --> 10:30.261
I want to get something
off my chest.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.464
I do understand
the perception, you know.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.965
These L.A. actors,
they come out here, right?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.434
They do their little
quick stint in theater

10:36.436 --> 10:37.602
just to feel better
about themselves.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.737
That's not why I'm here, okay?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.505
I'm here for the right reasons.

10:42.509 --> 10:45.143
Let's get this
over with, shall we?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.156
Did you want me to start?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.025
Yes, I thought it
would be good, if, uh...

11:00.027 --> 11:02.994
You speak, then I speak, then
you speak, and we all go home.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.096
Does that work for you?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.698
Yeah. That's great...

11:14.207 --> 11:17.442
My recollection's hazy,
actually, it was a long day.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.111
Not for me. Mine was over
before 9:00 in the morning.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.313
That's really good... accent.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.115
What?
The American accent.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.450
What?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.885
I just...

11:26.887 --> 11:28.720
Diving... diving
right back in. Uh ...

11:32.292 --> 11:34.526
It say, uh... it says
"i lay," uh, I don't...

11:34.528 --> 11:36.795
Let me just say... I don't need
to say it. It says...

11:36.797 --> 11:38.163
I'll just say it.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.065
I lay...

11:40.067 --> 11:41.966
Just keep going.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.968
This is...

11:43.970 --> 11:45.870
I'll get it.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.306
I lay on the dock all night,

11:48.308 --> 11:50.141
and part of the next morning.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.776
And I don't feel a thing.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.346
Let me take that again.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.849
Oh, my gosh... oh, my gosh.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.485
Okay. Baby say what...

12:00.487 --> 12:04.255
Okay. I-i lay...
Let me get into it.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.492
I lay on the dock all night
and part of the next morning.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.661
And I don't feel a thing.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.897
The bug bites,
the sunburn. Nothin'.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.333
It's like when we used
to go fishing. You remember?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.842
I never fished...
Do you have the next...

12:23.844 --> 12:25.744
What the hell?
Sorry.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.045
You weren't talking,
so I thought...

12:27.047 --> 12:28.947
It's called a pause.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.415
Right.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.919
Sorry. It doesn't say
pause on my script...

12:34.921 --> 12:36.788
Well, it doesn't say suck,
either, yet here we are.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.960
You know your size?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.595
Always tended toward the slim.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.063
I don't see that changing much

12:45.065 --> 12:47.499
at this point.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.603
Try these.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.738
Afterwards, we'll swing
by the pharmacy,

12:53.740 --> 12:56.541
get those medications that
the doctor wrote for you.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.409
Sounds like a plan.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.712
Ugh! $100?

13:00.714 --> 13:02.781
It's what they cost.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.050
I'm paying, just take the pants.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.460
So are we gonna talk
about it or not?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.795
Talk about what?

13:16.797 --> 13:19.764
Ha. About what.
Uh, this morning.

13:19.766 --> 13:23.234
Or are you content to stand in
silent judgment with that face?

13:23.236 --> 13:24.769
It's just my face.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.405
No, you didn't like me
apologizing for you.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.907
I get it.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.176
Would you have been happier
if I made a big scene?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.744
You know, got up in Tony's face,

13:32.746 --> 13:35.013
had the cops roll up
and turn the hoses on us?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.415
It's the cosgroves.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.351
He runs an insurance agency,
she collects owls.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.154
History would not have
memorialized our stand.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.489
You ever had a hose
turned on you?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.990
Can't say that I have,
I'm very sorry.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.159
Don't be. It hurts.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.828
And there's that face.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.863
Only face I got.
Look, I could use some socks...

13:51.865 --> 13:54.132
No, the face. The one
that says I have a scar

13:54.134 --> 13:56.201
on my arm from
integrating schools.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.970
And probably blisters on your
feet from marching for freedom,

13:58.972 --> 14:01.506
but me, because I grew up
in a white house,

14:01.508 --> 14:04.042
you think I don't live
in a black man's world.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.643
Oh, you know the one.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.112
The one where that salesman
there has been eyeballing us

14:08.114 --> 14:10.381
ever since we came in here.
Or where that security guard

14:10.383 --> 14:11.449
has moved just a little

14:11.451 --> 14:13.051
off his mark so he can
keep us in his sight.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.652
And where they'll definitely ask

14:14.654 --> 14:16.855
for an ID with my credit card
when I go to pay,

14:16.857 --> 14:19.224
even though they haven't
asked for anybody else's.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.059
Plus a million
things every day

14:21.061 --> 14:24.128
that I have to <i> choose</i> to let go,

14:24.130 --> 14:27.866
just so I'm not
pissed off all the time.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.968
Like I did on the street
this morning.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.071
Like I have done
every day of my life.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.176
Now try on the damn
slim cut flat front chinos.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.479
I think they'll
look nice on you.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.656
Randall!
Yeah?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.157
Watch!

14:53.159 --> 14:55.894
Cool! Cool!

14:55.896 --> 14:58.529
Dad, watch! Dad!

14:58.531 --> 15:00.064
Where's the other one?
I'm looking.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.833
Man, you take your
eyes off one for

15:01.835 --> 15:03.534
a second, you lose track
of the others.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.836
That's because
there are more of them

15:04.838 --> 15:06.070
than there are of us.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.105
Always will be.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.406
What? Oh.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.774
Talking about the kids.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.243
Yep. It's a war.
They got the numbers.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.178
Dad! Dad!
We were beat before we started.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.780
Watch!
There she is.
Oh.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.015
Hi. Hey, guys.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.349
You want to play mermaids?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.151
This is from all of us.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.189
Dad!

15:25.191 --> 15:27.625
Dad! Daddy! Dad!
Yep.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.127
Dad, watch me!

15:29.129 --> 15:30.395
Yeah. I see you, pal!

15:30.397 --> 15:31.896
Do you remember
the first time

15:31.898 --> 15:33.965
he said "dad"?
How happy I was?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.433
Now where's Randall?

15:35.435 --> 15:38.102
How about that time?
Did you see?

15:38.104 --> 15:39.470
Hey, kev. Where's your brother?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.805
I don't know!

15:40.807 --> 15:41.906
Jack...

15:41.908 --> 15:43.207
You take land, I'll take sea.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.910
Dad! Watch!

15:45.912 --> 15:47.445
Kevin.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.213
You were supposed
to watch each other!

15:49.215 --> 15:51.416
Randall!

15:51.418 --> 15:54.352
Randall!

15:57.424 --> 15:59.757
<i> Aw, Kate it was</i>
<i> the worst audition</i>

15:59.759 --> 16:01.993
in the history of the world.
Okay? I mean, that woman

16:01.995 --> 16:03.828
made me so nervous, I started
doing an English accent

16:03.830 --> 16:05.630
in the middle of it
for no reason!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.665
Okay, I'm sure it
wasn't <i> that bad.</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:09.267
Maybe that's the problem.
You know?

16:09.269 --> 16:10.935
I wanted it too much.
Hey! It's the man-NY!

16:10.937 --> 16:12.503
Hey man-NY! How's it going?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.172
Yeah. Listen. Could you
please fly out here?

16:14.174 --> 16:15.673
I really need you right now.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.109
You'll be fine, you just...

16:18.111 --> 16:20.244
What? I'm just what?
Where'd you go?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.846
Nowhere. I'm here.
I'm shopping.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.514
I'm lost.
- You're not lost.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.283
It's just all new.
It's just new.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.152
No... I mean I'm actually lost,

16:28.154 --> 16:30.455
I have no idea where the hell
I'm at. I got to go.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.756
Oh!
Ow!

16:31.758 --> 16:33.825
Sorry. Oh.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.661
Hey, uh...

16:36.663 --> 16:38.763
That whole thing back
there, just so you know.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.631
I'm not actually bad, okay?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.033
Okay. Duly noted.
Okay.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.301
Okay. Just wanted
to get that out there.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.936
Well, out there it is.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.005
Although you weren't
super helpful.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.510
You want to get a drink?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.112
What, like, now?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.614
Yeah. Now.
Come on,

16:56.616 --> 16:58.549
L.A.
what? Yeah.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.891
<i>Mom, the play's about to start!</i>

17:06.893 --> 17:09.359
All right, Tess. Hurry up.
Go get your dress on.
Get her her shoes.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.528
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Break a leg.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.864
Come on...

17:12.866 --> 17:15.366
Wow, this is a nice place.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.635
Yeah. Public schools
in this area are good,

17:17.637 --> 17:18.736
it's why we moved here.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.338
Even better than private.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.507
Mm-hmm.
You know, the parents
are real involved.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.709
Mm-hmm.
You know, Beth's on the board.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.978
Real involved.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.414
They got a farm.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.582
Really?
Yeah. Out back.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.552
Kids learn about the land.
Grow their own food.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.088
Thank you.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.424
They got, uh, chickens.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.392
They got a goat.

17:42.862 --> 17:47.098
* Wanna take it down,
gonna do my thing *

17:47.100 --> 17:49.867
* gonna do my thing *

17:49.869 --> 17:52.703
* gonna do
my thing *

17:52.705 --> 17:54.072
* gonna do my thing *

17:54.074 --> 17:55.940
hi.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.176
Can I help you find something?

17:58.178 --> 17:59.243
No.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.245
Oh! You're here about the job.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.381
Hmm?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.549
You know. The job?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.050
Y-yeah.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.351
Great!

18:07.353 --> 18:08.786
* I'm unstoppable *

18:08.788 --> 18:11.456
let's go over here
so we can talk.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.158
* It's time to hit
the road again. *

18:21.634 --> 18:24.435
Randall?
Ugh... Randall.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.470
Hey,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.572
Kate. Have you seen Randall?

18:27.574 --> 18:29.474
Randall!

18:45.291 --> 18:47.325
Randall?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.960
Randall...

18:50.630 --> 18:52.964
Randall! Hello!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.432
Did you not hear me calling you?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.434
Hey, what are you
doing over here?
Oh, no, no, no...

18:56.436 --> 18:58.636
I've been...
It's okay.
I'm watching him.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.404
Okay, it's... i-i have
him now. I'm sorry,

19:00.406 --> 19:02.507
I'm his mother. I was a
little panicked. I'm Rebecca.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.774
Oh, we know who you are.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.076
You do?

19:05.078 --> 19:07.311
Oh yes. When a white
family has a black child

19:07.313 --> 19:09.580
and they don't introduce
themselves to any of us,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.582
we tend to take notice.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.586
Well. Thank you
for watching him,

19:15.588 --> 19:17.855
he's just not
supposed to be over here.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.826
Not... "Over here" like that.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.096
There's nothing wrong
with over here.

19:25.098 --> 19:29.167
I just mean that I want him
where we can see him.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.868
Where we're sitting.
In front of us.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.837
Thank you. It was very nice
to meet you.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.172
Randall, come on. Let's go.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.374
Come on. Thank you.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.944
Actually,

19:39.946 --> 19:41.979
you stay right here.

19:41.981 --> 19:45.116
That's my son,
and I'm his mother.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.518
And I don't know if you have
some sort of problem
with that arrangement,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.053
but also, I don't really care.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.022
Thank you very much
for watching my son.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.290
But I have him now.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.025
Okay.
Okay.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.394
You need to get the child
a proper haircut.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.830
The razor bumps on his neck.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.633
You need a barber who knows
how to cut black hair.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.237
Come on.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.639
Hey, I told you to stay with
your brother. Didn't I?

20:08.641 --> 20:10.374
Sorry.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.843
Is this the real reason you
wanted to come to this pool

20:12.845 --> 20:14.545
and not the other?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.814
Come on.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.866
So beautiful.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.269
Ho, there. Who might you be,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.337
fair maid?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.205
I am the princess snow white.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.543
I have traveled this land

20:45.545 --> 20:48.379
and many others,
and never have I seen

20:48.381 --> 20:50.681
a beauty so fair.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.251
Where are you from,

20:53.253 --> 20:54.418
noble sir?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.753
What errand brings you

20:55.755 --> 20:57.054
to the forest?

20:59.292 --> 21:01.292
I come from a land far away.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.772
thanks.
Cheers.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.077
The, uh...
Thank you.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.145
...that play is really special,
isn't it?

21:21.147 --> 21:22.947
I mean, I don't read
a lot of plays,

21:22.949 --> 21:24.915
but that's-that's good.
- Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.584
No, look, it's...

21:26.586 --> 21:27.818
It's really good,

21:27.820 --> 21:29.553
actually.
I mean, it's...

21:29.555 --> 21:30.788
It's fragile.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.356
It's-it's delicate.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.395
So, where are you from,
Kevin Pearson?

21:37.397 --> 21:38.629
Me?
Mm.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.298
Uh... Pittsburgh, originally.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.066
You got family back there?

21:42.068 --> 21:44.969
Um... not anymore.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.971
Right, so, L.A. is home now?

21:48.508 --> 21:49.840
Yeah, I guess so.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.076
Yeah.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.911
I think you should
go back there.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.680
I know, right?

21:58.117 --> 21:59.250
Are you serious?

21:59.252 --> 22:01.619
I am serious.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.121
And I'm telling you
this as a friend

22:04.123 --> 22:06.257
because I see
this all the time.

22:06.259 --> 22:08.426
I mean, you said it yourself.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.028
Pretty people come here
from TV or movies

22:11.030 --> 22:12.763
because they want to do
something real.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.964
I mean, even if they've...

22:13.966 --> 22:16.000
They've never had
a genuine moment

22:16.002 --> 22:18.302
in their entire lives.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.271
Do you know what they find out?

22:20.273 --> 22:21.806
That guess what?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.541
It's hard.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.975
It's so hard.

22:24.977 --> 22:25.976
It's not...

22:25.978 --> 22:27.111
It's not pretend,

22:27.113 --> 22:28.713
it's not <i> guys and dolls</i>

22:28.715 --> 22:30.114
in some high school
cafeteria.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.949
It's not...

22:31.951 --> 22:33.851
I'm sorry, what-what-what
was the-the movie you were in?

22:34.821 --> 22:36.387
It was a TV show, actually,

22:36.389 --> 22:37.688
called, uh,<i> the man-NY.</i>

22:37.690 --> 22:38.956
Yeah, and look,

22:38.958 --> 22:39.957
I'm not saying that

22:39.959 --> 22:40.958
you're not good at what you do.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.959
I'm sure you're...

22:41.961 --> 22:43.027
You're great at it.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.562
I mean, i-i couldn't do it.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.398
But this...
Is not that.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.567
You're in over your head,

22:49.569 --> 22:50.668
Kevin Pearson.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.136
I mean, if you really want

22:52.138 --> 22:53.838
to do this, then go home,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.240
find a class,
get some training.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.009
I'm just being honest.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.345
I see.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.480
As a... as a friend.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.514
Yeah.
Yeah.

23:04.851 --> 23:05.983
Still, just, you know,
it feels like

23:05.985 --> 23:07.051
you're using the word
"friend" wrong.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.390
Everything all right?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.158
You okay?
Yeah.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.192
Yeah?

23:15.194 --> 23:17.361
Yeah.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.497
You got the part.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.765
Wait, I'm sorry, what?
They think the nanny

23:20.767 --> 23:22.600
will sell tickets.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.707
It was actually <i> the man-NY.</i>

23:29.709 --> 23:31.175
Dad, look!

23:31.177 --> 23:32.676
I'm going under and everything!

23:32.678 --> 23:33.711
Dad!

23:33.713 --> 23:35.913
Yeah, I see you, pal!
Randall.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.381
Dad!
Lunch, baby.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.716
Dad!
You know,
maybe she was just

23:38.718 --> 23:40.017
trying to be helpful.
- Dad! Watch!

23:40.019 --> 23:41.285
By condescendingly

23:41.287 --> 23:43.087
telling me how I could
raise my kid? Yeah.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.388
No, thank you.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.623
Dad!

23:55.468 --> 23:57.568
* I love my father
and I love him well... *

24:00.039 --> 24:04.341
* I hope to see him
someday soon *

24:06.279 --> 24:09.480
* I love my father
and I love him well *

24:11.784 --> 24:15.152
* I hope to see him
someday soon *

24:17.990 --> 24:19.757
* 'cause where I live *

24:19.759 --> 24:21.959
* it gets dark at night *

24:24.564 --> 24:28.799
* the kind of dark eats up
the light *

24:28.801 --> 24:31.435
* yeah, where I live *

24:31.437 --> 24:33.471
* it gets dark at night *

24:35.575 --> 24:40.077
* the kind of dark eats up
the light *

24:41.781 --> 24:43.247
* and you know that, mother *

24:43.249 --> 24:49.520
* I'd be lying *

24:49.522 --> 24:53.023
* if I didn't tell you
I'm afraid of night. *

25:32.064 --> 25:34.031
We have a lost child,
looking for its parents.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.000
If you are missing a child,

25:36.002 --> 25:38.402
please call lost and found.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.414
Kate, you're not eating.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.349
You okay?

25:52.351 --> 25:54.118
What's up with her?

25:59.725 --> 26:02.860
Are you kidding me?!
Oh! Why?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.562
Because we didn't make her
wear a t-shirt, that's why.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.830
No, no, Jack, you're only
gonna make it worse.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.098
Sit...

26:08.100 --> 26:09.533
Sit down. Seriously.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.768
I almost drowned!

26:10.770 --> 26:12.202
What?
Did you even care?

26:12.204 --> 26:13.571
When?
I tried to get
to the deep end,

26:13.573 --> 26:15.406
but you never watch me.
Hey. Calm down.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.674
You always watch them.
Kev, kev, kev.

26:16.676 --> 26:17.908
Come on...
Don't touch me.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.276
Watch yourself, pal.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.878
And you're so busy making sure

26:20.880 --> 26:22.112
that Kate's not
eating too much...

26:22.114 --> 26:23.447
Kev, calm down.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.282
...and... and Randall's
not too adopted,

26:25.284 --> 26:27.084
and meanwhile,
where's Kevin?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.285
Oh, guess what?

26:28.287 --> 26:30.354
He's dead.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.222
- Bud, we love you. We were watching...
- Don't touch me.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.257
I got this one.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.458
Hey, hey, hey,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.360
hey, come here.
Come here.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.394
What?
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.696
I'm sorry.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.797
Okay? I should
have been watching.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.365
Okay?
You should have.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.067
And I said I was and I should
have been watching you, pal.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.234
I'm trying, okay?

26:44.236 --> 26:45.302
Look, I know that
I'm bigger than you.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.737
I know that
I'm an adult,

26:46.739 --> 26:49.707
but I... th-th-this is
my first time, okay?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.942
This is my first
time, too.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.211
I got three of you
and I'm trying.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.213
I'm sorry.
I should've been there.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.881
And I'm gonna be there, okay?

26:57.883 --> 26:59.883
Okay.

26:59.885 --> 27:00.951
Can I have a hug?

27:00.953 --> 27:03.153
Can I get a "dad, I love you"?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.810
Do you have the name
of a barber?

27:29.615 --> 27:30.848
I do.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.918
Well, I would appreciate it.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.922
Then I'll write it down.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.326
When he gets
out of the pool,

27:42.328 --> 27:43.527
you need to put
lotion on him

27:43.529 --> 27:44.762
or he gets ashy.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.863
Lotion. Okay.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.930
Thank you.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.272
Do you think that my son
could play with yours

27:55.274 --> 27:56.440
sometime after school?

27:59.779 --> 28:02.146
Yeah, yeah.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.447
I think we can do that.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.949
And does he need
sunscreen or not?

28:05.951 --> 28:07.785
He does, right?

28:11.223 --> 28:12.656
I thought he did.

28:13.659 --> 28:15.492
I knew he did!

28:15.494 --> 28:17.728
Can you tell my
husband that, please?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.396
Uh, I didn't bring
a rÃ©sumÃ©, sorry.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.065
I didn't think I'd have
a job interview.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.966
And I thought I would just
pick up an application...

28:22.968 --> 28:25.636
Oh, well, you're here
and I'm here, let's talk.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.404
* I could be your highlight,
highlight *

28:27.406 --> 28:28.972
* I could be your highlight... *

28:28.974 --> 28:30.908
you have really pretty skin.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.142
Oh, thank you.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.143
So do you.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.311
Thanks.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.879
So, Kate,

28:35.881 --> 28:38.182
do you know anything
about my store or my background?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.918
Hmm... a little.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.554
I know that you've had
this store since 2013

28:43.556 --> 28:46.190
and before that you sold
your own designs on etsy,

28:46.192 --> 28:47.257
until you partnered
with that woman

28:47.259 --> 28:49.193
that you met at uc Santa Cruz--

28:49.195 --> 28:50.994
go, banana slugs--
at her wedding

28:50.996 --> 28:52.496
in Thailand.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.597
Oh, so beautiful.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.399
Like, that is my dream trip.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.734
And then you imported
those scarves

28:56.736 --> 28:58.435
then it just, like,
took off from there.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.404
Oh, and you're divorced,
you have no kids and you look

29:00.406 --> 29:02.406
amazing in wide-brimmed hats.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.210
I assume.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.511
You just have the head for it.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.013
I don't. I look like a pacifier.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.522
I like a person who does her
research before an interview.

29:19.792 --> 29:20.791
I'm a big researcher.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.595
Hey, what's up?

29:26.232 --> 29:29.299
So, the good news is:
I got a job.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.870
Well, that means
that there's bad news.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.974
Bum-bum-bum!

29:43.315 --> 29:45.816
Adult swim.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.251
Adult swim only.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.624
You cold?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.759
* Every word I said *

29:55.761 --> 29:57.261
* when I said
that I love you... *

29:57.263 --> 29:58.262
t-shirt?

29:58.264 --> 29:59.596
I didn't bring one.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.565
* That I love you forever... *

30:01.567 --> 30:03.634
well...

30:05.137 --> 30:07.504
...i brought a t-shirt.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.072
That's the one mommy hates.

30:09.074 --> 30:10.307
Oh, mommy's just jealous.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.408
I don't think so.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.609
Well, it's true.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.011
She just pretends
like she hates it

30:14.013 --> 30:15.345
because I won't let her wear it.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.649
You know where I got this shirt?

30:18.651 --> 30:19.650
I heard mommy say

30:19.652 --> 30:20.918
it was from

30:20.920 --> 30:22.186
a drugged-out drifter.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.190
Listen, mommy doesn't know
the whole truth,

30:26.192 --> 30:27.825
so this is gonna have to stay
between us, okay?

30:27.827 --> 30:29.860
I got it...

30:30.830 --> 30:32.830
...in Florida.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.332
A magical land
called Daytona beach.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.834
Can we go there?

30:36.836 --> 30:38.335
No.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.672
No, you may never
go to Daytona beach.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.374
I want you to say it out loud:

30:44.376 --> 30:46.009
"Daddy, I will never
go to Daytona beach."

30:46.011 --> 30:48.645
Daddy, I will never
go to Daytona beach.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.780
Good girl.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.615
But I was there...

30:51.617 --> 30:56.053
And one night,
i was walking back to my hotel,

30:56.055 --> 31:00.157
and... I came across this man...

31:00.159 --> 31:01.391
A traveler.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.026
He was wearing
ragged clothes

31:03.028 --> 31:05.729
and he had a strange
way of talking.

31:05.731 --> 31:10.500
And these three young jerks
were bothering him.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.470
They were trying to take away
his bag of groceries.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.372
And so...
I chased the jerks off.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.640
By yourself?

31:16.642 --> 31:18.575
Yeah, by myself.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.878
And I had a few...

31:20.880 --> 31:24.248
Vitamin drinks and...
I chased them off.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.482
It happened.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.051
And the traveler
was so grateful,

31:28.053 --> 31:29.419
he wanted to repay me.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.321
You know,
he-he didn't have much,

31:31.323 --> 31:33.423
so he reaches
into his little satchel

31:33.425 --> 31:36.360
and he pulls out this shirt.

31:36.362 --> 31:40.364
He says to me that
it's a magic t-shirt.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.832
He said,

31:41.834 --> 31:44.368
that when you wear it,

31:44.370 --> 31:46.436
your enemies will
see you exactly as

31:46.438 --> 31:48.372
you want to be seen,

31:48.374 --> 31:50.040
and only that way.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.876
Whether it's a... a warrior,

31:52.878 --> 31:54.745
or a princess.

31:54.747 --> 31:55.746
Whatever you want.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.447
Does it work?
You tell me.

31:57.449 --> 32:01.351
I was wearing this shirt
the night I met your mom.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.421
And she thought I was the
handsomest man in the world.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.356
You?
Yeah, I know.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.692
Me.

32:08.694 --> 32:09.993
Magic.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.005
I'm gonna go with princess.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.881
I want you to know...

32:30.883 --> 32:32.883
That your daddy
already sees you that way

32:32.885 --> 32:34.952
without the shirt, okay?
You don't need it.

32:34.954 --> 32:39.189
Thanks, daddy, but
I'm gonna wear it anyway.

32:43.162 --> 32:46.964
Okay.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.298
Your highness.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.201
Need to find you a crown.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.509
Oh, my God, this
is not happening.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.912
This is-- are you-- oh.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.783
Toby.
Oh...

33:06.785 --> 33:12.189
So you're telling me
that you work for my ex-wife?

33:12.191 --> 33:13.957
I didn't mean to, okay?
It just happened.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.826
Like, i-i wanted to see her
up close.

33:15.828 --> 33:19.663
So you... just stalked her
like a serial killer.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.331
Josie and I prefer
to call it "research."

33:21.333 --> 33:22.599
"Josie and I."

33:22.601 --> 33:23.867
"Josie and i"?

33:23.869 --> 33:25.168
Wha-- how in the hell is there a

33:25.170 --> 33:27.604
Josie and I?
I don't know.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.339
I just had to know.
Know what?

33:29.341 --> 33:32.542
Toby, one of these things
is not like the other, okay?

33:32.544 --> 33:35.846
So I wondered, like was she fat
and then she got skinny?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.647
Was she a terrible person?
But no.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.483
She's actually beautiful,
and she's great,

33:39.485 --> 33:41.118
and she thinks
that I'm great,

33:41.120 --> 33:42.686
and she has amazing taste
in imported goods.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.554
Like, feel this.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.356
I don't even know what that is!

33:46.358 --> 33:47.657
It's a portfolio.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.292
Oh.
And I liked it.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.328
Is that what you want?

33:51.330 --> 33:53.063
Is that what you want?
Do you want a skinny person?

33:53.065 --> 33:56.133
No, but I would like to be
with a sane person, Kate.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.369
That is not nice.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.571
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a little
tired of being nice.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.073
Some stranger

34:03.075 --> 34:04.841
tells you that you're great
and you believe her.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.576
I tell you you're great
and you think I'm lying.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.178
Why is that?

34:08.179 --> 34:10.080
I don't... I don't know.
I have a problem.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.380
We all have problems, Kate.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.750
Toby, all of my life...

34:13.752 --> 34:15.018
You've been fat.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.753
Yeah, I get it.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.755
I empathize, clearly.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.858
I empathize,
then I say something cute,

34:21.860 --> 34:24.860
then you feel better,
rinse and repeat.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.330
She was terrible to me, Kate.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.933
Josie,

34:29.935 --> 34:33.036
this skinny, successful woman

34:33.038 --> 34:35.539
that-that you admire so much?

34:35.541 --> 34:37.607
She cheated on me,
she lied to me,

34:37.609 --> 34:40.510
and then she took
half my life savings.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.946
I gained 95 pounds

34:42.947 --> 34:46.716
in one year after she left me.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.752
At my lowest point,
i told my brother

34:48.754 --> 34:51.353
that I was committing suicide
even though that wasn't true

34:51.356 --> 34:54.891
because I wanted him to be
as scared and lonely as I was.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.594
You know what?
You know what? That's...

34:57.596 --> 35:00.030
That's a lie, I, uh...

35:02.468 --> 35:04.301
I did consider suicide.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.204
A lot.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.973
When I would get drunk.

35:09.975 --> 35:12.042
Alone.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.478
And disgust myself.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.816
So, you haven't cornered
the market on problems, Kate.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.056
God, I'm really sorry.

35:31.597 --> 35:34.131
My issues are not gonna
go away overnight, Toby.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.801
Well...

35:37.803 --> 35:39.236
Neither am I.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.705
But Jesus, Kate...

35:49.014 --> 35:50.313
Josie and I

35:50.315 --> 35:54.117
weren't good together.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.819
So we're not.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.258
It's not like I was gonna
keep the job anyway.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.993
But you know who
are good together?

36:05.664 --> 36:07.430
Matt lauer and Savannah Guthrie?

36:07.432 --> 36:09.466
Yeah, duh.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.700
I love them.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.669
And I want them to be my family.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.870
And also us.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.640
We're pretty good
together.

36:16.642 --> 36:20.510
But mostly I was talking
about Matt and Savannah.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.448
Can I keep the portfolio?

36:25.450 --> 36:27.184
Oh, my God,
you're killing me.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.319
No.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.787
Do you just want to feel it?

36:37.196 --> 36:38.495
Oh, my God.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.631
What is that?

36:41.633 --> 36:45.368
That's a baby something.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.404
<i> Leave a message for Kate.</i>

36:47.406 --> 36:49.239
Hey, hey, it's me.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.540
Um...

36:50.542 --> 36:52.342
I got the part.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.144
Yay, right?
I think.

36:54.146 --> 36:55.912
Can you call me?
Uh, it's just, you know,

36:55.914 --> 36:58.081
you're-you're usually
the one who...

36:58.083 --> 37:00.584
Who tells me how great I am,
and you're not here.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.454
So...

37:16.668 --> 37:19.669
Man, that Tess was
some snow white tonight, huh?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.772
Yeah.

37:27.279 --> 37:30.180
I've offended you somehow.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.182
No.
No, I have.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.225
You think I'm judging you.
I...

37:42.227 --> 37:45.161
Because I'm in no position
to judge you whatsoever.

37:46.632 --> 37:47.964
But you need to know,

37:47.966 --> 37:50.267
if I was in a
position to judge you,

37:50.269 --> 37:52.135
you'd be getting
a very high score.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.970
That story you told about
helping to bus little black kids

37:53.972 --> 37:55.272
in Pittsburgh.

37:55.274 --> 37:58.308
That was '86, '87?
Thereabout.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.409
So you were clean then?

37:59.411 --> 38:03.246
Just... functional?

38:03.248 --> 38:05.215
Because you know what this
little black kid was doing?

38:05.217 --> 38:06.750
I don't...
I was a little boy,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.419
living in bethel park,
Pennsylvania.

38:09.421 --> 38:12.622
Which is pretty much
the whitest place on earth.

38:12.624 --> 38:17.160
I had this little notebook...

38:17.162 --> 38:18.662
And every time I met
a new black person,

38:18.664 --> 38:23.600
I would put a mark
in this notebook.

38:23.602 --> 38:29.105
And every time I met a black
man, I wondered if, somehow,

38:29.107 --> 38:31.408
if that man
could possibly be my father.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.510
But I couldn't say that.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.845
You know, I couldn't
say it out loud

38:35.847 --> 38:39.416
because I loved my father.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.651
My white father.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.219
And my white mother.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.997
I'm a strong, successful,
black man.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.666
My wife and i
give a lot of thought

38:56.668 --> 38:58.668
to how we raise our girls,
believe that.
Yes.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.437
The fact that my daughter

39:00.439 --> 39:04.541
doesn't find anything unusual
about her playing snow white?

39:04.543 --> 39:06.676
That's the whole idea.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.011
Right?

39:10.949 --> 39:13.650
Look, i-i don't know
everything, William.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.618
I don't.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.987
But I wouldn't change a thing
about my parents,

39:17.989 --> 39:19.823
or the way that I parent,
and I will not apologize

39:19.825 --> 39:21.791
for any of it.
You shouldn't.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.259
Because I don't.
I should.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.031
Three weeks I've known you,

39:28.033 --> 39:29.799
and I still haven't
said the words.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.235
You don't have to say any...
I'm sorry.

39:34.906 --> 39:39.376
I am so deeply sorry.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.211
I did everything wrong by you.

39:41.213 --> 39:44.247
And you've done
everything right.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.916
You are doing
everything right, son.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.329
well, uh...

39:59.331 --> 40:03.533
Now, you wear whatever
you want on your walk tomorrow.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.236
Oh, I like my new flat
front khakis just fine.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.441
* I love my father,
and I love him well *

40:13.011 --> 40:14.677
Hmm.

40:14.679 --> 40:17.580
* I hope to see him
someday soon *

40:21.420 --> 40:23.586
Baby say <i> what?</i>
Uncle Kevin!

40:23.588 --> 40:25.355
Hey! How are you?
Good.
Hi!

40:25.357 --> 40:27.524
How you doing?
I'm good, how are you?

40:27.526 --> 40:28.958
Oh, you look beautiful.
Thank you.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.226
Honey, look, it's Kevin.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.628
What's up, bro?
Yo!

40:31.630 --> 40:33.630
What's going on, man?
Oh, you know.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.632
Missing my fan club,
of course, you know?

40:35.634 --> 40:38.201
And, uh, you don't mind
if I crash for a bit, right?

40:38.203 --> 40:40.703
Uh...
Uh...

40:40.705 --> 40:42.138
Absolutely.
For a time.
Yeah.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.073
Thanks.
Uncle Kevin, I was snow white!

40:44.075 --> 40:45.975
Yeah?
You should come
see the video, and

40:45.977 --> 40:48.278
we have to call Stacy klein, who
doesn't believe you're my Uncle.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.546
You're kidding me,
that's ridiculous.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.780
All right, yeah,
I'll be right there.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.415
We'll tell her what's up.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.818
She's cute.
- Yeah, she is.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.085
Hey.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.887
Hi.
Hey. Oh.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.989
Uh, Kevin, this is, uh...
Yeah?

40:59.991 --> 41:01.458
William, he's my, uh...

41:04.596 --> 41:07.497
This is my biological father.

41:07.499 --> 41:09.766
Whom I looked for,
and I found,

41:09.768 --> 41:11.468
and this is him.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.672
Uh, well, that probably

41:15.674 --> 41:16.940
is gonna be a longer
conversation,

41:16.942 --> 41:17.974
but it's good to meet you.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.509
It's a pleasure to meet you.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.344
Uncle Kevin, come on!

41:21.346 --> 41:23.646
Uh, go.
Okay. All right, yeah, no.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.081
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go. Yes, yes.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.484
All right,
where's my little Annie, huh?

41:27.486 --> 41:31.087
I miss the other
half of my fan club.

41:33.592 --> 41:34.824
Was that the man-NY?

41:34.826 --> 41:37.427
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.362
I love that show.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.464
I'm gonna go get
my autograph book.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.585

and I love him well *

42:05.290 --> 42:07.790
* I hope to see him
someday soon *

42:10.395 --> 42:12.795
* I love my father,
and I love him well *

42:12.797 --> 42:15.932
hey, is now a bad time to
mention having another kid?

42:18.069 --> 42:19.702
Are you reading?

42:19.704 --> 42:22.038
