01:46.800 --> 01:50.800
If the great Christmas icicle
continues to melt at this rate,

01:50.800 --> 01:54.300
Christmas magic
stored in the ice crystal will vanish.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.900
These days, children and their pups
just don't believe like they used to.

01:58.900 --> 02:03.200
Their focus is on themselves, instead
of on giving to others less fortunate.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.400
If they don't understand
the true meaning of Christmas,

02:06.400 --> 02:08.800
the icicle has no chance.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.500
And I'm afraid that's something
we just can't teach.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.100
Soon it will be
Puppy Paws' responsibility

02:15.100 --> 02:19.800
to show the next generation
the importance of Christmas spirit.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.400
Wa-hoo! Wa-hoo!

02:36.400 --> 02:39.600
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!
Now, Prancer and Vixen!

02:39.600 --> 02:43.300
On, Comet! On, Cupid!
On, Donner and Blitzen!

02:47.700 --> 02:50.100
That was fun. Let's do it again.

02:50.100 --> 02:54.200
I'm afraid
we're all too tired now, Puppy Paws.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
Comet, please?

02:56.400 --> 02:59.700
Look, we have a lot of work to do today.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.800
- Like what?
- Well, for one thing,

03:01.800 --> 03:03.700
we have to get ready for Christmas Eve.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.900
You know,
the most important night of the year?

03:06.900 --> 03:10.900
Fine. I'll go find some fun on my own.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.100
Oh, that pup sure has a lot to learn

03:17.100 --> 03:20.900
before he takes the reins
and is responsible for Christmas.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.000
¶ Jingle bells ring ¶

03:29.900 --> 03:32.600
¶ Jingle bells ring ¶

03:48.700 --> 03:51.100
Yippee! Yippee!

03:51.100 --> 03:52.700
¶ La, la, la, la ¶

03:52.700 --> 03:54.000
Perfect.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Three trucks done!

03:56.800 --> 03:59.400
- Here come more toys.
- I got another load.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.600
All packed and ready to go!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.800
Wagon, coming through, people!

04:03.800 --> 04:06.200
All right! This'll be good.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.600
¶ There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish ¶

04:10.600 --> 04:14.900
¶ Hurry up and fill the sleigh
With the best things on your list, hey! ¶

04:14.900 --> 04:19.000
¶ There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish ¶

04:19.000 --> 04:23.200
¶ We'll hurry up and fill the sleigh
with the best things on your list ¶

04:23.200 --> 04:27.300
¶ Santa makes it fun
He's always on the go ¶

04:27.300 --> 04:29.500
¶ You'll know it's him
When the sleigh bells ring ¶

04:29.500 --> 04:31.300
¶ And you hear "ho, ho, ho" ¶

04:31.300 --> 04:34.100
Ho!

04:34.100 --> 04:36.000
¶ Jingle bells ring ¶

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
¶ Jingle bells ring ¶

04:39.000 --> 04:41.700
¶ There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish ¶

04:41.700 --> 04:43.300
¶ Hurry up and fill the sleigh
with the best things on your list ¶

04:43.300 --> 04:45.200
Hey!

04:51.400 --> 04:54.000
- It's going fast.
- Grab those...

04:54.000 --> 04:57.400
Stop this! Stop... Ah!

04:57.400 --> 05:00.800
- Oh, no.
- What's going on? It's chaos!

05:00.800 --> 05:02.700
Come on.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.800
Yippee!

05:04.800 --> 05:09.000
- Grab that...
- Uh-oh. This is getting out of control.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.700
Oh!

05:13.800 --> 05:17.200
Watch out!

05:17.900 --> 05:20.800
- I checked it a couple minutes ago.
- What do you mean?

05:22.100 --> 05:23.700
Puppy Paws!

05:28.400 --> 05:31.200
Son, I am very disappointed in you.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.100
You disrupted the workshop
and wasted a whole day of work.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.300
The elves are very upset.
They're now another day behind schedule.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.000
You know how hard they work
getting ready.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
I didn't realize
it would cause such havoc.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.600
I just wanted to have some fun.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.900
Maybe you should be thinking
about how important Christmas is

05:49.900 --> 05:52.700
to children and puppies
all around the world.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.900
It's our responsibility
to deliver good puppies the gift

05:55.900 --> 05:58.200
they've wished for the entire year.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.500
You mean it's your responsibility.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.800
I just want to be an ordinary puppy.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.100
You're grounded until further notice.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.800
That means no playing fetch
with the elves

06:07.800 --> 06:09.700
and no flying with the reindeer.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.000
I wish Christmas would just go away.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.400
Puppy Paws!
What a horrible thing to say!

06:20.200 --> 06:22.200
Do you think I was too strict with him?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.300
Maybe just a smidgen, but...

06:25.300 --> 06:26.800
...I'm sure he'll get over it.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.200
Puppy Paws has to understand,

06:29.200 --> 06:31.400
he's the future of Christmas.

06:31.400 --> 06:36.200
¶ Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree ¶

06:36.200 --> 06:39.600
¶ How steadfast are your branches ¶

06:39.600 --> 06:44.000
¶ Your boughs are green in summertime ¶

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
¶ And through the snows of wintertime ¶

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
¶ Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree... ¶

06:51.000 --> 06:53.100
You pups want to sing along?

06:53.100 --> 06:55.100
Yo, I don't sing. I rap.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.900
Why do we even have to come here?

06:56.900 --> 06:59.300
It's a Christmas tradition.

06:59.300 --> 07:03.300
I've been watching the lighting of the
tree since I was a pup like you Buddies.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.800
You're quiet this evening, Budderball.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.500
I hadn't even
heard your stomach grumble.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.300
Anything the matter?

07:11.300 --> 07:14.600
I'm still in the doghouse
for eating the Thanksgiving turkey.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.700
Are you worried you might be
on Santa Paws' naughty list?

07:17.700 --> 07:22.500
Pshaw! Santa Paws is just Dad
dressed up in a red and white suit.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.200
That's all, dawg.
They just use it so we behave all year.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.800
Is that right, B-Dawg?

07:27.800 --> 07:30.200
Let's look at the evidence,
Deputy Sniffer.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.300
If the jolly dude came down the chimney,
wouldn't there be a lot of soot?

07:34.300 --> 07:37.700
I'm not really buying the whole
"Santa Paws" thing, either,

07:37.700 --> 07:40.000
but I sure do love all the presents.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.900
Your material desires
are those of the wanting mind.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.600
Enough is never enough.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.000
Buddha's right, Buddies.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.300
Getting material things
isn't what Christmas is all about.

07:49.300 --> 07:54.500
Christmas spirit is about the unselfish
spreading of love and kindness.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.300
There are plenty of lonely puppies

07:56.300 --> 07:59.400
without families
or children to love them.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.900
¶ Your boughs can teach a lesson ¶

08:02.900 --> 08:08.000
Hello, everybody.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.800
Thank you for coming down
to the annual lighting

08:10.800 --> 08:13.500
of the Fernfield Christmas tree.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.100
Not quite the turnout we expected.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.400
Three...

08:22.400 --> 08:25.300
...two... one!

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Buddies, it's Mr. Cruge,
the dog catcher.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.400
Oh, jiminy Christmas!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.500
It's probably just a faulty bulb.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.600
Oh...

09:14.600 --> 09:16.400
Phew!

09:18.600 --> 09:21.000
Oh, my!

09:21.000 --> 09:24.400
Thank you, Lord,
for this blessing. Amen.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.500
Thought you could
run wild in the streets?

09:53.500 --> 09:56.000
Not on my watch you don't.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.900
I don't wanna be
responsible for Christmas.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.200
I just wanna be an ordinary puppy.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.100
I wish Christmas would just disappear.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.100
The naughty book
gets thicker every year.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.600
We're just on the pups.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.400
If Puppy Paws doesn't understand
the true meaning of Christmas,

10:54.400 --> 10:57.700
- how could we expect other puppies to?
- Mm-hm.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.100
"Bubba.
Offense: destruction of property.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.600
Chewing shoes, 17 cases".

11:04.600 --> 11:07.700
Oh, my. That is naughty, all right.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.500
"Budderball. Offense: gluttony.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.600
Eating the Thanksgiving turkey".

11:28.300 --> 11:30.700
Whoa!

11:30.700 --> 11:32.300
Budderball!

11:33.000 --> 11:34.900
Big appetite for a pup.

11:34.900 --> 11:39.000
I have the feeling little Budderball's
tummy always leads to naughtiness.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.300
Santa Paws, Claus, we got the mail truck
ready for a systems check.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.500
Great, Eli.
We could use a break from this.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.100
Haven't even checked the list twice
and we're already tired.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.200
Hm.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.000
Budderball. One of the five Air Buddies.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.700
He has three brothers,

12:01.700 --> 12:05.800
Mudbud, B-Dawg, Buddha,
and a little sis, Rosebud.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.600
They live in Fernfield, Washington,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.200
each with their own families.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.800
Regular, ordinary, fun-loving pups.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.400
They sound perfect!

12:16.100 --> 12:18.300
Hey, Eugene!

12:23.100 --> 12:25.700
OK. The sooner you get going,
the better.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.400
We've got
a lot of pickups scheduled.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.500
Over 1,000 cities and towns.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.600
Eli, sir, she's all yours.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.900
Confirming. The route is programmed.

12:34.900 --> 12:39.100
OK, let's run
the diagnostic tests. New Delhi.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.300
Oh, I am liking this very, very much.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.800
Florence.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.900
All seems in the working order,
Santy Claus.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.100
You give me the clearance,
I'm ready to roll.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.600
That's an all-clear from the North Pole.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.100
Well, here I go.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.900
Time to hitch a ride to Fernfield.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.600
Good work, team.
We're right on schedule.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.900
Jingle all the way, Eli.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
Bye!

13:23.500 --> 13:25.400
Have a safe trip.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.200
Holding up all right?
Good, good...

13:33.900 --> 13:35.600
Ah, good work.

13:48.200 --> 13:52.000
Oh, no!

13:57.600 --> 13:59.700
I don't like the look of this one bit.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.100
It's happening fast.

14:02.100 --> 14:06.500
The magic of Christmas
is fading away, right before our eyes.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.000
"Fernfield:
Where everything is possible".

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
My kind of place.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.900
Holy Christmas spirit.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.700
We're almost out of power.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.900
Oh!

16:06.800 --> 16:10.700
It looks to me like we've tapped
into all the additional power we've got.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.500
Oh, my. Another leak.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.300
I hate to even say it, but I think
the North Pole is starting to melt.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.400
Any thoughts, Eddy?

16:21.400 --> 16:25.800
Well, sir, spirit is down, but there
seems to be something else going on.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.900
The icicle is melting faster
than we ever thought possible.

16:28.900 --> 16:32.600
Has anyone seen Puppy Paws?
He seems to be missing.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.300
My guess would be the stables.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.700
You know how he loves to play tricks
on Donner and Blitzen.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
Come on then, you're next.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.800
Ho-ho-ho.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.400
What do you want?

16:56.400 --> 17:00.500
I was hoping you could deliver this note
to the real Santa for me?

17:00.500 --> 17:03.000
- The real Santa?
- I know that the real Santa

17:03.000 --> 17:06.700
is busy at the North Pole making gifts
and you're just one of his helpers.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.000
If you could deliver this note to him,
I would really appreciate it.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.800
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.800
OK. Time's up.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.800
There's other boys and girls
that need to see Hank.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.200
- I mean, Santa.
- Merry Christmas, sir.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.000
- Thank you. And God bless.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Ho-ho-ho. What do you want?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.900
They couldn't have found me already.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.400
Ah! Ah!

18:08.400 --> 18:12.100
I did it! Holy... Oh!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.300
Say "cheese," pipsqueak.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.100
Man, this is itchy.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.000
Ew! An imposter.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.000
All right!

18:31.200 --> 18:32.700
Whoa!

18:32.700 --> 18:34.600
What are you doing?!

18:36.400 --> 18:37.900
Oh!

18:37.900 --> 18:39.300
What'll it be?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.100
- Yes!
- Hey! What in the heck are you doing?

18:43.100 --> 18:45.700
That dog. I'm trying to catch that dog!

19:03.700 --> 19:05.300
Comet, what's wrong?

19:05.300 --> 19:09.400
Santa Claus, Santa Paws,
I wouldn't come in here if I were you.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.200
All of us reindeer, we've been
hit with some sort of flu bug.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.500
Could be contagious.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.300
Are you gonna be OK?

19:17.300 --> 19:19.700
I don't know, Santa.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.300
Cupid isn't feeling the love
and Dancer isn't doing much dancing.

19:23.300 --> 19:28.500
- We all feel really weak.
- It's a lack of energy from the icicle.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.300
It's affecting us all.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.100
Is there anything we can help with?

19:32.100 --> 19:33.900
We're looking for Puppy Paws.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.800
- Have you seen him?
- Come to think of it, no.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.200
He hasn't been
asking us for rides...

19:40.200 --> 19:42.000
Everything OK?

19:46.200 --> 19:50.000
People sure aren't
very jolly in Fernfield.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.300
I think it's time to call it a night.

19:52.300 --> 19:55.300
- Thanks again, Mrs. Davis.
- Take care.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.400
I guess I'll have to find Budderball
in the morning.

20:05.500 --> 20:10.100
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

20:15.200 --> 20:19.900
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

20:44.400 --> 20:47.000
Hey, look, everybody, Eli's back.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.900
Hey, what happened? You're back early.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.200
For a minute there
I thought I might have to push.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.200
- What's wrong with the truck?
- Almost ran out of power.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.400
Where's all the mail, sir?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.300
That's all there was.

21:19.300 --> 21:23.100
Oh! Sweet mama! Gingerbread cookies!

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Budderball? Is it really you?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.700
I've been looking for you all over town.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.600
Wow! That polar bear cub
sure looks realistic.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.900
His mouth even moves.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.400
Come on, big fella!

21:37.400 --> 21:39.900
Budderball! Wait!

21:40.200 --> 21:41.800
Good boy.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.900
Oh, my!

21:53.600 --> 21:57.600
All right. I've just got... Hm.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.200
OK... Just a little knot here.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.600
What in tarnation? Huh?

22:16.100 --> 22:19.100
Excuse me?

22:19.100 --> 22:22.500
- Excuse me!
- Huh? Oh...

22:23.100 --> 22:26.100
Oh, hello there, young'un.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.200
Deputy Sniffer at your service.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.900
I'm looking for a pup I just saw.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.500
But then he disappeared.
His name is Budderball.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.000
Oh, I've known that pup his whole life.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.600
So you know where he lives?

22:36.600 --> 22:39.100
Budderball lives at Livingston Manor.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.500
Now to get there
you want to go left down Main Street,

22:42.500 --> 22:46.100
then take a right
at the candy store and keep going.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.900
It's on the outskirts of town.
You can't miss it.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.400
Thanks, Deputy.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.000
OK, heads up, I'm sending it down.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Thanks, Budderball.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.200
Got it.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.300
This must be it.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.900
I think I got some in the van.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.700
Yeah, there's a box right there.
I'll grab 'em.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.800
Here you go!

23:31.300 --> 23:33.300
I'll send them up.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.300
- A bit heavy.
- OK, I got it.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.300
OK. You sure?

23:46.100 --> 23:49.900
Well, I think we

23:49.900 --> 23:52.500
are just about done.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.000
I think we should lower
the candy canes a little.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.800
They're kinda hard to... see.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.100
Oh, that's heavy.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.900
Off we go.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.200
Come on, Budderball.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.100
Whoa!

24:18.400 --> 24:20.700
Oh, sweet mama.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.200
I'm not sure how Dad does this,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.500
but here goes nothing.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.000
Aah!

24:43.100 --> 24:45.200
- Oh!
- Oh!

24:47.300 --> 24:50.600
Hey! Do you mind getting off me?

24:50.600 --> 24:52.900
It's you, right? Budderball?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.800
I finally found you!

24:56.800 --> 25:00.700
Who do you think you are, rolling out of
my chimney and busting my candy cane?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.000
I'm Puppy Paws. Pleased to meet you.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.400
- Where do you come from?
- The North Pole.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.500
Oh, yeah.
I bet you belong to Santa Claus.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.200
Well, technically, yes.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.500
But Santa Paws is my pa.

25:12.500 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, right. You expect me to believe
that your dad is Santa Paws?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
- Why wouldn't you?
- Who put you up to this?

25:20.000 --> 25:23.800
No one. I was checking the naughty list
and you looked like fun.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.000
What'd you say?
I'm on the naughty list?!

25:26.000 --> 25:28.100
It was just a little turkey!

25:28.100 --> 25:31.300
Don't worry, you can get off
the naughty list and onto the nice list

25:31.300 --> 25:33.100
by doing good deeds for others.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.900
- Like?
- Well, um...

25:35.900 --> 25:38.800
Like teaching me
how to be an ordinary pup.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.100
OK, well,
I'll show you what I like to do.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.200
This is
the most magical room in the house.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.900
What kind of toys do you make here?

25:52.900 --> 25:55.200
They don't make toys, they make food.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.200
The most delicious food around.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.200
Like roast beef sandwiches,
chicken wings, chili dogs...

26:00.200 --> 26:01.600
Is he one of your elves?

26:01.600 --> 26:04.800
You're a real joker, aren't you?
That's the chef.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.000
- What's he doing?
- Making cookies.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.800
But we can't eat them,
they're for Christmas.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.700
Huh?

26:17.700 --> 26:19.900
Hey, how'd you get up there?

26:22.100 --> 26:24.700
Uh-oh!

26:24.700 --> 26:26.700
Bad idea.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.200
- Wow!
- What?

26:35.200 --> 26:39.000
Those cookies.
They just changed. How did you do that?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.200
It's no biggie.
Christmas magic is stored in here.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.100
So I can do stuff like my dad.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.300
But I can't quite control it.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.300
Hey, you want a cookie?

26:48.300 --> 26:51.600
Don't you remember?
I'm trying to get back on the nice list.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.300
Well, suit yourself.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.900
Om... Om... Om...

27:02.900 --> 27:05.900
Be good, Budderball, be good.
Don't eat the cookies!

27:09.000 --> 27:13.500
- Oh, no!
- My compliments to the chef.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.500
I believe it's time for lunch, Budder...

27:20.200 --> 27:23.500
ball.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.800
Oh, yeah, laugh it up.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.700
Now I'm going to be late
meeting my brothers and sis in the park!

27:38.700 --> 27:41.200
Hey. How about you introduce me to them?

27:41.200 --> 27:44.800
Once I get done with my timeout,
I'd be happy to get you out of my fur!

27:44.800 --> 27:47.200
Thanks! You're the best!

27:48.500 --> 27:51.000
Is Budderball fashionably late again?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.800
I hope the dude's not in trouble.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.800
I'll meditate
and send him some positive energy.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.100
Om...

27:58.100 --> 28:00.800
Om...

28:00.800 --> 28:03.700
Who's the white,
fluffy dude Budderball's with?

28:06.700 --> 28:08.700
Puppy Paws, these are the Buddies.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.200
The mucky pup is Mudbud.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.800
The blinged-out one is B-Dawg.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.200
- Buddha looks like he's sleeping...
- Om...

28:14.200 --> 28:16.200
...but he calls it meditation.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.400
Oh. And Rosebud is our little sis.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.300
But don't let the pink bow fool you.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.100
She's feistier than she looks.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.400
And this is Puppy Paws.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.300
He claims to be Santa Paws' son
from the North Pole.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.100
Yo, you straight up trippin'?

28:29.100 --> 28:31.400
We ain't fallin' for that, dawg.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.100
I'm sorry about my brother.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.000
We've just grown
a little skeptical about Christmas.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.900
You're not alone. No one believes
in Christmas spirit anymore.

28:39.900 --> 28:43.200
That's why I'm here.
To learn how to be an ordinary pup.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.900
Well, you found
the right dog to school you.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.000
Come on, I'll show you my crib.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.200
All right, dawg, I'm gonna
show you how to kick it like me.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.000
- I like kickin' it.
- Yeah, you know, bust some moves.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.800
Uh... Yeah, bust some moves.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.000
Watch and learn, cuz.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.400
I call this the four paw pop,

29:21.400 --> 29:23.500
into the boogaloo jaw drop,

29:23.500 --> 29:27.900
to the tail rotation
for the B-Dawg Nation.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.200
Yeah. Way to break those moves.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.200
Yeah, I know. I'm the best.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.100
Let's see you give it a shot, playa.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.200
OK, I'll give it a whirl, playa.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.100
I call this the Prancer hop 'n bop...

29:45.100 --> 29:48.100
- Huh?
- to the spinning toy top,

29:48.800 --> 29:51.800
to the elf hustle 'n bustle,

29:51.800 --> 29:54.300
to the shiny toy train.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.200
Oh!

29:57.200 --> 29:59.000
Whoa!

29:59.000 --> 30:00.800
Did I bust some moves?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.300
You busted something, all right.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.100
- Hey, dudes.
- Yo, dawg,

30:12.100 --> 30:15.000
it is your turn
to hang with Santa Junior.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.400
- No problemo, dude.
- We'll see about that, dawg.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.600
Why is he in such a huff?

30:23.600 --> 30:26.500
I don't know, dawg.
He be trippin', for shizzle.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.200
Wowzers, dude.
You don't have to talk like B-Dawg.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.600
Isn't that how ordinary puppies talk?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.100
Dude, only B-Dawg talks like that.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.200
Oh. So, what are you doing... dude?

30:38.200 --> 30:41.300
Just chillaxing with a mud bath, dude.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.900
Dude, can I give it a roll?

30:51.300 --> 30:52.900
Now what are we gonna do, dude?

30:52.900 --> 30:56.100
Let me show you my sweet pad, dude.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.000
This is the cleanest room in the house.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.900
Strictly off limits.

31:15.300 --> 31:19.900
Dude!
Is it normal for mud to feel itchy?

31:19.900 --> 31:21.700
No, dude! Don't do it!

31:34.900 --> 31:37.600
Whoa! How'd you do that, dude?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.300
I don't know. It just happens, dude.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.800
Dude...

31:58.400 --> 32:00.600
Dudette, where are you?

32:02.200 --> 32:05.900
What's up? Alice is about
to give me a new Christmas outfit.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.300
Oh, no. What happened to you?

32:08.300 --> 32:11.300
Someone played a dirty trick on me.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.200
You've gotta hang with Puppy Paws now.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.300
I have to wear this clean coat
as punishment.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.900
Later, dudenator.

32:22.900 --> 32:26.500
So, what sweet stuff
are we going to do, dudette?

32:26.500 --> 32:28.100
Oh, brother.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.800
Awesome, and I'll call you "sis".

32:30.800 --> 32:32.500
I've never had a sis before.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.300
Or a brother. This is gonna be epic!

32:35.300 --> 32:37.200
Rosebud! Where are you?

32:37.200 --> 32:40.600
Like, wait here. I'll be back
with a whole new Christmas look.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.700
Wow! Like, that should be fun.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.900
Hey, Rosebud.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.600
You're gonna love this, Rosebud.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.500
So, what do you think?

32:57.500 --> 32:59.600
You're right. What was I thinking?

32:59.600 --> 33:03.000
Accessories!
Hang on. I'll be right back.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.700
What's taking so long?

33:13.800 --> 33:16.000
You startled me.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.600
- That's your new Christmas look?
- You don't like it?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.200
I think it's totally fetch.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.000
I like it,
but it's not very Christmassy.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.500
What could be
more Christmassy than this?

33:33.700 --> 33:38.400
Om... Om...

33:38.400 --> 33:41.500
- Om...
- Excuse me!

33:41.500 --> 33:43.100
Rosebud sent me.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.400
She was, like, totally freaking out
about her Christmas makeover.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.800
Well, it's time for meditation.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.600
This Buddha statue
came from the Ming Dynasty,

33:52.600 --> 33:56.000
over 600 years old. Very sacred.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.900
So, like, how do we do
this "meditate" stuff?

33:58.900 --> 34:00.600
We simply sit and breathe.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.700
A clear mind is developed
through meditation.

34:03.700 --> 34:07.500
- Om...
- Om...

34:07.500 --> 34:10.600
Om...

34:17.400 --> 34:18.699
My Buddha statue!

34:18.699 --> 34:22.199
It's a snowman,
very Zen in the North Pole.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.400
Hello?

34:53.400 --> 34:55.699
Anyone here?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.700
Yes?

35:03.700 --> 35:05.900
Hi. Um...

35:05.900 --> 35:08.200
My son would like a puppy for Christmas.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.900
Ha!

35:10.500 --> 35:13.500
Well, then,
you've come to the right place.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.200
Quiet!

35:24.100 --> 35:26.700
- Where are the puppies?
- They're hiding.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.800
They'll come out
if they know what's good for 'em.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.200
This is the one.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.500
She's perfect. I'll take her.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.200
That's $300.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.800
I thought the puppies were free for
adoption. We'll give her a loving home.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.400
- Take good care of her.
- You're wasting your breath.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.800
That doesn't matter to me.
I just want the $300.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.800
It's for my son for Christmas.
He's sick.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.000
A puppy might be just
what he needs to brighten his spirits.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.500
I have $50.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.800
No money, no mutt.

36:06.300 --> 36:09.000
If you can find it in your heart...

36:20.900 --> 36:22.300
Ha!

36:23.600 --> 36:27.200
- Dudes, where's Buddha?
- Buddha's always on time,

36:27.200 --> 36:29.600
whereas I'm only on time at dinnertime.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.700
I sent Puppy Paws over to Buddha's.

36:31.700 --> 36:34.700
I thought he might be the only one
with the patience to handle him.

36:34.700 --> 36:38.200
That "being one
with the universe" stuff...

36:38.200 --> 36:40.000
So powerful.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
And being present,
not just giving presents, is so Zen.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.800
- So, how'd it go?
- I lost it.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.500
What's the "it," Zen Master?

36:47.500 --> 36:50.400
My temper! That's the "it" I lost, OK?

36:50.400 --> 36:53.700
Hey, I know something
that ordinary puppies always do.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.200
- Play Hide-and-Go-Seek.
- Hide-and-Go-Seek? What's that?

36:57.200 --> 37:00.300
You close your eyes
and count down from 12 while we hide.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.900
When you finish counting,
you yell really loud,

37:02.900 --> 37:04.800
"Ready or not, here I come!"

37:04.800 --> 37:06.900
And you start looking for us, got it?

37:06.900 --> 37:09.300
Yo, BFFing dudes,

37:09.300 --> 37:13.500
that sounds like mad,
gnarly fun for shizzle! Namaste.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.700
Oh, brother.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.200
Twelve drummers drumming,
eleven pipers piping...

37:19.200 --> 37:23.500
Everyone go in a separate direction
and meet behind the stump.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.800
Eight maids a-milking,
seven swans a-swimming.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.900
Six geese a-laying, five golden rings.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.700
Two turtle doves,

37:37.700 --> 37:40.100
and a partridge in a pear tree.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.700
That's twelve!

37:42.400 --> 37:44.200
Here I come!

37:44.200 --> 37:47.100
I called you to this stump meeting
to discuss Puppy Paws

37:47.100 --> 37:49.300
and what we are going to do with him.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.700
This game isn't so hard.

37:59.100 --> 38:03.600
Puppy Paws actually thinks
that I'm buying that his pop is Santa.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.100
I'm not even shopping, yo.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.300
That dude got me
in some serious doo-doo.

38:09.300 --> 38:13.400
I had the humiliation of wearing
a clean coat for the entire day.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.800
If he's Santa Paws' son,
why'd he get me in more trouble,

38:16.800 --> 38:19.300
rather than helping me
get off the naughty list?

38:19.300 --> 38:23.300
And you should have seen what he did
to me. It was a fashion disaster.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.800
But I was just trying to be like them.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.700
Wait a second, Buddies.
We all have our own karma.

38:34.700 --> 38:38.100
Puppy Paws is not responsible
for me losing my center.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.700
To find faults in him,

38:39.700 --> 38:42.200
we're really just
finding faults in ourselves.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.800
The Zen dude is correctamundo.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.000
He was only trying to fit in.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.600
Oh!

38:59.900 --> 39:02.700
I was only jealous

39:02.700 --> 39:05.500
'cause the dawg schooled me
in the hip-hop battle.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.900
I guess I ate myself
onto the naughty list.

39:07.900 --> 39:11.800
It's my responsibility
to get myself off, not Puppy Paws'.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.600
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.000
Poor Puppy Paws
doesn't have any brothers or sisters.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.500
I couldn't imagine not having you guys.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.500
Let's embrace Puppy Paws
with compassion.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.100
Where did the dude go?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.900
The Christmas icicle is almost gone.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.000
I wouldn't believe it
if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.500
When Puppy Paws left,
the icicle started melting even faster.

40:11.500 --> 40:16.800
If we don't find Puppy Paws, Christmas
as we know it will be lost forever.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.900
All right. Come on. Come on.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.100
Sniff, sniff. All right, let's go.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.800
All right now.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.700
Ah, come on.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.300
Quiet!

40:42.000 --> 40:43.600
Come on, come on.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.200
All right.

40:49.500 --> 40:54.900
Yeah, you won't be needing
this anymore.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.100
In you go.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.900
"Property of the North Pole?"

41:15.100 --> 41:17.700
Very, very funny.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.000
What is this place?

41:41.600 --> 41:46.000
The pound is where they put
us dogs that no one cares about.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.000
No one cares about you?

41:48.700 --> 41:51.400
- What's your name?
- They call me Tiny,

41:51.400 --> 41:54.400
because I'm the smallest
of all the puppies.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.200
I'm Puppy Paws. What's with that guy?

41:57.200 --> 41:59.800
Did he get
coal in his stocking or something?

41:59.800 --> 42:02.000
He lost his Christmas spirit.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.400
No one cares about Christmas anymore.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
We do.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.700
The hope for a Christmas miracle
is all we have.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.100
¶ Every night I look up

42:17.100 --> 42:20.700
¶ And pray that someone sees

42:20.700 --> 42:24.200
¶ The sadness in these lonely eyes

42:24.200 --> 42:27.500
¶ And shares his love with me

42:27.500 --> 42:30.700
¶ As the night grows colder

42:30.700 --> 42:33.900
¶ We really need to find

42:33.900 --> 42:37.600
¶ A way to heal the hope we've lost

42:37.600 --> 42:41.600
¶ We really need a sign

42:41.600 --> 42:44.100
¶ We need to know

42:45.500 --> 42:51.200
¶ That there are Christmas miracles

42:51.200 --> 42:54.600
¶ This year

43:06.000 --> 43:09.800
Good job.
Now make a wish and we'll turn it on.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.900
I wish that Santa
would get my letter.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.800
Here we go.

43:17.800 --> 43:21.400
¶ We need to know ¶

43:21.400 --> 43:25.600
¶ That there are Christmas miracles ¶

43:25.600 --> 43:28.500
¶ Somewhere in our hearts ¶

43:28.500 --> 43:34.000
¶ Somewhere in our souls
We need to feel ¶

43:34.000 --> 43:37.900
¶ The love, the hope and the cheer ¶

43:37.900 --> 43:43.600
¶ The magic in this time of year ¶

43:43.600 --> 43:47.300
¶ We need a Christmas miracle ¶

43:47.300 --> 43:52.400
¶ A Christmas miracle ¶

43:52.400 --> 43:55.300
¶ This year ¶

43:57.400 --> 43:59.300
I had no idea.

43:59.300 --> 44:02.700
Thank you, Tiny. Thank you.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.100
- Magicometer.
- Magicometer.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.700
Well, did you find any way
of boosting the power?

44:32.500 --> 44:35.700
The boys have modified the E.L.F.
compressor with the magicometers

44:35.700 --> 44:38.300
and gotten a little more power
with the spiriters.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.100
We have great news!

44:46.100 --> 44:48.800
I think we know where Puppy Paws is.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.500
Fernfield, Washington.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.300
In search of a pup
named Budderball.

44:52.300 --> 44:55.300
You know how he was saying
he just wanted to be an ordinary pup?

44:56.500 --> 44:59.700
Santa Claus? Santa Paws? You OK?

44:59.700 --> 45:03.600
Please, bring back Puppy Paws
as fast as you can.

45:03.600 --> 45:08.100
Without him, I'm afraid Christmas
may be gone forever.

45:09.700 --> 45:13.700
Yes, sir! We'll be back quicker
than you can say "Candy Cane Lane".

45:33.900 --> 45:37.900
Well, at least we made it. I have
no idea how we're gonna get back.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.700
The tank
is completely out of magic.

45:43.900 --> 45:46.500
All right. I'll try and find Puppy Paws.

45:46.500 --> 45:49.700
And I'll see what I can do
about the truck so we can get home.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.900
- Where's Budderball?
- That dawg ain't ever on time.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.100
Being fashionably late is one thing,
but this is way out of style.

46:02.900 --> 46:07.400
Dude, am I hallucinating
or is Budderball running with an elf?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.700
It's an elf, all right.

46:08.700 --> 46:12.200
Where does he find these dawgs?
The looney bin?

46:15.300 --> 46:17.600
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.100
I had another surprise visitor
from way up north.

46:20.100 --> 46:23.400
This is Eddy.
He claims to be Santa Paws' head elf.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.500
We need your help.
Christmas is in great danger.

46:26.500 --> 46:29.300
And we need to get Puppy Paws
back to the North Pole.

46:29.300 --> 46:34.100
Well, I for one totally love your shoes,
and will do anything to help.

46:34.100 --> 46:37.800
Your presence indicates that
our disbelief may have been unfounded.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.600
But, regardless, there is one obstacle.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.300
Puppy Paws has disappeared.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.800
Quick, hide! It's Cruge!

46:49.300 --> 46:51.400
Come on, let's go!

46:52.800 --> 46:55.800
- Coming through!
- Hurry up.

47:00.500 --> 47:04.000
Oh, no! Do you think Puppy Paws
might be in the pound?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.300
This way, dawgs!

47:11.000 --> 47:14.200
All right...

47:17.700 --> 47:20.700
No magic in the tank,
no way to get home.

47:21.500 --> 47:24.200
It's officially the end
of Christmas spirit.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.800
- Next.
- Have a nice day.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.600
- Hello.
- That's great.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.300
Hm...

47:46.000 --> 47:48.700
There it is. There you go.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.600
- Look at that. Keep it moving.
- Thank you.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.200
If I had enough magic,
even just a little...

47:53.200 --> 47:54.800
Hey!

47:54.800 --> 47:58.000
Bub, look, I'm all for slacking off,

47:58.000 --> 48:01.600
but I've been busting my hump over here
and you've been standing over here...

48:01.600 --> 48:04.200
- hiding out, so...
- Oh, I'm not hiding out.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.300
I'm trying to see
if I can make this sleigh fly

48:06.300 --> 48:09.500
so that we can get Puppy Paws back
to the North Pole and save Christmas.

48:09.500 --> 48:13.000
Puppy Paws! Of course! Yes!

48:13.000 --> 48:15.100
Ooh! I have an idea!

48:15.100 --> 48:17.600
Let's sprinkle a little fairy dust
all over the reindeer

48:17.600 --> 48:21.000
to come alive and then
they can fly you back to Santy Claus.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.500
Do you have some?

48:23.700 --> 48:26.700
No. No...
If you don't get back to work right now,

48:26.700 --> 48:28.500
I'm gonna tell the big boss, OK?

48:28.500 --> 48:30.400
This is killing me.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.700
- You want your uniform revoked?
- Oh, of course not.

48:33.700 --> 48:35.700
All right, follow me.

48:40.400 --> 48:44.000
Uh... I don't think anyone's home.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Maybe we should come back
another time, dawgs?

48:47.000 --> 48:50.500
Dudes, look! There's a hole in the back!

48:52.200 --> 48:54.100
Yo, dawgs, hold up!

49:04.400 --> 49:08.100
OK, you know the plan.
Budderball, you're on lookout.

49:08.100 --> 49:10.400
Bark twice if Mr. Cruge returns.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.700
Mudbud and B-Dawg,
you find the key.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.300
Buddha, Eddy and I will find Puppy Paws.

49:15.300 --> 49:18.200
- Got it?
- Go! Quickly!

49:18.200 --> 49:21.200
- Come on, let's go!
- Hurry.

49:26.400 --> 49:29.100
Puppy Paws!

49:29.100 --> 49:32.800
Eddy! Is that you?
Over here, last cage.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.900
Eddy, I'm so happy to see you.

49:34.900 --> 49:37.300
I'm so sorry I messed everything up.

49:37.300 --> 49:40.600
From now on,
I promise to be good for goodness sake.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.100
We're gonna need you
to be great for greatness sake.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.400
The Christmas icicle
has all but melted now.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.600
Santa Claus and Santa Paws
need you back.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.700
Your dad has grown very weak.

49:49.700 --> 49:52.300
Your dad is Santa Paws?

49:52.900 --> 49:55.300
There isn't going to be a Christmas?

49:55.300 --> 49:57.200
I won't let that happen, Tiny.

49:57.200 --> 50:00.200
You pups taught me
the true meaning of Christmas spirit.

50:00.200 --> 50:04.800
It's not just about presents.
In fact, it's not about presents at all.

50:04.800 --> 50:08.500
It's about things you can't
wrap in a box or tie with a bow.

50:09.100 --> 50:11.900
First, find my collar
so we can get out of here.

50:11.900 --> 50:13.400
I'll retrieve it.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.300
- The key is not in here.
- It's not over here, dawg.

50:19.300 --> 50:21.600
We've gotta find Puppy Paws' collar.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.500
There's too many, dawg. Which one is it?

50:31.500 --> 50:34.200
I remember! It looks like a candy cane.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.400
There it is!

50:57.800 --> 51:00.900
It's about time. Hurry!

51:06.700 --> 51:09.100
Wow! I can't thank you guys enough.

51:09.100 --> 51:12.200
That's what friends do,
help each other out of a jam.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.900
Budderball, if you're here,
then who's on the lookout?

51:28.900 --> 51:30.400
Uh...

51:30.900 --> 51:32.600
Huh?

51:33.900 --> 51:35.900
Ha! They're coming to me now!

51:35.900 --> 51:38.000
You guys go. I'll take care of him.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.400
And we will help.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.900
You would be willing to do that
for Christmas?

51:41.900 --> 51:44.100
It's us or saving Christmas, right?

51:44.100 --> 51:49.600
This job just gets easier and easier.

51:50.300 --> 51:51.900
Get back in your cage.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.300
Get out of here, go! Quickly!

51:53.300 --> 51:55.200
Eli's waiting for you
in front of town hall.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.100
You guys can do it. I know you can.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.200
You're our Christmas miracle.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.400
We won't let you down, Tiny.

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
Come on, let's go!

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
Follow me.

52:11.700 --> 52:13.700
Watch out! Coming through!

52:13.700 --> 52:15.300
Move over, guys!

52:15.300 --> 52:18.400
Hey, hey! No, no, no!

52:18.400 --> 52:20.000
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

52:20.000 --> 52:21.700
Go away! Go away!

52:21.700 --> 52:23.300
Oh!

52:25.500 --> 52:27.700
Oh...

52:27.700 --> 52:30.400
Go away. Go away!

52:30.400 --> 52:32.900
I'm ticklish!

52:34.800 --> 52:36.500
I'm ticklish!

52:42.400 --> 52:45.200
I'm ticklish!

52:53.800 --> 52:57.200
Eli, wake up!

52:57.200 --> 52:58.300
Puppy Paws!

52:58.300 --> 53:01.200
We've got to
get back to the North Pole right away!

53:01.200 --> 53:03.700
- How'd you get here?
- The mail truck.

53:03.700 --> 53:05.900
But it doesn't have enough power
to get us back.

53:05.900 --> 53:08.900
I've been trying to figure out
how to get this sleigh to work...

53:10.700 --> 53:13.000
Puppy Paws, your collar!

53:13.200 --> 53:16.100
It might have enough magic
to make this thing fly.

53:16.100 --> 53:18.500
It's lighter than the truck
and it needs a lot less power.

53:18.500 --> 53:22.000
- But we still need reindeer.
- There are no reindeer in Fernfield

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
other than
those plastic ones right there.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.600
Wait a sec!
We know how to pull a sleigh.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.300
Let me get this straight, Elf Dude.

53:28.300 --> 53:30.300
All we have to do is pull the sleigh

53:30.300 --> 53:33.300
and Puppy Paws' magic collar
will make it fly?

53:33.300 --> 53:36.500
- That is correct.
- Will you guys do it?

53:36.500 --> 53:39.500
B~Dawg is all about the heroics.

53:39.500 --> 53:42.600
Yo, P-Squared,
you need help saving Christmas,

53:42.600 --> 53:45.200
- we're your Buddies.
- Let's do it!

53:50.500 --> 53:55.200
For that little stunt,
there'll be no dinner.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.400
I bet you haven't
laughed like that in a long time.

54:05.400 --> 54:10.300
Huh? Who said that?

54:11.900 --> 54:15.100
We know all about you
at the North Pole.

54:15.100 --> 54:19.200
You didn't get a puppy when you were
a boy, and it made you hate Christmas.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.700
But Santa knew that your mother
was very allergic to dogs,

54:22.700 --> 54:26.000
that it wasn't right for your family.

54:26.400 --> 54:29.800
I know a lot of things about you,
Stan Cruge.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.200
Are you talking to me?

54:34.200 --> 54:37.500
I'm from the North Pole where we can
communicate with all creatures.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.400
It's part of the Christmas magic.

54:39.400 --> 54:43.000
And you know the best way
to heal your broken heart

54:43.000 --> 54:45.900
is to give to those in need.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.600
What has gotten into me?

54:55.600 --> 54:59.400
Christmas, sir.
Christmas has gotten into you.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.700
It's time to let Christmas
back into your heart.

55:07.400 --> 55:11.100
Well, I would love to stay for eggnog,
but I have to get back to the North Pole

55:11.100 --> 55:12.600
and help save Christmas.

55:27.400 --> 55:31.700
Uh, dawgs, it just struck me
that we ain't playin' no more.

55:31.700 --> 55:34.800
This Santa stuff is for real, yo.

55:34.800 --> 55:39.000
OK, you're all set.
We only have one shot at this,

55:39.000 --> 55:42.300
so it's important you believe you can
fly without a shadow of a doubt.

55:42.300 --> 55:45.500
- Ready, Buddies?
- That's "reindogs" to you, bro.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.800
Next stop, the North Pole.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.900
Did you see that?!

56:08.700 --> 56:10.700
They're flying.

56:13.100 --> 56:14.900
I most certainly did.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.600
And, yes, they are flying.

56:21.700 --> 56:26.700
- Whoa! This is so fly! I'm flying!
- But I'm afraid of heights!

56:26.700 --> 56:29.500
Budderball, don't look down.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.800
Yo, dawgs, there's the dog pound.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.200
Let's do a flyby.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.300
Guys, wait.

56:55.300 --> 56:58.000
Does anyone actually know
how to get to the North Pole?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.200
Just follow the North Star.

57:14.700 --> 57:17.500
The best way
to heal your broken heart

57:17.500 --> 57:21.200
is to give to those in need.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.600
- Did you feel that?
- Somewhere, somehow,

58:14.700 --> 58:18.300
somebody just decided
they believed in Christmas after all.

58:18.300 --> 58:21.800
It only takes one person
to change the lives of many.

58:21.800 --> 58:26.900
Santa Claus, I do believe the Christmas
spirit has begun its turnaround.

58:31.500 --> 58:36.000
You see, the magic is stored all year
round in the great Christmas icicle

58:36.000 --> 58:37.900
and is released at Christmas.

58:37.900 --> 58:41.000
If people don't believe in Christmas,
there isn't enough magic for us

58:41.000 --> 58:43.800
to make the toys or fly the sleigh.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.400
So, if there
isn't enough Christmas spirit,

58:46.400 --> 58:50.100
then the icicle that stores
the magic will melt and...

58:50.100 --> 58:51.900
Christmas will be gone forever?

58:51.900 --> 58:53.300
Precisely.

58:53.300 --> 58:56.200
Children will never get
to experience the joy of Santa,

58:56.200 --> 58:58.500
or learn about the spirit of Christmas.

58:58.500 --> 59:01.700
To children, you are Santa's elf.

59:01.700 --> 59:05.000
That's why your job as
an elf representative is so important.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.100
You don't actually work for us directly,

59:07.100 --> 59:09.800
but you do work
to spread Christmas spirit.

59:09.800 --> 59:13.400
And if you don't believe,
neither will the children.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.700
Wow. Thanks, Eli.

59:18.500 --> 59:22.100
See, I had no idea
my job was so darn important.

59:22.900 --> 59:24.100
Oh. Here comes my boss.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.500
That little dog is your boss?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.700
Eddy, this is Clark.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.900
- He's an official elf representative.
- Hey.

59:31.900 --> 59:34.700
Eli, we'd better get back
to the North Pole, lickety-split.

59:34.700 --> 59:37.000
Santa's gonna need
all the help he can get.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.200
- He can talk?
- Uh-huh.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.600
We don't have enough magic
to power the truck.

59:41.600 --> 59:45.900
We will soon.
Eli, things are turning around.

59:45.900 --> 59:47.300
What happened at the pound?

59:47.300 --> 59:49.900
Christmas. That's what happened.

59:52.600 --> 59:56.600
- Remember your promise, Clark.
- I will.

59:56.600 --> 59:59.000
Merry Christmas.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.600
There it is, Buddies. The North Pole.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.800
We can land right by Santa's house.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.500
Yo, don't worry, P-Squared.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.900
You are in good paws with the B-Dawg.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.900
I guess
I overshot the landing a little.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.700
You could say that again.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.000
- Dad!
- Son!

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.200
I'm so sorry for not believing.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.400
I just didn't understand
how important Christmas was.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.600
And I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.100
I should have trusted you would come
to that realization yourself.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.100
Well, it took the help of a few friends.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.600
Buddies! Nice to see you again.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
How've you been behaving, Budderball?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.200
Any more turkey infractions?

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.400
No, Mr. Paws.
I haven't even sneaked a cookie.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.800
Well, big fella, we'll have to see about
getting you off Santa's naughty list

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800
and back onto the nice list.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.000
That would make
my Christmas special, sir.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.800
I can vouch for all the good
karma Budderball has created

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.700
since the infraction in question.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.500
Your wisdom is appreciated,
Buddha. Namaste.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.100
We are totally stoked to help,
Santa Dude.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.500
Bro, that would be super rad.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.100
I'll make sure we all do everything
we can to make Christmas happen.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.700
Rosebud, your leadership skills
are exemplary.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.200
If memory serves, you're near
the very top of Santa's nice list.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.100
Thank you all for coming. We're very
behind here at Santa's workshop,

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.500
and it's going to take all the help
we can get to make Christmas happen.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.300
Easy, easy.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.300
Oh, hello!

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.600
Yo, I gotta give props to those elves.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.000
They know how to get it done.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.400
Ho-ho-ho!

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.300
We are back in business!

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.400
- Is that Santa Claus?
- Yes, that's Santa himself!

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.600
¶ It's two nights 'til Christmas ¶

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.900
¶ There's so much work
You see ¶

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.300
¶ Tie all the ribbons
Stuff all the stockings ¶

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.200
¶ Make toys with me ¶

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.700
¶ Grant every wish with every gift ¶

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.600
¶ Young hearts will lift ¶

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.600
¶ So come on
Help save Christmas with me ¶

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.500
¶ Jingle bells ring ¶

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:04.800
¶ Jingle bells ring
Jingle bells ring ¶

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.900
Puppy Paws!
Oh! It's so great to see you!

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.900
What a glorious day!

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.700
And you're right on time!

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.000
The great Christmas icicle is back!

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.100
Santa, my friends the Buddies
have come to help!

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.900
Welcome, Buddies! Ho-ho-ho!

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.300
As you can see, there's still lots of
toys to be made for children and puppies

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:34.900
all over the world. We're gonna need
all hands and paws on deck!

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.100
- We're back.
- Whoa!

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.000
That's quite a haul you've got there.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.800
From the looks of this load,
I'd say Christmas spirit is on the rise.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.400
All right, people, let's get
these letters opened on the double.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400
Christmas Eve's a-comin'.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.400
¶ There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish ¶

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.500
¶ We'll hurry up
And fill the sleigh ¶

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.800
¶ With the best things on your list ¶

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.900
¶ Santa makes it fun
He's always on the go ¶

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.000
¶ You'll know it's him
When the sleigh bells ring ¶

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.400
¶ And you hear, "ho, ho, ho" ¶

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.800
Hey, Budderball, nice haul.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.900
Hey!

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.800
Wow!

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.300
B~Dawg...

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.100
Thanks, Mr. Cruge. Merry Christmas!

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.900
- Merry Christmas!
- Ho-ho-ho!

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.700
Here it comes... Yeah! There it is!

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700
Yeah, we did it!

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.500
Yeah!

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.600
All right, Santa,
we're ready for a test flight.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.600
OK, everyone,
let's give this our best effort.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.600
Let's cross all our fingers and paws...

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.900
Go, go, go...
Come on, come on!

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.300
Come on, come on. We can do it.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.300
Comet, Donner, Blitzen! Are you OK?

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.000
Sorry, Santa Claus. We still
don't seem to have enough strength

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.300
to even fly the empty sleigh.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.500
The Christmas icicle is growing,
but not fast enough.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.700
The Buddies and I
flew the small sleigh to the North Pole

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.700
with just the little magic
that was left in my crystal.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.300
Maybe we can fly Santa's sleigh?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.500
- Whoa! What's happening?
- That's what happens to the leader.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.600
It's to light the way
for the rest of us.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.700
I think we're going to call you Ru-Dawg.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.900
Now that's tight.
My nose shines just like my bling.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.600
Prepare for departure.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.700
Good luck, son. Stay focused.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.300
Tonight is
the most important night of the year.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.300
All good children and puppies
are counting on you.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.700
No matter what happens tonight,
I want to thank you, Buddies.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.900
- You're the best friends I've ever had.
- We should thank you.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.800
We had stopped believing
in Christmas until we met you.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.100
Enough of this Kumbaya stuff.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.000
I'm in it to win it!

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.600
All right, Buddies,
it's up to us to save Christmas!

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.000
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.100
Merry Christmas.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:09:00.399
Santa, I know it's late
to be making Christmas wishes...

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:03.800
And I know I've been playing like
I don't believe in Santa Claus...

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.000
I don't need any presents.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.899
The only thing I want for Christmas...

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:13.399
...is for the Buddies
to be safe at home. Amen.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.500
"Dear Santa,

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.500
I know this is a lot to ask,

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.700
but this year if you could find a puppy

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.400
that really needs a home for Christmas,

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.100
it would change our lives.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.300
I would
take really good care of him.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.900
And he would take good care of us.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.500
I know we would be the best of friends

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.500
and I think my parents
will worry less about me

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.700
if they knew I had someone
to watch out for me.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:34.400
We live in a small brown house
at the end of Griffith Road.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.800
Merry Christmas.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.100
Love, Mikey".

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.500
Merry Christmas.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:16.600
I think you're gonna
make that boy very happy.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.900
I'll get it.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.400
Mom, Dad, look what Santa brought me!

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.900
First stop: London, England.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:54.300
OK, Dad said the magic will make my paws
stick to the side of the chimney.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.900
Wish me luck!

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.900
Paris, France.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:29.300
Love your hat. Merry Christmas.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.700
Sydney, Australia, mate.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.300
Yo, nice bling, dawg.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.300
Tokyo, Japan.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.800
This place has great feng shui.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.400
Very Zen.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The island of Jamaica.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.100
Hey, dude, gnarly dreads.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.000
- Mexico City.
- Mexico.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.800
Oh, sweet mama. Bean burritos!

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.400
Wow!

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.800
Fernfield, Washington.

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.100
Come on, Buddies!
I need all your help on this one.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.700
Oh!

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.800
Puppy Paws? Buddies? Is that you?

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.900
- Tiny?
- Yeah, it's us, Tiny.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.500
What are you doing here?

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.100
My Christmas wish came true.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.100
Mr. Cruge brought me to Mikey, my boy.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.900
I'm so happy for you, Tiny.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.600
This is the greatest Christmas ever.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.100
Well, there's no reason
why we can't make it more special.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.300
Wow! Thank you, Puppy Paws.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.200
No, Tiny, thank you.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.100
You taught us all how important it is
to believe in the Christmas spirit.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.600
None of this would have been possible
if it wasn't for you.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.600
¶ I got my Christmas miracle ¶

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.000
¶ My Christmas miracle ¶

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:14.000
¶ This year ¶

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.300
Hi, Tiny.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.300
The icicle is back to full strength.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.200
They've done it, Paws.
They've saved Christmas!

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.700
Let's round up the reindeer
and go get Puppy Paws.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.700
That's it, Buddies.
That was our last delivery.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.000
- We did it!
- Uh, dude?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.900
How are you gonna get home
with no one to fly your sleigh?

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.400
Ho-ho-ho!

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.200
I think I've got a ride.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.900
Whoa, Cupid! Whoa, Donner!
Whoa, Blitzen! Whoa!

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:44.400
Great work, pups!
The North Pole is back in business!

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400
You did it, son. You saved Christmas.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.800
I couldn't have done it
without the Buddies.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:00.500
Indeed. Your teamwork tonight was most
certainly top of the nice list material.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.900
Which is why, Buddies,

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.300
we at the North Pole
have decided to present to you

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:10.300
your very own, genuine Santa hats.

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.000
Merry Christmas, Buddies.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.900
And there's one more thing.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.100
- You earned this, son.
- Whoa!

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.400
You're one of us now, young pup.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.200
And with you on our team,
I think it's pretty safe to say

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.400
that Christmas is going to be in very
good hands for a long time to come.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.200
I'm proud of you.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.000
Now say your goodbyes, Puppy Paws.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.100
We've got to keep the spirit of
Christmas alive all year long.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:46.100
Only 364 days 'til next Christmas!

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.100
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.600
Puppy Paws, you know how
you wanted to be an ordinary pup?

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.100
- Yeah?
- That's impossible.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.300
You're too extraordinary to be ordinary.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.500
I feel the same way about you, Buddies.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.900
Thank you for making us true believers.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.600
And for taking us
on a way cool adventure.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.600
Best time ever!
All you can eat cookies and milk?

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.900
- Sign me up!
- Yo, Puppy Paws,

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.400
you are now officially
part of the B-Dawg Nation.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.200
You now have four bros and one sis.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.200
Maybe you Buddies
can lend a paw next year

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.200
as official Santa's Helpers.
What do you say?

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.400
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.200
- Fo' shizzle!
- Now, Buddies,

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.900
you'd better get home to your kids.

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.800
You still have
some Christmas wishes to fulfill,

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.200
and we've got to get back
to the North Pole. Let's go, Paws!

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.000
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Merry Christmas!

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.600
Ho-ho-ho! On, Comet! On, Cupid!

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.700
On, Donner! On, Blitzen!

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.000
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!
Now, Prancer and Vixen!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.800
Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho!

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.400
Ho-ho-ho!

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
Budderball!

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.400
I've missed you so much!

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.200
Hello?

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.900
Sorry to disturb you, but we were
wondering if you'd join us for dinner.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.700
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't want to impose.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.900
Besides, I've got
a lot of work to do here, you know.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.300
But it's Christmas, sir.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.200
Oh... I'll go grab my coat.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.700
I'm starving.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.600
Stan, thank you.
It's great to have you here.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.300
Thank you for spending
Christmas with us.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.400
¶ Silent night ¶

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.400
