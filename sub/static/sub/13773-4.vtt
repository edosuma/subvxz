There's always somebody.

There is always somebody to blame.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.020
And this week, it's Antonio Gates.

00:13.196 --> 00:17.360
I'm going into the final game of the week,
up by 39 points.

00:17.534 --> 00:19.161
You screwed me, Antonio Gates.

00:19.335 --> 00:20.495
You screwed me hard.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.433
A good player. I grant you that.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.097
Ten points a game. Sure.
Twenty points, even. Absolutely.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.710
And all of a sudden,
this guy comes out of nowhere...

00:28.878 --> 00:33.542
...scores four touchdowns,
gains 200 yards.

I hope this guy gets mouth cancer.

- It's almost better when he wins.

Oh, by the way, did you know
you have to choose a lineup every week?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.459
- Do I have to do that?
KEVIN: Please, do that.

09:12.532 --> 09:15.467
- Ugh. It smells like cat food in there.
- What were you thinking?

09:15.635 --> 09:16.829
This is a cleaver.

09:17.003 --> 09:20.530
I was gonna bring nunchucks.
I didn't think she'd know what they were.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.072
Taco, no weapons.
I'm gonna go to bed in a while.

09:23.242 --> 09:26.370
Hang out in the basement.
In about an hour, go up to Ellie's room...

09:26.546 --> 09:28.446
...open the door, scare her a little bit.

09:28.614 --> 09:29.876
- Okay.
- Just to the point...

09:30.049 --> 09:32.711
...that she never wants to see, look at...

09:32.885 --> 09:36.082
...or even be around
the Mr. McGibblets ever again.

09:36.255 --> 09:38.689
Oh, by the way, can I keep this
for a little bit?

09:38.858 --> 09:41.383
It's getting chilly in my apartment.
They cut the heat.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.825
I only rented it for two days.
We got a deal?

09:49.101 --> 09:50.432
Deal.

09:50.937 --> 09:51.995
Sleep tight, brother.

09:52.171 --> 09:52.830

09:56.258 --> 09:58.317
I'm looking at my wardrobe, and I'm like,
I would like to be able to dress better too.

09:58.493 --> 10:00.552
And I like the way that
you just own it, man.

10:00.729 --> 10:03.698
You know, I mean, whatever.
I like to shop and I like fashion.

10:03.865 --> 10:07.460
- You look good in it. I'm wondering...
- I'll take you. We'll go shopping.

10:07.636 --> 10:11.299
I don't wanna sound corny, but it's nice,
you and I having one-on-one time.

10:11.473 --> 10:14.033
- Definitely.
- We rarely get to do this. I'm enjoying it.

10:14.209 --> 10:15.574
- I gotta say.
- Me too. Friend.

10:15.744 --> 10:19.805
Now that I think about it, I wonder
if there's a trade somewhere for you and...

10:19.982 --> 10:21.609
- No, no, no. No trade, okay?
- Why?

10:21.783 --> 10:24.411
- Because last year, you trade-raped me.
- I did not.

10:24.586 --> 10:26.315
- You raped me.
- It was not trade rape.

10:26.488 --> 10:29.480
It was like a bad date, maybe.
But it was consensual.

10:29.658 --> 10:31.421
Consensual my ass, okay?

10:31.593 --> 10:35.290
You jumped out of the bushes, ripped
down my panties, and trade-raped me.

10:35.464 --> 10:37.762
All right.
Maybe last year was a trade rape.

10:37.933 --> 10:41.061
But this year, my intentions are pure.

10:41.236 --> 10:43.204
You are a completely different player.

10:43.372 --> 10:48.275
You're playing with intelligence and tenacity
that is unprecedented in this league.

10:48.443 --> 10:50.035
- You think?
- I got a trade in mind.

10:50.212 --> 10:53.045
It helps you, it helps me.
We both go to the playoffs.

- Pete trade-raped you.

18:56.942 --> 18:59.206
- You've been trade-raped.
- He did not trade-rape me.

18:59.378 --> 19:01.710

Ehh! Answer is zero. Because the guy
is in jail for two years, you moron.

Unless you're playing
a two-year-down-the-line league, you're out.

- How did you not hear it?

19:15.728 --> 19:17.821
I heard about it.
I didn't think it was that guy.

19:17.997 --> 19:19.021
That's him.

19:19.198 --> 19:20.961
- This is your fault. Yeah.
- My fault?

19:21.133 --> 19:24.364
What two grown men do during
a couples massage is their own business.

19:24.537 --> 19:26.869
He told me I could trust him.

19:27.039 --> 19:29.940
- We were gonna go shopping together.
- You're such an idiot.

19:30.109 --> 19:31.974
- From the mouth of babes.
- No.

KEVIN:
You're so stupid.

19:33.612 --> 19:35.773
CLAIRE:
So these are the secret gardens.

19:35.948 --> 19:38.416
It's a really nice private place...

19:38.584 --> 19:40.609
...to come and spend a few hours.
- Yeah.

19:40.786 --> 19:44.187
- And that's the kissing bridge, over there.
- Ah.

19:44.523 --> 19:47.356
The old kissing bridge.

19:47.526 --> 19:49.687
Yeah. It's a great place to read.

19:50.663 --> 19:53.723
It's really nice in the morning.
We have a tai chi class out here.

19:53.899 --> 19:58.029
And people enjoy watching that,
or yoga if that's more to your preference.

19:58.204 --> 19:59.899
Got it. Right.

20:00.072 --> 20:03.439
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna try something.

20:10.866 --> 20:13.266
- Finally.
- Okay. That's not part of your job, right?

20:13.435 --> 20:15.164
No, my shift ended 20 minutes ago.

20:15.337 --> 20:18.898
Okay. Good. Okay. All right.
There was some confusing jargon there.

20:19.074 --> 20:22.339
- Just habit to... Yeah.
- Yeah, oh, okay.

- I can't wait.

20:28.684 --> 20:31.050
PETE: I need an upgrade, by the way.
- Oh.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.949
- Andre.
ANDRE: I'm sorry.

20:33.122 --> 20:37.024
PETE: No. Turn that off.
- That's you having sex.

20:37.192 --> 20:40.821
PETE: He's drunk. Don't pay attention to that.
CLAIRE: That's still you having sex.

20:40.996 --> 20:43.692
- I thought it was <i>Benjamin Button.</i>
- That's gross.

20:43.866 --> 20:46.357
PETE: Turn it off.
- I'm gonna... I gotta go.

20:46.535 --> 20:49.663
It looks rough, but it's beautiful.
They are beautiful creatures.

20:49.838 --> 20:52.398
If you need anything else,
just call the front desk.

20:52.574 --> 20:57.204
I wouldn't have done this if your
pay-per-view movies were reasonably priced.

20:57.379 --> 20:59.711
Not number-one friend material,
by the way.

20:59.882 --> 21:02.680
How much of me having sex
did you actually watch?

21:02.851 --> 21:04.512
The whole Kournikova.

21:09.158 --> 21:11.854
Ruxin's sleep bong is awesome.

21:12.027 --> 21:14.257
Hey, you're on TV, man.

21:16.064 --> 21:18.862

21:29.211 --> 21:31.406
- How are you, man?
- Nice to meet you, man.

21:31.580 --> 21:34.208
I cannot believe
you just got into this hot tub.

21:34.383 --> 21:37.546
- What are you doing here?
- Just bye week. Visiting some family.

21:37.719 --> 21:38.981
RUXIN: All right.
- Relaxing.

21:39.154 --> 21:40.485
RUXIN: Chilling.
- Yeah.

21:40.656 --> 21:43.181
Well, I can't tell you how excited I am
to meet you.

21:43.358 --> 21:46.259
Because I have been cursing your name
all week long.

21:46.428 --> 21:48.862
And now I get to yell at you in person.

21:49.031 --> 21:50.828
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

21:50.999 --> 21:53.433
You ruined my Fantasy Football team
this week.

21:53.602 --> 21:56.036
I'm just doing my job.
My job is to go play football.

21:56.205 --> 21:59.572
Well, when you catch balls,
it has a negative effect on my team.

21:59.741 --> 22:02.005
You ravaged my Fantasy Football team.

22:02.177 --> 22:03.201
- You know what?
- What?

22:03.378 --> 22:07.337
I didn't know that. But now that I met you,
I'm happy that it turned out that way.

22:07.516 --> 22:10.679
- I don't like your tone, sir.
- You're an angry little man.

22:10.852 --> 22:13.753
- I'm about to get angry all up in your face.
- Yeah?

22:13.922 --> 22:16.823
- Yeah.
- I told you Ruxin would wreck the weekend.

22:16.992 --> 22:20.826
Wrecked? The guy took a punch in the face
from Antonio Gates. Put it up.

22:20.996 --> 22:23.965
Well, actually I slapped him
and then fell running away. But...

PETE: You know.

22:25.934 --> 22:28.402
- I like this spa. That was relaxing.
- Shut up, Taco.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.934
Yeah, we're never gonna hear the end
of this Ruxin-Antonio Gates thing.

22:36.111 --> 22:39.308
I'm returning all the McGibblets stuff
before Jenny comes home.

22:39.481 --> 22:41.949
The good news is
Taco didn't kill Ellie so...

- Oh, God.
- Got you, you sick son of a bitch.

22:44.486 --> 22:47.284
KEVIN: Hold on. What are you doing?
- Call headquarters.
