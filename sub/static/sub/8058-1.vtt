WEBVTT

00:00.359 --> 00:01.672
Wait, I forgot!

00:01.968 --> 00:03.814
- Who the hell is pregnant?
- What?

00:03.934 --> 00:06.762
I found a pregnancy test at your cabin
and I checked with all the girls over there

00:07.096 --> 00:09.226
and wasn't any of them.

00:09.461 --> 00:11.591
Hello, darling, what a surprise.

00:11.711 --> 00:15.219
Hey. Can we talk?
Maybe in private.

00:20.371 --> 00:21.212
You and me?

00:21.332 --> 00:23.475
I believe
she's referring to me, son.

00:23.723 --> 00:26.290
Please excuse us.

00:26.341 --> 00:30.477
So I...am pregnant.

00:31.679 --> 00:33.263
I see.

00:33.298 --> 00:35.649
I don't understand how.
We were so careful.

00:35.683 --> 00:37.034
I warned you about this.

00:37.068 --> 00:38.819
Standard birth control methods

00:38.853 --> 00:41.288
aren't usually effective
against a Swanson.

00:41.306 --> 00:43.573
I got about a million thoughts
running around in my head,

00:43.608 --> 00:47.461
but I really just want to know
what you're thinking.

00:47.495 --> 00:51.131
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

00:51.165 --> 00:52.950
I was gonna wait
until our anniversary,

00:52.984 --> 00:55.752
take you somewhere romantic,
perhaps in a canoe--

00:55.803 --> 00:57.804
most likely in a canoe.

00:57.839 --> 01:00.207
I actually built a canoe
for that purpose,

01:00.241 --> 01:03.126
but given the news, and given

01:03.161 --> 01:07.914
my significant feelings
for you,

01:07.949 --> 01:09.800
now seems as good a time
as any.

01:09.834 --> 01:12.152
Ron Swanson.

01:12.186 --> 01:16.323
Diane Lewis...

01:16.357 --> 01:19.159
will you marry me?

01:19.193 --> 01:21.261
Yes.

01:21.279 --> 01:23.330
- On one condition.
- Anything, my love.

01:23.364 --> 01:24.731
Ask me for anything
in the world,

01:24.749 --> 01:25.999
and I'll give it to you,

01:26.033 --> 01:27.901
except a destination wedding.

01:27.935 --> 01:30.904
Just the opposite.
We've both been married before.

01:30.938 --> 01:33.106
I don't want anything big
or elaborate.

01:33.124 --> 01:34.891
In fact,
the smaller the better.

01:34.926 --> 01:36.376
I assume
you can deal with that.

01:36.394 --> 01:37.728
Are you kidding?

01:37.779 --> 01:38.895
As far as I'm concerned,

01:38.946 --> 01:42.716
we could go up
to the fourth floor right now.

01:44.218 --> 01:45.652
Well, hello there.

01:45.687 --> 01:47.437
Hey, Leslie.
What's with the getup?

01:47.488 --> 01:49.528
We're coming back from
cleaning up the Pawnee River.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.591
There's nothing I love more
than squeegeeing slime

01:51.625 --> 01:52.592
off a highway underpass.

01:52.626 --> 01:54.094
Where are you guys going?

01:54.112 --> 01:55.829
The fourth floor,
getting married.

01:55.863 --> 01:57.748
Okey-dokey.
Well, catch you later.

01:57.799 --> 02:00.467
What? Wha--

02:00.501 --> 02:03.904
What--who's--
what the--

02:03.938 --> 02:06.706
Are you dead?
You look like you're in rictus.

02:06.724 --> 02:08.859
I just--I'm having
so many thoughts and feelings

02:08.893 --> 02:10.810
that I'm paralyzed right now.

02:10.828 --> 02:12.112
Would you ladies like to come?

02:12.130 --> 02:14.381
- Can I be the best man?
- Why not? Let's go.

02:14.415 --> 02:16.483
Ron is getting married,
and I love him,

02:16.517 --> 02:18.618
and I care about him, and this
is the greatest day ever,

02:18.653 --> 02:20.320
and I do not have time
to talk about this!

02:20.338 --> 02:21.321
Wait!

02:22.790 --> 02:24.624
If you would just
slow down a little,

02:24.642 --> 02:26.943
then I could arrange balloons
or a flower cake

02:26.994 --> 02:28.578
- or a bouncy castle--
- Ah!

02:28.629 --> 02:29.913
Ethel Beavers, we would like

02:29.964 --> 02:31.998
a marriage license,
please and thank you.

02:32.016 --> 02:33.466
What's the date of the wedding?

02:33.484 --> 02:35.402
- Today.
- It's a bit unusual,

02:35.436 --> 02:37.371
- but we both--
- Don't care.

02:37.405 --> 02:40.507
Leslie Knope, would you please
be my matron of honor?

02:40.525 --> 02:44.611
Diane, you have no idea
what that means to me.

02:44.629 --> 02:45.846
She gets it.
Let's go.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.882
Well, this is like
a waking nightmare...

02:48.900 --> 02:51.501
of happiness.
I need to get some flowers.

02:51.536 --> 02:54.788
Why don't you hold this colorful
bouquet of highlighters?

02:54.822 --> 02:56.890
Rice, I need to find some rice,
I need to throw some rice.

02:56.924 --> 02:59.592
Why is there no rice in this
municipal government building?

02:59.610 --> 03:01.611
I found a justice guy.
These are the marrying people.

03:01.646 --> 03:02.963
- This is Carl.
- Hello, Carl.

03:02.997 --> 03:04.637
My fiancee and I
would like to get married

03:04.665 --> 03:05.882
right now, right here.

03:05.933 --> 03:07.813
Haven't I done a quickie
wedding for you before?

03:07.819 --> 03:10.887
It's certainly possible,
but this one's going to stick.

03:10.922 --> 03:13.123
I need your full names
for the license.

03:13.157 --> 03:16.893
- Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
- Diane Tammy Lewis.

03:16.944 --> 03:18.245
Tammy?

03:18.279 --> 03:20.747
- Your middle name is--
- Just kidding, it's Elizabeth.

03:20.781 --> 03:22.099
- Let's go, Carl.
- Hey, hey.

03:22.133 --> 03:23.800
Let's pump the brakes,
Carl, okay?

03:23.851 --> 03:26.736
Belay that order, Carl.
Shortest possible ceremony.

03:26.788 --> 03:28.655
I'm tired of not being married
to this woman.

03:28.689 --> 03:30.290
Do you, Ron Swanson,
take Diane to be your wife?

03:30.324 --> 03:32.125
Ooh, it's going to start!
Ooh, it's happening!

03:32.126 --> 03:33.176
- I certainly do.
- Oh, my God!

03:33.227 --> 03:34.294
- And do you, Diane, take--
- Yes!

03:34.312 --> 03:35.579
- Yes, I do.
- She said yes!

03:35.613 --> 03:36.896
- Okay.
- Wait!

03:36.914 --> 03:39.032
- By the power vested in me--
- Before you--

03:39.066 --> 03:40.333
Carl, just one second.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.918
I would just like to give
a short speech, if I may.

03:41.969 --> 03:43.320
You have ten seconds.

03:43.354 --> 03:45.238
At first glance, it may seem

03:45.273 --> 03:48.208
as though Ron Swanson and I
have nothing in common,

03:48.242 --> 03:50.076
but Webster's dictionary
defines "friend--"

03:50.094 --> 03:51.211
- Time.
- It's--ugh!

03:51.229 --> 03:52.596
Thank you, Leslie.

03:52.647 --> 03:53.897
I could tell
where you were going with that,

03:53.931 --> 03:55.131
and it was gonna be beautiful.

03:55.149 --> 03:56.666
- I now pronounce you...
- Oh!

03:56.701 --> 03:57.650
man and wife.

03:57.668 --> 03:59.619
Hooray!

03:59.637 --> 04:00.620
Yay!

04:00.638 --> 04:01.721
Great job, everyone.

04:01.756 --> 04:02.973
The reception will be held

04:03.024 --> 04:04.975
in each
of our individual houses, alone.

04:05.026 --> 04:07.461
Pretend this is rice!

04:07.495 --> 04:10.497
That was beautiful.

04:13.484 --> 04:23.665
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:30.768 --> 04:32.802
The people who want
to boot me from office

04:32.837 --> 04:34.704
have been viciously attacking me
for weeks.

04:34.739 --> 04:37.491
Recall Knope!
Recall Knope!

04:37.525 --> 04:39.125
Legalize weed!

04:39.159 --> 04:40.393
Last week, I was an answer

04:40.428 --> 04:42.295
in the <i>Pawnee Journal's</i>
<i>Crossword Puzzle.</i>

04:42.330 --> 04:44.698
The clue--"Who's the worst,"
but you know what?

04:44.732 --> 04:46.082
We're fighting back.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.635
I've broken my defense
initiative into 40 phases.

04:48.669 --> 04:52.956
We are currently in phase 26:
"No problem too small."

04:52.990 --> 04:55.926
Anyone can come to me any time
with any problem,

04:55.960 --> 04:57.243
no matter how petty or small,

04:57.261 --> 05:00.564
and I will fix it personally,
and let me tell you,

05:00.598 --> 05:03.133
some of these complaints
are pretty damn petty and small.

05:03.167 --> 05:06.486
Okay, Gretel,
how can I help you today?

05:06.504 --> 05:08.305
There are slugs everywhere
on the sidewalk

05:08.339 --> 05:09.455
in front of my house.

05:09.473 --> 05:12.559
I want them gone
but not killed--I love animals.

05:12.593 --> 05:14.361
But get rid of them.
They're gross.

05:14.395 --> 05:17.830
But make sure they're happy
but not too happy.

05:17.848 --> 05:22.903
Well, we're on it,
because "No problem too small."

05:22.937 --> 05:24.170
So what now?

05:24.205 --> 05:25.622
Well, I have
about 30 more people

05:25.673 --> 05:27.874
who want to come into my office
and complain to my face.

05:27.908 --> 05:28.842
- Leslie Knope!
- Oh!

05:28.876 --> 05:30.527
Ann Perkins. Mm.

05:30.561 --> 05:31.945
How's the recall fight going?

05:31.979 --> 05:33.113
This person-to-person
campaigning

05:33.147 --> 05:34.581
is kind of wearing me down.

05:34.615 --> 05:36.383
Well, as a wise woman
once said to me,

05:36.417 --> 05:40.053
"Ann, you cunning, pliable,
chestnut-haired sunfish,

05:40.087 --> 05:41.805
phase 26
is the key to my plan."

05:41.856 --> 05:43.873
Good memory, sunfish.
Let's press on.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.859
I have to come up with some
solution for this slug problem.

05:46.877 --> 05:49.963
Someone has a slug infestation?

05:49.997 --> 05:51.932
Boy, oh, boy,
we live interesting lives,

05:51.966 --> 05:53.433
filled
with unexpected challenges.

05:53.451 --> 05:55.368
Life is precious, and every day

05:55.403 --> 05:58.421
is a miracle.

05:58.456 --> 06:01.625
Okay.

06:01.676 --> 06:03.009
What a freak.

06:03.043 --> 06:05.946
Things with me and Chris
are going really well.

06:05.980 --> 06:08.481
We spend every day together,
and we're having so much fun.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.468
And check this out.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.304
Oh, no, there's no ring.

06:14.338 --> 06:16.523
We just had manicures
together recently.

06:16.557 --> 06:19.376
Sorry, that was misleading.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.848
Ah, Mr. Haverford,
back again, I see.

06:24.882 --> 06:25.815
What the hell, man?

06:25.850 --> 06:26.833
This looks
exactly like my store!

06:26.851 --> 06:28.001
I know.

06:28.019 --> 06:29.769
My client is
a very determined businessman.

06:29.803 --> 06:31.454
When he rips someone off,
he goes all the way.

06:31.489 --> 06:35.492
You see, you are Hydrox,
Mr. Haverford.

06:35.543 --> 06:37.110
We are Oreo.

06:37.128 --> 06:39.245
Your mysterious, unnamed client

06:39.279 --> 06:40.547
seems like
a pretty intense guy.

06:40.581 --> 06:43.133
I am impressed by how quickly
he was able to move

06:43.167 --> 06:45.135
such a large amount
of merchandise.

06:45.169 --> 06:46.586
- Mm.
- He must be

06:46.620 --> 06:49.139
one heck of a transporter.

06:49.173 --> 06:51.141
My client is not Jason Statham,

06:51.175 --> 06:52.225
if that's what you're thinking.

06:52.259 --> 06:54.561
Some mysterious
big shot investor

06:54.595 --> 06:56.980
has opened up a store
directly across the street

06:57.014 --> 06:58.974
from rent-a-swag to try
to put me out of business.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.233
I'm not worried, though.

07:00.267 --> 07:02.402
I've poured my heart and soul
into my store.

07:02.436 --> 07:04.321
I'm sure this guy's just looking
for a place to store

07:04.355 --> 07:06.523
all his NBA championship
trophies.

07:06.574 --> 07:09.175
- It's not Lebron James.
- Damn.

07:09.210 --> 07:11.411
Well, I hate to say this, gang,

07:11.445 --> 07:14.280
but I don't think "No problem
too small" is working.

07:14.314 --> 07:15.598
I mean, there's been
no press coverage,

07:15.633 --> 07:17.033
no change in my poll numbers.

07:17.084 --> 07:19.919
I agree, we need something
massive and attention-getting,

07:19.954 --> 07:21.838
something that will
grab people by the ears,

07:21.872 --> 07:23.456
yell at them
through a bullhorn,

07:23.490 --> 07:25.258
and hit them
like a bolt of lightning.

07:25.292 --> 07:26.760
- I got it!
- What is it?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.828
Oh, no, I just--
I got a fly.

07:28.846 --> 07:30.463
I have something.

07:30.497 --> 07:34.517
Remember phase 13,
"Think outside of the box"?

07:34.552 --> 07:35.802
Of course.
It was an amazing phase.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.270
Easily a top five phase.

07:37.304 --> 07:39.055
Well, I thought
outside of the box,

07:39.106 --> 07:41.224
and I nominated you
for this big award.

07:41.275 --> 07:42.508
It's called

07:42.526 --> 07:44.177
"The International Coalition
of Women in Government,"

07:44.195 --> 07:47.280
and you won.

07:47.314 --> 07:48.965
There's, like, five winners,

07:48.999 --> 07:50.479
and you get a big trophy
or something.

07:50.484 --> 07:52.986
Oh, my God, this is real.
I just assumed you were lying.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.455
Thank you, but yeah, it's real.

07:55.489 --> 07:58.524
Ann Richards won it once,
and Janet Napolitano, I think.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.661
Janet Napoli-fraking-tano?
Oh, my God.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.380
This is amazing and perfect.

08:03.414 --> 08:05.882
This is exactly
the kind of big, splashy thing

08:05.916 --> 08:07.250
that's gonna get
the voters' attention.

08:07.301 --> 08:08.334
When is the ceremony?

08:08.368 --> 08:11.704
- Next month...in London.
- London?

08:11.722 --> 08:14.808
- London?
- We're going to London?

08:14.842 --> 08:17.093
We're going to London,
you guys!

08:21.251 --> 08:22.769
I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!

08:23.103 --> 08:25.671
No, that's Buckingham Palace.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.757
Hogwarts is fictional.
Do you know that?

08:28.775 --> 08:31.160
It's important to me
that you know that.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.712
Okay, guys, we are going to be
sightseeing today.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.147
Andy and Ben are gonna go
to their meeting,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.916
and then we're gonna go
back to the hotel for lunch,

08:36.950 --> 08:40.336
and I will spend the day getting
to know London's history.

08:40.370 --> 08:43.739
History began on July 4, 1776.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.975
Everything before that
was a mistake.

08:45.993 --> 08:50.780
Diane suggested we "tag along
to London" for a honeymoon.

08:50.814 --> 08:53.082
I agreed,
because my love for her

08:53.116 --> 08:55.351
trumps my hatred for Europe.

08:55.385 --> 08:57.603
Then she hit
a phase of morning sickness

08:57.638 --> 09:00.589
that knocked her for a loop
and decided to stay home,

09:00.624 --> 09:05.144
but she insisted I go
and take pictures for her.

09:05.195 --> 09:06.556
All of this
could have been avoided

09:06.580 --> 09:08.464
if we'd followed my plan
for a honeymoon:

09:08.498 --> 09:09.798
a steak dinner,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.567
a glass of Lagavulin whiskey,

09:11.601 --> 09:13.986
then vigorous lovemaking
for two hours,

09:14.021 --> 09:16.122
and we're both asleep
by 8:30.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.556
Hey, Leslie, we're gonna
head to the meeting.

09:17.607 --> 09:18.557
Are you okay?

09:18.608 --> 09:19.942
Yeah, I know it's weird,

09:19.976 --> 09:22.294
but I kind of feel bad
about leaving Pawnee.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.014
It's like leaving my kid at home
without a babysitter.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.449
Leslie, you're in London.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.968
You're 4,000 miles
away from home.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.171
- Try to enjoy this, okay?
- Yeah, you're right, as usual.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.139
Good luck.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.093
Ooh, hey...

09:37.127 --> 09:39.679
boss man,
I want to go home early.

09:39.730 --> 09:40.663
Ooh, hold on, actually.

09:40.697 --> 09:41.947
Hang on.
Yeah, no.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.533
I want to quit
and never come here again.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.118
Okay, bye.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.970
I can't believe
I used to date you!

09:48.004 --> 09:49.105
Tommy Pickles!

09:49.139 --> 09:50.539
You see
there's a better version

09:50.574 --> 09:52.058
of your store
across the street?

09:52.092 --> 09:55.111
And those guys are giving out
free pizza with "papperonas."

09:55.145 --> 09:56.662
I know, man.
That's my competition.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.614
They're trying to put me out
of business, and it's working.

09:58.648 --> 10:01.083
Three weeks ago,
this place was hopping.

10:01.118 --> 10:02.735
My clothes were flying
off the rack.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.538
I was spreading swag around town
like a killer swag virus.

10:05.589 --> 10:08.424
Now, look at this place.
It's dead!

10:08.442 --> 10:09.442
What am I gonna do?

10:09.493 --> 10:11.060
It's like I always say, okay?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.495
When life gives you lemons,

10:12.529 --> 10:14.096
you sell
some of your grandma's jewelry,

10:14.131 --> 10:15.164
and you go clubbing.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.866
That's not
a good piece of advice.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.368
So I'ma throw up.
I ate too much cheese.

10:19.403 --> 10:20.602
I'll talk to you!

10:20.620 --> 10:23.355
I need some better friends.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.442
So the only thing you did
was stop drinking beer?

10:26.476 --> 10:28.711
Yeah, I lost 50 pounds
in one month.

10:28.745 --> 10:30.296
How much beer
were you drinking?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.880
I know, right?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.566
Probably too much.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.267
Andy and I are meeting with
an English charity foundation

10:35.302 --> 10:38.254
to expand
our after-school music program,

10:38.288 --> 10:40.106
and British people love me.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.124
There was this British kid
in my high school

10:42.158 --> 10:43.709
who always called me "Big Ben"

10:43.760 --> 10:46.695
and would punch me really hard
on the arm,

10:46.730 --> 10:50.599
and go, "Bong! Bong! Bo--"

10:50.634 --> 10:52.518
Oh, he might have hated me.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.203
Real quick,
should I do a British accent?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.939
- Um, I'm gonna say no.
- You sure?

10:56.973 --> 10:58.257
- Yeah.
- I can do one.

10:58.308 --> 11:00.276
It's not very good,
but I think I could pull it off.

11:00.310 --> 11:01.977
I just feel like
he's gonna get upset

11:01.995 --> 11:03.879
when he finds out
that we're American.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.481
He knows we're American.

11:05.515 --> 11:07.366
Ugh, great.
All right, well,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.218
I guess we'll take
the meeting anyway.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.586
After all,

11:10.620 --> 11:12.121
we did come all the way
down under.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.922
No.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.826
Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.514
This is Andy Dwyer, and it is
an honor to meet you, sir.

11:21.565 --> 11:22.715
Well,
it's nice to meet you too.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.334
However, the proper mode
of address would be

11:25.368 --> 11:28.104
"Your Royal Excellency,
Lord Edgar Darby Covington,

11:28.138 --> 11:30.372
"14th Earl
of Cornwall-upon-Thames,

11:30.407 --> 11:33.809
29th Baron
of Hertfordshire."

11:33.844 --> 11:35.394
No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.645
- Oh!
- Please, call me Eddie.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.581
Oh, thank God.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.449
I knew that other name
must have been a stupid joke.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.783
Andy--

11:41.802 --> 11:43.102
No, no, no, no,
he's absolutely right,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.704
it's an absurd name.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.592
Well, I'm excited to hear
about your musical charity idea.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.894
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.446
The <i>Notting Hill</i> bus tour
starts at 2:00,

11:54.498 --> 11:56.832
the <i>Love Actually</i> bus tour
starts at 2:30,

11:56.867 --> 12:00.269
and--oh, the <i>Bridget Jones</i>
bus tour starts at 2:30 also.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.289
What do we do?
Ron, your pick.

12:04.674 --> 12:08.310
Look, a clock.
We don't have that in America.

12:08.344 --> 12:11.163
You call that a tower?

12:11.198 --> 12:13.265
Try the Sears Tower, friend.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.301
"London at night."

12:15.352 --> 12:17.386
That is very funny.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.387
Can I help you, sir?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.307
Yes.
I will take this.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.292
We don't accept
American currency, sir.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.643
Of course you do.

12:24.694 --> 12:26.228
That's the most wonderful piece
of paper in the world.

12:26.262 --> 12:27.229
Accept it.

12:27.263 --> 12:28.531
Very sorry, sir.

12:28.565 --> 12:30.049
Fine.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.318
Enjoy the fact
that your royal overlords

12:32.352 --> 12:35.487
are a frail, old woman
and a tiny baby.

12:38.836 --> 12:40.356
You really think
this will work, Donna?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.343
Why wouldn't it?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.578
We just pull
the business license--

12:42.612 --> 12:43.746
it's public information--

12:43.780 --> 12:45.497
and then at least
you'll have an address.

12:45.549 --> 12:47.633
Ooh, here.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.186
Hmm, some kind of shady,
fake shell corporation

12:50.220 --> 12:53.322
- called "Open 4 Business, LLC."
- Thanks, Donna.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.641
Hey, if it's Akon
and y'all become best friends,

12:55.675 --> 12:57.393
I want a ride on his plane.

12:57.427 --> 13:00.262
- Done and done.
- Nice.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.215
"1020 Maple Street."

13:05.335 --> 13:08.287
Ann and Chris?
What are they doing here?

13:11.374 --> 13:12.958
Sir, you can't go in there!

13:13.009 --> 13:15.277
Aha!
I caught you!

13:15.312 --> 13:18.314
- Hey, it's Tom!
- What the hell are you doing?

13:18.348 --> 13:20.216
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?

13:20.250 --> 13:23.418
Dr. Saperstein
is giving me a sonogram,

13:23.436 --> 13:26.488
in his doctor's office,
for women, because I'm pregnant!

13:26.523 --> 13:28.874
Oh, my God.

13:28.925 --> 13:30.976
- You're Jean-Ralphio's dad!
- Mm-hmm.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.878
You're the one that's trying
to put me out of business!

13:32.913 --> 13:34.196
Well, look at that,
Mr. Haverford.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.331
You tracked me down.

13:35.365 --> 13:37.466
Looks like your detective skills
are a lot better

13:37.500 --> 13:40.802
than your tween,
high-end fashion rental skills.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.421
Ann, Chris,
can we have the room, please?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.006
No, you certainly cannot.

13:44.040 --> 13:44.974
Dr. Saperstein,
why are you doing this?

13:45.008 --> 13:46.141
What did I ever do to you?

13:46.176 --> 13:48.060
You know exactly
why I'm doing this.

13:48.111 --> 13:49.828
You destroyed my family.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.880
First, you screwed my son
out of your business,

13:51.914 --> 13:54.300
and then you stole
my daughter's virginity.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:06.496 --> 14:08.080
Wait, you're serious?

14:08.131 --> 14:09.298
Deadly serious.

14:09.332 --> 14:11.466
According to my daughter,
you broke her heart.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.385
Then you smashed up her BMW.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.603
I had to buy her a new one,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.305
so she could drive
to Divinity School.

14:16.339 --> 14:17.673
Let me tell you something,
mister.

14:17.707 --> 14:20.726
You attack a Saperstein,
you face my wrath.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.112
Be so sure about this,
Tiny Tom,

14:23.146 --> 14:26.298
that I will crush you
like the bug you are...

14:27.651 --> 14:30.569
And there it is, the heartbeat.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.504
- Ohh.
- Everything sounds perfect.

14:32.555 --> 14:33.622
Ohh.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.891
This is the moment
we were dreaming of:

14:35.925 --> 14:39.078
you and me and our baby.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.581
And Tom and his weird feud
with our doctor.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.316
So this after-school
music program

14:44.351 --> 14:46.301
has been really successful
in Pawnee,

14:46.319 --> 14:49.154
and we've expanded it
to eight other towns in Indiana,

14:49.205 --> 14:51.340
but we feel with your help,
we can--

14:51.374 --> 14:53.676
Whoa! Are those--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:53.710 --> 14:54.927
Are those
remote control helicopters?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.445
- Yeah.
- What?

14:56.479 --> 14:58.197
I got them as a gift.

14:58.248 --> 15:00.316
I bought them
for one of my nephews,

15:00.350 --> 15:01.616
- and then I decided to keep them.
- Yeah.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.617
Would you like to play
with them?

15:02.635 --> 15:04.419
Oh, would I?
I call blue one!

15:04.437 --> 15:05.938
I call the--
oh.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.356
Okay, you get the blue one.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.358
Andy, we are guests
of Lord Covington.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.427
Maybe you should let him...

15:11.461 --> 15:12.845
play with the blue helicopter.

15:12.896 --> 15:14.263
What are you talking about,
dude?

15:14.297 --> 15:16.198
- I called it.
- He called it.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.700
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.201
Anyway,
the orange one's better.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.169
- What?
- Come on.

15:20.203 --> 15:21.637
Aah!

15:22.689 --> 15:26.158
Hey, get off!

15:26.209 --> 15:27.676
Okay, watch out!
Watch out!

15:27.711 --> 15:28.677
- Agh!
- Ohh!

15:28.712 --> 15:30.813
Dude, awesome.
I think I broke mine!

15:30.847 --> 15:33.015
- Oh, bummer.
- So, like, you...

15:33.049 --> 15:34.900
your family
owns all this stuff?

15:34.951 --> 15:36.452
Well, no, not everything.

15:36.486 --> 15:39.221
We own that building,

15:39.255 --> 15:42.307
that one, that house,
that round thing,

15:42.359 --> 15:43.942
that one.

15:43.993 --> 15:45.527
We don't own that.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.662
Oh, no, actually,
we do own that.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.415
What else does your family own?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.134
Well, um, have you heard
of Scotland?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.402
As I was saying,

15:53.436 --> 15:55.537
we've really made
this music program work

15:55.571 --> 15:57.339
in Indiana, and we think,

15:57.374 --> 16:00.175
with your help,
we could turn this

16:00.209 --> 16:01.843
into a wide-reaching
international program.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.112
Oh, you know what I want?

16:03.146 --> 16:04.780
Ice cream. Do you guys
have that here, ice cream?

16:04.814 --> 16:06.165
Oh, it's so good.
You have to get it.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.367
It's, like, scoops,
and it comes on a cone.

16:08.418 --> 16:09.585
- Yeah.
- Do you have that here?

16:09.619 --> 16:10.786
- We have it. Of course we--
- You have it?

16:10.804 --> 16:11.837
Where do you think you are,
the moon?

16:12.939 --> 16:15.524
- That'd be awesome if we were.
- Yeah.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.759
Can we get some?
Could we...

16:17.777 --> 16:20.362
do--could we have some?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.363
Could we?

16:21.398 --> 16:23.399
Sure.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.067
Yeah.

16:25.101 --> 16:27.286
- Let's go.
- Just what do I do with this?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.571
Just throw it there.
Roger will pick it up.

16:29.605 --> 16:31.273
Oh.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.625
"So I long for a day

16:33.660 --> 16:35.610
"when women in government
will simply be seen

16:35.628 --> 16:38.080
"as people in government,
but until then,

16:38.114 --> 16:40.632
"I will work to make Pawnee,
my wonderful hometown,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.050
as good as it can be."

16:42.085 --> 16:43.218
What do you think?

16:43.253 --> 16:45.487
I think you should lose
the first line

16:45.522 --> 16:47.723
and the last line
and all of the other lines,

16:47.757 --> 16:50.142
and instead,
just walk up to the mic

16:50.176 --> 16:53.145
and meow really loudly
for eight minutes.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.597
Okay, this trip is amazing,

16:55.631 --> 16:57.599
but I miss Pawnee, you know?

16:57.633 --> 16:59.134
I want to know
what's happening there.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.438
One little news blast
wouldn't hurt.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.473
Welcome
to <i>The Final Word With Perd.</i>

17:05.492 --> 17:07.342
Ms. Pinewood,
there is a thing you are doing,

17:07.377 --> 17:09.778
and that thing is
you are leading a recall vote

17:09.811 --> 17:12.580
against Councilwoman Knope,
and you say you have

17:12.615 --> 17:14.665
new, shocking allegations
about her.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.452
What? What now?

17:16.486 --> 17:18.170
Perd, I take no pleasure
in reporting this,

17:18.204 --> 17:19.755
but it must come to light.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.340
We are here,
trying to make Pawnee better,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.460
and where is Leslie Knope?

17:24.493 --> 17:28.497
She's gallivanting around Europe
like some kind of European.

17:28.531 --> 17:30.299
How--how did they get
that picture so...

17:30.333 --> 17:31.300
Facebook.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.434
- But I just put--
- Facebook.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.520
- But isn't it a--
- Facebook.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.189
Apparently, she can't be
bothered to stay here in Pawnee,

17:37.223 --> 17:40.142
not when there's Europe
to gallivant around in.

17:40.176 --> 17:41.143
Well, we conducted

17:41.177 --> 17:43.512
a Perd poll
and asked this question:

17:49.018 --> 17:51.820
48% said she should
not be in Europe,

17:51.854 --> 17:53.639
17% say it's okay,

17:53.673 --> 17:54.973
and 35% said

17:55.008 --> 17:57.859
they were confused by the way
the question was posed.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.694
Oh, my God.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.742
You're leaving tonight?

18:02.862 --> 18:04.111
I can't believe there's even a flight?

18:04.231 --> 18:05.670
Well, not to Indiana,

18:05.790 --> 18:07.124
but there's a 9:00 red-eye
to Lisbon,

18:07.158 --> 18:08.726
and then I can catch
the 4:30 A.M.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.209
back to Edinburgh,
connect through Houston,

18:11.329 --> 18:13.089
head on up to Cincinnati
and then rent a car,

18:13.178 --> 18:13.885
drive around 90,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.326
and I'll be home
two hours earlier

18:15.336 --> 18:18.438
than if I flew home as planned.
Easy breezy!

18:18.472 --> 18:19.706
Leslie, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

18:19.740 --> 18:22.425
but I do not think you should
leave Europe right now.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.028
You flew all this way.
Have some perspective.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.363
You have some perspective!

18:27.414 --> 18:29.045
I'm sorry.

18:29.165 --> 18:30.784
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm stressed.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.152
Okay, I need to calm down.

18:32.186 --> 18:34.103
Let's go walk
past Colin Firth's house again.

18:34.105 --> 18:36.156
Ugh, who is that?

18:36.190 --> 18:38.508
Hold up.
My dad said that?

18:38.559 --> 18:39.526
Yeah, Jean-Ralphio.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.528
He told me
that I had screwed you

18:42.546 --> 18:43.913
- out of my business...
- What?

18:43.964 --> 18:45.265
So he was gonna screw me back.

18:45.299 --> 18:47.267
Any idea why he'd believe
such a thing?

18:47.301 --> 18:49.068
That is so weird.

18:49.102 --> 18:51.371
That is so--
oh, you know what?

18:51.405 --> 18:54.057
Honestly, now that I'm thinking
about it, this may be it.

18:54.108 --> 18:56.609
I actually told him
that Rent-A-Swag was my idea

18:56.644 --> 18:59.078
and that you had
stole it from me.

18:59.112 --> 19:00.046
Why would you say that?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.848
Because my dad
is always riding me

19:01.882 --> 19:03.266
for never having a job,

19:03.300 --> 19:04.851
and I just didn't want to show
that I blew it again.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.987
Oh...and I don't know
if this is relevant...

19:08.021 --> 19:09.122
- Hmm.
- But I told him

19:09.156 --> 19:10.507
that you made me sign up

19:10.558 --> 19:12.692
for a bunch of credit cards
and then max them out

19:12.726 --> 19:15.361
by buying illegal
white jaguar fur coats.

19:15.395 --> 19:16.963
That's probably
not relevant, though.

19:16.997 --> 19:17.914
It's probably not relevant,
though.

19:17.965 --> 19:18.965
- I don't know--
- I guess--

19:18.999 --> 19:21.868
All this lying about me
stops now!

19:21.902 --> 19:23.636
- Hmm.
- This is my life.

19:23.671 --> 19:25.839
Please, one of you
has to tell him the truth.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.806
- Not it!
- Not it!

19:26.841 --> 19:28.942
Ooh, you got me!
Whoa ho!

19:28.976 --> 19:30.026
Uh-oh, uh-oh!

19:30.060 --> 19:32.245
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

19:32.279 --> 19:34.080
Okay, fine.
You know what?

19:34.098 --> 19:35.698
I'm gonna do the unthinkable.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.150
I'm gonna have a short,

19:37.184 --> 19:39.452
honest conversation
with my father.

19:39.486 --> 19:40.954
Thank you.

19:48.045 --> 19:50.013
Oh, that's
a big cheering section.

19:50.047 --> 19:52.482
Okay, that's Khongordzol,
from Mongolia.

19:52.516 --> 19:55.785
She grew up in a hut that was
entirely made of ice and mud,

19:55.836 --> 19:58.288
then she became their mayor,
then their police chief

19:58.339 --> 20:00.106
and their best
Wolverine Wrangler.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.358
I love her.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.245
Oh, hi.
You must be Leslie Knope.

20:05.279 --> 20:06.846
I'm Ulee Danssen.
I'm one of the honorees.

20:06.881 --> 20:09.232
Wow, look at your face.

20:09.266 --> 20:10.733
What?

20:10.784 --> 20:13.286
- It's just so symmetrical.
- Oh, thanks!

20:13.320 --> 20:14.837
You know, we all have that
in Denmark.

20:14.889 --> 20:16.439
Oh, you're from Denmark,
of course.

20:16.473 --> 20:17.774
Wow, what part of Denmark
are you from?

20:17.808 --> 20:19.359
I'm from Silkeborg.
You know.

20:19.393 --> 20:21.494
It's not one of the most
perfect places in the world,

20:21.512 --> 20:24.063
but I love it, and it loves me.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.815
And look
what they've done for me.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.984
- They made a statue of you!
- Yes.

20:28.035 --> 20:30.336
Wow.
Is that goat cheese?

20:30.371 --> 20:31.554
Good cheese eye, Leslie.

20:31.589 --> 20:32.838
It is made out of goat cheese.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.074
We have a lot of it,
and after tonight's event,

20:35.109 --> 20:37.794
they're going to consume me
with crackers.

20:37.828 --> 20:41.681
They just love me.
What about your town?

20:41.715 --> 20:43.449
Well, Pawnee, Indiana,

20:43.484 --> 20:45.234
is a wonderful town,

20:45.286 --> 20:46.836
and I love it,
but they hate me.

20:46.887 --> 20:48.388
And they're trying
to kick me out of office.

20:48.422 --> 20:51.658
One time, they made a pinata
of my face,

20:51.692 --> 20:53.053
and then everybody
in the town came

20:53.060 --> 20:54.711
and took turns hitting it
with a stick,

20:54.762 --> 20:56.629
and they filled it
with broccoli,

20:56.647 --> 20:58.064
just to add insult to injury...

20:58.098 --> 20:59.816
but politics...

20:59.850 --> 21:01.034
you know what I mean, right?

21:01.068 --> 21:03.286
I don't, no.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.191
So you're from Mongolia?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.878
Will you take me with you
when you go back there?

21:12.880 --> 21:13.846
I love you.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.064
Hmm.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.734
Did you understand that?

21:17.785 --> 21:19.535
Did you bring any wolverines?

21:22.923 --> 21:24.474
Say it again.
Say it again.

21:24.508 --> 21:26.142
Alu-min-ium.

21:26.193 --> 21:27.527
Okay, okay.

21:27.561 --> 21:28.962
You say it. You say it.
You say it.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.129
It's "alumilum."

21:30.163 --> 21:31.464
- "Alumilum"?
- Okay.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.149
- Alumilum!
- Uh, Eddie...

21:33.183 --> 21:35.318
if you'd like me to talk more
about the program,

21:35.352 --> 21:37.286
- I would be happy to...
- Mm-hmm.

21:37.321 --> 21:39.956
But my wife is receiving
an award in just a few minutes,

21:40.007 --> 21:40.940
and I really need
to get over there.

21:40.975 --> 21:41.941
Yes, of course.

21:41.976 --> 21:44.811
The thing is,

21:44.845 --> 21:46.829
I don't know what I'm doing.

21:46.864 --> 21:48.131
- Me neither.
- I'm sorry?

21:48.165 --> 21:50.633
My family has
a huge amount of money.

21:50.668 --> 21:54.320
We live in a castle
that has 1,000 acres of land.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.673
Our hedge maze is so vast,

21:56.707 --> 21:59.125
once, I got lost in there
for two days.

21:59.159 --> 22:00.292
What?
That's awesome.

22:00.310 --> 22:01.594
It was awesome.

22:01.628 --> 22:03.646
There was a statue
of a lion inside,

22:03.697 --> 22:05.331
and I found a yo-yo.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.582
Well, do you--
do you have it here?

22:06.633 --> 22:08.501
- Guys--
- The point is,

22:08.535 --> 22:11.387
I started this foundation
in order to do something good

22:11.438 --> 22:12.739
with our money,

22:12.773 --> 22:15.324
and I've heard hundreds
of charity pitches,

22:15.359 --> 22:19.429
and I honestly don't know
whether they're good or bad.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.116
If I may, ours...
is great.

22:23.150 --> 22:25.084
Brilliant!
I'm in.

22:25.119 --> 22:27.286
What?
Are you serious?

22:27.320 --> 22:29.839
Yeah.
I like you, I like music.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.224
On one condition:

22:31.258 --> 22:33.860
I want you to stay here
in London with me

22:33.894 --> 22:36.279
for no more than three months,

22:36.330 --> 22:38.214
to help me get it up
and running

22:38.265 --> 22:40.049
and tell me what to do.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.768
Oh, well,
that actually may be tough.

22:41.802 --> 22:43.069
I mean,
my wife is in the middle

22:43.103 --> 22:44.337
of this recall fight,
and I really need to--

22:44.371 --> 22:47.874
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, I meant Andy.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.844
I want Andy to stay.

22:51.862 --> 22:55.614
Is that a goose
that just flew by the window?

22:55.632 --> 22:58.885
Oh, it's a plastic bag.
Did you see that?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.087
Wait, did I interrupt?

23:01.121 --> 23:02.105
What are you guys
talking about?

23:02.156 --> 23:03.406
Let's see if it was a goose.

23:03.457 --> 23:06.242
I think it could have been,
honest to God.

23:06.293 --> 23:08.160
Silkeborg is wonderful,

23:08.178 --> 23:10.629
and I am very supported
and loved.

23:10.647 --> 23:12.231
Once, on my birthday, the town

23:12.265 --> 23:14.667
trained a reindeer
to do a dance for me.

23:14.701 --> 23:18.838
It was beautiful,
and the reindeer was delicious.

23:21.241 --> 23:22.875
- Hey.
- Hey!

23:22.910 --> 23:24.443
How was your meeting?

23:24.461 --> 23:27.130
Good.
I'll fill you in later.

23:27.181 --> 23:28.214
Are you ready for your speech?

23:28.248 --> 23:30.547
Uh...yeah.
Yeah.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.637
Thank you, Ulee.

23:31.757 --> 23:36.089
It is so inspiring to hear
stories of powerful women

23:36.123 --> 23:38.808
who are held in high esteem
by their hometowns.

23:38.859 --> 23:41.360
Now, from the hometown
of Pawnee, Indiana,

23:41.378 --> 23:43.546
in the United States,

23:43.597 --> 23:44.630
Leslie Knope.

23:51.572 --> 23:53.956
First let me say,

23:54.007 --> 23:56.375
it is a true honor to be here
among these amazing women.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.328
You all inspire me
with your accomplishments

23:59.363 --> 24:01.948
and the things you have done
for your hometowns

24:01.982 --> 24:04.183
and the things your hometowns
have done for you.

24:04.201 --> 24:07.286
I mean, they're just truly...

24:09.306 --> 24:11.924
You know, I've been a public
servant for a long time.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.527
And you know
how I spend my days?

24:14.561 --> 24:16.896
Cleaning slime out of rivers

24:16.930 --> 24:20.166
and removing slugs
from people's front yards.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.552
And I love my town,
but you know how they repay me?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.303
By hating me.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.589
They hate me.
They want to recall me.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.108
I wish I could move
to Silkeborg

24:29.143 --> 24:30.977
and dance with a reindeer.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.178
You're always welcome
in Silkeborg!

24:32.196 --> 24:35.347
Olga, let's start
a statue of Leslie.

24:35.365 --> 24:37.116
See? They like me
in Silkeborg

24:37.151 --> 24:39.485
more than my own hometown,
and I've never even been there.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.955
I love Pawnee,
but sometimes it sucks.

24:42.990 --> 24:44.991
The people can be very mean
and ungrateful,

24:45.025 --> 24:46.125
and they cling

24:46.160 --> 24:49.996
to their fried dough
and their big sodas,

24:50.030 --> 24:52.798
and then they get mad at me
when their pants don't fit.

24:52.833 --> 24:54.366
You know, I'm sick of it.

24:54.384 --> 24:58.171
Pawnee is filled
with a bunch of pee-pee-heads.

24:59.423 --> 25:00.756
Thank you very much
for this amazing award.

25:00.807 --> 25:01.757
I'm sorry
I said "pee-pee-heads."

25:02.809 --> 25:06.012
Whoo!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.730
That's my boss!

25:09.866 --> 25:12.232
That speech was a little rough,
don't you think?

25:12.352 --> 25:14.313
Whatever, it's how I feel.

25:14.553 --> 25:16.221
Stupid, ungrateful town.

25:16.341 --> 25:17.872
Plus, you said it yourself:

25:17.907 --> 25:19.290
We're 4,000 miles away.

25:22.461 --> 25:24.779
- Hello.
- Leslie, it's Jerry.

25:24.830 --> 25:26.030
Jerry who?

25:26.064 --> 25:27.198
Gergich.

25:27.216 --> 25:28.383
Jer--oh, Jerry.

25:28.417 --> 25:29.918
Jerry, why are you calling me?

25:29.952 --> 25:31.803
I don't want to waste
my international minutes.

25:31.837 --> 25:35.356
Leslie, your speech
was webcast, here in Pawnee.

25:35.391 --> 25:36.741
Everyone saw it.

25:36.759 --> 25:38.509
What do you mean, "everyone"?

25:38.544 --> 25:40.678
I had organized
a big viewing party,

25:40.712 --> 25:41.746
you know, to support you,

25:41.780 --> 25:43.314
and, well,
now that Kathryn Pinewood lady,

25:43.332 --> 25:44.549
she's already pounced.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.602
She's calling it the...
"Pee-pee-head" speech.

25:47.636 --> 25:49.487
- Bloody hell, Jerry!
- So how's Lond--

25:50.990 --> 25:53.191
I just never thought
that I would get

25:53.225 --> 25:54.726
to make this announcement.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.927
It's a very special day.

25:56.946 --> 25:57.996
Okay.

25:58.030 --> 26:00.048
Hi, Donna.

26:00.082 --> 26:01.099
So...

26:01.133 --> 26:02.100
You're pregnant.

26:02.134 --> 26:04.068
Oh, man, Tom told you.

26:04.103 --> 26:05.036
Nope.

26:05.070 --> 26:06.454
You're drinking decaf coffee,

26:06.505 --> 26:08.185
which you usually only do
in the afternoon,

26:08.207 --> 26:09.674
you're wearing
an empire-waist dress

26:09.708 --> 26:12.377
and loose shoes 'cause your feet
are already swelling.

26:12.411 --> 26:14.412
I'd put you at nine,
maybe ten weeks.

26:14.446 --> 26:15.847
My goodness, you're observant.

26:15.881 --> 26:17.682
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

26:17.716 --> 26:21.502
Hmm. When did you make
the switch to boxer briefs?

26:21.537 --> 26:23.921
Yesterday.

26:23.955 --> 26:26.691
Okay, please stop
looking at him.

26:26.725 --> 26:29.060
Why are we here?

26:29.094 --> 26:31.212
Just thought you needed
some fresh air,

26:31.246 --> 26:33.214
even if that air is filled
with the foul stench

26:33.265 --> 26:35.500
of European socialism.

26:35.534 --> 26:37.869
You know, I know
I am supposed to feel bad

26:37.903 --> 26:40.805
about what I said,
but I do not.

26:40.839 --> 26:42.940
Pawnee has really been
pissing me off lately.

26:42.975 --> 26:45.410
Leslie, for God's sake,
you're the adult here.

26:45.444 --> 26:47.378
When your kid screams
"I hate you,"

26:47.412 --> 26:50.181
you don't sink to his level
and yell "I hate you" back.

26:50.215 --> 26:51.816
You have to be the grown-up.

26:51.850 --> 26:53.284
You're right.
I know.

26:53.318 --> 26:54.869
I have to be the grown-up.

26:54.903 --> 26:57.855
But it's so hard! Ron!

26:57.890 --> 26:59.324
God!

26:59.358 --> 27:01.275
And nobody ever thanks you.

27:01.327 --> 27:02.827
You choose a thankless job,

27:02.845 --> 27:04.846
you can't be upset
when nobody thanks you.

27:04.897 --> 27:07.231
And by the way,
April thanked you.

27:07.265 --> 27:09.233
She nominated you
for this award.

27:09.267 --> 27:10.535
Well, April does that
all the time.

27:10.569 --> 27:13.388
She nominated Ann for Motocross
Driver of the Year award

27:13.439 --> 27:15.139
just so she could
get a rejection letter.

27:15.173 --> 27:16.858
April respects you,

27:16.909 --> 27:19.711
and so do many others.

27:19.745 --> 27:21.829
Don't start chasing applause
and acclaim.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.315
That way lies madness.

27:26.051 --> 27:27.985
Oh, I almost forgot.

27:28.019 --> 27:30.988
I finally got you
a proper wedding gift,

27:31.006 --> 27:32.807
part one of many.

27:32.841 --> 27:34.525
A train ticket?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.911
You think I want
to extend my stay

27:36.945 --> 27:38.579
on this godforsaken continent?

27:38.614 --> 27:40.048
Yes, you do.

27:40.082 --> 27:42.266
If you follow that itinerary
to the letter,

27:42.301 --> 27:45.453
I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

27:45.487 --> 27:47.705
Well, I would offer
to buy you a drink,

27:47.740 --> 27:49.140
but where the hell
would that even happen?

27:49.174 --> 27:50.992
This is London, Ron.

27:51.026 --> 27:53.728
There's a pub over there,
there's a pub over there,

27:53.779 --> 27:54.979
there's a pub
between those two butcher shops.

27:54.997 --> 27:56.381
Let's go to that one,

27:56.415 --> 27:59.967
but we'll be stopping in
those two butcher shops first.

28:00.002 --> 28:01.436
Hey, Jerry.

28:01.470 --> 28:03.354
I didn't know
you were working today.

28:03.388 --> 28:05.268
Yeah, Ron asked me
to come in while he's away.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.608
Of course, I had to cancel
my cardiologist appoint--

28:07.643 --> 28:09.093
That's great.

28:09.127 --> 28:10.762
Now, here's a piece of
information that <i>is</i> interesting.

28:10.796 --> 28:13.448
Ann is pregnant,
and it's my baby.

28:13.499 --> 28:15.450
Oh, my God,
that's wonderful news!

28:15.501 --> 28:17.218
Oh, there's so much
in front of you.

28:17.252 --> 28:18.669
I mean,
soon you're gonna start showing,

28:18.687 --> 28:20.471
and then your clothes
will feel tight, and then,

28:20.505 --> 28:24.492
oh, people are gonna start
rubbing your tummy all the time!

28:24.526 --> 28:26.244
That sounds terrible.

28:26.278 --> 28:28.229
Well, Gayle,
she got really queasy,

28:28.263 --> 28:30.098
and I gained a lot
of sympathy weight.

28:30.149 --> 28:32.817
Yeah. You know, actually,
before my kids,

28:32.851 --> 28:34.102
I looked a lot like you, Chris.

28:34.136 --> 28:36.454
I'm very sad.
Please stop talking.

28:36.488 --> 28:38.423
And, of course,
pretty soon, Ann,

28:38.457 --> 28:40.308
your milk is gonna come in.

28:40.359 --> 28:42.743
- Ohh.
- That is exciting.

28:42.778 --> 28:43.861
Mmm.

28:47.433 --> 28:49.383
Yep, and it happens sooner
than you'd think.

28:49.435 --> 28:50.634
The babies can sense it.

28:50.652 --> 28:51.936
You would be shocked,

28:51.970 --> 28:54.372
'cause they are rooting around
for that nipple.

28:54.406 --> 28:56.090
Mm, mm.
Gimme, gimme. Mm, mm, mm.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.476
I want milk!
Mm, mm, mm, mm. Ohh.

28:58.510 --> 29:00.194
Life is a miracle.

29:00.229 --> 29:02.163
Mm, mm, mm.

29:02.197 --> 29:04.749
So it's kind of awesome
that the Lord Fancyface Guy

29:04.783 --> 29:06.100
wants you to stay.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.185
Yeah, I guess.

29:07.219 --> 29:09.053
I mean, I can't do it,
obviously.

29:09.071 --> 29:10.605
Why?

29:10.656 --> 29:12.623
I don't even know
what I would be doing.

29:12.657 --> 29:13.841
I mean, besides,
this is England.

29:13.876 --> 29:16.627
Everything is so weird.
It's all different.

29:16.661 --> 29:19.130
Yeah, like how they drive
on the other side of the road.

29:19.164 --> 29:20.181
Do they?

29:20.215 --> 29:22.200
I'll be damned.

29:22.234 --> 29:23.985
Yeah, like that.

29:24.036 --> 29:26.037
That's what I'm--
exactly what I'm talking about.

29:26.071 --> 29:27.238
Or like the Piccadilly Circus
we went to?

29:27.256 --> 29:28.539
Not even a circus.

29:28.573 --> 29:31.142
There's no elephants,
there was no cotton candy,

29:31.176 --> 29:33.261
there's no clowns.

29:33.312 --> 29:34.512
One bearded lady.

29:34.546 --> 29:36.230
She got all rude
when I marveled at her.

29:36.265 --> 29:38.783
Do you like
the Lord Fancyface Guy?

29:38.817 --> 29:39.951
Oh, he's awesome.

29:39.985 --> 29:41.202
He's everything
you would want in a boss.

29:41.253 --> 29:44.255
I mean, remote control
helicopters, talks funny.

29:44.289 --> 29:45.540
Total package.

29:45.591 --> 29:47.124
I think you should do it.

29:47.142 --> 29:49.293
When are you gonna have
another opportunity like this?

29:49.311 --> 29:50.294
- I mean--
- And, plus,

29:50.312 --> 29:51.795
we can deal
with the distance, okay?

29:51.813 --> 29:54.682
Remember, I was
in Washington last year.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.483
He said he wanted me
to head up the company.

29:56.487 --> 29:58.802
I have no idea
how to run a nonprofit.

29:58.820 --> 30:00.304
Hey.

30:00.322 --> 30:01.472
You shined shoes

30:01.490 --> 30:04.859
for over two years
and never made a profit.

30:05.861 --> 30:08.279
Come on, you can hack this.

30:08.313 --> 30:11.148
I believe in you.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.084
But to replace you,
I am going to have to build

30:13.118 --> 30:15.953
a scarecrow replica of you
and take it to the movies.

30:15.987 --> 30:18.956
Seems like
the only logical solution.

30:25.222 --> 30:27.489
My point is, Ethel, that

30:28.244 --> 30:29.136
Ann's pregnant.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.170
And I'm the baby daddy!

30:31.290 --> 30:32.874
How wonderful for you.

30:32.994 --> 30:34.712
You don't seem
very excited for us.

30:34.746 --> 30:36.430
I barely know you,

30:36.464 --> 30:38.102
and I don't have

30:38.222 --> 30:41.952
to talk to you
unless it's about work.

30:41.987 --> 30:43.828
Man, I thought
this would be more satisfying.

30:43.838 --> 30:45.389
I agree.

30:45.423 --> 30:47.441
Wait a minute, what time is it?

30:47.475 --> 30:49.793
Has she landed yet?

30:49.828 --> 30:51.948
Oh, I'm so happy for you guys!

30:52.068 --> 30:55.170
Ohh, this is the greatest day
in the history of days.

30:55.204 --> 30:56.372
This day,
a thousand years from now,

30:56.406 --> 30:57.906
will be celebrated
as the beginning

30:57.941 --> 30:59.908
of a new and better human race.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.210
I am so happy for you,
I'm never letting you go.

31:01.244 --> 31:02.454
I am not gonna let you go.

31:02.574 --> 31:03.656
Oh, oh, oh, eventually,

31:03.776 --> 31:05.005
she's going to have to go
back to work.

31:05.070 --> 31:06.287
Are you sure
you should be working?

31:06.321 --> 31:08.556
I mean, you should be resting
and getting fluids and--

31:08.590 --> 31:10.591
and cold compresses
and greasy foods.

31:10.642 --> 31:11.893
That's for a hangover.

31:11.944 --> 31:12.865
Right, yeah, of course.

31:12.895 --> 31:13.935
I'm so goofed-up
right now.

31:13.946 --> 31:14.996
I'm so jet-lagged.

31:15.030 --> 31:16.330
I took a sleeping pill
on the plane,

31:16.381 --> 31:17.665
and then I changed my mind,

31:17.716 --> 31:19.183
so I took this thing
called "Zapvigil,"

31:19.218 --> 31:20.601
which, apparently, is what

31:20.652 --> 31:22.403
Israeli fighter pilots
use to stay awake.

31:22.437 --> 31:25.590
So right now, it looks like
I'm talking to a giant crab.

31:25.624 --> 31:26.874
Stay away from me, crab!

31:26.925 --> 31:28.159
I'm just kidding.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.293
I know it's Ann.

31:29.328 --> 31:31.062
We are so glad you're back.

31:31.096 --> 31:33.030
We talked to, like, 50 people,
and, frankly,

31:33.064 --> 31:34.031
not one of them gave us

31:34.065 --> 31:35.249
the reaction
that we were hoping for.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.434
And your reaction,

31:36.468 --> 31:38.102
from someone we love so much,

31:38.136 --> 31:40.021
I mean, it just makes up
for all the other ones.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.739
- Ohh.
- Anyway, welcome home!

31:41.757 --> 31:43.141
Don't pinch me!

31:43.175 --> 31:45.610
Thank you all for coming,
and let me just say

31:45.644 --> 31:48.362
how truly, deeply trill it is

31:48.397 --> 31:51.949
to be standing in this dope-ass
conference room,

31:51.984 --> 31:52.984
addressing a group of people
in a business meeting.

31:53.018 --> 31:54.318
It's really a dream come true.

31:54.353 --> 31:57.588
Right now, I want to turn
the floor over to Jean-Ralphio,

31:57.623 --> 31:59.807
who has something to say.

32:03.145 --> 32:05.997
Tom, lawyer guy...

32:06.031 --> 32:07.715
daddy...

32:07.766 --> 32:09.684
Tom did not screw me
out of the company.

32:09.718 --> 32:11.736
He gave me every opportunity
to jump in

32:11.770 --> 32:14.155
at the ground floor,
and I said no,

32:14.206 --> 32:16.040
not because I thought
it was a bad idea,

32:16.074 --> 32:19.110
but because--
and this is very important--

32:19.144 --> 32:22.213
I really didn't care
about what was happening.

32:22.247 --> 32:24.682
So why, exactly, did you lie

32:24.716 --> 32:26.234
when I asked you
what had happened?

32:26.268 --> 32:29.320
Daddy-D! Daddy, come on,
I lie to you all the time!

32:29.354 --> 32:31.088
All those math camps
I said I went to?

32:31.122 --> 32:33.641
I don't even know
what a math camp is!

32:33.675 --> 32:36.194
So all those postcards
that you sent me,

32:36.228 --> 32:38.412
all those trophies
that you'd won...

32:38.447 --> 32:42.800
♪ Trophies I bought

32:43.969 --> 32:45.987
I also have something to say.

32:46.038 --> 32:48.839
I have done nothing wrong,

32:48.874 --> 32:51.108
ever, in my life.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.311
I know this...

32:53.345 --> 32:54.662
and I love you.

32:54.696 --> 32:56.080
I love you too, daddy.

32:56.114 --> 32:58.049
Money, please!

32:58.083 --> 32:59.767
My money.

32:59.801 --> 33:03.153
Dr. Saperstein,
your son is my best friend.

33:03.171 --> 33:04.571
- Yeah.
- He's like a brother to me.

33:04.590 --> 33:06.090
But he's a disaster,

33:06.124 --> 33:08.726
and your daughter
seriously needs to be locked up

33:08.760 --> 33:10.228
in some sort of insane asylum.

33:10.262 --> 33:11.746
- Mm.
- On an island...

33:11.780 --> 33:13.030
- Ooh.
- In space.

33:13.064 --> 33:14.532
♪ Hold on

33:14.566 --> 33:18.452
These two have been
huge disappointments to me.

33:18.487 --> 33:20.438
Come on, you love us.

33:20.472 --> 33:23.157
Tell me you love us,
and then admit this guy

33:23.208 --> 33:24.492
looks like Beaker
from the Muppets.

33:24.543 --> 33:26.543
Dad!

33:26.561 --> 33:28.145
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

33:28.180 --> 33:30.064
But seriously,
what are we doing here, though?

33:30.098 --> 33:31.148
- What are we doing here, dad?
- Like, what is this?

33:31.166 --> 33:32.483
- Why are we here?
- So...

33:32.501 --> 33:34.669
So...

33:34.720 --> 33:35.886
now you know the truth.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.054
Will you back off?

33:37.088 --> 33:38.656
No, I will not stop.

33:38.690 --> 33:41.826
Yes, this all started
as vengeance for my children,

33:41.860 --> 33:44.295
but the company
is making money now.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.273
Why would I back off
just 'cause these nincompoops

33:46.298 --> 33:47.982
lie to me all the time?

33:48.033 --> 33:50.201
No, I'm not gonna back off.

33:50.235 --> 33:53.154
I'm gonna continue,
and I'm gonna crush you!

33:53.188 --> 33:55.106
All right, you two,

33:55.140 --> 33:56.580
are you in for dinner
tomorrow night?

33:56.608 --> 33:58.276
- Yes!
- Yes, daddy.

33:58.310 --> 33:59.293
Huh?
Blow me a kiss.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.378
Mwah!

34:00.412 --> 34:01.462
- Mwah.
- Caught it.

34:01.513 --> 34:02.463
I love you, daddy!

34:02.497 --> 34:03.681
- Me too.
- I love you, daddy!

34:03.715 --> 34:06.317
Hey, are you gonna be okay
with Andy gone?

34:06.351 --> 34:07.952
Yeah, we'll be fine.

34:07.986 --> 34:10.087
Are you gonna be okay
with Ben still here?

34:10.121 --> 34:11.138
- April...
- What?

34:11.172 --> 34:13.274
I don't trust him.
I never have.

34:13.308 --> 34:15.775
- He's after your money.
- Hey, Gretel!

34:15.811 --> 34:18.362
Hello, it's me,
City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.965
And me, Odie the dog,
Garfield's enemy.

34:20.998 --> 34:23.768
Now, we have some great news:
we were in London,

34:23.802 --> 34:26.437
and we met a wonderful woman
from Mongolia.

34:26.471 --> 34:27.751
Yeah, her name was Khongordzol,

34:27.772 --> 34:29.790
and I love her more
than anything in the world.

34:29.824 --> 34:32.927
Khongordzol and...
Odie, here, were emailing,

34:32.978 --> 34:35.730
and she recommended
a very humane way

34:35.781 --> 34:37.147
to get rid of slugs.

34:37.165 --> 34:39.500
You sprinkle coffee grounds
on the affected area,

34:39.551 --> 34:42.520
and it drives the slugs away.
Isn't that great?

34:42.554 --> 34:44.355
I didn't want
<i>all</i> the slugs gone.

34:44.389 --> 34:45.889
I wanted most of them gone!

34:45.924 --> 34:48.492
Sorry.
Well, we'll put one slug back.

34:48.527 --> 34:50.828
Either way,
your problem is solved.

34:50.862 --> 34:52.630
Oh, my God,
that lady is the worst.

34:52.664 --> 34:54.715
She didn't even say thank you.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.500
That's not why
we do this, April.

34:56.518 --> 34:58.359
We do it because it's good
and it helps people,

34:58.387 --> 34:59.804
not to get the applause.

34:59.838 --> 35:01.322
Yeah, but doesn't that
bum you out?

35:01.356 --> 35:03.491
Well, sure, it would be nice
if just one person

35:03.525 --> 35:06.810
appreciated my work, at all.

35:06.828 --> 35:08.245
But that's the job--

35:08.280 --> 35:11.982
wiping slime
and shoveling slugs.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.985
All right.
On to the next complaint.

35:29.184 --> 35:32.853
Where the hell
are you sending me, Knope?

35:36.556 --> 35:37.782
Morning, cutie.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.123
Morning, Jessica.

35:39.157 --> 35:39.825
Whoa.

35:39.945 --> 35:42.079
These were a gift
from your British friend,

35:42.199 --> 35:43.503
Lord Edgar Covington.

35:43.615 --> 35:45.372
He was very impressed
with you two.

35:45.492 --> 35:47.577
He sounded rich on the phone.

35:47.611 --> 35:50.763
I think he was calling me
from a helicopter.

35:50.798 --> 35:52.115
Could be.
He owns two.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.318
So Andy's gonna stay there
for three months.

35:55.352 --> 35:56.619
I hope he's okay.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.887
He sent me an email
this morning.

35:57.921 --> 35:59.347
I guess he got
on the wrong train

35:59.467 --> 36:01.741
on the way to work
and got lost.

36:01.792 --> 36:04.127
Yeah, this isn't right.

36:04.161 --> 36:07.096
None of this looks familiar.

36:08.982 --> 36:11.284
Eddie?

36:11.335 --> 36:13.086
Uh-oh, Spaghettios.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.269
Oh, don't worry,
I'm sure he'll adjust.

36:15.389 --> 36:17.691
No, I named that dog
Spaghettios,

36:17.742 --> 36:19.309
and he just pooped
in your briefcase.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.244
Oh, my.
Okay.

36:21.278 --> 36:22.879
Come on, Sugarbutt!

36:22.913 --> 36:24.397
Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?

36:24.432 --> 36:26.282
That's you!
Come on.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.184
We got a board meeting,
Sugarbutt.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.671
Wildly inappropriate.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.573
Do you think there's any
chance your dad will give up?

36:33.607 --> 36:34.574
I doubt it.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.126
He never gives up on anything,

36:36.160 --> 36:37.260
except for my mom.

36:37.294 --> 36:40.096
When she turned 30,
he was like, "Get out!"

36:40.114 --> 36:42.816
Maybe I should just
throw in the towel.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.501
Your dad'll destroy me.
I'll be left with nothing.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.503
Thought I was a better-looking
version of Zuckerberg.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.172
Turns out I'm the better-looking
version of the Winklevoss twins.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.274
First of all,
unbelievable analogy.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.776
Second of all, what are you
talking about, man?

36:52.810 --> 36:55.128
You're Tommy Haverford!
You're an idea man.

36:55.162 --> 36:56.613
When Babyface was your age,

36:56.647 --> 36:58.281
he hadn't even signed
Toni Braxton yet,

36:58.315 --> 37:00.600
let alone Usher.

37:00.634 --> 37:03.553
You're right.
I mean, I'm basically Babyface.

37:03.571 --> 37:05.238
You're basically Babyface!

37:05.289 --> 37:08.458
Okay, I'm gonna keep going,
and I'm gonna beat your dad.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.176
That's what I'm talking about!

37:10.227 --> 37:12.128
And for me, it's a win-win
either way.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.197
Either my best friend
emerges triumphant,

37:14.231 --> 37:17.550
or my dad beats you, and I get
all that money when he dies.

37:17.585 --> 37:18.518
I'm actually getting dinner
with my dad right now.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.436
- You want to come?
- No!

37:20.454 --> 37:22.672
I mean, this is all

37:22.706 --> 37:24.891
pretty overwhelming, you know?

37:24.925 --> 37:26.776
You know what I just read?

37:26.811 --> 37:30.547
Right now, our baby is the size
of a green olive.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.732
Isn't that wild?

37:32.767 --> 37:33.983
It is.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.236
A green olive.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.921
A little high in sodium.

37:37.955 --> 37:39.672
I would have preferred
a chickpea or a cherry tomato.

37:39.723 --> 37:42.091
- Our baby's not a salad.
- Yes, right.

37:42.109 --> 37:44.427
It's just weird, you know?

37:44.462 --> 37:48.198
I mean, for so long,
this little green olive

37:48.232 --> 37:49.949
was just our thing,

37:49.984 --> 37:51.885
and now it's everyone's thing.

37:51.919 --> 37:53.836
Every time Jerry looks at me,

37:53.854 --> 37:56.573
he's thinking about...
the milk in my boobs.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.993
It's still just our thing.

38:00.044 --> 38:03.012
It'll always be just our thing.

38:03.046 --> 38:06.282
That's why it's so wonderful
and why we'll love it so much.

38:10.588 --> 38:13.189
You know, Olive's kind of
a cute name, if it's a girl.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.657
I prefer "Chickpea."

38:14.692 --> 38:15.775
Because it's lower in sodium?

38:15.826 --> 38:18.094
- Yes, exactly.
- Okay.

38:20.097 --> 38:22.098
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:22.132 --> 38:23.533
Are you leaving?

38:23.567 --> 38:25.568
Well, I just have to get
a jump start on my next phase.

38:25.603 --> 38:29.906
Let's see, it is
"48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."

38:29.924 --> 38:31.257
Oh, brother.

38:31.292 --> 38:33.676
Okay, well, before you go,
I have something for you.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.528
I feel like you're getting sad

38:35.563 --> 38:37.997
about how stupid
and lame people are,

38:38.032 --> 38:40.800
and that is my job, not yours.

38:40.851 --> 38:44.354
So I'm gonna read
this letter to you, out loud,

38:44.388 --> 38:45.738
but if you hug me afterwards,

38:45.789 --> 38:47.090
I swear to God, I'll scream

38:47.124 --> 38:49.342
and pull my hair out
and maybe punch you in the face.

38:49.376 --> 38:51.261
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.530
Please sit.

38:54.882 --> 38:56.633
"Dear award committee
members..."

38:57.768 --> 39:00.103
Leslie, I didn't even start.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.487
Okay, I'm sorry.

39:01.522 --> 39:02.856
Go ahead.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.157
"Dear award committee members,

39:04.191 --> 39:07.243
"where I live, there are
a lot of apathetic people,

39:07.277 --> 39:09.378
"people who don't care at all
about what they do

39:09.396 --> 39:10.513
"or how they do it.

39:10.547 --> 39:12.182
"They let the world
wash over them

39:12.216 --> 39:14.184
"and barely notice
anyone else is even there.

39:14.218 --> 39:17.153
"Leslie Knope is not
one of these people.

39:17.171 --> 39:21.057
"She cares about everything
and everyone in our town.

39:21.091 --> 39:22.392
"I don't know how she does it.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.444
"People come to her
with the pettiest,

39:24.478 --> 39:25.812
"stupidest problems,

39:25.863 --> 39:28.531
"and she cares--
like, really, actually cares--

39:28.566 --> 39:29.816
"what happens to them.

39:29.850 --> 39:32.468
"And if you're lucky enough
to be her friend,

39:32.502 --> 39:35.555
"your life
gets better every day.

39:35.606 --> 39:37.523
"She spends every waking moment
thinking

39:37.575 --> 39:39.909
"of new ways
to make her friends happy.

39:39.943 --> 39:42.128
"There is something wonderful
about seeing someone

39:42.162 --> 39:43.913
"who has found
her true purpose on earth.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.582
"For some people, I guess
that's being an astronaut

39:46.600 --> 39:48.968
"or a hot dog-eating champion.

39:49.019 --> 39:52.889
"For Leslie, her true purpose
on earth, her true meaning,

39:52.923 --> 39:56.425
"is making
people's lives better.

39:56.443 --> 39:58.528
"That's what I love about her,

39:58.562 --> 40:02.732
"and that's why she deserves
this award.

40:02.766 --> 40:03.900
"Sincerely...

40:03.934 --> 40:05.735
Satan."

40:05.769 --> 40:07.487
You're getting hugged
right now.

40:07.538 --> 40:08.771
No, I told you not to.

40:08.789 --> 40:11.241
- I'm giving you a hug.
- No! Stay away! No!

40:13.221 --> 40:15.761
All my life I've avoided Europe

40:15.881 --> 40:18.423
and its multitudes of terribleness.

40:18.543 --> 40:21.061
But it turns out,
much to my surprise,

40:21.095 --> 40:23.230
there is actually
one place in Europe

40:23.264 --> 40:25.816
that is worth seeing:

40:25.850 --> 40:28.936
these tiny islands
off the coast of Scotland,

40:28.970 --> 40:31.605
where God's chosen elixirs
are distilled,

40:31.656 --> 40:33.790
barreled, and prepared
for consumption.

40:33.825 --> 40:37.778
<i>This</i> is worth the trip.

40:37.829 --> 40:40.030
"Dear Ron,

40:40.064 --> 40:41.999
"you have now
reached the cliffsides

40:42.033 --> 40:43.750
"overlooking the islands.

40:43.785 --> 40:46.920
"As you sit here
and gaze upon the waters,

40:46.955 --> 40:49.122
"please read out loud the poem

40:49.173 --> 40:51.306
"by the great Scotsman
Robert Burns.

40:51.426 --> 40:52.916
Love, Leslie."

40:54.679 --> 40:57.717
"Oh, were my love
yon lilac fair,

40:57.844 --> 41:00.596
"with purple blossoms
to the spring,

41:00.631 --> 41:03.799
"and I,
a bird to shelter there,

41:03.850 --> 41:06.686
"when wearied
on my little wing,

41:06.720 --> 41:09.689
"how I would mourn
when it was torn

41:09.723 --> 41:12.925
"by autumn wild
and winter rude,

41:12.943 --> 41:16.062
"but I would sing
on wanton wing,

41:16.096 --> 41:19.765
when youthful may
its bloom renewed."

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

41:25.872 --> 41:28.958
I don't know what she thought
I'd get out of that.

41:31.295 --> 41:33.746
- Nice to be home.
- It is.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.415
But I mean, I love Pawnee,
I will always love Pawnee,

41:36.449 --> 41:37.833
but London is amazing.

41:37.884 --> 41:40.670
And Silkeborg sounds amazing,

41:40.721 --> 41:42.421
and Mongolia sounds amazing.

41:42.455 --> 41:44.840
Their mayor is a professional
Wolverine Wrangler.

41:44.891 --> 41:46.625
Fine, Mongolia
sounds terrifying,

41:46.643 --> 41:48.344
but the world
is a very big place,

41:48.395 --> 41:50.179
and I've seen
very little of it.

41:50.230 --> 41:53.649
Maybe we should travel more,
expand our horizons.

41:53.684 --> 41:55.851
You know, I've had
the same kinds of thoughts.

41:55.902 --> 41:58.804
We should keep that in mind,
see where it leads us.

41:58.822 --> 42:00.139
Yeah.

42:00.157 --> 42:01.440
Oh, there's one more thing
I want to try.

42:01.474 --> 42:02.441
Mm.

42:02.475 --> 42:03.976
I got you something in London:

42:03.994 --> 42:05.695
a traditional barrister's wig.

42:05.746 --> 42:08.197
- Oh.
- Wear it for me.

42:08.248 --> 42:09.999
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

42:10.033 --> 42:11.984
All right.

42:15.172 --> 42:16.272
What's up?

42:16.306 --> 42:17.957
No, not sexy.

42:17.991 --> 42:18.987
Failed experiment.
Take it off.

42:19.107 --> 42:20.787
- Okay, just--okay.
- Just take it off. No.
