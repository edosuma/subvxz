WEBVTT

00:06.671 --> 00:08.341
Previously on E.R.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.394
It's my case, Kerry.

00:09.495 --> 00:12.204
I'm calling it.
Time of death, 7: 19.

00:12.205 --> 00:14.426
She's irritating as hell, and you know it.

00:14.427 --> 00:16.657
- I'll admit that she has a style...
- Problem?

00:16.658 --> 00:17.770
Challenge.

00:17.771 --> 00:20.957
School was too hard.
It made me feel so stupid.

00:24.025 --> 00:27.542
He set the curtains on fire
because you left him alone.

00:27.543 --> 00:30.422
When his fellowship comes up
for renoval in November...

00:31.088 --> 00:32.389
I'm not gonna sign off on it.

00:32.390 --> 00:34.205
We talked about all this before.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.653
You've got to tell him.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.867
"Do One, Teach One, Kill One"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:57.138 --> 00:58.548
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:58.722 --> 01:00.133
To what do I owe this?

01:01.683 --> 01:05.132
It's been a great few days.
I kind of wish it wasn't gonna end.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.803
Me neither.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.842
The thought of getting on that train...

01:13.023 --> 01:14.647
I was thinking...

01:16.567 --> 01:21.392
Maybe I'd stay in Chicago some nights,
when I have to work the next day.

01:21.570 --> 01:25.068
- Stay where?
- I don't know. Maybe Doug's.

01:25.947 --> 01:29.030
- Doug's?
- You disapprove?

01:30.575 --> 01:34.820
It's just the thought of all those pretty
girls padding around in their underwear.

01:34.994 --> 01:38.362
Yeah. Beats the YMCA.

01:41.999 --> 01:44.571
You have nothing to worry about.

01:46.418 --> 01:47.450
It was my understanding...

01:47.627 --> 01:49.868
...that a sub-internship
involved more responsibilities.

01:50.045 --> 01:51.918
You wanna do Whipples?
Trisegmentectomies?

01:52.088 --> 01:54.377
I just thought I'd have my own patients.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.876
- What do we got?
- This is Ed.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.080
I'm thirsty, doc.

01:57.258 --> 02:00.507
- When we finish, I'll get you water.
- How about a Scotch and water?

02:00.677 --> 02:03.629
Patient experienced shortness of breath
while in Molly's Saloon.

02:03.803 --> 02:06.922
BP, 120/80. Pulse, 112.
Respirations, 28.

02:07.097 --> 02:11.224
History of emphysema,
congestive heart failure, pneumonia.

02:11.392 --> 02:15.968
Diminished breath sounds were noted
at the base of the patient's right lung.

02:16.144 --> 02:19.559
Intrigued, I tested vocal fremitus,
per Bates, second edition...

02:19.730 --> 02:24.189
...leading me to a diagnosis of pleural
effusion, confirmed by this radiograph...

02:24.357 --> 02:27.807
...which shows fluid
in the patient's right...

02:30.486 --> 02:33.439
...costophrenic sulcus.
- Thank you, Professor Carter.

02:33.614 --> 02:34.775
What do you wanna do?

02:34.947 --> 02:35.978
- Tap the fluid.
- Tap?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.816
- How many taps have you done?
- Eight or nine.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.860
- Run the procedure.
- Prep and drape as usual. Anesthetize.

02:41.034 --> 02:43.073
- What's on tap?
- Procure a 14-gauge needle...

02:43.244 --> 02:44.738
All right.
Call me if you need me.

02:45.787 --> 02:50.115
Oh, and, Carter,
consider Ed here your patient.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.625
Harper, have you ever seen
a pleural tap?

02:57.670 --> 02:59.791
It's 2B, guys.

02:59.962 --> 03:03.247
- Getting tired of life in the fast lane?
- Just of your jokes, Shepard.

03:03.423 --> 03:06.707
Fifteen more minutes, I'm recertified.
I won't have to hear them.

03:06.883 --> 03:09.171
- Those were jokes?
- Up here.

03:15.013 --> 03:19.092
- Smells like he's gone already.
- I wish.

03:20.892 --> 03:24.889
Been sitting there for weeks.
Using himself as a toilet.

03:25.061 --> 03:28.678
He hasn't paid his rent in six months.
I'm losing tenants because of the smell.

03:28.855 --> 03:30.847
He must weigh a ton.
How do we move him?

03:31.064 --> 03:32.439
I brought a dolly.

03:32.774 --> 03:37.019
- Man, his BP's 220/130.
- We'd better take him in.

03:37.193 --> 03:40.277
- Do I have to?
- You don't want to go to the hospital?

03:40.445 --> 03:43.978
I'd rather stay here with my rabbits.

03:45.449 --> 03:49.693
- All right, if he doesn't wanna go...
- The sheriff said you'd take him.

03:49.867 --> 03:53.200
- We don't run an eviction service here.
- We can't just leave him.

03:53.370 --> 03:56.204
- He doesn't want to come.
- He's not competent to decide that.

03:56.371 --> 03:58.909
- How do we know that?
- Look at him.

04:04.294 --> 04:06.783
So he's eccentric.

04:14.383 --> 04:17.716
- I just cleaned the rig.
- Shep!

04:22.847 --> 04:24.471
Raul...

04:32.727 --> 04:34.268
- Ready?
- Ready.

04:34.436 --> 04:38.136
One, two, three.

05:25.687 --> 05:28.770
- Good morning, Jerry.
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.

05:28.940 --> 05:31.643
- Hello, little girl.
- Yeah.

05:31.816 --> 05:34.105
- Yeah.
- Hello. How's Chloe?

05:34.278 --> 05:37.941
She's become disenchanted
with computer classes.

05:38.112 --> 05:41.280
She's now going to find her bliss
at the Diesel Mechanics Academy.

05:41.449 --> 05:42.908
Good school.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.648
How come I'm already signed up
for four patients already?

05:45.827 --> 05:47.986
Courtesy of Doc Weaver.

05:48.163 --> 05:52.290
- I'm not on for another 10 minutes.
- Eight. Morning, baby.

05:52.457 --> 05:55.374
Kerry, I appreciate the vote
of confidence...

05:55.543 --> 05:57.831
...but I'm used to signing up
for patients one at a time.

05:58.129 --> 06:01.912
Mark and I decided residents should
carry at least four patients.

06:02.131 --> 06:03.627
Jerry, are my labs ready?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.587
I'm on a tight deadline.
The interviews have to be today.

06:06.761 --> 06:10.591
Harve from Radiology is coming down
at noon to take your picture.

06:10.763 --> 06:12.672
- Morning, Susan.
- Yeah, right.

06:12.848 --> 06:15.848
- What publication is this?
- Nursing newsletter.

06:16.017 --> 06:19.219
- The swimsuit issue?
- A cover story on our newest Attending.

06:19.395 --> 06:22.845
And I want quotes from all of you.
So get your thinking caps out.

06:23.023 --> 06:26.771
- You're a shameless self-promoter.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:26.944 --> 06:28.520
Nice shirt, Jer.

06:34.573 --> 06:37.147
- Consent on Bed 5.
- Just leave it.

06:37.327 --> 06:40.659
- I need your Juan Hancock.
- Hey, Jeanie. Look, we need to talk.

06:40.829 --> 06:44.328
Seven o'clock. Same spot.
Any problems, beep me. All right?

06:45.457 --> 06:47.116
Girlfriend?

07:01.679 --> 07:04.049
Carotid bruits, papilledema.

07:04.974 --> 07:08.969
Mitchell? Do you have headaches
or loss of consciousness?

07:09.142 --> 07:13.222
Sometimes I sort of drift off.

07:13.396 --> 07:15.517
Well, it's a good thing that you're here.

07:15.689 --> 07:18.096
He's at risk for a cerebral hemorrhage.

07:18.275 --> 07:22.686
Let's start him with a Nipride drip
and get a CT.

07:22.861 --> 07:25.020
Can I borrow your pen?

07:25.197 --> 07:28.447
- Burning the candle?
- Paramedic ride-along all night.

07:41.292 --> 07:44.910
- Hey. How's he doing?
- He's clean.

07:45.087 --> 07:47.792
Yeah, it's more than I can say
for my rig.

07:50.759 --> 07:53.213
What's the matter, Mitchell?

07:53.385 --> 07:55.959
What's gonna happen to my rabbits?

07:56.138 --> 07:58.047
Oh, they'll be okay.

07:59.056 --> 08:02.722
How? Who's gonna feed them?

08:07.229 --> 08:09.934
No. No. No way.

08:10.107 --> 08:12.859
If nobody feeds them,
they're all gonna die.

08:15.569 --> 08:16.898
Shep...?

08:20.324 --> 08:21.355
What happened?

08:21.533 --> 08:22.990
Mother couldn't wake him up
from his nap.

08:23.159 --> 08:25.152
- Is he breathing?
- Barely. Pulse is weak.

08:25.328 --> 08:27.402
- Did he swallow something?
- I don't think so.

08:27.578 --> 08:29.488
- Has he been sick?
- Yes.

08:29.664 --> 08:31.572
- He been on any kind of medication?
- Yes.

08:31.749 --> 08:35.828
- Bactrim, phenytoin, AZT...
- AZT? He's got AIDS?

08:36.001 --> 08:38.373
- AIDS? Yes.
- Dilantin.

08:38.546 --> 08:42.460
You have him on phenytoin and Dilantin
at the same time?

08:42.633 --> 08:44.671
It's the same thing.
He's OD'd on Dilantin.

08:44.842 --> 08:48.091
- Let's get an intubation tray, damn it.
- I give too much?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.587
Yes, you gave too much.
Way too much.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.301
CBC, Chem-7.
Pull that thing off. There we go.

08:53.474 --> 08:56.225
Get a Dilantin level and set up
for a gastric lavage.

08:56.392 --> 08:58.266
We have to pump his stomach.

08:59.979 --> 09:02.136
I'll hold his head.

09:02.313 --> 09:03.938
Okay, here we go.

09:04.567 --> 09:08.184
- He's in.
- All right, bag him. Let's get that lavage.

09:08.361 --> 09:10.934
Come on, little guy.

09:15.491 --> 09:20.485
I need some Cetacaine. Grab some
Surgilube with 30 grams of charcoal.

09:21.538 --> 09:25.036
You go in right over the top
of rib number eight...

09:26.251 --> 09:30.708
...at the posterior axillary line,
advancing and aspirating as you go.

09:30.878 --> 09:33.369
- I gotta call home.
- Your wife?

09:33.548 --> 09:37.248
No, not for me. Why buy the cow
when you get the milk for free?

09:37.425 --> 09:40.212
Take care to avoid
the neurovascular bundle.

09:40.386 --> 09:42.509
I gotta call Olaf, my roomie.

09:42.679 --> 09:46.426
I left half a sandwich in the fridge, and I
don't want anything to happen to it.

09:46.598 --> 09:49.433
Now is not a good time,
because we're about to draw fluid.

09:49.601 --> 09:51.973
- I bet he's over at Molly's.
- Who's Molly?

09:52.145 --> 09:54.387
She's a bar. My bar.

09:54.563 --> 09:58.310
- VoilÃ .
- Oh, that's better. That's better.

10:04.488 --> 10:08.899
- Why'd it stop?
- Sometimes you hit an adhesion.

10:12.787 --> 10:14.197
- Damn.
- Should I get Benton?

10:14.371 --> 10:16.163
No.

10:18.498 --> 10:21.203
- Whoops.
- What'd you do?! What'd you do?!

10:21.376 --> 10:23.535
- I'm gonna get Benton.
- No, he's my patient.

10:23.711 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, yeah.
Get him, get him, get him.

10:26.797 --> 10:30.840
- Dilantin level is 40.
- Double dose. No surprise.

10:35.096 --> 10:37.088
What's her name?

10:37.263 --> 10:40.099
- Ma'am, what's your name?
- Mei-Sun.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.599
- What's your little boy's name?
- Chia-Chia.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.019
I'm gonna tell you what we're doing.
We've washed all the medicine out.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.604
Now we're putting charcoal in
his stomach to absorb what's left.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.145
Doug?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.310
Hey. Hi, buddy.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.157
Don't be scared, all right?

11:02.826 --> 11:06.607
You got a little sick, and your mom
brought you to the hospital.

11:06.787 --> 11:08.945
She's right here. Come on.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.625
- What happened?
- I pushed it too far.

11:25.802 --> 11:28.506
You were supposed to tap his lung,
not biopsy his liver.

11:28.678 --> 11:32.260
Let's get him up to the O.R., now!
He needs a room. Move!

11:35.351 --> 11:38.304
I don't believe this. There goes
next year's surgical residency.

11:38.478 --> 11:40.600
Carter!

11:47.568 --> 11:50.817
I've known Mark Greene since he was
a wet-behind-the-ears med student.

11:50.987 --> 11:54.819
He had the most beautiful curly
blond hair, and so polite.

11:54.991 --> 11:57.991
All I'd do was ask,
and he would be cleaning the bedpans...

11:58.160 --> 12:01.278
...and changing the sheets.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.780
He was the best scut-puppy I ever had.

12:03.957 --> 12:07.040
So would you say that, back then,
he was sort of "green"?

12:07.709 --> 12:10.200
No, Wendy, I would never say that.

12:10.379 --> 12:14.542
Okay, retract the liver inferiorly
and rotate the right lobe.

12:15.383 --> 12:17.671
- There she blows.
- Hit the hepatic vein.

12:17.842 --> 12:19.918
- Nice shot, Carter.
- 5-O proline.

12:20.094 --> 12:23.378
I'm really sorry, Dr. Hicks.
When I felt resistance it felt exactly...

12:23.554 --> 12:27.339
...like an adhesion, and with
the patient's history of emphysema...

12:27.517 --> 12:30.885
Oh, one-handed.
Peter, you've been practicing.

12:31.061 --> 12:36.185
Carter, it happens. It's all right. My best
student once did a sigmoidoscopy.

12:36.357 --> 12:39.357
Punched through and saw the appendix.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.359
- Sound familiar, Peter?
- Metz.

12:42.528 --> 12:46.572
I'm more concerned now with the
condition of this man's liver. Feel that.

12:46.740 --> 12:50.191
Hard as a rock
and shriveled like an old shoe.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.608
- Gallon-a-day drinker.
- At least.

12:52.785 --> 12:56.735
Look at the size of those mesenteric
veins. What does that suggest, Carter?

12:56.915 --> 13:00.081
- Portal hypertension.
- What are the hallmarks of that?

13:00.251 --> 13:05.042
Caput medusa, esophageal varices,
hemorrhoids, ascites, splenomegaly.

13:05.213 --> 13:08.415
Good. I wouldn't give this liver
three weeks.

13:08.590 --> 13:12.291
- NG's returning blood.
- Varices are bleeding. Lucky we're here.

13:12.469 --> 13:17.094
- Portal bypass?
- We could, but with a liver this oozy...

13:17.264 --> 13:20.846
- Have you ever done a TIPS procedure?
- No, but I'd like to.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.717
I bet. In fact, it's an excellent case
for teaching.

13:24.894 --> 13:28.015
Sylvia, round up all
surgical residents who aren't busy.

13:28.190 --> 13:32.435
Tell them we're starting a TIPS.
Standing room only.

13:32.609 --> 13:36.108
What do you know, Carter?
You did this guy a favor.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.958
- Mr. Holthouse?
- Yes?

13:58.213 --> 14:01.877
- I'm Dr. Lewis. What is that?
- Tibetan singing bowl.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.586
I get anxious in hospitals.
It helps me to relax.

14:04.759 --> 14:07.048
I understand you're feeling dizzy
this morning.

14:07.220 --> 14:11.927
Yes, I've had these spinning sensations
on and off all week.

14:12.098 --> 14:15.467
- Headaches?
- No. Some nausea though.

14:15.643 --> 14:18.513
- Spots before your eyes?
- No.

14:18.687 --> 14:21.853
Say, you're under a lot of stress
right now, aren't you?

14:22.023 --> 14:24.727
- Who isn't?
- I can see the tension in your face.

14:25.359 --> 14:27.932
I could suggest
some relaxation techniques.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.649
I'm a lot more relaxed than I look.
Open your mouth.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.481
Hey, big guy. Love the tie.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.745
Thank you, Malik.
Thank you very much.

14:42.789 --> 14:45.742
- What's the occasion?
- Well, since you asked...

14:45.916 --> 14:47.909
...I've been promoted.
- To what?

14:48.085 --> 14:50.706
Supervising emergency-service
coordinator.

14:50.879 --> 14:53.452
More money, huh?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.880
Unfortunately, no.

14:57.050 --> 14:59.755
- Better benefits?
- No.

14:59.928 --> 15:02.762
More responsibility?

15:02.930 --> 15:06.464
- No.
- Well, congratulations.

15:06.641 --> 15:09.428
Mark, that big guy, Mitchell,
he's seizing.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.520
Let's make some room.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.641
Bite block.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.687
Point-five Ativan IV push.

15:20.861 --> 15:24.809
- Positive Babinski.
- Pinpoint pupils. Does not bode well.

15:24.989 --> 15:28.404
- Pressure's up, 250/140.
- All right, jack up the Nipride.

15:28.575 --> 15:30.448
- Load him up with Dilantin.
- How much?

15:30.618 --> 15:33.488
Let's see. He's about 400 pounds.

15:33.662 --> 15:37.197
- Divided by 2.2 is...
- 181 kilograms.

15:37.374 --> 15:39.829
Times 12 milligrams per kilogram
would be...

15:40.000 --> 15:43.499
2730.
I have a facility for simple math.

15:44.629 --> 15:48.079
All right, we'll start with a gram
and we'll titrate up.

15:48.257 --> 15:50.332
Come on, Mitchell, stay with us.

15:50.509 --> 15:52.216
Stay with us, Mitchell. Come on.

15:55.179 --> 15:59.389
- Vitals are coming back to normal.
- Get him to Pedes ICU.

15:59.557 --> 16:04.016
Hey, there, Chia-Chia. How you doing?
I'm Doug.

16:04.228 --> 16:07.845
- He doesn't like doctors.
- Bet he sees a lot of us.

16:08.023 --> 16:11.521
- Where do you take him?
- Pediatric clinic upstairs.

16:11.692 --> 16:14.526
- Who's the doctor?
- Always a different one.

16:14.694 --> 16:16.354
- They're pretty busy.
- Yes.

16:16.613 --> 16:21.854
Very nice, but sometime we wait four,
five hour.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.528
It's hard for him.

16:24.744 --> 16:26.783
I have to make sure
this medication problem...

16:26.954 --> 16:29.657
...doesn't happen again,
so I have to ask you...

16:29.831 --> 16:35.584
- I mean, can you read English?
- Yes, I follow direction.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.125
This one from two week ago.

16:42.299 --> 16:45.502
And this one from yesterday.

16:50.054 --> 16:52.676
Two prescriptions for the same thing.

16:54.850 --> 16:58.266
You did exactly what they asked you to.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.816
I'm sorry that I was angry with you.
This is not your fault.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.236
This is the doctors at the clinic's fault.

17:11.489 --> 17:15.733
Okay, all right.
Next time bring Chia-Chia here.

17:15.909 --> 17:20.535
You give this to the nurse out front,
and she will bring you straight back.

17:20.704 --> 17:23.325
No waiting. Okay?

17:24.333 --> 17:27.949
- Oh, oh, I thought he didn't like doctors.
- Chia-Chia, no.

17:29.252 --> 17:31.328
It's okay.
He can hang on to it for a while.

17:31.505 --> 17:33.496
You can keep that.

17:37.843 --> 17:40.333
- Mr. Holthouse?
- Over here.

17:43.722 --> 17:46.343
I see you're feeling much better.

17:46.515 --> 17:50.133
Yeah, but I still have that spinning
feeling, even upside-down.

17:50.352 --> 17:52.808
Have a seat.
Tony'll take you for a CAT scan.

17:53.022 --> 17:57.481
- Doesn't that cause cancer?
- Susan, a word, please.

18:00.151 --> 18:03.602
- Why are you ordering a CT for vertigo?
- Why are you questioning my orders?

18:03.780 --> 18:07.278
- Because it's a $ 1500 procedure.
- I have to rule out acoustic neuroma.

18:07.449 --> 18:09.358
He's had five bouts of dizziness
in a week.

18:09.535 --> 18:10.909
Wouldn't know from his chart.

18:11.077 --> 18:13.069
I haven't had time.
I've had other patients.

18:13.245 --> 18:15.238
So do I. I manage to keep track
of details.

18:15.414 --> 18:18.829
- So have I, on my note cards.
- Well, I don't have access to those.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.578
Here.

18:20.752 --> 18:25.246
Put them on the chart. And in the future,
run all procedures by me.

18:39.016 --> 18:41.553
- Hey, what happened?
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

18:41.726 --> 18:44.217
He went just like that.

18:44.395 --> 18:48.772
- What are you doing with him?
- Landlady called animal control.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.273
They rounded them up. It was awful.
This guy followed me down the hall.

18:52.442 --> 18:57.104
- Is he clean?
- Sure, he's clean. And he's soft too.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.521
Poor fat guy. He never hurt anybody.

18:59.698 --> 19:04.193
Just sat around with his bunnies,
singing that nutty song.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.367
What was it?

19:12.542 --> 19:15.032
Vienna.

19:34.226 --> 19:38.802
No, he's a patient of yours.
Chia-Chia Loew. A 4-year-old with AIDS.

19:38.979 --> 19:43.225
Try to remember, because you
almost killed him by giving him Dilantin...

19:43.399 --> 19:46.768
...when one of your cohorts
already had him on phenytoin.

19:46.944 --> 19:49.232
Do you people talk to each other?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.899
Making friends again?

19:53.073 --> 19:57.320
Idiots at the Pedes clinic doubled up
a kid's prescription. Almost killed him.

19:57.952 --> 20:00.359
- Get her off my back.
- Her?

20:00.537 --> 20:03.573
Weaver. She just dressed me down
in the hallway for ordering a CT.

20:03.749 --> 20:08.292
- We're getting pressure from upstairs.
- She treats me with disdain.

20:08.461 --> 20:12.243
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yeah. Tell her to cut me some slack.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.636
See how Peter's snaking the sheath
through the vena cava...

20:24.807 --> 20:26.550
...to the right hepatic vein.

20:28.309 --> 20:31.843
- I'm in.
- Now comes the fun part.

20:32.021 --> 20:36.481
Remove the guide wire. Rotate the
needle counterclockwise 90 degrees.

20:36.649 --> 20:41.060
- Pressure's dropping. 80/60.
- Give him pressors and keep me posted.

20:41.904 --> 20:46.647
Puncture the cirrhotic tissue and enter
the portal vein, creating a new pathway.

20:46.823 --> 20:51.449
- Balloon stent's in.
- Expand the balloon slowly...

20:51.619 --> 20:53.825
- Easy...
- We have circulation.

20:53.996 --> 20:56.996
- Portal pressure's coming down.
- And the liver is reborn.

20:57.165 --> 20:58.992
- Hallelujah.
- He's getting tachy, 180.

20:59.167 --> 21:01.408
Fixed his liver.
Not much we can do for his heart.

21:01.585 --> 21:03.127
Run of five.

21:03.336 --> 21:06.835
- Get out of there, Peter.
- I'm getting out.

21:07.006 --> 21:09.164
- He's fibrillating.
- Carter, CPR.

21:09.341 --> 21:11.418
Come on, Ed. Come on.

21:11.594 --> 21:13.881
- Charge it to 200. Clear!
- Stand back.

21:21.894 --> 21:25.178
- Hey, Kerry. How's it going?
- Pretty good.

21:25.353 --> 21:28.058
But there's something we need
to talk about.

21:28.231 --> 21:30.057
Susan Lewis.

21:30.233 --> 21:33.352
This is a bit awkward.
I mean, I know you two are friends.

21:33.527 --> 21:37.523
She seems to resent my being here,
and it's creating some tension.

21:37.696 --> 21:41.195
- You know, I've picked up on that.
- It has nothing to do with her ability.

21:41.366 --> 21:45.494
She's really quite competent,
but her attitude is openly hostile.

21:45.662 --> 21:47.902
It's probably a communication thing.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.246
You're very authoritative,
which is great.

21:51.416 --> 21:54.286
But your assertiveness might be
off-putting to some.

21:54.459 --> 21:55.872
I'm aware of that.

21:56.046 --> 21:59.128
That's why I bend over backwards
to be sensitive with Susan.

21:59.298 --> 22:03.958
I'd rather you not say anything,
but this is a potential problem area.

22:04.134 --> 22:07.088
Right. Thank you.

22:14.059 --> 22:17.807
Picture-perfect procedure, Benton.
Save the tape. We'll show it at M&M.

22:17.979 --> 22:20.931
Carter, you can present.
It'll be your first time.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.065
I'll tell him.

22:30.822 --> 22:34.949
- My first official patient.
- Carter, the guy was a train wreck.

22:35.118 --> 22:38.616
He died of heart failure. It had nothing
to do with you perfing his liver.

22:41.247 --> 22:43.037
If he hadn't been on the operating table...

22:43.206 --> 22:46.741
Then his liver would've failed in a month.

22:48.335 --> 22:50.624
- I'll tell the family.
- He didn't have any.

22:50.796 --> 22:54.294
Carter, it's how you learn.

22:54.465 --> 22:56.873
It'll make you a better doctor.

23:00.552 --> 23:03.090
What can I say about Mark Greene
that hasn't been said?

23:03.263 --> 23:07.639
Everybody knows how he overcame
adversity as a child of Quakers.

23:07.808 --> 23:12.018
His years in exile, his political writings
and limericks...

23:12.186 --> 23:15.471
...his mod period with the turtlenecks,
his blue period...

23:15.647 --> 23:20.024
...and of course his ruthless march
to power and the silencing of his rivals.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.437
Dr. Ross?

23:23.612 --> 23:25.604
Dr. Ross!

23:31.243 --> 23:32.820
Which one do you think?

23:32.994 --> 23:36.244
- It's for the nursing newsletter?
- Yeah. You think this one?

23:36.414 --> 23:39.864
I'm looking for the supervising
emergency-service coordinator.

23:40.042 --> 23:42.958
- You've found him.
- Oh. Hi, I'm Randi.

23:43.919 --> 23:47.004
I'm the new clerk. I understand
I'll be working under you.

23:47.172 --> 23:51.548
Right. I was expecting a guy,
because of the name.

23:51.717 --> 23:53.211
Randi, right. I get that a lot.

23:53.845 --> 23:58.303
Personnel said that you would have some
immunization forms for me to fill out.

23:58.472 --> 24:03.299
You'll need a rubella and a Heptovax.
Lab's on the second floor.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.679
They said I'd need a physical,
and that somebody here could do it.

24:06.854 --> 24:11.148
Jerry, you got any charts for me?
Any patients? Anything?

24:17.529 --> 24:22.274
All right. I'll be at Pedes ICU.

24:25.785 --> 24:29.534
Carol, quick. Three-hundred-pound
angel-duster broke out of restraints.

24:29.706 --> 24:32.456
- Climbed on the ambulance.
- What is this, crazy-fat-guy day?

24:32.625 --> 24:36.538
- I'm telling you, this dude is mad.
- Call security. Go find Mark Greene.

24:36.711 --> 24:41.253
The tests show nothing serious. I think
your dizziness is caused by labyrinthitis.

24:41.423 --> 24:44.210
- What's that?
- Inflammation of the inner ear. Minor.

24:44.384 --> 24:48.381
- Nothing serious. You swim?
- No. I don't know how.

24:48.554 --> 24:52.136
But I do spend a lot of time floating
in my sensory-deprivation tank.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.796
Not for the next two weeks you don't.

24:54.974 --> 24:58.807
- No standing on your head, either.
- Dr. Lewis...

24:58.979 --> 25:00.723
I'd like for you to have this.

25:01.522 --> 25:03.514
- No, thanks.
- Please. It's a spare.

25:03.691 --> 25:05.647
It's not necessary. Really.

25:06.150 --> 25:09.601
I think it is. Really.

25:13.907 --> 25:16.397
Oh, God, not another one.

25:16.575 --> 25:17.986
- Watch out, Carol.
- Relax.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.444
- Where am I?! Where am I?!
- Hey, buddy, relax. Just calm down.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.409
Where's Mara? Mara!

25:24.915 --> 25:26.161
Mara?

25:26.750 --> 25:29.157
- Mara?
- Just back off there, Mara.

25:29.336 --> 25:30.746
- What's he on?
- PCP.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.295
I got him.

25:32.462 --> 25:35.499
- You get away from me!
- Are you all right? Are you okay?

25:35.674 --> 25:39.456
- Nobody touches me!
- He's cut. Stay here. I'm taking him in.

25:39.635 --> 25:41.794
- Mara!
- Where the hell is security?!

25:41.970 --> 25:44.542
- My God! I can't see!
- Let's shoot him.

25:44.723 --> 25:47.972
- Let me talk to him.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!

25:48.142 --> 25:51.843
Okay, okay. Hey, what you
doing up there, big guy?

25:52.145 --> 25:54.635
- Mara?
- Yeah. Why don't you come down here.

25:54.813 --> 25:56.390
It's much safer. Okay?

25:56.564 --> 25:58.854
- Mara?
- Yes, babe. Come on down.

25:59.025 --> 26:02.773
Mara! Where's Mara?! Mara! Mara!

26:02.945 --> 26:06.229
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey, no!

26:07.906 --> 26:09.282
Oh, my God!

26:12.536 --> 26:15.371
Oh, Mark, did you and you-know-who
have a you-know-what?

26:15.539 --> 26:17.495
- You bet.
- Good.

26:19.333 --> 26:22.167
And these extensions are
for internal use only.

26:22.336 --> 26:25.621
Dr. Lewis, can you do
an employee physical?

26:25.797 --> 26:26.958
- On?
- Randi?

26:27.130 --> 26:29.538
- Hi.
- Hi. Breathe in.

26:31.343 --> 26:33.879
Breathe out. You're fine.
Where's the form?

26:48.564 --> 26:52.346
Do you have my roommate
as a patient? Ed Menke?

26:52.525 --> 26:56.107
Yes. You must be Olaf?

26:56.904 --> 27:01.280
I'm afraid I have some bad news
about Ed.

27:01.449 --> 27:04.901
He...
He had fluid in his lungs.

27:05.078 --> 27:07.828
During the course of trying
to remove it, we...

27:07.995 --> 27:11.080
I accidentally punctured his liver.

27:11.248 --> 27:15.873
We successfully stopped the bleeding
and did some additional surgery.

27:16.044 --> 27:21.796
But, unfortunately,
his heart gave out, and...

27:21.966 --> 27:25.464
...he died on the table. I'm very sorry.

27:25.635 --> 27:29.797
Yeah, they told me that upstairs.
They said you had his property.

27:30.848 --> 27:34.050
- Property?
- He took the remote-control doohickey.

27:34.226 --> 27:37.807
It's his TV, and he's kind of tightfisted
about it, but...

27:37.978 --> 27:40.100
...I don't think he's gonna mind now.

27:44.317 --> 27:47.269
- Double dose of Haldol.
- It's about time.

27:47.443 --> 27:50.776
- Why don't you try and, you know...
- Right.

27:50.946 --> 27:53.780
Hey! Hey! Hey!

27:53.948 --> 27:55.608
Big guy!

27:55.783 --> 27:58.949
Hi. So are you from Chicago?

28:00.287 --> 28:02.113
Jeez.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.374
Come on. You can do better than that.
You weren't even close.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.119
Come on.

28:10.295 --> 28:13.379
Oh, God! 0 and 2, big guy.

28:13.548 --> 28:15.871
Why don't you just try to put
some mustard on it.

28:16.048 --> 28:20.461
That's it. That's it.
Yeah! Yes! Bull's- eye!

28:23.764 --> 28:25.472
Nice work.

28:30.895 --> 28:34.393
With a regimen of ultrasound and TENS,
he could regain the use of his legs.

28:34.563 --> 28:37.932
- Jeanie. Did you get my message?
- Yeah.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.146
All right. Seven o'clock.

28:41.402 --> 28:45.185
Prisoner found in his cell spitting blood.
Swallowed a dozen razor blades.

28:45.363 --> 28:47.736
- Suicide try?
- Maybe he wanted a field trip.

28:47.908 --> 28:49.982
- Set up for endoscopy?
- Yeah. Get a KUB.

28:50.158 --> 28:54.072
And I'll need a rat-tooth on the scope so
I can grab the blades. Coming through!

28:56.539 --> 28:58.745
Hey, Chloe, what are you doing up here?

28:58.916 --> 29:02.081
Oh, hi. Just talking to my baby.

29:02.251 --> 29:07.493
Why don't you listen to her breathing.
Sounds like she's got pneumonia.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.210
It's just gurgling.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.379
Come here. Yeah.

29:19.556 --> 29:22.131
- You picking little Susie up?
- What?

29:22.310 --> 29:26.176
- You picking little Susie up?
- No, I'm just taking her for a walk.

29:26.354 --> 29:30.731
- Big Susie know that you're here?
- I'm gonna go wait outside.

29:30.899 --> 29:34.646
- You okay?
- Yes. I'm just a little tired, that's all.

29:34.818 --> 29:36.727
See you.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.192
No bleeding in the esophagus
or antrum. H & H back?

29:44.369 --> 29:47.701
- Normal. Fourteen and 42.
- Got one. Razor blade coming up.

29:47.871 --> 29:51.240
- How's his pressure?
- 120/80. Won't that slice up his throat?

29:51.416 --> 29:56.409
- No, because he taped the blades.
- So much for suicide.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.826
What's this about?
Not trying to escape, are you?

29:59.798 --> 30:02.203
- What's this?
- Prisoner swallowed razor blades.

30:02.382 --> 30:05.169
No blood in the gut?
You're done. Pull out the scope.

30:05.343 --> 30:07.548
- He's tubed. I'm not gonna stop now.
- I told you...

30:07.720 --> 30:10.293
...all procedures go through me.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.471
Go get Mark.

30:16.603 --> 30:19.139
Dr. Greene, we need you
in Trauma 1.

30:26.818 --> 30:29.142
- What's up, guys?
- Prisoner swallowed taped razors.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.024
- Kerry wants to leave them.
- Gut's not bleeding.

30:32.197 --> 30:34.687
- It could.
- Hasn't yet. I say let them pass.

30:36.492 --> 30:38.734
It's a judgment call, guys.

30:40.871 --> 30:45.828
If he bleeds, we go in, we take
them out. For now, pull the scope out.

30:50.337 --> 30:51.997
Excuse me.

31:03.888 --> 31:07.304
- You had a patient named Menke, right?
- Yeah. Why?

31:07.476 --> 31:11.886
Dr. Hicks had his liver taken out for
a cirrhosis study at the Standhal clinic.

31:12.061 --> 31:14.932
She said you should arrange
to get it over there.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.227
Ugly little thing, ain't it?

31:29.407 --> 31:31.733
An exciting case?

31:32.743 --> 31:35.862
Here's one: Guy comes in,
hypovolemic shock.

31:36.038 --> 31:37.994
Defibrillated 10, 15 times.

31:38.165 --> 31:40.489
We maxed out on lidocaine,
added bretylium...

31:40.666 --> 31:42.742
...finally shocked him back to sinus.

31:42.918 --> 31:47.544
He goes bradycardic. So I float a
transvenous pacemaker, get capture.

31:47.714 --> 31:53.252
He stops breathing. I had to climb on,
intubate him cowboy-style on the table.

31:53.426 --> 31:56.426
Wow! What happened?

31:58.931 --> 32:00.722
He died.

32:15.443 --> 32:18.278
Please enter the patient's number
before proceeding.

32:19.197 --> 32:20.655
Jerry...?

32:20.824 --> 32:23.396
Dr. Weaver loaded an audio program
onto the computer.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.742
With her own voice?! Where's Greene?

32:26.912 --> 32:29.366
He and Dr. Ross went to the gift shop.

32:32.166 --> 32:36.692
Don't forget to log off.
Don't forget to log off.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.718
Don't forget to log off.

32:38.796 --> 32:41.546
- Are you sure you don't mind?
- You kidding? Anytime.

32:41.714 --> 32:45.794
- How about tonight?
- Tonight I may have company.

32:45.967 --> 32:49.218
Depending on the weather patterns
over Greenland.

32:49.387 --> 32:51.794
Dr. Ross! Next time you get the urge...

32:52.014 --> 32:55.632
...to pick up the phone and scream at
one of my residents, ask for me instead.

32:55.892 --> 32:57.267
Your resident screwed up.

32:57.435 --> 32:59.723
You're not in the position
to make that judgment.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.678
Your job is hanging by a thread,
and I'm the guy with the knife.

33:03.857 --> 33:06.099
You pull this prima-donna crap again...

33:06.276 --> 33:09.311
...and it'll take more than your friend
here to save you.

33:44.889 --> 33:47.296
Hey, didn't see much of you today.

33:47.473 --> 33:49.881
Whatever happened to old Ed?

33:51.060 --> 33:53.432
- Ed?
- Yeah.

33:54.229 --> 33:57.763
- They transplanted him?
- He died.

34:01.400 --> 34:06.275
- From the tap?
- No. Not directly.

34:08.741 --> 34:11.574
- So are they taking away your sub-i?
- Are you kidding?

34:11.743 --> 34:14.578
Hicks and Benton were so excited about
getting to do a TIPS...

34:14.746 --> 34:16.156
...they were glad I screwed up.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.704
Thing is, I didn't really care either.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.993
All I thought was,
"There goes my surgical career. "

34:24.587 --> 34:28.831
So here he is. What a way to go, huh?

34:31.925 --> 34:36.302
Well, from the looks of things,
he knew how to have a good time.

34:38.056 --> 34:40.261
What do you say we give him a sendoff?

34:40.431 --> 34:41.842
What?

34:42.016 --> 34:43.808
Get your coat.

34:48.772 --> 34:53.896
- Hey, quite a day, huh?
- I'm telling you.

34:54.068 --> 34:58.065
- Head okay?
- Yeah, knock on wood.

34:58.655 --> 35:01.276
- Hey, I'm sorry about that.
- Yeah.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.365
Hey, don't worry about it.

35:05.369 --> 35:10.113
- We were pretty good out there today.
- Not bad, huh?

35:11.248 --> 35:13.489
Yeah. We should go out.

35:16.002 --> 35:17.793
- Really?
- Definitely.

35:19.962 --> 35:25.798
Right now is not a really good time
for me, but I've got your number.

35:28.845 --> 35:31.631
You're gonna blow me off,
just like that?

35:32.140 --> 35:36.929
No. Look, I'm just getting over
a relationship, so...

35:38.019 --> 35:39.430
Good night.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.520
You know what your problem is,
Hathaway?

35:42.814 --> 35:45.186
You've gone out with too many doctors.

35:45.358 --> 35:49.984
- You've been checking up on me?
- I'm interested, so I ask.

35:50.695 --> 35:54.062
You're shopping in the wrong part
of the store.

35:54.240 --> 35:57.110
- What?
- You're lost among the Guccis.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.532
And where should I be?

36:01.704 --> 36:03.945
Automotive.

36:13.005 --> 36:17.216
- Shaw's, Friday night, 8:00?
- Okay.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.591
Okay.

37:05.337 --> 37:06.914
Hey, buddy.

37:28.605 --> 37:30.015
Hey...

37:32.734 --> 37:34.725
What's the matter?

37:36.820 --> 37:39.311
It's my fault.

37:41.281 --> 37:45.492
No, it's not your fault. I told you.
It's the doctors' at the clinic.

37:45.660 --> 37:49.871
No, it's my fault he has AIDS.

37:52.457 --> 37:54.746
I gave it to him.

37:55.752 --> 37:57.874
No, that's nobody's fault.

37:58.921 --> 38:02.917
I gave it to him and now he's sick.
And I'm not.

38:04.676 --> 38:06.881
It is punishment.

38:10.430 --> 38:11.924
No.

38:30.278 --> 38:31.902
It's okay.

39:07.558 --> 39:10.511
- Peter, what are you doing here?
- I waited 45 minutes.

39:10.685 --> 39:12.891
- You couldn't even call me?
- I was gonna call.

39:13.062 --> 39:16.015
- So now you're even lying to me?
- What?

39:16.189 --> 39:19.973
- I thought we could talk to each other.
- I needed time to think.

39:20.151 --> 39:22.938
How much time? What was I
supposed to do, get a postcard?

39:23.112 --> 39:25.270
- Keep your voice down.
- Don't tell me what...

39:26.948 --> 39:28.322
Hi.

39:31.410 --> 39:36.035
It's easy for you, Peter. I'm the one
who's had to go home to my husband.

39:36.206 --> 39:39.537
You just hand out ultimatums.
You demand answers...

39:43.669 --> 39:46.586
I knew your answer last week.

39:47.005 --> 39:49.460
- Peter...
- What?

39:53.677 --> 39:55.835
I'm not ready to walk out
on my marriage.

39:58.556 --> 39:59.966
Yeah, right.

40:00.557 --> 40:02.181
You...

40:03.561 --> 40:05.848
You take care of yourself, all right?

40:19.948 --> 40:21.940
What about the weather
over Greenland?

40:22.116 --> 40:25.282
It's this stewardess I've been seeing.
I met her at work.

40:25.452 --> 40:28.369
- A patient?
- Sort of. I put a cast on her.

40:28.538 --> 40:32.369
With her flight schedule, I never know
when she might show up.

40:35.543 --> 40:39.706
- Guess the weather was bad.
- Well, it's just as well.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.414
- Is there a doctor in the house?
- Hey.

40:43.591 --> 40:45.500
Oh, hello.

40:46.510 --> 40:50.174
- Hulda, that's Mark. Mark, that's Hulda.
- Hello.

40:52.014 --> 40:55.632
You know, the Finns are remarkably
unselfconscious.

40:55.809 --> 40:57.765
I see that.

40:58.895 --> 41:00.887
- I cooked you lutefisk.
- Great.

41:02.064 --> 41:04.221
- Set your bag down.
- Yeah.

41:15.908 --> 41:20.319
- Now, we are out of here.
- Susie! Hey, Susie!

41:20.496 --> 41:23.116
- Chloe?
- Yeah.

41:23.289 --> 41:26.989
- Who're you with?
- Oh, that's my friend Ruth.

41:27.168 --> 41:29.373
Hi, Ruth.

41:29.544 --> 41:33.126
- Oh, God, you're loaded.
- Oh, come on...

41:33.297 --> 41:35.419
Chloe!

41:35.590 --> 41:39.587
- Look, everything is gonna be okay.
- What are you on?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.333
- I'm going on a trip.
- The hell you are.

41:42.512 --> 41:47.007
The flea markets, Susie.
You can make a fortune selling old stuff.

41:47.182 --> 41:51.476
- Just stay there. I'll come around.
- No, Susie, I can't. We gotta go.

41:51.644 --> 41:54.764
- You're not abandoning this baby!
- I'll be back.

41:54.938 --> 41:58.271
I just gotta make us some money,
so I can buy us a house.

41:58.441 --> 42:00.932
Chloe, what are you doing?
Don't! Don't do this!

42:01.110 --> 42:05.771
I'm dying inside, Susie. I gotta go.

42:05.947 --> 42:07.774
No, I know. Chloe, it's fine.

42:07.949 --> 42:10.025
- Don't be mad, please.
- It's okay.

42:10.201 --> 42:12.870
I just wanna do something right, okay?

42:13.036 --> 42:16.036
It's okay, I'm not. I'm not!
Chloe, it's okay.

42:16.205 --> 42:19.206
- Bye-bye, baby. Mama loves you.
- Don't go! Chloe, it's okay.

42:19.374 --> 42:21.331
- Hey! Chloe!
- Bye-bye.

42:21.501 --> 42:24.252
- Bye-bye.
- Chloe. Chloe!

42:24.420 --> 42:28.333
- Chloe! It's okay.
- Bye-bye, baby.

42:28.506 --> 42:30.084
Chloe!

42:51.025 --> 42:55.317
- This place is a lot nicer than I expected.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

42:55.486 --> 42:57.693
- What's that?
- A liver.

42:59.030 --> 43:02.981
- What'll it be?
- Whatever's on tap.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.032
Cruel. Very cruel.

43:05.202 --> 43:08.119
- Two?
- Yes, please.

43:09.832 --> 43:13.164
- Which stool's Ed's?
- Your boyfriend's sitting on it.

43:13.334 --> 43:17.709
- You friends of his?
- We knew him.

43:17.878 --> 43:20.832
- He's dead, you know.
- We know.

43:28.011 --> 43:30.762
- To Ed.
- To Ed.

43:38.601 --> 43:40.225
Thank you.

43:40.395 --> 43:42.054
For what?
