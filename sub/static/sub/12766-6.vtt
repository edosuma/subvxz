05:27.208 --> 05:29.417

05:29.458 --> 05:31.417

URGENT HOSPITAL BUSINESS.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.041

05:33.083 --> 05:36.041

05:36.083 --> 05:37.333
AS HOSPITAL BUSINESS.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.959
I'VE HAD THREE HOURS
IN THREE DAYS.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.375
PLACE WOULDN'T RUN WITHOUT ME,
NOT THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THE...

05:43.417 --> 05:45.041
THE...
YEAH.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.125
WORDS?

05:56.166 --> 05:57.542
WORDS.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.959

OF BREATH WHEN YOU LIE DOWN,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.458
CHEST PAINS?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.959

THYROID, EVERYTHING.

IS OUT THERE LOOKING.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.125
MAYBE I SHOULD BE OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR WHAT I WANT.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.125
YEAH, AND WHAT YOU WANT
IS A HUSBAND AND KIDS.
DR. BENNETT, DR. MONTGOMERY.

AT THE LAB STILL,

07:22.083 --> 07:24.041

HIS TESTS ARE VIABLE.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.041
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
YEP, THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON

07:26.083 --> 07:29.041
WHY THE TWO OF YOU
CAN'T GET PREGNANT.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I WAS HOPING...

07:29.083 --> 07:30.667
YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:30.709 --> 07:32.041
WHEN RAY COMES BACK,

07:32.083 --> 07:34.291
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
HE'S INFERTILE.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.041
I'M SORRY?

07:36.083 --> 07:40.000
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM IT'S
HIS FAULT WE CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

07:47.291 --> 07:48.250

TO YOUR HUSBAND

07:48.291 --> 07:50.250
ABOUT TRYING TO HAVE CHILDREN?

07:50.291 --> 07:52.709
NOT EXACTLY. I JUST--I JUST
WAS ON THE PILL FOR YEARS.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.542
AND THEN I GOT
A CERVICAL CAP.
THAT'S LYING.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.041
I HAVE MY REASONS.
WHICH ARE?

07:58.083 --> 08:00.041
I JUST--I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE KIDS.

08:00.083 --> 08:03.917
LOOK, RAY--HE COMES FROM
A BIG FAMILY. HE LOVES KIDS.

08:03.959 --> 08:09.166
HE'S GOOD AND KIND,
AND HE ADORES ME SO MUCH.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.625
HOW CAN YOU TELL SOMEONE
WHO LOVES YOU LIKE THAT

08:11.667 --> 08:13.625
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A BABY WITH THEM?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.583
I'M SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T LIE
TO HIM ABOUT HIS TEST RESULTS.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.041
THEN WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.959
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN IT SOUNDS.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.959
I THINK THE LIE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING

08:24.000 --> 08:27.166
IS FAR WORSE
THAN THE TRUTH.
NO, IT'S NOT.

08:27.208 --> 08:29.083
(knock on door)

08:29.125 --> 08:33.041
THERE YOU ARE.
I'M ALL DONE. WHAT NOW?

08:33.083 --> 08:35.041
NOW...

08:35.083 --> 08:38.625
NOW WE GO HOME
AND KEEP TRYING.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.959
OKAY. GOOD-BYE.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.542
CAN I JUST SAY... WHOA?

08:43.583 --> 08:44.792
RIGHT.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.041
(sighs)

08:46.083 --> 08:48.625
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
SLEEP WAS FOR THE WEAK.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.542
WOULD YOU
PUT THAT THING AWAY?

08:50.583 --> 08:53.166
NOW I JUST LIE THERE.
IT'S TORTURE.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.166
INSOMNIA IS NOT CAUSED
BY HOW YOU SLEEP.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.166
IT'S CAUSED BY HOW YOU LIVE.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.417
AND THIS ISN'T HELPING.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.875
NO E-MAILS.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.625
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.458
(sighs)

09:06.500 --> 09:09.625
TRY TO RELAX.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.333
IT'S HARD TO RELAX

09:13.375 --> 09:15.875
WHEN YOU'RE STICKING QUARTERS
ON MY HEAD.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.875
I'M STIMULATING
THE SLEEP CENTER OF THE BRAIN

09:17.917 --> 09:20.041
WITH MAGNETS.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.208
SO...
YOU WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,

09:23.250 --> 09:25.375
SUFFERED THROUGH RESIDENCY
LIKE THE REST OF US.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.417
YOU COULD BE SAVING LIVES
RIGHT NOW.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.417
WHY DID YOU DITCH
THE GOOD STUFF

09:29.458 --> 09:32.417
FOR MAGNETS AND HOODOO?

09:32.458 --> 09:35.875
WHAT I DO IS THE GOOD STUFF.
NOW SHH.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.208
SHH.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.041
(New Age music playing)

09:47.083 --> 09:48.834
(sighs)

09:48.875 --> 09:50.875
(music continues)

09:52.875 --> 09:54.041
MOVE IT, COOP.

09:54.083 --> 09:58.041
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY
PAY ME TO LIE ON THAT COUCH.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.041
I'M REVIEWING
TESS SULLIVAN'S FILM

10:00.083 --> 10:01.458
FROM HER LAST DOCTOR.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.333
SHE HAD A HUMERUS FRACTURE WHEN
SHE WAS YOUNGER FROM A FALL.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.917
OKAY.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.917
EXCEPT AS I SUSPECTED,
SHE ACTUALLY HAD

10:07.959 --> 10:09.959
A SPIRAL FRACTURE
OF HER HUMERUS.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.417
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THAT?
SOMEONE GRABS YOUR ARM

10:12.458 --> 10:15.417
AND TWISTS IT SO HARD,
IT SNAPS.
SO SOMEONE HURT HER
ON PURPOSE.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.041
MORE FUN FACTS--
THESE RECORDS

10:17.083 --> 10:19.917
FROM BEFORE TESS AND MARILYN
TRANSFERRED HERE,

10:19.959 --> 10:21.959
SHE HAD MULTIPLE FALLS
AND ACCIDENTS.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.333
COOPER, IF IT'S ABUSE,

10:23.375 --> 10:25.875
IT'S USUALLY THE ADULT
IN THE HOUSE.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.750
MARILYN?

10:27.792 --> 10:29.750
HER DAUGHTER LOVES HER.
EVERYBODY LOVES HER.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.041
SAM LOVES HER--

10:31.083 --> 10:33.125
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.166
AND NOW I HAVE TO CALL
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES

10:38.208 --> 10:41.083
TO PROTECT MY PATIENT
FROM SAM'S PATIENT.

10:43.083 --> 10:47.041
(New Age music playing)

10:54.125 --> 10:56.208
YOU'RE AFRAID OF KILLING PEOPLE,
AREN'T YOU?

10:56.250 --> 10:58.375
EXCUSE ME?

10:58.417 --> 11:00.667
THAT'S WHY YOU WASTE YOUR TIME
WITH THE NEW AGE STUFF.

11:00.709 --> 11:02.041
YOU'RE AFRAID
OF KILLING SOMEONE.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.625
(music continues)

11:03.667 --> 11:05.041
I'M LYING HERE WIDE AWAKE.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.041
THE THOUGHT OCCURS.
THAT'S ALL.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.291
OKAY, LOOK...
IT'S ALMOST 6:00.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.041
I'M GONNA SEND YOU HOME

11:11.083 --> 11:13.041
WITH A CD OF MUSIC
AND MEDITATION.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.041
TRY IT TONIGHT
AND REPORT BACK.

11:15.083 --> 11:19.041
GREAT. NEXT YOU'LL BE
GIVING ME "BABY EINSTEIN."

11:19.083 --> 11:22.000
(music continues)

11:28.083 --> 11:29.250
NO. NO.

11:29.291 --> 11:32.041
THERE'S NO WAY MARILYN SULLIVAN
WOULD--WOULD HURT TESS.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.041
SHE'S ALWAYS COMING IN
WITH SCRATCHES AND BRUISES.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.041
MAYBE IT'S--IT'S A KID
AT SCHOOL.

11:36.083 --> 11:39.125
I TALKED TO THE SCHOOL.
THAT'S NOT IT.
WELL, IT'S NOT MARILYN.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.125
WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S FUNNY?
BECAUSE SHE'S A WRITER?

11:41.166 --> 11:42.959
THERE'S A HISTORICALLY
STABLE GROUP.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.959
NO, BECAUSE SHE'S DECENT.
ALL RIGHT?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.041
SHE'S HANDLING HER DISEASE,
HER KID.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.792
THE WOMAN IS TWO YEARS AWAY
FROM A WHEELCHAIR.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.250
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THIS
ON A HUNCH.
WHAT ABOUT
THE NEXT TIME, SAM?

11:52.291 --> 11:55.041
WHAT, I IGNORE THIS
AND THE NEXT TIME TESS ENDS UP

11:55.083 --> 11:57.125
IN A HOSPITAL OR WORSE?
UNLESS YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY SURE,

11:57.166 --> 12:00.542
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS PUTTING
THESE PEOPLE THROUGH THIS.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.625
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,
YOU'RE MEDDLING, NOT HELPING.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.000
(whistles)

12:20.083 --> 12:21.500
YOU'RE HERE EARLY.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.000
YEAH.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.000
YEAH, THANKS.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.542
OKAY.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.959
(telephone rings)

12:47.000 --> 12:48.959
(electronic female voice)
You have reached

12:49.000 --> 12:50.208
the Los Angeles County

12:50.250 --> 12:52.208
Department of Children
and Family Services

12:52.250 --> 12:54.041
Child Protection Hotline.

12:54.083 --> 12:57.041
(elevator bell dings)

12:57.083 --> 12:59.458
HEY, SHE'S BACK.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.625
WHO?

13:00.667 --> 13:01.834
ANGIE.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.083
LIAR-LIAR-PANTS-ON-FIRE
ANGIE.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.125
WELL, WHAT--
WHAT DO WE DO?

13:06.166 --> 13:08.875
WE THROW HER ASS
OUT OF OUR PRACTICE.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.083
COME ON. HEY.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.333
OKAY.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.041
THANKS, DELL.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.041
HERE YOU GO.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.125
OKAY.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.166
(exhales)

13:18.208 --> 13:20.250
ANGIE.

13:20.291 --> 13:23.875
I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME BACK,

13:23.917 --> 13:26.125
BUT I LOOKED UP DR. MONTGOMERY
ON THE INTERNET.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.041
YOU'RE A GENETIC SPECIALIST,
RIGHT?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.125
YES.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.709
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID,

13:31.750 --> 13:34.041
THAT IT'S BETTER
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

13:34.083 --> 13:37.375
SO YOU TOLD RAY THAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY KIDS?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.583
NO. NOT THAT.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.709
ANGIE, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN HELP YOU HERE.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.709
YOU HAVE TO.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.208
I NEED TO KNOW.
I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT?

13:47.250 --> 13:51.083
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHETHER OR NOT I'M DYING.

13:58.125 --> 14:01.083
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE?
IT'S A GENETIC DISORDER
THAT CAUSES--

14:01.125 --> 14:03.083
A DEGENERATION OF BRAIN CELLS.
WE KNOW.

14:03.125 --> 14:06.041
SO THEN YOU KNOW
HOW HORRIBLE IT IS.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.041
YOU LOSE CONTROL
OF YOUR BODY,

14:08.083 --> 14:10.041
YOUR BRAIN ATROPHIES,
YOU CAN'T TALK,

14:10.083 --> 14:12.041
YOU CAN'T EAT.

14:12.083 --> 14:18.000
YOU JUST SLOWLY DIE
IN THIS--THIS SHELL.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.625
MY MOM HAD IT.

14:20.667 --> 14:21.959
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD IT.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.625
AND YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT HAVE IT?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.542
IF HER MOTHER HAD IT,
SHE HAS A 50-50 CHANCE

14:27.583 --> 14:29.625
OF INHERITING THE GENE.
AND IF I HAVE THE GENE,

14:29.667 --> 14:32.375
I HAVE A 100% CHANCE
OF DYING FROM THE DISEASE.

14:32.417 --> 14:35.041
BUT YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN TESTED?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.125
I JUST WANTED
TO LIVE MY LIFE.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.041
AND THEN I MET RAY.

14:40.083 --> 14:43.667
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
YOU COULD HAVE HUNTINGTON'S?

14:43.709 --> 14:45.667
I WASN'T LOOKING
TO GET MARRIED.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.917
IT WAS JUST DATING.

14:47.959 --> 14:50.709
AND THEN WE WERE IN LOVE.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.834
AND THEN...

14:52.875 --> 14:54.834
I HAD WAITED TOO LONG
TO TELL HIM.

14:54.875 --> 14:58.000
AND HE LOVED ME SO MUCH,
I DIDN'T WANT TO SCARE HIM.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.000
I DIDN'T WANT TO SCARE ME.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.583
BUT NOW--

15:02.625 --> 15:04.041
HE WANTS TO HAVE CHILDREN.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.041
I CAN'T HAVE A BABY

15:06.083 --> 15:08.041
KNOWING I COULD
PASS THIS ON.

15:08.083 --> 15:12.625
I CAN'T HAVE A BABY
IF I'M GONNA DIE.

15:12.667 --> 15:18.000
LAST NIGHT, RAY AND I
WERE WATCHING TV IN BED.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.417
AND HE WAS THINKING UP
BABY NAMES.

15:24.458 --> 15:28.333
AND MY HEART
STARTED TO HURT...

15:28.375 --> 15:32.041
PHYSICALLY HURT.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.041
I WANT TO THINK UP
BABY NAMES.

15:35.083 --> 15:38.041
I WANT TO GROW OLD
WITH THIS MAN

15:38.083 --> 15:41.041
AND OUR KIDS
AND OUR GRANDKIDS.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.041
AND I THOUGHT...

15:43.083 --> 15:45.041
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE
THE GENE.

15:45.083 --> 15:49.041
MAYBE I WON'T GET SICK.
MAYBE--

15:49.083 --> 15:52.041
MAYBE KNOWING THE TRUTH
IS BETTER THAN HIDING FROM IT.

15:52.083 --> 15:56.000
I WANT THE TEST.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.792
I WANT TO KNOW.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.709
I WANT TO LIVE.

16:05.083 --> 16:08.041
UGH. HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE HEARD
OF AN EXPIRATION DATE?

16:08.083 --> 16:11.041
NO, NO, NO. THOSE ARE--
THOSE ARE--NOODLES DON'T GO BAD.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.041
OH, SHE'S BACK.
WHAT...

16:13.083 --> 16:15.458
(lowers voice)
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
THROWING AWAY
PEOPLE'S NOODLES.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.041
(Charlotte) I'M HERE BECAUSE--
SURPRISE--

16:18.083 --> 16:20.959
I CAN'T FALL ASLEEP TO PETE'S
MEDLEY OF DRUID MATING RITUALS.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.959
CAN YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF MY FOOD, PLEASE?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.083
DID YOU MAKE THE CALL?
YEAH.

16:25.125 --> 16:28.792
HEY, VIOLET, WE HAVE A PATIENT
WE MAY NEED YOU TO SEE. ANGIE?

16:28.834 --> 16:31.375
SHE STILL LYING
TO HER HUSBAND?
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.375
SHE MIGHT HAVE
A TERMINAL ILLNESS.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.041
DELL'S PREPARING
AN EXAM ROOM,

16:35.083 --> 16:37.083
AND I'M GONNA DRAW HER BLOOD
IN A FEW MINUTES.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.750
YOU NEED TO EAT.
I CAN'T.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.041
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

16:41.083 --> 16:44.041
SHE FINDS THE PERFECT GUY,
SHE'S GOT A GREAT MARRIAGE,

16:44.083 --> 16:46.500
THEY WANT KIDS...
SHE WAS LIVING THE DREAM.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.041
NOT EVERYBODY
HAS THAT DREAM.

16:48.083 --> 16:51.041
VIOLET DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN CHILDREN.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.375
SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THEY EXIST
BECAUSE THEY SCREAM

16:53.417 --> 16:55.583
IN HER RESTAURANTS,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.083
I USED TO BE LIKE THAT
BEFORE I HAD MAYA.
OH--

16:58.125 --> 17:00.166
I WAS, AND THEN I HAD HER,

17:00.208 --> 17:02.125
AND--I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A DREAM--

17:02.166 --> 17:04.166
BUT IT'S--
IT'S PRETTY DARN CLOSE.

17:04.208 --> 17:05.959
YOU REALLY
DON'T WANT CHILDREN?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
LOOK, NOT EVERYBODY
IS CUT OUT FOR IT.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.625
AND IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD

17:09.667 --> 17:12.041
FOR A WOMAN TO ADMIT
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT KIDS.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.166
'CAUSE THEY'RE BASICALLY
ADMITTING THEY'RE MEN.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.041
OH, OKAY, NO. JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE APPARENTLY MOVED IN...

17:17.083 --> 17:19.250
(laughs)
IT'S NOT A DISEASE,
YOU KNOW?

17:19.291 --> 17:21.750
A WOMAN CAN BE ALONE
AND BE FULFILLED, VERY.

17:21.792 --> 17:24.041
TRY SAYING THAT
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.
WOW.

17:24.083 --> 17:27.625
WHY ISN'T SHE SLEEPING?
PETE'S WORKING ON IT.
EXCUSE ME.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.000
UH, ANGIE'S SET UP
IN EXAM ROOM TWO.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.000
UH, THE SULLIVANS,
FROM YESTERDAY,

17:32.041 --> 17:34.000
THEY'RE--THEY'RE BACK
AND THEY'RE VERY ANGRY.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.709
I ASKED YOU TO WAIT.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.250
HE DID
THE RIGHT THING, SAM.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.083
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

17:45.083 --> 17:46.291
(Sam) EXCUSE ME.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.041
THERE'S A SOCIAL WORKER
IN OUR HOME.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.041
HE CALLED A SOCIAL WORKER
ON ME.

17:52.083 --> 17:55.041
ONCE I SUSPECT, LEGALLY, I HAVE
TO CALL THE AUTHORITIES.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.041
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.667
(Marilyn)
WHAT DOES HE THINK,

17:58.709 --> 18:01.625
THE HANDICAPPED WOMAN BEATS
HER DAUGHTER WITH A CANE?

18:01.667 --> 18:05.000
I-I THINK HE WAS JUST WORRIED
A-ABOUT THE NATURE

18:05.041 --> 18:06.834
OF TESS' INJURY.

18:06.875 --> 18:09.208
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T FALL
OFF A CURB.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.041
I HELP MY MOM WHEN SHE HAS
A FLARE, ALL RIGHT?

18:12.083 --> 18:15.041
SHE FELL DOWN, SHE GRABBED
MY ARM, AND IT GOT TWEAKED.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.709
I FELL. I REACHED OUT
AND I GRABBED TESS' ARM.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.041
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.834
BECAUSE...

18:22.875 --> 18:25.083
PEOPLE LIKE DR. FREEDMAN
GET THE WRONG IDEA.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.083
HAS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE,
PEOPLE GETTING THE WRONG IDEA?

18:27.125 --> 18:29.041
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF INJURIES.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.041
SHE HAS M.S.
SHE FALLS. STUFF HAPPENS.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.125
BUT MY MOM WOULD NEVER HURT ME
ON PURPOSE. SHE WOULDN'T.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.041
(Marilyn)
SHE'S MY WHOLE WORLD.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.959
I WOULD NEVER HURT HER,
NOT ON PURPOSE.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.250
PLEASE BELIEVE ME, SAM.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.041
SHE'S MY GIRL. IF THEY
TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME...

18:44.083 --> 18:45.667
I BELIEVE YOU.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.166
IF THEY
TAKE ME AWAY FROM HER,

18:48.208 --> 18:51.166
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU,
NOT EVER.

18:53.709 --> 18:56.125
I LIKE THE NAME MARGARET
FOR A GIRL.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.250
WE COULD CALL HER MAGGIE

18:59.291 --> 19:01.041
OR MEG.

19:01.083 --> 19:04.041
OR HENRY FOR A BOY.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.041
(chuckles)

19:05.083 --> 19:07.083
ANGIE, IF THE TESTS
COME BACK POSITIVE,

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
YOU'LL NEED TO TELL RAY.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.041
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

19:11.083 --> 19:13.250
NO.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.834
BUT YOU WANT THEM.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.500
I DO.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.000
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
OF BABY NAMES?

19:23.250 --> 19:26.041
CARSON...

19:26.083 --> 19:28.542
IT WORKS FOR A BOY
OR A GIRL.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.208
(chuckles)

19:30.250 --> 19:33.041
HEY.
HEY.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.500
DON'T PISS DELL OFF.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.500
HE WAS WEIGHING IN
ON A CASE.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.500
I CALL THAT
OVERSTEPPING HIS BOUNDS.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.542
I NEED HIM HERE
TO KEEP THIS PLACE RUNNING.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.333
IS THAT ALL
YOU NEED HIM FOR?
WHAT, YOU HEARD
I WENT ON A DATE,

19:43.375 --> 19:46.041
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT OUT ON DELL?

19:46.083 --> 19:49.333
NO, BUT YOU GUYS GOT
SOME KIND OF A THING GOING.
THERE'S NO "THING."

19:49.375 --> 19:52.834
DO I LIKE THAT A CUTE BOY
THINKS I'M PRETTY? YES.

19:52.875 --> 19:56.041
COULD I EVER
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY? NO.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.333
HE'S A CHILD, SAM.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.041
JUST... LEAVE IT ALONE.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.041
ALL RIGHT.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.208
(sighs)

20:07.458 --> 20:09.041
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN THERE,

20:09.083 --> 20:10.417
ADMINISTERING
YOUR HEALING TOUCH?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.417
SHUSH.
IT MIGHT BE ASLEEP.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.959
IT?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.959
(laughs) OH.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.166
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU,

20:17.208 --> 20:18.959
SEEING ME TORTURED?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.083
MM, IT IS SATISFYING.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.875
(clears throat)

20:23.917 --> 20:26.625
HEY, WHY DID YOU COME
TO MY HOUSE THE OTHER NIGHT?

20:26.667 --> 20:29.166
REALLY?
I THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE FUN.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.166
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR FUN.
I'M LOOKING FOR...

20:31.208 --> 20:33.917
SAM TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
THE MARRYING KIND OF WOMAN.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.083
I AM.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.875
I'VE BEEN MARRIED.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.083
I DON'T PLAN ON EVER
GOING DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.000
SO IF YOU WANT FUN,
I'M HERE.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.083
IF YOU WANT MORE--

20:44.125 --> 20:47.000
I SHOULD... LOOK ELSEWHERE.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.250
ADDISON--

20:48.291 --> 20:50.291
(Charlotte) IT'S NOT WORKING!
I'M NOT SLEEPING!

20:52.083 --> 20:55.125
(lowered voice)
AND STILL SATISFYING.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.125
GO.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.875
MAKE IT SLEEP.

21:12.750 --> 21:16.041
OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL BE EXPECTED
TO TESTIFY, DR. FREEDMAN.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.041
NOW TOMORROW IS THE HEARING.

21:18.083 --> 21:21.041
THAT'S FAST.
WE MOVE FAST. WE HAVE TO.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.542
NOW IF THE JUDGE DECIDES IT'S
AN UNSAFE HOME ENVIRONMENT,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.542
THE GIRL WOULD BE TAKEN
IMMEDIATELY INTO FOSTER CARE.

21:25.583 --> 21:28.458
WHAT ABOUT THE MOTHER?
WHAT ABOUT HER?

21:28.500 --> 21:31.166
WELL, IF TESS GETS TAKEN AWAY,
MARILYN SHOULDN'T BE LEFT ALONE.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.041
SHE HAS M.S.
THAT'S NOT
OUR DEPARTMENT'S CONCERN.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.041
OUR CONCERN IS THE CHILD.
I SHOULD SAY, UM,

21:36.083 --> 21:38.125
TESS IS PRETTY INSISTENT
THAT THERE'S NO ABUSE.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.125
WELL, THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL.
THE CHILD PROTECTS THE PARENT,

21:40.166 --> 21:42.041
EVEN RATIONALIZES
THE BEHAVIOR.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.166
AND WHAT IF TESS
IS TELLING THE TRUTH?
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A JUDGE.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.375
BUT THE MEDICAL TESTIMONY
CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT,

21:47.417 --> 21:51.000
AND I'M SURE DR. FREEDMAN
DID NOT MAKE THIS CALL LIGHTLY.

21:56.083 --> 21:59.667
ANGIE, THIS IS, UH,
DR. VIOLET TURNER.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.041
SHE'S OUR PSYCHIATRIST.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.458
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
GONNA TELL ME MY TEST RESULTS.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.000
OH.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.083
OHH.

22:17.125 --> 22:19.709
I HAVE IT.

22:19.750 --> 22:23.000
I REALLY HAVE IT.

22:23.041 --> 22:26.208
BUT AS OF NOW,
YOU HAVE NO SYMPTOMS.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.000
YOU COULD GO YEARS

22:28.041 --> 22:30.041
BEFORE YOU SHOW
ANY SIGN OF ILLNESS.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.625
ILLNESS?

22:31.667 --> 22:34.959
YOU MEAN DEMENTIA,
VIOLENT RAGES,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.458
WETTING MYSELF?

22:36.500 --> 22:38.834
A LOT OF RESEARCH THEY'RE DOING
WITH REPRESSION PROTEINS

22:38.875 --> 22:41.250
IS VERY PROMISING.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.959
HOPEFULLY, IN TIME--
OH, I DON'T HAVE TIME,
DR. BENNETT.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.792
TIME IS THE ONE THING
I DON'T HAVE.

22:45.834 --> 22:48.250
I'VE GOT A GREAT LIFE,
AN AMAZING HUSBAND,

22:48.291 --> 22:50.208
BUT NO TIME.

22:50.250 --> 22:53.250
DAMN IT.
I AM SO OUT OF TIME.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.875
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT
TO PROCESS.

22:58.917 --> 23:00.500
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

23:00.542 --> 23:02.166
YOU HAVE RAY.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.166
NO.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.583
NO, I KNEW
WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO

23:05.625 --> 23:07.125
WHEN I TOOK THAT TEST--

23:07.166 --> 23:08.709
THAT STUPID, STUPID TEST.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.583
(Naomi) ANGIE--
WHY DON'T YOU STAY?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.250
WE CAN TALK.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.041
I CAN'T,
BUT THANK YOU,

23:15.083 --> 23:17.875
ALL OF YOU,
FOR TRYING TO HELP.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.041
WELL, WHAT ABOUT RAY?
WHAT DO YOU--

23:20.083 --> 23:23.083
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

23:25.750 --> 23:26.375
I'M BEGGING YOU.

23:26.417 --> 23:29.667
OH, NO.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.667
I HAVE TRIED ACUPUNCTURE,
MASSAGE, PRESSURE POINTS,

23:31.709 --> 23:34.250
MELATONIN SUPPLEMENTS,
AROMATHERAPY, SOUND THERAPY.

23:34.291 --> 23:36.250
AND I CAN TELL
IT'S NOT WORKING

23:36.291 --> 23:37.208
BECAUSE SHE'S STILL
BITCHING AT ME.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.917
CHARLOTTE NEEDS A SHRINK.

23:39.959 --> 23:42.041
YEAH, AGREED,
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, BUT--

23:42.083 --> 23:44.041
SQUEEZE HER IN.
I--

23:44.083 --> 23:47.041
THIS IS CO-OP MEDICINE,
AND I'M REFERRING.

23:47.083 --> 23:50.000
YOU NEED TO CO-OP.
NOW.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.041
90% OF SLEEP ISSUES
ARE PSYCHOLOGICAL.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.458
FINE. SHRINK AWAY.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.041
WHEN YOU SLEEP,
DO YOU TOSS AND TURN,

24:01.083 --> 24:02.250
THRASH AROUND A LOT?

24:02.291 --> 24:05.041
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
I'M ASLEEP.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.625
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

24:06.667 --> 24:09.041
WELL, THAT--THAT'S WHERE
A PARTNER COULD BE HELPFUL.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.333
UH, THE LAST TIME
YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE--

24:11.375 --> 24:13.750
WAS YEARS AGO.

24:13.792 --> 24:16.166
SO YOU HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN--

24:16.208 --> 24:18.166
I HAVE SEX.
THEY JUST DON'T SLEEP OVER.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.917
EVER?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.125
ARE YOU ASKING BECAUSE YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN MY WELL-BEING,

24:22.166 --> 24:24.709
OR BECAUSE YOU'RE SECRETLY
THRILLED TO FIND SOMEONE

24:24.750 --> 24:26.709
WHO'S AS ALONE AS YOU ARE?

24:26.750 --> 24:28.709
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
A CHILD? I'M FINE.

24:28.750 --> 24:31.000
I AM BETTER THAN FINE,
IN FACT. I...

24:34.333 --> 24:36.375
LET'S JUST STAY ON YOU.

24:36.417 --> 24:38.041
(elevator bell dings)

24:38.083 --> 24:39.375
DR. MONTGOMERY.

24:39.417 --> 24:42.458
HEY, RAY. HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S ANGIE?

24:42.500 --> 24:45.375
GONE. SHE'S GONE.
ANGIE LEFT ME.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.041
I CAME HOME,

24:47.083 --> 24:49.041
AND I FOUND HER
PACKING A SUITCASE,

24:49.083 --> 24:52.959
AND... SHE SAID
THAT HER APPOINTMENT HERE

24:53.000 --> 24:55.375
WAS LIKE
SOME KIND OF WAKE-UP CALL,

24:55.417 --> 24:58.917
AND THEN SHE JUST LEFT.

24:58.959 --> 25:01.792
AND THAT'S ALL SHE SAID?
(cries)

25:01.834 --> 25:04.917
HERE, UH, RAY,
WHY--WHY DON'T YOU--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:04.959 --> 25:06.917
SHE SPENDS TWO MINUTES
WITH THE TWO OF YOU,

25:06.959 --> 25:08.834
AND THEN THROWS IN
THE TOWEL ON OUR MARRIAGE?
RAY, PLEASE CALM DOWN.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.917
NO, I WANT TO KNOW.

25:10.959 --> 25:14.000
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU SAY TO MY WIFE?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.333
IT SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS
IN HERE.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.041
IT'S AN AYURVEDIC
SLEEP REMEDY

25:22.083 --> 25:23.750
THAT MIGHT
KNOCK CHARLOTTE OUT.

25:23.792 --> 25:26.041
WHAT DID YOU GET?

25:26.083 --> 25:27.417
INTIMACY ISSUES,
SEVERE.

25:27.458 --> 25:30.583
SHE TRIES TO ALIENATE
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT GET CLOSE,

25:30.625 --> 25:32.750
EVEN PEOPLE
SHE ASKS FOR HELP.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.041
SLEEP'S TRIGGERED

25:34.083 --> 25:36.041
WHEN YOU COMFORT YOURSELF
INTO A SELF-SEDATED STATE.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.667
AND PEOPLE LIKE CHARLOTTE--

25:38.709 --> 25:41.417
CHANCES ARE NOBODY EVER
REALLY NURTURED HER,

25:41.458 --> 25:43.417
TAUGHT HER
HOW TO SELF-SOOTHE.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.125
NURTURE HER, PETE.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.375
BE KIND.

25:47.417 --> 25:50.000
I...

25:50.041 --> 25:53.125
(sighs) PEOPLE HAVE BABIES
IN THIS BED?

25:53.166 --> 25:55.417
WE CHANGE THE SHEETS.
PROMISE.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.291
GO AHEAD AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.
RELAX.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.250
YOU'RE SMILING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.041
I'M STAYING POSITIVE.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.208
(sighs) OH, BROTHER.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.583
PEOPLE NEED CONNECTION
TO STAY HEALTHY,

26:15.625 --> 26:18.041
POSITIVE CONNECTION
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN--

26:18.083 --> 26:19.250
LOOK, I DON'T...

26:19.291 --> 26:22.417
I DON'T NEED
YOUR PITY POSITIVITY.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.417
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT VIOLET TOLD YOU,

26:24.458 --> 26:26.291
BUT I CONNECT, OKAY?

26:26.333 --> 26:28.083
YEAH, WHEN?

26:28.125 --> 26:29.625
NONE OF YOUR BUS--

26:29.667 --> 26:31.125
BUSINESS, RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:31.166 --> 26:34.125
MAYBE... I--I'M NOT
THE GUY TO HELP YOU.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.834
MAYBE YOU NEED SOMEONE--

26:35.875 --> 26:38.959
WHO I CAN'T IRRITATE.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.250
FIND THAT MAN FOR ME,
AND I'LL MARRY HIM.

26:44.583 --> 26:48.500
MY FAMILY DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN DISPLAYS.

26:48.542 --> 26:51.125
OF AFFECTION?

26:51.166 --> 26:53.208
(sighs)

26:53.250 --> 26:55.041
MY MOTHER...

26:55.083 --> 26:58.041
THERE WAS THE OCCASIONAL
SLOPPY KIND

26:58.083 --> 27:00.041
THAT FOLLOWED COCKTAILS.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.792
AND SINCE THEN?

27:04.291 --> 27:08.041
WHO HAS TIME
FOR THAT KIND OF THING?

27:08.083 --> 27:10.000
I'M SORRY, CHARLOTTE.

27:14.959 --> 27:17.458
DO YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.792
WHY NOT?

27:19.834 --> 27:22.583
MY HAIR'S ALREADY SHOT.

27:29.041 --> 27:31.250
CAN YOU DROP THESE
AT THE LAB FOR ME?

27:31.291 --> 27:33.667
YEAH.
(Cooper) THANKS.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.291
UM, AHEM, MARILYN SULLIVAN
CALLED FOR YOU AGAIN.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.000
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO HER
UNTIL AFTER THE HEARING.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.208
DON'T START, MAN.

27:40.250 --> 27:43.041
THERE'S NOTHING VAGUE
ABOUT THE LAW.

27:43.083 --> 27:45.291
I SUSPECT AND--
TESS WEARS LONG SLEEVES
A LOT.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.291
WHAT?

27:47.333 --> 27:50.041
WELL, EVEN WHEN IT'S,
LIKE, 95 DEGREES OUTSIDE,

27:50.083 --> 27:51.709
DOWN OVER HER HANDS.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.959
AND DOES SHE EVER LOOK AT YOU,
I MEAN, LIKE,

27:54.000 --> 27:55.792
REALLY LOOK YOU IN THE EYE?
NOT REALLY, NO.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.333
RIGHT. WHEN SHE HAS
APPOINTMENTS WITHOUT HER MOM,

27:57.375 --> 27:59.542
SHE SHOWS UP EARLY,
SHE HANGS OUT AFTER,

27:59.583 --> 28:01.625
LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO HOME.
I'VE SEEN THAT.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.709
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.709
UH, BECAUSE I DID
THE SAME THING

28:05.750 --> 28:07.709
WHEN I WAS
IN HER SITUATION.

28:07.750 --> 28:10.250
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

28:10.291 --> 28:13.250
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET THE LAB
RIGHT ON THIS.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.250
THANKS.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.417
FASCINATING.

28:20.458 --> 28:22.875
SHE'S BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?

28:22.917 --> 28:24.208
SHE SNORES?

28:24.250 --> 28:27.041
GOD, ASLEEP,
SHE LOOKS ALMOST HARMLESS.

28:27.083 --> 28:30.208
MM, LIKE A SLEEPING TIGER.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.041
SHH.
DON'T WAKE THE TIGER.

28:33.375 --> 28:35.667
I HAVE TO GO, UM,
AND PUT MY TIE ON

28:35.709 --> 28:38.291
FOR TESS' HEARING.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.709
HE NEEDS YOU.

28:50.125 --> 28:52.000
HE PUT HER TO SLEEP.

28:52.041 --> 28:53.083
OH.

28:53.125 --> 28:55.041
HE ACTUALLY DID IT.
(laughs) YEP.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.792
ANGIE'S HERE.

28:56.834 --> 28:58.792
SHE FINALLY RESPONDED
TO OUR PHONE MESSAGES.

28:58.834 --> 29:01.291
WELL, WE GOT HER TO COME BACK.
THAT'S SOMETHING.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.667
ANY IDEAS
ON WHAT WE SAY TO HER?

29:03.709 --> 29:05.041
NO.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.041
YOU SAID THE BABY MAKING GAME
WOULD BE FUN.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.166
I AM NOT HAVING FUN.

29:09.208 --> 29:12.041
OH, GOD. ME NEITHER.
NOT WITH THIS ONE.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.500
MM, IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT FAIR.

29:15.542 --> 29:19.041
GOOD PEOPLE SHOULD GET
TO HAVE WHAT THEY WANT.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.041
I WAS HEADING TO THE AIRPORT.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.083
YOU SAID THERE WAS
SOMETHING WITH RAY?

29:23.125 --> 29:25.083
RAY CAME BY TO SEE US
YESTERDAY.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.291
HE WAS WORRIED SICK
ABOUT YOU,

29:27.333 --> 29:29.291
NOT TO MENTION CONFUSED
AND HURT.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.041
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM, DID YOU?
YOU CANNOT TELL HIM.

29:32.083 --> 29:35.291
ANGIE, HE IS YOUR HUSBAND.
HE DESERVES TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

29:35.333 --> 29:38.917
(sighs) LET HIM THINK
I LEFT HIM.

29:38.959 --> 29:40.333
LET HIM HATE ME.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.083
THEN HE CAN MOVE ON,

29:42.125 --> 29:45.083
FIND SOMEONE, BE HAPPY.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.041
HE'S HAPPY WITH YOU.

29:47.083 --> 29:50.291
BUT... HE'S GONNA...

29:50.333 --> 29:53.041
I'M GONNA GET SO SICK.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.542
I'M GONNA DIE.

29:55.583 --> 29:57.083
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.458
ANGIE...

29:59.500 --> 30:01.500
YOU HAVE A DISEASE.

30:01.542 --> 30:05.041
