00:49.500 --> 00:52.300
<i>A man is born into a civilized world...</i>

00:52.300 --> 00:57.700
<i>and that is all a mask that
hides him from who he really is...</i>

00:59.300 --> 01:01.400
...animals.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.500
<i>Fucking hunters and killers.</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:07.500
<i>That's what nature
designed you to be.</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:09.700
<i>For the next 45 minutes...</i>

01:09.700 --> 01:13.800
<i>you have got to be your
perfect animal selves.</i>

01:18.500 --> 01:20.800
<i>This isn't a fucking game.</i>

01:20.800 --> 01:23.700
<i>This is life.</i>

01:23.700 --> 01:26.400
<i>It isn't about win or lose...</i>

01:26.400 --> 01:29.300
<i>it's about live or die.</i>

01:43.800 --> 01:45.800
- Congratulations, Coach.
- Thank you.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.200
All right, all right.

01:49.200 --> 01:53.200
You guys did it. Come on now,
you're a team, you did it.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.900
Oh, my God, I can hardly
wait to get home.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.500
What?

02:09.500 --> 02:11.600
I'm glad you made it.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.500
I know you're always
busy with work.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.600
Mom and Dad's anniversary?
Of course, I'd be here.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.300
You know, I didn't forget
as bad as you think.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.600
I was gonna get you flowers...

02:19.600 --> 02:20.700
but they're not permitted
on the plane...

02:20.700 --> 02:23.100
so I got you this instead.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.300
Well, go ahead... smell them.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.400
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.700
Is it true what they say?

02:45.700 --> 02:48.200
That Dad has a policy?

02:48.200 --> 02:49.800
The policy?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.700
Abstinence.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.500
Eva, you're an adult now.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.300
Just say you want to know
if they can fuck. Ssh.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.400
Come on, just say it
with me... fuck.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.100
I can't.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.500
Then how does Dad enforce
something like that?

03:08.700 --> 03:11.300
Poorly.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.600
You didn't.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.500
Hey, I don't play soccer.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.700
Wait, hold on, so you're saying
that you just don't believe in condoms?

03:18.700 --> 03:20.200
Wait, I don't get it.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.600
I'm not fucking delusional,
that's not what I said.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.800
I don't use Trojans,
it's a principle.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
Why?

03:26.800 --> 03:31.800
Historical fact, Greeks are
notorious for penetrating Trojan defenses.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.000
Oh, my God.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.600
Hey, you're Greek,
do you agree with your brother?

03:36.600 --> 03:39.900
I am Greek,
but I'm not stupid.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.300
Just relax. Stay cool.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.899
Wow. How many yellow cards did
you have this season?

04:19.899 --> 04:22.700
On the low.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.700
Yeah, on the low.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.700
Fucking planes, man.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.900
You know what I would
do if I were you?

04:34.900 --> 04:39.500
Close your eyes.
Seriously, close your eyes.

04:43.800 --> 04:50.800
Take a deep breath...
and take a nap.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.500
I'll wake you up as soon
as the plane hits the ground.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.900
Really?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.100
What?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.300
I gotta take a piss.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.500
You see this?
What?

05:12.500 --> 05:14.300
There's an article on the team.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.500
I know, I read it.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.100
What the fuck, right?

05:19.100 --> 05:20.700
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.600
Well, they only profiled
Felix and Slim.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.800
Felix leads the league in saves.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
Yeah, then Slim?

05:29.800 --> 05:32.100
Slim scored the clincher
against the Turks.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.000
They credited me the assist, no?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.800
It's a fucking assist? It was
a shot on goal. It was your...

05:37.800 --> 05:41.400
It just didn't matter.
That's your captain.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
It's bullshit...
and if you asked me...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.700
Nobody asked you.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.200
Hey.
Hey.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.900
How are you holding up?

06:26.800 --> 06:30.100
It's less dangerous
than a highway.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.100
You say that every time,
but somehow it never makes it easier.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.500
I've got an idea.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
Your dad is like 30 feet away.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.200
I know... I love how much he
terrifies you.

06:42.700 --> 06:46.000
Well, if your nerves are still
getting the best of you...

06:46.000 --> 06:51.200
in an hour,
we are at mile high.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.800
I'll keep that in mind.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
You should.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.600
Keep what in mind?

07:05.600 --> 07:06.800
Nothing.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.700
Nothing.
Nope.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.700
Hey, you think you'll make it?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.900
What?
Practice Monday.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.700
You gonna make it?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.800
Yeah, I'll keep the bench warm.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.800
You good?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.600
Yeah.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.900
Man, you don't look good.
Come on, have a seat.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.900
What are these?

07:56.900 --> 07:58.700
Well, you don't like flying.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.400
These make you like flying.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.200
I thought you were a trainer,
not a pharmacist.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.400
Thanks.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
Sleep tight.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.900
<i>The captain has turned on
the seat belt sign.</i>

08:36.000 --> 08:39.299
<i>Please return to your seats
and fasten...</i>

09:30.200 --> 09:32.000
Somebody help!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.100
Eva!

09:55.100 --> 09:56.400
Breathe!

09:56.400 --> 09:58.300
Breathe!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.900
You got her!

10:05.900 --> 10:07.800
He's got you!
I got him!

11:30.600 --> 11:33.000
Hey, Connie.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.200
That's 22 dead so far.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.700
Is Sevy gonna make it?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.500
I'm just a trainer.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.200
He needs a hospital,
he needs real doctors.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.700
You okay?

12:03.800 --> 12:06.200
Who else is alive?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
Slim.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.200
Felix.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.800
Arnie.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.400
And Markese, Patton, McKenna...

12:19.600 --> 12:23.700
my brother, Elena and Eva.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.400
Just 15 of us.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
What do we do now?

12:32.500 --> 12:35.300
I don't know.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.400
Figure out how to survive.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.500
I saw something.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
I think I saw my dad.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.900
Wait here.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.600
There's nothing down there.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.300
No fucking way.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.800
And I was just starting
to think there was no God.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.500
Whoa.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.600
That's my mother's.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.700
Sorry.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.600
Take it off, it's Buteri's.
So.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.800
So, if you don't take it off,
I'm gonna smash your neck!

14:36.800 --> 14:38.100
Relax... what?

14:38.100 --> 14:40.000
He's wearing Buteri's jersey.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.700
Hey... Buteri's gone, man.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.100
Okay.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.900
See what you can do with this.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.500
My hero.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.100
What are you doing?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.900
Check this out.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.800
It didn't even get that wet.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.500
I'll wait a while
before I try it.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.500
I'm gonna get this thing
to turn on, the GPS...

15:43.900 --> 15:48.900
I don't see any cell towers
around here.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.100
The team's not doing too good.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.000
Slim, we need a real plan here.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.100
That's no way to be a captain.
Don't fucking lecture me, all right?

16:03.100 --> 16:04.800
I didn't ask for this.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.600
Any of it.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.800
What? What!

16:10.800 --> 16:12.400
Are you all right?
I'm fine!

16:20.900 --> 16:22.700
Connie!

16:24.700 --> 16:25.900
What happened?

16:25.900 --> 16:27.000
Did you hit him?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.800
No, I didn't hit him!

16:28.800 --> 16:30.200
One second he's talking,
the next he's bleeding and on the ground!

16:30.200 --> 16:32.700
Could be some kind of
decompression sickness.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.800
Is this gonna happen to us?

16:34.800 --> 16:37.100
I don't know... maybe.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.100
But we need to stay hydrated
or it's gonna get worse.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.600
How much worse?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.100
I need you to keep
an eye on him, okay?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.600
Yeah.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.500
How about we get
the First Aid kit.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.900
How much do we have?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
Not enough.

18:27.900 --> 18:32.100
I can't bend the rules.
Not even for you, Georgie.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.500
Hey!

19:15.200 --> 19:16.500
Come on!

19:16.500 --> 19:18.200
I'm coming!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.100
This'll feed us for a week!

19:21.900 --> 19:24.600
We're gonna go look for more!
Don't move!

19:24.600 --> 19:26.500
Don't move and don't fucking
lose it!

19:26.500 --> 19:27.600
Don't be a fucking idiot!
I got it!

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
Let's go.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Kenne!
Kenne!

20:02.100 --> 20:04.400
Fuck is he going?
What the fuck, Kenne!

20:10.000 --> 20:13.300
No, no, no, no!
Fuck.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.200
All right, listen to me, okay?
I didn't just drop the food.
There was a shark out there!

20:22.200 --> 20:23.900
What shark?
There is, dude, I left...

20:23.900 --> 20:25.300
That's bullshit, Arnie!
Take it easy, man!

20:25.300 --> 20:28.200
He's got a fucking pussy!
Hey!

20:28.200 --> 20:29.400
Wait a minute!

20:35.200 --> 20:36.400
Get the fuck off me!

20:36.400 --> 20:38.600
Control yourself.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.300
Kenne says he saw a shark.
I did see a shark!

20:46.400 --> 20:49.000
Oh, fucking bullshit!
He didn't see a fucking shark!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.600
He got scared,
now he's making up excuses.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.100
Ask him what he did
with the food.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.400
What food?

20:53.400 --> 20:56.400
We emptied a meal cart,
two bags full.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.500
Now the current's just carried
them out to sea.

20:59.500 --> 21:05.600
I could barely swim, and there was a shark,
so I had to get away.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.200
But I can make that up.
You're gonna make it up!

21:09.200 --> 21:11.600
No more food or water
for the rest of the day.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.000
Whoa, man...

21:13.000 --> 21:15.100
Anyone take issue with that?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.500
The same goes for you.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.500
Me? For what?

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
Fighting.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.100
You can't fucking do that.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.200
No?

21:33.200 --> 21:36.500
This is still a team!

21:36.500 --> 21:42.400
We have to start thinking
about the group and not just ourselves.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.500
Do you believe him?

22:03.500 --> 22:08.100
Kennefick? I don't know,
I didn't see any shark.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.400
Whoa...

22:26.500 --> 22:29.600
<i>Companero! Como estas?</i>

22:31.100 --> 22:32.800
<i>Asi, asi.</i>

22:32.800 --> 22:35.500
You've been in and out
for about two days.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.800
Elena been looking after you.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.400
I'm so glad you're okay.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.200
Hey.
Back to the land of the living.

22:41.700 --> 22:46.700
Yeah? I can't tell.
I think I need some water.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.100
You may have to wait
a few hours.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.400
Rationing?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.200
Says who?

22:53.200 --> 22:56.600
My brother, he's been handling
things while you caught up on sleep.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.300
There he is!

23:01.400 --> 23:02.800
How you feeling, brother?

23:02.800 --> 23:05.000
A little light-headed.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.900
Dude, your head looked like it
was about to fucking pop.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.300
Let's talk.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.800
We're low.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.900
Real low.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.800
The food I'm not as worried
about. We can make it stretch.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.000
It's the water
I'm worried about.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.500
For what we have right now...

23:43.500 --> 23:47.400
we've got three,
maybe four days left.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.100
After that, we start
dropping like flies.

23:51.100 --> 23:54.800
So, we've just given up on the fact that
there's a rescue party looking for us right now?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.600
A rescue party
that may never find us.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
It may find us.
It may not.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.700
You're talking like
it's the end of the world.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.800
Fucking doomsday preppers
or something.

24:03.800 --> 24:10.000
Planes crash, people survive.
They get rescued... all right?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.900
Our job is to stay positive.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.500
Exactly, and there are people that are
injured that need our help surviving...

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
until help comes, all right?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.500
They need us to be optimistic.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.300
That's the other thing
I wanted to talk about.

24:28.900 --> 24:33.100
Why do I feel like I don't want to talk
about this and I don't want to hear it.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.000
Because you don't.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.400
Two injured, one is way out.

24:46.400 --> 24:51.000
People are going to start
questioning whether we're wasting rations.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Where are you with that?

24:53.100 --> 24:58.000
If it's a choice between someone who's
dying or the rest of the team...

24:58.000 --> 25:00.700
it's not much of a choice.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.100
Take Sevy.
Sevy has a broken leg, we know that.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.900
Broken and severely infected.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.800
I'm not saying we do anything,
I'm just commenting objectively.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.800
Every time he eats and drinks,
he hurts the group.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.800
That's the reality.

25:22.800 --> 25:28.700
It sounds crazy, I know,
but at some point I'm low,
and that's a fact.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.700
You do realize that we take away his water,
we'd just be letting him die, right?

25:35.700 --> 25:38.600
Then we let him.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.800
People will die...
that's not a question.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
The question is how many.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.100
Everything okay?

26:00.800 --> 26:05.200
Yeah, he was... he was just
catching me up on some stuff.

26:05.200 --> 26:09.200
So, what up, Slim?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah,<i> mis a mi.</i>

26:11.700 --> 26:13.100
Okay.

26:23.300 --> 26:24.800
Okay.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.200
How bad?

26:33.200 --> 26:38.400
I just gotta clean the wound.
I need some more water.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.200
We can't spare the water.

26:42.800 --> 26:47.100
I'm sorry, Sev, we agreed no
more until tonight.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.000
Is he serious?

26:53.800 --> 26:55.000
Use my share.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.700
I can go a night.

27:21.900 --> 27:25.900
I'm saying it's the only way
to make what we have last a little longer.

27:25.900 --> 27:29.000
Yeah, I know what you're saying,
and I'm saying that you're being fucking ridiculous.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.300
So let me get this straight,
we're talking about killing our friends.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
Keep your voices down,
they can probably hear us.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.700
No, the answer is no.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.200
It's not that simple, Connie!

27:42.200 --> 27:44.200
We're running out of water!

27:44.200 --> 27:48.000
On top of that, we're short.
Wait, we're short?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.900
How do you know?
Because I've been keeping track.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.800
There's food missing, too,
which means someone's been taking from the pile.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.800
Looks like we don't have
much of a choice now.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.300
So, cut off their food
and water?

27:59.300 --> 28:02.900
Wait, guys, who are we
talking about exactly?

28:02.900 --> 28:04.000
Sevy and Stephan.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.900
Why not add Slim to the list...

28:05.900 --> 28:08.400
or does a nose bleed
not qualify?

28:08.400 --> 28:09.800
Eva, stop!

28:09.800 --> 28:11.700
Why are we even
talking about this?

28:11.700 --> 28:15.000
Because half the people here have
already come up to me and suggested it.

28:19.900 --> 28:24.100
It's not like we have much
of a choice now.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.300
It's cruel you could let them
live this long, these guys are suffering.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.900
They should die in peace.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.900
Wow, how noble of you.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.300
Yeah, they're real lucky
to have you on their side.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.300
And you do remember
saving Sevy, don't you?

28:35.300 --> 28:38.200
If I knew you guys were gonna
put this forward...

28:38.200 --> 28:40.200
I wouldn't have wasted my time
taking care of them.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.900
Hey, remember you weren't
breathing, but I brought you back to life?

28:44.900 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, that was just so
we could starve you to death.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.500
I'm not doing this.

28:48.500 --> 28:52.500
Put it to a vote.

28:52.500 --> 28:58.200
It's the only way to do it,
right? Everyone gets a voice.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.300
I'll go first.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.200
I vote we cut them off.
I agree.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.300
Of course, yes.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.600
Yes.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.000
No.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.900
Yes.
Absolutely not.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.900
No.
Yes.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.200
Okay.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.500
Eva?

29:16.500 --> 29:18.400
No.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.600
That's even.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.200
It's on you, Slim.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.400
Yes.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.100
That's that.

30:11.500 --> 30:15.400
Hey... mind if I sit?

30:17.100 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.900
What's that?

30:28.900 --> 30:32.500
My dad gave them to my mom
when she was pregnant.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.600
They survived the wreck.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.200
Can you believe that?

30:53.100 --> 30:54.800
Don't.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.800
It doesn't feel right.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.100
It's gonna be okay.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.400
It's gonna be okay.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.800
It's just a dream.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.300
You're going to go home
real soon.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.800
You promise?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.800
Stephan's dead.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.500
What?

34:30.600 --> 34:33.000
How did we not see this before?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.600
There could be food, water
there, right?

34:38.600 --> 34:40.000
How far is it?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I'd say about a mile.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.800
Yeah, I agree.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.000
I'll take Markese,
Arnie and Elena.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.500
Why Elena?

34:48.500 --> 34:50.699
The channel's a mile long,
she's the best swimmer.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.100
Why aren't you taking me?

34:53.100 --> 34:55.800
Two days ago you were
damn near in a coma.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.600
Your body shuts down
again on the way over...

34:57.600 --> 34:59.200
Okay, understood.

34:59.200 --> 35:05.900
Besides, I don't trust the
others alone with the rations.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
What about me?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.600
If something goes wrong
and we don't make it back...

35:11.600 --> 35:14.600
I need you to back Slim.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.800
We split up all the time
in practice, right?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.200
Just think of it as a scrimmage.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.900
In a scrimmage,
we take turns, yeah?

35:31.300 --> 35:32.900
Hey, I just thought
of something.

35:32.900 --> 35:36.000
Dude, you were the one that said Kenne
was full of shit to begin with.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.600
I know, I'm saying, "What if?"

35:51.300 --> 35:52.600
Don't!

35:53.800 --> 35:55.600
You scared me.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.200
A tree that bleeds.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.900
It's not blood.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.900
What is it?

36:30.200 --> 36:32.200
That's resin.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.800
Resin.

37:48.300 --> 37:52.000
Please let there be food
here! God!

37:57.200 --> 37:58.400
And this island is just
more of the same.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.900
There's nothing here, either.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.300
We can make rope out of this.

38:17.900 --> 38:22.500
There's enough here to make
nets... traps if we need to.

38:24.400 --> 38:29.100
Wow... you didn't strike me
as the Boy Scout.

38:29.100 --> 38:33.500
Eagle Scout... actually.

38:33.500 --> 38:37.500
You're swooning.
I know, it happens.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.600
Hey.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.600
What are you doing?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.300
Oh, I'm just keeping
an eye out.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.200
Have you seen Connie?

39:14.200 --> 39:17.000
He, uh, took off up a trail.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.100
All right.

39:19.100 --> 39:21.300
I'll be back.
Watch the stuff, yeah?

39:21.300 --> 39:22.900
Okay.

39:51.300 --> 39:54.100
Are you afraid of heights?
Mm-mm.

39:54.100 --> 39:58.500
I'm not afraid...
I just don't like them.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.500
You know, as much
as I try to fight it...

40:08.500 --> 40:12.800
I can't help but think that...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.700
this is it.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.400
No one's coming.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.100
You know, I'm not afraid
I'll never leave.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.600
I'm afraid when this is all
over, I won't want to.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.200
See these berries?

40:42.200 --> 40:45.300
They're all over this island.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.500
Just can't eat 'em.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.100
Poison.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.600
Nothing lives on this island.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.700
It's just a matter of time.

41:14.100 --> 41:18.800
The idea I am here...
is not yet present.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.600
I think it's a nightmare.

41:28.300 --> 41:34.400
I think some moment...
I'm gonna still wake up.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.500
Yeah.

41:46.100 --> 41:52.300
Well, if you do, be sure
and wake me up, too.

41:53.900 --> 41:56.100
Sleep tight.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.400
Oh, no, no, no!
Connie!

42:23.800 --> 42:26.200
Movies on an island.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.600
Uh, Castaway?

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
Uh, The Beach.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.700
Pirates of the Caribbean?

42:33.700 --> 42:35.900
Okay, sort of.
Yeah, yeah.

42:35.900 --> 42:39.500
Uh... The Beach.
Did I say that?

42:39.500 --> 42:40.600
Yeah, I think you did.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.600
Uh, The Island.
Whoa! Doug!

42:47.400 --> 42:49.800
Doug!

42:49.800 --> 42:51.400
Jesus!

42:59.600 --> 43:02.900
Doug? Doug! Doug.
Jesus!

43:03.000 --> 43:05.600
Look at me and just
calm down, don't move.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.300
I got you.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.500
Georgie.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.700
What?

43:14.700 --> 43:16.700
Georgie.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.800
Looks like we're not
the first ones here.

43:23.900 --> 43:26.000
Focus on me.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.000
Don't look at it, I got you.

43:36.500 --> 43:40.000
How come I look like his and you
don't have a scratch on you?

43:53.900 --> 43:55.800
Georgie!
Agh!

43:57.600 --> 43:59.500
Find Connie!
Go now!

43:59.500 --> 44:00.800
Connie!

44:03.900 --> 44:05.700
Connie!

44:08.500 --> 44:10.400
Connie!

45:03.700 --> 45:06.300
The question...

45:09.900 --> 45:13.900
I think with everything
that's happened today...

45:13.900 --> 45:17.400
some people might feel
differently about the food rationing.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.100
I thinking we should
put it to another vote.

45:21.100 --> 45:24.000
There's not gonna be
another vote.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.300
We voted...
a decision was made.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.700
We're sticking with it.

45:46.200 --> 45:49.300
Shit.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.400
Why do you think it'll work.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.400
Slim!

48:08.900 --> 48:13.100
Eva had an idea... might help
our water situation.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.900
I think we can use the raft
to make a condensation rig.

48:17.900 --> 48:21.100
If we find a way
to suspend it at an angle...

48:21.100 --> 48:24.500
we could create a water trap.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.400
What's going on?

48:26.400 --> 48:28.200
Will that really work?

48:28.200 --> 48:31.200
Yeah, it should.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.400
Well, what are we talking about?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.500
You ever done it before?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.600
Personally, no.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.800
Hello? Am I invisible?

48:38.800 --> 48:41.400
We'd have to cut the raft.
Cut the raft?

48:41.400 --> 48:42.900
Are you fucking insane?

48:42.900 --> 48:44.800
It's not yours to cut up.
Who says it's yours?

48:44.800 --> 48:46.400
I saved it.
And I saved most of the food.

48:46.400 --> 48:51.600
Hey, listen, we're talking about
destroying our only way off this island.

48:51.700 --> 48:57.200
Slim, man, listen, please, we're
almost out of food and water...

48:57.200 --> 49:00.500
and this raft,
it's our only hope.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.100
And even if by some miracle
she manages to make this thing work...

49:03.100 --> 49:06.500
maybe some of us don't like the idea of
spending the rest of our lives on this island.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.600
Isn't Connie proof of that?

49:08.600 --> 49:11.000
Nobody's cutting this raft up.
Since when do you have a say?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.300
Since when the fuck do you?

49:14.400 --> 49:17.300
Hey! Felix, please?

49:22.600 --> 49:25.500
Make the rig... okay?

51:57.200 --> 52:00.300
Guys! Doug and McKenna
are leaving with the raft!

52:00.300 --> 52:02.000
Guys, come on!
Hey! Hey!

52:02.000 --> 52:05.300
Guys! The raft! Come on!

52:05.300 --> 52:08.600
Felix! Hey!

52:09.900 --> 52:11.900
Come on! Row! Row! Row!

52:23.400 --> 52:24.600
Get him off!

52:28.600 --> 52:30.700
Oh, shit!

52:30.700 --> 52:32.400
He's got my paddle!

52:37.700 --> 52:39.000
Get the fuck out of here!

52:45.500 --> 52:47.300
Go, go, row, row!

53:03.500 --> 53:05.300
What happened?

53:05.300 --> 53:07.300
Are you fucking serious?

53:07.300 --> 53:08.400
Where were you, huh?

53:08.400 --> 53:09.900
Taking a piss.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.700
Why do they have the boat?

53:13.700 --> 53:16.300
It's my fault.

53:16.300 --> 53:20.100
I told Eva she could cut the
raft and they freaked.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.700
I should have saw it coming.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.500
So them acting weird
didn't raise a red flag?

53:26.500 --> 53:28.700
Didn't I fucking
just say it was my fault?

53:29.600 --> 53:31.400
I'm sure you
hammering home the idea...

53:31.400 --> 53:34.400
we'd never gonna get off this
island, didn't help, either.

53:36.700 --> 53:38.900
What are we gonna do now?

54:28.600 --> 54:30.500
Can I see that?

55:14.700 --> 55:18.600
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

55:22.600 --> 55:26.800
Taking a shit... that okay?

55:39.300 --> 55:41.100
What the hell?

55:43.300 --> 55:46.200
What a fucking piece of shit!

55:46.200 --> 55:49.100
Doug! Get Kennefick!
He's stealing!

55:49.100 --> 55:52.000
Get him! Grab him! Doug!

56:06.100 --> 56:07.900
You fucking pussy, Kenne!

56:19.100 --> 56:21.300
Where the fuck are you, Kenne?

56:23.300 --> 56:27.200
Kenne!
Where the fuck is he?

56:27.200 --> 56:28.300
Kenne!

56:28.300 --> 56:30.900
Goddamn it, Kenne!
Where are you?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.400
Pick him up!

56:46.300 --> 56:47.900
Don't you fucking touch me!

56:47.900 --> 56:50.700
Yeah, the fucking leach!
Back up! Back up!

56:50.700 --> 56:55.200
This motherfucker was stealing,
that's what happened.

56:55.200 --> 56:57.400
I found a whole stash
buried in the woods!

56:57.400 --> 57:00.400
I'm sorry! Okay?
I'm sorry!

57:09.200 --> 57:11.900
Ande... if I could
give it back, I would.

57:13.400 --> 57:16.800
Yes.
Ande?

57:16.800 --> 57:19.400
Give it back.
What?

57:19.400 --> 57:22.100
All of it.
Ande.

57:22.100 --> 57:26.300
Give it back now!
No!

57:26.300 --> 57:29.900
No, no, no, stop!
Give it back, Kenne!

57:29.900 --> 57:32.000
No! Hey! Hey!

57:32.000 --> 57:34.400
Give it back!
Let's just do him!

57:34.400 --> 57:35.900
Let's do it!

57:41.200 --> 57:43.100
You're a fucking...

57:43.100 --> 57:45.400
That's it! Just fucking stop!
Stop! Stop!

57:49.300 --> 57:55.200
While we were all starving, even
while my brother was starving!

57:55.300 --> 57:58.000
I'm not the only one!

57:58.000 --> 58:01.100
Slim was giving Sevy water!

58:01.100 --> 58:03.400
This is the piece of shit
you're trying to save!

58:03.400 --> 58:05.200
He's right! He's right.

58:05.200 --> 58:08.300
Me and Eva, too, taking turns,
giving him our rations.

58:08.300 --> 58:11.200
Are you going to hurt us, too?

58:11.200 --> 58:13.900
Because of him,
we never had a chance.

58:13.900 --> 58:16.500
Don't do this.

58:16.500 --> 58:20.000
What happens in a game
when you don't perform?

58:20.000 --> 58:21.300
Ande, this is not a game.

58:21.300 --> 58:24.200
What happens when you
let the team down?

58:24.200 --> 58:25.900
Ande, please?

58:29.600 --> 58:31.300
You get cut.

58:31.300 --> 58:34.900
Ande... Ande, come on.

58:34.900 --> 58:37.600
No!
Go! No! No!

58:42.600 --> 58:44.000
Stop it!

58:44.000 --> 58:47.300
- Felix!
- Slim, stop it!

58:47.300 --> 58:50.500
Get the knife out of his hand!
No, no, no, no, no!

58:51.700 --> 58:53.400
Felix, do something!

59:00.600 --> 59:03.500
Stop it!
No, no, no, no!

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.900
I'm going across the channel
to the second island.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.400
Starting over.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.100
I'm taking whoever
wants to come.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.600
Elena! No!

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.600
I'm taking the supplies.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.600
Half.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.200
Half.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.100
You're on your own.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.600
Who's still here?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.000
Eva, Sevy...

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.200
And me.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.100
Yeah...

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.000
and you.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.600
About Felix...

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.900
I didn't mean to.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.300
I know.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.400
If you've changed your mind
about being here...

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.800
I haven't.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.900
Andreas!

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:24.400
The night we crashed,
who was the guy in the water?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.400
It was too dark to see
exactly who he was...

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.600
but he was drowning.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.900
He was right in front of me.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.900
And I could have helped him...

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.300
but I swam right past.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.300
I didn't even look back.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:17.000
I think... we're all
here for a reason.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.399
Even you.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.100
All set!

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.200
Come on.

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.600
You got one of those for me?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
Eva.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.400
I can't believe it worked.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.800
Cool, right?

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.300
Anything?

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.700
I'll tell you
when there's anything.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:57.200
Markese... stop it!

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.200
You okay?

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.000
How long since you've eaten?

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.500
You could come back.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.700
There's food.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.900
I know what you're saying...
and I know what it means.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.900
But it's not going to happen.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.000
Not like you think.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:35.100
Elena... is she safe?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.400
She's where she needs to be.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.000
Someone came to our camp
last night.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.600
Left some tracks...
took some things.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.400
Things.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.500
Water.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.800
What was the final score
in the game?

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.600
I don't remember.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.000
Slim! Everything all right?

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.100
How'd it go?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.800
What's wrong?

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.700
I think they're coming back.

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.900
To join us?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.300
No.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.200
This is my fault.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:37.700
Brother... it's them or us.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.300
It can't be both.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.000
Ssh, it's okay, it's okay.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.300
It's just me.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
Ow! Bitch!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.300
Arnie, don't!

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.100
It's okay, it's just me.
It's just me.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.000
No, stop!

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
No! You bastar...

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.800
You fucking whore!

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:39.100
Elena?

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.300
Elena.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.400
Get back here!

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:12.000
Did you see what
Kenne did to Elena?

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
You saw that, right?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.100
You saw that, right?

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:30.300
Yeah, it's okay...
I'm gonna get him.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.100
Kenne, what the fuck
were you thinking, man!

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.700
I thought if I went over there,
maybe I could fix all of this...

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.200
but I couldn't, I'm sorry.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.800
What's wrong, you hurt?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.600
No, I'm fine... but Elena...

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.100
Elena, what?

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.500
Elena, what!

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.500
I don't know...
she wasn't moving.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.200
Andreas?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.100
No, he wasn't there.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.400
Slim, I keep fucking it up.
It's not your fault.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.200
If you wouldn't have gone,
we wouldn't know she was hurt, right?

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.800
I'll go see, I'll...

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.800
They're gonna come for me,
aren't they?

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.100
They're gonna come for us.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.600
Stay out of sight
until I get back.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.600
And then?

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.500
And then he ran.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.500
Elena, it's me.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.000
I know you're hurt...
but we gotta get back.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500
Just stay here until I get back.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.500
All right?
I won't be gone long.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.900
Hey! Hey! Over here!

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.400
Hey!

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.100
Hey, Slim, how you been?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.600
I fucking got him.
Time's up, Slim.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.500
Slim, get out of here.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.100
I know it was you!

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.700
Ssh.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.600
You guys okay?

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.100
Did you find Elena?

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.100
She's alive and safe.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.000
What now?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.800
Well, there's three of them
left and they're coming.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.600
We've got one chance of
surviving... we gotta attack.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.600
There's no way.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.700
We got no choice, Kenne...

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.000
unless you have some idea.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.800
There was three of them.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800
We have just one.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.300
Well, we got more than one,
open your eyes.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.700
Kenne! Can I count on you?

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.200
Yeah.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.300
Okay... here's what
we're gonna do.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.500
Arnie!

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.200
Arnie!

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.900
Arnie!

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.000
Hey, Slim... I'm sorry, Slim.
I'm sorry, plea...

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.800
Slim...

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.300
Elena!

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.200
Are you okay? Oh, my God.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.400
You know what you are, Kenne?

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.500
Yeah, I know what I am.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.400
Bait.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.200
Kenne.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.500
Let's go.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.000
Elena.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.500
Ande!

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.300
Slim, turn around!

01:31:53.800 --> 01:32:00.000
We found survivors in a raft,
two of your teammates.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600
Is there anyone else?

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700
No.
