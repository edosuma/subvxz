00:17.369 --> 00:19.188
You got me!

00:19.208 --> 00:21.328
I give up.

01:01.879 --> 01:04.780
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
She's finally here!

01:19.029 --> 01:21.734
Hello. I'm your new
home-operating system.

01:21.754 --> 01:24.309
My name is Lucy. What's yours?

01:24.329 --> 01:28.823
Uh, my name is Rick Castle,
and...

01:28.843 --> 01:31.440
And...

01:31.475 --> 01:33.843
my wife just left me.

01:33.878 --> 01:37.113
Yikes. Sucks to be you, Rick.

01:47.391 --> 01:48.624
Can't you hit
any harder than that?

01:50.394 --> 01:51.460
Oh!

01:53.430 --> 01:55.397
Oh. I'll take that as a yes.

01:55.431 --> 01:56.799
Come on.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.872
Listen. You can still back out.

02:03.907 --> 02:06.641
- I can do this on my own.
- Not a chance.

02:06.676 --> 02:09.144
I'd be dead if not for you,
which means I owe you.

02:09.179 --> 02:10.746
Besides, I always wanted

02:10.780 --> 02:14.149
to be a digital investigator
for the NYPD.

02:14.184 --> 02:15.117
It's a real job, Vikram.

02:15.151 --> 02:17.352
You'll be helping the 12th
solve homicides.

02:17.386 --> 02:18.587
By day.

02:18.621 --> 02:20.354
By night, I'll wear a cape

02:20.388 --> 02:21.856
and track down
the mysterious villain

02:21.890 --> 02:23.357
who sent a hit squad to kill us

02:23.391 --> 02:25.559
and scapegoat-murdered
Allison Hyde.

02:25.594 --> 02:27.483
Would you take this seriously,
please?

02:27.503 --> 02:30.942
I just blew up my marriage
to go down this path.

02:30.962 --> 02:32.433
I'm sorry.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.668
Hell, I should be giving you
the chance to back out.

02:34.703 --> 02:35.870
No.

02:35.904 --> 02:37.939
If I don't get justice for
Rachel and for everyone else,

02:37.973 --> 02:38.572
no one will.

02:38.607 --> 02:39.740
We just got to do this fast.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.443
Fast is the one speed
we can't move.

02:42.477 --> 02:43.778
We need stealth.

02:43.812 --> 02:44.846
If this takes any longer,

02:44.880 --> 02:46.413
then Castle is gonna figure out
what we're doing.

02:46.448 --> 02:47.915
And if he does?

02:47.950 --> 02:51.584
He's gonna step in, and he's
gonna put himself in danger.

02:51.619 --> 02:53.120
Then make sure he stays away.

02:53.154 --> 02:55.856
Has Beckett told you
anything about the breakup yet?

02:55.890 --> 02:58.091
Not a word.
You talked to Castle about it?

02:58.126 --> 03:00.360
No. And I've left him
a bunch of messages.

03:00.394 --> 03:01.594
Shakes your faith.

03:01.629 --> 03:03.864
I guess nothing in life
is permanent.

03:03.898 --> 03:05.294
Tell that to the victim.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.267
Oh, hey.

03:07.301 --> 03:08.135
Captain Beckett.

03:08.169 --> 03:10.103
What brings you out
into the field?

03:10.138 --> 03:11.170
Work.

03:11.204 --> 03:12.605
What, do you think
I'm gonna be stuck in the office

03:12.640 --> 03:14.374
- just 'cause I'm captain?
- We...

03:14.408 --> 03:16.208
- so, who's our fugitive?
- No I.D. yet.

03:16.243 --> 03:18.411
But the jumpsuit is
standard issue at Rikers.

03:18.445 --> 03:21.147
But they say that none of their
prisoners have gone missing.

03:21.181 --> 03:22.315
We had them lock down
the facility,

03:22.349 --> 03:24.651
but a 14,000-inmate head count
is gonna take some time.

03:24.685 --> 03:27.037
- You run his prints?
- Yeah. So far, nothing.

03:27.057 --> 03:30.422
Nothing?
The guy's a convicted felon.

03:30.456 --> 03:31.490
His fingerprints are on file.

03:31.524 --> 03:33.158
Probably a glitch.

03:33.192 --> 03:34.293
You know,
those portable scanners...

03:34.327 --> 03:35.627
- sometimes they're wonky.
- Yeah.

03:35.662 --> 03:37.496
Is there any chance that
this wasn't a homicide?

03:37.530 --> 03:38.497
None.

03:38.531 --> 03:39.531
It took brute force

03:39.565 --> 03:41.500
to puncture the victim's body
with that branch.

03:41.534 --> 03:43.440
Someone had to shove him
onto it.

03:44.671 --> 03:47.306
So how does an escaped convict
from Rikers Island

03:47.340 --> 03:49.274
end up in the middle
of Central Park

03:49.309 --> 03:50.741
without anyone seeing him?

03:50.776 --> 03:51.475
It was late.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.076
Lividity puts the time of death

03:53.111 --> 03:55.413
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

03:55.447 --> 03:56.447
All right, keep running prints.

03:56.481 --> 03:58.664
I'm gonna walk around
and see what I can find.

03:58.684 --> 03:59.583
Hey.

03:59.618 --> 04:01.619
You didn't call me back.

04:01.653 --> 04:03.275
Yeah,
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

04:03.295 --> 04:06.470
Oh, that's okay.
But are you okay?

04:08.093 --> 04:09.060
I'm fine.

04:09.094 --> 04:10.127
I'm just a-a little lost

04:10.161 --> 04:13.163
and taking some space
so I can figure things out.

04:13.197 --> 04:16.166
I just hope that
I haven't hurt him too much.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.233
Girl, please.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.903
Castle is a grown-ass man,

04:18.937 --> 04:21.471
and he knows
that you love him very much.

04:21.505 --> 04:22.806
I'm sure he's okay.

04:25.844 --> 04:28.245
I just don't know what to do,
Lucy.

04:29.748 --> 04:32.215
I've compiled a list of
top-ranked divorce attorneys.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.716
No! I don't want a divorce.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.219
I want my wife back.
How do I do that?

04:36.254 --> 04:37.254
I don't know.

04:37.288 --> 04:39.523
How did you get her
in the first place, Rick?

04:49.233 --> 04:50.600
Has Beckett talked to you?

04:51.869 --> 04:53.569
Give us a minute.

04:53.603 --> 04:57.406
You know better than to think
I would betray her confidence.

04:57.441 --> 04:58.674
Damn it, Lanie, tell me...

04:58.708 --> 05:00.443
why is Beckett
keeping me in the dark?

05:00.477 --> 05:02.778
The man who went Houdini
for two months last year?

05:02.812 --> 05:04.913
Whoa. I didn't Houdini.
I was houdinied.

05:04.948 --> 05:06.014
Doesn't matter.

05:06.049 --> 05:08.917
When you came back, she accepted
you without question,

05:08.952 --> 05:11.253
so you can damn well give her
some space now.

05:11.288 --> 05:12.254
I can't lose her.

05:12.289 --> 05:13.722
I know.

05:13.756 --> 05:15.023
Is that from the 12th?

05:18.328 --> 05:20.162
Castle.

05:21.831 --> 05:26.201
Escaped prisoner.
Young... maybe 21, 22?

05:26.235 --> 05:27.202
Is that...

05:27.236 --> 05:28.203
Iron fence?

05:28.237 --> 05:30.472
- Tree branch.
- Ouch.

05:30.506 --> 05:31.707
Got an I.D. yet?

05:31.741 --> 05:33.279
I'm not telling you.

05:35.389 --> 05:37.312
I've seen this devil before.

05:37.346 --> 05:38.546
Just stop.

05:38.581 --> 05:41.850
Working murders
is not your job anymore.

05:42.685 --> 05:45.420
He's gonna be
an absolute wreck.

05:45.454 --> 05:47.222
And it's our job
not to let him spin out.

05:47.256 --> 05:49.390
That's what the C.D.R.K. is for.

05:49.425 --> 05:51.959
- "Castle depression rescue kit."
- Mmhmm.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.329
Video games,
sumatran civet coffee beans,

05:54.363 --> 05:56.764
enhanced blu-rays of the
original "Twilight Zone," and...

05:56.798 --> 05:58.933
- this.
- 9-woof-woof?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.336
Mm-hmm. Puppies at your doorstep
in 30 minutes or less.

06:01.370 --> 06:02.870
- Ah.
- Puppies.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.407
Good morning, my lovelies.

06:06.442 --> 06:09.043
Isn't it great to be alive?

06:11.380 --> 06:14.014
Richard, are you feeling okay?

06:14.048 --> 06:15.249
Never better.

06:15.283 --> 06:17.317
Because I know
how to win Beckett back.

06:17.352 --> 06:19.119
Is she wanting to be won back?

06:19.154 --> 06:22.656
When we first met,
it was my roguish charm

06:22.690 --> 06:25.125
that caused Beckett
to drop her guard,

06:25.160 --> 06:27.194
but it was my sherlockian skills

06:27.228 --> 06:28.862
that made her
fall in love with me.

06:28.896 --> 06:32.098
I just have to solve
a few cases with her

06:32.133 --> 06:35.868
to show her that, together,
we are still magic.

06:35.902 --> 06:37.303
Richard, you do know

06:37.337 --> 06:39.639
that you cannot just barge
your way into the precinct

06:39.673 --> 06:41.474
and talk your way
onto a case anymore.

06:41.508 --> 06:44.143
I am a licensed
private investigator.

06:44.178 --> 06:47.046
I don't need a precinct
to solve a case.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.517
Now, this tattoo was on the body
of a dead convict

06:51.552 --> 06:53.619
found in Central Park.

06:53.654 --> 06:55.120
I know I've seen it
somewhere before.

06:55.155 --> 06:57.423
I just don't know where.

06:58.424 --> 06:59.924
I do.

07:02.562 --> 07:05.363
Hey. Um, Rikers completed
their head count.

07:05.398 --> 07:07.566
All inmates are accounted for.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.133
So, where'd the Vic's jumpsuit
come from?

07:09.168 --> 07:09.901
A costume shop.

07:09.935 --> 07:11.670
Our John Doe was not an inmate.

07:11.704 --> 07:12.804
He was a college student.

07:12.838 --> 07:16.040
Tattoo on his shoulder is
the original mascot design

07:16.075 --> 07:17.475
of the Hudson U. Red Devils.

07:17.510 --> 07:19.211
Now, I checked
the college website.

07:19.245 --> 07:20.712
Peter Garber.

07:20.746 --> 07:23.380
21 years old,
majoring in marketing.

07:23.415 --> 07:25.282
But that doesn't explain
the jumpsuit.

07:26.384 --> 07:29.053
You guys, it's October.

07:29.088 --> 07:31.322
Halloween's basically
a month-long party in college.

07:33.926 --> 07:36.560
Ah, the hallowed halls
of academia.

07:36.595 --> 07:38.162
I remember them well.

07:38.197 --> 07:40.431
More like the hallowed halls
of crackheads in my schools.

07:40.465 --> 07:41.733
Head over to Peter's frat house.

07:41.767 --> 07:42.633
Interview his roommates.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.201
I'm gonna break the bad news
to the Dean.

07:44.235 --> 07:45.468
- Right.
- Okay.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.171
Hi. I'm Captain Beckett.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.440
I need to speak
with Dean Feller, please.

07:52.243 --> 07:54.981
It will be nice to have a
best-selling author on the faculty.

07:55.001 --> 07:55.593
Oh.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.513
Welcome to the Hudson family,
Mr. Castle.

07:57.548 --> 07:59.850
Oh, please, Dean Feller,
call me "Professor Castle."

08:00.952 --> 08:02.052
Oh.

08:02.086 --> 08:03.720
Captain Beckett.

08:03.755 --> 08:05.455
Fancy seeing you here.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.316
S08E03
PhDead

08:11.336 --> 08:14.263
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

08:15.537 --> 08:17.144
Castle,
I know what you're doing.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.188
I'm giving back to the community
by molding young minds?

08:20.208 --> 08:21.823
You're not joining this case.

08:21.843 --> 08:24.077
- Aren't you two married?
- Yes, we are.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.478
Dean Feller, meet captain
Beckett of the 12th precinct.

08:26.498 --> 08:29.549
Yes. And husband and wife
need a moment in private.

08:31.419 --> 08:33.052
Whoa, whoa, hang on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:33.086 --> 08:34.186
Ah.

08:34.221 --> 08:35.754
It took me an hour to tie this.

08:35.789 --> 08:38.924
Oh, you saw the tattoo
at the morgue, didn't you?

08:38.958 --> 08:41.559
I saw Lanie at the morgue.

08:41.594 --> 08:44.096
I can't recall
if I saw other things

08:44.131 --> 08:47.033
on bodies
with gruesome chest wounds.

08:47.067 --> 08:50.303
Let me ask you... how large of
a donation check did you write

08:50.337 --> 08:52.138
in order to become a professor?

08:52.172 --> 08:53.705
Guest professor.

08:53.740 --> 08:56.242
Look... I have no desire
to interfere with your case,

08:56.276 --> 08:59.211
but I can't help it if
my path crosses with yours

08:59.246 --> 09:00.278
while I'm teaching here.

09:00.313 --> 09:02.314
Castle, I asked for time.

09:02.348 --> 09:03.782
Why can't you give me that?

09:03.817 --> 09:05.918
Because you need me.

09:07.286 --> 09:09.054
I... I can't do this right now.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.019
- Kate.
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

09:11.039 --> 09:14.125
but I really need to know why
there are police on my campus.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.061
A student of yours,
Peter Garber,

09:16.095 --> 09:19.145
was found murdered
in Central Park last night.

09:19.282 --> 09:20.666
That's awful.

09:20.700 --> 09:24.069
He was a wonderful young man...
a model student.

09:24.103 --> 09:25.561
He won
this year's fellowship award.

09:25.581 --> 09:28.073
Well, I'll need access
to all of his files,

09:28.107 --> 09:29.407
as well as a discreet room

09:29.442 --> 09:30.808
to interview his teachers
and friends.

09:30.843 --> 09:31.809
Of course.

09:31.844 --> 09:33.871
And as for you...

09:33.891 --> 09:36.948
Professor, this is
a police investigation.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.282
Stay out of it.

09:41.741 --> 09:43.721
She's such a kidder.

09:45.724 --> 09:47.992
We got something.

09:48.026 --> 09:49.494
What's wrong?

09:49.528 --> 09:51.161
Castle's here.

09:51.196 --> 09:54.163
He bought himself a PhD
to get in on this case.

09:54.198 --> 09:56.500
You guys are not
to work with him in any way.

09:56.534 --> 09:57.601
Is that understood?

09:57.635 --> 09:58.702
- Yeah.
- Yes. Absolutely.

09:58.736 --> 10:00.882
- Okay, so, what do we got?
- A suspect.

10:01.503 --> 10:02.359
Yeah?

10:02.379 --> 10:05.598
Peter was pledge master at the
beta omega rho fraternity house.

10:05.618 --> 10:08.191
Let me guess... he hazed someone
and they threatened revenge?

10:08.211 --> 10:09.713
The opposite, actually.
Scott Powell.

10:09.747 --> 10:11.748
Former beta omega.

10:11.782 --> 10:13.502
Scott terrorized
a group of pledges,

10:13.522 --> 10:15.028
got one of them
sent to the hospital.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.988
So Peter turned Scott in,
got him booted from the frat.

10:18.022 --> 10:19.623
Okay, well,
that sounds like motive.

10:19.657 --> 10:20.957
Let's bring him in
for questioning.

10:20.992 --> 10:22.558
Yeah, that might not be
the right approach.

10:22.593 --> 10:24.227
Scott's dad
is a defense attorney.

10:24.261 --> 10:26.062
When the university tried
to expel Scott,

10:26.097 --> 10:27.130
daddy threatened to sue.

10:27.164 --> 10:28.665
So Scott's not gonna talk to us.

10:28.699 --> 10:31.300
Unless we can get him to talk

10:31.335 --> 10:33.412
without him realizing
that he's talking?

10:33.847 --> 10:35.338
How do you plan on doing that?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.529
So, how's the talent
in your marketing class?

11:00.563 --> 11:02.831
Oh, solid. Especially
this hot blonde named Jenny.

11:02.866 --> 11:03.866
- Aw, for real?
- Yeah.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.669
Hey, did you see that
that frat boy got murdered

11:06.703 --> 11:07.469
last night in the park?

11:07.503 --> 11:10.172
Aw, yeah.
I heard he got impaled.

11:10.206 --> 11:12.808
Ah, was it
Peter, uh... Something.

11:12.842 --> 11:14.376
What house was he in?

11:14.410 --> 11:15.943
I have no idea.

11:15.978 --> 11:18.785
Hey, bro, you know what frat
the dead dude's from?

11:19.988 --> 11:20.848
No, officer, I sure don't.

11:20.883 --> 11:22.617
What?

11:22.652 --> 11:23.618
We ain't cops, man.

11:23.653 --> 11:24.952
Dude, you look like you're 40.

11:24.987 --> 11:27.689
Bitch, please.
I got carded last week.

11:27.723 --> 11:29.551
Yeah, for your AARP card.

11:29.571 --> 11:32.327
And your partner's growing
ear hair in front of my eyes.

11:34.530 --> 11:35.564
All right, funny man.

11:35.598 --> 11:37.699
We heard that you had a hate-on
for Peter Garber.

11:37.733 --> 11:39.333
So you want to tell us
where you were last night?

11:39.367 --> 11:40.902
No. But you can call my lawyer.

11:40.936 --> 11:43.204
He's gonna get a real kick
out of you guys.

11:43.238 --> 11:44.138
Have a nice day.

11:45.447 --> 11:48.735
Oh, and remember...
fiber's your friend.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.848
I don't really have
old-man ear hair, do I?

11:53.882 --> 11:55.382
Guys.

11:55.417 --> 11:56.450
You didn't really think

11:56.484 --> 11:58.752
you could "jump street"
the prime suspect, did you?

11:58.786 --> 12:00.353
Castle, what are you doing here?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.823
I heard about the
Scott Powell hazing incident.

12:02.857 --> 12:05.461
I thought I'd offer the
NYPD my P.I. services.

12:05.481 --> 12:05.940
No, thanks.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.551
- Free of charge.
- No, thanks.

12:07.571 --> 12:08.432
All right, fine.

12:08.452 --> 12:11.865
I guess I'll just use
my newfound faculty privileges

12:11.899 --> 12:12.933
to talk to Scott on my own.

12:12.967 --> 12:15.736
He's got a contemporary-lit
class in 30 minutes.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.738
They have a very special
guest speaker...

12:17.772 --> 12:22.608
a certain ruggedly handsome
best-selling author.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.410
He just might be
the angle we need

12:25.445 --> 12:26.912
to get this guy Scott to talk.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.048
Beckett gave us a direct order.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.549
Will she be more upset

12:30.583 --> 12:32.618
when she finds out Castle
solved this case before us,

12:32.652 --> 12:34.920
or when she finds out
we've been cooperating with him?

12:34.955 --> 12:39.792
Perhaps my secret weapon is
the loophole you're looking for.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.961
What secret weapon?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.234
Anybody sitting there?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.749
Uh, you are.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.239
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.874
Uh, I'm Scott.

12:55.908 --> 12:56.941
Clara.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.911
So, you know anything about
this Richard Castle guy?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.112
A little.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.915
He's an irreverent crime
novelist with a carefree spirit

13:03.949 --> 13:06.451
and a hatred
of exclamation marks.

13:07.103 --> 13:08.219
Or so I hear.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.254
Hmm.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.490
Well, I saw an interview
with him a few years ago.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.124
He was trying way too hard
to be cool.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.825
I'm sure he's mellowed with age.

13:16.828 --> 13:21.098
"To die, to sleep...

13:21.132 --> 13:24.067
To sleep, perchance to dream."

13:24.102 --> 13:25.235
Or not.

13:25.270 --> 13:28.339
"Aye, for there's the rub.

13:28.373 --> 13:30.908
For in this sleep of death,
what dreams may come?"

13:30.942 --> 13:33.778
William Shakespeare, the bard.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.615
A man as intimate with violence
and murder as any in history.

13:37.649 --> 13:42.620
Who can tell me the classic
motivations for murder?

13:46.391 --> 13:48.858
You, in the printed
non-ironic tee

13:48.892 --> 13:51.260
beside the too-friendly blonde.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.197
- Oh, me?
- Yes.

13:54.231 --> 13:56.466
What might drive a person
to murder?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.000
I don't know. Revenge?

13:58.035 --> 13:58.901
Revenge.

13:58.936 --> 14:02.104
A man wronged,
his reputation besmirched,

14:02.139 --> 14:04.768
so he strikes out in passion.

14:04.788 --> 14:07.977
Some might consider
his actions justified.

14:08.784 --> 14:11.981
What else might drive a person
to kill?

14:12.015 --> 14:13.683
Being forced to read one
of your books?

14:15.653 --> 14:18.988
Though that's probably more
of a motive for suicide.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.125
And, uh, what was
the last book you read...

14:23.160 --> 14:25.361
"Zen and the art of hazing hipsters"?

14:27.030 --> 14:29.232
Oh, I love how you come in here
quoting Shakespeare

14:29.266 --> 14:31.067
like it's just gonna
magically elevate

14:31.101 --> 14:33.302
that treadmill fiction
you write.

14:33.337 --> 14:35.004
Treadmill fi...

14:36.846 --> 14:37.740
Get out.

14:37.774 --> 14:39.141
Now.

14:39.176 --> 14:41.152
Works for me.

14:49.051 --> 14:50.218
Are you okay?

14:50.253 --> 14:51.820
What the hell?

14:51.855 --> 14:53.989
First the cops try and front me,
and then that clown.

14:54.023 --> 14:54.990
Cops?

14:55.024 --> 14:58.894
A guy from my old frat
got killed last night.

14:58.928 --> 15:00.562
Peter Garber.

15:00.597 --> 15:01.697
They think I hated him

15:01.731 --> 15:04.665
'cause he got me kicked out
for hazing some newbies.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.601
But I spent the last semester
trying to make amends.

15:06.635 --> 15:07.835
- With Peter?
- Yeah.

15:07.870 --> 15:10.872
Told him I was sorry, you know,
and he said we were cool.

15:10.907 --> 15:11.739
He even asked me for a favor.

15:11.774 --> 15:13.875
Said he needed
a quiet place to study

15:13.910 --> 15:14.642
away from the frat house.

15:14.676 --> 15:16.378
I work at residential housing,

15:16.412 --> 15:20.497
so I hooked him up with
an empty apartment on the D.L.

15:20.517 --> 15:22.117
Why didn't you tell the cops?

15:22.151 --> 15:23.084
My dad's a lawyer,

15:23.119 --> 15:25.953
and he taught me you never trust
the police.

15:25.987 --> 15:28.289
Actually, you know,
he also taught me

15:28.323 --> 15:30.357
that blondes are more fun.

15:30.392 --> 15:32.092
What say we go out later?

15:32.127 --> 15:33.894
My crew and I found this great
bar last night called Jinx.

15:33.929 --> 15:35.963
I'd love to, but I'm actually
getting fitted for an iron lung

15:35.997 --> 15:37.064
in the morning.

15:37.098 --> 15:38.498
Bye.

15:40.822 --> 15:43.304
Okay, Vikram. What have you got?

15:43.324 --> 15:46.073
I might have identified
Allison Hyde's killer.

15:46.107 --> 15:47.574
Pulled footage
from the hotel cameras

15:47.608 --> 15:49.108
around the time Hyde was killed.

15:49.143 --> 15:51.945
Managed to I.D. everyone,
except this guy.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.050
Look, this doesn't
mean anything.

15:57.084 --> 15:58.051
There's plenty of people

15:58.085 --> 16:00.273
who aren't in our
facial-recognition database.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.055
Didn't just use ours.

16:02.089 --> 16:03.293
I snuck into the NSA,

16:03.313 --> 16:04.791
ran him through
their top-secret database.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.326
It's a civil-liberties
nightmare,

16:06.360 --> 16:07.877
but very comprehensive.

16:07.897 --> 16:10.564
Our well-dressed man
is a total ghost.

16:10.598 --> 16:13.266
So unless you know
a ghostbuster,

16:13.300 --> 16:14.935
we're out of luck.

16:16.703 --> 16:17.970
I-I might know somebody.

16:18.004 --> 16:20.506
He's helped me out in the past,

16:20.540 --> 16:22.174
and he's connected
to this world.

16:22.208 --> 16:23.776
But he's technically dead,

16:23.810 --> 16:26.376
which means you're gonna have
to dig him up.

16:27.046 --> 16:30.871
Just to be clear,
you mean he faked his own death

16:30.891 --> 16:33.085
and now he's hiding
under a new identity

16:33.119 --> 16:34.753
that you need me to uncover?

16:34.788 --> 16:36.355
Yeah.

16:36.389 --> 16:38.958
Good. 'Cause I'm not a huge fan
of shoveling.

16:44.030 --> 16:47.599
What are the odds Peter really
wanted this apartment for studying?

16:49.334 --> 16:52.670
I'd say those odds
are less than zero.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.139
NYPD.

16:59.211 --> 17:01.312
I thought Peter was majoring
in marketing,

17:01.346 --> 17:02.380
not medieval torture.

17:02.414 --> 17:05.082
This stuff isn't for torture.
It's a BDSM dungeon.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.553
What? I read "Fifty Shades,"
and clearly so had Peter.

17:10.431 --> 17:12.321
Okay.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.959
I'm thinking this is
a little less "Fifty Shades"

17:15.993 --> 17:19.329
and a little more
"Fatal Attraction."

17:25.244 --> 17:29.171
So, Peter and
his bondage-curious lover

17:29.191 --> 17:31.705
set up shop here to fulfill
all their fantasies.

17:31.725 --> 17:32.931
Mm. Role play.

17:32.951 --> 17:35.537
Perhaps kinky convict
and wicked warden.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.020
D...

17:37.055 --> 17:39.394
Anyway, Peter tries to break it off.

17:39.414 --> 17:42.693
The lover, spurned,
flies into a murderous rage,

17:42.727 --> 17:44.444
and then impales him
in the park.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.696
All right. We need to figure out
who Peter's been...

17:46.730 --> 17:47.831
Entertaining here.

17:47.865 --> 17:49.032
That means we need to start
knocking on some doors,

17:49.067 --> 17:51.768
- pulling surveillance footage.
- There's an easier way.

17:51.802 --> 17:52.769
Frat boys love to kiss and tell.

17:52.803 --> 17:54.704
If anyone knows
who Peter was involved with,

17:54.738 --> 17:55.638
it will be his brothers.

17:55.673 --> 17:57.707
Yeah, but they
weren't exactly forthcoming

17:57.741 --> 17:59.676
- when we interviewed them earlier.
- Yeah.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.411
That's because you're "the man."

18:01.446 --> 18:02.712
But I'm not.

18:21.064 --> 18:22.064
I'm in.

18:22.099 --> 18:23.600
She's in.

18:23.634 --> 18:24.667
We heard.

18:24.702 --> 18:27.604
You know this isn't
her first frat party, Castle.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.606
You trying to make me
feel better?

18:29.640 --> 18:30.673
You know, it's understandable

18:30.708 --> 18:32.709
if you're feeling a little
overprotective right now

18:32.743 --> 18:34.443
with what's been happening
with Beckett.

18:34.478 --> 18:37.079
"What's happening" is
I'm getting her back.

18:37.114 --> 18:39.215
Are you sure
this is the right way to do it?

18:39.249 --> 18:41.784
She was pretty clear that she did
not want you working this case.

18:41.819 --> 18:44.387
Working cases together is
why she fell in love with me.

18:44.421 --> 18:46.823
That's why I'm going to do
whatever it takes

18:46.857 --> 18:48.056
to solve this case.

18:48.090 --> 18:49.958
Including sending your daughter

18:49.993 --> 18:51.927
into a house full
of drunken frat boys,

18:51.961 --> 18:53.595
dressed like a slutty angel?

18:55.932 --> 18:58.066
Open it. Open it.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.768
It's so sad about Peter.

18:59.802 --> 19:01.302
Were you close with him?

19:01.337 --> 19:03.471
Mmmmmmm.

19:03.506 --> 19:04.372
He was a hottie.

19:04.407 --> 19:05.841
I bet he had
a lot of girlfriends, huh?

19:05.875 --> 19:07.576
Mmmmmmm.

19:07.610 --> 19:08.977
Mmmmmmm.

19:09.012 --> 19:09.945
Hey, hey, hey.

19:09.979 --> 19:12.247
- Her eyes are up here.
- What are you doing?

19:12.281 --> 19:13.849
- I got this.
- Do you?

19:13.883 --> 19:15.616
'Cause I'm hearing
a whole lot of flirting

19:15.651 --> 19:17.785
and zero fact-finding
on who Peter was dating.

19:17.819 --> 19:19.754
Hey, bro. I saw her first.

19:19.788 --> 19:20.955
Get your own girl.

19:20.989 --> 19:21.956
- Ew.
- Ew.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.324
I mean it.
Hit the road, old man.

19:24.359 --> 19:25.192
Old man?

19:25.226 --> 19:27.728
This old man
is gonna kick your ass.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.768
At beer pong.

19:33.802 --> 19:36.103
Beer-pong challenge, everyone!

19:36.137 --> 19:37.672
What exactly is your strategy?

19:37.706 --> 19:39.139
To get any man
to confide in you,

19:39.174 --> 19:41.008
you must first earn his respect.

19:41.043 --> 19:43.610
To do that, I need to bro down.

19:43.644 --> 19:44.844
Thank you.

19:46.413 --> 19:47.814
All right.

19:50.350 --> 19:51.651
Oh!

19:53.754 --> 19:55.455
Mmm.

19:55.489 --> 19:56.623
Oh.

19:56.657 --> 19:57.724
10 bucks on Castle.

19:57.758 --> 20:00.126
You're on.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.033
Hey, Captain.

20:07.068 --> 20:08.635
What are you doing here?

20:08.669 --> 20:09.736
- Surveillance.
- Canvassing.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.537
- Surveillance.
- Canvassing.

20:11.572 --> 20:14.907
In your face, Frankenstein.

20:14.941 --> 20:16.809
We can explain.

20:16.843 --> 20:19.812
I ask one thing of you guys.

20:19.846 --> 20:22.381
Whoo!

20:22.416 --> 20:24.817
All right, all right.

20:25.885 --> 20:27.353
Whoo!

20:29.022 --> 20:30.356
Whoo!

20:32.726 --> 20:33.526
Mmm.

20:36.763 --> 20:38.231
Terrible thing about Peter.

20:38.265 --> 20:40.533
Wish I would have
gotten to know him better.

20:43.936 --> 20:47.772
You, uh, spoken to Julie?
She must be devastated.

20:47.806 --> 20:48.640
Who's Julie?

20:48.674 --> 20:50.375
Isn't that Peter's
girlfriend's name?

20:50.409 --> 20:52.344
Peter was all about
this cougar professor,

20:52.378 --> 20:53.278
Dr. Lillstrom.

20:53.312 --> 20:55.680
He spent all of his free time
with her,

20:55.714 --> 20:56.714
if you know what I mean.

20:56.749 --> 20:59.251
Oh, someone didn't skip
his lesson on subtext.

20:59.285 --> 21:01.319
All right, last shot,
professor. Bring it.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.525
Thank you.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.260
Oops.

21:12.998 --> 21:14.365
Drink.

21:15.968 --> 21:17.769
All right. Party's over.

21:17.803 --> 21:20.938
Unless you want me
to start checking I.D.s.

21:20.973 --> 21:22.774
That was a nice shot.
We should team up.

21:22.808 --> 21:23.908
We could pong hustle.

21:23.942 --> 21:25.943
Castle, go home. You're drunk.

21:25.978 --> 21:28.212
I'm not drunk.
I'm casing the crack.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.580
Crack... crack...

21:29.614 --> 21:30.581
Cracking the case.

21:30.615 --> 21:31.783
You're a lightweight.

21:31.817 --> 21:33.650
Come on, dad. Time to go.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.752
Okay, angel. You're driving.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.091
You're pretty hot for a cop.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.559
- I have a gun.
- Right.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.997
- Beckett.
- It's Vikram.

21:47.031 --> 21:50.399
I found your dead guy
resurrected in New Jersey.

21:50.433 --> 21:52.968
And I know
where you can find him.

21:58.473 --> 22:00.810
It's been a long time.

22:04.283 --> 22:05.514
What the hell
are you doing here?

22:05.548 --> 22:07.983
Sorry to shake your snow globe,
but you helped me once

22:08.018 --> 22:09.985
when I was being framed
for Vulcan Simmons's murder,

22:10.020 --> 22:10.986
and I need your help again.

22:11.021 --> 22:12.576
Forget it.

22:12.596 --> 22:13.823
I paid all my debts.

22:13.857 --> 22:16.258
This man killed
an assistant A.G.

22:16.292 --> 22:19.027
Connected to Bracken's
dirty-money scheme.

22:19.061 --> 22:19.794
I don't know him.

22:19.829 --> 22:21.430
He works for Bracken's partner,

22:21.464 --> 22:24.799
some mystery man or woman
deep inside the CIA.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.892
Why can't you
just leave this alone?

22:28.910 --> 22:30.839
I wasn't built that way.

22:32.239 --> 22:34.138
Look,
I've got a good thing here.

22:34.158 --> 22:37.379
A woman who loves me,
a new life.

22:37.413 --> 22:41.045
I'm happy. You could be, too.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.818
You just have to let it go.

22:44.855 --> 22:46.855
I can't.

22:53.713 --> 22:55.830
What makes you think
the drug shipments stopped

22:55.865 --> 22:57.477
with Vulcan Simmons's death?

22:57.497 --> 23:01.069
Every narcotic has a signature,
a fingerprint, if you will.

23:01.103 --> 23:04.302
You find his,
you pick up the trail.

23:06.075 --> 23:08.576
- Thank you.
- Don't.

23:08.610 --> 23:11.345
You're gonna get yourself
killed.

23:13.265 --> 23:15.065
Come on, boy.

23:24.693 --> 23:25.993
Unh.

23:26.027 --> 23:29.794
Oh. You're getting too
old for drinking games, kiddo.

23:29.814 --> 23:31.098
It was for the case.

23:31.132 --> 23:33.934
The one that Katherine keeps
throwing you off of?

23:33.968 --> 23:36.520
I didn't win her love overnight
the first time.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.039
I'm making progress, huh?

23:39.073 --> 23:40.340
Hey.

23:40.374 --> 23:42.671
Where are we
on Peter's faculty girlfriend?

23:42.677 --> 23:43.511
Dr. Barbara Lillstrom,

23:43.545 --> 23:45.746
head of the psych department
at Hudson U.

23:45.780 --> 23:47.247
Top of her class
at Harvard med school.

23:47.281 --> 23:48.782
She was advising
Peter's senior thesis.

23:48.817 --> 23:51.284
And they had an illicit
student-faculty relationship,

23:51.319 --> 23:54.861
one that ended ugly
once he rejected her.

23:54.881 --> 23:57.056
Yeah, I'm betting Peter
was expecting a bad grade,

23:57.090 --> 23:57.857
not impalement.

23:57.892 --> 23:59.458
I contacted
the psych department.

23:59.493 --> 24:00.827
Lillstrom's been out all week.

24:00.861 --> 24:02.395
She could be on the run.

24:02.429 --> 24:03.730
If she is, she didn't run far.

24:03.764 --> 24:05.231
Or at least her phone didn't.

24:05.265 --> 24:06.633
Her cell signal went dead
yesterday,

24:06.667 --> 24:08.067
but it last pinged off a tower

24:08.101 --> 24:09.936
outside of
a tenantless building here.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.938
That's four blocks away
from where Peter was killed.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.440
You know, if you want
to curry favor with Katherine

24:14.474 --> 24:16.108
after last night's
little debacle,

24:16.143 --> 24:17.076
you might tell her about this.

24:17.110 --> 24:20.513
No, first, we'll confirm
Lillstrom is there.

24:20.548 --> 24:22.615
Then we'll call in the cavalry.

24:30.356 --> 24:32.323
Times like this,
I wish you were more comfortable

24:32.358 --> 24:34.860
carrying a gun on your person,
not just in your desk.

24:34.894 --> 24:39.731
A good P.I. relies on his wits
first, bullets second.

24:48.691 --> 24:50.552
After your wits.

24:55.714 --> 24:57.517
What was that?

25:11.763 --> 25:15.633
This explains
Peter's prison jumpsuit.

25:23.639 --> 25:25.305
- Don't move.
- Easy there, fella.

25:25.340 --> 25:26.340
Unless you're a New York yankee,

25:26.374 --> 25:28.475
quit trying
to steal second base.

25:28.510 --> 25:29.976
Watch your mouth.

25:30.011 --> 25:32.400
I'm just saying,
buy me a drink first.

25:35.149 --> 25:36.482
Take this.

25:36.517 --> 25:38.518
Here, open 4.

25:42.823 --> 25:44.232
No. What?

25:46.994 --> 25:48.762
Are you sure about this?

25:48.796 --> 25:50.521
I have to warn the warden.

25:52.399 --> 25:53.599
What kind of prison is this?

25:53.634 --> 25:56.435
Take a look around.

25:56.470 --> 25:57.670
You notice any similarities...

25:57.704 --> 25:59.438
Between the guards
and the inmates?

26:00.480 --> 26:03.008
- Wait... they're all my age.
- Exactly.

26:03.043 --> 26:05.545
And I'm betting they're all
Hudson University students.

26:05.579 --> 26:08.583
They're doing a re-enactment of
the Stanford Prison experiment.

26:09.029 --> 26:10.449
That thing from the '70s

26:10.484 --> 26:12.051
where they studied
the psychological effects

26:12.085 --> 26:14.620
of making students pretend
to be prisoners and guards?

26:14.655 --> 26:15.588
Makes sense.

26:15.622 --> 26:18.057
Dr. Lillstrom is head
of the psych department.

26:18.091 --> 26:19.724
Who else is gonna have
the kind of pull

26:19.758 --> 26:21.726
to put something like this
together?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.861
Maybe Peter shawshanked his way
out of here.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.430
Peter?

26:26.432 --> 26:28.214
He actually escaped?

26:29.132 --> 26:30.535
You know Peter?

26:30.570 --> 26:32.140
He was in your cell,

26:32.160 --> 26:34.472
but one day we woke up
and he was just gone.

26:34.507 --> 26:36.675
- What did the guards say?
- They freaked.

26:36.709 --> 26:38.109
How'd he get out of his cell?

26:38.143 --> 26:40.645
But we... we didn't know if they
were just messing with our heads,

26:40.680 --> 26:42.747
'cause that's what they do here.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.107
Did you volunteer for this?

26:45.127 --> 26:47.719
I needed the money,
but now I just want to go home.

26:47.753 --> 26:49.920
Wait a minute. Y-you mean,
there's no panic button?

26:49.954 --> 26:52.356
There's no safety mechanism
if you want to quit?

26:52.390 --> 26:53.357
There was a white flag,

26:53.391 --> 26:55.759
but they removed it
when Peter was demoted.

26:55.793 --> 26:57.094
Peter was a guard
before he was an inmate?

26:57.128 --> 27:00.397
Head guard,
recruited by Warden Lillstrom.

27:00.432 --> 27:02.399
But he was nice to us.

27:02.434 --> 27:04.435
I think that's why
Lillstrom turned on him.

27:04.469 --> 27:07.338
She made Peter an inmate,
forced him to sit in the chair.

27:07.372 --> 27:09.206
What chair are we talking about?

27:09.241 --> 27:10.708
Our daily interrogations.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.245
We're strapped to a chair.

27:14.279 --> 27:18.014
Lillstrom flashes images
in our eyes over and over.

27:18.049 --> 27:20.484
All these strange lights.

27:21.453 --> 27:23.787
What does Lillstrom
want to know?

27:23.821 --> 27:26.689
Our secrets.
The darker, the better.

27:26.724 --> 27:29.392
It's like she's
sliding around your brain,

27:29.426 --> 27:30.826
peeking into your soul.

27:33.839 --> 27:35.197
Hey.

27:35.232 --> 27:36.266
Come open this cell.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.967
I give the orders here, inmate.

27:38.001 --> 27:39.302
And I give the grades.

27:39.336 --> 27:40.870
You saw my faculty I.D.

27:40.904 --> 27:42.472
So, here's the pop quiz.

27:42.506 --> 27:43.740
Failure to open this cell

27:43.774 --> 27:46.309
will cause an oh-so-disastrous
end to your academic career...

27:46.343 --> 27:48.314
true or false?

27:57.287 --> 27:58.999
Hey. Hers too.

28:03.803 --> 28:05.960
Take us to Dr. Lillstrom
right now.

28:05.995 --> 28:10.731
Warden. We, um, have a problem.

28:10.766 --> 28:14.102
Damn right we do... years of
planning, of research, ruined!

28:14.136 --> 28:16.237
Do you have any idea
of the damage you've caused?

28:16.272 --> 28:17.138
Ask me if I care.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.640
We're here
investigating Peter's murder.

28:19.675 --> 28:21.593
Peter's dead?

28:21.613 --> 28:24.679
Look, he broke out.
That's not my responsibility.

28:24.713 --> 28:26.747
New York's a dangerous town.

28:26.782 --> 28:28.749
We know all about
your relationship with Peter.

28:28.784 --> 28:30.818
I'm the adviser
on his thesis.

28:30.852 --> 28:32.620
You advised him
on a lot more than that.

28:32.654 --> 28:33.854
You were having an affair.

28:33.888 --> 28:35.022
Excuse me?

28:35.056 --> 28:36.857
We found your little sex dungeon

28:36.891 --> 28:38.426
and the message
you wrote on the mirror.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.461
Peter broke up with you,
didn't he?

28:40.495 --> 28:42.596
So you punished him
the only way you knew how

28:42.631 --> 28:44.332
by making him your prisoner.

28:44.366 --> 28:45.299
Then he escaped.

28:45.334 --> 28:46.834
Is that when you decided
he had to die, doctor?

28:46.868 --> 28:48.869
You killed Peter?

28:48.903 --> 28:50.170
I-it's not true. Any of it.

28:50.205 --> 28:51.839
- You're coming with me.
- Wha...

28:53.199 --> 28:54.041
You open those cells,

28:54.075 --> 28:56.810
but no one leaves here until
I've returned with the police.

28:56.845 --> 28:57.777
Do not listen to him.

28:57.812 --> 29:00.147
Oh, and, uh,
you're indoors and it's dark,

29:00.181 --> 29:01.681
so take off the sunglasses.
You look stupid.

29:04.152 --> 29:05.052
Yet another case closed

29:05.086 --> 29:08.521
courtesy of Richard Castle Investigations.

29:10.798 --> 29:12.860
Um, who is this woman?

29:12.894 --> 29:14.694
And are you in handcuffs?

29:14.729 --> 29:15.662
This man abducted me.

29:15.696 --> 29:17.865
It's not an abduction.
It's a citizen's arrest.

29:17.899 --> 29:19.166
Please get it straight.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.468
Beckett,
please meet Dr. Lillstrom.

29:21.502 --> 29:23.336
She was Peter's teacher...
with benefits.

29:23.371 --> 29:24.537
The real kinky kind, too.

29:24.572 --> 29:26.239
But when Peter ended
their trysts,

29:26.273 --> 29:28.375
she locked him up in a secret,
underground prison experiment,

29:28.409 --> 29:29.542
which is where I caught her.

29:29.577 --> 29:31.177
You're welcome, honey.

29:31.211 --> 29:33.546
You went
to an underground prison?

29:33.887 --> 29:34.714
Alone?

29:34.749 --> 29:36.315
No, not alone.
I had Alexis with me.

29:36.350 --> 29:38.385
Oh, well, since you had backup.

29:38.419 --> 29:41.012
Are you kidding, Castle?
Your daughter?

29:41.032 --> 29:43.523
When you say it in that tone,
I sound like a bad parent.

29:43.557 --> 29:45.825
Regardless,
Dr. Lillstrom is a suspect.

29:45.860 --> 29:47.059
- Trust me.
- Fine.

29:49.129 --> 29:50.363
Thanks.

29:51.631 --> 29:53.432
There's protocol. You know that.

29:53.466 --> 29:55.667
If you had a lead,
you should have called us.

29:55.702 --> 29:57.703
Oh, believe me, I wanted to,
but they locked us up in a cell.

29:57.737 --> 29:59.038
No, I mean, you should
have called us be...

29:59.072 --> 30:01.407
wait, they locked you up?

30:01.441 --> 30:02.508
You know what? Never mind.
I don't want to know.

30:02.542 --> 30:05.244
Just go find Ryan and Espo
and take them to the prison.

30:06.894 --> 30:08.747
That man is insane.

30:08.782 --> 30:10.216
I'm innocent.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.583
If he says you're a suspect,

30:11.618 --> 30:13.386
then trust me...
you are far from innocent.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.353
Let's go.

30:14.388 --> 30:16.488
This way, guys.

30:18.825 --> 30:20.091
Oh, no.

30:22.161 --> 30:23.962
Oh, no, no, no, no!

30:34.808 --> 30:36.442
I told them to stay.

30:36.476 --> 30:38.276
They're not dogs, Castle.
They're college kids.

30:38.311 --> 30:39.577
What did you expect?

30:39.611 --> 30:41.779
This place has been
completely cleared out.

30:41.814 --> 30:44.322
Dr. Lillstrom must have had
a contingency plan.

30:44.508 --> 30:47.785
They took all the evidence.

30:47.820 --> 30:49.620
And I let it happen.

30:51.490 --> 30:54.525
All because
I wanted to impress Beckett.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.242
Sorry, Beckett. I screwed up.

30:58.262 --> 30:59.786
Yeah, you did.

31:00.614 --> 31:04.044
And I jeopardized
the entire case.

31:04.064 --> 31:05.652
Again, yes.

31:07.290 --> 31:07.826
But you know what?

31:07.860 --> 31:09.794
If it wasn't for you,
then we'd still be thinking

31:09.829 --> 31:13.230
that Peter's prison uniform
was a Halloween costume.

31:14.433 --> 31:16.000
So, I've been digging into
Dr. Lillstrom.

31:16.034 --> 31:18.002
Did you know that
for the past decade,

31:18.036 --> 31:21.221
she's been contracting
with the army, working psy ops?

31:21.952 --> 31:22.738
Wait a minute.

31:22.758 --> 31:24.442
The Navy funded the first,

31:24.476 --> 31:26.377
the original Stanford Prison experiment.

31:26.411 --> 31:27.311
Maybe the army is behind

31:27.346 --> 31:28.980
Dr. Lillstrom's
modern-day incarnation.

31:29.014 --> 31:31.115
That would explain how the place
was scrubbed so quickly.

31:31.149 --> 31:33.451
Now, why would the military
be interested

31:33.485 --> 31:35.786
in a bunch of college students
playing prison?

31:35.820 --> 31:37.388
Well,
the government's in need of

31:37.422 --> 31:38.889
new counterterrorism techniques

31:38.923 --> 31:40.624
aimed at
the millennial generation

31:40.658 --> 31:43.647
how to get into the minds of
young terrorists and break them.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.260
And what better source
of lab rats

31:45.280 --> 31:46.897
than the millennials
here at home?

31:46.931 --> 31:48.599
But we'll never get
those surveillance tapes back.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.433
So how do we prove that
Lillstrom left the prison

31:50.468 --> 31:53.003
to kill Peter after he escaped?

31:53.037 --> 31:54.879
We need a confession.

31:56.865 --> 31:59.309
Well, the doc likes mind games,
right?

32:02.847 --> 32:04.581
Charge me or let me go.

32:06.973 --> 32:07.784
Which sounds better...

32:07.819 --> 32:09.987
negligent infliction
of emotional distress,

32:10.021 --> 32:13.244
or gross psychological abuse?

32:13.264 --> 32:14.361
What are you doing?

32:14.381 --> 32:16.860
I'm writing an e-mail
to the entire Hud U. Faculty.

32:16.895 --> 32:17.961
Figured I'd let everyone know

32:17.996 --> 32:20.597
that you were conducting
an unauthorized experiment

32:20.632 --> 32:21.965
with members
of the student body,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.766
secretly funded
by the U.S. military.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.200
I'd love to see you prove it,

32:25.235 --> 32:27.503
especially because
every participating student

32:27.538 --> 32:29.138
signs a nondisclosure agreement.

32:29.172 --> 32:31.974
Oh. Well, then, I suppose
you won't mind if I send this.

32:32.009 --> 32:33.643
Wait! Wait.

32:36.218 --> 32:39.511
What will it take for you not to
tell anyone at Hudson about this?

32:39.531 --> 32:40.783
The truth.

32:40.817 --> 32:42.981
Do I have your word, captain?

32:43.229 --> 32:45.289
Hud U. will never hear from me.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.044
Okay.

32:47.064 --> 32:50.117
I didn't kill Peter, and
I wasn't sleeping with him.

32:50.589 --> 32:52.326
That's all you got?

32:53.530 --> 32:54.496
Well, then I'm sending it.

32:54.531 --> 32:55.565
Look, it's the truth!

32:55.599 --> 32:58.668
The night Peter escaped,
I wasn't even at the prison.

32:58.702 --> 32:59.902
Then where were you?

32:59.937 --> 33:02.471
A pipe burst in my apartment.
I was dealing with it all night.

33:02.505 --> 33:04.330
Check with my doorman.

33:05.007 --> 33:06.041
But if you're thinking

33:06.076 --> 33:10.045
whoever was having an affair
with Peter killed him...

33:10.509 --> 33:12.177
I might be able to help.

33:12.197 --> 33:14.058
Now we're talking.

33:17.347 --> 33:21.323
My study deals with extracting
secrets from unwilling subjects.

33:21.357 --> 33:24.893
And Peter revealed
that he was having an affair?

33:24.927 --> 33:27.178
So, who was he sleeping with?

33:28.046 --> 33:30.004
Someone on that list.

33:32.833 --> 33:35.869
Dean Feller, I'm sure
you know why you're here.

33:35.904 --> 33:36.737
Actually, I don't.

33:36.771 --> 33:39.707
Well, we found
the studio apartment.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.344
I don't... I don't know
w-what that is.

33:43.378 --> 33:44.860
Really?

33:44.880 --> 33:47.181
Because we showed your photo
to the neighbors.

33:47.216 --> 33:48.849
- They were able to tell us that...
- Okay.

33:48.883 --> 33:51.952
Look. Peter stood me up
a couple of nights in a row.

33:51.987 --> 33:54.855
And I was hurt,
so I wrote him a message.

33:54.889 --> 33:57.891
Peter stood you up
because he was trapped

33:57.926 --> 34:00.748
inside of Dr. Lillstrom's
prison experiment.

34:01.071 --> 34:02.529
What prison experiment?

34:02.563 --> 34:04.732
Peter told you about the hell
that he was stuck in.

34:04.766 --> 34:06.934
Phone records show
that you received a collect call

34:06.968 --> 34:08.534
from a payphone
near the crime scene.

34:08.569 --> 34:11.105
Yes, Peter called me.
He was panicked.

34:11.139 --> 34:12.447
He told me
to pick him up at the park

34:12.467 --> 34:13.572
and he would explain everything,

34:13.608 --> 34:15.708
but he never said anything
about a prison.

34:15.744 --> 34:16.944
He never showed.

34:16.978 --> 34:18.045
Did Peter tell you

34:18.079 --> 34:20.761
that Dr. Lillstrom extracted
the secret of your affair?

34:20.781 --> 34:21.639
Is that why you killed him?

34:21.659 --> 34:24.643
Because he was the only one
who could verify the truth?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.085
What?

34:26.121 --> 34:27.820
I didn't kill Peter.

34:28.324 --> 34:30.156
I want a lawyer right now.

34:37.764 --> 34:40.132
You're not buying this, are you?

34:40.167 --> 34:42.101
No confession. No smoking gun.

34:42.136 --> 34:45.071
It's just... Not clean.

34:45.105 --> 34:47.739
Well, that's how homicides are
sometimes.

34:47.775 --> 34:49.108
You know that.

34:49.143 --> 34:50.309
Yeah, but something's
still bothering me.

34:50.342 --> 34:53.079
There's a part of the mystery
that hasn't been solved yet.

34:53.112 --> 34:55.612
We're missing part of the story.

34:55.648 --> 34:58.116
And how do you suggest
we find it?

34:58.724 --> 35:00.652
The same way we always do.

35:00.687 --> 35:03.030
We start at the beginning,
back at the prison.

35:03.856 --> 35:06.024
You just want an excuse
to get me alone.

35:06.059 --> 35:08.741
No, Beckett,
I just want the truth.

35:09.436 --> 35:11.997
What really happened to Peter
that night.

35:16.859 --> 35:20.105
Peter was placed in this cell.

35:20.139 --> 35:22.006
And then he escaped.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.341
Yeah, but how?

35:23.375 --> 35:26.010
They said one morning
he was just gone.

35:26.857 --> 35:28.040
So, what are you thinking?

35:28.060 --> 35:31.282
How Peter escaped had something
to do with who killed him?

35:31.317 --> 35:33.384
Only one way to figure it out.

35:36.026 --> 35:37.582
And guess what.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.790
We're gonna figure it out
together.

35:43.853 --> 35:45.487
You're not gonna
get a signal.

35:45.521 --> 35:48.424
- You trapped me in here on purpose.
- No, I didn't.

35:48.444 --> 35:49.602
But since you brought it up,
tell me...

35:49.622 --> 35:51.559
why do you feel trapped
in our marriage?

35:51.593 --> 35:52.866
I don't.

35:52.886 --> 35:54.413
Then why did you leave?

35:55.480 --> 35:56.648
It's complicated.

35:56.668 --> 35:58.266
So is breaking out of a prison,

35:58.300 --> 35:59.901
so we've got some time.

35:59.935 --> 36:01.903
You know what? We're not having
this conversation.

36:01.937 --> 36:02.936
I asked you for space,

36:02.971 --> 36:05.973
and you literally locked me up
in a jail cell.

36:06.007 --> 36:07.007
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. Okay.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.641
You... I'll give you space.
I'll give you space.

36:08.676 --> 36:10.081
You know what?

36:10.101 --> 36:12.489
You know, it would be just my luck
it would ricochet and hit you

36:12.509 --> 36:14.574
and then I'd have two murders
to contend with.

36:14.594 --> 36:15.765
Look, relax.

36:15.785 --> 36:19.133
Peter broke out of here,
so... So can we.

36:19.153 --> 36:20.186
Probably.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.321
You're right.

36:21.355 --> 36:23.890
I mean, we've been stuck
in worse places together before.

36:23.924 --> 36:26.025
I like that word... together.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.828
So what happened, Kate?
What did I do wrong?

36:28.862 --> 36:30.989
Castle,
this one's not about you.

36:31.009 --> 36:32.331
It's on me.

36:33.074 --> 36:34.439
I love you.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.869
I always will.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.371
Then let's work it out...
therapy, counseling.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.979
Whatever it takes.

36:41.177 --> 36:42.641
I... I just can't.

36:42.676 --> 36:43.895
Why?

36:47.022 --> 36:47.814
Huh.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.214
"Huh," what?

36:49.248 --> 36:51.317
Before this place
was a prison cell,

36:51.351 --> 36:52.384
it was an office building,
right?

36:52.419 --> 36:53.385
Yeah.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.820
Take a look up.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.691
I bet you
that's how Peter got out.

36:58.725 --> 37:00.492
Come on, Castle.

37:09.369 --> 37:12.103
Uh, this is when
you boost me up.

37:12.138 --> 37:13.572
Uh, right. Up.

37:15.908 --> 37:18.909
Ready. There we go.

37:18.944 --> 37:20.845
Uh, okay.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.449
Oh, got it.

37:36.469 --> 37:38.329
Whew.

37:42.862 --> 37:45.902
You're doing great, honey.
N-not to rush you, but...

37:52.410 --> 37:55.412
Wait a minute.
Something's not right here.

37:55.446 --> 37:58.715
How did Peter reach the vent
from inside the cell?

38:03.024 --> 38:05.088
It was a two-man job.

38:05.122 --> 38:06.622
Two prisoners escaped,

38:06.656 --> 38:09.125
but only one was missing,
which means...

38:09.159 --> 38:10.929
The killer came back!

38:14.598 --> 38:16.499
I'll open the door.

38:17.534 --> 38:19.802
Thanks for coming down
to the station, Emily.

38:19.836 --> 38:23.239
We just have a few questions
about the prison experiment...

38:24.658 --> 38:26.776
and how you helped Peter
escape from it.

38:27.463 --> 38:29.077
What are you talking about?

38:29.112 --> 38:31.680
Well, Peter reached through
the bars, and he hoisted you up,

38:31.715 --> 38:33.482
and you both escaped,
didn't you?

38:33.517 --> 38:35.484
And then you killed Peter
in the park

38:35.519 --> 38:37.686
and returned to the prison,
to your cell...

38:37.721 --> 38:39.087
the perfect alibi.

38:39.122 --> 38:40.989
That's ridiculous.
Why would I kill him?

38:41.024 --> 38:42.691
Emily, we know about
the scholarship.

38:42.726 --> 38:44.427
You needed it to stay in school.

38:44.461 --> 38:45.594
Yeah,
but he won fair and square.

38:45.629 --> 38:47.095
We know that's not true.

38:47.130 --> 38:48.130
Peter won that scholarship

38:48.164 --> 38:50.132
because he was having an affair
with the Dean.

38:50.166 --> 38:51.434
And then when you found out
about it in the prison,

38:51.468 --> 38:52.535
you took your revenge.

38:52.569 --> 38:53.431
It wasn't me.

38:53.451 --> 38:56.143
- Stop lying, Emily!
- It wasn't!

38:56.163 --> 38:57.740
It was a different me!

38:59.233 --> 39:01.889
That experiment
messed with my head!

39:01.909 --> 39:05.547
After we escaped,
I just... snapped.

39:05.581 --> 39:07.510
It was so unfair.

39:07.530 --> 39:10.652
I had worked so hard,
did everything right.

39:11.283 --> 39:14.155
When Peter ran into the park,

39:14.189 --> 39:15.790
I-I went after him.

39:18.761 --> 39:20.829
Then I saw that tree branch.

39:23.398 --> 39:25.733
Why did I do that?

39:53.395 --> 39:55.075
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah.

39:55.095 --> 39:59.633
I finished piecing this together
for our investigation.

40:04.406 --> 40:06.374
You're having second thoughts.

40:06.408 --> 40:08.058
Aren't you?

40:08.078 --> 40:09.801
Yeah. I just knew that
this was gonna be tough.

40:09.821 --> 40:11.948
I didn't think it
was gonna be like this.

40:11.968 --> 40:14.447
I get it. I do.

40:15.067 --> 40:18.519
Look, maybe we need to stop
before we start.

40:18.553 --> 40:21.061
Beckett, I'll follow your lead.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.914
What should we do?

40:34.769 --> 40:36.403
Let's get to work.

40:42.950 --> 40:44.600
That is...

40:44.960 --> 40:46.646
50-year-old scotch.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.228
Yeah. I bought a case of it.

40:48.248 --> 40:50.049
Alexis, that's expensive.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.884
Relax, dad.
The company paid for it.

40:51.919 --> 40:52.869
Oh, okay.

40:52.889 --> 40:54.587
W-wait.
That means I paid for it.

40:55.656 --> 40:57.657
To closing the case.

40:57.691 --> 40:59.858
To generous expense accounts.

41:04.116 --> 41:06.765
So, any progress with Beckett?

41:07.306 --> 41:13.572
You know, at the prison,
we, um, sort of had a moment.

41:13.606 --> 41:15.107
Really?

41:15.809 --> 41:16.948
Yeah.

41:18.152 --> 41:20.907
I think my plan is working.

41:21.503 --> 41:23.587
I mean, it has to, right?

41:30.404 --> 41:32.340
Um, you know what?

41:32.360 --> 41:35.193
We're gonna start a tradition.

41:35.984 --> 41:37.896
For when we solve a case
together.

41:40.826 --> 41:43.534
I don't smoke,
and neither do you.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.641
Who said anything about smoking?
