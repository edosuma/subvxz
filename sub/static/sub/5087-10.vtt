WEBVTT

00:09.167 --> 00:10.867
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:10.967 --> 00:11.900
But is it any good?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.267
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.367 --> 00:15.067
but I don't review food,

00:15.167 --> 00:16.100
books, or movies.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.000
I review life itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.600
[screams]

00:19.700 --> 00:21.533
[triumphant music]

00:21.633 --> 00:22.433
[parrot squawks]

00:22.533 --> 00:26.800
*

00:26.900 --> 00:28.033
Over here.

00:28.133 --> 00:32.233
*

00:34.033 --> 00:36.100
Hello,
and welcome to Review.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.200
I'm Forrest MacNeil,
still reviewing life experiences

00:38.300 --> 00:42.400
despite having a real rough go
of it lately.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
In case you missed it,
a viewer

00:43.600 --> 00:47.700
recently asked me to kill
someone, and...

00:47.800 --> 00:49.167
now, a man is dead.

00:49.267 --> 00:50.467
(A.J.)
But look on the bright side.

00:50.567 --> 00:51.300
You're not going to jail
for murder.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.400
Well,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.533
I wish that were a bright side
that I could look on,

00:55.633 --> 00:59.767
but I--I actually--I
may be going to jail for murder.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.800
Right now, I'm just out on bail,
awaiting trial, so...

01:02.900 --> 01:03.967
Well, okay.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.533
But look on
another bright side.

01:06.633 --> 01:10.900
Being out on bail means
you get to do more reviews.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.367
Oh, yeah.

01:12.467 --> 01:16.700
Our next review comes
from Nicole in Mansfield, Ohio.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.233
"My neighbor made herself
an outfit from a trash can

01:18.333 --> 01:21.067
"and mumbles
about the CIA all the time.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.267
"She seems really happy,
but it's hard to tell for sure.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.633
What's it like to believe
in a conspiracy theory?"

01:27.733 --> 01:29.133
Okay.

01:29.233 --> 01:34.067
What's it like to believe
in a conspiracy theory?

01:34.100 --> 01:35.633
All right.

01:35.733 --> 01:37.767
(Forrest voice-over)
My first step was to attend
a lecture

01:37.867 --> 01:40.333
by a controversial author.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.933
I was clearly entering a world
of fear, obsession,

01:44.067 --> 01:45.333
and probably madness.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.633
(man)
Airplane mode is a joke.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.433
It is a dangerous time

01:49.533 --> 01:54.200
because the Illuminati is
coming up with various methods

01:54.300 --> 01:58.200
to bring about
the Fourth Reich.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.467
Controlling the weather,

01:59.567 --> 02:04.367
detonating underwater nukes
to cause tsunamis.

02:04.467 --> 02:07.267
(Forrest voice-over)
Listening to this man
ascribe all the word's tragedies

02:07.367 --> 02:09.533
to a shadowy
underground network,

02:09.633 --> 02:13.567
I began to grasp the appeal
of believing in conspiracies.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.267
Perhaps it would be nice
to think that life's misfortunes

02:16.367 --> 02:17.067
aren't simply random,

02:17.100 --> 02:18.733
but are instead the work

02:18.833 --> 02:21.600
of a villain who can be
smoked out and defeated.

02:21.700 --> 02:28.233
Which brings us
to the Interdimensional Bigfoot.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.367
(Forrest)
I understand better than anyone

02:29.467 --> 02:32.900
that the randomness
of life can be scary.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.433
Thanks to this television show,

02:34.533 --> 02:37.733
my entire existence
is given over to random chance.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.167
Gina, from Toluca Lake
has a question.

02:40.267 --> 02:41.267
What would it be
like to kill a person?

02:41.367 --> 02:43.467
What's it
like to be a cult leader?

02:43.567 --> 02:45.733
What's it like
to be kicked in the balls?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.367
And when you really
think about it,

02:47.467 --> 02:48.933
things
haven't always gone so well.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.100
[gunfire]
Ah!

02:50.200 --> 02:52.233
I am infested with sea lice!

02:52.333 --> 02:56.100
[screaming]

02:56.200 --> 02:57.300
[gagging]

02:57.400 --> 02:58.700
I'm having a heart attack,
you guys.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.400
Ow!
[screaming]

03:01.500 --> 03:02.800
Maybe it would feel
better to believe

03:02.900 --> 03:05.667
that the difficult experiences
I've had on this show

03:05.767 --> 03:09.533
were not the product
of pure blind, random chance.

03:09.633 --> 03:10.867
Is there any reason
to think that something else

03:10.967 --> 03:13.067
might be going on?

03:13.133 --> 03:18.233
Well, let's find out.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.067
Mm-hmm.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.100
Wow.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.633
Yeah.

03:27.733 --> 03:30.667
That's a lot
of dangerous reviews, isn't it?

03:30.767 --> 03:32.267
Look at how many times
I've almost died.

03:32.367 --> 03:35.600
I mean, that's really
surprising to me.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.567
It's 11 times.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.600
I've almost died 11 times?

03:37.700 --> 03:39.267
Oh, my God.
It's so many.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.400
No, that's a lot
of times.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.167
That's a lot of times
to almost die.

03:42.267 --> 03:43.133
I'm looking at this,

03:43.233 --> 03:45.400
and I'm thinking to myself,

03:45.500 --> 03:46.333
"When you consider
all the dangerous things

03:46.433 --> 03:50.067
that I've been asked
to do...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.067
How can that be random?"

03:55.133 --> 03:58.500
[suspenseful music]

03:58.600 --> 03:59.733
Can that really be random?

03:59.833 --> 04:01.600
Maybe somebody's trying
to kill you.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.533
(Forrest voice-over)
The suggestion
was ridiculous and silly.

04:03.633 --> 04:05.067
- No, but...
- And yet...

04:05.100 --> 04:07.067
What is going on? I mean
that's an incredible list.

04:07.167 --> 04:11.733
[Tina sighs]

04:11.833 --> 04:13.833
(Josh)
I mean, like,
maybe it's just,

04:13.933 --> 04:16.433
like, cool stuff.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.833
Oh, somebody definitely
wants to kill you.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.100
That's a bummer.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
- Have a good one.
- We'll miss you.

04:22.300 --> 04:22.800
- Yeah.
- Don't do anything dangerous.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.600
[chuckles]

04:34.067 --> 04:35.667
Good night.

04:35.767 --> 04:40.533
I'm gonna go too.
Good night, Forrest.

04:40.633 --> 04:45.533
My producer, Grant, oversees
every aspect of this show,

04:45.633 --> 04:48.067
and he has assured me that
the Review selection process

04:48.167 --> 04:49.300
is totally random,

04:49.400 --> 04:52.833
but I'm starting
to wonder about that now.

04:52.933 --> 04:54.500
[suspenseful music]

04:54.600 --> 04:56.967
What if Grant has chosen
all of the assignments

04:57.067 --> 05:00.233
that have hurt me so much?

05:00.333 --> 05:01.433
I need to know if that's true.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.600
[jiggling doorknob]

05:08.233 --> 05:08.867
[grunts]

05:08.967 --> 05:12.100
[crash]

05:12.200 --> 05:14.367
Come on.

05:14.467 --> 05:17.933
*

05:18.067 --> 05:20.333
Well, you certainly learn a lot
about a person

05:20.433 --> 05:22.267
when you ransack their office.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.367
Grant takes three different
kinds of fish oil supplement.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.100
Seems like an awful lot
of fish oil.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.433
He also subscribes to a magazine
here that seems to be nothing

05:30.533 --> 05:33.100
but photos
of antiquated medical equipment.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.733
I think that's real weird,

05:35.833 --> 05:37.367
but this
is what really interests me.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.400
This is called
the "Submissions Master List."

05:39.500 --> 05:40.800
Now, this is a list of hundreds

05:40.900 --> 05:42.433
of Review topics that have been
sent in to the show.

05:42.533 --> 05:45.400
"What's it like to fall in love
with a snowman?"

05:45.500 --> 05:46.800
"What's it
like to name a dolphin?"

05:46.900 --> 05:51.333
Now, every single one that
I have done is circled here.

05:51.433 --> 05:52.700
I believe this is the document

05:52.800 --> 05:57.067
from which Grant chose all
of the reviews that I have done.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.800
This is the smoking gun.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.567
(Forrest voice-over)
But the more time
I spent looking into Review,

06:01.667 --> 06:04.133
the more questions I had.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.967
Okay.
Here's the problem.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.600
Grant choosing all the reviews
does not explain

06:07.700 --> 06:10.267
all the terrible things
that have happened to me.

06:10.367 --> 06:11.667
Look at this.

06:11.767 --> 06:12.900
"What's it like to spend a night
at a haunted house?"

06:13.067 --> 06:16.067
That got me stabbed
in the belly by an old lady.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.167
[screaming]

06:18.267 --> 06:20.267
Why did that happen?

06:20.367 --> 06:21.800
Or this, here.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.667
"What's it like to spend
an afternoon on a rowboat?"

06:23.767 --> 06:25.933
Like, that should've
been a delightful experience,

06:26.067 --> 06:26.667
but I fell asleep,

06:26.767 --> 06:28.100
and my oars disappeared.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.133
Where are the oars?

06:29.233 --> 06:32.400
So either I am
the unluckiest person

06:32.500 --> 06:33.933
in the world,

06:34.067 --> 06:38.567
or Grant is not just
choosing these reviews.

06:38.667 --> 06:42.067
What if he's orchestrating
everything?

06:42.167 --> 06:43.200
And I got another problem.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.300
When I was buried alive here
for 24 hours,

06:47.400 --> 06:48.367
I almost died
because Josh and Tina

06:48.467 --> 06:49.733
forgot where they buried me.

06:49.833 --> 06:52.100
How do you forget
where you buried a living man?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.400
I got to get out of here!

06:54.500 --> 06:56.933
They're in on it.

06:57.067 --> 06:59.233
And so is Lucille.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.067
Jesus [bleep] Christ.

07:02.167 --> 07:03.567
Holy [bleep].

07:03.667 --> 07:06.600
Jesus [bleep].

07:06.700 --> 07:09.233
Jesus [bleep] Christ!

07:09.333 --> 07:11.700
It's a conspiracy.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.067
Hi. I need a room.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.733
I need a quiet room
in the back, okay?

07:17.833 --> 07:21.067
Hey, if anybody calls,
I'm not here, you understand?

07:21.167 --> 07:22.833
(Forrest voice-over)
I could no longer
sleep in my office

07:22.933 --> 07:24.467
as there was glass everywhere,

07:24.567 --> 07:26.067
and I believed my coworkers

07:26.167 --> 07:29.267
were conspiring to kill me
on national television,

07:29.367 --> 07:31.800
so I holed up
in a remote roadside motel

07:31.900 --> 07:34.700
to carefully think things
through

07:34.800 --> 07:37.567
over a period
of several days and nights.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.933
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, [bleep].

07:40.067 --> 07:42.067
Oh, [bleep].
Oh, [bleep].

07:42.133 --> 07:45.167
There. See that?
See, the fire extinguisher

07:45.267 --> 07:46.900
was just out of my reach, just
past where I could reach it,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.867
and then the house
burned down because of that.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.900
Was Grant able to see me
as a little person and figure

07:52.067 --> 07:53.200
out how high I could reach
and then go to my dad's house

07:53.300 --> 07:55.367
and say, "Okay, I'll put
the fire extinguisher right here

07:55.467 --> 07:57.300
"so his little hands

07:57.400 --> 07:59.833
can only reach that high
and not reach it"?

08:00.067 --> 08:00.733
And this is me.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.067
I'm sadder than that.

08:02.167 --> 08:05.300
What kind of a monster
would make my dad homeless

08:05.400 --> 08:08.300
for a television show?
That son of a bitch.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.067
(Forrest voice-over)
Grant was obviously
behind everything.

08:11.167 --> 08:15.767
Every bad thing
that happened was him.

08:15.867 --> 08:16.967
Of course, of course.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.767
(woman)
Forrest, I've often wondered.

08:18.867 --> 08:21.100
What would it be
like to kill a person?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.100
My question is what would it be
like to kill a person?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.533
[click]
To kill a person.

08:25.633 --> 08:28.433
(Forrest voice-over)
The truth
I now knew was so huge,

08:28.533 --> 08:30.100
I could not bear it alone.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.433
I would need to visit
my ex-wife, Suzanne,

08:31.533 --> 08:32.567
at her mother's house.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.167
I would need to get help.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.933
I haven't been to the bathroom
in 14 hours.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.167
Don't let anybody in the door.

08:40.267 --> 08:41.500
- Forrest, go away!
- Okay.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.067
I just--I have something
that I need to explain to you

08:44.133 --> 08:47.067
that's gonna change absolutely
everything, okay? Just please.

08:47.167 --> 08:52.933
Please, this is the last thing
I will ever ask of you.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.500
- What is all this?
- This is all gonna

08:54.600 --> 08:55.967
help you understand
what's happening, okay?

08:56.067 --> 08:58.167
- Great. Come on in.
- All right. There's a lot

08:58.267 --> 08:59.900
to walk you through here,
and all of it is important,

09:00.067 --> 09:01.433
and it's hard
to know where to start.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.367
The first clue that I had that
something was wrong was this.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.067
This is a list
of every single review

09:05.133 --> 09:06.567
that has ever been
sent in to the show,

09:06.667 --> 09:08.567
and all of the ones
that I've done are circled.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.067
Do you know who circled them?

09:10.133 --> 09:10.867
- Grant?
- Yes, exactly.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.100
He told me it was all random.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.267
Keep your voice down,
please.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.867
You're gonna wake
up Eric and my mom.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.333
(Forrest voice-over)
I laid out all of my evidence
to Suzanne.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.433
All the pain.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.067
My review of having
a perfect body, okay?

09:21.167 --> 09:22.333
Oh, [bleep].
What is this?

09:22.433 --> 09:23.933
And my penis has never been
the same since then.

09:24.067 --> 09:25.300
No. [bleep].
Is it still like that?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.100
I had the thing taken out,
but it's still weird.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.067
It's like there's too much skin
now 'cause the implant came out.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.667
Let me just show it to you
so you have a sense of--

09:31.767 --> 09:32.600
Move on!
I don't want to see it.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.967
Fine. All right.
Fine, fine, fine.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.067
I don't think that that was
any normal magic eight ball.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.933
I think Grant
was controlling it.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.767
- Okay.
- Why did a pillow fight

09:38.867 --> 09:40.367
have to become so violent?

09:40.467 --> 09:42.367
And it turned into
a [bleep] bloodbath.

09:42.467 --> 09:45.267
This was supposed
to be a show about life, okay?

09:45.367 --> 09:48.867
Grant turned it into a show
about death. My death.

09:48.967 --> 09:50.367
That's what's happening here.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.900
And so I'm gonna tell him
I have figured it out.

09:53.067 --> 09:53.967
This is not what I signed on
for, and I am out of here,

09:54.067 --> 09:56.933
and I'm going back to my wife
and my kid,

09:57.067 --> 09:57.967
and I'm going back
to my old life.

09:58.067 --> 09:59.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forrest,

10:00.067 --> 10:00.967
I think it's really simple.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.467
You signed on to
an insane television show,

10:04.567 --> 10:07.667
and then you constantly
put that show above your needs

10:07.767 --> 10:09.967
and the people
that you love.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.333
I'm just not seeing
this evil plan.

10:13.433 --> 10:17.333
The only person that you need
to be afraid of is yourself.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.167
Oh.
[scoffs]

10:19.267 --> 10:22.533
I'm gonna prove I'm right,
and then I'll be back!

10:22.633 --> 10:26.367
(Forrest voice-over)
If I was going to convince
Suzanne of my conspiracy theory,

10:26.467 --> 10:27.967
there was one more thing
I needed to know.

10:28.067 --> 10:31.933
Why? Why was Grant
trying to destroy me?

10:32.033 --> 10:34.900
What had I ever done to him?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.600
This question plunged me deeper
into the darkness

10:37.700 --> 10:42.067
where I made a shocking
and upsetting discovery.

10:42.167 --> 10:47.867
I've been doing some research
here on HTML, ww.google.com.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.333
There's no trace of Grant
anywhere on the internet

10:49.433 --> 10:51.567
prior to 1995.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.633
It's like he does not exist.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.433
Now, 1995 happens to be
the same year

10:55.533 --> 10:57.667
that this woman supposedly
married a Chinese guy

10:57.767 --> 11:00.633
and disappeared to Hong Kong.

11:00.733 --> 11:03.600
This is Gretchen Edelberg,
and she had a really big crush

11:03.700 --> 11:04.933
on Suzanne when we
were all in college together.

11:05.067 --> 11:06.867
You see where I'm going
with this?

11:06.967 --> 11:09.867
Gretchen, okay, Grant.

11:09.967 --> 11:10.567
Gretchen, Grant.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.733
Gruh, Gruh, Gruh.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.867
She didn't move to Hong Kong.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.267
She got a sex change.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.933
He loves Suzanne so much,
after all this time,

11:21.067 --> 11:22.933
that he's gone
completely crazy.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.200
Get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

11:25.300 --> 11:27.067
(Forrest voice-over)
Now that everything
finally made sense,

11:27.167 --> 11:28.933
it was time to confront
the monster in his lair.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.333
Of course
he's not gonna open that gate

11:31.433 --> 11:33.200
because he knows
that I know the truth,

11:33.300 --> 11:34.433
and he's too much
of a [bleep] coward.

11:34.533 --> 11:37.600
Hey, you're too much
of a [bleep] coward

11:37.700 --> 11:40.633
to look me in the eye--
oh, [bleep, bleep]!

11:40.733 --> 11:42.067
Oh, God.
All right.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.867
Come on.
Let's go.

11:43.967 --> 11:45.867
- You [bleep] monster.
- Forrest.

11:45.967 --> 11:46.800
I know everything now.
[bleep].

11:46.900 --> 11:49.900
- What a nice surprise.
- No.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.533
- The guy's will bring it in.
- Ah, [bleep].

11:51.633 --> 11:53.267
I've figured it all out,
and I'm quitting the show!

11:53.367 --> 11:55.233
Again?

11:55.333 --> 11:56.067
Everything you've tried
to hide from me

11:56.100 --> 11:58.067
is out in the open now.

11:58.167 --> 12:01.500
You've ruined my life
for the last time, Gretchen.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.533
You bitch.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.067
This should be good.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.533
(Forrest voice-over)
I wasted no time

12:10.633 --> 12:12.733
unleashing the full weight
of all my damning evidence.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.367
Feel the walls of deception

12:14.467 --> 12:16.933
that you've built up
around yourself crumbling.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.533
You're at your producer's
house. I'm Grant.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.867
- You remember who I am, right?
- [laughing] Oh, yeah.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.067
(Forrest voice-over)
I forced Grant

12:22.133 --> 12:24.167
to come face-to-face
with what I now knew.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.167
The submissions master list.

12:26.267 --> 12:30.133
I've seen how all the reviews
I've done are circled.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.133
Okay. This is a list
I went through last week

12:32.233 --> 12:36.533
of all the reviews
that we've done already,

12:36.633 --> 12:37.267
and I circled them.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.700
No.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.267
So I could tell
the IT guys

12:41.367 --> 12:43.333
to avoid any duplicates
because that time

12:43.433 --> 12:44.433
that murder came up again,

12:44.533 --> 12:48.733
I felt like
we'd let you down.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.267
Liar.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.800
Are you telling me this wasn't
one of your paid assassins?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.067
Are you serious?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.133
- How about that?
- Nope.

12:55.233 --> 12:55.567
That one
of your paid assassins?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.633
No.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.700
'Cause I know you did this.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.433
What is this a drawing of?

13:00.533 --> 13:03.200
(Forrest voice-over)
Grant demonstrated
incredible cool under pressure,

13:03.300 --> 13:05.300
offering sensible sounding
explanations for everything,

13:05.400 --> 13:09.467
but I saved my most
explosive accusation for last.

13:09.567 --> 13:10.900
There's one more picture
I want to show you.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.900
- Oh, great.
- This is the one

13:13.067 --> 13:14.500
you really don't want to see.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.800
- Oh, I want to see it.
- Because it's an old picture.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.967
It's an old picture...

13:19.067 --> 13:19.467
Let's see it.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.833
Of you.

13:21.933 --> 13:23.400
You were so pretty.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.433
- Now, who is this?
- Ooh, you're good.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.400
Was I cropped
out of this picture?

13:28.500 --> 13:31.267
You're Gretchen, and you
turned yourself into Grant.

13:31.367 --> 13:35.067
You went from this to this
to this.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.467
(Forrest voice-over)
Finally, the sheer weight
of my evidence wore Grant down.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.067
Okay, fine.

13:41.167 --> 13:43.267
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what's going on.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.067
No more hiding anything.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.067
Now, have a seat.
It's my turn to talk.

13:48.133 --> 13:50.533
(Forrest voice-over)
What he said next completely
blew my mind.

13:50.633 --> 13:57.233
People are constantly asking
you to review dangerous things

13:57.333 --> 14:01.233
because they already know
what the easy stuff is like.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.500
They can do that themselves.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.667
Living on the edge like this,
things will go wrong.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.433
People will get hurt,
and that is part

14:08.533 --> 14:12.800
of what we need you to help
us understand about life.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.333
I need you!

14:14.433 --> 14:17.633
Why would I want you dead?

14:17.733 --> 14:21.167
You know what?

14:21.267 --> 14:24.267
Besides all that,
I like you,

14:24.367 --> 14:26.167
and I know
I don't always show it,

14:26.267 --> 14:29.400
but the fact
is I consider you a friend.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.433
(Forrest voice-over)
By the time
Grant put the final nail

14:31.533 --> 14:33.433
in the coffin
of my conspiracy theory

14:33.533 --> 14:36.600
by showing me a photo
of himself growing up as a boy

14:36.700 --> 14:41.067
in the delightfully named town
of Sandwich, Massachusetts,

14:41.100 --> 14:42.967
it was not necessary.

14:43.067 --> 14:43.900
Sandwich, Massachusetts.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.867
That's what they called it.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.900
You were always a boy?

14:49.067 --> 14:50.300
[sobbing]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.100
- I'm really sorry.
- It's gonna be all right.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.467
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

14:55.567 --> 14:56.800
I'm just trying to hug you.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.633
Come here. Come here.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.833
I'm sorry.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.100
There we go.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.267
There we go.

15:04.367 --> 15:08.233
(Forrest voice-over)
Letting go of my conspiracy
theory was bittersweet.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.833
It's always nice to hear
that you're not the target

15:09.933 --> 15:12.067
of a murder plot,

15:12.167 --> 15:15.600
but I no longer had an easy
explanation for my miseries.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.833
As long
as I do this important work,

15:17.933 --> 15:18.900
I will suffer,

15:19.067 --> 15:22.500
and my old life
will remain in the past.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.600
But great men
have always made sacrifices,

15:25.700 --> 15:29.067
and I know that I, with the help
of my treasured viewers

15:29.167 --> 15:31.300
and making the world
a better place,

15:31.400 --> 15:33.667
one review at a time.

15:35.767 --> 15:40.767
People do sometimes conspire
and sometimes with bad intent,

15:40.867 --> 15:44.233
but to accuse anyone
of that on flimsy, outrageous,

15:44.333 --> 15:48.133
or bizarre evidence
is an act of great cruelty.

15:48.233 --> 15:53.067
So I would like to apologize
to my producer and best friend,

15:53.167 --> 15:54.200
Grant.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.733
I give believing
in a conspiracy theory

15:56.833 --> 16:01.200
half a star.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.267
A.J., do we have time
for one more review?

16:03.367 --> 16:05.767
- Yes.
- And what is that?

16:05.867 --> 16:09.467
This one comes from Miles
in Sandwich, Massachusetts.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.067
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.200
- Huh.
- Hey, Forrest,

16:12.300 --> 16:17.233
what's it like to be hunted?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.733
What's it like to be...
hunted?

16:19.833 --> 16:22.400
Yeah.

16:29.467 --> 16:33.233
What's it like to, uh...

16:33.333 --> 16:34.967
what's it like
to be hunted?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.567
I know it's possible I'm just
having some residual paranoia

16:43.667 --> 16:45.133
from my conspiracy theory
experience,

16:45.233 --> 16:46.200
but what is it
like to be hunted?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.500
And the person
asking this question

16:48.600 --> 16:49.833
is from Grant's hometown.

16:49.933 --> 16:52.233
Lucille, what is the population
of Sandwich,

16:52.333 --> 16:53.633
Massachusetts, please?

16:53.733 --> 16:55.267
You probably
shouldn't be here,

16:55.367 --> 16:59.300
'cause your hunter
knows where you work.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.700
What hunter?

17:00.800 --> 17:05.167
Grant asked me to hire
a former Navy seal to hunt you.

17:05.267 --> 17:08.467
What? Why?
What do you mean?

17:08.567 --> 17:10.067
You never do anything
like that without me

17:10.167 --> 17:11.667
specifically asking you to
please do something like that.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.067
- What is going on right now?
- Grant thought it would be best

17:14.100 --> 17:16.533
if I hired him so you

17:16.633 --> 17:19.233
wouldn't know what he looked
like or anything about him.

17:19.333 --> 17:19.867
Hey, Mr. MacNeil,
do you want us to help you

17:19.967 --> 17:20.933
hide or something?

17:21.067 --> 17:22.900
Or if he gets you,

17:23.067 --> 17:24.833
do you want us to bury you
in that same spot?

17:24.933 --> 17:27.767
And follow-up question:
do you remember where that was?

17:27.867 --> 17:30.067
Oh, my God.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.567
It's all true.

17:31.667 --> 17:35.067
You goddamn bunch of jackals
are really trying to kill me.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.400
Well, listen to me.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.600
I survived on garbage
in the middle of the ocean.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.233
I scratched my way
out of the grave.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.567
You think you can kill me?

17:41.667 --> 17:43.067
Nothing can kill me!

17:43.167 --> 17:45.200
- I'm not afraid of anything!
- Oh, my God. There he is!

17:45.300 --> 17:48.433
Aah!
[laughter]

17:48.533 --> 17:50.900
You [bleep] monsters!

17:51.067 --> 17:52.767
I've got to get out of this hell
you made for me.

17:52.867 --> 17:55.167
I'm gonna
do it [bleep] right now!

17:55.267 --> 17:57.400
Those are my keys.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.667
[suspenseful music]

18:00.767 --> 18:08.500
*

18:12.467 --> 18:14.267
Suzanne, I know now for sure.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.667
The show
is definitely trying to kill me,

18:15.767 --> 18:17.867
and I'm leaving it for real,
for good,

18:17.967 --> 18:18.900
and I'm coming to get you,
okay?

18:19.067 --> 18:20.967
I will explain it
when I get there.

18:21.067 --> 18:25.067
Hey, no! No! No!

18:25.133 --> 18:33.067
*

18:37.733 --> 18:39.433
Okay.
Are we rolling?

18:39.533 --> 18:41.167
'Cause there he is.
There he is.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.467
That's Forrest in the car

18:42.567 --> 18:44.600
that he stole
from his executive assistant,

18:44.700 --> 18:46.400
Lucille,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.067
and he's now approaching
a cameraman

18:48.167 --> 18:49.433
who I positioned there
in the road,

18:49.533 --> 18:51.433
and hopefully, the cameraman
won't frighten him.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.633
He's maintaining his pace,

18:52.733 --> 18:56.667
and he didn't frighten him,
so we're good.

18:56.767 --> 18:58.300
Okay.
I have positioned myself here

18:58.400 --> 18:59.567
because I figured
this would be

18:59.667 --> 19:02.333
the likeliest route
to Suzanne's mother's house.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.767
Forrest had
a little crisis of faith.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.433
He--he ran away from the show
yet again,

19:07.533 --> 19:10.800
and hopefully, I'll be able
to talk him down,

19:10.900 --> 19:12.167
and let's see
if we can work this out.

19:12.267 --> 19:14.367
We usually do.
Hi, buddy.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.533
Get out of the road, Gretchen,
or I swear, I will mow you down!

19:16.633 --> 19:17.900
[laughs] Gretchen.
Okay. Calm down.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.100
Let's talk about this.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.633
No. Just move your [bleep] car.
I'm out of here.

19:20.733 --> 19:22.567
That's it. No more of this!
I'm out of here for good!

19:22.667 --> 19:23.467
Let's calm down.
Just take a breath.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.367
"What is it like
to be hunted?"

19:25.467 --> 19:26.433
Oh, come on.
It's a random system.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.900
Oh, bull[bleep].

19:28.067 --> 19:30.300
You hired somebody
to hunt me down!

19:30.400 --> 19:32.567
I think you might be wrong
about the details.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.300
Really? Sandwich,
Massachusetts, huh?

19:34.400 --> 19:35.667
Sandwich, Massachusetts.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.500
- Explain that.
- That is a coincidence.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.933
- I haven't been there in years.
- Oh, really?

19:39.067 --> 19:40.667
I don't know anybody
from there anymore,

19:40.767 --> 19:41.800
and no one
is trying to kill you.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.833
Just another coincidence.
You got to think

19:43.933 --> 19:45.067
I'm the stupidest [bleep] person
in the world!

19:45.133 --> 19:47.333
- I think you're brilliant!
- Oh, really?

19:47.433 --> 19:49.133
- Forrest MacNeil!
- Oh, my God.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.833
Oh, my God!
Oh, [bleep]!

19:51.933 --> 19:53.300
Oh!

19:53.400 --> 19:55.500
If I'm gonna die,
you're gonna die too!

19:55.600 --> 19:58.067
- It's a blowgun!
- It's a what?

19:58.167 --> 19:59.067
[gun clacks]

19:59.133 --> 20:01.333
- [screaming]
- Oh, no!

20:01.433 --> 20:03.700
- [bleep] [bleep]
- Oh, my God.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.333
(man)
Oh, no. [bleep]

20:07.433 --> 20:12.600
- Oh, [bleep].
- [bleep]

20:23.767 --> 20:27.200
And so it seems
that another season of Review

20:27.300 --> 20:29.733
must end with me,
A.J. Gibbs,

20:29.833 --> 20:33.800
giving you the sad news that
Forrest MacNeil has vanished,

20:33.900 --> 20:39.600
and this time, with our beloved
producer, Grant Grunderschmidt.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.000
I don't like to be sad,

20:41.100 --> 20:43.833
so I like to think they're
floating down that river,

20:43.933 --> 20:46.467
settling their differences
with one another.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.067
And if I'm right about that,

20:48.167 --> 20:51.133
I'm pretty sure Forrest
would give being hunted

20:51.233 --> 20:55.700
six stars.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.433
That's all the time we have.

20:57.533 --> 20:59.367
This is A.J. Gibbs saying,

20:59.467 --> 21:01.067
"Life,
you're already living it.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.267
Ain't it great?"

21:03.367 --> 21:05.100
So long.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.500
(man)
Extra cheese.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.800
This is a list of hundreds

21:14.900 --> 21:16.167
of review topics that have been
sent in to the show.

21:16.267 --> 21:17.567
"What's it like to shake hands
with an old person?"

21:17.667 --> 21:19.567
"What's it
like to see an elephant?"

21:19.667 --> 21:21.300
"What's it like to shop
for bathing suits?"

21:21.400 --> 21:22.600
"What's it like
to join a club?"

21:22.700 --> 21:24.100
"What's it like to have
a yellow house?"

21:24.200 --> 21:25.733
"What's it like
to sing all day?"

21:25.833 --> 21:26.867
"What's it like to wear
someone else's pants?"
