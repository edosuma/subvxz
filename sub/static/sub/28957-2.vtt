ANNOUNCER: FX presentsSnowfall.

00:07.355 --> 00:09.313
-[straining]: Help...
-Matt? Hey, what hurts?

00:09.357 --> 00:12.186
-My, um...
-He's having a heart attack.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.317
TEDDY: I'll hire help for both of you.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.449
COLONEL:
What is so important

00:14.492 --> 00:15.841
that you can't clean up
your own mess?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.104
Certainly isn't looking after

00:17.147 --> 00:18.192
your own family.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.672
The DEA is on a rampage
down in Colombia.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.109
Thought you was immune
to that shit.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.676
I don't know what it is
you think you know, but I am

00:24.720 --> 00:27.418
the only reason that you are
breathing free air right now.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.290
12 units, all two-bedroom,
one-bath.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.509
FRANKLIN:We make an offer, it'll be cash.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.946
-This is the place.
-JULIA: We don't
work together anymore.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.297
We're certainly
not married anymore.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.168
TEDDY:
This thing blows up,
you won't be touched.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.691
But you let it be known
to whoever is behind this

00:39.735 --> 00:41.737
that I am not afraid
to make noise if I have to.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.869
And I have product that I need
to get across the border.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.176
I was hoping to use
Lucia's family farm

00:46.220 --> 00:47.525
-and their routes.
-Lucia's gone.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.092
She left months ago.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.137
Manboy here to see y'all.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.530
-Fuck you want here?
-I'm a businessman.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.532
It'd be in my interest to know
what the competition up to.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.318
Couple of my associates took
that notion a little too far.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.797
What, are you trying to rob us?

00:58.841 --> 01:00.103
MANBOY:
You'll give me
a chance to square us,

01:00.147 --> 01:01.539
if I get my product from y'all.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.758
ANDRE:
Now, this rock
that you're selling,

01:02.801 --> 01:04.542
it's doing real damage
out there.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.936
People are out there right now doing dirt on your behalf,

01:06.979 --> 01:10.722
making mistakes that
I'm gonna catch, one by one,

01:10.766 --> 01:14.465
from your friends
to your auntie to your mama.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.988
And when ain't nobody left,

01:16.032 --> 01:17.816
I'm gonna take you, too.

So you're sure the last time
you saw her was last night.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.137
SANTOS:
Yeah.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.966
Sarge.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.968
We thought you might want
to hear this.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.274
SANTOS:
It's just that

01:40.317 --> 01:41.971
Claudia didn't show up for work,

01:42.014 --> 01:45.192
wasn't answering her phone,
so I checked on her,

01:45.235 --> 01:47.194
found her here, overdosed.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.370
And that you weren't
the last one to see her.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.590
No. I let Louie in around 1:00,then I took off.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.986
Louie? Franklin Saint's auntie?

01:57.029 --> 01:58.248
Yeah.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.222
[birds chirping]

02:18.094 --> 02:20.096

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
[whispers]:
Hey, baby.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.759
Hmm? Mm...

02:30.802 --> 02:32.674
I didn't want to leave
without talking to you.

02:32.717 --> 02:36.112
[groans]
Just... I'm fine, baby.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.463
-I just need to rest. Go.
-Mm-hmm.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
Maybe I should stay home today.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.032
Mm-mm. Jerome, I'm for real.

02:43.075 --> 02:46.209
Just go. I just need to sleep.

02:46.253 --> 02:49.256
All right, baby,
I'll see you tonight.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.043
Why are we waiting?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.089
We should take her in.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.135
[indistinct radio chatter]

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
That's why.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.276
[car door closes, engine starts]

03:11.626 --> 03:13.628
Let's get her.

Los Angeles Police Department.

LAPD. Open up.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.435
[exhales]

03:57.324 --> 03:59.500
Look, I already told you
that shit was clean.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.415
Just me and Fatback, in and out.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.546
FRANKLIN:
You sure nobody saw you?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.200
Franklin, how the fuck
am I supposed

04:04.244 --> 04:05.897
to be sure about
some shit like that?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.943
I ain't been picked up yet,
so why you sweating me?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.945
'Cause Andre came at me
last night.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.425
Seems to have in his head

04:11.468 --> 04:13.514
that we a problem
that need to be dealt with.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.429
Well, ain't Andre had that
in his head for a while now?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.735
Not like this.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.433
They coming for us, man.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.999
Our people, our money.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.001
We got to be smarter,
protect ourselves.

04:23.045 --> 04:26.048
Come on.
[grunts]

04:28.703 --> 04:30.444
What's up, y'all?

04:30.487 --> 04:32.359
-We straight?
-Depends.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.404
You got the cash?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.509
[car door opens, closes]

04:55.643 --> 04:56.774
FRANKLIN:
Hold up.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.604
What's your plan?

05:00.648 --> 05:03.912
My plan? What you mean, my plan?

05:03.955 --> 05:05.566
I'm-a sell that rock.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.611
When it's gone, buy some more,

05:07.655 --> 05:09.526
-then I'm gonna sell that, too.-And expand?

05:09.570 --> 05:11.136
MANBOY:
Talking about staying
out of your territory,

05:11.180 --> 05:13.617
-I know what's what.
-You better make sure

05:13.661 --> 05:15.445
your crew
know that shit, too, then.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.360
FRANKLIN:
Hey.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.406
Remember back at Foshay,

05:19.449 --> 05:22.626
that food fight
that turned into a riot?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.715
Oh, yeah. That shit was crazy.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.022
-[chuckles]: Yeah.
-The fire alarms ringing.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.415
Shit, a couple motherfuckers

05:28.458 --> 05:30.417
went after their teachers
with their trays.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.636
Mm. Knocked that old
lunch lady out cold.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.551
-That lunch lady. Damn.
-You know,

05:34.595 --> 05:37.946
a few of us,
we knew to stay out the mess.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.514
Not to go after each other
or the teachers.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.038
Shit, I hopped that fence
and I was gone.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.606
[Franklin chuckles]

05:45.649 --> 05:47.564
Yeah.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.566
You know...

05:51.699 --> 05:53.396
...this shit?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.746
We stay out the mess.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.357
Yeah, I'm with you.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.099
[laughs softly]

06:01.143 --> 06:03.319
Holler when you want some more.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.148
Fo sho.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.197
That's cute.

06:12.241 --> 06:15.070
[car door opens]

06:21.729 --> 06:23.687
He really run away
from that fight?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.515
FRANKLIN:
Nah.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.083
He was the one that knocked outthe lunch lady.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.434
Fuck you, Andre!

06:31.478 --> 06:34.655
I want my goddamn lawyer
right fucking now!

06:34.698 --> 06:36.918
[shouts]

06:36.961 --> 06:38.963
[grunts, panting]

06:43.620 --> 06:47.319
We have her at the scene,but she lied about the timeline.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.017
All circumstantial.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.323
The last thing we need
is to put an OD

06:51.367 --> 06:53.325
on the board as a murder.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.806
Why don't you let it rest
until the ME report comes in?

06:55.850 --> 06:58.113
Because that's
Franklin Saint's auntie.

06:58.156 --> 07:01.595
The kid who beat the murder rapa couple months ago?

07:01.638 --> 07:04.119
Look, we got her
24 hours, right?

07:04.162 --> 07:06.513
Let me go in there and sweat
her, shake out some evidence,

07:06.556 --> 07:08.340
see if I can get something
to leverage her with.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.517
We do have to go to court today.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.258
All right, Sergeant.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.826
Go in it.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.089
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.091
-Hey.
-They counter?

07:20.135 --> 07:23.921
Came back with no contingencies,and 50,000 above asking.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.706
50? You serious?

07:25.749 --> 07:28.360
Yeah. They claim
to have another offer.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.623
I'll need
to move additional funds over

07:29.666 --> 07:31.363
if we're gonna counter.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.887
I can pull what we need
from the accounts in Jersey.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.671
Uh, if we decide
to up our offer,

07:34.715 --> 07:37.282
I'll just move cash
to the escrow account.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.719
Why? What's wrong
with our offshore accounts

07:38.762 --> 07:41.548
-all of a sudden?
-You know, right now,

07:41.591 --> 07:43.637
I want to keep all
our real estate holdings clear

07:43.680 --> 07:45.508
-of any money Reed Thompson
knows about.
-[pager beeping]

07:45.552 --> 07:47.031
Just to be safe.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.643
Uh...

07:49.686 --> 07:51.906
Uh, give me a minute, okay?

08:05.354 --> 08:08.792
[line ringing]

08:08.836 --> 08:10.925
[over phone]:
Hey, it's Yuda. Avi's here.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.622
You can come up to the house.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.669
FRANKLIN:Good. All right. I'm on my way.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
I got to run.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.679
-Franklin...
-Tell me something,

08:25.722 --> 08:28.377
you think they really got
another offer?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.771
Uh, I have no idea.
It's possible.

08:30.814 --> 08:34.818
Hmm. All right,
let me think on it.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.081
I love you.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.651
[door closes]

08:43.740 --> 08:45.699
ANDRE:
Listen to me, Louie.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.136
We got a witness put you
at the scene.

08:48.179 --> 08:51.661
And I also know you and Claudiahad a fight a while back,

08:51.705 --> 08:52.662
put her in the hospital.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.448
That's motive.

08:58.842 --> 09:02.585
Tell me what happened now,
and maybe I can help you.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.848
[Louie laughs]

09:04.892 --> 09:06.589
You full of shit.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.159
The window in the bathroom
didn't have the shades down.

09:11.202 --> 09:14.597
It faces the building
in the back.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.904
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

09:18.427 --> 09:22.562
Cooperation at this stage
means a lot.

09:24.694 --> 09:29.003
But once I file witnesses,
hard evidence?

09:31.309 --> 09:33.442
Ain't a damn thing I can do.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.020
AVI:
Franklin!

09:48.326 --> 09:49.806
To what do I owe the pleasure?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.678
[chuckles softly]
Avi.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.768
[sighs]

09:54.811 --> 09:56.900
Everything okay?

09:56.944 --> 10:00.121
Everything's peachy.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.298
Just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.647
So what's up?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.997
I need your advice on something.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.696
Having some issues
on my cash flow.

10:09.739 --> 10:13.264
AVI:
What, those rocks of yours
not selling?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.919
FRANKLIN:
Actually, they moving
better than ever.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.660
Problem is...

10:17.704 --> 10:19.140
I don't know what to do
with my money.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.359
The best kind of problems.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.927
[chuckles] Yeah.

10:23.971 --> 10:27.061
-But problems just the same.
-Hmm.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.671
A while back, you was telling me

10:28.715 --> 10:31.500
-about offshore banking.
-AVI: Hmm.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.893
That something you could
still help me with?

10:32.936 --> 10:35.678
Ah, well. That depends.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.854
How much money we talking about?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.726
YUDA:
Six inch open-bolt

10:39.769 --> 10:41.902
-submachine gun.
-How many rounds per minute?

10:41.945 --> 10:44.731
-950.
-[exhales sharply]

10:44.774 --> 10:47.037
Why don't you... let me

10:47.081 --> 10:48.517
talk to some of my contacts?

10:48.560 --> 10:51.259
See what I can do.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.695
-You like?
-[scoffs]

10:52.739 --> 10:54.915
Hell, no.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.960
You was gonna shoot me
with that, first time we met.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.701
Ah, I was never gonna shoot you.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.094
-[laughs]
-I was testing you.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.965
[both chuckle]

11:02.009 --> 11:04.925
There's a big difference.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.362
[Avi sniffs]

11:08.885 --> 11:10.670
Sure you're okay, Avi?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.545
The longer you live,

11:16.588 --> 11:18.765
the more mistakes you make.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.898
And eventually,
if you're not careful...

11:22.943 --> 11:24.858
...they catch up with you.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.120
What mistakes?

11:26.163 --> 11:27.948
[chuckles]

11:27.991 --> 11:29.514
No matter.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.734
[Avi sniffles] Never get

11:31.778 --> 11:33.605
too greedy, Franklin.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.608
The minute you do that...

11:36.652 --> 11:38.872
they found your weakness.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.048
You lost your advantage.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.356
Yuda, show our, uh,
young friends out.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.967

What the fuck
are you doing here?

32:05.662 --> 32:07.577
You're a hard man
to get ahold of.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.406
[exhales]

32:10.450 --> 32:13.757
-The recent airdrops...
-TEDDY: Have been disrupted.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.238
-I know.
-Not just diverted or delayed,

32:16.282 --> 32:17.979
but shot down.
Weapons taken and used

32:18.023 --> 32:20.199
against the Contras.

32:22.244 --> 32:25.247
Have you even read
the latest dispatches?

32:25.291 --> 32:28.033
[exhales] This week...
uh, hasn't been...

32:28.076 --> 32:30.035
great.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.385
Had to take Matt home, so...

32:36.041 --> 32:37.651
The Sandinistas
have found a way

32:37.694 --> 32:39.348
to track our movements
out of Honduras.

32:39.392 --> 32:42.221
We need to find another way.

32:42.264 --> 32:43.787
Okay.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.050
I'll figure it out.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.269
I already did
a little looking into it.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.706
The problem...
is the entry point.

32:49.750 --> 32:53.362
So we move it south:Costa Rica. A private airstrip.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.234
You'll be able to make
your flight paths

32:55.277 --> 32:57.497
more unpredictable
and use ground transports.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.151
And the Costa Rican government?

32:59.194 --> 33:00.717
Can't know anything
about it, of course.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.502
But we may have
some support there.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.199
From who?

33:06.201 --> 33:08.029
A former operative
in the Talamanca region.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.162
A smuggler.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.077
He has an airstrip, but...

33:12.120 --> 33:15.080
it's a matter of establishing
contact and he's a bit...

33:15.123 --> 33:17.038
off the grid.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.216
Okay.

33:21.260 --> 33:24.915
You got, uh, the details for me?

33:27.353 --> 33:28.528
For us.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.141
I'm here to help... quietly.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.404
I'm to brief you with the option

33:35.448 --> 33:37.667
of coordinating and aiding.

33:40.975 --> 33:43.064
Y-You're gonna stay here
and help me?

33:43.108 --> 33:45.066
[laughs]

33:45.110 --> 33:47.112
When you came to me in D.C.,
sent me to Havemeyer,

33:47.155 --> 33:49.201
you put me
in the middle of this.

33:49.244 --> 33:52.639
Oh...

33:52.682 --> 33:54.336
yeah, so I guess...

33:54.380 --> 33:57.078
that means that you're reportingback to them.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.341
You threatened
to make noise, Teddy.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.387
What did you think
was gonna happen?

34:03.563 --> 34:06.218
-[exhales]
-Operational reports
out of Nicaragua

34:06.261 --> 34:08.133
are fine;
I do not want them knowing

34:08.176 --> 34:10.352
-the identities of any
of my assets here.
-Of course.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.441
I won't jeopardize your people.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.661
And...

34:14.704 --> 34:17.664
I mean, you're okay?

34:17.707 --> 34:19.666
-Doing this with me?
-You read about

34:19.709 --> 34:22.234
the American journalist killed
in the La Penca bombing?

34:22.277 --> 34:25.933
The Sandinistas are getting
the upper hand, Teddy.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.287
This isn't about us.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.120
Show me the, um...

34:39.164 --> 34:41.253
-show me the airstrip.
-Okay, mm-hmm.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.732
So he's in the mountainous
region here.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.169
Yeah.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.736
Which gives us these options.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.391
The cove in here...

34:49.435 --> 34:51.611
Yeah, I know.
Stern and Aviles briefed me.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.308
You gave it a shot.

34:53.352 --> 34:55.310
I appreciate
the initiative, Wright.

34:55.354 --> 34:58.226
You'll make Sergeant II in no
time. Thanks for stopping by.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.793
Thank you, sir.

34:59.836 --> 35:02.491
But... something's happening
in my neighborhood.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.363
There's more money
on the streets,

35:04.406 --> 35:07.409
more shootings, new drugs.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.846
Something's changing
in a big way.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.414
You run it up the chain?
Lieutenant Todd?

35:12.458 --> 35:14.242
Oh, yes, sir.
But the Lieutenant

35:14.286 --> 35:17.550
isn't that, um...
interested.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.336
Well... it's admirable
to live and work

35:21.380 --> 35:23.382
in the community.
Good on you, Wright.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.433
Captain.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.435
This is something new.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.308
Okay? It-it's,
it's called "rock."

35:36.351 --> 35:38.179
And it's expanding beyond
my neighborhood

35:38.223 --> 35:40.529
and moving up
towards the Coliseum.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.402
Chief Gates got that area
locked down.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.534
Oh, of course he does, but...
with the opening ceremonies

35:45.578 --> 35:47.362
around the corner, I figured...

35:47.406 --> 35:49.147
it should be brought
to your attention.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.239
What are you suggesting?

35:59.331 --> 36:01.768
FRANKLIN:
Here he come.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.987
I hate this nigga, man.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.772
[chuckles]

36:05.815 --> 36:07.208
Ease up.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.914
Good to see you boys
enjoying this nice summer day.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.307
Should be nice
if you got the cash.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.656
'Course I do, Lil' Lee.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.444
I trust the count's right.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.488
Think I'm gonna fuck around
with y'all

36:26.532 --> 36:29.839
the way that pure rock movin'?

36:31.754 --> 36:34.757
So, you got my re-up or what?

36:38.065 --> 36:39.545
Come on.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.506
All right,
so, we gonna do things

36:44.550 --> 36:46.856
just a little different, Drew.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.512
I'm gonna give you two birds,
untouched.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.819
You're gonna cook it yourself,
rock it yourself,

36:52.862 --> 36:54.386
cut it yourself.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.302
Little more sweat
for a lot more cash.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.522
You feel me?

37:00.566 --> 37:02.176
-That a problem, little man?
-Just wondering why

37:02.220 --> 37:03.308
y'all switching shit up already.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.135
'Cause you can handle it.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.311
That's why.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.272
I mean, what, you got...

37:11.316 --> 37:13.970
cornerboys, cookers.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.930
No need for us to do the workyou can do for yourself, right?

37:20.107 --> 37:22.849
You wanted trust?

37:22.892 --> 37:24.894
Here it is.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.073
All right, Saint.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.858
See you soon.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.425
Mm-hmm.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.520
See y'all, boys.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.435
[car door opens, closes]

37:43.478 --> 37:44.697
[engine starts]

37:51.573 --> 37:53.662
I still think trusting
that motherfucker

37:53.706 --> 37:56.230
don't make no sense.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.408
It makes perfect sense.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.020
We getting hit, Lee.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.458
Cops is on us.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.374
Cornerboys getting sloppy.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.463
More street business
means more problems.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.465
Problems we don't need.

38:13.508 --> 38:17.469
Nickel-and-diming rockseventually gonna get you busted.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.559
Our advantage is pure product

38:20.602 --> 38:22.212
at basement prices,

38:22.256 --> 38:24.911
and that's where
we gonna focus on.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.913
From here on out,

38:26.956 --> 38:30.220
we only want dealers
who can buy kilos.

38:30.264 --> 38:34.355
Identify 'em, send them to Leonand Peaches to check out,

38:34.399 --> 38:36.618
and Louie'll make
the final decision.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.447
But we're
still moving rock, right?

38:39.491 --> 38:40.492
For now...

38:40.535 --> 38:42.581
we need the cash flow.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.627
But eventually,
the goal is to only deal

38:45.671 --> 38:49.501
with a few high-level
customers...

38:49.544 --> 38:52.286
and serious fuckin' weight, huh?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.593
-[laughter]
-Start thinking about who

38:54.636 --> 38:55.594
you want to bring in,
all right?

38:55.637 --> 38:58.031
-Cool.
-All right, y'all.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.250
All right, now. What's up, boy?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.732
-See you, boy.
-A'ight, Unc.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.300
-We're gonna get there.
-Thank you, man.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.736
You feeling better?

39:07.780 --> 39:09.129
