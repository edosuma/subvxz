WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:04.672
I gotta say,
this is pretty nice.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.207
It really is,
you know?

00:08.076 --> 00:09.143
And you know
what we should next Saturday

00:09.177 --> 00:10.010
is batting cages.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.380
Oh, I like that.
I don't play baseball.

00:12.413 --> 00:16.117
You don't have to.
They got mini golf.
They got go-karts.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
You're gonna --
You're gonna find something.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.420
I promise.
All right. Here we go.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.355
We got "Danger Mountain Two"
on Netflix.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.556
Let's make it happen,
all right?

00:22.590 --> 00:23.724
We never saw part one.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.293
Oh, no problem.
I'll fill ya in.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.561
Oh!
He is so good at this.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.197
Here it goes. Ready?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.599
A guy comes into town
looking for a girl.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.834
Another guy says,
"You talking about Mojita?"

00:33.867 --> 00:34.635
He's like, "I am."

00:34.668 --> 00:36.204
He's like,
"You'll never find her."

00:36.237 --> 00:37.438
He finds her. Right?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.439
He goes out there.
He's like, "I love you,

00:38.472 --> 00:40.308
but I can't take this,"
and she's like, "What?"

00:40.341 --> 00:41.542
She takes out a gun.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.843
He's like "No!"
She's like, "Yes!"

00:42.876 --> 00:44.145
He's like "No!"
She's like, "Yes!"

00:44.178 --> 00:45.279
Boom!
She shoots him.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.414
Oh!
Right there -- bang!

00:46.447 --> 00:49.450
He goes down like a --
like that, right?

00:49.483 --> 00:51.185
But he doesn't die.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.821
And here's the twist --
he's her brother.

00:53.854 --> 00:57.425
But that's not the big twist!
They're both clones!

00:57.458 --> 00:59.827
Then they go on
a journey of revenge.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.130
Everybody dies.
The end.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.764
-Here we go.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.533
Wow!

01:05.566 --> 01:06.800
I feel like I just saw
that movie.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.202
Yeah, it's good.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.303
Why do they call it
"Danger Mountain"?

01:09.337 --> 01:12.606
I'm not sure. I feel asleep
during the mountain part.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.308
You know what? I'll get us
some drinks for this one.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.444
What do you want?
Anything flammable.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.114
This is the third Saturday
in a row

01:20.148 --> 01:21.815
that we've been out
with him.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.117
When are you gonna tell him
it's weird?

01:23.151 --> 01:25.153
I can't.
Do you see how happy he is?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.554
Oh, he's not the one
who's happy.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.122
You are.
Yeah, I know,

01:28.156 --> 01:30.224
and it's killing you,
isn't it?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.825
Fine.
Hey, Kev.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.127
Kevin: Yeah?

01:33.161 --> 01:34.562
We might pass
on the movie.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.464
I know what you mean.
Look what I got in the mail.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.267
"Motocross Mamba:
Dirt Bikes and Desert Snakes."

01:39.300 --> 01:40.301
Oh,
I heard that's great!

01:40.334 --> 01:42.336
It's unbelievable!

01:42.370 --> 01:47.175
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:48.542 --> 01:50.178
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:50.211 --> 01:50.978
I have
a 1:00 appointment.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.813
Yes, hello.
You must be Rebecca.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.782
I am.
I'm Vanessa Cellucci.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.284
Have a seat.
Thank you.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.586
Oh, crap on a cracker.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.189
Is that a Marchetti?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.456
Yeah, actually it is.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.293
Oh, my God.
I love them.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.628
Like, love them more
than I would love a child.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.198
Pr-- I mean, prob--
I'm just guessing.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.366
Actually, I'm not guessing.
I would lo-- I would!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.335
Well, I work for the company.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.304
I handle
their East Coast sales, so...

02:16.337 --> 02:18.239
So you get, like,
a crazy discount, right?

02:18.272 --> 02:19.473
Yeah, well, they actually
just kind of gave me one.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.608
They gave you that one?
Yeah. Yeah.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.742
Okay.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.676
So, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.877
Uh, you mentioned something
on the phone

02:23.911 --> 02:25.479
about an ex

02:25.513 --> 02:27.881
Yeah.
Uh, it was a bad break up.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.350
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, restraining order.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.252
Yeah.
Anyway, I need someone

02:31.285 --> 02:33.221
to serve him
these legal documents

02:33.254 --> 02:34.588
as soon as possible.
Okay.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.889
And obviously,
I can't do it myself

02:35.923 --> 02:37.725
because I've got this --
Hi. How you doing?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.793
Uh, listen do we have
one of those Tide pen things?

02:39.827 --> 02:43.231
Me and Rootger
went to Arby's and...

02:43.264 --> 02:44.798
Look, you know the rest,
so just...

02:44.832 --> 02:47.501
Okay. Uh, Kevin,
this is Rebecca Romero.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.969
-Nice to see you.
-Rebecca, this is Kevin Gable,

02:49.002 --> 02:52.306
my partner, and he was
just about to apologize

02:52.340 --> 02:53.207
for interrupting.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.576
Actually,
you should try seltzer water.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.311
Really?
Does it work on barbecue sauce?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.979
Yeah. Probably, yeah.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.749
That's great 'cause I
got a separate pants
situation at home.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.319
Last week, I almost lost
a plate of ribs,

03:05.353 --> 03:07.321
but I saved them
with my thighs!

03:08.989 --> 03:10.224
All right,
I'll try the seltzer.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.360
Thanks for the tip.
Okay.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.528
How do you not crack up
working with him all day?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.264
Oh, I find a way.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.599
Wow!

03:18.632 --> 03:19.567
Yep! I know.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.536
He's a lot coming at you
all at once, right?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.771
I like it.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.273
Oh. Okay.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.642
Yeah. Yeah, he's --
he's funny, confident.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.279
I-I hope I'm not out of line
for asking,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.381
but -- but wh-what's
his situation?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.349
Wait. Are you --
Are you guys to--

03:35.383 --> 03:37.318
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.852
Oh, no, no. No.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.855
So, what -- what --
what's

03:41.889 --> 03:43.757
Do you think
he'd be interested?

03:43.791 --> 03:46.427
Okay, w-we're -- we are talking
about the same guy, right?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.028
The one that was just in here
with the stains

03:48.061 --> 03:49.663
and the whole thing?
Yeah!

03:49.697 --> 03:51.832
Yeah, I just -- I feel like
he has this warmth to him

03:51.865 --> 03:54.868
like a big blanket
that makes you feel safe,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.370
you know?

03:56.404 --> 03:59.973
You see, I get more
of a beanbag chair on wheels.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.310
You know what I mean?

04:02.343 --> 04:03.711
How it moves around a lot.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.313
You what I mean?
No?

04:05.346 --> 04:07.581
Listen, if you like him,
why don't you go talk to him?

04:07.615 --> 04:09.016
Maybe you could --
you could, you know,

04:09.049 --> 04:10.618
put in
a good word for me?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.486
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just --

04:12.520 --> 04:13.687
I was just looking
at the bag.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.356
Mm-hmm.
I just...

04:15.389 --> 04:18.659
Do you know if it comes
with the matching makeup case?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.361
It does.
It does.
It does.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.929
And you got that one
for free?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.464
I did.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.300
And I might just have
an extra one in my car.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.369
Then, yes,
I can talk to him.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.870
I can talk to him.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.405
You're supposed to blot.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.806
I am blotting.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.908
Thank you.
Yes, thank you so much
for coming in.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.076
It was so good
to meet you.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.845
-You too.
-All right. Bye, Kevin.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.046
Be good.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.917
Okay.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.386
Do you even know
what "blotting" means?

04:45.419 --> 04:46.454
Do you know what it means?
Honestly.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.388
Well, yes,
I do know what it means.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.656
Do they have blotting
where you're from?

04:48.689 --> 04:49.890
Okay.
All right.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.925
Hate to break up
the Mensa meeting,

04:51.959 --> 04:53.661
but can I -- can I, uh,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.095
can I talk to you
for a second?
What's up?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.466
Well, just wanted
to get your thoughts on Rebecca.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.534
My thoughts?
She's a client.
Yeah.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.736
If the check clears, I'm happy.
Those are my thoughts.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.938
Well, the thing is,
is that we were talking,

05:04.972 --> 05:06.507
and she thinks
you're cute.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.975
Rootger: What?!

05:08.008 --> 05:08.909
Well, I'm baffled!

05:08.942 --> 05:11.379
Think about it --
your level is right here.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.880
If you look at her --
boom!

05:12.913 --> 05:15.115
Right there,
maybe even there.
Okay, I get it. I got it.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.117
Big space.
I get where you're going.
Thank you. Thank you.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.586
I understand.
I will handle --
I will handle this!

05:18.619 --> 05:19.720
Thank you!
You don't have
to handle anything.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.654
Thank you, okay?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.357
Look, I'm -- I'm not ready
to do this yet.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.425
I'm not -- I don't want to go
out with her.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.427
Why?
You got to get out there.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.496
What are you talking --
Why not just
jump in there,

05:28.529 --> 05:29.296
go on a date with her?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.031
She's beautiful,
and, by the way,

05:31.064 --> 05:32.466
such a sweet girl.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.467
I'll tell you
why I can't --

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
'cause I would need
six months

05:35.035 --> 05:37.438
to get back
into dating shape, minimum.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.440
And that's every day
on my Ab Blaster.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.708
Every day!

05:40.741 --> 05:43.043
She likes you
just the way you are.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.145
Don't be selfish.
We need this.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.947
"We"?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.916
I mean you.
You need it.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.518
You got to start dating!

05:50.551 --> 05:51.785
Just the other night,
he had a double date

05:51.819 --> 05:53.020
with Mott and his wife.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.389
By himself?

05:55.423 --> 05:57.858
That's not a double date.
That's a third wheel!

05:57.891 --> 05:59.760
Oh, hey, they penciled me in
for a re-date,

05:59.793 --> 06:02.463
so somebody's doing
something right, okay?

06:02.496 --> 06:05.466
Look, even if I were to go out
with her and say I wanted to,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.701
I'd have to -- I'd have
to run it by the kids,

06:07.735 --> 06:08.902
and I'm gonna tell you
right now,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.070
they would not be okay
with it.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.839
Totally okay with it!
Yeah.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.875
Yeah, it'd be weird
if you didn't go.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.410
You see?
They want you to go.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.078
They're just putting on
a brave face.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.447
No,
these are our faces.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.451
Look, we've been telling you
you should go.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.885
I understand that,
but I-I --

06:24.918 --> 06:26.153
Tonight, it just doesn't feel
like the right time.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.455
Okay.
Maybe we'll do it
another night.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
No, no.
Kevin, you're getting nervous!

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
Now, it's the first time
that you're --

06:31.859 --> 06:33.994
you're dipping your toe
in the dating pool.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.029
It's gonna be fine.
I promise you, okay?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.565
Just no cellphones
'cause that's rude.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.632
Oh, and make sure
to make eye contact.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.734
Uh-huh.
And compliment her shoes.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.135
Tip 20%.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.838
Let 'em know you're a player,
player.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.206
You know what? Now you're making
too big a deal of this.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.775
It's okay.
All right.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.911
-Hey!
-Oh-ho-ho!

06:50.944 --> 06:52.145
You got to be
kidding me!

06:52.179 --> 06:54.181
So, what are you wearing?
Give us a spin!

06:54.214 --> 06:57.685
Sorry, guy. I didn't want
to come. She made me.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.453
You look great, Dad.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.555
Thanks,
but why is everybody here?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.657
It's your first date
in 25 years.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.858
I mean, that's exciting.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.595
Yes, I harken back
to when Kendra and I

07:07.628 --> 07:09.763
first went out, uh,
and I will never forget

07:09.797 --> 07:11.632
you leaned across the table
and said to me --

07:11.665 --> 07:13.501
Holy crap.
Is that a Marchetti?

07:14.602 --> 07:18.105
Uh, no, she complimented me
on my bolo tie

07:18.138 --> 07:20.741
and said that I looked like
I could be in Rascal Flatts.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.912
So, did you, uh, do
the cologne sandwich?

07:24.945 --> 07:25.913
What?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.515
My move, you know?

07:27.548 --> 07:28.448
Put some cologne on,

07:28.482 --> 07:30.484
you hop on the elliptical
for 20 minutes,

07:30.518 --> 07:31.919
slap
some more cologne on.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.220
Works every time.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.988
Then why are you here alone
on a Saturday night?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.024
Because my elliptical
is broken.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.527
Take me aside next time,
guy.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.562
So, where are you guys
going?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.630
Just a restaurant.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.532
Gonna take her for dinner
and then I'm coming home.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.232
That's it.
-Wait. No!

07:45.265 --> 07:46.634
You gotta go out after.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.101
You have to make a night
out of it.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.537
Hey!
You should take her

07:49.570 --> 07:52.573
to an escape room!
A what?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.274
It is a thrilling,
high-intensity challenge

07:54.307 --> 07:55.676
where you're locked
inside a room,

07:55.709 --> 07:56.844
and you have
to solve a-a series

07:56.877 --> 07:59.212
of intricate puzzles
just to escape!

08:00.614 --> 08:02.215
Wish me luck, everybody!

08:02.249 --> 08:03.951
Bye!
Good luck.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.520
**

08:07.555 --> 08:08.255
You look nice.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.957
I, uh -- I like your hair.
Oh.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.593
It's got, uh...
good sheen.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.094
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.095
I'm not really sure
what that means.

08:15.128 --> 08:15.996
I saw it in a commercial once,
but it's good.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.065
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.967
Uh, you --
you look really nice, too.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.769
Thank you.
I just, uh --

08:21.802 --> 08:23.971
just threw it on last minute,
you know?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.974
I, uh -- I'm lying.
I am lying.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.276
I w-- I went through
like five changes.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.044
It was weird.
Huh. Only five?

08:31.078 --> 08:34.081
Yeah.
Oh, well, if we're
being completely honest,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.216
I think I tried on everything
in my closet.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.651
Okay, well,
if I'm being honest,

08:37.685 --> 08:38.986
I-I sat down
really slowly tonight

08:39.019 --> 08:40.287
because
I was super nervous,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.122
and I put on a bunch
of baby powder --

08:42.155 --> 08:43.123
'cause I sweat a lot --
Oh.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.159
and -- and I was worried
if I sat down too quick,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.995
it might look like
Mount St. Helens.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.329
Oh!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.264
Well, honestly,
I did see a little poof,

08:51.298 --> 08:52.766
but I just thought
your chair was dusty,

08:52.800 --> 08:53.567
so don't worry about it.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.669
No. That was all me.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.970
But I'm dry as an infant.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.005
All right,
let's get some calamari.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.039
What do you say?
Okay, yeah.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.775
**

09:01.809 --> 09:02.776
Hey.
Hey.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.044
Is Jim here?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.113
Yeah, he's in your office,
but, uh, I'm confused.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.848
Why are we working
at night?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.851
We had to lure
Rebecca's ex-boyfriend here

09:10.884 --> 09:12.252
so we can serve him
the papers.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.286
It's a sting.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.188
Okay, but, uh,
he says he's here

09:15.222 --> 09:17.658
to pick up concert tickets
he won on the radio.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.227
That's the sting.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.831
Okay.
It's a cop trick.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.098
You know, you tell someone
they won something,

09:25.132 --> 09:25.966
they show up to collect,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.835
and that's when you put
the hook in.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.006
Sorry.
Am I in the right place?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.908
I was supposed to be picking up
Brooks & Dunn tickets.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.644
Oh.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.211
I'm so sorry, Jim.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.647
The concert's
been cancelled,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.149
but you did win these --

09:42.182 --> 09:45.218
some legal papers
from Rebecca Romero.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.187
Rebecca?
Yeah.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.122
Okay.
She's not here, is she?

09:49.156 --> 09:50.123
Why? I'm sorry.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.058
Are you scared
of violating

09:51.091 --> 09:52.259
your restraining order?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.227
No, I have a restraining order
against her.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.229
Okay, like you expect us
to believe that.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.330
We weren't born tomorrow,
my friend.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.232
Okay.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.668
Here.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.002
See for yourself.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.105
Oh. Okay.
This looks kind of legit.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.142
Does she even work for
the Marchetti handbag company?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.311
No, but she has been arrested
for stealing them.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.647
I have the receipt
for this.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.151
I'm telling you --
she is psychotic.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.821
Once she latches on,
she doesn't let go.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.222
Four out of her
last five exes

10:22.255 --> 10:23.991
have restraining orders
against her.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.192
What happened
to the fifth?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.660
"Fell off
a cruise ship."

10:28.195 --> 10:30.197
We probably could've used
this info a few hours ago.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.706
Hey, I-I think your phone's
buzzing again.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.008
Oh.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.210
It's Vanessa.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.878
It's like the fifth time
she's called.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.213
Oh, well,
maybe you should just get it.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.316
Nah. No, she said I
should be a gentleman
and not be on my phone.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.852
She's right.
She's probably just testing me.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.421
Well, guess what -- Mm!
Just passed.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.258
Hey, can I be honest
with you?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.327
Yeah, that --
that's our thing.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.896
This place is a little too fancy
for me.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.398
I'm kind of a simple girl.
Me too!

11:05.432 --> 11:08.869
I mean, not the "girl" part,
but, yeah, I'm simple as well.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.270
It's like -- like --
I don't like --

11:10.303 --> 11:11.338
It's too much going on
in here.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.907
The flowers, the -- the
double

11:13.941 --> 11:15.976
W-Whatever you were gonna put
in this, just put it in this.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.911
Get rid of it.

11:17.945 --> 11:18.946
Do you want
to get out of here?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.481
H-H-Have you ever been
to, uh, All American Burger?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.582
No, but I'm listening.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.752
Okay. First of all,
they have the greatest burgers,

11:24.785 --> 11:27.087
but they also have fried shrimp,
which is odd, but it works.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.889
I'm telling you!
Let's do it!

11:28.922 --> 11:31.424
Let's do it.
Okay.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.161
"Mom, I think I found
my soul mate."

11:34.194 --> 11:35.262
That's funny.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.964
Yeah.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.398
And send.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.170
Okay, now, the waiter said
they just left,

11:43.203 --> 11:46.273
but he overheard them talking
about going to a burger place.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.108
That could be
anywhere on the island.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.110
No, he's with a girl,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.079
so he's gonna try
to show off.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.114
All American Burger.
All American Burger.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.315
Got it.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.117
I can't believe this.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.151
Wow!

11:58.185 --> 11:59.486
You called it.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.754
Mm.
This is pretty incredible.

12:00.788 --> 12:01.822
Yep.
You know what it is?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.524
It's -- It's the meat-to-bun
ratio. It's on point.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.827
And the fact that they don't
use lettuce and tomato,

12:06.860 --> 12:09.296
it's a celebration
of what isn't.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.530
Wow!
Mm-hmm.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
You've really thought
about this.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.300
Yeah.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.802
That's what
I love about you.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.203
You know what it is?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.872
Most people just --
they just eat their food,

12:18.906 --> 12:21.274
you know, but I like to -- to
know how things work, you know?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.376
Mm.
That's why if you have
some time one day,

12:23.410 --> 12:24.978
I'd love to tell you about
why Taco Bell's

12:25.012 --> 12:28.348
Cheesy Gordita Crunch
is the perfect food.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.117
Awesome! We can grab a bunch
for the ride

12:30.150 --> 12:31.551
when we head upstate
for Thanksgiving.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.153
Mm-hmm.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.788
What's that now?

12:34.822 --> 12:37.925
Thanksgiving.
It's huge in my family.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.895
Yeah, it's...huge in a --
in a lot -- lot of families.

12:41.929 --> 12:45.999
Um...y-you think we're kind of
getting ahead of ourselves

12:46.033 --> 12:46.766
on this one?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.568
If this is gonna work,
you know,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.971
we -- we need
to plan things.

12:51.004 --> 12:51.872
And -- And I know.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.473
it's just that, um...

12:53.506 --> 12:56.576
it's like, uh, 10 months away
still, so...

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
Yeah! Planning!

12:58.411 --> 13:00.547
And this year,
my brother gets out of jail,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.916
so it's gonna be
a big one.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.187
I can't belive this.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.990
Kevin's on his first date
in 25 years,

13:10.023 --> 13:11.224
and the girl's a nut job!

13:11.258 --> 13:12.392
This is all my fault.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.829
Oh, come on now.
It's not your fault.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.598
Although you did push him
quite a bit.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.101
By the way, would you mind
picking up the pace, Grandma?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.435
Hey, I'm not gonna get
pulled over.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.971
I don't even have
a license.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.940
**

13:26.974 --> 13:29.342
Mm!
Man, I'm full.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.050
Tired.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.919
Should probably get going,
huh?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.888
Oh.
Get you home.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.622
I ruined the night,
didn't I?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.924
I was too pushy.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.258
I-I do that
all the time.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.593
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.594
Not at all.
Not at all.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.029
I finally meet
a great guy,

13:49.062 --> 13:50.197
and then --
and then I ruin it.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.065
Trust me, I'm --
I'm not that great.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.200
Can I be honest?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.903
I am not well liked
in my community.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.939
I'm not, and I know we joked
about the baby powder before,

13:58.972 --> 14:01.909
but truth is,
I do need it.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.243
It's a medical condition.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.477
They don't even know
what's going on down there.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.981
You're so sweet and honest.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.050
Can -- Can we just
start fresh

14:10.083 --> 14:12.352
and -- and -- and have fun
for the rest of the night?

14:12.385 --> 14:15.122
I really can be fun.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.191
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.660
Um, you know,
my son-in-law,

14:20.693 --> 14:21.995
he -- he --
he brought up

14:22.029 --> 14:23.931
about going to, like,
an escape room.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.232
I don't know if you've ever gone
to one of those --

14:25.265 --> 14:26.566
Oh, that's -- that's one
of those things

14:26.599 --> 14:28.101
where they lock you up
in a room,

14:28.135 --> 14:29.937
and you have to solve
all these puzzles to get out?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.104
Yeah. I mean,
we could do that

14:31.138 --> 14:32.139
or then we can go to, like,
batting cages.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.974
You want to go
to batting cages?
No, no, no.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.642
No, let's -- let's go
to the one

14:35.675 --> 14:37.610
where you get locked
in the room.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.512
Sure.
Let's do it.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.114
**

14:41.148 --> 14:44.051
Okay, so they went
to All American Burger and left.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.186
Now we just have to figure out
where they're going.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.521
I'm afraid it's too late.
What?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.257
I have a sixth sense
about these things.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.558
Kevin is dead.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.264
What?
He's not dead.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.565
He is.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.268
A-A-A strange chill
came over my body.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.536
That's 'cause you're drinking
a milkshake.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.172
Oh.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.174
Yeah, that's probably it.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.242
**

15:09.276 --> 15:10.143
And the clues
to the puzzle

15:10.177 --> 15:11.678
will give you the key
to open the door.

15:11.711 --> 15:15.048
The fastest escape from
this room has been 52 minutes,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.684
and the longest,
5 hours and 34 minutes.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.452
Would you like to come up
with a safe word

15:19.486 --> 15:21.221
in the event
that you're too scared?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.626
Been on the police force
for 20 years.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.095
I think I'll be okay.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.629
Ooh, plastic axe!

15:29.662 --> 15:32.199
Ooh, that's real,
actually.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.700
Okay.
Have fun.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.541
Vanessa.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.176
Okay,
what is so important?

15:43.210 --> 15:46.246
Listen to me,
do not interrupt.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.349
I want you to listen to
everything that I am saying.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.950
Are you with Rebecca?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.089
Are you with Rebecca?!

15:56.123 --> 15:58.725
You said don't interrupt.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.493
Where are you?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.729
I g--
I'm in a dungeon.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.565
Um, okay.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.000
Well, get out.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.768
Rebecca is crazy.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.437
Yeah, believe me.
I'm starting to realize that.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.639
No, no, no.
Like, really insane.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.409
Every ex-boyfriend has
a restraining order against her.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.112
Get out now!

16:21.748 --> 16:23.750
Yeah,
that's gonna be a problem.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.191
That is sealed shut.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.692
All right,
you know what?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.761
I think we should, uh, probably
come up with a safe word.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.629
I-I like "anaconda."
Let's do that.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.331
You know what? We're gonna --
We're gonna change.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.100
We're gonna go
with a safe word.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.801
We're gonna go
with "anaconda."

16:41.834 --> 16:44.471
By the way
anaconda!

16:46.506 --> 16:48.608
So...I'm crazy, huh?

16:48.641 --> 16:51.311
What's that now?
Yeah.
I overheard your conversation.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.380
Vanessa thinks I'm insane
and that you should
get away from me?

16:53.413 --> 16:54.781
No, no. First of all,
she meant "insane"

16:54.814 --> 16:56.383
like a good --
like, "She's insane!

16:56.416 --> 16:57.684
What? She's insane!"

16:57.717 --> 16:59.252
She was complimenting you,
all right?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.620
I really think we should focus
on getting out of here.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.655
That's what we should do.
Oh, there -- there's a key.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.257
I think
we're great together!

17:04.291 --> 17:06.359
I don't understand
why you'd want to leave me!

17:06.393 --> 17:08.495
I don't want to leave you.
I'm trying to leave the room.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.197
That's the idea
of an escape room is to --

17:10.230 --> 17:11.664
to leave the room,
you know?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.401
Look, that key
must mean something.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.835
And there's a pegboard.
You just go up the pegboard.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.869
I'll go up --
boom, boom, boom, boom --

17:16.903 --> 17:18.438
grab the key, and we'll get
out of here, okay?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.372
Let's do this.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.308
Wow. It's just like
one thing goes wrong,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.343
and you just want
to give up.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.595
I think
that's just a decoy.

17:44.464 --> 17:45.532
I'm not stupid.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.300
You don't like me,
and it's obvious.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.801
I didn't say
I didn't like you.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.770
Really?
You like me?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.439
Absolutely, I --
Hey, buddy!

17:52.472 --> 17:54.207
How about a hint on how
to get out of here?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.842
Josh:
No clues for the first hour.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.745
Of course there's not.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.247
You know what?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.482
Chale mentioned something
about an escape room.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.484
I'm gonna see if there's any
in the area.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.485
Okay.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.187
There's two.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.223
One in, uh, Massapequa,

18:10.257 --> 18:14.127
and a discount one
in Lindenhurst.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.562
Lindenhurst.
Lindenhurst.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.331
I'm just clinging to any hope
he's still alive.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.766
What are you
talking about?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.334
He's alive!
I just talked to him!

18:21.368 --> 18:23.270
You just --
You were in the ca--

18:23.303 --> 18:24.637
You hear-- Okay.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
Oh, come on.

18:28.341 --> 18:32.379
All I did was invite you
to my family's for Thanksgiving.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.713
Out of the kindness
of my heart.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.248
And I thought that was --
that was super sweet.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.849
I'm very happy your brother's
getting parole, too.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.718
I'm very big
on second chances.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.787
Oh!
You think this is funny?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.455
You think I'm crazy?
Well, I'm gonna show you crazy.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.923
Why don't you Google me?
Google me right now!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.658
Where's your phone?
Google me! Yeah.
I-I-I don't --

18:45.692 --> 18:47.260
I don't need to Google you.
I'll take your word for it.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.362
Okay, Josh, are you getting
any of this

18:49.396 --> 18:51.331
Yeah,
and if you are listening,

18:51.364 --> 18:52.098
you would know
that he's the one

18:52.131 --> 18:53.900
that's emotionally
unavailable --

18:53.933 --> 18:56.703
Aah!

18:56.736 --> 18:57.770
Oh, thank God.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.272
Hey, not so scary now,
are you,

18:59.306 --> 19:01.274
behind a wall,
Lady Cray Cray?

19:01.308 --> 19:02.542
Unbelievable.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.811
Aah!

19:04.844 --> 19:05.845
What's up, girl?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.514
We're meant to be
together.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.250
Aah!

19:10.283 --> 19:12.385
Josh, if you don't get me
out here in three seconds,

19:12.419 --> 19:15.788
I promise you, I will go
full-on Wreck-It Ralph!

19:15.822 --> 19:19.292
I'm guessing
this is your guy?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.360
Yeah, that's him.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.661
Want me
to get him out of there?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.363
Hang on. I just want to see
what he does.
Three, two,

19:23.396 --> 19:24.597
...one!

19:43.650 --> 19:44.651
Yeah, yeah.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.886
I think it's time to get him
out of there. Yeah.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.959
Hang on. Why are we watching
"Danger Mountain Two"?

19:52.992 --> 19:55.962
'Cause Dad ruined
"Danger Mountain One."

19:55.995 --> 19:57.730
Well, it's basically
the same plot

19:57.764 --> 20:00.199
except the mountain explodes
at the end.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.506
Hey!
Dad, how was it?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
It sucked.

20:07.907 --> 20:08.941
Did you go
to the escape room?

20:08.975 --> 20:10.643
Yep.
Almost died.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.878
Well,
how was Rebecca?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.012
She's psychotic.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.548
Feel sorry for the next idiot
that gets stuck with her.

20:20.787 --> 20:21.888
Is this seat taken?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.958
It is now.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.560
Mm.
You smell good.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.596
Ah, cologne sandwich.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.866
You're funny.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.940
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:40.973 --> 20:44.477
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:44.511 --> 20:46.679
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:46.713 --> 20:48.014
* Do, do, do, do

20:48.047 --> 20:51.818
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:51.851 --> 20:54.887
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:54.921 --> 20:56.923
* I just don't want no...
