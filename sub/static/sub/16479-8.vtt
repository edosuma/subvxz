WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.126
Babe, can you help me finish
this thank you card

00:03.128 --> 00:05.762
to Asha Auntie?
She got us... that.

00:05.764 --> 00:08.065
SCHMIDT:
That porpoise porn?

00:08.067 --> 00:10.734
Yeah.
"Best, comma, Cece and Schimdt."

00:10.736 --> 00:12.102
All we're gonna give her
is a "Best, comma"?

00:12.104 --> 00:13.170
Come on, she's my mom's sister.

00:13.172 --> 00:14.972
Well, she should have
stuck to the registry.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.174
You know who hasn't even
gotten us a present yet?

00:17.176 --> 00:18.742
I have a year.
He has a year.

00:18.744 --> 00:19.476
I have a year!
(pounds table)

00:19.478 --> 00:21.144
All right, everyone.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.446
Report to
the principal's office,

00:22.448 --> 00:24.815
where I will be sitting
behind the desk because...

00:25.751 --> 00:27.451
I might be principal!
Congrats!

00:27.453 --> 00:29.353
That's great!
What do you mean,
could be principal?

00:29.355 --> 00:31.254
Well, I just had a very
interesting talk

00:31.256 --> 00:32.589
with my boss, Genevieve.

00:32.591 --> 00:33.790
Jess,

00:33.792 --> 00:35.625
I am dying.

00:35.627 --> 00:36.793
What? Oh, my God!

00:36.795 --> 00:38.628
Dying to leave Banyon Canyon

00:38.630 --> 00:41.598
and launch my own
elementary school at sea.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.934
Oh. You scared the
bejesus out of me.

00:43.936 --> 00:45.302
I've wanted this forever

00:45.304 --> 00:47.270
and I came so close
at my last school.

00:47.272 --> 00:50.007
Like, champagne
and Prosecco close.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.875
So, if you find marijuana
in a locker, it's yours now.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.810
Ours now. It could just be part
of the loft.

00:53.812 --> 00:55.679
We could just put it in a...

00:55.681 --> 00:57.047
Congratulations.

00:57.049 --> 00:59.149
You just got yourself two weeks
detention, Mr. Miller.

00:59.151 --> 01:00.984
What? But I didn't do anything!

01:00.986 --> 01:03.186
I didn't do anything!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.354
(sighs)

01:04.356 --> 01:06.423
¶ ¶

01:09.695 --> 01:11.128
Principal, that's great.
I'm really proud of you.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.129
And now you're
almost gonna make

01:12.131 --> 01:13.196
what normal people make.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.664
But I'm not even in it
for the cabbage.

01:14.666 --> 01:15.999
I want to change lives.

01:16.001 --> 01:17.701
And finally,
I can implement

01:17.703 --> 01:19.903
some of my programs school-wide,
like the math decathlon--

01:19.905 --> 01:20.971
The demathlon.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.005
A-ha!

01:22.007 --> 01:23.140
(Winston laughing)

01:23.142 --> 01:24.074
You see this whole time,

01:24.076 --> 01:25.042
y'all thought you were
having breakfast

01:25.044 --> 01:26.576
with Winston,

01:26.578 --> 01:29.446
but it turns out y'all been
sitting with James Wonder.

01:31.016 --> 01:32.416
I'm talking about my alias.

01:32.418 --> 01:33.316
See, I'm thinking about

01:33.318 --> 01:34.885
applying for undercover work.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.253
That sounds
incredibly dangerous.

01:36.255 --> 01:37.254
Well, not if I go deep enough

01:37.256 --> 01:39.056
into my undercover character.

01:39.058 --> 01:39.990
I've been practicing

01:39.992 --> 01:41.658
on y'all unknowin' asses.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.427
I combined the names of

01:43.429 --> 01:46.096
my favorite singers:
Stevie Wonder

01:46.098 --> 01:48.265
and James Blunt.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.667
And I put those together
to create a different name

01:50.669 --> 01:52.536
as my alias, James Wonder.

01:52.538 --> 01:54.838
I'm worried you're not
the undercover type of guy.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.872
I feel like

01:55.874 --> 01:56.907
if you had the ability

01:56.909 --> 01:58.341
to pretend to be someone else,

01:58.343 --> 02:00.844
you would have made that
decision a long time ago.

02:00.846 --> 02:01.945
I feel like that
sounded harsh,

02:01.947 --> 02:03.013
but it's only

02:03.015 --> 02:04.081
'cause I care about you.

02:05.117 --> 02:06.783
JESS:
<i> I love Parents' Day!</i>

02:06.785 --> 02:09.786
Matching names
to e-mail addresses,

02:09.788 --> 02:12.022
puttin' big people
in little chairs.

02:12.024 --> 02:15.625
Admiring all that
sweet daddy derriere.

02:15.627 --> 02:16.760
Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.929
Good. More for me. Ooh.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.730
That is Ed Warner.

02:20.732 --> 02:22.032
President of the
parent's council.

02:22.034 --> 02:23.400
You're gonna need his vote

02:23.402 --> 02:24.935
if you want to
become principal, so...

02:24.937 --> 02:26.303
Okay, did you talk me up?

02:26.305 --> 02:27.971
Absolutely not.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.941
School politics gets messy and
as my grandmother used to say,

02:30.943 --> 02:33.477
"You don't get dirty
till after 6:30."

02:33.479 --> 02:34.945
Piece of cake. Parents love me.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.913
Ed!

02:36.915 --> 02:38.448
Oh, are-are you okay?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.884
(chuckling):
Sorry, I was, uh,

02:40.886 --> 02:42.052
moved to tears by the...

02:42.054 --> 02:43.253
second grader's self-portraits.

02:43.255 --> 02:44.721
I cannot believe

02:44.723 --> 02:46.490
you are gonna abandon us
next year.

02:46.492 --> 02:47.924
Oh...
I'm like,
"Ah, don't go!"

02:47.926 --> 02:49.226
(imitating Genevieve):
I can keep the accent

02:49.228 --> 02:51.962
so you'll barely notice
she's gone.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.096
(chuckles awkwardly)

02:53.098 --> 02:54.931
Prince Henry,
pet me corgi.

02:54.933 --> 02:56.066
Wow.

02:56.068 --> 02:58.602
Um, Ed, have you
met our vice principal?

02:58.604 --> 03:00.103
Jessica Day.
I'm a big fan of your work

03:00.105 --> 03:02.806
and by your work,
I mean the child you created.

03:02.808 --> 03:03.673
Not to suggest that

03:03.675 --> 03:05.308
it was work making her.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.676
I'm sure it was fun.

03:06.678 --> 03:07.677
I mean...

03:07.679 --> 03:08.311
I hope it was fun.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.312
Ed, if you're gonna

03:09.314 --> 03:10.313
ask me sex advice,

03:10.315 --> 03:12.249
please buy me a
glass of wine first.

03:12.251 --> 03:13.517
(Jess chuckles)

03:13.519 --> 03:15.118
(clears throat)

03:15.120 --> 03:16.353
Anyway, switching gears.

03:16.355 --> 03:19.256
I'd love to discuss the,
uh, principal vacancy.

03:19.258 --> 03:20.524
As would I.

03:20.526 --> 03:22.459
N-Not now.
Now's not a great time.

03:22.461 --> 03:24.094
I have, um,

03:24.096 --> 03:26.163
uh...

03:27.099 --> 03:29.132
Good-bye.

03:29.134 --> 03:31.601
You beefed it, love.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.203
You beefed it hard.

03:33.205 --> 03:36.840
(blender whirring)

03:36.842 --> 03:40.010
Is that the Vitalstir 3,000
from my registry?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.011
Oh, no, I've had--

03:41.013 --> 03:42.946
I've had this forever.
It came out last year.

03:42.948 --> 03:44.114
Did it?

03:44.116 --> 03:45.182
I've had it for a year.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.051
No, I'm just doing
what I always do.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.486
Nicky Miller makin', uh,

03:49.488 --> 03:51.855
his famous guacamole.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.391
Like I always do.

03:54.393 --> 03:56.793
Nick Miller's
famous guacamole.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.199
(blender whirring)

04:02.201 --> 04:03.567
See ya later.

04:04.636 --> 04:06.903
I'll call you
when it's done!

04:08.006 --> 04:10.207
Fine.
(blender stops)

04:10.209 --> 04:11.208
It's from your registry.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.976
I bought it,
I brought it home

04:12.978 --> 04:14.978
but I can't give it to you.

04:14.980 --> 04:17.681
I am freaking out
about what to get you.

04:17.683 --> 04:20.917
Well, Nick why don't you just
give us this blender

04:20.919 --> 04:22.986
that's<i> on</i> the list
of stuff that I want?

04:22.988 --> 04:24.888
Because I feel trapped
by this registry.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.223
It's a list made by robots.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.825
Nick, not everything is robots!

04:28.827 --> 04:31.228
Winston puts one walkie-talkie
into a mailbox...

04:31.230 --> 04:33.897
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Thank you for your letter.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.932
Yum!

04:36.868 --> 04:38.668
(laughing quietly)

04:38.670 --> 04:40.503
I just-- you guys
are like my family.

04:40.505 --> 04:41.938
I want to get you
something great.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.107
Something unique,
personal.

04:44.109 --> 04:46.009
Oh, Nick.

04:46.011 --> 04:49.779
And while you clearly don't
understand what a registry is...

04:49.781 --> 04:52.148
(sighs)
I appreciate the sentiment.

04:52.784 --> 04:54.150
Nick...

04:55.120 --> 04:57.754
I don't say this lightly.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.689
I release you from the registry.

04:59.691 --> 05:00.523
Great.

05:00.525 --> 05:01.925
Buy us a gift of your choosing.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.093
What-what I want to get you.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.427
Whatever you want.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.528
The world is yours.

05:05.530 --> 05:07.197
Fly, my little hummingbird.

05:10.068 --> 05:12.002
'Cause I can get you anything.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.205
Oh...
this was a double-edged coin.

05:19.478 --> 05:20.944
WINSTON:
Excuse me?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.912
Can you tell me where
I can find my son's cubby?

05:22.914 --> 05:23.913
Winston!

05:23.915 --> 05:24.981
What are you doing here?

05:24.983 --> 05:26.283
And before you answer
that question,

05:26.285 --> 05:27.284
get out of here!

05:27.286 --> 05:28.285
Winston?

05:28.287 --> 05:29.286
Can't you read?

05:29.288 --> 05:29.953
You said I couldn't do it,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.788
but I did it.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.090
I am deep undercover right now.

05:34.092 --> 05:35.725
No one's gonna believe
you're a parent here.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.093
ED:
Jimmy-dubs!

05:37.095 --> 05:38.061
Where'd you go?

05:38.063 --> 05:39.596
I needed a refill
on the java, E-dawg.

05:39.598 --> 05:40.297
(chuckles)

05:40.299 --> 05:42.165
JESS:
Oh, my goodness!

05:42.167 --> 05:43.400
I see you've already met

05:43.402 --> 05:44.634
and also, already have

05:44.636 --> 05:46.069
'90s hip-hop nicknames
for each other.

05:46.071 --> 05:47.737
Genevieve, this is James Wonder.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.939
Hey.
A potential new dad.

05:49.941 --> 05:50.940
He's a landscape architect.

05:50.942 --> 05:52.742
Oh....
And father of Asher.

05:52.744 --> 05:54.611
And husband of?

05:54.613 --> 05:57.013
I-- I'm a widower.

05:57.015 --> 05:58.848
Oh, oh...

05:58.850 --> 06:00.083
Yeah. Yeah,

06:00.085 --> 06:01.985
she, um...

06:01.987 --> 06:03.453
she got squished.

06:03.455 --> 06:04.020
Squished?

06:04.022 --> 06:05.121
Mm-hmm.

06:05.123 --> 06:07.324
Did she? Did she?

06:07.326 --> 06:08.992
Okay, James.
Uh, let's leave now

06:08.994 --> 06:09.993
so I can show you

06:09.995 --> 06:11.361
the school's landscaping.

06:11.363 --> 06:12.462
ED:
Wait, actually,

06:12.464 --> 06:13.797
I have a stubborn back yard.

06:13.799 --> 06:15.465
Uh, I don't want
to bring in frogs,

06:15.467 --> 06:17.000
but if I could

06:17.002 --> 06:18.601
attract frogs...

06:18.603 --> 06:20.670
Very common situation
in our business.

06:20.672 --> 06:21.805
You need a well.

06:21.807 --> 06:22.939
A well?

06:22.941 --> 06:23.940
Oh.

06:23.942 --> 06:25.141
Well,

06:25.143 --> 06:27.711
you need to let me
buy you a bottle of wine

06:27.713 --> 06:29.045
and pick your brain
about all this.

06:29.047 --> 06:30.347
(laughing):
That sounds good, E-dawg.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.348
We should...

06:31.350 --> 06:33.950
But-- but right now,

06:33.952 --> 06:35.552
I should get going.
Yeah.

06:35.554 --> 06:37.987
I got a butt load of koi fish
in the back of my truck

06:37.989 --> 06:39.022
that need bonding.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.790
Please, let me show you out.

06:41.893 --> 06:43.693
Take my hand. Oh, God.
Did I say breast?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.795
I meant-- I meant hand.

06:45.797 --> 06:47.030
JESS:
Uh, hey. Hey, Ed.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.798
I'd love to
circle back around

06:48.800 --> 06:50.133
to that principal conversation.

06:50.135 --> 06:51.568
Let me just stop you
there, Miss Day.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.636
Um, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

06:53.638 --> 06:55.839
but I think I speak
for every parent

06:55.841 --> 06:58.241
at Banyon Canyon
when I say,

06:58.243 --> 06:59.576
you're just
not a good fit.

06:59.578 --> 07:01.010
Wh-What?

07:01.012 --> 07:02.345
I am a perfect fit.

07:02.347 --> 07:04.080
I have my reasons.
(chuckles)

07:04.082 --> 07:05.982
Excuse me, I have, uh...

07:05.984 --> 07:07.584
(smacks lips)
Good-bye.

07:13.658 --> 07:15.425
I'm making this for Genevieve.
I'm... I gotta convince her

07:15.427 --> 07:16.426
to make my case to Ed.

07:16.428 --> 07:19.162
My man, Ed. Listen Jess,

07:19.164 --> 07:21.364
I could go ahead and give
him a call if you like.

07:21.366 --> 07:23.099
All you have to do
is say the word.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.935
No, no, no, no. This is
no country for James Wonder.

07:25.937 --> 07:27.871
I'm not having you go
undercover at school again.

07:27.873 --> 07:29.706
No offense, but you kind of
fell out of your dress

07:29.708 --> 07:30.907
when Genevieve
came on to you.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.209
I did get rattled.
I have a girlfriend,

07:33.211 --> 07:34.711
and I adore Ally.

07:34.713 --> 07:37.113
But everything else I'm
doing seems to be working

07:37.115 --> 07:39.582
because Ed loves me.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.751
You know, he wants James
to landscape his yard.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.121
So I drew him four sketches.

07:45.123 --> 07:47.424
Wow. Winston, there are
actually really good.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.926
I don't remember
drawing these.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.996
I woke up this morning, and
they were under my pillow.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.367
(groans)
Hey, Nick...

07:57.369 --> 07:59.235
Would you be interested in
rubble from old Yankee Stadium?

07:59.237 --> 08:01.704
What, for my
rubble collection?

08:01.706 --> 08:04.073
I'm having a really hard time
finding something for you.

08:04.075 --> 08:05.809
I thought I was just
gonna go on the Internet,

08:05.811 --> 08:07.444
but the Internet is
so different now.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.945
Have you been on
the Internet lately?

08:08.947 --> 08:10.547
How drunk are you?

08:10.549 --> 08:12.081
I remember when the
Internet used to just be

08:12.083 --> 08:13.917
a naked lady and a bunch
of dancing hamsters.

08:13.919 --> 08:16.085
How drunk are you, Nick?
I literally haven't had
one thing to drink.

08:16.087 --> 08:17.720
How many drinks
have you had?
Give me a breathalyzer.

08:17.722 --> 08:20.957
It feels like
you're drunk.
Z-Y-X-N-L-P-A.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.625
You're hammered.
I'm drunk.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.227
Nick, whatever you get us,
we're going to love.

08:24.229 --> 08:25.795
It... it doesn't matter.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.330
I don't know what
to get you,

08:27.332 --> 08:28.932
and it matters,
it<i> matters! </i>
It doesn't matter.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.633
It doesn't matter!

08:30.635 --> 08:32.135
Just get us something!

08:32.137 --> 08:33.102
(shouting):
There's a registry.

08:33.104 --> 08:37.106
You go on it,
and you pick something!

08:37.108 --> 08:39.142
Now you've got Schmidt
all cranked up.
You're cranked up?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.010
Yeah, I got to go to the arcade
now and blow off steam!

08:41.012 --> 08:43.012
I didn't mean
to crank you up.

08:43.014 --> 08:45.348
Hey, Cece.
Hey, hey.

08:46.751 --> 08:48.751
I don't know what to do.

08:48.753 --> 08:50.687
I want to get you
something great,

08:50.689 --> 08:52.188
but I can't find anything
on the Internet.

08:52.190 --> 08:54.257
Here's the truth.
I'd give you my heart.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.025
I'd rip it out
of my chest but...

08:56.027 --> 08:58.294
but then I would
literally die.

08:58.296 --> 09:00.763
But you know that, you're
studying to be a nurse.

09:00.765 --> 09:02.365
No, I'm not.
You're already a nurse?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.367
Not a nurse.
But you went to college
didn't you?

09:04.369 --> 09:06.169
Why didn't you just
give us the Vitalstir?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.972
Because then it would just
end up in a landfill in a year

09:08.974 --> 09:11.441
when they come out
with a Vitalstir 3001.

09:11.443 --> 09:13.977
Well, I imagine
they'd go to 4000.

09:13.979 --> 09:15.678
Do you think that
they have made

09:15.680 --> 09:17.780
3,000 different
Vitalstir models?

09:17.782 --> 09:20.383
Do you really think they've
perfected this blender

09:20.385 --> 09:21.985
in four tries?

09:21.987 --> 09:24.020
You're not a nurse.
(laughs)

09:24.022 --> 09:26.789
Look, I know what you're
struggling with right now, okay?

09:26.791 --> 09:29.792
You want to get us
something that's unique.

09:29.794 --> 09:31.995
It's got to be great.
It's got to be from me to you.

09:31.997 --> 09:34.030
Alright, here's a little
exercise-- close your eyes.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.065
Now, first thing that
comes to your mind.

09:36.067 --> 09:40.570
Imagine something that is
unique, it's permanent.

09:40.572 --> 09:42.372
I got it!

09:43.842 --> 09:46.075
Okay, you got to open your eyes
before you go, you drunk.

09:46.077 --> 09:49.178
Let me give you the, uh, keys
so you can close up.

09:49.180 --> 09:53.049
Oh, no. I put two hands in
at the same time again.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.418
(straining)

09:55.420 --> 09:56.653
I did it again.

09:58.023 --> 10:00.590
I can't find this
James Wonder anywhere.

10:00.592 --> 10:02.825
I just wanted to say hi,

10:02.827 --> 10:05.194
and I want to send him
a password-protected video

10:05.196 --> 10:06.696
I thought he might enjoy.

10:06.698 --> 10:09.399
Well, I just brought you
a little gift.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.901
I know what you're doing.
Jess, I have told you

10:11.903 --> 10:13.903
I can't afford to get involved
in school politics.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.572
Please, Genevieve.
I'm begging you.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.908
There's no delicate way to say
this so I'm going to be...

10:18.910 --> 10:21.678
incredibly cruel.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.047
They don't like you.

10:24.049 --> 10:25.715
At all.
Ow.

10:25.717 --> 10:27.717
They despise you.
All right. I got it.

10:27.719 --> 10:30.053
"Get rid of Jess."
Yikes.

10:30.055 --> 10:31.120
These aren't my words, Jess.

10:31.122 --> 10:34.090
I'm just repeating
what I'm hearing.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.525
"Jess is the worst."

10:35.527 --> 10:37.860
Okay.
"Can't stand
the sight of her."

10:37.862 --> 10:39.195
Don't need all of it.
Do you understand
what I am saying?

10:39.197 --> 10:42.432
Yeah.
They've asked me to
move on with my search.

10:43.568 --> 10:46.402
Wait a minute.
Huh?

10:46.404 --> 10:47.704
Would you talk me up to Ed
if I could tell you

10:47.706 --> 10:50.440
where he was
having dinner?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.976
With James Wonder?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.381
Winston.

10:58.383 --> 11:01.384
You need to say
the words, Jess.

11:01.386 --> 11:02.552
I need your help.

11:02.554 --> 11:05.622
I need your help, who?

11:07.392 --> 11:10.126
I need your help,
James Wonder.

11:12.731 --> 11:15.231
Well, then, my help
you shall have.

11:15.233 --> 11:17.200
What'd he say?
Is he going to help?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.606
Here is your mission. You're
going to go down to Brickfield

11:23.608 --> 11:26.142
and you're going to facilitate
a conversation

11:26.144 --> 11:28.578
about me with Ed...
My man.

11:28.580 --> 11:29.946
And Genevieve.
I'm out.

11:29.948 --> 11:33.916
Please, Winst--
James Wonder.

11:33.918 --> 11:35.284
She wants to
have sex with me.

11:35.286 --> 11:39.155
I know you love Ally, but
James Wonder is still grieving.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.457
Lean into the character.
This is your chance

11:41.459 --> 11:44.127
to prove that you can do
undercover work.

11:44.129 --> 11:46.863
Please?

11:46.865 --> 11:49.866
All right, I'll do it.
Under one condition.

11:49.868 --> 11:51.367
That I...

11:51.369 --> 11:54.170
No, I don't have
any conditions.
Okay.

11:55.373 --> 11:57.874
I<i> design </i>
all the landscaping,

11:57.876 --> 12:00.476
and my crew-- my crew,
they do all the dirty work.

12:00.478 --> 12:04.313
If you were my boss, I would be
employee of the month

12:04.315 --> 12:07.383
every single day.

12:07.385 --> 12:08.484
WINSTON (over phone speaker):
All right then.

12:08.486 --> 12:09.886
Oh, jeez, Genevieve,

12:09.888 --> 12:11.487
stop flirting, get to me!

12:11.489 --> 12:13.289
Are you shouting
at a podcast again, Jess?

12:13.291 --> 12:14.557
You know it can't
hear you, right?

12:14.559 --> 12:16.192
Shh!

12:16.194 --> 12:17.994
Speaking of bosses,

12:17.996 --> 12:20.129
Ms. Day has done
some amazing work.

12:20.131 --> 12:21.130
Strong disagree.

12:21.132 --> 12:22.799
Uh, what is your<i> ish </i>
with her?

12:22.801 --> 12:24.901
She sets our kids up
for failure.

12:24.903 --> 12:25.968
What?!

12:25.970 --> 12:27.637
ED:
This ridiculous

12:27.639 --> 12:29.672
math decathlon... ugh!

12:29.674 --> 12:31.641
It is competitive
and demeaning.

12:31.643 --> 12:34.477
It is hard enough out there
for these kids.

12:34.479 --> 12:36.312
Affluent children
in Los Angeles

12:36.314 --> 12:38.347
do have it hard.
Exactly.

12:38.349 --> 12:40.817
Samanthia bombed that dumb
thing, never got a medal,

12:40.819 --> 12:42.318
and now she's lost
her appetite for<i> soosh!</i>

12:42.320 --> 12:43.653
That's what he's mad at?

12:43.655 --> 12:46.222
My version of the demathlon
is way less rigorous

12:46.224 --> 12:48.491
than the South Korean teacher
I copied it from.

12:48.493 --> 12:51.027
Either bring the phone over here
where we can hear it,

12:51.029 --> 12:52.395
or stop talking to it.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.098
He's saying that unless
I drop the demathlon,

12:55.100 --> 12:56.265
I'll never be principal.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.767
GENEVIEVE: James.

12:57.769 --> 13:01.904
I am trouble
after two glasses.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.040
So why don't you
pour me a third?

13:04.042 --> 13:06.843
(laughing heartily)
(nervous chuckle)

13:06.845 --> 13:08.878
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it.
Okay. Mm-hmm. O-Okay.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.946
Do it. Do it!
Okay. Okay.

13:09.948 --> 13:12.782
(laughing)

13:12.784 --> 13:15.084
Stop it! Stop it!

13:15.086 --> 13:17.520
I'm going to get crazy.

13:17.522 --> 13:18.688
You're making me crazy.

13:18.690 --> 13:21.557
I did it. Best present ever.

13:21.559 --> 13:24.127
Please. I'm trying to eavesdrop
on Winston's alter ego.

13:24.129 --> 13:25.528
(chuckling) Oh...
GENEVIEVE: James.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.463
Hmm?
You seem troubled.

13:27.465 --> 13:30.266
No, I don't.
You must be holding
a lot of sadness

13:30.268 --> 13:31.768
in your legs.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.371
I have hands like
a bonobo-- strong.

13:35.373 --> 13:37.240
Oh, wow.
(nervous chuckle)

13:37.242 --> 13:38.641
There we go. Ooh.

13:38.643 --> 13:39.809
Aah!
Very good.

13:39.811 --> 13:42.979
Ow! Now, no!
I have a girlfriend.

13:42.981 --> 13:45.448
Her name is Ally.
No. No. No. No. No.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.884
Wasn't your wife
recently squished?

13:47.886 --> 13:50.086
Yeah. That.that happened.

13:50.088 --> 13:51.721
She was indeed...

13:51.723 --> 13:54.223
But then, we cremated her.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.458
And we, we,

13:55.460 --> 13:57.727
we had to dry her out first.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.796
Ugh. He's scrambling
like a damn egg!

13:59.798 --> 14:01.130
I got to get in there.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.932
Wait, you got to
see my gift!

14:02.934 --> 14:04.834
Who are you, James Wonder?

14:07.005 --> 14:09.639
(chuckles)

14:09.641 --> 14:14.143
I'm just a... a combination
of my two favorite singers.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.979
I'm about to gift
your brains to pieces.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.347
You got to real pull-the-rip-
cord-while-still-in-the-plane

14:18.349 --> 14:19.615
kind of vibe, Nick.

14:19.617 --> 14:22.952
It's a little something
from me... to you.

14:22.954 --> 14:25.421
All right.
Or, more accurately,

14:25.423 --> 14:27.590
on me.

14:27.592 --> 14:28.825
(laughing)
Check it out.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.393
I got the best gift.

14:32.363 --> 14:33.696
It is your faces,

14:33.698 --> 14:35.164
but it's not your bodies.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.333
I didn't have a
full body shot so...

14:37.335 --> 14:39.135
they picked the bodies.

14:39.137 --> 14:40.536
SCHMIDT:
Is that<i> Pretty Woman? </i>
This is from the movie

14:40.538 --> 14:42.371
<i> Pretty Woman</i>
and it's on me forever.

14:42.373 --> 14:43.940
(laughs)

14:43.942 --> 14:45.608
Say something.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.610
(nervous chuckle)

14:47.612 --> 14:48.644
Say something.

14:48.646 --> 14:50.513
It-it's cute, it's really cute.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.948
I really did it.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.050
Talk to me about
how happy you are.

14:54.052 --> 14:55.051
It's on me forever.

14:55.053 --> 14:56.118
SCHMIDT:
I know we're on you

14:56.120 --> 14:57.153
forever and ever,
until you're buried

14:57.155 --> 14:58.554
in a non-Jewish cemetery.

14:58.556 --> 15:00.289
CECE:
And now we-we owe you a...

15:00.291 --> 15:01.824
a thank you card.
Just don't know

15:01.826 --> 15:03.125
where I'm gonna find
the words to express

15:03.127 --> 15:05.895
all of the emotions
that I'm feeling right now.

15:05.897 --> 15:07.897
(laughs)

15:07.899 --> 15:09.131
I can't find anything

15:09.133 --> 15:12.034
about you online, James.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.502
Not even the darknet.

15:13.504 --> 15:15.037
Oh, I was gonna say,
you checked the darknet, yeah?

15:15.039 --> 15:17.406
I'm usually on there, they
usually got some stuff about me.

15:17.408 --> 15:19.408
Hey!
WINSTON:
Oh, thank God.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.178
Jess... ica Day.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.847
I can't believe you guys are
all at my favorite restaurant.

15:24.849 --> 15:26.682
Hey, does anyone have
a red landscaping truck?

15:26.684 --> 15:27.984
'Cause it's getting towed.

15:27.986 --> 15:30.019
Anyone?
Red landscaping truck?

15:30.021 --> 15:31.153
No, mine's white.
(clears throat)

15:31.155 --> 15:32.455
Well, it could be white.

15:33.858 --> 15:34.857
It's getting towed.

15:34.859 --> 15:37.493
I-I did take the red one today.

15:37.495 --> 15:38.661
Yeah, can't let that get towed.

15:38.663 --> 15:40.496
My crew is napping in the back.
Yup.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.699
Well...
(chuckling):
Hey.

15:43.701 --> 15:45.368
this is an unexpected treat.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.003
Well, I'm happy
to have ran into you

15:47.005 --> 15:50.072
because, um...
I've been thinking,

15:50.074 --> 15:51.374
and...

15:51.376 --> 15:57.013
I'm cancelling the demathlon.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.014
Really?

15:58.016 --> 16:00.583
Yeah.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.686
But I thought you
loved the math decathlon?

16:03.688 --> 16:05.955
It's a holdover from
my old public school days.

16:05.957 --> 16:08.958
It's unnecessarily competitive.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.127
Old habits die hard.

16:11.129 --> 16:12.461
That's true, you know,

16:12.463 --> 16:16.599
I still eat a ton of meat and
I've been vegetarian for years.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.067
Like, a ton.

16:18.069 --> 16:19.402
A ton of meat.

16:19.404 --> 16:21.103
I mean, I didn't
realize you were so amenable.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.072
Hey, actually,

16:23.074 --> 16:25.441
Samanthia loves puppets.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.043
What would you
say if I asked you

16:27.045 --> 16:28.945
to introduce ventriloquism
into the curriculum?

16:28.947 --> 16:31.180
And do less math?

16:32.383 --> 16:33.883
I'd say...

16:35.086 --> 16:37.954
(in puppet voice):
You got it!

16:37.956 --> 16:38.988
(clears throat)

16:38.990 --> 16:40.823
Great.
(both chuckle)

16:45.163 --> 16:48.764
"Sincerely"?
<i> "Sincerely"?</i>

16:48.766 --> 16:51.300
"Dear Nick,
thanks for the tattoo.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.270
Sincerely, S and Cece."
You guys hate my gift?

16:54.272 --> 16:56.505
No, we don't hate it, we love
it, I see it every time I blink.

16:56.507 --> 16:57.974
You guys want to see it?
It's okay.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.176
Ah, I'll show it anyhow.

17:00.178 --> 17:01.811
Check it out.
There's an ingrown hair

17:01.813 --> 17:04.013
that gives Cece a bit of
a Rudolph nose.

17:04.015 --> 17:05.748
And when I flex my feet

17:05.750 --> 17:07.016
it makes you guys fatter.
Look.

17:07.018 --> 17:09.251
Fat, look how fat your face
looks, Schmidt.

17:09.253 --> 17:11.187
(laughs) You have the
fattest face in the world.

17:11.189 --> 17:13.422
All right, stop it!
Stop the horror!

17:13.424 --> 17:14.623
We hate the gift.
It's disgusting.

17:14.625 --> 17:15.958
It is disgusting.

17:15.960 --> 17:16.993
You've ruined your leg.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.594
It is like you stole our souls.

17:18.596 --> 17:21.030
You depicted my wife
as a common street whore.

17:21.032 --> 17:22.164
Fine, you don't want it?

17:22.166 --> 17:25.001
You can't have it.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.268
I'll get it removed
and we can go about our lives

17:26.270 --> 17:27.636
again in a week.

17:27.638 --> 17:29.138
You know it costs,
like, two grand

17:29.140 --> 17:30.873
and takes a year
or something, right?

17:30.875 --> 17:35.978
Well, I did not know that.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.046
Okay?

17:37.048 --> 17:38.981
I didn't know that.

17:38.983 --> 17:40.983
Well, that really sucks for me.

17:40.985 --> 17:43.619
But fine,
then that's your present.

17:43.621 --> 17:44.787
That's not a present.
Look Nick,

17:44.789 --> 17:45.888
I appreciate you
trying to do something

17:45.890 --> 17:46.889
meaningful for us,

17:46.891 --> 17:48.791
but just give us
the blender you bought.

17:48.793 --> 17:50.126
Well, the jokes on you,
I burnt out the motor

17:50.128 --> 17:51.994
making a bubble gum smoothie.

17:51.996 --> 17:53.329
You're back on
the registry then.
I won't do it!

17:53.331 --> 17:55.231
It's a list made by robots.
Idiot!

17:55.233 --> 17:56.832
Trying to get me
something meaningful!

17:56.834 --> 17:58.167
The only thing
meaningful to me

17:58.169 --> 17:59.368
is the blender!

17:59.370 --> 18:00.836
Remember to bring your pets

18:00.838 --> 18:04.040
to school next week
for human zoo day.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.074
Yeah.

18:05.076 --> 18:06.308
Oh, and I'd also like

18:06.310 --> 18:07.910
to let everyone know
that we are switching back

18:07.912 --> 18:10.846
from this soap to this soap,
okay?

18:10.848 --> 18:12.048
So just be aware.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.215
Next,

18:13.217 --> 18:16.218
I would like to offer
my personal endorsement

18:16.220 --> 18:19.488
of Jessica Day
as our next principal.

18:19.490 --> 18:22.792
(applause)

18:24.729 --> 18:26.429
All right, well, first,
I'd love to open up the floor

18:26.431 --> 18:27.430
to questions.
Anybody?

18:27.432 --> 18:28.898
Oh, wow, okay.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.699
Can you get rid of the white
lines in the parking lot?

18:30.701 --> 18:32.201
They're very restrictive.

18:32.203 --> 18:34.103
I think they're for...
MAN 2:
Shouldn't we designate

18:34.105 --> 18:37.039
the green space
for European-style football?
WOMAN: And for Tofu Tuesday,

18:37.041 --> 18:39.875
can we get a more
balanced juice pairing?

18:39.877 --> 18:41.510
Didn't think I'd ever
see you again.

18:41.512 --> 18:43.279
I came to say good-bye.

18:43.281 --> 18:46.082
Asher and I are
moving to Colorado.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.250
Is that where Ally lives?
No.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.253
The city of Denver wants me
to landscape an entire mountain.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.756
It's a whole thing.
MAN 1:
How about once a week

18:53.758 --> 18:57.126
in the dining hall
we serve sushi<i> omakase? </i>
Oh, oh, okay.

18:57.128 --> 18:59.395
Guys, uh, plenty of time to run
our suggestions by her.

18:59.397 --> 19:02.431
But I assure you
she will be very amenable.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.133
She is a principal

19:04.135 --> 19:05.601
for the parents.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.169
Hmm?

19:10.074 --> 19:13.943
Uh, actually, um, no.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.244
I-I have to be honest here.

19:15.246 --> 19:17.279
I...

19:17.281 --> 19:18.948
that's not who I am.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.283
I'm not gonna be a principal
for the parents.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.551
(parents murmur)

19:22.553 --> 19:26.388
I'm gonna be a principal
for the kids.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.623
Look,

19:27.625 --> 19:29.058
you all love your kids

19:29.060 --> 19:31.827
and they're yours to raise,

19:31.829 --> 19:34.330
but I'm an educator
and I know how to educate.

19:34.332 --> 19:35.498
Colby,

19:35.500 --> 19:36.999
your son Vince
had the handwriting

19:37.001 --> 19:38.501
of a Hungarian doctor.

19:38.503 --> 19:40.236
Mm-hmm.
And that's why I encouraged him

19:40.238 --> 19:43.272
to sign up for calligraphy
comics after school.

19:43.274 --> 19:45.808
He didn't want to do it,
but look at him now.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.644
I can finally read the captions
for his disturbing images.
And Molly,

19:48.646 --> 19:49.578
do you remember how terrified

19:49.580 --> 19:51.147
Beatrice was of public speaking

19:51.149 --> 19:52.581
in the second grade?

19:52.583 --> 19:54.917
That's why I bumped her up
to fourth grade debate team.

19:54.919 --> 19:56.919
Yeah, she made a toast
at my brother's wedding.

19:56.921 --> 20:00.089
I mean, besides one
racist joke, she killed.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.790
Ed, when I met Samanthia,

20:01.792 --> 20:04.660
math was
her least favorite subject.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.029
Now she's doing fractions
and loving it.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.765
And yeah, she's didn't
win a demathlon medal

20:09.767 --> 20:11.133
and I know that stung,

20:11.135 --> 20:13.002
but it made her
want to get better.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.937
And isn't that
what school is for?

20:14.939 --> 20:16.772
Look, I think
challenging your children

20:16.774 --> 20:19.175
prepares them
for the real world.

20:19.177 --> 20:23.312
And if given the chance,
I think I can help your kids

20:23.314 --> 20:26.815
and this school
reach its full potential.

20:26.817 --> 20:28.350
And if that's not what you want,

20:28.352 --> 20:30.486
and I'm not the right fit,

20:30.488 --> 20:33.556
then I can live with that.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.994
(applause)

20:38.996 --> 20:41.430
¶ ¶

20:49.707 --> 20:51.840
Genevieve, I got you something.

20:51.842 --> 20:53.909
Something to remember me by.

20:56.347 --> 20:58.414
Oh.

21:07.191 --> 21:09.091
Shouldn't this be in a pot?

21:09.093 --> 21:11.060
Oh, Genevieve.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.528
You don't know anything.

21:12.530 --> 21:15.164
(chuckles)

21:15.166 --> 21:17.399
I'm so glad I'm doing this.
(tattoo machine buzzing)

21:17.401 --> 21:18.934
You know, it was weird
this morning in the shower.

21:18.936 --> 21:21.036
Just me and tattoo yous.

21:21.038 --> 21:22.838
I was the only one
that was naked.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.707
JESS: You know, we could
loan you the money

21:24.709 --> 21:25.674
to remove it?

21:25.676 --> 21:27.042
I don't like debts.

21:27.044 --> 21:28.510
(groans)

21:28.512 --> 21:29.878
All finished, guys.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.180
SCHMIDT: Glad we all talked
ourselves into thinking

21:31.182 --> 21:33.182
that this somehow makes
the nightmare better.

21:33.184 --> 21:34.950
WINSTON: Nick, I just want
to say I really...

21:34.952 --> 21:38.020
NICK:<i> I'm not getting the damn</i>
<i> cat on my leg. Drop it.</i>
