00:45.610 --> 00:48.004
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

[groans]

01:02.105 --> 01:03.280
-Shephard.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.455
-Are you nearby?

01:04.499 --> 01:05.369
-Why, what happened?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.196
-I think our little passenger

01:06.240 --> 01:07.937
may not be doing so well.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.070
[dog barking and whining]

01:10.113 --> 01:12.507
-Okay, hang tight Doc,
I'll be right there.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.266
-What, no coffee boss?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.571
-Tell me they're not out?

01:33.615 --> 01:35.095
-Don't worry, there's plenty,

01:35.138 --> 01:36.574
unfortunately it didn't
make the trip back.

01:36.618 --> 01:37.575
-Well that's a bummer.

01:37.619 --> 01:38.924
-You fella's take a break

01:38.968 --> 01:40.317
and go get yourself some,

01:40.361 --> 01:41.753
I'll cover your post
till you get back.

01:41.797 --> 01:45.453
-Thank you sir.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.411
-And keep those weapons

01:47.455 --> 01:49.413
out of sight, no need to alarm
any of the passengers.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.849
-Roger that sir!

01:50.893 --> 01:52.764
Hey you want us to bring you
back
anything boss?

01:52.808 --> 01:55.289
-Yeah, how about a bit of peace,

01:55.332 --> 01:58.422
a little quite, and a whole lot
of Christmas cheer.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.684
-I'm not sure that's
on the menu boss.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.165
-Well then, just give me
some hot chocolate.

02:02.209 --> 02:05.168
-Want whipped cream with that?

02:05.212 --> 02:08.519
-Sure, why not,
Just be back in 30.

[dog whining and barking]

02:24.187 --> 02:27.016
-How's he doing Doc?

02:27.059 --> 02:30.062
Not ill I hope?

02:30.106 --> 02:31.499
I hate to deliver him
to the top brass

02:31.542 --> 02:32.978
knowing he got sick on my watch,

02:33.022 --> 02:34.197
they'd have my hide for sure.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.981
-Health-wise he's fine,

02:36.025 --> 02:38.201
a prime example of
Canis lupus familiaris.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.463
-What is it then?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
-Emotionally he's just a bit
off,

02:41.509 --> 02:44.164
He's anxious, he's stressed,

02:44.207 --> 02:46.166
maybe even a little terrified,
and I can't blame him,

02:46.209 --> 02:48.820
he has been under lock and key
ever since they discovered his

02:48.864 --> 02:50.779
special talent at Fort Meyers.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.085
-You know, I don't get it.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.609
-Get what?

02:54.652 --> 02:56.741
-Well, if this little dog
can do what they say he can

02:56.785 --> 02:58.047
why doesn't he just figure

02:58.090 --> 02:59.396
a way out of there and be gone?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.398
-Because, dog's brains don't

03:01.442 --> 03:03.400
operate the same way ours do,

03:03.444 --> 03:04.662
that's probably why we
like them so much.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.055
Unlike our species

03:06.098 --> 03:08.753
canines are loyal and their love
is unconditional.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.712
-Man's best friend, huh?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.368
-That's what they say,
and frankly I believe it.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.239
-Wonder how he feels about us?

03:16.283 --> 03:17.675
-We haven't heard him?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.503
-Oh no! No, not at all.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.678
Poking him with needles,

03:20.722 --> 03:22.376
keeping him locked up
in that cage,

03:22.419 --> 03:23.942
shippin' him down to
the scientific lab

03:23.986 --> 03:25.030
for further study,

03:25.074 --> 03:26.554
probably for the rest of his
life,

03:26.597 --> 03:28.686
no, we haven't heard him,
not at all.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.340
We haven't helped him either.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.603
Heck, we haven't even
given him a name.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.344
-It is not up to me.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.737
It's not up to you either.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.868
I am a hired hand in this,

03:36.912 --> 03:38.218
the same as everybody else.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.045
It's not our job
to ask questions.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.438
It is our job to deliver

03:41.482 --> 03:43.614
the specimen where the army
wants him to go.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.877
[dog whining]

03:45.921 --> 03:48.706
-So shall it be little fellah.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.492
Merry Christmas to ya.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.627
-What do you two have?

03:56.671 --> 03:57.976
-Two coffees, cream and sugar.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.239
-Oh, and hot chocolate,

03:59.282 --> 04:00.240
plenty of whipped cream.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.067
-Coming right up.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.547
-I don't get it Don,

04:03.591 --> 04:05.157
I've been assigned
to Vice Presidents,

04:05.201 --> 04:08.291
high ranking honchos,
rock stars, movie stars,

04:08.335 --> 04:10.946
heck, even Dolly Parton.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.817
But a mangy mutt?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.167
This is just downright
degrading.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.082
-Look, men in black.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.171
-Come on buddy, cheer up.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.303
Maybe next time they'll put us

04:20.347 --> 04:22.262
in charge of a kitty cat

04:22.305 --> 04:26.396
or a-a bunny w-w-wabbit-t-t-t.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.268
-Hardy har har.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.399
-Here's your coffee,

04:29.443 --> 04:31.532
and hot chocolate
will be right up.

-Oh thanks Doc!

04:51.900 --> 04:53.815
-I'll get it reopened.

04:53.858 --> 04:57.514
-Don, Mike, the dog out, he's comin' your way, grab him!

04:57.558 --> 04:58.646
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!

04:58.689 --> 05:00.474
-Got it sir,
He won't get past us.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.998
Come on!

have you seen a dog?

-Listen up, it's the FBI,
has anyone seen a dog?

05:45.040 --> 05:48.739
-This is very important.

-I saw him, I saw him!

05:50.959 --> 05:52.743
-Where'd he go honey?
You can tell us.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.224
-You aren't going to hurt him,
are you?

05:55.267 --> 05:56.791
-No.
-No, no, no.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.446
-We just need to find him
before he falls off the train.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.319
-Thanks sweetie.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.846
-Mama, he spoke to me.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.109
-Yeah, the FBI man, I saw him,
yeah, honey.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.809
-No, mama, the dog,
he spoke to me.

-There he is.
-Go, go, go.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.478
[dog barks]

06:49.365 --> 06:51.541
-Sorry sir, he jumped off
before we could get him.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.760
-It's not your fault.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.457
-It's nobody's fault,
he just got away.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.806
-You do realize how important

06:55.850 --> 06:57.242
that animal is to
national defense?

06:57.286 --> 06:58.635
We have to retrieve him
immediately.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.941
-I know, I know.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.899
-If I was a dog
I'd want to get out of the cold

07:01.943 --> 07:03.161
before I froze to death.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.467
-That probably means
that he's down there

07:04.511 --> 07:06.251
in that valley somewhere
below the snow line.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.165
So what do we do?

07:07.209 --> 07:08.471
-Get on the horn with Sat Com,

07:08.515 --> 07:09.733
tell them what's happened.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.431
Get pictures of that animal
out to all

07:11.474 --> 07:13.041
the surrounding municipalities.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.999
I want every law enforcement
agent looking for our specimen

07:15.043 --> 07:16.174
by night fall.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.349
-That's a tall order sir!

07:17.393 --> 07:18.829
-Well, make it happen gentlemen!

07:18.873 --> 07:19.917
And somebody get a chopper
in here

07:19.961 --> 07:21.353
and get us off this train.

I know you can do it

10:34.329 --> 10:36.461
make it happen, for me.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.398
-Oh come on!

11:00.442 --> 11:01.878
We're not finished yet,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.488
-Janelle wants to see me hit
again.

11:03.532 --> 11:04.576
-Well, unless you want to

11:04.620 --> 11:05.708
play invisible baseball

11:05.752 --> 11:06.578
we're toast.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.319
That was our last ball.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.799
-You can't top that hit Ronnie.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.801
-Yeah, but now somebody
has to go and get the ball

11:11.845 --> 11:13.585
from the Kluger house.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.675
-What are you, afraid Isaac?

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
Nobody's lived there for years.

11:17.764 --> 11:18.721
-I'm not afraid,

11:18.765 --> 11:20.244
I just don't want to do it.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.681
Besides, Johnny Bender

11:21.724 --> 11:22.812
was walking by it once

11:22.856 --> 11:23.857
and he heard screams

11:23.900 --> 11:25.423
coming from inside.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.990
-And you believe him of course?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.600
-Word is, old man Kluger used to

11:28.644 --> 11:30.341
stuff dead animals for a living.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.169
-Like chickens and frogs?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.824
-No, big animals like

11:34.868 --> 11:37.261
tigers, hawks,
and mountain lions.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.610
-That's not true.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.264
-It is, my dad told me

11:40.308 --> 11:41.831
never to go in there.

11:41.875 --> 11:42.919
-Why?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.529
-Because it's not safe, that's
why.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.922
He says there could still be

11:45.966 --> 11:47.576
sharp needles lying around.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.925
-Parents worry too much.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.927
All that's in that
house is dust.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.537
-Oh yeah, so why don't you just

11:52.581 --> 11:54.365
go in and get the ball then?

11:54.409 --> 11:55.758
-Okay, I will.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.107
-You're kidding right?

11:57.151 --> 11:59.066
-No way, I'd like to see ya.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
-Okay, I'll get the ball,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.025
there's nothin' to it.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.897
-Jamie, you don't
have to do this.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.115
-Yeah I do.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.551
-But what if old man Kluger's

12:06.595 --> 12:07.901
ghost is still in there?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.772
-Well, then I'll say,
"Hello." for ya.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.382
-Okay, but if you don't come
back

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
I'm keeping your glove.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.038
-Shut up Ronnie.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.866
-If you're going I'm going too.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.563
-Nope, you're going to
stay right here.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.870
-Please, I've never been in

12:20.914 --> 12:23.046
a haunted house before.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.787
-Hugo, it's not haunted.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.484
-Pretty please.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.661
-Okay, okay, but you stay behind
me all right?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.794
-I will. Promise.

12:31.838 --> 12:32.969
-Oh man, I can't wait to see

12:33.013 --> 12:34.318
the look on your mom's face.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.624
Sorry to be the bearer

12:35.667 --> 12:37.234
of bad news Miss Gernsback,

12:37.278 --> 12:38.670
but Jamie and Hugo have

12:38.714 --> 12:40.760
tragically been turned into
stuffed animals today.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.458
-Funny Ronnie, real funny.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.807
I don't see you volunteering.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.766
-That's 'cause I'm not stupid.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.072
I'm not stepping into
the zone of fear.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.161
-The what?

12:51.205 --> 12:54.686
[creepy music]

13:21.148 --> 13:22.627
-The zone of fear,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.716
look at your feet.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.935
Legend has it this place

13:25.979 --> 13:27.676
is protected by magic.

13:27.719 --> 13:28.938
Old man Kluger didn't want

13:28.982 --> 13:31.811
anyone ever coming here again.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.988
So he buried cat hair and
chicken bones everywhere.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.554
Once a few days passed

13:36.598 --> 13:37.860
an invisible force was created,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
one that would keep trespassing

13:39.906 --> 13:42.299
kids from ever escaping.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.692
-For how long?

13:43.735 --> 13:45.128
-For ever!

13:45.172 --> 13:46.303
-Shut up Ronnie.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.391
-I'm just telling you what my

13:47.435 --> 13:48.523
brothers told me,

13:48.566 --> 13:49.959
and their friends parent's
told them.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.134
-So, how are we supposed

13:51.178 --> 13:52.744
to get from here to the door?

13:52.788 --> 13:54.616
-I have an idea.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.054
-Good thing you brought that

13:58.098 --> 14:00.970
extra t-shirt in your backpack.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.189
-Come on, let's go quickly

14:02.232 --> 14:04.321
just incase the t-shirts
disintegrate.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.757
Somebody count.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.238
-Three, two, one, go!

14:08.282 --> 14:10.240
[together]
-Go, go, keep going.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.940
[cheering]

14:16.464 --> 14:18.161
-Okay, Hugo, anything happens,

14:18.205 --> 14:19.684
I buried $10 in the backyard,

14:19.728 --> 14:20.555
you can have it.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.599
-I found it already.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.905
-What? When?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
-I saw you digging from
the upstairs window.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
-Hugo, you're somethin' else.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.085
-Well, you guys going in or not?

14:29.129 --> 14:30.521
-We're going, we're going.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.262
-Yeah, we're going.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.395
-Hey, the front door's locked.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.918
-How'd you know the front door
was locked?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.180
-Huh?

14:37.224 --> 14:38.268
-You just said the front door
was locked.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.314
-No I didn't.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.056
-Try the side door.

14:43.099 --> 14:43.926
-Huh?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.710
-Stop doing that!

14:45.754 --> 14:47.930
-I didn't even say anything.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.759
-Okay then, let's try
the side door.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.806
-Heck, it could be dark
by the time they get in there.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.896
-I don't see you rushing
to help them Isaac.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
-That's because I got brains.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.904
[knocking]

15:04.947 --> 15:07.515
-I don't think anybody's home.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.913
[suspenseful music]

15:16.872 --> 15:18.613
-You ready to go in?

15:18.656 --> 15:20.745
But, you said you wanted to
see a haunted house.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.922
-That was over there, not here.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.315
-Okay, well, I'm going in.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.404
-Okay. Okay.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.971
-Just be ready to run.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.930
-I will.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.440
-Think it's up there?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.007
-No, I don't think so.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.009
Let's keep going this way.

16:14.495 --> 16:18.020
[animals roaring]
[Hugo yells]

16:18.064 --> 16:19.891
-Did you hear that?

16:19.935 --> 16:23.025
-Hear what?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.854
-Never mind.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.030
-It's just a stuffed animal.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.206
Come on!

16:33.862 --> 16:36.125
-Hey Jamie, look at this,
eyeballs,

16:36.169 --> 16:37.387
do you think they're real?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.041
-No, but leave them
where they are.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.477
-Why?

16:40.521 --> 16:41.739
Because someone might
come back looking for them.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.132
-How are they going to see them?

16:43.176 --> 16:45.787
[Jamie]
-Just come on.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.399
-I got to go soon,
I'm going to get grounded.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.400
-Me too.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.011
-Nobody's going anywhere.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.751
-Maybe you should go
and check on them Ronnie.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.492
-Yeah, they might be in trouble.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.886
-I'm sure they'll be out any
minute now.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.239
-Whoa!

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
-Double whoa!

17:05.111 --> 17:07.852
[dog barking]

17:07.896 --> 17:09.245
-Make that a triple.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.594
Bro, don't get too close,

17:10.638 --> 17:11.943
he might have rabies.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.075
-He doesn't have rabies,

17:13.119 --> 17:14.511
he just wants to play.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.339
-Oh, come on kid, I'm a good
guy,

17:16.383 --> 17:17.427
you can trust me!

17:17.471 --> 17:18.907
-What's your name?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.040
-Well, they call me Specimen
700,

17:21.083 --> 17:22.693
but you can call me Murphy.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.087
-Murphy?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.176
-Hey, he likes that name.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.961
[dog whining]

17:30.005 --> 17:32.094
-Do you think mom and dad
will let us keep him.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.444
-No, you know how much
dog food costs.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.880
-How much?

17:35.924 --> 17:36.707
-A lot!

17:36.751 --> 17:38.448
And dad just lost his job!

17:38.492 --> 17:40.102
-Do you mean, got fired?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.886
-He didn't get fired.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.411
-Yes he did, I heard mom and dad
talking.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.108
-Anyways, he's not our dog,

17:46.152 --> 17:47.631
someone probably lost him.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.286
[dog barking]

17:50.330 --> 17:52.114
[dog growling]

17:52.158 --> 17:53.768
-Well, we can't leave him here.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.726
Come on Jamie,
do the right thing.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.728
-Okay, fine, he can stay
at our house.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.774
But until we find it's owner,
okay?

17:59.817 --> 18:00.731
-Okay.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.647
[dog barking]

[phone rining]

18:18.619 --> 18:19.576
-Sheppard.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.751
-Ron, this is Cutler.

18:20.795 --> 18:21.622
-Yes sir.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.102
-What's the latest.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.668
-I've got National Guard troops
searching on the ground

18:24.712 --> 18:27.584
in nine in surrounding counties,
local police as well,

18:27.628 --> 18:29.412
not to mention the
secret service agents

18:29.456 --> 18:30.979
hitting up all the
animal shelters.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.807
-And they're unaware
of the animal's potential right?

18:32.850 --> 18:35.157
-Except for my men
everyone thinks they're looking

18:35.201 --> 18:36.419
for a little lost dog.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.029
-Can't believe you let him
get away.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.119
-It was an accident sir,
the train lurched,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.512
the pup's cage hit the floor
and snapped open.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.123
-And you and your team
couldn't catch him?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.472
I mean he's not that big.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
-He was liked greased lightning.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.867
Poor little guy saw an
opportunity and he took it.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.130
-Yeah, well that poor little guy

18:51.173 --> 18:52.783
is now our number one priority,

18:52.827 --> 18:54.350
we need him back soon

18:54.394 --> 18:55.873
lest he fall into
the wrong hands,

18:55.917 --> 18:57.658
possibly even enemy hands.

18:57.701 --> 18:58.615
-Yes sir.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.790
-What about that tracking chip

18:59.834 --> 19:00.835
that we put in his collar,

19:00.878 --> 19:01.836
can't we get him with that.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.185
No dice, the iron ore in the

19:03.229 --> 19:04.447
surrounding mountains has

19:04.491 --> 19:05.970
scrambled our signal,
we can't get a fix.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.363
-Well, somebody better fix
something soon

19:07.407 --> 19:08.625
or there's going to be
a major shakeup

19:08.669 --> 19:10.192
and you're going to be
at the top of it.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.193
Do you understand me?

19:11.237 --> 19:12.542
-Clearly.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.327
-I'll expect you to call in
before nightfall,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.067
and you'd better have
some good news for me.

19:16.111 --> 19:16.981
-Will do!

19:17.025 --> 19:18.200
-Ron, find the dog,

19:18.244 --> 19:19.680
it's not that hard.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.247
-Yes sir.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.686
Easy for you to say!

19:34.695 --> 19:36.305
-[Janelle]
He sure is cute.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.915
-He probably belongs to someone.

19:37.959 --> 19:38.960
-He's got tags,

19:39.003 --> 19:40.222
maybe they'll say where
he's from.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.573
-Slow down, he's really
sensitive to those.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.097
I tried looking at them myself,

19:46.141 --> 19:47.490
and he did the same thing to me.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.752
More than likely he doesn't

19:48.796 --> 19:50.232
want us to know where he's from.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.234
-Yeah, cause he doesn't want
to go back.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.844
-Maybe they hurt him there.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.542
They won't harm him anymore

19:55.585 --> 19:56.760
because we're keeping him.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.588
-What? No.

19:58.632 --> 19:59.589
We have to get permission

19:59.633 --> 20:01.330
from mom and dad first.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.636
-But--

20:02.679 --> 20:04.942
-No buts, we'll ask 'em tonight
after dinner.

20:04.986 --> 20:08.119
All right, but what if
they say, "No."?

20:08.163 --> 20:09.904
Maybe one of the gang
could take him.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.602
-Not me, my mom's allergic
to dog hair.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.866
-Do not look at me.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.694
My mom just redecorated
the house,

20:17.738 --> 20:20.393
and she don't want no puppy
messin' it up

20:20.436 --> 20:22.090
with the dirt from outside.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.352
-What about you Janelle?

20:23.396 --> 20:25.267
-I could ask but our apartment

20:25.311 --> 20:27.269
barely has room for mom
and myself.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.879
-See, Jamie, we're the ones.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.359
The dog picked us.

20:30.403 --> 20:31.969
You saw it.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.711
-Okay, but before mom and dad
say, "Yes."

20:34.755 --> 20:36.104
where are we going to put him?

20:36.147 --> 20:39.150
Up there maybe.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.457
Oh, in the clubhouse,
great idea little bro.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.067
Let's take him up.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.460
-Well, I got to go.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.114
-Yeah, my parents get all weird
and stuff

20:46.157 --> 20:47.811
if I don't come home
before dark.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.378
-Mine too.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.206
-Walk you home Janelle?

20:54.818 --> 20:57.081
-Okay Ronnie, thanks.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.302
Bye Jamie, bye-bye Murphy.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.957
[Murphy barks]

21:12.880 --> 21:16.710
[barking]

21:23.151 --> 21:25.284
-Honey, are you hearing that?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.589
-Hear what?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.287
-It sounds like a dog's barking
in the backyard.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.332
-It's probably the neighbor's
Saint Bernhard,

21:30.376 --> 21:31.551
he's always yelping when

21:31.594 --> 21:33.161
the kids come home through
their shortcut.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.293
[exasperatedly]
-Shortcut!

21:34.336 --> 21:35.816
You know I could use a shortcut
myself.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.695
-How's it coming?

21:45.739 --> 21:46.870
-It's not good.

21:46.914 --> 21:47.915
Doesn't look like there's going

21:47.958 --> 21:49.482
to be much for Christmas
this year.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.874
After paying all the bills
there's

21:50.918 --> 21:54.356
barely anything left over to
play Santa.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.229
-Bob, we'll do fine.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.536
The kids understand
you were laid off.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.451
-Laid off?

22:02.495 --> 22:04.671
It's more like I was
unceremoniously fired.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.020
After creating more than half

22:06.063 --> 22:07.369
of Galaxy's most profitable toys

22:07.413 --> 22:08.979
you know, the least they
could've done is

22:09.023 --> 22:10.633
they could've given me
some of those toys so I could

22:10.677 --> 22:13.244
give them to the boys for
Christmas.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.508
-You and I will get through
this.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.379
You are a wonderful designer.

22:17.423 --> 22:20.991
You create fantastic toys that
kids really love.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.166
Someone will surely come along

22:22.210 --> 22:24.691
who recognizes your amazing
abilities.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.739
-Yeah, well, until that happens

22:29.783 --> 22:33.917
we're going to have tighten
up our belt a little bit.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.093
What's for dinner?

22:36.137 --> 22:38.269
Your favorite, lamb stew,

22:38.313 --> 22:40.620
which I need to get back to
by the way.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.769
-All right Murph, make yourself
comfortable.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.771
I sleep here in the summer
myself.

23:01.815 --> 23:05.558
And here's water just incase
you get thirsty.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.603
I'm sorry we don't have any
dog food,

23:07.647 --> 23:09.213
so me and Hugo have to do

23:09.257 --> 23:11.128
a little improvising during
dinner time.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.521
-But don't worry,

23:12.565 --> 23:14.958
we'll be back later with some
really good food.

23:15.002 --> 23:18.179
mom makes a really good
mashed potatoes.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.400
-Jamie, Hugo, that's it
for today,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.053
drop what you're doing
and come to dinner.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.620
-Okay, we're coming mom.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.927
-Now boys, no dawdling,
your food will get cold.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.581
-Coming!

23:28.624 --> 23:30.234
-Are we going to ask them about
keeping him?

23:30.278 --> 23:31.497
-Yes, we will,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.063
we just need to wait for the
right moment.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.804
-When's that?

23:34.848 --> 23:35.892
-I don't know yet.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.591
But until then, keep it zipped,

23:38.634 --> 23:40.419
-Okay?
-Okay.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.421
Bye Murphy, see ya later.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.813
-Well, if it's all the same
to you Jamie

23:43.857 --> 23:44.901
I'd rather have the meat

23:44.945 --> 23:47.382
instead of the potatoes.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.256
-Did you say something Hugo?

23:52.300 --> 23:54.345
-No, you told me to keep
it quite.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.870
-I did, didn't I?

24:01.135 --> 24:04.486
-Human kids, I don't get it.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.488
[dogs barking]

24:06.532 --> 24:08.359
-I got to say, going to
all these animal shelters

24:08.403 --> 24:09.839
is kind of making me want to get
a dog.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.320
-Ha, I'm more of a cat guy
myself, less maintenance.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.191
-Are you kidding,
dogs are way better than cats.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.629
-Focus gentleman,
The clock is ticking,

24:16.672 --> 24:18.108
we need to find the specimen.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.284
-Don't worry sir, we're going to
track the fella' down.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.851
-Yeah, two or three days and
we--

24:21.895 --> 24:23.766
We may not get two or three days
agent.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.639
-I want both of you to--
[phone ringing]

24:26.682 --> 24:28.162
Quite!

24:28.205 --> 24:29.293
-Sheppard!

24:29.337 --> 24:30.469
-Sir, I was just about to
call you.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.774
-I'm sure you were.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.210
-We're getting close to
retrieving the dog sir.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.125
-And what does that mean
exactly?

24:35.169 --> 24:37.476
-Well, we've canvassed
the animal shelters nearby,

24:37.519 --> 24:39.695
we've combed through
the existing countryside.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.524
-Fa la la la, la, la, la.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.221
That's what I heard,
gibberish.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.006
You had one simple task,

24:46.049 --> 24:48.138
find the animal!

24:48.182 --> 24:49.183
-Yes sir.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.011
In my mind you already failed.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.708
We can't and won't take
any more chances.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.232
I cannot risk that animal
falling into the wrong hands.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.496
-So?
-So I've called in Agent Sharp.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.801
-Sharp sir?

24:58.845 --> 25:00.542
Don't you think that's a little
bit of overkill?

25:00.586 --> 25:02.022
-Exactly!

25:02.065 --> 25:03.502
There's a chopper heading
to your location at dawn.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.547
Give Sharp what little bit
of information you have.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.114
-Understood?
-Yes sir!

25:17.124 --> 25:19.822
-I heard on the news there might
be snow this weekend.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.258
-Nice to hear that every year.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.434
-They're predicting three to six
inches.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.001
Hugo, go easy on the mash.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.089
-I'm hungry.

25:26.133 --> 25:30.093
-Let him has as much as he
wants.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.182
-Since when did you like
Brussel Sprouts?

25:32.226 --> 25:35.708
Last time we had them you
didn't even eat one.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.362
-I must be growing up
I'm starting to like them.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.755
-Really?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.148
-Yup.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.193
-Hugo, I've been growing up
for nearly 40 years,

25:43.237 --> 25:44.673
I still don't like them.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.283
-Bob, I thought you loved my
sprouts.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.850
-Baby, you I love,

25:47.894 --> 25:51.201
your sprouts... [laughs]

25:51.245 --> 25:53.029
-Dad, can I ask you a question?

25:53.073 --> 25:54.117
-Sure buddy.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.206
-Well, what do you think, I
mean,

25:56.250 --> 25:57.860
would you be okay with--

25:57.904 --> 26:00.210
-Shoot! Napkin! Napkin!

26:00.254 --> 26:02.735
Shoot! Napkin!

26:02.778 --> 26:04.780
This is the second time today!

26:04.824 --> 26:06.129
What was your question?

26:06.173 --> 26:07.478
-Oh, I forget.

26:07.522 --> 26:08.784
-It's all that coffee you've
been drinking Bob,

26:08.828 --> 26:10.090
gives you the shakes.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.570
-Tell me about it.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.788
I've got nothing to do
around here but be caffeinated.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.094
-Maybe you need something

26:14.137 --> 26:16.313
else around here to take your
mind of things,

26:16.357 --> 26:20.579
like a hobby, or a pet.

26:20.622 --> 26:21.318
-A pet?

26:21.362 --> 26:22.755
Mom says idle hands

26:22.798 --> 26:24.583
are the Devil's playground.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.975
-Wow, you actually remembered

26:26.019 --> 26:27.586
something I said for once.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.284
-What I need is a job,
a good paying job.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.764
-Robert.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.896
-Look guys, you should know

26:33.940 --> 26:36.116
that we got a lot of bills
coming in right now

26:36.159 --> 26:37.291
and we're going to have to be

26:37.334 --> 26:38.901
smart about how we allocate
our funds.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.511
-Allocate funds?

26:40.555 --> 26:42.513
-Yeah buddy, our money,

26:42.557 --> 26:45.429
we're going to have to count our
pennies.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.649
-You can have what's in my
piggy bank if you need it.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.651
-Mine too!

26:49.695 --> 26:51.784
-Guys, I love you for
saying that, I really do,

26:51.827 --> 26:53.176
but that's not going to be
necessary okay,

26:53.220 --> 26:55.918
because we'll be fine until--

26:55.962 --> 26:57.528
-Till when?

26:57.572 --> 26:58.878
-What your father's trying to
say is,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.532
-Christmas might be
a little tight this year?

27:01.576 --> 27:02.664
-Tight?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.100
-Yeah, a little tight.

27:04.144 --> 27:08.844
-You mean no presents?

27:08.888 --> 27:11.368
-We don't know.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.196
What about a dog?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.676
-A dog!
-A dog!

27:14.720 --> 27:16.460
-He's just kidding.

27:16.504 --> 27:17.853
-No, I'm not!

27:17.897 --> 27:19.550
-The last thing we need right
now
is a dog!

27:19.594 --> 27:22.597
We can barely afford to feed
ourselves.

27:26.427 --> 27:29.299
-Hey, Hugo, you okay?

27:29.343 --> 27:31.911
-May we be excused?

27:33.739 --> 27:36.785
-All right boys.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.225
-I don't know what I'm going
to do.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.793
Twenty years with the toy
company
and now I can't even

27:44.837 --> 27:47.230
give my kids a decent Christmas.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.972
-Babe, you've done plenty
for them already this year.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.496
You built that treehouse
and the wishing well.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.584
-So?

27:53.628 --> 27:56.500
-So don't be so hard on
yourself,

27:56.544 --> 27:59.765
something good is coming,
I can feel it.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.992
[Langley]
-So what's the good word,
have you found him yet?

28:10.036 --> 28:11.254
-Still lookin'.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.429
-Sounds a little halfhearted.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.344
-No, no, I'm just tired and--

28:14.388 --> 28:15.781
-And what?

28:15.824 --> 28:17.260
-Well, we just came from one
of those local shelters,

28:17.304 --> 28:19.741
the sight of all those
poor animals locked up.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.048
You've got to have a heart
of stone not to be affected.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.615
I just keep thinking,
if we get our dog back

28:24.659 --> 28:26.617
he's going to be trapped
in one of those small cages

28:26.661 --> 28:27.923
for the rest of his life.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.838
-I see your point,
but that little guys has

28:29.882 --> 28:32.841
tremendous potential,
he'd be the perfect spy.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.756
-Pardon me for saying so Doc,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.758
but innocent little animals
should'n't be turned into

28:36.802 --> 28:38.629
subversive government agents.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.283
That's my job!

28:40.327 --> 28:42.372
-I get it.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.548
-I'll keep you posted
on the progress.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.899
-Thanks.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.744
-Here you are Murph,

29:05.787 --> 29:07.746
this ought to last you till
tomorrow.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.574
Come on boy, eat.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.273
-What's the matter, he's not
going for it.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.797
-Maybe he's just thinking
how good it smells.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.407
We snuck this out just for you.

29:17.451 --> 29:18.931
Come on boy.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.497
-Okay, here it goes.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.151
-Look, he's eating it.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.326
I guess so.

29:23.370 --> 29:24.675
-This isn't bad kid

29:24.719 --> 29:26.242
but what's with the
Brussel Sprouts?

29:26.286 --> 29:28.418
-Wait, wait, Hugo,

29:28.462 --> 29:29.768
did you hear that?

29:29.811 --> 29:30.943
-What?

29:30.986 --> 29:32.466
-Okay, you're going to think
I'm crazy,

29:32.509 --> 29:34.990
but I think the dog just talked
to me

29:35.034 --> 29:36.949
and he said he didn't want
the Brussel Sprouts.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.254
-Well, who does?

29:38.298 --> 29:39.821
-That's not what I'm trying
to say,

29:39.865 --> 29:42.084
he actually spoke to me.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.477
-I didn't hear anything.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.695
-But I did,

29:44.739 --> 29:46.785
heard it plain as day.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.699
-How come I didn't
hear it then?

29:48.743 --> 29:49.918
-I'm not sure,

29:49.962 --> 29:51.267
but I'm not kidding little bro,

29:51.311 --> 29:52.616
he talked to me.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.967
-I don't know about this Jamie.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.621
-Not everybody gets my thoughts all the time kid,

29:57.665 --> 30:00.015
just certain people, like you.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.712
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, there it is
again!

30:01.756 --> 30:03.714
He said only certain people
can hear him.

30:03.758 --> 30:06.935
-Jamie, you know what mom says
about teasing me,

30:06.979 --> 30:09.198
it's not brother-like.

30:09.242 --> 30:12.462
-I'm not teasing you Hugo,
I'm serious.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.203
-Well, ask him if we can keep
him, okay?

30:14.247 --> 30:16.118
-Tell your brother
I'd like to stick around

30:16.162 --> 30:18.033
but it's not that simple.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.121
-How so?

30:19.165 --> 30:20.209
-How so what?

30:20.253 --> 30:22.733
-Shhh, he's talking.

30:22.777 --> 30:23.822
-Again?

30:23.865 --> 30:25.301
-Will you just be quite?

30:25.345 --> 30:27.129
-What were you saying again?

30:27.173 --> 30:28.957
-You better have a look
at my collar.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.611
-You won't bite?

30:30.654 --> 30:33.179
-Nah, I'd never bite you
or anyone for that matter.

30:33.222 --> 30:35.311
-Hugo, he said he'd like
to stay with us,

30:35.355 --> 30:36.835
but there might be a problem.

30:36.878 --> 30:37.748
-What?

30:37.792 --> 30:39.359
-He said to look at his collar.

30:39.402 --> 30:42.362
-Careful Jamie, he doesn't seem
to like that.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.843
-He said it was okay.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.368
-What's it say?

30:48.411 --> 30:49.891
It's mostly a bunch of numbers,

30:49.935 --> 30:54.722
but it says right here
property of CIA

30:54.765 --> 30:56.332
-Wow, the feds!

30:56.376 --> 30:58.334
-The feds, where did you hear of
that?

30:58.378 --> 30:59.466
-On the TV.

30:59.509 --> 31:02.164
He must be some special
government dog.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.166
-That's one way to put it.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.951
-What do you mean?

31:05.994 --> 31:07.517
-Well, when they found out
what I could do they put me

31:07.561 --> 31:09.780
in a cage and sent me away
for experiments.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.695
-Gee, that's terrible.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.262
-What's terrible?

31:13.306 --> 31:15.743
-The government locked him up
and sent him away forever.

31:15.786 --> 31:18.615
-That's wrong, way wrong!

31:18.659 --> 31:20.574
-You know, you got a nice
little brother there Jamie,

31:20.617 --> 31:23.359
tell him I like him, a lot.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.797
-Hugo, Murphy says he likes you
a lot.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.277
-Well, I love him.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.019
That settles it, he stays
with us.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.065
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
not so fast there kiddo.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.024
The army wants me back
and there could be danger.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.592
-He says the soldiers are going
to come looking for him.

31:38.635 --> 31:41.203
-No, he belongs to us!

31:41.247 --> 31:45.338
-We'll see Hugo, come on,
we got to get to bed.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.909
He'll be alright out here

31:50.952 --> 31:52.562
at least until morning.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.129
[bark]
-Good night murphy.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.609
-Yeah, sleep well Murph,

31:55.652 --> 31:57.089
we'll find some answers out
in the morning.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.918
I won't let them get you,
I promise.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.137
Come on little brother,
let's go.

32:02.181 --> 32:06.272
-What? These Brussel Sprouts
are giving me gas!

32:11.146 --> 32:12.974
-I hope he's going to be
all right!

32:13.018 --> 32:15.890
-He will, he will,
come on, let's go.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.293
-Sir, there's a helicopter.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.381
-I see it.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.251
-They want to know where to
land,

32:29.295 --> 32:30.426
I told them quadrant seven.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.385
-Probably Sharp.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.529
-So I sense that you're not

32:46.573 --> 32:48.183
overjoyed with the
new arrival sir?

32:48.227 --> 32:50.098
-No, agent Manners, I am not.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.360
-May I ask why?

32:51.404 --> 32:52.622
-Because if Agent Sharp

32:52.666 --> 32:54.494
finds that little animal before
we do,

32:54.537 --> 32:56.800
chances are that dog won't
stand a chance.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.193
-Sir?

32:58.237 --> 33:00.369
-Agent Sharp is trained
to do one thing gentleman,

33:00.413 --> 33:02.981
get the job done by any means
possible.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.331
Despite that little mutt
putting us through the paces

33:05.374 --> 33:06.985
I hate to see anything happen
to him.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.464
He's innocent,
do you understand?

33:08.508 --> 33:09.639
-Sir you--
-Let me tell you something

33:09.683 --> 33:11.250
about Agent Sharp.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.295
I've been on three ops with
Sharp since I joined the bureau,

33:13.339 --> 33:15.297
and each time things got bad,

33:15.341 --> 33:17.038
and then they went from bad
to worse,

33:17.082 --> 33:19.867
and ultimately it didn't
have to.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.564
-Gee, he sounds like
a real pain.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.915
-Not he Mike, she.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.659
-I've landed.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.661
-Proceed.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.447
-With pleasure.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.756
-I don't believe it.

33:39.800 --> 33:40.844
-No way!

33:40.888 --> 33:42.107
-That's cray cray.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.673
-Are you sure that's what he
told you Hugo?

33:43.717 --> 33:44.935
-Yeah, that's what he said,

33:44.979 --> 33:46.328
the dog talked to him.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.069
I kind of don't believe it
myself,

33:48.113 --> 33:51.333
but he's my big brother
so I've gotta.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.422
-It's true I tell you,
it's all true.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.772
-You mean he actually speaks
to you?

33:55.816 --> 33:57.600
-Well, he doesn't exactly talk,

33:57.644 --> 33:59.341
but you can hear what he's
thinking.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.430
-Yeah? Prove it!

34:01.474 --> 34:03.084
-Okay, look at his collar.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.694
-Jamie, watch out,

34:04.738 --> 34:06.044
remember what
happened yesterday?

34:06.087 --> 34:07.523
He doesn't like when you do
that.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.264
-Janelle, it's fine, he told me

34:09.308 --> 34:10.613
to take a look yesterday.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.702
See, here, look.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.704
-It's just a bunch of numbers.

34:14.748 --> 34:18.230
-But look right here,
it says CIA.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.101
You know what that is
right Ronnie?

34:20.145 --> 34:21.537
-It's the feds Ronnie,

34:21.581 --> 34:23.104
Murphy belonged to
the government,

34:23.148 --> 34:26.194
but he ran away and now
he's ours.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.805
-Wait, wait, wait, just because

34:28.849 --> 34:30.111
he belongs to the government

34:30.155 --> 34:32.940
doesn't make him a talking dog.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.550
-I'm not a talking dog,

34:34.594 --> 34:35.986
I'm a thinking dog.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.119
Uh, anyone?

34:38.163 --> 34:39.903
You, over there,
kid in the corner.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.122
No?

34:41.166 --> 34:43.211
Um, okay.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.647
-Did you guys just hear that?

34:44.691 --> 34:45.735
-Whoa.

34:45.779 --> 34:46.997
-I'm not sure.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.826
-No, it, it's got to be a gag.

34:49.870 --> 34:53.787
Jamie, you've been practicing
ventriloquism or something.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.441
-Yeah, it wasn't Jamie okay?

34:55.484 --> 34:57.921
It's just me, your friendly
neighborhood watchdog.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.620
-Murphy, everybody can hear you.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.969
-Too weird.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.492
-You better believe it!

35:03.536 --> 35:05.494
-Murphy, why didn't you do this

35:05.538 --> 35:07.148
yesterday when I found you?

35:07.192 --> 35:08.758
-Come on kid, I'm a dog
on the run,

35:08.802 --> 35:11.021
I'm a fugitive and I don't know who to trust.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.849
-Not even me?

35:12.893 --> 35:14.242
-Hugo, kid, you know,

35:14.286 --> 35:15.548
I thought if you heard me

35:15.591 --> 35:16.505
it might scare you just
a wee bit.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.333
-I'm not scared of anything.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.595
-Buddy, that's going

35:19.639 --> 35:20.814
to change when you meet the guys

35:20.857 --> 35:22.250
that want me back.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.034
-You mean the government?

35:24.078 --> 35:25.427
-You got it Ron.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.081
Can I call you Ron?

35:27.125 --> 35:27.951
Because if they get me
it's back to doggy prison

35:27.995 --> 35:29.257
for the rest of my life,

35:29.301 --> 35:30.476
I'll spend Christmas
behind bars.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.999
-We can't let that happen guys.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.044
-Not going to happen while
I'm around.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.611
-Well, how do we protect him?

35:35.655 --> 35:37.178
-Well, the first thing you
can do is get rid

35:37.222 --> 35:39.049
of this collar here.

35:39.093 --> 35:40.355
I think, I don't know there's
some sort of tracking chip.

35:40.399 --> 35:41.791
you know, so they can find me.

35:41.835 --> 35:45.143
-Easy peezy, like my dad
would say.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.971
Okay, look, it's the last day
before Christmas break,

35:48.015 --> 35:49.973
everybody will be watching

35:50.017 --> 35:51.714
the pageant in the auditorium,

35:51.758 --> 35:53.455
we can easily sneak Murphy into

35:53.499 --> 35:54.978
shop class and cut it off there.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.067
-Right, they have all the tools
we need.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.373
-Yeah, let's get goin'.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.896
The sooner we get there,
sooner we can get this

35:59.940 --> 36:01.376
stupid collar of him.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.899
-Let's rock.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.728
-Thanks guys, I'll never
forget ya for this.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.208
-Agent Sheppard.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.601
-Agent Sharp.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.733
-Thanks, I assume you've spoken
to General Cutler?

36:10.777 --> 36:12.387
-Uh, he told me you were coming,
yes.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.650
I told him I'd hand over
whatever we have already.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.912
-Which is zip, correct?

36:15.956 --> 36:17.697
-Well, we've chased down a lot
of leads,

36:17.740 --> 36:20.003
but yeah, you're right,
nothing's panned out so far.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.570
-Well, that's about to change.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.225
Here's paperwork authorizing
me to take over the manhunt.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.879
-Manhunt?

36:25.922 --> 36:27.837
No, it's not exactly a manhunt,

36:27.881 --> 36:29.230
we're looking for a little dog.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.667
-According to Washington it's a
manhunt.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.191
So where's basecamp?

36:33.234 --> 36:35.758
-Two-hundred yards due South,
I'll walk you there.

36:35.802 --> 36:36.977
-Excuse me, Miss, where do you

36:37.020 --> 36:38.370
want us to put this box that
you brought?

36:38.413 --> 36:40.415
-Just follow us back to the
command center.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.113
And it's Agent Sharp.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.074
-Let me guess, case full
of doggy treats?

36:47.117 --> 36:48.336
-Funny.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.511
-I take it you don't like my
sense of humor.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.731
-Worse than the coffee.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.563
[dramatic music]

36:59.173 --> 37:02.132
Gentleman, the LN2020,

37:02.176 --> 37:05.614
the latest instate of the art
drone technology.

37:05.658 --> 37:06.876
-LN?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.530
-It's short for Little Nelly.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.228
But don't let the bumpkin name
fool you,

37:10.271 --> 37:11.620
she's fully loaded with

37:11.664 --> 37:13.883
everything needed to retrieve
the animal.

37:13.927 --> 37:16.277
-Very imposing, so you're like

37:16.321 --> 37:19.585
the ultimate sci-fi dog catcher?

37:25.025 --> 37:27.636
-So Murphy, how old
are you anyway?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.377
-Yeah.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.249
-Uh, dog's don't really
keep track of their birthdays.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.815
-Just like my mom.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.339
-Mine too.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.732
-And you've had this power
to talk to humans how long?

37:36.776 --> 37:38.647
-Since I was a pup,
but I never really thought

37:38.691 --> 37:41.084
of using until I saw
the soldiers, dun, dun, dun.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.303
-You were in the army?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.826
-Not exactly.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.306
You see, one night I ran into

37:45.350 --> 37:46.829
these military guys who were

37:46.873 --> 37:50.180
out doing what
they call maneuvers.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.273
I was out on my own runnin'
through the forest at night is

37:55.316 --> 37:56.970
fantastic at night.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.015
Squirrel, no that was cat, not a squirrel it's night time.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.279
Anyway, that's when I saw them
coming.

38:01.322 --> 38:02.323
And they had these lights,

38:02.367 --> 38:03.846
they were penetrating lights.

38:03.890 --> 38:07.502
I looked around, I didn't know
what to do.

38:07.546 --> 38:10.462
I saw this nearby bridge,
it was partially washed away,

38:10.505 --> 38:12.028
and I knew if I didn't
say something

38:12.072 --> 38:14.161
that a few might fall off and
get hurt.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.293
-What'd you do?

38:15.336 --> 38:16.816
-I tried barking, but they

38:16.859 --> 38:18.557
just thought I was some kind
of stray dog,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.123
you know, which I kind of was,
I can see their point.

38:20.167 --> 38:23.213
Well, so what I did, is I sent out a mental warning,

38:23.257 --> 38:24.693
you know, so they'd be careful
on the bridge.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.173
-What happened?

38:26.216 --> 38:28.480
-They all heard me,
that's weird right?

38:28.523 --> 38:30.525
It was weird for me too.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.310
But see, once they realized

38:32.353 --> 38:34.007
it had been me who warned them,

38:34.050 --> 38:37.053
well, they came over,
they scooped me up real quick

38:37.097 --> 38:39.142
and they took me right back
to their base.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.535
And when they figured out what
I could do

38:40.579 --> 38:42.363
they wouldn't let me go.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.451
-That's so mean!

38:43.495 --> 38:44.887
-Yeah, how'd you escape?

38:44.931 --> 38:46.324
-I jumped off a train.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.021
-My second cousin did that once

38:48.064 --> 38:49.631
when he didn't have a ticket.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.546
He lost his front tooth,
that's dangerous.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.114
-That it is Isaac, that it is.

38:56.116 --> 39:00.990
-Look here, two swiveling
4K cameras front and rear.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.253
Sophisticated Bat Radar
technology

39:03.297 --> 39:05.168
to avoid possible collisions.

39:05.212 --> 39:08.737
A range of 50 miles from
point of origin

39:08.781 --> 39:10.522
for maximum coverage.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.088
And I particularly like this,

39:12.132 --> 39:14.395
it's brand new.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.092
A taser stun feature which

39:16.136 --> 39:17.746
deploys an arc of power that

39:17.790 --> 39:20.401
can easily take down a target
from mid-air.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.577
-You do realize of course
that there's a lot of places

39:22.621 --> 39:24.666
a little dog can hide
in a 50 mile radius.

39:24.710 --> 39:25.928
-I'm aware of that.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.103
-And that iron ore in
these mountains

39:27.147 --> 39:28.583
has prevented us from accessing

39:28.627 --> 39:30.368
the tracking chip in
the dog's collar?

39:30.411 --> 39:33.109
-That won't be a problem for
Little Nelly.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.328
Her probe mechanism

39:34.372 --> 39:36.896
sends out 2000 micro-bursts
per second.

39:36.939 --> 39:40.290
Once her thrusters pick up even
the hint of signal

39:40.334 --> 39:43.032
she flies directly towards
the source.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.251
-And what happens when we

39:44.294 --> 39:45.774
find the dog and there's
civilians nearby?

39:45.818 --> 39:48.037
Do we fry them too?

39:48.081 --> 39:50.736
-I'll do my best to avoid it.

39:50.779 --> 39:53.869
-Yeah, I'm sure you will.

39:53.913 --> 39:57.090
Excuse me, I need
some fresh air.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.701
-Okay boys, take it outside,

39:59.745 --> 40:01.224
let's get her up and running.

40:01.268 --> 40:02.791
-Yes Agent Sharp.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.924
-Much better.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.809
[computer voice]
Target programmed.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.570
-Hey, I almost forgot!
-What?

40:42.614 --> 40:44.267
Hugo's supposed to be the

40:44.311 --> 40:46.661
main sugarplum in the
Nutcracker scene later on.

40:46.705 --> 40:49.359
-Awe, but I don't want to be
in a sugarplum.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.187
-But you have to,
if you don't show they'll

40:51.231 --> 40:53.146
probably come looking
for all of us.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.583
-Awe gee, they can go on
without me.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.498
Murphy's more important.

40:57.542 --> 40:58.978
-Better listen to your
brother Hugo,

40:59.021 --> 41:00.588
the show must go on,

41:00.632 --> 41:03.635
especially if it means I can
ditch this collar.

41:07.421 --> 41:11.730
Shhh everyone, quite,
do you hear that?

41:16.648 --> 41:20.521
[computer voice]
-Searching. GPS locked.

41:27.006 --> 41:27.876
-Hear what?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.225
-There's nothing.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.098
[computer voice]
-Searching.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.798
-Wait, I think I hear it too.

41:36.842 --> 41:41.673
It sounds like a high-pitched
whistle.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.326
-I think I hear it also.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.806
-Me too.

41:44.850 --> 41:48.070
-Yeah, it sounds like a small
helicopter or something.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.420
-Oh no.

41:52.205 --> 41:53.380
-Look!

41:53.423 --> 41:54.555
[computer voice]
-Target located.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.557
[beeping]

41:56.601 --> 41:57.819
-There's the dog.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.560
We've got him!

41:59.604 --> 42:01.649
-You've also got a bunch
of frightened 10-year-old kids.

42:01.693 --> 42:04.391
-They're young, they'll get
over it.

42:05.784 --> 42:07.046
-What is it?

42:07.089 --> 42:08.482
-Ah, I've seen these
before kids,

42:08.526 --> 42:11.093
it's a drone, it's like a clone of a helicopter.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.965
It's the government men,

42:13.008 --> 42:15.097
they found me, you guys got
to get away from me, go split!

42:15.141 --> 42:16.534
-I'm not leaving you Murphy.

42:16.577 --> 42:17.752
-Neither am I!

42:17.796 --> 42:19.449
-We're together, all of us.

42:19.493 --> 42:20.407
-Right.

42:20.450 --> 42:21.756
-Well, then head for the trees,

42:21.800 --> 42:23.192
it will be harder for them
to follow us there.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.498
Run!

42:36.510 --> 42:39.252
[computer voice]
-Target located.

42:58.097 --> 43:01.143
[laughter]

43:01.187 --> 43:03.972
-You must be a wiz at Xbox.

43:20.685 --> 43:23.818
-Time for the big guns!

43:32.044 --> 43:35.787
[computer voice]
-Economy power down to 75%.

43:38.398 --> 43:40.008
-Look at her enjoying this.

43:40.052 --> 43:42.620
-I know!

43:45.187 --> 43:47.320
-Sharp don't do it please,
you're going to hurt those kids.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.670
-I'm the one in charge here.
If you can't handle it Agent

43:49.714 --> 43:51.498
I suggest you go outside
and get some more air,

43:51.541 --> 43:54.283
and take your men with you.

43:54.327 --> 43:56.459
-Not the kids.

43:56.503 --> 43:58.810
-With pleasure.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.561
-Sheppard!

44:11.605 --> 44:13.563
Consider yourself on report.

44:13.607 --> 44:16.654
-Hey, accidents happen.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.307
-Well, we'll see about that.

44:18.351 --> 44:20.614
Plug that in!

44:23.704 --> 44:24.792
-Power restored ma'am.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.141
-Keep him out of there.

44:26.185 --> 44:28.187
-Yes ma'am.

44:29.884 --> 44:31.190
-That's the way it went down.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.539
-So you just kicked out
the power cord?

44:32.582 --> 44:35.324
-Yeah, caused quite a bit of
commotion too.

44:35.368 --> 44:37.675
Never thought it'd be so easy
to resign my commission.

44:37.718 --> 44:38.980
-They wouldn't.

44:39.024 --> 44:40.503
-Oh, they might.

44:40.547 --> 44:42.680
This Agent Sharp has quite
a rep in DC.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.116
-Sending a power drone

44:44.159 --> 44:45.726
against a bunch of innocent
10-year-olds, she must.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.075
-Yeah, well you can testify

44:47.119 --> 44:48.729
to that affect
at my court martial.

44:48.773 --> 44:50.731
-Gladly.

44:56.128 --> 44:57.738
-Hey, it's stopped.

44:57.782 --> 44:59.261
-Keep going, we can get away.

45:15.930 --> 45:18.585
-It's still coming, run,
keep running.

45:18.628 --> 45:21.066
-Go, go!

45:23.068 --> 45:25.418
[beeping]

45:26.680 --> 45:29.683
[computer voice]
-Communication interrupted.

45:31.337 --> 45:32.555
-Go!

45:32.599 --> 45:33.556
-Hey, it's gone.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.733
-We must have outrun it.

45:35.776 --> 45:37.909
-You can relax now Murphy.

45:37.952 --> 45:40.172
[panting]
-I'm, I'm not so sure.

45:40.999 --> 45:43.218
-No, there it is again,
run, run.

45:43.262 --> 45:44.437
-Go, go!

45:44.480 --> 45:46.744
-I'm out of here.

45:47.919 --> 45:49.747
-You got our baseball?
-In my pack.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.661
-Okay, then head for the lot,
I got an idea.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.925
Everyone follow me.

46:10.202 --> 46:12.857
-You know what I need Ronnie.

46:14.859 --> 46:17.513
-I most certainly do.

46:17.557 --> 46:20.168
-Then pitch it right down
the middle.

46:20.212 --> 46:22.257
-Okay, just don't miss.

46:22.301 --> 46:24.303
-I won't.

46:25.652 --> 46:27.436
-I hope he doesn't strike out.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.177
-He won't Murphy, I promise.

46:29.221 --> 46:30.700
-Come on Jamie, you can do it.

46:30.744 --> 46:32.615
-Go Jamie, go!

46:32.659 --> 46:35.749
-I have you now!

46:43.061 --> 46:44.845
[computer voice]
-Communication interrupted.

46:44.889 --> 46:46.020
-What?

46:46.064 --> 46:49.110
-Wow.

46:49.154 --> 46:51.199
-Yes, yes!

46:51.243 --> 46:53.854
[cheering]

46:56.509 --> 46:57.640
-You did it Jamie.

46:57.684 --> 46:58.554
-Great job.

46:58.598 --> 46:59.860
-I thought we were goners.

46:59.904 --> 47:00.948
-Nice pitch Ronnie.

47:00.992 --> 47:02.645
-I need to work on my curveball

47:02.689 --> 47:04.473
so you don't hit everything
I throw.

47:04.517 --> 47:06.345
-Uh, not to change
the subject,

47:06.388 --> 47:08.956
yeah, me, the collar,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.958
it's still around my neck.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.177
Hello!

47:12.220 --> 47:14.179
-He's right, whoever was flying
that drone

47:14.222 --> 47:15.658
isn't going to give up that easy

47:15.702 --> 47:17.182
and we can't go inside
the school

47:17.225 --> 47:18.748
'cause they already know
we're here.

47:18.792 --> 47:19.880
-What about Mr. Greed?

47:19.924 --> 47:21.360
He's got that tool shed,

47:21.403 --> 47:23.579
there's got to be some
bolt cutters in there.

47:23.623 --> 47:25.320
-What do you think Murph?

47:25.364 --> 47:27.235
-Sounds like a plan to me.

47:27.279 --> 47:29.672
[phone rining]

47:29.716 --> 47:31.152
-Yeah.

47:31.196 --> 47:32.414
-I got somethin'
to tell ya boss,

47:32.458 --> 47:34.721
and I think you're going
to like it.

47:34.764 --> 47:37.028
[muffled voice talking]

47:44.557 --> 47:45.863
-Well, that should do it.

47:45.906 --> 47:47.995
-Ah, that's what I'm
talking about.

47:48.039 --> 47:49.692
Oh, is that a real massage?

47:49.736 --> 47:50.606
I've read about these.

47:50.650 --> 47:51.912
I can only pay in dog biscuits.

47:51.956 --> 47:53.392
[laughter]

47:53.435 --> 47:55.611
-Well, what do we do now?

47:55.655 --> 47:57.178
-Everybody should go home.

47:57.222 --> 47:58.919
-I'm going to throw that collar
in the wishing well.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.268
-Great idea bro.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.443
-What about Murph?

48:01.487 --> 48:02.923
-He's staying with us.

48:02.967 --> 48:04.620
-You don't think they're
going to come looking for him?

48:04.664 --> 48:06.361
-They can't track him without
the collar.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.362
-You sure?

48:07.406 --> 48:09.451
-One-hundred percent!

48:11.801 --> 48:13.107
[phone ringing]

48:13.151 --> 48:15.196
-Yeah, hello,
Principal Callahan's office.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.937
-This is maintenance,
put him on!

48:16.981 --> 48:18.939
-I'm sorry, you'll have
to call back,

48:18.983 --> 48:20.027
He's on the other line

48:20.071 --> 48:21.811
and he's got two FBI
people waiting.

48:21.855 --> 48:22.812
-All right.

48:22.856 --> 48:24.379
-Yeah, well, you tell

48:24.423 --> 48:27.643
that little punk to get back to
class.

48:27.687 --> 48:29.776
How much longer is this
going to take?

48:29.819 --> 48:31.430
I have a school to run here.

48:31.473 --> 48:33.911
-As soon as we get the answers
we're looking for we'll be gone.

48:33.954 --> 48:36.304
-Well, I've already answered
all your questions.

48:36.348 --> 48:39.090
I've not seen any stray dog
around here.

48:39.133 --> 48:42.006
-Do you know any of these
children?

48:43.790 --> 48:47.228
-Well of course,
these are all students here.

48:47.272 --> 48:48.577
-What Agent Sharp means is,

48:48.621 --> 48:50.840
do you know where
we can find them?

48:50.884 --> 48:52.407
-I'll tell you where you
won't find this one,

48:52.451 --> 48:53.931
is on our stage.

48:53.974 --> 48:55.149
He was the main sugarplum

48:55.193 --> 48:56.672
in today's production
of the Nutcracker.

48:56.716 --> 48:59.719
Pulled a no-show,
ruined everything.

49:00.850 --> 49:02.417
You ever seen the Nutcracker?

49:02.461 --> 49:04.593
-No, I can't say that I have.

49:04.637 --> 49:08.249
-Well, you should,
It's a heck of a ballet.

49:08.293 --> 49:09.947
-I'm sure it is.

49:09.990 --> 49:11.992
-Be that as it may Mr. Callahan

49:12.036 --> 49:14.342
we are going to need a list
of addresses.

49:14.386 --> 49:16.431
-See the kid outside,
I've already told him to

49:16.475 --> 49:20.261
give you a printout of all
the local addresses.

49:20.305 --> 49:22.263
-Thank you.

49:22.307 --> 49:23.699
-You tell that little sugarplum

49:23.743 --> 49:26.485
he'll never work
in this school again.

49:29.401 --> 49:31.011
-I'll relay the message.

49:31.055 --> 49:33.666
-Yeah, make my day don't ya.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.190
-Come one, let's get
through this

49:36.234 --> 49:37.713
while there's still
some daylight.

49:37.757 --> 49:39.977
-Whatever you say.

49:42.849 --> 49:46.287
-Here's that list for you.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.681
-Sorry.

49:51.249 --> 49:52.902
-Are you out there kid?

49:52.946 --> 49:54.426
-Yes sir.

49:54.469 --> 49:57.342
-Call Frisco, get my brother
Harry on the line will ya?

49:57.385 --> 49:59.431
-Right away sir!

50:01.041 --> 50:03.565
-Guys, are you sure
I have to stay up here?

50:03.609 --> 50:05.132
I'm hungry!

50:05.176 --> 50:06.829
-Well, it's the safest place
until everything blows over.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.396
-I'm going to get you
some food.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.703
-Great, just no more
Brussel Sprouts, okay?

50:10.746 --> 50:11.747
Gas, remember?

50:11.791 --> 50:13.227
-Deal.
-Okay.

50:13.271 --> 50:16.404
-See ya Murph.
-So long Murph.

50:16.448 --> 50:19.233
-Okay, high-five, come on
I've been working on this.

50:19.277 --> 50:21.409
Hi, come on!

50:21.453 --> 50:23.933
-There you two are,
where have you guys been?

50:23.977 --> 50:26.023
-Playing baseball.

50:26.066 --> 50:28.721
-I figured, well go make sure
your rooms clean before dinner.

50:28.764 --> 50:30.853
-You got it mom, where's dad?

50:30.897 --> 50:33.595
-He had to go to Shelbyville
for a possible job opportunity.

50:33.639 --> 50:34.857
-I hope he gets it.

50:34.901 --> 50:36.424
-Me too.
-Me three.

50:36.468 --> 50:38.035
-And Hugo, I'm sorry mommy

50:38.078 --> 50:39.949
wasn't able to see you in your
pageant today,

50:39.993 --> 50:41.429
dad and I had to go into town

50:41.473 --> 50:43.083
to see about his work benefits.

50:43.127 --> 50:44.389
-It's okay mom.

50:44.432 --> 50:46.347
-Well, how was it, how'd you do?

50:46.391 --> 50:48.045
I bet you really surprised them.

50:48.088 --> 50:50.177
-I sure did!

50:50.221 --> 50:52.179
-All right, well you can tell us
all about it at dinner, okay?

50:52.223 --> 50:54.094
-Great. Can't wait.

50:54.138 --> 50:56.575
-Yeah, come on Hugo, let's go.

51:02.146 --> 51:05.018
-Mm, I got an idea.

51:41.141 --> 51:42.316
-This is it.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.666
-Yeah.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.494
-You couldn't have gotten
a better car?

51:46.538 --> 51:50.063
-This ain't DC,
be happy it runs.

52:07.994 --> 52:09.691
-Can I help you?

52:09.735 --> 52:11.040
-Mrs. Gernsback?

52:11.084 --> 52:12.346
-Yes.

52:12.390 --> 52:16.133
-I'm Agent Sharp,
this is Agent Sheppard, FBI.

52:16.176 --> 52:18.135
-What's this all about,

52:18.178 --> 52:20.049
have we done something wrong?

52:20.093 --> 52:21.790
Nothing's happened to my husband
has it?

52:21.834 --> 52:23.096
-No, not at all ma'am.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.445
-There's just been some
complaints in the area

52:24.489 --> 52:25.620
and we're taking all proper
precautions

52:25.664 --> 52:26.882
and going door-to-door.

52:26.926 --> 52:28.145
-Uh, what type of complaints.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.058
-A theft.

52:29.102 --> 52:30.625
-Specifically dog-napping.

52:30.669 --> 52:33.889
-Oh my goodness, well,
we'll keep an eye out.

52:33.933 --> 52:35.456
-We're looking for a dog
that might have been stolen

52:35.500 --> 52:36.805
in your neighborhood ma'am.

52:36.849 --> 52:38.372
-A dog?

52:38.416 --> 52:41.723
-Yeah, would it be, do you think
we could come in and just

52:41.767 --> 52:43.812
look around just for a minute?

52:43.856 --> 52:45.901
-I suppose that'd be all right.

52:45.945 --> 52:48.513
Sure, please come in.

52:50.689 --> 52:52.560
-Do you think dad will find
another job?

52:52.604 --> 52:55.041
-Sure, I hope so.

52:55.084 --> 52:56.564
[knocking on door]

52:56.608 --> 52:58.305
-Oh, come in.

52:58.349 --> 53:01.874
-Hey guys, we have
some visitors from the FBI

53:01.917 --> 53:04.529
that are taking a look around
the house for a minute.

53:04.572 --> 53:05.921
-Hello children.

53:05.965 --> 53:07.227
-Are you a real fed?

53:07.271 --> 53:09.534
-Precocious youngster
isn't he?

53:09.577 --> 53:10.665
-Very.

53:10.709 --> 53:12.058
-Yes son, we're from Washington.

53:12.101 --> 53:14.103
-We're looking for a dog
that was stolen recently.

53:14.147 --> 53:16.584
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that would you?

53:18.586 --> 53:20.762
-Oh, we don't have a dog
Agent Sharp.

53:20.806 --> 53:24.288
-I was asking the boys here
if you don't mind.

53:25.811 --> 53:27.247
-Somebody stole a dog?

53:27.291 --> 53:28.727
-Yeah, well one went missing,

53:28.770 --> 53:30.685
and we're just trying to help
locate it, that's all.

53:30.729 --> 53:33.340
You guys wouldn't know anything
about that would you?

53:33.384 --> 53:34.341
-No sir.

53:34.385 --> 53:35.864
Hugo, have you seen a dog?

53:35.908 --> 53:38.389
-Nope.
-And Neither have I.

53:42.306 --> 53:44.786
-Okay, well,
we'll be on our way.

53:44.830 --> 53:48.268
-Wait a minute, what about that
treehouse out there?

54:09.333 --> 54:10.812
-Ladies first?

54:10.856 --> 54:12.945
-Be my guest.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.826
-What are we going to do?

54:24.870 --> 54:27.438
-Don't worry, we'll get out of
this somehow.

54:34.358 --> 54:37.448
[suspenseful music]

54:56.205 --> 54:59.252
-So long boys.

55:02.821 --> 55:05.737
[whispers]
I know.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.661
-Where'd he go?

55:16.704 --> 55:20.012
-I don't know.

55:21.840 --> 55:23.232
-Is everything okay?

55:23.276 --> 55:25.800
-Fine. Thank you for your time
Mrs. Gernsback.

55:25.844 --> 55:27.324
We'll be going now.

55:27.367 --> 55:30.065
If you happen to hear or see
anything at all

55:30.109 --> 55:33.547
please don't hesitate
to give us a call.

55:33.591 --> 55:35.201
-We'll do.

55:35.244 --> 55:37.421
-Thank you, have a good day.

55:51.435 --> 55:53.175
-Okay, okay, let me see,
what's that?

55:53.219 --> 55:55.917
Oh, okay, first of all they
can't spell N.

55:55.961 --> 55:57.745
Um, what's that, oh, okay,

55:57.789 --> 56:00.095
wires, I got it.

56:00.139 --> 56:02.097
Cigar, I'll put this over here.

56:02.141 --> 56:03.708
Use another one of these guys.

56:03.751 --> 56:05.666
That's a lot of cigars.

56:05.710 --> 56:06.841
Somebody likes to smoke.

56:06.885 --> 56:08.408
You know smoking isn't healthy.

56:08.452 --> 56:10.410
I happen to know that even
though I'm a dog.

56:10.454 --> 56:12.978
And let's try...

56:14.806 --> 56:16.764
Oh, this thing over here the big thing with the wires on it.

56:16.808 --> 56:19.593
Come on.

56:19.637 --> 56:22.901
Let's go, let's go, come on,
come on.

56:22.944 --> 56:26.295
Ah, come on, a little MacGyver
action here,

56:26.339 --> 56:29.516
a little pinecone with
[mumbles].

56:29.560 --> 56:30.909
[panting]
Okay, that's good.

56:30.952 --> 56:34.782
Come on wire let's go, let's go.

56:34.826 --> 56:37.306
This is gonna be so cool.

56:37.350 --> 56:40.092
[laughs]

56:42.355 --> 56:44.531
They're not going to know
what happened.

56:44.575 --> 56:47.708
I've got no opposable thumbs,
not bad.

56:47.752 --> 56:50.711
Okay, hey, it's time,
it's time for a little nap.

56:50.755 --> 56:53.061
Blanket, nice.

56:53.105 --> 56:57.065
Okay, oh, I needed that,
that's a lot of work.

56:57.109 --> 56:58.806
See ya later.

56:58.850 --> 57:00.634
-This just doesn't feel right.

57:00.678 --> 57:02.593
Those kids were scamming us,
I just know it.

57:02.636 --> 57:05.465
-Come on, that little one was
not more than 7-years-old.

57:05.509 --> 57:07.075
-Yeah right, Mr. Fed.

57:07.119 --> 57:09.469
He's hiding a lot behind those
innocent little eyes of his.

57:09.513 --> 57:10.905
-You know what I think?

57:10.949 --> 57:12.167
-What's that Agent?

57:12.211 --> 57:13.342
-You need a vacation.

57:13.386 --> 57:15.301
-To me this is a vacation.

57:15.344 --> 57:16.955
-So what do you want to do,

57:16.998 --> 57:18.173
bring them down to headquarters
put them under the hot lights?

57:18.217 --> 57:19.305
-I've got a better idea.

57:19.348 --> 57:20.915
-What's that?

57:20.959 --> 57:23.265
-We're going to have ourselves
and old fashioned stakeout.

57:23.309 --> 57:24.571
-A stakeout?

57:24.615 --> 57:26.486
As in, you, me, in that car
all night long?

57:26.530 --> 57:28.488
Takeout food and bad coffee?

57:28.532 --> 57:30.011
-Exactly.

57:30.055 --> 57:32.013
-I was afraid you'd say that.

57:32.057 --> 57:35.626
-What are you in the mood for,
Mexican or Chinese?

57:56.908 --> 57:59.824
We've got action in the
driveway.

58:01.652 --> 58:03.654
Wait for it.

58:07.005 --> 58:09.573
Wait for it.

58:10.704 --> 58:12.401
-Wait, wait, wait what?

58:12.445 --> 58:15.274
Do you see something?

58:17.537 --> 58:21.498
-No, it's nothing,
The night is still young.

58:21.541 --> 58:24.196
Pass me some more of that
hot sauce would ya?

58:39.254 --> 58:42.040
[whispering]
-Hey buddy, what are you doing

58:42.083 --> 58:43.520
how come you're not in bed?

58:43.563 --> 58:45.086
-I couldn't sleep.

58:45.130 --> 58:48.089
Did you get the job.

58:48.133 --> 58:50.222
-Well, they didn't say no,

58:50.265 --> 58:52.833
so I guess I'm kinda still
in the running.

58:52.877 --> 58:54.574
-Cool.

58:54.618 --> 58:56.445
-Yeah.

58:56.489 --> 59:00.406
It's good to see you buddy,
even if it past your bedtime.

59:00.449 --> 59:01.668
-Dad?

59:01.712 --> 59:04.410
-Yeah.

59:04.453 --> 59:06.151
-Um...

59:07.456 --> 59:10.547
-[laughs] I know that look.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.549
That's the, "I need to tell you

59:12.592 --> 59:15.116
something and you might
get mad." look.

59:15.160 --> 59:19.599
Don't worry, just spill it,
I am way too tired.

59:19.643 --> 59:22.080
After today I can
handle anything.

59:22.646 --> 59:26.301
-Well, Hugo and I, well,

59:26.345 --> 59:29.696
we think we're in trouble
with the FBI.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.611
-[laughs] The FBI? For what?

59:31.655 --> 59:34.919
For not doing your homework?

59:36.442 --> 59:37.965
You're serious?

59:38.009 --> 59:41.142
What could you two possibly
have done that would warrant

59:41.186 --> 59:43.144
the FBI's attention?

59:43.188 --> 59:44.798
-Dog-napping.

59:44.842 --> 59:47.105
-You two, dog-napping?
[laughs] Dog-napping?

59:47.148 --> 59:50.978
-Dad, stop laughing,
I'm serious.

59:51.022 --> 59:52.893
-Okay, but you got to tell me

59:52.937 --> 59:56.244
why would the FBI suspect

59:56.288 --> 59:58.507
you two of dog-napping?

59:58.551 --> 1:00:00.814
-Because we kidnapped a dog.

1:00:00.858 --> 1:00:02.773
-Here in town?

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:05.166
-Yeah, out by the old Kluger
house.

1:00:05.210 --> 1:00:07.255
-Where's the dog now?

1:00:07.299 --> 1:00:08.779
-I'm not sure.

1:00:08.822 --> 1:00:11.520
-[laughs] So why would the FBI

1:00:11.564 --> 1:00:13.958
care about some old mutt
who followed you guys

1:00:14.001 --> 1:00:15.916
back from the ball field?

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:19.485
-Well, because it can talk.

1:00:19.528 --> 1:00:23.445
-Did you just say,
"Because it can talk."?

1:00:23.489 --> 1:00:25.447
Okay, I think it's time to get
back in bed

1:00:25.491 --> 1:00:26.927
because you're
obviously delirious.

1:00:26.971 --> 1:00:28.015
Are you coming down with
something buddy.

1:00:28.059 --> 1:00:29.930
-I'm not coming down
with anything.

1:00:29.974 --> 1:00:31.845
I'm telling the truth.

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:35.109
-About the talking dog, yeah?

1:00:35.153 --> 1:00:36.676
-Yes sir.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:39.287
Well, it can't exactly talk,

1:00:39.331 --> 1:00:41.115
but you can hear it
in your head.

1:00:41.159 --> 1:00:42.334
-Okay, well what is it?

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:44.205
I mean can it talk
or can it not talk?

1:00:44.249 --> 1:00:48.340
-It's complicated, but it's name
is Murphy.

1:00:49.820 --> 1:00:56.087
-Okay, okay, fine, I believe you
about the talking dog Jamie.

1:00:57.741 --> 1:00:59.177
-And about the FBI?

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:00.395
-Yes, yes, of course,

1:01:00.439 --> 1:01:03.181
about the FBI and the
talking dog.

1:01:04.617 --> 1:01:06.184
What next?

1:01:06.227 --> 1:01:08.534
-I don't know.

1:01:11.363 --> 1:01:13.408
-Oh buddy, come on,
don't worry about it,

1:01:13.452 --> 1:01:16.368
we will figure it out
in the morning though.

1:01:16.411 --> 1:01:17.891
Okay? In the morning.

1:01:17.935 --> 1:01:19.719
Let's go get some rest.

1:01:19.763 --> 1:01:21.373
-Okay.

1:01:23.549 --> 1:01:24.855
-Hey, buddy.

1:01:24.898 --> 1:01:26.421
Don't stress about it okay,

1:01:26.465 --> 1:01:27.858
we'll figure it out tomorrow.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.816
I love you. Good night.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:33.080
-Thanks dad.

1:01:36.649 --> 1:01:39.130
[dog whining]

1:01:46.050 --> 1:01:49.575
[snoring]

1:01:57.235 --> 1:02:02.893
[snoring]

1:02:15.601 --> 1:02:18.604
[brakes screeching]

1:02:20.127 --> 1:02:22.129
-What-- What is it?

1:02:22.173 --> 1:02:25.742
-Stand down, false alarm.

1:02:25.785 --> 1:02:28.135
It's nothing, except for your
incessant snoring.

1:02:28.179 --> 1:02:30.224
-I don't snore.

1:02:30.268 --> 1:02:33.967
-What time is it?

1:02:34.011 --> 1:02:37.884
-Twenty after seven.

1:02:37.928 --> 1:02:39.494
-Do we have any more coffee?

1:02:39.538 --> 1:02:41.235
-Coffee.

1:02:41.279 --> 1:02:43.716
[sighs]

1:02:51.637 --> 1:02:53.160
-See anything?

1:02:53.204 --> 1:02:54.596
-No, you?

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:55.815
-No.

1:02:55.859 --> 1:03:00.254
-All right boys, breakfast
is served.

1:03:00.298 --> 1:03:03.170
-Come on guys, let's eat.

1:03:06.826 --> 1:03:09.524
-So the FBI paid us
a visit yesterday.

1:03:09.568 --> 1:03:12.136
-I heard that.

1:03:14.051 --> 1:03:16.183
-Anything we should know mister?

1:03:16.227 --> 1:03:18.446
-I'm innocent, I swear.

1:03:18.490 --> 1:03:20.535
[laughingly]
-I'm sure you are kiddo.

1:03:20.579 --> 1:03:23.495
-Jamie?

1:03:25.540 --> 1:03:27.151
[barking]

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:30.067
-Murphy!
-Murphy!

1:03:31.677 --> 1:03:32.852
-Murphy?

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:35.550
-I have no idea.

1:03:35.594 --> 1:03:36.943
-Hey guys!

1:03:36.987 --> 1:03:38.466
-Murphy!
-Murphy!

1:03:38.510 --> 1:03:39.859
-Who let the dog in?

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:41.208
Ruff, ruff.

1:03:41.252 --> 1:03:42.340
Oh, that feels good,
that feels good.

1:03:42.383 --> 1:03:43.645
[panting]

1:03:43.689 --> 1:03:44.864
Do I smell--

1:03:44.908 --> 1:03:46.126
Is that bacon?

1:03:46.170 --> 1:03:48.955
Bacon! I smell the bacon!

1:03:48.999 --> 1:03:50.522
-Bacon.

1:03:50.565 --> 1:03:52.959
-See, now do you believe me?

1:03:53.003 --> 1:03:55.179
-Son, I mean I don't know
what to say okay?

1:03:55.222 --> 1:03:56.484
Look, a real live talking dog?

1:03:56.528 --> 1:03:58.138
I mean what's-- Wow.

1:03:58.182 --> 1:04:00.358
-You'll get over it okay?

1:04:00.401 --> 1:04:02.577
Now, how about that bacon?

1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:09.497
What is that maple,
hits the spot!

1:04:09.541 --> 1:04:10.934
You gonna eat that toast?

1:04:10.977 --> 1:04:12.196
Listen, now that breakfast
is finished

1:04:12.239 --> 1:04:14.241
we should get down to business.

1:04:14.285 --> 1:04:15.677
-And that is?

1:04:15.721 --> 1:04:17.592
-Well, for starters there's

1:04:17.636 --> 1:04:20.987
two FBI agents parked down the
street surveilling your house.

1:04:21.031 --> 1:04:22.510
-Oh dear.

1:04:22.554 --> 1:04:24.164
-Not to worry,
thankfully they're not doing

1:04:24.208 --> 1:04:25.774
a very good job of it.

1:04:25.818 --> 1:04:27.776
-Okay, are we in danger
in any way?

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:30.083
-Not if my plan works!

1:04:30.127 --> 1:04:32.912
-Great! And if your plan
doesn't work?

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:35.567
-Let's just try to focus
on the positive here, huh?

1:04:35.610 --> 1:04:37.177
Shall we do that?
Let's try and do that.

1:04:37.221 --> 1:04:39.179
I'm afraid I didn't catch
your name there sir.

1:04:39.223 --> 1:04:41.790
-Uh, Robert.

1:04:41.834 --> 1:04:43.227
-Ah, Robert!

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:44.532
Pleasure to meet you sir.

1:04:44.576 --> 1:04:46.621
You got two lovely kids
you know?

1:04:46.665 --> 1:04:49.711
-Yes, I'm keenly aware of that
Mr...

1:04:49.755 --> 1:04:53.019
-My name is Murphy,
but you can call me Murph.

1:04:53.063 --> 1:04:54.455
So, as I was saying,

1:04:54.499 --> 1:04:56.370
I have a plan but it requires

1:04:56.414 --> 1:04:58.459
coordinated timely action,

1:04:58.503 --> 1:05:00.026
and lots of team work.

1:05:00.070 --> 1:05:02.115
-You can count on us Murph.
-You can count on us Murph.

1:05:02.159 --> 1:05:03.638
-I salute you both.

1:05:03.682 --> 1:05:05.640
Jamie, Hugo, we'll need your
bikes,

1:05:05.684 --> 1:05:07.947
and your friends
and their bikes.

1:05:07.991 --> 1:05:10.776
Robert, I'll need your car.

1:05:10.819 --> 1:05:12.952
-Hold on Mr. Murph,

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:14.649
you're going to need our car?

1:05:14.693 --> 1:05:18.131
-Yes exactly, your pickup truck to be precise.

1:05:18.175 --> 1:05:21.091
-Right, and, um, you're going to
be driving it naturally?

1:05:21.134 --> 1:05:23.310
- [laughs] I'm flattered sir,

1:05:23.354 --> 1:05:24.877
but I have enough trouble

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.792
with a doorknob let alone
a steering wheel.

1:05:26.835 --> 1:05:29.229
No, I'm afraid I wont,
but you will.

1:05:29.273 --> 1:05:31.623
- [laughs]

1:05:35.453 --> 1:05:38.891
[sighs]

1:05:44.114 --> 1:05:46.159
-Pardon me for saying so Agent,
but I get the feeling

1:05:46.203 --> 1:05:49.075
we're about to hit the point
of diminishing returns here.

1:05:49.119 --> 1:05:51.860
-Diminishing returns?

1:05:51.904 --> 1:05:53.601
Do you think this country
of ours

1:05:53.645 --> 1:05:55.952
was built by people who gave up
when they felt they were about

1:05:55.995 --> 1:05:59.172
to hit the point of diminishing
returns?

1:05:59.216 --> 1:06:01.348
-Well, probably not,
but that's not really what I--

1:06:01.392 --> 1:06:03.263
-Probably not is right!

1:06:03.307 --> 1:06:07.180
And that's why we're not
going to give up.

1:06:07.224 --> 1:06:08.747
If I had a nickel for

1:06:08.790 --> 1:06:13.578
every time someone doubted
me and I proved them wrong...

1:06:15.841 --> 1:06:17.974
-What?

1:06:18.017 --> 1:06:21.499
What is it?

1:06:26.939 --> 1:06:29.507
Jackpot!

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:31.291
-You sure you're good with this?

1:06:31.335 --> 1:06:32.945
-Good with it?

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:36.122
No offense but this is the most
fun I've had in years [laughs].

1:06:36.166 --> 1:06:38.907
How are you doing there
little fella?

1:06:38.951 --> 1:06:41.562
-He's such a cutie, ready?

1:06:41.606 --> 1:06:43.129
-Let's start her up.

1:06:43.173 --> 1:06:44.304
-Here goes nothin'.

1:06:44.348 --> 1:06:47.351
[engine starting]

1:06:53.226 --> 1:06:55.620
-It's game time.

1:06:56.882 --> 1:06:59.754
[suspenseful music]

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:09.721
-So far so good.

1:07:10.722 --> 1:07:13.072
-Nice!

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:15.683
-Now this is the last time
I'm going to ask.

1:07:15.727 --> 1:07:17.903
Does anyone have to go
to the bathroom?

1:07:17.946 --> 1:07:19.731
[together]
No!

1:07:19.774 --> 1:07:21.037
-Are you sure!

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:22.516
[together]
Yes!

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.344
-Okay, I'm not one for big
speeches,

1:07:24.388 --> 1:07:26.259
but if there was ever a moment
for one--

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:28.609
-Okay, okay, let's cut to
the chase.

1:07:28.653 --> 1:07:30.437
-Fine, are you ready Hugo?

1:07:30.481 --> 1:07:33.092
-I'm like lunch meat,
I'm always ready.

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:34.354
-Now remember lunch meat,

1:07:34.398 --> 1:07:35.790
as soon as the old shed

1:07:35.834 --> 1:07:37.314
comes into view.

1:07:37.357 --> 1:07:39.620
All you guys immediately
pull over and stop.

1:07:39.664 --> 1:07:41.448
I got a plan that will get me

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:44.625
out of this situation and
ultimately save you guys too,

1:07:44.669 --> 1:07:47.585
assuming of course that your
parents have done their job.

1:07:47.628 --> 1:07:49.239
-They'll do it!

1:07:49.282 --> 1:07:51.284
-Hugo is right,
they won't let us down.

1:07:51.328 --> 1:07:52.720
-Good, now when that happens

1:07:52.764 --> 1:07:54.809
do not under any circumstances

1:07:54.853 --> 1:07:56.768
follow me into the shed,
do you understand?

1:07:56.811 --> 1:07:58.465
[together]
-Yes.

1:07:58.509 --> 1:07:59.945
-Those government agents

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:02.252
have to see me enter
that shed alone.

1:08:02.295 --> 1:08:03.992
-Are you sure that's
a good idea?

1:08:04.036 --> 1:08:07.213
-Yeah, won't you be
cornered then?

1:08:07.257 --> 1:08:09.476
-Trust me guys,
this is how it has to happen,

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:10.564
It's for the best.

1:08:10.608 --> 1:08:12.000
-Okay, I trust you.

1:08:12.044 --> 1:08:13.132
-Me too.

1:08:13.176 --> 1:08:14.655
-We all do.

1:08:14.699 --> 1:08:16.440
-Good, then let's make some
magic shall we?

1:08:16.483 --> 1:08:18.529
Janelle, can you lift me up
and put me in the basket?

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:21.358
-Right away.

1:08:24.796 --> 1:08:25.971
-Watch the hair, watch
the hair.

1:08:26.014 --> 1:08:27.015
Ah, who turned out the
lights?

1:08:27.059 --> 1:08:28.495
-There you go Murphy.

1:08:28.539 --> 1:08:30.236
-I am blind, I cannot see.

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:33.239
-Ready.

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:35.459
-Okay, let's go, go, go!

1:08:52.563 --> 1:08:54.478
-Back it off!

1:08:55.218 --> 1:08:57.872
[suspenseful music]

1:08:58.351 --> 1:09:01.137
All right.

1:09:02.181 --> 1:09:04.444
I hope you're taking notes
Agent Sheppard.

1:09:04.488 --> 1:09:07.969
What you're witnessing
firsthand is a textbook tail.

1:09:08.013 --> 1:09:09.841
-Most definitely ma'am.

1:09:09.884 --> 1:09:11.321
-Good!

1:09:11.364 --> 1:09:12.670
If you've been paying attention
you've probably noticed

1:09:12.713 --> 1:09:14.498
we've maintained
five car lengths of distance

1:09:14.541 --> 1:09:17.065
at all times between our
respective vehicles.

1:09:17.109 --> 1:09:18.415
-Yes ma'am.

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:20.156
-If you want to move up
in the ranks Agent

1:09:20.199 --> 1:09:21.635
stick with me,

1:09:21.679 --> 1:09:24.247
I can teach you a lot.

1:09:26.727 --> 1:09:28.555
-I've learned so much already.

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:29.643
-They probably don't even know

1:09:29.687 --> 1:09:31.689
they're being surveyed
right now.

1:09:31.732 --> 1:09:34.779
Clueless civilians. [laughs]

1:09:43.222 --> 1:09:46.399
-Wow, you'd think they'd try

1:09:46.443 --> 1:09:50.751
and be a little more
stealthy back there.

1:09:50.795 --> 1:09:52.710
-Maybe they want us to
know they're following us.

1:09:52.753 --> 1:09:54.320
-Yeah, maybe we're not
giving them enough credit,

1:09:54.364 --> 1:09:56.496
maybe it's all part
of their plan.

1:09:56.540 --> 1:09:58.411
-Nah!
-Nah!

1:09:58.455 --> 1:10:00.326
[laughter]

1:10:00.370 --> 1:10:02.415
-According to my doggy clock
which runs a little fast,

1:10:02.459 --> 1:10:03.808
your parents should be
pulling over

1:10:03.851 --> 1:10:06.332
to the side of the road
right about now.

1:10:06.376 --> 1:10:08.639
-Sounds good to me.

1:10:17.474 --> 1:10:19.127
-What time is it?

1:10:19.171 --> 1:10:22.174
-It's time!

1:10:28.267 --> 1:10:30.487
-End of phase one.

1:10:32.445 --> 1:10:36.536
-Brake it, brake it.

1:10:36.580 --> 1:10:38.712
That probably could've been
a little smoother.

1:10:38.756 --> 1:10:41.367
-I'll do better next time,
I promise.

1:10:41.411 --> 1:10:45.371
I think our cover's been blown.

1:10:45.415 --> 1:10:47.547
-Not likely, remember,

1:10:47.591 --> 1:10:49.462
we're dealing with
civilans here.

1:10:49.506 --> 1:10:52.073
We're highly trained
special agents.

1:10:52.117 --> 1:10:54.380
They don't think the way we do.

1:10:54.424 --> 1:10:56.469
Now we just sit back

1:10:56.513 --> 1:10:59.080
and wait for them to make
the next move.

1:10:59.124 --> 1:11:01.257
-I think they're making it.

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:03.694
[door opening]

1:11:14.966 --> 1:11:18.839
[upbeat bluegrass music]

1:11:20.841 --> 1:11:23.409
-You got to be kidding me.

1:11:23.453 --> 1:11:25.629
-We've been duped.

1:11:25.672 --> 1:11:29.372
-Yes, we have!

1:11:30.634 --> 1:11:32.984
Chopper six, Chopper six,
what do you got?

1:11:33.027 --> 1:11:34.507
[helicopter]
-I got eyes on 'em ma'am.

1:11:34.551 --> 1:11:36.422
They're currently headed
due north.

1:11:36.466 --> 1:11:38.859
They've been on the road now
for about 15 minutes.

1:11:38.903 --> 1:11:40.644
Here, I'll send you a picture.

1:11:40.687 --> 1:11:42.123
Over.

1:11:42.167 --> 1:11:44.474
[beeps]

1:11:47.912 --> 1:11:49.174
-Excellent.

1:11:49.217 --> 1:11:51.350
Time to put on your big
boy pants Agent.

1:11:51.394 --> 1:11:54.788
No mutt makes a fool out of
Camilla Sharp.

1:11:54.832 --> 1:11:57.225
And I'm driving!

1:11:58.357 --> 1:12:01.055
[suspenseful music]

1:12:06.713 --> 1:12:09.673
[engine starting]

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:25.428
-That chopper's heading
right for us!

1:12:28.213 --> 1:12:32.739
-Come one guys, keep pedaling.

1:12:32.783 --> 1:12:36.526
What did you get us into
this time Jamie?

1:12:42.096 --> 1:12:44.185
-Faster guys, they're gaining
on us!

1:12:44.229 --> 1:12:45.578
Like my mommy used to say,

1:12:45.622 --> 1:12:47.885
"Push the medal to the pedal."

1:12:49.713 --> 1:12:51.584
-It's still coming.

1:12:51.628 --> 1:12:53.281
-[screams] Go faster!

1:12:53.325 --> 1:12:54.413
-Come on guys!

1:12:54.457 --> 1:12:56.067
We can make it,
just a little further.

1:12:56.110 --> 1:12:58.025
-Stay calm buddy. Stay calm.

1:12:58.069 --> 1:13:00.854
-I'm trying, I'm a dog
on a bike.

1:13:00.898 --> 1:13:02.203
[helicopter]
-Chopper six to home plate

1:13:02.247 --> 1:13:03.509
turning back to base

1:13:03.553 --> 1:13:05.424
area too heavily wooded
to pursue.

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:08.427
Letting ground ops take over.

1:13:08.471 --> 1:13:10.647
-Are we there yet?

1:13:14.607 --> 1:13:16.217
Well, that was interesting.

1:13:16.261 --> 1:13:17.436
Anybody got a doggy bag.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:19.133
-That was close
with those choppers.

1:13:19.177 --> 1:13:21.788
-Too close, like I almost messed
my shorts close.

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:24.530
-Shorts, yeah,
I never got that.

1:13:24.574 --> 1:13:26.576
Okay, look, um,

1:13:26.619 --> 1:13:29.143
I'm going to have to do this
alone, okay?

1:13:29.187 --> 1:13:30.623
-I'm not leaving.

1:13:30.667 --> 1:13:32.886
-Hugo, you promised, remember?

1:13:32.930 --> 1:13:35.454
I don't wanna,
but I will for you Murphy.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:36.324
-Good.

1:13:36.368 --> 1:13:37.891
-Your real brave you know.

1:13:37.935 --> 1:13:39.458
-You really think so?

1:13:39.502 --> 1:13:41.112
-Yeah.

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:44.115
-Um, kids, I'm actually at
a loss for words here,

1:13:44.158 --> 1:13:46.987
you know, but you got to get out of here now understand?

1:13:47.031 --> 1:13:49.468
-I do. Goodbye Murphy.

1:13:49.512 --> 1:13:50.904
-Goodbye kiddo.

1:13:50.948 --> 1:13:52.166
You're a brave kid Jamie.

1:13:52.210 --> 1:13:53.516
-Thanks Murph.

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:55.169
-You could be a great leader
someday.

1:13:55.213 --> 1:13:58.564
These kids really look up
to you, especially Hugo.

1:13:58.608 --> 1:14:00.827
Now, I've never been good
with goodbyes

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:04.788
so um, Janelle, could you
kind of help me

1:14:04.831 --> 1:14:08.966
out of the basket here?

1:14:09.009 --> 1:14:11.795
Oopsy daisy.[groans]

1:14:13.013 --> 1:14:15.189
See ya!

1:14:15.233 --> 1:14:17.104
-So long Murph.

1:14:17.148 --> 1:14:19.846
-So long Murph,
we'll see you again.

1:14:23.546 --> 1:14:25.156
-I'm getting worried
about the kids.

1:14:25.199 --> 1:14:28.333
-Yeah, I hope they had as much
success as we did.

1:14:40.345 --> 1:14:43.043
-There he is!

1:14:52.096 --> 1:14:55.360
-I hope this works!

1:15:05.675 --> 1:15:10.070
Here we go, like they say
don't try this at home.

1:15:11.463 --> 1:15:14.292
I'm ready for my closeup.

1:15:15.206 --> 1:15:17.687
It's showtime!

1:15:18.470 --> 1:15:20.951
-Murphy!

1:15:25.608 --> 1:15:27.435
-That wasn't part of the plan.

1:15:27.479 --> 1:15:31.439
-Where are the boys,
I don't see them.

1:15:31.483 --> 1:15:34.225
-There they are.

1:15:37.576 --> 1:15:41.275
-What in the holy heck
just happened?

1:15:41.319 --> 1:15:44.757
-Murphy!

1:15:44.801 --> 1:15:45.932
-Are you guys okay?

1:15:45.976 --> 1:15:47.107
-Yeah, we're fine.

1:15:47.151 --> 1:15:49.414
-What about Murphy?

1:15:49.457 --> 1:15:53.549
[flames crackling]

1:15:53.592 --> 1:15:55.855
-Well, looks like that
does it for the mutt.

1:15:55.899 --> 1:15:57.248
-Seems so.

1:15:57.291 --> 1:15:58.858
-Looks like there's nothing
left for us to do

1:15:58.902 --> 1:16:01.295
but pack up and clear out of
this one horse town.

1:16:01.339 --> 1:16:04.255
Let the locals clean it up,
am I right agent?

1:16:05.952 --> 1:16:07.432
-Yes ma'am.

1:16:09.913 --> 1:16:14.787
[phone ringing]

1:16:14.831 --> 1:16:16.180
-Sheppard.

1:16:16.223 --> 1:16:18.269
-I just heard there was a big
explosion, is he--

1:16:18.312 --> 1:16:23.274
-Yeah, afraid so,
Murphy's gone.

1:16:25.668 --> 1:16:27.583
-Hey Agent Sheppard,
you might want to stick around

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:30.629
for the third act twist,
it's a good one.

1:16:30.673 --> 1:16:32.718
-What's that ma'am?

1:16:32.762 --> 1:16:33.980
-Didn't say anything.

1:16:34.024 --> 1:16:35.895
-Of course not, I did.

1:16:35.939 --> 1:16:38.419
-You need to get your hearing
checked once we get back to DC.

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:40.944
-Did you hear that?
Get your hearing checked.

1:16:40.987 --> 1:16:43.163
You know a doctor's appointment is very, very important.

1:16:43.207 --> 1:16:44.904
Your eyes too.

1:16:44.948 --> 1:16:45.775
You have any glasses,
maybe you would put those on.

1:16:45.818 --> 1:16:47.907
Yeah, there you go.

1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:53.173
-Well, that's not a great
start to Christmas Eve.

1:16:53.217 --> 1:16:55.828
-Yeah, but at least
we still have each other.

1:16:55.872 --> 1:16:59.049
-Yeah, yeah we do.

1:17:03.662 --> 1:17:06.360
[fire crackling]

1:17:06.404 --> 1:17:09.233
-Okay, who's ready for some
hot chocolate?

1:17:11.017 --> 1:17:15.456
Who's going to drink all this
hot chocolate that I made?

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.024
I can't possibly drink all this
hot chocolate by myself.

1:17:18.068 --> 1:17:19.678
I mean I could try to drink
it all by myself.

1:17:19.722 --> 1:17:21.985
Let's see.

1:17:25.336 --> 1:17:27.860
Yeah, that's a lot
of hot chocolate.

1:17:27.904 --> 1:17:29.906
[phone dings]

1:17:32.691 --> 1:17:35.999
Hey guys, honey, honey,
can you, can you come in here?

1:17:36.042 --> 1:17:37.391
You need to see this.

1:17:37.435 --> 1:17:38.566
-Dad what is it?

1:17:38.610 --> 1:17:40.699
-Yeah, what is it?

1:17:41.874 --> 1:17:43.659
-Mr. Gernsback,

1:17:43.702 --> 1:17:45.138

[knock at door]

1:18:06.029 --> 1:18:07.030
Maybe it did.

1:18:07.073 --> 1:18:08.031
-Who is it?

1:18:08.074 --> 1:18:09.597
-Maybe that's Santa
out there.

1:18:09.641 --> 1:18:11.774
Boys, what do you think, do you
think that might be Santa?

1:18:13.210 --> 1:18:16.517
Santa?
You're definitely not Santa.

1:18:16.561 --> 1:18:18.737
-Sorry to disappoint
Mr. Gernsback.

1:18:18.781 --> 1:18:20.347

-Murphy!
-Murphy!

1:18:32.664 --> 1:18:34.927
-Kids, we've got company!

1:18:34.971 --> 1:18:36.450
-Well, it ain't Rudolph.

1:18:36.494 --> 1:18:38.235
Hey, huh?

1:18:38.278 --> 1:18:40.367

1:18:52.162 --> 1:18:54.381
-You were wrong Mr. FBI.
