12:23.882 --> 12:29.248
I thought if I could bring some
male leadership into his life--

12:29.315 --> 12:32.082
What gang was your son
trying to join, Mrs. Johnson?

12:33.015 --> 12:35.282
One he was in.

12:35.348 --> 12:37.382
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>"The Bangers."</i>

12:37.448 --> 12:41.582
- <i>Your son had a relationship</i>
with the defendant?
- Going back five years...

12:41.648 --> 12:45.615
<i>to when he was 11,</i>
<i>when he started</i>
<i>selling drugs for him.</i>

12:45.682 --> 12:49.082
Charlie started selling drugs
for the defendant?

12:49.148 --> 12:52.682
- Yes.
- When he was 11 years old?

12:52.748 --> 12:55.215
Yes.

12:55.282 --> 12:57.248
Did you know about this
at the time?
<i>Yes.</i>

12:58.482 --> 13:02.948
I did everything I could,
but Charlie looked up to him,

13:03.015 --> 13:05.748
<i>wanted to be like him.</i>

13:05.815 --> 13:08.315
Instead he was killed by him.

13:11.115 --> 13:15.082
You talked about trying
to steer your son
away from gangs.

13:15.148 --> 13:17.782
- He didn't have
a father, did he?
- No.

13:17.848 --> 13:21.248
And you work
at a gas station
as an attendant,

13:21.315 --> 13:24.882
and, uh, your hours are
from 3:00 p.m. to midnight?

13:24.948 --> 13:27.682
Yes.

13:28.782 --> 13:30.748
Mrs. Johnson,

13:30.815 --> 13:33.848
how often did you see Charles
during any given week?

13:33.915 --> 13:39.448
I know... that I couldn't
be there for him
as much as I wanted.

13:39.515 --> 13:41.982
[ Eugene ]
I understand that.

13:42.048 --> 13:44.548
Mrs. Johnson, was there anybody
who looked out for your son?

13:44.615 --> 13:48.215
Well, if you call
gettin' him to sell drugs
looking out for him.

13:48.282 --> 13:52.115
On the Columbus block where you
live, what percentage of boys
ended up joining gangs?

13:52.182 --> 13:54.448
Most.
Most?

13:54.515 --> 13:57.382
[ Eugene ]
And you testified that your son
looked up to my client.

13:57.448 --> 14:02.248
In fact, you often thought
that my client helped keep
your son alive, didn't you?

14:04.848 --> 14:07.048
I'd ask that you please
respond to my question, ma'am.

14:07.115 --> 14:10.082
I will answer
your question, sir.

14:11.382 --> 14:14.015
Did I often appreciate him
lookin' out for my boy?

14:14.082 --> 14:16.382
Yes.

14:16.448 --> 14:19.482
And I know
they was friends.

14:19.548 --> 14:22.682
But he got him involved
in drugs, he got him
into gang business,

14:22.748 --> 14:24.748
and with his own hands,
he killed him.

14:24.815 --> 14:28.615
So don't you dare be sayin'
I should be sittin' here...

14:29.882 --> 14:32.415
lookin' at him grateful.

14:48.848 --> 14:52.282
Well, yeah, I'm putting up
the detective. I should only
do about 10 minutes though.

14:52.348 --> 14:54.515

14:56.648 --> 14:58.982
Well, we should rest

activist too, and there's
a waiver on rats, okay?

15:13.482 --> 15:15.515

Well, then get down there

That is one dead rat.

16:00.982 --> 16:02.848
I just don't like
the feel of it.

16:02.915 --> 16:06.782
Uh, I thought we had a shot,
but now my gut says
take the manslaughter.

16:06.848 --> 16:10.215
But even the doctors say
it was a fluke the way
the boy died.

16:10.282 --> 16:13.048
Mrs. Burnette, he died from
gettin' punched in the head.

16:13.115 --> 16:17.448
Now, if Raymond
didn't have a record,
I'd say let's roll the dice.

16:17.515 --> 16:20.082
But now I say
let's take the manslaughter.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.315
How long will he have
to go to jail for that?

I'd be hoping for four.

I want him for
murder two.

16:39.015 --> 16:41.315
Oh, come on, Curtis.
Yesterday you offered
manslaughter.

16:41.382 --> 16:43.982
That was yesterday.
So what's changed?

16:44.048 --> 16:47.948
What's changed is I was lookin'
at that boy's mother on the
stand and I just got sick of it.

16:48.015 --> 16:50.548
I am sick of hearing
"didn't mean it"
from the gangs.

16:50.615 --> 16:52.715
It's time they started
takin' resp--
Come on, Curtis.

16:52.782 --> 16:55.615

I didn't like what
I heard from you.

Which was these kids got
nowhere else to turn but gangs.

There's nobody there
for them but gangs.

17:00.848 --> 17:03.282
You don't think
there's truth in that?
That is not an excuse.

17:03.348 --> 17:06.415
Now, look, I was raised
by a single parent.

17:06.482 --> 17:10.382
I lived in those neighborhoods,
and I got out, Eugene.
Kids do make other choices.

17:10.448 --> 17:13.882
So you got out. I'm happy
for you. That doesn't mean
my guy should get murder two.

17:13.948 --> 17:16.848
A kid is dead

give her some equity.

that he has to go with

19:46.757 --> 19:49.623
And that was you?
I didn't say that,
but, uh--

19:49.690 --> 19:52.123

24:25.357 --> 24:27.857
- <i>You didn't get out</i>
<i>of your car.</i>
- No, I didn't.

24:27.923 --> 24:30.590
<i>Why not?</i>
I suppose I was afraid to.

24:30.657 --> 24:34.290
I was in a very bad area
driving a Mercedes.

24:34.357 --> 24:38.190
- I didn't really wanna get out.
- But you struck a man.

24:38.257 --> 24:42.157
Yes, but I thought he'd run off.
Plus, I wasn't sure
it wasn't staged.

24:42.223 --> 24:45.990
- <i>Staged?</i>
- I thought he made it
seem like I hit him...

24:46.057 --> 24:49.023
so I would stop, get out--
only to be mugged.

24:49.090 --> 24:52.723
Like I said, I was in
an awful neighborhood.
I was afraid.

24:52.790 --> 24:54.890
Don't you think you should've
at least checked?

24:54.957 --> 24:57.423
You hear a thump.
You think you hit somebody.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.557
I did check.
I looked around.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.623
You stayed in your car.

25:01.690 --> 25:03.890
If a man were prone
on the ground,

25:03.957 --> 25:07.523
how will you see him
from in your car,
especially at night?

25:07.590 --> 25:10.923
In retrospect, I-I probably
should have gotten out.

25:10.990 --> 25:12.957
But like I said,
I was afraid.

25:13.023 --> 25:15.490
But you didn't even
call the police.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.223
Well, I probably should have.

25:18.290 --> 25:21.590
- Why didn't you?
- Because I thought it was
just a robbery attempt,

25:21.657 --> 25:25.990
and since I hadn't been
victimized, I didn't figure
the police to do anything.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.957
So you didn't even call them.
You had a car phone?

25:29.023 --> 25:34.523
Look, I was scared.
I didn't think I hurt anybody.

25:34.590 --> 25:37.690
And the only thing
going through my mind was
"get the hell out of there."

25:40.023 --> 25:43.590
Why didn't you notify
the insurance company?
Your car was damaged.

25:43.657 --> 25:45.957
Well, I-- I was going to.

Now, some gangs require that
you go out and cap somebody...

three times convicted
on drug offenses,

26:21.657 --> 26:24.457
twice on prior assaults.

26:24.523 --> 26:29.957
And this is the man
who lured the victim into drugs,
into gang life.

26:30.023 --> 26:33.790
And this is the man who killed
the victim with his fists.

outreach programs? Great.

27:08.857 --> 27:10.923
But first--

27:10.990 --> 27:15.457
first, ladies and gentlemen,
we must attack gang violence
head-on.

27:15.523 --> 27:18.090
If you kill, you go to jail,
damn it.

27:18.157 --> 27:22.090
Don't tell me you had
a lousy homelife. Don't tell me
your dad was a drunk.

<i>But this trial isn't about</i>
<i>putting an end to gangs</i>
<i>or gang violence.</i>

28:04.323 --> 28:06.257
All this trial is about--

28:06.323 --> 28:08.223
All this trial is about...

28:08.290 --> 28:11.723
is whether this man intended
to kill Charles Johnson,

28:11.790 --> 28:16.323
<i>or was he so reckless that</i>
<i>he should have known he put</i>
<i>the victim at extreme risk.</i>

28:16.390 --> 28:20.223
He didn't.
You heard the doctors--
crushed windpipe.

28:20.290 --> 28:23.757
Now, was it foreseeable
that Raymond with one punch
was going to kill his friend?

28:23.823 --> 28:26.390
Of course not.
Did he want to kill him?
You know he didn't.

28:26.457 --> 28:31.257
He wasn't even trying
to hurt him. You know that
and so does the prosecution.

28:31.323 --> 28:34.257
That's why when he got up here,
he didn't go after
Raymond Burnette...

28:34.323 --> 28:36.290
as much as he went
after the gangs.

28:36.357 --> 28:41.657
He said, "Let's stop
these gangs. The gangs are the
culprits." And maybe he's right.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.790
But this isn't a forum
to cure the ills of society.

28:46.857 --> 28:50.823
This is about one death,
one defendant and his intent.

28:50.890 --> 28:54.990
And if you don't find that
intent, you cannot punish him
just because he's in a gang.

28:55.057 --> 28:58.757
Who or what he is,
that is not on trial here.

28:58.823 --> 29:03.823
If it were, I might say convict.
For the sake of my son,
I'd pray that you would.

29:05.857 --> 29:09.523
But this trial
is about the act.

I guess the only question
for you to go back and decide--

37:17.856 --> 37:21.556
Is there any intrinsic value

38:01.790 --> 38:05.590
on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

38:05.656 --> 38:09.723
we find the defendant,
Raymond Burnette, not guilty.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.823
[ Judge Camp ]
The defendant is free to go.

38:12.890 --> 38:15.156
The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

38:15.223 --> 38:17.723
[ Gavel Raps ]

38:29.490 --> 38:33.223
Yo. I don't know how
to say thanks, man.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.023
You know you did that, man.
[ Chuckles ]

[ Machinery Clanks ]

38:39.656 --> 38:41.923
You asked me before
if I was gonna save your son.

38:41.990 --> 38:45.356
I told you I'd try to
keep him out of jail. I did.
Whether or not he's saved,

38:45.423 --> 38:47.356
that's up to the two of you.

38:47.423 --> 38:49.390
You don't know
how to say thanks?

38:49.456 --> 38:53.990
From now on, every time
you see a 10-year-old kid,
you pretend he's mine.

38:56.356 --> 38:59.556
[ Machinery Whirs ]

39:02.923 --> 39:07.223
For her perseverance
in preserving both
the Roxbury Animal Shelter...

39:07.290 --> 39:11.190
and her fund-raising efforts
to help build
the Jamaica Plain Shelter,

39:11.256 --> 39:15.390
it is my great pleasure
to present the 1998
Basset Hound Award...

39:15.456 --> 39:17.723
to Ms. Rebecca Washington.

39:31.390 --> 39:33.390
Thank you so much.

39:33.456 --> 39:36.623
Uh, I-I was so honored
to come here today--

39:36.690 --> 39:39.723
especially to be honored
for doing something I love.

39:39.790 --> 39:43.323
I so love dogs.
[ Chuckles ]
But, um,

39:43.390 --> 39:48.723
I-I-I have to be honest
in saying that, uh,
I'm-I'm a little thrown.

39:48.790 --> 39:50.856
Uh--
[ Clears Throat ]
[ Microphone Feedback ]

39:50.923 --> 39:54.790
Okay. Two days ago,
I-I-I killed a rat in my office.

39:54.856 --> 39:58.923
And I guess
there are some people
in the association...

39:58.990 --> 40:04.723
<i>who are considering taking</i>
<i>the trophy back from me</i>
<i>because of that.</i>

40:04.790 --> 40:07.623
So, um,
I'm-I'm just gonna say this.

40:07.690 --> 40:10.456
[ Chuckles ]
I hate rats.

40:10.523 --> 40:14.256
Love dogs. But rats,
they're filthy,

40:14.323 --> 40:17.256
disgusting,
scummy little things.

40:17.323 --> 40:19.290
And they may be one
of God's creatures,

40:19.356 --> 40:21.456
but they certainly don't
represent his best work.

40:21.523 --> 40:23.956
And if one tries
to run up my leg,

40:24.023 --> 40:26.690
I will not apologize
for stomping it to death.

40:26.756 --> 40:29.756
Rats, they-they--
they're ugly.

40:29.823 --> 40:33.990
They got mashed-up faces,
and they carry germs and rabies.

40:34.056 --> 40:36.656
And come on.
Let's all fess up.

40:36.723 --> 40:40.090
You'd all poison them
if they were runnin' around
your house.

40:40.156 --> 40:45.756
Now, part of me likes
those spring traps,
'cause they make them suffer.

40:45.823 --> 40:48.656
And then the scummy little rat
squeaks out in pain,

40:48.723 --> 40:51.523
and the rest of the rats
know better than to come
in the area.

40:51.590 --> 40:55.756
You-You ever seen
a drowned one in a pool?
It's nasty.

40:55.823 --> 40:58.156
So, I--
I ain't savin' no rat.

40:58.223 --> 41:02.823
<i>And if this costs me</i>
<i>this award, then so be it.</i>

41:02.890 --> 41:06.623
I just hope I get to
hold on to this long enough
so I can use it...

41:06.690 --> 41:09.890
to bash in
one little rat head.

41:12.090 --> 41:14.290
Otherwise, I thank you.

41:21.790 --> 41:23.756
[ Clangs ]

41:26.656 --> 41:28.790
I got it.
Thank you.

41:28.856 --> 41:30.756
Yeah.
Thank you.

41:32.723 --> 41:35.056
Not guilty?
Yeah. You too?

41:35.123 --> 41:37.990
Yeah.
See ya.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.823
Hey.
Hey.

42:00.890 --> 42:02.656
How'd the luncheon go?

42:02.723 --> 42:05.123
Had to leave.
My jury came back.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.923
Good?

42:09.456 --> 42:11.456
I don't think
you'd like it.

42:14.023 --> 42:17.490
I'm still all dressed up.
Get a drink or somethin'?

42:20.523 --> 42:24.356
Actually, I'd like
to go for a walk.
Feel like walking?

42:24.423 --> 42:26.956
It's cold out there.

42:27.023 --> 42:29.490
Tell me about it.

42:44.423 --> 42:46.256
[ Sighs ]
Rebecca okay?

42:46.323 --> 42:50.756
Yeah. I think
she's just feeling
the stress of everything.

42:50.823 --> 42:55.290
- And-- And that, uh--
- She hates rats.

42:56.923 --> 42:58.790
Yeah.
<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

43:00.356 --> 43:04.390
Listen, are you lashing
out because of... us?

43:04.456 --> 43:07.890
Or-Or do you
really believe that--

43:10.223 --> 43:12.290
Both.

43:12.356 --> 43:16.356
I'm sure part of
my frustration's got nothin'
to do with the practice.

43:16.423 --> 43:18.556
But part of it does.

43:20.323 --> 43:22.323
I know what you want
this place to be.

43:22.390 --> 43:24.956
And I think I can help you--

43:25.023 --> 43:27.490
- [ Sighs ]
- What?

43:27.556 --> 43:31.056
- Nothing.
- What?

43:35.456 --> 43:38.256
I'm right here, Bobby.

43:38.323 --> 43:40.390
I'm standing right here.

43:50.723 --> 43:52.656
Uh--

43:55.390 --> 43:57.623
I'll, uh--

44:00.323 --> 44:02.356
I'll think
this office stuff through.

44:04.123 --> 44:06.023
Okay.
