<i>A much too fast recap</i>
<i>of last week's</i> Taxi.

01:02.784 --> 01:04.450
<i>Louie got this phone call.</i>

01:04.518 --> 01:06.217
<i>John had wrecked cab 804.</i>

01:06.284 --> 01:07.650
804?

01:07.717 --> 01:08.817
I was in 804

01:08.884 --> 01:10.017
<i>the night I got held up.</i>

01:10.084 --> 01:11.583
<i>Remember</i>
<i>when I started carrying</i>

01:11.650 --> 01:13.351
<i>that big gun around</i>
<i>for protection?</i>

01:13.418 --> 01:15.683
Just want the fare money, son.
No games.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.384
Okay, drop it!

01:17.451 --> 01:18.184
Drop it?

01:18.750 --> 01:20.583
Hey, man.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.284
You ain't no fun
to stick up, man.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.617
Hey, I saved a guy's life
once in 804.

01:31.284 --> 01:33.317
Hey, don't do that!

01:36.117 --> 01:38.117
Okay.

01:38.184 --> 01:41.351
Hey, maybe we're all
getting upset for nothing.

01:41.418 --> 01:44.917
I mean, we don't know for sure
that 804 is totaled.

01:44.984 --> 01:46.251
JOHN:
Hi, everybody.

01:46.317 --> 01:48.418
Hey, everything's all right.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.817
I'm fine.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.817
Just look at
that grillwork.

02:19.884 --> 02:21.750
I can't look
at her anymore.

02:21.817 --> 02:24.051
Well, we'll know soon enough.

02:24.117 --> 02:26.583
804 is about to go
under the wrench.

02:26.650 --> 02:29.583
It's going to take
a miracle to save her.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.984
I wish it was me that was going
under the wrench.

02:33.051 --> 02:34.984
Oh, John...

02:35.051 --> 02:37.317
Come on. Don't
feel so bad.

02:37.384 --> 02:39.151
It was just
an accident.

02:39.217 --> 02:41.151
It could happen
to any of us.

02:41.217 --> 02:42.550
Right?

02:44.583 --> 02:46.418
Either of us.

02:50.784 --> 02:52.784
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

02:52.850 --> 02:54.117
TONY:
Latka! Latka!

02:54.184 --> 02:55.451
How you doing?

02:55.518 --> 02:57.617
We're counting
on you, Latka.

02:57.683 --> 02:59.484
Take as much time
as you need.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.484
As much time
as you need, right?

03:01.550 --> 03:03.117
We know you can do it, buddy.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.418
I still say we should have
got a specialist.

03:05.484 --> 03:07.351
ALEX:
No, Latka'll do fine.
He's our man.

03:07.418 --> 03:09.151
Hey, if he can't fix it,
nobody can.

03:09.217 --> 03:10.984
Wait till he sees the cab.

03:11.051 --> 03:12.683
Eh, trust.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.850
No need for specialist.

03:14.917 --> 03:16.583
I can fix it.

03:19.084 --> 03:20.583
Mm-hmm.

03:23.051 --> 03:24.550
Mm-hmm.

03:28.550 --> 03:29.817
Mm-hmm.

03:32.418 --> 03:34.017
I quit.

03:34.084 --> 03:35.650
Latka, no!

03:35.717 --> 03:38.317
Come on. You got
to go get 'em, boy.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.017
Yeah, Latka,
do your best.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.550
Please,
Latka, please!

03:41.617 --> 03:43.583
Save her, will you,
please?

03:49.784 --> 03:52.017
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

03:52.084 --> 03:53.351
...Genius!

03:53.418 --> 03:55.418
( <i>still speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

03:57.084 --> 03:59.617
Hey, let's forget about this.

03:59.683 --> 04:02.451
I mean, I feel just as bad
as any of you

04:02.518 --> 04:05.717
but standing around like this
isn't going to help.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.217
( <i>sighing</i> )

04:07.284 --> 04:08.984
You want to hear
a story

04:09.051 --> 04:11.384
about what happened
to me in 804?

04:11.451 --> 04:13.418
Yeah.

04:13.484 --> 04:17.117
Well, it's just about this guy
I picked up one night...

04:18.517 --> 04:20.317
What's wrong?

04:20.384 --> 04:22.251
I thought when it came
to passengers, you never, uh...

04:22.317 --> 04:23.583
No, I don't.

04:23.650 --> 04:26.750
Well... well, I mean,
you got to understand.

04:26.817 --> 04:28.418
I mean, this was special.

04:28.484 --> 04:30.884
You know, there are just
certain things in life

04:30.950 --> 04:32.650
that a girl can't resist.

04:32.717 --> 04:33.984
ALEX:
Like what?

04:34.051 --> 04:36.151
Well, like an auction.

04:36.217 --> 04:39.084
I mean, I hear about an auction
and I go crazy, you know?

04:39.151 --> 04:42.418
Or a ride in the country.

04:42.484 --> 04:45.017
I mean, I love
a ride in the country.

04:45.084 --> 04:48.384
Oh, and nice manners.

04:48.451 --> 04:50.917
I adore nice manners.

04:50.984 --> 04:52.984
Elaine, what's this got to do
with the guy you picked up?

04:53.051 --> 04:54.884
Well...

04:59.451 --> 05:01.117
MAN:
Excuse me, I've got

05:01.184 --> 05:03.750
to get to a private
auction in the country.

05:03.817 --> 05:05.917
Is it possible for you
to take me?

05:05.984 --> 05:07.784
I know it's
a lot to ask.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.650
I get off duty
in half an hour.

05:09.717 --> 05:10.650
How far is it?

05:10.717 --> 05:12.484
140 Miles.

05:12.550 --> 05:14.984
Oh, I don't know. 140...

05:16.484 --> 05:18.784
I can make it.

05:21.583 --> 05:22.817
Uh, this is cab 804.

05:22.884 --> 05:25.184
I'm going to be
a little late.

05:25.251 --> 05:27.351
I have
an out-of-town fare.

05:27.418 --> 05:29.683
LOUIE:
Good. How late will you be?

05:29.750 --> 05:31.251
Don't wait up.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.817
Elaine Nardo, huh?

05:43.884 --> 05:45.683
It's a good picture.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.817
Come on.
It's a terrible picture.

05:48.884 --> 05:50.384
My hair wasn't fixed

05:50.451 --> 05:52.784
and my eyes
are half-closed...

05:52.850 --> 05:54.217
It's a mug shot.

05:54.284 --> 05:56.617
Listen, maybe everybody
asks you this,

05:56.683 --> 05:58.451
but how come
you're driving a cab?

05:58.518 --> 06:00.151
There was this fat lady once.

06:00.217 --> 06:01.950
Four suitcases
and three kids.

06:02.017 --> 06:03.451
I drove her all the way
to New Jersey.

06:03.518 --> 06:05.650
The kids were hanging out
the windows,

06:05.717 --> 06:08.284
and she was screaming
at the kids to get back inside.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.683
Two of the kids even
got sick in the car.

06:10.750 --> 06:11.984
I don't get it.

06:12.051 --> 06:13.384
She's the only one

06:13.451 --> 06:16.217
who never asked me
why I drive a cab.

06:16.284 --> 06:19.418
Okay. You don't
have to tell me.

06:19.484 --> 06:21.550
I only tell
special people.

06:21.617 --> 06:24.650
The reason I drive a cab
is because I'm divorced

06:24.717 --> 06:26.484
and I need the extra money.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.484
I really work
as a receptionist

06:28.550 --> 06:29.683
at an art gallery.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.351
That gallery is what
I really care about.

06:32.418 --> 06:35.217
Uh, listen, the auction
that I'm going to

06:35.284 --> 06:36.650
is an art auction.

06:36.717 --> 06:38.617
Would you like
to join me?

06:38.683 --> 06:40.117
I'm sorry.

06:40.184 --> 06:42.084
I didn't mean
that as a come-on.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.217
No, that's not true.
I did mean that
as a come-on.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.351
Would you?

06:46.418 --> 06:48.184
Oh, I don't know.

06:48.251 --> 06:52.017
I... I couldn't date a
guy that I didn't know.

06:52.084 --> 06:54.017
What's your name anyway?

06:54.084 --> 06:55.284
Mike Beldon.

06:55.351 --> 06:57.184
Certainly good to know
you, Mike Beldon.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.650
Mike Beldon, Mike Beldon.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.017
I own a few paintings
myself,

07:11.084 --> 07:13.484
but mostly I just buy
for other people.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.717
I'm still at the
renting stage.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.583
I get them from
libraries, you know.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.650
Just having them
around the house,

07:20.717 --> 07:22.917
you know, changes the
whole atmosphere for me.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.617
This isn't like me.

07:24.683 --> 07:25.550
What isn't?

07:25.617 --> 07:27.117
I'm still not comfortable

07:27.184 --> 07:29.117
about having a passenger
ride up front.

07:29.184 --> 07:31.051
Passenger?
I thought we were friends.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.151
( <i>sighing</i> )

07:32.217 --> 07:33.984
We shouldn't be doing this.

07:34.051 --> 07:35.317
Why not?

07:35.384 --> 07:37.317
What are you afraid of?

07:37.384 --> 07:39.017
You know what I mean.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.617
It's like, you know,
here we are,

07:41.683 --> 07:43.917
sharing the same
experiences,

07:43.984 --> 07:45.950
the same interests...

07:46.017 --> 07:47.117
( <i>sighing</i> )

07:47.184 --> 07:48.384
Sort of maybe...

07:48.451 --> 07:50.518
feeling a little attracted
to each other?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.051
Maybe a little.

07:53.117 --> 07:55.617
Maybe a lot?

07:55.683 --> 07:56.750
Maybe a lot.

07:56.817 --> 07:59.717
Good.

07:59.784 --> 08:01.717
But it's too
perfect, you know?

08:01.784 --> 08:03.051
Yeah, we should stop.

08:03.117 --> 08:05.017
Something's going
to go wrong.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.817
What are you
talking about?

08:06.884 --> 08:08.950
I mean, like, I just know
it's going to turn out

08:09.017 --> 08:11.351
you're either married,
gay, or crazy.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.550
( <i>sighing</i> )

08:18.717 --> 08:20.583
I hit it, didn't I?

08:20.650 --> 08:22.617
You're one of those?

08:22.683 --> 08:24.984
Married, gay, or crazy?

08:25.051 --> 08:26.717
Yeah, you're right.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.317
Come on, crazy.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.150
Right again.

08:32.217 --> 08:33.717
Thank God.

08:41.351 --> 08:42.717
So we got divorced.

08:42.784 --> 08:44.650
I wanted kids,
she didn't.

08:44.717 --> 08:45.784
Simple as that.

08:45.850 --> 08:48.184
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.

08:48.251 --> 08:50.550
Maybe I'm just
too old-fashioned,

08:50.617 --> 08:53.484
but, uh... I still
believe in families.

08:55.151 --> 08:56.617
How about you?

08:56.683 --> 09:00.650
What is it, a tattoo somewhere
that says, "I have kids"?

09:00.717 --> 09:02.051
You knew that.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.284
See? You <i>are</i> too perfect.

09:19.117 --> 09:22.750
ELAINE:
<i>Why are we stopping?</i>

09:24.717 --> 09:26.650
We're here.

09:26.717 --> 09:28.650
Oh, you're kidding.

09:28.717 --> 09:32.051
140 miles goes
that fast, huh?

09:34.717 --> 09:36.151
Listen...

09:36.217 --> 09:38.650
There's something
I got to ask you.

09:38.717 --> 09:39.984
Great.

09:40.051 --> 09:42.184
It would seem real strange

09:42.251 --> 09:45.650
if I had to say good-bye
to you right now.

09:45.717 --> 09:48.051
So, would you
spend the night

09:48.117 --> 09:49.617
with me tonight?

09:49.683 --> 09:51.117
Believe me, I...

09:51.184 --> 09:53.650
I wouldn't rush
it like this,

09:53.717 --> 09:58.217
but I don't think
I'm going to get
another chance.

09:58.284 --> 10:01.717
So, would you spend
the night with me?

10:01.784 --> 10:03.451
You mean all night?

10:04.418 --> 10:05.650
I'm not being naive.

10:05.717 --> 10:08.284
I just want to make sure
that I understand you.

10:08.351 --> 10:09.418
All night.

10:09.484 --> 10:12.051
You mean in the same room?

10:12.117 --> 10:15.017
Not naive.
I'm just checking.

10:15.084 --> 10:16.683
Same room.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.418
Do you mean
just for tonight?

10:19.484 --> 10:21.117
( <i>sighing</i> )

10:21.184 --> 10:23.784
I have to fly to London
in the morning.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.950
What about when you come back?

10:27.017 --> 10:29.117
I don't know
when I'm coming back,

10:29.184 --> 10:32.084
and I'd hate
to make a promise
I couldn't keep.

10:34.284 --> 10:36.051
( <i>sighing</i> )

10:36.117 --> 10:37.750
You're not so perfect.

10:37.817 --> 10:40.184
You don't even know
when to lie.

10:42.151 --> 10:43.817
What about tonight?

10:48.051 --> 10:49.384
I can't...

10:49.451 --> 10:52.217
Unless there's even
the slightest chance

10:52.284 --> 10:55.017
that you might not go
to London tomorrow.

10:55.084 --> 10:57.017
Okay, there's
a slight chance.

10:57.084 --> 10:58.184
Yeah?

10:58.251 --> 10:59.518
No, that's a lie.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.650
Now, see, you happy? I'm a liar.

11:01.717 --> 11:03.251
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:03.317 --> 11:06.418
Oh, I am really sorry.

11:06.484 --> 11:09.784
I'm furious at myself
is what I am.

11:09.850 --> 11:12.084
I understand.

11:12.151 --> 11:14.117
So long.

11:15.184 --> 11:16.617
( <i>sighing</i> )

11:16.683 --> 11:18.451
A kiss we can do.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.784
What was
that question again?

11:35.850 --> 11:37.784
( <i>laughing</i> )

11:37.850 --> 11:41.518
Oh, you're sure going
to get remembered, fella.

11:41.583 --> 11:44.384
Uh, hey... listen,
I owe you some money here.

11:44.451 --> 11:46.284
That's right.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.317
Thanks.

11:55.384 --> 11:56.984
( <i>sighing</i> )

11:57.051 --> 11:58.784
Here, take this.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.151
A hundred dollars?

No, please take it.

12:01.550 --> 12:02.750
Oh, wait, I can't!

12:02.817 --> 12:03.750
Please?

12:03.817 --> 12:05.850
I'd feel like a call girl.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.583
You didn't do anything.

12:07.650 --> 12:09.984
I'd feel like a bad call girl.

12:11.617 --> 12:12.917
I want you
to have it.

12:12.984 --> 12:15.317
I mean, think of it
as a down payment

12:15.384 --> 12:16.650
on your art gallery.

12:16.717 --> 12:17.817
You deserve it.

12:17.884 --> 12:19.917
It's the best cab
ride I ever had.

12:19.984 --> 12:20.917
Oh.

12:20.984 --> 12:22.550
Oh, this is some tip.

12:22.617 --> 12:26.117
What would you have given me
if I'd stayed the night?

12:27.750 --> 12:29.984
A very sweet memory.

12:30.051 --> 12:32.484
LOUIE:
You're better off
with the hundred.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.583
Louie! Oh, Louie..!

12:34.650 --> 12:36.583
Oh, I don't believe it!

12:36.650 --> 12:39.683
Louie, what are
you doing?!

12:39.750 --> 12:41.717
I don't believe it!
Louie, you creep!

12:41.784 --> 12:43.251
You know, this creep
has nothing to do

12:43.317 --> 12:45.051
than to interfere
with other people's lives.

12:45.117 --> 12:46.217
I hate you!

12:46.284 --> 12:47.717
Oh, I am so embarrassed.

12:47.784 --> 12:49.550
I am so sorry.
I had no idea.

12:49.617 --> 12:50.550
I'll kill you!

12:50.617 --> 12:51.950
I'm sorry.

12:52.017 --> 12:53.484
I believe you.

12:54.484 --> 12:55.750
Good night.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.151
Oh, good night.

13:11.884 --> 13:13.484
Good old 804.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.184
Well, he sounds like

13:15.251 --> 13:17.351
he was some kind
of great guy.

13:17.418 --> 13:19.284
No, you did
the right thing.

13:19.351 --> 13:21.284
The guy had to have
a big flaw somewhere.

13:21.351 --> 13:22.617
He did.

13:22.683 --> 13:24.650
He took no for an answer.

13:33.683 --> 13:35.351
It's your turn.

13:35.418 --> 13:37.017
What, for a story?

13:37.084 --> 13:38.351
Oh, come on.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.384
I don't have any good ones.

13:40.451 --> 13:42.984
I mean, it's just
the usual stuff, you know.

13:43.051 --> 13:45.317
Well, one time I had
this contortionist

13:45.384 --> 13:47.451
who insisted
on riding in the trunk.

13:47.518 --> 13:48.750
I had a woman one time

13:48.817 --> 13:51.451
with a head of lettuce
she said was alive,

13:51.518 --> 13:52.650
and she wanted me
to ask it questions.

13:52.717 --> 13:53.784
I mean, you know, usual stuff.

13:53.850 --> 13:56.151
Nothing unusual, huh?

13:56.217 --> 13:59.884
Well, there was this one time
in 804,

13:59.950 --> 14:03.251
but it was
no big deal, actually.

14:03.317 --> 14:06.484
I'll bet you this guy's got
the best story of them all.

14:06.550 --> 14:08.317
You bet.

14:08.384 --> 14:10.451
It helps to get
it off your chest.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.017
Right. It goes like this.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.917
<i>Well, it was a miserable night.</i>

14:13.984 --> 14:17.518
<i>It had just been snowing, and</i>
<i>my bookings were real light,</i>

14:17.583 --> 14:19.051
<i>when I see this guy...</i>

14:19.117 --> 14:20.451
Taxi!

14:22.451 --> 14:23.884
Hi there.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.384
Methodist Hospital.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.583
It's not an emergency,
or anything, is it?

14:27.650 --> 14:30.451
No. We're having a baby,
but no need to panic.

14:30.518 --> 14:31.784
Everything's cool.

14:31.850 --> 14:33.117
Who's we?

14:33.184 --> 14:34.451
Just a minute.

14:34.518 --> 14:36.151
Don't start the meter.

14:39.518 --> 14:40.784
You okay?

14:40.850 --> 14:42.117
Uh-huh.

14:42.184 --> 14:43.451
Okay. Okay.

14:43.518 --> 14:46.917
You were right behind me
on the stairs.

14:46.984 --> 14:49.084
What happened?
What happened?

14:49.151 --> 14:52.217
I lost you when you
started taking two at a time.

14:52.284 --> 14:53.717
Hello.

14:53.784 --> 14:55.217
You can start the meter now.
Don't drive too fast.

14:55.284 --> 14:56.884
We got plenty of time.

14:56.950 --> 14:57.984
Are you sure?

14:58.051 --> 14:58.950
Yeah, we're going natural.

14:59.017 --> 15:00.017
We've had
the Lamaze classes.

15:00.084 --> 15:01.550
We know exactly
what we're doing.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.184
Going natural is so great

15:03.251 --> 15:05.683
because ou know ahead of time
what's going to happen.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.717
You don't have
to worry anyway.

15:07.784 --> 15:12.184
With my pelvis, the doctor says
I'm gonna drop 'em like kittens.

15:12.251 --> 15:13.550
My mother was like that.

15:13.617 --> 15:15.850
Even my grandmother
dropped 'em like kittens.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.650
My great-grandmother...

15:17.717 --> 15:19.518
Dropped 'em
like kittens?

15:19.617 --> 15:21.317
That's enough.
She may be a little nervous.

15:21.384 --> 15:23.284
It's okay, that's why I'm
here to keep her calm.

15:23.351 --> 15:24.750
I made you a great
peanut butter...

15:24.817 --> 15:26.917
Oh, oh. Here comes
another one. Start timing.

15:26.984 --> 15:28.251
Huh?

15:28.317 --> 15:29.683
Start timing her
labor contractions.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.850
The length of the contraction
and how often they occur

15:31.917 --> 15:34.117
lets you know exactly which
stage of the labor she's in.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.284
She's just in
the latter part

15:35.351 --> 15:36.784
of the first phase
of the first stage

15:36.850 --> 15:38.550
because the contractions are
way, way apart,

15:38.617 --> 15:39.583
lasting about 20 seconds.

15:39.650 --> 15:40.750
Later on they'll maybe...

15:40.817 --> 15:42.284
They'll be maybe
three minutes or so apart

15:42.351 --> 15:43.384
and last about 60 seconds.

15:43.451 --> 15:44.984
Ultimately, the last
couple of minutes

15:45.051 --> 15:46.317
will be one
right after the other.

15:46.384 --> 15:48.451
That's the third and final phase
of the first stage.

15:48.518 --> 15:49.750
It's pretty fascinating,
isn't it?

15:49.817 --> 15:51.617
Yeah, I guess so.

15:51.683 --> 15:53.151
I'm her coach.
I give all the directions.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.418
It keeps her mind focused
away from the pain that way.

15:55.484 --> 15:57.151
Coach, huh?
Yeah, that's the name
they give us.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.484
I've got the sack here, bag.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.451
I've got a rolling pin
and tennis ball for back pain

16:00.518 --> 16:01.750
in case she needs a back rub.

16:01.817 --> 16:03.518
I got some candy
in case I get hungry.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.451
I do the breathing too
right along with her.

16:05.518 --> 16:06.351
We share everything.

16:06.418 --> 16:07.484
This way she doesn't feel

16:07.550 --> 16:08.917
like she's having
the baby alone.

16:08.984 --> 16:10.251
Hey, listen,
why don't you relax?

16:10.317 --> 16:11.717
Sit back there
and have some candy.

16:11.784 --> 16:12.884
Oh, no, thanks.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.051
I'm not hungry.
Maybe when I get to the...

16:14.117 --> 16:14.784
Stop.

16:14.850 --> 16:15.583
Me?

16:15.650 --> 16:16.550
She means me.

16:16.617 --> 16:17.850
I stop timing
the contraction.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.084
It's over now. I check to see
how long it lasted--

16:20.151 --> 16:21.217
minute and ten seconds--

16:21.284 --> 16:22.518
make a note of it.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.117
Pencil, pencil... may I?

16:24.184 --> 16:25.251
Oh, sure.

16:26.617 --> 16:27.451
Here.

16:27.518 --> 16:29.384
Huh?
Oh, thanks.

16:29.451 --> 16:31.184
A minute and ten seconds?
In phase one?

16:31.251 --> 16:32.484
Here comes another one.

16:32.550 --> 16:33.484
You just had one.

16:33.550 --> 16:34.817
Well, I'm having another one.

16:34.884 --> 16:36.884
That's phase three. What
happened to phase two? Stop.

16:36.950 --> 16:38.351
I can't.
Not you, him!
Stop the cab!

16:38.418 --> 16:39.518
What for?

16:39.583 --> 16:40.683
We skipped phase two,
we're too late.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.017
<i>We're</i> too late?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.850
Oh, my gosh. She's having
the baby right here.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.984
She's still contracting.
This is it, this is the baby.

16:46.051 --> 16:48.384
Hey, hey, listen, I thought you
were supposed to stay calm?

16:48.451 --> 16:50.217
I thought we were supposed
to have three phases,

16:50.284 --> 16:51.484
and look,
she's still contracting.

16:51.550 --> 16:52.717
This is it,
this is the baby.

16:52.784 --> 16:53.984
All right, now, try
to stay calm now.

16:54.051 --> 16:55.051
You want me to
get a doctor?

16:55.117 --> 16:56.351
No, don't talk to me,
I feel sick.

16:56.418 --> 16:58.351
What?!
Faint. I feel faint.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.617
Do your breathing.

16:59.683 --> 17:00.950
I can't.
I feel nauseous.

17:01.017 --> 17:03.017
Help him, please!
Get him in the front seat.

17:03.084 --> 17:04.518
Well, what
about you?!

17:04.583 --> 17:07.084
I'm sorry, I feel...
I got to get air.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.916
Here comes another one.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.750
Keep... Breathe, breathe.

17:12.817 --> 17:14.351
Where did he go?
Hey, mister!

17:14.417 --> 17:16.317
Please, lady,
look give me a break.

17:16.384 --> 17:17.583
( <i>screaming</i> )

17:17.650 --> 17:18.817
Hey, what about her?

17:18.884 --> 17:19.950
You'll have to take over.

17:20.017 --> 17:21.284
Me?!

17:21.351 --> 17:23.417
Listen, no sweat. I can
coach you from here

17:23.483 --> 17:25.451
on how to coach her
back there.

17:25.518 --> 17:26.950
Hey, come on!
No kidding around.

17:27.017 --> 17:29.317
You've got to go
through with this.

17:29.384 --> 17:31.051
Hey, come on, come on.
Shape up, fella, will you?

17:32.351 --> 17:34.017
This happens to some men.

17:34.084 --> 17:35.617
Please don't blame him for it.

17:35.683 --> 17:37.550
Don't make him
feel inferior.

17:37.617 --> 17:38.683
Listen, lady, I'm a stranger.

17:38.750 --> 17:39.850
You don't want me.
You want him.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.484
She was the star pupil
in her class.

17:41.550 --> 17:43.084
She'll take coaching
from anybody.

17:43.151 --> 17:44.884
Hey, where are you going?!
Come here!

17:44.950 --> 17:45.884
What are you doing?

17:45.950 --> 17:47.017
( <i>breathing quickly</i> )

17:47.084 --> 17:48.750
Here, watch me-- like this.

17:52.717 --> 17:54.017
Coach her, coach her,
don't let her coach you.

17:54.084 --> 17:55.683
He's right, he's right.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.084
Don't worry
about how I am.

17:57.151 --> 17:58.451
Make sure
she follows you.

17:58.518 --> 17:59.817
Make sure she
follows you.

17:59.884 --> 18:02.484
You're the boss,
remember.

18:02.550 --> 18:05.617
Have you got something
to catch the baby?

18:05.683 --> 18:07.151
Huh?

18:07.217 --> 18:08.617
Use your coat.

18:08.683 --> 18:10.284
Make sure
she's relaxed.

18:10.351 --> 18:12.384
Don't let her muscles
tense up.

18:12.451 --> 18:13.817
Hold her hand.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.251
You can't hold my hand,
I need my hand.

18:15.317 --> 18:16.518
I can't hold her hand,
she needs her hand.

18:16.583 --> 18:17.550
Forget her hand.

18:17.617 --> 18:19.550
Hey! What are you doing?

18:19.617 --> 18:21.384
Getting into position.

18:21.451 --> 18:23.317
It's coming.
I can feel it.

18:23.384 --> 18:25.650
Make sure she's at
a 45-degree angle.

18:25.717 --> 18:27.151
To what?! To what?!

18:27.217 --> 18:28.550
Are you pushing yet?

18:28.617 --> 18:30.251
I didn't know
I was supposed to push.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.351
I'm not talking to you.

18:31.418 --> 18:32.583
Oh.
Push. Are you pushing?

18:32.650 --> 18:36.117
( <i>straining</i> ):
I'm pushing!

18:36.184 --> 18:37.418
What's he doing?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.418
He's doing fine.

18:41.418 --> 18:43.217
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

18:43.284 --> 18:44.984
Isn't she concentrating?

18:45.051 --> 18:46.351
How should I know?

18:46.418 --> 18:47.850
Why don't you call a doctor.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.850
Use the radio, will you?

18:49.917 --> 18:51.351
Are you all right?

18:51.418 --> 18:52.817
All right, I got it.

18:52.884 --> 18:54.750
Here, you talk.
Oh, my God.

18:54.817 --> 18:57.451
Louie! Alex. Cab 804.

18:57.518 --> 18:58.950
Listen, you got trouble here.

18:59.017 --> 19:00.451
A lady's having a baby.

19:00.518 --> 19:01.884
LOUIE:
I never saw her before.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.384
No, Louie, Louie! Louie!

19:03.451 --> 19:05.384
We're on 61st Street between
Second and Third Avenues.

19:05.451 --> 19:07.451
Get a doctor quick,
will you, please?

19:07.518 --> 19:08.784
It's coming.

19:08.850 --> 19:10.284
Oh, my God.

19:10.351 --> 19:11.617
Keep breathing!
Keep pushing!

19:11.683 --> 19:12.784
Push.

19:14.217 --> 19:15.850
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.117
Just take it easy.
Just relax.

19:17.184 --> 19:19.518
Allen, watch. It's coming.

19:19.583 --> 19:20.850
I can feel it.

19:20.917 --> 19:21.850
I can't.

19:21.917 --> 19:22.850
Huh?

19:22.917 --> 19:24.817
Allen! Look!

19:24.884 --> 19:25.817
I can't look.

19:25.884 --> 19:27.817
I'm going to remember this.

19:27.884 --> 19:30.583
You let a stranger
deliver our baby.

19:30.650 --> 19:33.151
I'll never marry you now.

19:33.217 --> 19:34.251
Ruth, don't...

19:37.418 --> 19:38.750
Ruth, please, don't be mad.

19:38.817 --> 19:40.117
I can't help it.

19:40.184 --> 19:41.950
Yeah, come on, Ruth,
this is no time to argue.

19:42.017 --> 19:43.451
Marry him
if he wants to marry you.

19:43.518 --> 19:46.984
Marry a man who won't even
look at our baby?

19:47.051 --> 19:49.151
All right, all right. I'll look.

19:49.217 --> 19:50.750
But what if I pass out?

19:53.117 --> 19:55.017
Oh, God.

19:55.084 --> 19:56.617
Look at that.

19:56.683 --> 19:58.484
ALEX:
Now, take it easy.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.051
I got it.

20:01.151 --> 20:03.484
Watch the shoulders, now.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.051
Careful.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.451
Ruth, it's so beautiful.

20:10.518 --> 20:12.084
Easy now.

20:12.151 --> 20:14.151
Easy.
You're almost home free.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.151
Ruth, it's a boy.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.151
It's a boy.

20:23.217 --> 20:24.650
Yeah. A boy.

20:24.717 --> 20:26.217
( <i>baby crying</i> )

20:26.284 --> 20:30.051
Wrap him up.

20:30.117 --> 20:32.217
Don't cut
the umbilical cord.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.217
Lay him on top of Ruth.

20:34.284 --> 20:35.917
He'll stay warm there.

20:49.251 --> 20:52.451
Allen, look.

20:55.418 --> 20:57.051
Hey... I'm a father.

20:59.184 --> 21:02.750
Ruth, I love you.

21:02.817 --> 21:06.884
I love you too.

21:06.950 --> 21:10.017
Hey, Congratulations.

21:10.084 --> 21:13.184
Hey, Mister, really...

21:13.251 --> 21:14.950
I don't know how
to thank you

21:15.017 --> 21:16.384
for all this.
Aw...

21:16.451 --> 21:18.351
We don't have a name
for him yet. What's your name?

21:18.418 --> 21:19.884
Alex.

21:19.950 --> 21:23.051
Maybe we'll just get you
a bottle of scotch.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.550
Hi.

21:35.617 --> 21:36.683
Hey, Bob,
what's happening?

21:36.750 --> 21:37.683
Any word on 804 yet?

21:37.750 --> 21:38.850
They took it upstairs.

21:38.917 --> 21:40.317
They're still going
to work on it.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.717
Well... Latka!

21:43.784 --> 21:45.550
Just tell me.

21:45.617 --> 21:47.418
How's it going?

21:47.484 --> 21:49.583
Yeah, how's
the car, man?

21:49.650 --> 21:51.151
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:51.217 --> 21:56.950
I now present to you
cab 804.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.217
ALEX:
Latka!

22:02.284 --> 22:04.683
The man's a genius,
a genius.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.351
Thank you very much.

22:07.418 --> 22:10.317
Hey, can I be
the first to drive it?

22:10.384 --> 22:12.284
Hey, wait a minute! I want
to be the first to drive it.

22:12.351 --> 22:13.518
I saved a guy's life
in this car.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.317
Hey, I saved my own
life in this car!

22:15.384 --> 22:16.917
I met my dream man
in this car.

22:16.984 --> 22:18.518
Now, hold it, hold it.
Now just hold it!

22:18.583 --> 22:22.550
I know you all have good reasons
to want this car,

22:22.617 --> 22:24.583
but I think I got you all beat.

22:26.251 --> 22:28.617
I brought
a beautiful human being

22:28.683 --> 22:30.683
into the world in this cab.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.217
When a man is right,

22:33.284 --> 22:36.017
a man is right.

22:37.151 --> 22:38.884
Well, thank you, Louie.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.017
Thanks.

22:45.084 --> 22:46.351
Oh, Alex?

22:46.418 --> 22:47.850
Yes, Latka?

22:47.917 --> 22:49.384
One thing--

22:49.451 --> 22:51.884
Be careful of steering.

22:51.950 --> 22:55.251
You know, sometimes
you turn... go this way

22:55.317 --> 22:57.717
when the car,
it go this way.

22:57.784 --> 22:59.184
Okay.

22:59.251 --> 23:00.850
Oh, and also...

23:00.917 --> 23:02.550
Yes?

23:02.617 --> 23:04.650
Brakes are
really good now

23:04.717 --> 23:07.451
except when it's wet
or very dry.

23:09.084 --> 23:10.518
Leave it to me.

23:10.583 --> 23:11.917
Okay.

23:13.317 --> 23:16.217
Oh, and one...
also, Alex.

23:16.284 --> 23:21.317
Be sure don't go over
25 mile per hours

23:21.384 --> 23:25.550
because if you do,
transmission...

23:25.617 --> 23:28.051
Don't worry
about it, Latka.

23:28.117 --> 23:29.717
Okay. See you later.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.217
Okay.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.750
See you, Alex.

23:32.817 --> 23:37.084
( <i>engine sputters</i>
<i>and backfires</i> )

23:42.418 --> 23:43.784
Hey, Alex!

23:43.850 --> 23:45.284
TONY:
It's burning!

23:45.351 --> 23:46.484
JOHN:
Turn it off!

23:46.550 --> 23:47.784
BOBBY:
Alex!

23:53.117 --> 23:56.351
On reflection, I think
I delivered that baby in 803.

23:56.418 --> 23:58.984
Hey, guys.

23:59.051 --> 24:01.351
I think I made a mistake.
It wasn't this cab at all.

24:06.451 --> 24:09.284

24:33.451 --> 24:34.984

Night, Mr. Walters.
