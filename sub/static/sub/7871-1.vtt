01:26.723 --> 01:30.092
This is Kent Brockman at the 1st
Annual Springfield Grand Prix,

01:30.127 --> 01:31.894
which, like all our
town showcase events,

01:31.929 --> 01:35.431
is not only poorly planned,
it's horribly executed.

01:40.654 --> 01:42.755
<i>The Making of the Empire</i>
<i>State Building,</i>

01:42.789 --> 01:45.057
<i>Part One: The Basement.</i>

01:58.472 --> 01:59.639
Aw!

02:01.475 --> 02:02.825
Wait for the gap...

02:02.859 --> 02:04.377
Wait for the gap.

02:04.411 --> 02:07.063
Homer, we can buy
Scotch tape tomorrow.

02:07.097 --> 02:08.347
There's the gap!

02:09.765 --> 02:10.900
Gap's too small!

02:11.818 --> 02:13.936
Huh?

02:13.971 --> 02:15.354
A <i>peloton?</i>

02:15.389 --> 02:17.390
Apparently, today is
also the final stage

02:17.424 --> 02:19.392
of the Tour De Springfield
bike race.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.629
Hey, that's some
fancy riding.

02:32.673 --> 02:36.125
Truthfully, today, there were
no losers and no winners

02:36.159 --> 02:39.929
since both finish lines were
tangled up in this unholy mess.

02:41.081 --> 02:42.548
I hear tapping from inside.

02:42.582 --> 02:44.150
What's goin' on?

02:44.184 --> 02:48.237
Well, uh, let's, uh,
all start tapping our toes

02:48.271 --> 02:52.375
to the sounds of Scab Calloway
and his non-union band.

02:53.443 --> 02:55.111
Uh, keep it down in there.

02:59.616 --> 03:03.786
So, is this a "date" date or
just a meaningless friend thing?

03:03.820 --> 03:06.038
Meaningless friend thing.
True love super date!

03:06.073 --> 03:08.607
Well, if you two ever get
serious and have a baby,

03:08.642 --> 03:10.659
it'll look
something like this.

03:14.264 --> 03:15.798
Don't listen to Uncle Bart.

03:15.832 --> 03:18.918
Lisa and I will raise
you in a house of love.

03:18.952 --> 03:21.087
We're not having a baby.

03:21.121 --> 03:22.471
Jimmy!

03:22.506 --> 03:23.472
Oh, brother.

03:23.507 --> 03:24.573
Let's dance.

03:28.829 --> 03:30.112
Geek leak!

03:32.315 --> 03:36.252
Hey, Bart, at least
I've got a date.

03:36.286 --> 03:37.920
Dance with me, please.

03:37.954 --> 03:39.221
I need to zing my sister.

03:39.256 --> 03:41.723
Okay, but you have
to do your homework.

03:41.742 --> 03:42.724
Just kidding.

03:42.743 --> 03:44.059
I've given up on that.

03:44.077 --> 03:46.946
Just move
your girdle, Yertle.

03:46.997 --> 03:48.581
Hey, Lise, your dance partner

03:48.615 --> 03:51.667
just made the cover
<i>Dorks Illustrated</i> magazine.

03:51.701 --> 03:54.253
I know that's a zing,
but still...

03:54.287 --> 03:55.438
the cover!

03:55.472 --> 03:56.956
Now, you listen
to me, Bart.

03:57.007 --> 03:59.291
Milhouse may not
be the perfect date.

03:59.342 --> 04:01.743
Please let there be a "but"
coming, please!

04:01.762 --> 04:03.462
But...
Landed it!

04:05.065 --> 04:07.967
At least I'm with someone
who tries a little too hard

04:08.001 --> 04:09.869
because he really likes me.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.972
Hey, plenty of babes have docked
in Porta de Barto.

04:13.023 --> 04:14.990
Yeah, for about a week.

04:15.025 --> 04:16.659
But as soon as they
get to know the real you,

04:16.692 --> 04:18.928
they departo de Barto.

04:18.962 --> 04:20.312
That's why you're
alone tonight.

04:22.065 --> 04:25.034
Oh my God, is that true?

04:25.068 --> 04:27.102
Yeah, I'm afraid
Lisa's right, son.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.456
If the late, great Nora Ephron
taught us anything, it's...

04:30.490 --> 04:33.042
Oh! What's my other
inflatable doll doing here?

04:36.129 --> 04:37.129
What? What?

04:37.164 --> 04:39.682
I ain't here with no one.

04:48.358 --> 04:50.326
Oh, man, Lisa's right.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.595
None of these relationships
lasted very long.

04:52.629 --> 04:53.796
Three days.

04:53.830 --> 04:54.930
One recess.

04:54.965 --> 04:56.565
Half a field trip.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.101
Why did I have to get so needy
at the planetarium?

04:59.136 --> 05:02.204
Boy, if anyone needs me,
I'll be taking a popcorn bath.

05:02.239 --> 05:04.473
It's a thing I read about in
a <i>Men's Health</i> magazine

05:04.508 --> 05:05.674
in a dream.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.643
Dad, can I ask
you a question?

05:07.677 --> 05:10.613
How did you ever get a woman
like Mom to stay with you?

05:10.647 --> 05:13.182
Look in the mirror,
unplanned miracle.

05:13.216 --> 05:14.717
Is that the only reason?

05:14.751 --> 05:17.520
Well, I also keep
things interesting.

05:17.554 --> 05:19.622
All right,
who took the microwave?

05:19.656 --> 05:21.056
You see?

05:21.091 --> 05:22.992
Hey, what are you looking at?

05:23.026 --> 05:24.460
My ex-girlfriends.

05:24.494 --> 05:26.362
Aw, boy, I feel for you.

05:26.396 --> 05:27.830
Nobody likes to be rejected

05:27.864 --> 05:30.733
and it never gets easier,
until you can drink.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.835
Because then you can express
your unfiltered feelings

05:32.869 --> 05:34.904
by drunk dialing.

05:34.938 --> 05:35.971
Observe.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.139
Hey, it's me again.

05:37.174 --> 05:39.341
He's there, isn't he?

05:39.376 --> 05:41.143
Well, I hope this
doesn't sound weird,

05:41.178 --> 05:43.145
but I'm inside your closet.

05:43.179 --> 05:46.665
Um, that's awesome, but I think
I'll visit my ex-girlfriends

05:46.700 --> 05:48.701
and prove they still like me.

05:51.037 --> 05:52.004
Hey.

05:52.038 --> 05:53.455
It's me.

05:53.490 --> 05:55.174
I was thinking about you.

05:55.208 --> 05:58.460
It's your birthday in like,
three, four months?

05:58.495 --> 06:01.497
Would it be weird
if I threw you a party?

06:03.333 --> 06:05.518
Eat my shorts!

06:05.552 --> 06:06.752
Drop dead.

06:06.786 --> 06:09.838
Eat fist, jerk.

06:09.873 --> 06:12.708
You've got a lot of nerve
showing up here...

06:12.742 --> 06:15.077
and not giving
me a kiss.

06:15.111 --> 06:16.712
Inappropriate!

06:16.746 --> 06:18.013
I miss you.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.615
Stalker!

06:19.649 --> 06:21.500
Save me.

06:24.237 --> 06:25.888
Mary Spuckler,

06:25.922 --> 06:27.556
you're my last chance.

06:27.574 --> 06:30.359
She's pretty cute
for Cletus's daughter.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.945
Yeah, she liked to drink milk
as a kid instead of white paint.

06:34.881 --> 06:36.682
Is you one of my kids?

06:36.716 --> 06:37.850
No, sir.

06:37.884 --> 06:38.884
Prove it.

06:38.919 --> 06:39.919
A, B, C...

06:39.953 --> 06:41.186
All right.
All right.

06:41.221 --> 06:42.888
You convinced me, Einstein.

06:42.923 --> 06:43.889
What you want?

06:43.924 --> 06:45.190
Is Mary here?

06:45.225 --> 06:47.393
I'm afraid Mary
done run off.

06:47.427 --> 06:49.361
We knows not where.

06:49.396 --> 06:50.396
Dadgummit.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.964
Do you think she still likes me?

06:51.998 --> 06:54.133
Um, hey, Brandine!

06:54.167 --> 06:56.435
Does Mary still
like this boy?

06:56.469 --> 06:59.305
I don't know what
that girl likes anymore.

06:59.339 --> 07:02.575
She ran away after we engaged
her to Old Man Wellbottom.

07:02.609 --> 07:04.743
And I was gonna be
a good husband, too!

07:04.778 --> 07:06.979
If'n I ever get
out of this well.

07:07.013 --> 07:08.881
All right.
All right now.

07:08.915 --> 07:10.215
That's enough
out of you.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.550
But I just--

07:12.652 --> 07:15.454
Oh, I can't believe
she ran away.

07:15.488 --> 07:17.072
And this isn't helping.

07:17.107 --> 07:18.741
I better switch
to the hard stuff.

07:18.775 --> 07:19.942
Hey, Dubya.

07:19.976 --> 07:22.344
I know where
my sister run off to.

07:22.379 --> 07:24.113
New York City.

07:24.147 --> 07:25.347
New York?

07:25.382 --> 07:27.316
That's where
Sesame Street is.

07:27.350 --> 07:30.653
Do you ever wonder what happens
to Oscar on garbage day?

07:30.687 --> 07:32.855
Yup, New York.

07:32.889 --> 07:34.456
The big something.

07:34.491 --> 07:36.025
This here's her address.

07:36.059 --> 07:37.109
Good luck!

07:44.270 --> 07:47.005
I don't know if we
should be up here, Bart Simpson.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.840
And why is that?

07:50.376 --> 07:52.176
'Cause the floor ain't finished.

07:52.194 --> 07:55.430
Daddy just covers things with
hay and says they're done.

07:58.551 --> 08:01.786
Mom, can we go to New York to
find this girl I used to know?

08:01.820 --> 08:03.371
Bart, that's sweet,

08:03.405 --> 08:06.574
but we'd need
airplane money, hotel money...

08:06.609 --> 08:09.677
And $500 for Yankee tickets,
which turn out to be bogus.

08:09.712 --> 08:11.179
Well, don't buy 'em.

08:11.213 --> 08:13.181
But they're playing
the Purple Sox.

08:13.215 --> 08:15.500
Come on, Dad,
you love New York.

08:15.534 --> 08:17.418
Now, that your two least
favorite buildings

08:17.469 --> 08:20.038
Old Penn
Station and Shea Stadium.

08:20.072 --> 08:21.856
Lousy, outdated relics!

08:21.891 --> 08:24.225
Boy, do you remember
what happened

08:24.260 --> 08:26.544
the last time
we went to New York?

08:31.216 --> 08:33.384
Keep your meat hooks off
my sister Marge or my goons

08:33.402 --> 08:35.186
will do a soft show
on your solar plexus.

08:35.220 --> 08:37.337
You're dead, J.J.
Get yourself buried.

08:37.373 --> 08:39.340
Tough cookie, huh, well, watch
me take a bite out of ya.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.476
I'm about to go out shooting
and you just said who.

08:41.510 --> 08:42.809
That's some lip
you got on you.

08:42.845 --> 08:44.078
How'd you like me to stretch it
like a rubber band

08:44.113 --> 08:45.480
and snap you into last week?

08:45.514 --> 08:48.800
You're selling milk, J.J.,
and I got a sour stomach.

08:50.686 --> 08:54.188
Homer, that sounds like
<i>The Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

08:54.223 --> 08:56.124
It didn't
feel like success.

09:00.613 --> 09:03.331
Why, ladies? Why?!

09:03.365 --> 09:06.267
Son, you can
dial down the crazy.

09:06.302 --> 09:07.885
Your mother and I talked
about it,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.554
and we found a way
to get to New York.

09:09.588 --> 09:11.389
It's all set, boy.

09:11.423 --> 09:14.292
To save money,
we're swapping houses.

09:14.326 --> 09:16.928
But don't the people wreck your
house when they stay in it?

09:16.962 --> 09:18.930
I didn't say
I swapped <i>our</i> house.

09:20.532 --> 09:21.733
Yeah, how ya doing?

09:21.767 --> 09:23.167
We're staying here
for two weeks.

09:23.202 --> 09:24.969
Lord, you're testing me,
aren't you?

09:25.004 --> 09:26.371
Yeah, keep talking
to your friend up there.

09:26.405 --> 09:27.639
We'll be doing it
on your bed.

09:27.673 --> 09:29.824
New York style.

09:41.754 --> 09:43.338
Look at this place.

09:43.389 --> 09:44.522
Things have certainly changed

09:44.556 --> 09:47.091
since our ancestor
Fievel came here.

09:47.126 --> 09:48.893
Fievel was a mouse
in a movie.

09:48.927 --> 09:51.262
Yes, and now look at us.

09:51.296 --> 09:52.497
Only in America.

09:52.531 --> 09:55.133
Khlav Kalash!
Get your Khlav Kalash!

09:55.167 --> 09:59.137
Oh, geez, not this guy with
his stupid little pushcart.

09:59.139 --> 10:01.839
50,000 square feet, huh?
All Khlav Kalash!

10:01.874 --> 10:03.107
Used to be bookstore.

10:04.209 --> 10:05.176
Books.

10:05.210 --> 10:07.011
Come on,
let's go find Mary.

10:07.046 --> 10:08.813
This is the address
her brother gave me.

10:08.847 --> 10:11.149
Can't Dad take Bart while
we seek out culture?

10:11.183 --> 10:12.917
You do that.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.620
You know you're
missing your clothes?

10:15.654 --> 10:17.188
I thought this was
just a dream.

10:17.190 --> 10:19.123
, man!

10:27.966 --> 10:29.600
All right, I'll spring
for a cab.

10:29.635 --> 10:32.670
Much better.

10:32.705 --> 10:34.171
Here we are.

10:34.189 --> 10:36.574
Anything you leave in a cab
you'll never see again.

10:41.313 --> 10:42.480
Hey!

10:42.514 --> 10:45.299
Oh, uh, oh, thank God
you woke up.

10:51.073 --> 10:53.941
Oh, I guess my search
for true love is doomed.

10:53.976 --> 10:56.611
You've learned a very
valuable life lesson, boy.

10:56.645 --> 10:58.546
Which is that love
doesn't exist,

10:58.580 --> 11:02.350
except briefly between a man
and a woman before marriage.

11:02.384 --> 11:05.319
After that, it's just hanging
out with someone who kind of

11:05.354 --> 11:08.356
hates you but you can't get it
together to leave.

11:08.390 --> 11:10.858
I'll get us some ice cream.

11:13.362 --> 11:15.096
What's the matter, darling?

11:15.147 --> 11:17.081
Thanks for asking, Duchess.

11:17.116 --> 11:20.068
I'm sitting here waiting for a
girl that's never gonna show up.

11:20.102 --> 11:21.069
What makes you so sure?

11:21.103 --> 11:22.804
Girls don't like me.

11:22.838 --> 11:25.306
I don't really like them yet
either, but I think I'm gonna.

11:25.340 --> 11:27.208
There's a storm
a-brewing down there.

11:27.242 --> 11:29.644
Well, there's a girl
a-standin' right here.

11:29.678 --> 11:31.179
It's me, Mary.

11:31.213 --> 11:33.848
Wow, what are you
doing for money?

11:33.882 --> 11:37.385
Well, it's not very steady
and I'm kind of ashamed.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.587
I'm a featured player on
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

11:39.621 --> 11:42.256
<i>Mary Spuckler!</i>

11:42.291 --> 11:44.058
Aw, I'm lying.

11:44.093 --> 11:46.094
My whole life here
is a bunch of lies.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.362
I'm just a writer
with a performing option.

11:48.397 --> 11:50.865
Let's talk about something else.

11:50.899 --> 11:52.900
Something nice.

11:55.404 --> 11:58.372
So, this is basically
what we can afford.

11:58.407 --> 12:01.375
Okay, second balcony, partially
obstructed view,

12:01.410 --> 12:03.444
no bathroom privileges
and you must stipulate that,

12:03.479 --> 12:05.880
in emergencies, you can
change a spotlight shell.

12:05.914 --> 12:08.883
Well, at least I'll be able to
say I went to a Broadway show.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.284
You're not allowed
to say that.

12:10.319 --> 12:12.120
Oh, forget it.

12:12.154 --> 12:14.021
So, Bart Simpson,
did you really come

12:14.056 --> 12:17.525
all the way here
just to see me?

12:17.559 --> 12:18.526
Yeah.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.927
Plus, I thought I might get

12:19.962 --> 12:21.329
to see an air conditioner
fall on someone's head.

12:21.363 --> 12:22.530
But I guess that
never really...

12:22.564 --> 12:23.898
D'oh!

12:23.932 --> 12:25.800
Ow! What was that?!
Is that your father?

12:25.834 --> 12:27.485
Bart, I want to see you again,

12:27.519 --> 12:29.887
but I don't want a grownup
taking me back.

12:29.922 --> 12:32.273
Meet me at the high line
tomorrow.

12:32.307 --> 12:34.225
Keep my secret!

12:34.259 --> 12:35.426
You little!

12:35.460 --> 12:37.979
Where's that ice cream?!

12:38.013 --> 12:39.981
Just once, I'd like your father

12:40.015 --> 12:42.183
to be on a jumbotron
for something good.

12:42.217 --> 12:44.051
Damn you
and your fluted neck!

12:48.210 --> 12:50.044
So, what did you do
with your dad?

12:50.079 --> 12:52.163
We're safe because you have
to climb steps to get up here.

12:54.366 --> 12:55.400
Can't move?

12:55.434 --> 12:58.570
No.

12:58.604 --> 13:01.489
I thought there was no crime
in New York anymore.

13:01.524 --> 13:03.591
Giuliani!

13:03.626 --> 13:05.827
Gimme some news
of Springfield.

13:05.861 --> 13:07.595
They let Sideshow Bob out
of prison again.

13:09.265 --> 13:11.833
Huh, didn't know they
still ran those trains.

13:11.867 --> 13:13.601
How's your momma
and your sister?

13:13.636 --> 13:15.770
Trying to find high culture
at low prices.

13:15.805 --> 13:17.505
No, Lisa!

13:17.540 --> 13:20.575
If you click that turnstile,
it'll blow our budget!

13:20.609 --> 13:22.343
Aah!
Whaah!

13:22.378 --> 13:24.712
Well, without them around,

13:24.747 --> 13:27.215
you and I can walk through
the city holding hands,

13:27.249 --> 13:28.683
just like the menfolk do.

13:28.717 --> 13:30.718
I could listen
to your twang all day.

13:30.753 --> 13:32.520
Would you care
to hear it in song?

13:32.555 --> 13:34.088
'Cause I wrote one 'bout you.

13:34.123 --> 13:35.690
Can I do a rap
in the middle of it?

13:35.724 --> 13:38.526
Or you could just listen.

13:38.561 --> 13:40.762
Sir, may I borrow
your guitar?

13:40.796 --> 13:42.797
Sure, sure. It's the case
that makes money.

I really like you,

14:40.139 --> 14:41.422
I've come
to take you back, Mary.

14:41.457 --> 14:43.458
Daddy?

14:43.492 --> 14:47.795
Sorry, honey, your mother misses
you but she just can't say it.

14:47.830 --> 14:50.365
That's 'cause the donkey
busted her jaw.

14:50.399 --> 14:51.532
She'll be fine.

14:51.567 --> 14:52.867
Your mother too.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.171
All right,
Broadway's too expensive,

14:58.190 --> 14:59.523
the museums are over-curated,

14:59.558 --> 15:01.358
But Shakespeare in the Park
is tonight

15:01.393 --> 15:02.693
and the tickets are free.

15:16.508 --> 15:20.094
Get your cuckold's horns,
neck ruffles, Yorik skulls!

15:20.128 --> 15:22.046
I'll take
a cuckold's horn!

15:25.951 --> 15:27.384
It works!

15:27.419 --> 15:29.720
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

15:29.754 --> 15:33.373
Lad-ies and gen-tle-men,
I have an an-nounce-ment--

15:33.391 --> 15:35.993
That's not iambic pentameter!

15:36.027 --> 15:38.262
I'm afraid that tonight's
show has been cancelled.

15:38.296 --> 15:40.097
Huh? Why?
Wherefore?

15:40.131 --> 15:43.200
The Baldwin brothers, who were,
uh, playing the Monague family

15:43.235 --> 15:44.451
and the Sheen/Estevez clan,

15:44.486 --> 15:46.270
our Capulets, have quit
the production.

15:46.304 --> 15:48.873
You guys suck at acting and you
ate all the potato salad.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.625
No, you suck at acting and
it's first come, first serve!

15:51.660 --> 15:53.060
I made that potato salad!

15:53.094 --> 15:55.729
Well, uh, idiot, it says
Zaybar's on the package!

15:55.764 --> 15:57.298
He works at Zaybar's.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.866
We all work at Zaybar's.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.601
I'm so sorry.

16:00.635 --> 16:03.137
You came to see <i>Romeo and</i>
<i>Juliet,</i> not feuding families.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.206
Uh, the long, slow line to leave
the theatre forms on the left.

16:07.642 --> 16:10.611
Aw, and we have to
walk by a drum circle!

16:12.013 --> 16:14.198
Faster, man!
More annoying!

16:14.232 --> 16:16.083
Not so fast!

16:16.117 --> 16:18.953
We came for Shakespeare and
we're gonna see Shakespeare.

16:18.987 --> 16:20.754
Anyone who wants
to be in this,

16:20.789 --> 16:22.806
grab a doublet
and meet me backstage!

16:22.857 --> 16:25.643
Is there, mayhaps, a bit
of business for me?

16:25.677 --> 16:27.745
I was thinking amateurs only.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.814
Well, my only
professional job was playing

16:30.849 --> 16:33.601
a nefarious hot dog
in an ad for Taco Bueno.

16:33.635 --> 16:35.469
You fresh-made tacos will never

16:35.503 --> 16:38.772
defeat pre-boiled hot dogs!

16:40.008 --> 16:43.243
Please, I owe
Yale Drama School $200,000.

16:43.278 --> 16:44.378
They keep calling my mother.

16:44.412 --> 16:45.930
Fine! You're in.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.866
I must warn you, I have
crippling stage fright.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.235
Oh, for the love of God!

16:54.606 --> 16:57.141
For never was
a story of more woe

16:57.175 --> 17:00.244
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

17:01.546 --> 17:04.248
Our search for culture
is thus concluded,

17:04.281 --> 17:07.001
For the Bard of Avon
is well suited

17:07.035 --> 17:10.104
to a crowd
with every cell phone muted.

17:10.137 --> 17:12.539
Geez, I can't stop
talking like this.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.040
Hey, don't ever stop!

17:14.075 --> 17:16.676
Because, tonight,
we made it in New York.

17:16.711 --> 17:18.646
Those the people who
took over the theatre?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.982
Pepper spray and power wash--
the New York hug and kiss.

17:29.207 --> 17:31.041
Now, Mary, you listen to me.

17:31.076 --> 17:33.644
I'm one-third your father and
you're gonna come back.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.145
If y'all will excuse me,

17:35.180 --> 17:37.715
I gotta freshen up
for the ride home.

17:37.749 --> 17:41.952
Enjoy your fancy-schmancy
in-house for the last time.

17:43.655 --> 17:45.122
Psst!

17:45.156 --> 17:46.557
Um, I've got to go.

17:46.591 --> 17:47.791
Go where?

17:47.826 --> 17:49.293
Uh, well,
since we're here,

17:49.327 --> 17:51.795
I'm gonna go try to get
Al Roker's autograph.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.297
Here you go, little fan.

17:53.331 --> 17:54.798
Killer storm on the way.

17:54.833 --> 17:58.902
Um, I gonna go try to sell this.

17:58.937 --> 18:00.137
I'll buy it back.

18:04.409 --> 18:06.210
Goodbye, Bart,
and don't worry,

18:06.244 --> 18:08.045
there'll be other
Mary Spucklers,

18:08.079 --> 18:12.816
including my sisters Mary Zeke
and Mary Not Quite Right.

18:12.851 --> 18:14.251
Aw!

18:20.508 --> 18:23.444
Bart, if any girl tries
to fix you, let 'em,

18:23.478 --> 18:25.646
because you got a couple
of big problems.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.981
But mostly, you're great!

18:32.103 --> 18:33.604
Boy, you tell me
where Mary's gone!

18:33.638 --> 18:35.239
I can't.

18:35.273 --> 18:39.209
Boy, you squeal like a piggy
for the hillbilly man.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.644
I can't because
Mary's the girl

18:40.678 --> 18:42.312
that proves that girls
can like me.

18:42.347 --> 18:44.615
And she wouldn't like me
anymore if I gave her up.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.316
So I won't,
even if you torture me

18:46.351 --> 18:47.901
like you do
the English language.

18:47.936 --> 18:50.571
Well, if that ain't
aren't the isn't.

18:50.605 --> 18:54.942
I guess I just gotta
let Mary find her own way.

18:54.976 --> 18:57.828
Come on, let's head on back
to Springfield.

18:57.862 --> 19:01.665
Uh, one on-getter for the
clickity clack, please.

19:06.921 --> 19:09.690
You miss her,
don't you, son?

19:09.724 --> 19:12.526
You want a picture of her
for your wallet?

19:12.560 --> 19:16.029
Oh, she's somewhere
in B-3.

19:16.064 --> 19:18.098
Thanks, man.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.967
Aw, look at that.

19:20.001 --> 19:22.469
My little guy's
finally realizing

19:22.504 --> 19:25.572
how complicated grownup
feelings can be.

19:25.607 --> 19:28.776
Well, at least it didn't end
as bad as <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

19:28.810 --> 19:29.810
No kidding.

19:29.844 --> 19:31.445
I saw your reviews.

19:31.479 --> 19:33.113
Hey!

19:33.131 --> 19:34.948
I specifically said,
no critics!

19:34.983 --> 19:36.783
This is outrageous!

19:36.801 --> 19:39.369
Ooh, but they like <i>.</i>

19:39.404 --> 19:43.404
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

19:46.661 --> 19:48.294
I hope you enjoyed
the show tonight.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.463
And if you're worried about
when the air conditioner

19:50.481 --> 19:53.600
fell on my head,
rest assured it was a stunt man,

19:53.634 --> 19:56.620
and his family is being
well taken care of.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.523
But we're here to ask if you
have an idea for a couch gag.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.443
The best submission will be
animated and appear on the show.

20:03.477 --> 20:05.595
Do we screw them
on the credit?

20:05.630 --> 20:09.933
No! For details,
log on to TheSimpsons.com.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.584
I'm submitting mine now.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.913
