00:00.623 --> 00:02.924
My first kiss with Zoey was amazing,

00:02.925 --> 00:04.358
<i>and complicated.</i>

00:04.359 --> 00:05.794
Look, um...

00:05.795 --> 00:08.163
I know you're going through a lot right now.

00:08.164 --> 00:10.432
Getting divorced, being single,

00:10.433 --> 00:13.134
figuring out who you are on your own.

00:13.135 --> 00:15.070
Someone knows how to set a mood.

00:15.071 --> 00:17.272
I just mean...

00:17.273 --> 00:19.774
I'm okay taking this slow.

00:19.775 --> 00:21.843
I want to do this right.

00:21.844 --> 00:25.313
<i>My friends, as usual,
were completely supportive.</i>

00:25.314 --> 00:27.182
You're doing this all wrong!

00:27.183 --> 00:29.751
Ted, there are couples
in my kindergarten class

00:29.752 --> 00:31.820
who have moved faster than you two.

00:31.821 --> 00:33.755
Granted, their home lives are not great.

00:33.756 --> 00:34.989
Hey, I'm trying.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.858
I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates,

00:36.859 --> 00:38.777
and she keeps putting on the brakes.

00:38.778 --> 00:42.030
Like tonight, she wants me to
just come over and bake cookies.

00:42.031 --> 00:43.031
Oh.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.532
booty-call.

00:44.533 --> 00:46.201
Total booty-call.

00:46.202 --> 00:48.169
Private Booty, reporting for duty.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.704
That's crazy.

00:49.705 --> 00:50.872
She-She wants to bake.

00:50.873 --> 00:53.274
Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m.

00:53.275 --> 00:56.511
with a drunkenly slurred, "What ya doing?"

00:56.512 --> 00:58.980
But when a lady booty-calls a guy,

00:58.981 --> 01:01.516
she invents a respectable excuse

01:01.517 --> 01:04.251
to mask the fact that she
wants to get stuck real good.

01:04.253 --> 01:05.787
It's called class, Ted.

01:05.788 --> 01:07.155
Wait. That...

01:07.156 --> 01:09.591
You think that's what she means by
"baking cookies"?

01:09.592 --> 01:10.809
Are you kidding?

01:10.810 --> 01:13.728
You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot,

01:13.729 --> 01:16.397
you start licking stuff
off each others' fingers.

01:16.398 --> 01:17.999
Before you know it, she's bent

01:18.000 --> 01:19.734
over the marble island,

01:19.735 --> 01:21.769
and you're spanking her
with a rubber spatula.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.605
And she's screaming, "Stop, Marshall, stop,"

01:23.606 --> 01:26.474
but that's just code for "harder!"

01:27.343 --> 01:28.543
Marshall's been in Minnesota

01:28.544 --> 01:29.644
a while, huh?

01:29.645 --> 01:30.945
So long!

01:30.946 --> 01:33.581
And now he's staying even longer.

01:33.582 --> 01:36.551
His mom has been having a really
hard time since the funeral.

01:36.552 --> 01:38.319
He's waiting on her hand and foot.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.354
But...

01:39.355 --> 01:40.355
it's Valentine's Day.

01:40.356 --> 01:41.823
It's not going to be the same

01:41.824 --> 01:43.758
<i>without the two of us watching
Predator together.</i>

01:43.759 --> 01:45.026
<i>I should explain.</i>

01:45.027 --> 01:46.928
<i>On their very first Valentine's Day,</i>

01:46.929 --> 01:50.231
<i>Marshall and Lily set out to watch
Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

01:50.232 --> 01:54.169
You know, I saw this in the theater,
like, five times,

01:54.170 --> 01:56.771
but I never got to see
it with the right girl.

01:56.772 --> 01:58.173
Aw...

01:58.174 --> 02:01.709
I'm so glad none of those
girls were right for you.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.278
What girls?

02:03.279 --> 02:05.780
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

02:05.781 --> 02:09.918
<i>Except Marshall's brothers had
taped over it with Predator.</i>

02:09.919 --> 02:11.085
Mmm.

02:11.086 --> 02:13.454
<i>And it became a tradition.</i>

02:13.455 --> 02:15.723
Wow, you sound really lonely.

02:15.724 --> 02:19.194
I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...

02:19.195 --> 02:20.762
Shh. Daddy's talking now.

02:20.763 --> 02:23.531
Loneliness. The looming specter

02:23.532 --> 02:25.767
of Valentine's Day fast approaching.

02:25.768 --> 02:29.637
<i>The two key ingredients to my
favorite day of the year,</i>

02:29.638 --> 02:33.007
Desperation Day.

02:33.008 --> 02:35.109
That's not a thing. It's a thing.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.061
Much like Valentine's Day itself,

02:37.062 --> 02:39.380
Desperation Day dates
back thousands of years.

02:39.381 --> 02:41.199
<i> Weddings were forbidden</i>

02:41.200 --> 02:42.450
<i>under ancient Roman law,</i>

02:42.451 --> 02:44.886
<i>so Saint Valentine performed them in secret,</i>

02:44.887 --> 02:46.854
<i>under threat of death.</i>

02:46.855 --> 02:48.990
That's actually true. Wait, there's more.

02:48.991 --> 02:50.191
This won't be.

02:50.192 --> 02:52.026
<i>And right by Saint Valentine's side</i>

02:52.027 --> 02:55.630
<i>was his best bro, Saint Desperatius,</i>

02:55.631 --> 02:58.233
<i>there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.</i>

02:58.234 --> 02:59.634
Whoa. Check out that one.

02:59.635 --> 03:02.303
Her body is a perfect X.

03:02.304 --> 03:06.107
Player, play on. High V.

03:06.108 --> 03:08.376
Oh, Jupiter,

03:08.377 --> 03:10.929
what are your plans for me?

03:10.930 --> 03:13.548
15 and still unmarried.

03:14.783 --> 03:17.919
And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.

03:19.421 --> 03:22.073
Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day.

03:22.074 --> 03:24.359
That neediness reaches its climax--

03:24.360 --> 03:26.828
what up-- on February 13.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.530
A magical night when a ten

03:29.531 --> 03:31.432
has the self-esteem of a four

03:31.433 --> 03:33.801
and the depraved enthusiasm of a two.

03:33.802 --> 03:36.771
Now, there's only one thing you can't do.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.439
Please say "widows."

03:38.440 --> 03:41.743
Wherever you are, or whoever you're under,

03:41.744 --> 03:46.281
<i>you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m.</i>

03:46.282 --> 03:49.417
Otherwise, you're on a
date on Valentine's Day.

03:49.418 --> 03:50.852
Barney, Desperation Day

03:50.853 --> 03:53.888
assumes that all single women
freak out about Valentine's Day.

03:53.889 --> 03:55.490
Which we do not.

03:55.491 --> 03:58.593
Case in point,
I will be spending February 13

03:58.594 --> 04:00.395
with some lovely single ladies from work...

04:00.396 --> 04:02.480
Trolls....who could care less

04:02.481 --> 04:04.399
about Valentine's Day. Lying trolls.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.600
And we will be celebrating
the fact that we don't have

04:06.601 --> 04:08.102
to spend it with some dippy guy

04:08.103 --> 04:10.238
carting around roses and
stuffed toys all night.

04:10.239 --> 04:11.339
Oh, no offense, Ted.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.709
And none was taken until just then.

04:27.690 --> 04:29.724
I decided to go to Minnesota

04:29.725 --> 04:31.059
to see Marshall.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.860
He shouldn't have to help his mom

04:32.861 --> 04:35.229
through this rough time all by himself.

04:35.230 --> 04:37.148
You losing your mind,
being alone in your apartment?

04:37.149 --> 04:38.299
I'm getting weird!

04:38.300 --> 04:40.468
<i> See, it started off</i>

04:40.469 --> 04:43.371
<i>with me throwing Marshall's
jersey on my body pillow.</i>

04:43.372 --> 04:47.375
<i>And, well, things kind of
spiraled from there.</i>

04:48.844 --> 04:51.746
I'm sorry I yelled like that before.

04:52.781 --> 04:55.183
I call him "Marshpillow." And he calls me...

04:55.184 --> 04:57.785
nothing because he's a pillow.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.955
Hey.

05:00.956 --> 05:03.157
Hey. How was "baking cookies" last night?

05:03.158 --> 05:04.826
<i> That was a tough question.</i>

05:04.827 --> 05:06.427
<i>You see...</i>

05:06.862 --> 05:08.129
Hi.

05:08.130 --> 05:10.565
Uh...

05:10.566 --> 05:13.067
Is that an overnight bag?

05:15.904 --> 05:17.872
You brought an overnight bag?

05:17.873 --> 05:19.807
You guys said I was definitely
going to spend the night.

05:19.808 --> 05:20.942
We said you were going to have sex.

05:20.943 --> 05:22.710
We didn't say, "Bring a carry-on."

05:22.711 --> 05:24.679
So how did Zoey react?

05:24.680 --> 05:27.315
She thought it was presumptuous
and asked me to leave.

05:27.316 --> 05:29.717
It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.

05:29.718 --> 05:31.419
Were there slippers for the morning?

05:32.721 --> 05:35.056
Not slippers, exactly.

05:36.325 --> 05:38.793
They're called British morning socks.

05:39.661 --> 05:41.596
<i> This is such a nice surprise.</i>

05:41.597 --> 05:44.382
Marshall will be so happy.

05:44.383 --> 05:45.700
Oh...

05:45.701 --> 05:48.336
How are you holding up, Judy?

05:48.337 --> 05:49.404
Oh, I'm doin' okay.

05:49.405 --> 05:50.888
It gets a little lonely.

05:50.889 --> 05:53.808
My friends suggested a body pillow, but...

05:53.809 --> 05:55.810
I'm not a lunatic.

05:55.811 --> 05:57.061
Hey, Mom?

05:57.062 --> 05:58.713
I hate to be that guy,

05:58.714 --> 06:00.648
but I'm pretty sure it
was Hot Pocket o'clock,

06:00.649 --> 06:02.400
like, ten minutes ago.

06:02.401 --> 06:04.952
Lily. Lily.

06:04.953 --> 06:06.070
What are you doing here?

06:06.071 --> 06:07.822
I wanted to surprise you.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.574
Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet.

06:09.575 --> 06:11.409
I'm so glad you're here.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.194
Hey, um, before I forget, Mom,

06:13.195 --> 06:14.862
did you remember to get
more double-A batteries?

06:14.863 --> 06:15.963
Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie.

06:15.964 --> 06:17.665
Right next to your washed
and folded clothes.

06:17.666 --> 06:20.067
Oh, great, okay. I don't
want my Game Boy to crap out.

06:20.068 --> 06:22.120
I'm having the sickest
Dr. Mario run of my life.

06:22.121 --> 06:23.571
Okay. I'll be right back.

06:23.572 --> 06:24.639
I love you, Lily.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.640
Okay.

06:25.641 --> 06:26.791
You're the best, Mom.

06:26.792 --> 06:30.128
Aw... Anything for my baby bear.

06:30.129 --> 06:32.947
Get him out of my house.

06:37.632 --> 06:39.633
Take Marshall back to New York with you.

06:39.634 --> 06:40.700
Please, I am begging you.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.469
I thought he was here helping you.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.637
Well, he was, at first.

06:43.638 --> 06:44.871
But once he saw me starting

06:44.872 --> 06:46.706
to do better, he kind of regressed.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.509
He's been holed up in his
room for days at a time,

06:49.510 --> 06:50.844
playing old video games.

06:50.845 --> 06:54.181
I mean, he is having a pretty
sick Dr. Mario run, but...

06:55.216 --> 06:56.850
Uh, I'll talk to him.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.318
I want to be there for him,

06:58.319 --> 07:00.887
but it's like he's a teenager again.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.490
I even walked in on him abusing himself.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.691
Oh, God.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.859
There he was, on the bed,

07:05.860 --> 07:07.327
looking at old photos of his dad.

07:07.328 --> 07:10.697
That's emotional self-abuse,
don't you think?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.735
Hi. Hi.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.936
Listen,

07:16.937 --> 07:19.322
that was a dumb move for
me to just assume...

07:19.323 --> 07:20.540
No, no, I overreacted.

07:20.541 --> 07:24.244
I mean, I invited you over to
"bake cookies."

07:24.245 --> 07:25.879
We both knew what that meant.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.846
We totally did.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.248
I just, you know...

07:28.249 --> 07:30.317
I saw those slippers in your bag,

07:30.318 --> 07:31.351
and suddenly everything

07:31.352 --> 07:33.053
felt really serious.

07:33.054 --> 07:36.056
And... ever since, I've been asking myself,

07:36.057 --> 07:38.925
"Am I ready for this?"

07:38.926 --> 07:40.460
And...

07:40.461 --> 07:43.897
the answer is "yes."

07:48.152 --> 07:49.936
They're actually called
British morning socks.

07:49.937 --> 07:50.937
Yeah. Don't get in your own way.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.272
Right. Okay.

07:53.190 --> 07:55.325
Um, Marshall, your mom asked me

07:55.326 --> 07:56.543
to carry this up.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.712
She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels.

07:58.713 --> 08:00.213
Is my track okay?

08:00.214 --> 08:02.782
It's fine, but, Marshall,

08:02.783 --> 08:05.452
I thought you were here
taking care of your mom.

08:05.453 --> 08:07.854
It seems like she's taking care of you.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.857
My mom loves to feel needed.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.192
Letting her take care of me

08:12.193 --> 08:14.561
is how I'm taking care of her.

08:15.363 --> 08:16.930
She's in a dark place, Lily.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.598
She needs this.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.000
Mom?

08:20.001 --> 08:21.301
You forgot my chocolate milk

08:21.302 --> 08:22.836
with the swirly straw!

08:22.837 --> 08:25.939
Oops. Comin' right up!

08:25.940 --> 08:28.275
Ow. Ow.

08:28.276 --> 08:29.609
She needs this.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.345
Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.081
Don't you want to be at home on our couch,

08:35.082 --> 08:37.150
cuddling up under a warm blanket,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.486
watching the Predator use his heat vision

08:39.486 --> 08:42.205
to stalk helpless prey?

08:44.000 --> 08:50.074

08:57.505 --> 08:59.906
<i>Well, baby, we could watch Predator here.</i>

08:59.907 --> 09:01.675
No, my mom can go rent it for us

09:01.676 --> 09:03.510
after she's done digging out the car.

09:03.511 --> 09:04.778
Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.

09:04.779 --> 09:05.812
What?

09:05.813 --> 09:07.714
Anything else, sweetie?

09:07.715 --> 09:10.483
Mom, d-do you want me to leave?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.719
Heavens to Bess, no!

09:12.720 --> 09:14.287
Of course not!

09:14.288 --> 09:15.355
But, Judy, you said...

09:15.356 --> 09:17.791
Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever,

09:17.792 --> 09:21.027
I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.

09:25.116 --> 09:28.084
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

09:28.085 --> 09:30.453
Yeah. You know, there's
this new Italian restaurant

09:30.454 --> 09:32.672
on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.508
I would be happier having just
a simple, home-cooked meal.

09:35.509 --> 09:37.777
As long as it's with you.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.180
Tomorrow night, my place.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.819
I'm ready for this, Ted.

09:45.820 --> 09:46.786
I am in it

09:46.787 --> 09:48.304
for the long haul.

09:48.305 --> 09:51.691
I can't wait for our first
Valentine's Day as a couple.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.862
The one we'll remember for years.

09:57.932 --> 10:00.066
Isn't that great? Yeah, if you say so, yeah.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.167
What do you mean?

10:02.203 --> 10:03.937
Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.205
That's heavy.

10:05.206 --> 10:08.208
I'm kind of freaking out,
just listening to you.

10:08.209 --> 10:09.376
My heart is pounding,

10:09.377 --> 10:10.794
I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.516
Well, it's romantic, right?

10:16.517 --> 10:19.786
Zoey and I are getting
serious on Valentine's Day.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.389
See, that just amps up
the pressure even more.

10:22.390 --> 10:24.891
Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.159
Who said I wasn't sure?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.795
I'm glad we're in a serious relationship.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.296
Right away.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.331
And if I screw this up,

10:31.332 --> 10:32.599
I'm the devil,

10:32.600 --> 10:34.100
because she's going through a divorce.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.985
But I'm not going to screw this up.

10:35.986 --> 10:38.438
So stop freaking out, Robin.

10:38.439 --> 10:39.973
Stop freaking out!

10:39.974 --> 10:42.876
<i>Kids, I'm not super proud
of what I did next.</i>

10:42.877 --> 10:44.160
Hi!

10:44.161 --> 10:45.712
I'm here to help Marshall.

10:47.982 --> 10:49.883
<i>Meanwhile, as Desperation Day</i>

10:49.884 --> 10:51.651
<i>turned into Desperation Night...</i>

10:51.652 --> 10:55.422
God, these girls are so
hungry for male attention.

10:55.423 --> 10:59.859
It is like being a hunter
and having the deer walk up,

10:59.860 --> 11:01.928
tie itself to the hood of your car

11:01.929 --> 11:03.496
and beg to get mounted.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.864
Barney, this is

11:04.865 --> 11:08.001
Bev and Anna, uh,
my coworkers and my friends.

11:08.002 --> 11:11.137
Bev, Anna, this is Barney,
a high-functioning sociopath

11:11.138 --> 11:13.039
and my ex.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.274
<i>Enchanté.</i>

11:14.275 --> 11:16.142
That's French for "What's with the purple?"

11:16.143 --> 11:17.477
Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day,

11:17.478 --> 11:19.546
and everything is pink and red, so Bev

11:19.547 --> 11:20.880
very thoughtfully suggested

11:20.881 --> 11:23.883
that we wear purple to
show how little we care.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.952
I use, uh, colors to express emotion.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.454
Purple is for pride.

11:27.455 --> 11:29.589
It was a stupid idea.

11:29.590 --> 11:31.524
Bev, you look at me.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.827
<i>It's not a stupid idea.</i>

11:33.828 --> 11:35.728
Tonight, we are queens.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.364
And we don't care about some stupid,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.233
sexist, corporate holiday.

11:40.234 --> 11:41.885
Please!

11:41.886 --> 11:45.805
You might as well be dog-earing
a tear-stained bridal magazine

11:45.806 --> 11:47.774
while wolfing down the box of chocolates

11:47.775 --> 11:49.542
you had delivered to yourself at work

11:49.543 --> 11:51.644
from your "fiancé" who no one's ever met.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.680
Gerard is real!

11:54.548 --> 11:55.748
Oh!

11:56.817 --> 12:00.186
Ted... I thought you were going

12:00.187 --> 12:02.956
to talk to Marshall about
coming back to New York.

12:02.957 --> 12:06.459
Yeah, but, you know,
things move so fast in New York.

12:06.460 --> 12:10.263
Why not hang out here until at
least after Valentine's Day?

12:10.264 --> 12:12.265
Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom.

12:12.266 --> 12:14.417
Uh, Mrs. Eriksen,
we're running low on SunnyD!

12:14.418 --> 12:16.503
Is orange juice okay?

12:16.504 --> 12:18.805
No!

12:19.773 --> 12:23.409
Okay, when your "fiancé" Gerard comes back

12:23.410 --> 12:25.345
from fixing cleft palates in Peru,

12:25.346 --> 12:28.014
maybe snatch a photo of
the two of you together,

12:28.015 --> 12:29.549
and then I'll totally believe you.

12:29.550 --> 12:33.686
Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...

12:33.687 --> 12:35.488
Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.423
Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.226
You want to see Anna beat
him in an arm wrestle?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.861
My elbow slipped!

12:43.464 --> 12:45.965
Marshall, I'm going home.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.937
What?

12:50.938 --> 12:53.907
I'm flying out tonight before the big storm,

12:53.908 --> 12:56.175
and I want you to come with me.

12:57.995 --> 13:00.680
I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.

13:00.681 --> 13:03.349
While I'm sure it's been really helpful

13:03.350 --> 13:04.751
for her to have you here

13:04.752 --> 13:07.954
<i>playing Super Mario Kart for
14 hours a day...</i>

13:07.955 --> 13:09.255
<i>You have Super Mario Kart?!</i>

13:09.256 --> 13:11.524
Hell, yeah.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.660
But your mom doesn't need you.

13:13.661 --> 13:15.562
Your life in New York needs you.

13:15.563 --> 13:18.765
It needs you really bad.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.601
Baby, don't go.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.159
Please come home soon.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.082
So, you were an Olympic gymnast?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.083
Silver medal.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.284
Ooh, sorry.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.486
Gold's the only thing that really counts.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.921
That's what my dad said.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.523
And she sticks the landing.

13:43.524 --> 13:46.292
Why don't you start stretching, and I'll...

13:46.293 --> 13:48.461
be right back.

13:48.462 --> 13:49.762
Hey, hey, sorry. Oh, hi.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.130
Quick question. Yeah.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.465
Why aren't you wearing
purple like your friends?

13:52.466 --> 13:54.968
Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is,

13:54.969 --> 13:56.703
I'm kind of protesting their protest.

13:57.371 --> 13:58.404
Can you keep a secret?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.238
Sure.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.140
I love Valentine's Day.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.309
Oh, my gosh! Me, too!

14:03.310 --> 14:05.979
Um, is it getting crowded in here,
'cause I think

14:05.980 --> 14:07.413
there are two peas in this pod?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.215
Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.684
Guilty. This is embarrassing,

14:11.685 --> 14:15.088
but every year, I buy flowers
and a box of chocolates,

14:15.089 --> 14:17.290
even if I'm not with someone.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.692
Just in case, you know?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.894
We are pitiful. The worst.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.897
Although there is one
difference between you and me.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.100
What's that? I'm not saying any of this

14:27.101 --> 14:29.218
to get in your pants.

14:34.642 --> 14:37.410
I miss my dad, Ted.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.647
I miss him so much.

14:40.648 --> 14:42.148
I know.

14:43.851 --> 14:45.384
Um, when I was a kid,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.737
we would spend the summers
in the Upper Peninsula.

14:47.738 --> 14:50.356
And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin

14:50.357 --> 14:52.558
till, like, the middle of the night.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
And so, it would be pitch black,

14:54.228 --> 14:56.195
<i>in the middle of the woods.</i>

14:56.196 --> 14:58.798
<i>And I could never see anything in
front of the headlights,</i>

14:58.799 --> 15:03.169
<i>but I always felt so safe 'cause
my dad was driving.</i>

15:03.170 --> 15:05.638
<i>He was like some sort of superhero</i>

15:05.639 --> 15:08.107
<i>who could just see way out
into the darkness.</i>

15:09.643 --> 15:11.844
Now he's just gone.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.048
And it's pitch black.

15:15.049 --> 15:18.317
And I can't see where I'm going.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.520
I can't see anything.

15:23.157 --> 15:24.524
All right, okay.

15:24.525 --> 15:25.925
I was playing you before.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.394
But I was really doing you a public service.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.296
It's February 13--

15:30.297 --> 15:33.666
a day many are now calling Desperation Day.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.068
It's kind of a thing.

15:35.069 --> 15:38.371
And you walking around,
saying you're a gooey romantic?

15:38.372 --> 15:41.240
It comes across a bit desperate.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.777
What's desperate about
knowing what you want?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.679
Look, life is really short, Barney.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.715
Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone,

15:48.716 --> 15:50.383
distracting yourself from the fact

15:50.384 --> 15:53.886
that nobody loves you with
some sad little activity?

15:53.887 --> 15:56.622
Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual

15:56.623 --> 15:59.659
Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.628
I have no idea what any of those words mean.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.198
Hey, I'm all stretched out!

16:06.867 --> 16:09.802
Here's the first thing you
need to know about laser tag.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.938
Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.

16:11.939 --> 16:13.406
Yeah.

16:13.407 --> 16:16.609
Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey

16:16.610 --> 16:18.644
that you're here for Valentine's Day?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.914
Well, I mean, technically,
she doesn't know yet.

16:21.915 --> 16:22.749
What?

16:22.750 --> 16:24.083
Things with Zoey

16:24.084 --> 16:25.785
are moving really fast,

16:25.786 --> 16:28.454
and the divorce just makes
everything more complicated.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.990
I just, I needed to take a step back.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.558
You're not taking a step back.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.060
You're running away.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.328
And hiding out here,

16:35.329 --> 16:37.930
hiding out here is not gonna solve anything.

16:37.931 --> 16:38.898
You're just

16:38.899 --> 16:40.366
holed up in Minnesota

16:40.367 --> 16:43.536
because you're too scared
to face reality, and it's...

16:46.106 --> 16:49.909
We got to go back to New York, tonight.

16:49.910 --> 16:52.111
We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.147
So, we drive. It's time.

16:54.148 --> 16:56.449
It's time to get back to real life.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.152
It's time to grow up.

16:59.153 --> 17:00.319
Yeah.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.587
Mom!

17:01.588 --> 17:04.457
Can you make us some PB
and J's for the road?

17:04.458 --> 17:05.758
Crusts cut off.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.827
Crusts cut off!

17:07.828 --> 17:09.529
No, Ted. What are we...?

17:10.964 --> 17:13.532
We're men.

17:14.635 --> 17:16.769
Mom!

17:16.770 --> 17:19.939
Leave the crusts on!

17:24.280 --> 17:26.582
They forced their opponents to scatter,
picking them off,

17:26.583 --> 17:29.402
one by one, in a swift
and merciless slaughter.

17:31.738 --> 17:33.472
became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.

17:34.473 --> 17:37.342
Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!

17:37.343 --> 17:38.593
Oh, it is.

17:38.594 --> 17:40.495
Plus, if you win, you get free pizza!

17:40.496 --> 17:43.198
This is my teammate for tomorrow.

17:43.199 --> 17:44.966
Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.901
Where are Bev and Anna?

17:46.902 --> 17:47.769
Well...

17:47.770 --> 17:49.337
So, we're taking off.

17:49.338 --> 17:50.372
What?

17:50.373 --> 17:51.573
Those guys are gonna

17:51.574 --> 17:53.408
buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.

17:53.409 --> 17:55.243
What...? So that's it?

17:55.244 --> 17:59.247
A couple of white Urkels offer
you sausages, and you're gone?

17:59.248 --> 18:01.182
What about the sisterhood?

18:01.183 --> 18:03.151
Solidarity? The color purple?

18:03.152 --> 18:05.687
But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.

18:05.688 --> 18:07.322
I thought we didn't care
about Valentine's Day.

18:07.323 --> 18:09.624
Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.059
You're a queen.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.594
You've got so much to offer.

18:12.595 --> 18:14.496
Maybe do something with that hair.

18:16.098 --> 18:17.265
I'm telling you.

18:17.266 --> 18:18.600
The power of Valentine's Day.

18:18.601 --> 18:22.404
I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.

18:23.272 --> 18:24.773
Well, I think I'm heading out, too.

18:24.774 --> 18:27.192
What? No, don't go!
You want to see a magic trick?!

18:27.193 --> 18:29.510
It's late, and I have a date with my pillow.

18:29.511 --> 18:31.679
I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.615
Boy Scout Troop 15

18:33.616 --> 18:34.849
doesn't stand a chance.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.751
Bye.

18:36.752 --> 18:38.453
Mm.

18:42.358 --> 18:45.627
Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...

18:45.628 --> 18:47.295
What are you talking about?

18:47.296 --> 18:48.563
Oh, come on.

18:48.564 --> 18:49.964
It's-It's past midnight.

18:49.965 --> 18:52.467
Desperation Day has come and gone,

18:52.468 --> 18:55.670
and you have neither gone nor come.

18:56.372 --> 18:58.173
You know why?

18:58.174 --> 18:59.307
You like Nora.

18:59.308 --> 19:00.542
No, I don't. She's gross.

19:00.543 --> 19:02.610
<i>Oh... You like her.</i>

19:02.611 --> 19:05.113
You think she smells like rain.

19:05.114 --> 19:06.948
Whatever you say.

19:06.949 --> 19:08.266
Oh, hey, Nora.

19:08.267 --> 19:09.734
Nora...

19:18.727 --> 19:20.728
Here's a secret.

19:20.729 --> 19:24.632
I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy.

19:24.633 --> 19:28.770
I just kept driving forward,
hoping for the best.

19:30.539 --> 19:32.624
Look out!

19:32.625 --> 19:33.942
Gotcha.

19:42.318 --> 19:44.285
<i>And so we drove through the night,</i>

19:44.286 --> 19:46.554
<i>out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's.</i>

19:46.555 --> 19:49.290
<i>And there was no trace of my
little freak out, except...</i>

19:49.291 --> 19:52.193
Really? An overnight bag
for your own living room?

19:54.430 --> 19:56.831
Looks like we got a matching set.

19:56.832 --> 19:59.767
Well, that was kind of presumptuous.

20:02.671 --> 20:04.822

20:04.823 --> 20:07.141
Robin, where are you?

20:07.142 --> 20:09.043
Those Boy Scouts have grown
a foot since last year.

20:09.044 --> 20:10.211
They're terrifying!

20:10.212 --> 20:11.613
Oh, yeah.

20:11.614 --> 20:13.181
Change of plans.

20:13.182 --> 20:14.716
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:14.717 --> 20:16.784
Hap...? Hey, Barney.

20:16.785 --> 20:18.953
Robin told me to meet you guys here.

20:18.954 --> 20:21.322
<i>And that's how, for the first
time in his life,</i>

20:21.323 --> 20:24.459
<i>Barney Stinson wound up on a
date on Valentine's Day.</i>

20:25.728 --> 20:26.811
Oh!

20:29.798 --> 20:31.032
