WEBVTT

00:01.711 --> 00:03.713
We were born in space.

00:03.922 --> 00:06.299
They told us the ground
was uninhabited,

00:06.508 --> 00:08.301
but they were wrong,
and we've been fighting

00:08.510 --> 00:11.846
for our lives since
the moment we landed.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.516
Some of us have been
broken by it,

00:14.724 --> 00:16.476
but most of us are still here,

00:16.685 --> 00:18.895
searching for other survivors
from the ark,

00:19.104 --> 00:21.189
trying to build something
real and lasting

00:21.398 --> 00:23.608
out of the wilderness--a home.

00:23.817 --> 00:25.318
Our leaders believe
that to survive,

00:25.527 --> 00:28.113
we need to make peace
with the grounders,

00:28.321 --> 00:31.574
but peace
is a foreign concept here.

00:31.783 --> 00:33.284
I'm not going in.

00:33.493 --> 00:35.662
It's just gonna remind me
of what I did to get them here.

00:38.123 --> 00:39.207
Pike?

00:39.416 --> 00:40.208
How many of you
are there?

00:40.417 --> 00:41.668
63.

00:41.876 --> 00:42.919
Farm station left orbit
with 3 times that number.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.838
We landed with
that number, too.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.048
The ice nation
can be ruthless.

00:47.257 --> 00:49.592
Their queen wants
Clarke's power.

00:51.094 --> 00:51.678
Wanheda...

00:55.348 --> 00:57.017
Hello, Clarke.

01:13.033 --> 01:16.119
What part of "I won't
see you" was unclear?

01:16.327 --> 01:18.621
I respected your wishes
for a week, Clarke.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.206
We've got
bigger concerns.

01:20.415 --> 01:21.875
"We" don't have
any concerns at all.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.377
Yes, we do.

01:24.586 --> 01:26.588
I'm hosting a summit
with Skaikru at sundown.

01:26.755 --> 01:29.007
You'll be returned
to your people.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.592
You went to all that
trouble to capture me

01:30.800 --> 01:32.052
just to let me go?

01:32.260 --> 01:35.263
I went to all that
trouble to save you.

01:35.472 --> 01:39.434
You know when
I could've used saving?

01:39.642 --> 01:42.145
When you abandoned me
at mount weather.

01:42.353 --> 01:45.106
Clearly, you didn't
need my help.

01:45.315 --> 01:47.233
Clearly.

01:47.442 --> 01:50.445
You're angry, Clarke,
but I know you.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.155
What you've done
haunts you,

01:52.363 --> 01:53.531
and it's easier
to hate me

01:53.740 --> 01:55.867
than to hate
yourself.

01:56.076 --> 01:58.787
Oh, I can do both.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.163
What would
you have done

02:00.371 --> 02:02.332
if their leader had
offered you the deal--

02:02.540 --> 02:04.292
save your people at
the price of mine?

02:04.501 --> 02:05.794
Would you really have
chosen differently?

02:06.002 --> 02:08.046
I don't betray
my friends.

02:08.254 --> 02:10.465
But you did.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.343
You had friends
in mount weather.

02:13.551 --> 02:15.553
Those deaths
are on you, too.

02:15.762 --> 02:17.263
The only difference is,

02:17.472 --> 02:20.809
you have no honor,
and I had no choice.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.560
It helps no one to
dwell on the past,

02:22.769 --> 02:24.270
and that's not
why I'm here.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.772
You're right.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.023
I'm not just letting you
go back to your people.

02:27.232 --> 02:28.775
I want something more.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.237
I want your people
to become my people.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.740
I'm offering Skaikru
the chance

02:35.949 --> 02:37.450
to join
my coalition,

02:37.659 --> 02:39.369
become
the 13th clan.

02:39.577 --> 02:40.703
No one would dare
to move against you

02:40.912 --> 02:42.497
because that would be
moving against me.

02:42.705 --> 02:45.416
Just leave me alone.
I'm done.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.127
Do you understand that?
I left.

02:47.335 --> 02:51.089
You can't run away from
who you are, Clarke.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.341
Join me.

02:53.508 --> 02:56.302
Bow before me, and your
people will be safe.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.888
Bow before you?

02:59.097 --> 03:02.892
You don't give a damn
about my people.

03:03.101 --> 03:06.187
I know why you're here.

03:06.396 --> 03:08.398
I made you look weak
at mount weather,

03:08.606 --> 03:11.943
and now the ice nation
is exploiting that.

03:12.152 --> 03:16.698
Well, if you want the power
of Wanheda, kill me.

03:16.865 --> 03:18.908
Take it.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.244
Otherwise,
go float yourself

03:21.452 --> 03:24.831
because I will
never bow to you.

04:03.328 --> 04:05.371
Stand down, Titus.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.339
And you will
use it, too,

04:14.547 --> 04:16.299
in honor of our
guests this evening.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.592
Now sit.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.677
We have more important
matters to discuss.

04:21.888 --> 04:23.640
Yes. We do...

04:25.558 --> 04:28.061
For example, why
is Wanheda still alive?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.104
If this is your
weakness again,

04:30.271 --> 04:31.689
Azgeda will
happily step in.

04:31.898 --> 04:34.067
Is that why your army
has moved so close to Polis,

04:34.275 --> 04:36.361
because you believe
the commander is weak?

04:36.569 --> 04:38.738
Oh, those are just
military exercises.

04:38.947 --> 04:40.531
Exercises?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.408
You crossed the border
into Trikru land,

04:42.617 --> 04:44.369
an army within
striking distance

04:44.577 --> 04:45.745
of our beloved
capital.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.455
A mistake that was
quickly rectified,

04:47.664 --> 04:48.831
as you well know.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.875
The ice queen
doesn't make mistakes.

04:51.084 --> 04:53.711
She makes threats.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.422
There's no need to argue
about this again.

04:56.631 --> 05:01.261
Please come join me.
Let us speak in private.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.013
I have a message
for queen Nia.

05:04.222 --> 05:05.640
And I'll
happily deliver.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.058
Uh!
Ooh!

05:07.267 --> 05:12.105
Aah!

05:12.313 --> 05:13.147
Oh!

05:15.858 --> 05:18.903
Would anyone else care
to question my decisions?

05:23.366 --> 05:26.494
Good. Then let's begin.

06:04.449 --> 06:06.117
We're at the Polis
city limits.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.161
From here,
we go on foot.

06:08.828 --> 06:10.121
Lexa's guards
will be here soon.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.789
All guns and radios
stay in the truck.

06:11.998 --> 06:14.709
Her people will escort
us to the summit.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.502
- Nelson...
- Sir.

06:16.711 --> 06:17.587
- Hill...
- Yes, sir.

06:17.795 --> 06:18.880
Stay here.
Man the radio.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.423
Yes, sir.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.509
What is that?

06:23.718 --> 06:24.761
It's a med kit.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.013
A med kit
from mount weather,

06:27.221 --> 06:30.016
the place where thousands
of their people were killed.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.938
You can't bring this
into Polis.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.692
Don't take it out
on him.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.444
If you're gonna be mad,
be mad at me.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.154
Moving people
into mount weather

06:43.363 --> 06:45.156
puts our entire
agenda at risk.

06:45.365 --> 06:46.824
You knew that, and
you did it, anyway.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.910
Would you have preferred
that I let Nyko die?

06:49.118 --> 06:51.496
We're past that.

06:51.704 --> 06:54.457
Opening a hospital
is one thing.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.376
Moving farm station
survivors in is another.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.044
It was a few people,
Marcus,

06:58.252 --> 06:59.337
an exploratory group.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.922
That's not
the point.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.008
Now we have to explain,
taking attention

07:04.217 --> 07:05.301
away from
everything else

07:05.510 --> 07:06.719
we've been
negotiating for--

07:06.928 --> 07:08.262
lifting Lincoln's
kill order,

07:08.471 --> 07:10.848
opening trade routes,
getting Clarke back.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.686
I shouldn't
have said that.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.565
Clarke's not
a bargaining chip.

07:21.818 --> 07:25.154
What if they won't
give her back

07:25.363 --> 07:28.157
and it's my fault?

07:28.366 --> 07:31.160
We won't leave
without your daughter...

07:33.162 --> 07:35.123
Promise.

07:49.804 --> 07:50.680
Ohh...

07:50.888 --> 07:53.433
I knew I should've
taken my horse.

07:55.268 --> 07:56.519
Hey...

07:57.103 --> 07:59.939
The summit delegation
will be fine.

08:01.107 --> 08:03.151
I should be there.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.570
Then you wouldn't
be here with me.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.410
You make a good
argument.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.370
Besides, as soon
as your leg heals,

08:14.579 --> 08:15.830
you'll be right
back out there.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.249
My leg's fine.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.669
Kane's trying to
teach me a lesson.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.720
You guys,
did I ever tell you

08:30.928 --> 08:33.431
how I saved Sinclair's
ass on the ark?

08:33.639 --> 08:35.224
Please don't.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.434
You mean the time
he went rogue

08:36.642 --> 08:38.311
on a space walk?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.521
That depends on your
definition of "going rogue."

08:40.730 --> 08:41.814
Really?

08:42.023 --> 08:42.982
I just hopped
on a robotic arm

08:43.191 --> 08:44.942
and aimed it
at the solar array.

08:45.151 --> 08:46.277
The whole time
I was out there,

08:46.486 --> 08:47.361
the control room
thought

08:47.570 --> 08:48.654
I was just fixing
a loose wire.

08:48.863 --> 08:50.573
That is, in fact,

08:50.781 --> 08:51.949
the definition
of "going rogue."

08:52.158 --> 08:53.367
You dangled yourself
within inches

08:53.576 --> 08:54.535
of an
electrified array

08:54.744 --> 08:55.745
that could've
killed you.

08:55.953 --> 08:56.954
Only time I ever
heard Sinclair

08:57.163 --> 08:58.915
lose his cool
on comms.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.374
So how long were
you benched?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.960
Benched? I got the job
done in record time.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.129
He promoted me.
What can I say?

09:05.338 --> 09:07.507
Sinclair thinks
I can do no wrong.

09:13.471 --> 09:15.973
♪♪ I ain't gonna stop... ♪♪

09:16.182 --> 09:18.434
Welcome.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.271
Come. Join us.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.482
Someone's made
themselves at home.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.025
There must be 30
of them in here.

09:26.234 --> 09:30.071
36, but the more,
the merrier. Ha!

09:30.279 --> 09:34.408
36? Wow. The grounders
are gonna think we moved in.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.246
Well, there was
no room at the inn.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.873
- And this is your option?
- O.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.084
I'm out of here.

09:49.048 --> 09:50.591
Spirited.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.343
Yeah.

09:52.552 --> 09:54.470
Reyes,
you're 3 hours late.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.764
We've got no power
to medical,

09:56.973 --> 09:58.516
fluctuations on
levels two and 3,

09:58.724 --> 10:00.518
and blown fuses
all over the place.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.061
Get on it.

10:03.563 --> 10:06.440
You can do
no wrong, huh?

10:18.995 --> 10:21.956
Well, if it isn't
the prince of Azgeda.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.624
Don't be fooled.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.710
I'm a prisoner here,
same as you.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.837
You're the reason
I'm a prisoner here.

10:28.045 --> 10:31.173
Relax, Wanheda.
I'm here to help you.

10:31.382 --> 10:33.467
Sure you are.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.389
Commander promised
to lift my banishment

10:38.598 --> 10:41.559
if I delivered you
safely.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.145
She broke our deal.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.147
I'm willing to strike
a new one with you

10:46.355 --> 10:47.857
so we can both
go home.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.984
I'm already
going home.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.319
Then you won't
have a chance to get

10:51.527 --> 10:52.862
what you
really want.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.572
What would you know
about what I want?

10:54.780 --> 10:57.283
I saw the look on your face
when I took that hood off.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.827
You want revenge.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.337
You want
to kill her.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.133
So kill her.

11:14.342 --> 11:16.677
You can get close.
I can't.

11:16.886 --> 11:18.054
You'll find a knife
under your bed

11:18.262 --> 11:19.722
when you return
to your room.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.098
I've already bought
enough of the guards

11:21.307 --> 11:22.892
to get you
out of here.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.435
If you do this, Azgeda
will take control

11:24.644 --> 11:26.354
of the coalition,
and you'll find

11:26.562 --> 11:29.649
a strong and grateful
ally in the ice queen.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.776
And why should
I trust her?

11:31.984 --> 11:34.403
From what I hear,
she's worse than Lexa.

11:34.612 --> 11:37.198
That's because you've
been talking to Lexa.

11:37.365 --> 11:41.869
Look. We're all trying to do
what's right for our people.

11:42.078 --> 11:44.580
This is what's right
for yours.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.606
You OK?

12:23.327 --> 12:24.495
Ah...

12:33.003 --> 12:35.923
This is such
a mistake.

12:36.132 --> 12:38.467
The grounders will
never accept it.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.473
We're not
the Mountain men, o.

12:44.682 --> 12:48.352
Nyko and Lincoln will
make them see that.

12:48.561 --> 12:51.105
How? Lincoln has
a kill order on him?

12:51.313 --> 12:54.525
He can't even leave camp
without risking his life.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.819
The summit will
take care of that.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.780
Then we can finally
get out of here.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.664
I'm sorry, bell.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.293
I don't fit in here.

13:14.837 --> 13:18.549
If you need to
leave, I get that,

13:18.758 --> 13:20.801
but you'll always
fit in with me.

13:23.471 --> 13:25.639
All right. Go.

13:27.183 --> 13:29.435
What now?

13:35.608 --> 13:37.109
- Echo?
- You know her?

13:37.318 --> 13:38.527
Yeah.
She's ice nation.

13:38.736 --> 13:40.446
She was in the cage
next to mine.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.947
- Bellamy.
- Let her go.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.699
- She threatened the summit.
- I was trying to help.

13:43.908 --> 13:45.242
- Shut up.
- Uh!

13:45.451 --> 13:48.078
- Leave her alone.
- I said get your hands off her.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.915
What are you doing?
She's a grounder.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.504
What are you
talking about?

13:56.712 --> 13:58.005
The summit's a trap.

13:58.214 --> 13:59.632
The assassin is
already there.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.092
By sundown, your
people will die.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.323
Why the hell are they
calling us off?

14:24.532 --> 14:25.908
I've got tripped circuits
all over the grid.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.618
Oh, whatever it is

14:27.827 --> 14:30.287
supersedes fixing
the power problem.

14:33.541 --> 14:36.710
I was with the queen's
army heading toward Polis.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.921
The war chief
talks too loud.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.882
You're one of them,
so what are you telling us this?

14:42.091 --> 14:45.219
We abandoned Skaikru in
the battle for the Mountain.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.388
It was wrong.

14:47.555 --> 14:49.473
And won't
they miss you?

14:49.682 --> 14:51.851
Maybe. That's why
we need to hurry.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.479
Pike, she saved my life.
We can trust her.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.399
Listen up. OK.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.733
If we want to get to
Polis before the attack,

14:59.942 --> 15:00.985
we have to move.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.653
Attack? Do we have
confirmation of that?

15:02.862 --> 15:04.238
We radioed,
but no answer.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.156
They may already be dead,
for all we know,

15:06.365 --> 15:09.952
and if they are, we need
to be ready to respond.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.829
Don't make this
about the missiles.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.330
This is
about survival.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.665
We don't have
the numbers,

15:14.874 --> 15:16.083
but the missiles
in this Mountain

15:16.292 --> 15:18.627
even the playing field,
and you know I'm right.

15:18.836 --> 15:19.837
Even if I did
agree with you,

15:20.045 --> 15:21.422
we still don't have
the launch codes.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.883
No, but we have me.

15:26.427 --> 15:28.387
And you accuse engineers
of arrogance?

15:28.596 --> 15:30.639
I'm growing
as a person.

15:32.141 --> 15:33.267
Let's go.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.729
You should stay here,
help them get

15:36.937 --> 15:39.523
those missiles
ready to launch.

15:42.318 --> 15:45.487
Don't do anything
stupidly heroic.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.199
Garden-variety
heroic. You got it.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.662
Incredible.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.948
Marcus,
they're staring.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.826
We're under the
commander's protection.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.788
In Polis, only
the sentries are armed.

17:29.758 --> 17:30.676
Teik em in.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.344
No, thank you.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.346
Teik em in.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.978
Teik em in.

17:45.441 --> 17:48.277
Mm. Delicious.

17:57.453 --> 17:59.329
Beja.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.801
You're suited
for this.

18:15.471 --> 18:17.639
It's amazing.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.601
When I dreamt
of the ground,

18:20.809 --> 18:22.144
it was empty.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.813
But it's not
empty now.

18:25.022 --> 18:27.649
Marcus, you gave
this to me,

18:27.858 --> 18:31.403
and you asked me to set
a good example,

18:31.612 --> 18:33.363
but what we're
trying to do here

18:33.572 --> 18:36.241
is something new,
something--

18:36.450 --> 18:39.453
something you have
a vision for.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.835
This should be yours.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.341
Not like this.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.051
We've been passing
the chancellor's pin

18:54.259 --> 18:55.803
since we landed
on the ground.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.888
This time, it's
up to the people.

18:58.097 --> 18:59.431
Well, then let's
hold an election

18:59.640 --> 19:01.225
when we get back
to Arkadia.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.104
No matter
who wears the pin,

19:05.312 --> 19:06.480
we're in this
together.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.816
Kane.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.984
Hello, my friend.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.154
Chancellor Griffin,
welcome.

19:14.363 --> 19:15.572
I hope you're
enjoying the capital.

19:15.781 --> 19:16.907
I am, and thank you

19:17.116 --> 19:18.826
for ensuring my
daughter's safety.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.619
The commander did that.

19:20.828 --> 19:21.912
You can
thank her yourself

19:22.121 --> 19:23.122
at the summit
tonight.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.832
- I would like to see Clarke.
- Soon.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.876
Abby--

19:28.085 --> 19:31.338
see? You are
suited for this.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.471
Good, Aden. Again.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.352
Uh!

19:47.729 --> 19:50.065
They're here.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.825
Aden is ready.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.994
He's even
better than I was

20:02.202 --> 20:04.371
before my conclave.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.750
You still think the
summit is a bad idea.

20:08.959 --> 20:11.211
You mean well, Heda,

20:11.420 --> 20:15.048
but now is not the time
for good intentions.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.717
Your enemies
are circling.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.635
Queen Nia moves
against you.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.345
Our focus
should be there.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.348
Instead, you
antagonize her further

20:23.557 --> 20:24.975
by offering
the Skaikru a seat

20:25.184 --> 20:28.187
at your table.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.105
I will not let
the fear of war

20:30.314 --> 20:32.149
dictate our agenda.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.068
Why are you
doing this?

20:35.277 --> 20:38.363
Sky people are here
to negotiate a treaty,

20:38.572 --> 20:40.824
not join
the coalition.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.576
They didn't
ask for this.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.078
Not one of the 12 clans
will accept it.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.164
They will accept it

20:47.372 --> 20:50.542
when they see
Wanheda bow before me.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.921
She won't even
see you,

20:54.129 --> 20:56.965
yet everything
you do elevates her.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.009
Why?

20:59.218 --> 21:01.678
Clarke elevates
herself.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.931
She's special.

21:04.139 --> 21:08.018
You're special,
Heda.

21:08.227 --> 21:11.355
I've been the Fleimkepa
for 4 commanders.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.357
No one has done
what you have.

21:13.565 --> 21:17.694
We are so close
to our goal.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.239
If you want the
power of Wanheda,

21:20.447 --> 21:22.032
you know
what must be done.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.867
You strike her down.

21:24.076 --> 21:26.828
Kill her.
Take her power.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.259
Damn it.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.011
What happened to that
Raven Reyes confidence?

21:43.220 --> 21:44.346
It's a
12-digit code.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.098
There are a trillion
combinations.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.434
It's gonna
take me a minute.

21:50.769 --> 21:52.020
Gina, what do you got?

21:52.229 --> 21:54.106
Don't look at me.
I'm just a grunt.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.899
Oh, come on, guys.

21:56.108 --> 21:59.820
It's gonna be dark soon.
We're working analog.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.072
We're working digital.
What are we missing?

22:02.281 --> 22:05.367
How is the president gonna
remember a number that long?

22:05.575 --> 22:06.868
Not well.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.495
Want to bet he wrote
it down somewhere?

22:08.704 --> 22:09.955
Oh, come on.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.499
That's like setting the
launch codes all zeros.

22:12.708 --> 22:16.169
And yet it's better than
anything we've come up with.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.088
I'll check the
president's office.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.215
We'll keep working
the tech angle.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.634
Hopefully,
one of us'll get lucky.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.971
Like that's
ever happened.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.155
Where are the guards?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.823
Uh!

22:49.036 --> 22:51.705
Protocol would be
to leave someone behind.

22:59.254 --> 23:00.964
They did.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.307
This was
your people.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.976
Hey, she warned us.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.771
This proves she was
telling the truth.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.273
We don't have time for this.
The attack is at sundown.

23:20.359 --> 23:22.444
I'm not leaving
my blade here.

23:22.652 --> 23:23.612
None of us are.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.988
We go in through
the tunnels.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.115
The entrance
is this way.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.271
You wanted to see me?
I'm here.

24:02.401 --> 24:03.819
Clarke--

24:04.027 --> 24:05.821
uh!

24:06.029 --> 24:07.364
Right.

24:19.835 --> 24:24.297
I'm sorry.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.311
I never meant
to turn you into this.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.608
You're free to go.

24:43.817 --> 24:47.279
Your mother is here.
I'll have you escorted to her.

24:50.449 --> 24:55.787
Wait. I have
a better idea.

25:03.587 --> 25:07.174
The sun
is going down.

25:07.382 --> 25:10.177
Where's Lexa?

25:10.385 --> 25:13.430
She'll be here soon.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.102
Here we go.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.160
I have something
to tell you,

25:35.368 --> 25:36.661
and we don't
have much time.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.289
Wait a minute.
Just let me look at you.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.543
We'll have plenty of time to
catch up once we get back home.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.712
The commander's changing
the terms of the summit.

25:45.921 --> 25:47.255
Is this because
of mount weather?

25:47.464 --> 25:49.049
This is because
of the ice nation.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.343
They want Lexa dead.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.844
They want to take
over the coalition.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.804
That's Lexa's concern,
not ours.

25:55.013 --> 25:58.642
No, Abby. If Lexa falls,
the coalition shatters,

25:58.850 --> 26:01.353
and there's no way
we avoid that war.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.981
You said
there were new terms.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.234
We become
the 13th clan.

26:15.325 --> 26:20.664
13th clan? What does that mean,
that we follow Lexa?

26:20.872 --> 26:22.541
Yes.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.751
We came here to
negotiate a treaty.

26:24.918 --> 26:27.254
This is our
unity day, mom.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.422
You can be
the 13th station,

26:29.631 --> 26:32.259
or you can
be the 13th clan.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.806
Marcus?

26:38.014 --> 26:39.683
Clarke's right.

26:39.891 --> 26:41.685
I've seen
the ice nation army,

26:41.893 --> 26:43.979
and we don't stand
a chance against them.

26:44.187 --> 26:46.815
We need to do this.

26:53.238 --> 26:56.533
So we become
the 13th clan.

26:56.741 --> 27:01.079
Then what? What's gonna
stop the ice nation?

27:02.497 --> 27:04.874
Wanheda.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.239
How much further?

27:36.448 --> 27:37.824
We're almost there.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.868
The elevator shaft
is just ahead.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.848
- Two guards.
- They raise the lift.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.267
The elevator shaft
is our only way in.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.769
We have to climb.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.606
I got left.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.806
Look out!

28:43.014 --> 28:44.557
Huh! Agh!

28:44.766 --> 28:46.851
Ugh...

28:47.060 --> 28:49.562
Uh! Agh!

29:17.006 --> 29:20.093
What is wrong with you?
You didn't have to kill them.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.346
Yeah, I did.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.856
How many floors?

29:33.064 --> 29:35.692
All of them.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.925
Hail, warriors
of the 12 clans.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.845
Hail,
commander of the blood.

30:04.053 --> 30:06.973
Rise.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.687
We welcome Skaikru
to our halls

30:12.896 --> 30:14.689
in the spirit
of friendship and harmony,

30:14.898 --> 30:17.525
and we welcome
Clarke Kom Skaikru--

30:17.734 --> 30:21.863
legendary Wanheda,
Mountain slayer.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.324
The reason for this summit
has changed.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.076
We are not here to negotiate
a treaty with the Skaikru,

30:27.285 --> 30:30.455
but rather to initiate them
into the coalition.

30:35.001 --> 30:38.797
To symbolize this union,

30:39.005 --> 30:41.591
the leader of Skaikru
must bear our mark.

30:49.182 --> 30:51.392
The honor
should be yours.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.733
Present your arm.

31:11.955 --> 31:14.457
Nngh! Uh...

31:16.084 --> 31:18.211
That's it. Go. Go.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.380
Bellamy?

31:20.588 --> 31:22.048
What is
the meaning of this?

31:22.257 --> 31:24.217
The summit's
a trap.

31:24.425 --> 31:26.219
We need to get
you out of here.

31:26.427 --> 31:27.679
What the hell
is going on?

31:27.887 --> 31:28.972
I don't know.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.932
It's the ice nation.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.892
These allegations
are an outrage.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.477
The ice nation never
stormed this summit

31:34.686 --> 31:36.938
with weapons,
breaking our laws.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.481
That was the Skaikru.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.024
We're right
about this.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.902
The two guards you left
behind are dead already.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.654
We need to go now.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.323
How did you come
by this information?

31:51.286 --> 31:53.246
Where the hell is echo?

32:22.609 --> 32:23.776
Uh! Uh!

32:25.820 --> 32:28.114
Uh! I tried everything,

32:28.323 --> 32:29.782
still completely locked
out of the missile system.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.326
Uh! Mm!

32:31.534 --> 32:34.370
They had impressive security.
I'll give them that.

32:34.579 --> 32:37.582
Uh...Uh!

32:41.336 --> 32:43.254
This is useless.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.798
I'm better with
hydrazine and gun powder.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.718
- Reyes--
- I give up.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.929
We're too late, anyway.
It's already dark.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.101
Raven...

32:57.310 --> 33:00.688
The raven Reyes I know
doesn't give up.

33:00.897 --> 33:02.815
She does now.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.526
No, she doesn't.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.070
Have you
talked to Abby?

33:07.278 --> 33:08.488
About what?

33:08.655 --> 33:10.782
Raven, come on. You're
not fooling anyone.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.201
I'm not trying to.

33:15.328 --> 33:17.705
If this machine
was broken

33:17.914 --> 33:19.624
and you knew there
was a way to fix it,

33:19.832 --> 33:23.544
would you not do it
because it might be hard?

33:23.753 --> 33:26.005
Why the resistance?

33:29.175 --> 33:31.094
You think you
deserve this pain,

33:31.302 --> 33:32.387
that this is
your cross to bear

33:32.595 --> 33:34.764
for your mom
or Finn,

33:34.973 --> 33:36.265
for all you've
been through.

33:36.474 --> 33:37.684
It's not.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.644
You deserve more,

33:39.852 --> 33:41.437
and with the medical
equipment in this building,

33:41.646 --> 33:44.524
Abby can help you.

33:44.732 --> 33:46.818
Let her.

33:49.988 --> 33:52.198
What if she can't?

33:56.911 --> 33:59.706
What if I'm just broken?

34:05.378 --> 34:08.548
I took a chance
on a zero-g mechanic

34:08.715 --> 34:11.467
with a heart defect.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.137
Why don't you take
a chance on her, too?

34:27.442 --> 34:29.402
Gina, on radio:
Gina to raven. Come in.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.903
Go for raven.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.823
I got nothing,
no launch codes.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.200
I guess our luck
is still holding.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.037
OK. Keep looking.
I'll do the same.

34:40.329 --> 34:43.082
Aah aah aah!

34:45.501 --> 34:49.255
Gina? Gina?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.132
Gina, are you there?

34:55.053 --> 34:57.972
Gina?
Gina, do you copy?

35:03.603 --> 35:06.272
Raven, on radio:
Gina, what's going on?

35:12.361 --> 35:14.822
Gina, are you OK?

35:20.369 --> 35:21.829
Gina.

35:26.751 --> 35:29.462
Raven, we've
got a problem.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.048
A grounder set off
a self-destruct sequence.

35:32.256 --> 35:35.051
He has the codes on his arm.
You have to get them.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.650
How much time, Gina?

35:50.858 --> 35:52.485
45 seconds, raven.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.370
Uh!

36:07.500 --> 36:08.960
Huh!

36:09.168 --> 36:10.878
Uh!

36:12.004 --> 36:13.798
Yuh!

36:14.006 --> 36:16.467
Uh! Ooh!

36:16.676 --> 36:20.054
Aagh! Uh! Uh!

36:20.263 --> 36:23.516
Ugh! Agh!

36:23.724 --> 36:26.894
Uh! Mmph!

36:35.236 --> 36:37.822
Get the numbers
on his arm.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.240
Huh. Ugh!

36:39.448 --> 36:41.659
Gina, Gina,
we got the code.

36:41.868 --> 36:45.788
Gina, do you copy?
Gina, do you copy?

36:51.419 --> 36:53.296
- Got to go back in there.
- No. Raven, no.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.464
We can't just
let them die.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.053
Uh!

37:06.976 --> 37:08.186
What's going on?
Where the hell is she?

37:08.394 --> 37:10.563
Bellamy, maybe we were
wrong about this.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.858
I don't understand.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.902
Stand down.

37:21.866 --> 37:24.410
Raven, on radio:
Bellamy, Bellamy, come in.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.163
The grounders attacked
mount weather.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.502
What are you
talking about?

37:33.711 --> 37:38.299
It's gone. It's gone.
They're all gone.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.302
Sinclair and I are
the only ones left.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.846
I'm so sorry.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.559
I'm so sorry.

37:55.566 --> 37:58.361
You should have never moved your
people back into mount weather.

37:58.569 --> 38:04.033
The ice nation did what Lexa
was too weak to do.

38:04.242 --> 38:07.620
This is an act of war.

38:07.828 --> 38:11.249
Sentries, arrest the
ice nation delegation,

38:11.457 --> 38:14.126
including the prince.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.003
We need
to get home.

38:16.212 --> 38:18.422
If they attacked
mount weather,

38:18.631 --> 38:19.966
Arkadia
could be next.

38:20.174 --> 38:23.261
- I agree.
- Go. Marshal your forces.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.012
We'll avenge
the attack together.

38:25.221 --> 38:27.515
I'll escort them.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.768
I hope you kept up
your training.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.062
You'll need it.

38:33.271 --> 38:35.273
Clarke,
we need to leave now.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.275
We need an ambassador
from the 13th clan

38:37.483 --> 38:38.484
to stay here in Polis.

38:38.693 --> 38:40.111
It's not safe here.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.155
Clarke will be safe here
under my protection.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.409
I have to stay.

38:46.617 --> 38:47.994
Clarke--

38:48.202 --> 38:50.830
I have to make sure
she keeps her word.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.792
Commander, we must convene
the war council immediately.

38:56.794 --> 38:58.796
I'll be right there.

39:03.843 --> 39:07.346
- Be safe.
- You, too.

39:18.107 --> 39:20.818
She left us to die
on that Mountain.

39:21.027 --> 39:24.488
She will always
put her people first.

39:24.697 --> 39:28.993
You should
come home to yours.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.329
I'm sorry.

39:52.308 --> 39:55.811
Let me know as soon
as the scouts come back.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.984
I hope you know
what you're doing.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.827
I keep
asking myself,

40:12.036 --> 40:13.829
"how did the grounders
know there was

40:14.038 --> 40:16.999
a self-destruct mechanism
inside mount weather?"

40:18.751 --> 40:22.213
We'll get the answer
soon, Clarke.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.298
Thank you
for staying.

40:24.507 --> 40:26.884
I stayed because it was
the right thing for my people.

40:27.093 --> 40:29.929
Our people.

40:30.137 --> 40:33.265
- If you betray me again--
- I won't.

40:45.820 --> 40:49.532
I swear a fealty to you,
Clarke Kom Skaikru.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.909
I vow to treat
your needs as my own

40:52.118 --> 40:54.829
and your people
as my people.

41:43.419 --> 41:45.337
What about Clarke?

41:47.006 --> 41:50.968
By the commander's side,
as predicted.

41:51.177 --> 41:52.803
Your son
is a prisoner.

41:53.012 --> 41:54.180
Not for long.

41:54.388 --> 41:56.932
Soon, he'll be free,

41:57.141 --> 41:59.226
and Lexa
will be dead.
