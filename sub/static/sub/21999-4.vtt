the boy's mother had malaria.

11:19.562 --> 11:20.507
You made it.

11:20.509 --> 11:22.008
That's one way of putting it.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.777
And your boss actually

11:23.779 --> 11:25.912
expects you to come back
with this little boy?

11:25.914 --> 11:28.348
(LAUGHS) Talk about naiveté.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.150
You know, he's here
on an American passport.

Oh, is that why
I can't read any of the signs?

11:36.658 --> 11:39.960
So were you able to get me that,
uh, appointment at the embassy?

the legendary Ron Getman.

He's going to be representing me
in our dispute with Amaya.

12:02.885 --> 12:05.791
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.788
It's an honor, sir.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.156
Well, you got to get out more.

12:09.158 --> 12:11.591
I'm sorry. What...?
What's your name again?

12:11.593 --> 12:13.326
Getman. Ronald Getman.

12:13.328 --> 12:16.029
Ah. Colón. Benjamin Colón.

12:16.031 --> 12:18.165
Colón... that's a pretty-smelling name.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.466
Oh.

12:19.468 --> 12:20.634
I always wanted
a pretty-smelling name, huh?

12:20.636 --> 12:21.768
Who knows?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.937
Maybe next life.

12:25.174 --> 12:27.407
So what do these do?

12:27.409 --> 12:30.310
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.046
BULL: Be right back.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.095
What are you doing?

12:39.097 --> 12:41.221
- What do you mean?
- That guy?

12:41.223 --> 12:43.256
That's who you want
representing you in court?

12:43.258 --> 12:44.457
Yeah, absolutely.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.293
That guy, Ron Getman... he's a shark.

12:46.295 --> 12:47.594
Ron Getman is a killer.

12:47.596 --> 12:51.097
Ah. Yeah, well, your killer
looks like a shoe salesman,

12:51.099 --> 12:53.667
and not a terribly successful one.

12:54.132 --> 12:55.869
Look, I know you're disappointed, I know

12:55.871 --> 12:57.571
you wanted to do this,
but I'm telling you,

12:57.573 --> 12:59.272
we need someone
from the outside... someone,

12:59.274 --> 13:01.608
who, amidst all the Hollywood
glamour that is Amaya,

13:01.610 --> 13:03.743
strikes the jury as authentic.

13:03.745 --> 13:06.346
And people don't get any more
authentic than Ron Getman.

13:06.348 --> 13:07.848
I don't know, Bull.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.283
I've never heard of this guy.

13:10.285 --> 13:13.887
You know, my future's on the line, too.

13:13.889 --> 13:17.023
You lose the business, I lose my job.

13:17.025 --> 13:19.282
I just wish he looked more...

13:19.862 --> 13:22.195
- kempt.
- Well, don't let that fool you.

13:22.197 --> 13:24.397
That man understands the music
of the courtroom better

13:24.399 --> 13:25.966
than anyone I've ever seen.

13:25.968 --> 13:28.702
And, yeah, he's got a reputation

13:28.704 --> 13:31.304
for being not all that user-friendly.

13:31.306 --> 13:33.173
Maybe that's why you've
never heard of him.

13:33.175 --> 13:35.609
But I'm not looking for a friend.

13:36.466 --> 13:38.111
I'm looking for someone to save my life,

13:38.113 --> 13:42.015
and I'm telling you,
he's the guy to do it.

13:43.385 --> 13:47.087
GETMAN: Amaya Andrews
is a lot of things.

13:47.089 --> 13:50.457
She's talented, beautiful,

13:50.459 --> 13:51.758
rich, and,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.927
between you and me,
she's also a spoiled brat.

13:53.929 --> 13:55.862
She's a pampered celebrity

13:55.864 --> 13:59.232
who's used to getting
everything she wants.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.368
And Dr. Jason Bull...

14:01.370 --> 14:03.336
he's got three Ph.D.s,

14:03.338 --> 14:08.074
and 25 years of experience
doing what he does.

14:08.076 --> 14:11.044
He sat down this lady,
and he gave her great advice.

14:11.046 --> 14:15.048
Advice that she was free
to take or leave.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.117
Now, at the time, Amaya,

14:17.119 --> 14:20.820
her attorney and the father
all made an agreement.

14:20.822 --> 14:25.091
Tragically, the father didn't
<i>abide</i> by that agreement.

14:25.093 --> 14:28.295
So spoiled Amaya got mad.

14:28.297 --> 14:30.697
Not at the father
who didn't keep his word,

14:30.699 --> 14:33.333
not at the attorney
who went over the terms

14:33.335 --> 14:37.704
of the deal and told her
to proceed, but at Dr. Bull,

14:37.706 --> 14:41.942
who wasn't even in the room
when everyone shook hands.

14:41.944 --> 14:46.012
Now, Dr. Bull...
he's a lot of things, too.

14:46.014 --> 14:49.215
He's a brilliant man,
he's a good human being,

14:49.217 --> 14:50.684
but guess what?

14:50.686 --> 14:52.218
He's not a fortune teller.

14:52.220 --> 14:55.388
So Amaya is suing him for what?

14:55.390 --> 14:58.024
For not being able to tell the future?

14:58.026 --> 14:59.693
For not being God?

14:59.695 --> 15:01.728
Kind of absurd,

15:01.730 --> 15:03.930
wouldn't you say, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury?

15:03.932 --> 15:05.999
I think you would.

15:07.035 --> 15:08.935
Not that's just the, uh,

15:08.937 --> 15:10.337
gist of it all.

15:10.339 --> 15:12.872
Kind of popped into my head
when I was, uh,

15:13.855 --> 15:16.343
coming over from Brooklyn to here.

15:17.608 --> 15:20.747
That was... very impressive.

15:20.749 --> 15:22.882
Thank you. So, Dr. Genius,

15:22.884 --> 15:24.651
how come there's no bodies
in the chairs?

15:24.653 --> 15:26.853
How are we supposed to run a mock trial

15:26.855 --> 15:28.388
without mock jurors?

15:28.390 --> 15:31.157
Well, unfortunately,
in cases involving celebrities,

15:31.159 --> 15:34.527
mock juries tend
to be fairly unreliable.

15:34.529 --> 15:36.930
Without the presence of
the celebrity herself,

15:36.932 --> 15:38.131
it's virtually impossible

15:38.133 --> 15:40.300
to create the dynamics of the trial.

15:40.302 --> 15:41.868
The data's almost always worthless.

15:41.870 --> 15:44.371
Okay, so what I was
hoping we could do is

15:44.373 --> 15:46.439
kind of come up with a
plan of action, strategy.

15:46.441 --> 15:49.476
Maybe a media campaign
of our own, right?

15:49.478 --> 15:52.545
I mean, as you said,
she's a spoiled brat.

15:52.547 --> 15:54.848
I was thinking we just
turn my team loose.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.916
You haven't met Cable yet,
but give her 48 hours

15:56.918 --> 15:59.252
on the dark web, and she will find dirt

15:59.254 --> 16:01.588
on Little Miss Wonderful
that'll make your hair curl.

16:01.590 --> 16:03.189
Now, once all that stuff

16:03.191 --> 16:06.860
is out there, she is gonna be
<i>running</i> from the media instead

16:06.862 --> 16:09.295
of booking herself on every
show that has the words "the"

16:09.297 --> 16:11.564
and "show" in the title. Actually,

16:11.566 --> 16:14.334
we don't have to look for anything.

16:14.336 --> 16:16.002
Let's just make something up,

16:16.004 --> 16:17.670
because that's basically
what she's done.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.272
And we're not in a court of law.

16:19.274 --> 16:20.640
Nobody's putting their hand on a Bible.

16:20.642 --> 16:22.942
So, we just have to work together

16:22.944 --> 16:25.912
and find the nastiest,
darkest stuff that's out there.

16:25.914 --> 16:27.347
It has to be plausible in the world...

16:27.349 --> 16:28.915
O-O-Okay. Uh, hold on.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.984
What do you mean "we"?

16:32.308 --> 16:33.286
Me.

16:33.288 --> 16:34.988
You, us, the team.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.724
No. I'm sorry.
<i>We</i> don't have to do anything.

16:37.726 --> 16:39.526
Now, are you listening to yourself?

16:39.528 --> 16:43.430
You're so angry right now that
you're borderline certifiable.

16:43.432 --> 16:46.132
Now, I'm-I'm... I'm happy
to work with your team.

16:46.134 --> 16:48.735
I-I could tell
that they're lovely people.

16:48.737 --> 16:51.738
But I'm the lawyer, you're the client.

16:51.740 --> 16:54.407
In the courtroom, there's only
gonna be one quarterback.

16:54.409 --> 16:55.875
And since you're the one
who's being sued...

16:55.877 --> 16:57.310
Okay, hold on a second. This is...

16:57.312 --> 16:58.678
No, no, no, you hold on a second.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.313
Have you ever heard the expression

17:00.315 --> 17:01.881
"doctors make the worst patients"?

17:01.883 --> 17:03.917
You're gonna do more harm than good

17:03.919 --> 17:05.984
if you try to manage this case.

17:05.987 --> 17:08.821
Your judgment is skewed, Dr. Bull.

17:08.824 --> 17:11.023
Let me help you. Let us help you.

17:11.026 --> 17:13.516
With all due respect...

17:14.563 --> 17:17.163
my reputation, my livelihood,

17:17.165 --> 17:19.833
the livelihood of everyone here
depends on this.

17:19.835 --> 17:24.503
And lest we forget, I'm actually
kind of great at this.

17:24.506 --> 17:27.006
I read people better than anyone.

17:27.008 --> 17:29.442
I read juries better than anyone.

17:29.444 --> 17:32.612
You need <i> me</i> to win this case.

17:32.614 --> 17:35.014
I beg to differ, Doc, and frankly,

17:35.016 --> 17:38.384
what I don't need is you acting
like the rash egomaniac

17:38.386 --> 17:41.821
that the prosecution is gonna
paint you to be,

17:41.823 --> 17:44.090
and that's exactly
what you're doing right now.

17:44.092 --> 17:46.059
You want to win?

17:46.061 --> 17:49.162
Sit back, trust your team
and do what I say.

17:49.164 --> 17:51.164
Or else fire me and God bless.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.456
It's up to you.

17:54.036 --> 17:55.802
He's right, Bull.

17:55.804 --> 17:57.704
You're too close to it.

18:00.075 --> 18:03.243
I think we need Mr. Getman
here to call the plays.

18:03.245 --> 18:05.445
Let us do this for you, Bull.

18:14.870 --> 18:16.912
Unfortunately,
there's not a lot we can do.

18:16.914 --> 18:19.289
By breaking the terms
of his settlement with Amaya,

18:19.348 --> 18:20.781
the boy's father broke U.S. law,

18:20.783 --> 18:22.215
but he hasn't broken Ethiopian law.

18:22.217 --> 18:24.217
You've been talking to Harrison.

18:24.219 --> 18:25.852

18:25.854 --> 18:27.554
Ethiopia is a sovereign nation.

18:27.556 --> 18:29.356
State Department has no jurisdiction.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.425
You can't force the
father to do anything.

18:31.427 --> 18:34.127
Only Ethiopian law enforcement
can do that.

18:34.129 --> 18:37.664
Okay, well, maybe you can help
me with the adoption paperwork?

18:37.666 --> 18:39.599
There's virtually nothing
from the Ethiopian side.

18:39.601 --> 18:43.236
I'll make some calls, but... (SIGHS)

18:44.106 --> 18:46.239
Okay, so, what's the next step?

18:46.241 --> 18:48.709
There's got to be an arm you can twist,

18:48.711 --> 18:50.911
a back you can scratch. Look,

18:51.614 --> 18:53.780
I can give you Abel's
last known address,

18:53.782 --> 18:55.615
but beyond that...

18:57.353 --> 18:58.752
It's basically musical chairs.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.253
Benny, you will be riding shotgun

19:00.255 --> 19:02.022
with Mr. Getman at the defense table.

19:02.024 --> 19:03.890
I'll be behind you, uh, in the courtroom

19:03.892 --> 19:05.625
- with the earwig and transmitter.
- Ah.

19:05.627 --> 19:07.728
Does that mean you're gonna wear
the Bull signature glasses, too?

19:07.730 --> 19:11.231
Chunk will man the monitors,
uh, referencing questionnaires

19:11.233 --> 19:13.300
and profiles,
while Cable keeps deep diving

19:13.302 --> 19:15.578
on the Web and social media.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.171
That's me. Deep diving, shallow living,

19:18.173 --> 19:19.539
making my mother proud.

19:19.541 --> 19:21.274
Yeah, that all sounds peachy.

19:21.276 --> 19:23.543
So, uh, what kind of jurors
are we looking for?

19:23.545 --> 19:25.479
Well, as you so beautifully explained

19:25.481 --> 19:27.981
in your opening statement
to our empty chairs,

19:27.983 --> 19:30.817
our narrative is that Bull is human.

19:30.819 --> 19:32.753
His job isn't to see the future.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.488
It's to give the best advice possible

19:34.490 --> 19:36.048
with the information he's given.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.858
Now, for that to work, we need jurors

19:37.860 --> 19:40.193
who can separate certainty from chance,

19:40.195 --> 19:43.063
people who understand that there
are limits to foreseeability,

19:43.065 --> 19:45.432
that choices and outcomes
don't always correlate.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.869
We want to focus on individuals
who judge circumstances

19:48.871 --> 19:51.972
only on the factors
that they can control.

19:53.009 --> 19:54.531
I'm sorry. Was that English?

19:54.533 --> 19:55.409
I-I-I just...

19:55.411 --> 19:57.511
I-I don't know what the hell
she's talking about.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.191
BENNY: Think of, uh,

19:59.792 --> 20:01.156
texting and driving.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.351
Right? It's illegal,
but we've all done it.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.441
Now, you got two people

20:05.443 --> 20:07.097
driving on the same road.

20:07.097 --> 20:09.564
First person finishes their
text, puts their phone away,

20:09.566 --> 20:11.633
keeps on driving. No one's the wiser.

20:11.635 --> 20:13.568
But as the other person
is hitting "send,"

20:13.570 --> 20:15.537
a kid chases a ball onto the street.

20:15.539 --> 20:17.239
The car hits the kid.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.307
Now, is the second person more culpable

20:19.309 --> 20:21.109
than the first because a kid jumped out?

20:21.111 --> 20:23.645
Okay, so what we need
is people that understand

20:23.647 --> 20:26.014
- that sometimes stuff just happens.
- Yeah, exactly.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.817
Well, why didn't you say that
in the first place?

20:28.819 --> 20:30.552

31:44.102 --> 31:46.702
No, she wasn't citing a study.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.905
It was really just...

31:48.907 --> 31:50.773
a personal opinion,

31:50.775 --> 31:53.185
and I didn't think
it was relevant to the case.

31:53.854 --> 31:57.513
Wait a second, she has
a personal opinion about...

31:57.515 --> 32:00.182
the reliability of birth parents

32:00.184 --> 32:03.653
in adoptions
involving third world countries?

32:03.655 --> 32:06.255
No. She has a personal opinion

32:06.257 --> 32:10.493
about the reliability
of birth parents, period.

32:10.495 --> 32:14.063
And it is informed
by personal experience.

32:18.378 --> 32:19.869
And...?

32:19.871 --> 32:22.471
And it's not my story to tell.

32:25.635 --> 32:27.310
You want to save your company?

32:27.763 --> 32:29.812
Do you want to save his job?

32:29.814 --> 32:31.881
Marissa's job?

32:34.485 --> 32:36.886
The man is trying to help you, Bull.

32:39.983 --> 32:43.993
Marissa was adopted from foster care.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.896
But before the adoption was finalized,

32:46.898 --> 32:50.666
her biological mother
came back into the picture.

32:50.668 --> 32:54.737
Just like here.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.167
In Marissa's case,

32:57.608 --> 33:01.677
she was returned to her
biological mother's custody.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.715
Unfortunately...

33:04.515 --> 33:06.343
her mom was a drug addict.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.472
It was not an idyllic childhood.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.524
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.860
We have a winner.

33:17.862 --> 33:22.064
Marissa's judgment was shaped
by her personal history

33:22.066 --> 33:26.335
and not the fact that any
reasonable professional

33:26.337 --> 33:28.437
could have foreseen what happened.

33:28.439 --> 33:31.273
Thank you, Marissa. This is perfect.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.036
You can't use it.

33:34.045 --> 33:35.413
I won't let you.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.125
Excuse me?

33:39.751 --> 33:41.461
Why not?

33:41.953 --> 33:45.054
First of all, it's effective,
and it happens to be true.

33:45.056 --> 33:49.291
Like I said, it's not my story to tell.

33:49.293 --> 33:52.261
It was shared with me in confidence...

33:52.263 --> 33:53.974
years ago.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.900
And it's not like we're in
a position to ask permission.

34:00.805 --> 34:02.805
Bull, do you want to win?

34:02.807 --> 34:05.708
Hmm? Because her testimony out there,

34:05.710 --> 34:08.177
was a knife in the gut.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.146
And if we're gonna survive,

34:10.148 --> 34:12.033
I got to stop the bleeding.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.952
And frankly,
I don't need your permission.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.429
GETMAN: Ms. Morgan,
you said in your e-mail

34:27.431 --> 34:30.331
that birth parents are
notoriously unreliable.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.402
Uh, that knowledge came from where?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.424
I'm sorry. I don't
understand the question.

34:35.426 --> 34:39.975
When you brought up the
notorious unreliability

34:39.976 --> 34:43.312
of birth parents, I'm curious,

34:43.313 --> 34:45.481
how did you become an expert on that?

34:45.483 --> 34:47.149
Have you read studies?

34:47.150 --> 34:48.918
Have you written papers?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.120
What qualifies you to offer

34:51.121 --> 34:53.755
a professional opinion on this?

34:54.326 --> 34:57.259
It wasn't a professional opinion.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.729
GETMAN: Oh, it-it wasn't
a professional opinion?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.497
So that means it was a personal one.

35:01.499 --> 35:05.835
Yes. And in hindsight,
I had no business offering it.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.503
It was completely irrelevant.

35:07.505 --> 35:08.704
Irrelevant,

35:08.706 --> 35:10.606
because it had nothing to do

35:10.608 --> 35:12.942
with Amaya and her adoption,

35:12.944 --> 35:15.778
but everything to do with you.

35:15.972 --> 35:17.480
Correct?

35:20.268 --> 35:22.852
Is it true, Ms. Morgan,

35:22.854 --> 35:26.122
that you grew up in foster care? Hmm?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.423
That just about the time

35:27.425 --> 35:29.024
you were going to be adopted,

35:29.026 --> 35:30.726
your biological mother appeared,

35:30.728 --> 35:32.761
and put the kibosh on it
and you ended up

36:28.747 --> 36:30.314
I don't know.

not for some girl I've never met.

36:37.618 --> 36:40.686
Please. My friend
in Ethiopia really needs

36:40.688 --> 36:42.254
to know what those papers say.

36:43.527 --> 36:44.392
There's a little boy

36:44.394 --> 36:45.490
gone missing.

36:46.730 --> 36:47.993
And my boss

36:47.995 --> 36:50.162
