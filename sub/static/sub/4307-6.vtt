now. Nothing's changed.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.742
[hisses in pain]

11:49.777 --> 11:51.276
[groans]

11:53.447 --> 11:54.913
I sold you out.

11:54.949 --> 11:57.833
Gabriel was right there, and...

11:57.868 --> 12:01.670
It blinded me to anything else.

12:01.706 --> 12:04.757
I screwed up.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.710
You're not the only one.

12:10.715 --> 12:14.216
Julian's looking for you.

12:14.218 --> 12:16.218
The city is sealed. We're trapped.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.303
We need to get out before he kills us.

12:18.355 --> 12:20.806
I know how.

12:20.858 --> 12:22.858
But first, I need fire.

12:24.028 --> 12:26.278
[people shouting]

12:26.313 --> 12:27.730
Thank you!

12:27.782 --> 12:30.199
[shouting]

12:30.234 --> 12:31.400
They've got water!

12:31.402 --> 12:33.235
Wait right here.

12:37.158 --> 12:38.657
Here.

12:40.878 --> 12:42.044
- You ready?
- I just...

12:42.079 --> 12:43.295
my whole life, I've been invisible,

12:43.330 --> 12:44.463
just like all V1s.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.798
I tried to speak but no one listened.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.382
I... [sighs]

12:47.418 --> 12:49.835
Even tried to pray...

12:49.887 --> 12:51.637
but He wasn't there. [sighs]

12:51.672 --> 12:53.088
Huh.

12:53.090 --> 12:55.090
Make them listen.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.981
People of Vega...

13:03.017 --> 13:05.651
We have lived in fear.

13:05.686 --> 13:07.686
My name is Zoe,

13:07.738 --> 13:10.606
and I've given you a new city,

13:10.608 --> 13:12.608
the city we were promised,

13:12.610 --> 13:15.861
a promise broken by the Riesen dynasty,

13:15.913 --> 13:19.915
dictators who made
themselves into new gods.

13:35.099 --> 13:37.216
I lost my family.

13:37.268 --> 13:40.052
I lost everything. We all did.

13:40.104 --> 13:42.604
(man) Listen.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.024
But in Vega, I found a friend.

13:46.060 --> 13:48.944
And now, he's dying because of the V6s,

13:48.979 --> 13:51.063
because of their cruelty.

13:51.115 --> 13:57.035
These walls aren't a
sanctuary. They're a tomb.

13:57.071 --> 14:00.239
Help me.

14:00.291 --> 14:04.159
Help me make it right.

14:04.161 --> 14:09.164
Now... this is our city.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.507
[breathing heavily]

14:20.594 --> 14:22.811
(Zoe, over loudspeaker) People of Vega...

14:22.847 --> 14:25.013
We have lived in fear.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.100
[rock music]

14:28.152 --> 14:30.319
- Thanks.
- Ma'am.

14:30.354 --> 14:32.237
Come on. Do I really need a guard?

14:32.273 --> 14:34.022
Without you, the city would fall.

14:34.024 --> 14:35.691
David knows it. He'll come for you.

14:35.693 --> 14:38.577
Yeah, well, let him try.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.780
I need you sober.

14:41.832 --> 14:43.448
Please tell me you've fixed it.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.500
What, the broadcast?

14:49.874 --> 14:53.508
This city is being torn apart.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.844
You know what? It has been for years.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.180
Your dad created the damn V-System.

14:58.215 --> 14:59.798
Now you're just cleaning up his mess.

14:59.850 --> 15:00.849
But I could've prevented it.

15:00.885 --> 15:01.884
My dad would have executed

15:01.886 --> 15:03.685
David and Zoe in a heartbeat.

15:03.721 --> 15:04.803
I let them live.

15:04.855 --> 15:06.638
Well, that's not who you are.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.307
Maybe it's who I should be.

15:08.359 --> 15:10.025
If I send soldiers in, I can...

15:10.060 --> 15:11.393
Oh, and slaughter innocent people, Claire?

15:11.395 --> 15:15.230
You're not a killer, okay?

15:15.232 --> 15:16.815
I've sent people to their death.

15:16.867 --> 15:20.202
Yeah, traitors. That's different.

15:20.237 --> 15:24.039
You're not a killer. Don't become one.

15:24.074 --> 15:27.409
You can't un-ring that bell.

15:27.411 --> 15:29.912
I'm starting to think about
how much stronger I would be

15:29.914 --> 15:31.997
if I hadn't grown up inside these walls.

15:32.049 --> 15:33.548
But you are.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.167
You know, your dad, he wasn't perfect,

15:35.219 --> 15:39.638
but he took charge when
the people needed a leader.

15:39.673 --> 15:43.225
I had to follow him, but I
want to follow you, Claire.

15:46.430 --> 15:48.313
- Are you hearing this?
- What?

15:48.349 --> 15:50.015
That's Zoe,

15:50.067 --> 15:51.984
speaking to your people.

15:52.019 --> 15:56.966
(Zoe, over loudspeaker)
Now... this is our city.

16:00.071 --> 16:01.743
[grunts]

16:28.021 --> 16:29.437
[loud clattering noise]

16:29.472 --> 16:33.391
- (man) [shouting] Get in here!
- [male voices shouting]

16:33.443 --> 16:36.477
He used an angel to possess my friend.

16:36.530 --> 16:37.812
And you saw him do it?

16:37.864 --> 16:39.614
He has an army of eight-balls.

16:39.649 --> 16:42.617
An army? But for what?

16:42.652 --> 16:46.154
Julian or Lyrae or whatever,
he's got a bone to pick.

16:46.156 --> 16:47.655
Well, he has good reason.

16:47.657 --> 16:50.792
I demoted him, made him into a lower angel.

16:50.827 --> 16:52.493
Now he's found another
body, he'll want revenge,

16:52.529 --> 16:53.962
and he'll get it at all costs.

16:53.997 --> 16:56.216
[loud clattering noise]

16:56.251 --> 16:57.110
_

16:57.145 --> 16:58.692
_

17:01.504 --> 17:03.171
That's it.

17:03.173 --> 17:05.757
That's his revenge. You took his body.

17:05.809 --> 17:08.843
Now he wants to give bodies
to all the lower angels.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.179
New Delphi doesn't have
enough human vessels,

17:11.181 --> 17:12.430
but you know what does?

17:12.482 --> 17:13.598
Vega.

17:13.650 --> 17:14.983
He's gonna attack,

17:15.018 --> 17:16.184
and we have to stop him.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.852
Alex, you're no match for a dyad.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.355
I'm not going to fight him.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.521
I'm going to evict him.

17:21.575 --> 17:22.824
It's never been done.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.358
I don't even know if it would work.

17:24.361 --> 17:26.027
Why would the markings let me evict

17:26.079 --> 17:29.113
unless I was meant to
use them to save humanity?

17:29.165 --> 17:31.449
Riesen can help me distract him.

17:31.501 --> 17:33.368
Yeah, there's a Command Office nearby.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.370
I saw an evacuation hatch inside.

17:35.372 --> 17:36.371
That could be our escape.

17:36.373 --> 17:38.423
I'll meet you there.

17:45.015 --> 17:47.015
[door opening and closing]

17:48.518 --> 17:50.218
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.803
But what's going on out there?

17:51.855 --> 17:52.804
(Alex) I'm going to perform

17:52.856 --> 17:54.389
an eviction on Julian.

17:54.391 --> 17:56.891
When he comes in here,
just keep him talking.

17:56.893 --> 17:58.226
I need his attention off me.

17:58.228 --> 18:00.228
We have one shot at this.

18:02.232 --> 18:04.899
[sighs] I have misjudged you, Alex.

18:04.901 --> 18:09.153
There's something you should know.

18:09.205 --> 18:10.655
We tried to save Clementine.

18:10.707 --> 18:12.240
My wife?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.908
Claire and I performed an eviction,

18:13.960 --> 18:16.044
but it didn't work.

18:16.079 --> 18:18.830
She never made it through. I'm sorry.

18:18.882 --> 18:20.665
Claire said she'd gone.

18:20.717 --> 18:22.834
I just didn't know how.

18:22.886 --> 18:24.502
You were trying to set her free.

18:24.554 --> 18:29.257
I couldn't bring myself to let her go.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.843
She was my Clementine.

18:31.895 --> 18:33.594
[door opening and closing]

18:33.596 --> 18:35.763
Hey, Alex.

18:35.765 --> 18:37.765
- You brought my Amphora?
- Noma has it.

18:37.767 --> 18:40.268
It's on its way, but I
just came to say good-bye,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.353
and to thank you.

18:42.405 --> 18:43.571
You were right.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.941
With Gabriel in chains, Vega is safe.

18:46.993 --> 18:51.279
Well, ah, why don't you
have a drink before you go?

18:51.281 --> 18:53.281
Some of the special stuff.

18:58.621 --> 19:02.206
(Zoe, over loudspeaker) These walls
aren't a sanctuary. They're a tomb.

19:02.258 --> 19:04.759
Help me.

19:04.794 --> 19:07.545
Help me make it right.

19:07.597 --> 19:09.213
I gotta admit, she's persuasive.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.099
She's persuading people
to overthrow my government,

19:11.134 --> 19:12.717
and it's playing on loop. Shut it down.

19:12.769 --> 19:14.385
(Gates) I can't, not from here.

19:14.437 --> 19:16.137
Okay, they're broadcasting
it from a relay station

19:16.139 --> 19:17.972
on their side of the city,
ten blocks behind the trench.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.308
(Arika) But this propaganda
is being heard on both sides,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.277
and the longer it plays, the
weaker your authority looks.

19:23.313 --> 19:25.113
(Gates) There is another way.

19:25.148 --> 19:26.614
Get me across the trench.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.483
I can manually override the broadcast

19:28.485 --> 19:30.568
from the tunnels under the station.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.571
I can cut off her speech,
and play one that you record.

19:33.623 --> 19:35.990
- That's very brave, Mr. Foley.
- No!

19:35.992 --> 19:37.825
It's a war zone. You're
not going over there.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.460
Vega couldn't operate without you.

19:39.496 --> 19:40.995
I am the only one who knows how to do it.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.163
They won't even see me coming.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.664
Just send some soldiers with me.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.083
No, that would attract too much attention.

19:45.135 --> 19:46.918
- Claire, I can go alone...
- Forget it.

19:46.970 --> 19:49.137
Just... find another way.

19:59.015 --> 20:01.015
Nothing here.

20:08.024 --> 20:09.357
I'm gonna need you here
for a couple minutes.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.358
All right, very good.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.193
Find Gates.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.362
Arika.

20:14.364 --> 20:15.830
You were right.

20:15.865 --> 20:17.448
I'm sending soldiers
in to destroy the tower.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.866
(soldier) Lady Riesen? Mr. Foley is gone,

20:18.868 --> 20:20.868
and he left this for you.

20:23.506 --> 20:24.455
(Claire) Gates?

20:24.507 --> 20:25.540
Hello, Claire?

20:25.592 --> 20:27.375
- [rats squeaking]
- Where are you?

20:27.427 --> 20:28.709
(Gates) I'm defying
orders. It's been a while,

20:28.762 --> 20:30.294
so I'm a little out of practice.

20:30.346 --> 20:32.680
- How am I doing?
- You went under the trench?

20:32.715 --> 20:34.048
You're going to the relay station

20:34.100 --> 20:35.466
to stop the signal yourself.

20:35.518 --> 20:37.135
Are you insane? Get back here.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.553
(Gates) No, I'm halfway there.

20:38.555 --> 20:40.638
I'm just about to pass the Venetian.

20:40.690 --> 20:43.474
Or I was. It's sealed off.

20:43.526 --> 20:45.726
- Good. Turn around.
- No.

20:45.779 --> 20:47.645
(Gates) We have to stop that speech.

20:47.697 --> 20:50.031
Gates, I am serious.

20:50.066 --> 20:52.366
I don't care who you are.
You'll be punished for this.

20:52.402 --> 20:54.402
Okay, there's a tunnel up
ahead that'll get me there,

20:54.404 --> 20:56.487
but it's close to the trench.

20:56.539 --> 20:58.539
It's not exactly safe.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.545
Here goes nothing.

21:06.749 --> 21:07.882
Stop.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.220
[sighs]

21:12.255 --> 21:14.388
I know another way.

21:14.424 --> 21:16.757
(Claire) You passed some
graffiti about a mile back, right?

21:16.810 --> 21:19.010
- How'd you know about that?
- Go back to it.

21:19.062 --> 21:20.561
There's a secret passage there,

21:20.597 --> 21:22.180
a stairwell to a lower level.

21:22.232 --> 21:24.015
It's a shortcut to your relay station.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.433
There's no passage there.

21:25.435 --> 21:28.436
(Claire) Not one that you know about.

21:28.438 --> 21:32.440
Okay, I like a woman with
a little mystery, so...

21:32.442 --> 21:35.443
All right, game on. Lead
the way, Lady Riesen.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.286
Stop changing the
bandages. There's no point.

21:45.288 --> 21:47.421
I'm not going to let my best friend die.

21:47.457 --> 21:48.789
Zoe...

21:48.842 --> 21:52.460
Promise me you'll finish what we started.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.019
Double back. Check the tunnels.

22:04.057 --> 22:07.808
[angels speaking indistinctly]

22:07.810 --> 22:10.611
[breathing heavily]

22:10.647 --> 22:11.946
(Julian) He's still in the city.

22:11.981 --> 22:14.232
Don't come back until you find him.

22:14.284 --> 22:16.984
Michael's always been
clever, but we'll find him,

22:17.036 --> 22:18.653
sooner or later.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.739
Tell me, what exactly do you
have in mind for the archangels?

22:21.791 --> 22:23.741
It's complicated,

22:23.793 --> 22:25.141
- but I've got all the time in the world.
- [Alex muttering]

22:25.176 --> 22:28.429
It's one of the perks of
immortality, you see...

22:28.464 --> 22:29.664
Sanctify this vessel!

22:29.716 --> 22:31.499
[disembodied voice growling]

22:31.501 --> 22:33.000
Come into the light.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.969
- [growling]
- Protect us, body and soul.

22:35.004 --> 22:38.973
- [growling]
- [speaking ancient language]

22:43.346 --> 22:44.762
[growling and speaking gibberish]

22:44.814 --> 22:45.854
[speaking ancient language]

22:45.889 --> 22:49.006
Sanctify this vessel! Come into the light!

22:50.737 --> 22:53.020
[growling]

22:53.022 --> 22:54.855
[gasps]

22:54.857 --> 22:57.191
An eviction? Well, would you look at that?

22:57.243 --> 22:59.360
But it's not that easy, Alex,

36:49.016 --> 36:50.932
These are stars in the sky.

36:50.984 --> 36:53.318
It's a constellation called Lyrae.

36:53.353 --> 36:55.604
- What are you talking about?
- And this star.

36:55.656 --> 36:57.656
It's called Vega.

36:59.109 --> 37:01.943
Vega? [sighs]

37:01.995 --> 37:03.945
The markings.

37:03.997 --> 37:06.531
They were trying to warn
me Julian would attack Vega.

37:08.368 --> 37:10.118
It was right there all along.

37:10.170 --> 37:11.536
- Maybe if I'd just listened...
- No, no, no, no.

37:11.538 --> 37:14.039
You couldn't have known. Not on your own.

37:14.041 --> 37:16.625
We were meant to work
together, but I left you.

37:19.212 --> 37:22.631
What's done is done.

37:22.683 --> 37:26.851
Now all that matters is saving
Noma and getting back to Vega.

37:29.222 --> 37:30.438
Come on.

37:30.474 --> 37:33.191
[yells]

37:33.226 --> 37:34.559
Hurry.

37:37.648 --> 37:39.397
I need you to climb for me, okay?

37:39.399 --> 37:40.615
- Keep moving.
- Alex!

37:40.651 --> 37:42.150
Keep climbing.

37:42.202 --> 37:44.869
[groaning]

37:44.905 --> 37:47.405
Noma, go! Move, move!

37:47.407 --> 37:48.707
[pounding]

37:48.742 --> 37:50.542
Alex, go now! Get Noma out!

37:50.577 --> 37:51.960
Noma, go, go, go, go!

37:51.995 --> 37:53.244
[breathing heavily]

37:55.666 --> 37:57.499
Go with her! Julian has an endless army.

37:57.551 --> 37:59.751
- You'll die here.
- I'm not leaving you again.

37:59.753 --> 38:01.970
Then we'll both die, and Vega will be lost.

38:02.005 --> 38:03.722
[pounding and angelic chatter]

38:03.757 --> 38:07.058
This isn't the end. Our fates are tied.

38:07.094 --> 38:09.427
[screeching and snarling]

38:21.358 --> 38:24.275
[panting]

38:24.277 --> 38:26.444
Come on. Come on!

38:26.446 --> 38:27.612
- [growling]
- Don't let go of me.

38:27.664 --> 38:31.032
Come on.

38:31.084 --> 38:35.036
[speaking in ancient language]

38:35.088 --> 38:37.038
Come on, come on.

38:37.090 --> 38:38.623
- [gasping]
- Come here.

38:38.625 --> 38:41.793
Quick, hide. Come on.

38:43.296 --> 38:45.964
Come on, come on.

38:46.016 --> 38:47.599
[angel speaking ancient language]

38:47.634 --> 38:49.050
We've got to keep moving.

38:49.102 --> 38:51.386
Once we get to Vega, you can rest.

38:51.754 --> 38:53.024
_

38:53.388 --> 38:54.388
_

38:54.474 --> 38:55.473
Come on.

38:55.475 --> 38:58.143
[both panting]

38:59.646 --> 39:01.396
You lost Gates.

39:01.448 --> 39:03.148
(David) Whose fault is that?

39:03.150 --> 39:05.984
You might've warned me
about Claire's soldiers.

39:05.986 --> 39:08.653
I'm starting to fear I've
bet on the wrong horse.

39:08.705 --> 39:11.990
[chuckles] No, this stallion's
got plenty of kick in him.

39:12.042 --> 39:14.993
How do you know I won't tell
Claire what you're doing?

39:15.045 --> 39:17.162
[chuckles] Because you need me.

39:17.214 --> 39:19.497
Oh, I seem to be managing just fine.

39:19.549 --> 39:21.416
I think it's you who needs me.

39:21.468 --> 39:24.335
- Why?
- You'll see.

39:31.812 --> 39:33.178
Huh.

39:33.230 --> 39:34.846
I said it would work, didn't I?

39:34.898 --> 39:37.015
You say a lot of things.

39:37.017 --> 39:39.017
Are any of them true?

39:43.851 --> 39:45.413
You said you want to heal Vega,

39:45.448 --> 39:47.040
to make a difference,

39:47.092 --> 39:48.375
but you know what I think?

39:48.427 --> 39:51.461
I think what you really want is to be king.

39:51.513 --> 39:53.630
- Zoe...
- No, I see what you're doing.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.548
You manipulated Claire
and you think you can do

39:55.600 --> 39:57.801
the same to me, and you did.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.602
Jasper's gone because you made me choose,

39:59.638 --> 40:01.638
but I won't be your puppet anymore.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.057
You didn't help me for
me. You did it for you,

40:04.109 --> 40:05.859
and one day you were gonna put a
bullet in my head and take over.

40:05.894 --> 40:06.977
That's what you think, right?

40:07.029 --> 40:08.695
No. I... wait!

40:08.730 --> 40:11.147
But that day's never going to come.

40:11.199 --> 40:12.482
[screams]

40:12.534 --> 40:15.436
[screaming]

40:15.471 --> 40:18.905
When the V1s stole food,
you would chop off our hands.

40:18.957 --> 40:21.875
This is for Jasper. You stole him from me.

40:21.910 --> 40:24.995
And now you'll never
point a gun at me again.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.312
[groaning]

40:26.348 --> 40:29.833
Because I'll put a bullet
in your head if you do.

40:39.678 --> 40:41.561
We should never have left that
Amphora back in New Delphi.

40:41.596 --> 40:42.846
It was a mistake.

40:42.898 --> 40:45.315
It was either save the Amphora or save you.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.984
Wasn't a choice.

40:48.020 --> 40:50.020
That choice could destroy my kind.

40:52.107 --> 40:53.857
We need to get inside that house.

40:53.909 --> 40:57.193
- Buy some time.
- We both know I don't have any.

40:57.245 --> 40:58.695
I'm not healing, Alex.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.747
Something's changed. I'm dead weight now.

41:00.782 --> 41:03.166
Nothing's changed. We'll figure it out.

41:03.201 --> 41:04.951
You're not listening to me.

41:05.003 --> 41:07.420
I'm dying. I can feel it.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.175
You're the one not listening.

41:16.465 --> 41:17.630
What?

41:19.184 --> 41:22.602
N-nothing. Nothing, nothing.

41:22.637 --> 41:24.804
Come on.

41:36.985 --> 41:38.201
Aah!

41:43.992 --> 41:45.492
[gasps]

41:53.969 --> 41:57.220
We need a needle and thread, matches.

41:57.255 --> 41:59.139
There's a town nearby.

41:59.174 --> 42:03.726
We'll rest an hour,
and then we'll head out.

42:03.762 --> 42:06.012
You're gonna be okay, Nomes.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.983
Julian!

42:17.325 --> 42:19.776
Get your rest.

42:19.828 --> 42:22.112
You're gonna need it.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.563
[whistles]

42:27.113 --> 42:28.402
[door closes]

42:29.602 --> 42:31.097
Michael?
