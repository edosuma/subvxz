<i>There are mountaintop experiences</i>

00:46.896 --> 00:49.158
<i>in our journey through this world...</i>

00:54.363 --> 00:59.126
<i>those rare and lucid moments
when everything seems right...</i>

01:01.030 --> 01:02.621
<i>and anything is possible.</i>

01:06.663 --> 01:08.391
<i>There are those ordinary days</i>

01:08.496 --> 01:12.793
<i>when we may not be thrillingly aware
of what lies in the future...</i>

01:15.363 --> 01:17.330
<i>but we know it's still out there.</i>

01:25.129 --> 01:27.062
<i>There are also those strange times</i>

01:27.162 --> 01:30.357
<i>when things do not add up or make sense.</i>

01:32.830 --> 01:37.627
<i>We sit and wait for an answer
that will seemingly never come.</i>

01:41.730 --> 01:45.356
<i>But it's all the moments, good and bad...</i>

01:46.363 --> 01:48.057
<i>that make up a life.</i>

01:53.696 --> 01:56.629
<i>And the most important thing
to do with life...</i>

01:59.863 --> 02:01.295
<i>is to live it.</i>

02:16.029 --> 02:17.553
Where do I put this box down?

02:17.663 --> 02:19.289
In the kitchen, please.

02:20.696 --> 02:23.483
- Benjamin, darling, stay in the yard.
- Yes, Mum!

02:23.563 --> 02:25.449
# Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall #

02:25.529 --> 02:27.283
# Humpty Dumpty had a great fall #

02:27.363 --> 02:28.352
# And all the... #

02:29.863 --> 02:33.590
- Babe, you want this in the bedroom?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

02:36.996 --> 02:38.554
You talk funny.

02:38.663 --> 02:40.149
What's your name?

02:40.229 --> 02:42.059
Uh, Ben.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.391
We just moved here from England.

02:44.496 --> 02:47.019
Does everybody there talk funny?

02:47.129 --> 02:48.316
Not to me.

02:48.396 --> 02:49.316
Ava, dinner!

02:49.396 --> 02:50.556
Yes, ma'am.

02:50.663 --> 02:51.686
<i>That's where we began...</i>

02:51.796 --> 02:52.694
See ya!

02:52.796 --> 02:54.854
<i>Ava and me.</i>

02:54.962 --> 02:58.054
<i>That's the moment that changed my life.</i>

03:09.196 --> 03:11.449
Ben! You know, you can't
hide from me for long.

03:11.529 --> 03:13.949
- I'm pretty good at finding...
- Ahh!

03:14.029 --> 03:16.783
Ugh, you're such a little dork.

03:16.863 --> 03:20.227
One day, I'm gonna sail this boat for real.

03:22.162 --> 03:23.151
Then I'm coming with you.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.190
Only if you beat me to the house.

03:26.296 --> 03:29.116
- Hey! You bring me that back!
- You're not gonna get me, Ava!

03:29.196 --> 03:31.026
<i>As we grew up, all those years
of play and make-believe</i>

03:32.496 --> 03:35.156
<i>became something more...</i>

03:36.296 --> 03:38.126
<i>something real...</i>

03:40.296 --> 03:44.195
<i>something wow.</i>

03:44.296 --> 03:45.449
Charlie, get out of the way.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.462
Come here. Come here. All right, ready?

03:51.463 --> 03:52.657
Dance with me?

04:12.830 --> 04:14.387
Michael's gonna get you both fired.

04:14.496 --> 04:17.053
<i>Yeah, well, he'll never
be able to be employed</i>

04:17.161 --> 04:21.449
by anyone who's not relationally
obligated to hire him, that's for sure.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.616
<i>I miss you.</i>

04:22.696 --> 04:24.283
I miss you, too.

04:24.363 --> 04:26.149
But I'm gonna see you next week.

04:26.229 --> 04:28.815
Okay. I'm sleepy.

04:28.895 --> 04:30.116
I love you.

04:30.196 --> 04:31.449
<i>I love you, too.</i>

04:31.529 --> 04:33.553
Night, babe.

04:33.663 --> 04:34.561
Ah, there you go.

04:34.663 --> 04:35.782
Yeah.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.193
Hi. What can I get for you?

04:37.296 --> 04:39.650
Um, I'm gonna have a hazelnut latte, please.

04:39.730 --> 04:41.060
Sure.

04:41.162 --> 04:43.061
<i>Un café au laut, s'il vous plaît.</i>

04:43.162 --> 04:44.561
Yeah, sure.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.626
- Thank you.
- 10 even.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.391
You do that to them on purpose.

04:50.496 --> 04:52.616
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:52.696 --> 04:55.727
- I'll go get us a table.
- Stay out of trouble.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.319
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:58.329 --> 05:02.693
And one grande hot cocoa, extra whip cream,
marshmallows, two pumps vanilla.

05:02.796 --> 05:04.650
- Yep, that's me. Thank you.
- Hey, you.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.219
Ava, hey.

05:06.329 --> 05:07.483
- Sweet tooth?
- Yeah.

05:07.563 --> 05:09.316
It's like Christmas in a cup.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.949
So how'd you do on the quiz last week?

05:11.029 --> 05:13.949
Pretty good. Like a 96, I think.

05:14.029 --> 05:16.616
- 96. Wow.
- You?

05:16.696 --> 05:18.889
Uh, I did, you know, pretty good.

05:18.996 --> 05:20.019
I'm up six points.

05:20.129 --> 05:22.187
- Nice, onward and upward.
- Yeah.

05:22.296 --> 05:24.229
I guess I'll still see you
in study group next week.

05:24.329 --> 05:27.728
Yes, you will. Uh, look, I gotta run,
but I'll catch you later?

05:27.829 --> 05:29.228
Okay, yeah. See you later.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.786
Thank you.

05:35.563 --> 05:36.530
That's yours.

05:36.630 --> 05:37.815
- Is that...
- Who?

05:37.895 --> 05:41.316
Who? The Adonis you were just talking to?

05:41.396 --> 05:43.650
What, David? He's just in my study group.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.316
Is there room for one more
in the study group?

05:46.396 --> 05:48.283
No, because you are not in the class.

05:48.363 --> 05:49.982
Well, I see something I can study.

05:50.062 --> 05:52.949
Yeah, I bet you do. Good gracious, girl.

05:55.829 --> 05:58.116
<i>Between my job at the limo service</i>

05:58.196 --> 06:00.856
<i>and interning at my father's
architecture firm...</i>

06:01.962 --> 06:03.154
<i>it was a busy time.</i>

06:04.162 --> 06:05.220
Okay.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.455
Drive fast. We're in a hurry.

06:13.296 --> 06:14.982
You, too. Okay.

06:15.062 --> 06:16.051
Yeah.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.657
Yeah, it's great. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:22.363 --> 06:25.228
Look, Ben. Got me a quarter.

06:25.329 --> 06:30.319
<i># Movin' in the city #</i>

06:36.029 --> 06:37.018
To Washington.

06:38.996 --> 06:41.483
Uh, that's 400 miles away.

06:41.563 --> 06:43.052
We pay you big money.

06:47.829 --> 06:52.525
<i># Movin' in the city #</i>

06:55.829 --> 06:57.949
- What is that?
- Dude, do you hear that?

06:58.029 --> 06:59.621
- Dude...
- What is she doing?

07:00.696 --> 07:01.855
Dude.

07:01.962 --> 07:03.293
Is she crying?

07:04.496 --> 07:05.690
Dude, I think she's crying.

07:06.729 --> 07:08.219
Aw, man.

07:08.329 --> 07:09.727
This is you. This is you, man.

07:09.829 --> 07:10.982
- I'm not doing... I can't.
- This is all you.

07:11.062 --> 07:12.116
I can't. I can't.

07:12.196 --> 07:15.785
He's not a... Nah, this is not...

07:18.229 --> 07:22.219
She had the nerve to say it's my fault?

07:22.329 --> 07:25.057
That it's... That it's my...

07:25.162 --> 07:27.152
I know.

07:38.962 --> 07:40.156
Ava.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.316
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

07:45.396 --> 07:46.449
Where's everybody else?

07:46.529 --> 07:48.316
Uh, I guess we're the only ones.

07:48.396 --> 07:50.192
Oh. Okay.

07:50.296 --> 07:54.615
Um, well, what'd you think about
what he covered in class today?

07:54.695 --> 07:56.483
Um, I don't really know what he was saying,

07:56.563 --> 08:00.116
but I did doodle an excellent
monkey with a top hat.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.186
- Okay.
- Heh.

08:02.296 --> 08:04.229
We clearly have a lot to go over.

08:04.329 --> 08:06.316
I am playing around. Look.

08:06.396 --> 08:09.227
I actually took your advice,
and I did take a few notes.

08:09.329 --> 08:10.318
Okay.

08:11.895 --> 08:13.815
Yeah, you look pretty good.

08:13.895 --> 08:16.483
You think so? You know,
red's not normally my color,

08:16.563 --> 08:19.649
but I think this one actually...
you know, it's just dull enough.

08:19.729 --> 08:22.026
Uh, I'm sorry.

08:22.129 --> 08:24.187
I...I was talking about your notes.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.815
Yeah, I know.

08:26.895 --> 08:28.149
Uh, all right, well...

08:28.229 --> 08:29.982
- Uh, chapter seven.
- Yeah.

08:30.062 --> 08:32.291
Chapter... Chapter seven.

08:34.029 --> 08:35.553
I mean, what page are you even on?

08:35.662 --> 08:37.782
Okay, here. Just look on mine.

08:37.861 --> 08:40.352
Okay, look. So right here in this speech

08:40.462 --> 08:43.395
that Petruchio gives, classic narcissist.

08:43.496 --> 08:45.520
...a little stiff whenever he moves.

08:45.629 --> 08:47.721
- It's not a medical condition.
- Is that...

08:47.829 --> 08:49.728
- You know it's a toupee, right?
- Stop.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.228
Yeah, it's not so bad.

08:51.329 --> 08:53.949
It's not. It's great.

08:54.029 --> 08:56.116
You know, you should really be a teacher.

08:56.196 --> 08:57.649
That's actually what I want to be.

08:57.729 --> 08:59.356
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:59.463 --> 09:03.352
So listen, don't go skipping class tomorrow
just 'cause you stayed up all night

09:03.463 --> 09:04.982
- partying hard in the library.
- I don't know.

09:05.062 --> 09:09.093
I'm gonna have a pretty bad old book
and dirty carpet smell hangover.

09:09.496 --> 09:12.782
All right, well, you know, take
two aspirin, and call me in the morning.

09:12.862 --> 09:13.988
Yeah?

09:16.563 --> 09:18.359
Well, hey, thanks for walking me back.

09:18.463 --> 09:19.782
Yeah, of course.

09:19.862 --> 09:21.726
Okay.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.149
I'll see you.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.389
- See you later.
- All right.

09:40.363 --> 09:41.693
Hey.

09:41.795 --> 09:43.615
<i>Hey. Uh, didn't expect you to answer.</i>

09:43.695 --> 09:45.219
<i>I was just going to leave a message.</i>

09:45.329 --> 09:46.727
No, I'm up.

09:46.829 --> 09:48.649
<i>Okay. Well, good news.</i>

09:48.729 --> 09:50.649
<i>I got the weekend off.</i>

09:50.729 --> 09:52.253
For real this time?

09:52.695 --> 09:54.482
You want to get out of here?

09:54.562 --> 09:56.722
Don't you have some project
to do or something?

09:56.829 --> 09:58.149
Yeah, but you been slacking.

09:58.229 --> 10:00.149
Well, some might say slacking.

10:00.229 --> 10:01.389
Others might say delegating.

10:01.496 --> 10:03.149
It's kind of a potato, a <i>potahto.</i>

10:03.229 --> 10:05.219
Why don't you just take off?
I'll worry about locking up.

10:05.329 --> 10:07.482
Okay, what is with you, man?

10:07.562 --> 10:09.029
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"

10:09.129 --> 10:10.720
You've been in a bad mood
for, like, a month now,

10:10.829 --> 10:12.557
and I gotta tell you
I'm getting a little sick of it.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.815
I'm not in a bad mood.

10:13.895 --> 10:16.316
Okay, yeah. You're right.

10:16.396 --> 10:18.022
You're not in a bad mood at all.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.782
I'm sorry. It's just Ava's mad at me again,

10:24.862 --> 10:26.982
because I haven't made it up there
for weeks, and I...

10:27.062 --> 10:29.188
I don't know. I can't not work,
not go to school.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.782
So, dude, why do you put up with it?

10:30.862 --> 10:31.782
Because I love her, man.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.522
I know, but...

10:33.629 --> 10:36.721
it just seems like
a lot of work for true love.

10:36.829 --> 10:38.557
Yeah, well, you don't understand.

10:38.662 --> 10:40.982
Heh. You are right.

10:41.062 --> 10:43.029
I do not understand.

10:44.962 --> 10:46.982
Was wondering, however,
about the French girl.

10:47.062 --> 10:48.482
Go home, Mikey.

10:48.562 --> 10:49.982
I'm just wondering about the French friend.

10:50.062 --> 10:51.551
- It's two hours away.
- Two hours is nothing.

10:51.662 --> 10:54.027
Two hours is a road trip,
and, you know, you always say

10:54.129 --> 10:55.391
- that Ava wants to come visit.
- Go home.

10:55.495 --> 10:56.894
And I wouldn't worry about two hours.

10:56.996 --> 10:58.116
- You're ridiculous.
- 'Cause this old dog,

10:58.196 --> 11:00.186
he can howl at the moon all night.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.482
I mean...

11:04.562 --> 11:07.359
- Go home!
- Baby, I can do it all night!

11:17.729 --> 11:19.615
Sorry I'm late.

11:19.695 --> 11:20.855
You look great.

11:20.962 --> 11:21.951
Thank you.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.988
Let's just go. I'm starving.

11:33.229 --> 11:34.991
So how's your internship going?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.291
Good.

11:38.296 --> 11:39.728
Busy.

11:39.829 --> 11:43.149
But one of the lead architects took one
of my designs, so that was awesome.

11:43.229 --> 11:44.218
That's great.

11:47.129 --> 11:48.891
And the, uh, chauffeur job?

11:50.495 --> 11:52.649
Michael gets on my last nerve.

11:52.729 --> 11:54.026
Some things never change.

11:59.729 --> 12:04.026
So Monique went to this art show
last week at some gallery downtown.

12:04.129 --> 12:06.392
This photographer is supposed to be amazing,

12:06.495 --> 12:08.649
and apparently he's gonna
be there tomorrow night,

12:08.729 --> 12:10.982
and she was able to get us tickets, so...

12:11.062 --> 12:12.782
Oh, that sounds so great, babe.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.782
Um, but...

12:16.262 --> 12:19.390
- I can't believe I forgot to tell you this.
- What?

12:19.495 --> 12:22.019
I have to cover the late shift
at De Luca's tomorrow night.

12:22.729 --> 12:25.361
Are you kidding me?
Ben, I thought we had the whole weekend.

12:25.462 --> 12:28.362
I know. We did. This just came
at the last minute.

12:28.462 --> 12:31.482
One of the guys couldn't do it,
and somebody had to cover.

12:31.562 --> 12:34.560
That's fine. It's fine. Since you didn't
have any plans with anyone important,

12:34.662 --> 12:36.482
I guess it was no big deal
for you to cover, right?

12:36.562 --> 12:38.482
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- Don't be like what?

12:38.562 --> 12:40.392
What, you want to tell me
how I should be now?

12:40.495 --> 12:41.949
You know what?
Actually, why don't you tell me

12:42.029 --> 12:43.223
what would work best for you, huh?

12:43.329 --> 12:45.886
Since we're all apparently operating
off of your schedule right now.

12:45.996 --> 12:47.690
Ava, can you calm down? People are looking.

12:47.795 --> 12:49.853
I don't care if they're looking.
Let 'em look. God.

12:49.962 --> 12:51.224
- Can I get you...
- I'll have the duck.

12:51.329 --> 12:52.556
Sure you want to commit to that, Ben?

12:52.662 --> 12:55.482
You may not have time to finish it,
given your busy schedule and all.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.223
I'll have the slow-roasted chicken.

13:10.996 --> 13:13.156
Well, thanks for a really great night.

13:14.395 --> 13:16.521
Yeah, totally worth the two-hour drive.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.116
Well, I don't know why you
came in the first place,

13:18.196 --> 13:19.685
since you knew you didn't have
the whole weekend.

13:19.795 --> 13:22.228
Well, I thought I was coming
to see my loving girlfriend,

13:22.328 --> 13:23.615
but obviously she's not around.

13:23.695 --> 13:25.026
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's around.

13:25.129 --> 13:27.949
Oh, she's just waiting around all the time,
'cause that's all she does now.

13:28.029 --> 13:29.448
- Don't put that on me.
- What?

13:29.528 --> 13:31.392
You never come back to see me.
I'm always the one

13:31.495 --> 13:32.860
that has to drive up here to see you.

13:32.962 --> 13:36.482
Half the time when I call you, you're out
with your friends, and you can't talk anyway,

13:36.562 --> 13:39.382
so don't act like a victim
sitting around all lonely.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.392
Where are you going?

13:41.495 --> 13:44.553
- This isn't working, Ben!
- What are you saying?

13:44.662 --> 13:47.448
I'm saying that you don't care
about us like you used to!

13:47.528 --> 13:49.448
I don't feel like
I'm important to you at all!

13:49.528 --> 13:51.018
- I don't care about us?
- No!

13:51.129 --> 13:52.949
I'm the one who has to build
his entire schedule

13:53.029 --> 13:55.315
around coming up here for us.
Okay, I'm not a lap dog.

13:55.395 --> 13:57.149
I can't just come at your beck and call.

13:57.229 --> 13:59.025
I have responsibilities, Ava.
We're not kids anymore.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.649
Oh, okay. You're right.
You're right. I'm so sorry.

14:01.729 --> 14:03.949
I always expect you to come to me, don't I?

14:04.029 --> 14:08.116
But maybe that's because you always
tell me that you're coming, so I don't know.

14:08.196 --> 14:10.615
Crazy me, I actually believe you.

14:10.695 --> 14:12.448
You want to talk about responsibilities,

14:12.528 --> 14:15.615
Ben, relationships are a part of that.
They require work.

14:15.695 --> 14:17.448
Yeah, well, maybe if we're
really supposed to be together,

14:17.528 --> 14:19.189
I wouldn't have to work so hard at it.

14:19.295 --> 14:21.229
Oh. Sorry you're so tired.
Then maybe we should

14:21.328 --> 14:23.057
just take a break from all this hard work.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.287
Maybe we should.

14:27.029 --> 14:28.149
Fine.

14:28.229 --> 14:29.218
Good night.

14:37.662 --> 14:41.229
Augh! I don't know. I guess I just feel

14:41.328 --> 14:43.482
like his priorities have changed, you know?

14:43.562 --> 14:47.782
Well, then you either sit down
and "talk about it." Enh.

14:47.862 --> 14:49.815
Or you change your priorities, too.

14:49.895 --> 14:51.315
- Oh, that's your advice?
- <i>Oui.</i>

14:51.395 --> 14:53.482
Yeah, Monique Marceau, relationship guru.

14:53.562 --> 14:56.189
<i>Oui.</i> Very smart.
I will bill you for my time later.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.929
No, please don't. You're too expensive.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.727
<i>Oui.</i> French advice
is very expensive these days.

15:01.829 --> 15:04.123
- I could not afford you.
- No more this.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.315
Okay.

15:06.395 --> 15:07.726
You know, I'm not calling her.

15:07.829 --> 15:09.557
Nah, don't call her. What are you gonna do?

15:09.662 --> 15:11.356
Gonna call her? You're a single guy.

15:11.462 --> 15:12.949
Enjoy it. Being single's awesome.

15:13.029 --> 15:15.282
Exactly. I haven't been single in...

15:15.362 --> 15:16.282
ever.

15:16.362 --> 15:17.649
Prime of your life, man!

15:17.729 --> 15:20.982
We are free, wild men. We're animals.

15:21.062 --> 15:22.282
- Yeah.
- We're free men.

15:22.362 --> 15:23.982
- She could call me.
- What are you gonna...

15:24.062 --> 15:26.688
You're not gonna call her.
What are you gonna do, call her?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.482
- You're not gonna call her.
- She can call me.

15:28.562 --> 15:30.282
She can... Yeah.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.282
I mean, with that being said, though...

15:32.362 --> 15:35.057
- What?
- It's nothing. It's just...

15:35.162 --> 15:36.282
I don't know.

15:36.362 --> 15:39.023
Just kind of seems like a waste
to throw it all away.

15:39.129 --> 15:40.857
What... What are you talking about?

15:40.962 --> 15:44.394
It's like you said, if it's supposed
to be, then it shouldn't be so hard.

15:44.495 --> 15:45.393
- Who said that?
- You did.

15:45.495 --> 15:47.118
- I said that?
- Yeah.

15:47.629 --> 15:50.448
Okay. Well, that's your
first mistake right there.

15:50.528 --> 15:54.689
Never listen to anything I say,
because I'm very rarely right.

15:54.795 --> 15:56.989
I've never been in love.
I mean, what do I know?

15:58.395 --> 16:00.362
The thing is, it's just...

16:00.462 --> 16:04.520
I don't think it's about whether
it's hard work or not, right?

16:04.629 --> 16:07.115
It's whether it's worth it.

16:07.195 --> 16:11.027
You just gotta ask yourself is it worth it?

16:14.528 --> 16:16.282
- You still owe me one.
- What, I owe you?

16:16.362 --> 16:18.282
- I thought you were buying.
- I thought you were buying.

16:18.362 --> 16:20.115
That's the whole reason I agreed to do it.

16:20.195 --> 16:21.685
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

16:22.795 --> 16:24.448
I saw this band two years ago,

16:24.528 --> 16:25.949
- and they were incredible.
- No way.

16:26.029 --> 16:28.727
I tried to get tickets to that, and they
were sold out, like, immediately.

16:28.829 --> 16:29.982
I camped out for, like, three days.

16:30.062 --> 16:32.694
I didn't shower. It was disgusting,
but it was totally worth it.

16:32.795 --> 16:34.649
First thing he does, Kevin comes onstage,

16:34.729 --> 16:38.060
and he's wearing this, like,
rock god V-neck jumpsuit, right?

16:38.161 --> 16:39.649
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
- And he puts his hands

16:39.729 --> 16:41.282
on his keyboard, and he's like,

16:41.362 --> 16:45.525
"All right, all you lovers out there,
are you ready to rock?"

16:46.629 --> 16:49.727
I know. I can't make it sound
as cool as they do, you know?

16:49.829 --> 16:51.728
Like, you... you have to love the Brits.

16:51.829 --> 16:52.887
Yeah, you do.

16:58.862 --> 17:01.693
I'm sorry. I... I gotta go.

17:02.729 --> 17:03.649
You okay? You...

17:03.729 --> 17:04.982
Yeah. I just...

17:05.061 --> 17:06.688
gotta go.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.886
She's cute.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.323
I don't want to take a break.

17:46.495 --> 17:47.723
You were right.

17:47.829 --> 17:49.386
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:49.495 --> 17:51.724
You are important.
You're the most important thing,

17:51.829 --> 17:55.115
and I want to make this work, no matter what,

17:55.195 --> 17:56.890
no matter how hard.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.622
I love you.

18:07.862 --> 18:11.488
Can we please go see that French girl now?

18:13.029 --> 18:14.448
Guys, I'm dying back here.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.518
<i>I'd almost lost her.</i>

18:16.629 --> 18:18.815
<i>I decided that I wasn't
gonna let that happen again.</i>

18:18.895 --> 18:20.725
Yeah, no, that's cool.

18:20.829 --> 18:23.148
<i>That spring, Ava graduated</i>

18:23.228 --> 18:25.388
<i>and got a job back home
teaching second grade.</i>

18:26.362 --> 18:29.295
<i>I was brought on full-time
at my dad's architecture firm.</i>

18:31.061 --> 18:33.119
<i>Things were almost perfect.</i>

18:36.629 --> 18:38.482
Thank you.

18:45.528 --> 18:46.670
What is this?

18:57.795 --> 18:59.694
"Bossiness."

19:36.845 --> 19:38.669
Shut up!

19:40.395 --> 19:41.315
Is that a yes?

19:41.395 --> 19:43.115
Yeah.

19:43.195 --> 19:44.389
Oh, my gosh.

20:07.495 --> 20:09.394
Oh, thank you. Wow.

20:16.061 --> 20:17.187
It's just us.

20:18.095 --> 20:19.653
Just us is okay.

20:32.862 --> 20:36.981
<i>I thought people said the first few
years of marriage were hard.</i>

20:37.061 --> 20:38.148
<i>We didn't see it that way.</i>

20:38.228 --> 20:39.388
- Oh. Upstairs.
- Okay.

20:39.495 --> 20:41.953
- Oh, God.
- Careful.

20:42.462 --> 20:47.315
- Oh, is that funny? Is that funny, is it?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

20:47.395 --> 20:49.952
Have you gotten to meet
any of the artists yet or anything?

20:52.462 --> 20:53.451
Tickles.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.360
Ben, I'm on the phone.

20:59.462 --> 21:01.053
- You kicked me.
- Sorry, Monique.

21:01.161 --> 21:02.782
Ben's messing with me again.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.624
Calm down.

21:06.061 --> 21:08.358
So which one's yours?

21:08.462 --> 21:09.948
Ta-da.

21:10.028 --> 21:12.689
Wow. It's nice, Ben.

21:12.795 --> 21:14.056
What do you think?

21:14.161 --> 21:18.615
Gosh, I just...
I love this color of... of beige.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.685
And it's very square.

21:22.795 --> 21:24.948
Well, it's a start.

21:25.028 --> 21:27.359
Very impressive, Mr. Morton.

21:29.028 --> 21:31.482
You gonna be much longer, Mr. Morton?

21:31.562 --> 21:34.051
Um, getting very close to wrapping it up.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.386
So what you been working on?

21:40.828 --> 21:42.193
Wow.

21:43.195 --> 21:44.115
Ben, that's...

21:44.195 --> 21:45.889
that's really fantastic.

21:47.395 --> 21:50.362
Well, it's not finished, but it's a start.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.462
Yeah, it is.

21:56.462 --> 21:57.448
Let's get out of here.

21:57.528 --> 21:58.654
Okay.

22:00.228 --> 22:01.482
Ben!

22:01.562 --> 22:02.858
Yeah?

22:02.961 --> 22:04.860
Could you come up here for a second?

22:09.528 --> 22:10.448
What's up?

22:10.528 --> 22:12.392
Um, look at this place.

22:13.395 --> 22:14.827
Yeah, I was gonna get it.

22:17.562 --> 22:19.115
I don't think it's that big a deal.

22:19.195 --> 22:20.615
It's just a few clothes.

22:20.695 --> 22:23.855
There's a wet towel on the bed.
That's disgusting.

22:23.961 --> 22:25.053
- Come on.
- Oh.

22:25.161 --> 22:26.615
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, that's bad.

22:26.695 --> 22:28.559
- No, I don't want to smell it.
- That is so bad.

22:28.662 --> 22:30.890
Stop! Stop.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.282
It's not that bad.

22:33.362 --> 22:35.115
- It is bad. No...
- It's really not that bad.

22:35.195 --> 22:36.315
I'm mad at you. Stop.

22:36.395 --> 22:37.448
- It's disgusting.
- Oh, come on.

22:37.528 --> 22:38.948
- Come on. Come on.
- No.

22:39.028 --> 22:40.282
Did you miss me?

22:40.362 --> 22:41.522
- No.
- Oh!

22:41.629 --> 22:45.357
<i>Eventually, we decided it was time.</i>

22:53.828 --> 22:56.148
It's all right. It's only been a few months.

22:56.228 --> 22:58.127
I know. I was just hoping.

23:00.562 --> 23:03.824
Well, we're just gonna have to try harder.

23:12.195 --> 23:15.148
Oh, Mr. Morton, uh, your father said
he wanted to see you when you arrived.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.525
Am I grounded?

23:20.362 --> 23:23.559
The design you submitted for the Victory
project has been chosen by our clients.

23:23.662 --> 23:25.148
You're taking the lead on this one.

23:25.228 --> 23:27.814
What... What does this mean, exactly?

23:27.894 --> 23:31.723
An office with a view
for one thing, a bump in pay,

23:31.828 --> 23:35.448
but, Benjamin, this is also going to mean
more commitment on your part.

23:35.528 --> 23:38.814
The, uh, clients came back with quite
a few additions to the initial design.

23:38.894 --> 23:42.482
They're going to need you
to be available 24/7,

23:42.562 --> 23:44.648
which means longer hours, late nights,

23:44.728 --> 23:47.854
but, son, this is the one.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.315
Yes, sir, absolutely.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.315
- I'm... I'm their guy.
- I know you are.

23:53.395 --> 23:56.648
We'll have a GoToMeeting conference
later this afternoon to introduce you,

23:56.728 --> 23:59.525
and we'll have, uh, our first meeting
in their offices in New York

23:59.629 --> 24:01.814
to discuss the additions next Thursday.

24:01.894 --> 24:04.315
They'll want to see some new plans by then.

24:04.395 --> 24:05.384
We leave Wednesday night.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.787
Yes, sir. Wednesday night.

24:16.129 --> 24:17.459
Wednesday.

24:18.629 --> 24:19.720
Baby date, don't forget!

24:26.894 --> 24:31.055
Hi. Brenda, can you see
if Cerulean does takeout for dinner?

24:31.161 --> 24:32.219
Thanks.

24:32.328 --> 24:34.148
Ben, I'm so glad you're home.

24:34.228 --> 24:38.051
I just had the worst parent-teacher
conference of my life.

24:38.161 --> 24:40.390
Seriously, how do you still defend your kid

24:40.495 --> 24:43.648
when the holes from where he was
throwing his scissors are still in the wall?

24:43.728 --> 24:45.286
It's unbelievable.

24:46.495 --> 24:48.648
- Ben!
- In the dining room, love!

24:48.728 --> 24:51.282
Oh. Why are the doors closed?

24:51.362 --> 24:53.381
Welcome to Chateau Morton.

24:53.661 --> 24:55.551
Wow, look at you.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.890
What's the occasion?

24:57.995 --> 24:59.360
So something happened today.

24:59.462 --> 25:01.860
- Okay.
- Just come sit down first.

25:01.961 --> 25:03.981
Uh, what'd you do?

25:04.061 --> 25:05.814
No, it's nothing bad.

25:05.894 --> 25:07.327
Nothing like that.

25:08.362 --> 25:13.781
But today my father told me
that the Victory clients

25:13.861 --> 25:16.315
have chosen my design
for their new expansion.

25:16.395 --> 25:17.981
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:18.061 --> 25:20.687
I mean, it... it is gonna be
a little more travel for me...

25:20.794 --> 25:21.886
- Okay.
- ...but it's... that's nothing

25:21.995 --> 25:23.448
- we can't handle.
- Why travel?

25:23.528 --> 25:24.892
I thought the expansion was here.

25:24.995 --> 25:27.519
It is, but their corporate office
is in New York,

25:27.628 --> 25:30.855
so I... Well, actually, I have to go there
next week for a little kickoff meeting.

25:30.961 --> 25:32.394
Oh. When next week?

25:32.495 --> 25:35.448
Uh, that's the thing.
I have to go on Wednesday.

25:35.528 --> 25:37.119
Oh. Okay.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.482
I mean, it's... Yeah. I mean,

25:39.562 --> 25:43.185
it should just be a week here or there,
and we'll... we'll make it work.

25:43.295 --> 25:45.315
Sure. Yeah. Honey, I'm...

25:45.395 --> 25:47.725
- Hey, I'm happy for you.
- Are you sure?

25:47.828 --> 25:49.523
Because I know that we...
You know, we were supposed to...

25:49.628 --> 25:51.061
Don't be silly, okay? It's like you said.

25:51.161 --> 25:52.355
It's just a little here and there.

25:52.462 --> 25:54.814
We have plenty of time, okay?

25:54.894 --> 25:58.482
I just... I'm really proud of you, babe.

25:58.562 --> 25:59.892
Cheers.

25:59.995 --> 26:01.648
Cheers.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.648
I love you.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.218
I love you.

26:05.661 --> 26:07.890
<i>But I didn't make it work.</i>

26:07.995 --> 26:10.614
<i>I let time get away from me, from us.</i>

26:10.694 --> 26:12.389
...concrete that's coming,
and it needs to have been set.

26:14.295 --> 26:15.284
Go time.

26:16.528 --> 26:20.325
<i>The demands of work became overwhelming.</i>

26:22.061 --> 26:24.687
<i>I lost track of the schedule
Ava had made for us.</i>

26:24.794 --> 26:26.448
I'm sorry. I just...

26:26.528 --> 26:28.814
I really gotta sleep.

26:28.894 --> 26:30.724
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

26:30.828 --> 26:33.448
I have... Let me tell it to you.

26:33.528 --> 26:34.721
...appreciate that, but that...

26:34.828 --> 26:36.386
To be honest, that's not my problem.

26:41.061 --> 26:44.981
The second phase could be ready
to kick off in as early as three months.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.187
That's great news. Thank you.

26:46.295 --> 26:47.814
Uh, if you guys have a minute, though,

26:47.894 --> 26:50.481
I think my colleague and I have
a few questions about the layout.

26:50.561 --> 26:52.721
So do you got the plans
in front of you right now?

26:52.828 --> 26:54.988
Of course we do.
We have all the time in the world.

26:56.561 --> 26:57.892
Sure. Let's take a look.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.628
<i>Even worse...</i>

27:02.328 --> 27:04.124
<i>I lost track of what was important.</i>

27:11.161 --> 27:12.150
Hey.

27:13.362 --> 27:15.352
What are you still doing up?

27:16.628 --> 27:18.527
You were supposed to be home hours ago.

27:18.628 --> 27:20.720
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

27:20.828 --> 27:22.481
Just the Victory guys wanted to...

27:22.561 --> 27:25.648
Oh, my gosh, if I have to hear
that word one more time...

27:25.728 --> 27:28.148
Ben, do you... do you realize
you have not kept

27:28.228 --> 27:30.524
one night we have had together
for the last two months?

27:30.628 --> 27:33.221
- Yeah, I know, but...
- No buts.

27:33.328 --> 27:35.556
Ben, if you're not ready, then just tell me,

27:35.661 --> 27:37.560
but don't leave me sitting here,

27:37.661 --> 27:40.219
waiting for you, like, to make time for me.

27:40.328 --> 27:43.115
Why do you think I'm slaving away like this?

27:43.195 --> 27:44.814
I mean, what do you think I'm working for?

27:44.894 --> 27:46.622
I'm trying to build a better life for us.

27:48.694 --> 27:51.355
You want to make a better life for me?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.814
Be in it.

27:52.894 --> 27:55.315
That's all I need, but you're not here.

27:55.395 --> 27:58.948
And I'm happy that you have
this project going.

27:59.028 --> 28:00.481
Really, I am.

28:00.561 --> 28:03.528
I just also feel like it's tearing you
away from me

28:03.628 --> 28:07.115
and everything that we've talked about
wanting together.

28:07.195 --> 28:08.321
It's...

28:16.461 --> 28:17.792
You're right.

28:19.362 --> 28:20.851
Ava, look at me.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.321
You're right.

28:26.828 --> 28:30.353
I mean, I got so caught up
in this opportunity,

28:30.461 --> 28:32.485
and I didn't want to let anybody down...

28:33.961 --> 28:35.614
and I did.

28:35.694 --> 28:37.661
I let you down...

28:39.995 --> 28:41.484
and I'm so, so sorry.

28:46.161 --> 28:47.718
I just miss you.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.661
Yeah. I've missed you, too.

28:58.961 --> 29:00.481
I'm glad you're home.

29:00.561 --> 29:01.781
Yeah.

29:01.861 --> 29:05.282
<i>I realized that while I was working
toward a better life,</i>

29:05.362 --> 29:08.022
<i>I was losing perspective.</i>

29:09.295 --> 29:10.852
<i>Ava was right.</i>

29:10.961 --> 29:14.190
<i>The way to a better life
was to do it together.</i>

29:14.295 --> 29:16.648
- Hey, cutie.
- Hey, you.

29:16.728 --> 29:20.321
- No coffee this morning?
- No.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.218
You seem cheerful.

29:24.527 --> 29:26.981
I've never seen you even crack
a smile before having your coffee.

29:27.061 --> 29:28.550
- Do I?
- Yeah.

29:28.661 --> 29:31.356
Uh, yes, you seem...

29:31.461 --> 29:33.860
hmm, different. What is going on?

29:35.295 --> 29:36.648
Something came for you.

29:36.728 --> 29:39.161
Might want to check that out.

29:42.995 --> 29:43.984
Are you...

29:45.661 --> 29:46.559
Are... Are we...

29:46.661 --> 29:48.389
Are we gonna...

29:48.494 --> 29:49.722
Yeah, we're gonna.

29:51.527 --> 29:53.314
Oh! Careful. There's a baby in there.

29:53.394 --> 29:55.225
Oh, there's a baby in there!

29:56.195 --> 29:58.481
You are amazing.

29:58.561 --> 30:00.721
I love you. How...
Cheeky thing. How did you...

30:00.828 --> 30:02.614
I just couldn't wait to tell you. I'm sorry.

30:02.694 --> 30:04.059
How am I supposed to go to work now?

30:04.161 --> 30:06.148
- Well, don't
- Oh, I wish. I wish.

30:06.228 --> 30:08.353
I'm already so late. I've gotta go.

30:09.628 --> 30:12.061
- Oh, I love you.
- Me, too.

30:12.161 --> 30:14.148
Okay. Ooh, ooh, jacket.

30:14.228 --> 30:15.854
Got it.

30:15.961 --> 30:17.223
- Love you.
- Love you.

30:17.327 --> 30:18.521
We're gonna have a baby!

30:18.628 --> 30:19.720
I know! Ha ha ha!

30:20.061 --> 30:21.148
Hey, Zach.

30:21.228 --> 30:22.558
Morning.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.654
Morning, grandpa.

30:36.327 --> 30:38.022
- Mr. Morton...
- Brenda.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.356
Oh! Good morning, Mr. Morton.

30:40.461 --> 30:42.515
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

30:50.661 --> 30:52.026
We're gonn...

30:52.128 --> 30:53.719
I can't even sa...

30:53.828 --> 30:55.314
- What?
- No, no, no.

30:55.394 --> 30:57.148
It's probably too early
to say anything. I'm...

30:57.228 --> 30:59.024
Let me talk to Ava and see how she feels.

30:59.128 --> 31:00.481
I have to tell your mother.

31:00.561 --> 31:01.781
Okay, Mum, but that's it.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.381
Yeah?

31:03.861 --> 31:05.148
We're gonna have a baby.

31:05.228 --> 31:07.148
God. Oh, my God.

31:07.228 --> 31:08.948
Your life is about to get so complicated.

31:09.028 --> 31:10.814
I can't even tell you.
It's gonna be wonderful.

31:10.894 --> 31:12.814
- Are you ready to be a father?
- I don't know. I'm not ready.

31:12.894 --> 31:14.115
- Of course you're not ready.
- Are you ready?

31:14.195 --> 31:15.481
- I'm gonna be a grandfather.
- Yeah.

31:15.561 --> 31:16.528
I'm gonn... I'm gonna spoil them blind.

31:16.628 --> 31:17.720
I'm going to spoil them blind.

31:17.828 --> 31:19.692
<i>Between my parents and Ava's,</i>

31:19.794 --> 31:23.228
<i>that secret didn't keep long.</i>

31:23.327 --> 31:25.521
<i>Pretty soon, even our mailman knew.</i>

31:25.628 --> 31:29.481
<i>But there was still one very important
person to share the good news with.</i>

31:29.561 --> 31:32.148
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

31:32.228 --> 31:34.281
I can't believe you're here.
You look amazing.

31:34.361 --> 31:36.648
Me? You look <i>magnifique.</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:37.948
I made tea. Do you want some?

31:38.028 --> 31:40.018
Uh, <i>oui, s'il vous plaît.</i>

31:40.128 --> 31:41.814
Awesome.

31:41.894 --> 31:43.614
So how long you in town?

31:43.694 --> 31:45.147
Until Sunday.

31:45.227 --> 31:47.058
What? No, that's not long enough.

31:47.161 --> 31:48.648
- Stay longer.
- Ah, no.

31:48.728 --> 31:53.225
My boss is already not very understanding
that I took an impromptu trip to the States.

31:53.327 --> 31:55.147
I'll just be a sec.
Hey, love. I left my wallet.

31:55.227 --> 31:56.147
- Hey.
- Hey, look who's here.

31:56.227 --> 31:57.814
Ah! Monique, you made it.

31:57.894 --> 32:00.191
- You made it.
- Benjamin.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.281
What? What is this?

32:02.361 --> 32:04.314
Um, Mo's staying till Sunday, 'kay?

32:04.394 --> 32:07.225
- Sure. Sounds great.
- It's the girl of my dreams.

32:07.327 --> 32:09.614
- Michel.
- If I knew you were coming,

32:09.694 --> 32:11.888
I would have worn, you know, my good shorts.

32:11.995 --> 32:13.552
You should see me in my work uniform.

32:13.661 --> 32:15.781
Did she tell you that I'm running
the limo business now?

32:15.861 --> 32:18.814
It's no big deal. It's like
a boss man kind of thing.

32:18.894 --> 32:20.020
That's nice.

32:20.128 --> 32:23.648
Mo, Mo, Mo, let me ask you a question.

32:23.728 --> 32:25.059
I don't think American girls get me.

32:25.161 --> 32:26.614
That's not a question.

32:26.694 --> 32:30.314
You, being a sophisticated, dare I say it,

32:30.394 --> 32:33.648
extremely beautiful French mademoiselle...

32:33.728 --> 32:35.217
- Wow.
- ...it must be true

32:35.327 --> 32:41.717
that you are truly educated in the fine
art of love, if you know what I'm saying.

32:41.828 --> 32:43.351
- Come on, Mike. Let's go.
- And furthermore...

32:43.461 --> 32:45.519
- This is a two-part question.
- Let's leave Monique

32:45.628 --> 32:47.781
to teach my wife about the fine art of love.

32:47.861 --> 32:49.055
I think we're having
a bit of a rapport, actually.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.814
- Oh, really? Uh-huh.
- Bye, love.

32:50.894 --> 32:52.614
Bye. Get him out of here, please.

32:52.694 --> 32:54.281
- I was getting eyes from her.
- You were not.

32:54.361 --> 32:56.351
- Serious eye action. She's...
- Unbelievable.

32:56.461 --> 32:58.553
- Some things never change.
- I know.

32:59.961 --> 33:01.218
He's not grown up at all.

33:01.327 --> 33:04.781
So... catch me up.

33:04.861 --> 33:06.521
Where were we?

33:08.661 --> 33:14.561
Well, um, I know that I sort of
sprung this trip on you,

33:14.661 --> 33:16.787
but I needed my best friend.

33:18.327 --> 33:19.350
What's up?

33:23.561 --> 33:25.051
I'm pregnant.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.650
What?

33:27.828 --> 33:29.556
He was an artist.

33:29.661 --> 33:33.219
He had a showing at my gallery,
and we just sort of hit it off.

33:34.227 --> 33:35.387
I don't know.

33:35.494 --> 33:37.893
I really thought it was going somewhere.

33:37.995 --> 33:40.114
I thought we were in love,

33:40.194 --> 33:42.114
and now he's gone,

33:42.194 --> 33:44.684
and I, um...

33:46.728 --> 33:48.648
I don't know.

33:48.728 --> 33:49.888
I don't know what to do.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.518
I haven't told anyone.

33:51.628 --> 33:55.391
I just... I had to tell you,
because you are my best friend,

33:55.494 --> 33:57.948
and I can't imagine doing this without you.

33:58.028 --> 33:59.017
Mo...

34:01.028 --> 34:03.147
Okay.

34:03.227 --> 34:04.147
Okay, look at me.

34:04.227 --> 34:05.447
Hey.

34:05.527 --> 34:08.051
You are gonna be fine.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.614
Okay? You know that, right?

34:10.694 --> 34:15.525
Yeah, and this baby is gonna be so loved.

34:17.127 --> 34:20.281
And Ben and I, we are here for you,
whatever you need.

34:20.360 --> 34:24.226
I actually have something
I wanted to ask you.

34:24.327 --> 34:25.851
Um...

34:25.960 --> 34:28.688
the baby is going to need godparents.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.281
Well, of course.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.726
Gosh, I insist, actually.

34:38.761 --> 34:39.813
<i>Merci.</i>

34:39.893 --> 34:42.690
I mean, plus it'll be nice
that whenever you come visit,

34:42.793 --> 34:46.318
they'll have a playmate
that's about the same age.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.023
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

34:52.226 --> 34:53.853
- Ava.
- I know.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.359
I'm so happy for you.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.451
I'm happy for you.

35:09.661 --> 35:11.184
Are you gonna turn the light off?

35:11.294 --> 35:13.887
Mm, no. I'm already in bed.

35:15.194 --> 35:19.355
Yeah, I know, love,
but you left the light on... again.

35:20.527 --> 35:21.781
Oh, you're closer.

35:21.861 --> 35:24.851
Will you please just go turn it off?

35:24.961 --> 35:27.481
Oh, I'm not closer.

35:30.494 --> 35:32.484
Every night.

35:36.494 --> 35:38.358
Yeah, yeah, the ones from the... Yeah.

35:38.461 --> 35:40.325
The Christmas party. Mm-hmm.
Where'd you get those?

35:41.494 --> 35:44.357
Well, righ... No, I went to the store,
and I couldn't find them anywhere.

35:44.461 --> 35:47.114
All they had was, like, the multicolored
ones, and I was looking for some

35:47.194 --> 35:50.814
for the party that I'm doing at school.

35:50.894 --> 35:53.224
No, Wednesday. Uh-huh.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.020
You have my wife?

36:04.127 --> 36:05.481
- Morton. Ava Morton?
- Okay. Calm down.

36:05.561 --> 36:07.050
- Ava!
- Ben.

36:08.628 --> 36:10.185
Ah, honey.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.314
Mr. Morton, I'm Dr. Robbins.

36:13.394 --> 36:16.558
I'm very sorry to say this,
but your wife has suffered a miscarriage.

36:20.327 --> 36:21.648
I'm so sorry.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.648
- No, no.
- She seems healthy otherwise.

36:23.728 --> 36:25.747
Um, I would advise...

36:35.461 --> 36:38.314
Just get those reports to the team today.

36:38.394 --> 36:42.658
Make sure of it. Everybody needs to be on
the same page before the groundbreaking.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.290
Just... Brian, hold on.
I'm getting another call.

36:49.060 --> 36:50.288
Hello.

36:52.194 --> 36:53.183
Speaking.

36:59.327 --> 37:01.351
Is there a problem?

37:01.461 --> 37:04.018
We've received the results of your bloodwork.

37:04.794 --> 37:08.648
I have a serious concern
regarding your HCG level.

37:08.728 --> 37:11.224
There are several reasons we could
be seeing numbers this high,

37:11.327 --> 37:14.980
but one of the more common ones, especially
in levels as high as yours are reading,

37:15.060 --> 37:18.147
is linked to the presence of malignant cells.

37:18.227 --> 37:21.717
Now, we're not gonna jump to any conclusions

37:21.828 --> 37:24.447
until we've run more tests.

37:24.527 --> 37:26.813
Well, you just get right
to the point there, don't you?

37:26.893 --> 37:28.614
- I'm sorry?
- Uh, no, I'm sorry.

37:28.694 --> 37:30.813
What does all this mean?

37:30.893 --> 37:34.224
Mr. Morton, your wife's tests are showing
some very irregular levels.

37:34.327 --> 37:37.314
I'm recommending a CT scan
for further diagnosis

37:37.394 --> 37:39.947
as well as some other routine bloodwork.

37:40.027 --> 37:41.221
Once we've done more thorough testing,

37:41.327 --> 37:45.351
I'll be able to better explain to you
the realities of your wife's situation.

37:45.461 --> 37:49.717
Mrs. Morton, I've scheduled a CT scan
for you at the hospital today at 5:00.

37:49.828 --> 37:52.226
Okay, but this is probably nothing, right?

37:52.327 --> 37:54.556
This is all just a precaution?

38:25.294 --> 38:26.954
Let's go home.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.991
<i>The test results proved our worst fears.</i>

38:33.994 --> 38:38.447
<i>We caught it early enough,
so treatment was a viable option.</i>

38:38.527 --> 38:39.891
Are you ready?

38:49.728 --> 38:51.147
We are.

38:51.227 --> 38:53.147
All right. I'll be right back
to check on you.

38:53.227 --> 38:54.524
Thanks.

38:57.327 --> 38:58.658
You got this.

39:01.194 --> 39:02.820
We got this.

39:06.893 --> 39:08.224
<i>This was our life.</i>

39:10.127 --> 39:14.058
<i>Over the next month, I watched
the strongest girl I know endure the worst.</i>

39:19.893 --> 39:21.690
<i>There was nothing I could do to stop it.</i>

39:24.728 --> 39:27.224
<i>She plastered a smile on her face and...</i>

39:28.027 --> 39:29.358
<i>...fought through it.</i>

39:30.461 --> 39:31.519
A sonogram.

39:31.628 --> 39:32.947
I can't believe her.

39:33.027 --> 39:34.241
<i>But I could tell.</i>

40:14.860 --> 40:17.123
Ava, I'm home, love.

40:19.327 --> 40:20.521
Ava?

40:22.960 --> 40:24.052
Ava?

40:25.127 --> 40:27.719
Honey? What's wrong?

40:31.661 --> 40:33.947
Ava, honey, what's happened?

40:34.527 --> 40:35.720
What...

40:35.827 --> 40:36.816
Come on. Sit down.

40:40.793 --> 40:43.488
Why is this happening to us?

40:46.394 --> 40:48.520
I hate it! I hate it.

40:48.628 --> 40:50.060
I know.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.025
I can't... It killed our baby.

40:53.127 --> 40:57.322
I just... I want it out of me.

40:58.628 --> 41:00.947
I know, honey, but...

41:01.027 --> 41:03.017
we are gonna beat this.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.025
Okay?

41:04.127 --> 41:06.617
If anybody can do it, you can.

41:08.994 --> 41:10.858
And you know what?

41:10.960 --> 41:12.052
I love you.

41:13.060 --> 41:15.459
Not your hair, you.

41:19.127 --> 41:20.650
I love you, too.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.052
I really like my hair.

41:30.194 --> 41:31.547
I know.

42:11.461 --> 42:13.147
Was that a bad idea?

42:14.793 --> 42:16.226
No.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.226
It looks really good, actually.

42:19.327 --> 42:20.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.656
You're not doing this alone.

42:28.494 --> 42:32.780
<i>Even though we were still in the storm,
somehow we would find joy.</i>

42:32.860 --> 42:33.849
Thank you.

42:36.827 --> 42:41.147
<i>We changed our perspectives,
and the world changed around us.</i>

44:24.994 --> 44:28.789
What does a fella have to do
to get a blanket around this place?

44:30.327 --> 44:34.147
Well, how is everyone feeling today?

44:34.227 --> 44:35.980
Food's terrible here.

44:36.060 --> 44:40.147
Well, I will be sure to include that
in my report.

44:40.227 --> 44:41.319
Please do.

44:46.693 --> 44:48.980
Why do I feel like when he comes in here,

44:49.060 --> 44:51.446
we're being summoned
to the principal's office?

44:51.526 --> 44:53.857
- I know.
- Do you think he ever smiles?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.047
No, I don't think he's programmed for it.

44:57.994 --> 45:00.654
<i># This life for me is hard #</i>

45:01.660 --> 45:03.355
<i># 'Cause I'm #</i>

45:03.460 --> 45:06.053
<i># Living in the dark #</i>

45:07.693 --> 45:08.613

<i># And all of my life #</i>

45:24.361 --> 45:27.691
<i># Has come down to this one day #</i>

45:27.793 --> 45:29.385
- <i># Where I go #</i>
- 'Cause I'm not so much...

45:29.493 --> 45:31.188
- <i># To stare in the face #</i>
- Hey, I'm here.

45:31.294 --> 45:32.885
- Hey.
- How was your night?

45:32.994 --> 45:35.188
- Okay.
- # All of my regrets #

45:35.294 --> 45:36.352
Look at that.

45:38.060 --> 45:40.613
Oh, she's so sweet.

45:40.693 --> 45:43.387
<i># But I wouldn't change a thing #</i>

45:43.493 --> 45:45.722
- Say hi to Auntie Ava.
- <i># No #</i>

45:45.827 --> 45:48.555
<i># 'Cause I know that I've seen #</i>

45:48.660 --> 45:50.889
<i># Seen your hand #</i>

45:50.994 --> 45:53.223
- Look at you.
- <i># Working in me #</i>

45:53.327 --> 45:54.446
Hey, baby.

45:54.526 --> 45:56.980
<i># To restore the pain... #</i>

45:57.060 --> 45:58.390
Oh, what's up, hot stuff?

45:58.493 --> 46:00.858
Oh, I'm digging the new hair, babe.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.613
Really?

46:04.294 --> 46:07.647
You know, I do hear that blues have more fun.

46:07.727 --> 46:09.024
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

46:09.127 --> 46:10.025
Oh! Not so fast.

46:10.127 --> 46:11.814
Oh! Oh, come on.

46:14.660 --> 46:16.718
Oh, you are crazy.

46:16.827 --> 46:19.021
Oh, you... you are crazy.

46:19.127 --> 46:21.213
Mm-hmm, about you.

46:22.227 --> 46:23.980
Oh, babe.

46:24.060 --> 46:24.980
Oh, yeah?

46:25.060 --> 46:26.049
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.683
Yeah, I am gonna rock your world.

46:27.793 --> 46:29.313
- Oh, really?
- Come here.

46:29.393 --> 46:31.980
Do you all know why they call us patients?

46:32.060 --> 46:34.647
Because they expect us to be patient.

46:34.727 --> 46:36.557
Well, I'm not gonna be patient. Well...

46:36.660 --> 46:40.354
Hard work. Hard work.

46:41.793 --> 46:44.114
Finally said something I agree with.

46:46.027 --> 46:48.721
All right, there we go.

46:48.827 --> 46:50.555
- Ohh.
- Oh, hold on, honey.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.114
- Let me get the...
- Thank you.

46:52.194 --> 46:54.854
I can't believe you guys.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.551
Look at this feast.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.559
Thank you.

46:58.660 --> 47:01.059
It should be really good. Ben.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.980
- Okay.
- Well, I was there.

47:03.060 --> 47:04.480
- I was...
- Yeah, right.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.114
- Yes, I've been in the kitchen.
- Yeah, right.

47:06.194 --> 47:08.024
- I mean, I'm a technical...
- Yeah.

47:08.127 --> 47:09.114
Dad, will you bless it?

47:09.194 --> 47:10.683
Oh, absolutely.

47:17.627 --> 47:20.185
What's up, my chemo-sabes?

47:20.293 --> 47:22.351
- Hey, girl, how are you?
- Oh, hey.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.189
Feeling okay.

47:25.293 --> 47:26.280
I am.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.991
Okay, you ready?

47:28.393 --> 47:29.480
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.857
- Thanks, Melanie.
- Mm-hmm.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.147
- See you guys later.
- Thank you.

47:34.227 --> 47:35.386
Where's Ben today?

47:35.493 --> 47:37.147
Oh, he had a big meeting at work.

47:37.227 --> 47:40.387
Yeah. Gary has the kids today.

47:40.493 --> 47:41.687
They went to a birthday party.

47:41.793 --> 47:42.987
Heh.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.027
Ava, I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

47:48.693 --> 47:51.280
No. I'm sorry.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.313
Just we were...

47:54.393 --> 47:56.690
we were pregnant right before.

47:57.693 --> 47:59.557
Ava, I'm so sorry.

47:59.660 --> 48:01.780
It's okay. You... You couldn't have known.

48:01.860 --> 48:03.554
It's fine.

48:05.326 --> 48:08.147
I just really wanted to be a mom.

48:08.227 --> 48:11.023
Oh, honey, of course.

48:11.127 --> 48:13.780
Maybe you still can be.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.849
Not after all this.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.223
You never know. Nothing is impossible.

48:18.326 --> 48:20.280
There's more than one way to be a mom.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.123
No, it'll be okay.

48:23.127 --> 48:24.114
Promise.

48:24.194 --> 48:25.319
Thank you.

48:33.693 --> 48:36.058
Mrs. Morton. Mrs. Morton.

48:37.627 --> 48:38.650
Merry Christmas.

48:40.727 --> 48:42.126
Got your latest results back.

48:44.727 --> 48:46.313
Okay.

48:46.393 --> 48:48.553
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know how to read these.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.456
Well, basically it says
I better never see you here again.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.183
Merry Christmas.

48:57.793 --> 48:59.623
Does that mean we're clear?

49:00.660 --> 49:01.813
Didn't I say "Merry..."

49:01.893 --> 49:03.313
I thought I said "Merry Christmas."

49:11.860 --> 49:13.020
Oh.

49:13.127 --> 49:14.821
Dr. Sumrall.

49:17.393 --> 49:18.792
Thank you.

49:21.627 --> 49:24.117
<i>The chains that had been
binding us were gone.</i>

49:25.627 --> 49:26.992
<i>We had a second chance...</i>

49:28.127 --> 49:29.059
<i>a fresh start.</i>

49:29.159 --> 49:30.780
You were the best one here!

49:30.860 --> 49:34.293
<i>We were back.</i>

49:37.727 --> 49:40.387
Okay, those are this week's
arithmetic problems.

49:40.493 --> 49:43.446
You guys be sure you copy them
all down correctly, please.

49:43.526 --> 49:46.146
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

49:46.226 --> 49:48.853
<i>Ava was happier than I had ever seen her.</i>

49:53.293 --> 49:55.851
<i>She was stronger, brighter.</i>

49:55.960 --> 49:58.647
Have a good summer, Mrs. Morton.
You're my favorite teacher.

49:58.727 --> 50:01.146
Oh, thank you very much.
You have a good summer, too.

50:01.226 --> 50:04.446
<i>Year after year, we celebrated
as her tests came back clear.</i>

50:04.526 --> 50:05.720
Hey.

50:09.526 --> 50:10.823
How much do you love me?

50:11.827 --> 50:12.816
What?

50:13.827 --> 50:15.691
How much do you love me?

50:17.560 --> 50:19.027
You know the answer to that.

50:22.360 --> 50:25.021
Well, tell me anyway.

50:28.627 --> 50:32.146
Well, I could have yelled at you this morning

50:32.226 --> 50:34.280
for leaving your wet towel
on the bed, but I didn't,

50:34.360 --> 50:36.813
so I think that's a pretty good indication.

50:36.893 --> 50:37.947
Caught.

50:38.027 --> 50:39.857
You know what I mean.

50:42.793 --> 50:44.123
Benjamin Morton...

50:45.193 --> 50:47.480
I love you very much.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.356
- Well, that's a good thing.
- Yeah.

50:49.460 --> 50:51.984
Because this is nonrefundable.

50:54.660 --> 50:57.357
I know you miss her. Go and see her.

50:57.460 --> 50:59.280
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.280
Oh, my gosh!

51:01.360 --> 51:03.725
Mm! Mm! Thank you! Thank you!

51:03.827 --> 51:06.384
Thank you! Thank you!
I have to go call her! Whoo!

51:07.526 --> 51:09.480
Huh. I love you, too, by the way.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.891
I love you!

51:14.827 --> 51:15.947
What's all that?

51:16.027 --> 51:18.280
Stuff for the trip.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.554
I thought the whole idea of going to Paris

51:20.660 --> 51:21.854
was to shop there.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.647
Ooh, I will. Don't you worry about me.

51:24.727 --> 51:27.057
What's this? It's very cute.

51:27.159 --> 51:30.524
Thank you. It's for Noey.
She's gonna love it, right?

51:34.526 --> 51:38.280
Noey's learning English.
She is so crazy smart.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.725
I mean, she's not even three yet,

51:39.827 --> 51:42.113
and she already knows
a bunch of words and just...

51:42.193 --> 51:44.780
She's amazing. They're so happy.

51:44.860 --> 51:47.884
- I'm glad you had a good time.
- I did. Thank you.

51:50.894 --> 51:55.020
Wow, I'm full. Oof. We should have
just shared that crème brûlée.

51:55.126 --> 51:59.647
Well, I think we ordered it to share,
but somehow I just never got a bite.

51:59.727 --> 52:02.580
Hmm. I don't feel
like I remember it like that.

52:03.326 --> 52:05.384
Oh, my gosh, but speaking of food,

52:05.493 --> 52:07.613
babe, did I tell you about what we ate?

52:07.693 --> 52:09.853
Okay, I know you know I can eat,

52:09.960 --> 52:13.146
but I'm telling you, in France, I can eat.

52:13.226 --> 52:17.146
There are, like, crepes
on every corner on the street,

52:17.226 --> 52:19.113
and the cheese. My gosh,

52:19.193 --> 52:22.946
I could have survived
the whole trip on just cheese...

52:23.026 --> 52:24.721
- Hey.
- ...and bread. Hmm?

52:24.827 --> 52:26.813
That boat, what does that say?

52:26.893 --> 52:30.018
Heh. You need glasses already, old man?

52:30.126 --> 52:31.354
Come on.

52:33.460 --> 52:34.780
Oh, <i>"Je T'aime."</i>

52:34.860 --> 52:37.224
It's French. It means, "I love you."

52:37.326 --> 52:38.384
Yeah, I thought so.

52:38.493 --> 52:39.613
You did, huh?

52:39.693 --> 52:40.853
That's the boat.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.187
What boat?

52:42.293 --> 52:44.385
Ava, come on. The boat.

52:44.493 --> 52:48.858
Don't you remember that old boat that used
to be stuck on the docks near our houses?

52:48.959 --> 52:50.187
It had that same name.

52:50.293 --> 52:52.113
I think that's the same one.

52:53.193 --> 52:55.979
Wow. That's... That's unbelievable.

52:56.059 --> 52:59.480
That's... That, if I remember correctly, sir,

52:59.560 --> 53:02.550
is the boat that you were going
to sail around the world.

53:02.660 --> 53:04.647
Only if you were going with me.

53:04.727 --> 53:06.694
I'd go anywhere with you.

53:07.860 --> 53:09.850
- Huh.
- Come on.

53:09.959 --> 53:10.948
Okay.

53:15.460 --> 53:16.518
Yoo-hoo!

53:16.627 --> 53:19.059
Birthday boy, wakey-wakey.

53:19.659 --> 53:21.058
Ava, what are you doing?

53:21.159 --> 53:23.146
Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

53:23.226 --> 53:24.193
It's your birthday.

53:24.293 --> 53:25.692
Nuh-uh. Let me sleep some more.

53:25.793 --> 53:27.384
Ben, I got a live fire going here.

53:27.493 --> 53:29.551
Can you please just get up
and blow out your candle?

53:31.026 --> 53:33.357
Can I make a wish to sleep a bit longer?

53:34.393 --> 53:35.382
So...

53:36.727 --> 53:38.523
Attaboy. Ohh!

53:38.627 --> 53:40.218
What is...

53:48.226 --> 53:49.454
What are you up to?

53:50.460 --> 53:52.188
Come on.

53:52.293 --> 53:55.520
I hope there's not just a hundred people
out here looking at me in my boxers.

53:55.627 --> 53:57.313
Whole neighborhood. That's the gift.

53:57.393 --> 53:58.690
- Oh, gravel.
- I know.

53:58.793 --> 54:01.979
I know. Well, I told you to put
shoes on, and you didn't believe me.

54:02.059 --> 54:03.026
Okay, give my your hands.

54:03.126 --> 54:04.718
- Okay.
- Right there.

54:07.126 --> 54:08.354
Ava, what is this?

54:09.560 --> 54:13.455
Just a little something
that says, "I love you."

54:16.460 --> 54:17.449
How...

54:19.993 --> 54:22.517
- How did you get this here?
- I have my ways.

54:22.627 --> 54:25.025
Ah, you...

54:25.126 --> 54:27.280
are the most amazing woman.

54:29.059 --> 54:30.280
I love it.

54:33.059 --> 54:34.313
Oh, okay, I have a question.

54:34.393 --> 54:36.946
When are you taking me sailing on your boat?

54:37.026 --> 54:38.516
- Our boat.
- Okay.

54:38.627 --> 54:40.480
- Our boat.
- I like it.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.812
Ah, thank you.

54:41.892 --> 54:44.189
You're welcome. Happy birthday, babe.

54:44.293 --> 54:45.692
All aboard. Let's go.

54:47.560 --> 54:48.549
Oh, no. Oh, look.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.887
We have some work to do.

54:49.993 --> 54:50.891
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

54:50.993 --> 54:53.613
Not in great shape,
but it's gonna be so worth it.

54:53.693 --> 54:55.812
Ah, I... I can't believe you did this.

54:55.892 --> 54:57.450
Ohh!

54:59.460 --> 55:02.946
I feel like an electric sander
would have been a worthwhile investment.

55:06.627 --> 55:08.218
I'm gonna go make us some lunch.

55:08.326 --> 55:10.520
- You want something?
- Oh, sounds perfect.

55:10.627 --> 55:11.719
Be right back.

56:00.859 --> 56:03.349
There is no easy way to say this.

56:03.460 --> 56:04.480
It's metastasized.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.647
It's very aggressive,

56:06.727 --> 56:09.193
spread much further than we thought.

56:09.293 --> 56:11.556
Uh, tests are showing that the lungs,

56:11.660 --> 56:14.058
the lymph nodes, and the liver
have all been affected.

56:14.159 --> 56:18.559
In cases like these,
treatment options are very limited.

56:18.660 --> 56:21.217
Depending upon the status
of the affected organs,

56:21.326 --> 56:24.647
some patients choose to forego treatment

56:24.727 --> 56:27.057
in favor of medication

56:27.159 --> 56:30.149
simply to keep them more comfortable.

56:31.326 --> 56:33.946
Yeah, but we beat this once before,

56:34.026 --> 56:35.946
so we'll... we'll beat it again.

56:36.026 --> 56:37.979
Ben, you have to try to understand.

56:38.059 --> 56:39.185
This is stage four.

56:39.293 --> 56:41.113
Okay. Stage four,

56:41.193 --> 56:46.217
so just tell us how we keep it
from going to stage five.

56:48.326 --> 56:50.054
There is no stage five.

56:56.993 --> 56:58.187
No.

56:58.293 --> 56:59.385
No.

57:06.660 --> 57:08.058
No.

57:08.159 --> 57:09.558
Excuse me.

57:15.993 --> 57:19.290
You and your husband have some
very difficult decisions to make.

57:22.393 --> 57:24.189
You can call me anytime,

57:24.293 --> 57:27.313
day or night, with any questions.

57:27.393 --> 57:28.553
Thank you.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.956
I'm sorry.

57:32.326 --> 57:33.349
We're gonna be okay.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.856
Ben!

57:44.493 --> 57:45.391
He's wrong.

57:45.493 --> 57:46.482
Okay? It's a lie.

57:47.560 --> 57:49.146
We'll get a second opinion.

57:49.226 --> 57:50.715
We'll order more tests.

57:50.826 --> 57:53.313
We beat this once. We can beat it again.

57:53.393 --> 57:55.480
I am not gonna stand here

57:55.560 --> 57:58.391
and let him tell me that there
is nothing we can do.

57:58.493 --> 58:00.050
Okay, I'm not gonna accept that!

58:00.159 --> 58:02.779
We are not gonna accept that!

58:02.859 --> 58:04.019
- Ben...
- No!

58:10.993 --> 58:12.216
No.

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:43.857
It's too soon.

01:01:51.293 --> 01:01:53.385
I could have a thousand years with you,

01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:55.357
and it would still be too soon.

01:02:02.726 --> 01:02:04.318
I don't want to leave you.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.318
But I'm not scared.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:15.384
I'm really not.

01:02:18.126 --> 01:02:19.387
I just...

01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:23.990
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:02:34.993 --> 01:02:36.983
I love our life together.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.291
No, it...

01:02:45.492 --> 01:02:47.686
it hasn't been long enough.

01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:54.721
But I have no regrets.

01:02:58.392 --> 01:03:00.359
And most important to me...

01:03:01.859 --> 01:03:04.292
at the end of all this...

01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:07.125
is that you don't either.

01:03:27.692 --> 01:03:30.659
One day, you're gonna sail
this boat for real...

01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:36.955
and when you do, I'll be with you.

01:03:52.692 --> 01:03:55.682
Get some rest. I love you, sweetheart.

01:03:55.792 --> 01:03:57.349
I love you.

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:02.020
Hey, little girl.

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:09.979
I love you.

01:04:10.059 --> 01:04:11.279
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:12.348
Okay.

01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:30.858
I want to... go home.

01:06:09.392 --> 01:06:13.382
"In his great mercy,
he has given us new birth

01:06:13.492 --> 01:06:15.186
"into a living hope

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:18.691
"through the resurrection
of Jesus Christ from the dead

01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:20.279
"and into an inheritance

01:06:20.359 --> 01:06:24.850
"that can never perish, spoil, or fade.

01:06:24.959 --> 01:06:27.516
"This inheritance is kept in Heaven for you,

01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:31.445
"who through faith
are shielded by God's power

01:06:31.525 --> 01:06:33.445
"until the coming of the salvation

01:06:33.525 --> 01:06:37.015
is ready to be revealed in the last time."

01:06:38.525 --> 01:06:42.686
<i>No matter how much you prepare yourself
for the loss of a loved one...</i>

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:47.555
<i>no matter how many weeks or months you had</i>

01:06:47.659 --> 01:06:52.285
<i>to settle it in your mind
and in your heart...</i>

01:06:55.726 --> 01:06:58.646
<i>there still comes that inevitable shock</i>

01:06:58.726 --> 01:07:01.215
<i>and that grim final blow when you realize</i>

01:07:01.325 --> 01:07:03.792
<i>that the one most precious is no longer here.</i>

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:10.979
<i>I find I say to myself</i>

01:07:11.059 --> 01:07:13.491
<i>over and over again under my breath...</i>

01:07:16.059 --> 01:07:17.548
<i>"She's gone."</i>

01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:22.348
<i>Gone with her are
a thousand other precious things</i>

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:24.323
<i>that made life so delightful.</i>

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.558
<i>Gone is the anticipation</i>

01:07:28.659 --> 01:07:31.216
<i>of returning home to her
at the end of the day.</i>

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:37.316
<i>Gone, the thrill of hearing her voice
at the other end of the phone.</i>

01:07:39.225 --> 01:07:43.283
<i>Gone, the feeling of her hand in mine.</i>

01:07:45.892 --> 01:07:48.518
<i>Gone is the sound of her laughter</i>

01:07:48.626 --> 01:07:50.217
<i>and the warmth of her smile.</i>

01:07:52.726 --> 01:07:57.284
<i>And this chilling, numbing awareness
that it will never be again.</i>

01:08:00.392 --> 01:08:01.859
<i>Ava is gone.</i>

01:09:42.325 --> 01:09:44.689
Go away!

01:10:03.392 --> 01:10:04.612
Can I help you?

01:10:04.692 --> 01:10:06.886
Yes, sir.

01:10:06.992 --> 01:10:08.779
I, uh, live next door.

01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:10.485
I thought you might need this.

01:10:11.826 --> 01:10:15.554
I thought, uh, better return it to you.

01:10:18.826 --> 01:10:20.349
Well, uh, hey, listen.

01:10:20.459 --> 01:10:23.016
Um, if you don't mind, I, uh...

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:27.684
I think I'm gonna rest just a bit
on your bench out here, all right?

01:11:18.158 --> 01:11:22.524
After I lost my wife,
I had all these photo albums.

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:24.058
I wouldn't look at 'em.

01:11:25.525 --> 01:11:27.889
All I could think about was, uh,

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:31.721
all the pictures that would never be made.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.482
Best years of our lives...

01:11:39.692 --> 01:11:41.659
were in those photo albums.

01:11:46.025 --> 01:11:49.890
Ah, you know, nobody can
tell you how to get over that.

01:11:49.992 --> 01:11:52.721
They will try, but nobody knows how you...

01:11:52.825 --> 01:11:55.349
how you feel better than you do.

01:11:58.726 --> 01:12:01.954
But one thing I... I will tell you
if you don't mind.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:10.114
There's still a lot of time
for a lot more pictures.

01:14:17.691 --> 01:14:18.885
- Mr. Charles...
- All right.

01:14:18.992 --> 01:14:21.459
...will you hand me that new one? Thanks.

01:14:44.492 --> 01:14:45.981
Hey.

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:49.122
Charlie. How are you?

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:57.692
I...I don't know baseball.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:59.849
You know, cricket, yes. Cricket, I love.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:01.112
That one, you like.

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:03.182
My ticket, yeah.

01:15:07.225 --> 01:15:09.445
Oh, you look good, buddy.

01:15:14.725 --> 01:15:17.145
It's, uh... Brought you take,
'cause I love you, bro.

01:15:17.225 --> 01:15:18.645
Who wants some snacks?

01:15:18.725 --> 01:15:20.192
- I am famished.
- I do.

01:15:20.292 --> 01:15:21.611
I'll get us some drinks.

01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:24.445
- Good, yeah?
- I have some chips in here.

01:15:24.525 --> 01:15:25.855
I got some crackers in here.

01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:28.187
Looks like those horrible
nacho-flavored things.

01:15:28.292 --> 01:15:30.778
Take your time, Ben.
Nobody's thirsty over here.

01:15:30.858 --> 01:15:31.950
Yeah, all right.

01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:47.445
Hello.

01:15:47.525 --> 01:15:51.352
<i>Uh, yes. May I speak with Ava Morton, please?</i>

01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:01.022
Um, this is her husband.

01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:02.456
Can I help you with something?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.650
<i>Are you Mr. Benjamin Morton?</i>

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:08.557
Yes.

01:16:08.658 --> 01:16:13.778
<i>Mr. Morton, I'm calling on behalf
of Social Services of Marseilles.</i>

01:16:13.858 --> 01:16:18.655
<i>Do you and your wife know
a Ms. Monique Marceau?</i>

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:22.216
Yes. She's, um...

01:16:22.325 --> 01:16:25.520
I mean, she was my wife's best friend.

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:29.112
<i>I'm sorry to have to give you
this news over the phone, sir,</i>

01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:31.778
<i>but Ms. Marceau unfortunately died</i>

01:16:31.858 --> 01:16:34.723
<i>in a car accident a couple weeks ago.</i>

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.112
<i>I know this must be very hard,</i>

01:16:38.192 --> 01:16:42.444
<i>but you and your wife are listed
in our records as the legal guardians</i>

01:16:42.524 --> 01:16:45.112
<i>in the case of Ms. Marceau's passing.</i>

01:16:45.192 --> 01:16:47.182
What... Is Noey okay?

01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:49.418
<i>She's currently in the care
of the Sisters of Saint-Bernard.</i>

01:16:50.992 --> 01:16:53.778
<i>I was calling to see when we might be able</i>

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:57.444
<i>to arrange for you and Mrs. Morton
to come to Marseilles.</i>

01:16:57.524 --> 01:17:00.855
<i>If you wish to take responsibility
for the child,</i>

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:04.478
<i>we will need you to fill out
the necessary paperwork,</i>

01:17:04.558 --> 01:17:07.112
<i>and there will be several court proceedings</i>

01:17:07.192 --> 01:17:09.279
<i>if you wish to return her...</i>

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:10.611
- Um...
- <i>...to the States.</i>

01:17:10.691 --> 01:17:12.022
Ma'am...

01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:17.556
my wife is no longer with us.

01:17:17.658 --> 01:17:20.489
Um, she passed away a few months ago.

01:17:23.192 --> 01:17:24.715
I'm so... I'm sorry.

01:17:24.825 --> 01:17:27.452
I...I just don't really know
what to do with all this.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:33.358
<i>Sir, first, I'm so sorry
to hear about your wife.</i>

01:17:33.459 --> 01:17:35.978
<i>Of course I understand how overwhelming</i>

01:17:36.058 --> 01:17:37.778
<i>this all must be for you.</i>

01:17:37.858 --> 01:17:40.018
<i>There are other options</i>

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:44.312
<i>if you feel you're unable at this time
to care for the child.</i>

01:17:44.392 --> 01:17:48.348
<i>Since there are no next of kin,</i>

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:51.857
<i>the next best option would be to relocate her</i>

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:55.112
<i>to a temporary foster situation.</i>

01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:59.852
<i>I assure you she'll be
very well taken care of there.</i>

01:17:59.958 --> 01:18:03.811
<i>If then you decide that, long term,</i>

01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:07.347
<i>you are unable to fulfill
the role of guardian,</i>

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:10.516
<i>adoption processes can also...</i>

01:18:12.158 --> 01:18:15.886
<i># 10 years down the road #</i>

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.645
<i># I'll be cleaning out my closet #</i>

01:18:20.725 --> 01:18:23.715
<i># Getting rid of old clothes #</i>

01:18:28.025 --> 01:18:31.151
<i># I reach behind my winter coat #</i>

01:18:33.225 --> 01:18:36.444
<i># And I stumble upon shoe boxes #</i>

01:18:36.524 --> 01:18:38.957
<i># Filled with old ghosts #</i>

01:18:41.292 --> 01:18:46.225
<i># Why do I hang on to your pictures? #</i>

01:18:46.325 --> 01:18:51.553
<i># Why do I hang on to your dress? #</i>

01:18:53.658 --> 01:18:57.523
<i># It kills me to see you #</i>

01:18:59.292 --> 01:19:03.383
<i># But it kills me not to #</i>

01:19:03.491 --> 01:19:05.611
<i># Kills me to remember #</i>

01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:09.818
<i># Oh, and it kills me to forget #</i>

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:27.279
<i># So I suppose you'll be
in every song I sing #</i>

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.052
This is a very nice doll.

01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:01.056
<i>Merci.</i>

01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:05.716
<i>Tante</i> Ava gave it to me when I was a baby.

01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.220
I know.

01:20:10.391 --> 01:20:12.881
She lives in Heaven with <i>Maman.</i>

01:20:12.992 --> 01:20:14.720
Yes, she does.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:18.016
I miss <i>Maman.</i>

01:20:23.858 --> 01:20:24.984
Me, too.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.051
Maybe we could miss them together.

01:20:34.858 --> 01:20:38.112
<i>Je suis Nouvelle Vie Marceau,</i>

01:20:38.192 --> 01:20:41.216
but people mostly just call me Noey.

01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:45.851
So you can call me that, too, if you want.

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.322
I'd like that.

01:20:50.891 --> 01:20:53.222
You could call me...

01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:56.453
Uncle Ben.

01:20:59.725 --> 01:21:04.556
I'm going to live with you, right, Uncle Ben?

01:21:04.658 --> 01:21:06.488
If that's okay.

01:21:08.658 --> 01:21:11.023
Do you like pancakes?

01:21:11.125 --> 01:21:12.386
Heh.

01:21:14.025 --> 01:21:15.787
I love pancakes.

01:21:17.358 --> 01:21:18.723
Then it's okay.

01:21:18.825 --> 01:21:20.849
Heh.

01:21:21.858 --> 01:21:22.778
Noey.

01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:24.950
Ah, Monsieur Morton.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.716
So glad you made it.

01:21:27.825 --> 01:21:29.778
How was your trip?

01:21:29.858 --> 01:21:31.347
Fine. Let me help you.

01:21:32.491 --> 01:21:34.390
Thank you.

01:21:34.491 --> 01:21:35.890
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.047
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:21:55.725 --> 01:22:00.280
<i>There are mountaintop experiences
in our journey through this world...</i>

01:22:02.158 --> 01:22:07.216
<i>those rare and lucid moments
when everything seems right...</i>

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:09.985
<i>and anything is possible.</i>

01:22:12.324 --> 01:22:14.189
<i>There are those ordinary days</i>

01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:17.986
<i>when we may not be thrillingly aware
of what lies in the future...</i>

01:22:19.191 --> 01:22:20.818
<i>but we know it's still out there.</i>

01:22:24.025 --> 01:22:25.945
<i>There are also those strange times</i>

01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:29.015
<i>when things do not add up or make sense...</i>

01:22:30.491 --> 01:22:32.287
<i>when we seem to be forgotten...</i>

01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:35.381
<i>when the heavens are brass.</i>

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:41.824
<i>But it's all the moments, good and bad...</i>

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.284
<i>that make up life.</i>

01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:50.818
<i>And the most important thing
to do with life...</i>

01:22:53.992 --> 01:22:55.611
<i>is to live it.</i>

01:22:56.305 --> 01:23:02.689
