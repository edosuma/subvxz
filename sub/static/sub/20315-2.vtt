Hold on. Alarm.

00:08.119 --> 00:12.120
There you go. It's midnight.
It's poppin' off.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.000
Right now is a lyrical tribute,
yeah, to my Angel.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.240
And it is because
she is turning...

00:20.280 --> 00:22.800
a whole year older.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.520

That was pure emotional inside.
We're all feeling it.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.680
Steves has even got
a tear in his eye.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.360
It might just be from the smoke.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.120
But, I... Yeah,
it was emotional though.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.920
[Beats] Still liked it.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.360
[Steves] Really enjoyed it.
[he snorts]

01:24.400 --> 01:27.560
Hold on.
[coughs]

01:27.600 --> 01:30.440
Evening, boys. All right?
Come through.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.640
The old birthday thing,
you know what I mean?
Bare early, like.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.680
Easy! Ah, look at that. Look
how she's holding the spoon.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.600
It's like a mic. Natural
instinct. Just like her daddy.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.080
-Doing the cards and that?
-Loads of cards, yeah.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.880
Crack one open,
see what it says.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.400
-"Happy birthday, Angel".
-That's a thoughtful message.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.200
Not even any money in it,
as well.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.200
It's pointless if they're
not gonna make an effort.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.360
Don't worry, Angel.
Nanna sent you some money.
Tell 'em how old you are today.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.160
-Five.
-Oh, the big five!

02:05.200 --> 02:07.320
My little Angel's getting old.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.759
I started getting crow's feet
and deep lines when I was
your age.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.960
So you're lucky Mummy knows how
to fight the signs of ageing.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.240
I've got a two for one
manicure and eyebrow treading

02:17.280 --> 02:22.080
at Brentford's Nails
down the high street, just
like a little birthday treat.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.880
I've got something as well.
I was gonna wait for him to get
down here before I told you.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.680
But Decoy is actually gonna be
your chauffy...the driver,
for the day.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.960
-Thanks.
-Cos you've gotta look good for
your little party, ain't ya?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.480
-Yes.
-Yeah? Ah!

02:39.520 --> 02:42.920
Party being actually
organised by yours truly. Ah!

02:42.960 --> 02:45.160
It's gonna be absolute
madness, innit?

02:45.200 --> 02:48.440
She's gonna be going mental,
this little one, innit?

02:48.480 --> 02:53.080
<i>The thing is with kids, yeah,
it's like quite hard to predict
their little life momencies.</i>

02:53.120 --> 02:56.600
That's why birthdays are good,
cos you always see 'em coming

02:56.640 --> 03:00.120
and, like, make sure you're
there for every one, like.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.320
Not the actual birth, actually.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.560
Cos the actual birth is
different. We had a whole
new aerial revamp.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.640
We had to do the station up
and that. It was bare madness.
Miche understood.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.960
Anyway, when she was on her way
to the hospital, she ended up
bumping into Decoy,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.840
so he took her, it was fine.
It all worked out in the end.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.320
Even took some photos.
I did make him delete
them, though, cos...

03:25.360 --> 03:30.400
he shouldn't really have been
down that end in the first
place, cos it's a bit...

03:30.440 --> 03:34.800
Make sure you have a good time.
When you get back, Daddy'll have
a party sorted for you, yeah?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.760
-Yeah.
-All right. Sweet!

03:36.800 --> 03:39.360
-Don't be running off with them.
-[Miche laughs nervously]

03:39.400 --> 03:42.520
-Course not, man. Do you want
me to get anything?
- Got it all sorted, mate.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.520
Chabuds is getting this banging
premium Polish vodka, like.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.880
Yeah, but what about, like,
balloons or a cake or something?

03:48.920 --> 03:52.840
Yeah... Yes, I've got it
all on here. I'm sorting it.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.360
Come on. Come on, guys. Get out!

03:55.400 --> 03:58.160
-Yeah? See you lot later.
-Sorry.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.880
Sorry.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.280
It's all worth it though, innit?
See the look on her face?

04:09.320 --> 04:13.800
Ah, she's so excited. To me,
it's about giving her a memory
she will never forget.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.720
Although she probably will
forget it, cos she's only five

04:17.760 --> 04:21.600
and, like, when she gets
into her drug-taking years,
she'll be wrecked then

04:21.640 --> 04:25.840
and her memory will get wiped,
so... Still good to make
an effort though.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.840
[Snoop Dogg
<i>Ain't No Fun</i> plays]

04:35.880 --> 04:40.080
-Sorry.
-Oh, no! I like that tune, yeah.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.880
-Yeah.
-Even with...?

04:42.920 --> 04:46.160
-You like this one,
don't you, Angel?
-Yeah.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.040
All right, it's 35 for
the smoke machine, yeah?

05:03.080 --> 05:05.880
Right, chuck in a couple
of the strobes

05:05.920 --> 05:10.440
and I'll bump it up to 40
and we'll call it quits, get
a little drink for yourself.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.840
Boss, I got them vodkas
in for tonight, mate.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.120
-Straight from Poland, yeah?
Fresh off the boat.
-Shh!

05:17.160 --> 05:19.720
Why didn't you just
come a bit later?

05:19.760 --> 05:22.080
Cos I knew that you
were busy and that.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.640
One second, mate.
Just...whatever, just...

05:27.320 --> 05:30.640
People actually read it
as "polish".

05:30.680 --> 05:34.120
So it's a good legal loophole
that we've got going on.

05:34.160 --> 05:39.840
The first few batches we had
a few teething problems. People
losing their teeth and that.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.600
But what we've tried to do is
make it as strong as possible,

05:43.640 --> 05:49.120
without any serious side effects
or notes for disabilities.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.320
People in Southall are
already going crazy for it.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.840
Don't care!
Don't do birthday cakes.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.800
Get the geezer that comes
in the van to pick one up
on the way here.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.240
Can I speak to
someone that's...?

06:01.280 --> 06:04.200
Give me someone that's above
you, yeah? Don't touch that!

06:04.240 --> 06:06.720
-Steves! Come on, mate.
-Eh?

06:06.760 --> 06:11.280
Wake up. You've got your set
in a minute, you mug. Hello?

06:11.320 --> 06:15.400
Right, basically, if
I'm forking out all this
for the smoke machine, yeah,

06:15.440 --> 06:18.120
I'm definitely gonna need
a birthday cake chucked in.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.800
Well, I don't care if it's
not Argos policy, yeah?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.960
Change it! That's my policy.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.640
There, that's the only one
I could find.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.040
Ah, thank you. Cheers.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.120
-Put that on.
-Shall I tuck it in?

06:41.160 --> 06:44.680
Yeah, tuck it in.
All the way round.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.320
There. See? [laughs]

06:47.360 --> 06:51.400
-There you go.
-No, you're... Come here.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.400
Cos we only really did
the short ties in school.

06:54.440 --> 06:58.240
-Shirt really smells.
-Don't worry about
how you smell.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.160
Just worry about looking smart,
that's the most important thing.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.680
Cos I've got a job interview
today at Tie One.

07:05.720 --> 07:10.600
Not the country, the suit shop,
the one next to Greggs
in West Ealing.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.040
So Roche knows
the manager there, so...

07:13.080 --> 07:16.000
-Got an interview today.
- So you've got a good chance.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.120
So, yeah, I'm really looking
forward to it, actually.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.600
Yeah. Be nice, won't it,
to have a job?

07:21.640 --> 07:25.080
Then you could start
paying some bills,

07:25.120 --> 07:27.960
spending some more time
with me and Craig.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.360
Yeah, cos then...
Yeah, then I can spend...

07:31.400 --> 07:33.800
more time with you lot
and that.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.360
-That's better.
-Yeah?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.040
James Bond sort of shit.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.000
<i>Well, I hope he gets it. It'd
nice to have a bit of money.</i>

07:43.040 --> 07:46.720
Cos it was all just me
making all the money.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.200
<i>That'd be good.</i>

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
Easy, boys.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.040
<i>[Roche] I think it'd
be good for him.</i>

07:52.080 --> 07:54.400
<i>I think he'd feel better. He'd
feel a sense of achievement...</i>

07:54.440 --> 07:56.720
if he came home with some money.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.960
You've got that job
interview today, yeah?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.880
Yeah, it's an absolute
nightmare, mate.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.680
-Do you want to do a bit
of role play for the interview?
-Yeah.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.600
Okay, pull up a chair, mate.
Pull up a chair.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.080
Listen, mate, you need
to be sure of yourself, yeah?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.960
You need to be
completely confident.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.560
From the minute
you walk in the door,

08:13.600 --> 08:17.720
you grab the goat by the horns.
Don't be afraid of the goat.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.520
-That's your goat, okay?
-Yeah.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.960
You are going to penetrate
that goat, okay?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.080
This is, uh,
this is where I work.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.080
This is Quality Foods,
quality and quantity.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.600
I haven't always worked here,
but, uh, you know,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.799
I'm not going to pretend
this was my dream,

08:35.840 --> 08:41.400
sitting in a Portacabin,
making sure that the Quality
Foods, uh, are paid for.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.000
So you need to know
everything about ties.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.520
You need to know what tie
goes with what shirt.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.280
What's the battery life
like on my musical tie?

08:50.320 --> 08:54.480
-How do I get these masala
stains out of the tie?
-What if you don't though?

08:54.520 --> 08:58.600
I dunno if you can see,
but that screen is just
that view out of that window.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.880
I have spoken to them
about it and said, "That's
what I'm actually looking at.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.240
I don't need to look at it
on the screen," but...

09:06.280 --> 09:11.000
they said that's the most
important bit of the car park.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.400
So if it's a woman,
you use your charm.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.480
You'll be like, "All right,
sex. I love what's
on your face."

09:16.520 --> 09:18.760
-Something about their face.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:18.800 --> 09:23.400
If it's a fella, if it's
a geezer, you have a
bit of banter with him.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.440
"All right, dude, what you
up to tonight? You going down
the chippy for a pint, mate?

09:27.480 --> 09:32.760
Smash some brasses tonight?
Did you see the fight on
<i>Match Of The Day</i> last night?"

09:32.800 --> 09:35.440
-What fight?
-No, okay, I tell you what...

09:35.480 --> 09:38.720
Maybe for you it's best
not to say too much, okay?

09:38.760 --> 09:41.360
Keep it short, keep it sweet.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.480
-Always leave them wanting more.
-Always leave them wanting more.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.000
-Exactly. Say it again.
-Always leave them wanting more.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.800
-Leave them or lead them?
-Leave...leave, leave them.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.080
-You've confused me now.
-Okay.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.760
[both] Always leave them
wanting more.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.040
-Exactly.
-Sick.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.080
So this is actually, like,
a fish pedicure.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.760
It's really good if you
have dry skin or arthritis.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.760
How you getting on?
Does it tickle, does it? Yeah.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.840
No, it probably won't, because
I'm actually a qualified
freelance nail technician,

10:18.880 --> 10:23.640
so I do a lot of these therapies
on Angel already so she's very
used to this kind of thing.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.400
-Oh, nice.
-I was going to get some of
these fish for my home salon,

10:27.440 --> 10:30.920
but the man in the pet shop
wasn't sure what I meant.

10:30.960 --> 10:35.640
<i>Being a mum is the hardest job
in the world and the most
important job in the world.</i>

10:35.680 --> 10:38.000
As soon as you give birth,
that's like you've got the job

10:38.040 --> 10:41.000
and you need to work hard
and make sure you keep the job.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.440
Daddy seems to like
the fish, don't he?

10:46.480 --> 10:49.400
Shall we see if Daddy would
like to get his feet done, too?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.920
-Um, nah...
-He's not her daddy, no.
Like, he's our driver.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.600
-I'll just go to the car.
-Yeah, see you in a bit.

10:56.640 --> 11:01.880
Do you know what, yeah?
You can shove your
mini-Kias up your arse, mate!

11:01.920 --> 11:04.760
Absolute mug!

11:04.800 --> 11:07.200
Boss, let me know if
you need any help, yeah?

11:07.240 --> 11:11.360
I mean, anything you get
from Argos, Chabuddy G
can get you as well.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.600
Tell you what, Chabuds mate,
have you got a smoke machine?

11:14.640 --> 11:17.840
Cos I've still got so much more
on this list I still ain't got.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.920
I ain't got...a cake, balloons,
party food, strobe light,

11:22.960 --> 11:25.880
banners, clown.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.120
Oh, fuck! And also I ain't got
Angel's birthday present.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.640
Listen, mate, don't worry, okay?
How much money you got?

11:35.040 --> 11:37.960
-About 70's I reckon.
-£70, yeah?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.360
-At present, yeah.
-Bit of a coincidence, actually,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.720
cos you know I organise
parties all the time.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.160
I can give you the full party
package... Let me just check.

11:46.200 --> 11:51.400
It will include cake,
balloons, clown...

11:51.440 --> 11:54.120
Yeah, pretty much everything
on there I can do for you.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.840
-All that, what, for 70?
-All for 70, mate, okay?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.640
Party is practically
my middle name, yeah?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.640
Cha-Party G!

12:04.440 --> 12:07.120
Do you usually do it
from the top then?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.320
That's how I was trained
to do it, yeah.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.400
Interesting. Yeah, it's like
a foreign technique.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.040
So maybe if we get a bit
more, like, from below.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.960
And take a deep breath.
[she exhales]

12:19.000 --> 12:21.520
Are you ready?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.920
-Good girl.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.800
-Hi, babe. Yeah, right now?
<i>-I'm finding Angel's</i>
<i>present now, actually.</i>

12:30.840 --> 12:33.480
-Oh, okay.
<i>-There's so much, man.</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:37.480
Yeah, maybe, like, get her
something different. She's got
loads of guns now.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.400
No, I'm not getting her guns.
I'm by all the girlie stuff.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.800
-I was just ringing to check.
I'll speak to you in a bit.
-Bye, babe.

12:45.840 --> 12:51.440
It's mad, actually. Presents
are a proper big deal to kids,
like, these days.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.280
Ah, these are all right, innit?

12:54.320 --> 12:58.120
See that? That's sick.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.240
Ah! She'll love this, yeah.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.920
That's a good piece, that is.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.920
I shouldn't have give Chadbuds
all that money, actually.

13:12.960 --> 13:17.200
Here's one though. Little trick
of the trade if you want
a discount.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.400
All you've got to do is
give it a little...

13:32.920 --> 13:35.760
No. Good...good quality
that is, actually.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.080
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.720
Oh! Probably
the best place, cos...

13:42.760 --> 13:46.680
Read that. Music. That's her
main passion, anyway, so...

13:48.120 --> 13:51.080
What? Ah! No wires as well.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.760
That is... That's sick!
She'll love this, like.

Right. Cheers, fella.
Thank you.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.560
[whispers] Fuck!
I think that was a girl.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.800
Oh! Fuck, it's all fluffy.
Look at that.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.440
I love these. Water coolers.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.040
So I'll just...

14:53.680 --> 14:57.960
Oh, perfect. Yeah, that's
looking smooth right now.

They know what they're doing.

Oh, God!

15:28.680 --> 15:32.760
Oh, God, I had to use the bloody
stairs cos the lift is jammed.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.120
I tell you what, I haven't
sweated this much since my last
Russian passport control.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.880
-Grindah!
-Hello, mate.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.760
-Here you are, Boss.
-Just wrapping up the presents.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.880
Ah! Smashed it.
Came through, yeah?

15:45.920 --> 15:48.520
-All good?
-Yeah, brilliant, man.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.000
Let's see what we've got.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.640
Chocolate willies?
Everything's cock related.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.520
It's my little girl's birthday
party and there's cocks
everywhere!

16:07.560 --> 16:10.160
Listen, mate, it's still
all classic party stuff, yeah?

16:10.200 --> 16:13.640
All we've got to do is
disguise it a little bit, okay?

16:13.680 --> 16:18.160
If it doesn't look like a willy,
you won't think twice before
putting it in your mouth.

16:18.200 --> 16:22.160
I'm not putting it in my mouth!
I'm not putting anything like
that anywhere near my mouth!

16:22.200 --> 16:25.280
The company is called
Chabuddy's Party Package,

16:25.320 --> 16:28.400
which is a bit of play on words,
if you know what I mean?

16:28.440 --> 16:32.120
It's mostly aimed at hen
parties. I've never really
done a children's party before.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.000
It's the same thing,
really, isn't it?

16:34.040 --> 16:37.040
-Where's the smoke machine?
-I've got incense, mate.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.360
-What's incense?
-It's like smoke machines.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.120
But it has a lovely aroma
attached to it, free of charge!

16:43.160 --> 16:48.040
-Not a smoke machine?
-Not exactly, but I've got a
choice of cherry or sandalwood.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.680
Oh, for f...
Definitely cherry!

16:50.720 --> 16:54.440
-Good choice.
-Why the fuck do I want
to smell sandals?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.320
-What's that then?
-That's one of my favourites.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.280
-Oh, willies! For f...
-After dinner willies.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.599
-Stop touching 'em!
-Mint, minty.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.839
Feeling quite confident,
actually. Yeah.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.920
Oh! Vibrating.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.680
Oh, Roche.

17:16.720 --> 17:20.000
"Don't fuck this up..."

17:20.040 --> 17:23.480
-Words of encouragement.
-[door opens]

17:23.520 --> 17:25.960
Kevin Bates?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.760
-Hello, Boss.
-Hi, Kevin. I'm Chris. Friend
of Roche's. How you doing?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
-Yeah, good, man. You?
-Good. Very good, thank you.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.760
Lovely. I've got these boys
with me. Hope that's all right?

17:33.800 --> 17:36.360
-Roche warned me about them.
-Oh, right.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.920
Not <i> Watchdog,</i> are you?

17:38.960 --> 17:41.480
No, cos we're completely
above board here.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.080
Yeah, lovely.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.000
This is really just a formality.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.960
Nothing for you to worry about.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.920
Regional manager's sitting in.
Going ask a few questions.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.080
-No tests or anything.
-Yeah, fuck doing tests, mate.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.800
I've never done tests
in my life, so...

17:55.840 --> 17:58.480
-Um, anyway, do you want...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.400
-Have a seat.
-Cheers, thank you.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.440
Hello. I'm Kevin.
Nice to meet you.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.760
Just take this off. Phoar!
Jesus, that's pungent.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.400
So it's all about just making
use of what you've got.
Using your imagination and that.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.520
So the chocolate penis cake
is now a caterpillar cake, yeah?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.120
Chocolate willies,
now bunny rabbits, yeah?

18:25.160 --> 18:28.000
-Novelty condoms, balloons.
-Disgusting!

18:28.040 --> 18:31.360
Business is all about adapting,
rolling with the punches.

18:31.400 --> 18:35.280
For example, I used to have
this Indian restaurant when
I first started out.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.720
But I changed it
to an Italian one.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.720
There was just too
many Indian restaurants
in the Curry Mile, I adapted.

18:41.760 --> 18:46.040
So in the menu, we changed
a few things. We had
the samosa calzone.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.840
We had the spaghetti
tikka masala.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.080
We even renamed the chef,
so Guda became Gino.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.640
And Mandip became Mario.

18:54.680 --> 18:59.080
Which was quite funny, actually,
cos he was a part-time
plumber as well.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.680
Right, well, thank you for
coming in to see us
today, Kevin.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.680
And thank you for having me
in your wonderful establishment.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.080
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

19:10.120 --> 19:13.240
Well, my name's Kevin Bates,
aka Beats.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.640
I co-run a pirate radio station
called Kurupt FM.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.840
108.9 on the dial. Best believe.

19:20.880 --> 19:26.480
Um, we play mainly garage music
and drum and bass quite
late in the evening.

19:26.520 --> 19:31.680
But not the new stuff, more old
school Jungle sort of stuff.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.560
So, uh, yeah, I'm a DJ,
but I also ad lib a bit as well.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.840
I run it with my partner
in crime, MC Grindah.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.440
[Miche] We're keeping, like,
numbers down this year,

19:47.480 --> 19:50.880
so we've just invited Angel's
main friends. So, like,
Beats, Steves,

19:50.920 --> 19:53.680
Weapon X, all that lot and,
like, her Nan's coming as well.

19:53.720 --> 19:58.320
A lot of her school mates
are quite immature and a few of
them Grindah didn't get on with.

19:58.360 --> 20:02.960
So...just better to keep
them away so we don't have
any trouble this year.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
[drum and bass plays]

20:08.560 --> 20:10.840
Love this tune.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.200
Happy birthday!

20:18.240 --> 20:21.120
Come here! Surprise!

20:21.160 --> 20:24.360
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, it smells really nice.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.440
It's incense. It's a new thing.
It's like smoke machines
but better and more fragrant.

20:29.480 --> 20:33.000
-I love the balloons.
-Don't touch them.
They're a bit greasy.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.720
Don't touch them either
and don't let her touch
the chocolate bunnies.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.480
I've been surrounded by ties
my whole life.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.240
At the age of 13,
when I started at school,

20:45.280 --> 20:49.080
I really got into 'em.
Just looking at the way
people do them up.

20:49.120 --> 20:55.360
Just wear them and, like...
Yeah, so man does have
a huge passion in ties.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.600
Right, great. Moving on.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.920
What sort of skill sets
do you have

21:00.960 --> 21:03.800
that would enable you to
perform this role effectively?

21:03.840 --> 21:06.360
Uh, skill sets?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.320
DJ set eight till ten, so...

21:10.520 --> 21:13.200
Do you want me to
repeat the question?

21:13.240 --> 21:17.240
I was going to stop you there,
actually, Christopher, cos I
need to head to the toilet.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.400
-Okay, well, actually...
-Don't worry.
I know where it is.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.360
Always leave 'em wanting more.
Standard!

21:30.400 --> 21:32.600
Job done.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.000

21:39.960 --> 21:41.440
Sweet!

21:47.880 --> 21:50.680
[dance music plays]

21:56.560 --> 21:57.840
Stop!

21:57.880 --> 22:00.120
Turn for Angel, yeah?

22:00.160 --> 22:03.120
-What is it?
-Lucky girl!

22:07.320 --> 22:09.240
No, Steves!

22:09.280 --> 22:12.360
No, move it on, mate. It's
not your game, it's for Angel.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.600
Oi, Hitler!
Let him have one layer!

22:14.640 --> 22:17.120
Mum, be nice.
This is my mum, Carol.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.640
Don't tell 'em that.
People think we're sisters.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.920
You heard that once.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.440
Keep it moving.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.560
Keep it moving, Steves!

22:31.640 --> 22:35.240
Yeah, there's, like,
good news and bad news.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.840
I already know the bad news,
cos I spoke to Chris earlier.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.760
-I didn't really get that one.
-Course you didn't get it!

22:42.800 --> 22:46.760
-Cos you fucking walked out
halfway through.
-Sorry.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.920
I absolutely smashed it
with this one.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.960
Who's is that one?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.040
Decoy's. Which one's yours?

23:05.080 --> 23:07.800
It's pointless now.
His present's massive.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.080
-Mine's tiny compared to it.
-All right, guys, listen.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.280
Special appearance coming very
soon. Get your party hats on,

23:14.320 --> 23:19.040
cos we're gonna have a good
time, all right? Special
performance coming quite soon!

23:19.080 --> 23:22.120
-Decoy!
-I'm telling Decoy
about my modelling days.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.880
-Decoy doesn't give a shit
about your modelling days.
- Oh, shut up, lemon!

23:24.920 --> 23:27.560
I don't know why you knock
around with him, I swear to God.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.720
You weren't exactly a model,
you were an extra in
a DFS advert.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.360
Why have you got
a massive present?

23:32.400 --> 23:36.960
-It ain't nothing big, man.
-Of course it is. Kids love
massive presents.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.320
Mine's tiny compared to yours.
No, we've got to swap.

23:40.360 --> 23:44.200
Bruv, no. It's cool, man.
It ain't about size, is it?

23:44.240 --> 23:47.240
It's easy for you to say,
you're Jamaican.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.640
No, don't touch the balloon!

23:49.680 --> 23:52.360
Look, you have got to grow up.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.880
I'm already struggling
supporting Craig and
fucking Debo.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.520
-Who's Debo?
-He's that fucking African kid
me and Craig sponsor.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.120
Oh, yeah, he loves
him to bits though.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.440
To be fair, you can't put
a price on them things.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.160
Hello! Am I getting
through to you at all?

24:09.200 --> 24:13.880
Yeah, sorry. It's that clown
looks proper weird, like.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.320
Where's his shirt?

24:16.360 --> 24:19.760
Maybe it's just a modern
clown sort of thing.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.560
Ladies and gentlemen!

24:24.600 --> 24:27.960
Now the special entertainer
for tonight.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.840
The clown.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.800
[Miche] Oh? Yay, a clown!

24:36.840 --> 24:39.640
You've never had a clown
before, have you, Ange?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.160
Come on then, mate,
get to it.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.880
What do you want me to do?

24:51.920 --> 24:55.280
[music plays]

25:14.360 --> 25:18.160
[Miche] <i> I think part of being</i>
<i>a mum is being able to handle</i>
<i>whatever gets thrown at you.</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:20.720
Like, I've got this mug.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.800
It says on it
"Keep Calm, be a mum".

25:23.840 --> 25:26.160
That's like a slogan
I just live by now.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.600
Okay, make an animal out
of this or something, mate.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.280
<i>Whatever happens, I always
have to look after Angel.</i>

25:32.320 --> 25:35.640
<i>Make sure she's going to school
and not getting fat
or anything.</i>

25:35.680 --> 25:40.200
And if, like, one day,
I do look down on her and she's
getting chunky or whatever,

25:40.240 --> 25:43.120
then I'll just know what to do.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.240
Oh, my God! You could
crack walnuts with those!

25:49.280 --> 25:53.680
Right, that's it! You're done,
mate. Get out! Get out!

25:53.720 --> 25:57.640
Sick! Get out!
You're finished.

25:57.680 --> 26:02.640
It's was good, wasn't it,
like? He was actually, like,
a technically talented dancer.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.200
I'd like him for
my birthday, Miche.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.640
-I haven't been paid yet.
-I don't give a fuck, mate.
Sort it with Chabuds later.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.160
It's a five-year-old's
birthday party. She'll be
scarred for life now.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.720
It's all right.
He'll come back.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.480
You want to open some presents?
That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

26:19.520 --> 26:22.200
-Which one do you want first?
-That one?

26:22.240 --> 26:25.720
I think that's from Daddy.
Maybe he should be here
when you open it.

26:25.760 --> 26:29.440
Why is it...? Is it closed.
Oh, come on!

26:33.880 --> 26:37.560
What's...? It's not moving.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.600
-Oh!
-Some baby shampoo.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.880
Baby shampoo from Steves.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.360
Couldn't think what else
they really use, so...

26:47.400 --> 26:49.200
Hello?

26:51.280 --> 26:53.240
You're fucking joking me!

26:57.880 --> 27:00.240
Oh, a doll's house!

27:00.280 --> 27:02.560
Look at that! Ah!

27:02.600 --> 27:05.280
I love it!
I mean, Angel loves it.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.120
Thanks, Uncle Decoy.
What do you say?

27:08.160 --> 27:11.400
-You don't like it?
-No, I don't like doll's houses.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.640
Are you opening Daddy's one?

27:14.680 --> 27:16.800
All right, I gotta call.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.040
No fucking signal.
You got a phone on ya?

27:22.080 --> 27:25.160
-You'd see it if I had it, mate.
-What about you lot?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.920
I gotta tell them
to stop the party.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.320
You've got a microphone
from Daddy!

27:33.360 --> 27:35.800

-[applause]

28:06.840 --> 28:11.000
Angel is a bit of a tomboy,
like, but she's also
got her girlie side.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.920
Like, half of her is me,
like, girlie, nails, shopping.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.480
And the other half of her
is a bit more, like, violent,

28:17.520 --> 28:21.080
like stabbing stuff and,
like, breaking all her toys,

28:21.120 --> 28:24.320
and, like, shouting at me
and that's more like
her Grindah side.

28:24.360 --> 28:29.840
You got a screwdriver
or something? Completely
pointless, this whole thing.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.440
Did you just fart?
