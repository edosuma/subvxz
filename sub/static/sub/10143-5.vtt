00:25.388 --> 00:26.821
I know, I'm coming.

00:29.525 --> 00:33.494
If you want me to drag you out
over my shoulder, just say so.

00:33.528 --> 00:36.330
You can't treat me
like that until we're married.

00:41.436 --> 00:43.404
Five minutes,
I promise.

00:43.438 --> 00:46.407
No, now. You know it's not safe to stay.
The convoy is leaving.

00:46.441 --> 00:48.442
Okay.
Okay, I'm coming.

00:49.711 --> 00:50.979
Okay.

00:51.013 --> 00:52.447
What's wrong?

00:52.481 --> 00:54.582
It's his mother. They
were collecting firewood.

00:54.616 --> 00:55.583
The Janjaweed came.

00:55.617 --> 00:56.718
Janjaweed? Where?

00:57.353 --> 00:58.787
Oh! Okay.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.089
Subin, can you take him? Yes.

01:02.926 --> 01:04.226
Easy. Just gently.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.954
Can you hear me?

01:05.955 --> 01:08.643
Okay, she's been stabbed.
And raped too, by the looks of it.

01:08.668 --> 01:09.918
She's hemorrhaging completely.

01:09.934 --> 01:12.068
We'll need to operate.

01:12.103 --> 01:14.871
But Clare, we have no time. We have to get
back to the security compound before dark.

01:14.905 --> 01:16.806
If we leave now,
she'll die.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.507
Clare, we have had this discussion.
We cannot save everyone.

01:18.542 --> 01:22.378
Fine. Well,
you tell him.

01:22.413 --> 01:23.246
Go on, tell him,
because I can't.

01:25.382 --> 01:28.017
Tell him that we're gonna let his mother
die because our ride home is waiting.

01:28.051 --> 01:29.518
And then drag me out of
here like you promised,

01:29.553 --> 01:31.553
because that is the only way
that I'm leaving her now.

01:33.123 --> 01:34.523
Hi. Hi, can you hear me?

01:34.557 --> 01:36.258
I'm Doctor Clare Somersby,
I'm here to help you.

01:46.303 --> 01:48.337
So, how is she doing?

01:48.372 --> 01:49.906
Good.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.307
She's stable.

01:52.276 --> 01:53.577
Thank you for staying.

02:01.385 --> 02:02.913
He says you saved
his mother's life,

02:02.938 --> 02:06.122
and with these, he will save
yours. They're gris-gris.

02:06.123 --> 02:08.223
No, I couldn't.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.458
You're going to have to take them.
They are talismans. Very powerful.

02:10.994 --> 02:13.195
Thank you.

02:13.229 --> 02:15.766
He says his mother gave
them to him for his protection

02:15.791 --> 02:17.532
and now he gives them to you.

02:23.139 --> 02:24.440
They are coming.

02:37.622 --> 02:41.491
Get up, get up, get up.
Go, go, go, go! Get up, get up!

02:41.525 --> 02:44.361
Najim, sweetheart, she's still
sedated, she can't be moved.

02:46.197 --> 02:47.397
Come on, we have to go!
Clare, quick!

02:47.431 --> 02:48.965
Bakri, we can't
just leave him!

02:48.999 --> 02:50.900
Enough talk of martyrdom.

02:50.934 --> 02:52.334
We have to survive, or else our
purpose here will become meaningless.

02:53.536 --> 02:54.502
Go! Okay.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.171
Okay.

02:58.306 --> 02:59.373
Go, go, go!

03:23.131 --> 03:24.532
Back, back, back, back!

03:29.672 --> 03:31.474
Okay.

03:31.508 --> 03:32.575
I think we
should split up.

03:32.609 --> 03:34.210
No!

03:34.244 --> 03:36.312
Maybe there's a way I can draw
them, create a diversion.

03:36.347 --> 03:38.715
We stick together. Always.

03:49.158 --> 03:51.126
Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:14.550 --> 04:15.750
Bakri!

04:18.320 --> 04:19.519
- Run.
- Are you okay?

04:19.553 --> 04:20.588
Just go!

04:21.589 --> 04:23.123
Run!

04:23.158 --> 04:24.191
Run!

Michael.

06:18.513 --> 06:19.713
Michael.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.816
Michael!

06:29.857 --> 06:31.858
That blonde hottie
on the plane?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.393
Got her number.
Yeah?

06:36.898 --> 06:38.235
Right. New target.

06:38.260 --> 06:42.139
Ex-Royal Marine, turned
global arms dealer. Gerald Crawford.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.405
We have growing evidence that
Crawford supplied the weapons

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
used at the hotel siege
in New Delhi,

06:47.308 --> 06:49.109
as well as those used by
Connolly in the Cape Town heist.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.613
So the explosives that killed
Kate, they're from him.

06:52.648 --> 06:54.181
He's Latif's
chief armory.

06:54.216 --> 06:56.851
And normally ultra
security-conscious,

06:56.885 --> 06:59.854
never directly connected to
the weapons he supplies,

06:59.888 --> 07:01.822
until now.

07:01.857 --> 07:05.492
Two days ago Mombasa police broke a
shipyard smuggling ring led by this man,

07:05.526 --> 07:08.828
Central Yard controller
Ken Masoto.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.497
<i>Now, Masoto confessed</i>
<i>that Crawford bribed him</i>

07:11.531 --> 07:13.933
to let through an illegal arms
shipment destined for Sudan.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.501
What's more,

07:15.535 --> 07:19.172
<i>Crawford will personally supervise</i>
<i>the transfer onto trucks</i>

07:19.206 --> 07:21.641
<i>for overland transportation</i>
<i>to Darfur.</i>

07:21.675 --> 07:23.910
<i>He'll be traveling with his head</i>
<i>of security, Dieter Hendricks,</i>

07:23.944 --> 07:26.713
<i>former South African</i>
<i>Special Forces.</i>

07:26.747 --> 07:28.882
<i>They're meeting at the</i>
<i>docks tonight.</i>

07:28.916 --> 07:32.185
This is our chance to get to
Latif. I want Crawford alive.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.057
All right. Fox is
in the coop.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.169
<i>You can shoot his</i>
<i>bodyguard if that's any consolation.</i>

07:52.442 --> 07:56.578
The customs papers have been processed
as promised. It is all in order.

08:00.283 --> 08:03.518
As soon as Crawford confirms the
shipment and signs the ledger, move in.

08:07.656 --> 08:09.057
Number TN-3 form,

08:11.494 --> 08:13.934
to authorize transport
of chemical fertilizer.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.666
I have to sign for it, right?

08:18.201 --> 08:21.104
Don't worry, I've got
a spare one in the car.

08:23.474 --> 08:25.007
What's a TN-3 form?

08:26.310 --> 08:27.376
There isn't one.

08:27.411 --> 08:29.278
Shit. They made us, Scott!

08:32.482 --> 08:35.083
Track the feed. I
want eyes on, now.

08:43.561 --> 08:44.894
Just give me a bead.

08:44.929 --> 08:45.929
<i>Tell me where he's at.</i>

08:45.963 --> 08:47.664
Looking.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.065
Look for Hendricks, too.

08:51.969 --> 08:53.136
Copy that.

09:05.483 --> 09:06.783
<i>Where the fuck is he?</i>

09:08.252 --> 09:09.920
Got him, Sector 2,
primary target

09:09.954 --> 09:11.355
<i>heading towards the</i>
<i>storage facilities.</i>

09:11.389 --> 09:13.390
Sector 2? I'm in Sector 2.

09:14.492 --> 09:15.659
Fuck.

09:16.561 --> 09:17.828
Who are you?

09:17.862 --> 09:19.196
British Military
Intelligence.

09:21.099 --> 09:23.968
It's over, Crawford.

09:24.002 --> 09:27.271
Be smart. You've lost the shipment,
but we can still cut a deal.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.673
Don't tell me
what I've lost.

09:33.111 --> 09:34.144
Heading to Sector 2.

09:36.481 --> 09:37.548
You all right?

09:37.582 --> 09:39.016
Yeah.

09:41.386 --> 09:43.054
See what happens when
you go off without me?

09:43.088 --> 09:44.455
Then fucking keep up.

09:44.490 --> 09:46.424
Still no visual.

10:12.451 --> 10:14.953
Fucking...

10:14.987 --> 10:17.088
<i>Scott, what's your position?</i>

10:17.122 --> 10:18.648
Sounds like
Hendricks found him first.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.713
Scott?
Find me Crawford.

10:21.427 --> 10:22.627
The car's
on the move.

10:24.363 --> 10:25.396
Shit.

10:30.468 --> 10:31.635
Hey!

10:31.669 --> 10:32.836
Come on.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.707
Fuck.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.880
Go! You
know what to do!

10:52.624 --> 10:55.426
I believe you have a deal
you want to offer me.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.194
You sick fuck.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.401
Mike, Mike!
Easy, tiger!

11:03.435 --> 11:05.670
Hey, Grant said alive.

11:06.672 --> 11:07.839
Come here.

11:10.277 --> 11:11.277
Hands on your head.

11:12.379 --> 11:13.880
Keep 'em there.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.115
Fuck.

11:19.119 --> 11:20.753
And my reward for
this betrayal?

11:23.957 --> 11:27.193
If the information you provide
leads to Latif's arrest,

11:27.228 --> 11:30.363
you get a reduced sentence
in a British jail.

11:30.397 --> 11:34.100
Or you can rot in some African
hellhole for the rest of your life.

11:34.135 --> 11:36.736
Well, information such as
his point man in Europe?

11:39.906 --> 11:42.241
Very well. I've heard your
terms, now you listen to mine.

11:44.978 --> 11:47.880
That arms deal was a
humanitarian ransom payment,

11:47.914 --> 11:51.949
being made in exchange for a British aid
worker, a doctor, held hostage in Darfur.

11:51.984 --> 11:54.452
Yeah, yeah, of
course it was.

11:54.486 --> 11:56.520
Once the weapons arrived in
Khartoum, she was to be released.

11:56.555 --> 11:59.123
When did you get into the
humanitarian ransom business?

12:00.292 --> 12:02.093
She's my daughter.

12:05.531 --> 12:10.068
Get me my daughter back,
and I'll give you Latif.

12:12.037 --> 12:15.339
<i>My name is Clare Somersby,</i>
<i>and I am an aid worker.</i>

12:15.373 --> 12:17.008
<i>And I am here to</i>
<i>heal people...</i>

12:23.616 --> 12:26.151
How the fuck did
we miss this?

12:26.185 --> 12:28.186
The Embassy in Khartoum is
aware of Clare's abduction,

12:28.220 --> 12:30.322
but no link was
flagged to Crawford.

12:30.356 --> 12:33.091
She uses her
mother's maiden name,

12:33.125 --> 12:34.809
Clare's parents separated
when she was 12,

12:34.834 --> 12:36.652
and she's had no contact
with Crawford since.

12:36.862 --> 12:41.099
Someone knew. The
tape was sent to him direct.

12:41.133 --> 12:44.936
She was deliberately targeted
to ensure he got the weapons.

12:44.970 --> 12:47.972
Fucked him and ourselves
then, haven't we?

12:48.006 --> 12:50.241
I say we get Guantanamo
on his ass.

12:50.275 --> 12:52.911
Give us ten minutes with him, he'll
spill his guts on Latif no problem.

12:52.945 --> 12:55.780
And she becomes what? Just another dead
woman we've sacrificed for the cause?

12:55.814 --> 12:58.592
Would he talk?
Or would he just sit there

12:58.617 --> 13:00.319
thinking about how
his daughter was suffering

13:00.320 --> 13:03.856
and beg you to hit
him even harder?

13:03.890 --> 13:07.126
Well, fuck it. Find out where she is,
we'll go and do a snatch-and-grab.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.163
The Janjaweed are nomadic.
They could be holding Clare anywhere.

13:10.198 --> 13:13.133
No. We need Crawford to
offer them cash instead of arms.

13:14.302 --> 13:15.369
I want them to
bring her to us.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.604
Where?

13:17.239 --> 13:18.272
Darfur.

14:02.681 --> 14:03.914
Clare,
just leave it.

14:03.948 --> 14:06.383
He will be one
of them soon.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.185
Like all of the
children they take from us.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.455
No. Najim, no, stop it!

14:13.157 --> 14:14.925
Don't!

14:14.959 --> 14:17.261
You don't have to do this,
none of you have to do this!

14:19.964 --> 14:21.432
Get off me!

14:49.227 --> 14:56.134
My name is Tahir. And if you insist
on provoking my men like this,

14:57.369 --> 15:00.071
they will behave like men.

15:06.946 --> 15:10.081
This is gris-gris.

15:11.017 --> 15:14.486
Yes. He gave them to me.

15:18.557 --> 15:20.058
I will take them.
No.

15:20.092 --> 15:21.125
Clare...

15:27.332 --> 15:31.236
I will give them to you.
As a gift. To keep you safe.

15:33.405 --> 15:36.708
I have enough protection,

15:36.742 --> 15:42.147
not least in the shipment of
arms your father is sending me

15:42.181 --> 15:46.484
to ensure you return unharmed.

15:49.989 --> 15:53.792
When the guns arrive,
you will be released.

15:53.826 --> 15:59.964
But until then, you will earn your
food and water by treating my men.

15:59.998 --> 16:02.300
We will. Thank you.

16:06.205 --> 16:08.773
I need only one doctor.

16:10.543 --> 16:13.311
No! No, Bakri!

16:13.346 --> 16:16.448
Bakri!
No, sweetheart!

16:16.482 --> 16:17.782
Subin!

16:17.817 --> 16:21.719
And sadly, his father
is worthless.

16:23.455 --> 16:25.389
You bastard!

16:27.326 --> 16:31.296
No! No! No!

16:31.330 --> 16:35.233
Bakri! Get off me! No!

17:01.060 --> 17:04.029
I can't believe we're
doing this shit.

17:04.063 --> 17:06.765
We won't let him supply weapons,
but he can give them this cash

17:06.799 --> 17:08.999
to buy those same weapons
someplace else?

17:09.034 --> 17:11.868
As long as it gets us intel
on Latif, what do you care?

17:11.903 --> 17:13.837
Matak's already here.
He's waiting for us in the restaurant.

17:13.871 --> 17:16.806
The Janjaweed
eat in hotels?

17:16.839 --> 17:20.943
Matak is the government minister
conducting negotiations on my behalf.

17:20.978 --> 17:24.981
As far as he's concerned, you're
my employees, so act accordingly.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.215
If he even guesses at
the truth, it's over.

17:28.852 --> 17:30.486
Cocksucker.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.955
Well, dip me in shit
and call me Colonel.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.491
Now I know I've got a story.

17:36.526 --> 17:37.726
Damien?

17:38.662 --> 17:40.229
Who is that?

17:40.263 --> 17:42.331
A journo. War zone junkie.
We fucked a couple of times.

17:42.366 --> 17:43.366
Get rid of her.

17:44.534 --> 17:45.434
Hey, Maggie.

17:45.469 --> 17:46.936
What are you doing here?

17:46.970 --> 17:48.971
Just give me the
headlines. Is it juicy?

17:49.006 --> 17:50.139
Should I grab the table
next to you and make notes?

17:50.174 --> 17:51.975
No, no, no.

17:52.009 --> 17:54.411
Uh, why don't we make this a
liquid lunch, for old times' sake?

17:54.446 --> 17:57.515
Oh, what about your friend?
Is he coming too? He looks kinda fun.

17:57.549 --> 18:00.284
Well, he's English.
So, no, on both counts.

18:00.318 --> 18:01.518
Now, I seem
to remember...

18:09.627 --> 18:14.430
Ah, Captain Crawford, my
friend.  <i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

18:14.464 --> 18:18.133
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i> Mr. Sinclair,
Mr. Stonebridge,

18:18.902 --> 18:21.070
Matak Achmed.

18:21.138 --> 18:25.442
You understand we have to be conscious
of security in these troubled times.

18:27.412 --> 18:30.981
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

18:31.016 --> 18:33.017
They have killed one
of the hostages.

18:38.690 --> 18:43.160
Not your daughter,
<i>subhanallah,</i> but another doctor.

18:43.194 --> 18:48.265
I have warned you we are dealing
with a very volatile man.

18:48.299 --> 18:51.601
This will not be an easy
matter to resolve.

18:56.839 --> 18:58.473
I think we're going to
need a bigger case.

19:01.744 --> 19:03.146
Is it Special Ops?

19:03.171 --> 19:05.848
You going to render Bashir?
Make him stand trial for war crimes?

19:05.849 --> 19:07.316
Snatch the President
of Sudan?

19:07.350 --> 19:10.418
Well, why not? He's already
been indicted by the courts.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.821
Everyone knows the Janjaweed
operates on his say-so.

19:12.855 --> 19:14.289
True.

19:14.324 --> 19:15.524
Cheers.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.562
Something's going down. I've
been seeing you guys all over lately.

19:20.596 --> 19:21.796
What guys?

19:22.564 --> 19:24.965
Mercs. PMC assholes.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.200
Here.

19:27.502 --> 19:30.137
He look like a
tourist to you?

19:30.172 --> 19:31.805
I swear I've seen him
in fatigues somewhere.

19:32.674 --> 19:33.741
Do you recognize him?

19:34.676 --> 19:37.311
Wasn't Iraq, was it? Kosovo?

19:39.380 --> 19:41.348
The snake guy's a
Russian called Grigor.

19:41.382 --> 19:42.649
Right. Where'd
you take these?

19:42.684 --> 19:45.252
Some shebeen, not
far from here.

19:45.287 --> 19:47.021
You want to tell
me where it is?

19:47.055 --> 19:49.491
Quid pro quo.

19:49.525 --> 19:52.661
Who are those guys you were with?
What was in those cases?

19:52.695 --> 19:53.929
Heh.

19:53.964 --> 19:55.698
Hey, what did
you just do?

19:57.034 --> 19:58.568
Well, I'm going to find
out who that guy is,

19:58.602 --> 20:01.204
then I'm going to the place
where you took those photos.

20:02.106 --> 20:03.373
Catch you later.

20:03.407 --> 20:06.542
That was not the deal
and you know it.

20:13.684 --> 20:16.052
Hey, I got a driver.

20:17.188 --> 20:17.954
Awesome.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.322
Jacoub!

20:19.356 --> 20:22.993
Hey hottie, it's me. We
good to talk dirty again?

20:23.027 --> 20:24.828
Yes, the line is secure.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.563
They're chewing over
the bribe now.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.598
I got a photo to
send you. Love ya.

20:30.768 --> 20:32.101
Get me an ID.

20:40.878 --> 20:41.745
They don't mind
if you don't.

20:44.315 --> 20:46.449
My name is Jacoub.
You are American also, yes?

20:46.483 --> 20:49.118
I have made arrangements
for the exchange.

20:49.153 --> 20:52.188
We are meeting them
at noon tomorrow.

20:52.222 --> 20:54.089
You have the weapons
ready to deliver?

20:54.123 --> 20:55.223
No.

20:57.994 --> 20:59.761
But I have this as
collateral.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.403
And a sign of my good faith
in concluding the deal.

21:22.653 --> 21:25.121
But Tahir will want weapons.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.195
And he'll get them,
I promise.

21:33.598 --> 21:36.366
When I have my daughter
back safe and unharmed,

21:36.401 --> 21:38.969
I will release the
weapons immediately.

21:39.003 --> 21:40.170
They'll be nearby.

21:42.306 --> 21:47.944
Now, there is one suitcase for Tahir,
and this one will be for you alone,

21:47.978 --> 21:52.314
for all your endeavors in ensuring
that our two parties meet as arranged.

21:52.349 --> 21:55.183
My deepest gratitude, as
always, to a true friend.

21:55.752 --> 21:56.751
Salut.

22:00.890 --> 22:03.293
What the hell was that?
You're offering them weapons now?

22:03.327 --> 22:05.362
You've seen what we're
dealing with.

22:05.396 --> 22:07.931
If I'd said we had no arms, what do
you think they'd do to Clare, huh?

22:07.966 --> 22:10.768
This way, at least I've
made sure they'll bring her.

22:10.803 --> 22:12.937
Crawford, you tell me what happens
when they find out the truth.

22:13.005 --> 22:14.907
This was your fucking plan.

22:14.941 --> 22:18.577
If she dies, if you've killed her
by stopping that shipment...

22:27.120 --> 22:28.554
I lost her once.

22:29.923 --> 22:33.458
Fifteen years ago, when
her mother took her.

22:36.496 --> 22:38.130
I'm not gonna
lose her again.

22:47.007 --> 22:48.207
All right.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.145
We'll get her back.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.781
No matter what it takes.

23:11.166 --> 23:13.166
So that's
it over there.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.701
You want Jacoub to wait?

23:20.408 --> 23:22.309
Oh, shit, that's him!

23:23.878 --> 23:24.712
<i>I have an</i>
<i>ID on that photo.</i>

23:26.214 --> 23:29.116
The man's name is Andre Botha.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.771
He's a South African mercenary

23:30.796 --> 23:31.996
frequently hired by Crawford's
private security firm.

23:34.222 --> 23:35.322
He's been playing
us all along.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.293
No shit.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.565
We gotta follow him.
Let's go. Okay.

23:44.599 --> 23:46.134
Uh-uh. Not yet.

23:47.503 --> 23:49.537
Jacoub, get out.
I'm driving.

23:49.571 --> 23:51.405
Not until you tell me
what this is all about.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.207
Maggie, not now. I'll tell
you while I'm driving.

23:53.241 --> 23:54.708
Jacoub, get out
of the car.

23:54.742 --> 23:56.109
No! What's in it for me?

23:57.946 --> 23:59.079
You better
talk fast.

23:59.113 --> 24:01.048
Get out of
the fucking car.

24:01.082 --> 24:02.616
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.

24:02.651 --> 24:03.984
This is my car!

24:04.019 --> 24:05.953
So get in.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.022
You are such a piece
of work, you know that?

24:08.089 --> 24:09.189
Maggie, not now.

24:12.794 --> 24:16.162
Yeah, we've been compromised.
We need to extract the principal.

24:16.196 --> 24:19.098
No, we can't risk them
aborting the exchange.

24:19.132 --> 24:21.400
I've got a tail to shake,
I'll see you later. Out.

24:24.572 --> 24:25.905
Shit.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.141
He's made us.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.883
You couldn't just do what
I say, could you?

24:35.918 --> 24:37.985
Always gotta put the squeeze on, and
try and get something for yourself.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.421
Sound familiar?

24:39.455 --> 24:41.356
If we lose him, I'm never
gonna sleep with you again.

24:41.390 --> 24:42.424
Ever!

24:42.458 --> 24:44.292
Like I'd miss those
three seconds.

24:46.929 --> 24:47.963
What is happening?

24:47.997 --> 24:50.098
Plan B. Buckle up.

24:57.139 --> 24:58.773
He was there,
man, I'm telling you.

24:58.807 --> 25:01.143
That fucking man from the
shipyard is tailing us.

25:05.248 --> 25:06.615
Fucker.

25:08.886 --> 25:10.620
I see them!

25:10.654 --> 25:11.688
I see!
Yeah, I got 'em.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.526
Where the fuck's he
gone? Do you see him?

25:15.560 --> 25:16.761
Negative.

25:19.498 --> 25:20.598
You wanna hold on?

25:26.472 --> 25:27.638
Fuck!

25:43.190 --> 25:44.223
That hurt?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.197
What do you got here, huh?

25:51.600 --> 25:54.602
Fuck me. You guys are
tooled up for a war!

25:56.138 --> 25:57.472
Yeah.

25:57.506 --> 26:00.074
All right. Thank
you very much.

26:01.543 --> 26:02.577
You all right?

26:02.611 --> 26:04.545
You fucking son
of a bitch!

26:04.580 --> 26:05.446
Yeah, you sound fine.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.881
You?

26:06.915 --> 26:07.948
My car!
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

26:07.983 --> 26:09.516
I'll buy you a new one.
My car!

26:09.550 --> 26:13.219
You! Get out of the car.
Get out of the fucking car right now!

26:13.253 --> 26:14.720
Leave it.

26:20.861 --> 26:21.628
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

26:21.662 --> 26:23.230
Jacoub, get in!

26:39.583 --> 26:43.252
I've taken two of 'em out.
I got their weapons, but I'm t.

26:43.287 --> 26:47.624
That guy in the photo with the snake
tattoo is a Russian called Grigor?

26:47.658 --> 26:50.193
He's a Chechen.
Grigor Tchevsky.

26:50.227 --> 26:52.896
We're cross-referencing
border controls.

26:52.930 --> 26:55.365
Andre Botha, Grigor Tchevsky,

26:55.399 --> 26:57.634
<i>and a third mercenary,</i>
<i>Casper Bryce.</i>

26:57.668 --> 27:00.236
<i>They all flew into Khartoum on</i>
<i>the same flight two days ago.</i>

27:00.271 --> 27:02.472
We're sending the information
to Stonebridge now.

27:02.506 --> 27:03.439
Major.

27:03.474 --> 27:05.308
Room service.

27:06.911 --> 27:08.278
We haven't ordered anything.

27:08.312 --> 27:11.414
It's for Mr. Crawford.
Compliments of the hotel.

27:11.449 --> 27:13.350
Why don't you leave it outside,
we'll collect it later.

27:16.054 --> 27:17.388
He needs to sign for it.

27:18.957 --> 27:20.191
Just a moment.

27:21.593 --> 27:23.561
Shut
the door for him.

27:29.969 --> 27:32.971
There's one other man,
just off to the side. Get ready.

27:33.005 --> 27:34.373
What are you going to use?

27:34.407 --> 27:35.374
They brought it with them.

27:35.408 --> 27:37.075
Okay.

27:37.109 --> 27:39.177
Hi, come in. Come on in.

27:56.295 --> 27:57.328
Nice work.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.310
You really should pay your driver more.
This place is a hovel.

28:13.612 --> 28:15.314
I have to deliver these.

28:17.383 --> 28:18.550
Sorry, buddy.

28:19.652 --> 28:20.652
I know it's your home.

28:21.521 --> 28:23.221
This is just a room.

28:24.424 --> 28:25.490
They were my home.

28:32.866 --> 28:35.101
Janjaweed.

28:35.136 --> 28:37.203
He had a farm, once.

28:38.172 --> 28:39.739
They destroyed that, too.

28:45.379 --> 28:47.147
Quite a gash you
got on your head.

28:49.150 --> 28:50.383
Let me have a
look at that.

28:52.553 --> 28:54.521
Oh, yeah.

29:53.411 --> 29:58.080
When I found out Clare was working
in Sudan I approached Matak,

29:58.115 --> 30:01.250
and bribed him to have
her visa revoked.

30:01.285 --> 30:03.119
Instead he had her abducted.

30:04.255 --> 30:06.323
He played distraught,
of course.

30:06.357 --> 30:08.321
Promised to personally
liaise with the Janjaweed

30:08.346 --> 30:09.973
to broker the deal
to get her back.

30:10.429 --> 30:11.462
For a fee.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.368
So, you see, if I hadn't made
him aware of her value,

30:20.974 --> 30:22.692
I couldn't trust that
they'd deliver her to me

30:22.717 --> 30:24.217
even once they had the weapons,

30:24.244 --> 30:26.813
so I had Dieter prepare
a covert team to

30:26.838 --> 30:29.084
plan to be at the
exchange just in case.

30:29.182 --> 30:31.650
They were in place
before my arrest.

30:31.685 --> 30:34.620
What they've done since is without
my knowledge or guidance.

30:37.591 --> 30:39.124
How many others are
on the team?

30:42.362 --> 30:45.298
Two more. Dieter and Andre.

30:49.303 --> 30:51.103
They've both been
taken out.

30:54.741 --> 30:57.142
Then Clare's in
your hands now.

31:01.481 --> 31:02.781
<i>My whole life,</i>

31:04.617 --> 31:08.119
everything I have done has
been a "fuck you" to his wars,

31:08.153 --> 31:10.354
and the blood money he's
made from fueling them.

31:13.124 --> 31:15.558
And now he's
using it all to save me.

31:17.594 --> 31:19.729
Well that is not saving me.

31:21.599 --> 31:23.266
Not like that.

31:25.136 --> 31:26.837
Please, not like that.

32:14.355 --> 32:17.424
That man that you murdered,
where are they taking him?

32:17.458 --> 32:19.359
To a wadi near here.

32:19.394 --> 32:21.161
It is almost full.

32:22.463 --> 32:25.498
But there is still room
for a few more bodies.

32:25.533 --> 32:27.466
He's my fiance.

32:27.501 --> 32:29.568
I want to give him
a proper burial.

32:31.238 --> 32:35.140
And what will you
give me in return?

32:35.174 --> 32:37.308
Nothing you can't take.

32:44.651 --> 32:46.118
Colonel, it's Sinclair.

32:46.152 --> 32:48.387
<i>I think we should abort.</i>
<i>We're too exposed.</i>

32:48.421 --> 32:50.623
What about Stonebridge?

32:50.657 --> 32:53.159
He wants to continue. But I'm convinced
Crawford's double-crossing us.

32:53.194 --> 32:56.330
<i>We have no idea how many more</i>
<i>of these guys are out there.</i>

32:56.364 --> 32:58.465
All right. Stonebridge
knows what he's doing.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.167
<i>And we need that</i>
<i>intel on Latif.</i>

33:00.202 --> 33:02.369
Where's Scott?

33:02.404 --> 33:04.405
Gathering intelligence,
apparently.

33:04.439 --> 33:07.308
<i>He said he'll meet us</i>
<i>at the exchange.</i>

33:07.342 --> 33:08.909
Well, make sure
he gets there.

33:08.944 --> 33:11.178
It's Scott's job to
watch your back.

33:13.515 --> 33:15.916
Lucky me.

33:15.951 --> 33:18.652
Maggie, I said no.
It's too dangerous.

33:18.686 --> 33:20.879
Bullshit!
The arms dealer's daughter?

33:20.904 --> 33:22.704
That's like my
Pulitzer Prize right there!

33:22.723 --> 33:24.591
I said no!

33:24.625 --> 33:26.159
And I still think there's
more you're not telling me!

33:29.596 --> 33:30.730
Where's the car?

33:32.966 --> 33:34.533
Which car?

33:34.568 --> 33:36.468
The fuckin' car we
stole. Where is it?

33:37.804 --> 33:38.971
I took it back.

33:39.005 --> 33:40.473
You fucking kidding me?

33:40.507 --> 33:44.010
His driving license was
inside. With his address.

33:44.044 --> 33:45.452
I didn't know you
still wanted it.

33:45.453 --> 33:46.553
Of course I still want it!

33:46.554 --> 33:48.911
If I don't get to that exchange
point, people are gonna die.

33:49.084 --> 33:50.518
You understand that?

33:50.552 --> 33:52.420
Okay, so we'll just steal
another one, okay?

33:52.454 --> 33:55.657
Where from? The only transport
around here is a fuckin' goat!

33:55.692 --> 33:58.594
My neighbor has a car.
He will lend it to you, I promise.

33:58.628 --> 34:01.063
Come with me, and
show me, right now.

34:03.299 --> 34:04.799
You call this
piece of shit a car?

34:06.268 --> 34:07.468
Fuck.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.480
How long till we get there?

34:23.083 --> 34:25.217
Soon. Relax.

34:25.252 --> 34:27.418
Everything is prepared,

34:27.454 --> 34:29.054
is it not?

34:29.089 --> 34:30.289
Everything's prepared.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.030
Stonebridge?
We have new intelligence.

34:37.063 --> 34:39.699
We're cross-referencing
border controls.

34:39.734 --> 34:43.335
Another three of Crawford's men
arrived in Sudan yesterday.

34:43.371 --> 34:45.371
<i>Looks like you're</i>
<i>gonna have company.</i>

34:45.406 --> 34:46.606
All right.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.341
Problem?

34:48.375 --> 34:49.775
No.

35:40.295 --> 35:42.530
I have a visual
on the boss.

35:42.564 --> 35:44.401
<i>As soon as he</i>
<i>has his daughter, we take</i>

35:44.426 --> 35:45.845
<i>out the special forces.</i>

35:45.935 --> 35:47.269
Roger that.

36:32.584 --> 36:33.550
We spotted anyone?

36:35.653 --> 36:36.653
That abandoned bus.

36:37.589 --> 36:38.789
The barn.

36:41.293 --> 36:42.293
Maybe the walkway.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.231
I don't see anyone.

36:49.067 --> 36:50.601
Neither can I, but that's
where I'd put men.

36:52.270 --> 36:55.071
So what's my role? Apart
from sitting duck?

36:55.105 --> 36:57.373
You grab the girl. She'll
make a perfect shield.

36:57.408 --> 36:59.575
No one's going to shoot
you with her in the way.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.145
Doesn't sound
very chivalrous.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.014
But I like it.
Yeah, good plan.

37:05.049 --> 37:06.616
Where the fuck
are you, Scott?

37:12.824 --> 37:14.693
If you don't hurry up, you're
gonna miss the party.

37:54.333 --> 37:55.300
Crawford...

37:55.901 --> 37:57.068
Clare?

37:59.171 --> 38:00.171
Clare!

38:03.008 --> 38:05.276
It's okay. You're
gonna be fine.

38:08.514 --> 38:10.215
I'm gonna bring you
home with me.

38:22.362 --> 38:26.632
And the trucks? The shipment
of arms that you promised?

38:27.701 --> 38:28.834
Where are they?

38:29.569 --> 38:30.569
They're coming.

38:33.406 --> 38:35.307
When I have my daughter.

38:40.545 --> 38:42.780
Show me them. Now.

38:45.983 --> 38:50.487
He will bring them soon! And
offers this as collateral!

38:56.492 --> 38:57.592
Jacoub,
you got this?

38:57.626 --> 38:59.427
Hold this.
Sure.

39:09.071 --> 39:12.507
It is not money that
the UN denies us.

39:28.659 --> 39:31.194
I have the weapons.

39:31.228 --> 39:34.630
You'll get them shortly. Just give
me my daughter, take the money!

39:34.665 --> 39:36.266
I'll release them!

40:11.166 --> 40:14.235
This is what your
money has bought.

40:31.052 --> 40:33.921
A useful aid,

40:33.956 --> 40:38.093
for a father who will not
hear and does not listen.

40:38.127 --> 40:39.494
Kill him!

40:41.131 --> 40:42.164
Fucking kill them!

40:43.232 --> 40:44.232
All of them!

40:48.570 --> 40:49.737
Duck! Get down!

40:53.441 --> 40:54.608
Come on!

40:54.643 --> 40:56.577
Anyone hit?
No.

41:17.031 --> 41:18.199
Shit.

41:31.079 --> 41:32.179
Keep him alive!

41:32.214 --> 41:33.447
I'll do my best.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.527
Gotcha.

41:56.271 --> 41:57.705
Clare!

41:57.739 --> 41:58.739
Clare, to me!

42:05.181 --> 42:06.147
Clare!

42:09.518 --> 42:10.519
Get down to the ground!

42:16.660 --> 42:17.828
Fuck!

42:18.429 --> 42:19.595
Clare!

42:21.265 --> 42:22.298
Whoah, whoah, whoah!

42:23.600 --> 42:24.701
Just go back inside.

42:24.735 --> 42:26.102
Go back, it's all right.

42:26.137 --> 42:27.604
Stay inside. Fuck.

42:27.638 --> 42:28.905
What're you doin',
cocksucker?

42:28.939 --> 42:29.706
Where the fuck have you been?

42:29.740 --> 42:31.108
Saving your life!

42:32.210 --> 42:33.577
Clare! Stay down!

42:33.611 --> 42:34.645
Come on, Jacoub.

42:35.513 --> 42:36.647
Come on, buddy.

42:41.987 --> 42:42.720
Talk to me!

42:42.755 --> 42:44.122
You going for the girl?

42:44.156 --> 42:45.457
That's what
we came for, isn't it?

42:45.491 --> 42:46.558
Let's move!

42:46.593 --> 42:47.726
Comin' to ya!

42:51.231 --> 42:52.832
Cover me.

42:52.866 --> 42:54.233
<i>I'm going to</i>
<i>go in for the principal.</i>

42:56.603 --> 42:58.137
Clare, come here!

42:58.172 --> 42:59.171
Clare, move!

43:03.209 --> 43:04.243
Ahhh!

43:09.448 --> 43:11.349
Michael, the girl!

43:11.383 --> 43:12.416
Ahhh!

43:13.651 --> 43:14.818
Hang in there.

43:16.754 --> 43:18.121
Come on!

43:19.991 --> 43:21.158
Fuck.

43:25.563 --> 43:26.730
You get him?

43:27.665 --> 43:28.866
Oh, fuck!

43:51.455 --> 43:52.488
Shit.

43:54.758 --> 43:56.492
Did he get you?
Is he okay? Scott?

43:56.526 --> 43:57.660
Scott...

43:59.329 --> 44:00.562
Scott look here,
look here, look here!

44:00.597 --> 44:02.131
It's gonna be okay.

44:02.165 --> 44:03.799
Stay with me.

44:03.834 --> 44:04.900
Stay with me, Scott!

44:04.935 --> 44:05.968
Scott!

44:07.071 --> 44:08.237
Hey, Scott. Scott!

44:19.184 --> 44:20.218
What's that?

44:20.252 --> 44:21.986
It's uh, it's morphine.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.221
Oh, gimme. I love
that shit.

44:32.296 --> 44:33.363
Did we get the girl?

44:33.397 --> 44:34.397
No, not yet.

44:34.431 --> 44:36.298
Fuck.
Shit. He's bleeding out.

44:36.333 --> 44:38.133
You gotta get him to
a hospital, fast.

44:38.168 --> 44:39.568
- Come on, let's go!
- We're gonna patch you up.

44:42.105 --> 44:43.606
The fuck are you doing?

44:43.640 --> 44:45.641
I'm getting my daughter back,
and I'm taking that car.

44:45.676 --> 44:48.511
No! No.

44:48.545 --> 44:50.380
You need "a" car, and a better
car than this piece of shit

44:50.414 --> 44:53.216
if you have any hope of
getting across that desert.

44:53.250 --> 44:55.386
Now, my friends are
taking this,

44:55.420 --> 44:58.222
and you and I are taking one
of those Janjaweed technicals.

45:02.493 --> 45:04.661
Sinclair, take this gun in case
there's trouble along the way.

45:04.695 --> 45:05.929
You tell Grant what happened.

45:05.963 --> 45:07.864
Are you seriously going on?

45:07.898 --> 45:09.265
I have to find that
intel on Latif.

45:09.299 --> 45:11.166
Oh, like that's the reason
you're going, Mike.

45:11.201 --> 45:15.070
Come on. You're outgunned,
you got no backup, huh?

45:15.105 --> 45:17.305
How're you gonna even find her?
You don't know where the fuck to look.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.340
I do.

45:19.375 --> 45:20.942
What the fuck
is he saying?

45:20.976 --> 45:22.409
My village was near here.

45:22.444 --> 45:23.877
I can help you.

45:23.912 --> 45:26.246
All right. Let's all go.

45:26.281 --> 45:28.149
The morphine's kicking in.
I'm up for a road trip.

45:28.183 --> 45:31.085
No, you're going to a hospital
before you bleed to death.

45:31.120 --> 45:36.924
He, he's gonna die before
me. Stupid fucking Brit.

45:36.958 --> 45:39.426
Yo, there's tools in the back.
You go kick some ass.

45:39.460 --> 45:41.128
Thanks. Go.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.232
Drive.

45:54.510 --> 45:55.711
Let's do this.
