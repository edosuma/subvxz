I don't want a little mochachino
bambino runnin' around here?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.935
Of course I do.
But a girl can't just give up
on her dream.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.805
I did.
I could've skated in Nagano,
but Carlos knocked me up.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.808
I want a baby!
We're not talkin' about this.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.810
Oh, yes, we are.
I'll tell you what.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.848
We can talk about it
if you beat me in arm wrestlin'.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.052
I hate it when
we decide stuff this way.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.157
[ Earl Narrating ] That's when I
decided to stop bein' a watcher
and start bein' a doer.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.126
Joy wanted a baby in her belly,
but not in her life.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.896
And Liberty wanted a baby in
her life, but not in her belly.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.231
Of course, the catch was
how to convince two sisters...

11:38.298 --> 11:40.734
who hate each other
to make a baby together.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.736
[ Groans ]
[ Sighs ]

11:42.803 --> 11:45.973
All right. Let's wrestle.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.080
[ Earl Narrating ]
So I did my research
on surrogate babying.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.283
From what I learned
from the drawings,
it was definitely possible.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.419
And boobs look gross
without the skin.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.389
Are you guys done with this gum
on the side of the TV?

12:02.455 --> 12:05.258
Pink gum, yes.
Green gum, no.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.527
This surrogate baby thing
could really work.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.463
I just don't know how
to convince both women
to go for it.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.733
Be like tryin' to get Pepsi
to have Coke's baby.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.568
They're just
natural enemies.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.670
You just have to get them
so excited about the idea...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.540
that when they find out
who they have to do it with,
they won't care.

12:20.607 --> 12:24.077
Like how Patty,
the daytime hooker,
uses my picture for her ad.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.950
You're not the girl
in the ad.
You think you're disappointed?

12:30.017 --> 12:34.154
You should've seen the gay guy
who called expecting
a Greg Louganis type.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.456
It's a really good idea,
Catalina.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.960
I'll just get 'em
both so fired up,
they'll have to agree.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.666
[ Beeping ]

12:46.733 --> 12:48.836
[ Sniffing ]

12:53.006 --> 12:55.375
This egg represents you.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.410
[ Earl Narrating ]
I started with
Liberty and Ray Ray,

12:57.477 --> 13:00.280
explaining
the scientific process
of surrogate baby-making.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.382
And then you are
the mayonnaise.

13:05.585 --> 13:10.858
And all you do
is mix the two together,
and you got a baby.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.926
It's that simple.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.929
[ Earl Narrating ]
They seemed excited.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.898
Then I explained things
to Joy and Darnell.

13:17.965 --> 13:23.536
It's actually pretty simple.
You just take the stuff like
that and gently insert it.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.041
Ah. Like such.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.110
And then you wait
a little while.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.613
Okay, ding, ding, ding.
He's ready to come right out.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.249
[ Chuckles ]
And you got yourself
a little baby.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.419
[ Earl Narrating ]
Then they were into it too.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.155
As crazy as it sounds,
me explaining...

13:42.222 --> 13:45.025
a highly complex medical
procedure was the easy part.

13:45.092 --> 13:49.262
The final step was gettin'
everybody together. And that's
when things got ugly.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.698
You?

13:51.764 --> 13:54.667
You? Earl, if this is
who I'm supposed to meet,
we're done.

13:54.734 --> 13:58.405
I'd rather have a pit bull stick
a litter of puppies in me than
carry this woman's demon child.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.974
That pit bull would have to be
pretty drunk to knock you up!

14:01.041 --> 14:04.511
Okay, that's a nice icebreaker.
Now, let's stop right there
while the score is even.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.013
Slut!
Road whore!

14:06.079 --> 14:07.881
Okay, still tied, 2-2.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.484
Look, I know there's history
between you guys, but there's
also a lot at stake.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.988
Liberty, we're talkin' about
the opportunity to have
your dream career.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.857
What, the moon take
a night off so your butt
could eclipse the sun?

14:17.925 --> 14:20.894
For your information,
I'm auditioning for
the Black Ladies of Wrestling.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.131
- What's your little man's name?
- Oh, this right here
is Mr. Bearded Dragon.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.299
Yours?
Mr. Turtle.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.501
Call me if you're ever
interested in settin' up
a playdate.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.604
- Oh, that'd be nice.
- Fellas, stay with me here.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.307
Now, Joy, remember, you're
tryin' to stay out of prison.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.979
Prison? I guess I'll be rich
and famous while you're watchin'
me on TV from behind bars.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.481
Come on! Let's go!

14:43.283 --> 14:45.618

14:45.685 --> 14:48.956
I'm sorry, baby.
Sometimes I just respond
to yelling.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.560
[ Earl Narrating ]
My plan to get Liberty's egg
in Joy's turkey had failed.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.663
But I still had to do
what I could to help Liberty,

14:56.729 --> 14:59.432
so I got myself a seat
next to the talent scout
from BLOW.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.501
This next girl, Liberty,
is great.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.771
I'd pay large sums
of money to watch her
wrestle professionally.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.108
I'd buy a calendar
with her on it,
and/or an action figure.

Randy may have had
the perfect head for wrestling,

15:37.904 --> 15:42.409

a little too soft, and he just
couldn't take the booing.

Not wantin' to see

Strange as it seems,

this was
the longest these women
had ever talked to each other.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.403
And it was probably healthy
they were airin' out
their grievances.

And that was for payin'

But as painful as Joy's
prom stabbin' had been,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.646
Liberty had a much
deeper pain to share.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.518
This is for gettin' to grow up
with my daddy.

for every holiday!

that the only girl that got
to kiss him good night...

was his precious
little blonde-haired Joy!

Joy suddenly realized that
even though they were sisters,

Joy was the only one
who got to have a dad.

After swallowin' her pride
and a little blood,

together nursin' their wounds.

to always imagine Dad
bein' there with you...

was with the whole family
together on holidays,

I finally felt like I deserved
to cross Liberty off my list.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.189
By stealin' her credit card,
I had stolen her identity.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.359
But today I gave her
a new identity.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.094
She was a Black Lady

19:55.161 --> 19:59.599
She was also a lovin'
and carin' wife with
a really supportive husband.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.703
And with the help of an actual
doctor who used more than
mayonnaise and an eggbeater,

20:03.770 --> 20:07.274
she soon became
an expectant mother.

to try and make herself
more sympathetic to a jury,

20:11.678 --> 20:15.282
she got a new identity too--
a surrogate mom.

Even though Joy and Liberty
had called each other just
about every name in the book,
