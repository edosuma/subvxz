00:05.339 --> 00:07.466
Jesus, you mind?

00:09.010 --> 00:11.679
Oh, shit, man,
what is your problem?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.183
All right.
Would you just back up

00:16.267 --> 00:18.811
a little bit?
Thank you.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.063
You're both going
to nursery school,

00:21.147 --> 00:22.940
but you can't ever be in
the same room at the same time,

00:23.024 --> 00:24.358
and you're both named Amy now.

00:24.442 --> 00:25.609
Are you fucking my sister?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.278
Debbie and I are friends.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.864
Carl thinks if two women
are friends, they must be gay.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.240
<i>No, I think Debbie's
gay because she follows you</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:32.700
<i>around like
a little puppy dog.</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:33.909
<i>I'm not getting
total gay vibes,</i>

00:33.993 --> 00:35.119
but it's inconclusive,

00:35.202 --> 00:36.829
so...I'd say yeah,

00:36.912 --> 00:39.206
she'll probably eventually
end up gay.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.499
I think we should break up.

00:40.583 --> 00:41.542
Why, 'cause you love
my sister?

00:41.625 --> 00:43.002
No, because you're too clingy.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.253
Call me

00:44.336 --> 00:45.504
when you're not so needy.

00:45.588 --> 00:46.589
I'm pregnant.

00:46.672 --> 00:47.631
Are you sure it's mine?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.550
Yeah, I'm sure it's yours.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.926
The last thing I need
in my life

00:51.010 --> 00:52.219
is a man telling me
what to do.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.221
I really don't give a shit
about what you think,

00:54.305 --> 00:55.639
but I do understand

00:55.723 --> 00:57.516
that you might have
some feelings about this.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.894
If you decide to have
this baby,

00:59.977 --> 01:01.687
I want to make damn sure
it has a father.

01:01.771 --> 01:03.230
I own this house!

01:03.314 --> 01:04.940
The title is in my name!

01:05.024 --> 01:06.609
I'm not letting you live here,

01:06.692 --> 01:08.235
not with Liam
and not with Franny.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.570
Fuck you!

01:09.653 --> 01:10.905
Lip kicked you
out of the house?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.323
Yeah, you believe
that motherfucker?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.908
I'm carrying my shit around
in garbage bags.

01:13.991 --> 01:14.992
You're a bad drunk.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.660
When you drink, you get mean.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.454
A good drunk is fun.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.998
<i>A bad drunk
wants to have a fight.</i>

01:21.082 --> 01:22.208
<i>If you really love her,</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:24.126
and you really are her friend,

01:24.210 --> 01:26.462
<i>you won't let her stay
with you.</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:28.631
<i>She needs to hit rock bottom.</i>

What the fuck were you doing

in there?
You crazy?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.200
I was just--I just--calm--

03:19.283 --> 03:20.576
Get the hell out of here!

03:20.659 --> 03:21.619
You trying to get yourself
killed?

03:25.372 --> 03:26.707
Are you all right, man?

03:26.790 --> 03:27.583
Yeah.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.500
Are you sure?

03:28.584 --> 03:30.586
You went down hard.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.046
Joey, you better call
an ambulance.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.214
No, no.
No--

03:33.297 --> 03:34.965
No ambulance.
I'm fine.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.930
Are you sure, buddy?

03:41.013 --> 03:42.223
Yeah.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.933
I'm right as rain.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.186
Okay.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.484
I'm--

03:53.567 --> 03:54.860
I'm--I'm fine.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.994
I just bruised myself.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.815
Hey.
How was work?

04:32.898 --> 04:34.400
Long.
Franny asleep?

04:34.483 --> 04:36.735
<i>Yeah, I didn't hear
a peep all night.</i>

04:36.819 --> 04:38.362
She's up now.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.913
<i>Fuck off, Debbie.</i>

04:47.997 --> 04:49.456
Carl, it's Fiona.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.460
Come on, I gotta pee.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.132
Carl!

05:07.016 --> 05:08.350
What was that about?

05:08.434 --> 05:10.519
Kelly broke up with him.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.279
How much longer, babe?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.531
I think my calf
is starting to cramp.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.866
30 more seconds.

05:23.949 --> 05:24.992
30 seconds, and then

05:25.075 --> 05:26.327
we can make sweet, sweet love

05:26.410 --> 05:28.454
for hours and hours,
days, even.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.998
I am.
I am getting a cramp.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.207
Two weeks!

05:32.291 --> 05:33.292
Two weeks, baby,

05:33.375 --> 05:35.044
without your wonderfulness.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.503
Just a few more seconds.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.713
When the vasectomy doctor said

05:37.796 --> 05:38.881
you had to wait two weeks,

05:38.964 --> 05:40.507
I don't think
he literally meant

05:40.591 --> 05:42.343
- you had to wait for--
- Five, four--here we go.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.720
Two.
One.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.807
Oh...

05:48.891 --> 05:50.225
Okay.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.643
Take it a little easier.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.270
- Feels so good.
- Uh, I know,

05:53.354 --> 05:54.563
but we don't want

05:54.646 --> 05:55.647
to break the bed,

05:55.731 --> 05:57.066
or me.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.194
Oh.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.161
Kev?

06:12.331 --> 06:13.332
Did you just--

06:13.415 --> 06:15.125
Mm-hmm.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.212
Okay, then.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.140
Coffee?

06:30.224 --> 06:31.809
Almost.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.401
How you feeling?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.865
A little rough around the edges
in the morning.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.492
- You know?
- Sure.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.500
How's Xan?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.586
Uh, I might get to see her
in a couple days.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.714
Foster family signed off,
but I need DCFS approval.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.509
Wanna catch a meeting
this morning?

07:08.137 --> 07:09.805
Yeah, thanks.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.146
Here.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.147
Thanks.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.523
What happened to your face?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.524
Fryer at work.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.025
Don't pick.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.111
God, you'll make scars.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.406
Urlacher over Butkus?
No, not a chance.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.657
Butkus was an animal.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.867
Eight pro bowls.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.452
Hall of Fame.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.079
Have you checked out Butkus
on YouTube?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.749
Pre-concussion rules?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.626
He would've kicked
Khalil Mack's ass

07:39.710 --> 07:41.795
if they'd played together.
That's a fact.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.005
Okay.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.923
See you outside in five.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.717
Kelly.
We're going

07:46.800 --> 07:47.843
back-to-school shopping

07:47.926 --> 07:48.927
for guns and ammunition

07:49.011 --> 07:50.304
and things.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.430
Didn't you just get back home

07:51.513 --> 07:52.973
from working all night?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.933
Don't feel sleepy.
I'll catch it up later.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.060
Urlacher over Butkus.
Can you believe that shit?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.270
Uh, Franny?

07:58.353 --> 07:59.855
Taking her with.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.568
I gotta go.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.072
Lip Gallagher around?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.407
Uh, yeah, he's inside.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.492
Hey, watch your step.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.618
There's a homeless guy

08:12.701 --> 08:14.411
passed out on the sidewalk.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.041
He--a little help?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.256
Frank?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.426
I think I broke something.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.511
Something bad?

08:30.594 --> 08:31.386
Leg.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.638
Uh, you want to call 911?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.056
No.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.807
Help me inside.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.437
What's Frank doing out here?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.231
Uh, he says he broke
his leg or something.

08:42.314 --> 08:43.857
Won't let me call 911.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.234
Hey.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.568
Hey.

08:46.652 --> 08:47.945
Hi.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.239
Carl.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.701
Is that blood?

08:54.785 --> 08:57.037
It's just a scratch.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.667
That's bone.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.589
Help me inside.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.638
For fuck's sake.
Someone grab his arms.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.056
I'll grab his good leg.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.558
Come on.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.726
Easy, easy, easy.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.146
will you fucking--ow.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.107
Oh, God.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.734
Hello!

09:27.818 --> 09:29.361
Is Lip around?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.113
Uh, I think he might--

09:32.197 --> 09:33.156
Um...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.241
Uh, hi,

09:34.324 --> 09:35.826
Mr. Tamietti.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.578
You and I need to talk, son.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.162
Oh, yeah?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.372
Tami's having this baby,

09:40.455 --> 09:42.165
and I need to know
what your plan is.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.627
Uh, she's--she's keeping
the baby?

09:45.711 --> 09:46.962
I mean,
she seemed undecided

09:47.045 --> 09:48.463
- the last that we, uh--
- Oh, yeah.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.340
She's keeping the baby.
That's not open

09:50.424 --> 09:51.508
for discussion.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.510
No, no, sir.
I just mean, um,

09:53.594 --> 09:56.096
last time we talked,
she--she seemed unclear

09:56.179 --> 09:57.347
about what she wanted to do.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.807
Oh, it's clear.
She's having the baby.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.392
Good God.
Almost there.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.311
- A little help here!
- Okay, okay, okay.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.395
Put me down.
Put me down, no more.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.813
Down there! Down there!

10:04.896 --> 10:06.315
Jesus.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.357
What happened?

10:07.441 --> 10:08.191
He busted his leg.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.526
Is that bone?

10:09.610 --> 10:10.986
What the fuck?
Why didn't you

10:11.069 --> 10:12.070
call an ambulance?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.030
He wouldn't let us.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.072
The hell is that?

10:14.156 --> 10:15.657
Mollies...

10:15.741 --> 10:17.534
- A few personal items.
- ...And acid.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.493
Is that why
you didn't want

10:18.577 --> 10:19.453
to call an ambulance?

10:19.536 --> 10:20.746
Uh, who the hell is that?

10:20.829 --> 10:21.955
Our dad.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.123
Why doesn't he want
an ambulance?

10:23.206 --> 10:24.249
Because the paramedics

10:24.333 --> 10:25.667
would've emptied his pockets,

10:25.751 --> 10:27.294
found the drugs,
and called the cops.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.545
Uh, you know, Mr. Tamietti,
why don't we go get

10:28.629 --> 10:29.838
a cup of coffee
or something, yeah?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.548
I had an opportunity
to invest

10:31.632 --> 10:34.176
some of my Ingrid
severance money, and I took it.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.260
If you're done hiding
your stash,

10:35.344 --> 10:36.928
can I call 911?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.430
Not until my associates come

10:38.513 --> 10:40.849
and we complete
our transaction.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.017
I gotta go to work.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.728
Yeah, we should go, too.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.937
I'll give
your associates

10:46.021 --> 10:47.189
five minutes.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.440
Then I'm calling 911.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.942
Borrow your phone?

10:54.529 --> 10:56.615
- Mail.
- Ah, I'm late for--

10:56.698 --> 10:58.116
work.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.627
Ah, crap.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.753
I forgot the stroller.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.296
Take her.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.130
Excuse me.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.423
Excuse me.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.882
Move.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.277
Frank again?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.447
Yeah.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.676
Open femur fracture.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.470
Definitely going
to need surgery.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.223
I'm in a lot of pain here.
Could I get 15 of morphine?

12:45.307 --> 12:48.101
No can do, Frank.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.186
Lidoc--

12:49.269 --> 12:50.395
is that lidocaine?

12:50.479 --> 12:51.563
Yep.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.732
Ah, come on, guys!

12:53.815 --> 12:55.776
You got any fentanyl in there?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.319
That'd take the edge off.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.612
Can give you
a bite block

12:58.695 --> 13:01.031
to chomp down on
if you like.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.365
A bite block?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.326
What are you,
the Marquis de Sade?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.536
Best I can do after last time.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.165
I did not steal drugs
from your ambulance.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.083
I saw you take it, Frank.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.877
Are you sure you don't want
that bite block?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.338
This might sting.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.423
Fuck you, Quincy.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.682
Personally, I would've taken
the bite block.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.144
You want to ride
with him again?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.896
How long's the wait
at County this morning?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.106
Pro hockey season's shorter.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.775
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ouch!
- Okay.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.110
Let me get my purse and tell
my brother we're leaving.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.529
Easy, easy, easy, e--

13:40.612 --> 13:41.613
Keep whining, Frank,

13:41.696 --> 13:42.823
and I'll find every pothole

13:42.906 --> 13:43.907
between here and County

13:43.990 --> 13:45.283
to bounce you over.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.827
Hey, Liam?

13:46.910 --> 13:49.246
I gotta take Frank
to the ER,

13:49.329 --> 13:52.415
so you have to make
yourself breakfast, okay?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.042
Hey.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.677
Liam?

14:11.810 --> 14:14.187
You want Tabasco?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.939
Eight seconds.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.278
It's only been two weeks
since the surgery, babe.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.821
Give it some time.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.076
12-year-olds
last longer.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.413
All right, girls, finish up.
It's almost time for school.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.791
Is this what it's gonna be like
from now on?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.042
Eight seconds?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.460
You really think
we need to be having

14:37.544 --> 14:38.962
this conversation
in front of the girls?

14:39.045 --> 14:41.548
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.
That's me now.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.509
Mr. Kevin Ball,
the "wham, bam" man.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.469
Okay, girls.
Dishes in the sink

14:46.553 --> 14:48.305
and backpacks.
Let's go.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.061
I'm so sorry I let them
cut you guys.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.479
Can you ever forgive me?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.398
You're gonna live, baby.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.734
It's one tiny incision.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.535
<i>Wait for Mommy.</i>

15:12.078 --> 15:14.080
Oh, God.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.419
Your sister coming again
this morning?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.463
She said she was, yeah.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.468
Tami's dad showed up
at my house this morning.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.261
- Bob?
- Yeah.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.888
Shit.
What did he want?

15:29.971 --> 15:32.057
Wants to know my plan.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.141
You have a plan?

15:33.224 --> 15:34.434
No.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.727
Tami's made it very clear

15:35.810 --> 15:37.771
that I'm not allowed
to have one.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.814
Don't fuck with Bob.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.441
He's tougher than he looks.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.902
He said Tami's
definitely having the baby.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.529
That's the Tamiettis.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.740
Old-school Catholics.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.785
Big families
and fish on Fridays.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.245
She tell you she was going
to see a doctor today?

15:55.413 --> 15:56.581
No.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.917
This afternoon.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.170
Asked Cami to go,
but she's working until 6:00.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.422
W-what kind of doctor?
Did she say?

16:04.506 --> 16:05.882
Nope.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.843
Tami likes to stick it
to her dad.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.721
Could be she's getting ready
to solve your problem.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.183
It's starting.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.267
Yeah.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.497
All right.
Coke,

16:37.580 --> 16:39.249
crackers, and a bedpan.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
Barb's saying three hours,
but could be five.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.211
I can't stay the whole time.
I got a meeting.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.839
Oh, Christ.
AA?

16:45.922 --> 16:49.384
Did you let Lip recruit you
into that cult?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.469
Meeting with a public defender.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.722
Trouble with the law?
Excuse me.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.598
I've got a bone
sticking out of my thigh.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.560
Does this look
like a scam to you?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.103
Hey, doc.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.355
Could you hook a brother up
with a little morphine

17:02.439 --> 17:03.940
for a broken femur?

17:04.024 --> 17:05.900
Come on, I--

17:05.984 --> 17:08.862
Ah, that's right.
Just walk on by, Osama.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.739
We'll have your ass
on that plane

17:10.822 --> 17:12.532
and back
to Crap-sanistan

17:12.615 --> 17:15.368
as soon as the president
revokes your H-1B visa.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.787
More bees with honey, Frank.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.205
This is nothing but torture

17:19.289 --> 17:20.832
and payback.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.250
You signed a Hippocratic Oath,

17:22.333 --> 17:23.376
for fuck's sake.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.544
Doctors have been convicted

17:24.627 --> 17:25.503
of war crimes

17:25.587 --> 17:26.588
for what you're doing to me.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.089
How did this happen, anyway?

17:28.173 --> 17:29.799
I was taking a brief nap

17:29.883 --> 17:31.760
in that shithole
you used to own,

17:31.843 --> 17:34.929
and they started
tearing it down around me!

17:35.013 --> 17:36.347
My apartment building?

17:36.431 --> 17:38.099
I woke up with a--
a wrecking ball

17:38.183 --> 17:41.728
trying to decapitate me!
I had to run for my life.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.689
I should sue the bastards.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.733
You were drunk, trespassing,

17:46.816 --> 17:48.735
and sleeping
in a boarded-up building, okay?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.653
I don't think a lawsuit
is likely to go your way.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.613
Never know.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.572
They may settle

17:52.655 --> 17:53.990
to avoid a court case.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.075
Hey.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.160
You got anything useful
in there?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.536
Eh, a Quaalude?

17:58.620 --> 17:59.621
Maybe an oxy?

17:59.704 --> 18:00.622
No.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.124
Miss!

18:03.208 --> 18:04.209
Excuse me.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.460
I'm in quite a bit

18:05.543 --> 18:06.544
of, uh, discomfort

18:06.628 --> 18:07.796
with this open fracture.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.756
I know the doctors
are incredibly busy,

18:09.839 --> 18:11.716
but could you ask one of them

18:11.800 --> 18:13.301
to prescribe something
for the pain?

18:13.384 --> 18:14.886
I don't need much.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.347
20 of morphine
would be more than enough.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.807
You're Frank, right?

18:18.890 --> 18:19.808
Yes.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.142
No.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.187
Your reputation
precedes you.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.439
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

18:26.523 --> 18:28.483
You wouldn't treat
a dog in the street like this!

18:28.566 --> 18:29.442
Mr. Gallagher?

18:29.526 --> 18:30.276
- Yes!
- Here!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.153
Yeah.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.490
So, Mr. Gallagher,

18:35.573 --> 18:38.660
I see you visited
our hospital in the past.

18:38.743 --> 18:39.994
Yes, once or twice.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.371
52 times, actually,

18:41.454 --> 18:42.747
and you have
no insurance.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.542
Unfortunately not.
Um...

18:45.625 --> 18:48.753
Difficulty securing employment
in this challenging economy.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.463
Unemployment rate is under 4%.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.549
We're hiring janitors
without hands.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.926
I have
five different birthdates

18:55.009 --> 18:56.678
and four different
middle initials

18:56.761 --> 18:57.887
in your records.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.807
Are you over 65,
Mr. Gallagher?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.016
Do you need me to be?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.477
If you're over 65,
you qualify for Medicare.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.354
Free hospitalization, drugs...

19:06.437 --> 19:07.897
Yes, I'm over 65.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.858
Just had a birthday.
Put that down.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.818
When were you born?

19:11.901 --> 19:15.446
January 16th, 19...

19:15.530 --> 19:16.656
54.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.949
...54, exactly.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.576
Do you have ID I can use

19:19.659 --> 19:21.202
to verify that date of birth?

19:22.871 --> 19:24.038
Maybe.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.251
I found that at a Dairy Queen.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.753
I've been meaning
to return that.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.051
It says you were born in 1936.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.928
Makes you 83.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.930
I try to take care of myself.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.893
Someone will be over
to examine you shortly.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.103
I gotta go soon.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.024
- <i>Hey, Fiona.</i>
- Hey, Debs, are you home?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.483

19:56.863 --> 19:58.031
He's not answering his phone?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.490
No.
Straight to voice mail.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.409
Can you track him down,
make sure he can get in?

20:01.492 --> 20:02.493
<i>Yeah, sure.
No problem.</i>

20:02.577 --> 20:04.120
Okay.

Oof.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.855

20:30.939 --> 20:32.857
Two hundred girls,
ten bathrooms.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.901
It's survival of the fittest.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.444
How long have you been
going there for?

20:36.527 --> 20:38.238
Since my mom ran off
with a gunnery sergeant

20:38.321 --> 20:39.489
when I was nine.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.532

Nope.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.365
All set, Mrs. Thompson.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.075
Okay.
I'll be in the kitchen

22:06.159 --> 22:07.618
if you change your mind.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.209
Don't you think
they might be worried?

22:15.293 --> 22:17.462
Took them two days
to realize I was gone.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.172
Can't be too worried.

22:31.893 --> 22:34.520
Why the long face,
little pirate?

22:34.604 --> 22:35.772
Nothing.

22:35.855 --> 22:36.898
Come on.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.941
You can tell
your Auntie Lori.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.194
I gotta make sure
my favorite first mate's head

22:41.277 --> 22:42.445
is in the game.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.530
Happy cooks
make happy meals.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.824
I didn't make it past
the first round of cuts

22:46.908 --> 22:48.034
for West Point,

22:48.117 --> 22:49.160
and my lesbian sister

22:49.243 --> 22:50.495
is in love with my girlfriend,

22:50.578 --> 22:52.163
trying to turn her gay, too.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.373
Wow.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.208
World's really stomping
on your dreams, huh?

22:56.751 --> 22:58.044
When God hands you lemons,

22:58.127 --> 22:59.712
you just gotta squeeze
that juice

22:59.796 --> 23:01.506
into the wound
and enjoy the pain.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.840
Ma'am?

23:02.924 --> 23:04.217
You're my star.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.094
Pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

23:06.177 --> 23:08.137
get right back up
on that horse.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.014
Horse, ma'am?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.183
Right back into
that saddle, huh?

23:15.478 --> 23:16.729
Hello?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.398
Anybody?

23:19.023 --> 23:22.110
Ah, come on!
I have to set myself on fire

23:22.193 --> 23:24.112
to get some attention
around here?

23:24.195 --> 23:25.780
Please do!
I'll bring the matches

23:25.863 --> 23:27.156
if you bring the gasoline.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.699
About damn time.
How'd you do

23:28.783 --> 23:30.868
on the back nine, doc?
Even par?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.371
How you been, Frank?
Taking care of that new liver

23:33.454 --> 23:34.956
someone was stupid enough
to waste on you?

23:35.039 --> 23:36.666
- Hm.
- So, what is it

23:36.749 --> 23:37.917
this time?
You're speaking,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.335
so I'm gonna rule out

23:39.419 --> 23:40.920
an overdose
or alcohol poisoning.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.380
Broke an appendage.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.674
Hurts like hell.
Could you hook me up

23:44.757 --> 23:46.926
with a healthy helping
of your favorite opiate?

23:47.009 --> 23:48.094
You haven't had anything yet?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.971
Not a damn thing.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.472
Your coworkers
have been tighter

23:51.556 --> 23:54.016
than a miser
at a March of Dimes fundraiser

23:54.100 --> 23:55.309
with the pain relief.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.936
Couldn't even rustle up

23:57.019 --> 23:58.646
a Tylenol 3 with codeine.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.857
Ow.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.983
That's bone.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.943
That's what I've been saying!

24:04.026 --> 24:07.280
Congratulations, Frank.
You hit the jackpot this time.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.739
You get a quick trip
to the OR

24:08.823 --> 24:11.451
and copious amounts
of intravenous narcotics.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.244
Hey, Maggie.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.163
Call up to surgery
and find out who's okay

24:15.246 --> 24:17.331
with not getting paid today.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.083
You were drunk?

24:19.792 --> 24:20.793
Yes.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.254
You initiated the assault?

24:23.337 --> 24:25.006
I only punched her once.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.430
You fractured her cheekbone.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.432
You have a previous
felony conviction?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.602
- Yeah.
- Well, it's not much

24:37.685 --> 24:39.520
of a defense to present.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.063
You're
a convicted felon,

24:41.147 --> 24:42.773
you were drunk,
you attacked a woman

24:42.857 --> 24:43.983
without any provocation

24:44.066 --> 24:45.151
in front of a dozen witnesses.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.028
No, there was provocation.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.864
She--she called the cops
on my ten-year-old brother

24:49.947 --> 24:51.782
for selling lemonade
in front of her house.

24:51.866 --> 24:52.867
Why would she do that?

24:52.950 --> 24:54.368
My brother's black.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.120
You have a black brother?

24:56.954 --> 24:58.456
Yeah.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.585
DA may be reluctant to put that

25:02.668 --> 25:04.253
in front
of a black Chicago jury.

25:04.754 --> 25:05.963
We might be able
to plead it down

25:06.047 --> 25:08.508
from a felony
to a misdemeanor.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.677
Will I have to do time?

25:11.761 --> 25:12.887
Depends.

25:12.970 --> 25:13.971
You employed?

25:14.055 --> 25:15.640
I'm looking.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.724
What about AA?

25:16.807 --> 25:17.808
Yes.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.854
Okay, I'll talk
to the DA.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.105
Thank you.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.815
But Miss Gallagher,

25:24.899 --> 25:26.776
the judge is gonna want
to see proof that you are

25:26.859 --> 25:29.529
a contributing member
of society, so no alcohol,

25:29.612 --> 25:32.031
and get yourself a job,
any job.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.908
Yes, ma'am.

25:33.991 --> 25:34.992
Just a drill,

25:35.076 --> 25:37.161
children.
No need for panic.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.788
Line up behind your teacher

25:38.871 --> 25:40.915
in a straight line.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.458
Straight lines,

25:42.542 --> 25:43.751
James McPherson!

25:43.834 --> 25:44.877
Abby Zoldan,

25:44.961 --> 25:47.463
does that look like
a straight line?

25:47.547 --> 25:50.049
Gus Accord, stop eating sand
from the sandbox

25:50.132 --> 25:51.717
and get in line,
please.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.344
Here we go.
Line up.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.179
Go to your number.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, Amy Ball?

25:59.809 --> 26:01.811
I have to go back in.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.313
Can you get in line
behind Sister Anne, please?

26:04.397 --> 26:05.398
I can't.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.774
I have to go back

26:06.857 --> 26:08.359
in my cubby.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.444
Why do you have
to get back in your cubby?

26:10.528 --> 26:11.904
So you don't see us.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.072
See who?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.923
There's two of you?

26:34.218 --> 26:37.388
Eight seconds?
Whew, that's rough.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.140
Yeah.
My cousin Ronnie

26:39.223 --> 26:41.309
never recovered
from his surgery.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.019
Been ten years.
He still has to wear

26:43.102 --> 26:44.395
one of those adult diapers.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.521
From a vasectomy?

26:45.605 --> 26:47.231
No.
Prostate.

26:48.649 --> 26:51.485
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.654
I'm just saying.
It's never a good idea

26:53.738 --> 26:55.364
to let doctors near
your man parts

26:55.448 --> 26:57.325
with anything sharp.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.909
I thought you guys were gonna
help cheer me up.

26:58.993 --> 26:59.827
Okay.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.037
Okay.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.080
Did sex still feel good?

27:04.749 --> 27:05.916
Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.418
Great.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.711
It was quick, but good.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.962
So enjoy that.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.589
Lots of guys don't get any.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.549
- Be happy with quick.
- Yeah.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.593
Cousin Ronnie can't get it up
at all anymore

27:15.676 --> 27:17.303
since the surgery.
He has to use

27:17.386 --> 27:18.763
one of those pump things.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.139
Enough about Cousin Ronnie,
would you,

27:20.222 --> 27:21.057
Kermit, please?

27:21.140 --> 27:22.141
Eight seconds with you

27:22.224 --> 27:23.184
is like eight hours

27:23.267 --> 27:24.352
with anyone else, baby.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.312
Short but sweet.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.314
Very short.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.567
You just had
the vasectomy, baby.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.235
You'll be back to your regular

27:33.319 --> 27:34.695
ten seconds in no time.

27:34.779 --> 27:35.988
Oh, damn.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.198
Oh, burn.

27:37.281 --> 27:38.491
Oh.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.660
Alibi.

27:41.535 --> 27:42.828
Yes, Sister?

27:45.081 --> 27:46.415
Yes, I understand.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.710
Thank you.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.796
Absolutely.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.425
What?

27:57.134 --> 27:58.511
The nuns know.

28:05.810 --> 28:06.977
Hey.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.815
How long you been waiting here
like a creepy stalker?

28:10.898 --> 28:12.149
Not long.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.526
Bullshit.
Carla saw you out here

28:13.609 --> 28:16.237
a half-hour ago.
She wanted to call the cops.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.740
So my dad find you
this morning?

28:19.824 --> 28:21.450
Yeah, he came to my house.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.411
Yeah?
And what'd you two boys decide?

28:23.494 --> 28:25.329
Am I having this baby
or not?

28:26.372 --> 28:27.873
He says you're keeping it.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.667
He did, huh?

28:29.750 --> 28:31.460
Good to know.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.587
Oh, so you're not?

28:33.671 --> 28:35.381
I just needed him off my ass.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.967
- All right, then you are.
- Jesus, what is it with men

28:38.050 --> 28:39.760
trying to tell me what to do
with my own body?

28:39.844 --> 28:41.679
I'm not trying to tell you
what to do.

28:41.762 --> 28:42.930
All right?
I'm just confused.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.391
He made it sound
like your decision was made.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.685
Well, he doesn't know shit.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.812
All right, then.
Good?

28:52.022 --> 28:53.190
So are we done?

28:57.111 --> 28:58.738
Where are you going?

29:00.406 --> 29:01.657
Where am I going?

29:01.741 --> 29:02.992
Yeah.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.411
The doctor's.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.663
Who told you?
Brad?

29:07.747 --> 29:08.748
Yeah.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.167
And you want to come?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.585
Yeah, if you want me to.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.420
I don't, or I would have asked

29:14.503 --> 29:15.880
you to in the first place.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.465
All right, you know,
go fuck yourself, Tami.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.049
Fuck me.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.136
Lip.
Lip!

29:22.219 --> 29:24.180
- Lip!
- What?

29:25.806 --> 29:27.224
We're already here.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.530
Liam?

29:42.490 --> 29:44.241
Liam, you home?

29:49.330 --> 29:50.456
You want a beer?

29:50.539 --> 29:52.750
Yeah, absolutely.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.923
Whee.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.758
I'll be right back.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.845
Damn, girl!

30:07.807 --> 30:09.850
Ah.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.102
If I'm gonna be a sailor,

30:12.186 --> 30:13.395
I gotta learn
to drink like one.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.983
A-cheers.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.489
So what do you want to do
in the Navy?

30:23.572 --> 30:24.949
I'm gonna fly jets.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.451
Like, off aircraft carriers
and stuff?

30:27.535 --> 30:29.328
That's the idea.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.042
That is so cool.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.506
What are you doing?

30:40.589 --> 30:41.590
Gotta break them in

30:41.674 --> 30:42.883
before school starts.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.010
These things destroy your feet

30:45.094 --> 30:46.762
if they're not broken in.

30:46.846 --> 30:50.140
Come on!
Join me.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.267
Okay.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.905
Hey, Fiona.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.782
Hey.
You get ahold of Liam?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.367
<i>No. I'm sure</i>

31:08.450 --> 31:10.244
he forgot
to charge his phone again.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.537
What are you doing?

31:11.620 --> 31:12.580
I'm jumping up and down
with Kelly.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.622
What are you doing?

31:13.706 --> 31:15.207
Ah, applying for jobs

31:15.291 --> 31:16.375
I don't really want.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.459
<i>Well, I'm home now,</i>

31:17.543 --> 31:18.377
so Liam will be able

31:18.460 --> 31:19.420
to get in when he comes.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.547
All right.
Thanks.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.849
How you feeling, Frank?

31:31.932 --> 31:35.644
Well, I had a rather nice buzz
going there for a bit,

31:35.728 --> 31:37.521
but it's starting to fade.
Think it's time

31:37.605 --> 31:39.106
to hit me up with the real

31:39.189 --> 31:40.649
knock-you-on-your-ass stuff.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.109
We've been experimenting

31:42.192 --> 31:44.486
with Oriental medicine
pain management,

31:44.570 --> 31:46.238
so we thought we'd skip
the anesthesia

31:46.322 --> 31:48.574
and just pop a few acupuncture
needles in your head,

31:48.657 --> 31:49.909
and see how that works.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.493
What?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.203
I'm just fucking with you,
Frank.

31:53.287 --> 31:55.205
You shoulda seen your face.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.752
This is Dr. Wilde.
He's gonna be

31:59.835 --> 32:01.670
your surgeon today.
Youngest graduate

32:01.754 --> 32:04.548
of Yale Medical School
in over 100 years.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.634
Top of his class, too.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.594
How old are you now, Noah?
20?

32:08.677 --> 32:10.429
- Twenty-one.
- Hmm.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.264
Graduated high school
when he was 12.

32:12.348 --> 32:15.935
This is the first week
of his ortho residency.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.479
We were very lucky
to find Dr. Wilde on call today.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.272
Nobody else was willing
to do it.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.774
Thought we were going to have
to Dermabond your femur

32:21.857 --> 32:23.943
and just dump you
back out on the street.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.904
But not to worry.
Dr. Grey will be the attending.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.197
Where is Dr. Grey?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.531
Stuck in traffic
on the Dan Ryan.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.075
Said to get started
without him.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.785
Have you done this before?

32:32.868 --> 32:34.119
A comminuted femur fracture?

32:34.203 --> 32:35.871
Hell no.
Very exciting.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.082
We're a teaching hospital,
Frank.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.250
Residents working
on alcoholic deadbeats

32:40.334 --> 32:43.963
who don't pay their bills
is how young surgeons learn.

33:03.524 --> 33:04.858
Hey.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.568
Was everything fine?

33:09.154 --> 33:10.948
Peachy.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.286
What kind of doctor's office
was that?

33:16.370 --> 33:19.915
There's no baby stuff around
or anything.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.751
I need a drink.
Do you want to get a drink?

33:25.421 --> 33:27.923
Right.
No, I'll see you.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.437
I'm off to the bank.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.272
Aww, still down, little man?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.398
Yeah, a bit.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.777
Want a quick blowie
or a handy-J to perk you up?

33:48.861 --> 33:51.280
I was just kidding, kiddo.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.740
Manager-employee intimacy

33:52.823 --> 33:55.951
is a big no-no
in the new employee handbook.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.703
It's a shame, really.
Sex used

33:57.786 --> 33:59.204
to be <i>pro forma</i> in fast food.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.957
Jizz and hair nets went
together like mustard and mayo.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.085
Hell of a stress relief
after a big lunch rush.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.754
I'll be back in about 20

34:06.837 --> 34:08.297
if you can just watch
the register

34:08.380 --> 34:10.799
while I'm gone,
my salty little biscuit.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.721
Good call on the blowie.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.765
I let Lori go down on me once.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.266
She had most of her fist
up my ass

34:19.349 --> 34:21.435
and chewed on my dick.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.437
Woman's an animal.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.076
Welcome to Captain Bob's,
matey.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.161
How may I help you?

34:39.244 --> 34:40.662
Give me the fucking money.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.206
Is that a.32?

34:42.289 --> 34:43.916
The fucking money, shithead!

34:43.999 --> 34:45.417
- It's pink.
- The bullets

34:45.501 --> 34:46.543
aren't pink, motherfucker!

34:46.627 --> 34:48.295
Give me the goddamn money!

34:48.378 --> 34:50.547
Okay, you know what, asshole?
Pull the trigger.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.508
My life couldn't get
any fucking worse.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.511
Yeah, that's right.
Pull the motherfucking trigger.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.304
God fucking--

34:58.972 --> 35:00.390
Fucker

35:00.474 --> 35:02.184
piece of fucking shit!

35:02.267 --> 35:04.853
West Point, motherfucking...

35:04.937 --> 35:07.439
Lesbian sister piece of shit!

35:21.578 --> 35:23.664
Hi.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.249
I saw the "Help Wanted" sign.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.417
It's minimum wage, nights.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.755
Is there an application
or something I can fill out?

35:34.299 --> 35:35.843
$11.99.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.764
- All right, thanks.
- You still here?

35:43.142 --> 35:44.476
I need a job.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.570
Thanks.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.323
Just to be clear,
have you been sending

35:58.407 --> 35:59.700
two children to our school

35:59.783 --> 36:01.410
for the price of one
for months?

36:01.493 --> 36:02.661
We're very sorry, Sister.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.746
You only had space
for one girl, so--

36:04.830 --> 36:05.664
So you committed fraud

36:05.747 --> 36:07.291
and conspired to deny

36:07.374 --> 36:08.792
the Sisters of Faith, Hope,
and Charity

36:08.876 --> 36:11.545
the revenue we send
to our sister order in Ghana

36:11.628 --> 36:13.255
to help fight leprosy.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.090
Leprosy?
Really?

36:15.174 --> 36:17.092
That's bad.
That's when your skin

36:17.176 --> 36:18.844
- falls off--
- I got it, Kev.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.179
We're very sorry, Sister.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.388
After much prayer,
we've come up

36:21.471 --> 36:22.472
with two possible ways

36:22.556 --> 36:25.475
for us to resolve
this sad situation.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.355
$1,400?

36:30.439 --> 36:32.482
Your back tuition,
plus interest.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.443
By Friday, or we call the cops.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.696
And what's
the other possible way?

36:41.366 --> 36:42.993
We need a Jesus
for the Festival

36:43.076 --> 36:45.037
of St. Felicity pageant
next weekend,

36:45.120 --> 36:47.539
and Mr. Ball looks
like he works out.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.125
You want Kev to be Jesus?

36:52.878 --> 36:54.046
That's it?

36:56.173 --> 36:57.716
There is one small catch.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.637
Whoa.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.138
That's huge.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.890
And heavy.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.433
Mr. Polinsky made it himself.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.644
He paid for a pew,
so we've been afraid

37:08.727 --> 37:10.562
to tell him no one can lift it.

37:10.646 --> 37:12.689
So I gotta get nailed up or it
or something?

37:12.773 --> 37:15.234
No.
Carry it on your shoulder,

37:15.317 --> 37:17.486
as Christ did on his way
to Golgotha.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.922
Our last Jesus
got a hernia.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.216
Uh, yeah.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.802
So how far do I gotta carry it?

37:41.885 --> 37:43.887
From the school to the church.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.555
That's gotta be
a hundred yards.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.015
More like 150.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.061
$1,400, Kev.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.690
Fuck this.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.610
I went to get a test done.

37:59.319 --> 38:02.197
The doctor was
my mom's oncologist.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.120
Cancer.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.456
<i>BRCA.</i>

38:14.835 --> 38:17.129
It's a gene, moron.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.589
I went to find out
if I inherited

38:19.673 --> 38:21.091
a genetic mutation from my mom

38:21.174 --> 38:24.094
that means I'm probably gonna
die of breast cancer.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.930
Little gene might even throw in
ovarian cancer, free of charge,

38:27.014 --> 38:28.724
just to make sure
I'm good and dead.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.225
And?

38:30.309 --> 38:32.894
Don't find out the results
for a couple days.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.231
Oh...

38:38.233 --> 38:39.568
I'm sorry.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.279
Yeah, it's a tough break
for me, huh?

38:47.701 --> 38:49.786
Want to know the real pisser?

38:49.870 --> 38:52.956
There are two variations
of the gene.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.916
If I have one,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.419
having babies reduces
my chances of getting cancer,

38:57.502 --> 38:59.254
but if I have the other...

39:01.631 --> 39:03.508
...Then having a baby
increases my chances

39:03.592 --> 39:05.719
of getting cancer.
Cami got the test

39:05.802 --> 39:07.804
a couple years ago,
and she's got

39:07.888 --> 39:09.765
the "baby good" kind
of death gene,

39:09.848 --> 39:13.226
so she got your buddy Brad
to knock her up right away,

39:13.310 --> 39:15.812
and Cory took the test,
and Daddy's little princess

39:15.896 --> 39:17.356
is, of course,

39:17.439 --> 39:18.857
clean as driven snow.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.817
And you've never been tested
before.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.863
Fuck no.
Why would I want to know

39:24.946 --> 39:26.823
if I'm gonna live or die?

39:29.659 --> 39:32.788
Can the doctors do anything
if you have the gene?

39:37.501 --> 39:38.877
You know what?
Let's eat.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.796
I am fucking famished.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.537
<i>Hi.</i>

40:13.620 --> 40:15.789
<i>My name is Fiona,
and, uh,</i>

40:15.872 --> 40:18.166
I'm not sure
if I'm an alcoholic.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.460
Hi, Fiona.

40:20.544 --> 40:23.004
I know I'm supposed to say
I'm an alcoholic,

40:23.088 --> 40:26.299
but I--I don't really know.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.844
I have been going
through a really rough time

40:28.927 --> 40:30.429
the last couple months,

40:30.512 --> 40:33.056
and I've been drinking too much
to get by...

40:35.142 --> 40:37.769
...But I haven't had trouble
with alcohol before.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.772
There's a lot of reasons
to think

40:40.856 --> 40:43.066
that I could be an alcoholic.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.610
My mom was a junkie,

40:45.694 --> 40:49.030
and my dad's a drunk
and an addict.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.408
My brother's an alcoholic,

40:51.491 --> 40:53.076
and I love him to death.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.540
So I guess I should be here,

40:58.623 --> 41:00.250
you know, just in case.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.172
Thanks for listening.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.882
You're welcome.

41:20.187 --> 41:23.315
Hi, my name is Tony,
and I'm an alcoholic.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.867
Fuck.

42:09.236 --> 42:11.321
Oh, holy shit!

42:11.404 --> 42:12.405
What are you doing?

42:12.489 --> 42:13.907
I'm sorry.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.409
I'm not gay.

42:16.493 --> 42:18.828
No, I know.
That was a mistake.

42:20.622 --> 42:24.584
I'm--I am--
I mean, I wish I was,

42:24.668 --> 42:26.169
because if I were, I would--

42:26.253 --> 42:28.421
I would totally be into you.
You're great.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.173
Yeah, no.
Thanks.

42:31.633 --> 42:33.468
Oh, shit.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.303
I totally led you on.
I am--

42:35.387 --> 42:38.139
I'm so sorry.
We--we can still be friends.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.350
Yeah, absolutely.

42:42.936 --> 42:45.272
I should probably get going
and let you sleep,

42:45.355 --> 42:46.690
'cause you worked last night,
right?

42:46.773 --> 42:48.525
Yeah, I did.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.569
You should.

42:53.363 --> 42:54.906
I'll call you later, okay?

43:12.799 --> 43:14.467
Shit.
That thing looks

43:14.551 --> 43:16.803
like it weighs
at least 300 pounds.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.471
How far are you supposed
to drag it?

43:18.555 --> 43:20.515
From the school playground
to the church.

43:20.599 --> 43:22.100
You can't put wheels
on the end of it or something?

43:22.183 --> 43:23.184
The nuns said no.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.228
Jesus didn't have wheels.

43:25.312 --> 43:27.188
Oh.
Here's the wig.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.648
Jesus was a blond?

43:28.732 --> 43:29.858
No, Jesus was black

43:29.941 --> 43:31.067
and had nappy hair, but no one

43:31.151 --> 43:32.152
ever wants
to talk about that.

43:32.235 --> 43:33.278
Jesus wasn't black.

43:33.361 --> 43:34.863
African.
Hello.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.406
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

43:36.489 --> 43:37.490
Jesus was a Jew.

43:37.574 --> 43:38.700
Jesus was Jewish?

43:38.783 --> 43:39.826
King of the Jews.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.244
King of the Jews!

43:41.328 --> 43:42.662
Yeah, at first, maybe,

43:42.746 --> 43:44.164
but then he was Christian,

43:44.247 --> 43:45.665
because he was--

43:45.749 --> 43:47.584
well, because he was Christ,

43:47.667 --> 43:51.588
so he was the first Christ-ian.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.762
How do I look?

43:58.845 --> 44:00.889
You want the truth?

44:01.598 --> 44:02.849
Hey, if you're looking
to build

44:02.932 --> 44:04.351
your post-vasectomy stamina,

44:04.434 --> 44:06.436
lugging that fucker around
oughta do it.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.690
Kevin?

44:13.526 --> 44:14.861
The hell is that?

44:14.944 --> 44:16.446
I think it's your pants.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.454
Hey.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.498
I'm glad to see you here.

44:26.581 --> 44:27.624
Hi.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.459
Hi.

44:29.542 --> 44:30.919
Thanks.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.632
Uh, how's, uh, life at Patsy's?

44:35.715 --> 44:37.550
Eh, same old shit.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.552
Lily ran off with her boyfriend
to Portland,

44:39.636 --> 44:42.013
oh, and Juan--he got picked up
by ICE

44:42.097 --> 44:44.057
when he showed up at court
for a DUI.

44:44.140 --> 44:47.185
Shit.
Well, he's got a family, right?

44:47.268 --> 44:49.312
Yeah.
Couple of kids.

44:51.564 --> 44:53.316
Oh, I wouldn't.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.568
Coffee
at this meeting is shit.

45:03.118 --> 45:06.287
You might want
to check out Al-Anon

45:06.371 --> 45:07.706
if you're not sure about AA.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.249
Couple of us go to both.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.835
It's for people who have
family members who are drunks.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.294
There's a flyer over there

45:13.378 --> 45:14.713
with the rest
of the literature.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.174
I'll check it out.

45:20.552 --> 45:21.845
Keep coming.

45:21.928 --> 45:23.430
It works.

45:33.148 --> 45:35.066
Hey.

45:35.150 --> 45:36.860
How you feeling?

45:38.361 --> 45:40.238
Boy, it was a mess in there.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.073
Took six plates
and 18 screws,

45:42.157 --> 45:43.867
but I think we got
Humpty Dumpty

45:43.950 --> 45:45.076
put back together again.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.119
Pain.

45:46.202 --> 45:47.495
To be expected,

45:47.579 --> 45:49.164
but pain is your friend, okay?

45:49.247 --> 45:50.457
It's the body's way
of letting you know

45:50.540 --> 45:53.668
it needs time to rest
and to heal.

45:53.752 --> 45:54.836
Drugs.

45:54.919 --> 45:56.796
Drugs.

45:59.632 --> 46:01.217
Yeah.

46:01.301 --> 46:02.927
How'd it go?

46:03.011 --> 46:04.262
Uh, great.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.389
It was a distal
intra-articular fracture.

46:06.473 --> 46:08.141
Uh, extended up
into the femoral shaft.

46:08.224 --> 46:09.350
Difficult separating
the lateral--

46:09.434 --> 46:10.518
Yeah, that's wonderful.

46:10.602 --> 46:12.562
When can we boot
his ass out?

46:12.645 --> 46:14.272
Discharge him
from the hospital?

46:14.355 --> 46:15.482
Tonight, perhaps?

46:15.565 --> 46:17.358
Admin is refusing him a bed.

46:17.442 --> 46:18.526
Drugs!

46:18.610 --> 46:19.903
In the past 15 years,

46:19.986 --> 46:21.279
Mr. Gallagher has run up

46:21.362 --> 46:22.822
over $85,000

46:22.906 --> 46:24.783
in unpaid bills
at this hospital alone,

46:24.866 --> 46:26.910
not to mention another $32,000

46:26.993 --> 46:28.870
in outpatient services.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.330
But he's facing
three to six months

46:30.413 --> 46:33.416
of recovery.
Rehab, physical therapy--

46:33.500 --> 46:35.293
So we're agreed.
Tonight, then?

46:35.376 --> 46:36.669
He's still too weak.

46:36.753 --> 46:39.214
I need drugs!

46:39.297 --> 46:41.466
More drugs!

46:41.549 --> 46:42.884
He seems
to be regaining

46:42.967 --> 46:44.010
his strength.

46:45.929 --> 46:48.056
Just pump him full
of IV antibiotics

46:48.139 --> 46:50.099
and schedule a follow-up.
Send him home

46:50.183 --> 46:52.060
with 20 Oxy.
He'll be happy as a clam.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.062
Not to worry, doctor.

46:54.145 --> 46:56.439
Only two things will be left
roaming the Earth

46:56.523 --> 46:58.066
after the next apocalypse:

46:58.149 --> 47:00.819
cockroaches
and Frank Gallagher.

47:04.489 --> 47:07.200
Pain.
I'm feeling pain.

47:15.583 --> 47:16.584
Hey.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.336
Hi.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.644
That dinner?

47:34.727 --> 47:36.145
Yeah.

47:36.229 --> 47:37.564
Wasn't much in there.

47:41.442 --> 47:42.527
A baby?

47:42.610 --> 47:43.862
Maybe.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.324
Wanna talk about it?

47:48.408 --> 47:49.742
No.

47:49.826 --> 47:50.827
Not really.

47:53.955 --> 47:56.040
Sorry I missed the meeting
this morning.

47:56.124 --> 47:59.085
I got stuck taking Frank
to the hospital.

47:59.168 --> 48:00.753
You got to a meeting today,
though?

48:01.296 --> 48:04.007
I did, over at the rec center.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.175
Good.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.014
What's that?

48:12.140 --> 48:13.975
It's a Al-Anon flyer.

48:14.475 --> 48:15.935
It's--I picked it up
at the meeting.

48:16.019 --> 48:18.229
Twenty questions to see
if Al-Anon

48:18.313 --> 48:19.606
could be right for you.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.232
Yeah, how'd you do?

48:21.316 --> 48:23.943
Perfect score.
Twenty out of 20.

48:24.027 --> 48:25.862
"Have holidays or gatherings

48:25.945 --> 48:28.740
ever been spoiled
by a loved one's drinking?"

48:28.823 --> 48:30.158
Yeah.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.826
"Have you ever called
the police

48:31.910 --> 48:33.411
for fear of abuse?"

48:33.494 --> 48:35.788
The best ones
are at the bottom.

48:35.872 --> 48:38.958
"Do you feel more alive
in the midst of a crisis?"

48:39.042 --> 48:40.376
Mm-hmm.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.045
"Are you uneasy when your life

48:42.128 --> 48:44.505
is going smoothly?"
Mm-hmm.

48:44.589 --> 48:46.132
And my personal favorite:

48:46.215 --> 48:47.842
"Do you care for others easily,

48:47.926 --> 48:50.428
but find it difficult
to care for yourself?"

48:52.889 --> 48:56.225
You might need to start going
to two groups a day now.

48:56.309 --> 48:58.895
Yeah.
It's fucked up.

49:00.813 --> 49:03.524
I was doing so well
for a while.

49:05.234 --> 49:07.487
I really thought
I had a chance.

49:09.322 --> 49:11.074
You do have a chance.

49:15.912 --> 49:18.456
I don't know
if I believe that anymore.

49:22.210 --> 49:24.212
I don't know what happened.

49:24.754 --> 49:27.465
It just all fell apart so fast.

49:34.931 --> 49:37.350
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do now.

49:39.352 --> 49:41.646
Only thing you can do.

49:43.189 --> 49:44.941
You get back up.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.236
You start over.

49:50.029 --> 49:51.072
It's that easy, huh?

49:51.155 --> 49:54.534
No, it's fucking hard,

49:54.617 --> 49:56.119
but you're strong.

49:58.413 --> 50:00.039
Are you sure?

50:01.833 --> 50:03.459
Yeah.

50:04.419 --> 50:05.795
I'm sure.

50:16.806 --> 50:18.307
All right.
Shit.

50:18.391 --> 50:20.601
I gotta go work.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.353
Yeah, you got a new job?

50:22.437 --> 50:23.980
Yeah.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.815
Nights at the Valero.

50:25.898 --> 50:28.276
Ho, ho!
Starting from the top, huh?

50:28.818 --> 50:30.987
Hey, um,
did you ever find Liam today?

50:31.070 --> 50:32.739
No, but Debbie was here

50:32.822 --> 50:34.699
most of the day.
She might have.

50:34.782 --> 50:35.908
All right.

Kelly.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.420
I tried to kiss her,
and she...

52:57.508 --> 53:00.219
Why can't anyone ever love me?

53:00.303 --> 53:02.847
Come on.
That's not true.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.473
It is.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.058
Franny loves you.

53:06.142 --> 53:08.144
That doesn't fucking count.

53:11.981 --> 53:13.858
Someone shot at me today.

53:13.941 --> 53:14.942
What?

53:15.026 --> 53:17.028
Yeah, at work.

53:17.111 --> 53:18.988
I fucked him up.

53:19.697 --> 53:20.698
The cops come?

53:20.781 --> 53:22.950
Yeah.
Said I did a good job,

53:23.034 --> 53:25.828
but probably should've
just given him the money.

53:25.912 --> 53:27.663
It was only, like, 120 bucks.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.876
No shit.
You don't want

53:31.959 --> 53:33.711
to take a bullet
for Captain Bob.

53:35.004 --> 53:36.672
Guess I just kind of went crazy
on the dude

53:36.756 --> 53:39.008
after Kelly broke up with me,

53:39.091 --> 53:42.595
and getting that rejection
letter from West Point.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.681
You got a letter
from West Point?

53:45.765 --> 53:47.475
Yeah.

53:47.558 --> 53:50.061

Me, too.

54:00.780 --> 54:03.157
You know you'll find somebody.

54:03.241 --> 54:05.117
You think so?

54:05.201 --> 54:07.286
Yeah, definitely.

54:07.370 --> 54:10.122
Kelly's a bitch.
She likes to break hearts.

54:10.206 --> 54:11.749
She is a bitch.

54:13.459 --> 54:15.753
Yeah, we should go
fuck her up.

54:15.836 --> 54:18.839
She'd kick both our asses.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.263

54:25.346 --> 54:27.390

55:07.847 --> 55:09.348
Holy fuck.

55:11.726 --> 55:12.935
Hi, Max.

55:15.438 --> 55:16.689
$8.52.

55:19.191 --> 55:20.192
How've you been?

55:22.903 --> 55:24.238
I've been better.

55:24.322 --> 55:25.656
Yeah.

55:28.034 --> 55:30.328
Uh, listen,
I was meaning to call you.

55:30.411 --> 55:32.621
The zoning on that lot you're
a partner in got approved.

55:32.705 --> 55:35.833
Looks like the nursing
home's still gonna purchase it.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.668
You know, we still have
some due diligence to do,

55:37.752 --> 55:40.504
but should close the next six,
maybe 12 months.

55:42.298 --> 55:44.425
And can I get 50 bucks on six?

55:44.508 --> 55:45.676
Uh...

55:48.804 --> 55:50.056
I don't remember
exactly how much

55:50.139 --> 55:51.140
you have in the partnership.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.767
Something around $90,000?

55:54.018 --> 55:55.311
It's $100,000.

55:58.814 --> 56:00.566
What if I bought you out now?

56:03.069 --> 56:04.320
- What?
- Yeah.

56:04.403 --> 56:05.613
That way, you don't have to
wait a year

56:05.696 --> 56:06.739

and I don't have

56:06.822 --> 56:08.824
to waste my time

cheap wine out of this box.

56:13.579 --> 56:15.247
