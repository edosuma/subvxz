WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:12.303
[theme music playing]

01:04.773 --> 01:05.607
[whoosh]

01:40.391 --> 01:42.685
[whirring]

01:50.777 --> 01:52.237
[Hunk yawns]

01:53.029 --> 01:56.324
Okay, that's the third star system
we checked in the last 11 days,

01:56.407 --> 01:59.619
and we still haven't found
a single clue about any Robeasts.

01:59.702 --> 02:03.289
Actually, that was the 11th star system
in the last three days.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.708
Was it really? Oh, my gosh.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.254
Okay, see, I'm so worn out,
I can't even... you know.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.049
-Uh, count?
-No. Think.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.594
I know this is not ideal,
but the intel we received

02:16.678 --> 02:18.680
from the Galra cruiser in Lahn's fleet

02:18.763 --> 02:21.891
identified one of those Robeasts
within this quadrant.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.309
We must find it.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.147
Unfortunately, we just don't know
how current that information is.

02:27.689 --> 02:32.193
[Pidge] Also, this celestial quadrant
is 230,000 light-years in diameter.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.487
I can't even process what that means.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.158
Okay, picture five fleas
searching for another flea

02:38.241 --> 02:40.577
on a dog that's the size of Earth.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.496
Ugh, all this talk about fleas
is making me itchy.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.331
Are you guys feeling itchy?

02:45.623 --> 02:49.961
Pidge, why can't you and Hunk just make
a Robeast tracker thingy, you know?

02:50.044 --> 02:51.629
Do some math and science stuff.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.924
Then put some components together,
and bam, it's done.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.095
Perhaps we should set our heading
for the Altean colony.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.638
[Keith] We talked about this.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.058
To get to the colony, we would have
to travel through the Quantum Abyss.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.353
[Pidge] Plus, Kolivan said
the colony no longer exists.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.440
But there will be clues there,
something to go off of.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.941
Traveling through that abyss

03:12.025 --> 03:14.986
was one of the most harrowing
experiences of my life.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.613
A single misstep could turn

03:16.696 --> 03:19.157
a six-month journey
into a ten-year journey.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.201
The creatures, the environment,
everything in there wants you dead.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.579
-[Kosmo whining]
-Except you.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.250
I'm tired of hearing what we can't do
and what we don't know.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.586
[Lance] Allura, we just want to make
the best decisions--

03:31.669 --> 03:33.755
The Alteans were my people,

03:33.838 --> 03:37.508
and the last of them are being exploited
as soldiers in someone else's war.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.552
You don't understand.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.682
I understand what it feels like
to see someone I care about hurt so much.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.269
[sighs] I'm sorry, Lance.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.232
[Hunk] Okay, maybe we head to Olkarion.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.775
We're just a few galaxies away.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.569
They might have some information
on any unusual sightings.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.612
[Keith] Hunk's right.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.366
Olkarion is a great spot to regroup
and reevaluate our situation.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.160
And it'll be awesome
to see everyone again.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.954
I wonder what kind
of technological advances

04:06.037 --> 04:07.664
they've made in the last few years.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.251
Oh, man! If they figured out a way
to untangle the uncertainty principle,

04:11.334 --> 04:15.255
new precision calculations could open
the doors to a flood of innovations!

04:15.630 --> 04:18.049
I think I understood, like,
three of those words.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.302
[Keith] Allura, what do you think?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.681
Perhaps a trip to Olkarion is best.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.141
[Hunk] All right! Let's do this!

04:27.350 --> 04:30.103
[electronic chirping]

04:30.186 --> 04:31.312
Hailing Olkarion.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.856
Be advised the Paladins of Voltron
are en route.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
[static squealing]

04:39.237 --> 04:41.781
This is Pidge... hailing Olkarion.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.533
Do you copy?

04:43.908 --> 04:45.952
-[static squealing]
-Are they not home?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.705
Probably too busy untangling calculations.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.624
-Am I using that right?
-No, not even close.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.002
I'm guessing there's a delay
due to our distance.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.504
We'll probably receive their reply
on the way.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.549
Paladins, if we want to get
to Olkarion quickly,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.551
there's only one way to do it.
[grunts]

05:02.260 --> 05:03.553
[roars]

05:36.002 --> 05:37.003
[roars]

05:52.060 --> 05:53.436
Engage wings!

06:14.749 --> 06:17.335
Welcome to Olkarion's
galactic neighborhood.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.005
-Did we ever hear from them?
-[Pidge] Actually, no, which is strange.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.673
I'll try and contact them again.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.967
-[alarm beeping]
-Whoa! We got incoming!

06:25.301 --> 06:28.346
Something big is headed our way
at an incredible speed!

06:28.971 --> 06:31.265
[Lance] A Galra cruiser?
Some kind of weapon?

06:31.599 --> 06:32.850
[Allura] Is it a Robeast?

06:33.184 --> 06:34.143
Shield up!

06:41.234 --> 06:42.819
What the heck is that thing?

06:43.194 --> 06:44.070
It's a Weblum!

06:44.153 --> 06:46.280
Keith, look!
We've been inside one of those!

06:46.697 --> 06:47.865
How could I forget?

06:49.534 --> 06:52.870
-[Pidge] Um, what is it doing?
-[Hunk] It's creating scaultrite.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.414
Pidge, you would love it.
It's this amazing chemical process--

06:55.665 --> 06:58.126
Science talk later!
We're in its line of fire!

06:58.209 --> 06:59.043
Thrusters!

07:02.213 --> 07:04.090
-[Lance] Should we go on the offensive?
-[Hunk] No.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.801
They may be dangerous,
but they're essential for the universe.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.803
Think of them like giant space bees.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.264
Keith and I learned about them
from a video Coran made.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.515
There was some rule like,

07:12.598 --> 07:15.101
"If you don't want to be killed,
stay away from its gills"?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.853
That wasn't the rhyme.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.022
It's "If you don't want to be dead,
avoid its head."

07:20.106 --> 07:22.567
We don't have time to listen to you rhyme.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.819
-[laughs] You just--
-Hunk!

07:25.945 --> 07:27.613
[Allura] Where is that Weblum going?

07:28.823 --> 07:29.824
[beeping]

07:30.575 --> 07:33.453
According to my calculations,
it's headed towards...

07:34.287 --> 07:35.580
Olkarion.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.457
Then we better get there first.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.616
[wind howling]

08:20.082 --> 08:23.127
They were our allies, our friends.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.298
Paladins,
I know this is a difficult moment,

08:27.381 --> 08:28.883
but we need to get to work.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.094
That Weblum is headed here right now,
so time is short.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.430
Our top priority is search and rescue.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.724
If there are survivors,
we need to find them,

08:36.807 --> 08:38.518
and we need to find out
what happened here.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.771
There is only one thing capable of this.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.774
Well, let's confirm it.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.018
[Keith] I think our worst fears
have been realized.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.019
[Hunk] What do you see?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.564
The physical wreckage
and destruction patterns

09:24.647 --> 09:26.274
are just like those on Earth.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.693
Our findings are the same.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.904
It appears the Quintessence
was siphoned out of Olkarion as well.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.739
Lance and I took readings.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.158
We picked up trace elements of Psyferite.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.578
That's the same metal
the creature on Earth was made from.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.789
[Allura] Why did this Robeast
attack Olkarion of all places?

09:41.872 --> 09:44.584
Maybe because it was a central part
of the coalition.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.838
Maybe. I just get the feeling
there's something more to it.

09:49.797 --> 09:53.092
You might be right,
but we don't have any way to confirm it.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.429
Right now we just need to focus
on finding survivors.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.976
Pidge, have you picked up anything?

10:07.565 --> 10:08.941
Pidge, do you copy?

10:18.159 --> 10:18.993
Pidge?

10:19.535 --> 10:20.828
I know this place.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.083
This is where Ryner taught me
how to bond with the forest.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.838
The Olkari people helped me
to make that connection.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.133
I learned more from them
than I ever thought possible.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.972
Allura, they had so much more
to teach the universe.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.100
And now they're gone.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.144
[crying]

10:47.897 --> 10:50.816
-[girls' laughter echoing]
-Huh? Huh?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.196
[laughter continues]

10:56.614 --> 10:57.657
[Allura] Pidge.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.450
[laughter echoes]

11:00.159 --> 11:01.243
Are you all right?

11:02.078 --> 11:04.205
-You didn't see it?
-See what?

11:04.288 --> 11:06.749
The forest,
it was back to how it was before.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.209
There were girls playing.

11:09.043 --> 11:12.004
Maybe this place
is trying to show you something.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.255
What?

11:13.547 --> 11:16.884
The Olkari had a profound connection
to the land,

11:17.218 --> 11:18.427
just like you do.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.474
Their history could be etched
into the very soil for you to see.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.393
Concentrate.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.853
See if you can tap into its energy.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.945
-Come on! Follow me!
-[girls laughing]

11:39.865 --> 11:41.659
-Huh? [gasps]
-[sonic boom]

11:45.162 --> 11:46.622
We need to get to the city!

12:01.846 --> 12:04.557
[object roaring overhead]

12:06.892 --> 12:08.769
-[impact booms]
-[Pidge shouting]

12:11.814 --> 12:12.690
[gasps]

12:16.944 --> 12:19.363
[people shouting]

12:20.823 --> 12:21.740
[Pidge] Ryner.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.243
You can see Ryner?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.744
What is she doing?

12:34.253 --> 12:36.088
The Robeast! It's here!

12:43.179 --> 12:45.431
[grunting]

12:46.640 --> 12:48.142
We need to get closer.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.617
-[rumbling]
-[whimpers]

13:06.368 --> 13:07.244
[Pidge] Ryner!

13:08.078 --> 13:11.415
Get civilians to evacuation pods
and launch them immediately!

13:11.499 --> 13:14.418
Have all military personnel
report to battle stations.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.420
Scramble the mechs for counterattack.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.884
Come with me!

13:28.307 --> 13:29.141
Ryner.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.936
It seemed like
she was talking to me.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.981
Or it could have been to the soldiers.
I don't know.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.443
All the answers we're looking for
could be here.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.530
We may be able to find out
where this beast came from

13:42.613 --> 13:44.031
and where it's going next.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.743
There might be some clue here
about the Alteans.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.454
If there is, I will find it.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.750
[Hunk] Guys, we have a, uh--
We have a major problem here.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.504
Hunk released some low-orbit trackers
outside of Olkarion on the way in.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.214
The Weblum just set them off.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.258
We have about ten minutes to evac!

14:02.466 --> 14:03.425
Copy that.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.010
Everyone to their Lions.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.720
Let's go now!

14:07.012 --> 14:08.264
We can't leave yet.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.266
How long do you think you can hold it off?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.726
[Lance] Hold it off?
It's a giant space worm!

14:12.810 --> 14:15.020
We can't hold it off!
What are you talking about?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.898
[Allura] Pidge found a way
to tap into Olkarion's history.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.942
She may be able to find out
what we need to know,

14:20.192 --> 14:21.861
but we need a little more time.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.280
[Keith] All right, we'll buy you
as much time as we can.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.031
Copy that. Thank you.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.742
Hunk, Lance, we need to hurry!

14:29.034 --> 14:29.910
[beeping]

14:42.006 --> 14:44.508
-[beeping]
-I got it on scanners. Let's intercept it.

15:00.816 --> 15:01.650
[gasps]

15:01.734 --> 15:04.445
[powering up]

15:17.041 --> 15:18.459
-[Ryner] Go, go, go!
-[gasps]

15:19.418 --> 15:22.546
We need to preserve the information
from the communications tower!

15:22.713 --> 15:24.882
Keep the beast at bay as long as you can.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.269
We need to get it to divert its course.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.479
And how do we do that?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.565
[Hunk] How about like this?

15:42.816 --> 15:43.651
[groans]

15:47.279 --> 15:49.448
[Hunk whimpering] My idea isn't working!

15:54.745 --> 15:57.122
Okay, okay, well,
what were the rules with this thing?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.625
I'm drawing a blank.
I'm not good under pressure!

16:13.263 --> 16:14.974
It's still heading for Olkarion!

16:15.057 --> 16:16.558
We haven't slowed it down at all!

16:22.731 --> 16:23.565
[grunts]

16:30.948 --> 16:33.367
How did we not pick this thing up
on our scanners?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.870
-[female engineer] It just appeared!
-Just like on Earth.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.414
How could that be?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.749
Wait, bring up our scanner logs.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.710
Those anomalies we detected recently.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.461
[electronic chirping]

16:44.545 --> 16:46.588
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.467
The anomalies
are from the warping of space-time.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.054
[engineers grunt]

16:54.930 --> 16:57.850
This creature came through a wormhole.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.937
Transfer all data from this facility
to a safe location off planet.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.772
Then evacuate immediately!

17:04.023 --> 17:05.107
Understood.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.152
What we just discovered
could save billions of lives.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.153
[beeping]

17:10.654 --> 17:12.364
-[Robeast laser powering up]
-[beeps]

17:14.742 --> 17:16.243
[engineers shouting]

17:19.121 --> 17:21.165
It was a wormhole.
That's how they travel!

17:21.248 --> 17:22.166
[Hunk] Pidge, Allura!

17:22.249 --> 17:24.543
I'm sorry, but you've gotta
get out of there immediately!

17:24.626 --> 17:25.753
I need more time.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.547
[Allura] I'm coming up to help.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.216
[roars]

17:45.773 --> 17:47.983
Over here! This way!

17:50.277 --> 17:51.695
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:51.904 --> 17:54.907
Too close! How did you guys
beat this thing the first time?

17:54.990 --> 17:56.116
We never beat it.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.995
Trying to alter its course is a different
thing than collecting its scaultrite.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.997
[Hunk] That's it, I'm calling Coran.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.624
-Coran, come in!
-[beeps]

18:04.374 --> 18:05.751
Hunk! Hello there.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.836
Coran! You're there! Okay.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.715
Sorry, but we need to stop a Weblum
from eating a planet, like, right now!

18:11.799 --> 18:12.841
You know how to do that?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.052
Well, it's definitely been a while,

18:15.135 --> 18:18.847
but in my younger days, me and my cohorts
would have a little Weblum fun.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.266
Coran, we're kind of in rush here!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.434
Right. Let's see.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.561
If I remember correctly,
all you need to do...

18:24.645 --> 18:26.605
-[static hissing]
-...on the trilo-mutarth,

18:26.688 --> 18:28.107
which you'll find under its dorsal...

18:28.398 --> 18:31.026
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!
Not this again!

18:31.110 --> 18:34.154
-Our connection is breaking up!
-...resulting in face boils, a runny nose

18:34.238 --> 18:36.240
and cosmic light radiation poisoning.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.242
And if you don't do this,

18:38.325 --> 18:41.411
you'll expand to twice your size
and pop like a balvax.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.249
Okay, that conversation took
a lot longer than I expected,

18:45.332 --> 18:46.917
-and I learned nothing.
-[alarm beeping]

18:52.339 --> 18:53.924
[growls]

18:54.216 --> 18:56.593
Allura, thank you!

18:58.387 --> 18:59.972
[growls]

19:00.681 --> 19:02.099
Please hurry, Pidge.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.151
[Ryner] Hurry! Everyone on board.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.736
It came for something.
Find out what.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.364
-[booming footsteps]
-[gasps]

19:27.416 --> 19:29.126
[people shouting]

19:53.650 --> 19:56.069
It came for the cubes. Why?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.322
Ryner, can you hear me?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.657
Do you know why the beast
wanted the cubes?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.367
Please, talk to me!

20:02.451 --> 20:04.119
Hurry! Everyone on!

20:04.411 --> 20:06.788
Ryner, please. Ryner!

20:12.753 --> 20:14.963
[girl sobbing]

20:16.381 --> 20:18.967
I'm scared.
I don't want to leave!

20:20.219 --> 20:22.387
You mustn't cling too tightly to the past.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.557
The Olkari have always been able to adapt
and move forward.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.227
It is our greatest strength.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.896
And it will live on in you.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.066
[sobbing] But our home...

20:34.483 --> 20:36.318
The old must give way to the new.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.028
It's the way of the universe.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.989
Now, please, go.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.727
[Allura] Pidge! Pidge, are you there?

21:11.144 --> 21:13.105
We can't hold this thing off any longer.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.648
You need to get out of there!

21:25.033 --> 21:26.743
[booming]

21:29.121 --> 21:30.289
[grunting]

21:31.999 --> 21:34.251
[Hunk] There she is!
The planet is clear!

21:34.418 --> 21:36.795
Everyone fall back away from the Weblum!

22:08.618 --> 22:09.536
[Lance] It's...

22:10.287 --> 22:11.580
It's all gone.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.291
[Allura] I'm sorry, Pidge.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.293
[Keith] I wish we could've done more.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.419
Thanks, everyone.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.465
[Hunk] If you think about it,
this isn't really the end of Olkarion.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.301
Weblums eating dead planets
is just the first step

22:24.384 --> 22:27.888
in a process that leads to the growth
of new stars, planets and galaxies.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.308
The old gives way to the new.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.315
-We need to contact the Atlas.
-Why?

22:38.774 --> 22:42.194
[Pidge] Because it turns out the Olkari
weren't done teaching us a few things.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.238
They showed me a way
to track the Robeasts.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.950
Their information
is going to save billions of lives.
