00:03.525 --> 00:06.484
Need you to do a deep dive on
a person named Amelia Parsons.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.138
GREGORIO:
Amelia's Barlow's hit woman.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.226
She's like
the female Jason Bourne.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.055
You really are annoying.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.404
And you really are gonna put

00:13.448 --> 00:14.927
those hard drives
on the ground.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.494
Of course.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.457
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have Amelia.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.981
If it wasn't for you, she'd be
able to answer our questions.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.940
Instead, she's at the Mercy
Hospital in an induced coma.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.333
Thank you.
Let's have a toast.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.466
We can all drink
to whatever y'all want to

00:31.509 --> 00:33.294
as soon as I change
out of these clothes.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.513
Come on, hurry up.

00:35.557 --> 00:38.647
I know, I know, everyone's
waiting, I'm on my way.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.996
Just enjoying the view.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.012
WOMAN:
Dwayne?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.232
Dwayne.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.929
Dwayne, there's not much time.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.800
Come on, let's go.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.193
What

01:03.237 --> 01:05.021
Can't explain.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.110
It's not safe here.Something's happened.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.416
Is my team okay?They're fine.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.982
But we have to go now.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.202
Where?You'll see soon.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.770
You're CIA.
I know you, right?

01:14.813 --> 01:16.772
That's need-to-know.

01:16.815 --> 01:19.427
And all you need to know is that
I came at great personal risk

01:19.470 --> 01:20.993
to get you out.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.473
You have to trust me.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.823
Your name's Sutter.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.478
But you're dead.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.176
I found your body.

01:33.658 --> 01:36.313
I was hoping to make this
easier on you.

01:49.935 --> 01:52.112
I was shot.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.853
How did I survive?

01:54.897 --> 01:58.509
Oh, sweetie. You didn't.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.516
LASALLE:

Hey, Pride's been shot.
It's Amelia.

GREGORIO: Suspect's name, Amelia Parsons.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.106
She's armed and dangerous.
We need every unit you have,

03:57.149 --> 03:59.151
and we need to know where
that damn ambulance is.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.892
He's still bleeding. I don't
know where it's coming from.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.112
Need to turn him
on his side.You think we should move him?

04:03.155 --> 04:04.592
Yes.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.115
Carefully.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.638
Could have damage to the spine.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.032
Okay, look for any exit wounds.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.077
Okay. I'm-I'm not
finding anything.

04:12.121 --> 04:15.080
Well, bullets travel through
the body, could exit anywhere.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.866
Yeah. Wait, here.
Here, there's one.

04:17.909 --> 04:20.477
Now what?Put pressure on it.
We got to stop the bleeding.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.045
Oh, my God.
It's-it's not stopping.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.482
Then you're not putting enough
pressure on it, Sebastian.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.572
Okay.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.704
Yeah, yeah. I think...
I think it's working.

04:29.747 --> 04:32.315
Dwayne, can you hear me

04:32.359 --> 04:34.317
How is he?He's nonresponsive.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.885
Barely got a pulse. We need
to get him to the ambulance now.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.234
PATTON:
All right, come on, people!

04:38.278 --> 04:39.496
Make a lane!

04:39.540 --> 04:41.803
BP's dropping.
We need to stabilize.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.239
Could be bleeding internally.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.327
Hang in there, Pride.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.155
Turn him around.Let's turn the gurney.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.504
Turn him, turn him.Turn it.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.376
All right,
let's get him up.Got it.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.212
Hi there.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.781
What's happening?

05:03.825 --> 05:05.217
You're the detective.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.349
Think you can figure it out.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.051
Where is everyone?Don't worry about them.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.271
This is sort of
a you-and-me thing.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.406
It's confusing, I know, but...

05:19.449 --> 05:21.756
all you have to do
is take my hand.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.369
Everything will become clear.

♪

06:01.448 --> 06:02.666
GREGORIO:
Amelia got away?

06:02.710 --> 06:04.233
Nearly killed a civilian
when she took his car.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.453
Every law enforcement agency
in the state is gunning for her.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.368
Roadblocks everywhere.Talking about a
woman who escaped

06:08.411 --> 06:10.370
Parish jail hospital
to come after Pride.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.893
She can evade a manhunt.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.199
Yeah, but when I returned fire,
she was hit.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.636
One of the bullets
caught her stomach.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.420
That'll slow her down.Yeah. Judging
by the blood,

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
she needs medical attention.

06:18.769 --> 06:19.901
Gives us a window of opportunity

06:19.944 --> 06:21.598
to track her before she flees.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.121
Yeah, hope you found
some evidence

06:23.165 --> 06:25.428
to do just that,
Sebastian.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.212
Sebastian.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.780
This is the part where you
fill us in on what you found.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.608
I've been to a lot
of crime scenes.

06:31.652 --> 06:35.569
This much blood, usually
the victim doesn't make it.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.048
"Usually" doesn't count here.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.528
What if he dies?Not an option.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.225
Look at the amount
of blood that...Listen, Sebastian.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.619
Dwayne Pride is stronger
than a couple of bullets.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.447
He'll pull through,
and we'll take Amelia down.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.799
'Cause you're gonna
work this scene

06:48.843 --> 06:51.106
and find us
the evidence we need.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.546
All right, I-I think I saw
some smudges on the floor

06:56.590 --> 06:57.634
where Amelia might
have been hiding.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.680
I'll take samples.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.169
You really think
Pride's gonna pull through?

07:12.301 --> 07:14.303
Absolutely.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.525
GSW to the chest.
He's lost a lot of blood.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.048
He's having difficulty
breathing.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.266
NURSE:
Sats are dropping.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.529
WADE:
He has a hemothorax.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.878
He's gonna need a chest tube.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.488
We need to get him
to the O.R. now.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.750
Let's move.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.796
You, wait here.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.890
THE ANGEL:
Oh, Dwayne.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.283
When a nine-millimeter bullet
is fired at close range,

07:38.327 --> 07:40.851
it enters the human body
at maximum velocity,

07:40.895 --> 07:43.854
puncturing
tissue and bone,

07:43.898 --> 07:46.857
wreaking havoc
on vital organs.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.859
You have three of those in you.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.383
Not looking good.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.559
Doctors are gonna do their part.

07:52.602 --> 07:53.777
Of course
they will.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.736
And you'll do yours.I'm a fighter.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.651
Everyone knows it.I'll hold on.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.566
But at what cost?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.743
Both lungs collapsed,

08:02.786 --> 08:06.181
heart nicked,
you're bleeding internally.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.965
So much trauma.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.793
You're thinking
I should give up?

08:09.837 --> 08:12.448
Not give up.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.712
Let go.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.979
So that's what this is.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.329
You've come
to convince me to die.

08:24.373 --> 08:28.856
Oh, Dwayne.
You got me all wrong.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.641
I didn't come here.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.469
You summoned me.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
What's that supposed to mean?

08:35.558 --> 08:41.085
Every time you put yourself
in danger, which is a lot,

08:41.129 --> 08:43.087
I've been there.

08:43.131 --> 08:48.658
Keeping my distance,
letting you take the lead.

08:48.702 --> 08:54.534
I've watched you pull yourself
from the brink over and over.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.057
I brought you here?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.800
I think you're crushing on me.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.152
Maybe we should both
take the hint?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.942
NURSE: His heart rate's
starting to drop,

09:11.986 --> 09:13.640
and it's dropping fast.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.250
SURGEON: Keep working
and try to slow it down.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.599
I don't want him
bottoming out on us.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.688
We're gonna need
to operate now.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
NURSE:
What's his heart rate at?

09:20.385 --> 09:21.822
Do we have time
to stabilize him?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
Heart rate's bottomed out.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.000
Vitals are dropping.
We're losing him.Let's open him up.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.349
See what we're dealing with.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.438
Pulse ox
is at seven and dropping.

No, I can't tell you about
Special Agent Pride's condition.

09:37.664 --> 09:38.969
Because I can't, all right?

09:39.013 --> 09:40.492
I-I can't!

09:40.536 --> 09:41.755
You got to leave
this phone line open.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.278
God. Another reporter.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.801
Like a dog with a bone.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.629
Need to maintain
a media blackout.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.762
Yeah, well, that's pretty easy.
I mean, we don't know anything.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.285
How long could the
guy be in surgery?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.244
NCIS.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.029
No comment.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.161
I talked to Laurel.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.163
Some sort of computer outage
at the New York airports.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.817
Everything's grounded.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.166
It'll be fine.
Laurel will get a flight,

10:02.210 --> 10:03.777
Pride will get out of surgery,

10:03.820 --> 10:05.300
and we need to
keep positive.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.519
Well, we also need
to be realistic.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.782
There's a chance
we could lose him.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.087
PATTON:
Until we hear from Doc Wade,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.263
we can either wallow in doubt
or stay on task.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.004
We're staying on task.

10:14.048 --> 10:17.529
Can't do anything to help Pride
except track Amelia down.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.314
What do we know

10:19.357 --> 10:20.620
Whoa, whoa.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.925
One at a time.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.668
Gregorio?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
Law enforcement's monitoring

10:27.452 --> 10:29.193
every hospital
and clinic in the area.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.455
No sign of her yet.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.544
Okay, I reviewed every security

10:32.588 --> 10:36.679
and traffic cam within the
ten-mile radius of her escape.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.681
She ditched her car
outside city limits.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.988
All right, my turn?
I analyzed the smudges, uh,

10:41.031 --> 10:42.859
that we found
in Pride's kitchen.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.819
Boat resin, common brand,
with traces

10:45.862 --> 10:47.081
of clay minerals
and sediment consistent

10:47.124 --> 10:48.691
with Mississippi River water.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.040
That doesn't narrow
our search much.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.868
GREGORIO:
No, but FBI brought in

10:51.912 --> 10:53.304
their detection dog unit,
used a sample

10:53.348 --> 10:55.698
of Amelia's blood to try
to track her movements

10:55.742 --> 10:57.308
where she ditched the car.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.875
They can focus
closer to the river.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.878
Yeah, or canals
or dozens of tributaries.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.750
It's not good enough.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.362
NCIS.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.930
Another reporter.Dang it.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.105
No, we have
no comment.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.715
Listen, take a beat.
All right?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.238
You got a lot
on your plate.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.936
I had her, Gregorio.

11:15.979 --> 11:19.635
I mean, she was right in my
hands, and I let her slip away.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.158
If I was
a split second faster...

11:21.202 --> 11:22.943
But you got to put
that out of your mind,

11:22.986 --> 11:24.945
because you're our boss right
now, and we need you thinking

11:24.988 --> 11:27.382
three steps ahead,
not looking behind.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.864
HQ. They need me in SCIF.

11:30.907 --> 11:31.821
Well, get to it, boss.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.174
GIBBS:
Christopher.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.654
Gibbs.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.657
How's he doing Not good.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.747
Yep. I know both sides of that.
His and yours.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.009
You stay strong.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.837
I'm trying to.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.404
Director Vance doing all right?

11:49.447 --> 11:51.885
Yeah, he's on the mend.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.061
Your suspect, Amelia Parsons.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.932
The best we can tell,

11:55.976 --> 11:58.369
she was tying up loose ends
for her former employer.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.241
Probably fleeing now.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.809
It's not about loose ends.You got a lead?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.855
Yeah, we sent you a classified
file on your shooter.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.944
We've already been read in
on Amelia's file.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.817
No, you haven't.
Not on this one.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.035
She's CIA?

12:12.079 --> 12:14.777
She contracted for them.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.301
Off the books, wet work.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.607
Part of a hit team.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.349
Yeah, with someone
you might recognize.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.526
Her husband, John Stone.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.573
Mr. Stone and Pride tangled

12:28.617 --> 12:29.792
about a year ago.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.881
He went over the side of a roof.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.928
Means this wasn't
about business.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.799
Means she's making it
about revenge.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.888
Helps a lot.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.411
Thanks, Gibbs.GIBBS: Christopher?

12:40.455 --> 12:43.414
We know what Dwayne
means to you.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.286
All of us.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.722
You take it personal.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.985
Know what you're going to say.

12:49.029 --> 12:52.554
Keep my feelings out of it
and work the case.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.948
No. Just the opposite.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.385
You use those feelings.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.604
You make it personal.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.911
You do what you have to do
to get Amelia.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.285
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

14:20.076 --> 14:22.122
Haven't left his side
all night?

14:22.165 --> 14:24.428
Oh, only to change clothes.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.736
If the roles were reversed,
he'd have done the same.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.958
I'm glad you're here, Rita.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.264
Nothing would have stopped me.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.965
Uh, how was the surgery?

14:39.008 --> 14:42.055
They removed almost two bullets
from the chest,

14:42.098 --> 14:45.058
but there's a fragment lodged
near the ventricle artery.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.973
His heart.

14:47.016 --> 14:51.020
A specialist is needed to
even attempt to remove it.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.805
Someone in town?Houston.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.372
Fact of the matter

14:55.416 --> 14:58.593
is he probably couldn't
survive the flight.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.380
What are his chances
of stabilizing?

15:04.425 --> 15:06.166
Slim.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.126
Well, I hope that's not
your version of sugarcoating.

15:15.175 --> 15:18.265
If it were any other patient,

15:18.308 --> 15:21.007
he wouldn't have survived
the night.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.010
But you know Dwayne.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.535
Always the overachiever.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.973
Well, there's some good news.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.323
Our team has a lead
on the suspect.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.124
If this was an excuse
to get me to come down here,

15:51.167 --> 15:52.995
I didn't need the grand gesture.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.128
All you had to do was call.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.962
Oh, babe, what a mess.

Clear.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.947
Place is empty.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.123
She's definitely been here,

Hey.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.520
You guys will want to see this.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.697
Boat's missing.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.351
She's on the river.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.048
No way to know which direction.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.137
2,000 square miles of
waterways she could be using.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.052
There aren't enough cops
in the state of Louisiana

16:50.096 --> 16:51.227
that could track her now.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.055
Might not be able to find her,

16:53.099 --> 16:54.883
but we may be able
to draw her back.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.406
You heard Sebastian.
She's gone.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.147
Well, as far as
Amelia's concerned,

16:58.191 --> 16:59.583
Pride killed her husband.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.324
She broke out of prison
and risked everything

17:01.368 --> 17:02.891
to return the favor.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.154
Retribution's more important
to her than her own safety.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.069
Yeah, she thinks she succeeded.

17:07.113 --> 17:10.594
What happens if she knew
he was still alive?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.814
What are you thinking?

17:12.857 --> 17:16.078
What would Pride do?

17:16.122 --> 17:19.168
REPORTER: And now an update
on a developing story.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.040
Law enforcement officials
have broken the media blackout

17:21.083 --> 17:23.172
on the federal agent
who was gunned down last night

17:23.216 --> 17:24.826
in his New Orleans apartment.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.088
According to the chief
of surgery

17:26.132 --> 17:27.350
at Saint Mary's Hospital,

17:27.394 --> 17:29.178
the wounded agent
is in good condition

17:29.222 --> 17:30.484
and will be medevaced to Houston

17:30.527 --> 17:32.181
for specialized surgery
this afternoon.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.227
The victim is a well

17:34.270 --> 17:35.489
...pillar of the community
known for

17:35.532 --> 17:38.231
his law enforcement experience
with NCIS.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
Thankfully,
Special Agent Dwayne Pride

17:40.233 --> 17:42.104
is expected
to make a full recovery.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.846
And now onto the weather.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.108
WEATHERMAN:
This week's going to be

17:46.152 --> 17:48.023
a hot and humid one.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.199
[broadcast continues
indistinctly]

17:57.206 --> 17:59.252
Actually, on second thought,

17:59.295 --> 18:02.124
there is something that I need.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.097
REPORTER: According to
Saint Mary's Hospital,

18:18.140 --> 18:19.794
the wounded agent
is in good condition

18:19.837 --> 18:21.361
and will be medevaced to Houston
for specialized...

18:21.404 --> 18:23.232
This news report is crazy.
You might as well

18:23.276 --> 18:25.147
have told the world
what room Pride's staying in.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.323
Breaking the media blackout
is our only chance

18:27.367 --> 18:28.585
of drawing Amelia back.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.500
Using our boss as bait?

18:30.544 --> 18:32.154
That's the whole point.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.591
She's gonna want to try
to finish the job.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.810
What if she succeeds?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.464
Well, that's why
we set up a decoy.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.248
Ambulance leaves the hospital
for the helipad.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.945
We're surrounded
by undercover SWAT.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
As far as Amelia's concerned,
Pride's inside.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.166
PATTON: And I'll be
monitoring traffic cams.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.602
If she comes,
we'll be ready for her.

18:45.646 --> 18:46.908
We've done it before.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.866
And you were almost shot
by a sniper that time.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.085
What are our other options?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.087
All right? Letting
Amelia slip away?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.611
She comes back in six months,
maybe a year,

18:54.655 --> 18:56.918
to find Pride again?Trust me.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.398
I do not love this plan, okay?

18:58.441 --> 18:59.964
But it's the best bad idea
that we have,

19:00.008 --> 19:01.488
and we have to focus
on taking her down.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.185
And what if the roles
were reversed?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.013
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's what Pride would do.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.058
And look where it got him.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.932
Look, I want everybody
in agreement here.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.152
If you think
we should call it off...

19:18.157 --> 19:20.376
Like Sebastian says...

19:20.420 --> 19:23.118
best bad idea.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.904
But I'm going up to that
hospital to watch over Pride.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.168
She's not getting
a second shot at him.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.524
Update?

19:37.567 --> 19:39.787
Status quo, I'm afraid.

19:42.311 --> 19:46.010
I'm a woman of action, you know?
Always have been.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.013
I see a problem, no
matter how complicated,

19:49.057 --> 19:51.146
and I work it
until I find a solution.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.105
But this, it...

19:54.149 --> 19:56.020
The waiting game.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.022
Maybe he needs motivation

19:58.066 --> 20:00.199
to keep fighting,
to push through.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.202
Maybe... maybe he needs
his daughter.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.420
She's still in New York,

20:04.464 --> 20:06.292
and there's no flights
in or out.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.250
Another waiting game.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.993
Dwayne's fate is not going to be
decided by a computer glitch.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.864
I'm gonna make some calls.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.910
Yeah.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.139
Every time you take a risk,

20:28.183 --> 20:30.272
this was exactly what I was
afraid would happen.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.102
And now that it has...

20:36.191 --> 20:38.106
...I'm at a loss for words.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.415
I'm sure that surprises you.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.297
I know...

20:55.341 --> 20:59.127
you're holding on
right now,

20:59.170 --> 21:02.217
and I desperately
want you to fight.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.875
But, Dwayne,
if you can't...

21:16.492 --> 21:20.148
:
If you can't fight anymore...

21:22.411 --> 21:25.284
...it's okay.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.286
It is.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.257
We'll be all right here.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.311
THE ANGEL:
She's right, you know?

21:54.225 --> 21:57.141
They'll all be fine without you.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.362
But I... I still have...

22:00.406 --> 22:02.973
Dwayne Pride.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.714
Literally on death's doorstep,

22:04.758 --> 22:07.804
and you're still thinking
about work.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.850
You see how messed up
that is, right?

22:11.417 --> 22:14.289
It's more than
just work for me.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.160
You're a crusader.

22:16.204 --> 22:19.033
Always on the lookout
for another

22:19.076 --> 22:23.254
killer to catch, victim
to help, justice to serve.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.734
Exactly.

22:24.778 --> 22:28.172
You're not the only one
who can serve it.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.610
Billions of people
live out their lives every day

22:30.653 --> 22:32.394
without the benefit of you.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.135
I'm not claiming
to be special.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.572
But you are, Dwayne.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.531
You have sacrificed

22:38.574 --> 22:40.794
for the greater good

22:40.837 --> 22:44.275
time and time and time again.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.800
What more do you have to prove?

22:46.843 --> 22:50.194
There's more to it
than just... work.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.500
Your daughter.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.849
Laurel will be fine without you.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.155
She's used to not
having you around.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.157
You don't know what
you're talking about.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.507
Let's not fight.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.814
I'm really not here
to make you feel bad.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.477
You're not here at all,
and neither am I.

23:12.608 --> 23:14.175
Yeah, we can go
round and round

23:14.218 --> 23:16.090
on a metaphysical debate
all day long,

23:16.133 --> 23:17.657
but we don't have
that luxury.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.398
You're a figment
of my imagination

23:19.441 --> 23:21.312
presenting evidence I've
considered dozens of times.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.531
Yes.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.707
Middle-of-the-night stuff,
keeping you awake.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.101
Making you question
every move you've ever made.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.320
Were you present
and accounted for?

23:29.364 --> 23:31.497
Were you fair to your team?

23:31.540 --> 23:34.108
Your daughter?

23:34.151 --> 23:35.805
Always did what I
thought was best.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.199
Absolutely.

23:38.242 --> 23:41.332
You know what's right.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.813
Have the courage
of your conviction.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.339
Do the right thing.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.872
Yeah.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.091
Not convinced.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.267
:
Not convinced.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.008
Is Pride talking?

24:05.052 --> 24:07.228
Yes, but not to me.

24:07.271 --> 24:10.100
Well, that's got
to be a sign.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.146
It's been happening
since he's been here.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.453
Whoever it is seems
to be riling him up.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.019
GREGORIO:
Well, that's good.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.326
Means he's sticking with us,
don't you think?

24:18.369 --> 24:20.676
I think we all have
different ways

24:20.720 --> 24:23.113
of coping with the
possibility of death.

24:23.157 --> 24:26.334
Dwayne's arguing,
Rita's keeping busy,

24:26.377 --> 24:28.467
and you're staying positive.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.469
Trying, Loretta.

24:31.992 --> 24:35.343
Lasalle's coping method
is channeling Pride.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.954
He's got a Hail Mary plan
to draw Amelia out.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.655
Dangerous, audacious, with
a limited margin for error?

24:42.698 --> 24:45.092
Yep.
Uh-huh.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.963
Dwayne would approve.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.228
LASALLE:
All right, we're headed out on

24:51.272 --> 24:53.230
the Crescent City Connection.
Getting off now.

24:53.274 --> 24:56.407
Heliport's three miles away.
If Amelia takes the bait,

24:56.451 --> 24:58.192
it'll be anywhere
along this route.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.323
PATTON:
Monitoring every camera

24:59.367 --> 25:00.977
within a three-mile radius.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.414
Got your six. Eyes peeled.
This girl is tricky.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.374
LASALLE: We got eight cops armed
to the teeth backing us up,

25:06.417 --> 25:07.941
so, uh, we're good.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.334
Yeah. I-I did the math,
and, uh, if we succeed,

25:10.378 --> 25:12.032
we'll be facing
a professional assassin

25:12.075 --> 25:13.599
who's eluded every
cop in the state,

25:13.642 --> 25:15.557
and whose sole purpose
is to kill us.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.255
Fingers crossed. We play
this right, we'll...

25:24.218 --> 25:25.872
You hurt

25:25.915 --> 25:26.873
No.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.271
Driver, let me see your hands!

25:34.315 --> 25:36.012
Get 'em up!
Do it!

25:39.276 --> 25:40.843
:
I'm sorry.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.497
She made me!

25:43.716 --> 25:45.500
She

25:45.544 --> 25:46.762
No. It's okay.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.285
All right, it's okay.
It'll be all right.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.504
This is a diversion.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.203
How does Amelia know it worked?

25:56.424 --> 25:57.991
She's watching us.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.949
We got to get back
to the hospital.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.342
Fellas.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.650
Female patient
with GSW to the abdomen.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.913
Facial lacerations,
possible broken ribs.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.089
Vitals stable?
Yes.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.482
Good. Clean her up.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.833
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

26:17.924 --> 26:21.362
Okay, dear, we
are going to take

26:21.405 --> 26:23.320
care...

26:23.364 --> 26:25.018
Shh.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.377
PILOT:
Air Four is breaking cover
to proceed to Saint Mary's.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.426
Amelia figured out
we set a trap for her.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.341
She sent her own decoy.
We're securing the building now.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.517
What

26:46.561 --> 26:48.389
MAN:
Everybody down! Take cover!

26:48.432 --> 26:49.782
I'd say she is already.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.653
WADE: Go now!GREGORIO: All right,
stay with Pride.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.437
Keep him safe.
I'll deal with Amelia.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.744
Just in case.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.050
What am I supposed
to do with this?

26:57.093 --> 26:58.617
Point and shoot.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.748
Close this.

26:59.792 --> 27:00.880
MAN:
We've lost power!

27:35.958 --> 27:38.178
[woman gasps,
whimpers]

27:57.153 --> 27:59.416
Aah! Careful, Rita.
We can't jostle him.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.592
Kind of hard
if we're supposed to hide him.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.769
Shouldn't be moved at all.Where should we take him?

28:03.812 --> 28:05.466
Ah, this will do.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.815
The morgue?

28:06.859 --> 28:09.426
Well, the only other folks
in here are dead.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.341
No more targets for Amelia.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.039
Except us.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.221
All right.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.268
How's he doing?

28:25.312 --> 28:26.835
Not good.
Pulse is failing.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.103
Oh, he's bleeding again.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.671
Damn it.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.205
I know you're in there.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.253
Give me Pride,
and I'll let you live.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.689
I'm not sure how this works.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.386
I've got this.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.269
Geez, he's crashing.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.661
Can you help him?

29:10.705 --> 29:14.100
No, we've got to get
him upstairs soon.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.537
Wait!

29:16.580 --> 29:18.713
You really are stubborn,
aren't you?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.628
This needs to end.Yes. People you love

29:20.671 --> 29:22.848
are about to die, and you have
the power to make that stop.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.806
There's got to
be another way.But there's not.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.852
There's got to be.
Honestly,

29:26.895 --> 29:29.985
why is this even
a question, Dwayne?

29:30.029 --> 29:32.814
Just take my hand now.

29:49.483 --> 29:50.440
LASALLE:
Amelia!

29:55.141 --> 29:56.838
Check the others.
Yeah.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.797
I'm not letting her
get away again.All right.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's me, it's Sebastian.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.325
Is everyone all right?

30:05.368 --> 30:08.241
No. Dwayne just flatlined.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.734
We need help! Now!

30:23.778 --> 30:25.562
What's happening?He's crashing.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.129
Amelia?

30:27.173 --> 30:28.957
Lasalle and Sebastian
are after her.

30:50.109 --> 30:51.632
Stay where you are.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.461
:
Not a lot of options.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.726
Pride...

30:58.769 --> 31:00.206
he's dead, right?

31:00.249 --> 31:03.252
You will be
if you don't stop moving.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.341
I know how you feel.

31:05.385 --> 31:08.736
It hurts, doesn't it?

31:08.779 --> 31:11.957
The man you kidnapped
at the diner, where is he?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.698
Trunk of a Honda, block away.

31:14.742 --> 31:15.743
Don't move.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.139
Do something about it.

31:25.318 --> 31:28.799
Yeah, that works for me.

Hey, listen.
This isn't right, okay?

31:43.597 --> 31:45.251
You hear me?

31:45.294 --> 31:47.383
It's not right.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.039
Hey, this isn't the way.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.348
Yeah.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.394
I know.

Her weapon's secured. Cuff her.

No backseat flying, Dwayne.
