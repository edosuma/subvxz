03:57.237 --> 04:00.275
John Paul? It's me.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.820
<i>Sweetie, I didn't
know you were coming over.</i>

04:05.945 --> 04:08.448
Well, I thought I'd make
dinner for us tonight.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.821
Oh.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.520
Did your mom
throw away anything?

04:12.652 --> 04:15.656
Uh, no.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.563
Wait, did you say dinner?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.226
Yeah.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.635
Because you cooked dinner
for us 2 nights ago,

04:21.761 --> 04:23.832
and you know, I was just
gonna order a pizza.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.374
I know, my lasagna
was a disaster,

04:25.498 --> 04:26.841
but I'm redeeming myself.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.378
By the time we're married
next month and I move in here,

04:29.502 --> 04:30.947
I'll have perfected ten meals.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.308
And tonight, I'm cooking
a perfect turkey.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.645
Oh, the perfect turkey.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.054
But what about
the perfect pizza,

04:36.309 --> 04:38.289
made perfectly for you,
delivered right to your door'?

04:38.411 --> 04:40.322
John Paul, you cannot
eat out this much.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.891
And that's why you have me!

04:42.015 --> 04:44.359
Come on, I insist.

04:56.696 --> 04:57.936
. HEY-. HEY-

04:58.064 --> 04:59.839
What's in the box?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.468
I don't know.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.309
Still going through
Mom's old stuff.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.348
You know,
I'm thankful for the house,

05:06.472 --> 05:10.887
but a lot of this stuff
just screams yard sale.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.617
But this box said "Keep" on it,
so I figured I'd check it out.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.727
<i>Anything else out in the car?</i>

05:16.849 --> 05:18.294
No, no, no.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.455
Go through the box.
I'm gonna cook dinner.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.792
Oh.

05:21.921 --> 05:25.960
Hey, you know what's
really good is asparagus pizza.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.003
No pizza.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.534
No. Stop.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.039
Out. No pizza.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.570
<i>God.!</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:01.368
So what's inside?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.700
Look at this.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.968
What is it?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.442
It's my dad's military stuff.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.773
Dog tags.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.972
<i>There's</i> a <i>letter.</i>

06:11.104 --> 06:13.345
Look at this photo.
This is my dad.

06:13.473 --> 06:18.388
Oh, so handsome.

06:18.511 --> 06:22.653
You know, my mom never talked
about him before she died.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.989
I always wondered
what really happened, though.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.894
That must have been
painful for her.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.897
Yeah.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.433
Look at them. They're so young.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.561
They had their whole lives
in front of 'em.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.696
<i>And then he's gone.</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:43.035
You know, I have no idea
how my dad died.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.706
I don't really know
much about him.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.382
Who's Eddie Adams?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.924
I have no idea.

06:55.047 --> 06:57.084
Well, why don't you
try to contact him?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.761
Maybe he can
fill in some blanks.

06:59.886 --> 07:03.527
You know I don't like
talking to strangers.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.567
You're supposed
to like strangers.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.602
You're a postman.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.934
Yeah, but I don't like dogs.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.816
Hi, I'm looking for
an Edward J. Adams, please.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.148
Edward James Adams.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.854
Oh, wrong number, sorry.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.514
Hi, my name
is John Paul George.

07:27.647 --> 07:31.789
I'm looking for an Ed...

07:31.918 --> 07:33.864
Yeah, I can call back.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.488
No problem.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.058
Hi, I'm looking for
an Eddie Adams please.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.104
Oh, I'm sorry, my condolences.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.729
I'm sorry.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.289
Yeah, hello, I'm looking for
an Edward Adams.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.479
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry-

07:48.501 --> 07:49.707
Next.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.975
I'm looking for
an Edward J. Adams, please.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.141
Uh, okay.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.153
Edward Jeffrey Adams?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.185
Well, I don't know him.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.618
He would've known my father.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.056
Really?

08:05.685 --> 08:07.756
Is this Edward?

08:07.887 --> 08:09.867
How old are you?

08:09.989 --> 08:12.196
Twelve.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.936
Have a good day.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.242
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:19.565 --> 08:21.772
What happened?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.616
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

08:26.739 --> 08:27.945
I know. I'm sorry, John.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.578
I didn't know it
would burn that easily.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.917
What?

08:33.044 --> 08:36.025
No, I mean trying to find
this Edward Adams guy.

08:36.148 --> 08:37.855
I'm striking out at every turn.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.123
Dinner is perfect.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.631
Perfect?

08:43.756 --> 08:46.168
Honey, nobody can
order a pizza like you.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.568
Stop it.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.640
How many names do you
have left on that list?

08:50.763 --> 08:53.209
One, and I'm expecting
to hit a brick wall,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.739
but let's give it a shot.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.146
Hello? Anyone there?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.916
<i>State your business.</i>

09:07.046 --> 09:08.957
My name is John Paul George.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.560
<i>Like the Beatles?</i>

09:10.683 --> 09:11.889
Yeah, like the Beatles.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.224
<i>The Beatles broke up.</i>

09:14.887 --> 09:16.093
What?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.667
What did he say?

09:17.790 --> 09:18.996
"The Beatles broke up."

09:19.125 --> 09:20.627
Here, let me try.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.764
Hi, we're looking for
a Mr. Edward Adams.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.103
He's a friend of my-

09:26.232 --> 09:28.610
<i>Friend?
Wrong number, Miss Manners.</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:31.078
Are you always this rude?

09:32.171 --> 09:35.015
Do you know a Steven George
that was in Vietnam?

09:35.141 --> 09:37.712
<i>That's a name I
haven't heard in a longtime.</i>

09:37.843 --> 09:39.049
<i>Who's asking?</i>

09:39.178 --> 09:40.623
Steven George's son.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.555
<i>Good-bye.</i>

09:44.951 --> 09:46.726
That man knew my father.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.878
He says 25,000 troops
will be withdrawn by September.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.179
I mean, do you believe
a word that guy <i>says?</i>

10:12.111 --> 10:13.749
<i>Hey preacher boy.</i>

10:13.879 --> 10:17.224
<i>What are we, at church?</i>

10:17.350 --> 10:19.660
Always with that Bible.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.924
Just finding
some comfort in a place

10:22.054 --> 10:24.625
that's not really comfortable.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.737
What are you, scared out here?

10:26.859 --> 10:30.329
Yeah, I'm scared.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.769
<i>And you know what?
This makes me feel better.</i>

10:33.899 --> 10:35.742
Here, read this.

10:38.671 --> 10:41.117
4:13, it's underlined.

10:44.076 --> 10:48.650
All fight, listen up, boys.

10:48.781 --> 10:53.821
<i>"I can do all things through
Christ which strengthens me.</i>"

10:53.953 --> 10:55.159
<i>Amen, amen.</i>

10:55.287 --> 10:56.994
Hey, what are you,
a preacher boy?

11:03.729 --> 11:05.640
You're going to Mississippi?

11:05.765 --> 11:09.645
Just for a couple of nights.
Just for the weekend.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.716
Tomorrow, 10 am,
meeting with 2 photographers.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.045
At 1, we finalize the catering,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.745
and at 6,
we meet with the minister.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.221
How am I supposed to
explain that?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.223
Is it cold in Mississippi?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.850
John Paul.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.860
Fine.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.708
But I am painting this room
while you're gone.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.673
Okay.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.248
Ugh.

11:51.744 --> 11:58.354
<i>♪ Yeah, it's late in the night
and I look in the mirror ♪</i>

11:58.484 --> 12:04.162

12:44.029 --> 12:46.908
<i>What did I say'?</i>

12:47.032 --> 12:48.841
<i>My name is John Paul George.</i>

12:48.968 --> 12:50.174
I'm from California.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.283
We spoke on the phone
the other day?

12:53.405 --> 12:55.180
<i>Never heard of you.</i>

12:55.307 --> 12:57.344
We spoke 2 days ago.

12:57.476 --> 13:00.423
<i>Go away.</i>

13:00.546 --> 13:02.457
No!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.392
Now, you don't-look,
you don't have to shoot at me.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.829
<i>I'm sorry. What?</i>

13:08.954 --> 13:11.525
I think you know something
about my father.

13:11.857 --> 13:16.931
<i>I don't know
anything about your daddy.</i>

13:17.062 --> 13:20.134
Look, I'm gonna sit here
and wait until we talk.

13:20.266 --> 13:24.146
<i>You can sit there
10 years for ab' I care.</i>

13:24.270 --> 13:26.807
I'll just sit here and wait.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.240
<i>Come on m. Suppers on.</i>

14:07.379 --> 14:12.954
I'm Wayne, Eddie Adams' son.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.998
John Paul.

14:16.121 --> 14:19.159
I know who you are.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.531
Can I use your bathroom?

14:25.531 --> 14:26.942
Hey, where are you?

14:27.066 --> 14:29.842
Well, I found the guy.
Only, it's his son, Wayne,

14:29.969 --> 14:34.315
and it looks like they lived
in this same old house forever.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.147
<i>Oh great! So, you?!
Be home tomorrow?</i>

14:36.275 --> 14:38.881
<i>Cause! Really want you
to meet the videographer.</i>

14:39.011 --> 14:40.285
Ooh, I like. What are these?

14:40.412 --> 14:41.618
Mom, you like?

14:41.947 --> 14:43.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.562
Honey, I'll be home,
but I don't-

14:44.617 --> 14:46.028
<i>What? I can't hear you.</i>

14:46.151 --> 14:49.325
Look, I can't talk now. I just-

14:49.455 --> 14:51.492
John Paul, can you
call me in an hour or something

14:51.624 --> 14:53.035
when you get better reception?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.195
<i>I'll have some flowers for you
to pick from then anyway.</i>

14:55.327 --> 14:56.601
<i>Okay? 1 love you.</i>

14:56.929 --> 15:00.376
Love you too.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.010
Looks good.

15:07.139 --> 15:10.120
Killed it myself.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.315
Do you mind if I say grace?

15:22.154 --> 15:24.634
Father, we thank you
for this food

15:24.957 --> 15:26.664
and we ask that you
strengthen us with it.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.632
And would you
bless our time together

15:29.962 --> 15:32.033
as we learn more
about our fathers.

15:32.164 --> 15:34.940
In Jesus' name, amen.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.379
Listen, we sort of got off
on a bad foot out there.

15:41.507 --> 15:45.580
And I wanted to tell you why
I called you and came out here

15:45.711 --> 15:47.918
was to see your dad
about my dad,

15:48.047 --> 15:52.996
because my dad said that he
and your dad were best friends.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.927
Whose dad?

15:55.054 --> 15:58.501
Your dad and my dad.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.969
Well, you're a funny guy,
Ringo.

16:02.094 --> 16:06.008
Why did you make me
wait out there all day?

16:06.131 --> 16:10.079
See how serious you were
about talking.

16:10.202 --> 16:15.174
And me flying out here
didn't prove anything to you?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.581
Flying's easy.

16:16.709 --> 16:22.057
Sitting in the hot
Mississippi sun ain't.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.956
Wait here.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.570
I'm going to bed.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.200
I gotta get up early.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.539
Wait a minute.

16:42.668 --> 16:47.447
I came out here
to talk about our fathers.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.144
We'll talk in the morning.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.033
Sounds like someone
made contact.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.634
How far away?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.236
Don't know.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.702
A few clicks.
I wouldn't worry about it.

17:13.232 --> 17:17.612
When we go out tonight,
should I keep my eyes on you,

17:17.736 --> 17:19.238
the jungle, or the ground?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.180
You know, in case trip wires.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.444
All three, Stevie.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.020
Should I ever look back

17:25.144 --> 17:27.282
or should I just
keep looking forward?

17:30.649 --> 17:32.754
Okay.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.129
What are you doing?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.760
What are you doing?
You're packing too much stuff.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.232
Just take absolutely
what's necessary.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.467
Remember to
keep yourself hydrated.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.739
Ready?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.450
As I'll ever be.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.114
<i>Hey, everything okay?
That last phone call was kinda-</i>

18:01.246 --> 18:04.284
Oh yeah, no, it's fine.
It's different.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.363
But you know, I think
I'm gonna stay the night, so-

18:07.486 --> 18:09.523
<i>Oh, so you
must be getting along web'.</i>

18:09.655 --> 18:13.364
Well, actually, you know,
he's kinda creepy and weird.

18:13.492 --> 18:16.666
Like, haunted house type of-

18:18.263 --> 18:20.436
You want some coffee?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.477
It helps me sleep.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.654
Um honey,
Wayne's making coffee.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.417
I'll call you in the morning.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.404
<i>Get the roof!</i>

18:51.530 --> 18:52.736
What are you doing?!

18:52.865 --> 18:54.367
I'm sawing off the roof!

18:54.500 --> 18:55.706
I see that!

18:55.834 --> 18:57.438
Why?!

18:57.569 --> 19:00.573
You can't go on a road trip
without a convertible, Ringo.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.583
What road trip?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.312
No need to be yelling.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.445
You'll wake my neighbors.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.124
What road trip?

19:10.249 --> 19:11.728
Don't drop the roof.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.136
Get your bag.
I'm already packed.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.501
Don't worry about locking up.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.233
I'm not so worried
about locking up

19:25.364 --> 19:27.742
as I am about
why you're sawing-

19:27.866 --> 19:31.245
I'm not reading my
daddy's letters in that house.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.317
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.679
What letters?

19:35.807 --> 19:41.883
<i>Letters about Vietnam
which talk about your daddy.</i>

19:42.214 --> 19:43.659
Can I see 'em?

19:43.782 --> 19:46.695
They're $500 a piece.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.764
What are you talking about?

19:48.887 --> 19:50.798
You wanna read 'em,
they're $500 a piece.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.403
Now we're going to The Wall.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.902
What wall?

19:55.227 --> 19:56.433
Vietnam Wall.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.802
- In D.C.?
- That's the one.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.342
No, no, no, no, no.
Lam not going to The Wall.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.378
<i>I'm getting married in 3 weeks.
I'm not going to The Wall.</i>

20:03.502 --> 20:05.345
Well, congratulations.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.480
All right,
gentlemen, listen up.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.953
Last night at 2300,

20:13.278 --> 20:17.283
one of our 047s went down
behind enemy lines.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.396
There were no survivors.

20:19.518 --> 20:24.194
We got picked for the mission to
go in and retrieve the bodies.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.529
<i>They're located
within</i> a <i>square mile</i>

20:25.657 --> 20:28.695
<i>somewhere in the Mekong Delta.</i>

20:28.827 --> 20:30.465
<i>It's not reachable by air,</i>

20:30.596 --> 20:33.770
<i>so we're gonna have to
hump it all the way in.</i>

20:33.899 --> 20:37.369
The hump alone is 72 hours,

20:37.502 --> 20:40.642
<i>so stay alert and do what! Say.</i>

20:40.772 --> 20:42.217
And we will go in there

20:42.341 --> 20:44.287
and find our boys
before the enemy

20:44.409 --> 20:47.982
and bring them home.

20:48.313 --> 20:49.792
Any questions?

20:49.915 --> 20:51.417
No, Sarge.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.526
Adams, George, take us out.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.362
Saddle up. Lock and load, boys.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.242
<i>I can't believe you're
making me pay to read these letters.</i>

21:15.440 --> 21:17.784
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.547
I'll let you read one.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.318
<i>You like it, we move on.</i>

21:22.447 --> 21:24.620
Deal stands.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.600
"Eleanor,
I can't begin to tell you

21:36.728 --> 21:39.641
"how much I miss you and Wayne.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.712
<i>"It's only been</i> a <i>few weeks,
but it feels like an eternity.</i>

21:42.834 --> 21:44.609
<i>"I can't wait to get home.</i>

21:44.736 --> 21:46.374
<i>"1 met a guy from California.</i>

21:46.505 --> 21:48.746
"His name is Steven George.

21:48.874 --> 21:51.286
"He's kind of religious.

21:51.410 --> 21:57.326
He's gonna be a preacher or
something but he's a good guy."

21:57.449 --> 21:59.656
My dad was gonna be a preacher.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.628
I didn't know that.

22:01.753 --> 22:07.465
That's why they're worth
500 bucks a piece.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.664
"His wife back home
just had a little boy.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.606
"That's all he talks about.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.643
"He's naming the boy
after the Beatles.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.610
"It makes me think of Wayne.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.376
<i>I miss you. Eddie. ".</i>

22:23.809 --> 22:26.585
Deal.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.364
<i>Why do we have to
go to The We“?</i>

22:35.487 --> 22:36.864
Why can't we just
read the letters here?

22:36.988 --> 22:39.025
I don't need to see
my father's name on a wall

22:39.358 --> 22:41.031
to find the answers
I'm looking for.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.634
'Cause the answers
you're looking for

22:42.761 --> 22:44.502
and the answers
I'm looking for are in D.C.,

22:44.629 --> 22:46.666
but they're not
names on a wall.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.029
Steven! We've gotta fall back!

23:18.530 --> 23:20.567
Steven!

23:22.033 --> 23:23.569
We gotta fall back!

23:23.702 --> 23:25.943
I've got you covered. Go!

23:36.014 --> 23:37.516
Honey, it's
a 2- or 3-day drive.

23:37.649 --> 23:38.970
I'll fly out of D.C.
or something.

23:39.050 --> 23:42.054
I've already called work.

23:42.187 --> 23:45.862
No, honey, of course I haven't
forgotten about the wedding.

23:45.991 --> 23:50.906
<i>You know, this is just
something I need to do.</i>

23:51.029 --> 23:52.508
I don't care about the flowers.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.111
You pick the flowers.

23:57.502 --> 23:58.708
White lilacs are fine.

23:58.837 --> 24:02.614
They're fine because
they're not traditional.

24:02.741 --> 24:06.416
Yes, yes, you are very
traditional, honey, so in that-

24:06.545 --> 24:08.491
Hi, Cynthia?

24:08.613 --> 24:10.889
<i>This is Wayne Adams.
How you doing?</i>

24:11.016 --> 24:14.054
I understand how all this
must seem inopportune,

24:14.186 --> 24:17.633
but I want you to know that
I asked John to accompany me

24:17.756 --> 24:21.499
to the Vietnam Wall
for closure.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.129
It's been psychologically
taxing on us over the years,

24:24.463 --> 24:26.943
which is difficult
for anyone to comprehend.

24:27.065 --> 24:30.069
But let me tell you,
you are all he goes on about.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.775
He just went to the restroom, so
he's gonna call you fightback.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.046
That's how you talk to 'em.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.154
You tell 'em
what they wanna hear.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.546
It's 34 bucks.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.228
She's gonna think
I didn't wanna talk to her.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.829
Sounds to me like she
was doing all the talking.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.232
That's how she is, Wayne.
She likes to talk.

24:53.558 --> 24:56.038
She likes to control you.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.640
Wow.

24:57.762 --> 25:00.208
I'm traveling
with a psychologist.

25:05.704 --> 25:06.910
The 365's coming up.

25:07.038 --> 25:08.244
We need to take the next exit

25:08.573 --> 25:10.109
so we can go straight up
through the state.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.983
This is it.
You gotta get off fight here.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.521
What are you-get off!
Take the exit!

25:13.645 --> 25:15.647
Get off! What are you doing?

25:15.780 --> 25:17.657
What are you doing?

25:17.782 --> 25:21.730
Still can't drive
through 'bama.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.890
Wayne...

25:24.022 --> 25:25.228
Wayne, this is ridiculous.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.595
It's gonna take us
6 extra hours to get there.

25:28.727 --> 25:29.933
You in a hurry?

25:30.061 --> 25:31.802
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I kinda am, you see,</i>

25:31.930 --> 25:33.450
because I gotta
get back to California.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.569
I got a wedding to plan.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.270
You're not planning a wedding.

25:37.602 --> 25:38.808
Excuse me?

25:38.937 --> 25:40.177
Your girlfriend
is planning the wedding.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.252
You're just nodding your
head yes to everything she says

25:43.575 --> 25:45.213
'cause you can't say no.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.750
<i>You're afraid of her.</i>

25:46.878 --> 25:48.084
Really?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.749
And you've come
to that conclusion

25:49.881 --> 25:52.259
after knowing me for 12 hours,
having never met her,

25:52.584 --> 25:55.622
and hearing one side
of one phone conversation?

25:55.754 --> 25:57.631
It's impressive, isn't it?

25:57.756 --> 25:59.565
Why can't you drive
through Alabama?

25:59.691 --> 26:02.069
Oh no, no, no.
Don't change the subject on me.

26:02.193 --> 26:03.604
Oh, no, no.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.008
Tell me
you're not afraid of her.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.269
I'm not afraid of her.

26:06.598 --> 26:09.807
It's just easier to let her have
her way than to argue about it.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.141
What's wrong with that?

26:11.269 --> 26:13.112
That's gonna be
that way your whole life.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.945
She's always gonna
tell you what to do.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.950
No it's not.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.248
And she doesn't
tell me what to do.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.990
I just choose
to serve her needs.

26:22.113 --> 26:25.686
By being here fight now?

26:25.817 --> 26:27.023
If I were you, I would-

26:27.152 --> 26:28.563
<i>Okay web',
you know what, Wayne?</i>

26:28.687 --> 26:29.927
You're not me. You're not me.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.261
And I would smack her!

26:31.590 --> 26:32.796
I don't need-

26:32.924 --> 26:34.130
I don't need relationship advice
from someone-

26:34.259 --> 26:36.500
Smack her! I don't need
relationship advice from someone-

26:37.295 --> 26:38.706
Smack her!

26:38.830 --> 26:40.138
Some backwoods hillbilly

26:40.265 --> 26:42.711
whose never probably
even been in a relationship.

26:42.834 --> 26:46.281
That's what I don't need.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.885
You don't know
anything about me.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.179
You're right, Wayne, I don't.

26:49.307 --> 26:52.220
Why can't you drive
through Alabama?

26:52.344 --> 26:53.880
Don't worry about it.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.685
Not worried, just curious.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.988
Why can't you drive
through Alabama, Wayne?

26:59.117 --> 27:01.859
Told you I'm not gonna talk
about it, so quit asking me.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.967
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

27:04.089 --> 27:05.932
Don't worry about it.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.297
Why can't you drive
through Alabama, Wayne?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.832
Hey!

27:08.960 --> 27:11.338
I told you to stop asking me!

27:11.663 --> 27:14.974
Get that through your thick
little skull and quit asking me!

27:15.100 --> 27:17.140
You're like a little Woodpecker,
just pecking at me!

27:17.268 --> 27:20.044
Pecking! Pecking!

27:23.274 --> 27:26.050
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

27:32.217 --> 27:35.096
You okay?

27:35.220 --> 27:35.720
Yeah.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.763
You know,
I got your back, Stevie.

27:43.895 --> 27:46.068
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

27:50.101 --> 27:53.344
You okay?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.312
I just wanna make
things right in my life.

27:55.407 --> 28:01.722
I messed up a lot.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.348
You know, I got a son too.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.888
Yeah?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.222
Yeah.

28:06.351 --> 28:11.858
I just wanna get home.

28:11.990 --> 28:18.874
With this mission,
I don't know.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.773
I know.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.109
I wrote my just-in-case letter
before we left.

28:25.236 --> 28:27.842
I had one of
those feelings too.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.344
You're more than welcome
to read my Bible.

28:32.477 --> 28:36.118
It might make you feel better.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.328
Not right now.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.829
<i>We move in 1 hour.</i>

28:42.787 --> 28:44.198
<i>Hey, George.</i>

28:44.322 --> 28:45.824
You ever consider
the possibility

28:45.957 --> 28:47.800
that Private Adams over there

28:47.926 --> 28:49.803
is beyond the powers
of redemption?

28:49.928 --> 28:52.909
Thank you, Sarge.

28:53.031 --> 28:56.740
I don't think that's something
to be joking about, sir.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.280
Now why's that, soldier?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.408
Because that's a serious matter
between Eddie and God.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.022
You having some kind of a
funny feeling over there, Eddie?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.282
No, Sarge.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.822
<i>You sure?</i>

29:07.946 --> 29:09.152
Yes, Sarge.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.260
George and I were
just talking about stuff.

29:11.382 --> 29:14.090
On your feet, George.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.168
You wouldn't be
preparing my men for death,

29:21.292 --> 29:22.498
now would you, soldier'?

29:22.827 --> 29:24.033
No, Sarge. Absolutely not.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.073
'Cause I've been hearing you
talk to them about God,

29:26.197 --> 29:27.403
and the Bible, and all that,

29:27.532 --> 29:29.205
and you realize
that's not your job.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.143
Yes, Sarge.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.475
As you were.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.340
<i>Sarge;.</i>

29:34.472 --> 29:35.974
Just came in.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.985
All right,
we got the location now.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.523
Two clicks north from the fork
on the Giang River.

29:42.847 --> 29:44.053
Adams.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.822
Thank you.
That's right here, Sarge.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.328
<i>All right, let' s go.
Take 'em out.</i>

29:48.453 --> 29:49.864
All fight.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.400
<i>All fight, guys, grab your gear.</i>

30:11.309 --> 30:15.382
You're not a Jesus freak,
are you?

30:15.513 --> 30:17.220
What do you mean?

30:17.348 --> 30:20.090
A freaky Bible guy.

30:20.218 --> 30:25.167
Quoting Scriptures all daylong,
trying to convert people.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.533
So, do you believe in God?

30:34.866 --> 30:36.277
I knew it.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.971
<i>Knew what?</i>

30:38.102 --> 30:40.048
I'm not gonna do this with you.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.377
Do what?

30:41.506 --> 30:42.917
Play these games.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.247
<i>What games?</i>

30:44.375 --> 30:49.017
These beat-around-the-bush games
asking me questions about God,

30:49.147 --> 30:51.525
so you can eventually
Bible bash me to death,

30:51.850 --> 30:53.955
<i>and tell me
I'm a terrible person,</i>

30:54.085 --> 30:55.428
and I'm going to hell,

30:55.553 --> 30:57.931
all so you can feel like
you done your saintly duty

30:58.056 --> 31:00.195
by destroying one of
Satan's minions,

31:00.325 --> 31:04.899
all so you can secure yourself
a nice little place in heaven.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.475
Did you memorize that?

31:26.117 --> 31:28.927
Look honey, it's gonna
take a little bit longer

31:29.053 --> 31:30.623
<i>'cause we can't
drive through Alabama.</i>

31:30.955 --> 31:33.026
Why can't you drive
through Alabama?

31:33.157 --> 31:34.500
I don't know.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.299
I'll be home Tuesday
at the latest.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.930
John Paul,
this is not acceptable.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.474
Hi, Cynthia!

31:40.598 --> 31:42.942
I gotta go before
he breaks his leash.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.341
What have you gotten into?

31:44.469 --> 31:45.880
<i>I can't talk now; Honey.</i>

31:46.004 --> 31:48.382
Seriously, I need to go,
but I'll call you later.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.985
I love you. Bye.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.214
I love you, bye!

31:56.347 --> 31:57.553
Forty-two bucks.

31:57.682 --> 32:00.925
She was thirsty.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.032
So, you got this one.

32:03.154 --> 32:05.156
Uh, what do you mean?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.896
Well, chronologically,
I got the last tank,

32:08.026 --> 32:09.666
so that would mean
that you have this one.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.173
Chronologically.

32:11.296 --> 32:15.438
Chronologically,
you're about to owe me $500.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.542
Heh, heh, little girls.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.013
What are you looking at?

32:28.146 --> 32:31.992
Big dumb hillbilly
with very little hygiene.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.562
That looks like
that feminine ride of yours

32:34.686 --> 32:37.257
ain't got no hygiene.

32:41.192 --> 32:44.002
Hey Jethro,
this ain't no trash can.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.665
You wanna take that out?

32:46.998 --> 32:49.103
Why don't you make me?

32:51.469 --> 32:53.278
Okay.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.344
<i>Evening, sir.</i>

32:55.473 --> 32:57.680
<i>Could I interest you in</i>
a <i>couple of bags of beef jerky?</i>

32:58.009 --> 33:00.182
Hey, this stuff is so good,
you'll punch your mama.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.517
That's okay.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.319
What about some iced tea
for the road?

33:07.218 --> 33:08.424
Three dollars change.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.294
You sure you don't
wanna buy any of this?

33:10.421 --> 33:13.334
Uh-oh, somebody just
got punched in the face.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.960
Uh-oh.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.046
Yeah hey, it's me
down at the gas station.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.380
Look, hey, send me
three or four deputies.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.420
I got a brawl going again.

33:39.484 --> 33:43.398
Hey look, you might wanna roll
the ambulance with them, okay,

33:43.521 --> 33:46.331
'cause these boys are serious
and somebody's gonna get hurt.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.435
Ooh! I mean, he's putting
a whooping on this boy

33:55.566 --> 33:57.011
like you ain't seen lately.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.247
Uh-oh, you're not
gonna believe this.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.322
Okay, the yuppie
just took down Goliath, okay,

34:07.445 --> 34:09.721
with an oil can to the head.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.425
Ringo, we gotta go!

34:11.549 --> 34:14.621
Cops are coming!

34:17.188 --> 34:19.668
Why were we
fighting those guys?

34:19.791 --> 34:21.600
'Cause they was
rude to me, man.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.330
Nobody talks to me like that.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.065
Nobody!

34:28.299 --> 34:29.801
Oh, What? What?!

34:30.134 --> 34:31.373
You got a problem
with that now?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.380
Yeah, I do.

34:33.504 --> 34:34.710
I just- I can't believe-

34:34.839 --> 34:38.116
That's just the way things
are around here, city boy.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.518
You owe me a letter.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.062
A letter?

34:48.186 --> 34:50.166
All right.

34:59.630 --> 35:03.203
You know, I can't.

35:03.334 --> 35:08.340
I can't... I feel like
you're taking advantage of me.

35:08.473 --> 35:12.114
Advantage?

35:12.243 --> 35:14.689
You show up at my house

35:14.812 --> 35:17.691
and you think
I'm taking advantage of you?

35:17.815 --> 35:19.226
<i>I'm trying to help you!</i>

35:19.350 --> 35:20.590
I just helped you.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.129
<i>That's right, you did.</i>

35:22.253 --> 35:25.325
You found some courage in
that weak little body of yours

35:25.456 --> 35:26.662
and you went all in.

35:26.791 --> 35:30.466
Okay, I went all in
to try to stop it.

35:30.595 --> 35:32.734
Exactly.
You went all in, Ringo.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.208
I'm proud of you.

35:38.202 --> 35:39.408
I'm sorry, okay.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.414
I didn't mean to get you
into the whole thing.

35:41.539 --> 35:45.510
I just-you know,
I didn't expect-

35:45.643 --> 35:48.522
Me?

35:48.646 --> 35:50.489
Yeah.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.755
Boys, it took y'all long enough
to get here.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.525
Hey look, y'all,

35:57.655 --> 36:00.158
one bunch of 'em went
towards the interstate, right?

36:00.291 --> 36:01.497
The other bunch, hey,

36:01.626 --> 36:03.367
they went toward
the old highway over here.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.134
A big country redneck
and then a yuppie.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.175
Big redneck driving
a pickup truck, okay.

36:08.299 --> 36:09.505
He's bigger than you are.

36:09.634 --> 36:10.840
And then a yuppie.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.409
He was driving some little rig.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.709
I don't know what it was.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.875
Oh, did he ever put a whooping
on that big redneck.

36:16.207 --> 36:18.414
One of 'em went that way,
one of 'em went that way.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.284
May even be a tooth or two
out there.

36:20.411 --> 36:21.617
I don't know.

36:21.746 --> 36:24.158
Look, you boys need to get
you some of this beef jerky.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.727
But when they first
pulled up, okay, look,

36:25.850 --> 36:27.261
they went to war
with each other.

36:27.385 --> 36:28.591
I don't know who's who.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.392
It took y'all
too long to get here.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.195
Look, but you don't wanna
try to punch my mama, okay,

36:33.324 --> 36:34.530
'cause she's like homely.

36:34.659 --> 36:35.865
She don't play that.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.400
You know,
you'll be swallowing teeth.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.802
That's all I know.

36:38.930 --> 36:42.707
They left when they heard
y'all pulling up with sirens.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.609
But hey,
that's my report on the fight.

36:45.736 --> 36:47.716
Y'all boys
want some beef jerky?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.787
What's going on?

37:00.918 --> 37:02.329
<i>What do you got, Adams?</i>

37:02.453 --> 37:04.399
Path just ended, Sarge.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.370
Henderson?

37:08.492 --> 37:10.768
<i>Right here, sir.</i>

37:13.564 --> 37:16.807
Big Dragon, this is Little Elf.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.914
Big Dragon, be advised,

37:19.237 --> 37:21.683
Little Elf has followed
designated route

37:21.806 --> 37:23.285
<i>to grid coordinates.</i>

37:23.407 --> 37:25.819
Route ends, please advise.

37:30.781 --> 37:31.987
Big Dragon, be advised.

37:32.316 --> 37:33.556
Little Elf has rechecked map

37:33.684 --> 37:35.357
and grid coordinates
are correct.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.659
How current is your information?

37:41.859 --> 37:44.271
Could you recommend an alt-

39:13.351 --> 39:14.557
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?!

39:14.685 --> 39:16.028
Oh, now I'm crazy now too, huh?

39:16.354 --> 39:17.560
I don't know, Wayne.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.009
They seemed to be
doing just fine.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.434
What's your problem?

39:20.558 --> 39:21.764
I don't know.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.098
Maybe it's just a Ted Bundy

39:23.427 --> 39:24.804
death-by-mutilation
son of thing.

39:24.929 --> 39:26.567
Well, just wave
your holy book at them.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.472
Oh, okay.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.675
- Where you headed?
- New York City, mate.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.008
DC. If you want it.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.981
Fair dinkum, we want it.
Thanks, mate.

39:46.617 --> 39:48.062
This car's gorgeous.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.592
What year is this bird anyway?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.427
.55-

39:51.555 --> 39:52.761
What's your name?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.870
Ted.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.630
His name is Ted.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.708
Is that a funny name, mate?

39:59.830 --> 40:01.571
Hey, pipe down, Cowboy Ted.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.804
How 'bout you?

40:03.934 --> 40:05.811
Oh, I'm Annie.

40:08.773 --> 40:09.979
Look at that.

40:10.107 --> 40:11.848
I'm John Paul George,
and this is...

40:11.976 --> 40:13.580
Ringo?

40:15.045 --> 40:17.082
Ted, it's not nice
to make fun of someone's name.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.655
He's sensitive.

40:18.783 --> 40:19.989
Sorry mate.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.619
No, that's okay.

40:24.488 --> 40:25.694
I'll go check on the rooms.

40:25.823 --> 40:27.131
I'll go with you.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.527
Stay put.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.110
Are you guys brothers?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.640
No.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.714
We're just friends.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.784
He treats you like
a kid brother, you know.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.685
So, Why are you guys
going to D.C.'?

40:51.816 --> 40:54.126
It's a long story.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.988
It's a long ride.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.531
That it is.

40:57.655 --> 40:58.861
<i>Wham you going?</i>

40:58.989 --> 41:01.162
Making sure I get my own room.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.802
Tell him
I'm gonna sleep outside.

41:05.763 --> 41:08.505
Does he really think
he's a cowboy?

41:08.632 --> 41:11.806
Yes.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.643
How long you known him?

41:13.771 --> 41:17.048
One long month on the road.

41:17.174 --> 41:18.585
<i>We're cousins, you know,</i>

41:18.709 --> 41:23.055
sol think he feels this
obligation to look after me.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.989
I've known Wayne 2 days.

41:25.115 --> 41:26.651
Really?

41:26.784 --> 41:28.559
We're driving to D.C.

41:28.686 --> 41:32.065
to see our fathers' names
on the Vietnam Wall.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.499
Wow.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.201
<i>How many rooms, male?</i>

41:43.567 --> 41:45.240
Scoot over, Annie.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.674
We're under the stars tonight.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.011
Really?

41:49.139 --> 41:50.550
<i>Yep.</i>

41:50.674 --> 41:51.880
They didn't have any rooms?

41:52.009 --> 41:53.249
Some stupid boy scout jamboree,

41:53.544 --> 41:54.784
all booked up for the night.

41:54.912 --> 41:58.587
Ugh, where are we gonna sleep?

42:03.687 --> 42:06.065
Well, so at least
it's not raining, no?

42:07.625 --> 42:08.831
I think I have scoliosis.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.165
There's a rock lodged

42:10.294 --> 42:12.001
between my third
and fourth vertebrae.

42:12.129 --> 42:13.938
Isn't this backwards?

42:14.064 --> 42:15.824
Shouldn't the boy scouts
be sleeping outside,

42:15.900 --> 42:18.107
working on their
camping merit badges,

42:18.235 --> 42:20.875
or weaving a basket,
or something?

42:21.005 --> 42:24.782
Yeah, is there some, like,
ultra-comfortable, super dry,

42:24.909 --> 42:27.048
hotel room merit badge
that I'm missing?

42:27.177 --> 42:29.623
Look, everybody/just stop
your complaining, okay'?

42:29.747 --> 42:31.556
It's good for you
to sleep outside.

42:31.682 --> 42:34.253
It gets you closer to nature.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.724
I like it out here, Wayne.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.663
And I like you.

42:40.257 --> 42:46.139
<i>So, tell Us more about why
you guys are going to The Wall.</i>

42:46.263 --> 42:49.870
This guy shows up
on my doorstep.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.037
Here we are.

42:53.871 --> 42:55.782
John Paul told me
about the letters.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.614
Can I read one?

43:01.579 --> 43:02.819
You ever gonna read that thing?

43:02.913 --> 43:05.325
You paid for it.
You might as well read it.

43:05.649 --> 43:07.060
Paid for it?

43:07.184 --> 43:09.061
Long story.

43:21.899 --> 43:23.344
"Dear Eleanor."

43:23.667 --> 43:25.772
Who's that?

43:25.903 --> 43:27.883
That's my mama.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.814
Where's she?

43:29.940 --> 43:31.248
Dead.

43:33.911 --> 43:38.587
Pretty name.

43:38.716 --> 43:41.219
<i>“Dear Eleanor and Wayne,</i>

43:41.352 --> 43:43.923
"it's been raining here
for 12 days straight."

43:44.054 --> 43:46.159
Not much to say, I guess.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.237
Just wondering
how you all are doing.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.772
<i>I've been looking at things</i>
a <i>little differently</i>

43:51.895 --> 43:54.034
thanks to this guy,
Steven George.

43:54.164 --> 43:56.110
<i>He's a good man.</i>

43:56.233 --> 43:59.271
He doesn't judge me
and I can open up to him.

43:59.403 --> 44:01.883
He's small.
He's not a great soldier,

44:02.006 --> 44:06.113
but he's bigger
than any man out here.

44:06.243 --> 44:07.984
I've written eight times.

44:08.112 --> 44:10.092
I haven't heard from you.

44:10.214 --> 44:13.024
I'd like to know how
Wayne's doing in preschool.

44:13.150 --> 44:15.926
Okay, I love you.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.691
Eddie.

44:38.242 --> 44:39.949
Ugh.

44:40.077 --> 44:41.920
Hey.

44:42.046 --> 44:43.923
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

44:50.154 --> 44:51.724
You hungry? I'm starving.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.732
Starving.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.131
Annie needs coffee.

44:55.259 --> 44:56.738
<i>That's good.</i>

44:56.860 --> 44:59.067
Who's got the coffee?
Need the coffee.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.675
Why don't I wake him up

45:00.798 --> 45:03.244
and then the four of us
will go get something.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.812
Yeah, sure, mate.

45:04.935 --> 45:06.141
Okay, cool.

45:06.270 --> 45:07.772
Cool.

45:12.309 --> 45:14.016
Wake up.

45:14.144 --> 45:15.452
Wake up.

45:18.782 --> 45:22.286
Maybe I'll just let them do it.

45:22.419 --> 45:25.093
You know,
maybe we oughta just wait.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.828
He's a little-

45:27.958 --> 45:29.403
Well, mate,
I'm not waiting anymore.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.968
I saw a store about
a mile back last night.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.007
Come on Annie, let's go.

45:34.131 --> 45:35.337
I can wait.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.969
<i>Look, you guys, it's just not-</i>

45:38.102 --> 45:41.208
All right, look,
I'm sorry, okay'?

45:41.338 --> 45:42.749
I just get all cranked out

45:42.873 --> 45:44.250
when I don't get good sleep,
all fight?

45:44.374 --> 45:46.786
So, how about the three of us
go get some coffee

45:46.910 --> 45:48.116
and some breakfast stuff
with the car,

45:48.245 --> 45:49.986
come back and get Wayne
when he gets up?

45:50.114 --> 45:51.320
How 'bout that?

45:51.448 --> 45:52.950
Yeah.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.426
I don't know, you guys.

45:54.752 --> 45:57.358
Well, then Annie
and I'll go get it.

45:57.488 --> 45:58.899
I don't know.

45:59.022 --> 46:00.228
No, it'll be fine, mate.

46:00.357 --> 46:02.462
We'll just take the car.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.431
Yeah, we'll be fight back.

46:04.762 --> 46:05.968
<i>With coffee.</i>

46:06.096 --> 46:08.508
<i>She's a beauty.
Not a scratch, mate.</i>

46:11.135 --> 46:12.512
It's not that big of a deal.

46:12.836 --> 46:15.783
I can just try to
wake him up one more time.

46:28.519 --> 46:30.897
Oh boy.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.515
Ringo, where's my car?

46:57.815 --> 47:02.093
Tell me you didn't
let them take my car.

47:02.219 --> 47:07.464
They said they'd be fight back.

47:07.591 --> 47:09.798
How could you
let him take my car?

47:09.927 --> 47:11.201
They said they'd be fight back.

47:11.328 --> 47:14.400
No, you moron!
They stole my car!

47:15.199 --> 47:17.406
Don't call me names.

47:17.534 --> 47:19.878
Moron!

47:20.003 --> 47:21.209
Stop calling me that.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.544
Moron!

47:22.873 --> 47:24.250
If you call me moron
one more time-

47:24.374 --> 47:26.251
Oh, what? What are you
gonna do about it, huh?

48:23.567 --> 48:25.046
Wait here.

48:25.168 --> 48:26.943
Oh, tell me
you're not considering

48:27.070 --> 48:30.483
the services of this car.

48:30.607 --> 48:32.917
I'll take care of it.

48:47.324 --> 48:49.099
Nice move, Grace.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.950
Oh, why hello.

49:05.075 --> 49:07.214
What's your name?

49:13.951 --> 49:17.990
Um, look, we-
that car that's out there,

49:18.121 --> 49:20.226
<i>the one with the "for safe"
sign, I wanna buy it.</i>

49:20.357 --> 49:23.668
Twelve hundred dollars firm,
cash only.

49:28.365 --> 49:31.073
I have $600.

49:35.272 --> 49:37.115
Excellent handling.

49:40.344 --> 49:42.221
Little girl?

49:44.181 --> 49:46.354
We'll take it.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.554
He's got the money.

49:50.420 --> 49:52.195
You have $600?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.632
Well, you handled that
really well, didn't you.

49:54.758 --> 49:56.635
And I'm out $600.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.331
No you're not.
You're only out $100.

49:59.463 --> 50:00.703
And you know what, Wayne?

50:01.031 --> 50:02.738
I really don't care,

50:03.066 --> 50:05.603
because I did the deal
and the deal's done.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.979
So, you could show
a little more gratitude.

50:09.106 --> 50:10.551
Hey Ringo, guess what?

50:10.674 --> 50:12.585
I'm not showing any gratitude,

50:12.709 --> 50:16.714
'cause I'm driving
a 1984 VW Rabbit

50:17.047 --> 50:21.359
when I should be driving
my 1965 Ford Thunderbird!

50:38.135 --> 50:39.443
What are you doing?

50:39.569 --> 50:41.378
Let's see what
this little baby can do.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.007
Slow down!

50:50.047 --> 50:51.788
I was wrong about this car.

50:55.819 --> 50:57.799
<i>Truck! Truck!
Truck! Truck! The truck!</i>

51:00.824 --> 51:03.327
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

51:03.460 --> 51:04.768
Whoo!

51:11.635 --> 51:15.344
No, no, no, no, no!

51:18.542 --> 51:20.715
Stop the car, Wayne!

51:34.758 --> 51:38.570
Look, I have
a suspended license,

51:38.695 --> 51:43.166
a few warrants, and no ID.

51:43.300 --> 51:49.512
My name is Edward Brisko.

51:50.407 --> 51:51.613
You got it?

51:51.741 --> 51:53.652
<i>Drivel; Slowly
step out of the vehicle.</i>

51:53.777 --> 51:55.415
Place your hands on the hood.

51:55.545 --> 51:58.651
Passenger,
put your hands on the dash.

51:58.782 --> 52:02.320
Okay officer,
but this isn't my oar.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.332
Don't move.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.371
Okay.

52:12.496 --> 52:13.702
This your car?

52:13.830 --> 52:15.241
Yes sir.

52:15.365 --> 52:16.605
Step out of the vehicle,
please.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.237
Driver's license, registration,
proof of insurance.

52:25.342 --> 52:28.482
You see, we were
just test driving it

52:28.612 --> 52:30.216
'cause we just
bought it, you know.

52:30.347 --> 52:32.628
<i>No, we weren't test driving it
because we did just buy it.</i>

52:32.682 --> 52:34.252
And I don't have insurance

52:34.384 --> 52:35.829
<i>'cause I'm from
California, officer.</i>

52:36.153 --> 52:38.463
John Paul George?

52:38.588 --> 52:39.794
Yes.

52:39.923 --> 52:41.402
Three first names?

52:41.525 --> 52:44.267
That's what I said, too, sir.

52:44.394 --> 52:46.772
Where's yours?

52:46.897 --> 52:48.376
Well, I don't have mine on me.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.375
See, I was just driving
the car up the hill

52:50.500 --> 52:52.605
'cause he can't drive a stick.

52:52.736 --> 52:54.147
That makes two of you.

52:54.271 --> 52:55.477
What's your name?

52:55.605 --> 52:58.643
Mine?

52:58.775 --> 53:01.915
Eddie Brisko.

53:02.245 --> 53:04.316
This your friend'?

53:04.447 --> 53:05.892
Yes sir.

53:06.216 --> 53:08.492
That his name?

53:13.490 --> 53:16.403
No, it's Wayne Adams.

53:18.395 --> 53:19.931
<i>Put your hands
on top of your head.</i>

53:20.263 --> 53:21.936
<i>Interlock your fingers.</i>

53:45.288 --> 53:47.359
You got 2 minutes.

54:03.406 --> 54:04.783
Hey Cynthia, it's me.

54:04.908 --> 54:08.879
I'm on my way home,
but I may need bail.

54:09.012 --> 54:11.219
Bail? For jail?

54:11.348 --> 54:12.554
Who are you fight now?

54:12.682 --> 54:13.990
Calm down!

54:14.317 --> 54:16.456
No, don't tell me to calm down.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.929
Okay, I can't take this.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.633
I don't know where you are
or who you're with.

54:20.757 --> 54:21.963
<i>Cynthia...</i>

54:22.292 --> 54:24.363
No, Jonathan, I am serious.

54:24.494 --> 54:25.939
If you don't come home
fight now...

54:26.263 --> 54:28.903
I can't come home
fight now, I'm in jail.

54:30.667 --> 54:32.510
Cyn...

54:37.307 --> 54:38.615
Women.

54:39.342 --> 54:41.879
This is why we need dads.

54:48.285 --> 54:49.765
So, you gonna
make a call or anything,

54:49.786 --> 54:51.066
'cause I hear
the guys in D-Block

54:51.354 --> 54:53.960
are planning an escape
at midnight.

54:56.626 --> 54:59.368
This funny to you, Ringo?

54:59.496 --> 55:03.034
Yeah, Wayne, it is.
It's one big joke.

55:11.508 --> 55:14.580
So, what'd you do?

55:14.711 --> 55:19.023
'Bama ain't the only state
I can't drive through.

55:19.349 --> 55:21.955
Why?

55:22.085 --> 55:25.589
'Cause this ain't the
first time I made this trip.

55:34.464 --> 55:38.037
Came to The Wall 16 years ago.

55:38.368 --> 55:42.043
<i>My mama wanted to see it.</i>

55:42.372 --> 55:44.545
I never made it.

55:54.384 --> 55:59.356
Got hit by a drunk driver.

55:59.489 --> 56:02.493
Crashed our car
into the bridge.

56:14.771 --> 56:19.652
Mama died.

56:19.776 --> 56:22.086
<i>So I was scared</i>

56:22.412 --> 56:26.417
and I just hid

56:26.549 --> 56:29.996
'til the ambulance came

56:34.090 --> 56:36.866
and took her away.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.839
I just ran.

56:47.971 --> 56:53.649
Like a stupid kid, I ran.

56:53.777 --> 56:57.850
I needed money to get home,

56:57.981 --> 57:03.624
so I robbed
the first gas station I saw.

57:06.856 --> 57:10.599
I didn't hurt anybody.

57:15.632 --> 57:20.638
So just relax, Ringo.

57:20.770 --> 57:23.614
You'll be out of here
in the morning.

57:58.508 --> 58:04.481
Jesus, forgive me.

58:04.614 --> 58:10.587
What am I doing?

58:10.720 --> 58:13.758
I'm so sorry.

58:22.732 --> 58:26.646
I ask this for Wayne's sake.

58:33.977 --> 58:37.186
Be a dad to him.

59:03.940 --> 59:06.011
All right, I need a perimeter.

59:09.045 --> 59:11.125
How long do you think it's
been since they were here?

59:11.214 --> 59:13.134
I don't know, hard to tell.
Probably a few hours.

59:13.249 --> 59:15.058
<i>Fire's still going.</i>

59:15.184 --> 59:17.095
What's that smell?

59:18.855 --> 59:21.563
Don't touch that, Stevie.

59:24.027 --> 59:26.064
<i>Check that tent there, Shears.</i>

59:28.798 --> 59:30.243
It's clear.

59:30.567 --> 59:31.773
Rigby?

59:31.901 --> 59:33.209
Clear.

59:35.638 --> 59:38.642
I'm afraid
it's pretty clear, Sarge.

59:46.883 --> 59:52.799
<i>What's wrong, sir?</i>

59:52.922 --> 59:55.061
I don't know.

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.783
Blood trail.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:35.233
<i>Al! Right, boys.
Take five, cover, and conceal.</i>

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.867
<i>Move.</i>

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.811
<i>Which one of
y'all is John Wayne?</i>

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.944
I'm John, that's Wayne.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.988
John Paul George?

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:51.319
Yeah, that's me.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.854
Like the Beatles.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.188
Yes.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.728
Three first names.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.058
That's what I said.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.631
<i>Hey!</i>

01:00:58.755 --> 01:00:59.961
Free to go.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:02.626
Check out at the desk
for your belongings.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:09.867
What, do you like it in here?
Let's go, scoot. Come on.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.945
Wayne Richard Adams.

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.714
<i>Free to go.</i>

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.256
Check out at the desk
for your belongings.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:30.058
Let's go, come on.
I don't got all day.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:38.864
Morning boys.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.975
Sign there.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.872
That car was reported stolen.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.104
They dumped it into
the yard 2 days ago.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.441
Sent one of the boys out
to check things out last night

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.341
and apparently that little girl
put that sign on the car

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:53.010
just before you two showed up.

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:56.919
Say that makes you a pretty
smart little twig, wouldn't you?

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:59.185
Go on, get out of here.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.807
Get down!

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.213
They let you go. You're free.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.982
They'll realize
their mistake soon enough.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.887
I'm not going back.

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:33.289
Wayne, I really think
God's protecting us.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.936
I mean, I've been praying about
it, and look what just happened.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.397
Oh, you prayed.
Oh good. Thanks, man.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.057
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.896
<i>Hm, Much money you got left?</i>

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:43.230
You want the last letter?

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.430
I don't have any money.
You have all my money.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.332
Why, you giving up?

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.213
You want the last letter?

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.907
Wayne, I don't have any money.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.813
I have just enough
for a bus ticket home

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.248
and that's it.

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.782
<i>Wayne  Ringo.</i>

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.323
Fine.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:13.025
I'll get you the money.
Let me see it.

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.295
I don't have it on me.

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:18.337
Of course. See you later.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.408
Ringo.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.106
Ringo!

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.455
<i>Little Elf to Big Dragon.</i>

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.524
<i>We are at checkpoint alpha.</i>

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.851
<i>Be advised we do not
have</i> a <i>visual on our plane.</i>

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.293
<i>Do you read me, over.</i>

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.263
Henderson,
you keep working that radio

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.962
'til we find our plane.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.437
I'm on it, Sarge.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.475
Hey.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.587
What?

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:11.289
Do you have a piece of paper?

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.325
I'll give you
a piece of my Bible.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:17.158
Why, you feel like
writing something?

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.288
Yes.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.614
Thanks.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:15.645
Say, "Dear Wayne."

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.515
"I'm in a lot of trouble."

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:29.233
"Don't be like me."

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:34.535
I'm not writing that.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:40.512
He should be so lucky.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:44.948
I don't know what to write.

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.918
Just speak from the heart.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:56.463
You know, I...

01:05:56.585 --> 01:06:01.625
I always struggled
with my belief in God.

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:10.243
<i>Lately, We been thinking
about, thinking about it.</i>

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.985
You know, there's a verse
in here and it <i>says,</i>

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:23.079
"If you seek, you will find."

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:26.557
You know what you'll find?

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.252
What?

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:31.627
Jesus.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:37.670
<i>He can heal every hurt, every
ounce of pain that you feel,</i>

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.600
<i>every wrung act
that you ever did.</i>

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:44.337
He died on the cross
just for you, Eddie.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:54.983
Why would he do that?

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.216
Why me?

01:06:57.346 --> 01:07:02.557
He loves you, selflessly.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:09.401
<i>He wants to spend
an eternity with you</i>

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:14.201
in a place where
there is no more pain,

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:19.370
no more fighting,
no separation.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:25.441
<i>He loves you
as much as you love Wayne,</i>

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.019
<i>and he died for you,</i>

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.124
just like you would die
for Wayne.

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:40.358
I don't wanna
die out here, Stevie.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:46.167
The things that
he's seen me do,

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:49.799
I don't think
he could forgive me.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.578
<i>Well that's the
beauty of our Father.</i>

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.271
<i>If you confess your sins,</i>

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:58.146
Jesus will be faithful and just
to forgive us of our sins

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:01.414
and offer us
an eternal life in heaven.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:16.634
Will you be there?

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:20.604
Yeah.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.801
<i>And so can you.</i>

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:28.843
You and me here,
it's temporary.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:34.843
But paradise with him
is eternity.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:45.331
<i>Hello,
this is Big Dragon, over.</i>

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.166
<i>Big Dragon? We
are at checkpoint alpha.</i>

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.618
<i>We are about to
proceed to target.</i>

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.578
<i>Can you read me?</i>

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:05.511
<i>I love you, John Paul George.</i>

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.848
I'm sorry that
I gave you an ultimatum.

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:09.520
Will you forgive me.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.218
Yeah.

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:17.661
I would be mad at me too.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.528
This trip, you know-

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.761
<i>Listen, you are so
much more important to me</i>

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.872
than this wedding.

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:31.234
I want you to take
as much time as you need.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.813
How did I get so lucky?

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:38.408
You know, I was just on my way-

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.383
Are you okay? Are you there?

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.763
Honey, I gotta go.
I love you. I gotta go.

01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:53.423
Stop the bus!

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:15.813
Put your hands
on the counter, old timer.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:19.654
This is my store.
It's not a company franchise.

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:21.887
Just open the drawer.

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:31.596
Wayne Adams, put the gun down
and your hands on your head.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.939
<i>Wayne!</i>

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.475
Don't move.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.277
You just keep selling me out,
huh Ringo?

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.214
<i>On your knees.</i>

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:47.446
<i>Get on your knees, now.</i>

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.887
<i>Plastic gun, huh?</i>

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.369
<i>Up, nice and slow.</i>

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:19.613
<i>Get in the car, son.</i>

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.244
What, me?

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.018
It's funny, you know.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:31.923
You even sound like your dad.

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:33.658
What'd you just say?

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.666
<i>When I heard the
call about two young men</i>

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.071
in possession
of a stolen vehicle

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:41.433
on the way to the Vietnam Wall
to visit their dead fathers,

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:46.512
I didn't think much of it,
until I heard your names.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.775
Wayne Adams
and John Paul George.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:56.020
I was your dads' sergeant
in the 25th.

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.638
Well, once I recognized
the names, sure.

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:20.508
See, your dads talked about
the two of you an awful lot,

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:24.584
the things they wanted to do
when you boys got older.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.914
It was those
kind of good thoughts

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:30.580
that helped them
survive during combat.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.887
I wanted to meet you guys,
too, one day.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.553
What do you know, here we are.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:40.030
What'd you know
about your dad, Wayne?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:44.862
I don't know. Just been
reading his letters and stuff.

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:51.000
<i>He was</i> a <i>tough man, like you.</i>

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.670
Pain in my butt, I'll tell ya.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:56.783
Picked a lot of fights,
but he won most of 'em.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.111
Yeah?

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.748
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.386
So, what happens now?

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:07.551
You know, the store.

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:08.991
Don't worry about all that.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.860
Chuck's a friend of mine.
We go to church together.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.433
I'll talk to him.
He'll do what I say.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.832
It's a good thing
that gun wasn't real

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.997
<i>or you'd be looking
at armed robbery.</i>

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:25.670
Now, your dad, John, all he did
was talk about God all the time.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.610
Made me crazy.

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:30.740
I wanted to get him
kicked off my squad.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.511
Bet you didn't know that.

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.416
No sir.

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:38.821
<i>I tell you something,
I learned a lot from him,</i>

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:43.123
things that changed my life.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:45.398
See, most men think
that their life only matters

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:48.058
while they're alive.

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.931
But some of the
greatest men I've ever known

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.799
are already gone.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:56.933
Your dads are two of 'em.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:14:00.774
I never thought
too much about God.

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.507
I wanted what I wanted
out this life

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:07.053
and pretty much
got it all on my own.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:10.783
<i>But We Earned that,
at some point,</i>

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:14.952
each and every man
figures out that there's a void

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:19.896
deep down inside their soul.

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:23.993
There's nothing in this
world that can fill it.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:29.075
About 10 years ago,
I hit that point.

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:33.943
My wife passed away

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:39.143
and that deep void came,

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:44.925
and I questioned God.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:48.585
Everything in my life
seemed like sand.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:55.100
And then the words of your dad,
John, came roaring back to me.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.795
<i>I remember him saying,
"It's the foolish man</i>

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.133
"that builds
his castle on the sand

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:05.177
and the wise man
that builds it on the rock."

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.948
I'll never forget that.

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:15.249
<i>I learned that</i> a <i>man doesn't
have to die when he dies.</i>

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:19.889
Steven George taught me that.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:25.829
See, I'd heard about Jesus,
but I didn't know him.

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.695
It wasn't until I started
to understand all that

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:34.138
that my life changed.

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:38.871
Thank God.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.743
You two come with me.
I wanna show you something.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.948
Now, this, gentlemen,
is some of the treasure

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:49.578
that I've stored up
here on earth.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:53.022
Hopefully the good Lord
will forgive me.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.855
I'm sure he will.

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:58.624
You like that?

01:15:58.754 --> 01:15:59.960
Yes sir.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.294
Good.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.193
Here, take it.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:14.114
No way.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.216
Mr. Mansfield,
I'm not sure what...

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.215
Be sure, son.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.719
Why are you two here?
What'd you set out to do?

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:27.919
We set out to go to The Wall.

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.688
A gift.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.195
Sometimes one of
the hardest things to do

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.164
is just simply accept it.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:44.277
Take it before
I change my mind.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.104
I accept it.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:52.082
<i>Mr. Mansfield,
how did my dad die?</i>

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:57.612
<i>We were on the
fast night of</i> a <i>mission.</i>

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.183
<i>We were on the
fast night of</i> a <i>mission</i>

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:03.160
<i>to recover</i> a <i>downed
American flight crew.</i>

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:06.289
<i>Beth your dads
were on point together.</i>

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.260
What's the plan here,
Sergeant Mansfield?

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:11.769
You boys stay here.
I'm gonna go in.

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:16.000
Let me go, Sarge.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.337
You sure, Adams?

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:18.872
<i>Yes, Sarge.</i>

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:20.207
Shears?

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.837
<i>Sarge?</i>

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.682
I got your back.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.286
No, you're staying
right here, Stevie.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.149
Not a chance.

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.022
<i>Boys, be careful now.</i>

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.150
<i>Yes sir, Sarge.</i>

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.923
Will you hold this
for me, Sarge?

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.192
You got it.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.199
Stay to my left.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.803
<i>Stay alert. Stay alert.</i>

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.996
Thank you, Sarge.

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.384
All right,
I'm going in there, Stevie.

01:17:57.439 --> 01:17:58.884
<i>You cover me.</i>

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:00.281
Okay, I got you.

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.911
Go!

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.800
Eddie?

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:29.238
Eddie, how's it look?

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:40.320
Oh no.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.429
<i>Get back.</i>

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:47.461
<i>Eddie, that's
attached to claymores.</i>

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:50.827
<i>I'm gonna get some bamboo
and prop that wire.</i>

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:52.870
Don't move.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:59.410
- Henderson?
- Sarge?

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.373
I'm going in.
You stay on that radio.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.312
<i>Got it, Sarge.</i>

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:15.028
All right,
I'm coming in behind you.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:15.830
Carefully.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.169
Hold still.

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.828
Here we go.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:31.972
Stevie!

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.977
<i>Adams, gel out of there now!
That's an order.</i>

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.851
Stevie, we gotta go, man.

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:43.979
You're gonna make it.
Come on, come on!

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.125
Hang on.

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.113
Stevie, get on your feet.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.118
Come on, let's go!

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.985
Stay low, I'll be back.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:31.337
Hey man, you still there?

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:34.030
Yeah.

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:37.109
You take that for me?

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:39.838
No man, I slipped.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:51.084
Hey, do you...

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:55.355
Do you think I still have time
to make that choice?

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:04.197
<i>You think Jesus won't
think I cheated on him?</i>

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:08.472
No.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:13.945
When Jesus died on the cross, a
thief asked him the same thing.

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:22.954
What did he say?

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:29.154
"On this day, you will
be with me in paradise."

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.411
Forgive me, Jesus.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.016
<i>Hi see you in paradise, Steve.</i>

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:09.903
Your fathers died bravely,
serving their country.

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:12.306
<i>When I got back to the States,
I called your mother, John.</i>

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:17.309
<i>Let her know
I had Steven's last letter.</i>

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:21.539
She asked me to hold onto it
until she was ready.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:27.143
I guess it was just
a little too emotional for her.

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:30.154
<i>Then I'd teamed she passed,</i>

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:32.656
so after awhile I thought
it'd be all right to open it up.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:38.090
That's when I learned
it wasn't written to her.

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:40.460
It was written to you.

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:17.500
Dear John Paul,

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:21.038
I may seem far away from you,

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:26.373
but I think about you
every day.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:31.678
<i>I wanted to tell you not to
be afraid of life's journey.</i>

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.611
<i>You will Have
both good times and bad,</i>

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:38.350
<i>but know that God is there
through them all.</i>

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.427
<i>He loves you more than
I ever could, John Paul,</i>

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:48.500
<i>and I Love you
with all my heart.</i>

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:52.696
<i>I'm already so proud of you.</i>

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:59.206
<i>I'm proud that God gave you
to me and your mom.</i>

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.075
<i>And know that you've got
my biggest Messing</i>

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:06.379
<i>to be who God
intends you to be.</i>

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:11.480
<i>No matter what, son,
know that I love you</i>

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:15.652
<i>and that Jesus loves you.</i>

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:18.025
<i>You can trust him
with your heart, John Paul,</i>

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:21.191
<i>just I have.</i>

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:26.465
<i>I can't wait to see you again.</i>

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:29.768
<i>Until then.</i>

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.600

"and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness."
