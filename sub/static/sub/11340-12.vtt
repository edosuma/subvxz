Aah! Aah!

Aah!

02:08.277 --> 02:14.850
♪ You know our love
was meant to be ♪

02:14.935 --> 02:20.623
♪ the kind of love

02:20.690 --> 02:23.025
Emily.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.026
Huh?

02:24.110 --> 02:27.079
I said, this is
our last session.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.847
It doesn't
have to be good-bye.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.883
My door
is always open.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.418
Thank you.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.654
But, um, I--I feel good.

02:35.705 --> 02:38.090
You know? Ready.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.291
How are your nails?

02:39.359 --> 02:41.460
3 days, no biting.

02:41.527 --> 02:42.711
Are you sleeping?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.913
I am. Uh, it's been

02:44.998 --> 02:48.300
two weeks, I think,
since the last dream.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.702
They may not have
gone away completely.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.605
Correct me if I'm wrong.

02:52.672 --> 02:57.393
You never had a chance to mourn
your own death, did you?

02:57.477 --> 03:00.479
I'm sorry, I don't
understand the question.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.436
As part of protecting
your identity, your team

03:02.461 --> 03:03.661
had to bury you.

03:04.067 --> 03:07.453
They lost someone
they loved.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.321
Maybe you did, too.

03:10.573 --> 03:11.974
Think about it.

03:12.042 --> 03:14.994
I will.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.241
So Houston P.D. needs
our boots on the ground

03:17.266 --> 03:19.017
for the Piano Man case.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.399
Serial rapist?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.067
A case we consulted on
about 8 months ago.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.669
12 victims over 5 years.

03:23.736 --> 03:26.088
He crosses racial
and social lines, ages, too.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.406
Power assertive?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.907
Knocks them out
with a date rape drug

03:28.958 --> 03:30.092
and binds them
with piano wire.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.478
They wake up with no memory
of the assault

03:32.545 --> 03:34.980
or how they got the permanent
scar the wire leaves.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.266
So he's branding his victims.
How does he dose them?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.301
Houston P.D. still isn't sure,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.687
'cause, you know, date rape
drugs metabolize quickly,

03:41.754 --> 03:43.689
and he's keeping them
for 12 hours.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.441
So why are they
calling us in now?

03:45.525 --> 03:46.608
Because of these
most recent attacks.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.260
This piece of work has
elevated sick and twisted

03:48.311 --> 03:50.262
to a whole new dimension.
Cases in point--

03:50.313 --> 03:52.815
Brittany Anderson
filed a report after she woke up

03:52.899 --> 03:54.616
outside the restaurant
she was abducted from,

03:54.701 --> 03:57.853
and Vanessa Campbell
was just reported missing.

03:57.921 --> 04:00.456
Wait, those were victims
2 and 5, weren't they?

04:00.523 --> 04:04.009
Yes. He's going back and
attacking survivors a second time.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.128
Vanessa was grabbed
from her house?

04:06.212 --> 04:08.297
He's changing him M.O.
from what we studied.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.498
He's upping his game.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.216
Well, we know
he stalks them.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.584
But public venue abduction,
he has the power.

04:12.635 --> 04:14.753
Home invasion,
he's on their turf.

04:14.804 --> 04:16.387
So he's betting
he can gain control

04:16.456 --> 04:17.890
before they get to
a phone or a gun.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.391
They question is why.
What is he getting

04:19.459 --> 04:21.894
from revisiting old victims?

04:21.961 --> 04:24.513
It seems careless for someone
who's been so controlled up to now.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.732
What is this on the floor?

04:26.799 --> 04:28.917
Uh, that--oh, God--
that is

04:28.985 --> 04:31.103
the contents of
Vanessa Campbell's stomach,

04:31.154 --> 04:33.021
which she ralphed up.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.740
And in the glass?

04:34.807 --> 04:36.408
According to
the police report,

04:36.476 --> 04:37.993
it is salt and water.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.495
Homemade emetic.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.746
E-what what?

04:40.813 --> 04:43.599
Quick and dirty cocktail,
meant to induce vomiting.

04:43.666 --> 04:46.335
Vanessa Campbell and her
husband moved to a new address.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.087
They've put locks
on the doors.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.255
They took precautions.
She even knew what to do

04:50.323 --> 04:52.958
if she was dosed again,
and it still wasn't enough.

04:53.009 --> 04:54.710
That's what
he gets out of it.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.180
Their fear. He wants them to know
that no matter what,

04:58.264 --> 04:59.932
he can still get to them.

Alfred Adler.

05:49.588 --> 05:50.521
Hey.

05:50.606 --> 05:51.572
Hey.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.658
I'm sorry. I thought
you said 10:30.

05:53.742 --> 05:55.576
I did. For you.
Have a seat.

05:57.613 --> 05:59.447
I received Dr. Merill's
evaluation.

05:59.498 --> 06:01.532
I just wanted
to review it with you.

06:01.617 --> 06:03.084
Here?

06:03.152 --> 06:04.285
I get tired
of being profiled

06:04.353 --> 06:05.586
through my office window.

06:05.654 --> 06:07.755
Well, what is there
to discuss?

06:07.822 --> 06:09.373
She gave me
a clean bill of health.

06:09.458 --> 06:13.845
"Patient shows no hesitation
tackling difficult goals

06:13.929 --> 06:16.597
"as part of reintegrating
into her life.

06:16.665 --> 06:18.449
She has reached out
to her mother."

06:18.517 --> 06:20.251
I'm going to.

06:20.319 --> 06:21.361
And has started
a romantic relationship

06:21.386 --> 06:22.723
with a man named Sergio.

06:24.022 --> 06:25.306
Mm-hmm.

06:25.357 --> 06:27.475
Now, I don't care if
you lie to your therapist.

06:27.526 --> 06:30.044
All I care about is how your
behavior affects your job.

06:30.112 --> 06:32.530
I don't think it has.

06:32.614 --> 06:34.949
You've been
overcompensating.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.652
How have I...

06:37.719 --> 06:40.021
You rushed to repair your
relationship with Morgan.

06:40.088 --> 06:43.057
You've become an emotional
sounding board for Reid and Rossi.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.243
That's being a good friend.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.061
You offered me
parenting advice.

06:47.129 --> 06:51.165
Ok, so maybe I have been
working a little bit harder

06:51.216 --> 06:55.303
to regain people's trust.
Is that such a bad thing?

06:55.370 --> 06:56.671
No.

06:56.722 --> 06:58.172
It only is if you use it

06:58.240 --> 07:01.092
to avoid dealing with
what you went through.

07:01.176 --> 07:02.727
But I'm not.

07:02.811 --> 07:05.463
I chose to come back here.

07:05.530 --> 07:08.599
Why? Because I care
about the people I work with?

07:08.684 --> 07:12.270
Yes. But also because
it's clean.

07:12.354 --> 07:14.888
I know who the good guys
and the bad guys are.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.608
I don't have to worry
about screwing someone over

07:17.693 --> 07:18.943
to make a case.

07:19.027 --> 07:22.129
Ok. I want you to make
a deal with me.

07:22.197 --> 07:27.118
You're gonna go weeks,
months even, feeling fine.

07:27.185 --> 07:30.171
And then you're
gonna have a bad day.

07:30.239 --> 07:31.872
Just let me know
when you do.

07:31.924 --> 07:33.357
And that's it?

07:33.425 --> 07:35.343
That's it.

07:35.410 --> 07:37.011
Deal.

07:37.079 --> 07:38.829
Sergio?

07:38.897 --> 07:41.098
He is the perfect man.

07:41.183 --> 07:44.769
He doesn't hog the covers,
and he poops in a box.

07:47.222 --> 07:50.641
I just got the breakdown
of Vanessa Campbell's vomit,

07:50.726 --> 07:53.644
and there's no trace
of Rohypnol or GHB.

07:53.729 --> 07:56.814
Date rape drugs are fast,
but not that fast.

07:56.898 --> 07:59.066
However he's dosing them,
it's not through their stomachs.

07:59.117 --> 08:00.934
Chief, have you been able
to contact all the victims?

08:00.986 --> 08:02.936
The ones
that we could find.

08:02.988 --> 08:05.740
Some moved. And some
wouldn't take our call.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.541
But then the press
got ahold of it,

08:07.609 --> 08:10.378
and the women started
to contact us.

08:10.445 --> 08:13.781
3 more victims admitted
they'd been re-assaulted.

08:13.832 --> 08:16.784
80% of women who are raped
never report it.

08:16.835 --> 08:19.670
Understandable they didn't
want to report it a second time.

08:19.755 --> 08:20.871
Still no DNA.

08:20.939 --> 08:23.624
But what we do have
is a partial fingerprint

08:23.675 --> 08:26.293
from victim number one's
glasses, Regina Lampert.

08:26.345 --> 08:28.546
But we can't match it
to the second assaults

08:28.613 --> 08:31.198
because the forensic
evidence has been destroyed

08:31.266 --> 08:32.515
due to delayed disclosure.

08:32.601 --> 08:34.301
That's how he's
getting away with it.

08:34.352 --> 08:35.969
He's banking on
their silence.

08:38.523 --> 08:40.974
So, then what did you do
after the attack?

08:41.025 --> 08:43.461
I changed everything
about myself.

08:43.528 --> 08:46.163
My hair color,
my clothes, my apartment.

08:46.231 --> 08:48.215
I took self-defense classes.

08:48.283 --> 08:49.533
I'm an orange belt.

08:49.618 --> 08:51.585
And I carry pepper spray
and a whistle.

08:51.653 --> 08:53.170
And that's why I
didn't call the police.

08:53.255 --> 08:55.489
Who's gonna buy that
this happened to me twice?

08:55.540 --> 08:57.491
We do.

08:57.559 --> 08:58.826
Yeah, 'cause you're nice.

08:58.877 --> 09:01.929
Nobody believes a slut
who cries wolf.

09:01.996 --> 09:04.015
We want to go back
to the second attack.

09:04.099 --> 09:08.135
It sounds like you were trying to
restore some normalcy to your life.

09:08.186 --> 09:11.105
My husband told me
that I was at the mall.

09:11.172 --> 09:13.724
I don't remember much.

09:13.809 --> 09:15.443
I completely blacked out.

09:15.510 --> 09:19.280
Both times. Just...

09:19.347 --> 09:21.148
Gone.

09:23.201 --> 09:25.653
Diane.

09:25.704 --> 09:26.871
Are we almost done?

09:26.955 --> 09:28.739
Or can we at least
take a smoke break?

09:28.824 --> 09:30.291
I'm dying here.

09:30.358 --> 09:32.626
You can't smoke in here,
but there's an area outside.

09:32.694 --> 09:35.496
Thank God.

09:37.532 --> 09:39.250
Do you guys have a light?

09:39.334 --> 09:42.803
Did you start smoking
before the assaults or after?

09:43.972 --> 09:45.890
Before. Why?

09:49.377 --> 09:50.478
Yes, Vanessa smokes.

09:50.545 --> 09:51.979
What does it matter?

09:52.046 --> 09:54.498
It might explain how the unsub
is drugging these women.

09:54.566 --> 09:56.484
The media has done a very good
job of warning people

09:56.551 --> 09:58.986
to watch their drinks so that
bars are no longer a fertile

09:59.053 --> 10:00.905
hunting ground, but cigarette
smokers aren't as careful.

10:00.989 --> 10:03.074
They might ask to have
a cigarette from a stranger

10:03.158 --> 10:05.643
or have their pack swapped out of
their purse when they put it down

10:05.710 --> 10:08.162
and then unknowingly inhale
PCP or Scopolamine,

10:08.229 --> 10:10.247
both of which mimic the effects
of date rape drugs.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.450
She hid them in her purse.

10:12.534 --> 10:14.485
She didn't think I knew.

10:14.553 --> 10:17.692
She cracked the windows
so I wouldn't smell it

10:17.693 --> 10:18.669
when I got home.

10:18.673 --> 10:19.874
If the unsub stalked her
from the backyard,

10:19.925 --> 10:21.759
he'd have a good view
when she lit up.

10:21.843 --> 10:23.494
He also took out the window with
something like a center punch.

10:23.562 --> 10:25.412
What's that?

10:25.464 --> 10:28.466
It's a spring-loaded device
used to punch divots into metal.

10:28.550 --> 10:30.134
It also breaks glass.

10:30.218 --> 10:31.969
No cigarettes. He must
have taken them with him

10:32.053 --> 10:33.304
to hide the evidence.

10:33.388 --> 10:37.141
You know, it might not be
all he's trying to hide.

10:37.225 --> 10:39.343
Mr. Campbell, was this on
when you came home?

10:39.411 --> 10:42.095
The police told me
not to touch anything.

10:42.147 --> 10:45.149
You sure got a lot
of MP-3s on here.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.984
Was it playing one of them?

10:47.068 --> 10:48.219
No. Why?

10:48.286 --> 10:49.703
Well, the media center
keeps a history

10:49.771 --> 10:50.955
of the last 20 songs played,

10:51.039 --> 10:52.556
but it looks like
somebody erased it.

10:52.624 --> 10:54.408
It wasn't me.

10:54.459 --> 10:57.244
Ok, I can't tell you
who deleted that playback list,

10:57.312 --> 11:00.798
but I can tell you exactly
when the log was cleared.

11:00.882 --> 11:02.049
7:43 p.m.

11:02.116 --> 11:04.718
Why erase a history
of someone else's music?

11:04.786 --> 11:07.154
Because he didn't erase
someone else's music.

11:07.222 --> 11:11.258
At 7:36 he loaded
an MP-3 via USB drive,

11:11.309 --> 11:14.028
played it, and promptly
deleted it.

11:14.095 --> 11:16.063
Cleared the history
so he could cover up his tracks.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.848
The unsub brought his own
music to an abduction?

11:17.933 --> 11:19.400
Yes, he did,

11:19.468 --> 11:21.252
and that is creepy.

11:21.319 --> 11:24.004
Fortunately, whatever
is imported onto this computer

11:24.072 --> 11:25.489
is downloaded
to the home network,

11:25.574 --> 11:29.160
so, ladies and gentlemen, the
mystery song of Mr. gruesome is...

11:34.282 --> 11:36.100
That's specific.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.668
That's another reason
to call him the piano man.

11:37.752 --> 11:39.019
Turn it off.

11:39.087 --> 11:42.122
Please.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.759
Does this song mean
something to you or your wife?

11:45.827 --> 11:47.378
Vanessa hates it.

11:48.813 --> 11:50.514
I don't know.
How come?

11:50.599 --> 11:52.550
She doesn't know.

11:52.634 --> 11:55.419
But every time it came on the radio,
she'd burst into tears.

11:55.487 --> 11:59.507
So the unsub just happened
to play it the night he came after her.

12:01.693 --> 12:02.810
Can I play?

12:02.861 --> 12:05.613
Hey, you got table 4
ready for me?

12:05.680 --> 12:07.347
Great.

12:09.534 --> 12:10.484
Yeah?

12:10.535 --> 12:11.986
12 is generous.

12:12.037 --> 12:15.456
Looks like somebody's
making a car payment.

12:39.314 --> 12:40.648
Not tonight, ok?

12:40.715 --> 12:43.150
Oh, come on.
Who doesn't love this song?

12:44.853 --> 12:45.769
Me.

12:45.854 --> 12:46.854
I don't.

12:46.905 --> 12:48.439
Ok.

12:48.523 --> 12:50.024
Sorry.

13:06.708 --> 13:07.758
A song?

13:07.842 --> 13:10.794
I know it's kind of
a strange question,

13:10.879 --> 13:13.864
but are there any that trigger
an emotional outburst?

13:13.932 --> 13:17.685
A song that didn't bother
you before the assault.

13:17.752 --> 13:19.587
"Maybe I'm Amazed."

13:19.654 --> 13:23.424
I used to love that song.

13:23.491 --> 13:25.142
Ok, great. Good. We done?

13:25.226 --> 13:28.028
Not quite. Um,

13:28.096 --> 13:31.365
your comment about
the slut who cries wolf.

13:31.432 --> 13:33.892
It made us wonder
if there was something else

13:33.917 --> 13:35.248
you wanted to tell us.

13:37.422 --> 13:39.156
Did you lose consciousness?

13:39.224 --> 13:40.624
I blacked out. I--

13:40.709 --> 13:42.576
Diana, you're safe here.
Whatever it is--

13:42.627 --> 13:44.378
I just don't remember
anything.

13:45.747 --> 13:48.882
"Lady in Red," "Up Where
We Belong," "Glory of Love."

13:48.950 --> 13:50.668
Each victim has
her own piano ballad.

13:50.752 --> 13:53.887
You know, considering the survivors
lose consciousness during the rape,

13:53.955 --> 13:55.839
we think this functions
as the unsub's signature.

13:55.924 --> 13:57.891
He most likely plays the songs
repeatedly during the assault,

13:57.959 --> 13:59.793
resulting in
a Pavlovian response

13:59.844 --> 14:03.147
when they hear it later, sort of
a subconscious rape trigger.

14:03.231 --> 14:04.965
The night of Vanessa
Campbell's abduction,

14:05.016 --> 14:06.750
that signature became
part of his torture.

14:06.818 --> 14:09.303
Why these songs?
What do they say about him?

14:12.223 --> 14:14.291
Go ahead, Morgan?

14:14.359 --> 14:15.976
We just found
Vanessa Campbell's body.

14:16.027 --> 14:17.477
He didn't even bother
hiding it.

14:17.529 --> 14:18.912
How long has she been dead?

14:18.980 --> 14:20.447
Maybe 5 hours.

14:20.498 --> 14:22.683
He's never killed before.
Are we sure it's our unsub?

14:22.751 --> 14:25.436
He used a piano wire
as a garrote.

14:25.503 --> 14:27.121
I'm not seeing my keys.

14:27.146 --> 14:29.675
I can't find anything
in this bag.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.826
Normally the waitress
has to pour me into a cab,

14:32.877 --> 14:34.161
Not the other way around.

14:34.212 --> 14:35.295
Oh, really?

14:35.347 --> 14:38.382
Well, this is me.

14:38.466 --> 14:40.768
I'm, um, I'm the SUV.
I'm sorry.

14:40.835 --> 14:42.636
Uh...

14:42.687 --> 14:44.555
Listen, I know we just met.

14:44.639 --> 14:47.808
I can't, uh,
I can't let you drive like this.

14:47.859 --> 14:51.528
Ah...Drive?
I'm sleeping in this bitch.

14:51.613 --> 14:53.564
Don't be silly.

14:53.648 --> 14:55.149
Um...

14:55.200 --> 14:57.451
Uh, lock your doors.

14:57.518 --> 14:59.737
A lot of--a lot of creeps
out there. Ok?

14:59.821 --> 15:01.605
Ok.

15:01.673 --> 15:03.290
Well...Good night.

15:03.357 --> 15:05.409
Good night.

15:05.493 --> 15:08.195
Hey.

15:08.246 --> 15:10.798
You have a cigarette?

15:10.865 --> 15:13.801
Uh...Heh heh.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.136
Yes, I do.

15:16.204 --> 15:18.472
Just, uh,
don't tell my wife.

15:18.539 --> 15:20.424
I promised her I'd quit.

15:20.508 --> 15:22.259
Ok.
Yeah.

15:23.311 --> 15:25.229
It'll be
our little secret.

15:25.313 --> 15:26.897
Ok.

15:30.602 --> 15:34.655
You know, I never knew
why I hated that song so much.

15:34.722 --> 15:37.574
But tonight...

15:37.659 --> 15:39.993
You helped me
figure it out.

15:40.061 --> 15:41.161
I--I did, huh?

15:41.229 --> 15:43.080
Yeah, you did.

15:43.164 --> 15:45.666
That's the song you played
when you raped me.

15:45.733 --> 15:47.284
What?

15:59.914 --> 16:02.349
I was hoping
you'd come back.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.970
Tissue inflammation
is consistent

16:19.021 --> 16:21.355
with inhalation
of some sort of drug.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.857
I can't tell what yet.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.358
And the ligature marks?

16:24.443 --> 16:26.060
Same as before.

16:26.144 --> 16:28.145
New wounds
on top of old scares.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.782
No sexual assault, though.
Possibly because

16:31.850 --> 16:33.567
she regained consciousness
at some point

16:33.652 --> 16:35.036
and fought back.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.438
She doesn't show any signs
of defensive wounds.

16:37.506 --> 16:43.027
No, but I did fish this
out of her trachea.

16:43.078 --> 16:44.879
Neoprene.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.580
From a glove.

16:46.665 --> 16:49.550
My best guess is
she bit him.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.585
Not enough to break
the skin, unfortunately.

16:51.670 --> 16:52.720
An exam glove?

16:52.804 --> 16:54.472
Most likely.

16:54.539 --> 16:56.257
Actually,
it's a surgical glove.

16:56.341 --> 16:57.725
A little bit thicker
than an exam glove.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.895
If he was wearing neoprene,
it means he has an allergy to latex.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.015
I'll have Garcia
check hospital records.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.721
What the hell?

17:13.407 --> 17:16.861
Uh--ah--

17:21.249 --> 17:23.917
he-help!

17:25.420 --> 17:28.372
Somebody help me!

17:36.748 --> 17:39.550
Hello?!

17:41.269 --> 17:43.471
Hello?! Is there
somebody there?

17:46.274 --> 17:47.892
♪ Turn around

17:47.943 --> 17:51.562
♪ every now and then
I get a little bit lonely ♪

17:51.613 --> 17:53.564
♪ and you never come around

17:53.615 --> 17:54.899
♪ turn around

17:54.950 --> 17:57.902
♪ every now and then
I get a little bit lonely... ♪

17:57.953 --> 18:00.488
Do you recognize
this outfit?

18:00.572 --> 18:03.057
I wore it the night we met.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.376
I don't remember exactly,

18:05.444 --> 18:09.980
but friends heard me say
I was going outside for a smoke.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.866
Who are you?

18:11.933 --> 18:14.385
You really don't remember?

18:14.452 --> 18:18.606
No. Uh, l-last night,
we met last night.

18:21.610 --> 18:24.728
That's ok.

18:24.796 --> 18:27.297
Because I remember you.

18:27.349 --> 18:29.650
Pieces of you, anyway.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.019
I guess because
I was your first,

18:32.104 --> 18:34.321
you didn't know
how to drug me right,

18:34.406 --> 18:36.991
and I kept coming to.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.692
What are you talking about?

18:38.777 --> 18:43.030
I remember how you were
panting behind your mask,

18:43.115 --> 18:46.417
and how your sweat

18:46.484 --> 18:48.836
dripped on my skin.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.704
But most of all...

18:50.789 --> 18:54.324
Ok, this is a misunderstanding.

18:54.376 --> 18:55.543
Aah!

18:58.997 --> 19:02.616
I remember that song.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.502
So first he evolves
to revictimizing these women.

19:05.554 --> 19:08.505
Then he evolves again
to killing them.

19:08.557 --> 19:11.559
The story's in the press.
He knows we're hunting him.

19:11.643 --> 19:14.011
The murders, like the gloves,
are a countermeasure.

19:14.062 --> 19:16.346
Right. He's a rapist
first and foremost.

19:16.398 --> 19:17.848
That's his primary
motivation.

19:17.899 --> 19:19.826
So then why not rape
Vanessa Campbell

19:19.851 --> 19:21.051
for the second time?

19:21.453 --> 19:23.187
He lost control
when she fought back.

19:23.238 --> 19:25.372
He couldn't risk
her identifying him.

19:25.457 --> 19:28.025
Ok, maybe that's his new
primary motivation.

19:28.076 --> 19:29.627
He wants to stay hidden.

19:29.694 --> 19:32.446
But look at all the details
we've learned about him already.

19:32.514 --> 19:34.865
The victims could have
more clues to his identity

19:34.916 --> 19:36.500
locked away
in their subconscious.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.470
So he kills them
before we can unlock it.

19:40.922 --> 19:42.206
Go ahead, Garcia.

19:42.257 --> 19:43.707
Sir, I have struck out
on surgeons.

19:43.758 --> 19:45.809
In fact,
none of the survivors

19:45.877 --> 19:47.394
saw the same two
healthcare professionals

19:47.479 --> 19:49.396
or went to
the same hospitals.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.881
But then, I asked myself,

19:50.932 --> 19:53.484
what would SSA Hotchner do?

19:53.551 --> 19:56.220
And I imagined myself
in a really good suit,

19:56.271 --> 19:58.222
what did you find out?
And I widened my search.

19:58.273 --> 20:01.475
I found an orderly
whose name is Herman Scobie,

20:01.543 --> 20:03.277
who rotates shifts
at 3 different hospitals.

20:03.361 --> 20:04.895
The same hospitals
the victims go to?

20:04.946 --> 20:08.315
Yes, indeed they are. And
according to the hospital networks,

20:08.383 --> 20:11.085
accessed their insurance
months after the attacks.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.003
That's how he finds
the victims a second time.

20:13.071 --> 20:14.505
We should talk to him.

20:15.740 --> 20:16.790
Diana.

20:18.376 --> 20:21.095
He killed Vanessa?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.097
Yes.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.250
He could be after
any one of us now, right?

20:26.301 --> 20:29.086
Is this because of what
I played last night?

20:29.137 --> 20:30.170
Wait, stop! No!

20:30.238 --> 20:33.307
Wait. It's a stupid,
cheesy song.

20:33.391 --> 20:36.426
I only learned it
so I could serenade my wife

20:36.478 --> 20:38.028
when I asked her
to marry me.

20:38.096 --> 20:41.615
You can't even lie
convincingly.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.933
It's not a lie.

20:42.984 --> 20:46.036
You sang "Total Eclipse
of the Heart" to your wife?

20:46.104 --> 20:48.939
It's kind of a crap song
to propose to.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.674
But it wasn't.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.380
That--that's not what
I played last night.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.549
You're confused. Ok?

20:58.616 --> 21:01.502
Look, I can, uh,
I can prove it to you.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.570
There are certain things
that you notice

21:03.638 --> 21:05.673
when you're a lifelong smoker.

21:05.757 --> 21:07.825
I could tell
that it tasted funny,

21:07.892 --> 21:09.727
so I crushed it.

21:09.794 --> 21:13.847
I guess I got enough,
because I was out, but...

21:13.932 --> 21:17.084
I wasn't out out, you know?

21:17.152 --> 21:20.104
Because you didn't inhale as much
as the other victims.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.742
All right? Ok.

21:24.809 --> 21:30.030
This is what
I played last night.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.121
It's the same song.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.256
No, it's not.

21:39.324 --> 21:42.760
Listen. Listen.

21:47.832 --> 21:49.767
It is the same song.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.769
It's the same. What, do you think
I can't hear that?

21:51.836 --> 21:52.770
No! No!

21:52.837 --> 21:53.937
It's the same song!

21:54.005 --> 21:55.005
Wait, stop.

21:55.056 --> 21:57.391
It was--it was written
by the same guy.

21:57.475 --> 21:59.393
That's why it sounds
like it's the same song.

21:59.477 --> 22:01.996
Prove it.
How do they go?

22:03.315 --> 22:05.399
I woke up...

22:05.483 --> 22:09.536
In his van.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.205
He wore a mask.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.540
I never saw his face.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.876
But there were other things,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.412
things that were different
from what you described.

22:18.496 --> 22:20.914
Things he did?

22:20.999 --> 22:22.082
Things he didn't do.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.917
He didn't tie me up.

22:24.002 --> 22:27.054
And there wasn't a song.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.424
He talked to me,
but there wasn't a song.

22:30.508 --> 22:32.726
Do you remember
what he said?

22:32.811 --> 22:34.828
No.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.981
When he was done, he bashed
my head into the floor of his van.

22:49.828 --> 22:50.894
FBI!

22:56.501 --> 22:58.335
Out the back!

23:03.007 --> 23:05.292
- What are you doing?
- What is---- What is this?

23:05.377 --> 23:07.678
Sometimes in my dreams...

23:09.931 --> 23:12.699
I can still hear his voice.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.686
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.

23:15.753 --> 23:16.937
This one goes...

23:17.021 --> 23:18.722
♪ and I know

23:18.773 --> 23:22.042
♪ just how to whisper

23:22.110 --> 23:23.811
Right?

23:23.895 --> 23:26.563
And the other one goes...

23:26.614 --> 23:29.066
♪ Turn around

23:29.117 --> 23:31.235
♪ bright eyes

23:31.286 --> 23:32.453
You see?

23:35.123 --> 23:36.957
Thank you.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.463
Why you running?

23:42.547 --> 23:44.548
Why do you come to my house
waving guns around?

23:44.615 --> 23:46.917
Because we're looking
for a rapist and a killer.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.402
You know anyone like that?

23:48.470 --> 23:49.720
Not me.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.507
Morgan.

23:53.591 --> 23:55.309
Neoprene.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.311
That is you.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.681
I know you're him.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.935
You see, you didn't
just play that song

24:03.960 --> 24:05.160
over and over again

24:05.636 --> 24:08.689
when you ravaged me
5 years ago.

24:08.773 --> 24:11.275
You sang it.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.927
The same way
you sang it right now.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.930
That--that's your proof?

24:16.998 --> 24:18.365
It's all I need.

24:18.450 --> 24:22.085
You got the wrong guy.
You're making a mistake.

24:22.153 --> 24:24.621
Oh! For God's sake!
It's not me!

24:24.672 --> 24:25.956
I'm not the guy!

24:26.007 --> 24:28.442
Yeah. It's you.

24:29.711 --> 24:30.844
Oh, my God!

24:30.929 --> 24:33.230
Aah...

24:38.719 --> 24:40.752
You know,
according to Wikipedia,

24:41.163 --> 24:44.299
you've got 48 hours
before gangrene sets in.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.784
Less if I starve you.

24:45.851 --> 24:50.138
So, uh...You want
a sandwich or something?

24:50.206 --> 24:51.523
What's the point?

24:51.607 --> 24:54.059
You've already decided
who I am.

24:54.143 --> 24:57.062
Um, the point is
you've ruined my life,

24:57.146 --> 25:00.782
and I want to make you
take responsibility for that.

25:00.849 --> 25:03.451
I never did anything to you
you didn't want.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.871
What?

25:09.158 --> 25:12.410
Do you see this?

25:12.495 --> 25:15.413
This made my mother cry
in the examination room

25:15.498 --> 25:17.732
when the police
took photos of it.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.302
And these, here.

25:21.370 --> 25:23.304
These made my father ask me

25:23.372 --> 25:25.640
if I had too much to drink
that night.

25:25.708 --> 25:28.643
And...

25:28.711 --> 25:29.711
This one.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.980
This one was so deep
that my fiance decided

25:32.047 --> 25:34.315
that he could never
touch me again.

25:34.383 --> 25:36.935
Now, is that what
you really think,

25:37.019 --> 25:39.387
that I wanted this?

25:39.438 --> 25:43.558
That's not what
I'm talking about.

25:43.609 --> 25:47.362
You mixed me up.

25:47.413 --> 25:50.415
Just like you did
the songs.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.004
Hi.

25:56.071 --> 25:57.956
Where's my lawyer?

25:59.074 --> 26:00.392
We called him.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.843
He's on his way.
I'll tell you what--

26:01.910 --> 26:05.847
I'm gonna let him fill you in
on the Piano Man investigation.

26:05.914 --> 26:06.848
On the what?

26:06.915 --> 26:07.849
The Piano Man.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.384
You might have read
about him.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.052
A little.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.920
What, you think I'm him?

26:15.441 --> 26:16.391
No.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.376
At least I don't.

26:18.444 --> 26:22.697
The problem is, the way you treat
some of your dates

26:22.765 --> 26:24.699
is a little similar
to this guy.

26:24.767 --> 26:27.368
Now, I'm not judging.

26:27.436 --> 26:29.320
Some guys like it rough.

26:29.405 --> 26:32.373
In fact...

26:32.441 --> 26:33.875
Never mind.

26:33.942 --> 26:35.827
No, go ahead.

26:35.911 --> 26:39.380
No, I can't.

26:39.448 --> 26:41.299
Maybe you already did.

26:46.789 --> 26:48.389
Most of the people here

26:48.457 --> 26:51.726
aren't as understanding
as I am.

26:51.794 --> 26:55.413
So, between us,

26:55.481 --> 26:58.016
did you ever get
a little too rough?

26:58.100 --> 27:00.735
Heat of the moment?

27:00.803 --> 27:02.537
Never.

27:02.605 --> 27:04.572
Never?

27:04.640 --> 27:06.908
Never.

27:06.975 --> 27:10.161
What about those naughty girls
who came back for seconds?

27:10.246 --> 27:11.646
What about them?

27:11.697 --> 27:14.949
They're the ones
screeching the loudest.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.335
What I need from you is a
reason to kick them to the curb.

27:17.419 --> 27:20.171
Look at the notches
on their bedpost.

27:20.256 --> 27:23.107
You think
they're innocent?

27:23.175 --> 27:27.178
That's a good one.

27:27.263 --> 27:30.632
Besides,
nobody believes a slut

27:30.683 --> 27:32.133
who cries wolf.

27:34.303 --> 27:35.603
Right?

27:40.643 --> 27:42.443
I'm gonna quote you
on that.

27:47.983 --> 27:51.486
That--that--that was just something
I told myself

27:51.537 --> 27:55.790
- after the second time.
- How did he--

27:55.858 --> 27:58.793
Your brain remembers details no
matter how hard you try to forget it.

27:58.861 --> 28:00.662
It's just like the song.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.664
It's him.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.332
We got a positive I.D.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.817
We'll arraign him.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.002
We're not done. We're gonna stay
and help the D.A.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.621
build an airtight case.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.507
Gonna be tough if most of the
victims can't identify him.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.726
That's why we use
his signature against him.

28:14.810 --> 28:17.228
We establish a link between
each of the victims and her song.

28:17.313 --> 28:18.513
How does that work, exactly?

28:18.564 --> 28:20.598
Are we gonna enter
his song library into evidence?

28:20.683 --> 28:23.952
If it's relevant, yes. We'll
categorize every piece of music he owns,

28:24.019 --> 28:25.920
every MP-3, CD,
old cassettes, everything.

28:25.988 --> 28:28.907
And we establish these songs were
important to him and we go at him again.

28:28.991 --> 28:30.358
He's lawyering up.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.694
He raped 12 women
and he killed one.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.646
We're gonna make
every charge stick.

28:42.338 --> 28:43.538
Hello.

28:45.507 --> 28:47.141
What?

28:47.209 --> 28:48.710
I know.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.880
That's--that's great.

28:51.931 --> 28:56.301
Um, listen,
can I call you back?

28:56.385 --> 28:58.102
Ok.

29:05.060 --> 29:08.897
...confirmed that an arrest has been
made in the Piano Man case.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.865
The suspect's name
has not been released yet,

29:10.933 --> 29:13.384
but a spokesman for the
Houston police has confirmed

29:13.452 --> 29:17.338
he is in custody and could be
arraigned as early as this evening.

29:33.589 --> 29:35.673
What did you mean?

29:35.758 --> 29:37.859
What did I mix up?

29:37.927 --> 29:40.745
We've met before.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.281
Just not the way
you remember.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.518
Evanescence. Linkin Park.

29:47.603 --> 29:49.070
And Nickelback.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.856
So Herman Scobie's into
that nu-metal goth stuff.

29:51.941 --> 29:54.492
Yeah, and his tramp stamp
probably spells out "Massengill."

29:54.576 --> 29:58.529
This guy doesn't even have
any rage against the machine.

29:59.531 --> 30:00.565
I rock.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.866
How old were you

30:01.951 --> 30:03.418
when you started
listening to that band?

30:03.485 --> 30:06.004
Uh, I was probably
a teenager. Why?

30:06.088 --> 30:08.873
14 is when we start to make
our own musical choices.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.009
Our cognitive development
evolves at that age

30:11.093 --> 30:12.543
and we start to form
our own cultural identity.

30:12.628 --> 30:15.046
We stop listening to the music
that our parents put on

30:15.130 --> 30:17.415
and we start listening to the
music that our friends listen to.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.500
And those musical experiences
imprint on us.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.885
Our hormonal surges
as teenagers

30:20.970 --> 30:22.887
may make the choices seem
more personal and passionate.

30:22.972 --> 30:25.390
And later on in life we might
experiment with other musical selections,

30:25.474 --> 30:27.971
but no music ever impacts us
as much as that which

30:27.996 --> 30:29.378
we listen to at age 14.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.895
Herman Scobie's what, 30?

30:30.980 --> 30:32.030
If that.

30:32.114 --> 30:34.449
Ok, so mid- to late nineties
is when he started

30:34.516 --> 30:36.284
to take music seriously,
stuff like this.

30:36.351 --> 30:38.636
And the Piano Man's songs
were all early eighties.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.238
Which means the signature
doesn't fit.

30:40.322 --> 30:41.956
Herman Scobie's too young
to be the Piano Man.

30:42.024 --> 30:46.127
I used to go to this bar,
the Golden Gun. You know it?

30:46.195 --> 30:47.962
I've been to lots
of bars.

30:48.030 --> 30:50.198
This one was special.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.668
They had a happy hour
every Wednesday night.

30:53.719 --> 30:56.671
And every Wednesday night
I'd be there.

30:56.722 --> 31:01.175
And every Wednesday night
I'd notice this woman.

31:01.226 --> 31:04.145
Long blond hair,
horn-rimmed glasses.

31:04.213 --> 31:08.166
Every week she'd let
a different guy pick her up.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.485
It was like a deal.

31:10.552 --> 31:13.387
She could come back
but he couldn't.

31:16.892 --> 31:19.127
You remember the bar now?

31:19.194 --> 31:20.228
Yeah.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.729
Yeah.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.248
One night,
she was so trashed,

31:24.333 --> 31:27.668
I couldn't understand
what she was saying.

31:27.736 --> 31:31.405
It was "your place."

31:31.457 --> 31:33.574
And when we got there,

31:33.592 --> 31:36.627
she told me...

31:36.712 --> 31:38.830
Not to ask her
about them.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.349
That's when I saw the scars.

31:43.852 --> 31:46.604
The next morning
she was gone.

31:46.688 --> 31:49.423
I kept my side
of the bargain.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.360
I never went back.

31:52.427 --> 31:56.197
But I wondered about her.

31:56.264 --> 31:57.682
Who she was.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.202
What happened to her.

32:01.269 --> 32:06.674
Now I see these
same scars on my wrist...

32:09.277 --> 32:12.780
And I have my answer,
don't I?

32:12.831 --> 32:17.218
You think you know me?

32:18.754 --> 32:23.224
I know who you are, Regina.

32:28.097 --> 32:30.898
How can Herman Scobie
not be the Piano Man?

32:30.966 --> 32:34.352
We've got the medical gloves,
the medical records he pulled.

32:34.436 --> 32:36.771
The taunt said to Diana Mitchell
he repeated to us.

32:36.822 --> 32:40.057
Scobie definitely assaulted
Diana the second time.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.360
He's probably re-victimizing
all of the survivors.

32:42.444 --> 32:44.812
But apply the profile
to Herman Scobie

32:44.863 --> 32:46.280
and look at
what's different.

32:46.331 --> 32:48.249
There's no piano wire
and there's no song played.

32:48.316 --> 32:50.751
You think there are two unsubs,
the piano man and a copycat?

32:50.819 --> 32:53.704
A copycat studies the original
unsub in order to learn.

32:53.789 --> 32:55.039
Herman Scobie's a doppelganger.

32:55.124 --> 32:57.425
He's trying to pass himself off
as the Piano Man.

32:57.492 --> 32:58.676
Why?

32:58.760 --> 32:59.844
Convenience, maybe.

32:59.928 --> 33:01.762
If he assaults
the Piano Man's survivors,

33:01.830 --> 33:03.598
they're less likely
to reach out to the police.

33:03.665 --> 33:06.083
And if they do, women claim
it was the piano man.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.752
No one thinks to look
at hospital orderlies.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.437
So who killed
Vanessa Campbell,

33:09.504 --> 33:11.389
the Piano Man
or Scobie?

33:11.456 --> 33:12.736
It's a lay-up. Same neoprene
glove in her throat

33:12.761 --> 33:14.261
as we found in Scobie's van.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.027
There's something odd
about that, too, though.

33:16.111 --> 33:17.678
If Vanessa Campbell
swallowed this,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.197
it would be scarred
by digestive acids.

33:19.281 --> 33:21.532
Even if it got caught in her
trachea as he choked her out,

33:21.617 --> 33:23.100
gastric reflux would be
evident, but there isn't any.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.887
So the unsub placed that
in her throat postmortem.

33:25.954 --> 33:26.954
Which unsub?

33:27.022 --> 33:28.539
He used the piano wire,
he played the song,

33:28.624 --> 33:30.291
it must have been
the Piano Man.

33:30.358 --> 33:32.210
So he plants a piece of evidence
to frame Scobie.

33:32.294 --> 33:33.544
Ok, let me
get this straight.

33:33.629 --> 33:36.380
The Piano Man
is trying to convince us

33:36.465 --> 33:39.217
that Scobie is responsible
for all of these crimes.

33:39.301 --> 33:41.702
And if these two have studied
each other this closely,

33:41.753 --> 33:43.554
then Scobie is the key
to finding the Piano Man.

33:43.639 --> 33:45.923
His lawyer's here. Scobie's
not gonna talk to us.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.192
He will when he finds
out he's been set up.

33:49.645 --> 33:51.378
My client
has nothing to say.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.147
Good. We'd rather
he listen, anyway.

33:53.215 --> 33:55.349
You're going away
for rape.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.019
The question is whether
you'll let your competition

33:58.070 --> 34:00.838
hang Vanessa Campbell's
murder on you as well.

34:00.906 --> 34:03.858
I didn't kill her.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.526
I didn't even touch her.
Herman.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.759
From what you've told us,
we know exactly what

34:06.784 --> 34:07.984
you think of these women.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.164
You don't need
to kill them.

34:10.232 --> 34:12.366
They're not worth
that much effort to you.

34:12.434 --> 34:14.435
But the Piano Man
can't take that risk.

34:14.503 --> 34:17.205
When he'd heard what you'd done,
he killed Vanessa Campbell.

34:17.272 --> 34:19.623
He went back
to an old victim,

34:19.690 --> 34:21.042
just like you,

34:21.092 --> 34:24.695
but then placed a piece
of neoprene down her throat.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.496
Does that sound like
an accident?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.266
He's setting you up.

34:28.350 --> 34:30.384
I need to discuss this
with my client.

34:30.435 --> 34:33.054
No, he talks to us now or he takes
his chances with a jury.

34:33.121 --> 34:34.855
What do you want to know?

34:37.025 --> 34:38.326
Who is he?

34:38.393 --> 34:40.945
I never met him.

34:41.029 --> 34:43.931
I just read
about what he did

34:43.982 --> 34:47.400
in the hospital records.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.437
A weird thing, though.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.772
What?

34:51.822 --> 34:56.827
I had two chicks
picked out to do next.

34:56.911 --> 34:59.997
I was gonna start
with Vanessa, but...

35:00.082 --> 35:02.266
He got to he first.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.952
Who was the other one?

35:06.288 --> 35:08.673
Regina Lampert.

35:13.929 --> 35:16.230
Regina?

35:17.599 --> 35:19.817
What are you doing?

35:19.901 --> 35:22.536
Regina, I'm--
I'm begging you,

35:22.604 --> 35:25.239
I've lost a lot of blood.

35:26.275 --> 35:29.476
I need to go to the hospital.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.478
Regina?

36:05.688 --> 36:07.289
Help!

36:30.980 --> 36:33.181
No...

36:33.266 --> 36:34.950
Aah!

36:43.559 --> 36:45.560
Ok, guys, Regina Lampert
is not answering her phone,

36:45.645 --> 36:48.396
and I found something hinky on her,
which I'm sending to your tablets.

36:48.481 --> 36:50.014
All right, Garcia,
what are we looking at?

36:50.066 --> 36:52.400
It's surveillance video from the bar
that Regina Lampert works at.

36:52.485 --> 36:54.453
Do you see the guy
she's talking to?

36:54.520 --> 36:56.521
- Playing the piano.
- He's taunting her.

36:56.572 --> 36:59.207
She knows it, too.
Look at her body language.

36:59.292 --> 37:02.461
Watch what happens when I
fast-forward to closing time.

37:02.528 --> 37:05.697
She seems to
warm up to him.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.215
And then watch this.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.217
Garcia,
freeze it right there.

37:09.302 --> 37:11.419
Look at her face.
No, she doesn't.

37:11.504 --> 37:12.754
She's set herself up
as bait.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.306
Credit card says that
the guy at the piano

37:14.373 --> 37:16.558
is Hamilton Bartholomew.
This is what I know--

37:16.642 --> 37:19.261
his wife just filed a missing persons
report on him this morning.

37:19.345 --> 37:21.179
She directed me to some job
he just applied for,

37:21.230 --> 37:23.982
so I did a background check from that
where they did his fingerprints.

37:24.049 --> 37:26.151
All right, Garcia,
pull Regina Lampert's rape kit

37:26.218 --> 37:27.986
and cross-reference the prints
found with Bartholomew's

37:28.053 --> 37:29.237
and see if you get a match.

37:29.322 --> 37:30.822
We need to get to her house.

37:30.890 --> 37:32.274
Sending her address
into your GPS.

37:32.358 --> 37:33.358
Godspeed.

38:13.032 --> 38:15.116
Garcia, did she pick up?

38:15.201 --> 38:17.285
No, but we did get a 911
call from her house

38:17.370 --> 38:19.204
and it is freaking weird.

38:19.271 --> 38:21.456
911 operator.
What's your emergency?

38:21.541 --> 38:22.457
Hello?

38:22.542 --> 38:24.275
My name is
Hamilton Bartholomew.

38:24.327 --> 38:26.711
I'm being held captive
by a lunatic!

38:28.664 --> 38:30.465
She took the Piano Man
captive?

38:30.550 --> 38:33.117
Unless he's not the Piano Man.
I mean, think about it.

38:33.169 --> 38:35.153
Would the Piano Man
call us to rescue him?

38:35.221 --> 38:36.788
She could be shooting
at the wrong guy.

38:36.839 --> 38:38.790
Garcia, keep trying the house.

38:40.059 --> 38:41.810
It's the lab. They've
run the fingerprints.

38:41.894 --> 38:42.928
Hello?

38:49.635 --> 38:50.902
FBI!

38:50.970 --> 38:53.905
I got him!
I caught him!

38:53.973 --> 38:55.590
This is the Piano Man.

38:55.658 --> 38:57.692
No, I'm not.
This woman's crazy.

38:57.777 --> 39:00.078
Regina, look at me.

39:00.145 --> 39:03.431
Look at me. Drop the gun, ok?

39:03.499 --> 39:06.084
Please don't let her
kill me.

39:06.151 --> 39:11.122
I have waited 5 years
for this.

39:11.173 --> 39:14.042
We ran
the rape kit, Regina.

39:14.126 --> 39:16.845
The fingerprint the police
got off your glasses.

39:16.929 --> 39:19.214
Do you remember?
We compared it to Hamilton's.

39:19.298 --> 39:21.299
It didn't match.

39:25.638 --> 39:27.906
That's impossible.

39:27.974 --> 39:31.309
That's...That's him.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.510
That's him.

39:32.561 --> 39:34.178
If you pull that trigger,

39:34.230 --> 39:36.665
you're gonna kill
an innocent man.

39:38.034 --> 39:39.317
But...But...

39:39.368 --> 39:41.820
Drop the gun.

39:41.871 --> 39:43.288
But...

39:43.355 --> 39:45.156
It's...

39:51.314 --> 39:52.998
Yeah. Yeah. I can walk.
Can you walk?

39:53.049 --> 39:54.549
I have to put these on you.
To you understand?

39:54.634 --> 39:57.702
This is for
both of our safety.

40:02.975 --> 40:05.343
Hamilton Bartholomew, you're under
arrest for the rapes of 12 women

40:05.394 --> 40:07.095
and the murder
of Vanessa Campbell.

40:27.232 --> 40:31.036
I was told that you would
only give your statement to me.

40:33.339 --> 40:36.291
Why didn't you let me
pull the trigger?

40:36.375 --> 40:38.677
Because you would be
in prison.

40:41.547 --> 40:43.531
As opposed to where I am
right now?

40:43.599 --> 40:46.451
I mean, while he gets
a lawyer

40:46.519 --> 40:49.287
and a fair trial.

40:49.355 --> 40:52.607
He will never
see the light of day, ever.

40:52.692 --> 40:55.894
Can you guarantee that?

40:58.280 --> 41:01.983
You know, when they talk
about victims

41:02.068 --> 41:04.719
getting revictimized
by the system,

41:04.787 --> 41:06.821
they mean you.

41:08.574 --> 41:10.158
I know it's hard--

41:10.242 --> 41:11.526
No, you don't.

41:11.594 --> 41:16.581
You have no idea
what it's like...

41:18.250 --> 41:21.953
When the monster from your
nightmares comes back for you.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.692
Wait--

41:27.760 --> 41:29.177
Look, I'm here as a courtesy.

41:29.261 --> 41:30.795
Something happened to you.

41:30.846 --> 41:32.847
So do you want to give me
your statement or not?

41:32.915 --> 41:35.183
What did you do to him, huh?

41:35.267 --> 41:41.573
Did you arrest him
like a good FBI Agent?

41:43.626 --> 41:44.943
Or did you kill him?

41:50.315 --> 41:52.650
I didn't pull the trigger.

41:52.701 --> 41:54.486
Still,

41:54.553 --> 41:57.338
your monster's dead.

42:01.544 --> 42:03.978
I have to live with mine.

42:07.633 --> 42:09.768
That's my statement.

42:13.639 --> 42:16.858
"All the art of living
lies in a fine mingling

42:16.942 --> 42:19.310
of letting go
and holding on."

42:19.361 --> 42:20.645
Henry Ellis.

42:38.247 --> 42:40.965
I'm having a bad day.
