WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:46.411 --> 01:48.811
At last.

01:50.415 --> 01:52.474
I have it, Skeletor.

02:03.328 --> 02:05.159
The Wheel of Infinity.

02:05.397 --> 02:09.356
The ultimate key to the
destruction of Castle Grayskull.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.770
Great power, Skeletor.

02:13.038 --> 02:16.701
But is it enough to destroy Grayskull?

02:16.942 --> 02:21.106
When the Wheel is in the right spot,
there won't be a Castle Grayskull...

02:21.413 --> 02:24.007
and I shall rule all Eternia.

02:24.282 --> 02:25.647
What about He-Man?

02:27.085 --> 02:30.782
Where we're going,
even He-Man can't stop us.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.447
And where is that?

02:32.724 --> 02:35.124
We are going back in time.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.320
To a time when there
was no Castle Grayskull.

02:56.314 --> 02:58.043
Marvelous day for a picnic.

02:58.316 --> 03:00.181
And some magic.

03:00.205 --> 03:01.297
Lets see...

03:01.987 --> 03:03.215
Ah... just the thing.

03:03.555 --> 03:05.489
Tasty prize, double the size.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.718
Now there's a useful trick.

03:13.565 --> 03:15.465
I believe thats big enough.

03:16.435 --> 03:17.766
Must have overdone it.

03:21.139 --> 03:22.629
Oh well.

03:33.318 --> 03:34.376
Orko!

03:45.897 --> 03:46.897
Zoar!

03:50.736 --> 03:52.931
She's summoning us to Castle Grayskull.

03:53.205 --> 03:54.205
Let's go.

03:54.940 --> 03:58.205
The only place I want to go is home.

04:09.488 --> 04:10.887
Thank you for coming.

04:11.289 --> 04:12.813
There is danger lurking.

04:13.358 --> 04:16.521
Look into the window of
time and see the danger.

04:30.475 --> 04:31.475
Skeletor!

04:33.545 --> 04:36.946
That demon is building a
fortress, but where?

04:37.349 --> 04:41.410
Here, on the very spot where
Castle Grayskull stands.

04:41.686 --> 04:42.914
Thats impossible.

04:43.555 --> 04:44.555
Isn't it?

04:44.790 --> 04:45.882
Unfortunately no.

04:46.191 --> 04:50.719
Skeletor has opened a corridor of time,
and traveled back to Eternia's past.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.463
What good will a fortress in the past do?

04:53.765 --> 04:56.290
The fortress protects
the Wheel of Infinity.

04:56.668 --> 05:02.106
If Skeletor starts the wheel spinning,
it will go faster and faster...

05:02.440 --> 05:07.002
and grow larger and larger, until
it is fast enough and big enough...

05:07.245 --> 05:08.610
to destroy this castle.

05:08.914 --> 05:11.610
And Skeletor's evil will rule Eternia.

05:11.950 --> 05:15.249
You must go back in time and stop Skeletor.

05:15.754 --> 05:16.812
The let's do it.

05:17.088 --> 05:19.386
By power of Grayskull.

05:21.393 --> 05:25.420
Oh, I was afraid this would happen.

05:29.801 --> 05:33.931
I have the power!

05:46.585 --> 05:50.214
The language of Eternia's
past will be strange to you.

05:50.589 --> 05:52.682
But Orko will know what to do about it.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.391
I will, I mean yeah...

05:54.693 --> 05:56.661
yes of course. I will... I hope.

06:00.198 --> 06:01.927
Time is delicate, He-Man.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.892
Do your job swiftly.

06:21.653 --> 06:25.885
So, this is is what Evergreen
Forest looked like in the past.

06:26.725 --> 06:30.684
Yeah and I guess thats what
Eternians looked like.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.430
Sanda cata, cata shiaru.

06:39.771 --> 06:42.365
Easy, Battle Cat, we want to be friends.

06:42.707 --> 06:46.404
Orko, the Sorceress said you could
make sense of their language.

06:46.711 --> 06:50.112
Right, eh,
if I could just remember that spell.

06:50.448 --> 06:53.849
Let's see, uh,
Scribbledydo Scrabbledy. Oh no.

06:55.887 --> 06:58.879
Na cana, sharacota.

07:00.091 --> 07:02.082
C'mon, Orko. They're headed this way.

07:03.128 --> 07:07.292
Scrabbledee doo, Sickledee shin.
I mean, Shabblethis magic

07:07.632 --> 07:08.632
Wait, that's it.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.701
Scrabbledee magic, scribbledeedeer,

07:11.002 --> 07:12.833
and now by this magic, words be clear.

07:13.104 --> 07:14.628
Shara tomma.

07:16.775 --> 07:19.767
Ah. You do serve, the Ghost Face.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.612
Galloping galaxies. I - I did it!

07:22.914 --> 07:27.248
He-Man, she said Ghost Face.
She must mean Skeletor?

07:27.552 --> 07:29.918
We are friends, we want to help you.

07:30.588 --> 07:32.749
You've got to believe me, we...

07:35.927 --> 07:37.224
Dragosaur.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.594
My blaster won't work.

07:44.469 --> 07:45.595
Look out, He-Man!

08:01.853 --> 08:04.321
We're lucky that wind came along.

08:04.589 --> 08:06.989
Not luck, Man-At-Arms. My magic.

08:10.128 --> 08:13.222
I don't know why,
but my magic seems stronger here.

08:13.498 --> 08:15.156
It's not that it wasn't always great...

08:15.367 --> 08:16.800
Help...

08:23.942 --> 08:24.942
Let's move it.

08:30.115 --> 08:31.776
Missed, Dragonbreath?

08:33.518 --> 08:35.315
Have you out in a minute folks.

08:41.926 --> 08:42.926
C'mon.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.131
He-Man, the pit's clear.

08:56.341 --> 08:57.865
Back, Battle Cat.

09:02.414 --> 09:06.111
Okay, you big bully. Come and get us.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.260
That should hold worm-face
for a little bit.

09:27.921 --> 09:31.152
You have proved yourself
friends to the Snake Clan,

09:31.176 --> 09:34.145
He-Man. How may we help you?

09:34.446 --> 09:36.539
Tell us everything you know about Skeletor,

09:36.815 --> 09:38.544
the one you call 'Ghost Face'.

09:39.084 --> 09:42.076
He came to our land, a short while ago.

09:42.487 --> 09:47.083
And with his evil power, took
control of Ollo, Master of the Ape Clan.

09:47.492 --> 09:49.653
Once, The Ape Men were our friends.

09:50.095 --> 09:53.064
Now they hunt us, trapping our people...

09:53.331 --> 09:57.097
and forcing them to work as slaves
in the fortress of the Ghost Face.

09:57.602 --> 09:59.570
Can you lead us to this fortress?

09:59.904 --> 10:00.904
Ah.

10:01.005 --> 10:03.235
I don't wish to see you destroyed.

10:03.541 --> 10:05.443
Don't worry, we'll be careful.

10:05.443 --> 10:07.411
And we do have surprise on our side.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.576
That's what you think, He-Man.

10:09.981 --> 10:11.710
Ollo, gather your warriors.

10:12.016 --> 10:15.213
We'll show He-Man a little
surprise of our own.

10:16.821 --> 10:19.289
At once, Skeletor.

10:24.963 --> 10:26.590
It's too quiet.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.430
Then let's make a little noise.

10:33.171 --> 10:34.638
Give up, Skeletor,

10:35.006 --> 10:37.736
or we'll turn your
fortress into toothpicks.

10:39.544 --> 10:42.104
Let's see you try it, fool.

10:43.281 --> 10:44.714
Let's get him.

10:44.983 --> 10:47.315
For Eternia and Grayskull.

10:52.790 --> 10:53.790
Stop them.

11:00.031 --> 11:01.031
Fire.

11:20.618 --> 11:23.052
Mind if we drop in, Skeletor?

11:24.556 --> 11:26.990
Ape Men, get them.

11:28.726 --> 11:31.354
That club would make a fine toothpick.

11:38.703 --> 11:40.864
That should cool him off.

11:56.754 --> 11:59.746
And now for you, Ghost Face.

12:03.027 --> 12:05.427
Not so fast, my pretty.

12:05.730 --> 12:07.857
Have a little sleeping gas.

12:10.735 --> 12:12.862
He-Man, they got Zilora.

12:15.807 --> 12:17.434
Skeletor, stop!

12:17.842 --> 12:20.106
Too late, fools.

12:20.445 --> 12:24.438
Now you have a choice,
save Castle Grayskull...

12:24.749 --> 12:29.209
or try to save this woman from
Dragosaur Isle. [laughing]

12:43.601 --> 12:46.092
There it is, Dragosaur Isle.

13:04.789 --> 13:06.814
He-Man's here. Good!

13:07.025 --> 13:09.653
While he wastes his time
trying to rescue Zilora...

13:10.261 --> 13:12.923
The moment I have waited for, approaches.

13:13.231 --> 13:15.358
This time, I can't lose.

13:15.633 --> 13:18.466
But what'll we do, if he comes here?

13:18.736 --> 13:21.034
The Terrors of the Jungle
will take care of him.

13:21.306 --> 13:23.900
And if they don't, we'll do it ourselves!

13:39.992 --> 13:40.992
Help!

13:45.763 --> 13:46.957
Hang on, Orko!

14:19.997 --> 14:23.933
Phew, thanks, He-Man.
That silly weed almost had me for lunch.

14:24.302 --> 14:25.894
Let's keep alert.

14:26.104 --> 14:29.335
I'm sure thats only the first
of Skeletor's nasty tricks.

14:54.165 --> 14:57.293
I guess that'll teach
Skeletor, not to bug us.

15:08.045 --> 15:11.640
So He-Man and his friends have survived.

15:12.150 --> 15:13.583
Welcome, He-Man.

15:21.259 --> 15:22.783
Fang Man, attack!

15:23.361 --> 15:25.090
Get them, my beauties.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.029
We've got company, He-Man.

15:34.906 --> 15:37.431
Those big lizards could use a little rest.

15:43.848 --> 15:45.440
My beauties!

15:45.750 --> 15:47.843
You'll all pay for this.

15:51.889 --> 15:54.915
Here's something for your
beauty to chew on, Fang Man.

16:07.138 --> 16:08.765
Hold it, Skeletor.

16:13.177 --> 16:14.906
You're too late.

16:15.079 --> 16:19.709
This spell will trap her
forever between time and space.

16:20.885 --> 16:25.618
Help me, He-Man.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.920
I'm coming.

16:30.161 --> 16:31.161
Stay back.

16:31.162 --> 16:33.960
This cage is alive with Skeletor's magic.

16:34.866 --> 16:36.128
Help.

16:44.775 --> 16:47.369
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

16:48.045 --> 16:49.045
Good work.

16:49.213 --> 16:52.114
Not good enough. Skeletor got away.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.883
He-Man, listen.

16:54.218 --> 16:57.119
The window of time will soon draw you back.

16:57.388 --> 17:00.585
You have only a little
while to stop Skeletor.

17:01.058 --> 17:02.821
Sorceress, can you help us?

17:03.127 --> 17:04.458
I shall do what I can.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.171
Oh, not again.

17:17.474 --> 17:19.271
Skeletor!

17:21.646 --> 17:23.079
Agh, get them.

17:23.513 --> 17:26.210
Hold them off, I'll stop Skeletor.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.885
I thought my blasters might work again.

17:37.728 --> 17:39.628
The moment has come.

17:42.366 --> 17:43.663
Skeletor.

17:44.702 --> 17:47.865
He-Man, you won't stop me now.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.332
You've had it, Skull Face.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.508
I'll show you power.

17:55.746 --> 17:57.236
You want power, Skeletor?

17:57.615 --> 17:58.615
Fool.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.078
Try this!

18:02.887 --> 18:07.688
At last I won, the wheel spins!

18:11.495 --> 18:12.495
I...

18:12.563 --> 18:13.563
I can't...

18:13.798 --> 18:14.798
stop it.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.462
No one can stop it.

18:18.769 --> 18:23.229
It will spin throughout
time, moving faster...

18:23.574 --> 18:26.634
growing larger until
in years to come it...

18:26.844 --> 18:30.780
explode, destroying
Castle Grayskull forever.

18:31.315 --> 18:35.149
Maybe I can't stop it,
but I bet I can speed it up.

18:35.419 --> 18:36.419
No!

18:39.724 --> 18:40.850
Stop!

18:53.871 --> 18:58.205
Fool! You've broken loose the Time Wheel.
It will explode!

18:58.442 --> 19:01.969
You may have saved Grayskull,
but you've doomed yourself!

19:12.023 --> 19:14.685
No time to think my way
out, only one thing to do.

19:22.566 --> 19:25.660
Jumping Jupiter, what was that?

19:26.971 --> 19:29.804
That's what Skeletor had
planned for Grayskull.

19:30.508 --> 19:32.942
He just forgot to plan on He-Man.

19:45.322 --> 19:48.951
Welcome back, He-Man.
You did well. All of you.

19:49.260 --> 19:51.820
What happened to Zilora? I liked her.

19:52.430 --> 19:55.490
All I can say is that
through your efforts...

19:55.833 --> 19:59.166
the Snake Clan and the Ape
Clan will be friends again.

19:59.403 --> 20:03.362
And together they'll build the
world that is our Eternia.

20:03.641 --> 20:06.735
You have the thanks of
Castle Grayskull, He-Man.

20:07.978 --> 20:10.947
And now, I must make
sure that Skeletor's...

20:11.182 --> 20:13.912
time corridor is closed forever.

20:14.485 --> 20:15.543
Farewell.

20:21.726 --> 20:24.422
Now thats what I call real magic.

20:29.934 --> 20:32.425
As we've just seen,
Skeletor went back into the past...

20:32.703 --> 20:34.671
to make evil things happen.

20:35.039 --> 20:37.064
In reality,
no one can go back into the past,

20:37.341 --> 20:38.774
that's only make-believe.

20:39.110 --> 20:40.805
But we can try to learn from the past...

20:41.078 --> 20:43.638
from things that have happened to
us and try to...

20:43.948 --> 20:45.848
apply them toward being
better people today.

20:46.217 --> 20:48.276
Remember, it's today that counts.

20:48.586 --> 20:50.952
So make it the best day possible.

20:51.255 --> 20:52.581
Until next time this is He-Man,

20:52.623 --> 20:55.820
wishing you good health and good luck.
