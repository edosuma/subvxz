<i>NARRATOR".
When we last saw the Boy Wonder...</i>

00:12.847 --> 00:16.100
...he <i>was about to be printed
into</i> a <i>horrible human comic book...</i>

00:16.309 --> 00:19.521
<i>...and Bruce Wayne was being
forced to push the switch...</i>

00:19.729 --> 00:22.815
<i>...that would stamp Robin's doom.</i>

00:23.274 --> 00:24.651
<i>What way out?</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:28.863
<i>Frankly, this observer fears there's none.</i>

<i>NARRATOR". But on the street below
the doomful scene, trusty Alfred...</i>

01:44.856 --> 01:47.025
<i>...per a Batman plan.</i>

01:47.233 --> 01:52.071
Master Robin, Mr. Wayne, sir,
do you read me?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.490
Do you read me, sir?

01:58.286 --> 02:00.121
Oh, dear.

02:05.585 --> 02:07.879
Bless my vertigo.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.923
Quick, my humorous robots,
exert yourselves.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.760
Conclude this comical charade.

02:23.603 --> 02:25.480
Sorry, Boy Wonder...

02:25.688 --> 02:27.940
...I'm doing my very best against this...

02:28.149 --> 02:34.322
...infernal robot super-strength.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.616
Mr. Wayne, I know you're doing your best.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.667
- What the devil?
-it's Batman.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.879
Unhand Mr. Wayne.
Here comes the Batgas.

02:54.384 --> 02:57.887
Robots, now hear this:
We who laugh and run away...

02:58.096 --> 03:00.765
...live to laugh another day.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.793
- Quickly, Alfred, the Batfan.
- Very good, sir.

03:36.509 --> 03:39.679
- Well done, Alfred, and bravely too.
-Ha, ha.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.390
You were great, Alfred.
You even sounded like Batman.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.434
Small wonder, Master Robin.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.937
That was my own voice, Robin.
Remember those lessons in ventriloquism?

03:48.146 --> 03:50.189
Gosh, yes. I should have thought of that.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.899
No, don't blame yourself, Robin.

03:52.108 --> 03:56.487
It's sometimes difficult to think clearly
when you're strapped to a printing press.

03:56.696 --> 04:01.075
Joker and his bad luck gang escaped
down that secret elevator.

04:01.284 --> 04:05.788
Who cares? Now we've got proof that Joker
was back of that counterfeit operation.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.999
"Was" is right, Robin.

04:08.207 --> 04:11.252
I'm afraid all we've succeeded
in doing here is frightening him...

04:11.461 --> 04:15.047
...into another criminal endeavor.
-Any notion what that might be, sir?

04:15.965 --> 04:19.719
No, but I have an ugly hunch, Alfred.

04:19.886 --> 04:24.390
As part of my charade, I prepared a document
appointing Joker as an officer of Gotham Bank.

04:24.599 --> 04:28.060
Unfortunately, in the ensuing melee...

04:28.269 --> 04:31.230
...he snatched the document
and made off with it.

04:31.439 --> 04:35.359
- Holy bankruptcy. You don't mean--?
-Alas I do, Robin.

04:35.568 --> 04:40.198
Under the alias of W.C. Whiteface...

04:40.406 --> 04:43.618
...Joker is now the legal vice chairman...

04:43.826 --> 04:47.622
...of the board of the Gotham National Bank.

04:56.589 --> 04:59.175
Look, he's got his criminal robots
installed as tellers.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.135
Ominous indeed.

05:01.344 --> 05:04.764
Bruce Wayne is chairman of the board
of this bank. Can he fire them?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.225
Regrettably not, Robin.

05:07.433 --> 05:12.355
Vice chairman has complete control
of personnel according to the charter...

05:12.563 --> 05:16.359
...however we could not anticipate
such a pass as this.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.571
Well now, it's Batman and Robin.

05:20.780 --> 05:23.533
- Good afternoon, Batman.
-Good afternoon.

05:23.741 --> 05:29.372
And what can I do for you?
Perhaps a small Batcave improvement loan?

05:30.081 --> 05:31.958
No, thank you.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.002
We're here in search of criminal activity.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.379
Ooh! Ha-ha-ha!

05:36.546 --> 05:38.422
That's priceless, priceless.

05:38.631 --> 05:42.426
Oh, the blind blundering bats
are getting funnier and funnier.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.648
Anything amiss, Mr. Flamm?

05:55.857 --> 06:00.736
Nothing, Batman. Mr. Whiteface
has this branch in apple pie order.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.740
Holy stomachache, some sour apple pie.

06:05.449 --> 06:09.453
Are you aware that your new tellers
are actually a pair of robots?

06:09.662 --> 06:12.290
Oh, well, yes, I did suspect that...

06:12.498 --> 06:16.544
...but our customers find them
positively charming...

06:16.752 --> 06:21.048
...and our mid-day audit
was correct to the penny.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.594
Come on, Robin.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.641
That twisted mocking fiend.
What's he up to?

06:30.850 --> 06:34.562
All too obvious, he's playing honest
to set the stage for a criminal coup...

06:34.770 --> 06:37.732
...that will stagger our imaginations.
-Sure, Batman, but what?

06:37.940 --> 06:40.651
That's a good question, Robin, I wish...

06:40.860 --> 06:44.655
Wait a minute, here he comes
with that deluded moll of his.

06:44.822 --> 06:49.911
If we play our cards right,
perhaps we can cull a clue.

06:50.786 --> 06:54.081
Hello there, Mr. Pasty Whiteface,
going somewhere?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.334
Ho, oh! Don't they wish they knew.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.461
We'd better follow them, Robin.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.423
From the look on his face,
they're off to rob a church poor box.

07:02.632 --> 07:05.843
Why, you impertinent flying rodent...

07:06.052 --> 07:08.387
...Miss Miller and I are off
to see my associate...

07:08.596 --> 07:12.516
...millionaire Bruce Wayne,
on a most important matter. Ha!

07:19.899 --> 07:21.442
Well, well.

07:21.651 --> 07:26.072
It looks like we're getting closer to the heart
of this criminal artichoke.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.366
- We could run him in, Batman.
-What?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.034
Look at that crazy Joke-mobile.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.331
I bet it violates 50 sections
of the Gotham State Vehicle Safety Code.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.709
Don't be foolish, Robin.
Far better that we eavesdrop...

07:38.918 --> 07:42.338
...on his unscheduled meeting
with millionaire Bruce Wayne.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.551
Let's go, Robin, no use hounding
these innocent citizens.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.222
Let's take the Batmobile in
for a safety check, shall we?

07:51.430 --> 07:54.850
You're right, Batman, it's long overdue.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.437
Good afternoon, sir.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.063
I hope it will be, Alfred.
We're expecting callers.

08:42.273 --> 08:46.444
When they arrive, show no emotion,
but usher them in.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.164
The next voice
you hear will be your own, Mr. Wayne.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.666
Ha, ha. Remember?

09:00.875 --> 09:02.293
<i>But,</i> you see...

09:02.460 --> 09:06.589
<i>...I foolishly succumbed
to the temptation of speculation...</i>

09:06.797 --> 09:10.968
<i>...with the funds of the Wayne Foundation.
The results were catastrophic.</i>

09:11.719 --> 09:15.848
<i>Tomorrow is the annual accounting
and if I don't have...</i>

09:16.057 --> 09:18.476
- Stop at once.
-Ho-ho-ho.

09:19.018 --> 09:21.395
Gosh, Bruce, how could you?

09:21.604 --> 09:25.441
Temptation, Dick.
A sudden drop in the stock market...

09:25.649 --> 09:28.069
...a search for an easy way.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.697
It's ruined stronger men than myself.

09:31.906 --> 09:35.534
So, Mr. Whiteface, what's the point
of your gloomy reprise?

09:35.743 --> 09:38.162
Blackmail, Mr. Wayne.

09:38.329 --> 09:43.084
You ungrateful devil. Isn't it enough that Bruce
appointed you vice chairman of the bank?

09:43.292 --> 09:48.631
Don't dip your oar in this sordid sea, Dick.
You might get besmirched.

09:48.839 --> 09:53.260
All right, it just burns me up.
The filthy greed of some people.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.137
As you were saying, Mr. Whiteface?

09:55.346 --> 09:59.975
Imagine my ghastly situation, Mr. Wayne.
Legally installed in the bank...

10:00.184 --> 10:04.980
...but watched like an insect
by that infernal Caped Crusader.

10:05.189 --> 10:09.235
If I misappropriate a dime,
the Bat will pounce.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.530
Yes, I can understand for someone
of your dubious character...

10:12.738 --> 10:14.532
...that might prove annoying.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.618
Yes, my demands, Mr. Wayne:

10:17.827 --> 10:22.665
Unless you want that taped confession
sent to the authorities...

10:22.873 --> 10:26.043
...you will lure
the Dynamic Duo into a trap...

10:26.252 --> 10:31.715
...deliver me the lifeless corpse
of Batman and the Boy Wonder.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.843
That is impossible.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.638
Bruce Wayne may be a crooked embezzler,
but he's not a killer.

10:37.847 --> 10:41.851
- Right, Bruce?
-You phrase it well, Dick.

10:42.810 --> 10:47.606
Since the murder of my parents
by dastardly criminals...

10:47.815 --> 10:50.442
...violence has been anathema to me.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.196
We've been foiled, Joker.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.657
- That guy's a milksop.
-Uh-huh.

10:56.866 --> 11:02.788
Very well then, we must be content
with our humorous alternate plan B.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.748
- Plan B?
-Plan B?

11:07.293 --> 11:12.047
Oh, Brucie pie, yes, yes, yes!

11:14.550 --> 11:15.593
I beg your pardon?

11:15.801 --> 11:18.721
Oh, you're a lucky chap, Mr. Wayne.
Ha-ha-ha!

11:18.929 --> 11:23.267
My pretty protégé, Miss Miller,
has just consented to marry you.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.772
I'll be faithful forever in my fashion.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.985
I'll love you until the oceans
are hung up and dried.

11:33.194 --> 11:37.114
Oh, and by the way,
here is the marriage contract.

11:37.323 --> 11:40.326
Oh, let me commend you
on your generosity.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.704
The initial settlement is 3 million dollars.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.551
Hello, society editor?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.304
This is Mr. Whiteface
of the Gotham National Bank.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.056
Yeah.

12:02.473 --> 12:06.018
I have an announcement
which might be of interest.

12:06.227 --> 12:10.439
Oh, darling, you're yummy.

12:13.025 --> 12:17.696
Read all about it. Millionaire Bruce Wayne
to wed reformed gun moll.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.615
Banker's pretty protégé.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.701
Extra, extra, read all about it.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.411
Monstrous.

12:24.620 --> 12:28.582
- This alliance all but beggars belief.
-Saints preserve us.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.086
And the bride has a record longer
than both my arms and both my legs...

12:32.294 --> 12:34.338
...stitched end to end.

12:41.387 --> 12:42.638
What's on your mind?

12:42.846 --> 12:46.100
Batman, have you read
the dire news about Bruce Wayne?

12:46.725 --> 12:49.561
Love is blind, commissioner.
Bruce Wayne is over 21.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.314
I fear there is nothing we can do.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.990
She's a fetching creature, Robin.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.910
Bruce might find it
not without certain pleasures.

13:05.119 --> 13:07.162
Holy madness, Batman, I don't dig this.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.832
Bruce Wayne didn't embezzle,
that was just a ploy.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.960
Joker's blackmail threat
isn't worth a tinker's darn.

13:13.168 --> 13:16.005
Yes and no, Robin.
The way I set the caper up...

13:16.213 --> 13:19.383
...I'm afraid I couldn't explain that tape...

13:19.591 --> 13:23.053
...without compromising
our secret true identities.

13:23.262 --> 13:26.473
Gosh, yes. Ouch, I hadn't thought of that.

13:26.682 --> 13:31.520
Luckily for us, however,
there's one weak link in this criminal chain.

13:31.729 --> 13:34.356
- Where?
-Think, Robin, think.

13:34.565 --> 13:38.068
Rehearse this curious affair
from the very beginning.

13:38.277 --> 13:44.366
You should see one gigantic foothold
which we haven't even laid a hand on.

13:44.575 --> 13:47.578
A foothold we haven't laid a hand on?

13:47.786 --> 13:50.956
- Gosh, you have me buffaloed, Batman.
<i>- I'll</i> give you a hint, Robin.

13:51.165 --> 13:56.587
Our secret weapon is a dead stranger
in this Batcave.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.381
Dead stranger in this...

14:00.841 --> 14:05.012
- Holy remote-control robot.
-Exactly, Robin.

14:05.220 --> 14:09.475
Joker's Mr. Glee, whom we captured
earlier in this adventure.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.728
If we could just solve the secret
of his control mechanism...

14:12.936 --> 14:16.273
...we'd have the other two robots
dancing in our control.

14:19.485 --> 14:22.988
<i>NARRATOR". Watch out, Bruce Wayne,
for as the Caped Crusaders toil...</i>

14:23.155 --> 14:26.909
<i>...a strange meeting takes place
in Commissioner Gordon's office.</i>

14:27.117 --> 14:29.203
- Well, Dr. Floyd?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:29.370 --> 14:34.583
It's no doubt, from the symptoms
you describe me...

14:34.750 --> 14:41.382
"Bruce Wayne is victim from the well-known
second childhood syndrome.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.927
Sufficiently so to commit him
to some mental institution?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.887
Yeah, yeah, yeah, naturally.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.014
One other vital point, doctor.

14:49.223 --> 14:52.559
How long would you say Mr. Wayne
has suffered from this condition?

14:52.768 --> 14:57.064
Well, uh, the incubation period is slow.

14:57.272 --> 15:02.194
Perhaps three months,
surely not less than two.

15:02.403 --> 15:05.948
- Saints be praised.
-Yes, Chief O'Hara, we're free to act.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.952
Wayne was definitely mentally incompetent
when he appointed the Joker to his bank.

15:10.119 --> 15:12.746
So, uh, what do we do?

15:12.955 --> 15:14.081
We have no choice.

15:14.289 --> 15:18.627
The poor fellow's irrational behavior threatens
the entire financial structure of Gotham City.

15:18.836 --> 15:19.962
- Chief O'Hara?
-Yes, sir.

15:20.129 --> 15:21.713
Alert your Anti-lunatic Squad.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.049
If Batman won't help us,
we'll do it ourselves.

15:24.258 --> 15:27.511
Bring in millionaire Bruce Wayne
in a straitjacket.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.471
Yes, sir.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.484
Well, I think we have
his wavelengths analyzed.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.611
Shall we give it a spin?

15:44.820 --> 15:47.197
- Ready, Robin?
-Ready.

15:51.076 --> 15:57.291
Mr. Glee, in the name of justice,
I summon you back to life.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.711
Rise, please.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.175
Holy Frankenstein, we've done it.

16:07.217 --> 16:11.221
Now the fun begins, Robin. With Joker's
nasty robots at our command, we'll--

16:12.556 --> 16:14.099
- Alfred here.
- Yes, Alfred?

16:14.308 --> 16:15.851
<i>It's Chief O'Hara, sir.</i>

16:16.059 --> 16:19.688
He wishes to see Mr. Wayne
on a matter of urgency.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.399
Tell him to wait, Alfred.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.028
I'll be right back, Robin.
Meanwhile, here's the plan.

16:34.203 --> 16:37.372
- Hello, chief.
-Wrap him up, boys.

16:39.791 --> 16:43.212
- Chief O'Hara, what's the meaning of this?
-it's a court order, Mr. Wayne.

16:43.420 --> 16:48.008
Don't worry, you'll have a nice long rest
in Happy Acres. Come on, boys.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.845
I'm a personal friend
of Commissioner Gordon!

16:59.686 --> 17:02.481
What? Bruce taken off in a straitjacket?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.733
I observed it myself, Master Robin.

17:04.942 --> 17:08.069
Holy stewpot, and I've just
transmitted Batman's orders...

17:08.278 --> 17:11.365
...to those robots at the bank.
-indeed.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.952
- This blow does seem ill-timed.
-We haven't a minute to lose.

17:15.160 --> 17:19.665
- Quick, Alfred, put on your trusty Batman suit.
-Roger.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.617
I believe that's them ahead, Master Robin.

17:58.453 --> 18:03.375
It's them, all right. First I'll give that wagon
a little touch of Batray.

18:07.421 --> 18:10.048
- Good shot, Master Robin.
-Thanks, Alfred.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.551
Now for the super-powered Batmagnet.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.430
With any luck, we'll latch onto
the metal buckles of that straitjacket.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.316
- Good thinking.
-Are you okay?

18:27.482 --> 18:31.320
Yes, I rolled with the fall. Now get me out
of this overly tailored jacket.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.245
- Your spare Batsuit, sir.
-Thank you, Alfred.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.414
I'll be back in a moment.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.759
Quickly, Robin, to the Batmobile.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.355
The medical findings,
my dear Mr. Whiteface.

19:06.563 --> 19:10.859
Bruce Wayne was not of sound mind
when he appointed you to this position.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.529
- Vacate these premises at once.
-Fraud, frame-up!

19:14.738 --> 19:19.326
Joker, never mind,
we've still got me and Brucie.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.497
Hey-

19:23.705 --> 19:27.376
My dear wife, Josephine,
I've been looking for you everywhere.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.338
So that's your game,
aiding and abetting attempted bigamy.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.508
Holy wedding cake,
wait till we tell Bruce Wayne.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.928
- You creep, I'm not your wife.
-What?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.430
Have you forgotten our honeymoon
at Niagara Falls?

19:40.639 --> 19:43.600
Oh, boy, he's following
our secret orders perfectly.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.728
Why, you mechanical moron,
what's gotten into you?

19:46.937 --> 19:48.105
Help, stick-up!

19:48.313 --> 19:51.108
Empty your purse, madam.
Hand me the contents.

19:51.316 --> 19:54.069
Your wallet, sir,
or a bullet between your eyes.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.322
What is this madness? Am I dreaming?

19:57.531 --> 20:01.868
Joker, our robots must be getting orders
from someplace else.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.913
- Ooh.
-Don't look at us, Joker.

20:05.122 --> 20:08.875
We just dropped in for that small Batcave
improvement loan that you mentioned...

20:09.084 --> 20:13.171
...but in view of the strange criminal activity
that seems to be transpiring here...

20:13.380 --> 20:16.425
- Let's rack them up, Batman.
-Good idea, Robin.

20:17.384 --> 20:23.598
Robots, Boff and Yock and Glee,
reprogram, ignore all previous instructions.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.435
Get the Dynamic Duo.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.105
Wow, we're double-crossed.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.691
That's the trouble with robots, Robin.

20:32.858 --> 20:36.194
They lack even the most minimal
sense of loyalty.

20:36.403 --> 20:40.157
Now let's conclude this ugly
little charade, shall we, Robin?

20:56.548 --> 20:58.300
Get them.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.966
Ugh. Where am I?

21:42.803 --> 21:47.057
You're about to start a journey you should
know well by now, Joker: up the river.

21:47.265 --> 21:50.227
Here's the biggest joke.
It was all a bluff, Joker.

21:50.435 --> 21:54.564
We didn't have one darn thing on you until
you ordered those robots to try to kill us.

21:54.773 --> 21:59.152
Fantastic, Boy Wonder,
what incredible brain work.

22:11.498 --> 22:16.253
Batman, if ever you
see Bruce Wayne, tell him...

22:16.837 --> 22:19.756
Tell him it might have been fun.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.973
I'll tell him.

22:35.564 --> 22:38.441
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.736
Ah, stand clear, everyone.

23:02.424 --> 23:07.220
I declare Herr Wayne's
mental recovery is complete.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.930
Capital.

23:09.097 --> 23:13.226
Uh, without doubt, the bump on the head...

23:13.435 --> 23:16.897
...when he accidentally
fell from the paddy wagon...

23:17.105 --> 23:21.860
...restored him among us sane peoples.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.071
- Thank you very much, doctor.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:25.280 --> 23:30.285
If only I could make a similar
examination of the head...

23:30.493 --> 23:33.246
<i>...from the Fledermaus Mensch.</i>

23:33.455 --> 23:36.917
- The what?
-The <i>Fledermaus Mensch.</i>

23:37.626 --> 23:39.669
How's your German, Dick?

23:39.836 --> 23:41.671
<i>Fledermaus Mensch.</i>

23:41.838 --> 23:45.675
- Why, that's German for Batman.
-Right you are, old chum.

23:45.884 --> 23:50.180
<i>What wonders</i> there <i>must be
in the Fledermaus Mensch 's</i> head.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.640
Oh, I don't know.

23:51.848 --> 23:58.104
Oh, come now, Bruce, don't joke.
The brain of Batman, oh, miraculous.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.316
I'll make you a bet, doctor.

24:01.524 --> 24:05.946
If you were to have the opportunity
to study Batman's brain...

24:06.154 --> 24:09.616
...with all its myriad flaws...

24:09.824 --> 24:13.912
...I think you'd find it
not terribly unlike my own.

24:14.412 --> 24:19.876
Mother of mercy, get the smelling salts.
Mr. Wayne is having a relapse.
