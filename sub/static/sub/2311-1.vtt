00:44.503 --> 00:46.050
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:29.506 --> 01:32.760
<i>He's a French dealer
selling a case of liquid heroin.</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:38.850
<i>Ben, grab the drugs.
Bobby's at the money.</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:41.936
<i>Me and Marshall will cover you
fill you get back to the car.</i>

01:41.977 --> 01:43.604
<i>Then we get
the fuck out.</i>

01:43.687 --> 01:45.860
So my plan, basically.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.941
You came to me,
remember?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.907
<i>That's him.</i>

03:35.090 --> 03:37.639
Bobby.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.970
Sorry, mate.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.779
<i>Bobby.</i>

03:59.364 --> 04:00.991
Bobby.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.578
Fuck.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.417
Bobby.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.837
<i>Jack. Bobby.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:15.138
<i>Bobby is gone, Jack.
We need to leave now.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.591
<i>Come on.
Come on, now.</i>

04:58.298 --> 04:59.800
Hi.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.395
Hi, sweetie pie.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.394
<i>How's my beautiful godson?</i>

05:06.473 --> 05:08.976
<i>Yes.</i>

05:09.059 --> 05:10.982
Come here.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.905
Hi, sweet pie.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.233
I missed you.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.660
You're late. Now I'm
going to be late.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.661
<i>Nice to see you, too.</i>

05:20.695 --> 05:23.824
Someone has been crying his
little head off all morning.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.500
The bloody
washing machine's broken.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.669
I'm having to wash
everything in the sink.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.748
<i>Speaking of which... Don't
push your luck, Mommy.</i>

05:30.831 --> 05:35.428
Godmothers babysit, we buy
presents, we don't do laundry.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.675
Someone's very grumpy.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.589
You got your period?
No.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.722
It's sushi night,
actually.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.099
<i>You're not still doing
that, are you? Yeah.</i>

05:45.178 --> 05:47.055
You might as well wear
a T-shirt saying,

05:47.138 --> 05:49.607
"Hi, I'm ovulating.
Do you want to fuck?"

05:49.683 --> 05:54.063
<i>What's the romance in that'? Darling,
you do know, if! had the money, I'd...</i>

05:54.145 --> 05:56.614
Well, actually, I'd first go
buy a new washing machine,

05:56.690 --> 06:00.035
but then after that I'd pay
for you to go private.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.241
<i>I'd IVF you a baby.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:07.459
How's Tom?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.128
He's just spending every
waking minute at the house.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.628
You're so lucky
to have him.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.802
And you're so lucky
to have him.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.590
<i>Tom. Tom.</i>

06:22.883 --> 06:24.351
You up there?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.098
What you doing?
Didn't you hear me?

06:32.183 --> 06:33.981
Job I just finished
had a little extra.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.937
<i>Thought you
could use them.</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:40.442
You all right, mate?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.153
I think we're going to lose the house.
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

06:43.236 --> 06:46.331
I thought you were coming along.
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:49.501
Not far enough.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.455
Pumped all
the money into it.

06:52.537 --> 06:56.087
Half my budget went into
this fucking dry rot.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.676
What does Anna say?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.928
I haven't told her, yet.

07:03.965 --> 07:08.015
She only knows half of what I spent
and she's already freaking out.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.519
We're trying to start a family. Can't
even afford the rent on our apartment.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.522
Just talk to her, mate.
She'll understand.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.613
Come on.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.863
If you're up for it, a friend of mine
needs some painting done next week.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.156
Won't pay much, but...

07:27.238 --> 07:31.209
Yeah.
Thanks.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.209
It's a good thing I have a Master's degree.
Come in handy.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.790
See you, bud.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.809
Tom Wright?
Yeah.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.651
You're served.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.115
We've got two weeks?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.028
Thanks.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.759
Ben.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.053
Turn it down.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.394
<i>Hello?</i>

08:42.938 --> 08:46.193
Hi.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.574
It's, uh, sushi night?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.455
<i>You forgot.</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:56.753
No. No.

08:56.828 --> 09:00.378
I never forget sushi night.
It's fine.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.880
Nice wine.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.633
<i>It was just
a few quid extra.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:08.886
A very nice wine. <i>And I
thought it was worth it.</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:13.971
Of course
it's worth it.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.733
Come here.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.360
Sushi night.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.321
How's Julian?

09:24.397 --> 09:28.402
He's... loud and...

09:29.986 --> 09:31.579
Tonight,
Yeah?

09:31.613 --> 09:33.615
Someone's going
to get pregnant.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.943
Hey.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.909
You Okay?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.624
We're going to lose
the house.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.794
No.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.962
No. We're going to work it out.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.891
<i>Mike just got me
a few days on a good job.</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:39.431
Maybe it's time we go back. No.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.650
No.
Tom.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.773
This was my idea.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.816
I promised you
a fresh start.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.824
I promised you a place
to start a family.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.578
That was then.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.416
I'm not giving up.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.999
So... you can shut up.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.839
Tonight is sushi night.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.505
I'm feeling lucky.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.767
<i>Ben.</i>

11:33.735 --> 11:35.362
Ben.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.095
No answer.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.305
Tom.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.557
Ben?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.854
I'm coming down.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.827
Ben.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.255
Ben?

12:31.334 --> 12:33.052
<i>Oh, Tom.</i>

12:43.096 --> 12:44.564
Oh, my God.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.222
I can't believe he was
down here the whole time.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.479
<i>Yeah. Right below
where our bedroom is.</i>

13:52.999 --> 13:55.377
Anna.
What?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.034
<i>Oh, my God, Tom.</i>

14:20.109 --> 14:23.113
220,000 pounds.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.949
What the hell was Ben doing
with this much cash?

14:26.032 --> 14:29.536
What was he doing living in our
basement with all this cash?

14:30.912 --> 14:34.587
Well, he was
on disability,

14:34.665 --> 14:38.420
and maybe he had a big
settlement after an accident?

14:38.503 --> 14:42.474
I just don't know why it
wouldn't be in the bank.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.042
So, what do we do?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.164
Hm?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.007
We call the police.
Yeah?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.773
Anna. Anna.
What?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.943
<i>Wait.</i>

15:35.017 --> 15:36.485
Tom.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.442
Help me. We shouldn't have
brought this up here.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.276
I know.
You want to help me?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.702
Tom.
Help me now.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.625
I got it.
Answer the door.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.624
Mr. Wright?
Yes.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.341
I'm Detective Inspector
John Haiden.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.184
So, Mr. Wright,
what-what is it you do?

16:08.259 --> 16:11.684
<i>He's a landscape architect.
Oh.</i>

16:11.762 --> 16:15.983
Yeah. I used to be, in Chicago.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.312
I had a small business,
a little crew,

16:19.395 --> 16:21.318
but it fell apart
in the crash,

16:21.397 --> 16:24.742
so we moved here
for a fresh start.

16:24.817 --> 16:29.414
We also had an unfortunate
miscarriage a few years ago, so...

16:29.489 --> 16:31.662
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So sorry.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.043
<i>It was a nice
change for us.</i>

16:34.118 --> 16:37.167
<i>So, now I-I do
contracting work</i>

16:37.246 --> 16:39.920
odd jobs
and manual labor.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.252
<i>Why London? Tom's
renovating</i> a <i>house.</i>

16:42.335 --> 16:45.430
<i>My grandmother
passed a few years ago</i>

16:45.505 --> 16:50.102
and we inherited the family house,
so I thought I'd fix it up.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.931
Good for you.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.438
So, Mrs. Wright, how are you,
um, how are you liking London?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.394
Anna, please.

16:59.477 --> 17:03.198
I'm a school teacher at
Morningside Primary school

17:03.272 --> 17:05.866
My wife runs a clinic just
down the street from there.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.913
<i>Sterling House? That's a,
uh, women's shelter, right?</i>

17:09.987 --> 17:13.958
<i>Yeah. They look after young women with
drug addiction, take them off the streets.</i>

17:14.032 --> 17:16.957
<i>The government has withdrawn its
funding, but they're hanging in there.</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:20.131
My wife, Marie,
isn't one for giving up.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.463
Anyhow...

17:27.547 --> 17:29.720
So, thank you
for the tea.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.228
<i>It was very good.</i>

17:36.305 --> 17:38.808
How long have you been
renting the room downstairs?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.314
Uh, not long.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.444
I mean, we just did it 'cause
we needed help with the rent.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.400
Three months, maybe.
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:47.483 --> 17:51.829
And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.579
No, not really, no.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.581
Did he, um,

17:57.618 --> 18:00.121
did he have
any visitors?

18:03.207 --> 18:08.964
Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.424
No. He watched a
lot of television.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.260
<i>Yeah, that's true.
Very loud.</i>

18:14.302 --> 18:18.307
Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?

18:23.853 --> 18:26.106
When you, um,

18:26.188 --> 18:29.192
when you discovered
he body, did you...

18:29.275 --> 18:31.403
Did you find
anything else?

18:34.739 --> 18:37.288
Um...
No.

18:37.325 --> 18:40.499
The reason I ask is because
the initial police report

18:40.578 --> 18:43.297
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.670
and the team downstairs are
just looking for evidence

18:45.750 --> 18:47.878
that he may
have kept drugs there.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.464
No, we had... I mean,
we had no idea.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.474
Well, it's just, uh...
it's just routine.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.351
For your own safety.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.366
<i>...late 40's</i>

19:18.449 --> 19:20.827
<i>discovered in the basement
of a flat.</i>

19:20.868 --> 19:23.212
<i>The cause of death
is as yet unknown.</i>

19:23.287 --> 19:26.712
<i>His identity is being withheld
until relatives are traced.</i>

19:26.791 --> 19:29.795
<i>To the city now, and London's
markets are still not steady.</i>

19:37.301 --> 19:39.099
<i>There's a new lead</i>

19:39.178 --> 19:42.557
to-to the guys that
gave Julie the drugs.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.527
I thought Martin
took you off that case.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.195
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:50.940 --> 19:53.068
Is it dangerous?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.164
<i>Really dangerous, then.</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:02.418
<i>Still not going
to bring her back, John.</i>

20:02.493 --> 20:05.042
So,

20:05.079 --> 20:06.581
why take the risk?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.386
It might save
someone else's daughter.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.765
We'll call Haiden
in the morning.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.015
Tom?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.023
Tom?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.846
What are you doing?

21:47.097 --> 21:49.896
<i>We spent our whole lives
being good, right?</i>

21:49.975 --> 21:54.731
And what has it gotten us?
Nothing.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.160
<i>So, maybe this money is a gift to
help us get our lives back on track.</i>

21:59.235 --> 22:01.158
Tom.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.491
We don't know where
this money comes from.

22:07.743 --> 22:12.374
This could be really,
really bad money.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.010
But what makes
money bad?

22:20.089 --> 22:23.684
Not the money.
The people make it bad.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.012
What people do with it.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.395
Now, I'm not saying
we do anything rash.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.065
All I'm saying is we
just wait and see.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.114
He's been dead a week.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.284
The cops came,
they didn't find anything.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.953
No one's come forward
looking for the money.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.406
Okay?
And if they do,

22:46.949 --> 22:49.247
this will look like
Ben hid it.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.290
I say
we just hide it

22:54.373 --> 22:57.217
and wait a week.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.144
Two weeks.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.685
All right.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.492
End of the month.
And then

23:23.068 --> 23:24.741
nobody comes,

23:27.197 --> 23:28.870
we just find it again.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.260
Haiden, where are the background
checks on the Scott case?

23:49.678 --> 23:53.933
You wouldn't be wasting time on the
Witkowski case? I told you to drop it.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.274
<i>Nobody gives a shit if Jack Witkowski
killed his twat of a brother.</i>

23:57.311 --> 24:01.282
<i>Another deficient shitsack off the
street is fine with this department.</i>

24:01.357 --> 24:05.032
The Scott background checks,
on my desk by five.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.965
And this has nothing
to do with Julie?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.178
No, no, no, no.
It's just...

24:27.257 --> 24:29.976
It's just a hunch
I want to follow up on.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.642
If I'm going to break every
law I'm here to uphold,

24:35.683 --> 24:37.401
I'd rather it was
for a good cause.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.110
Okay.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.157
It has everything
to do with my daughter.

24:51.865 --> 24:55.540
Bank accounts, Inland Revenue,
utility bills, mortgage.

24:55.619 --> 25:00.216
From now on, if Thomas or Anna
Wright sneeze, you'll know about it.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.342
But I warn you, there's
not much money to follow.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.677
No, not at the moment.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.093
Okay.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.271
You'll keep me posted?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.565
If Martin finds out,
I'll be fired.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.689
<i>Martin's a smug
little prick.</i>

25:19.768 --> 25:23.363
Superintendent Tosspot
can go fuck himself.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
<i>Detective Halden? Yes.</i>

25:44.626 --> 25:47.220
<i>Hi, this is
Tom Wright from</i> the...

25:47.254 --> 25:50.098
<i>How are you?
We were just wondering</i>

25:50.174 --> 25:54.645
<i>if you heard anything about the
next of kin for Ben Tuttle.</i>

25:54.720 --> 25:57.473
<i>No, no, no. We haven't located
any living relatives.</i>

25:58.766 --> 26:00.939
I just ask
because, uh,

26:01.018 --> 26:05.148
we wanted to know what do with his
things, his clothes and stuff.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.982
<i>No, no one's come
forward, yet.</i>

26:09.568 --> 26:11.320
Okay.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.158
And, uh, do you know,
was it officially...

26:15.240 --> 26:17.163
Yeah, overdose.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.336
Looks like
it was Liquid O.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.005
<i>What's Liquid O?
Heroin.</i>

26:22.081 --> 26:25.255
<i>I see.
Wow.</i>

26:25.334 --> 26:27.928
<i>Okay. Have a good day.</i> Bye.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.807
<i>You met my little
brother, haven't you?</i>

27:17.886 --> 27:20.810
Always tried
to let him win.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.517
Any game.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.523
Drove Mom crazy.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.821
Said Bobby would never
learn if we did that.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.196
'Course she was right.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.156
<i>Jack and Bobby.
How it came to this?</i>

27:37.197 --> 27:40.246
Mom was a fan.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.329
<i>She also had
high expectations.</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:49.088
Where's Cousin Ben?

27:54.381 --> 27:58.011
You know, when you
recommend a guy,

27:58.093 --> 28:01.438
<i>you're tying
his name to yours.</i>

28:01.513 --> 28:04.312
Did you know he was
going to fuck me?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.688
If you tell me
where I find him,

28:10.355 --> 28:12.733
maybe I'll choose
to believe you on that.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.786
Eddie, sir, could I please
trouble you for a pen?

28:38.467 --> 28:39.969
You done
the right thing.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.812
<i>But that doesn't mean I'm not
going to hold you accountable.</i>

29:31.603 --> 29:33.776
Anna.
Yeah.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.234
I spent some
of the money.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.453
What?

29:44.491 --> 29:46.960
<i>The day we found Ben,</i>

29:46.994 --> 29:50.715
<i>the landlord gave us
an eviction notice.</i>

29:50.789 --> 29:53.463
<i>I was going to tell you, but
you were in such a good mood,</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:56.470
<i>and it was sushi night.</i>

29:56.545 --> 29:59.219
And then we found
the money, and...

29:59.298 --> 30:02.177
I took just enough to keep
the roof over our heads.

30:04.219 --> 30:08.349
Look, we're in this.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.902
<i>As soon as we put the money in the oven and
we didn't take it out, we were in this.</i>

30:14.563 --> 30:17.737
If we don't start paying off the
mortgage, we're going to lose the house.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.414
How do we do this?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.163
We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.578
We use cash
where we can,

30:29.661 --> 30:32.380
and we get Mike
to write an invoice.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.504
You want to bring Mike
into this?

30:34.583 --> 30:37.757
No, it's not like that. We're
not bringing him into it.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.716
But when I do a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,

30:41.798 --> 30:43.550
and then writes
an invoice.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.261
So, if anyone asks...

30:46.345 --> 30:49.394
<i>Right, there's
a paper trail.</i>

30:49.473 --> 30:52.477
What if someone comes
looking for it, Tom?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.028
Anna.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.361
Nobody's come.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.450
Nobody's going
to come.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.623
And if they do,

31:06.698 --> 31:09.247
who's to say
Ben didn't spend it?

31:09.326 --> 31:12.580
How much
are we talking?

31:12.662 --> 31:15.131
Just enough
to stay above water.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.756
The mortgage,
credit cards.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.303
Just so
we're in the clear.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.645
There's only one problem
that I can think of.

31:35.727 --> 31:40.403
What? You are going
to be really lonely

31:40.482 --> 31:43.156
when the debt collectors
stop calling.

31:56.164 --> 32:00.260
Hi, this is Anna Wright. I'm calling
to inquire about an appointment.

32:02.838 --> 32:07.218
Yeah, for an IVF
consultation, if possible.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.396
Hello.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.009
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.971
Halden.
<i>It's Duncan.</i>

32:52.012 --> 32:54.561
Yeah, what's up?
Not much.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.893
I'm calling
'cause we got a flag.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.899
The Americans?
Yeah.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.822
You were right.
A lot of activity today.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.405
Mr. Wright made
five separate payments.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.488
<i>I've got deposits to the current
account, mortgage and credit cards.</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:11.156
Cash? Some cash. Some
money transfers.

33:11.198 --> 33:15.419
<i>He spread it out.
No single payment big enough
to raise flags at the bank.</i>

34:29.568 --> 34:30.989
Fuck.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.001
We found the Liquid O.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.335
What about the cash?

35:53.443 --> 35:56.162
<i>Mr. Wright?</i>

36:00.241 --> 36:02.243
Detective.

36:02.327 --> 36:06.173
It looks like someone came
for Ben's stuff after all.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.708
Yeah.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.510
Who do you think
would do this?

36:10.543 --> 36:13.843
Your tenant crossed
a very bad man.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.134
That man's name
is Jack Witkowski.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.439
So, who called
the police?

36:22.514 --> 36:23.811
No one.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.561
I just wanted
to talk to you.

36:27.644 --> 36:31.615
Yeah, well, why?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.784
Let's go upstairs.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.451
I'm sorry.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.783
It's not back there.
It's in my car.

36:40.865 --> 36:45.371
But I-I-I did just get an invoice
from, um, Mike Calloway.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.627
This Mike Calloway,
he's a friend of yours?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.381
He is, but I do a lot
of work with him,

36:51.418 --> 36:55.048
and he owed me
on two jobs,

36:55.088 --> 36:59.810
and we got paid upfront for
this other thing last week.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.387
If you're holding
anything back,

37:02.470 --> 37:04.564
you better tell me.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.641
I don't quite understand.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.070
<i>The dead tenant, Ben
Tuttle, drug abuse,</i>

37:10.145 --> 37:11.772
sudden activity
in your bank account,

37:11.855 --> 37:14.950
<i>and now, coincidentally,
a break-in.</i>

37:15.024 --> 37:18.119
<i>I don't want to accuse
you of anything.</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:20.617
I just want
to clarify things.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.995
<i>You're welcome.</i>

37:25.160 --> 37:26.958
Hey.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.672
Hey.
Ouch.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.501
Sorry, I
have to take this.

37:36.045 --> 37:40.095
<i>Would you do me a favor and please
don't mention the break-in to my wife?</i>

37:40.175 --> 37:43.975
She's been a little
rattled since Ben died.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.101
No, really, it's fine.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.581
Tom finally got paid on that big
job I was telling you about.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.820
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.943
Oh, no,
that's too much.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.400
Sarah, I got to go.
Okay, bye.

37:58.276 --> 38:02.531
<i>So, this Mike Calloway,
he pays you in cash?</i>

38:02.614 --> 38:06.369
Sorry, what
are you implying?

38:06.451 --> 38:08.704
I'm implying nothing.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.961
I was inquiring about the deposit,
and your husband cleared it up.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.089
So, all's good.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.146
The worst part is
behind us, right, baby?

38:36.231 --> 38:37.858
Yeah.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.153
It's all good.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.781
Yo.
Hey.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.951
Bloody hell.
What?

39:21.025 --> 39:25.246
Quality stuff.
Yeah.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.416
I thought you said you were
going to lose your house.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.621
Mike.
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:32.704 --> 39:35.799
Can I tell you something?

39:37.917 --> 39:39.510
Hang on.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.347
This is Tom Wright.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.854
Sure.
What kind of job?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.688
Okay, I'm interested.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.196
Yeah, I'll come by
with my partner.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.073
Fine, I'll come alone.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.704
Okay.
See you then.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.997
Looks like we might
have another job.

40:12.076 --> 40:16.297
<i>French guy, bought a
big house in Notting Hill.</i>

40:33.932 --> 40:35.275
Mr. Wright.
<i>Hi.</i>

40:35.350 --> 40:37.478
Please take a seat.
<i>Thanks.</i>

40:37.560 --> 40:41.155
You can call me Tom.
You're mister...

40:41.230 --> 40:43.949
You must forgive me. English
is not my first language.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.652
Okay.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.612
And you,
you're American, yes?

40:47.695 --> 40:52.542
I live here now. And you,
you just moved to the area?

40:52.617 --> 40:55.712
I'm expanding
my empire.

40:58.623 --> 41:02.378
Tell me, Mr. Wright,
are you a team player?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.009
I - l guess.

41:07.966 --> 41:12.893
Do you want to talk about
the renovations, mister...

41:12.971 --> 41:14.723
Genghis Khan.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.019
Genghis Khan?
Is that what you said?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.479
Do you know this man?

41:20.561 --> 41:23.815
Uh, Genghis Khan, yeah.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.574
I mean,
I've heard of him...

41:25.650 --> 41:28.324
He marched
all over the world.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.747
Countries were so afraid
of this man,

41:30.822 --> 41:34.668
they would lay down their arms
when they heard of his approach.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.086
Do you know what happened
when they did that?

41:39.247 --> 41:42.717
No, I don't know.
Nothing.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.886
Nothing happened.

41:44.961 --> 41:50.434
The Great Khan welcomed them
into his kingdom with open arms.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.102
But those
that resisted,

41:53.177 --> 41:55.930
felt his full fury.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.234
He burned the cities,
killed the men,

41:59.308 --> 42:02.733
raped their women,
salted their crops.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.118
Okay.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.905
Um...

42:11.988 --> 42:14.286
I'm sorry, I...

42:14.365 --> 42:16.538
I think I'm probably
not the right guy for this,

42:16.576 --> 42:19.796
so maybe you should get someone
else for the renovations, okay?

42:19.871 --> 42:23.296
<i>Recently, a group of
men stole from me.</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:26.628
<i>Where I come from,
this would not happen.</i>

42:26.711 --> 42:29.885
But I'm new here, so...

42:31.883 --> 42:34.477
It's not the product
that matters,

42:34.552 --> 42:37.055
it's a question
of honor.

42:37.138 --> 42:40.142
<i>So now
I'm burning cities,</i>

42:40.224 --> 42:42.397
I'm salting crops.

42:42.435 --> 42:45.234
And you have housed
my enemy.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.400
<i>Ben Tuttle.</i>

42:49.484 --> 42:52.408
Oh, I see.

42:52.445 --> 42:55.790
Okay, yes... Have you
heard of Jack Witkowski?

42:57.992 --> 43:00.165
<i>This man
dishonored me.</i>

43:00.244 --> 43:05.216
So, here's my question for you
and your lovely wife, Anna.

43:06.751 --> 43:10.631
<i>Are you team players?</i>

43:10.713 --> 43:13.967
What do you mean?
Whose team are you on?

43:15.843 --> 43:17.516
I'm not
on anybody's team.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.973
<i>If you're not
on anybody's team,</i>

43:20.056 --> 43:23.105
you are not
on my team.

43:23.142 --> 43:27.192
So, whose team
are you on?

43:28.731 --> 43:33.362
Detective Halden,
it's Tom Wright.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.821
I need your help.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.325
Babe, it's me.
Can you give me...

43:44.122 --> 43:45.590
Where's my money?

43:49.127 --> 43:50.674
<i>Where's my money?</i>

43:50.753 --> 43:53.131
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.306
Me and my brother's money.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.600
Are you an idiot,
you fucking cunt?

44:05.393 --> 44:07.691
And he died
getting it.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.824
So, you can understand me
wanting it back.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.069
Now, where is it?

44:15.153 --> 44:16.996
I don't know.

44:19.282 --> 44:20.875
Please.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.049
Please.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.469
Where's the money?

45:00.823 --> 45:02.541
So, that's how
you want to play.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.457
It's fine with me.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.993
<i>I didn't
want to go this far.</i>

45:41.239 --> 45:43.162
Please...

45:43.241 --> 45:45.460
Please, stop.
Please.

45:45.534 --> 45:47.332
Where's my money?

45:47.411 --> 45:49.664
<i>Please.
Where's is it?</i>

45:49.747 --> 45:51.420
Please stop.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.053
Where's my money?

46:05.054 --> 46:06.180
Fuck!

46:09.892 --> 46:12.190
Hm.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.248
Anna.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.011
Anna, no.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.884
Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.806
Tom.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.514
The police are coming.
Just stall.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.554
I'm okay.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.232
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

46:50.308 --> 46:52.356
That's enough.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.986
Get up.

46:58.024 --> 46:59.526
Up!

47:14.498 --> 47:16.842
This is what Tommy has.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.098
<i>Didn't you know? When
you find a pot of gold,</i>

47:22.173 --> 47:25.677
there's always
a monster guarding it.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.728
<i>You smell so nice.</i>

47:31.766 --> 47:33.860
Just relax.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.608
Stop.
It's downstairs.

47:36.687 --> 47:40.112
Bullshit.
I looked all over.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.569
<i>It's in the window frame.</i>

47:42.651 --> 47:45.621
I hid it
in the window frame.

48:16.352 --> 48:18.195
Tom's lying.

48:28.823 --> 48:31.702
He's afraid that if he gives you the
money, you're going to kill us.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.022
Fuck.

48:56.308 --> 48:57.901
Where's the fucking money?

49:00.312 --> 49:02.735
Promise me
you won't kill us.

49:06.527 --> 49:07.949
No.

49:09.655 --> 49:12.875
One, two...

49:15.119 --> 49:17.042
Stop pissing about.

49:17.121 --> 49:19.215
Which one?

49:19.290 --> 49:22.965
Three, four, five.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.548
This one.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.099
It's this one.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.016
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

49:38.517 --> 49:40.064
<i>We're in here.</i>

49:40.144 --> 49:41.817
<i>Downstairs.
He's downstairs.</i>

50:04.752 --> 50:07.096
<i>You're in serious trouble, Mr.
And Mrs. Wright.</i>

50:07.171 --> 50:10.596
You stole some money
and you spent it,

50:12.343 --> 50:14.391
<i>so you're going
to prison.</i>

50:17.181 --> 50:19.024
Do we need
to get a lawyer?

50:19.099 --> 50:21.227
A lawyer
won't change that.

50:21.310 --> 50:25.065
Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn all of it in.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.902
No, I didn't think so.

50:28.984 --> 50:32.784
And Jack Witkowski isn't the kind
of guy to forgive and forget.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.958
He'd find a way to get to you before
we could even bring you to trial.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.253
I've tried to arrest him
for two years.

50:40.621 --> 50:42.339
He's got ties
to the police.

50:42.414 --> 50:45.384
Someone who turns a blind
eye to what he does.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.419
There are some people
in Scotland Yard that think

50:47.503 --> 50:50.302
that Jack is doing us a service.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.975
He kills his fair share
of bad people.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.224
They believe that one in the hand
is worth five in the street.

50:56.303 --> 50:59.102
Think they
can... control him.

51:00.516 --> 51:03.941
<i>But you don't.</i>

51:04.019 --> 51:06.442
After he's paid off

51:06.522 --> 51:10.243
whichever fucking corrupt
coppers are protecting him,

51:10.276 --> 51:13.576
he sells his stuff
on the street at cut price.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.407
<i>He targets
young women,</i>

51:16.448 --> 51:18.496
<i>single mums,</i>

51:18.576 --> 51:22.126
people he thinks
he can control.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.462
That's his specialty.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.470
There is a way
out of it.

51:35.759 --> 51:39.809
What? You help me,
I'll help you.

51:41.724 --> 51:45.854
When Jack comes after
you, we set a trap.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.815
How? You say he took your phone.

51:48.897 --> 51:51.446
Yeah.
When he calls,

51:51.483 --> 51:54.487
you agree to take
the money to him.

51:54.570 --> 51:57.619
You want
to use us as bait?

51:57.698 --> 51:59.371
No.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.953
All right, wait...
No.

52:01.994 --> 52:06.841
Just... If we-if we do it, that means
we walk. <i>This</i> doesn't <i>go in</i> the books.

52:06.915 --> 52:09.384
If I took this to headquarters,
Jack would get wind of it,

52:09.460 --> 52:12.134
I'd be out of a job,
you two would be dead.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.144
Find somewhere safe
for tonight.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.504
<i>Tom.</i>

52:53.545 --> 52:56.674
<i>Tom.</i>

52:56.757 --> 52:59.101
<i>You know he would've
killed you, right?</i>

52:59.176 --> 53:03.397
<i>You fold me to stall. You fold
me the police were coming.</i>

53:03.472 --> 53:05.270
Before.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.898
Why didn't you just show
him where the money was?

53:07.976 --> 53:10.445
Why didn't you tell me
somebody broke into our house.

53:10.521 --> 53:14.025
I just wanted us to have a little
money so we wouldn't get evicted,

53:14.066 --> 53:16.194
so we <i>could</i> have... <i> Shut up!</i>

53:16.235 --> 53:18.237
So we could have a life.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.964
I went
to the fertility clinic,

53:37.047 --> 53:40.517
<i>and I spent
some of the money.</i>

53:42.344 --> 53:43.891
I'm sorry.

53:43.971 --> 53:46.099
I feel so stupid.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.777
<i>It's okay.</i>

53:50.853 --> 53:53.447
Something
was wrong with me.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.240
<i>I</i> just...

53:55.315 --> 53:57.158
It's okay.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.451
Come here.
Come here.

54:04.324 --> 54:07.077
All we wanted
was a family.

54:15.669 --> 54:16.966
<i>It's him.</i>

54:21.759 --> 54:23.602
Hello?

54:23.677 --> 54:25.771
<i>Knock, knock.
Room service.</i>

54:28.766 --> 54:31.690
<i>So, where have you put it? In the
hotel safe or under the bed?</i>

54:31.769 --> 54:35.649
<i>How can you fuck
on that dirty mattress?</i>

54:37.483 --> 54:40.362
<i>People like you
are so predictable, Tommy.</i>

54:42.404 --> 54:46.034
All right, you can have your money.
Just leave us alone.

54:46.116 --> 54:49.290
<i>I want to see you
and the money.</i>

54:49.369 --> 54:51.121
When?
Where?

54:51.163 --> 54:53.131
It needs to be in public
for my safety.

54:53.165 --> 54:56.886
<i>Tomorrow, noon, Victoria
Park by the pond.</i>

54:56.960 --> 54:58.462
And then you
leave us alone.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.801
What now?

55:10.557 --> 55:13.811
The, um, the tracking device
is sewn into the seam.

55:13.852 --> 55:17.902
It's virtually undetectable, and
I can track you on my phone.

55:17.981 --> 55:21.155
As soon as you see him, put
the bag down and walk away.

55:21.235 --> 55:23.033
Don't run,
don't look back.

55:23.111 --> 55:25.159
No exceptions, no
heroics, no nothing.

55:25.239 --> 55:27.037
Just drop and go.

55:27.115 --> 55:31.086
And when we're gone,
you'll arrest him?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.004
Yes, as soon as he picks
up the bag, it's over,

55:33.080 --> 55:35.003
by which time you'll
be gone and safe.

55:35.082 --> 55:37.585
You'll be under
constant supervision.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.342
My men will be watching you,
but you won't see them.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.172
All right.

55:42.214 --> 55:44.012
Drop and go.

55:46.969 --> 55:48.516
Okay.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.280
<i>He's going
to get us killed.</i>

55:58.355 --> 56:00.528
<i>Not if we have back-up.</i>

56:10.701 --> 56:13.124
<i>Bonjour.
Enchantée.</i>

56:13.203 --> 56:16.127
You must be Anna.

56:16.206 --> 56:20.586
I take it Jack Witkowski
paid you a visit.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.262
Yeah.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.965
So, tell me,
Mr. and Mrs. Wright,

56:25.048 --> 56:28.427
what is the plan you want
to speak to me about?

57:17.935 --> 57:19.653
Where is he?

57:19.728 --> 57:21.696
He'll call us.

57:51.635 --> 57:54.388
Where are you?
You're late.

57:54.471 --> 57:58.897
<i>Tell me, Tommy, why are our good
friends from the Met joining us?</i>

57:58.976 --> 58:01.229
Don't worry about him.
He's not with us.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.734
Just let him walk by
and you can have your money.

58:03.814 --> 58:06.658
<i>I'm not talking about that one, you tosser.
He works for me.</i>

58:06.692 --> 58:09.241
Wave to the good
people, Marshall.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.993
<i>I'm talking about that
mangy fuck, Halden.</i>

58:15.826 --> 58:17.328
Run.
Drop the bag.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.253
Fuck.

58:22.332 --> 58:24.505
Marshall, you fucking dick,
get the fucking money.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.432
Drop the bag, Tom.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.019
Drop the bag.

58:38.098 --> 58:40.021
Drop the bag.
Run.

58:41.059 --> 58:42.811
<i>Anna, run.</i>

58:55.782 --> 58:58.626
<i>Why didn't you
just drop the money?</i>

58:58.702 --> 59:01.922
<i>'Cause the money's the only thing
keeping us alive right now.</i>

59:05.751 --> 59:08.049
<i>Halden is dead.</i>

59:08.128 --> 59:09.880
I know.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.591
They killed him.
I know.

59:14.092 --> 59:15.969
Anna.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.286
<i>What are we going
to do, Tom?</i>

59:35.280 --> 59:37.078
<i>Where are we going to go?</i>

59:37.157 --> 59:40.161
<i>We have one place
where we can go.</i>

59:40.243 --> 59:42.621
At least
for a few hours.

59:49.544 --> 59:51.217
<i>You broke your word.</i>

59:51.296 --> 59:53.139
<i>Do you think
I would let you play me?</i>

59:53.215 --> 59:54.842
<i>I'm not trying
to play you, Khan.</i>

59:54.925 --> 59:56.643
When I find you,

59:56.718 --> 59:59.642
just remember you brought
this on yourselves.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:19.950
Would you mind giving us a
minute in private, Mrs. Halden?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:29.630
Yeah, I was going
to grab a coffee anyway.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.139
What in God's name
were you thinking?

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:38.014
Not only were you wearing
a bulletproof vest,

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.221
but you took a firearm
into a public park.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.852
There are children there,
for Christ's sake.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.144
You're an embarrassment.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.821
You should've retired when
your junkie daughter died.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.236
<i>Excuse me, sir. Mr.
Halden needs to rest.</i>

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.662
<i>Okay, my apologies.</i>

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.741
You rest up, John.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.667
Good news for me is

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.710
now I don't have
to pay your pension.

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.255
<i>Who's going to pay
your pension, Ray?</i>

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:11.051
Scotland Yard or guys
like Jack Witkowski?

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.880
I wanted to fix the floor
before I showed it to you.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.392
It's a little different upstairs.
You want to see?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.262
Yeah.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.480
Remember when we started
working on the house

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.563
and we'd eat
take-away on the floor?

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:16.069
Yeah.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:23.624
Remember when I thought
I'd be done in four months?

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.918
Remember when I thought
I'd be pregnant in six?

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.466
I'm sorry I stopped coming here.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:42.434
I'm sorry I got lost
in this place.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.266
I never needed
the house, Tom.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.351
<i>All I needed was us.</i>

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.442
<i>I know.</i>

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.980
We're going to make it.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.026
Tell me we're
going to make it.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.423
<i>It's okay, Boo-boo.
I'm coming.</i>

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.428
<i>Give me your phone.</i>

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.846
Give me your phone.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.695
Sarah?

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.699
<i>You smell so lovely.</i>

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.950
Julian's a real peach.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.203
Hello?

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:31.205
<i>You want kids,
don't you, Tommy?</i>

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.752
<i>Me, too.</i>

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.547
Such a precious gift.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:39.376
So, hurting
little Julian

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.550
it's not going
to be easy for me.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.891
He's so smooth.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.848
<i>What's your plan, Tommy?</i>

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.442
What's your plan, Tommy?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:06.653
<i>We can't go out. After the park, the
police are looking for us, too.</i>

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:16.922
We're hiding out in an old
house in West London.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.044
I'll <i>text you
the address</i>

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.798
<i>and you come
meet us here.</i>

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.513
Okay?

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.100
No more tricks.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.353
Keep fucking quiet.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.879
Better text Khan.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.630
Yeah.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.714
You really think
he's going to come?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.515
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:12.265
It's all about honor
with that guy.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.481
Sent.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.358
You know they're going
to have guns, right?

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.036
Guns are for pussies.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.286
Yeah.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.208
Look who's
come for dinner.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.999
Anna?

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:24.541
Get ready.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.925
This is the perfect place.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:34.805
For what?

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.572
<i>I see no cash.</i>

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:58.992
It's in the house.
Safe.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.827
Don't fuck with me.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.083
<i>Jack, you can have
the money</i>

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:06.416
just as soon as we get
Sarah and Julian.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.353
<i>Where's Mrs. Tommy?</i>

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.682
She's inside,
with the money.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.616
What the fuck.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.327
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.884
<i>Mrs. Tommy.</i>

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:58.721
<i>You got five seconds to show me the
money or I'm shooting your husband.</i>

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.179
<i>The money's up here.</i>

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:03.481
How can I be sure?

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.027
<i>I just want Sarah,
I want Julian,</i>

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.904
<i>but if you hurt them
or my husband,</i>

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.533
<i>I will destroy
all of it.</i>

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:20.866
That's impressive.
I'll get them over.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.553
<i>Get the fuck out, love.</i>

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.846
Now it's your turn.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:02.202
Well done, sweetheart.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:03.999
Now the bag.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.019
Jack?

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.280
Are you all right?

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.123
Sarah!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.670
<i>Sarah!</i>

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.482
Go out the ladder.

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.855
<i>Sarah,
go out the ladder.</i>

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.303
Oh, God. Give me Julian.
Give me Julian

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:00.973
Andre?

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:45.502
<i>You betrayed me, Mr.
Wright.</i>

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.715
<i>You cannot undo that.</i>

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.714
<i>You must</i> be <i>sacrificed
pour le bien de tous.</i>

01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:00.513
<i>The greater good.</i>

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.377
Does not seem fair.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:31.549
You are playing with toys while
I am not playing at all.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:09.002
You are a worthy
adversary.

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.089
Ahh!

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.646
Anna.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.939
<i>Anna.</i>

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.622
<i>Anna.</i>

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.866
<i>Metro Police
today announced a breakthrough</i>

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:29.576
<i>in a case that's traumatized people living
in the sleepy London suburb of Mortlake.</i>

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:34.004
<i>It comes just 36 hours after a
shootout which left five people deed</i>

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:39.260
<i>a house burnt to the ground, and
the entire community in shock.</i>

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.337
<i>With me is Superintendent
Ray Martin,</i>

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.093
<i>one of the officers
in charge of the case.</i>

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:45.516
<i>Superintendent,
what can you tell us?</i>

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.893
<i>We can now confirm
that these tragic events</i>

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:50.767
<i>are directly linked
to a drug turf war</i>

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:55.352
<i>which began with an armed robbery that
turned deadly in an East End night club.</i>

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:58.108
<i>Remarkable.</i> Hi.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:03.068
<i>...and extraordinary bravery of
veteran detective John Halden</i>

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.529
<i>a man I consider to be a
personal friend and a colleague.</i>

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:09.786
It's easy to be a hero when
you're writing your own story.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:16.376
Uh, the firemen
found this.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.756
It's, um...

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.633
It's not much,
but, uh, it's yours.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.102
Good luck.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.899
Hm.

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:56.791
What took you so long?

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.168
I just had to do
one last thing.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:02.172
All right. Say goodbye
to this hell hole.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.631
Come on.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:21.813
So, no more
sushi nights.
