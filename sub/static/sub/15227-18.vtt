01:16.875 --> 01:18.443
ALEX:
     Okay, count of three.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.778
One, two, three!

01:20.846 --> 01:22.046
Come on, Tony!

01:22.114 --> 01:24.048
(cheering)

01:28.955 --> 01:30.555
Down! Down!

01:30.623 --> 01:32.891
(cheering)

01:32.959 --> 01:35.026
The new champ, that's right!

01:35.093 --> 01:36.695
Now, fork over
    that championship belt.

01:36.762 --> 01:37.895
Right now, hand it over.

01:37.963 --> 01:39.163
I lost it.

01:39.231 --> 01:40.565
You lost it?

01:40.633 --> 01:41.733
Then give me your belt.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.935
My belt?
  What are you talking about?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.203
Don't be no sore loser.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.038
Fork it over.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.674
I did it! I did it!

01:49.742 --> 01:51.342
Thank you.
            Hey, uh, nice sport.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.111
(laughing)

01:53.179 --> 01:54.812
Look at you!
          Oh, come on.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.514
You're not going
 to really wear that, are you?

01:56.582 --> 01:57.949
Yeah, I'll have it shortened.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.817
What's left, I'll use
  to cover my steering wheel.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.120
Are you kidding, man?

02:02.187 --> 02:03.454
I'm proud of this thing.

02:03.522 --> 02:06.057
I had to beat
    everybody in the garage.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.491
Oh, well,
      you didn't beat me.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.428
Well, no, he's ducking you.

02:10.496 --> 02:11.596
Oh, I bet.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.698
Well, come on, Elaine.
       I want to be fair.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.600
No!

02:15.668 --> 02:17.802
Come on, uh,
     you can use two hands.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.237
No.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.539
Come on.
   I-I-I'll start from here.

02:21.606 --> 02:22.941
Tony...

02:23.008 --> 02:24.409
Well, what are you,
           all talk?

02:24.477 --> 02:25.576
Yeah, all talk?

02:27.013 --> 02:28.279
You're on!

02:28.347 --> 02:30.115
ALEX:
              Uh-oh. Oh, I don't
                   believe this.

02:30.182 --> 02:31.916
Yeah. One more match.

02:31.984 --> 02:33.985
Oh, come on. You're not going
       to really do this.

02:34.053 --> 02:35.052
Here's the belt.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.488
Well, oh, wait,
                 can I stand up?

02:36.556 --> 02:37.889
Sure.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.324
All right.
        Stand up?

02:39.391 --> 02:41.292
Alex, this is a girl.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.394
I'm going to tear her arms off.

02:43.462 --> 02:44.762
(chuckles)

02:44.830 --> 02:46.664
Well, okay.
    Just don't break a nail.

02:46.732 --> 02:48.666
Let's go. Two hands,
you heard him.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.168
I'm going to count to three.
                        Okay.

02:50.235 --> 02:51.736
Ready?
Piece of cake.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.604
One, two, three!

02:53.672 --> 02:55.606
(cheering)

02:55.674 --> 02:57.241
Come on.
You can do it.

02:57.309 --> 02:58.343
Alex.
                           ALEX:
                Come on, Elaine!

02:58.411 --> 02:59.611
Push!
             Alex.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.379
Come on, Elaine!
Harder! Harder!

03:01.447 --> 03:02.447
(cheering)

03:06.218 --> 03:09.154
All right! I'm the undisputed
      champ of the garage!

03:09.221 --> 03:10.421
No, no, it wasn't fair.

03:10.489 --> 03:11.456
It wasn't fair, Elaine.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.757
Oh, good,
        I'm the disputed

03:12.825 --> 03:14.091
champ of the garage.
           (cheering)

03:15.328 --> 03:17.461
Nah, nah-nah,
         nah-nah, nah.

03:17.529 --> 03:19.630
This isn't funny, Elaine.
                          Aww...

03:19.698 --> 03:21.131
Losing never is, kid.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.202
Whoa!

03:25.270 --> 03:27.538
Yay!

03:27.606 --> 03:29.607
Alex, you know that
wasn't fair, Alex.

03:29.675 --> 03:30.775
No, it wasn't fair.

03:30.843 --> 03:33.044
But then again,
        life seldom is.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.246
(Louie laughs)

03:35.314 --> 03:37.749
And the most unfair part
      is about to walk in.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.222
Banta!
                        (groans)

03:44.290 --> 03:46.591
Nardo told me what happened.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.694
Look, don't feel bad
 about losing the championship.

03:49.761 --> 03:53.130
The most important thing
         is she didn't hurt you.

03:53.198 --> 03:54.633
Did she?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.067
No, but she used two hands.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.502
I was tired. I had...
      Shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.104
She might hear you.

04:00.171 --> 04:02.773
If you rile her,
   she could take you apart.

04:02.841 --> 04:04.575
Look.

04:04.643 --> 04:07.445
I, I know what I'll do
         to cheer you up, Banta.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.547
I'll give you cab 714.

04:09.614 --> 04:11.782
It's got power steering.

04:13.084 --> 04:14.886
(thuds)
              Ooh!

04:14.954 --> 04:16.853
Muscle, too, he's got...

04:16.922 --> 04:18.656
A woman beat him.
                        (laughs)

04:21.226 --> 04:22.394
(groans)

04:22.461 --> 04:23.895
Come on. It's funny.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.163
Not funny.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.733
You have to have a sense
  of humor about these things.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.869
One of the most important things
        in this life...

04:31.937 --> 04:34.205
just walked into the garage.

04:35.507 --> 04:37.041
Tony, you want a coffee?
     Nah.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.943
I'll get you one.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.511
(tapping)

04:40.579 --> 04:42.347
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

04:42.415 --> 04:44.048
Oh, hello.

04:44.116 --> 04:45.550
Excuse me.
                Can you help me?

04:45.617 --> 04:47.885
I'll die trying.

04:49.121 --> 04:51.355
I'm looking for a cabbie.

04:51.423 --> 04:55.560
Why settle for a cabbie
 when you can have the top dog?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.366
Are you the top dog?

05:02.735 --> 05:04.335
Woof, woof.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.905
I'll settle for a cabbie.

05:06.972 --> 05:08.239
All right, that would be me.
         I'm a cabbie.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.175
Hi, uh, uh...
        Can I help you?

05:10.242 --> 05:11.843
Uh, what would you like?
(Louie grunts)

05:11.911 --> 05:14.812
Uh, to get as far away
     from him as possible.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.914
I'll join you.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.148
Want some coffee?
     Sure.

05:18.216 --> 05:19.617
Oh, uh, I'm Alex Rieger.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.820
Diane McKenna.
                Nice to see you.

05:21.887 --> 05:23.054
So, uh, what brings you

05:23.122 --> 05:25.056
to this private,
            little hell of ours?

05:25.124 --> 05:27.925
Well, do you know
        Jim Ignatowski?

05:27.993 --> 05:29.827
Jim Ignatow--
                     sure, I do.

05:29.895 --> 05:31.161
Oh, good.

05:31.229 --> 05:32.864
Well, I'm an old friend of his.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.198
Of course,
       I haven't seen him

05:34.266 --> 05:36.734
since we lived on the same
      commune in the '60s.

05:36.801 --> 05:38.737
You lived on
                 a commune? You?

05:38.804 --> 05:41.205
Yeah.

05:41.273 --> 05:43.708
Of course, a lot of people
find that hard to believe.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.810
I guess they can't picture me
frolicking naked

05:45.878 --> 05:47.779
through the alfalfa sprouts.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.280
I can.

05:50.682 --> 05:53.017
I've been doing it
 ever since you walked in here.

05:53.085 --> 05:56.087
I guess we're not as
           far away as possible.

05:56.155 --> 05:57.855
I bet you they
              never had anything

05:57.923 --> 05:59.190
like Louie on that commune.

05:59.257 --> 06:01.492
Oh, no, but, uh,
when we first got there,

06:01.560 --> 06:03.494
we did find
something similar

06:03.562 --> 06:04.596
living in the barn.

06:04.663 --> 06:05.663
(chuckles):
           I know what you mean.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.298
(grumbles)

06:07.366 --> 06:08.933
That's cute,
               that's real cute.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.935
(Alex laughing)

06:16.208 --> 06:18.743
Wait a minute.

06:23.582 --> 06:26.584
I haven't seen one of you
         for 13 years.

06:28.753 --> 06:31.522
Jim!

06:31.590 --> 06:33.290
It must be her.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.693
Oh, Jim...

06:35.761 --> 06:37.295
You haven't changed a bit.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.363
Diane McKenna.

06:39.431 --> 06:40.898
I'm mad at you.

06:40.966 --> 06:43.201
What are you talking about?

06:43.268 --> 06:47.205
You were supposed
         to meet me at Woodstock

06:47.273 --> 06:51.709
13 years ago,
        but you never showed up.

06:51.777 --> 06:53.677
I was beginning to worry.

06:55.046 --> 06:57.047
Woodstock?

06:57.115 --> 06:58.416
Jim, don't you remember?

06:58.484 --> 07:00.285
Just before you left
for the concert,

07:00.352 --> 07:01.953
you gave me that speech
that convinced me

07:02.021 --> 07:04.622
to give up our way of life
and go back to school.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.857
I did?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.993
Yeah. You told me
     I didn't fit in and...

07:09.061 --> 07:10.594
that I never would.

07:10.662 --> 07:14.532
No, no, I was talking
           about the Volkswagen.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.835
We already had 12 people.

07:16.902 --> 07:20.171
I assumed you'd
              find another ride.

07:20.239 --> 07:23.374
Well, maybe you were
talking about the Volkswagen

07:23.442 --> 07:26.277
at that particular moment,
but you always did tell me

07:26.345 --> 07:27.545
I should go
to law school.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.715
Yeah, but after the concert.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.022
How did you do
                  in law school?

07:38.090 --> 07:41.125
Well, I graduated
from Stanford,

07:41.192 --> 07:44.028
third in my class.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.698
Well, you always
                      were lazy.

07:49.067 --> 07:51.702
Jim, uh, can I take you
           someplace

07:51.770 --> 07:54.204
where I can buy you a drink?

07:54.272 --> 07:56.040
Oh, sure.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.709
Uh, how about a bar?

08:05.384 --> 08:06.918
Bye, Alex.
Nice meeting you.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.786
Yeah, you, too.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.824
How do you like that?

08:13.892 --> 08:16.461
Beauty and the Bean Brain.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.664
Hey, Alex?

08:20.732 --> 08:22.566
You really liked her,
didn't you?
                   Huh?

08:22.634 --> 08:24.602
Yeah, I thought she was, uh,
       pretty attractive.

08:24.669 --> 08:26.804
I mean, I'm not going to,
         uh, you know,

08:26.872 --> 08:28.940
go crazy
    over a chance encounter.

08:29.007 --> 08:30.174
I mean, I'm just
                going to take it

08:30.242 --> 08:31.675
one step at a time
           and see what happens.

08:31.743 --> 08:33.409
And now, if
               you'll excuse me,

08:33.477 --> 08:35.246
I'm going to have her name
            tattooed on my face.

09:11.116 --> 09:13.150
(burps)

09:17.556 --> 09:21.058
(humming)

09:21.126 --> 09:23.094
Will you knock it off?

09:23.162 --> 09:25.395
You know, you're sick.
      You're really sick.

09:25.463 --> 09:27.398
Sick.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.238
What are you
doing now?

09:34.306 --> 09:36.340
I'm giving you
                  the belt back.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.378
Yeah, well, I ain't
        taking it back.

09:40.445 --> 09:42.513
Not without a rematch.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.548
You're on.

09:44.616 --> 09:46.116
You got it.
                        (laughs)

09:46.184 --> 09:48.185
You know, wait, Tony,
       you know, if you beat me,

09:48.253 --> 09:50.755
I mean, all you've done
  is beaten a woman and nobody

09:50.823 --> 09:52.857
around this garage is going
 to put you on their shoulders.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.158
Yeah, yeah, but I'm going
          to give you

09:54.226 --> 09:56.227
the same advantage I gave you
    last time, see, Elaine?

09:56.294 --> 09:57.561
I'm going to start from here.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.897
You can use two hands
      <i>and</i> you can stand up.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.565
Okay, it's a big advantage.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.868
Ah-ah, all right, I still don't
     think I can beat you.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.304
But just on the outside chance
          that I can--

10:06.372 --> 10:09.173
(chuckles) you are never
     going to live it down.
Yeah, yeah.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.607
Yeah, well, let me tell
         you something.

10:10.675 --> 10:12.043
I ain't losing this time,
                     What? What?

10:12.110 --> 10:13.444
'cause last time I was tired.
                             Oh.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.413
You're dead meat.
         Get over here.
                            Ooh.

10:15.481 --> 10:19.516
You know, you do look a little
    tired today, too, Tony.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.485
Okay, on three.

10:21.553 --> 10:23.620
One.
 Well, you know what, uh, uh...

10:23.688 --> 10:25.122
I had, like, a rough night
          last night.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.290
I didn't get much sleep.

10:26.358 --> 10:28.526
Oh... Two.

10:28.593 --> 10:31.395
And I skipped lunch.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.564
Three.
      Keep, keep the belt.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.566
(chuckles)

10:36.802 --> 10:38.736
(muttering)

10:40.472 --> 10:41.572
Hey, Tony? Tony?

10:41.639 --> 10:42.940
Jim in yet?

10:43.008 --> 10:45.476
Alex, that's the third time
     you asked me that. No.

10:45.543 --> 10:47.044
I know. I'm sorry
I'm so impatient.

10:47.112 --> 10:48.913
I just wanted to get
Diane's number from him.

10:50.415 --> 10:55.252
Welcome to today's episode
     of <i>As The Loser Turns.</i>

10:55.320 --> 10:57.555
The daily drama

10:57.623 --> 11:00.524
that chronicles
    the sad and frustrating

11:00.592 --> 11:04.428
sex life of our lonely hero,
          Alex Rieger.

11:04.496 --> 11:06.230
Will you knock it off?!

11:06.298 --> 11:08.499
Alex's nerves are frayed

11:08.567 --> 11:12.703
after a sleepless night
of torment and lust

11:12.771 --> 11:17.108
over a woman who wants him
as much as she wants ringworm.

11:19.077 --> 11:20.444
Jim, Jim. Uh...

11:20.512 --> 11:21.679
I want to tell
                  you something.

11:21.746 --> 11:23.147
Huh?

11:23.215 --> 11:26.750
You remember when that girl
 Diane walked in here yesterday?

11:26.818 --> 11:28.251
You know...
                      (chuckles)

11:28.319 --> 11:30.354
I had this feeling
                  of electricity

11:30.421 --> 11:31.789
just run through
                   me, you know?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.491
Electricity, huh?
                           Yeah.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.492
And I-I-I didn't know
            how to deal with it.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.861
Uh... Have you tried
fabric softener?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.231
Jim, Jim...
                        I, um...

11:43.434 --> 11:46.103
I just... I just want to
         get to know her better.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.972
Oh, you should.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.308
Yeah, she's a wonderful girl.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.442
Yeah, I...
                     I think so.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.277
I'll call her and set it up.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.445
No, no, just give me
          her number. I'll call.

11:54.512 --> 11:56.614
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. My treat.

11:56.681 --> 11:58.048
No, come on, Jim. I
    couldn't ask you to do that.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.217
I really should.

11:59.284 --> 12:01.785
No, not another word.

12:03.388 --> 12:06.056
Incidentally,
I have a simple device

12:06.124 --> 12:08.626
for memorizing phone numbers.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.996
I assign each digit a letter

12:12.063 --> 12:13.898
and make an easy-to-remember
word out of it.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.600
For instance,
her number is "fblwrkz."

12:20.839 --> 12:22.973
Hello, Diane.

12:23.041 --> 12:26.009
Uh, are you, uh, free
             for dinner tonight?

12:26.077 --> 12:27.311
Oh, good.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.013
How does burgers
                 and beer sound?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.481
No, no, no, no.
      Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.648
Huh?

12:31.716 --> 12:32.717
Uh, something intimate
         and romantic.

12:32.784 --> 12:33.884
A fine French meal.

12:33.952 --> 12:38.256
Uh-huh. How does
 a, uh, fine French meal sound?

12:38.323 --> 12:39.690
Oh, great.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.392
Chez Robert. 8:00.

12:41.459 --> 12:43.694
Chez Robert. 8:00.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.697
Can't wait to see you.
                     Bye, Diane.

12:46.764 --> 12:47.565
Wait, Jim!

12:47.632 --> 12:48.498
Oh, wait, Diane!

12:48.566 --> 12:49.567
What about me?

12:49.635 --> 12:50.601
What about you?

12:50.668 --> 12:52.803
Jim, I thought
      this whole thing was

12:52.871 --> 12:54.405
for <i>me</i> to have dinner
          with Diane.

12:59.077 --> 13:03.347
Uh, Diane, do you mind
            if Alex comes along?

13:03.415 --> 13:05.783
No...

13:05.850 --> 13:07.351
You're set.
Thanks.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.989
<i>Au revoir.</i>

13:14.325 --> 13:16.794
Well, Alex,
       you got your wish.

13:16.862 --> 13:19.696
An intimate,
romantic dinner for three.

13:19.764 --> 13:22.032
Yeah, thanks, Jim.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.335
You owe me one.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.272
Well, at least
  I'm having dinner with her.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.207
Hey, at least
it's a start, right?

13:30.275 --> 13:34.811
Will our lonely, frustrated
       hero, Alex Reiger,

13:34.879 --> 13:40.550
make a fool of himself
at the Chez Ptomaine restaurant?

13:40.618 --> 13:43.254
Will he get lucky
            with the lady lawyer

13:43.322 --> 13:44.922
or will he wind up

13:44.990 --> 13:47.491
with her heel
                     in his eye?

13:47.559 --> 13:51.261
Tune in tomorrow
 when we'll hear Reiger say...

13:51.329 --> 13:52.530
How would you like me
        to shove that microphone

13:52.597 --> 13:54.098
right down your throat?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.799
All that and more

13:55.867 --> 14:00.937
on tomorrow's episode
     of <i>As The Loser Turns.</i>

14:10.948 --> 14:12.449
(electronic beeping)

14:12.517 --> 14:14.985
I mean, there's nothing worse
    than putting all that effort

14:15.053 --> 14:16.653
into a case and then losing.

14:16.721 --> 14:19.089
Yeah, I can imagine.

14:19.157 --> 14:23.294
And sometimes my clients
blame me for their convictions.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.695
<i>Excusezmoi, monsieur,</i>

14:24.763 --> 14:27.798
but the other customers are
  complaining about the noise.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.668
Uh, no problem.
              I'll turn it down.

14:31.736 --> 14:34.505
No, no, no, it's not
the noise of the game, monsieur.

14:34.572 --> 14:38.009
It's the "yahoos,"
the "yipees," and the "gotchas."

14:38.076 --> 14:41.679
Oh. I'll turn down
                 my volume, too.

14:41.746 --> 14:43.681
<i>Merci.</i>

14:45.283 --> 14:46.950
Classy place.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.955
You were, uh...
You were saying

14:52.023 --> 14:54.525
that, uh, your clients blame
you when they're convicted.

14:54.593 --> 14:55.759
Oh, yes.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.496
Yes, in fact, one guy
         even stood up and said,

14:58.563 --> 15:01.498
"I'm gonna get you if
      it's the last thing I do."

15:01.566 --> 15:02.667
No kidding?

15:02.734 --> 15:04.101
What happened?
                      He got me.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.469
He did?

15:05.537 --> 15:06.937
He wasn't a murderer.

15:07.005 --> 15:08.105
He was a flasher.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.340
(chuckling):
              Oh.

15:10.408 --> 15:13.010
(whispering):
    Yahoo! Yippee! Gottcha!

15:13.078 --> 15:14.344
What happened?

15:14.412 --> 15:16.346
I zapped a Martian mushball.

15:18.116 --> 15:20.851
You know, you know, I was always
     fascinated by the law.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.319
Oh.

15:22.387 --> 15:24.655
Yeah, I mean, you get to save
   people's lives, you know?

15:24.723 --> 15:26.423
The only thing I ever do
       for my fellow man

15:26.491 --> 15:28.025
is get him
    to the airport on time.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.894
But I have had some,
uh, very interesting

15:30.962 --> 15:32.596
experiences as a cab driver.

15:32.664 --> 15:34.898
I mean, you have to have
interesting experiences

15:34.966 --> 15:36.433
as a cab driver.
                        (laughs)

15:36.501 --> 15:37.668
You know, there are some, uh,

15:37.736 --> 15:40.571
strange, bizarre
    characters in the city.

15:40.638 --> 15:42.573
Yeah, that's why
     I keep my door locked.

15:47.612 --> 15:48.813
You know, just the other day...

15:48.880 --> 15:50.714
Just the other day,
this guy gets in my cab...

15:50.782 --> 15:52.583
Uh, no, wait a minute,
that's not interesting.

15:52.650 --> 15:53.750
Um, no.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.919
Oh, yeah, there was this woman,

15:55.987 --> 15:57.354
she gets in the cab
        and she tries...

15:57.422 --> 15:58.555
No, no, that wasn't good.

15:58.623 --> 16:00.590
Um, oh, got it! Got it.

16:00.658 --> 16:01.759
There was this couple.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.227
They flagged me down.
       No, wait a minute.

16:03.294 --> 16:04.394
That didn't happen to me.

16:04.462 --> 16:06.563
Uh, don't worry.
I'll think of one.

16:06.631 --> 16:07.931
Excuse me, Alex.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.166
Where is the ladies' room?

16:09.234 --> 16:11.468
To the right
       of the pay phone.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.070
Will you excuse me?

16:13.138 --> 16:17.107
Yeah, sure.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.209
Oh, I remember one.

16:18.276 --> 16:19.576
I'll be back.
                It'll keep.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.282
You like Diane,
        don't you, Alex?

16:25.350 --> 16:26.716
Yeah, I do.
I really do.

16:26.784 --> 16:29.286
Hey, listen, Jim,
um, you know,

16:29.354 --> 16:31.788
when I said that I wanted
to get to know Diane better,

16:31.856 --> 16:36.894
I was, uh, hoping for an evening
with just the two of us.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.997
Well, it's not too late, Alex.

16:40.064 --> 16:41.999
I'll send her home.

16:45.403 --> 16:48.638
I was talking
     about just her and me.

16:48.706 --> 16:53.143
Oh. You should get
      to know each other.

16:53.211 --> 16:54.978
Yeah.

16:55.046 --> 16:57.548
I want you two
                  to be friends.

16:57.616 --> 16:58.749
Thanks, Jim.
                     I'll leave.

16:58.816 --> 17:00.617
No, no, no. You can't
leave now. It'll...

17:00.685 --> 17:02.419
Not in the middle of dinner.
It'll be awkward.

17:02.487 --> 17:03.687
It won't be awkward.

17:03.755 --> 17:05.089
Just tell her I'm sick.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.891
No, no, no. That would
     sound a little phony.

17:06.958 --> 17:08.425
I mean, I don't think
      she'd believe that.

17:08.492 --> 17:12.195
She'll believe it if she asks
    any of these folks here.

17:12.262 --> 17:14.231
Huh?

17:15.467 --> 17:18.102
Oh!
Jim!

17:18.170 --> 17:22.606
Oh, oh, my stomach!
Jim.

17:22.673 --> 17:25.509
My guts are going
        to explode. Oh!

17:25.577 --> 17:28.178
Jim. Jim, please.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.781
What's in the veal?

17:31.849 --> 17:34.885
Oh, I'm going home!

17:34.953 --> 17:37.921
I've got a stomach pump there.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.628
Everything's fine.

17:44.695 --> 17:48.231
Uh, believe me,
everything is fine.

17:48.299 --> 17:49.400
Oh.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.400
Where's Jim?

17:50.468 --> 17:53.504
Uh, he left.
He wanted us to be alone.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.438
He-He made believe
he was sick.

17:55.506 --> 17:56.807
I mean, you should
have seen that one.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.008
No.
He did everything

17:58.076 --> 18:00.377
but make his head revolve
and spit up pea soup.

18:00.445 --> 18:02.379
I don't understand.

18:02.447 --> 18:03.947
Don't try to understand it.

18:04.015 --> 18:06.850
I mean, on the Ignatowski scale
 of weird, it was just a three.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.186
Please.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.421
He's all right, he's all right.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.688
I mean, all the guys
   down at the garage think,

18:11.756 --> 18:12.823
you know, he's wonderful.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.858
We all think
he's adorable.

18:14.926 --> 18:17.895
Because what he lacks up here,
      he's got right here.

18:17.962 --> 18:20.363
But listen, you know,
   I have to admit I'm, uh...

18:20.431 --> 18:22.199
I'm really glad
    he's not here right now.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.202
What do you mean,
    "What he lacks up here?"

18:25.270 --> 18:27.337
Well, you know,
       he's-he's a flake.

18:27.405 --> 18:28.938
He's kind of spacey.
I mean, uh...

18:29.006 --> 18:30.174
Oh.

18:30.241 --> 18:33.043
His porch light has been
flickering for years,

18:33.111 --> 18:34.477
if you know what I mean.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.048
But let's not
talk about Jim.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.618
Listen, Diane, uh, you know,
I've known a lot of women,

18:41.686 --> 18:44.454
but, uh, I think
you're kind of special.

18:44.522 --> 18:46.557
I mean, you're bright,
you're beautiful.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.124
I got a...
I-I really have to, uh...

18:48.192 --> 18:49.393
You know, when you walked
into that garage,

18:49.461 --> 18:50.627
I must tell you...

18:50.695 --> 18:51.995
Uh, Alex. Uh,
               before you go on,

18:52.063 --> 18:54.031
I must tell you something.

18:54.098 --> 18:55.632
I am involved with someone.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.401
Oh, how involved?

18:57.468 --> 19:00.603
Emotionally
    and physically involved.

19:00.671 --> 19:02.473
Oh.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.309
Anyone I know?
           (chuckles)

19:05.376 --> 19:07.110
Yes.

19:07.178 --> 19:10.781
The, uh, flake with
  the flickering porch light?

19:13.385 --> 19:14.518
Jim?

19:19.323 --> 19:21.291
Will there be anything else,
           monsieur?

19:21.359 --> 19:24.761
Yes, I'd like a small glass
       of poison, please.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.763
Anything for you?

19:26.831 --> 19:31.702
(doorbell ringing repeatedly)

19:32.937 --> 19:34.905
Yeah, yeah.
    I said, "Wait a minute."

19:34.972 --> 19:37.308
(ringing continues)

19:37.375 --> 19:39.243
Who is it?

19:39.310 --> 19:41.245
JIM:
                      The flake!

19:45.316 --> 19:49.119
Remember me,
                     the weirdo?

19:49.186 --> 19:50.621
Huh.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.523
The-The man with the
    flickering porch lights.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.162
The man you call spacey.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.765
I made a mistake.
       I made a mistake.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.301
I'll explain it all tomorrow

20:04.368 --> 20:06.703
and you'll see that maybe if you
told me about you and Diane...

20:06.771 --> 20:09.973
I don't want
                 an explanation.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.109
It doesn't matter why
     you said those things.

20:12.176 --> 20:13.977
All I know is
       that you said them

20:14.045 --> 20:17.180
and that means
       you don't love me.

20:21.252 --> 20:23.320
Oh, Jim, it's very late.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.055
Admit, Alex.
   You don't love me, do you?

20:26.123 --> 20:30.093
Jim, I don't know if I love
anybody at 3:00 in the morning.

20:30.161 --> 20:32.295
Look, I'm not going to baby you.

20:32.363 --> 20:35.232
Sometimes I like you, and
sometimes you get on my nerves.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.500
I know that I like you,

20:36.567 --> 20:37.968
but I don't know
    if I love you right now.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.402
Well, I know.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.306
You don't love me or you
       wouldn't call me a flake.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.607
But you are a flake.

20:45.443 --> 20:48.245
And all I mean by that is
you've done some strange things.

20:48.313 --> 20:49.446
Name one!

20:50.715 --> 20:51.815
Huh?

20:51.883 --> 20:54.184
You lived in a condemned
    building for four years.

20:54.251 --> 20:57.620
You're confusing flakiness
          with style.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.492
You burned down
       Louie's apartment.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.994
It was an accident.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.196
I left something
   on the stove for too long.

21:06.264 --> 21:08.799
Yeah, a beanbag chair.

21:08.866 --> 21:11.902
And you kept a broken-down
racehorse in your own apartment.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.403
That horse had a name.

21:13.471 --> 21:14.838
I know. Gary.

21:14.906 --> 21:17.007
And you let him sleep
in your bedroom.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.376
Well, not everybody
         has a guest room, Alex.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.712
Jim! Jim!

21:21.780 --> 21:25.115
You hung on the wall in a
radiation suit for three days,

21:25.183 --> 21:27.251
thinking it was a sleeping bag.

21:27.318 --> 21:28.418
I did?

21:28.486 --> 21:29.352
Yeah.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.721
Ha!

21:30.788 --> 21:31.955
Oh, my...

21:32.023 --> 21:34.525
Ha! Boy, I'm a lunatic!

21:37.028 --> 21:39.563
Do you remember
    cutting up your own van?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.065
What did I do with it?

21:42.133 --> 21:45.269
You made a sculpture out of it.
  That's what you did with it.

21:45.336 --> 21:47.738
(laughing)
                     Oh, no!

21:47.806 --> 21:48.939
Oh, my!

21:49.006 --> 21:51.074
You know what my favorite
one of all time was?

21:51.142 --> 21:54.244
Uh, no, but I
                     wish I did.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.480
It wasn't something you did,
it was something you said.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.116
I mean, it wasn't just funny,
it was quotable.

21:59.183 --> 22:01.284
It was so priceless,
I repeated it to everybody.

22:01.352 --> 22:03.921
You told me that if you
could be anybody in the world,

22:03.988 --> 22:05.188
you'd still be yourself,

22:05.256 --> 22:07.925
so you wouldn't have
to buy new clothes.

22:07.992 --> 22:09.927
(laughing)

22:13.731 --> 22:14.831
(sighs)

22:14.899 --> 22:16.533
You remember that?

22:16.601 --> 22:19.236
Yeah.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.471
You quote me?

22:21.538 --> 22:23.840
Yeah.

22:23.908 --> 22:26.743
You remember little
                 things about me

22:26.811 --> 22:29.245
that I don't even
               remember, myself.

22:29.313 --> 22:32.182
Well...

22:32.250 --> 22:35.686
You think I'm a flake,

22:35.753 --> 22:38.388
but you love me.

22:41.292 --> 22:45.329
My God, I think I do.

22:45.396 --> 22:48.966
Well, I'm glad
                 that's settled.

22:49.033 --> 22:50.968
Yeah.

22:53.404 --> 22:56.507
I better go back to Diane.

22:56.574 --> 23:00.643
She thinks I'm in the bathroom,
       brushing my teeth.

23:03.247 --> 23:04.781
Good night.
                     Good night.

23:24.269 --> 23:28.438
(theme song playing)

23:48.459 --> 23:49.759
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:49.827 --> 23:50.927
(man grumbling)
