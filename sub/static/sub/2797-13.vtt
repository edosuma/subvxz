00:19.000 --> 00:21.750
OK, stop.
OK, OK, stop.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.041
If our video is Heidi's

we will be bonafide

Explodes the bottle.

tips the trash cans,
releases the catapult,

launches the monkey wrench,

just knocked Accordion Dave

00:54.875 --> 00:58.000

01:02.667 --> 01:04.542
I'm never going to

You guys are hilarious.

01:07.166 --> 01:09.959
I literally L.'d O. L.
Literally.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.041
You guys were funny. Especially
when you got hit in the guts.

01:13.125 --> 01:14.959
(all cheering)

01:15.041 --> 01:17.458
Mission accomplished,
Cunningham.

01:17.542 --> 01:18.792
We're Net-lebrities!

01:18.875 --> 01:20.834
Uh, I think you mean
celebri-Webs.

01:20.917 --> 01:23.083
All I know is, once you're
famous on the Internet,

01:23.166 --> 01:25.125
you're famous forever.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.667
That movie
made me have feelings.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.083
I hate having feelings!
Get him!

02:02.959 --> 02:06.083
(French accent) My first
American-style wedgie.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.000
Well, I'm off to lunch.
(chuckles)

02:08.083 --> 02:09.834
Gonna see what kind
of VIP line-cutting

02:09.917 --> 02:11.750
this new found fame
will get me.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.583
Howard, wait.
We can't let Jacques suffer

02:14.667 --> 02:17.792
just because he made
a super-lame video.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.583
Can't forget our roots.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.166
Bash, settle.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.667
Jacques mean you no harm.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.250
You guys are famous,

02:24.333 --> 02:26.875
which means I gotta
do what you tell me.

02:26.959 --> 02:29.083
This I do not understand.

02:29.166 --> 02:32.041
Bash did not
enjoy my docu-poem?

02:32.125 --> 02:33.542
Jacques,
you're not from here.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.375
So you don't know what
makes a video... (whistles)

02:35.458 --> 02:37.500
And what makes a video...
(raspberry)

02:37.583 --> 02:39.291
-You follow?
-Ah, <i>oui, oui!</i>

02:39.375 --> 02:41.750
I would like to learn the
meaning of your many sounds.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.667
We're about to shoot
our next video.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.083
You should come along.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.125
<i>Oui.</i> I will bring
my video camera

02:47.208 --> 02:48.959
to document
your cinema film.

02:49.041 --> 02:52.083
And I will bring the balls
to hit Howard in the guts.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.750
And I will bring the guts.

02:56.917 --> 02:59.458
Allow me to explain
our secret recipe

02:59.542 --> 03:02.792
for chart-topping vids.
One part funny characters.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.458
Baron von Bananas.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.166
A dash of intriguing setting.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.041
Kiddie pool full
of chocolate pudding.

03:08.125 --> 03:11.208
And a pantload of guys
getting hit in the guts.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.583
You can't go wrong
with a classic.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.709
Mix all that together
and you got us.

03:15.792 --> 03:19.041
We are the secret sauce
that we put in every clip.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.083
<i>Oui?</i>

03:20.166 --> 03:22.625
Well, we are...

03:22.709 --> 03:24.875
(scoffs) This guy's
here for five minutes

03:24.959 --> 03:27.000
and he thinks he's
part of our "I" posse.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.250
So I must ask myself.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.208
What is the secret
of Jacques' sauce?

03:30.291 --> 03:32.458
Exactly.
Now don't feel bad

03:32.542 --> 03:33.875
if it doesn't come
right away.

03:33.959 --> 03:37.291
We are comedy geniuses.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.709
(gasps)

03:38.792 --> 03:41.291
Cunningham, where's
my gorilla head?

03:42.959 --> 03:44.583
(exclaims)

03:44.667 --> 03:46.000
(grunting)

03:51.875 --> 03:54.208
Not to worry,
my new BFF friends.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.375
Jacques will save you!

04:03.333 --> 04:06.583
(distorted) <i>What the juice?</i>

04:06.667 --> 04:09.792
That just happened.
H. Dub's hot pick of the day.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.083
Maybe the year.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.875
(all cheering)

04:15.417 --> 04:17.709
Howard, is it even
possible to be bigger

04:17.792 --> 04:19.000
than an Internet celebrity?

04:19.083 --> 04:21.208
I think we're
about to find out.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.583
Remember, stay humble,
Cunningham.

04:24.875 --> 04:25.875
(both) Hmm?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.792
Where'd you learn
those sweet moves?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.875
I literally would date you.
Literally.

04:32.959 --> 04:37.083
Randy, Howard.
I found my secret sauce.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.166
It is the jumping off
of things.

04:39.250 --> 04:42.834
They actually liked
that better than us.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.667
We used our Net-librity
to create a new celebri-Web

04:45.750 --> 04:46.917
who isn't us!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.041
<i>In my country,</i>
<i>the babies are taught</i>

04:49.125 --> 04:50.709
<i>first to walk on the hands,</i>

04:50.792 --> 04:52.458
then on the feet.
<i>N'cest-ce pas?</i>

04:52.542 --> 04:55.458
When can we scope more
of your amazing skills?

04:55.542 --> 04:58.834
Well, since you are loving
my secret sauce so much,

04:58.917 --> 05:01.625
I am happy to do a demonstration
after the school.

05:01.709 --> 05:02.875
After school, live.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.250
Jacques jumps off
a bunch of stuff.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.709
<i>It is on!</i>

05:05.792 --> 05:08.417
His secret sauce is
jumping off of things?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.542
If only we knew someone
as good as Jacques

05:10.625 --> 05:13.333
at unnecessary flipping
and superfluous wall-running.

05:13.417 --> 05:14.792
Howard, you're right.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.208
It's time we bring in
the big guy.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.417
Awesome! I'll call
my cousin Vic.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.959
I know you're not
crazy about him,

05:20.041 --> 05:24.000
but sweet cheese,
that kid can flip.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.583
Oh, the Ninja.
Yeah, that works.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.000
(all cheering)

05:37.083 --> 05:39.959
Jacques, all of the Internet
is watching.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.250
Anything you want to say?

05:41.333 --> 05:44.458
I hope my secret sauce
will show the world

05:44.542 --> 05:46.583
that any obstacle
life throws at you

05:46.667 --> 05:48.875
can be flipped over,
jumped off,

05:48.959 --> 05:50.667
or doven through.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.500
Mademoiselle Heidi,

05:52.583 --> 05:53.959
please take my camera,

05:54.041 --> 05:56.333
and capture the art
I am about to make.

05:56.417 --> 05:59.000
-Ready when you are.
-And now, I begin.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.125
(music begins playing)

06:01.208 --> 06:03.250
(exclaiming)

06:05.333 --> 06:06.709
<i>Voila!</i>

06:06.792 --> 06:08.083
(all chanting) Jacques!

06:08.166 --> 06:10.667
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

06:10.750 --> 06:12.875
<i>(exclaiming)</i>

06:14.750 --> 06:16.041

06:16.125 --> 06:17.875
Ninja!
Welcome to my Internet.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.750
Oh, no. Allow me
to welcome you

06:20.834 --> 06:22.083
to my Internet.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.542
Try to keep up.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.625
(all chanting) Ninja!

06:30.709 --> 06:34.083
(laughs) A flip-off, is it?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.750
(all chanting) Jacques!

06:39.834 --> 06:41.041
(groaning)

06:44.750 --> 06:46.208
(car alarms)

06:59.750 --> 07:01.959
Ninja just showed Jacques
how we jump off of stuff

07:02.041 --> 07:02.959
in the 'Ville.

07:03.041 --> 07:05.000
But the jumping
is my sauce.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.834
It has been great flipping
for you, everybody.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.291
Smoke bomb!

07:09.375 --> 07:11.959
But Ninja stole
my secret sauce,

07:12.041 --> 07:15.959
and humiliated <i>moi</i>
in front of my own camera.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.917
Do you smell that?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.625
It is the scent
of humiliation.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.500
No.
(sniffing)

07:24.583 --> 07:27.417
Imported humiliation.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
It pairs nicely
with a side of this.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.750
(squeaking)

07:34.583 --> 07:37.250
(laughing) You totally
schooled Jacques.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.542
-I did, didn't I?
-Totally.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.417
You think maybe it was
a little too...

07:41.500 --> 07:42.792
Harsh? Oh, yeah.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.166
You destroyed him
in front of everyone.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.250
(sighs)

07:45.333 --> 07:46.625
I should apologize,
shouldn't I?

07:46.709 --> 07:49.000
What? No!
Don't apologize.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.875
Look, I'm no Ninja-nomicon,

07:50.959 --> 07:53.458
but the Ninja shouldn't
have to apologize

07:53.542 --> 07:55.625
-because he's awesome!
-You're right.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.875
You are no Ninja-nomicon.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.083
(whimpering)

08:00.166 --> 08:01.834
Look, Jacques.
It occurs to me

08:01.917 --> 08:06.041
that maybe I possibly could have
a little bit humiliated you.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.083
(groaning)

08:08.166 --> 08:11.208
Oh, don't do that.
There is no need for that.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.959
(growling)

08:14.583 --> 08:15.583
(all shouting)

08:15.667 --> 08:17.250
(Howard) Action.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.458
Thanks, Ninja.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.083
Also, action!

08:25.709 --> 08:28.041
Look, if I didn't say it before,
I'm officially sorry.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.083
Now we're making a movie.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.792
Taste my sauce!

08:37.875 --> 08:39.917
How about I give you
a taste of...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.875
...my Ninja tripping balls!

08:41.959 --> 08:43.583
(both exclaiming)

08:45.041 --> 08:46.917
Gonna need you
to do that again.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.625
Thought I was recording.
Wasn't.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.125
Kinda contemplating
de-stankage here.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.959
(Jacques) Super.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.750
Howard, the camera.
I have to destroy it.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.792
No way. I haven't finished
filming the fight.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.083
This thing's guaranteed to be
H. Dub's pick of the decade!

09:01.166 --> 09:02.083
(shouts)

09:02.166 --> 09:06.208
That is my camera!

09:06.291 --> 09:08.208
Uh, Jacques took the camera.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.333
I need that camera.

09:13.417 --> 09:14.959
Never!

09:15.041 --> 09:17.458
Ho, ho!
Right in the guts.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.000
Ninja Stomp!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.583
Totally planned that.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.333
(groaning)

09:31.959 --> 09:34.208
Curse you, Ninja!

09:34.291 --> 09:38.041
Shame to waste
a good vintage.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.500
(squeaks)

09:39.583 --> 09:41.500
Hi-ya!

09:41.583 --> 09:43.291
(grunts) Thanks, Ninja.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.959
My tender parts were
starting to chafe.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.041
It's why I do what I do.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.000
Howard, I have to make
this up to Jacques.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.917
And you're gonna help me.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.875
(baby crying)

09:57.542 --> 09:59.667
(clock ticking)

09:59.750 --> 10:02.041

10:04.458 --> 10:05.959

10:06.041 --> 10:08.000

10:23.000 --> 10:25.417

10:26.959 --> 10:29.458
That worked
on every level.

10:29.542 --> 10:33.041
<i>And now we can all see why</i>
<i>H. Dub's pick of the day...</i>

What is this?

10:43.625 --> 10:46.709
We lose to a rodent
on the drums?

10:46.792 --> 10:48.375
How is this possible?

10:52.750 --> 10:54.291
-(laughing)
-It's a possum.

10:54.375 --> 10:55.667
On the drums!

10:55.750 --> 10:57.875
And he's got
perfect rhythm.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.500
Your Internet makes no sense.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.875
(Randy groans) This might be
the most boring week ever.

11:04.959 --> 11:08.125
No monsters, no robots,
no reason to Ninja out.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.834
The only thing getting me
through this week

11:09.917 --> 11:12.083
is the big championship!

11:12.166 --> 11:14.542
Yes! I cannot wait

11:14.625 --> 11:17.083
to see Norrisville
destroy Flackville in...

11:17.166 --> 11:19.542
Uh, what sport
is this again?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.667
Not a clue.
But whatever it is,

11:21.750 --> 11:23.542
we're getting our fan on.

11:23.625 --> 11:25.625
-(grunts)
-Easy-teasy here,

11:25.709 --> 11:27.625
bringing you the deets
on the big championship.

11:27.709 --> 11:30.750
N-Ville has destroyed those
Flat-wads 11 years running

11:30.834 --> 11:33.041
and now we're about to
make it an even dozen.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.667
On your mark, get set.
Chess!

11:35.750 --> 11:37.166
-(both) Chess?
-Shhh!

11:37.250 --> 11:39.750
(timer ticking)

11:39.834 --> 11:41.583
(muffled coughing)

11:41.667 --> 11:45.208
(whispering) This is
the most boring week ever.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.750
(slurping)

11:46.834 --> 11:49.667
Oh, this is
the most boring week ever.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.709
No break-ups, no burn-outs,
no blunders.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.709
Everyone has been
disgustingly gloom-free.

11:55.792 --> 11:59.166
Fortunately,
McFist has assured me

11:59.250 --> 12:01.750
he has a plan guaranteed

12:01.834 --> 12:04.917
to crush the school's
school spirit.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.959
-(laughing)
-(squeaks)

12:07.041 --> 12:08.458
Look at them, Viceroy.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.792
Not a clue that we're about
to ruin their afternoon.

12:10.875 --> 12:11.917
-I love it!
-Shhh.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.291
You shush!

12:13.375 --> 12:16.041
I have to admit, sir.
Replacing the Flackville player

12:16.125 --> 12:17.750
with my unbeatable
Chess Bot 5000

12:17.834 --> 12:19.875
was a stroke of
above average for you.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.583
Your robot better be
as good as you say it is.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.750
Oh, he's good.

12:23.834 --> 12:26.625
He's been programmed with
every chess move ever played.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.417
-(sighs)
-(Randy) Am I missing something?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.375
How could our entire school
love this?

12:31.458 --> 12:34.250
Seriously. It's like
the easiest game ever.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.959
All he's got to do
is put the castle thingy

12:36.041 --> 12:37.709
next to the horsey thingy,

12:37.792 --> 12:39.750
and the guy in the pointy hat
can't do anything.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.083
I mean, am I the only one
who's seeing this?

12:42.166 --> 12:44.125
Howard, I know you
better than anyone,

12:44.208 --> 12:47.834
and you don't know
the first thing about chess.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.959
Look who's talking now?
Chess wing!

12:54.417 --> 12:56.458
Who are you?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.000
Whoo-hoo!

12:58.083 --> 13:00.250
-(McFist laughing)
-(Viceroy snickering)

13:00.333 --> 13:02.291
-McFist!
-(both giggling)

13:02.375 --> 13:04.792
Finally, some action.
Let's do this.

13:04.875 --> 13:08.750
Hooray! Go Norrisville!

13:08.834 --> 13:10.834
Oh, even my enemies
are boring.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.083
What are you doing?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.709
Pointy top jumps roundhead
and you got him!

13:14.792 --> 13:17.166
(groans)
This is ridiculous.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.750
I'll be in
the Ninja-nomicon.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.625
(grunts) Nomi-con.

13:23.709 --> 13:26.709
Please tell me you got
something exciting for me to do.

13:26.792 --> 13:29.083
I'm about to lose
my cheese out there.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.417
Huh?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.834
(exclaims)

13:31.917 --> 13:33.166
(gasping)

13:33.250 --> 13:34.792
Balls. Balls.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.083
Look at all
those beautiful balls.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.083
Another wahoo
bites the dust.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.333
Only one match stands
between the chess-bians

13:41.417 --> 13:43.291
and a record 12 wins.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.625
We so got this.
Debbie "Dominator" King

13:46.709 --> 13:48.792
is about to destroy...

13:48.875 --> 13:51.125
Huh? Steve Riley.

13:51.208 --> 13:56.542
Norrisville, prepare to feel
the wrath of Steve Riley!

13:56.625 --> 14:00.709
Any way you say it, it just
doesn't sound that scary.

14:00.792 --> 14:01.959
(mechanical whirring)

14:02.041 --> 14:03.875
(cracking knuckles)

14:03.959 --> 14:04.875
(timer ticking)

14:04.959 --> 14:06.792
(all gasping)

14:06.875 --> 14:08.917
(Randy chattering)

14:10.500 --> 14:13.166
Bowl it.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.750
In your face, turtle!

14:14.834 --> 14:18.709
I'm calling that one
"Ninja Hot Ball."

14:21.959 --> 14:25.208
Uh-oh!
Ninja Cold Balls.

14:25.291 --> 14:28.542
Nomicon, you know exactly
how to cheer me up.

14:28.625 --> 14:32.333
"To underestimate your enemy
is to invite your defeat."

14:32.417 --> 14:33.875
Underestimate enemy,
invite defeat.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.166
Cool, yeah,
just one question.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.208
What the juice do
these green ones do?

14:38.291 --> 14:40.125
-(sizzling)
-Whoa!

14:40.208 --> 14:42.834
Ninja Electro-Balls!

14:42.917 --> 14:44.667
(Riley) Checkmate.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.667
(shrieking)

14:45.750 --> 14:47.500
W. T. Juice.

14:47.583 --> 14:50.375
Dominator King was
our chess-sassinator.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.083
-Bum city.
-(all groaning)

15:11.250 --> 15:14.291
(all gasping)

15:14.375 --> 15:16.792
-Checkmate.
-(sobbing)

15:18.834 --> 15:20.583
(all sobbing)

15:22.041 --> 15:23.792
(all straining)

15:27.667 --> 15:29.417
-(giggling)
-Ahh!

15:29.500 --> 15:31.166
I can't believe it.
It worked.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.709
My plan worked!

15:32.792 --> 15:34.250
Who's the genius now,
Viceroy?

15:34.333 --> 15:35.625
Still me.

15:35.709 --> 15:37.417
All you had to do
was branch your pony

15:37.500 --> 15:39.834
two L's to the right,
and you would have had him!

15:39.917 --> 15:44.625
Why do I yell this stuff out
if nobody's gonna listen?!

15:44.709 --> 15:47.709
And what do you do?

15:50.291 --> 15:52.792
-(buzzing)
-Ah, bees!

15:52.875 --> 15:55.500
That's a Ninja Bee Ball.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.000
(shouting)

16:00.875 --> 16:03.709
"To underestimate your enemy
is to invite your defeat."

16:03.792 --> 16:05.834
That's great advice.
I'll keep that in mind.

16:05.917 --> 16:08.000
For when something's
actually happening.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.458
(thunder cracking)

16:09.542 --> 16:11.083
(shouting)

16:17.000 --> 16:19.083
(maniacal laughter)

16:30.792 --> 16:33.250
(screaming)

16:33.333 --> 16:34.834
(whimpering)

16:34.917 --> 16:37.542
Howard, you will not believe
what I just saw in the Nomicon.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.291
Uh, everyone was monstered out
in a epic stake apocalypse?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.792
No...
Yeah, how did you know?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.000
(all shouting)

16:49.500 --> 16:51.250
(girl screaming)

16:55.000 --> 16:57.875
Eh, what do you say we
watch from outside?

16:59.500 --> 17:02.125
(all whimpering)

17:02.208 --> 17:04.583
(roaring)

17:04.667 --> 17:06.792
Yeah, week's not so boring
now, is it, Cunningham?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.875
I can handle this.
No problem.

17:08.959 --> 17:10.792
Just gotta figure out
what to destroy,

17:10.875 --> 17:12.333
-so I can de-stank 'em.
-(Howard) Mm-hmm.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.166
(Randy) The trophy.
Gotta be it.

17:19.291 --> 17:22.000
Howard, it's Ninja o'clock.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.750
Ho, ho. It is way past
Ninja o'clock.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.625
I am awash in chaos.

17:28.709 --> 17:33.625
Each scream brings me
closer to freedom.

17:33.709 --> 17:34.667
(laughing)

17:34.750 --> 17:37.500
Smoke bomb!

17:37.583 --> 17:38.709
(exclaiming)

17:45.834 --> 17:46.917
Dancing fish.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.792
Why'd it have to be
dancing fish?

17:48.875 --> 17:51.000
(screaming)

17:51.083 --> 17:54.041
There's something
weird about you.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.625
Don't know what it is.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.959
But there is something
weird about you.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.959
Ninja Cold Balls!

18:04.542 --> 18:07.000
Looks like I put
your routine on ice.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.500
If you weren't frozen you totally
would have appreciated that.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.709
Ninja Electro-Balls!

18:14.709 --> 18:16.917
Ninja Bee Ball!

18:17.750 --> 18:19.000
(buzzing)

18:19.083 --> 18:20.875
Open up.
It's the Ninja.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.375
Forget it.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.291
Come on,
there's monsters out here!

18:24.375 --> 18:26.291
And bees.
A lot of bees.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.208
(Randy exclaiming)

18:28.291 --> 18:29.875
I need your trophy.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.208
But we won!

18:31.291 --> 18:32.834
And let me be the first
to congratulate you.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.500
You really did it.
Ninja Trophy Slash!

18:35.583 --> 18:37.875
I'm sorry I had to do that.

18:37.959 --> 18:39.834
But you'll understand
when I open this door,

18:39.917 --> 18:41.750
and everyone
has returned to normal.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.542
(all growling)

18:43.625 --> 18:45.250
-(grumbling)
-OK, this is bad.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.917
Just gonna wing it.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.625
(screaming)

18:50.750 --> 18:52.834
Huh?

18:52.917 --> 18:54.458
Got kinda a lot
going on here.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.291
(Howard) <i>I think I know</i>
<i>how Flackville won.</i>

18:56.375 --> 18:57.792
Uh-huh, yeah, OK.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.291
Steve Riley is
a chess-playing McFist-bot

19:00.375 --> 19:01.750
designed to beat
Norrisville. Mm-hmm.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.333
Which bummed everyone out,

19:03.417 --> 19:07.166
allowing the Sorcerer
to stank them. Wow.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.417
That is a serious plan.
Hold on one second.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.750
And I'm back.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.917
So the slashing the trophy?
Big, fat goose egg.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.709
-(shrieking)
-Ninja Slipping Balls.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.750
How are you gonna
de-stank the school?

19:21.834 --> 19:23.709
Everyone thought
Norrisville couldn't lose.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.667
We underestimated our enemy.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.417
When we lost,
everyone got stanked.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.709
So to de-stank,
we have to win.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.875
Howard, we have
to beat Flackville.

19:32.959 --> 19:33.875
I'll do it.

19:33.959 --> 19:35.792
But all of our players
are monsters.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.834
Uh, hello.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.709
I totally get
this dumb game.

19:38.792 --> 19:41.041
Yes, that's it!
That guy can play.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.333
-Hey, buddy.
-(roaring)

19:42.417 --> 19:44.709
No, he's a monster.
That's a monster too.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.291
Tell you what.
You fight that thing,

19:47.375 --> 19:48.583
I'll go save the school.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.375
Hey, Steve.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.083
Your move.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.917
(grunting)

20:08.750 --> 20:10.625
Hey, where you going?

20:10.709 --> 20:11.875
Howard?

20:23.542 --> 20:26.125
Anybody here know what's happening?
'Cause I don't get this game at all.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.917
-(both) Shhh!
-(sizzling)

20:28.000 --> 20:29.250
Why is your robot sweating?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.041
That boy's playing
crazy chess.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.709
Chess Bot isn't
programmed for that.

20:33.750 --> 20:34.834
Ha!

20:34.917 --> 20:37.959
Oh, you took my pointy
diagonal guy.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.709
Uh, but you totally missed
my only-can-go-straight guy.

20:41.792 --> 20:42.792
Chess mate!

20:42.875 --> 20:44.542
You mean, checkmate!

20:44.625 --> 20:46.125
Yeah, whatever.
I win!

20:46.208 --> 20:48.083
(all cheering)

20:48.166 --> 20:51.041
(all chanting) Howard!

20:56.375 --> 20:58.875
(Randy) Ninja Hot Balls!

21:00.917 --> 21:03.834
It's not a big deal.
It's what I do, I'm a Ninja.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.959
Seriously? I had like,
two seconds of glory.

21:07.041 --> 21:10.000
And you earned it.
Smoke bomb.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.333
No. No!

21:19.417 --> 21:21.166
(shouting) No!

21:22.583 --> 21:25.375
I underestimated my enemy,
and he would have defeated me,

21:25.458 --> 21:26.667
if it wasn't for you.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.875
Wow.
That is an ugly trophy.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.208
Hey, kid.
You saved the day.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.083
No. We saved the day.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.709
(gasps) And why do you
get the bigger half?

21:37.792 --> 21:39.208
Because I saved the day more.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.667
The juice you did!

21:40.750 --> 21:42.000
The juice I didn't!

21:42.083 --> 21:45.333
(both arguing)

21:48.583 --> 21:51.208
(theme music playing)
