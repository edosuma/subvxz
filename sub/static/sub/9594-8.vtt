00:29.463 --> 00:32.166
What are you looking at,
old man?

00:32.266 --> 00:36.204
Ha-ha. He's so old.

00:38.239 --> 00:42.176
BOY:  Help me!

01:00.594 --> 01:01.829
ROBIN: Mad Mod!

01:02.996 --> 01:05.199
Stealing the most precious
thing in this world, youth.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.234
How could you?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.536
Yeah, you made 'em so wrinkly!

01:08.636 --> 01:09.770
BEAST BOY: So spotty!

01:09.870 --> 01:12.540
So hunched.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.408
So cute.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.111
Oh, look at these
little scamps.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.612
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

01:20.414 --> 01:22.082
Are you done?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.784
Mwah!

01:23.884 --> 01:25.353
I love old people.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.288
Titans, go!

02:12.666 --> 02:13.901
-Raven!

02:15.035 --> 02:16.404
Grab that cane before he can
turn us into old people!

02:17.705 --> 02:18.706
Oops.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.277
ALL: No!

02:24.044 --> 02:25.246
No, don't do it.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.681
Don't turn them into
the cutest thing ever.

02:49.437 --> 02:54.208
We have to track down
Mod before we're stuck
as old people forever.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.614
Say again?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.456
You're gonna have to speak up.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.659
-I am having trouble hearing!

03:12.860 --> 03:15.863
This is so precious.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.232
Titans...

03:18.332 --> 03:20.334
We have to get our youth back.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.804
Yes, my face is drooping
and sagging.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.674
No, no, no. You don't want
to be young again.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.310
That's easy for you to say,
hot stuff.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.445
You're still young
and beautiful.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.980
Okay, dial it back, grandpa.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.348
Being old is great.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.384
Just look at Robin's
gray streaks.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.786
Ooh. I do look distinguished.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.221
-Cyborg, check
your wallet out.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.959
CYBORG: Are these pictures
of my grandbabies?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.262
One of the perks
of getting older.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.598
Where did the grandbabies
come from?

03:50.698 --> 03:53.334
-Nobody knows.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.940
And the best part is,
with age, comes wisdom.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.512
Wisdom!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.880
Maybe we should give
being old a try.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.248
That's the spirit.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.484
Now, everyone gather around.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.654
Oh, I love you,
my little prunes.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.888
-Mwah!
-Ooh.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.256
Mwah!

04:16.357 --> 04:17.558
Mwah!

04:17.658 --> 04:19.026
Mwah!

04:19.126 --> 04:21.495
This is a dream come true.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.868
Did... Did I ever tell you how
I got this watch?

04:29.069 --> 04:31.271
I was stationed in France.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.412
So he says to me,
"That ain't your watch."

04:38.512 --> 04:41.415
So, I says... I says to him,

04:41.515 --> 04:44.284
"I found it,
so it makes it my watch."

04:46.019 --> 04:47.287
Come here, little scamp.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.822
Denitrious,
get away from there.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.859
He ended up in prison for life

04:51.959 --> 04:55.763
and I'm still wearing
the watch.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.335
Charming stories, slow dances,

05:01.435 --> 05:02.836
grandbabies.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.573
Ah, you salty codgers.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.749
The Tower's never
been this quiet.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.818
Hey, where's Beast Boy?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.820
He's in the bowl.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.855
Think you could tell me
that watch story again?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.460
Beast Boy?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.328
Is he sleeping?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.632
No, hon, he passed.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.866
He's dead?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.001
Mmm-mmm.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.370
Passed.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.539
How? I don't understand.

05:38.639 --> 05:42.476
It was just his time, dear.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.713
That really puts things
in perspective.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.081
I'm going to make the most out
of every precious moment

05:48.181 --> 05:49.617
I have left with you guys.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.885
Oh, that's nice, dear.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.560
RAVEN: Old people are
like shooting stars.

05:59.660 --> 06:04.498
They shine bright, but are
gone in an instant.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.600
Rest in peace,
you salty codgers.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.513
The Tower's never
been this quiet.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.824
I miss Grandpa.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.799
I have to get them back!
And there's only one way!

06:41.502 --> 06:43.871
To resurrect the Titans,
you will have to journey

06:43.971 --> 06:46.774
into the underworld,
cross the Black River

06:46.874 --> 06:50.444
and finally look into
the eyes of Death himself.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.045
BOY: I have to?

06:52.145 --> 06:56.884
I don't want to look into
the eyes of Death.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.887
Sorry, I'm used to telling
these stories to other people.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.889
This time, it's my job.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.514
The price of passage be
two dead man's coins.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.750
Dead man's coins.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.118
Uh, no.

07:32.419 --> 07:35.122
Then ye shall rot on
the black shores of
the river for eternity!

07:35.222 --> 07:37.190
And your bones will be...

07:37.290 --> 07:38.926
Wait! Where are ya going?

07:39.026 --> 07:41.128
I don't need a ride,
but thanks.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.763
Okay, okay.

07:42.863 --> 07:46.466
One dead man's coin,
but I won't go any lower.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.968
-RAVEN: I'm good.
-Oh.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.604
BIRD:
Dead man's coins!

08:00.881 --> 08:03.651
(GHOSTLY VOICES
WARBLING IN DISTANCE)

08:13.627 --> 08:15.095
Raven!

08:16.029 --> 08:17.631
I've been expecting you.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.533
Come give your
Uncle Death a hug.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.201
Then you know what
I'm here for.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.671
'Course I do! Souls!

08:23.771 --> 08:27.541
Shortening the lives of
your friends for your own
selfish desires.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.711
So very evil, Raven. Ha!
I love it.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.946
They were so cute
as old people.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.047
I know, I know!

08:34.147 --> 08:36.016
Don't you just love
the big ears?

08:36.116 --> 08:39.086
And their noses.
They never stop growing.
Did you know that?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.520
I did indeed.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.858
But, uh,
we're getting off track.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.295
You see, Raven,
you had your fun
with them old folks.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.030
But they're mine now.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.566
* Once they took
their last breath

08:52.666 --> 08:54.968
* I'm a soul collector, baby

08:55.068 --> 08:56.203
* I'm Death!

08:56.303 --> 08:58.005
* They're all mine

08:58.105 --> 08:59.807
* Yeah, last breath!

08:59.907 --> 09:02.242
* I'm a soul collector, baby

09:02.342 --> 09:03.577
* I'm Death!

09:03.677 --> 09:05.278
* So, come on

09:05.378 --> 09:06.680
* Whoo!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.088
* Don't stop now!

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
* Come on!

09:23.030 --> 09:25.733
So, here's the deal.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.669
You trade me
your soul for theirs.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.605
ALL: Don't do it, Raven!

09:31.705 --> 09:33.073
Okay.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.608
Really? Oh.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.876
Then it's a deal!

09:36.844 --> 09:39.246
First, you give me
my friends back.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.748
Ah, don't trust Death, do you?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.182
Ah, I don't blame you.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.717
Here they are.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.289
And now, for your soul.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.158
Yeah, about that.
Don't have one!

09:51.258 --> 09:52.660
I'm half demon.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.894
You tricked me!

09:53.994 --> 09:55.963
And I don't feel bad
about it, either.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.800
There's always a price when
you deal with Death.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.236
Is that price free?
'Cause I just paid it.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.738
See you, sucker!

10:05.706 --> 10:07.975
Raven!

10:17.250 --> 10:19.653
Guys, is that you?

10:20.854 --> 10:24.958
BEAST BOY: Watch! Watch!

10:25.058 --> 10:28.028
This must be the price
Death spoke of.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.033
Now they're old and undead?

10:33.801 --> 10:35.635
My two favorite things!

10:35.736 --> 10:37.037
Oh. Mwah!

10:37.137 --> 10:39.039
Mwah! Mwah!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.041
Mwah!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.042
Watch.
