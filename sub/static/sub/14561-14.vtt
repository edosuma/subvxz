WEBVTT

00:13.547 --> 00:14.748
Hey, Charlie.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.217
How about a game?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.718
Uh, no. Uh, I've got to finish

00:17.751 --> 00:19.620
- grading papers.
- Oh, I can wait.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.023
Or maybe not.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.759
ALAN: Hey, Amita,
how about a...

00:25.793 --> 00:26.894
Hmm? Not now.

00:26.927 --> 00:27.928
- The show's starting.
- What do you mean, starting?

00:27.961 --> 00:28.762
You've been camped out there
for over an hour.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.430
No, no, no.
That was the preshow.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.599
Now the actual awards start.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.533
ANNOUNCER: Live from
Downtown Los Angeles...

00:32.566 --> 00:34.068
- Hey.
- What's the score?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.603
Uh, it's just starting.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.770
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the Sixth Annual

00:36.804 --> 00:38.406
Cinema and Television...

00:38.439 --> 00:39.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:39.507 --> 00:41.142
CHARLIE:
Um, I'm recording the game.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.843
We're going to watch it
after Amita watches her show.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.812
- I'll be done by then.
- But I left work early

00:44.845 --> 00:45.746
for this.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.415
ALAN: Hey, Donnie,
Donnie, how about a game

00:47.448 --> 00:48.349
of chess in the meantime?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
Oh, come on, Don,
watch the show with me.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.852
This is much more entertaining
than hockey. Trust me.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.854
...supporting actor award
for a motion picture performance

00:53.887 --> 00:55.289
is last year's winner

00:55.323 --> 00:57.458
and costar
of the soon to be released

00:57.491 --> 00:58.792
Deadline for Tomorrow,

00:58.826 --> 01:01.629
Miss Scarlet McBain.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.531
(audience clapping)

01:03.564 --> 01:04.765
Thank you.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.801
It was my honor
to win this award last year,

01:07.835 --> 01:10.371
and I look forward
to winning it again next year.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.739
What is this?
What are we watching?

01:11.772 --> 01:12.840
AMITA:
Come on, you guys just need

01:12.873 --> 01:15.143
to get to know
the players, okay?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.144
The presenter is Scarlet McBain.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.211
She's Гјber-talented,

01:17.245 --> 01:18.846
but she had this whole DUI thing
happen last month

01:18.879 --> 01:20.781
where she blew a .18

01:20.814 --> 01:22.350
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.384
- Oh, well...
- Yeah.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.386
Check out that dress.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.456
AMITA:
Look at that diamond necklace.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.724
- I'm black.
- Ah, now you're talking.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.161
Marcella Nico for RisquГ© Living.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.296
Courtney Hollis for Love...

01:36.830 --> 01:37.865
Mmm! Charlie!

01:37.898 --> 01:39.867
- CHARLIE: What?
- AMITA: The TV.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.869
Uh, it's the cable.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.671
There's a...
there's an intermittent

01:43.704 --> 01:45.573
where it hooks up in the garage.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.375
I know.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.478
- I'll go fix it.
- Thank you.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.189
(clattering)

02:01.222 --> 02:02.490
(rustling, loud breathing)

02:04.325 --> 02:06.727
Is somebody in here?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.548
(Charlie yelling)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.584
Hello, Charles.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.786
Larry?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.956
What... what are you doing here?

02:35.989 --> 02:40.894
Uh, well, given
the general detritus, the tent,

02:40.928 --> 02:43.264
I'd say the answer
is fairly obvious.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.267
I've been squatting.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.939
My assistant, Debbie Porter,
and... who, you know,

02:51.972 --> 02:53.807
keeps my life from spinning
out of control.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.742
All right.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.777
And, um, oh, my therapist,
Ronda Van Gant

02:56.810 --> 02:58.712
who keeps my life
on an even keel--

02:58.746 --> 03:02.250
and should for $300 an hour.
(people coughing over TV)

03:02.283 --> 03:03.116
You guys, check this out.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.253
Um... oh, my accountant,
Stan Waterford,

03:05.286 --> 03:09.290
and... and my personal trainer,
Oki... (coughs)

03:09.323 --> 03:10.524
Is this part of the show?

03:10.558 --> 03:11.725
MAN:
Fire!

03:11.759 --> 03:13.894
Fire!
(people screaming)

03:13.927 --> 03:15.863
MAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:15.896 --> 03:18.699
please proceed in an orderly
fashion to the exits

03:18.732 --> 03:20.734
at the rear of the theater.
(phone ringing)

03:20.768 --> 03:22.303
Please stay calm,
and follow the instructions

03:22.336 --> 03:23.504
- of the ushers
- Yeah. Hey.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.573
- and security personnel.
- DON: I'm actually watching it.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.476
I mean, I'm-I'm not...
Amita's got it on here.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.977
DON:
Yeah. Right.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.480
Okay. I'm on my way.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.781
- What happened?
- I don't know.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.483
They just...
they want to rule out terrorism.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.784
Um...

03:36.817 --> 03:38.819
knight to bishop three.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.654
That's checkmate, pal.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.723
I'll see you guys later.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.331
NIKKI:
Okay, there were no explosions,

03:50.364 --> 03:53.801
and LAFD hasn't found
any evidence of an actual fire.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.902
Only injuries
are people who were hurt

03:54.935 --> 03:55.936
in the stampede to get out
of there.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.004
Right.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.739
Agents, can you comment on what
happened tonight?

03:58.772 --> 03:59.840
Sorry.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.342
Hey, uh, we don't know
anything yet. Thanks a lot.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.710
Don, EOD found a dozen of these.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.345
Definitely not part of the show.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.980
It's a radio-activated
smoke bomb.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.249
Very sophisticated,
placed in just the right spots.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.023
Are-are you really
from the FBI,

04:16.056 --> 04:17.991
or is that jacket from wardrobe?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.059
No, it's all real.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.528
Oh, good.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.364
Someone just yanked
a $300,000 necklace

04:23.397 --> 04:24.565
just right off of me.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.035
By the time I turned around
to fight them--

04:28.068 --> 04:32.306
and I am a certified black belt
in Brazilian jujitsu--

04:32.340 --> 04:34.675
but the smoke was so thick
I couldn't see,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.010
- uh, who did it.
- And what did they get?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.079
It was a large purple stone
to match my gown

04:39.112 --> 04:40.013
and earrings that...

04:40.047 --> 04:42.049
do you want me to draw
a picture of them?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.784
They got four gold chains

04:43.817 --> 04:46.420
and, of course... the ring.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.055
Custom-made, 24 carat,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.923
platinum inlay
and about three dozen diamonds.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.426
- Size?
- About, uh...

04:52.460 --> 04:54.495
three inches.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.065
It's a ponytail ring.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.468
Have you never seen
any of my movies?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.102
Oh, sure.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.805
Yeah, mostly the old ones,
you know, before you got...

05:04.838 --> 05:07.875
What, before I got...
before I got fat?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.078
Anything else taken?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.383
My ponytail.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.891
Just talked to LAPD.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.426
They got over
a dozen celebrities

05:25.459 --> 05:26.560
reporting stolen jewelry.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.528
Yeah, smoke bombs

05:27.561 --> 05:29.763
were a cover
for a grab-and-go jewelry heist.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.635
A striking addition
of two plus two.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.071
Elizabeth Hopkins,
Lloyd's of London.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.206
London. What kind of plane

05:39.239 --> 05:41.942
- did they put you on?
- Oh, I was inside the theater

05:41.975 --> 05:43.577
watching over the jewelry
my company insures.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.679
And you watched it
walk out the door.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.047
Oh, touchГ©.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.082
One bitchy remark
does deserve another.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.084
You're going to need my help

05:51.118 --> 05:52.019
dealing with these people.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.655
They're actors.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.890
Hey!

05:56.924 --> 05:59.393
Hey! Give me that!

05:59.427 --> 06:00.661
Give me that camera!

06:00.694 --> 06:02.430
Victims are all gathered up

06:02.463 --> 06:04.031
and giving us drink orders
while they wait.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.735
WOMAN: Officer, could you
call my nanny and tell her

06:07.768 --> 06:09.437
to put my son, Ionesco, to bed?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.638
MAN: Hey!

06:10.671 --> 06:12.105
I'm going to kill you!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.442
- And then I'm going to sue you!
- Welcome to the circus.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.676
(grunts)

06:26.920 --> 06:28.055
WOMAN:
The suffocating smoke,

06:28.088 --> 06:31.759
people pushing and shoving
like I was a below-the-line.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.828
I mean, I thought I was
seriously going to die.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.431
Okay. Well,
I think I have everything.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.733
I'm just going to need
to get your name.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.202
(laughs)

06:42.235 --> 06:43.837
Is that your way
of asking for an autograph?

06:45.172 --> 06:47.107
Uh... no.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.811
"We'll meet again.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.446
"Perhaps not in this world,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.182
"but we will find each other,

06:55.215 --> 06:57.818
because love never dies."

07:00.588 --> 07:02.422
Regina Landers.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.659
But you knew that.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.661
Right?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.863
Right.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.932
It's an eight-figure heist
with 20 million people watching,

07:11.965 --> 07:13.534
and we really
only have one witness?

07:13.567 --> 07:16.103
Only took seconds for the place
to fill with smoke.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.638
You know, someone yells fire,

07:17.671 --> 07:19.172
creates the perfect cover
to grab jewelry.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.708
How many got hit?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.643
16, all A-list celebrities.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.478
You know, weird thing is,
a lot of them

07:24.512 --> 07:25.913
seem clueless
as to what they lost.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.815
ELIZABETH:
Well, in addition to being

07:27.848 --> 07:29.049
generally clueless,

07:29.082 --> 07:31.184
they probably didn't own
what they lost.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.587
A lot of the stars
wear borrowed jewelry.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.888
Their stylists select the pieces

07:34.922 --> 07:36.690
from high-end dealers
on Rodeo Drive.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.526
They may not see
what they're wearing

07:38.559 --> 07:39.693
until right before the event.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.862
And all this security here--
I mean, how did these guys

07:41.895 --> 07:42.730
get in?

07:42.763 --> 07:43.631
NIKKI: I'll go talk to the
director.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.933
Why don't you two
try to put together

07:45.966 --> 07:47.568
a detailed list
of everything taken.

07:50.638 --> 07:51.872
Yeah.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.941
(David clears throat)

08:00.247 --> 08:01.915
LARRY:
I apologize.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.885
I probably should
have asked permission

08:04.918 --> 08:06.620
before setting up residence
in your garage.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.822
I don't know.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.760
I just needed a slower reentry
into society.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.762
'Cause I have been leading

08:14.795 --> 08:16.997
a rather solitary existence
of late.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.700
Uh, I'm sorry, Larry, but...

08:19.733 --> 08:21.168
where the hell have you been?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.236
AMITA: I'm guessing
from your new look

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
that you didn't end up
in Italy.

08:24.972 --> 08:25.839
(Larry chuckles)

08:25.873 --> 08:28.241
Nor Greece, nor Alaska,

08:28.275 --> 08:31.178
nor any of the destinations
that I'd chosen.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.281
Surely, somewhere without
a phone or postal system,

08:34.314 --> 08:36.684
since we didn't hear
word one from you.

08:36.717 --> 08:41.889
No. Serendipity placed me
in the Mojave Desert,

08:41.922 --> 08:43.857
just about 150 miles from here.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.060
Pristine night skies.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.963
Minimal light pollution.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.033
Crystalline seasonal
constellations.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.168
Did you find
what you were looking for?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.308
Yes.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.879
And?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.617
Do you happen to have
any shaved Parmesan?

09:12.152 --> 09:14.922
So, the show
was moving along fine.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.657
I mean, we were actually running

09:16.690 --> 09:18.058
a little short,
which was a first.

09:18.091 --> 09:22.295
Then, suddenly,
all this smoke and screaming,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.031
and the wonderful sound
of my directing career

09:24.064 --> 09:25.899
going right down the toilet.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.034
- How many cameras were going?
- Eight.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.136
But none of the footage
is better than this, because,

09:29.169 --> 09:30.804
once the smoke started,
you couldn't see anything.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.039
We're still going to need
to see them.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.774
COLBY:
What about the security?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.008
This is supposed to be
a closed event, right?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.076
Yeah, supposed to be.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.210
I mean, everybody--

09:37.244 --> 09:38.245
audience, crew--
they're on a list.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.847
No way in if you're not on it.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.715
What, are you going to want
to see that, too?

09:41.749 --> 09:42.816
These guys got in somehow,
right?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.652
I don't know--
I mean, maybe, like,

09:44.685 --> 09:45.819
a P.A. or a writer.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.755
They're always
complaining about money.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.356
- What's that?
- Check this out.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.991
It's an interactive
seating chart, okay?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.393
Yellow squares-- that's what
we call camera candy.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.962
Hot actors, reality stars.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.998
You know, the people you want
to tune in to, to see.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.199
Then, the red squares-- well,

09:59.232 --> 10:00.701
let's just say that you
would recognize them

10:00.734 --> 10:01.935
if you've been
to dinner theater recently.

10:01.969 --> 10:02.803
Then, the blue squares

10:02.836 --> 10:04.404
are the people
that we have to invite,

10:04.437 --> 10:05.773
but we don't want to invite.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.940
Like agents,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.642
agents and agents.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.978
All right, I'm going to need
a copy of that, too.

10:11.011 --> 10:11.879
How is a seating chart going
to help you?

10:11.912 --> 10:12.946
I don't know.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.748
But the rule of thumb is,
if something reminds me

10:14.782 --> 10:15.816
of my tenth grade
geometry class,

10:15.849 --> 10:17.718
then we can probably use it
to solve the crime.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.322
DAVID:
47 pieces

10:22.355 --> 10:24.157
of stolen jewelry.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.293
We insured this piece.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.295
42 carats, total weight.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.362
Value: million and a quarter.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.164
Seriously?

10:31.198 --> 10:32.432
Mm-hmm.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.867
Now, you walk around
wearing that,

10:33.901 --> 10:35.268
you deserve to be robbed.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.270
Is that the FBI's
official position

10:37.304 --> 10:38.806
or a personal insight?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.108
My personal insight
is there are better things

10:41.141 --> 10:43.276
people can be doing
with their money,

10:43.310 --> 10:46.279
and much better things
I could be doing with my time.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.816
Ah, the moral certainty
of reverse snobbery.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.718
The wealthier the victim,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.285
the less deserving of justice?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.721
I didn't say that at all.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.322
NIKKI:
Scored the guest list.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.857
Everyone who was inside

10:56.890 --> 10:57.958
when the heist went down.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.159
And we also
have local news stations

10:59.192 --> 11:01.729
sending over all their footage
of the crowd running out.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.431
Bad guy's got to be in there
somewhere, right?

11:04.464 --> 11:07.134
The only problem is, we don't
know who we're looking for.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.403
Ah, what goes better
with a Glock--

11:10.437 --> 11:11.772
emeralds or rubies?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.040
Rubies.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.307
Emeralds are for hand grenades.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.911
Opals for switchblades.
(Nikki laughs)

11:17.945 --> 11:19.212
She seems kind of cool.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.981
Cool? Aah.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.816
Cold is more like it.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.785
Ew. You like her.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.453
No.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.888
(phone ringing)

11:27.921 --> 11:29.456
Oh. Betancourt.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.225
Look, the answer

11:32.259 --> 11:34.394
to the first question
is we're working on it.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.428
The answer
to the second question is,

11:35.462 --> 11:36.730
it's not going to happen.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.266
(sighs)

11:39.299 --> 11:40.533
Sven Regal.

11:40.567 --> 11:44.471
He keeps calling me to see if we
got any leads on his ponytail.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.472
Oh.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.040
And the second question?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.344
He likes you.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.080
(laughs)

11:54.547 --> 11:56.149
Hey. How we doing?

11:56.183 --> 11:57.751
Uh, doing an inventory,

11:57.785 --> 11:59.987
running down a list of,
uh, attendees.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.889
This call came
while you were upstairs.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.991
From the warden at San Quentin.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.993
Said you'd want
to know about it.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.527
Oh, yeah.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.661
That name look familiar?

12:08.695 --> 12:12.499
I helped bust him, uh,
something like ten years ago,

12:12.532 --> 12:15.969
and he tried to appeal
a zillion times.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.405
One of those cases
that just wouldn't die, huh?

12:18.438 --> 12:19.840
Yeah.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.109
I guess it's dead now.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.249
COLBY:
As far as we can tell,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.218
the victims were robbed
at roughly the same time.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.253
- So, multiple thieves.
- COLBY: So, I'm wondering--

12:33.286 --> 12:34.487
do you think we can use this

12:34.521 --> 12:35.288
to figure out
how many there were

12:35.322 --> 12:37.791
and where they were?
(door opens)

12:37.825 --> 12:39.359
- Hey.
- COLBY: Larry.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.561
Oh, you're back.
Hey, you look, uh...

12:41.594 --> 12:44.131
- Refreshed?
- Yeah.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.498
So, what's the case du jour
here?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.434
Oh, the chase.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.036
One of the things
I missed most dearly.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.304
That and shaving, evidently.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.405
(laughs)

12:52.439 --> 12:53.907
Hey, Larry.
What happened?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.976
I thought you came in
to get the chessboard.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.850
Retrograde analysis.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.851
A-a simple matter

13:03.884 --> 13:05.853
of finding a fixed point

13:05.886 --> 13:07.454
where a thief could be stationed

13:07.487 --> 13:11.058
to maximize efficiency
in intercepting his victims.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.461
I need to see the theater.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.233
AMITA: Wow. So much smaller
than it looks on TV.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.970
You know, this is the exact seat
where Rachel Hollander sat.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.171
LARRY:
Yeah, I'm slightly

13:24.204 --> 13:26.606
discomfited
by this starstruck component

13:26.639 --> 13:28.441
of your personality.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.544
Well, love me,
love my US Weekly.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.513
Five feet, two inches.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.048
And by the way, you know,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.850
- I'm not going to do it.
- LARRY: Do what?

13:36.884 --> 13:38.485
Not going to go blue in the face

13:38.518 --> 13:40.888
trying to penetrate
the latest Fleinhardt mystery.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.089
I'm not trying
to generate any mystery.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.490
Just enjoying the adrenaline
of this one.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.058
Not to mention,

13:45.092 --> 13:48.929
it's nice having conversation
of a non-canine nature.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.530
You were talking to dogs?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.065
Uh, coyotes.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.168
They didn't talk back.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.105
Hi.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.173
Good morning.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.541
Is this, uh, going to take long?

14:01.574 --> 14:03.610
'Cause I got a big meeting
at the network.

14:03.643 --> 14:07.280
Turns out that the, uh, awards
show got monster ratings, so...

14:07.314 --> 14:09.449
Next year, maybe you
can blow up the theater.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.152
So, these are the seats
where the victims were sitting.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.154
We used them as epicenters.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.555
And I input their descriptions

14:15.588 --> 14:16.990
of the attacks.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.591
Then I calculated
the seating position

14:18.625 --> 14:21.228
from which each thief
could have optimized

14:21.261 --> 14:23.263
his or her stealing opportunity.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.664
The thieves began here

14:24.697 --> 14:26.499
in these six seats.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.635
OLIVER:
Yeah. So?

14:28.668 --> 14:31.571
Well, according
to your seating chart...

14:32.705 --> 14:34.574
Right, okay.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.244
Bruce, Keanu, Angelina.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.212
Uh, no, this isn't...
no, this isn't right.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.948
No kidding.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.482
The thieves were in these seats.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.484
Maybe, but Bruce, Keanu

14:44.517 --> 14:45.652
and Angelina were not.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.522
NIKKI:
So, who the hell was?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.065
What the hell is a seat filler?

14:58.098 --> 15:01.401
The theater always has
to be full, okay?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.403
There's nothing worse
on TV than a

15:03.436 --> 15:04.404
half-empty awards show.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.306
- Except an awards show.
- Hey!

15:06.339 --> 15:09.409
Fillers are warm bodies
that we put into the seats

15:09.442 --> 15:11.011
when the stars aren't in them.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.212
During the event,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.381
actors are called on stage
to present.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.216
And it's a very, very long show.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.584
- Bathroom breaks?
- Smoke breaks.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.385
Something else breaks.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.352
As long
as they come back upright.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.620
Well, you didn't give us
a seat filler list.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.356
'Cause I don't have one. We get
it from a private contractor.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.192
Her name is Paula Watson.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
Really hard to believe

15:29.362 --> 15:32.132
anyone I hired would be involved
in any of this.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.133
And why is that?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.234
These are geeks and wannabes

15:34.267 --> 15:36.069
with pretty faces.
I scare them up

15:36.103 --> 15:38.438
at campuses,
coffee shops, clubs.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.507
They're the kind of kids who
work for 65 bucks and a chance

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
to pretend they're going
to be famous someday.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.211
Well, we're gonna need names
to go with these pretty faces.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.312
I'm pretty busy right now.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.247
I've got the Syn-Can Awards
tomorrow night and...

15:48.415 --> 15:51.118
Syndicated Canadian TV.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
Okay.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.289
I'm looking.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.626
So, who decides
which ass goes in which seat?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.094
Hmm?

16:01.128 --> 16:04.331
Uh, well, I coordinate
with the, uh,

16:04.364 --> 16:05.465
director,
but it's pretty random.

16:05.498 --> 16:09.402
A seat's open, I grab
whoever's standing around. Ah.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.308
Is that blood?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.478
Mmm. Jelly doughnut.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.648
Hey, it's not the VMAs.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.651
COLBY: So, David and the
insurance investigator

16:24.684 --> 16:26.419
inventoried
all the stolen jewelry,

16:26.453 --> 16:29.289
and it turns out a lot of it
was from one place.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.791
A Beverly Hills jeweler--
Hans Stollbach.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.061
So, what, they're thinking
insurance fraud?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.295
COLBY:
Checking into it.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.330
Yeah. And we're also
taking another look

16:37.364 --> 16:38.798
at the footage
from the show, figuring now

16:38.831 --> 16:40.267
we know where
the guys were seated,

16:40.300 --> 16:41.434
maybe we can find a face.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.402
Yeah. And?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.104
Well, as you can see, the smoke

16:44.137 --> 16:46.473
is definitely a problem.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.142
Hey, can you do me a favor
and give me a lift somewhere?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.444
Yeah, sure. Where?

16:51.478 --> 16:52.779
Uh, over
to the evidence warehouse.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.182
You know, the parking there
is a nightmare.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.417
(horn honks)

17:01.188 --> 17:03.123
DAVID:
Hans Stollbach?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.557
ELIZABETH:
Of course it's Hans.

17:04.591 --> 17:05.658
No one else looks

17:05.692 --> 17:07.560
this good without trying.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.028
Always a pleasure.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.499
- Trainee?
- FBI.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.700
ELIZABETH:
He's taken a very

17:13.733 --> 17:15.468
passionate and personal concern

17:15.502 --> 17:18.138
with the Cinema and Television
Select Awards theft.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.373
Most of the stolen jewelry
came from your store.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.774
My jewelry
is the most sought-after

17:21.808 --> 17:24.411
for these events,
so that's no surprise.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.778
Of course, the insurance

17:25.812 --> 17:28.248
payoff won't even begin
to cover my losses.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.450
- And how is that?
- Ms. Hopkins must have told you

17:30.483 --> 17:32.585
that almost all
of the pieces I loaned out

17:32.619 --> 17:35.255
were appraised at about half
their current market value.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.623
Must have slipped her mind.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.857
Serves me right for leaving

17:37.890 --> 17:40.793
my idiot nephew in charge of
updating inventory valuations.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.262
He's not working here anymore.

17:42.295 --> 17:42.995
Mmm.

17:43.029 --> 17:43.796
Well, even half
of $20 million--

17:43.830 --> 17:44.964
I mean, that's still...
you know,

17:44.997 --> 17:46.799
- that's some serious money.
- If I were going to risk

17:46.833 --> 17:49.436
going to prison,
I wouldn't do it at a discount.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.237
(chuckles)

17:50.270 --> 17:51.704
I'll need copies of your
paperwork.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.540
Of course.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.343
(David clears throat)

17:56.376 --> 17:58.578
I wanted to see how he'd react.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.415
And possibly get back at you
for souring my day.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.450
Me?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.185
Halfway through
air-kissing Hans,

18:05.218 --> 18:06.753
I could just about
hear you thinking,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.521
"Two vacant rich people

18:08.555 --> 18:10.490
"fretting about pointlessly

18:10.523 --> 18:12.392
pretty rocks and metal."

18:12.425 --> 18:13.793
I didn't... I didn't...

18:15.395 --> 18:16.563
Okay.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.498
You know, I grew up in Brixton.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.599
My mom was a bookkeeper.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.268
My dad owned a small chemist.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.604
And the kids-- my friends--
were always stealing stuff.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.806
They figured he owned a store,
he had to be rich,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.608
it didn't matter.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.676
But the reality is,

18:29.709 --> 18:32.345
is that everyone's always richer
than someone else.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.347
So I believe

18:34.381 --> 18:36.349
everyone's loss matters.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.787
Well, I grew up
in the South Bronx, and, um,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.689
I was the kid stealing
the candy.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.357
So,

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
I'm sorry about that.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.562
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you...

18:49.596 --> 18:50.730
You know,
I thought an application

18:50.763 --> 18:52.232
of image reconstruction

18:52.265 --> 18:54.667
would do the trick,
but the smoke's too dense.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.236
Can we play this again?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.937
- Oh, you got something?
- LARRY: No. I just

18:57.970 --> 19:00.540
find her speech compelling.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.542
Her sad yearning
for connection.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.314
What's all this stuff?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.482
News footage from the crowd.
Why?

19:09.516 --> 19:10.450
Masses exiting.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.620
- Crowd flux dynamics.
- Yeah.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.954
And I picture...?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.656
The Colosseum.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.658
In Roman times,
engineers studied

19:18.691 --> 19:20.493
how people exit large venues.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.562
They tend to exit
in predictable ways.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.664
If we know
the person's seat location

19:24.697 --> 19:26.266
and the floor plan of the venue,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.868
we can calculate their likely
route and exit speed

19:28.901 --> 19:31.671
to predict
where they'll end up outside.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
We may not have useable footage

19:32.972 --> 19:34.574
of our thieves
inside the theater,

19:34.607 --> 19:35.542
but we have video of them

19:35.575 --> 19:37.677
outside the theater,
somewhere in the crowd.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.712
And we know
their seat locations,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.481
their starting points.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.949
So, all we really need to do

19:42.982 --> 19:44.251
is identify one face exiting.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.652
LARRY:
So, he becomes our key.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.487
Calculate his route
and rate of exit,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.989
and use that to find the others.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.325
Yeah. I really did miss this.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.410
So, does this have anything
to do with the case?

20:10.443 --> 20:11.544
No.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.282
Something I should know about?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.816
No.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.720
Okay, then.
(sighs)

20:20.753 --> 20:22.689
Where to now, Miss Daisy?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.429
I-I've left you
at least a dozen messages.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.763
16, but who's counting.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.032
Look, as soon as your hair
shows up, you will be

20:33.065 --> 20:34.901
the first call that someone
other than me will make.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.969
You know, I really feel
like there's this, uh,

20:37.003 --> 20:38.905
chemistry here
that you might be denying.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.740
The only one
denying chemistry is you.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.311
I suggest you go to your shrink
and have him write you a script.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.545
I did that already.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.980
This is me, healthy.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.950
This is me,
getting back to my job.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.888
DAVID:
Man has got money.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.424
NIKKI:
Not that much.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.992
Hey, where's your girlfriend?

21:00.026 --> 21:01.994
Not Colby. The other one.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.430
The girl.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.597
(laughs)

21:04.631 --> 21:06.699
Okay. What do you got?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.535
The list the, uh...

21:08.568 --> 21:10.937
Paula Watson, the seat filler
coordinator, gave us.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.672
Six of the names were bogus.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.841
DAVID:
That's the same number of guys

21:14.874 --> 21:16.042
Charlie thinks
we're looking for.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.009
There's more.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.745
Now, I spoke with one
of the seat fillers

21:18.778 --> 21:19.912
that was there that night.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.314
He asked Paula if he could sit

21:21.348 --> 21:22.915
in an open seat
next to Sven Regal.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.484
You know, kid's seen
all of his movies.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.619
And he still wanted
to sit next to him?

21:26.653 --> 21:28.988
Well, Paula told him
she had the seat reserved.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.824
She gave it to an older guy
who spoke Spanish.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.092
And before the show,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.428
the kid saw him hanging
with five other guys,

21:35.462 --> 21:37.096
all older, all Spanish-speaking.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.666
And they did not look
like they were there for fun.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.968
PAULA:
I hired a lot of people

21:42.001 --> 21:43.736
- that night.
- A half dozen of whom

21:43.770 --> 21:45.838
are willing to testify
that you saved seats

21:45.872 --> 21:47.540
for a crew
of Spanish-speaking guys.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.008
Now, if we connect them
to the robbery,

21:49.041 --> 21:51.378
you look a lot like
an accomplice.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.880
Especially if you keep
lying to me.

21:56.783 --> 22:00.119
One of the camera operators,
Geno Murelli,

22:00.152 --> 22:01.954
he told me he had a cousin

22:01.988 --> 22:03.623
who was a-a really big fan
of Sven Regal.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.125
Asked me if I could
put him in a seat next to him.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.527
I had the schedule, I knew where

22:07.560 --> 22:09.095
all the open seats
were going to be.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.129
What about the others?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.931
Geno gave me a list.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.567
Other friends...
who wanted to sit

22:14.601 --> 22:16.068
- next to other actors.
- And you bought his story?

22:16.102 --> 22:19.839
At $600 a favor, I-I really
didn't think about it.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.443
If I had enough imagination
to guess

22:23.476 --> 22:25.044
what Geno was up to, I...

22:25.077 --> 22:26.946
I wouldn't be doing this
for a living.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.716
Yeah, well,
where can we find him?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.926
COLBY:
Clear.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.528
DAVID: Clear.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.032
Got a body.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.066
Still warm.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.135
Well, lukewarm anyway.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.703
Geno did his homework.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.773
NIKKI:
Gun!

22:54.907 --> 22:55.875
He's headed for the roof.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.009
Take the stairs.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.127
(bullets ricocheting)

23:39.151 --> 23:41.954
Well, there's one way
to obstruct an investigation.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.564
DAVID: The body in the apartment
was Geno Murelli,

23:51.598 --> 23:53.165
camera operator for the show.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.167
He worked the aisles,
getting close-ups of the stars

23:55.201 --> 23:57.737
looking happy while they lose.
Now, he had a seating chart,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.706
floor plan,
schedule of the show.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.773
- He had everything.
- ELIZABETH: Except the loot.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.174
Yeah, we didn't find any

24:02.208 --> 24:03.710
of the missing jewelry
at his apartment.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.646
We I.D.'d the guy who took
a header off the roof.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.080
Jose Duran.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.149
He's a Colombian in the country
on a tourist visa.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.251
SID had a hard time
getting his prints.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.720
- Why is that?
- Scarring.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.154
His fingertips were all torn up.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.222
Which would suggest
we're dealing

24:16.255 --> 24:18.591
with a South American
Theft Group.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.627
SATGs operate out
of different countries,

24:20.660 --> 24:22.161
specializing in jewelry theft.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.797
How do you get all that
from scarred fingers?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.733
To join, you have to pass
a test called the seven bells.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.100
They place a coat
on a mannequin,

24:28.134 --> 24:29.636
put a piece of jewelry
in the pocket.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.037
The recruit has
to retrieve the jewelry

24:31.070 --> 24:32.605
without ringing the bell.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.074
Oh, they also put
razor blades in the pockets.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.143
Just to keep it interesting.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.211
SATG members
don't trust outsiders,

24:39.245 --> 24:41.080
so they may have used
Geno Murelli

24:41.113 --> 24:43.249
for access and information,
but he was not a shot caller.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.618
Murelli signed
an immigration visa

24:45.652 --> 24:48.254
for a cousin
named Raul Hernandez.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.723
He's on our watch list,

24:50.757 --> 24:53.125
suspected of running a ring
in BogotГЎ.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.262
I would venture to guess
that he's our shot-caller.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.665
Well, Charlie and Amita
need faces,

24:58.698 --> 25:00.199
so why don't you give them
Hernandez and this guy.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.706
How is the facial recognition
going?

25:06.739 --> 25:09.008
Video's degraded.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.010
We're having trouble.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.013
No, there is Raul Hernandez.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.748
CHARLIE:
The SATG leader.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.049
AMITA:
I've got a metric on his route

25:17.083 --> 25:19.151
and rate of exit
from the theater.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.887
So, let's turn the crowd flux
program loose

25:20.920 --> 25:23.155
and then see if we can find
the rest of them.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.124
LARRY: You know,
this is like the M-170 story.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.859
What is?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.728
We just got our first match.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.029
LARRY:
It's just all harkening back

25:30.062 --> 25:33.165
to my time in the desert,
my work.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.034
Just got two more.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.035
CHARLIE:
M-170--

25:36.068 --> 25:37.570
that's a star.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.071
Yeah, it's tucked away
in Andromeda.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.841
And much as I never
wanted to play favorites

25:41.874 --> 25:43.075
among constellations,

25:43.109 --> 25:44.310
I did always admire its...

25:44.343 --> 25:46.779
AMITA:
There's Jose Duran.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.180
...simple yet elegant V-shape.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.016
AMITA:
We got them.

25:50.049 --> 25:50.983
We got the whole crew.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.021
It can wait.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.192
Did you, uh... you pull
their rap sheets yet?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.694
I did, yeah.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.029
I, uh, printed them out.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.998
That's the file I left
on Don's desk, I think.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.203
You know anything
about an old case--

26:11.237 --> 26:13.339
uh, perp's name
was Marcus Taylor?

26:13.372 --> 26:15.141
Yeah, he died in prison
a few days ago.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.143
I think he's, uh,
one of Don's old collars.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.878
Why?

26:20.146 --> 26:21.714
No reason.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.616
- Here you go.
- Hey, thanks.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.862
Can't say I recognize
any of them.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.964
You really think they came
in here to case my store?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.265
These guys are smart, Hans.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.867
DAVID:
If I risked a heist this big,

26:40.900 --> 26:43.169
I would definitely case
the merchandise.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.304
Uh, you have digital files
on these cameras, right?

26:45.337 --> 26:48.307
I'll ask my nephew to put
the files on disk for you.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.042
DAVID: I thought you fired
your nephew.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.278
I did.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.147
My sister-in-law
can be quite vocal.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.785
And my brother owns a piece
in the business.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.321
Hmm.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.124
Engraved platinum.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.325
Retail...

27:06.358 --> 27:10.062
it's probably worth
about 150 grand.

27:10.096 --> 27:10.997
(gasps)

27:11.030 --> 27:14.066
Look at the color,
the sheer brilliance.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.302
The pattern of inclusions
makes it unique.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.104
Like a fingerprint.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.139
Easy enough to be drawn
to the shine,

27:20.172 --> 27:22.975
or the smooth, hard texture.

27:24.110 --> 27:27.780
I think we understand that...

27:27.814 --> 27:30.182
on an animal level.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.318
HANS:
An excellent choice.

27:35.021 --> 27:38.157
Yeah, I'll be back
in about 80 years

27:38.190 --> 27:40.026
to pay for it.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.898
I'll need those disks
as soon as you can get them.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.738
(door opens)
CHARLIE: Hey.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.172
(door closes)
ALAN: Hi.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.307
Oh, what are we doing here?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.208
I'm conducting a postmortem

27:56.242 --> 27:59.078
on my afternoon chess game
with Larry.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.913
I mean, whatever that guy
was doing in the desert,

28:00.947 --> 28:03.182
he's come back
as Garry Kasparov.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.884
We used to be evenly matched.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.152
He's killing me now.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.054
And Don...

28:08.087 --> 28:10.222
he took me apart
with one eye on the TV.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.924
Am I slipping, Charlie?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.993
You know,
that's hard to say, Dad.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.928
I never really got your game.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.196
Just the reassurance
I was looking for.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.331
And what about Larry?

28:19.365 --> 28:22.101
Did you talk to him about this
Howard Hughes look of his?

28:22.134 --> 28:25.504
Yeah, he started to,
but then it sort of dropped.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.406
You let it drop?

28:27.439 --> 28:31.077
He's... different this time.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.511
I look in his eyes,

28:32.544 --> 28:34.380
and there's a clarity there.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.082
You know, I used to worry
about him,

28:36.115 --> 28:37.349
I used to worry about me,

28:37.383 --> 28:39.051
but, uh,

28:39.085 --> 28:41.220
I think we're okay
with it all now.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.296
- Nice.
- You want them?

28:50.329 --> 28:51.798
Eh, no, not now.

28:53.265 --> 28:54.500
Sven Regal.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.235
(laughing)

28:56.268 --> 28:59.939
Well, I don't know,
I guess, uh, you could do worse.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.774
No, actually,

29:01.808 --> 29:03.342
you have done worse.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.945
And I think you get the ponytail
in the settlement.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.413
We have to recover it first.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.349
There's still no sign
of the missing jewelry.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.819
Word on the street is
nobody's tried to fence it yet.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.386
What about the SATG crew?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.989
We ran background on the guys
Charlie and Amita I.D.'d.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.158
Three of them had parole visits

29:19.191 --> 29:20.426
at the same location
last month--

29:20.459 --> 29:22.228
a sweatshop
in the garment district.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.329
Listed as their place
of employment.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.231
Let's check it out.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.000
Hey, uh, maybe we should
bring Lloyd's along,

29:28.034 --> 29:31.070
you know, in case we find
something sparkly.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.338
That's a good idea.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.310
Nikki, with me.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.312
Colby, take a squad
and go around back.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.048
Uh, stay in the car.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.349
Of course.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.951
We'll radio
when it's all clear.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.057
(machines whirring)

30:00.466 --> 30:02.134
(machines stop)
Get them out of here.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.302
Come.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.079
COLBY:
Put that gun down.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.348
Put it down.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.020
(handcuffs clicking)

31:00.026 --> 31:01.660
DAVID:
This isn't all of it.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.662
We got four soldiers,
but no Raul.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.198
Raul Hernandez-- where is he?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.000
ВїDГіnde estГЎ el jefe?

31:11.303 --> 31:13.005
So much for waiting in the car.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.240
I found her trying to escape

31:14.273 --> 31:16.142
with the rest
of the sweatshop girls.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.377
Only, she needs a shave.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.946
Don't you think?

31:31.457 --> 31:33.492
NIKKI:
Raul Hernandez.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.395
Robbery,
possession of stolen property,

31:36.428 --> 31:39.065
smuggling, evading arrest,

31:39.098 --> 31:41.467
impersonating a woman... poorly.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.002
And how long
before we connect you

31:43.035 --> 31:45.004
to Duran killing Geno?

31:45.037 --> 31:47.206
Motive's easy enough--

31:47.239 --> 31:49.108
you got greedy, cut him out.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.378
Geno didn't die for my greed.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.645
He died for

31:53.679 --> 31:57.349
his own greed and stupidity.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.650
Care to be more specific?

32:04.356 --> 32:05.724
I was, um...

32:05.757 --> 32:08.194
I was thinking maybe
we could, uh...

32:08.227 --> 32:11.463
maybe we could get some, uh...
some dinner sometime.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.499
You know?
(sighs)

32:17.536 --> 32:20.006
Or not.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.513
Remember what I said
about inclusions?

32:27.546 --> 32:28.680
Yeah.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.182
Diamonds have fingerprints.
There's always a pattern.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.251
And if there isn't?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.124
Guess why Hernandez
had Geno offed.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.460
Because most of what
they stole was paste.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.199
You could've let me say it.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.470
Good news?

32:51.503 --> 32:53.339
DAVID: It depends
on how you look at it.

32:53.372 --> 32:54.506
Uh, we made some arrests.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.008
And recovered most
of the jewelry.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.209
Most of it?

32:57.243 --> 32:58.444
DAVID:
Don't worry, we recovered

32:58.477 --> 32:59.411
all of yours.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.247
Oh.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.215
Every single item is fake.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.650
Maybe they...

33:04.683 --> 33:07.286
Duplicated 29 pieces of famous
jewelry for the fun of it?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.754
You filed an insurance claim
for millions

33:08.787 --> 33:11.390
on glass that was worth
less than a couple of grand.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.192
DAVID:
Your nephew, he is looking

33:13.225 --> 33:15.361
like the smart one
in the family now.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.097
Look, I've had a number of bad
experiences loaning out jewelry.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.331
Items get damaged,

33:19.365 --> 33:22.568
actors always seem
to forget to return them,

33:22.601 --> 33:23.769
and I end up in court.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.337
So, you forgot to tell us

33:25.371 --> 33:27.673
and Lloyd's that you didn't lose
any real pieces?

33:27.706 --> 33:28.674
If it gets out

33:28.707 --> 33:31.510
that I was sending actors out
wearing glass,

33:31.543 --> 33:35.181
there isn't a stylist in town
that will come in here again.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.448
I was in a very
difficult position.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.217
DAVID:
Or you set up the robberies,

33:38.250 --> 33:40.486
but didn't want to lose
any of your property.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.321
If you think for one second

33:42.354 --> 33:45.324
that I'm some kind
of mastermind,

33:45.357 --> 33:48.194
well, that-that's absurd!

33:48.227 --> 33:50.262
Well, how about we debate the
absurdity of it all downtown?

33:51.730 --> 33:53.332
Come on.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.277
There has to be a connection
between Hans and Geno Murelli.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.445
I'm not so certain.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.581
I've known Hans a long time,
and...

34:09.615 --> 34:11.483
and he lacks the audacity
for something like this.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.152
You think Hans
is an opportunist?

34:13.185 --> 34:14.786
What, a bunch of his fakes

34:14.820 --> 34:17.489
get stolen,
so he covers his ass and sees

34:17.523 --> 34:19.091
a chance to make
some insurance money.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.193
- Mmm.
- Meanwhile, Raul opens

34:21.227 --> 34:22.528
his haul, it's mostly glass,

34:22.561 --> 34:24.396
he thinks that Geno
double-crossed him.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.631
Unfortunate for Geno,

34:25.664 --> 34:28.734
but... pretty much
closes my case.

34:28.767 --> 34:32.070
Hey, I need to show
you something.

34:35.707 --> 34:38.644
Mapping the movements
of the six thieves,

34:38.677 --> 34:40.812
I found an anomaly
in the behavior

34:40.846 --> 34:43.549
of thief number four,
Jose Duran.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.552
See, all of the other thieves
were efficient.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.655
They robbed their victims,
left quickly, but, uh,

34:49.688 --> 34:51.423
Duran took an irregular route.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.627
DON:
He makes the hit,

34:55.661 --> 34:57.296
and then does this dogleg
thing?

34:57.329 --> 34:58.197
DAVID: Yeah, he went

34:58.230 --> 34:59.198
down the aisle, uh,
toward the stage,

34:59.231 --> 35:00.399
- looped around, then exited.
- CHARLIE: Yeah,

35:00.432 --> 35:03.369
and according to the inventory,
the jewelry still missing

35:03.402 --> 35:04.770
all belonged to his victims.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.305
- You got a theory?
- I don't.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.207
The floor plans only show us
one perspective.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.575
DAVID: It sounds like we need
to take another walk

35:09.608 --> 35:10.809
around that theater.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.480
Okay, so, Colby,
you're thief number four.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.647
(Larry clears throat)

35:15.681 --> 35:17.149
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.550
I-I promised Larry
he could be the thief.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.219
LARRY:
It just seems more consistent

35:20.252 --> 35:21.753
with my unrestrained id.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.255
Okay, well, fine. I'll, uh...

35:23.289 --> 35:24.089
I'll just be an actor.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.491
- DAVID: Oh, really?
- COLBY: Yeah.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.326
I got the shoulders for it.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.860
All right, so that makes Colby
victim number one,

35:28.894 --> 35:31.497
uh, followed quickly by Amita
and then David.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.400
Jewelry in hand, the thief exits

35:34.433 --> 35:36.668
into the aisle toward
the front of the theater,

35:36.702 --> 35:39.405
then loops around the front row,

35:39.438 --> 35:42.541
exiting toward the rear
with the rest of the crowd.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.744
You know, I'm sorry--
this just seems

35:45.777 --> 35:47.946
- terribly inefficient.
- COLBY: And stupid. I mean,

35:47.979 --> 35:50.182
the smoke's starting to clear,
the crowd's thinning out.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.818
Why does he risk
making another loop this way

35:52.851 --> 35:54.353
when he's already this far
from the exit?

35:54.386 --> 35:56.855
Farthest from the exit.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.524
Highest risk of getting caught.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.858
DAVID:
Hey, what if he, uh...

35:59.891 --> 36:01.193
what if he made a hand-off?

36:01.227 --> 36:03.695
CHARLIE:
Well, let's see.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.696
Uh, according to the schedule,

36:04.730 --> 36:07.733
the director had camera
operators in the aisle,

36:07.766 --> 36:09.701
getting close-ups,
at the time of the robbery.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.703
Geno Murelli.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.239
The inside man.

36:13.272 --> 36:16.808
Ten after 6:00, Geno Murelli
was... right there.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.810
Right where thief number four
came down the aisle.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.280
If Duran made
a hand-off to Geno,

36:21.313 --> 36:22.714
then how come we didn't find

36:22.748 --> 36:23.982
any loot at his place?

36:24.015 --> 36:26.452
- Maybe he'd fenced it already.
- Or maybe Geno

36:26.485 --> 36:27.586
handed it off to someone else.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.724
You guys...

36:32.758 --> 36:34.260
I think I found
the missing jewelry.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.751
(gasps)

37:06.658 --> 37:10.396
Apparently, we do meet again...
in this world.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.343
Geno and I were old friends.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.412
I mean,

37:26.445 --> 37:29.848
going back all the way
to my days on The Conjurer.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.287
Oh, he used to...

37:35.321 --> 37:37.289
write out my lines
on Post-it notes

37:37.323 --> 37:39.691
and put them all over the set

37:39.725 --> 37:41.693
so that I didn't even have
to bother learning them.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.731
Well, in spite
of what the producers,

37:45.764 --> 37:47.766
the director
and other actors said,

37:47.799 --> 37:49.668
it was a perfectly
legitimate method.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.036
Flashing forward 20 years.

37:53.038 --> 37:56.542
I was having cash flow problems.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.810
"Actress of a certain age"
syndrome.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.812
The roles go away,

38:00.846 --> 38:03.515
but the lifestyle doesn't.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.518
I needed the money.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.753
DAVID:
And Geno needed someone

38:07.786 --> 38:09.321
to help him hide the jewelry.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.823
During the chaos, he...

38:11.857 --> 38:13.825
he handed me the stolen jewelry.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.527
(clears throat)

38:15.561 --> 38:17.529
He had rigged a compartment

38:17.563 --> 38:19.097
inside the seat.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.400
And then you added your necklace
to the stash,

38:21.433 --> 38:23.435
and you filed for insurance.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.973
I don't think I want to know
what happens next.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.808
It's not a happy ending.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.914
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.550
- Yeah, have a good one.
- All right, you, too.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.124
- Hey, isn't that, um...
- Ah, it's a pity date.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.093
And besides, that is the car

38:48.126 --> 38:50.095
from Boneyard 5000.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.097
He's going to let me drive it.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.499
(sighs)

38:53.532 --> 38:55.133
Is that all it takes?

38:55.166 --> 38:57.002
Man, tell me you don't want to.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.410
Maybe just a little bit.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.811
(engine starting)

39:05.844 --> 39:06.978
(car doors closing)

39:16.054 --> 39:18.924
We got signed confessions
from Raul Hernandez

39:18.957 --> 39:20.759
and Regina Landers.

39:20.792 --> 39:21.760
Hans is still hiding
behind his lawyer.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.795
Yeah, go figure.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.166
I didn't know you
were a watch guy.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.401
Oh, I'm not.

39:29.435 --> 39:30.802
Really, I just...

39:32.170 --> 39:34.506
So, that's what was in
the evidence bag, huh?

39:35.807 --> 39:38.610
I looked up Marcus Taylor.

39:38.644 --> 39:42.481
He died of lung cancer
in San Quentin three days ago.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.418
And 11 years ago,
he was a fugitive,

39:46.452 --> 39:47.953
arrested by Don Eppes.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.956
We tracked him to a motel.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.725
You know, he panicked,
and he grabs the manager

39:53.759 --> 39:55.060
and puts a gun
to his head and...

39:56.194 --> 39:57.763
And, of course,

39:57.796 --> 39:59.931
he never stopped appealing,
so...

39:59.965 --> 40:01.967
So that watch sat in evidence
for 11 years?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.969
Yeah.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.571
The manager had
a seven-year-old boy.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.075
Think how many times have
we walked away from a scene

40:10.108 --> 40:11.877
and just wiped the blood
off our shoes.

40:15.481 --> 40:18.517
The boy deserves
to have his father's watch.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.563
CHARLIE:
So...

40:31.597 --> 40:32.964
M-170.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.934
The amateur astronomer,
Robert Evans, holds the record

40:35.967 --> 40:38.537
for visual discovery
of supernovae.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.138
Savant-like, he commits

40:40.171 --> 40:42.140
whole star fields to memory,

40:42.173 --> 40:44.876
intuiting even subtle changes
in the night sky.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.647
M-170 has always
been there for me.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.982
Was like my wishing star,
if you will.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.118
Then, one night I looked,

40:53.151 --> 40:54.586
and it was gone.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.756
You witnessed
the death of a star?

40:57.789 --> 40:58.857
It had already been dead

40:58.890 --> 41:00.892
for 2.2 million light-years.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.061
That's what got me to thinking.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.064
How many of these stars
were already dead?

41:06.097 --> 41:08.867
You know, am I staring
into some celestial cemetery?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.168
The big bang.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.837
Astrophysics.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.805
I mean, I've spent my entire
life staring into the past.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.608
So...

41:16.642 --> 41:20.245
I turned my inner eye
180 degrees

41:20.278 --> 41:22.247
to look to the future.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.882
Charles,

41:23.915 --> 41:26.885
I have developed
a coherent theory

41:26.918 --> 41:29.054
for the future of the cosmos.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.527
Is the universe expanding?

41:35.561 --> 41:36.528
Is it contracting?

41:36.562 --> 41:38.196
Is it on a flatline?

41:38.229 --> 41:40.065
Until I solve one
or two more things,

41:40.098 --> 41:42.000
I think it best
to keep this to myself.

41:42.033 --> 41:42.968
That's why I'm back.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.037
To avail myself
of Cal Sci's supercomputers

41:46.071 --> 41:47.906
and investigate my theory.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.941
And how long
till the big announcement?

41:49.975 --> 41:53.178
Well, the PoincarГ© conjecture
took how long to solve?

41:53.211 --> 41:55.113
102 years.

41:56.748 --> 41:57.983
I think I can do a little better
than that.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.263
DAVID:
Room service.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.899
(chuckling)

42:13.932 --> 42:17.969
* I'm so tired of playing

42:19.605 --> 42:20.972
Thought we, uh, had a date.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.307
You didn't get my text.

42:23.642 --> 42:24.876
No.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.878
My office called.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.814
I have another assignment.

42:28.847 --> 42:30.816
Paris.

42:30.849 --> 42:32.784
My, uh, flight leaves
in an hour.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.185
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.587
It's a job.

42:35.621 --> 42:36.755
It's work.

42:36.788 --> 42:39.658
I would ask you to come with me,

42:39.691 --> 42:41.192
but...

42:41.226 --> 42:42.828
Yeah, that's a nice thought.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.098
(sighs)
Come here.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.134
* Give me a reason

42:49.167 --> 42:50.602
You have a good flight.

42:50.636 --> 42:53.271
Listen.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.707
I still have an hour.

43:01.246 --> 43:04.983
-* I just want to be a woman.
-(clears throat)
