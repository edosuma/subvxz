WEBVTT

00:11.410 --> 00:12.619
Hey!

00:14.530 --> 00:16.894
The Feast of the Flower!

00:16.897 --> 00:19.578
A festival of food, dancing, and music

00:19.579 --> 00:21.369
that celebrates the once-a-year bloom

00:21.370 --> 00:24.238
of the the legendary Drosera Occidendum,

00:24.239 --> 00:25.723
a one-of-a-kind flower!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.449
- Never heard of it.
- Me neither!

00:27.450 --> 00:30.159
A cultural tradition
I know nothing about.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.450
You know how rare that is?

00:33.580 --> 00:35.199
What are you doing?

00:35.200 --> 00:36.783
Documenting my adventures.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.895
The people will want to feel like

00:37.897 --> 00:39.318
they were here with me.

00:39.319 --> 00:43.318
This place is going to
look guh-reat on my profile.

00:43.319 --> 00:45.488
It already looks great!

00:45.489 --> 00:47.619
But now it's in sepia!

00:47.620 --> 00:51.199
Eh? Eeeehh?

00:51.200 --> 00:54.199
Oh, boy! I can't wait to see my pals!

00:54.202 --> 00:56.037
Sorry, who are these friends of yours?

00:56.040 --> 00:57.369
And why haven't we ever heard of them?

00:57.370 --> 00:59.449
And why did you all stop speaking?

00:59.450 --> 01:00.685
- And...
- Please,

01:00.686 --> 01:03.277
not everything is a dark family secret.

01:03.279 --> 01:06.320
Kids, I've got a dark family secret.

01:09.098 --> 01:10.369
I...

01:10.370 --> 01:12.238
Yeah?

01:12.239 --> 01:15.320
...was one of the Three Caballeros.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.238
- Oh! Good for you!
- Yeah, Three Caba-Waba...

01:19.239 --> 01:20.750
I don't know what that is.

01:20.753 --> 01:23.032
The Three Caballeros.

01:23.035 --> 01:25.238
Donald's old college band.

01:25.239 --> 01:27.319
They practiced their
polyphonic pandemonium

01:27.320 --> 01:29.449
in my garage for hours on end.

01:29.450 --> 01:31.319
Ah, the next time you
complain about bagpipes,

01:31.320 --> 01:33.528
just imagine trying to sleep
while your uncle saws away

01:33.529 --> 01:35.159
at an accordion.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.369
Huh?

01:36.370 --> 01:38.489
I was so awesome.

01:40.239 --> 01:42.348
Awk, you're find as is.

01:42.351 --> 01:45.238
A family man. A boat owner.
You're more impressive

01:45.241 --> 01:47.402
than those two warbling wastrels are.

01:47.405 --> 01:48.576
Huh?

01:52.160 --> 01:53.759
A-ha!

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.703 --> 02:03.742
Ha ha!

02:14.258 --> 02:16.577
Oh, they are much more
impressive than you.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.238
- Ah! Ha ha!
- Donald!

02:54.029 --> 02:55.029
A-ha!

02:58.264 --> 03:01.553
Squawk, crow, quack, I got your back!

03:01.556 --> 03:04.072
Secret handshake! Cool!

03:04.450 --> 03:06.279
- Mm.
- Ha ha!

03:06.280 --> 03:08.714
Saludos, amigos!

03:08.717 --> 03:12.296
Surely you remember
old Panchito and José!

03:12.299 --> 03:13.637
Os patinhos!

03:13.640 --> 03:16.988
Oh, last time we saw you,
you were just little eggs!

03:16.989 --> 03:20.803
Hey, remember when you insisted
you could juggle the eggs?

03:21.989 --> 03:23.652
And you dropped one!

03:27.239 --> 03:30.280
Now, just who is paying
for this little vacation?

03:30.283 --> 03:34.312
Ha! Scrooge. The same old miser, eh?

03:34.315 --> 03:37.455
I've taken care of everyone's stay!

03:37.458 --> 03:40.747
As a travel consultant
and global tastemaker,

03:40.750 --> 03:44.328
I'm always being asked
to sample the best places,

03:44.329 --> 03:47.172
the best food, the best everything!

03:47.175 --> 03:48.749
With all my jet setting,

03:48.750 --> 03:51.578
it will be nice to spend
a night on solid ground.

03:54.289 --> 03:57.459
It's my agent. Hm. Again.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.459
When you are an
international pop sensation,

04:00.460 --> 04:03.459
you are but a slave to fame.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.418
"Panchito, sign my baby."

04:05.419 --> 04:07.499
"Panchito, present at this awards show,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.619
and also win most of the awards."

04:09.620 --> 04:11.797
It is non-stop, my friends!

04:11.800 --> 04:16.733
But this weekend, the
Three Caballeros ride again!

04:16.736 --> 04:19.418
Just like old times, eh, amigos?

04:19.420 --> 04:21.843
Tell us everything
embarrassing about Uncle Donald!

04:21.846 --> 04:25.419
Embarrassing? Your
uncle was the cool one!

04:25.420 --> 04:28.499
Always off on globetrotting adventures.

04:34.849 --> 04:37.289
What are you now? A superspy?

04:37.290 --> 04:38.578
A... a world-famous DJ?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.717
Some insane combination of the two?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.459
Surely, you are super
successful and impressive.

04:49.001 --> 04:50.539
Breathe. Just breathe.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.419
I've done nothing with my life!

04:52.420 --> 04:53.756
I'm a failure!

04:53.759 --> 04:56.669
Aw, that never bothered you before.

04:56.670 --> 04:59.707
Uncle Donald, you're very successful!

04:59.710 --> 05:02.533
You raised three boys
and are rich in love!

05:02.536 --> 05:04.328
Isn't that the true measure of success?

05:04.329 --> 05:05.378
No!

05:05.379 --> 05:08.208
Huey, you gotta help me!

05:08.209 --> 05:10.289
Help you? Well, I have been looking

05:10.290 --> 05:12.578
to earn my Improv Theatre merit badge.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.539
How about you play the
part of someone successful?

05:15.540 --> 05:17.419
Lie? Perfect!

05:17.420 --> 05:19.378
Nonsense! You do what you want,

05:19.379 --> 05:20.619
but I will not help you lie

05:20.620 --> 05:24.169
to impress that band of braggadocios.

05:24.170 --> 05:26.208
If you blow our cover,
José will probably get mad

05:26.209 --> 05:28.419
and you'll have to pay
for this trip yourself.

05:28.420 --> 05:31.026
Donald, we have to lie to
your friends, do y'hear?

05:32.420 --> 05:34.539
Just keep it small and simple.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.169
Sorry, everyone! Uncle Donald had, uh,

05:39.170 --> 05:40.859
a very important business call!

05:40.862 --> 05:43.289
From McDuck Enterprises!

05:43.290 --> 05:46.419
My company! I'm a billionaire!

05:46.420 --> 05:50.683
The same Donald who searched
our couch cushions for corn chips

05:50.686 --> 05:53.328
now owns McDuck Enterprises?

05:53.329 --> 05:56.541
Yes! And he's taking
over the family business

05:56.544 --> 05:58.630
so Scrooge can retire.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.249
'Cause he's so old!

06:01.250 --> 06:02.869
Very, very old!

06:02.872 --> 06:04.419
Because I'm so...!

06:07.120 --> 06:10.119
So old!

06:10.120 --> 06:12.328
So very, very old.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.805
Oh, Donald, is that you?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.119
Oh!

06:16.122 --> 06:19.602
My eyes are as clouded as my mind!

06:19.605 --> 06:20.934
Ow!

06:20.937 --> 06:23.169
Taking care of his uncle's legacy.

06:23.170 --> 06:26.208
A man of great wealth and kindness.

06:26.209 --> 06:27.209
Oof!

06:34.120 --> 06:36.425
"Long ago, an invading force

06:36.428 --> 06:39.289
led a bloody massacre
that left the town empty.

06:39.290 --> 06:42.289
From the wreckage, a single flower grew,

06:42.290 --> 06:45.289
proving that no matter
how terrible a tragedy,

06:45.290 --> 06:48.442
life will always find
a way to bloom anew.

06:48.445 --> 06:52.458
Now, the town celebrates
this triumph every year."

06:52.459 --> 06:55.529
Or something like that. My
Portuguese is a little enferrujado.

06:55.532 --> 06:58.346
Webby, get out of the way! You're
ruining my shot with your story!

06:58.349 --> 07:01.718
My story provides
context for your photo!

07:01.721 --> 07:05.419
Of course! This is a moment
of cultural significance.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.499
Louie, get a full body shot. Hit it!

07:07.500 --> 07:10.249
OK, look thoughtful. No, not confused.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.169
OK, don't move. That's the stuff!

07:18.379 --> 07:20.078
I know it's not on the menu,

07:20.079 --> 07:22.208
but can I get some deep-fried cassava?

07:22.209 --> 07:25.389
Oh, you have to try it. It
melts right in your mouth.

07:25.392 --> 07:27.839
Please. The adventurous billionaire

07:27.842 --> 07:30.328
must have a refined palette.

07:30.329 --> 07:33.458
I'll have the kids macaroni and cheese!

07:33.459 --> 07:36.609
Eh, thanks for ordering
for me, Uncle Donald.

07:36.612 --> 07:40.249
He will have the Moqueca Baiana.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.209
And more steak sticks!

07:47.290 --> 07:49.169
Aye, I'm so sorry!

07:49.170 --> 07:53.280
Here, let Panchito
wipe your troubles away,

07:53.283 --> 07:56.078
which, coincidentally, is
the title of my new album.

07:56.079 --> 07:59.603
A keepsake. To remember me by.

07:59.606 --> 08:01.119
Thank you.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.119
Classic Brazilian hospitality.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.106
OK, now show me how
much you want that bite!

08:06.109 --> 08:08.169
Mmm, you're so hungry!

08:08.170 --> 08:11.611
Ooh, you're like a hungry bear
about to go into hibernation!

08:11.614 --> 08:13.999
You need all the sustenance you can get!

08:15.079 --> 08:16.169
Perfect, yeah, no,

08:16.170 --> 08:18.119
I think I really captured the flavor.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.119
They make this pastel once a year

08:20.120 --> 08:21.467
in honor of the bloom,

08:21.470 --> 08:24.419
and you're not even going to eat it?!

08:24.420 --> 08:26.433
It's cold now.

08:26.436 --> 08:29.949
Fine! More cultural experience for me!

08:50.169 --> 08:53.643
OK, we cannot all
whistle inconspicuously.

08:53.646 --> 08:55.999
Let's settle this like adults.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.418
Donald should pay, because
he's the billionaire!

08:58.419 --> 09:02.080
Uh-huh. Right.

09:09.169 --> 09:11.039
Excuse me.

09:17.289 --> 09:20.825
And a nice big tip, too!

09:20.828 --> 09:22.903
Come, come, Uncle Scrooge.

09:22.906 --> 09:26.249
Let's get you some rest.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.959
Have a great day.

09:29.379 --> 09:31.038
Sorry, what was that?

09:31.039 --> 09:32.363
Have a great day.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.039
Man, everyone here is so nice!

09:42.706 --> 09:44.365
Huh?

09:44.368 --> 09:45.658
Who's excited for a tour

09:45.661 --> 09:47.369
of fascinating historical sights

09:47.372 --> 09:49.348
on the back of this noble burro?

09:49.351 --> 09:51.230
Webby is!

09:54.420 --> 09:56.468
The Brazilian dust in your eyes,

09:56.469 --> 09:58.419
the authentic smell of donkey,

09:58.420 --> 10:01.037
the saddle sores that
remind you of your experience

10:01.040 --> 10:02.468
for weeks to come!

10:02.469 --> 10:04.299
You can't get that in a photo!

10:04.300 --> 10:06.379
Yeah. That's why photos are better.

10:07.679 --> 10:09.419
Oof. One more!

10:10.420 --> 10:11.678
Eeh, one more!

10:15.300 --> 10:16.510
Have a great day.

10:20.251 --> 10:21.927
OK, we'll just crop her out later.

10:21.930 --> 10:23.338
You know, just forget it.

10:23.339 --> 10:26.588
Onto the adventure of learning!

10:26.589 --> 10:28.732
Where'd they go? We missed the tour!

10:28.735 --> 10:30.259
But we got a picture.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.259
How is a picture better than a tour

10:32.260 --> 10:34.509
with Sir Reginald von Hoofy the Third?

10:34.510 --> 10:37.629
Webbigail, a wise old man
once gave me this advice:

10:37.630 --> 10:40.218
"Pics, or it didn't happen."

10:40.219 --> 10:41.791
It didn't happen!

10:41.794 --> 10:44.588
But, according to this pic, it did.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.539
So wise.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.338
Remember that show we played

10:49.339 --> 10:51.178
down in Acapulco over Spring Break?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.478
The crowd!

10:53.481 --> 10:55.891
Oh, right! The crowd hated you!

10:55.894 --> 10:59.899
You hit your solo, and
they hit you with a chair!

10:59.902 --> 11:02.180
He got a concussion!

11:02.183 --> 11:03.218
I did?

11:05.550 --> 11:08.299
Yeah! And you made us finish our set

11:08.300 --> 11:10.129
as we fought our way to the exit!

11:10.130 --> 11:13.218
Yes! I broke my guitar
over someone's head!

11:13.219 --> 11:15.419
It was Donald's head! Ha!

11:15.420 --> 11:18.509
You did? Why don't I remember that?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.570
But, like a true musician,

11:20.573 --> 11:23.419
I kept playing, because...

11:23.420 --> 11:25.629
...the show must go on!

11:30.469 --> 11:33.588
Ay caramba. What a bunch of knuckleheads

11:33.589 --> 11:35.129
we used to be.

11:35.130 --> 11:36.474
But look at us now, eh?

11:36.477 --> 11:39.468
Grown up, successful, responsible.

11:39.469 --> 11:42.515
We're not those carefree,
fun-loving guys anymore.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.419
Mm?

11:56.260 --> 11:57.704
Oh!

12:05.260 --> 12:07.748
Ha! Hey!

12:28.844 --> 12:31.088
Man, I can't wait to watch
this when we get home!

12:31.089 --> 12:33.049
You could watch it now!

12:33.050 --> 12:35.178
It's happening right in front of you!

12:35.179 --> 12:37.178
OK, well, I'm gonna go take a walk

12:37.179 --> 12:39.726
to soak up the real local culture.

12:39.729 --> 12:41.613
Send us pictures of anything good!

12:45.179 --> 12:47.416
Look how happy Uncle Donald is.

12:47.419 --> 12:49.459
You can't put a price on that smile.

12:49.460 --> 12:53.934
That lunch cost me $351.47.

12:53.937 --> 12:55.640
Oh, just let him have this.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.859
It's only for one weekend.

12:57.862 --> 13:00.418
What do you mean, you're
getting the band back together?!

13:00.419 --> 13:02.018
Oh, people love a comeback!

13:02.021 --> 13:04.657
Think of the headlines:
"Panchito Reunites

13:04.660 --> 13:07.418
with Old Friends, Rockets to a Number

13:07.419 --> 13:09.236
Somehow Higher Than Number One!"

13:09.239 --> 13:10.538
I'll talk to some of my people.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.378
Perhaps we can play na Fiesta da flor!

13:12.379 --> 13:14.209
Why stop with the festival?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.538
Donald, you can pay for a tour, right?

13:16.539 --> 13:19.378
Absolutely!

13:19.379 --> 13:22.489
No broken-down station
wagons like the old days!

13:22.492 --> 13:24.209
Only the top-of-the-line!

13:24.210 --> 13:25.780
The Three Caballeros

13:25.783 --> 13:30.249
opening for Panchito Pistoles!

13:30.250 --> 13:33.485
Eh, we can work out
who opens for who later.

13:36.622 --> 13:38.685
Hey, what's the big idea?

13:38.688 --> 13:41.209
Waste my money on a tour!

13:41.210 --> 13:42.748
No-good spendthrift!

13:42.751 --> 13:45.209
And you owe me for lunch!

13:45.210 --> 13:46.459
Huh?

13:46.460 --> 13:48.378
I think you've lost
yourself in the role here.

13:48.379 --> 13:51.499
Maybe it's time to stop
acting and tell the truth.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.623
No way! I need this!

13:53.626 --> 13:56.455
I gotta go tune my instrument.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.209
And buy an instrument.

14:01.210 --> 14:02.582
Can I...? Ha!

14:07.578 --> 14:11.011
Excuse me, señora, I
am thirsty for knowledge!

14:11.014 --> 14:12.948
Can I ask you some
questions about the festival?

14:12.951 --> 14:14.119
Of course.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.288
So, how do you celebrate the bloom?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.499
Have a great day.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.619
Huh. Well, that makes sense.

14:20.620 --> 14:24.329
OK, what year was the
festival established?

14:24.330 --> 14:26.209
Thank you.

14:26.210 --> 14:28.329
No, when was the first bloom?

14:28.330 --> 14:30.249
Of course.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.288
- Huh?
- Have a great day.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.255
Thank you. Of course. Have a great day.

14:35.258 --> 14:37.168
Thank you. Of course.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.858
Have a great day. Thank you. Of course.

14:39.861 --> 14:41.288
Huh?

14:41.289 --> 14:43.288
Thank you. Of course.

14:43.289 --> 14:45.320
Have a great day. Thank you.

14:45.323 --> 14:46.714
Of course.

14:49.210 --> 14:51.369
Guys, something is wrong here!

14:52.410 --> 14:53.578
Hey! You don't just take

14:53.581 --> 14:55.491
a photographer's camera... phone.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.332
You've taken 100 photos today.

14:57.335 --> 15:00.100
Why don't you have any
pictures of people's feet?

15:00.103 --> 15:01.938
Because that would be
weird? I... I don't...?

15:01.941 --> 15:05.636
Aha! Because they don't have any feet!

15:05.639 --> 15:07.574
Huh?

15:07.654 --> 15:10.119
Huh?

15:12.419 --> 15:14.550
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

15:14.553 --> 15:16.250
Of course.

15:44.660 --> 15:45.937
Perfect!

15:45.940 --> 15:47.368
This has to stop!

15:47.369 --> 15:50.100
No way! I'm a star.

15:50.103 --> 15:52.530
You want to stand out like
your friends, I get it.

15:52.533 --> 15:53.659
But what's going to happen

15:53.660 --> 15:55.049
when you have to pay for a plane?

15:55.052 --> 15:56.738
Or a stadium. Or literally anything

15:56.739 --> 15:59.280
and you have no money!

16:00.032 --> 16:02.407
Uncle Scrooge is rich.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.578
I'll pay him back.

16:04.579 --> 16:06.488
What was that, sonny?

16:06.489 --> 16:09.052
I'm just a doddering old man

16:09.055 --> 16:12.277
who can't help you out of
this mess that you've made.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.618
Aw, phooey! I'm going out
there if you like it or not!

16:17.200 --> 16:18.319
Forget everything!

16:18.320 --> 16:19.817
We have to get out of here now!

16:19.820 --> 16:21.409
The festival is a trap!

16:21.410 --> 16:24.488
The bloom. It's a
giant carnivorous plant!

16:24.489 --> 16:28.319
You mean... we are the
Feast of the Flower?!

16:28.320 --> 16:31.488
Oh! I just put that together. Clever.

16:31.489 --> 16:33.238
But my band!

16:33.239 --> 16:35.319
Band? Man, we do our own thing

16:35.320 --> 16:36.368
for, like, 15 minutes...

16:36.369 --> 16:37.618
The fountain wasn't a legend.

16:37.619 --> 16:39.771
It was a warning! We
have to get out of here

16:39.774 --> 16:41.488
before the flower eats us all!

16:41.489 --> 16:43.756
But the show must go on?

16:43.759 --> 16:45.627
Ugh! Are you willing to risk your life

16:45.630 --> 16:47.368
to look cool for your friends?

16:47.369 --> 16:49.488
Ugh! OK!

16:49.489 --> 16:52.449
Go. I'll get the guys.

16:58.489 --> 17:00.449
We gotta get outta here!

17:00.450 --> 17:02.159
And onto the stage!

17:02.160 --> 17:03.238
Ole!

17:03.239 --> 17:05.488
The crowd is gonna eat us alive!

17:05.489 --> 17:07.488
Eh, we've played rough crowds before.

17:07.489 --> 17:08.953
Last month,

17:08.955 --> 17:10.656
a few of my more ravenous fans

17:10.660 --> 17:12.659
found me backstage and...

17:12.660 --> 17:14.488
Donald! I pulled major strings

17:14.489 --> 17:17.449
- to get us this gig!
- I never cancel a performance!

17:17.450 --> 17:19.578
The audience needs Panchito!

17:30.319 --> 17:33.200
Have a great day!

17:38.370 --> 17:40.386
"Just another day in the exciting life

17:40.389 --> 17:43.391
of Dewey Duck! #Adventure
#Derring-Dewey."

17:43.394 --> 17:44.449
Hashtag... Aah!

17:44.450 --> 17:46.102
Aw, that's a good one. I'm usin' it!

17:47.105 --> 17:48.528
No!

17:51.160 --> 17:53.278
Nooooo!

17:53.279 --> 17:55.369
I feel like the first
"No" shoulda been bigger.

17:55.370 --> 17:58.199
Hang on, kids! I'm coming... Aah!

17:58.200 --> 18:01.238
You can drop the old man act now!

18:01.239 --> 18:02.318
I can't! Oh!

18:02.319 --> 18:04.488
All that pretending threw out my back!

18:05.529 --> 18:07.238
You think you're so rich,

18:07.239 --> 18:08.810
you don't need us anymore!

18:08.813 --> 18:10.278
That's not true!

18:10.279 --> 18:11.868
Do you hear the audience out there?

18:11.871 --> 18:13.254
They're screaming for us!

18:15.370 --> 18:16.755
Don't give up on our dream!

18:16.758 --> 18:19.119
Don't you want the fame, the fans?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.523
The European tour!

18:20.526 --> 18:23.119
There isn't going to be a tour.

18:23.120 --> 18:26.238
I'm not a billionaire. I'm broke!

18:26.239 --> 18:29.440
I lied to impress you.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.199
Donald, I am so disappointed in you.

18:32.200 --> 18:37.119
To lie to such successful
and famous individuals...

18:37.120 --> 18:39.926
I... lied as well.

18:39.929 --> 18:43.278
I'm not jetsetter. I'm just
a humble flight attendant.

18:43.279 --> 18:45.491
I cashed in all my airline
points to pay for this trip.

18:45.494 --> 18:48.526
How dare you both betray me like this!

18:48.529 --> 18:49.959
I needed this tour!

18:51.666 --> 18:53.586
Because obviously, I am lying, too!

18:53.589 --> 18:55.079
I'm no superstar.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.352
I'm supposed to be performing

18:56.355 --> 18:58.320
at a child's birthday party right now.

18:58.323 --> 19:01.079
I just... I really needed something

19:01.080 --> 19:03.199
to relaunch my career.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.371
We're not so different from those
college knuckleheads after all, huh?

19:06.374 --> 19:10.080
Woulda been nice to play
again, one more time.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.481
Donald! Giant plant! Help!

19:19.410 --> 19:22.119
You know, this does explain
why the place was so cheap.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.199
And why the brochure
was printed on a leaf.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.409
I'm comin', kids!

19:27.561 --> 19:31.119
Uh-uh-uh. We have a gig to play.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.561
Are you kidding?

19:32.564 --> 19:35.386

21:10.284 --> 21:12.403
I wanna remember every single moment!

21:12.406 --> 21:14.989
Good thing I found this!

21:24.160 --> 21:26.248
No pics, so it didn't happen!

21:26.251 --> 21:27.454
So wise.

21:28.629 --> 21:30.378
I think that was even
better than Acapulco!

21:30.381 --> 21:32.577
See? When you're true to yourself,

21:32.580 --> 21:34.667
everything works out as it should!

21:34.670 --> 21:37.032
Things really did work out, huh?

21:37.035 --> 21:38.419
Maybe we should get
the band back together

21:38.420 --> 21:39.459
for real this time!

21:39.460 --> 21:42.209
That is a great idea!

21:42.210 --> 21:45.169
Oh, no! Turbulence!

21:45.170 --> 21:47.618
Curse these withered old limbs.

21:50.331 --> 21:51.916
I'm so sorry.
