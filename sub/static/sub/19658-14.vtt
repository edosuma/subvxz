11:29.681 --> 11:31.311
But I know that
you're not my dad.

11:33.841 --> 11:35.501
[Quill] Sam, wait!

11:35.531 --> 11:37.641
No worries.

11:37.671 --> 11:41.121
- I've planted a tracker on his helmet.
- [beeping]

11:41.161 --> 11:44.440
What, you think I'm gonna let
ten million units just fly away?

11:47.391 --> 11:49.231
[Samuel] Now, just have
to follow the signal...

11:49.521 --> 11:51.614
[whimpers]
right into the ground!

11:52.986 --> 11:55.016
[cries out]

11:57.571 --> 12:00.570
Coolest helmet in the galaxy.

12:03.007 --> 12:04.644
[grunts] Huh?

12:09.949 --> 12:11.254
Sorry.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.635
[guards groaning]

12:19.690 --> 12:21.450
Dad?

12:21.515 --> 12:24.256
[Mantis] I was told your
powers would be impressive.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.508
You're not my dad.

12:28.568 --> 12:32.658
I am Mantis, Celestial Protg
of the Universal Believers.

12:32.938 --> 12:35.338
- You sent me a distress signal?
- An invitation.

12:35.586 --> 12:39.054
I believe you are destined
for greatness, Samuel.

12:40.749 --> 12:42.331
Wait. How do you know my name?

12:42.511 --> 12:45.386
The Patriarch is eager
to meet you.

12:45.513 --> 12:49.449
Come with me, and our wise and
powerful leader will reveal all.

12:49.591 --> 12:52.990
Thanks, but no, thanks. I've got
more important stuff to do.

12:53.167 --> 12:57.618
The Patriarch believes he can
lead you to your father, Samuel.

13:02.926 --> 13:06.302
Huh. Something tells me
he went down.

13:08.257 --> 13:10.147
[all grunt]

13:10.780 --> 13:13.153
Sam's combat skills
are improving.

13:13.979 --> 13:16.707
[Gamora] The guards might
not be so pleased.

13:17.007 --> 13:20.913
They're Spartax military,
but I don't recognize this facility.

13:25.182 --> 13:26.891
I am Groot?

13:27.137 --> 13:30.803
Good point. Only two guards
for a joint this big?

13:30.943 --> 13:33.922
When you believe,
numbers are unimportant.

13:34.108 --> 13:37.476
Sam, you cannot trust this lady
or any of her loony kind.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.165
Funny. That's just what
she said about you guys.

13:40.385 --> 13:42.006
She can help me find my dad.

13:42.193 --> 13:44.843
She's lying.
She just wants your helmet.

13:44.910 --> 13:49.846
I need no other's power,
for I believe. Behold!

13:54.154 --> 13:57.537
Uh, that is a lot
of Belief batteries.

13:58.246 --> 13:59.803
[all gasp, grunt]

14:02.753 --> 14:04.086
[all grunt]

14:04.586 --> 14:06.649
[all straining]

14:07.916 --> 14:11.858
Prepare to be crushed
under the weight of Belief.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.950
[grunts]
That's some heavy belief.

14:15.010 --> 14:17.396
Aahh! [Groans]

14:18.911 --> 14:21.650
[all grunting]

14:22.570 --> 14:26.391
Feel the power
of Belief, un-believers!

14:26.544 --> 14:29.934
[all grunting, crying out]

14:30.361 --> 14:32.207
Sam, dude,

14:32.427 --> 14:35.271
friends don't let friends
get crushed by nutjobs.

14:35.411 --> 14:37.192
You sure this is necessary?

14:37.379 --> 14:39.478
Answer me this first, Samuel.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.744
Do you believe they have
treated you as a friend?

14:42.970 --> 14:45.003
Well, they did try
to steal my helmet,

14:45.122 --> 14:47.151
and scare me by
getting into a fight.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.219
That doesn't mean
that you have to crush them.

14:49.411 --> 14:52.063
Not at all.
I merely intend to hold them

14:52.116 --> 14:54.774
and allow you to consult
the Patriarch.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.081
Seek him out
at these coordinates.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.968
Only the Patriarch
knows the path to your father.

15:01.216 --> 15:05.681
I believe you will do
whatever it takes to find him.

15:05.935 --> 15:09.816
[grunts] Don't fall for her mojo, kid!
[yells]

15:11.096 --> 15:12.591
Aahh!

15:15.476 --> 15:18.516
In this facility,
my "mojo," as you put it,

15:18.596 --> 15:20.195
is more powerful than ever.

15:20.315 --> 15:23.021
[all crying out]

15:23.094 --> 15:25.667
[grunts] So what are
Belief batteries doing

15:25.753 --> 15:28.613
in a Spartax military base?
[grunts]

15:28.679 --> 15:29.999
Haven't you guessed?

15:30.143 --> 15:34.591
The Spartax military
created the Believers.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.378
<i>After your interference towards my
plans to eliminate the Empror</i>

15:38.464 --> 15:42.493
<i>I was taken not to prison,
but to this top secret lab,</i>

15:42.534 --> 15:45.667
<i>along with other
mentally enhanced captives.</i>

15:51.119 --> 15:53.481
<i>They extracted
our psychic powers</i>

15:53.734 --> 15:56.446
<i>and converted them
into raw energy.</i>

16:03.115 --> 16:06.326
[screaming] <i>I thought
we were being punished.</i>

16:07.259 --> 16:09.245
<i>Until the Patriarch
enlightened us</i> [groans]

16:09.338 --> 16:11.667
<i>With the true power of Belief.</i>

16:15.685 --> 16:17.900
Now that energy is stored here,

16:18.010 --> 16:22.727
where it can be channeled and
molded at will by all who believe.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.195
[grunts]
So let me get this straight.

16:25.260 --> 16:29.107
Any loser who <i> believes</i> can access
the power of those batteries?

16:29.194 --> 16:32.033
Yes. That is the wonder
of Belief.

16:32.213 --> 16:35.830
Then I believe
I can kick your butt!

16:37.645 --> 16:38.645
[grunts]

16:39.527 --> 16:40.580
No!

16:40.665 --> 16:44.339
The power cannot be abused
by un-believers.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.298
We believe otherwise!

16:48.525 --> 16:50.304
[karate yells]

16:51.077 --> 16:53.630
Aw, man! I don't believe this!

16:53.770 --> 16:56.476
And that is why you will fail!

16:58.657 --> 17:01.748
[all] I believe there
is safety in numbers.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.333
[yelling]

17:15.732 --> 17:16.773
[grunts]

17:16.799 --> 17:18.307
[grunting]

17:21.546 --> 17:23.624
I am Groot!

17:27.476 --> 17:29.972
Who wants a stupid
Belief weapon anyway?

17:30.099 --> 17:31.974
[grunts]

17:32.141 --> 17:34.571
We do. And so does Mantis.

17:34.684 --> 17:36.357
[grunts]

17:42.962 --> 17:46.268
[grunts] If I can't have a
Belief weapon, then nobody will!

18:00.512 --> 18:02.060
[grunting]

18:02.152 --> 18:04.600
I believe you lose, lady.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.208
I am Groot.

18:07.235 --> 18:09.696
Now tell us where you sent Sam.

18:09.809 --> 18:11.933
And who is this "Patriarch"?

18:12.007 --> 18:15.199
[grunts] I still believe
I will triumph!

18:16.105 --> 18:19.429
Oh, I believe I know
exactly who he is.

18:24.141 --> 18:25.576
[guards grunt]

18:26.272 --> 18:28.019
Sorry... again.

18:28.123 --> 18:29.649
[guards groaning]

18:30.726 --> 18:32.006
Hello, Samuel.

18:32.105 --> 18:34.410
I've wanted to meet you
for a long time.

18:35.455 --> 18:36.985
How do you know who I am?

18:37.066 --> 18:39.172
You're Jesse Alexander's son,
aren't you?

18:39.279 --> 18:40.799
You know where to find my dad?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.285
I know a great deal
about the Nova Centurions.

18:43.412 --> 18:46.164
They're something of a...
Of a hobby of mine.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.906
Really? That hobby
end you up in here?

18:49.092 --> 18:50.745
You don't have to trust me,
Samuel.

18:50.814 --> 18:53.611
But with your power, you don't
have to fear me either.

18:53.744 --> 18:56.486
Free me, and I believe
I can find your father.

18:56.572 --> 18:59.125
[Quill] Not gonna happen,<i> Dad.</i>

19:01.217 --> 19:03.188
Wait. The Patriarch is your dad?

19:03.501 --> 19:05.501
J'Son of Spartax is many things.

19:05.614 --> 19:07.427
And you can't trust any of them.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.533
I am Groot.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.443
I'm impressed, Dad.
Why imprison your enemies

19:12.521 --> 19:15.396
when you can brainwash them
into your loyal servants?

19:15.808 --> 19:18.021
[thud] [grunts]

19:18.681 --> 19:22.542
The Guardians destroyed all your
Belief Batteries, Patriarch.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.701
But the Believers
will rise again!

19:24.835 --> 19:28.141
Forget it, bug lady.
The Believers are history.

19:28.285 --> 19:30.542
Haven't I taught you
anything, son?

19:30.696 --> 19:33.201
History is written
by the victors.

19:33.428 --> 19:36.236
Says the guy rotting
in a prison cell.

19:36.329 --> 19:38.989
Says the guy
who empowered the Believers

19:39.074 --> 19:42.447
and led them to revive an
ancient being known as Warlock,

19:42.665 --> 19:45.802
who will empower me
to bring peace to the galaxy,

19:45.975 --> 19:48.215
with an empire
a thousand times greater

19:48.248 --> 19:50.234
than the one
you took away from me!

19:50.354 --> 19:54.180
All while rotting
in this very prison cell.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.986
Yeah, well, not anymore.

19:57.086 --> 19:59.898
I tipped off the current
empress, your daughter Victoria.

20:00.025 --> 20:03.017
Remember her? Let's just
say your next prison cell

20:03.064 --> 20:05.174
is gonna make this one
look like a palace.

20:05.268 --> 20:07.893
Meantime, take one step
out of this cell,

20:07.918 --> 20:09.851
and I blast your royal heinie.

20:09.911 --> 20:13.483
I guess there will be no Alexander
family reunion after all.

20:13.736 --> 20:14.898
Pity.

20:15.391 --> 20:17.424
Don't listen to him, Sam.

20:17.503 --> 20:20.107
Remember how I told you
the galaxy's a dangerous place?

20:20.216 --> 20:23.621
Well, my dad is the most
dangerous guy in it.

20:23.674 --> 20:26.482
Yeah, I get it. You hate your dad.
But I don't hate mine.

20:26.547 --> 20:29.750
And all this junk has gotten
me no closer to finding him.

20:29.850 --> 20:31.721
The choice is yours, Samuel.

20:31.774 --> 20:33.356
Who do you believe?

20:36.898 --> 20:38.675
I'm so sorry.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.706
[all grunt]

20:43.819 --> 20:45.809
[all groaning]

20:49.202 --> 20:50.822
Well chosen, Samuel.

20:50.909 --> 20:54.117
Nothing can deter a loving son
from finding his father.

20:54.675 --> 20:57.943
You, of all people,
should know that, Peter.

21:06.444 --> 21:09.872
You are aiding the escape
of a convicted felon of Spartax.

21:09.916 --> 21:12.539
Halt, or we will open fire.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.580
Peter, we couldn't stop them, and
we have no way to trace them.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.473
Heh. Don't be so... [beeping]

21:23.545 --> 21:27.159
Oh, flarg! Krutackin' kid
disabled my tracker!

21:28.086 --> 21:32.453
This isn't over, Dad.
Not by a long shot.
