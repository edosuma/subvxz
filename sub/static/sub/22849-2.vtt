WEBVTT

00:15.375 --> 00:20.541
9 HOURS SINCE MIKKEL'S DISAPPEARANCE

01:50.833 --> 01:52.416
Jonas!

03:37.041 --> 03:38.958
LIES

03:39.041 --> 03:41.166
The victim is male, between 10 and 12.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.541
Time of death... about 16 hours ago.

03:44.916 --> 03:49.291
The burns around the eyes are strange.
Like they're melted.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.541
No signs of sexual abuse,

03:51.625 --> 03:53.500
no sperm, no foreign DNA.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.166
One thing is strange. Take a look.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.541
Apart from the burns,
the ear canals are destroyed.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.750
The inner ear was damaged too.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.625
Both eardrums have burst.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.416
From an extremely loud sound?

04:07.125 --> 04:08.958
Yes... Or pressure,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.541
caused by a nosedive.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.500
Or by intense rotation,
such as in a centrifuge.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.500
Do you know what otoconia are?

04:15.750 --> 04:17.666
Tiny grains in the ear canals

04:17.750 --> 04:20.125
that help us differentiate
between up and down.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.500
They can get confused.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.500
When the body rotates, for example.
We lose our balance.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.625
With this boy, none of the grains
are where they should be.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.000
Mikkel!

04:52.833 --> 04:54.166
Mikkel!

05:37.125 --> 05:38.583
Mikkel!

05:40.375 --> 05:41.500
Mikkel!

06:15.916 --> 06:17.166
What were you doing up there?

06:17.250 --> 06:18.833
Ouch! Are you crazy?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.333
What were you doing?

06:24.541 --> 06:26.375
I heard you guys talking at school.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.041
About the caves...

06:28.375 --> 06:30.083
and Erik's drugs...

06:30.625 --> 06:32.125
so I thought...

06:33.333 --> 06:35.125
I don't know what I thought.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.416
I'm sorry about Mikkel.

07:04.333 --> 07:09.333
Monday night in Winden,
another boy vanished without a trace.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.333
According to the police, the 11-year-old

07:12.416 --> 07:15.125
was last seen
with his siblings in Winden Forest

07:15.208 --> 07:18.250
near the nuclear power plant
and the Winden Caves.

07:18.708 --> 07:23.250
The police are asking the public for tips
that may help solve the case.

07:23.333 --> 07:28.333
Citizens' groups are also coordinating
searches with local authorities.

07:28.708 --> 07:33.416
For two weeks now, a 15-year-old boy
from the Winden area has been missing.

07:33.500 --> 07:39.125
Police have declined to comment on whether
the two missing persons cases are related.

07:50.625 --> 07:51.833
Hello.

07:52.416 --> 07:53.916
It's Mom.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.083
You're probably out.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.666
About Mikkel...

08:00.083 --> 08:02.500
I really don't know what to say.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.125
Are Martha and Magnus okay?

08:06.375 --> 08:07.708
Should we...

08:07.791 --> 08:09.541
Can we help?

08:10.125 --> 08:12.541
Call me when you hear this.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.250
We're very worried.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.375
Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.041
I...

08:29.708 --> 08:31.291
I couldn't get hold of Ulrich.

08:32.291 --> 08:33.916
Shouldn't we go see the kids?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.666
They've organized various search parties.
I have to go.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.333
Where were you last night?

08:44.250 --> 08:47.333
I woke up around midnight.
You weren't there.

08:47.416 --> 08:48.875
Couldn't sleep.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.875
I went into the garden
to get the bushes ready for winter.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.833
The car wasn't there either.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.791
We were out of cord.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.750
I had to go to the gas station.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.916
First Mads, now Mikkel.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.791
It's exactly like back then.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.958
When Dad's brother disappeared,
how old was he?

09:23.041 --> 09:24.291
MOTHER'S DAY 1986

09:24.416 --> 09:25.708
Your father was 15.

09:27.416 --> 09:29.750
Mads was three years younger.

09:33.916 --> 09:35.541
And he was never found?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.083
We talked about Erik.

09:49.916 --> 09:51.416
In the forest.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.958
Mikkel thought that was the worst.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.000
When someone isn't found.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.750
Mikkel's coming back.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.458
Definitely.

10:33.041 --> 10:36.041
Hey, this is Martha.
Leave a message after the beep.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.750
Hey, Martha.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.875
It's me.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.250
I, um...

10:45.416 --> 10:48.291
Just call me back, okay? Bye.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.083
The dead boy is neither Mikkel nor Erik.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.541
This kid is disfigured.
The eyes are completely burnt.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.375
There was red soil all over his clothes.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.666
But none where he was found.

11:05.541 --> 11:09.250
And it looks as if someone
dressed the boy in clothes from the '80s.

11:10.708 --> 11:13.583
The shoes, the Walkman...
From the '80s as well.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.125
We found this around his neck:

11:16.208 --> 11:19.791
a one-pfennig coin from 1986
on a red cord.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.083
The cassette contains this.

11:26.250 --> 11:31.000
We fall through the time stream
Then awaken from a dream

11:38.375 --> 11:41.875
-And Mikkel and Erik?
-Wöller will coordinate the search.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.458
For now we won't make
the discovery of the body public.

11:44.541 --> 11:48.083
We've got two missing kids
and a dead, unidentified boy.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.708
Contact the central office
for missing persons.

11:50.791 --> 11:53.250
Question everyone in the proximity.
Everyone!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.583
In the cave... there's a door!
I found a door.

11:57.541 --> 11:58.541
Can I have a word?

12:04.416 --> 12:07.458
There's a door inside the cave,
leading to the nuclear plant.

12:07.958 --> 12:12.166
We need a search warrant. Maybe Mikkel
accessed the grounds through that door.

12:12.916 --> 12:15.458
That's a high security area.
You can't just enter.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.583
-Maybe he climbed the fence.
-The barbed wire?

12:18.666 --> 12:22.125
We checked the fence.
There was no damage to it.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.541
You're thinking the same thing, right?

12:24.833 --> 12:28.333
That the cases are all connected.
The dead boy, Erik, Mikkel.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.958
Maybe you were right.
It's just like it was back then.

12:33.041 --> 12:36.208
Mads disappeared at the same spot.
Close to the nuclear power plant.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.291
Something is wrong up there...
I just know it.

12:40.083 --> 12:40.958
Okay.

12:41.541 --> 12:43.791
I'll request the search warrant.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.250
The police will be here soon.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.833
We need to get rid of them tonight,
Jürgen.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.125
Tonight.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.291
They'll be snooping all over here.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.041
Maybe someone else should do it.

13:19.708 --> 13:22.916
Because of Erik...
They'll be watching.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.625
Are you blackmailing me?

13:26.916 --> 13:28.416
No, why?

13:31.208 --> 13:34.791
Do you know the difference between
successful and unsuccessful people?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.541
Exactly.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.416
So do it tonight.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.625
And you talk to no one.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.125
Understood?

13:55.041 --> 13:57.958
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

14:14.041 --> 14:15.750
Can I help you?

14:16.833 --> 14:18.333
I need a room.

15:26.791 --> 15:30.333
Must be horrible for you.
First, the thing with your son Mads...

15:32.208 --> 15:33.916
and now your grandson.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.375
But...

15:35.458 --> 15:37.375
the whole town is mobilizing.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.875
We'll find him.

15:39.541 --> 15:40.750
Maybe.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.833
Maybe not.

17:29.583 --> 17:33.375
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

18:39.333 --> 18:40.666
Ulrich, it's me Charlotte.

18:41.041 --> 18:44.625
Aleksander blocked
the search warrant immediately.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.750
But we're talking to the judge now.
Please call me back once you hear this.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.166
END CALL

22:09.708 --> 22:12.500
WINDEN CAVES

22:13.208 --> 22:18.916
And so, at least hypothetically,
because of these gravitational anomalies,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.750
it is possible to bend time and space.

22:25.041 --> 22:31.625
Will we ever be able to travel through
a black hole to see what lies beyond?

22:32.750 --> 22:37.916
And what price would we pay?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.250
How far would scientists go?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.708
Aleksander, please open the gate.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.833
Let me in.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.875
There's a door in the caves.
Maybe he got through it.

23:08.166 --> 23:11.458
Let me search the slope.
Let me search your section of the caves!

23:11.875 --> 23:13.166
Please.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.041
I can't just let anyone in there.

23:15.458 --> 23:17.291
It's a high security area.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.875
My employees patrol it every day.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.458
If Mikkel were here, we'd know it.

23:24.708 --> 23:25.875
You fucking asshole!

23:26.958 --> 23:29.333
Why are you doing this?
Are you trying to ruin me?

23:29.416 --> 23:31.166
We're talking about my son!

23:31.250 --> 23:33.625
I'm coming back with a search warrant!

23:33.708 --> 23:37.083
And then you'll open this goddamn gate!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.208
You asshole!

23:39.583 --> 23:40.833
Open up!

23:41.541 --> 23:43.166
I'm sorry, Ulrich.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.541
-Honestly.
-Open up, man!

24:28.250 --> 24:30.458
ENTER CODE - 3 ATTEMPTS REMAINING

24:35.208 --> 24:36.666
INVALID CODE - 2 ATTEMPTS REMAINING

24:57.708 --> 24:59.541
What are you doing here?

25:00.750 --> 25:02.583
-I wanted to see you.
-Come on.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.541
What is this?

25:14.333 --> 25:15.958
Why are you here?

25:17.333 --> 25:18.833
I'm so sorry.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.125
Have you found out anything?

25:43.291 --> 25:44.916
Stop it, please.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.250
Please.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.916
I can't do this, not now.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.208
I'll call you, okay?

26:42.083 --> 26:45.125
WHERE IS THE CROSSING?

27:06.666 --> 27:08.833
Car unidentified, unidentified...

27:12.666 --> 27:14.791
"Identification: Van"?

27:16.250 --> 27:18.125
Obendorf has a van...

27:22.958 --> 27:24.291
POLICE RECORDS

27:38.458 --> 27:41.250
Jankowski! Did you question Obendorf?

27:41.333 --> 27:42.916
Yes. Why?

27:43.000 --> 27:47.041
The files say he was on duty at the plant
when Erik disappeared.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.375
He works in the storerooms
and as a driver sometimes.

27:50.458 --> 27:52.625
-Did you confirm that?
-Of course.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.750
So he has access
to the power plant grounds?

27:56.208 --> 27:59.250
-I think so.
-Was he at the plant last night too?

28:00.458 --> 28:02.000
No idea.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.916
I haven't spoken to him yet.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.416
Drop it.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.125
Drop it, I said!

32:05.083 --> 32:06.166
Ulrich!

32:15.625 --> 32:16.666
What is this?

32:21.083 --> 32:22.625
Is this yours?

32:26.250 --> 32:27.750
We did it together.

32:29.583 --> 32:30.666
Erik and I.

32:31.708 --> 32:34.125
We sold some at the school.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.708
Were you at the plant yesterday?

32:42.166 --> 32:43.916
Yesterday? No, why?

32:53.791 --> 32:54.666
What's this?

32:55.000 --> 32:58.458
When people bring their junk here,
you always find something.

32:59.125 --> 33:01.458
Erik was saving up for a scooter.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.000
Where's my boy?

33:18.666 --> 33:19.916
I don't know, Jürgen.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.583
Do you think they'll find him?

34:35.791 --> 34:36.666
I hope so.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.083
Do you think he had a secret?

34:48.666 --> 34:49.500
Mikkel?

34:50.583 --> 34:51.541
No, Dad.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.958
Do you think
he was keeping something from us?

34:58.625 --> 34:59.833
Why do you say that?

35:05.416 --> 35:06.375
Do you miss him?

35:10.791 --> 35:13.083
I think I miss a notion of him.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.375
I don't know who he really was.

35:19.916 --> 35:21.541
Maybe we never know that.

35:23.833 --> 35:25.666
What a person is really like.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.291
Did you love him?

36:35.083 --> 36:37.625
Whatever happens,
you'll tell me the truth.

36:40.791 --> 36:41.958
Don't lie to me.

36:43.208 --> 36:44.333
Whatever it is.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.333
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

38:38.375 --> 38:42.125
WHEN IS MIKKEL?

40:35.291 --> 40:36.333
Who are you?

40:37.541 --> 40:39.208
Why? Who are you?

40:39.291 --> 40:40.125
Mikkel.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.291
I live here.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.625
Ulrich. And I live here.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.041
You going to grow roots?

40:48.666 --> 40:51.625
-You're at the wrong house, fool.
-Hey, Ulrich!

40:51.916 --> 40:53.333
Come on, we need to go.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.958
Yes, Katharina, I'm coming.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.583
Are you dense? You don't live here.

41:06.625 --> 41:07.458
Who is that?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.916
The Grim Reaper. Can't you tell?

41:12.500 --> 41:14.000
Ouch! Katharina.
