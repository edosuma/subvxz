Maybe Captain Underpants
left something behind

Oh, wait, there's a button.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.503
Gotta put these robes in the dryer
with some Bed of Robeses

11:10.586 --> 11:12.546

11:12.630 --> 11:14.924
So, you are the one
framing Captain Underpants.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.550
You're the impostor.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.428
No, Mr. Ree isn't the impostor.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.807
I am the impostor!

11:22.890 --> 11:23.950
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.895
Sorry, I'll walk you through it.
Once, I was a troublemaking alien robe.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.940
But Captain Underpants punched me
into toxic waste,

11:31.023 --> 11:34.026
making me a super robe with his powers.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.987
I wanted to rule
and I couldn't let him stop me again.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.658
So I took over Mr. Ree's body
and used his skills of invention

11:40.741 --> 11:42.701
to create Bed of Robeses,

11:42.785 --> 11:47.289

all robes and those who wear them.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.709
Then, I posed as Captain Underpants
to frame him

11:50.793 --> 11:53.087
and get rid of the only one
who could defeat me.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.132
Now my robal domination is at hand.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.360
- Nice drawings.
- Did you do those?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.553
- Never mind that!
- So, no.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.847
So you're like an evil version
of Captain Underpants?

12:02.930 --> 12:05.975

12:08.936 --> 12:13.983
Yes. Splotch.
That is a good name. I'm using it.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.902
Good. But we're not gonna let you
take over the world with robes.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.531
Captain Underpants will stop you.
As soon as we get him out of jail.

12:20.656 --> 12:25.786
Oh? And how will you do that
if you can't leave?

12:27.663 --> 12:28.703

12:33.294 --> 12:34.295
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:34.378 --> 12:39.008
I need to get to Robe-I-Con

I've turned the robes of Robe-I-Con
into a robe-nado!

19:10.315 --> 19:11.316
We just said that.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.694
What? Oh, sorry, I... It's very loud.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.822
Whoa, oh!

19:16.905 --> 19:21.285
I like spinny rides, but not this one!

19:21.368 --> 19:24.246
Go the other way.
Fly against the robe-o-flow!

19:24.413 --> 19:25.289
[beeping]

19:25.372 --> 19:26.850
- [narrator] <i>Sorry.</i>
- [beeping continues]

19:26.874 --> 19:28.250
[thunder rumbles]

19:29.042 --> 19:33.088
[grunting]

19:33.172 --> 19:37.009
I'm flying righty-tighty-whitey
and it's not working!

19:37.176 --> 19:38.886
Ow, ow, ow!

19:38.969 --> 19:41.138
Those robes bit my butt!

19:41.221 --> 19:42.097
Actually...

19:42.181 --> 19:43.932
<i>♪ It wasn't a bite, it was a shock ♪</i>

19:44.016 --> 19:46.435
<i>♪ Because when robes rub your butt ♪</i>

19:46.518 --> 19:50.981
<i>♪ You create static electricity,
Electricity ♪</i>

19:51.064 --> 19:52.232
I gotta get out of here!

19:52.399 --> 19:53.817
No, you need to get in there

19:53.901 --> 19:56.153
- and create a bigger shock!
- With your butt.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.780
Oh, okay. That was my Plan B.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.658
- [static crackles]
- Ooh! Tingly.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.160
Wha?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.494
[grunts]

20:04.786 --> 20:05.786
[grunts]

20:06.121 --> 20:08.874
Wait! There's junk on my trunk!

20:08.999 --> 20:12.377
Good work, robes.
You're winning butt first.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.673
Oh, no. I'm losing butt first!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.134
Uh-oh! [grunts]

20:19.218 --> 20:23.847
Too soft! Too luxurious! Can't breathe!

20:23.931 --> 20:25.057
[muffled grunting]

20:25.140 --> 20:26.975
What? Why isn't it working?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.645
<i>- ♪ Sometimes it's shocky ♪
- ♪ Shocky ♪</i>

20:29.728 --> 20:31.647
<i>- ♪ Sometimes it's clingy ♪
- ♪ Clingy ♪</i>

20:31.730 --> 20:34.233
It's clingy.
We need to get rid of the static cling

20:34.316 --> 20:36.944
before Captain Underpants drowns
in fluffiness.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.528
- With this?
- Where'd you get those?

20:38.612 --> 20:41.073
- Right over there.
- [George] Free Bed of Robeses?

20:41.156 --> 20:42.449
Talk about a lucky break.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.451
Let them fly!

20:51.708 --> 20:54.169
- Well, that didn't work.
- Why'd we think that would work?

20:54.253 --> 20:58.090
[narrator] <i>Because dryer sheets,
even evil ones, fight static cling.</i>

20:59.466 --> 21:01.260
Huh. Oh, yeah. It did work.

21:02.094 --> 21:06.390
[grunts] Well, that was a close one.
I thought my butt was a goner.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.393
Your butt is a goner!

21:09.476 --> 21:12.062
The robe-olution has just begun.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.815
- Robes rule!
- [both scream]

21:15.649 --> 21:19.778
To disrobe the robes,
we gotta disrobe the robe ruler, Splotch.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.782
A wedgie whip will work wonders.
Wedgie whip will work wonders.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.158
Hmm. That's hard to say.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.952
Wedgie whip will work wonders!

21:27.911 --> 21:31.039
[grunting]

21:42.259 --> 21:43.176
Oh!

21:43.260 --> 21:44.136
Robe-I-Con.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.055
Wonder if they got any kimonos.
Robe-I-Con!

21:47.514 --> 21:48.348
[chuckles] Yeah.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.516
[snarling]

21:51.560 --> 21:52.769
We'll take it from here.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.853
- Robius!
- Robius!

21:53.895 --> 21:55.689
This alien robe must be contained.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.067
So, we'll contain it
in our special containment container.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.777
[all] Okay.

22:00.861 --> 22:06.408
And for your bravery, I'm inviting you
to join the Society of Robes.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.495
- Thanks, but we're taking a robe recess.
- Maybe next year.

22:10.579 --> 22:14.082
Uh, that is way too much fabric for me.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.502
Can't put a curtain on this window.
[chuckles] Right?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.546
Very well. I bid you good robings.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.049
Wait! We'll take those robes.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.843
And we'd be honored to join your society.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.970
Let us rub elbows with the fat cats.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.263
Hmm.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.681
Maybe next year.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.892
[gasps] Giuseppe!

22:32.601 --> 22:34.361
[Robius] Your alien owners
will be here soon.

22:34.394 --> 22:37.689
Until then, I hope you get along
with your new cell mate.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.694
