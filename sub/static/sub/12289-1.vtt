WEBVTT

00:32.766 --> 00:33.733
- Come on Joe!

00:33.734 --> 00:34.867
- Yeah, I'm behind you!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.001
- Move, move!

00:36.002 --> 00:37.036
- I'm behind you!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.372
- Run, fucking run!

00:53.820 --> 00:54.820
- Rachel, wait!

00:54.821 --> 00:56.588
Wait, we have to go get Tom!

00:56.589 --> 00:57.557
- No, we have to go!

00:57.558 --> 00:58.657
- We have to go get Tom.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.261
- No, we have to get outta here!

01:24.417 --> 01:25.884
- My name is Howard Redman.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.153
I was a Mythological
Studies Professor

01:28.154 --> 01:31.491
at the university of
Westerham, England.

01:32.692 --> 01:33.959
What you're about to
see is what remains

01:33.960 --> 01:37.230
of footage of Rachel
Kusia and her team,

01:38.097 --> 01:40.100
filmed on the day they died.

01:42.535 --> 01:46.039
Two years ago, Rachel,
one of my students,

01:47.640 --> 01:50.810
went to Romania to
film a documentary to
support her thesis.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.948
She was completely obsessed with

01:55.949 --> 01:59.519
the myths surrounding
the Hoia Baciu forest

02:00.720 --> 02:03.456
and wanted to prove
that they were true.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.327
She assembled a small
camera crew and found

02:08.328 --> 02:11.397
a local guide who
agreed to take them

02:12.265 --> 02:14.167
to the heart of the forest.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.871
She left in November 2012 and...

02:19.038 --> 02:21.241
That was the last
time I saw her.

02:23.443 --> 02:27.614
I knew something was wrong
when she missed her deadline.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.782
When I found out that the guide

02:30.783 --> 02:33.719
and the camera crew
were also missing,

02:33.720 --> 02:37.891
I took it upon myself to go to
Romania and search for them.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.597
I wish I'd never set
foot in that forest.

02:45.598 --> 02:49.769
It's not just a forest, the
stories aren't just stories.

02:51.204 --> 02:54.140
The forest looks into
your soul and judges you.

02:55.742 --> 02:56.910
And it decides

02:58.912 --> 03:01.014
if you live or if you die.

03:08.888 --> 03:12.325
Eventually I found
the camera in the snow

03:13.526 --> 03:16.194
and I was able to
watch the footage.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.699
I saw what happened
to them in the forest.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.469
And I saw their deaths.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.948
What you are about to
see is unedited footage.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.583
I know that Rachel
would've wanted

03:37.584 --> 03:40.687
the world to know
that she was right.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.460
I don't know why the
forest let me live.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.832
But after what I've seen...

03:53.666 --> 03:55.668
The footage, the forest.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.040
I don't know if I want to.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.373
- This should be it, man.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.374
- Yep.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.014
Where is she?

05:33.266 --> 05:36.502
- I really
don't want to be here.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.103
- Relax.

05:44.877 --> 05:46.144
- Woah!

05:46.145 --> 05:48.046
- Dude, it's her!
- Yeah.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.382
- Finally!

05:51.184 --> 05:52.852
- Startled me.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.354
- Hi!
- - Hi.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.354
- Hey.

05:55.988 --> 05:56.923
- Nice ride.
- - Yeah.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.256
You got something better?

05:58.257 --> 05:59.925
- Ah, not quite, I took the bus.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.993
- Cheaper.
- - Yeah. I'm Rachel.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.562
- I'm Joe, the camera guy.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.230
- I can see that.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.365
- Tom.
- - Rachel.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.699
I suppose you're the sound guy?

06:07.700 --> 06:10.136
- Yep.
- - Great.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.905
There's a place down the
hill where you can park.

06:13.906 --> 06:14.940
- There's a bar.
- - Ooh.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.208
- Maybe we can meet inside?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.609
- Yeah, yeah.
- - Definitely.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.077
- Cool, cool.
- - See ya.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.512
- See ya down there.
- - See ya there.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.014
- Bye.
- - Bye.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.260
- Well, I guess
it's down the hill.

06:35.261 --> 06:37.162
- That's what the lady said.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.499
- Well, cheers to you.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.636
- Cheers, man.
- - Cheers.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.307
- Fuck!
- - Ugh!

06:49.942 --> 06:50.942
Jesus!

06:52.044 --> 06:53.044
Wow!

06:54.547 --> 06:56.181
- Dude, this is evil.

06:56.182 --> 07:00.019
- Yeah, I think
this is the plum brandy.

07:06.726 --> 07:07.726
- It burns.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.127
Fuck.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.096
- Yeah, well, here,

07:11.097 --> 07:12.230
have your camera back.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.532
I don't want it anymore.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.699
Your precious baby.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.636
- Yeah, come here baby.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.772
- I think I'll have some more.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.008
- Really?

07:26.145 --> 07:27.646
Quit the drinking
man, come on, stop it.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.548
- Dude, I wanna
get wasted tonight.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.116
- Shut up.
- - Like really wasted.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.618
- We have a really,
really long day tomorrow.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.587
Shut up, shut up.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.954
- We have to get wasted on this.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.455
- Dude dude dude.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.623
- This is the best shit
that ever happened to us!

07:38.624 --> 07:39.691
I swear to God!

07:39.692 --> 07:40.892
- Shut up, you're drunk.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.761
- Tom, you're drunk.
- - I'm not drunk!

07:42.762 --> 07:45.197
- Okay, I'm not drunk.
- - Stop.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.199
- I'm sober.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.799
I'm sober.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.734
So let's have some fun!

07:49.735 --> 07:51.236
- Shut up Tom.
- - Come on.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.904
- Seriously, come
on man, shut the fuck up.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.306
- You're being a pussy.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.908
- No I'm not!

07:58.845 --> 08:00.880
Ah, good morning Romania!

08:08.287 --> 08:10.623
- Joe.
- Yeah?

08:14.193 --> 08:17.362
- I get the feeling
that your sidekick

08:17.363 --> 08:18.964
doesn't like me much.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.367
- Well, don't mind him.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.803
He's just, well, he's just not
a morning person, that's all.

08:24.804 --> 08:28.373
- Maybe if he hadn't
drunk so much last night.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.608
- You know I can hear everything

08:29.609 --> 08:31.444
you little lovebirds
are saying, right?

08:33.479 --> 08:36.381
- Can you hear this, asshole?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.191
- Come on.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.466
- Ready?
- - Ready.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.467
- Let's go.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.208
Tom?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.044
- Tom!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.282
- What are you doing?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.018
- It's go time!

09:21.093 --> 09:22.528
- Uh, pick it up.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.830
- Why?

09:28.334 --> 09:29.334
- Because.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.938
I want you to pick it up.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.709
- You gotta be kidding me.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.080
- Yeah, that's
a good boy, Tommy.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.948
- I wanna get this straight.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.817
I don't want either of you
guys messing around, okay?

09:45.818 --> 09:47.819
- Yeah, we're cool, we're cool.

09:47.820 --> 09:48.820
- Good.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.527
- So what's up?

09:55.528 --> 09:56.995
- No dicking around Tom.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.864
- Tom, I want you to
know this is serious.

09:59.865 --> 10:03.101
This is my job, this is my
first independent assignment.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.503
Don't fuck it up!

10:05.237 --> 10:06.237
Okay?

10:06.739 --> 10:07.739
- Okay.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.509
- Good, I wanna hear you say it.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.715
- I won't fuck it up.
- - Great.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.823
- Man, why is she
picking on me, huh?

10:24.824 --> 10:27.226
- Give her a break Tom.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.196
- I know what you're thinking.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.897
But that bitch is way
out of your league.

10:32.898 --> 10:36.034
- Woah woah woah, I
ain't thinking anything, okay?

10:36.035 --> 10:39.204
Look, she obviously under a
lot of pressure right now,

10:39.205 --> 10:41.641
just lay off her a bit, okay?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.176
- Dude, I don't
give a shit, okay?

10:45.177 --> 10:47.913
I'm just the sound
guy, fuck her!

10:54.587 --> 10:57.756
- Guys, look.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.426
Excuse me, do you speak English?

11:00.893 --> 11:01.893
- Yes.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.429
- Have you ever
been to Baciu Forest?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.432
- No.
- - Why not?

11:07.299 --> 11:09.334
- Because it's an evil place.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.769
- How can you
say it's an evil place

11:10.770 --> 11:12.938
if you haven't been there?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.975
- Well, my sister, she has.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.845
- And what happened to her?

11:21.047 --> 11:22.480
- She really doesn't
like to speak about it,

11:22.481 --> 11:24.449
but she's never been the same.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.317
She was in the forest
for five hours,

11:26.318 --> 11:29.120
but she looked like she had
been there for five months.

11:29.121 --> 11:32.691
She had this horrible
rash, like red spots,

11:33.426 --> 11:34.827
all over the arm.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.062
And she was sick.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.097
And she kept saying that the
forest was trying to kill her.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.365
- Trying to kill her?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.100
- Yeah, like punish
her for something.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.301
- Did she tell you why

11:43.302 --> 11:44.270
the forest was
trying to kill her?

11:44.271 --> 11:45.537
- No, she really doesn't.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.539
No, she doesn't like
to speak about it.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.307
- I understand.
- - I don't know.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.142
- How did she get out of there?

11:51.143 --> 11:53.579
- I think she was just lucky.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.213
She got lucky.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.348
- Do you believe her?

11:57.349 --> 12:00.653
- Yeah, she's my
sister, why wouldn't I?

12:01.587 --> 12:03.289
Of course I do.
- Yes.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.124
- Sorry, I really need to go.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.326
- Thank you very much!

12:08.327 --> 12:09.829
- Thank you.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.333
- That was a good one.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.756
Okay.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.131
The Forest Baciu.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.073
- Most of them believe in God.
- - Okay.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.683
- So all kinds of religion.

13:13.425 --> 13:17.095
He heard something happened
in the Baciu Forest.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.165
A meteorite or something.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.626
- So you think it's haunted?

13:49.061 --> 13:52.665
- Not really haunted, I
don't believe in haunted.

13:53.432 --> 13:54.934
But it is strange.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.479
- Tell me anything you
know about the forest.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.217
- Well I've heard that the
trees don't have shadows.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.218
- Okay.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.023
- Some of my friends
got lost there

14:19.225 --> 14:22.093
and they saw some lights
or something like that.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.495
- Lights. What kind of lights?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.398
- I don't know exactly.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.776
- Tell me about the forest.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.045
Anything you know.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.282
- It's haunted.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.854
So if you go inside
the red spots

14:49.855 --> 14:51.923
start to appear on your skin.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.391
- Do you know why?

14:53.392 --> 14:54.994
- I don't know why.

14:55.594 --> 14:56.629
I just heard.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.931
Just what I read
in the newspaper.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.366
- Have you ever
been in the forest?

15:01.367 --> 15:02.367
- No. No.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.603
- Are you scared,
thinking about the forest?

15:05.604 --> 15:08.274
- No, but I don't want to go in.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.577
I don't want to
go in the forest.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.612
- Do you know
anyone who got into

15:13.613 --> 15:15.246
the forest and never came out?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.247
- No.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.185
All of those things are...

15:22.321 --> 15:24.122
In my opinion, are stories.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.190
Only stories.

15:34.967 --> 15:38.703
- Okay, tell me anything
you know about Baciu Forest.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.071
Do you think it's haunted?

15:40.072 --> 15:42.206
- I don't believe in this one.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.675
I think it's a rumor.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.613
Everybody talks about it's
haunted, it's full of ghosts.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.882
And sometimes UFO.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.717
But I don't believe it.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.018
- Have you ever
been in the forest?

15:54.019 --> 15:54.853
- Yeah, once.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.054
- And what happened?

15:56.055 --> 15:58.323
- We got drunk.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.324
- And nothing happened?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.825
- Nothing happened.

16:00.826 --> 16:04.396
We searched every tree and
there was nobody there.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.564
- Okay, no noises?

16:06.565 --> 16:10.669
- Just us, very drunk.

16:11.937 --> 16:15.673
- Stories about anyone
missing into the woods?

16:15.674 --> 16:16.674
- No, no.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.846
Missing dogs, missing
cats, but not people.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
- Okay.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.582
So you're totally
skeptical about this?

16:24.583 --> 16:25.684
- Yeah, yeah.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.553
- Stories.
- - Yeah.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.621
- Okay. Thank you very much.

16:30.622 --> 16:31.957
- Quite welcome.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.465
- I want to thank you

16:40.466 --> 16:42.533
very much for coming here today.

16:42.534 --> 16:43.936
- You're welcome.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.571
- I know you're an expert

16:46.572 --> 16:49.006
and you know a lot of
things about Baciu Forest.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.007
Is that so?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.844
- Well, I wouldn't exactly
call myself and expert,

16:52.845 --> 16:56.548
but I have been studying the
forest for some years now.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.616
- Good.

16:58.617 --> 17:01.152
Can you tell us, what have
you discovered in the forest?

17:01.153 --> 17:02.721
- Where do I begin?

17:03.589 --> 17:05.457
Well I have been noticing some

17:06.325 --> 17:08.259
abrupt changes in weather there.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.096
And people claim
they hear noises,

17:12.297 --> 17:14.933
or their phone losing
signal for no reason.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.069
And also, there
have been some...

17:18.936 --> 17:21.272
Reports of people gone missing.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.576
- People gone missing?

17:25.978 --> 17:27.546
Explain that to me.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.147
How come?

17:29.982 --> 17:30.916
- Well it's not really
uncommon for some tourist

17:30.917 --> 17:33.084
to go in the woods and get lost

17:33.085 --> 17:36.120
or some local to go
missing in the forest.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.756
Actually, the forest is
named after a shepherd,

17:38.757 --> 17:41.559
who went in there with his
entire flock and went missing.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.928
But this was many,
many years ago.

17:43.929 --> 17:46.831
- Yes, but people
don't just disappear.

17:46.832 --> 17:47.832
Do they?

17:48.834 --> 17:50.468
- Not really, but you
see, in these parts,

17:50.469 --> 17:53.004
there is a belief that
if you go into the forest

17:53.005 --> 17:55.340
with darkness in your heart,

17:56.508 --> 17:59.343
your inner demons will
manifest themselves

17:59.344 --> 18:02.281
and you will be
judged and punished.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.918
- That's a little melodramatic!

18:08.353 --> 18:09.921
- That may be, but you see,

18:09.922 --> 18:12.557
the people that went
in there and came back,

18:12.558 --> 18:13.858
were interviewed by us.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.293
And even though
we haven't really

18:15.294 --> 18:17.696
reached a conclusive verdict,

18:18.564 --> 18:20.766
they all claimed the forest can

18:21.900 --> 18:22.701
see in their souls,
in their hearts,

18:22.702 --> 18:24.602
and knows their secrets.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.003
But I don't really believe this,

18:26.004 --> 18:27.772
I think it's just mass
hysteria and panic

18:27.773 --> 18:29.273
that causes the brain to induce

18:29.274 --> 18:32.177
these hallucinations
and delusions.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.648
I refer to this as
The Devil Complex.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.396
- Joe.
- Yeah?

18:52.397 --> 18:55.266
- Get a close up of the house.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.335
- Yeah.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.069
- Great.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.709
- My God, look at the windows.
- - Yeah.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.678
- Yeah, this house looks
just like your old dollhouse.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.447
- Yeah, screw you Tom!

19:09.448 --> 19:11.750
- Maybe you and Uncle
Fester can come here and live?

19:13.051 --> 19:15.153
- I see someone.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.721
Come on.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.293
Can you speak to me
about the forest?

19:22.294 --> 19:25.296
- About the Baciu Forest?
- - Yes!

19:25.297 --> 19:27.131
- It's not a good place.

19:27.132 --> 19:29.800
- You shouldn't go in.
- - Why?

19:29.801 --> 19:31.002
- People die there.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.638
They go in and they
never come back.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.575
- Okay, we have a guide,
Mr. Dogaru, do you know him?

19:37.576 --> 19:40.846
- They say he once
beat his wife so bad

19:42.014 --> 19:44.917
she went in there
and never came back.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.418
- Okay thank you.
- - So be careful.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.254
- Thank you very much.

19:49.955 --> 19:50.955
Jesus!

19:59.264 --> 20:00.665
- Where's the boom?

20:00.666 --> 20:03.034
- I don't see the
point of bringing it.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.302
- Joe.
- - Yeah?

20:04.303 --> 20:05.736
- We need as much
footage as we can,

20:05.737 --> 20:07.205
so keep rolling, no matter what.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.375
- You keep recording, okay?
- - Okay.

20:11.109 --> 20:11.777
- No matter what.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.878
No matter what.

20:13.612 --> 20:14.279
What did you expect?

20:14.279 --> 20:15.214
- From you?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.447
Nothing much.

20:16.448 --> 20:19.051
I expect you to prove me wrong.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.888
- Rachel, who's that?

20:24.022 --> 20:26.825
- That's our
guide, Mr. Dogaru.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.071
- Let's go.
- - Yeah, okay.

20:39.838 --> 20:40.838
Right behind you.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.510
- Mr. Dogaru?

20:53.285 --> 20:57.456
I'm Rachel, the Professor
arranged for us to meet today.

21:06.698 --> 21:07.698
A little.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.169
If we speak Romanian.

21:15.474 --> 21:16.541
- I'm Tom.

21:17.576 --> 21:18.477
Hey, Jesus!

21:18.478 --> 21:19.777
Why did you spit on me?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.513
Now that's just rude!

21:22.948 --> 21:24.649
- Can I ask you,
why did you spit on him?

21:24.650 --> 21:25.650
Like that?

21:27.586 --> 21:29.755
- Here we spit three times

21:31.423 --> 21:33.759
to scare off sacred spirits.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.295
- Oh, I understand.

21:38.730 --> 21:42.600
Do you believe the stories
they tell about the forest?

21:42.601 --> 21:43.601
The myths?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.303
- Myths?

21:46.371 --> 21:49.975
- Yes, like the
forest knows your soul?

22:00.018 --> 22:01.719
- I've had
enough of her already.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.824
You don't say?

22:06.992 --> 22:09.861
- Dude, this place
gives me the creeps.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.633
And that man, that man
definitely gives me the creeps.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.301
I mean, think about it.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.337
If he believes in
all that ghost crap,

22:19.338 --> 22:22.373
why did he agree to bring
us here in the first place?

22:22.374 --> 22:23.607
- I don't know, man.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.843
Maybe he just needs the
money, just like you?

22:25.844 --> 22:26.912
- Sure, sure.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.246
You keep telling yourself that

22:29.247 --> 22:31.349
as the wife-beating murderer
keeps leading us further

22:31.350 --> 22:35.120
and further into
the mother-fucking
middle of nowhere!

22:36.988 --> 22:40.258
- You're such
a drama queen dude.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.993
If you're that
concerned about it,

22:42.994 --> 22:45.162
just take it up with
Rachel, I don't know.

22:45.163 --> 22:48.432
- Yeah, now how come
I didn't think of that?

22:48.433 --> 22:50.634
I should definitely take it
up with your new girlfriend.

22:50.635 --> 22:53.138
- Jesus, give it a rest.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.624
What is up with
the weather, man?

23:14.459 --> 23:16.994
- So how long
is this going to take?

23:16.995 --> 23:20.331
- I don't know,
couple of hours I guess.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.902
It depends on how much
it is to the circle.

23:25.203 --> 23:26.471
- Circle?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.372
What circle?

23:28.373 --> 23:30.040
- You didn't do any research?

23:30.041 --> 23:33.644
- Yeah I did, I researched
my X-box all week.

23:33.645 --> 23:37.281
- Okay, so
there's supposed to
be this circle, okay?

23:37.282 --> 23:41.453
Where nothing grows, like the
ground is dead or something.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.188
- Dead?
- - Yeah.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.723
- That's impossible!

23:45.590 --> 23:46.824
- Well, go ask Rachel.

23:46.825 --> 23:50.261
She probably knows how
much further it is too.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.462
- I think you should go ask her,

23:51.463 --> 23:53.898
I mean, she's your
new girlfriend right?

23:53.899 --> 23:54.899
Ow!

23:57.068 --> 23:58.969
You always love these
miserable bitches.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.672
Ow, Jesus, that hurt!

24:01.873 --> 24:04.308
- Please Tom,
just focus on the job.

24:04.309 --> 24:06.944
- Yeah yeah, like you're
focusing on Rachel's ass?

24:06.945 --> 24:07.945
- Am not!

24:11.016 --> 24:12.183
Seriously Tom, game face.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.119
- Yeah yeah, game face.

24:14.986 --> 24:15.921
At least I have a game face.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.422
All you have is an ugly face!

24:20.425 --> 24:21.559
- Hey Rachel!

24:21.560 --> 24:22.760
- Yeah?

24:22.761 --> 24:24.830
- How much further?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.733
- How far is the circle?

24:29.734 --> 24:33.238
- Depends.
- On what?

24:33.972 --> 24:35.474
- Where it is today.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.810
- Bullshit.
- - What?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.153
Where's Tom?

24:48.887 --> 24:50.387
- I don't know.

24:50.388 --> 24:51.388
Tom!

24:52.190 --> 24:54.124
- Tom!
- Tom!

24:54.125 --> 24:56.227
- Hold on, I'm taking a piss!

24:56.228 --> 24:58.463
- Ah.
- Okay.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.409
Ouch! Shit!

25:33.431 --> 25:34.432
- Wow.

25:39.404 --> 25:40.906
I've never seen...

25:42.274 --> 25:44.675
I've just never seen
weather like this before.

25:44.676 --> 25:45.876
It's just...

25:45.877 --> 25:49.146
- Dude, this place
give me the creeps.

25:49.147 --> 25:52.484
That man definitely
gives me the creeps.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.282
- Unbelievable.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.551
- Joe!
- - What, what?

27:02.654 --> 27:04.655
- Can you see that?

27:04.656 --> 27:06.224
- What is it?

27:09.628 --> 27:10.928
- It's a stuffed bear.

27:10.929 --> 27:11.996
- Really?

27:11.997 --> 27:14.165
- Yeah.
- - Shit.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.272
- Aw, that's just sad.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.909
The stuff coming out of it.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.616
Look, Rachel found something!

27:37.989 --> 27:39.924
- Is that a shoe?

27:40.759 --> 27:42.594
Is that a baby's shoe?

27:45.330 --> 27:46.431
- Fuck.

28:01.713 --> 28:02.981
- Rachel?

28:04.816 --> 28:05.816
Rachel?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.954
Rachel, you okay?

28:11.156 --> 28:12.156
You okay?

28:12.590 --> 28:13.590
- Yeah, sure.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.162
- Come on, let's go.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.421
Guys, guys wait up!

28:44.289 --> 28:45.522
- Are you okay?

28:45.523 --> 28:47.792
- No, I feel strange.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.395
A little dizzy. Fuck.

28:51.596 --> 28:52.863
- Can we stop for a second?

28:52.864 --> 28:54.098
- Yeah, yeah,
can we have a break?

28:54.099 --> 28:56.201
- He's not okay.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.002
He's feeling a little dizzy.

28:58.002 --> 28:58.837
- You okay there buddy?

28:58.838 --> 29:00.003
- Not really.

29:00.004 --> 29:01.238
Fuck.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.307
- Normal.
- It's normal?

29:03.308 --> 29:06.911
Well I heard some locals
talking about gold

29:07.779 --> 29:09.848
or copper mining around here.

29:11.282 --> 29:14.452
Could this sickness be the
result of copper poisoning?

29:15.587 --> 29:16.753
- Shit, what,
I'm being poisoned now?

29:16.754 --> 29:17.955
Jesus!

29:17.956 --> 29:19.456
- Shit dude, stay
away, you're poisoned!

29:19.457 --> 29:23.628
- Fuck you, Thomas.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.698
- What?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.667
Are you mocking me?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.339
- Actually, I think...

29:35.507 --> 29:36.707
I think you've had too
many dinners last night

29:36.708 --> 29:39.009
and way too many beers.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.746
- Yeah, look who's talking.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.681
- Shit, I'm fine.

29:46.684 --> 29:47.785
- What?

29:54.559 --> 29:56.728
- Sometimes in the forest,

29:59.297 --> 30:00.632
you hear things.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.477
- Fuck.

30:17.749 --> 30:18.749
Just...

30:26.357 --> 30:27.692
Wait, wait wait.

30:30.862 --> 30:33.198
- What is he doing?

30:38.369 --> 30:41.539
- Jesus!
- Can you hear?

30:43.675 --> 30:46.177
- I think it's Romanian.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.880
I'll get my headphones.

30:50.348 --> 30:54.018
- If it's Romanian,
maybe we can translate it?

31:07.265 --> 31:08.633
- What the?

31:18.977 --> 31:20.645
Wait wait, shh, shh!

31:22.080 --> 31:23.648
Jesus, here listen!

31:30.688 --> 31:32.423
- Oh my God.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.629
- Wait wait wait.

31:38.363 --> 31:39.363
- What the?

31:40.198 --> 31:42.333
- Wait, wait, he's coming up.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.505
Something wrong?

31:48.606 --> 31:49.941
- Okay.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.909
- Should I ask
him about the girl?

31:52.910 --> 31:55.079
- Shut up, shh, shh!

31:58.750 --> 32:01.185
- Are you okay to go?

32:07.792 --> 32:08.893
- What?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.730
- Hey, hey hey!

32:13.731 --> 32:15.332
- Mr. Dogaru!
- - That's an owl.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.533
- Mister...

32:16.534 --> 32:17.768
- Go!
- - What?

32:17.769 --> 32:18.937
Mister Dogaru!

32:19.871 --> 32:20.971
What the Hell?

32:20.972 --> 32:22.439
- Hey, come back!

32:22.440 --> 32:25.142
- What, because
of that stupid fucking owl?

32:25.143 --> 32:27.044
- Mr. Dogaru!
- - Hey!

32:27.045 --> 32:28.880
- Mr. Dogaru!

32:29.981 --> 32:31.148
- Ah screw that, I'm going back!

32:31.149 --> 32:32.549
- Fuck!
- - No no no.

32:32.550 --> 32:33.784
- No, I'm going back, fuck this!

32:33.785 --> 32:35.152
Oh my God!

32:35.153 --> 32:36.387
- Rachel!

32:37.555 --> 32:39.289
- Stop, stop, stop!
- - Why?

32:39.290 --> 32:40.124
- Fuck.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.291
- Let's go back!

32:41.292 --> 32:42.226
- Go where?

32:42.227 --> 32:43.960
- I don't know, back!

32:43.961 --> 32:45.662
- Do you know
tracks, do you know anything?

32:45.663 --> 32:46.863
Do you have a map?

32:46.864 --> 32:48.765
- No you don't!
- - Holy shit.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.801
- Shit, dude, he
just fucking disappeared!

32:50.802 --> 32:52.403
- Mr. Dogaru!

32:53.037 --> 32:54.037
Come back!

32:55.473 --> 32:56.473
Mother!

33:46.691 --> 33:48.259
- That fucking guy.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.730
- That guy
really fucked us here!

33:55.066 --> 33:58.169
- How the hell do
we get out of here?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.271
How the hell do we
get out of here?

34:01.272 --> 34:02.739
- Let me think!

34:02.740 --> 34:04.775
- Think about what,
Christmas shopping?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.209
- Tom, let her think!

34:06.210 --> 34:07.744
- No no no, we need to move!

34:07.745 --> 34:08.978
We need to move now!

34:08.980 --> 34:10.580
- What good will that do?

34:10.581 --> 34:11.748
We don't even know which way!

34:11.748 --> 34:13.083
- Guys, shut up!

34:36.774 --> 34:39.010
- My leg is so itchy!

34:40.344 --> 34:41.610
- What's wrong with it?
- - I don't know!

34:41.612 --> 34:42.780
Let me just...

34:44.348 --> 34:47.685
- Jesus Christ!
- - Woah, shit!

34:48.853 --> 34:49.520
- Did you have
that this morning?

34:49.521 --> 34:50.786
- Ah!

34:50.788 --> 34:53.024
Well, you think I
would've noticed!

34:53.958 --> 34:54.958
Ah!

34:55.693 --> 34:58.196
- Like the girl said.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.866
It's the sickness, the rash.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.943
- It's just a rash.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.480
- This forest is so damn big.

35:16.347 --> 35:17.447
And we're lost in it, what the?

35:17.448 --> 35:18.849
Can you stand on your leg?

35:18.850 --> 35:21.252
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.922
- Okay.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.791
Let's just keep moving.

36:02.593 --> 36:04.829
Maybe we'll find a way out.

36:08.132 --> 36:12.303
- Look, we've been
walking for over an hour now.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.571
And we haven't found shit!

36:14.572 --> 36:16.473
I mean, what the fuck
happened to Mr. Dogaru anyway?

36:16.474 --> 36:18.476
- I don't know.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.614
I mean, this forest is
so deep, and so dense...

36:32.523 --> 36:34.425
- And you know...

36:35.793 --> 36:37.727
You know we could be walking
in circles, right now?

36:37.728 --> 36:39.229
- Yeah, you're right.

36:39.230 --> 36:42.967
- Yeah, you think
I'm stupid or something?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.037
- Dude, look.
- - Yeah.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.513
How long have we
been following these?

36:56.514 --> 36:58.281
- I don't know, maybe a while.

36:58.282 --> 37:01.318
- They look like
a child's footprints.

37:01.319 --> 37:04.754
- Shit, Jesus
Christ, it's gotta be true.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.890
- Fuck.
- Okay.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.060
These must lead somewhere.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.798
Come on, Joe, please.

37:15.866 --> 37:16.866
Oh, my God.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.808
- I think there's someone...
- - Yeah.

37:24.809 --> 37:25.910
What is that?

37:34.018 --> 37:35.519
Come on, let's go.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.361
Rachel, careful!

37:50.735 --> 37:52.536
What the fuck is going on?

37:53.404 --> 37:55.239
- What happened to him?

37:56.173 --> 37:57.341
- Jesus.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.146
- Tom, what happened to him?

38:03.147 --> 38:06.216
- He's fucking dead,
that's what happened to him!

38:06.217 --> 38:07.952
- Oh my God.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.934
- Where you going?
- I have no idea.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.037
- Shit.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.907
- Maybe he's
got a map or something?

38:30.841 --> 38:31.841
Tom?

38:32.543 --> 38:33.344
- What, don't look at me!

38:33.345 --> 38:34.945
I'm doing shit, you go!

38:35.680 --> 38:36.414
I'm not touching him.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.682
- Joe?

38:38.549 --> 38:40.950
- I'm not fucking touching him.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.485
- All right.
- - Give me the camera.

38:42.486 --> 38:46.557
- I'll do it.
- - Give me the camera.

38:47.024 --> 38:48.024
Okay.

38:51.696 --> 38:52.763
- Fuck!

39:25.896 --> 39:27.231
- Nothing.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.701
There was nothing.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.302
Here, give me.

39:33.571 --> 39:36.606
- Hold the camera.
- - Yeah.

39:36.607 --> 39:37.607
God.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.046
There's nothing on him.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.514
- Okay.
- Fuck.

39:44.515 --> 39:45.715
- Now what?

39:45.716 --> 39:47.283
- I don't know.

39:47.284 --> 39:48.785
- Look, let's just go.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.187
Let's just go, there's
nothing we can do.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.889
- Did you pay Mr.
Dogaru in advance?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.023
- No.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.225
He refused.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.727
- Oh, and you think
that wasn't weird, huh?

39:57.728 --> 40:00.831
- I don't know,
you're the smart one.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.435
Jesus, I'm freezing.

40:07.772 --> 40:09.606
- Let's just move, okay?

40:09.607 --> 40:11.875
- Okay.
- - Let's just go.

40:11.876 --> 40:12.876
- Fuck.

41:08.532 --> 41:11.101
- Jesus, I'm freezing.

41:12.036 --> 41:14.538
- Freezing and starving.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.006
- Don't you have
any food in your bag?

41:17.007 --> 41:18.141
- If I had any
food left in my bag,

41:18.142 --> 41:20.845
- I would be eating it.
- - Fuck.

41:37.228 --> 41:41.065
Fuck, jeez!

41:45.469 --> 41:48.404
- How the fuck
do we get out of here?

41:48.405 --> 41:49.473
Jesus Christ!

41:56.247 --> 41:58.916
- Shh, do you hear that?

42:05.990 --> 42:07.757
- Fuck, fuck!
- - Shit, ah!

42:07.758 --> 42:10.493
- Tom, stop it!
- Ow, my leg!

42:10.494 --> 42:13.129
- Tom, stop it!
- Why?

42:13.130 --> 42:16.199
You don't want me drawing
any attention to us?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.434
Well fuck that!

42:18.302 --> 42:20.771
Give me some fucking attention!

42:21.639 --> 42:22.406
- Tom, the footprints.

42:22.407 --> 42:23.640
- Hello?

42:23.641 --> 42:24.441
- They just disappeared.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.210
- Can anybody hear me?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.546
- Guys!
- - Fuck!

43:20.030 --> 43:23.300
You guys, there's
some signs over here.

43:23.901 --> 43:24.901
- Shit!

43:25.469 --> 43:26.469
What now?

43:28.806 --> 43:30.406
- It's in Romanian.

43:30.407 --> 43:31.742
- Aw shit.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.646
Rachel, Rachel,
can you translate?

43:42.386 --> 43:45.455
- It says something about...

43:45.456 --> 43:46.456
Oh no.

43:47.157 --> 43:49.058
Something you have to pay for.

43:49.059 --> 43:50.160
- Fuck!

43:51.362 --> 43:53.464
- You have to pay
for what you did.

43:55.399 --> 43:56.432
This is so scary.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.034
- So it's a warning?

43:58.035 --> 44:01.305
- What?
- What's that Tom?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.540
- Oh my God!
- - It says Diary.

44:04.541 --> 44:06.109
- Okay, give it to me.

44:06.110 --> 44:07.210
- What?
- - Give it to me!

44:07.211 --> 44:08.811
- Why?
- - It's mine!

44:08.812 --> 44:10.613
- What?
- - Give it to me!

44:10.614 --> 44:11.582
That's mine.

44:11.583 --> 44:13.449
Turn off the camera. Right now.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.219
- Hey, hey hey!

44:21.158 --> 44:22.158
Tom.

44:26.597 --> 44:27.597
Tom.

44:38.242 --> 44:40.576
I think she knows
something, man.

44:40.577 --> 44:43.814
Something she's not
fucking telling us.

45:38.168 --> 45:40.003
- Um, guys?
- - Yeah?

45:42.206 --> 45:45.142
Guys, there's
something over there!

45:45.876 --> 45:47.077
- Over where?

45:47.811 --> 45:49.313
- Over there.

45:49.913 --> 45:50.913
By that tree!

46:14.338 --> 46:15.338
What the?

46:23.180 --> 46:24.248
What is that?

46:28.085 --> 46:29.319
- Hearts.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.623
That's giving me the
creeps, let's go.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.626
- Come on, we should
move, come on Rachel.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.961
Rachel, come on.

46:40.330 --> 46:43.667
- Come on.
- Rachel, come on.

46:59.283 --> 47:00.283
Tom.

47:01.218 --> 47:03.186
Tom, we need to talk, man.

47:03.187 --> 47:04.187
- What?

47:07.124 --> 47:09.258
- That journal just made...

47:09.259 --> 47:10.560
Made Rachel nervous.

47:10.561 --> 47:12.729
Okay, she knows something.

47:15.299 --> 47:17.467
- I have the same feeling.

47:32.316 --> 47:33.650
- Guys?

47:37.821 --> 47:40.891
What exactly are
you keeping from me?

47:44.394 --> 47:45.829
What do you know?

47:48.632 --> 47:50.133
- What do we know?

47:53.036 --> 47:54.371
What do we know?

47:56.540 --> 47:57.975
What do you know?

48:02.379 --> 48:04.046
You're the one who
acted strangely

48:04.047 --> 48:06.283
when we found that journal!

48:10.287 --> 48:12.521
For fuck's sake,
you know something!

48:12.522 --> 48:14.790
- Tom, stop.
- - Why should I?

48:14.791 --> 48:16.793
- Look, stop okay?

48:18.295 --> 48:19.295
We...

48:21.932 --> 48:23.333
We did something.

48:52.829 --> 48:54.932
- Have you seen my pills?

48:56.166 --> 48:58.068
- No.
- - Tom, my pills?

48:58.935 --> 49:00.771
- I haven't seen your pills.

49:03.740 --> 49:05.374
- Joe?
- No.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.243
Tom, have you got them?
- No!

49:07.244 --> 49:08.244
What pills?

49:09.479 --> 49:12.816
- Tom, I need my pills, please.

49:13.417 --> 49:14.417
- Why?

49:15.319 --> 49:18.455
- What are they for?
- - I just need them!

49:19.056 --> 49:20.056
- Why?

49:21.291 --> 49:23.794
- It's for my nerves!

49:24.995 --> 49:26.195
Okay?

49:26.196 --> 49:27.596
I get a little
anxious sometimes.

49:27.597 --> 49:28.965
- Oh, you get a little anxious!

49:28.966 --> 49:30.467
- Yes, for example, right now!

49:31.401 --> 49:32.868
Give me my fucking pills!

49:32.869 --> 49:35.271
- Well look who had
some skeletons in her closet!

49:35.272 --> 49:37.740
- Oh, thank you very much, yeah.

49:37.741 --> 49:39.141
Give me my pills.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.810
- I don't have your goddamn
pills, now piss off!

49:40.811 --> 49:43.412
- You do!
- - Hey, guys!

49:43.413 --> 49:45.214
Guy, guys!
- You wanna fight?

49:45.215 --> 49:47.216
- Hey, hey, hey, Tom!

49:47.217 --> 49:49.819
Fucking stop!

49:49.820 --> 49:50.821
Jesus, stop!

49:51.955 --> 49:54.190
- Fuck you!
- - Fuck me?

49:54.191 --> 49:55.725
- Fuck you!
- - Tom!

49:55.726 --> 49:57.327
Jesus Christ, fuck!

50:45.242 --> 50:48.578
- I think we should
head that direction.

50:49.212 --> 50:50.212
Definitely.

50:51.348 --> 50:54.518
- Okay, I think we
should go that way.

50:55.652 --> 50:56.486
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

50:56.487 --> 50:57.487
I just said that way!

50:57.488 --> 50:59.188
- No, I think that way.

50:59.189 --> 51:00.189
- What the?

51:00.991 --> 51:02.726
Joe, say something, please.

51:13.937 --> 51:15.471
- Oh my God!

51:15.472 --> 51:16.739
- What?

51:16.740 --> 51:17.840
- Fuck!

51:17.841 --> 51:20.343
- Mr. Dogaru!
- - Oh my God!

51:25.615 --> 51:27.684
- Who's doing this?

51:29.953 --> 51:32.622
Shh!

51:34.324 --> 51:35.725
Can you hear her?

51:37.060 --> 51:38.928
Make her stop, shut up!

51:38.929 --> 51:40.529
- Tom, who?
- - Tom, Tom, Tom!

51:40.530 --> 51:43.132
Stop, stop!

51:43.133 --> 51:44.134
- Tom!

51:46.570 --> 51:47.838
- Tom?

51:49.639 --> 51:50.639
- Tom!

51:55.378 --> 51:56.378
Fuck, Tom?

51:57.914 --> 51:58.948
- We need to wake him up.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.684
- Yeah, I know.

52:01.418 --> 52:02.619
- We have to go. Tom?

52:03.487 --> 52:05.087
- Tom.
- Tom.

52:05.088 --> 52:07.190
Wake up. Can you hear me?

52:07.791 --> 52:08.791
Tom!

52:09.693 --> 52:11.427
Fuck, I need my pills!

52:11.428 --> 52:13.462
- Rachel,
Rachel, wait wait wait.

52:13.463 --> 52:14.463
Rachel.

52:15.465 --> 52:16.465
Rachel.

52:19.736 --> 52:21.071
- We have to go.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.772
- Yeah, I know.

52:22.773 --> 52:23.939
- Come on, Tom!

52:23.940 --> 52:25.341
- Wait, stop that!
- Tom!

52:25.342 --> 52:26.575
Tom, can you hear me?

52:26.576 --> 52:27.477
- Wake up!
- - Rachel, stop that!

52:27.478 --> 52:28.677
Stop!
- What?

52:28.678 --> 52:29.945
- He's probably
got a concussion.

52:29.946 --> 52:32.281
- We don't have time!
- - Yeah, I know!

52:32.282 --> 52:33.282
- Tom. Tom.

52:34.584 --> 52:35.851
- Rachel, stop!
- - Wake the fuck up!

52:35.852 --> 52:37.020
We have to go!

52:38.488 --> 52:39.989
- Hey, look, look, look.

52:39.990 --> 52:43.426
Look, he's coming
back, he's coming back.

52:44.561 --> 52:46.396
- Tom.
- - Hey, Tommy.

52:48.532 --> 52:51.434
- Hey buddy.
- - We have to go.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.203
- You okay?
- - Fast.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.873
- It's Joe.
- - Oh hey.

52:58.108 --> 52:59.575
- Where am I?
- - You bumped your head.

52:59.576 --> 53:01.010
- What?
- - What?

53:01.011 --> 53:03.746
- Where am I?
- - Oh my God!

53:03.747 --> 53:04.747
Okay.

53:11.221 --> 53:13.056
- Hey. You okay?

53:24.334 --> 53:25.402
What's wrong?

53:36.713 --> 53:38.048
- I'm sorry Joe.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.849
- For what?
- - I'm really sorry.

53:40.850 --> 53:42.285
- For what?

53:45.388 --> 53:46.388
For her.

53:46.990 --> 53:48.325
- Ah shit.

53:50.193 --> 53:51.695
- The little girl.

53:52.295 --> 53:53.396
- Fuck.

53:54.664 --> 53:56.399
Come on, come on man.

53:57.300 --> 53:58.834
Can you stand, we need to go.

53:58.835 --> 54:00.170
Come on, get up.

54:00.904 --> 54:01.838
Here, here, come on.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.406
I'll help you up, come on.

54:04.574 --> 54:07.010
Give me your hand, that's it.

54:07.744 --> 54:08.744
Here we go, yeah.

54:11.514 --> 54:12.682
Hey, you okay?

54:13.550 --> 54:16.219
Let me just brush that shit off.

54:16.686 --> 54:17.686
Fuck.

54:32.702 --> 54:35.104
What the fuck?

54:35.105 --> 54:36.805
Jesus!

54:36.806 --> 54:39.174
- Oh my God!
- - Rachel!

54:39.175 --> 54:40.175
Rachel!

54:40.477 --> 54:41.477
Fuck!

54:41.578 --> 54:42.578
Rachel!

54:46.449 --> 54:47.449
Rachel!

54:52.255 --> 54:54.257
Rachel, get up, come on!

54:54.991 --> 54:56.426
Come on Rachel, get up!

54:58.995 --> 54:59.995
Fuck!

55:01.498 --> 55:02.498
Fuck!

55:04.334 --> 55:05.334
Fuck.

55:06.236 --> 55:07.904
Guys, guys, hold on.

55:25.355 --> 55:27.190
- Stop, stop.

55:31.761 --> 55:34.229
- No, no, no, we
have to keep moving!

55:34.230 --> 55:36.799
- I think we should
stay here for the night.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.201
- Tom, Tom!

55:38.802 --> 55:39.802
Rachel's right.

55:40.336 --> 55:42.572
Rachel's right, it's gonna...

55:43.440 --> 55:44.673
Fuck, it's gonna get dark soon.

55:44.674 --> 55:46.008
- We won't be able
to see anything.

55:46.009 --> 55:47.476
- We have the light
from the camera.

55:47.477 --> 55:49.044
- Turn it off.
- - It just won't help.

55:49.045 --> 55:50.312
It just won't help us.

55:50.313 --> 55:52.114
Besides, Rachel's
in very much pain.

55:52.115 --> 55:53.482
So we'll just have to stop here.

55:53.483 --> 55:55.484
Look, look, you guys stay here.

55:55.485 --> 55:57.419
I'll just go check
out the tent, okay?

55:57.420 --> 55:58.487
- Okay, okay.

55:58.488 --> 55:59.723
I'll wait here.

56:14.771 --> 56:17.740
- Hey, hey, what are
you guys whispering about?

56:17.741 --> 56:20.743
- Nothing Joe, it's not
personal, believe me.

56:20.744 --> 56:22.277
- Hatching plans behind my back,

56:22.278 --> 56:23.879
I'd say that's pretty
fucking personal, Tom!

56:23.880 --> 56:25.114
- We're not hatching
plans behind your back!

56:25.115 --> 56:26.281
- What's wrong with you?
- - Joe, please.

56:26.282 --> 56:27.516
Listen to me.

56:27.517 --> 56:29.017
Please, I'm really
fucking scared!

56:29.018 --> 56:30.619
We have to keep moving, it's...

56:30.620 --> 56:32.287
- Joe, give me the blanket.

56:32.288 --> 56:35.458
- Yeah, the blanket, shit, here.

56:36.192 --> 56:37.794
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom!

56:41.498 --> 56:42.865
It was in the blanket.

56:42.866 --> 56:44.267
Fuck, is it full?

56:52.142 --> 56:53.142
Is it full?

56:53.643 --> 56:54.643
- Yeah!

56:55.478 --> 56:56.678
- Okay, we have whiskey.

56:56.679 --> 56:59.883
Tom, go find some wood!
- Yeah. Here.

57:01.317 --> 57:04.453
- Rachel, you okay?
- - Keep an eye out!

57:04.454 --> 57:05.954
- Is that still rolling?

57:05.955 --> 57:07.791
- Oh shit, yeah.

57:14.197 --> 57:17.033
- I think my girlfriend's
having a shit fit.

57:18.501 --> 57:22.505
She probably thinks I'm
pissing away the rent money.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.974
- You think she'll notice?

57:25.975 --> 57:28.144
I mean, if you're missing?

57:28.878 --> 57:30.180
- Well, I hope so.

57:31.447 --> 57:34.050
I mean, she loves me, you know?

57:37.353 --> 57:38.621
- Rachel?

57:39.789 --> 57:43.526
You got anyone who might
notice you're missing?

57:45.061 --> 57:49.232
- Hey, you got any more
of that nasty alcohol left?

58:16.059 --> 58:19.729
- I think she
feels safer in the tent.

58:22.031 --> 58:23.031
- Yeah.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.736
I wouldn't feel safe here
even if I had an AK-47.

58:30.273 --> 58:31.341
- Yeah.

58:32.208 --> 58:33.743
We should just go inside.

58:37.213 --> 58:38.213
- Yeah.

58:54.297 --> 58:55.297
When...

58:57.300 --> 58:58.902
When I was a child.

59:00.803 --> 59:02.372
All I wanted was...

59:04.173 --> 59:05.241
To grow up...

59:07.677 --> 59:09.245
And become someone.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.315
You know, someone good.

59:13.583 --> 59:15.018
With a good soul.

59:20.356 --> 59:23.026
This could be my last day alive.

59:26.329 --> 59:29.832
I'm drinking and I'm
thinking to myself...

59:34.671 --> 59:36.638
Is it good, what I'm doing?

59:36.639 --> 59:37.639
I mean...

59:39.776 --> 59:41.444
What could I do now?

59:44.514 --> 59:45.581
I don't know.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.854
Elizabeth, if...

59:54.023 --> 59:55.758
Someday you see this.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:06.269
I want you to know that I
really, really love you,

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.071
and I'm sorry if I
acted like a prick

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.539
and like a jerk.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.043
And if I wasn't there
when I was supposed to...

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.512
Supported you.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.782
Just to be there.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:23.486
I'm sorry I couldn't do that.

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:26.621
I love you.

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.862
I love you.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.068
- Tom?
- - Yeah?

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.871
- We should...

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:45.074
We should try to get some sleep.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:46.842
- Yeah, we should.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.348
I love you, be good Elizabeth.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.117
- Tom.
- Yeah?

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:55.985
- Go to sleep.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.398
- Rachel!

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.233
Rachel.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.173
Tom!

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.709
Tom, wake up!

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.176
Tom!

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:22.844
Fuck!

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:26.648
Rachel!

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.255
Rachel!
- What?

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:38.194
- You nearly
gave me a heart attack!

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.495
Why didn't you wake me up?

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:42.798
- Excuse me,
can I have some privacy?

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.368
- Oh, okay, sorry, sorry.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.381
- Why didn't we bring torches?

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.652
- Yeah, why
didn't we bring a map?

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.861
I'd rather pee my pants
than go out there.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.431
- Well, I'm not like you, guys.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.479
- So...

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:36.018
Why is the forest punishing you?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.300
- I...

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:16.025
- We were at this party...

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.962
We had so much to drink.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.468
Tom insisted on driving.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:29.971
And...

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:32.542
Out of nowhere,

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:37.313
this little girl just
jumped in front of the car.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.250
And went straight under it.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:50.126
Tom didn't stop,
we just kept going.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.698
Who knows what she was doing

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.768
on the streets
that time of night.

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:04.806
Then we...

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.542
We just dumped the car.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.545
And moved to the states.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.250
I just...

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:19.288
I shouldn't have helped him.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.892
I shouldn't have
helped him cover it up.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:24.893
I just...

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.432
Fuck.

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:37.874
- I think...

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:43.379
We all did things we
shouldn't have done.

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.856
I was in college.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.632
My first year.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.476
I had a daughter.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.654
I was studying
for my first exam.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:32.328
A friend of mine asked me
to take care of his dog.

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.973
I was studying in my room.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.911
And I heard a noise.

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.584
I heard a girl screaming.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.285
My girl.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:05:59.587
And...

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.926
As I went down the stairs...

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:07.897
I saw the dog.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.437
Biting her throat.

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:22.110
I tried to do
everything I could.

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:25.514
I tried to get the
dog off of her, but...

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.115
I just couldn't.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.352
It was, it was too late.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.362
I just stood there and watched

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:43.932
my girl.

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.036
Dying.

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.016
You know.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.888
She used to draw
little drawings.

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.489
In my journal.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.727
- Jesus.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:46.428
Tom, Tom!

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.665
- Tom wake up!
- - What?

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:51.833
- What?
- - Tom, it's Rachel!

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.936
It's Rachel, it's Rachel.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.838
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.440
I don't know what's
wrong with her.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.876
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:02.911
- What's wrong with her?

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.313
- I don't know.
- - Rachel!

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.314
Hey!

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.149
Rachel!

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.252
Hey!

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.490
What's wrong with you?

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.792
Rachel.

01:08:22.163 --> 01:08:24.166
- Rachel, get out!

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.035
Oh fuck, oh fuck!

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.042
Fucking get out, Rachel, go!

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.212
Go Rachel, go!

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.081
- Fuck!
- - Leave me alone!

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.850
- Wait, Rachel!

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:43.853
- Where's Tom?
- - I don't know!
