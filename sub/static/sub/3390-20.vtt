WEBVTT

00:55.366 --> 00:59.500
After hearing San Baek and Sa-woo
had escaped while being transported,

00:59.666 --> 01:01.166
Hyun-jun returns to the NSS.

01:01.933 --> 01:04.166
Director Baek and Sa-woo Jin escaped
during their escort!

01:05.700 --> 01:06.933
Chul-young and Sun-hwa

01:07.066 --> 01:09.066
come to South Korea
after finding an evidence

01:09.400 --> 01:10.600
of another possible conspiracy.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.166
I will go to South Korea with you.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.366
Meanwhile,

01:17.700 --> 01:20.966
Hyung-jun Jung gets assassinated by Vick,

01:21.666 --> 01:23.533
and Hyun-jun tracks him down,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.766
but does not find anything about Iris.

01:28.466 --> 01:29.966
Where are San Baek and Sa-woo Jin?

01:32.800 --> 01:33.700
Hyun-jun!

01:35.300 --> 01:36.333
The NSS

01:36.700 --> 01:39.433
takes San Baek into custody
at the base of Iris,

01:39.866 --> 01:42.100
but Sa-woo and other Iris mercenaries

01:42.400 --> 01:44.600
create a massive hostage situation.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.133
A hostage situation?

01:58.233 --> 01:59.733
FINAL EPISODE

02:35.600 --> 02:37.500
-What is it?
-The entry team tried to enter

02:37.566 --> 02:38.666
and activated the booby trap.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.900
Check on the booby traps at each entrance

02:41.033 --> 02:42.066
and tighten the security.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.133
Yes, sir.

02:50.533 --> 02:51.466
What happened?

02:51.533 --> 02:52.633
We tried to enter,

02:52.766 --> 02:54.000
but got caught by a booby trap.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.266
We don't even know
how many hostage takers are in there.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.833
How could you try to infiltrate already?

02:58.633 --> 03:01.000
Anti-terrorism mission depends strongly
on the initial operation.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.400
Don't you know that we will be
at a greater disadvantage

03:03.800 --> 03:05.633
if we give them more time to get prepared?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.433
If we can't be sure
of the hostages' safety,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.666
do not attempt any infiltration,
in any given situation.

03:09.966 --> 03:11.533
What are you to give orders?

03:12.933 --> 03:14.566
-Do you want to die?
-Go ahead. Shoot.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.266
What?

03:24.000 --> 03:24.966
All right.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.233
The entry team tried to infiltrate

03:29.833 --> 03:30.800
and failed.

03:31.633 --> 03:32.566
Any casualties?

03:32.966 --> 03:34.366
A booby trap went off

03:34.633 --> 03:35.900
taking three lives.

03:37.033 --> 03:39.666
I'd like to be reported directly
from the scene.

03:40.466 --> 03:41.866
Prepare the telepresence system.

03:42.733 --> 03:43.666
Yes, sir.

03:50.133 --> 03:52.200
Yes. All right.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.066
Yes, this is Hyun-jun Kim.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.066
From this point on,

04:02.200 --> 04:03.800
the NSS is in charge
of the field operation.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.233
Yes, sir.

04:11.566 --> 04:13.300
The NSS will be in charge from now on.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.866
Infiltration will be postponed until
we figure out what's going on inside.

04:17.066 --> 04:18.600
You want us to just wait?

04:18.666 --> 04:20.066
According to what the NSS found out,

04:20.600 --> 04:23.566
it is presumed that the hostage takers
have biochemical weapons.

04:23.866 --> 04:24.766
Forced infiltration

04:24.900 --> 04:26.700
can lead to the death of all hostages.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.200
I hear it is a hostage situation.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.466
Where is the location?

04:35.533 --> 04:36.533
Forget about the field work.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.766
You return to the headquarters.

04:37.833 --> 04:38.900
Who's in charge of the field?

04:39.133 --> 04:40.100
TK1.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.433
I'll go to the field.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.566
Tell me the location.

04:42.633 --> 04:43.533
No!

04:43.600 --> 04:46.566
Even if you don't tell me,
I can figure out the location anyways.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.166
Please give me approval.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.433
I'll be going to the field.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.633
I got in.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.133
Any other cameras?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
No, just this one.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.433
The only one left

05:09.833 --> 05:11.633
is showing a clear view of the hostage.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.166
Seems like the terrorists

05:13.400 --> 05:14.633
are showing it to us on purpose.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.933
Send this clip to the NSS

05:16.366 --> 05:18.433
-so they can see it as well.
-Yes, sir.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.500
It's me.

05:19.566 --> 05:21.833
We got hold of the video surveillance
within the shopping mall.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.733
I'll connect it
so you can see it there as well.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.366
It's a video surveillance view
within the shopping mall.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.066
There seems to be at least 100 hostages,

05:29.433 --> 05:31.266
and the terrorists are armed
with automatic rifles.

05:31.566 --> 05:33.900
The gas masks they have with them...

05:34.200 --> 05:36.000
They are specially made
for biochemical usage.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.066
It's a model much better than normal gas
masks in chemical gas particle filtering.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.000
They must be trying to use
biochemical weapons.

05:46.366 --> 05:48.333
DIRECTOR KANG-OH YOO

05:50.966 --> 05:52.033
Chul-young Park speaking.

05:52.733 --> 05:53.633
Yes.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.700
Yes.

05:56.766 --> 05:58.533
I'll discuss it
with the North Korean government.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.066
What's the matter?

06:08.633 --> 06:10.800
There is a hostage situation in downtown.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.733
They took over an entire shopping mall.

06:14.366 --> 06:15.400
Who are they?

06:16.400 --> 06:19.100
The identity and their demands
are not clear yet,

06:19.633 --> 06:22.466
but it is expected to be related
to the summit discussion.

06:24.266 --> 06:25.600
I think it's Iris.

06:26.466 --> 06:27.400
Then

06:27.866 --> 06:29.733
will there be changes to the VIP schedule?

06:29.866 --> 06:30.933
No, not yet.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.500
Nothing is clear yet.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.066
Joong-kwon, you review the VIP schedule.

06:36.533 --> 06:37.466
Yes, sir.

06:37.666 --> 06:40.666
And Sun-hwa, you check
how the hostage situation develops.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.166
Yes, sir.

07:00.766 --> 07:01.700
Why are you here?

07:02.833 --> 07:04.933
I got orders from Secretary Park
to assist you.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.033
Tae-sung is enough for assistance.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.466
-Go back to the headquarters.
-I'd rather stay here than to wait there.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.100
Don't worry about me.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.166
Tell them what we want

07:22.700 --> 07:23.733
as we prepared.

07:43.633 --> 07:44.600
We are ready.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.366
Come see this!

07:51.700 --> 07:53.433
It's a video clip that we just received.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.900
I think they are sending it to us
on purpose.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.333
Send it to the NSS as well.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.466
Already doing that.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.033
Currently,

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
we have 107 hostages in our hands.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.966
All the entrances to the shopping mall

08:09.600 --> 08:10.900
have been cut off.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.766
Bombs with soman gas have been set

08:14.633 --> 08:17.233
on every entrance as well as

08:17.833 --> 08:19.566
this room with the hostages.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.333
We believe that

08:23.066 --> 08:24.333
President Myung-ho Cho

08:24.566 --> 08:27.600
is announcing the summit discussion
agreement tomorrow at 7 p.m.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.766
Our demand is that

08:30.466 --> 08:31.666
President Myung-ho Cho

08:32.966 --> 08:35.933
announces cancellation
of the summit discussion.

08:37.133 --> 08:39.433
Also, we demand that he announces

08:40.566 --> 08:41.933
cancellations of economic cooperation,

08:42.033 --> 08:43.533
as well as the North-South talks,

08:44.233 --> 08:45.766
and cutting off the North-South hotline.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.066
If he does not announce

08:50.866 --> 08:54.066
the cancellations as we ask
by 7 p.m. tomorrow,

08:55.500 --> 08:57.133
not only the 107 hostages here,

08:58.033 --> 09:02.333
but also thousands of civilians near the
mall will be sacrificed by the soman gas.

09:17.466 --> 09:18.500
This is

09:21.166 --> 09:22.500
the punishment

09:22.566 --> 09:23.733
of your infiltration operation.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.500
What are you doing?

09:56.666 --> 09:58.366
By whose orders did you kill the hostage?

09:58.933 --> 10:00.566
Because you are from the NSS,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.966
you are not aware of the criminal's side
of a hostage situation, I guess.

10:04.066 --> 10:06.400
Terrorism is to literally
give them terror.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.600
The key to success in

10:08.900 --> 10:10.666
getting what we demand

10:10.866 --> 10:12.166
is to create fear.

10:12.466 --> 10:14.233
Unnecessary sacrifice is not my objective!

10:14.400 --> 10:15.333
This is the way

10:15.766 --> 10:17.266
these guys and I do it.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.133
According to your theory,

10:43.800 --> 10:45.100
if I kill you,

10:46.033 --> 10:47.700
the fear they have towards me

10:49.300 --> 10:50.300
will increase.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.466
It's a final warning.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.100
If you disobey my orders again,

10:58.666 --> 10:59.600
then

11:01.233 --> 11:02.300
it'll be the end of you.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.700
So

11:06.833 --> 11:08.633
it was the deed of Iris?

11:09.033 --> 11:09.966
In addition,

11:10.033 --> 11:11.533
they want us to disconnect

11:11.933 --> 11:13.266
all communications and relationship

11:13.766 --> 11:16.033
and make an announcement about it.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.233
What if we refuse?

11:18.566 --> 11:19.833
If we do not announce it by then,

11:20.733 --> 11:22.166
they'll detonate the biochemical bombs

11:22.633 --> 11:24.266
they set with the hostages.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.100
What is that soman gas?

11:26.400 --> 11:29.733
There are three types in the G-series gas,
sarin, tabun and soman.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.500
It is the deadliest nerve agent gas.

11:34.066 --> 11:36.166
It will harm the 107 hostages for sure

11:36.600 --> 11:38.700
and if the gas leaks out of the building,

11:39.533 --> 11:40.900
it will cause damage to everyone

11:41.333 --> 11:43.133
within a kilometer radius.

12:25.966 --> 12:27.066
Our Director

12:27.533 --> 12:29.466
will arrive tomorrow as scheduled.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.233
We must handle the situation

12:31.666 --> 12:33.533
before the joint press conference
takes place.

12:33.766 --> 12:36.666
A lot of hostages' lives are at stake.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.366
I do not believe it will end that easily.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.433
If you can't sort out the situation
before the conference,

12:43.633 --> 12:45.500
we must call off all our schedule.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.666
We would like to see the situation
on the field.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.266
Please send in our agents as well.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.500
Someone from
the North Korean side has come.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.600
The director approved.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.766
Even the NSS's situation room

13:22.866 --> 13:25.033
failed to get into the security system
of the shopping mall

13:25.300 --> 13:28.433
Also, the structure of the building makes
it impossible to send in any helicams.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.533
If we are willing to sacrifice
some hostages' lives,

13:30.633 --> 13:32.166
we can neutralize the booby trap

13:32.466 --> 13:33.533
and infiltrate.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.733
No, there is soman gas.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.766
Although they said it is located
with the hostages,

13:36.866 --> 13:38.466
due to its lack of sustainability,

13:38.766 --> 13:41.066
they could have set it
in the air conditioning room

13:41.200 --> 13:43.266
or air circulating system
for maximum effects.

13:43.566 --> 13:44.933
We can't be so sure about that either.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.400
Figuring out the exact situation inside
is the key.

13:54.033 --> 13:54.933
Yes.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.933
It shall be done.

14:05.466 --> 14:06.600
What's the order?

14:07.666 --> 14:10.433
We will state our demand
for our next step.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.333
Let them in.

14:15.733 --> 14:16.766
This time,

14:17.800 --> 14:19.233
I will be stating our demand myself.

14:24.033 --> 14:25.266
You can't go in there, Hyun-jun.

14:25.433 --> 14:26.400
Send someone else.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.266
Why?

14:28.366 --> 14:30.633
Do you seriously not know?
It's Iris we're dealing with.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.366
You're one of their most wanted targets.

14:32.766 --> 14:34.500
It's dangerous for anyone else as well.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.133
Hyun-jun...

14:38.766 --> 14:39.966
There is Sa-woo in there.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.666
That's all I have faith in.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.600
Sa-woo

14:44.600 --> 14:47.066
wouldn't kill a man
that came for a negotiation.

16:41.466 --> 16:42.533
Step outside.

17:01.900 --> 17:02.833
Sit.

17:48.933 --> 17:50.866
You said that I know nothing about you.

17:51.433 --> 17:52.566
So I thought about it.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.366
To see if it's true.

17:56.233 --> 17:58.066
During the long years
that we've known each other,

17:59.200 --> 18:01.066
what did I know about you

18:03.400 --> 18:04.933
and what were

18:05.566 --> 18:07.100
-the memories that--
-Enough.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.133
You are here to negotiate.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.300
-Just say if you'll meet our demands or--
-No, Sa-woo, listen to me.

18:17.566 --> 18:18.933
Just like what you said...

18:23.533 --> 18:25.500
there were many things
that I didn't know about you.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.733
Thinking we were closer
than brothers by blood

18:29.000 --> 18:30.533
was just a vague feeling.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.000
I really didn't know much about you.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.633
You know that one time after a long march,

18:42.200 --> 18:43.766
when we went to Itaewon,

18:44.800 --> 18:45.766
you took me

18:46.933 --> 18:48.233
to a tattoo shop

18:48.600 --> 18:50.333
and asked to get a tattoo together.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.933
But...

18:56.200 --> 18:57.833
when I saw the lousy bird tattoo on you,

18:59.500 --> 19:00.800
which was supposed to be a phoenix,

19:01.366 --> 19:02.533
it seemed too childish.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.866
So I turned you down

19:05.933 --> 19:07.466
in the end.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.233
Now that I think of it,

19:13.333 --> 19:14.533
I regret not getting the tattoo,

19:18.100 --> 19:19.333
which could have been a memory

19:20.633 --> 19:21.866
of us

19:23.500 --> 19:25.133
that could have lasted forever.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.833
Why didn't I get it?

19:28.066 --> 19:29.000
Enough!

19:36.533 --> 19:37.466
You and I,

19:38.800 --> 19:40.266
we both went too far

19:41.866 --> 19:42.766
to be talking about

19:44.200 --> 19:45.733
past memories.

19:47.966 --> 19:49.500
Even if I don't know anything about you,

19:50.833 --> 19:52.100
I know this one thing.

19:55.566 --> 19:57.333
You made a wrong choice.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.400
Your decision is already
making you regret.

20:02.466 --> 20:03.500
Am I wrong?

20:09.133 --> 20:10.533
How could you, Sa-woo Jin,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.300
be holding little kids as hostage
and blackmail?

20:14.866 --> 20:16.100
This isn't you!

20:22.100 --> 20:24.600
Stop with the non-sense
and state your conditions.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.233
No,

20:26.900 --> 20:28.466
I will tell you our demands

20:29.100 --> 20:30.233
first.

20:30.633 --> 20:31.966
Release all the personnel

20:33.000 --> 20:34.400
related to Iris

20:35.900 --> 20:37.166
that are imprisoned in North Korea.

20:53.066 --> 20:55.600
The terrorists made another demand.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.000
To release Iris members in the North

20:59.166 --> 21:01.733
and to send them to China and Syria.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.900
That is beyond our capability.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.166
This means that we call off the discussion
without consent of the North

21:07.233 --> 21:08.900
and start an intervention.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.100
Call Chul-young Park.

21:13.833 --> 21:14.766
Yes, sir.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.633
Yes, sir.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.300
I will inform the Director about this.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.133
Yes. I will contact you again shortly.

21:30.066 --> 21:31.633
They have another demand

21:32.100 --> 21:33.666
other than canceling
the summit discussion.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.500
It is to release the prisoners

21:36.800 --> 21:40.766
related to Iris that Supreme Guard is
investigating, and to send them overseas.

21:46.433 --> 21:48.966
Is there any possibility to end this
with infiltration operation?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.500
The hostage takers

21:51.000 --> 21:52.800
are no ordinary terrorists.

21:53.433 --> 21:55.266
Their current leader, Sa-woo Jin,

21:55.700 --> 21:59.000
was the best anti-terrorist specialist
within the Special Task Force.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.600
With him, taking part,

22:02.733 --> 22:05.466
rescue with no casualty will be difficult.

22:05.566 --> 22:07.533
If I cancel the summit discussion,

22:08.366 --> 22:11.033
is there a possibility
that they will free the hostages safely?

22:11.666 --> 22:12.966
To be honest...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.500
It's hard to say for sure.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.133
The president

22:34.400 --> 22:35.900
has approved the infiltration operation.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.133
Is he willing to sacrifice the hostages?

22:38.333 --> 22:39.966
Even if we accept their demands,

22:40.133 --> 22:42.166
the NSS headquarters believe
that it would be

22:43.233 --> 22:45.033
difficult for the hostages
to return safely.

22:45.966 --> 22:47.666
Since the sacrifice is inevitable,

22:48.666 --> 22:51.000
to minimize the casualty is the key.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.200
We accept all your demands.

23:23.733 --> 23:24.733
That's good news.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.433
We can minimize unnecessary sacrifice.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.533
There is one condition.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.266
State it.

23:33.866 --> 23:35.633
Let women and children leave first.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.666
We said we'd accept all your demands.

23:45.933 --> 23:47.333
It's not the entire hostages,

23:47.966 --> 23:49.333
just women and children.

23:50.533 --> 23:51.433
All right.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.033
Take them out.

23:57.766 --> 23:59.600
Let women and children free.

24:02.466 --> 24:03.633
I can't do that.

24:09.666 --> 24:10.766
What are you doing?

24:12.400 --> 24:15.033
To kill every single hostage here

24:16.300 --> 24:18.100
is the order I received.

24:19.566 --> 24:20.533
Who...

24:22.233 --> 24:24.066
Who gave you such orders?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.433
Mr. Black.

25:29.966 --> 25:31.000
Team Alpha, enter.

25:31.266 --> 25:32.366
Team Bravo, enter.

25:40.666 --> 25:41.666
Go!

26:09.433 --> 26:10.266
Hey!

26:10.833 --> 26:11.766
Crazy boy!

26:31.533 --> 26:32.500
Sa-woo!

26:37.700 --> 26:38.966
Sa... Sa-woo!

26:40.500 --> 26:41.666
Sa-woo!

26:41.966 --> 26:42.800
Sa-woo.

26:42.866 --> 26:44.400
Sa-woo! Sa-woo!

26:47.933 --> 26:49.233
Sa-woo. Sa-woo, hold it together.

27:01.933 --> 27:03.333
You bastard...

27:05.300 --> 27:06.533
made...

27:07.533 --> 27:08.700
me...

27:11.166 --> 27:13.100
so lonely...

27:24.900 --> 27:26.066
I...

27:30.366 --> 27:31.333
never...

27:34.300 --> 27:35.266
I never...

27:35.933 --> 27:38.000
-I never...
-I know. I know.

27:38.466 --> 27:39.866
I know how you feel, Sa-woo.

27:39.933 --> 27:41.066
I know how you feel.

27:42.066 --> 27:43.366
You don't have to waste your breath.

27:43.433 --> 27:45.166
Don't say anything.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.100
I've

27:49.500 --> 27:50.733
never

27:52.100 --> 27:54.066
doubted you, Sa-woo.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.800
I know how you feel.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.733
Sa-woo, Sa-woo!

28:06.066 --> 28:06.933
Sa-woo.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.600
Sa-woo, Sa-woo.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.200
Sa-woo, hold it together.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.433
Sa-woo, hold it together!

28:20.500 --> 28:21.666
Hold it together! Sa-woo!

28:21.733 --> 28:22.766
Sa-woo...

28:28.533 --> 28:29.633
Sa-woo.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.666
Sa-woo...

29:03.300 --> 29:04.366
Sa-woo!

29:14.900 --> 29:15.933
Sa-woo...

29:29.233 --> 29:30.666
you didn't exist

29:32.033 --> 29:33.300
in my heart!

29:37.000 --> 29:38.633
I will never forgive you.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.133
I...

29:46.333 --> 29:47.633
I'm sorry...

29:52.400 --> 29:53.400
I...

29:53.666 --> 29:55.300
I made your life...

29:56.733 --> 29:57.766
difficult...

29:59.066 --> 30:00.366
Don't be sorry.

30:09.466 --> 30:10.633
Sa-woo!

30:10.700 --> 30:11.766
Sa-woo.

30:11.866 --> 30:13.233
-Sa-woo!
-Sa-woo.

30:13.866 --> 30:14.933
Sa-woo...

30:19.900 --> 30:21.066
Sa-woo...

30:22.200 --> 30:23.300
Sa-woo!

30:23.466 --> 30:24.766
Sa-woo!

30:25.933 --> 30:27.266
Sa-woo...

30:31.333 --> 30:32.366
Sa-woo...

30:53.466 --> 30:54.600
I know how you feel.

30:58.033 --> 30:59.166
I know how you feel.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.100
Sa-woo...

31:33.766 --> 31:35.066
I heard all about Sa-woo.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.833
I shouldn't have

31:40.600 --> 31:42.666
brought him to the NSS.

31:46.866 --> 31:48.000
It's all my fault.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.633
Your fault is

31:50.100 --> 31:51.900
stopping me from killing

31:52.100 --> 31:53.200
San Baek.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.033
I can't stand the fact that the man

31:59.166 --> 32:00.933
who gave everyone around me so much pain

32:02.366 --> 32:03.500
and killed them all

32:06.966 --> 32:08.200
is still alive.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.166
I told you...

32:13.200 --> 32:16.066
we can inflict more pain if he's alive.

32:22.033 --> 32:23.566
The Blue House summoned you.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.500
911 EMERGENCY

32:36.900 --> 32:39.133
Seung-hee, why are you like that?

32:39.333 --> 32:41.000
The director told us to clean up the scene

32:41.966 --> 32:43.166
and report quickly.

32:45.133 --> 32:46.233
You should go ahead.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.300
I'll be there soon.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.066
Yes.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.366
-Hello, sir.
-Great work.

33:44.700 --> 33:47.100
I'm sorry that I couldn't stop
some of the civilian casualties.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.600
But thanks to that sacrifice,

33:49.866 --> 33:51.100
it showed them

33:51.566 --> 33:54.400
that they can no longer destroy our will.

33:56.133 --> 33:59.600
To get to the press conference in time
as scheduled,

33:59.733 --> 34:01.366
you must leave in ten minutes.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.366
To check on the preparation,

34:03.866 --> 34:06.166
I will leave now, sir.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.333
Okay.

34:15.666 --> 34:16.866
I know it is rude,

34:17.199 --> 34:18.500
but may I ask you a question?

34:18.566 --> 34:19.900
Yes, what is it?

34:20.766 --> 34:22.033
This summit discussion,

34:22.766 --> 34:25.100
is it worth all this

34:25.900 --> 34:27.199
sacrifice?

34:28.733 --> 34:30.433
Well, are you asking

34:31.933 --> 34:35.300
the value of the reunification of Korea?

34:37.733 --> 34:39.266
For every historical development

34:40.766 --> 34:42.466
follows great pain.

34:43.133 --> 34:45.333
If we avoid it because of the pain,

34:46.066 --> 34:47.933
we won't be able to achieve anything.

34:50.133 --> 34:51.666
I thought we shared

34:52.166 --> 34:53.733
the same vision?

34:54.866 --> 34:55.766
I...

34:58.233 --> 34:59.400
am not sure.

35:01.466 --> 35:02.766
For the past two years,

35:03.866 --> 35:05.333
most of the people who were sacrificed

35:06.133 --> 35:08.900
had no direct relationships
with the summit discussion

35:09.666 --> 35:11.233
or reunification of Korea.

35:13.866 --> 35:15.266
I'm not sure if historical development

35:15.400 --> 35:17.100
has any meaning to those

35:18.766 --> 35:20.200
who have been

35:22.766 --> 35:24.000
sacrificed till now.

35:24.866 --> 35:26.966
We were victorious today.

35:27.366 --> 35:28.733
We must inform the public

35:29.733 --> 35:33.466
that we overcame an obstacle.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.266
I hope...

35:38.066 --> 35:39.466
you would be joining me there.

35:55.733 --> 35:56.966
We checked the surroundings.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.233
It's clear.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.000
It's clear.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.366
I'm the NSS Counter-terrorism Team Leader,
Seung-hee Choi.

36:34.266 --> 36:35.300
Are you informed

36:35.433 --> 36:37.733
that the NSS and the security team
are cooperating?

36:37.800 --> 36:38.700
Yes, ma'am.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.700
I'd like the information
on Code One's travel route.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.933
The zone in front of the press
is the photo zone.

36:44.733 --> 36:47.733
Code One and other VIPs would appear
on Road Section A

36:48.000 --> 36:49.366
and come this way.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.100
After taking some pictures with the press,
he will move to the conference room.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.100
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.100
SEUNG-HEE SECRETARY PARK

37:14.166 --> 37:15.133
CALLING SEUNG-HEE

37:34.366 --> 37:35.666
SECRETARY SANG-HYUN PARK

37:41.333 --> 37:42.266
Hello, sir.

37:42.566 --> 37:43.500
Where are you?

37:43.666 --> 37:45.566
I brought the bodies of the terrorists

37:45.700 --> 37:47.933
and their leftovers from the field
to the headquarters. You?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.666
I'm escorting Code One
and heading to the conference right now.

37:51.733 --> 37:52.566
Sir,

37:53.100 --> 37:55.333
do you know where Ms. Seung-hee Choi is?

37:55.600 --> 37:56.566
Seung-hee Choi?

37:57.466 --> 37:58.533
No, I don't know.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.300
I thought she got back here ahead of me,
but she's not here.

38:01.666 --> 38:04.400
The security team asked for
Seung-hee's security check.

38:04.666 --> 38:05.933
She's at the conference.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.133
The conference?

38:07.766 --> 38:09.466
You heard her, right?
She's at the conference.

38:09.533 --> 38:10.433
Yes, I heard.

38:11.366 --> 38:12.366
All right.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.500
Hey! Secretary Park.

38:22.566 --> 38:23.533
Secretary Park!

38:24.333 --> 38:25.633
Hey, Secretary Park! Secretary Park!

38:25.800 --> 38:26.800
Hey, Secretary Park.

38:26.866 --> 38:28.600
Have you seen a ghost? What's the matter?

38:28.766 --> 38:32.000
-We killed the wrong people.
-What? What do you mean?

38:32.300 --> 38:35.000
The dead terrorists...
They were not terrorists.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.966
The identity of the dead bodies came out.

38:39.366 --> 38:41.433
Most we thought as terrorists

38:41.600 --> 38:43.633
were in fact the hostages
at the shopping mall.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.066
They dressed the hostages
as the terrorists.

38:47.566 --> 38:48.466
What?

38:48.833 --> 38:49.700
It's crazy.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.500
Please make haste.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.166
David.

39:04.233 --> 39:05.166
Go to the press.

39:37.866 --> 39:39.433
Arriving in three minutes.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.466
SECRETARY SANG-HYUN PARK

39:48.000 --> 39:48.900
Yes.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.733
-We got a problem.
-What is it?

39:50.800 --> 39:52.333
The terrorists all fled the scene.

39:53.466 --> 39:55.000
The ones we killed were not them,

39:55.666 --> 39:57.633
but hostages that were dressed
as terrorists!

39:58.566 --> 40:00.400
I'm not sure
if they have any other intention.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.333
They will arrive shortly.

40:17.933 --> 40:19.366
Code One arriving in one minute.

40:19.433 --> 40:20.533
Checking positions.

40:20.866 --> 40:22.066
Sierra One check.

40:22.366 --> 40:23.633
Sierra Two check.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.400
Sierra Three check.

40:25.933 --> 40:26.833
Okay.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.233
The snipers are in position.

40:30.733 --> 40:32.066
Rappel Team, go.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.500
The rest

40:35.900 --> 40:36.933
standby here.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.666
The VIPs will arrive first

41:04.933 --> 41:06.766
and then Code One will be here.

42:22.966 --> 42:24.666
-It's cold today.
-Yes.

44:21.566 --> 44:22.533
HYUN-JUN

44:24.433 --> 44:25.433
HYUN-JUN

45:23.133 --> 45:24.633
-Take the president!
-Yes, sir!

45:32.766 --> 45:34.166
We should move by car!

45:35.166 --> 45:36.200
Move!

46:55.533 --> 46:56.500
Sun-hwa!

47:03.133 --> 47:04.233
No, no!

47:04.900 --> 47:05.866
Hold it together!

47:06.233 --> 47:07.200
Hold it together!

47:07.533 --> 47:08.500
Sun-hwa, hold it together.

47:08.733 --> 47:09.700
Hold it together.

47:09.933 --> 47:10.933
Don't lose consciousness.

47:12.433 --> 47:13.366
Ambulance!

47:14.200 --> 47:15.200
Call an ambulance!

47:15.733 --> 47:16.700
How's the President?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.166
How could you?

47:42.133 --> 47:43.033
No.

47:43.566 --> 47:44.833
It wasn't me.

47:49.066 --> 47:50.500
My ideals

47:52.966 --> 47:54.333
were too big for you

47:55.200 --> 47:56.400
to handle.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.533
I found someone large enough

47:58.600 --> 47:59.900
to take me in.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.833
So, I'm just breaking

48:03.200 --> 48:04.400
the little useless one.

49:26.366 --> 49:27.266
Thank you.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.300
The best warrior of our republic

49:30.800 --> 49:32.033
risked her life to save yours.

49:32.266 --> 49:35.033
Isn't saying "thank you"
with a couple of flowers not enough?

49:35.633 --> 49:36.766
I was thinking

49:37.500 --> 49:38.700
on my way here,

49:39.666 --> 49:40.933
but nothing came in my mind.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.433
I will be stepping outside.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.066
Think of something nice.

50:05.333 --> 50:06.366
Are...

50:08.533 --> 50:10.666
these flowers really all?

50:11.866 --> 50:12.766
What?

51:03.933 --> 51:05.533
I'm going back to Pyeongyang tomorrow.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.200
I will be back with the President.

51:09.433 --> 51:11.266
What will I be doing by then?

51:12.233 --> 51:13.266
Well,

51:13.733 --> 51:15.533
I won't be beside the president for sure.

51:17.100 --> 51:19.800
I don't want to be tangled
in such a terrible fate anymore.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.700
I don't know when we'll meet again,

51:30.166 --> 51:32.666
but I hope we won't be pointing guns
at each other.

51:44.633 --> 51:45.900
I have something to confess.

51:47.833 --> 51:48.800
At the moment...

51:51.566 --> 51:52.733
when the president

51:53.433 --> 51:55.133
showed up at the conference--

51:55.200 --> 51:56.433
No, don't say it.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.100
The debt you have

52:03.033 --> 52:04.600
in your heart,

52:05.100 --> 52:06.766
I know it isn't easy to just walk it off.

52:08.766 --> 52:10.033
When I was asleep,

52:12.333 --> 52:14.466
you said you prayed for me
so I wouldn't have nightmares?

52:21.300 --> 52:22.533
I will do that for you now.

52:25.000 --> 52:25.933
So

52:26.366 --> 52:27.933
you can be free

52:29.466 --> 52:30.766
from your dark past.

52:56.566 --> 52:58.600
THREE MONTHS LATER

53:13.733 --> 53:14.700
Hey, Secretary Park.

53:15.233 --> 53:16.666
Oh, Secretary Hwang is here too?

53:17.133 --> 53:18.766
Let's go dine together, it's on me!

53:18.833 --> 53:19.733
-Wow.
-Wow.

53:19.800 --> 53:22.000
-Why are you doing this?
-Do you have good news?

53:22.433 --> 53:23.500
Today,

53:23.766 --> 53:26.233
five times in a row, the stock price
is above average!

53:26.733 --> 53:30.766
During 30 years of my investment life,
never have I hit a jackpot like this!

53:31.566 --> 53:33.166
Bravo! Congratulations.

53:33.600 --> 53:34.466
You didn't

53:34.533 --> 53:35.866
set it up, did you?

53:36.200 --> 53:37.533
Hey, Mrs. Hwang.

53:38.366 --> 53:39.333
I'm just joking.

53:39.766 --> 53:40.700
What type of stock?

53:41.433 --> 53:42.766
Who cares about those things.

53:42.866 --> 53:45.300
I just dip my foot in,
and it's a jackpot, you know?

53:46.133 --> 53:48.633
Wow, the summit discussion
is surely something,

53:48.700 --> 53:50.333
suppressing all the misfortune.

53:51.066 --> 53:52.166
It's on you for sure, okay?

53:52.233 --> 53:53.100
of course.

53:53.500 --> 53:56.000
Make sure to contact Hyun-jun
and Seung-hee.

53:56.466 --> 53:57.666
Don't look for them.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.133
They are never coming back.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.600
What?

54:06.366 --> 54:07.433
Right...

54:22.900 --> 54:24.300
Are you just going to sleep?

54:30.500 --> 54:32.000
Oh, just a little longer.

54:32.833 --> 54:33.833
Hey,

54:34.433 --> 54:35.466
I'm hungry.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.266
Ask for a room service for now.

54:42.366 --> 54:43.566
Are you going to be like this?

54:45.600 --> 54:46.633
Go wash yourself.

54:50.133 --> 54:51.300
Were you always like this?

54:51.666 --> 54:52.600
What?

54:53.000 --> 54:54.866
Were you always so nagging?

54:56.066 --> 54:57.966
You call this nagging?

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
Oh my God...

55:00.233 --> 55:02.100
Hurry, get up!

55:02.766 --> 55:03.900
-Get up.
-Ouch.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.400
-Hurry.
-Ouch.

55:05.833 --> 55:07.000
Come on, for real.

55:08.033 --> 55:09.033
-Ouch.
-Get up.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.200
All right, all right...

55:11.366 --> 55:12.266
Hey!

55:13.600 --> 55:14.700
Oh, my back.

55:15.166 --> 55:16.133
Pull yourself together!

55:20.700 --> 55:21.733
Hey, you single-minded lady.

55:22.000 --> 55:22.966
You must be single-minded.

55:24.266 --> 55:27.000
You cry when hungry, happy when fed.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.466
Do you think you're any different?

55:29.900 --> 55:30.866
What about me?

55:31.633 --> 55:33.300
Last night, you wouldn't let me sleep--

55:33.366 --> 55:35.466
Hey, when did I? What did I do?

55:36.400 --> 55:37.466
Well,

55:37.533 --> 55:38.566
I like it.

56:24.133 --> 56:25.333
They are so cute, right?

56:25.400 --> 56:26.433
They are pretty.

56:27.033 --> 56:28.066
Hey, should we

56:29.033 --> 56:30.033
make five?

56:30.466 --> 56:32.166
-What?
-Our children.

56:33.533 --> 56:34.566
Dream on.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.766
What is this?

56:37.833 --> 56:38.933
Are you proposing?

56:39.233 --> 56:40.666
Well, you can say that.

56:45.733 --> 56:47.000
Just make five for me.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.200
Will you?

56:49.066 --> 56:52.066
You call this a propose,
even without a ring?

56:52.366 --> 56:54.133
Nope, I can't accept this, not at all.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.666
Hey, why are you so picky?

56:55.733 --> 56:56.733
Hey!

57:37.533 --> 57:38.900
DIARY

57:41.033 --> 57:43.833
FIRST KISS
