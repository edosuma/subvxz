WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:10.900
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.900
But is it any good?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.233
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.333 --> 00:14.267
but I don't review

00:14.367 --> 00:15.900
food, books, or movies.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I review life itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.600
[screams]

00:19.700 --> 00:21.533
[triumphant music]

00:21.633 --> 00:22.433
[parrot squawks]

00:22.533 --> 00:26.800
*

00:26.900 --> 00:28.033
Over here.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.200
*

00:32.100 --> 00:34.700
Hello, and welcome to Review.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.967
I am Forrest MacNeil,

00:36.067 --> 00:38.200
and this is my cohost,
A.J. Gibbs.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.900
Life is a trip.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.267
And this show is my passport.

00:42.367 --> 00:44.633
A.J., where shall we go next?

00:44.733 --> 00:46.433
Gina from Toluca Lake
has a question.

00:46.533 --> 00:48.400
Aha.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.367
Forrest, I've often wondered,

00:50.467 --> 00:54.000
what would it be like
to kill a person?

00:54.100 --> 00:55.000
Whoa.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.500
"Whoa" is exactly right.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.267
[sighs]

00:59.367 --> 01:01.833
I want to choose my words

01:01.933 --> 01:05.100
very carefully here.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.800
Gina, I will do many things,

01:07.900 --> 01:11.233
but to take a life
is wrong beyond all reason.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.533
As a man who reviews life,

01:12.633 --> 01:16.733
I simply have too much
respect for it to end one.

01:16.833 --> 01:17.733
And so,

01:17.833 --> 01:18.767
for the first time

01:18.867 --> 01:21.200
in Review history,

01:21.300 --> 01:25.133
I hereby enact
the power of ...the host veto.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.500
[dramatic music]
Holy [bleep].

01:26.600 --> 01:28.600
*

01:28.700 --> 01:32.567
[drumroll]

01:32.667 --> 01:35.733
[sighs]

01:35.833 --> 01:37.067
Thank you.

01:37.167 --> 01:41.700
*

01:41.800 --> 01:44.167
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

01:44.267 --> 01:45.567
Yes, I am.

01:45.667 --> 01:46.533
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

01:46.633 --> 01:48.700
Yes, I am.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.700
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

01:50.800 --> 01:51.700
Yes, I am.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.600
You may veto
this review.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.067
Thank you, Grant.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.467
A.J., shield your eyes.

01:58.567 --> 01:59.600
[drumroll]

01:59.700 --> 02:01.800
[glass shatters]

02:01.900 --> 02:04.833
Oh.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.200
With solemn regard,

02:07.300 --> 02:09.600
the first host veto
of the season

02:09.700 --> 02:14.100
is hereby dutifully cast
by me, Forrest MacNeil,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.233
being of sound mind.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.467
Killing A Person:

02:17.567 --> 02:19.233
vetoed.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.833
[dramatic musical flourish]

02:20.933 --> 02:24.800
Please destroy this...

02:24.900 --> 02:27.600
and these.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.767
[sighs]

02:28.867 --> 02:31.067
That was exciting!

02:31.167 --> 02:33.800
Okay, you only
have one veto left.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.300
Yes.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.067
I have no doubt that
that was totally necessary,

02:37.167 --> 02:38.733
but I can tell you,
it did not feel good.

02:38.833 --> 02:39.833
All right, let's get on

02:39.933 --> 02:41.633
to the better stuff
that life has to offer.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.433
A.J., what is my next review,
please?

02:43.533 --> 02:46.133
Your next question
is from Erica.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.367
"Disclaimer: I'm pretty high.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.300
"But what would it be like
to let a Magic 8 Ball

02:50.400 --> 02:51.500
make all your decisions?"

02:51.600 --> 02:53.333
Okay.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.600
I guess she's talking about

02:54.700 --> 02:56.067
the children's toy,
the Magic 8 Ball.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.433
Huh.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.133
Living life
by the Magic 8 Ball?

02:59.233 --> 03:01.067
That I will do.

03:01.100 --> 03:01.967
You know what?

03:02.067 --> 03:03.600
It might actually be fun.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.867
Shall I explain
how this is going to work?

03:04.967 --> 03:07.167
[liquid sloshing]

03:07.267 --> 03:08.200
[Forrest chuckles]

03:08.300 --> 03:10.800
"Yes."
Okay.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.100
For the rest of the day,
every decision I have to make,

03:13.200 --> 03:14.267
every question
life throws at me,

03:14.367 --> 03:16.533
I will run it
by the Magic 8 Ball

03:16.633 --> 03:18.500
and do what it
tells me.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.633
And in order
to keep the rest of the world

03:19.733 --> 03:22.533
in the dark about this
rather odd practice,

03:22.633 --> 03:24.367
I'm gonna keep the 8 Ball
here in this fanny pack.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.500
I don't want anyone
to think I'm weird.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.367
So...

03:28.467 --> 03:29.733
Shall I head out into the world?

03:29.833 --> 03:34.400
[fabric rustling]

03:34.500 --> 03:35.900
"Most likely."

03:36.067 --> 03:37.100
Very well then.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.900
Should I
use the men's room?

03:40.067 --> 03:43.100
(Forrest voice-over)
As I set out
on this journey of chance,

03:43.200 --> 03:44.100
the idea of giving up
all of the day's

03:44.200 --> 03:46.600
decision-making
responsibilities

03:46.700 --> 03:49.233
to this children's toy
struck me as a relief...

03:49.333 --> 03:50.733
Should I help
pick this stuff up?

03:50.833 --> 03:52.700
That would be great.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.667
(Forrest voice-over)
Though one with certain risks.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.433
"No."
Sorry.

03:58.533 --> 04:02.433
[Ed muttering indistinctly]

04:02.533 --> 04:04.767
Can I say hello
to these two people?

04:04.867 --> 04:07.233
(Forrest voice-over)
Since 1950,
the iconic Magic 8 Ball,

04:07.333 --> 04:10.533
with its mysterious triangle
afloat

04:10.633 --> 04:13.167
in an inky blue
nontoxic realm,

04:13.267 --> 04:15.300
has provided advice
and premonition

04:15.400 --> 04:17.467
to those adrift
in the inky blue,

04:17.567 --> 04:19.067
often toxic, waters of life.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.700
Can I cross the street?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.533
These "ask again later"s
are a real problem.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.067
The more I embraced
the randomness of life...

04:28.133 --> 04:31.667
Shall I share my food
with this hungry creature?

04:31.767 --> 04:35.067
(Forrest voice-over)
The more meaningful even the
smallest decision seemed to be.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.267
[clicks tongue]

04:37.367 --> 04:40.433
Should I
chase after this squirrel?

04:40.533 --> 04:43.100
(Forrest voice-over)
And I had a lot of fun.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.733
[Forrest chuckling]

04:45.833 --> 04:46.767
Where did--Okay.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.933
Should I follow him
up into the tree?

04:50.067 --> 04:51.967
[grunting]

04:52.067 --> 04:53.533
[laughing]
This is great!

04:53.633 --> 04:55.633
(Forrest voice-over)
But, of course, I wasn't happy

04:55.733 --> 04:57.067
with all of the 8 Ball's
decisions.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.067
Shall I have a hot dog?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.800
[fabric rustling]

04:59.900 --> 05:01.833
(Forrest voice-over)
And it soon became clear

05:01.933 --> 05:04.067
that this plastic ball
also had the capacity

05:04.167 --> 05:05.767
to complicate my family life.

05:05.867 --> 05:06.800
[phone rings]
It's Suzanne.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.400
Okay, uh, can I answer this,
please?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.267
(Forrest voice-over)
Despite many attempts
to contact her,

05:11.367 --> 05:13.800
I had not spoken
with my ex-wife Suzanne

05:13.900 --> 05:16.233
since I gave a toast
at her rehearsal dinner,

05:16.333 --> 05:17.833
that caused her
to call off her wedding.

05:17.933 --> 05:19.267
He is constantly sleeping with
baseball groupie whores!

05:19.367 --> 05:20.900
What?
What is going on?

05:21.067 --> 05:22.900
Yes.
Yes!

05:23.067 --> 05:24.267
Yes.
Hello. Hi. Hi.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.633
(Suzanne)
Hi, Forrest, I saw you called
many times.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.933
Yeah, hi.
Hey, what's up?

05:29.067 --> 05:31.867
(Suzanne)
Were you calling to apologize
for ruining my life again?

05:31.967 --> 05:35.067
Uh...

05:35.133 --> 05:37.067
(Suzanne)
Forrest?

05:37.133 --> 05:39.200
Yeah, no, I--just a second.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.233
Uh,
"Better not tell you now."

05:41.333 --> 05:42.633
Okay?

05:42.733 --> 05:44.100
(Suzanne)
"Better not tell me now"?

05:44.200 --> 05:45.367
Yeah.

05:45.467 --> 05:46.833
(Suzanne)
What does that even mean?

05:46.933 --> 05:47.800
Uh...

05:47.900 --> 05:48.733
(Suzanne)
Are you sorry or not?

05:48.833 --> 05:50.667
[fabric rustling]
- Forrest.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.900
Just a second.
Just a second.

05:54.533 --> 05:55.933
"Don't count on it."

05:56.067 --> 05:57.333
(Suzanne)
Really?

05:57.433 --> 05:58.933
All right,
go [bleep] yourself.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.733
- Stop calling me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.067
Ask me another question.
Ask me a different question.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.433
(Forrest voice-over)
While I was ready
to talk through

06:04.533 --> 06:07.067
the issues Suzanne and I
were experiencing,

06:07.133 --> 06:08.900
it was clear
that the Magic 8 Ball was not.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.833
What?

06:15.367 --> 06:17.633
(Forrest voice-over)
With the Magic 8 Ball
guiding my every move,

06:17.733 --> 06:18.833
I ended up far outside
the zip code

06:18.933 --> 06:20.167
where I feel
most comfortable.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.900
Can I please call a cab
to take me home?

06:23.067 --> 06:24.767
(Forrest voice-over)
And the worst was yet to come.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.700
Hey! Hey, man.
Hey, friend!

06:26.800 --> 06:28.867
You have 20 bucks?

06:28.967 --> 06:32.067
Do I want to give this man
$20 to...

06:32.100 --> 06:33.933
probably buy
illegal drugs?

06:37.067 --> 06:38.800
- All right. Here you go.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.800
Now can I please,
please go home?

06:42.900 --> 06:43.733
[bleep].
You're still 10 shy.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.067
[bleep].
I just gave you a 20.

06:46.167 --> 06:47.400
[bleep].
You gave me a 10.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.167
Was that a 20, man?

06:49.267 --> 06:51.167
(Forrest voice-over)
I knew I had given him a 20.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.167
I knew that all I had
were 20s.

06:53.267 --> 06:56.567
I could have easily
settled this dispute.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.067
But the 8 Ball
had brought me

06:58.100 --> 07:00.067
to this bizarre
and troublesome place

07:00.133 --> 07:01.367
and the 8 Ball
would decide

07:01.467 --> 07:03.767
what I did next.

07:03.867 --> 07:04.600
"My reply is no."

07:04.700 --> 07:05.433
(man)
Told you.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.200
That was a 20, man!

07:08.300 --> 07:10.067
- Guess I could ask--
- [bleep].

07:10.167 --> 07:11.333
Oh, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

07:11.433 --> 07:12.733
Oh, whoa.
Oh, God.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.100
Can I get
out of here?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.433
Can I please
get out of here?

07:15.533 --> 07:16.600
[bleep].
Oh, God!

07:16.700 --> 07:18.433
Can I please
get out of here?

07:18.533 --> 07:21.433
[man moaning]

07:21.533 --> 07:22.700
Oh, God!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.200
Please.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.800
- Oh, my God.
- [bleep].

07:25.900 --> 07:26.533
(Ray)
You didn't see [bleep].

07:26.633 --> 07:28.600
(Forrest)
Oh, God.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.233
Can I please
get out of here?

07:32.333 --> 07:34.367
(Forrest voice-over)
Thanks to an incredible streak

07:34.467 --> 07:36.533
of non-answers
and negative answers,

07:36.633 --> 07:38.600
I didn't go anywhere.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.067
[siren wailing]

07:40.167 --> 07:42.933
Can I please, please
go somewhere safe?

07:43.067 --> 07:44.067
(Forrest voice-over)
When the police arrived,

07:44.167 --> 07:46.733
they asked me
a very important question.

07:46.833 --> 07:47.767
A witness
thought she saw

07:47.867 --> 07:49.367
a guy running
from this area.

07:49.467 --> 07:50.800
You recognize
this man?

07:50.900 --> 07:53.500
(Forrest voice-over)
How I longed
to be of service to them.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.200
[fabric rustling]

07:58.300 --> 07:59.467
[indistinct police radio
chatter]

07:59.567 --> 08:02.600
"My reply is no."

08:02.700 --> 08:05.967
All right, guys,
turn him loose.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.967
Thank you very much, sir,
for your cooperation.

08:08.067 --> 08:11.067
(Forrest voice-over)
Arbitrarily made choices

08:11.167 --> 08:13.333
could lead to
inspired exhilaration

08:13.433 --> 08:17.067
or aiding in the escape
of a violent felon.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.767
In the end,
it's always better

08:18.867 --> 08:21.767
to captain one's own ship
on gut instinct.

08:21.867 --> 08:24.167
If I crash
into the rocks of life,

08:24.267 --> 08:28.067
I want it to be because
I steered the ship there myself.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.767
Living your life
by a Magic 8 Ball gets...

08:30.867 --> 08:32.233
one star.

08:35.633 --> 08:38.767
Our next review
comes from Bill in Pasadena.

08:38.867 --> 08:39.700
All righty.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.067
Hey, Forrest.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.800
I was raised
with a good work ethic,

08:42.900 --> 08:44.167
but a lot of the guys
in my office

08:44.267 --> 08:45.900
just screw around all day.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.433
What's it like
to procrastinate?

08:47.533 --> 08:49.967
- Hmm.
- Oh.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.800
My friend has a tumblr

08:51.900 --> 08:54.933
of these panda bears
falling out of trees.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.667
I'll send you
the link.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.233
You will be lost on there
for days.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.900
I'm supposed to follow a link
to a tumblr?

09:00.067 --> 09:01.367
(A.J.)
Yeah.

09:01.467 --> 09:03.300
That right there will take me
most of an afternoon.

09:03.400 --> 09:08.500
Okay, well,
I'm off to procrastinate!

09:08.600 --> 09:13.133
Oh, wow.
Wait a minute.

09:13.233 --> 09:13.867
Oh, I have a problem.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.600
What's the problem?

09:15.700 --> 09:17.300
The problem is,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.800
my task here
is to procrastinate.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.067
Yes.
Good luck!

09:21.167 --> 09:24.500
Well, a procrastinator
doesn't do his task.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.633
Because to procrastinate
is to not do your task.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.900
You know what I mean?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.567
So my task
is to not do my task.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.967
I think--it feels like
there's an impossible logic flaw

09:33.067 --> 09:34.633
at the heart
of this question.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.667
I don't know
if I can do this.

09:36.767 --> 09:40.167
Can I just say sometimes you're
a little rigid on the rules?

09:40.267 --> 09:42.233
- What's the problem?
- Oh. I--

09:42.333 --> 09:45.067
I don't think
I can review procrastinating.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.300
It's impossible.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.467
I can't procrastinate
procrastinating.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.900
Because then I won't be
procrastinating, right?

09:50.067 --> 09:50.867
I'll be procrastinating.

09:50.967 --> 09:51.767
That's the problem.
Yeah.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.667
I mean, this
is like a classic

09:53.767 --> 09:54.700
snake drawing his own hand.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.167
It can't be done.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.367
It can't be done.
It can't be done.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.300
I wish it could be done,
but this--there's no way.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.100
A.J.,

10:01.200 --> 10:02.833
For the second

10:02.933 --> 10:04.867
and final time
this season,

10:04.967 --> 10:07.333
I hereby
enact the power of

10:07.433 --> 10:09.333
the host veto.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.700
Yes!

10:10.800 --> 10:11.667
[dramatic music]

10:11.767 --> 10:12.733
[sighs]
I mean...

10:12.833 --> 10:19.000
*

10:19.100 --> 10:20.133
Thank you, Grant.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.533
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

10:22.633 --> 10:23.833
Yes, I am.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.400
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.833
Yes, I am.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.400
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

10:28.500 --> 10:29.167
Yes, I am.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.400
You may veto
this review.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.133
Thank you, Grant.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.667
A.J., shield your eyes.

10:34.767 --> 10:39.467
[plastic tearing]

10:39.567 --> 10:41.233
With solemn regard,

10:41.333 --> 10:44.633
the second and final host veto
of the season

10:44.733 --> 10:45.933
is hereby been dutifully cast

10:46.033 --> 10:50.567
by me, Forrest MacNeil,
being of sound mind.

10:50.667 --> 10:51.967
Procrastination:

10:52.067 --> 10:53.133
vetoed.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.533
Please destroy this...

10:54.633 --> 10:57.133
and please preserve these
for their historical value.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.967
[sighs]

11:02.067 --> 11:03.400
Okay.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.800
With zero more vetoes left,

11:07.900 --> 11:10.833
here is your next review.

11:10.933 --> 11:11.800
Gina in Toluca Lake?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.667
- Wait a minute.
- Hi.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.133
I did this once already,

11:15.233 --> 11:15.867
but I don't see it
in my sent folder,

11:15.967 --> 11:18.433
so I'm not sure it went.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.067
But anyway,
my question is,

11:20.100 --> 11:24.833
what it would be like
to kill a person?

11:24.933 --> 11:26.833
Wha--no.

11:26.933 --> 11:29.100
I already vetoed--
I vetoed that.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.400
Technically,
this is a new review.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.067
Oh, my God.

11:40.967 --> 11:41.933
[suspenseful music]

11:42.067 --> 11:43.667
Oh, my God.

11:43.767 --> 11:44.700
You know, you could have just
wasted some time

11:44.800 --> 11:46.667
like a normal person.

11:46.767 --> 11:49.567
[door creaks]
- Ah.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.600
Yeah.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.433
(Forrest voice-over)
Moments after a viewer asked me
to kill someone,

11:57.533 --> 11:59.233
I was summoned to a meeting
with my producer Grant

11:59.333 --> 12:00.500
and Review's legal counsel.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.633
There should've been
three vetoes.

12:03.733 --> 12:05.400
(Grant)
Yes.
In retrospect, that is clear.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.700
But alas.

12:06.800 --> 12:11.267
Anyway, I just wanted to make
our position very clear.

12:11.367 --> 12:14.067
You should not commit
a murder for the show.

12:14.133 --> 12:14.700
Period.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.800
I agree with that.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.267
We don't care that it might have
been ground-breaking,

12:22.367 --> 12:24.200
award-winning television

12:24.300 --> 12:26.667
that people talked about
for years.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.367
None of that matters.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.067
We're talking about
a human life.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.567
(Forrest)
That's--yeah. That's right.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.800
It's a human life.

12:32.900 --> 12:33.533
(Grant)
Even if it means
fading into obscurity,

12:33.633 --> 12:34.800
there is no one

12:34.900 --> 12:37.267
whose life is so worthless

12:37.367 --> 12:38.333
that you should do this.

12:38.433 --> 12:39.500
Yep.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.067
(Grant)
Even if by not doing it,

12:41.167 --> 12:42.633
eventually people go,
"Oh, yeah,

12:42.733 --> 12:44.100
"who was that guy
back in the day, Frosty McNell?

12:44.200 --> 12:48.400
He had a show where he
barfed up pancakes?"

12:48.500 --> 12:52.400
And if you did do this thing,
you would be doing it

12:52.500 --> 12:56.400
knowing that not only were you
not told to by the show,

12:56.500 --> 12:59.467
you were expressly told
not to do it.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.633
(Forrest)
Oh.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.800
Okay.
Right.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.800
- Good.
- Yeah, okay.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.133
Yeah.
I got it. I got it.

13:10.233 --> 13:13.633
So you're telling me

13:13.733 --> 13:15.467
I should do this.

13:15.567 --> 13:16.533
(both)
No no no no no.

13:16.633 --> 13:17.833
Not at all.
Quite the opposite.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.167
Absolutely not.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.567
Don't do it.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.567
Got it.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.467
[sighs]

13:23.567 --> 13:24.633
- Okay, thank you, Forrest.

13:24.733 --> 13:28.333
Yeah, no, thank you.
Very good.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.867
(attorney)
Is he gonna do it?

13:32.467 --> 13:35.133
We have told him
not to do it.

13:35.233 --> 13:36.800
[sighs]

13:36.900 --> 13:38.533
[sighs]

13:38.633 --> 13:40.533
(Forrest voice-over)
This was truly the most
horrifying request

13:40.633 --> 13:42.133
in two seasons
as a reviewer of life.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.933
- You wanted to see me?
- Dad, yes.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.367
(Forrest voice-over)
As I grappled with the awful
implications

13:47.467 --> 13:48.400
of what I was being asked to do,

13:48.500 --> 13:51.700
I turned for advice
to my father.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.933
I know that you served
during Vietnam.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.133
Yep, I--I sure did.

13:58.233 --> 13:59.133
Yeah.

13:59.233 --> 14:04.533
I need to know
what it felt like.

14:04.633 --> 14:08.067
I've never talked about this
to anyone,

14:08.133 --> 14:10.067
and with good reason.

14:10.133 --> 14:13.700
I think I need to hear it, Dad.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.100
[sighs]

14:17.200 --> 14:19.500
I joined in 1970.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.067
I enlisted with my friends,

14:21.167 --> 14:23.267
Danny Alfaro
and Jared Lenk.

14:23.367 --> 14:27.300
But right when
we started training,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.633
I came down with
a terrible case of diarrhea

14:30.733 --> 14:31.533
they couldn't do
anything about.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.767
Uh-huh.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.267
They didn't know
if it was a viral thing

14:36.367 --> 14:38.267
or an intestinal
inflammation

14:38.367 --> 14:41.367
or--they couldn't even
keep me hydrated.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.067
Okay, but then at some point,
you, you know--

14:43.167 --> 14:44.767
they shipped you out.

14:44.867 --> 14:47.967
They transferred me to
a medical center in Oklahoma.

14:48.067 --> 14:51.167
They had a whole
team of doctors

14:51.267 --> 14:51.767
trying to figure
this thing out.

14:51.867 --> 14:52.800
The diarrhea.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.933
And my paperwork
got mucked up.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.067
Uh-huh.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.400
Spent the next 2 1/2 years

15:00.500 --> 15:03.500
bouncing around
in the hospital system.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.333
Did you say
you spent 2 1/2 years

15:05.433 --> 15:08.667
just in the hospital
in the United States?

15:08.767 --> 15:11.200
- Studied transistor radios.
- Uh-huh.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.167
I learned to cook.

15:12.267 --> 15:14.133
They made me
an honorary nurse.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.567
Did they?

15:15.667 --> 15:17.367
Yeah, 'cause I was around
so much.

15:17.467 --> 15:18.767
Okay, sorry, I just--

15:18.867 --> 15:19.867
I didn't have
anything else to do.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.433
Got it.
I wanted to--I just wanted to--

15:21.533 --> 15:25.333
I mean, you never killed anybody
over there or anything?

15:25.433 --> 15:26.367
As a nurse, you mean?

15:26.467 --> 15:29.800
No, I mean,
you know, in war.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.633
Oh, God, no.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.633
I have a lot of stuff
to get to.

15:35.733 --> 15:37.233
But you know,
to this day...

15:37.333 --> 15:37.900
Yeah?

15:38.067 --> 15:41.067
I get the trots,

15:41.100 --> 15:44.233
I go right back there.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.233
Sure.

15:46.333 --> 15:49.833
Sounds like that was a...

15:49.933 --> 15:52.733
life-changing
case of diarrhea there.

15:52.833 --> 15:56.067
(Forrest voice-over)
My father's input
was equal parts

15:56.100 --> 15:56.933
disgusting and unhelpful.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.100
But I did eventually

15:59.200 --> 16:01.167
think of someone I could kill.

16:01.267 --> 16:02.867
I tracked down the young man

16:02.967 --> 16:04.667
whose brutal beating
I had witnessed

16:04.767 --> 16:06.933
and learned
that he was in a coma

16:07.067 --> 16:08.567
with less than a 1% chance

16:08.667 --> 16:12.200
of ever
regaining consciousness.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.200
This feels like...

16:15.300 --> 16:17.767
the least bad way.

16:17.867 --> 16:21.367
[sighs]

16:21.467 --> 16:21.867
[machine beeping]

16:21.967 --> 16:25.767
[sighs]

16:25.867 --> 16:26.967
[sighs]

16:27.067 --> 16:29.333
This is--I mean--

16:29.433 --> 16:31.767
Yeah. Okay. All right.

16:31.867 --> 16:32.833
[groans]

16:32.933 --> 16:33.967
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]
[bleep] [bleep].

16:34.067 --> 16:36.333
No!
No, no!

16:36.433 --> 16:37.833
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

16:37.933 --> 16:38.700
I can't do it.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.633
[panting]
[door clicks shut]

16:40.733 --> 16:43.067
[panting]

16:43.167 --> 16:44.200
[bleep] that.
No.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.600
Nope.
[clears throat]

16:45.700 --> 16:48.767
[sighs]
I can't do it.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.267
Oh, God.

16:50.367 --> 16:53.333
(Forrest voice-over)
But then I realized
that I knew someone

16:53.433 --> 16:56.167
who was much more deserving
of my murder.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.067
Ray, the man who administered

16:58.167 --> 17:00.233
that horrible beating
and got away with it,

17:00.333 --> 17:02.800
arguably partly because of me,

17:02.900 --> 17:04.600
was surely a man I could kill

17:04.700 --> 17:06.467
with a somewhat softer
pang of guilt.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.233
Finding Ray turned out to be
remarkably easy.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.433
I'm looking for this man.

17:11.533 --> 17:13.900
He sells drugs around here.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.567
(Forrest voice-over)
He was well-known
throughout the neighborhood.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.067
I've just come from Walmart

17:19.167 --> 17:21.333
where I purchased a gun

17:21.433 --> 17:22.567
and some ammunition

17:22.667 --> 17:24.067
and several
impulse purchases too.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.133
I don't know.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.167
Who can resist a $2 lawn chair?

17:28.267 --> 17:29.167
Certainly not me.

17:29.267 --> 17:30.200
This is Ray lives.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.533
And I'm gonna go in there

17:31.633 --> 17:34.533
and I'm gonna do
what I need to do...

17:34.633 --> 17:37.100
[breathing heavily]
with this gun.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.200
And I'm very, very frightened.

17:38.300 --> 17:42.467
[car door dinging]

17:42.567 --> 17:43.533
[door slams]

17:47.633 --> 17:50.533
I want you to keep
a safe distance, okay?

18:08.133 --> 18:09.167
[crying quietly]

18:09.267 --> 18:10.933
[knocks at door]

18:13.133 --> 18:14.067
[door creaks open]

18:14.167 --> 18:15.067
Hey!

18:18.567 --> 18:20.167
Oh.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.367
I know you.

18:22.467 --> 18:24.567
You're the guy
from the other night

18:24.667 --> 18:26.600
when the cops grabbed me.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.833
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

18:27.933 --> 18:30.067
Nothing.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.333
This is a miracle, man.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.333
You are my [bleep]
guardian angel, man.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.067
- [laughs]
- [groans]

18:37.100 --> 18:38.200
I been thinkin'
about you all the time.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.367
You not ratting me
out like that,

18:41.467 --> 18:42.967
that was the best
[bleep] thing

18:43.067 --> 18:44.533
anyone has ever done for me
in my whole [bleep] life.

18:44.633 --> 18:49.200
It's like I got a real chance
to start over.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.467
I'm not gonna
[bleep] it up.

18:51.567 --> 18:53.900
I already enrolled
to take the GED!

18:54.067 --> 18:54.833
I'ma get sober.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.367
I'ma be a drug counselor
for teens.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.533
(Forrest voice-over)
In less than a minute,
this monster,

18:59.633 --> 19:01.767
who I had so easily
condemned to death

19:01.867 --> 19:03.333
had become a human to me.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.367
(Ray)
This is my son.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.467
His name is Eric.

19:05.567 --> 19:06.867
I have a son named Eric.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.533
(Forrest voice-over)
A man with a future

19:08.633 --> 19:09.400
and a right to go on living.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.300
- Hi, Ray.
- Ray Dunkelman.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.633
Bring it in.

19:12.733 --> 19:13.533
(Forrest voice-over)
I knew I could not do it.

19:13.633 --> 19:15.467
I could not kill
Ray Dunkelman.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.833
Yeah, Forrest!

19:16.933 --> 19:18.800
(Forrest voice-over)
It was a heartwarming moment.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.267
And then Ray discovered
something.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.533
What the [bleep]
is this?

19:21.633 --> 19:23.100
- What do you mean?
- Whoa, hey.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.700
- What are you doing?
- Are you wearing a wire?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.467
(Forrest voice-over)
It was simply the microphone

19:26.567 --> 19:28.067
that records my audio
for this show.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.700
But Ray was not listening
to explanations.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.133
[Ray shouting indistinctly]

19:32.233 --> 19:36.700
[smacking and shouting]

19:36.800 --> 19:37.333
[Ray screaming]

19:37.433 --> 19:38.533
You bit me!

19:38.633 --> 19:41.700
[screaming]
What the [bleep], Forrest?

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
[both screaming]

19:47.833 --> 19:49.567
[Forrest screaming]

19:49.667 --> 19:52.267
[gunshot]

19:52.367 --> 19:54.333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.567
Oh, my God.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.633
[grunting]

20:00.767 --> 20:03.067
There should have been
another veto.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.733
There should have been
another veto.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.567
There should have been
another veto.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.167
[sobbing]

20:09.267 --> 20:11.600
Whoa.
Forrest.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.367
That was pretty intense.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.033
Was it?

20:16.133 --> 20:16.967
[clears throat]

20:17.067 --> 20:21.567
If, in fact,
what you had just seen

20:21.667 --> 20:24.033
had been the killing
of one person

20:24.133 --> 20:25.767
by another person,

20:25.867 --> 20:28.767
then I suppose
that other person

20:28.867 --> 20:30.367
would have found
the experience

20:30.467 --> 20:33.367
to have been
highly traumatizing,

20:33.467 --> 20:35.767
resulting in
a ceaseless barrage

20:35.867 --> 20:39.933
of nightmares and daymares

20:40.033 --> 20:43.467
that will probably
haunt him or her

20:43.567 --> 20:45.400
for the rest of his life.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.033
Killing someone,
therefore,

20:48.133 --> 20:52.233
theoretically gets,

20:52.333 --> 20:54.033
I'm assuming...

20:54.133 --> 20:56.067
half a star.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.100
Just so you know,
the guy in the coma died too.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.533
Oh, is that right?

21:05.633 --> 21:07.700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:09.433 --> 21:10.067
(man)
Extra cheese!
