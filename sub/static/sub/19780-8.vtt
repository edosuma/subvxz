WEBVTT

00:08.162 --> 00:10.029
Good morning, Sunshine.

00:11.799 --> 00:13.566
Or not.

00:13.568 --> 00:16.202
I bought that painting
at a gallery in Munich.

00:16.204 --> 00:18.505
Okay, I'll have Ken take it down for you.

00:18.507 --> 00:21.241
- Ken?
- Yeah, my new assistant.

00:23.177 --> 00:25.645
My new "interim" assistant.

00:25.647 --> 00:27.213
Okay, I'm gonna be upfront
with you, Charlie.

00:27.215 --> 00:28.681
I want my office back.

00:28.683 --> 00:30.316
Yeah, I could tell that by
the way you just broke in here.

00:30.318 --> 00:31.951
I did not break in here.

00:31.953 --> 00:33.820
I still have keys.

00:33.822 --> 00:36.456
Okay, Dawn, we'll share the office.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.758
We'll get bunk desks.
Be like when we were married.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.360
Oh, you mean like inhabit the same space,

00:40.362 --> 00:41.828
but not acknowledge each other's presence?

00:41.830 --> 00:43.696
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

00:43.698 --> 00:46.966
Mm, yeah, that's what we say
about a colonoscopy...

00:46.968 --> 00:49.168
not a marriage.

00:51.273 --> 00:52.939
I should still be chief of surgery.

00:52.941 --> 00:55.475
Maybe, but that's not my call.

00:57.312 --> 00:58.645
Luke has a fever.

00:58.647 --> 01:00.847
What? I just dropped him off.

01:00.849 --> 01:02.282
Well, I went to the daycare to go say hi,

01:02.284 --> 01:04.183
but they need either you
or Alex to go get him.

01:04.185 --> 01:06.052
Well, Alex is away this weekend.

01:06.054 --> 01:08.121
What... how high is his temperature?

01:08.123 --> 01:10.156
Can you excuse us? This is a family matter.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.825
Okay.

01:14.028 --> 01:15.728
It was 100 degrees on the dot.

01:15.730 --> 01:17.030
What?!

01:17.032 --> 01:18.431
Charlie, I saw a little girl there.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.700
She had mucus all over her face.

01:20.702 --> 01:22.035
She had our book in...

01:22.037 --> 01:23.636
Charlie, she had our book in her mouth.

01:23.638 --> 01:24.704
Yeah, yeah. Yes, Shahir.

01:24.706 --> 01:26.439
I'll go... I'll go grab him right now.

01:26.441 --> 01:28.708
Okay. Hmm.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.643
"For Luke. Love, Uncle Shahir."

01:32.180 --> 01:35.148
Ooh. This...

01:35.150 --> 01:37.717
Oh, you dirty little spud.

01:37.719 --> 01:40.553
Hey, Alex, just letting you know
Luke's got a slight temperature.

01:40.555 --> 01:43.122
Probably just molars coming in,
but nothing to worry about.

01:43.124 --> 01:46.092
In case anybody calls and... Ah! Um... Oh!

01:46.094 --> 01:47.360
Hey.

01:47.362 --> 01:48.728
Someone had their Wheaties this morning.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.698
Um, yeah, breakfast.
Thank you for the reminder.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.032
Uh-huh.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.201
I, uh, I hear your study's moving forward,

01:55.203 --> 01:57.236
your cancer study at Mississauga Memorial.

01:57.238 --> 01:59.872
Yeah, the board thought
after what happened with Bree...

01:59.874 --> 02:01.808
Well, you and Alex got that
study off the ground.

02:01.810 --> 02:03.676
- Don't forget that.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

02:03.678 --> 02:06.145
So I finally found my thing
and then I lost it just as fast.

02:06.147 --> 02:07.680
I miss having a project.

02:07.682 --> 02:10.550
Ooh, I might have something
for you if you're up for it.

02:10.551 --> 02:12.018
Okay.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.553
I need a new chief resident.

02:13.555 --> 02:16.089
Leffering offered Cassie the post but, uh...

02:16.091 --> 02:18.257
Perhaps not an entirely impartial choice.

02:18.259 --> 02:19.993
Yeah, that is a concern.
Dawn's been evaluating them,

02:19.995 --> 02:21.961
but I could use a second opinion.

02:21.963 --> 02:24.197
Ah, yes, feels like only
yesterday Dawn was fixing

02:24.199 --> 02:26.633
that icy blue stare on my every move.

02:26.635 --> 02:28.201
- Mm.
- Ah, wait. That was yesterday.

02:28.203 --> 02:29.869
Dawn's tough, which makes her great.

02:29.871 --> 02:34.374
You... are a great counterpoint
because of your...

02:34.376 --> 02:37.276
Compassion, cheery disposition...

02:37.278 --> 02:38.544
Availability.

02:38.546 --> 02:40.246
Wow, that's validating.

02:40.248 --> 02:41.447
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

02:41.449 --> 02:42.882
Mwah! Thank you, Mags.

02:42.884 --> 02:44.250
Mm-hmm.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.872 --> 03:05.772
The board wants me to stay.

03:05.774 --> 03:08.141
Asked me to finish out my term.

03:08.143 --> 03:09.876
Congratulations.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.577
Then I resigned.

03:11.579 --> 03:12.612
What?

03:12.614 --> 03:13.946
Yeah.

03:15.883 --> 03:19.719
Since he died... Eli King...

03:22.322 --> 03:24.924
I'm not doing so great.

03:27.594 --> 03:30.296
Thomas, there are people here
that can help you with that.

03:30.298 --> 03:32.298
I also asked them to consider
reinstating you

03:32.300 --> 03:34.133
as chief of surgery.

03:34.135 --> 03:35.735
You didn't need to do that.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.438
I told them it was ego
and hubris that got you fired.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.740
Mine.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.076
But things should probably go
back to the way they were

03:43.078 --> 03:45.678
before I got here.

03:52.086 --> 03:53.786
Thank you.

03:53.788 --> 03:56.089
Good luck, Dawn.

04:02.229 --> 04:05.264
Mrs. Crace, I'm happy to hear
that Hope Zion will be

04:05.266 --> 04:07.700
going back to a more familiar
way of doing things.

04:07.702 --> 04:10.870
Dawn, I-I can't reinstate you as chief.

04:10.872 --> 04:12.371
What?

04:12.373 --> 04:14.474
I'm sorry, so much is in flux right now.

04:14.476 --> 04:16.608
We have to stay the course.

04:16.611 --> 04:19.245
Dr. Harris is doing a fine job.

04:19.247 --> 04:20.913
I see.

04:20.915 --> 04:24.016
Uh, we'll, um, post the job
and fill it permanently

04:24.018 --> 04:25.485
in a few months.

04:25.487 --> 04:28.154
We're happy to have you reapply, of course.

04:28.156 --> 04:29.889
- I would be honored.
- Wonderful.

04:29.891 --> 04:31.858
Now, if you'll excuse me.

04:34.228 --> 04:35.895
Up and at 'em.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.597
Okay, good news.

04:37.599 --> 04:39.465
You three lucky contestants
are in the running

04:39.467 --> 04:41.234
for chief resident.

04:41.236 --> 04:43.336
Oh, wait. In the running?

04:43.338 --> 04:45.471
No, no, no, the race is over. I already won.

04:45.473 --> 04:48.107
Oh, yeah. Her, uh,
her boyfriend appointed her.

04:48.109 --> 04:52.211
He's not... I won the job
because I'm the most deserving.

04:52.213 --> 04:54.080
In bed.

04:54.082 --> 04:55.748
That's enough, dude.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.050
Dr. Harris says the post
is still up for grabs, so...

04:58.052 --> 04:59.385
I hear he's single.

04:59.387 --> 05:00.920
Okay, let's focus on the positive.

05:00.922 --> 05:03.689
I'm doing the evaluating, and my motto is,

05:03.691 --> 05:06.826
"Do your best and don't stress."

05:06.828 --> 05:08.661
Incoming.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.634
Hey. Lay off Cassie.

05:14.636 --> 05:16.269
Bro, she ditched you for that suit.

05:16.271 --> 05:17.537
Why you defending her?

05:17.539 --> 05:19.939
Because if she was a guy,
you'd be high-fiving her.

05:19.941 --> 05:21.207
This evaluation is serious.

05:21.209 --> 05:22.842
Lame jokes aren't gonna win you any points.

05:22.844 --> 05:26.112
Au contraire, I think Dr. Lin
enjoys my witty repartee.

05:26.114 --> 05:28.014
Maybe.

05:28.016 --> 05:30.950
But Dr. Bell is evaluating us, too.

05:30.952 --> 05:34.253
And she slapped a resident
in the middle of a surgery.

05:34.255 --> 05:36.189
Yeah, I heard about that in med school.

05:36.191 --> 05:38.224
- It's just folklore.
- No, it was very real.

05:38.226 --> 05:40.493
Resident's name was Lana Davis.

05:40.495 --> 05:42.628
She quit on the spot.
No one's heard from her since.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.730
Okay, now you're just trying
to get in my head.

05:44.732 --> 05:46.933
That's a frightening proposition.

05:49.236 --> 05:51.437
Charlie's got this interim chief
gig for the next few months,

05:51.439 --> 05:53.272
but after that, it's gonna open up again,

05:53.274 --> 05:54.974
which means... sign here and here...

05:54.976 --> 05:56.809
which means that you have a few months

05:56.811 --> 05:58.578
to convince the board that
you're their best bet.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.012
How am I gonna do that?

06:00.014 --> 06:01.814
You can, uh, come up
with a mission statement

06:01.816 --> 06:03.783
and get some recommendation letters

06:03.785 --> 06:05.785
from your heavy-hitting peers.

06:05.787 --> 06:07.887
You wanna be my campaign manager?

06:07.889 --> 06:10.790
Well, in the 12th grade, I did
help Marty McGuire

06:10.792 --> 06:13.025
sweep student council,
and he had a lazy eye,

06:13.027 --> 06:15.328
whereas you have beautiful eyes.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.396
Okay, your point.

06:17.398 --> 06:18.598
What's first?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.801
Well, rule number one, be nice.

06:21.803 --> 06:23.436
It's better to be feared than loved.

06:23.438 --> 06:27.273
Uh-huh. Just be yourself, but nicer.

06:27.275 --> 06:28.741
Like you are with me.

06:30.244 --> 06:32.945
Good morning.

06:32.947 --> 06:34.847
Dr. Lin.

06:34.849 --> 06:36.749
Good morning. How are you?

06:36.751 --> 06:38.384
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.

06:38.386 --> 06:41.153
I'm just, uh, evaluating
the residents today.

06:41.155 --> 06:43.489
Well, I can't think of
a better person for the job.

06:43.491 --> 06:44.857
You are in good hands.

06:49.963 --> 06:51.497
- How was that?
- That was good.

06:51.499 --> 06:52.999
I mean, you don't want to peak too soon.

06:53.001 --> 06:54.700
That was really good.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.235
Welcome to the freshly restored ER

06:56.237 --> 06:58.004
and our brand-new Leave No Trace policy,

06:58.006 --> 06:59.672
which means whatever you bring in

06:59.674 --> 07:03.142
must go with you when you leave,
if you catch my drift, Dr. Lin.

07:03.144 --> 07:04.744
Okay, they're with me all day.

07:04.746 --> 07:06.846
- They're being evaluated for chief res.
- Hmm.

07:06.848 --> 07:08.381
One false move and...

07:09.851 --> 07:12.752
- Ignore him.
- Incoming!

07:12.754 --> 07:14.253
We saw pulsatile bleeding at the scene.

07:14.255 --> 07:15.788
He's had 20 mikes of fentanyl.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.723
Okay, we got two beds coming
and you take this one.

07:17.725 --> 07:20.860
Okay, that is arterial blood.
Carotid is cut.

07:20.862 --> 07:22.528
Okay, gauze and pressure.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.697
- Sir, can you hear me?
- He was talking at the scene.

07:24.699 --> 07:26.399
- - Okay.
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

07:26.401 --> 07:27.900
That's a good sign.

07:27.902 --> 07:29.869
That means his brain is still perfused.

07:29.871 --> 07:31.137
Is that a knife?

07:31.139 --> 07:34.173
No, if I know my ancient weaponry,

07:34.175 --> 07:36.008
that's a ninja throwing star.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.381
- I'm getting a weird sound.
- Weird how?

07:49.383 --> 07:50.715
Like Rice Krispies.

07:50.717 --> 07:52.651
Dr. Lin, he's got bubbles.

07:52.653 --> 07:53.919
Bubbles and Rice Krispies.

07:53.921 --> 07:55.287
This guy should do kids' parties.

07:55.289 --> 07:56.555
Diagnosis?

07:56.557 --> 07:58.823
Subcutaneous emphysema.
Air trapped under the skin.

07:58.825 --> 08:00.392
- Very good.
- There's a rupture in his airway

08:00.394 --> 08:02.294
somewhere between the trachea
and the lung parenchyma.

08:02.296 --> 08:04.496
Also correct. This is not good
for our patient.

08:04.498 --> 08:05.897
What was he doing? Playing ninja?

08:05.899 --> 08:07.499
We were at the Ninja Binja.

08:07.501 --> 08:10.635
It's like drop-in training for ninjas.

08:10.637 --> 08:13.171
And everything was going fine
until this idiot

08:13.173 --> 08:14.506
- bounced a ninja star...
- Sammy...

08:14.508 --> 08:15.874
- Hey, hey, don't move!
- His air is compromised.

08:15.876 --> 08:17.509
He can't breathe. He can't breathe.

08:17.511 --> 08:19.177
I wanna help him. I wanna be in there.

08:19.179 --> 08:21.079
I know. That's okay. We got him.
Now what's your name?

08:21.081 --> 08:23.315
- Samuel.
- Samuel? Just wait here.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.659
- What do we got?
- A man in cubicle 2,

08:34.660 --> 08:36.094
broke his fall on a glass table.

08:36.096 --> 08:37.462
Guy's hand is pretty banged up.

08:37.464 --> 08:39.130
- Oh, FOOSH injury. You need ortho.
- And plastics.

08:39.131 --> 08:40.732
No way. I've been on trauma call all night.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.167
And I don't do plastics anymore.

08:42.169 --> 08:44.068
Dr. Harris says that you do,
and I just follow orders.

08:44.071 --> 08:45.770
So bed... 2.

08:51.278 --> 08:54.012
Whoa. Let's keep it G-rated, shall we?

08:54.014 --> 08:55.947
I'm Dr. Kinney, and you must be...

08:55.949 --> 08:59.351
Just call me Mario.
And this is, uh, Claudia.

08:59.353 --> 09:00.819
I don't...

09:00.821 --> 09:02.520
I know what it says on the chart, but, um,

09:02.522 --> 09:06.091
- please, just call me Mario.
- Okay. Mario.

09:06.093 --> 09:07.592
Let's look at that hand, shall we?

09:08.928 --> 09:10.328
- Mm.
- Can you feel that?

09:10.330 --> 09:12.130
Yeah, a lot, actually.
Mm-hmm.

09:12.132 --> 09:14.165
I knew we shouldn't have had dinner in bed.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.901
Never got out of bed.
We had to eat sometime.

09:16.903 --> 09:18.937
It was all fine until I started choking.

09:18.939 --> 09:22.240
I went for the phone. I got
tangled up in the sheets.

09:22.242 --> 09:24.476
Fell out of bed, put my hand out
to break my fall.

09:24.478 --> 09:26.278
Yeah, well, you've definitely
broken something.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.980
I'll need an X-ray to confirm.
But look at the bright side,

09:28.982 --> 09:30.882
you got a hell of a story
to tell about your honeymoon.

09:30.884 --> 09:33.051
Oh, uh, we're not married.

09:33.053 --> 09:34.552
Oh, sorry. Just assumed.

09:34.554 --> 09:36.054
Wild nights, dinners in bed, you know,

09:36.056 --> 09:37.422
thought you were newlyweds.

09:37.424 --> 09:39.057
- We're kind of the opposite, actually.
- Uh-huh.

09:39.059 --> 09:40.358
We don't even know each other's name.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.660
And we never will.

09:43.696 --> 09:46.364
That one goes... here.

09:48.101 --> 09:49.868
Where's... oh, shoot. This one is...

09:49.870 --> 09:51.636
Jonathan.

09:51.638 --> 09:54.072
I know. I know, I know, I know.
I'm obsessing.

09:54.074 --> 09:55.607
That's one of your best qualities.

09:55.609 --> 09:57.175
You care about the details.

09:57.177 --> 09:59.010
Can you remind me again
why I quit my finance job

09:59.012 --> 10:00.545
to sell homemade cookies?

10:00.547 --> 10:02.180
Well, you said you were
following your bliss.

10:02.182 --> 10:04.182
Yeah, I just wish my bliss paid better.

10:04.184 --> 10:07.085
- I really need to make a sale.
- I think you'll make one day.

10:08.321 --> 10:09.721
You must be Jonathan.

10:09.723 --> 10:12.023
I've heard so much about you. Dawn Bell.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.525
I've heard a lot about you, too.

10:15.361 --> 10:18.697
Look at these marvelous confections.

10:18.699 --> 10:21.166
- Did you make these?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

10:21.168 --> 10:24.069
It's millet with carob and goji berries.

10:24.071 --> 10:25.870
Yes. Jonathan has a meeting with the head

10:25.872 --> 10:27.272
of Food and Beverages.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.973
We're hoping he can sell these
cookies in the hospital.

10:28.975 --> 10:30.742
I have been saying for years
that this hospital

10:30.744 --> 10:32.911
needs to serve healthier snacks.

10:32.913 --> 10:34.579
I never heard you say that.

10:34.581 --> 10:37.482
I'll tell you what.
You sell me some samples,

10:37.484 --> 10:39.918
and then tell Food and Beverage
that it has been endorsed

10:39.920 --> 10:42.053
as a healthy by
the Chief of Cardiac Surgery.

10:42.055 --> 10:44.055
Amazing. Thank you.

10:44.057 --> 10:47.459
Uh, so, uh, a dozen is $48.

10:47.461 --> 10:51.463
So two dozen is 96 bucks.

10:53.232 --> 10:55.467
That... that's great.

10:55.469 --> 10:57.836
Uh, as soon as I can change
my clothes, I'm good for it.
Mnh.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.404
That's very kind of you.

10:59.406 --> 11:02.040
I am happy to help.

11:02.042 --> 11:03.975
- Oh, Shahir.
- Hmm?

11:03.977 --> 11:05.877
Since I have you, uh,

11:05.879 --> 11:08.480
I'd like you to consider
writing a letter to the board

11:08.482 --> 11:10.382
endorsing me for the next chief posting.

11:11.784 --> 11:14.619
I think that sounds like a fair deal.

11:14.621 --> 11:17.389
Hmm? Okay?

11:17.391 --> 11:19.324
Right.

11:19.326 --> 11:22.160
Thank you, Shahir. Thank you.

11:22.162 --> 11:24.562
Your cookies.

11:35.275 --> 11:36.975
- Hey!
- Hey.

11:36.977 --> 11:38.476
He looks flushed.

11:38.478 --> 11:40.445
- Is he febrile?
- No, his temperature's normal.

11:40.447 --> 11:42.881
Just need to go for a little
spin to calm him down.

11:42.883 --> 11:44.749
- Okay, that's good.
- You're such a worrier.

11:44.751 --> 11:46.284
You know, you get that from your mother.

11:46.286 --> 11:47.952
And of course they're calling me to the ER.

11:47.954 --> 11:49.320
Do you guys mind, uh...

11:49.322 --> 11:50.922
- Are you kidding? We'd love to.
- Thank you.

11:50.924 --> 11:53.057
Actually, you know, I have
a consult in five minutes.

11:53.059 --> 11:54.793
Go, go, go, go, go. Heal the world.

11:54.795 --> 11:56.261
Hey, Lukey, you want a cookie?

11:56.263 --> 11:58.029
You know, why don't I hold on
to these cookies

11:58.031 --> 11:59.898
- while you take care of Luke?
- Don't be silly.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.499
I'll leave them in your office
until the meeting.

12:01.501 --> 12:04.302
And stop worrying.
You're gonna get wrinkles.

12:04.304 --> 12:07.572
Wanna get in some trouble,
buddy? Let's do this.

12:07.574 --> 12:09.307
Let's do this!

12:09.309 --> 12:11.209
No evidence of nerve or tendon damage.

12:11.211 --> 12:12.343
Clean colles fracture.

12:12.345 --> 12:13.912
So no need for plastics, which is good,

12:13.914 --> 12:15.213
because I don't do that anymore.

12:15.215 --> 12:16.614
Look, I'm trying to hire someone new,

12:16.616 --> 12:18.383
but until I do, I need to know
I can still count on you.

12:18.385 --> 12:20.118
It's not easy being so wonderful, you know?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.853
Sleeplessness does become you.

12:21.855 --> 12:23.822
Hello, I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Harris,

12:23.824 --> 12:25.957
- Mr., um...
- Uh, call me Mario.

12:29.228 --> 12:30.962
Okay. Mario.

12:30.964 --> 12:33.298
Um, you have a fracture
of the distal radius.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.899
So you're gonna need a lot of help

12:34.901 --> 12:36.935
for the next six to eight weeks.
I take it that would be you.

12:36.937 --> 12:38.937
Me? No, no. That's not... no.

12:38.939 --> 12:41.406
It's not part of our deal.

12:41.408 --> 12:43.842
Okay, well, you may want to
renegotiate those terms

12:43.844 --> 12:45.977
'cause that hand's gonna be
completely immobilized.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.846
I'll manage.

12:47.848 --> 12:49.781
Uh, you should go.

12:49.783 --> 12:51.216
Wait, wait. You're just gonna leave?

12:51.218 --> 12:52.984
Well, I have to. That's part of our...

12:52.986 --> 12:54.352
Deal. Right. You said.

12:54.354 --> 12:56.054
- You're my heart.
- And you're mine.

12:56.056 --> 12:58.289
Till next year. Ti amo.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.895
So, uh, what happens next year?

13:03.897 --> 13:06.431
We... do it all over again.

13:07.566 --> 13:09.267
Uh, well, not all of it.

13:12.906 --> 13:14.372
Is my dad okay?

13:14.374 --> 13:16.541
We're doing
everything we can for him.

13:16.543 --> 13:18.877
We do need a signed consent
before we take him into the OR.

13:18.879 --> 13:21.546
- Is your mom around?
- She passed away.

13:21.548 --> 13:23.648
It needs to be someone over 18.

13:23.650 --> 13:26.351
I mean, we only moved here
a couple months ago.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.353
It's been just the two of us.

13:28.355 --> 13:30.255
You and your dad must be pretty close.

13:30.257 --> 13:33.858
Yeah, we are. Since my mom died.

13:33.860 --> 13:36.794
We've gone ziplining, swam with sharks.

13:36.796 --> 13:39.230
You guys are gonna operate
anyway, though, right?

13:39.232 --> 13:41.332
Of course. Not to worry.

13:41.334 --> 13:43.434
I'm not. He'll be fine.

13:43.436 --> 13:46.004
He's the strongest person in the world.

13:48.207 --> 13:49.941
Okay, just relax your wrist for me.

13:51.945 --> 13:53.745
Everything feels so heavy.

13:53.747 --> 13:57.081
Listen, I know this is
none of my business, but, um,

13:57.083 --> 14:00.018
I do recognize the look
of someone who knows the, um,

14:00.020 --> 14:02.520
best thing in his life
just walked out the door.

14:02.522 --> 14:04.656
What am I supposed to do about it?

14:04.658 --> 14:06.024
Feelings weren't part of the...

14:06.026 --> 14:09.160
Deal, yeah. You, uh, you keep saying that.

14:12.131 --> 14:16.634
I met Claudia, um,
at a conference three years ago.

14:16.636 --> 14:20.071
And it was like, boom. Best week of my life.

14:20.073 --> 14:22.273
So we did it again the next year
and the next.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.143
We never talked about our real lives.

14:25.145 --> 14:27.946
We got to know each other
from the inside out.

14:27.948 --> 14:30.181
Only the craziest thing happened.

14:30.183 --> 14:32.317
You fell in love?

14:34.521 --> 14:37.121
I never planned it, but I, uh...

14:39.124 --> 14:41.125
just couldn't stop it
from happening, you know?

14:42.194 --> 14:44.162
How come you never told me?

14:44.164 --> 14:47.832
Okay, I'm gonna, uh, leave the two of you

14:47.834 --> 14:49.801
to sort this out.

14:49.803 --> 14:51.669
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah?

14:51.671 --> 14:53.004
If you're gonna bail on me,

14:53.006 --> 14:54.639
you could at least look me in the eye.

15:02.181 --> 15:04.983
Will you excuse me for a minute?

15:12.224 --> 15:14.058
We weren't supposed to
fall in love.

15:14.060 --> 15:15.493
How could he do this?

15:15.495 --> 15:19.130
Claudia, I think you might have
bigger problems right now.

15:19.132 --> 15:21.032
Which way did you come from?

15:21.034 --> 15:23.868
I don't...

15:23.870 --> 15:26.638
Back there.

15:39.551 --> 15:42.053
You all right, Dr. Harris?

15:42.055 --> 15:44.422
We need a doctor!

15:46.125 --> 15:48.226
Call a code team now!

15:57.267 --> 15:59.534
Claudia? Claudia, can you hear me?

15:59.536 --> 16:02.571
- Yes, yes. Say yes.
- How do you know this person?

16:02.573 --> 16:03.939
Uh, she came in with a patient of mine.

16:03.941 --> 16:05.307
Carotid's a little thready.

16:05.309 --> 16:07.209
This is my fault.
It's my punishment.

16:07.211 --> 16:09.010
Okay, we gotta get an IV in her right away.

16:09.012 --> 16:10.746
- Let's get her to the IR.
- Am I gonna die?

16:10.748 --> 16:12.347
She needs triage. ER's her best bet.

16:12.349 --> 16:14.316
She needs a gastroscope. Right down here.

16:14.318 --> 16:16.385
Okay. IR it is. Let's go, guys. Let's move.

16:16.387 --> 16:19.488
Please, don't let me
die like this!

16:19.490 --> 16:23.258
A fortifying pre-operative treat
for all that you do.

16:24.727 --> 16:27.329
Dr. Bell, I'm taking the residents in

16:27.331 --> 16:29.431
on a suspected tear of the carotid artery.

16:29.433 --> 16:32.768
Could be a simple suture, or it
could be a PTFE graft repair.

16:32.770 --> 16:35.570
Okay.

16:35.572 --> 16:39.141
That is a perfect procedure
for an evaluation.

16:39.143 --> 16:41.309
What the hell? I'm gonna join you.

16:41.311 --> 16:42.511
Oh.

16:42.513 --> 16:44.980
Don't worry, Dr. Scott. I will not slap you.

16:46.616 --> 16:48.150
Unless, of course, you screw up.

16:48.152 --> 16:49.317
What's the occasion?

16:49.319 --> 16:51.853
I'm just giving back to my staff

16:51.855 --> 16:54.122
who has given me so much.

16:54.124 --> 16:56.458
You want your old job back, don't you?

16:56.460 --> 16:58.894
I do.

16:58.896 --> 17:02.531
Our former CEO finally saw
the error in his ways.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.899
Sorry. Former?

17:03.901 --> 17:06.334
Thomas resigned this morning.

17:06.336 --> 17:08.236
Obviously, he hasn't told you.

17:08.238 --> 17:09.871
Doesn't matter.

17:09.873 --> 17:11.673
I need to focus on the surgery.

17:11.675 --> 17:12.941
Good.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.820
Yo, Samuel. You lost?

17:25.823 --> 17:27.321
I wanted to see the operation.

17:27.324 --> 17:28.723
Oh, no, man. You're not allowed.

17:28.725 --> 17:30.225
Only staff are supposed to be here.

17:30.227 --> 17:32.093
Um, are you his doctor?

17:32.095 --> 17:33.929
Yeah, I'm one of them.

17:33.931 --> 17:36.565
Dude, your dad's got
a great team looking after him.

17:36.567 --> 17:38.200
Is he gonna be okay?

17:38.202 --> 17:40.669
Hey, look at this face.

17:40.671 --> 17:42.637
Does this look like the face
of a nervous man to you?

17:42.639 --> 17:44.039
Mm, I guess not.

17:44.041 --> 17:46.174
No, that's right. Now come on.

17:46.176 --> 17:47.876
Waiting room's at the end of the hall.

17:47.878 --> 17:49.444
I'll come get you
as soon as we're done.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.379
Okay. Thank you.

18:27.283 --> 18:30.085
Um, why don't the men's washrooms

18:30.087 --> 18:31.553
have diaper stations?

18:31.555 --> 18:32.787
Huh.

18:32.789 --> 18:34.189
We should talk to Charlie about that.

18:34.191 --> 18:35.657
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Okay.

18:35.659 --> 18:36.958
- Here. You better go.
- Great. Yes.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.293
You'll be late to your pitch.

18:38.295 --> 18:39.794
Listen, I gave him a cookie,
but he barely ate it.

18:39.796 --> 18:41.129
Maybe he really is sick.

18:41.131 --> 18:42.664
He's probably just not hungry.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.966
- Um, wish me luck.
- Yes. Good luck.

18:44.968 --> 18:46.268
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:50.307 --> 18:52.707
It's okay. I saved you one of the good ones.

18:57.146 --> 18:59.314
Dr. Williams, continue through prep.

18:59.316 --> 19:01.283
As the neck is
our area of concern...

19:01.285 --> 19:03.118
Suboptimal. Anyone else?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.819
With the subcutaneous emphysema,

19:04.821 --> 19:06.321
we should prep the chest, too.

19:06.323 --> 19:07.689
Good, Sekara. Go ahead.

19:07.691 --> 19:09.324
We need to keep our options open.

19:09.326 --> 19:10.926
Okay, then we'll make
cuts above and below...

19:10.928 --> 19:13.194
No pointing. Verbally describe.

19:13.196 --> 19:15.730
Uh, yeah, we would do a...

19:15.732 --> 19:17.098
Follow the anterior border

19:17.100 --> 19:18.934
of the sternocleidomastoid.

19:18.936 --> 19:20.569
And curve medially towards the midline

19:20.571 --> 19:21.970
in case we have to do a sternotomy.

19:21.972 --> 19:24.205
Right on. And the arterial repair?

19:24.207 --> 19:26.007
Uh, homologous graft would be best.

19:26.009 --> 19:28.610
And barring a simple
suture closure, uh,

19:28.612 --> 19:31.846
from where would we harvest
the autologous graft, Dr. Scott?

19:31.848 --> 19:36.051
Uh, yeah, we probably...
best bet would be...

19:36.053 --> 19:38.587
While you're thinking it over,
this man goes brain-dead.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.555
- Anyone else?
- The saphenous vein.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.223
So we also need to prep the leg.

19:42.225 --> 19:44.426
Nothing motivates
like the fear of failure.

19:44.428 --> 19:47.228
Well, whoever's up,
the patient's good to go.

19:47.230 --> 19:48.730
Who'd like to do the honors?

19:48.732 --> 19:51.266
- - Sekara.
- Scalpel.

19:51.268 --> 19:53.635
Dr. Bell?

19:53.637 --> 19:56.004
You're wanted in interventional radiology.

19:57.039 --> 19:58.740
Carry on.

19:58.742 --> 20:00.909
Would you like to help
finish evaluating later?

20:00.911 --> 20:02.844
Oh, no. I've seen enough.

20:02.846 --> 20:05.714
Well, I'm screwed.

20:05.716 --> 20:07.015
You're not the only one.

20:07.017 --> 20:08.984
Dr. Bell is tough,
but it's not personal.

20:08.986 --> 20:10.285
It's just the way she learned.

20:10.287 --> 20:12.721
Old school. All stick. No carrot.

20:12.723 --> 20:15.123
It's a method, but
I don't think it's the only one.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.192
Remember, I'm evaluating you, too.

20:17.194 --> 20:19.794
Millennials. So sensitive.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.865
All right, there it is.
Right in the esophagus.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.367
Could be a mycotic aneurysm.

20:25.369 --> 20:27.669
Must have aortoesophageal fistula.

20:27.671 --> 20:29.771
This the woman that was vomiting
blood in the elevator?

20:29.773 --> 20:31.840
Yeah, esophageal,
we ruled out liver disease.

20:31.842 --> 20:33.041
I'm holding the bleed with a scope,

20:33.043 --> 20:34.209
but I can't do it for much longer.

20:34.211 --> 20:35.910
She's losing volume fast.

20:35.912 --> 20:38.546
Okay, she's going into v-tack.
She needs a CVP line.

20:38.548 --> 20:41.282
Pump those bags. Dr. Kinney,
she needs more volume.

20:41.284 --> 20:43.985
- What do we know about her?
- She was choking on her dinner last night.

20:43.987 --> 20:46.221
- Didn't say what she ate.
- We had fish.

20:47.556 --> 20:49.024
It's an aphrodisiac.

20:51.527 --> 20:53.361
It's a fishbone.

20:53.363 --> 20:55.263
You sure?

20:55.265 --> 20:56.831
Yep. 100%.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.000
Okay, well, clear an OR,
because if it's a fishbone

20:59.002 --> 21:01.069
and it gets into her aorta, she's dead.

21:01.071 --> 21:03.304
Let's move.

21:06.091 --> 21:07.325
She's already fistulized.

21:07.327 --> 21:08.659
There may be nothing else we can do.

21:08.661 --> 21:09.927
Okay, well, if it's a sentinel bleed,

21:09.929 --> 21:11.195
then the worst is around the corner.

21:11.197 --> 21:12.463
I'll put a stent in, but it's only...

21:12.465 --> 21:14.198
No, that wouldn't give her
more than a few months.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.833
Her only chance is a thoracotomy.

21:15.835 --> 21:18.069
And even that is a long shot.

21:18.071 --> 21:20.605
All from a damn fishbone, huh?

21:20.607 --> 21:22.173
I'll handle the esophagus.

21:22.175 --> 21:23.708
Okay, I'm gonna bring in Dr. Kinney.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.576
I'll go see if I can get a more
extensive medical history.

21:25.578 --> 21:27.845
- I'm surprised you don't already have one.
- What?

21:27.847 --> 21:30.214
It's just that you always seem
to have this information

21:30.216 --> 21:31.983
that no one else does, you know?

21:31.985 --> 21:34.185
It's like your super power?

21:39.924 --> 21:42.393
Yeah, one more time.

21:42.395 --> 21:43.827
Yeah.

21:43.829 --> 21:46.864
Sorry, that, uh, went a little
longer than I thought.

21:46.866 --> 21:48.265
Mm-hmm.

21:48.267 --> 21:51.301
Uh, I need to talk to you about something.

21:51.303 --> 21:54.204
Um, you know, they're holding an OR for me.

21:54.206 --> 21:56.073
How did the meeting go?

21:56.075 --> 21:58.041
Uh... Well...

21:58.043 --> 22:01.078
Oh, it went well. That's good.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.247
Yeah, they liked the cookies.

22:03.249 --> 22:04.782
Excellent. That is excellent.

22:04.784 --> 22:07.918
I wanna hear all the details
when I come out of surgery.

22:11.190 --> 22:13.357
Hey, Doc, so am I good to go now or what?

22:13.359 --> 22:15.325
Uh, no, you need to stick around
for one more X-ray.

22:15.327 --> 22:19.363
But, Mario, you should know that
we just admitted Claudia.

22:19.365 --> 22:21.198
What... why? What happened?

22:21.200 --> 22:23.333
Um, it turns out last night

22:23.335 --> 22:24.968
when she was choking on something,

22:24.970 --> 22:26.837
that it was a fishbone, and it got lodged

22:26.839 --> 22:29.173
in her throat, causing quite a nasty tear.

22:29.175 --> 22:30.641
Is she okay?

22:30.643 --> 22:32.342
We hope so, but we need
to find out something

22:32.344 --> 22:33.844
about her medical history.

22:33.846 --> 22:35.813
I told you, I don't even know her.

22:35.815 --> 22:38.415
I don't know anything about her.

22:38.417 --> 22:40.250
This is a disaster.

22:40.252 --> 22:42.119
Dr. Harris.

22:42.121 --> 22:43.987
The woman with the fishbone, I was told

22:43.989 --> 22:45.789
you're the surgeon to consult
while she's in surgery?

22:45.791 --> 22:48.826
Uh, yeah. Do you have a question, Taylor?

22:48.828 --> 22:50.961
No, but, uh, her husband does.

22:50.963 --> 22:53.564
Dr. Harris, this is Derek Adams.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.371
I don't know what's worse,

23:01.373 --> 23:03.640
that my wife choked on
a fishbone that might kill her,

23:03.642 --> 23:07.578
or that she was in bed with
another man when it happened.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.513
When can I see her?

23:09.515 --> 23:11.648
Uh, it's gonna be a few hours.

23:11.650 --> 23:16.253
But, um, until then, I'm gonna
need as much information

23:16.255 --> 23:18.155
about her as I can get.

23:18.157 --> 23:20.224
Well, first of all, her name's Claudine.

23:20.226 --> 23:23.093
She always thought that
"Claudia" was sexier.

23:23.095 --> 23:24.928
You know, I met her in a hospital.

23:24.930 --> 23:27.331
She was doing some volunteer
work and I'd gotten mugged

23:27.333 --> 23:28.966
on my way home from the library.

23:28.968 --> 23:31.168
Three stitches and a broken nose.

23:31.170 --> 23:36.340
And when I saw her, I said,
"Derek, that is the one."

23:37.575 --> 23:39.710
You married?

23:39.712 --> 23:41.245
No.

23:41.247 --> 23:43.447
Maybe for the best.

23:43.449 --> 23:45.916
You could've been sitting here
the cuckolded fool.

23:45.918 --> 23:47.384
You're not a fool, Derek.

23:47.386 --> 23:49.786
But I am. You wanna know why?

23:49.788 --> 23:52.289
Because I don't care about the other guy.

23:52.291 --> 23:55.425
I just want her to be okay.

23:55.427 --> 23:57.194
I need to see her again.

23:57.196 --> 23:59.429
That doesn't make you a fool either.

24:01.967 --> 24:05.836
Oh, I, uh, I brought this.

24:05.838 --> 24:07.437
It's hers.

24:07.439 --> 24:09.706
I always carry around a spare.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.875
She's a bit of a scatterbrain.

24:11.877 --> 24:13.477
Thank you.

24:13.479 --> 24:15.312
I'll, um...

24:15.314 --> 24:17.681
I'll let you know when
there's something to report.

24:30.662 --> 24:34.164
Roxy, it is hard to
work with all that noise.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.466
I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr. Palmer,

24:36.468 --> 24:38.435
but something's going on.

24:38.437 --> 24:39.903
She's having a reaction.

24:39.905 --> 24:42.573
She has asthma, so be on
the look out for bronchospasm.

24:44.576 --> 24:45.909
Is that it there?

24:50.148 --> 24:51.782
Fishbone.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.018
Just like the man said. Uncanny.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.587
How's she doing now, Roxy?

24:56.589 --> 24:58.522
Airway pressure's stabilized.

24:58.524 --> 25:00.490
The bone perforated the esophageal wall.

25:00.492 --> 25:02.326
I can't make any predictions
until I get a look at

25:02.328 --> 25:04.027
the aortoesophageal fistula.

25:04.029 --> 25:05.696
I'm done in the chest.
Fill your boots, guys.

25:05.698 --> 25:07.998
I'm gonna leave you to it, then.

25:09.702 --> 25:11.268
He's gonna leave us to it
until the next time

25:11.270 --> 25:12.736
he comes back with another random tidbit

25:12.738 --> 25:13.937
of mysterious information, right?

25:13.939 --> 25:15.205
The guy's like Scooby Doo, am I right?

25:15.207 --> 25:16.740
Hey, when you're chief of surgery,

25:16.742 --> 25:18.108
you get to be weird, okay?

25:18.110 --> 25:19.676
Just ask Dr. Bell.

25:22.547 --> 25:24.481
How's it going with those
vessie loops, Dr. Williams?

25:24.483 --> 25:25.949
I've got the artery clamped.

25:25.951 --> 25:28.118
Okay, now it should be safe
to remove that star thingy.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.553
This might be a stupid question.

25:29.555 --> 25:32.322
- - No such thing. Go ahead.
- How do we do that?

25:32.324 --> 25:35.258
Well, it's not lodged
in the jaw or the spine.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.526
It should come right out.

25:36.528 --> 25:38.228
Do you know how sharp those things are?

25:38.230 --> 25:40.831
- Ninjas used them to kill people.
- I know that.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.566
I'm just saying.
Trachea's already injured.

25:42.568 --> 25:44.668
If we nick the esophagus,
it'll be a disaster.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.136
Okay, focus, people.

25:46.138 --> 25:47.704
Yeah, it comes right out.

25:51.543 --> 25:52.976
Step back.
I need to find this bleed.

25:52.978 --> 25:54.911
Quickly, Lin. SATs are dropping.

25:56.828 --> 25:57.863
Is it the jugular vein?

25:57.863 --> 25:58.920
You ripped it to shreds
tearing it out like that.

25:58.920 --> 25:59.996
What were you thinking?

25:59.996 --> 26:01.776
I thought you said
we could safely remove it.

26:01.776 --> 26:03.583
I didn't say to do it now, did I?

26:03.583 --> 26:05.912
Okay, you didn't cut the vein.
The jugular's already injured.

26:05.914 --> 26:07.180
The artery shouldn't be
clamped off like that.

26:07.182 --> 26:08.781
- I can tie the jugular.
- Okay, do it.

26:08.783 --> 26:09.883
Right AO?

26:09.885 --> 26:11.317
Dr. Lin, I don't like his BP.

26:14.797 --> 26:17.390
- Dr. Williams?
- Hold on.

26:18.626 --> 26:20.159
Cassie?

26:20.161 --> 26:23.196
It's tied off. That's it. I think.

26:23.198 --> 26:24.731
- Is that it?
- Well, the bleeding's stopped.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.266
Dr. Sharpe?

26:28.270 --> 26:31.070
BP rising. He's stable.

26:31.072 --> 26:33.706
Okay, hell of a lesson plan, Dr. Lin.

26:39.647 --> 26:42.248
Thought I might find you in here.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.451
Masked strangers cutting
my body open.

26:45.453 --> 26:48.288
I wouldn't miss it.

26:48.290 --> 26:51.524
You must think I'm a terrible
person after what I did.

26:51.526 --> 26:55.728
I don't, but doesn't really
matter what I think.

26:55.730 --> 26:58.197
Matters what you think.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.967
You know that woman
you met in the emergency room?

27:00.969 --> 27:02.268
Claudia?

27:02.270 --> 27:05.405
She's wild and reckless

27:05.407 --> 27:07.540
and doesn't give a hoot
what anyone thinks.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.709
She also wouldn't
use the word "hoot."

27:09.711 --> 27:13.279
But me, I do. I just did.

27:14.682 --> 27:16.816
Maybe your time with Mario's more about you

27:16.818 --> 27:19.185
than it is about him.

27:20.387 --> 27:22.455
With Mario, I...

27:22.457 --> 27:24.757
I get to be messy.

27:24.759 --> 27:28.695
He surprises me,
but most importantly,

27:28.697 --> 27:30.663
I surprise myself.

27:31.999 --> 27:33.866
After 10 years of marriage,

27:33.868 --> 27:35.768
Derek doesn't surprise you anymore?

27:35.770 --> 27:38.604
He supports me, he hears me,

27:38.606 --> 27:42.008
but... no.

27:42.010 --> 27:43.776
No surprises.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.047
Have you told him that?

27:52.988 --> 27:54.487
- Nice suture.
- Hmm.

27:54.489 --> 27:57.590
- How we doing, Roxy?
- A-one, Dr. Bell. She's stable.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.325
Okay.

27:59.327 --> 28:01.194
Removing the clamps.

28:12.474 --> 28:14.173
So you're gonna throw
your hat in the ring for chief

28:14.175 --> 28:15.475
when the time comes, huh?

28:15.477 --> 28:17.110
Uh, I will be.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.512
And I'll be looking for letters of support

28:19.514 --> 28:21.547
written by my most esteemed peers.

28:21.549 --> 28:23.349
Go on.

28:23.351 --> 28:25.251
You know, if you wanna beat Dr. Harris,

28:25.253 --> 28:27.987
you could just let everyone know
what a nut job he is.

28:31.325 --> 28:34.193
I thought we were gonna lose him.

28:34.195 --> 28:37.230
The key is to stay a few steps ahead. Chess.

28:37.232 --> 28:39.499
I never liked chess.

28:39.501 --> 28:42.335
Always overidentified with the pawns.

28:42.337 --> 28:44.904
Plodding along one square at a time.

28:44.906 --> 28:47.840
Well, then just think of it
as a super intense

28:47.842 --> 28:50.710
- life-or-death game of Dungeons & Dragons.
- Hmm.

28:50.712 --> 28:52.712
So, like, every game of D&D.

29:02.456 --> 29:04.223
You know, Billy almost just killed that guy

29:04.225 --> 29:05.992
and somehow he's still in
the running for chief resident.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.393
Hey, we saved our patient.

29:07.395 --> 29:08.694
Today's not all bad.

29:08.696 --> 29:10.129
You know, there shouldn't even be a race.

29:10.131 --> 29:11.330
I was promised something

29:11.332 --> 29:13.099
and it was immediately taken away from me.

29:13.101 --> 29:14.934
Cassie.

29:14.936 --> 29:16.502
Cassie.

29:16.504 --> 29:19.072
I agree.

29:19.074 --> 29:20.740
Go tell someone who matters.

29:30.818 --> 29:32.185
You matter, Dev.

29:39.727 --> 29:41.294
Radiology, code seven.

29:42.831 --> 29:45.198
You guys are smiling. That's good, right?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.766
Your dad's gonna be fine.

29:46.768 --> 29:48.234
He's gonna need some time, though.

29:48.236 --> 29:49.469
He's gonna need a lot of help.

29:49.471 --> 29:51.737
Yeah, I'm gonna put some
handrails in the shower,

29:51.739 --> 29:53.339
move his bed to the main floor.

29:53.341 --> 29:54.540
It'll be more than that.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.808
There'll be medications to remember...

29:55.810 --> 29:58.444
Oh, yeah. No problem. I got that. Done.

29:58.446 --> 30:00.413
Just tell me... what you need.

30:00.415 --> 30:02.648
You shouldn't have to. You're a kid.

30:02.650 --> 30:04.517
Let's find you some help.

30:04.519 --> 30:09.255
When my mom died, we said
we'd look after each other.

30:09.257 --> 30:11.991
He spends all his time with me.

30:11.993 --> 30:14.227
Gave up everything.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.462
He's really there for you.

30:16.464 --> 30:21.134
I just... I wanna show him that
I can be there for him, too.

30:21.136 --> 30:23.136
That I'm strong enough.

30:23.138 --> 30:24.837
I'm sure he knows that.

30:24.839 --> 30:29.008
You know, there's strength
in knowing your limits.

30:29.010 --> 30:33.179
I know you're scared, even
if you got your game face on.

30:33.181 --> 30:34.747
And you both have needs.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.250
It doesn't help your dad
to pretend you don't.

30:39.353 --> 30:42.855
Dr. Scott, why don't you show
Samuel to his father?

30:42.857 --> 30:44.957
Yeah. Come on.

30:48.996 --> 30:51.397
Cassie. Does that look straight to you?

30:51.399 --> 30:53.065
I know what you think, Dr. Bell.

30:53.067 --> 30:55.501
You think I flirted my way to the top.

30:55.503 --> 30:57.336
Did you?

30:57.338 --> 30:59.839
I covered call every other night
and I studied my ass off

30:59.841 --> 31:01.507
and you barely noticed.

31:01.509 --> 31:05.778
So when Thomas came around and did...

31:05.780 --> 31:07.713
I noticed, Cassie.

31:07.715 --> 31:10.316
But the truth is, is it's not
enough if you wanna compete

31:10.318 --> 31:11.817
with Dev and Billy.

31:11.819 --> 31:13.920
You need to work 10 times harder
than they do to get ahead.

31:13.922 --> 31:15.955
And that is just the way that it is.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.356
So that's why you're pushing me?

31:19.293 --> 31:21.427
There's no point in complaining about it.

31:21.429 --> 31:22.929
We signed up for this, and there's no sense

31:22.931 --> 31:24.130
in playing the victim.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.798
You go after what you want,

31:25.800 --> 31:27.900
and you make no apologies about it.

31:29.836 --> 31:32.838
Do you think I deserve to be chief resident?

31:38.979 --> 31:40.680
Yes, Cassie, I do.

31:50.792 --> 31:53.793
- Mr. Adams.
- Dr. Harris.

31:53.795 --> 31:55.461
Sorry, I didn't mean to leave.

31:55.463 --> 31:57.263
Is everything okay?

31:57.265 --> 31:59.432
Yes, the surgery was a success.

31:59.434 --> 32:00.533
She's gonna be all right?

32:00.535 --> 32:02.535
Yes, Claudine's in recovery right now.

32:02.537 --> 32:05.505
Oh, hey!

32:05.507 --> 32:09.208
Uh, sorry. I know some people
aren't huggers.

32:09.210 --> 32:11.144
Yeah, I think in the
circumstances, I'll accept it.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.280
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we go see your wife?

32:14.282 --> 32:18.618
Um, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Claudine,

32:18.620 --> 32:20.787
well, anything about
what we talked about today.

32:20.789 --> 32:22.989
It's none of my business.

32:22.991 --> 32:26.692
I knew before I came.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.629
Yeah. I found out last year.

32:30.898 --> 32:33.699
And you never told her?

32:33.701 --> 32:35.868
I wanted her to tell me.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.938
I don't know. Maybe being passive about it

32:38.940 --> 32:40.706
isn't the greatest approach.

32:40.708 --> 32:44.577
Yeah, maybe you gotta fight a little harder.

32:44.579 --> 32:46.679
It's like this Great White kept,
like, biting the bars

32:46.681 --> 32:48.481
and, like, rattling the cage.

32:48.483 --> 32:52.585
And, like, we look up, and
the latch on the cage was open.

32:52.587 --> 32:53.853
No way.

32:53.855 --> 32:55.521
And he kept, like, circling and circling.

32:55.523 --> 32:56.889
Ugh, I'd be freaking.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.158
I was, like, so scared, I peed my wetsuit.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.160
Yeah, that I can relate to.

33:01.162 --> 33:02.728
It does sound crazy, but...

33:02.730 --> 33:05.531
Oh, man. Must be cool to have a dad, though,

33:05.533 --> 33:06.999
that's like a best friend.

33:07.001 --> 33:09.335
I mean, yeah, but, you know,

33:09.337 --> 33:11.571
sometimes I wish I had more of a dad

33:11.573 --> 33:14.106
than a best friend.

33:14.108 --> 33:16.476
Hmm. Having your game face on all the time

33:16.478 --> 33:18.110
gets pretty tiring, huh?

33:18.112 --> 33:19.846
Yeah.

33:19.848 --> 33:22.415
But, like, don't tell him I said that.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.051
It'll be our secret.

33:25.053 --> 33:28.588
We'll be back to check on him in a moment.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.091
Hey, um, thanks for taking care
of my dad, you know.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.460
Sometimes I can't.

33:39.399 --> 33:43.102
Hey, uh, I was wondering,
not to be too forward,

33:43.104 --> 33:44.537
but I was thinking...

33:44.539 --> 33:46.272
Oh, you're not gonna ask me out, are you?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.876
What? No, no. Aren't you...

33:52.380 --> 33:54.080
Never mind.

33:55.215 --> 33:56.749
What is it, Billy?

33:56.751 --> 33:58.451
Will you be my mentor?

33:58.453 --> 34:00.119
Nobody's ever asked me that before.

34:00.121 --> 34:04.357
Mm. So is that a yes?

34:04.359 --> 34:06.993
Oh, come on, Dr. Lin. Look at this face.

34:06.995 --> 34:09.695
You wanna spend more time with this face.

34:09.697 --> 34:12.532
Thanks, Billy, but no, thanks.

34:12.534 --> 34:16.601
Okay, okay. Look, real talk.

34:19.908 --> 34:23.809
Watching Cassie and Dev in the OR...

34:23.811 --> 34:26.145
I'm not that good.

34:26.147 --> 34:29.782
Not yet, but I can be with your guidance.

34:29.784 --> 34:31.317
I'm not really a Dawn.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.452
Yeah, which is cool because I can't learn

34:33.454 --> 34:35.655
around that kind of pressure.

34:35.657 --> 34:38.991
Reminds me of my old man,
and not in a good way.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.226
I much prefer your style of leadership.

34:41.228 --> 34:42.460
Leadership?

34:42.463 --> 34:45.097
Unconditional positive regard.

34:45.099 --> 34:47.632
It's kind of your brand.

34:47.635 --> 34:50.202
Makes it easy to be real around you.

34:50.204 --> 34:51.469
All right.

34:51.472 --> 34:53.005
Yeah?

34:58.612 --> 35:01.013
Hey, baby, how you feeling?

35:01.015 --> 35:03.950
I've been so worried about you.

35:03.952 --> 35:06.519
They called me after they
found you in the elevator.

35:08.188 --> 35:11.424
Dr. Harris has been looking out for me.

35:11.426 --> 35:12.925
For both of you.

35:15.529 --> 35:17.396
I think maybe we should talk.

35:17.398 --> 35:20.333
I'm really tired, Derek.
Can this wait till tomorrow?

35:20.335 --> 35:23.502
No. It can't.

35:23.504 --> 35:25.204
It has to be now.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.673
'Cause if it's not, well,

35:27.675 --> 35:30.509
I'm not sure I'll be here tomorrow.

35:30.511 --> 35:32.845
I'm fighting for us.

35:35.048 --> 35:38.217
Dr. Harris, uh,

35:38.219 --> 35:40.119
how's she... how's she doing?

35:40.121 --> 35:44.824
Um, Claudine's gonna be fine.

35:44.826 --> 35:46.492
What about Claudia?

35:49.229 --> 35:51.397
I'm not sure Claudia's gonna make it.

35:52.466 --> 35:54.300
Is he a good guy?

35:55.535 --> 35:57.737
He seems to be, yeah.

35:58.705 --> 36:02.375
Good. That's good, uh...

36:02.377 --> 36:05.711
Listen, listen, you mind, uh,
giving her something for me?

36:07.514 --> 36:11.017
That's my name and number, uh, just in case.

36:13.253 --> 36:14.754
That's your real name.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.590
Yeah, uh, you know,
if she wants me in her life,

36:17.592 --> 36:19.925
she can contact me.

36:42.516 --> 36:44.950
Don't forget your "Number One CEO" mug.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.255
Funny.

36:49.257 --> 36:52.224
I'm really sorry that
you're leaving like this.

36:52.226 --> 36:54.493
Good news travels fast, huh?

36:55.930 --> 36:58.931
It's okay. I can use the time.

36:58.933 --> 37:02.168
I'm gonna get my head straightened out.

37:02.170 --> 37:05.404
Figure out how I let this happen.

37:05.406 --> 37:07.506
You've got to let it go, Thomas.

37:07.508 --> 37:09.909
You know, everyone keeps saying that,

37:09.911 --> 37:13.979
but... no one actually believes it.

37:17.651 --> 37:20.152
So that's that, then, huh?

37:20.154 --> 37:22.722
Cassie, I'm sorry

37:22.724 --> 37:24.690
if I made things harder for you here.

37:24.692 --> 37:26.959
- It was never my intention.
- I know, I know that.

37:26.961 --> 37:30.896
And from everything I've seen,

37:30.898 --> 37:33.199
I think you're a great doctor.

37:33.201 --> 37:35.968
Thank you.

37:35.970 --> 37:39.338
Even if you had to flirt with
a pencil pusher to get ahead.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.040
- Oh!
- That was a joke.

37:41.042 --> 37:43.776
At least I didn't
make promises I couldn't keep

37:43.778 --> 37:45.377
to a power-hungry resident.

37:48.549 --> 37:51.150
Okay.

37:51.152 --> 37:54.220
See you around, pencil pusher.

37:55.590 --> 37:59.091
See you around, power-hungry resident.

38:34.795 --> 38:37.496
So total nut job, huh?

38:39.867 --> 38:43.869
Man, um, I was just giving
Dr. Bell a pep talk.

38:43.871 --> 38:45.971
No hard feelings, buddy.

38:45.973 --> 38:49.642
You know, if you have any questions,

38:49.644 --> 38:52.511
I'm more than happy to answer them.

38:52.513 --> 38:54.613
No, no, no, you're not.

38:54.615 --> 38:56.782
You know, 'cause I've already asked you

38:56.784 --> 38:58.450
a couple times now, actually, so...

38:58.452 --> 39:01.253
Hmm.

39:01.255 --> 39:03.055
Okay, since you're offering.

39:03.057 --> 39:05.524
How was it that you knew that
woman was in the elevator?

39:05.526 --> 39:08.894
I just happened to be there, same as you.

39:08.896 --> 39:11.630
Okay, I'll buy that.

39:11.632 --> 39:14.033
But then, you, like, you knew...

39:14.035 --> 39:15.634
like, instantly knew

39:15.636 --> 39:17.236
what was causing the obstruction.

39:17.238 --> 39:19.104
Mm.

39:19.106 --> 39:23.943
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

39:23.945 --> 39:25.444
I know bones.

39:25.446 --> 39:29.415
You know bones.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.717
Anything else?

39:31.719 --> 39:34.820
Yeah, um, just one more thing.

39:34.822 --> 39:36.922
This... this one's a bit awkward though.

39:36.924 --> 39:38.424
Yeah, 'cause, like, the last 30 seconds

39:38.426 --> 39:39.792
haven't been awkward enough?

39:41.528 --> 39:46.198
See, I haven't heard
from Alex since she left.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.633
Should I be worried?

39:50.270 --> 39:52.204
No.

39:52.206 --> 39:53.639
No, she's fine.

39:53.641 --> 39:57.977
She's, um, probably
just at her family's farm

39:57.979 --> 39:59.478
wearing her dad's old sweater

39:59.480 --> 40:02.581
and eating popcorn for dinner.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.149
So you heard from her?

40:04.151 --> 40:05.951
No.

40:05.953 --> 40:09.722
No, I, uh, I just know her.

40:20.233 --> 40:22.801
Shh.

40:22.803 --> 40:25.537
He just went down.

40:25.539 --> 40:27.740
Charlie said he got held up,
but he'll be here any minute.

40:29.210 --> 40:32.711
Well, we should go out to eat. Hmm?

40:32.713 --> 40:34.980
To celebrate our success.

40:34.982 --> 40:37.650
I take it your endonasal
endoscopy went well.

40:37.652 --> 40:40.853
Yes, um, I expect Mrs. Berry
to make a full recovery.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.456
But... but, Jonathan, I am so proud of you.

40:46.927 --> 40:49.428
You know, for following
your hopes and your dreams

40:49.430 --> 40:51.730
and for really putting your heart and soul

40:51.732 --> 40:53.132
into those cookies.

40:53.134 --> 40:54.566
Cut the crap, Shahir.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.971
I know you bait-and-switched my baked goods.

40:58.973 --> 41:02.274
Yes, yes, but I... yes.

41:02.276 --> 41:04.109
That... that's...

41:04.111 --> 41:06.712
Well, you just...

41:06.714 --> 41:10.215
I... love you.

41:13.287 --> 41:15.654
They were that bad, huh?

41:15.656 --> 41:17.990
- They were awful.
- Oh, man.

41:17.992 --> 41:20.092
Babe, why didn't you tell me?

41:20.094 --> 41:22.161
You were so proud of them.

41:24.632 --> 41:27.333
Look, I love that you love me
so much that you'll lie

41:27.335 --> 41:31.303
to my face to protect my feelings, but...

41:32.872 --> 41:34.740
You shouldn't make a habit out of that.

41:36.443 --> 41:39.178
So from now on, promise me

41:39.180 --> 41:42.748
you're always gonna tell me the truth.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.216
- No matter what.
- Okay.

41:44.218 --> 41:45.451
Okay.

41:50.056 --> 41:52.925
I'm tired of being Uncle Shahir.

41:54.694 --> 41:56.528
And I want to be a father.

41:59.532 --> 42:01.266
With you.

42:08.376 --> 42:11.143
So I stopped by Jade Palace on the way home.

42:11.145 --> 42:14.613
Figured I'd thank you guys
for saving my ass today.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.016
I'll get the plates.

42:17.018 --> 42:18.951
And I'll, uh, open some wine.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.887
Yes, please.

42:23.923 --> 42:26.025
Excuse me.

42:28.094 --> 42:31.296
Uh, where do you keep
your corkscrew, Charlie?

42:32.565 --> 42:34.767
Um...

42:34.769 --> 42:37.102
second drawer on the left.

42:37.104 --> 42:39.505
Jonathan, hot sauce.
