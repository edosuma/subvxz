00:01.796 --> 00:03.787
It may not look like it,
but we're professionals.

00:03.864 --> 00:05.331
Do us a favor.

00:05.399 --> 00:07.765
Don't try this at home!
Whoa!

00:07.835 --> 00:10.599
<i>On this episode
of "Mythbusters"...</i>

00:10.671 --> 00:13.333
Jamie, don't jump.
You have so much to live for.

00:13.407 --> 00:15.841
...Adam and Jamie
take out the trash...

00:15.910 --> 00:17.377
Those things
will get ya.

00:17.445 --> 00:18.434
Ow!

00:18.512 --> 00:19.979
...as they test the movie myth

00:20.047 --> 00:22.072
of a dumpster-diving
escape...

00:22.149 --> 00:23.639
A perfect 10!

00:23.718 --> 00:25.777
...and find out
if legging it

00:25.853 --> 00:29.289
after a "trash" landing
is legit.

00:30.658 --> 00:31.955
...Nice job.
... Thank you.

00:32.026 --> 00:35.553
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory, and Grant
go off the deep end...

00:36.897 --> 00:39.195
...with a "ye olde"
diving myth.

00:39.266 --> 00:40.494
Time to go divin'.

00:40.568 --> 00:43.002
<i>Could an
air-supply failure up top...</i>

00:43.070 --> 00:44.867
You're kidding me.
This is working?

00:44.939 --> 00:49.933
...spell a spectacular squeeze
and certain death down below?

00:51.112 --> 00:52.909
Oh! Look at what's happening
to his head!

00:52.980 --> 00:54.379
Yeah!

00:57.251 --> 00:59.515
<i>Who are the Mythbusters?</i>

00:59.587 --> 01:00.747
Adam savage...

01:00.821 --> 01:02.152
I feel
perfectly normal

01:02.223 --> 01:03.383
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:03.457 --> 01:04.822
Pain is your friend.

01:04.891 --> 01:09.829
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:09.897 --> 01:11.762
Joining them...

01:11.832 --> 01:13.265
...Grant Imahara...

01:13.334 --> 01:14.392
Burn!

01:14.468 --> 01:15.400
...Kari Byron...

01:15.469 --> 01:16.936
And I'm starting
to get the idea

01:17.004 --> 01:18.266
that this shouldn't
be done inside.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.670
...Tory Belleci...

01:20.808 --> 01:23.038
...and featuring Jessi Combs.

01:23.110 --> 01:24.372
That was awesome!

01:24.445 --> 01:27.243
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:28.549 --> 01:31.017
They put them to the test.

01:39.460 --> 01:44.022
First up, Adam and Jamie
dive into a film fable.

01:44.098 --> 01:46.191
So I hear you have
a movie myth for us.

01:46.267 --> 01:47.256
I do, old bean.

01:48.269 --> 01:50.931
It seems that within
the logic of an action movie,

01:51.005 --> 01:52.233
any building
can be escaped from

01:52.306 --> 01:54.934
by handily jumping into
a dumpster parked next to it.

01:55.009 --> 01:58.172
Hop out, dust yourself off
and walk away unharmed.

01:58.245 --> 02:00.713
Well, that sounds
like rubbish.

02:00.781 --> 02:02.612
It's an action-movie clichÃ©.

02:02.683 --> 02:06.050
After a roof runaround
with nowhere else to go,

02:06.120 --> 02:10.386
a dive into a dumpster equals
a guaranteed getaway.

02:10.458 --> 02:13.791
But can you really get up and go
every time

02:13.861 --> 02:16.193
after a "trash" landing?

02:16.263 --> 02:18.094
So, how is this
gonna go down?

02:18.165 --> 02:20.656
Well, I figure that any line
of investigation we pursue

02:20.734 --> 02:22.634
is ultimately
hopefully gonna end

02:22.703 --> 02:25.103
with one of us
leaping into a dumpster.

02:25.172 --> 02:26.332
So first things first.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.035
I think we need to be trained
how to fall safely.

02:29.110 --> 02:30.668
I think we need to call

02:30.744 --> 02:32.473
one of the stuntmen we know
to teach us.

02:32.546 --> 02:34.138
Well, I guess it's time
to jump right in, huh?

02:34.215 --> 02:35.807
All right.

02:37.885 --> 02:40.319
Yep, this myth
can only end one way...

02:40.387 --> 02:42.787
with an actual dumpster dive.

02:42.857 --> 02:47.191
And to make sure our Mythbusters
will live to bust another day,

02:47.261 --> 02:50.822
it's off to Treasure Island
for Stunt-Falling 101.

02:50.898 --> 02:53.423
So in our ongoing training
to be action-movie heroes,

02:53.501 --> 02:56.664
we are about to learn
how to take a high fall safely.

02:56.737 --> 02:59.763
And this is the building
we're gonna start with.

03:01.008 --> 03:03.533
This is the air bag
that's gonna break our fall.

03:03.611 --> 03:05.408
And this...

03:05.479 --> 03:08.004
...is the guy
that's gonna train us.

03:08.082 --> 03:11.711
That's Randy Lamb,
stunt coordinator and fall guy.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.015
Oh, this is cool
in here!

03:15.089 --> 03:16.351
As Jamie said,

03:16.423 --> 03:18.948
they're not starting
on the dumpsters just yet.

03:19.026 --> 03:20.516
First there's this.

03:22.129 --> 03:24.927
How does this
air bag work, you ask?

03:24.999 --> 03:28.992
Well, it's called a two-stage
air bag, and it works thusly.

03:29.069 --> 03:32.334
The first stage, this top part,
slows you down by popping,

03:32.406 --> 03:35.239
by opening through this very
portal that I climbed out of.

03:35.309 --> 03:38.039
The second stage,
that bottom layer, stops you.

03:38.112 --> 03:40.580
It does not deflate.

03:40.648 --> 03:43.139
<i>And that's key,</i>

03:43.217 --> 03:47.313
because the name of this game
is deceleration.

03:47.388 --> 03:49.879
Like they say, it's not the fall
that kills you,

03:49.957 --> 03:51.322
it's the sudden stop.

03:51.392 --> 03:54.054
A jump from a height
onto a hard surface

03:54.128 --> 03:56.653
will bring you to a stop
very quickly.

03:56.730 --> 04:00.166
And it's this sudden impact
that is potentially fatal.

04:00.234 --> 04:04.728
But landing on a soft surface
maximizes deceleration,

04:04.805 --> 04:07.069
dissipating impact
over a longer time,

04:07.141 --> 04:08.870
reducing the risk of injury.

04:08.943 --> 04:11.503
Randy, Falling 101.
What do we have to know?

04:11.579 --> 04:12.876
When you jump,

04:12.947 --> 04:15.177
you want to make sure
that you land flat on your back

04:15.249 --> 04:17.183
and use up as much volume
as possible.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.649
Awesome!
Can we get started?

04:18.719 --> 04:19.947
Sure.
Who wants to go first?

04:20.019 --> 04:21.385
Me!
I want to go first.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.980
Is that okay if I go first?
Can I go first? Is that cool?

04:24.058 --> 04:25.525
...Yay.
... All right. Follow me.

04:25.593 --> 04:26.719
<i>Unsurprisingly,</i>

04:26.794 --> 04:30.230
Adam is falling over himself
to get started.

04:30.297 --> 04:31.559
Less is more.

04:31.632 --> 04:33.395
Yeah, it's a lot higher now,
isn't it?

04:33.467 --> 04:34.593
All right.
Here we go.

04:34.668 --> 04:35.965
But at a height of 13 feet,

04:36.036 --> 04:38.300
getting the technique right
is vital.

04:38.372 --> 04:41.170
...Place your left foot right here.
... All right.

04:41.242 --> 04:43.107
Now, you're gonna take
one giant step out

04:43.177 --> 04:45.702
and lay back just like
you were laying into a recliner.

04:51.952 --> 04:52.919
Perfect.

04:55.456 --> 04:57.185
Wow!

04:57.258 --> 04:58.589
That's cool!

04:58.659 --> 05:02.755
And if at first you succeed,
why not go again?

05:02.830 --> 05:04.798
And again.

05:04.865 --> 05:06.924
And again.

05:07.001 --> 05:08.798
It looked like
you did it perfectly.

05:08.869 --> 05:10.564
With that
out of his system...

05:10.638 --> 05:12.162
That was awesome!

05:12.239 --> 05:13.831
Don't look now,
but there's a Hyneman

05:13.907 --> 05:16.842
on the roof of that building,
and I think he's gonna jump.

05:16.910 --> 05:20.437
Jamie, don't jump.
You have so much to live for.

05:24.285 --> 05:28.483
You know, it's a little
bit of a jolt, but it works.

05:29.623 --> 05:33.389
Much better. Excellent.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.587
I think you guys have both
got this height down.

05:35.663 --> 05:37.153
Awesome!
'Cause I want to go higher.

05:37.231 --> 05:39.199
...Can we go higher?
... Let's go.

05:39.266 --> 05:42.292
<i>Yep, it's as easy
as moving the air bag</i>

05:42.369 --> 05:43.563
to a new location.

05:43.637 --> 05:45.195
Or is it?

05:45.272 --> 05:46.762
Well, we're about to
bump it up a notch.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.807
And make no mistake...

05:47.875 --> 05:49.740
when you're looking down
at that bag,

05:49.810 --> 05:52.677
there's a pretty big difference
between 13 feet...

05:55.149 --> 05:56.741
...and 20 feet.

05:56.817 --> 06:01.220
The stakes just went up,
and so did my adrenaline level.

06:02.189 --> 06:03.315
<i>And this time,</i>

06:03.390 --> 06:06.621
Jamie's drawn the short straw
to jump first.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:15.936 --> 06:18.131
Perfect!

06:18.205 --> 06:19.263
How you feeling?

06:19.340 --> 06:21.865
That was no worse
than the smaller one.

06:21.942 --> 06:23.239
Cool.

06:23.310 --> 06:25.175
My turn!

06:29.416 --> 06:30.974
Perfect.

06:34.254 --> 06:35.721
Perfect!

06:35.789 --> 06:37.313
...Nice job.
... How'd that feel?

06:37.391 --> 06:38.756
Felt great.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.851
<i>And now that both the guys</i>

06:40.928 --> 06:43.795
have mastered the art
of falling from a great height,

06:43.864 --> 06:45.855
they can get their hands dirty.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.457
I think
I'm getting this down.

06:47.534 --> 06:48.728
I think you are.

06:48.802 --> 06:49.996
What's next?

06:50.070 --> 06:51.503
You're gonna love this.

06:56.143 --> 07:00.910
Now from high diving
to deep-sea diving.

07:00.981 --> 07:02.972
Before the days
of scuba diving,

07:03.050 --> 07:04.745
divers would go down
in those old suits

07:04.818 --> 07:08.117
with those brass helmets, just like this, right?
... Sure.

07:08.188 --> 07:10.122
They would pressurize their suit
using a compressor

07:10.190 --> 07:11.748
on a boat at the surface.

07:11.825 --> 07:13.292
To counteract
the external water pressure.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.486
Exactly.

07:14.561 --> 07:16.552
That sounds like
an accident waiting to happen.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.120
And that's what
this myth is about.

07:18.198 --> 07:21.463
If that compressor were to stop
or the air hose would get cut,

07:21.535 --> 07:23.560
that diver would come
to a grisly end.

07:23.637 --> 07:25.229
Yeah, without
the high-pressure air

07:25.305 --> 07:26.863
helping to keep
the suit inflated,

07:26.940 --> 07:28.874
it would simply crush under
the weight of all the water.

07:28.942 --> 07:30.034
That's right.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.839
And the pressure would change
so suddenly,

07:31.912 --> 07:33.243
it would be so dramatic,

07:33.313 --> 07:37.010
that it would literally squish
the diver into the helmet.

07:37.084 --> 07:38.176
Sick.

07:38.252 --> 07:39.913
I love it.

07:39.987 --> 07:43.616
<i>Yep, according to
this macabre maritime myth,</i>

07:43.690 --> 07:46.386
early deep-sea-diving suits
had a flaw,

07:46.460 --> 07:48.724
whereby a failure
in the air supply

07:48.796 --> 07:51.230
could cause
a drastic depressurization.

07:51.298 --> 07:53.562
But could
the pressure differential

07:53.634 --> 07:56.535
really put the squeeze
on an entire human body,

07:56.603 --> 07:59.731
or is this a load
of "Pulp Fiction"?

07:59.807 --> 08:01.138
So, how do we
test this?

08:01.208 --> 08:04.268
Ultimately, I think we need to
build one of these suits,

08:04.344 --> 08:05.606
put a human analogue
in it,

08:05.679 --> 08:07.237
drop it to the bottom
of the ocean,

08:07.314 --> 08:09.305
cut the line,
and see what happens.

08:09.383 --> 08:10.850
See if we get
instant sausages.

08:10.918 --> 08:12.180
Or whatever.

08:12.252 --> 08:13.446
Okay, before we do
all of that,

08:13.520 --> 08:14.782
I think we need to do
two things.

08:14.855 --> 08:16.379
We need to go talk
to an expert,

08:16.457 --> 08:18.618
and we need to do
a few proof-of-concept tests.

08:18.692 --> 08:20.956
<i>And at San Francisco Maritime</i>

08:21.028 --> 08:22.518
National Historical Park,

08:22.596 --> 08:27.761
ex-Navy diver Mike Ward
is just the expert Kari needs.

08:27.835 --> 08:29.803
What kind of diving
were these suits used for?

08:29.870 --> 08:32.736
They were used
for salvage diving,

08:32.806 --> 08:36.264
mariculture diving,
sea harvesting, construction.

08:36.342 --> 08:39.369
They were used for virtually
every kind of diving.

08:39.446 --> 08:43.974
This was the very first real
type of commercial diving suit.

08:44.051 --> 08:45.518
How deep do they go?

08:45.586 --> 08:47.315
Down to 300 feet
on average.

08:47.387 --> 08:49.378
300 feet
is quite a depth.

08:49.456 --> 08:52.220
But as Mike explains
how the suit works,

08:52.292 --> 08:53.987
there's one feature
that's troubling Kari...

08:54.061 --> 08:56.928
the non-return valve.

08:56.997 --> 08:59.227
In the event
that the hose gets cut,

08:59.299 --> 09:01.494
the pressure differential

09:01.568 --> 09:03.331
automatically forces
the valve shut.

09:03.403 --> 09:06.065
Doesn't allow anything
to go up the umbilical.

09:06.139 --> 09:08.699
You need a dive suit
without a non-return valve

09:08.775 --> 09:10.470
for this myth
to be possible.

09:10.544 --> 09:11.670
I would test it
as though

09:11.745 --> 09:13.508
the non-return valve
wasn't working right.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.514
A lot of times divers
wouldn't do the maintenance

09:15.582 --> 09:16.776
and the valve
would get stuck,

09:16.850 --> 09:18.977
and that would cause
the failure.

09:19.052 --> 09:21.213
So according
to our dive master,

09:21.288 --> 09:25.816
the particulars of this myth
are positively plausible.

09:25.893 --> 09:29.056
Which means it's time
to get down to business.

09:29.129 --> 09:30.391
As always on "Mythbusters,"

09:30.464 --> 09:32.489
we're gonna start out
in the small scale.

09:32.566 --> 09:34.534
Basically, I'm gonna make
a tiny little diver

09:34.601 --> 09:36.034
that we can do
some experiments on

09:36.103 --> 09:38.901
and find out what kind of effect
suction really is going to have

09:38.972 --> 09:41.167
and let us design
our big experiment.

09:41.241 --> 09:43.436
<i>And as Kari's
voodoo diver takes shape,</i>

09:43.510 --> 09:48.004
it's clear who
the sacrificial mini-me will be.

09:48.081 --> 09:50.948
The diver is becoming
little Grant.

09:51.018 --> 09:52.576
Kari's sculpture
turned out great,

09:52.653 --> 09:53.847
and it looks just like Grant.

09:53.921 --> 09:56.082
But in order to test this
small scale,

09:56.156 --> 09:59.125
I need to turn this clay figure
into a ballistics-gel figure

09:59.192 --> 10:00.955
wearing a watertight
diving suit.

10:01.028 --> 10:02.655
Now, the way I'm gonna do that

10:02.729 --> 10:05.129
is I'm gonna make
a plaster mold of the sculpture.

10:07.634 --> 10:09.363
Hey, look at that.

10:09.436 --> 10:12.405
It's like Han Solo,
frozen in carbonite.

10:12.472 --> 10:14.463
That way I'll have
two halves of a mold

10:14.541 --> 10:16.441
that I can paint in latex
and cloth.

10:16.510 --> 10:18.478
So that way,
it'll be both watertight

10:18.545 --> 10:21.105
and it'll be durable.

10:24.685 --> 10:27.745
Once the latex is dry, I'll put
the two halves together,

10:27.821 --> 10:31.814
and I'll fill the whole thing up
with ballistics gel.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.325
Once the ballistic gel sets,

10:33.393 --> 10:34.883
I'll be able to open up
the mold,

10:34.962 --> 10:37.931
and what I'll be left with
is a mini Grant diver

10:37.998 --> 10:41.161
made out of ballistics gel
in a watertight diving suit.

10:44.571 --> 10:46.368
Oh, look at that!

10:46.440 --> 10:48.431
...Ohh!
... Look. His little suit's there.

10:48.508 --> 10:50.100
It's loose on his body.
That's perfect.

10:50.177 --> 10:51.508
It'll fill right up
with air.

10:51.578 --> 10:52.875
This is gonna be perfect.

10:52.946 --> 10:55.278
I got to do a little bit
of repair work on the seams,

10:55.349 --> 10:57.044
but we're good to go.

10:57.117 --> 10:58.175
It's gonna work.

10:58.251 --> 11:00.185
Now all he needs
is a helmet.

11:00.253 --> 11:02.744
<i>Which is exactly
what his life-size namesake</i>

11:02.823 --> 11:04.085
is working on.

11:04.157 --> 11:06.182
Now, this is an old-timey
dive helmet

11:06.259 --> 11:08.454
similar to the one they describe
in the myth.

11:08.528 --> 11:13.397
And I'm going to be simulating
it using this clear acrylic.

11:13.467 --> 11:17.233
Now, I've chosen this so that
if we do in fact see a squeeze,

11:17.304 --> 11:19.272
like in the myth,
that goes up into the helmet,

11:19.339 --> 11:23.673
we'll have a full 360 view
so that we won't miss anything.

11:23.744 --> 11:25.336
<i>And the finishing touch...</i>

11:25.412 --> 11:29.007
a gauge to keep an eye
on the pressure inside the suit

11:29.082 --> 11:31.414
once they throw him in
at the deep end.

11:34.655 --> 11:35.587
According to Hollywood,

11:35.656 --> 11:38.090
any dumpster
is a guaranteed getaway.

11:38.158 --> 11:40.854
But what exactly will you find
inside one?

11:40.927 --> 11:44.363
This looks like the place.
Look at all these dumpsters!

11:44.431 --> 11:48.026
We've come to the natural
habitat of the dumpster...

11:48.101 --> 11:49.432
Waste Management facility...

11:49.503 --> 11:51.994
and we've got our pick
to look through.

11:52.072 --> 11:55.599
<i>To find out
if here in the real world</i>

11:55.676 --> 11:58.702
a dumpster is the soft landing
this myth suggests.

11:58.779 --> 12:00.110
Hi, Jamie!

12:00.180 --> 12:01.772
Put us on your feet!

12:01.848 --> 12:03.782
Looks like all cardboard,

12:03.850 --> 12:07.342
but I see some wood
and some rebar down there.

12:07.421 --> 12:09.048
Rebar?

12:09.122 --> 12:11.022
And after a savage scavenge,

12:11.091 --> 12:14.527
it's clear a fall
into this dumpster

12:14.594 --> 12:15.959
will be anything but soft.

12:16.029 --> 12:19.362
It's all wood under here.
This dumpster is deadly!

12:19.433 --> 12:23.096
So they move on to two more
dumpsters picked at random.

12:23.170 --> 12:27.038
All this blue stuff says, to me,
"hospital waste. "

12:27.107 --> 12:28.438
Yeah.

12:28.508 --> 12:31.966
Kind of don't want to mess
around with this one too much.

12:32.045 --> 12:33.444
Yeah.

12:33.513 --> 12:34.878
If you gave me the choice

12:34.948 --> 12:37.007
of jumping into a dumpster
full of hospital waste

12:37.084 --> 12:38.415
or dealing with
the bad guys,

12:38.485 --> 12:41.852
I'm gonna think pretty carefully
about dealing with the bad guys.

12:44.558 --> 12:47.049
Ohh!

12:47.127 --> 12:49.357
Hey, that's kind of neat.

12:49.429 --> 12:51.363
Open cardboard bo xes.

12:51.431 --> 12:54.059
Except again, there's
this hidden stuff in there,

12:54.134 --> 12:55.726
like those pallets.

12:55.802 --> 12:57.736
Plus, the deeper
into the dumpster they dig...

12:57.804 --> 13:00.170
You got to aim away
from the pallets.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.037
Those things
will get ya.

13:02.109 --> 13:03.633
...the worse the news.

13:03.710 --> 13:05.473
This is clearly
one of those situations

13:05.545 --> 13:07.342
where you can't judge a book
by its cover.

13:07.414 --> 13:10.474
You're on top of the building
looking down into the dumpster.

13:10.550 --> 13:13.576
It looks nice and soft, but you
don't know what's underneath it.

13:13.653 --> 13:15.484
You could be
in for a nasty surprise.

13:15.555 --> 13:18.649
<i>For soft landings,
they're zero for three.</i>

13:18.725 --> 13:21.660
But if any dumpster meets
the cushioning criteria,

13:21.728 --> 13:23.286
Kevin Floyd will know about it.

13:23.363 --> 13:25.058
Do you ever
have dumpsters come in

13:25.132 --> 13:28.295
that just have
a bunch of soft stuff inside?

13:28.368 --> 13:29.596
Occasionally.

13:29.669 --> 13:32.661
But we get about 10,000
to 12,000 loads a year.

13:32.739 --> 13:36.300
Maybe one or two a month
would come like that.

13:36.376 --> 13:40.574
What I can think of is items
from a factory with foam.

13:40.647 --> 13:42.581
That'd be a nice,
soft load.

13:42.649 --> 13:43.911
But for the most part,

13:43.984 --> 13:45.611
it's mostly mixed,
like what you've seen.

13:45.685 --> 13:48.210
Well, I think our path
is pretty clear.

13:48.288 --> 13:49.619
Yeah... down.

13:50.891 --> 13:53.553
So after their
excursion to Dumpsterville,

13:53.627 --> 13:55.060
what have they learned?

13:55.128 --> 13:58.791
You know, jumping into any old
dumpster is not a good idea.

13:58.865 --> 14:00.628
You never know
what you're gonna get,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.691
and, I mean,
it could be really dangerous.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.100
It's not looking good
for the myth.

14:04.171 --> 14:06.332
Yeah, but by the same token,
you could get lucky.

14:06.406 --> 14:07.805
I mean,
for all you know,

14:07.874 --> 14:10.536
you could be jumping into the
dumpster of a pillow factory.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.373
I think we should
narrow down the field

14:12.445 --> 14:16.438
to choose an ideal material,
a best-case scenario,

14:16.516 --> 14:17.778
and fall into that.

14:17.851 --> 14:19.819
...And see if it's possible.
... Exactly.

14:19.886 --> 14:20.978
Works for me.

14:21.054 --> 14:23.318
And courtesy
of garbage guru Kevin,

14:23.390 --> 14:26.325
they've assembled
four likely suspects.

14:26.393 --> 14:28.486
What we're gonna do
with each of our materials

14:28.562 --> 14:30.530
is we're gonna put them
in a stack,

14:30.597 --> 14:32.155
and I'm basically gonna jump
on them.

14:32.232 --> 14:34.166
We'll use the high-speed camera
to analyze my jumps.

14:34.234 --> 14:37.067
And for those of you playing
at home, what we're looking for

14:37.137 --> 14:39.799
is the material
that decelerates me the best...

14:39.873 --> 14:42.774
that slows my descent
better than all of the others.

14:42.843 --> 14:45.812
That's the one we're gonna use
for our final test.

14:45.879 --> 14:48.677
<i>First up...
potential filler number one.</i>

14:48.748 --> 14:50.375
Cardboard bo xes.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.611
We've used them before
on the show for safety,

14:52.686 --> 14:53.880
and they do crush.

14:53.954 --> 14:56.445
You find them everywhere
in dumpsters,

14:56.523 --> 14:59.083
so they might be
just the thing for our test.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.148
Right!

15:04.197 --> 15:07.325
That wasn't as spectacular
as I was afraid it would be.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.424
It did collapse,

15:08.501 --> 15:10.196
and it did soften your landing,
didn't it?

15:10.270 --> 15:11.703
Yeah.
Certainly did.

15:11.771 --> 15:13.762
<i>And alternative number two?</i>

15:13.840 --> 15:15.239
Shredded paper.

15:15.308 --> 15:17.003
Not supposed to be finding it
in a dumpster,

15:17.077 --> 15:18.567
because you're supposed to
recycle it.

15:18.645 --> 15:19.907
But it could happen.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.504
3, 2, 1.

15:24.484 --> 15:25.473
Enh.

15:25.552 --> 15:27.349
<i>Dumpster option number three.</i>

15:27.420 --> 15:29.047
Packing peanuts.

15:29.122 --> 15:32.285
If they use them to protect
objects inside a bo x from shock,

15:32.359 --> 15:34.759
they ought to work
to protect us from shock.

15:34.828 --> 15:36.318
It's sort of
a neater stack,

15:36.396 --> 15:38.557
but I don't know
whether it's gonna crush

15:38.632 --> 15:40.122
as much
as the bo xes did.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.098
Well, let's see.

15:45.105 --> 15:46.504
Not bad, really.

15:46.573 --> 15:49.167
<i>And the final contender.</i>

15:49.242 --> 15:50.231
Foam rubber.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.800
Any place
that makes upholstery products

15:51.878 --> 15:54.005
is gonna have foam cutoffs.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.844
If it's good enough to sit on
or sleep on,

15:56.917 --> 15:59.283
my guess is that it's
good enough to jump into.

16:00.854 --> 16:03.482
Ooh.

16:03.556 --> 16:04.921
That was nice.

16:04.991 --> 16:06.822
That definitely
compressed more.

16:06.893 --> 16:09.384
It compressed more
and was a nice, soft landing.

16:09.462 --> 16:12.625
<i>And after taking
a look at the high-speeds,</i>

16:12.699 --> 16:15.361
it's clear the slowest landing
was the foam.

16:15.435 --> 16:16.902
Compared to the other materials,

16:16.970 --> 16:19.837
it brought Adam to a stop
in double the time,

16:19.906 --> 16:24.605
meaning it put
the least impact on his body.

16:24.678 --> 16:26.168
For my money,
I think we're agreed.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.679
...It's the foam.
... Yeah.

16:27.747 --> 16:29.044
Foam rubber is our winner.

16:29.115 --> 16:31.208
Not only did it give us
the softest landing,

16:31.284 --> 16:33.184
but it seemed to be
the most reliable,

16:33.253 --> 16:36.086
the least likely
to kind of move out of our way

16:36.156 --> 16:37.555
when we jumped into it.

16:37.624 --> 16:40.559
So that's what we're gonna be
filling our dumpster with.

16:42.963 --> 16:46.490
<i>In this
old time diving disaster myth,</i>

16:46.566 --> 16:51.230
an air-supply failure puts
the squeeze on an entire diver.

16:51.304 --> 16:55.297
So could a mistake up top
mean death down below?

16:55.375 --> 16:56.342
To find out...

16:57.644 --> 16:59.373
...the team has found
the perfect location.

17:00.613 --> 17:02.513
...Hi!
... Hi!

17:02.582 --> 17:04.482
<i>With an added bonus.</i>

17:04.550 --> 17:06.108
That is so cool.

17:06.185 --> 17:08.119
And after their brush
with the life aquatic,

17:08.188 --> 17:10.281
it's down to business.

17:10.357 --> 17:12.757
We're at Six Flags
Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo,

17:12.826 --> 17:14.349
where they have a diving tank
that's deeper

17:14.426 --> 17:15.553
than any pool we can find.

17:15.627 --> 17:17.185
So we figured
this is the best place

17:17.262 --> 17:18.855
for us to do all of our
small-scale testing.

17:18.932 --> 17:22.333
He survived the trip.

17:22.402 --> 17:23.630
Oh, cool.
You painted him red.

17:23.703 --> 17:25.603
Yeah, that way
if something does happen,

17:25.672 --> 17:27.002
we'll be able to see
if his body

17:27.073 --> 17:29.234
does get sucked up
into the helmet.

17:31.177 --> 17:33.145
To test this myth,

17:33.213 --> 17:35.875
Tory's going to take our diver
down to the bottom of the pool.

17:35.949 --> 17:38.042
Grant and I are gonna be
at the top monitoring,

17:38.118 --> 17:40.382
shut down the compressor,
see what happens.

17:40.453 --> 17:42.318
<i>Well, what should happen</i>

17:42.389 --> 17:44.289
is a drastic
pressure differential.

17:44.357 --> 17:47.485
As the diver descends,
the compressed air counteracts

17:47.560 --> 17:49.687
the pressure of the water
outside.

17:49.763 --> 17:52.357
However,
when the air supply is cut,

17:52.432 --> 17:53.797
the balance is lost,

17:53.867 --> 17:57.564
and the force of the water
pushes in on the soft suit.

17:57.637 --> 18:00.037
But at only 15 feet under,

18:00.106 --> 18:01.573
will the water pressure
be enough

18:01.641 --> 18:05.236
to squish the tiny diver
into his helmet?

18:05.311 --> 18:07.836
The team is skeptical.

18:07.914 --> 18:11.372
My feeling is, since the gelatin
is the same density as water,

18:11.451 --> 18:12.850
since it's basically
made up of water,

18:12.919 --> 18:14.853
I don't think we're gonna see
much happen.

18:14.921 --> 18:16.149
Even though the gelatin

18:16.222 --> 18:17.689
is much softer
than the human body,

18:17.757 --> 18:19.588
I still have
a really hard time believing

18:19.659 --> 18:22.059
that we're gonna get the kind
of pressure it's gonna take

18:22.128 --> 18:23.755
to push the body
up into the helmet.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.856
But that's why we do
small-scale testing.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.731
So to put
the theory to the test...

18:29.803 --> 18:31.998
Okay.
Pressurizing the suit.

18:32.072 --> 18:35.599
...Tory takes the diver
to the deep end,

18:35.675 --> 18:37.870
and Kari and Grant pull
the proverbial plug.

18:37.944 --> 18:41.641
Okay.
Compressor failure.

18:41.714 --> 18:46.048
In 3, 2, 1.

18:52.826 --> 18:54.521
That's good.

18:57.764 --> 19:00.255
You're kidding me!
This is working?

19:06.606 --> 19:07.630
Yeah!

19:07.707 --> 19:10.301
<i>Even at a depth
of only 15 feet,</i>

19:10.376 --> 19:14.005
the pressure differential
squeezes mini diver Imahara

19:14.080 --> 19:17.345
like a tube of toothpaste.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.475
It totally worked!

19:18.551 --> 19:20.815
It smashed the body
into the helmet.

19:20.887 --> 19:21.876
Oh, my God!

19:21.955 --> 19:23.149
That is awesome!

19:23.223 --> 19:25.418
Look at his
freaking rib cage!

19:25.492 --> 19:28.052
<i>And that incredible result</i>

19:28.128 --> 19:30.289
has the team
eating their words.

19:30.363 --> 19:31.625
It worked!
It actually worked!

19:31.698 --> 19:33.598
The water pressure was enough
to compress the suit

19:33.666 --> 19:36.134
and squish the body
into the helmet.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.796
Nobody expected that,
but I love it when we're wrong.

19:38.872 --> 19:40.772
I think we have
a perfect proof of concept here.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.967
We can totally move on
to large scale.

19:43.042 --> 19:44.134
I think you're right.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.371
I'm calling it
"coolest small-scale ever. "

19:46.446 --> 19:47.913
Totally.

19:48.248 --> 19:50.614
That was awesome!

19:50.683 --> 19:52.674
Yeah. I've always wanted
to kiss a dolphin.

19:52.752 --> 19:53.878
No, not that.
The experiment!

19:53.953 --> 19:54.942
Yeah, that was awesome.

19:55.021 --> 19:56.784
The second we turned off
the compressor,

19:56.856 --> 19:58.255
the guy really did
get squished.

19:58.324 --> 20:00.292
Yeah, but, you know,
there is a big difference

20:00.360 --> 20:02.590
between human flesh
and that gelatin.

20:02.662 --> 20:04.027
And would that
have really happened

20:04.097 --> 20:05.496
if we had a more fleshlike
material?

20:05.565 --> 20:07.692
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

20:07.767 --> 20:09.359
We go full scale.
Who's in?

20:09.435 --> 20:10.493
I'm in.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.128
Actually, no.

20:12.205 --> 20:14.833
As you can see, I'm about to
bring a mini Mythbuster

20:14.908 --> 20:16.432
into this world any moment now.

20:16.509 --> 20:18.477
So I've got a replacement
for you,

20:18.545 --> 20:19.705
and she's going to be great.

20:19.779 --> 20:21.508
But I'll see you guys
in a few episodes.

20:21.581 --> 20:22.639
Bye, Kari.

20:22.715 --> 20:23.647
Bye, Kari.
Good luck.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.115
...Hi, guys.
... Whoa.

20:25.185 --> 20:26.482
What are you, a ninja?

20:26.553 --> 20:27.679
Kinda.
I'm Jessi.

20:27.754 --> 20:29.449
...Hi, Jessi.
... Well, welcome aboard.

20:29.522 --> 20:30.989
I hope you don't
get seasick.

20:31.057 --> 20:32.046
Nah, I'm good.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.752
So, what's the plan
for the squeeze?

20:33.826 --> 20:35.293
Well, we're gonna go
full scale.

20:35.361 --> 20:37.795
And for that, we need
a genuine Mark V dive suit.

20:37.864 --> 20:39.832
We're gonna take it
all the way down to 300 feet.

20:39.899 --> 20:42.697
Yeah, and considering no one
wants to volunteer for this one,

20:42.769 --> 20:45.260
we're gonna make
a human analogue out of pork.

20:45.338 --> 20:46.498
...Sick.
... Did Kari warn you

20:46.573 --> 20:48.473
about some of the weird things
we do on this show?

20:48.541 --> 20:51.374
...Yeah, maybe not this weird, but I'm in.
... Cool.

20:51.444 --> 20:52.843
<i>Speaking of weird...</i>

20:52.912 --> 20:55.244
Now, in order to go full scale
on this one,

20:55.315 --> 20:57.647
we're gonna need something
more human-like.

20:57.717 --> 21:00.311
So I give you...

21:00.386 --> 21:01.614
Meat Man.

21:01.688 --> 21:04.452
Things are gonna get creepy
around here.

21:08.995 --> 21:12.431
<i>Actually it's going to
get creepy in a freezer truck.</i>

21:15.702 --> 21:17.499
So what I have here
is a bunch of pork,

21:17.570 --> 21:19.595
which I've had the butchers
keep the skin on.

21:19.672 --> 21:22.505
This is the meat that I'm gonna
wrap around the plastic skeleton

21:22.575 --> 21:23.872
in order to make my meat man.

21:23.943 --> 21:29.108
This is gonna be so cool!

21:29.182 --> 21:30.979
All right, this part might be
a little gross.

21:36.289 --> 21:38.416
<i>But luckily
for our squeamish viewers,</i>

21:38.491 --> 21:42.985
that ain't the only way they're
making this test more authentic.

21:43.062 --> 21:45.622
This is an honest-to-goodness
commercial dive helmet,

21:45.698 --> 21:47.290
just like the one in the myth.

21:47.367 --> 21:50.598
I'm gonna clean up the view port
so we can see inside,

21:50.670 --> 21:53.571
change out the valves,
and we should be good to go.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.437
A little help?

21:59.512 --> 22:01.742
<i>Modifications complete,</i>

22:01.814 --> 22:05.215
Grant puts the entire ensemble
together for a dry run.

22:05.285 --> 22:09.085
And to control the flow of air,
he's whipped up this.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.850
The idea with the manifold

22:10.923 --> 22:13.721
is that we are simulating
cutting the line

22:13.793 --> 22:16.785
without actually
physically cutting the line.

22:16.863 --> 22:19.229
The air from the compressor
comes in through here

22:19.299 --> 22:21.028
and goes out to the suit here.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.000
When I want to simulate the cut,

22:23.069 --> 22:26.197
blow open the dump valve
and everything goes "whoosh!"

22:29.475 --> 22:31.705
Yeah.
That's good.

22:31.778 --> 22:33.643
So you're gonna cut off
the main air supply.

22:36.282 --> 22:39.149
And put on my ear protection.

22:39.218 --> 22:41.448
Okay. Everybody ready?
Here we go.

22:41.521 --> 22:44.285
In 3, 2, 1.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.287
<i>Barely a breeze.</i>

22:48.361 --> 22:50.659
But that's exactly
what's supposed to happen,

22:50.730 --> 22:52.061
right, Grant?

22:52.131 --> 22:53.462
One second.

22:53.533 --> 22:56.297
Well, it is venting,
which is good news.

22:56.369 --> 22:57.802
I think the thing is,

22:57.870 --> 23:00.338
there wasn't much pressure
in there to begin with,

23:00.406 --> 23:02.704
only maybe 5 psi.

23:02.775 --> 23:05.107
And the pressure on the outside
is zero.

23:05.178 --> 23:08.170
It's just regular
atmospheric pressure.

23:08.247 --> 23:10.807
So when we get
down to 300 feet,

23:10.883 --> 23:13.943
there'll be a tremendous amount
of pressure on the outside

23:14.020 --> 23:15.954
pushing in to exhaust this.

23:16.022 --> 23:18.388
Hopefully that will generate
the squeeze

23:18.458 --> 23:19.550
that we're looking for.

23:19.625 --> 23:20.683
<i>Absolutely.</i>

23:20.760 --> 23:22.694
Because although
there's no pressure

23:22.762 --> 23:24.195
acting on the suit topside,

23:24.263 --> 23:26.458
at 300 feet below the surface,

23:26.532 --> 23:30.195
there'll be 135 pounds
of water pressure

23:30.269 --> 23:31.998
per every square inch.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.436
That's the theory.

23:33.506 --> 23:37.636
But how are they gonna film
the experiment 300 feet under?

23:37.710 --> 23:39.439
Light and motion
has hooked us up

23:39.512 --> 23:42.106
with these state-of-the-art
underwater camera housings

23:42.181 --> 23:44.308
so we can capture
all of the action.

23:44.384 --> 23:46.875
Now, it's my job to make sure
all of them are mounted safely

23:46.953 --> 23:49.421
and securely,
which is gonna require

23:49.489 --> 23:51.889
a little bit of welding
and some modifications.

23:53.526 --> 23:55.619
<i>As well as the cameras,</i>

23:55.695 --> 23:59.222
the cage will secure the diver
for his descent into the deep.

23:59.298 --> 24:01.027
Bad piece of crossmember!

24:01.100 --> 24:02.965
<i>And while Jessi welds,</i>

24:03.035 --> 24:07.165
Tory has spent far too much
time alone in the ice truck.

24:09.575 --> 24:12.066
It's alive!

24:13.546 --> 24:16.071
Meat Man is almost done.

24:16.149 --> 24:18.276
I know what you're saying...
he's looking a little freaky.

24:18.351 --> 24:20.285
And there's probably
a bunch of you out there saying,

24:20.353 --> 24:22.082
"Why in the heck
are you doing this?

24:22.155 --> 24:24.680
Why are you sewing a bunch
of meat together on a skeleton?

24:24.757 --> 24:26.384
Are you trying to freak us out?"

24:26.459 --> 24:27.585
Well, no.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.594
What I'm trying to do
is make a human analogue.

24:29.662 --> 24:33.189
With this I have actual muscle
tissue, I have fat, I have skin.

24:33.266 --> 24:35.791
I mean, this is as close
to using a human being

24:35.868 --> 24:37.961
without actually
using a human being.

24:38.037 --> 24:42.565
So if I'm freaking
a few of you out, I'm sorry.

24:42.642 --> 24:44.166
Science isn't always pretty.

24:45.311 --> 24:47.836
<i>Not pretty,
but Meat Man will be</i>

24:47.914 --> 24:51.611
the best possible human
analogue for the test.

24:51.684 --> 24:54.847
I present to you my creation...

24:54.921 --> 24:55.888
Meat Man!

24:58.591 --> 25:01.924
Ooh. Almost threw up.
That's gross.

25:01.994 --> 25:03.985
<i>And while he stays on ice...</i>

25:05.064 --> 25:07.396
...a similar-sized stand-in...

25:07.467 --> 25:08.593
You okay in there?

25:08.668 --> 25:11.159
...steps up
to test Jessi's cage rig.

25:11.237 --> 25:12.363
Oh, yeah.

25:12.438 --> 25:13.803
I'm like a cage dancer.
Yeah.

25:13.873 --> 25:15.932
...Should we go to lunch?
... Yeah.

25:16.008 --> 25:17.441
...Good job.
... Okay. Get me out of here.

25:17.510 --> 25:18.704
Thanks for your help.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.975
Oh, totally not cool.

25:22.048 --> 25:25.176
So not cool!

25:25.985 --> 25:27.714
Dumpster diving,
Hollywood-style.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.618
We know that you
can survive a fall

25:29.689 --> 25:31.156
from a reasonably high height

25:31.224 --> 25:32.987
if you've got
the right technique

25:33.059 --> 25:34.788
and your landing is soft enough.

25:34.861 --> 25:37.261
But after rooting around
in three random dumpsters,

25:37.330 --> 25:39.264
we've failed to find them

25:39.332 --> 25:42.495
consistently full of soft-enough
stuff for a safe landing.

25:42.568 --> 25:43.967
Ow.

25:44.036 --> 25:46.698
However, after some scale tests
here in the shop,

25:46.772 --> 25:50.173
we have chosen an ideal material
to fill our dumpster with,

25:50.243 --> 25:51.471
and soon we're gonna find out

25:51.544 --> 25:54.172
if you can survive a fall
into this.

25:55.515 --> 25:57.813
We know it's safe
to fall into an air bag,

25:57.884 --> 26:00.978
but we don't know whether it's
safe to fall into a dumpster.

26:01.053 --> 26:02.748
That's where Buster comes in.

26:03.890 --> 26:04.914
But wait!

26:04.991 --> 26:07.084
We're not at that point
in the story yet.

26:07.159 --> 26:08.888
First we need a safety control.

26:08.961 --> 26:12.158
Which is why we're putting
accelerometers all over Buster.

26:12.231 --> 26:14.290
These accelerometers
will yield for us

26:14.367 --> 26:17.029
a graphical representation
of Buster's deceleration

26:17.103 --> 26:18.365
into the air bag.

26:18.437 --> 26:20.029
And it is this graph
against which

26:20.106 --> 26:22.870
we'll compare Buster's dumpster
dive to make sure it's safe.

26:22.942 --> 26:24.967
<i>Buster's living up
to his name</i>

26:25.044 --> 26:26.739
as a "trash-test" dummy...

26:26.812 --> 26:28.074
Now, I have a plan.

26:28.147 --> 26:30.513
...by finding out
the deceleration

26:30.583 --> 26:32.210
of a safe fall into an air bag.

26:32.285 --> 26:35.448
Thank goodness he's got an innie
and not an outie, huh?

26:35.521 --> 26:38.081
Then they'll compare
the accelerometer data

26:38.157 --> 26:40.625
with his dive
into a dumpster full of foam.

26:40.693 --> 26:42.718
And with the accelerometers
in position,

26:42.795 --> 26:46.629
Buster is hoisted to 20 feet
to take his dive.

26:46.699 --> 26:47.893
You ready for this?

26:47.967 --> 26:49.195
Ready when you are.

26:49.268 --> 26:50.565
All right.

26:50.636 --> 26:53.104
Okay. Safety control...
dummy into air bag.

26:53.172 --> 26:55.140
3, 2, 1.

26:58.044 --> 26:59.671
A perfect 10!

26:59.745 --> 27:00.677
Works for me.

27:00.746 --> 27:01.872
Nice work, Buster!

27:03.249 --> 27:05.012
Okay.
Go ahead and hook her up.

27:05.084 --> 27:06.881
Let's see what we got.

27:06.953 --> 27:10.582
And it figures
that the figures are good.

27:10.656 --> 27:12.351
The accelerometers
worked like a charm,

27:12.425 --> 27:16.589
and this graph right here
is a safe drop into the air bag.

27:16.662 --> 27:18.789
Let's hope we get the same thing
out of the dumpster, huh?

27:18.864 --> 27:20.229
Yeah.

27:20.299 --> 27:24.929
Yep, now the Mythbusters have
the data for a safe landing.

27:25.004 --> 27:27.700
Buster registered 11.4 G's
on that test.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.673
A "G" is one Earth's gravity,

27:29.742 --> 27:33.178
so that means that Buster
weighed 11.4 times as much

27:33.245 --> 27:36.146
as he normally does
when the air bag stopped him.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.615
Now, we know that you can
get up and walk away

27:38.684 --> 27:39.742
from a jump like that.

27:39.819 --> 27:42.481
What we need to know now
is how this compares

27:42.555 --> 27:44.455
to our best-case scenario...

27:44.523 --> 27:47.492
jumping into a dumpster
full of foam.

27:49.895 --> 27:51.123
This is our dumpster.

27:51.197 --> 27:53.529
It's empty right now,
but soon we're gonna fill it

27:53.599 --> 27:56.227
full of the softest stuff
that we've been able to find,

27:56.302 --> 28:00.534
and Buster's gonna jump into it
to make sure it's okay for us.

28:02.708 --> 28:04.266
R2! I need you to shut down

28:04.343 --> 28:06.607
all the compactors
on the detention level!

28:12.551 --> 28:14.485
If you've got to jump
into a dumpster,

28:14.553 --> 28:16.384
this right here
would be you'd call

28:16.455 --> 28:19.390
a best-case real world scenario.

28:19.458 --> 28:21.153
<i>But is it a best-case scenario</i>

28:21.227 --> 28:22.819
that you could walk away from?

28:22.895 --> 28:25.955
If Buster doesn't survive
a fall into this,

28:26.032 --> 28:27.363
this movie myth is busted.

28:28.501 --> 28:30.628
Data collection...
dummy into foam.

28:30.703 --> 28:32.568
In 3, 2, 1!

28:36.809 --> 28:38.299
That looks like
it's viable.

28:38.377 --> 28:42.643
And a closer look at the data
backs Adam up.

28:42.715 --> 28:45.616
The foam resulted
in 9.9 G's.

28:45.685 --> 28:46.447
Wow.

28:46.519 --> 28:48.316
It's effectively the same,

28:48.387 --> 28:50.514
even a little more gentle
with the foam.

28:50.589 --> 28:52.079
Yep, from 20 feet,

28:52.158 --> 28:55.889
Buster's impact into the foam
was 1.5 G's fewer

28:55.961 --> 28:57.895
than his fall into the air bag,

28:57.963 --> 29:00.363
meaning that the foam
actually worked better

29:00.433 --> 29:04.995
to maximize his deceleration
and keep him from injury.

29:05.071 --> 29:06.834
I'm pretty impressed
with the foam.

29:06.906 --> 29:08.840
I'd say that
that is a survivable fall.

29:08.908 --> 29:11.274
Maybe even comfortable,
and the data backs it up.

29:11.343 --> 29:14.141
Can I be the one to do the jump?
Can I do the jump in here?

29:14.213 --> 29:16.738
You don't have some kind
of a costume, do you?

29:16.816 --> 29:17.783
Yeah, I do.

29:17.850 --> 29:18.942
I thought so.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.007
Can I do it?!

29:20.086 --> 29:21.451
Knock yourself out.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.009
Yes!

29:24.056 --> 29:25.523
All right.
Camera mounts, check.

29:25.591 --> 29:27.616
Diving-helmet mounts, check.

29:27.693 --> 29:29.558
300 foot umbilical, check.

29:29.628 --> 29:30.925
Dive suit, check.

29:30.996 --> 29:32.463
Helmet, check.

29:32.531 --> 29:35.159
And finally,
Meat Man is done.

29:35.234 --> 29:37.794
Now it's time to take all these
things out to the ocean,

29:37.870 --> 29:39.633
take 'em down 300 feet,

29:39.705 --> 29:44.233
and find out whether or not
Meat Man will get the squeeze.

29:44.310 --> 29:47.302
<i>So to do that,
it's off to Santa Cruz Harbor,</i>

29:47.379 --> 29:49.540
where the experts
from North Coast Divers

29:49.615 --> 29:51.708
will take them out to sea.

29:51.784 --> 29:52.876
So, are we good to go?

29:52.952 --> 29:54.544
We are.
Conditions are perfect.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.281
<i>But before they test the waters,</i>

29:56.355 --> 30:00.724
the Wizard of Odd
has to give Meat Man a heart.

30:00.793 --> 30:02.920
Since the chest is the only
thing that is compressible

30:02.995 --> 30:04.929
on a human being,
especially in this experiment,

30:04.997 --> 30:07.227
it's important we have something
inside the chest cavity.

30:07.299 --> 30:08.857
Right now, it's hollow.

30:08.934 --> 30:12.529
So what we need to do is fill
him up with some kind of organs,

30:12.605 --> 30:15.039
guts, blood, so that way,
if we do get that squeeze,

30:15.107 --> 30:17.701
we'll be able to see it
come shooting into the helmet.

30:17.777 --> 30:20.143
So I have some hearts.
I got some livers.

30:20.212 --> 30:21.304
I have some fake blood.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.314
I'm gonna fill up this chest,
sew him back up,

30:23.382 --> 30:24.781
and we can get him
into the suit.

30:26.085 --> 30:29.418
I have no idea what that is,
but it's going in.

30:29.488 --> 30:35.916
<i>Meat Man really puts
the "meat" in "team. "</i>

30:35.995 --> 30:38.486
Finally, it's out
to the open ocean,

30:38.564 --> 30:40.896
with Meat Man
safe inside his suit...

30:40.966 --> 30:43.696
at least for now.

30:43.769 --> 30:46.363
If you see any sharks,
play dead.

30:46.438 --> 30:48.372
And once they're in
deep enough water...

30:48.440 --> 30:50.738
Jim, how are we doing?
Are we almost there?

30:50.810 --> 30:52.437
We're in 300 feet of water
right now.

30:52.511 --> 30:54.172
We've got lots of deep water
behind us

30:54.246 --> 30:56.476
when we drift that way.

30:56.549 --> 30:57.481
We're ready to go.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.916
...preparation for launch
begins.

30:59.985 --> 31:02.283
Yeah. Beauty.

31:02.354 --> 31:04.345
Now, it's not as simple

31:04.423 --> 31:06.550
as just hanging Meat Man
over the side of the boat

31:06.625 --> 31:08.354
and letting him drop
to 300 feet.

31:08.427 --> 31:09.587
As he makes his descent,

31:09.662 --> 31:11.493
the pressure
pushing in on the suit

31:11.564 --> 31:15.364
goes up by. 445 psi
every foot.

31:15.434 --> 31:17.231
So in order to compensate
for that,

31:17.303 --> 31:20.466
I'm gonna have to add air in
through this hose

31:20.539 --> 31:21.938
and push back out.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.099
Now, I've calibrated this gauge

31:23.175 --> 31:26.838
to the appro ximate psi
that I need versus the depth.

31:26.912 --> 31:29.676
Okay, so we're not relying
completely on Grant's math.

31:29.748 --> 31:31.648
We have a live-video feed
from an ROV

31:31.717 --> 31:33.617
that's gonna be
traveling around the cage,

31:33.686 --> 31:36.416
and we also have a live link
from a camera

31:36.488 --> 31:38.718
that's already mounted
on the cage as well.

31:38.791 --> 31:40.816
So if the suit inflates
too much or too little,

31:40.893 --> 31:43.384
we should be able to see
everything very easily

31:43.462 --> 31:44.724
from sitting right here.

31:44.797 --> 31:47.493
Okay, watch those cables
over there.

31:47.566 --> 31:48.533
Hold it.

31:48.601 --> 31:49.659
Drop it.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.430
...All right, let's drop it.
Okay.

31:51.503 --> 31:55.803
And Meat Man is in the water.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.173
Bye-bye, Meat Man.

31:58.244 --> 32:01.077
Say hello
to Davy Jones.

32:05.718 --> 32:09.586
Let's go maybe 30 feet at a time
just to see what happens.

32:09.655 --> 32:12.021
<i>With cameras rolling,</i>

32:12.091 --> 32:15.117
the diver is painstakingly
lowered into the drink

32:15.194 --> 32:18.994
to, uh, "meat"
his deep-sea fate.

32:19.064 --> 32:21.089
What's your depth, Jessi?

32:21.166 --> 32:22.258
31 feet.

32:22.334 --> 32:23.767
Copy that.

32:23.836 --> 32:26.930
<i>But as they monitor
his slow descent,</i>

32:27.006 --> 32:31.170
the team is skeptical
of a full-body squeeze.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.335
I honestly think

32:32.411 --> 32:34.311
that there's gonna be
some juices flowing,

32:34.380 --> 32:36.871
but I don't think it's gonna
suck the skin off his bones.

32:36.949 --> 32:39.440
I don't think
the whole body is gonna come up.

32:39.518 --> 32:41.884
I mean, there's a lot of meat
down there.

32:41.954 --> 32:44.047
I don't think all of that's
gonna come to the helmet.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.787
If my calculations
are correct,

32:48.861 --> 32:51.386
we're almost
a third of the way down.

32:54.133 --> 32:56.033
Looks like we are right on.

32:57.736 --> 33:01.968
200 feet.

33:02.041 --> 33:04.168
<i>Two-thirds of the way down,</i>

33:04.243 --> 33:07.872
and everything is going
according to plan.

33:07.947 --> 33:09.039
How is he holding up?

33:09.114 --> 33:10.638
Yes.
Looks good so far.

33:10.716 --> 33:14.982
235 feet
and it's getting really dark,

33:15.054 --> 33:18.512
thank God we've got all those
lights all over the place.

33:18.590 --> 33:19.852
Okay. That's 300 feet.

33:19.925 --> 33:22.120
Okay.
Stop the cage.

33:22.194 --> 33:26.324
<i>At that depth, there's
135 pounds of water pressure</i>

33:26.398 --> 33:31.131
pressing on every square inch
of the diving suit.

33:31.203 --> 33:35.162
The only thing keeping the water
at bay is the compressed air.

33:35.240 --> 33:40.439
So will cutting the air supply
lead to a spectacular squeeze?

33:40.512 --> 33:44.141
There's only one way
to find out.

33:45.718 --> 33:47.242
All right, you guys.
How's the suit holding?

33:47.319 --> 33:50.152
It is looking great,
and we are at 300 feet.

33:50.222 --> 33:51.951
Yes! All right.
Let's do it. Ready?

33:52.024 --> 33:53.184
...You ready?
... Yeah.

33:53.258 --> 33:56.159
3...

33:56.228 --> 33:57.991
2...

33:58.063 --> 33:59.928
1.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.429
Moment of truth, huh?

34:03.502 --> 34:04.264
Yep.

34:04.336 --> 34:05.462
You ready?

34:05.537 --> 34:06.561
I am.

34:06.638 --> 34:08.469
Actually, it looks like
it's gonna be fun.

34:08.540 --> 34:12.032
Well, just remember,
this is about a chase scene,

34:12.110 --> 34:14.237
so when you hit the foam,
you can't just lie there.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.803
You got to get up
and take off.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.679
That's great. Absolutely.
I will do precisely that.

34:18.751 --> 34:20.411
That makes it
even more fun.

34:20.485 --> 34:22.851
More fun
and more complicated.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.889
Remember, this is
all about deceleration.

34:25.958 --> 34:28.255
The principle
is that the foam

34:28.327 --> 34:30.989
will bring Adam to a stop
gradually,

34:31.063 --> 34:33.554
meaning he comes out
injury-free.

34:33.632 --> 34:36.226
But so far,
that's just a theory.

34:36.301 --> 34:39.600
A miscalculation here
could spell disaster.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.331
Our jump height is 20 feet.

34:41.407 --> 34:43.466
Now, that may not sound
like a whole lot,

34:43.542 --> 34:45.476
but that's a two-story house.

34:45.543 --> 34:48.638
And if you jump that without
something soft to catch you,

34:48.714 --> 34:50.614
you're gonna be going so fast

34:50.681 --> 34:53.081
that you're gonna have
some serious damage.

34:54.219 --> 34:55.379
It's a long way down.

34:55.454 --> 34:57.513
And, I mean,
although we've eliminated

34:57.589 --> 34:59.819
any washing machines
or anvils in there,

34:59.892 --> 35:02.452
it is still just
a dumpster full of garbage.

35:02.528 --> 35:04.359
I mean, I've been trained,

35:04.430 --> 35:08.093
I'm no longer as scared looking
over this ledge as I once was,

35:08.167 --> 35:10.328
and the dummy says
it's gonna be safe.

35:10.402 --> 35:14.202
So there's nothing to do now
but go for broke.

35:14.273 --> 35:17.140
<i>But there's no time
to dwell on the danger,</i>

35:17.209 --> 35:18.642
'cause it's lights...

35:18.710 --> 35:20.268
Camera...

35:20.345 --> 35:23.109
And... action.

35:42.868 --> 35:46.235
Getting my gun out.

35:46.305 --> 35:49.297
Eat your heart out, Hollywood.

35:49.374 --> 35:50.773
Adam nailed the dumpster dive.

35:50.843 --> 35:53.209
And as he makes his getaway...

35:54.913 --> 35:57.040
...he'll live to see
another day.

35:59.084 --> 36:00.244
Hey.

36:00.319 --> 36:02.116
So, how are you doing?

36:02.187 --> 36:03.176
I'm doing good.

36:03.255 --> 36:04.882
Fingers all there?
Everything all right?

36:04.957 --> 36:06.481
Yeah. Little bit
of an adrenaline rush.

36:06.558 --> 36:07.684
But it worked
beautifully.

36:07.759 --> 36:09.420
It's actually a lot softer
than the air bag.

36:09.495 --> 36:10.928
...Nice work.
... Thank you.

36:12.631 --> 36:16.897
And that, as they say,
is a wrap.

36:16.969 --> 36:19.995
Well, I think the call
on this one is pretty clear.

36:20.072 --> 36:21.300
Yep.
It's plausible.

36:21.373 --> 36:24.240
As long as the contents
of the dumpster are soft enough.

36:24.309 --> 36:25.367
The thing is,

36:25.444 --> 36:27.412
you're not gonna really know
what's in there

36:27.479 --> 36:29.777
until it's too late.
... Until it's way too late.

36:29.848 --> 36:31.782
Plausible,
but not recommended.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.909
Let's get out of here.

36:38.957 --> 36:40.390
You're good
at dumpster diving,

36:40.459 --> 36:42.154
but not so good
with the scissor lift.

36:47.599 --> 36:50.466
Five miles
off the coast of California,

36:50.536 --> 36:53.664
a very strange occurrence
is going down.

36:53.739 --> 36:55.969
We are about to find out
whether or not

36:56.041 --> 36:58.066
this deep-sea diving myth
is true or not.

36:58.143 --> 37:01.044
Ever since I heard this story,
I was like, "How crazy is this?"

37:01.113 --> 37:02.842
This deep-sea diver
is down 300 feet.

37:02.915 --> 37:05.076
He loses the pressure
in his suit,

37:05.150 --> 37:07.846
and he actually gets squeezed
and sucked up into his helmet.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.889
<i>The Mythbusters
have lowered their diver</i>

37:10.956 --> 37:13.516
into the murky deep...

37:13.592 --> 37:14.854
200 feet.

37:14.927 --> 37:17.896
...making sure that
the air pressure inside the suit

37:17.963 --> 37:20.625
is equal to the water pressure
surrounding it.

37:20.699 --> 37:26.569
We are exactly 50 feet away
from our final destination.

37:26.638 --> 37:30.074
<i>But that's all about to change.</i>

37:30.142 --> 37:31.939
Okay. That's 300 feet.

37:32.010 --> 37:33.637
Okay.
Stop the cage.

37:33.712 --> 37:37.148
You guys ready to cut the line
and see what happens?

37:37.216 --> 37:38.911
Yeah.

37:38.984 --> 37:40.383
Ready in 3...

37:40.452 --> 37:42.477
2...

37:42.554 --> 37:44.818
1.

37:46.058 --> 37:48.583
There it goes!

37:48.660 --> 37:50.560
He's starting
to squeeze.

37:53.999 --> 37:54.863
Look at that!

37:54.933 --> 37:56.992
Oh, my God!

37:58.437 --> 37:59.802
Wait a minute.
Whoa!

37:59.871 --> 38:01.532
Look at what's happening
to his head!

38:01.607 --> 38:05.441
Oh, my God!
His head is... oh!

38:05.510 --> 38:06.772
Yeah!

38:06.845 --> 38:09.780
Oh!

38:09.848 --> 38:12.043
Meat Man is
in the helmet!

38:12.117 --> 38:14.108
That's crazy!

38:14.186 --> 38:15.244
...Yeah!
... Yeah!

38:15.320 --> 38:16.287
It worked!

38:18.991 --> 38:21.516
Oh, my gosh!

38:21.593 --> 38:23.788
<i>Yep, the effect of the cut hose</i>

38:23.862 --> 38:25.295
was less than instantaneous.

38:25.364 --> 38:27.764
But once the air pressure was
exhausted, physics took over,

38:27.833 --> 38:31.860
and the drastic
pressure differential

38:31.937 --> 38:36.169
pushed Meat Man into his helmet,
exactly as the myth predicted.

38:36.241 --> 38:38.641
I don't even think
we need to bring him up.

38:38.710 --> 38:39.642
...No.
... No.

38:39.711 --> 38:40.643
Just leave him down there!

38:40.712 --> 38:41.804
Wow!

38:41.880 --> 38:42.972
Look at that.

38:43.048 --> 38:45.380
Look at those side glasses.
Look at that.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.508
That's amazing.

38:46.585 --> 38:47.950
You can't even see
in the helmet anymore

38:48.020 --> 38:50.488
'cause it's covered with flesh
and blood.

38:50.555 --> 38:52.580
Who's gonna clean
the suit?

38:52.658 --> 38:54.057
Not it.

38:54.126 --> 38:57.095
<i>And a closer
inspection of our diver</i>

38:57.162 --> 38:58.424
reveals the kind of damage

38:58.497 --> 39:03.127
135 pounds of pressure
per square inch can do.

39:03.201 --> 39:06.602
Oh, wow!

39:06.672 --> 39:08.196
Oh, my God!

39:08.273 --> 39:09.205
Stop!

39:09.274 --> 39:12.107
We totally
caved the helmet in!

39:12.177 --> 39:14.077
Look at all the guts
in there.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.546
His stomach
is inside his helmet.

39:17.616 --> 39:19.948
Just by the side of the helmet.

39:20.018 --> 39:21.610
...Look at that!
... Dude.

39:21.687 --> 39:23.314
Could you imagine
that pressure?

39:23.388 --> 39:26.152
That is absolutely confirmed.
No doubt about it.

39:26.224 --> 39:27.521
Totally confirmed.

39:27.592 --> 39:30.322
Okay, so I definitely expected
the juices to be flowing,

39:30.395 --> 39:32.522
but I didn't expect
to see them, like,

39:32.597 --> 39:34.497
slowly rise up
through the helmet

39:34.566 --> 39:36.466
and then... pow!...
where everything...

39:36.535 --> 39:38.730
it was just like an explosion
inside the suit.

39:38.804 --> 39:43.002
Completely unexpected
but totally awesome.

39:43.075 --> 39:45.066
Now, the name of this game
is differential pressure.

39:46.278 --> 39:48.246
They can withstand
a huge amount of pressure

39:48.313 --> 39:50.338
when they're equalized.

39:50.415 --> 39:53.145
But the second you take away all
the pressure on the inside...

39:54.286 --> 39:55.014
...crush.

39:55.087 --> 39:58.056
You can see this is what's left.

39:58.123 --> 39:59.988
I saw it with my own eyes.

40:00.058 --> 40:02.583
I still can't believe
that this actually happened.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.629
This one is completely
confirmed.

40:04.696 --> 40:07.665
I'm sorry, Meat Man,
but it was totally worth it!

40:07.733 --> 40:09.997
You guys ready
to get out of here?

40:10.068 --> 40:11.365
Yeah. Let's go home.

40:11.436 --> 40:13.904
All right, Jim!
Take us home!
