- Are the police there?
- Yeah.

They're here too. They hit
Spencer's apartment first.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.449

really terrible things.

I need signatures

in the trunk,
and my release isn't working

01:10.370 --> 01:11.598

of mine who has another

almost here

you have to understand--

Understand what, Spencer?

That she's screwed up?

That she got scared

have checked the trunk'

with you in the back.

have just let that cop find you.

Maybe I still can.

'I could tell them
that I killed you.‘

gonna happen all over again.

it's gonna be homes

10:26.890 --> 10:28.039
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.183
- I have to do this.
- Do what?

10:30.220 --> 10:32.780
I can make it up to them,
I can take the blame.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.559
First of all, I'm-I'm not
interested in you making

10:34.600 --> 10:36.352
any more sacrifices
for your friends.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.267
Second, Aria, you have an alibi,
you're in the clear.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.758
There's nothing linking you
to what happened with Dunhill.

in the trunk of my car.

10:45.310 --> 10:48.234

10:57.950 --> 10:59.781
Emily and Alison
didn't pick up.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.014
She's still in there?

11:01.060 --> 11:03.278
She's still
waiting for somebody.

(Caleb)
'Makes me wonder
who she's waiting for.'

11:20.640 --> 11:23.029
- Is she alone?
- She's all by herself.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.446
I think we need to get in there
before she gets any support.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.504
If we do that,
how do we find out

11:26.550 --> 11:27.699
who she was supposed to meet?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.115
She was supposed to meet
Charlotte here.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.539
Remember? "The Two Crows?"

11:31.590 --> 11:32.989
The night Charlotte was killed

11:33.020 --> 11:34.783
Mona called her,
and Charlotte never showed up.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.754
She's not gonna show up tonight.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.052
I'm just saying
that's what she said.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.626
I know what she said,
it's her alibi.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.150
Maybe Mona is not A.D.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.350
Maybe she moved the game to keep
the police from finding it.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.129
- I can't buy that.
- Because you don't want to.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.660
Oh, my God, you guys are arguing

11:46.700 --> 11:48.839
like you're married
or something.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.859
What?

11:54.110 --> 11:55.737
Hey, did you call
All and Em up?

11:55.780 --> 11:57.907
No, they didn't pick up.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.841
- Spencer, 1--
- Ijust talked to Mary.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.575
- What?
- I talked to Mary.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.973
- I saw her.
- When?

12:05.020 --> 12:09.081
Tonight,
and she gave me the Lost Woods.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.009
- She gave you a motel?
- Yeah, Ali and me.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.721
Why?

12:13.760 --> 12:14.988
I think I'm supposed
to mortgage it

12:15.030 --> 12:16.918
to pay for the lawyers
that we're gonna need.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.860
- Oh, my God.
- Look, maybe Caleb's right.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.221
Maybe we should just grab Mona
while we can.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.467
Did he go back
to the car or something?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.774
Spencer..

12:29.580 --> 12:32.504
[music continues]

12:36.620 --> 12:39.088
They got me on my knees

12:39.120 --> 12:42.578
Down on this cave floor

12:42.620 --> 12:44.759
Don't you like your pie?

12:45.730 --> 12:47.254
It's okay.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.252
Do you mind?

13:01.940 --> 13:04.477
[music continues]

13:06.950 --> 13:09.077
Who you waiting for?

13:12.990 --> 13:14.787
Let's go for
a little ride, then.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.459
I don't think I wanna go
anywhere with you.

13:17.490 --> 13:18.889
Well, think again.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.158
'Because we're gonna
walk out of here'

13:20.190 --> 13:21.919
and we're gonna go
to the police.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.052
You're gonna tell them
how you made

13:23.100 --> 13:25.091
everybody's life a living hell.

13:25.130 --> 13:28.327
But first,
we're gonna pick up the game

13:28.370 --> 13:30.497
just so they can see
your handy work.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.335
I don't have it anymore.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.638
Somebody stole it from me

13:36.680 --> 13:37.908
somebody's always stealing

13:37.950 --> 13:39.906
the game from me.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.679
If you don't have it, who does?

13:44.720 --> 13:46.187
I don't know.

13:46.220 --> 13:49.018
Somebody's always stealing
the game from me.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.929
I told Hanna, it was a bad idea

13:53.960 --> 13:56.258
my touching that thing.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.799
We're out of our league

14:00.840 --> 14:02.535
all of us.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.492
We swim around in this fish bowl

14:04.540 --> 14:05.768
like we're in control.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.368
We are not.

14:07.410 --> 14:09.605
There's always been
somebody watching.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.475
Manipulating.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.877
[music continues]

14:15.880 --> 14:18.940
This is Rosewood, Mona,
not Area 51.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.310
Finish your pie.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.885
I don't want anything from you.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.229
Front door's this way.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.897
Mind if I use the ladies' first?

14:35.940 --> 14:38.431
Can you hold it?

14:38.470 --> 14:40.028
- What the hell are you doing?
- Mona..

14:40.070 --> 14:42.209
I couldn't just stand there
and do nothing.

14:43.210 --> 14:46.600
They got me on my knees..

14:51.020 --> 14:52.282
Maybe she went out the back.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.639
Not without setting off
the alarm.

14:53.690 --> 14:56.158
Well, she didn't just
flush herself out.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.050
Guys.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.767
They got me on my knees

15:05.800 --> 15:08.997
Down on this cave floor

15:13.110 --> 15:15.362
That's how she got out.

15:15.410 --> 15:16.729
Yeah, maybe that's how
Mona got out

15:16.780 --> 15:19.044
the night that Charlotte
was killed.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.240
- Come on.
- No, not you.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.542
I'm not letting you down
any more holes.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.616
I'm not letting you go down
there by yourself.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.049
I'll go with him.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.409
Just take your car
back to Rosewood

15:26.450 --> 15:28.418
this has to come up
between here and town.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.916
Let the others know
what we're up to.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.587
We'll call you when we surface.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.552
Alright, don't get lost.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.597
How do you like
the ladies room?

15:42.100 --> 15:43.567
Smells nicer.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.705
[instrumental music]

15:55.820 --> 15:57.947
Get the watch commander.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.484
[instrumental music]

16:08.830 --> 16:11.048
There is nothing
keeping us here.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.397
You forgot something.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.068
The dead body
in the trunk of your car?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.260
No, I didn't forget that.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.234
The body is not the problem.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.602
Yes, okay, the body is a problem

16:19.640 --> 16:22.108
but more importantly..

16:22.140 --> 16:23.801
...I can't leave my friends.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.740
I think they gave up the right
to be your friends.

16:25.780 --> 16:29.739
No, they haven't. I'm the one
who made the bad choice.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.044
When someone puts you in a box
and nails the lid shut

16:32.090 --> 16:35.184
part of you will always be
locked in that box in the dark

16:35.220 --> 16:37.415
afraid and crying, but..

16:37.460 --> 16:40.486
...you can't let that trap part
do the thinking for you.

16:42.230 --> 16:45.449
[sighs]
Okay, we can grab the others

16:45.500 --> 16:46.797
we can get out of Tanner's
jurisdiction

16:46.830 --> 16:50.436
there's no point in
making this easier for her.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.439
First we need_ to deal with that
problem In your trunk.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.036
How?

16:59.150 --> 17:02.347
I have a masters degree
in American literature.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.519
There is nothing I can't handle.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.987
[door opens]

17:10.020 --> 17:12.727
[instrumental music]

17:12.760 --> 17:14.387
Oh, no.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.526
[Aria sighs]

[dramatic music]

17:25.770 --> 17:28.466
[indistinct chattering]

17:31.950 --> 17:33.406
[door opens]

17:35.650 --> 17:38.141
He's coming for you.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.782
We have to go.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.311
NOW, All.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.658
Ali, we came back for you,
so move it.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.153
It's too late,
he's already here.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.431
[dramatic music]

18:03.310 --> 18:05.175
[banging on door]

18:06.380 --> 18:08.245
He's awfully sprightly
for a dead guy.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.339
You know, maybe if you'd hit him
harder the first time.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.042
Guys, less talking,
more stacking.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.897
[screaming]

18:22.930 --> 18:25.728
[gasping]

18:25.770 --> 18:27.567
Ali!

18:27.600 --> 18:28.862
[gaSPS]

18:31.470 --> 18:32.732
Mm.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.032
[sighs]

18:38.080 --> 18:40.571
Ali. Ali.

18:40.610 --> 18:42.202
What happened?

18:42.250 --> 18:44.445
You fell asleep, so did I.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.788
What do you mean?
How did we both fall asleep?

18:46.820 --> 18:48.685
I don't know, but we did.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.551
(automated message)
'We don't have a lot of time.‘

18:50.590 --> 18:52.387
'We don't have a lot of time.‘

18:52.430 --> 18:54.057
'We don't have a lot of time.‘

18:54.090 --> 18:55.990
'We don't have a lot of time.
We don't have a lot of time.‘

18:56.030 --> 18:57.918
'We don't have a lot of time.‘

18:57.970 --> 18:59.824
We don't have a lot of time.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.269
We don't have a lot of time.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.461
- Please shut if off.
- 'We don't have a lot of time.‘

19:03.500 --> 19:05.639
'We don't have a lot of time.‘

19:07.170 --> 19:09.274
That's it. We're getting out.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.278
[pounding on door]

19:11.310 --> 19:12.607
The police.

19:12.650 --> 19:16.211
- 'Ali, Emily. Open the door.‘
- Oh, my..

19:16.250 --> 19:18.571
(Caleb)
Mona said she doesn't have
the game anymore.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.043
- She said that to you?
- She said somebody stole it.

19:21.090 --> 19:24.082
- What if Mona's A.D. then--
- I don't know about that now.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.314
Why, what changed her mind?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.954
I don't know.
How scared she was.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.627
The note telling her to get out.

19:29.660 --> 19:33.266
A.D. doesn't get messages,
they send messages.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.791
- Poor Mona.
- What did you just say?

19:36.840 --> 19:39.604
She always wanted to be
in charge of everything.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.677
She ends up middle management.
That's gotta hurt.

19:47.210 --> 19:50.111
Hanna and I are married.

19:50.150 --> 19:52.118
You mean you're going
to get married?

19:52.150 --> 19:54.539
No, I mean we're married.

19:54.590 --> 19:58.185
- What, since when?
- Since tonight.

19:58.230 --> 20:02.018
Oh, no wonder you didn't want
her going down any more holes.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.290
Congratulations.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.366
Thanks.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.958
There is a part of me,
though, that, uh

20:08.000 --> 20:10.195
wants to say I'm sorry.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.491
To whom?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.462
Well, to the only person I know

20:13.510 --> 20:15.728
who uses "Whom"
In a conversation.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.476
Sorry to me? For what?

20:21.580 --> 20:24.640
Don't you dare apologize
for being with me.

20:24.690 --> 20:28.239
And don't you dare forget it,
any of it.

20:29.190 --> 20:30.657
'Cause I won't.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.657
- "To whom?"
- Shut up.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.658
No one's answering.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.691
Hanna, Spencer, Caleb, no one.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.265
Keep trying, we need
to pick a place to meet.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.834
I'm sorry, Aria.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.698
We all are.

20:53.550 --> 20:56.269
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.386
We didn't have the right
to shut you out like that.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.387
Vanishing you from the tribe.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.121
Something I would've done
in high school.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.889
You panicked.

21:08.930 --> 21:11.854
When people panic,
they go back to old behavior.

21:14.230 --> 21:16.369
[indistinct chatter]

21:16.400 --> 21:19.631
- What is it?
- I don't know.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.206
(Aria)
'Maybe this is not about us.‘

21:21.240 --> 21:23.470
I'm not interested
in finding out.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.547
God, how I hate you.

21:33.590 --> 21:36.718
[instrumental music]

21:48.240 --> 21:49.389
[cellphone beeping]

21:50.600 --> 21:52.591
This thing is useless.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.564
You couldn't get a signal out
of here with a satellite phone.

22:07.290 --> 22:09.815
[intense music]

22:22.000 --> 22:23.695
Mona?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.376
Who else would it be?

22:31.410 --> 22:33.674
What are you doing here?

22:33.710 --> 22:35.871
Waiting for you, Charlotte.

22:37.420 --> 22:40.719
I'm not Charlotte, I'm Hanna.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.115
Mm-mm.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.458
Hanna wasn't here.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.924
Charlotte was.

22:46.960 --> 22:50.123
The night
Charlotte was released?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.128
The night you called her?

22:54.870 --> 22:57.498
Why would she want
to meet you here?

22:57.540 --> 23:00.031
Because she had to.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.402
(Charlotte)
'You brought flowers?‘

23:03.610 --> 23:05.237
Is that why you wanted
to see me?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.498
To welcome me home with flowers?

23:07.550 --> 23:09.643
I couldn't give them to you
in the hospital.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.341
Alison wouldn't let me.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.381
Why did you want to visit me?

23:13.420 --> 23:15.217
The same reason you came here.

23:15.260 --> 23:18.479
To see if there was anything
to worry about.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.829
I didn't visit,
but I kept an eye on you.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.851
I watched for five years.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.666
Five years of you making
the doctors feel

23:27.700 --> 23:31.192
so clever with all the progress
you were making.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.037
You played them all.

23:33.070 --> 23:37.200
The court, the lawyers,
your own sister.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.708
But you couldn't fool me.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.344
You always were the smart one,
Mona, not Spencer.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.847
Now, you're out, and you think

23:43.880 --> 23:45.438
you can start
hurting people again?

23:45.490 --> 23:47.708
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.184
Who's gonna stop me, is it you?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.427
Yes.

23:55.130 --> 23:58.452
Do you still see her
when you look in the mirror?

23:58.500 --> 24:00.525
The, uh, the loser

24:00.570 --> 24:03.539
'the pigtails
and the frumpy sweaters.‘

24:03.570 --> 24:05.128
'Cause I see her.

24:08.410 --> 24:10.799
I see her right now.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.549
None of you are sure
when you look in the mirror.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.879
None of you are really certain
who you are.

24:20.420 --> 24:21.887
[whispers]
I did that.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.659
I took that away from you

24:25.690 --> 24:28.818
the same way
everything was stolen from me.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.722
And now I'm back.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.125
And everything
that happened before.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.561
[chuckles]

24:36.600 --> 24:38.739
That's gonna feel like a picnic.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.938
I won't let you do that
to my friends.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.645
Oh, no one's gonna believe you.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.274
'Not only did you lose the game'

24:50.320 --> 24:52.242
but you lost the story.

24:52.290 --> 24:55.441
It's mine, everything is mine.

24:55.490 --> 24:56.957
[chuckles]

24:59.260 --> 25:01.080
God, I hate this town.

25:01.130 --> 25:03.826
I guess I'm gonna have to do
something about that too.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.434
Am I supposed to be afraid
of you?

25:15.480 --> 25:17.607
You said_no one would
believe me.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.370
Oh, sweet Mona.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.571
You don't have the guts.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.016
Let's find out.

25:28.690 --> 25:33.150
People will think you committed
suicide your first night home.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.657
How's that?

25:36.930 --> 25:38.454
Jump.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.229
Jump or I'll push you.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.262
I'm giving you more of a chance

25:43.300 --> 25:45.564
than you ever gave any of us.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.538
Maybe you'll land just right
and live.

25:50.580 --> 25:54.573
A few broken bones and you get
to me send me to prison.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.247
It's possible.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.214
You're thinking about it.

25:58.250 --> 26:01.583
You're thinking about
lot of things. Aren't you?

26:03.160 --> 26:05.116
[footsteps approaching]

26:05.160 --> 26:07.378
You're not gonna trick me
this time.

26:07.430 --> 26:08.419
[gaSPS]

26:08.460 --> 26:10.496
Hanna! Ugh!

26:10.530 --> 26:12.327
(Mona)
Oh. Ah!

26:14.870 --> 26:17.065
Mona killed Charlotte.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.299
We're gonna take her
to the cops?

26:27.350 --> 26:30.012
No. Not in this condition.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.621
Oh, I love puzzles.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.394
We should turn her over
to the police.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.429
Not like this.

26:49.470 --> 26:50.459
She killed Charlotte

26:50.500 --> 26:51.489
and she tried to kill Hanna.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.768
She didn't know who I was.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.437
I'm not turning her over
to Tanner like this.

26:54.470 --> 26:57.075
Some enhanced interrogation
and Mona could be gone forever.

26:57.110 --> 26:59.908
That may have already happened.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.349
Why is she dressed like that?

27:01.380 --> 27:03.245
She went back to a safe place.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.043
'The one place before
everything went wrong'

27:05.090 --> 27:06.546
where the worst she had to
worry about was you being mean

27:06.590 --> 27:08.546
to her in the cafeteria.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.353
We could call Dr. Sullivan.

27:10.390 --> 27:13.359
She should take Mona
to the police, she can explain.

27:13.390 --> 27:14.721
It's a good idea.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.091
[door opens]

27:17.430 --> 27:19.898
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I put it in cabin one.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.363
Emily is watching it.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.834
Can you stay here with Ezra
and watch Mona?

27:25.340 --> 27:26.807
Sure.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.743
Does that mean we won?

27:39.090 --> 27:40.682
We got those pieces
after Hanna found out

27:40.720 --> 27:43.280
that Mona killed Charlotte.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.185
[beeping]

27:45.230 --> 27:47.289
[drumroll]

27:54.130 --> 27:57.588
Whatever Tanner has,
she doesn't have the body.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.665
Then where is it?

28:12.250 --> 28:14.309
(Hanna)
'What is it,
a flipping cartoon?‘

28:14.350 --> 28:16.318
It's augmented reality.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.282
Not really the answer.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.799
- "'Aunt Carol."'
- My aunt Carol?

28:27.830 --> 28:29.798
We've been all over that place.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.263
Where would you hide
a body there?

28:32.310 --> 28:34.301
[dramatic music]

28:43.850 --> 28:46.045
Take a symbolic grave
and make it a real one.

28:46.090 --> 28:48.911
- Points for irony.
- Points for being really sick.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.417
We get him out of there, we get
rid of him, and that's it.

28:53.690 --> 28:57.296
Guys, guys. Just wait a minute.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.059
Wait for what?

28:59.100 --> 29:01.489
Do we really wanna do this?

29:01.540 --> 29:04.464
Nobody want's to do it, Aria,
but we have to.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.707
- Do we?_
- What are you talking about?

29:06.740 --> 29:09.334
I can't do this anymore.
I've had enough.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.405
Every single time we do this
only graves

29:11.440 --> 29:12.577
that get dug are ours.

29:12.610 --> 29:14.874
- What are we supposed to do?
- Walk away.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.342
Leave Archer Dunhill
to the worms.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.917
Don't we have to be sure
that he's down there?

29:18.950 --> 29:20.212
Well, what do we do
if he isn't?

29:20.250 --> 29:22.810
Don't you see? It doesn't end.

29:22.860 --> 29:26.409
If we wanna stop the crazy,
we've to stop acting crazy.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.052
Crazy and scared.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.928
She's right.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.597
If we don't walk away now,
we might as well

29:33.630 --> 29:35.393
just crawl down there with him.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.896
Are you serious?

29:38.970 --> 29:41.438
If we don't walk away,
we'll end up just like Mona.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.908

[instrumental music]

30:30.290 --> 30:32.417
You ladies need any help?

30:46.440 --> 30:48.806
Ezra and Caleb
are gonna wonder what happened

30:48.840 --> 30:51.775
they're gonna start
looking for us.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.778
Won't be hard to find us.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.608
Guys, what are we gonna do?

30:56.650 --> 30:57.969
Tell the truth.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.039
How will telling the truth now
would get us off?

31:04.060 --> 31:06.119
We're not gonna get off.

31:07.730 --> 31:09.357
So, this is it?

31:11.230 --> 31:13.391
Well, maybe when they hear Mona

31:13.430 --> 31:14.328
we'll get some mercy.

31:14.370 --> 31:15.689
Police aren't interested
In mercy

31:15.740 --> 31:17.037
they want justice.

31:17.070 --> 31:20.369
Yeah. And justice
is a blindfolded bitch.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.842
The body at the farm has been
tentatively identified

31:28.880 --> 31:30.472
as Archer Dunhill.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.042
Make yourselves comfortable

31:33.090 --> 31:34.443
there's something I have to do

31:34.490 --> 31:36.515
and then...we'll talk.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.751
"Make yourselves comfortable?"

31:40.790 --> 31:42.519
God, she's a riot.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.822
What is she doing here?

31:47.870 --> 31:49.064
I don't know.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.637
[instrumental music]

31:57.080 --> 31:59.537
I have the typed copy
of your statement.

31:59.580 --> 32:02.549
I'd like to go over
the major points one more time.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.672
Of course.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.172
Well..

32:06.220 --> 32:08.643
...I killed Archer Dunhill.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.487
'I ran him over with a car
that I stole'

32:10.520 --> 32:13.648
'and I buried his body
in the woods.‘

32:13.690 --> 32:16.227
Later I moved it to_wh_ere
I told you you'd ﬁnd It.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.399
Why'd you kill Dunhill?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.869
He was not a good man.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.868
'He tricked me into helping him'

32:24.900 --> 32:27.061
'steal from my own family.‘

32:27.110 --> 32:28.429
'He was an imposter.‘

32:28.480 --> 32:31.199
'And he was planning
to kill my niece.‘

32:32.450 --> 32:33.747
He told me if I'd try
to stop him

32:33.780 --> 32:34.769
that he would tell the police

32:34.810 --> 32:37.142
that I killed my sister.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.717
Did you murder
Jessica DiLaurentis?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.548
Yes.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.129
'That's how Dunhill
made me do things.‘

32:50.160 --> 32:51.957
'I had to kill him.'

32:52.000 --> 32:54.366
Then I tried to cover it up.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.492
How?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.130
I arranged with someone

32:58.170 --> 33:01.230
'to make it look like
Dunhill was still alive.'

33:02.340 --> 33:04.001
(Linda)
'Who was your accomplice?‘

33:04.040 --> 33:05.302
[Mary sighs]

33:05.350 --> 33:06.908
(Mary)
'I'm not gonna tell you.‘

33:06.950 --> 33:08.599
'That person had no idea
what I'd done.‘

33:08.650 --> 33:10.140
'The only thing
that they were guilty of'

33:10.180 --> 33:12.876
'was helping someone
in trouble.‘

33:12.920 --> 33:15.081
(Linda)
'Do you know why
your niece and her friends'

33:15.120 --> 33:17.816
'were at that farm tonight?‘

33:17.860 --> 33:20.124
(Mary)_
'They must have ﬁgured out
it was me.‘

33:20.160 --> 33:22.651
You were getting ready
to accuse them.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.725
They had to do something.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.467
Please..

33:29.470 --> 33:32.132
...read over
your statement carefully

33:32.170 --> 33:33.728
correct any mistakes.

33:35.010 --> 33:36.136
Thank you.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.308
[instrumental music]

33:48.150 --> 33:49.583
You're free to go.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.111
'I am sorry
for any inconvenience.‘

33:52.160 --> 33:53.479
What?

33:53.530 --> 33:55.885
Mary Drake confessed
to killing Archer Dunhill

33:55.930 --> 33:57.750
and her own sister.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.995
'Her statement is full
of credible details'

34:00.030 --> 34:02.169
'about getting the car repaired'

34:02.200 --> 34:04.031
'and taking a shower
in Spencer's barn'

34:04.070 --> 34:05.389
which accounts for

34:05.440 --> 34:07.635
blood evidence
and glass fragments.

34:09.110 --> 34:11.908
So you're just gonna let us go?

34:11.950 --> 34:14.748
Well, you haven't done
anything wrong.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.077
Have you?

34:18.420 --> 34:22.140
You used to think so
up untII recently.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.784
The district attorney
is a simple man.

34:24.820 --> 34:29.154
And he likes his cases drawn
in bold, straight lines.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.497
'I can give him Mary Drake'

34:31.530 --> 34:34.328
'and a logical story
about her and Dunhill'

34:34.370 --> 34:37.237
or I can give him a box
of loose ends with theories

34:37.270 --> 34:39.830
that might be true..

34:39.870 --> 34:41.804
...but no one could ever prove.

34:43.110 --> 34:45.271
I know which version he wants.

34:48.110 --> 34:50.249
Do you believe Mary?

34:50.280 --> 34:52.214
I am convinced
that Mary Drake is guilty

34:52.250 --> 34:54.639
of at least one homicide.

34:54.690 --> 34:56.749
She did kill her sister.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.815
And that's enough to send her
where she can hurt

34:58.860 --> 35:00.555
no one ever again.

35:01.860 --> 35:04.351
Do you believe that she killed
Archer Dunhill?

35:05.770 --> 35:07.761
What I believe

35:07.800 --> 35:09.392
and what I can prove

35:09.440 --> 35:11.135
are two different things.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.468
[instrumental music]

35:14.070 --> 35:15.367
Go home.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.799
You're not criminals.

35:20.850 --> 35:23.068
Not really.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.849
Try and remember that.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.427
Lieutenant Tanner!

35:41.300 --> 35:43.325
I wanna talk to her, please.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.588
It is better if you don't.

35:47.810 --> 35:51.132
She did this for you.
Don't ask her to explain.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.844
[music continues]

36:17.170 --> 36:18.967
We've called Dr. Sullivan

36:19.010 --> 36:21.365
and she's gonna be here
in a few hours.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.277
You're gonna be okay.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.375
I'm sorry, Mona.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.617
For what?

36:33.390 --> 36:35.915
For showing you the game
and pulling you in.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.882
But you needed me.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.658
You don't know
what that felt like.

36:41.690 --> 36:42.952
'You needed me.‘

36:43.000 --> 36:44.695
Just like you needed me
to take care of Charlotte

36:44.730 --> 36:47.392
after all the terrible things
that she did.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.094
I'm sorry, I messed that up.

it's supposed to with me.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.632
What do you mean?

37:00.510 --> 37:02.740
(Mona)
All those plans

37:02.780 --> 37:04.145
all those lies

37:04.180 --> 37:06.478
and you end up with nothing.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.182
How does that make you feel?

"Please, Mona, don't."

is because they were looking
for something hidden.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.589
It wasn't hidden.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.427
It was right there

39:01.470 --> 39:03.290
all the time

39:03.340 --> 39:04.932
in the steeple..

39:06.840 --> 39:09.331
...waiting
for Charlotte to come.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.627
Be careful.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.638
(Alison)
It's dead.

39:38.670 --> 39:39.898
Wait, did we end the game

39:39.940 --> 39:41.202
or did Mary Drake?

39:41.240 --> 39:43.037
Mona did.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.799
When she told us
what happened to Charlotte.

39:45.850 --> 39:49.047
I don't know who did,
but it's finished.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.018
We still don't know
who did this.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.711
Well, it wasn't Mona

39:54.750 --> 39:57.150
and Mary saved us from AD.
by confessing.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.408
A.D. doesn't have
any leverage anymore

39:59.460 --> 40:01.121
they've nothing left
to threaten us with.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.685
Are you sure about that?

40:03.730 --> 40:05.857
I'm not sure about anything.

40:07.930 --> 40:10.023
That's not true.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.732
I'm sure about one thing
I'm sure about all of you.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.675
Okay, let's get out of here

40:20.710 --> 40:22.246
before things get too mushy.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.373
- Good idea.
- I agree.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.851
No I can't forget tomorrow

40:34.890 --> 40:39.190
When I think of all
my sorrow

40:39.230 --> 40:41.221
When I had you there

40:41.270 --> 40:45.764
But then I let you go

40:45.810 --> 40:48.563
And now it's only fair

40:48.610 --> 40:53.001
That I should let you know

40:53.050 --> 40:59.819
What you should know oh

41:01.420 --> 41:05.413
I can't live

41:05.460 --> 41:08.987
If living is without you

41:09.030 --> 41:12.420
I can't live

41:12.470 --> 41:16.167
I can't give anymore

41:16.200 --> 41:19.988
I can't live

41:20.040 --> 41:23.407
If living is without you

41:23.440 --> 41:26.932
I can't live

41:26.980 --> 41:31.576
I can't give anymore
