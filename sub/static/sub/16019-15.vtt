THROUGH THE WINDOW.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.145
OH, MY GOD. W-W-WHY DIDN'T YOU

01:41.977 --> 01:44.145
CALL THE COPS?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.188
I KNEW THAT WOULD BE

01:44.187 --> 01:45.188
YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.648
AS I WAS RUNNING HERE,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.233
I COULD HEAR YOU ASKING ME

01:46.690 --> 01:48.233
THAT QUESTION IN MY MIND,

01:48.275 --> 01:49.150
BUT I WAS ALREADY MOVING.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.235
W-WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU

01:49.192 --> 01:50.235
CALL US?!

YOUR SECOND QUESTION. I...

01:52.362 --> 01:53.572
I SHOULD PROBABLY

01:52.362 --> 01:53.572
GO WITH THEM.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.575

02:02.247 --> 02:04.750
I JUST CARRIED A CANDLESTICK

02:02.247 --> 02:04.750

02:04.792 --> 02:08.378
WOW. LOOK AT THOSE POTATOES.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.215
THE COPS?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.341
NO COPS. NEVER COPS.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.176

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
TOMMY! DAMN IT,

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
YOU SCARED ME.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
RELAX. IT'S JUST TOMMY,

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
MY PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.189
WHAT? YOU HAVE

02:26.271 --> 02:28.189
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?

02:28.231 --> 02:30.859
I FOUND HER, CHLOE.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.859
I FOUND TRISH.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.861
WHAT? WHO IS TRISH?

02:32.903 --> 02:36.197
THE ORIGINAL BITCH

02:32.903 --> 02:36.197

02:40.243 --> 02:41.787
CHLOE HIRED ME TO FIND A WOMAN

02:40.243 --> 02:41.787
NAMED TRISH OSBORNE.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.204
HEY, CHATTERBOX!

02:41.829 --> 02:43.204
(hits arm)

02:43.246 --> 02:45.373
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

02:43.246 --> 02:45.373
A  PRIVATE  INVESTIGATOR.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.835
WHEN CHLOE WAS 18,

02:45.415 --> 02:47.835
SHE CAME TO NEW YORK

02:47.876 --> 02:50.879
AND MOVED INTO APARTMENT 23

02:47.876 --> 02:50.879
WITH TRISH.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.214
(door creaks)

02:53.256 --> 02:54.215
HI! I'M CHLOE.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.383
SAVE IT. NO NAMES.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.011
IT'LL MAKE IT EASIER

02:55.425 --> 02:57.011
WHEN YOU LEAVE NEW YORK

02:57.052 --> 02:58.303
AND RUN BACK

02:57.052 --> 02:58.303
TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE CRYING

02:58.345 --> 03:01.890
BECAUSE THE CITY WAS

02:58.345 --> 03:01.890
TOO HARD.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.101
BUT HEY, AT LEAST

03:01.932 --> 03:04.101
THE THREE WEEKS YOU LAST HERE

03:04.143 --> 03:05.477
WILL GIVE YOU ENOUGH

03:04.143 --> 03:05.477

03:26.289 --> 03:27.916
HOW DID YOU KNOW

03:26.289 --> 03:27.916
WHEN YOU ASKED

03:27.958 --> 03:29.918
IF SOMEBODY HAD A TATTOO

03:27.958 --> 03:29.918

03:29.960 --> 03:31.252
THAT THEY WOULD SAY "YES"?

03:38.802 --> 03:40.345

03:40.387 --> 03:43.765
AND EVENTUALLY, CHLOE FELT

03:40.387 --> 03:43.765
SAFE ENOUGH TO SHARE HER DREAM.

TO BE ONE OF THE CROWD DANCERS,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.485

04:35.609 --> 04:37.485

04:37.527 --> 04:39.113
TO GET TO THE TOP.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.321
I'D HAVE TO START

04:39.154 --> 04:40.321
AT LEVEL ONE,

WHICH IS WHERE ALL

04:40.363 --> 04:42.991

04:44.367 --> 04:47.121
I'D FLIRT WITH THE CAMERAMAN

04:44.367 --> 04:47.121

TO GET OFF LEVEL TWO...

04:53.252 --> 04:55.336
(normal voice)

04:53.252 --> 04:55.336
I PLANNED TO INVENT A DANCE.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.588
NOTHING TOO FLAMBOYANT,

04:56.630 --> 04:59.174
BUT JUST ENOUGH

04:56.630 --> 04:59.174
TO GET THE SPOTLIGHT ON ME,

04:59.216 --> 05:01.342
WHICH WOULD'VE GOTTEN ME

04:59.216 --> 05:01.342
TO LEVEL THREE,

05:01.384 --> 05:03.595
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A SHOT

05:01.384 --> 05:03.595

05:03.637 --> 05:05.430
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ATTITUDE.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.348

05:05.472 --> 05:07.348
YOU HAD THIS ALL MAPPED OUT.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.516
SHE NEVER GOT THE AUDITION.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.602
OR AT LEAST SHE NEVER KNEW

05:08.558 --> 05:10.602
ABOUT IT.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.229
TRISH?

05:12.271 --> 05:13.396
WHEN "THE CRANK" CALLED,

05:13.438 --> 05:15.440
TRISH NEVER GAVE CHLOE

05:13.438 --> 05:15.440
THE VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.859
INSTEAD, SHE TOOK CHLOE'S

05:15.482 --> 05:17.859
AUDITION, GOT ON THE SHOW,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.361

05:17.901 --> 05:20.361
ALL THE WAY UP TO FOOT HO.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
BY THE TIME CHLOE FOUND OUT,

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
TRISH HAD MOVED OUT

05:22.447 --> 05:24.365
AND LEFT HER OWING

05:22.447 --> 05:24.365
THREE MONTHS' RENT.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.368
AND THEN SHE VANISHED

05:24.407 --> 05:27.368
WHEN "THE CRANK" GOT CANCELED.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
MY FOOT HO DREAM WAS REPLACED

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
BY A NEW DREAM--

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
DESTROYING TRISH.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.540
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.375
HOW COME YOU NEVER

05:32.582 --> 05:34.375
TOLD ME THIS?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.044
BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.044
WE JUST MET.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.379
BUT WE'VE BEEN ROOMMATES

05:36.086 --> 05:38.379
FOR OVER A YEAR.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.175
WHOA. IT SEEMS LIKE

05:38.421 --> 05:41.175
SO MUCH LONGER THAN THAT.

05:41.216 --> 05:44.678
NOT GETTING TRISH BACK

05:41.216 --> 05:44.678
FOR WHAT SHE DID TO ME

05:44.719 --> 05:47.388
IS MY LIFE'S ONLY REGRET.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.890

05:53.478 --> 05:54.646
AND BLAST OUT HER EARDRUMS.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.607
AND THEN I'M GONNA YELL,

05:54.688 --> 05:57.607
"I FOUND YOU, BITCH!"

05:59.442 --> 06:02.904
YOU ARE GOING TO BLOW HER

05:59.442 --> 06:02.904
EARDRUMS OUT?

06:02.946 --> 06:05.490
THAT'S THE REVENGE THAT YOU'VE

06:02.946 --> 06:05.490
BEEN PLOTTING FOR TEN YEARS?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.617
NO. AT FIRST,

06:05.532 --> 06:07.617
I PLANNED ON STRANGLING HER

06:07.659 --> 06:09.410
WITH HER JUICY SWEATPANTS.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.331
BUT IF SHE'S STILL

06:09.452 --> 06:12.331
WEARING THOSE, I'VE ALREADY WON.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.414
WHERE IS SHE?

06:13.456 --> 06:14.582
NEW JERSEY.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.126
SHE LET HER GUARD DOWN

06:14.624 --> 06:16.126
AND JOINED A GYM.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.046
I KNEW SHE'D GET FAT.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.421
AND THAT'S THE REASON

06:20.463 --> 06:22.507
I DON'T DRIVE

06:20.463 --> 06:22.507
IN THE CENTER LANE ANYMORE.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.635
GARY, WE CAN'T JUST

06:22.549 --> 06:25.635
KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.512
LET'S JUST TELL HIM

06:25.677 --> 06:27.512
WHAT WE NEED TO TELL HIM.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.223
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

06:29.264 --> 06:32.433
WELL... (sighs)

06:32.475 --> 06:34.228
HONEY...

06:34.269 --> 06:36.938
GARY ISN'T YOUR REAL FATHER.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.439
WHAT?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.693
WE AGREED TO WAIT TO TELL YOU

06:38.481 --> 06:41.693
THE NEWS UNTIL YOU WERE 35.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
IT SEEMED LIKE

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
THE RIGHT AGE.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.613
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR 20s

06:45.655 --> 06:48.325
BUT STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO BOUNCE

06:45.655 --> 06:48.325
BACK FROM THE LIE YOU'VE LIVED.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.492
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.952
W--

06:50.994 --> 06:53.163
IF YOU--IF YOU'RE NOT

06:50.994 --> 06:53.163
MY REAL DAD, THEN WHO IS?

06:53.205 --> 06:54.748
(chuckles)

06:53.205 --> 06:54.748
THERE'S THE QUESTION.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.458
(laughs) WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
NOW WE KNOW IT WAS

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
THE SUMMER OF '77...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
YEP.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.339
AND YOUR MOTHER WAS DOING

06:59.502 --> 07:02.339
SUMMER STOCK THEATER IN MAINE.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.631
"SEVEN BRIDES

07:02.381 --> 07:03.631
FOR SEVEN BROTHERS."

07:03.673 --> 07:06.467
AND SHE HAD A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER

07:03.673 --> 07:06.467
WITH ONE OF THE BROTHERS.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.469
MY REAL FATHER.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.469
YEP.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.765
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, I JUST--

07:08.511 --> 07:11.765
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH BROTHER.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.934
BUT IT WAS THE '70s.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.934
IT'S ALL A BLUR.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.769
I DID A LOT OF PLAYS.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.520
AND A LOT OF DRUGS

07:15.810 --> 07:17.520
AND A LOT OF DUDES.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.356
(laughs)

07:19.398 --> 07:20.481
GARY, PLEASE.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.192
(whispering) ANYWAY.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.192
(clears throat)

07:22.234 --> 07:23.402
I, UH...

07:23.443 --> 07:24.861
YEAH.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.571
(normal voice) YOUR FATHER

07:26.613 --> 07:29.157
IS ONE OF THESE SEVEN MEN.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.659
I'M SURE THIS IS

07:29.199 --> 07:31.659
QUITE A SHOCK...

07:31.701 --> 07:32.493
(baby talk) BUT YOU ARE

07:31.701 --> 07:32.493
SUCH A GOOD BABY,

07:32.535 --> 07:33.745
AND WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.496
(normal voice) OH, HI!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.496
HI. EXCUSE ME.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.498
YES, I ASKED YOU IF YOU COULD DO

07:35.538 --> 07:37.498
SOMETHING ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE,

07:37.540 --> 07:40.460
AND YOU SAID "YES,"

07:37.540 --> 07:40.460
AND I AM STILL FREEZING.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.090
I'M JUST SAYING,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.090
IT'S WEIRD.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.591
I THOUGHT WE WERE CLOSE,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.509
BUT I'M REALIZING I DON'T KNOW

07:46.633 --> 07:48.509
ANYTHING REAL ABOUT YOU.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.510
WHAT DO YOU MEAN REAL?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.012
WELL, LIKE THIS DREAM

07:49.552 --> 07:51.012
OF YOURS.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.806
HOW DID YOU DECIDE YOU WANTED

07:51.054 --> 07:52.806
TO BE A FOOT HO?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.099
(exhales deeply)

07:54.141 --> 07:57.144
HOW DID IT FEEL

07:54.141 --> 07:57.144
WHEN TRISH BETRAYED YOU?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.937
IF YOU COULD BE

07:57.185 --> 07:58.937
ANY FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM,

07:58.979 --> 08:00.563
WHAT FLAVOR WOULD YOU BE?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.441
I'M REGRETTING LETTING YOU

08:00.605 --> 08:02.441
TAKE OFF WORK, RENT A CAR,

08:02.482 --> 08:03.900
AND DRIVE ME TO NEW JERSEY,

08:02.482 --> 08:03.900
JUNE.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
I JUST WANNA FIND OUT

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
MORE ABOUT YOU

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
WITHOUT HAVING TO HEAR

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
FROM YOUR STUPID P.I.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.738
FIRST OF ALL,

08:07.570 --> 08:08.738
TOMMY IS NOT STUPID.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.531
HE WENT TO SAN DIEGO STATE.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.409
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

08:10.573 --> 08:12.409
GIVEN ME THE VOICEMAIL PASSWORD

08:12.451 --> 08:13.994
TO OUR HOME PHONE.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.331
WOW. THE WORKOUT STARTS

08:14.035 --> 08:17.331
AT THE DOOR, HUH?

08:17.372 --> 08:20.917
HELLO, AND WELCOME TO

08:17.372 --> 08:20.917
BODIES BODIES BODIES BODIES!

08:20.959 --> 08:24.004
I'M HEATHER. WHAT CAN I DO

08:20.959 --> 08:24.004
TO MAKE YOU A BETTER YOU?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.922
FIRST OF ALL,

08:24.045 --> 08:25.922
YOU CAN STOP YELLING!

08:25.964 --> 08:28.467
SECOND, YOU CAN HELP ME FIND

08:25.964 --> 08:28.467
ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS--

08:28.508 --> 08:31.345
A REAL SKEEZED-OUT JERK

08:28.508 --> 08:31.345
NAMED TRISH OSBORNE.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.721
ARE YOU CHLOE?

08:33.763 --> 08:34.639
YEAH.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.183
WHEN TRISH SIGNED UP

08:34.681 --> 08:36.183
FOR A MEMBERSHIP,

08:36.224 --> 08:39.560
SHE SAID A WOMAN NAMED CHLOE

08:36.224 --> 08:39.560
WOULD COME LOOKING FOR HER.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.438
SAID YOU'D CALL HER

08:39.602 --> 08:41.438
A "SKEEZED-OUT JERK," TOO.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
WHERE IS SHE?

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
IS SHE IN THE LOCKER ROOM?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.566
I'M GONNA TRAP HER IN THE SAUNA

08:43.023 --> 08:45.566
AND BLAST OUT HER EARDRUMS.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.943
TRISH IS DEAD.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.569
(speed metal song playing)

08:48.611 --> 08:51.365
AAH! AAH! UGH!

08:51.406 --> 08:53.574
I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT SONG

08:51.406 --> 08:53.574
YOU WERE GONNA PLAY.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.576
YOU NEVER TELL ME ANYTHING!

08:55.618 --> 08:56.536
(door slams)

09:01.624 --> 09:03.084
THAT HOOKER DIED?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.253
TRISH DID PASS, YES.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.382
SHE KNEW SHE WAS SICK WHEN SHE

09:05.295 --> 09:08.382
CAME IN AND REFUSED THE TOUR.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.757
SHE WAS ONLY JOINING

09:08.423 --> 09:09.757
TO GET ON THE GRID

09:09.799 --> 09:12.219
BECAUSE SHE KNEW YOU WERE

09:09.799 --> 09:12.219
LOOKING FOR HER.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.637
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO

09:12.260 --> 09:14.637
GET REVENGE ON A DEAD LADY?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.558
SHE WANTED US

09:16.681 --> 09:18.558
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.686
(grunts)

09:24.689 --> 09:27.067
OH.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.610
(gasps)

09:27.108 --> 09:29.610
IS THAT AN OPIUM PIPE?

09:27.108 --> 09:29.610
I SAW ONE ON THE NEWS ONCE.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.238
IT'S THE "CRANK" CRANK.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.822
ONLY THE HOST AND THE FOOT HO

09:31.279 --> 09:32.822
HAD ONE.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.824
IT WAS THE KEY TO GET INTO

09:32.864 --> 09:34.824
THE TOP LEVEL OF THE SHOW.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.202
TRISH LEFT THIS HERE

09:34.866 --> 09:37.202
TO RUB IT IN MY FACE

09:37.244 --> 09:41.456
THAT SHE GOT UP THERE

09:37.244 --> 09:41.456
AND I NEVER DID!

09:41.498 --> 09:42.707
HOW DID SHE LOOK

09:41.498 --> 09:42.707
WHEN SHE CAME IN?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.209
THE CANCER MADE HER THIN.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.710
DAMN IT!

09:49.548 --> 09:51.550
(slurping)

09:49.548 --> 09:51.550
I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH

09:49.548 --> 09:51.550
BECAUSE GARY'S SO GREAT.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.677
BUT NOW THERE'S A CHANCE THAT

09:51.591 --> 09:54.677
MY DAD HAD SOME ACTUAL TALENT.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.012
(stops slurping)

09:54.719 --> 09:56.012
IS GARY GREAT?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.805
I WOULDN'T KNOW

09:56.054 --> 09:57.805
SINCE I'VE NEVER MET HIM.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.057
OR YOUR MOTHER.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.684
BOTH GREAT.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.684
OH. GOOD.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.311
ELI'S MET THEM.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.688
(sighs)

10:03.353 --> 10:05.688
I DON'T KNOW WHY

10:03.353 --> 10:05.688
YOU REFUSE TO INTRODUCE US.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.941
I INVITED YOU TO DINNER

10:05.730 --> 10:07.941
WITH MY FAMILY.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.319
(traditional Chinese music

10:07.982 --> 10:11.319
playing)

10:11.361 --> 10:13.947
IS HE EVEN COMING?

10:13.988 --> 10:16.533
I'M GONNA ORDER.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.533
YOUR FATHER IS STARVING.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.658
DON'T YOU DARE, PATRICE!

10:17.700 --> 10:19.494
(sighs and chuckles)

10:19.536 --> 10:21.746
HE WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.746
(chuckles)

10:21.788 --> 10:23.664
(mouths word) I'M GONNA

10:21.788 --> 10:23.664
SEND HIM A TEXT.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.375
(chuckles)

10:23.706 --> 10:25.375
(clicking)

10:25.417 --> 10:27.168
(cell phone alert chimes)

10:30.004 --> 10:32.132
(clicking)

10:32.173 --> 10:33.633
(bloop)

10:36.719 --> 10:40.098
IN MY DEFENSE,

10:36.719 --> 10:40.098
I WAS SUPER-DUPER SLEEPY.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.682
ALL RIGHT.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.519
MOM SAYS MY DAD IS ONE

10:41.724 --> 10:44.519
OF THESE SEVEN TALENTS.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.686
GAY AND GAY.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.730
(click)

10:47.772 --> 10:49.941
MY DAD IS ONE OF

10:47.772 --> 10:49.941
THESE FIVE TALENTS.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.944
JAMES, I'M SORRY. I'D BE MORE

10:49.983 --> 10:52.944
INTERESTED IN YOUR DAD THING

10:52.986 --> 10:54.488
IF EVERY TIME I CLOSED MY EYES,

10:54.529 --> 10:56.906
I DIDN'T SEE TRISH

10:54.529 --> 10:56.906
FLIPPING ME OFF FROM THE GRAVE.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.533
SOMETIMES I SEE

10:56.948 --> 10:58.533
THE GHOST OF DORIS,

10:58.575 --> 11:00.785
THE OLD LADY

10:58.575 --> 11:00.785
WHO DIED IN MY TUB.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.203
I ALSO FOUND A PURSE

11:00.827 --> 11:02.203
WITH HER S.A.G. CARD

11:02.245 --> 11:04.789
AND $14 TAPED BEHIND THE TOILET.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.751
CHLOE, YOU GOTTA LET

11:04.831 --> 11:08.751
THE TRISH THING GO. SHE'S DEAD.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.420
EXACTLY.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.798
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HER

11:10.462 --> 11:13.798
FOR TEN YEARS, AND SHE'S DEAD.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.925
I'LL NEVER GET MY REVENGE.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.802
IT'S OVER.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.886
(slurping)

11:18.928 --> 11:21.722
HE WAS HIDING

11:18.928 --> 11:21.722
BUT I SEE HIM NOW. GAY.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.932
OH.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.932
(clicks pen)

11:22.974 --> 11:24.351
(slurps)

11:24.392 --> 11:25.810
(elevator bell dings)

11:25.852 --> 11:27.562
HEY!

11:25.852 --> 11:27.562
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.147
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING

11:27.604 --> 11:29.147
TO THE MOVIES.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.732
I TEXTED YOU THAT I BOUGHT

11:29.189 --> 11:31.732
TICKETS TO THE EARLY SHOW.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.443
THAT ISN'T

11:31.774 --> 11:33.443
WHAT YOUR TEXT SAID.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.739
OH! (laughs)

11:38.781 --> 11:40.534
I-I'VE BEEN

11:38.781 --> 11:40.534
SPEAKING MY TEXTS LATELY.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.536
WELL, I LEFT YOU A MESSAGE

11:40.575 --> 11:42.536
AT HOME, TOO.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.954
OH. I DON'T HAVE ACCESS

11:42.577 --> 11:44.954
TO THAT VOICEMAIL

11:44.996 --> 11:46.414
'CAUSE CHLOE WON'T GIVE ME

11:44.996 --> 11:46.414
THE CODE.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.749
SHE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING

11:46.456 --> 11:48.749
SHE CARES ABOUT.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.043
SHE MIGHT JUST BE
