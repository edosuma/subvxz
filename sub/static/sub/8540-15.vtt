[instrumental music]

00:04.787 --> 00:06.963
Welcome to the 23rd annual

00:07.050 --> 00:09.574
Westing Resort
best chef challenge.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.101
[male #1]
'Don't burn those scallops.'

00:14.188 --> 00:16.538
I'm Bertram Duesterberg,
your host.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.975
'Our competing chefs
today are'

00:19.062 --> 00:23.153
'first, from restaurant 182
in Sonoma..'

00:23.240 --> 00:26.939
'The youngest winner ever of
the Schilling Palm d'cuisine'

00:27.027 --> 00:28.593
Chef Hannah Diaz.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.774
'From San Francisco,
where they host'

00:35.861 --> 00:39.082
the acclaimed public
radio show two top

00:39.169 --> 00:41.606
Chefs Arliss and
Julia St. Germain.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.830
[indistinct chatter]

00:49.527 --> 00:52.139
Jeff, do you want
the mousse?

00:52.226 --> 00:54.663
- Jeff?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.621
Trained in Paris

00:56.708 --> 00:59.363
he is executive chef
at La Petite Maison

00:59.450 --> 01:01.887
Chef Adrien Ludo!

01:06.066 --> 01:07.937
[indistinct chatter]

01:08.024 --> 01:11.201
Where's my chives?
Let's go, people!

01:11.288 --> 01:15.858
And first up
before our judges today..

01:15.945 --> 01:17.773
Okay, let's move!

01:17.860 --> 01:20.036
- Come on, go, go!
- 'Hurry up, people.'

01:20.123 --> 01:21.603
Jeffrey Barge.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.002
Thank you.

01:37.749 --> 01:38.837
My..

01:38.924 --> 01:40.012
[clears throat]

01:40.100 --> 01:43.886
My first, dish today, is..

01:47.455 --> 01:48.804
'...is, uh..'

01:52.199 --> 01:55.115
[all screaming]

01:55.202 --> 01:58.292
Oh, my goodness.
Call a doctor!

01:58.379 --> 02:00.598
Is there a doctor
in house, please?

02:00.685 --> 02:03.210
- Somebody call 9-1-1!
- Jeffrey!

02:04.689 --> 02:06.909
[female #1]
'Jeffrey! Somebody!'

02:06.996 --> 02:09.781
'Jeffrey, say something!'

02:09.868 --> 02:11.827
'Can you hear me? Jeffrey?'

02:11.914 --> 02:15.483
Doctor, he's not moving.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.006
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:21.228 --> 02:22.838
Anything from
the deputy coroner?

02:22.925 --> 02:24.187
Just that he can't tell
us anything yet.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.884
Tell him we need to know.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.191
If this guy died of natural
causes we're going home.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.324
- Why so grumpy?
- I'm not.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.108
Why are we here? We don't
even know if it's a murder.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.763
One of the chefs called
her daddy who's a state senator

02:34.850 --> 02:37.374
who called the AG,
who called the assistant AG

02:37.461 --> 02:39.507
who called me.
So we're here.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.856
I hate politics.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.466
This might go quick.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.859
Victim had a fistfight
with the event organizer.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.339
Happy days.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.299
[Bertram]
I want to be very clear.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.779
What happened was
sheerest accident.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.650
I did nothing wrong.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.697
Let's just stick to the facts,
Mr. Duesterberg.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.395
You said you had a fight
with the victim. About what?

02:58.482 --> 03:00.919
- Truffles.
- Truffles?

03:01.006 --> 03:02.921
Yes. They, they're
very pricey fungus.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.793
I know what a truffle is.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.578
Uh, Jeffrey ordered a bundle
and he paid for them himself.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.319
A few hours
before the competition

03:09.406 --> 03:11.103
he couldn't find them.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.889
He demanded replacements,
which would have cost thousands.

03:13.976 --> 03:18.023
I said no. He started yelling
and then shoving.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.808
Naturally, I defended myself.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.549
Very gently, of course.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.812
And then he, fell on his head?
Something like that?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.379
It's as I said it wa..
It was an accident.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.945
Oh, we'll see.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.731
Jeffrey sounds like a scrapper.
Quick with his fists?

03:29.818 --> 03:32.995
No, not really. He was..
He was a genius.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.171
Genius can be noisy.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.478
But he, he's never
laid hands on me before.

03:37.565 --> 03:40.220
Genius, really?

03:40.307 --> 03:41.308
Hmm.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.961
[clears throat]

03:43.048 --> 03:44.876
Hey, is he good for it?

03:44.963 --> 03:46.530
Not sure yet. What's that?

03:46.617 --> 03:48.228
I don't know. Some hors d'oeuvre
thing they're handing out.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.620
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.013
I don't eat
anything I can't identify.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.275
- Hmm.
- Excuse me.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.103
Is this the victim's dish?

03:54.190 --> 03:56.627
Yes.

03:56.714 --> 03:57.889
Mmm.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.283
Mm-hmm.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.156
Excuse me.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.723
[clears throat]

04:05.810 --> 04:07.638
[grunting]

04:07.725 --> 04:09.292
Pardon.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.599
No genius there.
Waytoo much salt.

04:13.688 --> 04:14.863
Hmm.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.822
- Dr. Steiner.
- Hmm?

04:17.909 --> 04:20.172
Long time.
New threads. Sharp.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.437
Yes. The move from Sacramento
has been quite pleasant.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.743
Fine wine, lovely weather,
no Patrick Jane

04:25.830 --> 04:27.179
or so I hoped.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.051
Cheeky.
Have you checked his mouth?

04:29.138 --> 04:31.662
For a possible head injury?
I don't think so.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.969
Don't be alarmed,
I amgoing to touch you.

04:34.056 --> 04:37.277
Mr. Jane, please,
I am in the..

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
Yuck. Lisbon!

04:41.455 --> 04:43.021
Excuse me.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.110
What.. What made you think
to look there?

04:45.197 --> 04:47.678
Well, bad-tasting food
means bad taste buds.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.115
So much for the head wound.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.856
[Patrick]
'Hmm.'

04:51.943 --> 04:53.989
Duesterberg's off the hook.
He didn't die from a fall.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.599
Let's huddle together,
divvy up the interviews.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.514
What did kill him?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.037
Poison.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.608
[gags]

05:05.870 --> 05:08.743
[theme music]

05:15.967 --> 05:17.621
Preliminary test came back.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.754
Deputy Coroner says that
the poison is probably ricin.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.277
Victim either
ate it or drank it.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.409
It makes sense.
If it was airborne

05:22.496 --> 05:24.019
people would be dropping
like flies.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.760
Ricin's easy enough to make.
Grind up some castor beans.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.675
Makes for a broad suspect pool.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.067
They tested the victim's food
there's no sign of it there

05:29.154 --> 05:30.155
or in the kitchen.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.679
The ricin takes hours to work.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.202
Must've been something
he ingested a while ago.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.899
No need to get
your stomach pumped then, huh?

05:34.986 --> 05:36.988
[phone ringing]
Ha, funny.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.034
You search the room. Test any
liquid or food that you find.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.644
Yeah, okay.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.343
Thanks. The victim's wife
just arrived.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.127
I'll handle it.
You talk to the other chefs.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.476
Duesterberg says that

05:46.563 --> 05:49.000
the winner of the contest
gets 100 grand.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.703
[Teresa]
'What are you doing?'

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
Oh, um..

05:57.661 --> 06:00.751
Trying to get the taste
of salty food out of my mouth.

06:00.838 --> 06:04.929
Pot de creme. It's basically
a pretentious chocolate pudding.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.714
- Very nice. You want some?
- No.

06:06.801 --> 06:09.281
We have to go and talk
to the victim's wife.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.197
Mmm. Well, maybe
she'll want some.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.416
Comfort food.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.898
[Arliss]
'Jeffrey was a dear friend.'

06:16.985 --> 06:18.421
We'd known each other for years.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.641
Which is why I had
my father bring you on.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.207
We want to find out
who did this.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.513
Interesting that
you called us in

06:23.600 --> 06:25.210
before anyone knew
it was poison.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.690
You know something
everyone else didn't?

06:26.777 --> 06:29.867
No, I just knew
that something was wrong.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.304
Now you're all in competition
for a large cash prize.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.610
Helps that one of you is dead,
doesn't it?

06:33.697 --> 06:35.395
- 'Helps?'
- We eat together.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.918
We work together.
We're comrades.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.789
[Diaz chuckles]

06:38.876 --> 06:40.225
Something to add,
Ms. Diaz?

06:40.312 --> 06:42.576
Dude, if we're all
such comrades

06:42.663 --> 06:44.273
why'd you try and steal
Jeff's sous-chef?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.275
Not true.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.755
Inquiries were made,
that's all.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.365
[chuckles]
Yeah, right.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.410
How'd you feel
about the victim?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.802
I hated his guts.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.457
Egotistical, manipulative

06:54.544 --> 06:56.372
maybe half as good
as he thought he was.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.722
Which would still make him
twice the chef that you are.

06:58.809 --> 06:59.941
Why don't you go
get another tattoo?

07:00.028 --> 07:01.551
Bite me, Julia.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.248
The delivery guy says
he left Jeffrey's truffles

07:03.335 --> 07:05.860
on his station this morning,
then they vanished.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.428
So who stole the truffles?

07:08.515 --> 07:10.430
[French accent]
Well, stealing truffles
makes one of us a murderer?

07:10.517 --> 07:11.605
It's a start.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.823
[scoffs]

07:15.217 --> 07:17.001
What?

07:17.088 --> 07:18.742
That is exactly the kind
of thing that hewould do.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.788
He and Jeffrey
never really got along.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.442
You fat bastard.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.008
And truffles are
very expensive, aren't they?

07:24.095 --> 07:25.314
And you wouldn't
throw them out.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.011
Where does he keep his food?

07:27.098 --> 07:29.013
Down on the left side
of the pantry.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.408
You know who would stop
at nothing to win? Those two.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.106
Ask them about the book deal
they've been chasing.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.500
'A competition prize
would help that, no?'

07:40.677 --> 07:41.635
[clears throat]

07:41.722 --> 07:43.680
Okay, fine. Arrest me.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.682
But I didn't
steal the truffles, okay?

07:45.769 --> 07:47.902
I rescued them
from a terrible, terrible fate.

07:47.989 --> 07:51.601
I see.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.430
Did Jeffrey have any problems
that you knew about

07:54.517 --> 07:55.692
personally or at work?

07:56.650 --> 07:57.781
[sighs]
Well, um..

07:59.783 --> 08:01.481
We were a problem.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.572
We're separated.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
I haven't spoken
to Jeffrey in months.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.705
What was the breakup about?

08:08.792 --> 08:11.273
Oh, god, what wasn't? Um..

08:11.360 --> 08:13.405
Drinking, mostly.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.364
Occupational disease
for chefs.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.061
It's the pressure.
It wants a release.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.498
That, and, um..

08:18.585 --> 08:21.413
Don't listen to her,
whatever she says.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.850
She hates Jeff.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.679
- And you are?
- Victim's brother.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.159
Cheekbones.
Come on. You can see that.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.334
[mouthing]

08:29.421 --> 08:30.727
Uh, Kevin,
why don't we talk later?

08:30.814 --> 08:33.251
Yeah, I-I don't think so,
Abigail.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.689
My brother was
a freakin' genius, alright?

08:35.776 --> 08:38.300
You think anybody in my family
taught him how to cook?

08:38.387 --> 08:41.695
Please. He wanted to be a great
chef, and that's what he was.

08:41.782 --> 08:45.046
Did it all by himself.
And you?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.830
You were perfectly happy
to spend his money

08:46.917 --> 08:49.311
weren't you, Abigail?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.705
Your brother was a great man.
He elevated himself, didn't he?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.533
But you didn't.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.101
That must've been cause for
some friction, I would think.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.451
'Did he leave you anything,
your brother?'

08:59.539 --> 09:02.106
Or did he leave it all
to the hated sister-in-law?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.412
- The money, the restaurant--
- Why don't you step back?

09:03.499 --> 09:04.935
Kevin, that's enough, alright?

09:05.022 --> 09:06.850
No, you don't tell me
what to do, okay?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.374
As you can see, drinking,
it runs in the family.

09:09.461 --> 09:12.247
[Kevin]
'Oh, s-see, that's how wrong
you are, actually.'

09:12.334 --> 09:15.816
Jeff was sober. He was
in the program for two weeks.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.731
Right. I've heard that before.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.299
It's probably why he called.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.823
You said
you hadn't talked to him.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.999
I-I didn't talk.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.567
Whoa. Two weeks sober.
That's impressive.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.179
And what else
are you hiding from us?

09:32.746 --> 09:34.835
Look, he called last night
at 12:30.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.055
I hung up.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.666
What'd he say?

09:39.753 --> 09:41.929
He said..

09:42.016 --> 09:43.191
[sighs]

09:44.975 --> 09:48.239
[sighs]
He said he was sorry.

09:57.901 --> 09:58.902
[knocks on door]

09:58.989 --> 10:00.643
[Wayne]
'Hey.'

10:00.730 --> 10:02.863
Test for ricin.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.648
Yellow means positive,
nothing means..

10:05.735 --> 10:07.519
[sighs]

10:07.607 --> 10:08.738
...nothing.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.786
This place is quite a mess.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.701
What do you think
the intruder wanted?

10:14.788 --> 10:17.355
Nobody was looking
for anything.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.922
Jeffrey did this himself.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.794
And you know this, how?

10:20.881 --> 10:23.405
The punched-in mirror
is an act of self-hatred.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.668
Plus, all these drawers
are closed.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.670
A thoughtful ransacker
would close maybe one

10:27.757 --> 10:29.367
but all of them? No.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.109
Anyway.. Room's cleared.
No poison. We're moving on.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.328
[Patrick]
'That's nice.'

10:35.939 --> 10:38.986
Except you're not.
What's up?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.335
Well, Jeffrey
was recently sober

10:40.422 --> 10:41.815
but acting erratically.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.035
Demolishing his room,
picking fistfights

10:45.122 --> 10:46.950
calling his estranged wife
in the middle of the night

10:47.037 --> 10:47.995
you know what that's called?

10:48.082 --> 10:49.997
Relapse?

10:50.084 --> 10:53.087
Yes. And an addict on a relapse
will hide his stash.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.396
Ah.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.659
[chuckles]

11:03.184 --> 11:04.664
What better way
to poison a drunk

11:04.751 --> 11:06.274
than through his drink?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.579
Let's check it out.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.798
'Let's.'

11:15.500 --> 11:16.458
There we go.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.764
Hold the applause.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.899
Bingo.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.556
[Patrick]
'Poison gin.'

11:29.950 --> 11:32.126
A smart way
to eliminate a rival.

11:35.085 --> 11:38.045
But not the act
of a gentleman, is it?

11:39.655 --> 11:41.178
[imitates French accent]
MonsieurLudo?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.965
Are you joking?

11:45.052 --> 11:48.620
Rigsby, take him in.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.884
[Ludo]
'This is not right.'

11:50.971 --> 11:52.929
I have done nothing.
I have done nothing.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.539
- Hang on.
- Come on, let's..

11:56.498 --> 11:57.673
[Patrick]
'She's the one
we need to talk to.'

11:57.760 --> 11:59.240
Me? Wh..

11:59.327 --> 12:01.329
You should've seen your reaction
when I accused Ludo..

12:01.416 --> 12:03.461
Pure relief.

12:03.548 --> 12:07.683
Oh, come on, please.
At least attempt denying it.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.381
- I didn't do it.
- She's the one.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.426
[Hannah sighs]

12:11.513 --> 12:13.733
Thank you.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.951
Merci.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.479
Why would I want
to kill Jeffrey?

12:21.566 --> 12:23.481
Winning a contest like this
would do a lot for a young woman

12:23.568 --> 12:24.874
trying to prove herself.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.615
I don't have anything
to prove.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.356
'You're a good cook.'

12:28.443 --> 12:30.401
Making ricin out of castor beans
wouldn't be hard, would it?

12:30.488 --> 12:32.099
No. But I didn't.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.842
[Kimball]
Take a look at this, Hanna.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.582
That's your credit card
statement.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.151
You bought gin.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.980
I'm over 21,
it's not a crime.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.721
[Kimball]
'You just happened to buy
yourself the same type of gin'

12:45.808 --> 12:46.766
'we found in the victim's room?'

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
Look, can I go
or what? I..

12:48.289 --> 12:49.899
Hannah.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.162
We have enough to charge
you with murder right now.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.382
You need to talk to us,
tell us your side of the story.

12:56.688 --> 12:57.820
[sighs]

13:00.997 --> 13:02.520
I'm 28.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.261
I run my own kitchen.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.351
I don't have any..

13:08.352 --> 13:09.745
Food channel connections

13:09.832 --> 13:11.747
no cookbook
with my name on it.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.663
The Westing is my way up.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.492
[scoffs]

13:17.579 --> 13:19.320
Jeffrey was the one to beat.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.845
We all knew it.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.848
So I figured,
get him a drink.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.809
Why not?
Level the playing field.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.377
So, yeah,
I bought him the gin.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.379
But I have no idea
how the ricin got in there.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.164
Okay.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.993
I just tried
to get him drunk, that's all.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.516
No poison.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.390
[sighs]

13:46.477 --> 13:48.610
Without anything else,
we can't hold her.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.699
What do you got?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.005
Jeffrey's phone records.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.007
Confirmed the call
with his wife.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.748
How long did they talk?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.926
'About five seconds.
Guess she did hang up.'

14:00.013 --> 14:01.666
But there's a second call
at 2:00 a.m.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.103
That one lasted
over an hour.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.757
- Who'd he call?
- His restaurant.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.809
Ms. Barge,
you have a minute?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.638
Yeah, sure. What's up?

14:16.725 --> 14:19.206
- Money troubles?
- How'd you guess?

14:19.293 --> 14:21.512
Well, it's a restaurant.
They always have money troubles.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.515
Well, this restaurant's
drowning in debt.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.605
Jeffrey was driving this place
off a cliff.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.042
It was all about the food.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.437
This is Eliza Greene,
Jeffrey's sous-chef.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.527
She's keeping things afloat
while I get my bearings..

14:36.614 --> 14:38.399
now that I own
a failing restaurant.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.575
[Eliza chuckles]

14:40.662 --> 14:42.229
Oh, sorry.

14:42.316 --> 14:45.667
Um, people would say that
the place is failing

14:45.754 --> 14:47.625
and, uh, Jeffrey would say

14:47.712 --> 14:49.976
yes, but failing
with style.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.630
Eliza, oh, you're the one
the others wanted to hire.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.458
You must be very good.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.982
I guess. I wouldn't know.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.853
False modesty?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.594
Jeffrey called the restaurant
last night at 2:00 a.m.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.204
Do you know
who he spoke to?

15:01.291 --> 15:04.251
Me. Oh, uh, he was considering
changing the menu

15:04.338 --> 15:06.601
for the contest,
wanted to talk about it.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.647
Couldn't that have waited
till the morning?

15:09.734 --> 15:12.172
That was just Jeff
being Jeff.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.825
He was always
after perfection.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.392
Irritating, getting
a phone call like that

15:15.479 --> 15:16.959
when you're on your way home
from work, isn't it?

15:17.046 --> 15:18.613
Not at all.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.963
If you want
to make something great

15:21.050 --> 15:22.530
that's the job.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.748
[clears throat]
You know you should really

15:23.835 --> 15:25.011
get these, uh, deposits posted

15:25.098 --> 15:27.143
or the checks are gonna bounce.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.666
Thanks for your time.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.278
- 'Thank you.'
- Night.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.496
Bye.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.150
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.851
Where are my keys?

15:41.375 --> 15:42.811
You picked my pocket?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.466
- My turn to drive.
- Jane!

15:45.553 --> 15:47.250
Oh, don't be
such an old lady. Get in.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.210
Your fears are groundless.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.690
You're right.
The car has air bags.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.264
[grunting]

16:01.351 --> 16:02.918
[screaming]

16:03.005 --> 16:04.137
Oh, no.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.925
Oh, bad move.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.666
[grunting]

16:11.753 --> 16:13.276
[groaning]

16:13.363 --> 16:14.625
[crickets chirping]

16:16.540 --> 16:17.715
[groaning]

16:25.027 --> 16:26.463
[Patrick]
'Oh.'

16:26.550 --> 16:27.682
[Teresa]
'Victim's brother?'

16:27.769 --> 16:30.250
[Patrick]
'Kevin.'

16:30.337 --> 16:34.080
Oh, I can't tell you how happy
I am that wasn't my car.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.610
You're out
of your freakin' mind.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.178
I would never, ever
harm my brother, ever.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.441
You assaulted
and robbed a girl, Kevin

16:47.528 --> 16:49.834
who ran your brother's
restaurant.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.620
You don't think that makes
you a little suspicious?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.709
That had nothing to do
with what happened to Jeff.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.667
I don't believe you.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.061
I can tell you why I went
after the money, alright

16:59.148 --> 17:00.758
but I'm gonna need
some guarantees.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.892
Oh, so we're negotiating now,
are we?

17:03.979 --> 17:06.199
I have valuable information.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.940
I can help you solve
Jeff's murder.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.117
But you're not
gonna tell us anything

17:11.204 --> 17:12.770
unless we cut you a deal?

17:16.557 --> 17:19.299
We're talking about
your brother here, Kevin.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.127
That's pretty low.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.349
You know what?
You're going to jail.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.785
You'll have plenty of time
to think about

17:27.872 --> 17:30.832
how you could've
done things differently.

17:33.791 --> 17:34.966
Wait.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.320
Sean Horlick.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.235
Jeff owed him money.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.584
He needed it
for the restaurant.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.194
Guy's a loan shark.

17:45.281 --> 17:48.545
I actually put them in touch
five months ago.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.460
I get a call yesterday
from Horlick

17:50.547 --> 17:52.810
and he says unless I want
to end up like Jeff

17:52.897 --> 17:54.551
I'd better get him
the money he owed.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.076
So you rob
your dead brother's wife?

17:57.163 --> 17:59.687
[scoffs]
She was always trying
to turn Jeff against me.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.515
Said I was a bad influence
or somethin'.

18:01.602 --> 18:05.127
Imagine that, huh?
Crazy.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.521
[sighs]
I knew their deposit schedule

18:07.608 --> 18:09.566
and they don't keep a gun.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.352
I figured
she screwed me before

18:12.439 --> 18:14.310
I screw her back.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.659
Sean Horlick.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.270
What else do you know
about him?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.446
Fraud, racketeering, extortion,

18:19.533 --> 18:21.274
couple of violent crimes
sprinkled in.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.841
Charges never seem to stick.
Horlick's smart.

18:23.928 --> 18:24.842
Track him down.
Take Rigsby.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.235
Okay.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.150
Cho, look into
Jeffrey's restaurant

18:28.237 --> 18:31.197
the financial records,
see who else he owed money to.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.068
[yawning]
I'll come with.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.985
I'm a mite peckish.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.943
What does thatmean?

18:39.030 --> 18:42.425
It means I'm hungry.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.471
- I can't read this.
- No?

18:47.517 --> 18:50.129
Oh, that says,
"March '09 accounts payable."

18:50.216 --> 18:52.131
- Oh!
- Hmm?

18:52.218 --> 18:55.046
This, this is just ridiculous.
This is delicious.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.832
[laughing]
Thank you.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.399
Let's hope you can keep
the quality up

18:59.486 --> 19:01.227
with the new boss.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.664
Abigail seems more concerned
about the money than the menu.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.145
Won't be a problem, I promise.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.851
For God's sake.
Did you try this?

19:16.938 --> 19:18.548
You don't like Abigail much,
do you?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.333
- 'Well.'
- Do it over.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.988
You're obviously
very talented.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.687
You should've struck out
on your own a long time ago

19:26.774 --> 19:28.863
unless there was
some reason to stay.

19:28.950 --> 19:32.258
I didtry to strike out
on my own, actually

19:32.345 --> 19:33.955
couple months ago.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.478
- Failed with style?
- 'I wish.'

19:35.565 --> 19:37.654
State wouldn't
grant me my liquor license.

19:37.741 --> 19:41.354
[chuckles]
No license,
no investors, so..

19:41.441 --> 19:43.356
'Luckily, Jeffrey
took me back again.'

19:43.443 --> 19:44.618
So why not hook up
with him?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.533
He was separated,
available.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.319
[chuckles]
I've never liked
waiting in lines.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.584
Excuse me.
I've got prep work to do.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.717
- Thanks for lunch.
- Uh-huh.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.110
'I didn't see any other loans on
the books. It's a good thing.'

19:59.198 --> 20:01.200
Jeffrey wasn't even taking
a salary the last few months.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.114
He wasn't? Hmm.

20:04.812 --> 20:08.555
We're gonna have to
make a stop on the way back.

20:08.642 --> 20:09.991
[Wayne sighs]

20:12.994 --> 20:14.909
Huh. Magic brownies.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.740
This is more...clean-cut
than I'd expected.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.959
Yeah, medical pot,
it's a growth industry.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.657
[Josh]
'First timers, huh?'

20:23.744 --> 20:25.789
I'll tell you the same thing
I tell all the newbies.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.269
go for today's specials.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.531
Sure, they're
a couple bucks more

20:28.618 --> 20:30.272
but between you and me
and the wall

20:30.359 --> 20:32.970
it's the freshest herb we got.
Plus it's locally grown.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.494
Who doesn't wanna support
local farmers?

20:34.581 --> 20:36.583
CBI. Where's your boss?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.541
Uh, Mr. Horlick?
I couldn't say.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.198
But, uh, our permits are all
up to date by the book, 100%.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.375
Well, Mr. Horlick's a suspect
in a murder investigation, Josh

20:46.462 --> 20:48.899
so you if you know where he is,
you should tell us right now.

20:48.986 --> 20:52.033
Is, uh, there a problem here?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.730
We're here about
Jeffrey Barge.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.994
Who? Oh. Oh, yeah.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.953
Yeah, Jeff. Sure.
Sure. What about him?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.737
Jeffrey died yesterday.

21:00.824 --> 21:05.002
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I saw that
on the news. Wow. Heavy.

21:05.089 --> 21:09.050
I mean, boom, he's here.
He's gone.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.792
And how about that?
Life, huh?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.620
We know you lent him money,
Mr. Horlick.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.970
Well, how do you know that?
I mean, who says?

21:16.057 --> 21:17.580
I'll take that as a yes.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.888
Frosty one, aren't we?
I like it.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.369
You like jail, too?

21:23.456 --> 21:25.196
Yeah, that's right.
Kevin told us everything.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.025
It's about time
you did as well.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.158
Fine.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.029
I called him
about the money.

21:32.116 --> 21:35.032
Obviously, he drew some sinister
and incorrect implications

21:35.119 --> 21:36.338
from our conversation

21:36.425 --> 21:39.298
but it was all
a big misunderstanding.

21:39.385 --> 21:42.083
Chalk it up to my,
my poor communication skills.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.389
I think you communicate
very well.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.999
Yes, you do.
You have sleazebag

21:45.086 --> 21:46.740
written across your forehead
in big letters.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.481
Why would I kill Jeff?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.744
You don't off someone
who can pay you back.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.615
I mean, the guy practically
lived at the Ritz.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.138
What are you talking about?
Jeff was broke.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.924
Yeah, that's what he wanted me
to think, too.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.622
But I got a buddy who works
security at the hotel.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.408
He saw the deadbeat
staying there a bunch of times.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.540
You don't stay there unless
your pockets are padded.

22:06.629 --> 22:10.459
I'd like to take yousometime,
thaw you out a little bit.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.331
Yeah, that'll happen.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.119
We got something.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.947
Jeffrey stayed at the Ritz
over a dozen times

22:20.034 --> 22:22.558
in the past two months,
paid in cash every time.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.168
Looks like an affair.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.214
But Jeffrey and his wife
lived separate lives.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.998
Why would he care
if there was a record of it?

22:28.085 --> 22:29.609
Maybe his partner cared.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.088
Because she's married.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.829
She had the money.
She paid for the room

22:32.916 --> 22:35.179
but she paid in cash so
her husband wouldn't find out.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.617
Keep digging.
Find out who the woman was.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.362
[indistinct chatter]

22:45.973 --> 22:48.192
Mmm. Next round's
tomorrow, huh?

22:49.890 --> 22:51.892
Keep workin'.
You'll get there.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.373
Merci beaucoup.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.201
Arliss.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.247
[Patrick]
'Careful, careful.'

23:01.858 --> 23:04.252
Oh, that smells good.
What is that?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.080
Knock yourself out.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.343
It's not for the competition.
It's my lunch.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.736
I'd advise against that.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.651
Don't listen to him.
He's a coward.

23:11.738 --> 23:14.175
- Is he?
- It's the Red Savina pepper.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.351
- It's kinda spicy.
- 'Kind of?'

23:16.438 --> 23:18.048
It's the hottest pepper
known to man. Trust me.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.615
Leave it alone.

23:19.702 --> 23:22.488
It's good on everything
meat, fruit, soups.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.491
Not that any of the people
would know. Babies.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.493
Well, I'd love a little try
of that. Thank you.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.713
Mr. Jane,
our chefs are extremely busy.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.498
Would you mind coming back
another time?

23:32.585 --> 23:35.196
You're quite the ghoul,
aren't you, Duesterberg?

23:35.283 --> 23:37.154
Dragging on
this meaningless contest

23:37.241 --> 23:38.808
after a man
has been killed.

23:38.895 --> 23:42.551
This contest, Mr. Jane,
is an affirmation of life.

23:42.638 --> 23:45.728
It's a testament that
appetite still exists

23:45.815 --> 23:46.947
even in the face of death.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.514
And you need the money.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.298
- Time for you to go.
- Fine.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.257
I have all the information
I need, thank you very much.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.564
He lies. He hasn't asked
one single question.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.871
Why would I? I can learn
everything I need to learn

23:57.958 --> 24:00.308
from watching you all cook.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.876
You, for example,

24:02.963 --> 24:05.966
use lemon to the point
of excess.

24:06.053 --> 24:09.535
'Tart, aggressive flavors,
sublimated aggression'

24:09.622 --> 24:12.276
'toward an important figure
in your life.'

24:12.363 --> 24:13.887
Obviously,
you're a daddy's girl

24:13.974 --> 24:14.975
so I'm gonna go
with mother.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.498
No, let me correct that..

24:18.369 --> 24:19.806
'...stepmother.'

24:20.720 --> 24:22.199
'Ludo!'

24:22.286 --> 24:24.114
You were adopted, no?

24:24.201 --> 24:26.160
No. I wasn't.

24:26.247 --> 24:29.250
Took a shot. Moving on.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
You were having an affair
with Jeffrey.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.689
'Weren't you?'

24:33.776 --> 24:35.082
What?

24:35.169 --> 24:36.910
You can tell all this
by the food?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.564
[Patrick]
'Well, they cooked together
every day'

24:38.651 --> 24:40.914
yet their kitchen
rhythms are off.

24:41.001 --> 24:44.744
They're bashing into each other,
getting in each other's way.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.050
You're not paying enough
attention to her, Arliss.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.269
No wonder she strayed.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.923
That's nonsense.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.969
Really? Then why did
your wife have her father put

24:53.056 --> 24:55.581
the state's best police force
on this case?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.017
Look at her, Arliss.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.453
'She's made no attempt'

24:58.540 --> 25:00.499
no attempt at all
to deny it.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.284
Is it true?

25:03.371 --> 25:05.025
- I..
- So I take it you know

25:05.112 --> 25:06.722
about Julia's affair
with the victim now.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.289
Oh, roger that.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.863
Jeff and I got together
about five months ago

25:16.950 --> 25:19.169
after he separated
from his wife.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.825
[Patrick]
'But he ended it.'

25:22.912 --> 25:24.131
Yes.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.046
When?

25:26.133 --> 25:28.004
The night before he died.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.180
'I went to his room
at the resort.'

25:30.267 --> 25:33.357
'He was drunk. I thought
he was trying to get sober'

25:33.444 --> 25:36.056
but I guess
not that night.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.449
Jeff didn't
handle stress well.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.669
Must have made you angry.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.280
No. I accepted it.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.109
I loved him.

25:46.196 --> 25:49.852
But he was a drunk.
Better left alone.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.637
Wise of you.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.422
I asked for a glass
of water.

25:54.509 --> 25:58.774
I'm sure it'll be here
in a minute.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.951
You think I'm entitled
and snippy and rich.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.562
My father's a senator.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.912
I don't have to take crap
from people like you.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.304
I'm just trying to figure out

26:07.391 --> 26:09.263
who killed Jeffrey Barge,
that's all.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.656
I didn't kill him.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.136
I don't believe you, Julia,
not yet.

26:13.223 --> 26:14.616
[sighs]

26:14.703 --> 26:16.923
I really need
that glass of water.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.142
I'll get it.

26:19.229 --> 26:22.493
We still have a few more
questions for you.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.017
[Patrick]
'Lisbon!'

26:24.104 --> 26:26.019
9-1-1.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.108
Julia? Julia?

26:28.195 --> 26:31.154
Julia. Can you hear me?

26:31.241 --> 26:33.374
Are you on medication?

26:33.461 --> 26:35.071
Come on. Answer.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.770
How many fingers
am I holding up?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.598
'Julia!'

26:44.733 --> 26:46.692
[Teresa]
Yes. Uh-huh.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.390
I know. Yes.

26:49.477 --> 26:55.178
Mr. Attorney General, sir,
I.. I-I understand completely.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.267
I will.

26:57.354 --> 27:00.140
She's straightening.
Straightening her desk.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.445
Uh-oh.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.012
Absolutely.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.362
Coroner's office
says it was ricin poisoning

27:05.449 --> 27:06.886
uh, just like Jeffrey.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.670
Guess they were both
poisoned at the hotel.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.239
Oh, crap.
Is she straightening?

27:12.326 --> 27:14.850
Victim was a senator's daughter.
AG must be livid.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.636
Ugh. It's not our fault.
Ricin takes hours to kick in.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.028
[Wayne]
'Yeah, tell it to the AG.'

27:19.115 --> 27:20.639
[sighs]
What's going on
with the search?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.423
Local sheriff's working on it

27:22.510 --> 27:24.077
taking every food and liquid
off the resort to be tested.

27:24.164 --> 27:27.602
Resort, the contest,
it's all been shut down.

27:27.689 --> 27:31.127
News flash. The AG wants
this case closed now.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.346
Well, we've got
two dead married lovers.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.739
I'd say the killer's a spouse.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.262
Let's start with that.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.440
[Kimball]
There he is.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.531
Cinnamon,
sage and coriander

27:43.618 --> 27:45.881
a squeeze of lemon,
then butter.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.276
No, no garlic.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.321
Not at all. Ciao.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.193
Idiot.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.543
Your wife just died, and you're
talking about recipes?

27:55.630 --> 27:57.197
What would you have me do?

27:57.284 --> 27:59.286
Sir, we'd like to discuss
your wife's estate.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.592
Yes. Sorry.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.421
Idiots. Garlic.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.380
So Julia had money.
So what?

28:06.467 --> 28:08.077
Well, you stand to inherit
all of it, isn't that right?

28:08.164 --> 28:09.644
Yes. So?

28:09.731 --> 28:11.211
Your wife and her lover
are now both dead

28:11.298 --> 28:13.604
killed the same way. That makes
you our number one guy.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.041
Or number two, I'd say.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.216
Have you talked to Abigail yet?

28:16.303 --> 28:17.696
[Wayne]
'Why?'

28:17.783 --> 28:19.610
Ask her about the fight
she and Jeffrey had

28:19.698 --> 28:21.438
at the Fairplex Market
two weeks ago.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.701
It was quite a scene.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.441
You didn't think
to mention this earlier?

28:24.528 --> 28:27.270
Interrogation focuses the mind.
What can I say?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.837
Except you're lying.

28:28.924 --> 28:31.187
Jeffrey hadn't seen his wife
in months.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.886
If Abigail said that,
she'sthe liar.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.281
The market clerk
confirmed the story.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.414
You were in contact with Jeff,
and you were fighting.

28:40.501 --> 28:41.981
Look, I did not kill Jeffrey

28:42.068 --> 28:44.026
if that's what
you're getting at.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.768
'I didn't even know
about this thing with Julia.'

28:46.855 --> 28:48.465
What were you fighting about?

28:48.552 --> 28:50.685
You've really changed
your look, Abigail.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.034
'Haven't you?'

28:52.121 --> 28:53.732
Not that you don't
look lovely now.

28:53.819 --> 28:58.214
It's just this old look, uh,
accentuated your assets.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.739
My husband just died, okay?

29:00.826 --> 29:03.306
You're still putting in time
with the make-up though, I see.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.439
So appearance is important
to you.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.832
What are you getting at?

29:06.919 --> 29:08.311
She's put on 5 or 6 pounds

29:08.398 --> 29:10.009
doesn't fit into
the sleek outfits anymore

29:10.096 --> 29:11.401
so she wears this.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.316
She's pregnant. Right?

29:13.403 --> 29:15.449
'Congratulations.
First trimester.'

29:16.580 --> 29:18.234
Jeff's child, right?

29:18.974 --> 29:20.106
[sighs]

29:21.150 --> 29:22.456
Right?

29:25.502 --> 29:29.245
A few months ago, he came by
to pick up some stuff.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.120
Things happened.

29:38.037 --> 29:40.300
And two weeks ago,
I took a pregnancy test.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.346
How did he take the news
of impending fatherhood?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.741
Okay.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.961
That's what you were
fighting about.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.138
I don't know why
I didn't tell you.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.794
I've been, uh..

29:57.621 --> 29:58.797
...confused.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.323
My parents don't even know.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.152
[sighs]

30:06.239 --> 30:09.068
Do us a favor, Abigail.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.721
We're gonna need to search
your house.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.899
Save us all some time
and grant us permission.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.117
[birds chirping]

30:20.209 --> 30:21.689
Did you know
a full-grown elephant

30:21.776 --> 30:25.432
can eat up to 495 pounds
of food per day?

30:25.519 --> 30:29.044
Could you at least
pretend to be helping?

30:29.131 --> 30:30.698
Got somethin'.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.395
Found this in the garage.

30:32.482 --> 30:33.832
Nice work.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.008
And we care about
a bag of beans why?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
Castor beans.
They're used to make ricin.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.663
Ah, of course.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.319
Naughty Abigail.

30:45.147 --> 30:48.934
We found traces of ricin
in Julia's favorite red pepper.

30:49.021 --> 30:51.632
Her death was not accidental.

30:51.719 --> 30:55.679
Both her and your husband
were specifically targeted.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.507
Together with the castor
beans we found

30:57.594 --> 30:59.031
it's not looking good for you.

30:59.118 --> 31:02.425
My client denies any involvement
in these killings.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.427
She bore no malice
towards her husband

31:04.514 --> 31:05.951
or Ms. St. Germain.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.648
No malice
toward her alcoholic

31:07.735 --> 31:10.520
and fiscally irresponsible
husband and his lover?

31:10.607 --> 31:13.262
'She was not aware
of that relationship'

31:13.349 --> 31:15.874
nor did she ever set foot
in that resort.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.137
- Which you can't prove.
- I didn't do this..

31:18.224 --> 31:19.965
Then how do you explain
the castor beans in your house?

31:20.052 --> 31:21.488
She had no knowledge of them.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.359
That's convenient.

31:23.446 --> 31:27.363
This is a grieving widow,
a pregnant, grieving widow.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.626
'You think that a jury
is going to convict'

31:29.713 --> 31:32.586
on this circumstantial Traif?

31:32.673 --> 31:35.154
We can make this stick,
and you know it.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.243
Believe me, you will feel
much better if you..

31:37.330 --> 31:38.505
[phone ringing]

31:38.592 --> 31:40.028
Would you excuse me?

31:42.639 --> 31:47.296
What?

31:47.383 --> 31:49.429
- What emergency?
- Follow me.

31:49.516 --> 31:50.909
Jane, I don't really
have time for this.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.693
I was working on getting
a confession.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.477
- This is far more important.
- What is?

31:54.564 --> 31:56.915
Agents, welcome.
It's such a relief to know

31:57.002 --> 31:58.133
that the killer
has been caught.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.179
Just doing our job.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.355
And thank you for coming to
this little memorial dinner.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.530
Dinner?

32:03.617 --> 32:06.402
Honoring Jeffrey and Julia.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.926
We're having dinner?

32:08.013 --> 32:09.579
Gotta eat.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.888
I certainly hope
you enjoy yourself.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.935
It should be delicious.
Excuse me.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.285
Those serviettes
are horrifying.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.417
You have five seconds
to tell me what's going on.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.419
First, we need a drink.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.160
Is it that bad?

32:27.989 --> 32:30.513
It's lovely.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.732
- '...finely chopped.'
- 'We're gonna need more soup.'

32:33.168 --> 32:34.778
Not bad, Ludo.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.302
Can we get
the bowls ready?

32:36.389 --> 32:37.999
You shouldn't be here.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.523
Yeah, you're probably right.
You gonna make me leave?

32:40.610 --> 32:41.872
I hope not.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.439
Excuse me.

32:43.526 --> 32:44.875
Oh, excuse me.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.225
I thought you'd be
a little more grateful.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.009
I did just catch
your friend's killer.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.533
We're grateful.
Just a little busy.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.145
Is that it?

32:53.232 --> 32:54.973
- Oh, that smells great.
- Not now, s'il vous plait.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.017
Okay, okay.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.673
Oh, oops! Whoa! Oops!

32:59.760 --> 33:02.415
Fire! Fire! Fire!

33:03.416 --> 33:06.158
Quick! Aah!

33:06.245 --> 33:08.073
Whoa! Ah!

33:08.160 --> 33:11.337
You know, I-I'm just gonna
leave you guys with that.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.816
Aah!

33:16.820 --> 33:18.692
Alright, everyone, please.

33:18.779 --> 33:21.477
Lift your glass.

33:21.564 --> 33:26.265
To Jeffrey and Julia,
friends, colleagues

33:26.352 --> 33:29.703
titans in the culinary world

33:29.790 --> 33:32.706
'you will not be
soon forgotten.'

33:32.793 --> 33:34.012
- Salud.
- Salud.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.014
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.320
Ahh.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.061
Mm-hmm.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.454
To begin,
we have a melon soup

33:41.541 --> 33:45.371
'Prosciutto di Parma,
mint and basil.'

33:45.458 --> 33:47.199
Mmm.

33:47.286 --> 33:50.289
A reinterpretation
of one of Julia's specialties.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.073
Bon appetite.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.683
Thank you.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.818
Come on. Don't let
your Midwestern taste buds

33:57.905 --> 33:59.167
'hold you back.'

34:01.996 --> 34:03.258
[coughing]

34:03.345 --> 34:05.565
Oh, chef.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.263
- What is this spice?
- 'Spice?'

34:08.350 --> 34:12.572
[coughing]
I like a little heat,
but this is overpowering.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.661
Whoa.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.141
We didn't add any heat.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.838
Whew! That would be me.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.014
Sorry.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.147
Fire! Fire!

34:24.453 --> 34:26.194
The Red Savina pepper

34:26.281 --> 34:29.415
ah, I got it
from Julia's pantry.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.460
I thought
it would be appropriate

34:31.547 --> 34:34.072
'and I'm just mad
for heat, so..'

34:34.159 --> 34:35.682
'Obviously, I was
a little heavy-handed.'

34:35.769 --> 34:38.641
My-my apologies.

34:38.728 --> 34:39.990
What's the trouble, Eliza?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.036
I don't, um..

34:42.123 --> 34:43.907
I don't feel well.
I should go.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.518
What's the problem?

34:45.605 --> 34:48.782
[Eliza]
'Uh, the peppers,
it didn't go down well.'

34:48.869 --> 34:50.479
The pepper?
What's wrong with the pepper?

34:50.566 --> 34:52.394
If you don't wanna talk
about it here

34:52.481 --> 34:53.526
we can take it down
to headquarters.

34:53.613 --> 34:54.831
How long can we keep her there?

34:54.918 --> 34:55.919
48 hours.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.573
Wow, that's a stretch of time.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.011
I have to leave.
I have to leave right now.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.709
[Patrick]
'No, that would
be rude. I don't think so.'

35:02.796 --> 35:04.493
What is wrong with you?

35:04.580 --> 35:08.628
We all have to go
to the hospital right now.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.151
[Teresa]
'What for?'

35:10.238 --> 35:14.155
The pepper...I think
it was poisoned.

35:14.242 --> 35:17.332
I-I-I saw Ludo put
something into it.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.073
I did not. How dare you!

35:19.160 --> 35:21.467
Maybe you're just cramping
a little? Just a little--

35:21.554 --> 35:24.948
Alright, alright.
I poisoned Julia's pepper.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.211
And Jeffrey's gin.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.648
Yes, yes! Just bring me
to a hospital.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.606
No, hospitals
are terrible germ factories.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.956
- 'You don't wanna go there.'
- Are you insane?

35:33.043 --> 35:35.698
Relax. We knew about the ricin
in the pepper.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.439
We just didn't know
who put it there.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.224
I don't understand.
Are we poisoned?

35:39.311 --> 35:41.443
No. I switched the peppers.

35:41.530 --> 35:42.618
[all sighs]

35:42.705 --> 35:43.967
Clever of me.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.186
[whispering]
God.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.582
[sighs]

35:49.669 --> 35:52.672
Okay, so we know that your
restaurant didn't fail, Eliza.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.848
Jeffrey and Julia,
they killed it.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.416
We did some digging
on Julia's father.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.592
He's the one who squashed
your liquor license.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.376
Jeffrey was a drunk.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.074
He needed you in his kitchen,
so he asked his lover

36:04.162 --> 36:07.774
if she could have her big,
powerful daddy do her a favor.

36:07.861 --> 36:11.125
He didn't call you that night to talk about recipes, did he?

36:11.212 --> 36:15.825
He called to apologize for sabotaging your liquor license,

36:15.912 --> 36:18.915
for ruining any chance you had at opening your own place.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.962
But I..

36:23.790 --> 36:26.488
I am trying to become
a better man.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.970
I am.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.711
He told you what he did

36:31.798 --> 36:35.584
and then you,
decided to take your revenge.

36:37.934 --> 36:40.894
So you got some castor beans,
mixed up a batch of ricin

36:40.981 --> 36:42.983
and went to the resort
to find him.

36:47.683 --> 36:48.728
Yeah.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.469
[scoffs]

36:50.556 --> 36:52.253
I went to his room.

36:53.689 --> 36:54.821
[knock on door]

37:00.522 --> 37:02.002
Oh, Jeff.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.788
I accept your apology.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.750
Let me just, wash up.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.841
[Eliza]
He was such a fool.

37:14.928 --> 37:18.192
Like I was gonna let that go?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.803
Like we were just gonna make up and all be friends again?

37:20.890 --> 37:23.893
That's just...ridiculous.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.290
[Teresa]
And then you
went to the pantry

37:29.377 --> 37:30.726
and, uh, you found
Julia's pepper

37:30.813 --> 37:32.989
and you dosed that, too.

37:35.862 --> 37:39.996
One time I was cleaning shrimp
for Jeffrey.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.737
There were, like,
40 pounds of it

37:41.824 --> 37:44.392
and it was still half frozen,
but that was the job.

37:46.699 --> 37:50.877
'I couldn't feel my hands.
It was so cold.'

37:50.964 --> 37:55.011
I realized I was cutting
the flesh off my own fingers.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.755
Carving it off.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.195
And I didn't mind

38:06.327 --> 38:08.024
because Jeffrey
had a vision.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.208
I had a vision.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.738
And he said, go, babe.
You deserve your own place.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.352
But he was lying.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.314
Him and his..

38:38.490 --> 38:41.144
...rich bitch girlfriend.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.451
Like I was gonna
let that go.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.331
He said, I'm sorry.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.813
I'm sorry.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.124
I'm sorry?

39:05.995 --> 39:08.128
What good is that?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.660
[Abigail]
'Agent Lisbon, a word.'

39:20.314 --> 39:23.099
- How can I help you?
- You framed me.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.275
You put those castor beans
in my house, didn't you?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.886
Ma'am, on my word of honor

39:26.973 --> 39:30.193
I did not know that
those beans were planted.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.544
Mr. Jane was responsible.
I should've known.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.110
I should've stopped him,
and I didn't

39:34.197 --> 39:36.939
and for that,
I am really sorry.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.680
Why?

39:38.767 --> 39:40.552
He thought in order to catch
the killer

39:40.639 --> 39:42.902
that somebody else had to be
suspected of the crime.

39:42.989 --> 39:46.384
He's probably right.
I know you must be angry.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.907
[sighs]

39:47.994 --> 39:50.997
Trying to leave
the anger behind.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.956
Though that's pretty much
impossible, isn't it?

39:54.043 --> 39:55.218
It's hard.

39:55.305 --> 39:56.916
[sighs]

39:57.003 --> 39:59.832
Anyway, thank you
for being honest with me.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.707
Tell Mr. Jane he's
a mean, irresponsible sadist.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.448
'Oh, I will.'

40:10.799 --> 40:12.410
Ms. Barge?

40:16.109 --> 40:18.981
Living with an alcoholic
is hard.

40:19.068 --> 40:22.332
Some never change.
They don't even want to.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.857
But your husband checked
into treatment two weeks ago

40:24.944 --> 40:28.469
right after you told him
about the baby.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.211
I think he wanted to be there
for you and your child.

40:33.039 --> 40:36.738
That's why he ended
the relationship with Julia.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.437
For what it's worth, it seemed
like he wanted to change.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.790
Thank you.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.621
[dramatic music]

40:53.320 --> 40:55.061
It's okay. She's gone.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.020
- Who's gone?
- 'Oh, please.'

40:58.107 --> 41:00.153
Your guilty conscience
is obvious and well deserved.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.548
Meh. Justice can be
a harsh mistress.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.593
Omelets and eggs,
ends to means

41:05.680 --> 41:07.247
all's well that ends well.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.379
A glib answer's no excuse.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.688
Oh, and Abigail said
to tell you

41:13.775 --> 41:15.995
that you are
a mean, irresponsible sadist.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.260
Well, that's pretty accurate.

41:21.696 --> 41:22.828
'You okay?'

41:24.177 --> 41:25.787
