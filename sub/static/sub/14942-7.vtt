WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.703
(Phone rings)

00:03.704 --> 00:06.706
9-1-1. What's your
emergency? (Coughing)

00:06.707 --> 00:08.708
Sir, can you hear me?

00:08.709 --> 00:11.081
Someone... please... Come quick.

00:11.082 --> 00:13.613
Where are you, sir?
Can you hear me, sir?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.014
Sir?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.747
Dispatch, I need a
unit to fishtown now.

00:17.748 --> 00:20.650
Sir? Stay with me, sir.

00:20.651 --> 00:23.253
Sir? Can you hear me, sir?

00:23.254 --> 00:25.056
Sir?

00:30.061 --> 00:32.062
(Lacey) So who's the guy?

00:32.063 --> 00:35.065
What guy? Come on. That's,
like, your third shade so far.

00:35.066 --> 00:37.367
You're never this
neurotic about lipstick.

00:37.368 --> 00:39.369
It's nothing. It's,
uh, it's a colleague.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.212
We met on a case.

00:42.213 --> 00:45.575
Like how dad and Kate met on a case?
(Chuckles) You're evil, you know that?

00:45.576 --> 00:48.047
We're having coffee. That's all.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.250
What's he do? He's an FBI agent.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.083
Cool. What's his name? Why?

00:53.084 --> 00:56.186
To look him up, of
course. (Cell phone beeps)

00:56.187 --> 00:58.188
Derek ames. Oh, that's work.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.291
We gotta go. Get
your stuff together.

01:01.292 --> 01:04.134
What about your coffee date?

01:04.135 --> 01:06.466
I think I might still
be able to make it.

01:06.467 --> 01:10.140
Derek ames. FBI. He's hot.

01:10.141 --> 01:12.343
(Chuckles)

01:14.305 --> 01:15.805
All right.

01:15.806 --> 01:18.808
(Police radio chatter)

01:18.809 --> 01:23.113
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:23.114 --> 01:25.415
Is there something
wrong with your cell phone

01:25.416 --> 01:27.417
or are you just
playing hard to get?

01:27.418 --> 01:30.420
Why? Derek ames? He left a
message at the office this morning

01:30.421 --> 01:32.662
because he doesn't
have your cell phone.

01:32.663 --> 01:35.825
He says he regrets he can't make coffee.
Damn it! I should've canceled first.

01:35.826 --> 01:38.868
Well, as long as we're back
in high school... (Morris) Hey.

01:38.869 --> 01:41.501
(Sighs) Who found him?

01:41.502 --> 01:44.504
He found himself.
He called 9-1-1.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.636
Did he say what
happened to himself?

01:46.637 --> 01:50.480
He didn't say much of
anything. He expired on the call.

01:50.481 --> 01:53.343
The e.M.T.S were too late.
His name's Jake Brady, 17.

01:53.344 --> 01:56.886
He's from mount airy. Mount
airy's a long way from fishtown.

01:56.887 --> 01:59.649
He's got bruising on his torso,

01:59.650 --> 02:01.721
and I smell alcohol...
Never a good thing.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.654
(Peter) No.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.697
Hmm.

02:08.259 --> 02:10.561
Hand me your U.V. light, please.

02:13.364 --> 02:15.635
(Sam) What the hell?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.707
That is black light paint.

02:17.708 --> 02:21.140
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:21.141 --> 02:23.873
Okay, the plot thickens.

02:23.874 --> 02:26.816
Hey, there's another one.

02:26.817 --> 02:29.619
(Morris) Well, look at that.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.751
(Police radio chatter)

02:31.752 --> 02:34.755
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:51.942 --> 02:55.475
(Peter) So this is what
brought Jake to fishtown

02:55.476 --> 02:57.477
on a Friday night... a rave.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.479
Shouldn't there be a
time machine in here?

02:59.480 --> 03:02.552
Isn't this something that happened,
like, 20 years ago? (Can rattles)

03:02.553 --> 03:06.316
The party didn't stop just 'cause
you got old, bud. (Peter laughs)

03:06.317 --> 03:08.318
You do mean "we," don't you?

03:08.319 --> 03:11.321
(Chuckles) (Sam) We need
to secure this entire area.

03:11.322 --> 03:13.323
(Man) Okay. Hundreds
of kids dancing till dawn.

03:13.324 --> 03:16.896
Not one of them sees
Jake on their way out, dying?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.898
They're too drunk
or too high to care.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.301
I give you the "y" generation.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.934
Let's go, bud. Let's
go tell his parents.

03:27.238 --> 03:29.979
(Woman) It can't be him.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.983
We let him sleep in on
Saturdays. I'll go get him.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.288
It's not Jake.

03:38.289 --> 03:40.290
We talked about this.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.522
About what? He
mentioned the party.

03:42.523 --> 03:47.297
I told him I don't want him anywhere near
those freaks. Did that talk get physical?

03:47.298 --> 03:48.558
Excuse me?

03:48.559 --> 03:51.331
Your son had a lot of
bruises on his chest.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.434
Like I said, it isn't him.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.506
Mr. Brady... He knows better.

03:56.507 --> 03:58.908
I think you need
to prepare yourself.

03:58.909 --> 04:01.441
Harvey, his bed's still made.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.375
(Voice breaks) What
happened to my little boy?

04:10.581 --> 04:13.283
Uh, Jake Brady's tox
showed signs of a drug,

04:13.284 --> 04:15.254
but we ruled out
ecstasy, "special k,"

04:15.255 --> 04:17.256
and other rave-related
substances.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.459
Plus, his blood alcohol's .09.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.293
Wouldn't be the first time a kid
o.D.'Ed at a rave. It would be my first.

04:23.294 --> 04:26.596
Well, these pills may
have something to do with it.

04:26.597 --> 04:29.339
The surface is too
degraded to tell if there are

04:29.340 --> 04:31.801
any identifying marks, so I will
take it to the lab... I'll take those.

04:31.802 --> 04:35.675
And s... you don't think I can
handle it? I don't think it would help.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.747
If our tox didn't
hit on anything,

04:37.748 --> 04:40.279
these are most
likely designer drugs,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.513
and they won't be in our system.

04:43.514 --> 04:46.055
Wait. Wh-whose
system would they be in?

04:46.056 --> 04:49.619
These are people's
lives, not pieces of paper.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.621
If this file that you
sent without clearance

04:51.622 --> 04:55.025
had fallen into the wrong hands,
someone could've gotten killed.

04:57.868 --> 05:01.070
Now go make this right.

05:01.071 --> 05:04.404
(Mouths word)

05:04.405 --> 05:06.976
Megan. I was just
in the neighborhood.

05:06.977 --> 05:09.038
Thought I'd stop
by and say hello.

05:09.039 --> 05:10.710
Mistake?

05:10.711 --> 05:13.913
No. I'm, um, sorry about
the coffee this morning.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.817
We had a foul-up and, uh...

05:19.319 --> 05:21.521
I'm kidding. I was
gonna cancel myself.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.322
I'm on a case.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.456
We found these on a 17 year
old who died at a rave this morning.

05:26.457 --> 05:29.058
High school. Amazing
we all survived.

05:29.059 --> 05:31.361
Sounds like you're
no stranger to raves.

05:31.362 --> 05:35.405
I take it you were? I was
too busy being a nerd.

05:35.406 --> 05:39.439
So tell me, what is it that
I can do that you can't?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.372
Not much. Except tap
into the p.C./h.I.D.T.A.,

05:42.373 --> 05:45.615
since it is
thefederaldrug database.

05:45.616 --> 05:48.378
You've been doing your homework.

05:48.379 --> 05:52.622
I'll see what I can
do. (Clears throat)

05:52.623 --> 05:54.724
Anything else?

05:54.725 --> 05:57.987
Yes. You can call me once
you've gotten the results.

05:57.988 --> 05:59.730
Here's my cell.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.135
Thank you, agent ames.
At your service, Dr. Hunt.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.002
(Sam) Oh, come on, Peter.

06:13.003 --> 06:16.546
You were definitely one of the cool
kids. You say that like it's a bad thing.

06:16.547 --> 06:20.650
Well, it is if you weren't one of the cool
kids. Let me guess which one you were.

06:20.651 --> 06:23.082
What is this, an intervention?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.816
It's a meeting of the committee of where's
my cause of death? I'm working on it.

06:26.817 --> 06:28.017
Ethan?

06:28.018 --> 06:32.061
(Clears throat) Jake
has bruising on his torso.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.023
He also has ligature marks

06:34.024 --> 06:37.396
on his wrists in a
patterned impression...

06:37.397 --> 06:38.728
Possible result of restraint.

06:38.729 --> 06:43.032
His skin also shows
indication of livor mortis.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.735
It's fixed with no blanching.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.477
(Ethan) Hmm.

06:47.478 --> 06:50.480
What time did you say
he made that 9-1-1 call?

06:50.481 --> 06:52.482
Uh, 7:14 in the A.M.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.945
About three hours ago. Why?

06:56.647 --> 07:00.089
Because when he made that call,

07:00.090 --> 07:03.593
he'd been dead for
at least four hours.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.094
(Fabric snaps)

07:05.095 --> 07:07.528
♪♪♪

07:11.101 --> 07:14.133
Voice analysis
compared the 9-1-1 call...

07:14.134 --> 07:16.135
(Boy) Someone...
please... Come quick.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.837
To Jake's outgoing message.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.840
Hey, it's Jake. Leave
it. Definitely not him.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.142
And if the great santini
ever gets back to us,

07:23.143 --> 07:25.945
we'll see if he
recognizes the voice.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.948
You'd think he'd be calling
us. This is his son, after all.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.950
You know, take it easy, bud.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.453
You lose a child, and let's see how
you react. (Clicks keyboard keys)

07:34.454 --> 07:35.955
You get anything?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.227
Wait. I'm on Jake's
arentisocial page,

07:38.228 --> 07:40.690
trying to figure out
who threw the rave.

07:40.691 --> 07:43.533
You know, some kid comes to
your party, does your fancy drugs,

07:43.534 --> 07:45.535
and o.D.'S, are
you gonna call it in

07:45.536 --> 07:47.537
or are you gonna
wait till the party's over

07:47.538 --> 07:51.200
and make it somebody else's
problem? Oh, wait, wait, wait.

07:51.201 --> 07:53.703
That's the same
arrow as on the wall.

07:53.704 --> 07:56.105
(Electronica playing)
"Hit jinx with your cell.

07:56.106 --> 07:58.578
She'll text to the
first arrow." Mm.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.910
What ever happened to
hanging out in the basement

08:00.911 --> 08:04.153
with a six-pack of your dad's
beer? (Chuckles) What are you, 100?

08:04.154 --> 08:07.216
It says jinx is holding a
rave in Cleveland tonight.

08:07.217 --> 08:08.918
Not anymore.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.820
(Mouse clicks)

08:10.821 --> 08:13.192
(Todd) So the, uh,
firm signed a new client.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.595
Yeah? Yeah, it's a winery.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.628
Really? Yeah, we're having
a tasting later at the office,

08:18.629 --> 08:21.731
if you're interested. (Scoffs) You will
never hear me turn down a glass of wine.

08:21.732 --> 08:24.073
(Chuckles) Oh. That reminds
me... somebody from...

08:24.074 --> 08:26.936
U.c. Berkeley left a message
on your machine this morning.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.178
Somebody's getting a
late start this morning.

08:29.179 --> 08:32.712
Hey. Oh, thanks for taking
Lacey last night. Appreciate it.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.284
Anything I can do
to help your love life.

08:35.285 --> 08:37.186
(Chuckles)

08:37.187 --> 08:40.189
Okay, I will leave you
two to, uh, compare notes.

08:40.190 --> 08:41.220
Ew.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.623
Yeah. Heads-up
on the rave victim...

08:43.624 --> 08:45.696
Somebody else called 9-1-1.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.532
X-rays confirm no broken bones

08:53.533 --> 08:55.304
under the ligature
marks on his wrists.

08:55.305 --> 08:58.568
So he wasn't dragged.
He died in place.

08:58.569 --> 08:59.869
You find anything?

08:59.870 --> 09:02.872
His stomach's empty, so
nothing to absorb all the alcohol,

09:02.873 --> 09:04.974
and he's got vascular
congestion in his lungs,

09:04.975 --> 09:08.578
all of which support the
theory that he overdosed.

09:08.579 --> 09:10.119
Orsomeoneoverdosed him.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.122
God, I hope Lacey
skips that phase.

09:13.123 --> 09:16.225
Oh, she gon' sneak
out. We all did.

09:16.226 --> 09:19.558
You gon' tell me
you didn't? Only once.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.993
My mother grounded me for two
months and made me learn Latin.

09:23.994 --> 09:25.294
Really?

09:25.295 --> 09:26.896
Ita vero.

09:26.897 --> 09:30.169
(Ames)sine poena nulla Lex.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.872
"Without penalty,
there is no law."

09:32.873 --> 09:35.805
What's Latin for
"why are you here"?

09:35.806 --> 09:38.147
Quare es hic? Quare es hic?

09:38.148 --> 09:41.250
Oh, you two must
be real fun at parties.

09:41.251 --> 09:43.252
I'm guessing that
you're here about the pills

09:43.253 --> 09:46.055
found in Jake's pocket?
It's no newfangled ecstasy.

09:46.056 --> 09:48.217
It's capsias. Capsias?

09:48.218 --> 09:51.220
That's for a.D.H.D.,
not recreational use.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.362
Try telling that to kids
who are huffing glue

09:53.363 --> 09:56.365
and choking themselves for a buzz.
Combined with alcohol, it could be fatal.

09:56.366 --> 09:59.899
We'll rerun the tox on it. It probably
would've popped up on your database.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.601
And you probably could've
called with the results,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.034
and yet, hmm, here you are.

10:05.035 --> 10:07.938
Thought you might
like your evidence back.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.011
So rain check...

10:12.012 --> 10:13.383
Tonight?

10:16.687 --> 10:19.790
Deal.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.331
What?

10:32.332 --> 10:35.304
You pulled me out of
line at the boarding gate.

10:35.305 --> 10:38.839
You gonna reimburse me for
my ticket? (Chuckles) Oh, yeah.

10:41.772 --> 10:44.343
Recognize him? Oh, yeah.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.416
He was that guy who was dancing
with a thousand other people.

10:47.417 --> 10:52.051
He's also the one who got drunk and died at your rave.
So obviously I must have something to do with that.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.954
Here's the thing, jinx...
Somebody made a fake 9-1-1 call

10:54.955 --> 10:57.426
after your party,
pretending to be Jake.

10:57.427 --> 10:59.188
Plus, the body was
propped outside.

10:59.189 --> 11:02.661
I think you wanted to cover
up any connection to your rave.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.264
I don't know anything about it.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.037
Maybe six months for serving
minors will jog your memory.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.399
(Punching bag thuds)

11:11.742 --> 11:15.875
Mr. Brady?

11:15.876 --> 11:16.947
(Thud)

11:19.179 --> 11:21.350
You never called us back.

11:21.351 --> 11:25.314
Esther fainted.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.817
I had to check her
in at the hospital.

11:27.818 --> 11:30.119
So you're working out
your aggression now?

11:30.120 --> 11:33.192
What do you want? Were you aware
that your son was taking capsias?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.125
It's a drug for attention
deficit disorder.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.127
Look, I don't know
who you are, lady,

11:38.128 --> 11:40.299
but Jake never took
the easy way out.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.002
I taught him hard
work and determination.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.004
I built this gym for him.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.437
When his grades
slipped, I got him a tutor.

11:48.438 --> 11:52.441
He was headed for being in
the honor society, just like me.

11:52.442 --> 11:55.114
That's a long way from
high school, Mr. Brady.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.216
I wore this to inspire him.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.288
Perhaps he felt more
pressure than inspiration.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.391
We found pills in his pocket.
Then they were planted there.

12:02.392 --> 12:07.426
Did you really come here to
taint the memory of my son?

12:07.427 --> 12:10.429
Mr. Brady, someone
made a 9-1-1 call,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.431
pretending to be Jake.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.903
You recognize this voice?

12:13.904 --> 12:15.765
(Boy) Someone... please...

12:15.766 --> 12:17.907
Come quick.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.170
(Recorder beeps)

12:23.073 --> 12:24.313
No.

12:24.314 --> 12:27.046
Mr. Brady...

12:27.047 --> 12:31.480
Don't even think about
taking this into your own hands.

12:31.481 --> 12:32.983
Who is it?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.987
Patrick spradlin.

12:37.988 --> 12:41.460
Yeah, I made that call.
Patrick, what did you do?

12:41.461 --> 12:44.433
Nothing. You know, most people
would've stayed with their friend.

12:44.434 --> 12:49.398
You are quite the pal, aren't you? M.E.'S
office found capsias in Jake's system.

12:49.399 --> 12:53.072
Did you give it to him? He was struggling
in English, so I gave him some help.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.404
Planning on studying
at the rave, was he?

12:55.405 --> 12:57.146
I don't know, okay?

12:57.147 --> 12:59.208
I think he just needed to,

12:59.209 --> 13:01.180
you know, cut
loose or something.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.182
I mean, look who he lives with.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.085
Mrs. Spradlin, you weren't
wondering where your son was?

13:06.086 --> 13:08.557
He told me he was
staying at Jake's.

13:08.558 --> 13:11.090
And I was gonna, after
the party. Okay, mom?

13:11.091 --> 13:14.093
A mother's love
is blind, Patrick.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.364
But down the hall,

13:15.365 --> 13:17.426
we have a holding cell
full of upstanding citizens

13:17.427 --> 13:20.369
who won't find you
nearly as charming.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.933
Now you want to
take a walk or talk?

13:26.977 --> 13:29.038
After the party
ended, I came outside

13:29.039 --> 13:31.340
and I saw Jake, and
he wasn't moving.

13:31.341 --> 13:35.514
So... yeah, I freaked,
because he was dead.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.187
I thought maybe the... the
pills and... and the beer...

13:38.188 --> 13:40.189
I-I thought that did it,

13:40.190 --> 13:43.522
so... so I made the call
and I got the hell out of there.

13:43.523 --> 13:48.497
But I'm not the one that hung a sign around
his neck. What are you talking about?

13:48.498 --> 13:51.861
This was... on the school
newspaper's web site

13:51.862 --> 13:53.433
this morning.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.848
(Wheels clattering)

14:10.620 --> 14:12.381
Now that's cold.

14:12.382 --> 14:14.523
Someone cleaned
him up pretty well.

14:14.524 --> 14:18.557
We only found that one trace of black light
paint. Tox screen we sent to the reference lab

14:18.558 --> 14:21.560
came back with low levels of
capsias, so even with alcohol,

14:21.561 --> 14:24.593
it couldn't have killed him,
could it? (Megan) Nope.

14:24.594 --> 14:26.265
Then what did?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.567
You are looking right at it.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.269
(Curtis) Positional asphyxia.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.102
Look, his arms are
bound behind him,

14:33.103 --> 14:35.344
and the extreme neck
flexion over the sign

14:35.345 --> 14:37.246
closed off his airways.

14:37.247 --> 14:39.248
That explains the
blood in the lungs.

14:39.249 --> 14:42.011
I knew that. Which means
the ligature marks on his wrists

14:42.012 --> 14:45.315
directly contributed
to his death. Exactly.

14:47.357 --> 14:51.060
Wait. Why are you
looking at us like that?

14:51.061 --> 14:54.463
I think you both know
where you're headed.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.095
(Sighs)

14:56.096 --> 14:57.927
This just goes on forever.

14:57.928 --> 15:00.499
Yeah, how we gon'
find what tied him up

15:00.500 --> 15:01.971
in all this?

15:01.972 --> 15:03.672
Well, looking probably helps.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.575
So does not talking to
me. You asked the question.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.508
Ugh. Come on. (Chuckles)

15:09.509 --> 15:12.111
I mean, whose idea of a party
is this, anyway? (Stick thuds)

15:12.112 --> 15:15.514
They just play the same
song for ten hours, right?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.987
♪ Ooch, ooch, ooch, ooch,
ooch, ooch, ooch, ooch ♪

15:17.988 --> 15:21.450
(Beatboxing) ♪ milk the dairy
cow, hey! Milk the dairy cow ♪

15:21.451 --> 15:23.122
♪ pull it, pull it,
pull it, milk it ♪

15:23.123 --> 15:25.154
♪ Whoo! Milk it, Whoo!
Milk the dairy cow ♪

15:25.155 --> 15:27.456
♪ eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! ♪
Ethan!

15:27.457 --> 15:28.697
(Grunts)

15:28.698 --> 15:30.099
Sorry.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.301
I never took you
for a raver, man.

15:32.302 --> 15:34.303
Look here, deejay
doofus, I partied.

15:34.304 --> 15:37.336
What'd you do, play
charades? No, I partied.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.707
(Laughs)

15:38.708 --> 15:40.269
(Glass clinks) Doofus.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.641
What? You see what I did there?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.545
I cleared this all away
just so you could see it.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.978
Look at that.

15:48.979 --> 15:51.120
That's teamwork. Mm-hmm.

15:51.121 --> 15:54.483
We're moving? To California?

15:54.484 --> 15:56.125
Possibly.

15:56.126 --> 15:57.956
I-I don't understand.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.528
We live here.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.330
Look, I would be a
professor of criminal law

16:01.331 --> 16:03.562
at boalt law school at Berkeley.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.565
That's one of the top
law schools in the country.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.697
This could be a platform
for books and consulting,

16:08.698 --> 16:10.699
plus, I still get to practice.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.742
Lace, I never thought that
this would happen for me,

16:13.743 --> 16:15.744
you know, but
here it is. (Chuckles)

16:15.745 --> 16:19.078
And we don't have a
lot of time to decide.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.379
What about mom?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.551
This is not her decision, baby.

16:22.552 --> 16:25.054
Have you told her that?
I will, if you're on board.

16:25.055 --> 16:28.617
On board? Leaving
my friends, my life?

16:28.618 --> 16:29.989
Hey.

16:32.262 --> 16:34.193
Look... when I left your mom,

16:34.194 --> 16:36.425
I did absolutely
everything I could

16:36.426 --> 16:38.627
to keep you out
of the proceedings.

16:38.628 --> 16:41.770
Okay? But you're a big girl now,

16:41.771 --> 16:44.403
a-and you get to
have a say in this.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.735
And I'm s-sorry
to spring it on you,

16:46.736 --> 16:50.180
but... here it is.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.714
When would we go?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.086
Soon.

16:57.087 --> 16:59.418
I'm supposed to, uh, fly out,

16:59.419 --> 17:02.751
meet the regents
in a couple of days.

17:02.752 --> 17:05.295
I want you to come with me.

17:12.362 --> 17:14.032
(Beeping)

17:14.033 --> 17:16.705
The skin cells that
we found on the cable

17:16.706 --> 17:18.707
do not belong to Jake,

17:18.708 --> 17:21.740
so if you get a
match, we get our guy.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.742
Problem is, even
the high schoolers

17:23.743 --> 17:26.515
who should be in
this system aren't

17:26.516 --> 17:29.378
because of rehabilitation of minors
laws. In my day, "rehabilitation of minors"

17:29.379 --> 17:31.380
meant the back of
your daddy's hand.

17:31.381 --> 17:34.423
I don't know what is the
problem with kids these days.

17:34.424 --> 17:38.087
(Scoffs) God, why do you
have such a stick up your ass

17:38.088 --> 17:39.758
about kids right
now? (Alert beeps)

17:39.759 --> 17:42.491
Did you get a match?
Well, yes and no.

17:42.492 --> 17:44.493
All these samples
were donated by parents

17:44.494 --> 17:48.066
in case their children were
abducted. It's restricted.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.141
If only we knew someone
who worked missing persons.

18:01.111 --> 18:02.781
(Megan) Mm-hmm.

18:02.782 --> 18:06.485
Oh. Did I get the time wrong?
We're starting a little early.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.517
Our suspect is in
a kidnap database

18:08.518 --> 18:12.191
that the local p.D. Can't access. No
way. It's a violation of the kid's rights,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.594
and it would get me in
a lot of trouble, too, so...

18:15.595 --> 18:19.198
So I guess you're okay
with letting a killer walk.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.669
Three things...

18:20.670 --> 18:23.472
One, guilt does not work on me,

18:23.473 --> 18:26.505
two, you don't know
if this is the killer,

18:26.506 --> 18:29.138
and three, we're not dating,

18:29.139 --> 18:32.441
so you don't get to keep
asking me for things.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.813
Would it help if we were?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.817
(Sheryl crow's
"sideways" playing)

18:42.292 --> 18:44.623
What were you really
like in high school?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.296
Oh, ho, ho. God.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.428
(Inhales sharply) Honest truth?

18:49.429 --> 18:50.859
Mm-hmm.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.901
I was a theater geek.

18:52.902 --> 18:55.164
No, you weren't. Mm-hmm.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.865
Come on. (Laughs)

18:56.866 --> 18:59.338
Oh, yeah. I was a
wannabe Brando.

You sure he's not home?

20:09.839 --> 20:12.841
He said he had a ton of
work to do before he can go.

20:12.842 --> 20:15.444
Why? What are you going
to do? I'm gonna kill him.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.616
Mom... as usual, he
doesn't have the decency

20:17.617 --> 20:20.719
to tell me what's going on. It's
not like you'll never see me again.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.421
Wait a minute.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.423
Do you want to go?

20:24.424 --> 20:26.425
No.

But he said it could
be a big deal for him.

20:29.259 --> 20:32.261
And you've got a guy now. No, I
don't have a guy. That was not a guy.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.304

This is your home.

Please tell me you
don't want to go.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.917
I don't.

20:48.918 --> 20:51.920
But I also didn't want my
parents to get divorced,

20:51.921 --> 20:54.783
and that happened anyway.

20:54.784 --> 20:58.827
I haven't had a real
home in a long time, mom.

20:58.828 --> 21:02.462
And all I know is that
that wasn't my fault.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.766
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.839
(Sighs)

21:13.573 --> 21:16.676

21:19.379 --> 21:21.850
(Girl) You must be here
about that awful picture of Jake.

21:21.851 --> 21:24.413
I just took it down.
(Morris) Who are you?

21:24.414 --> 21:26.385
Maxine hall, editor in chief.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.057
So you put yourself
on the front cover?

21:29.058 --> 21:30.989
States were yesterday.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.061
But obviously that
doesn't matter now.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.824
I can't believe what
happened to Jake.

21:35.825 --> 21:38.527
Who took that
photo? I don't know.

21:38.528 --> 21:40.799
Someone accessed the
server by hacking my computer.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.831
Did you know Jake?

21:42.832 --> 21:45.033
Not personally, but
he was everywhere.

21:45.034 --> 21:47.035
Wide receiver on
the football team,

21:47.036 --> 21:49.938
debate club, student gov. You know
of anyone who wanted to hurt him?

21:49.939 --> 21:53.882
It's high school. Some
people thought he was a bully.

21:53.883 --> 21:55.744
Others were just jealous.

21:55.745 --> 21:59.548
So you think whoever
took the picture killed Jake?

21:59.549 --> 22:01.820
Well, maybe. That's
why we're here.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.792
We have to confiscate
your computer

22:03.793 --> 22:07.626
in order to try and figure that out.
Well, can I at least get an exclusive?

22:07.627 --> 22:08.958
No.

22:13.102 --> 22:15.834
Did you get anything
else off those skin cells?

22:15.835 --> 22:19.337
How was your date?
Don't want to talk about it.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.610
So Derek ames was no help?

22:21.611 --> 22:25.073
Right. Uh, I found
something, actually.

22:25.074 --> 22:27.916
Chromosome breakdown is "x-x-y."

22:27.917 --> 22:30.018
A hermaphrodite?

22:30.019 --> 22:31.720
No, but same ballpark.

22:31.721 --> 22:34.883
It's klinefelter's syndrome.
It only affects boys.

22:34.884 --> 22:37.786
They're born with both male
and female chromosomes,

22:37.787 --> 22:39.788
and they often exhibit
feminine features

22:39.789 --> 22:41.990
like gynecomastia.
Increased breast tissue.

22:41.991 --> 22:43.992
So I'd say we're
looking for someone

22:43.993 --> 22:47.095
who Jake picked on at school.

22:47.096 --> 22:50.869
The school doesn't have genetic
information on the students.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.941
This is the best
we're gonna do...

22:52.942 --> 22:54.873
A high school
newspaper's computer.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.075
It's got every student's
class photo on it.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.078
Now since the killer knew
how to hack into the site,

23:00.079 --> 23:02.080
I pulled up the
computer club first.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.484
Figured it would be
the best place to start.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.016
How was your date last night?

23:08.017 --> 23:10.759
Don't want to talk about it.
Mm. I've had dates like that.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.693
Doubt it. Maxine hall,
editor of the paper.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.465
Early admission... upenn.

23:16.466 --> 23:18.967
I thought you said
it had to be a boy.

23:18.968 --> 23:22.000
I'm just curious as to
what it takes these days...

23:22.001 --> 23:25.774
"swim team, newspaper,
Greek, French, computer club."

23:25.775 --> 23:27.936
Hmm. I'm starting
to feel inadequate.

23:27.937 --> 23:29.978
Starting? (Laughs)

23:29.979 --> 23:33.782
You were a laugh riot in
high school, weren't you?

23:33.783 --> 23:36.144
(Laughs)

23:36.145 --> 23:37.646
Huh.

23:37.647 --> 23:39.648
(Clicks mouse)
I'd start with him.

23:39.649 --> 23:42.020
(Morris) "David Morton."

23:42.021 --> 23:44.723
Are you sure you don't
want a parent present?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.025
(Effeminate voice) They
don't give a damn about me.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.498
Your parents registered you
with a kidnapping database

23:49.499 --> 23:50.999
when you were born.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.132
They do give a damn. Past
tense. Look what they got.

23:54.133 --> 23:58.136
We found your d.N.A. On
the cord used to tie up Jake.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.669
You want to tell
us how it got there?

24:00.670 --> 24:02.741
I think it's what you
people call "transfer."

24:02.742 --> 24:06.174
I think it's what we call evidence
that you did it. That's right.

24:06.175 --> 24:10.118
People make fun of my looks,
my voice, the way I dress.

24:10.119 --> 24:11.980
And you know what?

24:11.981 --> 24:15.023
I see that all as a
credit to my creativity.

24:15.024 --> 24:18.557
And Jake? Every single
morning, he'd call me a freak,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.559
knock the books out of my hands.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.061
It was just so... boring.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.594
Then he was at the rave,

24:25.595 --> 24:27.836
where he doesn't even belong.

24:27.837 --> 24:30.168
When I found him passed out,

24:30.169 --> 24:32.771
I saw it as a teaching moment.

24:32.772 --> 24:36.004
Well, what you did,
it killed him, David.

24:36.005 --> 24:38.146
Yeah, right.

24:38.147 --> 24:40.579
No, the position
you left him in,

24:40.580 --> 24:44.212
with his head like that... It
cut off his oxygen supply.

24:44.213 --> 24:46.885
It couldn't have.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.917
I had to move it
when I took my sign.

24:48.918 --> 24:51.089
Then I went home,
uploaded my picture,

24:51.090 --> 24:54.022
and hacked into the
newspaper web site.

24:54.023 --> 24:56.965
You took the sign,
but you left him tied up?

24:56.966 --> 24:59.868
He was starting to move,

24:59.869 --> 25:02.601
and I was worried,
if I untied him,

25:02.602 --> 25:05.905
he'd come after me.

25:12.642 --> 25:14.813
The sign was found
in David Morton's trunk.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.285
So positional asphyxia
is not the cause of death.

25:17.286 --> 25:20.849
That's why I can't find any
petechial hemorrhaging. Jeez.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.851
Now that the blood
has been removed,

25:22.852 --> 25:24.993
subtle injury patterns are
becoming more obvious.

25:24.994 --> 25:27.525
Even in death, the
body keeps changing.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.659
Hopefully something will point
me in the right direction. You know...

25:30.660 --> 25:33.031
(Camera shutter
clicks) I am impressed.

25:33.032 --> 25:37.135
Why? Well, usually you carry a
torch for the victim, but this kid?

25:37.136 --> 25:39.808
The brain of a teenager is

25:39.809 --> 25:41.770
physiologically
different than an adult's.

25:41.771 --> 25:44.643
Reasoning, comprehension,
regulation of emotion...

25:44.644 --> 25:47.646
They're all still developing,
so whatever this kid did,

25:47.647 --> 25:50.118
he was still a work
in progress. Hmm.

25:50.119 --> 25:52.120
This is interesting.
(Camera shutter clicks)

25:52.121 --> 25:54.953
What? Petechiae of
the mucous membrane.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.185
Why in the lips
but not in the eyes?

25:57.186 --> 26:00.158
(Mutters)

26:00.159 --> 26:02.961
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:02.962 --> 26:04.132
Megan. Hmm?

26:04.133 --> 26:06.966
Hey.

26:11.701 --> 26:13.972
Get a picture of that, will you?

26:13.973 --> 26:14.973
Sure.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.075
(Magnifying glass clanks)

26:17.076 --> 26:20.078
(Camera shutter clicks)

26:20.079 --> 26:21.880
Five messages in one morning.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.783
I think, uh, I think
that might be a record.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.116
I'm glad you're getting
back out there, by the way,

26:28.117 --> 26:31.259
and with an FBI agent... that's impressive.
Do not dare try to make this about me.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.623
You are taking my
daughter to California,

26:34.624 --> 26:38.066
and you don't think to mention
it? Look, here, please sit down.

26:38.067 --> 26:39.068
Please.

26:46.936 --> 26:49.237
I didn't go looking
for this, all right?

26:49.238 --> 26:51.880
But as long as you've known me,

26:51.881 --> 26:54.312
you've known that I wanted
to teach. So teach here.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.144
Megan, if we were still married,

26:56.145 --> 26:58.146
and you got a job
offer in... in Dubai,

26:58.147 --> 27:01.149
we'd be packing for Dubai, no questions
asked. I don't know, but I seem to recall

27:01.150 --> 27:04.392
you divorcing me because of that. That's funny,
'cause I seem to remember being made partner

27:04.393 --> 27:07.125
and having to turn it down
because somebody had to

27:07.126 --> 27:10.228
stay home and take care of
Lacey. (Whispers) Oh, god.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.300
(Normal voice) I'm not
forcing this on her, okay?

27:12.301 --> 27:14.833
Uh, she gets to have a say.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.836
Oh, come on. Why do you
think she came to see me?

27:17.837 --> 27:20.809
She doesn't want to leave.
She doesn't want to leaveyou.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.041
And if it means anything,

27:23.042 --> 27:25.143
it's 'cause you've come
a long way with her,

27:25.144 --> 27:27.146
and I respect that.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.421
Then don't do this.

27:34.884 --> 27:36.685
Please.

27:36.686 --> 27:40.859
My career always
came second to yours.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.893
You know, it al-always did.

27:44.894 --> 27:47.296
There's more for me out there.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.069
When are you gonna tell Kate?

27:51.070 --> 27:53.772
When are you gonna
spring this on her?

27:53.773 --> 27:57.105
As soon as I figure
out what we're doing.

27:57.106 --> 27:58.878
(Singsongy) Think again.

28:00.009 --> 28:01.951
Hey. Hey.

28:03.452 --> 28:05.855
Am I interrupting something?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.327
How long have you
known about this?

28:19.328 --> 28:21.930
It just happened.
Well, it's good to know

28:21.931 --> 28:24.933
you haven't been lying to me since the very
beginning. Kate, it's not a sure thing.

28:24.934 --> 28:27.936
But you want it to be. No,
what I want is... (Scoffs)

28:27.937 --> 28:31.439
Oh, my god. Why does everything
have to be so complicated?

28:31.440 --> 28:36.214
No. It's very simple, actually.

28:36.215 --> 28:40.148
You're right.

28:40.149 --> 28:42.821
Hey. (Chuckles)

28:42.822 --> 28:47.095
W-We haven't known
each other that long, but...

28:47.096 --> 28:49.157
Would you come with us?

28:49.158 --> 28:51.129
(Scoffs)

28:51.130 --> 28:53.161
So we know it's not an overdose,

28:53.162 --> 28:55.203
asphyxia, infection,
or aneurysm.

28:55.204 --> 28:57.305
Which means Jake's
symptoms... Blood in the lungs,

28:57.306 --> 29:00.068
petechiae in the
mucous membrane,

29:00.069 --> 29:03.271
and edema... all point
to a cardiac incident.

29:03.272 --> 29:04.813
Maybe.

29:04.814 --> 29:07.946
(Sighs) You're right.
"Maybe" isn't good enough.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.949
I'll keep looking.
You want to fill me in?

29:10.950 --> 29:13.151
I'm going back to the
body. I don't mean that.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.483
I mean Todd in your
office, behind closed doors

29:15.484 --> 29:18.486
and him talking to Kate right now.
Todd wants to move to California.

29:18.487 --> 29:21.489
You're joking. No. He's
going to teach at Berkeley,

29:21.490 --> 29:23.531
and tomorrow, Lacey
and he are leaving

29:23.532 --> 29:26.394
to look for places to live.
How's that for short notice?

29:26.395 --> 29:28.396
Wait. What are you gonna do?

29:28.397 --> 29:31.199
I don't know. Last night
she came to see me,

29:31.200 --> 29:35.073
and I was with Derek. She walked in on us. That's
a lot for her to handle. How's she holding up?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.075
She doesn't know what to do,

29:37.076 --> 29:40.048
and I have no right
to tell her what to do.

29:40.049 --> 29:43.551
I just keep thinking that I'm gonna lose her,
again. You're not gonna lose her, Megan...

29:43.552 --> 29:45.513
No, you do not understand.
I just got her back,

29:45.514 --> 29:47.916
and now she is moving
3,000 miles away.

29:47.917 --> 29:50.218
One minute everything
is fine, the next minute,

29:50.219 --> 29:54.022
it's like somebody just punches
you right in the heart, and...

29:54.023 --> 29:55.394
And what?

29:57.266 --> 29:59.297
You die.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.230
Get Kate.

30:03.132 --> 30:06.905
(Footsteps approaching)

30:06.906 --> 30:09.878
I hope you kicked him
in the you-know-whats.

30:09.879 --> 30:13.181
Hope you're not
talking about me.

30:13.182 --> 30:16.945
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by. Mistake?

30:16.946 --> 30:18.246
No. Not at all.

30:18.247 --> 30:20.818
But you can't, uh,
bring those in here.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.991
It's a contamination risk.

30:22.992 --> 30:25.093
Oh. Sorry.

30:25.094 --> 30:28.196
And, actually, this might
not be the best time.

30:28.197 --> 30:31.099
(Men speaking indistinctly)

30:31.100 --> 30:32.400
Out of curiosity,

30:32.401 --> 30:35.403
uh, when might be
the best time for you?

30:35.404 --> 30:38.036
(Whispers) I don't know.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.968
Hmm. Call me.

30:39.969 --> 30:41.941
(Normal voice) Yep.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.248
So how are you doing?
How areyoudoing?

30:50.249 --> 30:52.321
He wants me to go with them.

30:54.183 --> 30:56.184
What'd you tell him?

30:56.185 --> 30:58.226
That my life is
here, and so is his.

30:58.227 --> 31:01.459
Anyway, what did... What
did you want to show me?

31:01.460 --> 31:05.263
Well, when we thought this
was overdose or asphyxia,

31:05.264 --> 31:07.295
these bruises on his
chest didn't matter.

31:07.296 --> 31:10.338
We figured they were just
from a night of rave dancing,

31:10.339 --> 31:12.640
which they are,
except for this one.

31:12.641 --> 31:15.243
There is a subtle
pattern in the bruise,

31:15.244 --> 31:18.547
and it travels through the
dermis, so... I'm way ahead of you.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.014
Yep.

31:26.015 --> 31:28.016
Hairline fracture
to the sternum,

31:28.017 --> 31:31.519
lower border of the
fourth left costal cartilage.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.992
And I have got
an ovoid contusion

31:33.993 --> 31:36.194
measuring 1.2 centimeters.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.266
Right above the left ventricle.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.128
Commotio cordis.

31:40.129 --> 31:42.600
Jake had theonlyheart attack

31:42.601 --> 31:46.574
that leaves no
evidence of heart attack.

31:46.575 --> 31:48.276
So we're supposed to believe

31:48.277 --> 31:50.278
a perfectly healthy
17-year-old boy's heart

31:50.279 --> 31:53.942
just stopped beating? Well,
his age is exactly the reason.

31:53.943 --> 31:55.944
Most teenagers have an
undeveloped chest plate,

31:55.945 --> 31:59.587
which leaves the heart more
vulnerable to impact. For less than 1%

31:59.588 --> 32:02.290
of the cardiac cycle, the
myocardium is repolarizing,

32:02.291 --> 32:05.293
which means that the
heart is completely at rest.

32:05.294 --> 32:08.256
A strong blow during...

32:08.257 --> 32:11.529
That 10-millisecond
gap... (Beeps)

32:11.530 --> 32:13.361
Can kill you.

32:13.362 --> 32:16.334
So you've narrowed it down to
everybody who was at the rave?

32:16.335 --> 32:18.336
Well, everyone who
was strong enough

32:18.337 --> 32:20.338
to do that kind of damage.

32:20.339 --> 32:24.542
I mean, that takes more than just a
little tap. It's showtime. There we go.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.216
Well, the next
feature is in 3-d. Great.

32:28.217 --> 32:29.547
The killer didn't leave

32:29.548 --> 32:33.381
any evidence on the
surface of Jake's skin,

32:33.382 --> 32:35.383
but we think that he
still left an impression.

32:35.384 --> 32:38.386
(Curtis) So this alternate
light source can show us

32:38.387 --> 32:41.029
bruises beneath bruises
on his subdermal layers.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.391
(Ethan) Lights out.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.134
(Peter) What is it?

32:46.135 --> 32:48.666
It's the Greek letter psi...

32:48.667 --> 32:52.271
From the school's honor society.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.375
There's no anger
like a father's anger.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.310
What happened, Mr. Brady?
You found out Jake defied you

33:02.311 --> 33:04.612
and you went to that
party to track him down?

33:04.613 --> 33:08.486
I'd love to know what you're basing this on.
We found your ring impression on his chest.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.319
We know you hit
him. That's impossible.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.322
After Jake went to
bed, I went back to work.

33:14.323 --> 33:19.327
I was online half the night. I'm online at
the office right now, and yet, here I am.

33:19.328 --> 33:21.599
Do either of you have kids?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.472
No. No. Well...

33:24.473 --> 33:26.674
Not for another seven months.

33:26.675 --> 33:29.737
You have no idea
what you're in for.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.740
All you want is the best for
'em, but you can't protect them.

33:32.741 --> 33:35.713
All you can do is try.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.645
And I failed.

33:37.646 --> 33:40.118
I never laid a hand on my son.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.751
You have to believe me.

33:46.455 --> 33:50.299
Well, we're gonna need
your ring, Mr. Brady.

33:53.702 --> 33:57.806
You can keep it. I
don't need it anymore.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.613
Can I help you?

34:05.614 --> 34:08.776
Call him. Uh, I know Todd.
Calling him's not gonna help.

34:08.777 --> 34:10.748
I'm talking about Derek.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.580
(Sighs)

34:12.581 --> 34:16.124
Do you remember I asked
you once if you had any friends?

34:16.125 --> 34:19.387
Well, this is the first
time that I've seen you

34:19.388 --> 34:22.690
actually light up around
somebody since I've known you.

34:22.691 --> 34:24.833
Don't lose everything, Megan.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.839
Oh.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.702
By the way, you were in the
honor society, weren't you? Yeah.

34:34.703 --> 34:37.405
So was I. You
get the ring? Yeah.

34:37.406 --> 34:39.678
How'd you wear it
before graduation?

34:41.310 --> 34:43.782
Facing me.

34:45.484 --> 34:49.417
Look, uh, about before... you
seriously thought the time to tell me was

34:49.418 --> 34:52.420
in front of a suspect? I'd been
looking for the right way to tell ya.

34:52.421 --> 34:55.793
And that was it? He asked. I
couldn't lie. I answered. Look...

34:55.794 --> 34:59.096
It just came out.
I'm sorry, Sam.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.670
Well, I guess that explains
the bug up your ass.

35:02.671 --> 35:06.434
How's Jeannie? Stunned, like I am.
You know, I just think of what it takes.

35:06.435 --> 35:09.477
I don't know that I'm up for it. Let
me tell you something, bud. (Sighs)

35:09.478 --> 35:11.679
When I was little, my
father was barely around.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.483
I never got the sense that
he gave a crap about me.

35:15.484 --> 35:18.486
Then I got to the seventh
grade, and I got meningitis

35:18.487 --> 35:20.748
and had to spend
half the year in bed.

35:20.749 --> 35:24.121
My father found this gear
none of us knew he had.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.824
If he can do it, so can you.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.357
Not gonna be easy.

35:29.358 --> 35:31.559
No. (Chuckles) It's not.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.701
But I'll have your
back, papa Morris.

35:33.702 --> 35:36.734
You're not really gonna
call me that, are you?

35:36.735 --> 35:39.737
(Indistinct conversations)

35:39.738 --> 35:41.339
Thank you.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.710
Uh...

35:42.711 --> 35:45.773
Well... help yourself.

35:45.774 --> 35:47.775
Hey.

35:47.776 --> 35:51.449
Seriously? Were either
of you in honor society?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.621
Scratch that.

35:53.622 --> 35:56.624
(Chuckles) Before you graduate,
you wear the ring facing towards you,

35:56.625 --> 35:58.626
and then after you graduate,

35:58.627 --> 36:02.260
you turn it around so it faces the
world. Mr. Brady wore his ring like this,

36:02.261 --> 36:04.832
so it means if he hit his son,

36:04.833 --> 36:07.195
the impression he would leave...

36:07.196 --> 36:08.936
Would be like that.

36:08.937 --> 36:11.639
Doesn't match. It's upside down.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.902
Right. Because so was the
ring when she punched him.

36:14.903 --> 36:18.175
Uh, "she"? Most of the members
of the honor society aren't athletes,

36:18.176 --> 36:20.177
which means that none of them

36:20.178 --> 36:22.750
really had the strength to hit
Jake hard enough to kill him.

36:22.751 --> 36:25.814
Except for one member.

36:28.717 --> 36:31.619
They told me to come
by and get my computer.

36:31.620 --> 36:32.920
Is the investigation over?

36:32.921 --> 36:35.663
Yes, I think it is.
Maxine, I'm Dr. Hunt.

36:35.664 --> 36:38.666
Hi. I'm familiar with all
your many accomplishments.

36:38.667 --> 36:41.429
It's... it's quite impressive...

36:41.430 --> 36:43.801
The computer club, uh, editor,

36:43.802 --> 36:47.805
swim team, and most
recently, the honor society?

36:47.806 --> 36:48.906
Mm-hmm.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.838
Congratulations.

36:49.839 --> 36:52.209
Thanks.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.682
Is that the ring? Yes.

36:54.683 --> 36:56.844
May I see it? Oh, yeah.

36:56.845 --> 37:00.548
Oh, nice. (Morris) You also
took a.P. English with Jake Brady.

37:00.549 --> 37:04.522
His father said he had a tutor.
We confirmed that it was you.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.853
That's right.

37:05.854 --> 37:08.926
I couldn't believe he
needed one. Why not?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.699
He always seemed so perfect.

37:11.700 --> 37:15.603
But when he came to
me, he was terrified...

37:15.604 --> 37:17.765
Terrified of failing...

37:17.766 --> 37:19.867
Of failing his father.

37:19.868 --> 37:22.840
Jake was nothing
like he was at school.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.572
We really got along.

37:24.573 --> 37:26.645
Were you romantically involved?

37:28.417 --> 37:31.549
We kissed... On
our last session.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.781
So what I'm wondering is,

37:33.782 --> 37:36.525
why did you tell us
you didn't know him?

37:38.927 --> 37:41.289
(Megan) Maxine...

37:41.290 --> 37:42.960
Look at me.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.032
You're a smart girl.

37:45.033 --> 37:48.437
You know that I'm going to
find Jake's d.N.A. On this ring.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.969
When you saw his picture,

37:51.970 --> 37:55.843
you went down there
to save him, didn't you?

37:55.844 --> 37:59.047
I mean, I couldn't believe
someone would do that to him.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.812
You know, I was a lot
like you in high school.

38:04.813 --> 38:07.955
I studied hard.

38:07.956 --> 38:11.419
I had crushes on
all the popular boys.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.621
(Sighs)

38:13.622 --> 38:15.893
I would've done the same thing.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.995
What happened?

38:17.996 --> 38:21.669
(Techno music playing)
(People speaking indistinctly)

38:21.670 --> 38:23.801
What the hell did you do to me?

38:23.802 --> 38:27.074
Uh, i'm... I'm helping
you, Jake. It's Maxine.

38:27.075 --> 38:29.837
Who? We kissed, remember?

38:29.838 --> 38:32.840
Like I would ever kiss a
girl that lookedlike you?

38:32.841 --> 38:34.812
Get the hell away from me.

38:34.813 --> 38:38.516
♪♪♪

38:38.517 --> 38:39.847
(Thud)

38:39.848 --> 38:41.919
(Grunts)

38:41.920 --> 38:43.921
(Gasps)

38:43.922 --> 38:45.423
Oh.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.854
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

38:46.855 --> 38:49.797
(Crying) He didn't even
remember who I was.

38:49.798 --> 38:52.400
Then after I ran away, I...

38:52.401 --> 38:55.603
I had no idea I had
killed Jake. I swear.

38:55.604 --> 38:58.035
And I never meant for
any of this to happen.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.938
Oh. Oh, god.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.111
I'm... i'm... I'm so sorry.

39:04.112 --> 39:05.813
Um, i'm... It's okay.

39:05.814 --> 39:08.446
I'm so sorry. It's okay.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.679
(Continues crying)

39:11.680 --> 39:13.120
It's gonna be okay.

39:13.121 --> 39:16.124
(Continues crying)

39:20.889 --> 39:22.390
(Ames) She'll be fine.

39:22.391 --> 39:24.832
You know, she's a
minor, there was no intent.

39:24.833 --> 39:27.835
So no little assistant d.A. Is
gonna try and make his bones

39:27.836 --> 39:29.867
putting her in jail.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.640
This is an Amarone,

39:32.641 --> 39:34.642
made from grapes
left to overripen

39:34.643 --> 39:36.404
on the vine until...

39:36.405 --> 39:38.506
They're almost...

39:38.507 --> 39:40.678
Raisins.

39:40.679 --> 39:41.980
(Clink)

39:46.955 --> 39:48.887
(Sighs) Megan?

39:51.059 --> 39:54.992
(Chuckles) Oh,
I'm sorry. I, um...

39:54.993 --> 39:56.664
I...

39:56.665 --> 39:59.667
I tried calling Lacey at
home and on the cell and...

39:59.668 --> 40:01.469
(Sighs)

40:01.470 --> 40:04.472
I don't know what's happening.
Maybe they've already left.

40:04.473 --> 40:05.574
Mm.

40:13.482 --> 40:16.914
(Laughs)

40:16.915 --> 40:20.918
Oh, Derek... (Chuckles)

40:20.919 --> 40:22.119
Yes?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.052
I like you.

40:26.955 --> 40:28.425
But?

40:28.426 --> 40:31.058
But... There's only one person

40:31.059 --> 40:33.030
that I should be
thinking about right now.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.003
And... If Lacey decides to stay,

40:36.004 --> 40:38.636
then...

40:38.637 --> 40:41.539
I need to focus on her.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.812
Hmm.

40:45.173 --> 40:48.446
And if she decides to leave?

40:55.524 --> 40:57.085
(Knock on door)

41:00.959 --> 41:03.862
(Knock)

41:07.696 --> 41:09.697
Have you seen Lacey? What?!

41:09.698 --> 41:12.940
She's not at home... No, I
thought she was with you.

41:12.941 --> 41:15.943
Doesn't answer her cell. We have a plane to
catch. You don't know where your daughter is,

41:15.944 --> 41:19.076
and you're worried about catching a plane? That's
why I'm here, Megan. I'm trying to find her.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.650
You're unbelievable. When was the last time you talked to
her? No, don't do that. Don't. I'm not the bad guy here.

41:22.651 --> 41:24.812
Guys... oh, really?

41:24.813 --> 41:26.584
No, I'm not. (Ames) Guys...

41:26.585 --> 41:29.517
(Megan and Todd)
What?! She's right there.

41:29.518 --> 41:32.259
I've been here a while.

41:32.260 --> 41:33.991
Oh, god.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.063
Lace, what is going on?

41:36.064 --> 41:38.896
What's going on? I
can't believe you guys.

41:38.897 --> 41:42.269
You... you're gonna move across
the country unless I stop you?

41:42.270 --> 41:44.672
So now your whole
career's up Tome?

41:44.673 --> 41:47.104
And you... if I stay,
you're gonna leave

41:47.105 --> 41:49.807
the first guy you've been
with since the divorce.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.939
I'mthe child. You'rethe adults.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.642
You're supposed to be
worried about my happiness.

41:54.643 --> 41:57.014
I'm not supposed to
be responsible for yours.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.117
You're right.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.720
Sorry. I'm sorry, too.

42:02.721 --> 42:05.292
Okay, then.

42:05.293 --> 42:07.725
Okay, then what?

42:07.726 --> 42:11.999
What? Well, I'm not sure
what you meant by "okay, then."

42:12.000 --> 42:15.032
What do you want, babe?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.065
What would makeyouhappy?

42:19.207 --> 42:21.239
What do you think?
