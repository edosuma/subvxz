[people softly chattering]

00:30.237 --> 00:31.065
- Big day.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.274
- I guess so.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.207
- Seriously, you
should be very proud.

00:38.900 --> 00:39.729
- Thanks.

00:41.110 --> 00:43.077
- Time to get
started, everybody.

00:43.112 --> 00:45.217
So who's up first?

[woman sighs]

02:06.402 --> 02:10.130
[pulsing electronic music]

02:14.858 --> 02:16.066
- [Man] Can we get this rolling?

02:16.101 --> 02:17.137
- We're almost there.

02:18.207 --> 02:20.001
- Tell me it'll work.
- It'll work.

02:22.211 --> 02:23.108
- Everything is online.

02:24.868 --> 02:26.146
- Thank you for your patience.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.388
What we're presenting here today

02:27.423 --> 02:29.149
is nothing short
of a breakthrough.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.805
I think you'll be pleased to see

02:30.840 --> 02:33.670
it aligns with your goals at
Syntec Lab, Mr. Montgomery,

02:33.705 --> 02:34.982
and, certainly, it
puts the university

02:35.016 --> 02:37.087
on the cutting-edge of
human sensory research.

02:37.122 --> 02:38.848
All right, ready to go?

02:38.882 --> 02:40.194
Everyone, this is Quinn.

02:40.229 --> 02:42.162
Quinn has been working with
us the past couple months

02:42.196 --> 02:44.888
on a project that we're
calling the Sonic Sleeves.

02:44.923 --> 02:46.511
It's relatively simple.

02:46.545 --> 02:49.169
Based, in part, on the early
work of Paul Bach-y-Rita,

02:49.203 --> 02:51.895
we're using the
mechanoreceptors in the skin

02:51.930 --> 02:55.382
to turn sounds, like my voice,

02:55.416 --> 02:57.315
into pulses that
are felt by Quinn,

02:57.349 --> 02:59.834
who, as you may have
noticed, is deaf.

02:59.869 --> 03:02.492
And these pulses cause
patterns of vibration,

03:02.527 --> 03:07.359
which help Quinn to, in
essence, hear by feeling.

03:09.741 --> 03:10.569
Are you ready?

03:11.915 --> 03:14.780
Hello.
[beeping]

03:14.815 --> 03:17.197
Hello.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.923
Hello.

03:19.958 --> 03:22.202
[soft music]

03:26.723 --> 03:29.243
- That's a little easy.

03:29.278 --> 03:31.314
Most interactions
begin that way.

03:33.143 --> 03:37.803
- Downtown, downtown.
[beeping]

03:42.429 --> 03:45.328
Downtown.

03:54.958 --> 03:56.236
We'll go again.

03:57.754 --> 03:59.791

03:59.825 --> 04:02.207
Cheeseburger.
[beeping]

04:19.466 --> 04:22.331
Happy days.
[beeping]

04:22.365 --> 04:25.886
Happy days.
[beeping]

04:29.303 --> 04:31.443
- Let's go ahead and
stop right there.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.583
Apologies, Ted,
Diana, I was assured

04:33.618 --> 04:35.309
we had some of these
bugs worked out.

04:35.344 --> 04:37.311
- [Ted] Well, let's
hope we do next time.

04:37.346 --> 04:38.968
- If you just give us
a little bit more time.

04:39.002 --> 04:41.453
They were working
perfectly, I assure you.

04:49.496 --> 04:51.083
It's not your fault.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.372
- Was there a reason you started

05:03.406 --> 05:05.684
with a device for the deaf?

05:09.101 --> 05:12.001
Was it personal to you?

05:12.035 --> 05:13.382
- Who are you?

05:13.416 --> 05:15.176
How do you know
what I'm working on?

05:21.182 --> 05:22.494
I'm Dr. Frederick Amberger.

05:23.944 --> 05:26.084
- Should I have heard of you?
- No.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.846
My work has always been
done behind closed doors,

05:29.881 --> 05:33.505
attributed to others or
just plain forgotten.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.026
But I think you can
help change that.

05:37.060 --> 05:37.889
- Your work?

05:39.442 --> 05:43.722
- Seeking out a path to
new sensory experiences,

05:43.757 --> 05:47.105
through our sensory-enlightened
counterparts.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.352
- Sensory-enlightened?

05:52.386 --> 05:54.492
- Where others see disability,

05:54.526 --> 05:56.425
I see transformative individuals

05:56.459 --> 06:01.464
with a great aptitude for
realigning their sensory inputs.

06:02.431 --> 06:03.363
See for yourself.

06:10.956 --> 06:14.374
I believe you can
unlock the sixth sense

06:14.408 --> 06:18.412
by combining the strengths
of five individuals,

06:18.447 --> 06:21.415
each lacking one of the
five fundamental senses.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.452
Sight, hearing, taste,
touch, and smell.

06:25.557 --> 06:28.388
- Combining, how,
that's not possible.

06:29.734 --> 06:33.323
- I thought so, too,
until I witnessed it.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.743
I've witnessed many things that
would be deemed impossible.

06:39.847 --> 06:42.402
- How are you defining
the sixth sense?

06:42.436 --> 06:46.578
- As a new way to
understand, feel, visualize,

06:46.613 --> 06:48.580
and experience the
physical world around us,

06:48.615 --> 06:51.790
illuminating the entire
electromagnetic spectrum

06:51.825 --> 06:55.276
into information
that can be perceived

06:57.175 --> 06:58.590
as easily as me looking
at you right now.

06:58.625 --> 07:02.905
- Look, this sounds
interesting, but I-

07:02.939 --> 07:04.458
- You know as well as I do,

07:04.493 --> 07:07.461
the next frontier of
discovery isn't out there.

07:10.602 --> 07:11.431
It's in here.

07:14.157 --> 07:16.470
Don't let the small
failures define you.

07:20.612 --> 07:24.996
Instead, ask yourself how
far you're willing to go

07:26.376 --> 07:28.206
to find the answers you seek.

07:30.829 --> 07:32.521
I look forward to
hearing from you.

08:19.568 --> 08:23.813
- Seriously, Bob, you can't
wait until after dinner?

08:23.848 --> 08:26.057
- Well, I still have
to get through dinner.

08:26.091 --> 08:26.920
- It's fine, Mom.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.140
- Well, according to the
court order, she should be.

08:47.872 --> 08:51.289
- So, Jules, catch us up.

08:52.462 --> 08:53.533
How's school going?

08:55.465 --> 08:56.294
- It's fine.

08:59.711 --> 09:01.230
- Care to elaborate?

09:01.264 --> 09:02.714
- Good Lord, Jules,
give her something.

09:02.749 --> 09:05.475
She's had the courtesy to
invite you into our home.

09:07.408 --> 09:09.549
- So this isn't my home anymore?

09:09.583 --> 09:10.929
The house I was raised in.

09:13.414 --> 09:15.589
How long do I have to
serve out this penance for?

09:15.624 --> 09:18.143
Three years obviously
isn't enough.

09:18.178 --> 09:20.111
Four, five, the rest of my life?

09:20.145 --> 09:22.596
- You made your bed.
- All right.

09:22.631 --> 09:26.704
If you two aren't going to
bother to try, why should I?

09:26.738 --> 09:28.602
- I had a horrible day, Mom.

09:28.637 --> 09:29.845
Is that what you wanna hear?

09:32.295 --> 09:33.503
- My project failed.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.547
- [Mom] What project?

09:49.174 --> 09:52.315
- It's a sensory
device for the deaf.

09:56.561 --> 09:59.150
It's a wearable technology
that helps you hear

10:00.323 --> 10:01.359
through the vibrations
of the skin.

10:09.022 --> 10:10.610
- No.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.646
- You realize you can't
make her whole again, right?

10:12.681 --> 10:13.716
- Bob!

10:16.685 --> 10:17.617
- I'm not ready, Kath.

10:24.693 --> 10:27.557
- I'm sorry, this was a mistake.

12:02.894 --> 12:03.792
What's the meaning of this?

12:03.826 --> 12:04.793
- So it was personal, then.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.866
- Why do you have something
about my sister in here?

12:08.900 --> 12:09.729
- You like tea?

12:10.902 --> 12:11.731
I'll make tea.

12:23.501 --> 12:25.745
- Why are you cataloging
people's suffering?

12:28.023 --> 12:29.783
- I'm not cataloging suffering.

12:29.818 --> 12:31.889
- These people's lives
are changed forever.

12:31.923 --> 12:33.787
Dana's life has
changed completely.

12:33.822 --> 12:37.446
What shaped her, what drove
her can't be reclaimed.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.275
- Isn't that what you're trying
to do with your contraption?

12:39.310 --> 12:41.657
- It's a path
forward, hopefully.

12:41.691 --> 12:43.935
- What if there's another path?

12:43.970 --> 12:44.798
- [Jules] What, this?

12:46.558 --> 12:50.908
- On second thought, I
think breakfast is in order.

12:53.945 --> 12:57.052
The human body is made
up of layers of cells,

12:58.881 --> 13:03.161
each with receptors
that translate the
energy of a stimulus

13:03.196 --> 13:07.372
into electrical signals ending
in the somatosensory cortex.

13:09.202 --> 13:13.516
Generally, we categorize
these as our five senses.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.832
On their own, these
senses are imperfect.

13:25.356 --> 13:28.842
Imagine what it would be like
if you ate this piece of bread

13:28.877 --> 13:30.948
and it smelled like nothing.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.295
Imagine if you
touched it and it felt

13:33.329 --> 13:36.401
like a gooey, dripping liquid,

13:36.436 --> 13:39.991
devoid of shape and structure.

13:40.026 --> 13:40.854
What do you have?

13:41.751 --> 13:43.305
- A mess.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.755
- No, you'd have our breakfast.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.758
[sizzling]

13:48.793 --> 13:49.829
And when you turn on the heat.

13:53.108 --> 13:54.178
- They all come together.

13:54.212 --> 13:55.869
- Exactly.

13:55.904 --> 13:58.527
- But how, how do
they come together

13:58.561 --> 14:00.391
when we're talking about people?

14:00.425 --> 14:02.151
- Initially, a
controlled environment.

14:02.186 --> 14:04.602
Isolate the sensory enhancements

14:04.636 --> 14:06.535
for each enlightened individual,

14:06.569 --> 14:09.710
identify the pathways of
their sensory realignment.

14:11.126 --> 14:12.955
Then provide a little direction

14:14.474 --> 14:17.063
via some technological
augmentation

14:18.650 --> 14:23.655
to unlock what is already
present within them.

14:24.311 --> 14:25.934
- [Jules] Why the five?

14:25.968 --> 14:28.246
- Well, imagine an electrical
current when it's overloaded.

14:28.281 --> 14:30.939
The five together
help balance the load.

14:32.112 --> 14:34.080
Eventually, we'll
move beyond this need,

14:35.391 --> 14:36.461
but it's where we start.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.946
- But that's impossible.

14:37.980 --> 14:40.258
What you're proposing,
there's no precedent.

14:40.293 --> 14:42.019
- We have to strike
that word "impossible"

14:42.053 --> 14:43.227
from your vocabulary.

14:44.849 --> 14:48.094
The work in that notebook
contains precedent.

14:49.405 --> 14:50.820
We just have to go further.

14:53.099 --> 14:54.376
- But why we?

14:54.410 --> 14:55.549
I don't know what
I bring to this.

14:57.068 --> 15:00.451
- A curious mind, a penchant
for discovery, longevity.

15:04.489 --> 15:06.077
While you may not be
able to articulate it,

15:06.112 --> 15:09.046
you, too, see the
transcendent nature

15:09.080 --> 15:11.772
of our sensory-enlightened
counterparts.

15:12.981 --> 15:16.260
I need someone like you to help
me carry this work forward.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.435
- Who are you, really?

15:21.127 --> 15:26.028
[eerie music]
[whispering]

15:40.456 --> 15:44.219
[shimmering electronic music]

16:29.712 --> 16:30.990
- You want tea?

16:33.578 --> 16:34.786
I'll make tea.

16:37.858 --> 16:39.032
- We already have tea.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.001
[knocking]

16:42.035 --> 16:43.036
- Dad?

16:45.280 --> 16:46.143
How come you're not dressed?

16:46.177 --> 16:47.765
We have an appointment.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.628
Hi?

16:50.112 --> 16:53.012
Dad, it's a little late to
be getting help around here.

16:53.046 --> 16:53.840
We're way past that.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.083
- I'm not help.

16:55.117 --> 16:56.187
- She's a colleague.

16:58.534 --> 17:00.364
- [sighs] Not this again.

17:05.196 --> 17:06.094
College student?

17:06.887 --> 17:07.716
- [Jules] Yeah.

17:08.648 --> 17:10.960
- Well, my apologies.

17:10.995 --> 17:12.100
My father, I'm afraid to say,

17:12.134 --> 17:14.067
is not his best self these days.

17:14.102 --> 17:15.586
And we have an appointment.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.588
- My son has little imagination.

17:18.658 --> 17:20.418
He knows not of what he speaks.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.075
- And it's time for you to go.

17:23.318 --> 17:25.734
[shimmering electronic music]

17:25.768 --> 17:29.772
- You've got roughly
a quadrillion synapses
in your brain,

17:29.807 --> 17:32.603
a quadrillion connections
between nerves,

17:32.637 --> 17:35.640
all happening right now,
carving out the pathways

17:35.675 --> 17:37.194
that make us who we are.

17:37.228 --> 17:39.127
To give you a
little perspective,

17:39.161 --> 17:41.232
the number of stars
in the Milky Way

17:41.267 --> 17:43.200
is about 300 billion.

17:43.234 --> 17:45.236
So you've got 1000
times more synapses

17:45.271 --> 17:48.895
happening inside your
brain than all the stars

17:48.929 --> 17:50.828
in the Milky Way galaxy.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.105
- [Frederick Voiceover] We
have to strike that word

17:52.140 --> 17:53.072
"impossible" from
your vocabulary.

17:54.694 --> 17:57.041
The work in that notebook
contains precedent.

17:58.318 --> 18:00.803
We just have to go further.
- Doing all this computational

18:00.838 --> 18:03.116
work, well, that's
what we're here for.

18:03.151 --> 18:07.189
[shimmering electronic music]

18:20.858 --> 18:22.894
- Day one, October 12th, 1985.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.621
Now what's your name, young man?

18:25.656 --> 18:28.003
- [Young Man] Anthony.
- Anthony.

18:28.037 --> 18:30.109
We've invited several potential

32:19.144 --> 32:23.010
no more of this so-called
doctor of yours,

32:23.044 --> 32:26.116
and no more of this movie
of the week gobbledygook.

32:26.151 --> 32:28.118
You have a directive already.

32:28.153 --> 32:30.672
Stick to it or I'm
banning you from the lab

32:30.707 --> 32:33.054
and turning your project
over to another team.

32:36.506 --> 32:37.990
- What the hell, Jules?

32:38.025 --> 32:38.957
- What?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.337
- You lied to us.

32:40.372 --> 32:43.030
- Now he's threatening
to take our project away.

32:43.064 --> 32:43.962
Why would you do this?

32:44.997 --> 32:48.897
- Because it won't fix her.

32:48.932 --> 32:50.451
- The sleeves?

32:50.485 --> 32:51.900
Of course it won't fix her.

32:53.074 --> 32:54.489
That's not the point.

32:54.524 --> 32:57.113
- [Student] You realize your
sister's still here, right?

32:57.147 --> 32:57.976
- Of course I do.

32:59.253 --> 33:02.359
- Maybe instead of avoiding
her on your quest to fix her,

33:02.394 --> 33:04.741
you could actually try
to be part of her life.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.191
I'm sure she'd
appreciate being seen

33:06.225 --> 33:09.988
as more than a reminder
of your stupid mistake.

33:10.022 --> 33:13.163
[soft electronic music]

33:19.204 --> 33:20.067
- I gotta go.

33:20.101 --> 33:23.553
[soft electronic music]

33:44.643 --> 33:45.471
- No.

33:47.128 --> 33:48.612
No.

33:48.647 --> 33:50.545
I don't wanna see you.

33:52.823 --> 33:53.652
Don't you understand?

33:55.826 --> 34:00.831
I have so little time,
and I have to finish.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.253
- You just need to
get all the pieces.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.982
And then you can come home.

34:14.017 --> 34:17.158
[soft electronic music]

34:49.708 --> 34:52.193
[phone chimes]

34:58.199 --> 34:59.269
- Hello?

35:00.374 --> 35:01.202
Yes, this is she.

35:04.205 --> 35:05.275
Mister who?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.141
Oh.

35:10.729 --> 35:11.902
Oh, yes.

35:14.284 --> 35:15.285
Is everything okay?

35:18.978 --> 35:20.290
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.641
And I know you're
both really mad at me,

35:26.676 --> 35:29.092
and I screwed up,

35:31.301 --> 35:33.510
and that you both
probably think I'm crazy,

35:37.204 --> 35:38.688
but they found Amberger,

35:41.553 --> 35:43.106
and I really want your help.

35:45.212 --> 35:46.074
- Who's they?

35:49.699 --> 35:51.252
- [Cop] You ever make
it over to Idaho?

35:52.357 --> 35:53.220
- Oh, hey.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.637
- Boise PD ran some prints.

35:56.671 --> 35:58.259
- I lost the biggest
fish of my life in Idaho.

35:59.536 --> 36:01.676
Fought that thing
for nearly an hour.

36:01.711 --> 36:03.264
Then it just slipped the line.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.336
Nicknamed him Goliath.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.478
Anyway, what have you got?

36:10.513 --> 36:12.791
- [Cop] Boise PD ran some
prints for an old case.

36:14.241 --> 36:15.690
- Heinrich Kline.
- Yeah.

36:15.725 --> 36:17.727
Apparently, he was developing
some top secret tech

36:17.761 --> 36:19.694
and then decided he
wanted to keep it.

36:23.284 --> 36:25.217
- I can't imagine 30-year-old
technology's worth a damn now.

36:25.252 --> 36:27.875
- Well, Uncle Sam seems to
think it's worth a trip.

36:27.909 --> 36:29.566
- Fishing alone is worth a trip.

36:29.601 --> 36:31.361
Have you alerted Boise PD?

36:31.396 --> 36:32.776
- Yeah.

36:32.811 --> 36:34.122
They're making the
call right now.

36:34.157 --> 36:35.745
- [Cop] Lucky we
found your number
stuffed inside his pocket.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.333
- Well, is he okay now?

36:37.367 --> 36:38.334
- He seems to have his
head screwed on straight,

36:38.368 --> 36:39.921
for now at least.

36:39.956 --> 36:41.129
- Jules.
- Doc!

36:41.164 --> 36:42.061
What happened, are you okay?

36:42.096 --> 36:43.235
- Yeah, I'm much better now.

36:43.270 --> 36:45.755
- This is Officer Sternes.

36:45.789 --> 36:47.205
- We better jump on
this one right away.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.207
- Are we talking about
the fishing or the case?

36:49.241 --> 36:50.242
- Exactly.

36:56.973 --> 36:57.836
- Who's Mr. Kline?

37:05.326 --> 37:07.017
Why have you been lying to us?

37:08.433 --> 37:11.056
- I assure you, everything
I shared with you

37:11.090 --> 37:13.541
is real and possible.

37:13.576 --> 37:15.129
- He's wanted by the FBI.

37:15.163 --> 37:16.993
- He's what?
- He's what?

37:21.308 --> 37:23.068
Why?

37:23.102 --> 37:24.311
- Stealing government property.

37:24.345 --> 37:26.416
- I didn't steal anything.

37:29.592 --> 37:31.283
I simply kept my research.

37:31.318 --> 37:32.422
- We'll keep him here.

37:34.113 --> 37:37.185
FBI, they want us to hold
that Kline character.

37:39.015 --> 37:40.465
- That might be a
bit of a problem.

37:43.122 --> 37:44.779
- I've put a lot
of faith in you.

37:45.780 --> 37:47.023
This means a lot more to me

37:47.057 --> 37:48.818
than I think that
you understand,

37:48.852 --> 37:51.786
so, please, tell us
what is going on.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.346
- Smell with your nose,

37:59.380 --> 38:01.348
touch with your fingers
[speaker drowned out].

38:01.382 --> 38:02.763
- [Amberger Voiceover]
Her name was Hilda.

38:02.797 --> 38:07.354
She was my whole world,
my partner in everything.

38:08.251 --> 38:09.079
- See with your eyes.

38:10.253 --> 38:12.842
- You need Missy
to tell you that?

38:14.361 --> 38:15.327
- [Amberger Voiceover] She's
the one who helped guide

38:15.362 --> 38:17.536
out experiments to
their initial success.

38:17.571 --> 38:21.368
[shimmering electronic music]

38:24.578 --> 38:25.924
It started slowly.

38:27.374 --> 38:29.686
Her muscles would
give out suddenly

38:31.170 --> 38:33.621
or she'd be stricken
with episodes of fatigue.

38:33.656 --> 38:36.383
Before we could get a handle
on what was happening,

38:36.417 --> 38:37.901
it accelerated.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.389
Hilda insisted on
continuing the work.

38:44.011 --> 38:46.496
She was convinced the Five
held the key to her cure.

38:48.671 --> 38:51.294
- Does anybody else see this?

38:53.365 --> 38:54.642
- It's incredible.

38:54.677 --> 38:56.368
- Just as we had our
first breakthrough,

38:56.403 --> 38:58.336
we faced being shut down.

38:58.370 --> 39:01.097
What are they
seeing, experiencing?

39:01.131 --> 39:04.928
[shimmering electronic music]

39:06.930 --> 39:10.417
Our higher-ups wanted
actionable, usable technology.

39:11.556 --> 39:13.523
I tried to buy some time

39:13.558 --> 39:15.525
with another project
we had developed.

39:17.562 --> 39:19.598
We called it the Sonar Suit,

39:19.633 --> 39:22.670
based on bats' use
of echolocation,

39:22.705 --> 39:26.191
sonar data translated
to electronic pulse

39:26.225 --> 39:28.952
to provide a 360 degree
view that subjects

39:28.987 --> 39:31.369
would see all at once.

39:32.542 --> 39:37.305
[shimmering electronic music]
[beeping]

39:48.558 --> 39:50.388
[gun bangs]

39:50.422 --> 39:55.393
[shimmering electronic music]
[beeping]

39:58.775 --> 40:00.950
[gun bangs]

40:00.984 --> 40:04.574
The problem was, initial
tests were so successful,

40:04.609 --> 40:08.475
it caused them to abandon
our other sensory research

40:08.509 --> 40:10.408
to concentrate
solely on the suit.

40:12.755 --> 40:14.998
So, before all of our
work with the Five

40:15.033 --> 40:18.795
was to be filed away
in some cavernous void,

40:18.830 --> 40:23.421
and the Sonar Suit sent
off to war, I liberated it.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.526
One of the original Five, Toby,

40:26.769 --> 40:30.428
had a quiet place,
far from prying eyes,

40:30.462 --> 40:31.946
which he offered
up as a safe haven

40:31.981 --> 40:33.189
to continue the work.

40:34.535 --> 40:39.126
So we left and began
living as the Ambergers.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.025
There, Hilda helped us
reconfigure the Sonar Suit

40:42.060 --> 40:44.511
into a device that
we hoped would mimic

40:44.545 --> 40:46.582
the experience of the Five.

40:46.616 --> 40:50.206
- So Hilda's H in the notebook.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.656
- [Amberger] Yes.

40:51.690 --> 40:52.519
- [Sam] What happened to her?

41:03.426 --> 41:04.496
- I don't like this.

41:04.531 --> 41:05.670
I don't think we're ready.

41:05.704 --> 41:08.017
- We've reversed the
polarity of the sensors.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.364
We've tested all of
our modifications.

41:10.398 --> 41:14.610
- Yeah, but doing this out
here, it's too dangerous.

41:14.644 --> 41:18.061
- You and I both know this
is the only viable option,

41:18.096 --> 41:21.548
free of electrical
interference, radio waves.

41:21.582 --> 41:23.032
- We could've gone into
the middle of a field.

41:23.066 --> 41:25.690
- Sure, but it wouldn't
have been as romantic.

41:27.554 --> 41:28.658
- Fine...

41:29.521 --> 41:30.833
- But, I am pulling the plug...

41:32.041 --> 41:33.594
- if anything looks
like it's going wrong.

41:37.702 --> 41:39.255
Just kiss me.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.671
[quiet music]

41:57.756 --> 41:58.723
Help me get this on.

42:13.634 --> 42:15.256
Here's to discovery.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.607
- Are you sure?

42:20.641 --> 42:21.711
- Never more.

42:29.650 --> 42:30.720
[clicking]

42:30.755 --> 42:33.378
[buzzing]

42:33.412 --> 42:34.724
Tingles.

42:34.759 --> 42:36.968
[buzzing]

42:42.352 --> 42:43.837
- [Amberger] What are you doing?

42:44.838 --> 42:46.356
- It's beautiful.

42:49.739 --> 42:51.120
- Hilda, sit down.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.607
- All those things they saw.

42:55.642 --> 42:56.470
- Sit down!

42:58.645 --> 42:59.611
- The full spectrum.

42:59.646 --> 43:00.681
- Hilda, sit!

43:04.098 --> 43:04.927
Hilda.

43:04.961 --> 43:07.170
[buzzing]

43:10.208 --> 43:11.036
Hilda.

43:12.003 --> 43:13.280
Hilda!

43:13.314 --> 43:14.143
Hilda!

43:16.386 --> 43:17.215
She passed away.

43:20.528 --> 43:21.668
- Is that why you stopped?

43:29.710 --> 43:32.610
- That, and I didn't
have all the pieces.

43:33.990 --> 43:35.371
Hilda was gone.

43:36.786 --> 43:37.891
I had a son to raise.

43:41.688 --> 43:42.620
I had to make a choice.

43:44.242 --> 43:46.624
[quiet music]

43:53.976 --> 43:55.909
- You think someone
will be coming now?

43:58.049 --> 43:59.119
- [Amberger] The
government tends to have

43:59.153 --> 44:00.396
a very long memory.

44:02.812 --> 44:04.365
- How do we finish then?

44:04.400 --> 44:07.817
- Jules, you can't be
suggesting we continue this.

44:08.853 --> 44:09.819
- I want to see it through, Max.

44:09.854 --> 44:11.856
- But the man's a fugitive.

44:20.071 --> 44:21.693
- You two have shown
me time and again

44:21.728 --> 44:23.350
your remarkable resilience,

44:23.384 --> 44:26.560
meeting all the challenges
that life throws at you,

44:26.594 --> 44:29.977
and, Max, you're right,
I need to stop seeing

44:30.012 --> 44:31.599
Dana through the
lens of my own guilt

44:31.634 --> 44:34.741
and start seeing the same
thing I see in both of you,

44:34.775 --> 44:37.191
the thing that Dr. Amberger
has finally given me

44:37.226 --> 44:40.263
the language for,
sensory enlightenment.

44:41.782 --> 44:43.577
We all know there's
something to all this,

44:43.611 --> 44:44.854
something worth exploring.

44:44.889 --> 44:46.753
- Still, Jules, we
don't have subjects,

44:46.787 --> 44:49.410
we don't have a lab, equipment.

44:49.445 --> 44:50.998
The government may be after him.

44:51.033 --> 44:53.069
- What if you two
are the subjects?

44:53.104 --> 44:54.761
That only leaves three more.

44:54.795 --> 44:58.523
- Only two more, if we
return to the quiet place,

44:58.557 --> 45:00.698
and the equipment is there.

45:00.732 --> 45:01.975
- I don't know, Jules.

45:02.872 --> 45:04.771
This is crazy.

45:04.805 --> 45:08.291
[pulsing electronic music]

45:11.778 --> 45:14.263
- Sometimes you
have to ask yourself

45:14.297 --> 45:17.922
how far you're willing to go
to find the answers you seek.

45:19.682 --> 45:21.891
The next frontier
isn't out there,

45:23.306 --> 45:24.135
it's in here.

45:25.343 --> 45:28.829
[pulsing electronic music]

45:33.247 --> 45:36.492
- No matter what, we agree
to finish the sleeves.

45:37.665 --> 45:38.770
- Of course.

45:38.805 --> 45:41.877
Sam, how about it?

45:41.911 --> 45:43.533
Are we all in for discovery?

45:44.362 --> 45:47.848
[pulsing electronic music]

45:51.818 --> 45:55.718
- If the paper gets
authored, we get top billing,

45:57.099 --> 45:58.928
since we're the
enlightened ones.

46:00.619 --> 46:01.448
- Obviously.

46:06.694 --> 46:11.078
- So, the local PD accidentally
released our Mr. Kline.

46:11.113 --> 46:12.355
Apparently, he left
with a young woman

46:12.390 --> 46:13.805
named Jules Christopher.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.600
I guess she's a
university student

46:15.634 --> 46:17.913
working something they
call a sensory lab,

46:17.947 --> 46:20.950
which, based on Kline's
file, is right up his alley.

46:20.985 --> 46:22.262
I'd say that's our first stop.

46:22.296 --> 46:23.125
Hey.

46:24.057 --> 46:25.817
- Oh, great work.

46:25.852 --> 46:27.819
Hey, there's a local
fly shop nearby.

46:27.854 --> 46:29.717
What do we say we hit
that along the way?

46:29.752 --> 46:32.928
This way, if we get stuck
in some cross-country chase,

46:32.962 --> 46:34.170
I have my license.

46:34.205 --> 46:35.862
- I can't tell if
you're joking or not.

46:36.966 --> 46:37.898
- I never joke about fishing.

46:40.901 --> 46:42.489
- If we leave now, we can
be there before nightfall,

46:42.523 --> 46:45.043
and I'm sure we can find some
other subjects on the way.

46:45.078 --> 46:46.424
- Be where by nightfall?

46:52.154 --> 46:53.362
And where have you been?

46:55.364 --> 46:57.228
I thought I warned
you about this one.

46:59.989 --> 47:01.404
You missed our appointment.

47:02.889 --> 47:05.132
I've been all over
town looking for you,

47:05.167 --> 47:07.859
and then I find you in the
company of your colleague,

47:07.894 --> 47:09.343
planning an escape somewhere?

47:12.036 --> 47:13.382
- It's none of your concern.

47:13.416 --> 47:15.349
- Dad, you are my concern.

47:15.384 --> 47:16.868
That's why we're
making this move,

47:16.903 --> 47:18.387
so you can get the
medical attention you need

47:18.421 --> 47:19.940
and be cared for properly.

47:21.597 --> 47:23.875
- I am much too busy
for that nonsense.

47:23.910 --> 47:25.635
- This isn't a negotiation.

47:27.016 --> 47:28.362
Dad, stop!

47:32.919 --> 47:34.610
If only you could
put that big brain

47:34.644 --> 47:36.370
of yours to work
saving yourself.

47:37.544 --> 47:38.890
- What do you think
I'm doing, son?

47:38.925 --> 47:42.411
- Honestly, I have no idea.

47:44.447 --> 47:45.724
I never have with you.

47:46.933 --> 47:50.868
I know I've already
lost one parent

47:50.902 --> 47:52.214
to this obsession of yours.

47:53.663 --> 47:56.045
I know I'm barely
coming to terms

47:56.080 --> 47:59.566
with what we are
facing right now.

47:59.600 --> 48:04.191
- All I'm facing is a
deadline to complete the work.

48:04.226 --> 48:05.158
Excuse the pun.

48:07.919 --> 48:09.472
- How can you joke?

48:09.507 --> 48:13.476
- Because what you see
as a frightening unknown,

48:14.684 --> 48:19.689
I see as an opportunity
for discovery,

48:20.932 --> 48:23.314
my last opportunity.

48:25.764 --> 48:27.111
I miss her, too,

48:30.873 --> 48:35.843
every day, but she, like me,

48:35.878 --> 48:38.501
lived for the discovery.

48:43.886 --> 48:46.509
- So neither one of you took
the time to consider me.

48:46.544 --> 48:48.822
- I was trying to save her!

48:48.856 --> 48:49.685
- Yeah?

48:51.100 --> 48:52.101
How'd that work out?

48:56.726 --> 48:58.936
Thank you for bringing him home.

48:58.970 --> 49:00.006
I have him from here.

49:04.217 --> 49:05.494
- Dr. Amberger.

49:14.986 --> 49:15.987
- Thank you, Jules.

49:18.231 --> 49:23.236
I'm very sorry, but I
think it's probably best

49:25.686 --> 49:29.414
if you go.

49:47.087 --> 49:49.607
- Wow, Nichols, you gotta
get a load of this one.

49:50.780 --> 49:52.092
Look at the size of that brute.

49:55.061 --> 49:56.890
- I was told someone was
looking for the sensory lab.

49:56.924 --> 49:57.856
- Yeah, that's us.

49:59.410 --> 50:01.136
[Jules sighs]

50:01.170 --> 50:02.516
- What gives?
- His son.

50:02.551 --> 50:04.346
Second person to
pull the plug today.

50:05.174 --> 50:06.762
He's putting Doc into a home.

50:11.077 --> 50:12.112
- So what's the plan?

50:15.081 --> 50:16.116
Are we gonna spring
him or something?

50:19.568 --> 50:20.396
What?

50:21.949 --> 50:23.882
I thought we were
all in for discovery.

50:25.091 --> 50:27.576
- No, I've never heard
of a Heinrich Kline.

50:27.610 --> 50:29.198
- Well, we have
reason to believe

50:29.233 --> 50:31.028
he may have been in contact
with one of your students,

50:31.062 --> 50:32.167
a Jules Christopher.

50:32.201 --> 50:34.238
- Of course.
- So you have heard of him.

50:35.756 --> 50:39.070
- Well, no, but...

50:51.393 --> 50:53.153
He may not be
going by that name.

50:57.951 --> 50:59.573
- Welcome to the last
place you're ever going

50:59.608 --> 51:01.092
to call home, most likely.

51:02.231 --> 51:04.647
- Well, I can certainly
smell the death.

51:06.132 --> 51:08.099
- Well, color me lucky
'cause I can't smell a thing.

51:08.134 --> 51:09.894
I think that's what keeps
my sunny disposition

51:09.928 --> 51:11.654
going all day long.

51:11.689 --> 51:13.000
- No sense of smell?

51:13.829 --> 51:15.106
Very interesting.

51:15.141 --> 51:18.937
- Well, let's just say I really
enjoyed [sniffs] the '80s.

51:21.630 --> 51:23.149
But I'm clean and sober now.

51:23.183 --> 51:25.254
Darned if the old sniffer
didn't give up on me, though.

51:25.289 --> 51:26.911
[pulsing electronic music]

51:26.945 --> 51:28.188
- He may have figured
out we were coming.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.261
Or we might not
be the only thing

51:32.296 --> 51:34.160
catching up with him.

51:34.194 --> 51:37.024
- I study something called
sensory enlightenment

51:37.956 --> 51:39.303
in individuals like you.

51:39.337 --> 51:41.443
- I'm gonna have to have you
hold that thought right now

51:41.477 --> 51:46.482
as I introduce you to
your [whistles] new abode.

51:47.311 --> 51:48.691
There's the dresser, closet.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.831
Restroom's through there.

51:50.866 --> 51:53.662
You can add to or
subtract furnishings

51:53.696 --> 51:56.285
and bring in some personal
bling, if you prefer.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.666
Important details.

51:57.700 --> 52:01.290
Breakfast is at 6:30,
lunch 11:00, dinner 4:45.

52:01.325 --> 52:03.327
We've got games, we've got TV,

52:03.361 --> 52:07.124
we've got exercise classes,
field trips to the zoo,

52:07.158 --> 52:08.539
local plays, things like that.

52:09.402 --> 52:10.955
Now I'm on the day shift,

52:10.989 --> 52:13.440
although there's talk of
moving me to the night shift.

52:13.475 --> 52:15.856
That's on account of
the head of scheduling,

52:15.891 --> 52:19.826
Joni, who used to
be my girlfriend,

52:19.860 --> 52:21.379
is now my ex-girlfriend,
and that's on account

52:21.414 --> 52:24.486
of Brenda, who's on
the day shift with me,

52:26.073 --> 52:28.628
and the night shift, if
you know what I mean.

52:28.662 --> 52:30.181
My name is Stevie.

52:30.216 --> 52:33.046
If you need anything from
me, just press that button.

52:33.080 --> 52:33.909
Any questions?

52:33.943 --> 52:35.082
- Peppermint?

52:35.117 --> 52:35.911
- [Stevie] Oh, I
don't mind if I do.

52:35.945 --> 52:36.774
- Any sign of him?

52:41.710 --> 52:42.538
- Nothing yet.

52:46.335 --> 52:47.336
- How's that taste?

52:47.371 --> 52:49.200
- Like peppermint I guess.

52:49.235 --> 52:50.167
- Very interesting.

52:51.375 --> 52:52.203
- It is?

52:53.722 --> 52:55.206
- Oh, there's his son.

52:55.241 --> 52:57.139
- I'll come to
you, where are you?

52:58.209 --> 53:01.592
[pulsing electronic music]

53:04.526 --> 53:06.113
Never mind, I'll
just find your phone.

53:07.460 --> 53:11.533
- Excuse me, son, would
you escort me to my room?

53:11.567 --> 53:12.775
- Sure.
- It's through the lobby

53:12.810 --> 53:13.707
and down the hall.

53:16.952 --> 53:18.333
- All right.

53:18.367 --> 53:19.748
We're all set up.

53:19.782 --> 53:22.199
We meet a specialist
in the morning.

53:22.233 --> 53:24.408
Dinner is in an hour.

53:26.375 --> 53:28.032
What do you wanna do?

53:28.066 --> 53:29.413
You wanna watch some
TV or something?

53:30.828 --> 53:32.381
- You should've
let me go with her.

53:32.416 --> 53:33.796
I had a plan.

53:35.142 --> 53:38.594
[pulsing electronic music]

53:43.634 --> 53:46.292
- Dad, this is the
best place for you now.

53:49.847 --> 53:51.297
- I know what's
happening to me, Noah.

53:51.331 --> 53:53.575
- Okay, okay.

53:53.609 --> 53:55.404
But can you just admit
that you can't battle

53:55.439 --> 53:57.303
this on your own?

53:57.337 --> 53:59.270
There's a team of doctors here,

53:59.305 --> 54:01.030
specialists that can help you.

54:04.793 --> 54:06.346
- I appreciate
what you're saying,

54:08.175 --> 54:10.005
but none of these
people can help me.

54:11.109 --> 54:12.559
Only I can help me.

54:12.594 --> 54:14.320
- You'll love my room.

54:14.354 --> 54:16.322
It's decorated in an homage

54:16.356 --> 54:20.395
to America's greatest
movie star, Burt Reynolds.

54:20.429 --> 54:22.328
What a dreamboat.
- I've gotta go.

54:25.020 --> 54:25.848
Sorry.

54:26.849 --> 54:28.299
- [Nichols] Agent Nichols, FBI.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.853
We need to speak with
a patient of yours.

54:30.888 --> 54:32.199
The name's Amberger.

54:32.234 --> 54:33.891
He should've checked
in earlier today.

54:35.789 --> 54:37.032
- You never understood.

54:41.208 --> 54:43.210
- You never took the
time to explain it.

54:47.318 --> 54:48.802
[phone buzzes]

54:48.837 --> 54:49.700
- Hello?

54:49.734 --> 54:51.253
- The FBI is in the building.

54:52.461 --> 54:53.773
I repeat, they are
in the building.

54:53.807 --> 54:54.636
- Who's there?

54:58.018 --> 54:59.123
- Hi.

54:59.157 --> 55:00.020
- You've gotta be kidding me.

55:00.055 --> 55:01.332
For God's sakes, do none of you

55:01.367 --> 55:03.472
get the seriousness of
what's happening here?

55:03.507 --> 55:04.473
- We have to go.

55:04.508 --> 55:06.337
- We are not going anywhere.

55:06.372 --> 55:08.788
My father is a sick man,
he needs to be here.

55:08.822 --> 55:11.653
- Doc, you don't
happen to be on the run

55:11.687 --> 55:14.311
from Johnny Law or something?

55:14.345 --> 55:15.484
- The FBI is coming.

55:15.519 --> 55:17.452
- Yeah, that,
apparently for you.

55:17.486 --> 55:18.384
- What, why?

55:19.350 --> 55:20.524
- You think this place is bad,

55:20.558 --> 55:21.559
you don't wanna
try federal prison.

55:21.594 --> 55:23.389
It's a real downer.

55:23.423 --> 55:24.390
- [Noah] Dad, what is this?

55:24.424 --> 55:25.391
- [Amberger] The past
catching up, son.

55:26.392 --> 55:27.841
- What did you do?

55:27.876 --> 55:29.878
- They wanted to
lock everything away,

55:29.912 --> 55:31.742
and I was trying to
save your mother.

55:33.709 --> 55:36.402
You're right, I never
explained it properly or fully,

55:36.436 --> 55:38.093
and I'm sorry for that.

55:38.127 --> 55:39.405
- I think this is a
conversation to have on the way.

55:39.439 --> 55:40.337
- The way?

55:40.371 --> 55:41.648
- [Jules] Out of here.

55:41.683 --> 55:43.478
- Are you sure they're
coming for my father?

55:43.512 --> 55:44.341
- Absolutely.

55:47.723 --> 55:48.828
- Thank you.

55:48.862 --> 55:50.726
[pulsing electronic music]

55:50.761 --> 55:52.245
- [Max] Let's go.

55:52.279 --> 55:54.385
- [Stevie] Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:54.420 --> 55:55.352
Did you guys plan this?

55:55.386 --> 55:56.353
- What is happening, Dad?

55:56.387 --> 55:58.355
- The work is happening.

55:58.389 --> 55:59.390
Are you coming?

55:59.425 --> 56:00.736
- Me?
- Me?

56:00.771 --> 56:02.013
- Both of you.

56:02.048 --> 56:03.912
- If I come with
you and finish this,

56:03.946 --> 56:06.846
whatever it is, will you
come back here with me

56:06.880 --> 56:08.917
and face what you've done,

56:08.951 --> 56:11.540
face what is happening with you?

56:11.575 --> 56:14.060
- Whatever you want, son.

56:14.094 --> 56:15.406
- All right.

56:15.441 --> 56:16.442
- [Nichols] Where
else would residents

56:16.476 --> 56:17.719
normally be right now?

56:17.753 --> 56:19.376
- Well, dinner's not
for another 45 minutes,

56:19.410 --> 56:20.549
and it's free time right now,

56:20.584 --> 56:22.586
so anywhere, I guess.

56:24.588 --> 56:26.417
- We could really use that
nose of yours, Stevie.

56:26.452 --> 56:29.144
- What nose?
- Exactly.

56:29.178 --> 56:32.665
[pulsing electronic music]

56:35.771 --> 56:37.394
- Joni sure can hold a grudge.

56:38.429 --> 56:39.534
What the hell!

56:39.568 --> 56:43.020
[pulsing electronic music]

56:46.782 --> 56:49.406
Woo, yeah, turn on the
Dead, fire up a blunt,

56:49.440 --> 56:51.097
it'll be just like
the summer of '83.

56:51.131 --> 56:51.960
- Let's go.

56:52.788 --> 56:54.445
- Just one little stop.

56:54.480 --> 56:57.966
[pulsing electronic music]

57:06.353 --> 57:07.216
- I got the plate.

57:08.494 --> 57:09.356
- Great.

57:10.634 --> 57:13.119
Maybe this is a good
opportunity for us to regroup-

57:13.153 --> 57:15.086
- John, if you say the
word "fishing" right now,

57:15.121 --> 57:15.915
I am going to shoot you!

57:15.949 --> 57:16.743
- Fishing.

57:16.778 --> 57:17.606
- Hello?

57:18.987 --> 57:19.953
Anybody home?

57:46.566 --> 57:48.499
- What are you doing?

57:51.502 --> 57:52.848
- You're feeling the music?

57:54.056 --> 57:55.989
Well, that's what
my project does.

57:56.024 --> 57:57.957
Well, is supposed to do.

57:57.991 --> 57:59.752
It's supposed to
help you feel sound.

58:01.512 --> 58:02.340
- Yeah.

58:06.552 --> 58:08.554
[Jules sighs]

58:08.588 --> 58:11.660
I'm sorry, I know that
I've been distant,

58:11.695 --> 58:14.594
and I feel like I've made
an awful situation worse.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.856
- Well, of course,
if we get it to work.

58:37.548 --> 58:42.519
Actually, I think that
you just solved it.

58:44.693 --> 58:48.145
- Would you be wiling to
help me with something?

58:49.042 --> 58:50.527
- Are you up for a road trip?

58:52.080 --> 58:53.702
- We got him.
- Yeah?

58:53.737 --> 58:56.567
- Well, we know where
they're going anyways.

58:56.602 --> 58:58.742
We think they're headed
to a town called McCall.

59:09.269 --> 59:10.477
- All right, when
do we head out?

59:10.512 --> 59:12.134
- I sent out an APB
with the local sheriff.

59:12.169 --> 59:13.722
We'll head out tomorrow.

59:13.757 --> 59:15.655
- Well, in that case, you
need a drinking buddy?

59:16.656 --> 59:17.726
- I drink alone.

59:56.213 --> 59:58.905
Gotta say, never thought
you'd set foot in here again.

59:58.940 --> 1:00:00.113
You dying or something?

1:00:02.668 --> 1:00:04.635
Seems a little young for you.

1:00:04.670 --> 1:00:07.086
- Jules, and how?

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:08.743

around you when you walk,

1:00:08.777 --> 1:00:11.366
and you don't smell
old like this one.

Jules, meet Toby, one
of the original Five.

1:00:18.856 --> 1:00:20.409

we finished the work.

1:00:26.036 --> 1:00:27.796
Is it all still here?

Not sure if it's of
much use anymore.

1:00:30.972 --> 1:00:33.146
Didn't go so well last time.

1:00:33.181 --> 1:00:34.700
- We didn't have
all the pieces then.

1:00:34.734 --> 1:00:36.563
- So that's what you've got
waiting in that old bus.

1:00:36.598 --> 1:00:38.358
- Seriously, how are you-

1:00:38.393 --> 1:00:40.119
- I'm assuming that you
discussed the notion

1:00:40.153 --> 1:00:41.879
of sensory enlightenment,
being that you

1:00:41.914 --> 1:00:43.640
just trekked all
the way out here.

1:00:43.674 --> 1:00:45.745
- It's just so amazing.

get good at anything,

something out of your life,

1:01:43.630 --> 1:01:47.565
you think it's
gone, that's done,

1:01:50.776 --> 1:01:52.743
but then you see it again,

1:01:54.296 --> 1:01:57.817
and then you realize
it was always there

1:01:59.508 --> 1:02:00.820
just under the surface,

1:02:07.344 --> 1:02:08.172

1:02:46.141 --> 1:02:48.799
There's a breaker
box in the corner.

1:02:51.698 --> 1:02:52.976
All right, try now.

- It'll take a while.

1:03:10.890 --> 1:03:11.960
We'll have to go through
every piece of machinery.

1:03:34.431 --> 1:03:35.812
of one of the five

We believe that you're what's
called sensory enlightened,

1:03:39.712 --> 1:03:41.990
and we want to explore
that enlightenment

1:03:42.025 --> 1:03:44.061
and how we might focus it,

unlocking what we'll

simply refer to as the
sixth sense, for now.

is some sort of club thing?

1:03:53.553 --> 1:03:54.969
Right?

I mean, sorry, I'm new.

along on this one.

Maybe you can explain

1:04:06.877 --> 1:04:08.914

This is my sister Dana.

And, Dana, you can't hear.

1:04:23.963 --> 1:04:25.447
- But you can see.

1:04:25.482 --> 1:04:26.655
What are you seeing now?

1:04:31.419 --> 1:04:32.696
- So you see me talking,

1:04:32.730 --> 1:04:33.731
and you understand
what I'm saying.

1:04:38.046 --> 1:04:39.254

me, can you point

1:04:39.289 --> 1:04:41.084

1:04:44.984 --> 1:04:46.054
Look.

1:04:49.471 --> 1:04:52.405
- That you're experiencing a
level of sensory enlightenment,

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:54.373
the opportunity to
experience more of the world

1:04:54.407 --> 1:04:56.651
that exists around
us beyond what is

1:04:56.685 --> 1:04:58.066
limited by our biology.

1:04:58.101 --> 1:04:59.102
And, just today,
I witnessed Toby

1:04:59.136 --> 1:05:00.897
catch and filet a fish
without skipping a beat.

1:05:00.931 --> 1:05:02.450
- Practice makes perfect.

- Yeah, but you can
hear, what is it,

1:05:06.109 --> 1:05:07.731
- Like a bat.

1:05:07.765 --> 1:05:09.491
- And our Max here
has had ageusia

1:05:09.526 --> 1:05:11.493
for as long as he can remember.

1:05:11.528 --> 1:05:12.770
- Not as fun as it sounds.

1:05:12.805 --> 1:05:14.738
- But that has
led to hyperosmia.

1:05:14.772 --> 1:05:16.740

from across the dining
room recently, once.

Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

1:05:21.469 --> 1:05:23.747
- Max, it was remarkable.

1:05:23.781 --> 1:05:25.749
And, Stevie, you lost
your ability to smell,

1:05:25.783 --> 1:05:27.440
but you can still taste,

1:05:27.475 --> 1:05:29.063
and since the nose
is responsible

1:05:29.097 --> 1:05:30.167
for part of the flavor of food,

1:05:30.202 --> 1:05:32.480
it's remarkable that you
still have the receptors

1:05:32.514 --> 1:05:34.965
for sweet and sour,
salty and bitter.

They can sense

not being detected

Alone, these senses
are remarkable.

what I'm doing here even.

No idea what that girl
was going on about.

leave, you know.

thought this through.

You were there.

Had neither car, money, ID.

1:07:24.212 --> 1:07:25.041
I am curious.

What if something, something
truly amazing was gonna happen,

and I missed it?

is going to happen.

- That your mother died here.

here, Freddy?

You can't bring her back,

You can hold it, shake
it, smell it, whatever.

The only rule is you
cannot look inside the box.

Once everyone has a
go, we'll open it,
