WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:02.935
What's up, Stan?

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Wanna go to the mall

00:04.438 --> 00:05.838
and accidentally bump kids
into the fountain?

00:05.840 --> 00:07.306
Not a chance.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.441
I got the day off
and nothin' to worry about.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.643
Gonna spend it relaxing
right here.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.979
Nothing to worry about?
In<i> this</i> house?

00:13.981 --> 00:16.648
I give it five minutes before
one of us ruins it for you.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.684
The only question is,
who will it be?

00:18.686 --> 00:19.985
Hey, Dad!

00:19.987 --> 00:21.687
Oh, it's gonna be Steve!

00:21.689 --> 00:23.555
I made a new friend
on the edge of town.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.824
He won't tell me his name!

00:25.826 --> 00:27.726
No, that's
an inappropriate friend!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.495
And then
there's Hayley and Jeff.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.830
Dad,
I need a pregnancy test,

00:31.832 --> 00:34.500
and Jeff and I are too high
to drive to the drug store.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.736
Getting high helps me
prolong our lovemaking.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.141
How's your worry-free day
goin', Stan?

00:42.143 --> 00:43.842
Look, we all know
what the results

00:43.844 --> 00:45.577
of the pregnancy test
is going to be.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.179
Jeff smokes so much weed --

00:47.181 --> 00:50.082
ALL:
How much weed does he smoke?

00:50.084 --> 00:53.385
That -- That there's no way
he could get a girl pregnant?

00:53.387 --> 00:56.555
I mean, it's --
It's not really a joke.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.424
But -- But I could
think of one!

00:58.426 --> 00:59.725
Oh, you lost them, Stan.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.160
Look, if it's not this,

01:01.162 --> 01:02.828
your family will hit you
with something else.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.330
I mean, you haven't even heard
what I'm up to this week.

01:05.332 --> 01:07.166
I'm trying to get
our house included

01:07.168 --> 01:09.168
on a list of potential
World Cup sites.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.569
Oh, no.
That -- That's, like,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.404
the biggest sporting event
in the world.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.506
Picture it --
in our backyard,

01:14.508 --> 01:17.209
120,000
horny soccer hooligans,

01:17.211 --> 01:18.944
each of them hornier
than the last.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.213
I know it sounds crazy,
but FIFA's narrowed it down

01:21.215 --> 01:23.749
to either Soldier Field
or where our pool is now.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.451
(groans)
(machine beeps)

01:25.453 --> 01:27.619
Look, Stan,
you can't even see

01:27.621 --> 01:29.721
the pack of light bulbs
I'm stealing.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.723
We can afford those!
(machine beeps)

01:31.725 --> 01:33.892
That's what I'm trying
to tell ya, Stan.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.260
You can't relax around us.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.130
Mr. S.,
I got us dancing Coke cans.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.565
Did you get
the pregnancy test?

01:39.567 --> 01:40.933
You're silly, Mr. S.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.235
I'm a boy.
I can't get pregnant!

01:43.237 --> 01:46.605
(machine beeping rapidly)
(whispers)
There's no escaping us.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.774
Dad, can my friend
have dinner with us?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.142
I won't be any bother.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.044
I'll just eat
from your boy's plate.

01:52.046 --> 01:54.046
(beeps rapidly,
continuous tone sounds)

01:54.048 --> 01:55.948
Wait. What?!
What does this mean?

01:55.950 --> 02:00.319
It means
you are going to<i> die...</i>

02:00.321 --> 02:02.154
unless you lower
your blood pressure.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.324
Oh, God! How do I do that?
There's only one way.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.393
You have to reduce
your stress or...

02:08.395 --> 02:10.796
<i> you'll perish.</i>

02:10.798 --> 02:17.169
(laughing evilly)

02:18.739 --> 02:20.172
Oh, paper towels.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.441
I should probably get a roll
for the World Cup.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.510
You know, for messes.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.012
(patriotic music plays)

02:27.014 --> 02:30.282
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:30.284 --> 02:33.685
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:33.687 --> 02:37.022
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:37.024 --> 02:41.093
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:42.963 --> 02:46.298
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:46.300 --> 02:48.600
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:48.602 --> 02:49.902
Aah!

02:51.138 --> 02:54.540
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

02:57.044 --> 03:00.512
All right, everyone,
as the great Humpty once rapped,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.848
"Stop what you're doin'
'cause I'm about to ruin..."

03:02.850 --> 03:05.017
whatever it was
that you<i> were</i> doing.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.319
Computer, engage.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.521
(switch clicks, screens whirs)

03:09.523 --> 03:11.323
(beep)

03:11.325 --> 03:14.326
Last night, the C.I.A. mainframe
was hit by a cyber terrorist.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.895
They acquired a lot
of valuable information.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.331
And if you know anyone
undercover in Bolivia,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.699
you don't anymore.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.467
Now all evidence suggests

03:22.469 --> 03:27.172
this attack was carried out
by cyber terrorist Max Zegarra.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.542
And we know<i> exactly</i> where
he's hiding.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.877
So the boring stuff's done.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.312
You need someone to do
the fun part?

03:33.314 --> 03:34.546
Grab him and bag him?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.014
That's one way to go,

03:36.016 --> 03:38.550
but last night I was watching
"Point Break" on TBS

03:38.552 --> 03:40.986
when I realized,
what if this attack

03:40.988 --> 03:43.822
was pulled off by
a pack of renegade surfers

03:43.824 --> 03:46.091
trying to fund
an endless summer?!

03:46.093 --> 03:48.594
Sir, that's crazy!
Jackson gets it!

03:48.596 --> 03:50.862
Now, all I need is
someone to infiltrate

03:50.864 --> 03:52.331
the local surf community

03:52.333 --> 03:54.733
and bring the law breakers
to justice.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.035
Is surfing that sport
that happens at the beach,

03:57.037 --> 03:58.604
the most relaxed place
on Earth,

03:58.606 --> 04:00.372
nowhere near
your stressful family?

04:00.374 --> 04:03.508
Oh, ho! Look who knows
everything about surfing!

04:03.510 --> 04:06.411
Smith, my friend,
the assignment is yours.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.116
STAN: Perfect.
Now I just have to blend in.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.755
Out of the way,<i> haole!</i>
You're on my line.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.925
(chain saw whirring)

04:19.927 --> 04:22.127
Aah! Aah!

04:22.129 --> 04:23.595
(grunts)

04:26.967 --> 04:29.968
What's up,<i> haole?</i>
This beach is for locals only.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.570
What's your zip code,
bitch?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.939
And don't...lie.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.507
KAI:
Hey, leave him alone!

04:38.912 --> 04:41.280
Back off.
The beach is for everyone.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.648
Says who?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.750
The city bylaws.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.119
Yeah? Well,
I'm gonna go down to City Hall

04:47.121 --> 04:49.755
and talk to the head
of the records department.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.458
And<i> then</i> we'll see about
your little "theory."

04:53.460 --> 04:56.628
You're lucky,<i> haole.</i>
This isn't over.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.300
Whoa! Thanks!
Yeah, no problem, man.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.403
Don't worry about those guys.
They just don't like outsiders.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.338
How could they tell
I'm not local?

05:06.340 --> 05:09.308
Well, trying to surf a rowboat's
a pretty big red flag.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.276
You don't really have
a beach vibe.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.744
A beach vibe.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.946
It's so simple.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.848
Do I have it now?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.250
All right, tell you what --

05:18.252 --> 05:20.152
come back tomorrow,
and I'll show you.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.620
By the way, I'm Kai.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.855
I was named after
one of the Hawaiian Islands.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.424
Which one?
Maui.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.492
The best one. Nice!

05:27.494 --> 05:30.495
Not sure how you get "Kai"
out of that, but nice.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.600
(doorbell rings)

05:35.602 --> 05:37.336
(Italian accent)
<i> Buongiorno.</i>

05:37.338 --> 05:39.705
I am from FIFA's World Cup
site selection committee.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.606
Ugh. Roger!

05:41.608 --> 05:43.208
But I must make a mistake.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.711
This is no stadium.
This is a house.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.113
Actually,
it's more of a home...

05:48.115 --> 05:50.716
<i> Home</i> of
the future World Cup.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.117
(chuckles)

05:52.119 --> 05:53.719
Clever.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.788
But being clever is only 60%
of the selection process.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.690
Let's talk
security infrastructure.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.126
Oh, yes, of course.
Business before pleasure.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.128
But before that, pleasure.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.030
Ants on a log?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.865
The ant.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.801
(crunches) The ant...

06:09.803 --> 06:11.470
is amazing.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.305
Oh, thank God.
But...

06:13.307 --> 06:14.906
I have not tried the log.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.008
(gasps)
(crunches)

06:17.010 --> 06:19.311
All right, that's it.
I'm out.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.647
The log --

06:22.649 --> 06:24.383
she is incredible.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.753
I'm telling you, a-a Ferrari
is faster than a cop car.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.489
Steve, a cop car can catch
a Ferrari. Trust me.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.357
Dad, can you believe
this guy?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.760
Ugh.
This is<i> still</i> happening?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.195
I-I gotta --
I-I gotta go to the beach.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.698
<i> (The Hollywood Tornadoes'</i>
<i> "Bustin' Surfboards" playing)</i>

06:39.700 --> 06:42.200
You know why
I love surfing, Stan?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.703
It's all about learning
to let go.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.106
You know, I fathered six kids
in three different countries,

06:48.108 --> 06:50.409
and I just let 'em
all go.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.777
I can't let go.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.545
I have to be responsible
for my family.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.747
If I let go,
all hell would break loose.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.116
Stan, make me a promise.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.452
The right wave is gonna come,
dude.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.889
And when it does, you're gonna
let go of your worries.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.558
Just go with the flow.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.059
Whenever.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.963
This one! P-Paddle!
Paddle, Stan! Now, now, now!

07:17.604 --> 07:22.374
<i> Stan, hamburger buns were</i>
<i> on sale, so I stole 600.</i>

07:22.376 --> 07:25.710
<i> When I have a baby,</i>
<i>I'm gonna name it, "Recycling."</i>

07:25.712 --> 07:27.813
<i> Dad,</i>
<i> me and my mysterious friend</i>

07:27.815 --> 07:29.381
<i> are blood brothers now!</i>

07:29.383 --> 07:31.483
<i> Stan, FIFA says</i>
<i> the downstairs bathroom's</i>

07:31.485 --> 07:33.118
<i> gonna need 70 urinals.</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:34.920
<i> It'll work if we move</i>
<i> the hamper.</i>

07:34.922 --> 07:38.356
KAI: Remember, Stan!
Let go!

07:42.729 --> 07:44.663
I'm doing it!

07:48.402 --> 07:50.101
Ahh.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.837
Looks like
you're startin' to get it.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.473
I feel so...relaxed.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.508
Whoa, is that a soul patch?

07:56.510 --> 07:59.277
Huh. It must've grown in
during my ride.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.814
Stan, it looks really good.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.121
I didn't know we got a hammock.
When did we get a hammock?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.424
Oh, sorry.
Didn't see you on the phone.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.994
All good, Klaus. I'm just
listening to the surf report.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.763
4-foot swells
and glassy as hell.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.500
Sounds like glassy is
where it's at, bro.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.868
Tap it.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.505
Ooh, I like Surfer Stan.
He's the chillest.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.140
Dad, my new friend needs to
stop by his ex-wife's house

08:29.142 --> 08:31.676
to pick up some stuff,
and he asked me to be lookout.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.778
Can we take your car?
He's not allowed to drive

08:33.780 --> 08:35.614
'cause the state's
a bunch of assholes.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.883
Yeah, do your thing.
That worked?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.485
Go, Steve.
Don't question it. Just go.

08:40.487 --> 08:41.820
Oh, hey, Stan, good news.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.288
We've been approved
for a liquor license

08:43.290 --> 08:44.623
for the World Cup.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.192
We can sell beer,
wine, and soju.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.127
We can make soju cocktails.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.196
They taste like normal cocktails
except they suck

08:51.198 --> 08:52.697
and they taste like
nail polish.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.499
Sounds dank, bro.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.867
Relax, Stan.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.369
Wait.
What's wrong with you?

08:57.371 --> 08:59.704
I got a quarter million-person
liquor license

08:59.706 --> 09:02.641
for the<i> stadium</i>
I'm building in your backyard.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.643
There are gonna be
Costa Ricans on your property.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.977
That doesn't worry you?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.646
Guess you didn't get
the memo.

09:07.648 --> 09:11.349
I'm a surfer now,
and I don't<i> have</i> worries.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.953
Sorry, I had your copy
of the memo.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.059
(chuckles) I thought I might
see you back out here.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.661
Looks like you got the bug.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.729
Is that why my stool
is crazy loose?

09:24.731 --> 09:27.933
No, Stan. I think it's that
starfish we all saw you eat.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.068
I'm talking about
the surf bug, bro,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.203
where all you think about
is surfin'.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.606
Is that all you think about?
Surfin' waves?

09:34.608 --> 09:38.410
Truth is, there's only one wave
I think about surfing anymore.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.379
You know how waves, like,
go from the ocean to the shore?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.747
Okay!

09:42.749 --> 09:44.849
Well, legend has it,
every decade,

09:44.851 --> 09:47.586
there's a freak weather system
over the Atlantic

09:47.588 --> 09:49.187
that reverses the jet stream,

09:49.189 --> 09:50.855
and on one beach in Florida,

09:50.857 --> 09:53.592
you can catch a wave
that starts on the beach

09:53.594 --> 09:57.562
and ride it all the way
to the center of the Atlantic.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.931
Stranded in the middle
of the Atlantic?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.367
Your worries will never
find you there.

10:02.369 --> 10:07.305
Anyway, how about right now,
we ride this wave together?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.307
Sounds good. After you.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.076
No, Stan.<i> Together.</i>

10:11.078 --> 10:13.578
Got it. Me first.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.648
<i> (surf rock music playing)</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:30.595
Whoo-hoo!
(cheering)

10:30.597 --> 10:33.798
Stan, meet the crew --
Gorney, Sam, and Taylor.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.266
That was amazing!

10:35.268 --> 10:37.102
Dude, you're a natural!

10:37.104 --> 10:38.436
Kai, big news, man.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.238
There's a typhoon
in the Atlantic

10:40.240 --> 10:42.140
that's reversing
the jet stream.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.643
This is it, Stan!
The wave that goes out!

10:44.645 --> 10:47.012
Are you kidding me?
We were<i> just</i> talking about that.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.347
We're going to Florida,
and you're coming with us.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.782
(cellphone rings)

10:50.784 --> 10:52.917
(beep)
<i> Mahalo,</i> Deputy D.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.352
Stow that surf shit, Smith!

10:54.354 --> 10:56.488
We caught the hacker,
so I'm bringing you in.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.289
You're back at your desk
tomorrow.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.624
STAN: What?!

10:59.626 --> 11:01.526
Turns out "Point Break"
wasn't the clue.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.862
It was just the movie that
was on when I was super high.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.830
But now that I'm
medium high,

11:05.832 --> 11:09.768
I realize it was ridiculous
to suspect those surfers at all.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.636
Okay, they may not be hackers...
(laughter)

11:11.638 --> 11:13.438
But I have a hunch
they're up to something.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
It -- It's way too soon
to take me off the case.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.043
A hunch isn't good enough.
I need evidence!

11:18.045 --> 11:20.545
No worries, brah.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.913
(beeps)

11:26.787 --> 11:28.119
(gunshot)
(customers scream)

11:28.121 --> 11:29.487
My name is Kai.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.356
This is Gorney, Taylor,
and Sam.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.192
We are surfers,
and this is a bank robbery.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.694
(high-pitched voice)
You tell 'em, Kai!

11:35.696 --> 11:37.395
(low-pitched voice)
We're doing this to fund

11:37.397 --> 11:39.497
our surf adventures.
(thud)

11:39.499 --> 11:41.700
(wood creaks)

11:41.702 --> 11:43.168
(wood rattling)

11:43.170 --> 11:45.837
(normal voice)
And we laugh at the C.I.A.!

11:45.839 --> 11:47.172
Ha ha ha ha!

11:47.174 --> 11:48.740
Ha ha ha --

11:48.742 --> 11:50.875
And they're laughing at us.
That's what really gets me.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.877
Are we sure they're not
laughing<i> with</i> us?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.813
This is why I need
to stay on the beach.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.881
It might take a lifetime
of undercover work

11:56.883 --> 11:58.249
to bring them all
to justice.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.218
They just robbed a bank
on video!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.387
We've got all we need.
Bring them in.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.523
But th-this case goes deeper.
This is just the tip.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.392
The tip is my favorite part,
Smith.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.927
The tip's all I need.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.695
Any more than that,
and it's too much!

12:10.697 --> 12:12.497
Well, I-I-I wanna bring them in
as much as anyone.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.333
But can't it be after I surf
a little bit more?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.103
We're gonna go to Florida
and surf the wave that goes out!

12:18.105 --> 12:19.537
It's called Firestone Beach,

12:19.539 --> 12:21.372
but the locals call it
Shady Cove.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.274
And I wanna go there
and surf with them!

12:23.276 --> 12:25.110
They're my best friends!
Best friends?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.178
One --
that hurts my feelings.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.848
Two -- the fact that they<i> are</i>
your best friends

12:29.850 --> 12:31.549
makes me hate them even more!

12:31.551 --> 12:33.351
Bring them in immediately!

12:33.353 --> 12:34.919
But, Sir --
Just go!

12:34.921 --> 12:37.589
(voice breaks)
I don't want you to see me cry.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.291
Drive, drive, drive!
(tires peal)

12:40.293 --> 12:44.429
(gasps) Those low-key surfers
have kidnapped my best friend.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.598
But where?
Where are they taking him?!

12:46.600 --> 12:49.067
He said something about
a beach. What was it?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.569
Damn it, Avery.
He's your best friend!

12:51.571 --> 12:53.371
You should've been listening!

12:53.373 --> 12:56.407
This is why he's looking for
other best friends!

12:56.409 --> 12:58.209
(surf rock music playing)

12:58.211 --> 12:59.544
Yes!

12:59.546 --> 13:01.780
The music's a clue.
Follow it.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.849
¶¶

13:11.625 --> 13:14.359
<i> (surf rock music playing)</i>

13:18.632 --> 13:20.965
Hanging with you guys
is the best.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.401
And this horchata stuff
is on point.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.069
I gotta tell you, Kai,

13:25.071 --> 13:27.138
there is literally nothing
that can ruin this for me.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.840
(buzzing)

13:28.842 --> 13:31.810
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.144
(buzzing)

13:33.146 --> 13:34.512
Look at that,

13:34.514 --> 13:36.948
I didn't worry,
and the bee flew away

13:36.950 --> 13:40.151
right across the street
and onto Dick's jacket.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.121

13:43.123 --> 13:44.656

13:44.658 --> 13:46.124
(gasps) Dick! The C.I.A.!
Everyone in the van!

13:46.126 --> 13:47.759
We can't just get in the van.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.594
We gotta finish
chillin' first.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.963
Well,
chill as fast as you can!
(slurping loudly)

continue)

14:02.375 --> 14:04.509

All right, good chill.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.977

(beep)

14:09.716 --> 14:10.982
(beep)

14:10.984 --> 14:12.383
Hey, Stan,
you need to get home.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.385
I went with
an iffy scaffolding company,

14:14.387 --> 14:16.054
and there is, uh...

14:16.056 --> 14:18.389
there's a lot
of dead migrant workers here.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.892
Their families are asking
a lot of questions.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.894
I could really use somebody
on damage control.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.697
So...get here.
(beep)

14:25.699 --> 14:27.966
He could be anywhere.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.667
Oh, God. What did I do?!

14:29.669 --> 14:32.503
Stan, you're hiding it
really well, bro,

14:32.505 --> 14:35.240
but I know you,
and you seem stressed.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.309
I have something to tell you,
and you're not gonna like it.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.744
I work for the C.I.A.,

14:39.746 --> 14:42.146
and I was sent undercover
to investigate you guys.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.716
But why?
We're not bad guys.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.684
I know.
You're<i> awesome</i> guys.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.987
So awesome,
I decided to frame you

14:48.989 --> 14:50.688
so I could stay undercover.

14:50.690 --> 14:54.859
I robbed a bank and made
the C.I.A. think you did it.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.195
It's cool.
You're not mad?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.397
What? Because you made us
enemies of the state?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.866
We can't get hung up
on every little thing.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.335
The thing is, if we go to
the wave that goes out,

15:04.337 --> 15:06.070
they'll probably find us.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.673
And if they do, they'll shoot
first and ask questions later.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.541
I get it, dude.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.410
Hey, guys!
Put out the bonfire.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.046
Stan's in the C.I.A.
and framed us for a crime.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.515
His boss will kill us
if he, like, finds us,

15:17.517 --> 15:20.051
which means we're not going to
surf the wave that goes out.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.386
Cool.
Sounds good.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.687
Righteous.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.289
(hisses)

15:26.293 --> 15:29.794
I'm sorry you guys aren't gonna
be able to surf that wave.

15:29.796 --> 15:33.031
Do you guys think
the stars have waves?

15:33.033 --> 15:34.632
I bet they do, man.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.702
I bet there's even aliens
that surf those star waves.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.773
They probably even have
a<i> Space Surfer</i> magazine.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.309
You know there's
so many sick photos

15:44.311 --> 15:47.045
of aliens riding waves
in that magazine.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.114
Wow, nothing really fazes
you guys, huh?

15:50.116 --> 15:53.184
(insects chirping)

15:57.390 --> 15:58.723
Do you have any secrets?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.258
I got one secret.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.627
How about I tell you a secret,
then you tell me yours?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.462
I can't tell ya my secret.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.432
If I tell ya,
you won't like me anymore.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.168
Impossible.
You could tell me anything.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.270
We'll be friends
to the end.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.604
Yeah.

16:13.606 --> 16:17.008
Friends to the<i> very end.</i>

16:17.010 --> 16:19.744
Man, this is the best.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.414

What do you see over there?

but there<i> are</i> worries.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.950
There are lots of worries.

16:58.952 --> 17:01.185
For instance,
I'm standing on a jellyfish,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.287
and the jellyfish
has attracted wolves...

17:03.289 --> 17:07.392
(growling)
...and the wolves are being
hunted by poachers.

Oh, great, Smith.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.211
Now I have to start counting
all over.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.846
Stan,
what are you doing here?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.081
We told you not to worry.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.416
The thing is, I'm a worrier.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.252
I was worrying about my family,
and that stressed me out,

18:08.254 --> 18:10.021
so I tried to get away
from them.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.623
But I just started worrying
about you guys.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.526
Turns out if I love someone,
I worry about them.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.895
And if someone's gonna
stress me out,

18:17.897 --> 18:20.465
I'd rather it be my family
than you guys.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.468
Did Stan just say
he loves us?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.636
He did, Gorney. He did.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.939
I robbed the bank.
It was me.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.707
I did it because I wanted
to keep hanging out

18:29.709 --> 18:31.943
with my friends.
They're not your friends!

18:31.945 --> 18:34.612
Friends wouldn't let you
rob a bank all by yourself.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.116
I'd be shoulder to shoulder
with you, Smith, blasting away!

18:38.118 --> 18:40.151
Just...like...this!

Get out of here!
Fire!

18:41.888 --> 18:43.221
(gunshots)

18:43.223 --> 18:45.323
Kai, what should we do?!

18:45.325 --> 18:48.192
Whatever you do,
don't worry!

18:50.263 --> 18:52.130
Hang dead.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.298
(rocket whooshes)

18:56.970 --> 19:00.404
It's real, Stan!
The wave that goes out is real!

19:00.406 --> 19:04.442
I'll never forget you!

19:04.444 --> 19:06.978
Damn! Looks like
they got away.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.580
But a wave can only
go out so far

19:09.582 --> 19:13.084
before it's a wave
coming back in somewhere else.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.154
And I've got a hot tip
on where that might be.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.223
(surf rock music playing)

19:22.929 --> 19:24.495
Where?

19:28.501 --> 19:29.934
Dad, great news.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.936
My nameless friend
just finished making wine

19:31.938 --> 19:33.271
in the upstairs toilet.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.139
Now we're gonna bottle it.
Wanna watch?

19:35.141 --> 19:36.607
Hey, Mr. S.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.043
(sighs) It's been
a pretty stressful few days

19:39.045 --> 19:40.645
for Hayley and I.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.780
Unfortunately, the pregnancy
test came back negative.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.282
But it got us talking,

19:44.284 --> 19:46.551
and we've decided that
we're ready to have kids.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.885
All we're asking for is

19:47.887 --> 19:49.954
your emotional
and financial support.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.656
(hammering)

19:51.658 --> 19:53.558
Stan,
we lost the World Cup bid.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.226
But don't worry.
Don't worry.

19:55.228 --> 19:58.229
If we act fast, I think
we can get the Boston Marathon.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.831
(hammering)
Stop hammering!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.133
They'll have to find
somewhere else

20:02.135 --> 20:03.868
for people to run
the Boston Marathon!

20:03.870 --> 20:06.737
And you two! You're not even
close to ready to have kids!

20:06.739 --> 20:09.040
And, Steve, you numbnuts,
this man is a drifter!

20:09.042 --> 20:11.576
He needs to go!
But he doesn't have
anywhere to go!

20:11.578 --> 20:13.311
He has<i> everywhere!</i>

20:13.313 --> 20:15.413
Steve, don't argue
with your dad.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.181
He just saved your life.

20:17.183 --> 20:21.052
Boop! That was my secret.
(chuckles) Best get driftin'.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.187
Honey,
what's all the yelling?

20:23.189 --> 20:25.723
You're supposed to be
avoiding stress.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.091
I don't have to.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.593
I went back to the drug store,

20:28.595 --> 20:30.361
and that old crone
runs the photo department.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.164
So I went to a real doctor,
and he gave me pills,

20:33.166 --> 20:36.000
and I took all of them
because I love you idiots,

20:36.002 --> 20:37.335
and that causes me

20:37.337 --> 20:39.637
(slurring)
a lot of stress.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.841
It's okay.
He's breathing.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.509
Let's draw a dick
on his face.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.511
Of course I know what
one looks like,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.447
but, Hayley,
why don't you draw it?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.684
Hi, I'm big wave rider
Laird Hamilton.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.386
We made some jokes tonight

20:55.388 --> 20:58.422
about people abusing
prescription drugs.

20:58.424 --> 21:02.126
I just wanted to point that out.
It was pretty funny.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.128
Bye! Have a beautiful time!

21:06.132 --> 21:07.798
