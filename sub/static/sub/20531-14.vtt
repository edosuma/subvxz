Ryuji Yamane of the
Democratic Party of Japan,

04:27.720 --> 04:30.720
under increasing pressure
from his constituents,

04:30.720 --> 04:33.390
publicly demands a response

04:33.390 --> 04:35.730
from the prime minister
and his cabinet

04:35.730 --> 04:40.030
to address the surge
of UFO activity over Japan,

04:40.030 --> 04:43.990
totaling more than 300
reported sightings per month.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.780
The cabinet's official statement

04:48.780 --> 04:51.500
is that it "has not confirmed
the existence

04:51.500 --> 04:55.710
of unidentified flying objects
from outer space."

04:55.710 --> 04:58.750

Nobutaka Machimura

05:06.550 --> 05:08.640
announced on live television

05:08.640 --> 05:11.970
that regarding the question
of extraterrestrials,

05:11.970 --> 05:14.730
he definitely thinks they exist.

05:17.230 --> 05:22.570
Then, a week later, the Japanese
Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba

05:22.570 --> 05:25.900
revealed that he had been
carefully considering

05:25.900 --> 05:29.740
different response scenarios
for an alien invasion.

05:29.740 --> 05:32.040
And what he said is incredible.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.870
He said, and I quote,

05:33.870 --> 05:36.710
"There are no grounds
for us to deny

05:36.710 --> 05:39.840
"that there are
unidentified flying objects

05:39.840 --> 05:44.300
and some life forms
that controls them."

05:44.300 --> 05:48.510
Two years later,
the wife of the prime minister

05:48.510 --> 05:51.760
came out with an extraordinary
series of statements,

05:51.760 --> 05:56.810
in which she claimed that she
had been abducted by aliens,

05:56.810 --> 05:59.350
that she had traveled on a UFO.

05:59.350 --> 06:01.690
For the wife of the
prime minister to come out

06:01.690 --> 06:05.650
and make a statement like that
was absolutely unprecedented.

06:05.650 --> 06:09.740
I think the only reason
this isn't on the front page

06:09.740 --> 06:12.450
of every newspaper
in the world is that,

06:12.450 --> 06:15.200
certainly in the United States,
we do tend to be

06:15.200 --> 06:18.750
rather heavily focused on
English‐speaking countries,

06:18.750 --> 06:23.250
and, indeed, very U. S.‐centric
in our outlook.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.130
If the statements
being made in Japan

06:26.130 --> 06:28.430
were being made in America,

06:28.430 --> 06:31.930
it would be on every major
news network 24‐7.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.100
NARRATOR:
Could these profound statements

06:38.100 --> 06:41.810
coming from top Japanese
government officials reveal

06:41.810 --> 06:44.820
that they have knowledge
of alien visitation?

06:44.820 --> 06:48.110
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

06:48.110 --> 06:51.620
evidence of alien contact
on these islands

06:51.620 --> 06:54.660
dates back thousands of years,

06:54.660 --> 06:58.500
and can be found within
the teachings of Shintoism.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.540
Shintoism is
the primary religion of Japan,

07:02.540 --> 07:06.630
with over 107 million followers,

07:06.630 --> 07:10.380
and is designed
around a set of ritual practices

07:10.380 --> 07:12.930
that connect present‐day Japan

07:12.930 --> 07:16.430
to its ancient mystical past.

07:16.430 --> 07:19.480
At its center
are celestial beings

07:19.480 --> 07:21.900
that, according
to the Japanese people,

07:21.900 --> 07:24.860
still roam their islands
to this day.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.030
The term "Shinto" translates
as "the way of the <i>kami,"</i>

07:30.030 --> 07:32.320
or, uh, "the way of the gods."

07:32.320 --> 07:34.530
It's a tradition

07:34.530 --> 07:38.620
that has a millennia‐long
history in Japan.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.620
There are
over eight million <i>kamis,</i>

07:40.620 --> 07:42.170
according
to the Shinto tradition,

07:42.170 --> 07:44.210
and each one of them has

07:44.210 --> 07:47.840
its own particular
personality traits, if you will.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.710
So, in that sense,
they are quite different

07:49.710 --> 07:52.300
from the notion
of monotheistic God that we have

07:52.300 --> 07:57.350
in traditions that are
most widespread in the West.

07:57.350 --> 07:59.270
The <i>kami</i> are
these celestial beings

07:59.270 --> 08:01.850
that are able
to inhabit basically anything,

08:01.850 --> 08:04.480
from a human being

08:04.480 --> 08:07.940
to an animal,
and even inanimate objects.

08:07.940 --> 08:12.490
So on the one hand, they're
these multi‐dimensional beings,

08:12.490 --> 08:14.410
but then,
they also describe them

08:14.410 --> 08:18.410
as having come down from their
celestial palace in the sky,

08:18.410 --> 08:22.370
which is called Takamagahara.

08:22.370 --> 08:24.960
The celestial <i>kami</i> will come
into the terrestrial world,

08:24.960 --> 08:27.880
our world, and they need a home,

08:27.880 --> 08:31.300
so they have these major shrines
for these <i>kami</i>

08:31.300 --> 08:33.090
when they come into the world,

08:33.090 --> 08:37.510
so that they can feel at home
in the terrestrial world.

08:37.510 --> 08:42.480
The Japanese archipelago is
dotted with over 81,000 shrines

08:42.480 --> 08:44.730
that are devoted
to the <i>kami</i> gods,

08:44.730 --> 08:47.860
and it's believed
that these are houses or places

08:47.860 --> 08:50.530
where these extraterrestrial
beings come to live

08:50.530 --> 08:52.320
when they're on Earth.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.990
The Japanese people will visit
the shrines of the <i>kami</i>

08:54.990 --> 08:57.160
with the belief
that they are actually praying

08:57.160 --> 09:00.660
to an extraterrestrial being
who can fulfill their blessings.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.960
NARRATOR: If what Shinto
followers call "the <i>kami"</i>

09:06.960 --> 09:09.290
really are otherworldly beings

09:09.290 --> 09:12.590
that have been visiting Japan
since ancient times,

09:12.590 --> 09:17.840
are they still being encountered
today in the form of UFOs?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.680
Perhaps further clues
can be found

09:20.680 --> 09:24.020
by examining ancient
Japanese structures

09:24.020 --> 09:26.770
that defy explanation.

09:34.110 --> 09:38.660
WILLIAM HENRY: There are
thousands of these statuettes

09:38.660 --> 09:42.950
Near the modern‐day city
of Osaka,

09:42.950 --> 09:45.330
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets

09:45.330 --> 09:49.210
with fellow ancient astronaut
theorist Takeharu Mikami

09:49.210 --> 09:52.880
to investigate one
of the oldest and holiest sites

09:52.880 --> 09:57.300
in the country‐‐
the Ishi‐no‐Hoden megalith,

09:57.300 --> 10:00.100
a Shinto shrine said
to be inhabited

10:00.100 --> 10:03.060
by an otherworldly being.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.270
(speaking Japanese)

10:12.270 --> 10:13.980
This is...

10:13.980 --> 10:15.280
I had no idea.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.780

10:20.820 --> 10:23.790
TSUKAMOTO: The rock itself
is said to weigh about 500 tons.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.950
‐500 tons?
‐Yes.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.120
Wow!

10:28.960 --> 10:30.580
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

10:32.540 --> 10:35.510
TSUKAMOTO: This is said
to have the soul of a god,

10:35.510 --> 10:37.630
or <i>kami,</i> inside it.

10:37.630 --> 10:40.220
Okay, so to this day,

10:40.220 --> 10:43.300
this is the belief,
that some type of spirit

10:43.300 --> 10:45.350
lives in this,

10:45.350 --> 10:48.850
or that the rock itself
has spirit.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.400
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

10:50.400 --> 10:52.860
TSUKAMOTO:
The spirit of a god is inside,

10:52.860 --> 10:56.820
and the stone carries
a special spiritual meaning now.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.530
TSOUKALOS:
Okay. That's amazing.

10:58.530 --> 11:01.410
I want to...
I need to walk around.

11:03.370 --> 11:06.830
I mean, I had no idea
how massive this is.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.500
(Mikami speaks Japanese)

11:09.500 --> 11:11.670
(Tsoukalos speaks Japanese)

11:11.670 --> 11:14.170
So, do you want
to just look down below here?

11:14.170 --> 11:15.710
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

11:15.710 --> 11:18.210
TSUKAMOTO: It looks like
it's floating over the water.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.800
TSOUKALOS:
It really does.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.470
‐Oh.
‐(Mikami speaking Japanese)

11:22.470 --> 11:25.010
TSUKAMOTO: The name
for this rock is <i>Ame‐no‐kishi,</i>

11:25.010 --> 11:27.020
or the Floating Rock
from the Heavens.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.890
(speaking Japanese)

11:31.440 --> 11:33.560
TSUKAMOTO: So this monolith
is said to be related

11:33.560 --> 11:35.650
to one of the first gods

11:35.650 --> 11:38.230
that descended
from the heavens to Japan,

11:38.230 --> 11:42.240
and he is said to have traveled
over the country

11:42.240 --> 11:44.820
on a sky ship
made out of a giant rock,

11:44.820 --> 11:48.330
which was called <i>Ama no Iwafune,</i>

11:48.330 --> 11:51.250
which is
the Heavenly Rock Ship.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.120
So what you're telling me
is that there is

11:53.120 --> 11:56.500
an ancient Japanese legend
that speaks of a deity

11:56.500 --> 11:58.710
flying around in the sky

11:58.710 --> 12:02.880
with a gigantic vehicle
made of stone?

12:02.880 --> 12:05.090
‐(speaks Japanese)
‐Absolutely.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.680
(chuckles)
So, do you think

12:06.680 --> 12:10.060
that is the reason
why it was called

12:10.060 --> 12:15.020
a vehicle made of stone, because
it was so powerful and strong

12:15.020 --> 12:19.150
and virtually indestructible
that the story became

12:19.150 --> 12:21.280
it's a vehicle made of stone?

12:21.280 --> 12:24.110
(speaking Japanese)

12:24.110 --> 12:25.870
TSUKAMOTO:
You're absolutely right,

12:25.870 --> 12:27.490
because the gods were...

12:27.490 --> 12:30.750
flying over the land
on a giant ship.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.660
It wasn't a plane,
because it didn't have wings.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.040
It looked like a ship

12:34.040 --> 12:36.250
made out of very hard material

12:36.250 --> 12:39.000
that was like a very hard stone,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.970
and they would descend from the
heavens and down onto the land,

12:42.970 --> 12:45.590
and thus, they would travel
around the country.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.890
TSOUKALOS:
Another name for <i>Ishi‐no‐Hoden</i>

12:47.890 --> 12:49.600
is Floating Stone.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.640
So what did they mean by that?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.640
The way that this
is constructed here,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.270
it seems as if it's hovering.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.440
So did they perhaps try

12:58.440 --> 13:01.990
to recreate one of those
hovering or flying sky ships

13:01.990 --> 13:04.780
that they themselves witnessed?

13:04.780 --> 13:08.070
And what's so interesting to me
about this massive monolith

13:08.070 --> 13:10.240
is that there are
no apparent toolmarks

13:10.240 --> 13:13.830
to be found at any place
across the stone.

13:13.830 --> 13:17.830
How did ancient people possibly
quarry and form this rock

13:17.830 --> 13:21.550
to such exacting precision
without sophisticated tools?

13:23.340 --> 13:25.760
NARRATOR:
According to the Japanese,

13:25.760 --> 13:28.680
otherworldly beings
had been visiting their islands

13:28.680 --> 13:31.640
for over 12,000 years.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.930
The earliest culture
that we can identify in Japan

13:33.930 --> 13:35.770
is the Jomon,

13:35.770 --> 13:39.940
which is originally
a Stone Age culture

13:39.940 --> 13:44.820
running roughly
from 10,000 BCE to 300 BCE.

13:46.530 --> 13:49.700
It is a culture that we
don't know an awful lot about,

13:49.700 --> 13:51.280
because they had
no writing system.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.200
All we have is artifacts.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.830
DOMINIC STEAVU: The little that
we do know about the <i>Jomon</i>

13:56.830 --> 13:59.580
comes from
archaeological evidence.

13:59.580 --> 14:03.250
And... one of the most
representative, uh,

14:03.250 --> 14:06.170
artifacts that is tied
to the <i>Jomon</i>

14:06.170 --> 14:08.010
is the Dogu statue.

14:11.970 --> 14:15.640
NARRATOR: Approximately
15,000 Dogu figurines

14:15.640 --> 14:18.520
resembling strange,
humanoid beings

14:18.520 --> 14:22.440
have been found
throughout the Japanese islands.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.240
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest these figurines

14:26.240 --> 14:30.410
represent the very <i>kami</i>
the Japanese believe descended

14:30.410 --> 14:33.910
to this world
in the ancient past.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.950
HENRY: There are thousands
of these statuettes

14:35.950 --> 14:38.330
that have been recovered,
and these figures have

14:38.330 --> 14:42.500
goggle‐type eyes, and they
have rivets all over their body,

14:42.500 --> 14:45.170
indicating that they're wearing
some kind of a space suit

14:45.170 --> 14:46.880
or technological armor.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.970
DAVID CHILDRESS:
So you have to ask yourself,

14:50.970 --> 14:54.760
were these statues sky beings

14:54.760 --> 14:57.890
who came and directed
the Japanese

14:57.890 --> 15:02.310
to have their civilization and
culture, and that ultimately,

15:02.310 --> 15:04.770
these sky gods
are their ancestors?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.610
NARRATOR: Do the <i>Dogu</i> figures
represent extraterrestrials

15:10.610 --> 15:14.830
that visited Japan
thousands of years ago?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.330
And could they
have descended in a craft

15:17.330 --> 15:20.670
that resembled the monolith
called <i>Ishi‐no‐Hoden,</i>

15:20.670 --> 15:23.170
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

15:25.880 --> 15:28.300
Perhaps further clues
can be found

15:28.300 --> 15:31.090
in Japan's official
historical texts,

15:31.090 --> 15:33.260
which describe the islands

15:33.260 --> 15:36.760
as inhabited
by otherworldly beings.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.230
Ise, Japan.

15:43.230 --> 15:46.440
In the center
of this remote coastal city

15:46.440 --> 15:51.490
is a massive complex
of 125 individual shrines

15:51.490 --> 15:54.620
erected 2,000 years ago,

15:54.620 --> 15:58.240
dedicated to the supreme goddess
of Shintoism‐‐

15:58.240 --> 16:00.540
Amaterasu.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.620
THOMAS KASULIS:
When Amaterasu is residing

16:02.620 --> 16:06.590
in the terrestrial plane,
instead of the celestial plane,

16:06.590 --> 16:10.510
her home is
the Grand Shrine at Ise,

16:10.510 --> 16:12.800
which is built
without any nails,

16:12.800 --> 16:15.510
any metal fastenings whatsoever.

16:15.510 --> 16:19.430
It's also architecturally unlike
any other shrine in Japan.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.600
TSOUKALOS: Modern architects
still have difficulty

16:23.600 --> 16:26.360
comprehending
how this palace was built.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.190
It is the most important shrine
in Shintoism,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.910
and has been visited by hundreds
of millions of pilgrims

16:34.910 --> 16:36.870
over thousands of years.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.830
Now, allegedly,

16:38.830 --> 16:41.790
the shrine contains something
called the Sacred Mirror,

16:41.790 --> 16:45.000
one of Japan's
three most sacred artifacts,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.040
which are collectively known

16:47.040 --> 16:50.800
as the Imperial Regalia
of Japan.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.760
They were given by Amaterasu
to Emperor Jimmu,

16:54.760 --> 16:57.800
the first emperor of Japan.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.100
And they have only been seen

17:00.100 --> 17:02.930
by the emperors
and high priests of Japan.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.730
But what were they?

17:04.730 --> 17:07.730
And why is the public
not allowed to see them?

17:09.190 --> 17:11.570
If these are items
that are brought to Earth

17:11.570 --> 17:14.950
by celestial beings,
then by definition,

17:14.950 --> 17:18.530
that would make them
of extraterrestrial origin.

17:20.910 --> 17:24.540
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Ishi‐no‐Hoden megalith

17:24.540 --> 17:28.000
and the Ise Grand Shrine
are physical evidence

17:28.000 --> 17:32.920
of extraterrestrial visitations
in Japan's ancient past?

17:32.920 --> 17:36.430
And might the prime minister
of Japan and his cabinet

17:36.430 --> 17:38.470
still have connections

17:38.470 --> 17:41.560
to these same
otherworldly beings?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.930
Perhaps the answer can be found

17:43.930 --> 17:47.440
by more closely examining
Emperor Jimmu,

17:47.440 --> 17:49.940
and the stories
that he was guided

17:49.940 --> 17:52.650
by an intelligence
that spoke to him...

17:52.650 --> 17:56.500
from the sky.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.980
In the middle
of this modern metropolis

18:07.980 --> 18:10.230
lies the Daisen Kofun,

18:10.230 --> 18:14.610
a tomb for one of Japan's
long line of divine emperors.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.910
Covering over 400,000
square meters, the Daisen Kofun

18:20.910 --> 18:24.870
is considered the largest tomb
by area in the world.

18:27.210 --> 18:30.580
There are more
than 160,000 kofun

18:30.580 --> 18:33.130
dotting
the Japanese archipelago,

18:33.130 --> 18:35.510
all of which contain the remains

18:35.510 --> 18:37.840
of emperors
or their royal families.

18:39.470 --> 18:43.470
STEAVU: There are burial mounds
throughout the world.

18:43.470 --> 18:47.180
However, there's one specific
shape that exists only in Japan,

18:47.180 --> 18:48.810
and this is the Keyhole Kofun.

18:51.060 --> 18:54.400
JASON MARTELL: Most of these
can only be seen from the sky.

18:56.110 --> 18:59.360
This raises the question as
to why emperors would be buried

18:59.360 --> 19:02.240
in such a way that they
are actually being memorialized

19:02.240 --> 19:03.990
and being seen from the sky.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.790
CHILDRESS: The Japanese
believed that the royal family

19:08.790 --> 19:13.170
was descended from gods
that came from the sky.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.050
So we have to wonder,

19:15.050 --> 19:17.550
is this a way
for the extraterrestrials

19:17.550 --> 19:20.880
to identify the tombs
of their ancestors?

19:23.390 --> 19:25.600
NARRATOR:
Could the thousands of kofun

19:25.600 --> 19:27.930
dotting the Japanese islands

19:27.930 --> 19:32.020
contain the bodies
of extraterrestrial beings?

19:34.270 --> 19:37.530
Curiously, in 2016,

19:37.530 --> 19:40.200
researchers studying
high‐resolution photos

19:40.200 --> 19:41.990
of the surface of Mars

19:41.990 --> 19:45.240
spotted an eerily similar
keyhole‐shaped mound.

19:46.950 --> 19:49.790
JASON MARTELL: Is this possibly
a kofun found on Mars,

19:49.790 --> 19:52.370
burying some lost
extraterrestrial god?

19:52.370 --> 19:54.420
If so, we can see that there's

19:54.420 --> 19:57.500
definitely a connection between
what we're seeing on Mars,

19:57.500 --> 20:00.010
as some type
of kofun burial site,

20:00.010 --> 20:03.390
and over 160,000
of these found all over Japan.

20:08.060 --> 20:10.270
NARRATOR:
Could the kofuns in Japan,

20:10.270 --> 20:12.770
and the alleged structure
on Mars,

20:12.770 --> 20:15.270
contain definitive proof
of a link

20:15.270 --> 20:18.070
to beings
from outside our world?

20:21.650 --> 20:23.950
To investigate
this theory further,

20:23.950 --> 20:27.450
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and Takeharu Mikami

20:27.450 --> 20:32.080
were granted special access to
one of Japan's oldest tombs...

20:32.080 --> 20:34.790
the Ishibutai Kofun.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.630
TSOUKALOS:
Oh, man, it's gigantic.

20:38.630 --> 20:42.220
TSUKAMOTO: It's a megalith
from sixth century AD.

20:42.220 --> 20:44.300
Okay.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.430
(speaking Japanese)

20:47.430 --> 20:49.350
TSUKAMOTO:
The largest rock on this tumulus

20:49.350 --> 20:52.810
weighs about 77 tons.

20:52.810 --> 20:56.600
Have they calculated the weight
of all the rocks combined?

20:56.600 --> 20:59.730
(speaking Japanese)

20:59.730 --> 21:02.650
All together, this would weigh
about 2,300 tons.

21:02.650 --> 21:03.990
TSOUKALOS:
Wow!

21:03.990 --> 21:06.490
That's incredible.

21:06.490 --> 21:07.820
Can we go inside?

21:07.820 --> 21:09.120
‐Yes.
‐All right.

21:21.090 --> 21:23.010
Wow.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.510
So I presume one
of these rocks up there

21:26.510 --> 21:28.640
is the one that's 77 tons.

21:28.640 --> 21:32.560
We would have great difficulty
achieving that today.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.100
And I'm not saying
we can't do it.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.060
Of course we can do it.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.690
But we would use sophisticated,

21:38.690 --> 21:41.480
high‐tech, heavy machinery.

21:41.480 --> 21:46.200
TSUKAMOTO: Excavation visitors
have found wooden sleds

21:46.200 --> 21:48.410
that are said
to have been the tools

21:48.410 --> 21:50.740
they used to drag and carry

21:50.740 --> 21:54.080
these large rocks
across the fields.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.870
However, we don't know
exactly how and from where

21:56.870 --> 21:59.580
these rocks were carried from.

21:59.580 --> 22:01.920
Yeah, I completely and utterly
disagree with that notion.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.340
You put 77 tons on wood,

22:04.340 --> 22:07.090
it crushes into dust.

22:07.090 --> 22:11.180
So that's wonderful
that these sleds were found,

22:11.180 --> 22:13.930
but I highly doubt

22:13.930 --> 22:17.730
that 77 tons were
on wooden sleds.

22:17.730 --> 22:22.400
Because I've once seen
a five‐ton block being placed

22:22.400 --> 22:23.820
on wooden rollers,

22:23.820 --> 22:26.490
and it got crushed
into oblivion.

22:26.490 --> 22:28.030
This area here,

22:28.030 --> 22:31.370
it's very hilly,
uh, mountainous.

22:31.370 --> 22:33.660
So in those ancient texts,

22:33.660 --> 22:38.160
does it say how these stones
were moved into position?

22:38.160 --> 22:39.830
(speaking Japanese)

22:39.830 --> 22:42.500
TSUKAMOTO: Traditionally,
there were a group

22:42.500 --> 22:45.880
of very skilled artisans
or architects

22:45.880 --> 22:49.840
who held a lot of, uh,
secret skills and technology

22:49.840 --> 22:51.390
that was only kept to them.

22:51.390 --> 22:53.140
But, unfortunately,

22:53.140 --> 22:57.060
we don't know what exactly those
skills and technologies were.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.350
TSOUKALOS: I agree that
there was engineering knowledge

22:59.350 --> 23:01.060
that has been lost.

23:01.060 --> 23:03.610
And to build something
like this,

23:03.610 --> 23:06.940
does he presume
that this knowledge

23:06.940 --> 23:10.660
may have come from some of
those <i>kamis</i> or celestial beings

23:10.660 --> 23:14.120
that are
in Japanese mythologies?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.200
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

23:17.200 --> 23:19.410
TSUKAMOTO: So the further back
in history we go,

23:19.410 --> 23:22.580
‐the greater these monuments
become. ‐TSOUKALOS: Yes.

23:22.580 --> 23:25.460
So the technology was there
from the very beginning.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.090
And if we go back in time

23:27.090 --> 23:30.180
to follow these roots
of these beings, we will go back

23:30.180 --> 23:33.850
to prehistoric times
of the‐the era, the age

23:33.850 --> 23:36.390
of the <i>kamis</i> or the deities.

23:36.390 --> 23:38.770
Ancient Japanese Shintos believe

23:38.770 --> 23:42.230
that once you die,
you would be put into a coffin

23:42.230 --> 23:43.610
that was shaped like a boat

23:43.610 --> 23:46.770
and then travel
to the land of the gods.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.320
You know, that's so fascinating,
because...

23:51.320 --> 23:55.450
there are stories
of flying boats

23:55.450 --> 23:56.740
all around the world.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.750
In ancient Egypt,

23:58.750 --> 24:03.040
you have the sun barges
descending from the sky.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.830
In Native American cultures,

24:04.830 --> 24:08.420
you have the flying canoes.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.300
Why would they label a boat
a flying boat?

24:12.300 --> 24:15.300
Well, could it be perhaps
because they didn't have

24:15.300 --> 24:18.060
the vocabulary to say
"airplane"?

24:18.060 --> 24:20.560
I don't think our ancestors
pulled this

24:20.560 --> 24:22.270
out of their own imagination.

24:22.270 --> 24:25.480
I think
they actually saw flying boats,

24:25.480 --> 24:28.980
and thus the legends were born.

24:31.150 --> 24:34.110
NARRATOR: Might the Ishibutai
Kofun have been built

24:34.110 --> 24:37.620
with the help
of extraterrestrial beings,

24:37.620 --> 24:42.870
beings that were also present
on Mars in the distant past?

24:42.870 --> 24:46.750
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

24:46.750 --> 24:49.000
and suggest further clues
can be found

24:49.000 --> 24:53.090
by examining another mysterious
megalithic structure,

24:53.090 --> 24:57.640
one that some believe represents
the so‐called flying boats

24:57.640 --> 25:01.140
that, according
to the ancient Japanese stories,

25:01.140 --> 25:04.520
were used to travel
to the land of the gods.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.850
NARRATOR:
Hitachi Province, Japan.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.230
1803.

25:22.810 --> 25:26.070
Local fishermen
on the Harayadori shore

25:26.070 --> 25:30.320
spot an unusual craft drifting
in the distance.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.820
When the vessel washes ashore,

25:32.820 --> 25:35.700
they are astonished
by what they witness.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.830
NICK POPE: This craft was
likened to the shape

25:41.830 --> 25:43.880
of a Japanese incense burner.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.460
It is almost literally
a flying disk,

25:46.460 --> 25:48.970
a flying saucer.

25:48.970 --> 25:51.340
On the outside of this craft

25:51.340 --> 25:55.220
were multiple
small metal plates,

25:55.220 --> 25:58.560
uh, not too dissimilar
to heat‐resistant tiles

25:58.560 --> 26:01.440
that you'd find, say,
on a space shuttle.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.940
NICK REDFERN:
A hatch opened,

26:06.940 --> 26:09.650
and a young woman came out
of the craft

26:09.650 --> 26:13.820
dressed in clothes
that had never been seen before

26:13.820 --> 26:16.660
and speaking a language
that nobody understood

26:16.660 --> 26:18.160
in the slightest.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.000
CHILDRESS: When they looked
inside the craft,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.630
they could see hieroglyphs

26:23.630 --> 26:26.960
and strange writing
all inside of the craft.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.800
POPE: The story
of the strange Utsuro Bune craft

26:30.800 --> 26:35.180
appears in
three different Japanese texts.

26:35.180 --> 26:39.560
Even today, modern historians,
uh, struggle to understand

26:39.560 --> 26:42.390
what this means.

26:42.390 --> 26:45.190
Nobody can really decipher this.

26:47.570 --> 26:51.320
CHILDRESS: Japanese today are
very familiar with this story.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.360
And to them,
this is a curious story

26:54.360 --> 26:58.990
of one of the gods
of their ancestry

26:58.990 --> 27:02.620
who had somehow arrived there
on the island

27:02.620 --> 27:04.540
in this mysterious craft

27:04.540 --> 27:07.540
and then departed.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.920
NARRATOR:
Could the Utsuro Bune incident

27:12.920 --> 27:16.050
have marked the return
of extraterrestrial beings

27:16.050 --> 27:20.430
that were present in Japan
in the distant past?

27:20.430 --> 27:23.850
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

27:23.850 --> 27:26.770
and claim further evidence
can be found

27:26.770 --> 27:29.730
by examining
a strange monolithic stone

27:29.730 --> 27:32.990
that many believe was carved
to resemble the very craft

27:32.990 --> 27:37.700
that have been visiting Japan
for thousands of years.

27:44.660 --> 27:47.040
Asuka Park, Japan.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.090
April 2017.

27:50.090 --> 27:52.010
Does that say "rock ship"?

27:52.010 --> 27:54.090
‐"Masuda Rock Ship, this way."
‐Oh, all right.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.720
NARRATOR:
Giorgio Tsoukalos

27:57.720 --> 28:01.350
and ancient astronaut theorist
Takeharu Mikami

28:01.350 --> 28:04.520
set out to examine
Masuda‐no‐Iwafune,

28:04.520 --> 28:07.440
an 800‐ton rock structure

28:07.440 --> 28:10.650
that was carved from a single
piece of granite and resembles

28:10.650 --> 28:13.610
no other architecture in Japan.

28:13.610 --> 28:17.110
Hey, check out this‐this
square grid on the sides.

28:17.110 --> 28:19.910
I mean, this is something that
I've seen before in India,

28:19.910 --> 28:21.700
in Mahabalipuram,

28:21.700 --> 28:25.870
and they had something
very similar on the side

28:25.870 --> 28:27.080
of some of their rocks as well.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.460
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I can't wait to see the top.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.750
Amazing.

28:36.050 --> 28:37.720
Oh, man.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.050
‐TSUKAMOTO: Whoa.
‐(chuckles)

28:39.050 --> 28:41.810
‐Wow. That is...
‐(Tsukamoto speaks Japanese)

28:41.810 --> 28:43.350
(chuckles)
I mean,

28:43.350 --> 28:46.730
I've never seen anything
like it.

28:46.730 --> 28:49.400
NARRATOR:
While some researchers believe

28:49.400 --> 28:52.690
the Masuda‐no‐Iwafune megalith
is a tomb,

28:52.690 --> 28:56.360
others claim it is meant
to depict the sky boats

28:56.360 --> 29:00.490
that are described
in ancient Japanese stories.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.450
TSOUKALOS: So, the idea is
that this was the entrance

29:04.450 --> 29:05.750
to a Buddhist temple.
What do they mean by that?

29:05.750 --> 29:07.370
Inside... I mean, where?

29:07.370 --> 29:10.880
TSUKAMOTO: It would actually
predate Buddhism in Japan,

29:10.880 --> 29:12.960
so it wouldn't have anything
to do with Buddhist temples.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.590
Right. So,

29:14.590 --> 29:18.010
what is the actual translation
of "Masuda‐no‐Iwafune"?

29:18.010 --> 29:20.800
(speaking Japanese)

29:20.800 --> 29:23.220
"Masuda" is the name
of the region,

29:23.220 --> 29:24.850
and "iwafune" literally means

29:24.850 --> 29:27.100
"stone ship" or "rock ship."

29:27.100 --> 29:28.230
Okay.

29:28.230 --> 29:30.060
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

29:32.480 --> 29:34.940
TSUKAMOTO: Yes, it's...
naturally, the <i>iwafune</i>

29:34.940 --> 29:36.940
or the rock ship

29:36.940 --> 29:38.280
would have come down
from the heavens

29:38.280 --> 29:40.610
as a vehicle for the gods

29:40.610 --> 29:42.410
to descend upon Earth.

29:42.410 --> 29:46.160
TSOUKALOS: So, I guess with the
combination of the mythologies

29:46.160 --> 29:48.410
of celestial beings,
this could be

29:48.410 --> 29:51.420
some type of representation
of one

29:51.420 --> 29:54.290
of those flying vehicles
that our ancestors

29:54.290 --> 29:55.880
perhaps witnessed.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.800
NARRATOR:
Could the Masuda‐no‐Iwafune

30:01.800 --> 30:05.060
have been carved to resemble
the so‐called flying boats

30:05.060 --> 30:09.060
that were referred to
in ancient Japanese texts?

30:09.060 --> 30:12.310
And was a similar alien craft
witnessed

30:12.310 --> 30:16.480
by Japanese fishermen in 1803?

30:16.480 --> 30:19.530
Perhaps further clues
can be found

30:19.530 --> 30:23.700
by examining
much more recent UFO sightings

30:23.700 --> 30:27.490
and the long‐held belief
that Japan's imperial family

30:27.490 --> 30:31.620
has a connection
to otherworldly beings.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.260
NARRATOR:
Kyushu, Japan.

30:43.260 --> 30:47.600
The seventh century BC.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.980
According to Japan's earliest
known historical texts,

30:51.980 --> 30:56.230
Kojiki and Nihon Shoki,
it is from this point

30:56.230 --> 30:58.650
that the country's first ruler,

30:58.650 --> 31:01.030
Emperor Jimmu,
set out to conquer

31:01.030 --> 31:03.910
and unify
the Japanese islands.

31:03.910 --> 31:05.660
KASULIS: He seems
to have come out of Kyushu,

31:05.660 --> 31:07.330
the southern island,

31:07.330 --> 31:10.410
and moved across Japan
to find a better place

31:10.410 --> 31:12.500
to center the government
and center his realm,

31:12.500 --> 31:15.420
conquering people along the way,

31:15.420 --> 31:18.800
and eventually he settles
in the Yamato region.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.630
And that becomes the center
of Japan's government,

31:21.630 --> 31:25.180
all the way until it moves
to Tokyo in 1868.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.770
STEAVU: As he was working
his way northwards,

31:31.770 --> 31:35.400
he was actually assisted

31:35.400 --> 31:38.110
by a divine crow.

31:38.110 --> 31:41.740
A three‐legged crow,
known as Yatagarasu.

31:41.740 --> 31:44.490
"Yatagarasu" loosely translates

31:44.490 --> 31:45.950
to "eight span crow."

31:45.950 --> 31:47.660
So, we can imagine

31:47.660 --> 31:49.660
that this crow would have been
extremely large.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.290
(crow screeches)

31:51.290 --> 31:55.540
In some instances,
Yatagarasu is also depicted

31:55.540 --> 32:00.340
within a fiery orb in the sky.

32:00.340 --> 32:02.510
TSOUKALOS:
This so‐called "crow"

32:02.510 --> 32:04.880
guided him on his journey

32:04.880 --> 32:08.760
and advised him in military
matters to ensure his success.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.680
And, when you look at ancient
depictions of this crow,

32:11.680 --> 32:15.100
it is often depicted inside
some kind of an orb,

32:15.100 --> 32:17.150
this circular disc.

32:17.150 --> 32:20.020
So if you look at that,
you have to ask,

32:20.020 --> 32:24.490
what exactly were the ancient
Japanese talking about here?

32:24.490 --> 32:28.320
Because this, to me, sounds more

32:28.320 --> 32:32.620
like he was being guided
by some kind of a flying craft

32:32.620 --> 32:36.040
than an actual crow.

32:36.040 --> 32:40.250
NARRATOR: Could Japan's
first Emperor, Jimmu,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.550
and the imperial family today,

32:42.550 --> 32:47.010
be direct descendants
of extraterrestrials?

32:47.010 --> 32:50.350
And might the three‐legged crow,
Yatagarasu,

32:50.350 --> 32:54.430
really have been an alien craft?

32:54.430 --> 32:57.100
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

32:57.100 --> 33:00.400
and suggest further evidence
can be found

33:00.400 --> 33:04.400
by examining a military coup
designed to cover up

33:04.400 --> 33:07.360
this extraterrestrial heritage.

33:13.490 --> 33:17.830
Kyoto, Japan. 1183.

33:17.830 --> 33:23.380
Military general
Minamoto no Yoritomo

33:23.380 --> 33:26.010
besieges the capital city
of Japan,

33:26.010 --> 33:28.800
forcing the current
Emperor Antoku

33:28.800 --> 33:31.340
and his bodyguard to flee.

33:31.340 --> 33:35.010
For nearly 700 years after,

33:35.010 --> 33:38.140
military dictatorships
known as shogunates

33:38.140 --> 33:41.060
maintained strict control
over Japan.

33:41.060 --> 33:45.480
Isolationist policies
allowed few to enter

33:45.480 --> 33:49.320
or exit the islands, with death
as the ultimate penalty.

33:51.490 --> 33:56.200
Only in 1867 did shogun
Tokugawa Yoshinobu,

33:56.200 --> 34:00.420
facing a revolt
from the Japanese people,

34:00.420 --> 34:05.170
relinquish control of the
government back to the emperor.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.670
STEAVU: The Meiji Emperor was
the first of the emperors

34:07.670 --> 34:09.420
after the restoration.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.800
Made a point
of tracing his lineage

34:11.800 --> 34:14.140
all the way back
to Emperor Jimmu...

34:16.560 --> 34:19.850
...and to Amaterasu, as well.

34:19.850 --> 34:23.480
So, this notion
of a divine emperor,

34:23.480 --> 34:28.490
of a living <i>kami</i> at the head
of Japan, was resuscitated.

34:30.150 --> 34:33.490
They wanted to return to
the original Japanese empire,

34:33.490 --> 34:35.740
the one founded by Jimmu,

34:35.740 --> 34:38.290
and his connection with
the extraterrestrial beings.

34:38.290 --> 34:41.080
What happened after this
is extraordinary.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.330
Suddenly Japan takes off.

34:43.330 --> 34:46.800
It starts accelerating
in its technological ability.

34:46.800 --> 34:51.510
It suddenly becomes
a world‐conquering nation.

34:51.510 --> 34:55.680
By the early twentieth century,
Japan was a superpower

34:55.680 --> 35:00.140
and it had amassed
a vast colonial empire,

35:00.140 --> 35:04.400
rivaling that of the greatest
Western colonial empires.

35:04.400 --> 35:07.770
And what Japan accomplished
in modernization

35:07.770 --> 35:10.440
in the span of 20 years,

35:10.440 --> 35:12.490
it took most European nations

35:12.490 --> 35:15.870
about 200 or even 300 years
to accomplish.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.660
CHILDRESS:
So you have to wonder

35:21.660 --> 35:24.210
with the reinstating
of the royal family,

35:24.210 --> 35:28.090
was this also a reconnection

35:28.090 --> 35:31.840
to the technical and
extraterrestrial past

35:31.840 --> 35:36.260
that had begun centuries ago
in Japan,

35:36.260 --> 35:39.100
and is now continuing today,

35:39.100 --> 35:42.060
possibly with the guidance
of extraterrestrials?

35:46.900 --> 35:50.480
NARRATOR: Could Japan's
meteoric rise to power

35:50.480 --> 35:53.610
be a direct result of
reinstating the "divine,"

35:53.610 --> 35:56.490
perhaps extraterrestrial,
dynasty

35:56.490 --> 35:59.740
originally established
by Emperor Jimmu?

35:59.740 --> 36:04.250
And is this why some of Japan's
top government officials

36:04.250 --> 36:07.420
have recently made statements
supporting the notion

36:07.420 --> 36:10.550
that alien visitation is real?

36:10.550 --> 36:15.010
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

36:15.010 --> 36:20.430
and suggest further evidence of
an alien presence in Japan today

36:20.430 --> 36:25.140
can be found by examining
a recent mass UFO sighting.

36:27.980 --> 36:34.320
In July 2015, multiple witnesses
in and around the city of Osaka

36:34.320 --> 36:38.570
sighted a fleet of UFOs

36:38.570 --> 36:41.700
moving in a quite
extraordinary fashion

36:41.700 --> 36:45.410
in broad daylight
right over the city.

36:45.410 --> 36:49.460
And various people caught them
from different angles on camera.

36:49.460 --> 36:53.000
Now, the government was quick
to dismiss them as candles

36:53.000 --> 36:55.420
or lanterns in the sky.

36:55.420 --> 36:58.010
But the erratic movements
and patterns suggested

36:58.010 --> 36:59.970
that they were technological
in nature.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.270
NARRATOR:
Similar white orbs

37:06.270 --> 37:08.310
were reported
four years earlier,

37:08.310 --> 37:10.860
during one of the worst
environmental disasters

37:10.860 --> 37:13.110
in mankind's history.

37:13.110 --> 37:17.530
On March 26, 2011,

37:17.530 --> 37:20.740
two weeks after the meltdown
of the Fukushima Daiichi

37:20.740 --> 37:23.030
nuclear power plant
in Okuma, Japan,

37:23.030 --> 37:25.580
a fleet of white orbs

37:25.580 --> 37:30.750
was recorded
hovering over the site.

37:30.750 --> 37:34.920
If we go back and look at the
history of the UFO subject,

37:34.920 --> 37:37.470
we find a great deal
of interest with,

37:37.470 --> 37:40.720
for example,
our atomic energy plants,

37:40.720 --> 37:44.720
our nuclear missile silos.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.230
And it suggests to me that maybe

37:48.230 --> 37:51.770
we're seeing alien entities
who are deeply concerned

37:51.770 --> 37:55.440
by our usage of atomic power.

38:00.030 --> 38:04.160
NARRATOR: Could the white orbs
witnessed above Osaka

38:04.160 --> 38:08.120
and Fukushima
be alien craft belonging

38:08.120 --> 38:11.460
to the same celestial beings
the Japanese trace back

38:11.460 --> 38:13.790
to their very origins?

38:13.790 --> 38:17.300
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:17.300 --> 38:21.760
by examining recent attempts
by Japanese astronomers

38:21.760 --> 38:25.510
to make contact with
extraterrestrial beings.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.190
July 1983.

38:38.190 --> 38:43.110
At the University of Tokyo
Astronomical Observatory,

38:43.110 --> 38:47.990
astronomers Hisashi Hirabayashi
and Masaki Morimoto

38:47.990 --> 38:51.540
target a telescope
towards the star Altair.

38:51.540 --> 38:57.250
Using radio waves, they transmit
a short, binary‐encoded message

38:57.250 --> 39:00.970
in an attempt to contact
extraterrestrial life.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.680
This was a groundbreaking
piece of history

39:06.680 --> 39:09.520
in terms of the search
for extraterrestrial life.

39:09.520 --> 39:13.810
This message basically
told information

39:13.810 --> 39:17.690
regarding human life,
human history, DNA,

39:17.690 --> 39:20.780
and also the location
of the Earth itself.

39:20.780 --> 39:23.780
So, any potential
extraterrestrials

39:23.780 --> 39:26.570
living in the vicinity of Altair

39:26.570 --> 39:29.990
would potentially know
where we're coming from.

39:29.990 --> 39:34.120
CHILDRESS: The star of Altair is
16 light‐years away from Earth,

39:34.120 --> 39:36.540
and so it was expected

39:36.540 --> 39:38.960
that the binary message
would reach that star

39:38.960 --> 39:41.760
by around 1999.

39:41.760 --> 39:45.680
And now, from 2015 on,

39:45.680 --> 39:50.890
the Japanese are expecting some
kind of reply from their signal.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.560
REDFERN: Now, what's
particularly intriguing

39:53.560 --> 39:56.230
is that Altair
actually represents

39:56.230 --> 39:59.110
one of the ancient
Japanese gods.

39:59.110 --> 40:02.320
This makes me wonder
if the scientific community

40:02.320 --> 40:04.780
had come to a conclusion
that perhaps

40:04.780 --> 40:08.570
their ancient god,
represented by Altair,

40:08.570 --> 40:10.620
may not have been a god
after all.

40:10.620 --> 40:13.540
CHILDRESS:
So you have to wonder here,

40:13.540 --> 40:15.790
are these Japanese astronomers

40:15.790 --> 40:19.170
trying to contact
the extraterrestrial gods

40:19.170 --> 40:21.380
that they believe

40:21.380 --> 40:24.670
came to Earth and started
the Japanese civilization?

40:24.670 --> 40:26.090
It would seem so.

40:28.340 --> 40:33.470
NARRATOR: In 2010, JAXA,
Japan's national space program,

40:33.470 --> 40:36.560
announced plans to establish
a base on the moon

40:36.560 --> 40:38.860
by the year 2020.

40:38.860 --> 40:44.190
And recently, the Shimizu
Corporation unveiled designs

40:44.190 --> 40:46.610
for their LUNAR RING project,

40:46.610 --> 40:50.120
a massive band of solar panels
surrounding the moon

40:50.120 --> 40:55.750
that would beam limitless
clean power back to Earth.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.920
When you look at
all this together,

40:57.920 --> 41:00.540
you can't help but wonder
what's going on here?

41:00.540 --> 41:05.510
Is it about reaching out
to extraterrestrials,

41:05.510 --> 41:08.510
or is it perhaps about using

41:08.510 --> 41:11.640
extraterrestrial knowledge
and technology

41:11.640 --> 41:14.100
that the Japanese already have?

41:14.100 --> 41:18.600
HENRY: This suggests that the
Japanese people are serious

41:18.600 --> 41:21.190
about colonizing space

41:21.190 --> 41:23.190
and may be working with
extraterrestrials

41:23.190 --> 41:26.110
on developing this enormously
advanced technology.

41:26.110 --> 41:30.030
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that there is a link

41:30.030 --> 41:32.490
between Japan's
technological advancements

41:32.490 --> 41:37.000
and the country's connection
to extraterrestrial beings?

41:37.000 --> 41:42.210
And are these beings the same
otherworldly entities

41:42.210 --> 41:44.880
that have been influencing the
development of Japanese culture

41:44.880 --> 41:47.090
for thousands of years?

41:47.090 --> 41:50.550
Ancient astronaut theorists
say, yes,

41:50.550 --> 41:54.680
and believe the proof lies
not only at various locations

41:54.680 --> 41:57.350
found throughout
the Japanese landscape,

41:57.350 --> 42:00.230
but also on Earth's
neighboring planets...

42:00.230 --> 42:02.360
and one in particular...

42:02.360 --> 42:05.170
soon to be explored.
