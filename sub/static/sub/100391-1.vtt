[laughs softly]

20:24.793 --> 20:25.965
You a hero to me.

20:26.034 --> 20:28.965
- Careful, Tamika,
even heroes bleed.

20:33.137 --> 20:37.241
- Lewis Harper, age 27.
Typical entertainer playboy.

20:37.310 --> 20:40.655
Started in the industry
at the age of 17.

20:40.724 --> 20:46.827
Multiple DUIs, arrest for
public intoxication, mischief,

20:46.896 --> 20:50.551
trespassing, verbal assault,
minor drug offenses,

20:50.620 --> 20:52.379
and even urinating in public.

20:52.448 --> 20:55.137
And, oh yes let's not forget--
the sex tape.

20:55.206 --> 20:58.103
- No, let's.

20:58.172 --> 20:59.965
- Nice presentation, Tamika,

21:00.034 --> 21:03.034
but I need more information
than what you can Google.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.827
I need to know where he's been

21:04.896 --> 21:06.689
and what he's been doing
since the assault.

21:08.137 --> 21:09.931
- The police sent a squad car
to his residence.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.827
Nobody answered.
This boy's disappeared.

21:13.896 --> 21:16.000
- He's too high profile
to have just disappeared.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.517
Someone has to be helping him.

21:19.034 --> 21:22.586
I need you guys to dig deeper.
You know what I mean.

21:22.655 --> 21:24.896
- You know that type of intel
ain't our thing.

21:24.965 --> 21:27.517
Since you let Anthony go--
- I didn't let Anthony go.

21:27.586 --> 21:28.896
He took another job.

21:28.965 --> 21:31.000
- None of that matters because
we all know

21:31.068 --> 21:34.034
that kind of digging can
only be done by an expert, so.

21:34.103 --> 21:38.241
- What about that new mailroom
guy that Anthony recommended?

21:38.310 --> 21:39.551
- Bring him to me.

21:46.758 --> 21:49.103
- Colin Match.
- March, yes.

21:49.172 --> 21:51.965
- Do you have a new trainee
by the name of Steven Someone?

21:54.344 --> 21:55.931
- It's Sam Juan, not Someone.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.344
- My bad.

21:57.413 --> 21:59.000
So I take it you're him,
Steven?

21:59.068 --> 22:01.655
- Yeah, that's me.

22:01.724 --> 22:05.689
- Good, come with me please.
- What? Wait, wait.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.137
There must be some mistake.
He's still in training.

22:08.206 --> 22:11.413
- He just finished.

22:11.482 --> 22:13.068
Have a good day, Mr. Match.

22:13.137 --> 22:15.344
This way, Steven.

22:15.413 --> 22:16.827
- It's March.

22:20.137 --> 22:21.413
It's March.

22:23.137 --> 22:24.586
It says March.

22:26.517 --> 22:27.655
- Am I getting fired?

22:27.724 --> 22:31.620
- No, just focus, observe,

22:31.689 --> 22:34.068
and don't talk too much.

22:34.137 --> 22:36.931
- Have a seat, Mr. Sam Juan.
- Wow, you got it right.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.931
- I'll cut to the chase.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.241
I want to offer you a position
on my team

22:41.310 --> 22:42.758
as a special
digital researcher.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.448
- Digital researcher?

22:47.655 --> 22:49.793
- Full transparency:

22:49.862 --> 22:52.551
I want you to do
some hacking for me.

22:52.620 --> 22:55.655
- Is this an Asian thing?
- Are you serious?

22:55.724 --> 22:59.655
- Dude, that is so racist.
You're stereotyping me.

22:59.724 --> 23:02.586
You think that I can hack
just because I'm Asian?

23:02.655 --> 23:05.103
What, you heard about
the new Oriental dude
working in the mailroom?

23:05.172 --> 23:06.448
- Steven Sam Juan, age 27.

23:06.517 --> 23:09.034
Last four of your social,
3429.

23:09.103 --> 23:10.241
You still live
in your parents' basement.

23:10.310 --> 23:11.793
- Mm-hmm.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.620
- Okay, so you pulled
my resume.

23:13.689 --> 23:15.103
- Not just your resume.

23:15.172 --> 23:17.000
Because I know why you still
live with your parents.

23:17.068 --> 23:18.827
You hacked the United States
Federal Reserve

23:18.896 --> 23:21.206
in record time at age 15.

23:21.275 --> 23:25.206
The problem is you got caught,
went to juvie.

23:25.275 --> 23:28.758
- How--those records
are supposed to be sealed.

23:28.827 --> 23:30.551
- I'm sure you were just
a kid having fun,

23:30.620 --> 23:32.965
but now your parents
are in debt because of it.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.689
- What, are you blackmailing me
or something?

23:34.758 --> 23:36.758
- This is Hollywood, Sam Juan.

23:36.827 --> 23:38.551
People come here
from all over the world

23:38.620 --> 23:41.689
to become celebrities, but...

23:41.758 --> 23:44.620
fame is nothing compared
to power.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.551
- Mm.
- Power is gained many ways.

23:47.620 --> 23:50.344
One is through
the knowledge of secrets.

23:50.413 --> 23:51.965
Everyone has them.

23:52.034 --> 23:53.827
The lucky few take them
to their grave.

23:53.896 --> 23:55.827
The rest would kill
to keep them.

23:55.896 --> 23:58.241
That's what
makes them valuable.

23:58.310 --> 24:01.344
Secrets are currency
to me, Sam Juan.

24:01.413 --> 24:05.793
- So you want me to hack into
people's personal info

24:05.862 --> 24:07.000
to get you "currency?"

24:07.068 --> 24:09.551
- You're quick.

24:09.620 --> 24:11.137
- Well, I'm sorry,
I can't do it.

24:11.206 --> 24:12.551
If the feds found out
I was hacking again,

24:12.620 --> 24:14.724
I'll be finished.

24:14.793 --> 24:16.862
I'm not risking that
for you or for nobody.

24:16.931 --> 24:18.862
- My previous tech guy
was Anthony Rice.

24:18.931 --> 24:20.724
His hacker moniker
was Hannibal--

24:20.793 --> 24:23.344
- The Carthaginian?
Yo, are you serious?

24:23.413 --> 24:25.655
That dude's on
the Mount Rushmore of hackers.

24:25.724 --> 24:27.310
Where's he now?

24:27.379 --> 24:29.103
- Working for the NSA.

24:29.172 --> 24:32.551
- Listen, as insanely cool
as this is,

24:32.620 --> 24:34.586
I still don't think
I can do it.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.551
- Look, Sam Juan--
- Can you call me Steven?

24:36.620 --> 24:38.551
- No, sit down.

24:40.655 --> 24:43.413
I understand your hesitance.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.620
You're scared
you'll get caught again,

24:45.689 --> 24:47.103
and you want to do right
by your parents,

24:47.172 --> 24:48.896
which is why you took this job
to begin with.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.827
Well, that and your father's
rising medical bills.

24:51.896 --> 24:54.965
- Okay, can you stop doing
that, please?

24:55.034 --> 24:56.620
It's a little creepy that
you know everything about me.

24:56.689 --> 24:58.931
- My professional advice here
is that

24:59.000 --> 25:01.827
you should never
turn down an offer

25:01.896 --> 25:04.000
until you see
the proposed compensation.

25:07.793 --> 25:10.137
- Are you serious?

25:10.206 --> 25:12.137
- You could get your parents
out of debt in no time,

25:12.206 --> 25:14.310
and I can promise you that I'll
protect you and your family

25:14.379 --> 25:16.655
from anything we do here.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.241
What do you say, Sam Juan?

25:18.310 --> 25:21.275
- I say you should've
definitely started with this.

25:21.344 --> 25:22.793
- Is that a yes?

25:22.862 --> 25:25.896
- That's a yes.
- Good.

25:25.965 --> 25:27.896
- Get to work.
- Yes, Ms. Hernandez.

25:30.068 --> 25:32.000
- Thank you, Tamika.
- You're welcome.

25:35.310 --> 25:38.655
- I need you to check
the private airfields.

25:38.724 --> 25:39.896
They have a couple
of pilot friends, right?

25:39.965 --> 25:41.586
- Yeah, we've narrowed
it down to two.

25:41.655 --> 25:44.034
- I have the last cell tower
was Lewis pinged

25:44.103 --> 25:46.448
and all the numbers he called
within the last 48 hours.

25:46.517 --> 25:48.344
- This is it?

25:48.413 --> 25:51.379
He should be in a panic right
now calling everyone he knows.

25:51.448 --> 25:52.793
- Unless your boy got a burner.

25:54.206 --> 25:55.896
- All right, I need you
to figure out

25:55.965 --> 25:57.551
which one of these numbers
is his mother's.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.965
Trace it and if he does have
a burner,

26:00.034 --> 26:01.344
the new number
should show up there.

26:01.413 --> 26:03.068
- Help me out.

26:03.137 --> 26:04.724
What exactly
are we doing here?

26:04.793 --> 26:06.827
- Meaning?

26:06.896 --> 26:10.689
- I mean, this is an
entertainment law firm, right?

26:10.758 --> 26:13.551
Don't you just do contract
negotiations and stuff?

26:13.620 --> 26:14.896
Shouldn't we leave this
for the cops?

26:14.965 --> 26:16.448
Like, why are we getting
involved in this case?

26:16.517 --> 26:18.000
- Have a seat, Sam Juan.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.689
We're getting involved
because I know

26:24.758 --> 26:26.517
how the law works
and doesn't work.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.000
I'm doing this because,

26:28.068 --> 26:30.103
with the right team
of lawyers, right publicity,

26:30.172 --> 26:33.655
and right crooked judge,
Lewis would get off scot-free

26:33.724 --> 26:36.344
and sue Isis
for defamation of character.

26:36.413 --> 26:39.068
I'm doing this
because Isis is my client,

26:39.137 --> 26:41.724
and more importantly
she's my friend.

26:41.793 --> 26:42.793
So you and I need
to get something clear.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.758
If in the future you're curious

26:44.827 --> 26:47.413
as to why
we're doing something,

26:47.482 --> 26:50.689
the simple answer
is because I told you to.

27:01.344 --> 27:03.379
- You need anything else
from me tonight?

27:03.448 --> 27:05.620
- No thanks, Miguel.

27:05.689 --> 27:06.862
- Good night, ma'am.
- Night.

27:11.827 --> 27:13.827
- Gabriella.
- Good night, Miguel.

27:17.310 --> 27:18.896
- [sighs]

27:39.103 --> 27:41.241
You look just like your mother

27:41.310 --> 27:45.724
when she would come back
from the studio so tired.

27:45.793 --> 27:48.379
She was a workaholic
just like you.

27:48.448 --> 27:49.655
Don't be like her.

27:49.724 --> 27:51.000
- I don't know how else to be.

27:51.068 --> 27:53.275
- You need to be
your own woman.

27:53.344 --> 27:56.275
I keep telling you
that it's not healthy for you

27:56.344 --> 27:58.896
to live in the same house
as your mother.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.655
I think you need to sell it.

28:01.724 --> 28:03.965
This is not good for you.

28:04.034 --> 28:06.793
Too many goals.

28:06.862 --> 28:09.448
There's only so much sage
I can burn.

28:09.517 --> 28:12.275
- I'm never gonna sell it.
You know that.

28:12.344 --> 28:14.241
It's the only way
I feel close to her.

28:14.310 --> 28:17.103
- Don't forget your father
lived here too.

28:17.172 --> 28:19.034
Not openly, but he was here

28:19.103 --> 28:22.379
more than he was
with his own family.

28:22.448 --> 28:23.758
He cared so much
about your mother

28:23.827 --> 28:25.793
he bought this house cash

28:25.862 --> 28:27.310
so the two of you
would always have it.

28:27.379 --> 28:31.137
- Which is why I'm not leaving.
This house is all I have.

28:34.551 --> 28:37.655
It's hard being without them.
Barely having a memory.

28:37.724 --> 28:39.482
[laughs]

28:39.551 --> 28:41.000
I didn't even know
who my father was

28:41.068 --> 28:43.896
until a few years ago.

28:43.965 --> 28:47.103
All I know is
I was a secret--a mistake.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.862
- How many times
do I have to tell you

28:49.931 --> 28:51.896
that you were not a mistake?

28:51.965 --> 28:53.379
Would your father's life
have been ruined

28:53.448 --> 28:55.758
if they would have known
about you?

28:55.827 --> 28:57.034
Yes.

28:57.103 --> 29:01.931
But believe me,
he loved you so much.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.034
He always called you
his little angel.

29:07.103 --> 29:08.862
You always tell me that.

29:08.931 --> 29:11.827
Just wish I could remember it.
That I could remember anything.

30:44.724 --> 30:47.862
[pounding on door]

30:53.586 --> 30:55.103
- Were you trying to wake
the neighbors?

30:55.172 --> 30:58.896
- Where is he?
- Hello to you too, Daniella.

30:58.965 --> 31:01.586
- Is he here?
- Who? It's just me here.

31:02.793 --> 31:05.137
- Cut the act, Josh,

31:05.206 --> 31:07.965
I saw your office number
on his call log.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.034
When were you going to tell me
you started repping Lewis?

31:10.103 --> 31:12.586
- Look, we barely started
talking last week.

31:12.655 --> 31:14.275
Nothing's official yet.

31:14.344 --> 31:16.172
- And you just failed
to mention that to me?

31:16.241 --> 31:17.379
- Nothing's in ink.

31:17.448 --> 31:18.758
- You don't know
what he did to her.

31:18.827 --> 31:20.551
- Yeah, allegedly.
- Allegedly?

31:20.620 --> 31:22.103
Oh, is that the advice you're
going to give your client?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.344
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Just deny it all?

31:23.413 --> 31:24.482
- Don't tell me how
to do my job.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.517
- You didn't see her
in the hospital.

31:26.586 --> 31:29.172
Her jaw is wired shut.
Her face is cut and bruised.

with just a misdemeanor.

big promises.

your soul for fame?
