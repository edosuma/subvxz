00:01.667 --> 00:04.167
[instrumental music]

00:17.333 --> 00:19.750
Al, there you are.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.125
Sorry. We had a runaway problem
in New Orleans.

00:22.208 --> 00:24.917
Local office couldn't deal
with it, I had to step in.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.417
- It's fixed now.
- Good.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.292
Al, I want you to meet
Lauren Ashley and Chen Hikaru.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.875
They've just signed on
as interns

00:31.958 --> 00:33.833
with Level 12 investigations.

00:33.917 --> 00:36.792
This is Al Bester, the one
I was telling you about.

00:36.875 --> 00:40.083
It's an honor.
I've followed you for years.

00:40.167 --> 00:43.125
So you're the one that's been
peeking in my window at night.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.625
No, no, no, no, I meant

00:44.708 --> 00:46.000
I've been following your work,
I didn't mean, I was--

00:46.083 --> 00:48.292
Just playing, Chen.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.917
He's just a little nervous.
We both are.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.542
You-you're kind of a hero
where we come from.

00:53.625 --> 00:57.792
Uh, besides, we don't often see
a sense of humor in Psi Corps.

00:57.875 --> 01:01.625
Reports of our depression
are vastly exaggerated.

01:01.708 --> 01:04.167
Lauren and Chen are two
of our best young recruits

01:04.250 --> 01:05.750
for P12 work.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.750
They went through
basic training in record time

01:07.833 --> 01:09.958
they're eager
and they want to get into it.

01:10.042 --> 01:12.500
I figured I'd pair them up
with you for a while.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.000
You can, uh, show them the ropes

01:14.083 --> 01:15.833
get them comfortable
with the operation

01:15.917 --> 01:17.542
and then we'll put them out
in the field.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.000
I'd be happy to.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.250
So, where do you wanna start?

01:22.333 --> 01:25.667
Anywhere.
I'm just happy to be here.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.917
I like your attitude.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.875
Oh, I finished the report

01:29.958 --> 01:32.583
on the Babylon 5 situation
a few hours ago.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.417
You should have it
by mid-afternoon.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.125
Great. Thanks, Al.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.833
Good luck.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.542
If it's okay, I mean,
i-if it isn't classified

01:48.625 --> 01:50.917
I'd love to see a copy
of your analysis.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I've been following
the situation on Babylon 5

01:53.083 --> 01:55.208
as best I could for a while now.

01:55.292 --> 01:56.833
They've really made it
an unfriendly place for us

01:56.917 --> 01:58.000
haven't they?

01:58.083 --> 02:00.042
That's why you don't see
many of us up there.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.500
It just isn't worth it.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.750
Except on an emergency basis.

02:03.833 --> 02:07.042
But I thought Babylon 5 was
your main assignment these days.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.875
No. But I'm sure they think so.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.750
They have a tendency
to put their station

02:11.833 --> 02:14.625
at the center of the universe.

02:14.708 --> 02:17.000
A new doctor goes
on rounds at the asylum.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.333
He talks to one man.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.458
"And who are you," he asks.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.792
The patient says,
"I, sir, am Napoleon."

02:22.875 --> 02:25.458
"But how do you know you're
Napoleon," asks the doctor.

02:25.542 --> 02:26.917
"God told me."

02:27.000 --> 02:29.042
And from the next bed over comes

02:29.125 --> 02:31.000
"I did not."

02:31.083 --> 02:32.875
There's always somebody
or something

02:32.958 --> 02:35.583
trying to be the most
important thing in the world.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.083
No.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.958
Much as it might offend
their sense of perspective

02:40.042 --> 02:42.750
not everything is about
Babylon 5.

02:42.833 --> 02:45.250
[Lauren chuckles]

02:45.333 --> 02:47.417
Who-who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

02:47.500 --> 02:48.917
You can't, you can't hold me.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
You can't hide from me
too long. You can't hide.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.042
I told you it was my mind.
I told you it was my mind.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.250
You listen? You listen
to anything I told you.

02:54.333 --> 02:55.708
You don't listen,
you don't hear me

02:55.792 --> 02:57.708
yet you're telling me
the same thing again.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.083
[sobbing]

02:59.167 --> 03:00.917
My mind. My mind.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.833
My mind, not yours, my Freud.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.917
My mind.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.250
[chuckles]
'My mind.'

03:10.333 --> 03:12.167
Not yours.

03:21.708 --> 03:24.750
[intense music]

03:31.542 --> 03:33.125
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.458
There is a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

03:35.542 --> 03:38.042
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.917
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.083
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:42.167 --> 03:44.167
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld?

03:44.250 --> 03:46.625
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the star.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.208
(Sebestian)
Who are you?

03:48.292 --> 03:49.500
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

03:49.583 --> 03:50.958
a decree today, declaring--

03:51.042 --> 03:52.125
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us

03:52.208 --> 03:53.458
to declare independence.

03:53.542 --> 03:54.833
Unless your people
get off their

03:54.917 --> 03:56.375
encounter-suited butts
and do something.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.292
(male #1)
You're the one who was.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.667
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum
you will die.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.292
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:02.375 --> 04:04.167
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:04.250 --> 04:05.792
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.333
(Sheridan)
Like giants in the playground.

04:07.417 --> 04:08.583
Now get the hell
out of our galaxy!

04:08.667 --> 04:09.833
We are here to place

04:09.917 --> 04:11.708
President Clark under arrest.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.833
[theme music]

04:46.917 --> 04:48.750
[music continues]

04:59.958 --> 05:02.583
[instrumental music]

05:11.625 --> 05:14.667
[instrumental music]

05:21.667 --> 05:23.750
Are you sure
we should be in here?

05:23.833 --> 05:25.542
A Psi Corp learns
to ignore distractions

05:25.625 --> 05:27.083
and focus on the goal.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.875
In theory, you could bring
a brass band through here

05:28.958 --> 05:30.625
and they'd never know.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.958
What are they doing?

05:32.042 --> 05:33.708
Scan and countering exercises.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.375
One tries to scan the other,
who blocks.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.792
He has to hold off
his opponent

05:36.875 --> 05:38.583
for no less than five minutes.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.875
Then they switch places.

05:39.958 --> 05:42.417
'Over time,
we raise the minimum'

05:42.500 --> 05:44.167
ten minutes, fifteen..

05:44.250 --> 05:45.958
A field agent has to be
able to hold his own

05:46.042 --> 05:47.250
for at least an hour.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.750
Why an hour?

05:48.833 --> 05:50.250
Because unless you've gone
through training sessions

05:50.333 --> 05:53.708
like this, there isn't
a human telepath alive

05:53.792 --> 05:57.125
who can sustain a deep scan for
more than 40, 45 minutes tops.

05:58.708 --> 06:02.250
They burst arteries,
have strokes, black out.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.875
Would they mind if we watched?

06:03.958 --> 06:05.542
No, not at all. Go ahead.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.583
[shattering]

06:36.708 --> 06:38.917
That's terrible.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.708
How can they stand it?

06:40.792 --> 06:44.417
By constant exposure
and repetition.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.958
You'll get used to it.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.167
'That's the thing about
Level 12 investigations.'

06:59.250 --> 07:01.833
Being rated a P12 isn't enough.

07:01.917 --> 07:05.833
Only a certain kind of person
makes it to become a Psi Corp.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.333
Your job is to track down
rogue telepaths

07:08.417 --> 07:10.667
who will do anything
to avoid capture.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.333
If they can hurt you
or kill you, they will.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.875
If they can fry your synapses

07:14.958 --> 07:17.208
and turn you into vegetables,
they will.

07:17.292 --> 07:18.792
So you have to be ruthless.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.083
Only as a last resort.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.292
Remember, these are family.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.833
You have to care about
what you're doing

07:24.917 --> 07:26.167
and the people you're saving

07:26.250 --> 07:28.500
to go through what we just saw.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.542
When they finish
the training sessions

07:30.625 --> 07:32.167
they will have limited
the amount of harm

07:32.250 --> 07:35.500
a rogue can do them,
both mentally and physically.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.667
We make sure
they're in peak condition

07:37.750 --> 07:41.375
so they can go into the field
as well-protected as possible.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.375
Our mandate is to bring them
back alive and intact

07:44.458 --> 07:46.583
so we can help
put them back on track.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.375
Not that they appreciate it.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.333
That's where you're wrong.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.500
Sit.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.417
I think you'll find
this interesting.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.250
Begin program.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.417
[beeping]

08:09.625 --> 08:12.750
Hi. My name is Gordon.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.417
You may not think it
to look at me

08:14.500 --> 08:17.875
but six months ago,
I was a blip.

08:17.958 --> 08:21.792
I was hungry, tired, scared

08:21.875 --> 08:23.958
and I looked like this.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.000
Pretty scary, huh?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.083
But that's what happens
when you're on the run.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.958
I could barely stand on my own

08:31.042 --> 08:33.708
when the corps found me
and brought me home.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.958
Did you know that 42.5 percent
of all telepaths

08:37.042 --> 08:40.458
who leave the corps commit
suicide within nine months?

08:40.542 --> 08:41.792
'It's true.'

08:41.875 --> 08:43.750
'Without the support
of other telepaths'

08:43.833 --> 08:45.500
'thrown into a world
of mundanes..'

08:45.583 --> 08:47.083
End program.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.250
But it was just
getting interesting.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.500
We can pick it up later.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.333
There's, uh, been a problem.

08:57.042 --> 08:59.000
They won't give us
any information yet.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.875
Why don't you sit down
over here?

09:09.083 --> 09:11.875
[dramatic music]

09:14.125 --> 09:15.958
[indistinct chatter]

09:30.333 --> 09:31.792
Who found him?

09:31.875 --> 09:34.792
They were going to dinner before
attending the concert tonight.

09:41.167 --> 09:42.625
Cause of death?

09:42.708 --> 09:44.042
Blunt force trauma.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.250
We're not sure what he used yet.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.625
I'm sorry, Al.

09:47.708 --> 09:50.500
I know he was
a student of yours.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.542
We've closed off the campus

09:52.625 --> 09:55.833
but my guess is
he's long gone by now.

09:55.917 --> 09:57.333
You're sure it was the roommate?

09:57.417 --> 09:59.875
His friends say he's been
acting strange lately

09:59.958 --> 10:01.792
but they didn't think
much of it.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.500
Sometimes
the training does that.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.500
You just get over it.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.708
But this time
something went wrong.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.958
I'm assigning you
to the case, Al.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.625
Find him, bring him back.

10:14.708 --> 10:15.833
Why me?

10:15.917 --> 10:17.000
Because he's a P10

10:17.083 --> 10:18.542
and that makes him dangerous.

10:18.625 --> 10:21.500
And because
the victim was close to you

10:21.583 --> 10:24.125
I thought you'd
want to see justice done.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.167
I'll find him.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.375
[instrumental music]

10:37.042 --> 10:38.208
[sobbing]

10:38.292 --> 10:41.792
I know it doesn't feel
that way now..

10:43.167 --> 10:46.208
...but it will be alright.

10:46.292 --> 10:48.458
I'll make it alright.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.625
Would you please all
go back to your rooms?

11:03.625 --> 11:05.583
[knocking on door]

11:11.250 --> 11:13.625
I thought
you'd be at the concert.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.250
I-I was.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.167
I couldn't focus on the music.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.500
Uh, please. Come in.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.208
Sit down.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.125
I-I've never seen
a dead body before.

11:37.208 --> 11:41.458
Uh, not that close
and...not one of us.

11:43.708 --> 11:45.667
Do you get used to it?

11:45.750 --> 11:48.917
When it's one of ours? No.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
With mundanes, it's easier.

11:51.083 --> 11:54.167
They hate it when we say that,
but it's the truth.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.958
They kill, enslave,
and abuse each other

11:56.042 --> 11:58.792
with efficiency and enthusiasm.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.208
Why should we value
their lives when they don't?

12:02.292 --> 12:05.083
It's a little harder
with rogues and blips.

12:06.708 --> 12:09.792
Being a telepath
means you're special

12:09.875 --> 12:12.542
and rare and valuable.

12:14.208 --> 12:17.000
When they go out into the world,
run away from the corps

12:17.083 --> 12:19.625
it's easy to say
they deserve what they get.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.750
Even so..

12:24.458 --> 12:26.542
...it's not easy.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.042
But with someone like this

12:29.125 --> 12:30.667
an innocent

12:30.750 --> 12:34.167
someone with potential..

12:34.250 --> 12:38.000
No. You never get used to it.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.583
How did the corps find you?

12:41.833 --> 12:43.333
My parents were killed
in an accident

12:43.417 --> 12:45.250
I was barely a month old.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.083
When I was put into
a foster home

12:47.167 --> 12:50.333
I turned up
in the random DNA checks.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.333
The corps took me in, raised me

12:52.417 --> 12:55.083
and taught me that
because we're special.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.667
We need to watch out
for each other

12:56.750 --> 13:00.917
even more than we would as...
mundanes.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
We're responsible
for each other.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.917
I-I was told you were married.
Is she..

13:09.000 --> 13:12.250
No. No. We have a residence
in Syria Planum.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.458
She stays there
most of the time.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.708
I see her when I can.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.333
It must be nice.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.833
Someone who will wait for you..

13:22.917 --> 13:25.125
...someone who will love you.

13:25.208 --> 13:28.375
And if my wife
ever found out about her..

13:28.458 --> 13:29.833
[chuckles]

13:29.917 --> 13:31.542
Private joke.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.208
Look, it's getting late.

13:33.292 --> 13:34.875
You should go back to your room.

13:34.958 --> 13:36.542
Oh, yes.

13:41.042 --> 13:42.958
Um..

13:43.042 --> 13:45.292
...or I could stay here.

13:47.958 --> 13:51.958
Lauren, you're a very
sweet young woman.

13:52.042 --> 13:55.292
But my heart is already taken.

13:56.417 --> 13:57.875
She's not..

13:59.333 --> 14:01.250
She's not here right now.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.458
But I hope she will be someday.

14:07.167 --> 14:10.417
Now, if that changes

14:10.500 --> 14:12.375
you'll be the first to know.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.250
But for now

14:15.333 --> 14:18.417
I think you should
go back to your room.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.917
And don't worry
about this tomorrow.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.917
You shouldn't be embarrassed
about anything that happened

14:23.000 --> 14:24.542
because nothing did happen.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.417
- Alright?
- Alright.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.125
Thank you.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.917
[knock on door]

14:38.000 --> 14:40.292
I'm not changing my mind.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.042
Of course not.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.250
- You never do.
- Sorry.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.417
I, uh, I thought
you were somebody else.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.125
Obviously.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.125
Oh. I just thought
you should see this.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.708
The security log at Earthport 1
has our suspect booking passage

14:56.792 --> 14:58.667
on an outbound
commercial transport

14:58.750 --> 15:01.792
about an hour
after the time of death.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.125
Destination?

15:03.208 --> 15:06.292
Your favorite place
in the universe.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.167
Babylon 5.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.417
The suspect's name is
Jonathan Harris, age 23.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.917
He's rated a strong P10.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.917
He was being trained
in interrogation techniques

15:23.000 --> 15:25.667
when he killed his roommate
and fled the area.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.208
Any idea yet
what caused him to go off?

15:28.292 --> 15:30.792
Negative. We do know
he doesn't have much money

15:30.875 --> 15:32.333
so that limits his options.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.833
He apparently used most of it
to purchase a ticket

15:34.917 --> 15:37.042
for a commercial transport
bound for Babylon 5.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.500
On the other hand,
that may be an attempt

15:38.583 --> 15:40.333
to throw us off the track.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.458
'Just to be on the safe side,
Al, you and your team'

15:42.542 --> 15:45.292
'will proceed to Babylon 5.'

15:45.375 --> 15:47.042
'With luck, he'll get
stuck there for a while'

15:47.125 --> 15:49.667
'until he can raise enough money
to get a ticket elsewhere.'

15:49.750 --> 15:51.208
I want the rest of you to run

15:51.292 --> 15:53.042
full background checks
on Harris.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.000
Is there anywhere else he might
have gone? Who does he know?

15:56.083 --> 15:58.250
Has he been in contact with
anyone from the underground?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.458
Yes, Chen?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.208
If he boarded
a commercial transport

16:01.292 --> 16:02.708
why not just contact the ship

16:02.792 --> 16:04.375
and let their own
security force pick him up?

16:04.458 --> 16:06.250
Mundanes?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.083
Without sufficient training

16:08.167 --> 16:09.542
the average security patrol

16:09.625 --> 16:13.083
couldn't even handle a P8,
let alone a P10.

16:13.167 --> 16:16.208
He could make them look where
he isn't while he slips away.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.875
'Spark false
or misleading hunches.'

16:18.958 --> 16:20.375
'There are any number of tricks'

16:20.458 --> 16:23.292
'he could use on mundanes
to avoid being captured.'

16:23.375 --> 16:25.833
And by then
he'll know we're onto him

16:25.917 --> 16:27.208
and once he goes to ground

16:27.292 --> 16:29.750
we may never pick up
the scent again.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.375
Besides, this is an internal
Psi Corps problem.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.875
That means we deal with it
within the family.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.292
(Drake)
'The mundanes leave us alone'

16:36.375 --> 16:38.875
because we stay
out of the press.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.625
It's important
they continue to believe

16:40.708 --> 16:43.208
that nothing ever goes wrong
inside these walls.

16:43.292 --> 16:45.792
It's the only way to make sure
they leave us alone

16:45.875 --> 16:49.000
and don't start poking around
where they're not wanted.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.875
So, as Al said

16:50.958 --> 16:52.875
it's a family matter.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.250
Now, when can you get going?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.000
Our flight leaves in two hours.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.208
Good! The rest of you know
what to do. Get to it!

17:02.792 --> 17:05.000
[indistinct chatter]

17:05.083 --> 17:06.292
Al?

17:11.500 --> 17:13.208
I didn't want to say anything
in front of the others

17:13.292 --> 17:17.125
this whole situation
is problematic enough as it is.

17:17.208 --> 17:21.083
But the suspect was also
being trained in attack probes.

17:21.167 --> 17:24.167
He has a knack
for disrupting other telepaths.

17:25.167 --> 17:28.375
He is a mind shredder, Al.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.958
Let him get too close

17:31.042 --> 17:33.750
let him get a clear shot

17:33.833 --> 17:35.792
and he'll rip you in two.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.667
[instrumental music]

18:15.458 --> 18:18.500
[intense music]

18:42.750 --> 18:44.917
Why?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.583
Why did you do it?

18:47.667 --> 18:49.958
[laughs]

18:50.042 --> 18:53.167
Because I could.

18:53.250 --> 18:56.208
You know something went wrong

18:56.292 --> 18:59.542
but you don't know what

18:59.625 --> 19:03.042
and you never...will.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.208
[knock on door]

19:08.292 --> 19:09.625
Yes?

19:13.958 --> 19:15.375
I'm sorry, Mr. Bester.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.625
You said you wanted me
to remind you

19:16.708 --> 19:19.375
when we had to leave
for the Space Port.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.167
Yes. Of course.

19:22.958 --> 19:25.500
Thank you, Chen.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.042
I'll be right out.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.875
[instrumental music]

19:47.333 --> 19:49.417
[indistinct chatter]

20:02.917 --> 20:05.125
I'll call it.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.958
Damn it!

20:07.042 --> 20:09.125
[indistinct chatter]

20:19.875 --> 20:22.167
You in?

20:22.250 --> 20:23.625
Me?

20:23.708 --> 20:24.792
Oh! I'm sorry.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.125
[indistinct chatter]

20:27.208 --> 20:29.458
Uh, I never played
this game before.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.583
Can-can you tell me the rules?

20:33.667 --> 20:35.625
[chuckling]

20:35.708 --> 20:36.958
Sure.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.917
(man on radio)
'Shuttle one, we are within
range of transfer point.'

20:45.000 --> 20:46.917
'You're clear to depart.'

20:47.000 --> 20:49.083
Confirmed, control. Engines hot.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.917
(man on radio)
'Stand by.'

20:51.000 --> 20:53.292
Does the mothership
ever leave hyperspace?

20:53.375 --> 20:56.167
Only for repairs, when we can
do so without being seen.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.625
No reason for the rest
of the world to know

20:57.708 --> 20:59.583
what our resources are.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.708
The rest of the time it just
sits here in hyperspace

21:02.792 --> 21:04.375
for months at a time

21:04.458 --> 21:05.792
ferrying missions back and forth

21:05.875 --> 21:09.125
and waiting till we need it.

21:09.208 --> 21:10.708
Just like all the others.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.875
(man on radio)
'Shuttle one,
bay doors are open.'

21:12.958 --> 21:14.208
'You can proceed.'

21:14.292 --> 21:15.708
Roger that.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.833
[dramatic music]

21:31.917 --> 21:34.792
[indistinct chatter]

21:34.875 --> 21:36.167
Whoo!

21:36.250 --> 21:40.042
Well, it's been a real pleasure
doing business with you.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.333
Guess it wasn't quite
as hard as I heard.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.333
[chuckles]

21:46.417 --> 21:48.292
[indistinct chatter]

21:57.667 --> 21:59.542
(man on PA)
'May I have your attention,
please.'

21:59.625 --> 22:02.583
'Passengers transferring
from Starliner Asimov..'

22:02.667 --> 22:04.125
Don't you ever go away?

22:04.208 --> 22:06.375
Haven't you caused enough
trouble for one lifetime?

22:06.458 --> 22:08.750
It's a pleasure to see you
too, Mr. Allan.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.292
Where can I find
Captain Lochley?

22:10.375 --> 22:12.375
- I should check in with her.
- She's busy.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.458
You can check in with me. Card?

22:16.125 --> 22:18.292
So what is it this time,
Mr. Bester?

22:18.375 --> 22:20.125
Hunting down freedom fighters?

22:20.208 --> 22:23.583
Pulling wings off flies?
Annexing the Sudetenland?

22:23.667 --> 22:25.250
Tracking a murderer.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.750
We have full authorization

22:26.833 --> 22:28.917
to investigate, arrest
and bring him back to Earth

22:29.000 --> 22:31.750
along with any accomplices
or suspects.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.250
Murderer, huh? Who'd he kill?

22:34.333 --> 22:35.833
Another Psi Corp.

22:35.917 --> 22:37.625
Well, a Psi Corp in training.

22:37.708 --> 22:39.083
Oh.

22:39.167 --> 22:42.083
And this is bad because..

22:45.333 --> 22:47.083
[chuckles]

22:47.167 --> 22:49.167
What? W-w-what did he say?

22:49.250 --> 22:52.375
Nothing, Mr. Allan.
Nothing at all.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.042
This way.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.958
What did he say about the guard?

22:59.042 --> 23:01.958
Nothing. He said a joke.
A dirty joke.

23:02.042 --> 23:03.625
From the way you laughed,
he'll probably stay up all night

23:03.708 --> 23:05.125
wondering what we know
about his personal life.

23:05.208 --> 23:06.958
Exactly. And that is why

23:07.042 --> 23:08.458
at the end of the day

23:08.542 --> 23:11.750
the struggle between
mundanes and telepaths

23:11.833 --> 23:13.958
will be no struggle at all.

23:14.042 --> 23:16.167
Come on. We have work to do.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.750
Oh! I don't know
how you cheated back there.

23:22.833 --> 23:24.167
All I know is that you did.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.792
Now, you are going to
give me my money back

23:25.875 --> 23:27.250
all of it!

23:27.333 --> 23:28.667
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.000
I said, I want my money back!

23:33.708 --> 23:35.167
You shouldn't do that.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.208
That's a mistake.
That's a mistake.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.625
Don't want to get him upset.
You're gonna get him upset!

23:40.708 --> 23:42.125
[grunts]

23:42.208 --> 23:44.667
You're gonna get him upset.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.708
You shouldn't do that.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.125
You're gonna get him upset!

23:48.208 --> 23:50.333
I'll get you a hell of
a lot more than upset

23:50.417 --> 23:52.167
'you son of a..'

23:52.250 --> 23:54.083
[grunts]

23:59.417 --> 24:02.292
[intense music]

24:06.417 --> 24:08.250
[groaning]

24:15.667 --> 24:18.708
[screaming]

24:33.917 --> 24:36.500
[instrumental music]

24:52.292 --> 24:54.208
Did you find anything out
from the Drazi?

24:54.292 --> 24:55.958
He's a small-time fence.

24:56.042 --> 24:59.042
He buys stolen merchandise,
credit chits, identicards.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.333
Doesn't ask questions.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.083
A man matching
Harris' description

25:03.167 --> 25:04.500
came through here two days ago

25:04.583 --> 25:06.500
and sold off a few things

25:06.583 --> 25:10.250
enough to rent quarters here
for a little while.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.667
He pointed to a suite
up the hall

25:11.750 --> 25:14.208
but he was thinking
about that one.

25:14.292 --> 25:16.083
Probably he figured he'd
get away with half a truth

25:16.167 --> 25:17.583
and all the money.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.292
They never learn.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.292
Alright.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.792
Assuming that he hasn't
changed quarters

25:23.875 --> 25:27.500
in the last day or so,
our boy is in there.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.708
As a formality,
we need B5 security

25:29.792 --> 25:31.250
to open it up for us.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.458
I saw a BabCom unit
down the hall. I'll call it in.

25:33.542 --> 25:36.458
You two stay here,
keep an eye on the door.

25:36.542 --> 25:38.542
If he comes out, follow him.

25:38.625 --> 25:40.708
But don't try to take him down.

25:40.792 --> 25:43.750
Call in for backup.
I'll be here in a second.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.125
Understood.

25:54.042 --> 25:56.667
Chen! What-what the hell
are you doing?

25:56.750 --> 25:58.458
We used to use this
to get into the girls' wing

25:58.542 --> 25:59.500
back at the academy.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.958
You heard what he said.

26:01.042 --> 26:03.417
He said don't take him down.
I'm not.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.458
If we can get him while
he's still asleep or unguarded

26:05.542 --> 26:08.000
we'll have the benefit
of surprise. We can get..

26:10.750 --> 26:12.625
We can get the credit
for the arrest.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.375
You're disobeying instructions.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.125
I'm showing initiative.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.792
[beeping]

26:17.875 --> 26:19.708
[door opens]

26:22.167 --> 26:23.792
Back me up?

26:26.417 --> 26:29.333
[instrumental music]

26:38.000 --> 26:40.875
[intense music]

27:01.250 --> 27:02.500
Chen!

27:05.375 --> 27:08.083
[screaming]

27:10.167 --> 27:13.083
[indistinct chatter]

27:16.042 --> 27:17.542
Five hours from the time
you get here

27:17.625 --> 27:20.042
till the first dead body
shows up on the deck.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.708
- That's a record even for you.
- That's completely unfair!

27:22.792 --> 27:24.167
Can't you see
he's just trying to help?

27:24.250 --> 27:25.542
Lauren.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.875
The medtechs confirm
that the body's been lying here

27:27.958 --> 27:29.375
for over two days.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.250
He was dead before we got here.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.875
Yeah, they told me

27:32.958 --> 27:36.625
but I never let the facts
get in the way of a good grudge.

27:36.708 --> 27:39.208
The deceased
was a small-time gambler.

27:39.292 --> 27:41.750
We've seen him working
the casino from time to time.

27:41.833 --> 27:43.083
Finally got thrown out last week

27:43.167 --> 27:44.583
for counting cards
at the blackjack table.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.083
The thing is

27:46.167 --> 27:48.667
his identicard was used
several times after his death

27:48.750 --> 27:50.333
so it looks like your boy

27:50.417 --> 27:52.083
switched ID's with the dead guy

27:52.167 --> 27:54.000
and took whatever money he had.

27:54.083 --> 27:55.750
Thing is,
I can't see any connection

27:55.833 --> 27:58.750
between your target
and the deceased.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.208
So why did he pick him to kill?

28:01.292 --> 28:04.208
Probably just random chance.

28:04.292 --> 28:06.958
He was looking for
somebody with money.

28:07.042 --> 28:09.417
Where was the stolen
identicard being used?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.792
In the casino.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.625
Apparently he did
very well for himself

28:12.708 --> 28:14.917
at the blackjack table.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.250
Chief.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.083
I don't understand.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.417
Under Psi Corps rules, telepaths
aren't allowed to gamble.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.667
So when they do gamble,
they're not very good at it.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.667
I mean, it takes a lot
more than scanning.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.667
You have to know
what you're doing.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.583
So, why would he be able to win?

28:34.667 --> 28:38.625
Unless he suddenly acquired
a skill for cheating.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.375
Harris must have
ripped it out of his mind

28:42.458 --> 28:43.792
just before killing him.

28:43.875 --> 28:46.208
That's why he chose this victim.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.958
He's acquiring whatever skills

28:48.042 --> 28:50.625
he thinks will help him
raise money fast

28:50.708 --> 28:52.833
so that he can get away.

28:52.917 --> 28:55.458
Well, Mr. Bester,
you're now two for two.

28:55.542 --> 28:58.125
We just had another dead body
show up in Medlab 1.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.417
How do you know
our suspect is responsible?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.083
Just a hunch.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.667
[indistinct chatter]

29:15.750 --> 29:17.708
Well, as near as I can tell,
it looks as if

29:17.792 --> 29:21.500
half his brain cells
just erupted from the inside.

29:21.583 --> 29:23.667
Simultaneous aneurysms

29:23.750 --> 29:26.708
cerebral hemorrhages,
blood clots.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.000
He was murdered
from the inside out.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.000
Since there are no marks
on the outside

29:31.083 --> 29:32.583
and no sign of trauma

29:32.667 --> 29:34.167
no history
of this sort of problem

29:34.250 --> 29:36.167
it's a safe bet that, uh

29:36.250 --> 29:37.750
this was done by your suspect.

29:37.833 --> 29:40.042
Yes, you'd think that,
wouldn't you?

29:40.125 --> 29:42.042
Yeah. Wouldn't you?

29:42.125 --> 29:44.583
Our suspect is a P10.

29:44.667 --> 29:48.000
This kind of damage
can only be done by a P12.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.833
Are you sure?

29:49.917 --> 29:51.833
Well, I-I just mean, you know

29:51.917 --> 29:54.625
maybe you made a mistake
with-with your tests.

29:54.708 --> 29:57.417
Maybe he's higher than a P10
and you've just missed it.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.667
No, we don't make
those kinds of mistakes.

30:05.042 --> 30:07.208
I see.

30:07.292 --> 30:09.292
I very much doubt that.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.333
This could be bad.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.208
This could be very bad.

30:21.292 --> 30:22.917
What is it? What's wrong?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.083
I don't wanna say anything
until I have more information.

30:26.167 --> 30:28.750
Lauren, I want you
to get on the line

30:28.833 --> 30:30.250
with the main office.

30:30.333 --> 30:33.417
Have them copy me on everything
they found in Harris' room.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.250
Papers, notes,
personal journals, anything.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.667
What are we looking for?

30:37.750 --> 30:40.625
I don't know.
But I'll know it when I see it.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.208
Now get going.

30:45.167 --> 30:48.417
Our target is too smart to
stay in one place for very long

30:48.500 --> 30:51.083
so I doubt we'll find him
near the casino.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.750
But there are about
a half a dozen other places

30:52.833 --> 30:55.500
on Babylon 5
where gambling is allowed.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.250
I need you to check them out.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.625
See if anyone's had
any contact with him.

30:59.708 --> 31:01.083
And if I run into him?

31:01.167 --> 31:03.417
Stay clear until I get there.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.917
Do not attempt any contact.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.792
I mean it this time, Chen.

31:07.875 --> 31:11.250
Harris may be even more
dangerous than we believed.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.167
I'm gonna check with customs.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.542
Make sure
he didn't use that money

31:14.625 --> 31:16.667
to book passage off the station.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.708
[instrumental music]

31:26.792 --> 31:29.708
[indistinct chatter]

32:00.875 --> 32:03.958
Sorry, kid, no service here.
I got a license to look after.

32:04.042 --> 32:05.833
It's alright.
I don't want anything.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.167
I'm looking for someone.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.000
I was wondering
if you might've seen him.

32:09.083 --> 32:11.000
I've seen all kinds, kid.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.667
Seen an alien
come through here last week

32:12.750 --> 32:15.250
with eight compound eyes
and a glass stomach.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.708
Two fingers of gin, he's down

32:16.792 --> 32:19.500
completely unconscious
for a full two hours

32:19.583 --> 32:21.333
then he wants to do it again.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.417
I've seen
a naked Pak'ma'ra once.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.833
You know that hump
on their back?

32:25.917 --> 32:27.833
That's not a hump at all.
That's their--

32:27.917 --> 32:30.375
Thank you.
Uh, I think I have what I need.

32:30.458 --> 32:33.542
[indistinct chatter]

32:44.542 --> 32:45.917
[automated voice]
'Do you wish to place a call?'

32:46.000 --> 32:47.542
Yes. Uh, uh, Temporary Residence

32:47.625 --> 32:50.083
Red 3, Unit 7, Bester, Al.

32:50.167 --> 32:51.750
[automated voice]
'Stand by.'

32:54.792 --> 32:56.042
[grunts]

33:07.083 --> 33:09.000
- 'How did he die?'
- Stab wound to the heart.

33:11.125 --> 33:14.708
Look, I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.333
He was just a kid.

33:16.417 --> 33:19.625
Save your sympathy
for someone else, Mr. Allan.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.750
Of all the things in life
I could drown in

33:21.833 --> 33:25.250
love, music, the eyes of another

33:25.333 --> 33:28.208
crocodile tears
are the least appealing.

33:28.292 --> 33:30.250
Go on.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.917
Well, there weren't
any witnesses to what happened

33:33.000 --> 33:35.125
at least none
that have come forward.

33:35.208 --> 33:38.375
We got one thing to go on
and it's not much.

33:38.458 --> 33:41.542
'Just before he died,
he tried to call you.'

33:41.625 --> 33:43.208
'He didn't get very far.'

33:43.292 --> 33:46.292
The BabCom unit
started to record his message

33:46.375 --> 33:50.125
then put it on pause
when he didn't finish.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.958
'Freeze.
Back it up frame by frame.'

33:54.417 --> 33:55.667
'Stop.'

33:55.750 --> 33:56.917
'That's your perp.'

33:57.000 --> 34:00.750
'We're trying to ID
that tattoo right now.'

34:00.833 --> 34:02.292
That's not Harris.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.958
Well, okay.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.875
But if that's true..

34:08.542 --> 34:10.292
...who stabbed him?

34:10.375 --> 34:13.667
Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.458
That's my ten percent.

34:15.542 --> 34:18.167
You wanna count it and
make sure I didn't cheat you?

34:18.250 --> 34:19.958
Unnecessary.

34:20.042 --> 34:21.167
If you were gonna cheat

34:21.250 --> 34:23.333
I would know it
and you'd be dead.

34:23.417 --> 34:26.250
Now, what kind of way is that
to talk to your partner?

34:26.333 --> 34:28.333
I'm here to look after you.

34:28.417 --> 34:31.375
I knew we were made for
each other the minute I saw you.

34:31.458 --> 34:34.167
Between your gift
and my contacts

34:34.250 --> 34:35.500
we're gonna clean up.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.375
I just need enough to get away.

34:37.458 --> 34:38.667
Far away.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.125
Another 200 credits
and we'll have enough

34:40.208 --> 34:41.792
to go all the way
to Proximal and back.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.083
The and back part
is unimportant.

34:44.167 --> 34:46.667
Yeah. I kinda noticed that.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.500
Can I, uh, ask you, uh

34:49.583 --> 34:51.417
what are you running from?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.208
I don't know.

34:55.292 --> 34:58.708
Come on, you can tell
your old buddy, Bryce.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.333
They're looking for you.
You must have done something.

35:01.417 --> 35:03.250
I told you, I don't know!

35:04.958 --> 35:08.208
I don't know what happened.
I'm not even sure why I'm here.

35:08.292 --> 35:11.833
One minute, I was
in the testing center

35:11.917 --> 35:13.667
and the next..

35:15.583 --> 35:17.750
...I don't remember.

35:17.833 --> 35:19.833
I'm not supposed to remember.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.958
All I know is I can't go back.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.542
You told me
there was another place

35:26.625 --> 35:28.583
we can go to get
the rest of the money.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.042
There is indeed.

35:33.833 --> 35:35.500
Anything yet?

35:35.583 --> 35:37.208
No, nothing.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.167
Are you sure
these are from the same file?

35:41.250 --> 35:44.917
They said those were
all of Harris' papers. Why?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.250
There's a lot in here
that's in different handwriting

35:47.333 --> 35:48.917
different names.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.708
As if they'd either
mixed two files together

35:50.792 --> 35:53.458
or somebody else
had access to his papers.

35:53.542 --> 35:57.250
Maybe one of those names
is the guy with the tattoo.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.458
Could be, or..

35:58.542 --> 36:01.208
Hey, hey, hey,
I've got something.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.375
Here.

36:02.458 --> 36:03.917
[beep]

36:04.000 --> 36:06.333
This is the last video record
they had.

36:06.417 --> 36:07.792
It's an off-hours
training session

36:07.875 --> 36:09.917
between Harris and his roommate.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.125
Play.

36:12.708 --> 36:15.417
If only there was some way we
could record thought patterns.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.458
We'd know what was going on.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.500
- Give us time.
- Oh!

36:21.875 --> 36:23.750
Jon, are you okay?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.875
What was that?

36:25.958 --> 36:27.958
It's okay. It's okay.

36:28.042 --> 36:30.125
If I went too far, I'm sorry.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.208
Just let it go, okay?

36:32.292 --> 36:33.833
If I've done anything
to upset you..

36:33.917 --> 36:37.208
He said, "Let it go!"

36:39.708 --> 36:41.250
Back it up.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.750
There. Play it.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.417
If I've done anything
to upset you..

36:46.500 --> 36:50.208
He said, "Let it go!"

36:50.292 --> 36:51.375
Again.

36:52.708 --> 36:56.125
He said, "Let it go!"

37:02.042 --> 37:04.083
"He said, let it go."

37:06.875 --> 37:08.458
Not I said.

37:10.042 --> 37:11.625
He said.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.750
What? What is it?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.583
These papers.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.667
'Different styles of
handwriting, different names'

37:19.750 --> 37:23.167
but not different people.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.750
The same person

37:25.833 --> 37:28.250
with multiple personalities.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.875
'That's why we misidentified
his rating.'

37:30.958 --> 37:32.667
One personality was a P10.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.458
The other was a P12.

37:35.542 --> 37:38.167
It's rare,
but it has happened before.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.667
The same way one personality
can be an artist

37:40.750 --> 37:42.875
and the other can't draw
a straight line.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.333
Something
in the training session

37:44.417 --> 37:46.375
we saw must have triggered it.

37:46.458 --> 37:49.417
And his roommate saw
one of the other personalities.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.167
That's why he was killed.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.083
One of those personalities
murdered him to keep the secret.

37:54.167 --> 37:56.167
Because unstable telepaths

37:56.250 --> 37:58.583
are put away
for the good of everyone.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.833
Check these names
against the station manifest.

38:00.917 --> 38:04.042
See if he checked in under
one of his other personalities.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.833
Go on. Hurry!

38:06.708 --> 38:08.125
[door opens]

38:09.958 --> 38:11.375
[door closes]

38:21.375 --> 38:22.458
Freeze!

38:22.542 --> 38:23.625
[gunshots]

38:23.708 --> 38:24.875
Hold it!

38:24.958 --> 38:26.500
Get down! Get down!

38:27.875 --> 38:29.583
(Harris)
'Watch out!'

38:29.667 --> 38:30.625
Harris.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.875
[gunshot]

38:31.958 --> 38:34.333
- 'Hold your fire!'
- Listen to me.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.208
We know about your situation.

38:36.292 --> 38:38.750
We know what your roommate
discovered. It's okay.

38:38.833 --> 38:41.375
We can help you.
But you have to trust us.

38:41.458 --> 38:42.792
Let us take you back with us.

38:42.875 --> 38:45.167
No! I won't go back!

38:45.250 --> 38:47.875
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

38:49.417 --> 38:51.208
- Down!
- 'Take him down!'

38:51.292 --> 38:52.833
[grunting]

38:53.833 --> 38:56.167
Harris! Back me up!

38:56.250 --> 38:58.375
Harris!

38:58.458 --> 39:00.500
Oh. I didn't do anything.

39:03.042 --> 39:06.083
The dark man
and the laughing man

39:06.167 --> 39:07.875
and me and Harris..

39:09.000 --> 39:11.167
...we're all in this together.

39:11.250 --> 39:14.333
It's nobody's fault, really.
It's nobody's fault.

39:14.417 --> 39:17.417
- 'Get him out of here.'
- 'Come on, let's go. Get him.'

39:17.500 --> 39:20.000
We all did it.
You have to understand. Please.

39:20.083 --> 39:22.375
- Don't hurt him.
- 'They made us do this.'

39:22.458 --> 39:26.417
Just...don't hurt him.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.583
(Franklin)
'You know, I don't think
you should leave so early.'

39:32.667 --> 39:35.417
That PPG burn's
going to take a while to heal.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.917
Oh, come on, doctor,
we have history here.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.625
Tell the truth.

39:39.708 --> 39:42.208
You don't want me here a second
more than I wanna be here.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.333
Personally, no.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.292
But as a doctor, I have to, uh,
treat all my patients equally.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.625
Even the annoying,
self-righteous, arrogant ones

39:51.708 --> 39:53.833
with self-important
delusions of Godhood.

39:53.917 --> 39:56.125
Ah. Thank you.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.958
I feel far more at home now.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.292
[grunts]

40:03.083 --> 40:06.417
One of the drawbacks
of instinct.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.375
If you'd had a chance
to think about it

40:08.458 --> 40:10.542
you would have been content
to let me fall.

40:10.625 --> 40:11.792
No, that's not true.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.417
- No?
- No.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.917
Care to scan me to find out?
I'll authorize it.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.958
Or would you rather go on
believing that our kind

40:19.042 --> 40:22.500
and your kind have to hate
each other, no compromises?

40:24.750 --> 40:27.292
You're an optimist. Thank you.

40:27.375 --> 40:30.833
I'd almost forgotten what
one of your kind looked like.

40:30.917 --> 40:33.333
Ah, Lauren. Good.

40:33.417 --> 40:36.083
The doctor here
was just clearing me to leave.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.500
Is the shuttle fueled up?

40:37.583 --> 40:40.292
- She's ready to go.
- What about the prisoners?

40:40.375 --> 40:41.750
With a little nudge
from back home

40:41.833 --> 40:44.167
security's agreed
to recognize our authority

40:44.250 --> 40:46.625
and turn them both
over to our custody.

40:46.708 --> 40:50.000
They'll be sedated to make
the transfer easier.

40:50.083 --> 40:52.583
Frankly, I think Mr. Allan will
be just as happy to let them go

40:52.667 --> 40:56.000
since that means
we'll be out of here ASAP.

40:56.083 --> 40:58.500
He doesn't like our kind.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.208
Well, no.
How do you know that?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.167
(Lauren)
'He said so.'

41:04.833 --> 41:06.375
Game..

41:06.458 --> 41:08.042
...set..

41:08.125 --> 41:09.042
...match.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.625
[chuckles]

41:10.708 --> 41:12.375
Be seeing you, doctor.

41:12.458 --> 41:15.375
[instrumental music]

41:29.542 --> 41:32.708
When we get back,
you deserve a back rub.

41:35.375 --> 41:37.583
You don't have to do that.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.667
I know.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.167
I want to.

41:43.875 --> 41:46.833
You know, Chen thought
you were a hero.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.250
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure

41:48.333 --> 41:50.917
if I still believed in heroes.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.333
But I have never seen anyone
fight for our people

41:53.417 --> 41:54.875
the way you do.

41:56.042 --> 41:57.958
You don't let go, do you?

41:59.958 --> 42:01.750
No.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.458
I'll tell you the truth, Lauren.

42:04.542 --> 42:07.000
There are some days when I think
that's a good thing..

42:08.333 --> 42:10.667
...and other days
I'm not so sure.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.417
I am.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.792
ETA with the mothership?

42:17.875 --> 42:19.250
Six hours, twenty minutes.

42:19.333 --> 42:20.833
Ah.

42:20.917 --> 42:23.000
That's a long haul.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.833
And we still
have the mundane to deal with.

42:28.250 --> 42:29.750
That's true.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.375
Let me?

42:35.167 --> 42:37.000
Please?

42:37.083 --> 42:38.583
Are you sure?

42:43.875 --> 42:46.833
Alright. Go on.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.667
Your first?

43:08.750 --> 43:11.167
My first.

43:11.250 --> 43:14.125
Well, you made it
past the first stage.

43:14.208 --> 43:16.833
You just might be Psi Corps
material after all.

43:20.625 --> 43:22.542
Now let's go home.

43:32.625 --> 43:35.000
