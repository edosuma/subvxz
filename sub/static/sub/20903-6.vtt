00:04.025 --> 00:06.780
- Previously on <i>Stitchers</i>...
- Why do you like me?

00:06.810 --> 00:10.090
Are you deliberately
trying to sabotage this?

00:10.110 --> 00:13.420
I really think you are
worth taking a shot on.

00:13.450 --> 00:15.460
I don't want to be anyone's shot.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.710
You know, sometimes you can
be a little bit of a bully.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.100
Well, sometimes you can be
a little bit of a stupid.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.660
- So, what's up?
- Ivy. Things were going great,

00:23.690 --> 00:25.900
then all of a sudden, she
started ghosting me.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.910
Stay close to Linus. Make him trust you.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.650
Help us find out where Jacqueline is.

00:32.670 --> 00:33.690
Cameron: <i>Do you know how hard it is</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:35.010
for Kirsten to keep seeing
her mother like that?

00:35.030 --> 00:39.450
And where, exactly, does Kirsten see
Jacqueline Stinger "cooped up"?

00:39.480 --> 00:40.960
Kirsten: <i>She's gone. Her chamber...
the computers,</i>

00:40.980 --> 00:42.760
<i>the monitors... everything.
Stinger must have found her.</i>

00:42.780 --> 00:44.610
Calm down, okay? It wasn't Stinger.

00:44.630 --> 00:46.390
- How could you betray me?
- I didn't mean to.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.210
I just... Can be please talk?
Where you going?

00:48.240 --> 00:49.490
Kirsten: <i>To be with
someone that I trust.</i>

00:49.520 --> 00:52.040
(sobbing)

00:53.290 --> 00:55.930
- (birds chirping)
- (knocks on door)

00:55.960 --> 00:58.120
Kirsten: Camille, are you awake?

00:58.150 --> 01:00.530
- Unfortunately.
- Kirsten: Are you alone?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.330
Also unfortunately.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.250
(grunts)

01:06.130 --> 01:08.090
(sighs)

01:08.360 --> 01:10.250
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.550
I shouldn't have jumped
on you like that.

01:11.570 --> 01:14.640
I was having a... real bad day.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.530
Thanks. Sorry I called you a bully.

01:17.550 --> 01:20.760
(chuckles) That particular shoe fit.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.660
- Cameron screwed me.
- (scoffs) It's about time.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.430
No, I mean he betrayed me...

01:25.460 --> 01:27.260
with Maggie.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.250
Now that's impressive. She's
completely out of his league.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.320
No, I...

01:32.680 --> 01:36.020
He told her something that I'd
shared with him in confidence.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.360
My mother's location.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.790
Uh, hold on. What? You
know where your mother is

01:42.820 --> 01:45.260
and didn't try to tell me about it?

01:45.290 --> 01:48.170
To protect you. Anyone who knows
where to find her is a target.

01:48.190 --> 01:51.240
Well, uh, thanks, I guess. (Scoffs)

01:51.460 --> 01:53.200
Cameron was the only person I told,

01:53.220 --> 01:56.020
but then he told Maggie,
and she had her moved...

01:56.900 --> 01:59.900
again, so now I've lost her again.

01:59.930 --> 02:02.500
Okay, uh, I'd say the first
thing you need to do

02:02.520 --> 02:03.930
is break your foot off in Cameron's ass.

02:03.950 --> 02:05.620
I did that already. It wasn't pretty.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.780
And second, you need to
put the screws to Maggie,

02:07.800 --> 02:10.570
get her to tell you where
she moved your mother.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.810
And third, you need to break
your foot off in Cameron's ass.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.240
I thought that was the first.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.300
- You got two feet, girl.
- Mmm.

02:18.410 --> 02:21.530
- Where's Amanda?
- (sighs)

02:25.560 --> 02:28.560
- (rock music playing)
- (gun firing in video game)

02:28.590 --> 02:30.830
So, Maggie moved Kirsten's mother?

02:31.050 --> 02:33.410
It's not like I knew what she was
going to do with that information.

02:33.430 --> 02:35.670
She ordered me to tell her. I had to.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.450
Of course. Otherwise, she'd shoot you.

02:37.470 --> 02:38.740
- (Cameron scoffs)
- However...

02:40.230 --> 02:42.560
- There's a "however"?
- you did violate her trust,

02:42.590 --> 02:45.010
- and that's big.
- (sighs)

02:45.030 --> 02:47.630
- Did you start the apology tour yet?
- No, I've tried.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.590
Well, try harder. Say nice things,

02:50.780 --> 02:53.730
- do nice things. Just be...
- Nice?

02:55.460 --> 02:57.920
- So, how are you and Ivy?
- Man, I don't know.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.810
She's acting strange.

02:59.850 --> 03:02.430
There's something going on with
her, but I don't know what.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.990
As they say, women are from
Venus, and men are from Mars.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.850
- We're back to not knocking?
- Where's my mother?

04:05.060 --> 04:08.270
- The less you know, the better.
- I think that's up to me to decide.

04:08.340 --> 04:10.160
It's not. Our mission stays the same.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.020
You keep stitching, we
keep mapping the brain

04:12.050 --> 04:14.350
until we have what we need
to get to the other side.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.220
I get to decide how my story ends.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.490
- No one else.
- Kirsten, wait.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.329
Kirsten: Not for you.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.390
She'll come around,
just give her time.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.550
You did the right thing.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.400
Jake Rowland, 35,

04:26.430 --> 04:27.900
an engineer at AVR,

04:27.920 --> 04:29.890
the Aero Velocity Research Institute.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.610
He was found shot

04:31.640 --> 04:33.030
in the Mars simulation chamber.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.430
AVR? That place is a
fortress of awesome.

04:35.450 --> 04:36.950
What does that even mean?

04:36.970 --> 04:40.160
It means they're doing some really
ground-breaking stuff there.

04:40.190 --> 04:42.190
They want to put people on Mars by 2025.

04:42.210 --> 04:42.810
(cell phone buzzes)

04:42.840 --> 04:44.600
Maggie: AVR has high-level
military contracts,

04:44.630 --> 04:45.800
and there is a concern

04:45.830 --> 04:47.070
that Jake Rowland's murder- -

04:47.090 --> 04:49.050
was an attempt to get
classified information.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.180
- Any security cameras?
- Maggie: All over the place,

04:51.210 --> 04:53.310
but the ones in and
around the Mars simulator

04:53.340 --> 04:54.980
were shut down when Jake was shot,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.580
so we don't have much to go on.

04:56.610 --> 04:59.460
Not until Kirsten stitches in
and tells us what Jake saw...

05:00.370 --> 05:03.810
because we know how awesome
she is at doing that.

05:04.350 --> 05:06.290
(whispers) That's nice, Cameron.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.340
Seriously?

05:08.290 --> 05:11.470
Well, this was fun. (Chuckles)

05:17.600 --> 05:20.020
- What's everyone's problem?
- Millennials.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.020
Hey. You okay?

05:24.530 --> 05:27.420
- Girl problems.
- Me too.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.400
(sarcastically) Oh, look, we're twins.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.070
We're all going through stuff.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.740
I could use a friend, I
was thinking maybe you,

05:33.770 --> 05:34.890
but clearly not.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.080
Sorry. (Sighs)

05:37.220 --> 05:40.080
Did you, um, hear back from Ivy yet?

05:40.680 --> 05:43.420
She wants to get together later, talk.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.540
Well, clarity's good.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.800
Maybe she'll explain herself... finally.

05:48.430 --> 05:50.920
Com check... one, two, one, two.
Can you hear me, Buzz?

05:50.950 --> 05:51.770
Is that an astronaut reference

05:51.800 --> 05:53.580
or a <i> Toy Story</i> reference?

05:53.610 --> 05:55.980
Let's just... (sighs) do this.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.780
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

05:57.810 --> 06:00.960
In three, two, one... blast off.

06:00.990 --> 06:04.230
(whirring)

06:04.770 --> 06:06.330
You really screwed me on this.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.970
Come on. You can fix this.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.110
I don't know how. Just
tell me what you did.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.470
You know I can't do that.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.530
Kirsten: Jake's arguing with someone.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.260
Sounds like he deliberately messed
up something they were working on.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.300
Any ID on the guy?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.350
No. Wait, I'm being
pulled somewhere else.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.370
- (video game noises)
- People are cheering.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.320
- (people cheering, shouting)
- (loud rock music playing)

06:25.350 --> 06:29.810
Some kind of... sports
event or a game I think.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.840
- Do you know where you are?
- No, I can't tell.

06:33.870 --> 06:36.250
It's dark, noisy.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.360
There's a sign hanging
on the wall with a bee

06:42.390 --> 06:44.620
and a lightning bolt logo on it,

06:44.640 --> 06:46.530
"auto parts" written underneath.

06:46.550 --> 06:49.450
Lightning bolt plus bee,
"auto parts." Checking.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.240
To think I used to love you.

06:52.850 --> 06:54.670
Jake: Hey, Zelda, where you going?

06:54.690 --> 06:57.230
He's having some problems
with a girl named Zelda.

06:57.260 --> 06:59.180
She's on the move again.

07:00.510 --> 07:04.410
Looks like Jake got into a fight.
He's got a black eye.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.430
Maybe you're just projecting your
feelings about me onto Jake.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.360
Impossible. He only has one black eye.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.080
Camille: Oh, and at the
end of this round,

07:11.100 --> 07:13.630
it's leggy blonde one, uber-nerd zero.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.340
(whirring)

07:16.560 --> 07:21.490
Kirsten: Back at AVR. Jake's
playing a video game,

07:21.520 --> 07:23.350
and he's at a desk somewhere.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.340
He gets to play games at work?

07:25.370 --> 07:27.160
No wonder it's taking us
so long to get to Mars.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.940
(gunshots)

07:28.970 --> 07:32.690
- (car engine revs)
- (tires squeal)

07:33.760 --> 07:35.660
Kirsten: Jake was shot
while leaving work.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.410
The shooter just drove off.

07:42.140 --> 07:44.800
- He's dying.
- (heart beating)

07:44.830 --> 07:47.210
Trying to get to a desk?

07:47.270 --> 07:49.520
Police report said a bullet
hit Jake's cell phone.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.130
Maybe he was trying to
get to another phone?

07:51.150 --> 07:53.270
Was he trying to get to a phone?

07:59.100 --> 08:01.230
I don't know, but he's writing
something in the sand.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.210
Can she see who it is?
The name of the killer?

08:03.230 --> 08:03.920
What's he writing?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.420
- (alarm beeps)
- Death moment in three seconds.

08:05.450 --> 08:07.100
Make the bounce.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.730
(beeping)

08:09.760 --> 08:12.570
(whirring down)

08:14.530 --> 08:16.370
Did you see what Jake wrote in the sand?

08:16.390 --> 08:17.270
- No.
- Camille.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.210
Yeah, crime scene photos.
Way ahead of you,

08:19.230 --> 08:20.490
- but you're not gonna like this.
- (beeps)

08:20.510 --> 08:22.580
Blood and sand do not mix.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.650
Kirsten, go to AVR, see
what you can find out.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.730
Take Cameron with you.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.160
Oh, actually, Fisher's
an outer space buff.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.090
- Aren't you, Fish?
- I don't even like Mars bars.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.210
Perfect. I'll go get changed.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.250
Okay, I guess I'll go get the car.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.419
- You don't like Mars bars?
- Fisher: Nah.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.610
Maggie.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.059
Look, I know you said
this will all blow over,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.670
but I'm telling you, I know Kirsten.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.330
It won't. She's at an
emotional simmer right now.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.400
She's steady, but at any
point, she could boil over.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.040
You have to tell her
where her mother is.

08:51.060 --> 08:51.510
No.

08:51.530 --> 08:55.240
- Okay, maybe I wasn't being clear.
- Maybe I'm not being clear.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.830
No matter how much you whine and moan,

08:56.850 --> 08:59.950
I will never knowingly put
any of you in danger.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.950
We good?

09:04.950 --> 09:07.290
Ivy: <i>I know I owe you an explanation.</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:12.630
I'm really not as flaky as
I'm sure you think I am.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.580
If you tell me that you think
we're not good together

09:15.600 --> 09:17.890
or we were moving too fast,
you know, I would get that.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.340
- You're right.
- Look, even a simple "sorry."

09:20.370 --> 09:22.030
You know, "Linus, you're awesome",

09:22.050 --> 09:24.500
"but I just don't see us
happening," that would do.

09:24.770 --> 09:27.680
I wouldn't be happy,
but at least I'd know.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.350
Yeah, I pretty much had
planned to say just that.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.980
But now that I'm with you...

09:36.240 --> 09:38.320
I can't do it.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.320
(sighs)

09:42.410 --> 09:43.800
Linus...

09:45.930 --> 09:49.000
you are so awesome.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.670
I really do see us happening.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.670
I really want to believe you right now,

09:54.690 --> 09:57.340
but I don't think I can.
I mean, how can I tr...

10:04.110 --> 10:06.260
- (sighs)
- That's a good start.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.600
(chuckles)

10:11.690 --> 10:15.150
So, how long is you and Cameron
not talking going to be a thing?

10:15.270 --> 10:17.820
Keep out of this one, Detective Fishy.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.630
Whatever you say, Agent Clark.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.420
You must be the agents from the NSA.

10:21.450 --> 10:24.580
- I'm Mark Fleming.
- Mr. Fleming, this is Agent Clark, NSA.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.030
I'm Detective Fisher, LAPD.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.990
We're very sorry to hear
about Jake Rowland.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.050
We're all devastated about Jake,

10:30.150 --> 10:33.720
but his death brought with it a
very unanticipated consequence.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.550
More unanticipated than his murder?

10:35.580 --> 10:38.470
Before Jake died, he took our Mars
communication satellite off-line.

10:38.490 --> 10:41.490
- (hesitantly) That sounds bad.
- Worse than you can imagine.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.520
If we can't get that satellite
back on-line, we can't control it,

10:44.540 --> 10:46.300
meaning we can't steer
it away from space junk,

10:46.320 --> 10:47.700
and if it collides with something,

10:47.730 --> 10:49.240
it will come crashing down to Earth.

10:49.260 --> 10:50.560
Is the government aware of this?

10:50.580 --> 10:53.300
Yes, but their solution is for
us to trigger a self-destruct

10:53.330 --> 10:55.550
before the satellite hits its
zero barrier in 48 hours.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.580
That's how much time we
have to figure this out.

10:57.610 --> 10:58.930
Well, maybe we can help.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.440
- NSA? How's that gonna happen?
- We're more than just a pretty face.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.110
Sure.

11:11.590 --> 11:13.610
(door opens)

11:14.320 --> 11:16.550
- (people chattering)
- Was Jake unhappy here?

11:16.790 --> 11:18.700
Why do you think he would
sabotage the satellite?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.650
Mark: Well, sabotage was
what he was paid to do.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.490
Fisher: I'm sorry?

11:21.530 --> 11:23.860
Jake was our Mars project gremlin.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.990
His job was to creatively and
deliberately screw with our simulator

11:27.010 --> 11:28.360
so that the rest of our team

11:28.390 --> 11:30.000
could know how to deal
with the unexpected.

11:30.030 --> 11:33.090
I've heard of this. Some companies
hire both a gremlin and a fixer.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.580
Right. He would come in after hours

11:34.600 --> 11:36.960
and work up tests and challenges
for our fixer to solve.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.720
If the fixer could solve them, great.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.090
If not, Jake would tell
the fixer what he did,

11:41.120 --> 11:42.900
and both of them would
work up a solution.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.670
- Who's your fixer?
- An engineer named Kenny Lee.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.020
He and Jake had quite the rivalry going.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.860
Things sometimes got pretty
intense between them.

11:49.890 --> 11:52.450
So, even though it was
Jake's job to sabotage,

11:52.480 --> 11:55.210
you still can't figure out why he
would mess with an actual satellite?

11:55.240 --> 11:58.700
Exactly, but how he did it
is the problem at hand.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.620
Whatever Jake did to the
satellite was brilliant.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.460
Hardware, software... we're at a loss.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.310
(beeping)

12:05.330 --> 12:08.010
Detective Fisher, this
is our fixer, Kenny Lee.

12:08.030 --> 12:10.100
We're very sorry to hear
about your colleague.

12:10.120 --> 12:10.910
Thanks.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.920
What was your relationship
like with Jake?

12:12.950 --> 12:15.280
- Professional.
- You two never argued about work?

12:15.300 --> 12:17.290
No, we never argued. We were a team.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.810
Mark, I really gotta get
AVR-SAT2 back online.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.700
- Uh, are you making any progress?
- Not at this moment.

12:24.830 --> 12:28.710
Did you know much about Jake?
Relationships, hobbies?

12:28.740 --> 12:31.530
We believe he was involved in
some type of competitive gaming?

12:31.560 --> 12:34.240
- He was into his games, all right.
- What kind of games did he play?

12:34.270 --> 12:36.380
I don't know what he played,
who he hung out with,

12:36.400 --> 12:38.090
or what the hell he
did to our satellite.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.470
Okay, I know you're upset,

12:40.490 --> 12:43.200
- but we're just trying to do our jobs.
- You and me both.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.520
Any idea why if Jake was shot outside,

12:45.540 --> 12:48.750
- he'd crawl back in here to die?
- No.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.100
You said the NSA might be able to help?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.430
We have on our staff

12:53.460 --> 12:57.030
the most brilliant communication
engineer in the entire NSA.

12:57.050 --> 12:59.210
He has all the right security
clearances. He'd be happy to help.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.060
I don't need help. I need
to not be distracted.

13:03.540 --> 13:04.940
Send him by.

13:04.970 --> 13:08.050
We'll take a look at him and see
if he brings anything to the party.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.660
(elevator dings)

13:12.510 --> 13:13.780
Any leads at AVR?

13:13.800 --> 13:16.110
Well, your dream of living
on Mars may have to wait,

13:16.130 --> 13:17.230
Buzzkill.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.460
Jake took a satellite
off-line before he died.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.690
AVR has less than 48 hours to fix it

13:21.720 --> 13:23.350
before they're forced to
have to self-destruct.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.660
Have they looked at varying trace
lengths based on impedance

13:25.680 --> 13:27.130
to insure there was no sync issues?

13:27.150 --> 13:29.260
That is exactly why
they're expecting you.

13:29.290 --> 13:31.850
- You told them about me?
- Any other leads?

13:31.880 --> 13:35.640
Not unless any of you know something
about competitive video gaming.

13:36.230 --> 13:39.310
- (cell phone beeps)
- (Cameron chuckles)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.540
Fisher: What are
we looking at?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.250
That is Kiyoshi
Otatsume presenting me

13:44.270 --> 13:46.660
with the 2010 single-player
strategy category

13:46.690 --> 13:48.090
in the World Series of Online Gaming.

13:48.110 --> 13:50.190
Ugh. Do you do anything cool?

13:52.070 --> 13:54.370
- See?
- (crowd cheering on phone)

13:54.400 --> 13:55.840
- Yo, where is that?
- The Staples Center.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.120
- That is a massive crowd.
- Eight thousand people.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.770
No one is getting killed over this.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.830
I want to kill myself
watching it, though.

14:01.860 --> 14:04.290
Hey, I found your lightning
bolt and bee logo.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.820
Belongs to an abandoned
automotive warehouse.

14:06.850 --> 14:09.390
Well, I'll follow up on the
gaming angle to be sure.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.960
- Care to help?
- Cameron: Uh, why don't I go with you,

14:11.980 --> 14:13.390
since I know the world and all?

14:13.410 --> 14:16.620
Good luck. Hey, mind if
I go with you to AVR?

14:16.650 --> 14:19.430
- But you don't know...
- Great, you can drive.

14:20.500 --> 14:25.130
- (beeping)
- This is very cool!

14:25.150 --> 14:27.860
(chuckles) Kenny Lee.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.670
This is Dr. Linus Ahluwalia,
Agent Camille Engelson.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.570
They're from the NSA. They're
here to give us a hand.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.220
What do either of you
know about satellites?

14:36.400 --> 14:40.370
Uh, I know they're less complicated
than what we work with all day.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.490
Really? So what do you
think about the quantum

14:42.510 --> 14:44.510
tunneling effect at
smaller process nodes?

14:44.540 --> 14:48.080
With newer technologies,
we've moved to 3D geometries

14:48.110 --> 14:50.180
on the chip, such as
tri-gate transistors.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.470
Fourteen nanometers
reduces leakage power.

14:52.490 --> 14:56.280
- Obviously.
- 480 VDC through a 500 ohm resistor

14:56.300 --> 14:58.220
- should equal how much voltage?
- None.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.810
It equals current in amps and
power in watts, not volts...

15:01.830 --> 15:05.600
0.96 amps and 460.8 watts,

15:05.630 --> 15:08.490
if I'm being exact, which I always am.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.650
How about you?

15:10.790 --> 15:12.960
Sorry, I don't speak pissing contest.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.990
(laughs) Work with them.

15:20.590 --> 15:23.560
- (knocks)
- Come in, close the door.

15:25.030 --> 15:28.880
What I'm about to show
you stays between us.

15:33.430 --> 15:37.530
- Where'd you get these?
- I hired a PI off the books

15:37.550 --> 15:40.720
to follow Ivy for a few days. I
wanted to see what we could see

15:40.740 --> 15:43.490
while also keeping it off the NSA radar.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.350
Well, clearly we have a problem.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.650
Or an opportunity.

15:50.710 --> 15:54.020
- (buzzing)
- Linus: Damn it.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.250
Every time I think I've got
the problem figured out.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.270
You're using the wrong file extension.

15:59.060 --> 16:01.580
You're gonna teach me how to
run system diagnostics now?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.660
Yes, because you're
not running anything.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.660
Hell, you're barely crawling.
You're welcome.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.380
(beeping)

16:13.920 --> 16:16.720
Uh, what was that all about?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.990
- I just needed some air.
- Is that it?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.420
- How'd your talk with Ivy go?
- We're back on track.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.080
She's coming here later. She
wants to bring me dinner.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.660
- Well, can't win 'em all.
- I thought you were past that with Ivy.

16:28.690 --> 16:29.860
You two seemed to get along.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.950
Not as well as you and
Amanda in the kitchen.

16:31.970 --> 16:35.020
- What did you say to her?
- I may have simply put her on notice

16:35.040 --> 16:38.540
about using you to get information
back to Stinger Senior.

16:38.570 --> 16:39.530
Why would you do that?

16:39.550 --> 16:42.030
Because I'm trying to
protect all our asses, Linus.

16:42.050 --> 16:44.540
Who asked you to? And here's something,

16:44.560 --> 16:46.570
you're no genius when it
comes to relationships,

16:46.600 --> 16:49.230
so just stay out of mine!

16:50.740 --> 16:53.880
I'm sorry. I know things
between you and Amanda are...

16:54.590 --> 16:57.700
- What?
- We need her.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.180
Who?

16:59.580 --> 17:01.830
Amanda.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.810

Kirsten: That's Zelda in
the ring, from the stitch.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.230
I also saw that guy.

(beeping)

18:49.450 --> 18:52.310
(music continues)

18:52.440 --> 18:55.760
Hey. Found some interesting
stuff on the backroom computer.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah, this place is generating

18:58.280 --> 19:00.470
tens of thousands of dollars a night,

19:00.490 --> 19:02.660
and Jake Rowland was recently on a roll,

19:02.690 --> 19:04.900
winning most of his
matches against Zelda.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.470
Yeah, I'm wondering if the
competition between Jake and Zelda

19:07.490 --> 19:09.360
got a little heated and she killed him?

19:09.390 --> 19:11.200
Zelda. Yeah, okay. Got it.

19:11.230 --> 19:14.460
Okay, here's another thing,
there's no Internet access here,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.770
so the entire gaming system
is completely off the grid.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.360
Probably to make it unhackable,
preserve the integrity of the game.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.520
Right. Right. Let's get going,
see what else is on these files.

19:22.540 --> 19:24.740
Well, actually, I think I'm gonna
stick around, see what I can learn.

19:24.770 --> 19:27.470
Uh, okay. You do that.

19:27.490 --> 19:29.390
Hey, hey. Look, look, come on.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.380
- You can't stay mad at me forever.
- Challenge accepted.

19:32.410 --> 19:35.360

20:14.610 --> 20:17.450
- So what's the game?
- War Zone.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.770
- Huh. Never heard of it.
- You wouldn't.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.050
- It's not available to the public.
- Really?

20:22.070 --> 20:24.630
- Then who developed it?
- Nobody knows,

20:24.650 --> 20:27.890
- but he or she is a genius.
- Hmm.

20:28.110 --> 20:31.300
That's Rick. He's kind
of a promoting machine.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.440
He put together this whole
underground digital fight club.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.680
What? Do people bet on the matches?

20:36.700 --> 20:39.350
(laughs) Yeah. Money makes
everything more intense.

20:39.380 --> 20:43.020

22:04.920 --> 22:06.610
- Good work, noob.
- No way.

22:06.630 --> 22:09.200
- You cheated!
- (grunts)

22:11.120 --> 22:13.950
- (grunts)
- (crowd murmurs)

22:15.030 --> 22:16.730
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.370
- (crowd shouting)
- (music continues)

22:32.220 --> 22:34.290
- You kicked ass out there.
- Oh.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.350
Thanks. Does it always
get this physical?

22:39.130 --> 22:41.720
People take War Zone very seriously.

22:41.740 --> 22:44.300
Oh. Actually, I heard someone talking

22:44.330 --> 22:46.140
about some guy who died the other day.

22:46.160 --> 22:49.530
Jake... Jake something.
Did you know him?

22:49.740 --> 22:53.280
Uh, yeah. I didn't like him very much.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.410
He was a little full
of himself, but, uh...

22:56.190 --> 22:58.320
we were good in the ring together.

22:58.340 --> 23:01.230
- You guys played each other?
- Yeah. A lot.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.330
(Rick claps)

23:02.360 --> 23:05.170
- Hey, new guy, how's the eye? Eye good?
- Yeah, yeah, it's throbbing,

23:05.190 --> 23:07.490
- but, you know.
- That's good. Look, um...

23:07.520 --> 23:11.350
would you be interested in coming back?

23:11.380 --> 23:14.200
I think you're a natural. You had
this place going nuts tonight.

23:14.250 --> 23:17.180
- Yeah, yeah, game on.
- Great. All right.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.480
Good. Well, get some rest,
and I'll see you soon.

23:19.510 --> 23:20.840
Cool.

23:23.830 --> 23:27.530
Next time he's in here, find
out what you can about him.

23:29.130 --> 23:31.110
Great work, Zelda.

23:32.350 --> 23:35.780
- (cell phone clicks)
- (line ringing)

23:37.790 --> 23:39.090
(beeps)

23:39.540 --> 23:41.320
- Hey.
- Ivy (on phone): <i> Hey.</i>

23:41.350 --> 23:42.800
Just checking in if now's a good time.

23:42.830 --> 23:46.170
- I'd be there in about 15.
- Perfect. Uh, just let me know

23:46.190 --> 23:48.260
when you get here, and I'll meet
you outside. Security's nuts.

23:48.300 --> 23:51.050
- Sounds good. Can't wait.
- Linus: <i> Me too.</i>

23:51.080 --> 23:53.190
(phone beeps, clatters)

24:09.290 --> 24:12.030
You know, your father once
paid someone to kill me?

24:12.120 --> 24:13.530
Good thing he didn't succeed,

24:13.550 --> 24:15.320
otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here.

24:15.340 --> 24:16.750
- Well, at least I wouldn't.
- (door opens)

24:16.780 --> 24:19.700
- Ms. Brown.
- You want to tell me why I'm here?

24:19.730 --> 24:21.830
How long have you been in
contact with your father?

24:22.380 --> 24:24.050
I'm not.

24:24.070 --> 24:27.180
We know as well as you do that
you've been seeing Daniel Stinger.

24:27.560 --> 24:32.340
Wherever you're getting your
information from is... incorrect.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.140
- I want a lawyer.
- Yeah, that's not really our thing.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.690
He came to me.

24:52.510 --> 24:55.310
Wanted me to help him. I told him no.

24:55.340 --> 24:56.580
End of story.

24:56.600 --> 25:00.370
That sounds a lot like a story with
only a beginning and a middle.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.200
Not sure I trust the ending.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.870
- What is gonna happen to me?
- Well, that all depends on you.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.400
(beeping)

25:14.250 --> 25:17.220
- What is all of this?
- I realized it wasn't software,

25:17.250 --> 25:19.060
so then I thought the
problem was hardware,

25:19.080 --> 25:22.220
- but I was wrong.
- Best the NSA has to offer, huh?

25:23.960 --> 25:26.810
- Who's this?
- Oh, relax, Ace. She's with me.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.740
Amanda. It's good to see ya.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.220
Is it?

25:30.250 --> 25:33.180
So, this is what we're working with.

25:33.430 --> 25:36.560
Amanda: Yeah, that is
definitely some bloody sand.

25:36.590 --> 25:40.050
- But you see it, right?
- Yeah, I see it.

25:40.070 --> 25:41.040
What do you need?

25:41.980 --> 25:43.580
Space.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.240
Mars is all yours.

25:53.070 --> 25:55.270
Ah! Nice of you to show up.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.140
Camille and Linus are
on their way from AVR.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.590
The refractory period is over.
What the hell happened?

26:02.620 --> 26:06.070
Underground video gaming.
It is unbelievable.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.010
It's literally unlike anything
I've ever experienced.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.080
It's better than sex... Excuse me.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.400
Uh, about last night...

26:13.610 --> 26:17.860
Oh. Yeah. This. I discovered
my new favorite, ah, hobby.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.720
Getting hit in the face?

26:19.750 --> 26:21.290
Did Zelda do that to you?

26:21.310 --> 26:23.310
Look, not every girl I know
wants to punch me in the face.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.170
Just you.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.230
Well, did you find
something out at least?

26:26.250 --> 26:28.500
Not yet, but I'm going back there
tonight to see what I can find.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.640
I'm sure you can use your face to
beat the information out of someone.

26:31.670 --> 26:33.790
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:33.810 --> 26:36.440
Come on, aren't you a
little concerned about me?

26:36.460 --> 26:38.130
Of course.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.800
- Please be careful.
- Mmm.

26:41.340 --> 26:44.800
- You're no good to me dead.
- (groans)

26:45.850 --> 26:47.760
Close enough.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.920
Cameron: Tell me what you see, K.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.290
Jake and Zelda are having an argument.

26:54.310 --> 26:55.730
I am not feeling the love here.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.680
You don't know what
you're talking about.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.550
Yeah. I'm not seeing any
oxytocin spikes with them.

27:01.590 --> 27:02.340
<i>Quel dommage.</i>

27:02.370 --> 27:05.270
No, you're cheating.
No one is that good.

27:05.300 --> 27:09.620
- You don't understand.
- Zelda just accused Jake of cheating.

27:12.580 --> 27:16.120
We're in AVR. Jake's got
a copy of the game up.

27:17.350 --> 27:19.950
- He beat the game.
- So, he was cheating.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.470
Wait. Zelda said that
the game wasn't public,

27:21.500 --> 27:22.960
so how does Jake have
it on his computer?

27:22.980 --> 27:24.880
(beeping)

27:32.150 --> 27:34.090
Got another memory hotspot coming up.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.150
Stand by, K. Moving
you to another level.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.650
- Hell of a game, Jake.
- Thanks.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.400
Kirsten: Jake just won
a boatload of money...

27:44.430 --> 27:47.070
- Rick: Here.
- Kirsten: But he's...

27:48.260 --> 27:50.410
really being quite awkward about it.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.750
Right, because he was cheating?

27:58.950 --> 28:01.910
He's putting up a satellite
dish of some kind.

28:01.970 --> 28:04.600
- Cameron: <i> Where?</i>
- Uh, I'm not sure.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.220
Rooftop somewhere?

28:06.250 --> 28:08.130
- (beeping)
- Eighteen seconds.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.290
You're lying. I'm tired of
you being so secretive.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.970
I just need you to trust me, okay?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.590
I can't explain it to you right now.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.930
Jake and Kenny are arguing.

28:15.950 --> 28:17.750
So, that's it? You're just leaving?

28:17.770 --> 28:20.220
I promise you, it will
all make sense soon.

28:20.250 --> 28:23.620
Forget it. Just tell me
what you did to the rover,

28:23.640 --> 28:27.140
- or Mark is gonna fire me.
- He's not gonna fire you!

28:27.170 --> 28:29.360
I told you, I'm not
gonna let that happen.

28:29.390 --> 28:33.560
You can do this. Stop
overthinking everything.

28:33.590 --> 28:36.660
It's just a game. Trust me, okay?

28:37.620 --> 28:40.330
(heart beating)

28:40.870 --> 28:43.580
- Time's up!
- Make the bounce!

28:43.880 --> 28:45.840
(beeping)

28:47.150 --> 28:48.970
(breathes heavily)

28:49.350 --> 28:52.730
Kenny didn't kill Jake, and they
weren't just coworkers or friends.

28:52.750 --> 28:56.090
- They were lovers.
- Well, why hide it?

28:56.110 --> 28:58.880
Well, AVR has a strict dating policy.
They would've been fired.

28:58.910 --> 29:02.000
Did Jake tell Kenny how
he gremlined the rover?

29:02.020 --> 29:03.260
Not that I saw,

29:03.290 --> 29:06.200
so I doubt he would've told him
how he gremlined the satellite.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.150
But if Kenny didn't kill
Jake, then who did?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.870
I've got Amanda working
on that as we speak.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.180
Good timing. I was just about
to run the simulation.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.950
Ladies, gentlemen, without further ado,

29:24.980 --> 29:27.930
I captured the area in
high-def, digitized it,

29:27.950 --> 29:30.280
and by analyzing the
blood-spread pattern,

29:30.300 --> 29:33.360
reversed the shifting sand
and digitally recreated

29:33.380 --> 29:35.390
whatever Mr. Rowland's
final message was.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.470
Let's roll back the sands
of time, shall we?

29:38.490 --> 29:41.060
(sighs)

29:41.670 --> 29:43.670
(beeping)

29:51.950 --> 29:53.110
Cameron: What is that?

29:53.130 --> 29:54.770
Camille: Looks like a
pattern of some kind?

29:56.480 --> 29:59.010
- I thought it would be a name.
- Yeah, me too.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.750
- Zelda.
- Zelda didn't kill Jake.

30:01.770 --> 30:04.330
And you know this because
you know her so well?

30:04.350 --> 30:07.080
It's just... it's just
not the vibe I got.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.770
Vibe? We solve our cases by vibe now?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.540
I'm definitely getting a vibe here.

30:11.570 --> 30:15.970
Okay. I'm going back to the warehouse,
see what else I can find out.

30:18.190 --> 30:19.810
Cameron, wait.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.050
Look, we can't keep doing
this to each other, Stretch.

30:23.070 --> 30:26.940
Just me being mad at you, you
being mad at me, it's... (sighs)

30:26.980 --> 30:28.390
It's turning me into someone I'm not.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.840
I don't like being this
mad at you either.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.830
I just... I don't...

30:32.700 --> 30:36.490
- I don't know how to stop. Not yet.
- (sighs)

30:37.580 --> 30:39.250
Just...

30:40.240 --> 30:43.540
please don't do anything stupid
while I'm figuring it out, okay?

30:45.650 --> 30:47.190
I'll try.

30:50.190 --> 30:53.690
Oh, good. The amateurs who are here
to help fix nothing are leaving.

30:53.710 --> 30:56.950
I know you're hurting, but
we're all here to help.

30:56.970 --> 30:59.770
What's your skill then, hmm?
Electronics?

30:59.810 --> 31:02.740
Astrophysics? Satellite communications?
Engineering?

31:02.780 --> 31:05.180
- What's your super power?
- Death.

31:06.110 --> 31:08.820
Death is my super power.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.530
Seems like you got this.
I'm gonna head out.

31:13.550 --> 31:16.490
Umm, can I call you later?

31:17.020 --> 31:18.750
I don't think that's a good idea.

31:19.070 --> 31:21.840
I mean, work is work
and I'm happy to help,

31:21.860 --> 31:24.500
but... as far as you and I go...

31:25.030 --> 31:28.200
we're just on totally different planets.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.310
Is this because of what I said?

31:30.780 --> 31:33.120
I gotta go. Take care of yourself.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.340
Yeah.

31:40.170 --> 31:43.820
- What? Let's get back to work.
- What's the point?

31:43.850 --> 31:45.690
We're gonna have to
initiate self-destruct

31:45.720 --> 31:47.570
and blow our bird out of the
sky in a matter of hours,

31:47.590 --> 31:49.400
so this freak show is over anyway.

31:54.170 --> 31:55.740
Wait.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.640
Jake had another workstation
here, didn't he?

31:59.660 --> 32:00.630
Someplace with a couch?

32:00.650 --> 32:03.000
- How did you know that?
- Show us.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.910
(computers beeping)

32:04.930 --> 32:06.720
He would work down
here sometimes

32:06.740 --> 32:09.340
when he didn't want
Mark to pester him.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.340
Nobody knew about it.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.130
- Except you.
- Except me.

32:14.540 --> 32:16.730
Never gets any easier, does it?

32:16.750 --> 32:21.430
One way or another, we always
lose the things we love.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.680
But if we find it, it doesn't matter.

32:30.230 --> 32:32.400
Because it's worth it.

32:36.690 --> 32:38.900
(beeps)

32:40.180 --> 32:41.920
How did you know Jake's password?

32:41.950 --> 32:44.820
(keyboard clacking)

32:44.840 --> 32:47.210
Well, there's nothing
on here about Rick.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.210
There it is. There's the game. War Zone.

32:53.550 --> 32:55.540
Shove. Let me see something.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.590
- (beeps)
- Huh.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.220
Well, there are 41
iterations of the game.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.010
- Kenny: What does that mean?
- It means Jake created it.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.770
- Shove. Let me see something.
- All right.

33:16.890 --> 33:17.840
(beeping)

33:17.860 --> 33:19.970
Linus: Someone has
been working overtime.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.510
Jake made a recent addition

33:21.540 --> 33:24.020
to the very end of the
final level of the game,

33:24.040 --> 33:26.890
but... it's encrypted.

33:27.210 --> 33:29.510
Okay, so Jake anonymously
created a game,

33:29.530 --> 33:31.630
and then made money
off winning that game

33:31.660 --> 33:34.250
in a competitive underground
gaming circuit?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.410
The computers at the warehouse
weren't connected to the Internet.

33:36.430 --> 33:40.200
How could Jake have altered the
game in the warehouse from here?

33:40.230 --> 33:42.300
I know how.

33:47.390 --> 33:49.120
I know why we couldn't figure out

33:49.160 --> 33:50.780
how Jake gremlined the satellite.

33:50.810 --> 33:53.450
- It's because he didn't.
- Then why is it off-line?

33:53.480 --> 33:56.120
It's not. It's just not
pointed towards Mars.

33:56.150 --> 33:58.400
Well, where's it aimed then?

33:58.430 --> 34:01.070
- There.
- Kirsten: That's the warehouse.

34:03.070 --> 34:05.400
Jake put a satellite dish
on the roof next door.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.570
Which would explain how he was
able to download the game

34:07.600 --> 34:09.580
from here to the closed
system at the warehouse.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.219
Jake gremlined the warehouse, not AVR.

34:12.239 --> 34:14.860
- Let's re-aim that satellite.
- How long do we have?

34:14.880 --> 34:16.239
Two hours before
self-destruct.

34:16.270 --> 34:17.760
Look, Jake focused
it there for a reason.

34:17.810 --> 34:19.429
We owe it to him to find out why.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.630
(crowd shouting)

34:21.650 --> 34:25.190
- (video game noises)
- (rock music playing)

34:26.070 --> 34:29.550
- You ready to take me on?
- Absolutely.

34:32.780 --> 34:36.290
- I'll see you out there.
- All right.

34:39.230 --> 34:42.040
(music continues, muffled)

34:43.230 --> 34:46.230
- Hey, what's up?
- He's NSA.

34:46.270 --> 34:48.540
What did you do?

34:48.940 --> 34:51.870
(sighs, chuckles)

34:54.820 --> 34:56.540
I'm sure it's nothing.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.880
Sneak that back to him.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.390
Hey.

35:03.050 --> 35:05.220
Don't worry about anything, all right?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.100
(sighs)

35:15.770 --> 35:17.610
Like you said, noob...

35:17.630 --> 35:20.750
- (gun cocks)
- game on.

35:26.670 --> 35:28.600
Kirsten: Cameron.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.850
Oh. Hey, so, did you come to
cheer me on or discourage me?

35:31.870 --> 35:33.810
Inspire you. You have to win this match.

35:33.830 --> 35:36.400
- Why?
- We think Jake coded a message,

35:36.420 --> 35:38.360
and it's hidden at the end of
the final level of War Zone,

35:38.380 --> 35:40.520
but it's only accessible
for the next 45 minutes

35:40.540 --> 35:42.480
until we have to
reposition the satellite.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.180
Okay, nothing you just said
makes any sense to me.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.090
Just win the freaking game, and it will.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.050
(rock music playing)

35:51.080 --> 35:53.100
Rick: All right, all right, all right.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.190
The match we've all been waiting for.

35:56.210 --> 36:03.120
The noob versus our very own Zelda!

36:03.140 --> 36:07.030
(cheering)

36:09.170 --> 36:12.660
He knows you're NSA.
Get out while you can.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.630
Not until I win this match.

36:16.650 --> 36:18.310
- Rick: Noob.
- It's your funeral.

36:18.340 --> 36:20.850
Rick: Zelda. Ready?

36:21.140 --> 36:23.460
- And begin.
- (video game noises)

36:23.490 --> 36:27.220
- (rock music playing)

36:47.940 --> 36:50.270

37:02.770 --> 37:06.370
- Bro, she's kicking your ass. Give up.
- Yeah, I think I know that.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.820
How much time do we have
before Kenny and Camille

37:07.850 --> 37:08.730
reposition the satellite?

37:08.760 --> 37:12.260
- A couple minutes.
- (Cameron sighs) Okay.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.440
- Zelda.
- You're going down this round.

37:25.470 --> 37:28.290
- Jake needs your help.
- Don't you mean you need my help?

37:28.310 --> 37:32.150
No, Jake. He's waiting for
us at the end of this game.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.860
He left us a message, and I think
it has to lead to his killer.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.180
Why should I believe you?

37:36.200 --> 37:39.360
Because you want to see how
this ends as badly as I do.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.010
Look, War Zone was designed

37:44.030 --> 37:46.690
so that one player can't
let another player win.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.850
If I take it easy on you,

37:48.880 --> 37:51.200
the computer's gonna
take over my game play.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.910
Then we have to beat the computer...

37:53.930 --> 37:57.610
- together.
- Rick: All right, final round.

37:57.640 --> 38:01.290
Noob, Zelda, you ready? And begin.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.730
- (rock music playing)
- (crowd shouting, cheering)

38:05.760 --> 38:08.890
- (crowd booing)
- Play, noob.

38:12.770 --> 38:15.570
Rick: Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

38:20.940 --> 38:23.550
Play him right now! Zelda!

38:23.570 --> 38:26.550
- (video game noises)
- He's not winning.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.720
Rick: Okay. Everybody, everybody.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.390
(people shouting)

38:44.250 --> 38:47.240
- (explosion)
- (beeps)

38:47.260 --> 38:48.460
Woman: What?

38:48.490 --> 38:50.160
- (crowd murmuring)
- What is that?

38:50.450 --> 38:52.650
That looks like a pattern of some sort.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.820
It's a pattern from AVR.
It's a passcode.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.830
Man: What is this? Come on!

39:02.060 --> 39:04.500
(beeping)

39:04.730 --> 39:07.090
(Rick laughs) What is this?

39:10.250 --> 39:12.510
(clangs)

39:15.470 --> 39:17.910
Jake: <i>If you're seeing this,
then I'm already gone.</i>

39:17.940 --> 39:19.170
<i>My name is Jake Rowland,</i>

39:19.200 --> 39:21.080
<i>and I created the game War Zone.</i>

39:21.110 --> 39:24.280
<i>Rick DeToro, he took
advantage of my secret,</i>

39:24.300 --> 39:26.870
<i>he threatened everything
that I cared about...</i>

39:26.930 --> 39:28.490
All right, this is
some kind of a joke.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.320
<i>And turned War Zone and me</i>

39:30.340 --> 39:32.820
<i>- into his own cash machine.</i>
- No, no, no, no. This is...

39:32.840 --> 39:35.560
- I don't know what's going on!
<i>- He forced me to play</i>

39:35.590 --> 39:38.720
<i>- and rigged the odds. Well, Rick...</i>
- All right!

39:38.740 --> 39:40.910
<i>My secret's out now.</i>

39:41.130 --> 39:42.510
<i>So is yours.</i>

39:42.540 --> 39:44.690
- (crowd shouting)
- (beeping)

39:44.720 --> 39:47.680
- Okay, stay back! Everybody get back!
- (people scream)

39:47.710 --> 39:51.320
- (grunts)
- Game over!

39:51.450 --> 39:53.670
Well played, DK.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.730
Mm-hmm.

39:55.910 --> 40:00.350
Rick DeToro? You're under arrest
for the murder of Jake Rowland.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.680
(sighs)

40:04.080 --> 40:07.310
- Yeah.
- Jake would've liked you.
