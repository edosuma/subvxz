02:57.844 --> 02:59.402
- Oh, hey, Bren.
- Hey.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.069
- Working hard?
- I think so.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.238
I'm auditioning for Roy Randolph.
Ever hear of him?

03:03.416 --> 03:06.112
Yes, actually, when I was 12,
my mom took me to New York City.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.345
<i>We saw his production
of A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

03:08.521 --> 03:11.388
Starred Holly Hunter before she was
a big star. It was pretty awesome.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.026
Yeah, he's known
for having an eye for young talent.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.752
And you are hoping
to catch that, huh?

03:15.929 --> 03:17.556
But of course.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.893
<i>He's directing a main-stage production
of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

03:21.067 --> 03:22.796
I mean, can't you see me
in the Maggie role?

03:22.969 --> 03:25.836
Now that you mention it,
I do see you as kind of a young Liz,

03:26.005 --> 03:28.405
minus the eight marriages,
give or take a Richard Burton.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.805
Thank you.
Anyway, I better get going.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.501
The ladies of the Peach Pit
are waiting.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.704
Yeah, you know what,
I'm gonna go there myself,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.473
but I gotta pick up some books
for Erica.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.048
What is she reading these days?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.242
<i>The Man Who Shot Lincoln,</i>

03:39.419 --> 03:42.786
<i>The Lincoln Murder Mystery,
The Unsolved Lincoln Murder Case.</i>

03:42.956 --> 03:44.048
Do I see a pattern here?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.215
Yeah, my little sister's
quite the conspiracy buff.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.984
Wait ten minutes, I'll give you a ride.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.892
No, thanks. If I'm late for these
sorority meetings, I get demerits.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.862
- Yeah, see you.
- Bye.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.425
Andrea, don't be so hard
on yourself.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.300
Well, I think you look great
in Jesse's clothes. It's very stylish.

04:02.475 --> 04:06.138
Yeah, well, with our budget,
I'm just lucky grunge is in.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.046
You guys, the way I'm expanding,
in the next couple of weeks,

04:09.215 --> 04:11.547
I won't even fit into his clothes.
It's so depressing.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.381
It's settled. I'm gonna go and get you
some of Jackie's old maternity dresses.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.017
- She still has them?
- She never throws anything away.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.625
She'd be glad to let you
wear them for as long as you want.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.386
Kel, that's great.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.361
Who's that guy over there
with Dylan's sister and her mom?

04:26.866 --> 04:28.356
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.559
Oh, come on, it will be my treat.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.568
- How about a milkshake?
- No.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.798
- Are you sure?
- I said I don't want one.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.272
Erica, how about trying
"no, thank you"?

04:38.478 --> 04:39.672
No, thank you.

04:42.882 --> 04:43.974
Excuse me.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.915
Excuse me, Kelly,
have you seen Dylan?

04:52.091 --> 04:53.353
He was supposed to meet us here.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.857
He's at the library.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.622
I just ran into him.
He's on his way over.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.129
Well, enjoy your sorority meeting.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.063
So, what is this sorority?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.362
Well, after we graduated
from West Beverly,

05:04.537 --> 05:07.062
we didn't want college life
to split us up.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.435
So we have these little gatherings here
once a week,

05:09.609 --> 05:11.304
so we can all see each other.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.140
Oh, so I guess you had to go
to West Beverly to be in your sorority?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.976
Well, maybe not.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.845
I don't know about the rest of you,

05:19.018 --> 05:21.043
but I think a little pledge rush
might be in order.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.212
I think maybe so. Sit down.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.586
Great, what do I have to do?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.557
You have to promise
to be a good friend.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.890
And you can never, ever, ever
forget your sisters.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.192
And not be afraid to dish a little dirt.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.528
Starting with who is that guy
with your mom over there?

05:36.703 --> 05:38.694
Her new boyfriend.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.036
I never liked any
of my mom's boyfriends either.

05:44.610 --> 05:49.104
Hey, Nat, any words of wisdom
on why Communism fell?

05:49.282 --> 05:51.648
I think it had something to do
with 90-proof vodka.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.150
- Can I quote you on that?
- Sure.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.913
Guess who?

05:58.991 --> 06:00.253
A little help here, Nat.

06:00.426 --> 06:03.122
Oh, I've never seen her before,
but I wouldn't mind seeing her again.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.764
Too late, time's up.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.401
- Clare.
- Hi.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.230
Hi.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.031
Nat, this is Clare Arnold.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.266
Her father, besides being the head
of the Educational Task Force,

06:16.442 --> 06:19.070
is also the esteemed chancellor
of CU.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.542
Oh, privileged to meet you.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.078
Likewise.

06:22.248 --> 06:25.217
My father's secretary
said this is where you hang out.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.321
And shock of shocks,
she was right about something.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.719
Well, you certainly
seem chipper today.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.722
Oh, well, I had my birthday
last week.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.326
The big 1-8.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.429
Oh, congratulations.

06:37.597 --> 06:42.557
Yeah, somehow, magically,
overnight the words "jailbait"

06:42.735 --> 06:46.796
just kind of vanished
from my forehead. Voilà.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.041
Well, it was nice seeing you again,
Clare. I was just leaving.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.336
Great, me too.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.945
Bye.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.351
- Are you all right?
- Oh, that depends on you.

07:02.522 --> 07:03.546
How so?

07:03.723 --> 07:05.657
What would you say
if I wanted to go out with you?

07:05.825 --> 07:07.690
I'd say I don't think
that's a good idea, Clare.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.761
Oh, come on,
we'll go to a movie, a club,

07:10.930 --> 07:13.455
swap French kisses
on a quake-damaged freeway.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.658
I really don't think
that's a good idea, Clare.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.598
Why not? I'm legal.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.362
So I hear.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.507
Oh, what, are you, like, freaked out
or something

07:21.674 --> 07:22.800
because of who my father is?

07:22.975 --> 07:25.842
- Absolutely.
- I knew it.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.003
- But you like me, don't you?
- Of course.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.344
I like you a lot. You're very unusual.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.077
Thanks, I wouldn't wanna be
like everybody else.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.814
- Well, you're certainly not.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.651
Hey, Brandon, how's it going?

07:39.826 --> 07:43.956
Dylan, this is Clare Arnold,
Chancellor Arnold's daughter.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.691
- Oh, yeah, it's nice to meet you, Clare.
- Nice to meet you too.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.331
<i>- Bye, mon chéri.
- Bye.</i>

07:54.907 --> 07:56.238
You taste good.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.245
<i>Listen, mon chéri,
I sort of thought after Lucinda,</i>

08:03.416 --> 08:05.976
you would be playing the monk
about now.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.779
This is much worse than Lucinda.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.478
Take it from a friend, just say whoa.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.555
- I thought I did.
- I don't think she heard you.

08:11.724 --> 08:14.818
I think you're right. Listen, I gotta get
over to Steve's and work on my paper.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.394
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
It's a little gnarly.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.594
No sweat.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.199
Hey, we've been waiting for you.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.936
Well, excuse me.
I'm 15 minutes late for my life.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.841
- This is...
- You must be Kevin.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.447
- Kevin Weaver.
- Hi. Dylan McKay.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.140
- It's great to meet you, sit down.
- Okay.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.342
Dylan, come here.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.578
Did you get my books?

08:41.754 --> 08:44.279
You'll have to excuse me.
The boss is calling.

08:47.793 --> 08:51.820
You think the boss
is ever gonna give me a break, huh?

08:57.069 --> 08:59.731
Honey, I can't find
my black bathing suit.

08:59.906 --> 09:03.569
I already packed the plaid one,
along with your hooded robe.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.109
I look kind of chunky in the plaid.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.543
If we're gonna sit around
in a hot spring with the Levins,

09:08.714 --> 09:10.341
I wanna look as svelte as they are.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.679
Honestly, I'm sorry we bid
on this vacation with them.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.788
Oh, come on, it's for a good cause.

09:16.956 --> 09:21.689
Anyway, two days in Palm Desert,
away from the grind

09:21.861 --> 09:23.021
could be very romantic.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.595
I hope you're not saying that
just because it's tax deductible.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.933
- I'm not gonna forget that comment.
- I'm counting on it.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.365
Brenda, would you come put away
these pots?

09:31.537 --> 09:33.232
Why certainly, Mama.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.898
Although I was born
for more than the kitchen work.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.407
Weren't we all?

09:38.578 --> 09:39.772
How's my southern drawl?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.437
Oh, it's very Tennessee Williams.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.516
I hope you're not putting too much
pressure on yourself about this play.

09:45.685 --> 09:46.982
Mom, how could I?

09:47.153 --> 09:48.450
I mean, working with Roy Randolph

09:48.621 --> 09:50.987
is a chance of a lifetime
for any actress.

09:51.157 --> 09:54.058
And let's face it,
that's what I wanna be.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.161
I know, I just wish you didn't have
your heart set on the lead.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.958
I mean, isn't there
maybe a smaller part?

10:00.132 --> 10:01.929
Thanks for the encouragement.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.593
I'm sorry, I just don't want you
to be disappointed.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.104
Mom, I won't be.
I am Maggie the Cat.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.867
A woman scorned
by the man that she loves?

10:11.043 --> 10:12.772
I understand
the character completely.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.776
Well, I'll be crossing my fingers
for you.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.574
Thanks. I hope you guys have fun.

10:16.749 --> 10:17.977
Oh, we will.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.380
Oh, listen, while you're housesitting
for the Levins...

10:20.553 --> 10:21.850
Mom, don't worry.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.615
I'm just across the street,
and I have their cats.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.122
And Kelly's coming over
for the afternoon to practice lines.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.317
Kelly is?

10:28.494 --> 10:30.018
Yeah, I guess
when all is said and done,

10:30.196 --> 10:32.221
she really cares
about maintaining our friendship.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.490
That's great.

10:33.666 --> 10:34.894
Yeah, it is.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.930
You know, I think
I'm finally in the college groove.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.700
It's just a matter
of narrowing down my distractions.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.604
Well, cutting down
on the booze and the babes

10:44.777 --> 10:46.039
is always a formula for success.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.112
No, I'm talking
about late-night television.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.771
Jay, Dave, Conan,
who needs these people?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.713
<i>And Nightline, Ted Koppel.</i>

10:52.885 --> 10:55.820
Every time I see this guy's face,
I gotta wonder if he has legs.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.546
Think anybody's ever seen them?

10:57.723 --> 11:00.021
Don't ask me, bro.
At that hour, I'm studying.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.784
Oh, I think you need
to take a lap, Walsh.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.792
Yeah, I'll see you later, citizen.
Ride free.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.123
Ciao.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.265
Oh, out of order?

11:07.433 --> 11:10.334
Stop it, you monsters.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.373
Somebody help me!

11:16.542 --> 11:17.668
Go away, you...!

11:19.879 --> 11:22.109
- Steve.
- Laura.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.175
What are you doing here?

11:24.350 --> 11:26.978
I heard somebody screaming.
I thought someone was in trouble.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.518
Obviously, I was wrong.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.488
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I was a little loud.

11:32.658 --> 11:33.750
I was just acting.

11:33.926 --> 11:37.225
I'm getting myself ready
to try out for this play.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.729
Well, I'd say if there's any screaming,
you'll do fine. See you.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.800
Wait, please.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.334
You just startled me.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.269
I shouldn't have snapped at you.
You were just being concerned.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.807
Yeah, I thought so.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.077
Bye.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.249
Steve.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.182
I've seen you around campus.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.653
But I must admit,
I try pretty hard to avoid you.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.359
Yeah, well, for whatever it's worth,

12:08.527 --> 12:10.552
I still don't feel right
about what you went through.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.863
Yeah, well, it's been a pretty miserable,
lonely year for me.

12:16.368 --> 12:21.032
I guess that's why I'm working so hard
on this play, you know.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.936
I'm hoping
maybe it will turn things around.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.441
<i>Cat On A Hot Tin Roof.</i>

12:26.412 --> 12:29.210
You know, before my mother
became the mother of all sitcoms,

12:29.381 --> 12:32.282
she actually had the lead
in a production they did here in L.A.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.975
Really?

12:34.153 --> 12:36.951
I'm reading for the lead.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.920
Oh, yeah? It's a great play.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.615
Gosh, I must've seen it
a hundred times.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.159
I was practically living
in her dressing room.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.322
Your mom is really talented.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.996
Thanks. I'll tell her you said so.

12:51.303 --> 12:59.142
You know, the last time that we spoke
was after that crazy week.

13:00.646 --> 13:04.707
You offered to still be my friend,
but I couldn't handle it then.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.447
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.183
You know, I don't know
how this is gonna sound, Laura, but...

13:14.326 --> 13:16.886
If you like a hand
with your audition material,

13:17.062 --> 13:18.529
I guess I'd be happy to help you out.

13:18.697 --> 13:21.962
- Would you?
- Yeah, I figure I owe you one.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.864
That I could definitely handle.
Thanks.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.107
Heigh-ho, Silver.
What's happening?

13:36.282 --> 13:37.647
Hell, man.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.841
Big workload?

13:39.018 --> 13:40.986
No, school's fine. It's the stupid dog.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.815
He chews through the electrical cords,
I'm the one who gets blamed.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.854
He rips through the garbage,
I get yelled at.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.583
Bad puppy.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.024
What's taking your sister so long
with my yogurt?

13:52.231 --> 13:54.028
Oh, excuse me.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.430
Oh, my God, you're Roy Randolph.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.195
Well, I suppose
that's the proper billing:

13:59.371 --> 14:00.929
God before Roy.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.472
But normally, I'm used to my name
being above the title.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.970
I didn't spill anything on you, did I?

14:06.145 --> 14:09.080
No, no harm done. But I suggest
you try walking without reading.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.477
Well, I was just really trying
to understand the play.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.620
Oh, are you studying it for class,
or are you reading for me tomorrow?

14:15.788 --> 14:17.449
For you, the part of Maggie.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.018
Really?

14:20.192 --> 14:27.155
Well, I like her fetching,
love-starved and dangerous.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.569
Those are the only hints I'll give you.

14:33.639 --> 14:37.131
You know, I have to tell you,
I'm a tremendous fan of yours.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.469
In fact, when I found out

14:38.644 --> 14:40.236
you were gonna be
our artist-in-residence,

14:40.412 --> 14:42.710
I went to the library
and studied all about you.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.282
Well, it's nice meeting you.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.942
Brenda, Brenda Walsh.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.144
Till tomorrow.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.221
Yeah, and no more walking
and reading.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.789
That's right.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.416
Nothing should inhibit the moves
of a dangerous woman.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.962
I'll remember that.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.532
Bravo.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.573
Good puppy.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.679
That was the director.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.041
Looks like you scored.

15:35.167 --> 15:38.398
Well, I'd say all you need
is a helmet and an open highway.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.629
Yeah, if I don't get this thing
out on the road soon,

15:40.806 --> 15:42.774
the engine's gonna rot.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.669
You know, Suzanne,
I was gonna call you last night.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.780
It's about the guy, Kevin. I like him.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.712
Me too.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.742
I only wish Erica
were a little less hostile toward him.

15:55.921 --> 15:59.015
Yeah, I did get the impression
she's not really his biggest fan.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.489
Such a shame.
He's really a terrific guy.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.059
He treats me like a lady.

16:03.762 --> 16:06.595
He's got a good job. Did he tell you
he's an environmental chemist?

16:06.765 --> 16:09.825
- No.
- He's such a good soul.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.495
I'm just afraid
that Erica's gonna scare him off.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.264
Would you like me
to talk to her, Suzanne?

16:15.441 --> 16:18.342
Yes, that's exactly what I want.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.775
You happen to be in luck,
for that is one of my favorite pastimes.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.111
- Hey, Bran.
- Hey, Steve.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.277
I'm gonna meet up
with a couple of guys at the gym.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.888
Down for a little half-court action?

16:31.056 --> 16:32.956
No can do.
I got called in to see the chancellor.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.116
What about tonight?
We still on for the soc. Paper?

16:35.294 --> 16:36.625
Actually, I got a change of plans.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.389
I told Laura Kingman
I'd help her out with something.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.897
Laura Kingman, the girl
who almost accused you of date rape?

16:42.067 --> 16:43.898
What's the matter?
Did your pilot light go out?

16:44.069 --> 16:45.331
Hey, we're just in a study mode.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.302
And besides, I'm capable of having
a mature relationship with a girl

16:48.474 --> 16:50.635
without involving bodily functions.

16:50.809 --> 16:54.006
Steve, it's so rare I hear you use
the word "mature. " I'm impressed.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.703
Well, perhaps,
you're rubbing off on me.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.974
I don't think so.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.414
I just wanna see things go good
for this girl.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.848
She's auditioning for this play.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.387
Yeah, Brenda's auditioning for it too.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.423
- About her and a zillion other girls.
- Yeah, good luck, my brother.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.321
And hey, you watch yourself
around Laura.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.463
I'll do my best.

17:12.263 --> 17:15.290
He doesn't have a name.
He doesn't exist, does he, Maggie?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.991
He does.

17:17.169 --> 17:20.002
You can't conceive by a man
who won't sleep with you.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.605
Oh, he exists all right.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.605
And so does my child, Brick's baby.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.006
That's great, you've really got her.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.270
- Better?
- Yeah.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.437
I mean, this is my chance
to be in a great play,

17:29.615 --> 17:31.446
in a great part, with a great director.

17:31.617 --> 17:32.641
I don't wanna blow it.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.048
You won't.
You're gonna be very well-rehearsed.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.949
Well, I had help.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.421
You know, I have to say,
you read the Mae part incredibly.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.082
So what? It was fun.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.627
I guess I can play frumpy people.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.265
It's called playing against type.
You should try out.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.060
No, that's silly.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.225
I don't have the theater experience
that you do.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.663
Well, from everything that I've read
about Randolph, he likes raw talent.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.308
Besides, Mae is a small part.
You could totally handle it.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.966
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.442
And it would be terrific
to do it together, wouldn't it?

18:01.613 --> 18:02.739
Yeah.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.179
I used to love acting,
up until the sixth-grade play

18:05.350 --> 18:07.113
when I froze
in front of the whole school.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.220
You didn't have any problem
speaking to the crowd

18:09.388 --> 18:10.548
at Take Back the Night Week.

18:10.722 --> 18:11.916
You really think I could do it?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.082
Yes, and just by auditioning,

18:14.259 --> 18:16.727
you would get to meet
one of the true giants of the theater.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.627
He does sound fascinating.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.131
I think your ride's here.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.363
Hey, ladies, how's it going?

18:26.872 --> 18:29.102
We were just taking our curtain call.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.674
- So are you ready to go now?
- Yep.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.607
- I'll see you guys later.
- All right.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.911
Hey, guess what.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.242
I'm thinking of maybe trying out
for the play too.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.942
There's a small part and Brenda thinks
maybe I should try for it.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.348
What, you?

18:42.521 --> 18:43.715
You don't think I could do it?

18:43.889 --> 18:44.913
Oh, quite the contrary,

18:45.090 --> 18:47.285
I think you can do
anything you set your mind to.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.223
I'm just glad you and Bren
are getting along.

18:50.395 --> 18:51.987
Me too.

18:52.731 --> 18:55.222
<i>Chancellor Arnold,
Brandon Walsh is here to see you.</i>

18:55.400 --> 18:57.095
Send him in.

19:00.606 --> 19:01.630
Good morning.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.707
Brandon, good to see you. Sit.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.470
Thanks. Is something the matter?

19:06.645 --> 19:07.703
No.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.849
Well, maybe yes.

19:11.016 --> 19:15.578
It seems the Department of Education
has done a paper on our task force.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.722
You mean,
they're actually taking us seriously?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.084
Apparently.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.953
I haven't read it, but...

19:23.262 --> 19:25.423
Daddy, I was just wondering
when we're leaving?

19:25.597 --> 19:27.258
We're supposed to be at the museum
at noon.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.400
Very soon.
You remember Brandon, don't you?

19:29.568 --> 19:30.694
From the retreat?

19:30.869 --> 19:32.393
Oh, right. Hi.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.095
Hi, Clare.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.741
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.773
Anyway, Brandon, as I was saying,

19:38.944 --> 19:41.378
it's important for us to know
how we're perceived.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.710
I want you to digest that report
and give me a critique quickly.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.742
No problem, I've got my house
to myself for the next couple days,

19:47.920 --> 19:49.080
so I'll get right on it.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.449
I was hoping you'd say that.
Have a splendid day.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.284
Thank you, sir. You too.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.535
Bye.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.336
Brick, how long
does it have to go on?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.411
This punishment?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.309
Haven't I done enough time?

20:16.481 --> 20:18.073
Can't I apply for a pardon?

20:18.250 --> 20:21.151
Oh, Maggie,
you're spoiling my liquor.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.318
Lately, your voice always sounds
like you'd been running upstairs

20:24.489 --> 20:27.151
to warn somebody
the house is on fire.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.291
Well, no wonder.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.088
You know what I feel like?

20:34.600 --> 20:39.128
I feel all the time
like a cat on a hot tin roof.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.101
Well, maybe you should get a lover.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.470
I can't see any man but you.

20:46.812 --> 20:47.904
Easy, Laura.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.346
Even with my eyes closed,
I just see you.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.545
Why don't you get ugly, Brick?

20:55.721 --> 20:58.781
Why don't you please get fat,
or ugly, or something

20:58.957 --> 21:00.584
so I could stand it?

21:01.893 --> 21:03.622
And that's when Maggie
kisses Brick.

21:03.795 --> 21:07.026
That's when Brick resists it.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.826
It says right here on the script.

21:09.001 --> 21:13.461
Oh, sorry. No, as Maggie, I just wanted
to see what it would be like.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.199
Well, it's good, it's a strong choice.
It works for the character.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.240
So how am I doing?

21:18.410 --> 21:21.140
Great. You're getting better
with every scene.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.374
Thanks to my coach.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.314
Well, it's my pleasure, Miss Maggie.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.890
- Hey, Andrea, it's Donna and David.
- And Rocky II.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.495
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.695
Rocky, you know better than that.
I'm sorry, Andrea.

21:45.871 --> 21:49.807
Oh, no, it's the most excitement
I've had in days.

21:49.975 --> 21:50.999
He sure is frisky.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.701
Yeah, he's a four-legged
Prozac moment.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.710
He's just a happy puppy.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.873
Well, he'd be a lot easier to take around
if you taught him some discipline.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.451
Well, he's still young,
he doesn't know all the rules yet.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.918
So, what, until then,
he's just gonna tear our house apart?

22:04.089 --> 22:06.182
Look, let's save this till we get home.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.986
Parenting problems, huh?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.425
I guess this is what we have
in store for us, huh, Andrea?

22:11.596 --> 22:13.587
Well, I agree with Donna.
He's just a baby.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.824
He'll get manners
when he needs some.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.561
Gee, I wish I could stay,
but constitutional law is calling.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.170
Bye, my love.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.603
- Bye, my love.
- Bye.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.571
Be home for dinner.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.302
Hey, hey, hey.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.240
Rocky, that wasn't very nice.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.882
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

22:32.050 --> 22:35.042
Oh, well, actually, we came by
to give you something special.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.916
It's Jackie's clothes, Kelly got them.
Here, try one on.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.223
Oh, these are adorable.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.826
They're just like all the baby-doll
dresses we're all wearing.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.928
Jackie says they fit
all throughout her pregnancy.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.223
I'm gonna try it on.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.726
- Can you just help me in the back?
- Yeah.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.426
There.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.703
Oh, it's a little too tight.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.171
These things aren't gonna fit.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.941
Well, it doesn't matter
what you look like.

23:05.117 --> 23:09.713
The important thing is, you have
a really big baby inside of you.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.856
I hate this. I just have to stop eating.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.517
It's okay.

23:37.983 --> 23:39.177
Good luck.

23:43.388 --> 23:44.878
Good afternoon.

23:45.056 --> 23:47.149
I'm Roy Randolph.

23:47.526 --> 23:51.053
And I'm heartened to see
so many eager faces here.

23:51.229 --> 23:53.629
This may look to you like a cattle call,
but I can assure you,

23:53.799 --> 23:55.232
you will not be treated like cattle.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.698
We're planning on having
a good day here, aren't we, Eddie?

23:57.869 --> 24:00.895
For me, any day
above ground is a good day.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.900
Eddie's been my stage manager
for many years,

24:04.075 --> 24:06.635
and a Broadway fixture for decades.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.076
But before any of you
starts getting too nervous,

24:09.247 --> 24:11.078
please, I want to assure you,

24:11.249 --> 24:14.707
these auditions will be free
of your usual drama-club politics.

24:14.886 --> 24:19.220
I don't care who you are
or what you've done before.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.790
Everyone's got a chance.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.127
Please, cross and get your number.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.562
Kelly Taylor.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.366
All I ask is for you to be patient.

24:35.540 --> 24:38.373
It's gonna be a long process
to give everyone a fair shot.

24:38.543 --> 24:42.206
So with that understood, let's begin.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.611
Numbers one to five, follow me.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.720
I didn't think
that you were gonna make it.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.219
I couldn't decide what to wear.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.057
Do you see that girl
that Steve's with?

24:54.226 --> 24:57.320
- Isn't that...?
- My God, it is, that's Laura Kingman.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.397
Well, they certainly seem
to have patched things up.

25:00.565 --> 25:04.399
Well, she's definitely bent enough
to be a Maggie.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.733
All I know is that everybody here
looks a lot more theatrical than I do.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.569
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.007
And sometimes, it's better to be last.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.579
Well, I brought my psych book
to pass the time.

25:16.748 --> 25:19.308
I didn't know that Roy Randolph
was so cute.

25:19.484 --> 25:20.849
Oh, yes.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.180
And you know,
he has a thing for his actresses.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.379
Really?

25:24.556 --> 25:25.648
Yes, he is known for saying:

25:25.824 --> 25:28.759
"All I need out of life
is a rehearsal studio and a bedroom,

25:28.927 --> 25:30.394
preferably attached. "

25:37.202 --> 25:39.136
Coming.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.503
- Clare.
- Can I come in?

25:45.243 --> 25:49.043
- Sure.
- Oh, this is such a comfy room.

25:49.781 --> 25:53.512
So, what's going on?

25:53.685 --> 25:55.619
What's it look like, silly?

25:55.787 --> 25:57.220
It's my overnight bag.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.183
Clare, wait a second...

26:02.994 --> 26:05.428
I didn't want you to be all alone.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.794
Well, thanks,
but you can't stay here.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.992
Well, I have nowhere else to go.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.895
I mean, my father's out of town,

26:14.072 --> 26:16.165
and he thinks I'm staying over
at a friend's, so...

26:16.341 --> 26:18.070
So why aren't you there?

26:19.611 --> 26:21.010
What's the rush?

26:27.819 --> 26:29.150
What do you have in this bag?

26:30.555 --> 26:32.546
Everything I'm into.

26:32.724 --> 26:37.286
Sex, rock, really decent literature.
You?

26:37.462 --> 26:39.794
I'm into finishing the report
for your father.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.092
And that's gonna take me all night.

26:43.768 --> 26:47.329
That's no problem, just go right ahead.
I'm not gonna bug you.

26:48.540 --> 26:52.806
Look, Clare,
this just isn't gonna work.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.007
Fine. Why don't you just, like,
throw me out on the street, okay?

26:56.181 --> 26:57.876
I'll hitch down to the beach.

26:58.049 --> 27:01.541
Probably get
in some rotted-out muscle car

27:01.720 --> 27:02.846
with a bunch of deviants,

27:03.021 --> 27:05.285
but, hey, whatever, you know,
it's okay.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.515
Oh, that's not gonna happen

27:06.691 --> 27:08.852
because I'm driving you over
to your friend's.

27:09.027 --> 27:12.861
Well, they're not gonna be back
until after 10.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.658
They went to a movie.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.401
Call if you want, okay?

27:23.708 --> 27:25.403
Am I repulsive or something?

27:31.683 --> 27:35.278
No, no, not at all.

27:35.854 --> 27:38.982
It's just I kind of feel I owe it
to your father

27:39.157 --> 27:41.819
to keep a little distance here.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.358
Brandon, it's not like
I'm under surveillance, you know.

27:49.167 --> 27:54.230
Okay, you can stay down here
by yourself till you get bored.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.203
But if 10:00 rolls around before that,

27:56.374 --> 27:59.309
you are going
to your friend's house, okay?

27:59.477 --> 28:01.069
Okay.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.100
Well, if it isn't my favorite
little bookworm.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.599
You reading those books I got you?

28:24.769 --> 28:28.296
<i>Yeah, my favorite
is The Unsolved Lincoln Murder Case.</i>

28:28.473 --> 28:30.600
It's the one
that claims William Seward,

28:30.775 --> 28:32.834
the secretary of state, is behind it.

28:33.011 --> 28:34.945
I see, well,
it sounds like a good scandal.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.671
I'm gonna have to read that
sometime.

28:36.848 --> 28:38.611
You should.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.148
So why'd you wanna see me?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.813
It's about Kevin, right?

28:44.222 --> 28:47.316
Sometimes I forget
how sharp you can be.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.517
Yeah, it's about Kevin.

28:49.694 --> 28:52.663
I met him, and although
I don't know him very well,

28:52.831 --> 28:55.095
he seems okay, I like him.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.427
I think you would too
if you give him half a chance.

28:57.602 --> 28:59.399
Doubt it.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.163
Well, has he ever done
anything mean to you?

29:02.340 --> 29:03.773
No, of course not.

29:03.942 --> 29:05.933
Then, what's the problem?

29:07.011 --> 29:09.571
He reminds me of Lewis Payne.

29:10.815 --> 29:12.077
Lewis Payne?

29:12.250 --> 29:15.447
You know,
John Wilkes Booth's getaway driver.

29:16.554 --> 29:19.546
He was good-looking,
but he had the mind of a 10-year old.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.483
Erica...

29:21.659 --> 29:24.127
I just wish Mom
didn't have to have a boyfriend.

29:25.830 --> 29:26.888
Why is that?

29:27.065 --> 29:28.589
What if they got married?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.501
He lives in Orange County.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.272
I might never get to see you again.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.805
Hey, that's not gonna happen.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.272
She's not gonna get married?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.468
Well, they just met.

29:40.645 --> 29:42.374
But nothing is gonna split us up.

29:43.148 --> 29:45.343
Wherever you go,
we're always gonna be close, all right?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.542
I'm not gonna lose
the only little sister I've got.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.614
Yeah, I guess
I just needed to hear that.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.280
Then do me a favor, will you?
Cut Kevin some slack?

29:57.328 --> 30:00.263
Well, I'm gonna get me
a choice one.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.729
And I don't care
how much she costs.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.960
I'm going to strip her naked,

30:05.136 --> 30:09.368
and smother her in minks,
and choke her in diamonds.

30:10.441 --> 30:13.171
Well, at least he's got the size
to play Big Daddy.

30:13.845 --> 30:18.373
I'll strip her naked,
and choke her with...

30:19.150 --> 30:21.448
Smother her...

30:21.619 --> 30:22.643
Strip...

30:22.821 --> 30:24.345
Thank you very much.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.422
Couldn't I just have
a second chance?

30:26.591 --> 30:28.252
It's my experience
that second chances

30:28.426 --> 30:31.657
are never as good as the first.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.128
Feel good. You did just fine.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.826
Next.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.201
Name, please.

30:47.378 --> 30:48.709
Brenda Walsh.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.771
That's correct.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.781
I'm reading for the part of Maggie.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.182
And I'll be doing a monologue
from Act 1.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.288
Start when you're ready.

31:05.763 --> 31:11.133
Brick, I'm not trying
to whitewash my behavior.

31:13.304 --> 31:14.999
I'm no good.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.941
I don't know why people try
and pretend to be good.

31:20.411 --> 31:21.639
Nobody's good.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.172
But I'm honest.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.843
Give me credit for that,
will you, please?

31:27.018 --> 31:28.713
Mournful, graceful.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.151
She's got the fire, Eddie,
and the desperation.

31:31.322 --> 31:32.414
She's all right.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.581
You know, sometimes,
I think you agreed to this gig

31:34.759 --> 31:38.058
just so you could get close
to all these 18-year-old actresses.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.062
Skipper is dead. I'm alive.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.328
Maggie the Cat is alive. I'm alive.

31:48.773 --> 31:49.797
Hello.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.134
Hi, Steve.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.675
No, I don't wanna hear
how well Laura's audition went.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.836
Well, you've gotta give credit
where credit is due.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.276
I snuck in and I saw her.

31:57.448 --> 31:58.915
Now, I don't mean
to toot my own horn,

31:59.083 --> 32:02.246
but, buddy, I really got
her performance up to speed.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.012
Well, I'm glad
you're such a talented guy,

32:04.188 --> 32:05.985
but I'm fighting
to finish my work here.

32:06.157 --> 32:08.125
It's been a little distracting.

32:09.894 --> 32:11.259
What was that? Did you just giggle?

32:11.429 --> 32:12.726
No, I don't giggle.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.762
I belch, but I definitely do not giggle.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.457
Clare, will you get off the phone?

32:17.035 --> 32:18.332
<i>The distraction I was mentioning.</i>

32:18.503 --> 32:20.130
Clare? Is she cute?

32:20.305 --> 32:22.500
Dangerously cute.
Can't get my mind off her.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.575
She got the body of a centerfold
and the personality of a volcano.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.335
Well, give her what she wants, pal.

32:27.512 --> 32:30.970
She's the chancellor's daughter, Steve,
all I want is for her to get...

32:32.016 --> 32:33.608
I gotta go.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.422
This must be
your traveling outfit, huh?

32:47.598 --> 32:49.657
Well, that's what I came to tell you.

32:50.101 --> 32:54.561
You know that friend that Daddy thinks
I'm staying over with?

32:54.739 --> 32:57.799
Actually, she's kind of staying over
with a guy of her own.

32:58.977 --> 33:03.038
So I don't really have
anywhere to stay.

33:03.214 --> 33:05.375
Brandon, you home?

33:07.485 --> 33:09.350
Stay put.

33:13.358 --> 33:16.191
Hi, how was your audition?

33:16.361 --> 33:20.991
Oh, it was amazing.
I wouldn't have changed a thing.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.190
What was Steve doing there
with Laura Kingman?

33:23.368 --> 33:25.063
He's just helping her out.
It's no big deal.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.897
Does he know we're going
for the same part?

33:27.071 --> 33:30.040
So what? What's important
is you said your tryout went well.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.675
You're right. It absolutely did.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.203
- Although I kind of feel bad for Kelly.
- Kelly?

33:35.380 --> 33:38.508
Yeah, she was still waiting for her turn
when I finally had to leave

33:38.683 --> 33:39.980
to go feed the Levins' cats.

33:40.151 --> 33:42.415
Well, it probably just wasn't meant
to happen.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.919
You know, those cats
must be pretty hungry.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.922
Obviously, you're in a rush.
Working?

33:48.092 --> 33:49.821
Trying.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.792
- Well, call if you get lonely.
- I will.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.109
You said, "Stay put. "

34:05.276 --> 34:07.244
Yeah.

34:07.412 --> 34:08.969
That's it. You gotta go.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.638
I don't know where you're going,
but you're going.

34:11.815 --> 34:12.840
Where's the key?

34:13.016 --> 34:14.143
You won't find it in there.

34:14.719 --> 34:21.147
It's hidden on me somewhere.

34:21.324 --> 34:22.349
Try your luck.

34:24.629 --> 34:25.994
I got a better idea.

34:26.397 --> 34:30.231
You wanna spend
the night here, fine.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.060
Good night.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.234
Brandon?

34:39.976 --> 34:41.001
Next.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.083
Cover for me, Eddie.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.660
Excuse me.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.320
- Where are you going?
- Home.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.989
But you've waited so long.
You're not going to try out?

35:03.167 --> 35:06.295
No, I really have no business
being here.

35:06.471 --> 35:09.065
And actually, I was just doing this
as a favor to a friend.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.572
I see, well, maybe what you say
is true,

35:11.742 --> 35:14.233
but I've waited all day
to hear you read.

35:14.879 --> 35:15.937
You're teasing me.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.810
A little, but I'm not gonna let you go.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.281
No one ever walks out
of my auditions.

35:22.253 --> 35:25.450
I hardly have any acting experience.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.318
Well, maybe that's
what I was responding to.

35:27.492 --> 35:30.017
That certain freshness and fear.

35:30.194 --> 35:31.855
Well, you've got the fear thing right.

35:32.029 --> 35:34.896
The closer I was to auditioning,
the more I was scared to death.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.300
Look, I'm sure you have to get back
inside, but it was nice to meet you.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.937
Hold on.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.737
I really want to see you on stage.
Humor me?

35:47.245 --> 35:48.940
I really think
you're gonna be disappointed.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.411
Well, let me be the judge of that.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.979
- I'm Roy.
- Kelly Taylor.

35:55.786 --> 35:57.515
Shall we?

36:14.872 --> 36:16.533
Donna, he did it again.

36:16.707 --> 36:17.799
Where? On the paper?

36:17.975 --> 36:19.169
No, it's on the floor.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.672
Give him to me.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.611
Not if you're gonna rub his nose
in it.

36:25.783 --> 36:27.808
Donna, it's the only way
he's gonna learn.

36:27.985 --> 36:30.647
Maybe in your house, but in my house,
we just put more paper down.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.688
Okay, fine, why don't we go
wall-to-wall paper? How about that?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.621
Why don't we put plastic
on the furniture

36:35.793 --> 36:37.522
so he doesn't mistake it
for a chew toy?

36:37.695 --> 36:40.095
He'll grow out of it. He just needs
to learn at his own speed.

36:40.264 --> 36:41.288
You'll see.

36:41.465 --> 36:47.665
Here, Rocky, you go on the paper.
You see, right here, yeah.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.967
Rocky's toilet, how can I help you?

36:50.141 --> 36:51.904
<i>Hi, David, is Kelly there?</i>

36:52.076 --> 36:53.338
Yeah, she's right here, hold on.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.342
- It's Brenda.
- Thanks.

36:55.513 --> 36:56.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.579
You know, if you're tired
of living in a kennel,

36:58.749 --> 37:00.216
you can always bunk in with me.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.545
I might just do that.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.517
Sorry I didn't get back to you
last night.

37:04.689 --> 37:07.214
I got your message, but by the time
I got home from the audition,

37:07.391 --> 37:08.949
it was so late, I just crashed.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.184
But you got to try out?

37:11.429 --> 37:12.760
Good, I'm glad.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.763
Unfortunately, by the time I got
on stage, I was so nervous.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.629
But I'm glad I hung in there.
It was an interesting experience.

37:18.803 --> 37:22.295
Well, word is that there's gonna be
a list posted for callbacks

37:22.473 --> 37:23.963
around 11:00.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.735
- It will be the big cut down.
- Do you think you have a chance?

37:27.278 --> 37:29.473
Don't even ask.
I don't wanna get my hopes up.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.706
I'm gonna head over
to the campus now. Wanna meet me?

37:31.882 --> 37:36.012
I don't think so, I'm still on dream time.
But good luck, I'll be thinking of you.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.313
Okay, I'll see you later.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.285
<i>- All right.
- Bye.</i>

37:39.457 --> 37:40.924
You tell Brenda
you read for the lead?

37:41.525 --> 37:43.925
Now, please, he only did that
because he felt sorry for me

37:44.095 --> 37:46.563
- because I'd been waiting so long...
- Kel.

37:48.499 --> 37:49.989
Don't tell David, please.

37:50.801 --> 37:52.268
Sure.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.456
Are you expecting someone?

38:14.625 --> 38:18.959
Yeah, my cab. School time.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.332
So I guess
I've been saved by the bell.

38:24.068 --> 38:27.595
You didn't happen to molest me
while I was sleeping, did you?

38:27.772 --> 38:29.899
No, I didn't.

38:30.074 --> 38:31.803
I guess it was a dream.

38:32.677 --> 38:36.943
Listen, Clare, normally,
I'm not such a Boy Scout.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.480
But I'm afraid with you,

38:39.650 --> 38:42.619
I'll just have to say
goodbye and good luck.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.982
Well, I had fun anyway.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.592
I wanted to spend the night
with a college guy, and I did.

38:48.759 --> 38:49.783
Kind of.

38:51.562 --> 38:55.157
Anything to take the suckiness
out of a boring week.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.360
I gotta go. We'll do it again.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.964
No, we won't. I'm afraid this is it.

39:02.139 --> 39:06.235
Oh, yeah?
Or what, you'll tell my father?

39:08.245 --> 39:09.803
Goodbye.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.540
Tell him. He'll never believe you.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.910
Why are you doing this, Clare?

39:16.087 --> 39:18.851
Because I like you.

39:38.976 --> 39:42.309
Like I said, everything looks good.
The baby's really active.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.504
That is amazing.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.514
So there's nothing wrong
with the ultrasound?

39:46.684 --> 39:48.208
Nothing wrong.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.081
Normally, I wouldn't have done
one of these,

39:50.254 --> 39:51.949
but you seemed so upset.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.717
Well, thank you. I'm glad you did.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.359
- You can get dressed now.
- Thanks.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.122
And the baby's growth is on target?

40:01.499 --> 40:03.763
The size of the head
is right where it should be.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.958
What about my weight?

40:05.136 --> 40:06.433
Well, we took your fundal growth,

40:06.604 --> 40:09.573
and though it's on the high side
of the curve, it's not abnormal.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.208
A lot of women gain excessive weight
for their first pregnancy.

40:12.376 --> 40:14.606
That's exactly what I told her,
Dr. Haller.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.041
No, that is not what you said.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.773
You said that my body chemistry
is out of whack.

40:18.949 --> 40:22.214
Just try and relax. By next month,
you'll be ready for Lamaze.

40:22.386 --> 40:24.581
We're looking forward to that.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.781
Well, what about my family history
of diabetes?

40:27.958 --> 40:29.255
Couldn't there be complications?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.452
We've been on top of it
right from the beginning.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.927
You have nothing to worry about.

40:34.398 --> 40:35.922
Great.

40:36.634 --> 40:39.330
Cheer up. I'll see you before you go.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.993
Thanks, doc.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.833
Thank you.

40:44.542 --> 40:46.373
You think I'm just crying wolf,
don't you?

40:46.544 --> 40:48.535
No, no, I don't.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.543
It's just that we have
to get a grip on things.

40:50.714 --> 40:53.581
Ultrasounds are very expensive.
Insurance is only gonna cover so many.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.151
Fine.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.923
Thousands of women
have babies every day.

41:01.091 --> 41:02.786
Jesse, I'm not thousands of women.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.259
Look, this is my body. Call it
mother's instinct, whatever you want.

41:06.430 --> 41:10.730
I know something's wrong.
I can just feel it.

41:18.776 --> 41:19.800
Thank you, Dylan.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.275
Whatever you said to Erica,
boy, did it work.

41:22.446 --> 41:24.243
First time she didn't give me
the evil eye.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.212
Well, I guess she'd been doing
so much reading

41:26.383 --> 41:29.978
on the conspiracy theory,
that her mind was a little tangled.

41:30.154 --> 41:34.250
<i>So next time, I'll give her the complete
set of The Baby-sitters Club.</i>

41:34.959 --> 41:36.893
Hey, look, I gotta get to work, okay?

41:37.061 --> 41:39.757
- Yeah, I better hit the beach.
- You a waterman?

41:40.364 --> 41:42.662
Dylan, didn't tell you he surfed?

41:42.833 --> 41:43.857
- You too?
- No, yeah.

41:44.034 --> 41:48.198
I mean, I'm getting older,
but I still catch my share.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.807
Thanks to a little high technology.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.876
What technology?
You got some kind of edge?

41:54.044 --> 41:58.037
Well, I just fitted this little sonar gizmo
into an old board of mine,

41:58.215 --> 41:59.546
and it really works.

41:59.717 --> 42:02.413
It measures the wave speed
and the size of the swell.

42:02.586 --> 42:06.784
It sort of takes the guesswork out of it
for the mature ripper.

42:06.957 --> 42:08.117
This I gotta see.

42:08.292 --> 42:10.351
Well, come on.
My Jeep's just across the street.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.291
Okay.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.266
Dana Point was my home beach
as a kid.

42:21.438 --> 42:23.372
Man, it was really something,

42:23.541 --> 42:25.236
before the building boom
killed the break.

42:25.409 --> 42:29.140
It must have been epic.
No pollution, no lineups.

42:29.313 --> 42:31.508
Not every day was paradise then.

42:31.682 --> 42:34.310
There were always some kind
of local hassles to get your attention.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.885
- Yeah?
- It was crazy stuff, man.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.521
I remember this one time, man.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.316
Kevin!

42:42.826 --> 42:45.317
Talk about a wipeout, man.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.123
You all right?

42:48.299 --> 42:50.096
Thanks.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.998
Hey, I don't know what I would've done
if I lost you.

42:54.171 --> 42:55.832
What would I have told Suzanne
or Erica?

42:57.374 --> 42:59.569
I'll tell you this, man.

42:59.977 --> 43:01.808
You just made a pal for life.

43:10.821 --> 43:14.188
Oh, no. I can't believe it.

43:14.358 --> 43:18.294
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

43:18.862 --> 43:20.659
Congratulations.

43:20.831 --> 43:21.923
I got called back?

43:22.566 --> 43:24.033
- Me too.
- Congratulations.

43:24.201 --> 43:26.635
Thanks,
it's down to five for the lead.

43:26.804 --> 43:28.897
You, me and Kelly Taylor
made the cut.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.007
Kelly Taylor?

43:31.175 --> 43:33.405
That's impossible.
For Maggie the Cat, are you sure?

43:33.577 --> 43:36.375
Yeah, positive, why?
Didn't you know she was going for it?

43:36.547 --> 43:37.946
She told me
she was reading for Mae.

43:38.115 --> 43:41.983
Well, this guy on the lighting crew
said that she's a natural Maggie.

43:42.152 --> 43:44.052
He heard
that she's the front-runner.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.324
Well, bye.

43:50.728 --> 43:54.129
Of course, I'm sure it didn't hurt
that she went out with Mr. Randolph

43:54.298 --> 43:55.697
for cappuccino afterwards.

43:56.266 --> 43:59.099
- What?
- You didn't know that either?

44:00.404 --> 44:02.964
Yeah, well, with friends like that,
who needs enemies?

44:04.908 --> 44:06.136
Good luck.
