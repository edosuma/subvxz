and then hang up,

14:56.729 --> 14:57.630

14:57.664 --> 15:01.401
it creates a cycle
of emotional desperation,

15:01.434 --> 15:02.402
especially
if the message says,

It wasn't until she told me
she was seeing another guy.

E, that's jealousy.
That ain't love.

42:39.124 --> 42:40.892
You think so?
Yeah.

Of course, it's jealousy.
That's what I'm saying, see?

42:42.828 --> 42:45.597
Now, why would I be jealous
if I wasn't in love?

42:45.631 --> 42:47.165

that's an aggressive
act towards men.
