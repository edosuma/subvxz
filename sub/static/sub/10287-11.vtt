-Hi. Har.
HARRY: Hi.

00:04.204 --> 00:05.734
Hi. judge-

00:08.273 --> 00:09.803
Harry. what are you doing?

00:09.973 --> 00:12.243
Trying to read that headline
from across the room.

00:12.409 --> 00:14.379
Having a little trouble with my eyes.

00:14.545 --> 00:19.235
"Woman claims man from Jupiter
fathered her child."

00:19.416 --> 00:20.706
I don't see any problem.

00:20.883 --> 00:24.723
Yeah? Wait till she tries
to collect child support.

00:24.886 --> 00:27.356
I mean Harry's eyesight seems okay.

00:27.522 --> 00:29.622
I've been getting headaches
when I read a lot.

00:29.791 --> 00:33.661
That's eyestrain. You really should go to
the doctor and have your eyes checked out.

00:33.829 --> 00:36.849
Really? Most doctors can check them
while they're still in.

00:37.431 --> 00:39.961
-Harry.
-Get it? While they're still in.

00:40.134 --> 00:41.474
[LAUGHS]

00:41.635 --> 00:44.535
Okay. okay. Fine.
You know. just make light of it.

00:44.705 --> 00:45.865
I hate to wolf and run...

00:46.039 --> 00:48.839
...but I've got an appointment
with an eye doctor.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.738
I knew you'd insist.

00:52.644 --> 00:56.674
Sir? Sir? I need you
to sign some papers here right away.

00:56.849 --> 01:02.379
-Hi. Mac.
-Here. here and both places on this one.

01:02.554 --> 01:05.794
-Just fine. thanks. And you?
-Oh. boffo. sir. Now. here's your pen.

01:06.492 --> 01:09.292
Well. that's enough chitchat for one day.
I suppose.

01:09.461 --> 01:10.551
What is this stuff. man?

01:10.729 --> 01:13.289
Oh. it's the usual red tape
in duplicate and triplicate.

01:13.465 --> 01:15.555
-Then it can wait.
-Oh. no way. Jack.

01:15.801 --> 01:16.861
Uh....

01:17.035 --> 01:19.195
I mean. uh. no way. Your Honor.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.860
The last time I signed something
without reading it...

01:22.039 --> 01:24.909
...I ended up buying
three years' worth of carpet cleaning.

01:25.076 --> 01:27.736
-But. sir--
-I have hardwood floors. Mac.

01:27.912 --> 01:31.582
Sir. all it is
is a declaration of financial non-liability...

01:31.749 --> 01:34.239
...and some kind of a form loyalty oath.

01:34.418 --> 01:35.748
-For you?
-No. no. for her.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.820
Oh. I'm sorry. this is Ouon Le Duc.

01:37.989 --> 01:39.349
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:39.523 --> 01:43.523
-And this is Judge Stone.
-The crazy one you told me about?

01:43.692 --> 01:44.852

01:45.026 --> 01:49.856
Uh-- A little language barrier. sir.
You see. Ouon Le is from Vietnam.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.360
-I like your dress.
-Oh. thanks.

01:53.267 --> 01:56.827
It's your basic black. You know.
no problem getting accessories or anything.

01:57.004 --> 01:59.414
Sir. if you don't mind.
we need these papers signed.

01:59.573 --> 02:02.443
The folks in Immigration
are determined to bounce her out...

02:02.609 --> 02:05.769
...unless I'm able to get our paperwork
squared away by midnight.

02:05.946 --> 02:09.536
Midnight? Mac. this is a little sticky.
I mean. I don't even know the woman.

02:09.716 --> 02:12.776
I'll vouch for her. sir. I knew her family
when I was back in Nam.

02:12.953 --> 02:15.293
And you'll vouch
that everything in there is true?

02:15.455 --> 02:17.385
On my mother's grave. sir.

02:17.891 --> 02:20.051
Your mother's still alive. Mac.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.430
Isn't that wonderful. sir?

02:25.063 --> 02:27.763
I don't think I wanna hear any more.

02:27.933 --> 02:32.843
Oh. thank you. Your Honor.
You know. you are a real humanitarian.

02:33.004 --> 02:34.904
Yeah. that's what
the carpet salesman said too.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.398
Come on. let's go.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.130
Mac. got a second?

02:41.312 --> 02:44.042
-No. no.
-Come on. I just wanna ask you a question.

02:44.214 --> 02:48.584
-Where have you been hiding this one?
-She's Ouon Le Duc. She's from Vietnam.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.052
Vietnam? Hi. I'm Dan Fielding...

02:51.220 --> 02:54.780
...very possibly the next president
of the United States.

02:55.158 --> 02:59.488
Oh. yes. Dan Fielding. the animal painter.

03:00.463 --> 03:01.693
Animal painter?

03:01.863 --> 03:05.933
Mac says you're the best bull artist
in the city.

03:07.836 --> 03:11.856
-He's too kind.
-We gotta run. Bye.

03:16.178 --> 03:18.908
-Hey. who's that girl?
-Friend of Mac's. She's cute. huh?

03:19.081 --> 03:22.541
She has a cute name too: Ouon Le Duc.

03:22.718 --> 03:24.738

03:27.687 --> 03:31.057

No. no. No K. just D-U-C. Yes. Right.

04:25.178 --> 04:28.108
I know that the senator
would wanna do all he can to help out...

04:28.281 --> 04:31.251
...since I'm a major contributor
to his campaign.

04:31.417 --> 04:34.317
Yes. this is Mr. Xerox speaking.

04:36.054 --> 04:37.544

04:40.257 --> 04:43.017
-Harry not back from the eye doctor. huh?
-Nope.

The crowd is abuzz with anticipation.

04:47.197 --> 04:49.057
That's wheezing.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.567
Of course. I don't blame them.

at the opening of every session.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.311
Sure. Where else would they be?

-Your Honor. everything okay?
-Oh. fine.

05:31.207 --> 05:33.837
Why don't you fellas
come around to the front?

05:36.712 --> 05:39.482
Or that would be another solution.

05:40.249 --> 05:43.339
-What's the matter with your eyes?
-Nothing. Just a routine exam.

05:43.519 --> 05:46.049
Doctor put a few drops in my eyes
to relax the muscles.

05:46.222 --> 05:49.822
It's a common procedure. The effects
should wear off in a couple of hours.

05:49.992 --> 05:54.192
Oh. a couple of hours? Well. great. Maybe
we should call a recess until. say. oh...

05:54.363 --> 05:55.393
...midnight.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.974
Mac. I'm sorry.
but I'm afraid I'm gonna be just fine.

05:59.134 --> 06:01.034
Now. I know you have
a lot on your mind...

06:01.202 --> 06:04.902
...but I really think the best thing
is just to call the first case.

06:05.072 --> 06:08.042
Eugene Sleighbough. attempted burglary.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.968
The people acknowledge...

06:10.143 --> 06:13.943
...that there may be a special circumstance
where Mr. Sleighbough is concerned.

06:14.113 --> 06:17.283
-Special in what way?
-I'm invisible.

06:20.653 --> 06:22.853
Who said that?

06:23.723 --> 06:25.523
See what I mean?

06:25.691 --> 06:27.561
Your Honor. that was my client speaking.

06:27.727 --> 06:30.197
He believes
that he's invisible to other humans.

06:30.363 --> 06:33.703
-Is that so. Mr. Sleighbough?
-You can't see me. can you?

06:33.866 --> 06:35.456
Oh. well. certainly I can.

06:35.834 --> 06:40.364
Oh. Okay.
How many fingers am I holding up?

Amazing how the other senses take over.
isn't it?

06:53.449 --> 06:56.609
Yeah. Well. I understand. Mm-hm.

06:57.887 --> 07:02.047
-Mac. we are trying to conduct a trial here.
-Oh. I'm sorry. sir. but it's about Ouon Le.

07:02.225 --> 07:05.625
I got some people working on the problem.
and I'm just about out of time.

07:05.794 --> 07:09.134
Mac. I sympathize. Really. I do.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.288
But I'm gonna have to ask you
to silence the bell on that phone.

07:12.467 --> 07:16.127
If I turn off the bell. how am I gonna know
when important calls are coming in?

07:16.305 --> 07:18.095
You'll think of something.

-Now. to the matter at hand.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.749
Well. rather than wasting time
reading all this...

07:34.921 --> 07:39.421
...perhaps the prosecutor
could summarize the proceeding.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.293
Hello.

-Yes. sir.
HARRY: Mr. Prosecutor.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.460
Yes. Your Honor. it seems as though...

07:48.635 --> 07:51.695
...that Mr. Sleighbough tried
to take advantage of his condition...

07:51.872 --> 07:55.372
...by robbing a fifth-story apartment
in the middle of the afternoon.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.312
Yeah. It's perfect for me.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.067
See. I can slip in and out
completely unnoticed.

08:00.246 --> 08:04.376
Except for the several hundred people
who saw you inching along the ledge.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.483
Ah. That was probably a fluke.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.492
See. they probably used
some kind of heat-sensing device.

08:09.655 --> 08:13.175
Yes. It's called sunlight.

08:13.359 --> 08:17.319
Your Honor. if I may. it seems to me th--

08:17.563 --> 08:21.563
My client is having a little problem
with reality. Don't!

08:21.733 --> 08:24.173
Mr. Sleighbough.
when did you first discover...

08:24.335 --> 08:28.795
-...you had this talent to become invisible?
-Well. it came on sort of gradual.

08:29.407 --> 08:34.277
See. at first. I was just boring.
but then I became inconspicuous.

08:34.445 --> 08:36.775
-Oh.
-I'd be waiting in a doctor's office...

08:36.948 --> 08:40.818
...or a restaurant or a barbershop. you
know. whatever. and. finally. they'd say:

08:40.985 --> 08:42.705
"Oh. I didn't see you there."

08:42.885 --> 08:45.506
That's when it first began to take hold.

08:45.923 --> 08:48.593
-And now?
-I'm fully invisible.

08:48.759 --> 08:51.489
I can be standing on a corner
yelling and waving my arms...

08:51.662 --> 08:54.792
...cabbies. they go right by.
never even notice me.

08:54.965 --> 08:57.225

Miss Young.
does your client have any priors?

08:59.636 --> 09:02.626
No. Your Honor. but it's right there
in the arresting officer's report.

09:02.806 --> 09:06.366
Ah. Yes. which I should have here.

09:06.877 --> 09:09.777
-Mac?
-He's not at his desk. Your Honor.

09:09.947 --> 09:14.277
-Well. where is he?
-I'll go out on a limb and say elsewhere.

09:14.451 --> 09:15.751
Someone go out and find him.

whenever he wants to.

for a little huddle. please?

Ooh.

this one over for a psychiatric evaluation.

12:48.379 --> 12:50.309
How about Kansas?

12:50.982 --> 12:55.082
Too crowded now. It's the high season.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.590
Ouon Le....

12:57.755 --> 13:01.015
Hey. hey. I got a great idea.
What say we all go out after work...

13:01.192 --> 13:04.032
...have some beer. sandwiches.
and celebrate...

13:04.195 --> 13:07.455
...and then me and you can come back here
and file for divorce?

13:09.032 --> 13:14.102
-Divorce? You've been married 10 minutes.
-Nothing lasts forever.

13:14.471 --> 13:16.771
Mac. why you say this to me now?

13:16.939 --> 13:20.669
Ouon Le. now. you know I only married you
so you could stay in this country.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.873
-You did?
-Sure.

13:22.044 --> 13:25.244
It'll take about a week to file your papers.
and then you'll be safe.

13:25.414 --> 13:28.714
We get a divorce.
and Immigration is none the wiser.

13:28.884 --> 13:31.254
Mac. there is a judge in this room.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.980
Oh. you're blind. sir.
You can't swear that it's me.

13:35.991 --> 13:38.151
BY golly. you're right.

13:38.593 --> 13:41.223
Mac. didn't you tell her
why you were marrying her?

13:41.396 --> 13:44.256
-well--
-There really wasn't much time to tell her.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.462
Well. no--

13:45.633 --> 13:49.093
Time? How much time do you need
to tell somebody why you're marrying them?

13:49.270 --> 13:50.970
-You need--
-It's not that simple.

13:51.139 --> 13:53.869
I mean. there was something else
pretty important at stake.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.812
-Yes. Yes. it--
-Oh. yeah?

13:55.977 --> 13:58.707
Well. what's more important
than a broken heart?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.175
Well. tell her.

14:03.017 --> 14:04.507
You don't love me.

14:05.086 --> 14:07.946
Well. not in the sense
of matrimony-type love. no.

14:08.122 --> 14:11.152
But I loved you enough as a human being
that I wanted to help.

14:11.325 --> 14:13.445
So that is the only reason
you married me?

14:13.627 --> 14:15.357
Because I am a human being?

14:15.528 --> 14:19.728
I had a couple of husbands
who didn't meet that standard.

14:19.899 --> 14:22.369
It was the only way
I could keep you in this country.

14:22.535 --> 14:25.365
If that's all it was.
I'd rather have gone back.

14:28.507 --> 14:30.167
Yoo-hoo.

14:31.409 --> 14:33.039
Gotcha.

14:33.478 --> 14:36.498
These candid shots
are great for weddings.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.170
You violated me.

14:38.349 --> 14:41.439
-I what?
-Hold that pose.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.850
Marriage is something that is sacred
to me and my people.

14:46.023 --> 14:48.963
It is not permitted
to play with someone's heart in this way.

14:49.126 --> 14:50.816
Could you two get a little closer?

14:50.995 --> 14:54.685
-Hey. I didn't play with anybody's heart.
BULL: Perfect.

14:55.064 --> 14:58.564
Bull. this is really not the time to be--

14:58.735 --> 15:00.665
I felt that.

15:01.104 --> 15:03.404
-Look. look. we'll figure something out.
-No.

15:03.572 --> 15:05.902
There is only one way out.

15:06.074 --> 15:10.034
As is the ancient custom
of the one who has been dishonored...

15:10.212 --> 15:13.652
...I will starve myself to death.

15:14.082 --> 15:16.812
I'd better go cancel that cake. then.

15:17.853 --> 15:21.883
-Now. Ouon Le. starving yourself is--
-Leave me alone. you....

15:29.431 --> 15:31.631
Ouon Le. wait.

15:32.901 --> 15:34.671
Oh. boy. I feel so sorry for her.

15:34.836 --> 15:38.356
Yeah. They both must be
pretty torn up inside.

It's not easy. I can tell you that.

15:42.678 --> 15:45.978
I know. I've been there myself.

15:47.616 --> 15:50.306
You were married?

15:50.652 --> 15:52.452

Dan. I never knew that about you.

15:57.059 --> 15:58.459
Yeah.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.388
It was a gambling cruise to the Bahamas.

16:02.564 --> 16:04.334
Her name was Kimberly...

16:04.499 --> 16:06.089
...something.

16:08.169 --> 16:10.869

to marry us. and she fell for it.

-You wanna do it over dinner?
-No.

16:46.602 --> 16:50.442
There is nothing for you to do
but wait for me to die of starvation.

16:50.605 --> 16:53.725
Oh. Ouon Le. please. look at me.

16:57.212 --> 17:01.482
I thought you understood that
the whole marriage was just a subterfuge.

17:01.649 --> 17:04.979
-What is that?
-Well. it means a kind of an evasion.

I'm sorry if you thought
the wedding meant more than it did.

When I was a young girl in Vietnam...

18:04.211 --> 18:06.981
...you were the only man I had
to look up to.

-Well. what were you. 10. 12?
-Something like that.

18:14.021 --> 18:17.251
But even then. I knew you were special.

18:17.424 --> 18:20.394
Oh.
All I did was help your family out a little.

18:20.560 --> 18:26.260
Yes. and you were helpful. And kind.
And fun. And compassionate.

-Heh-heh-heh.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.468

Of course. when a man like you
comes into a girl's life...

18:37.875 --> 18:40.635

18:47.583 --> 18:50.783
Mac? Good news.
I talked to a friend at Immigration.

18:50.953 --> 18:53.823
He said you can get your marriage annulled
no problem.

18:54.223 --> 18:57.283
Say. that is great news.

18:57.459 --> 19:02.229
Ouon Le. annulment means
that the marriage never existed...

19:02.397 --> 19:06.057
...you were not dishonored.
and you don't have to starve yourself.

19:06.835 --> 19:09.095
I'm sorry, guys,
it's the best we could do.

19:09.872 --> 19:13.042

19:27.189 --> 19:29.619
If you wanna stay married. Heh.

19:29.791 --> 19:33.091
I cannot be married
with someone who does not love me.

19:33.262 --> 19:37.172
You can't go back.
The new regime will peg you as a spy.

fingerprints and maybe even your fingers.
