- Hello, Father.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.539
What have we there?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.808
Everything, Mrs Sadler, absolutely everything.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.249
You gave me Kira's stem cells?

00:18.318 --> 00:20.309
This is my decision and not yours!

00:20.387 --> 00:22.912
There is no decision, Cosima,
you have one way forward and this is it.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.218

00:24.324 --> 00:26.087
Kira might be her only chance.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.524
Will this help? My tooth?

00:27.594 --> 00:31.052
I give you Duncan, you give up on Kira,
and we disappear once and for all.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.028
You destroyed us with the spying and the lies.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.299
Rachel, is it done?

00:39.406 --> 00:41.033
- It's in motion.
- Wait for...

Go now.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.205

Not feds either, in $400 shoes.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.787

be in the morgue right now.

She called out of the blue, buddy.
I didn't tell her nothing.

She wanted you because you're... Ah!

26:08.734 --> 26:10.827
What's with her dick? Hmm?

26:11.203 --> 26:12.966
Creative license, nothing more.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.772
Care to tell me what the hell's going on here, Felix?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.909
Depends, Tony. You gonna tell me
what Beth's message is?

26:22.714 --> 26:23.703
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

26:32.057 --> 26:36.118
(IN HELIUM-INDUCED VOICE)
I am helium and I'm way funnier than...

26:39.164 --> 26:40.654
Oh, my God.

26:40.799 --> 26:44.428
- Helium is way funnier than polonium.
- It is, oh my God, it is!

26:54.046 --> 26:55.809
Is the helium voice gone now?

26:55.914 --> 26:58.883
Uh... Yes. It is.

26:59.184 --> 27:03.746
Good, because there's something
important I want to tell you.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.285
(SOFTLY)
<i>Je t'aime.</i>

27:10.696 --> 27:14.530
Is that why you didn't tell me
that they were Kira's stem cells?

27:16.034 --> 27:17.058
Yes.

27:17.169 --> 27:21.902
Is that why even before I got here
you gave Dr. Leekie my blood samples?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.632
Even though I told you not to.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.468
Cosima...

27:27.479 --> 27:28.639
It's your life.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.612
It's not just that.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.384
It's all of us.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.878
You have to love all of us.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.222
Then I love all of you.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.082
(SIGHS)

27:42.528 --> 27:43.517
Good.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.562
'Cause if you betray us again,

27:47.633 --> 27:49.533
I have enough dirt on you to destroy your career.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.607
And I love you too.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.611
(BOTH LAUGHING)

28:05.517 --> 28:07.917
I don't know. I don't know.
I feel like someone

28:07.986 --> 28:09.453
pulled the planet out from under me.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.955
Yeah. That's good, keep going.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.584
I thought I was doing something
worthwhile, a sociological study.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.328
(SIGHING)
I feel so stupid.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.031
Mmm-hmm.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.058
Goddamn Leekie.

28:25.237 --> 28:28.604
With his big, stupid face.

28:28.974 --> 28:31.807
Sneaking doctors in here, examining you.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.602
My own sweet wife!

28:34.680 --> 28:39.845
I understand "furious" darling.
Being humiliated by

28:41.687 --> 28:44.053
unspoken things.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.992
I have to confess something about

28:50.562 --> 28:51.893
Aynsley's accident.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.264
(INAUDIBLE)

29:08.680 --> 29:10.511
Please don't think I'm horrible.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.316
I killed Dr. Leekie.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.893
You are killing me now.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.158
How come you have a friggin' painting with my face on it?

29:27.366 --> 29:28.355
Eh?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.765
I want to tell you. It's not my place.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.167
Right. Right.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.296
You know, my buddy Sammy,

29:34.406 --> 29:37.170
he didn't give a shit what was going on between my legs.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.734
He just saw me.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.142
All right? And he sends me here
with some freakin' message

29:42.247 --> 29:44.340
and you're not gonna explain to me why?

29:45.751 --> 29:48.743
It's just 30 minutes, all right?

29:48.887 --> 29:50.752
I've given you all friggin' night, man.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.289
I will tell you everything, if you just wait.

29:54.359 --> 29:55.417
Bullshit.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.593
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.062
- Get out of my way.
- Tony!

30:01.633 --> 30:02.759
Tony...

30:06.838 --> 30:08.362
- Whoa.
- Shite.

30:08.907 --> 30:09.999
Tony, this is Sarah.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.174
Your sister.

30:17.949 --> 30:21.077
Never had to do this with one of our own before.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.253
Cosima's sort ofjumped me into the whole clone thing.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.881
- Sarah?
- Yep?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.386
Shut your yap for a second.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.520
Sure.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.397
Jesus Christ.

30:33.865 --> 30:34.854
(SC0FFS)

30:37.235 --> 30:41.433
My mom always said that they made a
mistake down at the IVF clinic, but...

30:42.040 --> 30:43.098
Shit.

30:43.408 --> 30:44.500
You all right, mate?

30:45.277 --> 30:46.505
It's a lot to take in.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.071
Yep. Yeah.

30:49.314 --> 30:50.872
Look at us, we're hot.

30:53.318 --> 30:54.444
Damn, girl.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.778
Not our usual identity crisis.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.022
I did all that work a long time ago.

31:01.593 --> 31:05.120
There's only one Tony, and you're not me, sucker.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.855
Guess this is the new guy.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.994
- Hmm.
- Yeah, damn right.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.262
Let's cut the shit.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.573
All right? I got a message and
I want to know who they were.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.305
- "They"?
- Them.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.609
All right? The suits who
ambushed me and Sammy.

31:21.613 --> 31:26.243
Sammy was ex-military, so a lot of our
jobs came from his old army contacts.

31:26.451 --> 31:27.475
What's the message?

31:30.956 --> 31:32.184
Sammy's exact words.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.593
"Tell Beth, 'Keep the faith.

31:36.628 --> 31:41.031
"'Paul's like me. He's on it.
He's a ghost."'

31:41.433 --> 31:42.661
A ghost?

31:43.001 --> 31:45.231
- That's it?
- Yeah, then he died.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.064
Sorry.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.100
Paul.

31:57.849 --> 32:02.684
No trace? No travel alerts,
no digital trail? Paul's disappeared?

32:03.522 --> 32:04.511
Keep looking.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.958
Professor Duncan.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.325
Hello again. Rachel.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.556
I'm so relieved we could arrange this.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.223
Would you like some tea?

32:17.569 --> 32:19.161
Oh, yes, please, my dear.

32:19.404 --> 32:20.769
Um, with lemon?

32:25.277 --> 32:28.337
I feel I must apologise for our last meeting.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.814
I was overly emotional.

32:31.316 --> 32:33.341
Well, we both were, my dear.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.977
It was a day I'd dreamt of for 20 years.

32:36.588 --> 32:37.577
Well, I have not.

32:38.924 --> 32:42.382
Our relationship must
remain... professional.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.826
For all concerned.

32:46.164 --> 32:49.964
Do you remember I used to read you
<i>The Island of Doctor Moreau?</i>

32:52.437 --> 32:53.461
Yes.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.473
How does it go... Umm, the bit about

32:57.576 --> 33:00.238
how he'd be forgiven for hate

33:01.613 --> 33:03.843
but not for irresponsibility.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.910
I don't recall.

33:07.919 --> 33:08.908
Why?

33:09.054 --> 33:13.491
I hope you can forgive me for being
glad that Aldous Leekie is dead.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.722
Of course.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.594
DONNIE: Oh!

33:24.035 --> 33:26.902
Umm, I'm pretty sure he crapped himself.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.033
Oh, Donnie.

33:30.308 --> 33:32.367
I'm sorry, I was gonna take him with me.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.647
That's the director of the Dyad Institute.

33:39.784 --> 33:43.914
He just got in and I whacked him.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.151
I didn't even mean to.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.522
- Oh, God.
- Okay, just relax, Donnie.

33:49.127 --> 33:50.754
It's not at all well-wrapped.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.357
You're worried about the trunk?

33:53.431 --> 33:54.523
Yes!

33:54.833 --> 33:58.360
I'm gonna make a new liner. And I hope
that you threw the weapon in the lake.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.435
I put it back in your gun locker.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.866
(SHOUTS)
You used my gun!

34:06.044 --> 34:10.481
This message is like Sammy's trying
to reassure Beth about Paul.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.047
They're both military. I mean,
what the hell does that mean?

34:13.118 --> 34:15.518
I don"t know.
Leekie's gone, Paul's AWOL.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.851
- Enjoy it.
- Is he gonna be all right?

34:19.157 --> 34:22.888
Yeah. But he's got
some of your worst qualities.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.199
You're the very best of us.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.393
I know.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.632
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.438
- Be safe.
- (SCOFFS)

34:44.049 --> 34:45.208
Do you want another whiskey?

34:45.850 --> 34:47.681
(EXHALING)
I've got sisters.

34:48.186 --> 34:49.483
That you do, Tony.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.143
That you do.

34:53.123 --> 34:56.150
You know what? I think I'd get along
with dreadlocks over there, but...

34:57.094 --> 34:59.188
That one with the soccer ball looks like a douche.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.321
(CHUCKLES)

35:00.398 --> 35:01.797
She's a functional alcoholic.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.025
But she's not that bad.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.227
Lucky for you,

35:06.805 --> 35:08.773
we need to keep you away from all this.

35:10.475 --> 35:11.703
For now.

35:18.717 --> 35:22.653
These are items I need to begin
unlocking the synthetic sequences.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.384
- A floppy disk drive?
- Well, I only claim the road map.

35:28.526 --> 35:30.960
Coordinates, entirely low-tech.

35:31.096 --> 35:33.997
Once you've located them, Cosima has unlimited resources.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.127
Ah. But the child is still
the prize, isn't she?

35:39.838 --> 35:40.964
Little Kira.

35:42.607 --> 35:44.074
Answer me this, Professor.

35:46.711 --> 35:47.871
Why Sarah?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.239
Of all of us.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.880
How is it the unmonitored tramp was successful?

35:54.886 --> 35:55.910
In her fertility?

35:56.254 --> 36:00.020
Huh! Rachel, she's a failure,
not a success.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.760
You are all barren by design.

36:11.770 --> 36:16.798
I supposed you couldn <i>'</i> t have created
a reproducing prototype, could you?

36:20.712 --> 36:22.111
That would be irresponsible.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.747
Which is unforgivable.

36:30.755 --> 36:34.191
(CLEARING THROAT)
Dr. Cormier will introduce to Cosima.

36:34.292 --> 36:35.350
<i>Enchanté.</i>

36:35.427 --> 36:37.190
It's time we begin fixing your mistakes.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.104
- Get all your stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:53.478 --> 36:54.536
Hey.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.746
The cops found your stolen car, Tony.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.213
Which means that Dyad"s not gonna be far behind.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.375
We do get it, Arthur, okay?

37:01.486 --> 37:02.680
Can you give us, like, two minutes, please?

37:02.754 --> 37:05.689
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be downstairs.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.690
But he needs to be on a bus.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.754
Now.

37:12.797 --> 37:13.855
Tell me something.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.966
Why is it that I'm not worried about you?

37:16.968 --> 37:18.230
'Cause this is how I roll.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.470
Can't fence this shit in.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.400
All right there, Tennessee Waterfall.

37:27.345 --> 37:28.539
Take this.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.478
There's three numbers in there, yeah?

37:30.882 --> 37:32.543
Me, Art and Sarah.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.685
You call it if anything goes wrong.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.616
You little...

37:40.925 --> 37:42.688
Later, sister kisser.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.704
Hey, come on, Scott, they're almost here.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.209
Ugh, give me a break!
What are you doing?

37:58.376 --> 38:00.037
- No!
- No?

38:03.148 --> 38:04.410
All right.

38:05.483 --> 38:08.145
- Wow. The original geneticist.
- Yeah.

An honour to be working with you.

Okay.

- Hi, umm, my maker.
- Oh, please, don't call me that.

38:59.537 --> 39:00.765
It's Ethan.

uh, Ethan.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.106
No, I suppose not.

We're ready to work.

39:08.546 --> 39:12.880
- We're very optimistic.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

39:14.452 --> 39:16.181
Uh, this is Scott.

39:17.288 --> 39:21.622

He's new to the whole thing, but...

Cosima!

40:54.085 --> 40:55.347
What's up with your garage?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.550
- Oil change.
- Renovating.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.957
- For the embryos.
- Those are my babies?

41:00.091 --> 41:01.922
Feel free to spend as much time here as you wish.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.355
You're a part of our family now.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.760
I'd like you to take over as interim director.
