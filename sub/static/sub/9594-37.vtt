00:26.394 --> 00:29.430
Titans, do you know
what day it is?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.735
ALL: Wednesday!

00:34.768 --> 00:35.869
Hump day, baby.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.706
Oh, yeah. Nothing better
than the middle of the week!

00:38.739 --> 00:43.211
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hump-hump.

00:43.244 --> 00:47.215
Wednesday.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.217
Uh, first of all, it's Friday.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.685
ALL: Friday!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.656
Enough. Yes, it's Friday.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.427
But more importantly,
it's payday.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.396
Why can it not
be the Wednesday?

01:02.430 --> 01:05.399
Woo-hoo-hoo. Loo-poo-poo.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.168
Hump-hump.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.504
So, what are you going
to spend this money on?

01:10.538 --> 01:13.874
I could really use
a new robot badonkadonk.

01:13.907 --> 01:18.179
Ooh, I also wish to purchase
the new robot badonkadonk.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.815
Books, books, books
and some books and books.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.451
Books.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.186
Wrong.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.420
Wrong.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.222
Wrong, wrong, wrong
and some wrong.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.191
Wrong!

01:30.224 --> 01:33.327
Money is not to be wasted
on things that bring you
happiness and joy!

01:33.361 --> 01:36.197
Money is to be hoarded,
until your have enough money

01:36.230 --> 01:38.666
that your money
makes more money.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.734
And then you spend that money!

01:40.768 --> 01:43.671
No! You hoard that money, too.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.907
Ew. This is why they say
money is the root of all evil.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.877
Money

01:49.910 --> 01:52.813
I know someone who
might change your mind
about that.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.649
Oh, well hi there.
I am money.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.752
Hi, money.
Nice to meet you.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.356
Now, did someone here
think I am evil?

02:02.390 --> 02:03.924
It is him. The green one.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.228
You are evil, bro.
I know your heart!

02:07.261 --> 02:09.397
Money doesn't have a heart,
Beast Boy.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.565
Exactly! He's evil!

02:11.599 --> 02:13.567
Watch your mouth
or I'll break your bones!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.569
What I mean is,

02:15.603 --> 02:19.907
how can I be evil
when I'm just a little
old piece of paper.

02:19.940 --> 02:24.478
You're not paper,
you're money! Silly, money.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.781
I am paper,
but I am also money.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.982
All I am

02:29.016 --> 02:30.918
is an agreed upon
representative of credit.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.254
Something you trade
for goods and services!

02:33.287 --> 02:35.289
-So I can be anything.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.658
Even paper.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.227
Can money be a pineapple?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.695
If everyone agrees on it,
sure.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.963
Can money be rocks?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.498
Absolutely!

02:44.532 --> 02:46.400
Can money be the blurp blops?

02:46.434 --> 02:47.668
Now you're talking!

02:47.701 --> 02:50.204
Can money
be Robin's stupid face?

02:50.238 --> 02:53.707
You show some respect!
Call me Sir or Dr. Money.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.511
Now, kneel before me
or I will destroy you all!

02:57.545 --> 02:59.847
My apologies, Dr. Money.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.882
Money's kind of
creeping me out.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.518
Yeah, he's making me
wanna be poor.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.886
See? Evil.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.389
And you know
what I do to evil.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.224
No! Stop it!

03:10.258 --> 03:11.925
No!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.967
Oh, you're gonna
make it, buddy.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.801
Hang in there.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.872
No, no.
It's too late for me, pal.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.719
Goodbye, cruel world.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.591
That's it!

03:43.624 --> 03:45.726
None of you are getting paid

03:45.759 --> 03:48.862
until you learn
to respect money!

03:48.896 --> 03:51.699
Fine with me, bro.
We don't need your money!

03:51.732 --> 03:54.835
But I wanna buy things so bad.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.904
I also wish
to trade the currency

03:56.937 --> 03:58.706
for goods and, or services.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.509
Yeah, people need money,
Beast Boy.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.876
Animals don't use money!

04:02.910 --> 04:05.713
And have you seen
an unhappy dog?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.348
-Of course.
-All the time.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.349
Look at that one.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.419
My friends, we have no choice

04:11.452 --> 04:14.555
but to respect money,
like Robin has asked of us.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.590
I'll never
respect money, Star.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.392
Not as long as it's evil.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.294
But I have an idea!

04:24.865 --> 04:27.701
Ah! Looks like
someone bought
some pizza!

04:27.735 --> 04:29.437
Well, in the spirit
of commerce,

04:32.406 --> 04:34.375
Sure, dude,
that'll be five bees!

04:34.408 --> 04:35.743
What?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.511
Five bees
for the slice of pizza.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.913
Bees
How about I give you a dollar?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.550
We only take
real money here.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.518
-Bees, brah.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.787
Bees aren't money, "brah".

04:46.820 --> 04:48.389
You said it yourself, Robin.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.792
Money represents credit,
so money could be anything.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.027
I choose bees.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.664
But bees are not
an agreed upon currency!

04:56.697 --> 04:58.699
No one is gonna pay you
in bees!

04:58.732 --> 05:02.470
Ooh, may I have
a triangle of the pizza?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.705
Sure thing. Five bees, please.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.444
Ow!

05:12.580 --> 05:15.115
Look, I don't have any bees.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.016
How about flies?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.951
Will you take three flies
for a slice?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.854
Three flies
won't buy you anything.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.764
I'd like a slice,
but all I've got
is a queen bee.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.636
Here's your pizza,
and here's your change.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.405
Two bumblebees.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.673
Hey, didn't I give you
a queen?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.875
My bad. I owe you a wasp.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.446
Mmm. Ouch. Mmm. Ow! Ow!

05:45.479 --> 05:46.547
Mmm.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.815
This is ridiculous.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.617
I am not using bees
as currency.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.786
Sounds like someone needs
to learn to respect money.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.823
The bee money. Ow!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.825
I only respect paper money.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.693
We'll see where that gets you.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.894
Ouch!

06:32.526 --> 06:33.861
BOTH: Ooh!

06:54.948 --> 06:56.183
Fifty thousand bees?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.118
I don't get out of bed
for less than 100!

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
Call me back when you're ready
to talk real bees.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.968
Robin, come in. Ow!

07:15.002 --> 07:18.071
-Ah, thank you for seeing me.
-Of course.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.073
I actually
owe this all to you.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.976
You told me to respect money,
and now I'm the richest man
in the world!

07:23.010 --> 07:25.779
Now, what can I do for you?
Ouch!

07:25.813 --> 07:27.515
I, uh...

07:27.548 --> 07:29.883
I just need some bees,
so I can get back
on my feet.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.051
Uh-uh-uh.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.252
I hate to see you suffer,
Robin.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.053
Ow!

07:33.086 --> 07:35.188
But I can't
just give you bees,

07:35.222 --> 07:36.890
you'll never learn to
respect your money
that way.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.659
Ouch! Ahhh!

07:38.692 --> 07:41.695
Are you okay?
You're getting stung a lot.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.130
I don't even
notice it anymore.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.765
Ow!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.634
Now, I won't
just give you bees,

07:46.667 --> 07:49.503
but I will give you
the opportunity to earn them.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.337
That's all I want!

07:50.370 --> 07:52.706
Good. You can
get started right away.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.807
Dance for me, peasant!

07:55.543 --> 07:58.245
You heard me.
Dance for your bees!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.582
What happened to you,
Beast Boy?

08:01.615 --> 08:04.585
You're not really
going to humiliate me
like this, are you?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.820
Wait, wait, wait.
This isn't the way.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.522
Thank you.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.591
Guys, check this out!

08:10.624 --> 08:12.225
You're gonna make him
dance for bees?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.595
-Ooh-hoo!
-This is gonna be good.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.829
Now dance!

08:19.299 --> 08:23.103
* Dance fo yo bees,
dance, dance fo yo bees

08:23.136 --> 08:26.907
* Dance fo yo bees,
dance, dance fo yo bees

08:26.940 --> 08:30.310
* Dance fo yo bees,
dance, dance fo yo bees

08:30.343 --> 08:34.147
* Dance fo yo bees,
dance, dance fo yo bees

08:34.181 --> 08:38.185
* All I want to do
is dance for some bees *

08:39.086 --> 08:40.921
Fabulous! You've earned these.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.156
Is this it? Ouch!

08:43.791 --> 08:45.626
Be grateful!

08:45.659 --> 08:46.894
Ouch!

08:46.927 --> 08:50.631
You were right, Beast Boy. Ow!
Money is the root of all evil.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.099
Even bee money! Ouch!

08:52.132 --> 08:54.635
It hurts to see
what it's turned you into.

08:54.668 --> 08:59.139
I'm sorry. I can't hear you
over all my bees!

09:00.874 --> 09:02.943
No! No! Ah! Ow!

09:13.153 --> 09:14.855
What's happening to him?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.925
This is what happens
when you let money
consume you.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.661
It turns you into a monster!

09:20.694 --> 09:23.931
Actually, I think
it's an allergic reaction
from the bee stings.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.670
No, he's swollen with evil!

09:29.703 --> 09:32.706
Or, maybe he's asking us
to call a doctor.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.207
We must destroy the evil

09:34.241 --> 09:36.810
that's consumed
our dear friend.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.378
Titans, go!

09:42.683 --> 09:45.218
It's working.
The evil is leaving him.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.220
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.694
It's good
to have you back, buddy.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.228
I'm sorry, guys.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.097
I don't know how
I got so caught up
in making money.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.367
Well, we all learned
something important
today, Titans.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.771
Whoever said,
"Money is the root
of all evil"

10:03.804 --> 10:05.372
was way off base!

10:05.405 --> 10:09.309
That's right. The real danger
is bee allergies.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.711
BEES: Hey!

10:10.744 --> 10:12.880
Sorry, for uh...
Beating you mercilessly.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.381
We thought you were a monster!

10:14.414 --> 10:15.448
It's cool.

10:15.482 --> 10:19.286
Friends, I have just received
the hospital bill.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.355
Ooh! That's gonna sting.
