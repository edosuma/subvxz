My boy's becoming a man.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.642
You know, seems
like just yesterday,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.579
the only thing you knew how
to do was fill up your diapers.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.348
Now look at you--
shaving your little peach fuzz.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.117
(laughs)

01:58.119 --> 02:00.385
Hey, slow down there.
What you trying to do?

02:00.387 --> 02:02.187
You're gonna scrape
half your face off.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.189
No... (sputters)

02:04.191 --> 02:06.625
The secret of getting
a close shave--

02:06.627 --> 02:08.861
long, slow strokes,

02:08.863 --> 02:11.363
always with the grain.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.332
Look, Dad, I got it, okay?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.200
I watched a video on YouTube.

02:15.202 --> 02:19.271
Oh. Yeah, I bet you did.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.739
You know,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.909
I've noticed you've taken
this, uh, sudden interest

02:23.911 --> 02:26.411
in personal hygiene.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.347
Now why is that?

02:28.349 --> 02:31.884
Can it perhaps be, oh, a young
lady that you got your eye on?

02:31.886 --> 02:35.554
Maybe someone you're going
to, uh, dance with tonight

02:35.556 --> 02:36.655
at the formal?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.723
No, Dad.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.724
You sure?

02:38.726 --> 02:40.309
Yes, sir.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.893
'Cause if you need to learn
some moves, I can teach you.

02:41.896 --> 02:45.697
All right, check it out.
This is how I got your mother.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.801
Yeah. Mm.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.437
No woman could resist that.
Wise ass.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.374
Know what they used
to call me when I was your age?

02:55.376 --> 02:56.708
(laughs)

02:56.710 --> 02:58.377
Sugar Foot.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.512
Dad, enough. You're embarrassing
us both, okay?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.815
If I happen to dance with
someone, I'll be just fine. Oh.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.517
So there is someone.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.252
I... It's...

03:07.254 --> 03:08.720
Look, it's-it's just dancing.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.422
Okay? It's just dancing.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.924
Just dancing, huh?
Yes.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.493
Yeah, well, let me explain
something to you about dancing.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.362
Dancing can lead
to other things.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.898
You know, I think
this is a good time as any

03:19.900 --> 03:21.633
to have this conversation. No.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.535
Is your...? Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Whoa.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.670
Wh-What was that, uh...
(stammers)

03:24.672 --> 03:25.938
the dance move--
the-the Cabbage Patch?

03:25.940 --> 03:27.606
Cabbage Patch.
Cabbage Patch. I love that.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.491
Yeah, Cabbage Patch.
Yeah, nice try.

03:29.492 --> 03:31.375
Smooth. Sit down, get comfortable.
We having this conversation.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.412
Come on now.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.480
Come on, sit down.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.850
All right,
first things first.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.589
Are you familiar
with the phrase "no glove,

03:43.591 --> 03:45.424
no love"?

03:47.528 --> 03:48.794
(sighs)

03:48.796 --> 03:50.896
Hey, hey! Hey.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.664
It's very, uh, formal for...

03:52.666 --> 03:54.566
It's poker night.
Yeah, well,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.368
I'm not staying, so...

03:56.370 --> 03:57.636
You scared of my game?

03:57.638 --> 03:58.837
I totally understand.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.706
I promise
I will take it easy on you.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.508
Okay, that'd be funny if you'd
ever beaten me one single hand

04:03.510 --> 04:05.944
in your whole life, but you
haven't. No. Rachel called.

04:05.946 --> 04:06.945
She had to move her flight up.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.547
I got to be a chaperone

04:08.549 --> 04:10.249
at Grace's winter formal.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.718
Here are the sandwiches
that I promised.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.254
You brought sandwiches,
but you're not staying?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.855
Yeah, I'm from
New Jersey. We take

04:16.857 --> 04:18.757
our sandwich commitments
very seriously. I know.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.459
Thank you for the sandwiches.
Mahalo.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.327
And, uh, I'm sorry
you can't stick around.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.763
Good news is maybe I'll get to
meet Grace's boyfriend now.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.331
Grace has a boyfriend?

04:26.333 --> 04:27.432
It's my theory.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.401
And you're going to spy on her.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.802
I'm not gonna spy on her.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.337
I'm-I'm gonna be
an involved parent, okay?

04:32.339 --> 04:33.672
Grace has a boyfriend,
I feel like

04:33.674 --> 04:35.340
I have the right
to know about it.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.376
Yeah, well, obviously,
she's a little skittish

04:37.378 --> 04:39.678
about you meeting him,
so just don't overreact.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.680
And, in fact, buddy,
this is a great opportunity

04:41.682 --> 04:43.348
for you to win, uh, uh,
brownie points.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.017
Cool dad points. I don't
want to be a cool dad.

04:45.019 --> 04:48.887
Cool dad has a teenager that
ends up pregnant or in jail.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.790
Or both. I got to
go pick up Grace.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.725
I'm late. Have fun.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.728
Yeah, you, too.
Hey, thanks for the sandwiches.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.397
Don't take credit for those.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.498
I would never do that.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.508
And this is the room
where Auntie and Uncle sleep.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.877
That's really nice.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.914
Now, is that a picture of you
on their dresser there?

05:15.916 --> 05:19.584
No, it's them with a friend.
See?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.587
I do see.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.389
(chuckles)
You know what,

05:24.391 --> 05:25.390
thank you very much, Miss Sara.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.326
You were
an excellent tour guide.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.795
But I think it might
be bedtime, all right?

05:29.797 --> 05:30.729
Should we say good night?

05:30.731 --> 05:31.730
Okay.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.365
Adios, Uncle Chin.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.934
Adios, boo. Sweet dreams.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.870
(clears throat)

05:39.907 --> 05:41.006
What?
Did you just turn

05:41.008 --> 05:42.808
your six-year-old niece
into a spy?

05:42.810 --> 05:43.775
No.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.677
Maybe.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.413
Yes. What of it?

05:48.415 --> 05:49.815
You need to let this go.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.019
Look, I get it.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.620
You love that little girl.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.955
You want to protect her.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.423
It's actually really sweet.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.424
But you
don't approve

05:59.426 --> 06:00.659
of my tactics.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.561
Look, I'm in
no position to judge.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.030
But I do feel sorry
for your future daughter.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.698
God help that child.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.899
(chuckles)

06:15.109 --> 06:18.610
You look very pretty in your
dress tonight, very grown-up.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.878
Thanks.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.783
Did I do something
to upset you?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.752
Besides raise you?

06:26.754 --> 06:31.456
No, but I'm just worried
you're gonna spy on me tonight.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.975
I'm not gonna spy on you.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.493
I'm not gonna do anything
that interrupts you having

06:34.495 --> 06:35.594
a good time, okay?

06:35.596 --> 06:36.595
Promise?

06:36.597 --> 06:37.596
Yes, I promise.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.164
Okay?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.933
I am, however, uh,
looking forward

06:41.935 --> 06:43.902
to meeting any,
uh, special friend

06:43.904 --> 06:44.870
that you might want to... What?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.005
You see?

06:46.006 --> 06:47.139
You're already breaking
your promise.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.974
What are you ta...?
That's not spying--

06:48.976 --> 06:50.876
it's meeting.
I said I would like to meet,

06:50.878 --> 06:53.145
shake hands. "Hi, Mr. Williams.
Nice to meet you."

06:53.147 --> 06:54.663
Like a gentleman.
That's it.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.180
Just simple like that.
If you give me that,

06:56.183 --> 06:58.617
then I will sit in the corner
and you will not know I exist

06:58.619 --> 06:59.885

Mr. Williams, hi.
What's up, buddy?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.280
Uh, I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Yeah, I didn't know either.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.649
I got to, uh... I got to
ask you a favor. Yes, sir.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.751
Grace, I promised her that
I would not spy on her tonight.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.219
Um, so I don't want
to spy on her,

09:14.221 --> 09:15.787
but I want to ask you some
questions, do a little research.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.188
Look, Mr. Williams,
I-I already know

09:17.190 --> 09:18.890
where this is going, okay?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.326
You want me to tell you about
her boyfriend. Yes, I do.

09:21.328 --> 09:25.030
Mr. Williams, I... Listen, before you say
anything, I know the kind of kid you are.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.332
You don't want to rat on Grace,
I respect that. Thank you.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.235
Yeah, you're a good kid, okay?
But think about it like this.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.870
You would be
doing her a favor

09:31.872 --> 09:33.638
by telling me what
I want to know.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.339
I would?

09:34.341 --> 09:35.340
Yeah, you would.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.308
How?

09:36.310 --> 09:37.842
How? Because if you

09:37.844 --> 09:40.045
don't tell me right now,
I'm gonna go over there,

09:40.047 --> 09:41.746
I'm gonna ask her. I'm
gonna interrogate her in front

09:41.748 --> 09:43.315
of all her friends. You want
me to do that? No, sir.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.917
No.
No.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.986
You're really gonna make me
tell you this, aren't you?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.921
"Make" is-is a strong word.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.757
And you're very perceptive.
So, yeah, come on.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.260

10:01.868 --> 10:04.302
I'm Grace's boyfriend.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.805
No. No, seriously, come on.
Yeah.

It's Danny.

the two of them are dating, huh?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.369
I was just talking
to Will today,

11:11.371 --> 11:12.771

squirrely,

11:12.773 --> 11:14.139

11:14.141 --> 11:15.874
Uh-oh? What, uh...
what's uh-oh?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.942
Of all the things
I was hoping you'd say,

11:17.944 --> 11:19.678
"uh-oh" was very low
on the list.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.746

I kind of had the talk

11:21.748 --> 11:23.081

That's-that's at the bottom,
buddy, okay? The talk?

I don't know what you're worried
about, man. Relax.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.021
It wasn't much of a talk anyway.
These kids watching YouTube, and

11:30.023 --> 11:31.690
the Internet is a damn
free-for-all.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.733
Grace has a boyfriend, or-or

11:41.735 --> 11:44.069
because Grace's boyfriend
happens to be my son?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.370
I don't know. Both.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.739

so, unfortunately, now,

13:16.563 --> 13:19.831
I have to watch you... uh...

Okay... And keep in mind--
wait, wait, wait, keep in mind

13:49.563 --> 13:52.030
when you answer that I was
your age once, like I said,

13:52.032 --> 13:54.432
so I know that your inclination
is to tell me exactly

13:54.434 --> 13:56.234
what you think I want to hear.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.035
I also want you to keep
in mind that I'm a cop.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.371

flag down a... a passing car
or something

to the control room.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.233
Okay, control room is there.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.768
Okay, uh, that's not too far.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.737
I can't have you walking
those halls with me,

16:45.739 --> 16:48.139
you're gonna stay here. No,
no, no, I should go with you.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.218
Computers?
You know...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.754
Good-ish. Okay, because if my dad
had to walk into a control room,

17:02.756 --> 17:04.589
and had to change the
sign by himself...

17:04.591 --> 17:06.357

17:46.833 --> 17:50.601
All the cables from the servers,

(opening panel)

17:54.707 --> 17:57.208
(panting)

17:57.210 --> 17:58.726
It's a crawlspace.

17:58.727 --> 18:00.243
It might lead all the way
to the control room.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.846
Uh-huh.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.581
I guess that makes sense.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.183
Something wrong, Mr. Williams?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.451
No, nothing's wrong,
we're talking about it.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.585
Let's just it over with.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.287
Let's go.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.193
(girls crying)

18:19.199 --> 18:22.100
(whispering):
It's gonna be okay. Really.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.334
(crying):
How can you say that?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.735
My dad's here.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.707
(grunting)

18:32.712 --> 18:34.212
(breathing heavily)

18:34.214 --> 18:36.514
DANNY:
Yeah.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.382
Mr. Williams?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.383
You okay?

18:39.385 --> 18:41.319
I'm great, I'm great.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.387
A-Are having a panic attack?

18:43.389 --> 18:45.423
A little claustrophobic.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.226
Keep going, don't stop.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.660
Let's just have
a conversation, okay?

18:49.662 --> 18:50.862
Just keep talking to me,
all right?

18:50.864 --> 18:52.163
Okay.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.331
Okay, um...

18:53.333 --> 18:54.599
what do you want to talk about?

18:54.601 --> 18:55.884
I don't know about what,

18:55.885 --> 18:57.168
talk to me about Grace,
how about that?

18:57.170 --> 18:58.603
Tell me about Grace.
Why Grace?

18:58.605 --> 19:01.139
Sh... she's smart and funny...

19:01.141 --> 19:02.507
Funny? You can't do
better than that?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.375
She's my, she's my best friend.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.145
Um... we have stuff in common.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.679
Like, uh...

19:08.681 --> 19:10.515
our dads are both cops.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.783
We both like winter and...

19:12.785 --> 19:14.285
miss the snow.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.420
You know, she-she-she's
just really honest.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.723
I mean, if I say
something stupid,

19:18.725 --> 19:20.658
she'll just call me
out on it, you know?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.460
That's really great.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.463
Sounds just like her mother.

19:33.373 --> 19:37.408
Oh, okay, thank you very much.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.843
Let's see what you got, okay?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.545
(out of breath):
All right.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.947
(typing on keyboard)

19:42.949 --> 19:45.550
(digital beeps)

19:47.420 --> 19:48.586
That's it?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.921
I could've done that.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.956
Okay, um, what
should we change it to?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.559
Uh, do, uh, "Hostages inside.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.394
Call 911."

19:56.396 --> 19:57.662
Okay.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.963
Think it'll work?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.332
Yeah, it's gonna work.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.700
As long as someone sees it,
it's gonna work.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.877
Excuse me.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.612
Did you see that sign?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.650
Oh, there's a dance
going on inside.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.285
High school kids.
Probably a prank.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.655
Okay, but what if it's not?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.867
What are you doing in here?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.319
You're supposed to wait outside.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.770
And you were supposed to
grab the kid and leave,

20:39.772 --> 20:42.707
not take hostages. There's a problem.
Your boy is missing.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.609
That's not possible,
I brought him in here myself,

20:44.611 --> 20:45.610
he must be in the building.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.223
You sure about that?

20:47.224 --> 20:48.835
Because my guys have been
searching everywhere.

20:48.836 --> 20:50.447
The sign out front was changed.
What are you talking about?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.850
It was changed to read,
"Hostages, call 911."

20:52.852 --> 20:54.452
The boy must've done it.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.486
I'll cut the power.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.687
This kid is screwing
everything up.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.822
We better find him!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.929
WILL: Someone must've seen
the sign by now.

21:04.931 --> 21:05.997
I mean...

21:05.999 --> 21:07.898
the cops must be
on their way, right?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.433
Yeah, that's what
I'm hoping for.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.502
Listen, do not move,
stay here, okay?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.738
Okay.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.373
(door closes)

21:16.342 --> 21:18.576
(tires screech)

21:26.486 --> 21:28.019
That's not good.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.489
Someone's coming?

21:31.491 --> 21:32.957
Yeah, someone's coming,
but not who we wanted.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.692
More bad guys with guns.
Wait, what,

21:34.694 --> 21:35.726
(stammering):
like reinforcements?

21:35.728 --> 21:36.994
I don't know, listen to me,

21:36.996 --> 21:39.397
You, get in that crawlspace,
do not move

21:39.399 --> 21:40.998
until this whole thing is over,
you understand me?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.301
I should help... Hey, hey, hey,
don't argue with me, all right?

21:43.303 --> 21:45.002
You're already dating
my daughter, I don't need

21:45.004 --> 21:46.637
another reason not to like you.
Get in that crawlspace,

21:46.639 --> 21:49.073
do not move until
this is over, you hear me?

21:49.075 --> 21:50.074
Okay.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.375
All right.
Go on, go on.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.779
Mr. Williams.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.980
Good luck.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.315
Thank you.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.382
Close the door behind you.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.397
DOG:
<i> Okay, all you high makamakas,</i>

22:13.399 --> 22:15.766
you're in trouble now.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.468
I call.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.703
That's too rich for my blood.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.739
I bow. I can't handle it.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.740
DOG:
Ooh...

22:22.742 --> 22:24.675
Chin!

22:24.677 --> 22:25.676
I'm in.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.812
Really? Are you sure about that?

22:27.814 --> 22:30.414
I'm gonna be scared of you?
You call with any pair you got.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.749
And, you, I think
you're bluffing.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.517
I think you're
all bark and no bite.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.552
Roof!

22:34.554 --> 22:35.686
That's it. Let's see 'em.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.954
Boom!

22:36.956 --> 22:39.557
(exhales)
Ah, well, how about that?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.592
Ace, ace, baby!

22:41.594 --> 22:43.961
Oh, not again!

22:43.963 --> 22:45.663
You took the last
steak sandwich,

22:45.665 --> 22:47.498
and now you take
all our money?

22:47.500 --> 22:48.632
What can I say,
bruddah?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.768
The Dog is off his leash.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.436
All right, next hand.

22:52.438 --> 22:55.106
Hey, Lou, you in?

22:55.108 --> 22:56.974
Huh? No. Um, no. Sorry.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.843
You know what?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.711
Now, this is the fifth text
I sent to Will.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.713
Lou, he's at a dance, okay?
He's having fun.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.715
He doesn't want to text
with his dad.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.051
Or he's hiding in the bathroom
from Danny.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.486
(laughter)

23:08.488 --> 23:10.104
You know what? You're right.

23:10.105 --> 23:11.721
I was thinking the same thing.
I'm going down there.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.625
(others groaning) No, no,
I'm going down there.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.594
Don't touch my cigar.
Leave my cigar right here.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.995
And leave
my Scotch here, too.

23:17.997 --> 23:18.996
It's my son,

23:18.998 --> 23:20.865
and I know how Danny can get.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.833

25:05.705 --> 25:06.837
I changed my mind.
Come here, help me...

25:06.839 --> 25:08.005
Help me tie this guy up.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.840
One on each ankle,
and one up the middle.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.575
All right?
Okay.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.110
TALIB (over radio):
Jalil, Akeem? Is anyone there?

25:13.112 --> 25:16.714
Sorry, Jalil and Akeem can't
pick up the phone right now

25:16.716 --> 25:18.716
because they picked the wrong
two guys to mess with, right?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.718
You're definitely a Grover.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.087
RASHEED (over radio): It's
Rasheed. No sign of the boy.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.122
I don't know what happened
to the others.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.726
TALIB: There's no way that Pinoy
brat is picking us off.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.994
There must be someone else
in the building.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.062
Who's a Pinoy?
Is that Filipino?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.864
Yeah.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.833
Wait...
What? What?

25:35.835 --> 25:38.102
I think I know
who they're after.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.870
Jeremy Ramos.
He's a tenth-grader.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.138
What is he, a rich kid?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.740
Not just rich,
his dad's some type of,

25:42.742 --> 25:44.241
uh, important diplomat.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.577
I hate politics.
All right, look,

25:46.579 --> 25:48.078
we gotta find this kid
before they do.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.280
Hold this.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.549
I think I have an idea
of what he's doing.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.150
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.952
Stay close, okay?

25:57.823 --> 26:00.624
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you?

26:00.626 --> 26:02.793
No, I just gotta go in here
and talk to my son.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.562
Well, the doors are locked.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.096
What do you mean locked?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.898
There's kids in there.
That's a fire hazard.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.167
Guess it keeps 'em
from wandering off.

26:10.169 --> 26:15.205
All right, my man,
I'm a cop, okay?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.174
I need you to go over there and
open those doors for me right now.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.609
Brah, I don't
have the keys.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.578
In fact, I'm
locked out myself.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.214
How do you get locked out?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.318
All right, I'm gonna
call my son.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.820
Maybe he can find somebody
to get us both in.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.356
Aw...
(scoffs)

26:32.358 --> 26:34.825
Got no signal.
Dead spot.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.794
You might have more luck
trying over there.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.866
This is crazy.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.335
I'm switching companies.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.804
WILL:
Hey, Jeremy.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.138
Hey, kid, wake up.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.841
Young Will.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.677
You changed your mind.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.980
Dude, you narced on me!

26:55.982 --> 26:57.498
Hey, hey, hey.

26:57.499 --> 26:59.015
Listen to me. There's
people looking for you.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.218
Okay? We gotta get you out
of here right now.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.620
You understand?
We gotta go, okay?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.088
(door opens)

27:07.693 --> 27:10.094
I got nothing
over here, either.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.329
Here we go.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.198
Looks like I'm getting
a signal now.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.335
(grunts)

27:20.373 --> 27:21.739
Guys, behind you.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.245
(grunts)

27:28.247 --> 27:30.047
Stay down!

27:31.851 --> 27:34.118
What the hell is
going on in here?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.356
Oh.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.695
Let's go, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

27:44.697 --> 27:45.863
Come on, come on.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.799
McGarrett, party over.
(gunfire)

27:48.801 --> 27:49.867
You need to get your ass
down here right now! Right now!

28:12.858 --> 28:14.892
Any word on the hostages?
Nothing yet, but we think

28:14.894 --> 28:16.293
Danny, Grace, and Will
are inside.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.294
We tried to call
inside the building

28:17.296 --> 28:18.974
but the phones are disabled

28:18.975 --> 28:20.653
and the cell signal's
being jammed.

28:20.654 --> 28:22.332
So we don't even know
what they want.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.202
No, but I think that's
about to change.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.071
(Grover knocks on truck)
Hey!

28:27.073 --> 28:28.272
Step out, I want
to talk to him.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.014
I got nothing to say.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.084
Okay, Frank.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.086
What, are you surprised
I know your name?

28:42.088 --> 28:43.220
Who do you think
you're talking to?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.988
I'm the police.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.257
Yeah, I ran your
fingerprints.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.093
I know you work security for
the Philippine consulate.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.829
I talked to your
co-workers.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.097
You're a degenerate
gambler.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.431
I assume that's why
you did this.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.999
But I don't care
about that.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.501
Let me tell you what
I do care about.

28:57.503 --> 29:01.004
I care about
who hired you...

29:01.006 --> 29:02.306
and why.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.408
Maybe you never
done this before.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.509
See, this is the part
where you tell me

29:06.512 --> 29:08.946
what I want to know.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.348
And you're gonna
do it, too.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.484
Remember when I
walked up to you?

29:13.486 --> 29:15.486
I told you my son
was in there.

29:15.488 --> 29:18.889
So you better tell me
what I want to know.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.492
Or what?
You gonna hurt me?

29:21.494 --> 29:23.427
You're not gonna
hurt me.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.995
You're a cop.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.869
You're right.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.139
By the way, that shoulder
won't hurt as bad

29:35.141 --> 29:37.541
once they take
the bullet out.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.944
Well, maybe I can
help you with that.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.980
(screaming)
Huh?

29:42.982 --> 29:45.415
I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm not a doctor.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.384
(groaning)

29:47.386 --> 29:49.186
Okay, yes.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.188
(pained groan)

29:56.095 --> 29:57.861
You were saying?

29:59.932 --> 30:03.867
This is a layout
of the first floor.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.436
Multiple access points.
That's good.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.004
If we breach, they won't know
where we're coming in.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.172
On the other hand,
we don't know where

30:08.174 --> 30:09.173
they're holding the hostages,

30:09.175 --> 30:10.791
so we'd be
going in blind.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.408
All right, now we know
what we're dealing with.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.246
This guy was paid off by a
terror group called Jemaah.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.848
Jemaah?
They're al-Qaeda.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.817
They're a splinter group
of al-Qaeda.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.351
They're based
out of Jakarta.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.420
The target is one
of Will's classmates--

30:23.422 --> 30:26.356
this kid named
Jeremy Ramos.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.293
And his father is some
high-ranking diplomat

30:29.295 --> 30:30.411
in the Philippines
government.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.528
And this son of a bitch
is supposed to be

30:31.530 --> 30:32.896
the kid's bodyguard.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.565
Well, what would the Jemaah
want with them?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.266
I asked him about it,
he didn't know.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.267
He might just be saying that.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.303
Trust me, Kono,
if he knew,

30:39.305 --> 30:40.654
he'd have told me.

30:40.655 --> 30:42.004
All right, we need to get
Jerry on the line.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.008
Maybe he can tell us more
about this splinter group.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.012
We went through the list
of people who checked in.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.280
They're all accounted for
except for one--

30:50.282 --> 30:53.317
Will Grover.
He's a ninth-grader.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.852
There's also a parent
who never checked in--

30:54.854 --> 30:57.154
Rachel Edwards.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.122
So you think a ninth-grader
and some soccer mom

30:59.124 --> 31:00.457
are the reason
we're down six men?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.226
No, Talib.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.866
Okay, I think I know
what this is about.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.133
The Jemaah's number one,

31:10.135 --> 31:12.269
an imam named Suharto Chandra,

31:12.271 --> 31:14.271
has been in jail in the
Philippines for three years.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.073
So they're looking
to make a trade.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.508
Trade their leader for this
diplomat's son? Right.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.943
Yeah, but if they guy's been
locked up

31:19.945 --> 31:21.545
for three years already,
then why now?

31:21.547 --> 31:24.047
Maybe because Suharto Chandra's
scheduled for execution

31:24.049 --> 31:25.666
in two days.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.284
So the clock's ticking.
These guys have to do something.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.352
They're desperate.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.287
A trade? I mean,

31:30.288 --> 31:32.221
most governments, they don't
negotiate with terrorists.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.324
Yeah, Lou's right,
but this one might.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.460
Because the reality is
this is our best bet

31:36.462 --> 31:38.028
at ending this standoff
peacefully.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.030
Jerry, thank you.
Stay by the phone, all right?

31:41.166 --> 31:43.500
Chin, how's HPD doing tracking
down Jeremy's father?

31:43.502 --> 31:44.968
I was told he was
en route right now.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.970
Okay, good, do me a favor,
stay on him, please.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.139
Get with this-- if we open
a dialogue with these guys,

31:49.141 --> 31:50.407
I need him on site
right now.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.142
I'll keep you posted.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.347
Uh...

31:57.349 --> 31:59.149
I have to go
to the bathroom.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.150
Too bad.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.019
(crying)

32:02.021 --> 32:03.954
Quiet. Stop that.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.490
MAN: I said shut up!

32:06.492 --> 32:07.557
Take her.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.170
TALIB: "Danny Williams."

32:20.172 --> 32:22.039
Is that name on the list?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.541
No.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.044
♪ ♪

32:27.046 --> 32:29.579
Where is he?
I don't know.

32:29.581 --> 32:30.714
You think something
happened to him?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.182
Look, relax, okay?

32:32.184 --> 32:34.151
He's checking things out.
The guy's Five-O.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.285
I'm sure he's fine.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.386
Maybe they got him.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.121
(door opens)

32:39.458 --> 32:41.091
Guys all right?

32:41.093 --> 32:42.292
What's going on?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.194
SWAT's outside,
your father, Five-O.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.462
They got the place surrounded.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.097
So, as much as I've enjoyed
our time together,

32:47.099 --> 32:48.699
it looks like it's coming
to an end, all right?

32:48.701 --> 32:51.068
Jeremy, you all right?
Yes, sir.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.403
(radio crackles) TALIB:
Danny Williams...

32:53.405 --> 32:56.173
We know you have Jeremy Ramos.
Bring him to us in two minutes

32:56.175 --> 32:59.209
or I begin shooting
his classmates.

33:00.212 --> 33:03.280
And I'll start
with your daughter.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.455
Time's almost up, Mr. Williams.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.425
DANNY:
Hey. Hey.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.994
We're right here, all right?

33:18.030 --> 33:21.298
Just relax.
Everything's cool, okay?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.467
Turn off the jammer.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.769
(woman whimpers)
(beeps)

33:27.306 --> 33:29.373
(phone ringing) Hey, hey, hey.
This might be them.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.174
Jeremy's father's here.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.176
Excellent.
(phone continues ringing)

33:33.178 --> 33:34.344
(beeps)

33:34.346 --> 33:35.779
This is Commander McGarrett.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.214
Who am I speaking to, please?

33:37.216 --> 33:39.116
TALIB:
My name is not important.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.518
The only thing that matters
is what I need from you.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.353
Danny probably gave him
his number.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.421
Which means he's okay.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.207
Here's what's
going to happen.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.791
You're going to talk
to Jeremy Ramos' father

33:48.794 --> 33:51.495
and have him arrange for
the release of Suharto Chandra.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.330
STEVE: Yeah, we're working
on that right now,

33:53.332 --> 33:54.598
but I need something from you.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.068
I need an assurance
that those hostages are okay.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.237
He wants to know if you're okay.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.806
All right, uh, Steve.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.408
We're fine, everybody's fine.

34:04.410 --> 34:05.542
Nobody's hurt, okay?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.344
Fine for now.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.514
You have one hour
to arrange for the release.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.315
Then we start shooting people.

34:13.519 --> 34:14.518
RAMOS:
<i> Is there any word</i>

34:14.520 --> 34:15.936
on my son?

34:15.937 --> 34:17.353
We have received assurances
that everybody inside

34:17.356 --> 34:19.723
is okay for now.
And their demands?

34:19.725 --> 34:22.459
As we suspected, they want
to swap the life of your son

34:22.461 --> 34:25.595
for their leader's freedom.
I'm afraid that's not possible.

34:26.799 --> 34:29.666
Well, damn it, you better offer
them something.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.369
You don't want to negotiate
with terrorists, your son

34:32.371 --> 34:34.571
is in there. My son is in there!
I'm very sorry to hear that.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.406
But there's no way I can give
them what they want.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.543
Then why don't you get someone
on the phone who can?

34:39.545 --> 34:41.178
You don't understand.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.780
I already spoke to my president.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.249
He won't let the country
be blackmailed.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.818
It don't have to come
to that and you know it.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.419
These kind of situations,
there's all kinds

34:49.421 --> 34:50.554
of back-channel negotiations.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.823
Your president can say
he didn't know.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.691
He wanted to prove a point.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.360
So, he expedited
the imam's execution.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.398
What are you saying to me?

35:01.400 --> 35:02.466
The imam can't be freed
because he's already dead.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.848
The only thing we got
going for us right now

35:17.850 --> 35:19.850
is that the Philippine
government has not made news

35:19.852 --> 35:21.518
of this execution public yet.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.185
GROVER: Yeah. Well, Ramos
can get his government

35:23.188 --> 35:24.688
to hold off on that announcement.
KONO: Yeah,

35:24.690 --> 35:26.690
but it's a matter
of time before that news leaks.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.425
Well, then, we're gonna
have to breach before then.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.693
No, no. We can't breach yet.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.573
We don't know how many
of them there are,

35:31.574 --> 35:33.452
we don't know what kind of
firepower they have, or where

35:33.453 --> 35:35.331
they're even holding the hostages. We
can't get close enough for thermals.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.801
What if we can convince them
to release a few hostages?

35:37.803 --> 35:39.469
STEVE:
Yes, yes. That means

35:39.471 --> 35:41.171
we get a couple of kids back,
(phone ringing)

35:41.173 --> 35:44.307
and those kids can tell us
what the setup is in there.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.277
(beeps)
Commander McGarrett.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.578
Have you made the arrangements?

35:48.580 --> 35:49.746
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.448
I need a show
of good faith from you.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.883
I need a couple hostages.

35:52.885 --> 35:55.385
Not going to happen.
STEVE: Two hostages.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.154
You're wasting time,
time which you do not have.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.388
Because in 30 minutes,

35:58.390 --> 35:59.556
people will die.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.891
Just listen to me, two kids.

36:00.893 --> 36:03.226
What's it gonna hurt,
just give me two kids.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.495
Ask again and I'll shoot
two hostages.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.696
(mouths)

36:06.698 --> 36:08.165
DANNY:
Hey, hey.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.766
Let me...
let me talk to him, huh?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.368
And why would I do that?

36:11.370 --> 36:12.569
'Cause we want the same things.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.938
Okay? He frees your guy,
we all get to go home.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.673
I can help, all right?
That's all we want,

36:16.675 --> 36:18.775
we just want to go home.

36:21.446 --> 36:22.679
(grunts)

36:25.784 --> 36:27.317
If you say the wrong thing...

36:27.319 --> 36:28.652
Just relax, okay?

36:28.654 --> 36:30.320
Just relax.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.788
All right?

36:33.825 --> 36:34.858
Steve?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.926
Danny.

36:35.928 --> 36:37.661
Listen to me, these guys,

36:37.663 --> 36:38.929
they mean business, okay?

36:38.931 --> 36:41.198
(sighs)
So, you-you got to...

36:41.200 --> 36:42.666
you got to do what they say.

36:42.668 --> 36:46.670
All right, call the consul,
do what you will.<i> Call</i>

36:46.672 --> 36:49.806
who you will. Okay? All right,
because-cause they're,

36:49.808 --> 36:51.408
they're gonna do what they say
they're gonna do,

36:51.410 --> 36:52.676
they will, you understand?

36:52.678 --> 36:55.812
Call who you will, all right?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.682
He's the first one to die.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.283
You have 29 minutes.

37:00.285 --> 37:02.552
"Call whoever you will"?

37:02.554 --> 37:04.421
That doesn't sound like Danny.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.656
Will... Will.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.426
Will is someplace safe in there,
Danny is telling me to call

37:09.428 --> 37:11.928
my son.
Call him right now.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.630
(phone beeps) Hello. Dad?
(whispers): Dad.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.432
GROVER: Will, what's up
with you, boy, you all right?

37:15.434 --> 37:17.667
Yeah. I'm fine.
Thanks to Mr. Williams.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.403
We changed the sign and we took
out some of the guys that...

37:20.405 --> 37:22.939
He... he hid me in this tunnel to be
safe... All right, all right. Son.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.508
Just slow down, slow down. Okay?

37:25.510 --> 37:26.943
What's going on?

37:26.945 --> 37:29.312
Dad. I'm-I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Grace.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.314
I know I should've,
I... I'm sorry.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.316
We'll talk about that later.
Everything's gonna be fine,

37:33.318 --> 37:34.851
