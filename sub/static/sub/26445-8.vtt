09:30.278 --> 09:31.862
Isn't that right, old timer?

09:31.946 --> 09:34.532
I'm not an old timer.
A lot of kids got arthritis.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.450
[Lola] Hey, Andrew!

09:36.534 --> 09:39.704
Just like 9-11, I'll never forget,

09:39.787 --> 09:41.998
Osama bin Rubbin'.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.418
Boy, that was a walk
to get to Osama bin Rubbin', but it works.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.337
-God, I'm afraid of her.
-Oh, you should be afraid!

09:48.421 --> 09:49.422
[evil laughter]

09:49.505 --> 09:52.758
I'm just gonna set up right here.
[chuckles]

09:52.842 --> 09:56.262
Don't worry. I'm not gonna,
like, gay you in your sleep or anything.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.930
Why wold you even say that?

09:58.014 --> 10:01.851
It is physically impossible to turn
another human being into a homosexual.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.978
Uh... I'm just joking.

10:04.061 --> 10:09.525
Oh, Mattie, you've gone and made it weird.
[evil laughter]

10:09.609 --> 10:11.861
Hey, nice Carmen San Diego sleeping bag.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.822
-Actually, it's a knock-off.
-Oh, Miranda San Francisco.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.907
My mom bought it at the 99 cent store

10:16.991 --> 10:19.076
-that also sells milk.
-Whoo!

10:19.160 --> 10:20.578
-I know, it's super fancy.
-Yeah.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.039
I can't believe
we get to sleep next to her!

10:23.122 --> 10:26.542
What if it happens again?
What if it's under the bra this time?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.961
-Dude, you need to calm down.
-But how can I?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.254
I know. How can I?

10:30.338 --> 10:34.258
[Gina] It turns out, Miranda San Fransisco
actually lives in Sacramento.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.261
That's why no one can find her,
'cause nobody wants to go there.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.305
That's one of the best jokes
of the school year.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.223
Sacramento can eat its own ass.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.894
-[groans] Gina can't be that funny, right?
-She sucks!

10:44.977 --> 10:46.520
That's how funny you get with no boobs.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.024
She's making me feel crazy,
like a dirty cat.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.942
[meows]

10:52.026 --> 10:55.071
[scoffs] Her hair is, like,
not even that shiny.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.324
I know, it's, like, just regular.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.034
I don't even get why Nick likes her.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.286
[scoffs] Probably 'cause she let him
touch her boob.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.163
Um... What?

11:04.246 --> 11:05.498
Oh, nothing.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.583
I can't believe Gina let him do that.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.252
Well, wait.
Haven't you let DeVon does your boobs?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.838
Yeah, but after like 20 make-outs.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.590
-There are rules.
-Who makes the rules?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.051
-The prettiest girls in each grade.
-Oh, right.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.512
And now guys are just
going to expect it right away

11:19.595 --> 11:22.056
and all because of that slut, Gina.

11:22.139 --> 11:22.973
[Shame Wizard]
Ah!

11:23.057 --> 11:26.477
The 'S' word.
I thought you were a feminist,

11:26.560 --> 11:29.230
and now you're an accessory
to slut shaming.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.899
I didn't mean to say anything.
It was an accident.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.192
Was it, though?

11:33.275 --> 11:36.153
Hey, Devin, you're not gonna tell
anyone what I said, right?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.824
Oh my God. Nick felt up Gina?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.992
Oh. Was I not supposed to tell?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.120
No, it's important that people know.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.748
It's not like she, like, rubbed fronts
like a good girl.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.835
What... a... slut.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.350
WHAT A SLUT

12:06.434 --> 12:08.811
Whoa! Bro, you touched Gina's boobs?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.688
I never even got close to her girdle.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.732
-Respect.
-What? Girdle? How did you...

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
[cell phone beeping]

12:13.899 --> 12:15.025
Oh, shit.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.653
No, this is what we want.
You're the winner!

12:17.737 --> 12:21.240
You're Lil Mr. Boobie Boy!
Here, try that on.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.159
Oh! You look incredible.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.202
-No, I'm not wearing this.
-You don't like it?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.455
Hey, Nick, what did they feel like?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.290
Guys, I don't know if I should say.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.875
Although if he did say,

12:30.958 --> 12:33.711
he'd seem like a real Big Dick Boy,
wouldn't he?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.546
Go tell them. Nick, tell them!

12:35.629 --> 12:37.339
You know you want to.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.383
Since you guys seem pretty cool,

12:39.467 --> 12:42.052
I will say they felt like

12:42.136 --> 12:46.557
-the world's most perfect water balloons.
-Whoa!

12:46.640 --> 12:48.809
But here's what I wasn't expecting, boys.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.020
They were warm to the touch.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.147
Thank you for the boner.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.523
So, Nick, did you spread 'em?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.233
Maybe. What do you mean?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.152
Did you go like this and spread them?

12:58.235 --> 13:01.363
You're supposed to try to get them
as far away from each other as possible.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.158
Sorry. I'm pretty sure
you don't spread 'em.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.285
-How would you know?
-Yeah, Matthew.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.495
Uh, never mind.

13:07.578 --> 13:13.542
There's nothing sadder than the lonely
gay kid trying to be one of the boys.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.586
[evil laughter]

13:15.669 --> 13:17.963
What an evening to be alive!

13:18.422 --> 13:19.965
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.426
I have to show you something,
but you can't be upset.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.344
Okay.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.512
HI, I'M A SLUT

13:24.595 --> 13:25.554
What the...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.848
-[boy 1] Gina Alvarez...
-[girl 1] She let him what?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.850
-Nick touched her boob.
-We are gossiping.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.768
SLUT

13:30.851 --> 13:34.230
[Shame Wizard] Everybody  knows.
You never should have done it.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.107
You're a slut.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.235
[boy 2] She's a slut.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.570
[softly] I want to talk like this, too.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.448
Hey, where's my sleeping bag?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.908
Sleep under the bleachers,

13:45.991 --> 13:48.160
You Mike and Ike-eating bitch!

13:48.244 --> 13:49.912
My bag! Wait, Mike and Ikes?

13:49.995 --> 13:51.997
I've never once even those.
I can't even picture them.

13:52.081 --> 13:56.001
You wish,
you movie theater candy-eating nobody!

13:56.085 --> 13:58.504
Are they one--
Is it a bar or is it little bits?

13:58.587 --> 14:01.340
Um, what's that duct tape trash bag
next to your stuff?

14:01.423 --> 14:05.511
Oh, that's my sleeping bag.
It doubles as a car window, so...

14:05.594 --> 14:08.013
Coach Steve and Jay are now best friends.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.932
I fuck my pillow. Let's talk about that.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.434
Hmm, we all already know
how you fuck pillows.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.603
This is a new
and somehow sadder thing.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.647
We are not friends! [screams]

14:16.730 --> 14:18.691
That's right, we are best friends.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.360
-No, we're not!
-Jay, are you mad at me?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.361
Just go away.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.447
Is it because I made thick
in your mom's warm?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.366
-Steve!
-Whoa mama!

14:27.449 --> 14:29.034
-Jay's mama.
-Wait a second.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.830
Your mom is the woman that Coach Steve
lost his virginity to?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.999
It was her warm?

14:35.082 --> 14:38.294
[laughs] I bet that man baby
has a big old horse cock.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.880
The dumb ones pound the hardest.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.592
Jay, let's not forget
that you were so lonely,

14:44.675 --> 14:49.013
you offered your mother's body
in exchange for friendship

14:49.096 --> 14:51.181
with this beef-cocked drooler.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.517
Oh, my God, I hate you!
You're such an idiot!

14:53.601 --> 14:56.812
Well, if you hate me then I hate me too,
'cause we're best friends.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.063
I love you, my dude.

15:00.024 --> 15:00.858
[imitating fart]

15:00.941 --> 15:03.903
Shit! I can't not do the shake.
It's such a good handshake.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.072
All right, everyone.
If you can look up at the sky,

15:07.156 --> 15:09.158
there are many constellations
visible tonight.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.744
And also, as a teacher who wants to speak,

15:11.827 --> 15:14.872
I will say the stars are just like us.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.624
I heard that from the gas pump TV,

15:16.707 --> 15:19.835
but don't drink the gas, kids,
'cause it's expensive.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.629
Okay, and also other reasons.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.006
Yeah, 'cause it tastes like a car.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.593
Matthew, we have to gossip
about this Gina sitch.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.763
-Pass.
-Relax, queen. It's just girl talk.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.972
Well, I'm not a girl.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.058
Right, but you're not like a boy.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.184
Jeez.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.063
-You don't fit in anywhere, do you?
-Well, that's fine.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.272
I don't wanna fit in.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.733
You know how I can tell when you're lying?

15:42.816 --> 15:45.444
-You look fat.
-Oh boy, you're good.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.528
[yawning]

15:47.488 --> 15:50.407
Dude, how are you falling asleep?
It's only, like, 9:45.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.992
Yeah, that's late for me.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.328
Once Lester Holt is done with the news,

15:54.411 --> 15:55.663
I'm done with my day.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.914
You watch network news?

15:56.997 --> 16:00.209
When the internet gets it right
for 50 years, I'll turn to them.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.087
Well, why don't you just go in
and take a quick nap?

16:03.170 --> 16:06.006
-The eclipse isn't for another hour.
-Oh, that's a fine idea.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.925
I don't think
Coach Steve will notice anyway.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.636
-Now, if you all take out your telescopes,
-Steve...

16:10.719 --> 16:13.555
You'll notice
there's a little bit of sand in here.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.599
[softly] That's a wiffle ball bat,
not a telescope.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.892
Whoa, stop the clock.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.270
If this is a wiffle ball bat,
then what are my sneakers?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.606
They're French bread pizzas?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.359
Is that why my toes are so gooey?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.237
Missy! I'm so glad you're back.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.571
Slide in next to me.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.074
Yeah, but I'm just here
for a quick power nap.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.158
[sighs]

16:33.909 --> 16:35.411
-What's wrong?
-Now I can't sleep.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.579
A worm dance always helps you sleep.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.541
I think we're only supposed to do that
in my bedroom.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.084
Oh, yeah. Totally.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.087
Is it cool if I just kind of back it up?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.297
-Oh, well...
-It's just so chilly in here

16:47.381 --> 16:48.424
and you're so warm.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.926
Well, you're pretty warm, too.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.138
-You feel really, really warm.
-[moaning]

16:54.221 --> 16:55.347
Yeah.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.350
The group of stars right above us
is called the Sculptor.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.520
Many believe the Sculptor represents
Pygmalion from Greek mythology.

17:01.603 --> 17:05.149
That's the history of Greek yogurt
starring John Stamos.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.109
No, it isn't. As the story goes,

17:07.192 --> 17:09.695
Pygmalion sculpted a statue
made of ivory...

17:09.778 --> 17:11.655
-[Steve] And ebony.
-...and fell in love with it.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.366
-What?
-[woman] He named it Galatea.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.953
Everyone is talking about you, Gina.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.456
[indistinct whispering]

17:20.581 --> 17:21.665
She's such a slut.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.709
What did you just say?

17:23.792 --> 17:27.963
I said you're a  slut.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
[grunts, groans]

17:30.132 --> 17:31.175
Fight!

17:33.177 --> 17:35.596
-Andrew! You're missing a cat fight.
-Girls, stop it!

17:35.679 --> 17:38.974
-Don't worry. I'll take care of this.
-No, Steve!

17:39.058 --> 17:41.685
Oh no! I meant to hit the kids!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.854
Look what you've done!

17:43.937 --> 17:45.981
Turned girl against girl.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.942
Oh, no! We're a part of the patriarchy.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.402
Hey, girls! Come on!

17:50.486 --> 17:52.071
Get off me, slut!

17:52.154 --> 17:54.156
[panting]

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076
[crying]

17:57.743 --> 17:59.536
[grunts] What happened?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.413
I think Lola might have
given you a concussion.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.998
How many penises am I holding up?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.250
Well, two, but one of them is very--

18:05.334 --> 18:08.378
Shh! He doesn't know he's different.
I tell him he's special.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.463
Hmm.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.716
[Nick] You know who we've all completely
overlooked as a romantic partner?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.593
-Missy Foreman-Greenwald.
-Huh?

18:14.676 --> 18:16.178
[Andrew] I didn't overlook her.

18:16.261 --> 18:20.057
She was mine for a time, but alas,
our passion, it ran too hot.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.935
Who could blame you?
Everything about her is amazing.

18:23.018 --> 18:27.272
Her face, her leadership skills,
her emotional intelligence.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.983
I like how we're both
in jazz club together.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.569
Woo-hoo! And she got a body.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.071
[moaning[

18:34.154 --> 18:35.572
[Lola] Oh my God!

18:35.656 --> 18:38.242
-Missy's, like, jerking off.
-[gasps]

18:38.325 --> 18:41.078
She's such a horny spazz, you guys.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.830

18:51.547 --> 18:54.925
did you find
this girl's humiliation erotic?

18:55.008 --> 18:59.721
No, I just liked seeing her masturbate

Oi-va-voy, when you say it out loud...

19:01.890 --> 19:05.561
