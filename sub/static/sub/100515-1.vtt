punchier all the time.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.424
Very punchy, in fact.

quite so smashy?

Well, that's
what the people like.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.530

but bellow.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.613
It's you who does nothing
but bellow,

11:21.615 --> 11:24.916
and as a grown man,
it's harder to fathom.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.751
And before I knew it,

11:26.753 --> 11:31.022
I was falling...
ooh, right down,

about to meet my end.

to meet me,

11:41.301 --> 11:43.535
it wasn't the hard clay,

11:43.537 --> 11:47.238
but a giant pillow
of autumn leaves

we can stroll.

serving you anything but?

you'll likely turn into one.

Punch.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.813
We were hoping perhaps

13:34.815 --> 13:38.716
you'll do us the honour
of casting the first stone?

13:38.718 --> 13:40.285
Oh, why, thank you.

I hear you've netted
some good ones.

Oh, yes, we've been
saving them up for today.

had a feeling about that one.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.361

for even an hour.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.434

31:55.948 --> 31:56.713
Please, Punch.

31:56.715 --> 32:00.751
Punch, try to remember
what you've done with her.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.102
She's lost her shoe, Punch.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.071

32:21.073 --> 32:22.606

That baby just couldn't
keep itself put.

I'd sit her down in one place
and turn for a moment

in another.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:35.971

catches up.

01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:39.507

gonna happen,

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.910
you go traipsing
back into town

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:42.577
ranting and raving?

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:46.882
They already think you're dead,
and now suddenly you're not.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.149
That's gonna make you a witch

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:51.653

in their eyes for sure.

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.421

what actually happened.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.792

01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:09.704

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.306

If I don't go back, he wins.

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:18.380
I have to run away.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.982
I have to leave my home.

important stuff just then.

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:47.909
You can't hunch her over
like you would the maid.

01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:49.477
This one's built proud
and upright.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.279
You have to keep
a straight spine with her

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.749
or you won't get the right
movements through her arms.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.953
Relax the arms

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:01.222
and get her straight
through the spine!

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:04.592
She'll tangle again
if you pull up so quickly.

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:08.163

it won't do a thing right!

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:16.571
You can't be dropping
the puppets.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:17.906
They're mighty delicate.

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:21.977
If you break this one's face,
I'll be tempted to break yours!

You're of simple mind.

You're a simple-minded dimwit!

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.885
You've got to listen
when I tell you things.

Unless you get this show right,

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.489
you'll be stuck in Seaside

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:38.860

stinking Welshmen for eternity.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:42.831
I might not be as smart as you,
Punch,

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:44.532
but it don't take a big brain

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:48.670
to know it was Judy who held
this show together anyways.

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:55.076

just missed the announcement.

Announcement?

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.647
You'll be relieved to hear
that a full confession

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.916
has been elicited
from both prisoners

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.217
and an announcement made

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.253
that they shall hang
before the month is out.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:41.756
I would have thought
I should be asked to attend,

No need to worry, Constable.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:01.576

to have them off the streets.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:05.480
