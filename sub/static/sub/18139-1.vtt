Hey, what're we doing here?

01:05.465 --> 01:08.742
They're giving that car away?
That thing's sweet.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.679
Janie's birthday party
starts in 10 minutes.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.648
I know, but this'll just
take a couple of seconds.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.152
- Larry.
- Oh, come on, it'll be awesome.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.748
(SPUTTERING)

01:18.312 --> 01:19.378
Hey, I'll meet you up
at the raffle table.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.220
Larry.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.888
It's hard to believe,

01:24.952 --> 01:26.829
but you're even more
beautiful when you're angry.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.889
- Hello, Brooke. (CHUCKLES)

01:28.956 --> 01:32.733
Hello, Beauregard.
Nice to find you here.

01:32.793 --> 01:36.138
My family's auto dealership
is sponsoring this raffle.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.540
You know, we're giving
away a pretty nice car.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.335
Hank, come on.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.380
- Hurry up, Ernie.
- ERNIE: Go in.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.916
Would you mind putting these in, dear?
Thanks.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.576
Good luck, lady.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.388
I cannot believe you're
still with Larry Guthrie.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.721
Yep, but if he doesn't drive me
to my niece's birthday party

01:53.780 --> 01:55.247
in the next (LOUDLY)
two minutes,

01:55.649 --> 01:58.289
- all bets are off.
- Really?

01:58.585 --> 02:00.121
- Hey, do you mind if.. Oh.
- Back off.

02:00.253 --> 02:03.564
Why don't you give me a call
if you need a car or...

02:04.491 --> 02:06.266
Or anything else.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.828
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.607
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

02:15.369 --> 02:16.746
<i>Who wants to win a car?</i>

02:19.706 --> 02:22.346
Dude, the dream car of all cars.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.513
<i>Let's find out</i>

02:23.577 --> 02:26.080
<i>- who that lucky bowler is going to be.
- Us!</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:30.789
Please.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.351
<i>Our lucky bowler is...</i>

02:39.192 --> 02:40.796
<i>Larry Guthrie!</i>

02:40.894 --> 02:43.841
- All right, Larry! <i>Yeah!</i>
- You gotta be kidding me!

(ERNIE WHOOPING)

Peanut butter! Peanut butter!

02:51.304 --> 02:52.942
(WHOOPING)

02:54.408 --> 02:56.979
Honey, how cool is this?
It's like winning an Oscar.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.422
You promised me you would
go to Janie's party.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.388
But she's one year old.
She ain't gonna know I'm there.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.951
It's not about the party, it's
about you keeping your promises.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.191
If there's one thing that little kid'll like,
it'd be knowing I won that muscle car.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.320
You just don't get it, do you?

03:08.955 --> 03:12.402
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's
hear it for Larry Guthrie.</i>

03:15.128 --> 03:17.836
Honey. Honey, come on.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.811
Hey, baby, it is a Camaro.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.439
<i>Let's bowl.</i>

03:23.670 --> 03:27.550
<i>All Larry has to do is make
the famed 7-10 split.</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:29.687
<i>Can he do it?</i>

03:31.712 --> 03:32.782
Let's see what you got.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.723
(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

03:41.354 --> 03:43.800
You still have two chances left.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.603
Larry, that was so, so close.

03:55.669 --> 04:00.015
But, hey, no pressure at all.
You still have one chance left.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.343
HANK: He's way too tight.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.513
We've got to calm him down.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.089
Time out.
I need some nachos, pronto!

04:08.849 --> 04:11.352
- Chow down, buddy.
- HANK: Munch them down. Go, boy!

04:11.818 --> 04:13.627
- You feel good? (MUFFLED) Yeah

04:13.687 --> 04:15.667
Larry, hey, hey, hey, we don't
have all day, all right?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.800
That's what I needed. Nachos.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.029
It's like a B12 shot.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.265
- HANK: Go for it, Larry! Go!
- Let's do this!

04:21.327 --> 04:23.808
I got it! Yeah, yeah, I got it!
Now I'm good. Now I'm ready.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.810
All right, Brooke.
This one's for you.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.782

(YELLING)

05:25.725 --> 05:28.535
Hey, why don't you stop
fiddling with your own car,

05:28.628 --> 05:31.040
come over here and try and
work on somebody else's?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.311
(HORN BLARES)

05:34.734 --> 05:36.611
All right, I'm coming.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.871
(SIGHS)

05:40.841 --> 05:44.516
For Pete's sake, you guys.
All right, now try it.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.320
(ENGINE STARTING)

05:49.649 --> 05:51.686
(CHUCKLING) Who's the man?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.291
Hey, let me see
that sports page.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.329
He's gonna find out
sooner or later.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.391
Find out what?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.770
Hank, I tell you what, you
are a bad poker player.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.009
I thought it... (SIGHS)

06:12.272 --> 06:13.649
You guys broke up
over a year ago.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.778
What, you thought she was
never gonna move on?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.389
Thought she was just
playing hard to get.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.382
I thought she was
just being smart.

06:22.582 --> 06:23.720
That's enough.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.386
Larry, why don't you
channel that anger

06:25.452 --> 06:27.720
into repairing a car instead
of doing something stupid?

06:29.589 --> 06:31.466
Stupid ain't in my vocabulary.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.188
Perfect. (SIGHS)

06:58.952 --> 07:00.522
You're marrying
Beauregard Billings?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.966
- Beauregard Billings, seriously?
- Just wait one second, okay?

07:04.024 --> 07:07.267
- You're marrying Beauregard?
- Ms. Miller, I found my sketch pad!

07:07.327 --> 07:09.603
- Good.
- Not now, kid. I'm not signing autographs.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.237
Still humble as ever.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.709
She wants an autograph.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.645
Sydney, do you have any
idea who this man is?

07:17.671 --> 07:18.671
The janitor?

07:20.540 --> 07:24.010
The janitor. I'm Larry Guthrie,
the bowling champion

07:25.478 --> 07:26.957
Metro County Miracle.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.050
Doesn't really ring a bell.

07:29.416 --> 07:33.193
(SIGHS) Boy, what're they teaching kids nowadays?
Obviously not about me.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.588
Sydney, why don't you draw me a
really pretty picture, okay?

07:36.890 --> 07:39.530
I need to have a word
with the janitor.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.162
Beauregard Billings.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.571
- He goes by Bo now.
- “Goes by Bo now.“.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.474
He's running for mayor, so
he changes his name to Bo?

07:46.533 --> 07:49.776
He hasn't worked an honest day in his life.
Unbelievable.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.377
People change, Larry.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.749
Just because you never grew up
doesn't mean other people can't.

07:55.241 --> 07:59.053
Why do I wanna grow up?
I'm the Metro Lanes' Miracle Man.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.216
I'm awesome.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.513
You slipped on nacho
cheese and got lucky.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.992
All right, I'm 50% awesome.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.190
But I'm still 1,000 times more
awesome than Beauregard Billings.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.728
I don't want awesome,
I want an adult.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.431
Somebody who is ready for the
responsibility of a family.

08:14.761 --> 08:18.470
And I waited along time for
you to become that person,

08:18.732 --> 08:19.767
and you didn't.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.143
- Well, I was gonna...
(CAR HONKING)

08:22.202 --> 08:23.647
Oh, boy.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.846
Who wants a Bo Billings Frisbee?
Here you go.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.476
Remember, vote for Bo Billings.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.448
- Who wants a stress ball?
- KIDS: I do!

08:33.513 --> 08:35.652
- Stress ball! There they are!
- Me! Me! Me!

08:35.715 --> 08:38.991
Now remember to tell your parents
to vote for Bo Billings, all right?

08:40.720 --> 08:44.395
Well, if it isn't Larry Guthrie.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.166
Hey, save your stress ball on me there, Billings.
I'm voting for the other guy.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.298
(BO LAUGHS)

08:49.362 --> 08:50.432
Hey, beautiful.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.038
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.572
I gotta go, Larry.
It was nice seeing you.

08:55.635 --> 08:56.739
- LARRY: Yeah.
- Bye.

08:56.803 --> 08:57.941
All right, I'll see you later.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.644
(BO LAUGHS)

09:01.408 --> 09:03.581
All the people in Ocala
she could go out with,

09:03.643 --> 09:05.054
and she goes out
with that goofball.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.725
He's a fraud, is what he is.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.988
MATTHEW: There he is.
Come on, you guys. Shh!

09:10.717 --> 09:11.683

09:13.987 --> 09:15.159
Whoa!

09:15.221 --> 09:16.325
ASHTON: Real funny, guys.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.663
Hey, hold on. Hold on a sec.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.832
- You wanna make a quick five bucks?
- BOYS: Sure.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.669
Okay, honey, be
completely honest.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.267
Which one do you like better,
this one or this one?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.375
Wow, they're both so similar.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.070
Well, I mean, I am photogenic, sweetie.
I understand.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.612
- Yeah.
- But, really, try to pick the best one.

09:36.643 --> 09:37.781
- Come on.
- GABE: Hey, mister.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.219
Look, I made this for
the tooth fairy.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.658
Yeah, that's pretty good, kid.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.065
- Perfect, I'll use them both.
- Fire!

09:48.121 --> 09:49.623
Done. Oh!

09:49.689 --> 09:51.600
(LAUGHING)

09:51.758 --> 09:53.169
Hey, what're you guys doing?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.330
(LAUGHING)

09:56.729 --> 09:58.402
What's that about
the tooth fairy?

09:58.465 --> 10:00.775
Oh, I have a loose tooth. See?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.334
Oh, that's awesome. That's good.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.544
No, no, the shirt's fine, sweetie.
Look at the face.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.242
So, I made this for her.

10:06.706 --> 10:07.946
That's good, kid. That's cool.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.453
Wow, and you know what?
You're gonna have to take this one, too, so...

10:10.510 --> 10:12.888
- But, you know what, sweetie...
- I wanna be an artist when I grow up.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.392
Well, you ought to stay a
kid as long as you can.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.291
You don't wanna grow up any
sooner than you have to.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.227
- Why?
- Well...

10:19.285 --> 10:20.855
So sorry.
Let me just dry you off real fast.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.526
- Growing up stinks.
- Why?

10:23.723 --> 10:26.223
'Cause things don't always turn
out the way you'd planned it.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.696
Why?

10:28.428 --> 10:31.773
True love is a fairy tale,
just like the tooth...

10:32.932 --> 10:33.933
Uh...

10:35.268 --> 10:37.009
(DISTORTED) No, no.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.713
No, there is a tooth... Listen.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.309
Hey, did you hear that story
about the tooth fairy?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.979
Once upon a time, there was
this little tooth fairy...

10:44.043 --> 10:45.681
- No, kid! Where're you going?
- I'm telling on you!

10:45.745 --> 10:47.725
Hey, kid, hey.
Get back. Kid! Kid!

10:47.780 --> 10:50.226
- Ms. Miller, Ms. Miller!
- LARRY: Def-Con 4! Def-Con 4!

10:50.884 --> 10:52.830
Hold on, kid. Let me borrow you.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.820
What are you doing, dude?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.099
A little game called
“saving my butt.“.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.262
- Honey, what's wrong?
(GABE SOBBING)

10:59.325 --> 11:02.431
That man told me something
bad about the tooth fairy.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.829
BROOKE: All right.
Wait, come here. What is this?

11:04.731 --> 11:05.937
What...

11:07.133 --> 11:10.307
Oh, honey, no, come here.
Come here.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.810
LARRY ON <i>TV: Dreams come true!</i>

11:46.739 --> 11:47.740
<i>BROOKE: Mmm-mmm.</i>

11:48.341 --> 11:50.651
You know what happens if
you eat too much chicken.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.690
You turn into a chicken.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.683
I'm pretty sure that
ain't gonna happen.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.522
Mmm-mmm. It's a scientific fact.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.455
Haven't you ever heard the
expression, “You are what you eat“?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.765
You're just trying to get
that last chicken wing.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.692
How dare you.

12:03.756 --> 12:07.260
All right, well, there's
only one way to settle this.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.706
- Yeah, a barbecue sauce mustache contest.
(LARRY LAUGHS)

12:10.763 --> 12:12.106
One, two, three, go!

12:16.336 --> 12:17.872
Nothing beats a Tom Selleck.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.344
Dadgummit.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.918
- Unless you're Rollie Fingers. Well played.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.319
Thank you. It is a close call.

12:28.848 --> 12:32.386
Maybe we should put our
mustaches together

12:32.452 --> 12:34.363
and see what happens?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.725
Gotta tell you, I
kind of like that.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.008
You know what, Brooke?

12:45.064 --> 12:47.442
I'm about to stop you from
making the biggest mistake

12:47.500 --> 12:50.003

14:00.640 --> 14:03.211
Do you know why you're here?

14:04.577 --> 14:08.047
Well, because I ate too much chicken
and you turned me into a chicken.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.992
Great, another genius.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.499
Well, then it's a
chicken-induced hallucination.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.007
Believe me, I've OD'd
on enough chicken

about there, little girl.

me back to the way I was before.

You know, I'm gonna
go get you a tooth,

37:49.567 --> 37:52.446
but there's a little thing on TV right
now called a fishing tournament,

37:52.504 --> 37:54.040
which I was enjoying immensely.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.441
Larry, for once in your life,

37:56.508 --> 38:00.684
can you stop being a 10-percenter
and try to be a 110-percenter?

38:01.046 --> 38:03.993
What're you talking about?
I've already got the case card right here.

38:04.048 --> 38:05.254
I know what I'm doing tonight.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.524
Hey, you know what? You think I can
have some more amnesia powder?

38:07.585 --> 38:08.689
I'm almost out of it.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.754
Fine.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.326
What is that?

38:12.390 --> 38:15.064
These are “glow of the
firefly“ berries.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.702
They make you light
up like a firefly.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.264
Hence the name.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.400
Can I have some of those,

38:20.465 --> 38:22.775
'cause where I'm going tonight,
it gets really dark at night.

38:23.234 --> 38:25.578
(SARCASTICALLY) Yes, it
does get dark at night.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.209
Your powers of perception
never cease to amaze me.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.755
But very well, you may
have three firefly berries

38:34.179 --> 38:36.591
and a refill of amnesia powder.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.855
- All right.
- Anything else that you want from me?

38:38.917 --> 38:41.090
Well, yeah, there is.
I been meaning to talk to you about it.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.099
I need to get a new outfit.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.495
Don't push your luck.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.130
It's not comfortable, though.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.936
The more comfortable I am,
the more teeth I get.

38:51.396 --> 38:55.037
I see. How about this?

38:57.001 --> 38:58.412
What am I, Captain Cavity?

38:58.470 --> 38:59.744
They'll laugh me right
out of the house.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.442
Or this?

39:04.743 --> 39:05.778
Seriously?

39:07.278 --> 39:08.279
Is this better?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.917
(LAUGHING) Yeah, this is good.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.387
I'm gonna come over that
table in about five seconds.

39:13.451 --> 39:14.657
I think it's you.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.995
Can't you just give me
something normal to wear?

39:17.355 --> 39:21.735
If I give you overalls, will you stop
bothering me and go get me some teeth?

39:22.093 --> 39:23.401
Tell you what, you
get me overalls,

39:23.461 --> 39:25.168
I'll bring you a whole
wheelbarrow full of teeth.

39:26.631 --> 39:27.632
But they're pink.

39:28.266 --> 39:29.870
- Bye.
- Wait a sec...

39:32.804 --> 39:35.512
Boy, you sure do love
pink, don't you?

39:36.141 --> 39:37.814

ain't permanent.

Funny, real funny.

How's that tooth treating you?

41:26.417 --> 41:27.987
Oh, wow.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.828
Now remember, when it falls out, you
need to put that under your pillow.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.458
Why, what's the point?

41:32.524 --> 41:34.936
Oh, come on, I thought
you'd be over that by now.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.634
Hey, look. You got a pretty
good talent for art, son,

41:38.696 --> 41:40.676
so I went up and I
got you these books.

41:40.732 --> 41:43.975
There's all kinds of pictures and it
tells you all about the artists in them.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.948
If you read them, I guarantee you,
you'll be just as good as they are.

41:47.538 --> 41:48.573
These are for me?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.144
Yeah, they're for you.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.712
Just make sure you take them back to the
library when you're done with them.

- Thanks.
- Let me see that tooth again.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.056

better financial shape.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.899
I know it's in here somewhere.
What in the world did I do with it?

49:28.332 --> 49:29.333
Oh.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.679
There it is.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.374
Larry, can I ask you a question?

49:34.438 --> 49:35.712
Sure, darling. What is it?

49:36.607 --> 49:38.780
Will you make my sister go away?

49:39.443 --> 49:41.480
Will I make your sister...

49:42.013 --> 49:43.924
What're you talking about?

49:43.981 --> 49:45.358
My baby sister.

49:45.850 --> 49:48.694
Mom and Dad spend all
their attention on her.

49:48.752 --> 49:51.164
They don't care
about me any more.

49:51.656 --> 49:54.034
Will you use magic
to make her go away?

49:54.091 --> 49:56.697
Hey, I don't wanna hear
you talk like that.

49:56.761 --> 49:58.934
Your mom and dad still
care about you.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.409
It's just that your little sister's little.
You just wait and see.

50:02.466 --> 50:05.242
You and her, you're
gonna be best friends.

50:05.636 --> 50:09.243
It's gonna be fun.
But right now, she can't even talk.

50:09.306 --> 50:10.410
You know what that means?

50:10.474 --> 50:13.512
You can blame a lot of stuff on her.
Trust me.

50:14.778 --> 50:16.121
I'm the tooth fairy.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.456
Okay, thanks, Larry.

50:19.417 --> 50:22.660
You got it, sport.
Oh, hey, remember,

50:24.488 --> 50:26.729
you never saw the tooth fairy.

50:29.693 --> 50:30.694
(SIGHS)

50:33.631 --> 50:35.736
We're all set.
Fire it up, Ernie.

50:37.668 --> 50:39.545
- Hey!
- HANK: That's it.

50:39.603 --> 50:41.776
Check it out. That's awesome.

50:41.839 --> 50:45.184
Hey, Brooke, check it out.
Look at the hand, moves and everything.

50:45.242 --> 50:46.414
We done all that today.

50:46.477 --> 50:48.286
It looks amazing.

50:48.345 --> 50:50.347
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah.

50:51.081 --> 50:52.560
What's wrong?

50:52.683 --> 50:54.492
(SIGHS) Bills, Larry.

50:55.252 --> 50:59.200
I can barely keep this place afloat and
the kids need so many new materials.

50:59.423 --> 51:01.664
I don't know how
I'm gonna do it.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.797
Well, all you gotta do is slap
that thing on eBay I just made,

51:04.862 --> 51:06.500
and make about $50,000.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.702
I wish.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.609
Ms. Miller! Ms. Miller!
Look what I made.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.037
Gabe, that's amazing.

51:13.103 --> 51:14.707
LARRY: You drew that?

51:14.939 --> 51:16.816
Get out of here. Look at that.

51:18.809 --> 51:21.415
Boy, that ought to be
in a dadgum art museum.

51:21.479 --> 51:23.481
You're a regular artiste.

51:23.948 --> 51:24.983
Wait a second.

51:26.817 --> 51:29.058
Think I just figured out a
way to help this place out.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.235
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

51:38.796 --> 51:39.934
I like that one.

51:39.997 --> 51:42.568
Me, too.
I think I'm gonna buy it.

51:42.633 --> 51:44.579
Hey, that's nice.

51:45.402 --> 51:47.040
Got any money?

51:48.005 --> 51:49.040
That's awesome.

51:51.775 --> 51:52.776
LARRY: Gabe.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.791
How you doing, buddy?
Good to see you.

51:55.846 --> 51:56.984
You must be Gabe's dad.

51:57.047 --> 51:58.617
- Frank McGee.
- Frank, I'm Larry.

51:58.682 --> 52:00.127
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

52:00.184 --> 52:01.561
Did you put my painting up?

52:01.619 --> 52:02.996
Did I put your painting up?

52:03.053 --> 52:04.760
Check out what I done.

52:04.822 --> 52:06.495
Look at this.

52:06.557 --> 52:08.264
Dude, you're the hit
of the whole thing.

52:08.325 --> 52:10.498
Look at all these,
they all sold.

52:10.561 --> 52:12.837
Every one of them gone
in less than 10 minutes.

52:12.896 --> 52:13.966
Really?

52:14.031 --> 52:16.602
Yeah, they sold.
And guess which one I bought.

52:19.170 --> 52:20.240
That one.

52:20.304 --> 52:22.784
That's right, and I'm gonna give
it to her when I see her, too.

52:23.340 --> 52:26.810
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go find some of your buddies?

52:26.877 --> 52:28.720
Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

52:28.779 --> 52:30.850
- He's something else.
- Yes.

52:31.816 --> 52:34.160
I really appreciate what
you're doing for my son.

52:34.218 --> 52:35.458
Oh, he's a great kid.

52:35.619 --> 52:36.654
How do you do it?

52:37.688 --> 52:40.567
I mean, how do you talk
to him about things

52:40.624 --> 52:43.798
like painting and art?

52:45.262 --> 52:47.139
How do you get him
to talk to you?

52:47.198 --> 52:48.905
Shoot, I don't know
nothing about art.

52:49.533 --> 52:52.673
I just kind of encourage him a
little bit, show him that I care.

52:52.736 --> 52:55.478
You know what it means when you're
worried about being a good father?

52:55.572 --> 52:56.573
No.

52:57.074 --> 52:58.576
It means you're a good father.

52:59.810 --> 53:01.084
(CHUCKLES)

53:01.946 --> 53:04.790
Thank you.
I better catch up with Gabe.

53:05.149 --> 53:06.526
You got it.

53:06.951 --> 53:09.363
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, you, too. Good to see you.

53:09.420 --> 53:11.957
- Larry, look at this.
- Hey, Brooke.

53:14.124 --> 53:16.468
- Get out of here.
- Unbelievable.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.905
Not only are we gonna be
able to pay our bills,

53:18.963 --> 53:22.001
but we're actually gonna be
able to buy all-new supplies.

53:22.066 --> 53:23.443
Oh, man, that is awesome.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.878
- I don't know...
- Who's the man? What'd I tell you?

53:24.935 --> 53:26.278
You're the man. Larry,

53:26.871 --> 53:29.249
I gotta admit, I had
my doubts about you.

53:29.306 --> 53:30.717
- But you really...
- Hey, honey.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.755
- Hey, hi.
- I'm sorry I'm late,

53:32.810 --> 53:35.654
but you know those big campaign
donors, they like to talk.

53:35.712 --> 53:39.353
Yeah, so, tell me, how many of these
paintings you need me to buy?

53:39.416 --> 53:40.486
None.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.963
- None?
- We sold every single one.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.261
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.533
(LAUGHS) That's super.
- I know.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.265
Yeah, let me hold that for you.

53:50.327 --> 53:52.364
- Thank you.
- So which one did you buy?

53:52.429 --> 53:53.499
Well...

53:55.632 --> 53:58.442
(LAUGHS) Wow, that is...

53:59.670 --> 54:01.775
ls awful.

54:01.839 --> 54:04.547
- No.
- I mean, even for a kid, that's bad.

54:05.008 --> 54:06.214
What's it supposed to be?

54:06.276 --> 54:07.584
What you mean what's
that supposed to be?

54:07.645 --> 54:08.885
What are you, blind?

54:08.946 --> 54:11.984
That's a tooth fairy
battling aloud piglet.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.729
I mean, it ain't
that bad, really.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.128
It's abstract.

54:16.720 --> 54:17.960
Yeah, what she said.

54:18.288 --> 54:19.858
Abstract.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.698
Yeah. Abstract, huh?

54:22.292 --> 54:23.600
"HEY. honey.
- Ready to go?"

54:23.661 --> 54:25.868
Yeah, let's go. I missed you.

54:26.563 --> 54:29.476
Beauregard, you got no
regard for good art.

54:31.735 --> 54:33.510
(HAMMER POUNDING)

54:36.206 --> 54:38.186
- BROOKE: Morning!
- Hey.

54:38.976 --> 54:40.956
Well, you're here
bright and early.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.315
We don't open for another hour.

54:43.514 --> 54:45.016
Well, I couldn't
sleep last night.

54:45.082 --> 54:48.359
I got to thinking about this little
building here and it needs work done.

54:48.419 --> 54:51.127
So, I come up to get it fixed.

54:51.188 --> 54:54.294
Look how sturdy I got it now.
Look at that.

54:54.358 --> 54:57.396
Yeah, this from the guy
who once faked a coma

54:57.461 --> 54:59.566
to get out of my
nephew's piano recital?

54:59.630 --> 55:03.305
Well, that was the old Larry.
This is the new, improved, mature Larry.

55:03.667 --> 55:06.238
If I didn't know better, I'd
think this new, mature Larry

55:06.303 --> 55:07.680
was trying to impress me.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.216
(CHUCKLES)

55:10.074 --> 55:11.985
How's the new,
mature Larry doing?

55:12.042 --> 55:13.453
(MESSAGE TONE BEEPS)

55:13.510 --> 55:17.253
Excuse me, new, mature Larry I
have a text from my fiancé.

55:18.949 --> 55:19.950
Boom.

55:21.118 --> 55:22.927
Everything all right?

55:24.054 --> 55:25.658
Yeah, it's fine.

55:26.890 --> 55:30.394
Bo's campaign meeting just got
rescheduled for this afternoon

55:30.461 --> 55:33.499
and we were supposed to go taste
wedding cakes then and that's...

55:33.564 --> 55:36.443
Hold it. Did you just say cake?

55:45.742 --> 55:48.348
BAKER: Well, it's not a
traditional wedding cake, but...

55:48.412 --> 55:51.018
Look at this. Chocolate.

55:52.549 --> 55:53.857
Orange butter cream frosting.

55:53.917 --> 55:56.591
Kind of balances out. I like it.

55:56.653 --> 55:59.065
A bowling legend
and a cake expert.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.727
- He's quite a catch. (LAUGHS)

56:01.325 --> 56:03.931
- No, we're not actually engaged. He's just...
- LARRY: No, she's right.

56:03.994 --> 56:05.974
I am a tremendous catch.

56:08.499 --> 56:09.910
Brooke, you gotta try this.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.446
Oh, my gosh, it's incredible.

56:11.502 --> 56:14.312
You always did like
orange butter cream.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.351
I can't believe you remembered that.
I like that.

56:16.407 --> 56:18.182
I remember anything
that's food-related.

56:18.542 --> 56:19.680
True.

56:20.277 --> 56:21.654
Sorry, I'm late.

56:22.680 --> 56:23.954
- What are you doing here?
- BROOKE: Hey.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.925
Larry is helping me
taste wedding cakes

56:25.983 --> 56:28.930
and we both love this one. Here.

56:30.254 --> 56:31.790
- A chocolate wedding cake?
- Yeah.

56:31.855 --> 56:33.664
You know, how about
something more traditional?

56:33.724 --> 56:35.067
Like this one right here.

56:35.426 --> 56:36.564
- Look.
- Well...

56:39.696 --> 56:41.232
This is divine.
This is wonderful.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.505
Brooke ain't gonna eat that.
She's allergic to strawberries.

56:44.568 --> 56:46.138
Yes, of course.

56:47.337 --> 56:49.248
Darling, can we do this later?

56:49.306 --> 56:51.183
Channel 6 wants to
do a segment on me

56:51.241 --> 56:53.517
and I could really use
your beautiful face.

56:53.577 --> 56:56.751
Oh, well, it's just, I was
planning on buying new supplies.

56:56.814 --> 56:57.884
Hey, I can do it.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.485
Let me do it.

57:02.553 --> 57:04.658
No, no, no, Larry,
you have been great.

57:04.722 --> 57:07.601
More helpful than I could
have ever imagined, you know?

57:07.658 --> 57:11.970
It's just that this is our chance to
give these kids a real rec center.

57:12.029 --> 57:14.270
Yeah, but, Brooke, you're busy,
and I don't mind doing it.

57:14.331 --> 57:17.175
- This is all the money from our fundraiser.
- I can do it.

57:19.636 --> 57:20.876
All right.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.942
Okay, the list is in there.

57:25.209 --> 57:28.156
I am the new, mature Larry.
It will get done.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.354
- BROOKE: See you.
- All right. Bye-bye.

57:31.415 --> 57:33.395
Hey, before I go, though, I
think I'm gonna go down there

57:33.450 --> 57:35.452
and show them uppity folks
how to play some croquet.

57:35.519 --> 57:37.760
BROOKE: Have fun!
BO: Knock yourself out.

57:40.257 --> 57:43.602
It's real easy, ladies,
it's all in the form. Fore!

57:45.028 --> 57:46.439
(WOMEN GASP)

57:47.164 --> 57:48.165
See you!

57:51.034 --> 57:52.513
Get 'er done.

57:55.005 --> 57:56.643
Classic temp mistake.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.453
Do you always have to do that?

57:59.176 --> 58:01.417
You're taking your eye off
the ball, Mr. Guthrie.

58:02.012 --> 58:03.252
What are you talking about?

58:03.847 --> 58:06.885
“Brooke, I love
you ever so much.

58:06.950 --> 58:09.863
“Run away with me.
We'll be ever so happy.“.

58:10.754 --> 58:13.064
- I don't talk like that.
- You're right.

58:13.523 --> 58:15.093
You're way less charming.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.901
(IMITATING LARRY) You are more like,
“Yeah, babe, don't worry, babe.

58:17.961 --> 58:20.032
"I can totally handle getting
those supplies, babe."

58:20.097 --> 58:21.599
"I can get 'er done.“."

58:21.665 --> 58:23.235
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is what you sound like.

58:23.300 --> 58:24.608
(IN HIGH PITCHED
VOICE) “My name's Nyx,

58:24.668 --> 58:26.739
“and I think I'm the
cutest little fairy...“

58:26.803 --> 58:28.180
(YELLING)

58:30.274 --> 58:32.083
My underwear is
creeping up on me.

58:32.376 --> 58:35.516
Whoa! Run along! Just a wedgie.
Ain't no big deal.

58:37.047 --> 58:38.890
Yeah, that's real funny, Nyx.

58:39.383 --> 58:40.828
Yeah, it is.

58:42.252 --> 58:44.391
Stay focused, Mr. Guthrie,

58:44.455 --> 58:46.560
because if you don't get
me some more teeth,

58:46.623 --> 58:49.229
I'll have no choice but to take
away your greatest memory.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.966
Take it easy, I remember.

58:51.295 --> 58:55.004
What is he up to?
He's dancing around like a clown.

58:55.465 --> 58:58.071
Because you have a
case in two minutes.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.148
Just giving you a heads-up,

59:00.804 --> 59:03.444
lest you embarrass
yourself any further.

59:04.775 --> 59:06.448
LARRY: Focus, focus.

59:06.510 --> 59:08.717
This guy's completely nuts.

59:08.779 --> 59:11.783
Okay, Larry, it's
time to remind Brooke

59:14.418 --> 59:17.558
that you're always
gonna be a loser.

59:21.391 --> 59:22.802
Here we go.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:33.873
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:38.140
Larry, you're making
this way too easy on me.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.748
Oh, yeah.

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.493
If I don't win Tooth Fairy
of the Year for this,

01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.556
you'll know I got...

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.631
Robbed! (SIGHS)

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.707
BROOKE: Hey, guys, here he is!
Come here, come here, come here!

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.039
- There he is! Come here, guys!
- BO: Come on in!

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.908
BROOKE: Come here, he's here!
BO: Come on in.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:16.749
(CHANTING) Larry! Larry! Larry!

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.415
- BROOKE: All right, guys.
- Did you get us a Wii?

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.754
- A new telescope?
- More art supplies?

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:25.551
A new puppy?

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.126
Where are the supplies?

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.625
(SIGHS)

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.029
Everything okay?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.575
(MUMBLES) I lost the supplies.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.281
- You what?
- I lost the supplies.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.578
I don't know, it's bizarre.
They was in my car.

01:01:53.644 --> 01:01:55.681
I went in to get something
real quick in the store,

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:58.454
and I come out, they're gone.
Somebody done stole them!

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:01.189
You're really excited about
your toys that Larry brought?

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:02.423
ALL: Yeah!

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.896
Can't wait to see them, can you?

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.956
- No!
- I know, neither can I.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.527
Just unbelievable.

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:11.471
This was our chance to give
these kids a real rec center

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.735
and you blow it on one
of your pit stops?

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:16.004
What was it this time, Larry?

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.743
It was important.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:21.043
You know, Larry, since you
have come back into my life,

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:24.142
I have had to clean up one major
mess of yours after another.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.746
All right, Brooke, listen.

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.448
I'm gonna tell you, okay?

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.956
You're not gonna believe me,
but I'm gonna tell you.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:30.923
I'm just gonna be honest.
All right?

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.792
I'm a tooth fairy.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.198
I mean, not the Tooth Fairy.
I'm a tooth fairy.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.499
It's really weird.
They got it regionalized now.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.665
Who'd have thought they'd
have regionalized that?

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:48.710
But that's howl lost the stuff.
I go in to get this tooth from this kid...

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.745
A joke. You're gonna make a joke

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.711
- at a time like this.
- I ain't making a...

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.114
You really can't take
anything seriously, can you?

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.153
I ain't making a joke.
I go in to get this tooth...

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:01.951
God, I can't believe I actually
thought you had changed.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.551
It is so clear you are
never gonna grow up.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.787
Brooke, I ain't kidding...
Oh, boy.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.386
The kids are starting to worry.

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:09.486
(BABBLING)

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:11.958
Did something happen to
the supplies, Larry?

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:13.657
(SIGHS)

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.629
Oh, Larry, come on, man.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.535
<i>(BO SIGHS)</i>

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.937
What are we gonna tell the kids?

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:25.672
Well, why don't we
just tell them that...

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.009
BO: Nothing.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.081
I can't let these kids suffer
because of someone else's idiocy.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:36.351
You know, I'm gonna personally cover
the expenses to all new supplies.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:39.519
In fact, I'm gonna go
buy them right now.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.862
Let me do something.
Let me make up for what I done.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.231
Haven't you done enough?

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.525
So, I know you're a little
slow on the uptake,

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.754
but when you sprout wings and
a pair of pink coveralls,

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.728
- that means you're a tooth fairy.
(SCOFFS)

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.929
You do have some teeth
to collect tonight.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:19.423
I quit.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.234
Grow up. So you've had a
couple of bad breaks.

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.369
Bad breaks, seriously?

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.305
Let me tell you something
about bad breaks.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.366
If it wasn't for me having to
collect all them teeth for you,

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:30.945
none of this would've
happened to me.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:32.981
Now, Brooke's mad at me.
She hates my guts.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.573
She's gonna marry
Beauregard Billings.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.676
I mean, guess what
I get out of it.

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.550
The rest of my life to
try to forget about her.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.646
Thanks a lot.
You ruined my life.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.713
I ruined your life?

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:47.728
Take a second and remember what
your life was before we met.

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:52.028
Because the way I remember it, you were
a big fat washout going nowhere fast.

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:55.467
Well, there, see?
Something hasn't changed.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:05:00.497
Look, two days ago, I would've
encouraged you to quit.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.068
But I was wrong.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:07.476
You're actually not
horrible at this.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.749
So just collect six
more teeth by Sunday

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.184
and you save your
greatest memory.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:14.212
You know what?

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:17.116
Take it. I could careless.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.128
Go ahead and just take it.
Metro County Miracle. Who cares?

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:24.655
To think I actually started
to believe in you.

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:41.180
(VOICE BREAKING) Have a
nice life, Mr. Guthrie.

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.811
Wait.

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:52.750
HANK: I don't believe it.
Larry opened the garage early again?

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.289
That's crazy.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.096
Did you stay up again all night?

01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:00.593
Man, I appreciate your new work
ethic, but this is too much.

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:02.933
Yeah, man, you're
going overboard.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.030
Well, I feel like this is
what I need to do now.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:09.677
For what it's worth, I think
she's marrying the wrong guy.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.109
Thanks.

01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:17.374
<i>(ON RECORDER) Hey, this is Tom
Abrams calling for Larry Guthrie.</i>

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.010
<i>I'm on the Central
Florida Bowling Team,</i>

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.715
<i>and me and some of the guys were
trying to recreate your crazy roll.</i>

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:24.816
<i>And we were hoping maybe you could come
on by and show us how you did it.</i>

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.351
<i>Give me a call, 555-8621.
Thanks again.</i>

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.227
What do you say, Larry?

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.027
Wanna show these young'uns
a thing or two?

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.431
About what?

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.096
About the Metro
County Miracle, man.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.571
Come on, go and drop some
knowledge on those kids.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.205
Knowledge.
You want them to have knowledge,

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:42.834
tell them to go buy
some nacho cheese.

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.937
'Cause that's what I tripped
on when I made that shot.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.279
I mean, pure luck.
Metro County Miracle.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.851
Wait a minute.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.891
I still remember that.
That's not my best memory.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.159
Hey, hold on, I
gotta do something.

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.286
Where you going?

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.396
- How's it going? What's going on?
- Hey, Larry.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.660
Hey, can we have a word?

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.962
I love you, but I'm in a hurry.
We'll do it next time.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.335
Please, it's really important.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.333
Uh...

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:19.639
So what's on y'all's minds?

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.979
I lost that tooth.

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:25.842
Oh.

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:29.423
And I remember what
you said before.

01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:32.018
But then you told
all those stories.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:35.562
Now, I don't know
what to believe.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.757
So, please, just
tell me the truth.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.536
If I put my tooth
under my pillow,

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:44.936
will the tooth fairy
come, or not?

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.844
What are you doing here?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.881
What am I doing here?
I was a tooth fairy, remember?

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.574
What do you want?

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.811
I want my job back.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.616
What's the point?

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.317
You only have two days
to collect six teeth.

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.484
I mean, even if you
collect one tonight,

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.427
there aren't five cases
scheduled for tomorrow.

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.465
You can't possibly meet your quota.
It's hopeless.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:13.159
Nyx, listen.
But if there's a chance

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.430
to have Gabe believe in
the tooth fairy again,

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.062
I'm gonna take that chance.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.163
And it has nothing to do
with my greatest memory.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:22.974
Come on, Nyx, it's the
right thing to do.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.139
Please?

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:28.514
- Very well.
- Thank you.

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:33.477
I can't believe I actually
asked to be back in these.

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.481
Hey, you know what?

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:37.456
Now that I know the
Metro County Miracle's

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.652
not my greatest memory,

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:43.288
you think maybe
you could kind of

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.890
tell me what it was?

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.236
(SIGHS) Tell you what,
you get me Gabe's tooth

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.332
and your best memory will appear
on the back of the case card

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.932
in your pouch.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:03.741
I'll be in and out of there so fast,
they won't even know I was there.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:04.910
Kind of like college.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:11.718
Okay, Gabe, let's
go get your tooth.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:23.633
(SNAPPING) (YELLING IN PAIN)

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:26.872
I knew it! I knew it!

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.676
I thought we were friends.

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:30.734
- FRANK: Gabe!
- He's the tooth fairy.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.676
What's going on here?

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.738
Wow.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.680
I can't believe these are real.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:39.185
Are you all done
poking at me now?

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.689
For Pete's sake, you act like you ain't
never seen a tooth fairy before.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.923
- They're making you collect teeth?
- Yeah, they are.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:50.488
And my sentence ends tomorrow at
midnight, and I'm five teeth short.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.457
Well, what happens if you
don't get all the teeth?

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.934
Then I lose my best memory.
Forever.

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:57.138
Your best memory? What is it?

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.764
I don't know.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:02.743
You know what? Let's find out.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:03.869
It's probably something silly

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.571
about the first time I ate
a Slim Jim or something.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.743
Or bacon. I love bacon.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.212
I guarantee it has something
to do with bacon.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:25.457
Oh, man, I gotta
get this one back.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.625
Just collect five more teeth.

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:31.404
I can't.
There's no more cases tomorrow.

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:34.165
- There could be.
- What do you mean?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.734
You got me to believe in
the tooth fairy again.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.576
So, just do that
five more times.

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.047
Good idea.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:56.088
Check it out.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:11:00.726
<i>Life is good when you're around.</i>

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.933
<i>Nothing can bring me down.</i>

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:10.508
<i>I can't believe
what I have found.</i>

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:11.807
We're ready.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:15.179
Oh, man!
Thanks, guys, for everything.

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:16.273
Good luck, Larry.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:20.418
I hate to do this, but
it's tooth fairy rules.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:23.719
Remember, you never
saw the tooth fairy.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.603

of these invitations?

Luckily, my mom saved
this old baby tooth.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.416
I'm gonna go for it.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.483
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

how you did it,

but somehow you convinced five kids
to believe in the tooth fairy again.

Now, no temp or tooth fairy has ever
collected five teeth in one night.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:24.918
Well, I might be the first one.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:27.580

it to temps because it's so rare,

but it sure would be a shame
if someone left this box open.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:43.302
So, why, do they dry out or something
if you leave the box open?

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.830
Are you messing with me?

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.434
Yeah, little bit.

really appreciate it.

- I know. I know it's not.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.360
Can I talk to you
just for a second?

you and I went fishing?

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:58.639
and you took my hand and
put it in your hand.

01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:01.238
Well, I got to thinking
about that the other day,

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:05.983
and that was, by far, the greatest
all-time memory of my life.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:08.318
The single best memory.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.914
And at the time, I just
couldn't figure out

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.690

and kind and smart

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.560

if you wanna be with somebody else,

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.703
I get it.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:30.938
You gave me tons of chances.

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:36.281
But you deserve to be with somebody
whose greatest memory is about you.

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:44.290

trying to say here is...

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.032
No, relax.
It'll just take a second.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.405
Keep watching.
I'll be right back.

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:00.133
Tell me what happens.

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:07.804
Look, I know I offered to help
you if you ever needed me,

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.942
but five minutes before halftime?
You gotta be joking.

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:15.045
The regional tooth fairy called in
sick, so I need someone to fill in.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:19.081
The regional tooth fairy called in sick.
He never does any work.

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.250
(SIGHS) Can it wait
till after the game?

01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:25.930
Evidently that means no.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:27.627
Tell you what.

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:31.296
You get this tooth, and I won't mess with
you for the rest of football season.

01:25:32.094 --> 01:25:34.665
Yeah, I'll believe that
when I see pigs fly.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.367
Funny you should say that.

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:42.504
- LARRY: You got to be kidding me.
(CRUSHER SNORTING)

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:47.686
Well, I didn't
expect to see that.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:52.523
I thought you could use a little help.
Actually, all the help you could get.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:56.460
Well, Crusher, you hear that?
Looks like you and me's partners.

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:03.196
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go get me that tooth.

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:08.670
Hey, Crusher, we're like a superhero
team now flying around up here.

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:12.008
"We can call ourselves
“Fat Man and Hoggin'."

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:13.171
(CRUSHER SNORTS)
- All right, never mind.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:27.217
<i>Like a Popsicle on a hot day.</i>

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:30.923
<i>It almost seems to
take my breath away.</i>

01:26:30.986 --> 01:26:33.694
<i>The simple things in life.</i>

01:26:33.756 --> 01:26:37.966
<i>Make you think twice
on who you are.</i>

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:40.371
<i>What you're living.</i>

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:42.340
<i>Are you givin'.</i>

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:45.139
<i>A little bit of joy.</i>

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.949
<i>Sand between your toes.</i>

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:57.115
<i>Makes you know that
you don't need.</i>

01:26:57.179 --> 01:27:00.649
<i>All those fancy clothes.</i>

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.627
<i>Let a smile shine in.</i>

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:06.655
<i>And you'll be living
in who you are.</i>

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.929
<i>What you're saying.</i>

01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:13.201
<i>Is your heart an open door?</i>

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:31.148
<i>'Cause the wind can lead.</i>

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.895
<i>To a positive scene.</i>

01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:39.660
<i>Make a grin at the
little things.</i>

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:46.229
<i>Such as the world
proving I need a beat.</i>

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:48.204
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:16.967
<i>Like a Popsicle on a hot day.</i>

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:21.030
<i>It almost seems to
take my breath away.</i>

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.440
<i>The simple things in life.</i>

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:27.845
<i>Make you think twice
on who you are.</i>

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:30.110
<i>What you're living.</i>

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.049
<i>Are you givin'.</i>

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:34.815
<i>A little bit of joy.</i>

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:43.693
<i>Sand between your toes.</i>

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:47.063
<i>Makes you know that
you don't need.</i>

01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:50.535
<i>All those fancy clothes.</i>

01:28:50.592 --> 01:28:52.503
<i>Let a smile shine in.</i>

01:28:52.561 --> 01:28:56.441
<i>And you'll be living
in who you are.</i>

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.842
<i>What you're saying.</i>

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:05.580
<i>Is your heart an open door?</i>
