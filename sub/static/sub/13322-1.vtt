WEBVTT

00:01.687 --> 00:03.898
This is really hard
because I still love you.

00:04.018 --> 00:06.252
If you're ever not feeling this,

00:06.275 --> 00:07.693
then just be honest with me.

00:07.693 --> 00:10.971
'Cause I'd rather be hurt than surprised.

00:11.015 --> 00:12.493
I'm not really sure I'm into guys.

00:12.515 --> 00:15.289
I mean, I've never even kissed
a girl, so how would I know?

00:15.309 --> 00:17.953
Arbiter is responsible
for the death of Jack.

00:17.953 --> 00:20.831
And I've just learned that
Justina Marks works for Arbiter.

00:20.831 --> 00:22.166
Do you realize what you've just done?

00:22.166 --> 00:23.393
- I don't care.
- You will.

00:23.413 --> 00:25.478
Is it true you made
these false allegations

00:25.489 --> 00:28.167
because she found out you were
having sex with your foster brother?

00:28.167 --> 00:30.102
- We're gonna fight this.
- I can't sue her.

00:30.157 --> 00:31.686
We absolutely can.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.705
We can't because it's true.

01:49.259 --> 01:50.712
Oh, my God.

01:50.832 --> 01:53.846
Please tell me that I am
misunderstanding this, Callie.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.557
When did this happen?

01:55.557 --> 01:57.268
Idyllwild.

01:58.949 --> 02:01.674
It was only once. I thought
I couldn't get adopted.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.836
- Why would you...
- Honey, honey, just...

02:04.178 --> 02:05.752
I know that there were
complications, Callie,

02:05.762 --> 02:07.726
but why wouldn't you think
you were getting adopted?

02:10.757 --> 02:15.321
Um, remember when Rita was
accused of hitting Carmen?

02:16.319 --> 02:18.478
Well, I got her to
admit that she was lying

02:18.491 --> 02:20.145
and I recorded it.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.545
When I told her I wasn't going
to let her get away with it,

02:22.579 --> 02:26.127
she told me that if I ruined her
life that she would ruin mine.

02:26.383 --> 02:30.540
Okay, so wait, what does this have
to do with you getting adopted?

02:30.595 --> 02:33.306
Carmen knew that I was seeing

02:33.426 --> 02:35.755
Brandon while I was at GU.

02:36.225 --> 02:38.604
Wait, after the restraining order?

02:42.615 --> 02:44.793
So when I thought that

02:44.821 --> 02:46.543
Rita was going to lose her license

02:46.578 --> 02:48.169
and her career and everything,

02:48.210 --> 02:51.869
I sent her the recording
of what Carmen had said,

02:52.208 --> 02:54.615
and I figured that that meant

02:54.628 --> 02:56.890
Carmen was going to blow up my adoption

02:56.925 --> 03:00.038
by telling my social workers
everything Brandon and I had done,

03:00.100 --> 03:02.257
and I figured if for
whatever reason she didn't,

03:02.278 --> 03:04.284
- that for sure...
- Rita would.

03:05.349 --> 03:06.815
Wait a minute, Rita knew?

03:06.857 --> 03:09.457
Don't get mad at Rita. She
thought everything was over.

03:09.492 --> 03:11.020
Yeah, like we did.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.842
She just wanted me to have a family.

- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

04:01.123 --> 04:04.512
So what are the different
types of potential energy?

04:05.787 --> 04:06.725
Mat?

04:06.774 --> 04:10.384
Um, there's chemical,
gravitational, mechanical,

04:10.411 --> 04:12.294
- and, um...
- There's one more.

04:12.854 --> 04:14.154
Nuclear.

04:15.233 --> 04:18.147
- Nice of you to join us, Mr. Stratos.
- Sorry.

04:20.281 --> 04:24.225
And what's an everyday example
of potential energy at work?

04:26.273 --> 04:29.533
I'll give you a hint... it
was covered in the chapter.

04:29.896 --> 04:32.715
Anyone know the answer?

04:34.116 --> 04:36.484
Is it true Jude kissed you?

04:37.816 --> 04:39.389
Who said that?

04:39.917 --> 04:42.718
Well, I mean, he did
it at your locker, so,

04:42.752 --> 04:44.300
like, everyone saw it.

04:44.420 --> 04:46.677
So what if he did?

04:47.163 --> 04:49.461
Isn't he gay?

04:52.547 --> 04:55.004
It really isn't any of
your business, Daria.

04:55.038 --> 04:56.940
What about Connor?

04:56.972 --> 04:58.694
What about Connor?

04:58.814 --> 05:01.037
He lives in LA.

05:06.553 --> 05:08.230
Whoa!

05:09.782 --> 05:13.648
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not. I'm very much not okay.

05:13.697 --> 05:15.294
Yeah, well, I got that.

05:17.411 --> 05:19.237
Is there anything I can do?

05:20.282 --> 05:22.108
Are you back together with Lexi?

05:22.228 --> 05:26.583
No. I mean, we talked
about it, but, you know...

05:26.645 --> 05:27.613
Good.

05:28.464 --> 05:30.560
You want to have sex?

05:33.686 --> 05:35.007
Mariana?

05:36.111 --> 05:37.054
Hey.

05:37.174 --> 05:39.668
Hey, uh, is Nick okay?

05:40.623 --> 05:44.746
Is he here? I texted him,
but he hasn't answered me.

05:44.866 --> 05:48.405
Well, he was late during first
period and he seemed kind of off.

05:48.525 --> 05:50.874
Like, really off.

05:51.123 --> 05:52.728
I gotta run.

05:58.545 --> 06:01.346
- Don't... don't do that.
- All right, I'm sorry, man.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.538
- I'm just messing with you.
- Yeah, jeez.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.980
I... I think Mariana is looking for you.

06:06.007 --> 06:08.442
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm looking for her too.

06:09.964 --> 06:13.034
Uh, hey, are you... are
you sick or something?

06:13.062 --> 06:14.466
No, why?

06:14.687 --> 06:16.218
Just checking.

06:17.087 --> 06:18.975
You're a good friend.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.973
Oh, yeah? Thanks, man.

06:23.825 --> 06:26.645
How would you like to do your
good friend a little favor?

06:34.744 --> 06:39.039
_

06:41.191 --> 06:44.780
_

06:49.856 --> 06:54.993
_

06:59.239 --> 07:01.354
_

07:07.302 --> 07:08.831
Why didn't you tell us?

07:09.534 --> 07:12.200
I didn't want to destroy the family.

07:13.048 --> 07:15.772
As soon as we found out
that I could get adopted,

07:15.801 --> 07:18.076
we stopped everything right away.

07:18.196 --> 07:20.083
We haven't done anything since.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.778
We are family now.

07:22.785 --> 07:24.724
That's the only reason you
let us go through with it?

07:24.756 --> 07:26.626
Because you didn't want to
destroy the family, Callie?

07:26.658 --> 07:29.393
No. No, of course not.

07:30.430 --> 07:33.262
I love you both and I
want you to be my moms.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.624
I can't believe this was going on
all this time right under our noses.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.443
- How did we not see this was happening?
- Stef, it's not the time.

07:37.471 --> 07:38.838
It's not the time.

07:40.949 --> 07:43.108
We love you too, Callie.

07:44.086 --> 07:46.913
It's... it's just a lot
to wrap our heads around.

07:52.491 --> 07:54.966
If we had told you,
what would you have done?

07:57.309 --> 08:00.294
- Hey, you got a sec?
- Mike, what are you doing here?

08:00.331 --> 08:02.236
Is Nick Stratos in school today?

08:02.494 --> 08:04.330
- Uh...
- I don't...

08:05.852 --> 08:08.666
Let me check. Why? Is everything okay?

08:08.786 --> 08:11.040
Uh, there was a fire
at his dad's warehouse.

08:11.069 --> 08:13.040
- What?
- He's not in class.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.728
- What happened?
- Looks like arson.

08:29.633 --> 08:31.082
Hey.

08:31.987 --> 08:33.878
Are you okay?

08:34.587 --> 08:36.058
You don't look so good.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.659
Are you feeling okay?

08:40.073 --> 08:43.979
Look, um, I'm so, so sorry

08:44.341 --> 08:46.848
that you saw Mat and me in the garage.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.797
I know what you're thinking,

08:48.917 --> 08:52.050
but I swear, that's not what's going on.

08:53.064 --> 08:55.260
I'm gonna tell you everything, okay?

08:55.380 --> 08:57.027
Everything.

08:58.998 --> 09:00.455
Okay.

09:01.556 --> 09:03.614
Mat wrote me a note

09:03.657 --> 09:06.200
telling me that he still loved me.

09:06.591 --> 09:09.924
At least, that's what
he says. I never got it.

09:10.044 --> 09:13.518
I think Zoey must have taken it out
of my bag at rehearsal or something.

09:13.638 --> 09:16.460
Anyway, he told me about it

09:16.503 --> 09:20.647
and he asked me to get back
together with him. But...

09:23.175 --> 09:24.567
I told him no.

09:24.610 --> 09:26.784
- Pfft.
- No, I did.

09:27.450 --> 09:31.233
Because I'm with you now
and I really like you.

09:33.552 --> 09:36.097
And what you saw in the
garage, that was just

09:36.783 --> 09:40.058
us saying goodbye. I swear.

09:40.869 --> 09:43.347
That's not what it looked like.

09:43.906 --> 09:45.361
I know.

09:45.803 --> 09:48.114
But that's the truth. Honest to God.

09:48.136 --> 09:49.889
Yeah, sure. Sure it is. You know what?

09:49.940 --> 09:51.823
You're just telling me
all this because you guys

09:51.830 --> 09:53.975
want to use the warehouse for your show.

09:54.374 --> 09:56.228
No, that's not...

09:56.348 --> 09:58.851
I don't even care about the stupid show.

09:58.887 --> 10:02.156
You said... you said you
weren't going to surprise me.

10:02.344 --> 10:06.502
I know. I know, and I'm
sorry. But that's not...

10:06.705 --> 10:07.814
Hey,

10:08.437 --> 10:10.371
shouldn't you two be in class?

10:10.654 --> 10:11.908
Oh, um...

10:12.190 --> 10:14.444
- I'm sorry. We were just...
- Yeah, I can see that.

10:14.564 --> 10:16.132
Let's go.

10:16.755 --> 10:18.515
- Can't we just have...
- No.

10:18.566 --> 10:20.487
Let's go now.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.877
Okay, wait, so you think Nick did it?

10:28.882 --> 10:30.517
Well, we'd like to talk to him about it.

10:30.550 --> 10:32.152
Wait.

10:32.484 --> 10:33.745
Yes?

10:34.013 --> 10:35.796
Okay. No, I'll be right there.

10:36.752 --> 10:39.493
Apparently, Mr. Stratos is here,

10:39.526 --> 10:41.328
demanding to speak to us.

10:43.859 --> 10:46.467
Mr. Stratos? Want to come on in?

10:53.339 --> 10:54.481
Hi.

10:54.481 --> 10:56.546
Mike was just telling
us about your warehouse.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.328
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

10:58.335 --> 11:00.426
Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.

11:01.016 --> 11:02.979
Uh, why... why would you sue us?

11:03.008 --> 11:04.842
I never gave permission
for the school to use it

11:04.870 --> 11:06.980
to put on that play. So you're liable.

11:07.001 --> 11:09.015
Yes, you did. We spoke on the phone.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.646
I spoke with someone on the
phone. Nick connected us.

11:11.675 --> 11:14.131
Wasn't me, 'cause I
didn't speak with anyone.

11:14.661 --> 11:16.269
Now get Nick in here.
I want to talk to him.

11:16.389 --> 11:17.993
He's not here. He didn't
come to school today.

11:18.022 --> 11:21.057
Then what's his car doing
here? It's right out front.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.809
Oh. What's going on?

11:32.831 --> 11:34.287
Nothing, love. What do you need?

11:34.519 --> 11:37.563
- I wanted to talk to Mama.
- About what?

11:37.889 --> 11:41.424
- I saw Nick and he was...
- You saw Nick?

11:41.772 --> 11:43.083
Here at school?

11:43.134 --> 11:44.781
He seemed really weird.

11:45.822 --> 11:48.017
Okay, come with me.

11:52.922 --> 11:53.929
Callie,

11:54.182 --> 11:56.515
would you go back to
class? We'll talk later.

12:18.885 --> 12:22.957
_

12:23.077 --> 12:26.950
_

12:33.899 --> 12:38.297
Well, I just saw Nick
and he seemed super weird.

12:38.326 --> 12:39.804
So I take it you're the girl...

12:39.804 --> 12:41.681
the one who's been messing with my son.

12:41.973 --> 12:45.296
Mariana, this is Nick's
father, Mr. Stratos.

12:45.745 --> 12:47.225
Oh. Hi.

12:47.245 --> 12:49.244
What do you mean, "super weird"?

12:49.547 --> 12:52.345
Um, well, he was just...

12:52.359 --> 12:54.954
It's important you tell us
everything that happened.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.997
Okay. Well,

12:58.461 --> 13:00.345
Nick was upset because he thought that

13:00.359 --> 13:03.279
Mat and I were getting back
together. We're not, but

13:03.953 --> 13:06.141
- he didn't want to believe me.
- Oh, come on.

13:06.170 --> 13:09.301
You have been playing my son
and he finally figured it out.

13:09.315 --> 13:11.116
- Okay... okay.
- Of course he's upset.

13:11.236 --> 13:13.692
No, it... it was more than that. He...

13:14.329 --> 13:15.481
he seemed off.

13:15.496 --> 13:16.880
Off in what way, Mariana?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.271
I don't know, why?

13:19.496 --> 13:21.568
What happened? Did Nick do something?

13:22.328 --> 13:24.838
Not... not that we know
of, but there was a fire

13:24.852 --> 13:26.685
at the warehouse and we just...

13:26.893 --> 13:28.661
- we don't...
- You think Nick did it?

13:29.010 --> 13:31.314
Hey, I just confirmed, he's not in class

13:31.322 --> 13:34.343
- and no one's seen him.
- Then where the hell is he?

13:34.463 --> 13:36.684
I swear to God, you
people are incompetent.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.546
Why don't we go and see if
Nick's car is here, shall we?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.886
His car was right there!

13:42.212 --> 13:44.857
So the kids just come
and go as they please?

13:45.154 --> 13:47.813
Mariana, why don't you
go back to class, okay?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.015
Uh, Mr. Stratos,

13:50.631 --> 13:52.428
do you... do you think...

13:52.826 --> 13:54.906
do you think that Nick
would, uh, hurt himself

13:54.942 --> 13:57.420
- or anyone else?
- What are you asking me?

13:57.540 --> 13:59.884
Does he have access to any weapons?

14:00.449 --> 14:02.072
Weapons?

14:02.347 --> 14:04.738
Do you keep a gun in the house?

14:07.005 --> 14:08.585
I have a gun.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.744
Yes. I have a carry permit.

14:10.864 --> 14:13.048
But I keep it locked in the car.

14:13.168 --> 14:14.859
Okay, do you think that we could check it

14:14.873 --> 14:16.011
and make sure that it's still there?

14:16.047 --> 14:18.061
- We don't need to.
- Humor me.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.019
There's no point in...

14:22.727 --> 14:24.655
So let's give Nick a call again,

14:24.688 --> 14:26.023
find out where he is.

14:27.509 --> 14:30.827
Get down... everybody
down. Stop the car now!

14:30.947 --> 14:33.204
Turn off the engine!

14:34.798 --> 14:37.015
Come out with your hands in the air!

14:39.493 --> 14:43.210
Whoa! This is a little bit over
the top for cutting a class.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.260
Okay. What are you doing in Nick's car?

14:45.303 --> 14:48.035
I... I just borrowed it
so I could take Emma out.

14:48.086 --> 14:50.013
In the middle of the
school day? Nice, Jesus!

14:50.049 --> 14:51.940
So Nick is here? Nick's on campus?

14:52.331 --> 14:54.809
Look, it's not his fault. I'm the
one who asked him to borrow the car.

14:54.817 --> 14:56.983
Nick's got a gun. As far
as we know, he is here.

14:57.004 --> 14:58.678
- Yeah.
- We've got to lock down this school now.

14:58.693 --> 14:59.750
- Let's get everyone...
- Are you serious?

14:59.765 --> 15:01.619
- I'll call it in!
- Stef, where are you going?

15:01.663 --> 15:03.177
I'm going to find our daughter!

15:04.858 --> 15:07.199
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.745
- You okay?
- Um, no, I need to tell you something.

15:12.447 --> 15:13.589
What?

15:15.966 --> 15:17.392
Moms know.

15:20.985 --> 15:22.243
Know what?

15:23.014 --> 15:24.989
What we did in Idyllwild.

15:34.072 --> 15:35.278
How?

15:40.088 --> 15:41.885
I told them.

15:45.097 --> 15:48.420
Lena Code blue. This is a
code blue. This is not a drill.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.246
- I repeat...
- Get into a classroom, right now!

15:51.264 --> 15:53.919
Come on, drop your bag. Get
into a classroom, please.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.909
Out of the hallway, everybody!

15:55.942 --> 15:59.848
This is not a drill. I
repeat, this is not a drill.

16:03.906 --> 16:05.998
Mom? Mom, what's going on?

16:06.016 --> 16:08.470
It's okay. Just go ahead and get into
your classroom right now, sweetheart.

16:08.479 --> 16:10.133
All right. Do you know where
your sister is... Mariana?

16:10.155 --> 16:11.118
- No, no, no.
- Okay, honey.

16:11.133 --> 16:12.110
- Mom?
- Yeah, love?

16:12.147 --> 16:15.661
- I love you.
- I love you too, sweetheart. Just get in your class.

16:16.566 --> 16:18.841
I repeat, this is not a drill.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.754
This is a code blue. Code blue.

16:22.587 --> 16:25.782
Code blue, this is a code
blue. This is not a drill.

16:26.130 --> 16:28.189
I repeat, this is not a drill.

16:28.210 --> 16:31.145
- What does "code blue" mean?
- It means someone has a gun on campus.

16:31.536 --> 16:34.079
Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get
shot so I don't have to see Moms.

16:34.539 --> 16:36.376
Brandon, what a stupid thing to say.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.215
Code blue, this is a code blue.

16:43.247 --> 16:46.389
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah... I... I'm fine.

16:46.418 --> 16:49.411
I'm just a sub, so I've never
been through anything like this.

16:49.947 --> 16:52.128
Get those blinds, okay?

16:53.142 --> 16:56.808
Everyone, we have to stay
quiet and do what I say.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.565
I need this table in front
of this door right now.

17:04.915 --> 17:06.749
Stack the stools on the table.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.849
Okay, let's do it.

17:11.988 --> 17:13.611
Get on here.

17:13.644 --> 17:15.762
Now everyone down against the wall, okay?

17:15.777 --> 17:18.682
And remember, you have to
be totally quiet. All right?

17:19.074 --> 17:22.190
- Code blue. This is a code blue.
- You okay?

17:22.987 --> 17:25.287
I repeat, this is not a drill.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.223
This is a code blue. Code blue.

17:28.810 --> 17:31.186
Code blue. This is a code blue.

17:31.222 --> 17:35.113
This is not a drill. I
repeat, this is not a drill.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.266
This is a code blue. Code blue.

17:38.352 --> 17:40.461
Code blue. This is a code blue.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.156
This is not a drill.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.910
We are on lockdown. Get out of here, run!

17:45.030 --> 17:47.229
Go as far away from the school
as possible. Don't come back.

17:47.258 --> 17:48.591
Go, go, go.

17:49.982 --> 17:51.945
Code blue. This is a code blue.

17:51.974 --> 17:53.699
This is not a drill.

17:53.981 --> 17:57.422
This is the final announcement
you will hear over the P.A.

18:00.508 --> 18:02.102
Shh, shh.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.457
Wait, we don't open the door for anyone.

18:05.493 --> 18:08.855
Let me in, please. It's
Mariana... Mariana Foster.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.218
Mariana. We have to let her in.

18:10.218 --> 18:13.521
Absolutely not! We don't
know who else is out there.

18:13.557 --> 18:16.810
She could be with the shooter.
She could be the shooter. Sit down.

18:18.107 --> 18:19.838
Open the door, please.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.499
Give me this.

18:22.619 --> 18:24.570
Open the door, please!

18:25.048 --> 18:26.911
Please, let me in.

18:33.801 --> 18:36.728
Please open the door! I'm
stuck out here in the hallway!

18:37.808 --> 18:39.814
Open the door!

18:47.756 --> 18:49.704
Open the door, please!

18:50.827 --> 18:53.195
Please let me in!

18:58.731 --> 19:01.911
Okay, they've called in SWAT. They
should be in within five minutes.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.592
Excuse me! Excuse me!

19:07.635 --> 19:09.787
- Yes?
- Excuse me, I got one of those calls...

19:09.838 --> 19:12.186
a robocall saying the
school is going on lockdown?

19:12.236 --> 19:14.222
- Yes, that's right.
- What is going on?

19:14.482 --> 19:17.257
Um, listen, there is no need to panic,

19:17.286 --> 19:19.438
but we have reason to believe
that there might be someone

19:19.467 --> 19:20.742
on campus with a gun.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.989
Wait, wait. Wait, excuse me.
I want to take my son home now.

19:23.109 --> 19:24.547
I understand, but that's not possible.

19:24.591 --> 19:25.924
The best thing for you and for your son

19:25.953 --> 19:28.692
is for you to go to the designated
meeting area and wait there.

19:28.693 --> 19:31.285
- I am not leaving here without my son.
- Listen, I know this is scary.

19:31.285 --> 19:33.430
- It's scary.
- It is. My kids are in there too.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.814
We have a job to do and it is not
safe for you to be here right now.

19:36.837 --> 19:40.252
Officer Johnston, please... he's going
to escort you to the meeting area.

19:40.279 --> 19:41.792
- And please wait.
- But we have...

19:41.833 --> 19:43.438
- It's going to be fine.
- ... talk to our kids and...

19:43.558 --> 19:45.066
It's going to be fine, I promise you.

19:45.095 --> 19:46.869
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- It will be fine.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.666
This is ridiculous.

20:07.939 --> 20:10.136
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.463
Everything is going to be okay.

20:13.770 --> 20:15.694
All right? I promise you.

20:15.814 --> 20:18.343
You're good. I got you.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.250
- You're okay.
- _

20:20.279 --> 20:22.093
- _
- I'm going to be right back, okay?

20:22.213 --> 20:24.052
Okay. I gotta go.

20:27.576 --> 20:31.639
_

20:31.685 --> 20:35.204
_

20:35.777 --> 20:37.568
Why are they asking about Nick?

20:40.108 --> 20:42.472
The warehouse burned down.

20:43.269 --> 20:44.309
What?

20:44.860 --> 20:46.964
With all the sets and everything.

20:47.445 --> 20:49.433
I heard when I was in the office.

20:49.798 --> 20:51.291
I'm really sorry.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.015
Maybe they think Nick's,
like, lost it or something.

20:55.438 --> 20:57.814
I never found Mariana. I assume
she got back to her class.

20:57.830 --> 20:59.084
Are all the kids accounted for?

20:59.204 --> 21:00.265
Uh, not yet.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.642
But we haven't gotten roll call
back from all the classes yet.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.059
We have Emma and Jesus here, of course.

21:05.179 --> 21:07.319
And Jude is in his class.

21:07.371 --> 21:09.377
But we still haven't
heard anything back about

21:09.754 --> 21:11.782
Mariana, Callie, or Brandon.

21:11.846 --> 21:15.265
- What is taking so long?
- Well, we have a sub in one class,

21:15.314 --> 21:17.062
so it might just take a little longer.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.940
Don't worry.

21:25.014 --> 21:25.982
What?

21:27.071 --> 21:30.578
- What?
- Sorry. Sorry, I just...

21:30.914 --> 21:33.991
this is what happens when I get nervous.

21:35.301 --> 21:36.413
Emma, come on.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.906
'Kay? Take a deep breath.

21:40.784 --> 21:43.044
It's okay. We're going to be fine.

21:45.368 --> 21:48.283
I just can't believe this
is all because of Nick.

21:49.865 --> 21:51.581
Did he seem upset

21:51.802 --> 21:53.819
when you saw him this morning?

21:54.543 --> 21:55.540
Yeah.

21:55.581 --> 21:59.029
Yeah, I guess he was
kind of acting strange.

22:00.849 --> 22:03.190
He thanked me for being a good friend.

22:04.106 --> 22:05.839
Well, you are a good friend.

22:06.484 --> 22:08.030
But it wasn't like that.

22:09.844 --> 22:11.212
The way he was talking,

22:11.276 --> 22:13.281
it was more heavy.

22:13.716 --> 22:18.004
Like he was going away
for a long time, or like...

22:19.474 --> 22:22.431
Like he was going to
do something to himself?

22:28.880 --> 22:32.982
Hey, buddy, it's your dad. Please call me.

22:33.959 --> 22:35.577
Don't do anything stupid.

22:36.174 --> 22:37.495
Please.

22:46.549 --> 22:48.381
We should get roll done.

22:51.778 --> 22:53.105
Here.

22:59.869 --> 23:02.698
Miranda Collins? Abby Wheeler?

23:03.428 --> 23:04.906
Dean Kudrow?

23:05.828 --> 23:07.335
Leo James?

23:07.353 --> 23:09.324
_

23:09.347 --> 23:11.016
Matthew Johnson?

23:11.670 --> 23:13.282
Stephen Evans?

23:13.317 --> 23:17.914
_

23:28.387 --> 23:30.734
_

23:40.907 --> 23:43.713
Hey, turn that off.

23:43.759 --> 23:45.133
You're gonna get us killed.

23:56.355 --> 23:57.636
What are you doing?

23:57.932 --> 23:59.757
Oh, um...

24:00.938 --> 24:03.745
whenever I get scared or whatever,

24:04.174 --> 24:06.945
I do the sign of the cross on my hand.

24:06.977 --> 24:08.655
It makes me feel better,

24:08.957 --> 24:11.791
like I'm talking to God, or...

24:12.533 --> 24:15.094
I know, it's dumb.

24:15.355 --> 24:17.859
No. I don't think so.

24:25.806 --> 24:27.631
Just like that.

24:41.803 --> 24:42.910
So...

24:44.614 --> 24:46.828
you and Robby?

24:47.018 --> 24:49.611
Yeah, me and Robby.

24:49.634 --> 24:52.984
We're talking about the
same guy here, right?

24:53.104 --> 24:54.695
Wrestling Robby, not...

24:54.724 --> 24:57.685
- Yeah, him.
- With the... the hairy arms?

24:58.619 --> 25:00.201
Yeah.

25:02.478 --> 25:04.611
Ugh, they were so hairy.

25:04.617 --> 25:06.367
When he would put his arms around me,

25:06.385 --> 25:07.845
he would tickle my ears.

25:12.824 --> 25:15.033
How long were you guys together?

25:15.448 --> 25:16.824
Couple months.

25:17.919 --> 25:19.843
I think you're better off anyway.

25:19.963 --> 25:21.894
I didn't see you guys together.

25:23.285 --> 25:24.763
Apparently, he didn't either.

25:25.337 --> 25:26.913
Yeah, well, you deserve a lot more

25:26.930 --> 25:29.075
than some knucklehead who cheats on you.

25:31.626 --> 25:34.419
Okay, we got the last
roll from the sub's room.

25:34.738 --> 25:37.578
And it looks like Brandon
and Callie are in there.

25:37.949 --> 25:40.175
Wait, I thought the sub
was doing junior high?

25:40.210 --> 25:42.604
Yeah, they must've gotten
pulled in during the lockdown.

25:42.836 --> 25:44.250
Thank God. Looks like they're the ones

25:44.279 --> 25:46.174
taking the roll and sending the emails.

25:46.215 --> 25:47.925
- Let me see.
- Okay.

25:51.430 --> 25:55.800
_

25:57.399 --> 26:01.352
_

26:03.434 --> 26:06.031
_

26:11.068 --> 26:12.390
Wait... wait a minute.

26:13.630 --> 26:15.769
This can't be the last
class. Mariana's not here.

26:15.816 --> 26:17.583
No one... no one has Mariana.

26:17.595 --> 26:19.292
Okay, okay, I'm sure she's fine.

26:19.334 --> 26:21.066
You know, we probably just
missed her name somewhere.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.660
You don't think she's with Nick, do you?

26:22.683 --> 26:24.254
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

26:27.529 --> 26:29.482
_

26:29.500 --> 26:31.743
Mama... Mama, where is she?

26:31.772 --> 26:34.131
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Shh, keep your voice down.

26:36.200 --> 26:40.657
_

26:40.686 --> 26:44.605
_

26:44.872 --> 26:47.027
- Lena? Lena!
- Hey, hey, hey!

26:47.073 --> 26:48.105
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.803
- I'm going to find Mariana.
- Get down, get down.

26:49.861 --> 26:51.907
Mike, if she is not in a classroom,

26:51.936 --> 26:53.593
that means she's in this
building somewhere alone!

26:53.627 --> 26:55.471
- I'm gonna go find her. Let me go.
- Listen to me,

26:55.591 --> 26:56.573
-  I know you're scared.
- Get off of me!

26:56.693 --> 26:58.607
I know you're scared. But
nobody's going out there

26:58.648 --> 27:00.688
to be target practice
for somebody with a gun.

27:00.808 --> 27:02.676
I know it's not what you
want to hear right now,

27:03.360 --> 27:05.412
but you are not leaving this room.

27:05.823 --> 27:07.522
Maybe she's hiding out somewhere.

27:08.831 --> 27:10.889
Unless she's with Nick?

27:23.731 --> 27:26.119
Stef, we have all of the kids

27:26.814 --> 27:28.339
except Mariana.

27:31.544 --> 27:33.793
Move that perimeter back!

27:39.908 --> 27:41.694
What the hell is taking so long?

27:41.896 --> 27:43.722
I mean, seriously, why aren't
they telling us anything?

27:43.774 --> 27:45.926
- Quiet.
- You know what? We're all just...

27:46.395 --> 27:49.455
- we're just sitting ducks.
- Shut up. Okay? You're scaring them.

27:50.052 --> 27:53.657
You guys? There's
something wrong with Stasia.

27:58.143 --> 28:00.432
Hey, what's going on?

28:00.907 --> 28:01.962
Can you talk?

28:02.014 --> 28:05.631
- I have...
- She... she has diabetes.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.962
This... this happened one time

28:08.082 --> 28:09.909
and the teacher gave her sugar, I think.

28:09.967 --> 28:13.027
Okay, then we need sugar. Does
anyone have anything sweet?

28:13.039 --> 28:15.931
- Guys?
- Sugar. We need sugar. Nothing?

28:15.943 --> 28:18.104
- Go, go, go!
- All right, let's go, let's go! Move, move!

28:18.151 --> 28:19.565
If Nick's inside, he's hiding.

28:19.577 --> 28:21.449
So we've got to get everyone out

28:21.472 --> 28:22.788
and do a clean sweep with dogs.

28:22.805 --> 28:24.823
We've got a secure area for the students.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.467
We're going to start quietly evacuating,

28:27.490 --> 28:28.794
one classroom at a time.

28:28.829 --> 28:31.611
We've got the master key to
unlock and get everyone out.

28:31.651 --> 28:33.639
Just wanted to let you know.

28:33.894 --> 28:36.078
Sit tight and we'll get to you soon, okay?

28:36.198 --> 28:38.702
Any word on Mariana?

28:39.599 --> 28:41.501
No.

28:44.626 --> 28:46.981
It's going to be okay.
We're going to find her.

28:47.662 --> 28:49.329
I love you.

28:49.363 --> 28:51.527
I love you too.

28:52.370 --> 28:55.201
Nothing? We need sugar,
guys. Anything sweet.

28:55.224 --> 28:57.653
- What do we do?
- I don't... I don't know.

28:57.711 --> 29:01.154
- Nobody's got candy or...
- Brandon, look in here.

29:05.629 --> 29:07.415
I think there's a...

29:07.448 --> 29:11.142
I think that there's, like,
an emergency bag somewhere.

29:11.171 --> 29:12.735
What, an emerg... What does it look like?

29:12.787 --> 29:15.830
Yeah, you know, like a
backpack or something.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.690
I found it! I got... I got it.

29:17.927 --> 29:20.877
Give me that. I got it. Okay.

29:20.924 --> 29:22.170
We should hurry up.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.650
Hold on.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.282
Okay. Okay, I got you.

29:43.593 --> 29:46.149
He's just doing this
'cause he wants attention.

29:46.269 --> 29:47.563
What are you talking about?

29:47.683 --> 29:49.378
He's not straight.

29:50.172 --> 29:51.824
Well, you're not.

29:51.859 --> 29:53.952
You don't know what you're
talking about, Daria.

29:53.975 --> 29:56.038
Yeah, why are you being such a douche?

29:56.363 --> 29:59.116
Well, excuse me if I don't
want my friend to get hurt.

30:04.206 --> 30:06.101
Hands on your head.
Everyone against the wall.

30:06.159 --> 30:07.642
We're coming in.

30:08.413 --> 30:10.998
It's all right, it's all right.

30:11.989 --> 30:14.145
It's okay, it's okay.

30:16.313 --> 30:18.765
All right, let's move.
Come on, kids. Let's go.

30:18.939 --> 30:20.689
Go, go, go.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.324
Go, go.

30:22.444 --> 30:23.900
Keep moving.

30:39.248 --> 30:41.178
- Go, go, go.
- All right, let's go.

30:41.212 --> 30:43.212
- Come on.
- Hey, you okay?

30:43.259 --> 30:45.026
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You okay?

30:45.073 --> 30:46.261
Yeah, go.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.243
Why?

31:21.454 --> 31:24.214
I just couldn't lie anymore, Brandon.

31:27.616 --> 31:30.025
I just needed it to be over.

31:38.617 --> 31:40.211
Well, it is.

31:47.943 --> 31:49.328
I'm sorry.

31:52.279 --> 31:54.174
Don't apologize.

31:57.819 --> 31:59.326
Not to me.

32:10.977 --> 32:14.810
Back, back.

32:17.824 --> 32:19.425
All right, let's go.

32:24.178 --> 32:26.178
Get out of the school.

32:29.004 --> 32:30.924
Hey, did you find Mariana yet?

32:31.044 --> 32:33.091
Just go to the holding area. We'll
come get you as soon as we can.

32:33.105 --> 32:34.417
- Okay?
- Okay, I love you.

32:34.446 --> 32:35.844
- I love you too.
- Where is she?

32:35.866 --> 32:36.916
- Why can't they find her?
- It's okay.

32:36.974 --> 32:38.452
- I'm not going back there.
- Lena...

32:38.474 --> 32:40.074
- Why can't they find...
- Get down, please.

32:40.074 --> 32:41.654
Why can't they find her?

32:42.125 --> 32:44.289
Why can't they find her?

33:10.714 --> 33:13.068
Come on, clear.

33:14.829 --> 33:16.966
This way!

33:19.017 --> 33:21.502
Get down, get down, get down!

33:21.545 --> 33:23.241
Down! Shh! Shh!

33:24.502 --> 33:27.516
- Shots fired! Shots fired!
- Stef! Stef! Stef!

33:27.636 --> 33:29.334
Foster!

33:30.827 --> 33:32.617
- Stef!
- Foster!

33:32.639 --> 33:35.580
Stef! No!

33:38.768 --> 33:40.543
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

33:43.626 --> 33:45.426
Whoa! The teacher! The
teacher has the gun!

33:45.441 --> 33:47.194
It's the teacher!

33:47.208 --> 33:49.672
- On the ground!
- Okay, okay!

33:50.114 --> 33:52.489
- Sorry!
- Everybody else, stand up,

33:52.518 --> 33:54.344
put your hands behind your head!

33:55.858 --> 33:58.016
Bring a gun to school? What
the hell is wrong with you?

33:58.053 --> 34:00.089
You almost got yourself killed!

34:00.698 --> 34:02.821
Are you okay?

34:02.850 --> 34:04.726
Some idiot teacher
brought a gun to school.

34:04.755 --> 34:07.544
Okay. You guys are okay?

34:08.052 --> 34:10.362
- You're Foster, right?
- Yes.

34:10.362 --> 34:12.885
- Come with me.
- Okay.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.572
You're with them. It's
okay now, all right?

34:14.572 --> 34:15.942
All right, everybody, single file...

34:15.963 --> 34:18.253
keep your hands on
your head, out this way.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.284
Keep going!

34:28.411 --> 34:30.020
All the way out.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.272
You're gonna follow him all
the way to the yellow tape.

35:37.615 --> 35:41.008
It's okay.

36:42.289 --> 36:44.934
_

36:47.832 --> 36:51.672
_

36:57.279 --> 36:58.830
Hey, um,

36:59.533 --> 37:03.510
forget about Daria. She's an idiot.

37:04.242 --> 37:05.553
Thanks.

37:06.046 --> 37:08.633
And thanks for being so cool

37:08.908 --> 37:11.270
when I was kind of freaking out.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.672
So, listen.

37:32.759 --> 37:34.220
Yeah?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.780
Today has been kind of intense, you know?

37:36.900 --> 37:38.890
And we had a lot of fun.

37:39.628 --> 37:42.938
And then, you know, thank you so much

37:42.995 --> 37:45.162
for being so sweet about
dumb-ass Robby and all that.

37:45.199 --> 37:47.488
- But...
- But what?

37:48.234 --> 37:52.429
I just... I don't want you
to think that we're, like,

37:52.738 --> 37:55.341
starting something up again.

37:56.348 --> 37:59.725
Uh... Yeah, no. No, uh,
I... Yeah, no, I didn't.

38:00.313 --> 38:02.914
- Yeah, no.
- Okay. Good.

38:02.965 --> 38:04.486
Yeah. Yeah, good.

38:04.606 --> 38:06.863
Yeah.

38:11.007 --> 38:12.709
So we've swept the entire school.

38:12.829 --> 38:14.571
No sign of the Stratos kid anywhere.

38:14.629 --> 38:17.056
We've got an APB out for
him, but for now, anyway,

38:17.092 --> 38:18.997
everyone should go home.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.135
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

38:22.316 --> 38:24.120
Where the hell is he?

38:51.723 --> 38:53.564
Why don't... why don't
you guys just hang out

38:53.592 --> 38:55.078
for a second, okay?

38:55.198 --> 38:57.505
I'll do a sweep of the house.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.671
Just be extra careful
till we know where Nick is.

38:59.686 --> 39:00.613
All right?

40:00.942 --> 40:02.565
I'm sorry.

40:57.461 --> 40:59.293
Okay, it's clear, guys.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.881
Clear.
