WEBVTT

00:04.297 --> 00:06.959
Crais:
The invitation was
for all of you.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.040
The others are still in
the Transport Pod.

00:09.135 --> 00:11.171
Prudent, but unnecessary.

00:11.262 --> 00:14.425
Talyn, scan Officer Sun.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.887
( beeping )

00:18.978 --> 00:21.139
Unarmed, as I requested.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.814
And you are still armed.
How are we supposed
to trust you?

00:24.901 --> 00:30.487
Talyn, I am now engaging
privacy mode and full
manual overrides.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.448
I will relink with you
within the am.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.447
My mind and Talyn's...

00:37.538 --> 00:38.744
(grunts)

00:38.831 --> 00:40.367
...are no longerjoined.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.991
I am, therefore...

00:45.463 --> 00:47.169
defenseless.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.623
Rygel:
Pilot, has Talyn grown bigger
since last we saw him?

00:50.718 --> 00:55.132
His, uh, cannon...
sure looks bigger.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.134
He has indeed grown.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.557
Moya is pleased that's he's
healthy and happy.

00:59.644 --> 01:04.263
Huh. How happy can he be
under the control of that
madman, Crais?

01:04.357 --> 01:07.190
Quite happy, or so he claims.

01:07.276 --> 01:11.565
And he insists that Crais
hasn't mistreated him.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.396
Crichton:
Is that Talyn talking or Crais?

01:13.491 --> 01:17.404
Evidently Talyn. Crais has
removed the neural transponder.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.451
I called for a truce, Crichton.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.153
I'm a man of my word.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.706
Oh, yeah? When did that start?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.371
Ka D'Argo.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.248
Pa'u Zhaan.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.579
A Banik slave?

01:29.674 --> 01:32.837
A Banik, yes, but no
longer a slave.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.963
You were at Scorpius'
Gammak Base.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.635
A prisoner with Crichton.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.553
I'm flattered you remember me.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.051
My name is Stark.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.098
Shall we skip the
meet and greet?

01:42.186 --> 01:44.347
Why did you call us?

01:44.438 --> 01:50.775
Despite my best efforts, Talyn
is becoming more aggressive,
more destructive.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.273
You must help me disarm him.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.904
Disarm Talyn?

01:55.992 --> 02:00.281
Mmm, are mother and child still
catching up on old times?

02:00.371 --> 02:04.159
Yep. They're chattering away
like a pair of bleethiks.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.491
Yes, well what are the others
chattering about?

02:06.585 --> 02:09.247
Well, I don't know.
-They've been over
there forever.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.501
I can't believe Crais is that
good a conversationalist.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.628
Another vessel is
approaching fast.

02:23.269 --> 02:24.850
It's a Plokavian ship.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.802
Oh, is that good or bad?

02:26.897 --> 02:29.229
Bad... very bad.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.357
What's Talyn doing?

02:41.412 --> 02:44.154
Oh, that cannon's
definitely grown.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.237
Rygel:
Crichton!

02:45.333 --> 02:47.164
What the frell is going
on over there?

02:47.251 --> 02:50.084
There's another Plokavian ship
heading towards us.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.911
Great. Can Talyn go two-for-two?

02:52.006 --> 02:54.042
How soon can we Starburst?

02:54.133 --> 02:55.293
I'm just asking.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.340
Talyn stopped talking to Moya.

02:57.428 --> 02:59.419
Pilot, we're on our way back.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.257
Crank up the docking web,
open the barn door, and
pull us in A.S.A.P.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.637
Pilot:
Watch your trajectory!

03:05.728 --> 03:08.219
Talyn's going into Starburst.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.854
Crichton! You must hurry!

03:17.948 --> 03:21.236
A second Plokavian vessel
is closing in.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.071
We're rolling as fast
as we can.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.906
Not fast enough.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.377
(electrical buzzing )

03:38.969 --> 03:40.880
(grunting)

03:42.681 --> 03:44.217
Crichton?

03:44.308 --> 03:46.048
Crichton!

03:46.310 --> 03:47.891
Anybody?

03:48.938 --> 03:50.599
(electrical hissing )

03:55.236 --> 03:57.147
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:57.238 --> 04:00.571
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.320
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:03.411 --> 04:06.995
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:07.081 --> 04:07.831
Help me.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.121
Listen, please.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.290
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:11.377 --> 04:15.461
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:15.548 --> 04:17.914
I'm doing everything I can.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.841
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.944
( groans )

04:46.704 --> 04:48.114
How is everybody?

04:48.205 --> 04:51.038
D'Argo's still out, but he
doesn't seem to be hurt.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.703
Crichton:
Where's Aeryn?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.876
We don't know. She wasn't
here when we all awoke.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.373
Aeryn!

04:57.673 --> 04:59.288
Aeryn?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.257
Pilot. Sparky.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.209
No. The Comms aren't working.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.763
Whatever immobilized us in the
Transport Pod knocked out the
Comms as well.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.260
The Dampening Net.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.478
It's the only Plokavian weapon
that isn't lethal.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.348
Aeryn?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.522
Aeryn!

05:20.362 --> 05:23.320
Wow! How far down does that go?

05:23.407 --> 05:24.738
( hawking )

05:27.286 --> 05:29.368
( reverberating clunk)

05:31.707 --> 05:34.323
That's a long way down.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.875
Either that or they've got
deep shag carpet.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.793
You?! This is all your fault!

05:38.881 --> 05:40.291
Stop it!
-But he...

05:40.382 --> 05:42.634
Quiet. Cut it out.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.425
( D'Argo breathing heavily)

05:53.229 --> 05:56.266
Where the hezmana are we?

05:56.357 --> 05:58.268
Some kind of floating hubcap.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.270
Hoobkap?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.688
Where's Aeryn?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.270
Good question.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.196
Bad answer.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.905
l have told you, no one
is responsible.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.371
Gahv:
Someone is.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.912
You destroyed a Plokavian
vessel

06:13.999 --> 06:16.991
Fento:
You say Talyn is a living ship.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.826
ls Talyn responsible?

06:18.921 --> 06:22.755
There is no way that Talyn
could have fired that
cannon on his own.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.127
His manual overrides
were engaged.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.335
Then one of you must
have fired it.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.841
The one who fled on Talyn.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.797
Uh... Crais.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.223
Could he have done it?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.847
He was nowhere near the
weapon's console.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.179
We don't believe you.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.856
Are you protecting him?

06:40.943 --> 06:42.729
No.

06:42.820 --> 06:46.233
Look, if I wanted to lie it
would be easy to blame it
on Crais, wouldn't it?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.905
After all, he and Talyn fled,
did they not?

06:48.993 --> 06:52.360
If they hadn't, would it make a
difference to your story?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.489
No.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.196
You're lying.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.875
You don't want to see either
of them dispersed.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.168
Look, lam not lying.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.213
And I don't want to see
anyone dispersed.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.586
Not even the guilty party?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.213
There is no guilty party.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.135
I'm telling you, it must have
been an accident.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.929
Ridiculous!

07:13.017 --> 07:15.178
We should just execute
all of you.

07:15.269 --> 07:19.729
Then we could be sure that the
guilty party was punished.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.398
(water splashing gently)

07:24.945 --> 07:27.857
Do I offend your senses?

07:27.948 --> 07:28.858
No.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.736
You seem distressed.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.987
(hissing)

07:33.078 --> 07:34.158
Did you do it?

07:34.246 --> 07:37.283
You are protecting yourself,
aren't you?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.911
No. I'm telling you
what happened.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.369
Tell me again, without
the lies!

07:43.464 --> 07:47.503
Start from where the others
joined you on Talyn.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.299
(hissing)

07:50.387 --> 07:53.049
All right.

07:53.140 --> 07:58.430
D'Argo, Zhaan, and Stark
followed Crichton in.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.141
Pa'u Zhaan, join us.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.024
A Banik slave?

08:06.111 --> 08:09.103
Zhaan:
Banik, yes, but no
longer a slave.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.234
You were on Scorpius'
Gammak Base.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.280
A prisoner with Crichton.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.154
Flattered you remember me.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.825
My name is Stark.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.825
Crichton:
Shall we skip the
meet and greet?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.781
Why did you phone us?

08:20.876 --> 08:27.122
Despite my best efforts, Talyn
is becoming more aggressive,
more destructive.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.208
I need your help to disarm him.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.587
Disarm Talyn?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.920
Not entirely. We still need to
protect ourselves, of course.

08:34.014 --> 08:38.599
| merely wish to make his
armament non-lethal by trading
his main cannon

08:38.686 --> 08:42.679
for a Dampening Net which will
incapacitate hostile vessels.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.515
Where will you obtain a
Dampening Net?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.315
From a Plokavian arms dealer.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.314
The Plokavians? Are you serious?

08:49.405 --> 08:51.191
Who are the Plokavians?

08:51.281 --> 08:55.320
They're a race who build
powerful and dangerous weapons.

08:55.411 --> 08:59.825
Yes. However, what I want is
a simple Dampening Net.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.906
Peacekeeper lies!

09:02.000 --> 09:05.618
This has to be a trap to get
more dangerous weapons
aboard Talyn.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.078
Hear him out, D'Argo.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.628
Leave D'Argo alone.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.172
He has a point.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.296
lf Crais is right about this
Dampening Net being non-lethal

09:13.387 --> 09:14.968
then maybe it's a good thing
for Talyn.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.135
Exactly.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.930
We would need to supervise the
installation, of course.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.223
Certainly.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.971
| see a potential
difficulty here.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.099
What if Talyn doesn't want us
frelling with his weaponry?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.272
He will if I say it's okay.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.146
Crais:
I need your help, and Moya's,

09:30.237 --> 09:33.195
to convince Talyn to accept
the modifications.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.864
I will not be a party to this.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.111
Yeah, I have a problem.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.488
I mean, come here. What do we
know about these Plakavoids?

09:39.580 --> 09:42.322
It's Plokavians, John and how
much do we really need to know?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.997
It's a simple transaction.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.040
One that benefits Talyn.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.039
Well, I'm not sure I agree.

09:48.130 --> 09:51.167
I'm going to have to think
about this and perhaps even
meditate on the subject.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.543
D'Argo:
Enough thinking!

09:52.634 --> 09:55.421
If we really want to help Talyn,
then we should kill Crais!

09:55.512 --> 09:57.127
Crichton:
lam up for that.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.760
No! That doesn't help anything.
-|ndeed not.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.968
Talyn would become more
destructive without my guidance.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.848
You mean, your control!

10:05.939 --> 10:08.021
I can only control him
to a point.

10:08.108 --> 10:12.568
I can't even convince him to use
his weapons as a last resort.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.645
Aeryn:
Well, perhaps there I might
have more success.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.903
lam willing to link up with
Talyn for a direct
conversation.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.110
But Crais is the only one
that Talyn trusts.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.695
That is Talyn's mistake.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.496
How are we gonna trust
Crais again?

10:24.583 --> 10:27.746
Crais:
l have not misused
Talyn's power.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.451
I've only used it in
self-defense.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.253
Zhaan:
Well, maybe Crais
is right, John.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.502
We do know of Talyn's encounter
with the Halosians.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.458
Crais:
They attacked us.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.135
It was all that I could do to
stop Talyn from utterly
destroying them.

10:39.223 --> 10:42.181
Crichton:
Aeryn, what a stack of dren.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.178
D'Argo:
I still say we kill Crais.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.555
Well I don't know who
to believe.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.935
l have changed, Crichton.

10:50.025 --> 10:53.108
My only concern is for
Talyn's protection.

10:53.195 --> 10:57.655
Left unchecked, his
aggressiveness will
lead to disaster.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.356
( beeping )

10:59.451 --> 11:01.282
The Plokavian vessel's here.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.201
Plokavian:
Crais, we've arrived.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.403
Yes. You're ahead of schedule.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.409
Your ship is still active.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.207
Manual override is engaged,
as is privacy mode.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.501
Talyn is no longer monitoring
this conversation.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.125
As you wish.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.547
They are armed.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.420
Very well armed.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.422
Perhaps we'd better raise the
Defense Screen just in case.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.596
No. That may be interpreted
as a sign of bad faith.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.175
But with Talyn's defensives on
manual override, he can't
defend himself.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.010
Is there a problem, Crais?

11:28.105 --> 11:29.311
No problem.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.390
Let's discuss the terms
of our agreement.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.109
Who fired that shot?!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.235
Nobody and Proximity Sensors
were switched off.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.941
I must communicate with
Talyn and find out.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.651
Turn off the privacy mode,
we'll tell him ourselves.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.247
Aeryn, don't give him back
that transponder.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.161
l have another!

11:47.249 --> 11:48.489
You frelled us!

11:49.626 --> 11:50.911
Stark:
What's happening?

11:51.003 --> 11:51.992
Aeryn:
He's taking over Talyn again.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.623
Leave my ship now!

11:53.714 --> 11:55.545
You have to stay and explain
this to the Plokavian
authorities!

11:55.632 --> 11:57.338
No, Aeryn! We have to go now!
Come on!
-I can't let you do this!

11:57.426 --> 11:58.791
Go!

11:58.886 --> 12:00.877
I would have tried to remove
Crais's Transponder and

12:00.971 --> 12:03.804
forced him to stay, but the
others wouldn't risk it.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.223
So, we all left in the
Transport Pod

12:06.310 --> 12:09.302
and watched Talyn Starburst
away under Crais' control.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.763
So, the cannon just went
off my itself.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.814
No one had anything
to do with it.

12:14.902 --> 12:19.987
You understand we might find
that difficult to accept.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.813
It's the truth.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.413
That little dren!

12:30.500 --> 12:31.831
( Rygel muttering )

12:31.919 --> 12:33.875
( sniffing )

12:33.962 --> 12:36.123
Why aren't you on the Command?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.466
There's no food on the Command.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.508
You are supposed to be
negotiating with the Plokavians!

12:41.595 --> 12:43.335
We've got to get the
others back.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.636
They won't negotiate.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.759
Ha, they won't even respond.

12:46.850 --> 12:50.468
So, unless you have
any bright ideas...

12:50.562 --> 12:52.598
(metal groaning)

12:52.689 --> 12:53.599
Pilot?

12:53.690 --> 12:54.600
Oh!

12:54.691 --> 12:56.647
Feels like we're moving.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.268
Pilot, are we moving?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.352
Yes.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.860
Moya's looking for Talyn.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.237
Huh! Talyn Starburst away.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.070
Moya hasn't got a skizzik's
chance of finding him.

13:09.164 --> 13:13.123
She may not, but she
wishes to try anyway.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.746
Well, what about Crichton
and the others?

13:14.836 --> 13:18.124
Our absence will not change
their situation.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.752
However, if Moya locates Talyn,

13:20.842 --> 13:25.586
she might persuade him to
return with us and
help free them.

13:25.681 --> 13:26.841
Might?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.473
Well, there's, uh...

13:33.563 --> 13:36.600
there's nothing to hold onto.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.024
Where would we go anyway?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.726
(sighs)

13:40.821 --> 13:43.187
Sooner or later, one of us
is going to have to find
a bathroom.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.567
(laughing)

13:47.244 --> 13:49.451
I really wish you hadn't
said that.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.369
(hydraulic clank)
-What's that?

13:53.417 --> 13:54.202
Zhaan:
Aeryn.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.283
Crichton:
Aeryn. You okay?

13:56.378 --> 13:59.085
(clanging)

13:59.172 --> 14:00.207
Where have you been?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.799
Being questioned by
the Plokavians.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.714
They want to know what happened
aboard Talyn.

14:03.802 --> 14:07.590
We'll all be questioned. Don't
lie to them. Lying will get
us all executed.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.967
What did you tell them?
-The truth.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.602
(sighing)

14:19.109 --> 14:21.316
Oh God, I missed you so much.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.314
God! l was so worried
about you!

14:23.405 --> 14:24.110
Play along.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.573
Gahv:
Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.239
I missed you, too, John.
Hold me.

14:29.202 --> 14:29.861
Are they listening?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.454
l have to assume so.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.450
I told them no one was
responsible for firing
Talyn's weapons,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.156
that he must have
malfunctioned.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.411
That's not much of a story.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.003
Only one I had.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.294
( door slams )
We got to let the others know.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.121
Zhaan:
John!

14:43.216 --> 14:45.081
But, but...

14:49.389 --> 14:50.799
Frell.

14:52.976 --> 14:57.640
Ah, ah, that's one reason
Crais called for us.

14:57.731 --> 15:02.100
Ah, Talyn had been experiencing
some ah, problems with
his circuitry.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.230
Gahv:
Please resume your testimony.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.233
You are about to enter
Talyn's bridge.

15:07.324 --> 15:14.162
Ah, yes. Ah, Crichton went
first and... and um...

15:14.247 --> 15:16.112
Crais:
You were on Scorpius'
Gammak Base.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.744
A prisoner with Crichton.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.574
I'm flattered you remember me.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.330
My name is Stark.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.164
Crichton:
Can we skip the meet and greet?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.964
Why did you call us?

15:27.052 --> 15:30.544
Crais:
Despite my best efforts,
Talyn's becoming

15:30.639 --> 15:32.755
more aggressive,
more destructive.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.134
You must help me disarm him.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.762
Aeryn:
Disarm Talyn?

15:35.852 --> 15:38.104
Crais:
Not entirely. We still need to
defend ourselves, of course.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.520
| merely wish to make his
armament non-lethal

15:40.607 --> 15:42.893
by trading his main cannon
for a Dampening Net

15:42.984 --> 15:45.396
which will incapacitate
hostile vessels.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.149
Where will you obtain a
Dampening Net?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.730
From a Plokavian arms dealer.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.110
Plokavians?!

15:51.201 --> 15:53.237
Oh, I've heard of them. Quite
far advanced technologically.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.193
Strong believers in
truth and justice.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.746
D'Argo:
So you wish to trade Talyn's
main cannon with these Plokavians

15:58.834 --> 16:00.199
in exchange for a
Dampening Net?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.033
Crais:
Precisely.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.087
Given that Talyn's circuitry
has been prone to malfunction
lately,

16:05.173 --> 16:08.210
equipping him with a non-lethal
weapon would seem to me

16:08.301 --> 16:09.586
to be in everyone's
best interests.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.509
Except I don't trust you.

16:11.596 --> 16:15.180
John, it pains me to realize
you still haven't forgiven me
for my past misdeeds.

16:15.267 --> 16:19.135
However, you can supervise the
installation yourself.

16:19.229 --> 16:23.188
You'll need our help and Moya's
if you want to sedate Talyn for
the modifications.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.890
Oh, wow. That, I...

16:24.985 --> 16:26.316
I hadn't thought about that.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.735
Talyn might not want to give up
his cannon, right?

16:28.822 --> 16:32.531
Talyn was designed by
Peacekeepers. Peacekeepers
never give up their weapons.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.118
Good point.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.114
Aeryn:
But it's in his best interest,
so we should let Crais do it.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.490
Yeah, I guess we should.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.447
Sounds very reasonable to me.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.248
Mmm.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.919
Fento:
You're saying that nobody had
a problem with Crais' plan?

16:46.006 --> 16:50.170
Oh, no, of course
they did, um...

16:50.260 --> 16:53.423
And that's when D'Argo
lost his temper.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.630
Gahv:
And why did he do that?

16:56.725 --> 17:02.140
Well, he's a Luxan, and Luxans
are subject to fits of
hyper-rage.

17:02.230 --> 17:06.189
Well... and he lost his son,
you know.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.813
That made him edgy.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.690
What are you talking
about, John?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.645
I will not be a party to this!

17:12.741 --> 17:14.026
Why not, D'Argo?

17:14.117 --> 17:16.108
What if he's lying?
What if this is just a trick

17:16.203 --> 17:18.660
to get even worse weapons
aboard Talyn?

17:18.747 --> 17:21.238
Oh, yeah, th-that's a good
point. D'Argo makes
a good point...

17:21.333 --> 17:23.244
D'Argo is thinking with his
mivonks again.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.122
A Plokavian Dampening Net
is just what Talyn needs.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.920
If this is a trick, Crais,
l'll break your neck.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.749
No trick. I just want to
help Talyn.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.629
He doesn't need your help.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.221
He most certainly does.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.138
Talyn would be even more
destructive without my guidance.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.510
Don't you mean your control?

17:39.601 --> 17:41.216
| only control him to a point.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.599
Believe me, it's been hard to
convince Talyn that the
use of his weapons

17:44.689 --> 17:46.190
should only be as a
last resort.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.311
Let me communicate with him.
I'll teach him to behave.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.518
Officer Sun, Talyn trusts me.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.194
I sure don't.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.522
John, l have not misused
Talyn's power.

17:55.617 --> 17:59.610
I've only fired his cannons
in self-defense.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.444
Zhaan:
Yes, he may be speaking
the truth.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.282
Consider his encounter with the
Halosians. He could've
destroyed them, but he didn't.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.287
Crais:
Correct.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.289
They attacked us, but I
showed restraint.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.336
Now doesn't that demonstrate
my good intentions?

18:10.423 --> 18:11.708
( beeping )

18:11.800 --> 18:13.415
The Plokavian's vessel is here.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.252
Aeryn:
Let's finalize arrangements.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.836
Plokavian:
Crais, we're here.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.091
Crais:
Right on schedule.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.513
Your ship is still active.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.807
Manual override...
-Beautiful ship, isn't it?

18:22.894 --> 18:24.134
Mmm.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.185
Quite aesthetically pleasing.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.390
Weapons Console malfunction.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.523
Aeryn:
No, no, stay away!

18:34.614 --> 18:35.524
Crichton:
We have to disarm it.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.946
Aeryn:
You might set it off.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.828
The Plokavians will have great
difficulty believing there
was an accident.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.419
We'd better go!

18:48.503 --> 18:51.040
No. If the authorities arrive,
you and Talyn should be
here to explain.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.712
I can't take that chance.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.300
Leave now, or I'll force you!

18:54.384 --> 18:56.215
He has another transponder.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.678
Now, go!

19:00.765 --> 19:04.474
Zhaan:
There was nothing we
could do, so...

19:04.561 --> 19:07.678
we boarded the Transport Pod
to return to Moya...

19:07.772 --> 19:10.104
and, um...

19:10.191 --> 19:12.728
and that's when you
captured us.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.362
Any more questions?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.204
( low growl )

19:32.714 --> 19:36.206
This is the weirdest hoosegow
I've ever been in.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.213
Slammer, clink, jail, prison.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.135
Just how many of them
have you been in?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.258
Just what are you implying?

19:46.102 --> 19:48.639
Zhaan,
How'd it go?

19:49.939 --> 19:53.181
I told them what I saw.
I hope they believe me.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.267
If they don't, we all die.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.272
I know that.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.649
12W '9335

19:58.740 --> 20:00.571
Just see that you remember it.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.274
D'Argo. Chill out, bro.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.492
( growls )

20:08.583 --> 20:10.198
( cage closes )

20:19.511 --> 20:23.129
He said he only wanted a
Dampening Net, but I
didn't believe him.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.134
Gahv:
Why not?

20:25.225 --> 20:28.092
He's, uh... an
ex-Peacekeeper captain

20:28.186 --> 20:32.054
who abandoned his own people
and abducted Talyn.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.434
He's completely power-mad.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.438
The reformed Crais is
just an act.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.861
Crichton wasn't buying it,
either.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.239
You expect us to help you.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.246
You must help me.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.117
Talyn is refusing to permit
any modifications.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.789
Aeryn:
Good for Talyn.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.039
Evidently, your control over him
isn't as absolute as you
thought.

20:55.130 --> 20:59.920
D'Argo:
John, give me the word and
I'll break his neck.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.343
You don't dare.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.093
Talyn will be lost without
my guidance.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.095
He needs a captain.
He chose me.

21:10.186 --> 21:14.304
Well, perhaps we should
override that choice.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.394
l have not misused Talyn's
power.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.942
I've only fired his cannons
in self-defense.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.361
As you did with the Halosians.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.400
They attacked us.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.995
| spared their lives.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.785
I'm not a killer.

21:32.292 --> 21:36.160
I don't care what you say.
We're not going to help you.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.505
You'll regret this.
I assure you.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.129
( beeping )

21:43.219 --> 21:44.299
The Plokavians are here.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.003
Plokavian:
Crais, your ship is
still active.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.713
Never mind.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.309
Our deal is cancelled.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.224
I cannot permit that.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.893
The contract stands.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.395
Gahv:
That's not what the
others told us.

21:59.486 --> 22:03.274
You want us to believe they're
protecting Crais?!

22:03.364 --> 22:05.696
No.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.819
They're protecting Talyn.

22:07.911 --> 22:11.995
They know you'd have to destroy
Talyn to bring Crais
to justice.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.663
Fento:
And you don't care about Talyn?

22:14.751 --> 22:17.914
Not as much as I care
about the others.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.212
Besides, you may never
catch them.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.629
( Rygel sighs deeply)

22:28.723 --> 22:30.634
Any sign of Talyn?

22:30.725 --> 22:31.931
None.

22:32.018 --> 22:36.307
Moya is completely wasting
her time.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.888
Pilot, we really should head
back now.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.939
Moya wants to keep looking.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.190
She's not looking; she's flying
around in circles!

22:44.280 --> 22:48.865
We are following a spiral search
pattern of my own devising,

22:48.952 --> 22:51.113
which maximizes the
possibility that we...

22:51.204 --> 22:54.537
That we completely lose our
bearings and never find our way
back to the others!

22:54.624 --> 22:59.288
I'm doing as Moya wishes.
Do not question us!

22:59.379 --> 23:02.246
( Rygel snickers)
Well done, Chiana.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.207
You could have a fine career
as a diplomat.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.168
Frell you, Rygel.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.221
Given your excellent way
with words.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.593
(laughing)

23:18.231 --> 23:20.688
( D'Argo huffing )

23:22.652 --> 23:25.735
Watch your step.
It's a long way down.

23:25.822 --> 23:29.360
Keep bothering me and I'll test
that theory by throwing
you over it.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.032
Just trying to cheer you up.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.327
Don't bother.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.870
Fento:
Prisoners, your testimonies
do not correspond.

23:39.961 --> 23:44.204
Unless we hear the truth,
you will all be executed!

23:45.341 --> 23:46.421
What did you say to them?

23:46.509 --> 23:47.874
Leave me alone.
-Tell me!

23:47.969 --> 23:49.550
Stark:
I said get away from me!

23:51.931 --> 23:54.638
My mask! Give me my mask!

23:54.726 --> 23:55.886
What's happening to him?

23:55.977 --> 23:58.969
Help me! My mask!

23:59.063 --> 24:00.314
Help me!

24:01.899 --> 24:03.435
My mask!

24:04.193 --> 24:05.569
Help me!

24:07.196 --> 24:08.151
Help me!

24:08.239 --> 24:09.445
Shh!

24:14.287 --> 24:17.154
What the hell was that?

24:17.248 --> 24:21.958
My mask keeps my energies
in check. I...

24:22.045 --> 24:24.161
I wasn't prepared to
lose it. I...

24:24.255 --> 24:26.712
I lost control.
I wasn't focused.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.300
D'Argo, that didn't help.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.840
Oh, and Stark's lies will?

24:29.927 --> 24:32.339
Gahv:
Ka D'Argo!

24:35.391 --> 24:37.473
I'll tell them what I
really saw.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.307
Plokavians?

24:41.397 --> 24:42.386
Are you farh bot?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.814
And who are the Plokavians?

24:44.901 --> 24:47.187
Barbarians. Murderers.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.269
Builders of horrific weapons.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.195
Uh, shatter grenades.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.523
Novatrin gas.
Seismic disruptors.

24:53.618 --> 24:56.985
They're frelling savages
who deal in death.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.160
Gahv:
Savages!

24:58.247 --> 25:00.863
That was the word he used.

25:00.958 --> 25:05.122
Then Aeryn decided to step in
and defend Crais.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.295
Crais only wants a
Dampening Net.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.963
D'Argo:
Dren!

25:12.261 --> 25:13.717
You know what I think?

25:13.805 --> 25:15.341
I think you are right.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.012
Crais:
Not at all.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.307
You can supervise the
installation yourself.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.726
No, we must leave now!

25:21.813 --> 25:23.394
You can't leave.

25:23.481 --> 25:28.271
I need your help and Moya's to
sedate Talyn for the
modifications.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.942
We will not be a party to this.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.644
Stark:
We must stop the Plokavians.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.024
They're evil.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.654
Their weapons have helped
enslave many worlds,

25:36.744 --> 25:38.780
including mine.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.284
Crais:
But this weapon will
help Talyn.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.333
I think I know how to
help Talyn.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.207
Why don't we break Crais' neck?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.162
I am down with that.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.122
(sighs)

25:51.217 --> 25:53.128
Violence will not solve
the problem.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.926
Crais:
Indeed not. Killing me
would harm Talyn.

25:56.013 --> 26:00.052
He would be even more
destructive without my guidance.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.008
You mean, your control?

26:02.103 --> 26:03.809
I only control him to a point.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.978
I could help with that,
if you'd let me.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.441
He won't.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.938
He wants to keep Talyn's powers
for his own selfish purposes.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.313
Yeah.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.612
l have not misused
Talyn's power.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.532
I've only fired in
self-defense.

26:17.618 --> 26:18.994
He may be right.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.114
We do know of Talyn's encounter
with the Halosians.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.161
He stopped Talyn from
destroying them.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.205
(electronic beeping )

26:25.293 --> 26:26.328
The Plokavians are here.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.535
Oh, tell them you've changed
your mind.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.130
Don't deal with them.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.750
Plokavian :
Crais, we've arrived.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.921
Ahead of schedule.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.874
Your vessel has not
been sedated.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.129
Crais:
Privacy mode is engaged.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.051
Talyn can't hear this
conversation.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.299
D'Argo:
It's well-armed.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.052
Look at the cargo analysis.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.516
Novatrin gas.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.560
Eats you alive, from the
inside out.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.263
We can't let Crais get near
these monsters.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.610
We have to strike first.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.150
D'Argo:
Stop!

26:57.158 --> 26:58.318
(shrieks)

26:58.409 --> 26:59.865
What have you done?

26:59.952 --> 27:00.941
Give it up, Crais.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.197
Stark frelled you, Crais.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.119
Yeah, you're not getting
this back either.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.323
He's got another transponder.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.202
(gaSDS)

27:07.293 --> 27:08.123
What's happened?

27:08.211 --> 27:09.371
He's back in control of Talyn.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.999
Did you think that I'd give her
my only transponder?

27:12.089 --> 27:14.546
Now, get off my ship!

27:14.634 --> 27:16.374
Gahv:
Stark fired the cannon.

27:16.469 --> 27:21.429
Yes, but I will never mourn the
death of someone who deals
in Novatrin gas.

27:21.516 --> 27:23.381
Then why turn Stark in?

27:23.476 --> 27:28.561
Because the rest of us should
not be responsible for
something that he alone did.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.184
(snons)

27:36.364 --> 27:39.948
D'Argo's testimony's going
to get me executed.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.240
I'm sure of it.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.322
But you didn't fire the cannon.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.327
I know I didn't.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.997
You have to believe me.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.828
I didn't do it.

28:06.978 --> 28:08.593
Hey!

28:10.273 --> 28:12.559
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

28:13.776 --> 28:17.610
It'sjust, it's... it's been
over three arns.

28:17.697 --> 28:21.440
Just between you and me,
wh-what are our chances of
finding Talyn?

28:21.534 --> 28:23.115
Minuscule.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.113
So, what are we doing?

28:25.204 --> 28:29.698
Moya feels guilty.

28:29.792 --> 28:33.330
Why? Because... because Talyn
blew up some weapons dealer?

28:33.421 --> 28:36.834
Well if you ask me, they
had it coming.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.301
Talyn's her son, Chiana.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.092
She feels responsible for
what he does.

28:42.179 --> 28:47.094
Yeah, but doesn't she also feel
responsible for D'Argo,
Crichton... Zhaan?

28:48.311 --> 28:49.266
Aeryn?

28:50.855 --> 28:52.265
Don't you?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.810
You're the Pilot.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.857
Aren't you?

28:56.944 --> 29:00.277
I will not force her to
abandon the search.

29:00.364 --> 29:03.231
But I will ask her.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.817
But what if they manage to
escape in the Transport Pod,
and...

29:05.912 --> 29:07.243
and we're not there
to get them?

29:07.330 --> 29:11.323
Moya understands your concern,

29:11.417 --> 29:13.248
(sighs)

29:13.336 --> 29:15.418
and she agrees with it.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.119
She does?

29:17.214 --> 29:20.377
I'm setting a return
course now.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.942
Gahv:
John Crichton!

29:44.283 --> 29:45.739
( door slams )

30:04.387 --> 30:06.924
Fento:
Who fired the cannon?

30:07.014 --> 30:08.800
Nobody did.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.382
Must have been a malfunction.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.223
D'Argo:
Stark was at the
Weapons Console.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.850
He was frantic.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.399
Before I could stop him,
he fired the cannon.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.561
D'Argo said that?

30:23.656 --> 30:26.363
Fento:
Was he lying?

30:27.076 --> 30:28.737
He...

30:29.537 --> 30:32.745
was confused.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.743
Stark's never even been
aboard Talyn.

30:34.834 --> 30:37.166
He probably wouldn't know how
to find the Weapons Console.

30:37.253 --> 30:40.086
Aeryn:
Stark offered to raise Talyn's
Defense Screen.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.708
He started towards the
Weapons Console,

30:41.799 --> 30:44.916
but I stopped him before he
could touch anything.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.461
Well that makes sense.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.673
D'Argo sees Stark near the
Weapons Console so after
the big bang,

30:51.767 --> 30:55.601
he assumes it's Stark because
Stark was the closest.

30:57.398 --> 31:00.936
Zhaan:
Well, no one ever approached
the Weapons Console.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.109
When it malfunctioned,

31:03.195 --> 31:07.438
Crichton started toward it but
Aeryn told him not to touch it.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.991
Fento:
Then you were the closest.

31:11.078 --> 31:13.569
Look, you guys have gotta
understand something.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.459
Everybody's stories are gonna
be a little different.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.410
Nobody sees things the
exact same way.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.165
Fento:
We do!

31:22.256 --> 31:24.372
What, ten Plokavoids see
a fender bender.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.298
Do you get ten
identical reports?

31:28.262 --> 31:31.345
Well, the rest of the universe
doesn't work that way.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.218
There's going to be some
inconsistencies.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.473
Fento:
Such as this one?

31:37.563 --> 31:42.057
Stark:
Then Crais got angry and
marched over to the Weapons Console

31:42.151 --> 31:44.107
and pressed a control.

31:44.195 --> 31:48.234
That's when the...
the cannon fired.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.157
Stark hates Peacekeepers.

31:52.244 --> 31:56.157
He'd like to see you go after
Crais, even if Crais didn't
destroy your ship.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.079
'/’l’:)«:<‘((

31:58.167 --> 31:59.577
We have heard enough!

31:59.668 --> 32:02.159
You're all lying!

32:02.254 --> 32:05.997
Further testimony is a
waste of time!

32:08.928 --> 32:13.297
The executions will
begin immediately!

32:17.228 --> 32:24.600
Look, tell us who the guilty
one is and we'll spare
the others.

32:24.693 --> 32:30.279
Otherwise, we will commence
the executions with you.

32:30.366 --> 32:34.200
There's just nothing new in
the universe, is there?

32:34.286 --> 32:38.120
It's the same everywhere.
Good cop, bad cop.

32:38.207 --> 32:41.040
You think we're bluffing?

32:41.127 --> 32:44.335
Nope. I don't think you give
a damn about the truth.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.252
I think you're looking
for a scapegoat.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.706
We want justice.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.549
All right, then, listen up.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.132
Yes...

32:54.223 --> 32:57.090
we are lying.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.300
You say we're going to be
executed at dawn.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.102
Is it some big surprise that we
cover for one another?

33:02.189 --> 33:04.976
No, but it must stop.

33:05.067 --> 33:09.936
Okay. It stops here.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.770
I'll give it to you straight.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.948
I don't know what happened.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.320
Probably never will.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.822
Could have been Stark,
could have been Crais,

33:17.913 --> 33:20.245
could have been any one of us.

33:22.418 --> 33:25.000
The best I can do is tell
you what I saw.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.204
No coverings, no editorials,
no axes to grind.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.335
Does that work for you?

33:30.426 --> 33:31.632
Go on.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.425
All right.

33:36.015 --> 33:41.476
We're good, right up to the
point where Crais tells us
about the Plakavoids.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.312
The Plakavoids, are you farbot?

33:45.399 --> 33:46.684
Who are the Plakavoids?

33:46.775 --> 33:49.232
A dangerous race who build
horrific weapons.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.153
Shatter grenades that turn
bones to powder.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.823
Seismic Disrupters that can
destroy entire planets.

33:55.910 --> 33:59.243
And Novatrin gas, which
eats your body alive.

33:59.330 --> 34:03.198
What's your point?
All I want is a Dampening Net.

34:03.292 --> 34:06.580
Well, suppose what you
really want

34:06.670 --> 34:10.709
is to install even deadlier
weapons on Talyn?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.881
( chuckles )

34:12.968 --> 34:15.050
You can supervise the
installation yourself.

34:15.137 --> 34:19.050
In fact, I'll need your help
and Moya's to sedate Talyn
for the modification.

34:19.141 --> 34:22.133
He won't part with his
cannon willingly.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.093
Crichton:
Interesting.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.304
Can you blame him for that?

34:26.398 --> 34:30.107
No, we cannot be a
party to this.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.730
We can't have anything
to do with this.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.482
The Plakavoids are
an evil race.

34:34.573 --> 34:39.158
Their weapons have helped
enslave many worlds,
including my own.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.657
This weapon will help Talyn.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.533
D'Argo:
I know a way we can help Talyn.

34:43.624 --> 34:47.287
Why don't we just
break your neck?

34:47.378 --> 34:48.663
( chuckles )

34:48.754 --> 34:51.166
That would exacerbate
the problem.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.215
Talyn would be even more
destructive without my guidance.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.041
You mean your control?

34:56.136 --> 34:58.127
I only control him to a point.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.964
And I can't seem to convince
him that the use of his weapons

35:01.058 --> 35:03.515
should only be as a last resort.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.345
Perhaps another captain would
have more success.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.473
Doubtful, he trusts me.

35:12.236 --> 35:15.319
Then he's the only one
around here who does.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.697
l have not misused
Talyn's power.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.321
I've only fired his cannons
in self-defense.

35:21.412 --> 35:24.449
John, we do know of Talyn's
encounter with the Halosians.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.326
Crais:
Correct, they attacked us.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.749
It was all I could do to stop
Talyn from finishing them off.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.747
Yeah, right.

35:30.838 --> 35:34.330
I have changed, Crichton.

35:34.425 --> 35:37.542
My only concern is for
Talyn's protection.

35:37.636 --> 35:42.221
Left unchecked, his
aggressiveness will lead
to disaster.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.173
The solution I propose...

35:44.268 --> 35:45.599
(electronic beeping )

35:45.686 --> 35:46.892
The Plakavoidian vessel's here.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.095
This is wrong.
We shouldn't deal with them.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.726
( beeping continues)

35:51.817 --> 35:54.650
Crais, assuming we want
to neuter Talyn,

35:54.737 --> 35:57.820
are these really the people we
want to be in business with?

35:57.906 --> 36:01.239
Do you know anyone else who can
provide Talyn what he needs?

36:01.327 --> 36:03.818
Plakavoid:
Crais, we've arrived.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.118
Crais:
Yes, you're ahead of schedule.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.582
Your ship is still active.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.906
Crais:
Privacy mode is engaged.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.662
Talyn can't hear this
conversation.

36:10.753 --> 36:11.993
Crichton:
Stark, what are you doing?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.588
We have to strike first.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.789
(grunts and gasps)

36:17.551 --> 36:19.212
What have you done?

36:29.688 --> 36:32.179
And then Crais forced us
off the ship.

36:32.274 --> 36:39.237
You assert that Stark did
touch something at the
Weapons Console?

36:39.323 --> 36:43.191
After I shut down the console.

36:43.285 --> 36:47.244
With the safety on, Stark
couldn't do a thing.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.538
He did not fire the cannon.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.995
Nobody did.

36:53.087 --> 36:55.373
And that's how I saw it.

36:55.464 --> 36:59.628
Cross my heart, hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.175
There's nothing Crichton
can do.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.594
I'm going to be executed.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.931
Wonder how they'll do it.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.259
Pulse fire? Strangulation?

37:10.354 --> 37:11.434
(sighs)

37:11.522 --> 37:13.228
Maybe even Novatrin gas.

37:13.315 --> 37:16.398
They mentioned something
called dispersal.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.861
What else did they say?

37:20.948 --> 37:23.189
I didn't ask for details.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.154
Why?

37:26.245 --> 37:30.329
Because there's a remote chance
that I could survive dispersal.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.123
My physical form is only
part of my reality.

37:33.210 --> 37:36.293
Much of me is energy that
I can control and project.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.463
The energy his mask holds in.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.461
Maybe if I'm prepared for it,

37:41.552 --> 37:44.965
I can transfer enough of myself
into another realm to survive.

37:45.055 --> 37:50.220
Well, we do know that creatures
like Maldis can be dispersed
and and re-coalesce.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.518
Maybe I can return to this
realm some day.

37:57.901 --> 38:02.235
No. No, I don't believe
it either.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.529
But even a remote
possibility is...

38:04.616 --> 38:06.902
(machinery creaking )

38:13.292 --> 38:14.452
( latch opening )

38:14.543 --> 38:17.455
Prisoners!

38:17.546 --> 38:23.837
We have considered your
testimonies and reached
a conclusion.

38:26.430 --> 38:33.302
Your lack of candor gives us
no choice but to have you
all put to death.

38:33.395 --> 38:36.102
Aeryn: Oh, I don't believe this!
Crichton: Hey, I was straight
with you!

38:36.190 --> 38:39.102
Start with the Peacekeeper!

38:41.987 --> 38:43.227
Wait!

38:43.322 --> 38:46.405
I cannot let the others die
on my behalf.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.902
I have to tell the truth.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.450
I fired on the Plokavian ship
and destroyed it.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.152
Stark, don't!

38:52.247 --> 38:53.953
(groans and gasps)

38:58.128 --> 39:01.416
You freely confess your crime?

39:02.090 --> 39:03.375
Yes, I do.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.669
Stark:
Does that surprise you?

39:05.761 --> 39:07.501
Fento:
Not in the least.

39:07.596 --> 39:12.465
Gahv:
You were our prime suspect
from the start.

39:43.257 --> 39:44.918
(steel door slamming)

39:46.843 --> 39:52.008
I thank you all for the great
risks you took to save a mere
Banik slave.

39:52.641 --> 39:55.724
Your acceptance...

39:58.397 --> 40:00.888
yourfriendship...

40:00.983 --> 40:02.939
has meant a lot to me.

40:03.026 --> 40:08.191
You have confessed to
the crime of murder.

40:08.282 --> 40:12.150
Are you ready to accept
the penalty?

40:12.244 --> 40:13.609
Ready.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.498
( screaming )

40:21.211 --> 40:24.328
(scream echoing )

40:31.221 --> 40:33.758
The Plokavian ship has departed,

40:33.849 --> 40:37.262
And Moya's ready to Starburst
once you're back aboard.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.217
Thank you, Pilot.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.479
I misjudged Stark.

40:42.566 --> 40:46.104
I thought he was trying to save
himself, but he was really
trying to save us all.

40:48.572 --> 40:51.939
He shouldn't have died
for his crime.

40:52.034 --> 40:53.194
What crime?

40:53.285 --> 40:55.276
Stark committed no crime.

40:56.330 --> 40:59.242
I saw him fire the cannon.

41:00.334 --> 41:01.699
So did I.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.660
Crichton:
You saw him press the
fire button.

41:04.755 --> 41:08.122
I had shut down the Weapons
Console so he couldn't fire.

41:08.216 --> 41:11.834
Did you know what else would
happen when you neutralized
the controls?

41:15.015 --> 41:17.552
I knew that shutting down
the Weapons Console

41:17.643 --> 41:20.055
would kill the manual
override, yeah.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.260
Hmm.

41:21.355 --> 41:23.846
You returned control of the
weapons to Talyn.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.646
Why would Talyn fire?

41:25.734 --> 41:30.854
When Talyn scanned the arms
dealers' cargo, he asked Moya
what it was.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.529
She realized it was
Novatrin gas,

41:33.617 --> 41:37.826
one of the six forbidden
cargoes no Leviathan may carry.

41:37.913 --> 41:39.619
Moya clued him in.

41:39.706 --> 41:43.324
And Talyn destroyed that ship.

41:43.418 --> 41:47.536
He thought he was
protecting Moya.

42:25.127 --> 42:26.992
You'll find him.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.873
I know I will.

42:31.091 --> 42:35.084
But only because Stark came
back to tell me where he was.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.762
Why did he do that?

42:40.308 --> 42:42.219
Well, he...

42:42.310 --> 42:44.392
he felt he owed you and
Crichton a debt.

42:46.273 --> 42:49.731
Maybe this was his way
of repaying it.

42:52.320 --> 42:57.155
I've become so distrustful
of people,

42:57.242 --> 43:00.325
even when they're trying
to help me.

43:01.413 --> 43:05.247
What does that say about
what I've become?

43:05.333 --> 43:07.119
Crichton:
Can I ask you a question?

43:07.210 --> 43:08.711
Mm-hmm.

43:08.795 --> 43:12.037
When the Plokavians were
questioning you,

43:12.132 --> 43:14.214
why didn't you try to
finger Crais?

43:15.385 --> 43:17.626
What if they believed me?

43:17.721 --> 43:19.507
They probably would have
gone after Crais

43:19.598 --> 43:22.340
and they would have had to kill
Talyn to get to him.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.599
So, you were protecting Talyn?

43:25.687 --> 43:27.393
Of course.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.568
And that's it?

43:35.655 --> 43:37.395
Yes.

43:42.996 --> 43:44.782
Can I ask you something?

43:46.208 --> 43:47.197
Mm-hmm.

43:50.253 --> 43:53.211
Do you think it's possible...

43:53.298 --> 43:55.539
that Stark survived?

44:02.015 --> 44:05.348
Since I got here, I've seen a
lot of impossible things.

44:09.898 --> 44:13.390
Well, Zhaan thinks
it's possible.

44:15.278 --> 44:18.111
Yeah, she says she does.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.940
But I don't think she
believes it.
