00:27.945 --> 00:29.105
I have a good teacher.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.032
What is it?
What brings you home so early?

00:36.120 --> 00:40.284
Milah, my weaving days are behind us.
I've been called to the front.

00:48.883 --> 00:53.217
No, Rumple, I've heard stories.
The front, it's a brutal place.

00:53.763 --> 00:58.598
Oh, Milah, I know, I know.
I can't say that I won't be frightened.

00:59.936 --> 01:02.143
But this is the chance
I've been waiting for.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.806
All my life.

01:04.649 --> 01:09.268
You know, I've lived under the shadow
of my father's actions for too long now.

01:10.154 --> 01:13.817
Just because your father was a coward,
it doesn't mean you are.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.657
Oh, I know that. As do you.

01:17.328 --> 01:18.693
But to the world?

01:19.163 --> 01:23.281
Fighting in this war finally gives me the
chance to prove that to everyone else.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.832
Go. Be brave.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.336
Fight honorably.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.175
(WHISPERS) I love you, too.

01:35.805 --> 01:39.844
And when you return, we can start
living the life we've always dreamed of.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.014
Yeah.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.933

CORA: What is it, sweetie?

02:30.693 --> 02:35.687
lt's Henry. Emma left town with
Gold and she took him with her.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.988
And you didn't stop them?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.533
I didn't know until after they'd gone.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.988
I'm sure he's safe.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.242
And as soon as Gold's done,
Henry will be back.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.827
(WHISPERS) But not with me.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.001
Back from where?
Where has Rumplestiltskin gone?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.332
I don't know.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.590
Well, if he's left town then
he's powerless. He can be killed.

02:55.718 --> 03:00.337
The moment either of us leave,
we lose our magic. And our advantage.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.511
And your memories?

03:01.766 --> 03:03.256
None of us were victims of the curse.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.223
It's not about memories.
It's about magic.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.597
Well, I don't need magic.
I'll go after him alone.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.689
Even if you could find him,

03:13.110 --> 03:15.021
do you really think
you can just walk up to him

03:15.112 --> 03:16.613
and stab him in the heart
with your sword?

03:16.989 --> 03:19.401
Well, I prefer my hook,
but I can't find that now.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.693
You're not going anywhere.

03:20.785 --> 03:21.865
I deserve my vengeance.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.108
You're right.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.869
You're right, you do.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.450
And with the Dark One gone,

03:27.625 --> 03:32.244
we can search for the one magical item
that can actually kill him here.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.581
His dagger.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.387

03:40.554 --> 03:42.215
Yeah, that probably wouldn't fly
as an alias.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.382
Your magic globe didn't give you
an apartment number?

03:45.476 --> 03:47.091
It doesn't work that way.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.677
Do any of these names
mean anything to you?

03:49.772 --> 03:51.763
Well, names are what I traffic in,
but sadly, no.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.689

03:54.777 --> 03:57.814
Well, or it could just be vacant.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.190
You might traffic in names and magic,

03:59.281 --> 04:00.896
but I traffic in finding people
who don't wanna be found.

04:00.991 --> 04:04.358

advertise their whereabouts.

-Yeah.

talking about? Who's Gold?

Where I was from? The whole time?

of sick, twisted plan?

Did you even care about me at all?

06:06.992 --> 06:08.948
-Emma, Emma...
-I wanna know. I want the truth. All of it.

06:09.078 --> 06:12.570
Okay, fine! We gotta get off the street.
We can't do it here, out in the open.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.083

running from that man.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.748
I'm not gonna let him catch me.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.873
There's a bar down the street,
we can talk there.

you're gonna tell me, tell me now.

Well, my son has been running away
for a long time now.

he's equally adept at it.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.817

07:17.896 --> 07:19.511
For giving me up.

She thought it was the best for me then.
That's why she did it.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.147
So, if you didn't know,
then you were just using me.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.521
You just needed someone to take
the fall for all the watches that you stole.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.197
I wasn't using you.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.071
When we met, I didn't know,

08:15.537 --> 08:16.788
but I found out.

08:22.878 --> 08:23.913
How?

08:26.298 --> 08:30.758
When I went to sell the watches,
I ran into a friend of yours.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.085
August.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.838
When you see what I have in here,
you're gonna listen.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.348
You're gonna believe every word I say.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.645
Yeah, right.

08:48.487 --> 08:53.447
You left me and let me go to prison

-I loved you.

By letting me go to jail?

09:03.961 --> 09:05.076

09:09.091 --> 09:14.302
Are you telling me that us meeting
was a coincidence?

09:14.972 --> 09:17.588
Because how the hell did that happen
if it wasn't in your plan

09:17.683 --> 09:18.889
or your father's?

09:20.102 --> 09:21.638
Think about it.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.099
He wanted you to break the curse.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.185
Us meeting, that could have stopped it.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.557
Maybe it was fate.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.317
You believe in that?

09:32.948 --> 09:35.940
You know, there's not a ton
about my father

09:36.034 --> 09:37.865

that there are no coincidences.

happens by design.

conspire to make it happen.

you wanna call it, the point is,

came from us being together.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.852
I bet Milah isn't even pregnant.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.983
You just said that
so I would give you water.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.857
And now you're trying
to trick me into deserting.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.280
You shall see.

14:28.118 --> 14:32.953
Tomorrow, when you see
the army ride cows into battle,

14:33.040 --> 14:36.123
you will know I speak the truth.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.369
Cows?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.460
And who's gonna man the catapults?
Milkmaids?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.172
I have had enough of your fiendish lies.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.542
There's no escaping it.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.179
You will have a son.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.088
And your actions
will leave him fatherless.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.394
Wait, Gold's son is Henry's father?

14:57.481 --> 14:58.470
EMMA: / know. / know.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.389
The millions of questions you have,
I have, too.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.145
But the problem is,
it doesn't matter right now,

15:02.235 --> 15:03.691
because I don't know what to do.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.896
Please tell me you're not calling to
ask me to tell you to keep it from him?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.739
Henry thinks his father is dead.
I told him that for a reason.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.948
I wanna protect him.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.242
No matter what this man did,

15:12.621 --> 15:14.703
Henry has a right to know
who his father is.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.408
The truth about your parents.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.499
Emma, you of all people
should know how important that is.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.628
I don't want Henry to get hurt.
I just want to protect him.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.956
Are you sure this is
about protecting Henry,

15:26.343 --> 15:27.503
and not yourself?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.553
Why are you so nervous?

15:40.482 --> 15:42.643
When I found my mom, Iwas excited.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.900
Because I have the benefit
of a little more life experience.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.949
I know that things don't always happen
the way we want them to.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.990
Sure, but in my book,
it says that you could see the future.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.452
Why can't you just look and see
what's gonna happen?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.087
Well, that ability is complicated.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.214
I didn't always have it.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.845
And then, when I did,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.140
well, it's maybe not the gift
one would expect.

16:18.228 --> 16:22.642
Seeing the inevitable
can be a terrible price.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.896
But you wouldn't have to worry
about stuff. You'd just know.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.775
But that's the great trap.

16:32.117 --> 16:36.326
The future is like a puzzle.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.364
With missing pieces. Difficult to read.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.585
And never, never what you think.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.175
(DOOR OPENS)

16:49.384 --> 16:50.464
Hey.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.796
Did you find him?

16:53.805 --> 16:57.343
I'm sorry. Your son got away.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.686
Who are you?

17:12.199 --> 17:15.783
So it is true.
You really don't remember anything.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.912
Were we friends?

17:19.247 --> 17:20.748
We spent some time together.

17:22.792 --> 17:26.501
But I'm here because I believe
you can help me find something

17:26.838 --> 17:29.170
that belongs to Rumplestiltskin.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.252
Who?

17:31.509 --> 17:32.885
Mr. Gold.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.883
(STUTTERS) I don't know him.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.929
Not anymore.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.268
But you did.

18:12.008 --> 18:15.341
Shouldn't we be pillaging his shop
or ransacking his home?

18:15.679 --> 18:18.671
That would be the obvious choice, yes.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.223
But Gold wouldn't risk crossing
the town line and losing his memory

18:22.811 --> 18:25.848
without entrusting the dagger's
location to someone.

18:25.939 --> 18:26.974
Belle.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.649
My guess is she hid it
in one of her beloved books.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.893
Impressive, Regina.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.148
Thank you, Mother.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.149
I'll be impressed when I'm holding
the dagger in my hand.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.869
No. It should be here.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.073
Well, it's not, is it? May we go now?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.293
Hold on.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.339
What's this?

19:01.850 --> 19:04.057
Yes, crude.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.644
To the untrained eye,
a child's scribbles. But to a pirate?

19:09.232 --> 19:10.267
It's a map.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.813
Gold may not have hidden
the dagger here,

19:13.903 --> 19:16.280
but I believe he's left us
the next best thing.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.230
Its location.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.982
Can you read it?

19:21.077 --> 19:25.320
Well, lucky for you ladies, I'm quite
adept at finding buried treasure.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.998
So, Rumplestiltskin
is Henry's grandfather?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.168
Apparently.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.296
But I'm his grandfather.

19:35.759 --> 19:36.748
You can have more than one.

19:39.429 --> 19:44.765
So, his step-grandmother is Regina.
The Evil Queen.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.092
Actually his step-great—grandmother.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.767
-And she's also his adoptive mother.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.061

20:13.046 --> 20:16.459
But he lives here. He'll be back.
And I'll be waiting.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.799
Stop. You can'tjust break in.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.174
Yeah, well, actually,
that's something I'm quite adept at.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.879
He might not come back.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.102
Look, finding people
is what you do, Ms. Swan.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.097
I'm simply going to assist you.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.182
There may be information in here.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.228
Who he is.
What he does. Who he loves.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.019
No, don't do this.
There are things called laws.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.571

-No...

20:42.826 --> 20:44.111
You could get arrested.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.113

against me.

They're not dead, but they can't fight.
Which means they get sent home.

into battle. We'll be riding.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.249
Riding? Riding what?

21:39.883 --> 21:42.966
What kind of question is that?
A horse, of course.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.668
Now, grab yourself a cow. Get ready.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.132
What did you say?

21:47.974 --> 21:52.593
A cow. The saddles we just got in,
made from the finest leather.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.641
We call them cows. Grab yours,

21:56.274 --> 21:59.983

You find something, dearie?

23:50.972 --> 23:54.305
Nothing.
Itjust looks like a dream catcher.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.801
Yeah, well, if it's nothing,
why are you still holding it?

24:00.398 --> 24:01.433
You're lying to me.

24:01.649 --> 24:02.889
Just get back to looking, okay?

24:02.984 --> 24:06.647

-But you talked to him.

-Don't put words in my mouth!

-Did you do it to...
-Yes!

A seer told me I was gonna die
in the battle.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.684

a seer told you to do it?

26:03.813 --> 26:05.804
She was right about everything else.

26:06.482 --> 26:11.522
I left the front to be with you.
You and Baelfire.

26:12.697 --> 26:15.154
You left because you were afraid.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.321
No.

thought you were, a coward.

-Just like your father.

I will never, ever do that to my son.

to a fate much worse.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.853
You could have fought, Rumple.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.947
You could have died.

26:59.577 --> 27:03.536
You don't mean that.
You don't mean that.

-Eleven!

Is this my son?

No. My dad was a fireman. He died.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.539
That's what you told me.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.249
You said...

29:20.927 --> 29:23.839
Is this my son?

29:30.019 --> 29:31.008
(WHISPERS) Yes.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.827
Henry. Henry?

29:54.543 --> 29:58.786
Baelfire. Please, please.
All I want is a chance to be heard.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.170
Get out.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.044
Look, you came back to protect Emma.

30:03.970 --> 30:07.554
To show that she had lived up
to her end of her bargain with me.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.175
And now she has. So you can go.

30:09.266 --> 30:13.430
No. Our deal was for her
to get you to talk to me.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.559
If you truly want her deal to be fulfilled,

30:19.110 --> 30:20.316
you have but one choice.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.441
You have to talk to me.

30:25.908 --> 30:26.988
You got three minutes.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.324
Hey. No, I'm okay, yeah.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.910
No, they said I'm good to go.

30:39.005 --> 30:42.418
But, you know, I think I'm gonna
stay here for a little while.

30:43.092 --> 30:46.334
"Why"?
Well, take a look at this and see.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.767
I give you the location of the dagger.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.440
Well done, Hook.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.484
We'll take it from here.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.740
No! You promised me!

31:11.037 --> 31:12.277
(GROANS)

31:14.123 --> 31:17.581
The Kris Dagger is much too powerful
to be wasted on you.

31:19.420 --> 31:23.584
So, is this what it was all about?

31:24.842 --> 31:27.458
Getting Rumple's dagger
so you can obtain his dark powers?

31:27.678 --> 31:30.795
If we possess the dagger,
we control the Dark One.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.056
And when he returns to Storybrooke,
we can command him

31:34.143 --> 31:37.135
to kill Snow White,
Prince Charming and Emma.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.099
Our enemies will be vanquished,

31:39.273 --> 31:45.018
and you will be blameless in the eyes
of the only person who matters.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.478
Henry.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.285
So, that's him.

32:01.629 --> 32:02.709
Yeah.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.667
Why didn't you tell me?

32:08.302 --> 32:10.588
Because I never thought
I would see him again.

32:10.679 --> 32:11.668
I never wanted to.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.680
Why not?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.849
He was a thief, Henry. A liar.

32:21.357 --> 32:22.346
A bad guy.

32:24.527 --> 32:26.017
And he broke my heart.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.862
I could have taken it, you know?
The truth.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.196
I know.

32:32.993 --> 32:36.952
He was just a part of my life
I wanted to forget.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.701
That's why I didn't tell you.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.121
I was thinking of me. Not you.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.668
(SCOFFS)

32:50.010 --> 32:53.252
I thought you were different.
But you're just like her.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.552
Regina.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.677
She always lied to me, too.

33:00.521 --> 33:01.556
I'm sorry.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.357
I want to meet my dad.

33:14.577 --> 33:15.862
Clock's ticking.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.737
I know I've made mistakes.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.910
But you must believe me.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.868
(WHISPERS) I want to make up for it.

33:28.757 --> 33:31.590
There's no greater pain than regret.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.598
Try abandonment.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.764
Please. Let me make it up to you.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.389
How are you gonna do that?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.605
I grew up alone.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.357
I grew up without a father.
You can make up for that?

33:49.445 --> 33:51.436
Yeah. Yes, I can.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.396
Two minutes.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.199
Come with me to Storybrooke.

33:57.453 --> 33:58.738
(WHISPERS) There's magic there.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.738
I can turn the clock back.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.412
Make you 14 again.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.702
We can start over.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.538
Fourteen... I don't wanna be 14 again.

34:10.633 --> 34:11.873
Are you insane?

34:12.051 --> 34:13.791
I can't make up for the lost time,

34:13.886 --> 34:16.969
but I can take away
the memories, the pain.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.297
Take away who I am? No, thanks.

34:20.601 --> 34:21.636
One minute.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.430
Bae, please.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.141
Give me a chance.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.060
You once loved me.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.073
You were once a good man.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.481
I can be that man again.

34:37.785 --> 34:38.820
I've changed.

34:40.079 --> 34:45.119
Look, I came here to this city

34:45.584 --> 34:46.573
without magic.

34:46.669 --> 34:50.253
Yeah, yeah, and you're still trying to
use it to make up for your mistakes.

34:50.673 --> 34:53.164
Still think that that can make it all better.
It won't. You can't.

34:53.717 --> 34:54.706
(NEAL SCOFFS)

34:54.969 --> 34:57.255
You have no idea what I've lived with.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.467
You're so worried about you,
you know what I've dealt with?

35:02.017 --> 35:06.181
Every night, for more years
than you could know,

35:08.023 --> 35:12.687
the last thing I see before sleep
is the image of you.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.811
You and me over that pit.

35:17.491 --> 35:20.983
Your hand wrapped around mine.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.488
And then you open your grip.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.871
And as I fall away,
all I can see is your face.

35:32.047 --> 35:37.007
Choosing all this crap over me.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.714
Letting me go.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.841
Now, it's my turn.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.469
Now, I'm letting you go.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.977
I'm sorry.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.180
I don't care.

35:51.734 --> 35:55.067
I didn't get closure, so you don't either.
You gotta go.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.062
Oh, Bae...

35:59.408 --> 36:00.739
No. Time's up.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.343
I've been expecting you.

36:26.602 --> 36:29.264
Then you know exactly
why I came here.

36:29.355 --> 36:33.769
What I foretold during the Ogres War
has finally come to pass.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.062
Well, in a manner of speaking.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.354
I hobbled myself on the battlefield,

36:40.115 --> 36:42.367
was branded a coward,

36:43.243 --> 36:45.905
my wife ran away and left me,

36:46.080 --> 36:48.742
then my son was called to the front.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.034
Oh.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.207
Then I became the Dark One,

36:52.294 --> 36:54.580
then Bae left me.

36:54.755 --> 36:59.124
So, yes, my actions on the battlefield
left my son fatherless.

36:59.635 --> 37:04.504
But would have been nice to know
about all the pesky details.

37:04.598 --> 37:07.965
Knowing would not
have made a difference.

37:09.061 --> 37:12.553
You still would have been powerless
to escape your fate.

37:12.648 --> 37:13.979
(CHUCKLES)

37:14.650 --> 37:17.266
Just like you.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.567
Now, you know
exactly why I came here.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.822
(CHOKING) You want to find your son.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.280
4ndeed.
iGASPS)

37:38.799 --> 37:42.383
(WHISPERING) You Will find him.

37:43.178 --> 37:47.922
How? And this time,
don't leave out a single detail.

37:50.227 --> 37:53.185
It will not be an easy path.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.597
It will take many years.

37:58.986 --> 38:00.647
And require a curse.

38:01.780 --> 38:07.867
A curse powerful enough
to rip everyone from this land.

38:10.706 --> 38:12.867
Yes, yes, there's more. I know it.
Tell me.

38:14.251 --> 38:17.459
You will not cast the curse.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.378
Someone else will.

38:20.674 --> 38:24.337
And you will not break
the curse. (GASPS)

38:24.845 --> 38:26.881
Someone else will.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.428
Tell me!

38:30.058 --> 38:34.347
I don't know.
Even my powers have limits.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.723
Ah-ah-ah.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.602
Not good enough, dearie.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.233
(SHRIEKS)

38:44.323 --> 38:49.408
(CHOKES) If you want to see the path
you must take, there is only one way.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.828
Take this burden from me.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.747
Mmm.

38:58.712 --> 39:00.418
-G|ad|y.
-(GASPS)

39:01.840 --> 39:03.171
(SCREAMS)

39:08.680 --> 39:09.669
He wants to meet you.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.005
You weren't gonna tell me about him.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.259
No, I wasn't.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.802
Yeah, well, he's my kid, too.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.933
So you don't get to make that decision
by yourself anymore.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.355
Great. Go talk to him, then.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.358
(SIGHS)

39:24.446 --> 39:25.481
Wait.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.442
But don't break his heart.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.566
Trust me, I'm not gonna do to him
what he did to me.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.110
And what you did to me.

39:33.247 --> 39:34.236
(EXHALES)

39:34.331 --> 39:38.040
Okay. I get it, we're all messed up.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.085
What do you say we try to avoid that
with him? All right?

39:45.425 --> 39:46.460
All right.

39:55.686 --> 39:57.551
So, you're my dad.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.135
Yeah.

40:01.858 --> 40:02.893
I'm Henry.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.479
It's nice to meet you, Henry.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.399
Sorry it took so long.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.986
It's okay. You didn't know.

40:41.315 --> 40:46.275
I can't see anything. It's too much!

40:46.987 --> 40:48.272
It's nothing but a jumble.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.358
The future is a puzzle

40:50.824 --> 40:53.440
with many pieces to be sorted.

40:53.660 --> 40:59.121
In time, you will learn to separate
what can be from what will be.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.122
-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

41:02.044 --> 41:05.457
This is why you wanted
to give me your power.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.079
To free yourself from this torment.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.632
In time, you will work it all out.

41:11.678 --> 41:12.713
Wait.

41:14.890 --> 41:19.179
As gratitude,
I offer you one piece of the puzzle.

41:22.564 --> 41:26.148
You will be reunited with your son

41:27.194 --> 41:30.937
and it will come
in a most unexpected way.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.813
How?

41:35.827 --> 41:40.116
A boy. A young boy will lead you to him.

41:40.666 --> 41:46.036
But beware, Rumplestiltskin,
for that boy is more than he appears.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.668
He will lead you to what you seek.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.966
But there will be a price.

41:54.262 --> 41:58.050
The boy will be your undoing.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.733
Then I'll just have to kill him.
