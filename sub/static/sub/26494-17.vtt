00:04.043 --> 00:06.210
Michael.
He's dead.

00:06.212 --> 00:07.378
Jack, a-are you, uh --

00:07.380 --> 00:08.680
I'm me again.

00:08.682 --> 00:10.315
You want to know
how much of my soul

00:10.317 --> 00:11.916
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

00:11.918 --> 00:13.985
- Yes.
- I don't know.

00:17.857 --> 00:20.091
Don't be afraid.

00:21.394 --> 00:22.927
You're an angel.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.363
You're special because you
heal people for <i>money.</i>

00:25.365 --> 00:27.365
You may have noticed,
around here,

00:27.367 --> 00:28.499
good life ain't cheap.

00:28.501 --> 00:30.902
I was a so-so angel,
but turns out,

00:30.904 --> 00:34.806
I am an excellent
businesswoman.

00:38.178 --> 00:40.011
- Why?
- I needed the truth.

00:40.013 --> 00:41.512
I needed revenge
for my family.

00:41.514 --> 00:43.081
You would've done
the same thing.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.882
I don't feel sorry
for <i>you,</i> Nick.

00:44.884 --> 00:46.751
I feel sorry for
the people you hurt

00:46.753 --> 00:48.286
and the people
you murdered.

00:48.288 --> 00:49.354
You can burn.

00:49.356 --> 00:50.555
When am I getting
out of here?

00:50.557 --> 00:51.989
Listen,
you piece of crap.

00:51.991 --> 00:54.325
You're gonna be locked up
for the rest of your life.

00:58.765 --> 01:00.465
You chose Lucifer.

01:00.467 --> 01:01.566
He chose me.

01:01.568 --> 01:02.734
Reject him, Nick.

01:02.736 --> 01:03.968
I can't.

01:03.970 --> 01:05.703
Where are you going?

01:05.705 --> 01:08.306
Wherever it's darkest,
wherever he is.

01:08.308 --> 01:10.475
Our field trip
is to see Donatello?

01:10.477 --> 01:11.509
We're worried
about you.

01:11.511 --> 01:12.810
How do you feel, Jack?

01:12.812 --> 01:13.911
I don't know.

01:13.913 --> 01:16.013
I know I don't
feel...nothing,

01:16.015 --> 01:20.051
but I don't feel
the same, either.

01:20.053 --> 01:21.819
Dean and I, we --
we want to talk to you

01:21.821 --> 01:24.222
about your powers.
- W-What about them?

01:24.224 --> 01:25.923
You know, you just
got 'em back, Jack.

01:25.925 --> 01:27.959
We want to make sure you're
comfortable with them again

01:27.961 --> 01:29.360
before you...

01:29.362 --> 01:30.595
Before you go
all X-Men.

01:30.597 --> 01:31.629
You understand that?

01:31.631 --> 01:32.897
I understand.

01:32.899 --> 01:36.167
I won't use my powers
without permission.

- Son of a bitch!
- What --

03:31.384 --> 03:33.551
I thought this was
supposed to relax him.

We're family.
It's our job.

03:53.006 --> 03:55.706
Well, it's annoying.

Jack...

You're here. I know.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.300
All right.
Winchester game night is a go --

04:22.302 --> 04:23.701
soon as Sammy gets back here

04:23.703 --> 04:27.071
with the two double-pepperoni
meat blasters

04:27.073 --> 04:28.806
and a pineapple.

04:28.808 --> 04:30.041
I like it.

04:30.043 --> 04:31.842
Yeah, it's like
a crime against humanity.

04:31.844 --> 04:32.810

play him that voicemail

and have him call me

16th-century
Burmese blood rubies.

06:14.881 --> 06:18.215
Five carats.
Excellent clarity.

06:18.217 --> 06:20.084
Castiel,
where did you get these?

06:20.086 --> 06:21.152
On a case.

06:21.154 --> 06:22.520
They are lightly cursed,

06:22.522 --> 06:24.689
but it's nothing
that would affect an angel.

06:24.691 --> 06:26.290
Uh-huh.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.825
And you're giving these
to me?

06:27.827 --> 06:31.729
No. No.
I-I need something.

06:31.731 --> 06:33.698
I need your help.

06:35.768 --> 06:37.835
To contact God.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.573
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.475
You forget, Anael,
I know you.

06:44.477 --> 06:47.778
I know what you did
before your demotion.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.981
When you were Joshua's
right hand.

06:50.983 --> 06:54.251
And I know that God spoke
to Joshua.

06:54.253 --> 06:56.987
And only to Joshua.

06:56.989 --> 06:59.290
Now, he's dead, but --

06:59.292 --> 07:01.459
but you understand
how they communicated.

07:01.461 --> 07:03.127
Why do you want to know?

07:03.129 --> 07:05.696
There's a nephilim --
Jack.

07:05.698 --> 07:06.964
Lucifer's son?

07:06.966 --> 07:09.366
Yes.

07:09.368 --> 07:10.768
Jack killed Michael.

07:10.770 --> 07:12.436
Good night,
sweet prince.

07:12.438 --> 07:16.240
But to do so, he -- he used
magic that consumed his soul.

07:16.242 --> 07:17.942
Not all of it, I hope,

07:17.944 --> 07:20.878
but we just don't know
how much Jack has left.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.180
And I've been looking
through all the lore,

07:23.182 --> 07:25.616
and it all says
the same thing.

07:25.618 --> 07:27.251
Only God
can restore a soul.

07:27.253 --> 07:28.986
And that's
why you need him.

07:28.988 --> 07:30.121
Right.

07:32.291 --> 07:36.293
The Winchesters -- they don't
know you're here, do they?

07:36.295 --> 07:38.896
Why do you say that?

07:38.898 --> 07:41.999
Oh, I don't know,
just a general reek

07:42.001 --> 07:45.436
of ill-conceived
lone-wolf desperation.

07:47.006 --> 07:48.739
Will you help me or not?

07:50.576 --> 07:52.843
Not. Sorry.

07:52.845 --> 07:56.413
You see,
Joshua never spoke to God.

07:56.415 --> 07:58.349
God spoke to <i>him.</i>

07:58.351 --> 08:00.251
There's a big difference.

08:02.655 --> 08:03.921
I see.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.025
But...

08:08.027 --> 08:10.127
there was a rumor.

08:10.129 --> 08:12.563
A whisper,
after the Fall.

08:12.565 --> 08:17.168
Joshua placed a long-distance
call, and God picked up.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.236
Okay. How?

08:19.238 --> 08:22.139
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

08:22.141 --> 08:24.074
But I know
someone who was,

08:24.076 --> 08:25.843
and I can take you
to them.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.213
I should be there
with you.

08:29.215 --> 08:30.948
<i>- It's fine.</i>
- No, it's not.

08:30.950 --> 08:32.448
You heard Donny's
message, right?

08:32.451 --> 08:34.251
Yeah, I did.
<i>He sounds like he's</i>

08:34.253 --> 08:36.419
<i>speaking in tongues --</i>
<i>like he's possessed again.</i>

08:36.422 --> 08:38.022
No, that's not --

08:38.024 --> 08:41.457
It's not Enochian. I-I-I think
it's Ancient Hebrew.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.092
- What's he saying?
<i>- We don't know yet.</i>

08:43.095 --> 08:44.428
I'm still working on it.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.831
- All right, well, work fast.
- Watch your back.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.165
That's the plan.

08:50.069 --> 08:54.004
Ancient Hebrew.
What the hell?

08:54.006 --> 08:56.140
Sammy sounds stressed.

08:57.877 --> 09:00.578
It's not just Sam.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.913
It's Jack...

09:02.915 --> 09:05.616
it's you.

09:05.618 --> 09:07.952
I just wish there
was something that I c--

09:07.954 --> 09:11.388
Hey. You're here, okay?
You're here.

09:14.961 --> 09:17.394
But I should've
been here more.

09:20.933 --> 09:23.367
But I know how I am.

09:23.369 --> 09:27.104
I can be closed off...

09:27.106 --> 09:29.673
and hard.

09:29.675 --> 09:32.743
Yeah, well, that's where
I get it from.

09:40.119 --> 09:42.086
Listen.

09:42.088 --> 09:45.089
I just need you
to know...

09:45.091 --> 09:47.925
I'm grateful.

09:47.927 --> 09:50.961

Donatello's message --

10:11.150 --> 10:13.751
It's from the Bible.

10:15.955 --> 10:19.189
It's -- it's Peter.

10:19.191 --> 10:21.859
Peter 5:8.

10:21.861 --> 10:23.627
Here.

10:23.629 --> 10:25.729
"Be sober, be vigilant,

10:25.731 --> 10:27.798
because your adversary
the Devil,

10:27.800 --> 10:30.367
as a roaring lion,
walketh about,

10:30.369 --> 10:33.637
seeking whom
he may devour."

10:50.056 --> 10:51.622
Donatello?!

10:51.624 --> 10:54.625
<i>Oh, please!</i>
<i>Dean! Please!</i>

10:54.627 --> 10:55.793
Donatello?!

10:55.795 --> 10:57.061
<i>Help me, Dean! Help!</i>

10:57.063 --> 11:00.898
<i>Ohh! Oh! Sam! Dean!</i>

11:00.900 --> 11:02.833
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

11:02.835 --> 11:05.936
Good. You made it.

11:13.117 --> 11:14.550
Where's Donatello?

11:14.552 --> 11:18.654
What, no "hey"?
"How ya been"?

11:24.428 --> 11:26.228
So it's just you, huh?

11:26.230 --> 11:28.730
Sammy's home sick?

11:28.732 --> 11:31.066
- How are you even --
- Here?

11:31.068 --> 11:33.702
Instead of rotting away in
a jail cell where you left me?

11:33.704 --> 11:36.238
Sort of a funny story...

11:36.240 --> 11:39.475
and by "funny,"
I mean a lot of people died.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.978
No one's here, but...

11:42.980 --> 11:45.047
I saw this in the trash.

11:45.049 --> 11:46.915
Dumpster diving.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.151
Classy, Mamabear.

11:49.153 --> 11:51.687
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

11:51.689 --> 11:56.358
I mean, I sort of injected
your friend with poison --

11:56.360 --> 11:58.193
thallium, to be exact.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.528
So he's got about a day

11:59.530 --> 12:01.330
before his internal organs
start shutting down.

12:01.332 --> 12:03.298
But that's just sort of
a "guesstimate."

12:03.300 --> 12:05.834
Why?

12:05.836 --> 12:07.603
To get
your attention.

12:08.572 --> 12:11.340
I mean, he was --
is, sorry <i>is --</i>

12:11.342 --> 12:13.842
one of your friends, right, and
you don't have a lot of those.

12:13.844 --> 12:15.577
I'm not buying
a word of this.

12:15.579 --> 12:17.546
No?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.820
Hit the live-stream
button.

12:36.167 --> 12:38.734
You can save him
if you can find him.

12:42.273 --> 12:43.872
Where is he?!

12:43.874 --> 12:46.074
Ooh, the angry voice.

12:46.076 --> 12:47.910
Hey, if you kill me,
you kill him.

12:47.912 --> 12:50.012
Do it.
What do I got to live for?

12:50.014 --> 12:51.380
Go.

12:54.351 --> 12:55.951
What do you want?

12:55.953 --> 12:58.654
I want to talk.

13:26.650 --> 13:27.849
We're closed.

13:27.851 --> 13:29.551
Even for us,
Methuselah?

13:29.553 --> 13:30.953
Yeah.

13:30.955 --> 13:33.488
We're friends
of Joshua.

13:33.490 --> 13:35.691
Joshua didn't have
any friends.

13:35.693 --> 13:36.858
Except you.

13:36.860 --> 13:38.393
You sheltered him
after the Fall.

13:38.395 --> 13:42.364
I didn't "shelter" --
We were roommates.

13:42.366 --> 13:44.466
Okay?
He made a mean lasagna.

13:44.468 --> 13:46.902
You saw him try to contact God.
How did he do it?

13:46.904 --> 13:49.004
Yeah.
Maybe try asking <i>him.</i>

13:49.006 --> 13:51.440
Can't. Dead.

13:51.442 --> 13:53.242
Well, guess
you're outta luck.

13:54.778 --> 13:57.546
No. You'll tell me, or I'll
burn this place to the ground

13:57.548 --> 13:59.548
and you with it.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.717
Kiddo, how old am I?

14:01.719 --> 14:04.219
Go for it.
Put me out of my misery.

14:04.221 --> 14:07.155
Is that really
what you want?

14:09.893 --> 14:12.828
The, um,
thingamajig he used,

14:12.830 --> 14:14.930
it's around here
somewhere.

14:14.932 --> 14:16.465
Where?

14:16.467 --> 14:18.734
I don't know.
Somewhere.

14:18.736 --> 14:20.168
You're angels, right?

14:20.170 --> 14:22.337
I'm sure you'll know it
when you see it.

14:23.941 --> 14:25.274
Or not.

14:41.025 --> 14:44.760
Whoa! Hey. Hey!
Not now. Okay?

14:44.762 --> 14:46.595
Not yet.

14:53.003 --> 14:55.370
But he was -- He was just
sitting there waiting for you?

14:55.372 --> 14:57.506
That doesn't make any sense.
What kind of game is he playing here?

14:57.508 --> 14:58.974
I don't know. If you ask me,
that psycho's seen

14:58.976 --> 15:00.809
way too many
'90s serial-killer movies.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.844
Nick doesn't even know
Donatello.

15:02.846 --> 15:04.513
Lucifer did.

15:04.515 --> 15:07.382
It doesn't make any sense to me,
either, but Donatello --

15:07.384 --> 15:08.950
we're -- we're running
out of time.

15:08.952 --> 15:10.519
The poison we can handle --
thallium.

15:10.521 --> 15:12.721
The antidote is Prussian Blue.
We have some of that here.

15:12.723 --> 15:14.890
A-And the live feed
Nick showed you,

15:14.892 --> 15:17.826
um, maybe
I can hack that?

15:17.828 --> 15:19.194
Good. Great.

15:19.196 --> 15:21.296
But it's gonna take time.
Maybe more than we have.

15:21.298 --> 15:24.166
All right, well, Nick said
he wanted to talk.

15:24.168 --> 15:26.935
- So let's talk.
- Yeah, let's talk.

15:26.937 --> 15:29.137
- Hey, hey.
- No, no, no.

15:29.139 --> 15:31.306
- What?
- I need you to stay here.

15:31.308 --> 15:32.459
Why?

15:32.483 --> 15:34.210
The way you are
right now --

15:34.211 --> 15:36.945
if Nick looks at you wrong,
you're gonna waste him.

15:36.947 --> 15:39.648
That can't happen!

15:40.684 --> 15:43.018
All right. Yeah. Sure.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.053
Not yet.

15:45.055 --> 15:47.155
Right.

15:55.032 --> 15:56.298
Sam...

15:56.300 --> 15:59.668
Donatello's in this
because of me.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.037
A police officer is dead
because of me.

16:02.039 --> 16:05.941
I'm the one who let Nick go,
I'm the one who...

16:08.178 --> 16:09.745
What was I thinking?

16:09.747 --> 16:11.780
You thought
he deserved a chance.

16:11.782 --> 16:13.849
Yeah, well, he didn't.

16:13.851 --> 16:16.218
Sam, look at me.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.620
Nick's choices are his.

16:18.622 --> 16:21.022
Just his.

16:21.024 --> 16:23.024
You didn't know th--

16:23.026 --> 16:24.459
That's not an excuse.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.561
No one's making excuses,
but --

16:26.563 --> 16:29.631
You gave him a chance
because you felt for him...

16:31.168 --> 16:32.734
...because
you're a good man.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.241
You are.

16:39.243 --> 16:42.411
It's one of the reasons
I'm so proud of you.

16:51.255 --> 16:52.954
Are you insane?

16:52.956 --> 16:54.856
This is Mulberry silk.

16:54.858 --> 16:56.425
Sorry.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.061
So, Methuselah said...

17:00.063 --> 17:03.365
We'd know it when
we'd see it. Right.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.233
No.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.836
Well, <i>you</i> might.

17:07.838 --> 17:09.805
When you were working
for Joshua, did you ever --

17:09.807 --> 17:12.840
Even if we found
Joshua's batphone,

17:12.843 --> 17:14.876
God's not gonna care.

17:14.877 --> 17:16.711
- You wanna know how I know?
- How?

17:16.713 --> 17:19.114
You ever wonder
why a vaunted apprentice

17:19.116 --> 17:20.848
became a lowly
button pusher?

17:20.851 --> 17:25.053
Well, I heard that Joshua
offered you more responsibility,

17:25.055 --> 17:26.488
and you just walked away.

17:28.025 --> 17:30.158
I believed in Heaven.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.793
You know, our mission.

17:31.795 --> 17:33.762
I believed, Castiel.

17:33.764 --> 17:36.932
But then I got to Earth, and I saw that
it wasn't the paradise God promised.

17:36.934 --> 17:39.034
I mean, there was
so much hate...

17:39.036 --> 17:41.303
so much suffering.

17:41.305 --> 17:43.872
So I asked Joshua --

17:43.874 --> 17:46.675
I mean, these were
God's creations --

17:46.677 --> 17:49.878
his perfect people.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.380
Why wasn't he helping them?

17:52.382 --> 17:54.382
And do you know
what he said?

17:54.384 --> 17:56.017
No.

17:56.019 --> 17:57.185
"God doesn't meddle."

17:57.187 --> 18:00.055
He doesn't meddle?

18:00.057 --> 18:03.258
Well, I do.
So I do.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.495
And here I thought you just performed
miracles for the money.

18:08.532 --> 18:10.866
Well, you haven't been
paying attention, then.

18:10.868 --> 18:13.134
I do them for me.

18:13.136 --> 18:14.870
I don't need Heaven.

18:14.872 --> 18:16.805
And I don't need God.

18:16.807 --> 18:19.774
And...

18:19.776 --> 18:22.177
I'm happy, Castiel.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.846
Really?

18:24.848 --> 18:27.182
Because
that sounds lonely.

18:28.485 --> 18:30.352
We're all lonely,

18:30.354 --> 18:32.153
because we're all alone.

18:32.155 --> 18:36.258
From ant to lion
to human to angel.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.927
Every last one of us.

18:38.929 --> 18:41.596
You know,
he <i>does</i> meddle.

18:41.598 --> 18:45.100
God reached down,
and he brought me back to life.

18:45.102 --> 18:47.502
So he saves one angel...

18:47.504 --> 18:52.007
and watches millions of people
die screaming, every day.

18:53.844 --> 18:56.378
What does that say
about him?

19:02.286 --> 19:05.487
Where's Donatello?

19:05.489 --> 19:07.822
You having fun?

19:07.824 --> 19:11.092
Oh, yeah.
Having a riot.

19:11.094 --> 19:13.662
I get you, Dean.

19:13.664 --> 19:15.463
You and me,

19:15.465 --> 19:17.499
we're almost like brothers,
you know.

19:17.501 --> 19:21.570
Michael, you,
Lucifer, me --

19:21.572 --> 19:22.904
we both know what it's like

19:22.906 --> 19:26.508
to be hog-tied
to a nuclear warhead, man.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.777
Mm.

19:31.348 --> 19:33.348
Cut the crap.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.416
Where is he?

19:37.754 --> 19:41.389
You're never the same after
something like that, are ya?

19:41.391 --> 19:44.059
Being one
with one of them.

19:44.061 --> 19:46.461
It changes you.

19:46.463 --> 19:49.464
Makes you more than human.

19:49.466 --> 19:51.466
Come on, Dean, admit it.

19:51.468 --> 19:54.135
With Michael,
you were a prince.

19:54.137 --> 19:56.871
Now you're
just a broken Hunter.

19:56.873 --> 19:59.307
You're too stupid
to know you've been beat.

20:00.978 --> 20:04.012
Beat? What are you
beating me at?

20:04.014 --> 20:05.347
Hmm?

20:05.349 --> 20:08.984
Come on, Nick.

20:08.986 --> 20:11.019
What's this all about?

20:12.756 --> 20:15.056
I want to see my son.

20:16.927 --> 20:19.828
<i>His</i> son?
He said that?

20:19.830 --> 20:22.764
He says he wants to
talk to Jack...alone.

20:22.766 --> 20:25.333
No.

20:25.335 --> 20:27.168
Absolutely not.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.603
I'm not afraid of him.

20:28.605 --> 20:33.141
Nick's cracked. He's friggin'
Cocoa Puffs, okay?

20:35.879 --> 20:37.946
Sam?

20:39.549 --> 20:40.475
I mean --

20:40.499 --> 20:42.385
"I mean"?
What do you mean, you mean?

20:42.386 --> 20:44.419
I-I mean...

20:44.421 --> 20:47.188
Look, finding Donatello
is going slowly, Dean,

20:47.190 --> 20:50.525
and Nick is locked
down in our bunker.

20:50.527 --> 20:52.127
How's he even a threat?

20:52.129 --> 20:53.928
He's <i>always</i> a threat.

20:55.866 --> 20:59.968
Donatello helped me,
and now he needs my help.

21:02.372 --> 21:04.005
He's my friend.

21:07.010 --> 21:10.245
And I don't think
we have another choice.

21:27.831 --> 21:29.898
Hey, sonny boy.

21:29.900 --> 21:30.999
Where's Donatello?

21:31.001 --> 21:34.235
Wow.
You're so tough.

21:34.237 --> 21:36.037
That's your pop,
you realize.

21:36.039 --> 21:37.672
My father was a monster.

21:37.674 --> 21:39.607
Everybody's a monster.

21:39.609 --> 21:40.975
Even your three dads --

21:40.977 --> 21:42.544
how many innocent people
you think they've killed?

21:42.546 --> 21:45.013
Answer the question!

21:45.015 --> 21:47.649
He loved you.

21:47.651 --> 21:50.552
You know that?

21:50.554 --> 21:52.087
He did.

21:52.089 --> 21:54.556
I felt it.

21:54.558 --> 21:56.591
He loved you so much...

21:56.593 --> 21:59.527
and you broke his heart.

22:04.568 --> 22:06.768
Of course, I'm talking
about the <i>old</i> you.

22:06.770 --> 22:08.403
You with the soul.

22:10.407 --> 22:14.109
Yeah. Kermit the Prophet
told me all about your sitch.

22:14.111 --> 22:17.584
What's that like, not having
a soul? Must be relaxing.

22:17.585 --> 22:18.906
I have a soul.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.883
I don't know.
I don't -- I don't see it.

22:20.884 --> 22:23.685
I'm looking right at you,
and I see nothing.

22:23.687 --> 22:24.819
I have a soul!

22:40.237 --> 22:41.436
Y-You good?

22:45.675 --> 22:48.777
Sorry. I'm sorry.

22:48.779 --> 22:51.346
I'm s-- sorry.

22:51.348 --> 22:53.014
I'm serious.

23:03.228 --> 23:04.961
How'd it go?

23:04.963 --> 23:07.129
Did he...?

23:08.900 --> 23:13.669
Nick. He'll show us
where to find Donatello.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.841
<i>Mama!</i>

23:18.843 --> 23:20.743
<i>Mama!</i>

23:20.745 --> 23:23.145
<i>Mama.</i>

23:24.749 --> 23:26.449
Ugh!

23:26.451 --> 23:29.285
Yeah. I'm done.

23:29.287 --> 23:32.255
Look, I just stepped
on a rat, so --

23:32.257 --> 23:33.923
- Anael --
- Skip it.

23:33.925 --> 23:35.591
Skip the whole
judgmental crap

23:35.593 --> 23:37.560
designed to play
at my insecurities,

23:37.562 --> 23:39.862
and I will skip
my inevitable witty reply

23:39.864 --> 23:41.797
about the real reason
you're doing all this.

23:41.799 --> 23:43.866
What do you mean
the real reason?

23:43.868 --> 23:46.202
I'm doing this for Jack.

23:46.204 --> 23:48.371
No, you're not.

23:48.373 --> 23:50.273
You're doing this
because you're afraid.

23:50.275 --> 23:52.775
Because in your mind,
it'd be easier to call God

23:52.777 --> 23:55.144
than to tell Sam and Dean
Winchester the truth.

23:55.146 --> 23:57.680
The truth?

23:57.682 --> 24:00.917
Jack's soul is gone,
Castiel.

24:00.919 --> 24:03.586
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

24:03.588 --> 24:07.056
Look. I don't want to say all
that and hurt your feelings,

24:07.058 --> 24:10.993
so...what do you say
we call it a night?

24:22.473 --> 24:24.707
Boy, that Jack has...

24:24.709 --> 24:27.310
got issues, right?

24:38.323 --> 24:40.756
You throwin' in
the towel?

24:42.393 --> 24:44.193
Hey.

24:45.463 --> 24:46.829
Our deal?

24:59.377 --> 25:01.110
I've seen that before.

25:01.112 --> 25:02.812
Where?

25:02.814 --> 25:05.581
Crystal shop? A dollar store?
Ren fair?

25:05.583 --> 25:07.817
No.

25:09.621 --> 25:13.155
The one I know, it -- it glows
in the presence of -- of God.

25:13.157 --> 25:15.391
- This is what we're looking for.
- Good eye.

25:15.393 --> 25:18.394
Joshua forged it
after he Fell.

25:18.396 --> 25:20.196
That thing talks to God?

25:20.198 --> 25:22.031
Only one way to find out.

25:34.045 --> 25:37.880
God...

25:37.882 --> 25:40.616
I don't know where you are.
I don't know if you can hear me.

25:40.618 --> 25:42.518
But please.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.489
Sam, Dean -- we need you.

25:46.491 --> 25:48.257
Please.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.333
Yeah, it never worked
for Joshua, either.

26:12.877 --> 26:14.977
So, the warehouse
is just down there.

26:14.979 --> 26:16.178
Want me to show you?

26:16.180 --> 26:17.865
No.
You're gonna stay here.

26:18.230 --> 26:19.616
All by my lonesome?

26:19.617 --> 26:22.618
Look, you try anything funny,
Sammy's gonna shoot you.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.952
Anything happens to me --

26:23.954 --> 26:26.288
Wait. Let me guess.
Sammy's gonna shoot me.

26:26.290 --> 26:27.890
Yeah, to start.

26:27.892 --> 26:30.092
Here. Antidote.
Donatello.

26:39.103 --> 26:40.769
It's too bad.

26:40.771 --> 26:43.338
I would have really enjoyed
giving God a piece of my mind.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.808
But what can I say.
I'm always right.

26:48.145 --> 26:50.112
So, what are you
gonna do now?

26:50.827 --> 26:52.627
Go home.

26:52.629 --> 26:55.196
Go home and tell Sam and Dean
the truth.

26:55.198 --> 26:57.898
And then?

26:57.900 --> 27:00.468
I don't know.

27:03.172 --> 27:04.605
Oh.

27:06.743 --> 27:08.776
Thank you.

27:08.778 --> 27:10.745
It's been swell.

27:10.747 --> 27:13.314
Do you need a ride?

27:13.316 --> 27:15.149
I'll call a cab.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.320
Anael.

27:19.322 --> 27:21.756
You know,
you're not <i>always</i> right.

27:21.758 --> 27:25.226
Just because God's not with us
doesn't mean we're alone.

27:25.228 --> 27:28.829
Why? Because we all
have each other?

27:28.831 --> 27:30.965
Yes.

27:36.139 --> 27:38.539
You hear
from Sam and Dean?

27:38.541 --> 27:39.740
No, not yet.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.208
What's all this?

27:41.210 --> 27:44.145
Some stuff we found
at Donatello's.

27:44.147 --> 27:46.380
It's not helping.

27:46.382 --> 27:48.249
This...

27:48.251 --> 27:49.850
this was grace.

27:51.387 --> 27:52.787
Can't you feel it?

28:05.368 --> 28:09.070
This was filled
with angelic grace.

28:27.790 --> 28:30.524
It's nice that
we're finally alone.

28:30.526 --> 28:33.761
I feel like I never get a chance
to talk to you anymore.

28:38.134 --> 28:41.502
♪ Oh, Sammy boy, Sammy boy ♪

28:41.504 --> 28:44.672
♪ Your phone,
your phone is calling ♪

28:44.674 --> 28:47.875
Mom?

28:47.877 --> 28:49.377
Mom? Hey.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.079
♪ Sammy boy,
oh, Sammy boy ♪

28:52.081 --> 28:53.681
♪ The phone is calling ♪

28:53.683 --> 28:57.785
No. He's not back yet.
Yeah.

29:09.599 --> 29:10.965
Hey.

29:14.504 --> 29:16.837
All right.

29:21.878 --> 29:23.310
He's sure?

29:25.148 --> 29:26.514
Damn it.

29:33.523 --> 29:36.123
Out of the car!
Get out of the car!

29:36.125 --> 29:37.491
All right, all right,
all right.

29:37.493 --> 29:39.326
Whoa. Whoa!

29:39.328 --> 29:40.761
Oh, whoa, whoa.

29:40.763 --> 29:42.530
Was that Mamabear?

29:42.532 --> 29:44.165
There was never
any poison.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.267
You injected Donatello
with angel grace.

29:46.269 --> 29:47.568
Why?!

29:47.570 --> 29:49.937
Wow.
She figured it out.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.806
- That's good.
- Talk!

29:51.808 --> 29:55.509
Prophets are sort of
like old CB radios.

29:55.511 --> 29:58.979
You boost their power or you
mess with their frequency...

29:58.981 --> 30:00.214
CB radio?

30:00.216 --> 30:03.417
Y-You trying to communicate
with someone?

30:03.419 --> 30:05.553
Who?

30:05.555 --> 30:07.688
Search your feelings,
Sam.

30:08.970 --> 30:11.570
No. No.
Lucifer's dead.

30:11.572 --> 30:14.006
- He's in the Empty.
- Yeah, and he's awake...

30:15.343 --> 30:18.110
...and with the help of
your little prophet friend,

30:18.112 --> 30:19.879
I was able to have a convo
with him,

30:19.881 --> 30:23.816
and he told me
how to bring him back.

30:23.818 --> 30:25.484
It won't be easy.

30:25.486 --> 30:27.019
You'll have to
prove yourself.

30:27.021 --> 30:28.688
The Winchesters
will be a problem.

30:28.690 --> 30:31.090
But you can use that,
twist it...

30:31.092 --> 30:32.825
find a way to get to my son.

30:32.827 --> 30:36.028
His blood.
You need his blood.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.431
Come on, Sam.
Nobody stays dead anymore.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.433
You know that.

30:40.435 --> 30:45.738
All you need is a little
elbow grease, some new friends.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.107
Where you think
I got that angel grace?

30:49.410 --> 30:52.545
Who do you think hid me
after I carved up that cop?

30:53.915 --> 30:55.247
Demons. Yeah.

30:55.249 --> 30:57.683
They want Lucifer back
almost as much as me.

30:57.685 --> 30:59.218
So, thanks.

31:01.522 --> 31:04.223
Dean!

32:04.452 --> 32:06.685
Lucifer's
perfect vessel.

32:06.687 --> 32:09.321
Not so perfect now,
are ya?

32:22.837 --> 32:24.170
Come on, Sam.

32:24.172 --> 32:25.971
Hit play, baby.

32:25.973 --> 32:28.574
Come on, Sam!

32:53.201 --> 32:55.167
Come on!

33:03.211 --> 33:05.144
Dean!

33:12.220 --> 33:13.652
Dean.

33:13.654 --> 33:14.954
Sam?

33:14.956 --> 33:17.756
Hey, hey, hey.
Sammy. Yo--

33:30.401 --> 33:31.633
Hey!

33:31.635 --> 33:33.869
Nick -- he's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

33:33.871 --> 33:35.804
- How?
- <i>I don't know!</i>

33:35.806 --> 33:37.206
I don't know.
He played us.

33:37.208 --> 33:40.275
- Oh, God. Help me.
- Hey! Hey!

33:41.479 --> 33:42.744
We have to stop him.

33:42.746 --> 33:44.346
Thanks.

33:46.417 --> 33:48.584
Yeah, well, we don't
even where he is, okay?

33:48.586 --> 33:50.452
And he hurt Sam.
He got him in the head.

33:50.454 --> 33:51.987
I don't even
want to move him.

33:51.989 --> 33:54.123
<i>We called an ambulance,</i>
<i>but they said 20 minutes.</i>

33:54.125 --> 33:56.024
It's not good, Mom.
It's really bad.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.894
We're on our way.

34:46.443 --> 34:48.110
What is it?

34:48.112 --> 34:51.746
I feel -- It feels
like my blood's burning.

34:53.851 --> 34:55.384
He has it.

34:55.386 --> 34:57.953
I have a soul!

35:01.258 --> 35:04.159
This was about you,
Jack.

35:04.161 --> 35:05.928
All of it.

35:07.398 --> 35:08.597
He needed your blood.

35:08.599 --> 35:11.466
I feel it.
I can feel him.

35:11.468 --> 35:15.370
<i>...qui dormiunt,</i>
<i>ad dominum formosum.</i>

35:15.372 --> 35:20.209
<i>Nexus noster,</i>
<i>restitutus est.</i>

35:20.211 --> 35:22.211
Where? Where is he?

35:22.213 --> 35:27.216
I think I know -- I think
I-I can get us to him.

35:27.218 --> 35:30.953
But I need
to use my powers.

35:30.955 --> 35:33.722
Do it.

35:33.724 --> 35:39.561
<i>Surgas ex abysso,</i>
<i>in lumine exsistas!</i>

35:55.279 --> 35:56.812
Lucifer.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.883
I'm here.

36:01.885 --> 36:04.453
I'm ready.

36:04.455 --> 36:06.688
Your vessel.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.724
Your perfect vessel.

36:08.726 --> 36:10.626
Make me strong again.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.194
Make me you.

36:29.346 --> 36:30.879
No!

36:35.286 --> 36:37.619
No, wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

36:37.621 --> 36:40.088
What did you do?!

36:43.327 --> 36:45.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:46.130 --> 36:47.729
Jack!

36:47.731 --> 36:50.866
Aah!
Jack!

36:50.868 --> 36:54.303
What are you doing?!

36:54.305 --> 36:55.537
Stop it!

36:59.943 --> 37:01.743
Stop it!

37:04.581 --> 37:07.516
Stop! Stop!

37:07.518 --> 37:09.184
Jack, stop it!

37:24.633 --> 37:26.668
Hey. Hey. Come on.
Stay with me now.

37:26.669 --> 37:28.168
We're just gonna play
a little game.

37:28.170 --> 37:29.970
We're gonna count, okay?
We're gonna count.

37:29.972 --> 37:32.072
Count with me. One...

37:32.074 --> 37:33.240
two...

37:33.242 --> 37:34.842
- Two.
- Yeah, there you go.

37:34.844 --> 37:36.510
...three.

37:36.512 --> 37:38.045
Come on. Come on.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.314
You -- You always put --
You always put me first.

37:40.316 --> 37:42.783
No, no. Shh, shh.
Come on. Come on, man.

37:42.785 --> 37:46.587
Your whole life...

37:46.589 --> 37:48.022
Okay. All right.

37:48.024 --> 37:51.025
All right. Come on. Come on.
Just count with me.

37:51.027 --> 37:54.061
Sammy. Hey! Sam!

38:03.305 --> 38:05.305
Mary?

38:08.878 --> 38:11.245
I had to.

38:14.650 --> 38:16.250
Uh...

38:16.252 --> 38:19.553
Sam -- Uh, he's hurt.

38:19.555 --> 38:21.221
Help him.

38:29.398 --> 38:31.398
Dean?

38:31.400 --> 38:32.433
Sam.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.816
Nick. Where's Nick?

38:48.818 --> 38:51.953
I stopped him.
It's over.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.822
What about Mom?

38:54.824 --> 38:57.158
She's fine.

39:00.864 --> 39:03.898
Everything's
gonna be fine.

39:20.016 --> 39:22.216
I healed Sam.

39:22.218 --> 39:24.919
Everything's
gonna be okay.

39:26.389 --> 39:29.190
Good.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.425
That's good.

39:31.427 --> 39:34.262
Mary.

39:34.264 --> 39:35.930
Nick...

39:35.932 --> 39:39.367
he was a bad person,
a killer.

39:39.369 --> 39:41.035
I had to stop him.

39:43.540 --> 39:46.107
Not like that.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.443
He deserved it.

39:53.383 --> 39:55.249
Take me home, Jack.

39:55.251 --> 39:57.018
I-I will.

39:57.020 --> 40:01.055
I will. I-I just...

40:01.057 --> 40:04.125
Tell me it's okay.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.964
It's not.

40:11.734 --> 40:13.134
<i>You're</i> not.

40:13.136 --> 40:15.002
You...

40:15.004 --> 40:18.372
It's not your fault,

40:18.374 --> 40:21.275
but the Jack I know

40:21.277 --> 40:23.678
would never
have done that.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.048
You -- You're...

40:27.050 --> 40:28.616
Something's wrong.

40:28.618 --> 40:31.285
No, I'm not.
<i>You're</i> wrong.

40:31.287 --> 40:34.055
Sweetheart.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.523
You know I'm not.

40:35.525 --> 40:38.492
You know, Sam and Dean,
they were grateful.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.598
If Sam and Dean
saw what you did,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.233
they would be
as worried as I am.

40:54.143 --> 40:56.844
Are you gonna tell them?

40:59.182 --> 41:04.185
You need help,
we'll help you.

41:04.187 --> 41:05.386
We're your family.

41:05.388 --> 41:07.154
You can't.

41:08.958 --> 41:10.558
We care about you, Jack.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.527
- No, just leave me alone.
- Jack.

41:13.529 --> 41:14.762
Leave me alone.
Please, just --

41:14.764 --> 41:17.632
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

41:17.634 --> 41:18.866
- Please.
- Leave me alone.

41:18.868 --> 41:20.901
Leave me alone.

41:20.903 --> 41:22.036
What's happening?

41:22.038 --> 41:24.205
- Leave me alone!
- What's going on?

41:24.207 --> 41:26.641
- Leave me alone!
- Jack, just...

41:26.643 --> 41:28.242
Listen!

41:28.244 --> 41:30.578
Jack? Please!

41:30.580 --> 41:33.414
Listen to me!
Leave me alone!

41:36.886 --> 41:38.853
