00:50.500 --> 00:52.540
They're gaining on us!

00:54.210 --> 00:55.620
What are these things?

00:55.620 --> 00:58.000
Don't worry,
it's just a pack
of Slayer Wolves.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.500
Come on! This way!

01:05.880 --> 01:08.460
Dead end!
We're goners!

01:08.460 --> 01:10.460
Aw, please, wolves,
don't eat me!

01:10.460 --> 01:12.170
I'm so chewy!

01:12.170 --> 01:15.250
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm probably moist
and delicious.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.750
It's not a dead end, Lance.
It's just got good acoustics.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.210
Ah, ha!
That was incredible, Eugene!

01:35.210 --> 01:37.960
Oh, man, Eugene's back
and better than ever!

01:37.960 --> 01:40.250
Yeah!
You're the king of the wild!

01:40.250 --> 01:42.620
All right, everybody,
let's hit the road.

01:47.420 --> 01:50.080
Eh, anybody who's spent time
in the woods knows

01:50.080 --> 01:52.960
that Slayer Wolves have
extremely sensitive hearing.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.210
See that teamwork?
I distract them by pretending
to cry while you chase 'em off.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.710
Thank you!

01:59.710 --> 02:02.460
I just did what had to be done.
Now come on, I'll show you

02:02.460 --> 02:04.420
how to extract drinking water
from a tree trunk!

02:06.880 --> 02:10.419
Okay, so the black rocks
have led us to a swamp.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.460
But on the bright side...

02:12.460 --> 02:14.540
I was hoping someone
would finish that sentence

02:14.540 --> 02:15.790
for me, this place is terrible.

02:22.540 --> 02:25.330
Uh, I don't think
you wanna drink that, Shorty.

02:25.330 --> 02:27.380
Ah, you know what they say:

02:27.380 --> 02:31.420
One man's swamp water
is another man's
"I'll drink it!"

02:31.420 --> 02:36.000
So, "king of the wild",
any suggestions on how
to cross this thing?

02:43.960 --> 02:44.960
Eugene!

02:48.170 --> 02:50.170
Looks like it's too deep! Hah!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.790
So, I think we're going
to have to backtrack
to get through this.

02:52.790 --> 02:55.330
It'll add a day to our journey,
but it's the only way.

02:55.330 --> 02:59.790
I had no idea people from Corona
were such... quitters.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.540
You know, I always say,

03:07.540 --> 03:10.880
if you can't go through
something, go over it.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.330
Wow!
I guess chivalry's not dead!

03:14.330 --> 03:16.830
I told you I'd be around
if trouble came your way.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.000
And, well, here I am.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.540
Your new guide.

03:20.540 --> 03:23.420
Yeah, you were a real help
with those Slayer Wolves
back there.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.710
You be quiet.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.170
Rapunzel, we talked
about this.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.500
I don't trust this woman.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.540
She keeps popping up
out of nowhere, and I
don't like it.

03:32.540 --> 03:35.620
Yes.
Yes, yes, I second that,
plus, we don't need her.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.620
Another person will just
slow us down, particularly
with all h--

03:38.620 --> 03:41.620
Oh, I don't know,
you're gonna need her.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.000
She's the only one
who can get you through

03:44.000 --> 03:47.710
the deadly Forest of No Return.

03:49.750 --> 03:55.250
Few have made it
to the other side of the forest
alive, and I'm one of them.

03:55.250 --> 03:59.880
The first time I crossed,
I had nothing but a dagger
and a handful of nuts.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.790
And I had bronchitis.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.750
You're amazing!

04:03.750 --> 04:05.120
I know.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.540
So, lookie here, Adira,
I appreciate the bridge assist,

04:10.540 --> 04:12.620
but I'm pretty sure I can
lead us through a forest--

04:12.620 --> 04:15.670
-Forest of No--
-Yes, I'm familiar
with its name, thank you.

04:15.670 --> 04:19.670
Wait! Eugene, listen,

04:19.670 --> 04:23.290
I know you grew up
in the wilderness, and I have
complete faith in you,

04:23.290 --> 04:27.000
I really do.
But can it hurt anything
to have another expert along?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.880
Oh, goodie!
Another expert!

04:30.920 --> 04:32.420
Fine.

04:32.420 --> 04:35.620
Excellent.
You've made the only decision
there is.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.620
The right one.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.500
This doesn't
change anything, Eugene.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.750
You are still the go-to guy
out here.

04:46.290 --> 04:47.620
That way!

04:47.620 --> 04:49.580
Mmmm...

04:51.710 --> 04:54.790
I would've cut these logs
so much smoother.

04:54.790 --> 04:55.920
Look at that
shoddy craftsmanship.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.580
That is one scary tree.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.920
Reminds me of my Uncle Mert.
He, too, was a scary tree.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.710
Relax, Shorty,
there's nothing to be
afraid of.

05:20.710 --> 05:23.290
This swamp is just like
any other swamp.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.830
Anyone else hear
a buzzing noise?

05:24.830 --> 05:26.790
I hear a buzzing noise.

05:34.580 --> 05:37.380
Oh! Thank you, Adira.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.290
All right, we all saw
the creepy bug, nothing
to write home about.

05:40.290 --> 05:41.750
Huh?
Let's move on.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.960
Whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
What's going on?

05:43.960 --> 05:46.750
The Forest of No Return
is in perpetual motion

05:46.750 --> 05:48.830
and changes without warning.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.790
Luckily I procured
this special map
many years ago.

05:51.790 --> 05:55.830
It's the key to traversing
the woods... safely.

05:55.830 --> 06:00.120
Uhh, thanks, but I happen to be
a really good navigator.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.580
And uh, I've got
all the directions I need,
right here.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.500
Suit yourself.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.830
Very well, Adira.
Your passive aggression
is noted

06:07.830 --> 06:09.750
and respectfully disregarded.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.710
Onward, Max!

06:18.290 --> 06:20.750
Come on, Max,
I'm trying to prove
a point here!

06:32.830 --> 06:35.120
Although I was surrounded
by stunning scenery,

06:35.120 --> 06:37.500
I knew not to mistake
this beauty

06:37.500 --> 06:41.960
for what it truly was...
pure evil.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.580
Uh-huh, that's right.

06:43.580 --> 06:46.170
The Drexis
are the deadliest creatures

06:46.170 --> 06:47.880
within the Forest of No Return.

06:47.880 --> 06:52.210
Their wingspan stretches
over 20 feet.

06:52.210 --> 06:57.330
And each
of their fangs are the size
of a chubby toddler.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.790
Wow, that is some
powerful imagery there, Adira.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.290
Fictional, but powerful.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.830
And I was with you, but once
you got to the spider-bats,

07:03.830 --> 07:05.790
you totally snapped
my suspension of disbelief.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.830
They're called the Drexis,
weren't you listenin'?

07:07.830 --> 07:10.210
Who cares what they're called?

07:10.210 --> 07:11.880
Anyone? Show of hands?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.330
Would you
put your hand down, Lance?

07:13.330 --> 07:16.460
Look, my point is,
we are almost out
of this fore--

07:16.460 --> 07:18.330
Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.380
That cannot be the same sign.

07:20.380 --> 07:23.620
Uncle Mert!
I saw a tree that looks
just like you.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.960
We just went in a big circle.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.920
No... wait, it's not--
we should be out
of this forest.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.290
-Of No--
-I know what it's called!

07:32.290 --> 07:33.620
Return.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.670
I really don't like you.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.880
Okay, so I haven't technically
gotten us anywhere,

07:41.880 --> 07:43.830
and I know what you're thinking,

07:43.830 --> 07:44.750
but it is not my fault.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.080
Not your fault?
You led us in a circle,

07:47.080 --> 07:49.040
"really good navigator."

07:49.040 --> 07:52.710
In Eugene's defense,
it was a really good circle.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.750
Ugh! We're never
getting out of here.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.920
We will if we use the map,
Short Hair.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.540
What did you call me?

07:58.540 --> 08:01.500
I find referring to people
by a defining characteristic

08:01.500 --> 08:03.790
is more time-efficient
than learning their names.

08:03.790 --> 08:06.540
Hence, Short Hair.

08:06.540 --> 08:07.830
-Earrings.
-Mmm.

08:07.830 --> 08:09.960
-Soiled Gnome.
-Seems accurate.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.080
-And Hook Foot.
-Ohh, that's just
my actual name.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.790
What's Eugene's?

08:16.790 --> 08:17.830
Fish Skin.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.710
- Wait a minute, what?
Fish Skin?

08:19.710 --> 08:21.380
Fish Skin?
Hoo-hoo!

08:21.380 --> 08:22.960
Well, I think
the daily application

08:22.960 --> 08:24.120
of 16 assorted lotions,

08:24.120 --> 08:26.670
creams and exfoliants,
would beg to differ!

08:26.670 --> 08:29.710
Eugene, hmm, maybe
you should stop talking

08:29.710 --> 08:33.039
about your morning routine
and just take Adira's map.

08:33.039 --> 08:36.000
Fine! I will take
the precious map.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.789
Wise choice, Fish Skin.

08:37.789 --> 08:40.919
You must follow its instructions
to the letter.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.039
Without its guidance,
finding the exit to the forest

08:44.039 --> 08:47.040
would be like finding fur
on a rattlesnake.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.880
Aw, that would be kind
of adorable.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.500
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, maps are pictures
of the ground,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.330
and that's sometimes useful.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.880
You know
what else is useful?
Common sense.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.040
And common sense says
we need to take
this other road!

09:01.040 --> 09:05.670
Everyone back in the caravan,
and where is the caravan?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.460
Both of you, back up!

09:07.460 --> 09:10.750
That's a land pit.
They're scattered
all over the forest.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.830
The horses and the camper
are likely in another section
of the woods now.

09:13.830 --> 09:15.920
All right, all right,
listen up, everyone.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.380
There's no reason to be scared.

09:17.380 --> 09:22.040
We're gonna find Max
and Fidella, and get the heck
outta this place in no time.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.120
Follow my lead.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.330
Cheater.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.170
Everyone!
Over here!

10:13.790 --> 10:14.880
Woo-hoo!

10:17.960 --> 10:19.120
Rapunzel!

10:19.120 --> 10:21.960
The secret to escaping
is to relax.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.710
Reacting only tightens
their grip.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.250
- All right, gang.
- Time to fuel up.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.000
Why! Won't! These!
Stupid! Vines! Cut!

10:36.000 --> 10:38.120
Uhh, how much longer, Eugene?

10:38.120 --> 10:41.120
Don't think of it as longer,
think of it as better.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.420
Just relax, Rapunzel.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.120
Would you please
avoid relaxing?

10:45.120 --> 10:47.170
I'm really tryin'
to save face here.

10:47.170 --> 10:50.210
Stupid Adira
and her relaxing vines!

10:53.330 --> 10:56.540
Just when I thought
it wasn't possible
to like you more,

10:56.540 --> 11:00.170
you go and make
this delectable
blackberry salad!

11:00.170 --> 11:02.080
Mmm! Mmm.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.620
The roasted trout
is fantastic!

11:04.620 --> 11:07.580
And Pascal loves
his spiced fly medley.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.250
Yeah, well, the cobbler's salty.
I'm gonna go extract

11:12.250 --> 11:13.920
some drinking water
from that tree over there.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.000
That's damaging to the tree,
Fish Skin.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.420
Try cutting a notch
in one of those

11:18.420 --> 11:20.210
water-bearing vines instead.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.210
This is the best Gouda
I've ever had!

11:22.210 --> 11:24.420
It's-- it's a taste explosion!

11:24.420 --> 11:26.330
You know, I always say...

11:26.330 --> 11:28.710
...never leave home
without hard cheese.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.120
Oh, and uh, by the way,

11:33.120 --> 11:34.460
watch out
for the pup-shrooms!

11:34.460 --> 11:36.170
Aww!
Are you kidding me?

11:41.580 --> 11:46.210
Eugene, I think it's time
that you give Adira a chance.

11:46.210 --> 11:47.880
She's done this before.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.210
She can lead us out of here.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.670
It's not your fault
you took the wrong way

11:52.670 --> 11:55.000
and lost the camper.
Everyone still thinks--

11:55.000 --> 11:56.620
We'd be lost
without you, Adira!

11:56.620 --> 11:58.120
You're the king of the wild!

11:58.120 --> 11:59.460
What aren't you good at?

11:59.460 --> 12:01.290
Maybe somebody
should take some notes!

12:01.290 --> 12:03.000
Eugene!
You got a pad on you?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.920
Ah... I'll handle this.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.620
-Hey, my Gouda!
-Break's over, everybody.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.380
We've got a forest to conquer.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.040
Ohh!
Look what I can see from here!

12:40.040 --> 12:41.500
It's the edge of the forest!

12:41.500 --> 12:43.580
We made it!
You know something,
it's almost

12:43.580 --> 12:46.750
like we didn't need
this map, or some
random stranger.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.250
Whoa-ahh!

12:48.250 --> 12:50.120
Ha, okay,
perfect landing.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.580
Ten out of ten.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.420
Now, I don't wanna brag--
scratch that, I want to brag--

12:54.420 --> 12:58.920
who led us outta here?
Buckle in, because this
is a lotta syllables, kids:

12:58.920 --> 13:01.170
Eugene Fitzherbert, Esquire,

13:01.170 --> 13:04.830
navigator
extraordinaire--

13:06.580 --> 13:07.580
Oh, boy.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.830
Those are the Silver Geysers.

13:11.830 --> 13:14.790
They're lava hot,
and emit toxic gases.

13:14.790 --> 13:17.170
Looks like I got
some competition.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.790
The map is instructing us
to run through them.

13:19.790 --> 13:23.170
It's possible,
if we time it right.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.540
Are you kidding me?

13:24.540 --> 13:26.290
You want us
to run through there?

13:26.290 --> 13:28.210
A field of piping hot
fire water?

13:28.210 --> 13:29.210
Yeah, we're not doin' that.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.880
We could be swallowed
by a land pit at any moment.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.080
You have a better idea?

13:43.120 --> 13:44.710
I gotta be honest,
I don't like the way

13:44.710 --> 13:46.460
you're lookin' at me right now.

13:49.170 --> 13:51.580
All right, Muscles?
Hold onto this.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.620
Madame Ice Demon,
grab onto him.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.040
Let's go with somethin' else.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.750
Bearded Raisin,
hold onto her.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.170
Sunshine!
Hop aboard, darlin'.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.250
I can do nicknames, too.
And it's like you said,

14:01.250 --> 14:04.040
if you can't go through
something, go over it.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.750
Right, Adira?

14:05.750 --> 14:07.580
You're making
a mistake, Fish Skin.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.540
Maybe we should, uh
listen to her, Eugene?

14:12.540 --> 14:15.170
Guys, she's literally
asking you

14:15.170 --> 14:17.420
to run through
blazing hot explosions!

14:17.420 --> 14:19.290
Look, I may have
underestimated these woods,

14:19.290 --> 14:21.330
and made a few mistakes
along the way,

14:21.330 --> 14:24.710
but those mistakes were really
the forest's fault, not mine.

14:24.710 --> 14:28.380
So who are you gonna trust?
Me, your friend who's
gotten you this far,

14:28.380 --> 14:32.170
and has always had your back,
or hmm?

14:32.170 --> 14:36.170
I hate to say it,
but I think I'm gonna go
with Adira on this one.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.460
Me too.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.080
No!
I know best!

14:45.170 --> 14:47.250
Ooh! Whoa!

14:47.250 --> 14:49.540
Aw, no--
Oh, come on.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.620
I cannot believe this!

14:51.620 --> 14:53.420
How are we back here?

14:53.420 --> 14:54.670
Hey, look, it's...

14:54.670 --> 14:57.210
Uncle Mert! We know.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.620
Who's Uncle Mert?

14:58.620 --> 14:59.920
It gets worse.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.790
The path we came in on.
It's not there anymore!

15:04.540 --> 15:07.290
We're never gonna escape,
and it's all your fault, Eugene.

15:07.290 --> 15:10.250
You're not the king of the wild.
You're a disaster!

15:10.250 --> 15:12.330
You should've just
given the map back to Adira.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.380
-You can't read it!
-Who could?
It's a joke!

15:15.380 --> 15:16.830
This doesn't make any sense.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.420
I saw the exit.
You saw the exit.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.500
There was an exit!
Now what do we d-- oh!

15:21.500 --> 15:22.750
Aah! Landpit!

15:22.750 --> 15:26.080
Stupid landpits!

15:26.080 --> 15:28.210
Wait!

15:28.210 --> 15:29.920
Where'd everyone go?

15:31.380 --> 15:34.080
Rapunzel! Cass!

15:34.080 --> 15:35.620
Lance! Anybody!

15:35.620 --> 15:38.710
Huh!
All right, how does Adira
read this stupid thing?

15:40.250 --> 15:44.920
I think it's pointing me
toward a black blobby thing?

15:46.670 --> 15:47.960
Yep, there it is.

15:50.290 --> 15:53.500
No, not a blobby thing.
A magical wall of black fire.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
Ha-- That was my next guess.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.420
Oh, come on!
This can't be right, can it?

16:03.420 --> 16:06.460
I have to walk through a wall
of magical black fire?

16:06.460 --> 16:07.750
This is crazy!

16:07.750 --> 16:10.790
Okay, this map
had better be right.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.210
Wowzas!

16:13.290 --> 16:15.290
Whoa--

16:15.290 --> 16:16.500
Ohh!

16:18.120 --> 16:19.500
Ow!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.080
Adira!

16:22.080 --> 16:23.670
Ha-ha-- This actually worked!

16:23.670 --> 16:24.830
Have you seen the others?

16:24.830 --> 16:26.250
Not since you jumped
across the clearing

16:26.250 --> 16:27.750
like a delirious madman.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.500
We've gotta find them
before nightfall.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.670
Mm-hm.
So what's your plan?

16:31.670 --> 16:35.540
My plan is for you
to take the lead.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.290
Please help me find my friends.

16:40.750 --> 16:44.460
I know exactly where we are,
but I'm not sure
about the others.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.250
The map can only point
its user to the exit.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.330
Well, maybe they've made it out!
Come on!

16:49.330 --> 16:53.380
I wish I could say they have,
but... you need the map
or me to get to the exit,

16:53.380 --> 16:58.460
and as you can see,
both of those things
are right here.

16:58.460 --> 17:02.250
Adira, I'm sorry for the mess
I've gotten us into.

17:02.250 --> 17:06.119
It's just-- Before I met
Rapunzel, being an adventurous,
devil-may-care rogue

17:06.119 --> 17:08.000
was the one definite
in my life.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.710
It just felt nice
to be in charge
like that again.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.210
Hey!

17:12.210 --> 17:15.540
Pup-shroom.

17:15.540 --> 17:21.000
- But... I guess I'm not
that guy anymore.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.290
You're right.
You're not who
you used to be.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.380
As you may be aware,
I've been observing
you and your friends.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.960
And it's clear that
because of the princess,

17:29.960 --> 17:33.460
you've become much more
than just a swashbuckler.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.830
You're also a friend.

17:35.830 --> 17:39.420
You bring laughter...
and warmth.

17:39.420 --> 17:42.330
You're the fish skin
that holds this group together.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.040
Hold up...
did you just say--

17:44.040 --> 17:46.710
It's the optimum compound
for making glue.

17:46.710 --> 17:49.380
I used it to repair the soles
of these boots.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.420
Not too bad, huh?

17:50.420 --> 17:52.500
Oh! Fish Skin
is a compliment?

17:52.500 --> 17:53.960
Uh... sure.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.420
Well, we can't just give up.
Come on, Adira,

17:56.420 --> 17:59.040
I-- I don't care if we have
to turn this forest inside out,

17:59.040 --> 18:01.120
we're gonna find my friends.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.750
Wait!
Inside out!

18:03.750 --> 18:06.420
That's it!
If I'm correct,
the sections of this forest

18:06.420 --> 18:09.830
are moving
from the inside out!

18:09.830 --> 18:11.540
A-ha!
I'm correct!

18:11.540 --> 18:14.790
We'll be able to find
your friends right... here.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.170
- What's wrong?
- Where are they?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.000
These are the prettiest flowers
I've ever seen.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.580
They're like medicine
for my soul.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.420
They're beauti-- wait.

18:29.420 --> 18:34.330
Don't mistake the beauty
for what it truly is,
pure evil.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.460
Guys, I don't think
these are flowers!

18:40.790 --> 18:43.670
Spiders!
Why does it always
have to be spiders?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.290
No, no, no, no, no!

18:48.790 --> 18:50.460
It's the Drexis!

18:50.460 --> 18:52.460
Ohh! Whoo!

18:53.580 --> 18:54.710
Rapunzel! Run!

19:20.960 --> 19:24.750
Adira was right.
Their fangs are as big
as chubby toddlers.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.120
Why? Why?

19:26.120 --> 19:29.750
I'm not gonna be eaten
by some stupid flower-spider-
bat-thing!

19:29.750 --> 19:33.380
I leave you guys alone
for five minutes, and you
get spun into a cocoon

19:33.380 --> 19:35.960
by giant spider-bats
pretending to be flowers.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.080
Pfft, typical.

19:39.210 --> 19:40.670
This isn't looking good.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.250
There's still too many of them!
What do we do, Eugene?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.620
I think that's a question
for Adira!

19:50.620 --> 19:53.500
Uh, not a great time
to discover humility, Fish Skin!

19:53.500 --> 19:54.620
Don't worry.
That's a compliment.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.330
The land pits!

20:07.330 --> 20:09.210
We've gotta jump
in that hole!

20:09.210 --> 20:10.710
Jump in a hole?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.960
The same kinda hole
that led us to his clusterjam?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.460
Do what she says, Hook Foot!

20:14.460 --> 20:17.040
Like I have a choice!
I'm a moth-man over here!

20:18.290 --> 20:20.620
Real men love strong women.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.420
What are you waitin' for?

20:33.420 --> 20:34.960
Jump in the hole!

20:48.290 --> 20:51.620
I've never been so glad
to see those black rocks.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.710
I'm so happy
I could kiss someone!

20:54.710 --> 20:55.830
Ehhh, never mind.

20:55.830 --> 20:58.620
Well, this is where I leave you.

20:58.620 --> 21:01.620
-Adira, thank you.
For ev--
-Everything?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.120
I know, I'm amazing.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.170
Once again, I have conquered
the Forest of No Return,

21:06.170 --> 21:09.880
and singlehandedly pulled you
out of a dire strait.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.710
And I still have bronchitis.

21:11.710 --> 21:16.170
Which, I didn't even tell you
about, because, let's face it,
I'm a champion.

21:16.170 --> 21:19.670
Oh!
Champion of my heart.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.580
I hate to admit it,
but she's growin' on me.

21:22.580 --> 21:23.580
Well, that's no surprise.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.670
Look how long it took me
to win you over.

21:25.670 --> 21:29.170
-Well...
-Hey, look!
Someone put a tent on wheels!

21:29.170 --> 21:30.830
It's our caravan!

21:30.830 --> 21:33.000
The land must have shifted it
over here!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.380
Shorty!
You have excellent vision.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.670
Because I eat a lot
of vitamin butter.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.580
You know, for the record,

21:40.580 --> 21:42.670
I'm pretty confident I could've
gotten us out of there,

21:42.670 --> 21:46.330
eventually,
but I figured, let Adira
have her moment in the sun,

21:46.330 --> 21:48.500
you know?
Clearly, she's got
attention issues,

21:48.500 --> 21:50.210
and I thought I'd
throw her a bone.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.960
That was very nice
of you, Eugene.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.420
Uh, Eugene?
That's the sunset
ahead of us?

21:56.420 --> 21:58.000
Yeah? And?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.040
We're supposed to be
heading east.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.580
Oh, come on!

22:01.580 --> 22:03.000
Way to go, Fish Skin.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.040
Heh-heh, that's
a compliment.
