5:00. Why?

09:54.550 --> 09:55.856
What is all this?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.771
It's the reason I
needed more paper.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.164
Is the man in question
a current or former patient?

10:00.208 --> 10:01.470
Current.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.473
Are these
Dr. Reed's patient files?

10:04.516 --> 10:06.562
They are.
Oh.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
So I guess her partner
changed his mind

10:08.651 --> 10:10.131
about sharing information.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.001
He did not.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.786
Well, there's no way

10:12.829 --> 10:15.223
the police could've gotten
a court order this quickly.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.529
Where did these come from?

10:17.573 --> 10:19.880
That backup hard drive.
I stole it

10:19.923 --> 10:22.578
from Dr. Reed's
office. I know.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.188
It's almost one tree's worth
of paper.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.537
But I worried

10:25.581 --> 10:26.626
that reading it
on a computer

10:26.669 --> 10:27.452
might trigger another headache.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.153
Do you know how illegal it is
for us to have this stuff?

10:32.196 --> 10:34.024
Less illegal than stabbing
a woman to death.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.635
The primary reason

10:35.678 --> 10:37.375
that psychiatric records
are kept confidential

10:37.419 --> 10:40.988
is that many self-described sane
people are judgmental idiots.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.164
I myself am not. For example,

10:43.207 --> 10:44.556
I fully support this man's quest

10:44.600 --> 10:46.471
to have sex
with as many shoes as possible.

10:48.691 --> 10:49.953
Tuesdays at 5:00
is downstairs.

10:54.436 --> 10:57.657
Does that hard drive contain all
of Dr. Reed's patient files?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.963
Like, everyone she's ever seen?

11:00.007 --> 11:02.792
You're wondering if it also
contains your files. It does.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.664
But out of respect
for your privacy,

11:04.707 --> 11:06.709
I neither opened
nor printed them.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.581
Oh. So, myprivacy you respect?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.235
Unlike Dr. Reed's
other patients,

11:11.279 --> 11:12.802
I know where you were
at the time of the murder.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.848
Alfonse Kapoor,

11:14.891 --> 11:16.632
on the other hand...

11:16.676 --> 11:19.461
Is that Mr. Tuesdays
at 5:00 p.m.? What does it say?

11:19.504 --> 11:21.506
Are you certain
you wish to know?

11:21.550 --> 11:24.031
I mean, you've given me
a great deal to think about.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.294
Doctor-patient confidentiality
exists for a reason.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.730
It could be that
even a stab-happy

11:27.774 --> 11:29.689
psychopath deserves
some sort of...

11:32.561 --> 11:34.824
So, according to this,
he's a partner

11:34.868 --> 11:38.045
at an accounting firm called
Foster & Place.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.481
He was required
to see Dr. Reed

11:39.524 --> 11:42.266
after he bit a colleague
who argued with him.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.529
The doctor thought
he had rage issues.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.881
[rapping at door]

11:47.924 --> 11:49.534
HOLMES:
Mr. Kapoor?

11:49.578 --> 11:51.580
Hello. I'm Sherlock Holmes.
This is Joan Watson.

11:51.623 --> 11:54.322
We were hoping that
you might have a word with us.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.889
About?

11:55.932 --> 11:57.717
About Dr. Candace Reed.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.980
I-I...

12:00.023 --> 12:03.157
Do you want to close that?

12:03.200 --> 12:06.073
Seeing a psychiatrist is a sign
of weakness around here.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.423
If these guys smell blood,
they pounce.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.599
I hear some of them even bite.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.776
Did Sydney send you?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.386
Sydney?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.171
My boss.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.869
He's the only one
who knows I'm in therapy.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.219
Is there some problem?

12:23.481 --> 12:26.441
Dr. Reed was
murdered last night.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.487
What?

12:29.531 --> 12:31.315
We're consultants
with the NYPD.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.230
The medical examiner
thinks that she was killed

12:33.274 --> 12:35.798
between the hours of
8:00 and 10:00 p.m.

12:35.842 --> 12:40.629
Can you account for your
whereabouts during that time?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.458
Uh... Candace... is dead?

12:43.501 --> 12:46.026
Most of her patients referred
to her as "Dr. Reed."

12:46.069 --> 12:47.636
But, I mean, we understand

12:47.679 --> 12:50.726
you feel that you had
a special relationship?

12:52.075 --> 12:54.338
Mr. Kapoor?

12:54.382 --> 12:56.036
Could-could you tell us
where you were last night?

12:56.079 --> 12:58.603
No.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.084
Uh, I mean... I mean,
I was someplace. I just...

13:01.128 --> 13:02.956
[crying]

13:04.827 --> 13:07.787
Is... is she real-really dead?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.312
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm...

13:11.355 --> 13:13.140
Um, I'm having
a little trouble breathing.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.794
I'm just...
I'm just gonna get some air.

13:19.189 --> 13:22.889
If it's an act,
it's one of the best I've seen.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.239
He bit someone because
they argued with him.

13:25.282 --> 13:29.417
He's obviously capable
of violence when he's angry.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.637
Sometimes people prone
to rage-- they just black out.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.777
You know, it's understandable.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.648
You want to take a look
at your file.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.607
What?

13:45.650 --> 13:48.610
The one that contains Dr. Reed's
notes on your sessions together.

13:48.653 --> 13:52.919
You've been thinking
about it. I can tell.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.573
Yeah. You respected her
a great deal.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.575
She's gone, but her assessment
of you remains,

13:57.619 --> 14:00.013
so, it's natural
that you want to take a peek.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.276
I do not want to
look at my own file.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.539
I won't bring it up again,
but I'd be remiss

14:04.582 --> 14:05.627
if I didn't remind you that

14:05.670 --> 14:08.238
denial can be
a funny thing, you know?

14:08.282 --> 14:11.198
One never can tell
what it'll make one do.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.516
Mr. Kapoor, you awake?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.388
They told me
you spent the night here.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.346
Hmm?

14:29.390 --> 14:32.872
Guess we never did
finish our talk. [chuckles]

14:32.915 --> 14:35.657
No, I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.180
You surprised
me yesterday.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.313
If I'd have known
you were gonna do that...

14:39.356 --> 14:41.358
[groans softly]

14:41.402 --> 14:43.839
Candace...

14:44.840 --> 14:48.061
Dr. Reed helped me so much.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.977
I couldn't imagine going on
without her.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.675
Well, one more floor up,
and you wouldn't be.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.941
The second I jumped,

14:58.985 --> 15:01.161
I realized
that she had prepared me

15:01.204 --> 15:03.772
for every problem
I have in my life.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.168
Except falling three stories.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.213
Yeah. [chuckles]

15:10.257 --> 15:12.215
Well, you're gonna have
a few more days

15:12.259 --> 15:13.695
to firm up that perspective,
because,

15:13.738 --> 15:15.392
your doctors
are placing you

15:15.436 --> 15:16.916
on a danger-to-self hold.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.570
[sighs]

15:20.876 --> 15:22.922
You... you believe me now?

15:22.965 --> 15:26.621
That I didn't... kill her?

15:26.664 --> 15:29.102
I believed you
before you jumped.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.714
Look... what I did...

15:32.757 --> 15:34.237
People might think

15:34.281 --> 15:36.457
it was because
I really did hurt Dr. Reed.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.762
I don't want that.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.027
All I can tell you
about that night is...

15:41.070 --> 15:42.942
that I was at a meeting

15:42.985 --> 15:46.684
that is covered
by a non-disclosure agreement.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.731
And I know
how that must sound, but...

15:49.774 --> 15:53.039
if the details get out,

15:53.082 --> 15:57.565
a billion-dollar company's stock
goes in the toilet.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.262
I could get sued.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.482
My boss, Mr. Place,

16:01.525 --> 16:03.919
is supposed to be coming here
at 9:00 with some documents

16:03.963 --> 16:05.399
that he wants me to look over.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.835
Talk to him.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.403
He'll tell you
I'm telling the truth.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.927
So you attempted suicide
yesterday,

16:11.971 --> 16:15.713
and your boss
is bringing you work?

16:17.802 --> 16:20.675
[elevator bell dings]

16:20.718 --> 16:23.417
Mr. Place, I'm
Sherlock Holmes.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.766
I work with
the police.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.550
You might be aware

16:26.594 --> 16:28.857
I questioned your employee,
Mr. Kapoor, yesterday

16:28.900 --> 16:31.947
regarding the murder
of his therapist.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
Today, he told me
I should talk to you

16:34.036 --> 16:35.646
about where he was
two nights ago.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.953
You might not care that he tried

16:37.997 --> 16:40.042
to take his own life
yesterday, but I do,

16:40.086 --> 16:42.175
so would you do us both
the great favor

16:42.218 --> 16:44.829
of confirming
that he has an alibi?

16:44.873 --> 16:47.963
He was with me.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
Where?

16:50.052 --> 16:52.402
A meeting.

16:52.446 --> 16:57.016
We brokered a sit-down between
the CEO of a prominent company

16:57.059 --> 17:00.671
and a... and a certain
Antiguan bank.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.848
Antigua. Lovely. Known for
its barely-legal tax shelters.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.329
I won't be naming
the CEO or the bank,

17:06.373 --> 17:08.940
but I can arrange for the police
to see security video

17:08.983 --> 17:11.508
of Alfonse coming and going.

17:11.551 --> 17:14.816
Well, that would do the trick.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.560
I do care about him, you know.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.344
Alfonse.

17:21.387 --> 17:22.867
He's special.

17:22.911 --> 17:28.047
Goes through a tax code like
a fishmonger through a carp.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.312
I cared about Candace, too.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.010
You knew her?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.882
I'm the one
who referred Alfonse.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.536
So she was your
doctor, as well?

17:39.580 --> 17:42.626
No, no, no, no.
She was, uh, my tenant.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.803
I own the building
her offices are in.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.414
When she applied
for a lease,

17:47.457 --> 17:49.894
I found out
she had a great reputation

17:49.938 --> 17:51.200
and a long waiting list.

17:51.244 --> 17:54.160
So in exchange
for seeing Alfonse,

17:54.203 --> 17:56.988
I, uh, knocked
a few months off her rent.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.903
Very economical of you.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.167
Are you talking to her partner?

18:01.210 --> 18:03.647
Dr. Demopoulos?

18:03.691 --> 18:06.433
Perhaps. Why?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.044
Candace had to cover his rent
a few times last year,

18:09.088 --> 18:11.481
and other tenants complained

18:11.525 --> 18:15.006
that they could hear them
arguing sometimes, and...

18:15.050 --> 18:17.139
I don't know.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.186
Alfonse isn't your guy.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.275
Maybe Dr. Demopoulos is.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.889
[doorbell rings]

18:27.932 --> 18:29.891
Lin.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.241
You said to come by today,
remember?

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
The check for Dad's services.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.899
Oh, my God.
Right, right. Come in.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.466
Sherlock home?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.163
Uh, just me.

18:43.034 --> 18:43.992
New case?

18:44.035 --> 18:45.124
WATSON:
Yep.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.560
Who was she?

18:46.603 --> 18:48.518
WATSON:
My therapist.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.129
[laughs]
Right.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.263
You're kidding, right?

18:54.307 --> 18:56.787
I wish I was.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.137
Are you okay?

18:58.180 --> 19:01.096
I think I left my checkbook
in the kitchen...

19:01.140 --> 19:04.055
Joan. You just told me this
woman was your therapist.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.535
Are you okay?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.320
Uh, yeah.
I'm sorry,

19:07.363 --> 19:09.757
I-- you know I hadn't seen her
in a long ti-- I'm fine.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.714
You don't look fine.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.110
[sighs]

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
I think I made a mistake
this morning.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.679
I looked at something
I shouldn't have.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.681
Was it these pictures?

19:20.724 --> 19:25.076
I got access to her file
on me, and...

19:25.120 --> 19:27.949
I read something
that I wasn't expecting.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.995
What, did she think you were
a serial killer or something?

19:31.039 --> 19:34.869
She thought I would have been
a good mother.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.393
LIN: So, your therapist,
who you haven't seen in years,

19:37.437 --> 19:40.091
was killed, possibly by
one of her patients.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.964
And Sherlock thought the
quickest way to test that theory

19:43.007 --> 19:44.444
was to steal
a few thousand pages

19:44.487 --> 19:47.098
of extremely private
medical information.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.927
He did not steal the pages,
he stole her backup hard drive.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.407
But yeah.
This morning,

19:51.451 --> 19:54.062
you decided to look at
the notes she kept on you.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.716
[sighs] Listen, I know that
I shouldn't have done it.

19:55.759 --> 19:56.978
I just was curious, and I--

19:57.021 --> 19:58.849
Joanie, sweetie,
if they were notes on me,

19:58.893 --> 20:01.243
I would've read them
at the crime scene.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.419
I just think it's unfair.
I mean, she wrote those notes

20:03.463 --> 20:05.639
for herself, not for me.No.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.945
What do you mean, "no?"I mean you're not upset

20:07.989 --> 20:09.599
because you violated
some sacred trust

20:09.643 --> 20:11.601
between you and
your psychiatrist.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.037
You're upset because
someone you liked

20:13.081 --> 20:15.039
and respected and admired--

20:15.083 --> 20:17.651
someone whose job it was to help
people figure out their lives--

20:17.694 --> 20:19.261
thought you should be a mommy.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.611
Okay?What are you, my therapist now?

20:21.655 --> 20:26.137
Yes. For the duration of this
visit, I am your therapist.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.313
Would you like to lie down?

20:27.356 --> 20:29.053
"Patient has strong
maternal urges,

20:29.097 --> 20:31.708
"which she channels
into her job rather than

20:31.752 --> 20:34.972
facing her fears of actually
becoming a mother."

20:35.016 --> 20:37.061
You were a sober companion
back then, right?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.412
You were helping
addicts in recovery.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.674
But this woman never
told you she thought

20:40.717 --> 20:42.415
you were channeling urges?

20:42.458 --> 20:44.634
Therapists don't just come out
and tell you what they think.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.636
They want to help you
figure it out for yourself.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.072
It's more impactful that way.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.118
She never asked you
whether you wanted kids?

20:50.161 --> 20:52.729
She did, but that was in our
getting-to-know-you phase.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.122
I mean, it's not the reason
I started seeing her.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.776
Well, what did you tell her?

20:55.819 --> 20:58.300
I told her I hadn't
thought about it much.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.129
Was that because of Dad?What do you mean?

21:01.172 --> 21:04.219
Was Dad one of the reasons why
you didn't think about it much?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.525
You knew there was
a chance you could have

21:05.568 --> 21:08.005
a kid with schizophrenia.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.181
[sighs]
You are my therapist today.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.227
I worry about it whenever
I think about kids.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.359
How could we not?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.752
I mean, that was part of it,
yeah.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.102
But, also, I wasn't seeing
anyone back then.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.800
I mean, kids weren't really
on the horizon.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.671
I mean, that was five years ago.

21:21.715 --> 21:24.021
I mean, I don't know. I guess
just reading all that stuff

21:24.065 --> 21:25.762
made me think that I missed out
on something.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.373
[sighs][phone chimes]

21:27.416 --> 21:29.810
Oh, it's Sherlock.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.333
He wants me to meet him.[phone chimes]

21:31.377 --> 21:33.857
"Please bring a change
of clothes...

21:33.901 --> 21:35.772
and a light snack."

21:35.816 --> 21:39.080
Too bad Dr. Reed isn't here.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.300
She could see you
already have a kid.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.087
Too soon.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.132
Yeah, too soon.

HOLMES:
Dr. Demopoulos.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.709
Thank you for
meeting with us.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.320
Of course.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.322
I was glad to hear
from you, actually.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.802
I had some questions
about how to proceed

22:05.846 --> 22:09.197
once the police release
this place as a crime scene.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.938
How to proceed?

22:10.981 --> 22:13.114
With the, uh...

22:13.157 --> 22:15.682
cleaning.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.032
I assume there are services
for this sort of situation

22:18.075 --> 22:20.295
but I don't know how to go about
finding one.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.731
HOLMES: I can provide
you with several recipes

22:21.775 --> 22:23.385
for removing blood.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.344
Sadly, none of them can
remove the stain

22:25.387 --> 22:27.258
of a murder from one's soul.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.564
WATSON: Would you say
you and Dr. Reed

22:28.608 --> 22:30.261
had a good relationship?

22:30.305 --> 22:32.394
We were partners in a business.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.397
We had our ups and downs. Why?

22:35.441 --> 22:38.835
It's our understanding you were
prone to loud arguments.

22:38.879 --> 22:39.836
"Prone?"

22:39.880 --> 22:41.969
It means "in the habit of."

22:42.012 --> 22:43.492
I know what it means.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.016
Are you here because you think
I killed Candace?

22:46.060 --> 22:49.368
We know that she had to cover
your rent on multiple occasions.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.282
I was having cash flow problems.

22:51.326 --> 22:54.285
She carried me for a few months.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.200
Did it cause resentment? Yes.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.811
How could it not?

22:57.854 --> 22:59.203
You told us that you left here

22:59.247 --> 23:00.988
at 7:00 the night
she was killed.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.337
You had an appointment
in New Rochelle.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.252
Can you tell us who
you were meeting?

23:04.295 --> 23:06.472
Surely, you have access to her
bank records. You'll see

23:06.515 --> 23:09.518
that I paid her everything
I owed her, plus interest.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.346
You're evading, Doctor.
Who was your appointment with

23:11.390 --> 23:12.347
two nights ago?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.436
A patient.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.525
WATSON: Let me guess.
This is where you tell us

23:16.569 --> 23:18.440
that HIPAA privacy rules
"strictly forbid you"

23:18.484 --> 23:20.268
from giving us
that person's name.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.617
You know what?

23:21.661 --> 23:24.054
I don't have time for this.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.361
I have to see a patient
at Stuyvesant Memorial.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.929
HOLMES: That's interesting,
I just came from there.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.278
Are you meeting
with Alfonse Kapoor,

23:30.321 --> 23:31.671
formerly treated by Dr. Reed?

23:31.714 --> 23:33.499
I will talk to the patient

23:33.542 --> 23:35.457
I saw the night Candace
was killed.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.894
If he chooses to speak with you,
he'll be in touch.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.243
In the meantime,
I'll thank you

23:39.287 --> 23:42.377
to stay away
from me and my practice.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.335
Like you said, this is
an active crime scene.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.685
We'll thank youto leave.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.730
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

24:05.226 --> 24:06.836
Something in here
you wanted to look at?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.882
Something I wanted to return,
actually.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.231
You got what you wanted from it.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.407
Now no one will ever know
we had it.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.365
It was plugged in
under the desk.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.673
What did you think of
Demopoulos?

24:17.717 --> 24:20.284
I think he was afraid.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.199
But I would be, too,
if someone just accused me

24:22.243 --> 24:24.071
of killing my business partner.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.030
Let's just see if we hear
from this patient

24:27.074 --> 24:29.685
that he said
he was meeting with.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.649
Fluorescent lights gave me
a terrible headache yesterday.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.347
I'd like to avoid having
another one.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.093
Hmm.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.877
What?

24:47.921 --> 24:50.097
Well, you said you wanted
to put that back

24:50.140 --> 24:52.142
so that no one ever knew
we took it.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.667
But someone might already know.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.975
I think that that is
a listening device.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.720
If it's still
transmitting,

25:04.764 --> 25:06.287
and if someone's
listening,

25:06.330 --> 25:09.856
they will have heard
every word we said.

25:16.384 --> 25:17.603
WATSON:
Got it. I appreciate
you taking the time.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.736
Yes, and good luck
with the fish.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.217
Okay, so that was
Isaac Marlowe.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.566
The patient that
Dr. Demopoulos said

25:24.610 --> 25:25.828
he was with
on Monday night.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.438
Got fish problems,
has he?

25:27.482 --> 25:29.005
Among many,
many others.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.920
But he backed
the doctor's story.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.966
He was with him in New Rochelle
at the time of the murder.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.794
So Demopoulos
is not our guy.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.144
Then we are truly nowhere.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.841
What about that?

25:38.885 --> 25:41.452
Not much of a lead, I'm afraid.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.585
It's just a mic
with a transmitter.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.631
It's a common brand,
it's off the rack.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.458
And no fingerprints,
nor any other way

25:47.502 --> 25:52.551
to tell who planted it
in Dr. Reed's office.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.640
[sighs] In that case,
I wish we'd never found it.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.293
I'm gonna lose sleep knowing

25:56.337 --> 25:58.252
that someone might
have a recording

25:58.295 --> 26:00.341
of us talking about stealing
all this stuff.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.604
Well, I think
you can rest easy.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.258
We turned it off hours ago,

26:04.301 --> 26:06.260
and whoever planted it
was no longer listening

26:06.303 --> 26:09.568
or has a very good reason
for keeping mum.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.569
What makes you think so?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.179
Their deafening silence.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.963
The dust we found on
and around this device

26:14.007 --> 26:17.445
suggest it was in that
light fixture for months.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.360
That would mean that whoever
put it there...

26:19.403 --> 26:23.364
Probably has a recording
of Dr. Reed's murder.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.757
And yet no such recording

26:24.800 --> 26:27.281
has found its way
to the police.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.544
You think that's because
whoever planted the bug

26:29.588 --> 26:31.111
killed Dr. Reed?

26:31.154 --> 26:32.634
That's possible.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.506
Another reason is that it was
put there in the service

26:35.550 --> 26:37.900
of another crime
against Dr. Reed.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.120
And the perpetrator cannot share
their recording

26:40.163 --> 26:42.426
of her murder
without exposing themselves.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.560
Let's think practically.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.954
Why would somebody bug
a shrink's office?

26:47.997 --> 26:49.564
Either to eavesdrop on her...

26:49.608 --> 26:51.435
Or one of her patients.

26:54.917 --> 26:58.007
Yesterday, Dr. Reed's husband
said that some of her patients

26:58.051 --> 27:00.749
were going through divorces.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.795
Maybe one of them
had a spouse who

27:02.838 --> 27:04.579
wanted to listen for secrets

27:04.623 --> 27:06.233
about an affair,
or a hidden bank account.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.496
You're looking for these.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.280
I had the same thought earlier,

27:10.324 --> 27:13.675
but both divorce proceedings
were over months ago.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.503
So whatever Dr. Reed
knew about them,

27:15.546 --> 27:18.941
seems unlikely she'd be
killed over them now.

27:20.508 --> 27:24.338
Okay, um...
what about our jumper?

27:24.381 --> 27:26.862
Alfonse's alibi checked out.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.342
I'm not accusing him,

27:28.385 --> 27:29.822
I'm accusing the people
he works for.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.259
They could be behind
the bug and the murder.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.436
I mean... Remember, we talked
about these yesterday?

27:35.479 --> 27:38.004
There was stuff about his
"continuing efforts

27:38.047 --> 27:41.050
to win her over-- his obsessive
detailing of work minutiae."

27:41.094 --> 27:43.836
What if the minutiae was
sensitive financial information?

27:43.879 --> 27:47.274
Maybe he was trying
to win her over by sharing it.

27:47.317 --> 27:48.928
That could be dangerous.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.669
Foster & Place's clients include

27:50.712 --> 27:54.063
some of the darkest stars
of the corporate universe.

27:54.107 --> 27:57.545
The thing is, if they were
worried about him,

27:57.588 --> 27:59.329
why kill Dr. Reed?

27:59.373 --> 28:01.375
Wasn't Alfonse the real problem?

28:01.418 --> 28:04.595
That depends on the perspective
of the killer.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.213
Mr. Place.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.955
Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.652
Oh, don't thank me.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.568
I would have asked you
to make an appointment.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.440
Evidently my, uh, guard dog
has a soft spot for...

28:23.484 --> 28:27.270
What was it,
the... the British accent?

28:27.314 --> 28:30.578
Well, probably, but don't
be too hard on Gina.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.711
We told her we'd come to level
a murder accusation at you.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.582
I think she found that
a little unsettling.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.460
Do you care to back up
and explain yourself?

28:43.504 --> 28:45.854
No. Not particularly.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.683
I think you've heard quite
enough from us, recently.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.816
We'd like to hear what you have
to say for a change.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.774
What is that?
WATSON:
That's a listening device

28:52.818 --> 28:54.820
we found in
Dr. Reed's office.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.604
You own the building.

28:56.647 --> 28:57.736
It would have been easy for you

28:57.779 --> 28:58.954
to plant a bug like that.

28:58.998 --> 29:02.697
Why would I bug
Candace's office?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.438
Perhaps you were worried about
what Alfonse was telling her

29:04.481 --> 29:05.700
during those sessions.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.528
You didn't want her to act

29:07.571 --> 29:09.660
on any of the intelligence
that he was sharing with her.

29:09.704 --> 29:12.707
I mean, firms like this,
they can be touchy about that.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.840
Based on everything I've heard,

29:14.883 --> 29:16.755
a crazy person murdered Candace.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.409
I mean, she was...

29:19.453 --> 29:20.759
She was butchered.

29:20.802 --> 29:24.153
Things like that are
tragically easy to fake.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.068
All one needs to mimic
the actions

29:26.112 --> 29:27.591
of a violent psychopath

29:27.635 --> 29:29.637
is a willing sociopath.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.161
And there must be plenty
of those here.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.162
We know that you were
with Alfonse

29:33.206 --> 29:34.685
at the time of the murder.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.600
You didn't kill Dr. Reed,
but maybe that's because

29:36.644 --> 29:38.428
you hired someone else
to do it for you.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.691
Or maybe, just maybe,
you're not behind

29:40.735 --> 29:42.650
Dr. Reed's violent
murder, you just...

29:42.693 --> 29:44.957
you just have
a recording of it.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.133
If that's the case,
then you can see how

29:47.176 --> 29:49.613
it would be in your best
interest to share it with us.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.660
I've never seen that before.

29:54.401 --> 29:58.405
No one here put it
in Candace's office.

29:58.448 --> 30:02.104
But... just for a second,
let's...

30:02.148 --> 30:05.455
let's say they did.

30:05.499 --> 30:09.198
It would have picked up all
kinds of conversations, right?

30:10.678 --> 30:12.767
Maybe even a couple
of detectives

30:12.811 --> 30:17.467
talking about how they
stole evidence

30:17.511 --> 30:19.818
from the scene of a crime.

30:22.646 --> 30:26.433
I'm just speculating, but, um...

30:26.476 --> 30:29.784
we might have arrived
at an impasse.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.134
Beyond this, it's possible
there is only

30:32.178 --> 30:35.050
mutually assured destruction.

30:35.094 --> 30:38.749
Well, you're a partner in a
multi-billion-dollar firm.

30:38.793 --> 30:42.231
You're answerable to
the board, shareholders.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.930
We're just a couple
of police consultants

30:44.973 --> 30:46.932
that color outside the lines.

30:46.975 --> 30:51.980
So while our, uh, destruction
might be mutual,

30:52.024 --> 30:55.854
it will by no means be equal.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.073
Come on.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.423
Looks like we have
a confession

31:00.467 --> 31:02.861
to make to our captain.

31:02.904 --> 31:07.169
If-if I can produce a tape,

31:07.213 --> 31:10.651
you have to keep
the firm out of it.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.740
Can you agree to that?

31:12.783 --> 31:14.960
We'll do what we can.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.788
Give me until tomorrow morning.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.316
WATSON:
Lin?

31:23.359 --> 31:24.839
Out here.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.629
So, what do you think, hmm?

31:32.673 --> 31:34.762
I think that if you
did not get

31:34.805 --> 31:36.546
multiple bids
on this place today,

31:36.590 --> 31:38.766
then... it's gotta
be haunted.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.942
[laughs]
It's not haunted,

31:40.986 --> 31:43.118
just massively overpriced.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.774
Today was open
house number 16.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.994
Truth is, I'm sort of getting
used to not selling it.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.779
Means I get to enjoy
the view that much longer.

31:51.822 --> 31:54.608
It's gorgeous.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.610
So what's up?

31:58.699 --> 32:01.658
You know all that stuff
you read yesterday,

32:01.702 --> 32:03.965
the stuff your therapist
wrote about you?

32:04.009 --> 32:06.663
It really hurt you, didn't it?

32:08.883 --> 32:12.495
Oh, I don't know if "hurt"
is the right word.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.845
But it surprised me.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.893
I shouldn't have joked about it.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.330
Here's the thing:

32:21.374 --> 32:23.506
your dead therapist was a quack.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.205
I am so, so sorry for
what happened to her,

32:26.248 --> 32:28.685
but she obviously
didn't get you.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.644
Lin, you read the same notes
that I did.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.211
She totally got me.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.952
She saw what everyone sees
when they look at you.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.910
You're smart, strong,

32:35.954 --> 32:37.346
funny, driven,

32:37.390 --> 32:38.782
compassionate.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.828
She added all that
up, and, somehow,

32:40.871 --> 32:44.875
she came up with the one
thing you're not, a mom.

32:44.919 --> 32:49.315
I'm sorry, but I
think that stinks.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.491
Everything she saw in you
that matters,

32:51.534 --> 32:53.493
all your best qualities,

32:53.536 --> 32:57.845
they're not the things that
would make you a great mother--

32:57.888 --> 33:01.588
they're the things that domake
you a great detective.

33:01.631 --> 33:04.373
A great friend.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.420
A great sister.

33:07.463 --> 33:10.249
I don't care what
you saw in that file.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.686
If it made you unhappy or
feel incomplete somehow,

33:12.729 --> 33:13.817
you're crazy.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.907
You are the most

33:16.951 --> 33:19.040
complete person I've ever met.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.696
[chuckles]

33:24.524 --> 33:28.702
I-I may have had a glass of wine
before you got here.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.704
[chuckles]
Ugh.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.880
Do you have one for me, too?

33:32.923 --> 33:35.926
[chuckles]
[chuckles]

33:37.102 --> 33:38.364
[whirring]

33:38.407 --> 33:40.409
[hissing]

33:42.411 --> 33:44.935
[grunts]

33:49.853 --> 33:51.507
[grunts]

33:53.248 --> 33:54.554
[grunts]

33:55.642 --> 33:57.861
[exhales]

34:01.648 --> 34:04.477
Looking for this?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.609
Mr. Clay.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.871
You know who I am.

34:08.916 --> 34:12.527
I put a great deal of pressure
on the managing partner

34:12.572 --> 34:15.531
of a very powerful
accounting firm today.

34:15.574 --> 34:17.793
You think I would've done so
without identifying

34:17.838 --> 34:20.623
the firm's fixer beforehand?

34:20.667 --> 34:22.625
So did Sydney Place

34:22.668 --> 34:25.715
send you with a recording
of Candace Reed's murder?

34:25.759 --> 34:28.978
Or... did you come to fix me?

34:29.023 --> 34:32.025
Well, I don't have a recording
for you.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.114
I do have...

34:34.159 --> 34:36.857
these.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.036
"Jane Austen On Ice."

34:43.081 --> 34:45.561
It's even worse
than it sounds.

34:45.605 --> 34:49.043
But my baby girl
loves to skate.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.829
Now you know where I was
when Dr. Reed was killed.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.744
So you've broken into my home

34:54.788 --> 34:57.007
to confess
that you're a good father.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.097
Hmm.
Is that
supposed to prove

34:59.140 --> 35:01.099
that your boss wasn't involved?
'Cause, in my experience,

35:01.142 --> 35:04.624
a man like Sydney Place knows
more than one goon.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.888
If Sydney was involved,
I would know it.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.499
Believe that.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.155
Alfonse Kapoor
was sharing corporate secrets

35:14.199 --> 35:15.896
with his therapist.

35:15.939 --> 35:19.552
If word got out that
Foster & Place had a leak...

35:19.595 --> 35:21.336
We'd be screwed. Obviously.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.686
That's why we bugged her office.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.993
But that's all we did.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.526
Dr. Reed wasn't
acting on the tips

35:37.570 --> 35:40.964
Alfonse gave her, and she didn't
pass them on to her friends.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.141
There was no leak.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.795
She took his secrets
to her grave.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.101
Well, prove it.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.582
Provide me with an audio
recording of her murder.

35:49.625 --> 35:53.151
I can't. I destroyed
it days ago.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.805
You destroyed evidence
of a murder.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.894
I destroyed evidence
of mycrime,

35:57.938 --> 36:00.332
bugging her office.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.073
That's the other
reason I came here.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.945
To tell you
there was nothing on the tape

36:04.988 --> 36:07.208
that would help you identify
the killer.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.471
So you listened to it?

36:11.081 --> 36:13.083
And what did you hear?

36:13.127 --> 36:15.173
I just told you--
nothing that's gonna help...

36:15.216 --> 36:17.218
I'll be the judge of that.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.002
30 minutes after
her last patient left.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.222
I think she was
getting ready to go.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.006
I heard a door open,

36:23.050 --> 36:25.574
and he was just on her.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.837
She couldn't
even scream.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.839
She went fast, but...

36:29.883 --> 36:34.409
he just kept stabbing
and stabbing.

36:34.453 --> 36:37.064
Never said anything?

36:37.107 --> 36:39.240
Oh, he did.
At the end, after he was done.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.416
But it was just gibberish.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.725
Sounded like...

36:45.768 --> 36:49.250
"ay-oh-nee-uh-in-imi."

36:49.294 --> 36:51.513
Say that again.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.994
"Ay-oh-nee-uh-in-imi."

36:54.037 --> 36:55.474
You're sure that's what he said?

36:55.517 --> 36:58.085
I probably listened to it
a hundred times.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.087
That mean something to you?

37:00.130 --> 37:02.132
It means three things, actually.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.917
One, you're an imbecile,

37:03.960 --> 37:06.136
'cause there was something
important on that tape.

37:06.180 --> 37:10.010
Two, I think I know
who killed Dr. Reed.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.491
And what's the third thing?

37:12.534 --> 37:14.144
I can show you this now.

37:14.188 --> 37:17.017
I've been making a recording
of our conversation.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.976
Now, if you
don't leave my home,

37:20.020 --> 37:23.241
it, too, will end in a murder.

37:25.634 --> 37:28.115
Just not mine.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.562
Sorry, Alfonse, we're gonna have
to cut this session short.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.608
We got much to talk about.

37:42.651 --> 37:43.652
What is this? What's going on?

37:43.696 --> 37:45.001
BELL:
This is what we call

37:45.045 --> 37:46.873
questioning a suspect
in a homicide.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.222
If you'll excuse us?

37:55.142 --> 37:56.535
Oh, you might want
to stay close.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.101
This man's about to need
a lot more therapy.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.103
I-I don't understand.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.062
Sydney told me
that he spoke with you.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.151
He told you
where I was the other night.

38:04.194 --> 38:05.805
Is he watching?

38:05.848 --> 38:07.459
Oh, yeah.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.416
He's very curious.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.461
What?

38:09.504 --> 38:10.462
Apologies, Alfonse.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.115
You're not a suspect.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.292
Dr. Demopoulos is.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.771
This is not an
interrogation,

38:15.815 --> 38:18.165
It's a piece of theatre.

38:18.208 --> 38:21.386
We want him to think that
we think that you're the killer.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.996
Why?

38:23.039 --> 38:24.302
I will explain, I just need you
to look afraid,

38:24.345 --> 38:26.304
like I'm accusing you
of something.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.788
Last night, I was
approached by

38:32.832 --> 38:34.703
an earwitness to the murder.

38:34.747 --> 38:37.793
He didn't want to reveal himself
to the police, unfortunately,

38:37.837 --> 38:40.230
but he did tell me that he
heard the killer say something.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.755
"Aionia I mnimi."

38:42.798 --> 38:43.843
BELL:
It's Greek.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.367
It means "memory eternal."

38:46.411 --> 38:47.847
It's a phrase you might be
familiar with if you grew up

38:47.890 --> 38:50.415
going to Greek
Orthodox funerals.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.373
As Dr. Demopoulos, being of
Greek immigrant parents,

38:52.417 --> 38:53.853
often did.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.246
S-So? That doesn't
prove anything.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.378
I said the same thing.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.380
But then, Mr. Holmes told me

38:59.424 --> 39:01.817
you have a bad habit of
sharing insider information

39:01.861 --> 39:04.254
with your therapists.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.256
Something to do with
"transference" or something?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.520
How-how could you
know about that?

39:08.563 --> 39:10.304
Suffice it to say, if I were
you, I would stop going

39:10.348 --> 39:14.352
to see therapists who are in
buildings owned by Sydney Place.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.875
Anyway, the important thing is,

39:15.918 --> 39:18.181
Demopoulos came to see you
the other day.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.662
I assume that was not your
first session with him?

39:20.706 --> 39:24.666
Uh, no. Uh, he and Dr. Reed used
to cover each other's patients.

39:24.710 --> 39:28.409
I saw him a couple of times last
year when she was out of town.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.629
And you did
what you always do, right?

39:30.672 --> 39:32.457
Talked about your job,
shared information

39:32.500 --> 39:35.329
that could be used
to profit on the stock market?

39:35.373 --> 39:37.897
See, he realized you
were a golden goose.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.986
And he wanted you
all to himself.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.684
No eye contact
with the audience, please.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.120
Ruins the illusion.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.386
ALFONSE: If everything
that you're saying is true,

39:48.429 --> 39:50.300
then why are we even doing this?
Why don't you just arrest him?

39:50.344 --> 39:51.737
BELL:
Because.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.869
A couple nights ago,
a man named Isaac Marlowe

39:53.913 --> 39:55.697
called Mr. Holmes
and his partner to say

39:55.741 --> 39:58.439
he was with Dr. Demopoulos
in New Rochelle

39:58.483 --> 39:59.484
at the time of
the murder.

39:59.527 --> 40:00.572
HOLMES: Mr. Marlowe,
as it turns out,

40:00.615 --> 40:02.748
is an investment banker.

40:02.791 --> 40:04.489
We think he's partners
with the doctor.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.404
but we can't prove it,
so we're hoping

40:06.447 --> 40:08.580
that this little performance
will encourage the doctor

40:08.623 --> 40:10.364
to dig up evidence
that we can use.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.758
The murder weapon, for example.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.369
What do-what do you mean?
Why would he do that?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.675
Because.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.372
You go down
for Dr. Reed's murder,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.156
you can't be
his meal ticket anymore.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.375
You'd lose your job,

40:21.419 --> 40:22.985
go to prison.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.379
If he plants evidence on someone
else, on the other hand,

40:25.423 --> 40:29.427
makes it look like that person

Dr. Demopoulos is smart.

You really think
he's gonna fall for this?

Mm. Why don't you go and tell
him this is gonna take

40:38.392 --> 40:40.220
a little longer
and he should go on his way?

40:46.400 --> 40:50.056
I'm not a psychiatrist, Alfonse,
but I do know the criminal mind.

40:50.099 --> 40:52.580
We'll give him an hour
before he entraps himself.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.472
Yes and no.

He's here, but he is floating
in a metal box

No, I just thought you'd both
want to know it's done.

Dr. Demopoulos was arrested
a little while ago.

for the murder weapon.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.398
Straight from
the hospital.

to join for the interrogation.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.935
an hour before I have
to pull him out of the tank,

41:42.978 --> 41:44.676

I'd take advantage of the time

41:44.719 --> 41:46.373

of my own work done.
