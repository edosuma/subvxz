WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:06.603
I still wish you were coming
to New York with me

00:06.639 --> 00:07.936
for the holiday.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.305
Next time.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.071
I've got a whole family
waiting to meet you, you know.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.204
Well, you weren't in any rush
to introduce us last summer.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.235
Yeah, well,

00:14.280 --> 00:16.748
a lot's happened
since last summer.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.182
Mmm...

00:19.285 --> 00:21.219
All right, Keats,
this is your last chance

00:21.254 --> 00:23.188
to blow off your family
and stay here

00:23.223 --> 00:24.622
for a real
Walsh Thanksgiving.

00:24.657 --> 00:25.783
Brandon, you know I can't.

00:25.825 --> 00:27.622
I mean, believe me,
I wish I could,

00:27.660 --> 00:29.890
but I haven't seen my
grandparents in over a year.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.920
Yeah, but you're gonna
miss out on my famous

00:31.965 --> 00:33.193
bourbon sweet potatoes.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.564
Famous, huh?

00:34.601 --> 00:35.590
World-famous.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.296
Hmm. Since when do you cook?

00:37.337 --> 00:38.497
Since tomorrow.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.737
So, tell me something.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.336
How am I supposed
to feel about the fact

00:45.378 --> 00:47.505
that you're spending
Thanksgiving with Brandon?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.572
What are you talking about?

00:49.616 --> 00:50.640
You know what
I'm talking about.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.945
You're worried
about Brandon now

00:51.985 --> 00:53.111
after all this time?

00:53.153 --> 00:54.381
It's not that weird.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.548
I mean, I'm a little
jealous, that's all.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.023
And he gets to be
with you, I don't.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.390
Snap out of it.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.758
- Snap out of it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.786
Absolutely, okay?

01:06.766 --> 01:09.257
I've got to ask you something.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.530
What?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.970
Is, um, Kelly gonna be
around this weekend?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.506
Well, I think so.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.509
She's coming over
for Thanksgiving dinner.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.635
Oh.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.144
- Oh?
- It's just that

01:19.179 --> 01:20.612
I wish she weren't,
that's all.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.878
Susan, how many times
do I have to tell you,

01:23.917 --> 01:25.782
you got nothing to worry about.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.411
So then why am I so worried?

01:27.454 --> 01:29.786
I don't know, have I ever
given you reason to worry?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.552
Oh, so, what, now I'm paranoid?

01:31.591 --> 01:34.219
Well...

01:34.260 --> 01:36.820
Mmm.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.490
Feel any better?

01:38.531 --> 01:40.761
Yeah.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.700
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.726
Me, too.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.640 --> 02:56.939
I cannot believe we waited
till the last minute to do this.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.171
Everyone waits till
the last minute, don't they?

02:59.212 --> 03:01.476
Let's hope not... otherwise,
we'll be here forever.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.381
Okay, the plan is, we meet at
the checkout in half an hour.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.647
You think we're gonna
be done in 30 minutes?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.483
Absolutely.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.955
It was sweet of you
to invite me along, Valerie.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.422
Of course!
You're David's mother...

03:12.458 --> 03:14.221
I couldn't let you
spend Thanksgiving alone.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.454
Well, don't forget,

03:15.495 --> 03:17.087
it won't be Thanksgiving
without my Jell-O mold.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.155
Yeah, it's in the
shape of a turkey,

03:19.199 --> 03:20.257
with cranberries for eyes.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.858
Hey, don't make fun of my mold.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.698
You loved it
when you were a kid.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.567
Hey, it was always
good for a laugh.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.436
David!

03:30.310 --> 03:32.642
All right, everybody got
their shopping lists?

03:32.679 --> 03:34.647
- Got it.
- Let's do it.

03:40.153 --> 03:45.147
Register three now open,
no waiting.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.933
Attention shoppers, check out
our fresh-baked pumpkin pies,

04:00.974 --> 04:03.306
just in time for the holiday.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.791
We need a clean-up
on aisle seven.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.902
I need a price check

04:36.943 --> 04:39.673
on a 24-ounce bag
of fresh cranberries.

04:40.713 --> 04:41.839
What's that?

04:41.881 --> 04:44.577
A little bourbon
for your bourbon sweet potatoes.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.744
The recipe only calls
for half a cup.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.380
Yeah, but what's the sense
of going to all that trouble

04:49.422 --> 04:51.982
if you're gonna have
a sober soufflé, huh?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.492
He's right.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.460
Sober soufflé.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.292
Clare, everyone's almost
done... will you hurry up?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.798
Okay, help me decide...
what do you think, red or white?

04:59.832 --> 05:01.732
That's easy...
red for the dark meat

05:01.768 --> 05:02.530
and white for the white meat.

05:02.568 --> 05:03.694
No, no, not for tonight...

05:03.736 --> 05:05.328
for my father's cocktail
party, remember?

05:05.371 --> 05:07.771
That's easy... eggheads
like to sip sherry.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.240
They're not eggheads.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.708
They're the senior faculty

05:10.743 --> 05:13.371
for the most prestigious
university in this state.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.382
Oh, boy, I don't know if I can
stand the excitement, Clare.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.542
Fine, then don't come.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.517
It's not like I'm dying
to introduce you

05:19.552 --> 05:21.042
to my father anyway.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.714
Are you ashamed of me?

05:22.755 --> 05:23.779
Yeah.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.313
Kidding.

05:25.358 --> 05:28.486
Besides, you're the one making
a big deal out of this, not me.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.792
What if I brought
my report card?

05:30.830 --> 05:33.663
I'm sure my father's
already seen it.

05:35.968 --> 05:39.062
Oh, Brandon, come
here, come here.

05:39.105 --> 05:42.438
Wouldn't this be nice
on the table?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.966
Some irises, some lilies.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.411
Sure.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.609
That should about
do it, huh?

05:50.650 --> 05:53.551
You know, you have
a knack for that.

05:53.586 --> 05:56.646
- What's that?
- Making things pretty.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.281
Thanks.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.088
It's gonna be a great
Thanksgiving, don't you think?

06:03.396 --> 06:06.024
You're feeling a little
empty, aren't you?

06:06.065 --> 06:07.498
What do you mean, empty?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.330
You know what
I'm talking about.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.666
Behind all the big talk

06:10.703 --> 06:14.298
about this being our first
Thanksgiving on our own,

06:14.340 --> 06:16.205
you miss your family, right?

06:17.243 --> 06:19.143
Yeah.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.805
But you're here.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.008
Yes, I am.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.643
It'll be fun.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.087
You'll see.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.954
Thanks.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.524
We better hurry up...
it's getting late.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.085
I know, and I still have
to go home and change first.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.622
Hi. So, we'll drop all this
stuff off at your place.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.224
And I'm sorry we can't
hang out with you guys today.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.701
Oh, I know.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.966
You sure you don't want us
to come along for moral support?

06:46.005 --> 06:47.529
No, it's just a deposition.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.734
Oh, I forgot
the chopped walnuts.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.074
Oh, I'll get them.
Back in a sec.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.173
He's hiding it well,
but he's pretty upset.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.978
He's got to be... his
entire football career

06:58.084 --> 06:59.642
- could be on the line.
- I know.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.209
Look, you guys, do me a favor.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.812
Promise me that
after the deposition today,

07:02.855 --> 07:05.585
no one will mention Ray Pruit
or the case the entire weekend.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.614
You got it.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.354
Okay. Well, I better
go rescue Joe.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.385
He may know how
to throw a football,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.159
but he knows nothing
about chopped nuts.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.626
I can't believe Ray
is going through with this.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.932
Well, I guess with some
people you never know

07:17.970 --> 07:19.460
what's really going
on inside them.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.268
You don't even know
the half of it.

07:21.307 --> 07:22.274
Yeah, I do.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.173
Valerie told me
about Palm Springs.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.407
Donna didn't want anybody to
know what happened between them,

07:27.447 --> 07:31.178
and now it's all gonna
come out in open court.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.425
Well, we've just got
one problem... convincing Valerie

07:40.460 --> 07:42.860
to let us eat dinner
in front of the television.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.295
- Steve! - Aw, come on, Val,
otherwise what good is it

07:45.331 --> 07:48.061
- not having my mother around?
- You hear that?

07:48.100 --> 07:50.898
I, for one, can't digest my food
without the Dallas Cowboys.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.337
Listen, we are sitting
at the dining room table

07:53.372 --> 07:55.636
and have a proper meal
like civilized people.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.870
- Right, Sheila? - Well, Valerie
does have a point.

07:57.910 --> 08:01.107
A woman after
my very own heart.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.877
Guys, I'm not
with these two, really.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.747
Well, don't set a place for me.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.083
I'm gonna watch the game...
all the games.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.451
That's my girl.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.922
- Traitor.
- Guys,

08:10.990 --> 08:13.015
Nat just called... pies
are ready at the Pit.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.822
- Who wants to pick 'em up?
- I'll go.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.829
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.532
Well, what do you
think of those two?

08:23.936 --> 08:26.200
I don't know, should I
be thinking something?

08:26.239 --> 08:28.605
Well, they're good friends.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.734
Yeah.

08:30.776 --> 08:34.303
Who almost got engaged
six months ago.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.988
So, how's life, Brandon?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.224
What kind of question is that?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.231
You see me almost every day.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.960
I know.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.467
Are you still feeling
weird about Dylan?

08:56.502 --> 08:57.696
Yeah, a little.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.570
Maybe he'll send us
a postcard someday.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.574
He will when he's ready.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.907
I have to ask you something.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.378
And... don't take this
the wrong way.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.905
If you don't want
to talk about it,

09:10.983 --> 09:13.178
I'll understand, but...

09:13.219 --> 09:15.187
Was Susan...

09:15.221 --> 09:17.155
did she feel...

09:17.189 --> 09:22.422
uncomfortable about you and me
spending the holiday together?

09:22.461 --> 09:25.487
Um, 'cause... Colin did,

09:25.531 --> 09:28.728
and I just told him that
he was being... paranoid,

09:28.768 --> 09:31.601
and that he didn't have
anything to worry about.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.162
Well, that's exactly
what I told Susan.

09:34.206 --> 09:37.141
- Good.
- Good.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.183
David, can't you see
I'm... busy here?

09:52.458 --> 09:55.188
I'm just trying to
organize everything.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.319
Silver, you don't have

09:56.362 --> 09:57.886
to alphabetize
all the canned goods.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.192
Maybe I can just

09:59.231 --> 10:02.394
- offer a suggestion or two?
- Sure.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.800
Are you planning to cook

10:03.836 --> 10:05.235
breast-side-up or
breast-side-down?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.068
I haven't really
thought about it.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.539
Well, most people roast
breast-side-up,

10:08.574 --> 10:10.303
but that dries the bird out.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.937
If you want the white meat
especially tender,

10:12.979 --> 10:14.810
I recommend breast-side-down.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.678
Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.514
Uh, Mom, I think we can
handle everything from here.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.712
Oh, I'm sure you can.

10:20.753 --> 10:24.086
I just wanted to help
to get things started.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.182
David, can I see you outside?

10:30.896 --> 10:33.524
I know, I know.
What do you want me to do?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.158
She's just trying
to be helpful.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.668
This is supposed to be
our chance

10:36.702 --> 10:37.999
to make Thanksgiving together.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.265
Friends. No parents.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.294
And now she's taking over.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.772
Why don't you just let her help?

10:41.807 --> 10:43.240
It might make it
a little easier.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.835
I don't want it to be easy,
I want to do it myself.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.472
So, what do you
want me to do?

10:48.514 --> 10:51.449
Just try and keep her
out of my hair, okay?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.111
And stop alphabetizing

10:53.152 --> 10:56.087
- the canned goods.
- Okay.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.186
Look, I just want you to know
I really appreciate this.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.217
It... means a lot to her.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.489
I know.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.463
I'll try and be nice.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.625
Even though you want
to kill her, right?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.534
Sorry to interrupt, but where
do you keep the mixing bowls?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.502
Top shelf.

11:13.539 --> 11:14.801
Thanks.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.577
What?

11:25.418 --> 11:26.885
Okay, you got it.
Hello!

11:26.919 --> 11:29.979
We got pies, we got apple,
we got pumpkin, we got peach.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.150
And Nat says to cook
the turkey breast-side up.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.423
Well, I planned to, but David's
mother says breast-side down.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.952
Can't we just
shove her in the oven?

11:39.498 --> 11:41.432
I'm sorry, do I sense
a little tension here?

11:41.467 --> 11:43.435
You know, I'm trying,
Brandon, but it's not easy.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.198
I mean, she actually made
David go back to the store

11:45.237 --> 11:47.569
because she didn't like the
brand of margarine I bought.

11:47.606 --> 11:48.732
Hmm.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.742
So, where's Sanders?

11:51.777 --> 11:54.268
He and Clare left
for the faculty party.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.110
She was practically
dragging him.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.513
I'll get it.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.476
Hello?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.146
Oh, hey, Colin.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.883
How's the big apple?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.914
Yeah, she's right here.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.391
I'll, um...

12:07.426 --> 12:08.825
I'll take it
in the living room.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.125
Hold on.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.961
Well, it must be nice
for you guys.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.800
- What?
- Well, being able to hang out

12:19.839 --> 12:22.364
again together without
your new significant others

12:22.408 --> 12:23.432
looking over your shoulder.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.808
You know, Val...

12:25.845 --> 12:27.710
you have a dirty mind.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.977
I didn't mean it like that.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.276
Maybe you have the dirty mind.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.807
Oh, I don't think so.

12:44.830 --> 12:45.990
Hi, Bruce.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.657
Hey, how're you two holding up?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.327
Well, I'm a little nervous.

12:49.368 --> 12:50.426
Don't be.

12:50.469 --> 12:51.936
Just answer the questions
truthfully,

12:51.971 --> 12:53.905
we'll get you out of here
before you know it.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.668
Well, I don't understand how Joe
can be in so much trouble

12:55.708 --> 12:56.868
when he was just protecting me.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.342
I mean, is that
against the law?

12:58.377 --> 13:01.346
You let me worry
about the law, okay?

13:01.380 --> 13:03.348
You just tell them what
happened on Halloween night.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.906
And give yes or no answers.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.316
If you can't remember the exact
details about something,

13:07.353 --> 13:09.480
you just say,
"I don't remember."

13:09.522 --> 13:11.149
Okay.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.089
Hey, listen, after
you're done here,

13:15.127 --> 13:16.424
why don't we go
over to Brandon's?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.157
Valerie said they'd
be cooking all night.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.631
I can't, there's something
I have to take care of.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.928
What?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.559
It's a surprise.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.297
But trust me, if it works out,

13:25.337 --> 13:27.066
you're gonna have the happy
birthday after all.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.733
Sounds good to me.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.255
We're ready to go, Mr. Paxton?

13:43.289 --> 13:44.449
Yes, ma'am.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.357
Let's get this thing over with.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.384
Have a seat here, Joe.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.864
Before we begin, would you
state your full name, please.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.333
Donna Marie Martin.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.563
Would you raise your right hand.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.629
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

14:00.673 --> 14:01.697
and nothing but the truth,

14:01.740 --> 14:03.708
- so help you God?
- I do.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.141
I just have
a few questions,

14:05.177 --> 14:06.667
Ms. Martin.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.703
On the night of
October 31, 1995,

14:08.747 --> 14:10.510
an argument took place

14:10.549 --> 14:11.573
at your home, correct?

14:11.617 --> 14:12.948
Yes.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.145
And during that argument,

14:14.186 --> 14:17.815
did you see Mr. Bradley
strike Mr. Pruit?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.882
Yes.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.324
How many times?

14:24.897 --> 14:26.091
I don't remember.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.894
More than once?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.699
Yes.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.501
Did Mr. Pruit
strike Mr. Bradley?

14:35.808 --> 14:38.538
No, but you don't understand.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.704
Please, just answer
the questions.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.044
Did Mr. Pruit
strike Mr. Bradley?

14:44.383 --> 14:45.850
No.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.409
The next time you saw Mr. Pruit

14:47.453 --> 14:49.683
was there any evidence of
the altercation you witnessed?

14:50.990 --> 14:52.355
Yes.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.653
And what was that?

14:54.860 --> 14:56.987
Ray's left arm was in a brace.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.621
Thank you, Ms. Martin.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.325
That pretty much covers it.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.161
Donna...

15:05.204 --> 15:07.468
Don't talk to me.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.064
Come on, Mr. Pruit.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.268
Save it for court.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.465
Well, I'm glad to see not
everyone's drinking sherry.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.840
I actually see
a beer bottle or two.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.107
- Clare!
- Dad, hi.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.137
This is, uh, Steve Sanders.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.705
- This is my dad.
- Nice to see you.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.444
I'm hearing a lot about you,
young man.

15:52.484 --> 15:53.610
Oh, really?

15:53.652 --> 15:54.949
Don't believe
everything Clare says.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.181
Actually, not from Clare,

15:56.221 --> 15:57.813
from John Bardwell.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.448
Isn't he your
academic advisor?

15:59.491 --> 16:00.480
Yeah.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.084
One of my very best friends.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.424
He's here tonight.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.453
- Excuse me, sweetheart.
- Good.

16:05.497 --> 16:06.930
I'm outta here.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.056
Steve, wait.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.362
- What's wrong?
- Are you kidding?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.096
Mr. Bardwell's the guy
who found out

16:11.136 --> 16:13.070
I cheated on
my math placement tests.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.538
He probably told
your father everything.

16:14.573 --> 16:15.938
Mr. Sanders.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.440
What a pleasant surprise.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.568
Yes, it is.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.702
- Hello, Clare.
- Hi.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.713
How's the remedial math going?

16:21.747 --> 16:24.045
- Fine.
- Good, good.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.948
What brings you
to this gathering?

16:26.018 --> 16:27.883
Well, actually,
Clare and I are dating.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.944
Oh, that's right.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.648
Arnold mentioned it.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.487
Well, I guess
opposites do attract.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.288
Oh, excuse me,

16:35.327 --> 16:37.227
I see someone
I must say hello to.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.320
Bye.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.195
Did you hear that?

16:40.232 --> 16:42.097
He practically insulted me
right to my face.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.101
He did not.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.159
"Opposites attract"?

16:44.203 --> 16:45.227
What do you think that means?

16:45.270 --> 16:46.897
Why are you so down on yourself?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.736
Why shouldn't I be?

16:48.774 --> 16:50.241
I've been a classic
underachiever

16:50.275 --> 16:51.640
my entire academic life.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.736
You know, I may be a C student,
but I'm no dummy

16:53.779 --> 16:55.269
and I'm sick of these people
thinking that I am.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.713
Who, who's calling
you a dummy here?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.341
All these people.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.284
You called these people
eggheads this morning.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.911
Why all of sudden do you care
what they think of you?

17:01.987 --> 17:03.249
- I don't get it.
- You know what,

17:03.288 --> 17:04.880
I wouldn't expect you
to understand, Clare.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.517
They know you're a genius, okay?

17:07.559 --> 17:08.890
Why don't you go mingle
with the high-brows.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.087
I'll be right here.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.421
Great.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.932
Donna Martin.
I'm a friend of Steve Young's.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.531
He's appearing on NFL Li <i>v</i> e
tonight.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.098
Sorry, Miss.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.166
Nobody cleared you.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.575
I can't let you in.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.274
Well, could you call upstairs
to Mr. Young's agent?

17:29.314 --> 17:30.747
His name's Leigh Steinberg.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.614
I know.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.950
Look, I just really need
to talk to him.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.513
Well, I'm sorry, but
the taping's over, Miss.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.720
I'm sure Mr. Steinberg
and Mr. Young have already left.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.126
Great.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.331
Oh, my God.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.359
"Sports Agent."

17:52.404 --> 17:54.201
That's gotta be him.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.767
What are you doing?

17:59.011 --> 18:00.273
Mr. Steinberg, stop, please.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.143
- What's the problem?
- Are you Leigh Steinberg?

18:02.181 --> 18:03.512
- Steve Young's agent?
- Yes.

18:03.549 --> 18:04.846
I'm sorry, Mr. Steinberg.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.908
We'll have this under
control in just a moment.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.919
Look, Mr. Steinberg,
you don't know who I am,

18:09.021 --> 18:10.579
but I'm Donna Martin.
John Martin's daughter.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.749
The heart surgeon, he did
your father's bypass?

18:12.791 --> 18:13.849
- Right.
- Look, if I could just have

18:13.892 --> 18:15.120
one minute of your time,
please?

18:15.160 --> 18:17.185
Come on, little lady,
get back in your car.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.389
It's all right.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.266
Talk to me.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.564
What's the problem?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.070
Okay.
Thank you.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.302
Joe Bradley's my boyfriend,
you might've heard of him.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.433
The C.U. quarterback?

18:30.476 --> 18:31.773
Yes, that's him.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.300
Anyway, tomorrow's
Joe's birthday

18:33.345 --> 18:34.539
and nothing would
make him happier

18:34.580 --> 18:36.411
than if Steve Young
could come to the house.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.313
Well, I mean, it's not his
house, it's my friend's house,

18:38.350 --> 18:39.476
'cause that's where we'll be.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.247
You know, just to wish
him happy birthday.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.846
I mean, Steve Young
is Joe's hero.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.050
I mean he would just be so
excited to meet him in person.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.422
Look, Mr. Steinberg,

18:47.459 --> 18:49.393
in the name of love
and football,

18:49.428 --> 18:51.157
could you please help make my
boyfriend's dreams come true,

18:51.196 --> 18:52.754
please?

19:00.539 --> 19:02.473
More.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.636
You know, I take it back.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.235
You never should have come.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.771
You could've sat and eaten
your pistachios at home.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.080
Clare, I've got nothing to say
to these people,

19:13.118 --> 19:15.018
and they have nothing
to say to me.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.886
Stop sitting here like
such a wallflower, Sanders.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.790
You haven't spoken
to a soul all evening.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.851
Let me introduce you
to the faculty.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.159
Oh, great.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.260
Elmo, my dear, you may
have won a Pulitzer,

19:32.304 --> 19:34.932
but the comparison
is to Shakespearean comedy.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.564
Wrong. Helen,
would you trust me?

19:36.608 --> 19:37.632
It's French farce.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.075
Feydeau in his purest form.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.476
Stop bickering, Pickering.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.072
I want to introduce you
to some friends of mine.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.606
This is Clare Arnold,
Steve Sanders.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.949
Elmo Pickering and
this is Helen Kincaid,

19:48.020 --> 19:49.954
esteemed professors
of English literature.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.488
Nice to meet you both.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.491
Actually, I took your course,
Professor Kincaid.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.856
It was, it was great.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.088
Then perhaps you can
help settle this score.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.756
In analyzing the roots

19:58.797 --> 20:01.459
of contemporary American
television comedy,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.365
Professor Pickering
cites Feydeau.

20:03.402 --> 20:04.699
I say Shakespeare.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.033
What do you think?

20:08.640 --> 20:09.971
Sorry, not my field.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.634
Well, you know,
my mom always used to say

20:11.677 --> 20:13.872
that her show reminded her
of the works of Noel Coward.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.379
A comedy of manners.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.974
I don't mean to pry,
but who is your mother?

20:18.016 --> 20:19.483
Samantha Sanders,
maybe you've heard of her?

20:19.518 --> 20:20.576
Of course!

20:20.619 --> 20:21.847
The Hart/ey House.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.911
One of my favorites.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.185
Are you putting me
on, Mr. Bardwell?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.851
No, no, not at all.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.621
Your mother is a comic genius.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.719
You don't happen to have
any old scripts lying around?

20:30.762 --> 20:32.627
Sure, every one of 'em.
Bound.

20:32.664 --> 20:33.892
They're in my mom's library.

20:33.932 --> 20:34.990
Well, do you think...

20:35.100 --> 20:36.590
No, I couldn't ask.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.727
Do you want to look
at one of them?

20:37.769 --> 20:38.758
They're just collecting dust.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.772
- I'd be honored.
- You know, I...

20:40.806 --> 20:42.398
I hate to blow my own horn,

20:42.441 --> 20:44.636
but I contributed a lot of
story ideas to that show.

20:44.676 --> 20:45.802
You know, to give
it youth appeal.

20:46.945 --> 20:50.005
Steve, you were, like,
ten years old.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.516
Shut up.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.576
Steve, what I would really love,

20:54.620 --> 20:56.986
is if you'd come
to one of my seminars

20:57.022 --> 20:58.148
as a guest speaker.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.522
You know, sort of
an insider's view.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.083
Well, yeah, I'm an insider.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.253
I'd love to.

21:03.295 --> 21:04.353
Well, how're we doing?

21:04.396 --> 21:06.159
Great, Dad.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.723
The party is far less dull
this year, Arnold.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.325
Thanks to Mr. Sanders.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.666
Oh, please.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.933
Really?

21:13.972 --> 21:16.338
Well, if you don't mind,

21:16.375 --> 21:18.240
I'd like to steal you
away for a few minutes.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.574
There's a grad student
from Stanford

21:19.611 --> 21:21.442
I'd love to attract
to your program.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.708
Oh, okay.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.646
Nice to meet you, Steve.

21:23.682 --> 21:24.808
The pleasure was all mine.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.078
Hey, don't forget,
call my office.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.415
I certainly will.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.090
You know, Steve,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.424
I don't think you need to worry
about your math grades too much.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.450
You're going to do fine.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.588
Oh, yeah, you think so?

21:38.630 --> 21:39.995
You have a way with people.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.966
In other words,
you're a good B.S.'er.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.865
Mr. Bardwell.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.598
And sometimes that's more
important than anything else.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.503
I'm proud to be your advisor.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.599
If you need anything,
you come see me.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.110
Thanks, thanks a lot.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.975
What was that for?

21:59.017 --> 22:01.247
My favorite egghead.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.914
Let's go find another Laureate.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.950
Hey. How did it go
at the lawyer's?

22:09.027 --> 22:10.688
Terrible.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.663
I think I just
made things worse.

22:12.698 --> 22:13.960
I do not want

22:13.999 --> 22:15.261
to talk about the case anymore.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.768
I think I just
may have saved Joe's birthday.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.964
- What did you do?
- Well, Steve Young

22:20.005 --> 22:23.372
may actually show up
at Brandon's tomorrow afternoon.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.104
Wow! But what if he doesn't?
Do you have a Plan B?

22:26.144 --> 22:28.908
Yup. And it's going to be part
of Joe's birthday present

22:28.947 --> 22:30.915
even if I get Steve Young.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.713
What is it?

22:33.752 --> 22:37.711
Well, I've decided
to sleep with Joe.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.223
- Donna.
- What?

22:39.257 --> 22:40.690
I'm almost 21 years old.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.159
What am I waiting for?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.320
Especially since now I know

22:43.362 --> 22:45.796
my mom didn't give
it a second thought.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.321
Yeah, but this is
your life, not your mom's.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.994
Don't do anything
you're going to regret.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.969
Not doing it is what I regret.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.494
Joe's a great guy.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.975
I don't want to lose him.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.840
Just make sure
you don't lose everything

22:59.878 --> 23:01.345
you've always believed in.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.560
Brandon!

23:27.773 --> 23:29.570
Brandon!

23:29.608 --> 23:30.905
What?

23:30.942 --> 23:32.637
- It's 9:00.!
- So?

23:32.677 --> 23:33.644
So why didn't you wake me?

23:33.678 --> 23:34.645
Why don't you relax?!

23:34.679 --> 23:35.805
How can I relax?

23:35.847 --> 23:38.509
The turkey will
never be done in time!

23:48.126 --> 23:49.616
Sheila?

23:49.661 --> 23:50.787
Morning, honey.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.694
Come over here.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.461
Looks good, doesn't it?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.092
Breast-side down.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.933
Yeah. Yeah, I see.

23:59.971 --> 24:02.098
You don't mind, do you?

24:02.140 --> 24:03.402
I came over at 7:00
this morning,

24:03.442 --> 24:04.807
and Brandon let me in.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.333
You were still sound asleep.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.709
And, after all your hard work,

24:07.746 --> 24:09.304
I didn't have
the heart to wake you,

24:09.347 --> 24:11.338
so I thought I'd better
get the turkey started.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.353
- Oh.
- And I made the stuffing,

24:15.387 --> 24:18.788
I've shelled the peas,
and the Jell-O mold

24:18.824 --> 24:20.314
is setting as we speak.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.826
So is there anything left
for me to do?

24:22.861 --> 24:25.056
Uh... You can get dressed.

24:25.096 --> 24:28.896
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.129
Oh. What time are we eating
this feast of yours?

24:31.169 --> 24:33.330
I figure the bird
will be done just in time

24:33.371 --> 24:35.066
for the kickoff
of the Dallas game.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.974
You know, I thought

24:42.080 --> 24:43.570
I could pull this whole thing
off myself.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.217
I was a complete failure.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.913
No, you weren't.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.548
I just came along
and organized things.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.989
No. You came over
and saved the day.

24:53.024 --> 24:55.254
Valerie, maybe
cooking's not your thing,

24:55.293 --> 24:56.624
but, in case
you haven't noticed,

24:56.661 --> 24:59.858
you make my son very happy.

24:59.898 --> 25:01.923
You think so?

25:02.033 --> 25:05.799
I know so.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.869
Morning.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.347
Listen, Kel, I thought about

25:17.382 --> 25:19.407
what we talked about yesterday.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.942
- And?
- And...

25:21.987 --> 25:24.251
are condoms really safe?

25:24.289 --> 25:27.486
Not as safe as not doing it.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.153
What? So it's all right
for you, but not for me?

25:29.194 --> 25:33.893
No. How well
do you really know Joe?

25:33.932 --> 25:35.957
Do you know that he's not
sleeping with someone else?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.968
That's mean.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.197
No. I'm just saying

25:39.237 --> 25:41.671
that you barely know him.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.401
You should give it a little time

25:43.441 --> 25:44.533
before you jump
in the sack with him.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.100
Oh...! Morning.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.237
Oh, good. She's up.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.872
Why don't you ask
Clare for advice?

25:49.915 --> 25:51.507
She's just a wealth
of information.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.881
- What?
- Safe sex,

25:52.918 --> 25:55.148
birth control. You know.
The major questions of the '90s.

25:55.186 --> 25:58.815
Isn't it a little early
in the morning for this?

25:58.857 --> 26:00.381
- Definitely.
- You know what?

26:00.425 --> 26:02.256
Forget it. Forget I brought
the whole thing up.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.625
You know what?

26:03.662 --> 26:05.687
How was your father's
cocktail party last night? Hmm?

26:05.730 --> 26:07.129
Good. Steve was a hit.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.463
My father fell in love with him,

26:09.501 --> 26:12.061
and I think I did, too.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.567
Is that possible?

26:16.608 --> 26:18.473
Sure.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.445
Here we go.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.320
Mmm! Gobble, gobble, gobble!

26:33.358 --> 26:35.326
Val, that looks incredible.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.622
Well, I didn't do a thing.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.128
We owe it all to your mother.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.289
Except for Brandon's
famous sweet potatoes.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.457
Which none of you

26:40.498 --> 26:42.523
are having without me
seeing some I.D. first,

26:42.567 --> 26:44.091
so cough 'em up, kids.

26:44.135 --> 26:47.298
Listen, guys, I just want
to apologize for yesterday.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.306
You guys can eat

26:48.340 --> 26:49.364
turkey in the living room,

26:49.407 --> 26:50.840
and watch football all day long.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.570
- That's my girl!
- Cowboys!

26:52.611 --> 26:53.976
Hold on, big guy.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.377
Aren't you forgetting
about something?

26:55.413 --> 26:56.880
Yeah. Beer's in the fridge.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.815
No. I've got a beer.
It's Thanksgiving.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.374
Shouldn't someone say grace?

27:02.320 --> 27:06.222
All righty, then.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.849
I'll say it.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.458
Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub.

27:11.496 --> 27:12.463
Yay, God!

27:12.497 --> 27:14.055
- Dig in.
- Steve. Steve,

27:14.099 --> 27:16.363
I don't think that's exactly
what Joe had in mind.

27:16.401 --> 27:17.493
Joe, you want to give it a shot?

27:17.535 --> 27:19.298
Thanks.

27:21.706 --> 27:25.107
Thank you, God, for
your bountiful blessings,

27:25.143 --> 27:28.169
and for our warm beds at night,

27:28.213 --> 27:30.340
for the secure roof
over our heads,

27:30.382 --> 27:36.218
for our loving friends,
and to our nurturing families.

27:36.254 --> 27:39.121
Whatever the path
you've chosen for us,

27:39.157 --> 27:42.217
help us to be
sure-footed upon it. Amen.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.056
- Amen.
- Amen. - Amen.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.289
That was beautiful.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.493
Thanks. My dad used
to say that before every meal.

27:48.533 --> 27:49.898
Oh, we forgot something.

27:49.934 --> 27:50.958
Happy birthday.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.594
Happy birthday!

27:52.637 --> 27:54.628
Thank you very much.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.867
Okay, let's eat.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.807
Oh, guys, don't forget,

27:57.842 --> 27:58.968
Nat's expecting us all

27:59.010 --> 28:00.500
over at the Peach Pit
for the homeless thing.

28:00.545 --> 28:03.139
If I'm doing dishes over there,
I'm not doing dishes over here.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.910
You didn't tell me about this.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.711
What?

28:06.751 --> 28:09.049
About feeding the homeless.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.918
Well, we do it every year.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.354
It's kind of a tradition.

28:12.390 --> 28:13.755
Oh. I see.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.453
Ma, you don't have to go

28:15.493 --> 28:17.256
if it's going to
make you uncomfortable.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.923
No. I want to.

28:19.998 --> 28:23.297
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be one of them.

28:23.334 --> 28:25.666
Yeah. Well, you've come
a long way since then.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.831
I know.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.840
And I'm eternally grateful.

28:34.813 --> 28:37.338
What time is Steve Young
supposed to show up?

28:37.382 --> 28:39.612
His, uh... his agent
said about 1:00.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.085
It's almost 2:00.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.280
Yeah. I know.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.789
Oh. I'll get it.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.384
Where are those potatoes,
Brandon?

28:49.928 --> 28:52.123
Hello. Happy Thanksgiving.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.721
Oh, hi, Susan.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.596
Yeah, he's right here.
Hold on.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.659
Kelly, you've got to try
some of my sweet potatoes.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.637
Oh, I'm getting drunk
just smelling them.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.503
Uh... Brandon?

29:02.540 --> 29:04.405
- Yeah?
- It's Susan.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.843
Uh... Tell her I'll
take it upstairs.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.608
He'll be right there.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.239
I'm going to put you on hold,
okay?

29:19.023 --> 29:20.388
You okay?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.188
Why wouldn't I be?

29:22.227 --> 29:24.127
I was just trying to be nice.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.459
Do me a favor.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.590
Don't try so hard.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.299
On replay, you can see

29:31.336 --> 29:33.668
why Emmett Smith
picked up that first down.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.265
He's got Moose Johnson
and Big Nate Newton clearing...

29:36.307 --> 29:37.934
Oh, the game is on!

29:37.976 --> 29:40.376
What is it about turkey
that makes you so tired?

29:40.411 --> 29:42.743
Technically,
it's the tryptophan.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.078
It's a natural relaxer.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.742
I'm going to
overload on it, then.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.945
Listen, I hate to
not eat and run but,

29:48.019 --> 29:49.953
if I ever expect to get back
into that starting lineup,

29:49.988 --> 29:51.717
I better make an appearance
at the team dinner tonight.

29:51.756 --> 29:54.190
No. Can't you wait
another half hour?

29:54.225 --> 29:55.954
I'll come back.
Promise.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.551
It'll be too late.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.120
Too late for what?

30:00.165 --> 30:01.257
What's going on?

30:01.299 --> 30:04.200
Nothing. Just some lame idea

30:04.235 --> 30:06.135
I had for your birthday
that didn't work out.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.571
Don't worry. It's the
thought that counts.

30:08.606 --> 30:10.369
I can tell by your face

30:10.408 --> 30:11.932
that it must have
been a great thought.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.035
Come on.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.612
It's just that
I'm a Christmas baby,

30:20.652 --> 30:22.347
so I know how lousy it can be

30:22.387 --> 30:24.287
to have your birthday
on a holiday.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.313
I just thought you
deserved something special.

30:26.357 --> 30:28.416
I've already got
something special.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.552
I've got you.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.703
Excuse me. Anyone here

30:42.740 --> 30:44.765
- named Joe Bradley?
- That's me.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.709
Joe, heads up. This is for you.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.238
Oh, my God!

30:49.280 --> 30:50.747
Steve Young!

30:50.782 --> 30:52.010
Last time I checked.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.378
Happy birthday, Joe.

30:55.420 --> 30:56.682
How did you know
it was my birthday?

30:56.721 --> 30:58.120
Some crazy woman

30:58.156 --> 31:00.647
named Donna Martin jumped
in front of my agent's car,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.250
and here I am.

31:02.293 --> 31:03.317
How did you do this?

31:03.361 --> 31:04.692
Oh, it's a long story.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.959
You know, Joe, quarterbacks
have to stick together.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.159
Oh! You guys, get out here!

31:09.200 --> 31:11.065
Steve Young's here!

31:15.673 --> 31:18.767
Oh, man!

31:21.346 --> 31:23.473
Nice catch.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.574
Oh, this is what I call
a great pickup game.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.115
It's the fourth quarter,
last play of the game.

31:30.154 --> 31:33.920
Young's on the 20.
Let's get ready to rumble!

31:33.958 --> 31:35.789
Hut, hut!

31:45.003 --> 31:46.334
Touchdown!

31:46.371 --> 31:47.929
Perfect.

31:47.972 --> 31:50.702
I can't believe you caught that!

31:52.443 --> 31:55.003
Wish I could thread
the needle like that.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.512
Aw, Joe, keep working
on it. You'll get it.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.572
Steve, I can't
thank you enough.

31:58.616 --> 32:00.015
You've made this
such a special day.

32:00.051 --> 32:01.245
It was my pleasure to come.

32:01.286 --> 32:02.253
Here.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.686
Whoa! Nice ring.

32:03.721 --> 32:04.949
Yeah, I got that
out of a cereal box.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.490
What do you think?

32:06.524 --> 32:07.923
Listen, Steve, take 'em
all the way this year, huh?

32:07.959 --> 32:08.789
Yeah, hopefully.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.453
That's the idea. Keep it going.

32:10.495 --> 32:11.689
Hey, thanks.
It's been a lot of fun.

32:11.729 --> 32:12.696
I've got to get back
to the airport,

32:12.730 --> 32:13.958
but it was nice meeting you all.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.192
- Thanks a lot.
- You're the king.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.258
Hey, Joe, can
I see you for a second?

32:17.302 --> 32:18.929
Sure.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.234
Hey, I heard about you
getting benched last week,

32:21.272 --> 32:23.740
and I read about your legal
trouble that you've been in.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.175
Yeah, I might get
axed from the team.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.973
Listen, you're a good kid,
and you should never give up,

32:28.079 --> 32:30.138
but, you know,
guys like you and I,

32:30.181 --> 32:31.307
we eat, drink
and sleep football

32:31.349 --> 32:33.681
and, sooner or later,
it comes to an end,

32:33.718 --> 32:35.379
and you never know
when that's going to be,

32:35.420 --> 32:37.285
so take this
opportunity maybe

32:37.322 --> 32:38.983
to figure out what you're going
to do for the rest of your life.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.355
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You bet.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.359
Hey, it's been fun.

32:42.393 --> 32:43.985
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks a lot.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.461
Hey, we'll see you
in the Hall of Fame.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.729
You are amazing.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.432
You know that?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.202
Yeah, I know.

33:00.712 --> 33:04.478
You know, I wish I could say
that after all these years

33:04.515 --> 33:07.848
of doing this, that there were
fewer people that need it,

33:07.885 --> 33:10.217
but we had a bigger turnout
this Thanksgiving than ever.

33:10.254 --> 33:11.812
You're a good man, Nat.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.154
- Hey, I'll take this.
- Thanks.

33:14.192 --> 33:16.422
I am so stuffed.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.361
I don't want to see another
turkey until Christmas.

33:20.932 --> 33:22.263
Hi, guys.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.166
Listen, I've made up my mind.

33:28.206 --> 33:29.969
I'm going to go
through with it. Tonight.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.670
Donna, that's a big decision,

33:32.710 --> 33:34.644
but if you're really sure,
I'm happy for you.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.078
I am sure.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.810
I mean, Joe is such a wonderful
guy, don't you think?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.977
Yeah. I got to know him
a lot better today.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.077
And I changed my mind.

33:43.121 --> 33:44.554
I think he's a good guy.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.489
Thanks.

33:46.524 --> 33:47.991
I'm kind of nervous though.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.458
Everybody is.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.429
But it's gonna be a
wonderful thing, you'll see.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.727
Especially between two
people like you and Joe.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.166
Yeah.

33:58.569 --> 33:59.558
Hey, Kel.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.631
Looks like the party's

34:02.673 --> 34:03.935
almost over.
What're you gonna do?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.669
Oh, I don't really feel
like going home.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.041
Well, where do you want to go?

34:07.078 --> 34:10.309
I don't know, we could
go someplace quiet and hang out.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.942
Well, it just so happens I have
the house to myself tonight.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.009
There's a horror marathon on TV.
What do you say?

34:17.989 --> 34:19.149
Perfect.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.350
I'll follow you.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.739
Thanks for everything today.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.938
I know my mom drove you nuts,
but you really made her day.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.172
Well, if it wasn't for her,

34:42.213 --> 34:44.647
we would have been
eating Chinese food.

34:47.051 --> 34:49.746
Turn off the light.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.415
What, are you actually planning
on staying here tonight?

34:52.456 --> 34:54.152
It's okay, isn't it?

34:56.494 --> 34:58.325
What, are you kidding?

34:58.362 --> 35:01.195
Well, good, because I'm too
exhausted to drive home.

35:01.232 --> 35:04.599
I thought you said
my bed was lumpy.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.934
Well, it is,
but I'll manage.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.064
Besides, I think Brandon

35:10.108 --> 35:11.871
wants to have the house
to himself tonight.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.137
Why?

35:13.177 --> 35:14.906
Well, I think he wants
to spend some time alone.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.379
You know, these
past couple days

35:16.414 --> 35:18.644
we've had a house full
of people.

35:18.683 --> 35:21.675
Or, maybe he doesn't plan on
spending the night alone.

35:21.719 --> 35:22.811
What?

35:22.854 --> 35:24.253
Oh, come on, Brandon and Kelly

35:24.288 --> 35:25.516
have been circling each other

35:25.556 --> 35:27.251
since Colin and Susan
left for New York.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.623
Well, I haven't noticed.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.685
I've been too busy worrying
about turkey and trimmings.

35:33.831 --> 35:35.696
Do you think everybody
had fun today?

35:35.733 --> 35:38.668
What, are you kidding, this was
the best Thanksgiving yet.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.671
Good.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.730
'Cause you guys
are my family now,

35:42.773 --> 35:45.071
and I wanted my family
to have a good holiday.

35:45.109 --> 35:47.304
Well, you definitely
pulled it off.

35:47.345 --> 35:48.403
Thanks.

35:48.446 --> 35:50.880
You know, one more thing,

35:50.915 --> 35:53.850
and this will be the perfect
Thanksgiving.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.649
What would that be?

35:56.687 --> 35:58.951
Make love to me?

35:58.990 --> 36:02.426
There's nothing else
I'd rather do.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.104
I cannot believe
you're eating more turkey

36:19.143 --> 36:20.371
after what we finished today.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.470
It's a Walsh tradition.

36:22.513 --> 36:25.949
Turkey sandwiches at 11:00
on Thanksgiving night.

36:25.983 --> 36:27.575
And turkey soup for a week.

36:27.618 --> 36:29.210
Whatever.

36:29.253 --> 36:30.686
Hey, bring it into
the living room.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.052
Let's watch that movie.

36:32.089 --> 36:33.317
Kel, um...

36:34.859 --> 36:37.453
whatever happened between us?

36:37.495 --> 36:41.192
That's a hard question.

36:41.232 --> 36:44.690
I guess we should just chalk
it up to bad timing, huh?

36:44.735 --> 36:48.535
Beyond that, it just
gets too complicated.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.871
It was more than that.

36:50.908 --> 36:55.072
I knew that if I made a choice
between you and Dylan,

36:55.112 --> 36:57.205
it would've ruined
your friendship.

36:57.248 --> 37:00.183
So you did the honorable thing.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.154
Yep, but now Dylan's gone.

37:04.188 --> 37:05.587
I noticed.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.818
And I... have Colin.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.325
And I have Susan.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.294
And they have feelings, too.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.063
So, I guess that means

37:14.098 --> 37:16.293
that we're both going to do
the honorable thing, huh?

37:16.334 --> 37:18.962
Would you have it any other way?

37:23.040 --> 37:24.029
No.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.737
Come on.

37:27.778 --> 37:30.941
The Bride of
Fra <i>n</i> ke <i>n</i> stei <i>n</i> awaits.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.246
You know, if we stay up
late watching a movie,

37:33.284 --> 37:35.479
I'm not going to feel
much like driving home.

37:35.519 --> 37:37.680
So can I crash here?

37:37.722 --> 37:39.849
That's going to make it
a little more difficult

37:39.890 --> 37:40.948
to do the honorable thing.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.549
I'll sleep in Steve's room.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.288
You better lock the door.

37:44.328 --> 37:45.761
I'll take that as a compliment.

37:45.796 --> 37:47.161
You should.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.935
I've had the most
amazing few days.

37:53.971 --> 37:57.566
I caught a pass
from Steve Young. Hello!

37:57.608 --> 38:02.068
I traded quips with
Nobel prize winners.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.411
Maybe I'm doing
something right.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.848
You do a lot of things right.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.182
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.485
Maybe it's time I started
demonstrating my finer things.

38:14.392 --> 38:16.417
Wait a second, I want
to give you something.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.088
What? And how many shots will
it take to get rid of it?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.325
Put your hand out.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.798
Okay, now this is something

38:22.833 --> 38:24.425
that's very important
to me, okay?

38:24.468 --> 38:25.867
But I want you to have it.

38:25.903 --> 38:27.598
What is this?

38:27.638 --> 38:28.935
Clare, you're not in a sorority.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.098
It's not for a sorority.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.701
It's my Phi Beta Kappa Key.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.040
Honor society.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.444
I want you to have it.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.576
Well, I feel like that
scarecrow getting a diploma.

38:40.618 --> 38:42.552
Usually I feel like
the flying monkey,

38:42.586 --> 38:44.816
but today I guess I get
a brain, huh?

38:44.855 --> 38:46.413
You have a brain.

38:46.457 --> 38:48.891
And now you have
the key to prove it.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.520
Thanks, Clare.

38:51.562 --> 38:53.496
You earned it.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.431
You really believe in me?

38:55.466 --> 38:57.832
Yeah, I do.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.743
This was definitely the best
birthday I've ever had.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.145
Thank you.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.309
Yeah, well, it's not over yet.

39:19.123 --> 39:23.423
Joe, I want to be
with you tonight.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.790
Wait a minute.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.632
What?

39:32.670 --> 39:34.763
I knew that I liked
you a lot, Donna.

39:34.805 --> 39:38.741
But after today, after all
you've done for me...

39:38.776 --> 39:41.802
I now know that
I'm crazy about you.

39:41.846 --> 39:44.041
Good.

39:44.081 --> 39:45.946
'Cause I'm crazy about you, too.

39:46.016 --> 39:50.953
And that's why
I have to say this,

39:50.988 --> 39:54.890
before we get any closer,
before this goes too far.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.085
What?

39:56.127 --> 39:57.594
What's the matter?

39:57.628 --> 40:03.624
I haven't felt this way about
someone in a... a long time.

40:03.667 --> 40:06.192
Maybe ever.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.568
So why is that a problem?

40:07.605 --> 40:11.701
Because, Donna, I, um...

40:12.977 --> 40:19.507
Look Joe, whatever
it is I'll understand.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.710
All right.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.413
Then, I'll just come
right out with it.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.449
Donna, I don't believe
in premarital sex.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.482
What?

40:29.527 --> 40:32.462
I know that sounds
incredibly square.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.396
And, uh, you know,
if that's too much

40:34.432 --> 40:38.198
for you to handle then,
then I totally understand.

40:38.235 --> 40:43.332
Wait, let me get this straight,
you have no sexual history?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.774
None to speak of.

40:45.810 --> 40:49.109
You're not gonna believe this.

40:49.146 --> 40:50.204
What?

40:50.247 --> 40:52.112
Me either.

40:52.149 --> 40:55.016
Me either, what?

40:55.119 --> 40:57.713
Me either that I don't
have any sexual history.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.583
I don't believe
in premarital sex.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.285
But you just said...

41:02.326 --> 41:04.089
I know, and I meant it.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.427
I guess part of me just thought
that I might lose you

41:07.465 --> 41:09.160
if I didn't sleep with you.

41:11.836 --> 41:12.962
Donna,

41:13.003 --> 41:14.766
that is the most

41:14.805 --> 41:17.672
wonderful thing anyone
has ever said to me.

41:55.312 --> 41:56.506
Hi.

41:56.547 --> 41:58.515
Good morning.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.107
I didn't know you were up.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.879
I've been up for hours.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.887
- I'm going to get the paper.
- Already got it.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.412
And I have coffee.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.391
Well, I hope it's strong.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.518
I have two days
to finish all the work

42:10.561 --> 42:13.291
I've been putting
off all weekend.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.957
So when's Colin getting back?

42:14.999 --> 42:16.899
Sunday.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.868
How about Susan?

42:18.903 --> 42:20.029
Same.

42:21.872 --> 42:25.467
You know, sometimes...

42:25.509 --> 42:28.945
I really hate being
such a good guy.

42:28.979 --> 42:32.710
Well, this shouldn't
be one of those times.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.383
We did the right thing, Brandon.

42:36.420 --> 42:40.186
Yeah, I know.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.721
What was that for?

42:44.762 --> 42:46.821
Nothing.

42:46.864 --> 42:50.960
Just for being you, that's all.

42:54.471 --> 42:55.938
That's nice.

42:56.305 --> 43:02.291
