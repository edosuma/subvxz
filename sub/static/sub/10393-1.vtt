00:05.573 --> 00:09.376
It's easily the most contentious
piece of real estate

00:09.377 --> 00:09.910
in the world.

00:09.911 --> 00:11.611
And there's no hope, none, of

00:11.612 --> 00:18.618
ever talking about it without
pissing somebody, if not

00:18.619 --> 00:19.320
everybody off.

00:19.321 --> 00:20.720
Maybe that's why it's taken me

00:20.721 --> 00:21.821
so long to come here, a place

00:21.822 --> 00:23.456
where even the names of ordinary

00:23.457 --> 00:27.094
things are ferociously disputed.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.262
Where does falafel come from?

00:29.263 --> 00:31.264
Who makes the best hummus?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.999
Is it a fence or a wall?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.767
By the end of this hour, I'll be

00:34.768 --> 00:37.670
seen by many as a terrorist

00:37.671 --> 00:40.607
sympathizer, a Zionist tool, a

00:40.608 --> 00:42.809
self-hating Jew, an apologist

00:42.810 --> 00:44.844
for American imperialism, an

00:44.845 --> 00:50.083
orientalist, socialist,
fascist, CIA agent, and worse.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.085
So here goes nothing.

♪

02:00.021 --> 02:01.521
I was raised without religion.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.991
One side of the family long
ago, catholic... I think.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.194
The other side, Jewish.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.429
I've never been in a synagogue.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.331
I don't believe in
a higher power.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.032
But that doesn't make me any

02:12.033 --> 02:15.034
less Jewish, I don't think.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.838
These guys sandbagging me at the

02:18.839 --> 02:23.210
wailing wall, they don't
seem to think so either.

02:23.211 --> 02:23.944
Only half.

02:23.945 --> 02:27.914
Jewish?

02:27.915 --> 02:33.220
Yes.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.221
You a righty?

02:34.222 --> 02:42.222
I'm a righty, yes.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.949
Mazel tov.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.319
Mazel tov.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.987
Thank you, gentlemen.

03:07.988 --> 03:12.992
I've never felt so much like
I'm macerating as

03:12.993 --> 03:13.993
something I'm not.

03:13.994 --> 03:20.267
I am instinctively hostile
to any kind of devotion.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.601
Certainty is any enemy.

03:21.602 --> 03:26.273
I'm all about doubt, questioning

03:26.274 --> 03:27.607
ones self and the
nature of reality.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.108
When they grabbed hold of me and

03:29.109 --> 03:32.779
in a totally nonjudgmental way

03:32.780 --> 03:36.816
essentially... god's happy
to have you, here you go.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.318
Oh, man.

03:37.319 --> 03:41.954
My treachery is complete.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.123
Just because I was raised
outside the faith with no

03:44.124 --> 03:46.259
particular attachment or loyalty

03:46.260 --> 03:47.360
to Israel doesn't mean that

03:47.361 --> 03:50.029
plenty of people on this earth

03:50.030 --> 03:52.499
don't hate me in principle.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.301
I know that.

03:53.302 --> 03:55.201
But the state of Israel, I never

03:55.202 --> 04:03.202
really knew what to think.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.812
First look around, it's like

04:05.813 --> 04:06.846
everybody says... it's pretty.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.147
It's awesome.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.650
It's urban.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.651
Sophisticated.

04:11.652 --> 04:11.885
Hip.

04:11.886 --> 04:15.688
Like Southern California.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.725
Only nicer.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.860
Then you see the undraftees in

04:20.861 --> 04:27.500
the streets and you
start to get the idea.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.035
This is Jerusalem.

04:28.036 --> 04:31.838
I'm taking you through
Damascus gate, which is one of

04:31.839 --> 04:33.740
the gates to the old city.

04:33.741 --> 04:37.377
These walls are pretty ancient.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.179
People say they go
back to king David.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.415
As history progressed,
they built up the wall.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.385
So the top bed is the newest.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.420
And by newest you mean...

04:47.421 --> 04:49.722
Up to about the ottoman time.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.192
The Turks left here
about 150 years ago.

04:53.193 --> 04:56.363
And the Brits came and
they conquered us.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.097
I wasn't here.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.867
Born here, now cooking in

05:00.868 --> 05:03.035
London, he is the widely known

05:03.036 --> 05:06.739
respected chef and co-author
of the book "Jerusalem."

05:06.740 --> 05:10.109
Basically, this city was

05:10.110 --> 05:11.611
divided into two until 1967 when

05:11.612 --> 05:14.714
there was the
famous six-day war.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.115
Yep.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.550
And the hall that we're

05:17.551 --> 05:19.552
traveling in now, walking
in is east Jerusalem.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.087
It's the Palestinian part.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.957
That was up until '67
belonged to Jordan.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.727
So now it's under
Israeli control.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.530
Very controversial because for

05:30.531 --> 05:34.200
the Jews, for the Israelis,
the city has been unified.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.402
But for the Palestinian, they

05:35.403 --> 05:42.041
are under occupation, as
far as they are concerned.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.043
We just have to go for a falafel

05:44.044 --> 05:46.212
because it's so much part
of the culture here.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.747
Again, contentious because Jews

05:47.748 --> 05:49.449
or Israelis make falafel their

05:49.450 --> 05:51.117
own and everybody in the world

05:51.118 --> 05:57.457
thinks falafel is
an Israeli food.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.892
It's been done for
generations here.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.929
And here, you get falafel
that's just been fried.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.497
You don't get it any other way.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.965
When I come to a place like

06:05.966 --> 06:08.100
that, I see there's a few left

06:08.101 --> 06:09.902
from the previous customer,
I don't take that.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.438
I want them to fry them for me.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.606
That makes all the
difference in the world.

06:13.607 --> 06:17.510
A whole different
animal, isn't it?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.779
So is there a historically

06:19.780 --> 06:21.448
provable answer to
who invented it?

06:21.449 --> 06:22.515
Who made it first.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.616
The one thing that's very clear

06:23.617 --> 06:25.752
in this part of the world,

06:25.753 --> 06:27.754
Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, it's

06:27.755 --> 06:31.023
been cooked for many,
many, many generations.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.825
On the other hand, you get Jews

06:31.826 --> 06:35.327
from Yemen coming here...
They say hey, my great uncle

06:35.328 --> 06:36.796
was in Syria at the time.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.966
Hey, I remember distinctly
so there is actually no

06:39.967 --> 06:40.801
answer to it.

06:40.802 --> 06:47.339
But the question of food
appropriation or who owns the

06:47.340 --> 06:48.708
food.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.611
If you go you can go on
arguing about it forever.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.313
The old city is divided
into four quarters.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.148
There is Muslim quarter.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.317
There is a Jewish quarter.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.553
There is a Christian quarter.

07:00.554 --> 07:04.056
And there's an Armenian quarter.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.659
Each one functions
independently, but people that

07:06.660 --> 07:11.030
live in the certain area are
all from that religion.

07:11.031 --> 07:15.201
So here you see these Israeli
flags over this house.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.736
So basically Jews have bought

07:16.737 --> 07:19.171
this house, although it's
in the Muslim quarter.

07:19.172 --> 07:19.973
That's very controversial

07:19.974 --> 07:22.408
because it breaks the separation

07:22.409 --> 07:26.846
that people would normally
expect in this city.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.016
Now we're walking in the steps
of Jesus Christ, right?

07:30.017 --> 07:33.152
As I so often do.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.888
So this is villa de la Rosa,

07:35.889 --> 07:37.824
which is the last trip Jesus did

07:37.825 --> 07:39.325
before he was crucified.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.027
People feel very emotional.

07:40.028 --> 07:41.260
They come here and they feel

07:41.261 --> 07:43.996
like oh, my god, I am walking in

07:43.997 --> 07:46.566
the steps of Muhammad,
David, or Jesus.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.067
It's like Jesus was here.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.002
I feel like I should
be more something.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.338
A little bit more pious?

07:52.339 --> 07:54.373
A little bit.

07:54.374 --> 08:02.374
It's too late for me.

08:03.183 --> 08:03.551
Great.

08:03.552 --> 08:04.917
Get your own crown of thorns?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.386
In answer to the question
what would Jesus wear?

08:07.387 --> 08:11.992
Oh no, that's just wrong.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.401
Israel is bordered by Egypt,

08:22.402 --> 08:25.271
Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.141
In 1967, after the six-day war,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.143
Israel took control of the Gaza

08:31.144 --> 08:35.881
strip, the Sinai peninsula, the

08:35.883 --> 08:38.484
west bank, and east Jerusalem.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.386
In 2003, Israel began
construction on a wall along the

08:41.388 --> 08:44.757
green line representing the

08:44.758 --> 08:45.758
Israeli-Palestinian border.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.894
The wall now
stretches 450 miles.

08:47.895 --> 08:52.431
When completed, it
will span 700 miles.

08:52.432 --> 08:56.669
85% of it in
Palestinian territory.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.070
On one hand, there's no doubt

08:58.071 --> 09:02.341
that the number of suicide
bombings fell drastically.

09:02.342 --> 09:08.347
On the other, there's this.

09:08.348 --> 09:12.418
You cross from Jerusalem
into the west bank.

09:12.419 --> 09:20.419
Also called Judea, Sumaria,
also called Palestine.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.762
Since 1967, half a million

09:22.763 --> 09:27.667
settlers have moved here, all in

09:27.668 --> 09:30.870
contravention of
international law.

09:30.871 --> 09:35.474
Many in contravention
of international law.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.409
Though it seems to make
little difference.

09:36.410 --> 09:42.048
They're here and in
ever-larger numbers.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.351
This is one of our drivers from

09:45.352 --> 09:46.319
Tel Aviv who I asked about

09:46.320 --> 09:48.921
graffiti on this house
near the settlements.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.356
So what is price tagging?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.960
Something happens in a
settlement or some attack with

09:53.961 --> 09:55.527
Jews, kids from the settlement

09:55.528 --> 09:58.064
would come and have a price
tag for every activity.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.899
So they come to a village like

09:59.900 --> 10:02.068
this, they will destroy cars,

10:02.069 --> 10:04.436
they will write on
walls like this.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.673
It says against Arabs, the state

10:06.674 --> 10:09.241
of Israel is alive, and
death to the Arabs.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.877
Intimidating.

10:10.878 --> 10:17.083
I mean, you put two targets
on my house, I'm moving.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.918
This is Ellie, a settlement with

10:18.919 --> 10:21.353
a population of over 3,000,

10:21.354 --> 10:25.892
relatively isolated from
the rest of Israel.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.094
This is the chief executive of

10:28.095 --> 10:31.197
the settlement and its
former head of security.

10:31.198 --> 10:36.669
Here you see from up
above most of our town.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.071
You see the Palestinian
villages all around.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.539
It's an unusual situation.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.874
A lot of your neighbors would

10:41.875 --> 10:43.976
very much like you
to not be here.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.044
I know most of them.

10:45.045 --> 10:50.582
And most of them, they are
happy that we're here.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.884
Because we... actually we gave

10:51.885 --> 10:55.855
them prosperity for
the first 45 years.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.057
Wherever the PLO
came, they lost it.

10:58.058 --> 11:04.363
I'm guessing a lot of people
would disagree with that

11:04.364 --> 11:06.632
statement.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.234
Radars and cameras.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.470
So from the high ground, you

11:11.471 --> 11:13.072
can see anybody
walking at night.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.274
You could see from
pretty far out.

11:15.275 --> 11:15.976
Definitely.

11:15.977 --> 11:18.978
Could you identify
them after the fact?

11:18.979 --> 11:19.813
Depends.

11:19.814 --> 11:23.983
What we have are protocols
that we work with.

11:23.984 --> 11:31.984
And we had our successes.

11:33.426 --> 11:38.497
We drive to another
settlement a few miles away.

11:38.498 --> 11:42.902
Hot, sun-bleached,
suburban feeling.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.238
Behind its ring of electronic
surveillance censors and

11:46.239 --> 11:49.842
security, everything
they feel they need.

11:49.843 --> 11:57.843
A school, public transportation,
and a petting zoo.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.929
He has lived here for ten years.

12:09.930 --> 12:17.930
He's a wine maker
and amateur cook.

12:21.775 --> 12:29.281
You're not kidding around.

12:29.282 --> 12:33.719
The salmon is marinated with

12:33.720 --> 12:35.221
pomegranate juice that... on the

12:35.222 --> 12:37.223
season, I squeeze pomegranates.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.726
I freeze the juice so I'll
have it all year round.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.061
Where were you before here?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.162
I was born in Pennsylvania.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.365
So your parents brought
you over at age 4?

12:46.366 --> 12:47.167
Yeah.

12:47.168 --> 12:52.138
Kids living in the relative
comfort and familiarity of

12:52.139 --> 12:52.572
Pennsylvania.

12:52.573 --> 12:53.906
Heading off to what must have,

12:53.907 --> 12:55.875
at least in part of their mind,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.810
would seem an uncertain.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.378
Yes.

12:58.379 --> 12:59.578
It was very difficult for them.

12:59.579 --> 13:04.216
Almost all Jews say next year,

13:04.217 --> 13:08.587
it's part of prayers that
we say all the time.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.689
The Bible, it's all right there.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.360
It all happened here.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.662
That's sort of a
nonnegotiable position.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.097
You see prophesies coming true.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.531
Things coming to life.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.599
Mountains that nobody wanted to

13:20.600 --> 13:22.368
live on, nobody dared to... for

13:22.369 --> 13:24.570
thousands of years,
nobody wanted this place.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.573
And then finally, we come here

13:27.574 --> 13:30.209
and everything is
flourishing again.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.611
It makes you feel
good, you know?

13:32.612 --> 13:37.749
You've been here since '90.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.887
You look over the edge
there, an Arab village.

13:40.888 --> 13:41.454
Yeah.

13:41.455 --> 13:43.722
There is one that you
can see from here.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.957
At any point during that

13:44.958 --> 13:46.625
time, you ever go to anybody's

13:46.626 --> 13:47.726
house, sit down and eat?

13:47.727 --> 13:50.963
Not there, but in
other villages.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.699
Ever sat down at a Muslim table?

13:53.700 --> 13:58.104
Muslim table... you host
and everybody else...

13:58.105 --> 13:58.638
Coffee.

13:58.639 --> 13:59.906
But not there.

13:59.907 --> 14:06.913
No, because as a religious
Jew, I eat only kosher.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.315
So they respect that.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.951
So they don't offer me.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.620
So I've got to ask you about

14:14.621 --> 14:16.222
something that troubled me.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.490
Coming up, the first house

14:18.491 --> 14:21.593
before you come up the drive to

14:21.594 --> 14:26.598
this village, the graffiti
on the front... yes.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.168
The targets spray painted on.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.003
Yes.

14:30.004 --> 14:32.804
Whodunit?

14:32.805 --> 14:34.340
Villains.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.507
Bad people.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.643
Kids?

14:37.644 --> 14:41.280
I don't know.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.015
Apparently kids.

14:42.016 --> 14:45.651
When we educate kids, kids
are not able to understand

14:45.652 --> 14:46.519
complicated things.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.354
They see the world
in black and white.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.823
When you get older, you're
able to see the gray.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.625
And when someone hits you...

14:53.626 --> 14:56.762
I understand why
kids would do it.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.465
Given what you told me earlier,

14:59.466 --> 15:03.002
identifying the perpetrators

15:03.003 --> 15:11.003
within the realm of possibility?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.386
They're young people.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.454
Why not paint it over?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.390
Good question.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.291
Maybe we should.

15:24.291 --> 15:24.824
You're right.

15:24.825 --> 15:27.059
Elsewhere in the west bank,

15:27.060 --> 15:35.060
just outside of Ramallah
meet Betty and Mona.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.577
Two members of a group of women

15:45.578 --> 15:48.647
who call themselves
the speed sisters.

15:48.648 --> 15:56.648
The first all-female
Palestinian racing team.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.593
Hi.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.362
I'm Tony.

16:02.363 --> 16:10.069
Good to meet you.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.039
When I'm riding a car, I'm
the happiest girl ever.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.440
Racing, it's in my blood.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.442
Here in Palestine,
it's very small.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.377
There's no roads.

16:17.378 --> 16:22.581
So when I drive, I speed.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.051
I feel free.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.786
Do you find that people
underestimated you at first?

16:27.787 --> 16:30.689
At the beginning, they could
maybe make fun of us.

16:30.690 --> 16:36.695
But when we got good
scores... yeah.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.797
A car doesn't know if
you're a woman or a man.

16:38.798 --> 16:43.535
A lot of girls want to
join us as speed sisters.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.971
But some of their families
are very reserved.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.374
Their don't like their daughters

16:48.375 --> 16:49.209
to be between men racing.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.943
Palestine is a very
reserved society.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.745
So are things getting better?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.381
Staying the same, or worse?

16:55.382 --> 16:58.984
You never know what's going
to happen in Palestine.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.087
One day it's good and the other

17:01.088 --> 17:02.754
day it's just... you never know.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.923
It's a crazy country.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.892
The local police would prefer

17:06.893 --> 17:10.662
them off the streets
for obvious reasons.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.598
But the track here, such as
it is, has its drawbacks.

17:13.599 --> 17:19.003
It's basically a parking lot
across from the detention

17:19.005 --> 17:19.339
center.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.006
What do they think
about this next door?

17:21.007 --> 17:23.242
Do they ever give you problems?

17:23.242 --> 17:25.676
This is an Israeli jail.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.246
One time we were here with speed

17:27.247 --> 17:28.947
sisters and there was problems

17:28.948 --> 17:31.317
because of the prisoners.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.320
So I just stopped my car over
there and I was walking.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.256
I wanted to see what's going on.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.857
And the Israeli soldiers, they

17:38.858 --> 17:41.760
came running at me and
they start shooting at me.

17:41.761 --> 17:47.599
And I got shot in the back.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
It was tear gas.

17:48.601 --> 17:53.205
So my speed sisters, they
took me to the hospital.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.141
I fainted.

17:54.142 --> 17:56.942
Have you thought of challenging
the Israelis to put

17:56.943 --> 17:57.777
up a team?

17:57.778 --> 17:59.878
I can't race because
my car is Palestinian.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.547
What if they come over here?

18:01.548 --> 18:03.048
They're not allowed to enter

18:03.049 --> 18:04.816
the west bank and we're not

18:04.817 --> 18:06.051
allowed to go to Jerusalem, so

18:06.052 --> 18:07.052
how can we race together?

18:07.053 --> 18:11.023
OK, silly question.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.308
It's right there for all to see.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.876
And it feels like something out

18:30.877 --> 18:35.547
of a science fiction film.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.882
This is the wall.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.850
From the other side, from inside

18:38.851 --> 18:41.520
this place, for instance, the

18:41.521 --> 18:43.355
refugee camp in the district of

18:43.356 --> 18:44.590
Bethlehem, it doesn't feel like

18:44.591 --> 18:52.591
anything other than
what it is, a prison.

18:53.566 --> 18:58.704
Abed is the founder of the
children's theatre center.

18:58.705 --> 19:03.375
So we are at the north
entrance of Bethlehem, heading

19:03.376 --> 19:04.376
to the refugee camp.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.246
So this has been
here since 1950.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.447
Yes.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.949
It started with tents.

19:10.950 --> 19:16.755
People were under the tents
for about seven years.

19:16.756 --> 19:24.756
And later, they started
building shelters.

19:26.032 --> 19:31.737
First impressions of the
camp, there's a remarkable

19:31.738 --> 19:32.572
number of kids.

19:32.573 --> 19:36.041
Now it's about 6,000 people.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.377
And 2/3 are under 18 years old.

19:38.378 --> 19:43.249
So it's a very young population.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.983
Unfortunately, with the
continuing degradation of the

19:44.984 --> 19:46.752
political and economic
situation, we are in the

19:46.753 --> 19:51.056
situation where we have
no playgrounds anymore.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.591
Children play in the streets

19:52.592 --> 19:54.926
beneath walls covered in images

19:54.927 --> 20:01.433
of martyrs, plane hijackers,
political prisoners.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.769
6,000 people, of that number,

20:03.770 --> 20:06.505
66% are under the age of 18.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.939
I don't care where that is in

20:07.940 --> 20:11.410
the world, that's pretty much a

20:11.411 --> 20:15.614
recipe for unruly behavior,
I think would be the best.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.848
Well, yes.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.584
Especially when you don't have

20:18.585 --> 20:20.151
any possibilities to evacuate

20:20.152 --> 20:22.488
the anger and the stress
in a creative way.

20:22.489 --> 20:25.424
So after I finished my studies,

20:25.425 --> 20:27.025
I came back here and I started

20:27.026 --> 20:28.960
using theatre as one of the most

20:28.961 --> 20:30.829
amazing, powerful, civilized and

20:30.830 --> 20:32.731
nonviolent means to
express yourself.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.132
To tell your story.

20:34.133 --> 20:34.967
To be truthful.

20:34.968 --> 20:38.770
And this is for me the remedy
to build peace within.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.272
And hopefully help them to think

20:40.273 --> 20:41.973
that they can grow up and change

20:41.974 --> 20:46.812
the world and create miracles.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.148
Without explode themselves.

20:50.149 --> 20:54.152
But to stay alive.

20:54.153 --> 21:02.060
Abed takes me to the
martyrs quarter to be fed.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.496
She offers Palestinian cooking

21:04.497 --> 21:05.664
classes, helping her provide for

21:05.665 --> 21:12.003
six children, one of
whom is disabled.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.204
In America, kids grow up with

21:13.205 --> 21:17.042
pop stars, sports players.

21:17.043 --> 21:20.011
It's unthinkable for a child to

21:20.012 --> 21:21.847
look up to a politician or to

21:21.848 --> 21:25.584
look up to a military figure.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.419
Sports or entertainment.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.355
Here, kids 4 or 5 years old

21:29.356 --> 21:32.190
every day, they're looking at

21:32.191 --> 21:35.727
somebody who, you know,
brought down a plane.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.762
Yeah.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.830
I'm not questioning why that is.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.366
I know.

21:39.367 --> 21:42.100
Do you think it's helpful?

21:42.101 --> 21:47.373
Well, I guess we have a history.

21:47.374 --> 21:52.478
We are people who are
under occupation.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.679
They are heroes.

21:53.680 --> 21:58.183
And their heroes are those
who resist the occupation.

21:58.184 --> 22:03.221
And to tell you the truth,

22:03.222 --> 22:05.256
sometimes I have been with some

22:05.257 --> 22:07.526
political parties, when they put

22:07.527 --> 22:12.731
images of people who are
killed in their houses.

22:12.732 --> 22:18.370
Ahmed's sister, the 29th of

22:18.371 --> 22:19.005
October, 2001, she was killed in

22:19.006 --> 22:22.073
her kitchen by a sniper.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.610
But when these political parties

22:24.611 --> 22:26.412
take this woman and want to make

22:26.413 --> 22:28.914
a montage of photos with her

22:28.915 --> 22:31.750
carrying a gun to say this is

22:31.751 --> 22:34.786
the hero, sorry, this
is not the truth.

22:34.787 --> 22:40.091
This woman was
killed in her house.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.594
We will go today and ask the

22:42.595 --> 22:44.963
Palestinians who
is the great evil?

22:44.964 --> 22:48.600
You ask these kids, who
will they recognize?

22:48.601 --> 22:53.939
They recognize a man from Gaza,

22:53.940 --> 22:57.409
Mohamed Assa, a
singer who sings.

22:57.410 --> 23:04.850
He becomes more famous than
Arafat and everybody else.

23:04.851 --> 23:12.851
This is another image
of these times.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.696
You can almost believe for a

23:17.697 --> 23:21.633
minute or two that some
kind of peace, some kind of

23:21.634 --> 23:23.134
reconciliation, meeting of the

23:23.135 --> 23:27.773
minds, sanity is possible
after you visit Majda.

23:27.774 --> 23:28.974
It's a restaurant in what looks

23:28.975 --> 23:36.548
like an idyllic village
in the Judean hills.

23:36.549 --> 23:43.622
It feels like an alternate
universe for a number of

23:43.623 --> 23:47.993
reasons.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.461
Someone Jewish.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.563
One is Muslim, from
a nearby village.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.700
They're partners, co-owners of

23:54.701 --> 23:56.134
Majda, and also married.

23:56.135 --> 24:00.739
They're unsurprisingly
friends of Yotan.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.840
Together they grow and raise

24:01.841 --> 24:03.742
much of what's used
in their kitchen.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.310
Their food reflects both their

24:05.311 --> 24:12.017
different backgrounds and
their commonalities.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.252
We're going to spoil you now.

24:14.253 --> 24:21.827
Yeah, here you go.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.529
So you grew up in this town.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.531
Yes, in this village.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.198
Where did you grow up?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.200
Near the beach.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.435
Near the beach.

24:30.436 --> 24:31.370
Not the neighborhood.

24:31.371 --> 24:35.607
But we met in the neighborhood.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.076
We work together in hotel.

24:38.077 --> 24:42.180
How did that go down
with the families?

24:42.181 --> 24:42.582
Now wonderful.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.049
In the beginning, not so much.

24:44.050 --> 24:50.388
Started with a lot of questions.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.023
Understand that we love each

24:51.024 --> 24:52.724
other and they can do nothing,

24:52.725 --> 25:00.725
so we continue and
they support us.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.570
This is your special farm eggs.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.637
Farm eggs.

25:05.638 --> 25:09.708
Peppers from your garden?

25:09.709 --> 25:10.209
Tomato.

25:10.210 --> 25:14.245
That looks awesome beyond words.

25:14.246 --> 25:18.116
It is incredibly beautiful here.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.619
I don't know why I
didn't expect that.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.388
A lot of people come and say

25:23.389 --> 25:31.389
it's like Provence,
it's like Italy.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.499
You like it?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.234
I do.

25:35.235 --> 25:39.437
Roasted tomatoes, okra.

25:39.438 --> 25:40.438
Onion and mint.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.273
That's all they do.

25:41.274 --> 25:44.109
What they do a lot here is
char the hell out of it.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.944
So it's really smoky just from

25:45.945 --> 25:52.751
being in the pan
on very high heat.

25:52.752 --> 25:58.423
So generally speaking,
who lives in this area?

25:58.424 --> 26:03.929
Mostly Arab... ethnically
Arab in this part of town?

26:03.930 --> 26:11.930
I'm the only Jewish in...
Hardly any Jewish in the

26:12.839 --> 26:13.105
village.

26:13.106 --> 26:15.106
Zucchini that's been grilled.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.610
Then we use fried yogurt,
so that's the sauce.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.846
That's the go-to flavor.

26:20.847 --> 26:25.717
Very typical for
Palestinian cooking.

26:25.718 --> 26:26.485
It's good.

26:26.486 --> 26:30.121
I just had this incredibly
delicious meal completely

26:30.122 --> 26:33.324
oblivious to the fact that
it's entirely vegetarian.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.560
If any of the vegetarian

26:35.561 --> 26:37.195
restaurants in New York served

26:37.196 --> 26:45.196
food that tasted like this,
I would actually go there.

26:46.405 --> 26:52.310
I'd consider it.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.747
Fried zucchini with mint.

26:55.748 --> 26:59.885
And little sweet apricots.

26:59.886 --> 27:00.687
It's delicious.

27:00.688 --> 27:01.688
Are you hopeful?

27:01.688 --> 27:02.488
Of course.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.355
I have my children.

27:03.356 --> 27:08.694
I need to say that.

27:08.695 --> 27:12.831
Together we can build
something for our kids.

27:12.832 --> 27:13.766
Our future.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.333
That's what we think and that's

27:15.334 --> 27:18.870
what we give the message
for our customers.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.339
The fact that it actually

27:21.340 --> 27:22.774
manages to do whatnot so many

27:22.775 --> 27:25.010
chefs try to do here, and that

27:25.011 --> 27:29.080
is sort of mix the Jewish
ethnicity or background with

27:29.081 --> 27:33.419
Arab food.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.228
Getting out of Gaza from

27:43.229 --> 27:45.430
Israel is truly one of the most

27:45.431 --> 27:47.365
surreal travel experiences
you have on earth.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.368
Over 1.5 million
people live in Gaza.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.637
Most of them
considered refugees.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.105
Meaning they're not from the

27:54.106 --> 27:56.241
place they're compelled
to live now.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.576
In most cases, they're either

27:58.577 --> 28:02.347
prohibited from or
unable to leave.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.483
Israel decides who
comes and goes.

28:05.484 --> 28:09.320
What gets in and what stays out.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.090
Apart from journalists, aid

28:12.091 --> 28:14.459
workers, emergency responders,

28:14.460 --> 28:17.829
very few people are allowed
to cross into Gaza.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.298
In 2005, the Israeli defense

28:20.299 --> 28:22.000
forces left the Gaza strip and

28:22.001 --> 28:28.439
all Israeli settlers
were removed.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.777
Now inside Gaza,
Hamas is in charge.

28:31.778 --> 28:34.145
Considered a terrorist
organization by both the united

28:34.146 --> 28:42.146
states and Israel, they
got elected in 2006.

28:52.531 --> 28:56.001
This is Laila Hadan, a native

28:56.002 --> 29:04.002
Gazan, journalist and author
of "the Gaza kitchen."

29:05.611 --> 29:07.212
They're not as big as they

29:07.213 --> 29:08.814
used to be, that's primarily

29:08.815 --> 29:13.018
because the fishermen can't go

29:13.019 --> 29:14.519
beyond three to six
nautical miles.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.687
If you go beyond, what happens?

29:16.688 --> 29:19.224
They'll shoot at the fishermen,
destroy their boats,

29:19.225 --> 29:21.893
cut their fishing nets,
they'll detain them.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.195
It's obviously really
risky business.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.230
Nine nautical miles, that's

29:25.231 --> 29:26.497
where that deep sea channel is

29:26.498 --> 29:31.536
where you're going to get
the really good catches.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.138
Gaza is the last Palestinian

29:32.139 --> 29:33.404
area with access to the coast.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.640
That's really important
to remember.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.808
You have the west bank just an

29:36.809 --> 29:39.744
hour away, but many of the

29:39.745 --> 29:40.379
Palestinians, they have never

29:40.380 --> 29:48.253
seen the sea, have
never been to the sea.

29:48.254 --> 29:52.023
The family owns a small farm

29:52.024 --> 29:53.524
in the eastern Gaza strip.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.426
She and her husband are unusual

29:55.427 --> 29:57.595
in that they cook together.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.430
This is not typical in this part

29:59.431 --> 30:02.767
of the world or in this culture.

30:02.768 --> 30:06.704
They use their own fresh-killed

30:06.705 --> 30:08.874
chickens to make
the Gazan classic.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.441
The traditional Palestinian dish

30:10.442 --> 30:12.010
comprised of layers of fried

30:12.011 --> 30:15.947
eggplant, tomato, potatoes,
Caramelized onions, and

30:15.948 --> 30:22.520
chicken sauteed, them simmered
in a broth with nutmeg,

30:22.521 --> 30:24.789
cinnamon, cardimum, and rice.

30:24.790 --> 30:27.092
It's a big family.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.393
Children, grandchildren all

30:28.394 --> 30:35.266
living under the same roof,
and it can get chaotic.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.136
So let's talk about
food and eat food.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.470
Yeah, yeah, sure.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.739
What do we have here?

30:41.740 --> 30:46.711
This is called mahmouba.

30:46.712 --> 30:52.450
Traditionally lamb,
in this case chicken.

30:52.451 --> 30:57.122
They're very concerned that
we're being very rude.

30:57.123 --> 31:05.123
We're not allowing
the others to eat.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.267
Wow.

31:09.268 --> 31:16.674
For me, being from Gaza,
being a child of Diaspora, I

31:16.675 --> 31:19.344
always thought food was an
interesting way to tell the

31:19.345 --> 31:19.912
Palestinian story.

31:19.913 --> 31:22.280
Being able to discover this lost

31:22.281 --> 31:23.514
history, this Palestinian past.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.817
Plus, the food is
really dang good.

31:26.818 --> 31:27.852
That it is.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.521
I think it was also important
to be able to provide

31:30.522 --> 31:31.689
Palestinians an image of

31:31.690 --> 31:32.591
themselves that they recognize,

31:32.592 --> 31:34.759
a very humane image, because all

31:34.760 --> 31:36.194
they're seeing in the media,

31:36.195 --> 31:38.196
whether here or there, whether

31:38.197 --> 31:40.498
on Arabic channels or abroad,

31:40.499 --> 31:42.367
you know, is this kind of very

31:42.368 --> 31:46.771
caricatured images of gunned men

31:46.772 --> 31:50.508
and this kind of grim
cinder block landscape.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.778
You're not entering
into the private homes.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.113
What does a kitchen look like,

31:55.114 --> 32:00.418
or what does a
family you see here.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.320
Do you like it, she's asking?

32:02.321 --> 32:06.724
Absolutely delicious.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.893
Really, really good.

32:08.894 --> 32:09.528
Yeah?

32:09.529 --> 32:12.230
She wants you to open
a restaurant for her.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.133
Keep cooking like this.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.567
It's really delicious.

32:16.568 --> 32:20.571
Gaza has three distinctive
culinary heritage.

32:20.572 --> 32:21.307
Those who hail from villages

32:21.308 --> 32:25.743
that were either depopulated
or destroyed in 1948.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.146
And they constitute about 75% of

32:28.147 --> 32:29.247
the population of Gaza.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.915
And they kind of bring with them

32:30.916 --> 32:33.851
their own distinct cuisine.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.486
That's very different from the

32:35.487 --> 32:37.222
cuisine of the city, Gaza city,

32:37.223 --> 32:39.057
which tends to use much more

32:39.058 --> 32:41.692
heat, much more chili peppers,

32:41.693 --> 32:43.161
from the cuisine of the coast,

32:43.162 --> 32:47.732
which is rich with seafood,
of course, and a very

32:47.733 --> 32:52.170
sophisticated, very
urbane cuisine.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.271
I guess the first question

32:53.272 --> 32:57.942
would be, in your lifetime, will

32:57.943 --> 33:03.181
you be able to visit Yahba?

33:03.182 --> 33:04.615
She says she hopes she can.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.918
She also hopes she can
go to Jerusalem as well.

33:07.919 --> 33:15.919
So she's optimistic.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.363
She's saying... first she said

33:18.364 --> 33:20.765
you're not allowing us to.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.233
Then corrected and said the

33:22.234 --> 33:23.434
Israelis aren't allowing us.

33:23.435 --> 33:31.435
Go, go.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.982
This is a normal tone of voice.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.384
Not upset, by the way.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.252
This is how we talk.

33:40.252 --> 33:40.786
We yell.

33:40.787 --> 33:41.986
What's he saying?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.254
Give me a permit.

33:43.255 --> 33:48.127
If they allow, of
course I'll go.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.480
Laila's got something
to show me.

34:09.481 --> 34:15.620
A watermelon salad she
discovered on her recent trip

34:15.621 --> 34:16.522
here that's really
piqued her interest.

34:16.522 --> 34:16.922
So off we go.

34:16.922 --> 34:23.460
This will take a minute.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.295
We arrive at what looks like a

34:25.297 --> 34:29.199
pretty serious gathering.

34:29.201 --> 34:32.603
This is a Duwan, and we're soon

34:32.603 --> 34:34.105
joined by her husband Abu.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.306
It's an area where the elders

34:36.308 --> 34:38.809
gather to, you know, resolve

34:38.810 --> 34:42.547
community problems,
to kind of advise.

34:42.547 --> 34:46.984
All these guys are originally

34:46.985 --> 34:48.853
from an area now part of Israel,

34:48.853 --> 34:50.221
so they're bound together by

34:50.222 --> 34:51.656
traditions and a way of life

34:51.657 --> 34:52.657
very different from here, where

34:52.658 --> 34:56.060
they've been relocated
and lived since 1948.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.362
Does he think he'll be able to

34:57.363 --> 35:00.165
go to his ancestral homeland in

35:00.166 --> 35:05.870
his lifetime, his
children's lifetime?

35:05.871 --> 35:13.644
What's his guess?

35:13.645 --> 35:16.347
This enemy.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.417
And we understand that.

35:19.418 --> 35:23.521
We hope.

35:23.522 --> 35:28.092
Me, my son.

35:28.093 --> 35:32.563
My daughter.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.200
So what they're making now...

35:35.201 --> 35:39.036
It's basically baby watermelon,
underripe watermelon.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.705
This is sort of a specialty of

35:40.706 --> 35:44.575
Southern Gaza, but also Sinai.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.878
It's usually something that's

35:47.879 --> 35:50.381
made specifically by
men, I was told here.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.682
You can see they're fire

35:51.683 --> 35:53.218
roasting the baby watermelons.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.253
They cover them
with aluminum foil.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.454
They put them through a wire,

35:56.455 --> 36:01.726
kind of like a rustic skewer.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.428
And then they just
throw them in there.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.396
And the idea is that they take

36:05.397 --> 36:11.736
the pulp out, so that's
what's going on.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.271
And then what they do while

36:13.272 --> 36:17.041
that's fire roasting is they

36:17.042 --> 36:20.211
knead an unlevined dough over

36:20.212 --> 36:22.280
there with whole-wheat, barley,

36:22.281 --> 36:26.751
plenty of rich, extra
virgin olive oil.

36:26.752 --> 36:27.985
And then they throw that into

36:27.986 --> 36:29.620
the pit as well, or they dig a

36:29.621 --> 36:31.989
pit in the sand over there.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.090
Right in the coals?

36:33.091 --> 36:34.091
Yep.

36:34.092 --> 36:40.431
And they mix that all together.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.267
So it's interesting.

36:41.268 --> 36:43.100
Because right now, we're about,

36:43.101 --> 36:46.170
what, 35 minutes
away from Gaza city.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.006
Ask anyone in Gaza city if

36:49.007 --> 36:53.511
they've heard of
this dish and, no.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.513
So even in an area as small as

36:55.514 --> 36:57.615
Gaza, you see this
very wide variation.

36:57.616 --> 37:05.257
They're going to clean it up.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.541
Many, if not most of these

37:23.542 --> 37:25.710
guys, are not too sympathetic to

37:25.711 --> 37:28.979
my country or my
ethnicity, I'm guessing.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.683
But there's that
hospitality thing.

37:32.684 --> 37:36.721
Anywhere you go in the
Muslim world, it seems.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.889
You feed your guests and do your

37:38.890 --> 37:39.858
best to make them feel at home.

37:39.859 --> 37:44.995
We have to eat.

37:44.996 --> 37:52.996
You're supposed to eat
this with your hands.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.172
Mm, very good.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.808
He's saying if you eat this,

37:57.809 --> 38:01.512
you shouldn't have another
meal for three days.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.314
Where does this dish come from?

38:03.315 --> 38:07.184
This is a dish that's native

38:07.185 --> 38:10.020
to Southern Gaza, the Sinai,

38:10.021 --> 38:12.923
sort of the desert
Bedouin areas.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.692
All the food I've had so far

38:14.693 --> 38:17.094
in Gaza has been very different

38:17.095 --> 38:19.764
than in anything else I've
had in the Arab world.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.333
Different flavor spectrum.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.034
Totally.

38:24.035 --> 38:30.708
It's kind of it's own little
gastronomical bubble.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.543
I find that the food has more

38:32.544 --> 38:40.544
flavor, I get a
better cepsry experience.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.119
They have children, and they

38:42.120 --> 38:44.254
like to eat with their hands.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.693
He's saying god gave us hands
to eat with, not spoons.

39:09.247 --> 39:13.250
One can be forgiven for
thinking, when you see how

39:13.251 --> 39:14.819
similar they are, the two

39:14.820 --> 39:16.587
peoples, both of them cook with

39:16.588 --> 39:18.155
pride, eat with passion, love

39:18.156 --> 39:20.324
their kids, love the land in

39:20.325 --> 39:22.593
which they live or the land they

39:22.594 --> 39:25.563
dream of returning to, who live

39:25.564 --> 39:27.598
so close, who are locked in such

39:27.599 --> 39:30.401
an intimate, if deadly embrace

39:30.402 --> 39:31.936
might somehow, some day, figure

39:31.937 --> 39:34.905
out how to live with each other.

39:34.906 --> 39:38.443
But that would be very
mushy thinking indeed.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.144
Those things in the end probably

39:40.145 --> 39:48.145
don't count for much at all.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.192
Gatan Galkowitz runs a

39:55.193 --> 39:57.294
restaurant just seven miles
from the Gaza strip.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.963
You and your family have paid

39:58.964 --> 40:00.965
the most unbelievable price.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.869
My daughter was killed
by mortar sent by Hamas.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.672
In some Israeli towns and

40:07.673 --> 40:10.140
villages within close proximity

40:10.141 --> 40:11.842
of the Gaza strip, bus stops

40:11.843 --> 40:13.210
double as bomb shelters and air

40:13.211 --> 40:14.812
raid sirens warn of incoming

40:14.813 --> 40:18.315
missiles fired from
less than a mile away.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.985
Rockets and mortar shells have

40:20.986 --> 40:22.987
been known to fall from the sky

40:22.988 --> 40:26.356
in these parts and no one
understands the consequences

40:26.357 --> 40:27.525
more than this man.

40:27.526 --> 40:30.661
You were not a fervent Zionist.

40:30.662 --> 40:31.329
No.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.831
You were not an orthodox Jew.

40:33.832 --> 40:34.666
No.

40:34.667 --> 40:37.702
And yet here you are, at the

40:37.703 --> 40:39.470
spear point, right at the dip.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.238
Here's your restaurant.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.006
There is a shelter.

40:41.006 --> 40:41.573
Here you are.

40:41.574 --> 40:46.877
After the death of my daughter,
I just start to talk,

40:46.878 --> 40:47.878
to whom?

40:47.879 --> 40:51.516
To people who want to listen.

40:51.517 --> 40:55.520
I know that my daughter was

40:55.521 --> 40:58.355
killed for no reason and I know

40:58.356 --> 40:59.257
that people on the other side

40:59.258 --> 41:05.930
have been killed for no reason.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.097
Childrens, old people.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.599
I have been a soldier in Gaza.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.001
I saw very poor people.

41:11.002 --> 41:14.539
I know there is interest in
keeping this poor people.

41:14.540 --> 41:19.209
You can go far, far, but the

41:19.210 --> 41:25.349
bottom line is, let's
stop with the suffering.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.852
You know, I went to
this settler community.

41:27.853 --> 41:28.453
Nice people.

41:28.454 --> 41:31.856
And I said to you, you
know, they were nice.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.625
And you said, you said, you
said, they're all nice.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.893
They're all nice.

41:35.894 --> 41:39.263
I know, nice, very nice
Palestinian people.

41:39.264 --> 41:43.067
They're all nice, but if you

41:43.068 --> 41:45.469
scratch, if you push, they all

41:45.470 --> 41:52.777
want... they'll all say,
throw them in the sea.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.412
Most of the people,
they don't talk.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.814
They are very upset.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.148
They are fed up.

41:58.149 --> 42:03.721
And the same goes from
the other side to us.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.455
You have to find the right

42:05.456 --> 42:08.225
people on both village, also on

42:08.226 --> 42:11.762
the down, also on the up,
and maybe they talk.

42:11.763 --> 42:19.763
And I am sure that is possible.

42:20.405 --> 42:25.109
The opportunities to do that
here are very, very, very

42:25.110 --> 42:26.644
limited, it seemed.

42:26.645 --> 42:27.912
I agree.

42:27.913 --> 42:32.316
And I mean, one doesn't even

42:32.317 --> 42:34.952
have to speak metaphorically,

42:34.953 --> 42:36.954
because there is an actual wall.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.790
Or a fence, depending on
who you're talking to.

42:39.791 --> 42:40.958
Fence or wall.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.459
No, it's a big wall.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.428
It's ugly.

42:43.429 --> 42:44.695
It's really ugly.

42:44.696 --> 42:49.635
You can see it, it's not
far away from here.
