00:10.200 --> 00:12.200
I see stars!

00:21.098 --> 00:21.632
Bart!

01:37.132 --> 01:40.500
<i>Oh, Mardi Gras
Oh, Mardi Gras</i>

01:40.700 --> 01:43.419
<i>You see a lot of boobies</i>

01:43.594 --> 01:45.500
Boy, where are my Zydeco records?

01:46.914 --> 01:49.800
There's twelve more boxes,
and they all sound the same!

01:49.960 --> 01:52.700
I know they do,
but the Simpson Mardi Gras party

01:52.747 --> 01:55.427
has been a tradition since
two days before you were born.

01:55.634 --> 01:57.473
And we spare no expense.

01:57.632 --> 01:58.970
What about my birthday party?

01:59.117 --> 02:00.200
This counts as that.

02:01.334 --> 02:02.854
Ladies, how you
doing with the float?

02:02.919 --> 02:05.130
Fine. But I wish you'd
picked an easier theme

02:05.135 --> 02:07.335
than Super Jet Dinosaur Fun Monkeys.

02:07.407 --> 02:09.110
What does that even mean?

02:09.116 --> 02:11.765
Homie, every year
this party gets a little bigger.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.796
I'm afraid it's growing out of hand.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.570
Hey Homer, I have some distant relatives
that I'd never see except for this party.

02:17.577 --> 02:19.094
Can I bring them to the party?

02:19.255 --> 02:20.090
No problem.

02:20.097 --> 02:23.220
Just so you know, some of them
act like they hate America.

02:23.225 --> 02:25.344
But what they really hate
are Americans.

02:26.257 --> 02:29.334
Marge, lighten up.
Even Grampa's enjoying himself.

02:43.128 --> 02:45.720
I officially declare this private party

02:45.729 --> 02:48.561
in some guy's backyard open!

02:52.271 --> 02:55.700
It's my wife! Everyone, pretend this is
a trade seminar in Zürich.

02:58.500 --> 03:02.408
Can't talk now, dear. It's four in
the morning here in Zürich.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.071
Oh, right. We came together.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.300
Here you go!

03:16.610 --> 03:17.663
Eat my food!

03:17.885 --> 03:19.336
Drink up my drink!

03:19.576 --> 03:21.444
Put your coat on my daughter's bed!

03:21.785 --> 03:23.140
I command you!

03:23.715 --> 03:24.715
Your majesty,

03:24.725 --> 03:27.488
did you remember
to invite Ned Flanders?

03:30.948 --> 03:33.224
As the worm said to
the plate of spaghetti, "I..."

03:36.438 --> 03:37.840
Fine, I'll invite him.

03:37.845 --> 03:40.302
But he has to wear
the outfit I choose.

03:43.421 --> 03:45.430
Hey, Flanders.

03:45.779 --> 03:47.517
Listen, we're having a party...

03:48.802 --> 03:49.700
I noticed.

03:49.773 --> 03:50.741
So anyway,

03:50.967 --> 03:54.235
if you're not doing anything,
and it looks like you are,

03:54.400 --> 03:58.081
you're welcome to stop by.
Or not.

04:01.657 --> 04:04.649
Well, Homer, maybe I could use
a break from the old weed and feed.

04:05.768 --> 04:07.927
Man, you really are into me, huh?

04:07.973 --> 04:11.114
What am I? Some kind of talking dog?

04:11.534 --> 04:12.200
Sure.

04:18.946 --> 04:21.071
Three, two, one.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.000
It's Ash Wednesday, everybody!

04:23.059 --> 04:25.500
Sit down your gins,
and confess your sins.

04:46.729 --> 04:50.260
Homer, I always wonder: How can you
afford this party year after year?

04:50.460 --> 04:54.766
Because I have this magical thing
called a home equity loan.

04:54.890 --> 04:59.080
I borrow all the money I want,
and the house gets stuck with the bill.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.760
Sucker!

05:02.435 --> 05:04.542
Huh. I'm not sure that's how it works.

05:04.616 --> 05:07.653
Fine, Mr. Skeptical.
Give me back your beads.

05:07.715 --> 05:08.370
But, but, but...

05:08.376 --> 05:09.315
Beads, please.

05:19.327 --> 05:21.577
Homie, do you know
anything about this?

05:22.097 --> 05:25.820
Marge, don't worry. It's like when
we stopped paying the phone bill.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.480
They stopped calling us.
In fact, everyone did.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.850
I think we should go
see our mortgage broker.

05:31.317 --> 05:34.864
Oh man, who'd think the first day
of Lent would be such a bummer.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.180
Let's see here. Balloon payment,

05:40.566 --> 05:42.857
37% interest compounded every minute,

05:43.228 --> 05:44.739
not understanding the contract fee...

05:48.325 --> 05:49.823
Here's your new monthly payment.

05:51.025 --> 05:53.500
That number's so big, it has a comma!

05:53.630 --> 05:55.120
Oh wait, I left out a zero.

05:55.715 --> 05:57.850
Listen, you!
When you gave me that money,

05:57.900 --> 06:00.462
you said I wouldn't have to
repay it 'til the future!

06:00.465 --> 06:01.847
This isn't the future!

06:01.993 --> 06:03.670
It's the lousy stinking now!

06:03.955 --> 06:08.273
Now, calm down. This country
takes care of its middle class.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.560
Now, don't be sore at the banks.

06:14.622 --> 06:16.090
Hell, we fired our CEO,

06:16.095 --> 06:18.286
and he barely got out with fifty million dollars.

06:18.975 --> 06:20.822
That poor man! Is he okay?

06:21.168 --> 06:23.947
As okay as you can be
in the north of France.

06:24.110 --> 06:29.000
Now, here's a free tip from me:
Learn to make soup from rocks and grass.

06:29.163 --> 06:31.340
And what would I cook that soup on?

06:31.350 --> 06:34.440
Come on, Marge.
You got the sun, you got hobo fire.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.150
I can't do all the work for you.

06:51.252 --> 06:54.101
I work so hard to make
this house into a home.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.780
And now somebody else
is just gonna take it.

06:57.004 --> 06:58.523
Marge, I'm so sorry.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.750
Why are you here?
You already own a home.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.940
Hey, our old pair
has to live somewhere.

07:02.945 --> 07:06.575
This crap shack makes your
guest room look like winter palace.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.420
I know, I know. But Bernice wants you out.

07:09.447 --> 07:12.540
Don't worry, honey.
We'll come out ahead.

07:12.568 --> 07:15.440
I ripped all the copper wire
out of the walls.

07:17.874 --> 07:19.973
Did you remember to
disconnect it first?

07:20.147 --> 07:20.800
Did I what now?

07:28.738 --> 07:31.150
I know I shouldn't get
too attached to a building,

07:31.160 --> 07:34.165
but that's where Lisa
took her first step.

07:35.645 --> 07:36.803
The kid's height.

07:36.985 --> 07:38.449
Homer's weight.

07:43.344 --> 07:46.930
This is so hard because I always
thought Mom was the strong one.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.400
She is. Look.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.200
Goodbye.

08:01.313 --> 08:04.250
For sale, 742 Evergreen Terrace.

08:04.260 --> 08:06.280
Detached single family dwelling.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.110
Now, who'll stop me off?

08:08.120 --> 08:10.330
Anybody ever get murdered in this house?

08:10.335 --> 08:10.800
No.

08:10.896 --> 08:11.940
Thank you for your time.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.220
One hundred thousand dollars.

08:14.402 --> 08:16.440
Sir, what exactly do you
plan to do with this place?

08:16.450 --> 08:18.485
I need a place to store my cufflinks.

08:18.969 --> 08:21.600
Let's go, kids. I can't watch anymore.

08:21.837 --> 08:24.300
I have one hundred thousand. Going once.

08:28.028 --> 08:29.012
Going twice.

08:31.173 --> 08:32.875
One hundred and one thousand.

08:35.736 --> 08:39.130
Pass. I've already lifted this thing
up once today. I'm not Hercules.

08:39.135 --> 08:39.980
Sold.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.480
Okay, folks. Hand in your paddles.

08:43.051 --> 08:44.370
Round ends together, please.

08:44.918 --> 08:45.580
Round end--

08:46.095 --> 08:48.570
What is this,
Randomly Tossing Your Paddle Day?

08:48.736 --> 08:51.210
Ned, you bought our house.

08:51.421 --> 08:52.290
Why?

08:52.298 --> 08:53.735
So I can rent it back to you.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.890
Just pay what you can 'til
you get back on your feet.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.457
Ned Flanders,

08:57.597 --> 09:00.920
I can't believe
what you doodly did for us.

09:01.112 --> 09:05.070
Well, seriously. Ocean said to
the dirt, "I appreciate the sediment."

09:06.522 --> 09:08.670
And on the zillionth day,

09:08.679 --> 09:10.500
God created hugs.

09:10.503 --> 09:13.370
And it was good!

09:14.735 --> 09:18.180
Come on, kids. Let's take
our stuff back inside.

09:18.185 --> 09:21.210
Better let me go first.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.956
I left a little...

09:23.148 --> 09:26.321
surprise upstairs for the new owner.

09:39.390 --> 09:44.294
<i>For he's a fabulous Flanders</i>

09:44.400 --> 09:47.984
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

09:48.237 --> 09:51.200
<i>He saved our ass!</i>

09:51.861 --> 09:53.400
Okay, everyone. Squeeze in.

09:59.039 --> 10:00.491
Evil triumphs again.

10:08.124 --> 10:10.415
Oh, Homie. That faucet won't stop leaking.

10:10.708 --> 10:14.800
No problem. Just let
Sir Fix-A-Lot slay this chore.

10:24.816 --> 10:25.971
Next problem.

10:26.086 --> 10:28.830
Say, Homer. Why don't you
let me take a peek at that leak.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.907
Ned, please. You're our guest.

10:31.114 --> 10:35.150
Well, actually, as your landlord,
repairs are my responsibility.

10:35.483 --> 10:36.546
I'll just get my tools.

10:42.435 --> 10:43.300
Try her now, Marge.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.664
Hot comes out of hot!

10:46.800 --> 10:48.398
It's like I'm dreaming!

10:48.628 --> 10:49.845
Thank you, Ned.

10:49.853 --> 10:51.180
Well, I guess I'd better be--

10:51.183 --> 10:55.523
Do you have time to look at a few other leaks,
faulty wires, and dangerous mold conditions?

10:55.749 --> 10:58.500
Well, as you are my tenant,
I'll see what I can do.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.348
Well, let's see what else is in the job jar.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.690
It's so beautiful!

11:05.696 --> 11:07.890
No two are exactly alike.

11:07.897 --> 11:10.030
Though many of them are very similar.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.140
I'm back, baby!

11:26.031 --> 11:29.700
It's irresistable! You ask him
to do something and he does it.

11:29.707 --> 11:31.000
He's like a genie!

11:31.073 --> 11:33.210
When I was putting
new installation in your attic,

11:33.228 --> 11:35.900
I slipped on this lamp,
and really banged my head.

11:36.158 --> 11:38.045
So, unless you have
anything else for me...

11:38.477 --> 11:42.440
No, no. I'm just happy
I can finally serve this cake.

11:42.445 --> 11:44.900
"Our house is up to code."

11:47.311 --> 11:50.140
- Hello.
- Ned, I think we have a gas leak!

11:53.523 --> 11:56.115
Well, sorry. I just had
my glass of warm milk

11:56.127 --> 11:58.500
which means I am closed for business.

11:58.505 --> 11:59.819
He won't come over.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.880
He what? Flanders, landlords like
you are the scum of the Earth!

12:03.885 --> 12:06.790
You lounge around in your Egg McMansions,

12:06.794 --> 12:09.285
and we never see you
unless the rent check's late.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.400
Your rent check is late.

12:11.491 --> 12:16.000
You-- Some friend you are! The minute you
become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent?

12:16.010 --> 12:18.755
You better just pray I don't
find out where you live!

12:19.271 --> 12:21.191
Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.660
People like Flanders make me sick.

12:25.800 --> 12:30.190
If I was Marge's landlord, I'd fix up pipes,
and I'd shower with flowers,

12:30.195 --> 12:33.465
and take her on a romantic
getaway to the south seas,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.640
and I'd never return.

12:35.824 --> 12:37.850
Yeah. You'd treat her right.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.245
Well, here's how you get back at Flanders.

12:40.191 --> 12:44.530
You go to the media, and you get them
to expose what a horrible person he really is.

12:44.783 --> 12:47.175
Oh, right. Like <i>Dateline</i> did to you.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.316
Yeah, three times.

12:48.499 --> 12:51.437
The last one was nominated for
a Peabody, whatever that is.

12:51.613 --> 12:54.220
This is Kent Brockman with
a Channel Six exclusive:

12:54.224 --> 12:55.880
The Evil Ned.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.170
742 Evergreen Terrace,

12:58.346 --> 13:00.600
the tiny slice of suburban heaven.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.180
But, like dating an actress,

13:02.185 --> 13:05.630
what seemed like heaven
soon turned to hell.

13:06.154 --> 13:09.850
We live in a house
that is trying to kill us.

13:10.542 --> 13:11.177
Hey, Dad.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.142
Who is this Dad
you speak of, Lisa Simpson?

13:16.150 --> 13:17.208
You want a cookie, Dad?

13:17.210 --> 13:17.650
Yes.

13:19.003 --> 13:20.130
Squeaky stair here,

13:20.137 --> 13:21.511
scary portrait there.

13:21.812 --> 13:23.540
Poltergeist in the closet.

13:26.154 --> 13:28.317
I died when Homer sat on me.

13:28.511 --> 13:29.328
Why you little--

13:30.428 --> 13:32.090
I'm the victim here.

13:33.974 --> 13:36.290
So, who is responsible for these outrages?

13:36.298 --> 13:39.320
The man whose side of the story
we didn't even bother to get.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.485
Ned Flanders,

13:40.650 --> 13:43.600
the worst person who ever lived.

13:50.385 --> 13:52.063
Let's see what else is on.

13:56.093 --> 13:57.120
Oh, this is good.

14:02.108 --> 14:06.110
Homer Simpson, I took pity on you,
and what do I get in return?

14:06.119 --> 14:07.451
A kick in the kadiddlehopper!

14:08.388 --> 14:09.200
Kadiddlehopper.

14:09.283 --> 14:12.000
It's not funny, that's how I swear!

14:12.206 --> 14:14.990
Fine. You're mad.
What are you gonna do about it?

14:14.995 --> 14:17.850
When the month is up, I want you out!

14:18.094 --> 14:21.800
Fine. I'll get another neighbor to
buy the house and let us live in it.

14:21.850 --> 14:25.045
- We won't do it!
- Your leaving is our Christmas!

14:25.209 --> 14:29.820
Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out
on Christmas, would you?

14:39.491 --> 14:41.385
What? Who is that?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.016
It is me, Jesus.

14:44.409 --> 14:46.950
I have come from my workshop
in the North Pole to say,

14:46.955 --> 14:50.374
Don't evict the Simpsons.

14:50.599 --> 14:54.600
Say, Jesus. What was the name
of the son of Zachariah?

14:54.821 --> 14:56.247
It was F--

14:56.724 --> 14:58.790
Do you have a computer nearby?

15:02.595 --> 15:04.550
He's nailing something to our door.

15:05.350 --> 15:07.000
I wonder if it's theses.

15:07.162 --> 15:08.249
Ew, that's gross.

15:08.479 --> 15:10.891
Homie, I think it's an eviction notice.

15:11.463 --> 15:12.670
We're gonna be homeless!

15:12.696 --> 15:15.250
Like Lucille Ball in the <i>Stone Pillow</i>!

15:15.255 --> 15:16.264
Don't worry, Marge.

15:16.621 --> 15:18.431
According to this chapter book,

15:18.436 --> 15:20.203
we have a secret weapon.

15:20.290 --> 15:23.350
Evictee will be granted a stay of eviction

15:23.354 --> 15:27.335
if said household includes
a resident aged 65 or over.

15:27.684 --> 15:30.220
Finally, a practical use for my father.

15:30.739 --> 15:34.510
Whee. I'm gonna live like
a human in a real house!

15:35.607 --> 15:36.454
What's the catch?

15:36.682 --> 15:37.632
I'm using you.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.545
For what?

15:38.550 --> 15:39.530
My own devices.

15:39.535 --> 15:40.310
All right.

15:42.266 --> 15:44.164
Tell the world what you saw here.

15:44.565 --> 15:47.459
I'm gonna miss putting make-up
on him while he sleeps.

15:47.786 --> 15:48.975
I've already moved on.

15:54.459 --> 15:56.819
Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us!

15:56.987 --> 15:59.655
Because a senior's living here now!

16:01.450 --> 16:03.938
You're never too old
to ruin things for the young.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.258
Will you kids knock it off?

16:14.488 --> 16:15.950
I'm trying to watch badminton!

16:17.145 --> 16:19.840
Dad, we've been trapped
in the house for days.

16:19.847 --> 16:21.141
Can't we play outside?

16:21.393 --> 16:24.280
Yeah, without the sun,
my hair's reverting to its natural red!

16:24.469 --> 16:26.270
I don't wanna be called rusty again.

16:26.275 --> 16:27.200
I don't!

16:27.400 --> 16:30.910
You know, it says here that
Grampa has to remain in the house.

16:31.127 --> 16:32.450
But we don't!

16:32.459 --> 16:34.650
How about a family outing?

16:34.810 --> 16:35.795
Family outing?

16:36.000 --> 16:36.750
I'll start.

16:36.761 --> 16:37.761
Lisa's gay!

16:37.800 --> 16:40.300
Right. 'Cos I wouldn't
wanna be gay like my heroes

16:40.324 --> 16:42.660
Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag,

16:42.666 --> 16:46.168
Sappho of Lesbos,
and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty.

16:46.546 --> 16:48.330
Well, I guess we could take a quick walk.

16:48.508 --> 16:53.043
We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD
of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.

16:53.152 --> 16:54.883
<i>Now when I've got a downhill lie,</i>

16:55.054 --> 16:56.554
<i>I'd like to swing wide.</i>

16:56.563 --> 17:00.875
<i>Just like Patton did when he swung past
Kesselring's boys in the Ardennes Forest.</i>

17:01.057 --> 17:02.073
<i>Let's watch.</i>

17:09.392 --> 17:12.520
This is what I call living in the past.

17:17.397 --> 17:20.119
So, after I paid for the ice cream cones,

17:20.140 --> 17:23.051
I said "Thank you",
and went on my way.

17:23.385 --> 17:25.295
We know, Dad. We were there.

17:26.726 --> 17:30.200
I know it seems that way because
I'm such a vivid storyteller.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.840
Now here's another story
called "Bart's Mistake."

17:32.997 --> 17:34.220
We were walking home when--

17:37.264 --> 17:38.507
How could this have happened?

17:38.512 --> 17:40.368
Because your father lives with me now.

17:40.373 --> 17:42.793
Flanders feeds me people food.

17:42.798 --> 17:44.069
Well, I can't compete with that.

17:46.383 --> 17:49.810
Oh, my God. We're out on the street.

17:52.876 --> 17:55.770
Honey, don't cry. It could be worse.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.160
At least it's not raining.

18:00.584 --> 18:01.890
See, I told you. It's not raining.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.103
So, we're just homeless.

18:06.866 --> 18:09.300
Kids, if you get lost,
remember where we are.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.702
75 beds from that wall,

18:11.707 --> 18:13.843
and 100 beds from the crazy guy.

18:14.078 --> 18:18.475
He's probably the best I've ever seen, although
he stole the idea from Amelia Earhart and...

18:19.000 --> 18:22.939
I hate this place. The clothes they give us
are the clothes we gave to charity last year.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.717
There's a lesson here. Life is fickle.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.913
You should appreciate every--

18:27.918 --> 18:29.431
Stop kicking, Bart!

18:29.436 --> 18:31.363
But kicking is the only toy I have.

18:31.531 --> 18:34.310
That's not true.
You have bug bites you can scratch.

18:34.829 --> 18:37.203
This is the lowest we've sunk.

18:37.438 --> 18:40.139
That's the answer! Pawn the king's bishop four!

18:42.846 --> 18:45.500
You two are the kind of tenants
every landlord dreams of.

18:45.509 --> 18:48.085
Excellent credit, Christian, but not Baptist.

18:48.094 --> 18:52.270
And, let's see, according to your application,
you only have sex for procreation.

18:52.277 --> 18:53.060
If that.

18:54.548 --> 18:59.461
Well now I'll just put my John Hancock on the dock,
and you can give me the key to the lock.

18:59.649 --> 19:01.411
My ballpoint's all clicked up for you.

19:01.413 --> 19:05.600
No, thanks. Don't believe in
borrowing things from my neighbor.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.893
Lord, ye said love thy neighbor,
but you didn't have to make it so easy.

19:10.318 --> 19:12.221
Whacha got there, Woofy Goldberg?

19:13.230 --> 19:14.126
Who's this?

19:14.640 --> 19:17.373
That's just a family who used to...

19:18.420 --> 19:19.322
make my life...

19:21.150 --> 19:21.817
interesting.

19:21.881 --> 19:24.100
I'll just add my initials there.

19:24.414 --> 19:29.326
<i>For he's a fabulous Flanders</i>

19:29.331 --> 19:29.919
There.

19:29.926 --> 19:33.730
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

19:33.736 --> 19:34.596
Oh, and there.

19:34.833 --> 19:35.846
Exciting.

19:40.755 --> 19:41.510
Folks...

19:41.513 --> 19:43.180
And leased.

19:43.385 --> 19:44.842
I'm afraid you can't live here.

19:45.022 --> 19:47.010
Roger, dodger.
Back in the car, Nance.

19:47.212 --> 19:48.870
Yay, but why?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.500
Well, the people who lived here before...

19:52.077 --> 19:54.244
weren't always the best neighbors,
but I love them.

19:54.410 --> 19:58.340
You can't be a saint unless
you live among the lepers.

19:58.610 --> 19:59.586
I hope you don't mind.

19:59.701 --> 20:01.565
I'd hope you won't mind when we sue.

20:01.932 --> 20:02.850
I think you should.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.250
The court papers will be
a great way to stay in touch.

20:05.642 --> 20:07.436
Well hasn't this been a peach of a breach?

20:08.966 --> 20:09.850
We'll see you in court.

20:09.910 --> 20:14.340
Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never
abuse our friendship again.

20:14.531 --> 20:16.200
It's okay if you backslide a little.

20:16.222 --> 20:19.450
Never. Hurray for stupid Flanders!

20:19.808 --> 20:21.489
The Simpsons are back.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.100
I really hate this neighborhood.

20:30.305 --> 20:36.506
