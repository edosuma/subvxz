[Myeong-cheol] <i>I started contacting

1:11:11.625 --> 1:11:15.250
But my son soon died.

1:11:15.833 --> 1:11:19.042
Then someone broke into my office.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.792
They took the list from my computer.

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:28.333
It must be someone who needed the list.

1:11:30.167 --> 1:11:32.625
Someone must've needed the blood like me.

1:11:33.292 --> 1:11:37.792
<i>Or maybe even an organ.</i>

1:11:40.417 --> 1:11:41.292
An organ?

Su-jin?

1:12:35.042 --> 1:12:37.458
Yes. May I help you?

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:44.167
[cell phone vibrates]

for three years?</i>

1:12:58.625 --> 1:13:02.458
<i>How did Sang-man Yoo know
he had to run off to Tokyo?</i>

1:13:03.167 --> 1:13:06.500
<i>And why'd he die at the police station?</i>

1:13:08.792 --> 1:13:10.542
What's wrong...

1:13:11.292 --> 1:13:13.708
with Su-jin?

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:49.750
<i>He's the one who arrested Sang-man Yoo

1:13:52.333 --> 1:13:54.583
<i>He graduated
from Korean National Police University.</i>

1:13:54.833 --> 1:13:58.958

How could you?

1:14:36.208 --> 1:14:37.333
Why?

1:14:38.333 --> 1:14:40.208
I'm trying to save my daughter.

1:14:41.375 --> 1:14:47.208

1:15:07.667 --> 1:15:08.667
Relax.

1:15:09.875 --> 1:15:11.833
I don't know where he is either.

1:15:18.750 --> 1:15:23.875
Only Kyung-hwan Choi knows
where Min-woo is.

After that...

1:16:27.333 --> 1:16:29.375
there was nothing I could do.

1:16:30.958 --> 1:16:33.458
I couldn't find a heart for Su-jin.

1:16:35.292 --> 1:16:36.875
I couldn't find your son.

1:16:39.792 --> 1:16:40.875
But...

do you know why I'm telling you this?

1:16:49.208 --> 1:16:50.375
Thanks to you,

I found a way to meet
that fucking bastard.

1:17:03.958 --> 1:17:06.125
You gave me my last hope.

1:17:08.458 --> 1:17:10.333
I'll promise you this.

1:17:11.792 --> 1:17:18.333
When I find Min-woo,
I'll tell him you loved him.

1:17:19.250 --> 1:17:20.250
No!

1:17:21.792 --> 1:17:22.958
Let him be in peace.

1:19:47.833 --> 1:19:49.375
Hold on a bit longer.

After the transplant,

1:19:55.625 --> 1:19:57.500
let's go to an amusement park.

Of course, I'm fine.

1:20:45.625 --> 1:20:47.292
Don't worry.

1:20:47.792 --> 1:20:51.333
But you don't look so good.

1:20:53.917 --> 1:20:55.167
Sir...

My son is alive.

Hey, I told you so.
I told you we'd find your boy.

1:21:07.292 --> 1:21:09.333
Don't worry about me.

1:21:11.167 --> 1:21:12.375
- Boys?
- Yes?

1:21:12.458 --> 1:21:15.667
Give him a phone and car key.

1:21:16.125 --> 1:21:17.208

Where are you? I called many times.

1:21:45.542 --> 1:21:48.625
I found out Min-woo is alive.

1:21:49.375 --> 1:21:50.375
What?

1:21:50.417 --> 1:21:53.208
Chief Song! He's the culprit!

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:55.750
Kyung-hwan knows where Min-woo is.

1:21:56.167 --> 1:21:59.250
Yong-hyun has to get me
back inside his dream!

1:21:59.333 --> 1:22:03.167
Chief Song was just here for his address.

1:22:03.917 --> 1:22:05.542
Don't go! It's dangerous!

1:22:05.625 --> 1:22:08.417
We have to find Min-woo before Chief Song!

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.333
I'll try it.

I know Kyung-hwan's brainwave frequency.

1:22:14.083 --> 1:22:15.958
And Yong-hyun explained it to me
the other day.

1:22:16.042 --> 1:22:19.458

but let's give it a shot.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.000
Who's asking?

1:22:35.667 --> 1:22:37.833
I must get inside Kyung-hwan Choi's dream.

1:22:38.333 --> 1:22:41.250
What? I'm done with that...

1:22:41.333 --> 1:22:42.667

Seeing the boy's eyes...

1:25:20.333 --> 1:25:21.792
I couldn't kill him.

1:25:23.833 --> 1:25:25.292
That boy can't die,

What's happening?

1:28:15.667 --> 1:28:19.583
Kyung-hwan Choi must be critically ill.
His brainwaves aren't stable.

1:28:20.333 --> 1:28:21.333
So is that...

1:28:21.833 --> 1:28:22.958
dangerous?

1:28:23.958 --> 1:28:26.417
Well, if he dies, he couldn't get worse.

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:27.917
Son of a... [gun cocks]

1:28:29.083 --> 1:28:30.583
Don't you dare touch me!

1:28:31.208 --> 1:28:33.917
If I press this button,
he'll be trapped inside forever.

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.750
[machine beeping]

1:28:35.833 --> 1:28:38.333
[loud crash]

1:28:38.833 --> 1:28:40.583
[hysterical moaning]

1:28:43.083 --> 1:28:45.333
Focus, Kyung-hwan! Focus!

1:28:46.708 --> 1:28:47.875
[loud thudding]

1:28:49.333 --> 1:28:50.542
Where is my son?

1:28:51.208 --> 1:28:54.000
Listen to me. We're inside your dream.

1:28:55.375 --> 1:28:57.750
You've been comatose
for two years since the accident.

1:28:57.833 --> 1:29:00.375
So I came into your dream.

1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.542
What about Chief Song?

1:29:03.792 --> 1:29:06.542
Why is there two of him?

1:29:08.042 --> 1:29:09.708
He came into your dream too.

1:29:09.792 --> 1:29:12.042
One already existed in your dream.

1:29:12.125 --> 1:29:15.542
The other came in from reality like me.

1:29:15.958 --> 1:29:17.833
[rumbling]

1:29:17.917 --> 1:29:18.958
[Dae-ho groans]

1:29:24.292 --> 1:29:25.833
We don't have much time.

1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:32.958
If you die, I can't find my son.

1:29:35.333 --> 1:29:38.042
I didn't want him to die.

1:29:40.167 --> 1:29:42.542
I had no idea they'd kill him.

1:29:42.875 --> 1:29:44.250
Honestly.

1:29:44.333 --> 1:29:45.583
I don't resent you.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:49.958
[Dae-ho]
<i>So please tell me. I have to find Min-woo.</i>

1:29:50.333 --> 1:29:53.958
I ran away with him that night.

1:29:55.375 --> 1:29:59.500
I took him to a Catholic church
on an island and said he was an orphan.

1:30:01.292 --> 1:30:03.708
I left him there. [Sniffs]

1:30:04.292 --> 1:30:08.125
Min-woo must think you're dead by now.

1:30:12.417 --> 1:30:13.833
[both grunt]

1:30:21.083 --> 1:30:23.417
[Kyung-hwan groans]

1:30:27.917 --> 1:30:30.875
[groans in pain]

1:30:41.667 --> 1:30:43.250
I'm so sorry.

1:30:44.167 --> 1:30:45.167

1:31:04.500 --> 1:31:05.708
[groans]

1:31:18.542 --> 1:31:20.125
Sorry, pal.

1:31:21.333 --> 1:31:22.458
But...

1:31:23.792 --> 1:31:25.125
I have to save my daughter

1:31:28.083 --> 1:31:29.458
no matter what.

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:38.292
[trilling]

1:31:46.667 --> 1:31:48.125

1:31:53.333 --> 1:31:55.333
[dramatic music]

1:32:02.625 --> 1:32:04.458

1:32:14.750 --> 1:32:16.792

1:32:20.833 --> 1:32:22.750

1:32:24.708 --> 1:32:26.750
[suspenseful music]

1:32:36.167 --> 1:32:38.458
[Dae-ho screams]

1:32:53.833 --> 1:32:55.042
Su-jin...

1:32:56.875 --> 1:32:59.042
Daddy's so sorry.

1:33:02.167 --> 1:33:04.250
[rumbles]

1:33:13.333 --> 1:33:14.375
<i>Min-woo.</i>

1:33:15.875 --> 1:33:17.625
<i>I'll never give up on you!</i>

1:33:29.417 --> 1:33:31.097
[Yong-hyun] <i>When you press the chime bell,</i>

1:33:31.917 --> 1:33:33.875
concentrate on moving your brainwaves.

1:34:22.958 --> 1:34:24.208
[nun] Are you Min-woo's father?

1:34:24.542 --> 1:34:25.542
Yes.

1:34:31.667 --> 1:34:33.083
NAMHAE CATHOLIC CHURCH

1:34:52.333 --> 1:34:53.333
Peter?

1:34:54.333 --> 1:34:55.667
Remember your father?

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.333
[nun whispers] It's okay. Go on.

1:35:08.875 --> 1:35:09.958
Go on.

1:35:30.958 --> 1:35:32.375
Hi, Daddy.

1:35:37.208 --> 1:35:40.000
Hello, son.

1:35:47.292 --> 1:35:49.792
[dramatic music]

1:36:10.167 --> 1:36:12.292
I'm so sorry, Min-woo.

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:14.500
Daddy's late.

1:36:19.333 --> 1:36:21.292
