WEBVTT

00:08.800 --> 00:10.768
This is my office?

00:10.810 --> 00:13.278
(laughs):
Yes.

00:13.310 --> 00:16.802
You have a $10,000 stipend
to decorate,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.602
and there is an art loan program

00:18.650 --> 00:20.447
for equity partners.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.380
Here are your keys.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.387
And welcome.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.411
Thank you.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.551
(laughs)

00:31.760 --> 00:34.797
Uh, we'll have this,
uh, cleared out soon,

00:34.830 --> 00:36.366
but, uh...

00:36.400 --> 00:38.527
this should be good
in the meantime.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.663
You are highly
valued here, Cary.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.837
Good to hear.

00:41.870 --> 00:45.260
Please keep this between us,
but there is a good chance

00:45.310 --> 00:47.631
we will lose a partner
in the next six months.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.238
Which partner?

00:49.280 --> 00:51.601
Well, I can't say,
unfortunately, but...

00:51.650 --> 00:54.517
I would like to see you
join our ranks.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.711
Before she became
a partner,

00:56.750 --> 00:59.355
Alicia made herself
valuable by interviewing

00:59.390 --> 01:01.415
and hiring a new associate.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.553
We would like you
to do the same.

01:03.590 --> 01:04.727
These are rsums.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.250
Please look them over

01:06.300 --> 01:08.097
and just keep
us posted.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.332
I need to hire you.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.130
Okay.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.647
What are you working
on at the moment?

01:22.680 --> 01:23.499
Employee background checks.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.314
Pass that off to the
new Investigator.

01:26.350 --> 01:30.810
I need you to do a background
check on a partner.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.283
VVho?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.412
Me.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.451
_Give me a
minute, please.

01:35.490 --> 01:36.684
No calls.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.458
Peter Florrick has offered me

01:41.500 --> 01:44.196
the vacated
Illinois Supreme Court seat

01:44.230 --> 01:45.868
if he wins the
governorshlp.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.595
I know there are
always attempts

01:47.640 --> 01:49.608
to smear a
potential Judge,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.733
so I want to know
where I'm vulnerable.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.374
Congratulations.

01:53.410 --> 01:55.503
Thank you.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.509
Hi. Where are you,
and what are you on?

01:58.550 --> 01:59.471
What am I on?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.748
What case?

02:00.780 --> 02:02.748
Oh, uh, Sweeney. Why?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.611
Okay, I need you take over
my employee background checks.

02:05.650 --> 02:06.617
I'm innocent.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.786
Yes, you've said.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.549
But you don't
believe me.

02:09.590 --> 02:11.785
I think you like that
I don't believe you.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.219
I think you like
that I represent you

02:14.260 --> 02:15.693
even when I know
you're guilty.

02:15.730 --> 02:18.369
I like a lot of things
about you, Mrs. Florrick.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.391
I must have had
issues as a child.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.431
You feed my Mary
Poppins obsession.

02:22.470 --> 02:24.335
Here's the thing,
Mr. Sweeney.

02:24.370 --> 02:27.476
I think you threw a birthday
party that got out of hand

02:27.510 --> 02:29.398
and ended up
costing the Hirschorn Club

02:29.450 --> 02:30.542
$80,000 in damage.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.478
That's all.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.478
I think that the prosecution
is overreacting.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.580
And I hate to disappoint you,
but I think you're innocent.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.941
You're right, it's not as
much fun when you believe me.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.480
Ithoughtso.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.579
Ah, Isobel.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.450
You know Alicia.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.354
ISOBEL:
Yes, I do.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.948
She questioned me
in court a year ago.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.525
Oh, yes-- when we were
all on opposite sides.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.458
My, how the wheel turns.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.368
"Mutability is our tragedy,
but it's also our hope."

02:55.400 --> 02:56.503
Oh, I love it
when he talks like that.

02:56.540 --> 02:57.507
Alicia. Hello.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.939
Laura, hi.
Good to see you.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.837
Uh, first-name basis?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.541
Should I be jealous?

03:03.580 --> 03:06.572
What, that I like her
more than I like you? Sure.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.212
Prosecution has been dragging
its feet on discovery!

03:08.250 --> 03:09.615
...all evidence currently,
the State needs more time,

03:09.650 --> 03:11.208
Your Honor.
It_ has been
SIX months

03:11.250 --> 03:13.457
since Mr. Sweeney has been
accused of disorderly conduct,

03:15.790 --> 03:17.428
No, he fired a gun
at this party!

03:17.460 --> 03:18.654
And given the
fact that it was

03:18.690 --> 03:19.691
a private club that
served alcohol,

03:19.730 --> 03:21.550
that's a Class 4 felony.
POLITI: Okay, I get it.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.568
I get it. We're both angry.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.398
And we like to express
our anger in loud voices.

03:26.440 --> 03:26.997
But, see, here's
the thing:

03:27.040 --> 03:28.439
I'm a judge.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.961
I'm unfazed by loud voices.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.706
So here's the long
and short of it.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.900
You plead this out!

03:34.940 --> 03:36.009
Get it out of my court!

03:36.040 --> 03:39.976
This was a party that got
out of hand, Madam ASA.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.942
No one died,
and as far as I can tell,

03:41.980 --> 03:42.947
no one even got hurt!

03:42.990 --> 03:43.945
No one did.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.685
Oh, Mr. Sweeney,
please know that

03:45.720 --> 03:48.609
you can only hurt your cause
by opening your friggin' mouth.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.958
Okay, you two, come
on, get up here.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.890
Court-mandated bargaining.
Come on.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.522
We want to plead this out,
Your Honor,

03:54.560 --> 03:55.720
but Ms. Hellinger...
Shut up.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.728
Nobody talks until I ask.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.590
Now, what will you take,
Counselor?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.959
Exoneration-- _
my client didn't do It.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.934
Your client is a psychopath
who's lucky

04:02.970 --> 04:04.938
he didn't get convicted
for killing his wife.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.699
And what will you take?

04:06.740 --> 04:08.970
Six years, the maximum.
One year, two
years probation.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.307
No, Your Honor.
Two years probation.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.578
Good. Compromise.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.612
See? There we go.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.948
No. Six years, the maximum.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.811
We're not bending.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.818
DIANE: It's been six months,
and they're still

04:19.860 --> 04:20.815
not bargaining?

04:20.860 --> 04:21.918
They still insist
it's a Class 4.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.325
It's about
the election.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.850
State's Attorney
doesn't want to bargain

04:24.890 --> 04:25.925
with Mr. Sweeney
and look weak on crime.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.927
SWEENEY:
Really?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.053
Your husband doesn't like me?

04:29.100 --> 04:30.021
WILL:
Wait out the prosecution.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.662
In one month,
the gubernatorial race will

04:31.700 --> 04:33.497
be over, and I bet
they let Mr. Sweeney go

04:33.540 --> 04:34.495
with two months' probation.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.962
SWEENEY:
Good. We delay.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.729
That's always best.
DIANE:
Well, then let's turn

04:37.770 --> 04:38.964
to your business holdings,
Mr. Sweeney.

04:39.010 --> 04:41.399
DIANE:
Alicia, Cary, thank you.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.718
(door closes)

04:50.750 --> 04:51.717
Oh.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.956
Ms. Swift, hello.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.719
I'm supposed to be
in the ladies' room.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.058
Just down the hall.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.999
Colin fires lavwers
once a week.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.918
But he's kept you on.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.926
You're probably the most
successful relationship

05:04.970 --> 05:06.790
in his life.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.899
I wouldn't call it
a relationship.
He talks about you.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.033
Don't you want to know
how he talks about you?

05:11.070 --> 05:12.833
No, actually, I don't.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.632
Not sexually. Well...

05:14.680 --> 05:15.931
(chuckles): not all
the time sexually.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.073
_ You are_
pristine to him.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.078
He asked me if I
found you desirable,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.509
but I find
everyone desirable.

05:22.550 --> 05:24.347
He asked me
to marry him.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.846
I'm not sure I will.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.357
Oh, I like him enough.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.459
He's rich.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.527
But the question is,

05:31.560 --> 05:34.927
ifI marry him,
will he kill me?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.832
As his lawyer,
I can't speak to the rumors

05:40.870 --> 05:42.531
that he killed his first wife.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.835
But I do know the supposed
reason for the killing

05:45.870 --> 05:47.974
was his wife's money.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.945
And... you have no money,
to speak of.

05:50.980 --> 05:54.074
So... there would be
no reason to kill you.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.914
Your hair would look
prettier shorter.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.582
Your first interview is here.
You want a rundown?

06:05.630 --> 06:06.995
Yeah.

06:08.030 --> 06:11.659
Have a seat on
my lovely couch.

06:11.700 --> 06:15.067
Gregory Steck-- he graduated
from Harvard Law School in 2006.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.909
You can just say Harvard.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.158
Graduated from Harvard in 2006.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.098
Currently clerks
for Judge Wallace.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.801
Illinois Supreme Court
Justice Wallace?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.147
Yes, Illinois
Supreme Court justice.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.148
Uh, his Facebook page
was scrubbed clean.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.147
Nothing too dramatic.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.444
Okay. And here he is.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.515
ROBYN:
He's expecting $150,000 a year.

06:31.550 --> 06:32.756
Other firms are pursuing.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.758
No, no, no. Stay.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.428
M-Me stay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.757
Look better with two.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.018
Should I say something?

06:40.060 --> 06:41.425
No. Don't smile.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.428
Look severe.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.092
Cary, good to meet you.
Thanks for your interest.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.802
And this is Robyn Burdine,
one of our top lawyers.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.076
I built my own canoe.

06:54.110 --> 06:55.202
You built your own canoe?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.332
Is that a metaphor?
No, no.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.871
When I was home over Christmas,
I actually built one.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.617
And I realized I like
to get my fingernails dirty.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.049
You know, like last night,

07:03.090 --> 07:06.082
I was writing Wallace's
majority opinion on Miles,

07:06.120 --> 07:08.179
and I thought,
what am I doing?

07:08.220 --> 07:11.087
You know, if I die today,
no one will know I did anything.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.519
You clerk for a Supreme Court
justice long enough,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.619
you want to see
the law in action.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.558
Well, Robyn can tell you--

07:16.600 --> 07:17.760
most associates never see

07:17.800 --> 07:19.859
the inside of a courtroom
for a few years.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.060
Oh, well, that won't bother me.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.830
I've been Wallace's go-to
on draft opinions long enough.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.098
I've done his last four.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.200
I need new fields,
new streams.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.049
Do I know you from Harvard
or someplace?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.206
CARY:
No.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.615
Robyn's from Georgetown.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.618
Oh, Georgetown. Really?
How'd you like it?

07:34.650 --> 07:36.811
Humid.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.215
(laughs)

07:41.220 --> 07:43.029
CARY:
So, what'd you think?

07:43.060 --> 07:45.483
He is a braggart.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.054
Is that a bad thing?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.625
I don't know, do you
want a braggart?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.729
If he's got something
to brag about, sure.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.738
Well, people who have
something to brag about

07:53.770 --> 07:55.658
usually don't brag.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.221
Hello.
(grunts)

08:17.260 --> 08:19.148
I'm awake.
The interview
today with Steck--

08:19.190 --> 08:22.250
what did he say about
an opinion he was working on?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.722
"I was writing Wallace's
majority opinion on Miles..."

08:23.770 --> 08:25.067
He said "Miles,"
didn't he?

08:25.100 --> 08:26.829
Yeah. Why?

08:26.870 --> 08:29.191
I think I know why
they won't plead on Sweeney.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.606
And it has nothing to do
with the election.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.073
(doorbell rings)

08:33.110 --> 08:35.078
Hey.
Hello.

08:35.110 --> 08:38.273
Sorry. I'm Cary Agos from
your mom's work, and I just...

08:38.310 --> 08:40.210
(shower running)
Cary Argus is here.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.219
He's from your work.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.808
ALICIA:
VVho?

08:44.850 --> 08:46.249
The People v.
Miles decision

08:46.290 --> 08:47.814
will affect _
Sweeney's sentencmg.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.213
That's why the State's
Attorney's office

08:49.260 --> 08:51.728
won't bargain-- it's
a delaying tactic.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.125
How do you know?
An interview today.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.220
Someone who clerks for Wallace,
the conservative justice;

08:56.260 --> 08:58.763
he finished writing
the majority opinion.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.998
That would make the gun-firing
his third strike.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.337
Yeah. Sweeney's already
been convicted

09:04.370 --> 09:06.065
of_two other
major felonies.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.202
Double enhancement means

09:07.240 --> 09:09.708
not only would Sweeney's
firing of the gun

09:09.750 --> 09:12.947
be bumped up to a felony, but it
would count as his third strike.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.868
He would get life in prison.
That's right.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.717
No judicial discretion--
Sweeney loses the case,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.183
he goes to
prison for life.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.916
Oh, my God. From a possible
misdemeanor to life in prison.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.086
Another thing.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.156
You were at Sweeney's
arraignment, weren't you?
Yes.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.124
And you automatically asked
for a speedy trial, right?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.127
Yes, by rote.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.628
Uh... are we past 160 days?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.728
No.

09:30.770 --> 09:31.964
Tomorrow.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.228
We're not ready to go to trial.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.339
I know.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.338
But the prosecution
isn't either.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.201
They were thinking
of slow-playing this

09:38.240 --> 09:40.208
until the Supreme Court
opinion came down.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.969
So we would have to rush this.
Yeah.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.808
You have to conduct a defense
and get it to deliberations

09:44.850 --> 09:46.272
before the Supreme Court
opinion comes down.

09:46.310 --> 09:48.016
Or Sweeney faces life in prison.

09:48.050 --> 09:50.314
That's right.

09:50.350 --> 09:52.989
We have to run
the fastest trial in history.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.291
Excuse me?

10:05.330 --> 10:06.763
We want to exercise

10:06.800 --> 10:09.268
Mr. Sweeney's right
to a speedy trial.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.359
Your Honor, I...
We're not ready.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.331
You want a speedy trial now?

10:12.370 --> 10:15.203
Well, we wanted
a speedy trial 159 days ago

10:15.240 --> 10:17.276
at Mr. Sweeney's arraignment
when we requested it,

10:17.310 --> 10:18.846
as you can see here

10:18.880 --> 10:20.040
from the arraignment
transcript.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.377
Your Honor, this is...

10:21.420 --> 10:23.411
Every defense attorney
insists on that by rote.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.008
Yes, but we meant it.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.017
And we still do.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.312
Are you ready to go to trial,
Mrs. Florrick?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.112
We are, Your Honor.
ASA Hellinger?

10:29.160 --> 10:30.320
We're absolutely not.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.725
ALICIA: That really
doesn't matter,

10:31.760 --> 10:33.899
Your Honor, given that
the speedy trial statute

10:33.930 --> 10:36.421
imposes a 160-day time limit.

10:36.460 --> 10:40.089
The prosecution must go to trial
today or release our client.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.361
(indistinct chatter)

10:47.210 --> 10:48.302
Quiet down.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.046
We have
an unusual Situation here.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.298
We have court
in two and a half hours,

10:52.350 --> 10:54.443
and we were preparing
for court in four months.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.277
So we'll need all hands on deck.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.345
Do we have a ballistics expert?
Not yet. We were planning

10:58.390 --> 10:59.755
to find out
who the prosecution hired.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.257
Who do we know is free?
Who's the best?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.281
Well, Kurt McVeigh is the best.

11:05.390 --> 11:06.789
I think he's working on a case.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.957
Maybe someone could call him
and see

11:09.000 --> 11:10.922
if he'd make himself available.
SWEENEY: Ah.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.234
Am I missing something here?

11:13.270 --> 11:15.135
No. I'll try him.

11:15.170 --> 11:15.932
Good. Cary, Robyn,

11:15.970 --> 11:17.403
see if you can get
more information

11:17.440 --> 11:18.702
on when the opinion
will be published.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.037
We'll try.
SWEENEY: And I want

11:20.080 --> 11:21.069
one of the partners on this.

11:21.110 --> 11:22.099
Alicia is a partner.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.368
No, one of the name partners.

11:23.410 --> 11:24.946
My apologies, Mrs. Florrick,

11:24.980 --> 11:27.141
but I want the
biggest guns.
DIANE: Ah, good.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.215
Will is free.

11:30.050 --> 11:32.416
You take the Sweeney case.
I can't.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.781
Why not?

11:33.820 --> 11:35.082
You're the litigator.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.226
I'm... involved.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.989
With whom? Judge Politi?

11:40.030 --> 11:43.363
The ASA, Laura Hellinger.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.924
You're kidding?
You're dating her?

11:44.970 --> 11:47.097
I... For a week.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.266
KA|__IN DA:
Diane?

11:48.300 --> 11:49.460
Uh, I have something for you.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.307
DIANE:
Oh, uh, one second.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.877
Just get a sign-off
from Sweeney,

11:52.910 --> 11:54.798
and we're protected
on malpractice.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.808
Maybe it's good.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.926
(knocking)

12:12.960 --> 12:15.428
Hi. Mr. Sweeney, could I speak
to you for a minute?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.324
Out here.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.361
Certainly.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.500
(door closes)

12:26.540 --> 12:28.531
Are we confessing?

12:28.580 --> 12:32.346
(chuckles):
No, no.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.349
You've asked for a partner
to second chair your case.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.042
I feel obligated
to warn you that

12:38.090 --> 12:42.015
I'm in a relationship with
the prosecutor in your case.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.028
Ah.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.255
A sexual relationship?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.928
I'd rather not go into detail.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.926
Yes, I know. You'd rather not.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.494
But I'm your client,

12:53.540 --> 12:56.361
and I bring 22 million a year
into your firm.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.005
And before I sign off,
I want to know.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.474
Is it a sexual relationship?

13:04.210 --> 13:06.178
Not currently.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.178
But you intend it to be?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.984
Mr. Sweeney, it is
your prerogative

13:11.020 --> 13:12.988
to insist
on another lawyer. I...

13:13.020 --> 13:14.419
That's why I love this place.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.052
Everybody sleeps
with everybody else.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.318
Come on.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.827
Yes, I sign off.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.556
As long as I get details.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.174
All right,
so we invite him back.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.370
For a callback interview?

13:34.410 --> 13:37.504
Yeah, and to fish around for
the release date of the opinion.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.505
He's a braggart.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.541
Maybe he'll brag about
when it's being published.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.009
Um, so, you...
you found something?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.357
Yeah.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.518
Look, I'll only tell you
as much as you want to know,

13:52.560 --> 13:55.927
so, at any moment,
you can say, "Stop."

13:58.670 --> 14:01.491
_ "Elena knew
it was wrong to want Damon.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.100
"She was about
to marry Stefan, after all.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.937
"Yet when Damon
drew her close,

14:05.970 --> 14:07.608
"Elena found herself

14:07.640 --> 14:10.473
_"unable_ to resist
his vampire charms.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.501
"When Damon's fangs
dug into her neck,

14:12.550 --> 14:14.279
"her whole body pulsed
with desire.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.617
"She needed him.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.880
She needed him bad."

14:20.120 --> 14:22.054
I... Huh?

14:22.090 --> 14:23.079
It's fan fiction

14:23.130 --> 14:25.348
for the TV show Vampire Diaries.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.956
So? I...

14:29.000 --> 14:30.968
You wrote it.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.434
You... I wrote what? That?

14:33.470 --> 14:35.438
Yeah.

14:35.470 --> 14:39.065
Kalinda, I've never even heard
of the TV show Vampire Diaries.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.476
And if I had,
I wouldn't feel compelled

14:41.510 --> 14:43.171
to write something like...

14:43.210 --> 14:45.178
Does it go on like that?
It does.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.576
Elena and Damon have sex
in the end in a pickup truck.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.939
I'm happy for them.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.447
It came
from your IP address,

14:50.490 --> 14:51.684
and your e-mail account.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.689
Kalinda, I...
I don't know what to say.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.551
Who else has access
to your computer?

14:56.590 --> 14:57.921
No one. No...

14:59.060 --> 15:00.618
Oh.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.127
VVho?
Um...

15:02.160 --> 15:03.195
my housekeeper.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.027
Okay. What's her name?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.059
I'll talk to her.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.362
Diane, I don't think
you understand.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.436
You have to fire her,
and I do need her name.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.232
No.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.238
She is a nice lady
with three kids.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.476
I mean, she just, obviously,

15:13.510 --> 15:14.602
doesn't have any sense
of boundaries.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.107
No. You need to create

15:16.140 --> 15:18.608
a paper trail
to separate yourself from her.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.208
You're wanting to become

15:20.250 --> 15:22.218
an Illinois Supreme Court
justice, Diane.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.617
If your name becomes associated
with vampire fan fiction,

15:25.650 --> 15:27.959
the ridicule factor's
going to be hard to beat.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.981
You need to fire her.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.490
(dance music playing)

15:33.530 --> 15:35.919
(men whooping,
shouting indistinctly)

15:40.040 --> 15:41.667
(gunshot)

15:41.700 --> 15:42.689
(woman screams)

15:42.740 --> 15:46.107
(screaming, clamoring)

15:46.140 --> 15:47.732
HELLINGER:
You shot that, Mr. Catalini?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.304
Uh, it's Catalani.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.170
Yeah, the video?

15:50.210 --> 15:52.644
Yeah, I shot that
on my cell phone.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.409
I thought the party was getting
out of hand.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.543
And you... I...

15:56.580 --> 15:59.219
Just to be clear,
you're wearing those gym clothes

15:59.250 --> 16:01.309
because you came
straight from the gym?

16:01.360 --> 16:05.080
Yeah, I got your call, and,
um, I was on the treadmill.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.586
I was watching the news,
uh, you know,

16:06.630 --> 16:09.394
up there above the treadmill,
and, um, and I got your call...

16:09.430 --> 16:10.658
Okay, I think
we've established the reason

16:10.700 --> 16:12.019
for the witness's clothes.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.196
Can we move on?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.366
Yes. Okay, so...

16:14.400 --> 16:17.563
Str... uh...
strike that, and, uh...

16:18.610 --> 16:20.578
Sorry, Your Honor.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.737
I usually have more time
to prepare.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.338
I sympathize.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.348
We're all actors
Without a script.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.769
So, Mr. Catalini--
Catalani,

16:28.820 --> 16:32.745
uh, you saw Mr. Sweeney,
the defendant over there,

16:32.790 --> 16:34.712
with a gun--

16:34.760 --> 16:37.388
this gun... right?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.352
Yeah, that's it.
It's supposed

16:39.390 --> 16:42.791
to be Capone's gun, and Sweeney
wanted to play William Tell.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.422
He was talking about
how some author

16:44.470 --> 16:46.097
did the same thing
with his wife.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.030
William Burroughs.
Shut up.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.196
Ah, thank you,
Mr. Sweeney.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.537
Mr. Sweeney

16:50.570 --> 16:51.537
wanted to use this gun

16:54.110 --> 16:56.203
Someone's head, yeah.
Nothing further.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.299
Do you hold a grudge,
Mr. Catalani?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.442
No.
Did Mr. Sweeney

16:59.480 --> 17:01.141
fire you?
No. Um,

17:01.180 --> 17:03.341
there was a general downsizing,
but, no, I wasn't fired.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.516
Was the...

17:04.550 --> 17:06.188
the downsizing
at the behest of Mr. Sweeney?

17:06.220 --> 17:07.812
Yeah, I guess.
Nothing further, Your Honor.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.519
We're ready
for the next witness.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.879
Oh, unfortunately, we're not.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.286
Our ballistics expert is stuck
in Salt Lake City...
Your Honor,

17:14.260 --> 17:16.728
POLITI:
Yes, well, you can present
him as a rebuttal witness

17:16.760 --> 17:18.318
when he arrives,
Ms. Hellinger.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.190
Please proceed.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.333
McVEIGH: As you can see,
the bullet entered the body,

17:22.370 --> 17:23.462
and left what we call

17:23.510 --> 17:24.807
a tail splash.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.569
Now, this is basically
the hurling

17:26.610 --> 17:28.339
of injured
tissue behind.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.699
The bullet

17:29.740 --> 17:32.800
moves through the body
and creates a...

17:35.550 --> 17:37.586
The bullet...

17:37.620 --> 17:39.747
the bullet moving
through the body...

17:39.790 --> 17:42.679
You can see here
the bullet as it...

17:42.720 --> 17:44.153
As... I'm sorry.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.078
Uh, what was the question again?

17:46.130 --> 17:48.121
(door opens)

17:55.770 --> 17:57.601
Thank you.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.868
You were wonderful.
I was not wonderful.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.673
I was... distracted.

18:00.710 --> 18:01.802
You were wonderfully distracted.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.740
Sorry about Mr. Romney.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.645
I almost called you
on election night.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.170
To gloat?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.448
No, to sympathize.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.742
I know how it feels.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.111
Kerry in 2004.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.344
Are we really

18:12.390 --> 18:13.812
comparing Kerry to Romney?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.384
(laughs)

18:15.420 --> 18:16.785
I need your help.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.788
With?
A case.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.798
An innocent man.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.492
VVho?

18:23.530 --> 18:25.794
Just give this a chance.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.661
Colin Sweeney.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.668
(laughs)

18:30.710 --> 18:31.665
Kurt, just
look at this.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.771
Even guilty people
can be innocent sometimes.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.301
Just do it for me, please?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.888
Alicia.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.889
Laura, I'm sorry
about how crazy the trial got.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.286
We just had...
Can I ask you...

18:49.320 --> 18:52.357
do you have a
relationship with Will?

18:52.390 --> 18:54.529
What?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.323
Are you two
romantically involved?

18:59.430 --> 19:00.897
No.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.760
We're not involved.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.903
We were,

19:03.940 --> 19:06.431
once, but it was
a long time ago.

19:06.470 --> 19:07.437
It's not still going on?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.902
No, it's over, I swear.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.942
Laura, you're my friend.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.472
So is Will, and I think
it's great that you two are...

19:14.520 --> 19:15.817
whatever you are.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.442
(chuckles)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.811
Okay.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.215
We're late.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.958
WILL:_
So, your testimony,

19:24.990 --> 19:26.821
Ms. Swift, is
that Mr. Sweeney

19:26.860 --> 19:27.690
could not have been
firing this gun,

19:27.730 --> 19:29.288
because at that point,
he was with you?

19:29.330 --> 19:31.264
Yes, in the Rose Salon.
And that's here?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.860
Uh, sorry, Your Honor. We didn't
have time to put it on a slide.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.333
That's all right.
Just plop it

19:35.370 --> 19:36.894
up here on the bench.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.829
Yeah, that's the Rose Salon
right there off the main lounge.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.202
Mm-hmm, and what
were you doing there?

19:42.240 --> 19:43.241
Anal.

19:46.950 --> 19:48.815
(clears throat)
Well, I think that's clear.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.818
No further questions.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.586
(mouthing)

19:54.620 --> 19:55.951
HELLINGER:
So you were having...

19:55.990 --> 19:58.584
you... anal intercourse

19:58.630 --> 20:00.951
with Mr. Sweeney
at the time of the gunshot?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.399
Yes, that is correct, ma'am.

20:02.430 --> 20:03.988
And you're Mr. Sweeney's
live-in girlfriend,

20:04.030 --> 20:05.497
is that right, Ms. Swift?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.293
Yes, I am.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.366
So, why shouldn't this court
dismiss your testimony

20:10.410 --> 20:11.809
as biased?
Because I'm not.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.000
But don't you intend
to marry him?

20:13.040 --> 20:13.972
I'm not so sure about that.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.637
I have my concerns.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.931
Oh, really?

20:16.980 --> 20:18.447
What might those be?

20:18.480 --> 20:19.708
Well, he killed his first wife.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.708
Ms. Hellinger,
any more questions?

20:25.750 --> 20:27.752
I guess not.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.298
(quietly): I think your
girlfriend's gonna need

20:35.330 --> 20:36.627
some makeup sex, hmm?

20:36.660 --> 20:38.719
GREG:
I won't say

20:38.770 --> 20:40.863
I was surprised to get the call,
it's just...

20:40.900 --> 20:42.891
Well, it's good
to be asked back.

20:42.940 --> 20:43.759
Oh, I felt like we just

20:43.810 --> 20:44.731
scratched the surface
of Greg Steck.

20:44.770 --> 20:48.001
Ro... Robyn and I--
we-we looked at each other

20:48.040 --> 20:50.349
after our interview,
and... and we realized

20:50.380 --> 20:51.699
we hadn't asked you anything

20:51.750 --> 20:53.547
about your duties
at the Supreme Court.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.571
Oh, well,
you have another three hours?

20:55.620 --> 20:56.575
We might.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.247
(laughs)

20:59.920 --> 21:01.478
So you've been writing up

21:01.520 --> 21:02.782
all of Wallace's opinions?

21:02.820 --> 21:04.720
Oh, pretty much.
I mean, you know how it is.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.785
Judges do none of the work,
get all the glory.

21:06.830 --> 21:07.899
And the, uh...

21:07.930 --> 21:09.056
the-the. ..

21:09.100 --> 21:10.419
the Miles opinion--

21:10.470 --> 21:12.597
did the justice
give you notes on that?

21:12.630 --> 21:13.858
No, no.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.368
He's been taking it
out on his, uh...

21:17.940 --> 21:19.931
I'm sorry.

21:19.970 --> 21:22.837
This might be my mom;
she's in the hospital.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.939
Sorry, Cary,

21:24.980 --> 21:27.039
Robyn.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.048
That was Hockney & Barnes.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.616
They just hired me.

21:30.650 --> 21:31.639
Wait. What?

21:31.690 --> 21:34.056
Yeah, I told them to get
back to me by 3:00 pm.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.615
That was them.
Thanks for your interest.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.355
Wait. We may want
to hire you.

21:39.890 --> 21:41.892
Okay.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.061
Uh, I'll check
with my friends in Springfield,

21:46.100 --> 21:48.034
see if they know anything
about Miles.

21:48.070 --> 21:48.991
No, I'll go after him.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.507
It won't make a _difference.
He got a job.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.804
I won't go after him
about a job.

21:55.110 --> 21:58.341
_ KALINDA: _
Okay, this is the prosecution's
ballistics re-creation.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.541
That's the spot where
they recovered the bullet.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.617
And here,
their experts say that

22:03.650 --> 22:05.584
they can prove that
the bullet was ﬁred

22:05.620 --> 22:07.759
from the doorway
to this room.
The Rose Salon.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.429
That's where we proved Sweeney
was having sex. Damn it.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.883
So, we rebut the expert.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.591
That's our only option.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.393
DIANE:
Kurt?

22:16.430 --> 22:17.419
Yeah?

22:17.470 --> 22:20.860
We only have a few hours
to rebut their testimony.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.806
Kurt, where
are you going?

22:25.840 --> 22:26.909
Out.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.009
Where?

22:28.040 --> 22:31.373
To rebut their testimony.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.509
There was some debate
whether to spackle it over,

22:37.550 --> 22:39.438
or wear it
as a badge of honor.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.117
As you might expect,
inertia took over.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.354
Thank you, Mr. Creed.

22:44.890 --> 22:48.053
Do you want me to hold
that light for you?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.865
It'll take
as long as it takes.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.502
No, I didn't
say anything.

23:02.910 --> 23:05.470
So... Obamacare.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.940
I'm just joking.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.743
Sorry, something
about you

23:09.780 --> 23:11.441
makes me want
to tease you.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.980
What is that?

23:13.020 --> 23:15.056
KURT:
A laser.

23:17.090 --> 23:20.025
So, are you still
with your protg?

23:21.500 --> 23:22.489
My...

23:22.530 --> 23:25.567
Protg. Miranda.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.693
Last time I saw you,
she was spreading

23:27.740 --> 23:31.039
her Fox News pixie dust
all over you.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.038
She's heading up the
San Diego crime lab.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.935
Oh, how nice for her.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.847
Very warm there.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.848
Like Baywatch PD.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.575
Am I bothering you?

23:41.620 --> 23:43.918
No. No, this is
entertaining. Please.

23:47.150 --> 23:48.856
KURT:
What room is that?

23:48.890 --> 23:50.551
DIANE:
The Rose Salon.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.098
Isn't that bad?

23:54.130 --> 23:55.859
Yes.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.029
Is it still bad?

24:03.240 --> 24:05.606
Yes.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.198
DIANE:
Well, you'll tell me

24:07.240 --> 24:09.936
when it becomes good?

24:11.180 --> 24:12.943
(clears throat)

24:12.980 --> 24:14.868
You heading back to
the country tonight?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.444
No.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.987
You at the Edgewater?

24:19.020 --> 24:20.214
Yeah, why?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.911
No _reason.
Dinner?

24:22.960 --> 24:24.450
Yes. Good.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.220
Um...

24:26.260 --> 24:28.649
what is this?

24:30.700 --> 24:31.962
Where the bullet came from.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.028
It's called the rainbow effect.

24:35.070 --> 24:36.731
To determine where
a shooter stood,

24:36.770 --> 24:37.930
you need to calculate

24:37.970 --> 24:38.937
the bullet's trajectory.

24:38.970 --> 24:42.576
And the arch of a bullet
can look like a rainbow.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.841
And do bullets create
different types of... rainbows?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.610
Yes, guns do-- in this case,
you have a 1929 pistol

24:48.650 --> 24:52.586
firing a .38-caliber lead bullet
made circa 1930.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.053
ALICIA: And is the
fact that it was

24:54.090 --> 24:55.284
made in 1930 important?
Yes.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.185
Old ammunition
doesn't have as much power,

24:57.220 --> 24:59.529
which means that gravity
pulls it down faster.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.028
Modern bullets
are typically copper-jacketed

25:02.060 --> 25:04.062
so they shoot flatter.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.965
So, in your expert opinion,
is the prosecution

25:06.000 --> 25:07.160
re-creation accurate?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.236
No. Based on my
calculations,

25:09.270 --> 25:12.205
the bullet was ﬁred
not from outside the Rose Salon,

25:12.240 --> 25:13.673
but from here.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.598
ALICIA: And that would be
the Camelia Room?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.005
Yes.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.746
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.812
Uh-oh.

25:24.850 --> 25:27.182
More skeletons in my closet?

25:27.220 --> 25:28.778
One or two.

25:32.090 --> 25:36.925
Let's, uh...
start the dentist's drill.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.088
Do you know the name
Jacob Greenberg?

25:40.130 --> 25:41.199
No.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.060
He used to work
with your father.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.228
Oh, Jake Greenburg. Yes.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.908
They taught together
at law school.

25:47.940 --> 25:48.975
Yeah, until Greenburg

25:49.010 --> 25:50.773
was brought before
the House Committee

25:50.810 --> 25:52.107
on Un-American Activities.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.105
I... I know.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.846
He was accused of being
a Communist sympathizer.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.245
He lost his job

25:57.280 --> 25:58.611
and committed suicide.

25:58.650 --> 26:00.242
Yes.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.781
I-I'm not sure, um...

26:02.820 --> 26:05.152
I mean, what is
this, Kalinda?

26:05.190 --> 26:07.078
My father was
Jake's best friend.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.119
He stood by him.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.127
In fact, he...

26:09.160 --> 26:12.129
he was one of the only
people who stood by him.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.035
At great personal expense.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.094
I know.
So, I...

26:15.140 --> 26:16.266
I don't know
what you think.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.904
Diane, you don't have
to hear this.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.107
Well, will it affect
the judgeship?

26:21.140 --> 26:22.277
I don't know.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.846
It might.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.244
(sighs)

26:26.280 --> 26:29.078
Well, then...
(clears throat) yes.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.109
I mean, tell me.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.948
Private meetings were held
between House Committee

26:32.990 --> 26:34.116
on Un-American Activities

26:34.160 --> 26:37.379
_ and_ several...
influential professors.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.650
And they met
with my father?
Yes.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.191
A-And you're saying that...

26:44.230 --> 26:46.289
that he named Jake?

26:49.140 --> 26:51.199
But that's a rumor, right?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.128
I mean, it was--
there were private meetings,

26:53.170 --> 26:54.239
so there was no...

26:54.280 --> 26:55.975
Minutes were taken.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.145
No... yes.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.181
I... I think we should stop.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.108
Thank you, Kalinda.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.288
Ijust, um...

27:13.330 --> 27:16.254
I need to...

27:19.300 --> 27:22.064
Don't stop
investigating, please.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.965
Okay.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.872
(door opens)

27:34.920 --> 27:36.717
(door closes)

27:36.750 --> 27:38.889
We recall Isobel Swift.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.859
You testified that you
and Mr. Sweeney were

27:45.890 --> 27:49.018
having sex at the moment
he allegedly fired the gun.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.027
Yes.
Would you say

27:50.060 --> 27:52.096
the sex was... pretty wild?

27:52.130 --> 27:54.064
Well... yes.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.738
And this sexual activity
took place

27:55.770 --> 27:57.294
in the Rose Salon?
Actually,

27:57.340 --> 27:59.137
I believe I was mistaken
when I said that.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.172
Upon further reflection,
I remembered we were

28:01.210 --> 28:03.030
actually in the Camelia Room.
WILL: Objection, Your Honor.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.047
Asked and answered.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.809
HELLINGER: The witness
is entitled to change

28:05.850 --> 28:07.044
her testimony
if her recollection

28:07.080 --> 28:08.308
of the events in
question changes.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.147
She's badgering the witness,
Your Honor.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.989
She doesn't look badgered to me.
Overruled.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.749
So, Ms. Swift,
just to be clear,

28:13.790 --> 28:15.849
you're absolutely positive
that the two of you

28:15.890 --> 28:17.824
were in the Camelia Room,

28:17.860 --> 28:19.452
the very room from which
the gun was fired,

28:19.490 --> 28:20.855
according to

28:20.900 --> 28:23.050
the defense's own expert?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.465
Yes.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.936
(laughs)

28:28.970 --> 28:30.289
You were not.

28:30.340 --> 28:31.830
I was.

28:31.870 --> 28:34.077
Six months in juvie.

28:34.110 --> 28:36.476
It was involuntary
manslaughter.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.307
I shot my own brother.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.012
Oh, well, as long as
that's all it was.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.449
It was an accident,
of course.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.118
And it was my dad's
hunﬂn'nﬂe.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.141
How was I supposed
to know it was loaded?

28:46.190 --> 28:48.215
But... judge didn't care.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.751
You can look it up

28:50.790 --> 28:52.348
in the Ohio Department
of Corrections.

28:52.390 --> 28:55.029
Say hello to J479361.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.254
Wow.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.120
A felon.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.126
So, Mr. Fancy
Supreme Court Clerk.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.398
Hmm?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.829
What's it like
helping shape the law?

29:03.870 --> 29:05.098
The truth?

29:05.140 --> 29:06.266
Intoxicating.

29:06.310 --> 29:07.971
I mean, the
breadth of power

29:08.010 --> 29:08.806
those nine people have.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.273
The Mil opinion sure could

29:10.310 --> 29:12.005
make things harder
for criminals with guns.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.176
It's going to. Soon.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.816
Really? You sound like you know
what you're talking about.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.283
Wallace sent over
his reVI5ions for me

29:18.320 --> 29:19.912
to check out-- not
that he changed much.

29:19.950 --> 29:21.110
Wow.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.081
Can I read it?

29:22.120 --> 29:24.384
I'd love to, but that's
against the rules.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.488
Oh.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.179
You can read it in...

29:27.230 --> 29:28.299
40 hours.

29:28.330 --> 29:29.922
(panting): That's
what he said.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.564
Pizza?

29:31.600 --> 29:34.137
Go ahead.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.832
You know, he really
wasn't such a bad guy.

29:36.870 --> 29:37.689
He was_kind
of sen5itive.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.332
He was talking
about Jackson Pollack.

29:39.370 --> 29:40.564
You know Jackson Pollack?

29:40.610 --> 29:41.872
You didn't drive here, did you?

29:41.910 --> 29:42.934
Alicia, it's Cary.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.538
People v. Miles is
coming down in 40 hours.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.548
Give me a call
when you pick this up.

29:46.580 --> 29:47.547
I did not drive;

29:47.580 --> 29:48.877
Ijogged.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.410
You don't like Jackson Pollack?

29:50.450 --> 29:52.008
He was in a car accident.

29:52.050 --> 29:53.085
Yes, I know.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.849
You're really smart.

29:54.890 --> 29:56.585
Let me take you home.
No.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.019
_ Come on.
Time to go home.

29:58.060 --> 30:00.858
I want more pizza.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.322
Okay.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.158
What time is
it, anyway?

30:06.200 --> 30:09.192
(cell phone vibrating)

30:19.450 --> 30:21.441
*

30:48.980 --> 30:50.971
*

30:57.620 --> 31:01.112
I idolized my father.

31:03.990 --> 31:07.050
People are always
more than one thing, Diane.

31:07.090 --> 31:09.092
Maybe.

31:09.130 --> 31:12.964
But if he was a hypocrite,
what does that make me?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.596
I patterned my
life after his.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.403
You patterned your life
after the things

31:18.440 --> 31:19.668
that you admired about him.

31:19.710 --> 31:23.942
You don't_ need to answer for...
Sth you didn't even know about.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.375
You're good at this.

31:27.410 --> 31:29.116
(chuckles)

31:37.620 --> 31:40.555
Why do we keep running
away from each other?

31:42.600 --> 31:44.363
I don't know.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.391
We should get married.

31:48.970 --> 31:50.460
Did I just say that?

31:50.500 --> 31:51.660
You did.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.468
Okay, I'm... I'm in a
transitional place right now,

31:58.510 --> 31:59.977
and I...
(clears throat)

32:00.010 --> 32:01.671
I think I'm just
saying things.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.642
Okay.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.647
Okay.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.545
Well, now I'm embarrassed.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.055
Forget I just said that.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.105
You're sure?

32:26.140 --> 32:27.698
Our intelligence
is pretty good.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.334
The Supreme Court will announce
their decision tomorrow.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.007
Ah.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.217
So... where does
that leave me?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.218
We have to wrap
this case up today.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.579
In other words, I'm screwed.

32:42.620 --> 32:45.350
_ Isobel hurt us
in court yesterday.

32:45.390 --> 32:49.326
There is still time
to turn her around,

32:49.360 --> 32:50.998
but to do that,

32:51.030 --> 32:53.260
I need to know what's going on.

32:55.370 --> 32:58.635
You flatter me,
Mrs. Florrick.

32:58.670 --> 33:02.003
You assume that, like you,
I know and understand

33:02.040 --> 33:05.646
the person I'm romantically
involved with, but...

33:05.680 --> 33:09.116
unfortunately,
I'm not you.

33:09.150 --> 33:09.969
(dance music playing)

33:10.020 --> 33:12.045
(men whooping,
shouting indistinctly)

33:13.720 --> 33:15.051
(gunshot)

33:15.090 --> 33:16.159
(woman screams)

33:16.190 --> 33:17.418
MAN:
Get down! Get down!

33:17.460 --> 33:19.052
(screaming, clamoring)

33:29.240 --> 33:30.730
(door opens)

33:30.770 --> 33:33.659
Uh, so, this is how
this should work.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.405
You come to me saying,
"I discovered

33:35.440 --> 33:36.600
"I was wrong
about your father,

33:36.640 --> 33:39.473
and there's something on this
computer that will prove it."

33:39.510 --> 33:41.341
I'm sorry.

33:42.850 --> 33:45.444
No, let's do it.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.048
We looked at Christmas Past,

33:47.090 --> 33:48.751
we looked at
Christmas Present;

33:48.790 --> 33:50.587
now for Christmas Yet to Come.

33:50.620 --> 33:53.453
Just let me know when
you want me to stop it.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.650
(crowd clamoring, chanting)

33:54.700 --> 33:56.327
McVEIGH:
There's a reason

33:56.360 --> 33:59.397
that those first ten amendments
we passed.

33:59.430 --> 34:00.795
The founding fathers

34:00.830 --> 34:03.264
had firsthand experience
with tyranny.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.531
And I find it curious
that Mr. Obama thinks himself

34:06.570 --> 34:08.800
wiser than Thomas Jefferson

34:08.840 --> 34:12.469
or James Madison when it comes
to my right to bear arms.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.343
Now, is it enough for me to want
to secede from the union?

34:15.380 --> 34:16.278
I don't know.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.312
And-and I hope
I never have to find out.

34:19.350 --> 34:22.808
But I would not stand in the way
of others who wanted to do so,

34:22.860 --> 34:24.088
that much I do know.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.688
(video stops)

34:25.730 --> 34:28.722
Would it be too ironic
to ask you to shoot me?

34:28.760 --> 34:32.161
Look, the problem
is not with the court.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.293
The problem
is with the campaign.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.466
The secession talk.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.138
Yes.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.638
Whatever your relationship
is with McVeigh,

34:39.670 --> 34:41.877
I would advise
that you put it on hold

34:41.910 --> 34:43.377
until you've been appointed.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.380
Six months.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.785
ALICIA:
I know you have

34:52.820 --> 34:54.481
concerns about
Mr. Sweeney's history,

34:54.520 --> 34:55.680
but if your testimony...

34:55.720 --> 34:56.709
His history?

34:56.760 --> 34:57.715
The other day.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.886
You said you had concerns.

34:58.930 --> 34:59.885
Oh, that.

34:59.930 --> 35:00.885
I was kidding.

35:00.930 --> 35:02.249
I'm not worried
about that.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.255
I have every intention

35:03.300 --> 35:04.892
of being Mrs. Colin Sweeney.

35:04.930 --> 35:05.897
Then...

35:05.930 --> 35:07.295
I don't want a prenup.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.864
Colin's insisting
on one.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.231
So that's why...

35:11.270 --> 35:13.431
I lied in court, yeah.

35:13.470 --> 35:16.803
Tell him to forget the prenup,
and I'll be good.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.741
You know, I think I was
wrong about your hair.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.247
It looks good.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.872
Thanks.

35:23.850 --> 35:24.817
RO BYN :
Greg.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.886
What are you doing here?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.683
Well, I couldn't get you
to return my texts,

35:28.720 --> 35:29.914
so I thought
I'd try you in person.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.518
Oh.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.857
Bad hangover.
Yeah.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.551
Mine's pretty bad, too.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.228
Look, I know what you were
after last night.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.659
What do you mean?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.565
I was after a good time.
Yeah.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.238
I saw the coverage
of the Sweeney case,

35:42.270 --> 35:44.909
and I looked you up, too;
you never passed the bar.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.601
(laughs)

35:48.640 --> 35:49.834
Sorry.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.268
(sighs)

35:53.310 --> 35:56.939
The Miles opinion comes
out today at 5:00 pm.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.187
The chief justice has
a wedding in Bermuda,

35:59.220 --> 36:00.619
and he wants
the extra day.

36:00.650 --> 36:01.651
Uh-oh.
Yeah.

36:01.690 --> 36:02.486
So I'd hurry.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.557
Uh...

36:05.590 --> 36:06.921
Thank you, Greg.

36:06.960 --> 36:07.949
You're welcome.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.628
(chuckles)
Hey.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.469
Can I see you again?

36:11.500 --> 36:14.537
No. But... thanks.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.867
CREED: _
The lamp you're referring to

36:17.900 --> 36:19.834
was classic Tiffany style.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.474
The glass was shattered
in the tumult.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.977
But we had each
individual pane

36:23.010 --> 36:24.546
replaced in the original frame.

36:24.580 --> 36:25.569
Here is it.

36:25.610 --> 36:26.838
That's the one.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.871
See?

36:29.920 --> 36:30.875
The lamp was intact.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.979
Yeah. It got
knocked over.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.681
No, it was hit.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.880
Ricochet.

36:39.290 --> 36:40.848
MAN:
Sir.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.755
Oh, uh, excuse me.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.492
Don't be
embarrassed, Diane.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.495
I'm...

36:49.540 --> 36:50.996
I'm not rejecting it.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.462
Rejecting what?

36:52.510 --> 36:53.659
Marriage.

36:53.710 --> 36:54.972
Ijust...

36:55.010 --> 36:57.934
need time to think.

37:05.050 --> 37:05.948
Point of ricochet.

37:05.990 --> 37:06.945
Meaning?

37:06.990 --> 37:08.810
As much as I hate to say it,

37:08.860 --> 37:10.680
your guy's still innocent.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.019
I based part of my calculations
on witness testimony,

37:14.060 --> 37:17.552
_ which of course is
inherently unreliable,

37:17.600 --> 37:18.919
unlike physical evidence.

37:18.970 --> 37:19.959
I...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.934
Here, you can see that

37:21.970 --> 37:23.460
the lamp is still intact.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.809
It was standing on
the opposite side of the room

37:25.840 --> 37:27.933
from the doorway into
the Camelia Room.

37:27.970 --> 37:30.438
The club thought it was broken
in the melee at the party,

37:30.480 --> 37:32.903
which is why it was excluded
from the crime scene evidence.

37:32.950 --> 37:33.905
But it wasn't broken
in the melee?

37:33.950 --> 37:35.315
No. It was shot at.

37:35.350 --> 37:36.510
Objection. Foundation.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.438
Defense Exhibit K, Your Honor.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.617
It's an affidavit from the
manager of the Hirschorn Club,

37:40.650 --> 37:42.379
verifying the
provenance of the lamp.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.717
Mr. McVeigh, can you tell us...

37:43.760 --> 37:45.318
POLITI:
Counselor? Excuse me.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.622
I have to rule.

37:46.660 --> 37:47.820
Uh, yes, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.319
Overruled.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.725
Can you tell

37:51.770 --> 37:53.897
the court what that mark
is on the lampshade?

37:53.930 --> 37:55.932
It's a nick, consistent
with being hit by a bullet.

37:55.970 --> 37:57.062
And does this change
your original conclusion?

37:57.100 --> 37:59.432
Yes, it means that the shooter
also had to be standing

37:59.470 --> 38:02.303
on the opposite side of the room
from the Camelia Room doorway.

38:02.340 --> 38:03.568
You mean, where the witness,
Michael Catalani,

38:03.610 --> 38:04.872
testified he was standing?

38:04.910 --> 38:05.979
Given the physics involved, yes.

38:06.010 --> 38:07.546
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Objection.

38:07.580 --> 38:08.205
To?

38:08.250 --> 38:09.649
Something two questions ago.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.942
S-Speculation.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.538
Oh, okay.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.340
(chuckles)

38:13.390 --> 38:14.709
Overruled.
WILL:
Nothing further,

38:14.760 --> 38:16.318
Your Honor. And
no more Witnesses.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.315
Defense rests.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.258
We have our submission ready.

38:18.290 --> 38:20.485
Okay, sure.
You're excused, Mr. McVeigh.

38:20.530 --> 38:21.997
Go ahead, Counselor.

38:22.030 --> 38:23.497
We're ready for
your summation.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.326
The evidence proves
that Mr. Colin Sweeney

38:27.370 --> 38:28.962
did not shoot the
gun, Your Honor.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.639
He's innocent.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.638
POLITI:
Good.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.570
I like this new way
to conduct trials.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.819
(knocks)

38:47.850 --> 38:49.556
Hi again.

38:49.590 --> 38:51.979
Hello.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.055
Dropping off your invoice?

38:57.130 --> 38:59.098
Sorry.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.564
It's been an odd series of days.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.363
Any word?

39:03.400 --> 39:05.800
No. Judge Politi's
still deliberating.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.705
I wish I could say
"good luck" on that.

39:07.740 --> 39:08.536
(chuckles)

39:08.580 --> 39:11.071
Sweeney's a hard man
to cheer for.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.348
I think we should wait
and think about marriage.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.094
I don't know.

39:29.130 --> 39:31.621
I worry we'll always be waiting.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.090
Maybe that's fine.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.131
I'll talk to you.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.775
Wait.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.710
I don't want to wait.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.149
Please.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.721
I don't want to wait.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.920
I don't.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.018
And then what?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.103
So, I've arrived
at a decision.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.472
And unfortunately,
Ms. Hellinger,

40:15.510 --> 40:17.603
I find that there simply
isn't enough evidence

40:17.640 --> 40:20.643
to prove the gun charge
against Mr. Sweeney.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.911
Accordingly, I must find him
not guilty on this charge.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.679
However, Mr. Sweeney,

40:25.720 --> 40:27.187
you're pretty much a scumbag.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.780
I know I'll probably
get censured for that,

40:29.820 --> 40:31.082
but I really don't care.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.485
I do find you guilty

40:32.530 --> 40:33.781
of disorderly conduct,

40:33.830 --> 40:35.718
and I sentence you
to a $1,500 fine,

40:35.760 --> 40:38.194
30 days incarceration

40:38.230 --> 40:39.868
to be served immediately.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.629
We're done here.

40:41.670 --> 40:42.967
Thank God.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.968
(gavelbangs)

40:45.010 --> 40:46.136
Thank you.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.137
Again.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.774
You still have
to serve 30 days.

40:48.810 --> 40:49.777
I know, but, uh...

40:49.810 --> 40:51.038
at least I have something

40:51.080 --> 40:53.207
to look forward to
on my release.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.878
So, you decided no prenup?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.649
I love her too much.

40:59.690 --> 41:00.918
She's going to cheat you.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.850
I know. It's okay.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.209
I'll just kill her.

41:04.260 --> 41:07.058
* Once again,
it's happening... *

41:07.090 --> 41:07.954
I'll wait for you.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.218
I know, love.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.625
Can he have these?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.758
* Oh...

41:13.800 --> 41:15.688
Hold 'em for me.

41:15.740 --> 41:20.666
* This love is unrequited

41:20.710 --> 41:23.099
* Twice the pain

41:23.140 --> 41:27.076
* The suffering

41:29.080 --> 41:30.877
*Oh

41:30.920 --> 41:36.916
* My love is unrequited

41:36.960 --> 41:39.986
* Oh, my love is unrequited...

41:40.030 --> 41:42.021
(line ringing)

41:44.600 --> 41:45.897
WILL:
Hello.

41:45.930 --> 41:47.522
Will, are you busy?

41:47.570 --> 41:49.231
Um, no. What's up?

41:49.270 --> 41:51.636
Nothing, um,
just something with work.

41:51.670 --> 41:53.035
HELLINGER (in background):
What is going on?

41:53.070 --> 41:54.901
Are you guys trying to save
on electricity?

41:54.940 --> 41:56.271
I will call you back.

41:56.310 --> 41:58.175
I'm fine.

41:58.210 --> 42:01.668
* And get back
what I gave my men *

42:01.720 --> 42:02.778
* Get back...

42:02.820 --> 42:03.912
Who was that, Alicia?

42:03.950 --> 42:04.939
Yeah.

42:09.590 --> 42:11.558
* Oh, the shame

42:11.590 --> 42:15.253
* This crying game

42:17.300 --> 42:20.064
* Oh, my love...

42:20.100 --> 42:21.567
Yes?

42:21.600 --> 42:24.091
I'm not being honest.

42:24.140 --> 42:25.232
You're not?

42:25.270 --> 42:28.068
No, and I should be.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.805
(clears throat)

42:29.840 --> 42:33.298
There was a guy I dated
in the military.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.877
He's recently come back
into my life.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.273
Oh.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.288
I'm sorry, but I...

42:40.320 --> 42:42.151
No, no. Hey.
No, I get it.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.787
Congratulations.

42:45.830 --> 42:46.956
For?

42:46.990 --> 42:48.753
The case.

42:50.030 --> 42:54.126
* Oh, my love

42:54.170 --> 42:57.890
* Is unrequited

42:57.940 --> 43:01.671
* Oh, my love

43:01.710 --> 43:04.838
* Is unrequited...
