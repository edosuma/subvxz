WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:03.604
A PROPOSAL WAS MADE...

00:03.604 --> 00:05.036
YOUR NIECE CAME
TO MY RESTAURANT,

00:05.036 --> 00:06.477
ASKED ME
FOR A HOSTESSING JOB.

00:06.477 --> 00:09.180
I'M SORRY.
 ANOTHER WAS BROKEN.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.142
OH, KATHERINE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
 MIKE, PLEASE.

00:11.142 --> 00:13.114
A SECRET WAS KEPT...

00:13.114 --> 00:15.015
CARLOS IS GONNA FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS THING EVENTUALLY.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.450
BY THEN, I WILL HAVE PROVED I
CAN DO THE JOB, PREGNANT OR NOT.

00:19.450 --> 00:23.294
SHE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.
I'D LIKE TO RUN SOME TESTS.
 ANOTHER REVEALED...

00:23.294 --> 00:25.196
JULIE'S PREGNANT.

00:30.801 --> 00:33.804
(Mary Alice) BREE VAN DE KAMP
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

00:33.804 --> 00:36.036
AND WHENEVER
HER LOVER CALLED...

00:36.036 --> 00:37.368
(cell phone alert chimes)

00:39.470 --> 00:43.644
SHE NEEDED AN EXCUSE
TO LEAVE WORK EARLY.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.247
I'M OFF TO THE JEWELER'S.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.650
GOTTA GET
MY PEARLS RESTRUNG.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.652
I'M OFF TO THE SALON.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.685
GOTTA KEEP
THIS RED HAIR RED.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.388
I HAVE TO VISIT MY AUNT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:57.388 --> 01:00.591
SHE HAS SHINGLES.

01:00.591 --> 01:03.194
BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY,

01:03.194 --> 01:05.396
BREE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND

01:05.396 --> 01:09.300
HER WORK HAD BEEN DONE FOR HER.

01:11.102 --> 01:13.444
MORNING!
 KATHERINE, IT'S BARELY 9:00.

01:13.444 --> 01:15.446
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN COOKING?

01:15.446 --> 01:18.379
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
SINCE 3:00? 4:00?

01:18.379 --> 01:21.081
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO
THIS WHOLE LUNCHEON BY YOURSELF.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.713
WELL, I DON'T MIND.

01:22.713 --> 01:24.715
WHEN I'M HAPPY,
I HAVE ALL THIS EXCESS ENERGY.

01:24.715 --> 01:26.357
GOTTA CHANNEL IT SOMEWHERE.

01:26.357 --> 01:28.859
OH, YOU MUST BE
PRETTY DARN HAPPY.

01:28.859 --> 01:30.521
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?

01:30.521 --> 01:32.693
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.365
I'M IN LOVE.

01:34.365 --> 01:35.866
(gasps) THAT'S WONDERFUL!

01:35.866 --> 01:38.369
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE SEEING SOMEONE?

01:38.369 --> 01:40.371
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:40.371 --> 01:42.873
THE MAIN THING IS
YOU'RE FINALLY OVER MIKE.

01:42.873 --> 01:45.206
I'M NOT OVER MIKE.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.878
(scoffs) YOU'RE NOT?

01:47.878 --> 01:51.542
NO, SILLY. WHO'D YOU THINK
I WAS IN LOVE WITH?

01:51.542 --> 01:54.745
BUT MIKE JUST MARRIED SUSAN.

01:54.745 --> 01:58.289
OH, HONEY. THEIR FIRST MARRIAGE
WENT DOWN IN FLAMES.

01:58.289 --> 02:00.521
THIS ONE'S GONNA CRASH
EVEN FASTER.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.893
(whispers) THEY'RE NOT EVEN
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

02:02.893 --> 02:05.256
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

02:05.256 --> 02:06.757
LAST NIGHT,

02:06.757 --> 02:10.201
THE LIGHT IN THEIR UPSTAIRS DEN
WAS ON AT 3:00 A.M.

02:10.201 --> 02:11.662
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

02:11.662 --> 02:14.635
MAYBE SUSAN WANTED TO READ
WITHOUT WAKING HIM.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.908
NO. MIKE MADE A MISTAKE
AND HE KNOWS IT.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.611
HE'S JUST WAITING FOR JULIE
TO FEEL BETTER,

02:20.611 --> 02:24.275
AND THEN HE'LL DUMP SUSAN
AND BEG ME TO TAKE HIM BACK.

02:26.217 --> 02:29.450
SO... GRAB AN APRON.
WE STILL HAVE DESSERT TO MAKE.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.224
I'M THINKING TARTE TATIN.

02:33.224 --> 02:36.327
IT'S MIKE'S FAVORITE.
WE'LL MAKE AN EXTRA ONE FOR HIM.

02:36.327 --> 02:38.359
POOR BREE.

02:38.359 --> 02:42.233
SHE WANTED TO HELP HER FRIEND.
 (cell phone alert chimes)

02:44.235 --> 02:46.237
BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME

02:46.237 --> 02:49.200
TO DEAL WITH
KATHERINE'S IMAGINARY LOVER...

02:49.200 --> 02:54.205
(gasps) I HAVE A TEETH CLEANING,
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

02:54.205 --> 03:08.589
NOT WHEN SHE HAD A REAL ONE.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.921
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT
TO LOOK AT HIM,

03:10.921 --> 03:13.724
BUT THAT NICE MAN
WHO DELIVERS YOUR MAIL

03:13.724 --> 03:16.196
HITS HIS WIFE.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.869
YOU'D NEVER GUESS BY HER SMILE,

03:18.869 --> 03:21.702
BUT THAT NICE WOMAN
ACROSS THE STREET

03:21.702 --> 03:25.336
EMBEZZLES FROM HER BOSS.

03:25.336 --> 03:29.610
AND THAT ATTRACTIVE COUPLE
WHO JOGS BY EVERY MORNING?

03:29.610 --> 03:34.615
WELL, THEY LIKE THEIR COCAINE.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.916
THE SAD TRUTH IS,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.619
WE DON'T KNOW OUR FRIENDS
AND NEIGHBORS

03:38.619 --> 03:41.622
NEARLY AS WELL
AS WE THINK WE DO.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.995
EVEN THE PEOPLE WE LOVE...

03:44.995 --> 03:47.358
KEEP SECRETS.

03:47.358 --> 03:49.530
(grunts) NEED COFFEE.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.702
(chuckles)
 MMM.

03:51.702 --> 03:54.004
WELL, THIS ISN'T HELPING YOU
GET YOUR COFFEE. (laughs)

03:54.004 --> 03:56.607
WHATEVER.
IT'S WAKIN' ME UP.

03:56.607 --> 03:58.609
(spoon clanks loudly)
 (both laugh)

03:58.609 --> 04:00.941
HEY, BUD. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOIN' HOME?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.914
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A MORNING CLASS.

04:03.914 --> 04:06.917
ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING
ABOUT QUITTING SCHOOL.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.019
WHAT?

04:09.019 --> 04:11.822
YEAH. I THOUGHT I MIGHT
GET A JOB.

04:11.822 --> 04:15.426
DANNY, OUR FAMILY'S BEEN IN
THIS COUNTRY FIVE GENERATIONS.

04:15.426 --> 04:17.887
IT'S TIME ONE OF US
GOT A DIPLOMA.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.962
(sighs)
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:21.962 --> 04:24.435
TALK TO ME.

04:24.435 --> 04:29.540
NO ONE TALKS TO ME AT SCHOOL,
NO ONE SITS NEAR ME,

04:29.540 --> 04:32.272
AND EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M THE PERV WHO ATTACKED JULIE.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.380
LOOK, THIS IS
A TEMPORARY THING.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.982
THE POLICE ARE GONNA
CATCH THIS GUY,

04:41.982 --> 04:44.615
AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW
YOU ARE INNOCENT.

04:44.615 --> 04:47.017
YEAH, BUT MEANWHILE,
I'M THE CAMPUS FREAK.

04:47.017 --> 04:50.020
BABY, DO ME A FAVOR.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.022
IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL TODAY,

04:52.022 --> 04:55.295
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
WHEN YOU GET HOME, OKAY?

04:56.867 --> 04:57.998
OKAY.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.530
(whispers) OKAY.

05:05.676 --> 05:07.678
WHY YOU BEING SO NICE TO HIM?

05:07.678 --> 05:11.081
THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE
LETTIN' HIM DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

05:11.081 --> 05:12.943
I KNOW THAT,

05:12.943 --> 05:14.945
BUT WE HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL HERE.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.447
YOU KNOW DANNY--

05:16.447 --> 05:18.619
WHEN HE GETS UNHAPPY,
HE GETS SLOPPY,

05:18.619 --> 05:20.921
SAYS ALL SORTS OF THINGS
HE SHOULDN'T.

05:22.793 --> 05:24.755
OKAY.

05:24.755 --> 05:26.757
SO NOW ALL WE'VE GOTTA DO

05:26.757 --> 05:29.930
IS FIGURE OUT HOW
TO MAKE A TEENAGER HAPPY.

05:32.363 --> 05:33.634
DAMN IT!

05:33.634 --> 05:35.035
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.037
OH. (scoffs) NOTHING FITS.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.771
MY BREASTS
HAVE GOTTEN HUGE.

05:40.771 --> 05:43.814
OH, YEAH. I HATE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

05:43.814 --> 05:45.816
EVERY TIME I'M PREGNANT--

05:45.816 --> 05:48.919
SECOND TRIMESTER
LIKE CLOCKWORK. BAM!

05:50.350 --> 05:51.922
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

05:51.922 --> 05:53.924
(chuckles) WHY DO YOU THINK?

05:53.924 --> 05:55.926
"THE SUPREMES" ARE BACK.

05:55.926 --> 06:00.060
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT NAMING
THEM AFTER MUSICAL GROUPS?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.592
I KNOW.

06:01.592 --> 06:03.764
IT'S JUST THAT
"BENNY AND THE JETS"

06:03.764 --> 06:05.896
ARE SO HAPPY TO SEE 'EM.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.939
THIS IS SERIOUS.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.941
I HAVE TO HIDE
THESE THINGS AT WORK

06:10.941 --> 06:12.943
SO CARLOS DOESN'T FIND OUT
I'M PREGNANT.

06:12.943 --> 06:14.945
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH YOU GUYS?

06:14.945 --> 06:17.978
I GOT SOME IDEAS.
 HEY, HEY, I GOT A MEETING.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.980
WAIT, BUT--BUT--BUT--BUT THEY'RE
ONLY LIKE THIS FOR TWO WEEKS

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
UNTIL THEY GET ALL SORE,

06:21.982 --> 06:25.155
AND YOU GIVE ME
THAT "DON'T TOUCH ME" LOOK.
 (sighs) OKAY. GOOD-BYE, TOM.

06:25.155 --> 06:28.158
OH, COME ON. NO, LYNETTE,
COME ON. CALL IN SICK.

06:28.158 --> 06:30.160
KIDS GET SNOW DAYS.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.164
WE COULD CALL IT A BOOB DAY.

06:34.164 --> 06:38.068
OKAY, IT IS WAY TOO EARLY
FOR THE "DON'T TOUCH ME" LOOK.

06:41.872 --> 06:43.934
SO I WAITED AROUND
ALL MORNING, CARLOS,

06:43.934 --> 06:47.478
FOR THAT REPAIRMAN THAT YOU TOLD
ME TO CALL, AND HE NEVER SHOWED.

06:47.478 --> 06:50.581
NO, I'M NOT DONE.
I'M SHARING MY DAY WITH YOU.

06:50.581 --> 06:53.083
THEN YOUR CHILDREN TOOK
MY $300 PERFUME

06:53.083 --> 06:55.946
AND GAVE THEIR DOLLS A BATH.

06:55.946 --> 07:01.021
YES, I SPENT $300 ON PERFUME.
BUT YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT!

07:01.021 --> 07:03.454
OH, REALLY?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I YELL?

07:03.454 --> 07:05.456
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

07:07.898 --> 07:10.200
I HAVE TAKEN CARE
OF YOUR DEMON SPAWN CHILDREN

07:10.200 --> 07:12.202
FOR 12 HOURS.
MY SHIFT IS OVER.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.865
(beep, slams down receiver)
 (sighs)

07:18.739 --> 07:20.741
(car door shuts)
 (sighs)

07:22.813 --> 07:25.646
SO, YOU, UH, HAVING FUN
WORKING AT THE RESTAURANT?

07:25.646 --> 07:28.218
I'M HAVING FUN
WORKING WITH YOU.

07:28.218 --> 07:31.021
OH! LOOK WHO'S HERE.

07:31.021 --> 07:33.624
HI, GABRIELLE.
 I WAS TALKING TO HER.

07:33.624 --> 07:36.527
SO... I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
PICK YOU UP.

07:36.527 --> 07:38.529
JOHN OFFERED
TO GIVE ME A RIDE.

07:38.529 --> 07:40.791
AND I APPRECIATED THE COMPANY.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.963
OKAY, TIME TO GO INSIDE.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.995
SOMEONE'S GOT HOMEWORK.

07:44.995 --> 07:46.196
BYE.
 NIGHT.

07:48.499 --> 07:50.000
YOU REMEMBER HOMEWORK,
JOHN--

07:50.000 --> 07:52.703
THAT THING THAT KIDS
IN HIGH SCHOOL HAVE TO DO?

07:52.703 --> 07:56.206
I REMEMBER IT. I THINK YOU USED
TO HELP ME WITH MINE.

07:56.206 --> 07:59.880
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HER,
JOHN?
 I TAKE CARE OF MY EMPLOYEES.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.153
REALLY? DO YOU DRIVE
THE BUSBOYS HOME, TOO?

08:03.153 --> 08:05.485
I WILL PICK HER UP
FROM NOW ON.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.158
(scoffs) COME ON.

08:09.259 --> 08:10.961
HEY THERE.

08:10.961 --> 08:12.963
HOW'S SHE DOING?
 MUCH BETTER.

08:12.963 --> 08:15.726
THE DOCTOR SAYS THE SWELLING
IN HER BRAIN HAS SUBSIDED

08:15.726 --> 08:18.869
AND SHE COULD COME TO
AT ANY MOMENT.
 WELL, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

08:18.869 --> 08:21.872
MM. JULIE, YOU SHOULD SEE
THE FLOWERS ANDREW BROUGHT YOU.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.133
THEY'RE GORGEOUS.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.135
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

08:25.135 --> 08:28.108
JULIE KNOWS HOW I FEEL
ABOUT HER. DON'T YOU, JULES?

08:28.108 --> 08:31.011
I LOVE THAT YOU TWO HAVE
STAYED FRIENDS ALL THESE YEARS.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.143
YEAH, WELL,
WE--WE KIND OF LOST TOUCH

08:33.143 --> 08:35.184
WHEN SHE WAS IN MED SCHOOL,

08:35.184 --> 08:38.018
BUT--BUT EVER SINCE SHE QUIT...
I MEAN, WE TALK ALL THE TIME.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.520
SHE QUIT MED SCHOOL?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.624
I-I THOUGHT SHE TOLD YOU.
IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.856
SHE'S BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL
FOR SIX MONTHS?

08:45.856 --> 08:49.129
(lowered voice) YOU ARE SO LUCKY
YOU'RE IN A COMA RIGHT NOW.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.562
WHAT HAS SHE BEEN DOING
ALL THIS TIME?

08:51.562 --> 08:53.904
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE
WANTED TO DO WITH HER LIFE,

08:53.904 --> 08:56.036
SO WHILE SHE WAS DECIDING,
SHE GOT HERSELF A JOB...

08:56.036 --> 08:58.038
(lowered voice)
WAITING TABLES.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.142
DID YOU JUST SAY
"WAITING TABLES"?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.044
(normal voice) I THOUGHT SHE--
 TOLD ME?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.046
YEAH, NO, SHE DIDN'T.
(forced laugh)

09:06.046 --> 09:08.078
THIS IS UNREAL.

09:08.078 --> 09:11.952
YESTERDAY, I FOUND OUT
JULIE THOUGHT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.955
AND NOW I'M FINDING OUT
THAT MY DAUGHTER THE SURGEON

09:14.955 --> 09:18.058
IS ACTUALLY MY DAUGHTER
THE... (chuckles) WAITRESS.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.031
I'M GONNA NEED A MOMENT.

09:21.031 --> 09:23.233
TAKE YOUR TIME.
I'LL--I'LL JUST...
 WAIT!

09:23.233 --> 09:25.696
THE GUY.
 WHAT GUY?

09:25.696 --> 09:27.838
JULIE WAS SEEING SOME GUY.

09:27.838 --> 09:30.641
YOU TWO TALK ALL THE TIME.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.743
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

09:32.743 --> 09:35.005
NOW WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT TIME
TO WAKE UP AND HELP ME.

09:35.005 --> 09:38.108
ANDREW, WHO IS HE?

09:38.108 --> 09:40.280
HE MAY BE THE ONE
THAT ATTACKED HER.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.715
ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUY,
BUT I-I-I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.
 OH, PLEASE.

09:44.715 --> 09:47.758
WHY WOULD SHE TELL YOU SHE WAS
SEEING SOMEONE AND NOT SAY WHO?

09:47.758 --> 09:49.660
BECAUSE HE'S MARRIED.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.002
(front door closes)
 WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.003
MINTS.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.935
MINTS?

10:04.935 --> 10:07.678
(crinkles)
 MINTS THAT ARE...

10:07.678 --> 10:09.810
"RIBBED FOR HER PLEASURE"?!

10:09.810 --> 10:13.083
YEAH, WE FOUND A WHOLE BOX
OF THEM UNDER ANA'S BED.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.885
ANA!

10:14.885 --> 10:16.747
CAN I HAVE ONE
BEFORE DINNER?

10:16.747 --> 10:18.749
NO! NO, YOU CAN'T EAT THESE!

10:18.749 --> 10:21.952
THESE AREN'T MINTS.
THEY'RE... BALLOONS.

10:21.952 --> 10:23.824
YAY!
 (crinkling)

10:23.824 --> 10:26.056
GROWNUP BALLOONS.

10:26.056 --> 10:28.899
DO YOU AND DADDY
PLAY WITH THEM?

10:28.899 --> 10:32.032
IF WE DID, YOU AND I WOULDN'T
BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.135
NICE KNOCK.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.067
WHAT ARE THESE?

10:37.067 --> 10:39.169
WELL, THOSE ARE CONDOMS.

10:39.169 --> 10:41.071
YOU SEE, WHEN A BOY AND A GIRL
LIKE EACH OTHER--

10:41.071 --> 10:44.114
SHUT IT. JUANITA AND CELIA
FOUND THESE UNDER YOUR BED.

10:44.114 --> 10:47.117
OKAY, I WANT A LOCK
ON MY DOOR.
 I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

10:47.117 --> 10:50.951
THAT IS NOT WHERE THE LOCK
IS GONNA GO.
 THIS IS REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.424
SORRY. 17 PLUS CONDOMS?
 TOTALLY MY BUSINESS.

10:54.424 --> 10:57.788
WHAT'S THE STORY? ARE YOU
SLEEPING WITH JOHN ROWLAND?

10:57.788 --> 10:59.830
AUNT GABY, HE'S MY BOSS.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.162
AH! AND THE OSCAR GOES TO...

11:02.162 --> 11:03.133
NOT YOU.

11:03.133 --> 11:06.066
(sighs) OKAY, FINE.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.039
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING...

11:09.039 --> 11:10.140
YET.

11:10.140 --> 11:12.372
"YET"? WHY IS THERE A "YET"?
 I LOVE HIM.

11:14.845 --> 11:18.078
DID YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID I LOVE HIM.

11:18.078 --> 11:22.713
I HEARD YOU.
I WAS SWALLOWING VOMIT.

11:22.713 --> 11:25.115
YOU AND JOHN--
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

11:25.115 --> 11:27.387
WHAT IS IT ABOUT JOHN
THAT GETS YOU SO CRAZY?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.389
HE WAS JUST YOUR GARDENER.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.292
I'M NOT CRAZY!
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.098
I PROMISED THE GIRLS

11:38.098 --> 11:42.202
THEY COULD FILL THESE WITH WATER
AND DROP THEM OFF THE ROOF.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.404
(man) COME ON, KIDS.
LET'S GO!

11:44.404 --> 11:47.838
HEY, PORTER.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

11:47.838 --> 11:49.139
HEY, MRS. BOLEN.

11:49.139 --> 11:52.182
UH, SORRY. I'VE GOTTA
GO PICK UP PENNY FROM SCHOOL.

11:52.182 --> 11:53.884
(sighs)

11:57.017 --> 11:59.219
(thud)

11:59.219 --> 12:00.720
WHOA!

12:00.720 --> 12:03.153
THIS'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

12:03.153 --> 12:04.795
OKAY.

12:04.795 --> 12:07.798
SO, UH, THIS FRIDAY NIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU HELP ME

12:07.798 --> 12:10.100
THROW DANNY A LITTLE PARTY
AT OUR PLACE?

12:10.100 --> 12:13.103
A PARTY?
 YEAH. HE NEEDS
TO MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

12:13.103 --> 12:14.765
HE'S A LITTLE SHY,

12:14.765 --> 12:16.767
AND THIS WHOLE THING WITH JULIE
HAS NOT HELPED.

12:16.767 --> 12:20.010
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.
DANNY AND I DON'T HANG OUT.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.012
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH IN COMMON.

12:22.012 --> 12:23.844
WELL... DANNY LIKES MONEY.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.315
DO YOU LIKE MONEY?

12:25.315 --> 12:27.818
SURE.

12:27.818 --> 12:30.220
SEE? YOU DO HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.152
ARE YOU BRIBING ME?

12:32.152 --> 12:34.785
NO. THIS IS TO PAY
FOR THE PARTY.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.287
AND, OF COURSE, IF THERE'S
A LITTLE LEFT OVER...

12:37.287 --> 12:38.458
OH.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.991
AND I ALMOST FORGOT.

12:40.991 --> 12:43.994
YOU CAN'T HAVE A PARTY
WITHOUT BEER.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.996
OKAY, IS THIS A TRICK?

12:45.996 --> 12:48.768
IS MY MOTHER HIDING
IN THE BUSHES

12:48.768 --> 12:51.541
TO SEE IF I TAKE THE BAIT?
 I JUST WANT HIM
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

12:51.541 --> 12:54.204
SO MAKE SURE YOU INVITE
SOME NICE PEOPLE,

12:54.204 --> 12:56.406
MAYBE A COUPLE OF CUTE GIRLS.

12:56.406 --> 12:59.249
ANYTHING
FOR MY GOOD FRIEND DANNY.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.784
ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

13:04.784 --> 13:08.158
IT'S A LOVELY 4-TIER CAKE
WITH PINK FONDANT.

13:08.158 --> 13:09.860
HMM.

13:09.860 --> 13:12.122
OKAY. (clears throat)

13:12.122 --> 13:14.324
WELL, AFTER SHOWING YOU
43 CAKE DESIGNS,

13:14.324 --> 13:16.927
I'VE LEARNED THAT "HMM"
MEANS "NO."

13:16.927 --> 13:19.229
BUT YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN TWO DAYS,

13:19.229 --> 13:21.231
SO UNLESS YOU WANNA SHOVE
WEDDING JELL-O

13:21.231 --> 13:23.303
INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES, YOU
REALLY NEED TO MAKE A DECISION.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.306
OH, I'M SORRY. WE JUST WANT
EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT AND--

13:26.306 --> 13:28.338
OOH! (gasps)

13:28.338 --> 13:30.280
WHAT'S THIS ONE?

13:30.280 --> 13:33.283
OH, THIS MUST BE A NEW DESIGN
BY MY PARTNER KATHERINE.

13:33.283 --> 13:34.885
YOU LIKE IT?

13:34.885 --> 13:36.246
I LOVE IT.

13:36.246 --> 13:38.348
(whispers) WONDERFUL.

13:38.348 --> 13:40.991
NOW...
WHAT FLAVOR DO YOU WANT?

13:40.991 --> 13:42.452
I WOULD SUGGEST

13:42.452 --> 13:44.494
A CLASSIC WHITE CAKE
WITH RASPBERRY GENOISE.

13:44.494 --> 13:47.197
HMM.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.828
HMM.

13:48.828 --> 13:53.003
(telephone rings,
indistinct conversations)

13:53.003 --> 13:56.836
HEY, CARLOS, NOTICE ANYTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT LYNETTE?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.838
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.912
CHECK HER OUT IN THIS PHOTO FROM
THE CHRISTMAS PARTY LAST YEAR.

14:01.912 --> 14:04.014
BEFORE...

14:04.014 --> 14:05.976
AFTER.

14:05.976 --> 14:08.278
WHOA.

14:08.278 --> 14:10.150
LYNETTE GOT IMPLANTS.

14:10.150 --> 14:14.254
DEFINITELY.
AND LOOK AT THOSE PUPPIES.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.256
WAIT A MINUTE.
AREN'T YOU GAY?

14:16.256 --> 14:19.389
YOU CAN'T ASK ME THAT.
 WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT,

14:19.389 --> 14:21.391
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE

14:21.391 --> 14:23.994
FOR CHECKING OUT
MY MARRIED FRIEND.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.235
(laughs nervously) SO GAY!

14:25.235 --> 14:26.636
JUDY-LIZA-BARBRA GAY!

14:26.636 --> 14:29.039
(singsong voice)
PROUD MEMBER SINCE '89!

14:33.443 --> 14:35.445
SO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER,

14:35.445 --> 14:40.250
NET INCOME INCREASED BY 20%
COMPARED TO...

14:40.250 --> 14:42.252
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

14:42.252 --> 14:46.116
SORRY, LYNETTE.
I JUST... (sighs)

14:46.116 --> 14:48.118
I KNOW.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.390
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.092
YOUR LITTLE SECRET.

14:52.092 --> 14:57.297
OH, GOD,
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TWINS?

14:57.297 --> 15:00.470
WELL, I MEAN, YEAH.
I HAVE EYES.

15:00.470 --> 15:03.203
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THIS WAS NOT PLANNED.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.175
IT WASN'T?

15:05.175 --> 15:07.177
GOD, NO!
TOM AND I WENT OUT TO DINNER,

15:07.177 --> 15:09.539
HE GOT ME DRUNK,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW...

15:09.539 --> 15:11.241
AH.

15:11.241 --> 15:13.683
SO TOM'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS.

15:13.683 --> 15:16.486
WELL... WHO ELSE?

15:16.486 --> 15:19.219
GOD,
YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD WIFE.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.221
I WISH YOU'D TALK TO GABY,

15:21.221 --> 15:26.056
GET HER TO JUMP
ON THE BANDWAGON.
 DOESN'T GABY
ALREADY HAVE HER HANDS FULL

15:26.056 --> 15:30.130
WITH THE TWO SHE'S GOT?
 MNH, THEY'RE OKAY. I ALWAYS
THOUGHT WE COULD DO BETTER.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.203
WHAT?!
 YOU KNOW, GABY REALLY
LOOKS UP TO YOU.

15:33.203 --> 15:37.207
IF SHE KNEW YOU GOT A BOOB JOB,
SHE MIGHT CONSIDER IT.

15:37.207 --> 15:39.169
BOOB JOB?

15:39.169 --> 15:41.071
SORRY. BREAST ENHANCEMENT.

15:41.071 --> 15:43.313
JUST GIVE HER
THE NAME OF YOUR DOCTOR.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.415
HE DID GREAT WORK.

15:45.415 --> 15:48.018
OH! OH.

15:48.018 --> 15:50.250
OH, NOW I... (laughs)

15:50.250 --> 15:52.722
O-OKAY. GOT IT.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.354
SURE.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.357
BY THE WAY,
LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.529
DON'T TRY TO HIDE THINGS
FROM ME.

15:59.529 --> 16:02.562
I'M A LITTLE TOO SHARP
FOR THAT.
 OKAY.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.473
SUSAN?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.705
HERE.

16:15.705 --> 16:18.208
HEY, I, UH, JUST GOT CALLED
ON A JOB.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.180
IT'S JUST
A BUSTED WATER MAIN,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.752
SO I SHOULD BE BACK BY--
WHOA.

16:22.752 --> 16:24.484
(sighs)

16:24.484 --> 16:26.656
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

16:26.656 --> 16:29.159
I CAME ACROSS JULIE'S JOURNAL.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.290
OKAY.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.292
SHE NEVER SAYS HIS NAME.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.294
WHOSE NAME?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.596
THE MARRIED MAN
SHE'S BEEN SEEING.

16:36.596 --> 16:41.101
SHE DOESN'T USE HIS NAME.
SHE JUST USES THE INITIAL--"D."

16:41.101 --> 16:43.573
WHY WOULD SHE USE A CODE
IN HER OWN JOURNAL?

16:43.573 --> 16:46.336
OH, BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID
HER MOM MIGHT COME ACROSS IT?

16:46.336 --> 16:49.639
OKAY, I KNOW THAT I AM
INVADING HER PRIVACY.

16:49.639 --> 16:52.642
(closes journal)
 I MEAN, SCREW IT.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

16:52.642 --> 16:57.247
I BET THIS D. IS
THE SICK BASTARD WHO...

16:59.018 --> 17:00.690
(whispers) HEY.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.222
SHH.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.223
(sighs)

17:04.223 --> 17:06.556
AND YOU KNOW
THE WORST PART?

17:06.556 --> 17:09.559
I READ THIS AND...

17:09.559 --> 17:14.263
IT'S LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN
BY A STRANGER.

17:14.263 --> 17:17.267
I MEAN, WHO IS THIS GIRL?

17:17.267 --> 17:21.141
SHE DROPPED OUT
OF MED SCHOOL,

17:21.141 --> 17:23.542
SHE LEAVES HER FULL SCHOLARSHIP
TO WAIT TABLES,

17:23.542 --> 17:25.545
AND THEN WHEN SHE CAME BACK,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.618
SHE STARTED AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED MAN.

17:28.618 --> 17:30.820
I DON'T KNOW THAT JULIE.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.522
(telephone rings)

17:32.522 --> 17:35.725
I MEAN, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH HER?
 (ring, beep)

17:35.725 --> 17:38.188
HELLO?

17:38.188 --> 17:39.529
REALLY?

17:39.529 --> 17:42.562
YOU CAN ASK HER YOURSELF.
SHE'S AWAKE.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.535
(sighs)

17:45.535 --> 17:48.238
(elevator bell dings,
telephone ringing)

17:48.238 --> 17:50.440
DR. HILL? HOW IS SHE?
CAN I SEE HER?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.442
YEAH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:52.442 --> 17:54.444
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING ATTACKED.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.446
SHE'S VERY TIRED
AND NEEDS HER REST,

17:56.446 --> 17:59.209
SO JUST SIT WITH HER, OKAY?
NO QUESTIONS.

17:59.209 --> 18:01.151
OF COURSE.

18:01.151 --> 18:04.614
I'LL JUST... (sighs) SIT.

18:06.716 --> 18:08.618
OH, JULIE.

18:08.618 --> 18:11.461
IT IS SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AWAKE.

18:11.461 --> 18:13.363
HEY, MOM.

18:13.363 --> 18:15.265
OH, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

18:15.265 --> 18:17.327
OH, WAIT. I FORGOT.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.199
DOCTOR SAID NO QUESTIONS.

18:19.199 --> 18:24.734
SO.. I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND... LOOK AT YOU.

18:24.734 --> 18:26.436
THANKS.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.107
I'M REALLY TIRED.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.240
OH.
WELL, YOU JUST SLEEP, BABY.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.349
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

18:39.349 --> 18:40.490
WHAT?

18:40.490 --> 18:43.493
WELL, LYNETTE SAID
YOU WERE SCARED YOU MIGHT BE.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.355
BUT YOU'RE NOT, SO...

18:45.355 --> 18:46.496
(sighs)
 YAY!

18:46.496 --> 18:48.598
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.

18:48.598 --> 18:50.760
OH. NOW I'VE UPSET YOU.
I'M SORRY.

18:50.760 --> 18:55.265
UH, JUST IGNORE ME
AND YOU SLEEP.

18:55.265 --> 18:57.767
(exhales deeply) OKAY.

19:04.774 --> 19:06.546
(whispers) IF YOU WANT,

19:06.546 --> 19:09.249
I COULD TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND
THAT YOU'RE BETTER.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.381
MY BOYFRIEND?

19:11.381 --> 19:14.384
(normal voice) WELL, I KNEW YOU
THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT,

19:14.384 --> 19:17.387
AND I DON'T SEE YOU GOING
THE TURKEY BASTER ROUTE,

19:17.387 --> 19:20.460
SO I JUST ASSUMED
THAT YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.932
I COULD CALL HIM FOR YOU.
 UGH, MOM.

19:22.932 --> 19:25.235
UNLESS YOU THINK
HE STRANGLED YOU

19:25.235 --> 19:28.498
BECAUSE HE'S MARRIED.
 I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.242
THEN WE WON'T.

19:32.242 --> 19:35.345
I'M NOT EVEN HERE.
YOU JUST REST.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.347
(scoffs) HOW CAN I REST

19:37.347 --> 19:39.879
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE
WITH ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

19:39.879 --> 19:42.312
HAVE I ASKED YOU
ONE SINGLE QUESTION?

19:42.312 --> 19:45.315
I MEAN, BESIDES THAT ONE?
 I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.317
JULIE, PLEASE.
I AM YOUR MOM.

19:47.317 --> 19:50.420
THERE IS NOT A THING
THAT YOU CAN'T TELL ME.

19:50.420 --> 19:54.564
I KNOW,
AND I'M TELLING YOU TO GO.

19:54.564 --> 19:55.895
OKAY.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.605
(sighs deeply)

20:05.605 --> 20:09.739
I MISS YOU, TOO.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.912
A PEACH NIGHTGOWN. WHY?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.885
KARL, WE ARE NOT DOING THIS
ON THE PHONE AGAIN!

20:15.885 --> 20:18.388
IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP,
TAKE A PILL.

20:18.388 --> 20:19.619
(beep)

20:19.619 --> 20:22.252
(sighs) MM.

20:24.294 --> 20:25.795
(sighs)

20:38.268 --> 20:40.710
(door closes)

20:42.612 --> 20:46.416
KATHERINE, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
WE, UH, REALLY NEED TO TALK.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.918
IF IT'S ABOUT ORDERING THE TENTS
FOR THE HENDERSON REUNION,

20:48.918 --> 20:50.420
ALREADY DONE.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.453
I SAW YOU AT MIKE AND SUSAN'S
LAST NIGHT.

20:53.453 --> 20:57.427
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME?

20:57.427 --> 20:59.559
I AM NOT THE SPY
IN THIS STORY.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.392
OKAY, YOU SAW ME.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.994
WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW?

21:04.994 --> 21:08.968
SUSAN WENT TO BED EARLY,
AND MIKE WATCHED A BALL GAME.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.970
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A MARRIAGE
TO YOU?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.872
THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE
A MARRIAGE.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.804
ALL I KNOW IS,

21:14.804 --> 21:18.047
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO WATCH
A BALL GAME WITH MIKE AGAIN.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.279
THROUGH A WINDOW!

21:20.279 --> 21:23.313
KATHERINE, YOU ARE LOSING
YOUR GRIP HERE.

21:23.313 --> 21:26.316
MIKE LOVES SUSAN.
HE IS NOT COMING BACK TO YOU.

21:26.316 --> 21:28.318
AND IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT,

21:28.318 --> 21:30.690
THEN YOU REALLY NEED
TO GET SOME HELP.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.393
(melon thuds)
 YOU JUST CANNOT STAND
TO SEE ME HAPPY, CAN YOU?

21:33.393 --> 21:36.826
OKAY, I REALIZE YOU'RE UPSET--
 BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT ONCE I GET MIKE BACK,

21:36.826 --> 21:39.829
I AM GONNA HAVE MORE IN MY LIFE
THAN JUST WORK.

21:39.829 --> 21:42.802
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO YOUR JOB FOR YOU.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.805
EXCUSE ME?
 YOU'RE NEVER HERE ANYMORE,
BREE.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.977
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO BUSY
THESE DAYS.

21:47.977 --> 21:49.979
BUT YOU'RE NEVER TOO BUSY

21:49.979 --> 21:52.982
TO TAKE BOWS
FOR THE FOOD THAT I COOKED,

21:52.982 --> 21:56.486
AND I AM TIRED
OF CARRYING YOU!
 OKAY, WELL, THAT'S GONNA STOP
RIGHT NOW

21:56.486 --> 21:58.788
BECAUSE I AM PUTTING YOU
ON SICK LEAVE FOR THREE WEEKS,

21:58.788 --> 22:01.421
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
 I'M NOT SICK.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.354
(whispers) YES, YOU ARE.

22:04.354 --> 22:05.825
(normal voice) NOW GO.

22:07.457 --> 22:10.430
(sets down apple)

22:12.331 --> 22:14.364
(telephone ringing)

22:14.364 --> 22:17.437
(exhales deeply) YOU'VE GOT
SOME ADMIRERS OUT THERE.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.438
OH?

22:18.438 --> 22:20.440
YEAH, AS YOU WALKED BY,

22:20.440 --> 22:23.443
I HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY, "CHECK
OUT THE RACK ON THAT ONE."

22:23.443 --> 22:26.416
AW. CAN I DO THE HONORS
AND CALL SECURITY?

22:26.416 --> 22:28.518
NO, AND HERE'S WHY.

22:28.518 --> 22:30.520
THEY'RE
THE BERTOLLINI BROTHERS.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.522
THEY'VE GOT
A $200 MILLION PENSION FUND

22:32.522 --> 22:34.824
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
TO RUN.

22:34.824 --> 22:37.627
WHY ARE YOU TELLING THIS
TO "THE RACK"?

22:37.627 --> 22:40.460
JUST LISTEN.
WE TAKE THEM TO DINNER,

22:40.460 --> 22:43.062
THEY ADMIRE THE GIRLS
 UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,

22:43.062 --> 22:45.465
THEN WE CLOSE THE DEAL.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.598
AND THEN THEY LEAVE THE MONEY
ON THE DRESSER, RIGHT?

22:48.598 --> 22:50.099
(chuckles)

22:50.099 --> 22:52.702
WHAT, YOU'RE MAD?
 YEAH., OF COURSE I'M MAD.

22:52.702 --> 22:54.704
YOU CAN'T USE MY BREASTS
AS BAIT.

22:54.704 --> 22:57.447
WHERE DO YOU GET
THIS ATTITUDE?

22:57.447 --> 22:59.449
COME ON. YOU DON'T BUY
CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS

22:59.449 --> 23:02.482
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
HANG 'EM ON A TREE.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.953
OKAY, BAD METAPHOR.

23:03.953 --> 23:06.456
MY POINT IS,
WHY WOULD YOU GET THOSE THINGS

23:06.456 --> 23:08.958
IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
LOOKING AT THEM?

23:08.958 --> 23:11.791
I GUESS...

23:11.791 --> 23:13.423
I...

23:13.423 --> 23:16.626
I WOULDN'T HAVE.

23:16.626 --> 23:19.028
OKAY.

23:19.028 --> 23:21.130
(sighs)

23:21.130 --> 23:24.133
WHEN DO WE DO THIS?
 TONIGHT.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.135
AND IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

23:26.135 --> 23:28.738
BUY YOURSELF A NEW DRESS...

23:28.738 --> 23:30.440
ON THE COMPANY.
 (card hits desk)

23:33.142 --> 23:37.817
A MAN JUST GAVE ME A CREDIT CARD
BECAUSE OF MY BOOBS.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.551
THAT MAKES ME FEEL
LESS LIKE A HOOKER.

23:41.551 --> 23:44.193
(dishes clattering in distance)

23:44.193 --> 23:45.555
JOHN.

23:45.555 --> 23:48.628
HEY, GABY. WHAT'S UP?

23:48.628 --> 23:51.200
IF MY NIECE HAS HER WAY,
HER SKIRT.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.964
EXCUSE ME?
 YOU PULLED OUT
THE OLD JOHN ROWLAND CHARM,

23:54.964 --> 23:57.136
AND NOW
ANA HAS FALLEN FOR YOU.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.810
SO SHE HAS A LITTLE CRUSH.
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

24:00.810 --> 24:02.472
NO, NO, NO.

24:02.472 --> 24:04.974
"SWEET" WOULD BE DOODLING
YOUR NAME IN HER NOTEBOOK.

24:04.974 --> 24:08.177
ANA BOUGHT CONDOMS
IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A VALU-PACK.

24:08.177 --> 24:11.220
WOW. I HAD NO IDEA
SHE WAS THAT SERIOUS.

24:11.220 --> 24:14.183
I MEAN, I WAS ONLY FLIRTING
WITH HER... A LITTLE.

24:14.183 --> 24:16.756
WELL, SHE'S 17,

24:16.756 --> 24:19.188
SO YOU'RE ALSO FLIRTING
WITH AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

24:19.188 --> 24:21.831
YOU'RE PRETTY WORKED UP
ABOUT THIS.

24:21.831 --> 24:24.794
YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.
IF YOU LAY ONE FINGER ON ANA,

24:24.794 --> 24:27.136
CARLOS WILL KNOCK EVERY TOOTH
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,

24:27.136 --> 24:29.198
WHICH WILL MAKE YOU
PRETTY DARN POPULAR IN PRISON.

24:29.198 --> 24:31.200
LOOK,
I'M NOT REALLY INTO ANA.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.575
OKAY, I WAS FLIRTING WITH HER
TO SEE IF YOU STILL CARED.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.607
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU DO.

24:37.607 --> 24:39.178
NO, I DON'T.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.750
REALLY?

24:40.750 --> 24:42.752
UH, IF YOU WEREN'T JEALOUS,

24:42.752 --> 24:45.254
THEN WHY'D YOU FORBID ME
TO DRIVE ANA HOME?

24:45.254 --> 24:47.486
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
WHAT YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
IN A PARKED CAR.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.991
LOOK, I THINK ABOUT THOSE DAYS
A LOT, GABY.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.564
I MEAN, I WAS JUST A KID.

24:54.564 --> 24:56.626
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO MOW LAWNS
FOR A LIVING,

24:56.626 --> 24:59.128
AND I COULDN'T OFFER YOU
ANYTHING BUT--BUT SEX.

24:59.128 --> 25:02.832
BUT NOW I CAN OFFER YOU
SO MUCH MORE.
 W-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:02.832 --> 25:04.834
I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY NOW,
GABY.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.836
YOU KNOW, AND--AND YOU'RE
STUCK IN A HOUSE

25:06.836 --> 25:08.838
WITH TWO KIDS AND A HUSBAND
WHO'S NEVER HOME.

25:08.838 --> 25:10.840
AND WHEN I SAW YOU AGAIN,

25:10.840 --> 25:13.042
WITH MACARONI AND CHEESE
ON YOUR T-SHIRT,

25:13.042 --> 25:15.615
I SAID TO MYSELF,
"WHAT A SHAME.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.617
"YOU KNOW,
THIS GORGEOUS WOMAN

25:17.617 --> 25:20.119
SHOULD BE SIPPING CHAMPAGNE
ON A YACHT."

25:20.119 --> 25:23.122
SO... WHAT,
YOU'RE GONNA RESCUE ME?

25:23.122 --> 25:26.295
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT UNHAPPY.
 I'M NOT.

25:26.295 --> 25:29.829
WHY DON'T I BELIEVE YOU?

25:34.704 --> 25:36.165
(gasps)

25:38.067 --> 25:41.140
ANA, WAIT!

25:52.551 --> 25:54.553
(brakes squeal,
engine turns off)

26:01.190 --> 26:02.191
CARLOS?

26:02.191 --> 26:03.963
HE ISN'T HOME YET.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.264
(keys clatter)

26:05.264 --> 26:07.296
ANA, WE HAVE TO TALK.

26:07.296 --> 26:10.700
YOU KNEW THAT I LIKED HIM.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

26:10.700 --> 26:14.073
OKAY, WHAT YOU SAW WASN'T
WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.745
OH, DID YOU SLIP,

26:15.745 --> 26:18.247
AND YOUR TONGUE ACCIDENTALLY
FELL INTO JOHN'S MOUTH?

26:18.247 --> 26:20.249
I DIDN'T KISS JOHN!
JOHN KISSED ME!

26:20.249 --> 26:22.612
AND NO TONGUES
WERE INVOLVED!

26:22.612 --> 26:25.114
YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE
YOUR VERSION. I HAVE MINE.

26:25.114 --> 26:27.617
WE'LL SEE WHICH ONE
UNCLE CARLOS BELIEVES.

26:27.617 --> 26:30.990
OKAY, ANA, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.992
(sighs)

26:32.992 --> 26:34.924
TEN YEARS AGO,

26:34.924 --> 26:37.967
JOHN ROWLAND AND I...

26:37.967 --> 26:39.629
HAD AN AFFAIR.

26:39.629 --> 26:42.601
YOUR UNCLE CARLOS
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.334
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT HURT.

26:45.334 --> 26:47.336
BUT WE SURVIVED IT.

26:48.838 --> 26:51.941
I HAVE NO MORE FEELINGS
FOR JOHN.

26:51.941 --> 26:55.084
BUT TODAY I FOUND OUT
HE STILL HAS FEELINGS FOR ME.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.191
I SAW YOU STARING AT THIS
THE OTHER DAY.

27:02.191 --> 27:05.154
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN.

27:05.154 --> 27:07.897
NOW I DO.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.233
ANA...

27:17.136 --> 27:20.840
I WAS STARING AT A MEMORY.
YES.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.342
AND SOMETIMES WHEN I'M HAVING
A ROUGH DAY,

27:23.342 --> 27:25.845
I THINK ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.319
BUT TRUST ME,
I WOULD NEVER GO BACK.

27:35.685 --> 27:39.428
(car door shuts)
 LOOK, ANA,
I LOVE YOUR UNCLE CARLOS,

27:39.428 --> 27:41.731
AND WE HAVE
A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER.

27:41.731 --> 27:44.734
PLEASE, DO NOT DO ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA HURT HIM.

27:44.734 --> 27:47.296
(door unlocks)

27:49.438 --> 27:51.170
HEY, GUYS.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.342
(Carlos)
FINALLY GOT HOME EARLY.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.075
HI. OHH.

27:56.075 --> 27:59.148
MMM. (chuckles)
SO WHAT'S NEW?

27:59.148 --> 28:02.752
I WAS JUST
TELLING AUNT GABY...

28:05.254 --> 28:08.017
THAT I WANNA QUIT MY JOB.

28:14.023 --> 28:17.296
ANYWAY, I HAVE HOMEWORK.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.270
(door opens)
 MOM?

28:21.270 --> 28:23.973
I FOUND THIS ON MY BED.

28:23.973 --> 28:27.737
YOU LIKE IT?
 YEAH. WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

28:27.737 --> 28:30.139
THE PARTY.
I WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD.

28:30.139 --> 28:33.282
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

28:33.282 --> 28:36.986
WHY NOT? I WANTED TO BUY
SOMETHING NICE FOR MY SON.

28:36.986 --> 28:39.148
BESIDES,
IT MADE ME FEEL LESS GUILTY

28:39.148 --> 28:41.150
ABOUT BUYING THIS FOR ME.

28:41.150 --> 28:42.451
(chuckles)
 CUTE, HUH?

28:42.451 --> 28:43.823
YEAH.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.096
WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT ON ME.

28:47.096 --> 28:49.799
(zip)

28:56.135 --> 28:59.368
ARE YOU EVER GONNA
GET THAT THING TAKEN CARE OF?

28:59.368 --> 29:01.410
WHAT, THE SCAR?

29:01.410 --> 29:05.144
MNH. I DON'T EVEN SEE IT
ANYMORE.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.147
THEY CAN GET RID OF THOSE THINGS
THESE DAYS, MOM.

29:08.147 --> 29:11.180
YEAH, BUT THAT COSTS MONEY.
 SO?

29:11.180 --> 29:13.522
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT MONEY. YOU KNOW THAT.

29:13.522 --> 29:15.524
I DON'T SEE DAD
BEING CAREFUL.

29:15.524 --> 29:18.257
HE BOUGHT A NEW SET
OF GOLF CLUBS.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.160
DANNY, LISTEN TO ME.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.893
AFTER THE EXPLOSION,
I WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

29:23.893 --> 29:27.066
YOU FATHER TOOK
REAL GOOD CARE OF ME.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.938
HE HUNG IN THERE.

29:28.938 --> 29:32.041
HE'S A GOOD MAN.
DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.479
ONE DAY, I'M GONNA MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY,

29:40.479 --> 29:43.913
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET THAT SCAR FIXED.

29:43.913 --> 29:46.555
OH, HONEY.

29:46.555 --> 29:48.417
AND DON'T WORRY.

29:48.417 --> 29:51.260
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.035
HI.

30:06.035 --> 30:08.037
WHOA. CHECK OUT THE DRESS.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

30:08.037 --> 30:10.409
(chuckles)
 WHAT'D IT COST?

30:10.409 --> 30:11.911
MY DIGNITY.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.382
WORTH EVERY PENNY.

30:13.382 --> 30:15.484
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO CHECK YOUR JACKET?

30:15.484 --> 30:18.117
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY
IN HERE.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.489
LYNETTE, IT'S NOT CHILLY.

30:20.489 --> 30:23.923
AND EVEN IF IT WAS, THAT'S MORE
OF A REASON TO LOSE THE JACKET.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.524
HMM?

30:25.524 --> 30:27.957
COME ON.
IT'S JUST FOR ONE NIGHT.

30:27.957 --> 30:29.999
FINE.

30:32.201 --> 30:35.434
I WILL CHECK THIS FOR YOU.
GO MEET THE GUYS.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.174
(chuckles)

30:45.174 --> 30:48.177
(rock music playing)

30:48.177 --> 30:51.380
(speaking inaudibly)

30:55.454 --> 30:58.427
AND THERE HE IS NOW.

30:58.427 --> 31:00.930
HEY, I WAS JUST TELLING
THESE GUYS ABOUT--

31:00.930 --> 31:03.032
HEY, COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC, DAD?

31:03.032 --> 31:05.965
YEAH. SURE. EXCUSE ME
ONE SECOND, LADIES, HUH?

31:08.497 --> 31:10.199
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:10.199 --> 31:12.571
WHAT,
I CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.573
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HERE,

31:14.573 --> 31:17.146
BUT YOU PICK
A COUPLE 20-YEAR-OLD GIRLS?

31:17.146 --> 31:20.279
DANNY, COME ON. I'M SAYING HELLO
TO A COUPLE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.481
YEAH, WELL, DON'T.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.484
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN GETTIN' THIS
VIBE FROM YOU FOR A WHILE NOW,

31:25.484 --> 31:29.088
AND I DON'T THINK
I DESERVE IT.
 OH, I THINK YOU DO.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.460
YOU DO? WHY IS THAT?

31:31.460 --> 31:35.464
BECAUSE I KNOW.

31:35.464 --> 31:38.327
YOU KNOW WHAT, SON?

31:43.432 --> 31:46.135
(Angie) JEEZ, NICK!
WHAT THE HELL?!

31:46.135 --> 31:49.038
WHAT DO YOU GOTTA CRASH
EVERY PARTY IN THE WORLD?

31:49.038 --> 31:51.310
I BET YOU WANT HIM
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.013
I'M ON IT. HAVE FUN, BABY.
COME ON.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.453
HI, SWEETHEART.

32:04.453 --> 32:05.494
(door closes)
 HEY!

32:05.494 --> 32:07.496
HOOKER'S HOME.
 (keys jangle)

32:07.496 --> 32:10.359
HOW DID IT GO?

32:10.359 --> 32:12.631
IT WAS BIZARRE.

32:12.631 --> 32:16.605
FROM THE MOMENT I WALKED IN
WITH THE GIRLS HERE,

32:16.605 --> 32:20.439
I GOT SMILES, WINKS.
MEN PULLED OUT MY CHAIR.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.013
THE BUSBOY FILLED MY WATER GLASS
EVERY TWO MINUTES.

32:24.013 --> 32:26.015
AND THE BERTOLLINI BROTHERS,

32:26.015 --> 32:29.018
WHO SEEM TO THINK OUR PROPOSAL
WAS WRITTEN ON MY CLEAVAGE,

32:29.018 --> 32:31.020
WERE PUTTY IN MY HANDS.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.422
THEY SIGNED THE DEAL
ON THE SPOT!
 THAT'S GREAT!

32:33.422 --> 32:35.354
CONGRATULATIONS.
 YEAH.

32:38.027 --> 32:41.230
SO WHY ARE MEN SO OBSESSED
WITH THESE THINGS?

32:41.230 --> 32:43.692
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, HONEY.

32:43.692 --> 32:47.436
I MEAN, SOME GUYS, UH,
ARE JUST BREAST MEN.

32:47.436 --> 32:48.967
"SOME GUYS," HUH?

32:48.967 --> 32:52.741
ME? I APPRECIATE ALL ASPECTS
OF THE FEMALE--

32:52.741 --> 32:54.743
I'M UP HERE, TOM.
(clicks tongue) COME ON.

32:54.743 --> 32:57.576
COME ON, I'VE SEEN PICTURES
OF YOUR OLD GIRLFRIENDS.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.578
JUST ADMIT IT.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.451
OKAY. MY NAME IT TOM SCAVO,
AND I LIKE BIG BREASTS.

33:02.451 --> 33:04.653
BUT YOU MARRIED ME.

33:04.653 --> 33:08.517
MAN, I STEPPED RIGHT
INTO THAT ONE, DIDN'T I?

33:08.517 --> 33:12.161
SO LET ME ASK YOU. YOU EVER
FEEL LIKE YOU COMPROMISED?

33:12.161 --> 33:15.024
YEAH. (scoffs)

33:15.024 --> 33:18.627
OKAY, I'M GIVING YOU
ONE CHANCE TO START OVER.

33:18.627 --> 33:20.629
NO, NO, NO, NO. I...

33:20.629 --> 33:23.402
I NEED YOU
TO NOT BE PERFECT.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.274
WHY?

33:25.274 --> 33:28.577
BECAUSE I'M NOT PERFECT.

33:28.577 --> 33:33.382
I'M NOT... RICH.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.284
I'M NOT BRILLIANT.

33:35.284 --> 33:38.016
I'M NOT MOVIE STAR HANDSOME.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.490
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THIS ONE FLAW,

33:41.490 --> 33:44.493
I WOULD SPEND EVERY MOMENT
OF EVERY DAY WONDERING,

33:44.493 --> 33:46.795
WHAT THE HECK
IS SHE DOING WITH ME?

33:50.299 --> 33:52.531
YOU MAY NOT BE BRILLIANT,

33:52.531 --> 33:55.234
BUT YOU CAN TIPTOE
THROUGH A MINEFIELD

33:55.234 --> 33:58.167
BETTER THAN ANYONE I KNOW.

33:58.167 --> 34:01.070
WELL DONE.

34:01.070 --> 34:02.471
MWAH.

34:02.471 --> 34:03.542
MMM.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.514
(sighs) HI.

34:05.514 --> 34:07.246
HI.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.248
I TRIED TO WAIT UP,
BUT TODAY WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.181
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:12.181 --> 34:14.183
WELL, THE REPAIRMAN
FINALLY SHOWED UP,

34:14.183 --> 34:17.126
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE
THE RIGHT PART SO HE LEFT AGAIN.

34:17.126 --> 34:19.128
THEN CELIA HID MY CAR KEYS

34:19.128 --> 34:22.130
SO I COULDN'T TAKE HER
TO THE DENTIST.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.132
THEN SHE FORGOT
WHERE SHE PUT THEM.

34:24.132 --> 34:26.135
(sighs) I TOLD THEM BOTH

34:26.135 --> 34:28.137
THEY'D BE SORRY
WHEN THEIR FATHER GOT HOME,

34:28.137 --> 34:30.139
EXCEPT YOU DIDN'T...
UNTIL NOW.

34:30.139 --> 34:33.272
I'M SORRY, GABY.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.743
IT'S OKAY.

34:34.743 --> 34:38.476
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.409
WHAT?

34:40.409 --> 34:42.281
(sighs)

34:42.281 --> 34:45.454
MY LIFE.

34:45.454 --> 34:47.716
IT JUST SEEMS SO SMALL
SOMETIMES.

34:50.559 --> 34:52.561
(Gabrielle) I SPEND MY DAYS

34:52.561 --> 34:57.126
THINKING ABOUT DETERGENT
AND GROCERIES...

34:57.126 --> 35:01.230
OR HOW I'M GONNA GET THE SPOT
OUT OF THE UPHOLSTERY.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.232
IT'S NOT AT ALL

35:03.232 --> 35:06.135
THE LIFE I THOUGHT
I'D CHOOSE FOR MYSELF.

35:06.135 --> 35:08.377
BUT SOME DAYS,

35:08.377 --> 35:12.211
I LOOK UP,

35:12.211 --> 35:15.144
AND I REALIZE I'M HAPPY.

35:18.347 --> 35:20.889
I'M HONEST TO GOD
HAPPY WITH MY LIFE.

35:23.652 --> 35:26.755
ANYWAY, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.348
CAN I HELP YOU WITH THAT?

35:49.348 --> 35:50.519
KATHERINE.

35:50.519 --> 35:52.521
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON SICK LEAVE.

35:52.521 --> 35:54.423
I'M BETTER. REALLY.

35:54.423 --> 35:56.425
NOW WHAT CAN I DO?

35:56.425 --> 35:58.827
(clears throat)
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.

35:58.827 --> 36:00.889
(sighs)

36:00.889 --> 36:02.561
(sighs) NEITHER DO I.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.563
I'VE LOST SO MUCH
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.266
MY JOB AND YOUR FRIENDSHIP--
IT'S...

36:07.266 --> 36:09.838
IT'S ALL I HAVE LEFT,
AND I CAN'T LOSE THOSE.

36:09.838 --> 36:11.500
OH, HONEY.

36:14.573 --> 36:18.507
SO...
ARE WE FRIENDS AGAIN?

36:18.507 --> 36:19.848
OF COURSE.

36:19.848 --> 36:22.411
I'VE JUST BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, THAT'S ALL.

36:22.411 --> 36:26.285
BUT IF YOU SAY YOU'RE BETTER,
THEN.... (sighs) I BELIEVE YOU.

36:26.285 --> 36:30.219
GOOD,
BECAUSE I REALLY, REALLY AM.

36:30.219 --> 36:32.321
(chuckles)

36:32.321 --> 36:35.224
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

36:35.224 --> 36:36.725
OH, THAT'S THE CAKE.

36:36.725 --> 36:38.897
NO, THAT'S MY CAKE.

36:38.897 --> 36:42.271
YES. THE BRIDE SAW YOUR DESIGN
AND JUST LOVED IT.

36:42.271 --> 36:44.503
NO, IT'S MY CAKE--

36:44.503 --> 36:46.435
THE ONE I DESIGNED
FOR MY WEDDING--

36:46.435 --> 36:47.936
MINE AND MIKE'S.

36:47.936 --> 36:49.538
OH.

36:49.538 --> 36:52.541
WELL, AREN'T YOU GLAD
WE FOUND A GOOD USE FOR IT?

36:52.541 --> 36:56.545
I WATCHED ANOTHER BRIDE
MARRY MY FIANCé.

36:56.545 --> 36:59.688
I AM NOT GOING TO WATCH
ANOTHER BRIDE EAT MY CAKE.

36:59.688 --> 37:03.492
WELL, NO ONE SAYS
YOU HAVE TO WATCH, DEAR.

37:03.492 --> 37:05.494
(gasps) KATHERINE,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

37:05.494 --> 37:07.626
BUT DON'T YOU DARE
TAKE IT OUT ON THAT CAKE!

37:07.626 --> 37:11.530
IT'S MINE. AND IF I CAN'T
HAVE IT, NOBODY WILL.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.802
KATHERINE, DON'T YOU TOUCH
THAT CAKE!
 AAH!

37:13.802 --> 37:15.704
LET GO!

37:15.704 --> 37:17.466
AAH! HELP!

37:17.466 --> 37:19.438
SOMEBODY HELP!

37:19.438 --> 37:20.639
OH!

37:20.639 --> 37:23.872
STOP THAT WOMAN!

37:23.872 --> 37:26.445
IT'S MINE!

37:26.445 --> 37:29.518
,,,TO BE MY LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE
AND ONE TRUE LOVE.

37:29.518 --> 37:33.382
I PROMISE TO CHERISH, HONOR
AND PROTECT YOU,

37:33.382 --> 37:36.555
AND TO LOVE YOU MORE EACH DAY
THAN I DID THE DAY BEFORE.

37:36.555 --> 37:39.328
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

37:39.328 --> 37:41.330
(Bree) KATHERINE, NO!
 (crash)

37:41.330 --> 37:43.632
HI.

37:43.632 --> 37:44.963
HEY.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.967
GOOD TO SEE YOU
OUT OF BED.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.999
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

37:50.999 --> 37:55.874
SO... HAVE YOU REMEMBERED
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE ATTACK?

37:55.874 --> 37:57.706
NOTHING.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.481
UH, JULIE,

38:02.481 --> 38:05.484
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WANTS
TO SEE THE GUY WHO DID THIS

38:05.484 --> 38:08.487
OFF THE STREETS, BUT THE POLICE
DON'T HAVE MUCH TO GO ON.

38:08.487 --> 38:12.821
SO... IF THEY COULD TALK
TO THIS...

38:12.821 --> 38:15.063
MAN THAT YOU WERE SEEING--
 MOM.

38:15.063 --> 38:18.697
MAYBE THEY COULD
CROSS HIM OFF THE LIST.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.029
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

38:21.029 --> 38:23.772
AND I'M NOT SEEING HIM ANYMORE,
OKAY?

38:23.772 --> 38:25.634
I BROKE IT OFF.

38:25.634 --> 38:27.906
YOU BROKE IT OFF?

38:27.906 --> 38:29.778
WELL, THAT'S A MOTIVE
RIGHT THERE.

38:29.778 --> 38:33.482
AT LEAST LET THEM
QUESTION HIM.

38:33.482 --> 38:35.514
IF HE'S INNOCENT,
HE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.646
EXCEPT FOR HIS FAMILY
WHEN THEY FIND OUT.

38:39.448 --> 38:42.921
(scoffs) SO NOW YOU'RE
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.424
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 YOU HEARD ME, JULIE.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.427
FOR GOD SAKE, WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING, DATING A MARRIED MAN?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.001
(sighs)

38:55.103 --> 38:58.507
DON'T DO THIS.

38:58.507 --> 39:01.069
I AM YOUR MOTHER.
I LOVE YOU.

39:01.069 --> 39:04.443
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST FIVE DAYS
SITTING THERE,

39:04.443 --> 39:08.647
NOT SLEEPING, NOT EATING.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.978
DON'T SHUT ME OUT.

39:15.023 --> 39:19.127
I WAS LONELY. OKAY?

39:19.127 --> 39:20.789
HE WAS NICE.

39:22.691 --> 39:24.833
IT--IT JUST HAPPENED.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.567
I DON'T SEE HOW.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.069
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU WOULD DO.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.674
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.876
I'M NOT PERFECT ANYMORE.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.480
THAT PERFECT DAUGHTER
YOU REMEMBER

39:41.480 --> 39:44.713
WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE
WHEN YOU NEEDED HER,

39:44.713 --> 39:46.555
WHO HELD EVERYTHING TOGETHER
WHEN YOU WERE FALLING APART?

39:46.555 --> 39:50.789
SHE'S GROWN UP, AND SHE'S GOING
TO MAKE MISTAKES.

39:50.789 --> 39:54.162
YOU WANNA MAKE MISTAKES?
FINE.

39:54.162 --> 39:56.595
DYE YOUR HAIR, DROP OUT
OF SCHOOL. I DON'T CARE.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.768
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO BE PERFECT,

39:59.768 --> 40:02.771
BUT I DIDN'T RAISE YOU
TO DO SOMETHING THIS STUPID.

40:05.073 --> 40:09.007
YOU KNOW WHAT
AN AFFAIR LIKE THIS CAN DO.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.109
YOU SAW IT FIRSTHAND.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.185
(sighs)

40:19.718 --> 40:21.990
MORNING.
 KATHERINE?

40:21.990 --> 40:24.052
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

40:24.052 --> 40:25.724
TO THE TEST KITCHEN.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.856
WE NEED TO START PREP
ON THE BERMAN BAR MITZVAH.

40:27.856 --> 40:31.630
YESTERDAY, YOU NEARLY DESTROYED
MY COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.132
TODAY YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT PREP WORK?

40:34.132 --> 40:36.134
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.136
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.168
THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED.

40:40.168 --> 40:42.541
I'M SORRY,
BUT I SEE NO OTHER WAY

40:42.541 --> 40:44.673
TO GET YOU REALIZE
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

40:44.673 --> 40:47.676
YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE UP
THIS OBSESSION WITH MIKE

40:47.676 --> 40:49.818
BEFORE IT RUINS YOUR LIFE.

40:49.818 --> 40:53.582
I NEED TO WORK. IT'S ALL
THAT'S KEEPING ME GOING.

40:53.582 --> 40:56.525
YOU NEED HELP, COUNSELING.

40:56.525 --> 40:58.687
I'M TELLING YOU THIS
AS YOUR FRIEND.

40:58.687 --> 40:59.988
(gasps)

40:59.988 --> 41:02.731
YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND.

41:02.731 --> 41:04.933
YES, I AM.

41:04.933 --> 41:08.166
THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING
SUCH A FIRM HAND.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.669
YOUR ONLY JOB NOW
IS TO GET BETTER.

41:12.801 --> 41:14.643
KATHERINE...

41:14.643 --> 41:17.145
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.

41:20.008 --> 41:21.510
(scoffs)

41:28.086 --> 41:30.989
(scraping)

41:30.989 --> 41:32.761
THERE YA GO.

41:32.761 --> 41:36.024
A SOUVENIR OF OUR...
 FRIENDSHIP.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.800
(Mary Alice) YOU WOULDN'T
THINK OF IT TO LOOK AT HER,

41:41.800 --> 41:46.104
BUT THE LADY NEXT DOOR
IS HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

41:46.104 --> 41:50.208
YOU'D NEVER GUESS BY HER SMILE,

41:50.208 --> 41:54.613
BUT THE WIFE OF YOUR UNCLE
ONCE BETRAYED HIS TRUST.

41:57.045 --> 41:59.848
AND THAT DAUGHTER YOU ADORE...

41:59.848 --> 42:05.093
WELL, SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED MAN.

42:10.198 --> 42:11.700
THE SAD TRUTH IS,

42:11.700 --> 42:14.202
WE DON'T KNOW OUR FRIENDS
AND NEIGHBORS

42:14.202 --> 42:17.636
NEARLY AS WELL
AS WE THINK WE DO.

42:19.568 --> 42:22.641
EVEN THE PEOPLE
WE TRUST MOST...

42:22.641 --> 42:24.643
KEEP SECRETS.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.174
HEY, JULIE.

42:26.174 --> 42:28.016
IT'S DOMINIC.

42:29.718 --> 42:31.549
I MISS YOU.
