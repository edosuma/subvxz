00:02.462 --> 00:06.433
Andy got back from London two days ago
and he still has jet lag.

00:06.553 --> 00:07.820
It's really annoying.

00:07.854 --> 00:09.411
We're on totally different
schedules.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.091
Last night he mowed the lawn
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:12.211 --> 00:14.777
Andy!
Andy!

00:14.828 --> 00:16.879
- Get me a beer?
- All right.

00:16.913 --> 00:17.863
As soon as I wake up,

00:17.898 --> 00:19.896
he goes down.
Hard.

00:20.206 --> 00:21.867
This has to stop!

00:21.901 --> 00:23.869
- [Snores]
- Babe, wake up.

00:23.887 --> 00:26.689
That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca.

00:26.723 --> 00:27.656
Babe!

00:27.691 --> 00:29.546
[Clanging]

00:29.783 --> 00:32.301
You hungry, Champion?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.636
[Gasps] Oh, my God.

00:33.670 --> 00:35.104
Are you kidding me?

00:39.343 --> 00:41.944
Hey. Oh, man,
I fell asleep again.

00:41.979 --> 00:43.613
Andy, you have got to stay up

00:43.664 --> 00:45.047
and get on a regular schedule.

00:45.082 --> 00:48.351
Were you about to spray me
with the hose inside the house?

00:48.402 --> 00:51.170
- Yeah.
- I kinda want you to do it now.

00:51.204 --> 00:53.256
- Okay.
- Aah! Aah!

00:53.307 --> 00:54.724
- Aaahhh!
- [Shouting]

00:54.758 --> 00:57.693
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:57.744 --> 00:59.629
[Screaming]

01:01.598 --> 01:04.500

01:21.512 --> 01:24.136
Okay, just a reminder, guys,
today is Leslie's last day

01:24.154 --> 01:25.655
as a city councilor,

01:25.706 --> 01:27.757
so everyone be extra supportive.

01:27.791 --> 01:28.758
Already done.

01:28.809 --> 01:30.593
When she walked past me
this morning,

01:30.644 --> 01:33.145
I gave her a kind nod.

01:33.163 --> 01:34.547
Heartwarming.

01:34.581 --> 01:36.182
Also I want to get her
a present to cheer her up

01:36.216 --> 01:37.316
on her last day.

01:37.351 --> 01:38.818
Any ideas?

01:38.852 --> 01:40.569
A "sorry you lost
your dream job" gift?

01:40.621 --> 01:42.555
Mm, that's a tough one.
Stay away from wine.

01:42.589 --> 01:43.823
Wine is crying juice.

01:43.857 --> 01:45.441
Well, I mean, you know her
better than anybody.

01:45.492 --> 01:48.210
What does she really want?
More than anything in the world?

01:48.261 --> 01:50.913
A nice candle.
I'm screwed.

01:50.947 --> 01:53.098
- [Gasps]
- No! Andy!

01:53.116 --> 01:54.867
- An-Andy!
- Oh! Come on!

01:54.901 --> 01:57.303
- Andy!
- Be right out.

01:57.337 --> 02:00.339
Well, this is the
Pawnee City Council chambers.

02:00.357 --> 02:02.425
Your new home away from me.

02:02.459 --> 02:04.427
Well, technically, my home
away from home is in Zurich.

02:04.461 --> 02:07.530
Frank Gehry designed it.
But this is nice too.

02:07.564 --> 02:08.614
Today is my last day

02:08.649 --> 02:10.616
[hoarsely]
As a--excuse me.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.385
[Clears throat]
Let me try this again.

02:12.419 --> 02:13.869
Today is [Hoarsely]
my last day at C--

02:13.904 --> 02:15.688
[full voice]
Today is my la--

02:15.722 --> 02:16.789
[high pitched]
Today is my last d--

02:16.823 --> 02:18.107
You know what?
You get the idea.

02:18.141 --> 02:20.142
My old friend Ingrid de Forest
won the recall vote,

02:20.193 --> 02:22.211
and she's taking my place
on Monday morning.

02:22.245 --> 02:23.579
But, you know, luckily for me,

02:23.630 --> 02:24.880
I've processed all my feelings.

02:24.931 --> 02:27.350
And I've gone through
the five stages of grief:

02:27.401 --> 02:29.368
Denial, anger,
Internet commenting,

02:29.403 --> 02:30.803
cat adoption, African dance,

02:30.837 --> 02:33.055
cat returning
to the adoption place,

02:33.106 --> 02:34.707
watching all the episodes
of <i>Murphy Brown,</i>

02:34.741 --> 02:36.359
and not giving a flying fart.

02:36.393 --> 02:38.461
How many stages is that?

02:38.512 --> 02:39.462
I don't know.

02:39.496 --> 02:41.197
The point is I'm fine now.

02:41.231 --> 02:43.199
This must be hard for you.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.518
It's like what
sir Ian McKellen said to me

02:45.552 --> 02:47.470
the day I sold my boat
to Karl Lagerfeld:

02:47.521 --> 02:49.905
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

02:49.956 --> 02:52.208
Oh, my God.
What is your life?

02:52.259 --> 02:53.419
If it makes any difference,

02:53.427 --> 02:55.461
your work here
was a real inspiration to me,

02:55.495 --> 02:58.881
and I am going to do my best
to continue your legacy.

02:58.932 --> 03:02.068
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment.

03:02.102 --> 03:05.237
[Exhales]

03:05.255 --> 03:06.889
- Leslie.
- [Gasps]

03:06.923 --> 03:08.574
I'm sorry.
Was I singing

03:08.608 --> 03:10.476
<i>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</i>
out loud?

03:10.510 --> 03:12.745
No. But would you like to?

03:12.779 --> 03:14.113
I studied opera at the Sorbonne.

03:14.147 --> 03:15.464
I'd be happy to harmonize.

03:15.515 --> 03:17.266
[Sings] Goodbye...

03:17.317 --> 03:18.984
[Sings operatically]
Goodbye...

03:19.018 --> 03:20.369
Naw.

03:20.404 --> 03:21.954
And finally,

03:21.988 --> 03:23.839
here is a check
for the entirety

03:23.890 --> 03:25.241
of the purchase
of Rent-A-Swag.

03:25.275 --> 03:27.392
And here is a personal note

03:27.411 --> 03:29.495
from my client
Dr. Saperstein.

03:29.529 --> 03:30.713
"Dear Tom:
I win.

03:30.747 --> 03:32.415
"You suck.
Turn note over.

03:32.466 --> 03:33.465
"You still suck.

03:33.483 --> 03:35.284
Turn note over."

03:35.318 --> 03:37.369
Okay, Saperstein
couldn't even face me himself?

03:37.403 --> 03:38.504
He had to send in his lackey?

03:38.538 --> 03:39.505
My client isn't at this meeting

03:39.539 --> 03:40.923
because he doesn't have to be.

03:40.974 --> 03:42.174
Successful people,
Mr. Haverford,

03:42.209 --> 03:44.810
use their money to use others
to work for them.

03:44.828 --> 03:46.829
Hmm, it's an interesting idea,
lawyer-dude.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.731
What if I gave you 5 bucks
to put a bag of poop

03:48.765 --> 03:49.765
in Saperstein's car?

03:49.816 --> 03:51.033
No.
[Locks click]

03:51.067 --> 03:53.753
Ballpark me.
How much would it cost?

03:53.787 --> 03:54.754
$10,000.

03:54.788 --> 03:56.422
Counter-offer:

03:56.456 --> 03:57.807
Why don't you just do it
for the story?

03:57.841 --> 04:00.392
Goodbye, Mr. Haverford.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.877
Is it done?

04:01.912 --> 04:05.231
Well, how many times
did he turn the paper over?

04:05.265 --> 04:08.701
Oh, that is disappointing.

04:08.735 --> 04:09.610
So...

04:09.730 --> 04:10.520
look at this baby.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.671
That is
the most symmetrical fetus

04:12.705 --> 04:13.689
I've ever seen.

04:13.723 --> 04:15.808
This could be a superhero.

04:15.826 --> 04:17.243
- Dr. Saperstein.
- Yes.

04:17.277 --> 04:18.711
I know that we should hate you

04:18.745 --> 04:20.329
because you destroyed
our friend's business.

04:20.363 --> 04:22.381
- But we love you so much!
- We love you!

04:22.399 --> 04:23.549
I'm loveable!

04:23.567 --> 04:25.317
So do you wanna know the sex?

04:25.335 --> 04:27.136
Oh, my God.
Should we?

04:27.170 --> 04:29.254
N-no, right?
Or maybe yes?

04:29.272 --> 04:31.157
Is there an option
other than yes or no?

04:31.191 --> 04:32.291
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

04:32.325 --> 04:33.709
I'm gonna write it down.

04:33.743 --> 04:35.427
Then I'm gonna put it
in an envelope,

04:35.462 --> 04:36.512
seal it, and when you're ready,

04:36.563 --> 04:37.847
voila!

04:37.898 --> 04:40.449
- That'll be fun!
- That's like the Oscars.

04:40.484 --> 04:42.334
[Laughs]
Hey, let's get some food.

04:42.368 --> 04:43.586
I'm starving.

04:43.637 --> 04:45.104
Wait, no, I have to pee.

04:45.138 --> 04:46.522
Wait, no, I have to barf.

04:46.556 --> 04:48.307
Actually, all three.

04:48.325 --> 04:50.509
Being pregnant is great.

04:50.544 --> 04:53.462
And, finally, Larry's share
of the profit.

04:53.513 --> 04:54.730
Whoa! Good to be Larry.

04:54.764 --> 04:55.815
No, it's not,
you boring grandpa.

04:55.849 --> 04:58.617
Meanwhile, Tommy's ridin' high.

04:58.635 --> 04:59.751
$32,000.

04:59.769 --> 05:00.919
I'm basically a millionaire.

05:00.937 --> 05:02.154
What are you gonna do
with the money, Tom?

05:02.189 --> 05:03.405
Glad you asked.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.457
A horrible man recently gave me
some great advice.

05:05.492 --> 05:07.893
For years, I've been coming up
with my own ideas.

05:07.928 --> 05:10.129
Like some sort of
non-rich idiot.

05:10.163 --> 05:12.097
Now I'm gonna let people
come to me

05:12.115 --> 05:13.866
and invest my scrilla
in the best idea I hear.

05:13.900 --> 05:14.867
That sounds like

05:14.885 --> 05:16.552
an efficient use
of the free market.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.320
I would wish you
the best of luck,

05:18.355 --> 05:21.156
but I believe luck is
a concept invented by the weak

05:21.208 --> 05:22.591
to explain their failures.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.209
Come hear the ideas
with me, Ron.

05:24.227 --> 05:25.728
I could use your wise,
grandfatherly advice.

05:25.779 --> 05:28.280
Do you think everyone here
is a grandfather?

05:28.314 --> 05:29.281
Basically, if you're
older than me,

05:29.299 --> 05:30.449
you're a grandpa.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.783
And if you are a grandpa,
you're dead.

05:31.801 --> 05:32.751
That sounds right.

05:32.769 --> 05:33.769
Uh, oops.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.141
This check is made out
to "Lenny,"

05:35.155 --> 05:36.906
which I think is a typo
for "Larry,"

05:36.957 --> 05:38.541
which isn't
even actually my name.

05:38.575 --> 05:40.676
[Laughs] Well, tell it
to the bank, Lenny.

05:40.727 --> 05:43.095
Am I--am I Lenny now?

05:43.129 --> 05:46.065
I'd like to order
a singing telegram.

05:46.099 --> 05:49.251
Well, my wife lost her job,
so maybe something sad and slow.

05:49.286 --> 05:50.352
Do you know anything from

05:50.387 --> 05:51.937
<i>The Requiem for a Dream</i>
soundtrack?

05:51.972 --> 05:53.155
This is a bad idea.

05:53.189 --> 05:54.557
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.441
Well, Ingrid is settled
into my office,

05:56.459 --> 05:58.460
and this box contains
the last of my stuff.

05:58.511 --> 06:00.462
Although I might have left
some salt packets in my desk.

06:00.513 --> 06:02.047
Maybe I should go back
for those?

06:02.081 --> 06:03.816
Honey, it's okay,
there'll be other salt packets.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.734
But not the kind
that snaps in half, maybe.

06:05.785 --> 06:07.670
Okay, I know
I'm a broken record,

06:07.704 --> 06:09.788
but getting away
from the City Council

06:09.822 --> 06:11.262
is absolutely
the best thing for you.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.559
Trust me.

06:13.593 --> 06:15.861
This is Perd Hapley
talking to you now

06:15.896 --> 06:18.230
about what's going on today.

06:18.248 --> 06:19.832
We're live at City Hall

06:19.866 --> 06:21.967
where City Councilman Dexhart
is addressing

06:22.001 --> 06:23.319
his latest sex scandal.

06:23.353 --> 06:26.188
Recently, certain allegations
have come to light

06:26.222 --> 06:28.457
about my inappropriate conduct.

06:28.491 --> 06:31.477
I'm here
to set the record straight.

06:31.511 --> 06:35.147
I totally did all of it.

06:35.181 --> 06:37.366
Another sex scandal?
This guy's unbelievable.

06:37.417 --> 06:38.751
How does he find the time?

06:38.785 --> 06:41.420
I also engaged in
inappropriate texting,

06:41.454 --> 06:44.673
sexting,
and tex-mexting,

06:44.708 --> 06:47.326
which is where you send
photos of your junk

06:47.360 --> 06:49.778
from the restroom
of a chili's to go.

06:49.813 --> 06:51.630
- Hmm.
- Ew.

06:51.648 --> 06:53.465
Does this make me a bad boy?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.234
You tell me.

06:55.268 --> 06:56.485
No. Really.

06:56.519 --> 06:57.536
Tell me.

06:57.570 --> 06:59.905
It gets me off
when women tell me that.

06:59.923 --> 07:01.423
He's reading this,
he wrote this down.

07:01.458 --> 07:04.443
I sent these texts
to roughly 100 women

07:04.477 --> 07:06.545
under the following pseudonyms:
[Clears throat]

07:06.563 --> 07:07.879
Enrique Shockwave,

07:07.897 --> 07:10.115
Willie Dynamite,

07:10.150 --> 07:12.518
Lee Harvey Teabag...

07:12.552 --> 07:13.719
Well, at least
you won't have to deal

07:13.737 --> 07:15.104
with that guy anymore.

07:15.155 --> 07:17.055
- You're right.
- Lieutenant Wilhelm Von Penis.

07:17.073 --> 07:19.224
Not after someone beats him
in the next election.

07:19.242 --> 07:21.610
Someone who is smart
and hard-working

07:21.661 --> 07:24.029
and who knows the job
because she's done it already

07:24.063 --> 07:26.165
and is also blond
and named Leslie

07:26.199 --> 07:27.166
and loves you.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.668
- Is it you?
- Yes! It is!

07:29.703 --> 07:30.836
I'm gonna run again.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.338
I'm gonna beat Dexhart!

07:32.372 --> 07:33.505
And Anthony Weiner.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.804
Another City Council campaign?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.238
Leslie, think about what you're saying.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.446
I did. I challenge you
to find one flaw in my plan.

07:40.497 --> 07:41.747
Well, for one,

07:41.798 --> 07:43.065
we don't even live
in Dexhart's district.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.183
Not yet!

07:44.542 --> 07:46.426
But we can go and rent
a second apartment,

07:46.477 --> 07:48.345
and we can spend 51%
of our time there.

07:48.379 --> 07:49.696
And then I'll file
the campaign form

07:49.731 --> 07:51.131
from that address.

07:51.165 --> 07:53.717
I don't want to spend 51%
of our time in his district.

07:53.751 --> 07:55.902
It's basically a dumping ground
for old shipping containers.

07:55.937 --> 07:58.154
It's like a raccoon shantytown.

07:58.172 --> 07:59.373
Oh, it's not that bad.

07:59.424 --> 08:01.341
And also, Dexhart fights dirty.

08:01.392 --> 08:02.559
He's never lost an election

08:02.577 --> 08:05.379
because he runs brutal,
scorched-earth campaigns.

08:05.413 --> 08:06.880
So what? I got plenty
of dirt on that scumbag.

08:06.914 --> 08:08.098
I say, "Bring it on."

08:08.132 --> 08:09.449
So I'm gonna start

08:09.484 --> 08:11.001
my negative PR blitz
against Dexhart and--

08:11.035 --> 08:14.638
Look, I just think we need
to take a deep breath...

08:14.656 --> 08:16.273
Think about
if this is really worth it.

08:16.307 --> 08:20.010
Anything is worth me
getting back on City Council.

08:20.044 --> 08:21.612
Okay.
[Claps once]

08:21.646 --> 08:23.530
Let's see which one
of these lucky visionaries

08:23.564 --> 08:25.532
is gonna make me rich.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.718
Greg Phillips!

08:27.752 --> 08:29.303
Hi, guys, thanks
for meeting with me.

08:29.354 --> 08:30.404
Enough chitchat. What's
your pitch, kid?

08:30.438 --> 08:31.855
Come on, time is money,
money is power,

08:31.889 --> 08:33.307
power is pizza,
pizza is knowledge.

08:33.341 --> 08:34.508
- Let's go.
- Okay.

08:34.558 --> 08:38.996
So my idea is for an abacus,
but on your phone.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.530
I call it a "phone-bacus."

08:41.566 --> 08:44.634
Son, you just described
a calculator.

08:44.652 --> 08:46.770
Hey, but you're talking
about it, right?

08:46.804 --> 08:47.838
Three words:

08:47.872 --> 08:50.207
Automated word counter.

08:50.241 --> 08:51.641
Get out.

08:51.659 --> 08:53.109
[Robotic voice]
Two. Words.

08:53.127 --> 08:55.345
- No.
- One. Word.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.014
As you may know,

08:57.048 --> 08:59.533
I do like to tinker with things
in my garage.

08:59.584 --> 09:01.818
I'm gonna hit the can
while he's up.

09:01.836 --> 09:03.136
So I think I have discovered

09:03.171 --> 09:07.541
a way to generate
clean, renewable energy.

09:07.575 --> 09:09.309
I think it's gonna ch--

09:09.344 --> 09:10.394
[sneezes]

09:10.428 --> 09:11.461
Oh! Gross!

09:11.479 --> 09:12.646
God, Larry.

09:12.697 --> 09:13.730
You sneezed all over us!

09:13.764 --> 09:14.831
I'm not gonna buy that thing.

09:14.865 --> 09:16.466
It's covered in a gallon
of your boogers.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.301
I totally understand.

09:19.354 --> 09:22.205
[Sneezes]

09:22.240 --> 09:23.790
Uh, jeez.

09:23.841 --> 09:26.576
I will be thrilled
if we have a girl.

09:26.611 --> 09:28.195
Oh, tiny dresses?

09:28.246 --> 09:29.612
Braids?
Glitter on everything?

09:29.630 --> 09:30.630
Forget it.

09:30.665 --> 09:32.399
And also, girls' names
are so cute.

09:32.450 --> 09:34.901
Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly.

09:34.952 --> 09:38.939
Olive, rosemary, chicken.
Fifty burritos.

09:38.973 --> 09:40.557
Oh, my God, I'm starving.
Miss, hi!

09:40.575 --> 09:42.626
I'm pregnant, and I'm
a little bit crazy.

09:42.660 --> 09:43.710
So if you don't bring
our appetizers out

09:43.761 --> 09:44.995
in the next 30 seconds,

09:45.029 --> 09:48.398
I'm gonna plunge your face
into the deep fryer!

09:48.416 --> 09:49.383
And also two waters, please.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.034
But no hurry.

09:51.052 --> 09:52.319
Thank you.

09:52.353 --> 09:53.437
Leslie, I don't know
if there's a story

09:53.471 --> 09:54.637
in these emails.

09:54.655 --> 09:56.089
They're iffy,

09:56.124 --> 09:57.707
but Dexhart
has been elected eight times.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.593
I don't think the voters care.

09:59.644 --> 10:01.678
His poll numbers are actually up
since the scandal broke.

10:01.696 --> 10:02.812
Well, that's
just because people found out

10:02.830 --> 10:04.364
he was Miley Cyrus' cousin.

10:04.415 --> 10:05.882
- He is?
- Good morning, Leslie.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.934
"Sweet jugs."

10:10.071 --> 10:11.187
What?

10:11.205 --> 10:12.572
He's kinda cute.

10:12.607 --> 10:14.007
Oh, God, Shauna, no.

10:14.058 --> 10:16.309
I-I just feel like
I could fix him, you know?

10:16.360 --> 10:17.577
[Puffs]

10:17.612 --> 10:19.229
This sucks!

10:19.263 --> 10:21.498
We heard a hundred pitches,
and they're all terrible.

10:21.516 --> 10:23.150
Change of plans.

10:23.184 --> 10:24.151
You guys are my idea factory.

10:24.202 --> 10:25.836
- April, go.
- Okay, got one.

10:25.870 --> 10:27.737
Macaroni and poison.

10:27.755 --> 10:30.173
It's like mac and cheese,
but with a special ingredient.

10:30.207 --> 10:31.174
Ron?

10:31.192 --> 10:32.609
Every socket set
I've ever bought

10:32.643 --> 10:34.494
only goes up to 1/2 inch.

10:34.545 --> 10:36.413
I'd love a couple larger sizes.

10:36.447 --> 10:38.848
Take it all the way up to 5/8.

10:38.866 --> 10:39.866
Andy?

10:39.917 --> 10:43.970
Bears bouncing
on trampoline roads.

10:44.021 --> 10:46.823
There's a chance
that I might have dreamed that.

10:46.858 --> 10:49.126
Okay, time to head back
to the office.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.011
I've missed
an entire day of work,

10:51.045 --> 10:54.614
so at least some good
came from this.

10:54.649 --> 10:56.065
What are you doing?

10:56.083 --> 10:57.868
Well, they couldn't make
a banner in time

10:57.902 --> 11:00.570
for my press conference,
so I am cobbling together

11:00.605 --> 11:02.906
a banner from
all the other discarded banners.

11:02.940 --> 11:06.126
"Second chunce four Lesle!

11:06.177 --> 11:10.247
"Perv Dexxxhrt equals...

11:10.281 --> 11:12.215
- birthday mouse"?
- Rat!

11:12.250 --> 11:13.950
Well, that's the closest thing
I could get to a rat.

11:13.968 --> 11:15.802
[Scoffs]
Leslie, listen to yourself.

11:15.853 --> 11:18.822
Loopholes,
scorched-earth policies.

11:18.856 --> 11:20.207
This isn't you.

11:20.241 --> 11:22.158
I cannot believe you aren't
supporting me on this!

11:22.176 --> 11:24.861
Dexhart has a sex scandal
the same day I'm leaving office?

11:24.896 --> 11:26.613
That is not a coincidence.

11:26.647 --> 11:27.664
This was meant to be.

11:27.698 --> 11:28.748
You know what?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.333
Why don't we gather everyone
in here,

11:30.367 --> 11:32.552
you explain to them
what you're thinking,

11:32.587 --> 11:33.937
and, uh, we get some feedback.

11:33.971 --> 11:35.956
[Snaps] Now you're talking.

11:35.990 --> 11:38.041
I would be thrilled
if we had a boy.

11:38.075 --> 11:40.510
I have perfected the art
of shaving the human face.

11:40.544 --> 11:42.479
And I would love to be able
to pass that on.

11:42.513 --> 11:44.865
Toy trucks?
Superhero costumes?

11:44.899 --> 11:46.950
Tiny little acorn penis?
Forget it.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.151
A weird image.

11:48.169 --> 11:50.370
But one that does not diminish
my enthusiasm.

11:50.404 --> 11:52.222
Well, Ann Perkins,

11:52.256 --> 11:54.090
are you ready to find out
the sex of our baby?

11:54.108 --> 11:55.992
[Clink]
I'm ready.

11:56.027 --> 11:58.094
We are having a...

11:58.129 --> 12:00.647
"distributions."

12:00.681 --> 12:02.298
That's what it looks like:
Distributions.

12:02.316 --> 12:03.700
Let me see that.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.919
It says "congratulations,"
I think.

12:05.953 --> 12:07.036
Then it says,

12:07.054 --> 12:09.089
"I...leg smurf."

12:09.140 --> 12:10.257
Are we having a smurf?

12:10.308 --> 12:13.527
We are having a...
"11-jewel toilet."

12:13.561 --> 12:15.645
I can't tell what's words
and what's punctuation!

12:15.663 --> 12:16.997
The suspense is killing me!

12:17.031 --> 12:17.998
I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.

12:18.049 --> 12:19.382
I'm calling Domino's.

12:19.416 --> 12:20.767
Do you think Domino's delivers
to this restaurant?

12:20.801 --> 12:22.819
- I hope so.
- Oh, no.

12:22.854 --> 12:24.054
He's out
for the rest of the day!

12:24.088 --> 12:28.124
I have literally never been
more stressed out.

12:28.159 --> 12:29.826
Oh, good! You guys are here!

12:29.861 --> 12:31.561
Okay, everybody gather around.
I have a big announcement.

12:31.596 --> 12:34.064
I am officially
seeking reelection

12:34.098 --> 12:35.448
to the Pawnee City Council.

12:35.483 --> 12:37.584
I am gonna be running
for Dexhart's seat.

12:37.618 --> 12:41.504
And the campaign starts now.

12:41.538 --> 12:44.474
Oh, I love the sound of silence

12:44.508 --> 12:46.092
before a big cheer.

12:46.143 --> 12:47.727
That's what's happening, right?

12:47.762 --> 12:49.062
Leslie, no offense.

12:49.096 --> 12:50.680
I've heard a lot
of bad ideas today.

12:50.714 --> 12:53.149
- This is the worst.
- April?

12:53.184 --> 12:55.402
I would love it if you ran
an insane campaign

12:55.436 --> 12:57.571
and basically turned
into the joker.

12:57.605 --> 12:59.689
But that means you probably
shouldn't do it.

12:59.723 --> 13:00.774
- Andy?
- I don't know, Leslie.

13:00.825 --> 13:02.158
It seems risky.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.354
And I'd hate to see you
go through another tough fight.

13:04.362 --> 13:05.779
But I could be wrong.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.080
I haven't pooped in three days.

13:07.114 --> 13:09.799
Okay, Ron, you have always
given me sage counsel.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.801
And your words
carry great influence so...

13:11.835 --> 13:13.136
what do you think I should do?

13:13.170 --> 13:14.854
I do not think
you should run again.

13:14.889 --> 13:16.250
What the hell do you know,
Dum-Dum?

13:16.274 --> 13:18.725
All of you! Look,
this is my only option.

13:18.776 --> 13:20.477
I am running again
with or without you.

13:20.511 --> 13:22.779
Leslie, you're running
for office again?

13:22.813 --> 13:24.230
What a great idea!

13:24.282 --> 13:25.482
How can I help?

13:25.516 --> 13:26.750
Ugh...

13:29.275 --> 13:31.501
Well, no one else brought
me good business ideas.

13:31.621 --> 13:33.334
So I decided to
take care of it myself.

13:34.733 --> 13:35.850
Talking tissue!

13:35.884 --> 13:36.924
Any time you pull one out,

13:36.968 --> 13:38.502
you get a little message
to hype you up.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.070
[Tom's voice]
Blow that nose, playah!

13:40.105 --> 13:41.271
No.

13:41.289 --> 13:43.290
[Sighs] This stinks.

13:43.341 --> 13:44.925
I'm just gonna have to go back
to my same job

13:44.960 --> 13:46.277
that I've had forever.

13:46.311 --> 13:47.745
Yeah, I get
why you're bummed out.

13:47.779 --> 13:48.779
I mean, look at me.

13:48.813 --> 13:50.447
I'm younger than you,

13:50.482 --> 13:51.715
and I already have
my own department.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.068
Plus I'm married,
and I make more money than you.

13:54.119 --> 13:55.469
Whatever. You just merged
your department with parks

13:55.503 --> 13:56.954
then made up your own title.

13:56.972 --> 13:58.088
[Snickering] Yeah.

13:58.106 --> 13:59.556
It's awesome.

13:59.574 --> 14:00.574
[Tom's voice] I'm empty, yo.

14:00.609 --> 14:03.878
Fill me up.

14:03.929 --> 14:05.963
Do that again.

14:05.997 --> 14:08.332
[Knock on door]

14:08.366 --> 14:11.602
What could you possibly need
at 6:00 in the morning?

14:11.636 --> 14:12.916
We couldn't read your writing,

14:12.938 --> 14:14.499
and we need
to know the sex of our baby.

14:14.522 --> 14:16.790
I'm watching cartoons
with my son.

14:16.825 --> 14:17.892
Daddy!

14:17.926 --> 14:19.543
An Elmer Fudd one is on!

14:19.561 --> 14:21.262
Stop it.
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

14:21.296 --> 14:23.080
Jean-Ralphio.
I live in the guesthouse.

14:23.114 --> 14:24.381
What do you say
you and I get together

14:24.416 --> 14:25.849
in a special way?

14:25.884 --> 14:26.901
I-I'm pregnant.

14:26.935 --> 14:28.535
- The more the merrier.
- With my baby.

14:28.570 --> 14:29.670
Well, you can come too,
beautiful.

14:29.704 --> 14:30.888
Look at that.

14:30.922 --> 14:33.090
I guess sometimes
I call men "beautiful" too.

14:33.108 --> 14:36.577
I guess I'm
[Singing] open-minded as hell.

14:36.628 --> 14:38.762
And I think
you're pretty good-looking.

14:38.797 --> 14:40.237
- Thank you.
- Can you just read that

14:40.265 --> 14:41.732
and tell us
what the sex is, please?

14:41.766 --> 14:42.933
Wow.

14:42.951 --> 14:44.234
It looks like
the chicken that wrote this

14:44.252 --> 14:45.753
had a stroke on the paper.

14:45.804 --> 14:46.887
[Laughter]

14:46.938 --> 14:48.689
Listen, I-I kind of remember.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.124
But I don't want to say
anything that's wrong.

14:50.158 --> 14:51.659
Give me 15 minutes.

14:51.710 --> 14:52.927
I will get dressed.

14:52.978 --> 14:54.895
We'll go down
to my office. Okay.

14:54.930 --> 14:56.697
Well, have a good day
at work today, daddy.

14:56.731 --> 14:58.232
Also,
if you don't know already,

14:58.266 --> 15:00.050
there's a malfunction
with the TV,

15:00.085 --> 15:01.535
where it keeps ordering porno,

15:01.569 --> 15:02.903
like, a ton of porno.

15:02.938 --> 15:05.258
Like, how can someone watch
that much porno in one sitting?

15:05.273 --> 15:06.594
Only when you're out
of the house.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.976
So if you see it on the bill,
that's why. Okay?

15:09.027 --> 15:11.261
"And therefore, with your help,

15:11.279 --> 15:13.497
"we can make our future bright.

15:13.531 --> 15:16.934
I believe I still have
a lot to offer this city."

15:16.968 --> 15:18.802
I'd swap those two lines.

15:18.820 --> 15:22.473
Always helps
to end on the call to action.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.391
I'm sorry if it felt like
everyone piled on.

15:24.442 --> 15:26.193
We were just being honest.

15:26.227 --> 15:27.678
But if you really
want to do this,

15:27.712 --> 15:29.096
of course we'll support you.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.431
Thank you.

15:30.482 --> 15:32.449
I'm sorry I stormed out.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.867
You know, I've been thinking
for weeks of what to get you

15:33.918 --> 15:35.970
as a "last day in City Council"
present.

15:36.021 --> 15:38.322
And I finally figured it out.

15:38.356 --> 15:39.406
You remember Jen Barkley,

15:39.457 --> 15:40.741
political consultant
and power broker?

15:40.792 --> 15:42.042
Hey! Jen!

15:42.093 --> 15:43.093
What brings you back to Pawnee?

15:43.128 --> 15:44.511
Ben bought one hour of my time.

15:44.562 --> 15:45.929
I heard you need
some consulting?

15:45.947 --> 15:47.965
Well, uh, I guess.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.583
I mean, how are you?
How's your family?

15:49.634 --> 15:51.518
Okay, I get paid
$1,200 an hour.

15:51.569 --> 15:53.337
Do you really wanna spend
any of that time

15:53.371 --> 15:54.404
talking about my mother

15:54.422 --> 15:56.557
and her
19-year-old Korean husband?

15:56.608 --> 15:58.008
Well, that does sound
fascinating.

15:58.009 --> 15:59.026
But you're right, let's talk.

15:59.060 --> 16:01.445
Okay.
I'll get the chair. [Laughs]

16:03.131 --> 16:05.065
[Prolonged] Ron!

16:05.100 --> 16:06.734
That's how I enter rooms now.
It's more dramatic.

16:06.785 --> 16:08.786
Why did you enter at all?

16:08.820 --> 16:10.187
Because I have some huge news.

16:10.221 --> 16:14.708
You're looking at
Pawnee's new business liaison.

16:14.743 --> 16:15.993
I don't like French words.

16:16.027 --> 16:17.328
I do like the word "business."

16:17.362 --> 16:18.612
You may continue.

16:18.646 --> 16:20.080
April created
a new position for herself,

16:20.115 --> 16:21.281
and I wanna do the same.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.833
The town could use
more private-sector money

16:22.867 --> 16:23.851
after the merger.

16:23.902 --> 16:25.135
So as business liaison,

16:25.153 --> 16:27.354
I would find companies
looking to move or expand,

16:27.389 --> 16:29.123
and convince them
to do it in Pawnee.

16:29.174 --> 16:31.041
Now this is a good idea.

16:31.059 --> 16:33.177
You've come a long way, son.

16:33.211 --> 16:35.612
And while I got you here...

16:35.646 --> 16:36.597
talking tissue.

16:36.631 --> 16:38.599
Go for it.

16:38.650 --> 16:39.650
[Tom's voice] Yo, dog!

16:39.684 --> 16:41.835
Life is what you make of it.

16:41.870 --> 16:45.339
Leave while I'm ahead?
You got it.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.025
Clear them sinuses, playboy!

16:48.059 --> 16:49.493
Someone's got the sniffies.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.744
Tell your mama you love 'er.

16:50.795 --> 16:52.496
Step up
your vitamin "C" game, bro!

16:52.530 --> 16:54.314
So they recall me
after all I've done for them.

16:54.349 --> 16:55.432
Ridiculous.

16:55.450 --> 16:56.583
But Dexhart now
has another sex scandal.

16:56.618 --> 16:57.901
Of course he does.

16:57.936 --> 16:59.720
And the plan is
I'm gonna run for his seat.

16:59.754 --> 17:02.072
Because how do I lose
to a guy like that?

17:02.107 --> 17:03.824
- That's a great idea, right?
- It's a terrible idea.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.659
I knew it. Wait. What?

17:05.710 --> 17:07.094
First of all, you <i>could</i> lose
to a guy like that.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.346
Terrible people defeat
great people all of the time.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.614
I should know.

17:10.647 --> 17:11.865
Those terrible people
have paid me so much money,

17:11.900 --> 17:13.384
I have a condo
in every virgin island.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.968
Now you might win.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.104
You're smart, Ben is smart,
you might win.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.571
But why would you want to?

17:18.606 --> 17:20.523
Because it's my dream job.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.825
Then dream bigger.

17:21.843 --> 17:23.794
Look, you love this town.

17:23.828 --> 17:24.895
It's being run
by monsters and morons?

17:24.929 --> 17:26.180
Get a better job!

17:26.231 --> 17:27.781
Rise above their heads.

17:27.816 --> 17:29.900
Affect change at a higher level.

17:29.918 --> 17:30.968
Don't be the kid
that graduates high school,

17:31.002 --> 17:32.586
hangs out
in the school parking lot.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.388
Be the woman who moves away,

17:34.439 --> 17:36.607
climbs the ladder,
and then confidently comes back

17:36.641 --> 17:38.008
and has sex
with her hot old English teacher

17:38.042 --> 17:39.443
just for kicks.

17:39.461 --> 17:40.961
Is that what you did?

17:41.012 --> 17:42.012
Yeah. Mr. Baker.

17:42.046 --> 17:43.597
Sex was pretty good,
thanks to me.

17:43.648 --> 17:45.983
Look, Pawnee
has done you a favor.

17:46.017 --> 17:47.451
You've outgrown them.

17:47.485 --> 17:49.786
You've got talent, and
you've got name recognition.

17:49.804 --> 17:52.272
Which means that you have
a bright, wide-open future

17:52.323 --> 17:54.408
with a thousand options.

17:54.442 --> 17:56.026
State Senate.

17:56.060 --> 17:57.194
Federal jobs.

17:57.228 --> 17:58.796
Even congress.

17:58.830 --> 18:01.432
All of these are doable for you.

18:01.466 --> 18:04.301
And you can trust me...

18:05.904 --> 18:09.189
because I don't care
enough about you to lie.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.991
[Ringtone plays]

18:11.025 --> 18:12.659
Uh-oh. Oh, time's up.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.644
Okay, if you want
to keep talking,

18:14.662 --> 18:15.996
you're gonna have to pay me
1,200 more dollars.

18:16.030 --> 18:18.081
- I just need--
- No, I swear to God,

18:18.116 --> 18:20.584
if you say one more word,
you will legally owe me $1,200,

18:20.618 --> 18:22.986
and I will sue you.
Let's not end it like that.

18:23.004 --> 18:24.755
Okay, great to see you, Leslie.

18:24.789 --> 18:26.039
Those five words are on me.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.258
Should I move this back?
Don't answer it!

18:29.257 --> 18:30.327
I don't know
what you're thinking,

18:30.345 --> 18:34.014
but you have a press conference
in ten minutes.

18:36.212 --> 18:37.689
Well, this is it...

18:37.929 --> 18:39.231
The final moment..

18:39.615 --> 18:41.005
What are you hoping for?

18:41.526 --> 18:44.070
I will honestly be happy
either way.

18:44.192 --> 18:45.226
Me too.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.061
Boy or girl,

18:47.095 --> 18:48.395
it doesn't matter.

18:48.429 --> 18:50.481
Because it will literally be

18:50.532 --> 18:52.616
the greatest child
who's ever lived.

18:52.651 --> 18:54.902
You swear you have
no preference?

18:54.936 --> 18:55.953
You?

18:55.987 --> 18:58.706
Not at all.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.824
Who's ready? Raise your hand.

19:00.876 --> 19:03.210
It's a boy!
Both: Yes!

19:03.245 --> 19:04.662
I thought you didn't have
a preference.

19:04.713 --> 19:06.547
I didn't. I just really
wanted it to be a boy.

19:06.581 --> 19:07.581
Me too.

19:07.615 --> 19:09.333
I don't know why.

19:09.384 --> 19:10.801
You guys are just so neat.

19:10.835 --> 19:13.120
Would you be interested
in adopting my children?

19:13.138 --> 19:15.222
They're in their late 20s,
they're terrible.

19:15.257 --> 19:16.807
No? No go?

19:16.841 --> 19:19.810
[Chuckles]
I ask all my patients.

19:19.844 --> 19:22.229
I've gathered you all
here today

19:22.264 --> 19:23.564
because I have an announcement,

19:23.598 --> 19:28.686
a very big announcement,
about my future.

19:28.737 --> 19:32.940
I will be heading to lunch today
with my husband.

19:32.974 --> 19:34.441
At JJ's diner.

19:34.475 --> 19:36.777
We will eat waffles.

19:36.811 --> 19:38.662
And then we will go home
and make out on our couch.

19:38.697 --> 19:40.331
That is my future.

19:40.365 --> 19:43.951
For now.

19:43.985 --> 19:48.372
It's been an honor
to serve this town.

19:48.423 --> 19:51.175
And I will cherish the memories
forever.

19:51.209 --> 19:53.093
Thank you.

19:53.128 --> 19:54.712
- Ms. Knope!
- There you have it.

19:54.763 --> 19:56.931
A shockingly unshocking
press conference

19:56.965 --> 19:58.682
in which
a recently unemployed woman

19:58.717 --> 20:00.684
said nothing of importance.

20:00.719 --> 20:02.052
I'm Perd Hapley,

20:02.103 --> 20:04.727
and I just realized
I'm not holding my microphone.

20:05.174 --> 20:07.891
Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was

20:08.011 --> 20:10.042
the best present I could have got.
Thank you.

20:10.162 --> 20:11.010
You're welcome.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.958
But, I did get you one other present

20:13.078 --> 20:14.321
to take your mind off all this.

20:14.441 --> 20:16.753
Aww, you are the sweetest man in the world.
Where is it?

20:16.873 --> 20:19.371
Well, it's not here.

20:19.491 --> 20:20.928
We have to go get it.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.074

20:31.456 --> 20:34.516
In times of stress or in moments
of transition,

20:34.636 --> 20:37.849
sometimes it can feel like the whole world
is closing in on you.

20:38.211 --> 20:42.476
When that happens, you should close
your eyes, take a deep breath,

20:42.596 --> 20:45.409
listen to the people that love you
when they're giving advice,

20:45.752 --> 20:47.957
and remember what really matters.

20:48.077 --> 20:51.230
And, if you have the ability to go to Paris,
by all means,

20:51.516 --> 20:52.466
got to Paris!

20:52.586 --> 20:54.269
- I found one!
- Oh, great!

20:54.389 --> 20:56.305
- Mm, right here.
- Yeah?
