00:01.770 --> 00:03.380
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

00:03.415 --> 00:06.096
It'll be my honor to host
your engagement party.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.773
Things will never be the same.

00:07.807 --> 00:10.409
You are to be married,
and that is that.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.877
She is Ilona.

00:11.911 --> 00:14.780
You must never again mention
Mina Murray's resemblance to my wife.

00:14.814 --> 00:18.951
I need your blood to create a serum
so you are able to conquer daylight.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.553
I want you to find out everything
about this General Shaw.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.056
He's a powerful ally
of my competitors.

00:24.090 --> 00:27.893
Vera Markham can tell you
all you need to know about Shaw.

00:27.927 --> 00:28.893
Yes?

00:28.927 --> 00:31.296
You wish to employ my services

00:31.330 --> 00:34.765
in order to get Mr. Renfield
to answer one question.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.867
Unh!

01:02.160 --> 01:05.095
Mr. Grayson.
What are you doing here?

01:05.129 --> 01:06.997
I know I shouldn't be here,

01:07.031 --> 01:08.398
but there's no time.

01:08.433 --> 01:11.168
Time for what?

01:11.202 --> 01:13.470
No. You must leave,
immediately, or...

01:13.505 --> 01:14.904
I'll go.

01:14.939 --> 01:17.274
I promise.

01:17.308 --> 01:21.645
But I must tell you,
you're making a mistake.

01:21.679 --> 01:23.680
A terrible mistake.

01:23.714 --> 01:26.082
- What do you mean?
- Harker.

01:26.117 --> 01:29.318
He'll never be able to make you happy,
and you know it.

01:29.353 --> 01:31.287
How dare you.

01:31.321 --> 01:34.124
Now is not the time for lies, Mina.

01:34.158 --> 01:36.091
You know it's the truth.

01:36.126 --> 01:37.926
If it isn't, say it.

01:37.961 --> 01:40.129
Look me in the eyes and say it,

01:40.164 --> 01:41.930
- and I'll go.
- No, no, no.

01:41.965 --> 01:46.101
I-I love... I love Jonathan,
and no other,

01:46.136 --> 01:48.137
and he will be my husband.

02:27.683 --> 02:30.202
Of all the days to lie-in.

02:33.530 --> 02:36.510
Don't you know we have a million
things to do before tonight?

02:37.823 --> 02:40.496
- It's still on?
- Of course it's still on!

02:41.076 --> 02:45.607
- Unless you've reconsidered.
- No. No. No, of course not.

02:47.804 --> 02:50.495
Well then, for goodness' sake,
get up, darling.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.827
You mustn't waste another second
of this momentous day.

02:53.843 --> 02:55.229
Yours is going to be

02:55.244 --> 02:58.079
the most spectacular engagement party
London has ever seen.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.422
Be careful.
That's very fragile.

03:08.457 --> 03:10.885
Come and meet
your first test subject.

03:11.593 --> 03:14.094
Place it in line with the door,
please.

03:15.697 --> 03:18.867
And no obstruction
that may cast a shadow!

03:28.443 --> 03:30.311
I wouldn't get too close, Professor.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.147
I think you'll find her suitable,

03:33.181 --> 03:35.149
if not exactly agreeable.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.422
There are many technical challenges,

03:42.456 --> 03:44.825
but I believe we will
surmount them, given time.

03:44.859 --> 03:47.527
Time is a luxury we do not have.

03:50.165 --> 03:51.965
I must walk in sunlight soon.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.101
People are getting suspicious.

03:54.135 --> 03:57.970
Do you understand?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.939
By the way, where's Renfield?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.608
He was meant to accompany
the lab equipment.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.076
Renfield was nowhere to be found.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.112
I had to do it myself.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.959
Mr. Renfield.

04:19.993 --> 04:24.130
We are about to embark
on a journey, you and I.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.965
It begins with a single question,

04:25.999 --> 04:29.301
and it ends with your answer
to that question.

04:35.942 --> 04:40.312
I want you to remember that,
so I will say it again.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.849
It ends with your answer.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.985
So you see, no matter
how helpless you may feel,

04:47.019 --> 04:51.823
no matter how lengthy,
debasing, and disagreeable

04:51.858 --> 04:54.326
the journey may prove,

04:54.360 --> 04:57.062
ultimately, you are in control.

04:59.131 --> 05:02.066
Let's get started, shall we?

05:06.472 --> 05:10.875
Though I take great pride
in my profession,

05:10.909 --> 05:13.010
it has become...

05:14.813 --> 05:17.147
tedious of late.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.786
There are, after all,

05:22.820 --> 05:26.523
only so many variations
on a theme one can play.

05:26.557 --> 05:29.426
Release me.

05:30.862 --> 05:34.063
Unh!

05:34.098 --> 05:38.435
Each client is unique, of course.

05:38.469 --> 05:40.370
The methods vary,

05:40.405 --> 05:43.740
but the result
is inevitably the same.

05:43.775 --> 05:46.510
I'm warning you,

05:46.544 --> 05:48.578
there will be repercussions.

05:51.382 --> 05:55.684
I often think,
"Perhaps this time, Janina.

05:55.719 --> 05:57.586
"This time, for once,

05:57.621 --> 06:00.456
"the client will dispense with
all the bluster and defiance

06:00.490 --> 06:03.793
and simply answer the question
the first time I ask it."

06:14.504 --> 06:17.773
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

06:21.144 --> 06:24.313
Oh, well.

06:24.347 --> 06:26.315
Perhaps next time.

06:30.586 --> 06:35.421

www.addic7ed.com

06:55.888 --> 06:58.799
These are General Shaw's
personal accounts.

06:58.822 --> 07:01.056
It's all there,
under Bellamy Limited.

07:01.090 --> 07:02.157
Bellamy?

07:02.191 --> 07:05.494
Sole shareholder, empire munitions.

07:05.528 --> 07:07.296
Empire munitions?

07:07.330 --> 07:10.765
Shaw's receiving money
from an arms manufacturer?

07:15.704 --> 07:18.073
60,000 pounds in July.

07:18.107 --> 07:20.876
July, that's when... That's when
the empire won the tender

07:20.910 --> 07:22.477
for eight new warships.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.780
He got commission.

07:24.814 --> 07:26.915
General Shaw is taking bribes.

07:26.949 --> 07:28.583
Harker, please.

07:28.617 --> 07:32.420
What do you plan to do
with this information?

07:45.934 --> 07:47.768
I know you begged me
to organize this party

07:47.803 --> 07:49.236
and I agreed,
but that doesn't give you

07:49.271 --> 07:51.839
the right to be an idle princess.

07:51.873 --> 07:54.208
You have the guest list.
I have the replies.

07:54.242 --> 07:55.976
You check the former
against the latter,

07:56.011 --> 07:58.612
and the kitchen needs
the final count by noon.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.748
This list, it's all wrong.

08:01.783 --> 08:04.685
Lord Davenport. Lord Rothcroft?

08:04.719 --> 08:05.919
Who'd ever have guessed

08:05.953 --> 08:07.387
that Jonathan had
such distinguished friends?

08:07.422 --> 08:08.622
Yes, but they're not his friends.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.557
At least,
he's never mentioned them.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.459
All my doing, I'm afraid.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.127
I insisted he invite them.

08:14.161 --> 08:18.064
It's all rather overwhelming,
Mr. Grayson.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.966
Are you sure it's not too much
of an imposition?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.567
Not at all.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.270
This is just an empty stage
upon which Miss Westenra

08:24.305 --> 08:26.605
has lavished her formidable magic.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.374
At least somebody
appreciates all my hard work.

08:28.408 --> 08:32.378
Alexander!
You won't believe what...

08:32.412 --> 08:35.648
Mina.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.916
Could we have a word
privately, please?

08:37.951 --> 08:40.486
Ladies, if you will excuse us.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.020
Shaw is far from a saint,
and I've got

08:43.056 --> 08:44.923
- the evidence to prove it.
- Not now.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.427
- I've just had a meeting.
- I said, leave it.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.270
Lucy, you'll probably
think me a spoiled child...

08:58.304 --> 09:00.839
Impossible.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.876
What's wrong?

09:03.910 --> 09:07.846
I had the most perplexing dream.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.815
Really?

09:10.850 --> 09:12.149
That kind of dream?

09:12.184 --> 09:14.352
No. Not that kind of dream.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.687
Tell me...

09:15.721 --> 09:17.789
Was the dream version
of Jonathan more circumspect,

09:17.823 --> 09:20.224
or was it merely a matter
of circumference?

09:20.259 --> 09:21.292
No.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.762
And it wasn't even...

09:28.666 --> 09:29.833
It wasn't even Jonathan.

09:29.868 --> 09:32.970
Yes, of course.
Of course it was Jonathan.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.544
Renfield went
to Victoria Station last night

09:40.578 --> 09:42.846
to pick up some
laboratory equipment.

09:42.881 --> 09:44.381
He never arrived,

09:44.416 --> 09:47.885
and he has not
been heard from since.

09:47.919 --> 09:50.120
Well, perhaps he was detained.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.556
He's been missing nine hours.

09:52.590 --> 09:55.492
He would have sent word.

09:55.527 --> 09:56.560
Shall I contact the police?

09:56.594 --> 09:59.629
No, no. No police.

09:59.663 --> 10:01.965
This must be handled
with the utmost discretion.

10:01.999 --> 10:05.068
At this point of our business,
Grayson Energy cannot afford a scandal.

10:05.102 --> 10:06.769
I'm sure you understand that
more than anyone.

10:06.804 --> 10:09.906
Of course.

10:09.941 --> 10:12.309
Well, I'll start with the hospitals,
the morgues.

10:12.343 --> 10:15.078
Did he have any appointments prior
to picking up the equipment?

10:15.112 --> 10:19.148
Only to gather some information
from local steel mills.

10:19.182 --> 10:21.784
Well, that narrows things
down a bit.

10:21.819 --> 10:24.787
He's hardly inconspicuous.

10:24.822 --> 10:26.923
Leave it with me.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.326
Jonathan?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.261
I really must be going, Mina.

10:32.295 --> 10:33.662
Wa... Is this list right?

10:33.696 --> 10:34.863
I'm sorry.

10:34.897 --> 10:35.998
I-I have some urgent business
to attend to.

10:36.032 --> 10:37.366
We'll have to discuss this later.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.468
But the party is tonight.
It's in a few hours.

10:41.671 --> 10:44.173
Well, I-I made
a few additions, is all.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.607
Business acquaintances and so forth.

10:45.641 --> 10:47.343
It's not the additions
that concern me,

10:47.377 --> 10:49.043
it's the people
you have disinvited.

10:49.078 --> 10:50.144
Like who?

10:50.179 --> 10:52.413
All your friends at the paper.
Szabo.

10:52.448 --> 10:53.815
Szabo?

10:53.850 --> 10:55.917
Think, Mina.
We're serving alcohol.

10:55.952 --> 10:57.586
Do you really want him
juggling champagne bottles

10:57.620 --> 10:58.887
and doing
his dancing bear routine?

10:58.921 --> 11:00.254
I'm sure he will behave himself.

11:00.289 --> 11:01.356
The answer is no!

11:01.390 --> 11:02.557
We're moving up in the world,

11:02.592 --> 11:04.559
and its only natural that
we're gonna lose

11:04.594 --> 11:06.060
a few friends on the way.

11:06.095 --> 11:09.297
Would you listen to yourself?

11:14.403 --> 11:16.637
So, who else will be
in attendance?

11:16.671 --> 11:19.874
Rothcroft. A few others.

11:19.908 --> 11:24.111
I do hope there won't be another
grand spectacle this evening.

11:24.145 --> 11:27.247
Brash Americans like Grayson
are best left twisting in the wind.

11:27.281 --> 11:30.317
Once they realize their money
can't buy cooperation,

11:30.351 --> 11:33.954
they pack up and move on...
unless provoked.

11:33.989 --> 11:35.689
Of course, sir.

11:35.724 --> 11:37.090
No.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.092
There should never be any
direct action against Grayson

11:39.127 --> 11:42.762
without your express permission.

11:50.671 --> 11:53.973
I thought you'd be at Carfax
with Lucy.

11:54.008 --> 11:58.177
I was, but I thought
I'd come home and rest a while.

12:04.585 --> 12:08.320
Your mother would be
so proud of you.

12:08.355 --> 12:11.290
Hmm.

12:11.324 --> 12:13.992
You've found a fine man
in Jonathan.

12:14.027 --> 12:16.695
I know she'd be happy
with your choice.

12:16.729 --> 12:19.631
A month ago, perhaps,

12:19.666 --> 12:21.900
with the old Jonathan.

12:21.935 --> 12:24.636
But he's changed.

12:26.406 --> 12:28.840
In what way?

12:28.875 --> 12:30.075
Well, to start with,

12:30.109 --> 12:32.811
he's got an entirely new set
of friends...

12:32.845 --> 12:34.880
business associates,
most of them...

12:34.914 --> 12:37.849
and they're titled and wealthy
and much older than he is.

12:37.884 --> 12:39.417
That's perfectly natural.

12:39.452 --> 12:42.220
He's in a new line, he's bound
to make new acquaintances.

12:42.254 --> 12:45.523
Yes, but he's cut ties
with most, if not all,

12:45.558 --> 12:47.892
of his old friends,
as though they're expendable.

12:49.562 --> 12:51.996
And I can't help but think...

12:52.030 --> 12:55.933
That you might
become expendable as well?

12:55.968 --> 12:59.237
I must admit, Mr. Renfield...

13:00.339 --> 13:02.673
Your stoicism is impressive,

13:02.708 --> 13:05.776
but by no means a surprise.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.447
- Rodrigo?
- No.

13:13.852 --> 13:15.119
Please.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.861
Oh, you are strong...

13:24.895 --> 13:28.499
And clearly no stranger
to suffering.

13:28.533 --> 13:32.402
Admirable traits

13:32.437 --> 13:37.206
under virtually
every other circumstance.

13:40.011 --> 13:43.680
Alas, Mr. Renfield,

13:43.714 --> 13:47.150
not here, not now.

13:47.184 --> 13:50.120
There is just me and you.

13:52.256 --> 13:57.059
The question...and the answer!

14:00.430 --> 14:02.798
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

14:25.676 --> 14:27.810
Renfield's been abducted.

14:27.845 --> 14:28.945
By whom?

14:28.979 --> 14:30.947
We can only assume
it's the Order.

14:30.981 --> 14:34.316
But until the sun goes down,
I'm powerless to help him.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.053
Do you think they can break him?

14:37.087 --> 14:40.823
He will die before he says
a word against me.

14:40.858 --> 14:43.026
Very well, then. Problem solved.

14:43.060 --> 14:48.697
We cannot let anything
distract us from today's test.

14:48.731 --> 14:51.633
How long will
this entire process take?

14:51.668 --> 14:54.636
I will use the resonator
to generate voltage

14:54.671 --> 14:56.338
to a pair of electrical paddles,

14:56.373 --> 14:59.808
then apply them
to the subject's chest

14:59.842 --> 15:02.310
and attempt to jolt
the heart into beating.

15:04.280 --> 15:09.317
Then I will give the subject
a massive injection of the serum.

15:09.351 --> 15:11.053
If it works,

15:11.087 --> 15:15.691
you will immediately repeat
the whole process on me.

15:15.725 --> 15:18.293
But I won't have an adequate
supply of the serum.

15:18.327 --> 15:20.428
As you can see,
it's a slow process.

15:20.463 --> 15:23.298
I don't have the equipment!

16:10.978 --> 16:13.546
Hold a second.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.581
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

16:54.988 --> 16:56.388
I'm looking for a Mr. Havershim.

16:56.422 --> 16:59.457
If it's business,
call my St. Louis office.

16:59.492 --> 17:01.793
I have called your St. Louis office,

17:01.827 --> 17:05.430
and your Kansas City office,
and your Carson City office.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.665
Don't tell me, let me guess.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.702
You're Alexander Grayson.

17:15.907 --> 17:17.508
That's correct.

17:17.541 --> 17:20.944
And you want to buy
my Sweetwater operation.

17:20.979 --> 17:23.380
And your Doubletree mine.

17:23.415 --> 17:27.351
I am willing to offer you
20,000 of your American dollars.

17:27.385 --> 17:29.386
Really?

17:47.705 --> 17:50.640
Impressive.

17:50.674 --> 17:55.345
Mr. Grayson, you are either
a very brave man

17:55.379 --> 17:58.548
or a very foolish one.

17:58.582 --> 18:01.852
This is a rough country
to be traveling unarmed.

18:05.956 --> 18:07.957
I don't like guns.

18:11.027 --> 18:12.094
This is a singularly

18:12.129 --> 18:15.131
inopportune moment
to purchase a mine, sir.

18:15.165 --> 18:16.432
What the hell?

18:16.467 --> 18:19.302
Federal taxes on minerals
are set to escalate,

18:19.336 --> 18:22.071
so if you insist
on making the purchase,

18:22.105 --> 18:23.873
make sure you tender an option

18:23.907 --> 18:27.143
with a leaseback provision
to avoid the levies.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.245
Whiskey, sir?

18:29.279 --> 18:31.280
Thank you.

18:33.316 --> 18:34.583
And what's your name?

18:34.617 --> 18:38.687
Renfield.
R.M. Renfield, esquire.

18:39.955 --> 18:42.291
Alexander!

18:42.325 --> 18:43.625
You were right.

18:43.660 --> 18:46.395
Renfield was abducted
outside of Empire and Colonial

18:46.429 --> 18:48.997
yesterday afternoon around 4:00.

18:49.031 --> 18:51.400
I found a newspaper vendor.
He witnessed the whole thing.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.534
- Did he give a description?
- Mm, three men.

18:53.568 --> 18:58.673
One hit him, the others grabbed him
and threw him into a carriage.

18:58.707 --> 19:01.876
- Did he notify the police?
- He assumed it was the police.

19:01.911 --> 19:04.679
I found this.

19:04.713 --> 19:05.914
Where?

19:05.948 --> 19:09.850
In the gutter just outside
the main entrance.

19:09.884 --> 19:13.421
Shall I notify the police?

19:13.455 --> 19:14.888
No.

19:14.923 --> 19:16.924
This is all I need.

19:22.631 --> 19:23.731
I was beginning to think

19:23.765 --> 19:25.800
I would be forced
to start without you.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.734
I had an urgent matter
to attend to.

19:27.768 --> 19:30.770
And what could be
more urgent than this?

19:30.805 --> 19:32.639
Shh.

19:32.673 --> 19:36.143
I finally have a lead on Renfield.

19:36.177 --> 19:38.178
Shall we proceed?

19:46.320 --> 19:48.555
First, we start its heart.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.160
1,000 volts, circuit one.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.648
3,000 volts!

20:23.322 --> 20:26.358
3,000 volts, circuit one.

20:44.710 --> 20:48.213
It's beating.

21:35.225 --> 21:37.427
Success.

22:11.654 --> 22:14.021
You can't leave now!

22:14.056 --> 22:16.557
I must find Renfield.

22:16.591 --> 22:17.892
You are about to host a party

22:17.926 --> 22:21.129
at which known members
of the Order will be present.

22:21.163 --> 22:24.498
Professor, if you ever valued
that arm, take it off mine...

22:24.532 --> 22:26.533
immediately!

23:56.488 --> 23:58.156
Hello.

23:58.190 --> 23:59.657
Thank you.

23:59.691 --> 24:01.692
- Back in a tick, darling.
- Okay.

24:01.727 --> 24:05.463
Lovely to see you.

24:06.966 --> 24:09.300
I promised him
I will not do my dancing bear.

24:13.505 --> 24:15.740
I think it's time for me
to see to the women.

24:15.774 --> 24:18.041
If you will excuse me.

24:23.548 --> 24:24.982
- Jonathan.
- Dr. Murray.

24:25.016 --> 24:27.184
Mina, you look lovely.

24:27.218 --> 24:30.220
Thank you.

24:34.492 --> 24:35.458
You were right.

24:35.493 --> 24:37.727
I was beginning
to forget who I am.

24:40.231 --> 24:42.165
I never will.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.167
And I will always be here
to remind you.

24:45.202 --> 24:47.203
Promise?

24:58.883 --> 25:01.951
I hope Mr. Grayson likes
what we've done with the place.

25:01.985 --> 25:03.219
Well, he...
He hasn't arrived?

25:03.253 --> 25:06.322
Mm-mm, no, not yet.
He's still to arrive.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.996
Who does Mr. Grayson love?

25:14.031 --> 25:16.364
Mr. Renfield, who does he love?

25:17.500 --> 25:21.770
Who does
Mr. Alexander Grayson love?

25:23.306 --> 25:26.775
I am willing to offer you
20,000 of your American dollars.

25:26.810 --> 25:28.076
Mr. Grayson,

25:28.110 --> 25:30.712
you are either a very brave man...

25:30.747 --> 25:32.814
or a very foolish one.

25:32.848 --> 25:35.616
This is a rough country
to be traveling unarmed.

25:37.686 --> 25:40.956
This is a singularly inopportune moment
to purchase a mine, sir.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.457
What the hell?

25:42.491 --> 25:45.160
Federal taxes are set to escalate,

25:45.194 --> 25:48.263
so if you insist
on making the purchase,

25:48.297 --> 25:49.564
make sure you tender an option

25:49.598 --> 25:53.233
with a leaseback provision
to avoid the levies.

25:53.268 --> 25:55.169
Whiskey, sir?

25:55.203 --> 25:56.170
Thank you.

25:56.204 --> 25:57.672
They mean to kill you.

25:57.706 --> 25:59.974
Unh!

26:00.008 --> 26:01.442
That's enough outta you.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.978
You think you're so smart? Huh?

26:05.113 --> 26:07.214
Come on, boys! Join in.

26:07.248 --> 26:08.349
Unh!

26:28.002 --> 26:29.469
Aah!

26:49.256 --> 26:52.892
You're safe now.

26:52.926 --> 26:53.959
Mr. Renfield?

26:55.795 --> 26:56.762
Mr. Renfield.

26:58.464 --> 27:01.834
Who does Grayson love?

28:02.764 --> 28:05.364
Curious.
No sign of the ringmaster.

28:05.399 --> 28:07.533
No doubt choreographing
his grand entrance.

28:07.568 --> 28:08.835
I actually meant his man.

28:08.869 --> 28:10.070
You know, the very large one

28:10.104 --> 28:12.271
who makes all
the turgid announcements.

28:12.306 --> 28:14.006
What's his name?

28:14.040 --> 28:17.276
Speaking of grand entrances.

28:19.879 --> 28:22.781
- She's looking for Grayson.
- How can you tell?

28:22.816 --> 28:24.617
Because he's the only one
who isn't here.

28:24.651 --> 28:25.918
Poor thing.

28:25.952 --> 28:28.020
Spent her best years
having any man she pleases,

28:28.054 --> 28:29.622
but now?

28:29.656 --> 28:31.490
Lady Wetherby faces
the unpleasant prospect

28:31.524 --> 28:34.093
of not having the one man
she really wants

28:34.127 --> 28:37.129
while her husband withers away
in his sickbed.

28:57.082 --> 28:59.817
I apologize for being late.

28:59.852 --> 29:01.853
I hope everything
is as you wish, Miss Murray.

29:01.887 --> 29:03.554
Thank you so much,
for everything.

29:03.588 --> 29:05.589
Hmm.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.095
You look very lovely.

29:13.231 --> 29:16.433
You'll have to excuse me, hmm?

29:16.468 --> 29:19.102
- Thank you, incidentally.
- What for?

29:19.137 --> 29:21.539
With your help, we managed
to locate Renfield.

29:21.573 --> 29:23.407
Suffice it to say, all is good,

29:23.441 --> 29:26.410
though I'm no closer
to knowing who's responsible.

29:26.444 --> 29:28.945
- Is he...
- He's quite all right. I assure you.

29:28.980 --> 29:32.849
Now, what's this interesting news
you have regarding General Shaw?

29:32.884 --> 29:34.818
- Quite the party.
- Mm.

29:34.852 --> 29:38.555
He must be
a very valuable employee.

29:45.963 --> 29:47.831
What do you think of Harker?

29:47.865 --> 29:49.066
I think he could be useful.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.000
And if anything, he's ambitious.

29:51.034 --> 29:52.468
Surely you're not thinking
of recruitment.

29:52.503 --> 29:54.237
Well, he's a little rough
around the edges,

29:54.271 --> 29:56.472
but we could always use
some fresh blood.

29:56.507 --> 29:59.075
The more Britain arms itself
for war against the Ottomans,

29:59.109 --> 30:00.510
the more General Shaw
stands to gain.

30:00.544 --> 30:03.379
On virtually every munitions
deal this country makes,

30:03.414 --> 30:05.582
he's getting a cut.

30:05.616 --> 30:08.350
10% of the total value
of the contracts.

30:08.384 --> 30:10.686
Harker, these allegations...

30:10.721 --> 30:12.654
More than allegations.

30:12.689 --> 30:14.456
I've checked his accounts.
They're meticulous.

30:14.490 --> 30:18.594
Look, Harker, my intention
was to embarrass the man,

30:18.628 --> 30:21.931
not have him dragged up
on charges.

30:21.965 --> 30:23.898
But Shaw's a hypocrite.

30:23.933 --> 30:25.367
A traitor of the highest order.

30:25.401 --> 30:28.604
You're not suggesting
I just let this go, are you?

30:28.638 --> 30:29.738
Ah.

30:29.772 --> 30:33.041
Mr. Grayson, and the groom.

30:33.075 --> 30:34.276
Lady Jayne Wetherby.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.211
I invited her.
I hope you don't mind.

30:36.246 --> 30:39.114
Of course not.

30:39.148 --> 30:41.850
Um, if you'll excuse me.

30:41.884 --> 30:45.319
Harker.

30:45.354 --> 30:48.723
I've missed you.

30:51.293 --> 30:54.562
You look absolutely ravishing.

30:55.831 --> 30:59.066
Oh, far better to be ravished.

30:59.100 --> 31:02.069
Where have you been
keeping yourself?

31:02.103 --> 31:05.673
It seems somebody abducted
and tortured my man, Renfield.

31:05.707 --> 31:08.108
Oh, good lord!

31:08.143 --> 31:10.711
Why would someone
do something like that?

31:15.283 --> 31:18.852
Probably some old business rival.

31:18.887 --> 31:20.487
And don't worry.

31:20.521 --> 31:21.855
It's all been resolved.

31:21.890 --> 31:24.158
- Shall we?
- Yes.

31:26.394 --> 31:28.095
Uh, Mr. Grayson?

31:28.129 --> 31:30.297
Please let me introduce you
to my employer.

31:30.331 --> 31:33.132
Uh, Mr. Grayson,
um, Lady Wetherby,

31:33.167 --> 31:34.801
this is Mr. Browning.

31:34.835 --> 31:36.603
- Mr. Browning.
- Mr. Grayson.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.438
- Lord Davenport.
- We've met.

31:38.472 --> 31:39.506
Lord Rothcroft.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.775
- Lord Rothcroft.
- Mr. Grayson.

31:41.809 --> 31:43.976
- And Lord Godalming.
- Lord Godalming.

31:44.011 --> 31:45.144
Welcome to my home.

31:45.179 --> 31:47.646
Very kind of you to have us.

31:49.349 --> 31:51.383
Uh, gentlemen, please excuse us.

31:54.454 --> 31:57.089
I cannot wait
to get you to myself.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.426
Hmm, and so you shall.

32:00.460 --> 32:04.095
Mr. Grayson.

32:22.514 --> 32:24.916
Excuse me, Mr. Grayson?

32:24.951 --> 32:28.586
I would like you to meet
my mentor and my friend,

32:28.620 --> 32:30.755
Professor Van Helsing.

32:30.789 --> 32:33.091
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Professor Van Helsing.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.093
Honored to meet you.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.194
The Professor is a pioneer
in his field.

32:37.229 --> 32:39.864
Is that so?

32:46.372 --> 32:49.774
Grayson's man,
Mr. Renfield, was abducted.

32:49.808 --> 32:51.743
- Really?
- Mm.

32:51.777 --> 32:55.279
Abducted and tortured.
Was that Order business?

32:55.313 --> 32:58.548
Absolutely not.

33:00.685 --> 33:02.353
Mr. Grayson's been
kind enough to give us

33:02.387 --> 33:04.355
his home
for our celebration tonight.

33:04.389 --> 33:06.123
How remarkably generous of him.

33:06.157 --> 33:10.159
Thank you, Professor.
A pleasure.

33:10.194 --> 33:12.195
Miss Murray.

33:28.779 --> 33:30.246
Professor?

33:30.281 --> 33:33.983
Is everything all right?

33:34.018 --> 33:36.019
Excuse me.

33:39.031 --> 33:41.399
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

33:41.433 --> 33:46.069
For my beautiful daughter, Mina,
who has always made me proud,

33:46.104 --> 33:49.705
and for Jonathan, who I have
long considered a son.

33:49.739 --> 33:53.309
Mina, I only wish
your mother were here

33:53.343 --> 33:57.379
to witness the woman
that you've become.

33:57.414 --> 34:01.184
Please, join me in raising
a glass to the happy couple.

34:01.218 --> 34:02.651
To Mina and Jonathan.

34:02.686 --> 34:04.954
To Mina and Jonathan!

34:11.828 --> 34:14.062
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

34:14.096 --> 34:18.400
I'd, um, well, I would like to start
by thanking Dr. Murray,

34:18.435 --> 34:20.768
not just for his kind words
this evening

34:20.804 --> 34:24.572
but for a whole lifetime
of kindness,

34:24.606 --> 34:27.108
culminating in him allowing me
to marry his daughter!

34:29.777 --> 34:32.746
I say "allowing," but, um,
anyone who knows Mina

34:32.781 --> 34:34.983
knows that she follows
her own path,

34:35.016 --> 34:38.786
and that path... that path
has led her to make me

34:38.821 --> 34:41.656
the very happiest
and very luckiest man alive.

34:41.690 --> 34:43.023
Hear, hear.

34:43.058 --> 34:44.492
Mr. Grayson!

34:44.525 --> 34:47.962
Tonight's festivities
are nothing short of spectacular.

34:47.996 --> 34:50.364
Now I've thought long and hard
about how best to express

34:50.399 --> 34:52.199
my gratitude to you,

34:52.234 --> 34:57.036
and in the end, decided that
it's right for me to offer you

34:57.072 --> 35:00.307
what I consider most precious...

35:00.342 --> 35:02.696
The privilege of the first dance.

37:12.370 --> 37:15.472
May I cut in?

37:28.184 --> 37:30.185
Excuse me. I need some air.

37:35.558 --> 37:39.261
Grayson has a secret.
I can tell.

37:39.295 --> 37:41.730
And what might that be?

37:41.764 --> 37:44.466
I'm not entirely sure.

37:44.500 --> 37:47.102
He's a man of mystery
without biography.

37:47.136 --> 37:50.105
Well, that's hardly unusual
for an American.

37:50.139 --> 37:52.507
Those who oppose him
frequently end up dead.

37:52.542 --> 37:55.043
Those that oppose you
frequently end up dead.

37:55.077 --> 37:57.311
It's coincidence. Nothing more.

38:00.249 --> 38:01.415
Speaking of which,

38:01.450 --> 38:03.017
his arrival in London

38:03.052 --> 38:05.553
coincided with something
rather more ominous.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.188
Which is?

38:07.223 --> 38:11.059
The advent of the old one
you seek.

38:11.093 --> 38:13.761
I brought you
the old one's ashes in a jar.

38:13.795 --> 38:16.596
Did you?

38:18.166 --> 38:20.200
Alexander Grayson, a vamp...

38:20.235 --> 38:22.535
Ridiculous. Never.

38:22.570 --> 38:27.440
You would not be the first woman
to be blinded by desire.

38:27.475 --> 38:31.177
The first huntsman, yes...

38:31.211 --> 38:35.181
but not the first woman.

39:01.207 --> 39:04.910
Go away!

39:58.529 --> 40:00.464
A lot of information
I learned here in New York

40:00.498 --> 40:02.098
while I was studying law

40:02.132 --> 40:05.736
under Charles Remick,
a white abolitionist.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.938
He made a motion I be examined
under the Missouri bar.

40:08.973 --> 40:12.608
I presume you passed.

40:12.642 --> 40:14.177
I joined a firm in St. Louis

40:14.211 --> 40:16.746
and was sent out west
to sort out a cross-claim.

40:16.780 --> 40:20.183
The client took exception
to my race.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.385
I was set upon by ruffians,
and imprisoned

40:22.419 --> 40:25.188
for the crime of defending myself.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.723
What about the firm in St. Louis?

40:27.758 --> 40:29.759
Well, they washed
their hands of me.

40:29.793 --> 40:33.796
I suspect that
was their intent all along.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.866
I was left friendless
and penniless.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.968
Suffice to say...

40:40.003 --> 40:44.106
things did not go to plan.

40:52.581 --> 40:56.285
I'm very grateful for this, sir.

40:56.319 --> 41:00.388
I hope I don't undermine
that gratitude by asking, "Why?"

41:00.423 --> 41:03.858
You're a lawyer of
the highest caliber, Renfield.

41:03.893 --> 41:07.261
I require a lawyer.

41:15.070 --> 41:18.172
I too know what it's like
to live as an outcast,

41:18.206 --> 41:22.376
outside what passes
for polite society, but rarely is.

41:24.679 --> 41:28.382
More than you
could possibly imagine.

41:28.417 --> 41:32.920
You are a man of secrets,
Mr. Grayson.

41:32.954 --> 41:35.355
That much, I can see.

41:35.389 --> 41:37.891
But I owe it to my profession
and my good name

41:37.926 --> 41:40.327
to tell you that
I can only work for a man

41:40.361 --> 41:42.663
who trusts me completely.

42:02.816 --> 42:06.352
Then you shall know
all my secrets,

42:06.386 --> 42:10.122
and your life
will never be the same.

42:14.194 --> 42:17.897
Is that a promise?
