00:04.363 --> 00:06.496
Mom, your pearls, really?

00:06.596 --> 00:08.764
Oh, I think
they're nice.

00:08.831 --> 00:09.965
Just try them.

00:10.032 --> 00:11.432
Wow, look at you!

00:11.500 --> 00:14.069
You're so pretty, Sera.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.137
Isn't she, Dad?

00:15.204 --> 00:16.337
Just like her mom.

00:16.405 --> 00:18.206
Oh, stop.

00:18.274 --> 00:19.440
Let me do it.

00:19.508 --> 00:20.708
Ok.

00:20.777 --> 00:21.943
All right, you got it?

00:22.011 --> 00:22.944
Yeah.

00:23.012 --> 00:24.511
All right, here you go.

00:24.579 --> 00:26.881
If this guy touches you,
he's dead.

00:26.948 --> 00:28.482
I'm serious.
Dad.

00:28.549 --> 00:30.717
Just please don't
say that to him.

00:30.786 --> 00:32.351
Stop embarrassing
her, Bruce.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.554
I want to go
to Homecoming.

00:34.622 --> 00:37.091
Soon enough,
little one.

00:38.526 --> 00:41.227
I am not so little.

Oh, God.

00:58.211 --> 01:00.679
Hello?
What's your emergency?

01:00.746 --> 01:03.248
Is anyone there? Hello?

01:03.316 --> 01:04.581
Sir?

01:04.650 --> 01:07.085
They're gone.
My girls are gone.

01:07.153 --> 01:09.221
I need your help.

01:10.489 --> 01:12.924
When you say girls,
do you mean your daughters?

01:12.991 --> 01:14.058
Yes.

01:14.126 --> 01:16.160
All right, I need you
to stay on the line, sir.

01:16.228 --> 01:18.129
Please confirm
where you're calling from.

01:18.197 --> 01:21.365
1721 Hillcrest Drive.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.334
This can't be happening.

01:23.401 --> 01:25.002
What's your name, sir?

01:25.070 --> 01:26.871
Bruce. Bruce Morrison.

01:26.939 --> 01:29.739
How old are your daughters,
Mr. Morrison?

01:29.807 --> 01:31.641
13 and 17.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.844
When was the last time
you saw them?

01:33.911 --> 01:36.880
They went to bed
around 9:30.

01:36.948 --> 01:39.782
No, wait.
It was Monday.

01:39.851 --> 01:43.619
Sera has a study group,
so it was more like 10:00.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.554
Sir, today is Wednesday.

01:45.621 --> 01:48.490
You haven't seen them
since Monday?

01:48.558 --> 01:50.326
No. No, that can't be right.

01:50.393 --> 01:52.394
I'm sorry, sir,
but it is.

01:52.462 --> 01:53.795
Today is Wednesday.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.231
No.

01:55.298 --> 01:57.658
The police have been alerted, sir,
and they're on their way.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.534
That call came in
an hour ago.

01:59.602 --> 02:03.738
How does a single father lose
his teenage daughters for 36 hours?

02:03.805 --> 02:04.805
He doesn't.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.140
His girls are gone.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.142
He doesn't blame anyone.

02:08.210 --> 02:10.078
And he doesn't use
any buzzwords

02:10.145 --> 02:11.585
first responders
are trained to hear.

02:11.646 --> 02:13.547
He never says missing,
abducted, runaway.

02:13.615 --> 02:16.049
Maybe that's what they did, though.
Maybe they ran away.

02:16.117 --> 02:17.951
There's no history of that.

02:18.019 --> 02:19.586
The likelihood of
a stranger abduction

02:19.653 --> 02:21.188
in a neighborhood
like this is rare.

02:21.256 --> 02:24.057
I've counted 7 turns from
the entrance to their driveway.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.625
No one just stumbled
onto the house.

02:25.693 --> 02:26.693
And where's the mother?

02:26.761 --> 02:28.262
Could this be a parental
child abduction?

02:28.329 --> 02:31.931
Uh, doubtful. Exactly one year
ago today he made this call.

02:31.999 --> 02:34.367
911. Please state
your emergency.

02:34.434 --> 02:35.634
My wife is gone.

02:35.702 --> 02:37.937
Confirm where are you
calling from.

02:38.005 --> 02:41.908
1721 Hillcrest Drive.

02:41.975 --> 02:43.842
She'd also been missing
for two days

02:43.911 --> 02:46.578
before he contacted authorities,
and she's never been found.

02:46.646 --> 02:48.747
This man is either the victim
of a serial offender

02:48.815 --> 02:50.048
or he is one.

02:50.116 --> 02:52.284
Please tell me
this guy's in custody.

02:52.351 --> 02:53.852
The Salisbury police
are at his home

02:53.920 --> 02:55.421
and they've been there
since the call came in.

02:55.488 --> 02:57.756
There are hard copies
and tablet copies

02:57.824 --> 03:00.191
of both case files
on the plane.

03:00.259 --> 03:01.860
It's a short flight
to the eastern shore.

03:01.895 --> 03:04.029
There'll be more
when you land.

Anais Nin.

03:58.913 --> 04:02.715
Bruce and Judy Morrison were well
liked and active in the community.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.917
All signs point to them
living a quiet life.

04:04.985 --> 04:06.286
He's a writer
and a Professor,

04:06.353 --> 04:07.887
and it looks like she got into
real estate a few years ago.

04:07.954 --> 04:09.656
'02, before the market
crashed.

04:09.723 --> 04:13.159
Well, 10 years later Judy had
an affair with a co-worker,

04:13.226 --> 04:14.160
a Jeff Godwin?

04:14.227 --> 04:16.461
That was discovered
in the investigation

04:16.529 --> 04:17.995
but never made it
in the papers.

04:18.063 --> 04:19.498
Bruce Morrison
was a prime suspect,

04:19.565 --> 04:20.932
but they never
found any evidence

04:21.000 --> 04:23.067
and the affair wasn't
deemed enough of a motive.

04:23.135 --> 04:24.969
The university's put him
on sabbatical since then.

04:25.037 --> 04:28.106
He's been writing forever, and
he's been teaching since 1985.

04:28.174 --> 04:30.442
Transcript says
he was grief-stricken

04:30.510 --> 04:32.510
and couldn't handle
the pressure.

04:32.577 --> 04:33.844
Not many people could.

04:33.912 --> 04:36.013
The odds of this event
striking the same family

04:36.080 --> 04:38.449
on the same day
must be a billion to one.

04:38.517 --> 04:39.583
Close enough.

04:39.651 --> 04:41.285
Judy inherited money
from her family

04:41.353 --> 04:43.153
and it's in a trust
for the girls.

04:43.221 --> 04:46.223
Ah, jeez, please tell me he did not
get rid of his wife for money.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.991
Bank records indicate
he hasn't touched the funds,

04:48.059 --> 04:50.527
despite the depleting supplemental
income from the university.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.261
Yeah, but it could be
a combo platter.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.130
Revenge and profit.

04:54.198 --> 04:55.932
His wife cheated
and he retaliated in anger.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.867
That might not be a surprise,
but that doesn't explain

04:57.935 --> 05:00.236
why he would harm
his own children.

05:07.777 --> 05:10.278
The oldest daughter Sera
had a 4.0 GPA,

05:10.347 --> 05:12.781
but she didn't apply
to a single college back east.

05:12.849 --> 05:14.616
She accepted a Stanford
early admission.

05:14.684 --> 05:18.186
Maybe her father saw going
that far away as a form of betrayal.

05:18.254 --> 05:20.355
The second one in a year.

05:20.422 --> 05:23.023
First his wife of 27 years
fools around

05:23.091 --> 05:25.259
and then probably threatens
to end the marriage.

05:25.327 --> 05:27.795
A year later, the daughter
can't wait to leave.

05:27.863 --> 05:30.130
Abandonment could be
the common denominator.

05:30.198 --> 05:31.599
There is another
possibility.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.668
Maybe Bruce Morrison
didn't do it.

05:33.736 --> 05:35.135
The family have
any enemies?

05:35.203 --> 05:37.871
The only person that might
fit that would be Jeff Godwin.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.673
Mm, looks like he had
a pretty solid alibi

05:39.741 --> 05:41.174
the night Judy went missing.

05:41.242 --> 05:42.843
He was wining and dining
his own wife

05:42.910 --> 05:44.544
at a local restaurant.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.880
So the only viable suspect
back then

05:46.947 --> 05:49.182
was the same one we have now.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.252
All the answers
are in that house.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.767
Marty Friedman.
Thanks for making the trip.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.567
We got search and rescue
combing the woods

06:09.635 --> 06:11.536
and the Choptank
and Wicomico rivers.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.372
We're dredging all the way
from here to the Chesapeake.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.941
I'm not letting this guy
get away with it again.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.943
Has he said why he took
a day to call?

06:19.011 --> 06:21.345
Claims he doesn't remember.

06:22.681 --> 06:24.715
He's been glued
to his computer.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.617
Maybe he needs new
material for a novel.

06:26.684 --> 06:29.720
We'll work alongside your team
if that's all right.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.855
Whatever you need.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.532
Everybody take a room.

06:42.599 --> 06:45.334
Mr. Morrison,
I'm Aaron Hotchner from the FBI.

06:45.402 --> 06:48.604
My team's here to help gather
information to find your children.

06:48.672 --> 06:49.677
I'm glad you're here.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.230
But shouldn't you be out
there looking for my girls?

06:52.776 --> 06:54.744
We have to start where
they were last seen.

06:54.812 --> 06:56.511
I know you think
I did this.

06:56.579 --> 06:57.646
They all do.

06:57.713 --> 06:58.847
Sir, we're not here
to accuse you.

06:58.915 --> 07:00.014
We want to find
your daughters.

07:00.082 --> 07:02.016
Well, so do I.

07:02.084 --> 07:03.685
So if someone calls
with a ransom demand,

07:03.753 --> 07:05.487
do you have the means
to trace the call?

07:05.555 --> 07:07.355
No one's calling.

07:10.693 --> 07:13.327
We'll have our analyst set up
what we call a trap and trace

07:13.394 --> 07:14.662
back at Quantico.
Thanks.

07:14.729 --> 07:16.396
I'm told you have
Sera's phone.

07:16.465 --> 07:17.765
It's on the dining room
table.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.032
And Katie's phone?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.936
I looked for it in her room.
I couldn't find it.

07:22.003 --> 07:23.671
I've made some flyers.

07:23.738 --> 07:25.973
Detective, would it be possible
for one of your officers

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
to help get them out?

07:27.108 --> 07:29.642
That's a good idea.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.644
It looks like Katie
stayed in a lot.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.747
She has a schedule of when
she was gonna try new recipes.

07:34.815 --> 07:37.083
She seems like
a really sweet girl.

07:37.150 --> 07:39.552
Her charger's here
but the phone is not.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.087
Maybe it's with her?

07:41.154 --> 07:42.722
Yeah, I'll have Garcia
track it.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.151
It'll only work
if it's on, though.

07:44.191 --> 07:45.491
It's worth a try.

07:45.558 --> 07:47.158
If the girls had access
to a phone and they were okay,

07:47.226 --> 07:48.861
they would have called
for help by now.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.835
Nothing in the past year
since her mom disappeared.

07:56.903 --> 07:58.336
It looks like she kept it
all bottled up.

07:58.404 --> 08:00.705
Except when she was
assigned to write.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.807
There's a lot of papers in here
from her creative writing class.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.942
Her dad's a writer
and English Professor.

08:05.010 --> 08:08.713
Maybe she was trying
to get his attention.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.416
What is it?

08:12.484 --> 08:15.185
Are most high school
seniors this neat?

08:15.253 --> 08:18.321
Trash is empty.
Bed's perfectly made.

08:18.389 --> 08:19.890
Mm-hmm.

08:22.426 --> 08:24.628
So is that what he did
for two days,

08:24.695 --> 08:26.362
clean the house?

08:27.364 --> 08:28.632
We let the housekeeper go

08:28.699 --> 08:31.501
when I was forced
to take a sabbatical last year.

08:31.569 --> 08:33.301
Are you angry about that?

08:33.369 --> 08:36.871
Angry? I don't have
the energy for that anymore.

08:36.940 --> 08:39.241
How are you keeping up
with everything?

08:39.308 --> 08:41.476
The girls and I
do the best we can.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.078
Judy liked an orderly house,

08:43.145 --> 08:46.148
and I keep hoping that she'll
walk back through that door.

08:48.584 --> 08:52.186
You just did laundry
but only your clothes.

08:52.254 --> 08:53.821
I was wondering,
did you do that

08:53.889 --> 08:56.824
before or after
you called 911?

08:56.892 --> 08:59.160
I did it when I woke up
in the morning,

08:59.227 --> 09:02.263
before I knew
the girls were missing.

09:02.330 --> 09:04.131
Mr. Morrison, you understand
that we can only help you

09:04.199 --> 09:07.434
if you tell us
everything that happened.

09:07.501 --> 09:10.503
Katie was asleep
when Sera came home late.

09:10.572 --> 09:12.573
She said that she drove slow
because of the rain.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.608
That's all I remember.

09:14.676 --> 09:16.577
Oh, and I was watching
basketball.

09:16.644 --> 09:18.111
And then?

09:19.513 --> 09:22.014
I went to bed, I guess.

09:25.118 --> 09:28.120
It's happened before.

09:28.188 --> 09:32.792
I can't explain it, but the next
thing I know, it's morning.

09:32.859 --> 09:35.928
And I could feel
that something was wrong.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.914
Sera, you're late!

09:57.916 --> 10:02.419
Katie, Sera,
your alarm's going off.

10:02.487 --> 10:05.122
Did you oversleep?

10:10.327 --> 10:13.062
Girls!

10:15.332 --> 10:16.799
Girls!

10:16.867 --> 10:18.501
Sera.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.840
Girls?

10:27.744 --> 10:29.077
Katie?

10:32.348 --> 10:33.849
Girls!

10:33.916 --> 10:35.416
Katie! Sera!

10:44.459 --> 10:45.893
911. What's your emergency?

10:45.961 --> 10:47.427
Oh, my God.

10:47.495 --> 10:49.864
Hello?
What's your emergency?

10:49.931 --> 10:52.867
Is anyone there? Hello? Sir?

10:52.934 --> 10:54.935
They're gone.
My girls are gone.

10:55.003 --> 10:57.070
I need your help.

11:00.307 --> 11:03.476
I just--I can't stand here
and do nothing.

11:03.544 --> 11:05.545
I have Judy's sister
coming in.

11:05.612 --> 11:07.047
We have to find the girls.

11:07.114 --> 11:09.415
How much longer do you
need to be standing here.

11:09.483 --> 11:10.984
Shouldn't we be
out there looking?

11:24.564 --> 11:26.832
Hello.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.167
Hi, Karen.

11:29.234 --> 11:31.302
No, nothing yet.

11:35.774 --> 11:37.274
All right, thanks.

11:37.342 --> 11:40.544
So, he does own
a 12-gauge shotgun.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.046
The police catalogued it
a year ago.

11:42.114 --> 11:44.548
But ballistics proved that
it hadn't been fired in years.

11:44.616 --> 11:45.849
Where is it now?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.617
He claims he doesn't know,
but I'm not finished.

11:47.685 --> 11:50.587
He also bought a used .38
just after Judy's disappearance,

11:50.654 --> 11:52.089
and now he claims he doesn't know
where that is either.

11:52.156 --> 11:53.489
Well, if he used it,
it might explain

11:53.557 --> 11:55.592
why he threw his clothes
in the wash this morning.

11:55.659 --> 11:57.694
So the clothes
would be compromised.

11:57.762 --> 11:59.196
He did sleep in here, though.

11:59.263 --> 12:01.424
We should have these sheets
tested for gunshot residue.

12:01.431 --> 12:03.699
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me.

12:03.767 --> 12:06.135
Will you bag
the sheets, please?

12:06.203 --> 12:08.137
There's some muddy boots
by the back door.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.471
We should test those, too.

12:09.539 --> 12:11.640
Well, it appears he still
sleeps on his side of the bed.

12:11.708 --> 12:12.808
Look at that.

12:12.876 --> 12:15.444
His wife's things
haven't been cleaned out.

12:19.081 --> 12:21.983
Maybe he really
is in mourning.

12:22.051 --> 12:24.119
Our analyst is checking
phone logs.

12:24.186 --> 12:25.253
We did the same last year,

12:25.320 --> 12:27.055
but it's like Judy Morrison
just vanished.

12:27.123 --> 12:29.157
I couldn't even find her
phone or appointment book

12:29.225 --> 12:30.925
to see who her last
meetings were with.

12:30.993 --> 12:32.860
Take a look at this.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.631
When does recycling
get picked up?

12:37.698 --> 12:38.966
Monday mornings.

12:39.033 --> 12:40.868
So these are new.

12:40.935 --> 12:42.335
Last year he said
he was in recovery

12:42.336 --> 12:44.371
but had fallen off the wagon
because of Judy's affair.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.240
He hasn't mentioned
this at all.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.468
I always thought he was drinking
more than he admitted.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.877
Wondered if he was
popping pills, too,

12:50.944 --> 12:52.444
but we could never find
any evidence.

12:52.512 --> 12:54.781
Well, let's go ask him.

12:56.383 --> 12:58.484
Mr. Morrison,

12:58.551 --> 13:01.287
did the girls leave often
without you knowing?

13:01.354 --> 13:04.690
No. Look, I've told you
everything.

13:04.758 --> 13:07.926
I gotta ask you, are two bottles
of bourbon a normal Monday night?

13:07.994 --> 13:09.761
It wasn't really two.

13:09.829 --> 13:13.331
There was only a little bit
left in the first one.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.701
It was a rough day.

13:16.769 --> 13:20.038
Monday was the year anniversary
of when Judy went missing.

13:20.106 --> 13:21.738
You think
we don't know that?

13:21.807 --> 13:22.957
There haven't been
many days this year

13:22.958 --> 13:25.478
when I haven't been very aware
of your wife having gone missing.

13:25.682 --> 13:26.748
What happened Monday?

13:26.773 --> 13:28.508
Did it all come rushing back
and you just snapped?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.175
No. I was sad
and I drank too much

13:31.243 --> 13:34.145
because I miss my wife.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.681
Honestly,
bourbon doesn't help much.

13:37.749 --> 13:40.751
It helped you lose an entire day
from what I can tell.

13:42.053 --> 13:43.888
Why don't we head upstairs.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.794
Detective.

13:50.862 --> 13:52.629
Look, I understand
that you're frustrated,

13:52.696 --> 13:55.464
but you're not helping
yourself taking it out on him.

13:55.533 --> 13:56.933
I thought this guy
was dirty a year ago,

13:57.001 --> 13:59.435
and now it's happened again.

13:59.503 --> 14:01.403
There are no bodies,
no evidence,

14:01.470 --> 14:04.973
no nothing but my gut
and 25 years of police work.

14:11.614 --> 14:12.714
Hey, baby girl.

14:12.782 --> 14:13.815
Have you found them yet?

14:13.883 --> 14:15.183
I'm about to join
the search.

14:15.251 --> 14:17.418
Good. Okay. I don't know
the location of Katie's cell,

14:17.485 --> 14:19.654
which means the battery's dead,
but I pulled phone records

14:19.721 --> 14:22.557
for both the girls,
and holy cannoli,

14:22.624 --> 14:25.693
they text more than I do.
More Sera than Katie, but still...

14:25.761 --> 14:26.928
Anything suspicious?

14:26.995 --> 14:29.597
It looks like just friendly,
rapid-fire repeat numbers,

14:29.665 --> 14:30.932
probably all known contacts.

14:30.999 --> 14:33.733
Uh, last activity
was Monday at 9:55 p.m.

14:33.801 --> 14:35.162
Well, that matches
the dad's story.

14:35.169 --> 14:37.403
I'm wading through
the most used numbers first.

14:37.471 --> 14:39.111
I will hit you back when
I know who's who.

14:39.173 --> 14:41.741
I'm hanging up hard,
like the strength of my love.

14:44.411 --> 14:45.946
Wow.

14:46.013 --> 14:49.181
She had a lot of hobbies before
she started selling real estate.

14:49.248 --> 14:50.683
Yeah, family projects.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.317
Devoted mom.

14:54.253 --> 14:55.754
You ready, Reid?

14:55.822 --> 14:57.623
Yeah.

15:03.597 --> 15:05.597
Excuse me.

15:05.664 --> 15:08.466
Do you mind if I ask you
a question.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.934
He killed them,
too, did he?

15:10.002 --> 15:11.335
Sorry?

15:11.403 --> 15:12.870
Did that son of a bitch
hurt his daughters?

15:12.938 --> 15:14.378
Sir, how well
do you know the family?

15:14.439 --> 15:16.474
They moved in
when we did.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.643
My wife always liked
his wife.

15:18.711 --> 15:19.944
And you and Mr. Morrison?

15:20.012 --> 15:22.312
Got nothing in common
with that drunk.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.581
Told me he was gonna
shoot my dog.

15:24.649 --> 15:27.751
I used to let my girls, you know,
roam around the yard here.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.220
They'd bark occasionally,
but never too long.

15:30.287 --> 15:31.848
And then one night
that idiot comes out,

15:31.889 --> 15:32.990
hammered,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.025
and he tells me
that he can't work

15:35.093 --> 15:36.859
because
my dog's yapping.

15:36.927 --> 15:38.327
And then he says
he wouldn't be surprised

15:38.394 --> 15:40.162
if one of them
was found dead.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.497
The man is nuts.

15:41.564 --> 15:42.999
The Morrison girls
were last seen Monday night.

15:43.066 --> 15:44.433
Did you see them at all?

15:44.501 --> 15:48.604
No. But Morrison sounded
drunk and belligerent again.

15:48.672 --> 15:51.674
It was about 10:00.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.642
He didn't tell you that,
did he?

15:53.709 --> 15:54.776
Were both cars home?

15:54.844 --> 15:56.845
Well, I'm not spying
on the guy or anything,

15:56.912 --> 15:58.346
but we were out here
a little later.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.615
I noticed his car was gone.

16:00.683 --> 16:03.051
Then when I turned
"Letterman" off,

16:03.119 --> 16:05.219
it was back.

16:06.421 --> 16:09.556
Why did you stop
going to your meetings?

16:09.624 --> 16:12.359
I was two years sober.

16:12.426 --> 16:14.962
Then Judy has this affair.

16:15.030 --> 16:18.999
I guess I needed something,
so I started drinking again.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.734
What would you do?

16:22.537 --> 16:25.672
Your daughters testified that
you and Judy had had a fight

16:25.739 --> 16:26.605
the night that she disappeared.

16:26.674 --> 16:27.974
That's right. So?

16:28.042 --> 16:30.176
And a neighbor heard an argument
here on Monday night.

16:30.243 --> 16:31.477
Who told you that,
Chip Gordon?

16:31.545 --> 16:33.379
He's a lonely old man.

16:33.446 --> 16:35.982
And since when is having
an argument with teenagers

16:36.050 --> 16:38.051
against the law?
It doesn't mean I hurt them.

16:38.118 --> 16:39.052
Did you?

16:39.119 --> 16:40.653
No!

16:44.557 --> 16:46.892
Yeah, Morgan,
what do you got?

16:46.959 --> 16:49.494
How much does the alcohol abuse
account for the time lost?

16:49.562 --> 16:50.595
I don't know.

16:50.663 --> 16:53.498
It doesn't mean
that I hurt my daughters.

16:53.566 --> 16:54.933
Where are Katie and Sera?

16:55.001 --> 16:56.367
I don't know!

16:56.435 --> 16:57.802
Hotch.

17:10.515 --> 17:11.749
Hey!

17:11.817 --> 17:13.648
Sera could be close!

17:13.718 --> 17:16.586
I want teams working
a 5-mile radius!

17:16.653 --> 17:18.088
Keep working upstream!

17:18.155 --> 17:20.388
Get those dogs working!

17:20.457 --> 17:22.592
5 miles down!

17:22.659 --> 17:25.361
We found Katie's body
in the reeds.

17:25.429 --> 17:27.097
It's near, uh...

17:28.298 --> 17:31.299
I don't really know
which river this is, Hotch.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.267
Katie, Katie...

18:08.335 --> 18:09.635
So what do you think?

18:09.702 --> 18:10.636
I don't know.

18:10.703 --> 18:13.405
He's sober,
so this is raw emotion.

18:13.472 --> 18:15.373
He lost his legs
when Hotch told him.

18:15.441 --> 18:18.243
The tears could be guilt
as much as grief.

18:18.311 --> 18:20.711
Because that's what
we're supposed to do

18:20.779 --> 18:22.147
when given that news.

18:22.214 --> 18:23.415
I don't mean
to sound so cynical,

18:23.482 --> 18:25.083
but the man writes fiction.

18:25.151 --> 18:27.117
Any sign of Sera?

18:27.185 --> 18:28.718
Maybe she's still
out there.

18:28.786 --> 18:30.654
Doubtful, unless
she's found shelter.

18:30.721 --> 18:32.356
It's supposed to be
in the 20s tonight.

18:32.424 --> 18:34.058
Now that we've got
Katie's body,

18:34.125 --> 18:35.116
we should run scenarios

18:35.141 --> 18:36.899
for what really happened
on Monday night.

18:36.901 --> 18:39.470
That was the lab. Bruce
definitely fired a gun at some point.

18:39.537 --> 18:42.171
There's residue on the sheets
and on the boots.

18:42.239 --> 18:44.873
We need to get him
to the station.

18:49.613 --> 18:52.481
Biotic decomposition
is slower in the winter months,

18:52.548 --> 18:54.316
and since her body wasn't
immersed in the river,

18:54.383 --> 18:55.775
it wasn't deteriorated,

18:55.800 --> 18:57.842
so I can tell you a little
more than I thought.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.058
Sorry.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.159
I knew Katie.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.662
She and my daughter
were in class together.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.263
We're sorry.

19:09.331 --> 19:11.099
Me, too.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.535
She was killed between
24 and 48 hours ago.

19:15.603 --> 19:18.972
C.O.D. is blunt force trauma
to the squama of the occipital bone.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.206
Like from the butt
of a gun?

19:20.274 --> 19:21.608
That's possible.

19:21.676 --> 19:23.977
So she was found near the
river but she didn't drown?

19:24.045 --> 19:25.112
No fluid in her lungs.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.647
The water was only
a method of disposal.

19:26.714 --> 19:29.582
Her nails have traces of
skin packed under them.

19:29.651 --> 19:32.952
So we need to look for
defensive wounds on her father.

19:43.496 --> 19:45.597
Mr. Morrison, I need to ask you
to roll up your sleeves.

19:45.666 --> 19:46.598
What?

19:46.666 --> 19:48.199
Please.

19:54.674 --> 19:58.442
I saw these in the shower
this morning when I woke up.

19:58.510 --> 20:01.046
I have no idea
how I got them.

20:01.113 --> 20:02.580
Did they happen
during the fight?

20:02.648 --> 20:05.415
It wasn't a fight.
It was just parenting.

20:05.483 --> 20:08.218
Did the detective tell you
about Jeff Godwin?

20:08.286 --> 20:10.020
You should talk to him.

20:10.088 --> 20:11.488
He still coaches
Sera's soccer team,

20:11.522 --> 20:12.990
even though it's ridiculous.

20:13.058 --> 20:14.725
Every time I ask you
a question,

20:14.793 --> 20:18.728
you have this habit of deflecting
attention onto someone else.

20:21.364 --> 20:23.900
All of her latest writing
assignments are very dark.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.935
Yeah, I saw those, too. I'm sure
it's part of her mom's absence.

20:27.003 --> 20:28.837
Well, she's had her fair share
of suffering.

20:28.905 --> 20:30.072
All right, so you think
she's alive.

20:30.139 --> 20:31.674
Yeah, I have to.

20:31.741 --> 20:36.345
If losing her mother
didn't change everything...

20:36.413 --> 20:39.582
I know losing her sister
certainly will.

20:45.321 --> 20:48.656
I didn't know.

20:48.724 --> 20:51.759
How old were you
when your sister died?

20:53.161 --> 20:54.762
11.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.664
She was 17.

20:59.767 --> 21:00.767
Go ahead, Garcia.

21:00.835 --> 21:02.703
I think I may have found
something creepy.

21:02.770 --> 21:04.938
There's a bunch of text
messages between Sera

21:05.005 --> 21:07.073
and a number that I have
traced back to Jeff Godwin.

21:07.141 --> 21:10.711
Why would your missing
mother's ex-lover stay in touch?

21:10.778 --> 21:12.058
More than a little
inappropriate.

21:12.079 --> 21:14.080
And here's a text
from J.G.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.381
Please tell me
there was nothing strange

21:15.449 --> 21:16.929
going on between him
and the daughter.

21:16.983 --> 21:18.917
It seems more fatherly.
Listen to this.

21:18.985 --> 21:21.387
"It's gonna be okay.
You just have to stay strong.

21:21.455 --> 21:24.022
Is he encouraging her
to leave?

21:24.090 --> 21:25.891
Or for her to face
her father in some way?

21:25.959 --> 21:27.326
Well, what about
the texts on Monday?

21:27.394 --> 21:28.694
There aren't any.

21:28.762 --> 21:30.162
The latest were from
Sunday night.

21:30.230 --> 21:32.297
No, no, no, yes, there are.
I'm looking at the phone records.

21:32.365 --> 21:36.635
There's texts between them
on Monday between 5:23 and 5:56 p.m.

21:38.804 --> 21:39.804
Weird.

21:39.872 --> 21:42.073
Yeah.

21:42.141 --> 21:43.341
Hey, Blake.

21:43.409 --> 21:45.710
Morgan we need you
to find Jeff Godwin.

21:45.778 --> 21:47.177
Uh, he just walked in.

21:47.245 --> 21:49.246
He did?

21:49.314 --> 21:51.214
Says he heard we found Katie
and he's worried about Sera.

21:51.283 --> 21:53.517
He also texted Sera
the night she went missing

21:53.585 --> 21:55.185
and then deleted the texts.

21:55.253 --> 21:57.554
It looks like
they texted a lot.

21:57.622 --> 21:58.789
Really?

22:01.493 --> 22:04.594
Mr. Godwin, why did you
feel it was appropriate

22:04.662 --> 22:06.663
to regularly text
a 17-year-old girl?

22:06.730 --> 22:08.431
I've know those girls
for a long time,

22:08.499 --> 22:10.533
way before anything happened
between me and their mother.

22:10.601 --> 22:12.201
Look, I coach Sera.

22:12.269 --> 22:14.937
You didn't think to request a different
team, given the circumstances?

22:15.005 --> 22:18.040
No. My daughter
plays on the team.

22:18.108 --> 22:21.543
Look, Sera reached out to me
Monday night.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.545
God knows she needs
a father figure.

22:23.613 --> 22:26.581
Maybe the man her mother
had an affair with.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.583
Might not be the best
person to offer that.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.687
Look, I just came in here
because I heard about Katie

22:31.754 --> 22:34.455
and I was worried about Sera.
Don't treat me like a criminal.

22:34.523 --> 22:36.390
Sera deleted texts
that the two of you shared

22:36.458 --> 22:37.925
the same day
she disappeared.

22:37.992 --> 22:40.594
Hey, wait, okay.
They're all here.

22:40.662 --> 22:43.063
We agreed to meet
in the parking lot

22:43.131 --> 22:44.799
of a convenience store
on Route 113.

22:44.866 --> 22:46.099
Read them. Go ahead.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.735
Is this a regular thing
for you?

22:47.803 --> 22:49.069
Well, we've met there
a couple times recently,

22:49.137 --> 22:50.403
when she was really scared

22:50.471 --> 22:51.904
about what was happening
with her and her dad.

22:51.972 --> 22:55.074
What was happening?

22:55.142 --> 22:56.776
Bruce gets really violent
when he drinks,

22:56.844 --> 22:58.712
and it's been getting worse.

22:58.779 --> 23:02.081
Sera had every reason
to be terrified.

23:02.149 --> 23:03.983
I mean, look what happened.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.152
Is everyone there?

23:07.220 --> 23:09.388
Um, this call came in
on Monday.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.491
It was made on Katie's
cell, which is still MIA.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.993
The only 800 number she called
was to a local abuse hotline.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.429
She called there a few times
in the last couple of months.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.165
My name is Katie Morrison.
I called last week.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.767
Yes, Katie, I remember you.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.502
He's at it again.
He's just going crazy.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.103
He's really drunk.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.805
Katie, are you safe?

23:27.873 --> 23:29.039
Yes. Hold on.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.876
Hi, it's Sera. We're okay.
I can handle this.

23:31.943 --> 23:32.910
Who are they taking to?

23:32.978 --> 23:35.546
Girls, open the door!

23:35.614 --> 23:37.314
I don't understand.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.750
Katie, open the door.

23:41.051 --> 23:42.552
Just stop now!

23:42.620 --> 23:44.153
I said open the door!

23:54.765 --> 23:56.399
It's a lay-up.

23:56.466 --> 23:58.467
Off the rim...

24:00.804 --> 24:04.373
Have you even talked
to Katie today?

24:06.075 --> 24:08.644
Shh...
Are you serious, Dad?

24:08.712 --> 24:10.379
You are such
a pathetic father.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.915
Get out of my way!

24:22.925 --> 24:25.727
Girls, open the door!

24:27.261 --> 24:28.862
Katie?

24:28.930 --> 24:31.498
Open the door.

24:31.566 --> 24:32.900
I said open the door!

24:34.769 --> 24:38.572
I said open the door!

24:50.617 --> 24:53.252
Oh, my God.

24:53.320 --> 24:57.590
What a pathetic little crybaby.

24:57.658 --> 25:02.327
Ugh. I was always right
about you, huh?

25:07.767 --> 25:10.234
So you got old Brucie
in a cage, huh?

25:10.302 --> 25:13.472
You think
that's gonna help?

25:13.539 --> 25:17.107
It's only gonna make him
hide longer.

25:17.175 --> 25:19.409
What do you want to know?

25:19.478 --> 25:24.682
I'm gonna have to tell you
'cause the baby's got his pacifier.

25:24.749 --> 25:27.351
Where's Sera?

25:27.418 --> 25:30.220
She's learning a lesson.

25:30.288 --> 25:31.721
What did you do to them?

25:31.789 --> 25:34.223
What did you do to them?

25:36.794 --> 25:39.061
I scared them, that's all.
They needed it.

25:39.129 --> 25:40.797
Why?

25:40.865 --> 25:44.133
Because they're spoiled,
ungrateful little bitches

25:44.201 --> 25:47.569
who walk all over him
any chance they get.

25:47.637 --> 25:49.738
What happened to Bruce?

25:49.806 --> 25:52.774
He's hiding, of course.

25:52.842 --> 25:56.144
See...

25:56.212 --> 26:00.749
When he can't handle it,
I save his ass.

26:00.817 --> 26:03.017
Bruce's problem is,

26:03.084 --> 26:06.654
he can't handle anything.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.134
He could be a psychopath,
but dual personality?

26:18.234 --> 26:20.384
If that's true, where
was that guy a year ago?

26:20.895 --> 26:22.428
These conditions have triggers.

26:22.496 --> 26:25.866
His accelerated drinking
could have agitated it.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.373
With all due respect,
I don't buy it.

26:27.401 --> 26:29.001
The guys knows
he's dead meat

26:29.069 --> 26:31.603
and this is an easy way
to cop an insanity plea.

26:31.672 --> 26:33.839
I hear you, but we need to see
if he's got markers

26:33.907 --> 26:35.440
for a dissociative
identity disorder.

26:35.508 --> 26:38.443
You do what you need
to do. I think it's a waste of time.

26:38.511 --> 26:41.246
So Bruce said Katie
baked cookies Monday night.

26:41.314 --> 26:44.248
We found them in the
kitchen, so that's true.

26:44.316 --> 26:45.684
And two of Sera's
friends confirmed

26:45.751 --> 26:47.251
she never made it
to her study group.

26:47.319 --> 26:49.020
That's because Jeff Godwin
was in the parking lot

26:49.088 --> 26:50.955
with her from 8:15 to 9:30.

26:51.023 --> 26:53.124
And the girls called
the hotline at 9:58.

26:53.192 --> 26:55.326
Detective, have your officers
found either gun?

26:55.394 --> 26:58.596
No, but we've increased the search,
given where Katie's body was found.

26:58.664 --> 27:01.065
We've got residue, but we don't
know which gun or where it is now.

27:01.132 --> 27:02.532
Look, whoever
that was in there

27:02.600 --> 27:05.169
said he wanted to scare them,
not hurt them.

27:05.236 --> 27:07.537
Katie was beaten over the head
in the middle of nowhere.

27:07.605 --> 27:09.807
You're right. The alter
could have lost his temper,

27:09.874 --> 27:11.809
or it could have just been
a horrible accident.

27:11.876 --> 27:14.311
But getting the girls
out of the house was planned.

27:14.378 --> 27:16.979
He said he wanted to scare them
and had a gun to do it.

27:17.047 --> 27:18.347
And then he drove them
somewhere.

27:18.415 --> 27:20.482
Bruce's car had the same mud
on the driver's side floor

27:20.550 --> 27:23.030
that he had on his boots,
but there wasn't any in the backseat.

27:23.053 --> 27:25.354
So 3 people drove somewhere,
but only he came back.

27:25.422 --> 27:26.988
And the DNA coming back
from Katie's nails

27:27.056 --> 27:28.490
will tell us
what we already know--

27:28.558 --> 27:31.327
that Bruce Morrison did this.
So can I arrest him now?

27:31.394 --> 27:33.128
Detective, you have sufficient
evidence to make the arrest,

27:33.196 --> 27:34.996
but we still
don't have Sera.

27:35.064 --> 27:38.066
Give us an hour and maybe
he'll tell us where she is.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.301
It's your call,
but he could still help us.

27:40.369 --> 27:43.605
Ok. One hour.

28:01.589 --> 28:04.358
What happened?

28:04.425 --> 28:06.426
What do you remember?

28:09.797 --> 28:13.599
You played me some tape
of the girls, and then I don't know.

28:13.667 --> 28:16.736
When did your
blackouts start?

28:19.506 --> 28:21.039
In grad school.

28:21.107 --> 28:23.842
There was a lot of pressure
and I'd drink.

28:23.910 --> 28:29.281
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

28:32.285 --> 28:35.186
I couldn't do that.

28:35.254 --> 28:37.922
Please tell me
I didn't do that.

28:37.990 --> 28:40.759
There's no way for us
to confirm a D.I.D. diagnosis yet,

28:40.826 --> 28:43.227
but we do know that he has
chronic alcoholism,

28:43.295 --> 28:45.296
which can and has gone
hand in hand with it.

28:45.363 --> 28:46.730
The interesting thing is,
his liver and pancreas

28:46.798 --> 28:48.432
wouldn't have survived
30 years of that kind of abuse,

28:48.500 --> 28:50.580
so there must have been years
where he's gotten help.

28:50.635 --> 28:52.068
He was in a program.

28:52.136 --> 28:54.037
It would have to be
more than that. Garcia,

28:54.105 --> 28:56.440
has he ever been on medication
to help curb his drinking?

28:56.508 --> 28:58.975
All I've got is a yearly
physical and that is it.

28:59.043 --> 29:02.044
D.I.D. usually stems
from a history of sexual abuse.

29:02.112 --> 29:03.913
Okay, well, I've got nothing
like that.

29:03.980 --> 29:05.948
All I have no Bruce Morrison is that
his mother died when he was 10...

29:06.016 --> 29:08.117
There's your
abandonment issue.

29:08.185 --> 29:10.052
And he was raised by a single
alcoholic father,

29:10.120 --> 29:11.621
and there's no evidence
of any prescriptions.

29:11.689 --> 29:13.489
They look like
the perfect family,

29:13.557 --> 29:15.857
but she would have had to know
about his drinking when they got married.

29:15.925 --> 29:18.293
So you're saying
she helped manage him

29:18.361 --> 29:19.795
and kept his problem a secret.

29:19.862 --> 29:21.296
Maybe she was the one
that got the prescription.

29:21.364 --> 29:23.732
Garcia, can you run
her medical history?

29:23.800 --> 29:25.634
Yeah. Hold on...

29:27.503 --> 29:29.304
Okay. Disulfiram.

29:29.372 --> 29:31.412
Am I saying that right?
It's for chronic alcoholism.

29:31.473 --> 29:33.108
She had a 90-day supply
delivered 4 times a year

29:33.133 --> 29:34.709
for as long as I can tell.

29:34.710 --> 29:36.811
And it stopped coming
a few months ago.

29:36.878 --> 29:39.547
It makes you just feel nauseous
if you drink alcohol.

29:39.614 --> 29:41.649
But she isn't the one who had
a drinking problem. He is.

29:41.717 --> 29:42.916
Garcia, who canceled it?

29:42.984 --> 29:45.152
Please hold while I dig.

29:45.220 --> 29:46.754
Could that be the trigger?

29:46.822 --> 29:51.558
He goes after his daughters
now that he's off his meds?

29:58.332 --> 30:01.434
That instability
could work for us.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.638
Hey, I--I didn't--

30:06.706 --> 30:08.374
hey, I didn't agree to this.

30:08.441 --> 30:09.575
Well, we're looking
for Sera,

30:09.642 --> 30:11.343
and you're the last ones
to see her alive.

30:11.411 --> 30:12.651
Look, like I told
your guy here,

30:12.712 --> 30:15.781
I had nothing to do with this.
And Sera's afraid of him.

30:15.849 --> 30:19.384
Do you want to tell us
about your relationship with Sera?

30:19.451 --> 30:22.353
I don't have one.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.856
Well, that's strange.

30:24.923 --> 30:28.292
Why do you text her
all the time, then?

30:28.360 --> 30:32.096
Jeff, it's not
that big of a leap.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.199
You couldn't have Judy
anymore, so you thought...

30:35.267 --> 30:38.869
Why not? Sera looks
just like her mom.

30:38.936 --> 30:41.337
Stop! Back up! Back up!

30:41.406 --> 30:43.707
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

30:43.775 --> 30:45.542
Get him out!
Get him out now.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.844
Easy!

30:56.953 --> 31:00.689
Judy was gonna leave my boy
for that scumbag.

31:01.925 --> 31:03.559
What's your name?

31:03.627 --> 31:05.027
What's your name?

31:05.094 --> 31:07.162
I'm Jennifer.

31:07.230 --> 31:08.730
Your turn.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.901
My name is Johnny and I
need a cigarette, Jennifer.

31:12.968 --> 31:15.970
Well, I might be able
to help you out there.

31:16.038 --> 31:17.371
I'm sure you're stressed.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.206
Oh, I'm not.

31:19.274 --> 31:20.942
I just want a smoke.

31:21.009 --> 31:24.210
Johnny, come on.

31:24.278 --> 31:26.379
I know these teenage girls
stress you out,

31:26.448 --> 31:27.881
no matter what you say.

31:27.949 --> 31:30.717
I mean, how do you
deal with it?

31:30.785 --> 31:32.385
Do you like to, um...

31:32.454 --> 31:33.954
go out and shoot something?

31:34.021 --> 31:36.657
Sometimes.

31:36.724 --> 31:39.025
But I don't get
much chance to do that.

31:39.093 --> 31:43.295
Oh, I thought you did
have a chance recently.

31:45.866 --> 31:47.433
I think you did.

31:47.501 --> 31:50.636
Now, you know, I'm just--
I'm just curious.

31:50.704 --> 31:54.173
And then I'll go get you
that cigarette.

31:55.308 --> 31:57.976
I like you, Jennifer.

32:00.112 --> 32:02.514
So...

32:02.582 --> 32:06.451
You took the girls
somewhere to scare them.

32:06.519 --> 32:08.954
Somewhere quiet

32:09.021 --> 32:11.155
and isolated...

32:11.223 --> 32:12.289
Near the water?

32:12.357 --> 32:14.959
I didn't do anything
but scare 'em.

32:15.026 --> 32:17.495
Of course not.

32:19.564 --> 32:21.866
Do you have a place
by the river?

32:21.933 --> 32:24.368
Pretty and smart.

32:24.435 --> 32:26.670
It's not my place.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.539
It's not anybody's
place anymore.

32:29.607 --> 32:34.310
I've taken them
out there before, but this time,

32:34.378 --> 32:37.747
I got their attention.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.084
Sera!

32:43.153 --> 32:45.487
Sera!
Sera!

32:45.555 --> 32:46.522
Sera!

32:46.589 --> 32:47.823
Sera!

32:47.891 --> 32:49.090
Sera!

32:49.158 --> 32:51.159
Sera!

32:51.227 --> 32:53.629
Sera!

32:53.696 --> 32:55.430
Sera!

33:11.446 --> 33:13.047
Here's a shotgun blast.

33:13.882 --> 33:17.250
Katie's phone.
It's dead.

33:17.317 --> 33:19.118
Sera could still
be out there somewhere.

33:19.186 --> 33:21.287
We gotta keep looking.

33:30.031 --> 33:32.264
Morgan, stop, stop.

33:41.908 --> 33:43.475
Sera?

33:50.449 --> 33:52.684
Sera, we're with the FBI.

34:09.033 --> 34:11.301
It's okay.

34:11.368 --> 34:13.770
Put the gun down.

34:36.487 --> 34:39.657
Sera, I know you don't
feel like talking,

34:39.724 --> 34:43.161
but if you think you can,
there's some things

34:43.228 --> 34:46.264
I need to know, and I can't ask
anyone else but you.

34:48.324 --> 34:50.601
He killed my mother, too,
didn't he?

34:50.601 --> 34:52.069
It's hard to say

34:52.136 --> 34:55.438
unless we find
her body.

34:59.944 --> 35:03.480
I want to talk to him.
Would that be okay?

35:03.547 --> 35:04.881
Of course.

35:04.949 --> 35:07.050
Will you come with me?

35:07.118 --> 35:09.418
Mm-hmm.

35:09.486 --> 35:12.388
Let's get you warmed up
first, okay?

35:14.992 --> 35:17.059
There you go.

35:18.195 --> 35:19.628
Are you a mom?

35:19.696 --> 35:20.696
Mm-hmm.

35:20.763 --> 35:23.632
Mine used to wrap me
in this quilt

35:23.700 --> 35:26.734
that she made
before I was born.

35:29.405 --> 35:33.041
She said she always knew
it would be for her little girl.

35:35.411 --> 35:37.979
I miss her.

35:59.099 --> 36:02.368
I'm so sorry.

36:02.436 --> 36:05.038
Dad, you need help.

36:08.409 --> 36:10.643
Did I do that?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.210
I'm sorry.

36:12.278 --> 36:14.913
I'm so sorry.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.948
What can I do?

36:17.016 --> 36:19.451
They say that if you just
tell them where mom is

36:19.519 --> 36:21.019
that this will all just be--

36:21.087 --> 36:22.820
But I don't know.
You know I don't know.

36:22.888 --> 36:26.024
She didn't
just disappear, Dad.

36:28.593 --> 36:31.295
Oh, God, you killed her,
didn't you?

36:31.363 --> 36:33.264
No. No, I didn't.

36:33.331 --> 36:34.532
How am I supposed
to believe you?

36:34.599 --> 36:39.036
This. This is what
you've done.

36:39.104 --> 36:43.374
You have hurt us all
for a long time.

36:44.708 --> 36:47.243
No, don't, Sera. Don't go.

36:47.311 --> 36:49.579
Sera...

36:56.787 --> 36:59.389
The detective said my aunt
was coming. Which one?

36:59.457 --> 37:02.357
Karen. She's driving in
from Charleston.

37:02.425 --> 37:04.493
Are you cold?

37:04.561 --> 37:07.196
A little bit.
The thermostat's right there.

37:07.263 --> 37:09.498
Okay.

37:17.672 --> 37:19.840
It should warm up soon.

37:19.908 --> 37:21.775
Think you'll be able
to sleep?

37:21.843 --> 37:24.545
Yeah, I want a shower first.

37:24.613 --> 37:26.347
Okay.

37:26.415 --> 37:30.151
Um, sure you're gonna
be okay up there?

37:30.219 --> 37:31.719
Yeah, I'll be fine.

37:31.786 --> 37:33.253
Okay.

37:33.321 --> 37:35.589
Um, I could make us
some tea.

37:35.656 --> 37:38.525
That'd be really nice.
Thanks.

37:38.593 --> 37:40.327
Mm-hmm.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.495
Hey.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.531
What's wrong?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.832
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.002
She's just...too casual

38:25.070 --> 38:27.404
and almost cold
since we got here.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.839
It could be the shock.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.575
I know, but she's composed
at the same time.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.759
She has not mentioned
Katie to me, even once,

38:34.784 --> 38:36.143
since we got here.

38:36.243 --> 38:39.645
I couldn't walk into my house
after my sister died,

38:40.051 --> 38:42.251
let alone
walk past her room.

38:42.319 --> 38:46.255
Well, what do you think,
JJ, Sera pulled it off?

38:46.323 --> 38:48.191
I certainly think it may be
a possibility.

38:48.258 --> 38:50.526
It's a very detailed plan.

38:50.594 --> 38:53.095
What, she knew about her father's
condition and took advantage of it?

38:53.163 --> 38:55.964
She set up character witnesses
like Jeff Godwin

38:56.032 --> 38:58.100
to back up her fear.

38:58.168 --> 39:00.135
Sera!

39:01.938 --> 39:04.439
She even got her little
sister to make calls to a hotline.

39:04.507 --> 39:06.975
He's at it again.
He's just going crazy.

39:07.043 --> 39:09.443
She manipulated us
from the minute we found her.

39:09.511 --> 39:11.445
Her writing
suggested no empathy

39:11.513 --> 39:13.815
and no real emotional
connection to family.

39:13.882 --> 39:15.549
Psychopathic
tendencies.

39:15.617 --> 39:17.518
Her wounds
are more than superficial,

39:17.586 --> 39:20.154
but they could be
self-inflicted, right, JJ?

39:20.222 --> 39:24.758
Honey, I know. Mommy is sorry that
she's not home tonight, okay?

39:24.826 --> 39:27.105
But Amy's there with you
and I promise I will

39:27.130 --> 39:29.131
be home as soon as I can.

39:29.831 --> 39:32.465
You okay?
I didn't hear the shower.

39:32.533 --> 39:34.067
Yeah. I just wanted
my tea.

39:34.135 --> 39:37.170
Oh, um, I was gonna bring it to you,
but it should be ready.

39:37.238 --> 39:39.305
Uh, yeah, I'm still here.

39:39.373 --> 39:40.773
We'll be right there.
Stay on the phone.

39:40.841 --> 39:43.142
Mommy's gotta go.

39:44.177 --> 39:46.411
I want Hotch to see
the video of Sera.

39:53.086 --> 39:56.455
Garcia, did you ever find out
who canceled his prescription?

39:56.522 --> 39:58.923
Uh, it turns out to cancel
one of those lifelong prescriptions,

39:58.991 --> 40:01.092
you actually have to put it in writing,
and according to the company records,

40:01.160 --> 40:03.461
it was canceled by
an S. Morrison.

40:50.273 --> 40:53.275
Why did you have to
come down here?

40:56.578 --> 40:58.613
We've been looking for that.

40:58.681 --> 41:03.117
It's an old house.
I know the best hiding places.

41:03.185 --> 41:05.219
But you, what do you
think you know?

41:05.287 --> 41:07.754
You put everything that went missing
with your mother

41:07.823 --> 41:09.824
inside this box.

41:09.891 --> 41:12.592
1999.

41:12.660 --> 41:14.561
Maybe my dad did it.

41:14.629 --> 41:18.965
No. Now, you chose this box
because it's the year Katie was born

41:19.033 --> 41:20.733
and everything changed.

41:20.801 --> 41:22.936
She was your little sister.

41:23.003 --> 41:25.071
Katie ruined everything
and my mother let her.

41:25.139 --> 41:26.272
Your mother loved you.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.975
Well, she loved Katie more.

41:32.346 --> 41:34.779
I should have cried
for Katie.

41:34.848 --> 41:37.950
I guess there's some things
I just can't fake.

41:42.222 --> 41:44.189
You won't do it.

41:44.257 --> 41:47.292
You need to back up--now.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.061
I can say
my trauma kicked in.

41:50.128 --> 41:52.429
PTSD.

41:52.497 --> 41:56.633
I saw you with the gun
and I didn't know what else to do.

41:59.137 --> 42:01.705
You thought of everything.

42:03.308 --> 42:05.976
Sera, put the gun down.

42:07.144 --> 42:09.012
No, no, you don't understand.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.047
She has a gun.
She was going to hurt me.

42:11.115 --> 42:14.851
No. No, Sera, it's okay.

42:14.919 --> 42:16.586
Listen to me.

42:16.653 --> 42:17.888
I understand.

42:17.955 --> 42:19.322
It's okay, Sera.

42:19.390 --> 42:22.324
She wasn't gonna
hurt you.

42:22.392 --> 42:24.593
I know. You've been
through enough.

42:24.660 --> 42:28.097
All right? I get it.

42:31.201 --> 42:32.768
Sera, you're safe now.

42:32.835 --> 42:34.836
Okay?

42:34.905 --> 42:37.171
Okay. Thank you.

42:37.239 --> 42:38.439
Thank you.

42:42.778 --> 42:43.878
What are you doing?!

42:43.946 --> 42:45.880
You're a smart girl, Sera.
Figure it out.

42:45.948 --> 42:47.748
No, stop it!
I swear, please!

42:47.816 --> 42:49.850
No, I swear to you,
she was trying to hurt me!

42:49.919 --> 42:52.186
Please stop.
Please, let me go.

42:52.254 --> 42:56.456
Let me go. No, you don't understand.
Please listen.

42:56.524 --> 43:00.627
February 4th.
The day Judy went missing.

43:00.694 --> 43:02.963
Trophies. If Detective Friedman
had ever found it,

43:03.031 --> 43:04.831
she would have pinned it
all on Bruce.

43:31.824 --> 43:33.925
Alan Lightman said,

43:33.993 --> 43:38.096
"the tragedy of this world
is that no one is happy,

43:38.164 --> 43:43.067
whether stuck in a time
of pain...or joy."
