WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.480
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.524 --> 00:03.699
I can't help
thinking that...

00:03.742 --> 00:05.135
if I had done
things differently

00:05.179 --> 00:06.528
with my friendship
with Lena,

00:06.571 --> 00:08.138
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.661
There's no way of knowing.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.323
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

00:19.367 --> 00:22.848
This is your all-powerful
Fifth Dimensional stalker?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.328
No. I don't know who this is.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.027
I am Mr. Mxyzptlk,

00:27.070 --> 00:29.159
just as I'm sure
that you, Kara Danvers,

00:29.203 --> 00:31.161
are Su--

00:31.205 --> 00:32.858
Get in here.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.731
Thank you so much.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.211
I can't just come in anymore.
I have to be invited.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.126
Tell me who you are
and what you want, now.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.171
I'm your one true love,
your soulmate,

00:41.215 --> 00:42.868
your one true ''pairing''
as the kids say.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.697
My name is Mxyzptlk,
and I love you, Kara Zor-El.

00:45.741 --> 00:48.048
Okay. If you...

00:48.091 --> 00:49.527
-Aw, come on.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.877
If you are Mxy,
then why do you look like this?

00:51.921 --> 00:53.923
Okay, I only took on
that other form

00:53.966 --> 00:56.360
and sophisticated accent
to impress you.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.709
But it worked.

00:57.753 --> 00:58.884
You caught me.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.451
Tricked me.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.583
No,
I followed the rules.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.585
You say your name backwards,

01:03.628 --> 01:05.935
you go back
to the Fifth Dimension,
no questions asked.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.719
Ah,
I miss that hair.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.851
I really, really do.

01:08.894 --> 01:12.115
But now, I can't use
any of my powers,

01:12.159 --> 01:15.901
except to help those
whom I have wronged.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.381
Oh, how sad for you.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.817
Yes.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.733
A tragedy
of Shakespearean proportions,
I agree.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.431
But great news.

01:23.474 --> 01:24.910
You're the last one.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.739
What could I
possibly need your help for?

01:27.783 --> 01:29.741
I killed
my brother for you,

01:29.785 --> 01:32.440
for our friends!
Don't you understand
what you've done?

01:36.618 --> 01:40.100
Your best friend thinks
that she is your enemy.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.579
And the worst part...

01:41.623 --> 01:43.407
It's your fault.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.669
You hid the truth from her.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.237
You let her find out
from that sadist, Lex,

01:47.281 --> 01:48.586
and now, you think

01:48.630 --> 01:49.935
she could be capable
of anything.

01:49.979 --> 01:53.635
-What's your point?
-My point, toots, is this.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.028
Careful.

01:56.986 --> 02:00.642
I am offering you a do-over.

02:00.685 --> 02:01.991
Hmm?

02:02.034 --> 02:03.775
I could send you back in time.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.169
Wouldn't you like
to be able to tell Lena
that you're Supergirl

02:06.213 --> 02:07.997
on your own terms?

02:08.039 --> 02:11.131
Wouldn't you like to see...

02:11.174 --> 02:13.785
what the world
would look like...

02:13.829 --> 02:15.352
if you controlled
the narrative?

02:16.701 --> 02:19.139
-Haven't you hurt enough?

02:19.182 --> 02:20.314
-Hmm?

02:21.663 --> 02:22.968
I get it.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.274
You don't trust me.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.972
Okay, but how's this?

02:27.016 --> 02:29.279
Ready? Now,
by Fifth Dimensional law,

02:29.323 --> 02:32.152
I am required
to give you this recording

02:32.195 --> 02:33.805
of me saying
my name backwards,

02:33.849 --> 02:36.504
in case you ever need
to banish me
to my Fifth Dimension,

02:36.547 --> 02:37.679
-which I know that you--
- Kltpzyxm.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.727
I'm not a villain.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.861
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.171
Hey, girls.

02:53.869 --> 02:54.739
What's going on?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.840
You're not seriously thinking
of doing this, are you?

03:08.884 --> 03:11.234
What if I could change things?

03:11.278 --> 03:14.063
If I told Lena
that I was Supergirl
before Lex,

03:14.106 --> 03:15.673
maybe she would have
reacted differently.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.675
I mean,
isn't that worth a try?

03:17.719 --> 03:20.200
Changing history
to save a friendship?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.549
-Kara, I don't...
I don't know.
-No.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.204
This is changing history
to save history,

03:24.247 --> 03:26.684
'cause Lex and Lena
are planning
something horrible,

03:26.728 --> 03:28.556
and we are no closer
to finding out what that is.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.732
And when the fight comes...

03:30.775 --> 03:33.256
I don't know if I have
what it takes to stop her.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.562
Kara...

03:34.605 --> 03:36.738
are you sure
you can trust Mxy?

03:37.434 --> 03:38.609
No.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.569
But the tape recorder worked.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.354
I... I could always just use it
to get him to go away.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.790
All right,
listen to me.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.053
If you really think
that this is your best chance

03:48.097 --> 03:50.621
to set things right with Lena
before she hurts somebody...

03:52.623 --> 03:53.581
then do it.

03:53.972 --> 03:54.930
Okay.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.238
Uh... How do I do this?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.282
Um...

04:01.415 --> 04:03.286
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.723
Thank Zook
you changed your mind.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.073
Yes, I'm still working
on eavesdropping.
That's a problem.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.294
Okay, uh,
before we do this, Mxy,
I need your word

04:11.338 --> 04:12.600
that if things go sideways,

04:12.643 --> 04:13.731
you'll put it all
back to normal.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.951
I am court-ordered to do so.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.735
Boop.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.911
Now, no shade
to the Super Friends,

04:19.954 --> 04:22.610
but it tends to work better
when it's just me
and the subject.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.786
So, do you two
have any plans?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.788
-No. I don't think so.
-No. No, we were just gonna--

04:27.354 --> 04:28.398
What...

04:28.442 --> 04:29.747
Where did they go?

04:29.791 --> 04:31.140
Oh...
They're in their happy place.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.451
Magic rules!

04:37.494 --> 04:39.322
Game on, Danvers!

04:39.366 --> 04:40.584
All right, so,

04:40.628 --> 04:41.933
how does this work?

04:41.977 --> 04:43.979
I will show you
relevant parts of your life.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.459
You'll tell me when to pause,

04:45.502 --> 04:46.329
I will snap,

04:46.982 --> 04:47.809
like thus,

04:48.462 --> 04:49.985
sending you back.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.421
You will change history.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.336
Once you have
confronted Lena,
you will come back,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.425
we will watch from your loft
and the safety of your couch.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.427
If you are comfortable
with the domino effect...

04:59.168 --> 05:00.778
I will then snap again,

05:00.822 --> 05:02.171
at which point,

05:02.214 --> 05:04.347
-it will become reality.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.827
-Okay?
-Okay.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.656
So, three years of friendship.
Where did it go wrong?

05:12.834 --> 05:13.835
Well...

05:13.878 --> 05:15.619
Uh-huh.

05:15.663 --> 05:19.014
When Lena told me
that she knew I was Supergirl,

05:19.057 --> 05:20.450
-she was furious.
-Yeah.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
-She said I made
a fool out of her.
-Uh-huh.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.454
She was humiliated.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.849
Okay, so, we're looking for
a moment where you made
your best friend

05:27.892 --> 05:29.807
feel like a big,
dumb idiot. Yeah?

05:29.851 --> 05:31.461
-In so many words.
-Okay.

05:31.505 --> 05:34.682
Well, we have
an embarrassment of riches.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.339
-Get your seatbelt back on.
I'm gonna land this plane.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.515
- Oh, yeah,
this is a good one.
- Oh.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.039
Mmm.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.041
Kara? Kara?

05:47.869 --> 05:49.044
God, I hate flying.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.219
- Oh!
-Ugh. This is awful!

05:50.262 --> 05:51.742
-I'm awful!
-You're awful.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.485
I was just agreeing with you.
I would never say that.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.747
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.881
- Oh, okay.
- Ah.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.057
Let's go to
before Mercy attacks.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.188
- Right there?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.189
- You sure?
- Yes.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.103
Don't mess it up.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.023
To be honest,
I didn't have much faith
in politicians to begin with.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.938
I just don't think
any of them can be trusted.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.202
Don't look
so scandalized, Kara.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.595
You know how cynical I can be.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.730
Is everything okay?

06:26.124 --> 06:28.866
You shouldn't have to
be so cynical.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.694
You're good and righteous,

06:30.738 --> 06:32.566
and... and the tragedy is,

06:32.609 --> 06:34.698
the world has made you cynical

06:34.742 --> 06:37.701
because you've been betrayed
so many times.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.921
By your mother,
by your brother...

06:41.749 --> 06:43.403
and now, by me.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.753
What are you talking about?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.936
I'm not who you think I am.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.418
I'm Supergirl.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.426
I never meant to deceive you.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.646
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.434
You stay here.
I'll deal with this.

07:21.789 --> 07:22.790
Lena?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.446
What happened?
Where'd she go?

07:26.489 --> 07:29.449
Ah. Events are unfolding
differently now.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.799
Oh, boy. Um,
I need to catch up.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.757
- Ah,
there she is.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.019
She went to Metropolis.

07:35.629 --> 07:36.630
Oh, my God.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.283
She went to see Sam.

07:38.327 --> 07:41.635
So, Kara is Supergirl?

07:41.678 --> 07:44.289
Yeah, I know.
My head's kind of spinning.

07:44.333 --> 07:48.990
When you were Reign,
and I made Kryptonite
to stop you...

07:49.033 --> 07:53.473
You know, in response,
Supergirl was so horrible.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.605
And then, Kara was the same.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.651
She was so kind and supportive.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.350
But it made me think,
which was the real Kara?

08:02.656 --> 08:05.049
And if the real Kara thought
I was a villain...

08:07.878 --> 08:10.968
then maybe
that's all I really am.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.971
No, Lena, no.
How could you ever think that?

08:14.015 --> 08:17.322
Lena, you made Kryptonite
to split me from Reign

08:17.366 --> 08:19.803
and to save my life.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.849
You were never the villain.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.504
You were always the hero.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.029
Thank you.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.642
I really needed to hear that.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.645
The Lena
in this timeline
might never forgive me.

08:35.688 --> 08:36.690
She might even hate me.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.215
You know what?
You know what?

08:40.258 --> 08:43.000
If Sam stops her
from going down a dark path,

08:43.044 --> 08:44.174
I can live with that.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.829
Except you literally can't.

08:45.873 --> 08:46.700
What do you mean?

08:48.702 --> 08:50.399
Oh, my God.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.054
This is the night
Agent Liberty poisoned the air
with Kryptonite.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.713
Uh,
you know what?

08:59.756 --> 09:01.062
Maybe we should shut this off.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.063
-Huh?
-No, no, no.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.368
Lena saved me the first time.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.022
She might hate me,
but she'll save me again.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.068
She wants to,
but she'll never
make it in time.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.079
Hey, Kara.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.603
I'm sorry
I missed Thanksgiving.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.954
We're just...
We're so lost without you.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.262
I...

09:28.480 --> 09:31.135
am so lost without you.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.579
Happy late Thanksgiving.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.279
Oh.
Can you please turn it off?

09:44.322 --> 09:46.977
I can't watch any more of this.
Just stop it!

09:49.327 --> 09:50.459
That was horrible.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.939
Obviously, you don't want
to stay dead.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.593
-No!
-No!

09:57.161 --> 09:58.641
No, I have to go back further.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.776
I get it now.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.604
I get it now.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.780
My dual identities
made Lena think

10:06.823 --> 10:08.608
that she couldn't trust
either side of me.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.522
I was a hypocrite.

10:10.566 --> 10:14.265
Okay, so, when exactly
did this Kryptonite-fueled
tete-a-tete happen?

10:14.309 --> 10:18.835
Ah... It was... It was, uh,
just after we found out
Lena was housing Reign.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.100
Lena, the Worldkillers
are coming.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.319
-We have to
get you someplace--
-Mmm...

10:24.362 --> 10:25.363
-Skip forward.
-Skip.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.977
You are never going to make
Kryptonite ever again.

10:31.718 --> 10:35.460
-You really do
have a God-complex.
- See, there.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.289
-This fight is what
I'm trying to avoid.
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.551
So, go back.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.687
I need you to find out
if there really isn't
any Kryptonite left.

10:44.731 --> 10:48.169
Kara, you're asking me
to betray somebody
that I really care about.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.910
I never should have done that.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.520
-Uh, yeah, it has to
be before this.
-Yeah, hang on, before.

10:51.563 --> 10:52.826
We have to go back further.

10:53.827 --> 10:54.697
-Here.
-Yep.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.351
My friend came to me.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.658
She was alone and afraid.
I had to do something.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
I need you to level with me.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.011
Do you have
any more Kryptonite?

11:04.054 --> 11:05.665
-This is it.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.710
This is the moment
that Lena started
to distrust Supergirl.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.712
-This is when
I have to tell her, so...
-Okay.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.148
Mmm...

11:12.062 --> 11:14.151
Beam me up, Mxy.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.196
You don't have a catchphrase?

11:16.545 --> 11:17.415
We'll work on that.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.550
''Girl power!'' No.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.031
My friend came to me.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.685
She was alone and afraid.
I had to do something.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.209
That feeling of needing
to protect your friend,

11:28.252 --> 11:29.689
no matter
what the world thinks...

11:31.603 --> 11:33.214
I understand that
more than you know.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.391
You once told me

11:36.434 --> 11:38.523
Kara Danvers was your hero.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.090
I never told you that.
I told...

11:43.877 --> 11:44.878
It's me, Lena.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.055
I've always been Kara.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.536
Kara, how could you?

11:51.580 --> 11:53.321
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.411
Three weeks ago,
I found out that Sam,
one of my closest friends,

11:56.454 --> 11:58.108
was a homicidal Kryptonian.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.546
I went
through that terror alone.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.375
I risked my life
day after day for weeks

12:04.419 --> 12:06.029
because I believed
that I was the only one

12:06.073 --> 12:08.597
who could be trusted
to protect her, to save her.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.599
I could have used your help.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.732
I would have used your help

12:12.775 --> 12:14.864
if you'd bothered to tell me
the truth before now.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.344
If you'd trusted me then,

12:16.387 --> 12:17.780
I wouldn't have had to
go through that danger alone!

12:17.824 --> 12:19.042
I'm so sorry,

12:19.086 --> 12:22.393
but I thought
I was protecting you.

12:22.437 --> 12:26.049
But now, we can...
we can move past it
and work as partners.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.617
You expect me
to be your partner after this?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.402
When all you've done
is prove to me

12:31.446 --> 12:33.100
that you can't
be trusted at all?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.279
Oh, no.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.243
I...

12:46.287 --> 12:47.767
-I forgot.
-Yeah.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.899
-The Worldkiller started
an eclipse that day.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.771
-So, you forgot the...
forgot the eclipse...

12:51.814 --> 12:53.424
...and then, you also forgot
the Kryptonite bomb.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.686
You know what
we're not gonna do?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.601
We're not gonna rely
on your memory anymore

12:56.645 --> 12:58.299
for maybe, like,
big, important details.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.083
-Just sayin'.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.693
We got to try something else.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.260
-How about here?
-No! No.
Just let this play out a bit,

13:03.304 --> 13:05.262
-because in the original
version of events...
-Mmm-hmm.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.787
...Lena helped me and the DEO
to fight the Worldkillers.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.266
-Okay.
-I know she's upset right now,

13:09.310 --> 13:10.267
but she's gonna help us.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.616
Welcome to the bizarro version

13:11.660 --> 13:13.096
where she does not
help the DEO,

13:13.140 --> 13:14.315
-right... right here.
-What?

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
Oh, God! No.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.450
-If Lena doesn't help us
fight the Worldkillers, then--
-Yep.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.974
Wait, wait, wait.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.627
Wait. You're skipping a lot!

13:22.671 --> 13:24.151
This is all exposition,
so much exposition.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.630
Hold on! Was that Mon-El?

13:25.674 --> 13:26.936
Yes.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.503
-So, he didn't go
back to the future?
-No.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.636
Huh. Of course.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.856
If we didn't
defeat Pestilence,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
-then he would have
been there with us...
-Uh-huh.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.511
...when we went
to Sam's mom's house.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.339
Can you...
Can you snap me in there?

13:38.382 --> 13:39.514
I want to get his perspective.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.995
I never understood
what you saw in him.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.525
You need to leave
for your own safety.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.353
I... I won't leave my daughter.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.834
I failed her
when she was a girl.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.400
I refuse to fail her again.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
Well, is there
at least a safe place
for you to hide?

13:58.011 --> 13:59.229
There's a safe room.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.536
I'll wait there.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.368
-We should take up
defensive positions.
-No, wait. Um...

14:08.064 --> 14:09.196
I need your advice.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.548
I finally told Lena
I'm Supergirl.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.506
Wow.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.899
How... How did she take it?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.770
Not well.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.338
And I don't blame her.
I mean, I'm supposed to
be her best friend,

14:21.382 --> 14:22.992
and I... I lied

14:23.036 --> 14:25.690
and betrayed her
just like everyone else
in her life has.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.736
So, what do I do?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.088
You know, Lena and I
have a lot in common.

14:33.568 --> 14:37.224
We've both been betrayed
by our own families.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.009
And when the people
who are supposed to
love you the most

14:40.053 --> 14:42.229
let you down,
it just makes you feel so...

14:43.273 --> 14:44.753
so vulnerable, you know?

14:45.623 --> 14:47.190
But my mother and the Luthors,

14:47.234 --> 14:50.019
they betrayed Lena
for their own selfish reasons.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.194
They...

14:51.238 --> 14:53.066
They wanted to
take advantage of her.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.417
You lied to... to protect her.

14:57.766 --> 14:58.941
Because she's your friend.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.380
Now, I know Lena's hurting
right now, but...

15:03.424 --> 15:04.904
once she understands that...

15:06.470 --> 15:07.732
she'll forgive you.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.039
I hope you're right.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.433
But I don't think
I'll ever be able
to forgive myself.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.959
You know it's okay
to mess up, right?

15:17.003 --> 15:20.093
No matter how many
mistakes I've made,
you've always forgiven me.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.099
You should, uh, know that
you deserve
the same compassion

15:26.142 --> 15:27.317
that you show others.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.843
Reign will be here soon.
We should get ready.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.633
Did you miss me?

16:04.528 --> 16:08.445
Sam! Sam, no, this isn't you!

16:08.489 --> 16:11.144
I know you're in there,
I know you are!

16:13.189 --> 16:14.495
No.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.150
You really thought
you could stop me, Supergirl?

16:17.193 --> 16:20.631
You can't even protect
this one pathetic human.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.676
Oh, Sam...

16:27.073 --> 16:28.813
No. But I can.

16:28.857 --> 16:32.513
Because this is the tool
I use to bring Reign out
and bury you down.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.123
Come back to us, Sam!

16:34.167 --> 16:37.866
I will kill...

16:38.388 --> 16:40.521
you all!

16:40.564 --> 16:41.522
No, you won't.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.528
Sam! Sam!

16:48.703 --> 16:49.573
Lena.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.012
What happened?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.710
Sam, it's okay. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.712
Oh, Sam,
I'm so sorry.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.583
I'm so sorry.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.021
You did it!

17:02.064 --> 17:03.326
You saved Sam.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.894
Yeah, and I did it
without Kryptonite.

17:08.766 --> 17:09.767
No!

17:13.075 --> 17:14.511
Fool!

17:14.555 --> 17:16.731
I am a Worldkiller.

17:16.773 --> 17:19.080
And I cannot be stopped!

17:19.429 --> 17:20.734
No!

17:31.963 --> 17:35.619
Sam! No! No! No! Sam!

17:37.447 --> 17:39.232
No, please!

17:39.275 --> 17:40.581
Come back to me, Sam!

17:43.410 --> 17:44.628
Mxy,
they're all dead.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.066
Please, get me out of here.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.421
Lena was never angry
about hypocrisy.

17:54.464 --> 17:58.207
She was angry because
I never shared my identity
with her in the first place.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.122
So, you know
what that means?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.950
We have to go back
to the very beginning.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.561
Give me a date and a time,
I will make it so.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.085
-Um, let me think.
-Uh...

18:06.128 --> 18:07.086
Hang on a second.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.565
It's just, it's buffering.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.740
This happens sometimes.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.742
It's the
interdimensional Wi-Fi.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.396
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.659
I've got your entire friendship
on BetaMyx.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.969
So, when did
the two of you
become friends?

18:21.012 --> 18:23.232
Uh... It... It was...

18:23.276 --> 18:25.234
Right after Lena moved
to National City.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.149
You have had
a lot of adventures.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.456
"Lena," please.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.979
It's good to see you again,
Miss Danvers.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
-If I'm calling you "Lena"...
-Kara--

18:32.676 --> 18:33.764
- Oh, it's too...
- Anything?

18:33.808 --> 18:35.114
-Too soon.
-Too soon.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.640
I wrote a scathing article
about your device.

18:39.683 --> 18:43.122
Mmm... Getting closer. Here.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.167
I would hate for you
to give me these emails

18:45.211 --> 18:47.126
out of some misplaced
sense of friendship.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.780
This was right before
Lena and I
really became friends.

18:49.824 --> 18:50.999
See, she's about to say,

18:51.042 --> 18:52.827
I didn't come here
to make friends.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.133
She didn't wanna let anyone in,

18:54.176 --> 18:55.438
and then, when she did,

18:55.482 --> 18:57.832
I made the mistake
of not letting her in, too.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.052
This time,
I'm gonna do it right.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.620
Bye!

19:10.366 --> 19:12.325
I didn't come here
to make friends.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.285
I wanna show you something.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.634
Listen, I'm really busy,
so, if we could just--

19:26.382 --> 19:27.383
It's you.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.345
-Kara Danvers is Supergirl.
-Yeah.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.521
Can't believe I was fooled
by a pair of glasses.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.871
Don't worry,
a lot people are.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.526
Oh, God,
I have to recall all those
alien detection devices

19:39.569 --> 19:41.049
'cause they clearly don't work.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.659
You're not angry?

19:42.703 --> 19:44.008
No, it's incredible.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.488
I mean, you're incredible!

19:45.532 --> 19:46.533
But...

19:47.925 --> 19:50.014
Why are you trusting me
with such a big secret?

19:50.058 --> 19:51.494
You barely know me.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.322
Because I know that
what you want
more than anything

19:53.366 --> 19:54.889
is to do good.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.847
And I know it's hard
for you to trust people,

19:56.891 --> 19:59.720
but I need you to know now,
without a doubt,

19:59.763 --> 20:02.026
I trust you.

20:02.070 --> 20:06.074
My cousin,
your brother,
they got it wrong.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.076
Imagine what we
could do together.

20:08.119 --> 20:11.688
A Luthor and a Super,
working together as a team.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.951
If we were partners,
we could change the world.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.785
Only months after publicly
declaring their partnership,

20:21.829 --> 20:24.092
the formidable duo
of Supergirl and Lena Luthor

20:24.135 --> 20:26.573
has already cleaned up
National City's
criminal element.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.358
This pair is
literally unstoppable!

20:29.402 --> 20:31.099
Not to mention, fashionable

20:31.142 --> 20:34.581
after Lena convinced Supergirl
to cut the hair of steel,

20:34.624 --> 20:37.105
and gave her
a new suit to boot.

20:37.148 --> 20:40.064
But their next adversary
is Lillian Luthor herself,

20:40.108 --> 20:42.893
and this time,
their battleground
is a courtroom.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.374
Emotions. Drama.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.550
Will they persevere?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.770
Mxy, can you please
take this seriously?

20:49.813 --> 20:52.729
Take it seriously,
because every party
needs a pooper,

20:52.773 --> 20:55.428
and that's why
we invited Kara.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.169
Really?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.736
If we're gonna take
the fun out of stuff,
let's really do it.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.913
And what is
Supergirl's real name?

21:02.957 --> 21:04.915
I hardly see
how that's relevant.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.919
Citizens have the right
to know the name of the officer
that arrests them.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.313
If Supergirl is gonna act
like judge and jury,

21:11.357 --> 21:12.619
we should know
her name as well.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.578
I plead the Fifth.

21:15.622 --> 21:16.971
Powerful testimonies

21:17.014 --> 21:19.103
in the trial
of Lillian Luthor today.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.802
But will they be undercut
by Lena Luthor's refusal

21:21.845 --> 21:23.934
to give up
Supergirl's identity?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.937
Well, nothing so trifling
as the laws of man

21:26.981 --> 21:28.939
could stand
in the way of Supergirl

21:28.983 --> 21:31.464
and Lena Luthor's
divine victories!

21:32.639 --> 21:34.205
Where I once thought

21:34.249 --> 21:36.991
that true power was
the Kryptonian
walking amongst us,

21:37.034 --> 21:40.342
but that power is nothing
compared to the might

21:40.386 --> 21:43.824
of a Kryptonian
paired with a Luthor!

21:44.825 --> 21:46.174
This is incredible.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.176
The last time
Lillian was on trial,

21:48.219 --> 21:50.483
the whole world suspected Lena
of working with her,

21:50.526 --> 21:53.137
-but having Supergirl
as a partner...

21:53.181 --> 21:56.489
...it gives Lena
the credibility her last name
never could.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.056
-This is it.
-Yes.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.451
This is the timeline
where I truly
do no harm to Lena,

22:02.495 --> 22:05.019
and the world sees her
for the hero she really is.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.151
Of course, I'm more than happy to donate.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.370
Okay.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.198
- Miss Luthor.
- Oh, no.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.634
Is that Lockwood?

22:11.678 --> 22:13.506
You knew my father,
Pete Lockwood?

22:13.549 --> 22:14.724
You're Ben.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.989
We were sourcing our steel
from his factory,

22:19.033 --> 22:20.469
and then he abruptly closed it.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.037
No, he didn't close it.
He converted it to a church.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.213
The Cult of Rao.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.476
I'm so sorry, Ben.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.000
If Supergirl and I
can do anything
to help your father--

22:30.044 --> 22:30.914
You can't.

22:32.525 --> 22:33.352
Because he's dead.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.355
My father, my wife,

22:36.398 --> 22:39.009
my only son, George,
they jumped off a roof

22:39.053 --> 22:42.230
because they believed...

22:43.231 --> 22:44.537
that she would save them.

22:46.060 --> 22:46.930
And she didn't.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.281
I'm so sorry, Ben.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.023
If there's anything
I could do to help--

22:53.067 --> 22:54.590
Well, you could tell me
who Supergirl is.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.028
She parades around as a god,

22:58.072 --> 23:01.554
but she hides in plain sight
as a human.

23:04.252 --> 23:07.429
Miss Luthor, if...
if people knew who she was,

23:07.473 --> 23:10.214
if they knew
that she bought a coffee
in the morning

23:10.258 --> 23:14.044
or that she rode the bus
or that she worked a job
just like the rest of us,

23:14.088 --> 23:16.264
then they would stop
worshipping her.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.401
So, I have to know who she is.

23:23.793 --> 23:27.144
And you are going to tell me.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.190
It's never gonna happen.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.280
And if you have issues
with the Cult of Rao,

23:32.323 --> 23:34.282
I suggest you take it up
with Coville.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.284
Oh... I already have.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.291
Hiya!

23:50.646 --> 23:52.909
Thomas Coville
wants you to believe

23:52.953 --> 23:56.435
that National City's
resident Kryptonian
is someone worth worshipping,

23:56.478 --> 23:57.784
worth dying for.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.829
Is Supergirl a god?

24:01.657 --> 24:03.093
I'm not sure about that.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.573
Not sure about that.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.009
When she goes home at night,

24:06.053 --> 24:09.752
did you know
that she lives
a secret human life?

24:09.796 --> 24:11.798
Until today.

24:11.841 --> 24:17.586
Until today, because today,
Supergirl will reveal
her identity to the world,

24:17.630 --> 24:20.502
or... Coville
and Miss Luthor will die.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
No. Supergirl, don't do it!

24:22.156 --> 24:25.638
So, Supergirl, one hour
of breathable oxygen left,

24:25.681 --> 24:26.769
the clock starts now.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.167
What're you gonna do?
Uh... No spoilers.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.648
I'm loving this.
Uh, I mean...

24:35.691 --> 24:38.128
I can't trace
the signal.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.609
Look, some lone wolf
shouldn't have the resources
to thwart our trackers.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.002
He must have powerful help.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.612
Yeah, help spelled L-E-X.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.310
If that's the case,
then we are
never gonna find her.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.359
Stay here, I got it.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.235
Every morning
when I wake up...

24:59.193 --> 25:00.760
I imagine this moment.

25:02.675 --> 25:06.374
The moment where
being Supergirl gets
someone I love killed.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.855
And I have push that fear
so far down...

25:10.596 --> 25:12.554
...or I... I can't
get out of bed.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.688
But now, here it is.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.866
My greatest fear,
just staring me
right in the face.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.174
I have to save Lena.

25:24.218 --> 25:27.656
I... I have to,
but if I tell the world
who I am,

25:27.700 --> 25:30.703
then I put everyone else I love
at even greater risk.

25:30.746 --> 25:34.010
Alex, J'onn, James, you.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.664
What if one of you gets hurt?

25:35.708 --> 25:38.232
Don't worry about
the rest of us, okay?

25:38.275 --> 25:39.755
We're gonna be fine.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.844
No, Lena is the one
that needs your help
right now.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.542
We can take care
of ourselves...

25:44.717 --> 25:46.240
because you taught us how.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.678
We're here
at National City Hall,

25:49.722 --> 25:52.202
where Supergirl is set
to arrive any minute,

25:52.246 --> 25:55.292
and announce her human identity
to the world.

26:00.602 --> 26:03.126
-Oh, sorry.
-Jeez. You're strong.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.304
Hello.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.132
Hello.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.961
I am Kara Danvers.

26:14.137 --> 26:17.924
Some of you may know me
as a reporter
for CatCo Worldwide Media.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.405
-But I am also...

26:21.449 --> 26:23.582
Kara Zor-El, of Krypton.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.715
I am Supergirl.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.112
Good stuff, my dude!

26:34.505 --> 26:36.595
But we should kill
the hostages anyway, right?

26:37.334 --> 26:38.771
No.

26:38.814 --> 26:40.468
No, we keep our word.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.122
Send them the location.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.956
Are you okay?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.134
Just breathe, Lena. It's okay.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.790
Maybe it's time
the world knows.

27:01.010 --> 27:04.448
I've always been
so afraid to reveal
my identity to the world,

27:04.492 --> 27:06.799
but look, it saved Lena.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.149
Maybe...

27:10.803 --> 27:12.282
Just maybe, this...

27:12.326 --> 27:14.807
this is the timeline
to stick with. Let's...

27:17.026 --> 27:18.506
I see why
you would think that,

27:18.549 --> 27:20.987
but, um, maybe
we should skip ahead
to the ending?

27:21.030 --> 27:23.076
Oh, no, what happens?

27:23.119 --> 27:25.339
After Supergirl's identity
was released to the world,

27:25.382 --> 27:28.951
Agent Liberty
and his followers targeted
each of Supergirl's friends,

27:28.995 --> 27:30.953
including her former
employer Cat Grant...

27:30.997 --> 27:31.998
-No.
-...one by one.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.000
There were no survivors.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.219
-All right, all right,
enough. Stop.
-Alex Danvers, Winn Schott...

27:36.263 --> 27:37.307
-I don't wanna see anymore.
Please turn it off, please.
-...J'onn J'onzz...

27:41.834 --> 27:44.532
It doesn't matter
when I tell Lena the truth.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.534
It always makes things worse.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.366
I think I've been
too scared to admit it
to myself, but...

27:55.021 --> 27:58.677
I think Lena would
be better off if she and I
were never friends.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.201
Is that the world
you wanna see?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.202
No.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.424
Please just show me anyway.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.213
What happened?

28:15.215 --> 28:16.564
Where are we?

28:16.607 --> 28:19.567
Where your loft used to be.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.569
Uh...

28:25.442 --> 28:27.357
You know what? No thanks.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.968
-Nope. I don't need to see it.
-Yeah.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.883
-Can you just
snap us out of here?
-Yep. With pleasure.

28:37.585 --> 28:38.412
What's happening?

28:41.415 --> 28:42.764
I can't feel
the Fifth Dimension at all.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.549
Without my powers--

28:45.593 --> 28:46.420
We're stuck here?

28:57.648 --> 28:58.606
We should get out of here.

28:58.649 --> 28:59.476
You think?

29:02.915 --> 29:07.746
Citizens,
you're out after curfew,
in defiance of Luthor Law.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.101
This world sucks!

29:23.805 --> 29:25.111
You don't know the half of it.

29:27.940 --> 29:28.767
Look who I found.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.118
Oh, Kara,
thank God you're here.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.467
Who's this?

29:33.510 --> 29:35.904
Oh, this is
my friend, Mxyzptlk.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.601
-Mxyzptlk?
- Yeah.

29:37.645 --> 29:38.777
What, you thought
with the new face,

29:38.820 --> 29:41.083
we wouldn't recognize
the same old you?

29:41.127 --> 29:43.259
This is the guy who tried
to make Kara marry him.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.784
It's fine, Mon-El.
Because he is reformed...

29:45.827 --> 29:47.481
and he's actually helping me.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.789
Uh, no... You know what?
No, Mon-El is right. Okay?

29:50.832 --> 29:53.139
It was despicable of me
to pursue a woman

29:53.182 --> 29:56.098
who so clearly
was not interested in me
from the get-go.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.709
I misread the room,
and I'm gonna be better.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.625
It's tough to be an imp.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.454
And I'm gonna try
for the rest of my days.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.021
So, maybe we can let
the past be the past, huh?

30:07.022 --> 30:08.110
Come on.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.634
Wow. Okay, you won.

30:10.678 --> 30:11.810
We'll need all the help
we can get.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.594
All right, well,

30:13.637 --> 30:16.858
look... things are not
as they seem,
and I will explain, but...

30:16.902 --> 30:19.295
First, will someone
please tell me
what's going on here?

30:20.862 --> 30:23.125
People of National City,

30:23.169 --> 30:25.867
I regret to inform you
that the terrorist
known as Supergirl

30:25.911 --> 30:28.261
-is at large.
-Terrorist?

30:28.304 --> 30:31.655
She's working with
a Fifth Dimensional being,
capable of mass destruction.

30:31.699 --> 30:34.136
H.O.P.E. Robots have
been deployed throughout
the city for your protection.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.574
Please, report to them any
and all suspicious activity.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.664
And remember...

30:40.708 --> 30:43.232
My goal is,
as it has always been...

30:44.059 --> 30:45.974
to protect you from harm.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.541
No.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.717
When Lena first came
to National City...

30:51.023 --> 30:52.676
to take over L-Corp,

30:52.720 --> 30:54.504
Lex tried
to have her assassinated.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.984
He failed,

30:56.028 --> 30:58.508
but she was seriously injured
in the attack.

30:58.552 --> 31:01.033
She disappeared for two years.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.513
When she came back,
everybody said that
she was different,

31:03.557 --> 31:04.863
that she had changed.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.560
The trauma,
the loneliness...

31:07.604 --> 31:08.867
it drove her mad.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.565
She retaliated against Lex,
killed him.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.046
Took half of National City
along with her.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.570
Now, she rules what's left
with an iron fist.

31:16.613 --> 31:19.051
-Reign is her enforcer.
-And Brainy, too.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.922
She captured him. Aligned him.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.924
Now, he has no emotions...

31:24.230 --> 31:26.014
and does whatever
Lena tells him to.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.320
Oh, no.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.235
This, this... I have made
a terrible mistake.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.194
This world
is my responsibility.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.370
Okay. Okay,
we can still fix this.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.589
- I need
my powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:35.632 --> 31:36.895
But since we've been here...

31:36.938 --> 31:38.679
They've disappeared.

31:38.722 --> 31:41.725
That must be because
Lena tapped into
the Fifth Dimensional energy

31:41.769 --> 31:43.814
to use it to power
her police robots.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.730
And as long as she's
harnessing the Fifth Dimension,
then you can't access it.

31:46.774 --> 31:49.211
I worked at L-Corp
for about two years
before Lena found me out.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.734
Uh, we caught a criminal.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.214
He didn't have a name,
but he had a hat

31:52.258 --> 31:53.215
that he could
pull anything out of.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.782
Old drinking buddy of mine.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.610
I lost that hat to him
in a poker game.

31:56.653 --> 32:00.222
That hat contains a lot
of Fifth Dimensional magic.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.571
So, if we get you the hat...

32:01.615 --> 32:04.313
Get me the hat,
I can make all of this go...

32:05.271 --> 32:06.315
-bye-bye.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.116
Surrender the imp or die!

32:31.471 --> 32:32.298
Get the hat!

32:34.517 --> 32:35.431
We'll hold her off!

32:35.475 --> 32:37.129
Come on,
I'll show you the way!

32:37.172 --> 32:38.695
And I've got your back!

32:50.490 --> 32:52.318
Brainy, it's me.

32:54.711 --> 32:55.843
It's Nia.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.280
You don't have to do this.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.543
I know I don't have to.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.983
But I think I will enjoy it.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.347
Go to Lena, I've got Reign.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.710
Lena?

33:37.580 --> 33:38.538
It's me.

33:40.235 --> 33:41.541
It's Supergirl.

33:44.718 --> 33:45.719
It's Kara.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.026
Who's Kara?

33:53.901 --> 33:54.902
Just a friend.

33:57.557 --> 33:58.906
You don't know me.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.429
Not really.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.911
But you and I want
the same thing...

34:06.261 --> 34:07.741
to do no harm.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.917
Supergirl wants a world
without harm.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.703
That's rich.

34:13.746 --> 34:17.272
Where were you
when my brother blew
my helicopter out of the sky?

34:19.447 --> 34:23.235
When my mother dragged
my broken body to a laboratory

34:23.277 --> 34:25.585
and experimented on me
instead of fixing me?

34:28.414 --> 34:31.112
Where were you
when this world was
ripped apart by the seams?

34:31.156 --> 34:32.766
Where were you?

34:32.809 --> 34:34.594
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when it mattered.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.118
So am I.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.452
The hat's in this room.
I can feel it.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.293
It's J'onn.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.512
-He needs our help.
-No, he needs this.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.820
Time to face justice,
Manhunter.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.651
J'onn! Catch!

35:37.178 --> 35:38.136
Dreamer, do it now!

36:09.689 --> 36:12.213
You don't know
the first thing about pain.

36:12.257 --> 36:15.912
But I do. I can show you,
make you feel what I feel.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.089
I won't fight you, Lena.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.704
Then you'll die screaming.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.193
Found it.

36:45.725 --> 36:46.726
We're home.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.036
Holy cow!

36:53.080 --> 36:56.039
That was the most
emotionally draining
experience of my life,

36:56.083 --> 36:58.738
and let me tell ya,
I've had some doozies.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.871
Okay. So, it ain't over
till it's over.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.091
So, now,
we've gotta find a time

37:04.134 --> 37:07.225
for you to go back
and tell Lena the truth.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.617
-You ready for one more go?
-No.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.230
No. Absolutely not!

37:12.273 --> 37:16.408
I realize now
that it doesn't matter
when I tell Lena the truth.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.932
There will always
be consequences.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.368
Huge ones.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.762
And if I can't go back
and snap my mistakes away,

37:22.805 --> 37:24.546
I'm just gonna
have to live with them.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.808
-Oh...

37:27.462 --> 37:28.898
Oh...

37:28.942 --> 37:30.248
-Oh, boy.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.772
Okay.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.601
I know it didn't turn out
the way we expected,
but you...

37:36.297 --> 37:37.777
You still helped me, Mxy.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.781
You freed me
from my burden of guilt, so...

37:44.349 --> 37:45.611
-Go, be free.
-Ah.

37:45.654 --> 37:49.397
Use your magic to do
whatever it is you do.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.268
Thank you.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.617
Um...

37:52.444 --> 37:54.924
And I should say, uh...

37:54.968 --> 37:56.796
Before I met you,
I was, um...

37:57.449 --> 37:59.451
I was pretty lonely.

37:59.494 --> 38:03.629
You know, and in that pain,
I... I would tend to sort of,
force myself...

38:03.672 --> 38:05.152
on people, and, uh...

38:06.980 --> 38:09.287
Out there with you today,

38:09.330 --> 38:10.984
saving the world,
I felt like, um...

38:12.464 --> 38:16.294
I felt like I was liked,
for being me.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.295
I felt like I had friends.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.340
And, uh...

38:20.385 --> 38:21.864
it's true
what you said, Kara.

38:23.649 --> 38:24.476
That magic...

38:25.477 --> 38:26.478
can't be forced.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.480
It has to be found.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.006
I'm proud of you, Mxy.

38:34.703 --> 38:35.835
Thanks for everything.

38:37.663 --> 38:38.707
You're welcome.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.191
Now, if you'll excuse me,

38:44.234 --> 38:46.541
I'm off to Mardi Gras
in the '80s.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.892
The 1780s.

39:25.885 --> 39:28.235
Let me guess...

39:28.278 --> 39:30.890
You're here to
tell me once again
that I should forgive you.

39:32.544 --> 39:35.677
Or maybe that I shouldn't
work with my brother?

39:35.721 --> 39:36.591
Not this time.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.420
I recognize I made a mistake

39:39.464 --> 39:41.683
in hiding my identity
from you for so long,

39:41.727 --> 39:44.556
but the past is the past,
and I can't change it.

39:45.774 --> 39:48.690
Forgive me or not,
that's your choice.

39:48.734 --> 39:52.085
Just like it's your choice
to work with Lex.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.566
I'm done blaming myself
for your bad decisions.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.439
Then why are you here?

40:00.485 --> 40:02.574
To tell you that
from now on,

40:02.617 --> 40:04.445
you're accountable
for your own actions.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.407
If you decide to forgive me,
I will be there for you.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.279
But if you continue
to work with Lex...

40:12.322 --> 40:16.457
If you go through
with whatever it is
the two of you are planning,

40:16.501 --> 40:18.459
I will do everything
in my power to stop you...

40:20.635 --> 40:22.289
just like I would
any other villain.

40:35.302 --> 40:37.478
This is an extraordinary
amount of food.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.915
A parting gift from Mxy.

40:39.959 --> 40:42.440
Well, I think
we should have Mxy
here more often.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.096
I hear
Fifth Dimensional interventions

40:47.140 --> 40:48.576
do wonders
for one's perspective.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.577
You know what?

40:49.621 --> 40:52.450
Actually, they really do.

40:52.493 --> 40:56.149
Seeing all those
alternate versions of reality
made me realize,

40:56.192 --> 40:59.108
second-guessing myself
doesn't do any good.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.588
No.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.025
So, if I make a mistake,
I just have to move on.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.163
What is that smile?

41:11.207 --> 41:12.470
You guys.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.038
Guys, you've been
with me from...

41:17.039 --> 41:19.172
the second I became Supergirl.

41:22.392 --> 41:25.831
In my best moments
and especially
my worst moments.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.488
That means the world to me.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.402
Sames.

41:33.229 --> 41:34.230
Back at you.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.321
El-may-arah.

41:38.365 --> 41:39.235
-Aw.

41:40.062 --> 41:41.368
"Stronger together."

41:42.674 --> 41:44.980
-Potato.
-Po-tah-to.
