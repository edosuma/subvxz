[horse nickers]

00:19.602 --> 00:22.689
-Okay, Ethan, this is the last camera.
-Oh. Nice.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.316
Can we bike home together?
I'm hungry.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.029
You read my mind.
I finished putting away most of my tools.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.281
We wrapping up?
Are the ducklings settled?

00:31.614 --> 00:33.867
I've set up heat lamps
and we gave them dinner.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.785
[sighs] Lucky ducklings.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.662
They're definitely lucky you found them.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.664
Abandoned eggs
don't last long on their own.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.876
I think we're ready. Can you look
at the screen for a moment?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.547
[both] Hi, Ethan.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.923
Okay.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.426
Thanks for setting up the Cinnamon Cam.

00:51.509 --> 00:55.138
Now that she's due,
Cinnamon could go into labor any moment.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.016
The cameras are on.
You can take look at her anytime.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.145
-The first foal born at the ranch.
-Twelfth animal born this week.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.772
I love springtime.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.065
I love dinnertime.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.150
-I love cameras.

Skye?

01:50.443 --> 01:54.405
I was thinking "Clove" could be
a good name. Cinnamon and Clove.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.408
Skye, what are you doing
out here so early?

01:57.700 --> 02:01.037
I wanted to spend time with Puzzle
before the day got too busy.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.958
Busy? Honey, it's Saturday.
You could have slept in a little.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.128
I was going to,
but I wanted to check my Cinnamon Cam.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.297
She was a bit restless.
I went to her stall,

02:11.381 --> 02:14.551
and sure enough,
she is showing signs of early labor.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.846
Oh, my goodness.
You should've woken me up.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.975
You were up late last night working.
I thought you could use the sleep.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.937
Thanks, honey, but I should go
wake up Dad and call Dr. Singh.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.566
Grandpa's with Cinnamon right now.
Dr. Singh's coming over

02:29.649 --> 02:32.110
-after she delivers the Donnellys' calf.
-Mmm.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.945
And I made you some coffee.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.657
-Am I still dreaming? [scoffs]
-Maybe. [chuckles]

02:37.991 --> 02:39.951
You're definitely still wearing pajamas.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.662
Yes. I should change.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.456
We need to help Dad
until Dr. Singh arrives.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.749
Pants are a good idea.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.710
-[Puzzle nickers]
-Always.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.422
[birds chirping]

02:53.339 --> 02:55.592
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Aw, donors are gonna fall in love

02:55.675 --> 02:58.094
when they see pictures
of the new arrivals.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.931
If only it was warm enough for them
to be playing in the pasture,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.183
then we could catch them in action.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.270
-Unless...
-Good morning, ducklings.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.023
-[ducklings peeping]
-They sure are excited to see you.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.149
Here you go.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.903
Oh. Go on, guys, snuggle in. Stay warm.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.822
I suppose a hot water bottle
isn't as snuggly as a mother duck.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.492
Poor little ducklings. Must be hard
growing up without their mom.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.163
-Hey, everyone.
-[all] Morning.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.917
Well, great news.
Cinnamon has just gone into labor.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.127
-Cool!
-No way!

03:31.210 --> 03:33.880
So I'm thinking we should use
the Riding Ring to--

03:33.963 --> 03:36.758
[Bianca] Great news, everyone!

03:37.008 --> 03:42.013
Shelby and I look fabulous
in our new riding outfits.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.014
[Olivia] Hmm.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.022
Oh. Uh... [clapping]

03:53.733 --> 03:56.444
Just a little spring cleaning.
Out with the old...

03:56.527 --> 03:58.571
[both] And in with the new.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.243
And I got brand-new riding boots.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.661
[Trish] Wow.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.705
Well, we should put those outfits
to good use.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.165
Shelby, could you be in charge

04:09.249 --> 04:11.417
of exercising horses
in the Riding Ring today?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.086
Oh, I'll help.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.214
That's a lot of work for two people.

04:16.297 --> 04:20.468
Well, I would help, but I'm assisting
with Cinnamon's delivery.

04:21.010 --> 04:24.180
Bianca, you look ready to ride.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.891
Oh, I do, don't I?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.602
Could you help exercise the horses?

04:29.894 --> 04:32.313
Oh. No.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.858
Mom, you should stay.
You're always asking what I do here.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.069
[gasps] I can finally show you.

04:39.237 --> 04:43.658
Oh, twist my arm.
I'll stay and save the day.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.537
Those ponies are going to be exercised

04:47.620 --> 04:51.666
like they've never been exercised before.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.669
I bet they will. [chuckles]

04:54.752 --> 04:57.755
-Well, I'm gonna go see Cinnamon.
-Okay. Good luck.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.343
[peeping]

05:02.593 --> 05:04.012
[horse nickers]

05:04.971 --> 05:06.681
[sighs] How's Cinnamon coming along?

05:07.265 --> 05:10.810
She's doing well.
For now, it's a bit of a waiting game.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.312
[nickers]

05:12.687 --> 05:16.232
Skye, since we have some time
before the foal arrives,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
why don't you take a break

05:18.401 --> 05:20.320
and get work done
on your English projects?

05:20.403 --> 05:24.157
I couldn't possibly stay inside
and focus on work right now.

05:25.116 --> 05:28.828
Foal or no foal,
your schoolwork is important.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.249
I know, Mom.
I promise, I'll get it done before Monday.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.834
Promise.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.921
She reminds me so much of you
when you were her age.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.091
Never wanted to do schoolwork
on a Saturday, either.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.928
I wish there was some way
we could help her.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.182
It's best just to let things
happen naturally.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.393
I bet she's so excited. I'm excited.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.936
And nervous. [gasps]

05:54.270 --> 05:56.439
Do you think Cinnamon's nervous?

05:56.647 --> 06:00.443
We could play some music.
I know that helps to calm my nerves.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.322
Well, uh, from my research, um,

06:04.781 --> 06:08.034
horses prefer quiet
during the birthing process.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.454
Skye, when did you have time
to do all this research?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.957
-You have school--
-[cell phone chiming]

06:15.041 --> 06:16.167
[beeps]

06:18.503 --> 06:19.462
Hello, Ms. Phan?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.632
Billy. Oh, thank goodness. It's Bianca.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.010
Oh. Hi, Bianca.

06:26.094 --> 06:31.015
Your daughter has put me to work
exercising your horses.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.186
So far, it's been an exercise
in exhausting me.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.940
-I am in need of some refreshment.
-[horse neighs]

06:39.023 --> 06:44.737
Overworked volunteers
are not good PR for your ranch!

06:45.029 --> 06:46.155
Okay.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.074
[beeps]

06:50.910 --> 06:53.496
Bianca, what are you doing?

06:53.996 --> 06:56.082
I'm taking a break.

06:56.165 --> 06:59.127
How can you take a break?
You haven't done any work yet.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.712
That's not true.

07:01.796 --> 07:07.051
I have managed
to get these ropes very tangled.

07:07.135 --> 07:11.013
Why don't you take Ray?
He's all saddled up and ready to go.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.976
Unfortunately, I'm not ready to go.

07:15.893 --> 07:19.021
I am waiting on some refreshment.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.399
You did agree to stay and help.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.694
You two go ahead.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.114
-I'll be along in a few dozen minutes.
-[horse nickers]

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
-[Isabella] Come on.
-[Bianca] Be nice.

07:32.660 --> 07:36.706
And... I might have Billy
bring you some refreshment, too.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.709
Oh. Oh...!

07:40.751 --> 07:43.421
Are the ducks ready for their close-ups?

07:43.504 --> 07:44.422
[peeping]

07:45.256 --> 07:48.176
[Ethan] We could stick them
into all kinds of fun adventures.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.095
[laughs] That's a great idea. Let's do it.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.974
They can just be
their adorable little selves.

07:55.057 --> 07:59.562
But on the moon, in the mountains,
and on the beach!

08:01.397 --> 08:03.733
Whoa, be careful with the camera.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.069
Olivia, could you take a step back?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.156
[peeping]

08:10.239 --> 08:12.158
[Ethan] Oh, fuzzy cuteness is on the move.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.454
He said Olivia, not "all of ya."

08:16.537 --> 08:17.371
[peeping]

08:17.663 --> 08:19.957
Uh, okay, good. Now, stay.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.212
-Are they following you?
-Seems like it.

08:24.295 --> 08:28.841
[gasps] This is so cool. [chuckles]

08:30.384 --> 08:34.931
Billy, there are ducks following me
and I don't know why.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.558
I can't shake them.
They're following me everywhere.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.812
I've seen this before.
It looks like they've "imprinted" on you.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.731
-Were you there when they hatched?
-Of course.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.733
I was there to make sure they were okay.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.152
They think that you're their mother.

08:48.486 --> 08:52.073
I can't be their mother. I'm not a duck.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.076
No. But it looks like these little guys
are looking to you

08:55.159 --> 08:58.162
to show them skills they need
to grow and survive.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.916
So, I need to teach these ducks
to be ducks?

09:03.084 --> 09:04.210
Awesome.

09:04.293 --> 09:07.338
Oh. [chuckles] There you go, Trish.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.383
-Great job. You did amazing.
-[Shelby] Great job. Okay.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.801
So, two down and--

09:14.762 --> 09:16.889
Where did Mom go?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.976
[Isabella] Bianca!

09:20.059 --> 09:23.271
Why is Ray over there
walking around by himself?

09:23.729 --> 09:24.772
He's exercising.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.148
Mom.

09:26.983 --> 09:32.321
Skye said we had to exercise the horses,
not ride them.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.575
I don't see why
I should have to do his chores for him.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.077
A chore? Riding horses is fun.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.996
Have you ever ridden a horse?

09:41.038 --> 09:41.998
No.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.794
Is that what this is about?
Mom, there's no reason to be nervous.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.962
We can teach you.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.798
-Yeah, we can teach her.
-[horse nickers]

09:51.674 --> 09:52.842
[murmurs] Mm-hmm...?

09:58.055 --> 10:03.519
You are doing so great, Cinnamon.
It is not gonna be long now.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.523
Where's Skye?
I've got sandwiches inside for lunch.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.067
She went off to get Cinnamon some lunch.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.527
[sighs] Of course she did.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.654
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.406
-[beeps]
-Hello?

10:16.824 --> 10:18.367
Hi. Okay, great.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.246
Yep, great. We'll see you soon. Okay, bye.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.124
-[cell phone beeps]
-[sighs]

10:25.458 --> 10:26.709
Everything's okay?

10:27.084 --> 10:29.295
Yeah, Dr. Singh is on her way. [sighs]

10:29.503 --> 10:31.797
And that is good news, right?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.592
Yes, it's great news.

10:35.426 --> 10:39.138
I'm sorry. I'm just waiting on a call
from Skye's English teacher.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.266
She wants to discuss
Skye's progress at school.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.896
Ah, and that would be
why you're being so hard on her.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.651
I'm just worried
she's neglecting her studies.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.655
With her dyslexia, Skye has to work harder

10:55.738 --> 10:59.575
than all the other kids at school.
Plus, she's always so determined

10:59.659 --> 11:02.912
to be involved with everything here
on the ranch, too. I--

11:03.454 --> 11:05.873
You know, you have to trust her, Billy.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.502
She's proven time and again
that she can balance schoolwork

11:09.585 --> 11:11.128
with her time on the ranch.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.755
She's a good kid.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.052
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.890
-[sighs]
-You know, we are very close here.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.683
Come on, Cinnamon!

11:25.267 --> 11:27.061
-[sighs]
-She's gonna be a good mom.

11:27.728 --> 11:32.400
-[peeping]
-Okay, guys. Lesson number one, swimming.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.363
So, you just kinda float around
on your tummies

11:37.446 --> 11:41.367
and kick your little webbed feet
back and forth as shown.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
[peeping]

11:43.953 --> 11:46.956
All right. So I'll be right here
if you need me.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.125
-Who wants to try first?
-[peeping]

11:51.710 --> 11:54.505
[sighs] It's been too long.
Something isn't right.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.674
Skye, honey, try to relax.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.801
Ugh. But it's been all day.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.304
[sighs] What is it, Cinnamon?
What's not right?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.306
Skye, you should take a break.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.559
You've been out here since dawn.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.604
We should take a step back
and wait for Dr. Singh to arrive.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.568
Well, that's it. We are what's not right.

12:16.026 --> 12:20.823
I've read that horses
prefer a safe, quiet space for delivery.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.618
I bet Cinnamon would prefer
a more privacy, too.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.663
-So, what are you thinking?
-[horse nickers]

12:27.955 --> 12:30.291
The Cinnamon Cam. We have it set up.

12:30.374 --> 12:34.670
We can monitor Cinnamon, the delivery,
and give her space she needs to relax.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.672
Yes, but we should stay close.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.049
We'll be in the clubhouse
around the corner.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.510
If she needs anything,
we'll be here in seconds.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.637
I like the way you think.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.140
I'll get my laptop.
Meet me in the Clubhouse.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.183
Let's go.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.353
[ducklings peeping]

12:52.021 --> 12:55.191
Mmm! Food. Yummy.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.195
If you wanna grow big and strong,
you need to eat and find food on your own.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.363
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

13:01.447 --> 13:06.368
Okay. Release the ducklings! Go, go, go.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.122
Look at them. [chuckles]
Makes you proud to be a mama.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.375
That's about it, really.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.171
Just remember to sit tall,
keep your weight in your saddle

13:17.338 --> 13:20.758
and try to relax.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.967
[exhales] Whew.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.427
Why don't you hop on Ray?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.763
-I don't want to ride Ray.
-[Ray nickers]

13:25.971 --> 13:29.683
You don't want to ride a horse
or you don't wanna ride Ray?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.102
It's okay to be nervous.

13:32.436 --> 13:38.108
Shelby, [chuckles]
I am not scared of riding a horse.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.403
I'm sure I'll be perfectly fabulous at it.

13:41.487 --> 13:48.244
I just-- I don't feel comfortable
riding... a rescue horse.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.454
I don't know its history.

13:50.621 --> 13:55.125
Isabella, why don't you go take Apollo
for his exercise?

13:55.334 --> 13:58.337
You want me to ride Apollo? Really?

13:58.587 --> 14:02.383
Really. Get him up to a good gallop.
He likes that.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.513
You'll really like Ray
once you get to know him.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.015
He takes care of all of his riders.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.892
You don't know him yet.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.854
And [chuckles]
you're not really a rider yet.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.857
I'm wearing a helmet, for goodness' sake.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.695
-My pants are covered with dirt and hay.
-[Ray nickers]

14:22.778 --> 14:24.280
I'm trying my best.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.534
I know. But you're a little uneasy
around the horses.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.035
They can sense that.

14:30.119 --> 14:36.917
Shelby, I think your horses are lovely.

14:37.501 --> 14:42.256
I know, Mom. But it's probably best
if you put him back in the stall.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.593
I'll take him for his exercise
when I'm done with Puzzle.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.013
[chains jangling]

14:49.096 --> 14:53.183
Nervous? Scared? [chuckles]

14:53.976 --> 14:54.935
Am I?

14:55.603 --> 15:00.274
W-Well, Shelby might be a teeny bit right.

15:00.524 --> 15:06.947
Perhaps I am ever so slightly uneasy.

15:08.073 --> 15:12.620
[exhales] Breathe. Think calm.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.247
I am calm.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.042
So calm.

15:18.208 --> 15:22.504
So, you're a good horse,
are you? [chuckles]

15:23.881 --> 15:27.509
Ray, let's do this.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.262
[nickers]

15:51.241 --> 15:53.619
[horse whinnies]

16:07.383 --> 16:08.509
[bleats]

16:10.177 --> 16:11.345
Hello.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.514
-[door closing]
-Dr. Singh. Come in.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.725
Hi.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.438
[nickering]

16:21.522 --> 16:23.232
Wow. Would you look at that?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.526
-Very smart. [chuckles]
-Thank you.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.737
-What do you think?
-Really good idea.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.947
[Grandpa] It works.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.284
-I think it's time.
-I think you're right.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.250
-[ducklings peeping]
-They grow up too fast.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.836
I'm gonna miss being their mama duck.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.756
They've made a big imprint on me, too.
Although it was exhausting.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.342
We'll always remember that time
we took them to the moon.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.760
[all chuckling]

16:51.844 --> 16:56.348
Oh, it's a shame
we had to stop all that riding.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.935
Oh, I feel born anew,

17:00.019 --> 17:03.105
I think Ray
has had enough exercise for today.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.900
[scoffs] You were right.
Ray was wonderful.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.194
-[Shelby chuckles]
-And that mane of his,

17:09.278 --> 17:13.323
how does he keep it so shiny
and luxurious?

17:14.199 --> 17:17.202
Do you think you're ready
to try trotting now?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.079
Perhaps tomorrow.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.624
But only if you both return
as my teachers.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.335
Oh, I'd love to.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.672
Shelby, dear, what are you doing?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.174
It's springtime.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.052
Out with the old
and in with the new, right?

17:33.343 --> 17:35.763
I'm donating my boots to the ranch.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.432
But those are your new boots.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.476
I did need new clothes,

17:40.559 --> 17:43.479
but sometimes,
the older things are a better fit.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.274
Oh. How noble of you.

17:47.357 --> 17:51.570
Oh, quick. Ethan, snap a picture of us
being generous for the website.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.074
Mom! I'm not doing this for the glory.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.201
I'm doing this for the ranch.

17:57.284 --> 18:00.579
I actually like it here with Apollo

18:00.662 --> 18:02.790
and all the other horses,

18:02.873 --> 18:04.291
and my...

18:05.709 --> 18:07.002
my...

18:08.212 --> 18:10.380
[whispers] Is she gonna say "friends"?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.008
Fellow horse enthusiasts.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.927
[whispers] Close enough.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.095
[both chuckling]

18:16.178 --> 18:19.473
All right, Shelby.
We're all enthused about you, too.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.184
Group hug! Come here.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.562
Room for another horse enthusiast?

18:25.646 --> 18:26.980
-Yes.
-Oh.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.692
Okay, enough now. You'll wrinkle her.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.741
-Have you thought of a name, Skye?
-Clove. Like Cinnamon and Clove.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.409
-Get it?
-[both chuckling]

18:39.493 --> 18:43.789
-I like it. Especially in apple cider.
-[all chuckling]

18:45.249 --> 18:46.708
Skye, where you going?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.586
I'm gonna check on Puzzle,
make sure he's eaten dinner.

18:49.795 --> 18:54.007
You were on the go so early this morning.
You've done enough for today.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.052
-It doesn't feel like work, Mom.
-[horse whinnying]

18:58.387 --> 19:02.057
-[cell phone chiming]
-Oh.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.142
Hello?

19:04.268 --> 19:07.688
Ms. Phan, hi.

I can still do schoolwork before dinner.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.817
It's okay. Finish up.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.961
I'm really proud
of what you did today Skye, but...

20:13.045 --> 20:14.379
But what?

20:15.005 --> 20:18.425
I'm even more proud
of what you've done at school.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.596
Ms. Phan called me to tell me
how well you've been doing.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.516
Apparently, your reading and writing
skills have improved quite a bit.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.687
I think you're gonna have
a positive report card, sweetheart.

20:31.855 --> 20:35.859
I've been working so hard. I just--
I never know if it's gonna pay off.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.111
[chuckles] Well, it did.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.696
[sighs]

20:39.780 --> 20:42.532
In a few ways, actually.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.534
Listen.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.373
You and the Ponysitters
have done so many amazing fundraisers

20:49.456 --> 20:51.250
that we now have the resources

20:51.333 --> 20:55.212
to care for all of the rescue animals
for quite a bit.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.463
Amazing.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.466
Honey, I think you've proven
you can balance school

20:59.549 --> 21:00.801
and the Ponysitters.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.102
Skye, I think you should have Puzzle.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.815
Thank you.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.278
Thank you.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.197
Thank you for understanding
how much Puzzle means to me.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.034
Well, love is one thing
I completely understand.

21:26.118 --> 21:26.952
[chuckles]

21:28.453 --> 21:32.124
Oh, my gosh! Puzzle.
Well, we have to celebrate.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.668
I love you, Mom.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.212
[sighs] I love you, too, Skye.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.594
-Now let's give this guy a hug.
-Yeah.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
[both chuckling]

21:47.556 --> 21:50.851
It finally happened, Puzzle.
This is gonna be your home.

21:52.769 --> 21:53.979
Forever.
