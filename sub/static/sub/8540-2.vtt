WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.179
[siren wailing]

00:12.795 --> 00:13.970
Oh.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.194
[Jane]
What's the fuss?

00:20.281 --> 00:22.457
[Cho]
Slept through Lisbon's
briefing in the van, didn't you?

00:23.849 --> 00:25.416
Like a baby.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.114
[Cho]
Yeah, the victim's
name is Kristin Marley.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.593
She worked at the State Capitol
for some lady senator.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.204
Went missing three days ago.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.422
Rumor is she was
having an affair

00:31.509 --> 00:33.903
'with the senator's husband.'

00:40.214 --> 00:42.564
- My bet. She's a jumper.
- I hope not.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.087
If she's a jumper,
job's done.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.567
Yeah, the senator's husband
dumps her

00:45.654 --> 00:47.395
she wants to make him feel bad,
she comes out here..

00:47.482 --> 00:48.831
[whistles]
...splat.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.702
Don't talk that way.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.575
Okay, not splat. Bam.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.404
There's nothing worse than
suicide. Human life is sacred.

00:56.491 --> 00:59.015
When someone takes
their own life, it's a tragedy.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.496
Sacramento PD's
handing the case over to us.

01:01.583 --> 01:05.152
Let's go talk
to the coroner.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.677
Shall I recap
the case, sleepyhead?

01:08.764 --> 01:12.072
Kristin Marley,
lady senator's aide

01:12.159 --> 01:14.726
rumored romance
with the senator's husband.

01:14.813 --> 01:15.988
Very good.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.034
Oh, I trained myself
to hear

01:18.121 --> 01:21.255
and take in information
while asleep.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.474
- The others told you?
- Yes, they did.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.520
[male #1]
At this point,
there's no way to determine

01:25.607 --> 01:27.261
what happened
to the victim, Agent Lisbon.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.045
I-I simply can't help you.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.699
Well, can you tell
how long she's been dead?

01:30.786 --> 01:33.441
[scoffs]
Couldn't possibly
given the evidence available.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.356
Well, do you think it was
a homicide or a suicide?

01:35.443 --> 01:38.054
- 'Couldn't say.'
- 'What's your guess?'

01:38.141 --> 01:41.710
I'm not in the habit
of, of guessing.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.364
Please don't touch
the decedent.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.106
Y-you detectives always
want the instant answers.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.498
What I do is science.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.326
Science will...uncover the truth

01:49.413 --> 01:53.722
but she will be precise,
methodical and take her time

01:53.809 --> 01:55.680
before she renders
her decision.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.292
Wonder if science can remove
the stick from his butt.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.946
- I heard that.
- You're right. We want facts.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.209
Fortunately, we have them.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.906
Oh, we do?

02:03.993 --> 02:06.300
In abundance.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.518
You're the consultant
that pretends

02:07.605 --> 02:09.477
to read minds, aren't you?

02:09.564 --> 02:11.392
No. I don't pretend
to read minds.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.784
Idoread minds.

02:12.871 --> 02:13.916
But don't we all?
Look at Lisbon.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.352
You can see
what she's thinking.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.832
No kidding.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.097
And I can see what
you're thinking right now.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.840
Uh, I-I was thinking that
you, sir, are a bumptious fool

02:24.927 --> 02:26.929
and I was wondering
exactly what training

02:27.016 --> 02:28.800
in forensic pathology you have.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.933
Ah, but right before that,
you were wondering

02:31.020 --> 02:34.284
whether you would choose Lisbon
or Van Pelt as your concubine

02:34.371 --> 02:38.245
in that little fantasy kingdom
you like to visit sometimes.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.072
What? I do not.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.813
Oh, and-nd you're right.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.338
I-I know nothing
of forensic pathology.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.557
'But agent Van Pelt..'

02:46.644 --> 02:49.821
...she might offer...her theory.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.214
Or I might not.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.564
- Look at her feet.
- I did.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.566
And what question
presents itself?

02:59.091 --> 03:00.789
- Where's her other shoe?
- Exactly.

03:00.876 --> 03:01.877
[Cho]
'It wasn't
up on the bridge.'

03:01.964 --> 03:03.444
It could be in her car.

03:03.531 --> 03:04.967
Even if it was,
why would she walk to

03:05.054 --> 03:06.360
the middle of the bridge
with one shoe on?

03:06.447 --> 03:08.362
- Why would she do that?
- Bingo.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.320
There's no need
to be patronizing.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.453
So she must have been carried.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.933
She didn't kill herself. She was
murdered, then dropped over.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.892
Or thrown over still alive.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.763
Better than suicide.

03:18.850 --> 03:22.724
It's...a theory.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.160
It's lovely to meet you, doc.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.988
You're a horse's ass,
but you mean well.

03:26.075 --> 03:29.165
- I'll be in the van.
- Oh.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.167
My apologies, sir.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.475
Cho, tell the Sacramento PD
that it's a homicide.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.694
Rigsby, Van Pelt, see what
the sheriff's department

03:36.781 --> 03:38.914
got in their investigation.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.307
[Rigsby]
Alright.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.398
[theme music]

03:58.542 --> 04:01.415
Kristin had been interning
here for about nine months.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.112
She came in at the start
of the last session

04:03.199 --> 04:04.766
right out of college.

04:04.853 --> 04:08.030
I liked her. She was sweet,
young, in a good way.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.641
- Who did she work for?
- Senator Melinda Batson.

04:10.728 --> 04:14.384
'She's an up-and-comer
from the Central Valley.'

04:14.471 --> 04:16.343
Please put that down.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.390
Anything to the rumor
that Kristin was having

04:20.477 --> 04:22.044
an affair
with Batson's husband?

04:22.131 --> 04:25.569
Elliott Batson.
He's Melinda's chief of staff.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.919
We've heard the rumors.
Everyone denies it.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.834
There's no evidence
anything happened.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.010
The media
seem to think there is.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.796
You wanna get me started
on what they believe?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.841
Frankly, when you've worked
here as long as I have

04:36.928 --> 04:39.714
you hear a lot of stories
about wild behavior.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.063
Most of them aren't true.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.325
[amplified]
Except the ones that are.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.500
[microphone feedback whines]
Whoa.

04:43.587 --> 04:44.719
'Sorry.'

04:48.940 --> 04:50.507
Hello.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.292
Hello. Hello. Hello.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.209
I've issued a statement, and
I'm not taking any questions.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.908
We're not press.
We're CBI.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.345
Agent Teresa Lisbon,
Patrick Jane.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.261
Right. Sorry. You called.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.698
Melinda Batson.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.657
This is my husband Elliott.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.615
Hi.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.878
Tsk. Tough day around here.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.667
Is this Kristin's desk?

05:19.754 --> 05:21.669
- Yes.
- Mm.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.411
Come inside.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.720
Jane.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.070
- Care to join us?
- I'll be right there.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.088
Anything unusual
about Kristin's behavior

05:50.175 --> 05:52.090
the day she disappeared?

05:52.177 --> 05:54.528
No, she was, uh, cheerful.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.357
Finished work, left at 6:00,
I think, uh..

05:57.444 --> 05:59.837
- A little after 6:00.
- After 6:00 then.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.883
Did she say
where she was going?

06:01.970 --> 06:04.364
- No.
- No.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.889
She...was having trouble
with her family.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.195
It was her stepmother, right?

06:10.282 --> 06:12.110
Her natural parents are dead..

06:12.197 --> 06:14.678
and for some reason her
stepmother called

06:14.765 --> 06:16.724
a bunch of times that day.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.813
Did Kristin tell you
what it was about?

06:18.900 --> 06:21.555
- No.
- No.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.774
No. I...I was surprised.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.037
I thought they were estranged.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.276
What was your relationship
to Kristin, Mr. Batson?

06:47.363 --> 06:50.105
Oh, please. Please. We know
where you're going with this.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.585
- Melinda--
- No.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.152
Let's just haul the trash
out in the open.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.677
You want to know if she and
Elliott were sleeping together.

06:56.764 --> 06:57.765
Were you?

06:57.852 --> 07:00.724
Never. It's a rumor.
That's all.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.031
Rumors usually happen
for a reason.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.989
- Well..
- I'll give you the reason.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.817
Politics.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.254
You want to take a female
politician down a few notches?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.256
Throw mud on her marriage.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.490
Where were you the night
Kristin was killed?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.187
Here. I was
on a conference call.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.755
With a trade delegation
from Taiwan.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.888
We talked until after 11:00.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.630
I was with him
the whole time.

07:36.717 --> 07:41.373
[clears throat]
We'll be married
three years this October and..

07:41.461 --> 07:45.682
...today's news excepted, uh,
we've never been happier.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.381
That's hard to believe.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.341
What does that mean?

07:52.428 --> 07:53.603
Well, there's nothing going on

07:53.690 --> 07:55.605
between you right now.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.259
Excuse me. What?

07:57.346 --> 08:00.480
I'm sorry. I-I meant sexually.
No heat. Right?

08:04.266 --> 08:06.181
I think we're done here.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.229
[Jane]
'You'd think a politician
would have thicker skin.'

08:11.316 --> 08:13.493
You accused them of lying
about their sex life

08:13.580 --> 08:14.972
and you're surprised
they're upset?

08:15.059 --> 08:17.322
Oh, come on.
You're buying that happy talk?

08:17.409 --> 08:19.107
Really? Uh-oh.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.762
- Agent Minelli, sir.
- Agent Lisbon.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.154
I asked him down.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.330
Uh, Walter Crew,
Melinda Batson's dad.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.637
You're agents, uh,
Jane and Lisbon?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.204
- Yeah, we are. Hi.
- Hi.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.814
Sorry to track
you down like this.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.512
I asked Virgil here
to introduce me to the team

08:32.599 --> 08:35.819
handling the poor
Marley girl's case.

08:35.906 --> 08:39.127
Walter has been a friend
of the CBI for some time.

08:39.214 --> 08:42.826
He was an extremely influential
legislator for what, 20 years?

08:42.913 --> 08:45.089
Twenty six, but who's counting?

08:45.176 --> 08:47.918
Anyway, I'm old news now.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.617
The only thing I lobby for
is a good tee time.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.097
Why the interest
in the poor Marley girl's case?

08:53.184 --> 08:55.230
Interest? I liked her.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.885
Yeah, met her
in Melinda's office.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.844
She was good people.
Came from a tough background.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.585
'Didn't let that stop her.'

09:02.672 --> 09:04.282
I know how difficult it is
to get straight answers

09:04.369 --> 09:06.284
from the people
in that building there.

09:06.371 --> 09:09.418
If you have any problems,
you just let me know.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.986
- I can still knock heads.
- Oh, we'll be fine.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.814
Just let me know.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.946
- Virgil.
- Walter.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.644
- Take care.
- 'Sir.'

09:20.298 --> 09:23.563
I hate walks, Lisbon. I know
they're healthy. I don't care.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.434
Put me in a chair,
I'm a happy man.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.218
But when Walter Crew
asked me to stroll with him

09:27.305 --> 09:29.786
down to the Capitol,
I say, "Of course, Walter."

09:29.873 --> 09:31.483
- You get my drift?
- I do.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.399
Step carefully.
I want daily reports.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.401
Oh, and, uh, how did
the Batson interview go?

09:36.488 --> 09:39.187
- Oh, that was very exciting.
- What did he do?

09:39.274 --> 09:41.319
Nothing that can't be repaired.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.471
[Carmen]
'Teresa, nice of you
to drop by.'

10:02.558 --> 10:04.342
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.693
Late is an interesting word
in this context.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.912
You were
supposed to be here..

10:08.999 --> 10:10.871
...forty two minutes ago.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.568
I know. The point is,
I'm here now.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.918
We're supposed to talk,
so let's talk.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.138
I have another patient
scheduled in eight minutes.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.618
I can talk fast.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.231
This is the third time
you've been late.

10:23.318 --> 10:26.626
What can I say?
Lot of people getting killed.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.628
Can I get a coffee?

10:30.064 --> 10:31.195
[sighs]

10:34.155 --> 10:37.419
Do you know why
counseling is mandatory

10:37.506 --> 10:40.074
for CBI agents who've been
involved in a shooting?

10:40.161 --> 10:43.468
Because nobody would come
if it was voluntary?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.949
And that's why
it remains mandatory..

10:46.036 --> 10:48.996
...until I sign
and file this form.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.524
- See you next week.
- This is unnecessary.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.700
I'm fine.
I'm not traumatized.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.050
A man pointed a gun at you.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.704
A man who intended
to kill you.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.401
Fortunately,
Jane shot him first.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.186
It doesn't matter.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.145
You went from thinking
you were going to be killed..

11:08.232 --> 11:09.930
'...to watching a man die.'

11:10.017 --> 11:12.584
Two of the most wrenching
experiences we can have.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.934
And you went
through them in seconds.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.500
You don't think
that affected you?

11:15.587 --> 11:17.546
No.

11:17.633 --> 11:21.071
You really want to keep
seeing me, don't you?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.465
Next week...on time.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.599
Fine.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.784
Wow.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.699
There's a stain on the ceiling
that looks like Elvis

11:39.786 --> 11:43.528
but today it looks
more like a...basset hound.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.792
Someone call the media.
It's a miracle.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.576
Or maybe
someone's moved my couch.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.839
Cho.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.406
Did you move my couch?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.843
No. Why would I?

11:53.930 --> 11:56.193
Excuse me.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.369
Did you move the couch?

11:58.456 --> 12:01.111
[foreign accent]
I had to, uh,
change a light. Problem?

12:01.198 --> 12:03.548
No, no, no. Can you help me
move it back, please?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.468
I got a thing, I...thanks.

12:10.555 --> 12:14.255
Just up there.
I think it's this way.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.735
Just a little.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.390
[grunts]
That's it.
Let me just try..

12:21.958 --> 12:23.394
Perfect. Thank you.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.788
Elvis is back.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.659
Anything on the stepmom?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
Her name is Charlotte McAdoo.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.054
She called Kristin 11 times

12:31.141 --> 12:32.795
in the two days
before she disappeared.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.231
Any idea what that was about?

12:34.318 --> 12:35.537
No, but her son Harlan
had been picked up

12:35.624 --> 12:36.886
on a carjacking charge.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.540
He posted bail
the day Kristin disappeared.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.150
'Claimed he had nothing
to do with the carjacking.'

12:40.237 --> 12:41.761
'Said he was with Kristin
when it happened.'

12:41.848 --> 12:44.807
He used Kristin as his alibi?
How bad is Harlan?

12:44.894 --> 12:46.940
Well, mostly car theft,
some assault.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.332
What did Charlotte
have to say about that?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.812
She won't answer her phone,
won't call back.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.075
We're heading out
to talk to her.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.208
Shouldn't we be looking
for Kristin's lover?

12:54.295 --> 12:56.340
Who? Elliott Batson's alibi
checked out

12:56.427 --> 12:58.734
and there's no sign
she was seeing someone else.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.345
- 'We've checked.'
- Well, not enough.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.651
She was an immature romantic

13:02.738 --> 13:05.175
looking for escape
and adventure.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.481
She was having an affair.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.831
We searched
her place thoroughly.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.050
She kept the affair well hidden.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.878
Well, of course.

13:11.965 --> 13:15.446
It's an adventure
because it's a secret.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.580
But I expect
she'll tell us who it was.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.669
I'll bite. How?

13:20.756 --> 13:22.671
[clears throat]
Check this out.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.195
She was a collector.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.459
She kept sand from every
beach she ever went to.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.375
She would have kept a memento
of her lover, something small.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.769
I bet she kept it in
a fancy jewelry box

13:33.856 --> 13:35.815
the kind with a figurine
on the lid.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.208
There was a fancy jewelry box
like that in her bedroom.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.689
- A ballerina.
- Ballerina. She's the type.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.822
But we checked it. There's
nothing in it but cheap jewelry.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.302
Did you check
in the secret compartment?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.956
The secret compartment
either on the bottom

13:47.043 --> 13:50.264
or one of the sides.
They usually have one.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.222
It's worth taking a look.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.441
Fine.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.882
Forget about Bosco.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.235
[Jane]
'He's got something.'

14:05.322 --> 14:06.976
Yeah, he's got Red John,
and we don't.

14:07.063 --> 14:10.240
No. No, he's got something new
on the case. New evidence.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.068
How can you tell?

14:12.155 --> 14:13.983
It's clear as can be.
I'll be right back.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.333
Jane, Red John
belongs to Bosco now.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.727
I don't like it either, but
you'll have to deal with it.

14:18.814 --> 14:22.470
Do you want a coffee?
I'm gonna bring you a coffee.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.479
I need copies of each of these
sent over to division.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.220
'What's he doing in there?'

14:33.307 --> 14:34.743
He said you told him
to wait in there.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.919
[sighs]
We'll finish later.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.706
- Get away from my desk.
- Where'dyougo?

14:41.793 --> 14:43.012
I've been here
almost half an hour.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
And stop hacking my passcodes

14:45.232 --> 14:46.581
and stop hustling my people.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.409
It's not doing you
any good, you know.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.541
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:50.628 --> 14:53.022
What'd you get on Red John?

14:53.109 --> 14:54.806
And what makes you think
I got anything?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.417
Folder.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.246
You moved it
when you saw me, protected it.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.988
It's the one thing
you'd protect from me.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.990
It's the cover-up
that gave you away.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.948
- Huh.
- What is it?

15:06.035 --> 15:10.561
It's none
of your business, so go.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.781
You need
to understand something.

15:12.868 --> 15:15.566
Red John doesn't make mistakes.
He doesn't leave clues.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.265
If you have new evidence, it's
because he wants you to have it.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.919
The question
isn't what does it mean?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.921
It's why did he give it to you?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.183
That's deep.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.402
Tell me what it is.
I can help you.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.882
Have you ever seen
a crack addict

15:26.969 --> 15:28.536
when they're begging for a hit?

15:28.623 --> 15:30.668
You got that same look
in your eye that they get.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.584
Oh. You've got me
all figured out.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.717
[cell phone rings]

15:35.804 --> 15:37.762
Hey, Van Pelt.
Did you get it?

15:37.849 --> 15:40.330
There's a secret compartment,
just like you said.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.855
- And what was in it?
- Nothing. It's empty.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.988
Huh...alright.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.166
Bad news, huh?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.212
No, not at all.

15:52.299 --> 15:55.650
It's like you said, it's
the cover-up that gave you away.

15:55.737 --> 15:59.001
You're an addict, Jane.
You need help.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.004
- You're making a mistake.
- You can go.

16:14.843 --> 16:15.800
[Rigsby]
I got tickets to the Kings game
tomorrow night. You wanna go?

16:15.887 --> 16:17.628
- I'm going out.
- Who with?

16:17.715 --> 16:19.935
The niece of that shopkeeper
we met on that Red John thing.

16:20.022 --> 16:23.939
Oh, finally.
Took you long enough.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.376
- 5B?
- Yeah.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.030
Well, we talked on the phone.
She's nice.

16:28.117 --> 16:31.120
- We'll see how it goes.
- I expect a full report.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.775
- In your dreams.
- Hey, I got you that number.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.820
- You owe me.
- No.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.999
- Charlotte McAdoo?
- Yeah.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.304
We need to talk to you
about your stepdaughter

16:41.391 --> 16:42.523
Kristin Marley.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.575
You know that Kristin's dead,
right, Charlotte?

16:51.662 --> 16:52.924
What about it?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.188
I guess
you're pretty broken up.

16:55.275 --> 16:58.582
She wasn't my kid. I'm not
the huggy type. Sue me.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.280
If you didn't like Kristin
why'd you make all those calls

17:00.367 --> 17:02.630
right before she disappeared?

17:02.717 --> 17:05.589
- Don't remember.
- It was a week ago.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.331
I'm old.
My memory's bad.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.680
Did it have something to do
with your son Harlan?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.465
What about Harlan?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.945
He used Kristin as an alibi
when he was arrested.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.382
But Kristin told Sacramento PD

17:15.469 --> 17:17.558
she hadn't seen Harlan
for months.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.038
Were you asking Kristin
to change her story

17:19.125 --> 17:20.778
and lie an alibi
for her stepbrother?

17:20.865 --> 17:22.345
No, that's crazy.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.260
- Where is Harlan?
- 'I don't know.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.436
'I haven't seen him for days.'

17:26.523 --> 17:29.961
Okay. Thanks for your time.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.746
That's...that's it?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.835
We'll see ourselves out.
Thank you.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.932
[whispers]
You think Charlotte
smokes filtered and unfiltered?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
Not if she's got a visitor.
Bathroom or closet?

17:45.890 --> 17:47.327
- Bathroom.
- I think closet.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.937
- You wanna bet?
- What do I get if I win?

17:49.024 --> 17:50.243
I pay for lunch next week.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.245
I win, you tell me
about your date.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.855
That's enough time.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.598
- Hey, Harlan.
- Oh, crap.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.991
Harlan, were you
in the bathroom or the closet?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.602
- Closet. Wh--
- I told you.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.908
- We didn't bet.
- Yes, we did.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.002
No law against
being in a closet.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.961
No, Harlan, but it is
kinda suspicious.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.663
- You got no right to hold me.
- We're just talking.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.320
Alright, what do you
want to talk about?

18:24.407 --> 18:27.889
Kristin Marley,
when did you see her last?

18:27.976 --> 18:30.065
- What happened to her?
- You tell us.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.676
Well, I got nothing to say
about her.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.200
You must be mad that
she didn't back your alibi

18:34.287 --> 18:36.419
on the carjacking charge, huh?

18:36.506 --> 18:40.815
First of all...that arrest
was completely bogus.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.991
And, B, that stuck-up bitch
don't get

18:43.078 --> 18:44.514
what the word family means, so..

18:44.601 --> 18:45.863
What is that?

18:45.950 --> 18:48.214
Family's supposed to help
when you're down.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.737
But she gets a job
in the Capitol

18:49.824 --> 18:51.521
with some big money friends,
and pow

18:51.608 --> 18:54.220
she's too good
for the people she grew up with.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.092
She don't get what the word
family is all about, you know?

18:57.179 --> 19:00.965
Didn't. She's dead.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.011
Yeah.

19:03.098 --> 19:06.101
That's too bad.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.972
Did you have
any contact with Kristin

19:08.059 --> 19:09.496
after you posted bail, Harlan?

19:09.583 --> 19:10.975
- No.
- None?

19:11.062 --> 19:12.368
That's what I said.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.804
It's funny,
'cause our tech guys

19:13.891 --> 19:15.066
have been going through
her cell phone.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.678
There's some deleted
texts on it.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.594
Four of them were from you
the day she disappeared.

19:20.681 --> 19:24.946
Well, that's what you call
a-a glitch, computer thing.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.036
You were threatening Kristin to
get her to lie for you, right?

19:28.123 --> 19:31.387
- Didn't say that.
- I could see why you'd do it.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.433
You're facing serious time.

19:34.825 --> 19:38.351
You arresting me?

19:38.438 --> 19:39.830
You got no right
to hold me if you ain't.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.876
You're not under arrest.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.704
But you are out on bail,
and that can be revoked

19:43.791 --> 19:46.359
if the judge thinks
you're not being cooperative.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.448
Do you want a soda, Harlan?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.321
I want chips.

19:56.717 --> 20:00.024
If he took Kristin's body to the
bridge, he put her in his trunk.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.026
It's worth taking a look.
I'll call the district attorney.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.593
If Harlan hears
we're looking at his car

20:03.680 --> 20:07.162
he'll be out the door before
the warrant comes through.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.729
We're gonna make him
want to stay.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.209
'Van Pelt.'

20:12.994 --> 20:14.952
You're taking over
the McAdoo interview.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.304
I'm totally ready for that. I
can get him to confess to this.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.044
Yeah, maybe.

20:20.131 --> 20:22.090
The main thing is, you keep
him in there long enough

20:22.177 --> 20:24.527
for us to search his car.
Be friendly.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.095
He thinks he's a player.
He'll eat it up.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.010
What do you mean,
be friendly?

20:29.097 --> 20:30.620
Need a map?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.014
Good luck.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.765
Hey...I heard Bosco cleaned
your clock this morning.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.898
Well, that's one interpretation.

20:47.985 --> 20:51.293
I get it. It's tough to have
Red John taken away like that.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.729
Bet you'd give a lot
to know

20:52.816 --> 20:54.775
what they're saying
in Bosco's office.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.431
Yeah.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.131
Yeah, I would.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.828
You gotta let it go, man.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.569
Forget about the jewelry box.
You missed one.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.006
- So what?
- Actually, I didn't.

21:09.093 --> 21:12.009
I'm pursuing an independent
line of investigation.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.925
Gonna crack
this case in 24 hours.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.667
I think we might be
ahead of you this time.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.770
Hi, Harlan.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.729
I'm agent Van Pelt.

21:35.816 --> 21:39.428
Special agent Lisbon asked me
to take over the interview.

21:39.515 --> 21:40.560
Why?

21:40.647 --> 21:43.084
She's busy
with something else.

21:45.304 --> 21:50.309
So I've looked through
your file and it's, uh..

21:50.396 --> 21:53.050
...it's very..

21:53.137 --> 21:54.574
What?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.793
Well..

21:56.880 --> 22:00.449
I don't think you had
anything to do with this crime.

22:00.536 --> 22:03.191
Thank you.
That's what I've been saying.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.454
It's just a big
misunderstanding, I'm sure.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.022
Yeah. You got that right.

22:08.109 --> 22:12.896
But let's fill out the forms,
so everyone's happy, okay?

22:12.983 --> 22:14.724
Mmm. Chips.

22:15.725 --> 22:16.857
[crunching]

22:18.641 --> 22:21.252
So...let's make a time line

22:21.340 --> 22:23.864
of everywhere you've been
since Kristin disappeared.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.126
Okay.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.217
- You want another?
- Mm.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.415
[doorbell rings]

22:58.551 --> 23:00.204
[Jane]
'These all pictures
of your daughter?'

23:00.291 --> 23:01.989
[Walter]
'Yes, they are.'

23:02.076 --> 23:03.120
[Jane]
'Well, it's surprising
there's not more'

23:03.207 --> 23:05.296
'pictures of you.'

23:05.384 --> 23:07.037
Given your standing, that is.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.866
What, me talking
to a bunch of famous windbags?

23:09.953 --> 23:12.739
Had those. Took 'em down.
Waste of space.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.263
- Thank you.
- No, my days are over.

23:15.350 --> 23:18.048
Melinda has got the future.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.487
She could go far, very far,
if she listens to me.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.446
Now what did you want
to talk about?

23:26.535 --> 23:27.667
[sighs]

23:29.408 --> 23:31.105
How long were you sleeping
with Kristin Marley

23:31.192 --> 23:33.281
before she was killed?

23:33.368 --> 23:36.632
[scoffs]
What makes you think I was?

23:36.719 --> 23:39.461
You're a politician.
Ambitious. Narcissistic.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.071
Addicted to the love
of strangers.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.117
She was beautiful,
impressionable

23:43.204 --> 23:45.641
no doubt flattered
by your attentions.

23:45.728 --> 23:46.990
And you're not
the sort of man

23:47.077 --> 23:50.472
to deny yourself
an object of desire.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.648
I'm married 38 years, Mr. Jane.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.041
[chuckles]

23:54.128 --> 23:56.304
As I said.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.872
Uh, even if
what you say is true

23:58.959 --> 24:02.136
and I'm not saying it is

24:02.223 --> 24:05.835
what does that have to do
with poor Kristin's murder?

24:05.922 --> 24:08.055
Blackmail or something like it.

24:10.144 --> 24:13.060
The business adultery leads to.

24:13.147 --> 24:17.412
Ah...but...even if I am

24:17.499 --> 24:20.241
what you say I am and..

24:20.328 --> 24:22.112
...I'm not saying I am..

24:22.199 --> 24:24.898
...wouldn't I have faced
a situation like this before..

24:24.985 --> 24:28.075
...and handled it
without killing anybody?

24:28.162 --> 24:29.598
- It's a good point.
- 'Mm.'

24:29.685 --> 24:32.253
- I'll think about that.
- Please.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.038
Mm.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.171
Anything else?

24:37.258 --> 24:39.216
What? Mm? Sorry?

24:39.303 --> 24:42.306
Well, whoever it is, I'll have
the killer by the morning.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.874
So, uh, you should act
accordingly.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.963
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.793
[instrumental music]

24:52.795 --> 24:55.537
[Cho]
You think Harlan
ever cleans out his car?

24:55.624 --> 24:57.670
So where you taking the
shopkeeper's niece for dinner?

24:57.757 --> 24:58.845
I'd rather not talk about it.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.716
- Why not?
- It's private.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.849
Oh, come on.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.329
Let's talk about somethin' else.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.722
I'll call technical services.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.158
They can pop that lock
in 20 seconds.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.551
It'll take 'em
two hours to get here.

25:09.638 --> 25:10.813
It took you two hours
to open the door

25:10.900 --> 25:11.858
last time you tried this
and we had to pay

25:11.945 --> 25:12.859
for the busted window.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.165
Fluke.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.732
If I had a date,
I'd tell you about it.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.342
[scoffs]
Yeah.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.344
I would tell you anything
you wanted to know.

25:20.431 --> 25:23.870
Okay, you ever gonna man up
and make a move on Van Pelt?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.350
- Fine. Don't tell me.
- Right.

25:31.791 --> 25:32.922
[grunts]

25:40.800 --> 25:42.497
Hey. Check this out.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.152
Wasn't the other one of these
on Kristin Marley's foot?

25:45.239 --> 25:46.588
I'll call Lisbon.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.988
Kristin's shoe was
in your trunk.

25:55.075 --> 25:58.295
No. No way.
Uh-uh.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.559
You want to tell us
how it got there, Harlan?

26:00.646 --> 26:03.170
I don't know.
Maybe you put it there, huh?

26:03.257 --> 26:06.303
You have no alibi for the night
of Kristin's disappearance.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.523
I told you.
I was with my mom.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.526
She was concealing you
when we went to pick you up.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.572
- It's not gonna cut it.
- You were mad at Kristin.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.443
- A little, but--
- You threatened her.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.662
No.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.318
Okay, I mean, a-a little,
but come on.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.799
I-I wouldn't hurt her for real.

26:23.886 --> 26:27.150
That's not much
of a story, Harlan.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.978
[whispers]
I thought you believed me.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.851
You were wrong.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.593
[chuckles]
You know what? The hell
with this. I'm outta here.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.942
Not quite yet.

26:36.029 --> 26:39.728
- Oh, you're gonna stop me?
- Yeah.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.295
- Did you make the arrest?
- I did.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.819
Ah, victory is yours.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.212
Yes, it is.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.824
What?

26:48.911 --> 26:50.043
Oh, nothing.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.828
- Come on.
- No. No.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.221
I'm still waiting.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.530
Throwing the body off
the bridge was a smart move.

26:59.618 --> 27:04.057
Good chance the coroner
would declare it a suicide.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.362
Do you really think
Harlan McAdoo

27:05.449 --> 27:06.929
would come up with that?

27:07.016 --> 27:09.279
Dumb people can come up
with smart ideas

27:09.366 --> 27:11.804
and smart people
can come up with dumb ones.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.588
Eh, true.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.897
I'll have the real killer
here in 12 hours or so.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.464
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see. Bye.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.552
Jane.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.553
Hey, boss, you want me to send

27:22.641 --> 27:25.774
McAdoo down to be arraigned?

27:25.861 --> 27:27.036
Not yet. Sit on him.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.385
See if he comes up
with something useful

27:28.472 --> 27:30.039
once he calms down.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.784
Well, obviously,
you've got to get it out of

27:35.871 --> 27:37.351
committee before..

27:37.438 --> 27:40.746
- Mr. Jane.
- Hi. Don't mind me.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.617
What are you doing?

27:42.704 --> 27:46.447
- Hard at work, on the case.
- I don't understand.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.102
We got a call from agent Minelli
saying that an arrest

27:49.189 --> 27:50.799
had been made,
Kristin's stepbrother.

27:50.886 --> 27:54.237
Nope, nope, nope. Wrong guy.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.239
How can that be?

27:56.326 --> 27:59.982
Simple miscarriage of justice,
happens all the time.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.244
What does that mean?

28:01.331 --> 28:04.030
It means I have to find
the real killer.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.336
The real killer? How?

28:06.423 --> 28:08.077
Oh, Kristin was a collector.

28:08.164 --> 28:12.995
Ergo, the identity of Kristin's
killer will be in her things.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.257
How can you be sure
it's there?

28:14.344 --> 28:15.781
Oh, I'm sure.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.434
Mr. Jane, this isn't acceptable.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.653
First you accost my father--

28:18.740 --> 28:20.089
Oh, I wouldn't use
the word accost.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.656
And now you're
ransacking my office.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.223
- Calm down, Melinda.
- I won't calm down.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.746
I thought
we'd put this behind us.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.617
Not much
of a campaign slogan.

28:26.705 --> 28:31.144
"Batson, so tough on crime, she
puts the innocent behind bars."

28:34.147 --> 28:36.627
Do what you have to do.
W-we'll help in any way we can.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.761
Great. Thank you. There's
a couple of boxes right there.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.416
If you could just,
uh, grab one each

28:42.503 --> 28:44.418
and follow me to my car.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.469
[Minelli]
'Lisbon, didn't you arrest
McAdoo?'

28:52.556 --> 28:54.123
[Lisbon]
'Yeah, we did.'

28:54.210 --> 28:55.864
DA says you haven't
sent him down to be arraigned.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.779
We've 48 hours to do that.
We still have some loose ends.

28:57.866 --> 29:00.956
- What, what loose ends? Him?
- No.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.785
What are you doing?
No, don't tell me.

29:03.872 --> 29:07.441
I want this off my desk.
Get McAdoo to the DA tonight.

29:07.528 --> 29:10.096
How hard is Crew
leaning on you?

29:10.183 --> 29:11.967
- He's not.
- Then who's doing it for him?

29:12.054 --> 29:13.882
- No one.
- Is this my case, sir?

29:13.969 --> 29:15.754
Yes, but--

29:15.841 --> 29:17.843
Then it's my decision
as to when the suspect is

29:17.930 --> 29:21.020
handed over to
the District Attorney, right?

29:21.107 --> 29:22.761
If McAdoo isn't
in the DA's office

29:22.848 --> 29:24.153
first thing tomorrow morning..

29:24.240 --> 29:26.677
...this becomes
a different conversation.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.595
[sighs]

29:31.682 --> 29:34.903
- You won't regret this.
- I already do.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.473
[cricket chirping]

29:58.013 --> 29:59.667
[phone rings]

29:59.754 --> 30:01.060
[Lisbon]
'Hey, this is Lisbon.'

30:01.147 --> 30:02.888
'Leave a message.
I'll call you back.'

30:02.975 --> 30:04.063
[beep]

30:04.150 --> 30:06.152
I found what I was looking for.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.023
I don't want to risk taking it
out of the office

30:08.110 --> 30:10.983
so I'm gonna put it in the top
right hand drawer of your desk.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.941
When you get this, call me.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.430
[door opens]

30:47.715 --> 30:50.587
"Ah ha."

30:50.674 --> 30:53.634
[foreign accent]
Oh. Y-you startled me.
Uh..

30:54.983 --> 30:58.682
I'll...I'll just
get out of your way.

30:58.769 --> 31:03.078
- Stand still. Turn around.
- Huh? Whoa. Whoa.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.514
What is this?

31:04.601 --> 31:06.647
Who are you
and who are you working for?

31:06.734 --> 31:11.043
I work for the building.
I clean. I clean.

31:11.130 --> 31:15.482
Oh, you're not a cleaner.
Look at this place. It's a mess.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.092
You're the fixer.

31:17.179 --> 31:21.140
You've been listening in
on our conversations.

31:21.227 --> 31:24.099
Huh? What's that? That's one
of the bugs you placed.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.754
I found it
in the overhead light.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.757
When I told Van Pelt to go
and check out the jewelry box

31:29.844 --> 31:31.933
you overheard
and you went there first.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.675
And it was you that placed
the shoe in McAdoo's trunk.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.808
- I'm on the cleaning crew.
- Oh, really?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.899
I'm new.
You can call my supervisor.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.465
'Marty, uh..'

31:42.552 --> 31:45.468
Marty, uh, Toretta, huh?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.124
- Call him up right now.
- No.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.778
Wake him up.

31:53.607 --> 31:56.305
I got no idea
what you're talking about here.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.046
We're talking about
accessory to murder

31:58.133 --> 32:00.396
conspiracy, obstruction.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.268
'Who hired you?'

32:02.355 --> 32:04.835
Murder?

32:04.923 --> 32:07.316
Oh, I-I don't feel too good.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.753
- Can I sit? Can I--
- Oh, take a seat.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.972
Thanks.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.368
[American accent]
Alright. Oh, no, no. No.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.849
- Calm. Are you calm?
- Sure.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.724
Alright, now, I want you
to lift your gun out

32:23.811 --> 32:26.770
with two fingers
and slide it across the floor.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.823
Now, get your cuffs.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.825
This isn't gonna work.

32:39.348 --> 32:41.916
The door.
Hook yourself up.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.491
Toss the keys.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.582
[keys jingle]

32:55.669 --> 32:59.673
Now you and I are
gonna walk out here.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.631
Sure.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.851
It's a little stroll.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.288
[indistinct radio chatter,
door opens]

33:10.031 --> 33:11.337
[door squeaking]

33:16.603 --> 33:18.779
Find out where he goes.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.695
- Uh, no, I think--
- Go, now. Go.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.740
Oh.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.396
- Ma'am.
- Keys, please.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.007
There. Yeah.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.282
[tires screeching]

33:54.293 --> 33:56.686
[intense music]

34:25.759 --> 34:27.065
[footsteps approaching]

34:29.806 --> 34:34.202
So, Agent Lisbon, here we are.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.465
What's this about?

34:36.552 --> 34:38.380
This is Art Cavalleri.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.643
He's the private investigator
one of you hired

34:40.730 --> 34:42.906
to wiretap and obstruct
our investigation.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.343
Really?

34:44.430 --> 34:46.867
He's agreed to talk in exchange
for leniency.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.261
'I called you down here
to offer you the same deal.'

34:49.348 --> 34:51.306
Well, that's very nice of you.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.786
You can discuss it
with my attorney.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.657
- Melinda?
- I have nothing to say.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.530
Even if you had nothing to do
with Kristin Marley's murder..

34:57.617 --> 34:59.097
'...with what Cavalleri
is saying'

34:59.184 --> 35:00.750
'about the conspiracy
and the cover up'

35:00.837 --> 35:02.535
you're all gonna do
a lot of time in prison.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.799
- I don't need to hear anymore.
- W-wait. I-I do.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.453
What kind of leniency
are we talking about here?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.672
- Elliott.
- Depends, Mr. Batson.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.021
What do you know?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.806
I need an assurance
that any charges

35:12.893 --> 35:14.460
related to the murder
will be dropped.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.722
You got it, as long
as you didn't have

35:15.809 --> 35:17.071
anything to do with the murder.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
If you'll excuse us,
I want some private time

35:19.204 --> 35:20.640
with my family right now.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.164
Mr. Crew, stay there.
Go on.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.559
[Jane]
'Oh, come on.
Spit it out, man.'

35:26.646 --> 35:29.649
The marriage is a sham.
She's gay. You're the beard.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.217
It was kind of obvious
from the start.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.828
I had an arrangement
with Melinda Elliott.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.046
Don't.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.222
I agreed to marry Melinda

35:37.309 --> 35:39.311
in exchange for..

35:39.398 --> 35:40.877
'...certain
financial considerations.'

35:40.964 --> 35:42.357
Batson, we had a deal.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.054
Did that deal
include time in prison?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.665
I-I don't think so.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.493
So it was your own people
that started the rumor

35:47.580 --> 35:50.496
about you and Kristin to hide
her affair with Melinda.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.802
Yes.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.413
I'm sorry, Melinda.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.113
Kristin broke it off
shortly before she disappeared.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.811
Melinda was upset.

36:01.898 --> 36:05.641
And were you with Melinda
the night Kristin disappeared?

36:08.340 --> 36:10.994
No. I didn't see her
until late that night.

36:11.081 --> 36:14.389
She was...a mess.

36:14.476 --> 36:15.956
But she wouldn't
tell me what had happened.

36:16.043 --> 36:18.306
Kristin had something
hidden in her apartment.

36:18.393 --> 36:21.918
- A...memento, I guess.
- Lovers' memento.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.835
Cavalleri had found it,
but we took it out of his car.

36:25.922 --> 36:28.969
It could be a W,
but I think it's an M.

36:36.063 --> 36:39.153
'You and your father were both
having an affair with Kristin.'

36:39.240 --> 36:40.459
No.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.159
No.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.727
- I--
- Melinda.

36:47.814 --> 36:51.296
Ihad a relationship
with Kristin.

36:51.383 --> 36:54.124
Heseduced her.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.475
Took her..

36:56.562 --> 36:58.433
...the way he's taken women
his whole life.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.784
- I was trying to make a point.
- You were what?

37:01.871 --> 37:03.395
- I was trying to show you--
- What?

37:03.482 --> 37:04.961
That she was just another girl.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.876
That she was just
another trashy little girl.

37:06.963 --> 37:11.533
You thought you were in love,
but she was just having a fling.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.927
He believed that
you were giving away

37:14.014 --> 37:17.626
a very bright political career
because of some strumpet.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.933
What happened that night?

37:26.635 --> 37:28.463
Melinda,
every day you don't talk

37:28.550 --> 37:30.726
'is another day
you're on the news.'

37:36.776 --> 37:39.300
I knew Kristin
was seeing someone..

37:39.387 --> 37:42.172
...but I didn't know who it was.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.263
So I followed her..

37:47.700 --> 37:50.050
...and that's when
I saw my father.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.009
[exhales deeply]

37:53.096 --> 37:56.752
After he left,
I went into her apartment.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.064
She had these stone bookends.

38:05.674 --> 38:06.980
'I grabbed one.'

38:11.289 --> 38:14.204
Next thing I knew,
Kristin was on the floor.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.861
It just...happened.

38:26.565 --> 38:30.917
And then I did what
I always do when I'm in trouble.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.745
I called daddy.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.445
He said he knew someone
who could fix it.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.752
Ah, the fixer.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.104
You can let Cavalleri go now.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.497
[whispers]
Watch.

38:54.854 --> 38:57.335
Oh, my God.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.252
He's dead.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.344
Yeah.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.484
You abused a corpse
to get a confession.

39:16.571 --> 39:19.835
Used. Used a corpse.
There's no Ab.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.882
I'm appalled. I'm..

39:22.969 --> 39:24.797
I don't know what to say.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.581
Sir, it's not like
we killed him.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.496
His neck was broken
in the crash.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.673
- We got a confession.
- Suppose you didn't.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.241
Suppose you'd been wrong.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.243
Have you any idea
of the vastness

39:36.330 --> 39:38.463
of the crapstorm
that would follow?

39:38.550 --> 39:40.290
It would blot out the sun.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.423
Sir, Crew and Batson
manipulated us

39:42.510 --> 39:44.251
into arresting
the wrong person.

39:44.338 --> 39:47.385
They bugged our offices
and subverted our case.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.474
I don't think we did
anything wrong.

39:49.561 --> 39:50.779
I think
we should be commended.

39:50.866 --> 39:53.434
[scoffs]

39:53.521 --> 39:55.784
Congratulations. You finally
got her to drink the Kool-Aid.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.660
Check yourself, agent.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.141
All of you.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.364
Well, I thought
that went pretty well.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.061
Great. Yeah.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.847
Highlight for me
was definitely your speech.

40:14.934 --> 40:18.894
Passionate. Articulate. Strong.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.243
Whatever.

40:21.331 --> 40:22.463
Hmm.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.822
Hey, good work with McAdoo,
you know, keeping him here.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.476
Yeah.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.348
You know...if boss
had given me a chance

40:38.436 --> 40:39.741
I think I could have
gotten him to confess.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.396
Sure, if he wasn't,
you know, innocent.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.658
If it wasn't
for that small fact

40:43.745 --> 40:45.834
I'm sure you'd have
taken him to town.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.750
Thanks.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.709
You have any plans
for tonight?

40:50.796 --> 40:52.754
Home. TV.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.104
Well...have fun.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.455
You, too.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.372
You're gonna die alone.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.553
- 'Uh, sir..'
- Morning.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.815
Sir, you can't go in there.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.382
No, it's okay.
I come in peace.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.647
- Great color on you.
- Y-you..

41:15.734 --> 41:18.780
- Go away.
- Just give me a minute, please.

41:18.867 --> 41:22.218
I-I want you, and I want your
team to know...that I got it.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.046
I got the message.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.483
I got it.

41:27.136 --> 41:31.489
The Red John case...belongs
to you.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.317
- You're gonna leave us alone?
- Yeah, that's right.

41:34.404 --> 41:37.625
- I don't believe that.
- I bought you doughnuts.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.975
'The international
law enforcement'

41:40.062 --> 41:41.803
symbol of friendship.

41:43.370 --> 41:46.504
I-I am trusting you
to catch Red John.

41:49.376 --> 41:52.292
I'm counting on it.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.990
We will catch him.
Thanks.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.516
Good hunting.

42:01.388 --> 42:03.956
Hicks, take that away.
Take it far away.

42:04.043 --> 42:06.567
Take it out of the building.
God knows what he put in there.

42:06.654 --> 42:08.177
You got it.

42:08.264 --> 42:10.615
Alright, let's go over
the most recent forensics.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.355
There are two short,
linear incised wounds

42:12.442 --> 42:14.140
that are extremely superficial.

42:14.227 --> 42:17.186
'They involve the anterior
surface of the right wrist'

42:17.273 --> 42:19.885
'which measures 0.8 inches.'

42:25.499 --> 42:27.240
[male #2]
'Okay, you got it.

42:27.327 --> 42:28.807
[Bosco]
'Don't tell the local guys
what it's for.'

42:28.894 --> 42:30.678
[male #2]
'Yeah, no worries.'

42:30.765 --> 42:32.550
[Bosco]
'Just say you're following up
on something.'

42:32.637 --> 42:34.769
'I want to keep this
on the down low for now.'

42:34.856 --> 42:38.077
'Now, what else did you get
from handwriting analysis?'

42:38.164 --> 42:40.906
[male #3]
'We've had two guys look at it.
One local, one from DC.'

42:40.993 --> 42:43.691
'And of course, they agree
on pretty much nothing.'

42:43.778 --> 42:47.129
[Bosco chuckles]
'Figures.
What did the DC Guysay?'

42:55.921 --> 42:56.617
[theme music]
