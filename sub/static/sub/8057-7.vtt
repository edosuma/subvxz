WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.639
2020.

00:02.735 --> 00:04.545
Uh, that's a stretch.

00:04.804 --> 00:06.715
Fine, 2024.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.446
I win.
We move in there.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.883
I'll take the West Wing.
You take the East Wing.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.686
You can be
the First Gentleman.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.120
Actually, that sounds kind of great.
(CHUCKLES)

00:16.483 --> 00:18.224
Thanks for coming
with me to get my stuff.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.025
How can I pass up an opportunity
to look at our future house?

00:22.355 --> 00:25.234
Oh, I just remembered. I kind of
got you an engagement present.

00:25.725 --> 00:26.931
Is it a waffle tower?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.029
I mean, it's a little
better than that.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.232
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

00:36.403 --> 00:39.247
(STUTTERS) That...
How did you do this?

00:39.372 --> 00:40.476
I called in
a few favors.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.575
Excuse me, here.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.582
A few hundred favors.

00:43.643 --> 00:44.747
Mr. Vice President.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.791
I'm Ben Wyatt from
Congressman Murray's office.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.723
Hey, Ben. Dave told me you
were going to be coming by.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.056
And you must be
Leslie Knope.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.790
Welcome. Welcome.
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

00:53.086 --> 00:56.829
(STAMMERING) You're... My name
just came out of your mouth.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.365
Well, yeah, it did.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.169
Well, this isn't happening.

01:01.327 --> 01:02.533
This isn't real.

01:02.595 --> 01:03.665
No, it's happening.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.767
I'm delighted
to have you here.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.675
On behalf of the
President and myself...

01:07.801 --> 01:10.008
Oh, Mr. Vice President,
lam deeply flattered.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.841
But there's no way
that I could take over

01:11.905 --> 01:13.816
Madam Secretary
Clinton's position.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.008
Imean...

01:15.075 --> 01:16.349
I'm confident
you could do that job

01:16.476 --> 01:18.513
or any other, but the reason...
Okay, I will.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.147
Well, the reason
you're here is,

01:20.213 --> 01:22.193
I'm told you've done
such a great job

01:22.248 --> 01:24.956
in your town and
the state of Indiana.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.430
And I just want to say congratulations
for your public service.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.063
I just want
to say thank you.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.432
(STAMMERING) Well, you're very welcome.
You're very welcome.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.698
Hey. You're very welcome.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
You're very handsome.
I think we're all done.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.134
Well, you're very nice.
But thank you.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.836
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:39.899 --> 01:40.934
Thank you very much.
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.344
Well...
Oh, well, you will?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.273
Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

01:46.339 --> 01:47.443
You're welcome.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.947
You don't let anything happen to him.
Do you understand me?

01:50.510 --> 01:52.353
He is precious cargo.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.899 --> 02:15.505
Yeah, it's actually the same accounting
firm I almost joined last year.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.309
I mean, they gave me
a great package.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.384
Three weeks of vacation,
matching 401K,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.044
and a pretty
sweet Windbreaker.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.143
Wow!

02:23.209 --> 02:26.918
I'm getting married, and I
wanted a good, stable job.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.687
So, I'm going back
to accounting.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.589
(IN DEEP VOICE)
So, just call me Bond.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.029
Municipal Bond.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.794
(CHUCKLES)

02:37.123 --> 02:39.160
Yeah, that joke killed
at the accounting firm.

02:39.559 --> 02:43.530
Well, well, well, if it isn't
Mr. Looks and Professor Books.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.132
He's Looks.
I got it.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.801
Of course you do, Books.
What's going on?

02:46.900 --> 02:47.935
Well, fun fact.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.379
Ben just got an amazing
accounting job.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.313
Regular fact. I have
to go to a meeting.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.477
Un-fun fact. 
My uncle just had a stroke.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.320
Well, I'm off.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.454
This is actually
a crazy coincidence.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.158
I have a new company

03:02.215 --> 03:04.456
and could use your help on
the math side of things.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.587
Oh! What's the new company?

03:05.985 --> 03:08.363
We specialize in making stacks
on stacks on stacks on stacks.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.990
Right. Pass.

03:10.056 --> 03:13.162
I'm kidding. It's a real idea.
So, get this.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.772
Kids are always growing
out of their clothes,

03:14.827 --> 03:16.864
so their parents don't want
to buy them nice things.

03:16.996 --> 03:19.704
I'm going to rent my upscale
clothing to middle school kids.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.970
Because I discovered

03:21.034 --> 03:23.810
I'm roughly the same size as the
average Pawnee 12-year-old.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.916
That's actually a really great idea.
I know.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.009
Can you take a look at the business
plan, tell me what you think?

03:28.074 --> 03:29.553
Sure, why not?
Awesome.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.847
Washington, D.C. has more dog parks
per capita than most cities.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.626
Pawnee only has
two dog parks,

03:36.683 --> 03:40.529
this one, and that one, which
is also an active parking lot.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.965
(Sums) can you say
"Per capita" again?

03:43.022 --> 03:44.592
I want to take a picture of
you saying "per capita."

03:44.657 --> 03:45.692
Stop.

03:45.758 --> 03:46.759
I am so proud of you.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.234
Now stand
next to the screen

03:48.294 --> 03:50.296
and think about all the strong
female role models in your life.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.364
Gross.
(CLICKS)

03:51.431 --> 03:55.277
April came to me with an idea
to build a dog park in Pawnee.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.871
I recognized her potential
a long time ago,

03:57.937 --> 03:59.712
and she's finally
living up to it.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.820
I mean, I am so proud
of her, I could cry.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.120
(TEARFULLY) And here we go.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.649
One tiny critique.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.318
If you do want
to be taken seriously,

04:09.449 --> 04:11.656
you might want to think a little bit
about how you present yourself.

04:11.851 --> 04:15.321
No, this is publicity for Orin's
new performance art show.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.523
He's an animal
living on a human farm

04:17.624 --> 04:19.661
and you can go and feed him
from your own hand.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.797
Ugh. That's horrifying,
and so is Orin.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.169
You should not be
friends with him.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.936
So, after reviewing
all the options,

04:24.998 --> 04:28.605
I found that the best location
for the dog park is Lot 48.

04:29.802 --> 04:30.872
The one behind
Ann's house.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.143
(LAUGHING)

04:33.706 --> 04:38.212
No, no, no, no, no. I've been trying
to put a park there for four years.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.858
See, the thing is, April,
that lot is mine.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.925
I've been doing
slow, painstaking work.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.428
So, I don't want to whip out
the legalese on you now,

04:45.485 --> 04:46.520
but I got dibs.

04:46.853 --> 04:47.923
What we are going
to do is

04:48.021 --> 04:50.058
we're going to take your enthusiasm,
we're going to bundle it up,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.602
and we're going to find a
new place for a dog park.

04:51.658 --> 04:52.659
Doesn't that sound fun?

04:52.725 --> 04:55.171
One, two, three. Cheese.
Good girl. (CLICKS)

04:55.962 --> 04:58.203
Morning, Andy.
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:59.899 --> 05:03.142
Okay. Something is different
about my computer.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.275
A-ha! It's gone.

05:07.907 --> 05:12.413
(GASPS)
A game is the foot.

05:12.612 --> 05:17.322
See, part of the Police Academy
entrance exam is investigating a crime.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.359
So, about a month ago, I
told everyone in the office,

05:19.419 --> 05:21.558
that at some point, they should
steal something from my desk

05:21.621 --> 05:23.032
so I can practice.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.791
Let's do this.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.969
Wait. Hey, did you guys
take my glasses, too?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.233
They got my sunglasses, too.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.644
I was in Miami
last weekend.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.407
I took my talents
to South Beach.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.980
How do you spend
your time in Miami?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.811
Maybe fencing
stolen computers?

05:38.938 --> 05:44.752
Yes. I took your government
computer from Indiana to Miami

05:44.944 --> 05:48.084
to sell it on the black
market for 150 bucks.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.425
Ha-ha! You don't know it, but
you just gave yourself away.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.623
(DOOR OPENS) I've got
to say, I'm impressed.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.325
Your mission statement
made sense.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.063
And you didn't use
one R. Kelly lyric.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.695
Yes. So, you want
to be my C.F.O.?

06:01.961 --> 06:04.805
Well, I already have a job,
but I'll help as a friend.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.878
As long as you take
what I say seriously.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.504
I don't want another Entertainment
720 disaster on our hands.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.275
Yeah. It was a disaster.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.343
Too bad we didn't see it coming. All right.
What's my first move?

06:16.743 --> 06:19.485
You know, I think any of the four
previous locations would work,

06:19.612 --> 06:20.920
but there's something
about this place.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.358
It's just a really good
energy here, you know?

06:23.449 --> 06:25.451
Lots of natural light.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.725
It's tiny and awful
and loud.

06:28.254 --> 06:31.599
And it's zoned 14-B, industrial
waste clean-up site.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.659
We should technically be wearing
hazmat suits right now.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.864
This seems like
the kind of place

06:34.927 --> 06:36.964
a ska band would go
to shoot heroin.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.873
Come on, guys. This is a
great place for a dog park.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.503
I mean, look. There's
already a dog here.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.206
Oh, my God. I had that exact
doll when I was a kid.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.643
This is traumatic for me.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.311
APRIL: Well, I'm sorry, but Lot
48 is the only one that works.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.511
And I'm definitely
bringing it up

06:51.577 --> 06:52.681
at the next city
council meeting.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.053
April, please,
I beg of you.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.286
I will do anything to
keep you from doing that.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.293
Okay. Saw off your pinky toe.
No.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.692
Shave your head.
No.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.425
Have sex with Jerry.
No.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.864
Well, I tried
to be reasonable.

07:03.289 --> 07:07.066
I've created a monster. And
now, I need to destroy her.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.539
What do I do, Joe?

07:09.662 --> 07:12.973
(MIMICS JOE) "Well, Leslie, look
into my eyes, take a deep breath,

07:13.032 --> 07:15.012
"and everything will be fine."

07:15.134 --> 07:19.241
Thanks, Joe.
God, he's good.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.681
Ron, thank you for
agreeing to see me.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.044
I didn't. You just walked
in here and started talking.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.215
I don't have time
for a history lesson.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.193
Look, I am trying to
remove parking meters.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.154
And there is a guy
in Public Works

07:33.219 --> 07:34.562
who's being
a real thorn about it.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.689
Which guy?

07:36.355 --> 07:37.356
Ricky Jordache.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.000
Never heard of him.
What's his deal?

07:39.058 --> 07:40.731
He's new.
He used to be a slacker,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.830
but now he's realizing
his full potential.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.273
But at what cost? He's
smart and he's beautiful.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.577
And I think of him in
many ways as a daughter.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.943
But that would be crazy 'cause he's a man.
His name is Ricky.

07:50.336 --> 07:51.508
Here's my question.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.207
How did you used
to slow me down

07:54.273 --> 07:55.946
when I was becoming
too "me-ish"?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.088
Sometimes, I'd just
give you busy work.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.385
I once had you
put together a brochure

08:00.446 --> 08:02.756
about different kinds
of Indiana topsoil.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.052
That soil brochure
was not busy work.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.757
I mean, people still refer to
"Mulch Ado About Nothing."

08:07.820 --> 08:11.324
And if you were particularly
amped up about a project,

08:11.390 --> 08:14.428
I'd take you to JJ's and
distract you with waffles.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.196
Those were
distraction waffles?

08:16.262 --> 08:17.536
I thought they were
friendship waffles.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.073
Breakfast food
can serve many purposes.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.973
But what if this person,
this Ricky,

08:22.034 --> 08:24.412
who is real,
doesn't like waffles?

08:24.637 --> 08:25.911
Or anything?

08:25.972 --> 08:28.509
Everybody has something
they're passionate about.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.779
Just figure out what it is,
express an interest in it,

08:31.911 --> 08:33.356
and divert his attention.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.957
(ROOSTER CROWING)
(GOAT BLEATING)

08:38.518 --> 08:39.929
(cow MOOING)

08:40.385 --> 08:44.425
Howdy, neighbors. Welcome to Human Farm.
Here's your animal feed.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.128
Please don't feed
the animals.

08:47.393 --> 08:52.399
Wow. This is really,
really cool.

08:52.598 --> 08:55.101
I like the statement
it's making.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.474
That, you know, we're
all in cages, in a way.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.848
Yeah, it's actually
about death and the city.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.453
Yeah. I see that now.
Hi, Orin.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.951
Ms. Wicks, if you've read our
proposal, you'll see that an alliance

09:10.016 --> 09:13.589
between Rent A Swag and Sweetums
could be mutually beneficial.

09:13.786 --> 09:17.825
Well, I must say, it's a much better
idea than the last one you had.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.962
That gourmet
French food thing?

09:21.527 --> 09:23.803
Oh! My escargot delivery service.
Snail Mail.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.206
So, you want to partner up
and make history?

09:26.265 --> 09:28.370
I mean, you've already
made history

09:28.434 --> 09:30.004
as the world's most
beautiful C.E.O.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.780
I'm really sorry, cutie.

09:31.938 --> 09:36.318
The company is laying low right
now due to a small mishap.

09:36.442 --> 09:40.481
Ah! Yes. A Sweetums molasses
storage vat exploded,

09:40.546 --> 09:43.254
resulting in a slow-moving
ecological disaster.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.257
Well, all press
is good press.

09:45.318 --> 09:50.290
No, this was bad press. A lot of
homes were very gradually flooded.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.898
People died.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.366
Actually, speaking of...

09:55.494 --> 09:58.964
We're starting up a non-profit
foundation to restore our name.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.533
Any interest in running it?

10:00.933 --> 10:04.813
Oh, I'm sorry. You want me
to run your non-profit wing?

10:04.971 --> 10:07.611
I know that Bobby Newport
is my stepson.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.950
But the work you did on
Leslie's campaign was amazing.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.585
Your name
is on our short list.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.091
Just to clarify.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.323
It's a no to me
on all fronts,

10:18.384 --> 10:19.590
and you're offering
Ben a job?

10:20.019 --> 10:21.054
Yeah.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.599
Cool. Cool.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.827
I've been looking at your
file all day, Jerry.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.462
If that even
is your real name.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.698
It's not.
My real name is Gary.

10:30.930 --> 10:34.503
Well, Gary, if that
even is your real name.

10:34.834 --> 10:38.611
Somebody stole my computer. Now,
if you're a criminal, look at me.

10:39.338 --> 10:43.980
You have to tell me, legally, or
else it's considered entrapment.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.954
I'm sorry, Andy.
It wasn't me.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.515
Oh, man. Really?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.424
No. Yeah.
Okay.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.556
Okay, so we know it's not Jerry,
unless he was lying to me.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.258
I can never tell when
people are lying to me.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.529
Hopefully, that doesn't
come up in my police work.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.437
I think we should do more
stuff like this, you know?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.498
I think Pawnee needs
an amazing arts program.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.703
Maybe you should just drop
everything and coordinate it.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.903
I'm not stupid.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.173
What is that
supposed to mean?

11:10.236 --> 11:12.546
It means that the only
reason you brought me here

11:12.605 --> 11:14.346
is to distract me
from the dog park.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.386
You hate this show.
I love this show.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.479
What's your favorite part?
The heavy-handedness.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.578
(SCOFFS)

11:19.645 --> 11:21.625
You know what? I have to go talk
to Councilman Jamm right now.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.319
Why are you talking
to Councilman Jamm?

11:23.382 --> 11:26.158
Because I told him about the
dog park idea and he loves it.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.754
He thinks it's a great idea.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.924
He's going to support
my motion

11:28.988 --> 11:30.558
at the city council
meeting tomorrow.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.670
And he gave me a really cool dental
mirror to check out my molars.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.296
Our dispute aside, you
should be careful with Jamm.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.739
He's a snake.
I'm telling you.

11:37.797 --> 11:41.574
Yeah, like I should trust you
out of all people right now.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.848
Moo. Moo.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.349
Quiet, weirdo.

11:46.505 --> 11:47.540
Aren't you supposed
to be a sheep?

11:47.807 --> 11:50.219
No. You are.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.021
Shut up.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.049
Tom would make a great
profile for your show.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.923
I mean, this is a guy
who's learned

11:56.982 --> 12:00.486
through an unbelievable series
of bonehead business moves.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.963
Not to mention,
in the last month alone,

12:03.089 --> 12:06.434
three people have confused me for
a shorter Indian Ryan Gosling.

12:06.692 --> 12:08.865
It's interesting, but I
think I need to wait

12:08.928 --> 12:11.033
until the business has been
around for a few months.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.701
Make sure it's viable.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.475
You're the guy who ran
the congressional campaign

12:15.534 --> 12:16.638
in Washington, right?

12:16.702 --> 12:19.148
Yeah. What, are you going
to offer him a job?

12:19.338 --> 12:22.217
Yes. We're launching
a new political chat show,

12:22.274 --> 12:23.651
and we need correspondents.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.383
Well, thank you, but I'm a
little shaky on live TV.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.993
Well, that's okay. People want authenticity.
Think about it?

12:31.050 --> 12:34.725
Didn't you hear him? He stinks on TV.
He sweats, he stutters.

12:34.854 --> 12:35.889
<i>It's like
The King's Speech.</i>

12:35.955 --> 12:37.491
But the first part,
before he's fixed.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.500
That was my favorite
part of the movie.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.170
What is happening?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.002
ANDY: Chris Traeger.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.668
Yep. Hi, Andy.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.274
I know you did it.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.433
Did what?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.774
(LAUGHING)

12:49.468 --> 12:51.846
Don't play stupid
and handsome with me.

12:52.138 --> 12:56.280
You stole my computer, so that I
could practice for my police exam.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.351
You're as guilty
as you are sexy.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.390
Andy, another computer
was reported stolen

13:01.480 --> 13:03.824
from the offices on the other
side of the courtyard.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.122
I don't think that this is
part of your police training.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.965
I think City Hall
was robbed.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.557
I can't tell
if you're lying to me.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.829
Really?
I think.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.132
Like, a real crime?
That's even better.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.971
Next order of business.
It's agenda item 280-B.

13:18.330 --> 13:22.403
A motion to construct a dog
park on Municipal Lot 48.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.045
Ms. Ludgate,
you have the floor.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.673
APRIL: Thank you,
Councilman Jamm.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.413
Your help and general non-awfulness
is much appreciated.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.585
Leslie.
Members of the council,

13:33.813 --> 13:37.056
I believe that Municipal Lot
48 should be a dog park.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.387
Boo. Boo.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.159
Well, it sounds like there is
considerable opposition to this.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.325
So, I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate.
You should go now.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.402
Really? I just heard
one hag booing.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.165
Ladies, please.
Let's keep this civil.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.104
(CLEARS THROAT)
Councilmen, Pawneeans,

13:51.430 --> 13:53.774
satisfied customers
of Jamm Orthodontics,

13:54.066 --> 13:58.742
as we discuss what type of park to
put on Lot 48, I had a thought.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.548
How about no park? Who here
thinks parks are stupid?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.221
Let the record show that
everyone is raising their hands.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.217
I happen to know
for a fact that

14:08.280 --> 14:10.624
Pawnee's favorite
fast-food restaurant,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.492
Paunch Burger,
needs a new location.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.725
Now, seeing as how the future
of Lot 48 is open for debate,

14:15.855 --> 14:19.769
I move we sell it to Paunch
Burger for a nice profit.

14:20.292 --> 14:24.138
You don't even have to be
Asian to do math that simple.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.708
You told me
you wanted a dog park.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.707
Uh... Psych.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.609
That's not fair.
You lied to me.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.514
You just got Jammed.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.608
I hate when he says that.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.344
I told you that
Jamm was a snake.

14:37.509 --> 14:38.749
Well, it takes a snake
to know a snake.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.188
LESLIE:
So, now, I'm a snake.

14:40.246 --> 14:43.955
Yes. You deceived me for two
straight days and you eat mice.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.084
I don't eat mice.
Yes, you do.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.527
LESLIE: No. You're a mouse eater.
Mouse eater.

14:46.585 --> 14:47.723
RON: Enough.
Mouse eater.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.130
You are friends
and co-workers.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.067
In this office, we treat
each other with respect.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.294
Hey, April, how's that
dog park coming?

14:55.427 --> 14:56.462
Get out, Jerry.

14:56.528 --> 14:57.802
This is private!
Get out right now.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.570
LESLIE: Hey!
Sorry, guys.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.405
We are not leaving here until
you two figure this out.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.672
Ron, guard the door.
RON: Yes, sir.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.276
No one leaves the octagon.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.878
I dated an ultimate fighter.
It's, like, a thing he said.

15:13.512 --> 15:14.547
What's the play here,
officer?

15:14.613 --> 15:17.219
Are we going to set up a
perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.860
Ooh, I know. We could put out a
dummy computer for them to steal,

15:19.985 --> 15:22.329
fill it with explosives first.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

15:22.388 --> 15:23.799
Boom. Take them all out.

15:24.456 --> 15:25.628
Yeah, we're not doing
any of that.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.237
Andy, I love
your enthusiasm.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.931
But we don't really
have the kind of money

15:28.994 --> 15:30.564
to launch a massive
investigation.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.640
You're just going to fill out
this stupid report and that's it?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.346
As a future cop, you have to
understand, I cannot let this guy go.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.643
Look, man. This is what
most police work is.

15:41.106 --> 15:45.020
Just writing stuff down.
It's not superhero time.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.818
If that sounds boring, maybe you
ought to do something else.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.686
Maybe we should
find the person

15:52.751 --> 15:54.662
who stole his
positive attitude.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.062
(DOOR OPENS)

15:57.122 --> 15:58.726
Hey, man.
Hey, man.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.064
Get any more job offers
since I last saw you?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.434
Yeah, it was just a management
position at Urban Outfitters.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.904
I turned it down.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.036
I don't know, man.
Maybe I can't hack this.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.135
Maybe I should
take a cue from you

16:09.201 --> 16:11.010
and stick with
my boring dayjob.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.614
My accounting job
isn't boring.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.276
If it was remotely
interesting,

16:15.341 --> 16:17.014
there would be
a show on A&E about it.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.578
They have a show about
storage unit auctions.

16:19.244 --> 16:23.158
Fair point. Look. If you're
passionate about this, keep at it.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.888
Things will turn around.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.051
Also, can you tell me

16:26.118 --> 16:28.462
what time that show
about storage units is on?

16:29.221 --> 16:30.359
9:30.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.527
(sums)

16:32.591 --> 16:34.969
All right. I'm going to
have to force this. Leslie.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.597
Maybe you want to admit that you
haven't been the greatest role model.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.199
I don't care.
Orin's my role model.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.971
April,
maybe you want to admit

16:41.033 --> 16:43.070
that you've been a little
selfish and inconsiderate.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.540
Look. All I ever wanted

16:45.637 --> 16:48.709
was for you to show the enthusiasm
you showed for your dog park.

16:48.774 --> 16:52.415
And when you did, I blew it.
And I'm sorry.

16:52.611 --> 16:56.081
Fine. I'm sorry that I
outsmarted you at every turn.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.786
April.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.758
And I know I have
a lot to learn from you,

17:00.185 --> 17:03.189
and I'm sorry that I
disrespected your stupid dream.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.469
A lot of love
in this room.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.901
I'm very, very sorry.
Me, too.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.998
I love you very much.
I love you, too.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.769
I don't want to do
this in front of her.

17:12.830 --> 17:13.832
Okay.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.537
Okay, Ann,
since you're such a genius,

17:15.601 --> 17:16.772
what do we do now?

17:16.835 --> 17:17.973
Neither of you
want Jamm to win.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.142
Nor do I. Because I
hate Paunch Burger.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.582
But if there is one
in my backyard,

17:21.640 --> 17:22.675
I will eat there,
like, every night.

17:22.741 --> 17:23.742
And that is no good.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.847
So, I say we stop playing
dirty with each other,

17:26.912 --> 17:28.789
and we start playing
dirty with Jamm.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.554
Yes. We'll have
triple-sex with him.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.755
No. I have an idea.
It's very uncool,

17:32.885 --> 17:34.364
but it's not illegal,
technically.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.661
But it is a dick move.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.723
I love it.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.568
Hey, Captain,
status update.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.969
My new suspect, the dude
who runs Carpet Emporium.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.769
The way I figure is, criminals
love to wrap things up in rugs.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.312
Plus, he yelled at me when I
tried to unroll them all. So...

17:50.402 --> 17:53.576
Andy, while I appreciate your
dedication to finding this criminal,

17:53.639 --> 17:56.415
I think you might want to take into
account what the policeman said.

17:56.475 --> 18:00.821
I mean, gosh. If I can't
even investigate bad guys,

18:01.480 --> 18:03.482
why become a cop at all?

18:03.982 --> 18:05.017
What are you doing?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.392
When I get bummed out
I take my shirt off,

18:06.452 --> 18:08.432
because the bad feelings
make me feel sweaty.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.061
(sums)

18:10.689 --> 18:13.260
You know what? Maybe I
should bail on being a cop.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.299
City Hall needs a new
part-time security guard

18:17.362 --> 18:18.602
for the weekends.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.507
You want to do that?
Look at it as a way

18:20.566 --> 18:23.137
to feel out whether you want
to be a police officer.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.140
But keep in mind,
if you take this job,

18:25.204 --> 18:27.150
you must keep your
clothes on at all times.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.411
Even if you get sad.
No deal.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.146
Okay, I'll do it.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.054
That a boy. I'll do it.
I promise.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.560
And I get a gun, and I can
point it at people's faces.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.784
Incorrect.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.893
(DOGS BARKING)
(CHILDREN SHOUTING)

18:42.221 --> 18:44.223
JAMM: Hey.
What the hell is going on?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.461
Oh, hello, Councilman.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.898
The dogs are here

18:46.959 --> 18:48.905
because there's no dog park
in your neighborhood.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.272
And the kids are here because
there's no human park in your area.

18:52.331 --> 18:53.776
They all needed
a place to play.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.368
My front lawn?
That's right.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.809
And they're going
to keep using it

18:56.869 --> 18:58.542
until there's an actual
park nearby.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.274
Hey, lady, get that
thing off my gnome.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.115
He is dry-humping
my garden gnome.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.245
Stupid beast.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.310
Councilman Jamm,

19:05.444 --> 19:08.448
we just need a little bit
more time to design our park.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.627
And if you plow through
and ignore us,

19:10.682 --> 19:11.820
this is going
to be your life.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.523
I'll call the police.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.395
Yeah, sic the police on a
bunch of kids and puppies.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.332
That's a great photo op.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.200
Fine.
Gentleman's agreement.

19:21.627 --> 19:24.403
In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote.
Winner take all.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.904
Deal.
Great.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.307
Now, call off
the actual dogs.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.936
I want these kids
off my lawn.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.413
I want that hula hoop
off my Vette. Right now.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.379
Hey, Jamm.

19:33.438 --> 19:38.683
You just got Knoped and
Ludgated and Perkinsed.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.858
Ha-ha. Nice try. Didn't work.
You just got Jammed.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.656
(DOOR SLAMS)

19:44.716 --> 19:46.457
Okay.
So, let's get to work.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.189
Wait, wait, wait. Do you never just
take a second to enjoy things?

19:50.455 --> 19:51.593
I just said,
"Let's get to work."

19:51.657 --> 19:53.295
How else do people
enjoy things?

19:55.060 --> 19:58.974
I know you changed your mind the
last time we offered you a job.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.602
But we are just thrilled
that you changed it again.

20:01.667 --> 20:02.702
Thank you. Me, too.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.577
This is our best office.
Ah!

20:04.670 --> 20:06.616
As you can see
through the window,

20:06.672 --> 20:09.414
you have a great view of the
billing department. (CHUCKLES)

20:09.474 --> 20:10.612
Hey, Sharon!

20:10.676 --> 20:11.677
(SHUSHING)

20:12.311 --> 20:13.881
Sorry. She's fun.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.055
So, please, if there
is anything we can do

20:17.115 --> 20:20.562
to make you happier in your
new job, just let me know.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.099
No, this is great,
Barney. Thank you.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.167
But I have to quit.

20:27.826 --> 20:28.930
Again.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.473
What?

20:30.529 --> 20:32.406
Oh! Is this
a classic Ben joke?

20:32.464 --> 20:36.412
No. I'm really sorry, but I
just don't want to do this.

20:36.602 --> 20:40.140
I need to move my life
in another direction.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.685
This is disappointing.
Again.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.681
Maybe someday we'll figure
out the magic formula

20:46.745 --> 20:48.122
that gets you to work here.

20:48.180 --> 20:52.890
Well, formulas are my
formula for moolah. So...

20:54.453 --> 20:58.265
Ted, get in here.
Ben is quitting again,

20:58.323 --> 21:00.303
but you've got to hear
what he said.

21:00.492 --> 21:03.666
<i>BEN: Leslie's been saying for weeks
I should do something I love,</i>

21:03.729 --> 21:05.299
<i>and she's right.</i>

21:05.364 --> 21:08.208
<i>I'll help Tom, or maybe
try to do that TV thing,</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:10.645
<i>or maybe work for
the Sweetums foundation.</i>

21:10.736 --> 21:13.717
I don't know. Life is short. Why
be an accountant? You know?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.019
I mean, other than the
stability and the health plan

21:17.142 --> 21:18.917
and the above average pay.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.691
Oh, God, this better work out.
