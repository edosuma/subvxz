WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:03.694
It's about time, Mr. Lollygag.

00:03.757 --> 00:05.334
I sent you to the store hours ago.

00:05.382 --> 00:07.883
Sorry, Mom. I tried to drive
fast but there were squirrels.

00:07.983 --> 00:10.016
<i>My mom and Frank
had this weird co-dependency</i>

00:10.102 --> 00:12.135
<i>where his happiness
was tied to her happiness,</i>

00:12.237 --> 00:13.854
<i>but so was her happiness.</i>

00:13.939 --> 00:16.523
- Hell's bells, <i>real</i> Cool Whip?
- It was on your list.

00:16.608 --> 00:18.775
- Oh...
- You let him buy real Cool Whip?

00:18.861 --> 00:20.249
Did I get a raise I don't know about?

00:20.327 --> 00:22.863
I wrote Cool Whip with a "K,"
the cheap store brand.

00:22.948 --> 00:24.364
Never buy anything spelled correctly.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.483
At Ralph's you pay extra for grammar.

00:26.585 --> 00:28.535
Been a long day.
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.620
- It won't happen again, Mom.
- I need to be able to count on you

00:30.706 --> 00:32.289
while your dad's doing
all this overtime.

00:34.259 --> 00:37.561
Greetings and salutations, madam!

00:37.624 --> 00:39.662
<i>I had been cast
in a production of "Show Boat,"</i>

00:39.765 --> 00:41.131
<i>playing a suave riverboat gambler.</i>

00:41.216 --> 00:42.999
<i>Unfortunately, the only
person from the South</i>

00:43.102 --> 00:45.168
<i>I was familiar with was Foghorn Leghorn.</i>

00:45.270 --> 00:48.388
I say, I say, what a charming evening,

00:48.474 --> 00:51.308
the scent of juniper filling the air.

00:51.369 --> 00:52.572
- Oh.
- It's not juniper,

00:52.596 --> 00:53.945
it's Mom's boiled cabbage.

00:53.946 --> 00:55.645
And you missed out!

00:55.731 --> 00:57.481
Enjoy your peanut butter
sandwich for supper.

00:57.566 --> 00:59.900
Oh, I think we can do better
than that for our star.

00:59.985 --> 01:03.069
- Star.
- I am the star!

01:03.155 --> 01:04.703
I totally aced my audition.

01:04.822 --> 01:07.157
How many male roles in this show?

01:07.242 --> 01:08.375
Seventeen.

01:09.962 --> 01:12.129
Maybe we should've put up more fliers.

01:16.752 --> 01:19.369
I'm making a Hungry-Man dinner for
your dad. I'll throw one in for you.

01:19.471 --> 01:22.539
He gets a Hungry-Man for showing up late?
Why is Timmy so special?

01:22.641 --> 01:24.758
Oh, he's only special
compared to the rest of you.

01:24.843 --> 01:27.894
Oh, you hear that?
It's not you, it's us!

01:28.013 --> 01:29.379
How'd rehearsal go?

01:29.481 --> 01:31.148
Did you bring up my suggestion
of adding a genie?

01:31.233 --> 01:33.383
I doubt they'd have a genie
on a Mississippi riverboat.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.152
All I know is it works on that show.

01:35.237 --> 01:37.154
This production has much
bigger problems, Mom.

01:37.239 --> 01:38.822
I'm doing the best work of my career,

01:38.907 --> 01:40.524
but these sets are amateur hour.

01:40.609 --> 01:42.776
It's called "Show Boat,"
and so far there's <i> no</i> boat.

01:42.861 --> 01:44.828
Wendi says they can't spend
any money on sets.

01:44.913 --> 01:47.230
The whole point is raising funds
for soccer equipment.

01:47.332 --> 01:49.899
The whole point is reaching
across those footlights

01:50.002 --> 01:51.901
to bring a <i> little</i> magic
into people's lives.

01:52.004 --> 01:54.571
And what's more magical than a genie?

01:54.673 --> 01:57.574
I'll shut up now.

01:57.676 --> 01:59.742
I couldn't help overhear
that your little show

01:59.845 --> 02:02.629
might be in need of some
nautical-themed items.

02:02.714 --> 02:05.015
I am a man with influential
friends and associates.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.683
Uh-huh, you saw "The Godfather" again.

02:06.768 --> 02:08.717
Seriously, how do you keep
getting into that movie?

02:08.771 --> 02:09.988
I am a man with influential

02:10.044 --> 02:11.556
friends and associates.

02:11.557 --> 02:14.090
I might be able to procure
some boat stuff for your set.

02:14.193 --> 02:15.308
What's that gonna cost me?

02:15.394 --> 02:17.594
You insult me with offers of money.

02:17.696 --> 02:18.928
But someday...

02:19.031 --> 02:20.480
and this day may never come...

02:20.566 --> 02:22.766
I will call upon you
to do a service for me.

02:22.868 --> 02:23.967
You're saying it may never come?

02:24.036 --> 02:26.019
Oh... it'll come.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.086
So, what have I been missing
around here?

02:28.140 --> 02:29.742
Anything interesting with the kids?

02:29.820 --> 02:30.874
You skip a few nights at home,

02:30.943 --> 02:32.309
you think they suddenly get interesting?

02:32.377 --> 02:33.894
<i>That's</i> kind of interesting.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.350
Oh, my God.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.851
Joey got that for my show!

02:41.920 --> 02:43.954
How does he get his mitts
on crazy stuff like that?

02:43.990 --> 02:45.190
Don't ask too many questions.

02:45.246 --> 02:46.891
Otherwise, I might have
to return my Ginsu knives.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.808
I just hope there's not some
ocean liner out there,

02:48.894 --> 02:50.794
drifting around in circles.

02:50.862 --> 02:53.597
Frank, you'll need to drive
Timmy to his rehearsal.

02:53.699 --> 02:55.765
He's not gonna be able to carry
that wheel on his bike.

02:56.089 --> 02:58.039
You've got the whole house
jumping through hoops

02:58.111 --> 02:59.176
just because you're in a show.

02:59.238 --> 03:00.770
- It's not fair.
- If it bugs you,

03:00.839 --> 03:02.639
do something great
that people like, like I do.

03:02.708 --> 03:05.709
I'm great at important things
like algebra and penmanship...

03:05.794 --> 03:07.160
not lame stuff like musicals.

03:07.279 --> 03:09.145
"Show Boat," lame?

03:09.197 --> 03:12.382
Tell that to legendary
theater impresario...

03:12.434 --> 03:14.417
Florenz Ziegfeld.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.819
<i>Looking back, it's shocking</i>

03:15.887 --> 03:17.720
<i>that my brothers didn't punch me more.</i>

03:17.773 --> 03:19.606
Hey!

03:19.691 --> 03:21.174
Look what we brought!

03:21.260 --> 03:23.927
A genuine captain's wheel? Far out!

03:24.029 --> 03:25.528
Yeah, my brother got it for us
for the <i> Cotton Blossom.</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:28.531
Thanks so much, Frank!

03:28.583 --> 03:29.854
Oh. Oh, no, no, I meant my...

03:29.916 --> 03:32.202
I like to support the theater.

03:32.271 --> 03:34.604
Aren't you late for your dumb nonsense?

03:34.706 --> 03:36.039
Yeah.

03:36.141 --> 03:38.341
Are you one of the actors, too, then?

03:38.410 --> 03:40.243
No, I'm from the soccer team.

03:40.279 --> 03:41.878
We're hoping to buy
shin guards this year

03:41.930 --> 03:43.746
so I can finally stop bleeding
through my knee socks.

03:43.799 --> 03:45.848
We tried to get her
to be in the show because...

03:45.901 --> 03:48.285
Uh-huh, because why?

03:48.337 --> 03:52.188
You know, because it's set
in the South, and...

03:52.291 --> 03:54.109
you have such a beautiful singing voice.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.351
I don't.

03:55.377 --> 03:57.260
But I am the only
black person in school.

03:59.481 --> 04:01.164
We should get this wheel backstage.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.434
Ladies, I can handle it.
I placed in the 75th percentile

04:04.536 --> 04:07.103
for the President's
Physical Fitness Test.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.910
Hey pal, look what Gino brought me.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.445
A whole case.

04:15.497 --> 04:17.314
- Check this out.
- How'd you come across <i> that?</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:20.083
Well, let's just say
it fell off the back of a truck.

04:20.152 --> 04:22.318
- Is that what happened?
- Pretty much.

04:22.371 --> 04:23.634
Truck hit a speed bump,
it fell off the back.

04:23.658 --> 04:24.845
This pleases me.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.790
You two have shown me great respect.

04:26.858 --> 04:28.675
Oh, hey, can I try out your ring?

04:30.000 --> 04:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:37.019 --> 04:39.202
I know what you're thinking, but no,

04:39.271 --> 04:41.371
this wasn't done
by professional carpenters.

04:41.423 --> 04:45.342
It's terrible, but your wheel
will definitely help.

04:49.448 --> 04:51.681
For the record, I wanted to do
a bake sale.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.017
Hold the work backstage!

04:54.086 --> 04:57.787
The artists are attempting
to engage the muse.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.622
From the fourth bar.

04:59.691 --> 05:03.360
Gaylord and Magnolia,
feeling the first tender shoots

05:03.412 --> 05:05.328
of love's flowering.

05:05.414 --> 05:10.100
♪ Might as well make believe ♪

05:10.168 --> 05:17.574
♪ I love you ♪

05:17.659 --> 05:22.846
♪ For to tell the truth ♪

05:22.948 --> 05:30.937
♪ I do ♪

05:31.022 --> 05:32.922
Lovely, children.

05:33.024 --> 05:35.358
Nice working with you, kiddo.
You've got some chops.

05:35.427 --> 05:37.093
We might want to speak to costumes

05:37.145 --> 05:38.678
about getting you some lifts.

05:40.682 --> 05:42.331
There goes our money
for the soccer team.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.966
I should've gone to public school.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.769
They have Title IX, pizza Fridays,

05:45.871 --> 05:47.703
and other black people.

05:47.756 --> 05:49.372
We'll never be ready by show night.

05:49.424 --> 05:51.841
What if we went at this differently?

05:51.910 --> 05:54.527
- Like a bake sale?
- Forget the three-dimensional boat,

05:54.613 --> 05:56.379
we could do something
lightweight in two dimensions

05:56.431 --> 05:59.149
- and suspend it from a traverse rod.
- That sounds smart.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.285
I placed in the 76th percentile
in Engineering and Physics.

06:02.370 --> 06:05.221
I would go with 2/10 scale
with a forced perspective.

06:05.273 --> 06:07.524
We'll build the ship...

06:07.559 --> 06:12.595
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

06:12.681 --> 06:14.264
10 Frank's feet long.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.699
That sounds great, but we don't
have time to start over.

06:16.802 --> 06:18.785
We do if I help,
and we keep it very simple.

06:18.904 --> 06:21.137
We need a steam whistle,
smoke machine, lots of lights,

06:21.239 --> 06:22.439
and a rotating paddle wheel.

06:22.524 --> 06:24.274
Your set will look like a million bucks.

06:24.376 --> 06:25.575
We have ten.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.310
Eight. I bought gum for the crew.

06:29.631 --> 06:31.614
Where on Earth are you
coming from, Frank?

06:31.683 --> 06:33.149
I swear I heard you
cleaning the gutters,

06:33.235 --> 06:34.751
stomping around up there.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.753
That possum must be putting on weight.

06:36.822 --> 06:39.088
Sorry, Mom, I stuck around
to help work on Timmy's sets.

06:39.157 --> 06:40.523
Every day you put the gutters off,

06:40.609 --> 06:42.225
that possum becomes
a more formidable foe.

06:42.310 --> 06:44.160
Why can't somebody else
do the gutters, like Lawrence?

06:44.262 --> 06:45.662
'Cause I told <i> you</i> to do it.

06:45.714 --> 06:47.297
Yeah. Plus, I have that inner-ear thing.

06:47.382 --> 06:49.799
Whenever I go up on a ladder,
my inner ear hears the words,

06:49.901 --> 06:51.534
"This seems like a Frank job."

06:51.636 --> 06:54.037
Mom, guess what?
I'm playing two roles now.

06:54.139 --> 06:55.905
They asked me to also play
Stevedore Joe,

06:55.974 --> 06:57.540
so I get to sing "Old Man River"!

06:57.642 --> 06:58.975
Isn't Joe an Afro-American?

06:59.077 --> 07:01.244
It'll be my greatest acting challenge.

07:01.279 --> 07:04.030
But no black-face. That's
considered in poor taste now.

07:04.115 --> 07:06.182
- Very good, Mom.
- Hmm. Heard that

07:06.284 --> 07:08.234
- from an Oriental.
- Eh, there it is.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.854
So, I'm thinking I want to keep
helping the girls with the set.

07:10.906 --> 07:13.907
- They really like my ideas.
- Ideas.

07:13.992 --> 07:16.075
No, I have much too much work
for you to do around here.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.760
Besides, I only have room in this family

07:17.812 --> 07:19.295
for one insufferable show-off.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.314
Forward roll!

07:21.399 --> 07:23.065
Here we go.

07:23.118 --> 07:25.285
- Oh!
- Wow.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.903
- Cleary residence.
<i>- Hey, Frank.</i>

07:27.005 --> 07:28.605
- Oh, hi, Wendi.
<i>- Hey, thanks again</i>

07:28.707 --> 07:29.873
for all your help today.

07:29.975 --> 07:32.709
Yeah, about that. I'm not sure...

07:32.811 --> 07:34.683
Oh, we're asking too much, aren't we?

07:34.707 --> 07:35.619
N...

07:35.644 --> 07:37.931
<i>I-I understand.
It's just watching you today,</i>

07:38.016 --> 07:39.816
<i>all lit up with inspiration,</i>

07:39.901 --> 07:41.484
this show started to get fun again.

07:41.570 --> 07:43.353
Well, it's just I'm not sure...

07:43.438 --> 07:46.689
Hey, hey.

07:46.775 --> 07:48.057
- Whup!
- Nice!

07:48.159 --> 07:49.609
...how I'll be able to sleep tonight,

07:49.694 --> 07:51.027
dreaming about
putting that boat together.

07:51.112 --> 07:54.230
- See you tomorrow, Wendi.
- Is that my girlfriend?

07:54.332 --> 07:56.499
Sorry you had to talk to Frank.

07:56.585 --> 08:00.012
Now the receiver
smells like Frank breath.

08:03.614 --> 08:06.991
♪ You an' me, we sweat an' strain ♪

08:07.054 --> 08:10.561
<i>To get away with defying Mom,
Frank had to work double-duty,</i>

08:10.600 --> 08:13.034
<i>still executing all her heinous chores</i>

08:13.143 --> 08:16.127
<i>and then secretly slipping away
to build sets with Wendi.</i>

08:16.213 --> 08:21.349
♪ An' you land in jaaaaiiiil... ♪

08:32.412 --> 08:34.511
What's up? Besides us.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.164
- Ha!
- No horseplay! I'm on a ladder.

08:37.234 --> 08:38.566
Where did you get the scissor lift?

08:38.669 --> 08:40.168
If I tell you, everyone gets one,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.169
then they're not cool anymore.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.741
That looks like pretty grim work.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.946
It's not bad, except for
the baby bird skeletons,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.977
but I get the satisfaction
of helping Mom.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.680
More satisfaction than helping
those girls from the play

08:50.776 --> 08:53.994
who are your own age
and not related to you?

08:54.080 --> 08:56.881
Entertainment folk with their
free and easy ways...

08:56.983 --> 08:58.549
Nobody's "free and easy."

08:58.651 --> 09:00.885
They're nice girls who
just want to play soccer.

09:00.953 --> 09:03.387
How about I take over here for you

09:03.456 --> 09:05.906
so you can go hang out
with your show folk?

09:05.992 --> 09:08.626
Then one day, you can do a favor for me.

09:11.931 --> 09:13.714
Okay.

09:13.799 --> 09:16.283
But if isn't done to perfection,
Mom'll know it wasn't me.

09:16.402 --> 09:18.269
Relax, I'll do it exactly like someone

09:18.294 --> 09:20.069
who is weirdly obsessed with
the approval of his mother.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.327
You better.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.522
Where'd that thing come from?

09:38.558 --> 09:40.224
I know a guy who knows a guy.

09:40.326 --> 09:41.892
In court they're called accomplices.

09:41.994 --> 09:44.428
Get down from there.
You and I are going for seafood.

09:48.668 --> 09:50.267
Hey, you know that favor you owe me?

09:50.369 --> 09:51.969
I need it right now, and fast.

09:52.021 --> 09:54.488
You think something like this
is a harmless prank,

09:54.607 --> 09:57.258
but folks have gone to jail for less.

09:57.343 --> 10:00.227
- I don't want to go to jail.
- No, you don't.

10:00.313 --> 10:03.230
There are much better ways
to see Johnny Cash for free.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.783
But maybe if you and I go in the
restaurant and you apologize,

10:05.851 --> 10:06.784
we can smooth this over.

10:06.886 --> 10:09.119
Okay.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.888
But what am I apologizing for?

10:10.990 --> 10:12.456
Seriously?

10:12.525 --> 10:14.124
You're gonna sit there and deny
that you stole that?

10:15.561 --> 10:17.761
Stole what?

10:21.017 --> 10:23.367
That wasn't there before.

10:27.573 --> 10:29.773
Let's go. Come on.

10:29.842 --> 10:32.472
Just point it at the backdrop and...

10:34.146 --> 10:37.481
Wow! So pretty, Frank.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.516
You're an artist.

10:39.619 --> 10:41.418
Is that somebody surfing
on the Mississippi River?

10:41.520 --> 10:43.354
Oh, I shot this at Zuma Beach.

10:43.422 --> 10:44.805
We can splice that out.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.290
You should be really proud.

10:46.392 --> 10:48.575
I mean, you built a really great set.

10:48.661 --> 10:50.861
And more importantly,
got Melissa to stop yapping

10:50.963 --> 10:52.295
about her bake sale.

10:52.348 --> 10:53.597
I'm selling cupcakes in the lobby.

10:53.649 --> 10:55.065
I don't care what anybody says.

10:55.117 --> 10:57.167

- <i>There I was, singing my guts out,</i>

11:27.923 --> 11:30.008
<i>and all anyone was looking at
was Frank's stupid boat.</i>

11:30.039 --> 11:31.283
Frank!

11:31.307 --> 11:32.954
<i>My pride kept me
from caring what they thought...</i>

11:32.955 --> 11:36.073
- <i>or it would have if I had any.</i>
- Forward roll!

11:47.586 --> 11:50.721
Look, all I'm asking is you tone
down the effects tomorrow night

11:50.773 --> 11:52.423
so the audience notices I'm there.

11:52.491 --> 11:54.692
Actors, they always think
they're the ones

11:54.760 --> 11:57.594
people come to see,
but the star tonight was my set.

11:57.663 --> 12:00.114
And me! I play the boat!

12:00.199 --> 12:02.866
Okay, the stage crew
liked it, sure, but tomorrow

12:02.968 --> 12:05.135
is a paying audience of
soccer team boosters...

12:05.204 --> 12:07.938
a more sophisticated, European crowd.

12:08.007 --> 12:09.473
I'm not changing a thing.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.708
It's called "Show Boat," not Show Timmy.

12:11.811 --> 12:13.644
<i>Frank had gotten his first
taste of that fleeting,</i>

12:13.696 --> 12:15.946
<i>shallow showbiz glory
that feels so much better</i>

12:15.981 --> 12:17.147
<i>than actual love,</i>

12:17.199 --> 12:18.866
<i>but it was supposed to mine.</i>

12:18.951 --> 12:21.785
<i>And in taking it,
he had made a powerful enemy.</i>

12:21.887 --> 12:24.655
Hey, Dad, why don't you
get out that projector

12:24.757 --> 12:26.690
and show us those home movies
you took at the air show?

12:27.827 --> 12:29.560
Outstanding idea.

12:29.662 --> 12:31.645
- Mm-hmm.
- Buckle up, kids.

12:31.731 --> 12:34.564
Tonight we are soaring
with the Blue Angels!

12:36.302 --> 12:37.551
His air show movies?

12:37.670 --> 12:39.369
Really? Why would you do that to us?

12:39.438 --> 12:41.655
I'll have to find my glasses
with the fake open eyes.

12:41.741 --> 12:44.208
We all agreed we'd only let him
show those on Father's Day

12:44.276 --> 12:45.943
and <i> only</i> if we forgot to get him a card.

12:45.978 --> 12:47.194
And ever since we made that rule,

12:47.279 --> 12:49.046
we have never forgotten the card.

12:49.115 --> 12:51.148
Oh, come on. Those movies aren't so bad,

12:51.250 --> 12:52.883
and it makes your dad happy
when we watch 'em together.

12:52.968 --> 12:54.384
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Peg!

12:54.470 --> 12:57.054
My Bell and Howell projector is gone!

12:57.123 --> 12:59.423
Well, things have a way of
disappearing around this house.

12:59.508 --> 13:02.643
I can't keep a bra catalogue!

13:02.728 --> 13:03.977
Your projector is missing?

13:04.063 --> 13:05.695
- I don't know.
- That's strange.

13:05.748 --> 13:07.464
I might know who had something
to do with this.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.500
Joey!

13:09.602 --> 13:11.151
You know anything about
my missing projector?

13:11.270 --> 13:13.570
No, Pop, but I can ask
Mousey and Ray-Ray

13:13.672 --> 13:15.572
- to check the word on the street.
- Or maybe I can call the police

13:15.674 --> 13:17.107
and have them search the premises,

13:17.209 --> 13:18.776
including a certain, uh, tree house.

13:18.861 --> 13:21.612
You don't have to call the police.

13:21.697 --> 13:23.247
- I took your projector.
- You took it?

13:23.349 --> 13:25.249
I'm using it for special effects
in "Show Boat."

13:25.351 --> 13:27.384
Oh, maybe we should've
taken you to the doctor

13:27.436 --> 13:29.219
when you failed that hearing
test at school and they said

13:29.271 --> 13:31.638
it might be something serious,
because I specifically told you

13:31.724 --> 13:34.424
- <i>not</i> to work on "Show Boat."
- I know, but I-I...

13:34.510 --> 13:37.638
I like it. I'm good at it,
and it makes me happy.

13:37.662 --> 13:38.722
Is that the groovy, new trend now?

13:38.747 --> 13:41.365
Everyone doing things that
they're good at and being happy?

13:41.467 --> 13:43.100
Plus the people there
show me appreciation,

13:43.185 --> 13:44.501
which never happens around here.

13:44.553 --> 13:45.903
Hey, pal, your appreciation is

13:45.971 --> 13:47.538
that we haven't sold you to the Gypsies.

13:47.623 --> 13:49.540
Yeah, I'm starting to wonder
what's really going on...

13:49.642 --> 13:51.141
if this sudden interest in theater

13:51.243 --> 13:52.642
is really an interest in those girls?

13:52.745 --> 13:53.944
- What?!
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.414 --> 13:57.314
No! Wh-What's going on here

13:57.416 --> 13:59.216
is you can't stand me doing
something away from you

13:59.285 --> 14:00.684
that isn't under your thumb!

14:00.769 --> 14:03.387
I'm just trying to protect you
from making a fool of yourself.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.188
The only thing you're protecting me from

14:05.241 --> 14:06.790
is having my own life

14:06.876 --> 14:08.342
because it means maybe someday

14:08.460 --> 14:10.660
I won't be at your beck and call!

14:10.763 --> 14:13.330
You're so afraid to go out
in the world and do things,

14:13.432 --> 14:15.966
you just want the rest of us to be
as afraid of the world as you are.

14:16.051 --> 14:18.635
- Hey, knock it off!
- Well, I'm <i> not</i> afraid!

14:18.721 --> 14:20.470
And I'm not afraid of you.

14:24.276 --> 14:26.026
I'm still scared of you, Mom.

14:26.145 --> 14:28.127
Thank you, William.

14:28.221 --> 14:29.986
You always know just what to say.

14:31.276 --> 14:33.025
<i>Once the idea
of watching air show movies</i>

14:33.104 --> 14:34.830
<i>got into his head,
my dad couldn't sleep.</i>

14:34.877 --> 14:37.361
<i>And he wasn't about to let the
lack of a projector stop him.</i>

14:37.432 --> 14:40.466
Ooh, delta formation.

14:40.552 --> 14:42.220
Such precision.

14:42.283 --> 14:44.653
Whoa, they're flying backwards.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.255
There you go.

14:55.491 --> 14:58.526
Ahoy, buttheads. King crabs,
straight from Seafood Fart.

14:58.551 --> 15:00.410
Seriously bummed to see that "O" back.

15:00.434 --> 15:02.159
Pull up the ladder in case of visitors.

15:02.184 --> 15:03.653
My brother Pat climbs in his sleep.

15:03.677 --> 15:05.640
One of the crabs got away from me
when I was locking up my bike.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.582
They trick you by running sideways.

15:07.667 --> 15:09.714
Wow. These are almost as nice

15:09.800 --> 15:11.464
as the crabs I got from your sister.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.617
- I don't have a sister.
- You have any girl cousins?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.109
- Yeah.
- Then it works.

15:15.194 --> 15:16.921
Where were we? Oh, yeah,

15:17.006 --> 15:18.911
I believe this is mine.

15:18.965 --> 15:21.159
Again? Seriously?

15:21.244 --> 15:23.387
Oh, you'll have a chance to win it back.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.429
- Five card stud.
- Look what I found in my tree...

15:26.453 --> 15:28.780
some delinquent Keebler Elves.

15:28.835 --> 15:31.687
Dad, you can't just barge in
on a man's tree house.

15:31.749 --> 15:33.037
I could've legally shot you.

15:33.108 --> 15:36.109
My tree, my rules.

15:36.212 --> 15:39.780
- Hi, Mr. Cleary.
- Stay for a while, son.

15:39.849 --> 15:43.166
I'm hurt you didn't invite me
to your party.

15:43.252 --> 15:44.818
You'll note mine's a cream soda.

15:44.887 --> 15:46.954
I-I was planning on doing some
scissor lifting later.

15:47.022 --> 15:49.523
You do realize gambling's
illegal in this state?

15:49.625 --> 15:52.693
T-True, but we're 14 feet
off the ground,

15:52.761 --> 15:54.795
so technically,
we're subject to astronaut law.

15:54.897 --> 15:56.730
We don't always play
for money, Mr. Cleary.

15:56.799 --> 15:58.582
A lot of the times,
Joey forgives our debts

15:58.667 --> 15:59.800
if we're able to offer him a favor.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.869
I got him that scissor lift
from my dad's job site.

16:01.937 --> 16:04.738
Mm. Looks like you called in
a lot of favors.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.424
I see radial tires, olive oil,

16:07.509 --> 16:09.776
a wiggling sack of something.

16:09.862 --> 16:11.378
As a responsible father,

16:11.447 --> 16:13.714
there's only one way
for me to handle this.

16:15.284 --> 16:16.450
Deal me in.

16:18.037 --> 16:18.785
Uh...

16:20.673 --> 16:23.624
Here's a little something
I call the "Cleary"

16:23.692 --> 16:26.059
because it's a...

16:26.161 --> 16:27.227
full house.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.514
Poor me with only two pair...

16:30.599 --> 16:31.765
of the same thing.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.067
That's better, isn't it?

16:35.921 --> 16:37.638
This feels like a good stopping point.

16:37.723 --> 16:40.324
- Because you have all the money!
- Yeah!

16:40.409 --> 16:41.942
I mean, you're not seriously keeping it?

16:41.994 --> 16:43.777
Uh, uh, your goal was to teach
me a lesson, right?

16:43.879 --> 16:45.579
Yeah, I like to get paid for my lessons.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.514
I won this by cheating fair and square.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.316
You cheated?

16:49.368 --> 16:51.618
Yeah.

16:53.522 --> 16:54.771
But it's okay,

16:54.857 --> 16:57.958
because we're under astronaut law.

16:58.060 --> 17:02.062
T-minus 10... 9...

17:02.164 --> 17:05.432
8... 7...

17:05.501 --> 17:07.367
<i>It was finally show night.</i>

17:07.469 --> 17:10.470
<i>A battle royale between me
and a cardboard boat.</i>

17:10.521 --> 17:13.307
<i>Fortunately, I had a secret
weapon up my sleeve.</i>

17:14.810 --> 17:17.711
- Timmy, I need to talk to you.
- Uh, s-s-sure... sure.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.980
I guess Mom isn't coming tonight
because of our fight.

17:20.031 --> 17:22.883
Sorry about that. I know how her
approval means a lot to you.

17:22.952 --> 17:25.018
I think I understand now
what it's like for you,

17:25.087 --> 17:26.618
doing something that inspires you

17:26.722 --> 17:29.940
while other people crap on it
and try to hold you back.

17:30.025 --> 17:31.692
Other people like me.

17:31.794 --> 17:33.493
You have been
one of my harshest critics.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.312
You and that smug second grader

17:35.431 --> 17:37.064
who writes those reviews
for the school paper.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.932
Well, she's a hack.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.484
Good luck tonight.

17:41.704 --> 17:43.337
Frank.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.207
I asked Dad to show us
his home movies last night

17:47.309 --> 17:49.776
so Mom would find out and stop
you from doing the show.

17:49.878 --> 17:51.912
I was jealous of your set
for upstaging me.

17:52.014 --> 17:54.914
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

17:54.967 --> 17:57.351
If you hadn't done that, I might
never have stood up to Mom.

17:58.354 --> 17:59.519
I can't believe you were jealous.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.204
No one's ever been jealous of me before.

18:01.323 --> 18:03.657
Except for Mrs. Strausser,
who raves about my skin.

18:03.726 --> 18:06.309
I'm not proud of what I did, Frank.

18:06.428 --> 18:07.894
Mostly because it didn't work.

18:10.966 --> 18:14.167
<i>Seriously, I wish it had
worked. I hated that damn boat.</i>

Just picture those shin guards.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.035
I brought Dad's projector back.

18:48.137 --> 18:50.337
Didn't go to the cast party
with your new theater friends?

18:50.422 --> 18:54.007
Meeting up in some coffee house,
wear berets, and play bongos?

18:54.076 --> 18:56.009
They're mostly just a soccer team.

18:56.111 --> 18:57.911
We had orange slices at intermission.

18:59.965 --> 19:01.548
I brought you this.

19:01.633 --> 19:03.083
A program from the show.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.885
They put my name in there.

19:07.740 --> 19:11.024
Some of what you said last night...

19:11.126 --> 19:12.225
might be true.

19:14.063 --> 19:17.731
About me sometimes holding you back.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.766
Then again, it's only natural.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.451
Every parent wants their
children to end up

19:21.537 --> 19:23.070
just a little less happy than they are.

19:23.172 --> 19:24.738
I'm not sure that's universal, Mom.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.874
What do I know?
I grew up in a different time.

19:27.976 --> 19:30.510
Expectations for girls
weren't set that high.

19:30.612 --> 19:34.614
And I met your father, and then
along came all you kids.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.551
Eight needy nails in my
hopes and dreams coffin.

19:41.623 --> 19:45.759
But I guess I could try to be
a little bit more encouraging.

19:47.513 --> 19:49.262
Let you boys march out into the world

19:49.348 --> 19:51.014
with sky-high expectations.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.934
And if they don't work out,
I'll be here for you.

19:54.019 --> 19:56.186
To come crawling back to.

19:56.271 --> 19:57.804
To tell me I was right.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.440
Or if they do work out,

20:00.526 --> 20:03.110
we can come back to say thank you.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.280
I love you, Mom.

20:09.701 --> 20:11.118
That word.

20:11.203 --> 20:12.786
You're probably starving.

20:12.871 --> 20:15.525
I'm gonna heat you up
a Hungry-Man dinner.

20:15.621 --> 20:19.456
It's a new one... Mexican enchiladas.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.479
- Hey, you see that one?
- Sure.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.124
X-27 Lancer.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.563
Any idea how many Gs
that baby's pulling?

20:29.656 --> 20:31.628
I don't know. 3?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.946
A million?

20:35.501 --> 20:37.968
What's this nonsense?

20:38.054 --> 20:40.104
Barry's Barnstormers
was supposed to be up next.

20:40.172 --> 20:44.108
These look like the movies that
William took of Timmy's show.

20:44.233 --> 20:47.234
Geez Louise, this looks amazing!

20:47.336 --> 20:51.371
It's not the "Crowned Clowns
of the Air," but... not bad.

20:51.473 --> 20:53.707
Well, we all knew Timmy
had a dose of creativity,

20:53.801 --> 20:55.889
but it looks like we have a second son

20:55.928 --> 20:57.959
- with a budding talent.
- Huh.

20:59.157 --> 21:02.732
I'm thinking William could
really be a filmmaker one day.
