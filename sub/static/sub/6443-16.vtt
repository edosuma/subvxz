02:26.503 --> 02:29.324
Who calls at 3 a. m.?

02:31.548 --> 02:34.125
- This had better be good.
- Lo, it's me.

02:35.841 --> 02:37.055
Lucy?

02:38.024 --> 02:39.400
Where are you?

02:39.419 --> 02:42.955
Good news big sis, I'm coming to see you the Day after tomorrow,
don't worry about the airport alright, I'll grab a shuttle

02:44.350 --> 02:46.311
- Lucy, wait!
- Can't wait to see you, bye!

03:57.180 --> 04:00.912
Hope you guys are hungry because there
are plenty more where these came from.

04:01.060 --> 04:04.110
Lois, you really didn't have to...
Do all this.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.053
At least let me help.
I should make some eggs.

04:07.493 --> 04:11.832
Oh, no no, Mrs. Kent,
you just sit down and relax.

04:11.894 --> 04:16.322
Look here I am using your home as my own
personal Motel 6, it's really the least I can do.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.918
Yeah well I'm not that hungry,
so I'm going to have some OJ.

04:20.178 --> 04:23.835
Come on, breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

04:25.496 --> 04:26.897
Bacon?

04:30.555 --> 04:36.644
OK so I'm never going to make it to the Cordon Bleu, but I
thought it would be less of a disaster than helping out on the farm.

04:39.211 --> 04:40.689
Maybe ironing.

04:42.243 --> 04:43.911
Lois what's going on?

04:44.581 --> 04:45.810
What do you mean?

04:46.442 --> 04:49.403
You made us breakfast,
you're offering to do chores...

04:50.286 --> 04:51.672
you want something.

04:52.837 --> 04:55.106
No, it's called being nice.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.991
Yeah, well if you were any nicer we'd starve.

04:58.274 --> 04:59.509
Clark.

05:05.654 --> 05:07.681
He's right, Mrs. Kent.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.998
Look.

05:13.826 --> 05:17.478
See, you guys have been
so good to me already...

05:18.983 --> 05:24.051
it's kind of hard to ask for
yet another favor so... but...

05:24.403 --> 05:26.961
Lo? Anybody home?

05:28.546 --> 05:31.094
Oh hi sweetie, what's your name?

05:33.273 --> 05:36.773
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

05:38.597 --> 05:44.823
Um, meet my sister Lucy, she was kind of hoping
she could crash here for a couple of days.

05:45.802 --> 05:50.940
I know it's last-minute but I had this school break...
and I'm willing to sleep in the barn.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.259
Now that's okay, Lois can sleep in the barn.

05:53.856 --> 05:56.742
- Nobody has to sleep out there.
- We'd love to have you Lucy.

05:57.943 --> 06:02.297
- You can stay in Lois's room.
- Look, we'll go up and get your things set up.

06:09.014 --> 06:12.094
So Lucy, Lois has told us
absolutely nothing about you.

06:12.291 --> 06:13.941
There's not much to tell.

06:14.788 --> 06:16.186
Oh, please, let me gloat.

06:16.364 --> 06:20.121
She is getting straight A's at one of the most
prestigious prep schools in Europe,

06:20.432 --> 06:25.244
she is fluent in three languages, and she is
fending off Ivy League colleges with a stick.

06:25.465 --> 06:28.364
Wow, that's impressive.
What happened to Lois?

06:30.818 --> 06:35.306
You're going to find that Clark's charm is an
acquired taste, much like his sense of fashion.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.078
Well, thanks for letting me stay,
I don't know how I'm going to repay you.

06:43.267 --> 06:45.929
Well, just tell me plenty of
embarrassing stories about Lois.

06:46.702 --> 06:48.094
Funny guy.

06:49.744 --> 06:54.201
Well, I'm just going to go wash four
time zones worth of airport connections...

06:54.414 --> 06:55.917
Lucy?

06:57.279 --> 06:58.989
Are you sure everything's OK?

07:00.913 --> 07:04.051
Now that I'm here with you, it's perfect.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.295
You know you cheated on that last stretch,
young lady. I had you beat.

07:20.902 --> 07:24.844
Well I only offered you a kiss,
didn't think you'd actually fall for it.

07:30.147 --> 07:31.419
Oh my God.

07:34.231 --> 07:35.313
Hold on.

07:40.129 --> 07:41.331
Is anything missing?

07:42.304 --> 07:43.750
I don't know.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.267
My jewelry is still here.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.677
My wallet is right where I left it.

07:52.892 --> 07:55.467
Okay well if nothing valuable
is missing then...

07:56.441 --> 07:57.567
The stone.

08:15.419 --> 08:16.851
Who else could have known it was here?

08:17.613 --> 08:20.009
- I don't know.
- Well no one saw me take it in China.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.494
Maybe Lex or Lionel figured it out.

08:25.443 --> 08:26.544
Or Clark.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.340
You always said there was a side
of him that you never really knew.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.815
I don't care who took this Jason.

08:36.067 --> 08:39.837
I don't care about these stones,
I just want to forget they ever existed.

08:39.990 --> 08:43.009
Lana, this isn't some bad dream that
you can just blink away,

08:43.333 --> 08:45.081
This is real life.

08:46.023 --> 08:48.967
- We have to find that stone.
- No, we don't.

08:49.656 --> 08:55.558
Jason, our relationship has become more about
chasing artifacts than it is about you and me.

08:56.712 --> 08:59.003
And that isn't a relationship.

08:59.669 --> 09:05.410
Remember when our biggest problem was
trying to find a place to steal a kiss?

09:09.358 --> 09:11.494
Yeah, I usually preferred under the bleachers.

09:12.597 --> 09:16.041
Well there is no reason why we
can't go back to those days,

09:16.285 --> 09:20.760
without worrying about break-ins
and artifacts and the Luthors...

09:22.248 --> 09:23.939
And Clark Kent.

09:29.624 --> 09:30.592
You're right.

09:34.644 --> 09:37.603
Then whoever took the stone,
they can just keep it...

09:39.743 --> 09:45.106
and we'll just concentrate on the
only thing that really matters...

09:45.424 --> 09:46.482
us.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.534
Hope you're thirsty.

10:00.186 --> 10:01.281
What are you doing?

10:01.550 --> 10:04.170
Well I figured I'd help out
and get the morning milk.

10:05.637 --> 10:09.216
I spent last spring break on my
friend's farm on the Swiss countryside.

10:09.805 --> 10:11.693
Well you know you didn't really have to do that.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.817
I figured if I'm going to stay,
I have to pull my own weight.

10:21.192 --> 10:23.086
Lois, did you hear that?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.062
I'm sorry, did you say something?

10:25.975 --> 10:27.614
Go get changed, I'm going to work.

10:28.267 --> 10:29.749
Since when did you work?

10:30.293 --> 10:34.992
Since today. I'm helping your mom out at the Talon.
So Chloe is going to be your official Smallville tour guide,

10:35.539 --> 10:37.282
not that there's much to see.

10:38.951 --> 10:42.461
Oh I don't know, so far it looks pretty good.

10:45.940 --> 10:49.050
Don't let all that flirting go to your head,
she goes to an all girls school,

10:49.349 --> 10:51.902
you're probably the first guy
she's talked to in a couple of months.

10:52.528 --> 10:57.200
Lois, I don't want you to get the wrong idea, but ever since
Lucy came to town, you've been grumpier than normal.

10:57.453 --> 10:59.104
Are you not happy to see your sister?

10:59.389 --> 11:05.219
Of course I am. Look there's a thing with sisters,
you can love them without liking them.

11:05.987 --> 11:08.023
You don't like your own sister?

11:09.699 --> 11:13.190
More like she's not very crazy about me.
And not that I blame her.

11:15.061 --> 11:19.884
Look, you might be a little rough around the edges,
but as far as sisters go... Lucy could do a lot worse.

11:21.201 --> 11:23.291
Thanks for the ringing endorsement.

11:25.507 --> 11:27.481
When my mother died,

11:27.882 --> 11:32.010
my dad had two girls he didn't know how to deal with,
so he did what every good military leader would do,

11:32.619 --> 11:35.435
he instituted a chain of command.
And I reported to him...

11:35.633 --> 11:36.776
Lucy reported to you.

11:37.059 --> 11:41.105
Yeah. Takes sibling rivalry to a whole new level.

11:41.808 --> 11:46.541
I had to make sure she had three square meals,
got to school, did her homework...

11:47.656 --> 11:49.287
you became her mother.

11:50.607 --> 11:54.721
Yeah except I was not prepared.

11:54.975 --> 11:59.017
I used to give her advice like,
"don't kiss a boy or you're going to get pregnant"

11:59.474 --> 12:02.813
And yeah, they be she had a few
more chores than most kids.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.343
Is that why she decided to go to boarding school?

12:07.186 --> 12:09.735
Oh... unlike you your family,
there was no discussion.

12:09.735 --> 12:12.972
When the general gives an order,
you are expected to carry it out.

12:13.909 --> 12:15.386
Sounds kind of harsh.

12:15.883 --> 12:19.389
Trust me, Lucy got the better end of the deal.

12:19.756 --> 12:22.607
Don't get me wrong... she totally deserves it.

12:23.315 --> 12:28.715
I guess there was just a part of me that was
always jealous that she got out and I didn't.

12:33.244 --> 12:34.857
I gotta go to work.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.196
I hear your mother's a slave driver.

12:42.123 --> 12:47.846
I need a half-caff soy latte, no foam, no whip,
and a blueberry muffin-top, hold the stem.

12:48.877 --> 12:52.162
Whatever happened to regular old black coffee.

12:52.415 --> 12:55.307
Two Lanes under one roof,
that's gotta be interesting.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.508
I haven't had a hot shower in 2 days,
the laundry machine is running nonstop,

12:58.842 --> 13:00.888
the phone line is consistently busy.

13:02.501 --> 13:06.446
Now it's nice having them around.
Kind of takes the loneliness out of the house.

13:06.725 --> 13:09.147
Yeah, I always hated the sound of a quiet home.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.116
Whoa, is that Lois with a tray? Hey, cuz...

13:13.767 --> 13:16.661
Yes it is, it's kind of like a free floor show.

13:18.971 --> 13:22.650
- Have you two been catching up?
- Yeah, Lucy's just filling me in on all her hidden talents.

13:23.584 --> 13:26.600
She was a violinist for the ZÃ¼rich youth Orchestra.

13:26.649 --> 13:28.323
It was nothing, it's just a hobby.

13:28.845 --> 13:31.466
Given their reputation in Europe,
I highly doubt that.

13:32.151 --> 13:34.424
- Oh sorry Lucy, this is -
- Lex Luthor.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.921
I read your profile in
Fortune magazine couple of months ago.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.530
I thought your theories on the future of
American business were very interesting.

13:47.690 --> 13:50.684
While I'd be curious to hear
what you think of my piano skills.

13:51.203 --> 13:54.211
Drop by at the mansion,
I'd love to play with a serious musician.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.884
Oh, crap!

13:59.909 --> 14:01.945
I'm gonna go help her out.

14:16.285 --> 14:19.649
Lucy.
Who's that guy staring at you back there?

14:40.943 --> 14:43.338
Luthor, where is it?

14:44.333 --> 14:47.385
Well, if perhaps you tell me what it is you want...

14:48.396 --> 14:50.418
You know exactly what it is I want.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.775
You gave me that map because
you knew I'd end up in China,

14:55.533 --> 14:57.255
and you knew I would find that stone.

14:58.859 --> 15:01.061
It was all one big calculated ploy wasn't it?

15:01.683 --> 15:06.203
If I had the foresight which you attribute to me,
I wouldn't need any ancient artifacts to help me.

15:06.550 --> 15:11.056
If you've got any kind of foresight, you'll let me know where that
stone is right now, otherwise this is going to get very ugly.

15:11.349 --> 15:14.961
Oh, so now in addition to hurling accusations,
you decide to threaten me?

15:16.955 --> 15:20.075
You break into her apartment,
you go through her private things...

15:20.334 --> 15:23.812
I assure you, breaking and entering
is not my style.

15:24.898 --> 15:30.535
You're lost treasure isn't here Mr. Teague,
you'll have to look somewhere else. Good day.

15:36.868 --> 15:41.262
I'm not going anywhere, Luthor, until you give me
that stone and you convince me that you didn't take it.

15:41.468 --> 15:45.780
You storm in here, you accuse me of
some ham-fisted home invasion.

15:46.817 --> 15:51.207
Why are you doing this? Is it an act?
An elaborate diversion?

15:51.455 --> 15:53.376
Don't turn this around on me!

15:55.138 --> 16:01.218
I think we both know there's nothing stronger
than the love between mother and son,

16:03.924 --> 16:06.118
and I'm sure Ms. Lang agrees.

17:41.413 --> 17:44.198
I knew you had talents, but I didn't think
burglary was one of them.

17:44.517 --> 17:47.282
I swear I was going to pay it all back,
I'm not some criminal.

17:47.545 --> 17:49.796
You do a pretty good job of impersonating one.

17:52.226 --> 17:55.331
Look Lucy, I just don't get it, I mean why?

17:57.995 --> 18:02.275
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be different from everyone else?

18:02.551 --> 18:04.510
To be a total outsider?

18:04.759 --> 18:06.095
I might have an idea.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.420
In my school, I'm surrounded
by the wealthiest kids in the world.

18:11.101 --> 18:16.747
So unless I wanna be the school's outcast,
I had to be like them, look like them.

18:16.791 --> 18:21.560
Well I'm sure that's a very expensive undertaking.
But do you really have to resort to petty theft in order to fit in?

18:21.631 --> 18:24.113
Well I tried using my credit cards but they maxed out!

18:25.747 --> 18:30.744
So I went to this club owner who's known
for lending money to the credit-impaired.

18:31.647 --> 18:33.657
- You went to a loan shark?
- It's called something else in German,

18:33.928 --> 18:36.389
but yeah, that's the idea.

18:37.047 --> 18:39.623
Wait, so that's the guy that was
here the other day staring at you.

18:44.061 --> 18:45.637
All right look, how much do you owe him?

18:46.902 --> 18:48.978
50,000 U.S. dollars.

18:49.743 --> 18:52.259
But most of its just bogus interest.

18:52.462 --> 18:55.797
- Lucy we've got to tell your father about this.
- No, I can't.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.969
The generals convinced I'm the
embodiment of the perfect daughter.

18:59.210 --> 19:00.744
Well at least we have to tell Lois.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.359
I don't want to disappoint her.

19:03.796 --> 19:05.641
She's your sister, she'll understand.

19:08.331 --> 19:10.886
Not everyone has a family like yours Clark.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.180
Please don't tell her.

19:22.474 --> 19:27.921
I think the best thing for me to do is to just...
disappear for a while.

19:28.478 --> 19:29.544
Lucy wait.

19:32.699 --> 19:36.638
If you're in some sort of trouble the best thing to do
is just stay here and keep a low profile.

19:40.098 --> 19:41.858
Maybe there's something I can do to help.

19:52.810 --> 19:56.832
His name is Marcus Becker, he's a bouncer
at a club called Kronos in ZÃ¼rich,

19:57.079 --> 20:01.448
with a rÃ©sumÃ© chock full of felonies. Apparently this club
is kind of a front for the kind of people

20:01.699 --> 20:03.967
that you don't want to own money to.

20:04.682 --> 20:06.382
We should just tell Lois.

20:06.731 --> 20:08.075
She doesn't have to.

20:09.204 --> 20:12.932
I knew her hop, skip, and jump over the Atlantic
wasn't because she missed her big sister,

20:13.184 --> 20:16.754
and if this guy is bothering Lucy, then I'm going
to find him, we're going to have a little talk.

20:16.934 --> 20:22.082
Lois. Before you go all "Lifetime Heroine", remember
that this is not the school bully she's dealing with.

20:22.310 --> 20:24.015
Seriously, she is in trouble.

20:24.466 --> 20:26.195
But I think I know someone who can help.

20:38.469 --> 20:40.856
Bravo, Lucy.
Excellent performance.

20:41.188 --> 20:43.733
Yeah, I had no idea the younger Lane
was such a virtuoso.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.335
Oh, apparently there's quite a bit
about the younger Lane we don't know.

20:49.162 --> 20:51.324
Thanks Clark, you're pretty great
about keeping a secret.

20:51.513 --> 20:53.370
Lucy I want to help you, that's why I'm here.

20:54.806 --> 20:57.783
Lex, I was going to tell you about the money
but I think she already beat me to it.

21:00.104 --> 21:02.396
And what money would that be?

21:02.623 --> 21:06.101
I didn't come here looking for a handout,
I can solve this problem by myself.

21:06.617 --> 21:10.875
Well as long as we're on the topic of personal finance,
how did you think you would be able to pay this money back?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.957
Standing on the street corner,
playing your violin for loose change?

21:14.132 --> 21:17.024
- There's a reason why I didn't tell you.
- Look, I don't wanna have to say anything to the general about-

21:17.387 --> 21:19.883
You're not mom alright, so stop trying to be!

21:20.224 --> 21:21.960
Don't you dare bring mom into this...

21:22.198 --> 21:24.269
Ladies, please...

21:25.165 --> 21:31.051
Lucy owes $50,000 to a guy in Switzerland.
He's come to Smallville to collect.

21:34.933 --> 21:36.204
Now Lucy...

21:36.959 --> 21:39.789
how does a girl like you get
involved with a loan shark?

21:42.269 --> 21:44.035
It's a long story.

21:44.681 --> 21:50.374
But look, I didn't ask for anyone's help, not Clark, not
Lois, not you. I'm a big girl, I can handle this on my own.

21:50.456 --> 21:53.927
$50,000 is a lot to handle, even for a big girl.

21:56.541 --> 21:58.630
Yeah, well I guess that's my problem.

21:58.954 --> 22:02.443
Lucy, before you walk out that door,
why don't you tell me what happened?

22:03.094 --> 22:05.919
I have the resources to deal with these kind of people.

22:10.858 --> 22:14.425
They want bearer bonds, which are impossible
to trace, this isn't amateur hour.

22:14.514 --> 22:16.547
I thought you had a policy not to deal with extortionists.

22:16.727 --> 22:20.199
This is different Clark. This isn't the
first time I've dealt with these people.

22:20.634 --> 22:22.912
- Wait, you know Marcus Becker?
- I know the men he works for.

22:23.602 --> 22:27.449
They are a German crime syndicate, and they've
repeatedly blocked my attempts to buy hotel in ZÃ¼rich

22:27.678 --> 22:32.560
through intimidation and blackmail. If I get this guy in
custody, I'll have something to squeeze them with.

22:33.181 --> 22:35.623
So Lucy's just a pawn?

22:35.944 --> 22:38.433
I just have other reasons for helping her out.

22:40.578 --> 22:44.568
Becker wants me to meet him at an abandoned
warehouse at the corner of Market and Lyndon.

22:44.785 --> 22:46.297
Lex, this isn't worth getting hurt over.

22:46.519 --> 22:49.440
No one is getting hurt Clark.
All I'm doing is delivering the briefcase,

22:49.686 --> 22:52.756
the GPS device inside will lead
my security team right to them.

22:52.968 --> 22:54.434
He said he only wants me there.

22:55.359 --> 22:57.575
No, that's not going to happen.

22:59.524 --> 23:00.712
I'm going alone.

23:05.112 --> 23:11.327
100 grand, chrome wheels, and 13 speakers, and
instead of a back seat, oh yeah, I get the gear shift.

23:11.709 --> 23:13.062
Are we there yet?

23:13.257 --> 23:16.081
Have you ever been in a car
and not uttered those words?

23:16.702 --> 23:19.739
All I'm saying is that this guy isn't going
to be happy if we are not there on time.

23:20.070 --> 23:22.283
He is not the kind of guy you want to piss off.

23:22.628 --> 23:24.348
Relax, we're close.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.580
Damnit.

23:37.618 --> 23:39.036
Can you outrun them?

23:39.927 --> 23:41.616
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

23:53.936 --> 23:55.431
Just stay put.

23:58.161 --> 23:59.626
Excuse me officer,

24:00.211 --> 24:05.370
I appreciate your need to fulfill your speeding ticket
quota but... can we make this quick?

24:05.633 --> 24:07.156
Put your hands over your head.

24:08.735 --> 24:09.726
What?

24:09.983 --> 24:12.309
Put your hands up, now!

24:14.185 --> 24:16.737
Look, I think there's been a mistake,
I may have been speeding but -

24:17.129 --> 24:18.205
Shut up!

24:19.340 --> 24:21.380
Go get the bonds, Mr. Luthor.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.454
Oh my God.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.093
No, no, no.
Just stay calm, okay?

24:41.191 --> 24:42.215
Nice try.

24:43.625 --> 24:45.034
Dump it in the bag.

24:58.692 --> 24:59.817
Thank you.

25:01.496 --> 25:02.717
and good night!

25:08.133 --> 25:10.850
You wouldn't want Lucy
to be an only child, would you?

25:30.024 --> 25:32.615
Take my word for it,
there's no cash on the premises.

25:33.343 --> 25:34.949
Where's Marcus Becker?

25:35.652 --> 25:36.888
Never heard of him.

25:48.850 --> 25:49.766
Lex!

25:50.932 --> 25:52.584
Clark, he's got the girls.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.066
Somebody!

26:21.364 --> 26:24.994
It's no use.
We are totally and utterly screwed.

26:27.583 --> 26:33.183
Oh, let's not jump to conclusions here. I have a history
of getting us out of the jams you get us into.

26:35.475 --> 26:36.694
I'll think of something.

26:36.978 --> 26:41.291
Lois, this isn't like us getting ourselves locked in the
mess hall pantry, or getting lost on our bikes in Bangkok.

26:48.931 --> 26:52.519
I don't get it, you got your money.
Why don't you go back home,

26:52.726 --> 26:56.327
eat some Swiss cheese, and live
happily ever after, you don't need us.

26:56.697 --> 27:01.314
But I do. The Luthor well has only
just been tapped. I'm here to strike it rich.

27:01.545 --> 27:03.675
You son of a bitch,
you're holding us for ransom?!

27:03.898 --> 27:04.874
Lucy, zip it.

27:11.751 --> 27:14.926
Let my sister go.
You don't need both of us.

27:15.018 --> 27:16.295
Sure I do.

27:17.491 --> 27:20.433
A pair of Lanes, it definitely ups the ante.

27:20.660 --> 27:23.954
The world would be a whole lot worse
without her in it than without me, okay?

27:24.705 --> 27:29.879
She's the one with a future.
If she'd only learn to behave herself.

27:34.892 --> 27:36.592
Eat up girls.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.329
How generous of you,
I thought you'd let us starve.

27:39.649 --> 27:42.145
The one with the sticker has no tomatoes.

27:46.242 --> 27:47.456
Lucy!

27:48.135 --> 27:49.119
Yeah?

27:49.693 --> 27:52.362
How did he know you don't like tomatoes?

27:57.571 --> 27:59.739
Lucy Lane has been conning us this whole time.

28:01.619 --> 28:04.002
That's a pretty bold accusation, Clark.

28:05.252 --> 28:07.954
The drop-off was a fake,
there was no warehouse.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.958
And Lucy was the only one who knew about the GPS.

28:12.249 --> 28:14.905
I mean, how else would Becker have
known to treat the briefcase like the plague?

28:15.190 --> 28:17.665
Becker's a pro, he could simply
be cautious about the money.

28:17.856 --> 28:20.851
It's all part of a bigger plan.
The way she accidentally woke me up

28:20.921 --> 28:23.798
on her way to steal from the Talon.
She knew I'd catch her in the act.

28:23.822 --> 28:26.580
Her sob story about
not being able to fit in at school.

28:26.770 --> 28:30.733
It was all a setup, in order to win my sympathies,
so I would come to you for the money.

28:33.884 --> 28:36.215
She played us like a Stratovarius.

28:36.863 --> 28:39.425
What I don't understand is why abduct Lois?

28:39.627 --> 28:42.050
I know it's a con,
but why kidnap your own sister?

28:42.301 --> 28:44.547
Well they say sibling rivalries run deep.

28:45.232 --> 28:47.375
Line 1, Mr. Luthor. It's Becker.

28:52.377 --> 28:53.795
Lex Luthor.

28:54.044 --> 29:01.076
Place $500,000 in bearer bonds inside the
trailer on Highway 54 just north of Cherry Hill.

29:01.246 --> 29:02.662
That's not how it works.

29:06.354 --> 29:07.710
Clark?

29:09.804 --> 29:11.143
Clark?

29:19.083 --> 29:22.121
I swear Lois, it wasn't
supposed to end up this way.

29:24.224 --> 29:28.218
When Michael Hoover was throwing
dirt clods at you, who kicked his butt, huh?

29:28.860 --> 29:33.590
Who was the one who let you sleep in her bed,
and listen to you snore every night after mom died?

29:35.907 --> 29:37.440
Lois, I'm sorry.

29:37.624 --> 29:39.794
Well sorry is not good enough!
I wanna know why.

29:41.803 --> 29:47.248
I wanna know why you turned to a life of crime
when you have everything in the world going for you!

29:47.306 --> 29:49.500
You're as close to friggin' perfect as it gets!

29:49.515 --> 29:52.030
Because that's what the general always wanted!

29:52.276 --> 29:54.867
I just went along and played the part.

29:56.826 --> 29:59.453
From the day I left for school,
all I wanted was to go home.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.720
Why didn't you tell the general that?

30:01.967 --> 30:05.763
How could I?
It was clear he didn't want me around.

30:07.537 --> 30:09.261
He wanted you.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.488
What are you talking about?

30:14.386 --> 30:17.193
Why do you think he sent me off to school after mom died?

30:17.441 --> 30:22.147
He sent you off to school because you were brilliant,
and deserved the best education available.

30:23.794 --> 30:25.821
Well you can think whatever you want.

30:26.725 --> 30:29.557
But the fact is I have always envied you.

30:31.447 --> 30:32.452
Me?

30:34.833 --> 30:38.984
I was being dragged around the world
like a spare piece of luggage.

30:39.745 --> 30:42.407
But you had something I never had.

30:42.748 --> 30:43.559
What?

30:45.138 --> 30:46.544
You had dad.

30:49.471 --> 30:50.563
Luce,

30:51.742 --> 30:54.439
I don't think either of us ever had Dad.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.900
Sorry I got you into this Lois.

31:27.116 --> 31:30.677
Don't worry about it,
you've been in far worse trouble than this.

32:47.552 --> 32:49.483
We're pulling over... now!

33:28.903 --> 33:30.002
How are you feeling?

33:30.305 --> 33:33.351
Well, I have a newfound
appreciation for seat belts, I can tell you that.

33:36.521 --> 33:38.172
What are you going to do with my sister?

33:38.973 --> 33:42.557
I don't have a choice.
I have to notify the authorities.

33:46.156 --> 33:47.356
Hey... wait!

33:48.580 --> 33:49.818
I'm sorry.

33:52.373 --> 33:53.655
Lucy!

34:15.301 --> 34:17.309
Lex.
Any luck finding Lucy?

34:17.763 --> 34:21.976
No, all that turned up was the car,
minus my $50,000.

34:25.120 --> 34:30.319
Look Lex, I know that Lois feels really badly about this,
but there's really no way she's going to be able to-

34:30.525 --> 34:35.983
Clark, I'm not here to collect. Besides, having Becker in
custody is worth a lot more to me than 50 grand.

34:37.984 --> 34:40.014
Your deal in ZÃ¼rich.

34:41.407 --> 34:43.437
Well I'm glad that someone came out of this ahead.

34:44.963 --> 34:46.411
So how's Lois?

34:46.973 --> 34:50.264
Um, I don't know,
she hasn't said anything all day.

34:53.348 --> 34:56.362
But I don't know why Lucy would run away,
I mean Lois is her family.

34:58.316 --> 35:01.932
Just because you have the same blood running
through your veins, doesn't make you family.

35:03.897 --> 35:05.616
Look at us Clark.

35:06.900 --> 35:09.227
I'm a product of my fathers breeding.

35:10.112 --> 35:11.638
He needed an heir.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.933
But your parents chose you out of love.

35:16.058 --> 35:18.630
I'd take your family any day of the week.

35:23.650 --> 35:26.045
I just think Lois and Lucy could have been closer.

35:26.297 --> 35:28.138
We'll hopefully one day they will be.

35:28.446 --> 35:33.044
But that's up to them. So quit blaming
yourself for what happened.

35:35.474 --> 35:36.437
Lex.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.924
Do you ever miss not having a sibling?

35:46.084 --> 35:47.688
I used to.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.662
Until I met you, Clark.

35:52.697 --> 35:55.906
You're closer to me than any blood brother.

36:19.097 --> 36:20.684
- Hey!
- Hey.

36:20.878 --> 36:22.640
Have you recovered from hurricane Lucy yet?

36:22.864 --> 36:24.996
Oh I just hope she changes her ways
before she gets herself hurt.

36:25.805 --> 36:29.419
You know it never fails, keeping secrets
always leads to trouble.

36:29.731 --> 36:33.581
I don't know which is more difficult, being the one
keeping the secret, or the one who's being duped.

36:34.248 --> 36:35.647
Have you talked to Lois?

36:36.289 --> 36:39.852
She's been holed up in her room all day.
She took it all pretty hard.

36:40.295 --> 36:44.837
Well ever since I can remember, the one thing Lois has
always wanted is to protect her little sister.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.853
I guess no matter how bad you want to,
you just can't save everyone.

36:51.244 --> 36:54.919
But it doesn't stop you from trying,
does it Clark?

37:03.912 --> 37:07.212
Dad, clearly the idea of personal space is lost on you.

37:07.499 --> 37:13.110
Lex, one of your employees paid me a visit recently,
and I wasn't clear whether it was official business,

37:13.184 --> 37:15.067
or what it was.

37:15.371 --> 37:17.882
As far as I know, our outstanding business is finished.

37:18.306 --> 37:24.637
Well, he... Jason Teague, that's who it was, accused me
of taking something that didn't belong to me.

37:24.864 --> 37:25.830
Of stealing.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.755
Well it wouldn't be the first time.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.795
Be that as it may, the accusation was false.

37:35.850 --> 37:40.242
But given what's missing, I almost wish I was guilty.

37:41.119 --> 37:42.333
What was it?

37:43.638 --> 37:47.151
You know the answer to that question, Lex,
you're the one who took it from him.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.940
Dad, if you want to play games,
there's a deck of cards in the parlor.

37:52.221 --> 37:57.590
Let's talk about games. You hire someone to
travel to China to search for an ancient artifact.

37:57.867 --> 38:03.196
He finds it, he steals it, but he keeps it for himself.
Then you have to steal it back from him.

38:04.939 --> 38:08.156
You've turned "hot potato" into an art form, son.

38:09.508 --> 38:12.241
Jason Teague found the stone?

38:15.514 --> 38:21.801
Either you are the best con man in the world,
or you are truly unbelievably naÃ¯ve.

38:26.542 --> 38:28.134
Good afternoon, Lex.

39:28.748 --> 39:32.545
I thought you said that telescopes
were for geeks and stalkers.

39:32.837 --> 39:36.529
Yeah well, as was proven over the last few days,
I can seriously misjudge people.

39:37.402 --> 39:40.708
You know, if you've come to kick me off the farm,
I completely understand.

39:42.888 --> 39:47.031
Yeah, um... actually I came here to tell you
we have food in the oven, if you're hungry.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.742
Thanks.

39:52.337 --> 39:53.511
How are you holding up?

39:53.700 --> 39:55.308
Oh, just got off the phone with the general.

39:55.939 --> 39:57.791
Oh, that was all the screaming
I heard from the house.

39:58.002 --> 40:03.453
Yeah, well apparently he is very
disappointed in me for letting this happen,

40:03.817 --> 40:07.869
and as far as the family chain of command
goes, I am the weakest link.

40:10.486 --> 40:12.273
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

40:13.041 --> 40:19.041
You know, there's something cathartic
about telling a 3-star general to go to hell.

40:20.817 --> 40:24.028
You know, all these years I thought
I had my sister pegged but...

40:25.505 --> 40:28.580
in reality, she's a complete stranger to me.

40:30.762 --> 40:35.079
Even if that were true, I think that if she called
you tomorrow, you'd be there in the second to help her.

40:37.772 --> 40:40.825
Yeah I would. She's my sister.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.417
I don't think Lucy is all that bad.

40:48.089 --> 40:50.249
You're amazing, "Smallville".

40:51.230 --> 40:54.819
You always look for the best in people,
even when they walk all over you.

40:55.217 --> 40:57.353
I guess that explains why we're friends.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.292
Oh, we're friends now?

40:59.705 --> 41:02.247
Well, I won't tell anyone if you don't.
