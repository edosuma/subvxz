20:10.310 --> 20:11.578
HUH, THERE, LITTLE FELLA?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.846
YEAH,
I HAVE A GAME SATURDAY.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.848
OOH, WELL, YOUR DADDY'S
GONNA MISS IT

20:15.848 --> 20:19.252
BECAUSE HE'S WORKING WEEKENDS
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.655
BET YOU LIKE EATING DINNER
WITH YOUR DAD, TOO.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.190
SAY "NO," MAX!
SAY "NO"!

20:24.190 --> 20:25.725
TOO LATE!

20:28.595 --> 20:30.530
HE'S ON THE NIGHT SHIFT.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.733
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
WE NEED YOU TO DO.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.504
SO YOU SEE, IT WAS ALL
A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.373
JACK AND MEL WANT YOU TO STAY ON
AS THE COMPANY DENTIST.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.708
REALLY?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.076
WELL, IF YOU REALLY TRUST ME
AS YOUR DENTIST,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.312
YOU'LL GET IN THE CHAIR.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.679
YOU'RE DUE FOR A CLEANING.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.748
THAT'S OKAY.
I DO ALL MY OWN DENTAL WORK.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.850
I CLEAN MY TEETH,
FILL MY CAVITIES.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.620
I EVEN SEND MYSELF A POSTCARD
EVERY SIX MONTHS

20:53.620 --> 20:56.188
THAT SAYS, "I MISS YOU,
AND THAT'S THE TOOTH."

20:56.188 --> 20:58.425
GET IN THE CHAIR.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.462
GET IN THE CHAIR.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.196
IT'S OKAY. NO PROBLEM.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.666
I TRUST YOU.
NO HARD FEELINGS.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.835
WOW, THAT IS
A GREAT PICTURE.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.538
WHEN DID YOU MEET
DESMOND TUTU?

21:13.440 --> 21:16.976
THAT IS MY WIFE.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.911
THAT'S A HANDSOME WOMAN.

21:20.112 --> 21:20.647
[ DRILL WHIRRING ]
