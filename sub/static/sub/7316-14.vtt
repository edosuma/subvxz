It's Jake Malloy!

01:40.390 --> 01:42.924
Hey, what is it,
Casual Tuesday at NSA?

01:42.926 --> 01:44.992
Couples yoga at the YMCA.
Mm-hmm.

01:44.994 --> 01:46.494
It ran late.
We're changing here.

01:46.496 --> 01:48.663
You guys have been doing
a lot of couples classes lately.

01:48.665 --> 01:50.364
Always working
to improve our marriage.

01:50.366 --> 01:51.899
And it sucks.

01:53.335 --> 01:55.770
The classes. Not our marriage.

01:55.772 --> 01:58.506
(both chuckle)
Last week, it was...

01:58.508 --> 01:59.607
couples massage.

01:59.609 --> 02:01.676
JAKE: Yeah, that was
just creepy.

02:01.678 --> 02:03.077
Yeah. So after this morning,

02:03.079 --> 02:05.813
we decided
we are taking a break.

02:08.015 --> 02:09.317
From, uh, the classes.

02:09.318 --> 02:10.550
Not each other.

02:10.553 --> 02:12.019
(both chuckle)

02:12.021 --> 02:13.754
And then Ellie had
a brilliant idea...

02:13.756 --> 02:15.056
I'm glad that you guys

02:15.058 --> 02:16.324
are figuring all this
couple stuff out,

02:16.326 --> 02:18.259
but if you'll
excuse me...

02:18.261 --> 02:20.061
Don't you want
to hear what the idea was?

02:20.063 --> 02:23.698
You know, isn't the mystery
of not knowing more exciting?

02:23.700 --> 02:25.032
Ellie, I would love to hear

02:25.034 --> 02:27.101
what your idea was.
Don't you dare, McGee.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.502
I'm being courteous, Tony.

02:28.504 --> 02:29.837
It's a trap, Tim.

02:29.839 --> 02:31.706
We want to take you to dinner.

02:33.742 --> 02:35.776
What's the catch?
No catch. Our treat.

02:35.778 --> 02:37.912
At NSA,
we had the same colleagues.

02:37.914 --> 02:40.648
But Jake doesn't really know
you guys.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.917
TONY: So you want to take
me and McGee

02:42.919 --> 02:44.452
to dinner,
no strings attached.

02:44.454 --> 02:46.888
And Gibbs.
(laughing): And Gibbs.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.155
Well, there you go.

02:48.157 --> 02:49.290
Don't know if you've noticed,

02:49.292 --> 02:51.859
but the boss
hasn't been the fun,

02:51.861 --> 02:55.096
social Gibbs
that we all love and fear.

02:55.098 --> 02:58.032
Yeah, well, he has had
a lot on his mind lately.

02:58.034 --> 03:00.034
McGEE:
That's an understatement.

03:00.036 --> 03:02.603
Doesn't matter though-- there is
no way he's gonna say yes.

03:02.605 --> 03:04.205
GIBBS:
Already have.

03:04.207 --> 03:05.773
Expecting you to be there.

03:05.775 --> 03:07.475
I'll have bells on, boss.
I love dinner, boss.

03:07.477 --> 03:09.577
Good. We'll go over the
details later. Come on.

03:09.579 --> 03:11.579
Got a dead Marine
in Gwynns Falls.

03:13.448 --> 03:15.283
Can I have a minute to change?

03:16.451 --> 03:19.153
I'll change in the car.

03:20.122 --> 03:21.322
Bye.

03:22.991 --> 03:24.158
Wait.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.326
You'll what?

03:29.364 --> 03:31.599
McGEE: The victim
is Private John Wallis.

03:31.601 --> 03:33.034
19 years old.

03:33.036 --> 03:35.303
State troopers were
alerted early this morning

03:35.305 --> 03:36.671
when a hiker
discovered the body.

03:36.673 --> 03:38.005
Police found Wallis's watch,

03:38.007 --> 03:41.242
wallet, and $300 cash,
but no cell phone.

03:41.244 --> 03:43.978
Nothing like
the frigid morning air

03:43.980 --> 03:45.780
and treacherous terrain

03:45.782 --> 03:49.951
for me to regret giving
Mr. Palmer paternity leave.

03:49.953 --> 03:51.152
No good deed, Duck.

03:51.154 --> 03:53.020
Yeah.
Who have we got here?

03:55.290 --> 03:56.791
TONY: Oh, man...

03:56.793 --> 03:58.225
Quite a blood-letting.

03:58.227 --> 04:00.795
Tony, would you, uh,
help me? Just...

04:00.797 --> 04:03.597
roll him up....
here, you see?

04:03.599 --> 04:05.066
Our victim is covered in blood.

04:05.068 --> 04:07.902
Apparently the result
of multiple wounds.

04:07.904 --> 04:10.871
And yet there's no blood
underneath or around him.

04:10.873 --> 04:14.208
So Wallis was dumped here
after he was killed.

04:15.744 --> 04:18.579
Blood trail leads this way.

04:18.581 --> 04:21.015
You think the initial crime
scene is deeper in the woods?

04:21.017 --> 04:22.650
DUCKY:
<i>"Verum,</i>

04:22.652 --> 04:24.785
<i>Animus, Officium."</i>

04:24.787 --> 04:26.554
Truth, Valor, Duty.

04:26.556 --> 04:28.155
I didn't know
you spoke Latin, Tony.

04:28.157 --> 04:29.790
Well, I know those words.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.626
That's the motto of
the Remington Military Academy.

04:32.628 --> 04:34.695
It's the last prep school
I ever went to.

04:34.697 --> 04:37.098
I guess Wallis went there, too.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.466
McGEE:
Tony in a uniform.

04:38.468 --> 04:39.734
I'd pay to see that.

04:43.405 --> 04:45.206
He's got something
in his hand here, boss.

04:47.843 --> 04:50.044
Looks like a photo.

04:51.179 --> 04:53.014
I can't make it out.

04:53.016 --> 04:56.784
Whatever it is,
he was holding on for dear life.

05:08.155 --> 05:10.289
TONY:
See this? Killer dragged

05:10.290 --> 05:12.257
Wallis's body from
somewhere down here.

05:12.725 --> 05:14.593
Huh.

05:14.595 --> 05:17.195
So, military school, huh?

05:17.197 --> 05:18.797
So, yeah.

05:18.799 --> 05:22.634
Uniforms, PT, drills...

05:22.636 --> 05:25.837
Those are all things that
happen at military school, yes.

05:25.839 --> 05:28.673
How'd you end up there?
It was Senior's Hail Mary,

05:28.675 --> 05:29.975
trying to straighten me out

05:29.977 --> 05:31.877
after six boarding schools
in four years.

05:31.879 --> 05:33.445
Huh.

05:33.447 --> 05:37.482
It just doesn't really jibe with
my mental picture of Tony at 17.

05:37.484 --> 05:40.752
You must have hated it,
the pomp and circumstance.

05:40.754 --> 05:42.921
Hey, look at this.

05:42.923 --> 05:44.756
This looks like some kind
of tarp.

05:44.758 --> 05:46.491
Might've been used
to wrap the body up.

05:50.797 --> 05:53.398
I got tire tracks over here.

05:56.135 --> 05:58.437
Tire tracks.

05:58.439 --> 06:00.839
So let's say the killer
used this access road,

06:00.841 --> 06:03.508
dragged the body up
to where we found it...

06:03.510 --> 06:05.210
Set a fire to burn the evidence.

06:05.212 --> 06:07.813
DUCKY:
<i>Well, I thoroughly enjoyed</i>

06:07.815 --> 06:09.781
my Latin classes in school.

06:09.783 --> 06:13.618
Translating
Caesar's <i>Gallic Wars, Book 5.</i>

06:13.620 --> 06:15.754
(chuckles)
It's amazing.

06:15.756 --> 06:18.690
2,000 years
of so-called civilization

06:18.692 --> 06:21.126
and we're still fighting
the same wars.

06:21.128 --> 06:22.661
GIBBS: What do you got
for me, Duck?

06:22.663 --> 06:26.131
Well, young Private Wallis
was stabbed 20 times.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.200
Most of the wounds
are in the upper abdomen,

06:28.202 --> 06:30.035
damaging his
spleen and liver.

06:30.037 --> 06:32.604
However,
it's this cut to his neck

06:32.606 --> 06:35.841
that severed the carotid artery
and caused all that...

06:35.843 --> 06:37.576
dramatic bleeding.

06:37.578 --> 06:39.945
Weapon?
Weapon. A knife.

06:39.947 --> 06:42.114
Straight-edged.
Six inches.

06:42.116 --> 06:46.051
It left a distinctive mark
on two of the wounds.

06:46.053 --> 06:47.886
It could be an imprint
of the hilt.

06:47.888 --> 06:49.855
Abby's looking into it.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.923
Anything else?
Well, no.

06:51.925 --> 06:53.325
And that's what's strange.

06:53.327 --> 06:56.728
There's no bruised knuckles or
cuts on his hands and fingers.

06:56.730 --> 06:59.498
He didn't put up a fight.
Peculiar for a Marine

06:59.500 --> 07:01.433
that's trained
as a lethal weapon.

07:01.435 --> 07:04.336
But someone was able
to get close enough to him

07:04.338 --> 07:06.438
to cause all these wounds.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.006
He was taken by surprise.

07:08.008 --> 07:11.076
And most likely
by someone he knew.

07:12.845 --> 07:14.713
Private Wallis was
a scholarship student

07:14.715 --> 07:16.748
at Remington
Military Academy.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.050
Top of his class. He joined
the Marine Corps just three days

07:19.052 --> 07:21.019
after he graduated
last spring.

07:21.021 --> 07:22.921
TONY:
Where he also excelled.

07:22.923 --> 07:25.123
Top of his class
in the school of infantry.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.659
His unit was part
of the 22nd MEU,

07:27.661 --> 07:30.495
set to deploy on the
USS <i>Edgerton</i> out of Norfolk.

07:30.497 --> 07:32.664
Five days ago, he received
a call to his cell phone.

07:32.666 --> 07:33.932
Then he emptied
his bank account--

07:33.934 --> 07:36.234
1,500 bucks--
and went UA.

07:36.236 --> 07:38.036
Didn't use his credit
cards or cell phone.

07:38.038 --> 07:39.471
Just vanished.
BISHOP: But what we do have

07:39.473 --> 07:40.939
is the last call
he received

07:40.941 --> 07:43.341
before he went quiet.
Traced the phone number

07:43.343 --> 07:45.510
back to the Remington
Military Academy.

07:45.512 --> 07:47.546
It's a house phone
in one of the dorms.

07:47.548 --> 07:49.648
Any one of 100 cadets
could have placed that call.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.416
But whatever was said,
Wallis went UA

07:51.418 --> 07:52.651
immediately afterwards.

07:52.653 --> 07:53.985
Okay. Go to the school.

07:53.987 --> 07:55.220
I want to know
who made the call.

07:55.222 --> 07:56.721
Uh... uh...

07:56.723 --> 07:59.024
Do both of us really need
to go there? I mean,

07:59.026 --> 08:01.293
do we really need two agents to
go all the way to Rhode Island?

08:01.295 --> 08:03.061
Is there a problem, DiNozzo,

08:03.063 --> 08:05.163
with you going back
to your Alma mater?

08:05.165 --> 08:08.433
Well, hey, let us go talk
about it. Let's-let's, uh...

08:08.435 --> 08:10.802
let's have a cup of coffee.
Let's... hash it out.

08:10.804 --> 08:13.438
I don't need to hash it out.
I just need to...

08:13.440 --> 08:17.342
prepare myself for
the psychological...

08:17.344 --> 08:18.543
Hey.

08:18.545 --> 08:20.178
You got six hours in a car,

08:20.180 --> 08:21.813
you got one night
in a hotel room

08:21.815 --> 08:24.115
to prepare psychologically.

08:24.117 --> 08:26.618
Make it count, Skippy.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.453
Thank you, boss.

08:28.455 --> 08:30.855
(groans)

08:30.857 --> 08:33.357
(knocking)
No time for chitchat, McGee.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.927
Mama's cookin' on all six burners here.
Strictly business, Abby.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.096
Just wondering if you found
anything useful off the ashes

08:38.097 --> 08:40.365
Tony and Bishop found
near the crime scene.

08:40.366 --> 08:43.134
Other than watery eyes
and an itchy throat, nothing.

08:43.135 --> 08:44.722
And before you say anything,

08:44.746 --> 08:46.640
I haven't matched the tire
tracks from the crime scene.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.440
And don't even ask
about the murder weapon.

08:48.442 --> 08:50.508
I was planning on
stabbing dummies all day,

08:50.510 --> 08:51.643
but now I don't know.

08:51.645 --> 08:53.278
Abby...

08:53.280 --> 08:54.646
I was gonna ask if I can help.

08:54.648 --> 08:57.616
Oh... well, that's nice.

08:57.618 --> 09:00.852
Why don't you come over here and
help me get blood off this photo.

09:03.389 --> 09:06.424
It's not glamorous
and it's not fun,

09:06.426 --> 09:08.560
but it's the best way
to get blood off a photo.

09:08.562 --> 09:11.896
Maybe if this takes long enough,
I can skip tomorrow night.

09:11.898 --> 09:14.366
What's tomorrow night?

09:19.105 --> 09:22.040
McGee?

09:22.042 --> 09:24.342
Okay.

09:24.344 --> 09:28.179
Jake and Bishop invited us
to dinner tomorrow night.

09:28.181 --> 09:30.448
I think it's an agents-only thing, but...
Relax, McGee.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.917
You're not upset
you weren't invited?

09:32.919 --> 09:35.186
No. Why would I be?

09:35.188 --> 09:38.156
Burt and I hang out with
Bishop and Jake all the time.

09:38.158 --> 09:40.125
We even took a class together.

09:40.127 --> 09:42.560
Please tell me
it wasn't couples massage.

09:42.562 --> 09:45.263
Dab, McGee. Dab.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.769
BISHOP: <i>Abby was able to clear up the</i>
<i>photo found in Wallis's hand.</i>

09:54.940 --> 09:56.941
Pretty girl.
Someone from the base?

09:56.943 --> 09:59.010
Not a Marine uniform.

09:59.012 --> 10:00.679
That's RMA.

10:00.681 --> 10:03.248
Maybe she's Wallis's classmate.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.050
Abby wasn't able
to identify her.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.785
Well, they'll know
at the school.

10:08.054 --> 10:11.056
You feeling nervous to go back?

10:11.058 --> 10:12.090
(sighs)

10:12.092 --> 10:13.591
I'm a grown man, Bishop.

10:13.593 --> 10:16.628
Takes a little bit more
than a visit to my old school

10:16.630 --> 10:18.630
to make me nervous.

10:28.574 --> 10:30.475
So, DiNozzo,

10:30.477 --> 10:33.378
you may very well be the first
cadet to get limo service

10:33.380 --> 10:35.213
from the train station.

10:35.215 --> 10:38.283
Guess your dad wields
some influence.

10:38.285 --> 10:41.353
We'll give you a
proper tour tomorrow.

10:41.355 --> 10:44.255
You'll be in Hull House
with the rest of the seniors.

10:52.431 --> 10:54.833
Here we are.

10:54.835 --> 10:57.435
"Leave the gun.
Take the cannoli."

10:58.804 --> 11:00.372
<i>The Godfather?</i>

11:02.208 --> 11:04.275
Come on, kid, it's a classic.

11:09.715 --> 11:13.418
Uniforms, PT gear and basic
toiletries are in your room.

11:13.420 --> 11:16.321
We had to guess sizes.

11:16.323 --> 11:18.056
This is you.

11:18.058 --> 11:20.291
Your bunkmate's name
is Travis Phelps.

11:20.293 --> 11:22.827
Look... first night

11:22.829 --> 11:24.295
is usually the hardest.

11:24.297 --> 11:26.631
If you need me,
I'm down the hall.

11:26.633 --> 11:29.667
I'm 17, not seven.

11:29.669 --> 11:31.403
And this isn't my
first new dorm room,

11:31.405 --> 11:33.204
new clothes and
new teachers.

11:33.206 --> 11:34.839
So back off, buddy, okay?

11:34.841 --> 11:36.441
The name's not buddy.

11:36.443 --> 11:37.842
It's Mr. Tanner.

11:37.844 --> 11:40.345
And from now on
you are Cadet DiNozzo.

11:40.347 --> 11:42.547
Grab some rack time.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.921
(Tanner chuckles)

11:49.923 --> 11:52.424
Can't believe my eyes.

11:52.426 --> 11:55.527
Anthony frickin' DiNozzo
back on my campus.

11:55.529 --> 11:56.594
I'm happy to see you.

11:56.596 --> 11:57.829
Nice to see you, Coach.

11:57.831 --> 11:59.164
Please, call me Gerald.

11:59.166 --> 12:03.668
Gerald, this is
NCIS Special Agent Bishop.

12:03.670 --> 12:06.538
Ah... NCIS.
Very impressive.

12:06.540 --> 12:09.040
I always knew this one
would make me proud.

12:09.042 --> 12:11.376
(wry laugh) You did?
Yeah.

12:11.378 --> 12:13.511
Well, we're not
here to reminisce.

12:13.513 --> 12:16.514
Of course not. Uh, you're here
about John Wallis.

12:16.516 --> 12:18.383
Tragic. How can I help?

12:18.385 --> 12:20.819
Uh, wondering if you
know this girl.

12:22.354 --> 12:24.022
That's Christine Sanders.

12:24.024 --> 12:26.124
We need to talk to her
as soon as possible.

12:26.126 --> 12:27.692
I'm afraid that's impossible.

12:27.694 --> 12:29.027
Why?

12:29.029 --> 12:31.095
Christine Sanders is dead.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.815
Christine was a junior.

12:47.817 --> 12:49.884
A go-getter. She was
on the dean's list,

12:49.886 --> 12:51.352
just like DiNozzo.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.187
And she was on track
to becoming our first

12:53.189 --> 12:55.156
female valedictorian.

12:55.158 --> 12:57.558
Uh... (laughs) I'm sorry,
can we back up a second?

12:57.560 --> 12:58.760
Did you say...

12:58.762 --> 13:00.862
Tony made dean's list?
(chuckles)

13:00.864 --> 13:02.396
He shaped into a model cadet.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.366
Let's stay on point here.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.034
What about Christine?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.503
Her grades
started slipping.

13:08.505 --> 13:10.872
She became withdrawn.
Quit the track team.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.040
Ten days ago,
the senior cadet

13:13.042 --> 13:15.476
discovered her
in her room, dead.

13:15.478 --> 13:16.911
She'd overdosed
on pills.

13:16.913 --> 13:18.212
No one saw the signs?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.815
Look, half the students
in our academy

13:20.817 --> 13:23.117
are here because
they are troubled.

13:23.119 --> 13:24.452
Even Christine had
her rough times.

13:24.454 --> 13:25.820
That's why she was here.

13:25.822 --> 13:29.524
We have built our reputation
on turning young lives around.

13:29.526 --> 13:31.225
Just look at him.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.728
What about John Wallis?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.429
Oh, he's a great kid;
great athlete.

13:35.431 --> 13:37.198
He was senior cadet
last year.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.100
We all saw
a bright future for him.

13:40.068 --> 13:41.669
What was Christine's
relationship with him?

13:41.671 --> 13:43.371
Wallis was her
commanding officer.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.706
Uh, she was one of 40
cadets under his care.

13:45.708 --> 13:46.874
Come on, Coach.

13:47.876 --> 13:50.077
He had her photo
in his hand when he died.

13:52.181 --> 13:54.715
The school became coed in '95.

13:54.717 --> 13:56.584
And honestly, we're

13:56.586 --> 14:00.588
still navigating the raging
hormones on campus.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.124
But there is
one clear rule:

14:03.126 --> 14:06.060
Dating amongst the ranks
is strictly forbidden.

14:06.062 --> 14:09.063
Did Wallis come back
to campus in the last few days?

14:09.065 --> 14:11.365
Uh, not that I know of.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.334
Look, I-I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

14:13.336 --> 14:15.236
Um, do you think
Wallis's death

14:15.238 --> 14:16.838
had something
to do with Christine?

14:16.840 --> 14:18.506
Christine died
ten days ago.

14:18.508 --> 14:21.342
A few days later, Wallis
received a call from her dorm.

14:21.344 --> 14:22.543
Then he went UA.

14:22.545 --> 14:24.278
If Christine was already dead,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.747
anyone on campus
could have called Wallis.

14:32.921 --> 14:35.122
Remind me never
to piss you off, Abbs.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.891
Couldn't if you
tried, Gibbs.

14:36.893 --> 14:39.327
I'm just trying
to match the knife

14:39.329 --> 14:41.362
that was used to
kill private Wallis.

14:41.364 --> 14:43.364
But no luck, so far.

14:43.366 --> 14:45.833
Okay, let's track Wallis's
movements after he went UA.

14:45.835 --> 14:47.768
His cell phone's off.
Then, uh,

14:47.770 --> 14:51.672
can we hack into, uh,
his GPS RAM thingy

14:51.674 --> 14:54.709
and back-trace
his memory deal?

14:54.711 --> 14:57.245
Um...

14:57.247 --> 14:59.180
None of those things are...

14:59.182 --> 15:01.315
things, Gibbs.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.185
And one of 'em's a band.

15:04.187 --> 15:06.354
And when someone
turns their phone off,

15:06.356 --> 15:08.689
there's nothing you can do.
I mean, it's off.

15:08.691 --> 15:12.059
Of course...
just because it's off

15:12.061 --> 15:15.096
doesn't mean I can't
turn it back on.

15:15.098 --> 15:15.742
It doesn't?

15:15.766 --> 15:18.313
Depending on what type
of phone Wallis had,

15:18.568 --> 15:20.968
I may be able to remotely
turn it back on.

15:20.970 --> 15:22.403
And, yes, then

15:22.405 --> 15:25.406
we can hack into his GPS
thingy memory deal.

15:25.408 --> 15:26.974
Okay.

15:26.976 --> 15:28.609
Okay, let's do it.

15:29.611 --> 15:31.245
McGEE:
Hey, Abs.

15:31.247 --> 15:34.248
Boss, just got off the phone
with New England TeleCard.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.950
What is New England TeleCard?

15:35.952 --> 15:38.552
They provide calling cards
to the cadets at RMA.

15:38.554 --> 15:40.821
They were also able to give me
the name of the cadet

15:40.823 --> 15:42.823
who called Wallis
the night he went UA.

15:42.825 --> 15:45.359
Caller was Cadet Lucas Craig.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.761
Tell DiNozzo and Bishop.

15:46.763 --> 15:48.429
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

15:48.431 --> 15:50.031
I turned Wallis's
phone back on.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.599
I'm tracing
its location now.

15:51.601 --> 15:54.335
It's at a residence
that belongs to...

15:54.337 --> 15:57.438
Frederick Cantor;
Richmond, Virginia.

15:58.941 --> 16:00.541
Lucas Craig
is Senior Cadet.

16:01.576 --> 16:03.678
Means he's the highest-ranking
student on campus.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.446
Were you Senior Cadet, Tony?

16:05.448 --> 16:07.214
No, he was too busy

16:07.216 --> 16:09.617
shaking and baking on the
basketball court for me.

16:09.619 --> 16:11.619
But he was a flag bearer.

16:13.155 --> 16:14.855
What are you doing?

16:14.857 --> 16:16.624
Uh, McGee wants a detailed report.
Stop it.

16:16.626 --> 16:18.492
Hey.
Craig's overseeing

16:18.494 --> 16:19.994
close-order drill outside.

16:19.996 --> 16:21.329
He'll be done soon.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.863
Uh, I've got a
faculty meeting.

16:22.865 --> 16:24.498
Will you be around
afterwards?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.067
Actually, we're
heading back to DC.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.536
Well, that's too bad.
I wanted to catch up.

16:28.538 --> 16:30.071
Pleasure.

16:31.039 --> 16:32.373
Really good to see you.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.741
Coach.

16:38.613 --> 16:39.680
Oh, my God.

16:39.682 --> 16:41.248
That's you.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.817
You look so...

16:42.819 --> 16:44.552
dashing.

16:44.554 --> 16:46.754
Yes, "dashing" is a
prerequisite for flag bearers.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.556
CRAIG:
Squad, fall in.

16:48.558 --> 16:50.992
Dress right, dress!

16:50.994 --> 16:54.095
A-ten hut!

16:55.130 --> 16:56.330
Ready.

16:56.332 --> 16:57.732
Port, arms.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.134
DRILL LEADER:
<i>One, two, three.</i>

17:00.136 --> 17:02.203
ALL: One.
One, two, three.

17:02.205 --> 17:03.904
Two.

17:03.906 --> 17:07.375
5:00 a.m. wake-up call,
man, that's bad enough.

17:07.377 --> 17:09.844
But the food? Come on.
Do you know how much

17:09.846 --> 17:12.079
our parents are paying
for this place?

17:12.080 --> 17:14.448
Took me a month to get
kicked out of my last school.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.084
Think I'm going
for a personal best.

17:17.086 --> 17:18.752
DRILL LEADER: One, two, three.
Hey,

17:18.755 --> 17:20.721
you doing okay, Piggy?

17:20.723 --> 17:22.490
DRILL LEADER:
One, two, three.

17:22.492 --> 17:23.656
Man, you're all flushed.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.659
Stop!
Just breathe.

17:25.661 --> 17:27.161
Come on, man.

17:27.163 --> 17:29.230
Cadet Piggy, what the hell
are you doing?

17:29.232 --> 17:31.465
He needs a break,
Golan, come on.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.700
That's Drill Leader.

17:32.702 --> 17:35.102
What?

17:35.104 --> 17:36.971
You will address me
as drill leader, Cadet DiNozzo.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.406
Okay, well,
Drill Leader,

17:38.408 --> 17:39.907
I think Piggy
needs a little break.

17:39.909 --> 17:41.475
And probably the nurse.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.277
GOLAN:
That's two demerits, DiNozzo.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.713
What for?
One for dropping out of PT.

17:45.715 --> 17:47.148
One for your tone.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.649
Yeah, whatever--
let's get Piggy to the nurse.

17:48.651 --> 17:49.984
Piggy is gonna stay
where he is until

17:49.986 --> 17:51.352
he learns how to
keep up with the rest

17:51.354 --> 17:52.753
of the squad,
and you are gonna

17:52.755 --> 17:54.055
get back in line if you

17:54.057 --> 17:55.356
know what's good for you.

17:56.525 --> 17:58.292
Well, one thing's for sure--

17:58.294 --> 18:00.694
I've never known
what's good for me.

18:00.696 --> 18:03.464
CRAIG:
Company, halt!

18:03.466 --> 18:04.832
<i>I called Wallis after</i>

18:04.834 --> 18:06.700
Christine died.

18:06.702 --> 18:08.069
I thought he should know.

18:08.071 --> 18:09.537
Why would he need to know?

18:10.972 --> 18:12.940
We're investigating
Wallis's murder,

18:12.942 --> 18:15.409
not an infraction
of the school's code of conduct.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.746
They were dating,
weren't they?

18:21.683 --> 18:24.351
It started last year,
after the fall formal,

18:24.353 --> 18:26.887
and they stayed together even
after Wallis graduated.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.957
Must have been hard on Christine
when Wallis enlisted.

18:29.959 --> 18:32.960
I can't say.
She kept it to herself.

18:32.962 --> 18:34.361
You were close
with Wallis?

18:34.363 --> 18:36.464
He was my commanding
officer for two years.

18:36.466 --> 18:37.865
Yeah, we were tight.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.734
Wallis come back to campus?
No, ma'am.

18:40.736 --> 18:42.269
He was pretty broken up
over Christine.

18:42.271 --> 18:43.571
Said he was gonna

18:43.573 --> 18:44.705
drown away his sorrows,

18:44.707 --> 18:46.073
crawl into a hole.

18:47.476 --> 18:48.709
I'm sorry, that's all I know.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.544
Well...

18:50.546 --> 18:52.580
call us if you
think of anything else.

18:52.582 --> 18:55.449
Special Agent DiNozzo.

18:55.451 --> 18:58.119
It's graduates like you
that make this school proud.

18:59.154 --> 19:01.088
Uh, I think he
wants you to salute

19:01.090 --> 19:02.523
him back.
I know.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.693
Thank you.
Ma'am.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.662
Maybe he's right.

19:08.664 --> 19:09.830
Wallis went off
to self-medicate,

19:09.832 --> 19:11.499
got caught
in a bad situation.

19:11.501 --> 19:13.033
What do you think?

19:13.035 --> 19:14.768
I think the guy
over at that pickup

19:14.770 --> 19:17.872
has been watching us
since we got out here.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.108
What guy?

19:21.110 --> 19:24.845
There was a guy.

19:24.847 --> 19:27.448
Didn't even know
the phone was here

19:27.450 --> 19:30.317
until I heard it come to
life a few hours ago.

19:30.319 --> 19:31.585
Scared me to death.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.888
Wallis came to see you?
Yeah.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.489
Didn't know he was UA.

19:37.292 --> 19:38.792
Sorry about the mess.

19:38.794 --> 19:41.128
Been having a hell of a time
with this new table saw.

19:41.130 --> 19:43.664
For $1,500,
you think she'd work.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.867
Why'd Wallis come to see you?

19:46.869 --> 19:49.670
I was his mentor.

19:49.672 --> 19:51.472
You went to RMA?

19:51.474 --> 19:53.140
School saved my life.

19:53.142 --> 19:54.808
Turned me from a punk
into a man.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.477
Enlisted in the Corps,
went into business.

19:56.479 --> 19:57.978
All thanks to RMA.

19:57.980 --> 19:59.813
So I give back.

19:59.815 --> 20:01.148
Started a scholarship.

20:01.150 --> 20:03.050
The Cantor Scholars.

20:03.052 --> 20:05.486
I pick a different
kid every year.

20:05.488 --> 20:06.921
Pay their way
through RMA.

20:06.923 --> 20:08.622
Help 'em out.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.424
And Wallis was
one of these kids?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.293
Got him out of the worst
school in Richmond.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.161
From the day I met him,
I knew he'd do me proud.

20:14.163 --> 20:15.896
What about the night
he came here?

20:15.898 --> 20:17.298
He was a mess.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.934
His girlfriend had
committed suicide.

20:19.936 --> 20:21.502
He didn't know what to do.

20:21.504 --> 20:23.737
I tried to guide him.

20:23.739 --> 20:25.873
Wallis was UA for five days

20:25.875 --> 20:27.841
before he died.

20:27.843 --> 20:29.376
Any idea
where he might go?

20:29.378 --> 20:30.778
Not his family.

20:30.780 --> 20:33.013
They bugged out of town
his sophomore year.

20:33.015 --> 20:35.049
No forwarding address.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.718
He came from a
tough neighborhood.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.286
A lot of gang violence.

20:39.288 --> 20:41.689
He fought his whole life
to get away.

20:41.691 --> 20:43.691
Maybe he didn't have
any fight left in him.

20:43.693 --> 20:46.193
TONY: <i>Okay, let's get something</i>
<i>straight: you will not,</i>

20:46.195 --> 20:48.095
under any circumstances,
tell McGee

20:48.097 --> 20:50.397
one detail of what you saw
at my old school.

20:51.633 --> 20:54.468
The only thing I saw was
that you were a good cadet,

20:54.470 --> 20:56.003
and that they respect you.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.572
Yeah... so let's not
go blabbing about it.

20:58.574 --> 21:00.040
Why does it bother you?

21:02.711 --> 21:04.378
It's part of who you are.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.579
You can't ignore
your past, Tony.

21:05.581 --> 21:08.015
Just watch me.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.184
And not one word
or I'll tell McGee

21:10.186 --> 21:11.986
that song you sing
in the shower.

21:11.988 --> 21:13.988
How did...?
Cheap motel. Thin walls.

21:13.990 --> 21:15.456
It's a ridiculous song.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.628
Step on it or we're gonna be
late for this dinner of yours.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.598
(phone ringing)

21:24.600 --> 21:27.501
Oh, you and Gibbs.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.903
Very Special Agent DiNozzo.

21:29.905 --> 21:32.973
MAN: You don't know the whole story
about Christine and Wallis.

21:32.975 --> 21:34.541
Who is this?

21:34.543 --> 21:35.776
Someone who can help.

21:35.778 --> 21:38.045
Okay. I'm listening.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.214
What don't I know
about Christine and Wallis?

21:40.216 --> 21:42.316
Not on the phone.
We meet in person.

21:42.318 --> 21:44.184
Parking lot.
Nutley Hardware.

21:44.186 --> 21:45.753
Oh, Nutley.

21:45.755 --> 21:48.255
That's right next to Remington
Academy. Um...

21:48.257 --> 21:50.691
we just got back to DC.

21:50.693 --> 21:53.961
You better turn around if you
want to know why Wallis died.

21:54.996 --> 21:56.830
All right, we'll be there
in six hours.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.132
We'll bring breakfast.

21:58.134 --> 22:00.701
Hope you like
gas station taquitos.

22:00.703 --> 22:03.637
All right. Leaves one issue.

22:03.639 --> 22:06.507
JAKE: <i>No, I understand,</i>
<i>you have to go back.</i>

22:06.509 --> 22:08.108
It's for the case.

22:08.110 --> 22:10.110
BISHOP: Well, the good news is,
you can go home.

22:10.112 --> 22:11.912
And don't worry about Gibbs.
Tony's gonna let him know.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.447
Oh, I think he
already does.

22:13.449 --> 22:15.115
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.

22:15.117 --> 22:16.517
You do what you got to do.

22:16.519 --> 22:18.018
BISHOP:
I'm so sorry.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.854
Okay. I'm gonna go now.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.793
I guess it's just
the two of us.

22:27.762 --> 22:30.331
Should we eat?

22:31.700 --> 22:34.168
Jake, I want to ask you
something...

22:34.170 --> 22:35.769
work-related.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.405
Will it require top-secret
clearance to answer?

22:38.407 --> 22:40.708
(laughing)
Yeah.

22:40.710 --> 22:43.444
And it stays between us.
I'm all ears.

22:46.281 --> 22:50.017
What do you know about Russian
and Palestinian relations?

22:50.019 --> 22:53.053
Ah.

22:57.559 --> 22:59.326
You think our Deep Throat's
a no-show?

22:59.328 --> 23:00.527
Hmm?

23:01.629 --> 23:03.230
TONY:
What?

23:03.232 --> 23:05.666
Who's this?

23:05.668 --> 23:07.735
Here we go.

23:11.573 --> 23:13.006
Get in. They could
be watching us.

23:13.008 --> 23:14.541
"They" would be...?

23:15.643 --> 23:17.711
Piggy? Is that you?

23:17.713 --> 23:20.781
Nobody calls me that
anymore, Tony.

23:20.783 --> 23:23.350
Now get in the truck.
It's not safe.

23:37.521 --> 23:39.855
What is this place?

23:39.857 --> 23:42.224
Some kind of
condemned property?

23:42.226 --> 23:43.392
It's my house.

23:43.394 --> 23:45.794
Oh. Sorry. It's, uh...

23:45.796 --> 23:48.163
It's very distinct.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.498
Hey, turn that off!

23:49.500 --> 23:52.000
(sighs) No. What are you
afraid of, Travis?

23:52.002 --> 23:53.301
RMA, Tony.

23:53.303 --> 23:54.770
They're everywhere.

23:54.772 --> 23:56.705
Why are you afraid of RMA?

23:58.074 --> 24:00.442
Because I work for them.

24:00.444 --> 24:03.278
Okay... you said
you knew what happened

24:03.280 --> 24:05.680
with Wallis and Christine.

24:05.682 --> 24:07.983
Christine's death
is not what you think.

24:07.985 --> 24:09.217
She didn't commit suicide?

24:09.219 --> 24:11.253
She was pushed to it.

24:12.588 --> 24:14.156
It was Honor Corps.

24:20.530 --> 24:22.664
Hello?

24:22.666 --> 24:24.599
What the hell?

24:36.746 --> 24:39.247
What's up, guys?
GOLAN: Cadet DiNozzo.

24:39.249 --> 24:40.549
You've been found guilty
of breaking rules

24:40.551 --> 24:42.050
of the code of conduct.

24:42.052 --> 24:44.419
Your punishment will be
delivered by Honor Corps.

24:44.421 --> 24:45.754
I'm guessing
you're the Honor Corps.

24:45.756 --> 24:47.389
You're ours for
the night, DiNozzo,

24:47.391 --> 24:48.690
and we're gonna have fun.

24:48.692 --> 24:50.258
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead
and opt out.

24:50.260 --> 24:52.227
Mm... no.

24:58.201 --> 25:01.002
All right, you really want
to do this?

25:01.004 --> 25:03.972
Huh?

25:03.974 --> 25:06.007
TANNER: DiNozzo, where
the hell have you been?

25:06.009 --> 25:08.110
Basketball practice
started ten minutes ago

25:08.112 --> 25:09.744
down in the weight room--
you're late.

25:12.115 --> 25:14.983
Need to make do without him.

25:27.063 --> 25:29.831
Thanks, Coach Tanner.
Don't thank me yet.

25:29.833 --> 25:31.833
I've seen you shoot.
You got talent.

25:31.835 --> 25:34.202
I meant it-- you're officially
on the basketball team,

25:34.204 --> 25:36.972
and officially
ten minutes late.

25:36.974 --> 25:38.673
20 laps, DiNozzo.

25:42.078 --> 25:43.845
I thought
Coach Tanner put an end

25:43.847 --> 25:45.480
to Honor Corps our senior year.

25:45.482 --> 25:47.249
Nothing ended senior year.

25:47.251 --> 25:49.117
They just kept
it quieter.

25:49.119 --> 25:51.453
And basketball players
were off-limits.

25:51.455 --> 25:54.623
You have no idea what
was happening to me

25:54.625 --> 25:56.491
when Honor Corps came around.

25:56.493 --> 25:57.859
What's Honor Corps?

25:59.162 --> 26:00.428
It's a group of students

26:00.430 --> 26:02.898
who bully substandard cadets.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.967
Break a rule, or bring
squad performance down,

26:05.969 --> 26:07.602
and they pay you a visit.
Look...

26:07.604 --> 26:09.070
Travis...

26:09.072 --> 26:11.239
I'm sorry for what happened
to you, but...

26:11.241 --> 26:12.841
I'm wondering
what happened to Christine.

26:12.843 --> 26:14.142
They disciplined her.

26:14.144 --> 26:16.545
Every night for a month
before she died.

26:17.713 --> 26:18.980
They broke her.

26:20.716 --> 26:22.784
So, how does Wallis play
into all this?

26:22.786 --> 26:25.086
I told him exactly
what I told you.

26:25.088 --> 26:26.555
Wallis was here?

26:26.557 --> 26:28.490
He came a few days
after Christine died.

26:28.492 --> 26:29.958
He was looking for answers.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.194
I brought him here, and
I told him everything.

26:32.196 --> 26:34.763
Then he went back to campus
to confront Honor Corps.

26:34.765 --> 26:35.997
Who did he confront?

26:35.999 --> 26:38.333
I don't know their names
or faces,

26:38.335 --> 26:41.670
but Wallis sure seemed to know
whose ass he was going to kick.

26:41.672 --> 26:44.406
Listen, Travis...

26:44.408 --> 26:46.408
I am sorry.

26:46.410 --> 26:49.511
I had no idea what was
happening to you back then.

26:51.647 --> 26:54.049
'Cause you never asked.

26:58.321 --> 27:00.222
Well, I spent the morning
trying to find out

27:00.224 --> 27:01.756
if Wallis's death was
gang-related,

27:01.758 --> 27:03.425
like Frederick Cantor suggested.

27:03.427 --> 27:06.228
Turns out
he was a straight-A student,

27:06.230 --> 27:08.330
never got into any trouble.

27:08.332 --> 27:10.198
Now, on the plus side,

27:10.200 --> 27:14.169
Abby managed to get surveillance
from the bus station near RMA,

27:14.171 --> 27:15.737
was able to prove

27:15.739 --> 27:18.139
that Wallis was
at the school a few days ago.

27:18.141 --> 27:20.008
That's great, McGee. Hey...

27:20.010 --> 27:22.177
I need to know what happened
at dinner last night.

27:22.179 --> 27:23.678
Oh, uh...

27:23.680 --> 27:26.281
Well, last I saw, Gibbs and Jake
were at the table.

27:26.283 --> 27:27.616
I didn't stick around.

27:27.618 --> 27:29.384
Why did you leave them alone?

27:29.386 --> 27:31.286
It was every man for himself.

27:31.288 --> 27:32.854
Why? What did Jake say?

27:32.856 --> 27:34.589
Well, I haven't heard from him.

27:34.591 --> 27:37.859
All right, I'm calling Jake
again right now.

27:37.861 --> 27:40.428
Okay.

27:42.231 --> 27:45.166
(wolf-whistling)

27:47.837 --> 27:49.537
(wolf-whistling continues)

27:56.646 --> 27:58.413
Hello?
BISHOP: McGee?

27:58.415 --> 28:00.181
I was trying
to call Jake's phone.

28:00.183 --> 28:02.250
You <i>did</i> call Jake's phone.
It was on Gibbs' desk.

28:02.252 --> 28:04.653
Why is my husband's phone
on Gibbs' desk?

28:04.655 --> 28:06.321
Hey, why does he call you
"Ellie Belly"?

28:06.323 --> 28:07.956
Tim, this is serious.

28:10.092 --> 28:11.559
Tim?

28:11.561 --> 28:13.194
You know what?
I'm gonna call you back.

28:13.196 --> 28:14.562
No, wait. Tim...?

28:17.233 --> 28:19.668
Hey, boss.

28:19.670 --> 28:21.569
What's up?

28:21.571 --> 28:23.204
I was in Silver Springs
this morning--

28:23.206 --> 28:24.839
where Christine
Sanders is from?

28:24.841 --> 28:27.275
She filed a police report
over winter break.

28:30.112 --> 28:31.446
She was being stalked?

28:31.448 --> 28:33.415
Someone followed
her at the mall.

28:33.417 --> 28:37.519
And then, he was in
her house at night.

28:37.521 --> 28:40.155
Someone she knew.

28:43.092 --> 28:44.793
I'm not a stalker.
TONY: How do you explain

28:44.795 --> 28:46.294
following Christine home
for winter break?

28:46.296 --> 28:47.996
We were friends.

28:47.998 --> 28:49.698
BISHOP: Friends don't
sneak into each other's

28:49.700 --> 28:51.199
bedrooms to surprise them.

28:51.201 --> 28:52.834
I'm Senior Cadet,
captain of the football team,

28:52.836 --> 28:54.169
and I haven't got there

28:54.171 --> 28:56.905
by taking no for an answer.
You have no clue

28:56.907 --> 28:58.340
how bad that sounds, do you?

28:58.342 --> 29:00.075
I got the message
when the police cuffed me,

29:00.077 --> 29:01.409
and they threw me
in a holding cell.

29:01.411 --> 29:03.378
I left her alone
after that.

29:03.380 --> 29:04.979
No, you didn't.

29:04.981 --> 29:06.481
You wanted
to punish Christine.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.683
No... no, I didn't touch her.

29:08.685 --> 29:10.118
BISHOP:
Right.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.088
Honor Corps did.
Ah... (scoffs)

29:13.090 --> 29:16.291
Honor Corps is a folk tale
that we tell plebes

29:16.293 --> 29:18.326
to scare them--
Hey... hey!

29:18.328 --> 29:19.494
You can't go in there.

29:20.463 --> 29:23.064
I went to this school,
Cadet Craig.

29:23.066 --> 29:25.233
I know what a gray
armband means.

29:26.202 --> 29:27.602
You used Honor Corps

29:27.604 --> 29:29.237
to punish Christine
for turning you down.

29:29.239 --> 29:31.272
It's not like that.

29:31.274 --> 29:34.075
TONY: It's not like that?
What's it like?

29:34.077 --> 29:35.310
You'd drag her out at night,

29:35.312 --> 29:37.379
force her to do PT,
humiliate herself.

29:37.381 --> 29:39.214
We have a code of conduct.

29:40.316 --> 29:42.650
You break the code,
you pay the price.

29:43.619 --> 29:46.287
Christine broke the code.
Translation being:

29:46.289 --> 29:48.256
you made up a reason
to get her in trouble.

29:48.258 --> 29:49.691
I remember guys like you.

29:49.693 --> 29:52.394
Drank the Kool-Aid,
believed in the traditions,

29:52.396 --> 29:54.863
because you were desperate
to be a part of something.

29:54.865 --> 29:57.298
Well, guess what?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.667
You're part of something.

29:59.669 --> 30:02.537
But outside
of these walls, Cadet,

30:02.539 --> 30:06.074
nobody gives a damn
about your code.

30:07.476 --> 30:08.543
BISHOP:
Whatever you did

30:08.545 --> 30:11.212
led Christine to kill herself.

30:12.481 --> 30:15.483
You can't prove that.
We don't have to.

30:15.485 --> 30:17.919
We're not here to arrest you
for Christine's suicide.

30:17.921 --> 30:19.788
Wallis's murder,
on the other hand...

30:19.790 --> 30:21.689
I, uh...
BISHOP: We know he came to campus,

30:21.691 --> 30:24.225
found out about Honor Corps,
and he came looking for you.

30:24.227 --> 30:26.628
TONY:
You are the senior cadet,

30:26.630 --> 30:28.596
captain of the football team,

30:28.598 --> 30:33.234
with a bright future
ahead of you.

30:33.236 --> 30:36.304
Unless it disappears.

30:36.306 --> 30:38.440
Tell us what happened.

30:40.976 --> 30:43.378
BISHOP:
Wallis came to see you.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.947
He was furious.

30:46.949 --> 30:49.551
He had every right to be. I...

30:51.554 --> 30:55.457
I pushed Christine too far,
and, uh...

30:57.092 --> 30:58.693
...I made her kill herself.

31:01.297 --> 31:03.798
And he wanted to make me pay.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.266
You fought him?

31:05.268 --> 31:06.768
No.

31:08.304 --> 31:10.305
Provost Tanner stopped him.

31:12.007 --> 31:13.575
ABBY:
<i>I finally got a hit</i>

31:13.577 --> 31:15.677
on the tire tracks
from your crime scene.

31:15.679 --> 31:18.646
And it wasn't easy, either.
I compared them to every tire

31:18.648 --> 31:20.448
that's actively sold
on the market.

31:20.450 --> 31:22.250
No match.
Then I compared them

31:22.252 --> 31:24.185
to international tires.

31:24.187 --> 31:27.088
Nothing, so I had to
think out of the box.

31:27.090 --> 31:29.123
Discontinued tires.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.659
And that's when I hit pay dirt.

31:31.661 --> 31:34.095
The track is from a tread used

31:34.097 --> 31:37.699
exclusively in the 1970s
on various European cars.

31:37.701 --> 31:39.968
McGEE: Could a tire
manufactured in the '70s

31:39.970 --> 31:41.236
still be operational today?

31:41.238 --> 31:43.838
No, but a replica could.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.106
This is a custom job

31:45.108 --> 31:47.942
made to resemble
the original tire of...

31:47.944 --> 31:51.312
a 1972 Citroen DS.

31:51.314 --> 31:53.314
TANNER:
<i>DiNozzo!</i>

31:53.316 --> 31:56.150
I just got a very angry call
from Cadet Craig's father.

31:56.152 --> 31:57.285
You can't be
interrogating

31:57.287 --> 31:58.920
one of my students
without letting me know.

31:58.922 --> 32:00.989
And why are you looking
at my car?

32:02.992 --> 32:05.193
Coach, will you open
the trunk, please?

32:05.195 --> 32:09.097
Or I'll get a warrant
and break it open.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.267
Thank you.

32:14.537 --> 32:16.638
Please step to the side.

32:33.055 --> 32:34.055
(sighs)

32:35.891 --> 32:37.892
There was a lot of
blood back here.

32:37.894 --> 32:39.594
TONY:
Gerald Tanner,

32:39.596 --> 32:42.697
you are under arrest
for the murder of John Wallis.

33:02.779 --> 33:04.413
(engine starter clicking,
grinding)

33:04.415 --> 33:06.916
Come on. Come on.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.019
(engine starter clicking,
grinding repeatedly)

33:12.155 --> 33:13.155
Damn!

33:13.157 --> 33:16.692
(sighs)

33:21.598 --> 33:23.199
What's the plan here?

33:23.201 --> 33:25.701
Steal the coach's car,
drive to Mexico?

33:25.703 --> 33:27.269
Hey, maybe.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.171
I don't belong here.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.208
I'm not a
rules-and-regulations guy.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.877
So your dad sends you
to school number seven.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.046
It don't feel right.
You cut and run.

33:37.048 --> 33:38.848
But for how long?

33:39.683 --> 33:42.318
You have
an opportunity here.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.220
You have talent
on the basketball court.

33:44.222 --> 33:45.688
You're smart.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.223
You don't like rules
and regulations?

33:47.225 --> 33:48.824
Me, neither.

33:48.826 --> 33:50.459
You gonna let that
stop you?

33:52.763 --> 33:54.363
It's self-preservation.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.966
You're worried about Cadet Golan?
He hates me.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.734
And he runs Honor Corps.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.436
It's only a matter of time.

34:00.438 --> 34:01.871
Honor Corps won't touch you.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.606
How do you know that?

34:03.608 --> 34:07.309
Because you're a starter
on the varsity basketball team, DiNozzo...

34:07.311 --> 34:09.478
and I look out for my guys.

34:11.313 --> 34:13.748
Now, there are things
about this school

34:13.751 --> 34:15.384
that are gonna change.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.254
Honor Corps is one of them.
This is a good place.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.456
You do belong.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.924
Don't run.

34:21.926 --> 34:24.527
Take a stand.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.295
And I'll stand with you.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.342
He was a mentor.

34:43.079 --> 34:44.914
Want me to take
the interview?

34:44.916 --> 34:48.918
No. I'm not gonna run.

34:50.587 --> 34:52.353
(door opens)

35:01.198 --> 35:02.832
You had a nice long car ride
to think

35:02.834 --> 35:03.933
about what you're gonna say,

35:03.935 --> 35:05.167
so don't make
any excuses.

35:05.169 --> 35:06.635
I want an explanation.

35:06.637 --> 35:09.605
You lied to me about seeing
Wallis on campus that night.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.574
I didn't tell you about Wallis because...
Because his blood

35:11.576 --> 35:13.642
was all over the trunk
of your car?

35:13.644 --> 35:14.944
I don't know how that got there.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.279
Why would I kill Wallis?

35:17.281 --> 35:18.848
Honor Corps.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.883
You said you were gonna get
rid of that 20 years ago.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.017
Wanted to.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.385
It's not that easy.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.488
You know how RMA is
with tradition.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.789
Honor Corps is not
a tradition.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.924
It is as ingrained
in our DNA

35:28.926 --> 35:32.194
as Color Guard or Plebe Week.
You're the provost.

35:32.196 --> 35:35.664
I didn't get to be provost
by effecting change, Tony.

35:43.540 --> 35:47.610
What happened the night
Wallis confronted you?

35:47.612 --> 35:50.946
I stopped him
from pummeling Craig.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.815
Took him
to my office.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.618
He blamed Honor Corps
for Christine's death.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.086
Wanted to shine a light.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.122
I told him that if he exposed
Honor Corps that...

36:00.124 --> 36:02.525
it would hurt the school.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.126
At least you had your
priorities straight.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.629
I told Wallis that he needed
to take a step back, that...

36:06.631 --> 36:08.364
we could work it out.

36:08.366 --> 36:09.965
But he could tell
you were lying.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.934
You know how many kids

36:11.936 --> 36:14.069
this school has saved,
over the years?

36:14.071 --> 36:15.604
Just like you?

36:15.606 --> 36:20.476
Doesn't that success outweigh
a few lost causes?

36:20.478 --> 36:22.811
Christine wasn't a lost cause--

36:22.813 --> 36:26.482
none of 'em were-- they were
just kids who needed help.

36:26.484 --> 36:30.452
Just like me.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.354
When did you pull the knife?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.355
You're not listening, DiNozzo.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.057
I didn't touch him.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.459
He walked out of my office,
prepared to expose us.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.228
I braced myself
for the fallout.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.096
How did his blood get
in your car?

36:41.098 --> 36:43.299
I don't know.
I-I barely drive the car.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.801
Spends most of the time in the shop.
And when it's not in the shop?

36:45.803 --> 36:47.269
It is where it always is.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.805
And everybody knows
where I keep the spare key.

36:50.974 --> 36:53.642
If you change your mind
and decide to leave...

36:57.681 --> 37:01.150
...don't hot-wire my car.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.785
Whatever you think of me,

37:02.787 --> 37:05.321
I never could have done this.

37:06.156 --> 37:08.958
I left RMA a long time ago.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.492
I don't talk about it.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.461
It's not who I am.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.763
But there was a part of me
that still believed.

37:14.765 --> 37:17.733
In the motto. The code.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.837
And that part's gone now...

37:21.839 --> 37:24.306
along with Christine Sanders...

37:24.308 --> 37:26.709
and John Wallis.

37:28.979 --> 37:31.647
(door opens, closes)

37:33.650 --> 37:34.650
Tony was right.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.052
The spare key
was in the sun visor.

37:37.054 --> 37:39.922
And Wallis's prints are all over
the steering wheel

37:39.924 --> 37:42.358
and the gear shift.
McGEE: Wallis took Tanner's car,

37:42.360 --> 37:44.860
and Wallis's killer
brought the car back to RMA.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.562
Any other fingerprints?

37:46.564 --> 37:49.298
No. There were
no more fingerprints or DNA.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.801
But I did find traces
of paraffin wax.

37:52.803 --> 37:54.837
Was Tanner a carpenter?

37:57.474 --> 38:00.809
We have access to the bus
station security cameras?

38:00.811 --> 38:01.910
Yes.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.512
I want to see the 24-hour period

38:03.514 --> 38:05.881
after Wallis was killed.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.852
After Wallis was killed?

38:09.854 --> 38:12.888
Whoever returned Tanner's car
needed a way to get home.

38:29.739 --> 38:31.507
Special Agent Gibbs.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.108
Didn't hear you knock.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.643
I didn't.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.346
Still having trouble
with this damn saw.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.081
Just won't work right.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.427
Something got in here
that wasn't supposed to.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.818
I'm guessing

38:41.819 --> 38:42.851
it's John Wallis's blood.

38:42.853 --> 38:45.220
He came down here again,
to see you.

38:45.222 --> 38:46.855
We have
surveillance footage

38:46.857 --> 38:49.491
of you from the bus station
near RMA.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.226
Stop.

38:53.463 --> 38:55.497
I'm not gonna
cause you any problems.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.334
I knew you'd come back
to me eventually.

39:00.270 --> 39:01.904
You'll find Wallis's blood
on the chisel.

39:01.906 --> 39:04.807
I tried to clean up, but...
Yeah.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.342
Blood doesn't clean up
too easy, does it?

39:08.945 --> 39:11.180
What happened when
Wallis came back here?

39:11.182 --> 39:14.149
He was upset.
(wry laugh)

39:14.151 --> 39:19.321
He was talking wildly about
Honor Corps and cleaning up RMA.

39:19.323 --> 39:21.557
He wanted to go public.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.859
He didn't know
where to start.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.360
He needed your help.

39:25.362 --> 39:28.397
He didn't understand
the ramifications.

39:28.399 --> 39:31.567
A scandal like this
could hobble the school.

39:31.569 --> 39:35.604
I have no wife, no kids--
all I have is RMA.

39:35.606 --> 39:37.072
It's my legacy.

39:37.074 --> 39:39.241
I couldn't have let
Wallis threaten that.

39:39.243 --> 39:42.377
Even if your legacy is broken?

39:42.379 --> 39:45.547
Honor Corps seems harsh
to an outsider, but it works.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.516
Weeds out the weak.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.785
Challenges the rest
to live up to a standard.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.186
It made a man out of me.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.287
Did it?

39:52.289 --> 39:54.056
Man enough to know
what's important.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.291
To respect tradition.

39:56.293 --> 40:00.162
"Truth, Valor, Duty."

40:00.164 --> 40:02.331
That's our motto.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.433
I gave it to Wallis,
and he betrayed it.

40:04.435 --> 40:07.402
No, he lived up to the motto.

40:07.404 --> 40:10.272
You betrayed him.

40:15.011 --> 40:16.912
(elevator bell chimes,
doors slide open)

40:22.485 --> 40:24.186
They're letting me go.

40:25.121 --> 40:28.190
Uh, I just wanted to say
that I never m...

40:30.493 --> 40:31.693
I'm resigning.

40:31.695 --> 40:36.598
You were right-- I let the
kids down, I let you down.

40:39.269 --> 40:41.103
For what it's worth,

40:41.105 --> 40:43.005
I am proud of the man
you've become.

40:52.215 --> 40:54.883
(sighs deeply)

41:02.692 --> 41:04.893
(sighs)

41:04.895 --> 41:06.328
You okay?

41:06.330 --> 41:07.830
Never better.

41:08.832 --> 41:10.232
I have something for you.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.174
It's a photo of
a photo but...

41:19.176 --> 41:21.243
you should keep it.

41:22.879 --> 41:24.746
It's the past, Bishop.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.381
It's your past, Tony,

41:26.383 --> 41:27.883
and it's a good one.

41:29.752 --> 41:32.454
I have a tricky relationship
with the past.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.723
I either bury it...

41:34.725 --> 41:36.258
or fixate on it.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.526
Still working out the kinks.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.928
Well... whatever
happened in your past,

41:39.930 --> 41:42.564
helped make you the
awesome guy you are today.

41:44.801 --> 41:46.335
Well, if it isn't
Jake Molloy!

41:46.337 --> 41:47.870
Look at you!

41:47.872 --> 41:48.971
Hey.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.105
Hey.

41:50.107 --> 41:51.306
Where were you?
Yeah, I'm-I'm, I'm sorry.

41:51.308 --> 41:53.742
Closed-door meetings
at NSA all day long.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.110
I mean, I would've
called but, uh--

41:55.112 --> 41:56.345
But Gibbs had your phone?
Yeah.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.813
I left it in the diner
last night.

41:57.815 --> 41:59.748
He said he'd leave it here
and I could pick it up.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.116
BISHOP: Sorry I made you
sit through dinner.

42:01.118 --> 42:02.451
JAKE:
Oh, no, don't be.

42:02.453 --> 42:03.418
It was great.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.120
I mean, Gibbs is
so easy to talk to.

42:05.122 --> 42:06.321
He is?

42:06.323 --> 42:07.923
Yeah, yeah.

42:07.925 --> 42:09.758
And we had a lot to discuss.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.959
Like what?

42:12.262 --> 42:14.630
What happens in the diner
stays in the diner.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.398
(wry chuckle)
Are you kidding?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.499
The whole point
of the dinner

42:17.501 --> 42:18.800
was we would have
more to talk about.

42:18.802 --> 42:21.336
And we will,
just not about last night.

42:22.338 --> 42:23.639
TONY:
Well, it sounds like

42:23.641 --> 42:25.941
you guys have a lot to talk
about on the ride home,

42:25.943 --> 42:27.409
so good luck with that.

42:27.411 --> 42:29.311
Yes, we will.

42:29.313 --> 42:31.113
Next time, Tony.

42:32.815 --> 42:34.182
BISHOP:
Bye, Tony.

42:40.690 --> 42:42.157
(clears throat quietly)

42:54.871 --> 42:57.606
(tapping phone keypad)

42:57.608 --> 42:59.041
(phone line ringing)

42:59.043 --> 43:00.108
MAN:
Hello?

43:00.110 --> 43:01.643
Piggy. Hey.

43:01.645 --> 43:04.346
I mean, Travis. Sorry.

43:04.348 --> 43:05.881
It's Tony. DiNozzo.

43:05.883 --> 43:07.115
Oh, hey...
(speaking indistinctly)

43:07.117 --> 43:08.417
Yeah.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.252
(speaks indistinctly)
I was thinking, what do you say

43:10.254 --> 43:12.554
we grab a late dinner, catch up?

43:12.556 --> 43:14.089
I can meet you halfway.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.791
(Travis speaks indistinctly)
How about Passaic?

43:15.793 --> 43:18.160
Sure... (speaks indistinctly)
(Tony chuckles)

43:18.162 --> 43:19.194
Three hours.

43:19.196 --> 43:20.228
I'll see you there.

43:20.230 --> 43:22.264
(speaks indistinctly, laughs)
All right.
