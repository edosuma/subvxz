closely later and placed it on a shelf.</i>

idea at all of the power</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:10.893

07:10.972 --> 07:16.650
<i>And through his own carelessness, he
released me back into this world.</i>

07:16.728 --> 07:20.778

to achieve my ultimate goal,</i>

07:20.857 --> 07:23.451

dunk my whole GPA.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.506
Well, it will if you go
in with that attitude.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.083
Hey, come on, Son.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.406
You got to think like a winner.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.007
You got to feel like a winner.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.929
You know what? Get in there, stand
at the bottom of that rope,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.131
stare up and say...

14:00.256 --> 14:03.430
When I get to the top I just
hope nobody looks up my shorts.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.761
(LAUGHS)

14:04.886 --> 14:07.264
I was very good-looking
when I was younger.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.691
Things change, darling.
You'll learn.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.608
(JOHN SIGHS)

14:11.851 --> 14:14.104
Look, your brother, Colin,
is really good at that.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.281
So, go ask him
for some pointers.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.608
Colin?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.409
The only pointers he has are the
ones popping up on his forehead.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.828
(BOTH LAUGHING) Max!

14:22.362 --> 14:24.615
He's definitely from
my side of the family.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.667
(SIGHS) Okay, why don't you go ask
your brother for some pointers.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.456
(SIGHS) Okay, I will.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.082
Bye, Grandma.
Goodbye, sweetie.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.379
Bye, cuz.
SHELLY: Yeah.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.460
Happy Halloween.
Try to meet a nice ghoul.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.886
You could bring her home
to your mother. (LAUGHS)

14:40.380 --> 14:43.634
You know, you would be so
much better <i>as</i> a blonde.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.138
Have you ever
thought about that?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.146
(CAT MEOWING)

14:50.139 --> 14:51.265
What's up, booger boy?

14:51.349 --> 14:52.521
Wait.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.814
(MEOWING CONTINUES)

14:53.893 --> 14:55.019
Do you hear that?

14:55.103 --> 14:56.480
Hear what?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.654
That...

14:57.730 --> 14:59.482
That cat meowing.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.765
It sounds like it's coming
from right here in the house.

15:01.789 --> 15:05.247
Ha! You wish. Mom and Dad
would never let you get one.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.449
So, you don't hear anything?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.041
No.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.289
Just this...

15:10.368 --> 15:11.460
(FARTS LOUDLY)

15:11.536 --> 15:12.662
Hey! Get off!

15:12.745 --> 15:13.962
Ugh! I have to
wear this.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.086
Listen, here's the situation.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.463
Tomorrow is senior
photo day and I figure

15:18.543 --> 15:20.623
since all the girls in my
class will be in one place,

15:20.647 --> 15:22.759
this is the perfect opportunity

15:22.880 --> 15:25.008
for me to score
some points, you know.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.343
Put on a little show.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.767
Oh. So, you want
to do a magic act?

15:29.846 --> 15:31.598
No, not a whole act, you doofus.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.433
Just a trick, something big.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.527
Something that will impress Jessica
Rogers and her whole posse.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.842
And you're gonna show it to me.

15:37.854 --> 15:38.980
Right now.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.440
Right now?
Right now.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.029
Uh...

15:42.608 --> 15:44.451
You want me to show you a trick?

15:45.111 --> 15:48.160
Yeah, I don't know. I'm
kind of rusty right now.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.329
Maybe I better think about it.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.669
Well, you better think fast.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.621
'Cause I'm not leaving
until I see a good one.

15:57.415 --> 16:00.214
Ow! Ow!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.716
Well, you said you wanted
to see something good.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.921
Is this good enough?

16:04.005 --> 16:05.723
Yeah, this is...
This is great.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.924
How do you do this?

16:07.159 --> 16:09.360
Well, you just stand in front
of your shoes and chant...

16:09.385 --> 16:13.060

Got it. (GRUNTS)

16:16.476 --> 16:17.602
Works every time.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.021
Cool. Thanks, man.

16:21.022 --> 16:24.367
Oh, hey, hey. Um, I have that rope
climb test tomorrow. Any pointers?

16:25.026 --> 16:26.949
Yeah, urn...
Don't fall.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.331
Okay, come here.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.574
Good news.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.872
I found a solid clue
about your parents.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.875
I went on the town's historical
website and found this...

16:38.331 --> 16:41.426
NICKY: You know, I hate that they
put "ghost hunter" in quotes.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.136
He was a ghost hunter,
obviously,

16:44.253 --> 16:46.221
or none of this
would be happening.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.174
Okay, so...

16:49.008 --> 16:50.305
Three years ago,

16:50.384 --> 16:53.854
it says your dad was doing research
at the old county courthouse.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.810
Doesn't mention your mom.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.392
Well, that was just
two days before

16:57.475 --> 17:00.149
both Mom and Dad
disappeared for good.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.980
And then we...

17:02.063 --> 17:04.191
Ended up like this.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.659
You know, like, that
courthouse is the last place.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.611
Dad was before he disappeared.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.116
We need to search there.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.288
Tonight.
Tonight.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.165
Why tonight?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.492
Well, Halloween is coming

17:14.575 --> 17:17.419
and Phears will have the power to
free his ghost army on that night,

17:17.494 --> 17:18.838
if we don't stop him.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.040
We need to
go there. Now.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.088
I liked Halloween a lot better

17:23.166 --> 17:25.044
when I thought the ghosts
were make-believe.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.674
(SIGHS) Let's go.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.229
Maybe we should forget it. What?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.981
You're not scared, are you?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.156
Why wouldn't I be?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.672
'Cause you're not
a little tiny baby.

17:47.696 --> 17:48.696
What did you say?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.214
I'm gonna open
the little tiny window.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.107
This place is pretty cool.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.033
Cammy did this with her friends.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.156
She's so talented.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.575
Of course she is.

MAX: if I didn't have my
ring to protect me,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.316
I don't think I would
be able to do this.

freaks and weirdoes, Max.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.783

Very funny.

Of course.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.961
Start in the scariest place.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.333
Makes perfect sense.

Guys?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.424

Note to self, not a ghost.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.018
How did people get anything
done before computers?

19:41.097 --> 19:44.192
If I could just use a search function,
this would take two seconds.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.236
We're wasting time, we should
be looking somewhere else.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.064
Tara, it's okay. We're
doing the best we can.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.364
Don't beat yourself up.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.987
We'll find something.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.785
What if we don't?

19:55.486 --> 19:57.659
NICKY: Uh, Max?
A little help, please.

everything we need to know about Dad.

are you doing here?

20:32.690 --> 20:35.193
I wanted to check out
your haunted house.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.904
But you couldn't
wait till it was open?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.956

because I left my phone.

You know, it's pretty
weird that you're here.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.892

scared here alone at night.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.265

even know where to start.

I have to get some sleep.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.897
I have that stupid rope-climbing
test tomorrow in PE.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.570
If I flunk this, I'll have
after-school PE for a month!

21:54.104 --> 21:55.481
Wait, I have an idea.

21:55.564 --> 21:59.865
What if Nicky and I show up in gym class
tomorrow and help you up the rope?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.111
What?

22:01.487 --> 22:04.741
All you have to do is make it look like
you're climbing and we'll fly you up.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.952
I mean, it's the least
we could do for you.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.749

was a bad idea.

Maybe you wanna
come over tonight

and maybe do some extra
credit for science class?

are pretty good.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.792
But that's not how it works.

40:13.912 --> 40:18.383
So why, then, almost four centuries
after it was hypothesized,

40:18.458 --> 40:20.131
is Newton's law of
gravity disproven?

40:22.629 --> 40:23.755
Miss Cahill.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.647
Because Newton's theory
only applied to the

40:26.673 --> 40:29.203
gravitational force field
up to 97,000 feet.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.851
Past that point, when gravity
is incrementally disbursed,

40:33.097 --> 40:34.394
the old law doesn't stand up.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.941
Correct.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.236
And who can tell me why
that's important to NASA?

40:38.311 --> 40:39.483
Mr. Doyle.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.657
Because as gravity decreases,
inertia increases,

40:42.732 --> 40:45.986
affecting weight disbursement,
fuel efficiency and speed

40:46.069 --> 40:47.537

He's their star player.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.830
Freeley was freaking out.
And get this.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.334
Tomorrow, he's starting at
the game against Dylan High.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:07.505
So, he's got to get going.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute!

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.671
My son is a starter
in the city finals?

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:16.882
It gets even better. Coach Freeley
called him their secret weapon.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.936
When were you planning
on telling us this?

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.437
Well,

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.107
I was gonna surprise you.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.601
(LAUGHS)

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.563
Well, we're surprised.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.990
Wow, my son's a starter.
I told you you could do it.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.147
Didn't I say he could do it, honey?
Of course, dear.

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:39.087
But we should get going, I
mean, we don't wanna be late

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.433
and be kicked off
the team, right?

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.727
Oh, no. Right, right, right. No.

01:01:41.803 --> 01:01:43.763
No son of mine is ever gonna
be late for practice.

01:01:43.805 --> 01:01:44.805
Go, fight.
Go.

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.036
No, wait.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.122
What time is the game?

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.045
Two o'clock.
Two o'clock?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.376
COLIN: Yep.
Two o'clock.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.969
Two o'clock. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock.

01:01:53.993 --> 01:01:56.113
I'm gonna call Eddie, I'm
gonna cancel that golf game,

01:01:56.137 --> 01:01:57.572
and I am gonna be there.
(WHOOPING)

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.133
Yeah, you are.
I better call Joan.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.634
Yeah.
Go call Eddie.

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:01.885
(LAUGHING)

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:04.562
Look, Mom and Dad told me about
how I freaked out this morning.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.606
But you helped me,
calmed me down

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.566
and kept me from hurting myself.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:12.067
I don't even know what happened,
but you helped me, so,

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.151
(EXHALES)

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.153
thank you.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.651
I owe you one.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.723
Do you know what happened to me?

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.662
You were possessed
by a berserker ghoul.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.413
Right, I said I owe you one.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.436
That doesn't mean I have
to believe your stories

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.963
about ghosts and magic. You know
I don't believe that stuff.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.489
Well, maybe someday you will.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:33.667
Dude, just get out of here.
Go do your nerd stuff.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.006
COLIN: Dad, I need the phone.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:42.509
EMMA: Come on,
my grave, further ahead.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.931
Okay, now what do we do?

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.107
Okay, Emma must
return to her grave

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.605
and Max will say his chant
while holding the ring.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.359
That should break the spell
and you can be dead again.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.865
Okay, great, then all
I have to do is...

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:58.776
(GASPING)

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.030
My ring!

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.282
I don't have it.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:04.661
I took it off and stuck it in my
pocket after soccer practice.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.707
You mean you came
out here, on Halloween,

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:08.748
with no protection from Phears?

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.832
Don't worry. I'll run
back and get it right now.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.718
Did I just hear someone say

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.471
that they forgot to bring the
ring to our little party?

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:24.847
(TUTTING) How careless.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:29.139
Looks like you all fell
for my little plan.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.896
Even you, Emma. You look
lovely, by the way.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.483
You see, I knew you would be good
to get the ring off his finger

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.657
but how would I capture
all of them together?

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:42.702
Easy, you tell them
the story about your family.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.950
How you want so
badly to be reunited,

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.907
just like Tara
and Nicky want to be

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.118
with their parents, and presto!

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.828
You all end up back
at your graveside.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.915
You see, I didn't just
pick you by accident.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.880
I knew nothing of this
plan, little ones.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.427
I swear it.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.463
Don't worry, Emma.
We believe you.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.428
Phears just used you.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:07.060
Oh. Oh, yes. Did I use you?
I'm so sorry.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:12.565
Finally, the end of the
Roland brats and Max Doyle.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.609
This is gonna be fun.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.686
No, leave Max out of it.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.649
He didn't do anything to you and he
has nothing to do with our parents.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:21.950
On the contrary,

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.122
he's had plenty to do
with disrupting my plans.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:31.118
And now all of you
are going to pay for it.

MAN: Echo, take one.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.028
(ROARS)

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:38.781
(GROANS)

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.282
Oh, I tore the other side.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:53.004
TARA: Do we keep looking?

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:01.846
Right, Max!

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:06.726
I totally forgot my line, Max.

01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.599
Oh, right, Max.

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:11.777
Like, how did he get in the
dresser then? (SNEEZES)

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.364
Bye, Mauler. Too bad no one...
(GROANS)

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.162
(MUTTERING)

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:29.953
It's hard.

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:31.921
I wanna do it more.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.554
MAX: Oh!
Oh, hey!

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.270
Guys, it's just Charlie
from next door.

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:49.936
HARRIET: Well, keep it away from me,
because I'll be in hives for a week.

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:52.818
(HARRIET SNEEZING)

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.942
Come here, boy.
Come here, Charlie.

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.691
Come here, Charlie.

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.071
What are you doing here?

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.823
You're supposed to be next...

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.038
(HARRIET SNEEZES)

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.582
All right. Come here.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:10.119
Come here, Charlie.

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:13.834
WOMAN: Just pick him up.

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:15.666
Just pick him up.
Is he good?

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:16.921
Yeah, yeah, just pick him up.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:18.422
Come here, Charlie.

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:21.596
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be next door.

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.090
See, Dad.

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:24.693
I told you nerdy boy
had a cat up here.

01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:25.969
MAX: You're dead.

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:47.455
What? How do you
wanna disappear?

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.166
Oh, we're disappearing.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:50.493
Oh, sorry.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:51.792
How do you wanna do it?

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:52.994
Um... High five.

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.420
(LAUGHS)

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.923
I don't know. That's all we have.
What do you want?
