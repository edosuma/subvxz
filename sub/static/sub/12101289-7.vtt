00:01.044 --> 00:03.173
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.256 --> 00:05.135
I fucking found you.

00:06.764 --> 00:08.141
You can't make me leave
without Hannah.

00:08.225 --> 00:11.231
[Moira] Do you wanna help her?
Fight them from Canada.

00:11.314 --> 00:15.657
Luke, Emily,
everyone who loves you is there.

00:16.074 --> 00:17.034
You'll come back for Nichole.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.286
Come back
for your baby daughter.

00:18.370 --> 00:21.544
Please leave the premises
immediately!

00:21.627 --> 00:23.631
We're in a really bad situation.

00:23.714 --> 00:24.800
I think we should turn her in.

00:24.883 --> 00:26.804
This is supposed to be
a humanitarian mission.

00:26.887 --> 00:28.306
Humanitarian missions
are about people.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.392
Not one person.

00:29.475 --> 00:30.979
Gilead finds out we took her,

00:31.062 --> 00:32.941
no more missions, no more food,
no more medicine

00:33.024 --> 00:34.360
for any of these people.

00:34.443 --> 00:35.445
What happened to you?

00:35.780 --> 00:37.324
She got knocked
to the ground in...

00:37.408 --> 00:38.911
In all that chaos back there.

00:39.245 --> 00:40.330
She hit her head pretty hard.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.211
All right. Next.

00:43.295 --> 00:45.424
You don't think I've ever
had to leave anyone behind?

00:45.508 --> 00:47.929
Every mission,
I've had to make hard choices

00:48.013 --> 00:49.683
that I regret every single day!

00:49.766 --> 00:50.602
I'm sorry.

00:50.685 --> 00:52.522
Let's not make this last longer
than it has to.

00:52.605 --> 00:54.108
I need to separate
my interests from Fred.

00:54.191 --> 00:56.195
‐I am done with him.
‐We can talk about that later.

00:56.279 --> 00:57.448
No, we can talk about it
right now.

00:57.532 --> 01:01.039
You're pregnant, Serena.
Congratulations.

01:01.122 --> 01:04.295
If I don't go back now,
Hannah is gone forever!

01:04.880 --> 01:09.347
I'm her mother.
It is my job to protect her.

01:09.598 --> 01:10.933
And I failed.

01:11.017 --> 01:11.852
[Luke] Where, where is she?

01:11.935 --> 01:13.689
[June] How can I tell him
that everything

01:13.773 --> 01:16.277
that has happened to her
is because of me?

01:18.406 --> 01:20.243
I'm sorry I don't have her.

01:20.662 --> 01:22.540
[sobbing] I'm sorry
it's just me.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.668
‐I knew it would...
‐No, no, no, no.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.795
‐I'm sorry.
‐No, no, no, no.

01:25.170 --> 01:28.468
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:35.608 --> 01:37.612
[seagulls squawking]

01:46.379 --> 01:47.882
[exhales]

01:51.180 --> 01:52.433
[Mark] Ms. Osborn.

01:56.315 --> 01:58.027
Ms. Osborn,
it's an honor to meet you.

01:58.111 --> 02:00.407
I'm Mark Tuello,
and this is Rachel Tapping,

02:00.490 --> 02:02.035
and we're here
from the U. S. government

02:02.119 --> 02:04.081
to welcome you
onto Canadian soil.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.085
[Rachel] We're very glad
to see you.

02:06.712 --> 02:10.385
You're okay, you're here now,
and you're safe.

02:10.469 --> 02:11.555
[Mark] Ms. Osborn,

02:12.347 --> 02:13.809
if you were returned to Gilead,

02:13.893 --> 02:16.314
would you be subject
to a danger of torture,

02:16.397 --> 02:17.441
a risk to your life,

02:17.525 --> 02:20.197
or a risk of cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment?

02:24.413 --> 02:25.415
Yes.

02:26.417 --> 02:27.796
[Rachel] And would you
be persecuted

02:27.879 --> 02:29.508
based on being a woman?

02:34.141 --> 02:35.143
Yes.

02:35.728 --> 02:38.149
[Mark] We understand
you're here to seek safety

02:38.233 --> 02:40.655
and asylum as a citizen
of the United States.

02:41.907 --> 02:43.326
You got this.

02:48.671 --> 02:50.340
My name is June Osborn.

02:53.054 --> 02:55.141
I am a citizen
of the United States,

02:56.143 --> 02:57.479
and I seek asylum

02:59.483 --> 03:01.028
in the country of Canada.

03:02.406 --> 03:04.870
[Mark] Thank you.
This way, please.

03:22.614 --> 03:24.659
[soft song playing]

03:33.217 --> 03:35.848
[indistinct chatter]

03:42.319 --> 03:44.323
[Mark] This will be your home
for the next several days

03:44.406 --> 03:46.202
while we ensure your security,

03:46.285 --> 03:48.081
your health,
and your well‐being.

03:48.164 --> 03:50.753
[Rachel] This is the standard
for all high‐profile refugees.

03:58.393 --> 04:00.773
[indistinct chatter]

04:15.761 --> 04:17.598
[elevator dings]

04:30.123 --> 04:31.083
[Rachel] Please let us know

04:31.167 --> 04:32.587
if there's anything else
you'd like.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.883
We've also procured
some clothing for you,

04:34.966 --> 04:37.179
we sent an assistant
to Anthropologie.

04:37.262 --> 04:38.807
[Luke] You said there would
be a doctor.

04:38.891 --> 04:41.312
[Rachel] A female doctor.
And a female therapist.

04:41.395 --> 04:43.357
[Mark] Thankfully your wife
was cleared of traumatic injury

04:43.441 --> 04:45.696
on the boat, but yes,
we will bring in a doctor

04:45.780 --> 04:48.744
and a mental health counselor
to assist with this transition.

04:49.829 --> 04:51.750
[Rachel] We tried to get
all your favorite foods,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.088
but there's a debit card
you can use.

04:54.171 --> 04:56.718
[Mark] Ms. Osborn,
your importance as a witness,

04:56.802 --> 04:59.724
what you achieved
in Gilead with Angels' Flight,

04:59.808 --> 05:02.897
what you have seen in D. C.
and Chicago

05:02.980 --> 05:06.320
that all makes you
inordinately valuable to us.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.617
[Rachel]
We'll leave you to rest.

05:09.118 --> 05:10.579
Order room service,

05:10.663 --> 05:13.292
have a nice meal
with your husband, take a bath.

05:14.336 --> 05:16.508
[Mark] And I'll see you tomorrow
to ask you some questions

05:16.591 --> 05:18.554
and begin your debrief.

05:18.637 --> 05:19.722
See you soon.

05:20.808 --> 05:22.144
‐Bye.
‐Bye.

05:26.402 --> 05:29.909
This place is a whole lot nicer
than the refugee center.

05:30.201 --> 05:31.538
[Luke] Are you all right?

05:34.502 --> 05:35.671
I'm gonna go.

05:36.673 --> 05:39.596
I'm gonna come back tomorrow
with Nichole.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.475
And I'll tell her
that you love her.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.830
[Luke] Thank you for everything.

05:52.914 --> 05:54.333
[Moira] Yeah, don't mention it.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.212
Make sure you grab
some of those,

05:56.295 --> 05:59.092
um, really nice moisturizers
from the hotel

05:59.176 --> 06:00.888
and bring 'em home, okay?
I love you.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.777
[door opens, closes]

06:10.741 --> 06:12.954
So, what do you wanna do?

06:13.037 --> 06:15.166
You wanna eat some food,
have something to drink?

06:15.250 --> 06:17.170
They've got some
really fancy water there.

06:17.254 --> 06:19.759
You probably just
wanna rest, actually.

06:19.842 --> 06:22.640
You wanna use the bathroom or...

06:23.224 --> 06:26.523
Bathroom? All right.
Uh, it's over there.

06:26.606 --> 06:27.440
Just through there.

06:27.525 --> 06:29.904
Um, I'll order some
room service,

06:29.988 --> 06:31.658
like the lady said,

06:33.077 --> 06:33.996
and we can just...

08:21.335 --> 08:22.378
[door opens]

08:24.717 --> 08:26.220
[dishes clattering]

08:37.534 --> 08:38.369
[mumbles]

10:07.881 --> 10:08.925
Hi.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.302
Hey.

10:12.265 --> 10:15.522
‐Did I doze off?
‐Mmm. It's the next day.

10:16.189 --> 10:19.446
You slept for 17 hours straight.

10:22.368 --> 10:23.370
Jesus.

10:24.330 --> 10:26.627
You, you remember when, um,

10:26.711 --> 10:31.637
when you used to wake up
from a long sleep, like, uh,

10:31.721 --> 10:33.516
like you'd really
achieved something?

10:33.892 --> 10:34.852
[chuckles]

10:35.562 --> 10:37.858
Well, I don't think
I ever got to 17 hours.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.446
Nope. That's a milestone.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.538
I guess everything
from here on out is a milestone.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.542
[chuckles] Yeah.

10:47.293 --> 10:48.128
Yeah, you're right.

10:51.552 --> 10:53.556
I can't believe you're here.
I just...

10:54.432 --> 10:55.560
It's...

11:04.369 --> 11:05.747
Do you want to come sit?

11:08.962 --> 11:10.590
Oh. Thanks.

11:21.904 --> 11:24.743
‐I missed room service.
‐Mmm. Yeah.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.458
‐Did you eat?
‐No, I... I sent it back.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.170
I couldn't eat for some reason.

11:30.630 --> 11:31.799
Sorry.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.597
What? You got nothing
to be sorry about.

11:35.222 --> 11:37.644
Don't you know, like,
ever since the boat,

11:37.728 --> 11:39.982
when you were apologizing,
that's crazy.

11:40.065 --> 11:42.445
I should be the one
that's apologizing.

11:46.704 --> 11:47.623
June...

11:49.960 --> 11:51.254
I tried to get you out.

11:52.173 --> 11:53.133
I did.

11:54.135 --> 11:56.891
And I tried to find Hannah,

11:58.268 --> 11:59.939
and I tried every day.

12:01.191 --> 12:03.529
‐And I failed, and I'm sorry.
‐No, please‐‐

12:03.613 --> 12:05.240
No, I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.159
Please, don't‐‐

12:06.242 --> 12:10.502
I don't blame you
if you can't forgive me.

12:11.837 --> 12:14.300
'Cause I can't forgive me.

12:15.887 --> 12:16.889
So...

12:31.585 --> 12:36.595
Luke, Hannah knows
how much we love her.

12:36.679 --> 12:39.058
‐It's been too long for that‐‐
‐No, she remembers us,

12:39.142 --> 12:41.312
and she knows how hard
we tried to find her.

12:41.396 --> 12:43.233
‐How could she?
‐'Cause I told her.

12:47.909 --> 12:48.911
What?

12:49.747 --> 12:50.832
How?

12:53.336 --> 12:54.757
It was at this lake house.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.182
They let me see her
for about 10 minutes.

13:02.104 --> 13:03.733
Is she... How is she?

13:14.630 --> 13:16.341
She's really big.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.059
[sniffles]

13:21.811 --> 13:23.480
She was beautiful.

13:25.985 --> 13:27.321
And she was mad.

13:27.823 --> 13:29.367
‐She was mad?
‐Mmm‐hmm.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.083
She asked if I tried
to find her.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.711
And I said...

13:35.420 --> 13:37.049
I said of course I did,

13:37.551 --> 13:39.137
and that I had tried so hard.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.015
And that so had her daddy.

13:42.059 --> 13:45.692
And then she asked
why didn't I try harder.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.988
[chuckles] That sounds like her.

13:48.071 --> 13:49.156
Yeah.

13:51.286 --> 13:52.914
She was our Hannah.

13:54.585 --> 13:55.587
Okay?

14:00.178 --> 14:03.519
[sniffles] And... and so
what did you say?

14:06.609 --> 14:09.322
I said it was okay
to be mad at me.

14:12.202 --> 14:15.042
And that I wished that
I could have been with her,

14:15.793 --> 14:17.129
to protect her.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.968
And that I was so sorry
that I couldn't.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.726
But that I would
always be her mommy.

14:28.903 --> 14:31.575
And that her daddy and I
would always love her

14:33.203 --> 14:35.123
and we would never stop.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.419
[sobs]

14:38.004 --> 14:39.173
You're a good mother.

14:39.256 --> 14:40.969
‐You're a really good mother.
‐No.

14:41.052 --> 14:45.018
‐Yeah, you are.
‐No, I'm not.

14:45.102 --> 14:47.189
You are. You are. You are.

14:58.003 --> 15:00.090
It was a bartender at Jezebel's.

15:01.844 --> 15:02.971
Did you know his name?

15:03.514 --> 15:05.768
Billy. I don't know
his last name.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.356
He was Asian, skinny.

15:09.191 --> 15:10.277
He went by Billy.

15:12.031 --> 15:16.582
You didn't have any coordination
with anyone from outside Gilead?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.045
Americans in exile? Canadians?

15:19.796 --> 15:20.923
No. None.

15:23.303 --> 15:26.560
It's amazing you managed
to get those kids out.

15:28.271 --> 15:30.985
What motivated you
to risk your life,

15:31.570 --> 15:34.033
everything, to do such a thing?

15:35.578 --> 15:37.289
It was the only thing
I could do.

15:38.124 --> 15:39.293
What do you mean?

15:39.376 --> 15:41.507
I made a promise
that they would hurt.

15:44.303 --> 15:45.556
The way we hurt.

15:47.142 --> 15:48.144
Who?

15:49.313 --> 15:50.482
The kidnappers.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.279
The Serenas.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.753
I thought about
what she would deserve.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.468
What they deserved.

16:11.567 --> 16:13.696
They take everything from you.

16:15.658 --> 16:16.827
You know?

16:20.292 --> 16:21.670
They really do.

16:25.468 --> 16:28.642
[clears throat]
You wanna take a break?

16:30.938 --> 16:32.942
‐Is that okay?
‐Of course.

16:37.284 --> 16:38.537
When is Nichole coming?

16:38.621 --> 16:40.498
[Mark] I believe
your friend Moira

16:40.583 --> 16:42.127
will be bringing her by later

16:42.211 --> 16:43.463
when we're done.

16:44.340 --> 16:47.137
We can be done now, if you want.

16:48.515 --> 16:50.728
Do you want me
to take you home to see her?

16:51.855 --> 16:55.111
[Mark] It's best to debrief
while your memories are fresh.

16:55.195 --> 16:56.782
They tend to degrade over time

16:56.865 --> 16:58.661
and then, they can
become contaminated

16:58.744 --> 16:59.788
with new experiences.

16:59.871 --> 17:02.417
We can debrief later
at the embassy.

17:02.502 --> 17:04.714
Right now,
I'm gonna take my wife home.

17:05.131 --> 17:06.718
I wanna go see our daughter.

17:09.348 --> 17:10.518
[Mark] I understand.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.544
[Luke] This is home.

17:24.504 --> 17:26.007

‐[Emily] Hi, sweetheart.

17:36.987 --> 17:39.199
Let's fix this sock right
for Mommy. Yeah.

17:39.618 --> 17:40.661
‐[Nichole cooing]
‐[chuckles]

17:40.745 --> 17:43.458
Aw, look. Momma's here early.

17:44.001 --> 17:45.713
And we wanted
to have her all ready.

17:48.426 --> 17:49.512
June.

17:52.184 --> 17:53.269
Emily.

18:01.369 --> 18:03.164
[cooing]

18:04.918 --> 18:06.003
Shh.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.562
[Nichole cooing]

18:29.676 --> 18:32.055
You're so amazing.
You know that?

18:33.433 --> 18:34.936
So, so amazing.

18:35.019 --> 18:36.565
Why are you so amazing?

18:37.900 --> 18:39.278
I know why.

18:40.238 --> 18:42.492
'Cause Luke and Moira
are raising you.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.002
We're so lucky, aren't we?

18:51.260 --> 18:52.513
I also want you to know

18:52.597 --> 18:54.517
that your daddy and I
love you so much.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.853
‐[coos]
‐[chuckles]

18:57.899 --> 18:59.234
Your first daddy.

19:09.798 --> 19:10.925
[Serena] Dear God...

19:11.843 --> 19:14.599
thank You for allowing
my pregnancy to reach this week.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.062
I know I have sinned,

19:17.145 --> 19:19.567
and I know I have not always
behaved with light in my heart,

19:19.651 --> 19:20.986
and I am sorry.

19:21.822 --> 19:23.909
Whatever I can do to repent

19:23.992 --> 19:26.372
and redeem myself
in your eyes, I will do it.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.209
Please,

19:29.504 --> 19:32.133
please, Lord,
let me have a healthy baby.

19:34.054 --> 19:36.560
Please do not punish him
for the sins of his mother.

19:37.352 --> 19:41.318
And please give me the strength
to parent him on my own.

19:49.293 --> 19:51.213
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.177
Of course you did.

19:55.764 --> 19:57.058
Did you hear everything?

19:58.979 --> 20:00.023
I heard a lot.

20:01.651 --> 20:03.154
Does it satisfy you to hear

20:03.237 --> 20:05.534
someone from Gilead
express misgivings?

20:07.830 --> 20:09.792
Does it satisfy you
to express them?

20:11.588 --> 20:12.673
You're punchy.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.886
Have you seen her?

20:15.596 --> 20:16.514
Who?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.938
My lawyer told me she was here.

20:20.271 --> 20:21.942
She said it would
complicate my case.

20:22.025 --> 20:23.402
Not that you care about that.

20:23.486 --> 20:25.114
I leave the legal stuff
to the lawyers.

20:25.198 --> 20:26.408
And what are you?

20:27.452 --> 20:28.538
Just a pot‐stirrer?

20:32.045 --> 20:34.634
Your husband has renewed
his request to see you again,

20:34.717 --> 20:36.261
as he has every day

20:36.345 --> 20:38.307
since finding out he's a father.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.775
A sperm donor.

20:43.902 --> 20:46.281
And now that she's here,
he's afraid.

20:48.996 --> 20:50.415
I don't want to see him.

20:50.498 --> 20:51.626
Why should I?

20:51.710 --> 20:54.089
He does not want to be fighting
a two‐front war

20:54.172 --> 20:55.592
against the both of you.

20:57.387 --> 20:59.851
You likely have more
influence over him now.

21:00.936 --> 21:03.357
If you can get him
to cooperate more,

21:03.984 --> 21:05.403
it could help the both of us.

21:10.329 --> 21:11.498
[door opens]

21:13.795 --> 21:14.922
[door closes]

21:21.018 --> 21:24.191
"As newborn babes desire
the sincere milk of the word,

21:24.274 --> 21:26.070
that they may grow thereby...

21:28.784 --> 21:29.786
If so be...

21:30.119 --> 21:32.290
[inhales and exhales deeply]

21:34.252 --> 21:36.758
you have tasted
that the Lord is gracious."

21:36.841 --> 21:37.927
Back off, Fred.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.893
I'm grateful to you for coming.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.270
Nothing has changed between us.

21:43.354 --> 21:44.690
Everything has changed.

21:45.233 --> 21:47.487
The world has tilted
on its axis.

21:48.155 --> 21:50.828
God has granted us
a child of our own, Serena.

21:50.911 --> 21:52.455
He wants us to be together.

21:52.540 --> 21:55.461
It's not your place to guess
at the intentions of God.

21:57.048 --> 21:59.219
I want to be a good father
to my son.

22:06.358 --> 22:07.736
And a good husband to you,

22:08.613 --> 22:09.782
if you'll let me.

22:10.909 --> 22:12.412
It's too late for that, Fred.

22:12.495 --> 22:14.207
Our pregnancy is proof
that it's not.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.003
My pregnancy.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.548
This pregnancy belongs to me

22:17.631 --> 22:19.719
just as much as Offred's
belonged to you.

22:21.764 --> 22:22.766
Guard!

22:25.313 --> 22:26.356
[knocking on door]

22:26.858 --> 22:30.114
Listen, our legal landscape
has changed as well.

22:32.035 --> 22:35.542
With Offred now in Canada,
we can't be naive about that.

22:35.626 --> 22:38.005
She could put us both away
for the maximum sentence

22:38.088 --> 22:40.636
and prevent you from being
a mother to your son.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.602
And what is there
to be done about that?

22:44.685 --> 22:46.522
We need to drop our fight

22:47.608 --> 22:49.528
and team up to help each other.

22:52.993 --> 22:53.912
Team up.

22:53.995 --> 22:56.500
I'll recant my testimony
against you.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.466
I'll do whatever it takes to
ensure a good life for our son.

23:05.101 --> 23:06.186
Why wouldn't you?

23:13.450 --> 23:15.121

23:38.710 --> 23:41.214
[Moira] You know, Emily wants
to know when she can come by.

23:41.674 --> 23:44.262
‐She made banana bread.
‐[Luke] Yup.

23:44.346 --> 23:47.060
Rita's gonna bring over
some muffins or something.

23:47.143 --> 23:48.980
‐[Moira] Mmm.
‐[Luke] Folks gotta bake.

23:49.481 --> 23:52.863
Do you want some of Aunt Emily's
banana bread, babycakes?

23:52.946 --> 23:54.658
‐[Nichole babbles]
‐Banana bread!

23:54.742 --> 23:55.952
‐[Luke] Hmm?
‐[June] Hello.

23:56.286 --> 23:57.455
‐Oh, hey. Morning.
‐Hey!

23:57.539 --> 23:59.585
‐[Luke] You sleep all right?
‐Yeah.

23:59.919 --> 24:02.508
Uh, [clears throat]
I made pancakes.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.221
‐You want some?
‐Sure.

24:05.889 --> 24:08.060
Hi, sweetie. Good morning.

24:08.143 --> 24:09.855
[Moira] You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd go shopping.

24:09.939 --> 24:11.567
‐[Luke] Hmm?
‐[Moira] Get some groceries.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.320
I feel like we're
out of everything.

24:13.404 --> 24:14.824
[Luke] Pancakes are up.

24:15.032 --> 24:16.368
[Moira] And we can
get outta your hair.

24:16.451 --> 24:17.746
Give you guys some time.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.667
And I can take this
little one with me.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.585
Yeah?

24:20.669 --> 24:22.463
[Luke] Yeah, that would
be great. Thank you.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.846
Yeah? Of course.
Come on, baby girl. Up!

24:26.931 --> 24:28.560
The spoon? Oopah!

24:29.352 --> 24:31.440
Whatcha looking at?
You wanna get ready?

24:31.524 --> 24:32.901
Hey, could you wait for me?

24:34.780 --> 24:35.949
You want to go
to the supermarket?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.997
You just got here.
Could be overwhelming.

24:39.080 --> 24:39.999
Culture shock.

24:40.082 --> 24:42.754
I've been living in Gilead.
All I want is culture shock.

24:43.923 --> 24:45.009
Yeah.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.725
Maybe we could invite
Rita and Emily over tonight too.

24:50.269 --> 24:51.271
You sure?

24:51.647 --> 24:53.192
Yeah. I'd like to meet Oliver.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.070
[Luke] Uh‐huh.

24:55.404 --> 24:57.659
‐[Moira] They'll be thrilled.
‐[Luke] Great.

You're good?

25:14.818 --> 25:15.987
Yeah. Good.

25:31.309 --> 25:33.856
What happened to potato chips
in the last seven years?

25:33.940 --> 25:35.694
Oh, they made them healthy.

25:36.236 --> 25:38.282
I know, it's a travesty.

25:38.533 --> 25:39.660
[Nichole babbling]

25:39.785 --> 25:41.706
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

25:41.789 --> 25:44.587
Yeah, I have got to go
change her. Right now.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.716
And then we have got
to get her home for a nap.

25:46.799 --> 25:47.634
All right.

25:47.718 --> 25:48.928
She is like 10 minutes
from a breakdown

25:49.012 --> 25:50.724
and you know that is not pretty.

25:50.807 --> 25:52.686
All right, I'm gonna
finish up shopping.

25:52.769 --> 25:54.272
Uh, milk, eggs, oatmeal.

25:54.355 --> 25:56.652
‐Milk, eggs, oatmeal. Got it.
‐Fuck!

25:56.736 --> 25:58.113
‐What?
‐No diapers!

25:58.196 --> 25:59.407
I got you.

26:03.498 --> 26:05.210
Nice. Love you!

[exhales]

26:18.738 --> 26:21.159
Uh, I'll get the chips
and meet you at checkout?

26:21.242 --> 26:23.080
I'm gonna need some time
to decide.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.376
All right.

26:27.631 --> 26:30.135
[woman] We gotta go! We're late.
Come on, come on, come on!

26:34.227 --> 26:36.649
‐What? For like‐for dinner?
‐Let's do it.

26:37.191 --> 26:39.655
Come on. We deserve it.

[Janine] Handmaids always
walk in twos, remember?

27:48.876 --> 27:49.920
[echoing] Remember?

27:50.003 --> 27:51.130
‐No, no, no, please!
‐[Hannah screams]

27:51.297 --> 27:52.299

Bye.

[Luke] All right, you go! Go!
Run, run, run!

Do you understand me?

[Moira] Who is that
knocking at my door?

28:32.631 --> 28:35.052
Okay, wait.
No monkeys allowed in my house.

28:35.135 --> 28:36.095
Are you a monkey?

28:36.179 --> 28:38.809
‐No.
‐Then get in here. [laughs]

28:38.893 --> 28:42.066
Oh, yes, thank you.
I have been waiting for this.

28:42.149 --> 28:44.529
[Emily] I made two.
One mysteriously disappeared.

28:44.613 --> 28:46.407
[Moira] Oh, mysteriously?

28:46.491 --> 28:49.121
[Luke] Yo! Dude. Dude, yo.
How'd you get so big?

28:49.205 --> 28:50.040
[Oliver] I dunno.

28:50.123 --> 28:51.501
[Luke] Nobody told me
you were gonna be this big.

28:51.585 --> 28:52.587
Come on. Come on in.

28:53.756 --> 28:54.591
So, what do you want?

28:55.635 --> 28:57.514
[Oliver] Uh, can we play
the new Fortnite?

28:57.597 --> 28:59.100
[Luke] No, because
I don't play that anymore.

28:59.183 --> 29:00.018
[Oliver] What?

29:00.102 --> 29:01.396
[Luke laughs] All right,
we can play it.

29:01.479 --> 29:02.314
Hi.

29:03.149 --> 29:05.655
Hey. This is Oliver.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.746
Hi. Nice to meet you.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.132
Can I get a hug?

29:22.229 --> 29:23.356
Can I get some of that?

29:29.745 --> 29:30.830
Rita.

29:31.957 --> 29:35.255
You made it.
Praise effing be, you made it.

29:35.590 --> 29:36.424
[June] Yeah.

29:40.140 --> 29:40.975
[soft music playing on record]

29:41.058 --> 29:43.564
She's been working late a lot.
But, um, it's good,

29:43.647 --> 29:44.941
‐she likes her job.
‐Yeah?

29:45.025 --> 29:46.779
And it's not just
about avoiding me.

29:46.862 --> 29:48.616
Of course
she's not avoiding you.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.035
I'm still looking
for the right time

29:50.118 --> 29:51.412
to move back into her...

29:52.247 --> 29:53.709
‐bedroom.
‐There's no judgment.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.047
She's so patient
and kind and...

29:56.507 --> 29:58.384
I just wish she didn't have
to deal with this special case.

29:58.468 --> 30:01.307
We all left that place
totally fucked up about sex.

30:01.390 --> 30:02.727
You found Oona.

30:02.811 --> 30:04.313
And fucked that one up too.

30:05.232 --> 30:06.652
No, I did. That was my fault.

30:06.735 --> 30:07.570
No, see that?

30:07.654 --> 30:09.699
Don't bring that
Aunt Lydia shit in here.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.829
This is a Lydia‐free zone, okay?

30:11.912 --> 30:13.164
She can't get us here.

30:13.791 --> 30:14.751
[Moira] None of 'em can.

30:18.383 --> 30:20.470
Do you guys ever wonder
if you deserve this?

30:22.976 --> 30:24.353
If you deserve to be here?

30:26.859 --> 30:29.363
Sometimes I think about
what I did.

30:30.950 --> 30:31.994
When I was there.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.585
[Moira] We did what
we had to do.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.337
To survive.

30:38.507 --> 30:39.509
To get out.

30:42.389 --> 30:43.684
But we're here, ladies.

30:45.521 --> 30:46.439
We won.

30:46.523 --> 30:47.482
Mmm‐hmm.

30:47.567 --> 30:48.903
They tried to
fucking destroy us,

30:48.986 --> 30:50.740
and we won. Yay.

30:54.706 --> 30:56.585
What do you guys know
about Serena?

30:57.587 --> 30:58.589
[Moira] Serena?

30:58.964 --> 30:59.966
[June] Yeah.

31:00.216 --> 31:01.469
Have you heard anything?

31:06.270 --> 31:07.189
What?

31:10.780 --> 31:11.865
I saw her.

31:15.998 --> 31:16.833
Well?

31:18.419 --> 31:19.296
How?

31:20.591 --> 31:21.510
Why?

31:22.679 --> 31:23.973
She wanted my help.

31:24.933 --> 31:26.895
You know her.
Total narcissist.

31:28.106 --> 31:29.483
What did she want?

31:32.573 --> 31:33.575
Just tell me.

31:41.550 --> 31:42.802
[Rita] She's pregnant.

31:56.078 --> 31:57.164
Is it his?

31:59.794 --> 32:01.297
Is it the Commander's?

32:03.886 --> 32:04.971
[Rita] Yes.

32:21.505 --> 32:22.590
Fuck her.

32:24.426 --> 32:25.261
I don't care.

32:25.345 --> 32:28.059
‐Yup, exactly.
‐That's right. Fuck her.

32:28.142 --> 32:30.396
She looked awful, right?

32:30.480 --> 32:32.275
‐Oh! Oh, she looked like shit.
‐[Moira] Right?

32:32.359 --> 32:33.695
[Emily] How tight was her bun?

32:33.779 --> 32:35.490
‐[Rita] No, it was a rat's nest.
‐[laughter]

32:35.574 --> 32:39.624
Alcohol, right? We need,
we need some more alcohol.

32:51.063 --> 32:51.898
Oona!

32:53.484 --> 32:54.319
Hey.

32:56.157 --> 32:57.827
I was just dropping
something off.

32:59.163 --> 33:00.206
For June.

33:00.290 --> 33:03.212
Um, well,
do you want to come in?

33:04.924 --> 33:07.763
Nah, this was just
on my way home from work.

33:09.559 --> 33:10.895
How is work?

33:10.978 --> 33:13.775
Uh, we're not allowed back
into Gilead.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.779
Or anywhere outside
of Canada, for now.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.119
I'm sorry.

33:20.539 --> 33:22.668
Does it help that you
brought in this, uh,

33:22.752 --> 33:24.631
major intelligence asset?

33:26.467 --> 33:29.223
Probably the reason why
we still have a fighting chance.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.772
It's really nice of you
to bring her a gift.

33:33.481 --> 33:36.195
I mean, seeing as we almost
killed your NGO and all.

33:36.613 --> 33:39.577
Well, I nearly left her to die
in Gilead,

33:40.495 --> 33:41.497
so...

33:42.750 --> 33:44.253
guess we're about even?

33:46.298 --> 33:47.300
See ya.

33:48.971 --> 33:50.641
You know,
I think the world of you.

33:52.269 --> 33:53.605
I don't want us to be over.

33:56.485 --> 34:01.245
You chose your friend over me,
and my work, and your work.

34:02.873 --> 34:04.794
I know where I stand with you,
and it's fine.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.424
That's not where you stand,
and it's not fine.

34:07.508 --> 34:08.760
Look, I'm not angry.

34:08.844 --> 34:10.471
And I don't want
to fight about this.

34:10.556 --> 34:12.768
No, we have to.
We have to have the fight,

34:12.852 --> 34:14.564
'cause if we, if we don't,

34:14.647 --> 34:16.066
then we can't move on.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.868
We can't move on.

34:25.919 --> 34:27.047
[car door opens]

34:28.717 --> 34:30.721
You know, I've been moving on
my whole life.

34:32.808 --> 34:37.526
Until I met Odette, and she was
forever until she wasn't, so...

34:40.949 --> 34:43.997
I... I just feel like maybe
you could be forever.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.922
‐Maybe.
‐[chuckles]

34:54.977 --> 34:57.065
Okay, you wanna have the fight?
Let's have the fight.

34:57.900 --> 35:00.321
Just not on a night
where I'm freezing my arse off.

35:03.578 --> 35:04.664
Call me.

35:08.964 --> 35:10.341
[car starting]

35:14.600 --> 35:15.978
[chuckles]

35:18.942 --> 35:20.111
[exhales]

35:30.047 --> 35:32.051
Did you have fun?

35:32.135 --> 35:34.055
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

36:19.939 --> 36:21.734
‐[gasps]
‐Ooh, sorry.

36:23.445 --> 36:25.408
No. It's okay. It's okay.

36:25.491 --> 36:27.538
‐You sure?
‐Yeah. It's okay. Yeah.

36:32.673 --> 36:35.136
‐Sorry.
‐No, no, no. It's fine.

36:35.219 --> 36:36.221
It's fine.

36:36.806 --> 36:38.392
‐[exhales]
‐No, sorry. I shouldn't have‐‐

36:38.475 --> 36:40.021
No, it's okay, it's okay.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.317
‐It's my fault.
‐No, no.

36:44.572 --> 36:45.824
So, do you‐‐

37:28.910 --> 37:30.121
Thanks for coming.

37:31.289 --> 37:32.375
Any time.

37:45.359 --> 37:46.779
[door beeps, unlocks]

38:10.744 --> 38:12.748
I prayed for this chance.

38:16.046 --> 38:18.425
And I humbly thank the Lord
for your visit.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.475
You would.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.734
You never did give me
credit for anything.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.661
[Mark] I'll be next door
if you need anything.

38:38.006 --> 38:39.217
[door closes]

38:40.804 --> 38:43.768
I believe that the Lord
brought you here

38:46.148 --> 38:48.152
so that I could make amends.

38:51.742 --> 38:52.953
I brought myself here,

38:53.036 --> 38:56.544
so that I could tell you
how much I hate you.

39:00.886 --> 39:03.390
You don't deserve
to make amends to anyone.

39:06.772 --> 39:09.612
The only thing
that you deserve

39:10.530 --> 39:12.659
is a life full of suffering

39:13.912 --> 39:15.122
and shame.

39:17.501 --> 39:21.176
You have destroyed... my life,

39:22.596 --> 39:23.848
my family,

39:24.558 --> 39:26.061
my friends,

39:27.230 --> 39:28.650
my country,

39:29.902 --> 39:31.363
and my child.

39:34.452 --> 39:39.880
There is no one
less worthy of redemption

39:41.049 --> 39:42.552
than you.

39:49.065 --> 39:50.234
I'm sorry.

40:02.801 --> 40:07.101
I am begging
for your forgiveness,

40:09.230 --> 40:12.738
and I'm begging
for the Lord's mercy

40:14.616 --> 40:16.746
and for His understanding.

40:19.793 --> 40:23.593
Do you know why God
made you pregnant?

40:27.224 --> 40:32.318
So that when He kills that baby
inside your womb,

40:32.401 --> 40:37.495
you will feel a fraction
of the pain

40:37.579 --> 40:39.415
that you caused us

40:39.499 --> 40:43.800
when you tore our children
from our arms!

40:43.883 --> 40:46.262
Do you understand me?

40:50.187 --> 40:51.147
[whimpers]

40:52.191 --> 40:55.280
Do you understand me?

40:59.122 --> 41:00.708
[sobs]

41:47.719 --> 41:49.138
Hey.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.654
Uh. What time is it?

42:04.252 --> 42:05.420
June.

42:11.809 --> 42:13.019
[moans softly]

42:18.990 --> 42:21.244
[breathing heavily]

42:25.753 --> 42:26.922
[moaning]

42:41.200 --> 42:42.579
All right. June, wait.

42:43.539 --> 42:45.000
Wait, wait, wait.

42:46.044 --> 42:47.964
June, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

42:50.177 --> 42:52.097
[breathing heavily]

42:55.605 --> 42:57.609
[moaning]

43:04.163 --> 43:06.000
[panting]

43:25.163 --> 43:26.750
[birds chirping]

43:27.627 --> 43:29.548
[Nichole cooing]

43:31.300 --> 43:32.929
‐[Nichole babbling]
‐[Luke laughing]

43:33.096 --> 43:34.473
‐Whoo!
‐[Nichole laughing]

43:37.772 --> 43:39.526
[Luke] Hey, you wanna go
and see Mommy?

43:39.860 --> 43:41.320
[Luke babbling]

43:43.534 --> 43:44.870
There you go.

43:45.788 --> 43:46.832
Who's that?

43:46.915 --> 43:48.627
[June] She's pathological.

43:50.130 --> 43:51.842
She's a sociopath.

43:53.846 --> 43:57.269
She's toxic. And abusive.

43:58.939 --> 44:00.442
She's a monster.

44:03.114 --> 44:05.076
And, by the way,
a consummate actress.

44:07.039 --> 44:08.124
[Mark] What do you think
drives her?

44:10.880 --> 44:14.888
Hatred. And rage.

44:17.811 --> 44:22.904
And underneath all of that,
there's nothing but pure misery.

44:24.908 --> 44:26.537
I need you, Fred.

44:40.523 --> 44:43.319
[June] And she'll do anything
not to feel that way.

44:48.789 --> 44:50.877
Anything to feel okay.

44:53.089 --> 44:54.926
[Commander Fred]
Praise be His mercy.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.765
[June] Even just for a second.

44:59.059 --> 45:00.061
[Luke] We got
tri‐dextrous here!

45:00.145 --> 45:02.734
[June] She'll do anything
to get what she wants.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.115
Lie to you.

45:06.198 --> 45:07.994
‐Nice to meet you!
‐[Nichole babbling]

45:09.789 --> 45:10.625
Yeah. He crazy.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.085
Hurt you.

45:13.923 --> 45:15.258
Rape you.

45:16.887 --> 45:20.895
So, if you feel yourself
getting sucked in by her...

45:23.358 --> 45:24.527
run.

45:29.161 --> 45:30.790
Run for your life.
