WEBVTT

01:10.351 --> 01:13.218
We going to find anything
in this mess?

01:13.220 --> 01:16.088
Best time to hunt.

01:16.090 --> 01:17.122
Rain cover noise,

01:17.124 --> 01:19.525
allow us to sneak up
on game.

01:19.527 --> 01:20.825
Well, rain or no rain,

01:20.827 --> 01:23.028
I'm happy not to be sitting
behind my desk.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.930
<i>Scott, come in.
Are you there?</i>

01:24.932 --> 01:26.398
Yeah--yeah, Charlie.
Go ahead.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.666
<i>Yeah, I can't find my guide.</i>

01:27.668 --> 01:29.034
<i>I stopped to take a piss,</i>

01:29.036 --> 01:30.936
<i>and I don't know
where the hell he is.</i>

01:30.938 --> 01:33.105
My brother can't find
his guide.

01:33.107 --> 01:35.340
Listen, just hang tight.

01:35.342 --> 01:37.376
We're about 30 meters
west of you.

01:39.012 --> 01:40.011
<i>Mitch, do you copy?</i>

01:40.013 --> 01:41.380
<i>What's your 20?
Over.</i>

01:41.382 --> 01:42.814
<i>I don't like this, Scott.</i>

01:42.816 --> 01:44.015
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

01:44.017 --> 01:45.551
Now, don't freak out on me,
little bro.

01:45.553 --> 01:47.786
<i>It's probably just--</i>

01:47.788 --> 01:50.689
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

01:54.828 --> 01:56.628
Charlie.
Charlie.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.097
<i>It's not me.</i>

01:58.099 --> 01:59.798
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

01:59.800 --> 02:01.032
Mitch?

02:01.034 --> 02:02.901
<i>Mitch, do you copy?
Over.</i>

02:17.684 --> 02:20.519
What the hell
was that?

02:20.521 --> 02:23.655
I don't know.

02:25.326 --> 02:27.559
We are being hunted.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.705
Charlie.

02:40.707 --> 02:42.474
Come on, Charlie.
Talk to me.

03:12.306 --> 03:13.905
Charlie?

03:49.643 --> 03:52.911
Scott!

03:52.913 --> 03:57.583
Scott, hang on.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.918
Don't die on me, bro.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.720
Hang on!

04:01.722 --> 04:03.622
No!

04:17.671 --> 04:21.440
Here you go.
You're all set.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.475
Thank you.

04:39.393 --> 04:41.660
Hey.
So I got it.

04:41.662 --> 04:43.295
What took so long?

04:43.297 --> 04:45.030
<i>Sorry--
It's almost noon.</i>

04:45.032 --> 04:46.632
Let's head
for the hills.

04:46.634 --> 04:47.633
<i>Wait, guys.</i>

04:47.635 --> 04:49.034
<i>I've got to return the original</i>

04:49.036 --> 04:50.201
to my step-dad's key chain.

04:50.203 --> 04:52.738
If I don't, he'll kill me.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.105
Jesus, have a little backbone.

04:54.107 --> 04:55.674
You said he was headed
out of town, dude.

04:55.676 --> 04:56.875
He won't notice
it's missing.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.911
Oh, believe me.
He'll notice.

04:58.913 --> 05:01.112
<i>Look, I'm not going
if I can't return the key.</i>

05:01.114 --> 05:02.548
Plus, we got to pick up
my friend, remember?

05:02.550 --> 05:04.883
All right,
we'll swing by your house.

05:04.885 --> 05:06.251
But make it quick.

05:06.253 --> 05:08.320
Okay.

05:17.130 --> 05:20.365
Hey, can you keep an eye out
for Sam for me?

05:20.367 --> 05:21.700
One second.

05:23.070 --> 05:24.803
Who the hell
is Sam?

05:24.805 --> 05:26.371
An old high school
buddy, I think.

05:26.373 --> 05:28.073
What, is Derek gay?

05:28.075 --> 05:29.675
How the hell do I know?

05:29.677 --> 05:31.810
All I know is, he's our ticket
to a free place to party.

05:35.082 --> 05:36.281
<i>Just go; I don't care.</i>

05:37.317 --> 05:38.884
<i>What is it, dear?</i>

05:38.886 --> 05:39.985
Hey.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.253
Hey.

05:42.255 --> 05:43.421
I thought you left.

05:43.423 --> 05:44.456
<i>Almost, I just need</i>

05:44.458 --> 05:45.958
a little money.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.560
Sure.
Hand me my purse.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.666
Jesus.

05:54.668 --> 05:56.668
For what?

05:56.670 --> 05:58.203
<i>Derek's going camping
with his friends</i>

05:58.205 --> 05:59.270
from the fraternity.

05:59.272 --> 06:00.271
There you go.

06:00.273 --> 06:02.474
You're pledging the fraternity?

06:02.476 --> 06:04.376
It's the same one
my dad belonged to.

06:04.378 --> 06:06.879
You're not your dad,
kid.

06:06.881 --> 06:08.780
Yeah,
neither are you.

06:13.153 --> 06:14.219
What did you say?

06:14.221 --> 06:15.387
Nothing.

06:15.389 --> 06:17.022
Mitch.

06:17.024 --> 06:18.824
Just leave him alone.

06:18.826 --> 06:21.693
Leave him alone.

06:21.695 --> 06:22.895
Why are you always

06:22.897 --> 06:23.962
so mean to him?

06:23.964 --> 06:24.997
I was just asking him

06:24.999 --> 06:26.732
if he pledged
to the fraternity.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.333
<i>He doesn't seem
like the type.</i>

06:28.335 --> 06:29.601
<i>He's trying,</i>

06:29.603 --> 06:31.803
<i>which is more
than what you've been doing.</i>

06:31.805 --> 06:34.205
<i>Jesus, don't start.</i>

06:34.207 --> 06:37.709
<i>I'm not screwing around;
it's a business trip.</i>

06:37.711 --> 06:39.611
<i>What are you doing?</i>

06:41.281 --> 06:42.213
Nothing.

06:43.383 --> 06:45.216
Move.

06:48.856 --> 06:50.188
I gotta get out of here.

06:50.190 --> 06:51.256
<i>I'm late</i>

06:51.258 --> 06:53.224
for my big weekend fuckfest.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.500
Mom, why do you
put up with it?

07:02.502 --> 07:04.670
I don't know.

07:04.672 --> 07:07.305
He's nice sometimes.

07:07.307 --> 07:09.608
At least he used to be.

07:12.145 --> 07:13.178
I'm okay.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.479
Go, go,
have a good time.

07:14.481 --> 07:17.583
Okay.
Bye.

07:17.585 --> 07:19.250
Come on, man.

07:19.252 --> 07:20.385
Daylight's wasting.

07:20.387 --> 07:22.120
Just wait one second.
Sam's on her way.

07:22.122 --> 07:23.789
Hey, look, we've already
wasted an hour

07:23.791 --> 07:24.923
<i>with all this key shit.</i>

07:24.925 --> 07:25.924
If your friend ain't here,

07:25.926 --> 07:26.925
he's getting left behind.

07:34.768 --> 07:36.234
It's a girl.

07:36.236 --> 07:37.335
No way.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.370
Tell me she's not
coming with us.

07:39.372 --> 07:40.806
I don't know;
she looks like someone

07:40.808 --> 07:41.873
who knows how to party to me.

07:41.875 --> 07:42.874
Shut up.

07:42.876 --> 07:45.110
What?

07:45.112 --> 07:46.845
Hey.

07:46.847 --> 07:48.480
Hell, no.

07:48.482 --> 07:50.649
You don't really expect me
to get in that thing, do you?

07:50.651 --> 07:51.650
Oh, come on.
Please?

07:51.652 --> 07:53.284
You said you would.
Please?

07:53.286 --> 07:54.620
Do not make me go
with them alone.

07:54.622 --> 07:55.754
Why go at all?

07:55.756 --> 07:57.689
Because I'm pledging
their fraternity,

07:57.691 --> 07:58.790
and I made the mistake

07:58.792 --> 08:00.291
of mentioning
my step-dad's cabin,

08:00.293 --> 08:01.526
and it snowballed
from there.

08:01.528 --> 08:02.794
Mm, yes.

08:02.796 --> 08:05.296
<i>Well, that's your bed, dude.
You lie in it.</i>

08:05.298 --> 08:06.331
Please?

08:06.333 --> 08:07.532
Remember,
you wouldn't have

08:07.534 --> 08:09.434
graduated high school
without my help.

08:09.436 --> 08:11.069
<i>You wouldn't have survived
without mine.</i>

08:13.140 --> 08:15.206
I'm so going
to regret this.

08:20.981 --> 08:23.281
Uh, everybody,
this is Sam.

08:23.283 --> 08:24.783
<i>Sam, this is Cassie--</i>

08:24.785 --> 08:27.152
Ooh, let me guess.

08:27.154 --> 08:30.656
Muffy, Brittany,
Biff, and Chad.

08:30.658 --> 08:32.691
<i>Actually,</i>

08:32.693 --> 08:35.727
it's Cassie, Melissa,
Jason, and Alex.

08:35.729 --> 08:37.195
Hmm, close.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.364
Look, metalface,
why don't you just keep

08:39.366 --> 08:40.966
your smart-ass comments
to yourself?

08:40.967 --> 08:42.567
You know what--
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

08:42.568 --> 08:44.202
And we're out of here.

09:01.321 --> 09:04.422
Oh, my God.
Whatever.

09:15.769 --> 09:16.968
Hey, plebe?

09:16.970 --> 09:18.970
Where is this place?

09:18.972 --> 09:19.971
I don't know.

09:19.973 --> 09:21.539
I've actually
never been there.

09:21.541 --> 09:23.809
But, you know, the directions
I gave you from MapQuest--

09:23.811 --> 09:25.077
<i>Ain't worth shit.</i>

09:25.079 --> 09:26.411
We should have been there
an hour ago.

09:29.382 --> 09:31.382
God forbid we stop
and ask someone.

09:31.384 --> 09:34.252
Hey, hey, let's ask
that old dude up there.

09:43.697 --> 09:45.964
Hey, buddy.
You need some help?

09:45.966 --> 09:48.433
Well, yeah.

09:48.435 --> 09:50.836
She just gave up
the ghost.

09:50.838 --> 09:52.604
Ah, yes, the ghost.

09:52.606 --> 09:55.306
Well, did you check
this here distributor?

09:55.308 --> 09:57.776
<i>You don't know
what a fucking distributor is.</i>

09:57.778 --> 09:59.477
Get out of my way.

09:59.479 --> 10:01.780
What makes you think
you can do better?

10:01.782 --> 10:04.515
I'm a mechanic, dickhead.

10:04.517 --> 10:05.516
Do you mind?

10:05.518 --> 10:06.551
<i>Oh, no, go ahead.</i>

10:06.553 --> 10:09.020
She just cut out on me.

10:16.663 --> 10:18.363
You're going to have sex
with that?

10:18.365 --> 10:21.099
Yeah, I wish
he wouldn't drink so much.

10:21.101 --> 10:22.901
He's funnier around others
when he drinks,

10:22.903 --> 10:25.871
but when we're together,
he gets kind of weird.

10:27.908 --> 10:29.107
Yeah? How?

10:30.543 --> 10:31.943
Come on.

10:31.945 --> 10:34.946
He gets kind of kinky,
you know?

10:34.948 --> 10:36.681
He makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

10:36.683 --> 10:38.884
But everything else
about him is perfect.

10:38.886 --> 10:41.787
<i>I mean, he's the kind of guy</i>

10:41.789 --> 10:43.021
that I would imagine
marrying.

10:43.023 --> 10:44.022
You guys talked
about it?

10:44.024 --> 10:45.824
No.
What, you did?

10:45.826 --> 10:47.192
Alex wants
to fuck me so bad,

10:47.194 --> 10:49.895
I think he'll pop the question
just to get laid.

10:49.897 --> 10:51.096
Wow, um...

10:51.098 --> 10:52.164
I can't believe

10:52.166 --> 10:53.498
you've gotten him
to wait so long.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.066
You surrender
the pink too soon, honey,

10:55.068 --> 10:56.668
they're on
to the next thing.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.837
Alex is my ticket out
of middle America.

10:58.839 --> 11:00.705
I help him out
with a BJ now and then,

11:00.707 --> 11:02.174
but he won't get
what he wants

11:02.176 --> 11:03.842
until I get what I want.

11:03.844 --> 11:05.743
Gold digger.

11:05.745 --> 11:08.146
Hey, uh, maybe you could
help us too.

11:08.148 --> 11:09.948
We're looking for a cabin
on Bear Mountain.

11:09.950 --> 11:12.583
It's off Fire Road 13.

11:14.188 --> 11:16.354
Uh, you don't want
to go there.

11:16.356 --> 11:19.291
Well, that should do it.

11:19.293 --> 11:20.692
All right.

11:28.235 --> 11:29.734
All right.

11:29.736 --> 11:32.603
Hey, thank you.

11:32.605 --> 11:34.139
<i>You sure know your stuff.</i>

11:34.141 --> 11:36.708
The service station
could use you.

11:36.710 --> 11:39.777
Well, thanks,
but I'm a city girl.

11:39.779 --> 11:41.779
Yeah, I can see that.

11:42.883 --> 11:44.316
You going to help us
or what?

11:44.318 --> 11:48.353
If you got your heart set
on going up there...

11:48.355 --> 11:49.554
go back 15 miles.

11:49.556 --> 11:51.622
<i>You go to the base
of the mountain,</i>

11:51.624 --> 11:54.025
and you look for a dirt road.

11:54.027 --> 11:55.827
That's Fire Road 13.

11:55.829 --> 11:57.162
Thank you, sir.

11:58.465 --> 12:00.232
You shouldn't thank me.

12:00.234 --> 12:02.834
You should go back to the city.

12:02.836 --> 12:05.303
<i>But if you find
this cabin,</i>

12:05.305 --> 12:08.439
stay indoors.

12:10.978 --> 12:12.443
<i>What the fuck was that about?</i>

12:12.445 --> 12:13.478
<i>He's messing with us.</i>

12:13.480 --> 12:14.512
Let's get going.

12:14.514 --> 12:16.348
You heard him.
Maybe we should turn around.

12:16.350 --> 12:17.515
Come on.
He's an old drunk.

12:17.517 --> 12:19.717
He's probably scared
of his own shadow.

12:21.221 --> 12:22.787
Give it a break,
okay?

12:22.789 --> 12:24.622
You want to get laid
tonight or what?

12:24.624 --> 12:26.824
Maybe we should listen
to the man.

12:26.826 --> 12:28.326
I don't know.

12:28.328 --> 12:31.062
Are you scared too, huh?

12:31.064 --> 12:32.497
I bet our brothers
back at the house

12:32.499 --> 12:34.232
would be interested
to hear about that.

12:34.234 --> 12:35.400
No, I was just--

12:35.402 --> 12:37.369
No, no, no, get in
the fucking truck.

13:14.441 --> 13:15.506
I cannot believe

13:15.508 --> 13:17.809
you do not know
where this place is.

13:17.811 --> 13:18.944
I've never been there.

13:18.946 --> 13:20.278
I don't know where--
Great idea.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.779
Drive five hours
to a cabin

13:21.781 --> 13:23.348
when nobody knows
where the hell it is.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.549
Hey, Alex loves
a challenge.

13:24.551 --> 13:25.716
Shut up,
both of you, please.

13:25.718 --> 13:28.719
Hey, what's that
over there?

13:33.793 --> 13:37.228
<i>Ah, we are finally here.</i>

13:41.768 --> 13:43.901
<i>Let's get this party going.</i>

13:54.181 --> 13:56.814
You sure this is the place?

13:56.816 --> 13:59.650
I guess we're about
to find out, aren't we?

13:59.652 --> 14:01.786
Yeah.

14:11.764 --> 14:14.132
<i>Mm, yuck.</i>

14:14.134 --> 14:15.300
<i>How mundane.</i>

14:15.302 --> 14:19.604
I was hoping for something
more gothic.

14:19.606 --> 14:21.339
Get this party started!

14:21.341 --> 14:25.110
Yeah.

14:25.112 --> 14:26.878
See, there's nothing
to worry about.

14:30.517 --> 14:31.849
Goodies, goodies, goodies.

14:31.851 --> 14:34.986
Cassie and I will take
the bedroom.

14:34.988 --> 14:36.121
What?

14:36.123 --> 14:37.555
Sorry, there's only one.

14:37.557 --> 14:38.789
Well, we could all share.

14:38.791 --> 14:40.425
Fat chance.

14:40.427 --> 14:42.527
Where are we
supposed to sleep?

14:42.529 --> 14:43.528
<i>In here.</i>

14:43.530 --> 14:45.696
Um, it's a pull-out couch.

14:45.698 --> 14:47.399
And what about them?

14:47.401 --> 14:49.300
I'll sleep in the truck.

14:49.302 --> 14:51.069
See? We're all set.

14:51.071 --> 14:52.837
Now give me
that damn bottle.

14:52.839 --> 14:54.239
Yes, you do.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.307
Go, go, go,
go, go!

14:57.911 --> 14:58.876
<i>Attaboy.</i>

15:04.217 --> 15:05.816
For you.

15:17.897 --> 15:19.197
Ha ha.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.335
One for me and you.

15:24.337 --> 15:26.171
Let's do it.

15:31.478 --> 15:34.045
I like your tongue piercing.

15:34.047 --> 15:36.614
Thanks...I think.

15:36.616 --> 15:39.284
Do guys, like,
like the way it feels

15:39.286 --> 15:41.953
when you, you know?

15:41.955 --> 15:45.056
Why don't I blow your boyfriend,
and you can ask him?

15:45.058 --> 15:46.524
Bitch.

15:46.526 --> 15:48.059
I was just asking.

15:48.061 --> 15:51.296
And I was just telling.

15:54.401 --> 15:55.900
You really know how
to make friends.

15:55.902 --> 15:57.235
You know that?

15:57.237 --> 15:59.137
Mm, you sure know how
to pick 'em.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.316
God. Whoo!

16:16.923 --> 16:19.457
Oh, yes.

16:19.459 --> 16:20.391
Come here.

16:32.205 --> 16:34.139
What are you doing?

16:34.141 --> 16:37.142
Who's this
with Toblat?

16:37.144 --> 16:39.244
<i>That's, um...</i>

16:39.246 --> 16:42.480
that's my dad.

16:42.482 --> 16:45.116
But why would Mitch have
a picture of him here?

16:45.118 --> 16:47.252
I mean, we don't have
any pictures of him

16:47.254 --> 16:48.520
at home anymore.

16:48.522 --> 16:50.755
What, they were friends?

16:50.757 --> 16:53.525
Yeah, believe it
or not.

16:53.527 --> 16:55.593
Wait, so your dad
was a hunter.

16:55.595 --> 16:56.628
I guess so.

16:56.630 --> 16:59.497
I mean,
it's how he died.

16:59.499 --> 17:00.498
What?

17:00.500 --> 17:01.499
<i>Come on.</i>

17:02.702 --> 17:04.234
<i>Yeah, bring it on.</i>

17:07.174 --> 17:10.275
Hey, guys, could you
get off the table?

17:10.277 --> 17:12.577
Yeah, his daddy
might get mad.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.880
Can you try
and not break anything?

17:15.882 --> 17:17.147
Relax, kid.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.983
Just be glad we're pretending
to be your friends.

17:22.189 --> 17:23.921
Don't make him ask you again.

17:23.923 --> 17:26.790
Or what? You're going
to kick my ass?

17:26.792 --> 17:28.993
Oh, don't tempt me.

17:28.995 --> 17:32.230
Come on.
Get down.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.032
Dyke.

17:35.034 --> 17:36.334
Asshole.

17:36.336 --> 17:37.402
Hey, tough guy.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.404
Let's take our party
to the bedroom.

17:42.209 --> 17:43.408
We could take

17:43.410 --> 17:45.276
a little romantic walk
in the moonlight.

17:45.278 --> 17:46.377
Can you even walk?

17:46.379 --> 17:48.313
Oh, I can do a lot more
than that, baby.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.723
This totally sucks,

17:58.725 --> 18:01.359
and even thought
it was going to suck.

18:01.361 --> 18:03.328
I'm so out of here
in the morning,

18:03.330 --> 18:05.263
even if I have
to hike back.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.070
I'm scared.

18:13.072 --> 18:15.406
Yeah?
Don't worry, baby.

18:15.408 --> 18:18.610
I'll protect you
from anything.

18:23.783 --> 18:24.882
Well, let's just say

18:24.884 --> 18:26.384
you and I have
a little fantasy.

18:26.386 --> 18:29.787
Why? What you were
just doing was fun.

18:29.789 --> 18:31.589
Yeah, but let's just say
I'm a peeping tom

18:31.591 --> 18:32.657
and you caught me,

18:32.659 --> 18:34.158
and if I don't do
exactly what you say,

18:34.160 --> 18:36.527
you're going to call
the police.

18:36.529 --> 18:39.564
Well, why don't I tell you
to be romantic

18:39.566 --> 18:42.032
and make love to me?

18:42.034 --> 18:43.601
Yeah, yeah.

18:43.603 --> 18:47.505
Or--or you could just
make me take my clothes off,

18:47.507 --> 18:49.874
tell me to jerk off
in front of you

18:49.876 --> 18:51.876
and spank my ass
and make me wear your underwear

18:51.878 --> 18:52.943
and shit like that.

18:52.945 --> 18:54.579
What do you think?

18:54.581 --> 18:56.046
Come on;
what do you think, baby?

18:56.048 --> 18:58.149
Come on.

18:58.151 --> 19:01.586
Well, I don't want
to belittle you like that.

19:01.588 --> 19:02.987
I love you.

19:02.989 --> 19:05.323
Look, I'm just trying
to have a little fun, okay?

19:05.325 --> 19:06.891
If you want plain old
vanilla fucking,

19:06.893 --> 19:07.925
that's fine.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.160
That's not what I want.

19:09.162 --> 19:11.296
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

19:11.298 --> 19:14.265
Come on. Come on.
Come here. Come here.

19:18.772 --> 19:21.306
That's cool.

19:21.308 --> 19:24.241
You think your step-dad
ever used it?

19:24.243 --> 19:25.643
I don't know.

19:25.645 --> 19:28.846
I mean, it's Mitch.
What do you think?

19:31.618 --> 19:32.650
[groans]

19:32.652 --> 19:34.952
[laughs]

19:34.954 --> 19:36.253
Oh, I'm so glad

19:36.255 --> 19:38.356
you didn't bring me up here
just to bone me.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.259
I guarantee you
none of these people

19:42.261 --> 19:43.361
will be talking to each other

19:43.363 --> 19:46.431
<i>in three months,
maybe less.</i>

19:46.433 --> 19:48.032
I'm glad our relationship
isn't filled

19:48.034 --> 19:49.266
with that kind of bullshit.

19:49.268 --> 19:50.468
You know,

19:50.470 --> 19:53.037
<i>I've always cared
about you</i>

19:53.039 --> 19:56.240
more than any guy
I've ever slept with.

19:58.478 --> 20:00.545
Yeah, same here.

20:00.547 --> 20:04.382
You've always cared about me
more than any other guy

20:04.384 --> 20:05.450
<i>you've slept with?</i>

20:05.452 --> 20:07.184
You know what I mean.

20:07.186 --> 20:08.853
Don't be an ass, Sam.

20:08.855 --> 20:12.122
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

20:13.693 --> 20:15.693
Oh, fuck.

20:15.695 --> 20:17.528
All right.

20:17.530 --> 20:20.197
Well, I'm going to go
explore or something.

20:20.199 --> 20:22.900
Yeah.

20:22.902 --> 20:25.202
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

20:25.204 --> 20:28.406
That's--

20:28.408 --> 20:32.076
Ïh, God.

20:33.946 --> 20:35.246
Come here.

20:35.248 --> 20:36.681
What?
You didn't like that?

20:36.683 --> 20:37.749
I loved it,

20:37.751 --> 20:39.650
but I'm going
to love this even more.

20:40.754 --> 20:42.920
We talked about this.

20:42.922 --> 20:45.956
Not until there's a ring
on this finger, big boy.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.291
This is getting
ridiculous.

20:47.293 --> 20:50.428
I don't wait six days,
much less six months.

20:50.430 --> 20:54.932
I'll be worth it.
Believe me.

20:54.934 --> 20:59.904
I'm the dirtiest virgin
you could ever want, honey.

20:59.906 --> 21:02.707
I'll do anything else.

21:02.709 --> 21:03.775
Are you being honest?

21:05.745 --> 21:07.678
How about a little
backdoor action?

21:07.680 --> 21:08.880
Don't be a pervert.

21:08.882 --> 21:10.715
Launch sequence
is initiating.

21:10.717 --> 21:12.249
Ah! God!

21:12.251 --> 21:14.184
Launch scrubbed, stud.

21:14.186 --> 21:15.887
Why did you do that?

21:15.889 --> 21:17.388
Look, honey,
I love you,

21:17.390 --> 21:19.624
but the next time
you force yourself on me,

21:19.626 --> 21:22.326
I'll take the balls
with me.

21:24.764 --> 21:25.830
Bitch.

21:25.832 --> 21:27.264
<i>I heard that,
asshole.</i>

22:09.008 --> 22:10.942
Tell me what I want
to hear, baby.

22:10.944 --> 22:14.645
Are you even in?
I can't feel you.

22:14.647 --> 22:16.714
Yeah.

22:16.716 --> 22:18.415
You've got nothing for me.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.818
Oh, yeah.
Oh.

22:23.155 --> 22:24.254
Jeez.

22:24.256 --> 22:25.289
What was that?

22:25.291 --> 22:26.791
I--I don't know.

22:26.793 --> 22:28.258
It sounded close.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.462
It was probably just a--
just a dog.

22:31.464 --> 22:33.397
There's something
out there.

22:33.399 --> 22:34.465
It's circling us.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.233
I don't hear anything.

22:37.370 --> 22:39.069
Okay, maybe we should
get back to the cabin.

22:39.071 --> 22:40.705
Yeah.
Okay.

22:43.175 --> 22:44.609
Come on.

22:44.611 --> 22:47.111
Get your pants on.

22:50.683 --> 22:51.916
You are such--

22:54.787 --> 22:56.621
No!

23:04.163 --> 23:06.864
What was that?

23:06.866 --> 23:08.666
Stay here.

23:08.668 --> 23:09.901
Did you hear that?

23:09.903 --> 23:11.335
I'll take care of it.

23:24.183 --> 23:25.315
Come on!

23:28.555 --> 23:29.620
Come on!

23:29.622 --> 23:31.422
Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

23:46.706 --> 23:48.005
Get off of him!

24:14.433 --> 24:16.266
Shut up and get
some clothes on!

24:25.244 --> 24:27.544
<i>Little pigs, little pigs.</i>

24:27.546 --> 24:30.114
<i>Let me in.</i>

24:31.484 --> 24:35.152
<i>By the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin.</i>

24:35.154 --> 24:38.589
<i>Then I'll huff,
and I'll puff,</i>

24:38.591 --> 24:41.993
<i>and I'll rip your guts out!</i>

24:41.995 --> 24:45.562
What the fuck was that?

24:57.877 --> 24:59.576
Let me in!

24:59.578 --> 25:00.544
Hold on! I'm coming!

25:01.814 --> 25:02.813
Help me!

25:02.815 --> 25:04.615
<i>Hang on!
Help me!</i>

25:04.617 --> 25:06.250
Fuck!

25:06.252 --> 25:07.752
Alex!

25:22.135 --> 25:24.168
Get off her!

25:24.170 --> 25:25.169
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

25:25.171 --> 25:26.771
Get off her!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.112
No, no.

25:36.348 --> 25:37.281
No.

25:51.831 --> 25:53.664
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

25:53.666 --> 25:56.466
Was that your bitch, champ?

25:57.636 --> 25:59.904
Look out!

25:59.906 --> 26:02.773
Kid's got an ax.

26:05.812 --> 26:06.877
You animal.

26:06.879 --> 26:08.212
She was a virgin.

26:08.214 --> 26:11.248
Well, she ain't anymore.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.184
Come on, you sick fuck!

26:13.186 --> 26:14.985
You didn't get any of that, boy?

26:21.427 --> 26:24.328
<i>Let's see if you got
the nads, kid.</i>

26:34.006 --> 26:35.472
Well, I guess
that would be a no,

26:35.474 --> 26:36.440
definitely a no.

27:07.473 --> 27:10.207
<i>Let's do it like dogs.</i>

27:27.994 --> 27:30.895
Marking your territory, kid?

27:48.147 --> 27:49.346
Come on, Sam. Go!

27:49.348 --> 27:50.380
<i>Drive!</i>

27:56.088 --> 27:57.121
Drive, Sam, drive!

27:57.123 --> 27:58.055
I am!

28:22.414 --> 28:23.814
Could it be the same animal

28:23.816 --> 28:26.016
that killed a couple
of hikers in this area

28:26.018 --> 28:27.451
<i>a few years ago?</i>

28:27.453 --> 28:31.588
<i>It's early to tell, similar.</i>

28:31.590 --> 28:32.923
Thank you so much,
Sheriff.

28:32.925 --> 28:35.359
That was Sheriff Joe Ruben,
who has confirmed

28:35.361 --> 28:38.062
that four university students
were killed

28:38.064 --> 28:40.865
by a large animal
in the mountains outside Dalton.

28:40.867 --> 28:43.100
The victims' names
have not been released,

28:43.102 --> 28:44.801
but the survivors
have been identified

28:44.803 --> 28:47.804
as Derek Cowley
and Samantha Marche.

28:47.806 --> 28:50.207
<i>They're scheduled
to be released later today.</i>

28:50.209 --> 28:55.212
<i>Reporting live from Dalton,
back to you at the studio.</i>

28:59.551 --> 29:00.985
Oh, Derek.

29:00.987 --> 29:02.452
Oh, my God.

29:02.454 --> 29:03.988
Are you okay?

29:03.990 --> 29:06.490
He's free to go.

29:07.726 --> 29:10.494
What--what did he
tell you he saw?

29:10.496 --> 29:12.229
Not much.

29:12.231 --> 29:14.365
He and the girl said
much the same thing.

29:14.367 --> 29:17.067
It was a large animal,
too dark to see.

29:17.069 --> 29:18.903
<i>To be honest,</i>

29:18.905 --> 29:23.073
well, I think they were
holding something back.

29:23.075 --> 29:25.042
<i>Where's she?</i>

29:25.044 --> 29:27.278
Well, the girl's
already released.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.180
Look, any information
you can get from your son

29:30.182 --> 29:31.348
sure would be helpful.

29:31.350 --> 29:32.349
Hmm.

29:39.058 --> 29:40.757
Derek.

29:40.759 --> 29:43.527
Is there anything else
you can tell the sheriff

29:43.529 --> 29:44.761
about what you saw?

29:50.036 --> 29:51.802
Okay.

29:51.804 --> 29:52.970
We're out of here.
Come on.

29:52.972 --> 29:54.371
<i>You might want to leave</i>

29:54.373 --> 29:55.472
the back way.

29:55.474 --> 29:58.008
There's reporters out front.

30:38.684 --> 30:40.284
Are you okay?
I've been calling you.

30:40.286 --> 30:42.919
I guess I missed you
at the station.

30:42.921 --> 30:44.388
Yeah, well,
I had somebody from work

30:44.390 --> 30:45.856
come pick me up.

30:45.858 --> 30:48.058
I didn't want to spoil
your little family reunion.

30:49.761 --> 30:53.364
Look, we need to talk...
in private.

30:57.569 --> 30:59.303
Where's your step-dad?

30:59.305 --> 31:01.271
Working, I guess.

31:03.376 --> 31:06.176
He said it was
my fault, Sam,

31:06.178 --> 31:09.480
because I stole his key.

31:09.482 --> 31:11.382
No, Derek,
it wasn't your fault.

31:11.384 --> 31:12.416
I don't know, Sam.

31:12.418 --> 31:13.517
No.

31:13.519 --> 31:14.818
You didn't kill them.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.920
We saw what killed them.

31:16.922 --> 31:19.756
And it wasn't a bear
or an escaped lion

31:19.758 --> 31:22.359
or any other kind
of animal.

31:22.361 --> 31:26.230
It was a werewolf.

31:28.867 --> 31:31.035
No, Sam.

31:31.037 --> 31:32.903
That's impossible.

31:32.905 --> 31:34.538
It was a full moon.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.974
It was walking on two legs
and wearing pants.

31:37.976 --> 31:41.311
Oh, and it was
fucking talking to us.

31:41.313 --> 31:43.013
What the hell else
could it have been?

31:43.015 --> 31:46.150
The question isn't
what it is.

31:46.152 --> 31:48.419
It's who it is.

31:48.421 --> 31:49.953
Who do you think it was?

31:49.955 --> 31:51.522
Whose cabin was it?

31:51.524 --> 31:53.157
He was on
a business trip, Sam.

31:53.159 --> 31:54.491
Oh, really?

31:54.493 --> 31:56.927
I think I saw his car there.

31:56.929 --> 32:00.097
Look, I live
with the guy, okay?

32:00.099 --> 32:02.266
Yes, he may be
an utter asshole,

32:02.268 --> 32:03.534
but I think I would know

32:03.536 --> 32:05.335
if he sprouted hair and fangs
every full moon.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.937
Why don't you check
his appointment book

32:06.939 --> 32:08.305
or something,
see where he's been

32:08.307 --> 32:10.006
the past couple full moons?

32:10.008 --> 32:13.043
Better yet,
check his back.

32:13.045 --> 32:14.644
I drove that ax in
pretty deep,

32:14.646 --> 32:15.879
and if it was him,

32:15.881 --> 32:18.048
he'd have
a pretty big flesh wound.

32:18.050 --> 32:19.716
Well, how do you suppose
I'd go about that?

32:19.718 --> 32:22.752
He hasn't exactly paraded around
the house shirtless or anything.

32:22.754 --> 32:24.254
Not even when he showers?

32:24.256 --> 32:26.856
I don't shower with him.

32:26.858 --> 32:27.958
I don't know,

32:27.960 --> 32:30.794
but maybe he sleeps
shirtless, you know?

32:30.796 --> 32:32.262
There you go.

32:32.264 --> 32:35.265
Let's just think about this
for one second, though, okay?

32:35.267 --> 32:37.767
Let's say we prove it,
we're right.

32:37.769 --> 32:39.403
Then what?

32:39.405 --> 32:41.004
I mean, we can't exactly go
to the police.

32:41.006 --> 32:42.872
They'll never believe us.

32:42.874 --> 32:44.941
Well, then it's up to us
to stop him.

32:44.943 --> 32:46.610
<i>I have a feeling
the next time,</i>

32:46.612 --> 32:49.679
it's going to be us.

35:23.302 --> 35:25.369
<i>Hey, hi, you guys.</i>

35:25.371 --> 35:28.305
It's Charlie.

35:28.307 --> 35:30.974
Sorry it's been so long.

35:30.976 --> 35:33.243
<i>I think about you guys
a lot, though.</i>

35:33.245 --> 35:34.544
<i>Listen.</i>

35:34.546 --> 35:36.280
I saw on the news
what happened at the cabin.

35:36.282 --> 35:38.448
I just wanted to know
that Derek was okay.

35:38.450 --> 35:42.218
<i>Gwen, could you give me
a call back, please,</i>

35:42.220 --> 35:45.489
just to let me know
how he's doing, huh?

35:45.491 --> 35:48.392
I miss you guys.

35:49.895 --> 35:50.960
Miss you too.

36:00.038 --> 36:01.371
<i>...gun under his pillow.</i>

36:01.373 --> 36:02.372
<i>What?</i>

36:02.374 --> 36:03.473
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:03.475 --> 36:04.675
<i>And just when I was,
you know,</i>

36:04.677 --> 36:06.142
<i>getting close
to seeing something,</i>

36:06.144 --> 36:08.278
<i>he woke up, and I barely
got out of there</i>

36:08.280 --> 36:09.646
<i>without being caught.</i>

36:09.648 --> 36:11.848
Wait, so you didn't even get
a glimpse at his back,

36:11.850 --> 36:13.417
not even on the tape?

36:13.419 --> 36:15.452
No, I told you
it wasn't taping.

36:15.454 --> 36:18.121
I just used the camera
for its night vision thing.

36:18.123 --> 36:20.156
Well, then we're back
at square one.

36:20.158 --> 36:21.891
Pretty much.

36:27.433 --> 36:29.366
I have an idea.

36:29.368 --> 36:31.301
Wait here.

36:31.303 --> 36:33.203
What are you doing?

36:35.207 --> 36:36.473
Wow.

36:36.475 --> 36:39.042
That's a shitload
of weight, Mr. Toblat.

36:39.044 --> 36:41.044
Do you mind
if I call you "Mitch"?

36:45.050 --> 36:48.685
Call me Mitchell.

36:48.687 --> 36:51.187
Mitchell.
I like that.

36:51.189 --> 36:54.391
Rolls off the tongue
nice and strong.

36:54.393 --> 36:56.326
Do you mind
if I do a set?

36:56.328 --> 36:58.328
You lift weights?

36:58.330 --> 36:59.329
Hell, yeah.

36:59.331 --> 37:02.833
Not as much as you.

37:03.902 --> 37:06.302
I usually ask Derek
to lift with me.

37:06.304 --> 37:07.371
He's not that interested.

37:07.373 --> 37:08.405
Can you get that in?

37:08.407 --> 37:09.639
She's going
to lift weights.

37:09.641 --> 37:12.141
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:12.143 --> 37:15.078
Derek's more brains
than brawn.

37:16.515 --> 37:18.849
I hope you know
what you're doing, Sam.

37:18.851 --> 37:21.084
Yeah.

37:21.086 --> 37:22.919
Move your hands in there.

37:22.921 --> 37:24.153
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:24.155 --> 37:25.689
Okay? All right?

37:26.725 --> 37:27.724
Got it?

37:27.726 --> 37:29.659
Yeah.

37:35.267 --> 37:36.733
Yeah.

37:36.735 --> 37:38.134
Impressive.

37:38.136 --> 37:39.536
Thank you.

37:39.538 --> 37:41.405
<i>Pretty strong there, girl.</i>

37:41.407 --> 37:42.806
Yeah.

37:42.808 --> 37:45.008
Well, I'm taking classes
to become a massage therapist,

37:45.010 --> 37:46.976
working on my arm strength.

37:46.978 --> 37:49.546
Let me try.

37:49.548 --> 37:50.947
Yeah?

37:50.949 --> 37:52.449
Oh, come on.
I need to practice.

37:54.119 --> 37:57.153
I won't hurt you.

38:00.759 --> 38:03.760
You know, I can't do this
through your shirt.

38:21.046 --> 38:22.546
Hey.

38:22.548 --> 38:25.081
What are you doing?

38:25.083 --> 38:26.883
What, did I hit
your funny bone or something?

38:26.885 --> 38:28.985
No, you stopped.

38:28.987 --> 38:30.787
Talk about ungrateful.

38:30.789 --> 38:34.023
See you later,
Mitchell.

38:51.543 --> 38:53.510
No.

39:11.096 --> 39:12.496
Damn it.

39:12.498 --> 39:14.130
What the hell was that?

39:14.132 --> 39:16.766
I mean, it wasn't
exactly subtle, Sam.

39:16.768 --> 39:18.869
There wasn't a mark
on him.

39:18.871 --> 39:21.638
Maybe it's because
he's not a werewolf.

39:21.640 --> 39:24.875
Maybe he has some kind
of mutant healing ability.

39:24.877 --> 39:25.909
I don't know.

39:25.911 --> 39:27.043
Yeah, and maybe he has

39:27.045 --> 39:29.513
a skeleton laced
with adamantium.

39:29.515 --> 39:30.881
Come on, Sam.

39:30.883 --> 39:32.749
What, you think
I'm crazy, huh?

39:32.751 --> 39:33.817
How do you explain it?

39:33.819 --> 39:34.851
I don't know.

39:34.853 --> 39:36.720
I'm just saying it--

39:36.722 --> 39:37.721
shit, here he comes.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.255
Look, let's talk
about it later.

39:39.257 --> 39:40.957
Not here, okay?
Fine.

39:40.959 --> 39:43.059
Hi, Sam.

39:43.061 --> 39:44.628
Bye, Sam.

39:44.630 --> 39:46.462
Hey, honey.

39:46.464 --> 39:48.064
Hey.
You need any help?

39:48.066 --> 39:49.065
<i>No, I don't.</i>

39:49.067 --> 39:50.033
Okay.

39:51.737 --> 39:52.836
Hey.

39:52.838 --> 39:54.804
<i>How was your workout?</i>

39:54.806 --> 39:57.240
<i>It was great.</i>

39:57.242 --> 39:58.942
It was a great workout,

39:58.944 --> 40:01.778
especially
the erotic rubdown I got

40:01.780 --> 40:03.713
from Derek's
slutty little girlfriend.

40:04.883 --> 40:06.082
What?

40:06.084 --> 40:08.084
Oh, yeah. He saw.
Ask him. Tell her.

40:08.086 --> 40:10.887
<i>She practically ripped
my shirt off.</i>

40:10.889 --> 40:16.560
She's quite a little
wildcat, huh?

40:18.263 --> 40:20.229
Are you drunk?

40:20.231 --> 40:21.565
No, I am not drunk.

40:21.567 --> 40:24.034
You should have seen the way
she was strutting

40:24.036 --> 40:25.334
<i>her little ass around.</i>

40:25.336 --> 40:27.070
You haven't tapped that yet,
have you?

40:27.072 --> 40:28.204
<i>Okay.</i>

40:28.206 --> 40:30.073
That's enough.

40:30.075 --> 40:32.943
I won't have that kind of talk
in my home.

40:32.945 --> 40:34.310
Just for your information,

40:34.312 --> 40:36.379
this is my goddamn house,

40:36.381 --> 40:38.882
and I'll say
whatever I want.

40:38.884 --> 40:40.717
You liar.

40:40.719 --> 40:41.751
You're drunk.

40:41.753 --> 40:43.053
<i>I'm not drunk.</i>

40:43.055 --> 40:44.955
Stop it.
Leave her alone.

40:47.525 --> 40:51.494
Oh, "stop it"?
"Leave her alone"?

40:53.198 --> 40:55.398
You going to make me?

40:59.605 --> 41:02.271
Nah, guess not.

41:02.273 --> 41:05.441
Nice.

41:06.912 --> 41:10.046
Oh, goddamn it.
Now look what you done.

41:10.048 --> 41:11.014
Honey?

41:50.922 --> 41:53.356
Mom?

41:55.493 --> 41:57.426
Mom?

42:46.978 --> 42:48.544
Charlie.

42:48.546 --> 42:50.413
Oh, my God.

42:51.717 --> 42:53.983
This is a surprise.

42:55.553 --> 42:57.320
I'm sorry
to just drop in,

42:57.322 --> 42:58.654
but I left a couple messages

42:58.656 --> 43:01.324
after I heard about
the incident with Derek.

43:01.326 --> 43:04.027
I didn't get any messages.

43:04.029 --> 43:06.196
Ah.

43:06.198 --> 43:07.496
I'm sorry.

43:07.498 --> 43:09.599
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

43:09.601 --> 43:10.633
You're here.

43:10.635 --> 43:11.901
Come in, please.

43:17.475 --> 43:18.742
Derek!

43:18.744 --> 43:21.211
Look who's here.

43:21.213 --> 43:24.413
Oh, I--I wish I knew
you were coming.

43:24.415 --> 43:25.448
No, no, no, no.

43:25.450 --> 43:29.819
You look beautiful,
like always.

43:29.821 --> 43:32.655
Uncle Charlie?

43:34.059 --> 43:35.959
Derek.

43:35.961 --> 43:37.426
I'm glad you're okay.

43:37.428 --> 43:41.231
Look, I saw what happened
on the--on the news.

43:41.233 --> 43:43.266
I'm really sorry
about your friends.

43:44.369 --> 43:46.702
My God, Gwen.

43:46.704 --> 43:48.037
He looks so much
like his father.

43:48.039 --> 43:50.173
It's amazing.

43:50.175 --> 43:53.143
Come on;
I'll make coffee.

43:53.145 --> 43:54.677
Oh, it's been
way too long.

43:54.679 --> 43:56.246
Come on.

43:56.248 --> 43:58.081
<i>And that was the first
and last time</i>

43:58.083 --> 43:59.382
<i>I ever changed a diaper.</i>

43:59.384 --> 44:01.184
<i>Man, I couldn't believe
how much crap came out</i>

44:01.186 --> 44:02.385
<i>of somebody so small.</i>

44:02.387 --> 44:03.519
And the next thing you know,

44:03.521 --> 44:04.720
it's all over you and me
and the table.

44:04.722 --> 44:06.455
That's disgusting.

44:06.457 --> 44:08.091
I swear to God he was laughing
his ass off at me.

44:08.093 --> 44:09.092
<i>I was.</i>

44:09.094 --> 44:10.293
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:10.295 --> 44:11.961
Back then,
your uncle wasn't exactly

44:11.963 --> 44:15.031
at the top
of our baby-sitting list.

44:15.033 --> 44:16.565
He was--

44:16.567 --> 44:18.234
<i>a big bachelor.</i>

44:18.236 --> 44:20.103
So you never had kids?

44:21.139 --> 44:23.306
Never even
got married.

44:23.308 --> 44:26.475
'Cause after your dad nabbed
the best girl out there,

44:26.477 --> 44:28.778
it didn't make much sense
to bother.

44:28.780 --> 44:30.346
Charlie.

44:30.348 --> 44:31.380
Now look at you.

44:31.382 --> 44:32.548
You're all grown up.

44:32.550 --> 44:33.983
What are you,
like, 6'5"?

44:33.985 --> 44:35.885
You know,
if your father was here--

44:35.887 --> 44:39.289
Well, he's not here.

44:39.291 --> 44:42.391
Mitch.

44:42.393 --> 44:44.260
You surprised us.

44:44.262 --> 44:45.761
I'm a little surprised too.

44:45.763 --> 44:46.896
Hey, Mitch.

44:46.898 --> 44:49.999
Sorry to just...
drop in.

44:50.001 --> 44:51.467
Look, I was in town
on business,

44:51.469 --> 44:53.102
<i>and I just wanted
to make sure</i>

44:53.104 --> 44:54.137
that Derek was okay.

44:54.139 --> 44:56.105
Well, as you can see,
he's fine.

44:56.107 --> 44:57.606
So he is.

44:57.608 --> 44:59.608
Look, I better be going.

44:59.610 --> 45:02.245
Oh, you can't stay?

45:02.247 --> 45:03.913
No, no.
Business calls.

45:03.915 --> 45:06.149
Look, it was great
to see you again, Gwen.

45:06.151 --> 45:09.152
Yeah, you too.

45:09.154 --> 45:10.553
Take care.

45:10.555 --> 45:12.288
You want
to walk me out, Derek?

45:12.290 --> 45:14.490
Yeah, sure.

45:21.733 --> 45:23.099
It's good to see you
again, Derek.

45:23.101 --> 45:24.968
It was really nice.

45:27.205 --> 45:29.138
Hey, did I show you
this new PDA?

45:29.140 --> 45:30.473
No.

45:30.475 --> 45:35.578
Yeah, it's amazing
what they can do now, huh?

45:35.580 --> 45:37.513
Cool, huh?

45:42.553 --> 45:44.820
Yeah, it's cool.

45:44.822 --> 45:47.056
Yeah.

45:47.058 --> 45:48.524
You take care.

45:48.526 --> 45:50.894
You too.

45:59.905 --> 46:01.504
<i>We're here with Derek Cowley,</i>

46:01.506 --> 46:04.340
one of the only two survivors
of the Friday night massacre.

46:04.342 --> 46:06.075
Derek, can you tell us
what happened?

46:06.077 --> 46:07.076
Who are you guys?

46:07.078 --> 46:08.177
Name's Nick Baxter.

46:08.179 --> 46:09.745
I'm a J-school student
making a tribute

46:09.747 --> 46:11.447
to the innocent students
that were killed.

46:11.449 --> 46:13.016
Can you tell us more
about how they died?

46:13.018 --> 46:14.083
What kind of animal
was it?

46:14.085 --> 46:15.285
No, I don't know.

46:15.287 --> 46:16.685
We're not
granting interviews.

46:16.687 --> 46:18.187
I'm a classmate
of Derek's.

46:18.189 --> 46:19.889
I was just hoping
to get a few minutes.

46:19.891 --> 46:21.357
Get off my property now.

46:21.359 --> 46:22.392
Okay.
Come on, guys.

46:22.394 --> 46:23.492
We'll just
ambush him later.

46:23.494 --> 46:24.427
No!

46:38.676 --> 46:39.775
Hi.

46:39.777 --> 46:40.776
You must be Sam.

46:40.778 --> 46:42.211
How you doing?
I'm Charlie.

46:42.213 --> 46:44.080
Come on in.

46:44.082 --> 46:45.448
You guys are soaking.

46:45.450 --> 46:47.383
Uh, Sam here
rides a bike...

46:47.385 --> 46:48.584
in the rain.

46:48.586 --> 46:50.719
Huh. Cool.

46:50.721 --> 46:52.956
Look, I don't want
to be rude here,

46:52.958 --> 46:54.324
but what are we doing?

46:54.326 --> 46:56.525
Usually when guys invite teens
into their hotel rooms,

46:56.527 --> 46:58.962
it's the start
of bad internet porn.

47:00.065 --> 47:01.897
Look, uh,
please.

47:01.899 --> 47:03.666
I invited
you guys here to--

47:03.668 --> 47:05.301
please have a seat--

47:05.303 --> 47:09.405
to talk about what happened
at the cabin.

47:09.407 --> 47:11.540
<i>I want you to tell me
what you saw.</i>

47:11.542 --> 47:12.875
Look, we already told
the police.

47:12.877 --> 47:13.909
Yeah, I know--

47:13.911 --> 47:15.311
what you thought
they would accept

47:15.313 --> 47:17.113
but not the truth.

47:17.115 --> 47:19.048
<i>Derek.</i>

47:19.050 --> 47:20.116
What did they tell you

47:20.118 --> 47:22.418
about how your father
was killed?

47:22.420 --> 47:25.288
Uh, that it was
a hunting accident

47:25.290 --> 47:26.322
seven years ago.

47:26.324 --> 47:28.657
<i>I mean,</i>

47:28.659 --> 47:29.925
I asked more,

47:29.927 --> 47:31.394
and they never
gave me anything--

47:31.396 --> 47:33.262
just, you know,
a vague answer,

47:33.264 --> 47:35.965
<i>or they'd change
the subject completely.</i>

47:35.967 --> 47:39.068
Why?
Do you know something?

47:39.070 --> 47:43.206
I know it was
no hunting accident.

47:43.208 --> 47:45.941
I saw him die, Derek.

47:45.943 --> 47:47.810
<i>I saw that... thing</i>

47:47.812 --> 47:49.312
kill him.

47:49.314 --> 47:51.680
And I think it's the same thing
that killed your classmates.

47:51.682 --> 47:54.250
I don't understand.

47:54.252 --> 47:55.251
I mean, how--

47:55.253 --> 47:56.352
<i>Listen.</i>

47:56.354 --> 48:00.789
Your dad and Mitch
were friends once,

48:00.791 --> 48:02.525
and they were on
this safari in Africa.

48:02.527 --> 48:03.959
Mitch was a big hunter.

48:03.961 --> 48:06.129
<i>And your dad convinced Mitch
to let me tag along.</i>

48:06.131 --> 48:12.368
And we went out, and, uh...

48:12.370 --> 48:14.637
I got separated

48:14.639 --> 48:15.671
<i>in the brush.</i>

48:15.673 --> 48:16.939
<i>And...</i>

48:16.941 --> 48:22.511
I heard this ungodly roar.

48:23.982 --> 48:26.816
And then I heard screaming.

48:26.818 --> 48:31.220
And I knew it was Scott.

48:31.222 --> 48:33.790
When I got to him,

48:33.792 --> 48:35.825
<i>that thing,</i>

48:35.827 --> 48:39.261
that creature was...

48:39.263 --> 48:42.565
ripping your father apart.

48:44.368 --> 48:45.601
<i>It turned on me,</i>

48:45.603 --> 48:47.170
and I fired my gun,

48:47.172 --> 48:50.439
and I got him in the shoulder.

48:50.441 --> 48:52.742
And this thing howled
and took off in the brush,

48:52.744 --> 48:59.481
and by the time I got back
to your dad,

48:59.483 --> 49:00.917
he was already dead.

49:00.919 --> 49:04.020
<i>When I got back
to the camp,</i>

49:04.022 --> 49:05.454
Mitch wasn't there.

49:05.456 --> 49:10.026
I mean, he was gone for hours,
claimed that he got lost.

49:10.028 --> 49:14.430
But he had a wound
where I shot the creature.

49:14.432 --> 49:17.734
And the next morning,
it was completely healed.

49:19.537 --> 49:22.972
But...

49:22.974 --> 49:26.575
everything I saw,
despite everything I saw,

49:26.577 --> 49:27.643
I did nothing.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.947
But I'm not going
to make that mistake,

49:30.949 --> 49:32.248
not again.

49:32.250 --> 49:35.218
Toblat killed your father
and your classmates

49:35.220 --> 49:38.020
and God knows who else,
and he's got to be stopped.

49:38.022 --> 49:39.255
I think I'm going to be sick.

49:39.257 --> 49:40.556
That's it.

49:40.558 --> 49:42.759
Let's kill the sick bastard.

49:42.761 --> 49:44.627
Derek?

49:44.629 --> 49:47.029
Derek, are you with us?

49:47.031 --> 49:49.132
I, uh...

49:49.134 --> 49:50.366
don't know about that, Sam.

49:50.368 --> 49:52.201
Your step-dad killed
those people!

49:52.203 --> 49:55.204
What don't you know?

49:55.206 --> 49:58.207
You're talking
about murder, Sam.

49:58.209 --> 50:00.309
Damn straight.

50:00.311 --> 50:02.278
But none of us
has seen him change.

50:02.280 --> 50:03.880
<i>I mean, we don't have
a shred of hard evidence.</i>

50:03.882 --> 50:05.481
Do you realize that?

50:05.483 --> 50:07.083
Wait a second.
Derek's right.

50:07.085 --> 50:09.051
If we're going to be judge,
jury, and executioner,

50:09.053 --> 50:10.887
we have to be
absolutely certain.

50:10.889 --> 50:13.422
What, we just wait
till he kills again?

50:13.424 --> 50:15.258
No, no, I got a better idea.

50:15.260 --> 50:17.827
My company installed
some software at this DNA lab.

50:17.829 --> 50:19.461
<i>I know the guy
that runs it.</i>

50:19.463 --> 50:22.765
We could send in a sample
and have it analyzed.

50:22.767 --> 50:24.167
I mean, it only makes sense

50:24.169 --> 50:26.102
that it's some sort
of genetic mutation, right?

50:26.104 --> 50:27.369
What kind of sample?

50:27.371 --> 50:29.105
Uh, we could get some hair.

50:29.107 --> 50:30.239
I could call and see

50:30.241 --> 50:31.908
how many pieces of hair
we need for that.

50:31.910 --> 50:33.776
You could let me know,
and I could, I don't know,

50:33.778 --> 50:35.477
get some off of his pillow
or something.

50:38.349 --> 50:41.083
Okay, I'll help.

50:41.085 --> 50:42.685
All right, then.

50:42.687 --> 50:44.320
You get me the sample.

50:44.322 --> 50:45.354
<i>I'll expedite</i>

50:45.356 --> 50:47.356
the report.

50:47.358 --> 50:48.991
<i>And if it confirms
our suspicions,</i>

50:48.993 --> 50:52.494
we kill him.

50:59.270 --> 51:00.837
Hurry up; he just ran
to the post office.

51:00.839 --> 51:02.038
Okay, you keep
a look out.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.572
I'm going to go
check out the bathroom.

51:03.574 --> 51:05.141
Hey, just remember,
we need ten strands

51:05.143 --> 51:06.408
with the roots
still attached.

51:06.410 --> 51:07.776
No shit, Sherlock.

51:29.400 --> 51:30.399
Hey, time's up.
He's here.

51:32.636 --> 51:34.036
Come on, Sam.
Just forget it.

51:34.038 --> 51:35.371
Stall him.

51:35.373 --> 51:36.906
Damn it, Sam.

51:36.908 --> 51:39.075
Oh, come on.

51:41.512 --> 51:42.811
Mitch.

51:42.813 --> 51:44.013
Hey, what are you doing?

51:44.015 --> 51:45.848
I'm working.
Can you excuse me?

51:45.850 --> 51:48.284
Uh, sure.

51:59.397 --> 52:00.329
Shit.

52:09.774 --> 52:10.839
What are you doing?

52:10.841 --> 52:13.442
I'm just
looking around.

52:13.444 --> 52:16.612
In here, my bedroom?
Why?

52:16.614 --> 52:18.881
Something I can do
for you?

52:18.883 --> 52:19.949
Uh, no.

52:19.951 --> 52:21.550
I--it was just
a mistake.

52:21.552 --> 52:24.686
I'm just going to--
Oh, no.

52:24.688 --> 52:26.455
Let me go.

52:26.457 --> 52:28.958
No, I've been
watching you,

52:28.960 --> 52:30.659
the way you strut.

52:30.661 --> 52:34.630
I know what you want.

52:36.234 --> 52:38.834
You don't have
to force me.

52:38.836 --> 52:41.237
I'm not
an unwilling subject,

52:41.239 --> 52:43.072
if you know
what I mean.

52:43.074 --> 52:44.640
I know what you mean.

52:44.642 --> 52:46.909
I'm right here.

52:46.911 --> 52:49.312
What's stopping you?

52:49.314 --> 52:51.247
You startled me.

52:51.249 --> 52:53.449
I lost my nerve.

52:53.451 --> 52:58.187
But if you let me go,
I'll show you.

53:13.838 --> 53:15.804
You like it rough.

53:15.806 --> 53:17.473
Yeah.

53:22.213 --> 53:23.779
You know what?

53:23.781 --> 53:25.647
Derek's downstairs.

53:25.649 --> 53:28.484
I doubt that we can
do this properly,

53:28.486 --> 53:30.519
so why don't we
finish this up later, okay?

53:30.521 --> 53:32.688
No, not later.

53:32.690 --> 53:34.957
Right now.

53:34.959 --> 53:37.626
Now.

53:58.582 --> 53:59.615
Are you okay?

53:59.617 --> 54:00.616
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:00.618 --> 54:01.683
Did he see you?

54:01.685 --> 54:03.285
Sam?

54:06.790 --> 54:08.690
Got the sample.
Gotta go.

54:21.772 --> 54:23.039
Hey, Sam.

54:27.678 --> 54:30.479
Please don't
tell Derek, okay?

54:50.667 --> 54:51.767
Hey, Charlie.

54:51.769 --> 54:52.768
Hey.

54:52.770 --> 54:53.769
Sorry I'm late.

54:53.771 --> 54:55.170
I had to get some stuff
from school.

54:55.172 --> 54:56.238
Yeah, don't worry about it.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.239
Where's Sam?

54:57.241 --> 54:58.340
I thought she'd be
with you.

54:58.342 --> 54:59.742
No, actually.

54:59.744 --> 55:03.212
She hasn't been returning
any of my calls lately.

55:03.214 --> 55:04.579
You think
something's wrong?

55:04.581 --> 55:07.382
No, but I just kind of feel

55:07.384 --> 55:09.017
like she's ignoring me,
you know?

55:09.019 --> 55:12.387
I just--I don't
get her sometimes.

55:12.389 --> 55:15.390
Huh.

55:15.392 --> 55:18.627
You like her, don't you?

55:18.629 --> 55:20.629
Is it that obvious?

55:21.932 --> 55:23.632
You never made a move?

55:23.634 --> 55:24.967
No.

55:24.969 --> 55:27.269
Maybe she feels the same.

55:27.271 --> 55:29.938
How do you know
unless you try?

55:29.940 --> 55:33.375
Trust me; I speak
from experience here.

55:33.377 --> 55:35.944
I had a chance once
with a very special lady,

55:35.946 --> 55:37.045
but I didn't act.

55:37.047 --> 55:38.413
I didn't tell her
how I felt.

55:38.415 --> 55:40.215
And the moment passed.

55:40.217 --> 55:42.550
Biggest mistake of my life.

55:42.552 --> 55:43.652
Well, that and staying away

55:43.654 --> 55:44.987
from you and your mom
for so long.

55:44.989 --> 55:46.421
So why did you?

55:46.423 --> 55:48.957
You know,
when your dad was killed,

55:48.959 --> 55:52.928
Mitch was pretty persistent
in wooing your mom.

55:52.930 --> 55:54.729
And I tried to warn her
in every way possible

55:54.731 --> 55:56.098
not to marry that man.

55:56.100 --> 56:00.869
But I couldn't tell her why,
what I suspected.

56:00.871 --> 56:02.370
Toblat knew
I didn't like him,

56:02.372 --> 56:04.773
and after they were married,
he did everything he could

56:04.775 --> 56:06.741
to keep me
from seeing you two.

56:06.743 --> 56:11.413
<i>Speaking of, the DNA analysis
of the sample that Sam got</i>

56:11.415 --> 56:12.447
<i>will arrive tomorrow</i>

56:12.449 --> 56:13.615
at my hotel by courier.

56:13.617 --> 56:14.582
<i>Really?
Yeah.</i>

56:16.887 --> 56:22.324
Bitch, she blew me
and used it to--

56:37.141 --> 56:39.274
Stupid--

56:48.618 --> 56:51.419
Okay.

56:51.421 --> 56:54.890
Later.

56:54.892 --> 56:58.927
A little later.

56:58.929 --> 57:00.762
Yeah.

57:00.764 --> 57:02.597
Very soon.

57:06.203 --> 57:08.536
<i>Clang!</i>

57:17.248 --> 57:18.613
Holy shit, Sam.

57:18.615 --> 57:21.216
Why the hell
are you sneaking around?

57:21.218 --> 57:22.918
I could have bashed
your brains in.

57:22.920 --> 57:24.186
Why the hell

57:24.188 --> 57:26.088
aren't you answering
any of my phone calls?

57:26.090 --> 57:27.856
I mean, do you realize
the last time I saw you,

57:27.858 --> 57:30.558
you literally ran
out of my house?

57:30.560 --> 57:32.327
I mean,
the least you could do

57:32.329 --> 57:33.996
is let me know
that you're okay, Sam.

57:33.998 --> 57:36.331
I'm fine.

57:36.333 --> 57:38.433
If you're just going
to stand there,

57:38.435 --> 57:39.601
you can help me.

57:39.603 --> 57:42.771
Hold this.

57:46.543 --> 57:49.611
Hey, uh...

57:49.613 --> 57:53.515
why do you think we never
hooked up in high school?

57:53.517 --> 57:57.652
You didn't treat me
like shit.

57:57.654 --> 58:01.089
You were too nice.

58:01.091 --> 58:03.959
Oh, a nice guy.

58:03.961 --> 58:05.860
It's the kiss of death,
you know?

58:05.862 --> 58:09.898
Happens to be
the story of my life.

58:11.936 --> 58:14.436
You know what kind
of girl I am.

58:14.438 --> 58:15.703
I don't care.

58:15.705 --> 58:19.607
I never did;
you know that.

58:24.048 --> 58:25.513
Clang!

58:25.515 --> 58:26.982
Oh.
Are you okay?

58:26.984 --> 58:28.850
Uh, I--great.

58:28.852 --> 58:32.487
Let--oh, yuck,
grease, sorry.

58:42.032 --> 58:43.031
What, what?

58:43.033 --> 58:44.632
Did I do something wrong?

58:44.634 --> 58:45.767
Was--

58:45.769 --> 58:47.802
No, I--

58:47.804 --> 58:50.272
I need
to tell you something,

58:50.274 --> 58:52.574
and I'm just afraid
that when I tell you,

58:52.576 --> 58:55.910
you're not going to want
to do that again.

58:55.912 --> 58:57.879
No, tell me.
I don't care.

58:57.881 --> 59:04.019
No, you have to hear this.

59:04.021 --> 59:05.354
The other day
at your house--

59:05.356 --> 59:07.389
Derek and Samantha,
what are you hiding?

59:07.391 --> 59:09.657
It's becoming obvious you know
more than what you told.

59:09.659 --> 59:10.792
Who the hell are you?

59:10.794 --> 59:12.727
Get the fuck out of here.

59:12.729 --> 59:14.762
Why did the two of you survive
and the others die?

59:14.764 --> 59:16.764
Okay, you know,
you get out of here, okay?

59:16.766 --> 59:18.633
I'll take care of them.
I'll call you tomorrow.

59:18.635 --> 59:20.402
<i>See, see, Cowley's</i>

59:20.404 --> 59:21.403
ducking us again.

59:21.405 --> 59:22.471
Come on, Samantha.

59:22.473 --> 59:24.072
Just tell us.
Why?

59:24.074 --> 59:26.408
You want to know
what the better question is?

59:26.410 --> 59:28.443
Why am I going to kick
all of your asses?

59:28.445 --> 59:30.412
Anybody?

59:30.414 --> 59:32.414
Why?

59:32.416 --> 59:34.649
Because nobody calls me
"Samantha",

59:34.651 --> 59:36.751
you blood-sucking leech.

59:36.753 --> 59:38.920
The garage is closed.

59:38.922 --> 59:41.490
So get your pimply asses out
of it.

59:41.492 --> 59:44.092
Now!

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.678
Package for Charles Cowley.

01:00:05.882 --> 01:00:08.517
There is a courier here
at the front desk

01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:11.553
<i>with an envelope that you need
to sign for personally.</i>

01:00:11.555 --> 01:00:13.788
He'll be right down.

01:00:25.802 --> 01:00:28.803
Hey, you got a package
for me?

01:00:28.805 --> 01:00:29.971
Charles Cowley?

01:00:29.973 --> 01:00:32.040
Right.

01:00:44.354 --> 01:00:47.922
Hey, you have something
for Charlie Cowley?

01:00:47.924 --> 01:00:50.492
No.

01:00:50.494 --> 01:00:51.726
That guy signed for it.

01:01:35.406 --> 01:01:37.673
<i>Yes, it's a warehouse.</i>

01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:40.208
Right, 20,000 square feet.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:42.911
<i>All right?</i>

01:01:42.913 --> 01:01:45.980
Yeah.

01:01:45.982 --> 01:01:46.981
<i>All right.</i>

01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:48.082
<i>Look, let's meet.</i>

01:02:34.765 --> 01:02:40.635
<i>You just couldn't leave it
alone, could you, Charlie?</i>

01:02:40.637 --> 01:02:47.642
<i>Saw the news report,
had to come see for yourself.</i>

01:02:47.644 --> 01:02:50.345
<i>Derek and his little slut
girlfriend,</i>

01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:54.716
<i>oh, they would have dropped it
and gone.</i>

01:02:54.718 --> 01:02:57.719
<i>Now...</i>

01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:00.255
they're going to die,

01:03:00.257 --> 01:03:03.258
just like you,
Charlie.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.126
They don't know anything.

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:06.428
They haven't seen
the report.

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:08.363
They will, eventually.

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:11.132
You know it.

01:03:11.134 --> 01:03:12.701
Please.

01:03:12.703 --> 01:03:13.802
Please don't do this.

01:03:13.804 --> 01:03:15.203
Can't we work
something out?

01:03:15.205 --> 01:03:18.707
You know, I don't think we can
work something out, Charlie.

01:03:18.709 --> 01:03:20.742
<i>One of the first things
I learned</i>

01:03:20.744 --> 01:03:23.011
when I was infected

01:03:23.013 --> 01:03:27.315
was that on a full moon,
I was compelled to change.

01:03:27.317 --> 01:03:29.384
Needed to, wanted to.

01:03:29.386 --> 01:03:31.386
<i>But on the other nights,</i>

01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:33.388
I felt the urge,
especially when I was hungry

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:37.759
or tired
or just a little too horny.

01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:40.829
But I could resist it.

01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:43.064
But the one thing
that got me, Charlie,

01:03:43.066 --> 01:03:45.667
was stress.

01:03:45.669 --> 01:03:49.604
It's your fault that this
has happened to me, Charlie.

01:03:49.606 --> 01:03:51.673
What about Scott?

01:03:51.675 --> 01:03:53.174
Who made you do that?

01:03:53.176 --> 01:03:56.511
Don't act like you weren't
relieved when he died.

01:03:56.513 --> 01:04:00.381
You felt the same way
about Gwen as I did.

01:04:00.383 --> 01:04:02.818
No, you're wrong.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.954
She was my brother's wife,
you sick fuck.

01:04:05.956 --> 01:04:08.022
<i>I would never</i>

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:09.123
touch her.

01:04:13.464 --> 01:04:15.530
'Cause she was a great fuck.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.209
<i>Look how pathetic you are,
Charlie.</i>

01:05:05.215 --> 01:05:09.217
<i>Soft and slow and weak.</i>

01:05:12.155 --> 01:05:14.188
<i>Just remember, Charlie.</i>

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:18.560
<i>All your fault.</i>

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:23.598
Because you had to open
your big mouth.

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.477
<i>Night, Sam.
See you tomorrow.</i>

01:05:36.479 --> 01:05:38.747
Hey, are you--
are you done for the day?

01:05:38.749 --> 01:05:40.015
Yeah,
I just wrapped up.

01:05:40.017 --> 01:05:41.349
You want a beer?

01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:42.784
Sure.

01:05:49.726 --> 01:05:51.225
<i>What's that?</i>

01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:52.961
Mom's crap.

01:05:52.963 --> 01:05:55.630
It was put into storage
after she killed herself.

01:05:55.632 --> 01:05:56.965
<i>There's no money</i>

01:05:56.967 --> 01:05:58.299
to keep it there anymore.

01:05:58.301 --> 01:05:59.534
I'd try to get my dad
to take it,

01:05:59.536 --> 01:06:01.670
since most of it's his shit,

01:06:01.672 --> 01:06:04.539
but I don't even know where
to look for the asshole.

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:07.208
So have you heard
from your uncle yet?

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:09.578
No, I mean,
he should have called by now,

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.079
but he hasn't.

01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:12.914
Hold on.

01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:14.716
I've got an email from him.

01:06:14.718 --> 01:06:17.118
Look, it's a photo,
but I can't make it out.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.521
It--hey, let's forward it
to your computer.

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:22.791
Come on.

01:06:29.099 --> 01:06:30.899
Oh, it's the report.

01:06:30.901 --> 01:06:32.734
Um, "test results show

01:06:32.736 --> 01:06:35.269
<i>"both human and animal genetic
material present,</i>

01:06:35.271 --> 01:06:36.337
probable canine."

01:06:36.339 --> 01:06:37.572
It's what we wanted.

01:06:37.574 --> 01:06:39.307
Yeah, yeah,
but one second.

01:06:45.415 --> 01:06:46.681
I don't get it.

01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:49.851
I mean, it--it has to be
a mistake, right?

01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:51.385
<i>I--</i>

01:06:51.387 --> 01:06:53.622
I tried to tell you.

01:07:00.697 --> 01:07:01.696
How could you, Sam?

01:07:01.698 --> 01:07:03.732
He cornered me.

01:07:03.734 --> 01:07:05.266
What else was I
supposed to do?

01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:06.567
Oh, so now you had
no other choice

01:07:06.569 --> 01:07:08.069
but to, I don't know,
suck his dick?

01:07:08.071 --> 01:07:09.437
Well, where were you, huh?

01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:11.339
I didn't see you exactly
breaking down the door.

01:07:15.078 --> 01:07:18.013
We know the truth
about him, okay?

01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:19.514
That's the important thing.

01:07:25.822 --> 01:07:27.122
So what?

01:07:27.124 --> 01:07:28.189
You got your feelings hurt.

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:29.858
Now you going to run home
to Mommy?

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.126
I'll take care of it,
okay?

01:07:31.128 --> 01:07:33.227
You shouldn't have
gotten involved

01:07:33.229 --> 01:07:35.530
in the first place;
it's a family matter.

01:07:35.532 --> 01:07:36.965
No, Derek.

01:07:36.967 --> 01:07:39.433
Don't face him alone, okay?

01:07:39.435 --> 01:07:41.469
You're going to need
my help.

01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:42.871
Your help?

01:07:42.873 --> 01:07:44.739
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:46.107
I'll give you a call

01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:47.542
if I need someone
to fuck him to death.

01:08:04.861 --> 01:08:07.461
Come on, Charlie.
Pick up.

01:08:55.245 --> 01:08:58.880
Dinner will be ready
in two minutes.

01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:01.381
I ate at the office.

01:09:01.384 --> 01:09:04.252
Have you been drinking
again?

01:09:04.254 --> 01:09:07.555
I need to take a shower.

01:09:07.557 --> 01:09:09.357
I'm sick of this, Mitch.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.024
You said you'd quit.
You promised.

01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:17.899
Good thing you didn't promise
to quit being a nagging bitch.

01:09:46.395 --> 01:09:48.296
Mom?

01:09:49.933 --> 01:09:51.532
Mom?

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.942
Dad's stuff.

01:10:00.944 --> 01:10:03.311
Derek.

01:10:03.313 --> 01:10:05.579
I am so sorry.

01:10:05.581 --> 01:10:07.581
For what?

01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:11.152
Everything.

01:10:11.154 --> 01:10:16.991
For taking his abuse
all these years.

01:10:16.993 --> 01:10:20.261
I just don't understand why--

01:10:20.263 --> 01:10:22.697
I'm leaving.

01:10:25.468 --> 01:10:26.835
We're leaving.

01:10:26.837 --> 01:10:28.203
<i>I just--</i>

01:10:31.407 --> 01:10:32.406
<i>I didn't want</i>

01:10:32.408 --> 01:10:34.742
to leave his things behind.

01:10:34.744 --> 01:10:36.677
Have you packed?

01:10:38.548 --> 01:10:40.681
Mitch is in the bedroom.

01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:42.183
It's okay.

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.219
It's okay;
you can pack tomorrow.

01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:46.520
We'll--we'll put
whatever you want

01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:47.688
in the car tonight,

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:49.457
and we'll head
for Charlie's hotel.

01:10:49.459 --> 01:10:50.725
I'll just go grab
some stuff,

01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:52.593
and I'll give Charlie
a call, okay?

01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:54.829
Okay.

01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:00.835
It's going to be okay.
You know that?

01:11:00.837 --> 01:11:03.037
I know.

01:11:09.779 --> 01:11:12.180
<i>Hi, you've reached
Charlie Cowley.</i>

01:11:12.182 --> 01:11:14.482
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:29.730
<i>Hi, you've reached
Charlie Cowley.</i>

01:11:29.732 --> 01:11:31.665
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:11:51.788 --> 01:11:52.921
What the hell
are you doing?

01:11:52.923 --> 01:11:54.422
You don't answer
my phone.

01:11:54.424 --> 01:11:55.556
This is not your phone.

01:11:55.558 --> 01:11:57.258
This is Charlie's, and--

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.326
what did you do to him?

01:11:58.328 --> 01:11:59.827
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:11:59.829 --> 01:12:00.828
Stop it.

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:03.364
I already saw the report, okay?

01:12:03.366 --> 01:12:05.033
You saw a report.

01:12:05.035 --> 01:12:06.367
And?

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:07.368
You killed my friends.

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.869
You killed my father.

01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:10.838
And now you killed
Uncle Charlie?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.042
One inconclusive DNA report,
and now I'm a murderer?

01:12:14.044 --> 01:12:15.076
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

01:12:15.078 --> 01:12:16.144
You're worse.

01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:17.478
You're a monster,
and you know it.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.113
Is a lion a monster, hmm?

01:12:19.115 --> 01:12:20.514
Is a bear?

01:12:20.516 --> 01:12:21.515
Bullshit!

01:12:21.517 --> 01:12:22.516
You sadistically

01:12:22.518 --> 01:12:23.751
<i>hunted those kids down</i>

01:12:23.753 --> 01:12:25.553
one by one
and butchered them.

01:12:25.555 --> 01:12:28.689
You're right, kid.

01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:30.791
<i>I did,
but that was your fault.</i>

01:12:30.793 --> 01:12:34.595
I have a cabin
so I can go isolate myself,

01:12:34.597 --> 01:12:36.197
so I can't hurt anyone.

01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:37.731
That's why no one

01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:39.133
<i>is allowed up there.</i>

01:12:39.135 --> 01:12:40.234
<i>But you,</i>

01:12:40.236 --> 01:12:41.902
you brought them right to me.

01:12:41.904 --> 01:12:43.938
You brought them
right to me, kid.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.806
What about my father
and Uncle Charlie, huh?

01:12:45.808 --> 01:12:47.141
What's your excuse
for that?

01:12:58.188 --> 01:13:01.589
We need to settle down here,
kid,

01:13:01.591 --> 01:13:03.458
you and me.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.559
<i>If we work together,</i>

01:13:05.561 --> 01:13:09.263
everything's going to be fine.

01:13:09.265 --> 01:13:11.565
Because, you know,

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:13.468
I'm glad it's out
in the open.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.603
It's a relief.

01:13:15.605 --> 01:13:18.772
Get back!
You need to get back.

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:22.477
There's no silver bullet
in there.

01:13:22.479 --> 01:13:23.911
What if I shoot you
in the head, huh?

01:13:23.913 --> 01:13:25.579
I don't know;
I've never tried that.

01:13:25.581 --> 01:13:26.814
Maybe you should have.

01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:27.982
Maybe I should have.

01:13:29.052 --> 01:13:32.120
Why don't you do it
for me, hmm?

01:13:32.122 --> 01:13:33.087
<i>Right now.</i>

01:13:35.858 --> 01:13:39.494
Why don't you put me out
of my misery?

01:13:40.863 --> 01:13:42.230
Do it.

01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:43.864
Pull the trigger.

01:13:43.866 --> 01:13:45.699
Pull it.

01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:47.101
Pull it!

01:13:47.103 --> 01:13:49.003
Goddamn it,
pull it!

01:13:52.475 --> 01:13:55.209
You're so weak.

01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:57.111
You're just like
your Uncle Charlie.

01:13:57.113 --> 01:13:58.046
Hold on, kid.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:01.382
I can't
let you go.

01:14:01.384 --> 01:14:03.284
What are you doing to do,
kill me?

01:14:04.387 --> 01:14:05.486
If you kill me,

01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:07.688
you'll have to kill
my mom too.

01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:08.789
If we both go missing

01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:11.025
on the exact same day
as Uncle Charlie,

01:14:11.027 --> 01:14:12.927
after what happened
at your cabin,

01:14:12.929 --> 01:14:14.795
who exactly do you think

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:16.797
the police are going
to suspect, huh?

01:14:16.799 --> 01:14:19.200
We're family here--

01:14:19.202 --> 01:14:22.503
No, we're not family,
and we never were.

01:14:22.505 --> 01:14:23.637
You got that?

01:14:23.639 --> 01:14:25.540
Now, my mom and I
are leaving.

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:28.342
I need--I need
that report.

01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:30.945
<i>Derek?</i>

01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:33.381
What's going on?

01:14:33.383 --> 01:14:36.317
We're leaving...now.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:42.256
Gwen, let's talk
about this.

01:14:42.258 --> 01:14:44.525
No,
no more talking.

01:14:44.527 --> 01:14:45.926
I know I was out of line
earlier.

01:14:45.928 --> 01:14:47.261
I've been under
a lot of stress.

01:14:47.263 --> 01:14:49.163
Just keep walking,
Mom.

01:14:49.165 --> 01:14:50.831
You can't just walk out.

01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:52.866
Yes, we can.

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:54.268
<i>Gwen.</i>

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:55.636
Please don't leave.

01:14:58.608 --> 01:14:59.707
Derek?

01:14:59.709 --> 01:15:01.509
<i>This isn't over.</i>

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.415
I promise you.

01:15:08.818 --> 01:15:11.051
Look, you're going
to drop me off

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:12.553
at the Hepburn-Guinness place,
okay?

01:15:12.555 --> 01:15:13.887
What?

01:15:13.889 --> 01:15:15.590
I thought we were going
to Charlie's hotel.

01:15:15.592 --> 01:15:17.258
Mom, look;
I can't explain right now.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.692
You'll just have
to trust me, okay?

01:15:18.694 --> 01:15:21.929
Derek, Gail's place
is a four-hour drive.

01:15:21.931 --> 01:15:23.063
Don't worry about it.

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:24.298
Sam's going
to pick me up.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.699
We'll be right behind you.

01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:28.402
Derek--

01:15:28.404 --> 01:15:30.271
I don't understand.

01:15:30.273 --> 01:15:31.472
It'll all make sense later;
I promise.

01:15:32.642 --> 01:15:33.941
Promise.

01:15:53.963 --> 01:15:55.496
Go away!

01:15:57.267 --> 01:15:59.667
Damn it, Derek.

01:15:59.669 --> 01:16:01.335
I told you--

01:16:02.805 --> 01:16:04.472
<i>You and I have got</i>

01:16:04.474 --> 01:16:06.106
some unfinished business,
don't we?

01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:07.341
<i>Bitch.</i>

01:16:07.343 --> 01:16:08.409
Come here.

01:16:09.845 --> 01:16:10.778
Get off.

01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:15.183
Can you feel it, huh?

01:16:15.185 --> 01:16:16.950
Let's go to the cabin

01:16:16.952 --> 01:16:19.019
and get into
a little bestiality.

01:16:19.021 --> 01:16:21.789
What do you say?

01:16:22.825 --> 01:16:24.858
Hey, Sam--

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.093
<i>Champ, I'm only going</i>

01:16:26.095 --> 01:16:27.861
<i>to say this once,
so listen up.</i>

01:16:27.863 --> 01:16:30.030
<i>Your slut girlfriend,
she'll be at the cabin tonight.</i>

01:16:30.032 --> 01:16:31.865
<i>If you're not there,
she dies.</i>

01:16:31.867 --> 01:16:37.171
<i>Come alone, or she'll end up
like your fr-fr-friends.</i>

01:17:29.359 --> 01:17:30.858
There it is.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.227
That's where they died,
right there.

01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:34.562
It's spooky.

01:17:34.564 --> 01:17:35.829
Fisher, Suneel,
come here.

01:17:35.831 --> 01:17:36.897
Come on, quick.

01:17:36.899 --> 01:17:38.932
All right, start rolling.

01:17:38.934 --> 01:17:41.402
At this cabin,
four innocent students met

01:17:41.404 --> 01:17:42.670
their gruesome deaths.

01:17:42.672 --> 01:17:45.172
What mysteries does
this house of horror hold?

01:17:45.174 --> 01:17:47.275
We plan to unlock them
tonight.

01:17:47.277 --> 01:17:48.276
Okay, go.

01:17:48.278 --> 01:17:49.910
What do you mean,
"unlock them"?

01:17:49.912 --> 01:17:51.412
We're going inside.

01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:52.546
No way.
Get real.

01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:53.648
No, we are.

01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:55.349
Okay, there's a broken window
right there.

01:17:55.351 --> 01:17:56.817
We're getting in.
Come on.

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.356
<i>Watch the glass.</i>

01:18:26.015 --> 01:18:27.047
Is that blood?

01:18:27.049 --> 01:18:28.081
[screams]

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.116
I don't like this.

01:18:29.118 --> 01:18:30.884
It isn't right, being here.

01:18:30.886 --> 01:18:32.119
Relax, all right?

01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:34.087
When you work in Iraq,
you see a lot worse.

01:18:34.089 --> 01:18:35.989
Shut up, Baxter.
You've never been to Iraq.

01:18:37.927 --> 01:18:39.360
<i>Oh, my God, somebody's here.</i>

01:18:40.496 --> 01:18:42.396
What?

01:18:43.966 --> 01:18:45.466
Okay, quick,
the bedroom.

01:18:45.468 --> 01:18:47.167
Fisher, keep shooting.

01:19:08.491 --> 01:19:10.391
We have to get out
of here.

01:19:10.393 --> 01:19:11.625
No, someone
could be outside.

01:19:11.627 --> 01:19:15.496
We have company.

01:19:15.498 --> 01:19:18.499
Don't you say a word.

01:19:43.559 --> 01:19:45.993
I don't hear anything.

01:19:48.197 --> 01:19:49.630
What are you doing?

01:20:02.812 --> 01:20:04.311
<i>Who is that?</i>

01:20:05.515 --> 01:20:07.281
Come here. Come here.
Get this.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.319
<i>We should help her.</i>

01:20:13.489 --> 01:20:14.988
Get out of here now!

01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.956
I mean it; get out!

01:20:42.785 --> 01:20:45.018
No, no!

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.086
No.

01:20:46.088 --> 01:20:47.187
<i>No.</i>

01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:20.788
Let's help the others!

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.055
You can wait for them.
I'm not.

01:21:22.057 --> 01:21:24.191
Hurry.
Shit.

01:21:57.192 --> 01:21:58.359
<i>Derek.</i>

01:21:58.361 --> 01:22:00.361
Sam.

01:22:00.363 --> 01:22:02.363
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:22:02.365 --> 01:22:03.430
Are you okay?

01:22:06.969 --> 01:22:08.502
Help me.

01:22:08.504 --> 01:22:09.837
We'll use these.

01:22:09.839 --> 01:22:12.373
Are those--
Yeah.

01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:14.007
Good thinking.

01:22:14.009 --> 01:22:15.376
How did you get here?

01:22:15.378 --> 01:22:16.543
Your bike.

01:22:16.545 --> 01:22:18.111
Wonders never cease.

01:22:19.515 --> 01:22:20.514
Okay.

01:22:20.516 --> 01:22:22.449
Let's go.
Are you ready?

01:22:22.451 --> 01:22:25.118
What about them?

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.488
Where's your car?

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:29.423
Not far,
but Suneel has the keys.

01:22:29.425 --> 01:22:31.224
Shit.

01:22:31.226 --> 01:22:32.959
Okay, okay,
we can do this.

01:22:32.961 --> 01:22:34.795
Come on.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:40.133
Okay, so we're going
to barricade ourself in

01:22:40.135 --> 01:22:42.536
and just hold out
till morning, okay?

01:22:42.538 --> 01:22:43.970
Let's block the window.

01:22:43.972 --> 01:22:45.472
Come on.

01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:01.488
<i>There; that should hold it.</i>

01:23:07.029 --> 01:23:08.595
Âang!

01:23:13.168 --> 01:23:16.437
<i>Pigs, little pigs, let me in.</i>

01:23:16.439 --> 01:23:18.004
Go fuck yourself.

01:23:28.016 --> 01:23:29.382
Oh, that wasn't

01:23:29.384 --> 01:23:30.751
<i>very nice.</i>

01:23:30.753 --> 01:23:32.786
You know, you could put
an eye out like that.

01:23:32.788 --> 01:23:34.688
<i>I got a surprise
for you.</i>

01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:37.090
Stay right there.

01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:42.830
Wait, wait, wait,
what--

01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:45.899
Shit.

01:23:45.901 --> 01:23:46.934
News flash.

01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.068
You don't open the door,

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:49.102
<i>I hurt the girl.</i>

01:23:49.104 --> 01:23:50.136
We gotta do something.

01:23:50.138 --> 01:23:51.304
I only want Derek and Sam.

01:23:51.306 --> 01:23:53.039
You all live

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:54.675
<i>if you give me
Derek and Sam.</i>

01:23:54.677 --> 01:23:56.009
No, guys, he's lying.

01:23:56.011 --> 01:23:57.911
He's just going to get you
out there and kill you.

01:24:00.315 --> 01:24:01.748
Guys, no.

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:02.783
No!

01:24:02.785 --> 01:24:04.417
He only wants you.

01:24:04.419 --> 01:24:05.452
Don't be an idiot!

01:24:05.454 --> 01:24:07.554
Get out of the way.

01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:09.890
You idiot.

01:24:14.262 --> 01:24:15.662
Go, go.
Wait, Jasmine!

01:24:15.664 --> 01:24:17.998
No time.
Go, go, go!

01:24:19.635 --> 01:24:20.968
Hurry, go!

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:23.637
<i>Don't worry.</i>

01:24:23.639 --> 01:24:25.105
<i>I'll be back.</i>

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:29.643
<i>But first I have
a cute blonde to entertain.</i>

01:24:47.429 --> 01:24:49.029
Hey.

01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:50.531
Hey, look at this.

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:53.133
You any good?

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:54.300
I'm okay.

01:24:54.302 --> 01:24:55.836
Kind of an old set,
though.

01:24:55.838 --> 01:24:58.071
You really think
it'll slow him down?

01:24:58.073 --> 01:25:02.242
Maybe if we use
the steak knives as arrowheads.

01:25:02.244 --> 01:25:04.945
That just might work.

01:25:08.150 --> 01:25:10.183
I don't know how aerodynamic
this will be.

01:25:11.654 --> 01:25:14.955
I'm not grading you
on your marksmanship.

01:25:14.957 --> 01:25:16.823
How can you be so callus?

01:25:16.825 --> 01:25:17.958
<i>All my friends are dead,</i>

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.793
and we're going to die too.

01:25:19.795 --> 01:25:21.628
Would you stop
your whining?

01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:22.996
<i>You have to decide
right now</i>

01:25:22.998 --> 01:25:24.230
whether you want
to live or die.

01:25:24.232 --> 01:25:25.498
It's as simple as that.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.970
It doesn't matter what I want
or what I say.

01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:33.239
We are going to die.

01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:35.108
<i>Well, if that's your attitude,
you probably--</i>

01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:45.085
You gonna eat that?

01:25:45.087 --> 01:25:47.087
Come on.
Let's move!

01:25:50.258 --> 01:25:51.925
Go.
Wait.

01:25:53.095 --> 01:25:55.028
What, are you crazy?
We got to keep going.

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.329
What if we get
to the motorcycle?

01:25:56.331 --> 01:25:57.430
I mean, then what?

01:25:57.432 --> 01:25:59.032
We just keep running
and hiding?

01:25:59.034 --> 01:26:00.333
This has
to end tonight, Sam.

01:26:00.335 --> 01:26:02.769
This has to end right now.

01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:03.904
<i>Oh, yeah, Derek.</i>

01:26:03.906 --> 01:26:06.372
We stay here any longer,
it is going to end.

01:26:06.374 --> 01:26:08.274
No, I mean it, Sam.

01:26:08.276 --> 01:26:10.677
Who would have thought?

01:26:10.679 --> 01:26:13.179
Derek Cowley,
fearless werewolf killer.

01:26:15.084 --> 01:26:18.619
Fearless?
I'm scared shitless.

01:26:23.626 --> 01:26:25.058
Ready?

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.359
This should be enough

01:26:26.361 --> 01:26:28.194
for you to get
a really good shot, okay?

01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:37.471
What the hell?

01:26:43.446 --> 01:26:44.644
Shit.

01:26:46.882 --> 01:26:49.083
You think that would stop me?

01:26:49.085 --> 01:26:50.117
No, but this might.

01:26:52.688 --> 01:26:53.854
God damn it.

01:27:11.807 --> 01:27:13.673
Hit him again.

01:27:19.348 --> 01:27:21.248
We could have had
such fun together,

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:23.017
but you really
piss me off.

01:27:34.863 --> 01:27:36.430
Down goes Frazier!

01:27:48.911 --> 01:27:50.911
You'll pay for that.

01:27:56.985 --> 01:28:00.620
Ole!

01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:03.623
Who's got it now,
kid, huh, huh?

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:05.859
Got to hand it
to you, boy.

01:28:05.861 --> 01:28:09.229
You put up a better fight
than your old man.

01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:13.300
Killing him was like leading
a lamb to slaughter.

01:28:13.302 --> 01:28:15.335
No!

01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:18.638
Shut up!
Shut up!

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.574
I'm not afraid of you.

01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:23.410
Say hello to your old man.

01:28:47.769 --> 01:28:49.236
Come on.

01:28:49.238 --> 01:28:51.105
Come on.

01:29:00.682 --> 01:29:03.350
I think we made it.

01:29:27.376 --> 01:29:30.410
It's over.

01:29:56.305 --> 01:29:59.106
Tag, you're it!

01:29:59.108 --> 01:30:00.707
Derek!

01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:24.231
My curse is now yours.

01:30:37.712 --> 01:30:41.281
I--I can't believe,
after all the--

01:30:41.283 --> 01:30:43.550
all the shit we've been though,
after all of this,

01:30:43.552 --> 01:30:47.054
it's just for me to end up
just like him.

01:30:47.056 --> 01:30:50.090
No, you don't know that.

01:30:50.092 --> 01:30:55.228
Look, whatever happens,
we'll get through it...

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:57.531
together.

01:31:17.018 --> 01:31:18.685
Come on.

01:35:10.452 --> 01:35:13.386
