WEBVTT

00:16.417 --> 00:18.086
- There you go.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.620
Anything you can do
to move this along.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.488
Okay, I'll do my best.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.056
- Thank you.
- All right.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.806
How is this guy?
Usually on time?

00:38.806 --> 00:41.275
More or less.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.344
It pisses me off
the way doctors--

00:43.344 --> 00:45.713
They keep you waiting,
keep you waiting.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.249
Like their time is
more valuable than ours.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.451
Right? Pricks.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.857
Hi. Small world.

00:56.857 --> 00:57.991
Sam Myers.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.861
Myers. Help me out here.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.597
- David's father.
- Oh, for goodness sake.
How are you?

01:03.597 --> 01:04.932
- How are you?
- Good.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.500
Have we ever actually met?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.035
Briefly.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.138
I recognize you from the papers.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.673
Yeah, well...

01:12.673 --> 01:15.309
Something serious,
or just a checkup?

01:15.309 --> 01:20.681
No, my wife forced me
to come down here.
How about yourself?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.016
Bad ticker.
Had a heart attack last summer.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.952
- No shit.
- Uh-huh.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.554
What was that like?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.689
Like Shelley Winters
is sitting on your chest.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.425
And I'm not talking
"Place in the Sun"
Shelley Winters.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.394
- "Poseidon Adventure."
- Yeah.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.464
So how did that-- What?
Were there warning signs?

01:36.464 --> 01:40.401
I'm a 57-year-old Jew,
my entire life is
a warning sign.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.771
So now what?
What does this guy have you do?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.174
You, like,
on a low-sodium diet, or...

01:46.174 --> 01:48.776
No smoking.
Watch the stress.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.044
Watch the stress.
They always tell you
watch the stress.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.180
How the fuck
do you watch stress?

01:52.180 --> 01:54.915
I got a cat.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.584
Also a divorce.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.519
Oh, I didn't--
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.189
It's all right.
It happens.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.490
Yep.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.194
Although, it's funny.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.199
In my parent's day,
when two spouses
were having trouble,

02:11.199 --> 02:14.368
they just moved
the Barcalounger a few
inches further apart.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.337
Fewer lawyers then.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.742
You and Skye's mom,
you're still together, right?

02:21.742 --> 02:25.579
Yeah. Just had our anniversary,
actually-- 25 years.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.382
- Twenty-five years. Wow.
- Twenty-five. Yep.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.651
That's something
in today's day and age.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.820
- How about that?
- Mr. Passarello?

02:39.293 --> 02:40.961
So our kids are
on the outs, huh?

02:40.961 --> 02:44.798
- So I hear.
- Any idea what happened?

02:44.798 --> 02:47.235
Nobody tells me anything.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.802
Although I gotta say,
my daughter,

02:48.802 --> 02:49.903
I love her to death,

02:49.903 --> 02:51.539
she can be quite a pain
in the ass sometimes.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.906
Oh, please. My David?
Don't get me started.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.075
He's no Prince Charming.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.477
- Moody kid.
- Moody.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.246
Oh, my God, like his mother...

02:58.246 --> 03:00.448
although he's
a very hard worker,

03:00.448 --> 03:02.750
self-motivated,
a real self-starter.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.818
All right, all right.
I get it.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.455
I get it. He told you
I offered him a job?

03:07.455 --> 03:09.790
- He did.
- Yeah.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.460
- I'm very grateful.
- No. Listen, my pleasure.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.295
- He's a good kid.
- It's very generous of you.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.599
Well, he's a good kid
when he's not tripping over
his own dick.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.001
- Mr. Getty?
- Here we go. That's me.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.471
- All right.
Nice talking to you.
- Good luck.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.038
- A little checkup.
- No, I mean--

03:25.038 --> 03:26.940
I mean with the trial.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.110
Yeah, okay.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.879
We were able
to get you in earlier.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.947
Yeah. All right. Thank you.

03:45.293 --> 03:48.396
- Hey!
- Hey, Doug!

03:48.396 --> 03:49.863
- Fay!
- What do you say, Wes?

03:49.863 --> 03:51.765
I hope I can count
on your vote today.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.301
Just now.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.035
You're the best.
You're a good man.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.304
Love to Rachel, huh?

03:56.304 --> 03:58.639
Will do.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.608
Take care.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.009
Can't wait till
this election's over.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.844
I can stop pretending
I give a shit about people.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.179
Oh, my God. Enough with
the fucking election already.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.317
I don't think you've noticed,
but we got other problems.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.086
What's the matter
with your salad?

04:13.086 --> 04:16.324
- I'm not hungry.
- Want a bite of mine?

04:16.324 --> 04:18.859
- How can you eat?
- What?

04:18.859 --> 04:23.096
What's gonna happen to us
if you go to jail?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.333
Conjugal visits.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.067
You know.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.337
You think this is funny?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.871
Do you?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.441
Bunch of pervy inmates
watching us while we--

04:33.441 --> 04:35.208
- Sweetie.
- Oh, my God.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.478
Listen to me.
Look at me.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.347
We're gonna be fine.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.981
I got a good feeling
about this.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.784
It's breaking our way.
It's already breaking--

04:43.784 --> 04:48.055
You saw how my guys destroyed
those state witnesses, right?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.723
We're fine.
Trust me.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.827
Don't even worry.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.166
Hey, don't eat my fries.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.369
- I could eat whatever I want.
- Yes, you ca--

05:01.369 --> 05:03.704
Excuse me. Do me a favor.
Take this gerbil food away.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.939
- Bring my wife a cheeseburger.
- Be right back.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.778
I love you so much.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.913
Don't you leave me.
Promise me.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.450
- You gonna--
- I promise.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.652
- Yeah?
- Don't you worry.

05:24.425 --> 05:29.630
So you given any more thought
of coming to work for me?

05:29.630 --> 05:32.833
- Actually, I have.
- And?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.403
And...

05:35.403 --> 05:38.939
as much as I appreciate
the offer...

05:38.939 --> 05:42.610
I think I'm gonna have
to decline, respectfully.

05:44.612 --> 05:49.116
Okay. May I ask why?

05:49.116 --> 05:50.851
Well, I just don't think
I'd be any good at it.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
- Or happy.
- Happy?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.888
Okay.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.824
Let me see if
I can explain this to you.

05:56.824 --> 06:00.461
Happy is how you feel when you
go to your kids' dance recital,

06:00.461 --> 06:03.263
or you see McEnroe swearing
at a line judge.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.765
That's happy.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.000
It's not something you
expect from your work.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.637
Why do think they call it work?
They don't call it chuckles.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.105
Because it doesn't
make you happy.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.143
I'm sorry, Mr. Getty.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.784
You're serious?

06:23.784 --> 06:24.718
Yeah.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.524
Okay.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.493
All right.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.030
Is that how you wanna end up?

06:37.030 --> 06:41.835
You wanna be 40,
chasing fucking balls
around a court?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.572
- He's not 40 yet.
- What?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.640
Not till Friday.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.078
- You being a wiseass now?
- No. No, sir.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.516
Okay.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.753
I should have trusted
my first instinct about you.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.055
Think I'm getting soft
in my old age.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.638
Judy!

07:19.740 --> 07:22.643
Oh, my God.
He's gorgeous.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.012
Look at those cheeks.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.847
How do you feel?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.116
- Tired.
- Don't worry.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.719
That only lasts about
another 18 to 20 years.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.086
Oh!

07:33.086 --> 07:34.688
- Oh!
- Yes.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.757
Oh, um, where
should I put these?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.592
Just over there
with the others. Thanks.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.360
Okay.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.595
Oh, Margot was here?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.063
Yeah, you just missed her.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.131
Good.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.432
I feel bad.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.067
You know,
I haven't called her.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.570
Oh, don't worry about Margot.
She's a big girl.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.540
- And not the type
to wait by the phone.
- Want some cookies?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.274
Sam stopped by with them.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.545
- My Sam?
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.946
How do you know
my ex-husband?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.148
We play poker
every Tuesday night.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.917
He's a great guy.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.019
- Hmm?
- No thanks.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.923
Do you wanna hold him?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.425
- Oh, can I?
- Of course.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.829
Oh! Get out of the way.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.298
- Wanna say hi to Judy?
- Hi.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.433
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.369
Oh, hello, handsome.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.437
Oh, hello.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.207
Enjoy this moment.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.709
It goes so fast.

08:35.716 --> 08:39.753
Help yourself to my fries.
I'm going for a steam.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.789
What time are you meeting Ganz?

08:41.789 --> 08:44.024
- He said 5:00.
- You think he'll go for it?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.593
I don't know.
I hope so.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.211
Hey, Ganz.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.748
Thanks for agreeing
to meet with me.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.719
Flash the Bat-Signal,
I appear.

09:13.854 --> 09:17.925
Yeah, I'll admit,
I was surprised
to hear from you.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.360
Yeah, well, you see,
me and my very best friend,

09:20.360 --> 09:21.795
we needed a big, fat favor.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.130
Interesting.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.635
Let's talk.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.306
Okay, here's one
for Dr. Feinberg.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.910
And one for Douglas Getty.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.681
One for Dr. Feinberg.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.716
And one for Douglas Getty.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.653
One for Dr. Feinberg.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.454
Any more?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.056
No.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.424
Okay, then,
let's get the tally.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.729
Dr. Feinberg has 116 votes.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.066
And the tally
for Mr. Getty is...

10:10.043 --> 10:12.880
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.347
- Yeah!
- Fuck. This sucks.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.316
- You won by 28 votes.
- I'll take it.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.952
Thank you, Herb.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.921
Congratulations, Doug.
You ran a hard race.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.589
Hey. And to you.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.524
Gotta run. I got a thing.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.759
I'm sure you do.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.374
So conventional wisdom
is to start with
"Blood and Black Lace."

10:41.374 --> 10:43.510
But for my money, Ben,
the best entry point

10:43.510 --> 10:45.478
for Italian exploitation cinema?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.080
"Bay of Blood."

10:47.080 --> 10:48.982
Also known as
"Twitch of the Death Nerve."

10:48.982 --> 10:51.018
Oh, and then you're gonna do
a double-feature--

10:51.018 --> 10:52.119
"Lizard in a Woman's Skin,"

10:52.119 --> 10:53.954
and "Don't Torture a Duckling."

10:53.954 --> 10:56.790
And then you're ready
for "il maestro di giallo,"

10:56.790 --> 10:58.625
Dario Argento.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.161
- Hey, look what
the cat coughed up.
- Hey.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.897
What, are you cutting some
wedding footage or something?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.833
Actually, I stopped by
to talk to you about something.

11:05.833 --> 11:09.436
Oh, uh, Ben,
get me some ice cream.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.274
What's up?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.744
Yeah, I've given a lot
of thought to coming
to work here,

11:16.744 --> 11:17.845
- and--
- Yeah.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.747
...I think
I'm gonna have to pass.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.318
- I get it.
- Not that I don't
appreciate the offer.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.653
I do. It's just...

11:26.653 --> 11:28.088
I don't see myself
working in TV.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.223
Yeah, well, who does?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.992
You think I wanted
to work in television?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.060
- No?
- No.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.762
I wanted to make movies.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.297
Soon as I graduated from
college, I packed up my car,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.766
drove out to Tinsletown.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.769
That's where the action is...
or was.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.271
Now all the maverick auteurs
are in New York City.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.140
- How long were you out there?
- Seven years.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.843
I worked every job
I could get in the industry.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.279
Mail room, drove a tour van.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.314
I even spent a summer
dressing up as John Wayne

11:54.314 --> 11:56.683
for tourists
outside Grauman's Chinese.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.853
You mean like
a celebrity impersonator?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.989
We prefer the term
"tribute artists."

12:03.256 --> 12:05.859
Anyway, I fell into
TV production out there,

12:05.859 --> 12:09.529
and I discovered it suited
my skills better

12:09.529 --> 12:11.164
and my circadian rhythms

12:11.164 --> 12:13.901
as I'm not a fan of daylight.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.535
It's another reason
I left L.A.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.104
Makes sense.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.040
Right? Better.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.308
- Yeah.
- You see it.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.309
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.544
You got the eye.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.915
So what are you gonna do next?

12:27.915 --> 12:30.550
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.820
Yeah.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.855
I'm not much
for giving advice.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
I leave that
to the professionals

12:36.123 --> 12:38.125
like Rhonda, Dr. Ruth.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.060
But I'll tell you this.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.662
You're not gonna
figure it out here.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.697
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's a nice town.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.833
You can raise a family here,

12:45.833 --> 12:47.968
meet other camera enthusiasts,

12:47.968 --> 12:49.569
swap Polaroids of your ex-wives.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.905
If that's your thing, great.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.908
But if your thing
is making movies,

12:54.908 --> 12:56.910
it's not happening in Jersey.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.429
Okay.

13:18.866 --> 13:19.967
Thank you.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.336
I've just been told

13:23.336 --> 13:25.572
the jury has completed
its deliberations

13:25.572 --> 13:26.539
and has reached a verdict.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.289
I tell you,
I'm getting
quite claustrophobic.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.623
Thought you sleep
with an eye mask.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.058
Yes, but that's different.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.794
I'm sleeping,
and it's satin and stylish

13:47.794 --> 13:49.496
and doesn't reek of scrotum.

13:49.496 --> 13:53.433
I had three uncles murdered
in this exact fashion.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.903
- Right. We're almost there.
- All right.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.070
Oh...

14:00.407 --> 14:02.042
Happy 40th, Nash.

14:03.911 --> 14:07.080
You bought me a boat?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.449
- Rented you a boat.
- From the both of us.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.927
Let's go, gents!

14:19.927 --> 14:23.596
**

14:36.743 --> 14:38.979
* If you've got a crush *

14:38.979 --> 14:40.180
* Don't beat around the bush *

14:40.180 --> 14:42.615
* When I've got a crush *

14:42.615 --> 14:43.951
* Run runaway *

14:43.951 --> 14:45.953
* See chameleon *

14:45.953 --> 14:47.687
* Lying there in the sun *

14:47.687 --> 14:49.622
* All things to everyone *

14:49.622 --> 14:51.558
* Run runaway *

15:02.235 --> 15:05.505
- I think we really
surprised him.
- Totally!

15:05.505 --> 15:08.175
Still don't know how
you convinced Ganz
to let us rent his boat.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.978
Kind of agreed to be
his inside guy at Cornell.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.146
- Oh, shit.
- It's cool.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.115
I told him I'd only deal weed.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.584
I don't like to
think of it as selling
an illegal substance so much

15:17.584 --> 15:20.453
- as providing a public service.
- How's that?

15:20.453 --> 15:23.423
People up there
seriously stress.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.493
**

15:26.493 --> 15:31.364
Oh, whoa, cool.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.002
- Hey, it's Herb!
- Hi, guy! What's your poison?

15:35.002 --> 15:37.437
How about a Sex on the Beach?
You know how to make one
of those?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.472
- Make it two.
- Okay.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.874
- So, what are you
and Misty gonna do?
- I don't know.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.344
Try to make the whole
long-distance thing work,
I guess.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.213
I mean, Ithaca's
only four hours away.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.747
It's not like it's the moon.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.816
- Or Paris.
- Exactly.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.551
You know, sometimes I think
things with Skye were best

15:51.551 --> 15:53.520
when we were thousands
of miles apart.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.256
Wow. That's crazy.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.690
Okay, here we go.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.160
Oh, nice!

16:00.160 --> 16:03.463
- Thank you, Herb.
- It's nine dollars.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.433
This isn't a Sex on the Beach.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.635
No, it isn't.
Vodka tonic.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
But if you drink enough,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.739
you may have sex on a boat.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.342
Let's get drunk.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.744
I don't mind if I do.
It's my birthday.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.415
Oh, dear. What seems to be
the matter, Skip?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.085
Oh, my God.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.254
- Seasick.
- Seasick?

16:27.254 --> 16:30.057
- We're docked.
- It doesn't matter.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.725
- And we're on a river.
- Oh, God.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.628
The minnows will
be feasting tonight.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.631
- Are there girls looking?
- Oh, yes.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.634
Every single girl on this deck
is looking at you right now.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.703
It's okay.
He's just vomiting.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.872
Would you like a little bubbly
to settle the tummy?

16:45.872 --> 16:48.508
- No, thank you.
- All right.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.146
Whoa! This yacht is bigger
than my house.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.754
Hey, wanna mess around?

17:01.754 --> 17:04.424
- Now?
- Yeah.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.096
- No, thanks.
- Oh.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.463
Pretty please.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.834
What's wrong?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.536
Nothing.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.774
Come on, tell me.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.981
What's gonna happen to us,
Wheeler?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.817
What do you mean?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.686
I mean, when you go to school.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.229
Nothing. I mean, sure,
it'll be a little tough

17:42.229 --> 17:43.596
that first year
while I'm up there

17:43.596 --> 17:45.265
and you're still here
finishing your degree.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.136
But we'll visit each other
and talk all the time...

17:49.136 --> 17:51.671
and have a ton of phone sex.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.274
Mostly on nights and weekends
when rates are lower.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.675
Mm-hmm.

17:57.144 --> 18:01.448
Until you meet some smart girl
and forget all about me?

18:01.448 --> 18:03.150
It's not gonna happen.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.033
You have to be very quiet.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.670
I'm so quiet, I'm a mouse.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.673
Would the jury
foreman please rise?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.211
Has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

19:04.211 --> 19:05.645
We have, Your Honor.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.628
Will the defendant please rise?

19:25.632 --> 19:28.067
On the counts
of insider trading,

19:28.067 --> 19:29.502
securities and mail fraud,

19:29.502 --> 19:32.939
and providing false statements
to the government,

19:32.939 --> 19:34.841
the jury finds Douglas Getty...

19:41.248 --> 19:42.649
Guilty on all counts.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.019
The jury is thanked and excused.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.922
Court is dismissed.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.214
It'll be okay.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.919
It'll all be okay.
It's gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.021
Okay?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.290
I love you.

20:23.290 --> 20:27.026
I'm gonna take her outside
for some air.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.262
That's a good idea.
Come here.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.534
Okay.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.937
It's okay. It's okay.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.309
- How did you know?
- Know what?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.513
To come today.
How did you know the verdict
was coming down today?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.983
David told me.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.626
It's gonna be okay.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.439
Yeah.

21:23.149 --> 21:27.554
- There he is,
the birthday boy!
- Having fun?

21:27.554 --> 21:29.722
Beep, bom, bom!
Oh, my boychiks!

21:29.722 --> 21:31.658
Fun does not begin
to describe it.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.627
This is a day
that I will remember
for the rest of my life,

21:34.627 --> 21:37.364
even if I live
to be 100 years old.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.567
Which, by the way,
a lot of the men in my
family actually do,

21:40.567 --> 21:43.570
once they lay off the sweets
and the vengeful women.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.540
Thank you, boychiks.

21:50.543 --> 21:54.046
Ahoy! Well, well, well!

21:54.046 --> 21:56.549
Looks like someone's got
their sea legs back.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.551
Yeah,
I had some Captain Morgan's,

21:58.551 --> 22:00.453
a little gin, club soda.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.988
Feel a lot better.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.055
In fact.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.527
Come on down here, buddy.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.095
Turn and burn.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.139
Another summer, huh?

22:20.139 --> 22:22.208
Yeah.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.711
Think you'll be back
to Red Oaks next year?

22:24.711 --> 22:27.046
I barely know
what I'm doing next week,

22:27.046 --> 22:28.415
let alone next summer.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.786
It's gonna happen
for you, dude.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.987
I feel it.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.289
Maybe.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.891
I know one thing, though.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.960
It's not happening here
in Jersey.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.696
Hey, pizza's here.
Grabbed you a slice.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.099
That is why I love you.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.801
You do?

22:53.172 --> 22:55.742
Uh, yeah, sure.

22:55.742 --> 22:59.612
But, you know,
don't feel like you have
to say it back or anything.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.655
Eat your pizza.
Watch the sunset.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.073
You got enough room?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.941
Because your mom and I
could follow in the Volvo.

23:28.941 --> 23:29.776
No, I got it.

23:29.776 --> 23:33.480
Hey hey hey! There he is!

23:33.480 --> 23:35.482
Big man on campus!

23:35.482 --> 23:37.316
Hey, Mr. Myers, Mrs. Myers!

23:37.316 --> 23:39.586
Ah! Sorry! I mean Rosen.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.921
No, call us Sam and Judy.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.323
Actually, Mr. Myers
still works for me.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.393
All right. I'm sorry, I can't
really stay too long.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.928
I got my own packing
to do.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.164
- Oh.
- When do classes start?

23:52.164 --> 23:54.000
- Monday.
- Good for you.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.868
Very good.
Very proud of you.

23:55.868 --> 24:00.039
Thank you, Sam and Judy--
I mean Mr. Myers.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.509
- You're really doing this!
- I know. It's crazy.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.243
It's awesome!
I'm psyched for you.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.945
Making that leap.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.815
I'm psyched for you too,
Mr. Ivy League.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.383
Hey, you ever get
a hankering for
the campus life,

24:11.383 --> 24:13.620
you know my dorm room's
always open.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.622
Oh, definitely.
Soon as I'm settled,
I'm coming up.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.724
- Cool.
- Cool.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.526
- Cool.
- Cool.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.528
- Cool.
- Cool.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.835
Bye-bye.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.808
- What?
- Humor us.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.577
It's an emotional moment,

24:37.577 --> 24:39.245
especially for your ma.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.548
My baby.

24:45.184 --> 24:48.087
Mom, come on. It's not like
I'm moving to Guam.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.795
I love you.

25:00.099 --> 25:05.371
Honey, I know I can be
a pain in the ass sometimes,

25:05.371 --> 25:07.306
and I ride you too much,

25:07.306 --> 25:10.076
but I'm your dad.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.611
It's my job.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.879
I know.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.081
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.201
Bye!

25:47.446 --> 25:50.216
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.151
Good.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.020
Because I'll lay you
even money

25:54.020 --> 25:55.722
that he's back
on one of our couches

25:55.722 --> 25:56.923
in the next few months.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.825
Oh, Sam.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.627
I wish I understood
what he was doing,

26:00.627 --> 26:03.730
but truth is
I haven't got a clue.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.964
Me neither.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.934
Think he's making a mistake?

26:07.934 --> 26:12.639
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.174
Maybe we should let him.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.394
Hey, it's David.
I'm not here right now.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.096
Please leave a message
after the beep.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.732
Hey, it's me.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.600
I got your number
from your dad.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.703
I, um, I just wanted
to call and say that

27:16.703 --> 27:19.338
I watched your tape of Paris,
and I loved it.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.008
Uh, so...

27:22.008 --> 27:26.078
you can probably imagine things
are pretty crazy around here.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.715
My dad's lawyers are appealing.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.417
Oh, and believe it or not,

27:31.417 --> 27:34.954
I am taking a studio art class
at the New School.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.856
Yeah, I know.

27:36.856 --> 27:37.990
But my professor's
really great.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.726
And I'm enjoying it.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.627
So, um, I have to go,

27:41.627 --> 27:45.732
but... I don't know.
I just wanted
to call and say that

27:45.732 --> 27:48.534
I'm happy that you finally got
your place in the city.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.502
I bet you're really excited.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.274
Maybe we'll run
into each other sometime.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.876
Okay. Bye.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.435
**

28:41.520 --> 28:43.089
Make it up.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.058
As we go along.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.063
Mmm.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.606
* I've been in a cave *

29:00.606 --> 29:02.909
* For 40 days *

29:02.909 --> 29:05.144
* Only a spark *

29:05.144 --> 29:07.679
* To light my way *

29:07.679 --> 29:09.882
* I want to give out *

29:09.882 --> 29:12.251
* I want to give in *

29:12.251 --> 29:14.821
* This is our crime *

29:14.821 --> 29:16.923
* This is our sin *

29:16.923 --> 29:19.558
* But I still believe *

29:19.558 --> 29:21.861
* I still believe *

29:21.861 --> 29:24.230
* Through the pain *

29:24.230 --> 29:26.732
* And through the grief *

29:26.732 --> 29:28.935
* Through the lies *

29:28.935 --> 29:31.603
* Through the storms *

29:31.603 --> 29:33.605
* Through the cries *

29:33.605 --> 29:35.641
* And through the wars *

29:35.641 --> 29:37.509
* Oh, I still believe *

29:45.551 --> 29:51.523
**

30:17.616 --> 30:19.485
**
