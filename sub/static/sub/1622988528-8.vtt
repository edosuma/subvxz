WEBVTT

01:54.156 --> 01:55.449
Did he take her?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.077
No. She took him.

01:59.620 --> 02:04.374
Well... for how long? I mean...
When-- When is she coming back?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.084
She might not come back.
You know that, don't you?

02:06.168 --> 02:08.211
No, I don't. I don't know anything,
so stop freaking me out, okay?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.838
Well, you already are freaking out.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.299
All we can do is wait.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.927
I liked you better when
you were catatonic. I really did.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.512
Oh, well, that's
a really shitty thing to say.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.056
All right. I'm-- I'm getting
the lights on. Are you okay?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.182
No!

02:28.565 --> 02:29.566
Lisey?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.071
Lisey?

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
Lisey.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.225
This way.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.855
This way.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.032
Come on.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.884
Look at me!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.158
What did you do to me?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.917
What did you do to me, you bitch?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.321
I am the son of Scott Landon.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.743
I am the prophet.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.040
I am the lighthouse.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.050
Beam me up, Scotty.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.016
Oh, Lisey.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
-Lisey, sweetie.
-Oh, hey.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.563
-Oh, God.
-God, Lisey. We were so scared.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.903
-Are you all right?
-Yes. And he's gone.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.321
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.031
Good.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.617
You lied about the gun.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.578
Yeah, I did.
Do you wanna get into that now?

10:20.329 --> 10:21.330
No.

10:22.956 --> 10:27.252
All right. You were never here.
You understand that?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.505
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:29.588 --> 10:33.759
Scott was there for you,
guiding you all along, wasn't he?

10:34.718 --> 10:35.719
He was.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.176
Oh, Dan.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.179
Oh.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.348
I'm so sorry.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.644
Cleaves Mills Police.
Officer Rory Hall speaking.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.604
Hi, it's Lisa Landon.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.064
Something terrible has happened.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.357
Are you all right, Mrs. Landon?

13:35.440 --> 13:40.529
No, I'm all right. I just came out
to check for storm damage and...

13:43.699 --> 13:46.827
I need you to come out here, right away.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.121
Yeah, of course.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.331
Yeah. Thank you.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.459
-All right. We're on our way.
-Okay.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.658
Lisey. A word?

14:27.826 --> 14:28.827
Sure.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.373
We'll meet you at the diner?
You want some pie?

14:33.457 --> 14:34.458
Blueberry?

14:38.170 --> 14:41.340
-First time in front of the grand jury?
-Yeah.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.633
Intimidating?

14:42.716 --> 14:46.261
Not really. They just wanted to know how
I found Officer Beckman, and I told them.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.306
You came out to check storm damage.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.351
Exactly.
Can I help you with anything else?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.394
You never asked.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.896
What's that?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.606
About Jim Dooley.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.942
Yeah. They find him?

15:00.025 --> 15:02.194
Nope. Found the truck he was driving.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.447
But as for him, no sign.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.160
Maybe he got scared
after he shot Dan and ran away.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.747
On foot? You think so?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.583
You got something on your mind, Craig?

15:18.752 --> 15:19.753
Well...

15:21.046 --> 15:24.216
Dan Beckman was a good officer
and a good friend.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.011
Dooley shot him down like a dog.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.597
If something happened
to the man who did that,

15:30.681 --> 15:32.766
I wouldn't exactly
cry myself to sleep at night.

15:33.684 --> 15:34.893
Would you, Lisey?

15:34.977 --> 15:36.311
Absolutely not.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.275
Maybe he's dead.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.151
Maybe he is.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.573
If he is, I suppose someone
will eventually stumble on the body.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.451
I don't think they will.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.536
No?

15:53.704 --> 15:55.080
Just a feeling.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.835
Is there something you're not telling me?

16:02.921 --> 16:03.922
Yeah.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.850
Go on and get your pie.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.477
Enjoy it.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.771
Have a good time with your sisters.

16:19.855 --> 16:20.856
Thanks.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.179
I'm on a bool hunt.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.641
Grief is the bool hunt.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.519
You solve all the riddles...

16:59.436 --> 17:01.355
find all the clues...

17:02.814 --> 17:04.316
then you get a prize.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.364
I do remember one thing.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.032
Something Scott said.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.494
It was something about a story.
It was Lisey's story, he said.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.219
My prize is learning how to be alone.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.623
This is it, Mrs. Landon.
You want a last look?

18:02.833 --> 18:06.545
No. I trust you.
I'm sure you've done a good job.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.302
Well, his papers will have
a good home at the Fogler.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.138
Yeah, I'm sure they will. I'm sure.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.311
I've read all of your husband's books,
Mrs. Landon.

18:24.229 --> 18:29.109
Relics, five times.
He got me through a tough year in my life.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.155
I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.035
Thanks.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.661
I need you to tell me
about the shrouded ones.

19:28.335 --> 19:32.339
Because they're not catatonic, are they?
And they're not in comas.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.802
And they're not in the bad.
And they're not gone.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.223
They're dead.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.810
Most of them go on.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.355
But some of them, they stay.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.528
They hold on, at least for a little while.

20:12.546 --> 20:13.547
I know.

20:20.262 --> 20:24.433
I understand. It's okay. It's okay.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.049
This is Darla. Please leave a message.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.133
Hey, sister.

20:59.676 --> 21:00.928
I'm leaving a message now

21:01.011 --> 21:04.306
because I know you always turn
your phone off when you do your yoga.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.644
Anyway, I have to go.

21:10.145 --> 21:13.565
Maybe Amanda filled you in already.
I don't know.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.778
But I'll be back. I mean, I hope I will.

21:20.072 --> 21:23.492
If something happens
with Amanda, though,

21:23.575 --> 21:27.412
just, you know,
get her back on track. Okay?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.958
I know you will.
I can count on you.

21:31.542 --> 21:36.839
Look, I-I don't mean to worry you.
I mean, maybe I have already. I'm sorry.

21:38.841 --> 21:39.842
I love you.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.554
I love you both.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.874
Lisey's story, he said.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.836
But he never dedicated
a book to you, did he?

22:17.838 --> 22:19.256
They were all for me.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.069
-Once upon a time, Lisey...
-Once upon a time, Lisey...

24:47.446 --> 24:51.867
there were two brothers living
on an isolated farm in Pennsylvania.

24:53.118 --> 24:57.581
One year, in the autumn,
the older brother got in the bad.

24:58.457 --> 25:01.835
Which is to say, he became homicidal.

25:04.421 --> 25:08.550
So the boy's father had to kill him.

25:13.931 --> 25:17.684
The younger brother
buried him away on an enchanted hillside.

25:19.269 --> 25:22.272
And life on the isolated farm went on.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.900
But by November...

25:25.359 --> 25:26.735
Where's my sandwich?

25:26.818 --> 25:28.820
Coming, Daddy. It's coming.

25:28.904 --> 25:32.324
It wasn't much of a life
for the two that were left.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.786
America is going to hell,
brothers and sisters.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.705
The entire world is going to hell.
You see it everywhere you go.

25:38.789 --> 25:42.084
Golden calf
and the sound of the pagan flute.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.169
Where's my goddamn fucking sandwich?

25:44.253 --> 25:47.339
I swear to God. If you don't get over here
and give me my goddamn sandwich--

25:47.422 --> 25:49.216
...what's the way home? Jesus!

25:49.299 --> 25:50.300
Jesus!

25:54.763 --> 25:56.765
But there's only true path to heaven.

25:56.849 --> 25:59.393
I am the way.
I am the truth. I am the light!

26:00.686 --> 26:01.687
And there is a way forward,

26:01.770 --> 26:04.064
there's a way to get over,
but you have to give over.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.482
You have to give over on the gambling.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.985
There's mold on it. That's mold.
You see it?

26:08.068 --> 26:12.239
Oh, yeah. I could go
down to Mulie's and get a fresh loaf.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.366
There's money in the can.

26:18.745 --> 26:19.872
You eat it.

26:20.956 --> 26:21.957
Daddy.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.084
"Daddy," what? I said you eat it.

26:25.878 --> 26:27.254
Just a little mold.

26:29.548 --> 26:31.592
Eat it, I said! Eat it! Eat it!

26:35.429 --> 26:39.766
Chew it up. No! Don't you--
Don't you dare. Now swallow it.

26:39.850 --> 26:41.977
If you puke that up,
I'll make you eat it again.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.270
Swallow it.

26:44.438 --> 26:47.441
Now imagine that it's not just your hands,
it's your entire body.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.901
You're down there screaming, "Let me go!"

26:48.984 --> 26:49.985
Good.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.280
All right, now get out of here. I don't...

27:01.038 --> 27:02.080
You hear that?

27:06.752 --> 27:08.670
Don't fuck with me right now.
I know you hear that.

27:08.754 --> 27:10.088
Y-Yes, Daddy.

27:10.172 --> 27:11.798
-You hear that?
-Yes, Daddy.

27:11.882 --> 27:13.634
-You know who that is?
-No.

27:14.927 --> 27:16.220
It's Paul.

27:16.303 --> 27:19.932
-No, Daddy. It's just rats or the wind.
-Yeah, it is. You know it's--

27:20.015 --> 27:24.144
It's not a fucking rat, and it's not
the wind. Don't lie to me. It's Paul.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.563
You told me you were gonna bury him.

27:27.606 --> 27:28.607
Did you bury him?

27:28.690 --> 27:29.691
Yes.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.236
-Deep?
-Yes.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.992
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay. All right.

27:40.077 --> 27:41.286
Get the fuck out of here.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.250
-Can I get a hallelujah?
-Hallelujah!

27:46.333 --> 27:48.460
-Can I get an amen?
-Amen!

27:48.544 --> 27:49.586
Can I get a hallelujah?

27:49.670 --> 27:51.588
Are you going back to work pretty soon?

27:51.672 --> 27:53.090
What, are you writing a book?

27:54.007 --> 27:55.008
No.

27:56.134 --> 28:00.347
No, I'm not going back to work. I'm never
going back to work. Okay? I'm not.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.559
I guess that's your business.
I'll just go down to the store.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.521
Scooter.

28:10.566 --> 28:11.859
Scooter, buddy, come here.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.414
You remember when
you jumped off of that barn?

28:29.376 --> 28:31.378
You were brave that day, son.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.841
-Yes, Daddy.
-Got to be brave.

28:37.092 --> 28:43.849
Because whatever that is,
if it's the wind or if it's a-- a rat

28:43.932 --> 28:48.353
or if it's a ghost or... Paul...

28:49.354 --> 28:51.607
I'm not gonna let them hurt you no more.

28:54.443 --> 28:57.070
I'm not gonna hurt you no more, okay?

28:57.154 --> 28:58.155
Yes.

28:59.740 --> 29:01.241
But you got to be brave.

29:02.201 --> 29:03.202
I will.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.787
This is your time.

29:06.830 --> 29:07.831
I know, Daddy.

29:18.509 --> 29:19.718
Come on, leave me alone.

29:26.350 --> 29:27.935
Motherfuckers!

29:34.066 --> 29:37.778
It went on like that for,
I don't know, another week. Two.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.615
And then one morning,
around nine o'clock...

29:54.503 --> 29:55.879
Daddy, what is that?

29:56.463 --> 29:59.258
It's a fucking car, Scooter.
What does it sound like?

30:00.050 --> 30:04.471
I think it sounds like I'm fucked.
It's over. They know everything.

30:05.848 --> 30:07.850
They're coming for me.
That's what's going on.

30:10.352 --> 30:11.770
It's fucking Frank.

30:11.854 --> 30:14.606
Damn Frank, always getting
into people's business.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.358
-What is he doing here?
-Daddy, don't shoot him.

30:16.441 --> 30:17.734
Come here.

30:17.818 --> 30:21.947
You don't want me to shoot him?
You like reading these goddamn books?

30:22.030 --> 30:25.993
You like reading them? You better
make up a good story. You better.

30:28.078 --> 30:29.913
I will get rid of him.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.290
You do it.

30:41.008 --> 30:44.887
Hello, son.
You must be one of Sparky's boys.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.763
Yes, sir. Sure am.

30:47.306 --> 30:49.766
I'm Frank Halsey,
from the mill. Head of personnel.

30:50.475 --> 30:52.603
Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Scott.

30:53.896 --> 30:55.772
We're kind of missing your father.

30:55.856 --> 30:58.525
His apprentice can't even
change a light bulb without a--

30:59.067 --> 31:00.444
an instruction manual.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.238
He didn't call you from Philly?

31:04.531 --> 31:06.033
No, son, he sure didn't.

31:06.909 --> 31:11.205
Well, he's worried about his sister.

31:12.164 --> 31:16.835
She's got the disease that killed
the famous ball player. From the Yankees.

31:16.919 --> 31:18.504
You know, Lou Gehrig.

31:18.587 --> 31:20.422
Oh, she's got that?

31:22.090 --> 31:24.801
That's a shame. I didn't
even know he had a sister.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.890
Who's watching out for you
and your brother?

31:35.062 --> 31:37.481
Miss Cole, f-from down the road.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.816
She comes by every day.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.487
Besides, Paul knows
four different ways to make meat loaf.

31:44.488 --> 31:45.781
Four, huh?

31:45.864 --> 31:47.741
I'll have to get him to teach my wife.

31:48.659 --> 31:50.702
When's Sparky coming back, do you think?

31:51.954 --> 31:53.747
I-I-I'm not sure.

31:55.624 --> 31:57.584
She can't walk anymore.

31:58.794 --> 32:01.129
And she breathes like this.

32:05.008 --> 32:08.303
Oh, shi-- sh-shin guard.

32:08.387 --> 32:10.430
That's about the worst thing
I've ever heard of.

32:11.014 --> 32:12.015
Yeah.

32:14.935 --> 32:17.813
Well, when he calls in, you get him
to give me a jingle, all right?

32:21.525 --> 32:22.526
Yes, sir.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.945
-Sure will.
-We'll make a plan.

32:25.028 --> 32:29.157
The company can't afford to lose
a fine electrician like Al Landon.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.369
So, before I go...

32:35.414 --> 32:37.958
Here. Go on, take it.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.418
It's from me to you.

32:40.419 --> 32:41.712
And here's one for your brother.

32:44.548 --> 32:47.467
All at once, Lisey,
the strangest thing happened.

32:49.970 --> 32:52.181
I wished my daddy would kill him.

32:54.057 --> 32:55.058
Thank you.

32:55.142 --> 32:58.687
Don't mention it. You just
get him to give me a call.

32:59.271 --> 33:00.814
-All right?
-Yes, sir.

33:01.565 --> 33:02.566
All right.

33:09.198 --> 33:11.825
Listen, I'm very proud of you.

33:12.784 --> 33:17.164
But it's over, Scoot. I'm going down.
He won't be the last.

33:37.601 --> 33:39.895
One of us is gonna die
on this farm, Scoot.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.898
You know it and I know it.

33:46.235 --> 33:49.613
Which one of us is it gonna be? Me or you?

33:52.866 --> 33:54.243
I don't know, Daddy.

34:02.084 --> 34:03.418
I made you a bool hunt.

34:04.837 --> 34:06.839
Just like Paul used to do.

34:06.922 --> 34:11.342
Find a clue, get a prize.
Let's see which one it's gonna be.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.030
Some of them were clues
from the best bool hunt Paul ever made.

34:34.157 --> 34:35.659
Now get the fuck out of here.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.274
You can't--
you can't kill a ghost, you know?

35:50.442 --> 35:51.652
You can't kill a ghost.

36:58.969 --> 37:00.554
I'm sorry, Scotty.

37:02.681 --> 37:04.224
I'm so sorry.

37:06.435 --> 37:07.644
Oh, God.

40:05.072 --> 40:06.615
I tried to take him, Lisey.

40:07.449 --> 40:10.702
The way I took Paul.
It was what he wanted.

40:11.703 --> 40:14.540
I tried and tried, but I couldn't.

41:57.142 --> 42:00.812
The next day,
I went down to Mulie's store and said,

42:00.896 --> 42:04.775
"My daddy took my big brother,
and I guess they up and left me."

42:06.109 --> 42:11.281
Old Mulie took me to the county sheriff,
and the sheriff took me to child welfare.

42:13.617 --> 42:17.704
I thought they'd ask questions
and they'd find him but they never did.

42:24.419 --> 42:26.964
You were the only one
who knew me, babyluv.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.176
The one who gave me light
and knew my darkness.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.720
Now you know the last part of the story.

42:33.804 --> 42:36.223
And telling it has set me free.

42:41.186 --> 42:47.234
You've been the anchor that has held me
in this world, our world, for so long.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.205
You were always saving me, Lisey.

43:00.289 --> 43:03.542
So I left you a bool hunt
so you could save Amanda

43:04.084 --> 43:09.173
and in case someone like Cole, another
Deep Space Cowboy, should come after you.

43:13.886 --> 43:17.764
But mostly, I left it
so you could remember and go on.

43:19.016 --> 43:20.851
-That's your real prize.
-"That's your real prize."

43:22.853 --> 43:26.356
And now that you have all of me,
I know you can.

43:27.566 --> 43:28.817
Kisses.

43:28.901 --> 43:30.611
At least a thousand.

43:35.908 --> 43:36.992
And, Lisey...

43:39.369 --> 43:40.537
I love you.

43:43.957 --> 43:45.626
I love you too, Scott.

43:50.297 --> 43:51.715
I love you too.

45:50.959 --> 45:52.878
I need to see him one more time.

45:58.967 --> 45:59.968
Oh, God.

46:20.948 --> 46:21.949
Keep this.

47:49.536 --> 47:50.662
Scott.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.053
Scott.

48:10.891 --> 48:11.934
Baby.

48:17.397 --> 48:18.649
Babyluv.

48:23.529 --> 48:26.198
When the door closes,
we're eye to eye.

48:27.616 --> 48:29.451
It's just you and me, Lisey.

48:31.161 --> 48:32.371
I love you.

48:33.997 --> 48:35.499
I love you.

48:44.258 --> 48:45.759
What do you think, babyluv?

48:46.343 --> 48:47.803
Will we marry?

48:47.886 --> 48:50.514
Babyluv thinks it's a plan.

48:50.597 --> 48:51.974
You may kiss the bride.

49:00.315 --> 49:02.359
Stories are all I had.

49:04.027 --> 49:05.195
But now I have you.

49:07.698 --> 49:09.324
You're every story.

49:12.786 --> 49:14.496
You're my heart, kiddo.

49:15.414 --> 49:16.707
This is our time now.

49:18.041 --> 49:19.209
You and me.

49:23.755 --> 49:25.757
We can make our own world.

50:02.419 --> 50:03.420
Lisey.

50:05.631 --> 50:06.715
I love you.

51:14.533 --> 51:15.826
Boyfriends and gold!

51:15.909 --> 51:19.037
Boyfriends and gold! Pirates and gold!

51:19.121 --> 51:22.833
Boyfriends and gold! Boyfriends and gold!

51:22.916 --> 51:25.961
Boyfriends and gold! Boyfriends and gold!

51:27.546 --> 51:29.214
-Girls, come here.
-Good Ma!

51:29.298 --> 51:30.299
Dandy Dave!

51:30.382 --> 51:33.051
Hey, girls. We built this
in the garage for you. I hope you like it.

51:33.135 --> 51:34.928
Yeah!

51:36.096 --> 51:38.682
It's the Hollyhocks!
It's the Hollyhocks!

51:39.850 --> 51:41.935
-You guys are like real sailors.
-Thanks!

51:42.019 --> 51:43.270
-Love you, Daddy.
-Thank you!

51:43.353 --> 51:46.607
It's the Hollyhocks!
It's the Hollyhocks!

51:46.690 --> 51:47.900
I can't believe you built this!

51:47.983 --> 51:50.777
Amanda! Lisey! Look at me.

51:50.861 --> 51:52.946
Careful. Looks like there's
a sea monster up there.

51:54.156 --> 51:56.241
Pirates and gold! Pirates and gold!

51:56.325 --> 51:58.368
I love the Hollyhocks, Daddy!

51:58.452 --> 51:59.578
You guys a lot of gold?

51:59.661 --> 52:02.039
We've got an entire treasure chest.

52:02.122 --> 52:06.376
There's a sea monster, but
me and Lisey and Amanda got through it.

52:06.460 --> 52:08.212
-Cheers to the Hollyhocks, girls.
-Cheers, Lisey.

52:08.295 --> 52:09.296
Cheers.

52:43.038 --> 52:44.331
What are you doing here?

52:44.414 --> 52:47.960
We've been here all day.
Are you okay?

52:48.544 --> 52:51.380
Yes. I'm okay.

52:57.010 --> 52:58.470
Is Scott still there?

53:00.180 --> 53:01.765
No, he's gone now.

53:05.352 --> 53:06.562
But I'm not.

53:16.905 --> 53:18.407
Do you wanna get something to eat?

53:19.116 --> 53:22.411
-Sure.
-We could go to Debbie's for dinner.

53:22.494 --> 53:24.246
-Debbie's again?
-Why not?

53:28.667 --> 53:29.668
Okay.

53:31.837 --> 53:33.922
-I'll be there in a minute.
-Okay.

53:52.566 --> 53:53.859
I'll be okay.
