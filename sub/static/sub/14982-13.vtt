00:43.539 --> 00:45.072
Oh, there he is.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.658
Zach Morstein in the flesh,
boy genius inventor

00:47.726 --> 00:49.493
of the latest
get-laid-quick program

00:49.561 --> 00:51.162
for the socially challenged.

00:51.229 --> 00:53.564
What an honor.

00:53.615 --> 00:54.749
Hannah.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.918
Hannah had me sitting
in reception

00:57.002 --> 00:58.920
with my thumb
up my bum

00:59.004 --> 01:02.623
for 6 whole minutes,
which for me 5 minutes too long.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.760
Seekout.

01:05.844 --> 01:08.462
Is that the best name
you could come up with?

01:08.547 --> 01:10.715
Too weird to be a reporter,
too wrinkled to be an attorney.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.183
He says, referring
to the lawsuit

01:12.250 --> 01:14.886
which should by rights
having him changing his underwear

01:14.937 --> 01:16.137
3 times a day.

01:16.221 --> 01:20.224
So you founded the company
with these two,

01:20.275 --> 01:21.642
and then you nobbled
the one on the left,

01:21.727 --> 01:24.478
using some legal loophole,

01:24.563 --> 01:26.981
just before you were
about to make billions.

01:27.065 --> 01:29.884
And you enjoyed
every minute of it.

01:29.952 --> 01:32.570
You read micro-expressions.
I saw an article on that once.

01:32.621 --> 01:35.723
Kyle wouldn't risk his lawsuit
on some half-baked mindreader,

01:35.791 --> 01:37.792
so you must be working
for Claire.

01:39.461 --> 01:42.079
In all the time that you spent
developing this program,

01:42.130 --> 01:45.533
did it ever occur to you
to just buy a girl a drink?

01:45.601 --> 01:48.719
So I just...

01:48.787 --> 01:50.721
Point the phone

01:50.789 --> 01:52.340
at a girl that I fancy,

01:52.424 --> 01:54.809
then I sniff through
her laundry,

01:54.893 --> 01:56.143
just a little bit,

01:56.228 --> 01:58.295
until I figure out
what it takes

01:58.347 --> 01:59.630
to get into her panties.

01:59.681 --> 02:01.098
Excuse me?

02:01.149 --> 02:03.801
Claire and I have been
friends since freshman year.

02:03.852 --> 02:05.937
You can tell her
she's safe.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.491
Define safe.

Original Air Date January 31, 2011

02:41.156 --> 02:43.657
Ok, Claire, you were right.

02:43.742 --> 02:45.709
You were about
to get shafted.

02:45.777 --> 02:47.992
You just told me
Zach said I was safe.

02:48.310 --> 02:49.927
He said it with a smirk
on his face.

02:52.147 --> 02:53.430
It's contempt, that.

02:53.481 --> 02:56.517
So you're saying
he is going to squeeze me out,

02:56.601 --> 02:57.868
just like he did to Kyle.

02:57.936 --> 03:00.170
Well, now that you know
that, you can be ready.

03:00.238 --> 03:01.605
You can fight back.

03:01.673 --> 03:03.490
I don't want to fight Zach.

03:03.575 --> 03:05.442
He's my best friend.

03:05.493 --> 03:06.810
Who you sent me
to suss out.

03:06.861 --> 03:08.612
You do that to all your
best friends, do you?

03:08.663 --> 03:10.531
You may have been close
once, but you're not now.

03:10.615 --> 03:12.833
So what happened?

03:12.917 --> 03:14.752
Things change.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.120
Such as?

03:16.187 --> 03:17.338
He's changed.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.839
And you haven't?

03:18.907 --> 03:21.825
Well, maybe Seekout
has changed both of you.

03:21.876 --> 03:23.093
Business is never easy.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.762
But this isn't just
business, is it?

03:24.829 --> 03:26.680
This is personal.
What'd you do to him?

03:26.765 --> 03:27.631
Nothing.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.650
Well, that's not
what he thinks.

03:29.718 --> 03:31.552
So this is my fault.

03:31.636 --> 03:34.888
Are you asking
or are you saying?

03:37.826 --> 03:38.826
Cal.

03:38.893 --> 03:39.693
What?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.195
Come on.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.930
That's all right, love.
Give me time.

03:42.998 --> 03:44.848
I'm very bloody good
at this.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.368
Thank you for your help.

03:47.452 --> 03:48.452
You're welcome.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.904
Gillian...

03:50.989 --> 03:53.123
Thank you for your help.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.209
Claire. I did try
to warn you.

03:55.293 --> 03:57.211
And I thought
we were best friends.

03:57.868 --> 03:59.402
Thank you.

04:00.859 --> 04:03.729
I'm so sorry this is
happening to you, Claire.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.705
Don't be. I own part of
a billion-dollar company

04:06.789 --> 04:08.523
and according to
Dr. Lightman,

04:08.574 --> 04:11.493
the smartest person I know
is planning to take it from me.

04:11.544 --> 04:12.627
You're welcome.

04:12.695 --> 04:14.796
At least now I know
the intelligent move

04:14.864 --> 04:16.964
is to hire
the best lawyer I can.

04:17.033 --> 04:19.668
I'll call you later.

04:21.202 --> 04:22.971
"Shafted"?

04:23.039 --> 04:26.207
I ask you to be gentle
and you open with "shafted"?

04:26.259 --> 04:27.726
I thought I was being
exceptionally gentle.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.894
You should have seen
the bastard's face.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.479
I'm just saying,
as her therapist--

04:30.546 --> 04:32.481
ex-therapist.
You work with me now.

04:32.548 --> 04:34.483
This is that personal
to you, is it?

04:34.550 --> 04:37.019
Sound like anyone you know?

04:37.070 --> 04:39.021
No, hang on.
No, it'll come to me.

04:39.072 --> 04:40.856
It's on the tip
of my tongue.

04:40.907 --> 04:42.223
I'm so glad
I work with you now,

04:42.275 --> 04:44.276
really, for Claire's
sake, because it puts me

04:44.360 --> 04:45.994
in a much better position
to protect her

04:46.062 --> 04:47.195
from this Zach person.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.081
And you can do that
without prejudice, can you?

04:49.165 --> 04:51.399
Now you're just being silly.

04:52.568 --> 04:54.169
The day Kyle Putnam
was fired,

04:54.236 --> 04:57.172
his shares were diluted
and his stake in the company

04:57.239 --> 04:59.291
went from 25% to 2.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.625
Kyle sued Zach
the next day.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.010
He says that Seekout
was his idea

05:02.078 --> 05:03.712
and Zach took
all the credit.

05:03.763 --> 05:06.247
Best friends
at each other's throats

05:06.299 --> 05:08.416
with Claire caught
in the middle.

05:08.468 --> 05:10.852
Well, she picked a side
pretty quickly.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.355
Everything I've read says
she's a loyal member of team Zach.

05:13.422 --> 05:14.973
You don't know her.

05:16.726 --> 05:19.694
So I take it Claire is like
family or something?

05:19.762 --> 05:21.763
She's a paying client.

05:22.782 --> 05:24.232
Don't look at me like that.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.618
You know, we're on
your side, Foster.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.120
Good.

05:28.204 --> 05:29.871
Stop pushing, ok?

05:29.939 --> 05:31.890
According to Lightman,
and I'm just saying,

05:31.958 --> 05:33.775
Claire is hiding something.

05:33.826 --> 05:35.127
She's torn between
two friends.

05:35.211 --> 05:36.611
Friends mean
the world to Claire.

05:36.662 --> 05:39.464
I mean, if Kyle asked
for her help, she'd give it.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.816
So this diluted shares thing,

05:40.883 --> 05:42.617
I mean, could Zach
do that to Claire, too?

05:42.668 --> 05:44.169
It depends on
her contract.

05:44.253 --> 05:45.387
Which we don't have.

05:45.455 --> 05:48.640
Yeah, which is weird,
since she hired us.

05:48.708 --> 05:51.143
She did hire us, right?

05:51.227 --> 05:52.561
You're doing it again.

05:52.628 --> 05:54.846
Actually, to be fair, you're
doing that thing you hate

05:54.931 --> 05:58.350
when Lightman does it--
a personal favor on company time.

06:02.171 --> 06:03.855
Dr. Lightman?

06:30.016 --> 06:32.834
Screw you.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.637
Where are you going?

06:38.524 --> 06:40.859
Marqui Turner.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.727
It's key. Just key.

06:42.812 --> 06:44.179
Street name?

06:44.230 --> 06:46.148
You have Ria send me
into your empty office

06:46.199 --> 06:48.316
for an interview,
just so happen to have 100 bucks

06:48.367 --> 06:50.068
lying around
as some kind of test?

06:50.153 --> 06:52.187
- You was gonna take it.
- But I didn't.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.455
That's 'cause you knew
I was watching you.

06:53.522 --> 06:55.857
No, 'cause I'm smarter
than that.

06:57.493 --> 07:00.328
So, are you Ria's
charity case, are you?

07:00.379 --> 07:01.746
Come on, man,
don't knock charity.

07:01.831 --> 07:02.864
Who's knocking it?

07:02.932 --> 07:04.749
Was a time once
where I come from,

07:04.834 --> 07:06.134
all I had was charity.

07:06.202 --> 07:07.586
She warned me about you.

07:07.670 --> 07:08.870
Is this the interview?

07:08.921 --> 07:11.256
So is that why
you're here, then,

07:11.324 --> 07:12.974
a little latina action?

07:13.809 --> 07:15.727
Yeah, that, and a job.

07:15.795 --> 07:16.928
What kind of job?

07:17.013 --> 07:18.196
One that pays.

07:18.264 --> 07:20.381
Or makes an honest man
out of you.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.267
Come on, now,
did I say that?

07:23.853 --> 07:25.437
Here.

07:27.190 --> 07:29.107
What you want me
to do with this?

07:29.192 --> 07:32.611
Follow him.
You work it out.

07:35.898 --> 07:37.899
Expenses.

07:49.195 --> 07:51.313
Ohh...

07:51.380 --> 07:52.631
Ohh!

07:52.698 --> 07:55.150
Ohh...

08:09.198 --> 08:10.982
Heart problem?

08:11.067 --> 08:12.417
More like lungs.

08:12.485 --> 08:14.269
We just ran 3 miles.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.787
What are you doing
to my daughter, Liam?

08:15.871 --> 08:17.739
He's about to stretch
my hamstrings.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.291
This is the best way.

08:20.576 --> 08:22.460
How's that feel, Em?

08:22.545 --> 08:23.628
Deep breaths.

08:23.713 --> 08:25.413
Oh, yeah!

08:25.464 --> 08:27.249
Ohh!

08:27.300 --> 08:28.850
Ohh!

08:28.918 --> 08:30.218
Ohh...

08:30.286 --> 08:31.886
How you doin', dad?

08:31.954 --> 08:33.922
Where's my gun?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.807
Come on, he has to do this
or else I'll get stiff.

08:35.875 --> 08:38.426
Other leg.

08:39.128 --> 08:41.580
I'll get it, son.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.481
Uh--dad, come on,
you're hurting me.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.799
No pain, no gain,
what, Liam?

08:44.850 --> 08:45.967
Come on, I'm not a turkey.

08:46.018 --> 08:47.635
You're not doing it right,
Dr. Lightman.

08:47.687 --> 08:49.137
I'll take over.

08:50.472 --> 08:52.407
Oh, yeah.

08:52.474 --> 08:54.025
Oh, just like that.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.493
Oh, yeah!

08:55.578 --> 08:58.647
Ohh! Ohh...Ohh...

09:00.082 --> 09:02.250
Ohh!

09:03.652 --> 09:07.756
You have no idea
how happy I am you called, Foster.

09:07.823 --> 09:08.990
Ohh...

09:09.041 --> 09:11.960
Slow down, darling.

09:15.998 --> 09:18.333
I was too late.

09:18.384 --> 09:22.020
I just came--came by
to check on her.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.173
I tried to save her...

09:25.224 --> 09:27.108
Ok, darling.
There you go.

09:27.176 --> 09:29.778
Thank you.

09:35.134 --> 09:37.268
Stay here, love.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.165
Here.

10:02.432 --> 10:04.984
You catch a lot of criminals
in that getup, do you?

10:05.068 --> 10:07.336
Foster? You ok?

10:07.404 --> 10:09.872
You called her?

10:09.939 --> 10:12.742
Shock.

10:12.793 --> 10:14.660
Drink the water.

10:16.163 --> 10:18.331
40 minutes it took you
to get here.

10:18.415 --> 10:20.783
I was off duty
and it's a big city.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.117
What, nice date, was it?

10:22.169 --> 10:23.552
You got a problem
with that?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.588
No, I got a problem
with a young girl's just been killed

10:25.639 --> 10:28.224
and the floor's just
fallen out of Gill's world.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.476
Which is why I got here
as fast as I could,

10:30.560 --> 10:33.896
to add this homicide to the pile
of 5 others that I have on my desk.

10:33.964 --> 10:37.533
Yeah. You're the one
that's having a rough night.

10:44.641 --> 10:46.909
And I noticed the door was--

10:46.976 --> 10:50.830
was open, you know,
it was cracked

10:50.914 --> 10:53.199
just a little. Uh...

10:53.266 --> 10:55.301
So I--I went in.

10:55.369 --> 10:57.236
She was still breathing.

10:57.304 --> 11:00.740
Um, I took my scarf and I--

11:00.807 --> 11:04.026
and I put, uh,
pressure on the wound,

11:04.094 --> 11:09.348
and it got soaked
really fast.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.517
So then I called 911.

11:11.601 --> 11:15.554
Then, uh, and then
I called you.

11:15.622 --> 11:18.357
And then I kept my hands there

11:18.442 --> 11:22.228
for what felt like...

11:22.312 --> 11:26.599
Forever, until
the paramedics arrived.

11:26.666 --> 11:29.869
And was anyone there
when you arrived, uh,

11:29.936 --> 11:32.071
outside maybe?

11:32.155 --> 11:34.840
No, I don't think so,
but I wasn't...

11:37.044 --> 11:40.646
You know, I--I didn't, uh,

11:40.714 --> 11:43.049
know that Claire
had been hurt,

11:43.133 --> 11:46.034
so I wasn't...

11:46.086 --> 11:48.387
I wasn't...

11:48.455 --> 11:51.557
Looking for that.

11:52.592 --> 11:54.760
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Gillian.

11:54.845 --> 11:57.546
I'll take that cup
of coffee now, please.

12:02.486 --> 12:05.220
Isn't that Kyle?

12:05.272 --> 12:07.656
You should take
Dr. Foster home now.

12:07.724 --> 12:10.226
He's the one suing
Zach Morstein.

12:10.293 --> 12:11.644
What's he doing here?

12:11.711 --> 12:13.195
The Seekout app
on Claire's phone

12:13.263 --> 12:15.664
puts Kyle at her apartment
at the time of the murder.

12:15.732 --> 12:17.116
He's not your killer.
If he was your killer,

12:17.200 --> 12:18.434
he'd have guilt all over him.

12:18.502 --> 12:20.536
He's scared. He's confused.

12:20.587 --> 12:22.905
Maybe he's hiding the guilt.

12:22.956 --> 12:26.074
The nearest cell tower
also puts Kyle at Claire's apartment.

12:26.126 --> 12:28.744
Our techs say it's
impossible to fake.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.763
Your techs, have they met
Zach Morstein?

12:30.847 --> 12:33.966
I go with the evidence
I've got. That's my job.

12:34.935 --> 12:37.019
Do cops have
good health insurance?

12:37.086 --> 12:38.804
What?
For hearing loss.

12:38.889 --> 12:41.440
Listen to me,
very carefully.

12:41.508 --> 12:43.309
That is not your killer.

12:43.393 --> 12:47.146
Do you know what half a billion dollars
worth of angry feels like?

12:54.905 --> 12:56.322
Can we go now?

12:56.406 --> 12:57.907
Home?

12:57.958 --> 13:00.292
Seriously?

13:00.377 --> 13:03.129
That's my girl.

13:11.087 --> 13:13.506
Do you ever
take a night off?

13:13.590 --> 13:16.725
Claire would be touched
to know how much she meant to you.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.727
Do you know who I am?

13:18.795 --> 13:19.929
Who I was to Claire?

13:19.980 --> 13:23.849
You're a shrink and Claire
had emotional problems.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.768
Inflection went down
when you said her name.

13:25.819 --> 13:26.852
You want control.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.854
Ah. Vocal stress
analysis. Awesome.

13:28.939 --> 13:31.240
Which one of you
reads palms?

13:31.307 --> 13:32.741
I bet yours are sweaty.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.376
And hairy.

13:34.444 --> 13:37.446
Well, maybe this
was a suicide.

13:37.497 --> 13:39.331
And maybe you killed her.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.167
I'm guessing you have
trust issues.

13:41.251 --> 13:42.701
Well, it's actually
not really a guess,

13:42.786 --> 13:44.152
seeing as I know
you keep googling

13:44.204 --> 13:46.288
your daughter's
boyfriend Liam.

13:47.591 --> 13:50.392
Claire was your best friend.

13:50.460 --> 13:54.547
But she was hiding
something from you.

13:54.631 --> 13:56.632
I just love watching
your little brain work.

13:56.683 --> 13:58.384
It's adorable.

13:58.468 --> 13:59.969
If I was gonna
kill anyone,

14:00.020 --> 14:02.054
wouldn't I
just kill Kyle?

14:02.122 --> 14:03.489
The man was taking you
to court.

14:03.557 --> 14:04.773
That would make you
a prime suspect.

14:04.841 --> 14:06.475
Ah, but
I'm a super genius.

14:06.526 --> 14:09.344
I would just kill him
and frame someone else.

14:09.396 --> 14:11.847
Or is that sounding
a little farfetched?

14:11.915 --> 14:13.649
Claire was screwing you.

14:13.700 --> 14:14.817
No, I don't mean like that.

14:14.868 --> 14:16.351
We both know you
you don't even got the guts

14:16.403 --> 14:17.503
to buy a girl a drink.

14:17.571 --> 14:20.856
I mean she was screwing you
business-wise.

14:20.907 --> 14:22.625
Yeah.

14:22.692 --> 14:25.411
I mean like that.

14:25.495 --> 14:28.781
She had a secret,
and you know it.

14:28.848 --> 14:30.532
Interesting.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.801
If you knew exactly
what she was hiding,

14:32.869 --> 14:34.536
but you don't.

14:35.906 --> 14:38.257
This face-reading thing
really works, huh?

14:38.341 --> 14:42.144
You know, I met a little boy once.
He was about 10.

14:42.211 --> 14:44.263
He didn't have to say
anything.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.382
I knew just what he did.

14:47.434 --> 14:50.436
His eyebrows
were raised up,

14:50.520 --> 14:53.889
just like yours are now,
and his jaw was slack.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.408
He couldn't believe
what he'd just gone and done.

14:56.476 --> 15:00.296
You are so bloody clever,

15:00.363 --> 15:03.198
you can figure out
just about anything.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.500
Except people.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.670
Which is what
pisses you off the most.

15:07.737 --> 15:09.922
Claire turned on you,

15:10.006 --> 15:11.507
and just like
that little boy,

15:11.574 --> 15:12.841
you threw a wobbler.

15:12.909 --> 15:17.529
But instead of kicking
the family cat like him,

15:17.597 --> 15:21.934
you killed your best friend.

15:25.722 --> 15:29.358
Hackers in China tried to take
down our servers last year.

15:29.425 --> 15:31.093
They failed.

15:31.144 --> 15:33.195
They broke into Google,

15:33.262 --> 15:36.098
but they couldn't beat my code.

15:36.149 --> 15:37.533
If I was going to
kill anyone,

15:37.600 --> 15:39.952
it would be
just like my programs.

15:40.036 --> 15:42.855
Totally airtight.

15:43.757 --> 15:45.624
That's just one statement

15:45.709 --> 15:47.793
saying that Seekout's
entirely my creation

15:47.877 --> 15:50.329
and Kyle Putnam
is due nothing.

15:55.284 --> 15:57.236
Claire signed this
2 days ago.

15:58.672 --> 16:00.689
So, you see,
Claire didn't turn on me.

16:00.757 --> 16:02.791
She wasn't going
to help Kyle.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.010
Unlike you and your cat,

16:05.095 --> 16:08.230
I had no reason
to kill her.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.567
Did you know

16:11.634 --> 16:15.821
that Einstein
couldn't do maths?

16:15.889 --> 16:17.506
Every genius has a weakness,

16:17.574 --> 16:18.824
genius.

16:35.388 --> 16:38.040
You been to the doctor's yet,

16:38.053 --> 16:39.770
about your ears?

16:39.787 --> 16:42.338
Kyle called Claire
3 times the day she was murdered.

16:42.406 --> 16:43.539
Why would he do that?

16:43.607 --> 16:45.324
And not for nothing,
but when I got him

16:45.376 --> 16:48.261
in that interview room,
he looked pretty guilty to me.

16:48.328 --> 16:51.330
Well, if you tell someone
often enough

16:51.382 --> 16:53.433
that they're guilty, right,

16:53.500 --> 16:56.168
pretty soon they're gonna
start looking guilty, don't you think?

16:56.220 --> 16:57.670
I'm right about him.

16:57.721 --> 17:00.339
Well, then, shouldn't you
be out there feeling his collar,

17:00.391 --> 17:03.226
instead of standing here
flirting with me?

17:03.310 --> 17:04.844
Feeling his collar?

17:04.895 --> 17:06.945
Arresting him.

17:07.013 --> 17:10.182
Or, just to cover
your ass,

17:10.233 --> 17:12.201
you could get Zach
and Kyle

17:12.286 --> 17:13.653
and put them in the cube.

17:13.704 --> 17:15.872
Sounds like a hot date
to me.

17:15.955 --> 17:18.407
Well, Kyle is hiding behind
the great wall of lawyers.

17:18.492 --> 17:21.193
And as for Zach, I can't
just haul people in here

17:21.244 --> 17:23.313
and accuse them of murder
without a good reason.

17:23.380 --> 17:26.833
I'm telling you,
he did it.

17:26.884 --> 17:29.869
You and Foster went
through a lot last night.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.505
You got an ax to grind here
and I understand that.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.841
But I'm gonna need
your help with this one.

17:34.892 --> 17:38.311
If you need mine,
just ask.

17:39.379 --> 17:43.333
Is it like a ringing noise
in your ears?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.985
Do want me to take a look
at it for you?

17:47.788 --> 17:49.555
I am a doctor, you know.

17:59.933 --> 18:01.167
Can I help you?

18:01.235 --> 18:03.503
Depends.
You got any mustard?

18:03.570 --> 18:06.989
That's a first edition
from Lightman's office.

18:07.057 --> 18:08.791
Why do people do that?

18:08.876 --> 18:10.209
Do what?

18:10.260 --> 18:11.310
Say, "can I help you?"

18:11.378 --> 18:13.863
When you really mean,
"who the hell are you?"

18:13.931 --> 18:15.181
Mustard?

18:15.248 --> 18:17.600
Fridge.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.354
And I know who you are.

18:21.421 --> 18:22.688
Well, who are you?

18:22.756 --> 18:24.807
Loker. Eli.

18:24.892 --> 18:25.975
Door.

18:26.060 --> 18:28.044
Mm.

18:29.913 --> 18:31.731
Did Lightman hire you?

18:31.782 --> 18:33.866
He gave me 100 bucks.

18:33.934 --> 18:36.486
For what?

18:36.570 --> 18:38.437
Charity.

18:38.489 --> 18:40.807
Doesn't really
sound like Lightman.

18:40.874 --> 18:43.609
What's he got you
doing?

18:51.218 --> 18:54.587
I need to know what you and Torres
got from Zach's employees.

18:54.638 --> 18:55.955
We are scouring the web.

18:56.006 --> 18:58.474
We're looking for anyone who
Zach may have recently fired,

18:58.559 --> 19:00.309
and maybe one of those people
will know something

19:00.394 --> 19:02.478
about the secret
between Zach and Claire.

19:02.563 --> 19:04.063
Kyle knows more
about Zach and Claire than anyone.

19:04.131 --> 19:05.848
We just need
to get him talking.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.850
You gonna clean that up?

19:07.935 --> 19:09.602
That's not my mess.

19:09.653 --> 19:13.139
So you're not gonna
clean it up, then.

19:29.623 --> 19:32.074
Nice place, this.

19:32.142 --> 19:34.493
Good coffee, free wifi,
no cellmates.

19:34.545 --> 19:37.880
Relax. Calm down.
I'm on your side.

19:37.965 --> 19:41.234
So, did you really call Claire
the day she was killed?

19:41.301 --> 19:43.386
Or did Zach plant
that evidence, too?

19:43.470 --> 19:45.805
What did you talk about?

19:45.856 --> 19:49.175
I'm not saying anything
without my attorneys.

19:49.226 --> 19:50.893
Well, then you're screwed,
aren't you?

19:50.978 --> 19:53.146
What do you mean?

19:53.197 --> 19:54.730
When I was about 10,
my dad accused me

19:54.815 --> 19:57.016
of smoking one of
his cheap cigars.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.368
He said if I come clean,

19:59.453 --> 20:00.870
he'd forget about it.

20:00.954 --> 20:03.039
So I told him that I did it,

20:03.123 --> 20:06.042
and the bastard
walloped me anyway.

20:06.126 --> 20:08.911
I mean, he really
went to town on me.

20:08.996 --> 20:10.997
What's this have to do
with my lawyers?

20:11.048 --> 20:12.331
Nothing. I mean,
they're great,

20:12.382 --> 20:14.634
if you're negotiating
for 25% of the company,

20:14.701 --> 20:19.055
but 25% of a life sentence
for a crime you didn't commit...

20:19.139 --> 20:22.758
Well, then, you're getting
walloped anyway, aren't you?

20:22.826 --> 20:26.229
You trying
to clear your name?

20:29.766 --> 20:31.884
When we were in college,

20:31.935 --> 20:34.570
Zach liked this girl,
but he was too shy to talk to her,

20:34.655 --> 20:36.906
so he hacked
the local cell network

20:36.990 --> 20:39.242
and read her texts to
try to get to know her.

20:39.326 --> 20:42.845
Now, these programs, they
left these hidden files,

20:42.913 --> 20:45.331
like breadcrumbs.

20:45.398 --> 20:47.033
Now, if Zach left these
same files last night.

20:47.084 --> 20:49.085
I can prove
that he's framing me.

20:51.889 --> 20:54.340
No power at home?

20:54.407 --> 20:58.628
Plenty. It's just that
the news vans are a little distracting.

20:58.695 --> 21:00.930
Why'd you call her?

21:01.014 --> 21:03.883
We were still friends.

21:03.934 --> 21:06.552
I heard Zach was pissed
after your visit.

21:06.603 --> 21:10.423
I just...I wanted
to make sure she was ok.

21:11.725 --> 21:14.310
Ok.

21:14.394 --> 21:16.729
I got power at my office.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.097
And wifi.

21:18.148 --> 21:20.566
No news vans, though.

21:20.617 --> 21:22.018
Come on.

21:22.085 --> 21:25.321
By the way,
I did smoke that cigar.

21:25.405 --> 21:26.906
Just saying.

21:45.125 --> 21:49.211
So...What are you
looking for, Detective?

21:49.279 --> 21:51.180
Not exactly sure yet.

21:51.265 --> 21:54.267
I'm still waiting on
the autopsy report.

21:54.318 --> 21:57.403
Some people read faces,
I read crime scenes.

21:57.470 --> 21:59.188
Oh, yeah?

21:59.273 --> 22:02.358
School books
in a million-dollar penthouse.

22:02.442 --> 22:05.661
A little girl
making grown-up money.

22:10.317 --> 22:11.867
Oi.

22:14.538 --> 22:17.323
You read this here,
Detective?

22:20.460 --> 22:22.895
How do you reckon

22:22.963 --> 22:27.516
grandma ended up
face-down by the sofa?

22:28.485 --> 22:30.803
Knocked over
in the struggle.

22:32.939 --> 22:33.873
Wh--

22:33.940 --> 22:34.940
ok...

22:35.008 --> 22:38.744
What? What, in the middle
of a crime scene?

22:38.812 --> 22:39.945
Foster would kill me.

22:40.013 --> 22:41.480
Not if you don't tell her.

22:41.548 --> 22:42.965
Seriously?

22:43.033 --> 22:44.734
Are you smoking crack?

22:44.818 --> 22:45.885
All right, yeah.

22:45.952 --> 22:48.654
No. Yeah.

22:48.705 --> 22:49.705
Bear with me.

22:49.790 --> 22:51.991
You're gonna love
this one.

22:55.912 --> 22:57.363
You're Claire.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.138
Claire had sex
before she was killed.

23:06.206 --> 23:08.194
Oh, my God, you're good.

23:30.363 --> 23:32.314
Well, aren't you
the lady-killer.

23:32.365 --> 23:35.651
Are you familiar with
Einstein's definition of insanity?

23:35.702 --> 23:38.487
Yep. Doing the same thing
over and over again

23:38.555 --> 23:40.005
and expecting
different results.

23:40.090 --> 23:41.657
It's kind of like you,
really,

23:41.708 --> 23:44.627
coming in here,
night after night,

23:44.678 --> 23:46.645
thinking that
this'll be the night

23:46.713 --> 23:47.847
you finally belong.

23:47.931 --> 23:52.501
Well, actually,
I'm surrounded by friends.

23:54.020 --> 23:57.506
And ignoring the people
right next to you.

23:57.557 --> 23:59.291
But they're not ignoring me.

23:59.359 --> 24:01.060
Oh, yeah.
You're a young billionaire.

24:01.144 --> 24:03.045
It's open season.

24:03.113 --> 24:04.864
Especially now you're single.

24:04.948 --> 24:07.283
I was wondering how long
it was gonna take you

24:07.350 --> 24:08.684
to land on sex as a motive.

24:08.735 --> 24:10.870
It wasn't my idea.
I got it from Claire.

24:10.954 --> 24:14.290
There's a proportional relationship
between how crazy a girl is

24:14.357 --> 24:17.209
and how slutty she is.
Claire had been in therapy for years.

24:17.294 --> 24:18.794
You do the math.

24:18.862 --> 24:20.796
So the whore
had it coming.

24:20.864 --> 24:23.549
And Claire was so lucky
to have you in her life.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.284
You know who's really nuts?

24:25.352 --> 24:26.886
Therapists.

24:26.970 --> 24:30.005
Your friend Foster
must be a real hellcat.

24:33.710 --> 24:35.844
All that anger

24:35.896 --> 24:39.181
just over sex.

24:39.232 --> 24:42.234
You're Freud's wet dream,
you are.

24:44.721 --> 24:47.406
Take a good long look,
Lightman.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.659
Claire and I
were best friends.

24:50.727 --> 24:53.862
Nothing more. Period.

24:53.914 --> 24:56.165
Well, someone
had sex with her

24:56.233 --> 24:58.617
before she was killed.

24:58.702 --> 25:00.169
It wasn't me.

25:00.236 --> 25:01.787
I had nothing
to do with this.

25:01.871 --> 25:03.088
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

25:03.173 --> 25:04.707
I have a funeral
to attend in the morning

25:04.758 --> 25:07.426
and I'd really like
to get drunk first.

25:24.578 --> 25:26.128
Morning, sunshine.

25:26.196 --> 25:28.297
Oh. Hey.

25:28.364 --> 25:31.033
Uh, I want to show
you something.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.218
Why didn't you just tell us
about you and Claire?

25:33.286 --> 25:34.820
What?

25:34.888 --> 25:35.821
Claire.

25:35.889 --> 25:37.740
You were sleeping with her,
weren't you?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.375
No, I was not.

25:39.442 --> 25:41.827
Was not.

25:41.911 --> 25:43.445
As opposed to wasn't.

25:43.496 --> 25:45.781
Extra emphasis
to sell the lie.

25:45.832 --> 25:47.333
I can't talk about this.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.752
Why? Because you're
the one who killed her?

25:49.803 --> 25:52.755
No.

25:52.806 --> 25:55.608
I'm the one that
found her, remember?

25:55.675 --> 25:57.710
And I watched her choke

25:57.777 --> 25:59.678
while I tried to stop
the bleeding.

25:59.763 --> 26:01.013
Please...

26:01.097 --> 26:04.933
But the hole
that the knife made...

26:04.985 --> 26:07.486
It was just too big.

26:08.438 --> 26:11.323
I didn't kill her.

26:11.391 --> 26:12.908
I swear.

26:18.498 --> 26:21.617
Now tell me
you didn't love her.

26:27.874 --> 26:30.759
Now, why would he
keep that a secret?

26:30.827 --> 26:32.494
You got me.

26:32.545 --> 26:33.995
Claire was smart, funny,

26:34.047 --> 26:35.347
beautiful.

26:35.432 --> 26:38.600
I guess she just didn't
mean that much to you.

26:38.668 --> 26:40.168
You don't know Zach.

26:40.220 --> 26:42.604
He invades your life.
He controls everything.

26:42.672 --> 26:43.889
Then why were you
friends with him?

26:43.973 --> 26:46.007
You don't decide
to be friends with Zach.

26:46.059 --> 26:47.342
He decides for you.

26:47.394 --> 26:49.511
Being friends with Zach
has its benefits.

26:49.562 --> 26:51.714
Nice watch, by the way.

26:53.867 --> 26:56.201
When Claire and I...

26:56.269 --> 26:59.471
Started, we knew
that Zach would freak,

26:59.539 --> 27:01.907
so we agreed to keep it
a secret.

27:01.991 --> 27:04.376
Zach found out somehow.

27:04.444 --> 27:05.627
You know this for a fact?

27:05.695 --> 27:07.195
He never said a word.

27:07.247 --> 27:09.898
But one day he trusted me
and the next day I was out.

27:09.966 --> 27:11.533
It looked like Claire
was next.

27:11.584 --> 27:14.503
All right, you need to
tell someone this, Kyle.

27:14.554 --> 27:15.971
The fact that I was
sleeping with her

27:16.039 --> 27:17.973
only makes me look
more guilty.

27:20.176 --> 27:22.594
Look, I found the breadcrumbs,
ok? I think so.

27:22.679 --> 27:24.212
I just need to run
a few more tests.

27:24.264 --> 27:26.548
All right, run with it.

27:27.901 --> 27:29.318
Stop.

27:29.385 --> 27:30.652
Go back.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.554
You totally lost me.

27:32.605 --> 27:34.823
These were the invisibles
that Zach left.

27:34.891 --> 27:36.658
If we can just trace them
back to his IP.

27:36.726 --> 27:37.726
That sounds like
a doddle.

27:37.777 --> 27:39.227
What's an invisible?

27:39.279 --> 27:40.662
It's like a hidden file.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.831
Well, actually, these are
more like ghost files.

27:42.899 --> 27:45.000
Does anyone here
speak english?

27:47.737 --> 27:48.837
No!

27:48.905 --> 27:50.005
What the hell did you do?

27:50.072 --> 27:52.174
It's not me, it's Zach.
He planted a logic bomb.

27:52.241 --> 27:54.259
You set off a virus
in my network?

27:54.344 --> 27:55.127
What's it doing now?

27:55.211 --> 27:56.929
It's deleting everything.

27:57.013 --> 27:59.080
Your files, mine,
the damn breadcrumbs.

28:01.918 --> 28:03.435
No matter how smart
you think you are,

28:03.520 --> 28:05.086
Zach is always smarter.

28:05.138 --> 28:06.288
I can trace the virus.

28:06.356 --> 28:07.773
I can prove
that he destroyed evidence.

28:07.857 --> 28:09.108
No, don't bother.

28:09.192 --> 28:10.943
It's bound to be perfect.

28:11.027 --> 28:12.811
Totally airtight.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.144
I just lost the only proof
that Zach framed me.

28:18.244 --> 28:19.327
What am I supposed to do?

28:19.412 --> 28:21.363
Well, Mexico is nice.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.201
Shazzer.

28:27.570 --> 28:30.188
I have a warrant
for Kyle Putnam's arrest.

28:33.242 --> 28:35.844
So if you happen to see him,

28:35.928 --> 28:39.047
will you tell him
to turn himself in?

28:40.766 --> 28:42.267
Oi.

28:42.334 --> 28:44.102
Detective.

28:56.282 --> 29:00.035
All right, Detective.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.287
Why are we all here
at this late hour?

29:02.354 --> 29:06.574
Hmm? Is my client
being investigated?

29:06.659 --> 29:09.461
For the murder, no.

29:09.528 --> 29:12.914
I just wanted to talk
to Claire's best friend.

29:12.999 --> 29:14.666
I was hoping you could help.

29:14.717 --> 29:15.951
Anything I can do.

29:16.018 --> 29:18.753
Do you know if Claire
was seeing anyone?

29:18.838 --> 29:21.790
I think she was involved
with Kyle.

29:21.857 --> 29:23.074
Really?

29:23.142 --> 29:25.143
'Cause I can't find
any proof of that.

29:25.211 --> 29:28.063
Well, I'm sure if you
check phone records,

29:28.147 --> 29:30.181
ims, texts, you know.

29:30.232 --> 29:31.766
So how did you
know about this?

29:31.834 --> 29:35.186
Did you seem them kissing?
Holding hands?

29:35.254 --> 29:39.107
Did Claire ever actually tell you
that she was sleeping with Kyle?

29:42.361 --> 29:45.730
It was just office gossip.

29:45.781 --> 29:49.701
I should have mentioned it earlier,
but I didn't want to tarnish Claire's memory

29:49.752 --> 29:51.503
with a rumor.

29:52.321 --> 29:54.405
Are we done here?

29:55.708 --> 29:57.826
Well, everything that I've
been able to find thus far,

29:57.893 --> 30:00.045
it indicates that
they were only friends.

30:00.112 --> 30:02.998
I need some kind
of hard physical evidence.

30:03.065 --> 30:06.835
I have to prove that there was
something else or Kyle will walk.

30:23.119 --> 30:26.905
All work and no play
makes Zach a crashing bore.

30:26.956 --> 30:27.822
Something like that.

30:27.907 --> 30:30.441
You're on private property.

30:33.779 --> 30:35.413
While you're at it,

30:35.464 --> 30:38.083
you might want to tell them
where you got those.

30:38.134 --> 30:44.455
They're private messages
between Kyle and Claire, right?

30:44.507 --> 30:46.591
You don't know
what you saw.

30:47.643 --> 30:48.676
Kyle does.

30:48.761 --> 30:51.396
That's the evidence
Wallowski needs.

30:51.463 --> 30:55.100
Patched in your machine,
Zach.

30:55.151 --> 30:56.568
You were spying on us.

30:56.635 --> 30:58.803
Kyle, isn't there a warrant
out for your arrest?

30:58.854 --> 31:01.773
How did you even find these?
They were anonymous accounts.

31:01.824 --> 31:03.324
Created to hid your affair.

31:03.409 --> 31:05.660
These prove that
you were sleeping with her.

31:05.745 --> 31:07.028
And the fact
that you hacked in

31:07.113 --> 31:09.114
proves that you knew
about it.

31:09.165 --> 31:12.000
So what was the point?
I mean, really?

31:12.084 --> 31:14.369
You're gonna leak those to Wallowski,
put him away for good, is that it?

31:14.453 --> 31:16.671
Well, that's very clever.

31:16.756 --> 31:19.841
You just gave us
your motive, Einstein.

31:19.925 --> 31:21.626
I have signed documents

31:21.677 --> 31:24.429
that prove Claire wasn't
helping him with the lawsuit.

31:24.496 --> 31:26.347
She could do him
in the break room for all I care.

31:26.432 --> 31:29.434
But you do care,
don't you?

31:29.501 --> 31:31.803
'Cause you loved her.

31:31.854 --> 31:34.606
Claire and I
were just friends.

31:34.673 --> 31:36.724
You wanted more
than just a friendship.

31:36.809 --> 31:40.445
I mean, all--
all those brains, right?

31:40.512 --> 31:42.981
Claire hanson breaks
your little heart.

31:43.032 --> 31:45.400
I'm worth a billion dollars.

31:45.484 --> 31:47.786
Women literally
throw themselves at me.

31:47.853 --> 31:49.370
But not Claire.

31:49.455 --> 31:52.073
Do you really think I'd risk everything
I've built for one piece of ass?

31:52.158 --> 31:55.160
No, not you.
Never you.

31:55.211 --> 31:57.245
But this was about
something else.

31:58.864 --> 32:00.415
Isn't it, son?

32:01.917 --> 32:03.251
What do you mean?

32:03.335 --> 32:05.587
3 friends in a boat, right?

32:05.654 --> 32:07.806
One of them decides
to rock the thing.

32:07.873 --> 32:11.059
So to save their own lives,
what do the other two do?

32:12.595 --> 32:16.447
Throw him overboard.

32:16.515 --> 32:18.099
Right.

32:23.105 --> 32:26.474
You and Claire were
planning a takeover,

32:26.542 --> 32:28.226
weren't you?

32:33.282 --> 32:34.782
Yes.

32:36.252 --> 32:38.503
Very good.

32:38.570 --> 32:41.372
So, you struck first.

32:41.423 --> 32:43.708
Attack the attacker.

32:43.759 --> 32:45.009
You squeeze him out
of the company,

32:45.077 --> 32:48.246
but you couldn't just
give Claire the boot, could you?

32:48.297 --> 32:50.498
Claire was on my side.
She signed documents.

32:50.566 --> 32:52.416
Because you forced her to.
Yeah, you did everything you could

32:52.468 --> 32:54.886
to turn her into the girl
that you wanted her to be, right?

32:54.937 --> 32:57.922
Loyal to you.
In love with you.

32:57.973 --> 32:59.607
But she didn't love you.

32:59.692 --> 33:01.893
You're in love with yourself.

33:01.944 --> 33:03.427
That's your weakness.

33:03.479 --> 33:04.696
Eh? Then, of course,
you found out

33:04.763 --> 33:05.864
that she was
shagging this one.

33:05.931 --> 33:07.448
I did not touch her.

33:07.533 --> 33:10.869
Was Claire shocked when
you grabbed the knife, Zach,

33:10.936 --> 33:14.539
huh? Did she scream?
Did you stand there and watch her bleed?

33:14.606 --> 33:16.291
Did you?!

33:16.375 --> 33:17.959
Go on.

33:18.043 --> 33:19.711
Let it out.

33:19.778 --> 33:22.297
Kick the cat, little boy.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.251
You know you want to.

33:27.452 --> 33:30.454
All the evidence
points to Kyle.

33:30.506 --> 33:32.257
Whether he killed her
or not.

33:32.308 --> 33:33.892
I still have
unlimited funds

33:33.959 --> 33:35.626
and the best lawyers
on the planet.

33:35.678 --> 33:37.395
The truth
doesn't matter.

33:37.462 --> 33:39.681
Well, you're probably
right about that.

33:40.983 --> 33:44.652
But, it does matter
who your friends are.

33:44.737 --> 33:47.372
It's a handy little tool,
this,

33:47.439 --> 33:50.191
for letting all your friends
know what you've been up to.

33:51.643 --> 33:54.245
I still have
unlimited funds

33:54.313 --> 33:56.147
and the best lawyers
on the planet.

33:56.198 --> 33:57.648
The truth doesn't matter.

34:00.485 --> 34:04.122
Everything you said
just went viral.

34:04.173 --> 34:06.591
You just made yourself
the prime suspect.

34:06.658 --> 34:11.346
You might want to call
them lawyers now...Son.

34:33.302 --> 34:36.786
Anybody else was back here
without my permission, they'd be fired.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.558
I'm guessing you threaten
lot of people.

34:40.587 --> 34:41.536
You're fired.

34:41.605 --> 34:43.222
I'm not even hired yet.

34:44.391 --> 34:45.757
You read that book?

34:45.809 --> 34:49.228
Guess you don't want this,
then, huh?

34:49.279 --> 34:51.063
I paid for it.

34:51.114 --> 34:54.065
100 bucks?
No, that was expenses.

34:54.117 --> 34:56.001
It's all here, though.

34:56.069 --> 34:57.319
Photos, notes,

34:57.404 --> 35:00.840
where he went,
what he did--real specific.

35:00.907 --> 35:03.943
You know, this kid
you had me follow, he's a bad dude.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.744
Fights, drugs, sex.

35:05.796 --> 35:07.713
Lots of sex.
I mean like a farm animal.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.114
There's this one
cute little--

35:09.166 --> 35:10.466
be careful.

35:11.301 --> 35:13.519
Come on, open it.

35:14.287 --> 35:15.788
You're winding me up.

35:15.856 --> 35:18.557
100 bucks for a week's work.
Who's winding up who?

35:18.625 --> 35:20.259
There's nothing in it.

35:20.310 --> 35:24.647
Then open it. Find out.

35:29.519 --> 35:31.637
Here. Give it here.

35:49.456 --> 35:51.823
That's the photo
I gave you earlier.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.008
And nothing else.

35:53.093 --> 35:55.094
What you get for spying
on your daughter's man.

35:55.161 --> 35:57.263
And yet you checked up
on him anyway.

35:57.330 --> 35:59.381
Yeah.

36:07.641 --> 36:11.060
When he wasn't in school,
nose in his books.

36:11.144 --> 36:14.029
Football practice, that little
singing club they do...

36:14.114 --> 36:15.981
Glee club.
That's very funny.

36:16.032 --> 36:17.216
Yeah, he ain't like
you and me.

36:17.284 --> 36:19.568
I think he's what they call
an upstanding citizen.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.203
You speak
for yourself, son.

36:23.022 --> 36:25.457
Your daughter seems like
a smart girl.

36:25.525 --> 36:27.560
If you don't trust her
with the guy she's seeing

36:27.627 --> 36:29.061
or the guy she's gonna see...

36:29.129 --> 36:31.530
This is coming from
a parent, right?

36:31.581 --> 36:33.749
Yeah. I got a kid.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.200
How old?

36:35.252 --> 36:36.969
She'll be 3 this June.

36:37.036 --> 36:39.138
So that's a mouth
to feed, then.

36:40.707 --> 36:42.725
I get by.

36:44.644 --> 36:46.679
You could try showing
just a little respect.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.879
Well, how do you know
I'm not?

36:47.931 --> 36:48.931
What, showing respect?

36:48.999 --> 36:50.449
Trying.

36:53.653 --> 36:55.971
I'm out of cash.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.740
Will a check do?

37:00.877 --> 37:02.278
Respect?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.964
What you really need
is the truth, sir,

37:05.031 --> 37:07.733
and what I really need
is a job.

37:12.905 --> 37:16.208
Claire talked
about you a lot.

37:16.259 --> 37:19.411
I, um, I found this
at her place.

37:19.462 --> 37:21.263
She would have wanted
you to have it.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.451
When did you first meet her?

37:42.535 --> 37:44.787
When she was 12.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.291
She made those with you.

37:51.461 --> 37:55.047
Child psychology 101.

38:00.387 --> 38:03.005
For the first 4 sessions,

38:03.089 --> 38:06.058
Claire didn't talk at all.

38:08.144 --> 38:11.680
Then you brought those in.

38:12.632 --> 38:15.668
We just sat
and made necklaces.

38:23.176 --> 38:27.496
Well, you got her head
screwed on right.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.448
More or less.

38:31.785 --> 38:36.121
Yeah, the truth is, that's about
the best you can ever hope for.

38:43.847 --> 38:45.447
Come here.

38:48.435 --> 38:52.388
What's your excuse
with me, then, eh, Gillian?

39:29.943 --> 39:32.678
I got a maths problem
for you, Einstein.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.147
You got a billion dollars,

39:35.215 --> 39:39.618
your friend takes half,
your lawyers take 5% a month.

39:39.686 --> 39:41.487
How long till you run out
of friends?

39:41.554 --> 39:44.356
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.558
Don't, then.
It's a free country.

39:46.626 --> 39:48.844
Oh. Sorry.

40:00.457 --> 40:02.674
Ok. What?

40:02.742 --> 40:04.810
I've recommended
to the judge

40:04.878 --> 40:07.045
you be sentenced
to a mental hospital.

40:10.049 --> 40:12.050
Why would you do that
for me?

40:13.753 --> 40:16.255
You framed an innocent man.

40:16.322 --> 40:19.825
You hacked my computers.

40:19.893 --> 40:24.430
You hurt a very close
friend of mine.

40:24.497 --> 40:26.665
You murdered
a wonderful young girl.

40:26.733 --> 40:31.036
Now, prison will only
take your freedom.

40:31.104 --> 40:33.205
But at a hospital...

40:33.273 --> 40:35.541
The pills they'll give you,

40:35.608 --> 40:37.176
they'll take your mind.

40:37.243 --> 40:40.779
And make no mistake...

40:40.847 --> 40:45.284
Dr. Foster
will make sure of that

40:45.351 --> 40:47.118
personally.

41:09.442 --> 41:11.844
Hi there.

41:11.911 --> 41:14.112
Where's Liam?

41:14.180 --> 41:15.747
Hmm. Ironic.

41:15.815 --> 41:17.666
The one time
you get his name right

41:17.734 --> 41:20.502
and it's the same
day that...Hmm.

41:24.156 --> 41:25.457
Hey.

41:30.997 --> 41:32.798
You all right?

41:32.849 --> 41:34.099
Mm, yeah, I'm fine.

41:34.166 --> 41:35.868
Ok.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.639
Liam's a bloody idiot.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.641
I actually broke up
with him.

41:42.709 --> 41:43.859
Really?

41:43.943 --> 41:46.111
Why? What'd he do?

41:46.178 --> 41:48.814
Nothing.
That's kind of the point.

41:48.882 --> 41:51.250
All right.

41:51.317 --> 41:53.852
Go on, you can tell me.

41:53.903 --> 41:56.989
Go on.
You know you can.

41:58.575 --> 42:00.659
You know you're gonna
tell me in the end.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.411
So, that's you and me.

42:02.495 --> 42:04.563
It's, you know,
all the way, no secrets--

42:04.631 --> 42:08.500
Liam...Doesn't believe in
sex before marriage.

42:11.638 --> 42:13.705
Are you laughing?

42:14.924 --> 42:17.392
No. No, I'm--no, no.

42:17.477 --> 42:19.061
I mean, you never know.

42:19.145 --> 42:22.297
All that exercise was just
a substitute for something else.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.583
A total waste of a good
pair of hamstrings.

42:24.651 --> 42:26.618
You know, you can be
a real jackass sometimes.

42:26.686 --> 42:28.820
You just finding
that out now, are you?

42:29.739 --> 42:31.240
You're funny.

42:31.324 --> 42:32.991
I know.

42:33.726 --> 42:35.727
It's tragic.

42:36.562 --> 42:38.263
I have a question.

42:38.331 --> 42:40.232
Uh-oh.

42:41.784 --> 42:43.969
What's that look mean?

42:47.006 --> 42:50.442
Gillian.

42:50.510 --> 42:52.177
Do you love her?

42:52.245 --> 42:54.446
Of course I do, darling.
Of course I love her.

42:54.514 --> 42:58.917
No, I mean,
really love her?

43:04.190 --> 43:05.757
Yeah.

43:05.808 --> 43:10.462
Well, what are you
waiting for?

43:19.439 --> 43:22.187
I don't have an answer
for that one, love.
