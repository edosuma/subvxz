00:46.118 --> 00:48.056
Previously on the 4400...

00:48.080 --> 00:50.020
Kevin's a genius, you know,

00:50.048 --> 00:51.375
but he doesn't brag about it.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.627
Kevin, did you just speak to me?

00:56.662 --> 00:57.601
I haven't

00:58.188 --> 01:00.760
said anything for a long time.

01:00.783 --> 01:01.967
Try six years.

01:02.002 --> 01:05.348
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father of the 4400 technology.

01:05.372 --> 01:07.779
I can think again too.

01:07.896 --> 01:09.787
Kyle never came home last night.

01:09.807 --> 01:10.923
Kyle said he blacked out.

01:10.958 --> 01:14.316
You could've come to me, told me what was
going on. He's your cousin, your friend.

01:14.339 --> 01:17.639
Kyle thinks he did something during one of
his blackouts. He seemed really freaked out about it.

01:20.654 --> 01:22.990
If it happened during one of his blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

01:23.014 --> 01:26.062
I don't remember them telling me
to turn my son into a murderer.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.166
I kept hoping
i was wrong about it.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.796
This is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold onto that.

01:30.831 --> 01:31.606
Kyle...

01:31.630 --> 01:33.590
you weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

01:33.614 --> 01:35.898
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.892
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

01:38.939 --> 01:41.134
They just arrested
a suspect in the Collier killing.

01:41.170 --> 01:45.312
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for. It's all over.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.532
Not yet.

01:49.742 --> 01:52.225
Thursday, July 28
5:37 pm

01:57.075 --> 01:57.897
Mommy,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.280
i'm scared.

02:00.515 --> 02:01.748
I know, baby.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.531
I'm scared too.

02:04.930 --> 02:06.268
But it's going to be okay,

02:06.644 --> 02:08.158
because mommy's here.

02:08.739 --> 02:09.384
Okay?

02:17.991 --> 02:20.152
Whatever's coming through that door...

02:23.768 --> 02:24.930
I'll protect you.

02:50.934 --> 02:56.300
* so long ago, another life *

02:56.300 --> 03:00.234
* i can feel your heart beat *

03:00.234 --> 03:05.700
* it's not a dream
remember us *

03:05.700 --> 03:10.034
* i can see it in your eyes *

03:10.034 --> 03:13.234
* we'll find our place in time *

03:13.234 --> 03:18.867
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

03:18.867 --> 03:22.500
* we'll find our place in time *

03:22.500 --> 03:27.901
* our place in time
to call our own *

03:42.086 --> 03:44.269
Thursday, July 28
7:22 am
Ten Hours Earlier

04:01.574 --> 04:04.441
Today is Jordan Collier's Birthday

04:07.324 --> 04:08.991
He died on NTAC's watch

04:10.341 --> 04:11.748
What does that mean?

04:11.783 --> 04:13.121
What's what means?

04:13.157 --> 04:15.235
Nothing.
Just some crank...

04:15.869 --> 04:16.973
it's nothing.

04:17.219 --> 04:19.415
Guess it's Jordan Collier's birthday.

04:19.981 --> 04:22.676
The state of washington gave him
a birthday present. Did you read this?

04:22.717 --> 04:24.466
They're talking like
it's an open-and-shut case.

04:24.490 --> 04:27.942
He made threats against Collier.
Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.490
But they're wrong.
Roy marsden didn't kill Jordan Collier.

04:30.527 --> 04:31.783
And neither did you, Kyle.

04:31.819 --> 04:34.320
You told me he'd never see a courtroom.
They want to execute this guy.

04:34.355 --> 04:38.703
It's not going to happen, Kyle.
No one can put him up on that roof. Any...

04:38.726 --> 04:42.906
any public defender will have a motion to dismiss
in front of a judge by this time next week.

04:42.930 --> 04:45.806
What if you're wrong? What if they find him guilty?
What am i supposed to do? Nothing?

04:45.841 --> 04:50.241
Marsden has been in and out of jail since
he was 15. Theft, assault, attempted rape...

04:50.276 --> 04:51.427
but he didn't kill anybody.

04:51.450 --> 04:54.362
And he's not going to be convicted of it, Kyle.
I'm not going to let it happen.

04:54.397 --> 04:55.653
Neither will i.

05:00.380 --> 05:04.831
Kyle, it's not going to be easy, but you're going
to have to start putting all this behind you.

05:04.866 --> 05:06.850
It's your first day back at school,

05:06.885 --> 05:08.305
and i want you focused

05:08.376 --> 05:09.796
and fierce,

05:10.219 --> 05:11.910
and thinking about "a"s.

05:14.916 --> 05:15.667
Okay.

05:16.453 --> 05:17.240
Okay.

05:18.567 --> 05:19.436
All right.

05:27.572 --> 05:28.758
Sweetie...

05:28.934 --> 05:32.316
Mrs. Benke's going to be here
any minute. It's time to get up.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.343
I don't feel good.

05:37.574 --> 05:39.992
You've got a real fever, young lady.

05:45.605 --> 05:46.233
Hey,

05:47.255 --> 05:48.711
how long have you had that?

05:51.294 --> 05:54.769
Dishonest? No, no, no.
I don't think we're being dishonest at all.

05:55.316 --> 05:58.862
Human beings use less than
20% of their brain capacity.

05:58.898 --> 06:00.682
Everything else is just...

06:00.753 --> 06:03.557
collecting cobwebs.
Here at the 4400 center,

06:03.592 --> 06:05.438
we're trying to tap into
that unused potential.

06:05.471 --> 06:09.381
So your own ability, you believe it
stems from increased brainpower?

06:09.416 --> 06:11.189
Show me another explanation.

06:11.212 --> 06:14.909
Look, whether you believe that
we were taken to the future or not,

06:14.945 --> 06:18.361
somebody did change us,
and they used technology to do it.

06:18.397 --> 06:20.827
We're just trying to figure out
how and share it.

06:20.862 --> 06:25.223
But "first keys," "second keys,"
"unlocking the ability inside you..."

06:25.262 --> 06:29.002
you have to admit that the terminology
is more religious than scientific.

06:29.049 --> 06:31.785
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

06:32.002 --> 06:33.493
It's a potent combination.

06:44.826 --> 06:46.858
So what time was
your appointment for?

06:48.088 --> 06:50.084
They told me 11:15...

06:50.108 --> 06:52.761
but they always tell me 11:15.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.978
I never get in before 12:00, 12:30.

06:56.398 --> 06:59.259
Hey, free health care, right?
So what if they're so slow?

06:59.373 --> 07:01.318
Compulsory free health care.

07:01.424 --> 07:05.510
You don't show up for a quarterly checkup,
you've got the goon squad knocking at your door.

07:05.545 --> 07:06.720
You don't like it?

07:06.896 --> 07:07.976
Don't show.

07:08.305 --> 07:11.076
Doubt they'd slap the cuffs
on someone's grandma.

07:15.315 --> 07:16.571
Does it itch at all?

07:17.560 --> 07:18.358
Here.

07:19.321 --> 07:21.181
103.1.

07:21.211 --> 07:22.808
No wonder you wanted
to stay in bed.

07:23.248 --> 07:24.868
Is it some kind of flu?

07:25.185 --> 07:26.659
Most likely.

07:27.293 --> 07:29.218
Is it okay if we keep her
here for a few hours?

07:29.254 --> 07:30.604
I want to go home.

07:30.627 --> 07:34.361
I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you,

07:34.396 --> 07:36.780
and i'll look in on you as often as i can.

07:36.827 --> 07:38.759
I wish i brought Lemon.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.178
That's her stuffed dog.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.409
Let me guess.
He's yellow.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.592
Yeah. Well, i could go
back and get him.

07:46.898 --> 07:48.518
You have a very nice mommy.

07:49.481 --> 07:50.608
I try.

07:51.113 --> 07:52.663
About this rash...

07:52.980 --> 07:57.132
now, i worked at the C. D. C. For seven years,
and i never saw anything like it.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.682
It's kind of a weird shape, huh?

07:58.717 --> 07:59.327
Yeah.

07:59.351 --> 08:01.664
Don't read too much into it.
It could still be

08:01.711 --> 08:04.282
hives... an allergic reaction.
We'll take care of it.

08:06.492 --> 08:08.547
Sweetie, you'll be okay here

08:08.582 --> 08:09.745
if i go get lemon?

08:10.332 --> 08:11.612
Okay, my darling.

08:12.739 --> 08:13.796
Bye, darling.

08:14.559 --> 08:18.892
When daddy's away, he misses Isabelle so much.
But traveling around the country,

08:19.626 --> 08:23.043
talking to all sorts of people,
clueing them in about my life...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.027
it's kind of fun.

08:28.647 --> 08:30.232
Shawn's amazing.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.264
This woman comes in.

08:32.452 --> 08:35.422
Her c. A. T. Scan says she's got
a brain tumor the size of a walnut.

08:35.446 --> 08:38.102
20 minutes later, she's on
her way. Good as new.

08:38.171 --> 08:38.866
Hmm.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.669
I'll feed her.

08:40.705 --> 08:42.231
She's not hungry yet.

08:42.807 --> 08:43.854
How do you know?

08:43.900 --> 08:45.745
She told me before you came in.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.271
So she's...

08:47.811 --> 08:49.091
...talking to me.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.285
Communicating.
Same as she does with you.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.937
- Since when?
- This morning.

08:59.927 --> 09:02.698
I thought you'd be happy.
First time she ever said anything to me.

09:02.745 --> 09:04.612
That's great.
It's just...

09:06.209 --> 09:08.228
she hasn't said anything
to me for weeks.

09:08.263 --> 09:11.046
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just how you used to tell me...

09:11.081 --> 09:14.550
kids always alternate
between parents. It's normal...

09:16.476 --> 09:18.918
just with Isabelle,
it comes with a twist.

09:25.476 --> 09:29.996
This is major Charles Culp of the National
Security Agency's field enforcement divisiÃ³n.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.852
D. C. Has loaned us his services.

09:31.912 --> 09:34.794
Effective immediately, the major
and his team will be providing backup

09:34.852 --> 09:38.393
in any 4400 cases
requiring armed intervention.

09:40.490 --> 09:42.862
We know this office bears
a heavy caseload,

09:43.085 --> 09:44.752
and we're here to help when needed.

09:44.776 --> 09:46.044
Welcome aboard.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.202
Hope you guys are up to it, 'cause
i'm going to have you on speed dial.

09:49.238 --> 09:52.021
We'll stay out of your way,
let you do your jobs.

09:52.044 --> 09:53.453
When the time comes,

09:53.606 --> 09:55.285
we hope you'll return the favor.

09:55.320 --> 09:59.906
Well, the last lady that we went up against
released poison spores from her palms, so, uh...

09:59.941 --> 10:02.031
if you want to track her
down instead of me...

10:02.055 --> 10:03.311
by all means.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.976
My men and i are used to
unique challenges.

10:06.798 --> 10:08.912
How long have we been asking
for tactical support?

10:08.933 --> 10:09.896
Eight months.

10:09.931 --> 10:11.787
I guess someone up
there likes us.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.806
You guys check your emails
this morning?

10:13.830 --> 10:16.401
"Happy birthday, Jordan Collier"?

10:16.648 --> 10:18.820
Everyone in the building
got that one.

10:18.984 --> 10:21.921
Maybe Marco should have one
of his guys try to backtrack it.

10:22.074 --> 10:26.876
They already did. It came from
a public terminal in an internet cafe.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.696
It was a new email account.

10:29.245 --> 10:31.816
Nice to know
Collier's still got his fans.

10:34.212 --> 10:35.139
What's that?

10:35.926 --> 10:38.166
It's valerian root or

10:38.201 --> 10:41.395
something. I don't know. Alana swears by it.
They calm me down a little.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.590
My suggestion?
Double your dosage.

10:43.614 --> 10:45.831
The Baldwin trigger has been
a little "hair" lately.

10:45.866 --> 10:47.451
My girlfriend agrees with you.

10:47.486 --> 10:49.670
I need you to cover me
for an hour.

10:50.081 --> 10:53.721
Maia's got the flu or something, and
Hudson wants her to spend the day here.

10:53.756 --> 10:54.620
She okay?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.770
I'm sure it's nothing.

10:55.794 --> 11:00.561
I mean, i was sure that it was the bubonic plague,
but her doctor tells me that it's nothing.

11:01.524 --> 11:04.212
So you plowed into some guy
and got away with it?

11:04.629 --> 11:06.496
That's kind of a weird way to put it.

11:07.142 --> 11:10.007
Well, the perks of having
a dad at N. T. A. C., i guess.

11:10.441 --> 11:12.520
And this guy you hit,
how messed up was he?

11:12.543 --> 11:15.044
I can't really talk about it.
You know, it's lawyer stuff.

11:15.351 --> 11:16.678
Who am i going to tell?

11:19.285 --> 11:21.539
I broke both his legs
and his collarbone.

11:22.197 --> 11:23.089
That's it?

11:24.263 --> 11:26.497
He was in a car, Danny.
It's not like i mowed over a pedestrian.

11:26.532 --> 11:30.501
Yeah, but you kept talking about this "awful thing"
you did. I thought you killed somebody.

11:31.076 --> 11:31.827
What?

11:32.461 --> 11:33.953
Well, thanks a lot, man.

11:33.982 --> 11:35.191
So did Shawn.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.340
Well, sorry to disappoint you guys.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.262
Well, look, do me a favor, okay?

11:40.321 --> 11:42.998
If you get in trouble again,
tell somebody.

11:43.491 --> 11:46.579
There's nothing you can tell me
or Shawn that we can't handle.

11:46.731 --> 11:49.646
Next time i black out and have a car accident,
you'll be the first to know.

11:50.115 --> 11:52.358
Yeah, long as i'm not riding shotgun.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.571
Oh, hey, listen, you want to go see
arcade fire with me on friday night, or

11:57.616 --> 12:00.023
do you have to stay home
and nurse your guilty conscience?

12:00.199 --> 12:01.256
No nursing. I'll go.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.031
- Yeah?
- I'll go.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.041
- All right.
- Yeah.

12:03.769 --> 12:04.872
It's good to have you back.

12:05.283 --> 12:06.424
Good to be back.

12:07.633 --> 12:08.537
I got to go.

12:09.418 --> 12:10.615
Okay. See you.

12:38.287 --> 12:39.238
You hear that?

12:40.506 --> 12:41.469
That buzz?

12:45.226 --> 12:46.107
What is it?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.044
What?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.637
Is that coming from your gadget?

12:51.071 --> 12:52.962
Is what coming from my gadget?

12:52.997 --> 12:54.241
That noise.

12:55.451 --> 12:56.672
I don't hear anything.

12:58.128 --> 12:59.257
Neither do i.

13:26.941 --> 13:28.021
What is that noise?

13:28.813 --> 13:29.952
You hear that?

13:32.100 --> 13:33.181
What's going on?

13:34.190 --> 13:35.576
I've got, like, a headache.

13:41.778 --> 13:43.478
Did you hear that?

13:43.994 --> 13:45.477
A gift from me to you

13:48.616 --> 13:49.698
Have fun trying to survive the day

13:50.244 --> 13:53.010
Why is my signature
on this requisition?

13:53.044 --> 13:55.027
Because i had to get it in!

13:55.060 --> 13:57.679
Do not sign my name
on another report.

13:57.721 --> 13:59.355
They sit on your desk for weeks.

13:59.407 --> 14:02.272
If there's a space for my signature,
it should be my signature!

14:03.981 --> 14:06.341
Foster and mcclenahan are tearing
each other apart by the elevator.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.278
Right before this started,
there was a noise.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.347
I didn't hear anything.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.721
Yeah, well, the rest of us did!

14:12.388 --> 14:14.734
There was some kind
of high-pitched whine,

14:14.769 --> 14:18.714
and we got another one of those emails.
It said, "have fun trying to survive the day."

14:19.264 --> 14:20.367
Show me.

14:20.403 --> 14:22.440
Okay, everybody try to stay calm.

14:22.493 --> 14:26.049
If this noise or signal did something
to you... you've got to fight it.

14:27.082 --> 14:28.455
What she's talking about?

14:30.311 --> 14:32.389
What did i just tell you?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.342
- Nina.
- You saw it.

14:45.988 --> 14:48.817
She pulled her weapon first.
I was defending myself...

14:50.614 --> 14:51.687
how is she?

14:51.774 --> 14:53.770
Breathing.
She's bleeding pretty bad.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.107
Get her to medical.
Park is under arrest.

14:56.130 --> 14:57.584
Crowley, restrain him.

15:01.623 --> 15:03.114
Baldwin, what are you doing?

15:03.147 --> 15:06.528
Until we know what's going on,
nobody gets in and nobody goes out.

15:08.677 --> 15:09.722
What's going on?

15:19.282 --> 15:21.196
Security procedure enabled.

15:22.628 --> 15:26.111
Who's a very good girl?
Isabelle is.

15:26.146 --> 15:28.506
Isabelle's a smartie.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.717
Glad to see you guys are having fun.

15:30.752 --> 15:32.936
Lily. I didn't expect to
see you till 5:00.

15:32.971 --> 15:35.625
Well, i'm taking an early lunch. I thought
i'd take Isabelle out to the garden.

15:35.672 --> 15:38.666
That sounds fun.
Doesn't it, little girl?

15:39.263 --> 15:42.245
Oh, i use flash cards with her
all the time.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.640
Let's see if i can find an apple.
It's her favorite.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.012
What is this?

15:59.311 --> 16:04.050
Someone's been mixing up our cards.
I've told them a million times.

16:04.085 --> 16:05.670
What do you use these for?

16:05.705 --> 16:07.502
These don't belong in the nursery.

16:07.537 --> 16:12.163
I think they use them for the applicants.
Part of their psych profile. Sorry.

16:12.515 --> 16:14.185
Okay, Isabelle.

16:14.784 --> 16:17.168
Going to go with mommy.

16:17.907 --> 16:18.929
Okay.

16:19.739 --> 16:20.901
See you real soon.

16:35.727 --> 16:38.839
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

16:38.886 --> 16:40.260
It's a potent combination.

16:40.307 --> 16:43.371
The movement's 100,000 members
would certainly agree,

16:43.394 --> 16:47.525
but Kevin Burkhoff, a neuroscientist
at western washington university,

16:47.560 --> 16:48.887
thinks otherwise.

16:49.233 --> 16:53.084
Uh, i don't question anybody's faith.
Why should i? Faith is a good thing, right?

16:53.119 --> 16:56.765
But what they're doing over there at the center
has nothing to do with science. I mean,

16:56.800 --> 17:01.191
you tell me how fasting,
meditation, and chanting

17:01.238 --> 17:05.494
can alter, in any way, your
neurochemistry. It's preposterous.

17:05.595 --> 17:07.973
It's a good scam,
but still preposterous.

17:07.996 --> 17:09.452
"Scam." That's a strong word.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.458
It fits. They're taking
this kernel of truth

17:12.492 --> 17:16.577
about the brain's potential, and using it
to bilk people out of their life savings.

17:16.613 --> 17:19.525
A lot of people might be surprised
by your stance. After all,

17:19.571 --> 17:22.795
you suffered from paranoid
personality disorder for years.

17:22.829 --> 17:26.928
Wasn't it a device engineered
by a 4400 that cured you?

17:27.098 --> 17:28.777
Yes, and i'm grateful,

17:28.965 --> 17:33.244
but you need to make the distinction
between the 4400 and the 4400 center.

17:33.267 --> 17:36.449
4400s have remarkable abilities...
everybody knows it...

17:36.496 --> 17:40.195
but the center is co-opting
that phenomenon for profit.

17:40.218 --> 17:42.945
Those machines they're hooking
people up to over there?

17:42.969 --> 17:45.153
They might as well not
even be plugged in.

17:45.575 --> 17:48.217
If you ask me, he still
looks rather demented.

17:49.321 --> 17:52.900
He seemed pretty sane to me, Matthew,
especially when he was ripping us...

17:52.947 --> 17:54.649
Shawn, don't overreact.

17:54.696 --> 17:55.929
It's just one interview.

17:55.964 --> 17:56.692
Oh...

17:57.490 --> 17:58.967
You did good, though.

18:00.118 --> 18:00.998
Yeah.

18:02.595 --> 18:04.122
Garrity, give me the gun.

18:05.143 --> 18:06.858
Look, this is crazy, Baldwin.

18:06.893 --> 18:08.147
How are we going to
defend ourselves?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.472
Whoever's doing this wants us
to attack each other.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.832
If we stay armed, we're dead
by the end of the day.

18:12.879 --> 18:14.347
If we don't, we'll be slaughtered.

18:14.382 --> 18:17.123
Look, everyone in the building
is under the effects of this thing, okay?

18:17.158 --> 18:19.835
The cafeteria staff could be
forming an army right now.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.700
Which is why i'll find out
who's doing this and stop it.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.882
They're doing checkups in the medical lab today.
That means there's 4400s in the building.

18:25.906 --> 18:27.333
You think that one of them
is behind this?

18:27.368 --> 18:28.202
I...

18:28.977 --> 18:30.210
I don't know,

18:30.480 --> 18:32.499
but right now,
it's all i have to go on.

18:32.887 --> 18:33.885
You?

18:34.167 --> 18:35.587
Who put you in command?

18:35.628 --> 18:37.213
He's not. I am.

18:37.824 --> 18:40.227
This building is the target
of a 4400 terrorist attack.

18:40.251 --> 18:41.824
It is now a military situation.

18:41.853 --> 18:43.138
This is great, Baldwin.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.298
Why don't you explain to these guys
why they should just lay down their arms, huh?

18:46.321 --> 18:50.299
Major Culp, the signal, whatever it is,
it's like someone set off a rage bomb.

18:50.358 --> 18:53.634
It's pumping up the aggressiÃ³n of everybody
in the building. The men, anyway.

18:53.687 --> 18:55.988
We cannot be walking around
with loaded firearms.

18:56.012 --> 18:58.689
My team's trained to resist
psychological pressure tactics.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.331
This is a 4400 ability.
You can't resist it.

19:01.355 --> 19:04.455
There's 4400s down in the med lab.
It's probably one of them doing it.

19:04.502 --> 19:06.509
Baldwin was just headed
down there right now.

19:06.662 --> 19:08.165
Cartwright, watch them.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.606
Everyone else, with me.

19:09.629 --> 19:10.663
Just wait. Wait.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.717
What are you going to do?

19:12.753 --> 19:14.667
I'm going to find out which one of
them's responsible for this.

19:14.702 --> 19:15.782
And then what?

19:16.299 --> 19:18.142
I'm going to make sure that it stops.

19:18.645 --> 19:20.606
Be careful.
There's a little girl down there.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.202
If it's not her,

19:23.424 --> 19:25.150
then she has nothing
to worry about.

19:31.260 --> 19:33.057
You have to let me out!

19:33.902 --> 19:35.370
We got to get out!

19:35.969 --> 19:37.425
We're going to get killed!

19:37.460 --> 19:39.642
Would you stop saying
that already?

19:40.604 --> 19:42.107
It's not helping.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.253
An "a"?
That's great.

19:49.899 --> 19:51.977
But what's my name
doing on here?

19:53.386 --> 19:55.206
Well, we're lab partners, right?

19:55.452 --> 19:57.096
This is our presentation.

19:57.308 --> 20:00.530
But i haven't met with you in almost three
weeks. I didn't type a word of this.

20:00.553 --> 20:04.228
Well, it's not like you didn't do anything.
You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis.

20:04.264 --> 20:05.943
You stained the slides.

20:05.966 --> 20:07.939
One or two of them, maybe.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.569
Look... you were in trouble, right?

20:10.675 --> 20:13.282
I just figured
that whatever it was,

20:13.352 --> 20:16.238
you could probably do without
an "incomplete" in bio.

20:19.714 --> 20:22.778
I still don't know if i deserve this,
but thank you.

20:22.819 --> 20:24.029
What can i say?

20:24.299 --> 20:26.401
I have a soft spot for stray cats.

20:27.531 --> 20:29.163
I look that pathetic?

20:32.838 --> 20:33.719
Hardly.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.920
You're shooting up?

20:44.179 --> 20:46.210
Doesn't exactly fill me
with confidence.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.318
It's a sedative.
If i lose control

20:48.341 --> 20:50.384
and become like everyone
else in this place,

20:50.631 --> 20:52.228
i can't help you anymore.

20:52.263 --> 20:53.813
What's happening to my agents?

20:54.212 --> 20:56.537
I don't feel any different,
but they're all going crazy.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.342
Dr. Hudson?

21:01.092 --> 21:02.865
I feel worse.

21:03.452 --> 21:05.131
You shouldn't be out of bed.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.910
Sweetie, what's that on your arm?

21:21.447 --> 21:24.018
Skouris, N. T. A. C. I need to get past.

21:24.053 --> 21:25.392
Building's locked down.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.207
Well, what's going on?

21:27.242 --> 21:28.980
Security breach from the inside.

21:29.015 --> 21:30.095
That's all we know.

21:30.119 --> 21:32.009
- I have to get through.
- That's not going to happen.

21:32.044 --> 21:33.360
You don't understand.

21:33.829 --> 21:35.532
My daughter's in there.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.952
Thursday, July 28
3:19 pm

21:58.012 --> 21:59.762
Well, I can't do it myself.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.518
Turn around.

22:10.942 --> 22:12.102
Hold still.

22:25.585 --> 22:28.086
I can't believe you
broke my nose.

22:28.109 --> 22:30.375
Yeah, well, you broke
my knuckle when i hit you.

22:30.411 --> 22:32.919
But i'm still right.
The signal is constant.

22:32.954 --> 22:36.230
It doesn't matter if you can hear it
or not. It's like a dog whistle.

22:36.277 --> 22:40.398
It's one pulse, and it'll wear off.
We just have to wait it out...

22:40.867 --> 22:42.828
Both of you guys shut up!

22:43.168 --> 22:44.507
I'm trying to get work done.

22:49.297 --> 22:50.882
Not a good time, Diana.

22:50.918 --> 22:52.380
Marco, what's going on in there?

22:52.403 --> 22:53.953
Depends on who you ask.

22:53.988 --> 22:56.043
Somebody's definitely
set off a whammy in here.

22:56.090 --> 22:58.204
Something's pumping up
our "fight or flight" instincts.

22:58.239 --> 23:00.317
Heavy emphasis
on the "fight" part.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.710
Well, Marco, i need to get inside,
and i need your help.

23:02.745 --> 23:06.561
Every male in this building has got a gallon of
adrenaline coursing through his veins right now.

23:06.584 --> 23:09.896
And most of them are armed.
If you're on the outside, stay there.

23:09.943 --> 23:13.352
Listen to me, Marco. Maia is inside,
and i need to get to her.

23:13.399 --> 23:15.607
Do you have access
to the building schematics?

23:15.642 --> 23:17.638
Uh, yeah.
I can pull them up.

23:17.673 --> 23:18.847
Do it.

23:19.376 --> 23:21.267
And what do i get in return?

23:24.073 --> 23:26.598
Well, we can talk about that later.

23:26.879 --> 23:28.735
Good. Good.
I'm going to hold you to that.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.147
Get off me.
You're in my space!

23:30.171 --> 23:30.714
Hang on.

23:30.772 --> 23:32.366
- You're in my space!
- Guys!

23:32.519 --> 23:34.116
Settle it later!

23:34.527 --> 23:36.124
We've got to get
Skouris into the building.

23:36.159 --> 23:37.357
I said get on your knees.

23:37.392 --> 23:39.808
I just need to take these.
They're keeping me calm.

23:39.844 --> 23:41.170
Little late for that.

23:42.392 --> 23:44.787
You sure you don't want one?
They might help.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.037
Cut us loose. Come on.
Cut me free.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.118
Get some cuffs.

23:55.611 --> 23:58.145
Put them on commando-boy.
Then you can let everybody else go.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.589
Hey, hey, where are you going?

23:59.625 --> 24:03.229
I'm going to the med labs. Hopefully
the major met some resistance along the way.

24:06.094 --> 24:08.126
What kind of tests?
You mean like an i. Q. Thing?

24:08.149 --> 24:10.834
I don't know, Richard.
Those flash cards were weird,

24:10.869 --> 24:13.840
and after we got back,
i was changing her.

24:14.192 --> 24:16.129
She has these marks on her skin.

24:16.294 --> 24:17.656
Marks? Bruises?

24:17.692 --> 24:19.559
No. Like irritations.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.189
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

24:22.236 --> 24:23.046
Let me see.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.127
They faded.

24:24.185 --> 24:25.019
Richard...

24:25.254 --> 24:27.770
don't look at me like that.
I'm not imagining things.

24:27.817 --> 24:29.755
She's not going back
to that nursery.

24:29.778 --> 24:32.667
Lily... all you've been talking about
is how much you love ruth

24:32.702 --> 24:35.708
and the nursery, and how much
Isabelle seems to love it there.

24:35.731 --> 24:37.011
I wish you'd been there.

24:37.035 --> 24:40.051
I mean, ruth, she had
this weird smile on her face.

24:40.086 --> 24:43.421
Think about what you're saying.
Nobody's doing tests on her at the nursery.

24:44.020 --> 24:47.014
You know, i know you feel
like she's shutting you out, and

24:47.260 --> 24:49.853
no offense, but maybe
this is an overreaction.

24:50.933 --> 24:52.377
- Can i take her for a second?
- No.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.303
Lily, what are you doing?

24:55.007 --> 24:57.484
I'm sorry.
It's just this place.

24:58.435 --> 25:02.275
I feel like it's changing everything,
like it's changing us.

25:05.586 --> 25:07.647
We're okay.
Everything's okay.

25:12.297 --> 25:17.099
The meditation courses, the synaptic potential
readers, and our purification seminars...

25:17.158 --> 25:18.775
that's half our curriculum
you're putting on the chopping block.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.571
We don't need them, Matthew.

25:20.630 --> 25:22.156
Jordan seemed to think we did.

25:22.192 --> 25:24.117
Jordan's not here anymore, is he?

25:25.432 --> 25:27.555
Besides, that Burkhoff guy is right...

25:27.625 --> 25:30.983
a bunch of chanting is not going to
unlock the 4400 inside of anyone.

25:31.019 --> 25:33.590
Whether it will or it won't,
the product is selling.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.081
Wait, wait, wait. "product"?

25:35.551 --> 25:37.695
This is not a pyramid scheme, Matthew.

25:37.907 --> 25:41.523
People are coming here, they're looking to be
changed. They're looking for answers.

25:41.558 --> 25:43.097
And we'll find them,

25:43.308 --> 25:45.480
but if we change, we look weak.

25:46.079 --> 25:48.956
For now, all that matters is that
people believe in what we're doing.

25:49.003 --> 25:50.753
I need to believe in it, too.

26:09.873 --> 26:10.941
Nobody move!

26:12.327 --> 26:14.100
They're gone.
They all took off.

26:14.135 --> 26:14.992
Who are you?

26:15.027 --> 26:16.566
Roger wolcott.

26:17.153 --> 26:18.597
I'm just here for my checkup.

26:18.957 --> 26:19.790
The 4400?

26:19.826 --> 26:21.411
Why else would i be here?

26:21.446 --> 26:23.160
Now cut me loose!

26:31.358 --> 26:32.991
Thursday, July 28
4:22 pm

26:56.108 --> 26:59.231
That's not going to hold anybody.
Not for long. Let's hope no one finds us.

26:59.254 --> 27:00.898
What do you think
our chances are?

27:04.182 --> 27:07.106
The calmer we are,
the longer we stay alive.

27:10.488 --> 27:11.744
How are you doing, sweetie?

27:12.834 --> 27:15.217
I feel all sweaty,

27:16.345 --> 27:18.881
and it's getting hard to breathe.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.255
Poor baby.

27:20.842 --> 27:22.345
I have something for you.

27:25.857 --> 27:27.465
- Lemon.
- Yeah.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.716
As soon as this is over, i'm going
to get you to the hospital, okay?

27:32.373 --> 27:33.125
All right.

27:33.510 --> 27:36.163
I'm guessing you don't have
a stuffed animal for me.

27:36.879 --> 27:38.418
Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels?

27:38.456 --> 27:39.267
Sorry.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.862
Looks like it's starting to clot.

27:42.907 --> 27:44.233
You need another shot for pain?

27:45.032 --> 27:45.654
No.

27:46.497 --> 27:48.293
You need the sedatives
more than i do.

27:48.328 --> 27:49.890
How many shots have you taken?

27:50.324 --> 27:51.017
Three.

27:51.052 --> 27:54.422
And you're still on your feet? Shouldn't that
have knocked you on your ass by now?

27:54.458 --> 27:57.379
Well, on a normal day, i'd be out
for the next 12 hours, but today,

27:57.919 --> 27:59.505
it's barely enough
to keep me sane.

28:00.233 --> 28:01.266
Well, thank you...

28:01.912 --> 28:03.332
for keeping Maia safe.

28:03.732 --> 28:05.447
She's a sweet kid.

28:06.457 --> 28:07.796
Listen, Diana...

28:11.271 --> 28:13.162
Iook, i've only got
three shots left.

28:13.197 --> 28:15.547
They're wearing off a little
faster each time, so...

28:16.052 --> 28:19.387
i don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody. So if i...

28:19.810 --> 28:20.866
start to go...

28:20.890 --> 28:22.743
oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

28:22.778 --> 28:24.011
Do me a favor...

28:24.410 --> 28:26.160
back of the head, okay?

28:26.348 --> 28:27.944
You'll never see it coming.

28:29.952 --> 28:31.433
Now, listen, Hudson...

28:31.597 --> 28:34.098
Iook, i just gave you permissiÃ³n
to blow my head off.

28:34.134 --> 28:35.907
Why don't you call me Max?

28:36.787 --> 28:37.891
All right, Max.

28:39.582 --> 28:41.264
About this signal...

28:44.915 --> 28:47.440
which one of these bitches
do you think is sending it?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.178
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.362
Hey, you wanted to
know my story.

29:01.714 --> 29:03.348
Well, right now, you're living it.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.227
Open your eyes.

29:07.387 --> 29:10.382
Now, imagine three years went
by while you had them shut.

29:12.554 --> 29:13.672
Can't do it.

29:14.576 --> 29:15.798
Neither could i...

29:16.044 --> 29:17.218
but they were gone.

29:17.829 --> 29:21.457
I missed senior year of high school,
which is supposedly the best year ever.

29:21.970 --> 29:25.117
I got robbed. The rest
of high school just sucked.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.473
So this blackout that
you had behind the wheel,

29:29.802 --> 29:33.506
that was some sort of
after-effect of the coma?

29:34.610 --> 29:35.361
Yeah.

29:35.514 --> 29:36.383
Wow.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.095
God, you've been through so much.

29:39.130 --> 29:40.363
You're jealous?

29:42.172 --> 29:43.639
What part sounds good?

29:44.209 --> 29:45.184
The coma?

29:45.959 --> 29:47.321
The hit and run?

29:47.450 --> 29:48.683
I'm jealous

29:48.976 --> 29:52.578
because you have all
this experience under your belt.

29:54.257 --> 29:55.396
It makes you interesting.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.998
But i didn't do it.

30:03.501 --> 30:04.981
It wasn't me.

30:07.153 --> 30:10.065
Great, so now someone
can kill me in my sleep.

30:10.169 --> 30:11.684
How do you know it's one of us?

30:11.731 --> 30:12.788
Well, i don't,

30:12.823 --> 30:15.606
but none of you are talking,
and so i'm about out of options.

30:15.641 --> 30:17.837
This isn't going to make
a damn bit of difference.

30:20.807 --> 30:21.852
That's it.

30:22.556 --> 30:23.742
No more sedatives.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.527
Can you still function as a doctor?

30:25.703 --> 30:26.795
For now.

30:32.067 --> 30:33.507
Kind of busy here, Diana.

30:33.530 --> 30:36.618
We just put the 4400s under, but we're
not sure if that's killed the signal.

30:36.654 --> 30:38.191
Do you still feel amped up?

30:38.215 --> 30:40.751
Yes, i do, okay?
I'm working on it from my end.

30:46.082 --> 30:46.996
What's that noise?

30:47.042 --> 30:48.797
I'm trying to counter
the effects of the signal.

30:48.827 --> 30:51.915
If you'd just shut up for a second,
maybe i could find the right frequency...

30:51.933 --> 30:54.590
Okay, calm down, Marco.
I need you to do this.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.903
It always has to be me,
doesn't it?

30:56.938 --> 30:59.596
Old, reliable Marco
does whatever you want.

32:09.299 --> 32:11.800
I truly believe in what
we're trying to do.

32:11.847 --> 32:15.340
The 4400 are the template
for the next stage in human evolution.

32:15.363 --> 32:17.817
Do you mind backing up?
You're standing a little close.

32:30.354 --> 32:33.466
We can recreate the technology
they used to change us.

32:34.546 --> 32:36.883
Not by chanting "om"
three times, you can't.

32:36.918 --> 32:37.751
Agreed...

32:39.865 --> 32:43.293
but if you come to work with us,
we could get somewhere.

32:43.317 --> 32:44.186
You know,

32:44.843 --> 32:46.029
the government

32:46.393 --> 32:48.798
has approached me
half a dozen times.

32:48.833 --> 32:51.357
They seem to have
this bizarre theory i'm

32:51.393 --> 32:55.371
the father of this new branch
of science. I turned them down.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.199
I don't like working
with people with badges.

32:59.222 --> 33:02.261
Listen, you can't blame
them for being curious.

33:02.296 --> 33:05.666
You were in a mental hospital
for... six years?

33:05.736 --> 33:08.566
The future busted its ass
to get you working again.

33:08.599 --> 33:10.431
I haven't forgotten my debts.

33:12.979 --> 33:14.482
Oh? What's that?

33:14.881 --> 33:17.394
Signing bonus?
Fancy car?

33:18.649 --> 33:19.330
Me.

33:21.420 --> 33:23.299
I'm the pÃ³ster boy, right?

33:23.898 --> 33:25.119
Healing hands.

33:26.575 --> 33:28.090
Unlimited access.

33:33.032 --> 33:34.840
Can you really turn that down?

33:42.099 --> 33:42.898
Mommy,

33:43.931 --> 33:45.000
i'm scared.

33:45.563 --> 33:46.702
I know, baby.

33:48.146 --> 33:49.251
I'm scared too.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.212
But it's going to be okay,

33:51.705 --> 33:53.184
because mommy's here.

33:54.429 --> 33:55.098
Okay?

33:58.983 --> 34:00.791
Whatever's coming
through that door...

34:04.725 --> 34:05.922
i'll protect you.

34:18.645 --> 34:19.456
Tom.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.674
Tom... put the gun down.
It's me. It's Diana.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.445
No, you'll... you'll shoot me
if i put it down.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.534
No, Tom.
I don't want to hurt you.

34:38.967 --> 34:41.349
Well, i want to hurt you, Diana.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.016
Tom... i said calm down.

34:58.053 --> 35:00.847
My mom always wanted me
to hit it off with a cute doctor,

35:00.882 --> 35:03.571
but make another move,
and i will pull this trigger.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.029
What is that?

35:25.313 --> 35:28.073
That'd be Marco
earning his paycheck.

35:50.052 --> 35:52.071
I feel like an idiot.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.805
It's just... Isabelle and i
were so close for so long.

35:55.852 --> 35:57.425
And you still are.

35:58.071 --> 36:00.152
I know.
It's like you say...

36:00.575 --> 36:02.982
she's a baby.
It isn't personal.

36:03.017 --> 36:04.861
Yeah, you just have
to remember that.

36:06.223 --> 36:07.961
Hey, ruth, look who's back.

36:08.008 --> 36:09.347
That was a long lunch.

36:09.382 --> 36:11.484
Yeah, sorry.
Time got away from us.

36:11.871 --> 36:13.104
Come on. Here you are.

36:14.454 --> 36:16.087
We'll be back in an hour for her.

36:16.110 --> 36:17.366
- We'll be here.
- Thank you.

36:17.669 --> 36:19.055
Bye, Isabelle.

36:23.939 --> 36:25.877
I'd still like to do
a little house-hunting.

36:26.323 --> 36:28.706
We could take a look around,
see what's out there.

36:39.706 --> 36:43.933
You're in charge until i'm released.
Pool whatever manpower is still up walking.

36:44.156 --> 36:45.389
Start picking up the pieces.

36:45.421 --> 36:46.877
- I'll handle it.
- Mm-hmm.

36:46.924 --> 36:48.991
All right. And you get
that head looked at.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.202
How are you doing?

36:54.777 --> 36:57.501
Well, for a slender lady,
you pack a punch.

36:57.536 --> 37:01.185
I can't take all the credit.
Culp softened you up a little bit.

37:01.221 --> 37:02.029
Hmm.

37:02.430 --> 37:03.827
It's the final tally.

37:04.917 --> 37:08.592
Three agents dead, two N. S. A.
Operatives, a 4400...

37:09.637 --> 37:12.864
concussions, broken bones,
stab wounds... yikes.

37:12.888 --> 37:16.516
It's tough to swallow. It was
a major attack, and we weren't ready.

37:17.256 --> 37:18.007
Yeah.

37:22.772 --> 37:23.852
How are you, baby?

37:23.899 --> 37:24.827
Okay.

37:25.672 --> 37:27.245
Not so good.

37:27.281 --> 37:29.052
I've got her on glucose
and erythromycin.

37:29.099 --> 37:32.116
We're going to get her over to St. Michael's
and see if we can bring that fever down.

37:32.926 --> 37:34.089
And the rash?

37:34.605 --> 37:36.390
I'm going to bring in a specialist.

37:36.437 --> 37:37.564
Should i be worried?

37:37.595 --> 37:41.622
Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists
in the city. I'm sure he'll figure it out.

37:41.657 --> 37:43.606
You're coming with us,

37:43.642 --> 37:44.638
right?

37:46.058 --> 37:49.229
Of course. I'll be right there
in the ambulance with you.

37:51.272 --> 37:53.397
All right, i'll get to the hospital
as soon as i can.

37:53.436 --> 37:54.270
Okay.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.242
- Oh, Max...
- yeah.

37:56.806 --> 37:58.473
Thank you... for everything.

37:58.732 --> 38:00.469
No, thank you, for...

38:01.033 --> 38:02.829
well, for not putting one
in the back of my head.

38:06.402 --> 38:09.208
Uh, so those 4400s
Diana was protecting...

38:09.243 --> 38:12.672
they're not going to see daylight until N. T. A. C.'s
sure they're not responsible for this.

38:12.695 --> 38:14.891
That's going to be
a marathon debriefing sessiÃ³n.

38:14.938 --> 38:17.050
Yeah, i bet you they'll
both be up all night.

38:18.001 --> 38:18.752
Both?

38:19.997 --> 38:21.676
I thought Diana said
there was three of them.

38:28.684 --> 38:29.400
Tom?

38:29.447 --> 38:30.481
She's gone.

38:32.287 --> 38:34.957
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

38:34.985 --> 38:37.153
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.156
Do they even have
a name for that?

38:41.800 --> 38:42.845
Yeah, "terrorism."

38:46.905 --> 38:48.589
Payback is a bitch.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.517
Welcome to the center.
Would you like to sign up for the tour?

39:11.303 --> 39:12.055
No.

39:13.605 --> 39:16.939
Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin
Burkhoff is here to see him.

39:16.965 --> 39:19.806
I'm sorry. Mr. Farrell's
busy at the moment.

39:19.853 --> 39:21.955
Is there a message
i can pass along?

39:21.990 --> 39:22.648
Yes.

39:23.411 --> 39:25.361
I want to get
started immediately.

39:28.109 --> 39:30.046
You can stay over if you like.

39:32.054 --> 39:33.263
Get some dinner,

39:34.496 --> 39:36.169
do a little studying...

39:43.179 --> 39:43.965
Kyle?

39:47.526 --> 39:48.747
Are you okay?

39:54.783 --> 39:56.368
I don't deserve you.

40:01.842 --> 40:03.521
That is so sweet.

40:14.596 --> 40:15.665
I'll be right back.

40:15.835 --> 40:16.531
Okay.

40:35.801 --> 40:36.823
Shawn...

40:37.645 --> 40:39.347
this is Olivia Cohen.

40:39.441 --> 40:40.709
Take a seat here.

40:40.744 --> 40:41.625
Mm-hmm.

40:42.764 --> 40:44.455
That's good.

40:44.971 --> 40:48.534
She lost her eyesight to macular
degeneration 10 years ago.

40:48.687 --> 40:51.787
The foundation was
very moved by her story.

40:53.355 --> 40:54.459
Hi, Mrs. Cohen.

40:54.612 --> 40:55.281
Hello.

40:55.316 --> 40:56.984
It's nice to meet you.
So, uh,

40:57.817 --> 40:59.320
what we're going to do here

40:59.579 --> 41:01.669
is going to feel
a little weird, but

41:01.821 --> 41:03.005
when we're done,

41:03.216 --> 41:04.449
you'll be able to see again.

41:04.778 --> 41:06.280
Oh, i can't wait.

41:06.915 --> 41:09.028
I have to admit,
i'm a little nervous.

41:09.063 --> 41:10.590
You don't have to be.

41:11.306 --> 41:13.138
I'm going to take
your hands now, okay?

41:13.385 --> 41:14.183
Mm-hmm.

41:17.025 --> 41:18.046
Here we go.

41:18.584 --> 41:19.512
Here we go.

41:50.053 --> 41:52.964
So when does it start?
When do i see again?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.456
Just give me a moment.

41:55.759 --> 41:56.440

41:56.874 --> 41:57.497
Oh...

41:59.478 --> 42:00.276

42:01.169 --> 42:02.108
