08:43.166 --> 08:45.208
I'M JUST GONNA GO SOME--
(Naomi) NO, STAY.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.041
SHE IS STAYING.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.834
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THIS.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.041
YOU CAN'T BRING IN SOMEBODY
WITHOUT A VOTE.
YEAH, THIS IS NOT--

08:52.083 --> 08:54.041
(man moaning)
THIS IS NOT A, UH--

08:54.083 --> 08:56.041
WHAT IS THAT?
JUST GET--

08:56.083 --> 08:59.208
SOMEBODY'S GETTING HAPPY.
NO, IT'S MR. WILSON
GIVING A SPERM DEPOSIT.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.041
GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR.
THAT'S A LOUD DEPOSIT.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.041
GO, MR. WILSON.
YOU GUYS ARE SO IMMATURE.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.208
THIS IS, UH,
DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
(Cooper) DO YOU THINK
HE'S ALWAYS THAT LOUD?

09:06.250 --> 09:08.792
'CAUSE HIS NEIGHBORS HAVE GOT TO
BE MAKING NOISE COMPLAINTS.
JUST GO.

09:08.834 --> 09:10.125
HELP! PLEASE, COME QUICK.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.834
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP HIM
GET IN THE MOOD,

09:12.875 --> 09:15.667
AND NOW HE'S NOT MOVING.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

09:15.709 --> 09:17.500
HIS PUPIL'S BLOWN.
HE'S HAVING A STROKE.

09:17.542 --> 09:21.041
(siren wails)
ALL RIGHT, HE'S HAD
THREE ROUNDS OF EPI

09:21.083 --> 09:23.083
AND A 200 LIDO BOLUS.
DEFIB TIMES 5 ON SCENE.

09:23.125 --> 09:26.083
GET OUT OF MY WAY. HOLD C.P.R.
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DOWN?

09:26.125 --> 09:29.041
UH, AT LEAST 20 MINUTES.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.166
I'M GONNA CALL IT.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.875
WHAT? WHAT ABOUT THOSE?

09:34.917 --> 09:37.166
DON'T YOU WANT
THE SHOCKY THINGS?
HE'S BEEN DOWN TOO LONG.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.083
NO POINT IN TURNING THIS
INTO A SHOW.
NO! NO!
USE THE SHOCKY THINGS.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.041
I'M SORRY. HE'S GONE.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.709
(woman) TIME OF DEATH--
9:42 A.M.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.041
(sobs)

09:47.083 --> 09:48.500
NO.

09:48.542 --> 09:51.041
WE--WE WERE
GONNA HAVE A BABY.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.667
HE WAS--
HE WAS GONNA BE A DAD.

09:53.709 --> 09:55.792
(sobs)

09:59.083 --> 10:00.500
I-I-I WANT--

10:00.542 --> 10:03.458
I WANT--
I WANT HIS SPERM.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.083
UH, HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE HIS--HIS DONATION

10:07.125 --> 10:08.875
B-BEFORE HE DIED.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.041
BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT
FROM HIM NOW.
(both) WHAT?

10:11.083 --> 10:12.917
I WANT HIS SPERM.

10:12.959 --> 10:15.917
(crying)
I WANT KEN'S SPERM NOW!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.583
(Violet) I GET NAOMI'S MAD--
HELL HATH NO FURY AND ALL THAT.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.583
AND I KNOW THE PRACTICE NEEDS
AN O.B.-G.Y.N.,

10:29.625 --> 10:31.750
BUT SINCE WHEN
DO WE NOT VOTE?

10:31.792 --> 10:34.041
I HAD SEX
WITH THIS WOMAN LAST NIGHT.
THE REASON WE STARTED
THIS PRACTICE

10:34.083 --> 10:36.709
IS SO WE COULD BE IN CHARGE
OF OUR OWN DESTINY.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.709
VERY REAL, YOU KNOW,
INTERNET SEX.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.667
BUT SHE WANTED ME
TO CALL HER MAMA,

10:40.709 --> 10:43.667
BUT SHE PROMISED ALL THIS
REALLY FREAKY STUFF,

10:43.709 --> 10:47.166
AND I'M TALKIN', LIKE,
STUFF.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.750
OKAY. (laughs) EWW.
THAT'S IT. I'M DONE.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.041
NO. WHAT? WHY?

10:51.083 --> 10:53.750
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SEX ADDICT
OR AN INTERNET ADDICT

10:53.792 --> 10:56.917
OR SOME KIND
OF FREAKY ADDICT.
YEAH, AND YOU'RE A STALKER.

10:56.959 --> 11:00.041
YOU'RE STALKING
YOUR MARRIED EX-BOYFRIEND.
I AM NOT.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.041
I'M... C-CALLING HIM
OCCASIONALLY.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.792
STALKER.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

11:04.834 --> 11:07.291
I--I'M CUTTING YOU OFF,
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.208
YOU AIN'T GETTIN' NO HELP
FROM ME.
OH, COME ON, STALKER.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.291
I'M NOT A STALKER!
(pager beeps)

11:13.333 --> 11:15.500
HEY. I, UH...

11:15.542 --> 11:18.041
JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I AM REALLY SORRY

11:18.083 --> 11:20.542
ABOUT NAOMI AND THE JOB. I--

11:20.583 --> 11:22.458
I GOT A 9-1-1 PAGE.

11:25.083 --> 11:29.083
(sighs)

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

11:31.083 --> 11:33.041
WITH, UH, HAVING SEX
WITH A WOMAN

11:33.083 --> 11:38.125
WHO WANTS YOU TO CALL HER...
MAMA?

11:38.166 --> 11:39.166
UH...

11:39.208 --> 11:41.792
THERE'S A PATIENT FOR YOU.
THANK GOD.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.125
NO, NOT HIM. YOU.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.792
UH, THIS IS BILL HENDERSON
AND HIS DAUGHTER LUCY.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.041
THIS IS DR. MONTGOMERY.
SHE'LL BE DELIVERING YOUR BABY.
HI.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.583
OW! (whimpers)
YEAH, IT HURTS.
IT HURTS, DOESN'T IT?

11:52.625 --> 11:54.583
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR GETTING PREGNANT.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.792
SHE HID IT FROM ME FOR MONTHS,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

11:57.834 --> 12:01.000
IT'S, "DADDY, I'M IN LABOR."
HOW ABOUT WE GET YOU
INTO THE BIRTHING SUITE?

12:01.041 --> 12:03.250
DELL, SEE IF WE HAVE A CHART
ON LUCY.
HEY, CAN I GET IN ON THIS?

12:03.291 --> 12:05.667
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A LOT OF FIELD EXPERIENCE

12:05.709 --> 12:08.417
FOR MY MIDWIFE TRAINING.
I-I NEED THE HOURS.
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST FIND
THE CHART?

12:08.458 --> 12:10.250
(Sam) KEN'S SPERM...

12:10.291 --> 12:13.250
YOU WANT US TO TAKE KEN'S SPERM
RIGHT OUT OF...

12:13.291 --> 12:16.041
ARE YOU SURE?

12:16.083 --> 12:17.709
I'M SURE.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.041
I MEAN, YOU CAN DO IT,
RIGHT?
LOOK HERE.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.709
YOU'RE DISTRESSED.
I UNDERSTAND.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.041
BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE WRITTEN
CONSENT FROM THE DECEASED,

12:24.083 --> 12:26.041
NO WAY AM I GONNA LET YOU
MOLEST YOUR HUSBAND'S CORPSE.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.041
WELL...
OKAY, WELL,
LET'S NOT USE WORDS

12:28.083 --> 12:31.000
LIKE, UH, "MOLEST" OR "CORPSE"
ABOUT HER LOVED ONE.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.000
AND IT'S HER BOYFRIEND,
NOT HER HUSBAND.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.417
OH. WELL, FINE.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.125
SHE WANTS SPERM OF A MAN
SHE HAS NO LEGAL RIGHTS TO.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.083
THAT MAKES IT ALL BETTER.
NO.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.458
W--

12:40.500 --> 12:42.333
OKAY. HEY, LET'S--

12:42.375 --> 12:44.291
CAN WE STOP--
UH, CHARLOTTE, RIGHT?

12:44.333 --> 12:47.291
YOU KNOW MY NAME, SAM.
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.542
I'M CHIEF OF STAFF HERE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
(sobs)

12:49.583 --> 12:52.625
YOU AND I, WE--WE CAN WORK
ON THIS TOGETHER.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.125
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD PERSON,

12:55.166 --> 12:56.625
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.250
WE--I MEAN WE CAN--

12:58.291 --> 13:00.709
RIGHT?
WE CAN... TOGETHER?

13:00.750 --> 13:03.291
I DID READ YOUR BOOK,
BY THE WAY.
OH, GREAT.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.750
I TOOK ISSUE
WITH MOST OF IT.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.041
SEE, NOW I'M ON HER SIDE.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.083
WE WANT KEN'S SPERM, OR YOU GOT
A FIGHT ON YOUR HANDS.

13:15.125 --> 13:18.041
THAT DEAD MAN'S SWIMMERS ARE
STAYING EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.

13:18.083 --> 13:21.250
YOU GOT A WAY TO FIGHT ME ON
THAT, I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.000
OH.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.208
I'M CALLING NAOMI ON YOU.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.166
LUCY HENDERSON.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.250
UH, SHE WAS MY PATIENT
TILL SHE GOT PREGNANT.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.500
NO PREVIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS.
IT LOOKS GOOD.
MM-HMM.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.041
WELL, THE DAD IS MAD AS HELL.
I COULD USE YOUR HELP IN THERE.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.041
OH, UH, YEAH. NO. THAT...
DOWN THERE IS NOT MY AREA.

13:39.083 --> 13:42.709
SO WHEN THE BABY COMES OUT,
I'D BE HAPPY TO EXAMINE IT.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.208
UNTIL THEN, GODSPEED.
(chuckles)

13:44.250 --> 13:47.917
GIVE ME TWO SECS TO GRAB MY KIT.
I'LL JOIN YOU.
FOR?

13:47.959 --> 13:49.625
IF YOU'D READ FURTHER
IN HER CHART,

13:49.667 --> 13:51.625
YOU'D SEE SHE HAS
A HOLISTIC BIRTH PLAN.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.166
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LABORING MOMS LOVE PETE.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.041
HEY, LISTEN, UM...

13:57.083 --> 13:59.917
YOU MOVING HERE, THAT DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

13:59.959 --> 14:02.000
WITH ME KISSING YOU, DID IT?
WHAT?

14:02.041 --> 14:03.750
IT'S OKAY. IT'S JUST THAT--

14:03.792 --> 14:06.125
WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW
IT WAS JUST A KISS.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.542
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU THINK
THAT I MOVED HERE

14:08.583 --> 14:11.834
BECAUSE YOU KISSED ME?
IT WAS A GOOD KISS.
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT KISS.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.083
BUT--
STOP TALKING.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.834
(laughs) ALL RIGHT.

14:14.875 --> 14:17.041
I DID NOT MOVE HERE
BECAUSE YOU KISSED ME.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.542
(laughs)
OKAY.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.542
YOU ARE ACTUALLY
DERANGED ENOUGH TO THINK

14:20.583 --> 14:22.625
THAT I WOULD PICK UP
MY ENTIRE LIFE

14:22.667 --> 14:24.333
AND MOVE
BECAUSE OF A KISS?

14:24.375 --> 14:27.041
LET ME CLEAR THAT UP FOR YOU.
I WOULDN'T.
OKAY.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.166
SHUT UP.
JUST--JUST GO IN THERE

14:29.208 --> 14:32.166
AND DO YOUR LITTLE EASTERN
VOODOO THING YOU DO,

14:32.208 --> 14:36.000
AND LET'S HELP THAT GIRL
HAVE HER BABY IN PEACE.

14:40.583 --> 14:43.250
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?
HE WAS YOUR PATIENT.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.041
MY PATIENT'S DEAD.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.041
THIS IS ABOUT YOUR PATIENT
WHO WANTS A DEAD MAN'S SPERM.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.208
BESIDES, I GOT MAD.
YOU GOT MAD?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.583
I GOT MAD.
YOU GOT MAD?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.375
APPARENTLY NEITHER ONE OF US
CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

14:53.417 --> 14:56.250
WHEN WE'RE MAD.
ANOTHER DOCTOR IN THE PRACTICE
WHO CAN BILL

14:56.291 --> 14:58.250
IS A VERY GOOD DECISION.
WE AGREED THAT WHEN WE SPLIT,

14:58.291 --> 15:01.083
WE WOULD NOT LET IT AFFECT
THE WORK.
MY WORK IS FINE.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.500
(Naomi) IN FACT, WATCH ME
TAKE CARE OF MY PATIENT.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.250
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

15:06.291 --> 15:08.291
IF THE HOSPITAL'S NOT GONNA
TOUCH THE BODY, THEN I WILL.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.208
YOU LAY A HAND ON THAT MAN,
AND I WILL HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.250
I'M NOT A PERSON WHO PLAYS
GAMES, NAOMI. YOU KNOW THAT.

15:13.291 --> 15:15.500
NOW PLEASE STEP BACK.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.750
OKAY, NOW I'M MAD.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.458
I TOLD YOU.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.041
(sighs)

15:31.083 --> 15:34.834
YOU KNOW, I-I-I COULD HELP.
YOU KNOW, WITH LUCY.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.208
I'M GOOD.
YOU DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.083
WHAT?

15:39.125 --> 15:41.500
YOU THINK I'M DUMB SURFER BOY.
YOU THINK I'M EYE CANDY.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.250
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ME
OR MY MIDWIFERY SKILLS.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.250
I HAVE...
TOTAL RESPECT FOR YOU

15:46.291 --> 15:49.417
AND YOUR... MIDWIFERY SKILLS?

15:49.458 --> 15:52.041
IS--IS THAT EVEN A WORD,
MIDWIFERY?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.291
IT'S A WORD.

15:54.333 --> 15:58.041
IT'S DEFINITELY A WORD.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.542
(scoffs)

15:59.583 --> 16:01.500
(Violet) EXCUSE ME.
I GOT A PAGE.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.500
(woman muttering indistinctly)

16:03.542 --> 16:07.083
9,242. 9,243. 9,244.
9,245...

16:07.125 --> 16:08.583
JENNY?

16:08.625 --> 16:11.375
(man) SHE'S BEEN COUNTING
THE TILES FOR OVER AN HOUR.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.875
YOU KNOW THIS LADY?

16:13.917 --> 16:15.291
YES, I DO.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.667
9,255. 9,256. 9,257...

16:17.709 --> 16:19.917
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO HER?

16:19.959 --> 16:21.792
9,262. 9,263.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.667
9,264. 9,265.

16:24.709 --> 16:27.041
9,266. 9,2...

16:29.083 --> 16:30.166
9,294...

16:30.208 --> 16:32.041
SHE HAD YOUR CARD
IN HER WALLET.

16:32.083 --> 16:34.709
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME.

16:34.750 --> 16:38.041
MY SISTER,
SHE'S GOT MENTAL PROBLEMS.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.166
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON,
BUT SHE'S GOT MENTAL PROBLEMS.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.959
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU
BEFORE I CALLED THE COPS.
OH, Y-YOU--

16:43.000 --> 16:45.959
WE DON'T NEED THE POLICE.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
CAN YOU DO IT QUICK?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.417
I MEAN, SHE CAN'T STAY
ON THE FLOOR LIKE THAT.

16:48.458 --> 16:51.417
SHE'S OBSTRUCTING CUSTOMER FLOW
AND IF SHE'S DANG--
LOOK, IF YOU GIVE ME
SOME TIME,

16:51.458 --> 16:53.542
I WILL TAKE HER
OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.041
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME,
UH, "PAUL"? CAN YOU DO THAT?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.041
I GUESS.
THANK YOU.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.083
9,332. 9,333. 9,334.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.542
9,335. 9,336.

17:03.583 --> 17:07.041
9,337. 9,338. 9,339.

17:07.083 --> 17:10.041
9,340. 9,341.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.041
9,342.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.333
9,343. 9,344.

17:14.375 --> 17:17.041
9,345. 9,346.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.959
9,347.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.041
9,348. 9,349...

17:22.083 --> 17:24.041
YOU'RE GETTING CHARGED
BY THE HOUR,

17:24.083 --> 17:26.208
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HEAR ME.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.750
(Pete) INHALE.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.250
EXHALE.
OOH.

17:29.291 --> 17:31.417
FOCUS ON ME. EXHALE.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.041
DEEP BREATHS.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.000
IN. OUT.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.083
GOOD.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.875
GOOD. MUCH BETTER.

17:37.917 --> 17:40.041
(exhales)

17:40.083 --> 17:42.083
MY DAD, HE--HE'S JUST MAD.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.083
I-I WANT THIS BABY.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.792
I-I JUST--
I SCREWED UP.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.458
I'M SUCH A SCREWUP.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.041
HEY, LUCY...

17:52.083 --> 17:53.834
LISTEN...

17:53.875 --> 17:57.041
EVERYONE SCREWS UP
ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.417
AND IN THIS ROOM,
YOU GET A FREE PASS.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.166
OKAY?

18:01.208 --> 18:04.000
OKAY.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.291
THESE ARE KEN AND LESLIE'S
MEDICAL RECORDS,

18:09.333 --> 18:12.333
INCLUDING KEN'S SIGNATURE
ON A CONTRACT WITH MY OFFICE

18:12.375 --> 18:14.041
REGARDING HIS DONATION.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.333
NOW I THINK THAT IS
MORE THAN IMPLIED.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.333
LIVE CONSENT IS DIFFERENT--

18:18.375 --> 18:20.125
YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.417
IT COULD BE PERSUASIVE
IN COURT.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.041
YOUR PATIENT
WILL SIGN SOMETHING

18:24.083 --> 18:25.709
INDEMNIFYING US
AGAINST LEGAL ACTION?

18:25.750 --> 18:28.959
SHE JUST WANTS HER BABY.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.959
FINE.
YOU DO THE PROCEDURE.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.959
YOU TAKE POSSESSION
OF THE SPERM.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.125
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.083
WELL DONE.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.250
VERY BADASS.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.709
I KNOW. RIGHT?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.250
GET AWAY FROM ME.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.750
IT'S GOOD.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.375
ARE YOU DR. NAOMI BENNETT?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.375
I AM.
YOU BETTER GET THAT
LITTLE TRAMP'S CLAWS

18:49.417 --> 18:51.542
OFF MY HUSBAND'S SPERM,
OR I WILL SUE YOU

18:51.583 --> 18:54.041
AND THIS PLACE SO FAST,
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN.
WHO ARE YOU?

18:54.083 --> 18:56.333
I'M KEN WILSON'S WIFE.

18:59.083 --> 19:02.041
JENNY, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO MAKE YOU FEEL OUT OF CONTROL

19:02.083 --> 19:04.041
HERE IN THE STORE?
(muttering indistinctly)

19:04.083 --> 19:06.041
OKAY, WELL, WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON RAGE

19:06.083 --> 19:08.041
DIRECTED TOWARD YOUR HUSBAND
FOR LEAVING YOU.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.500
ARE--ARE YOU ANGRY?

19:09.542 --> 19:11.041
(muttering continues)

19:11.083 --> 19:12.500
TH-THAT'S OKAY.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.041
FEEL THE FEELINGS.
GET ANGRY.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.917
LET--LET'S TALK ABOUT
GETTING ANGRY.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.125
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.917
YEAH, I GOT THAT, PAUL.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.333
NOW WHAT'S THE DEAL?

19:21.375 --> 19:24.041
SHE, UH, GETS UPSET, SO SHE
GOES CRAZY WITH THE COUNTING?

19:24.083 --> 19:26.041
WELL, FOR MANY PEOPLE
COUNTING ESTABLISHES...

19:26.083 --> 19:27.375
A SENSE OF ORDER.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.417
OH, MY GOD.
WHEN DID MY KNEES TURN 80?

19:29.458 --> 19:33.041
WE GOT KNEE PADS
ON AISLE EIGHT.
NO.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.583
HEY, JENNY...
(muttering continues)

19:34.625 --> 19:36.583
CAN YOU LOOK UP AT ME?

19:36.625 --> 19:38.709
CAN YOU--
CAN YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES?

19:38.750 --> 19:41.583
COME ON, JENNY.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.583
AAH!
(Paul) WHOA. WHOA.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.375
WHOA. WHOA.
(screaming)

19:45.417 --> 19:47.166
(gasps and mutters)

19:47.208 --> 19:48.959
YOU OKAY?
YES, I'M FINE.

19:49.041 --> 19:50.208
YOU SURE?
YES.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.125
(Jenny mutters)

19:52.166 --> 19:54.041
10,168. 10,169.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.333
10,170. 10,171.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.166
10,172. 10,17...

19:59.208 --> 20:02.375
(exhales)

20:02.417 --> 20:05.166
JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING, ANY HELP.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.000
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.000
(chuckles)

20:08.041 --> 20:10.375
OKAY, LUCY,
YOU READY TO PUSH?

20:10.417 --> 20:12.667
PLEASE.
UH, MR. HENDERSON,

20:12.709 --> 20:14.667
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
GONNA START PUSHING NOW.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.959
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME
AND SIT BY HER SIDE?
FOR WHAT?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.166
(groans)

20:19.208 --> 20:22.041
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SQUEEZE MY HAND,

20:22.083 --> 20:24.625
OKAY, IF YOU NEED TO?
OKAY.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.291
OKAY.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.417
(breathes deeply)

20:27.458 --> 20:28.875
LUCY, YOU READY?

20:28.917 --> 20:31.458
YEAH.
OKAY, GO AHEAD AND PUSH.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.917
(groans)

20:32.959 --> 20:35.041
GOOD. PUSH.
(grunts)

20:35.083 --> 20:38.000
GOOD. GOOD. PUSH.
(groans)

20:38.041 --> 20:40.709
(monitor beeping)

20:40.750 --> 20:43.166
THAT'S GOOD. PUSH.
(groans)

20:43.208 --> 20:46.041
(gasps)
STOP. STOP.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.917
SHE'S SHORT OF BREATH
WITH J.V.D.
I THOUGHT EASTERN MEDICINE
WAS YOUR THING.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.166
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.041
NOW SHE'S SHORT OF BREATH
WITH J.V.D.

20:53.083 --> 20:56.250
DO YOU WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK
OR YOU GONNA TRUST ME?

20:56.291 --> 20:58.333
(monitor beeping)

20:58.375 --> 21:01.041
THE BABY'S IN DISTRESS.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.417
OKAY, LUCY, DON'T PUSH
FOR RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

21:03.458 --> 21:06.041
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE, OKAY?

21:06.083 --> 21:07.917
DR. MONTGOMERY,
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH HER.

21:07.959 --> 21:09.291
LUCY? LUCY.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.208
LUCY, WAKE UP.
LUCY, WAKE UP.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.083
LUCY? OKAY, GET HER ON
HIGH-FLOW OXYGEN.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.083
GET AN AMBULANCE, DELL.
I WAS JUST HOLDING HER HAND.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.291
SHE'S GOING INTO
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, DELL.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.041
AMBULANCE, NOW!

21:19.083 --> 21:21.125
LUCY, HONEY? HER MOM DIED...
IN CHILDBIRTH.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.250
SHE--SHE DIED HAVING LUCY.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.250
(beeping continues)

21:28.166 --> 21:30.125
I'M APPLYING PRESSURE,
BUT THE CORD IS COMPRESSED...

21:30.166 --> 21:32.959
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?
AND LUCY'S BLOOD
IS FLOODING HER LUNGS,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.041
AND THE UMBILICAL CORD

21:35.083 --> 21:38.667
IS CUTTING OFF
THE BABY'S BLOOD SUPPLY.
I JUST CALLED THE AMBULANCE.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.291
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR
AN AMBULANCE TO GET HERE?
10 TO 20 MINUTES IN TRAFFIC.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.291
ADDISON, WE DON'T HAVE
10 TO 20 MINUTES.
I KNOW.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.917
WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER
AND THE BABY.
I KNOW.

21:46.959 --> 21:49.750
(sighs)

21:59.750 --> 22:02.291
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.500
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.542
THAT AND THE ICE PACK--
AND THE FLIP-FLOPS,

22:06.583 --> 22:08.083
UH, BUT...
THANKS.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.583
YOU OKAY?

22:09.625 --> 22:12.291
YEAH. IT'S JUST...

22:12.333 --> 22:15.041
LOOK, I KNOW HER. SHE'S BEEN
COMING TO SEE ME FOR MONTHS.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.750
AND SHE'S GENTLE.
72. 73. 74. 75...

22:16.792 --> 22:18.041
(police radio chatter)

22:18.083 --> 22:19.959
PAUL!

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T THINK...

22:22.041 --> 22:24.542
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
EXACTLY HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.041
I DO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.375
THERE HAS GOTTA BE SOMETHING
HERE THAT I'M NOT SEEING,

22:28.417 --> 22:31.041
SOMETHING SHE'S NOT TELLING ME.
NO OFFENSE, BUT IF SHE'S NOT
TELLING HER SHRINK THINGS,

22:31.083 --> 22:33.041
THEN YOU MUST NOT BE
VERY GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?
PATIENTS HOLD THINGS IN, PAUL.

22:35.333 --> 22:38.041
THEY HOLD THINGS IN FOR YEARS.
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE ICE PACK?

22:38.083 --> 22:40.542
JUST DO--DO NOT--
DO NOT TOUCH HER.
I'M SORRY, VIOLET.
WE HAVE TO--

22:40.583 --> 22:42.750
PAUL, THINK OF YOUR SISTER.
PLEASE.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.750
YOU KNOW, I'M--
I'M WORKING HERE, COOPER.
REALLY? IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE SHOPPING.

22:45.792 --> 22:48.041
IT'S A JOKE. LOOK,
DELL TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.166
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME BY,
SEE IF YOU NEEDED ANY HELP.
NO, I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP, OKAY?

22:51.208 --> 22:53.875
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS--
YOU GOT IN YOUR CAR, YOU DROVE

22:53.917 --> 22:57.125
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE TO SEE
IF I WAS STILL MAD AT YOU?

22:57.166 --> 22:59.208
WHO IS THE STALKER NOW?
LET--LET'S JUST ALL SETTLE DOWN.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.125
I'M SORRY.
I GOTTA LET 'EM TAKE HER.

23:01.166 --> 23:04.458
IF SHE GETS VIOLENT
WITH YOU AGAIN--
VIOLENT?
SHE GOT VIOLENT WITH YOU?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.959
COME...
JUST--YOUR PUPILS--
NOT NOW, COOPER.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.959
LOOK, THIS IS
A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
I CAN STABILIZE HER.

23:12.041 --> 23:15.041
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE AND GIVE
ME BACKUP IF I NEED IT.

23:15.083 --> 23:18.250
I JUST FEEL... I--
IF--IF I KNEW HOW IT STARTED

23:18.291 --> 23:20.250
OR WHERE SHE WAS
WHEN IT HAPPENED...

23:20.291 --> 23:23.250
SO... HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT
HOW IT STARTED?

23:26.041 --> 23:29.000
YOU--YOU HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS,
DON'T YOU?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.291
(woman) HE TOLD ME
HE WANTED TO FIND HIMSELF

23:31.333 --> 23:33.291
TURNS OUT
HE WANTED TO FIND ME,

23:33.333 --> 23:35.291
ONLY 15 YEARS YOUNGER
AND HALF AS SMART.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.291
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT'S LIKE?
I THINK I CAN IMAGINE.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.792
LIKE I DON'T FEEL MY AGE,
I DON'T FEEL SCARED?

23:39.834 --> 23:42.792
ONLY I FEEL IT ALONE
WHILE HE'S YANKING IN A CUP

23:42.834 --> 23:44.834
FOR SOME CHICK HE MET
HIKING IN SEDONA.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.834
MARIA, I-I KNOW THIS IS UNFAIR.
I UNDERSTAND, BELIEVE ME.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.834
YOU KNOW,
I WAS WITH HIM 17 YEARS.

23:49.875 --> 23:52.542
MARIA, KEN REALLY WANTED LESLIE
TO HAVE HIS BABY.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.083
AND LESLIE WANTS LESLIE
TO HAVE KEN'S MONEY.

23:55.125 --> 23:57.875
I DON'T THINK
THAT SHE WOULD DO THAT.

23:57.917 --> 24:00.959
I DIDN'T THINK MY HUSBAND
WOULD DUMP ME. SO THERE YOU GO.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.875
UH, IF--IF YOU WANT
PROTECTION--

24:02.917 --> 24:04.417
LEGAL PROTECTION--

24:04.458 --> 24:07.542
I THINK THAT LESLIE WOULD AGREE
TO WHATEVER YOU ASK.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.041
I DON'T WANT PROTECTION.
I WANT KEN'S SPERM.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.291
WHAT?

24:11.333 --> 24:14.667
FOR MYSELF.

24:14.709 --> 24:17.583
NOW WE'LL SEE
WHO ENDS UP ALONE, RIGHT?

24:19.625 --> 24:21.667
WHERE THE HELL
IS THE AMBULANCE?

24:21.709 --> 24:23.667
ADDISON,
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

24:23.709 --> 24:25.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MAKE A CHOICE?

24:25.417 --> 24:27.375
IF I WAIT ANY LONGER
FOR THE AMBULANCE,

24:27.417 --> 24:30.083
I COULD LOSE THEM BOTH.

24:30.125 --> 24:33.792
OR I COULD GET THE BABY OUT
AND MAYBE SAVE THEM.
SAVE THEM, OF COURSE.

24:33.834 --> 24:37.250
MAYBE. MAYBE SAVE THEM.
DELL, GLOVE UP.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.709
I NEED YOU TO DECOMPRESS
THE CORD. COME HERE.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.458
OKAY, LIKE THIS?

24:42.500 --> 24:44.333
YES, THAT'S GOOD.
STEADY PRESSURE.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.917
OKAY, OKAY.

24:45.959 --> 24:48.959
(monitor beeping)

24:51.583 --> 24:53.542
I NEED TO BE IN A HOSPITAL.

24:53.583 --> 24:56.041
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PERFORM
A C-SECTION HERE.

24:56.083 --> 24:59.041
IT'S NOT STERILE. I DON'T HAVE
ANY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT...
ADDISON--

24:59.083 --> 25:01.041
NO EXTRA BLOOD
AND AN EPIDURAL WOULD TAKE

25:01.083 --> 25:04.583
WAY TOO LONG TO TAKE EFFECT.
ADDISON, SHE'S A COMPLETELY
HEALTHY 17 YEAR OLD.

25:04.625 --> 25:07.583
NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN
THIS COMPLICATION.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO A PERSON

25:07.625 --> 25:10.041
WHEN A SCALPEL SLICES INTO THEM
WITHOUT ANESTHESIA?
ADDISON, I--

25:10.083 --> 25:12.041
SHUT UP!

25:12.083 --> 25:14.041
I AM TRYING TO TALK MYSELF
INTO THIS,

25:14.083 --> 25:17.041
AND I CANNOT DO IT
WHEN YOU KEEP ADDISONing ME.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.750
SO JUST... (exhales)
HOLD ON.

25:29.083 --> 25:31.333
OKAY.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.000
PETE, TAKE OVER FOR DELL.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.583
DELL, GO FIND A SURGICAL TRAY
FROM SOMEWHERE.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.166
SHE'S GONNA FEEL EVERY SLICE,
BUT WE HAVE TO TRY.
ADDISON--

25:38.208 --> 25:40.583
I AM GOING TO SCRUB IN
AND FIND STERILE DRAPES.

25:40.625 --> 25:42.583
WE HAVE
A LOCAL ANESTHETIC, RIGHT?

25:42.625 --> 25:44.583
THAT WILL HELP
WITH THE PAIN.
ADDISON.

25:44.625 --> 25:48.208
STOP ADDISONing ME.
I CAN TREAT HER
SO SHE WON'T FEEL ANY PAIN.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.417
THE CAMERAS SHOW HER
ON THIS AISLE.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.875
SHE STOPPED. NEXT THING,
SHE'S LOOKING AT THE FLOOR.

25:54.917 --> 25:56.875
(Cooper) MAYBE SOME KIND
OF CAMPING ACCIDENT?

25:56.917 --> 26:00.041
SOMETHING TRAUMATIC?
(Paul) OR MAY--
MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

26:00.083 --> 26:02.041
THIS GUY, UH, HE WORKS HERE,

26:02.083 --> 26:04.458
HE--HE TOLD ME
THAT MARSHMALLOW GETS SO HOT

26:04.500 --> 26:06.458
IT STICKS LIKE NAPALM.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.041
THAT'S NOT THAT BAD,
I GUESS.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.750
(Cooper) NOT BAD ENOUGH
FOR TILE COUNTING.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.667
THEY HAD A HOUSE AT THE LAKE.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.583
I'VE STIMULATED THE NEEDLES.
LIDOCAINE'S IN.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.417
HER PAIN RECEPTORS
ARE BLOCKED. SHE'S READY.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.667
ARE YOU SURE SHE'S NOT
GONNA FEEL ANYTHING?
I'M SURE.

26:23.709 --> 26:26.041
BECAUSE IF SHE WAKES UP
SCREAMING IN PAIN--

26:26.083 --> 26:28.166
I'M SURE.
I'M VERY GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

26:28.208 --> 26:31.917
ARE YOU REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY SURE?
TRUST ME.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.250
OKAY.

26:35.291 --> 26:38.083
HERE WE GO.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.750
I'M GONNA CUT ON THREE.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.583
ONE...

26:46.875 --> 26:48.875
TWO...

26:51.125 --> 26:53.083
THREE.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.709

38:47.083 --> 38:48.792
THE THING IS, COOPER--

38:48.834 --> 38:52.959
OKAY, THE THING IS THAT...

38:53.000 --> 38:55.625
I AM KIND OF A STALKER.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.291
I KNOW.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.291
(imitates rod casting)

38:59.333 --> 39:01.959
(imitates bait
hitting water)

39:07.834 --> 39:10.792
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM
I WAS COMING?

39:10.834 --> 39:12.834
TRUTH.

39:14.083 --> 39:17.083
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

39:17.125 --> 39:20.041
I NEED YOU HERE. OKAY?

39:20.083 --> 39:21.333
I NEED YOU HERE...

39:21.375 --> 39:24.250
BECAUSE I'M... TIRED
AND I'M LONELY,

39:24.291 --> 39:27.333
AND MY BEST FRIEND
DIVORCED ME,

39:27.375 --> 39:29.041
AND I HAVE NO ONE.

39:29.083 --> 39:32.208
I NEED YOU HERE
TO BE MY SOMEONE.

39:34.417 --> 39:36.000
OKAY.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.041
(elevator bell dings)

39:44.208 --> 39:47.041
UH, WE WANT TO SEE YOU
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM...

39:47.083 --> 39:49.375
IF THAT'S OKAY--
I MEAN NOW.

39:55.083 --> 39:57.375
(Violet) WE'RE A TEAM.
WE'RE PARTNERS, NAOMI.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.667
(Sam) YOU CAN'T JUST
BRING SOMEBODY IN.
(Pete) WITHOUT ASKING US.

39:59.709 --> 40:01.792
(Cooper) YEAH.
WE'RE A DEMOCRACY. WE VOTE.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.250
WE VOTE.
WE VOTE.

40:03.291 --> 40:06.041
WE VOTE OR IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.583
WE SHOULD'VE VOTED.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.250
I WAS WRONG.

40:11.291 --> 40:12.792
GOOD.

40:12.834 --> 40:14.166
OKAY, LET'S VOTE.

40:14.208 --> 40:17.583
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

40:17.625 --> 40:22.166
UH, I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE
LESS THAN 24 HOURS,

40:22.208 --> 40:23.917
AND IN THAT TIME

40:23.959 --> 40:26.834
I DISCOVERED THAT
I AM NOT WELCOME HERE,

40:26.875 --> 40:29.542
I LEARNED I AM
A ONE-MAN GYNIE SHOW,

40:29.583 --> 40:33.333
AND I PERFORMED
CRAZY MacGYVER SURGERY,

40:33.375 --> 40:36.041
AND... SAM SAW MY BOOTY.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.041
(laughs) SO... THIS HAS NOT
BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR ME.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.333
THIS DAY KIND OF SUCKED.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:41.375 --> 40:43.041
I HAD ONE PATIENT--

40:43.083 --> 40:46.041
ONE PATIENT
THE ENTIRE DAY--

40:46.083 --> 40:48.208
AND I LOVED IT.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.041
SO YOU WANT ME GONE?

40:50.083 --> 40:53.041
TOO BAD. I'M IN.

40:53.083 --> 40:56.041
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.
MY FOOT'S DOWN.

40:56.083 --> 40:59.208
IT'S DOWN.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

40:59.250 --> 41:02.583
SO...

41:02.625 --> 41:04.041
YEAH.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.875
I THOUGHT I...

41:06.917 --> 41:10.709
I THOUGHT I HAD
A BIG FINISH BUT...

41:10.750 --> 41:12.041
I DON'T.

41:12.083 --> 41:13.750
SO...

41:15.083 --> 41:17.083
I'M DONE.

41:21.417 --> 41:24.041
NO, NO.

41:24.083 --> 41:26.208
I DO HAVE A BIG FINISH.

41:28.583 --> 41:31.542
IF I HADN'T BEEN HERE TODAY,
IF YOU'D HAD SOMEONE ELSE,

41:31.583 --> 41:34.000
THAT GIRL WOULD'VE DIED
DELIVERING HER BABY.

41:34.041 --> 41:36.041
I SAVED HER LIFE.

41:36.083 --> 41:39.041
I SAVED YOUR ASSES.

41:39.083 --> 41:42.959
I'M A WORLD-CLASS
NEONATAL SURGEON.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.583
AND I'M HERE TO STAY.

41:47.417 --> 41:50.166
WELCOME TO
THE NEW OCEANSIDE WELLNESS.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.041
(Swingfly's "Something's
Got Me Started" playing)

41:53.083 --> 41:56.041
(man) YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? TAKE
YOUR SHIRT OFF FOR THIS ONE.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.500
TOSS IT UP IN THE AIR...

41:57.542 --> 42:00.250
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU
SHE WAS COMING.
