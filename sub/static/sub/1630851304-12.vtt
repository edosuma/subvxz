BETWEEN THE KINGS, THE QUEENS,

BECAME HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD...

00:48.206 --> 00:49.310

YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE

00:51.274 --> 00:54.585

KINGS WHO COULD BE CALLING THE

00:57.067 --> 00:57.481
SHOTS.

00:57.517 --> 00:59.619
>> WE'RE SO BAD.

00:59.655 --> 01:01.585
WE'RE SO BAD.

01:01.619 --> 01:03.965
>> Announcer: WHITNEY AND
HANNAH WERE ON CHRISTIAN'S HIT

01:04.000 --> 01:04.896
LIST.

01:04.930 --> 01:09.171

01:09.206 --> 01:11.412
>> Announcer: PUTTING XAVIER
IN AN AWKWARD SPOT.

>> HANNAH IS MY BABY SISTER ON
THIS TEAM AND A MEMBER OF THE

COOKOUT AND PUTS ME IN A VERY
TRICKY SITUATION.

01:17.655 --> 01:19.826
I'M ALWAYS IN TRICKY SITUATIONS
IN THIS DAMN HOUSE.

01:19.861 --> 01:24.206

JUST MYSELF.

01:32.033 --> 01:32.965
INDIVIDUAL SAFETY UNTIL JURY.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.655
I HAVE TO GO FOR THAT.

01:34.688 --> 01:35.793
OF COURSE.

01:35.826 --> 01:38.206
>> Announcer: WITH THE ROYAL
FLUSH WANTING TO SOLIDIFY

01:38.240 --> 01:39.965
NOMINEES...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.275
>> HANNAH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.655
>> I THINK THE TARGET SHOULD BE
HANNAH.

01:43.688 --> 01:45.033
>> Announcer: ...THE COOKOUT
TRIED TO SHIELD HANNAH FROM THE

01:45.067 --> 01:46.448
LINE OF FIRE.

>> I THINK THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT'S MORE OF A THREAT TO BOTH

OF OUR TEAMS, AND THAT'S
BRITINI.

01:52.171 --> 01:55.137
>> Announcer: ...WHEN RAISED
RED FLAGS WITH SARAH BETH.

01:55.171 --> 01:58.793
>> I AM SO FRUSTRATED THAT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN MY ALLIANCE

01:58.826 --> 02:02.310
DON'T SEE HANNAH AS THE TARGET
SHE IS.

02:02.343 --> 02:03.516
HUGE RED FLAG.

02:03.551 --> 02:07.034
>> Announcer: THE KING NEEDED
A PAWN SO HE HELD COURT WITH

02:07.067 --> 02:07.724
HANNAH.

02:07.757 --> 02:09.171
>> YOU'RE SAYING I'M GOING UP?

02:09.205 --> 02:10.620
JUST BE HONEST.

02:10.655 --> 02:11.413
JUST BE REAL WITH ME.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.758
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT FOR
SURE.

02:13.793 --> 02:16.343
>> Announcer: AND SHE MADE
PROMISES TO MAKE SURE SHE

02:16.378 --> 02:17.655
WOULDN'T BE TARGETED.

02:17.688 --> 02:19.620
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING UP IF I WIN,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER

02:19.655 --> 02:23.655
PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE CAN PROMISE
YOU THAT.

02:23.688 --> 02:25.723
>> Announcer: AT THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY...

02:25.758 --> 02:28.033
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU, WHITNEY,
AND YOU, HANNAH.

02:28.068 --> 02:30.688
>> Announcer: ...CHRISTIAN HAD
TWO ACES UP HIS SLEEVE.

02:30.723 --> 02:35.240
>> THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE ON
WHO THE TARGET WILL BE, EITHER

02:35.275 --> 02:40.067
HANNAH OR WHITNEY, AND MY HEAD'S
SPINNING.

02:40.103 --> 02:43.516
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, WILL
THE POWER OF VETO SAVE HANNAH OR

02:43.550 --> 02:46.000
WHITNEY FROM THE BLOCK?

02:46.033 --> 02:54.206
PLUS, IS THE ROYAL FLUSH
ALLIANCE BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE?

02:54.240 --> 02:58.275
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER."

02:58.310 --> 03:01.241
>> WHY DO YOU THINK I'M WEARING
THE HOODIE?

03:01.275 --> 03:03.655
I'M TRYING TO HIDE A LITTLE.

03:03.688 --> 03:10.171
[ LAUGHING ]
JUST KIDDING.

03:10.205 --> 03:17.758
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

03:17.793 --> 03:20.033
I NOMINATED WHITNEY AND HANNAH
THIS WEEK.

03:20.068 --> 03:24.205
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WHITNEY'S
COME AFTER THE KINGS, SO IT MADE

03:24.240 --> 03:26.205
THE MOST SENSE TO PUT WHITNEY
UP.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.413
>> YOU'RE A CHAMP, YOU GOT THIS.

03:27.448 --> 03:30.171
>> HANNAH IS ALSO ON THE SAME
TEAM AS WHITNEY, ACES, SO IT

03:30.205 --> 03:37.723
TAKES AWAY A VOTE FROM WH WHITNE
>> SORRY, WHITT, BUT WE'RE IN

03:37.758 --> 03:39.033
THIS TOGETHER.

03:39.067 --> 03:43.481
>> I FEEL REALLY BLINDSIDED AND
BACKSTABBED AND REALLY CONFUSED

03:43.516 --> 03:44.550
RIGHT NOW.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.137
I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGS.

03:46.171 --> 03:49.448
BUT FOR SOME REASON, I'M UP ON
THE BLOCK, AND I JUST HONESTLY

03:49.481 --> 03:51.378
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.

03:51.413 --> 03:56.586
LIKE, COMING INTO THIS, I DID
NOT EXPECT THINGS TO BE THIS

03:56.620 --> 03:56.930
DIFFICULT.

03:56.965 --> 03:58.067
>> SORRY.

03:58.103 --> 03:59.206
I'M REALLY SORRY.

03:59.240 --> 04:05.103
>> BEING ON THE BLOCK IS NOT
IDEAL AT ALL, POINT-BLANK,

04:05.137 --> 04:06.103
PERIOD.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.413
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT I AM THE
PAWN THIS WEEK.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.620
>> I'M SO SORRY.

04:09.655 --> 04:10.931
>> NO, THAT'S OKAY.

04:10.965 --> 04:14.758
>> SO FINGERS CROSSED, AND IF I
FIND OUT THAT HE'S TARGETING ME

04:14.793 --> 04:16.620
AND I END UP STAYING...

04:16.654 --> 04:19.550
>> I'M REALLY SORRY.

04:19.586 --> 04:23.757
>> ...THEN I'LL BE COMING FOR
HIS NECK, I DON'T CARE.

04:23.793 --> 04:24.757
>> HUSBAND, ARE YOU SAD?

04:24.793 --> 04:26.862
>> DUDE, WHAT THE HELL IS
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

04:26.896 --> 04:29.826
I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING TO SEE
WHITNEY'S FACE UP THERE, BUT I

04:29.862 --> 04:31.862
WAS NOT READY TO SEE HANNAH AT
ALL.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.896
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE WAS AN
OPTION.

04:34.930 --> 04:38.067
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A TEAMMATE
THIS WEEK BECAUSE THAT HURTS MY

04:38.103 --> 04:39.000
PERSONAL GAME.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.826
THIS, HONESTLY, IS THE
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

04:40.862 --> 04:45.067
>> SORRY BIG BROTHER.

04:45.103 --> 04:47.757
>> RIGHT NOW I'M IN A TOUGH
SPOT.

04:47.793 --> 04:50.067
A MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT IS
SITTING ON THE BLOCK, AND MY

04:50.103 --> 04:53.550
TEAM NEVER CAME TO A CLEAR
DECISION ON WHO OUR TARGET IS

04:53.586 --> 04:54.826
GOING TO BE FOR THIS WEEK.

04:54.862 --> 04:59.620
I JUST HOPE I CAN MAKE IT CLEAR
TO CHRISTIAN WHAT IT IS IN HIS

04:59.654 --> 05:03.620
BEST INTEREST TO MAKE THE TARGET
WHITNEY THIS WEEK AND WE CAN

05:03.654 --> 05:08.447
MOVE FORWARD WHILE KEEPING
HANNAH SAFE.

05:08.481 --> 05:10.137
>> I FEEL SO BAD.

05:10.172 --> 05:11.481
>> I FEEL BAD.

05:11.516 --> 05:15.274
>> I WAS HOPING THAT CHRISTIAN
AND THE ROYAL FLUSH WOULD WANT

05:15.310 --> 05:17.930
TO TARGET HANNAH THIS WEEK, BUT
WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

05:17.964 --> 05:19.343
COME TO A DECISION YET.

05:19.379 --> 05:22.826
SO I HOPE NOW THAT NOMINATIONS
ARE LOCKED, WE CAN ALL JUST COME

05:22.862 --> 05:25.033
TOGETHER AND DECIDE ON WHO THE
TARGET SHOULD BE AND ULTIMATELY

05:25.067 --> 05:26.447
WHO IS BEST TO GO HOME.

05:26.481 --> 05:31.103
>> IT'S BETWEEN THE TWO.

05:31.137 --> 05:33.067
IT'S SUCH A TOSS-UP.

05:33.103 --> 05:34.620
EITHER OF THEM I WOULD BE SO
HAPPY THEY WENT HOME.

05:34.654 --> 05:38.654
>> I PERSONALLY THINK FOR MY
GAME, HANNAH IS A WAY BETTER

05:38.689 --> 05:44.862
TARGET, SO I'M GOING TO FIGHT
FOR IT.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.930
>> OH, GOSH, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

05:46.965 --> 05:49.033
ARE WE GOING BACK AND FORTH
AGAIN?

05:49.067 --> 05:52.620
I'M JUST SAYING, IF WHITNEY IS
GOING TO BE HERE, SHE IS GOING

05:52.654 --> 05:53.862
TO BE PISSED.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.206
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU
HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT'S

05:56.240 --> 05:59.689
BEST FOR YOUR GAME.

05:59.723 --> 06:02.896
>> AND I GUESS THE BEST WAY TO
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS BETWEEN

06:02.930 --> 06:07.137
THE TWO OF THEM, WHITNEY GOING
IS BEST FOR MY GAME.

06:07.172 --> 06:11.586
>> ULTIMATELY, I DECIDED WHITNEY
NEEDS TO BE THE TARGET BECAUSE

06:11.620 --> 06:14.862
HANNAH MADE A VERY CONVINCING
ARGUMENT THAT IN THE EVENT SHE

06:14.896 --> 06:20.206
WAS A PAWN THAT MOVING FORWARD,
SHE WOULD NOT PUT ME UP IN THE

06:20.240 --> 06:21.310
FUTURE WEEKS.

06:21.343 --> 06:23.550
SO THAT SOUND LIKE AN ABSOLUTELY
PERFECT PAWN FOR ME.

06:23.586 --> 06:25.206
>> OH, THAN THAT WORKS.

06:25.240 --> 06:25.896
>> YEAH.

06:25.930 --> 06:29.654
>> WE'LL DO HANNAH NEXT WEEK.

06:29.689 --> 06:33.206
>> "X" IS SUPER HAPPY CHRISTIAN
CHANGED HIS MIND.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.654
LET'S KEEP IT THIS WAY.

06:35.689 --> 06:36.896
NO MORE CHANGING OUR MINDS.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.310
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING "X"
BECAUSE YOU'RE DESPERATE TO KEEP

06:38.343 --> 06:39.550
HANNAH.

06:39.586 --> 06:42.826
I AM 100% UPSET WITH THIS
DECISION BUT I'M SMART ENOUGH TO

06:42.862 --> 06:46.930
KNOW IF I KEEP PUSHING IT I
COULD PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK

06:46.965 --> 06:48.586
AND MAKING EVERYONE
UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:48.620 --> 06:53.310
>> LOVE IT.

06:53.343 --> 07:01.310
>> SO I'M ON THE BLOCK,
BADA-BING, BADA-BOOM, WHATEVER.

07:01.343 --> 07:02.586
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT
IT NOW.

07:02.620 --> 07:03.310
>> YOU ARE ALREADY GOOD.

07:03.343 --> 07:04.240
>> OKAY.

07:04.274 --> 07:06.274
>> YOU ARE THE PAWN, AND SHE'S
THE TARGET.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.240
>> OKAY.

07:07.274 --> 07:10.723
>> IF WE WERE TO VOTE TODAY, YOU
WOULD STAY.

07:10.757 --> 07:16.654
FOR YOU, THE BEST THING IS TO
YOU LAY LOW.

07:16.689 --> 07:19.550
>> I'M TRUSTING YOU ON THAT.

07:19.586 --> 07:20.000
>> OF COURSE.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.930
>> OKAY.

07:21.964 --> 07:24.654
CHRISTIAN TELLS ME THAT I AM
JUST THE PAWN THIS WEEK.

07:24.689 --> 07:31.137
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS
FOR ME BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NEVER

07:31.172 --> 07:33.343
FEEL TOO COMFORTABLE OR SAFE IN
THIS HOUSE.

07:33.379 --> 07:34.586
YEAH.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.067
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE TEA, AND
I'M GOING TO HEAD DOWNSTAIRS,

07:37.103 --> 07:40.586
AND I'M ANYTHING TO MOPE JUST A
BIT.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.965
I STILL NEED TO COMPETE MY HEART
OUT FOR THIS VETO, BECAUSE THE

07:45.000 --> 07:48.757
ONLY WAY THAT I KNOW I AM
STAYING IN THIS HOUSE FOR SURE

07:48.793 --> 07:51.826
IS IF I'M ABLE TO TAKE MYSELF
OFF THE BLOCK.

07:51.862 --> 07:52.481
>> I UNDERSTAND.

07:52.516 --> 07:56.654
>> YUP.

07:56.689 --> 07:57.137
GOING HOME.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.550
>> NOT THIS WEEK.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.586
>> KNOCK ON ALL THE WOOD.

08:00.620 --> 08:04.586
>> EXACTLY.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.310
>> HEY.

08:05.343 --> 08:06.137
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK?

08:06.172 --> 08:10.310
>> SURE.

08:10.343 --> 08:14.620
>> SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10,
WHERE ARE YOU AT ON THE PISSED

08:14.654 --> 08:15.310
OFF LEVEL?

08:15.343 --> 08:15.896
>> LIKE A 10?

08:15.930 --> 08:17.964
>> 10.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.654
COOL, WHITNEY.

08:19.689 --> 08:24.274
WE'VE BECOME FRIENDS THROUGHOUT
THIS GAME, AND EVEN THOUGH MY

08:24.310 --> 08:25.586
PRIMARY LOYALTIES ARE THE
COOKOUT AND THE KINGS TEAM, IT'S

08:25.620 --> 08:29.033
NOT GOING TO STOP ME FROM
CHECKING IN ON A FRIEND TO MAKE

08:29.067 --> 08:30.757
SURE THEY'RE OKAY WHEN THINGS
GET A LITTLE TOUGH.

08:30.793 --> 08:36.274
>> TO SEE MY FACE OUT OF
EVERYBODY'S, I WAS LIKE...

08:36.309 --> 08:37.379
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT?

08:37.413 --> 08:38.965
>> AND YOU HAVE BEEN MY FAVORITE
PERSON IN THE HOUSE.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.654
>> OKAY.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.688
>> OH, MY GOSH.

08:44.724 --> 08:50.517
>> SO CAN I ASK YOU AT ANY
POINT, DID YOU BRING UP ANY OF

08:50.551 --> 08:54.620
OUR NAMES, SAYING THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO PUT US UP, WHICH WE'VE

08:54.654 --> 08:55.344
ALL BEEN TOLD.

08:55.379 --> 08:57.102
>> THAT I WOULD PUT YOU GUYS UP.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.102
>> ALL OF OUR NAMES WERE BROUGHT
UP.

08:59.136 --> 09:00.309
>> OUT OF MY MOUTH.

09:00.344 --> 09:01.793
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TOLD YOU
HAVE BEEN SAYING ABOUT US.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.758
>> BUT I NEVER SAID THAT.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.344
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.826
IF YOU WERE TO WIN, WHO WOULD
YOU PUT UP?

09:08.861 --> 09:12.517
NO MATTER WHAT, ONE MEMBER OF
THE KINGS HAS TO GO HOME.

09:12.551 --> 09:16.136
>> AND THAT'S WHY IT KIND OF IS
WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.

09:16.172 --> 09:19.895
>> WELL, THAT NEVER HAPPENED,
SO...

09:19.931 --> 09:22.000
YOU LITERALLY HAVE BEEN MY
FAVORITE PERSON IN THE HOUSE.

09:22.033 --> 09:26.517
YOUR NAME NEVER CAME OUT OF MY
MOUTH.

09:26.551 --> 09:28.724
I FEEL COMPLETELY SHOCKED.

09:28.758 --> 09:31.724
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE HOUSE
WANTED TO TARGET THE KINGS.

09:31.758 --> 09:36.206
SO I REALLY JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M THE SCAPEGOAT.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.620
"X" IS THE PERSON THAT I'VE FELT
THE CLOSEST WITH.

09:38.654 --> 09:41.274
I DEFINITELY NEVER WOULD HAVE
PUT "X" ON THE BLOCK.

09:41.309 --> 09:44.688
BUT THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE
NOW.

09:44.724 --> 09:48.586
THIS WHOLE TIME I HAVE BEEN
LIKE-- JUST FEEL STUPID.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.826
>> HE CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU MORE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

09:50.861 --> 09:52.067
>> OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO.

09:52.102 --> 09:53.102
>> YOU'RE GOING TO GO?

09:53.136 --> 10:02.620
>> UH-HUH.

10:02.654 --> 10:03.517
>> HELLO.

10:03.551 --> 10:05.826
>> I'M SURE YOU HAVE A MILLION
QUESTIONS.

10:05.861 --> 10:10.586

SHOT OF BEING TAKEN OFF THE

HANNAH OFF THE BLOCK.

USE IT.

WAS USED THIS WEEK, BUT IF
EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO

THERE MIGHT STILL BE A WAY THAT
I CAN GET MYSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

35:14.619 --> 35:18.516
>> I BET YOU GUYS WILL BE ABLE
TO GO BACK ON SLOP NEXT WEEK.

35:26.585 --> 35:29.413
DO IT.

>> HEY, WHAT IF I'M STILL HERE!

35:37.550 --> 35:42.240
>> I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT ABOUT
A TEAMMATE.

35:42.275 --> 35:45.931
LIKE, THE FACT THAT HE KNOWS I'M
GOING TO GO HOME MAKES ME THINK

35:45.965 --> 35:49.757
THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME OTHER
THINGS GOING ON THAT I DON'T

35:49.793 --> 35:50.275
KNOW ABOUT.

35:50.309 --> 35:52.034

>> OH!

35:57.585 --> 35:59.068
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!

35:59.103 --> 36:02.378
I HOPE WHITNEY AND I CAN SMOOTH
THINGS OVER AND THAT WE CAN BE

36:02.413 --> 36:04.034
FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF THE
WEEK.

36:04.068 --> 36:09.034
BUT, HONESTLY, IF I WAS HER, I
WOULDN'T FORGIVE MYSELF.

36:09.068 --> 36:10.137
WHITT, I AM SO SORRY.

36:10.172 --> 36:12.757
>> THAT WAS--
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

36:12.793 --> 36:15.275
LITERALLY, ANY MEAL YOU WANT--
>> DEREK WAS TALKING ABOUT SLOP,

36:15.309 --> 36:20.827
AND HE SAID, "IT WILL JUST BE
HANNAH AND I ON SLOP NEXT WEEK.

36:20.862 --> 36:24.275
I'M ACTUALLY LIKE-- I'M NOT EVEN
JOKING.

36:24.309 --> 36:24.965
I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY UPSET.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.172
>> THAT'S SAD.

36:26.206 --> 36:28.585
>> THAT MEANS STRAIGHT UP YOU
ALREADY KNOW I'M GOING HOME.

36:28.619 --> 36:29.793
>> I'M SORRY.

36:29.827 --> 36:32.275
>> THAT WAS A DICK MOVE.

36:32.309 --> 36:35.827
>> I GUESS WHITNEY ISN'T LETTING
GO OF THIS.

36:35.862 --> 36:37.172
WAIT TO GO, DEREK.

36:37.206 --> 36:40.688
THAT ONE SENTENCE COULD HAVE
COST YOU $750,000.

36:40.724 --> 36:46.068
I'M WORRIED WHITNEY COULD REALLY
BLOW UP MY GAME, SO I NEED TO

36:46.103 --> 36:47.309
THINK BEFORE I SPEAK.

36:47.344 --> 36:47.896
>> DON'T STRESS.

36:47.931 --> 36:49.862
>> THAT WAS SO DUMB.

36:49.896 --> 36:51.688
I JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING AT ALL.

36:51.724 --> 36:56.550
>> OH, I AM READY TO PAINT A BIG
OLD TARGET ON DEREK X.'S BACK.

36:56.585 --> 37:00.516
THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

37:00.550 --> 37:01.827
MYSELF OUT OF THIS SITUATION
THAT I'M IN RIGHT NOW.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.793
HONESTLY, I WANT HIM OUT OF THE
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

37:03.827 --> 37:05.585
I'M A VENGEFUL BITCH.

37:05.619 --> 37:08.034
>> HONESTLY, IT MAKES THE MOST
SENSE FOR THAT PERSON TO BE UP

37:08.068 --> 37:10.724
ON THE BLOCK, BUT I WASN'T GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE HE'S MY

37:10.757 --> 37:11.413
TEAMMATE.

37:11.447 --> 37:13.344
BUT AFTER TODAY, TAKE HIM OUT.

37:23.585 --> 37:27.275
>> WELL, IT IS OFFICIAL THAT THE
H.O.H. AND THE VETO WINNER IS

37:27.309 --> 37:28.655
THE SAME EXACT PERSON.

37:28.688 --> 37:32.827
SO I ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON TO
TALK TO ABOUT IT.

37:32.862 --> 37:33.655
>> ... THE SAME ROOM.

37:33.688 --> 37:36.585
>> YEAH, THIS IS SUPER
BENEFICIAL.

37:36.619 --> 37:40.034
IF I WANT TO STAY THIS WEEK, I
NEED TO LET CHRISTIAN KNOW

37:40.068 --> 37:41.172
EXACTLY WHY I'M VALUABLE AND WHO
HE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING AFTER,

37:41.206 --> 37:42.240
WHICH IS DEREK X.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.862
BASICALLY, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION.

37:44.896 --> 37:50.585
I JUST-- LIKE, I DO BELIEVE THAT
THERE COULD BE ANOTHER OPTION TO

37:50.619 --> 37:51.068
PUT UP.

37:51.103 --> 37:51.550
>> UH-HUH.

37:51.585 --> 37:55.172
>> LIKE, DEREK X.

37:55.206 --> 37:59.378
WHO HAS WON A TON OF COMPS, AND
HE IS YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITION.

37:59.413 --> 38:01.757
>> MY BIGGEST COMPETITION, YEAH.

38:01.793 --> 38:06.550
YEAH, I MEAN, I'M DEFINITELY
AWARE OF HIS RESUME.

38:06.585 --> 38:11.619
AND I'M CONCERNED THAT HE MAY
TAKE THAT SHOT IF HE HAD THE

38:11.655 --> 38:12.896
CHANCE TO, FOR SURE.

38:12.931 --> 38:16.655
>> BUT IF YOU DID DECIDE TO PUT
HIM UP INSTEAD OF ME, LIKE, I

38:16.688 --> 38:19.655
REALLY WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH
YOU GUYS.

38:19.688 --> 38:25.068
HONESTLY, LIKE, I REALLY DO
BELIEVE IN THE RAW OF

38:25.103 --> 38:28.172
RECIPROCATION, SO IF YOU DID
SAVE ME, I HOPE YOU KNOW I WOULD

38:28.206 --> 38:30.068
DO EVERYTHING I COULD DO HELP
YOU IN RETURN.

38:30.103 --> 38:35.034
>> I BELIEVE IN THAT, TOO, SO--
>> IF YOU WERE OVER ON THE BLOCK

38:35.068 --> 38:38.000
AND I WERE TO WIN THE POWER OF
VETO, OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I

38:38.034 --> 38:38.896
PROMISE I WOULD HELP YOU.

38:38.931 --> 38:43.034
>> YEAH, I BELIEVE IT, I DO
BELIEVE IT.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.793
WHITNEY IS MAKING VERY GOOD
POINTS.

38:44.827 --> 38:46.378

BEAST.

38:46.413 --> 38:48.034
HE HAS TWO VETO WINS.

38:48.068 --> 38:51.034
AT THE SAME TIME, DEREK X. IS
PART OF THE ROYAL FLUSH, AND I'M

38:51.068 --> 38:55.481
NOT SO SURE I WANT TO TAKE A
SHOT AT MY ALLIANCE MEMBER YET.

38:55.516 --> 38:58.619
I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH IN MY
HEAD BECAUSE THE LAST THING I

38:58.655 --> 39:01.137
WANT TO DO IS MISS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUT MY

39:01.172 --> 39:03.103
BIGGEST COMPETITION IN THIS
GAME.

39:03.137 --> 39:04.724
I DEFINITELY NEED TO THINK ABOUT
IT MORE.

39:04.757 --> 39:05.516
>> I GET THAT.

39:05.550 --> 39:06.931
>> I DEFINITELY WILL CONSIDER
IT.

39:06.965 --> 39:17.000
I PROMISE.

39:17.000 --> 39:23.103
I PROMISE.

39:29.516 --> 39:42.585
>> HEY, HOUSEGUESTS, IT'S TIME
FOR THE VETO MEETING.

39:42.619 --> 39:46.172
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

39:46.206 --> 39:48.206
HANNAH AND WHITNEY HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

39:48.240 --> 39:53.344
BUT I HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE
OF THE NOMINATIONS.

39:53.378 --> 39:57.724
I HAVE DECIDED...

39:57.757 --> 40:08.550
NOT TO USE THE POWER OF VETO.

40:08.585 --> 40:18.240
THIS VETO MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

40:18.275 --> 40:21.724
WHITNEY MADE A GOOD PITCH TO
BACKDOOR DEREK X., BUT I'M NOT

40:21.757 --> 40:24.447
READY TO TURN ON MY ALLIANCE
YET.

40:24.481 --> 40:25.619
SORRY, WHITNEY.

40:25.655 --> 40:29.550
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET ROYALLY
FLUSHED

40:29.585 --> 40:31.619
[ TOILET FLUSHING ]
>> EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIAN IS

40:31.655 --> 40:34.137
TELLING ME THAT I'M JUST THE
PAWN THIS WEEK, I DO KNOW THAT

40:34.172 --> 40:38.516
AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS MY NAME
IN THEIR MOUTH, SO I CAN'T FEEL

40:38.550 --> 40:39.827
TOTALLY SAFE.

40:39.862 --> 40:41.724
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I STAY
PAST THIS THURSDAY NIGHT BECAUSE

40:41.757 --> 40:47.034
I STILL HAVE A LOT OF DAMAGE
LEFT TO INFLICT ON THIS GAME.

40:47.068 --> 40:49.965
SO JUST YOU WAIT.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.172
>> CHRISTIAN'S HONESTLY JUST
BEING REALLY DUMB AT THIS POINT.

40:53.206 --> 40:56.034
UNLESS THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER
AND I DON'T REALIZE IT,

40:56.068 --> 40:59.862
CHRISTIAN IS LOSING A GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT DEREK X.

40:59.896 --> 41:02.103
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME
GIVING UP.

41:02.137 --> 41:04.000
I AM A FIGHTER.

41:04.034 --> 41:06.724
AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN TO GET MYSELF OUT OF

41:06.757 --> 41:07.931
THIS POSITION.

41:07.965 --> 41:12.137
WHEN I SURVIVE EVICTION ON
THURSDAY, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN

41:12.172 --> 41:12.896
ALL-NEW WHITNEY.

41:12.931 --> 41:15.413
NO MORE MISS NICE GIRL.

41:15.447 --> 41:19.757
>> I'M NOT HAPPY TO SEE A MEMBER
OF THE COOKOUT, HANNAH, ON THE

41:19.793 --> 41:21.000
BLOCK.

41:21.034 --> 41:25.447
BUT I AM HAPPY TO SEE WHITNEY
STILL ON THE BLOCK BECAUSE I'M

41:25.481 --> 41:26.034
PETTY.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.275
I WANT XAVIER TO MYSELF.

41:27.309 --> 41:28.550
I'M HUMAN.

41:28.585 --> 41:32.034
>> I LOST THE BATTLE OVER WHO
SHOULD BE THE TARGET THIS WEEK,

41:32.068 --> 41:34.068
BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET.

41:34.103 --> 41:38.965
THE WAR OF WHO IS ACTUALLY BEING
EVICTED HAS JUST STARTED.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.827
SO, HANNAH, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO FEELS LIKE AN ACTIVE THREAT

41:41.862 --> 41:43.585
TO MY GAME RIGHT NOW.

41:43.619 --> 41:45.655
SO, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE NOT
SAFE AS LONG AS I'M HERE.

41:45.688 --> 41:46.862
HERE.

EVICTEDLY FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"
