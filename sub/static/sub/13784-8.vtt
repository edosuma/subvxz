01:35.087 --> 01:37.965
What did you know about me, Bullock?
First we met? 

01:38.047 --> 01:41.562
- No concern for my feelings, huh?
- That you were a killer.

01:42.247 --> 01:46.479
Certain facts show in the mug.
Look at her.

01:49.647 --> 01:52.639
- You know she's fucked for food.
- What's the point?

01:52.767 --> 01:54.997
In your mug, there is no such history.

01:55.087 --> 01:59.558
Are you a cunt-driven, near-maniac
or a stalwart driven by principle?

01:59.767 --> 02:02.918
The many cannot tell, for you yourself
are so fucking confused.

02:03.007 --> 02:04.759
But you do make a good appearance...

02:04.847 --> 02:06.405
so they're prone to grant
you their trust...

02:06.487 --> 02:09.080
which we will use as an asset
in the coming campaign.

02:09.167 --> 02:10.360
What's the campaign?

02:10.447 --> 02:14.281
You have friends in Montana in high
positions, some type fucking judge?

02:14.567 --> 02:18.355
- I've cut ties with the judge in Montana.
- Amiably or owing money?

02:18.447 --> 02:20.358
Maybe you're mistrusted less
as a killer...

02:20.447 --> 02:22.915
than showing your cards
a corner at a time.

02:23.047 --> 02:25.436
Our cause is surviving.

02:25.807 --> 02:29.163
Not being allied with Yankton or cogs
in the Hearst machine...

02:29.807 --> 02:32.640
to show it don't fate us as runts, or...

02:32.807 --> 02:34.206
two-headed calves or...

02:34.287 --> 02:37.404
pigs with excess legs,
to a good fucking grinding up.

02:37.487 --> 02:39.125
I only mention the judge in Montana...

02:39.207 --> 02:41.801
toward maybe drumming up interest
in us there.

02:41.927 --> 02:44.316
Annexation to Montana
instead of Dakota?

02:44.487 --> 02:47.957
Hiking our skirts to Helena
might put Yankton back on its heels.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.523
And as minutes turn to hours
over the piss-pot, I wonder, should we...

02:51.607 --> 02:55.441
ruminate publicly in loud voices
over forming a new territory...

02:55.527 --> 02:58.758
with an eye towards future statehood,
or even our own republic?

02:58.847 --> 02:59.882
No dictatorship?

02:59.967 --> 03:02.162
What the fuck do we need
a dictatorship for...

03:02.247 --> 03:05.523
that silences the public voice,
that eases the enemy's way?

03:05.607 --> 03:07.962
Noise made, overtures to
outside interests and...

03:08.047 --> 03:11.676
enlistment of the hooples' participation
is what this situation demands.

03:11.767 --> 03:14.964
And a trustworthy mug
with a vague motive...

03:15.207 --> 03:17.402
out there, bugling the call.

03:17.887 --> 03:19.320
I'm not interested.

03:21.927 --> 03:26.125
Our moment permits interest in
one question only.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.438
Will we, of Deadwood...

03:28.887 --> 03:31.720
be more than target for ass-fucking?

03:31.887 --> 03:35.197
To not grab ankle is to declare
yourself interested.

03:37.087 --> 03:39.282
What's your posture, Bullock?

03:39.487 --> 03:41.443
As you see.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.676
Huzzah, then.

03:49.407 --> 03:52.080
"The operations of
the old Aurora and Keets mines, and...

03:52.167 --> 03:55.682
"a number of smaller adjoining claims,
are now entirely consolidated...

03:55.767 --> 03:58.725
"accessed through the former
hidden-treasure property.

03:59.087 --> 04:00.839
"Anxious as I know you to be,
Mr Hearst...

04:00.927 --> 04:03.157
"to move to 24-hour operation...

04:03.407 --> 04:06.797
"until workers at wage outnumber
individual prospectors in the camp...

04:06.887 --> 04:10.197
"the matter of Chinese labour remains
delicate of introduction.

04:10.287 --> 04:12.596
"And we must therefore rest content
with Germans...

04:12.687 --> 04:14.996
"and Cornish unwilling to work at night.

04:15.247 --> 04:17.202
"We shower them after every shift...

04:17.286 --> 04:19.517
"and the gold they've combed into
their hair with grease...

04:19.607 --> 04:23.282
"we recover from the traps installed
beneath the wash-house facility.

04:23.447 --> 04:25.165
"The Cornish are quicker than
the Germans but...

04:25.247 --> 04:27.317
"ever ready to combine and complain.

04:27.407 --> 04:29.238
"And deserve their reputation
as high-graders...

04:29.327 --> 04:31.477
"which, if anything, is understated. "

04:31.607 --> 04:33.757
"Through the vigilance of
our security fellows...

04:33.847 --> 04:35.519
"the unremitting larceny of
these cunning and...

04:35.607 --> 04:37.962
"clannish men is held
somewhat in check.

04:38.047 --> 04:41.119
"I cite in particular the effectiveness
of Captain Turner...

04:41.247 --> 04:44.683
- "invaluable to us since the Comstock. "
- Watch it!

04:45.847 --> 04:48.998
"With purchase of the claim formerly
operated by the Manuel brothers...

04:49.087 --> 04:52.284
"we will control, save one,
the Garret property...

04:52.407 --> 04:54.875
"every considerable deposit
now discovered. "

04:55.327 --> 04:57.636
"I am told your arrival is imminent,
Mr Hearst.

04:57.727 --> 05:01.117
"I look forward to showing you every
aspect of what I believe soon may be...

05:01.207 --> 05:03.277
"truthfully described as the largest...

05:03.367 --> 05:06.325
"and most forward-looking
gold operation in the world.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.399
"Francis Wolcott. "

05:09.687 --> 05:12.645
No one is with child.
Tessie may have clap.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.796
We'll take her off the firing line, then.

05:16.207 --> 05:19.404
With whatever intervening supervision...

05:19.607 --> 05:21.518
I take it these new-arrived
Chinese whores...

05:21.607 --> 05:25.156
- to be under your control?
- Well-evaluated, Doc.

05:25.687 --> 05:28.884
I'd be available to see to their care,
like I do these here.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.883
Declined, with thanks.

05:32.047 --> 05:35.403
You may not be aware
that beyond their afflictions...

05:35.487 --> 05:38.081
these girls are fucking starving to death.

05:38.167 --> 05:42.524
I ain't one, Doc, holds the white man's
as the sole and only path.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.919
I strive to tolerate what
I may not agree with...

05:47.047 --> 05:51.359
but those people's culture,
their women are disposable.

05:51.447 --> 05:55.486
They ship them unfed,
replace them when they expire.

05:56.927 --> 06:00.761
They dose them with opium, I know,
which I gather eases their pangs.

06:01.727 --> 06:04.195
Well, under this arrangement...

06:04.367 --> 06:06.517
I withdraw my care for your whites.

06:06.607 --> 06:10.202
- For Christ's sake, Doc!
- No, I need to live, too!

06:10.327 --> 06:14.957
Raise your rates on these, then. Don't
disrupt the other fucking equilibrium.

06:15.087 --> 06:18.523
I would see to those others pro bono.

06:19.007 --> 06:22.283
I know what that means.
Prove to me you do.

06:22.567 --> 06:26.640
- It won't cost you anything.
- Well, Jesus Christ.

06:29.047 --> 06:32.642
Here, too, let me tolerate
a different point of view.

06:48.007 --> 06:51.920
- Studying on a getaway, Tom?
- Ain't she a beauty, Al?

06:52.567 --> 06:54.762
In the French, it's called a velocipede...

06:54.847 --> 06:57.156
meaning "go swiftly into the world. "

06:57.247 --> 06:59.283
This is the gent's Boneshaker model...

06:59.367 --> 07:01.835
and the French can stay
the fuck out of it.

07:02.527 --> 07:04.677
How's that for a contraption, boss?

07:05.767 --> 07:07.997
Someone from Farnum, that...

07:08.167 --> 07:10.681
cunt with the long kraut moniker.

07:11.127 --> 07:12.685
E. B. ain't been over for coffee.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.803
Should I ask if Farnum's
come for coffee...

07:14.887 --> 07:17.162
before I get you to summon that cunt?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.318
Dead and without a body...

07:23.407 --> 07:25.796
you still outstrip him for intelligence.

07:26.687 --> 07:28.996
Would you please know
Mr A. W. Merrick?

07:29.207 --> 07:31.596
- I'm A. W. Merrick.
- Good.

07:35.847 --> 07:38.361
I'm Blasanov...

07:38.607 --> 07:41.246
agent for Cheyenne and
Black Hills Telegraph Company.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.716
- Welcome, Mr Blasanov.
- Thank you.

07:43.807 --> 07:46.640
Can you show me immediately to
my apparatus?

07:46.727 --> 07:49.400
Our long-anticipated telegraph operator.

07:49.967 --> 07:54.358
Your company, having leased space for
you in my office, your apparatus, sir...

07:54.447 --> 07:58.360
is next to mine, and I will show it to you
with pleasure. This way.

08:01.807 --> 08:06.039
Has my apparatus been... Thank you.
Been guarded from interference?

08:06.327 --> 08:10.366
In candour, Mr Blasanov, some nights
more successfully than others.

08:10.487 --> 08:12.842
There's a fucking pair to draw to.

08:13.327 --> 08:18.082
I hope the electrical fluid is not
blistered with fierce voltage, someone...

08:18.207 --> 08:22.405
- foolish to ground its potential.
- I'm not aware of any blistering...

08:22.487 --> 08:25.559
and my hopes in that regard
may be different from yours.

08:25.647 --> 08:27.683
Did you see my bicycle, young man?

08:28.567 --> 08:30.603
They call that type bone-shaking, sir.

08:30.687 --> 08:32.722
They do, for a mortal truth.

08:36.366 --> 08:40.883
Look at it this way, then.
Mightn't the Lord give second chances?

08:41.687 --> 08:44.838
Not on merit, necessarily.
I ain't claiming that.

08:45.807 --> 08:49.436
Say he does it on whim, on any basis.

08:49.527 --> 08:50.880
And here she comes...

08:51.167 --> 08:54.716
with that little one beside her
and another she fixes to produce.

08:55.807 --> 08:57.877
And keenness to
my shortcomings don't...

08:57.967 --> 09:01.482
blind me to seeing a-right,
that when a boulder needs hauling...

09:01.567 --> 09:05.116
I will haul a boulder,
which is asset to a woman...

09:05.207 --> 09:09.246
with a child in her care
and another she readies to deliver.

09:10.207 --> 09:13.597
Now, what harm is there in believing...

09:14.127 --> 09:18.006
that not taking a chance might be
a confounding of His will?

09:20.527 --> 09:23.917
I'm taking that silence for
fucking support.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.999
- Mrs Bullock.
- Thank you so much for seeing us.

09:30.087 --> 09:33.238
- Good morning, William.
- Good morning, Mrs Garret.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.199
Please, come in.

09:35.887 --> 09:37.764
It smells awful nice in here.

09:37.887 --> 09:41.004
We had berry tea
before Sofia's lesson.

09:42.647 --> 09:44.080
Will you have some?

09:44.247 --> 09:48.240
- Please, if it's not a trouble.
- I don't want any, thank you.

09:48.527 --> 09:50.757
I didn't know the smell was from tea.

09:52.647 --> 09:56.322
Will you show William your corner
in our other room, Sofia?

09:56.727 --> 09:59.036
Not your toys.
Show him only your books.

09:59.927 --> 10:01.201
Thank you.

10:03.207 --> 10:06.165
And thank you for the candy
when I first got to camp.

10:12.887 --> 10:15.606
Please, forgive the suddenness
of my coming.

10:15.927 --> 10:17.599
Not at all, Mrs Bullock.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.445
I feel an urgency about the matter
which brings me.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.523
Please tell me what it is.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.158
You know that Miss Stokes...

10:32.247 --> 10:33.965
the teacher for whom
we'd waited so long-

10:34.047 --> 10:35.366
Has fled.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.725
Yes.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.718
A great disappointment to me,
as I'm sure it was to you.

10:43.087 --> 10:44.406
I hope I'm...

10:44.807 --> 10:47.002
adequate to guiding my son's studies.

10:47.087 --> 10:49.203
I believe I am...

10:49.527 --> 10:53.202
but a child in solitude cannot find
his gift for society.

10:55.047 --> 10:56.799
What do you propose?

10:57.127 --> 10:59.516
That I teach the camp's children.

11:16.527 --> 11:20.042
The water is usually brought from
the kitchen, already at a boil.

11:20.287 --> 11:23.165
- Please don't bother with the tea.
- It's no bother.

11:23.287 --> 11:26.677
It would hardly be a bother,
if I were only properly prepared.

11:30.367 --> 11:34.440
On a second opportunity, with adequate
notification, we will meet you in order...

11:34.527 --> 11:35.721
and readiness.

11:36.167 --> 11:39.523
I seem always to come upon you
with inadequate notice.

11:41.247 --> 11:44.239
As you remarked,
simple courtesy would forestall that.

11:45.207 --> 11:47.118
I'm trying to imagine
what courtesy of mine...

11:47.207 --> 11:50.517
would have forestalled
the last awkwardness between us.

11:55.927 --> 11:59.636
Do you wish, then, to take Sofia
under your care as well?

12:00.687 --> 12:02.917
As well as whom, Mrs Garret?

12:03.007 --> 12:05.362
Why, Mrs Bullock, as well as your son.

12:06.807 --> 12:08.718
Whom else would I mean?

12:11.247 --> 12:12.396
Good morning.

12:12.487 --> 12:16.446
Good morning, Mr Swearengen.
Excuse me. Change of light.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.927
Pupils slow adjusting,
hope that don't owe to morphine.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.838
- No.
- Anyhow, thanks for...

12:21.927 --> 12:23.645
brushing against my prick.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.680
May I sit down?

12:28.887 --> 12:30.081
Too early for you?

12:30.167 --> 12:32.078
- I don't time my drinking.
- Dan!

12:35.687 --> 12:38.645
$50,000. Now, to me.

12:38.727 --> 12:41.366
Mr Dority signs for the murder of
Brom Garret...

12:41.447 --> 12:44.359
on my orders, as commissioned by
his faithless wife.

12:44.727 --> 12:46.843
Second document, signed by you.

12:46.927 --> 12:51.205
Detailing during transport to New York
for trial, along with faithless wife...

12:51.567 --> 12:53.205
Dority escapes custody.

12:53.327 --> 12:55.887
$50,000, now to me. $10,000...

12:55.967 --> 12:58.800
now you to Dority.
$10,000, now you to Adams.

12:59.047 --> 13:02.881
Agreed, with these amendments.
$25,000 to you on signatures...

13:03.207 --> 13:05.675
on Dority's safe return
following his escape...

13:06.527 --> 13:08.006
and by your giving over the document...

13:08.087 --> 13:11.079
signed by me to an agent
designated by Pinkerton...

13:11.687 --> 13:14.076
or burning it in the agent's presence...

13:14.487 --> 13:16.318
the second $25,000.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.527
- Agreed.
- Will you draft Dority's confession?

13:19.687 --> 13:21.757
I'll draft both fucking documents.

13:23.807 --> 13:25.286
Now, would you find your own way out...

13:25.367 --> 13:27.881
while I explain myself to the guilty party?

13:29.207 --> 13:31.437
You want to brush agin my prick?

13:36.487 --> 13:38.079
Got a good fucking head
on her shoulders...

13:38.167 --> 13:40.601
unlike some other parties in this room.

13:44.007 --> 13:46.362
That's some kind of contraption
you got there.

13:46.447 --> 13:49.120
Do you suppose had the inventor
moved among us...

13:49.207 --> 13:52.324
he'd have made a model more
suited to sinkholes?

13:52.527 --> 13:56.281
Guided and pedalled a-right, she'll
roll smooth as a ball on a green.

13:56.887 --> 13:59.685
Yours ain't the fucking hands
or the fucking feet.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.481
So, this is the famous place of death.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.962
At that very table, Mr Blasanov...

14:07.047 --> 14:10.642
- Wild Bill Hickok was shot.
- I've read the account...

14:10.767 --> 14:12.519
perhaps from your hand?

14:12.607 --> 14:14.120
My bicycle...

14:14.327 --> 14:17.763
masters Boardwalk and Quagmire
with aplomb.

14:18.407 --> 14:22.002
Those that doubt me
suck cock by choice.

14:22.607 --> 14:25.599
Does that signal a willingness
to wager?

14:25.687 --> 14:30.044
You're goddamn right,
in specie or fucking currency.

14:30.127 --> 14:33.836
Surely odds must differ between
Quagmire and Boardwalk.

14:33.927 --> 14:36.725
I don't speak of
the Quagmire lengthwise.

14:37.047 --> 14:40.119
Well, shall Quagmire be the Bella
Union gap of the main thoroughfare?

14:40.207 --> 14:41.322
Done.

14:41.407 --> 14:45.719
-8-to-1 odds on the Quagmire.
- I shall swoop across it.

14:45.807 --> 14:49.959
-8-to-1 taken to 100.
- Even money on the Boardwalk.

14:50.047 --> 14:53.960
Done! Taken to 100.
Loose boards to be nailed...

14:54.087 --> 14:57.238
commerce suspended,
animals, drunks and sundries...

14:57.327 --> 15:00.558
- cleared from my lane of passage.
- Done.

15:00.647 --> 15:02.956
May I have time to
ready my camera, Tom?

15:03.647 --> 15:05.239
- Get going.
- I'll make fresh plates...

15:05.327 --> 15:08.080
- and a new stop-bath.
- Whatever the fuck that means.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.965
- Come, Mr Blasanov.
- What has just happened?

15:11.127 --> 15:14.403
Those who doubt me
suck cock by choice.

15:22.247 --> 15:25.603
I had time only to make
cold meat sandwiches...

15:25.687 --> 15:27.803
after seeing Mrs Garret.

15:28.367 --> 15:31.916
- Fine.
- Ice-cold cider in the cellar.

15:33.647 --> 15:34.796
I'll get it.

15:37.527 --> 15:41.042
She thought it wonderful that
I should teach the camp's children.

15:41.367 --> 15:43.961
- Good.
- Wonderful.

15:48.607 --> 15:49.960
Poor woman.

15:52.127 --> 15:55.517
Husband killed, left alone.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.478
Any person would have found
her situation sympathetic...

16:00.767 --> 16:03.281
let alone someone of your instincts.

16:09.407 --> 16:12.604
- Mr Nuttall has received a bicycle.
- Has he?

16:13.287 --> 16:16.802
- William was very excited to see it.
- Good.

16:18.407 --> 16:19.999
Your food is ready.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.762
He's out back waiting. William is.

16:42.087 --> 16:45.716
- That's mighty good for business.
- Shut up!

16:48.207 --> 16:52.519
There's a girl sitting by herself
in that whorehouse...

16:52.687 --> 16:54.120
Joanie Stubbs.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.767
Next you see her,
give her my congratulations.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.922
Seeing you know about losing friends...

17:04.007 --> 17:06.601
you might be a good person to go on
and talk to her.

17:06.686 --> 17:09.440
How does standing in my own puke...

17:09.527 --> 17:13.076
prompt you to volunteer me to give
a condolence call?

17:13.207 --> 17:15.402
Why fucking wouldn't it, Jane?

17:16.327 --> 17:19.079
You like being situated how you are?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.964
What fucking friends
did she lose, anyway?

17:30.407 --> 17:32.477
How are Martha and William?

17:33.087 --> 17:34.566
Well.

17:46.967 --> 17:50.642
What would you think of Marcus' lot,
Seth, as location for the bank?

17:51.047 --> 17:52.878
I could see arguments in favour.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.798
He's going back to Bismarck.

17:54.887 --> 17:59.403
Asking $14,000, 10 of which he'd carry
at 1 % a month, which I find reasonable.

18:00.887 --> 18:03.401
Obviously, the location's its great virtue.

18:03.687 --> 18:06.440
Under all the circumstances, I disagree.

18:09.647 --> 18:12.161
- Too central?
- Not too central, no.

18:12.327 --> 18:15.080
I'm thinking more the chief backer
might find unpleasant...

18:15.167 --> 18:18.125
- this building being always in her view.
- I see.

18:18.407 --> 18:21.001
Anything further you need explained
chapter and verse?

18:21.087 --> 18:23.885
I hadn't understood the matter
continued so tender.

18:23.967 --> 18:26.322
It ain't tenderness, avoiding provocation.

18:26.407 --> 18:28.318
It's common fucking courtesy.

18:28.487 --> 18:31.001
Which neither of you is showing
fucking much toward me.

18:31.087 --> 18:32.122
It's over.

18:33.927 --> 18:35.565
It's finished!

18:40.847 --> 18:44.362
You've got the worst brother, Mose...

18:44.527 --> 18:47.917
as ugly as he is,
that miserable a disposition.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.161
Mr Manuel, how are you, sir?

18:52.527 --> 18:55.564
Fuck you, Tolliver,
your crooked games...

18:55.647 --> 18:59.720
- and your watered-down liquor.
- Francis Wolcott, Mr Manuel.

18:59.807 --> 19:03.004
- Thank you for coming.
- State your business.

19:03.327 --> 19:05.204
An admirable rigour in manner.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.885
Would you join me, please?

19:13.367 --> 19:18.157
Do I guess rightly, sir, that you and
your brother do not deal happily with...

19:18.247 --> 19:20.556
- groups of men?
- Nor each other.

19:20.647 --> 19:22.683
Yet you have made a rich find
and have done...

19:22.767 --> 19:26.555
- very well in beginning its development.
- State your business.

19:26.887 --> 19:30.721
Further development may require
organisation on a scale and...

19:31.127 --> 19:34.403
dealings with men to which you and
your brother are not suited...

19:34.487 --> 19:36.239
or not disposed to attempt.

19:36.487 --> 19:39.081
With thieving bastard Cornishmen,
you mean?

19:39.247 --> 19:42.603
Underground in the shafts,
high-graders every one of them.

19:42.767 --> 19:45.440
The interests I represent have learned
to deal effectively...

19:45.527 --> 19:48.564
over the years with high-grading
and other forms of theft by employees.

19:48.647 --> 19:52.879
You ain't learned no effective method
when it's my brother going against you.

19:53.047 --> 19:55.038
Against us in what sense?

19:55.967 --> 19:58.322
In all five fucking senses.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.886
More reason you and he might sever...

19:59.967 --> 20:02.037
connections toward taking
separate paths.

20:02.127 --> 20:04.163
I'm sitting here, ain't I?

20:04.807 --> 20:08.766
We would offer $200,000 for
an undivided ownership on your claim.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.679
We'd both have to fucking sell.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.485
I'd presume your brother
has stays and...

20:12.567 --> 20:14.717
encumbrances on your right
to separate sale?

20:14.807 --> 20:18.163
He's encumbered every fucking breath
I've ever fucking taken.

20:19.047 --> 20:20.366
$200,000?

20:20.967 --> 20:24.039
Would it expedite matters if I made
our case to your brother?

20:24.127 --> 20:27.642
I'll make the fucking case,
once I find the saloon he's in.

20:28.207 --> 20:30.846
He should understand that our patience
is not inexhaustible.

20:30.927 --> 20:32.838
- Did I say I thought that?
- No.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.487
- Don't tell me how to talk to my brother!
- Certainly not.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.478
Unless you're trying to
fucking irritate me!

20:37.567 --> 20:39.239
Opposite of my intention.

20:41.607 --> 20:44.963
- $200,000?
- Cash.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.606
- Mrs Garret.
- Why do you linger?

21:12.287 --> 21:15.882
The stages are frequent,
and you're past your stated purpose.

21:15.967 --> 21:19.164
- Have you another?
- Please, Mrs Garret, do come in.

21:25.447 --> 21:27.677
Do you believe I do?

21:28.087 --> 21:31.523
My beliefs about you have to do with
your soul...

21:32.447 --> 21:36.759
which I feel is cold and ungenerous,
unless you are a counterfeit.

21:37.847 --> 21:41.362
And if you are a counterfeit,
the deception comes so naturally...

21:41.447 --> 21:45.440
I'd credit its source in such a soul,
meaning cold and ungenerous...

21:45.527 --> 21:49.361
and as capable of counterfeit,
manipulative and treacherous as well.

21:50.087 --> 21:52.681
Who can you think I am, Mrs Garret?

21:53.407 --> 21:56.126
- I, a poor working girl?
- You are not.

21:56.487 --> 22:01.038
I only hope your high wroth, ma'am,
don't bespeak some affair gone amiss.

22:04.127 --> 22:07.119
I hope to Christ not involving Mr Bullock.

22:09.327 --> 22:13.206
Even under such duress,
you oughtn't presume to strike me.

22:13.567 --> 22:18.277
For who do you take me, then?
For who do you mistake me?

22:19.367 --> 22:23.883
I mistake you for no one, Miss
Isringhausen, and I know you for a fact.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.598
All right then, Mrs Garret.

22:28.287 --> 22:31.677
You've had your fit of temper.
Get the fuck back to your room.

23:03.407 --> 23:04.999
How's his toothache?

23:05.087 --> 23:07.601
I ain't requiring about
his toothache, Richardson.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.757
And you oughtn't be requiring about
his toothache, either.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.202
You ought to be hoping that his nibs
will be sleeping, so...

23:12.287 --> 23:14.847
we can both sneak away
and go watch the ride.

23:15.287 --> 23:16.800
What are you, what are you-

23:16.887 --> 23:21.085
- You stupid-
- Mr Farnum, are you in there?

23:21.167 --> 23:25.763
I need your permission, Mr Farnum.
I'm coming in.

23:28.447 --> 23:30.005
What's killing you?

23:35.607 --> 23:37.518
What's afflicting you?

23:39.807 --> 23:42.799
Stop it!
For God's sake, get away from me!

23:45.527 --> 23:50.043
I put clove-soaked cloth to my tooth.
I must have gagged on it...

23:51.287 --> 23:54.120
- when I was napping.
- Are you saved, sir?

23:54.567 --> 23:56.956
Your filthy hand was down my throat!

23:59.167 --> 24:01.522
May I go out to watch the bicycle?

24:02.327 --> 24:06.445
Watch the earth yielding up its dead,
so long as it's not near me!

24:07.127 --> 24:10.915
And never violate
my private office again!

24:13.607 --> 24:15.404
That cocksucker.

24:16.567 --> 24:20.765
What do you think of that, Chief?
Some kind of fucking division of...

24:21.087 --> 24:23.123
feeling? Yeah?

24:26.927 --> 24:29.236
If I'm overstepping, boss, I apologise.

24:29.687 --> 24:31.564
I'm waiting.

24:36.287 --> 24:37.766
Sometimes I hear you speaking
in here...

24:37.847 --> 24:40.566
when I know there's nobody
in here but you.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.365
You have not yet reached the age,
Dan, have you...

24:45.127 --> 24:48.961
where you're moved to
utterance of thoughts...

24:49.127 --> 24:52.085
- properly kept silent?
- Been known to mutter.

24:52.167 --> 24:56.160
Not the odd mutter.
Habitual fucking vocalising of...

24:56.247 --> 24:58.363
thoughts best kept to yourself.

24:59.487 --> 25:01.876
I will confide further.

25:03.167 --> 25:04.156
Lately...

25:06.087 --> 25:07.964
I talk to this package.

25:09.847 --> 25:11.758
The severed, rotting head...

25:11.847 --> 25:15.522
I paid bounty on last year
of that murdered fucking Indian.

25:19.887 --> 25:22.003
Well, anyways, it's the late shift.

25:23.567 --> 25:27.196
You subscribe one way or another to
Tom Nuttall's big ride?

25:27.447 --> 25:31.326
No. I don't see him making it,
but I didn't want to root agin him.

25:34.127 --> 25:36.163
The Indian got an opinion?

25:57.527 --> 26:00.644
Don't the decapitated
deserve recreation, Chief?

26:00.847 --> 26:04.317
As much, if not more so,
than those of us yet not dismembered.

26:10.927 --> 26:14.158
You, fucking Chief,
are uglier than before...

26:14.727 --> 26:17.195
when you were also
not a treat to the eyes.

26:20.767 --> 26:22.678
Suffer the low vantage.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.767
It's better for my standing in the camp.

26:26.327 --> 26:28.841
That is a lay-down you propose!

26:31.567 --> 26:35.355
Corruption won't never breathe stinky
on my bicycle!

26:35.967 --> 26:38.435
Sent many of your friends to
the happy hunting ground.

26:38.527 --> 26:42.236
Formidable, Tom was, and no more
a fool now than time shows us all.

26:42.567 --> 26:46.037
Using the smallest possible aperture,
Mr Blasanov...

26:46.927 --> 26:51.079
and the fastest shutter speed,
our endeavour is to capture...

26:51.487 --> 26:55.196
Mr Nuttall's attempt
in all its vigour and velocity.

26:56.687 --> 26:59.918
- We got to sell this claim, Charlie.
- Why?

27:00.767 --> 27:03.076
'Cause if we don't,
we're going to fuck it up.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.600
Speak for yourself.

27:14.007 --> 27:18.046
Speaking for myself, if we don't sell,
you're going to fuck it up.

27:18.487 --> 27:20.603
Speak for yourself.

27:29.047 --> 27:30.639
Come on, Tom.

27:42.727 --> 27:44.399
Go on, my son!

28:04.447 --> 28:06.722
He made it, Chief.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.797
My brother had an accident.

28:14.887 --> 28:18.323
- What's his condition now?
- Fatal. Dead.

28:18.407 --> 28:22.116
- Fatal gunshot.
- So, an accident.

28:22.687 --> 28:26.157
Handling his weapon.
A self-inflicted wound.

28:27.167 --> 28:31.126
Fucking stupid, showing off when
he's been fucking drinking.

28:32.367 --> 28:36.997
Or a stupid fucking trick,
more than one fucking time he'd do that.

28:38.127 --> 28:41.278
- For Christ's sake.
- Are there other kin, Mr Manuel?

28:41.447 --> 28:44.086
- There's just us.
- Mother and father dead, no siblings-

28:44.167 --> 28:47.443
- What did I just fucking say to you?
- Do you accept our offer...

28:47.527 --> 28:50.564
as your brother's sole heir and
agent of your own interests?

28:53.247 --> 28:54.566
$200,000.

28:54.727 --> 28:57.958
- Cash upon execution.
- We already executed.

29:06.767 --> 29:10.282
Jane Cannary! Jane Cannary coming in.

29:12.247 --> 29:14.761
- Hello!
- Closed.

29:16.327 --> 29:18.795
I ain't here for any funny business.

29:19.447 --> 29:21.085
My name's Jane Cannary.

29:21.407 --> 29:24.399
You and me got a pain-in-the-balls
mutual acquaintance...

29:24.527 --> 29:27.405
- Charlie fucking Utter.
- How do you do, Jane?

29:28.327 --> 29:29.726
Joanie Stubbs.

29:33.887 --> 29:36.526
Would you like a drink?

29:37.727 --> 29:41.276
Yes! But my opening position is no.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.397
I'm having a drink, Jane.

29:44.767 --> 29:47.327
I'll probably join you directly.

29:51.407 --> 29:54.399
Charlie says you lost your friends.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.116
Yes.

29:59.407 --> 30:02.877
- I don't guess it was plague.
- No.

30:05.327 --> 30:07.397
Fucking violence, probably.

30:14.287 --> 30:16.881
I worked a plague tent last year.

30:17.447 --> 30:20.678
People spoke of the good you did.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.239
Some left the tent upright.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.756
Maybe I will have a fucking drink...

30:27.047 --> 30:31.120
just for sociability's sake
and 'cause I'm a fucking drunk.

30:31.207 --> 30:33.084
Well, what's your preference?

30:34.287 --> 30:37.165
That it ain't been previously swallowed.

30:38.887 --> 30:40.445
Bourbon, if you got it.

30:41.847 --> 30:43.838
Bourbon from Kentucky.

30:43.927 --> 30:46.157
I should certainly fucking hope so.

30:48.607 --> 30:49.926
Thank you.

30:53.647 --> 30:57.037
Murdered? Your friends?

30:59.047 --> 31:01.277
It's best probably not to talk about it.

31:01.367 --> 31:03.437
If we held to that rule, we'd be...

31:04.407 --> 31:08.366
mute like monks
months at a fucking time.

31:11.207 --> 31:13.004
Three of them murdered.

31:14.767 --> 31:17.486
Others shooed from camp
so they wouldn't be.

31:20.127 --> 31:23.119
I heard of a beating
Charlie Utter dispensed to some...

31:23.207 --> 31:26.517
cocksucker yesterday.
I wonder if that's connected.

31:27.047 --> 31:28.685
I wouldn't be surprised.

31:31.607 --> 31:32.676
Yes.

31:35.847 --> 31:39.965
Does he pose a further danger to you,
the cocksucker?

31:40.287 --> 31:42.676
Is that what's got you sitting in the dark?

31:43.447 --> 31:45.278
Sitting count as waiting?

31:47.287 --> 31:51.963
I'll say that's an attitude fit for darkness.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.801
Not knowing what else to say...

31:56.967 --> 31:59.356
or pretending that it ain't familiar.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.799
Anyways, I'm fuck...

32:02.887 --> 32:05.196
I'm pleased to meet you,
pleased to meet you.

32:06.847 --> 32:09.122
- Pleased to meet you, Jane.
- All right.

32:10.607 --> 32:15.044
Thank you for coming by.
Don't you want your drink?

32:16.087 --> 32:17.918
I guess I'll leave it.

32:19.447 --> 32:22.598
Refined spirits will sometimes
convulse me.

32:34.767 --> 32:39.204
- Mr Ellsworth.
- I was hoping for a word.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.958
As many as you'd like.

32:47.407 --> 32:52.162
- Is your purpose clandestine?
- Private, as far as that goes.

32:54.407 --> 32:56.045
Sofia's taking her nap.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.078
Let me get you a better chair.

33:03.007 --> 33:06.841
Would it speak ill of me that
I'm comfortable here?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.846
The other morning, you was...

33:18.247 --> 33:19.646
indisposed.

33:20.047 --> 33:22.880
I regret having imposed
that on your attention.

33:23.687 --> 33:25.359
I had a wife.

33:26.047 --> 33:29.960
Took by typhus, and our baby girl.

33:30.327 --> 33:33.364
- I'm so sorry, Mr Ellsworth.
- Thank you.

33:34.087 --> 33:37.557
Anyways, I'm acquainted with certain...

33:38.087 --> 33:39.486
experiences.

33:41.247 --> 33:45.035
- Throwing up mornings, as an example.
- I see.

33:45.847 --> 33:49.396
And I'd say, not claiming credentials...

33:49.487 --> 33:51.239
for raising a family, as...

33:52.007 --> 33:53.804
my time with them was...

33:54.287 --> 33:55.481
brief.

33:56.327 --> 33:59.797
But I'd hope it'd testify to willingness...

34:00.407 --> 34:03.001
as a candidate for...

34:03.167 --> 34:05.362
marriage, and so forth.

34:07.687 --> 34:09.324
Offering myself.

34:14.887 --> 34:18.277
Completing the sorry presentation.

34:23.567 --> 34:27.924
I'm deeply grateful for your proposal.

34:31.607 --> 34:36.043
May I ask a brief interval before
giving you my answer?

34:36.246 --> 34:38.556
Long as you like.

34:38.647 --> 34:42.764
- It will give me time to get up.
- I'll ask...

34:43.286 --> 34:47.360
a little longer than that,
and some solitude.

34:49.206 --> 34:50.799
Of course.

34:53.487 --> 34:57.480
Thank you very much, Mr Ellsworth.

34:59.927 --> 35:01.280
Yes, ma'am.

35:11.167 --> 35:14.716
- Is the boy warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.

35:26.687 --> 35:30.236
This roof over our heads, Mr Bullock...

35:30.327 --> 35:32.921
testifies to your care for
William and me.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.962
The fostering affection and guidance...

35:36.287 --> 35:40.678
you show my son
to shape him into a man...

35:41.207 --> 35:43.596
will only deepen my gratitude to you.

35:45.647 --> 35:47.285
As for myself...

35:48.847 --> 35:52.317
no further demonstrations
are necessary as...

35:53.567 --> 35:55.683
other duties claim your attentions.

35:56.367 --> 35:59.404
None such as you conceive
since your arrival...

35:59.487 --> 36:03.082
nor will they again,
whatever the state of our relations.

36:04.647 --> 36:08.560
Do not sacrifice further
on my account, Mr Bullock.

36:12.247 --> 36:15.603
I reject the offering. I repudiate it.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.804
I find it poisonous.

36:36.927 --> 36:40.442
Not the eyesore of my previous visit?

36:40.527 --> 36:45.203
Ah, Al, welcome. Yes, yes.
Tidied and reconstituted...

36:45.287 --> 36:48.120
prompted in no small measure,
I might add, by your...

36:48.207 --> 36:50.357
very much appreciated exhortation.

36:50.527 --> 36:54.042
I just jotted a few fucking thoughts
down for your perusal.

36:54.127 --> 36:55.765
In what regard?

36:55.927 --> 36:58.441
Well, peruse it,
and you'll fucking find out.

37:00.047 --> 37:02.720
What the fuck is this?

37:03.087 --> 37:07.558
That is a telegraph apparatus,
whose operator, Mr Blasanov...

37:07.647 --> 37:10.002
presently is taking the air.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.277
"Sheriff Bullock would not confirm
having met with representatives...

37:14.367 --> 37:18.440
"from the Montana territory
to discuss their offer of annexation. "

37:19.367 --> 37:22.643
- Is this true, Al?
- Did he fucking confirm it to you?

37:23.047 --> 37:25.242
- I haven't spoken to Bullock.
- So...

37:25.487 --> 37:27.955
then I guess it ain't confirmed.

37:28.287 --> 37:31.324
Answer me this fucking question.
Why in fuck...

37:31.687 --> 37:34.201
do I find out about
this telegraph operator...

37:34.287 --> 37:36.721
arriving tardily and by accident?

37:37.007 --> 37:40.795
I wasn't aware that you were owed
official notification.

37:40.887 --> 37:44.482
Merrick, you and me are allies...

37:45.167 --> 37:48.682
marching into battle together,
and aren't smart-assed...

37:48.767 --> 37:52.203
replies amongst allies
a waste of fucking time?

37:53.567 --> 37:56.923
Allies? Marching?

37:57.047 --> 38:00.437
"Allies? Marching?"
is exactly fucking right.

38:00.527 --> 38:03.166
And this operator hitting camp is big.

38:03.287 --> 38:05.721
The main dereliction is Farnum's...

38:05.807 --> 38:09.117
whose bailiwick specifically is
new arrivals.

38:09.247 --> 38:11.841
But you have also been fucking remiss.

38:11.967 --> 38:16.438
What battle are we marching toward
in formation of some sort, Al?

38:17.727 --> 38:21.003
I purchased a sleeping equipment.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.000
Mr Blasanov, Mr. Swearengen.

38:27.727 --> 38:29.763
How do you do, Mr Swearengen?

38:29.927 --> 38:33.317
All right, Blasanov. That's some
pronounced fucking accent you've got.

38:33.407 --> 38:35.045
I am Russian.

38:36.407 --> 38:40.002
Now, you could have waited saying that
before I was fucking seated, huh?

38:41.287 --> 38:43.755
Mr Swearengen was
keenly interested to hear...

38:43.847 --> 38:46.441
that you're the camp's
telegraph operator.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.239
- How do you do?
- Oh, no, no, no. How do you do?

38:52.447 --> 38:55.519
You are the master of
the fucking secret code...

38:55.607 --> 38:57.882
and all the other fucking
secret things, isn't that right?

38:57.967 --> 39:02.119
- Not so secret.
- No, that's some fucking skill.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.960
I'm sure people are trying to
bribe you right and left?

39:05.047 --> 39:09.245
- No, no. I'm not allowed.
- Nor am I, no.

39:09.327 --> 39:10.726
None of us are.

39:10.807 --> 39:15.244
We are, every one, strictly forbade.
That's the fucking beauty of it all.

39:15.607 --> 39:19.486
I think I haven't enough
English for you...

39:20.007 --> 39:22.441
- Mr Swearengen.
- Bullshit.

39:22.887 --> 39:25.720
You have the perfect,
exact fucking amount.

39:25.807 --> 39:27.957
My only question for you, young man...

39:28.047 --> 39:29.560
is your feelings on...

39:30.007 --> 39:33.602
your prick being sucked constantly
and without charge, yeah?

39:37.447 --> 39:41.520
And thus you encounter one of
our wonderful meaningless...

39:41.607 --> 39:45.725
American traditions, Mr Blasanov,
the tall-tale conversation...

39:46.247 --> 39:49.956
and tales and good nature.

39:50.487 --> 39:53.001
The Gem, Blasanov...

39:53.207 --> 39:56.677
my saloon. Very convenient to
your place of business?

39:56.847 --> 39:59.919
Via private walkway,
which I will employ as we speak...

40:00.007 --> 40:01.918
or by the public thoroughfare.

40:02.447 --> 40:05.598
Visit, and you will experience
a tradition...

40:08.007 --> 40:11.283
only used in this camp or my place...

40:11.487 --> 40:16.277
by newly-arrived telegraph operators,
fucking free.

40:16.887 --> 40:19.321
Be their preference of tail tall...

40:19.407 --> 40:24.003
or fucking otherwise.
And by all means, welcome to America.

40:34.687 --> 40:36.040
Evening, Bill.

40:39.047 --> 40:42.437
Jane ain't with me, 'cause she's
a drunken fucking mess...

40:42.527 --> 40:44.677
and I don't know what to do about it.

40:46.767 --> 40:50.362
I know you want her looked out for,
and I'm doing my fucking best.

40:51.407 --> 40:54.046
But I won't stand before you
claiming optimism.

40:59.047 --> 41:00.400
Other news...

41:01.247 --> 41:05.160
That letter you wrote your wife just
before that cocksucker murdered you...

41:05.367 --> 41:06.800
it come to my hand.

41:08.167 --> 41:11.125
I won't even try explaining fucking how.

41:13.247 --> 41:15.681
And knowing what we know about
our fucked-up postal system...

41:15.767 --> 41:18.235
I ain't committing it to the fucking mails.

41:19.927 --> 41:22.441
You know I'll try to get it to her...

41:22.607 --> 41:25.565
which I pray be a portion off your mind.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.681
When I've found where she's at...

41:32.207 --> 41:34.721
on my way setting off, I'll tell you.

41:37.647 --> 41:41.765
All right. God bless you, Bill.

41:44.207 --> 41:47.324
And as far as Jane,
as drunk as you've seen her...

41:48.087 --> 41:50.157
you've never seen her this worse.

41:50.327 --> 41:53.717
Between us, maybe having lost...

41:53.847 --> 41:55.246
wanting to keep on.

41:57.607 --> 42:00.121
So I don't know what the fuck to do!

42:06.367 --> 42:09.086
But you know I'll... I'll keep trying.

42:46.007 --> 42:47.838
Is this adequate, Mr Manuel?

42:48.287 --> 42:50.721
Your brother's mortal remains
are housed inside...

42:50.807 --> 42:52.525
under the care of Mr Lee.

42:55.807 --> 42:59.038
- Do you speak Chinese?
- I do not, sir.

42:59.207 --> 43:01.323
However you accomplish
communication...

43:01.407 --> 43:03.602
with that son of a bitch,
then the more the...

43:03.687 --> 43:05.917
disgrace to your soul!

43:10.407 --> 43:11.920
Are we through here?

43:12.007 --> 43:14.441
Can we finally complete
our transaction?

43:14.807 --> 43:17.116
It fucking happens,
the fucking gun he was cleaning...

43:17.207 --> 43:18.606
when he shot himself was mine.

43:18.687 --> 43:21.360
- Is that so?
- And I'm asking to know if a person of...

43:21.447 --> 43:26.362
the mind to blame me will have a way
to recover the fucking bullet?

43:26.447 --> 43:30.122
I expect not, Mr Manuel,
or that other than yours...

43:30.207 --> 43:33.563
any such mind is in the camp.
And suggest you think of other things...

43:33.647 --> 43:35.160
like the money that Mr Tolliver's...

43:35.247 --> 43:37.807
waiting to present to you
at the Bella Union.

43:38.527 --> 43:42.679
That easy! To forget a fucking brother!

43:42.847 --> 43:44.997
Money has properties in this regard!

43:46.687 --> 43:48.439
Though no remedy is discovered yet...

43:48.527 --> 43:50.916
sovereign against sentimental remorse.

43:52.367 --> 43:54.164
Close your eyes!

44:14.047 --> 44:15.366
It's open.

44:28.727 --> 44:30.479
Do what you came to.

44:34.447 --> 44:36.802
I don't know what I came to do.

44:38.647 --> 44:40.797
Is it easier saying that?

44:42.647 --> 44:44.478
The other nights I've known.

44:45.727 --> 44:50.164
You're supposed to look out for that
madam, fucking asleep at the switch.

44:59.007 --> 45:02.636
Where's fucking Charlie to piss in
my ear when he's fucking needed?

45:09.887 --> 45:13.436
Basil Hayden bourbon,
you were waiting for me.

45:13.847 --> 45:16.122
No, my friend Jane left that.

45:22.247 --> 45:24.158
And you leave me alone!

45:27.607 --> 45:29.757
And I got a fucking gun in here, too!

45:31.367 --> 45:33.085
And get the fuck out!

45:34.567 --> 45:36.876
And lock the front fucking door!

45:59.287 --> 46:03.439
- Are you the fucking cocksucker?
- I may well be.

46:04.607 --> 46:07.599
Did you just kill that girl
in the Chez Ami?

46:07.687 --> 46:10.645
I did not.
That girl in the Chez Ami is well.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.718
Well, whose blood's on
your fucking mug?

46:12.807 --> 46:16.038
My own. My name is Francis Wolcott.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.518
If you find me untrue in any particular...

46:18.607 --> 46:20.677
I stay at the Grand Central Hotel.

46:22.727 --> 46:24.763
Who runs that joint?

46:25.567 --> 46:27.762
A grotesque named Farnum.

46:30.767 --> 46:33.042
You ain't lied so far.
