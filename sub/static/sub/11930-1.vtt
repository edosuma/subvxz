WEBVTT

01:10.169 --> 01:11.570
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:11.670 --> 01:15.207
Dad, we have to discuss
my allowance I need a raise.

01:15.307 --> 01:18.243
Alex, buying your girlfriend more
gummi bears won't close the deal.

01:18.343 --> 01:20.279
- Like you'd know.
- Alex.

01:20.379 --> 01:24.550
But Mom, Cody's almost 16
and I've had twice as many dates as him.

01:24.650 --> 01:27.586
Sitting in a tree house
isn't exactly a date.

01:27.686 --> 01:30.519
- It is when you're playing doctor.
- Bye!

01:36.462 --> 01:38.987
You smell good. Did you shave?

01:41.133 --> 01:43.669
- Don't forget your chores.
- I'll do them later.

01:43.769 --> 01:47.206
Cody, those guinea pigs have been
sitting in excrement for days.

01:47.306 --> 01:50.976
Alex, you play with them more than I do,
how about we trade chores?

01:51.076 --> 01:52.611
I'll mow the lawn three times.

01:52.711 --> 01:57.410
No way. Just cos I'm ten doesn't mean I'm
Idiot, I don't know what excrement means.

01:58.517 --> 02:00.382
We're eating here.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.600
Sweetie, Mommy will be right back.

02:59.878 --> 03:02.514
My baby! My baby's in that car!

03:02.614 --> 03:04.707
Somebody stop that car!

03:49.962 --> 03:52.021
Unlock the door!

03:58.604 --> 04:00.765
Hey, kid! Get out the way!

04:54.960 --> 04:57.258
Next time, please stick with a tricycle.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.771
Sweetie, it's OK.

05:20.352 --> 05:23.014
- What happened?
- Some kid stopped it.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.238
Dr. Connors, we've given you
a great deal of money.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.244
We expect results.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.349
If you gentlemen would step
this way, please? Gather round.

05:55.787 --> 06:00.325
Imagine we're somewhere in Alaska
and an oil tanker runs aground.

06:00.425 --> 06:02.928
What do we get?

06:03.028 --> 06:05.597
An oil spill, one of the most serious
threats to nature.

06:05.697 --> 06:09.401
A calamity that could take generations
for sea life to recover.

06:09.501 --> 06:12.104
But wait - what's this?

06:12.204 --> 06:13.872
Look who's coming.

06:13.972 --> 06:16.202
The nanobots.

06:29.221 --> 06:31.212
Lovely.

06:34.159 --> 06:37.890
Baby seals everywhere
will praise your name, Doctor.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.968
So, is that real oil, Connors?

06:43.068 --> 06:45.404
Oh, yeah.

06:45.504 --> 06:48.496
Here's a sample.
You can test it if you want.

06:51.343 --> 06:54.079
Can they be programmed
to eat anything other than oil?

06:54.179 --> 06:59.251
Theoretically they could break down
any silicon- or carbon-based compound.

06:59.351 --> 07:01.012
- You have ten days.
- What?

07:02.954 --> 07:05.684
- That's impossible.
- He said you have ten days.

07:06.591 --> 07:08.957
We have our own agenda, Doctor.

07:09.995 --> 07:13.498
- That's impossible.
- Goodbye, Dr. Connors.

07:13.598 --> 07:15.767
He still has no idea
what we hope to achieve.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.698
Let's keep it that way, François.

07:30.048 --> 07:33.118
- I told you no ice. Here.
- I'm sorry, sir.

07:33.218 --> 07:35.721
You never know how long
it's been in the freezer,

07:35.821 --> 07:38.619
could be filled with all kind of crap.

07:40.525 --> 07:42.516
This is Dr. Albert Connors.

07:44.296 --> 07:48.892
The world's foremost expert in
nanotechnology - microscopic robots.

07:50.802 --> 07:52.738
These robots could be programmed

07:52.838 --> 07:56.742
to destroy our most vital communication
and military infrastructure.

07:56.842 --> 08:00.145
I'm talking missile guidance systems,
boats, tanks,

08:00.245 --> 08:02.180
planes, biological and...

08:02.280 --> 08:04.583
We get the point. Before we lost contact,

08:04.683 --> 08:08.653
Agent Bolivar confirmed that Connors
is working with E.R.I.S.

08:08.753 --> 08:12.655
This is probably my last transmission.
I think they're onto me.

08:13.158 --> 08:16.661
Don't send any more agents,
everyone has been compromised.

08:16.761 --> 08:19.030
I'd better transmit images now.

08:19.130 --> 08:22.868
This is yesterday
at the E.R.I.S. Covert conference

08:22.968 --> 08:25.937
where Dr. Connors demonstrated
his latest advancements.

08:26.037 --> 08:29.438
And this is Dr. Brinkman, head of E.R.I.S.

08:29.975 --> 08:33.933
And this, François Molay, his henchman.

08:34.546 --> 08:37.174
As far as I understand it, they plan...

08:44.121 --> 08:46.291
We need to know what they're planning.

08:46.391 --> 08:49.827
The problem is, Connors is very reclusive.

08:50.729 --> 08:54.433
After his wife died two years ago,
Connors dropped out of public view.

08:54.533 --> 08:59.197
His only contact with the outside world
is through his daughter Natalie.

09:00.872 --> 09:03.363
I wanna get close to this girl.

09:04.910 --> 09:06.411
McAllister,

09:06.511 --> 09:09.378
brief the staff
on the Agent Development Program.

09:10.515 --> 09:15.543
Under the guise of an elite summer camp,
we began to recruit.

09:17.222 --> 09:19.558
Welcome to the Agent Development Program.

09:19.658 --> 09:21.993
Since 1987, and under strict secrecy,

09:22.093 --> 09:24.963
the CIA has recruited juvenile agents
the nation over.

09:25.063 --> 09:28.467
As soon as we received word that
a potential candidate had been spotted,

09:28.567 --> 09:33.772
we brought them into our facilities
under the guise of summer camps.

09:33.872 --> 09:37.108
Their parents had no idea
of their real activities.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.145
They were expertly trained
in combat, defense,

09:40.245 --> 09:43.582
navigation and, of course,
explosives defusion.

09:43.682 --> 09:47.152
Our juvenile agents
are stationed all over the nation.

09:47.252 --> 09:50.755
They meticulously maintain
the facades of normal childhoods

09:50.855 --> 09:52.991
as they await their call for duty.

09:53.091 --> 09:55.060
Wait, wait, wait.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.864
You're telling me we're training
children to become agents?

09:58.964 --> 10:02.667
Teenagers.
Look, let's be clear about this...

10:02.767 --> 10:05.370
this may be our last best chance.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.405
These kids operate alone?

10:07.505 --> 10:10.876
No, that would be irresponsible.

10:10.976 --> 10:15.247
One of our most impressive agents.
Lives not far from Natalie Connors.

10:15.347 --> 10:17.713
Smart, resourceful,

10:18.717 --> 10:21.049
and, according to my reports,

10:22.854 --> 10:24.845
he's quite a lady-killer.

10:27.926 --> 10:29.861
Do you...?

10:29.961 --> 10:32.156
Hi, Cody.

10:39.170 --> 10:41.138
Are you in special ed?

10:49.714 --> 10:51.650
Hi, Cody!

10:51.750 --> 10:54.052
Do you think, Amy, that...

10:54.152 --> 10:55.921
Friday night we...

10:56.021 --> 10:58.623
Cody, I need to study,

10:58.723 --> 11:02.056
so why don't you go jump off a cliff
or something?

11:25.650 --> 11:27.880
Cody Banks.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.656
You want him?

11:31.756 --> 11:33.458
She wants Cody.

11:33.558 --> 11:37.119
Quiet! Or you'll all be in trouble.

11:39.931 --> 11:42.734
- You, come with me.
- Why?

11:42.834 --> 11:44.995
Hey, I wanna be in trouble.

11:52.410 --> 11:56.210
Since you're on the business
of taking towels, take mine too.

11:56.915 --> 11:59.351
Could you hold this, please? Thank you.

11:59.451 --> 12:01.385
I really hate it...

12:02.087 --> 12:04.055
when people talk back.

12:09.427 --> 12:10.829
Thank you. Let's go.

12:10.929 --> 12:12.920
Who are you? What did I do?

12:17.769 --> 12:21.637
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.113
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

12:28.213 --> 12:30.382
Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.283
How many pieces do you wish?

12:32.383 --> 12:37.150
This is what happens when you design
a code book at summer camp!

12:41.292 --> 12:44.295
So I'm being called up?
My country needs me?

12:44.395 --> 12:46.331
- Yep.
- Where are we going?

12:46.431 --> 12:49.768
The Middle East? Russia? China?

12:49.868 --> 12:51.859
Downtown Seattle.

13:09.654 --> 13:12.223
I'm in! My first mission!

13:12.323 --> 13:14.726
Didn't think it would happen this soon?

13:14.826 --> 13:17.495
Plus, I didn't think my partner was...

13:17.595 --> 13:21.332
Let's get one thing straight,
I am not your partner.

13:21.432 --> 13:23.535
I'm your handler.

13:23.635 --> 13:25.626
Like in the zoo.

13:29.841 --> 13:31.776
You will speak only when spoken to,

13:31.876 --> 13:34.512
you will follow orders without question.

13:34.612 --> 13:36.603
If you're lucky, you might...

13:42.187 --> 13:45.023
How did you get in here?
There's no school tour today.

13:45.123 --> 13:48.259
I'm not on a school tour. I'm an agent.

13:48.359 --> 13:52.297
I just came from basketball practice,
I left my ID in my other clothes.

13:52.397 --> 13:55.059
- I'm with Ronica Miles.
- You wish!

13:56.668 --> 13:58.659
Here he is.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.943
Sir, I've apprehended a trespasser.
It was a bit of a struggle.

14:05.043 --> 14:07.178
- What's your name?
- Rosychuk.

14:07.278 --> 14:09.269
Come here, Rosychuk.

14:09.914 --> 14:14.482
You know, you've just apprehended
the most important kid in America!

14:17.155 --> 14:19.924
Mr. Banks, this way, this way.

14:20.024 --> 14:22.015
What was he thinking?

14:22.594 --> 14:24.858
You got agent written all over you.

14:26.764 --> 14:29.067
It's in the eyes.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.499
You got it, kid. Come on.

14:32.704 --> 14:34.695
Welcome to the CIA.

14:35.573 --> 14:39.304
So you like the Sonics? What about
front-row seats for the play-offs?

14:42.780 --> 14:46.050
We've prepared a briefing
to explain nanobots to you.

14:46.150 --> 14:49.120
Yeah, I know them.
Tiny weapons, giant potential.

14:49.220 --> 14:53.458
Micro-devices built up of compounds
of polymer cobalt and gold,

14:53.558 --> 14:57.662
or constructed with multiple fullerene
complexes called buckysomes,

14:57.762 --> 15:00.765
universal assemblers
that can bond circuits,

15:00.865 --> 15:02.801
with the most impressive tests

15:02.901 --> 15:06.337
having been conducted
at Sweden's Lintzerpein University.

15:10.642 --> 15:13.278
I guess we can move on.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.947
Let's turn to Natalie Connors.

15:16.047 --> 15:19.884
Natalie Connors, 15 years old.
Hair blonde, eyes brown.

15:19.984 --> 15:22.387
Likes horses... preferably Arabians...

15:22.487 --> 15:25.657
pistachio ice cream, turquoise jewelry,

15:25.757 --> 15:27.692
and TS Eliot.

15:27.792 --> 15:31.729
Learn everything you can about this girl.
I want you to get close to her.

15:31.829 --> 15:35.066
That's my mission?
I have to get close to her?

15:35.166 --> 15:38.136
Yes. Insinuate yourself into her life.

15:38.236 --> 15:42.874
It is imperative you find out what
her father and E.R.I.S. Are planning.

15:42.974 --> 15:46.477
We'll help.
We've placed you in all of her classes.

15:46.577 --> 15:49.714
All of them? Isn't that a little creepy?

15:49.814 --> 15:51.549
Creepy?

15:51.649 --> 15:55.710
We're the CIA, that's what we do. Right?

15:59.824 --> 16:02.418
You want me to become her boyfriend?

16:04.495 --> 16:09.234
It's simple. Natalie has a birthday soon.
Her father's throwing a party.

16:09.334 --> 16:11.996
The first step is to get invited
to that party.

16:12.637 --> 16:17.342
And be careful. This is not secret agent
little league any more.

16:17.442 --> 16:20.809
This is the show, Mr. Banks,
and this is showtime.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.972
If you can't handle it,
you just tell me now.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.410
You can count on me.

16:38.629 --> 16:40.961
Attention. Rocket launch test.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.940
I know it's tempting
but don't touch anything.

16:50.608 --> 16:52.744
Four, three,

16:52.844 --> 16:54.835
two, one.

17:02.854 --> 17:05.117
Mr. Banks, come see me, son.

17:07.858 --> 17:10.094
I've prepared a number of dope items

17:10.194 --> 17:13.097
which I think you're gonna be down with.

17:13.196 --> 17:16.601
This item here is equipped
with a virtual telephoto lens,

17:16.701 --> 17:19.499
low-penetration X-ray.

17:21.739 --> 17:23.730
Give me that!

17:24.342 --> 17:26.277
This is your cell phone.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.247
It's a state-of-the-art
mobile command center

17:29.347 --> 17:31.783
with a holographic audiovisual display

17:31.883 --> 17:34.147
and a personal GPS transceiver.

17:36.888 --> 17:41.392
Now, this is a CIA
get-out-of-trouble watch.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.428
See this silver button?

17:43.528 --> 17:46.731
Be very careful
with this little silver button

17:46.831 --> 17:48.992
cos it'll make people go...

17:49.934 --> 17:52.003
Wait, what was that?

17:52.103 --> 17:53.832
Wait, one more time.

17:56.741 --> 17:58.732
I don't even wanna know.

18:03.014 --> 18:05.005
All right, let's wrap this up.

18:05.983 --> 18:08.286
Five thousand dollars cash.

18:08.386 --> 18:11.055
What for?

18:11.155 --> 18:14.993
I think they buy things with it.
I don't know. I believe.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.694
OK, that's it.

18:16.794 --> 18:18.730
Thanks for coming.

18:18.830 --> 18:21.833
Wait. I think we're forgetting something.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.502
- I'm not.
- What about those wheels?

18:24.602 --> 18:29.173
No, Cody, that's on a need-to-drive basis.
You don't need to drive.

18:29.273 --> 18:31.676
I need to impress the girls.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.904
So we got you fixed up. Look at this.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.916
This thing is really full of surprises.

18:39.016 --> 18:41.883
- Fine.
- I think you're gonna impress the girls.

18:44.088 --> 18:46.613
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

18:47.658 --> 18:50.261
You're transferring to a prep school?

18:50.361 --> 18:53.931
Yeah, I got a full scholarship
to Donovan Prep Academy.

18:54.031 --> 18:56.000
A scholarship? Hold on.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.470
I don't understand. When did you apply?
Did I sign something?

18:59.570 --> 19:03.007
Yeah, a few months ago.
It's always been my dream to go there.

19:03.107 --> 19:06.110
It has? But what about your friends?

19:06.210 --> 19:09.247
- I'll make new ones.
- With all those spoiled brats?

19:09.347 --> 19:12.250
And why would they want you?

19:12.350 --> 19:17.088
Diversity. At least five per cent
of the students have to be normal.

19:17.188 --> 19:19.123
I don't know about this.

19:19.223 --> 19:21.559
I wanna make something very clear,

19:21.659 --> 19:27.120
I am not agreeing to anything until I meet
an administrator from that school.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.759
Mr. Banks.

19:32.803 --> 19:36.040
Ronica Miles from the William Donovan
Preparatory Academy.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.131
I'm an administrator from the school.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.342
Agent Banks.

19:46.050 --> 19:48.586
I heard you really closed
the deal with Amy.

19:48.686 --> 19:51.556
- You should try gummi bears.
- How do you know about that?

19:51.656 --> 19:55.183
- Everybody knows.
- She thinks I'm a loser.

19:56.294 --> 19:58.729
Amy, I...

19:58.829 --> 20:00.990
I'm in high school.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.672
Cody is a wonderful student with
extraordinary math and science abilities.

20:07.772 --> 20:11.275
- What is it exactly that you do?
- Dean of admissions.

20:11.375 --> 20:15.880
Donovan Academy feels he isn't being
challenged in his current environment.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.416
Do you have some kind of paperwork?

20:18.516 --> 20:20.507
Of course.

20:30.828 --> 20:32.887
You guys ready for the test?

20:37.602 --> 20:39.804
- Nervous?
- No.

20:39.904 --> 20:41.633
Got your schedule?

20:43.674 --> 20:46.438
"Honors English, trig, chemistry"?

20:47.812 --> 20:51.115
I don't need all of this.
I could just meet her between classes.

20:51.215 --> 20:54.152
You will attend every class as instructed.

20:54.252 --> 20:56.554
You might even learn something.

20:56.654 --> 20:59.390
This isn't what I had in mind
when I signed on to the CIA.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.760
Well, I didn't think
I'd be chaperoning teenagers.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.590
You know, maybe you should try decaf.

21:10.968 --> 21:13.137
It's my job to make sure you do your job.

21:13.237 --> 21:15.398
If you screw up, I take the heat.

21:17.675 --> 21:21.133
So I guess she grows on you. Right?

21:22.446 --> 21:24.215
No.

21:24.315 --> 21:27.218
Admission papers, hat.

21:27.318 --> 21:29.120
Hat? What hat?

21:29.220 --> 21:32.256
Seattle Seahawks,
they're her favorite football team.

21:32.356 --> 21:34.292
You know, it's an icebreaker.

21:34.392 --> 21:36.883
A conversation starter.

21:38.896 --> 21:41.865
Look! That guy has a bird on his head.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.429
- Guys!
- No, it looks good.

21:47.104 --> 21:50.007
I'm not wearing this,
I look like an idiot.

21:50.107 --> 21:54.441
There's two minutes till first period,
you don't wanna be tardy.

21:58.849 --> 22:00.551
What if she doesn't like me?

22:00.651 --> 22:03.245
What's not to like?

22:42.860 --> 22:44.851
Sorry.

22:59.877 --> 23:01.868
Target acquired.

23:05.983 --> 23:07.451
New kid.

23:07.551 --> 23:10.321
You're the scholarship case
from the other side of town, right?

23:10.421 --> 23:13.524
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Cody. Banks.

23:13.624 --> 23:16.894
Banks? We got something in common, Cody.

23:16.994 --> 23:18.929
My dad owns banks.

23:19.029 --> 23:21.998
- Very funny. I gotta go.
- Not so fast.

23:23.434 --> 23:25.595
Check it out.

23:26.537 --> 23:29.906
- Come on, give it back.
- What are you gonna do about it?

23:45.022 --> 23:47.391
If you're gonna keep my watch,

23:47.491 --> 23:50.094
promise me you won't touch
that silver button.

23:50.194 --> 23:52.719
- That silver button?
- Yeah, don't touch it.

24:02.039 --> 24:04.200
I told you not to touch it.

24:18.589 --> 24:20.580
Are those books?

24:22.293 --> 24:26.497
I love books. I gotta read all day.
Love 'em.

24:26.597 --> 24:29.259
Great. Then you're in the right place.

24:31.435 --> 24:33.767
I especially love TS Eliot.

24:35.039 --> 24:38.075
- You do?
- I think she's amazing.

24:38.175 --> 24:42.446
The way she captures the female
perspective is just so female-like.

24:42.546 --> 24:44.537
It's great.

24:45.015 --> 24:47.685
TS Eliot is a man.

24:47.785 --> 24:51.889
If you wanna get technical, of course,
but you never know these days.

24:51.989 --> 24:55.626
Do you by any chance
happen to be in special ed?

24:55.726 --> 24:57.495
I love horses.

24:57.595 --> 24:59.196
I think...

24:59.296 --> 25:01.696
their hair thing is really cool.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.424
What a freak.

25:08.639 --> 25:13.411
...two and divide by x minus two
and we'll end up with...

25:13.511 --> 25:17.415
Natalie Connors. Way out of your league.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.915
...point 4968. Any questions?

25:22.820 --> 25:25.015
Driver's Ed.

25:26.023 --> 25:30.357
- Oh, my God. Are you gonna go?
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.

25:32.963 --> 25:35.898
- Uh-oh, here comes horse guy.
- Good luck.

25:38.536 --> 25:41.561
Hey. You got Driver's Ed too?

25:42.106 --> 25:45.009
What's the deal?
You're in every one of my classes.

25:45.109 --> 25:47.668
I guess great minds think alike.

25:50.881 --> 25:54.285
Great, we've got Mr. Yip.
He doesn't pass anybody.

25:54.385 --> 25:57.788
Look, if you don't pass,
I'm sure your dad can drive you around.

25:57.888 --> 26:00.991
It's because of my dad
that I need a license.

26:01.091 --> 26:04.261
- So you can drive him around?
- No, so I can drive me around.

26:04.361 --> 26:06.897
- Why, is he busy with something?
- Yeah.

26:06.997 --> 26:09.099
He's always doing some kind of experiment.

26:09.199 --> 26:12.603
- Like a scientific experiment?
- Yeah, he's a scientist.

26:12.703 --> 26:16.764
- Cool! With microscopes?
- You're getting weird again.

26:19.743 --> 26:22.303
Good afternoon, children.

26:22.980 --> 26:26.506
Driving is a privilege, not a right.

26:27.051 --> 26:31.989
I'd be delighted to instruct you
in operation of motor vehicle.

26:32.089 --> 26:38.295
But, I have a larger responsibility
to protect society at large

26:38.395 --> 26:41.799
from the idiots
and the drug-addled delinquents

26:41.899 --> 26:44.802
who call themselves...

26:44.902 --> 26:46.670
the youth of today.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.761
Today!

26:53.444 --> 26:55.878
You name Miss Connors?

26:56.914 --> 26:59.250
Yeah? You first!

26:59.350 --> 27:01.318
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

27:08.726 --> 27:10.761
Look left, look right!

27:10.861 --> 27:13.998
You didn't turn on your blinks!
Are you dyslexic?

27:14.098 --> 27:17.192
This is your left, that is your right.

27:17.635 --> 27:20.638
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the driver's seat!

27:20.738 --> 27:22.433
OK, I...

27:25.743 --> 27:29.076
One grandma. Multiple cones, three curbs.

27:30.314 --> 27:34.218
- Who can drive with you screaming?
- You fail. Fail! Fail!

27:34.318 --> 27:37.617
- No, I need to get my license.
- Next!

27:39.590 --> 27:41.981
Damn, the floor mat isn't straight.

27:47.498 --> 27:49.932
- All ready.
- Good.

27:55.639 --> 27:57.436
What are you doing now?

28:17.695 --> 28:20.163
What are you doing now?

28:35.379 --> 28:38.746
Stop the car! Stop the car right now!

28:44.621 --> 28:46.624
- Did I pass?
- Nat, are you OK?

28:46.724 --> 28:49.522
Oh, my God, he almost rolled over.

28:50.561 --> 28:54.064
- Come on.
- Actually, I don't feel so good.

28:54.164 --> 28:56.359
He totally could have killed you.

28:57.401 --> 28:59.637
Just stay away from her.

28:59.737 --> 29:01.534
Are you OK?

29:06.043 --> 29:10.381
You! I will personally go to DMV.

29:10.481 --> 29:14.679
You will not receive a driver's license!

29:18.756 --> 29:20.314
Never!

29:25.729 --> 29:27.890
- Mr. Yip.
- What?

29:28.932 --> 29:32.469
We'd like to have a word about
Mr. Banks' driver's license.

29:32.569 --> 29:34.627
Immigrations paper OK!

29:36.974 --> 29:38.965
My fellow agents.

29:44.815 --> 29:47.384
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

29:47.484 --> 29:49.475
- He's dead.
- So dead.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.022
Hey, Cody.

29:52.122 --> 29:54.925
- How did it go today?
- Great.

29:55.025 --> 29:56.960
I've got her eating out of my hand.

29:57.060 --> 30:00.831
Fantastic.
So, she invited you to the party?

30:00.931 --> 30:02.922
No, but the vibes are right.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.703
- Have you asked her out yet?
- Not yet. But don't rush me.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.842
The clock's ticking. What about tonight?

30:24.888 --> 30:27.448
It's a school night. I got homework.

30:34.298 --> 30:37.901
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, but Natalie's a brain.

30:38.001 --> 30:40.561
All those AP classes.
My workload's insane.

30:42.773 --> 30:45.765
- This mission depends on you.
- I know, but...

30:47.945 --> 30:51.348
Come on. Tonight I had to do
two chapters of trigonometry.

30:51.448 --> 30:54.884
Plus an essay on Henry V,
not to mention my chores.

30:58.121 --> 31:02.426
- Of course, if I had a little help...
- I can't believe this.

31:02.526 --> 31:07.531
All right... The agency will take care
of your chores and your homework.

31:07.631 --> 31:09.963
You focus on the girl.

31:31.989 --> 31:34.423
Teams A and B commence
domestic sanitation.

31:39.630 --> 31:43.567
Team three, I need a new sponge.
Repeat, need a new sponge, over.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.658
You missed a spot.

31:48.739 --> 31:51.936
Negative, negative.
Stand by, flannel only...

31:53.644 --> 31:56.446
Which one would you prefer...
this one or this one?

31:56.546 --> 31:58.816
- I like this myself.
- Good choice.

31:58.916 --> 32:01.385
We have dust bunnies on the second floor.

32:01.485 --> 32:05.683
...to develop a secret weapon.
I'm gonna transmit images now.

32:06.657 --> 32:10.060
This is Dr. Brinkman,
head of E.R.I.S., and this...

32:10.160 --> 32:13.061
François Molay, his henchman.

32:18.869 --> 32:21.872
- Get out of the house!
- What? They're here?

32:21.972 --> 32:24.474
They shouldn't be here for another hour.

32:24.574 --> 32:27.134
- I don't know...
- Come on. Move, move.

32:40.357 --> 32:43.594
- Move it, get out of there.
- Get that thing out of there.

32:43.694 --> 32:45.924
Right there, let's go.

32:48.532 --> 32:53.196
Wait! Wait, wait, wait...
You will wait for me!

33:03.413 --> 33:07.484
Wow, what are they teaching
the kid at that new school?

33:07.584 --> 33:09.575
Oh, my God, look at this.

33:11.455 --> 33:13.446
Holy sh...

33:27.704 --> 33:30.340
I know it's your dream
to play for the Sonics

33:30.440 --> 33:34.478
but if that falls through,
you'd make somebody a good janitor.

33:34.578 --> 33:37.281
Well, you told me to do my chores.

33:37.381 --> 33:40.250
Honey, we are very impressed.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.952
Here's five bucks.

33:42.052 --> 33:44.452
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

33:56.933 --> 33:59.527
I'm gonna go take Marvin for a walk.

34:18.388 --> 34:21.949
- Your homework to your satisfaction?
- Yeah.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.617
Your room is nice and tidy?

34:25.395 --> 34:28.665
- Guinea pig cage is clean?
- Yeah.

34:28.764 --> 34:31.568
Well, I think we've done our part.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.136
Now you do yours. Call Natalie.

34:35.205 --> 34:37.541
In here?

34:37.641 --> 34:39.476
Hurry.

34:39.576 --> 34:41.668
I'll do it in my room.

34:46.917 --> 34:48.908
He pooped twice.

35:00.197 --> 35:03.655
- That wasn't me.
- I don't smell anything.

35:06.369 --> 35:08.360
Get out! Everybody out!

35:09.506 --> 35:11.838
Hello, Natalie. Guess who.

35:15.412 --> 35:17.903
Hey, pretty lady. What's goin' on?

35:21.251 --> 35:24.482
Dude. Natalie. How are you doing?

35:28.325 --> 35:29.926
Hi, Natalie, it's Cody.

35:30.026 --> 35:33.359
I was wondering
what you were doing this Saturday.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.206
Hello?

35:48.912 --> 35:51.039
Who is this?

35:56.219 --> 35:58.155
This mission is screwed.

35:58.255 --> 36:00.824
We spent $10million training this kid

36:00.924 --> 36:04.194
and we did not teach him
how to talk to a girl?

36:04.294 --> 36:07.164
Sir, I assure you, we had no idea.

36:07.264 --> 36:11.222
- You're shy?
- Cody's a little delicate.

36:11.768 --> 36:14.671
My mother's ceramic cat
collection is delicate.

36:14.771 --> 36:17.763
- This is national security!
- I'm sorry.

36:20.110 --> 36:24.347
On the training program
you bragged about having lots of girls.

36:24.447 --> 36:28.474
It was camp. I exaggerated. Everyone does.

36:29.553 --> 36:31.721
...to Quad Seven. Agent Raymond...

36:31.821 --> 36:33.812
OK, so...

36:39.162 --> 36:41.494
What is the truth?

36:43.500 --> 36:46.594
When it comes to girls, I suck.

36:52.742 --> 36:56.580
You met my dad. Well, I'm his son.

36:56.680 --> 37:01.284
Ladies and gentlemen,
somebody has got to teach this kid

37:01.384 --> 37:03.375
how to talk to a girl!

37:04.321 --> 37:06.756
I understand you're having a problem,

37:06.856 --> 37:10.994
so I've assembled a team of experts
here to help you along

37:11.094 --> 37:14.197
from the point of contact
to the point of closure.

37:14.297 --> 37:15.899
You got to close.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.135
Any species is predicated upon mating.

37:18.235 --> 37:22.139
Males and females must couple
or the animal will surely die off.

37:22.239 --> 37:25.809
- I'm just trying to get a date.
- This is how the hyena does it...

37:25.909 --> 37:30.046
- See this thing here?
- There's a lot of laughing involved.

37:30.146 --> 37:35.118
It makes you wanna give the good Lord
a standing ovation.

37:35.218 --> 37:39.556
You gotta let her know she looks fresh.
Pay her compliments.

37:39.656 --> 37:42.159
Be smart. Get some dirt on her, eh?

37:42.259 --> 37:46.062
They use both sides of their brain
at once - emotion and intellect.

37:46.162 --> 37:49.432
- Check out previous boyfriends.
- Pick her up, don't be late.

37:49.532 --> 37:53.870
- It's a bad way to start off a first date.
- My grandfather used to say,

37:53.970 --> 37:58.308
"Women are like cow chips, the older they
get the easier they are to pick up."

37:58.408 --> 38:02.846
Let's take a few deep breaths
as we turn to the relationship pyramid...

38:02.946 --> 38:05.849
Forget all that,
you gotta be stern, commanding.

38:05.949 --> 38:10.320
- He's dead now.
- Shower before seeing the girl.

38:10.420 --> 38:14.257
No, no, you wanna be dank, dusky
and musky. She's got to smell you.

38:14.357 --> 38:17.627
My father was married 100 years or so.

38:17.727 --> 38:20.197
You gotta smell like a savage beast!

38:20.297 --> 38:23.433
Pull the ring in the back of his neck
and he goes, "My fault!"

38:23.533 --> 38:26.303
- Like a wild animal, the cheetah...
- Excuse me.

38:26.403 --> 38:31.007
If you find yourself in a difficult position,
hang on, fight it out!

38:31.107 --> 38:34.177
Hole up, get your energy back
for the final push!

38:34.277 --> 38:37.280
Think like a hyena, be a hyena.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.051
In the fog of war, it's the one
who wants it the most who wins.

38:41.151 --> 38:45.822
And I don't think you want it the most.
I think you are a pathetic loser.

38:45.922 --> 38:48.525
I think you're a disgrace.

38:48.625 --> 38:53.563
How are you gonna hold your head up
high when you walk down Main Street?

38:53.663 --> 38:57.334
- Straighten up when I talk to you.
- Thank you, General.

38:57.434 --> 39:00.801
I'm sorry this had to happen.
This one's gonna be good.

39:11.748 --> 39:14.084
Don't say I never did nothing for you.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.311
Look at that.

39:21.524 --> 39:23.219
Hey, Cody.

39:25.161 --> 39:27.397
Come over here.

39:27.497 --> 39:30.091
I'm free tonight, what shall we do?

39:42.979 --> 39:45.348
Kid can't even talk to a simulated woman.

39:45.448 --> 39:50.147
Maybe I should've started him out
at a more intermediate level.

39:58.795 --> 40:01.531
Wait, no, it's a little uneven.

40:01.631 --> 40:04.225
A little... Up more on the right.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.985
Are you OK?

40:22.085 --> 40:24.321
Where did you come from?

40:24.421 --> 40:26.946
I transferred from Jefferson High.

40:28.224 --> 40:31.294
This will help.
It'll make you feel better.

40:31.394 --> 40:33.863
Could you hold this, please?

40:33.963 --> 40:36.733
Nurse Hatchett
to the football field, please.

40:36.833 --> 40:38.994
I'll be right back, OK?

40:41.438 --> 40:43.599
You think it's broken?

40:47.844 --> 40:51.414
- Definitely not.
- So, you're a doctor now?

40:51.514 --> 40:55.785
Just experienced. I've broken my leg,
wrist, a couple of fingers...

40:55.885 --> 40:59.089
- Let me guess, driving accident?
- Summer camp.

40:59.189 --> 41:03.827
You know, one of those try and survive
the wilderness places. It's crazy.

41:03.927 --> 41:06.794
I've only be to one summer camp once.
It was for gymnastics.

41:07.363 --> 41:09.699
They never told me you took gymnastics.

41:09.799 --> 41:11.667
Who's they?

41:14.537 --> 41:17.062
OK, that's it. I have to do something.

41:20.910 --> 41:23.003
Sorry.

41:24.814 --> 41:28.079
So, you do gymnastics. That's awesome.

41:30.587 --> 41:32.680
Thank you for your help...

41:42.298 --> 41:45.635
You know, you make
a really bad first impression,

41:45.735 --> 41:47.937
and a terrible second impression

41:48.037 --> 41:50.206
but the third time?

41:50.306 --> 41:53.877
- It's really good.
- You gotta see my fourth.

41:53.977 --> 41:55.968
I'd like that.

41:59.115 --> 42:02.519
Listen, it's kind of short notice but...

42:02.619 --> 42:04.687
I'm having a party this weekend and...

42:04.787 --> 42:07.187
- I'd love to!
- Great.

42:10.426 --> 42:13.530
Hello, I'm substituting for Miss Hatchett,
are you all right?

42:13.630 --> 42:16.433
Yes, I'm fine,
I just need to go back to class.

42:16.533 --> 42:21.037
- Glad this young man saved you?
- We don't need any help, Nurse.

42:21.137 --> 42:23.573
I see here that your birthday
is coming up.

42:23.673 --> 42:26.369
That's none of your business, "Nurse".

42:27.477 --> 42:29.078
I'm gonna go.

42:29.178 --> 42:33.416
Are you having a party? You should
invite Cody. Did you invite him?

42:33.516 --> 42:35.711
- Yes, I did.
- You did?

42:37.420 --> 42:41.224
Cody, I'll see you on Sunday.
The theme is Las Vegas.

42:41.324 --> 42:43.758
All right, see you there.

42:51.267 --> 42:54.464
Not a word. Not a word.

42:56.105 --> 42:59.976
Be friendly but keep a low profile,
you're not there to socialize.

43:00.076 --> 43:04.113
E.R.I.S. May have inserted agents,
casino dealers, catering staff.

43:04.213 --> 43:05.840
Anyone is suspect.

43:07.817 --> 43:10.520
And remember: these are dangerous men.

43:10.620 --> 43:15.250
They'll think nothing of harming you.
So use caution.

43:16.326 --> 43:20.697
First floor of the house is a public area,
second floor is living space.

43:20.797 --> 43:23.333
Down on the beach
is Connors' personal lab.

43:23.433 --> 43:27.270
If you forget anything, the entire
floor plan is stored in your phone.

43:27.370 --> 43:29.906
We'll only be a couple of blocks away.

43:30.006 --> 43:31.906
Hold still.

43:32.942 --> 43:34.933
That really freaks me out.

43:35.979 --> 43:38.880
Sorry. Ready?

43:40.683 --> 43:43.379
Yeah. Let's go.

43:46.022 --> 43:48.183
Why don't you take it?

43:54.464 --> 43:56.955
- You did get him his license?
- Yeah.

44:14.951 --> 44:16.942
Here he comes.

44:22.558 --> 44:24.549
He's at the gate.

44:27.864 --> 44:30.967
- Name?
- Banks. Cody Banks.

44:31.067 --> 44:35.071
- You got some ID, Banks?
- You mean my driver's license?

44:35.171 --> 44:37.002
Yeah.

44:45.314 --> 44:48.647
There were no guns at my birthday party.

44:51.320 --> 44:53.311
- What's this?
- My cell phone.

44:55.291 --> 44:59.128
My MP3 player. You know
these stuffy parties, they get boring.

44:59.228 --> 45:01.093
Yeah, you have fun.

45:08.738 --> 45:10.433
He's in.

45:26.789 --> 45:29.781
We have to pass these out now.
I'm so over it.

45:32.228 --> 45:34.560
That's what I'm talkin' about!

45:41.871 --> 45:44.135
Guys, I'm 15, you know.

46:07.864 --> 46:09.855
I'll see you later.

46:19.008 --> 46:21.272
Sir? Another card for you.

46:23.179 --> 46:25.682
- How's your ankle?
- Much better.

46:25.782 --> 46:29.419
I better hold off
on the cartwheels for a while.

46:29.519 --> 46:32.321
- You don't want to have too much fun.
- No.

46:32.421 --> 46:35.458
Do you want something to drink
or anything?

46:35.558 --> 46:37.219
Happy birthday.

46:38.261 --> 46:39.592
Thank you.

46:43.332 --> 46:45.823
Wow, I love it, it's beautiful.

46:48.271 --> 46:50.739
- Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.

46:59.248 --> 47:01.217
Sorry.

47:01.317 --> 47:03.547
I'm kind of new at this.

47:10.827 --> 47:13.362
- Turquoise is my favorite.
- I know.

47:13.462 --> 47:16.454
- You're not supposed to know that.
- I know!

47:17.400 --> 47:19.168
What?

47:19.268 --> 47:21.862
Sorry, just this stupid voice in my head.

47:25.675 --> 47:27.610
I have to go play hostess.

47:27.710 --> 47:30.546
I'm not surprised
to see that you're the first...

47:30.646 --> 47:32.648
Don't ever interrupt me again!

47:32.748 --> 47:35.184
If you don't watch it,
you're going in next.

47:35.284 --> 47:38.082
- It won't happen again, I promise.
- Yeah, right.

47:38.855 --> 47:40.846
Place your bets.

47:45.261 --> 47:47.320
10,000. Red seven.

47:49.665 --> 47:52.602
10,000. Black 13.

47:52.702 --> 47:55.136
No more bets.

47:56.606 --> 47:58.597
Red seven.

48:01.110 --> 48:02.634
Thank you.

48:06.749 --> 48:08.740
Sir, it's just play money.

48:36.846 --> 48:38.837
Guys?

48:41.083 --> 48:42.710
Brinkman.

49:02.171 --> 49:04.435
This way, Mr. Brinkman.

49:19.155 --> 49:22.425
- Let's see what they're up to.
- Wait till it's clear.

49:22.525 --> 49:25.392
I'll be OK, I'm going down.

50:23.586 --> 50:28.114
- I'm on the roof of the lab.
- Be careful, it's full of motion sensors.

51:08.064 --> 51:11.659
I hope you haven't spent
all our money on real estate.

51:13.202 --> 51:15.805
Please don't touch anything.

51:15.905 --> 51:18.607
I'll give you a demonstration
in just a minute.

51:18.707 --> 51:21.677
Dr. Connors,
are you prepared to mass produce?

51:21.777 --> 51:26.415
Yes. But without freezing temperatures,
I can't control the nanobots.

51:26.515 --> 51:29.986
We'll supply you
with all the ice you'll ever need.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.388
Hey! No!

51:32.488 --> 51:35.358
This one cube, how many
nanobots are there?

51:35.458 --> 51:38.794
About 40,000
and soon as it starts to melt,

51:38.894 --> 51:41.030
they destroy everything in their path.

51:41.130 --> 51:43.257
Let's find out.

51:46.802 --> 51:48.929
See if they can eat this.

52:08.157 --> 52:10.284
That's fine.

52:18.701 --> 52:20.903
Temperature's rising, turning to liquid.

52:21.003 --> 52:24.962
- Thermo-containment disabled.
- Entering the chamber.

52:26.308 --> 52:28.970
The nanobots are ignoring the glass.

52:31.981 --> 52:35.251
They're programmed
to destroy only the metal.

52:35.351 --> 52:39.355
If you stick your finger in,
the temperature will confuse them

52:39.455 --> 52:42.185
and you'll lose it... painfully.

52:43.993 --> 52:48.327
- Look at those buggers go.
- They're like little Pac-Men.

52:50.966 --> 52:53.269
Say, what is that thing, by the way?

52:53.369 --> 52:57.740
A guidance system to a Russian S.S.18
intercontinental ballistic missile.

52:57.840 --> 53:02.511
- Are you getting this?
- The U.S. Uses similar components.

53:02.611 --> 53:04.647
Congratulations.

53:04.747 --> 53:09.480
You've given us the power to neutralize
America's entire strategic arsenal.

53:11.187 --> 53:13.485
And leave it defenseless.

53:16.192 --> 53:19.962
You'll never get the nanobots
into a military facility.

53:20.062 --> 53:23.031
- Yes we will.
- Wait a second.

53:23.165 --> 53:27.303
That wasn't the deal.
The deal was you finance the project,

53:27.403 --> 53:30.804
I decide what we do with the technology.

53:32.341 --> 53:37.938
You are going to program them
to march in like a column of ants.

53:40.115 --> 53:42.218
Now...

53:42.318 --> 53:44.616
shall we join your daughter?

53:48.857 --> 53:51.223
Thermo-containment engaged.

53:52.861 --> 53:54.988
System activated.

53:59.268 --> 54:03.432
- I think they're leaving.
- Get a sample of those nanobots.

54:14.617 --> 54:16.881
I'm going in.

55:15.144 --> 55:16.975
Bravo, Agent Banks.

55:20.316 --> 55:23.910
I've got one thing to say:
"Mission accomplished."

55:33.929 --> 55:36.955
The ice is melting.
They're eating my shoe.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.127
System alert. Zone two.

55:41.770 --> 55:43.539
What's that?

55:43.639 --> 55:47.439
- There's activity in the lab.
- What sort of activity?

55:51.180 --> 55:53.215
Get him back.

55:53.315 --> 55:56.318
The detectors are sensitive.
It's probably an insect.

55:56.418 --> 55:58.511
Or not. François.

56:06.962 --> 56:09.829
- Code, Doctor.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.859
Hurry up! Come on!

56:16.972 --> 56:19.202
Come on.

56:39.395 --> 56:41.386
Ducks.

56:42.531 --> 56:44.761
False alarm. All clear.

56:48.570 --> 56:51.334
- I wanted to buy a new car.
- All right. Oh.

56:53.008 --> 56:55.911
- What color is it?
- It's blue.

56:56.011 --> 56:59.081
Where did you steal that car from?
Can't be yours.

56:59.181 --> 57:01.250
Yeah, you can only afford one shoe.

57:01.350 --> 57:04.086
Guys, not right now. I'm really fried.

57:04.186 --> 57:07.323
Well, maybe we should
cool you off with a swim.

57:07.423 --> 57:09.024
That'll do it.

57:09.124 --> 57:12.795
- Guys, come on, it's not a good idea.
- Pick him up.

57:12.895 --> 57:15.798
- He's going in.
- Come on.

57:15.898 --> 57:18.093
We need to fix his tie.

57:44.226 --> 57:46.490
You're really starting to annoy me.

58:02.444 --> 58:04.912
He's in every single one of my classes.

58:12.888 --> 58:15.724
His moves are straight
out of the CIA handbook.

58:15.824 --> 58:18.952
I thought we got rid
of the CIA with Bolivar.

58:21.697 --> 58:23.732
Now they've sent a kid.

58:23.832 --> 58:28.437
Very impressive. Commence the E.R.I.S.
Child recruitment campaign immediately.

58:28.537 --> 58:31.340
I've never been so good with kids.

58:31.440 --> 58:36.207
I've noticed. We've gotta get out
of here immediately. Grab Connors.

58:37.946 --> 58:40.549
But I did a really good job.

58:40.649 --> 58:42.981
They can't pull me off this mission.

58:45.654 --> 58:50.353
Secret Agent Cody Banks.
You've made the school newspaper.

58:52.461 --> 58:55.760
I think it's safe to say
you've blown your cover.

58:56.899 --> 58:59.234
We'll take it from here.

58:59.334 --> 59:01.570
You'll stay at Donovan for two weeks

59:01.670 --> 59:04.540
and you will stay away
from Natalie Connors.

59:04.640 --> 59:07.543
I can't. I can't do that. She trusts me.

59:07.643 --> 59:09.745
You can and you will.

59:09.845 --> 59:12.681
It's your job. You knew that
when you picked this career.

59:12.781 --> 59:15.884
I didn't pick this career. It picked me.

59:15.984 --> 59:20.189
I subscribe to a few spy magazines
and surf the net for some cool sites.

59:20.289 --> 59:24.293
The next thing I know,
I'm at a CIA summer camp. I was 13.

59:24.393 --> 59:27.029
And now you're old enough
to know the rules.

59:27.129 --> 59:32.863
- Will the owner of the Aston Martin...?
- Here. This is for good luck.

59:34.670 --> 59:39.308
You might still be in danger.
We'll keep an eye on you.

59:39.408 --> 59:42.605
To keep me safe
or to keep me from Natalie?

01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:07.035
Dr. Connors, why is there a slowdown?

01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:10.138
We supply every piece
of equipment you ask for.

01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:14.176
You have absolutely,
unequivocally run out of excuses.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:17.079
- What's the problem?
- I will not use science

01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:19.340
to destroy the world.

01:00:20.115 --> 01:00:22.811
You pompous, know-all little nerd.

01:00:24.419 --> 01:00:28.219
François, I think he needs
a little motivation.

01:00:40.035 --> 01:00:42.162
I'll get it.

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:01.919
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Banks.
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:05.294
Nice to meet you, too.

01:01:05.394 --> 01:01:07.329
That was a girl.

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:08.997
A hot girl.

01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:11.700
Here you go. Two pistachios.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.631
Thanks.

01:01:16.972 --> 01:01:20.509
I can not believe that you like
pistachio ice cream.

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:22.907
We have so much in common.

01:01:23.445 --> 01:01:27.749
So, tell me again why
we had to sneak out the back door.

01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:31.046
Natalie, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:34.256
You don't have to say anything.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.551
- I know.
- You do?

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:39.354
Yeah. And...

01:01:40.328 --> 01:01:43.098
I think I feel the same way, too.

01:01:43.198 --> 01:01:45.567
Oh, man.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:47.760
I'm not the person you...

01:01:50.338 --> 01:01:52.329
Eat your burger.

01:01:55.877 --> 01:01:57.813
Come on!

01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:59.881
You little runt!

01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:10.152
What is going on here?

01:02:13.061 --> 01:02:14.997
Get out of the way.

01:02:15.097 --> 01:02:18.362
Your dad got involved
with some nasty people.

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:26.074
Stop it!

01:02:26.174 --> 01:02:28.233
Take care of him.

01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:40.086
Get... in... the...

01:02:41.523 --> 01:02:44.788
Get in the car.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.260
Wake up.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.419
Hello.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.900
They took Natalie.
She's been kidnapped. She's gone.

01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:33.603
Should have stayed away from her.

01:03:34.075 --> 01:03:37.112
Don't worry, OK? We're gonna get her back.

01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:39.548
Let me help.

01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:41.980
The Director issued explicit orders.

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:53.995
- So what happens to me?
- Just go to school.

01:03:54.095 --> 01:03:58.054
Hang out with your friends,
do your homework. Be a kid.

01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:04.127
- See you later, man.
- It was good working with you.

01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:09.038
See you later, kid.

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.449
See you.

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:42.404
Are you OK? Where have you been?
What happened?

01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:49.951
Did that girl do this to you?

01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:53.488
That would be the bullies we ran into.
It's no big deal.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:55.857
- And you protected her?
- Kinda.

01:04:55.957 --> 01:04:59.027
- What were you doing out so late?
- We just talked.

01:04:59.127 --> 01:05:02.063
So you're OK? Are you sure?

01:05:02.163 --> 01:05:04.199
In that case, you are so grounded.

01:05:04.299 --> 01:05:06.631
Do you have any idea what time it is?

01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:11.936
Go to your room.

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:17.069
I'm in the fire level, where are you?

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.549
- Alex.
- I gotta go.

01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:23.418
I told you not to touch my stuff.
Give me all that.

01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:25.620
It's just a Game Boy.
I know what I'm doing.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.281
This stuff is special.
So is the phone. Give it to me.

01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:35.063
If you wanna disable the surveillance lock,
press pound one five.

01:05:35.163 --> 01:05:37.232
If you wanna return to the main menu...

01:05:37.332 --> 01:05:39.568
- Who's he?
- A guy from the phone company.

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:41.603
What guy from the phone company?

01:05:41.703 --> 01:05:43.705
A guy that works for the phone company.

01:05:43.805 --> 01:05:46.899
You think I'm stupid?
What's going on here?

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.645
Fine.

01:05:50.745 --> 01:05:53.648
I'm a junior secret agent
working for the CIA.

01:05:53.748 --> 01:05:55.784
They gave me this stuff. Happy?

01:05:55.884 --> 01:05:57.943
Whatever.

01:05:59.688 --> 01:06:01.690
- What's this?
- I don't know.

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:05.556
It's been doing that
for a couple of hours.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.998
- Turquoise is my favorite.
- I know.

01:06:19.107 --> 01:06:21.337
She still has the micro-sensor.

01:06:24.045 --> 01:06:26.377
She's in the Cascade Mountains.

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:32.120
Please, the Director's gotta talk to me.
This is important.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.689
- He's not available.
- What about Ronica Miles?

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:37.359
- She is not available.
- Can you track her down?

01:06:37.459 --> 01:06:40.362
- I'm sorry, Mr. Banks.
- Will anybody take my call?

01:06:40.462 --> 01:06:42.555
Sorry, Banks.

01:06:43.798 --> 01:06:47.131
- I have to go.
- You can't leave. You're grounded.

01:06:49.404 --> 01:06:55.070
Alex, how would you like
to become a junior junior agent?

01:06:56.578 --> 01:06:58.239
What's in it for me?

01:07:17.732 --> 01:07:21.168
- Hey, Rosychuk, open the doors.
- Er, yeah.

01:07:22.137 --> 01:07:24.572
You don't need to see a badge or anything?

01:07:24.672 --> 01:07:27.266
- Not from you.
- Didn't think so.

01:07:59.007 --> 01:08:01.109
I'm worried about Cody.

01:08:01.209 --> 01:08:03.678
- What.
- We haven't heard a peep out of him.

01:08:03.778 --> 01:08:06.440
- Who?
- Maybe I was a little hard on him.

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:10.907
- I think I'm gonna go check on him.
- Alex, go to bed.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.537
- You all right?
- I guess.

01:08:34.975 --> 01:08:38.002
- You gonna stay in here all night?
- I guess.

01:08:40.247 --> 01:08:43.183
- All right. Are you mad at me and Dad?
- I guess.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:46.182
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:50.358
Are you gonna disobey us again
and stay out past your curfew?

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.585
I guess.

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:55.960
Just kidding.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.059
All right, then.

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.997
Good night.

01:09:39.674 --> 01:09:41.904
I need to get to Red Face.

01:10:21.115 --> 01:10:24.352
- He stole the car?
- And a few other items, sir.

01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.721
He's gone after Connors' daughter.

01:10:26.821 --> 01:10:29.757
- You have to admire his perseverance.
- No, I don't.

01:10:29.857 --> 01:10:32.760
Resisting orders,
stealing government property.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:36.664
My summer camp wasn't training
operatives, it was training hoodlums.

01:10:36.764 --> 01:10:39.892
This is your fault. You find that punk.

01:10:41.035 --> 01:10:43.299
Or I'm gonna have your job.

01:10:44.472 --> 01:10:47.908
- Who let him in here, anyway?
- Er, me, Rosychuk.

01:12:40.555 --> 01:12:43.080
Stop. You have entered a restricted area.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:53.824
Stop.

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:19.089
You are inside a restricted area.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.393
Stop or you will be intercepted.

01:14:14.882 --> 01:14:18.010
- Need any help?
- No, I'm fine.

01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:41.809
How'd you find me? I threw away
that transceiver you put on me.

01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:43.511
That wasn't a transceiver,

01:14:43.611 --> 01:14:47.348
that was an 18-carat gold pin
that my mentor gave to me.

01:14:47.448 --> 01:14:48.716
Sorry.

01:14:48.816 --> 01:14:54.448
Don't you think the CIA has Lojack on
its stuff? Even that board has one.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.835
What are you doing?

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:10.096
What do you think? I'm getting the board.

01:15:11.105 --> 01:15:13.708
You can hop on with me instead.

01:15:13.808 --> 01:15:17.938
Listen, I'm not going back with you.
I'm here to rescue Natalie.

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.572
Me, too.

01:16:11.232 --> 01:16:12.859
There.

01:16:31.519 --> 01:16:33.953
Stand clear of the doors.

01:16:35.389 --> 01:16:38.626
Warning. Doors closing.

01:16:38.726 --> 01:16:41.354
Stand clear of the doors.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.300
Warning. Doors closing.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.925
Stand clear of the doors.

01:16:50.638 --> 01:16:52.003
Warning.

01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:56.766
Everything's locked.

01:16:58.079 --> 01:17:01.776
Group five to Yellow Sector Zebra Niner.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:06.849
Group five to Yellow Sector Zebra Niner.

01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:14.758
- Everything OK?
- Sir.

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:53.434
So that's how they're doing it,
the ice cubes.

01:17:53.534 --> 01:17:56.128
That's how they plan
to distribute the nanobots.

01:17:56.737 --> 01:18:00.229
Everyone uses ice cubes.
No one will know what hit them.

01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:13.250
So difficult to get good sushi
in the mountains.

01:18:14.055 --> 01:18:16.387
- How's the girl?
- She's trouble.

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:21.423
She's 15 years old,
how much trouble can she be?

01:18:35.142 --> 01:18:37.133
Go.

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:47.185
Blue team to Sector One-Four.

01:18:50.324 --> 01:18:52.519
- Check.
- Check.

01:18:57.898 --> 01:18:59.867
Oh, my God! They got you too.

01:18:59.967 --> 01:19:03.004
- No, I'm here on my own.
- What are you doing here?

01:19:03.104 --> 01:19:05.172
Let's discuss it over some ice cream.

01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:07.508
I'm not moving till
I know what's going on.

01:19:07.608 --> 01:19:10.044
I'll tell you later. Let's go.

01:19:10.144 --> 01:19:13.375
Last time I went out with you,
it didn't go so well.

01:19:15.883 --> 01:19:17.852
Group five to Yellow Sector...

01:19:17.952 --> 01:19:20.546
Boss, take a look at this.

01:19:23.057 --> 01:19:25.048
It's that kid again.

01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:35.469
Go get him.

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:38.472
- Guys, listen up.
- It must be love.

01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:42.406
- You're not gonna propose to me?
- No, I'm hiding from the camera.

01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:50.379
Look. I work for the CIA.

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:53.447
- Yeah, right!
- No, really, I'm serious.

01:19:53.554 --> 01:19:55.656
I'm part of this
Agent Development Program.

01:19:55.756 --> 01:19:58.426
Getting to you was my first assignment.

01:19:58.526 --> 01:20:02.292
- Why did you need to get to me?
- To get to your dad.

01:20:04.999 --> 01:20:07.092
Great. So...

01:20:09.203 --> 01:20:11.194
So you just used me?

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:21.649
I cannot believe what an idiot I am!

01:20:21.749 --> 01:20:24.217
Cody, I thought you were different.

01:20:36.797 --> 01:20:38.733
Listen.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:41.461
In the beginning it was just my assignment

01:20:42.536 --> 01:20:44.527
but towards the end they...

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.631
They what?

01:20:50.144 --> 01:20:52.305
They pulled me off the job.

01:20:53.948 --> 01:20:55.677
Why?

01:20:57.351 --> 01:20:59.842
They pulled me off the job because...

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:04.722
I was getting too emotionally
attached to the subject.

01:21:07.661 --> 01:21:10.095
We gotta go. Now.

01:21:11.298 --> 01:21:14.756
Cody, what is the school nurse doing here?

01:21:15.603 --> 01:21:19.273
- I was gonna tell you but...
- Hello. Ronica Miles, CIA.

01:21:19.373 --> 01:21:21.108
Let's go.

01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:22.977
- We gotta go!
- Let's go.

01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:25.068
Sorry.

01:21:29.216 --> 01:21:31.719
Hi, fellas. We were just...

01:21:31.819 --> 01:21:34.049
leaving!

01:21:36.357 --> 01:21:38.382
All right, let's go.

01:21:38.926 --> 01:21:40.917
Come on.

01:21:48.602 --> 01:21:50.797
Go get them!

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.403
Go, go, go!

01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:57.200
Get her.

01:22:05.853 --> 01:22:08.155
T minus three hours

01:22:08.255 --> 01:22:10.416
until distribution sequence.

01:22:11.992 --> 01:22:14.662
T minus three hours

01:22:14.762 --> 01:22:17.230
until distribution sequence.

01:22:21.468 --> 01:22:24.562
Don't tell me. CIA, right?

01:22:25.873 --> 01:22:27.864
Love that suit.

01:22:28.575 --> 01:22:30.277
No place for a gun in there.

01:22:30.377 --> 01:22:32.402
Where is my dad?

01:22:34.214 --> 01:22:35.943
I'm not going to tell you.

01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:40.821
Where's little lover boy?

01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:43.123
He can't get out. We'll find him.

01:22:43.223 --> 01:22:45.282
Bring Connors up.

01:22:48.128 --> 01:22:49.930
Central

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:51.699
Intelligence

01:22:51.799 --> 01:22:53.391
Agency.

01:22:55.636 --> 01:22:57.627
Just in time.

01:22:59.773 --> 01:23:03.504
Tag team to Quadrant C, cargo pods.

01:23:05.245 --> 01:23:08.737
Tag team to Quadrant C, cargo pods.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.923
- Dad!
- Dr. Connors.

01:23:16.023 --> 01:23:20.094
I'm going to place this ice cube,
containing thousands of nanobots,

01:23:20.194 --> 01:23:22.630
on your daughter's forehead.

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:25.900
Program the nanobots
to obey that remote control.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.668
If you don't,

01:23:27.768 --> 01:23:31.005
her body temperature
will cause the ice to melt,

01:23:31.105 --> 01:23:34.708
releasing the nanobots which
will then eat away indiscriminately.

01:23:34.808 --> 01:23:36.969
Dad, don't do it.

01:23:38.579 --> 01:23:40.781
All right, I'll do it. Just let her go.

01:23:40.881 --> 01:23:44.385
Program the remote
and that's exactly what I'll do.

01:23:44.485 --> 01:23:47.181
All right. Stay calm, Natalie.

01:23:52.626 --> 01:23:55.527
Look at the water
on your daughter's forehead.

01:23:55.963 --> 01:23:59.694
I can't do it this quick,
it's a complicated process.

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.869
Ice is melting.

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:03.698
Give it up, Brinkman.

01:24:04.204 --> 01:24:06.434
Let her go.

01:24:06.874 --> 01:24:10.411
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I'll blow this place up.

01:24:10.511 --> 01:24:12.672
Let Natalie go.

01:24:21.321 --> 01:24:23.057
No.

01:24:23.157 --> 01:24:25.352
Cody, do it.

01:24:43.577 --> 01:24:45.568
Come on, let's go.

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.422
Go, go, go!

01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:22.016
François, get the remote!

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:24.418
Stop them, François. Stop them!

01:25:24.518 --> 01:25:26.509
It's not gonna work.

01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:30.746
Do it!

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.685
Boss!

01:26:08.095 --> 01:26:10.893
I can't stop them!
I don't know what to do.

01:26:27.648 --> 01:26:29.116
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

01:26:29.216 --> 01:26:30.818
Are you all right?

01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:32.909
Let's go, come on.

01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:36.590
Let's go.

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:38.681
Cody, come on.

01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:42.062
Warning. Nanobot containment breach.

01:26:42.162 --> 01:26:45.732
Please proceed to
the nearest evacuation tunnel.

01:26:45.832 --> 01:26:48.836
Warning. Nanobot containment breach.

01:26:48.936 --> 01:26:52.394
Please proceed to
the nearest evacuation tunnel.

01:26:56.677 --> 01:26:58.269
Dad!

01:27:00.547 --> 01:27:02.449
- Meet us at the chopper.
- Dad!

01:27:02.549 --> 01:27:05.085
Be careful. Come on.

01:27:05.185 --> 01:27:06.914
Come on.

01:27:16.029 --> 01:27:17.360
Come on.

01:27:31.211 --> 01:27:33.270
Go!

01:27:37.784 --> 01:27:40.487
- Get in.
- Nanobot containment breach.

01:27:40.587 --> 01:27:44.148
Please proceed to
the nearest evacuation tunnel.

01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:59.139
- I don't see them.
- They'll be here.

01:27:59.239 --> 01:28:01.730
I do not see them. Where are they?

01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:10.411
Duck.

01:28:10.984 --> 01:28:13.043
There they are.

01:28:22.796 --> 01:28:24.531
Thank God.

01:28:24.631 --> 01:28:26.963
- Come on, we got to go.
- Get in.

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:49.412
They're jammed.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.351
Come on!

01:28:59.966 --> 01:29:02.298
Go! Lift off.

01:29:05.272 --> 01:29:09.038
- What is he doing?
- He's finding a way to open the doors.

01:29:30.597 --> 01:29:32.827
Oh, my God.

01:29:34.634 --> 01:29:37.804
Why don't you land
so we can make a run for it?

01:29:37.904 --> 01:29:41.362
In case you hadn't noticed,
there is no place to land.

01:30:05.799 --> 01:30:08.495
Go! The doors! Go!

01:30:10.637 --> 01:30:12.298
Here we go.

01:30:54.948 --> 01:30:57.246
You messed up my haircut. See?

01:30:58.718 --> 01:31:00.709
See?

01:31:18.505 --> 01:31:21.872
Come here. Come here!

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.625
- Go, go, go!
- I know, I know!

01:33:04.177 --> 01:33:07.247
- Sorry about your hair.
- Yeah?

01:33:07.347 --> 01:33:10.009
Not as sorry as you're going to be.

01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:19.626
- How's your family?
- A little worried.

01:33:19.726 --> 01:33:20.927
Really?

01:33:21.027 --> 01:33:25.054
They want me to go to public school.
You know, it's "safer".

01:33:26.533 --> 01:33:28.763
Sorry. I know that freaks you out.

01:33:29.803 --> 01:33:31.794
It's OK. You're my handler.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.131
Partner.

01:33:48.388 --> 01:33:51.357
- Congratulations.
- Good job, son.

01:33:54.728 --> 01:33:56.719
Come here, you big lug!

01:34:07.273 --> 01:34:09.264
Nicely done, kid.

01:34:20.587 --> 01:34:22.578
You're the man.

01:34:37.303 --> 01:34:39.239
Well done, Banks.

01:34:39.339 --> 01:34:41.637
The country's proud of you.

01:34:42.308 --> 01:34:47.075
If there's ever anything we can do
for you, anything at all.

01:34:51.384 --> 01:34:53.620
Well, there is one thing.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.425
I cannot believe that
I got my driver's license! And so fast.

01:34:58.525 --> 01:35:00.857
- It's kinda weird.
- So weird.

01:35:02.896 --> 01:35:04.898
Come on, calm down.

01:35:04.998 --> 01:35:07.125
The road. We're going...

01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:20.102
It's so beautiful out here.

01:35:21.481 --> 01:35:23.472
Just like you.

01:35:32.025 --> 01:35:35.895
- Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn.
- Not now!

01:35:35.995 --> 01:35:39.658
Cody, do not turn me off.
I need to speak to you.

01:35:41.234 --> 01:35:43.259
Turn me around this instant.

01:35:45.171 --> 01:35:46.940
Now, what was my mission?

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.372
I think you were about to kiss me.
