DON QUIXOTE (VOICEOVER): I
was born by the special will

01:07.339 --> 01:11.938
of heaven in this Age
of Iron to restore

01:11.940 --> 01:16.504
the lost age of chivalry.

There!

02:00.905 --> 02:04.237
With arms six miles long...

02:04.239 --> 02:08.270
just facing his
terrible, grinding teeth.

02:08.273 --> 02:13.703
I am sworn to rid the earth of
this foul and fearsome giant,

03:47.705 --> 03:49.970
Because the whole
concept is ridiculous.

03:49.972 --> 03:52.537
Because we become
what we hold on to.

38:01.469 --> 38:02.468
God no!

38:02.470 --> 38:03.771
(GUNFIRE)

38:05.470 --> 38:08.902
Sancho, the forces of
darkness are defeated!

38:08.904 --> 38:10.505
It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

38:15.971 --> 38:17.471
Fuck.
Shit.

38:29.504 --> 38:30.905
(PANTING)

38:44.404 --> 38:45.605
(FRANTIC) I'm bleeding.

38:48.436 --> 38:50.302
Oh.
Oh.

38:50.304 --> 38:51.435
Thank God it's not mine.

38:51.437 --> 38:53.638
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

38:55.670 --> 38:57.969
No, no, no.

38:57.971 --> 38:59.702
Fuck.

38:59.704 --> 39:00.734
No!

39:00.736 --> 39:01.837
Please don't let this be real!

39:07.470 --> 39:10.338
Fuck!
Fuck!

39:22.737 --> 39:25.401
Oh shit.
Shit.

39:25.403 --> 39:26.367
Shit.
Shit.

39:26.369 --> 39:26.902
Shit.

39:26.904 --> 39:29.734
(ECHOES)

39:29.736 --> 39:30.704
Fucking batteries!

39:35.503 --> 39:37.302
I'm a dead man.
OK.

39:37.304 --> 39:37.936
OK.

39:37.938 --> 39:39.401
Take control.

39:39.403 --> 39:42.235
Take control, Toby.

39:42.237 --> 39:44.367
Take control and the
world soon follows.

39:44.369 --> 39:45.901
Take control and the
world soon follows.

39:45.903 --> 39:46.538
Take control.

39:55.637 --> 39:56.935
Sancho!

39:56.937 --> 39:58.734
There you are.

39:58.736 --> 40:03.535
You crazy peasant,
always playing games.

40:03.537 --> 40:05.602
Do you think you
can hide from me?

40:05.604 --> 40:06.534
No, no, no, no, no.

40:06.536 --> 40:07.435
Stay away from me.

40:07.437 --> 40:09.268
Sancho, you're free.

40:09.270 --> 40:10.602
Those cops are
dead, aren't they?

40:10.604 --> 40:12.968
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.601
The forces of darkness
can never die.

40:15.603 --> 40:16.935
You killed them, didn't you?

40:16.937 --> 40:19.568
You were so brave, huh?

40:19.570 --> 40:21.635
The way you attacked
that coachman

40:21.637 --> 40:24.202
and frightened away
his wailing beast.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.401
I didn't do anything.

40:25.403 --> 40:28.334
Oh, humility is a blessing.

40:28.336 --> 40:30.804
Tonight, we will sing
songs to your bravery.

40:35.536 --> 40:38.634
I brought you your
clothes, Sancho.

40:38.636 --> 40:41.368
You can get out of
that disguise, eh?

40:41.370 --> 40:43.238
(LAUGHS) You are free.

40:45.904 --> 40:48.235
Oh, Sancho.

40:48.237 --> 40:52.401
We shall have such great
adventures together.

40:52.403 --> 40:55.901
A knight-errant and
his loyal squire, huh?

40:55.903 --> 40:57.869
Mwah.
Mwah.

40:57.871 --> 40:58.871
Sancho.

41:10.970 --> 41:13.202
This will be a marvelous
day for adventure, Sancho.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.902
I feel it in my bones.

41:14.904 --> 41:18.335
I need to call my office.

41:18.337 --> 41:19.734
Where are we going?

41:19.736 --> 41:22.235
Who knows?

41:22.237 --> 41:25.768
Her destiny guides
our fortune, Sancho.

41:25.770 --> 41:29.170
(FLIES BUZZING)

41:30.604 --> 41:33.534
I'm getting eaten alive.

41:33.536 --> 41:34.634
Look, maybe we
should just go back

41:34.636 --> 41:37.267
and face a few ugly realities.

41:37.269 --> 41:38.701
You can explain everything
to the authorities.

41:38.703 --> 41:39.968
Explain?

41:39.970 --> 41:42.936
Do you think explaining
explains anything?

41:42.938 --> 41:45.534
Well, yes.

41:45.536 --> 41:48.901
You have a simple view of
life, Sancho, very touching.

41:48.903 --> 41:49.936
Yeah.

41:49.938 --> 41:51.367
And you're really Don Quixote.

41:51.369 --> 41:51.871
You doubt it?

41:55.804 --> 41:58.768
Look, do you remember years
ago, about 10 years ago,

41:58.770 --> 42:00.302
I was making a film?

42:00.304 --> 42:02.936
You were just an
old man I found.

42:02.938 --> 42:06.901
- I was lost, forgotten.
- Yeah, right.

42:06.903 --> 42:08.435
But then I found you.

42:08.437 --> 42:10.334
And I thought, this guy
has an interesting face.

42:10.336 --> 42:13.302
It's the kind of face I'd
use now to sell insurance.

42:13.304 --> 42:16.302
I owe you a
great debt, Sancho.

42:16.304 --> 42:17.501
You restored me.

42:17.503 --> 42:19.334
You really don't remember?

42:19.336 --> 42:22.601
(DRAMATIC VOICE) Don Quixote
de la Mancha, the knight

42:22.603 --> 42:24.267
of the mournful countenance...

42:24.269 --> 42:27.701
Come to restore the
lost age of chivalry

42:27.703 --> 42:30.768
by a special will of heaven!

42:30.770 --> 42:32.268
Yes.

42:32.270 --> 42:34.234
Well, I wrote that.

42:34.236 --> 42:35.535
Que?

42:35.537 --> 42:36.902
I adapted it, since
a screenplay is a very

42:36.904 --> 42:38.235
different language to a novel.

42:38.237 --> 42:38.701
But it's...

42:38.703 --> 42:40.570
(GRUNTS)

42:44.570 --> 42:45.936
Blasphemer!

42:45.938 --> 42:48.734
The hand of our God
in heaven wrote me,

42:48.736 --> 42:51.635
- not the filthy whore of some...
- OK.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.202
OK.
I apologize.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.768
I'm sorry.

42:54.770 --> 42:58.534
You may beg forgiveness at
the feet of my Lady Dulcinea.

42:58.536 --> 42:59.634
Lady Dulcinea, right?

42:59.636 --> 43:00.302
Of course.

43:00.304 --> 43:02.401
OK.

43:02.403 --> 43:06.935
Once, as if in a
dream, Don Quixote

43:06.937 --> 43:11.869
dreams this Lady Dulcinea.

43:11.871 --> 43:14.402
She was sitting...

43:14.404 --> 43:17.267
Beside a stream before
her crystal mansion.

43:17.269 --> 43:19.535
I know, of course.

43:19.537 --> 43:21.201
Writing again, Sancho?

43:21.203 --> 43:21.701
No.

43:21.703 --> 43:23.435
No.

43:23.437 --> 43:26.801
Because those are the words
of the great Arab historian,

43:26.803 --> 43:28.268
Cide Hamete Benengeli.

43:28.270 --> 43:31.302
Right, right, I forgot.

43:31.304 --> 43:38.304
I have here this rare
volume of my exploits, hmm?

43:39.437 --> 43:43.902
A trifle florid perhaps,
but the spirit is true.

43:43.904 --> 43:46.334
Can I read?

43:46.336 --> 43:49.137
(LAUGHTER)

43:50.603 --> 43:53.234
That a peasant like
you should feign interest

43:53.236 --> 43:54.638
in a book he cannot read.

43:57.571 --> 44:00.401
Can I see?

44:00.403 --> 44:00.967
Oh.

44:00.969 --> 44:02.868
But I can read.

44:02.870 --> 44:06.468
This is English, Sancho.

44:06.470 --> 44:08.701
"Eeeen-gleesh."

44:08.703 --> 44:14.534
It's a very difficult language,
a Protestant language.

44:14.536 --> 44:15.834
But come.
Come.

44:15.836 --> 44:20.468
Come.
Sit with me, huh?

44:20.470 --> 44:21.671
We will read it together.

44:24.537 --> 44:27.769
Now, I will sound the words.

44:27.771 --> 44:31.669
And you can look
at the pictures.

44:31.671 --> 44:34.869
Now, here.

44:34.871 --> 44:41.871
Here, this is me on my
war horse, Rocinante.

44:44.236 --> 44:46.335
That's you Sancho.

44:46.337 --> 44:50.235
And here... here...

44:50.237 --> 44:54.668
(SIGHS) here is a
beautiful princess, hmm,

44:54.670 --> 44:57.601
resplendent on her charger.

44:57.603 --> 44:59.871
(BELL RINGS)

45:11.836 --> 45:13.967
A giant!

45:13.969 --> 45:15.934
What giant?

45:15.936 --> 45:20.669
A giant with arms
six miles long.

45:20.671 --> 45:22.502
She is in terrible danger.

45:22.504 --> 45:23.467
It's a windmill.

45:23.469 --> 45:24.768
Oh!

45:24.770 --> 45:25.601

Don!

45:35.404 --> 45:36.702
This is a mistake!

45:36.704 --> 45:38.401
Prepare to die, foul
and fearsome beast!

45:38.403 --> 45:39.268
This isn't a giant!

45:39.270 --> 45:40.535
Oh, god no!
Don!

45:40.537 --> 45:41.901
Don!

45:41.903 --> 45:44.337
(GROANS) Take this!

45:49.736 --> 45:52.635
And cut right there.

45:52.637 --> 45:53.535
Oh.

45:53.537 --> 45:56.235
Giant, where are you?

45:56.237 --> 45:59.434
Where are you, huh?

45:59.436 --> 46:02.801
There you are, you thief!

46:02.803 --> 46:04.270
Take that!

46:07.269 --> 46:08.601
(GROANS)

46:08.603 --> 46:10.534
Hey!

46:10.536 --> 46:12.769
- Ow.
- Don't move.

46:12.771 --> 46:15.534
Just lay still.

46:15.536 --> 46:18.934
You have saved, dear lady.

46:18.936 --> 46:22.701
I am at your command.

46:22.703 --> 46:23.338
Oh.

46:26.237 --> 46:28.467
I see the love
light in your eyes.

46:28.469 --> 46:31.669
It's understandable.

46:31.671 --> 46:33.800
My hand on it.

46:33.802 --> 46:38.535
But alas, I am
betrothed to another.

46:38.537 --> 46:40.833
Oh.

46:40.835 --> 46:42.368
Oh.

46:42.370 --> 46:45.334
Does he have the
squirrels in the attic?

46:45.336 --> 46:48.302
Squirrels are the least of it.

46:48.304 --> 46:50.302
Do you have a phone I could use?

46:50.304 --> 46:52.601
My father will help you.

46:52.603 --> 46:54.434
Is he a builder?
Or?

46:54.436 --> 46:57.735
It's all very, uh, rustic.

46:57.737 --> 46:58.934
No, se or.

46:58.936 --> 47:01.302
This is oil.

47:01.304 --> 47:04.201
Oil is working,
just squeaky clean.

47:04.203 --> 47:05.768
What?

47:05.770 --> 47:06.634
Not rustic.

47:06.636 --> 47:09.368
Not rustic.

47:09.370 --> 47:10.935
Oh, the bike?
Yeah.

47:10.937 --> 47:12.935
No, it's all very oiled.

47:12.937 --> 47:14.401
Everything's very oily.

47:14.403 --> 47:15.435
Yes.

47:15.437 --> 47:16.301
You can't have too much oil.

47:16.303 --> 47:18.737
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

47:23.304 --> 47:23.967
Wait, wait, wait.

47:23.969 --> 47:25.435
Wha... you live here?

47:25.437 --> 47:26.734
- Live?
- Yeah.

47:26.736 --> 47:28.601
This is... this is
where you live?

47:28.603 --> 47:30.467
I live here.

47:30.469 --> 47:32.235
I die here.

47:32.237 --> 47:32.833
Right, it's good.

47:32.835 --> 47:34.468
That's good.

47:34.470 --> 47:35.668
I live.

47:35.670 --> 47:37.268
I die.

47:37.270 --> 47:38.468
I live.

47:38.470 --> 47:39.768
I die.

47:39.770 --> 47:40.767
I live.

47:40.769 --> 47:42.502
- Live and die.
- I live.

47:42.504 --> 47:43.800
I die.

47:43.802 --> 47:47.900
(COUGHING) Some of us...

47:47.902 --> 47:49.137
some of us sooner than others.

48:01.470 --> 48:03.267
What do you think
you are doing, huh?

48:03.269 --> 48:04.700
Get them out of here!

48:04.702 --> 48:08.235
What is this splendid
castle that defies gravity?

48:08.237 --> 48:09.201
Hello.

48:09.203 --> 48:10.635
Can I use your telephone?

48:10.637 --> 48:15.501
And this angelic messenger
who welcomes us as she...

48:15.503 --> 48:16.403
We don't want any trouble.

48:18.970 --> 48:24.601
Divine lady, I shall
forever preserve your kindness

48:24.603 --> 48:27.502
in the treasury of my memory.

48:27.504 --> 48:28.734
Oh.

48:28.736 --> 48:29.901
Get him out of here.

48:29.903 --> 48:31.467
Come on.

48:31.469 --> 48:33.235
Please, please, my
dear, this is not showing

48:33.237 --> 48:34.833
what good Christians we are.

48:34.835 --> 48:37.701
Remember, this is the Holy Week.

48:37.703 --> 48:42.467
Oh, oh, oh, this old
man must be playing

48:42.469 --> 48:43.833
the part of a martyred saint.

48:43.835 --> 48:46.768
Look, his halo.

48:46.770 --> 48:47.668
So devout.

48:47.670 --> 48:48.801
Is there a telephone?

48:48.803 --> 48:49.700
Elephant?

48:49.702 --> 48:50.535
What elephant?

48:50.537 --> 48:51.302
OK.

48:51.304 --> 48:52.468
I'm going to go.

48:52.470 --> 48:53.367
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

48:53.369 --> 48:54.401
You must stay.

48:54.403 --> 48:55.635
You must stay.

48:55.637 --> 48:58.368
Out there is very
dangerous, bad men.

48:58.370 --> 49:01.401
But here, everything is A-OK.

49:01.403 --> 49:04.601
Here, we are all
the good Samaritans.

49:04.603 --> 49:08.935
We will turn the other cheek
to hear your brave martyr.

49:08.937 --> 49:11.402
We must charm these
needy pilgrims.

49:11.404 --> 49:13.968
A good host looks
after his hostages.

49:13.970 --> 49:15.235
Is that the right word?

49:15.237 --> 49:18.569
No, that's not the right word.

49:18.571 --> 49:20.836
(FLUTTERING)

49:26.537 --> 49:28.737
Rest here, brave holy martyr.

49:31.503 --> 49:32.303
We'll be back soon.

49:41.902 --> 49:44.501
Why must I be such
an unfortunate knight?

49:44.503 --> 49:45.767
What have you got me into?

49:45.769 --> 49:48.267
Young ladies just
have to look at me once

49:48.269 --> 49:50.634
to be swept away with love.

49:50.636 --> 49:51.271
I abhor you.

50:01.969 --> 50:06.567
Why must my matchless
devotion to my Lady Dulcinea

50:06.569 --> 50:08.401
always be tested?

50:08.403 --> 50:11.634

01:02:40.901 --> 01:02:42.800
Things didn't work out?

01:02:42.802 --> 01:02:49.534
Modeling, mostly escort work.

01:02:49.536 --> 01:02:53.534
Isn't it beautiful here?

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:58.601
It's my favorite place on earth.

01:02:58.603 --> 01:03:03.533
My father would bring
me here on my birthdays.

01:03:03.535 --> 01:03:09.201
He said the cave was a
secret entrance to heaven

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:10.500
for all the poor people.

01:03:10.502 --> 01:03:11.899
And in the waterfall
was an angel.

01:03:11.901 --> 01:03:13.236
I fucked things up
for you, didn't I?

01:03:15.802 --> 01:03:18.400
Don't flatter yourself.

01:03:18.402 --> 01:03:20.302
You think I wanted to
do laundry all my life?

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.667
I'm doing OK now.

01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:30.533
Life's good.

01:03:30.535 --> 01:03:33.302
But someone special in my life...

01:03:36.369 --> 01:03:37.170
Someone who does this.

01:03:39.835 --> 01:03:41.703
- Comes with the territory.
- OK.

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:45.333
Sorry.

01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:47.300
Why?

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:48.734
It's a living.

01:03:48.736 --> 01:03:49.633
Same as you.

01:03:49.635 --> 01:03:50.500
I don't get beaten up.

01:03:50.502 --> 01:03:51.733
(THWACK) Ow!

01:03:51.735 --> 01:03:52.433
Fuck!

01:03:52.435 --> 01:03:53.434
Sancho.

01:03:53.436 --> 01:03:55.200
Forgive him, gracious madam.

01:03:55.202 --> 01:03:59.401
He's an ignorant peasant
who knows no better.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:04.867
I am Don Quixote de la
Mancha at your service.

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:06.667
Of course you are.

01:04:06.669 --> 01:04:08.269
Please arise, sir knight.

01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:12.733
Oh.

01:04:12.735 --> 01:04:15.733
I know of your famous exploits.

01:04:15.735 --> 01:04:19.767
And I know of your quest
for your Lady Dulcinea.

01:04:19.769 --> 01:04:21.601
Why are you talking like that?

01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:25.300
I know that this gentleman
has the courtliness

01:04:25.302 --> 01:04:27.966
of a true knight.

01:04:27.968 --> 01:04:29.633
A rustic, huh?

01:04:29.635 --> 01:04:31.300
I heard that.

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.466
Oh, such ears.

01:04:33.468 --> 01:04:35.366
Perhaps he caught
something from his donkey.

01:04:35.368 --> 01:04:36.933
Huh, Sancho?

01:04:36.935 --> 01:04:37.767
(BRAYING)

01:04:37.769 --> 01:04:38.900
Yes.

01:04:38.902 --> 01:04:41.534
Sancho was always so stubborn.

01:04:41.536 --> 01:04:42.733
So greedy.

01:04:42.735 --> 01:04:45.966
So mesmerizing...
a real enchanted.

01:04:45.968 --> 01:04:47.200
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:04:47.202 --> 01:04:47.966
- Don't say that.
- Enchanter?

01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:49.833
- Oh, yes.
- What?

01:04:49.835 --> 01:04:50.700
Sancho?

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:52.500
No, not enchanter.

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:53.533
Not enchanter!

01:04:53.535 --> 01:04:55.201
Sancho, is this you?

01:04:55.203 --> 01:04:56.899
Speak.

01:04:56.901 --> 01:04:58.501
Of course it is!

01:04:58.503 --> 01:04:59.366
I mean, I'm not Sancho.

01:04:59.368 --> 01:05:00.799
I'm a...

01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:03.835
Malambrino, the enchanter,
the fiend in disguise.

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:07.833
Wait, wait, wait.
You know what?

01:05:07.835 --> 01:05:09.267
I'm fucking Sancho.

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:10.400
You don't recognize my face?

01:05:10.402 --> 01:05:11.733
I'm Sancho.

01:05:11.735 --> 01:05:13.301
Sancho?

01:05:13.303 --> 01:05:14.266
She didn't say enchanter.

01:05:14.268 --> 01:05:15.500
She said... she said...

01:05:15.502 --> 01:05:16.568
she said chanter.

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.401
I said enchanter.

01:05:18.403 --> 01:05:19.567
I'm a chanter...

01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:20.967
Cantor... Eddie Cantor...

01:05:20.969 --> 01:05:23.732
Eddie Cantor, only not
totally Jewish looking.

01:05:23.734 --> 01:05:25.732
Fuck it!

01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:30.567
(SINGING) If you knew
Susie like I know Susie...

01:05:30.569 --> 01:05:33.666
oh, oh, oh, what a gal.

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:37.266
There's none so classy
as this fair lassie...

01:05:37.268 --> 01:05:40.733
oh, oh, oh my goodness,
what a chassis.

01:05:40.735 --> 01:05:41.899
We went riding.

01:05:41.901 --> 01:05:43.767
She didn't balk.

01:05:43.769 --> 01:05:46.633
From the country, I'm
the one that had to walk.

01:05:46.635 --> 01:05:49.933
If you knew Susie
like I know Susie...

01:05:49.935 --> 01:05:55.767
(TOGETHER) Oh, oh, what a gal!

01:05:55.769 --> 01:05:57.301
Oh, oh.

01:05:57.303 --> 01:06:00.533
You had me worried for
a moment there, Sancho.

01:06:00.535 --> 01:06:01.732
I have to go.

01:06:01.734 --> 01:06:03.333
- Goodbye, Toby.
- No.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:04.333
Stay, dear lady.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:05.334
No, no, I'll come with you.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.500
No, no, no, no.

01:06:06.502 --> 01:06:08.899
She needs a true
escort, a knight.

01:06:08.901 --> 01:06:09.570
Step aside.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:13.733
Gracious lady.

01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:14.732
TOBY: Let me help your foot.

01:06:14.734 --> 01:06:16.833
Let me help you.

01:06:16.835 --> 01:06:19.500
Get your hand off her, Sancho.

01:06:19.502 --> 01:06:20.267
Hey!

01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:21.201
Hah!

01:06:21.203 --> 01:06:22.599
(HORSE WHINNYING)

01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:24.333
You touched her with
your filthy peasant hands.

01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:25.300
Filthy?

01:06:25.302 --> 01:06:26.301
You're the dirty old man.

01:06:26.303 --> 01:06:27.533
How dare you say that to me.

01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:28.700
- I'll thrash you for that!
- All right.

01:06:28.702 --> 01:06:29.867
Stop, stop, stop.

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:30.799
What?

01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:32.766
We should follow her.

01:06:32.768 --> 01:06:34.200
I think she needs our help.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:38.301
Love is a cruel
jailer, Sancho.

01:06:38.303 --> 01:06:39.434
What?

01:06:39.436 --> 01:06:40.733
Did you see the
look in her eyes?

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:41.699
Oh, let me guess?

01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:42.599
She fell in love with you.

01:06:42.601 --> 01:06:43.501
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:47.599
It's a curse, Sancho.

01:06:47.601 --> 01:06:49.433
It's a curse.

01:06:49.435 --> 01:06:49.967
Come on.
Come on.

01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:51.301
Come on.

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:52.632
Can't these things
go any faster?

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.466
How are we going to
follow them like this?

01:06:54.468 --> 01:07:00.867
Sancho, a knight-errant, he
wanders, he roams, he seeks.

01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:02.700
He never follows.

01:07:02.702 --> 01:07:03.603
TOBY: Heeya, heeya.

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:14.504
Angelica's scarf.

01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:23.835
Shit.

01:07:28.469 --> 01:07:30.434
We'll never find her now.

01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:32.866
It's a heaven-sent
blessing, Sancho.

01:07:32.868 --> 01:07:34.300
We have a quest.

01:07:34.302 --> 01:07:35.566
A what?

01:07:35.568 --> 01:07:37.201
A quest.

01:07:37.203 --> 01:07:39.400
- An impossible quest.
- Oh, great.

01:07:39.402 --> 01:07:40.599
- (SHEEP BLEATING)
- Listen, Sancho.

01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:43.334
Do you hear that?

01:07:43.336 --> 01:07:44.266
The call of the Muezzin.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:46.732
(SHEEP BLEATING)

01:07:46.734 --> 01:07:48.201
The what?

01:07:48.203 --> 01:07:51.599
The Muslim call to prayer.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:54.234
Listen, Sancho.

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.237
Sancho, listen.

01:08:02.402 --> 01:08:03.668
Oh, Sancho.

01:08:07.701 --> 01:08:11.700
We are on hallowed
ground, Sancho.

01:08:11.702 --> 01:08:14.532
Bow your head, Sancho.

01:08:14.534 --> 01:08:17.767
Bow your head.

01:08:17.769 --> 01:08:21.201
Sancho, bow your head.

01:08:21.203 --> 01:08:26.866
Our Christ has brought us to Al
Hazzaharaha, the last citadel

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:28.332
of the Moorish kings.

01:08:28.335 --> 01:08:30.933
And there, do you see?

01:08:30.935 --> 01:08:32.698
There they are.

01:08:32.701 --> 01:08:37.966
The wise chorus in their
robes of white, their heads

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:39.899
bowed in prayer to Allah.

01:08:39.902 --> 01:08:41.466
Those are sheep.

01:08:41.468 --> 01:08:43.966
You ignorant
peasant, why speak

01:08:43.969 --> 01:08:47.434
badly of them just because
they worship a heathen god.

01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:55.201
(SIGHS) Oh, Sancho,
follow me with humility.

01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:57.966
Al Zagal the
great Moorish warrior

01:08:57.969 --> 01:09:02.765
once trod these
magnificent halls.

01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:04.367
Who knows?

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:08.666
Perhaps these wise men
know of the lady we seek.

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.432
Great.

01:09:10.434 --> 01:09:13.700
Then can we just get
out of the fucking sun.

01:09:13.702 --> 01:09:17.465
Sancho, they are welcoming us.

01:09:17.466 --> 01:09:18.399
Oh no, gentlemen.

01:09:18.402 --> 01:09:20.301
There is no need to bow.

01:09:20.303 --> 01:09:23.903
I am just a poor Christian
knight on a quest.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:29.566
In the perfumed
court to the sultan,

01:09:29.568 --> 01:09:32.832
the days are passed
in sweet music

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:36.732
and gentle delights
with gracious noblemen

01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:39.733
and courtly ladies.

01:09:39.734 --> 01:09:40.899
I'm starving!

01:09:40.901 --> 01:09:43.466
Well then eat, Sancho.

01:09:43.468 --> 01:09:45.933
Food makes a
peasant's heart glad.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:46.899
What's this?

01:09:46.902 --> 01:09:50.465
Wha... oh, a conundrum.

01:09:50.466 --> 01:09:52.832
Is this one of your
riddles, Sancho?

01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:54.900
Oh, I like a riddle.

01:09:54.902 --> 01:09:55.833
Oh, what is this?

01:09:55.835 --> 01:09:56.867
Let's see.

01:09:56.869 --> 01:09:59.267
It's a... it's a horse and cart.

01:09:59.269 --> 01:09:59.967
Is that it?

01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:01.600
I mean what's in it?

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:03.267
What's in it.

01:10:03.269 --> 01:10:04.700
Mm, let's see.

01:10:04.702 --> 01:10:08.666
It's a got a goose...

01:10:08.668 --> 01:10:13.233
(HONKING) (LAUGHS)
or a wild hippogriff?

01:10:13.235 --> 01:10:16.137
(CROWING)

01:10:18.235 --> 01:10:19.835
- (LAUGHS)
- You're pathetic.

01:10:24.634 --> 01:10:25.966
Yeah.

01:10:25.968 --> 01:10:29.599
It would be easy
if I was, Sancho.

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:34.399
It would be easy if I were
allowed to be an old man.

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:40.365
But I am bound to honor
the code of knight-errant.

01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:41.934
Well chivalry
is dead and gone.

01:10:41.936 --> 01:10:43.266
I'm very sorry.

01:10:43.268 --> 01:10:45.333
It probably never
existed anyway.

01:10:45.335 --> 01:10:51.399
(SINGING) Oh never
was there a knight

01:10:51.401 --> 01:10:58.533
so sad as he who lost his love...

01:10:58.535 --> 01:11:02.466
TOBY: Shut the fuck up!

01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:04.599
(SINGING) ...love.

01:11:04.601 --> 01:11:08.399
My servant calls to...

01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:09.266
(MAN SINGING)

01:11:09.268 --> 01:11:10.465
TOBY: Shh.
Shh.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:13.300
Shh.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:16.267
MAN: (SINGING) But
foolishly he leaves

01:11:16.269 --> 01:11:18.599
his horse behind the quest...

01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:19.502
(WHISPERING) Sancho.

01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:28.201
Oh, most beauteous and
cruel hearted maiden,

01:11:28.203 --> 01:11:31.832
must you allow your captive
knight to waste and perish

01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:34.733
in this endless wandering?

01:11:34.735 --> 01:11:37.633
Dead and gone, Sancho?

01:11:37.635 --> 01:11:41.799
(ROARING) Release me
from my enchantment.

01:11:41.801 --> 01:11:44.268
(ROARING)

01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:49.800
It is not enough
that I've forced

01:11:49.802 --> 01:11:51.667
even the famous Don
Quixote of la Mancha

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:53.468
- to kneel to your beauty.
- Que?

01:11:56.935 --> 01:11:58.567
Who's there?

01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:03.532
A knight-errant accompanied
by his loyal squirrel,

01:12:03.534 --> 01:12:04.532
Sancho Panza.

01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:05.499
(WHISPERING) It's squire...

01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:07.332
loyal squire!

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:13.266
Accompanied by his line
squirrel, Sancho Panza.

01:12:13.268 --> 01:12:18.201
Sir, I doubt if you'll
vanquish the real Don Quixote.

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:20.934
Somebody impersonating
him, perhaps?

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.900
For a full day
and night, I pulled

01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:24.832
Don Quixote hand to hand.

01:12:24.834 --> 01:12:29.899
Finally, forced him to submit
and bow down to my lady.

01:12:29.901 --> 01:12:31.465
Liar.

01:12:31.467 --> 01:12:36.866
I am the real Don
Quixote in person.

01:12:36.868 --> 01:12:38.832
You doubt my word, old man?

01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:42.867
You'd do better to
return to your bed.

01:12:42.869 --> 01:12:48.299
It's essential when faced with
the purity of a true knight,

01:12:48.301 --> 01:12:49.768
the false knight retreats.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.499
He's probably wet himself.

01:12:54.501 --> 01:12:56.433

you shut the fuck up?

01:12:56.435 --> 01:12:57.137
It's time to go.

01:13:02.969 --> 01:13:04.600
Yes.

01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:07.600
Let the conquered be at
the mercy of the conqueror.

01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:08.603
Agreed.

01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:15.433
I'm bound by the
laws of chivalry.

01:13:15.435 --> 01:13:16.436
Agreed.

01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:23.532
This is ridiculous.

No.

Do not be afraid.

01:13:37.467 --> 01:13:41.702
We have been through
far worse, my friend.

01:13:47.234 --> 01:13:50.399

make a stirrup.

Don't do this.

01:14:02.535 --> 01:14:03.899
You can get seriously hurt.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:15.803
I entrust my heart
to my Lady Dulcinea.

about squires?

01:14:24.901 --> 01:14:27.767

if you get killed?

Oh, Sancho.

01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:11.199
What if your friends were
who they said they were?

01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:12.631
Oh.

01:23:12.633 --> 01:23:17.433
The enchanters have got
their talons into you, hmm?

01:23:17.435 --> 01:23:19.865
Never doubt, Sancho.

01:23:19.867 --> 01:23:22.766
That's what they want you to do.

01:23:22.768 --> 01:23:28.232
We must always
believe in ourselves,

01:23:28.234 --> 01:23:33.499
ahh, whatever the cost.

01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:37.466
It is our story, Sancho,
not some pretend...

01:23:37.468 --> 01:23:40.731
(TRUMPETS SOUNDING)

01:23:40.733 --> 01:23:43.233
Sancho, my son.

01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:45.269
Great fortune smiles on us.

01:23:49.368 --> 01:23:54.232
Behold, I am rewarded
for my penance.

01:23:54.234 --> 01:23:55.834
My fair lady has forgiven me.

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:00.666
Go to her, Sancho.

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:03.599
Tell her that Don
Quixote de la Mancha,

01:24:03.601 --> 01:24:06.366
her knight of the
mournful countenance,

01:24:06.368 --> 01:24:09.765
humbly awaits her command.

01:24:09.767 --> 01:24:12.236
(SIGHS)

01:24:14.767 --> 01:24:16.632
Wait.
How am I supposed to say that?

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:19.601
Have you learned
nothing at my side, hmm?

01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:37.366
Uh, hello there.

01:24:37.368 --> 01:24:39.400
Your highness, fair... fair...

01:24:39.402 --> 01:24:47.200
fair huntress, lofty
majesty, my master...

01:24:47.202 --> 01:24:48.532
my master begged me...

01:24:48.534 --> 01:24:51.366
Lady Dulcinea, my
master begged me...

01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:53.599
Toby?

01:24:53.601 --> 01:24:54.566
TOBY: What?

01:24:54.568 --> 01:24:56.734
- It is you.
- Jacqui?

01:24:59.633 --> 01:25:00.798
Ah, ah.
No, no.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.199
- Stop, stop.
- That's all right.

01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:02.832
- I'm pulling you back up.
- It's OK.

01:25:02.834 --> 01:25:03.765
He works for us.

01:25:03.767 --> 01:25:05.200
It's OK.

01:25:05.202 --> 01:25:06.932
Where have you been?

01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:10.599
We've been very
worried about you.

01:25:10.601 --> 01:25:11.602
You look terrible.

01:25:14.733 --> 01:25:15.832
I'm in trouble.

01:25:15.834 --> 01:25:18.200
Yeah, we heard.

01:25:18.202 --> 01:25:19.832
But don't worry
about the police.

01:25:19.834 --> 01:25:22.831
(WHISPERING) Alexei has the
law by the balls around here.

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:23.966
Alexei?

01:25:23.968 --> 01:25:26.531
Alexei Miisken,
the Vodka account.

01:25:26.533 --> 01:25:28.432
We're all staying with him.

01:25:28.434 --> 01:25:29.899
Tonight's the Holy
Week Festival.

01:25:29.901 --> 01:25:34.465
And he's throwing a big
costume party, lots of games.

01:25:34.467 --> 01:25:35.399
You'll love it.

01:25:35.401 --> 01:25:36.366
Come on.

01:25:36.368 --> 01:25:37.465
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:25:37.467 --> 01:25:41.699
Oh, uh, I'm not alone.

01:25:41.701 --> 01:25:42.731
Oh.

01:25:42.733 --> 01:25:46.565
(LAUGHS) You found your star.

01:25:46.567 --> 01:25:47.666
Oh.

01:25:47.668 --> 01:25:50.431
Yeah, I know.

01:25:50.433 --> 01:25:53.699
Trouble is now he actually
believes he's Don Quixote.

01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:55.431
Perfect.

01:25:55.433 --> 01:25:59.798
He's just what we need tonight,
something truly authentic.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.832
How sweet.

01:26:00.834 --> 01:26:01.831
No, it's actually really sad.

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:03.464
He... he really needs help.

01:26:03.466 --> 01:26:04.865
Oh... oh no.

01:26:04.867 --> 01:26:08.531
Please don't go all
sentimental on us now, Toby.

01:26:08.533 --> 01:26:09.899
This is going to be fun.

(TRUMPETS SOUNDING)

01:26:33.734 --> 01:26:36.666
I'm still very angry
with you, you know?

01:26:36.668 --> 01:26:38.136
You better be extra nice to me.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.401
Tally-ho.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.266
You do know that's not
your Dulcinea, right?

01:26:49.268 --> 01:26:51.566
What made you think she was.

01:26:51.568 --> 01:26:54.465
I'm beginning to worry
about you, Sancho.

01:26:54.467 --> 01:26:55.268
You'd better behave.

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.665
Don't be nervous, Sancho.

01:27:13.667 --> 01:27:17.732
This is our reward for all
the pain we have endured.

01:27:17.734 --> 01:27:22.665
Did I not say I would
make you a king?

01:27:22.667 --> 01:27:26.566
Welcome to you, Don
Quixote, the flower and

01:27:26.568 --> 01:27:29.865
cream of knight-errantry.

01:27:29.867 --> 01:27:33.731
Please be so kind as to
accept our hospitality

has returned from the wild,

things about you, Toby.

everything.

wasn't like that.

anything, my sweet?

We were both very young.

01:30:15.567 --> 01:30:17.965
It was um... a...

01:30:17.967 --> 01:30:19.465
a student film.

(LAUGHS) If you
could call it that.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.431
I mean, you can't call it...

play in this passion

She was...

01:30:35.733 --> 01:30:39.331
(LAUGHS) she was a girl.

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:41.298
A girl?
TOBY: Yeah.

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.498
Just a girl?

Yeah, that's it.

01:30:44.201 --> 01:30:47.898
We never... (LAUGHS)
never gave her a name.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.332
No.

01:30:49.334 --> 01:30:53.468
- She has to be a movie star.
- Sure.

01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:05.631
Oh, um, yeah.

01:31:05.633 --> 01:31:08.299
I can't believe I'm saying...
this is not what it looks like.

01:31:08.301 --> 01:31:11.499
This... I understand
how the context is...

01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:13.666
looks... looks, uh, bad.

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:14.831
But this was not...

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.632
I mean, she is
wearing a bra, yes.

01:31:16.634 --> 01:31:19.199
But what is in the picture is
not what is actually happening.

01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:20.432
I mean, it's happening,
but it's not...

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:20.902
Stop talking.

01:31:32.734 --> 01:31:35.735
Ugh.
No.

01:31:42.367 --> 01:31:43.235
Clean it up.

01:31:52.233 --> 01:31:55.598
Clean it up.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.332
Here, come here.

01:31:56.334 --> 01:31:57.335
I'll do it.

01:32:00.401 --> 01:32:01.701
Do it now.

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:20.635
Oh.

01:32:32.567 --> 01:32:33.667
Here... in case you
spill anything else.

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:53.501
Angelica.

01:32:56.467 --> 01:32:58.665
What are you doing here?

01:32:58.667 --> 01:32:59.668
Go away.

01:33:11.634 --> 01:33:14.666
What do you want?

01:33:14.668 --> 01:33:16.468
To rescue me?

01:33:19.633 --> 01:33:21.899
Well, yeah.

01:33:21.901 --> 01:33:23.666
From what?

01:33:23.668 --> 01:33:29.464
From that Russian pig, from
this, from this, all of this.

01:33:29.466 --> 01:33:30.498
Yes, I see.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.566
I see what you mean.

01:33:32.568 --> 01:33:40.232
It is a little extravagant,
far too beautiful.

01:33:40.234 --> 01:33:43.265
But I'm getting used to it.

01:33:43.267 --> 01:33:46.732
Toby, I am happy here.

01:33:46.734 --> 01:33:50.499
I have everything
you promised I would.

01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:53.332
So you're just going to
let him treat you like that?

01:33:53.334 --> 01:33:56.965
He was reminding
me who I belong to.

01:33:56.967 --> 01:33:57.835
That's all.

01:34:03.801 --> 01:34:11.168
Do you have the cojones to
steal Alexei's property?

01:34:16.567 --> 01:34:18.464
Yeah.

01:34:18.466 --> 01:34:21.331
Didn't think so.

01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:22.335
Fuck you.

01:34:24.601 --> 01:34:28.798
Only Alexei does that.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:29.698
OK.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:30.666
Then how much?
Huh?

01:34:30.668 --> 01:34:31.432
What's you're going rate?

01:34:31.434 --> 01:34:32.699
Is that enough?

01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:33.698
Huh?

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.264
Hey!

01:34:35.266 --> 01:34:36.167
What the fuck?

01:34:58.899 --> 01:35:01.566
You naughty boy.

01:35:01.568 --> 01:35:03.298
They're not real.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.666
Are things real, Toby?

01:35:04.668 --> 01:35:05.565
Come on, Toby.

01:35:05.567 --> 01:35:06.531
Pull yourself together.

01:35:06.533 --> 01:35:07.766
You're making me nervous.

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.532
Something has to be.

01:35:09.534 --> 01:35:11.499
The Boss has put me in charge
of tonight's entertainment.

01:35:11.501 --> 01:35:13.431
- Rupert.
- I had this peachy idea.

01:35:13.433 --> 01:35:14.732
It's like kid of the
one you used to have.

01:35:14.734 --> 01:35:15.964
- Rupert.
- You're going to love it.

01:35:15.966 --> 01:35:16.964
- Rupert.
- What is it?

01:35:16.966 --> 01:35:17.731
- Rupert.
- What is it?

01:35:17.733 --> 01:35:20.732
I'm listening.

01:35:20.734 --> 01:35:24.865
Would you mind just
rubbing my back, please?

01:35:24.867 --> 01:35:27.832
You know like you used to... a
