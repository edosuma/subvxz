00:01.097 --> 00:03.247
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.297 --> 00:07.006
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:07.057 --> 00:11.130
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:11.177 --> 00:14.613
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.657 --> 00:16.454
'These are their stories.'

00:18.017 --> 00:22.727
All right, people, listen up.
One, Police Plaza's latest directive,

00:22.777 --> 00:25.132
biyearly psychological evaluations.

00:25.177 --> 00:27.168
Biyearly for bipolars.

00:27.217 --> 00:32.928
They've picked one of the highest-stress
units as the lucky guinea pig.

00:32.977 --> 00:37.255
- Not us?
- Us. Please fill out this form.

00:37.297 --> 00:42.132
You'll be receiving your appointment times
from our psychologist. Questions?

00:42.177 --> 00:46.090
- Will it go on our permanent record?
- It'll be confidential.

00:46.137 --> 00:50.255
At the risk of sounding like John,
what is their angle?

00:50.297 --> 00:53.209
- Can you flunk it? If so what happens?
- I don't know.

00:54.617 --> 00:56.812
OK, so, er, who goes first?

00:56.857 --> 00:59.769
I do. The blind leading the blind.

00:59.817 --> 01:04.208
I bet they just slapped a new cover
on the old Minnesota Multiphasic.

01:04.257 --> 01:05.849
Do you believe this?

01:05.897 --> 01:09.128
Shrinks get shrunk,
maybe we could use a little.

01:09.177 --> 01:11.532
Hi. Can I help you?

01:11.577 --> 01:15.536
Yes, they tell me to report sex crime here.

01:15.577 --> 01:18.045
OK. Why don't you have a seat right here?

01:20.417 --> 01:23.170
OK. Go ahead, we're listening.

01:23.217 --> 01:27.176
Erm, I have a fruit stand
on Lex and 78th Street.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.732
Two boys run up,
grab bananas and take off.

01:30.777 --> 01:33.450
That sounds like a robbery.

01:33.497 --> 01:37.456
No. You see, when I'm angry
I curse in my native tongue.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.330
- Which is Hungarian, Romanian?
- Romanian.

01:40.377 --> 01:45.405
Then this woman grabs me and begs me
to help her. Also in Romanian.

01:45.457 --> 01:47.971
- What was wrong?
- A man.

01:48.017 --> 01:52.807
She's trapped in this situation
she cannot escape from.

01:53.817 --> 01:57.935
It does not translate well, but there is abuse.

01:57.977 --> 02:00.127
- Physical or sexual?
- I think both.

02:00.177 --> 02:02.816
- What's her name?
- She does not tell me.

02:02.857 --> 02:07.692
- You know where she lives?
- She does not tell me that either.

02:07.737 --> 02:10.570
Er... she hands me this.

02:12.577 --> 02:14.647
Constanta Condrescu.

02:14.697 --> 02:19.612
She says, 'Tell her she was right.
I need help.'

02:20.657 --> 02:22.693
And then she takes off.

02:22.737 --> 02:25.046
What time did all this happen?

02:26.377 --> 02:28.333
Three days ago.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.057 --> 03:19.013
Big brown eyes.

03:19.057 --> 03:22.015
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

03:22.057 --> 03:25.015
OK. Let me see if I got this straight.

03:25.057 --> 03:29.812
Some girl is being sexually abused
by some guy somewhere in Manhattan.

03:29.857 --> 03:33.008
- Something like that.
- Do we have a description?

03:33.057 --> 03:36.606
The sketch artist's
working with the fruit vendor.

03:36.657 --> 03:40.047
- What's your take on this guy?
- He's Mircha Gabrea.

03:40.097 --> 03:44.215
Seems lucid enough. Came here a few
years back. Never been in trouble.

03:44.257 --> 03:47.055
The only reason he came in
was to shut his wife up.

03:47.097 --> 03:50.931
He let the story slip but she wouldn't lay off
until he did something.

03:50.977 --> 03:54.253
Assuming he's on the up and up,
how do we know the girl is?

03:54.297 --> 03:59.246
Thousands of women are abused by
their lesser halves. We have to check it out.

03:59.297 --> 04:02.926
What if Woodward and Bernstein had
blown off Deep Throat as a prank call?

04:02.977 --> 04:05.855
Prank call or not,
it's three days cold now.

04:12.977 --> 04:17.607
- Sorry. I don't recognise her.
- It's not a common name.

04:17.656 --> 04:21.047
What are the odds
she pulled the name outta thin air?

04:23.057 --> 04:26.447
She's my niece. We're not close.

04:27.457 --> 04:30.654
Are you close enough to know her name?

04:31.657 --> 04:36.572
- Ilena. Ilena Condrescu.
- Why did you lie about knowing her?

04:36.617 --> 04:39.575
Where I come from the less
you tell police, the better.

04:39.617 --> 04:42.654
Where you come from, she's not in trouble,
but she may be here.

04:42.697 --> 04:45.370
If she is, we'd like to help her.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.647
Now, Miss Condrescu.

04:49.937 --> 04:51.336
Is this your niece?

04:51.377 --> 04:53.368
Yes.

04:53.417 --> 04:57.808
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Go ahead. It's of no use.

04:57.857 --> 05:03.568
She reached out to you. You must know
where she is or who she's with.

05:03.617 --> 05:08.896
I don't. I haven't seen her in three years.
Since she first came here.

05:08.937 --> 05:13.010
- And how did she get here?
- On a student visa.

05:13.057 --> 05:16.254
- Which school?
- NYU.

05:16.297 --> 05:19.414
That's when we went our separate ways.

05:19.457 --> 05:22.415
I'm sorry but my shift starts soon.

05:22.457 --> 05:25.813
OK. Look, I'm gonna give you my card.

05:25.857 --> 05:29.736
If there's anything you think of
that may help us find her,

05:29.777 --> 05:32.530
please give us a call, OK?

05:32.577 --> 05:36.934
We should have pressed harder.
She's holding something back.

05:36.977 --> 05:40.731
We're not the Romanian secret police,
but at least we got a name and photo.

05:40.777 --> 05:42.733
It's Detective Stabler.

05:42.777 --> 05:48.329
I want you to run a database check
on an Ilena, l-L-E-N-A, Condrescu.

05:48.377 --> 05:52.848
No, C-O. Condrescu. And if you
don't get a hit check NYU. Thanks.

05:52.897 --> 05:56.526
- That's where she should be.
- I'll get Munch on it.

05:58.377 --> 06:00.732
She never showed up.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.530
- Does it mention why?
- No.

06:03.577 --> 06:08.128
Does it mention why somewhere?
In her application files?

06:08.177 --> 06:12.967
Do you know how many tens of thousands
of students apply each year?

06:13.017 --> 06:15.406
These are all student files.

06:20.457 --> 06:23.415
So, er, this is what it feels like?

06:23.457 --> 06:26.608
- What does?
- To be the suspect.

06:26.657 --> 06:29.490
Just kidding. Sort of.

06:29.537 --> 06:31.812
Sit down.

06:32.857 --> 06:35.655
- Relax.
- Yeah, right.

06:35.697 --> 06:38.370
- You can't relax?
- I golf a little.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.567
A little? What's your handicap?

06:40.617 --> 06:44.610
- I don't know. 12, 14.
- It must be difficult to get to a course.

06:44.657 --> 06:46.966
It's a commitment but I get out.

06:47.017 --> 06:49.485
So, what else do you do for fun?

06:49.537 --> 06:52.574
What do you mean, for fun?

06:52.617 --> 06:57.168
What you do to relax. Go jogging?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.173
- Racket ball?
- Yeah.

06:59.217 --> 07:02.175
- Walk?
- It's New York, everybody walks.

07:02.217 --> 07:05.015
Don, come on, you see it every day.

07:05.057 --> 07:09.448
Rape, murder, torture. As sure as
your morning cup of coffee.

07:09.497 --> 07:13.206
On top of that,
you've got responsibilities of command.

07:13.257 --> 07:15.725
I'm sorry, is that a question?

07:15.777 --> 07:17.847
How well do you handle the stress?

07:17.897 --> 07:19.853
I handle it.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.365
All right, how do you handle it?

07:22.417 --> 07:25.375
This is ridiculous.
Why don't you just ask me?

07:25.417 --> 07:29.729
- Ask you...?
- The question you're tap-dancing around.

07:29.777 --> 07:35.170
Do I get the urge to drink?
See, that's the problem with you people.

07:35.217 --> 07:38.846
You ask about golfing,

07:38.897 --> 07:42.446
or jogging or whether a person
was breast-fed or not.

07:42.497 --> 07:45.967
Why don't you just ask me
about my alcoholism?

07:46.017 --> 07:49.327
That's what this has been about, hasn't it?

07:49.377 --> 07:52.289
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No, I don't.

07:54.097 --> 07:56.167
But I will.

07:57.337 --> 07:59.293
Yes.

07:59.337 --> 08:01.976
I get the urge to drink.

08:02.017 --> 08:04.577
Every day.

08:04.617 --> 08:10.010
I see horrific acts of degradation,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.013
of brutality,

08:12.057 --> 08:14.013
of human evil.

08:14.057 --> 08:16.412
They make me angry.

08:16.457 --> 08:21.008
They make me sick. They get inside
my head and I wanna shut them up.

08:21.057 --> 08:24.447
I know if I crawl inside of a bottle,
they will stop.

08:26.497 --> 08:31.093
- Do you think you will?
- Ask me tomorrow.

08:38.097 --> 08:41.009
- Have you seen this woman before?
- Excuse me.

08:41.057 --> 08:44.413
What can I make you?
You look like a wiener dog guy.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.733
You're wrong.
Have you seen this woman before?

08:47.777 --> 08:50.928
- Yeah, I see her all the time.
- Positive?

08:50.977 --> 08:54.856
- Yeah. Cute accent. Russian, Czech.
- Do you know who she is?

08:54.897 --> 08:59.732
I made her a green ladybug. I had her
pegged as a red poodle type. Go figure.

08:59.777 --> 09:02.530
Balloon guy says he knows our girl.

09:02.577 --> 09:05.933
Sir? Excuse me.
Are you sure that it was her?

09:05.977 --> 09:10.767
I never forget a paying customer.
She's dropped a few pounds since then.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.614
Ever seen her with anyone?

09:12.657 --> 09:15.251
I'll make you a giraffe. On the house.

09:15.297 --> 09:19.336
- Have you ever seen her with anyone?
- A little girl. Eight.

09:19.377 --> 09:21.937
- Here we go, kid.
- Look again.

09:21.977 --> 09:25.936
She's 21 years old.
She couldn't have an eight-year-old.

09:25.977 --> 09:31.256
Not her own! American. Hey, you're
in the heart of nanny central here.

09:31.297 --> 09:35.575
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Yesterday.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.085
- Yesterday?
- He remembered her accent.

09:38.137 --> 09:43.086
He also remembered her being serene.
Wasn't under the least bit of stress.

09:43.137 --> 09:46.174
Three days ago she slips
a fruit vendor an SOS,

09:46.217 --> 09:49.493
a few days later she's at the park with a kid.

09:49.537 --> 09:53.212
- Case closed?
- No. No, it's not closed.

09:53.257 --> 09:58.047
Four of my top detectives wasted
an entire day on a wild-goose chase.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.976
That's 32 man-hours.
I want her in here explaining herself.

10:02.017 --> 10:05.532
Homicide just caught a dump job
off the Henry Hudson.

10:05.577 --> 10:08.569
Your card was in the victim's pocket.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.892
The body was rolled up in a rug
and dumped.

10:13.937 --> 10:14.926
When?

10:14.977 --> 10:18.936
The body's in great shape.
Minimum exposure to the elements.

10:18.977 --> 10:21.935
- Today?
- Today. Sometime last night.

10:21.977 --> 10:24.491
- Any witnesses?
- None that stopped.

10:24.537 --> 10:27.097
No one would notice a body being dumped.

10:27.137 --> 10:29.128
People dump stuff all the time.

10:29.177 --> 10:31.930
- Who found her?
- A fisherman.

10:31.977 --> 10:35.936
Thought he'd found a present
for the wife. Is this her?

10:35.977 --> 10:39.128
Yeah, that's her. Constanta Condrescu.

10:39.177 --> 10:42.965
Something tells me
she found a way to contact Ilena.

10:44.897 --> 10:48.810
She was dead when she hit the rug.
No fibres were inhaled.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.051
What killed her?

10:50.097 --> 10:53.248
Something stopped her heart
instantaneously.

10:53.297 --> 10:57.609
- What that was, only toxicology will tell.
- Got a time of death?

10:57.657 --> 11:01.252
- Between 4 and 6pm.
- We left her at four.

11:01.297 --> 11:05.256
Only an injection would cause
an attack this acute

11:05.297 --> 11:07.652
without affecting other organs.

11:07.697 --> 11:10.052
But I can't find a puncture wound.

11:10.097 --> 11:13.055
You checked the white-collar junkie places?

11:13.097 --> 11:17.454
Nothing between the toes,
behind the knees or in the genitals.

11:17.497 --> 11:20.455
What about under the tongue?

11:20.497 --> 11:24.092
For an accidental OD
that would make sense. But...

11:25.097 --> 11:32.048
It'd be very difficult,
if not impossible, for a killer to...

11:33.097 --> 11:34.610
Hm.

11:34.657 --> 11:38.093
How did a killer inject her under the tongue
with no struggle?

11:38.137 --> 11:39.536
He sedated her.

11:39.577 --> 11:44.890
So she hears her niece is in trouble, goes
to this guy and has a spiked drink with him?

11:44.937 --> 11:48.054
I guess so.
Two hours after we left, she's dead.

11:48.097 --> 11:50.133
We should have pressed her harder.

11:50.177 --> 11:55.410
I contacted Interpol. Ilena's father
was also murdered back in Romania.

11:55.457 --> 11:58.335
- When?
- '89, during the Ceausescu regime.

11:58.377 --> 12:02.734
- That's a big gap for a connection.
- Not when you consider the timing.

12:02.777 --> 12:07.293
People assume that the good guys
overthrew Ceausescu. They didn't.

12:07.337 --> 12:10.135
Maybe they knew where the bodies were.

12:10.177 --> 12:14.534
Whatever happened to them started there.
All roads lead to Romania.

12:14.577 --> 12:18.411
That may be so, but what do you say
we start in Murray Hill?

12:18.457 --> 12:20.971
Look. She didn't even finish her tea.

12:21.017 --> 12:25.215
She wasn't killed here,
but let's bag it up before we leave.

12:25.257 --> 12:28.090
Got an address book. It's open to the Cs.

12:28.137 --> 12:31.209
Tell me we have an address
for Ilena Condrescu.

12:31.257 --> 12:35.216
No, but the page where
it'd fall alphabetically is missing.

12:35.257 --> 12:37.213
OK, let's keep looking.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.815
- You guys in here?
- No.

12:38.857 --> 12:41.417
Canvass of the first floor was a wash.

12:41.457 --> 12:45.655
Yeah. Lady in 1 B remembers the victim.
She never saw the niece.

12:45.697 --> 12:48.370
You can try her work.

12:48.417 --> 12:54.174
Café Parhova, expatriates plotting
coups d'état over bowls of goulash.

12:54.217 --> 12:56.685
My partner.

12:56.737 --> 12:58.853
Her niece never came here.

12:58.897 --> 13:00.455
Had they been in contact?

13:00.497 --> 13:03.489
No. There had been a fight
when Ilena got here.

13:03.537 --> 13:06.097
- About?
- How she got here.

13:06.137 --> 13:10.892
Constanta was saving for her to come
to school but Ilena just shows up.

13:10.937 --> 13:12.689
How did she manage that?

13:12.737 --> 13:16.491
She met an American businessman
in a disco in Bucharest.

13:16.537 --> 13:18.653
He offered to help.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.494
I assume there was a catch.

13:20.537 --> 13:25.486
So did Constanta. She yelled at Ilena,
'Of course there's a catch!'

13:25.537 --> 13:30.486
Ilena said the ticket didn't cost him
anything, he was a frequent flyer,

13:30.537 --> 13:32.971
and that he knew of a part-time job.

13:33.017 --> 13:35.087
She said he was just a nice man.

13:35.137 --> 13:39.608
- Do you know this man's name?
- No. Just that he was American.

13:39.657 --> 13:43.696
- Do you think that's where Ilena went?
- Constanta assumed so.

13:43.737 --> 13:47.696
She tried to contact him
but he said he never heard from her.

13:47.737 --> 13:51.650
She tried a few more times
but nothing. Finally, she gave up.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.653
Thanks.

13:53.697 --> 13:58.452
You requested to be assigned to SVU.
Why don't you tell me about that?

13:58.497 --> 14:03.446
The question, 'Has anyone in
your family been the victim of a rape?'

14:03.497 --> 14:07.410
I checked yes.
I'm actually the child of a rape.

14:07.457 --> 14:10.415
How does that affect you on your job?

14:10.457 --> 14:14.689
I'm walking a tightrope.
I got too close to a case once.

14:14.737 --> 14:18.491
A Serbian rapist was killed by his victims

14:18.537 --> 14:21.449
and I got my ass in a sling over it.

14:21.497 --> 14:25.649
Has it ever interfered with
your ability to remain objective?

14:25.697 --> 14:27.369
No.

14:28.417 --> 14:32.933
You had occasion to use
deadly force a few months ago.

14:34.057 --> 14:38.733
My partner was about to be shot.
It was a reflex. We're trained to do that.

14:39.777 --> 14:46.250
OK. Say you couldn't be
a sex crimes detective any more,

14:46.297 --> 14:48.891
what would you be?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.248
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

15:06.297 --> 15:09.095
- How did it go?
- Cakewalk.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.569
What have you got?

15:12.617 --> 15:16.849
A Persian Kashan. More expensive
than you normally find in dump jobs.

15:16.897 --> 15:19.536
- How much?
- Around $5,000.

15:19.577 --> 15:23.729
- A perp with serious money.
- Or he killed her in a carpet store.

15:23.777 --> 15:25.654
You pull anything out of it?

15:25.697 --> 15:30.213
Your standard particles of dirt,
cotton, nylon fibres.

15:30.257 --> 15:33.010
Anything place- or person-specific?

15:33.057 --> 15:35.207
A human hair. Root intact.

15:35.257 --> 15:37.725
- Victim's?
- No. Definitely not.

15:37.777 --> 15:42.487
- No proof it's the doer's.
- No, but I'd like a suspect to compare it to.

15:44.857 --> 15:46.210
Ilena Condrescu.

15:46.257 --> 15:50.330
- Someone gave her a free ticket.
- When did she fly?

15:50.377 --> 15:52.333
August of '97.

15:52.377 --> 15:54.333
You're kidding me.

15:54.377 --> 15:58.928
Don't answer that. If you call
an airline you're on hold 20 minutes

15:58.977 --> 16:01.775
while being subjected
to a Clockwork Orangean loop

16:01.817 --> 16:04.285
on the benefits
of your awards programme.

16:04.337 --> 16:06.487
I believe that's your phone, sir.

16:09.537 --> 16:11.493
Munch.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.927
- Romania to JFK.
- Someone gave Ilena a ticket.

16:14.977 --> 16:19.448
Her aunt warned her he had
ulterior motives. We're finding out who.

16:20.537 --> 16:22.175
- Got it.
- Got it.

16:22.217 --> 16:25.254
- The frequent flyer is?
- Randolf Morrow.

16:25.297 --> 16:28.175
Randolf Morrow. Hold for the address.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.208
Hello?

16:33.217 --> 16:35.731
Can I help you?

16:35.777 --> 16:37.369
Ilena?

16:37.417 --> 16:41.808
I'm Detective Benson,
this is my partner Detective Stabler.

16:43.817 --> 16:46.570
It's OK, we're here to help you.

16:46.617 --> 16:49.370
- We got your message.
- What message?

16:49.417 --> 16:51.408
To your aunt.

16:52.777 --> 16:55.610
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.408
Who's here?

17:01.937 --> 17:06.852
- Mr and Mrs Morrow have been good to me.
- Where are the Morrows right now?

17:06.896 --> 17:11.607
At work. Dinner must be ready before
they get home. Is there anything else?

17:11.656 --> 17:15.491
- Yes. There's a hell of a lot more.
- Ilena, play with me.

17:16.497 --> 17:22.446
Your aunt was murdered an hour after
we informed her you were in trouble.

17:23.537 --> 17:25.811
I don't know anything about it.

17:26.857 --> 17:31.009
I've told you. I never gave anyone
a message like that.

17:31.057 --> 17:35.209
- Why would someone make that up?
- I don't know!

17:35.257 --> 17:41.492
Regardless of who sent the message,
we know your aunt came to see you.

17:41.537 --> 17:45.530
I haven't seen her in three years.

17:47.177 --> 17:51.614
Mr Morrow really doesn't like dinner
to be late.

17:54.617 --> 17:56.608
Please!

18:00.617 --> 18:03.609
We're very sorry for your loss.

18:05.137 --> 18:07.093
Ilena!

18:07.137 --> 18:12.086
You were supposed to start NYU
three years ago. Why didn't you?

18:19.697 --> 18:23.087
- When we told her about her aunt...
- Nothing. Not a blink.

18:23.137 --> 18:24.286
Stepford nanny.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.728
The only time she registered
any emotion was at dinner being late.

18:28.777 --> 18:32.486
- Stockholm Syndrome.
- Brainwashing?

18:33.577 --> 18:38.731
1973, four hostages were taken during
a bank robbery attempt in Stockholm.

18:38.777 --> 18:42.531
When the SWAT team tried to rescue them,
they resisted.

18:42.577 --> 18:46.365
After only six days of captivity.
When they were rescued,

18:46.417 --> 18:51.616
they refused to testify against their captors
and raised money for their defence.

18:51.657 --> 18:54.774
We have another Patty Hearst
on our hands?

18:54.817 --> 18:59.891
It doesn't take much to brainwash a person.
Isolation, threats of violence,

18:59.937 --> 19:02.087
and then random acts of kindness.

19:02.137 --> 19:06.255
In as little as 72 hours a person's psyche
can be broken down.

19:06.297 --> 19:08.288
Ilena's been there three years.

19:08.337 --> 19:11.454
If that's what happened,
she won't be any help.

19:11.497 --> 19:15.092
Get back there
and find out what's going on.

19:16.897 --> 19:20.173
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Do you?

19:20.217 --> 19:23.209
Have you dated since transferring here?

19:23.257 --> 19:25.532
Ah! Now I see where you're going.

19:25.577 --> 19:29.286
Does dealing with sexual deviants
every day affect me?

19:29.337 --> 19:32.488
The answer is no. Just ask my blow-up doll.

19:32.537 --> 19:36.735
Do you think this job has had
any effect on your sex life?

19:36.777 --> 19:39.052
No, but I've pinpointed what has.

19:39.097 --> 19:42.567
Believe it or not,
I have serious intimacy issues.

19:42.617 --> 19:46.974
I'm critical, I'm negative,
I have an occasional bout of...

19:47.017 --> 19:51.090
Let's see, melancholy.
I'm a lousy date, but a good cop.

19:51.137 --> 19:55.415
So, I guess
that just about covers everything.

19:55.457 --> 19:58.608
No, actually we have 45 minutes.

19:58.657 --> 20:02.445
You wanna hear a detailed account
of my sexual history?

20:04.217 --> 20:06.731
How do we kill the other 44 minutes?

20:06.777 --> 20:09.496
Do you always deflect questions with jokes?

20:09.537 --> 20:12.335
Do you always deflect jokes with questions?

20:12.377 --> 20:16.734
Have you experienced
sexual dysfunction since taking this job?

20:16.777 --> 20:20.850
- And I'd appreciate a serious answer.
- Once.

20:20.897 --> 20:24.173
Thank you. When did that happen?

20:24.217 --> 20:28.256
I'm not sure, but it was within
the last ten minutes. I'm sorry.

20:28.297 --> 20:31.050
Look, I'm not good talking about me.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.646
You're the expert,
why don't you talk about me?

20:34.697 --> 20:38.007
OK. You've been married multiple times.

20:38.057 --> 20:42.335
Each wife was beautiful
but not one matched you intellectually.

20:42.377 --> 20:45.608
You distrust all women,
any form of government,

20:45.657 --> 20:50.447
and you could smell a conspiracy
at a five-year-old's lemonade stand.

20:50.497 --> 20:52.408
Anything else?

20:52.457 --> 20:57.611
You've given up on relationships.
But you still believe in true love.

20:57.657 --> 21:03.254
The pain of never having found it
is unbearable.

21:07.137 --> 21:08.934
Anything else?

21:09.417 --> 21:11.977
Good neighbours, loving parents.

21:12.057 --> 21:14.491
Has Ilena talked to you about the Morrows?

21:14.537 --> 21:20.328
We've never really talked to her.
It sounds awful. She's been here a year.

21:20.377 --> 21:21.969
She's a very quiet girl.

21:22.017 --> 21:24.451
- She's been here a year?
- Yeah.

21:24.497 --> 21:29.571
- We heard she'd been here three years.
- No, one at the most. I'm sure.

21:29.617 --> 21:31.972
What do you know about the Morrows?

21:32.017 --> 21:36.249
She's a veterinarian. Anyone who
helps animals is OK in my book.

21:36.297 --> 21:38.333
And Mr Morrow?

21:38.377 --> 21:41.926
A corporate type.
Investment banker, I think.

21:42.537 --> 21:44.334
Sit.

21:49.137 --> 21:51.526
The couch is much more comfortable.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.408
Oh, I'm fine.

21:55.417 --> 21:58.966
Ilena told me about her aunt. It's tragic.

21:59.017 --> 22:04.375
We didn't know she had a relative here.
So I won't be much help. We never met.

22:04.417 --> 22:07.534
- You never met Ilena's aunt?
- No, sir.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.647
How did you meet Ilena?

22:09.697 --> 22:14.771
I was in Romania consulting on
some privatisation issues. A nightmare.

22:14.817 --> 22:20.175
Ilena wanted to come to the US, we needed
a nanny. If only all mergers were so easy.

22:20.217 --> 22:22.128
She's been with you three years?

22:22.177 --> 22:26.489
I guess it has been.
Listen, that chair is really so stiff.

22:26.537 --> 22:30.496
Your neighbour said
they've only noticed Ilena this year.

22:30.537 --> 22:35.531
This is New York. I couldn't tell you anything
about my neighbours.

22:35.577 --> 22:39.855
They're positive that Ilena
has only been with you this past year.

22:39.897 --> 22:42.252
Can you explain that?

22:42.297 --> 22:44.652
- Louise?
- Yes, sir?

22:44.697 --> 22:49.452
- What did I say about the blinds?
- You like them drawn late afternoon.

22:49.497 --> 22:51.613
And what time is it now?

22:51.657 --> 22:53.454
3:30, Mr Morrow.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.773
- Could you adjust them, please?
- Yes, sir.

22:58.937 --> 23:02.407
Could you do that now, Louise?
Thank you.

23:02.457 --> 23:06.928
I have an afternoon full of meetings.
Is there anything else?

23:06.977 --> 23:10.208
Yeah. Where were you
Monday between 4 and 6pm?

23:14.417 --> 23:18.774
I was in negotiations
with four corporate lawyers.

23:18.817 --> 23:21.012
I thank you for your time.

23:24.097 --> 23:28.295
Oh. You've got something on your suit.

23:31.657 --> 23:34.217
That guy was a real sweetheart.

23:34.257 --> 23:35.895
That couch was comfortable.

23:35.937 --> 23:39.009
By the way, nice move with the hair.

23:39.057 --> 23:42.766
Enjoy that? We'll match it up
with the one from the rug.

23:42.817 --> 23:45.650
Stabler. Good. What have you got?

23:46.657 --> 23:50.013
What's that? Thanks a lot.

23:50.057 --> 23:54.608
Toxicology just came back.
Constanta was killed with Beuthanasia.

23:54.657 --> 23:57.569
They use it to put animals to sleep.

24:02.257 --> 24:04.054
Come on, sweetie.

24:04.097 --> 24:07.851
Mrs Morrow, you work Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays.

24:07.897 --> 24:10.286
- Where were you last Monday?
- Home.

24:10.337 --> 24:14.296
- Did Ilena have any visitors that day?
- No.

24:14.337 --> 24:17.693
- Did your husband come home?
- No.

24:17.737 --> 24:21.093
- Barry, can I have some help?
- Sure, Dr Morrow.

24:21.137 --> 24:23.287
How are things going with Ilena?

24:23.337 --> 24:26.488
It works. We have a routine.

24:26.537 --> 24:30.212
My husband can explain it better.

24:32.697 --> 24:34.653
Dropped it.

24:34.697 --> 24:37.530
Do you and Ilena get along?

24:39.537 --> 24:44.657
My husband selected her... to help me.

24:44.697 --> 24:45.686
Barry?

24:45.737 --> 24:48.410
How close is your husband to Ilena?

24:48.457 --> 24:51.255
You should talk to my husband.

24:51.297 --> 24:54.812
Dr Morrow, we have a hit-and-run.

24:54.857 --> 24:56.813
Oh!

24:58.417 --> 25:01.932
- I should go. Barry, can you?
- Yeah.

25:02.977 --> 25:05.730
It's a nice facility you have here.

25:05.777 --> 25:08.530
Yeah. We got our own OR, recovery rooms.

25:08.577 --> 25:12.536
- Pharmacy?
- Yeah. It's just down the hall there.

25:12.577 --> 25:15.967
It's all computerised
so the DEA can monitor you?

25:16.017 --> 25:19.487
The monitoring's not as stringent
as with humans.

25:19.537 --> 25:23.849
Not many poodles become crackheads.
How about the vets?

25:23.897 --> 25:28.015
Erm... Look, I really have to do a rectal so...

25:28.057 --> 25:34.132
By all means. Give us a call if you
think of anything you wanna tell us.

25:34.177 --> 25:35.929
Sure.

25:35.977 --> 25:40.926
You were recently injured in the line of duty.
Tell me what happened.

25:40.977 --> 25:44.333
Sure. I was in a foot pursuit
of a rape suspect

25:44.377 --> 25:47.528
when the car he stepped into
blew to high heaven.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.887
So you were only a step or two
to going with him.

25:50.937 --> 25:56.057
Sometimes after a near-death experience,
an officer gets tentative.

25:56.097 --> 26:00.056
Maybe just a split-second hesitation
before pulling a weapon?

26:00.097 --> 26:03.055
- No. Nothing like that at all.
- No?

26:03.097 --> 26:06.009
No. I've never felt more confident.

26:06.057 --> 26:10.767
- How so?
- I always knew that this day might come.

26:10.817 --> 26:15.572
I wondered what would happen.
The day came. And I walked away from it.

26:15.617 --> 26:21.249
I feel alive. Like three shots
of espresso without the jitters.

26:21.297 --> 26:24.175
Are you presently in a relationship?

26:24.217 --> 26:29.496
I had been in a relationship
but when I started working here, that ended.

26:29.537 --> 26:31.926
So did dating in general, actually.

26:31.977 --> 26:36.334
Erm, I guess I'd been celibate,

26:36.377 --> 26:38.527
well, up until...

26:38.577 --> 26:42.013
Huh. Actually, up until the accident.

26:42.057 --> 26:45.015
So, you're dating again?

26:45.057 --> 26:50.085
Uh-huh. A lot. I guess it sort of
made me realise how short life is.

26:50.137 --> 26:52.412
You've met a man?

26:52.457 --> 26:55.415
Well, not a man, different men.

26:55.457 --> 26:59.132
I don't know, I guess I kinda feel restless.

27:01.657 --> 27:05.172
- What is it?
- Nothing.

27:05.217 --> 27:07.447
No, you were gonna say something.

27:07.497 --> 27:10.489
No, no. It's nothing. I...

27:11.497 --> 27:17.732
A few nights ago I was at this bar
and there was this guy watching me.

27:17.777 --> 27:20.450
- Staring at me.
- And?

27:20.497 --> 27:22.852
And we started dancing.

27:22.897 --> 27:26.651
I thought I recognised him
but I couldn't place him.

27:26.697 --> 27:32.966
Outside under the streetlight it hit me
where I recognised this guy from.

27:33.017 --> 27:34.973
Who was he?

27:35.017 --> 27:38.453
A guy I'd been watching
a year earlier on a case.

27:38.497 --> 27:40.488
We liked him for a suspect.

27:41.537 --> 27:44.097
What did you do?

27:48.097 --> 27:51.134
I went home with him.

27:53.137 --> 27:56.095
Hey. Hey! Are you all right?

27:56.137 --> 27:58.697
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

27:58.737 --> 28:02.696
The psyche exam.
Dr Giggles had me wanting to eat my gun.

28:02.737 --> 28:04.409
No, I'm fine.

28:04.457 --> 28:06.129
- Monique?
- Excuse me.

28:06.177 --> 28:10.534
- Yeah, what?
- I'm looking for Benson or Stabler.

28:13.257 --> 28:17.967
- Had the inventory been fudged?
- Vets are under a lot of pressure.

28:18.017 --> 28:23.375
So when tranquillisers like Valium
go missing, it's the nature of the business.

28:23.417 --> 28:28.172
- But?
- Beuthanasia's another thing entirely.

28:28.217 --> 28:31.289
Did Mrs Morrow take some?

28:32.297 --> 28:37.974
Yeah. A few months ago.
I couldn't figure out why. The stuff's lethal.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.973
You're sure it's Beuthanasia?

28:40.017 --> 28:43.896
Yeah. The stuff's bright pink.
There's no mistaking it.

28:43.937 --> 28:46.895
You took a lethal drug home from work?

28:46.937 --> 28:50.691
The same lethal drug that killed Constanta.

28:50.737 --> 28:52.728
That was for me.

28:55.737 --> 28:57.295
Why?

28:57.337 --> 29:02.013
Because your husband was having sex
with Ilena right under your nose?

29:02.057 --> 29:06.289
Sexuality is about reaching our limits
and transcending them.

29:09.177 --> 29:13.967
So did your husband transcend Ilena's aunt?
Is that what happened?

29:14.017 --> 29:17.089
She confronted him, he killed her?

29:17.137 --> 29:20.527
- No.
- You want to protect your husband.

29:20.577 --> 29:24.252
That woman showed up at the door,

29:24.297 --> 29:27.926
threatened him, threatened our routine.

29:27.977 --> 29:30.616
I knew what I had to do.

29:31.617 --> 29:33.926
And what was that?

29:33.977 --> 29:36.537
I calmed her down.

29:36.577 --> 29:38.886
I gave her tea.

29:40.257 --> 29:44.296
- You drugged her?
- With Beuthanasia as a chaser?

29:45.297 --> 29:48.289
Your idea or your husband's?

29:49.297 --> 29:53.688
It's like putting an animal down,
you have to disassociate.

29:55.297 --> 30:00.610
Mrs Morrow, did your husband tell you
to kill Constanta?

30:03.617 --> 30:06.609
He didn't have to tell me anything.

30:08.257 --> 30:11.613
Police! Last chance!

30:18.417 --> 30:20.612
You smell that? Upstairs.

30:27.057 --> 30:28.854
What are you doing?

30:31.737 --> 30:34.490
You have no right to be in here.

30:34.537 --> 30:38.496
Exigent circumstances.
Your lawyer will explain it to you.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.847
- Elliot!
- Yeah?

30:41.897 --> 30:45.446
- Look at this!
- We'll need warrants for those.

30:45.497 --> 30:47.886
Let's at least get him outta here.

30:48.937 --> 30:50.734
Where is she?

30:50.777 --> 30:53.245
She's gone. She's not coming back.

30:54.097 --> 30:55.894
Ilena!

30:56.737 --> 30:59.809
- Ilena!
- Ilena!

30:59.857 --> 31:01.848
Ilena, can you hear us?

31:03.737 --> 31:05.693
- Ilena?
- Olivia!

31:05.737 --> 31:08.695
Get me something. We got a padlock.

31:08.737 --> 31:10.614
That's good.

31:28.657 --> 31:30.693
Where is she?

31:30.737 --> 31:34.696
- Who?
- The girl you're torturing in those photos.

31:34.737 --> 31:37.205
Honey, I'd like a mineral water. No ice.

31:37.257 --> 31:40.886
I'd like your balls in a blender,
but ain't life a bitch?

31:40.937 --> 31:45.010
I said it'd be OK to keep me company
while I waited for my attorney

31:45.057 --> 31:47.525
but I'll have a little quiet time now.

31:50.817 --> 31:53.206
I've got some typing to catch up on.

31:58.537 --> 32:02.212
Maybe you shouldn't have
called her honey. Women!

32:02.257 --> 32:05.374
I've been trying to break her in
for a long time.

32:05.417 --> 32:07.373
I'd recommend the rack.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.056
- Sounds painful.
- It's excruciating.

32:10.097 --> 32:13.726
You can cut off circulation,
cause permanent damage.

32:13.777 --> 32:16.689
- Is that so?
- It has to be consensual.

32:16.737 --> 32:18.807
Like it is with Ilena.

32:21.697 --> 32:26.691
- Mr Morrow's attorney is here.
- Why is he talking to my client?

32:26.737 --> 32:31.652
It's all right, Terrence. We were
just discussing our common interest.

32:31.697 --> 32:34.416
Now, let's get me home in time for dinner.

32:36.817 --> 32:41.493
It gets worse. The hair sample
from the rug, not his. It's the wife's.

32:43.937 --> 32:46.735
- We need that warrant now.
- Let's go.

32:46.777 --> 32:48.608
What did you get from him?

32:48.657 --> 32:53.128
She's still alive. Kept using the present.
'She is' not 'was'.

32:53.177 --> 32:55.850
- We just gotta find her.
- Before she dies.

32:55.897 --> 32:59.890
- How do we know these pictures exist?
- The detectives saw them.

32:59.937 --> 33:02.895
- Where?
- When they entered his residence.

33:02.937 --> 33:06.009
- Without a warrant?
- Exigent circumstances.

33:06.057 --> 33:08.935
- They believed she was in danger.
- Was she?

33:08.977 --> 33:10.615
She wasn't on the premises,

33:10.657 --> 33:15.492
but they found evidence indicating
she'd been held against her will

33:15.537 --> 33:17.175
and that she'd been moved.

33:17.217 --> 33:18.855
- On this basis...
- Please.

33:18.897 --> 33:22.970
New York has more bondage shops
than you can crack a whip at.

33:23.017 --> 33:25.929
Whips don't denote non-consensual acts.

33:25.977 --> 33:29.128
Any idiot can see she's being held against...

33:29.177 --> 33:31.566
You are very close to contempt.

33:33.057 --> 33:36.015
We need to get into this apartment.

33:36.057 --> 33:40.653
You don't have probable cause
so you want a warrant so you can get it.

33:40.697 --> 33:43.086
Is that it? Nice try.

33:44.017 --> 33:45.814
All rise.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.529
- She's detoxing.
- From?

33:47.577 --> 33:49.613
Ketamine, an animal tranquilliser.

33:49.657 --> 33:52.046
On the street it's called Special K.

33:52.097 --> 33:56.966
To vets it's known as the addiction
of choice. And hers is pretty long-term.

33:59.617 --> 34:01.892
I already told you everything.

34:01.937 --> 34:05.566
We're not here for your crime.
We're here for your husband's.

34:05.617 --> 34:08.177
My husband didn't do anything wrong.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.650
He kidnapped and tortured that girl.

34:10.697 --> 34:14.656
He disciplined her. He helped her learn.

34:15.496 --> 34:18.216
Did you know that she was missing?

34:18.257 --> 34:24.253
You're gone. She's gone.
He's alone now, except for your daughter.

34:24.297 --> 34:25.696
And all his toys.

34:26.697 --> 34:31.690
He treats Tamara like a princess.
She is his daughter.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.774
Adopted daughter.
She's not flesh and blood.

34:34.817 --> 34:36.170
No, he wouldn't.

34:36.217 --> 34:38.525
He can't let that closet stay empty.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.855
- Who's the next logical choice?
- Forget logic. Who's convenient?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.208
You know he's gonna do it.

34:48.257 --> 34:50.725
He did it to you, didn't he? Didn't he?

34:57.737 --> 34:59.728
He was so...

35:00.737 --> 35:03.695
good to me at first.

35:04.737 --> 35:07.490
Then he started asking me to do things.

35:07.537 --> 35:09.732
So you let him hurt you?

35:09.777 --> 35:15.249
I wanted to escape so many times,
but I was so afraid for our daughter.

35:15.297 --> 35:19.893
So, you stayed hoping that things
would change, but they didn't?

35:22.017 --> 35:23.689
Until he abducted Ilena.

35:24.977 --> 35:27.810
He said it was so perfect.

35:27.857 --> 35:32.885
A woman just in the States and
nobody would even know she existed.

35:32.937 --> 35:36.054
He kept her in a closet
for the first six months.

35:36.097 --> 35:38.167
Except to rape and torture her.

35:38.217 --> 35:42.813
You have no idea what I went through.

35:42.857 --> 35:46.327
That's why you never did anything for Ilena.

35:48.737 --> 35:51.774
Because he stopped doing it to you.

35:54.617 --> 35:57.131
All right, you're gonna help us.

36:01.937 --> 36:06.215
- How easy was it to roll his wife?
- Like dice down the chute.

36:06.257 --> 36:09.647
She was your number-one submissive,
wasn't she?

36:09.697 --> 36:13.770
- She'll never testify against me.
- She will. We control her now.

36:13.817 --> 36:17.571
- She doesn't blink without my permission.
- She blinked.

36:17.617 --> 36:20.654
You broke her too much.
Made her too pliable.

36:20.697 --> 36:22.130
Made it easy for us.

36:22.177 --> 36:25.852
Most wives would die for their husbands,
but not yours.

36:25.897 --> 36:30.254
You screwed up. Your power's gone.
We took your control.

36:30.297 --> 36:35.052
I control Ilena! She doesn't eat or urinate
without my permission. I control her.

36:35.097 --> 36:37.053
I do.

36:37.097 --> 36:41.773
You like beating up women?
Huh, tough guy? Stand up.

36:44.497 --> 36:46.488
Sit down.

36:47.777 --> 36:49.574
Stand up.

36:49.617 --> 36:52.973
Stand up! Sit down! Sit down!

36:54.537 --> 36:57.131
Now who controls who?

36:57.177 --> 37:01.295
We forced every move you made.

37:01.337 --> 37:04.534
Once we start you running,
it's screw-up city.

37:04.577 --> 37:06.727
You never forced a move out of me.

37:06.777 --> 37:10.087
We forced you to move Ilena, didn't we?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.693
How about this one?

37:20.737 --> 37:24.332
That's the bathroom off the master suite.

37:24.377 --> 37:26.447
Look at these welts on her back.

37:26.497 --> 37:28.806
- Olivia!
- Did he break?

37:28.857 --> 37:33.453
No. Now we're sure all of these
pictures were taken in the house?

37:33.497 --> 37:36.887
Except for this one.
It's the only one I can't place.

37:36.937 --> 37:40.612
There's no point of reference
for location, just that rug.

37:40.657 --> 37:43.615
It's the rug Constanta was in!

37:43.657 --> 37:46.694
Where's the confession from his wife?

37:48.697 --> 37:52.053
- From the bedroom.
- She's been there all the time.

37:52.097 --> 37:54.895
Impossible!
The cops have been all over that place!

37:56.537 --> 37:58.846
There ain't nowhere else but here.

37:58.897 --> 38:01.855
Ilena, talk to us. Where are you?

38:02.857 --> 38:04.813
It's gotta be the bed.

38:04.857 --> 38:06.848
Here we go.

38:08.897 --> 38:11.650
Ilena, can you hear us?

38:11.697 --> 38:13.653
Olivia. Olivia.

38:13.697 --> 38:16.257
- What is it?
- I've no idea.

38:16.297 --> 38:18.288
Something there.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.288
- Come on.
- Come on.

38:22.297 --> 38:25.812
Elliot, there's something. Pull this. Pull it.

38:26.817 --> 38:30.014
Oh, my God! She's alive.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.089
Can you hear us? Call an ambulance!

38:34.137 --> 38:36.697
It's OK, sweetheart.

38:36.737 --> 38:40.855
This is Stabler at 321, West 101.
I need an ambulance now.

38:40.897 --> 38:43.092
321, West 101st.

38:43.137 --> 38:47.289
Tell him I didn't do anything.
I didn't make a sound, I swear.

38:47.337 --> 38:50.932
- I didn't do anything.
- It's OK. We'll get you out of here.

38:50.977 --> 38:54.936
It's over. It's over.
I didn't do anything.

38:54.977 --> 38:58.333
How long does a case like this
stay with you?

38:58.377 --> 39:00.333
A while.

39:00.377 --> 39:03.289
How do you deal with it?

39:07.297 --> 39:11.256
I go home, hug my kids, kiss my wife.

39:12.257 --> 39:14.566
You discuss the cases at home?

39:14.617 --> 39:17.654
No. I don't let that world touch my family.

39:17.697 --> 39:22.213
That world's everywhere.
You can't put them on 24-hour surveillance.

39:22.257 --> 39:25.215
That doesn't mean I have to be
their window into it.

39:27.217 --> 39:31.972
You, er, you have to work with
a lot of cases involving children.

39:32.017 --> 39:35.453
Do you think that hits a little close to home?

39:48.457 --> 39:53.326
You ever see a child... with no soul?

39:57.417 --> 39:58.816
I have.

40:00.897 --> 40:03.775
How do you handle it?

40:04.777 --> 40:08.167
I think. I think a lot.

40:09.177 --> 40:11.133
About?

40:11.177 --> 40:14.169
The crime. The victim. Er...

40:16.777 --> 40:19.735
The people that do that sort of thing.

40:19.777 --> 40:21.768
What else?

40:24.937 --> 40:28.134
How I could get away with killing them.

40:32.137 --> 40:35.732
- You have a minute?
- Yeah. Come on in.

40:36.777 --> 40:41.407
- How goes the witch-hunt?
- Well, I've seen everybody.

40:43.417 --> 40:46.966
You find any bed-wetters or cross-dressers?

40:47.017 --> 40:52.011
No. No, I've found a commensurate level
of stress and neurosis

40:52.057 --> 40:54.855
that one would expect in this work.

40:54.897 --> 40:56.888
For the most part.

40:58.297 --> 41:01.448
- For the most part?
- The purpose of this programme

41:01.497 --> 41:05.012
is to identify detectives that are close to
meltdown.

41:05.057 --> 41:10.006
It's to protect the public from them.
As well as themselves.

41:10.057 --> 41:13.254
You're saying you found someone
in my unit?

41:13.297 --> 41:18.212
I did. I'm afraid I have to recommend
that they be removed from duty.

41:18.257 --> 41:20.248
Immediately.

41:28.337 --> 41:30.328
Who?
