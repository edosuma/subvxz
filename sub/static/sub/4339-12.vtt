WEBVTT

00:03.373 --> 00:05.039
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
- The safety and security

00:05.041 --> 00:07.374
that only we can provide
comes at a cost.

00:07.376 --> 00:10.278
<i> We are going to give
you back</i> <i> your streets.</i>

00:10.304 --> 00:12.378
All of it. We fight
-- or we die.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.581
Don't let these monsters
take this from us.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.384
- They're gonna remember
this day... and you.

00:20.386 --> 00:23.653
- All residents of the Upper
East Side

00:23.655 --> 00:27.657
will contribute one percent of
their property value to the SSI.

00:27.659 --> 00:32.027
- Justine, you can't do this.
- Mayor, I just did.

00:32.029 --> 00:35.863
- We need a human soldier who
can move freely in the daylight.

00:35.865 --> 00:39.099
You have proven
yourself capable.

00:39.101 --> 00:39.926
- I'm listening.

00:39.952 --> 00:42.402
- I have always been in
love with you, and it has

00:42.404 --> 00:43.966
never made me happy!

00:43.992 --> 00:48.207
- So we go straight to
Washington, DC tomorrow morning.

00:48.209 --> 00:50.242
I found a way to kill them.
It's a bioweapon.

00:50.268 --> 00:51.843
It needs to be refined
but it works.

00:51.845 --> 00:54.445
- I have a contact at Kemerall.
- Oh yeah?

00:54.447 --> 00:57.848
Let's start with the train.
I did see Barnes. He saw me.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.383
We got into a fight and I'm the
one that threw him off.

01:00.385 --> 01:03.352
And all I managed to do
is get four people killed!

01:03.354 --> 01:05.721
- Four? Barnes?
- Rob,

01:05.723 --> 01:08.223
the man that was sent
to kill us,

01:08.225 --> 01:13.126
Leigh Thomas.
- I see.

01:14.762 --> 01:16.862
- (muffled):<i> Inefficiency in</i>
<i> antibiotic distribution could</i>

01:16.864 --> 01:21.132
<i>multiply the toll by as much as</i>
<i> seven times. Keep in mind</i>

01:21.134 --> 01:23.134
<i> that most US communities...</i>
- Did you find the part

01:23.136 --> 01:25.803
about the variola incubation
periods stimulating enough?

01:25.805 --> 01:30.207
- Riveting. I didn't understand
half of it, but it was sexy.

01:30.209 --> 01:33.076
Look, if somebody asks a less
than enlightened question,

01:33.078 --> 01:35.645
try not to be condescending.
- Condescending?

01:35.647 --> 01:37.913
- Yeah. You're gonna have
to accept the fact that

01:37.915 --> 01:41.082
not everyone is as smart as you.
- Asking somebody to clarify

01:41.084 --> 01:44.819
their thoughts is not condescending.
- Kinda is the way you do it.

01:44.821 --> 01:47.822
-<i> Would you please welcome...</i>
- Just throw in some of your natural charm,

01:47.824 --> 01:49.100
and everything will be fine.

01:49.126 --> 01:51.125
- Well, luckily I have
an abundance of that.

01:51.127 --> 01:53.460
- ...<i> Ephraim Goodweather.</i>
- That's your cue.

01:53.462 --> 01:55.462
Knock 'em dead, boss.

01:55.464 --> 01:57.464
(applause)

01:57.466 --> 01:59.732
- So as you can see,
the recent SARS outbreak

01:59.734 --> 02:02.134
caught us surprisingly
off-guard.

02:02.136 --> 02:05.003
We weren't ready for how fast
airliners would carry it

02:05.005 --> 02:07.438
across the world.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.340
We were lucky that SARS didn't
turn out to be as virulent

02:10.342 --> 02:13.076
as Lassa fever or Marburg.

02:13.078 --> 02:15.645
But the lesson is that
in our modern world,

02:15.647 --> 02:18.848
the time between the small
spark of a disease

02:18.850 --> 02:22.318
and our barn burning
down is very short.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.853
Thank you. I'll take some
questions now.

02:24.855 --> 02:28.289
Sir?
- How do you propose to prevent

02:28.291 --> 02:30.357
sick people from flying?
- Well, first of all,

02:30.359 --> 02:32.459
Homeland Security needs to get
off their ass and set up

02:32.461 --> 02:34.861
a national "Do Not Board" list.
- With incubation

02:34.863 --> 02:37.296
times far exceeding
travel times,

02:37.298 --> 02:40.599
wouldn't we have to track
passengers on arrival, too?

02:40.601 --> 02:43.768
- Absolutely. We'll need to
expand our quarantine facilities

02:43.770 --> 02:46.604
to cover all major ports of
entry into the States. And

02:46.606 --> 02:48.939
we'll need more quick-response
teams like Canary.

02:48.941 --> 02:51.608
- But it'll still be
a crapshoot, because you won't

02:51.610 --> 02:55.345
have any true control over whether
infected passengers will travel.

02:55.347 --> 02:57.547
- Do you have any better
suggestions?

02:57.549 --> 02:59.882
- Yes. Focus on vaccine
development.

02:59.884 --> 03:02.818
- Oh, you mean engage in an
entirely different crapshoot --

03:02.820 --> 03:05.654
'cause you'll just be guessing
which strain to defend against.

03:05.656 --> 03:08.690
And any successful mass
immunization effort will just

03:08.692 --> 03:11.192
trigger a huge political
fight, like it did with

03:11.194 --> 03:13.561
Swine Flu in '76.
- And yet that program

03:13.563 --> 03:16.697
prevented at least 1 million
cases in the US alone.

03:16.699 --> 03:18.865
- I can see we disagree
on tactics, but I'm sure

03:18.867 --> 03:21.734
we can all agree that if we just
sit back and rely on sheer luck

03:21.736 --> 03:24.269
to protect us, we'll be
courting disaster.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.740
And on that happy note,
let's go to lunch.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.709
(applause)

03:33.412 --> 03:35.345
- Sounds interesting.

03:35.347 --> 03:37.547
- You should make some time
to visit us at USAMRIID.

03:37.549 --> 03:40.049
Just an hour's drive up the 270.
- I'm flattered,

03:40.051 --> 03:42.518
but um, bioweapons --
not really my thing.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.587
- Actually, we're the first line of
defense against infectious disease...

03:45.589 --> 03:49.090
- Oh, shit. I'm about to
get my head chewed off.

03:49.092 --> 03:51.725
Excuse me.
- Sure.

03:56.063 --> 03:59.330
- Nora Martinez.
Ephraim Goodweather.

03:59.332 --> 04:02.266
- Nice to meet you. I hope
you didn't mind my questions.

04:02.268 --> 04:04.901
- Your boss, Gary Lazar, told me
to watch out for you.

04:04.903 --> 04:06.903
He said you were brilliant,

04:06.905 --> 04:10.106
but you were likely to
challenge all my assumptions.

04:10.108 --> 04:11.185
- Gary said that?

04:11.211 --> 04:14.176
- He said you were the
most brilliant biochemist

04:14.178 --> 04:16.711
in the entire CDC.

04:16.713 --> 04:20.781
How'd you like to work for me?

04:20.783 --> 04:24.751

Got it.

Thank you so much.

04:47.970 --> 04:50.169
We will.

05:04.415 --> 05:07.082
I gave her Zack's info,
and Kelly's parents

05:07.084 --> 05:09.818
contacted the centre yesterday.
- From where?

05:09.820 --> 05:13.420
- Sea Island, Georgia. They're
gonna call here in 20 minutes.

05:13.422 --> 05:15.488
- So they're OK?

05:15.490 --> 05:18.123
Dad, we should go there.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.092
We'll be safe.

05:21.094 --> 05:23.294
- Let's see what they say.
Find out what the situation is.

05:23.296 --> 05:25.663
OK?
- OK.

05:25.665 --> 05:28.198
- Finish your breakfast.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.472
- I can't take him
to his grandparents.

05:37.474 --> 05:40.074
- Why not?
- Running is not the solution.

05:40.076 --> 05:41.975
We just need to rethink this.

05:41.977 --> 05:45.511
The bioweapon works. We need
a new plan to scale it up.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.613
- Yeah, but where does
that leave Zack?

05:47.615 --> 05:50.649
We can't just park him at home
while we're out fighting.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.518
You had no other options

05:53.520 --> 05:57.255
for Zack. Now you do.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.827
(theme music)

06:45.304 --> 06:48.171
- Yo! Anybody home?

06:48.173 --> 06:50.606
Special delivery!

06:54.912 --> 06:57.278
Plan B?

06:59.181 --> 07:01.314

07:19.433 --> 07:22.400
We're here to kill them,
not bless them.

07:22.402 --> 07:25.770
I'm just saying.

07:42.421 --> 07:45.121
- Hello? Nana?

07:46.858 --> 07:50.625
Yeah. It's Zack.
Fine.

07:50.627 --> 07:53.194
It's great to hear your voice.

07:53.196 --> 07:56.063
Really great.

07:56.065 --> 07:59.699
(voice breaking): I'm fine--

08:03.037 --> 08:05.203
I miss you too.

08:07.073 --> 08:09.273
So much.

08:17.782 --> 08:20.783
Just one second, OK?

08:20.785 --> 08:23.385
- It's OK, it's OK.

08:23.387 --> 08:25.587
(soft crying)

08:25.589 --> 08:27.722
You've held it in
for a long time.

08:33.629 --> 08:35.895
- What's the problem?
- Did I say there was a problem?

08:35.897 --> 08:37.930
- You didn't have to.
That thing with your eyebrows?

08:37.932 --> 08:39.932
When you're upset?
- I'm not upset.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.900
I just wish you had consulted me
before offering her a job.

08:41.902 --> 08:44.269
- I'm consulting you now.
It's not written in stone.

08:44.271 --> 08:46.971
You don't think she's qualified?
- She's abundantly qualified.

08:46.973 --> 08:48.973
- What, is it because she's
so confrontational?

08:48.975 --> 08:52.242
'Cause I actually think that's a plus.
- So do I.

08:52.244 --> 08:54.143
- Wait...

08:54.145 --> 08:57.012
Is it because she's so attractive?
- Oh, you noticed that, did you?

08:57.014 --> 08:59.247
- Of course. But that won't
be a distraction, will it?

08:59.249 --> 09:00.158
- You brought it up.

09:00.184 --> 09:02.583
- No, no, I just said out
loud what you were thinking.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.352
- Oh. By the way, how are
things going with Kelly?

09:05.354 --> 09:07.587
Does she still want you quit the
field and take that desk job?

09:07.589 --> 09:10.122
- You're unbelievable.
You actually think I would hire

09:10.124 --> 09:12.124
Nora Martinez 'cause I'm
frustrated with Kelly?

09:12.126 --> 09:15.961
- Well, I'm glad to see that the
possibility never even crossed your mind.

09:15.963 --> 09:18.330
- What are you,
the morality police?

09:18.332 --> 09:20.832
Hey, I know how to
separate my personal

09:20.834 --> 09:22.934
and my professional
relationships!

09:22.936 --> 09:25.169
(loud drone)

09:29.541 --> 09:32.375
- Morning.

09:35.780 --> 09:39.281
How you feeling?
- Better.

09:39.283 --> 09:41.182
- Good.

09:41.184 --> 09:44.385
- Uh, um.

09:44.387 --> 09:46.387
I was about to write you a note.

09:46.389 --> 09:49.056
Um, couldn't figure out

09:49.058 --> 09:51.525
exactly how to say

09:51.527 --> 09:53.527
what I wanted to say.

09:53.529 --> 09:56.530
- Good thing I'm here.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.971
(sigh)
- I, um...

10:05.973 --> 10:08.840
I really thought that I was
going to die in there.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.009
That finally I'd gotten
myself into something

10:12.011 --> 10:15.078
that I couldn't get out of.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.313
And then you came.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.515
- Why wouldn't I?

10:19.517 --> 10:22.251
- Because I have been such
an utter shit to you.

10:22.253 --> 10:24.686
- Yeah.

10:24.688 --> 10:27.221
That's no reason
to let you die, is it?

10:28.891 --> 10:32.192
- Oh, God. You're such
a better person than I am.

10:32.194 --> 10:35.762
- Aren't you being a little
hard on yourself?

10:35.764 --> 10:39.232
- Am I? Because I'm about
to walk out on a man

10:39.234 --> 10:41.433
who risked his life for me.

10:43.236 --> 10:46.570
Who knows exactly who I am.

10:46.572 --> 10:48.905
And who loves me anyway.

10:57.548 --> 10:59.747
I'm gonna be with Nikki.

11:02.017 --> 11:05.818
I have to try to make
something real with her.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.988
- I hope you do.

11:13.059 --> 11:15.859
I want that for you.

11:17.562 --> 11:20.095
- You don't make it
easy, do you?

11:26.902 --> 11:29.135
- Nothing good comes easy.

11:49.556 --> 11:51.889
- (man): So basically we have to
barricade this way before we

11:51.891 --> 11:54.725
even get to the subways.
- Have we closed the subways?

11:54.727 --> 11:56.793
- We're getting to that.
- Alright.

11:56.795 --> 11:59.095
- Justine!

11:59.097 --> 12:02.131
- Have a seat, George.
- What in hell are you thinking?

12:02.133 --> 12:05.467
I told you not to extort those people
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

12:05.469 --> 12:07.802
- You also told me

12:07.804 --> 12:10.437
to drive the plague
out of New York.

12:10.439 --> 12:14.274
I need cops to get the job done.
And cops expect to get paid.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.644
- With loot stolen
from the citizens

12:17.646 --> 12:20.179
they're sworn to protect?
- It's a tax --

12:20.181 --> 12:23.849
like any other tax --
for public services.

12:23.851 --> 12:27.352
My officers are putting their
lives on the line

12:27.354 --> 12:29.253
every night. They have families!

12:29.255 --> 12:31.822
- I didn't come here
to debate you.

12:31.824 --> 12:34.157
I want your letter
of resignation

12:34.159 --> 12:36.092
on my desk tomorrow morning,

12:36.094 --> 12:40.229
or I will instruct
the DA to indict you.

12:42.466 --> 12:44.532
- After everything
she's done for the city?

12:44.534 --> 12:46.500
You ungrateful piece of--

12:46.502 --> 12:48.702
- Here. Call the DA right now.

12:48.704 --> 12:51.838
Meanwhile, I'll take this
to the City Council.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.806
- Way ahead of you.

12:53.808 --> 12:57.342
I've already spoken with
Bernstein and Morello.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.645
They both agree that
you need to step down,

13:00.647 --> 13:03.213
and the rest of the council
will follow their lead.

13:05.483 --> 13:08.484
- Captain Kowalski,
please remove the Mayor

13:08.486 --> 13:10.552
from the premises.

13:10.554 --> 13:12.720
- With pleasure.

13:12.722 --> 13:16.190
Come on, let's go--
- Get your hands off me.

13:18.794 --> 13:21.661
You're fighting on my turf now.

13:21.663 --> 13:23.896
You won't be so lucky.

13:36.042 --> 13:39.076
(seagulls squawking)

13:43.014 --> 13:46.081
(lights buzzing)

14:09.906 --> 14:12.673
- (whispering):
Anybody out there?

14:18.780 --> 14:20.880
- If it isn't El Pisaro.

14:20.882 --> 14:23.215
You comfortable in there, man?

14:23.217 --> 14:27.352
Can I get you something?
- Elizalde? Is that you?

14:27.354 --> 14:29.454
- You know this guy?

14:29.456 --> 14:33.391
- He used to like to get you away from
the security cameras and beat you down.

14:33.393 --> 14:35.726
- It wasn't personal.
- Naw, I know, I know.

14:35.728 --> 14:37.728
You were just
doing your job, right?

14:37.730 --> 14:40.297
- Please. I've been trapped
in here for days

14:40.299 --> 14:42.532
without food. Get me out.

14:42.534 --> 14:46.369
- I'm going to need your
ID card to open the lock.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.778
- Hey.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.845
Hey, hey wait!

15:01.149 --> 15:03.449
You can't just leave me here!

15:03.451 --> 15:06.718
- You don't tell me what I can
and what I can't do.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.720
Not anymore.

15:08.722 --> 15:11.255
- No, no, no. No!
You can't leave me here.

15:11.257 --> 15:14.224
No! I gave you the badge. Wait!

15:37.248 --> 15:40.415
(beep)

15:40.417 --> 15:44.685
(beeps)

15:44.687 --> 15:47.120
(buzzing)

15:47.122 --> 15:49.889
(men exclaiming)

15:53.461 --> 15:55.327
- Perez!

15:55.329 --> 15:58.797
Perez, you alive?
- Elizalde?

15:58.799 --> 16:02.633
What the hell you doing here?
- I'm here to get you out.

16:02.635 --> 16:06.003
- Best idea I heard all day.

16:06.005 --> 16:09.039
(indistinct discussion)

16:12.377 --> 16:14.944
- Could have used some
of these three days ago.

16:14.946 --> 16:17.680
- From what I saw on the way in,
it's a good thing the CO locked

16:17.682 --> 16:20.749
you guys up. You're the only
ones that didn't get infected.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.322
(whistle)
- Silver? Classy.

16:27.324 --> 16:30.658
So if we fight for this guy
of yours, this Quinlan,

16:30.660 --> 16:33.861
he can supply more of this shit?
- Everything we need.

16:33.863 --> 16:36.563
- But why we gotta take orders?
- 'Cause he knows how to win

16:36.565 --> 16:39.299
against these things.
He made us a deal.

16:39.301 --> 16:42.669
We work with him,
we can own this city.

16:42.671 --> 16:44.971
(men assenting)
- You saying

16:44.973 --> 16:45.815
he can be reasonable?

16:45.841 --> 16:48.074
- What I'm saying is, the man
doesn't care about material

16:48.076 --> 16:51.343
things. Anything we grab
on the way out

16:51.345 --> 16:54.145
we can keep.
(men exclaiming)

16:54.147 --> 16:57.414
- Then what are we waiting for?
- Stay quiet.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.649
I don't want us to
have to fight on the way out.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.151
I don't want to lose anybody
that we don't have to.

17:02.153 --> 17:04.720
(guns cocking)

17:11.728 --> 17:14.862
- Councilwoman Feraldo's really
getting the word out, huh?

17:14.864 --> 17:17.264
- "Homeland."

17:17.266 --> 17:19.266
"Fatherland."

17:19.268 --> 17:21.268
When politicians
use these words,

17:21.270 --> 17:25.405
it usually precedes
murder on a grand scale.

17:33.548 --> 17:35.748
- They're here now.

17:41.554 --> 17:44.288
Go on. He's expecting you.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.456
Let 'em pass.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.263
(hip hop music plays)

18:00.404 --> 18:03.705
- (man): I got eyes on them
in the courtyard.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.207
- (Fet): Pretty good security.

18:06.209 --> 18:08.742
You get a lot of munchers
coming up from the subway?

18:08.744 --> 18:11.144
- Closed it off.

18:11.146 --> 18:13.212
- That's very smart.

18:13.214 --> 18:15.981
- Nobody goes on
or off this island

18:15.983 --> 18:18.583
without Creem's say-so.

18:18.585 --> 18:20.451
Your cane.

18:20.453 --> 18:23.654
Creem said you should hand it
over -- for safekeeping.

18:27.325 --> 18:32.461
(indistinct conversation)

18:32.463 --> 18:35.230
(laughing and clapping)

18:35.232 --> 18:37.732
- Good to see you, old man.

18:37.734 --> 18:40.301
Ooh. You sure you don't
want to sell this?

18:40.303 --> 18:43.237
- The<i> Occido Lumen.</i>

18:43.239 --> 18:45.672
If you really have it,
I want to see it.

18:45.674 --> 18:47.940
- Right to the point.
I like that.

18:47.942 --> 18:50.842
(snapping)
(music stops)

18:55.514 --> 18:58.414
- May I?
- Oh, by all means.

19:06.924 --> 19:10.925
(Fet whistles)
- All that silver...

19:10.927 --> 19:14.194
give a muncher
a hell of a burn, huh?

19:14.196 --> 19:16.529
- That was the intention.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.897
- Those suckers
hate silver, huh?

19:20.767 --> 19:23.501
Guess I picked the right bling.
Can bite 'em all back.

19:23.503 --> 19:26.504
(laughing)

19:32.444 --> 19:36.946
So is it the real deal?

19:36.948 --> 19:39.848
- It would be
impossible to forge

19:39.850 --> 19:42.784
to match the parchment,

19:42.786 --> 19:44.819
the colouring,

19:44.821 --> 19:47.221
the quality,

19:47.223 --> 19:49.756
the oak gall ink.

19:52.794 --> 19:55.027
Yes, Mr. Creem.

19:55.029 --> 19:58.130
It's genuine.

19:58.132 --> 20:01.032
- Here, take it.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.000
- And this...

20:03.002 --> 20:06.536
completes our transaction.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.671
- I'm afraid not.

20:08.673 --> 20:12.540
We have another player.
Eldritch Palmer.

20:15.244 --> 20:18.178
- Mr. Creem, I will use the book

20:18.180 --> 20:21.514
to end this plague.
Palmer will not.

20:21.516 --> 20:24.850
- He wants the book so that
nobody can stop it.

20:24.852 --> 20:27.652
- Yeah, this apocalypse
has been very good to me.

20:27.654 --> 20:30.721
I mean, hell, look.
I even got my own island.

20:30.723 --> 20:33.857
- This is why
the<i> strigoi</i> are winning.

20:33.859 --> 20:37.260
They're counting on humanity
to take short-term profits

20:37.262 --> 20:39.528
and to hell with the
long-term consequences!

20:39.530 --> 20:44.499
- If you're accusing me of being
human, I'm guilty as charged.

20:49.105 --> 20:51.405
- Give me 24 hours, and I will

20:51.407 --> 20:53.607
beat Mr. Palmer's offer.

20:57.078 --> 20:59.445
- Fair enough.

20:59.447 --> 21:02.381
Both of you can meet here
tomorrow, can bid it out.

21:02.383 --> 21:05.751
Man with the deepest pocket
wins. And leave the timepiece.

21:05.753 --> 21:08.787
The last Patek 1563

21:08.789 --> 21:11.222
went for 1.57 million.

21:11.224 --> 21:13.524
I'll credit this to your
account. And the rest of the

21:13.526 --> 21:15.559
funds must be paid in gold.

21:15.561 --> 21:17.927
- Gold?

21:20.464 --> 21:22.664
- Tomorrow then.

21:30.140 --> 21:33.107
(quiet voices)
- (whispering): Hey!

21:33.109 --> 21:36.743
Elizalde!
- (distant man): What's going on, man?

21:36.745 --> 21:39.946
- Get them to the bus.
- Follow me.

21:39.948 --> 21:42.882
- For Chrissake, let me out!
- Shut up! You're gonna wake

21:42.884 --> 21:45.684
up every vampire in this place.
- OK.

21:49.122 --> 21:52.123
(beep)

21:52.125 --> 21:54.125
Thanks, man.

21:54.127 --> 21:56.160
- Who the hell's that?

21:56.162 --> 21:59.296
-<i> Mira --</i> El Pisaro!
- We're all the

21:59.298 --> 22:01.965
same, man. I can help you out.
- Payback time.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.901
- No, no! Right now is not the
time; you're gonna wake them up.

22:04.903 --> 22:07.336
- So what?
(gunshot)

22:07.338 --> 22:10.739
(slicing)
(yelling)

22:16.579 --> 22:18.979
- Pigs bleed too!
(shrieking)

22:18.981 --> 22:23.583
- What the-- (gunshot) (squeal)

22:23.585 --> 22:26.485
(gunshots)
(growling)

22:26.487 --> 22:29.654
- Come on, keep moving.
Let's go!

22:44.336 --> 22:47.370
Let's go! We got 'em all.

22:53.344 --> 22:55.210
There's our ride.

22:55.212 --> 22:57.512
- So we can work for this
Quinlan, like<i> braceros?</i>

22:57.514 --> 23:01.282
Don't think so.
I make these calls --

23:01.284 --> 23:03.817
not you.

23:03.819 --> 23:05.885
Thanks for the weapons,

23:05.887 --> 23:08.454
but--
(gunshot)

23:18.999 --> 23:21.232
- Anyone else?

23:21.234 --> 23:23.667
- Now, the rest of you
can stay here with him

23:23.669 --> 23:26.302
or you can get on the bus.

23:35.713 --> 23:37.713
- How's he doing?

23:37.715 --> 23:40.215
(sigh)

23:40.217 --> 23:44.218
- All throughout family therapy
and the custody battle,

23:44.220 --> 23:46.987
all I wanted to do
was get him back.

23:46.989 --> 23:49.889
Make up for all the
time I wasn't there.

23:49.891 --> 23:53.058
Now I've got him back
and none of that's happening.

24:02.435 --> 24:06.036
- Where are you going?
- Councilwoman Feraldo's.

24:06.038 --> 24:09.272
If anybody can get a permit to get
Zack out of the city, it's her.

24:09.274 --> 24:11.440
- He'll be safer with
his grandparents.

24:11.442 --> 24:16.077
But he'll miss you terribly.
Have no doubt about that.

24:28.090 --> 24:32.959
- Have you found the<i> Lumen?</i>
- Yes.

24:35.897 --> 24:38.397
- Continue.

24:38.399 --> 24:41.566
- Tomorrow the<i> Lumen</i>
goes on sale

24:41.568 --> 24:43.601
to the highest bidder.

24:43.603 --> 24:45.803
I need the Ancients to back me.

24:45.805 --> 24:48.037
With gold.

24:50.107 --> 24:53.908
- The gold will not be an issue,
but they'll be reluctant

24:53.910 --> 24:56.210
to trust you with
the power of the<i> Lumen.</i>

24:57.746 --> 25:00.446
You could use it against them.
- True. But

25:00.448 --> 25:02.648
the Ancients must now decide

25:02.650 --> 25:05.050
who is the greater threat --

25:05.052 --> 25:08.319
an old pawnbroker
with a few confederates

25:08.321 --> 25:11.822
or the Master, backed
by Palmer and his billions.

25:11.824 --> 25:13.824
One thing is certain.

25:13.826 --> 25:17.894
If the Master obtains the book,
he will destroy us all.

25:24.335 --> 25:28.269
- It seems we have no choice
but to trust one another.

25:28.271 --> 25:31.972
- I will obtain the book.

25:31.974 --> 25:34.774
After I've examined it, I'll

25:34.776 --> 25:37.476
turn it over to the Ancients.

25:37.478 --> 25:40.579
- Agreed.

25:40.581 --> 25:41.736
- What about Cohen?

25:41.762 --> 25:44.682
- I left three messages.
He hasn't returned them.

25:44.684 --> 25:47.584
- If we don't have Cohen,
we're in deep shit.

25:47.586 --> 25:50.687
- Councilwoman Feraldo.
Detective Paul Sampson, NYPD.

25:50.689 --> 25:53.690
I need to ask you
a few questions.

25:53.692 --> 25:57.994
- Did the mayor send you?
- The mayor's dead.

26:03.868 --> 26:06.068
- Jesus.

26:07.805 --> 26:10.138
You said he was shot
in the mansion.

26:10.140 --> 26:12.173
Where the hell was
his security detail?

26:12.175 --> 26:15.376
- They were outside.
They found his body.

26:15.378 --> 26:18.679
His wallet and his watch
were missing,

26:18.681 --> 26:22.616
along with some valuables
from an upstairs bedroom.

26:22.618 --> 26:24.985
- But no one's buying
that it was a robbery.

26:24.987 --> 26:27.153
- Lyle's assistant said that you

26:27.155 --> 26:31.056
and the mayor exchanged
some words this morning?

26:31.058 --> 26:33.458
- He threatened to
fire me, and I had him

26:33.460 --> 26:35.359
thrown out of my office. Yes.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.194
- What I heard was he wanted
to have you indicted.

26:39.897 --> 26:42.297
- I knew the man
for over two decades.

26:42.299 --> 26:44.666
We exchanged a lotta threats.
But I sure as shit

26:44.668 --> 26:48.969
didn't kill him. We would have
resolved our issues.

26:48.971 --> 26:51.204
We always did.

26:53.241 --> 26:55.908
- You know, some people think

26:55.910 --> 26:58.911
they can take advantage
of the chaos in this city.

26:58.913 --> 27:01.546
Get away with anything.

27:01.548 --> 27:05.048
Not on my watch.

27:07.519 --> 27:10.720
- You mind if I have
a few minutes here?

27:10.722 --> 27:12.855
We worked together a long time.

27:12.857 --> 27:16.925
- Suit yourself.
I'll be outside.

27:18.728 --> 27:20.994
(door opening and closing)

27:20.996 --> 27:23.029
- Can you believe that prick?

27:23.031 --> 27:24.997
- Did you do this, Frank?

27:24.999 --> 27:27.165
- What?! No!

27:27.167 --> 27:29.534
- Did you get someone
else to do it?

27:29.536 --> 27:32.069
- No.

27:32.071 --> 27:34.204
- So none of our people
were involved.

27:34.206 --> 27:36.206
- Not as far as I know.

27:36.208 --> 27:39.242
- Find out!

27:49.887 --> 27:53.020
(radio chattering)

27:55.591 --> 27:59.292
- You have to admire it.
This took vision.

27:59.294 --> 28:01.727
- Mr. Palmer. Sorry
to keep you waiting.

28:01.729 --> 28:05.297
Glad to finally meet you.
How is your assistant doing?

28:05.299 --> 28:07.766
- Oh, a couple of inches
one way, and the bullet

28:07.768 --> 28:09.701
would've killed her. But
she's going to make a quick

28:09.703 --> 28:12.570
and full recovery.
- Glad to hear it.

28:12.572 --> 28:16.373
If you've come here to convince
me to resign, take a number.

28:16.375 --> 28:19.042
- No, on the contrary, I'm here
because Mayor Lyle's

28:19.044 --> 28:22.278
tragic death has left the city
in even worse chaos.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.980
New York needs a strong leader.

28:24.982 --> 28:27.949
And I think that leader is you.

28:27.951 --> 28:30.785
- There are a lot of people

28:30.787 --> 28:33.554
on the City Council who
would disagree with you.

28:33.556 --> 28:36.056
- Well, I've been on the phone
with the leadership all morning.

28:36.058 --> 28:39.225
I believe you have
tremendous support.

28:39.227 --> 28:42.727
In fact, this afternoon,

28:42.729 --> 28:44.729
at my urging,

28:44.731 --> 28:47.565
Councilman Cohen will
introduce a resolution

28:47.567 --> 28:49.967
to have you appointed
Special Director of Security

28:49.969 --> 28:53.236
for New York City, in charge
of waging all-out war

28:53.238 --> 28:56.305
on this terrible plague.

28:56.307 --> 28:58.940
- Why the sudden impulse
to help me?

28:58.942 --> 29:01.943
- I need a strong partner
at City Hall.

29:01.945 --> 29:04.812
We're both fighting
to save this city.

29:04.814 --> 29:07.114
Together I believe we
can get the job done.

29:07.116 --> 29:09.316
- Yeah,<i> kumbaya.</i>
Let's hear the rest.

29:09.318 --> 29:13.019
- Well, going forward, you're
going to need tools to fight.

29:13.021 --> 29:15.621
- Just like you did
for the Pentagon?

29:15.623 --> 29:18.357
Stoneheart provided our troops

29:18.359 --> 29:20.992
with $300 toilet seats.

29:20.994 --> 29:23.928
Then there was that
base in Iraq.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.430
Cost you $30 million
to construct,

29:26.432 --> 29:28.698
and you charged the government
$300 million for it.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.367
- Yes, when this is over,

29:31.369 --> 29:33.669
I shall be even richer.

29:33.671 --> 29:37.139
But I also intend to win.

29:37.141 --> 29:39.774
Are you interested?

29:43.612 --> 29:45.545
(crowd shouting)
- Feraldo's a fascist!

29:45.547 --> 29:47.947
- Take two steps back!
- Excuse me.

29:47.949 --> 29:50.215
- Move it! Move it!
- Hey, take it easy, buddy.

29:50.217 --> 29:52.150
Come on, move back. Move back.

29:52.152 --> 29:54.652
- We're here to see Feraldo.
- Get back!

29:54.654 --> 29:57.621
- Ask Captain Kowalski.
- There he is.

29:59.491 --> 30:01.491
- Let 'em through.
- Let's go, let's go.

30:01.493 --> 30:04.727
Back up! Move it!
(hubbub)

30:04.729 --> 30:08.130
- Quiet! Quiet, please!

30:08.132 --> 30:11.566
Quiet in the chamber, please!

30:11.568 --> 30:15.369
The final tally is 38 to 13

30:15.371 --> 30:17.204
in favour of the Enabling Act.

30:17.206 --> 30:20.473
- This makes a mockery of our democracy!
- Councilman.

30:20.475 --> 30:22.408
- We will challenge
this in court!

30:22.410 --> 30:24.676
The people won't stand for this!

30:24.678 --> 30:27.912
It's unconstitutional!
You fascist!

30:27.914 --> 30:31.849
- And now, it is
my honour to present

30:31.851 --> 30:35.318
our new Special Director
of Security, Justine Feraldo!

30:35.320 --> 30:38.421
(applause)

30:44.162 --> 30:47.329
- Thank you, fellow members.
Apparently, Councilman

30:47.331 --> 30:50.065
Bernstein feels passionate
about his civil rights.

30:50.067 --> 30:52.600
And I understand that.

30:52.602 --> 30:55.569
But you know what I feel
passionate about?

30:55.571 --> 30:59.339
The right of every
New Yorker to be free

30:59.341 --> 31:02.408
from this vile menace
that grips our city.

31:02.410 --> 31:05.377
(cheering)

31:05.379 --> 31:07.278
No more!

31:07.280 --> 31:10.114
I will be damned if I'm going to
let any more of these things

31:10.116 --> 31:12.216
take our children,

31:12.218 --> 31:14.851
our mothers, fathers and
neighbours. No, goddamn it!

31:14.853 --> 31:16.853
I'm going to stop
these bastards.

31:16.855 --> 31:19.956
By whatever means necessary.
(applause)

31:19.958 --> 31:23.692
Until each and every one of those
bastards is dead on the ground!

31:23.694 --> 31:25.627
- She's incredible.

31:25.629 --> 31:28.129
- A vast improvement
over our mayor.

31:28.131 --> 31:32.065
- But can you control her?

31:32.067 --> 31:35.268
- Well, you let me worry
about Feraldo.

31:37.872 --> 31:40.272
- You're looking much
better, my dear.

31:40.274 --> 31:44.909
The white has brought a new
blush to your cheeks.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.381
- The<i> Lumen</i> will be
auctioned off tomorrow.

31:47.407 --> 31:48.479
We need to prepare.

31:48.481 --> 31:51.448
- Whatever do you mean?
- Setrakian will be there.

31:51.450 --> 31:54.484
When I outbid him, he
and his confederates will

31:54.486 --> 31:56.486
certainly try to take
the book from me.

31:56.488 --> 31:59.288
- For that very reason, the
Master cannot entrust

31:59.290 --> 32:01.290
such an important task to you.

32:01.292 --> 32:04.226
I will be attending the auction.
- No, no.

32:04.228 --> 32:06.394
Not with my resources,
you won't!

32:06.396 --> 32:08.929
- That's the way
the Master wants it.

32:08.931 --> 32:11.097
- Don't agree to this, Eldritch.

32:11.099 --> 32:13.766
- Ungrateful whore.

32:13.768 --> 32:17.502
If you do not
appreciate his gift,

32:17.504 --> 32:19.437
I can easily reclaim it.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.939
- Misogynistic son of a bitch.
If you dare touch her--

32:21.941 --> 32:24.574
- You'll do what?
- Harm one hair of her head,

32:24.576 --> 32:26.576
you will not get one
ounce of gold from me.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.312
- The Master saved your life,
Eldritch, as well as hers.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.648
Do you not remember this?
If you do not provide the funds

32:32.650 --> 32:36.351
for the<i> Lumen,</i> you will never
get another drop of the white.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.825
Oh!

32:50.498 --> 32:53.265
You thought its effects

32:53.267 --> 32:55.500
are permanent.

33:00.807 --> 33:03.740
Sorry to disappoint you.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.776
If you don't get more soon,

33:07.778 --> 33:10.011
you shall wither and die.

33:15.984 --> 33:17.950
- All right,

33:17.952 --> 33:20.619
we've established that
we all need each other

33:20.621 --> 33:24.388
and that we are united
by a common goal.

33:24.390 --> 33:26.656
- Exactly.

33:26.658 --> 33:30.860
We must not allow petty

33:30.862 --> 33:33.195
differences to divide us

33:33.197 --> 33:35.964
when victory is
within our grasp.

33:35.966 --> 33:39.400
- Absolutely.
- See to it that funding's

33:39.402 --> 33:42.369
in place tomorrow morning.
Agreed?

33:42.371 --> 33:45.772
- Consider it done.

33:56.884 --> 33:59.351
- He's playing you.

33:59.353 --> 34:02.320
- Of course.

34:02.322 --> 34:05.122
There is much more to come.

34:22.741 --> 34:25.441
- Is she here?
(gasp)

34:28.512 --> 34:32.247
- Yeah, she's inside.

34:32.249 --> 34:36.317
Please, she has a chance for
a better life. Let it happen.

34:45.961 --> 34:49.895
Here, I'll take that.

34:49.897 --> 34:52.063
- Where are you going?

34:52.065 --> 34:54.632
- Mom's friend got us papers
to get out of the city.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.267
- So you were just
going to disappear?

34:59.537 --> 35:01.904
Not even a note?
- Like the one you left me?

35:01.906 --> 35:04.306
"On a job.
Back tonight, I hope."

35:04.308 --> 35:08.610
I waited. Two days;
not a word from you.

35:08.612 --> 35:10.878
- I was arrested.

35:13.816 --> 35:17.217
Let's go home.
- Home?

35:17.219 --> 35:20.553
What home? To that apartment
you've appropriated?

35:20.555 --> 35:23.722
God only knows what happened to
the woman who was living there.

35:23.724 --> 35:26.458
There's this tragedy everywhere,
and you want to play house.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.761
- I am not playing.
- Mom, can you leave us alone,

35:29.763 --> 35:32.563
please?

35:38.837 --> 35:41.237
- You asked me to make a choice.

35:41.239 --> 35:44.406
I chose you.
- Listen to me.

35:44.408 --> 35:47.675
I can't sit at home
and wait for you anymore.

35:47.677 --> 35:50.778
- OK, OK.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.813
Then we'll stay home together.

35:52.815 --> 35:56.183
- Come on, you don't stay home.

35:56.185 --> 35:58.151
It's impossible.

35:58.153 --> 36:00.419
You've found something you
believe in: this fight.

36:00.421 --> 36:02.320
But it's not my fight.

36:02.322 --> 36:05.489
- Has she brainwashed you?

36:05.491 --> 36:08.592
- It's not her.

36:08.594 --> 36:10.760
This is all me.

36:31.848 --> 36:33.814
- (Feraldo): A bioweapon?

36:33.816 --> 36:35.849
- (Ephraim): We already tested
it on a<i> strigoi.</i>

36:35.851 --> 36:37.817
It infected more
than a dozen others.

36:37.819 --> 36:39.985
- (Nora): All of them died.
- If we can get the tools

36:39.987 --> 36:43.355
to mass produce this, you could
kill every<i> strigoi</i> in the city.

36:43.357 --> 36:45.990
- Then the rest of the country.
You could be the person

36:45.992 --> 36:47.992
who ends this plague.

36:47.994 --> 36:50.027
- What do you think, Frank?

36:50.029 --> 36:51.962
- What do you need from us?

36:51.964 --> 36:55.065
- A bio-reaction facility,
and your teams to help disperse

36:55.067 --> 36:58.034
the agent once we make it.
- I can do that. Thanks

36:58.036 --> 36:59.093
for bringing this to me.

36:59.119 --> 37:01.037
- Thank you. We have one
more favour to ask.

37:01.039 --> 37:03.305
Two travel permits and two
tickets to go to D.C.

37:03.307 --> 37:05.640
to get the reacting agent.
Then I'll drop my son off

37:05.642 --> 37:08.075
with his grandparents
and come back.

37:08.077 --> 37:10.877
- Three travel
permits and tickets.

37:10.879 --> 37:13.411
- Done.

37:15.748 --> 37:18.014
- I'm coming with you. I want to

37:18.016 --> 37:20.282
make sure Zack
gets there safely.

37:24.153 --> 37:27.887
(laughter)
(cutlery clinking)

37:27.889 --> 37:30.356
- Have I told you

37:30.358 --> 37:32.358
how much I love you?

37:32.360 --> 37:36.161
(chuckling)

37:36.163 --> 37:39.197
Don't laugh. I'm serious.
It's not funny.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.933
Come on. I mean,
we're like family.

37:41.935 --> 37:45.102
Right? Closer than my family.

37:45.104 --> 37:47.404
Surely better than them.

37:47.406 --> 37:51.508
- Of course we are. It took you
all this time to figure that out.

37:51.510 --> 37:54.911
- No. It took me a bottle and a half
of wine for me to say it out loud.

37:54.913 --> 37:57.246
- I think you've
had enough, partner.

37:57.248 --> 37:59.848
- Oh, well, if that isn't
the cat calling the pottle

37:59.850 --> 38:02.116
black or whatever...

38:04.920 --> 38:07.887
- You OK there, champ?

38:07.889 --> 38:10.088
- Here, have some water.

38:11.958 --> 38:16.860
- Uh-uh. You know what?

38:16.862 --> 38:19.996
You two look great together.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.999
- I'll call Sylvia.

38:27.437 --> 38:30.638
- Thanks.
- I was wrong, Eph.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.940
- What about?
- About Nora.

38:32.942 --> 38:36.576
Man, if she makes you happy,

38:36.578 --> 38:39.412
go for it.

38:39.414 --> 38:42.581
Everyone deserves to be happy.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.749
Even you.

38:44.751 --> 38:48.152
- Even me? Oh, thanks
for the affirmation, buddy.

38:48.154 --> 38:51.021
Sleep tight.

38:57.929 --> 39:01.063
(soft music playing)

39:01.065 --> 39:03.465
- Was Sylvia mad?
- Not at all.

39:03.467 --> 39:06.067
She was glad he had
such a good time.

39:06.069 --> 39:08.235
- Wow. She's great for him.

39:08.237 --> 39:11.004
- I'm so happy he found her.

39:11.006 --> 39:13.806
- Especially after
the others, huh?

39:13.808 --> 39:16.241
- Remember Michelle?

39:16.243 --> 39:18.409
- Michelle from hell.

39:18.411 --> 39:20.310
- And Stephanie?

39:20.312 --> 39:22.478
- Is she the one who did
DNA tests on the hairs

39:22.480 --> 39:24.980
she found on his jacket?
Yeah, she was a real prize.

39:24.982 --> 39:26.948
- Well, now he's got Sylvia.
Just goes to show:

39:26.950 --> 39:29.250
you only have
to choose well once.

39:36.658 --> 39:38.791
Hey.

39:38.793 --> 39:42.161
What's wrong?

39:42.163 --> 39:44.663
- Kelly filed for
divorce yesterday.

39:44.665 --> 39:48.333
- Oh, she actually did it?

39:48.335 --> 39:51.936
- And she wants full
custody of Zack.

39:51.938 --> 39:54.204
- What?
- I can't believe

39:54.206 --> 39:57.907
she's that angry with me.

40:00.444 --> 40:02.677
- It's because of us.

40:05.782 --> 40:08.616
- What are you talking about?

40:08.618 --> 40:10.951
Nothing's happened.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.852
- It has.

40:12.854 --> 40:15.621
It's been happening
for a long time.

40:18.959 --> 40:22.794
Are you going to stand there and pretend
you don't know what I'm talking about?

40:31.204 --> 40:33.070

40:50.252 --> 40:52.885
- Yeah. Hey -- thank you

40:52.887 --> 40:56.655
for coming with us.
This'll make him very happy.

40:56.657 --> 40:59.090
- I wouldn't have it
any other way.

41:02.595 --> 41:04.961
- I'm sorry.

41:07.832 --> 41:11.233
I'm truly so sorry
for hurting you.

41:11.235 --> 41:14.102
- I can see that.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.170

to believe this,

41:16.172 --> 41:18.838

42:07.112 --> 42:10.446
- Got you 20 hungry wolves.
- Good.

42:10.448 --> 42:12.448
Because your friend,
the pawnbroker,

42:12.450 --> 42:16.384
is about to obtain a valuable
book on behalf of the Ancients:

42:16.386 --> 42:18.652
the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>

42:20.555 --> 42:22.488
But Mr. Setrakian...

42:22.490 --> 42:25.090
I do not expect him

42:25.092 --> 42:26.891
to honour our agreement.

42:26.893 --> 42:30.594
- Why is that?
- Because I wouldn't if I were him.

42:30.596 --> 42:33.096
Your job is to

42:33.098 --> 42:36.965
convince him to
give up the book.

42:38.802 --> 42:42.170
- I don't know, man. The old
bird is pretty tough.

42:42.172 --> 42:45.773
What if he doesn't
get convinced?

42:45.775 --> 42:48.909
- Kill him and take it.
