00:03.151 --> 00:04.890
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:04.915 --> 00:06.661
No, no, no, no, no.

00:07.344 --> 00:09.959
No, you can't leave me.
Not again.

00:11.891 --> 00:13.637
If we can send the boy
into the future,

00:13.662 --> 00:14.677
when they study him,

00:14.702 --> 00:16.833
they will realize
all that he is,

00:16.858 --> 00:18.233
and they will never go
down that path.

00:18.258 --> 00:19.951
And the Observers
will never exist.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.456
They will never invade.

00:22.085 --> 00:24.253
Michael is how were going
to see Etta again.

00:24.278 --> 00:25.732
We've still got
a long way to go.

00:26.557 --> 00:28.166
These things
we've collected,

00:28.591 --> 00:31.745
How they can be used for the
plan to defeat the Observers?

00:31.770 --> 00:34.347
They are part of a device
that we must build.

00:36.598 --> 00:38.364
There's something
I need you to do.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.722 --> 00:52.457
This is the trigger I need.

00:52.491 --> 00:54.926
It's an initiating reactor.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.888
It's lost its charge.

00:57.739 --> 00:59.879
Without this piece,

00:59.913 --> 01:03.149
I cannot reset time.

01:03.183 --> 01:08.787
If your plan is successful,
we will cease to exist.

01:08.822 --> 01:14.359
If our plan doesn't succeed,
they will cease to exist.

01:17.829 --> 01:20.030
After all this time

01:20.064 --> 01:22.832
the feelings you had
for these people...

01:22.867 --> 01:26.235
the feelings we all had,

01:26.270 --> 01:30.706
they have not grown in you?

01:30.740 --> 01:34.354
When we first came,

01:34.389 --> 01:38.356
when we started to experience
emotive development

01:38.390 --> 01:41.244
by being in this era,

01:41.279 --> 01:45.909
we agreed, the 12 of us,
to speak nothing of it.

01:45.943 --> 01:49.983
<i>You lost control,</i>
<i>as did August.</i>

01:54.840 --> 01:57.020
When we first came here

01:57.055 --> 02:01.118
we did not know the true nature
of our expedition.

02:01.152 --> 02:05.423
We were not told.

02:06.357 --> 02:10.490
The people of this era,

02:10.525 --> 02:14.044
this is their destiny.

02:25.931 --> 02:28.996
Destiny can be changed.

02:29.030 --> 02:33.064
But you have to have the will
to change it...

02:33.099 --> 02:37.886
even if it requires sacrifice.

02:39.613 --> 02:43.023
<i>I took a risk</i>
<i>even coming to see you</i>

02:43.024 --> 02:44.661
<i>because I believe</i>

02:44.695 --> 02:48.706
that the people of this era
are worth saving.

02:51.701 --> 02:52.737
It needs to be

02:52.771 --> 02:54.594
at a 22 degree angle.

02:54.628 --> 02:56.375
22 degrees.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.389
Can you hear me?

02:57.423 --> 02:58.837
Blasted thing.

02:58.871 --> 03:00.533
What I wouldn't give
for a good, old-fashioned

03:00.567 --> 03:02.181
tumor-inducing cell phone.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.129
I can hear you.

03:03.163 --> 03:04.491
22 degrees.

03:04.526 --> 03:06.156
Yeah, copy that.

03:06.190 --> 03:07.172
And make sure
it's on an even plane.

03:07.206 --> 03:10.153
Absolutely crucial.

03:10.187 --> 03:12.003
Okay. Stop.

03:12.038 --> 03:13.102
We're there.

03:13.136 --> 03:14.419
What's the energy meter reading?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.636
<i>You will see a red light on.</i>
Hello?

03:17.670 --> 03:19.203
It's me. Where are you?

03:19.237 --> 03:20.286
<i>We have the boy.</i>

03:20.321 --> 03:21.371
<i>We're on our way.</i>

03:21.405 --> 03:22.722
Once that news starts breaking

03:22.756 --> 03:23.756
I want to be out of here.

03:23.774 --> 03:25.108
I'm gonna get a few things

03:25.142 --> 03:26.359
we'll need
and come directly to you.

03:26.393 --> 03:30.598
<i>Good enough. We'll speak soon.</i>

04:26.408 --> 04:27.919
<i>It's me.</i>

04:27.953 --> 04:30.887
<i>Where are you at now?</i>

04:32.412 --> 04:33.823
<i>We have the boy.</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:36.203
<i>We're on our way.</i>

04:37.550 --> 04:39.730
<i>We have the boy.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

04:39.764 --> 04:42.634
Once the news starts breaking,
<i>I want to be out of here.</i>

04:42.668 --> 04:44.548
<i>I'm gonna get</i>
<i>a few things we'll need</i>

04:44.582 --> 04:46.295
<i>and come directly to you.</i>

04:50.492 --> 04:51.549
<i>Here you are, sir.</i>

04:51.583 --> 04:52.573
The checkpoints.

04:52.607 --> 04:53.897
Thank you, Carol.

04:53.932 --> 04:56.203
I, uh, I'll be gone

04:56.237 --> 04:58.518
for the rest
of the afternoon.

05:03.275 --> 05:05.538
Agent Broyles.

05:05.572 --> 05:09.107
I would like a word with you.

05:41.260 --> 05:45.162
You are aware we had a level one
security breach today,

05:45.164 --> 05:48.033
resulting in the abduction
of a high-value detainee

05:48.067 --> 05:50.268
from our facility.

05:50.302 --> 05:53.705
No. No, I didn't
know that.

05:53.740 --> 05:57.342
The fugitives
knew precisely where

05:57.377 --> 05:59.278
we were holding
the prisoner.

05:59.312 --> 06:03.682
You think that information came
from someone in my division?

06:03.717 --> 06:08.788
We are exploring
all possibilities.

06:08.822 --> 06:12.492
I have heard whispers

06:12.526 --> 06:16.096
<i>that the resistance operative</i>
<i>known as "the Dove"</i>

06:16.130 --> 06:20.300
<i>may be among us.</i>

06:25.039 --> 06:28.509
Well, if that were true,
whoever it is

06:28.544 --> 06:33.748
should have been
read and exposed long ago.

06:52.669 --> 06:57.607
I do not wish to keep you any
longer from your duties.

06:58.547 --> 07:02.718
<i>Remain vigilant, Phillip.</i>

07:21.203 --> 07:24.974
<i>Where have you been?</i>

07:28.012 --> 07:30.881
<i>Why would he step off</i>
<i>the monorail?</i>

07:30.915 --> 07:33.918
<i>I mean, why would he do that?</i>

07:33.952 --> 07:35.119
He knows too much.

07:35.153 --> 07:36.754
He must have known

07:36.788 --> 07:39.156
that they wanted to harm him.

07:39.190 --> 07:43.394
Apparently...
there was a reason.

07:45.430 --> 07:48.565
<i>There always is.</i>

07:50.902 --> 07:53.670
<i>I've spoken to Anil</i>
<i>and his men.</i>

07:53.705 --> 07:56.473
The magnet has been positioned
on the truck as you requested.

07:56.652 --> 07:59.388
We're missing an important part.

07:59.422 --> 08:00.909
<i>The initiating reactor's core</i>

08:00.910 --> 08:03.149
<i>decayed substantially</i>
<i>over the past 20 years.</i>

08:03.746 --> 08:07.182
I enlisted help to secure
another one from my time.

08:07.217 --> 08:08.283
An Observer?

08:08.318 --> 08:10.551
One I trust.

08:10.586 --> 08:13.521
But one of you
will need to retrieve it.

08:13.555 --> 08:16.390
So what is
the initiating reactor?

08:16.424 --> 08:18.659
<i>It provides a surge of energy</i>

08:18.693 --> 08:20.294
<i>to start up the device.</i>

08:20.328 --> 08:22.195
The purpose of this machine

08:22.230 --> 08:23.897
is to generate a singularity.

08:23.931 --> 08:26.533
Essentially, a small wormhole.

08:26.567 --> 08:28.167
<i>And once it's open,</i>

08:28.202 --> 08:30.369
then we'll be able
to deploy the cylinders.

08:30.404 --> 08:32.905
They serve
to stabilize each end.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.741
And one will remain here in our
present as an anchor.

08:35.775 --> 08:39.946
The other one will be sent to
a specific point in the future--

08:39.980 --> 08:41.114
2167.

08:41.148 --> 08:43.917
How do we get them to 2167?

08:43.951 --> 08:45.385
That's what the magnet is for.

08:45.419 --> 08:47.421
<i>It's used</i>
<i>as a launch platform.</i>

08:47.455 --> 08:50.558
It will hold the cylinder at
the precise axis it needs to be

08:50.592 --> 08:51.759
to enter the wormhole,

08:51.793 --> 08:53.227
<i>ensuring that the cylinder</i>

08:53.261 --> 08:54.895
<i>reaches its destination.</i>

08:54.930 --> 08:56.730
And the scrolls are to help us

08:56.765 --> 08:59.066
set those cylinders precisely.

08:59.101 --> 09:01.135
We'll need two generators
to power the magnet.

09:01.169 --> 09:02.803
All ready with Anil.

09:02.837 --> 09:04.438
If you're gonna run the magnet
off of two generators,

09:04.472 --> 09:05.873
they're gonna have to be
in perfect phase.

09:05.907 --> 09:07.141
We'll need a synchroscope
as well.

09:07.175 --> 09:08.843
I know that and I would have
thought of that.

09:08.877 --> 09:11.245
It would be one of them,
in there,

09:11.279 --> 09:13.047
probably near the fish tank.

09:13.081 --> 09:15.749
And Michael?

09:15.784 --> 09:20.487
He will traverse the wormhole
to 2167.

09:20.522 --> 09:22.890
He'll meet the scientist
in Oslo, Norway.

09:22.924 --> 09:27.261
And that meeting will change
the course of human evolution.

09:27.295 --> 09:29.464
How will he know
who the scientist is?

09:35.638 --> 09:38.773
There will be
someone there to guide him.

09:41.877 --> 09:43.545
It's Broyles.

09:43.579 --> 09:45.380
<i>You good?</i>

09:45.414 --> 09:47.815
I'm leaving for Boston.
I'm coming to you.

09:47.849 --> 09:49.550
<i>This is Agent Pat Wilkins.</i>

09:49.584 --> 09:51.285
<i>I have him on</i>
<i>the Spring Street Exit, number 49.</i>

09:51.319 --> 09:52.987
Northbound, lane two.

09:53.021 --> 09:54.789
<i>Copy that, traffic control.</i>

09:54.823 --> 09:56.724
<i>Bravo unit is on standby</i>
<i>to continue surveillance.</i>

09:56.758 --> 09:58.425
<i>Bravo unit has visual.</i>

09:58.460 --> 10:00.194
<i>He's 200 meters ahead</i>
<i>in the right lane.</i>

10:00.228 --> 10:01.795
<i>Copy that.</i>

10:01.830 --> 10:03.230
Call us when you're close.

10:03.265 --> 10:04.331
Peter's gonna meet you
at the entrance

10:04.366 --> 10:06.266
<i>of the Steam tunnel.</i>

10:07.969 --> 10:10.204
<i>Broyles, are you there?</i>

10:10.238 --> 10:12.506
Can you hear me?

10:12.540 --> 10:14.308
<i>Hello?</i>

10:14.342 --> 10:16.108
They're following me.

10:16.142 --> 10:18.677
<i>Windmark is letting me</i>
<i>lead them to you.</i>

10:18.712 --> 10:21.914
<i>I'll lead them around</i>
<i>as long as I can.</i>

10:21.948 --> 10:24.616
But it's only a matter of time
before they realize

10:24.650 --> 10:26.718
I'm not leading them to you.

10:26.753 --> 10:30.188
If I'm caught, they'll read me.

10:30.223 --> 10:31.924
<i>I can protect my thoughts,</i>

10:31.958 --> 10:33.438
<i>but there's only so long</i>
<i>that'll last.</i>

10:33.459 --> 10:34.860
Okay, Windmark is not
going to read you

10:34.894 --> 10:36.494
because we're going
to come and get you.

10:36.529 --> 10:38.463
The most important thing
is the plan.

10:38.497 --> 10:40.898
Listen to me, Phillip, you need
to tell me where you are.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.534
Olivia...

10:46.905 --> 10:48.472
Just get it done.

10:48.506 --> 10:50.640
<i>Just tell me wh--</i>

10:59.149 --> 11:01.284
You heard him.

11:01.318 --> 11:03.319
If he's captured,
it's only a matter of time

11:03.353 --> 11:04.754
before they know we're here.

11:04.788 --> 11:08.090
<i>Peter, start excavating</i>
<i>that synchroscope.</i>

11:08.124 --> 11:09.892
We need to go
get the new initiator.

11:09.926 --> 11:13.095
And we need to gather everything
that is required and leave.

11:13.129 --> 11:15.998
It's our only chance.

11:25.058 --> 11:27.082
<i>Peter, how are you doing</i>
<i>with they synchroscope?</i>

11:27.084 --> 11:29.119
<i>No synchroscope yet.</i>

11:29.153 --> 11:31.188
But I found
some sort of syringe.

11:31.222 --> 11:34.724
<i>Any idea what that was for</i>
<i>or why you had it?</i>

11:34.758 --> 11:37.026
I have no idea.

11:41.765 --> 11:44.166
This tape is addressed to me.

11:48.038 --> 11:51.407
It's your handwriting.

11:57.348 --> 12:01.083
Peter, I sent you a letter.

12:01.118 --> 12:03.119
<i>It contains something of mine.</i>

12:03.153 --> 12:04.554
What letter, Walter?

12:04.588 --> 12:06.155
<i>I imagine you called me to ask</i>

12:06.190 --> 12:08.758
<i>why would you send</i>
<i>such a strange letter?</i>

12:08.792 --> 12:11.760
And when you tried to call,
I didn't answer.

12:11.795 --> 12:14.096
<i>So you came to find me</i>
<i>at the lab.</i>

12:14.130 --> 12:17.366
But I was not to be found.

12:17.401 --> 12:18.968
I was here one moment

12:19.002 --> 12:24.840
<i>and vanished from the face</i>
<i>of the earth the next.</i>

12:24.875 --> 12:29.278
I want you to know I'm fine.

12:29.313 --> 12:33.716
<i>And living many,</i>
<i>many years from now.</i>

12:33.750 --> 12:35.751
What is this, Walter?

12:35.786 --> 12:39.822
You will never see me again.

12:39.856 --> 12:43.792
<i>You will never see me again</i>
<i>because it had to be this way</i>

12:43.826 --> 12:47.362
to ensure the future
of our humanity.

12:47.397 --> 12:51.133
<i>Your future.</i>

12:51.167 --> 12:53.668
The future of Olivia.

12:53.703 --> 12:58.506
And the future of Etta.

12:58.541 --> 13:00.909
<i>I don't want you to be sad.</i>

13:00.943 --> 13:05.346
The time we had
together we stole.

13:05.381 --> 13:08.149
<i>I cheated fate</i>
<i>to be with you.</i>

13:08.184 --> 13:12.421
<i>And we shouldn't have had that</i>
<i>time together, but we did.</i>

13:14.290 --> 13:17.727
And I wouldn't change it
for the world.

13:23.199 --> 13:26.969
I don't want to say good-bye.

13:30.173 --> 13:34.743
But I will say...

13:34.778 --> 13:39.615
I love you, son.

13:39.650 --> 13:42.685
<i>I wasn't truthful with you.</i>

13:42.719 --> 13:45.154
I do know what that is.

13:45.189 --> 13:50.227
<i>It's an inoculation</i>
<i>for time travel.</i>

13:50.261 --> 13:54.697
I'm taking the child Observer
into the future, Peter.

13:54.732 --> 13:59.469
<i>I was already inoculated</i>
<i>in 2015.</i>

13:59.503 --> 14:02.838
I left this one in case
something happened to me

14:02.873 --> 14:05.207
and someone else
had to bring the boy across

14:05.242 --> 14:09.646
to complete the plan.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.214
Does it have to be
this way?

14:11.249 --> 14:13.850
Yes!

14:13.884 --> 14:17.020
Why?

14:24.263 --> 14:26.130
Because, Peter,

14:26.165 --> 14:30.335
the boy and I,
we will become a paradox.

14:30.369 --> 14:35.206
Nature abhors a paradox.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.977
It has to heal itself.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.982
It does so by deleting
me and the boy

14:43.016 --> 14:46.618
at the moment of the invasion.

14:46.653 --> 14:52.557
The boy and I will disappear
after 2015.

14:52.592 --> 14:57.862
So in order to maintain a future
without the Observers...

14:57.897 --> 14:59.864
you and Michael have to live out

14:59.898 --> 15:02.767
the rest of your lives
in the future.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.977
I know in my soul

15:13.011 --> 15:18.282
this is what
I am supposed to do.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.085
I want you to give Olivia

15:21.120 --> 15:24.689
your daughter back.

15:24.723 --> 15:30.028
I want to give you
your life back.

15:34.268 --> 15:38.404
As a father, how could I not
do that for you?

15:40.841 --> 15:42.375
What I said on the tape

15:42.409 --> 15:46.578
about stealing time with you,
I meant it.

15:46.613 --> 15:51.917
I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

15:58.459 --> 16:03.129
You are
my favorite thing, Peter.

16:03.164 --> 16:07.267
My very favorite thing.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.661
<i>Where's the logbook?</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:08.962
<i>You left it in the car.</i>

17:08.996 --> 17:10.128
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

17:10.164 --> 17:11.598
<i>It's in the room.</i>

17:11.632 --> 17:14.800
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

17:24.412 --> 17:27.781
What happened to the part?

17:27.816 --> 17:30.418
This was taken from
one of the original 12

17:30.452 --> 17:33.654
scientific expedition team.

17:33.688 --> 17:36.757
Your order to monitor
the remaining members was wise.

17:36.791 --> 17:41.195
<i>When December traveled to the</i>
<i>future and procured this unit</i>

17:41.229 --> 17:43.230
I was notified.

17:43.264 --> 17:45.499
What is this?

17:45.533 --> 17:47.868
September is assembling
a device

17:47.902 --> 17:49.336
with the fugitives.

17:49.370 --> 17:52.172
It is a trigger containing
an atomic charge

17:52.206 --> 17:55.242
that is going to allow them
to create a wormhole.

17:55.277 --> 17:59.413
They intend to reset time.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.252
He's in the number six
stairwell.

18:32.286 --> 18:33.720
B-unit, cover
the 61st Street exit.

18:33.754 --> 18:35.354
Subject is moving on foot.

18:35.389 --> 18:37.923
<i>Repeat, he's in</i>
<i>the number six stairwell.</i>

18:37.957 --> 18:42.060
He knows that we know.

18:53.706 --> 18:55.340
You're saying
we can't complete the plan

18:55.374 --> 18:57.475
because we're missing
one single piece?

18:57.509 --> 18:58.909
Without
the initiating reactor

18:58.944 --> 19:00.277
<i>there's no way we can</i>
<i>open the wormhole.</i>

19:00.312 --> 19:02.012
There's simply not
enough energy.

19:02.047 --> 19:03.481
I thought the rocks
provided the energy.

19:03.515 --> 19:05.483
To sustain the reaction,
not to trigger it.

19:05.517 --> 19:08.752
Like a car with a full tank
and no sparkplug.

19:08.787 --> 19:10.053
We're stuck.

19:10.088 --> 19:12.155
There must be some place

19:12.190 --> 19:14.091
<i>we can find</i>
<i>another ignition source.</i>

19:14.125 --> 19:15.225
Or maybe we can make one
of our own.

19:15.259 --> 19:16.560
It's impossible.

19:16.594 --> 19:18.062
<i>Nothing strong enough</i>
<i>is available</i>

19:18.096 --> 19:19.163
<i>in this time period.</i>

19:19.198 --> 19:21.165
Michael, I need your help.

19:23.436 --> 19:26.205
When I crossed over
to rescue you,

19:26.239 --> 19:29.809
you looked at me
like you expected me.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.210
You smiled...

19:31.245 --> 19:34.313
like you knew
I'd come for you.

19:34.348 --> 19:39.585
Can you tell me
what I should do next?

20:05.613 --> 20:10.184
What about a shipping lane?

20:10.218 --> 20:12.619
Of course.

20:12.654 --> 20:16.022
If we could gain control
of the shipping lane,

20:16.056 --> 20:18.558
<i>we can use that</i>
<i>as our wormhole</i>

20:18.592 --> 20:20.994
<i>and everything else</i>
<i>would work as planned.</i>

20:21.028 --> 20:23.863
You are a genius!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.802
This is the shipping
manifest I decoded.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.137
It's his schedule.

20:30.171 --> 20:31.572
It'll give us the location
and the time

20:31.606 --> 20:32.773
of the next shipment.

20:32.807 --> 20:34.240
So when is it opening?

20:34.275 --> 20:35.975
Tomorrow morning
at 6:08 a.m.

20:36.010 --> 20:38.745
<i>40.7787 North.</i>

20:38.779 --> 20:41.414
73.9776 West.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.218
It's New York.

20:45.252 --> 20:47.319
Okay, Astrid, see what you can
find out about the checkpoints.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.489
First we need
an end dock stabilizer.

20:49.523 --> 20:51.791
What is
an end dock stabilizer?

20:51.826 --> 20:53.126
It looks like a cube.

20:53.161 --> 20:54.594
<i>And you activate it</i>
<i>at the location</i>

20:54.628 --> 20:55.929
<i>where the wormhole opens.</i>

20:55.963 --> 20:57.397
I know exactly what you mean.

20:57.431 --> 20:59.833
If we recalibrate it,
we can reverse the polarity

20:59.867 --> 21:01.735
and change the directional flow
of the shipping lane

21:01.769 --> 21:03.303
so that it will send
rather than receive.

21:03.338 --> 21:05.906
Anil?

21:05.940 --> 21:07.341
Broyles.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.509
He's been captured.

21:08.543 --> 21:10.044
<i>I put out feelers.</i>

21:10.078 --> 21:11.612
<i>I'll keep you informed.</i>

21:11.646 --> 21:15.749
What does this mean
for the plan?

21:15.784 --> 21:18.185
It's happening
tomorrow morning.

21:18.219 --> 21:20.888
There's one other thing
we need first.

21:37.539 --> 21:39.073
<i>Peter.</i>

21:39.107 --> 21:41.408
Hold on to these tight.

21:41.443 --> 21:44.044
Anti-gravity osmium bullets.

21:44.078 --> 21:45.612
<i>Shoot Observers with these</i>

21:45.647 --> 21:48.182
and watch them
float away like balloons.

21:48.216 --> 21:49.516
If we shoot 'em,
they're dead.

21:49.551 --> 21:52.852
Why do we want 'em
to float away?

21:52.887 --> 21:54.587
Because it's cool.

21:54.622 --> 21:57.724
That makes sense, Walter.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.930
Okay.

22:03.965 --> 22:06.132
I'll start
loading the car.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.608
You gonna be okay?

22:18.679 --> 22:20.880
<i>Walter?</i>

22:20.915 --> 22:23.950
There's something
I wanna show you.

22:30.158 --> 22:34.061
Peter...

22:34.095 --> 22:36.297
I want to talk to you.

22:48.312 --> 22:51.348
Gene.

22:51.382 --> 22:52.816
<i>I was gonna let her out.</i>

22:52.850 --> 22:56.486
But I was afraid
that they would hear her moo.

22:56.521 --> 22:58.055
Yes.

22:58.089 --> 23:01.158
She does moo quite loudly.

23:01.192 --> 23:02.860
Especially after a meal.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.170
I at least wanted you
to see her.

23:17.009 --> 23:20.946
You always know
how to soothe me.

23:20.980 --> 23:25.083
You always have.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.590
Walter, this is
not the end.

23:32.624 --> 23:35.593
We're gonna win this.

23:35.628 --> 23:38.529
And when we do,
we'll be...

23:38.564 --> 23:41.099
drinking strawberry milkshakes
in the lab

23:41.133 --> 23:44.101
and not even gonna remember
that this happened.

23:44.136 --> 23:45.837
That sounds lovely.

23:52.444 --> 23:54.746
It's a beautiful name.

23:57.483 --> 24:00.084
What is?

24:00.118 --> 24:02.620
Astrid.

24:29.814 --> 24:32.049
<i>Before we arrived here</i>

24:32.083 --> 24:36.220
<i>we sent a team of 12.</i>

24:36.254 --> 24:40.324
Their mission
was to observe and report.

24:43.094 --> 24:47.765
However, a strange
phenomenon occurred.

24:47.799 --> 24:49.666
To some degree
or other,

24:49.701 --> 24:54.105
they succumbed
to irrational emotions.

24:54.139 --> 24:58.943
Your kind infected them.

24:58.977 --> 25:02.113
But not you.

25:02.147 --> 25:05.850
You seem to be
impervious to everything.

25:08.187 --> 25:11.789
I will never
speak of it again.

25:11.823 --> 25:17.128
But I will admit this
to you, Phillip.

25:17.162 --> 25:22.000
I, too, feel something.

25:22.034 --> 25:24.669
I believe
you call it...

25:27.473 --> 25:29.852
Hate.

25:32.244 --> 25:36.381
The feeling is mutual.

25:52.265 --> 25:54.166
What?

25:55.936 --> 25:57.904
Remember when I told you
that we had a long way to go

25:57.938 --> 26:02.007
before seeing her again?

26:02.042 --> 26:05.311
It's not
that long anymore.

26:13.353 --> 26:16.722
We're gonna see her.

26:16.756 --> 26:18.924
We're gonna
have her back.

26:21.795 --> 26:25.031
Nothing else matters.

26:41.314 --> 26:44.684
He's here.

26:44.718 --> 26:47.019
Hey.
Hi.

26:47.053 --> 26:49.721
This is an air intake
supply line.

26:49.756 --> 26:52.057
It leads to half the building.

26:52.091 --> 26:54.793
That's enough, believe me.
Good luck.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.497
We need to get going.

27:30.531 --> 27:33.167
We have to meet them.

27:46.015 --> 27:49.518
I gave myself
the last inoculation.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.054
I'm going with him, Walter.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.923
I'm taking him into the future.

27:54.957 --> 27:57.575
I've already told Peter
about my decision.

27:59.895 --> 28:03.931
I know you once believed
that this was your destiny,

28:03.965 --> 28:05.733
a price you had to pay.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.201
I need this.

28:08.236 --> 28:10.737
I have prepared myself
for this.

28:10.771 --> 28:11.838
I've been thinking
about this

28:11.872 --> 28:14.407
since I first
saw the boy again.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.176
Walter, 20 years ago

28:17.211 --> 28:19.612
when I agreed to let you
be the one to take him,

28:19.647 --> 28:23.182
I didn't have
the feelings I have now.

28:24.651 --> 28:29.122
Later, when I began to realize
the height of his intellect

28:29.156 --> 28:32.725
and what you call
the depths of his emotion,

28:32.760 --> 28:38.131
still, I couldn't
understand what it was

28:38.165 --> 28:40.467
that I meant to him.

28:40.501 --> 28:44.705
And I was unable
to reciprocate.

28:47.008 --> 28:51.145
When I saw you...

28:51.180 --> 28:54.582
When I saw Peter

28:54.617 --> 28:57.552
and saw what he meant
to you...

29:00.356 --> 29:04.226
then I understood
what my feelings were.

29:04.260 --> 29:08.063
And why
they were important.

29:08.098 --> 29:13.835
I can't communicate with him
in the traditional ways.

29:13.870 --> 29:18.173
When I take his hand

29:18.207 --> 29:22.844
and I lead him...

29:22.878 --> 29:26.180
He'll know
that I love him.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.358
That's being a father.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.505
It's not
about fate, Walter.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.640
Yours or mine.

29:56.012 --> 30:00.182
It's about
changing fate.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.985
It's about hope.

30:05.488 --> 30:08.357
And protecting
our children.

30:26.109 --> 30:30.245
Think about them, Phillip.

30:30.280 --> 30:33.049
Think about
where they are.

30:33.083 --> 30:38.521
They will understand
you had no choice.

30:38.556 --> 30:42.859
It is acceptable.

30:42.893 --> 30:45.862
I am your ally.

30:45.897 --> 30:47.597
At the old Harvard University.

30:47.632 --> 30:49.766
Harvard University.

30:49.801 --> 30:53.537
They're in the lab.
They're in the lab.

31:07.686 --> 31:10.488
<i>Evacuate!</i>
<i>Clear the building!</i>

31:10.523 --> 31:12.991
<i>This room is clear.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

31:13.025 --> 31:15.593
<i>Keep moving down the hall.</i>
<i>All clear on this end.</i>

31:15.627 --> 31:18.362
<i>Go down to the left!</i>

31:18.397 --> 31:21.199
<i>Evacuate the building!</i>

31:22.568 --> 31:25.069
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

31:25.104 --> 31:28.906
<i>Keep going!</i>

31:35.080 --> 31:37.749
<i>It is entering</i>
<i>this wing.</i>

31:37.783 --> 31:39.784
Evacuate.

31:42.955 --> 31:45.590
<i>It just came after us!</i>

31:45.624 --> 31:49.428
<i>Just keep moving!</i>
<i>Go!</i>

33:13.081 --> 33:14.448
I found one.

33:14.482 --> 33:15.982
Good. Because
I found something too.

33:20.855 --> 33:22.389
We're gonna get you
out of here.

33:22.423 --> 33:24.090
You don't know
how lucky you are

33:24.125 --> 33:26.226
this room has no ventilation.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.161
Trust me.

34:00.925 --> 34:02.759
They'll be setting up
the corridor soon.

34:02.794 --> 34:03.994
We don't have much time.

34:04.029 --> 34:05.362
<i>Where are Peter and Olivia?</i>

34:07.499 --> 34:10.900
Olivia, where are you?

34:10.935 --> 34:13.370
They've got the cube...

34:13.405 --> 34:15.806
and Agent Broyles.

34:58.517 --> 35:00.118
Anil, we're in position.

35:00.152 --> 35:01.619
We have to hurry!

35:02.788 --> 35:05.624
Team two, engage.

35:08.528 --> 35:11.964
<i>Stand by.</i>

35:11.998 --> 35:13.932
<i>We got a vehicle on approach!</i>

35:18.572 --> 35:21.440
<i>Incoming!</i>
<i>Coming through!</i>

35:25.245 --> 35:26.912
<i>That's an unauthorized</i>
<i>vehicle!</i>

35:26.947 --> 35:28.514
<i>Take it out!</i>
<i>Open fire!</i>

35:28.548 --> 35:32.852
<i>We got a breach!</i>

35:43.497 --> 35:46.499
<i>Negative, negative!</i>

35:46.533 --> 35:47.934
<i>Suppressive fire!</i>

35:47.968 --> 35:50.937
<i>All teams converge</i>
<i>on main platform.</i>

35:50.971 --> 35:52.538
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

35:52.573 --> 35:55.475
<i>Regroup, regroup!</i>

35:55.509 --> 35:59.645
<i>Tighten your lines!</i>

35:59.680 --> 36:01.481
<i>We got a man down.</i>

36:01.515 --> 36:04.484
<i>Stay with them!</i>

36:06.787 --> 36:09.322
Michael, stay down.

36:15.362 --> 36:17.896
<i>Two down, and pull 'em in!</i>

36:17.931 --> 36:20.766
<i>Return fire!</i>

36:20.800 --> 36:23.535
<i>Flank 'em on the left.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

36:23.570 --> 36:27.239
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

36:27.273 --> 36:28.807
Peter! Peter, look!

36:28.841 --> 36:29.808
<i>What did I say?</i>

36:29.842 --> 36:33.011
That is cool.

36:44.891 --> 36:46.792
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

36:47.828 --> 36:50.529
<i>Regroup, regroup!</i>

36:53.033 --> 36:55.868
<i>2:00, 2:00!</i>
<i>Take 'em out!</i>

37:00.807 --> 37:02.608
Now, Walter!

37:14.921 --> 37:16.956
Get the boy.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.584
Let's go.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.387
 ]

40:41.404 --> 40:43.672
I love you, Dad.

41:21.478 --> 41:25.114
I think that I would
be happy to stay here

41:25.148 --> 41:26.282
for the rest of my life.

41:32.423 --> 41:35.257
We should probably
get her home soon.

41:35.291 --> 41:39.762
Get her into a bath,
which is never easy.

41:39.796 --> 41:41.530
I nominate you
for that one.

41:41.564 --> 41:43.131
Etta!

41:43.166 --> 41:46.401
<i>It's time to go.</i>

41:46.436 --> 41:51.740
Come on, kiddo.
It's time to go home.
