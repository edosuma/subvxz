WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:02.470
Previously on Scorpion...
Every time you think I should

00:02.503 --> 00:03.537
give you a pat on the back,
just hit that button

00:03.571 --> 00:05.406
and know that even though
I don't say it enough,

00:05.439 --> 00:07.775
I really mean it.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.777
HAPPY'S VOICE:
Attaboy.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.645
I'll submit to the board
after school.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.315
Speaking of which,
I've never had a tardy before,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.384
and I'm not starting now.
And you're not starting now.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.087
Hey, Patty.
Yup.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.324
Really don't like
this development.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.793
PAIGE: This is Ian Gleason,
British Intelligence.

00:25.826 --> 00:26.960
Since when do we
work for MI6?

00:26.994 --> 00:30.464
Agent Gallo, you're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.632
I want a lawyer.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.167
I want to be your attorney.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.168
You want to what?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.169
SYLVESTER:
I care about Cabe,

00:35.203 --> 00:36.570
and I will scour
every law book

00:36.604 --> 00:39.573
and memorize every archaic
regulation to protect him.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.674
I can do this.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.244
I'm just gonna
listen about you and...

00:43.277 --> 00:45.779
your mindset, the upcoming
trial, how you feel.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.648
Whatever you want to say.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.818
(hammering)

00:54.722 --> 00:58.692
Well, I guess if I had to reduce
it to simplest forms, I'm...

00:58.726 --> 01:02.130
I'm concerned.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.332
I'm concerned
about going to prison.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.734
TOBY:
Okay, but the, um...

01:06.767 --> 01:11.639
last few times we've spoken,
you've told me you were, uh...

01:11.672 --> 01:14.175
"worried," uh,

01:14.208 --> 01:17.378
"apprehensive"
and "uneasy."

01:17.411 --> 01:20.381
And now you've added
a fourth synonym to the mix,

01:20.414 --> 01:23.451
so, you're doing great
if this were an SAT prep class.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.119
You don't give yourself
enough credit, Doc.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.387
Listen to what you just told me.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.788
I said it four different ways.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.291
I'm nervous about going to
the Big House. Nervous.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.859
Now you've said it five ways.

01:31.892 --> 01:32.960
The point is,

01:32.993 --> 01:35.429
I've had the opportunity
to bring up anything else

01:35.463 --> 01:36.897
that's bothering me--
anything else--

01:36.930 --> 01:39.133
and I keep coming back
to the same thing.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.302
That's because
you're deflecting, Cabe.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.803
When someone refuses

01:42.836 --> 01:46.140
to even consider anything other
than the most superficial,

01:46.174 --> 01:48.642
that means there's many
deeper layers to the onion.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.678
You ever think
that I'm a one-layer onion?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.112
I'm tellin' you,
this is a breakthrough.

01:52.146 --> 01:55.216
Saying that you don't have any
issues is not a breakthrough.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.185
I didn't say
I didn't have any issues.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.252
I said I had one issue--

01:58.286 --> 02:00.354
an issue that anyone
who's facing lock-up would have.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.523
I'm anxious
about goin' to the joint.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.925
It's completely normal.
I'm cured!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.361
You did a great job, Doc.
(hammering)

02:07.395 --> 02:09.830
Anxious.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.501
(door closes)
Six synonyms.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.436
How was therapy, old man?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.737
I'm cured.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.172
Good to hear.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.174
It wasn't as bad
as you think.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.575
The mayor was aggressive.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.843
PATTY:
You were rambling.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.345
It was just a shush.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.181
It was shushy and pushy,
and I don't appreciate it.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.349
How's our favorite alderman?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.550
Ineffective.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.919
He explains his ideas
in agonizing detail

02:31.952 --> 02:33.654
until everyone's eyes
glaze over.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.189
It was an 8:00 a.m. meeting.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.325
Maybe they were still groggy.
Some advice?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.660
KISS:
"Keep It Simple, Sylvester."

02:39.693 --> 02:41.195
Speak to those
guys in a way

02:41.229 --> 02:42.930
they can understand,
like a human.

02:42.963 --> 02:43.931
Not like a lecturer.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.900
Speaking of lectures,
I got to get to school.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.536
ALL:
'Cause you've never had a tardy

02:48.569 --> 02:50.371
and you're not gonna start now.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.439
Damn right.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.742
(hammering)

02:54.775 --> 02:56.744
You can come out now, Romeo.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.948
Pretty weak, Ralphie-boy.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.250
You're one to talk.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.651
You're scared of her, too.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.853
Scared of who?
Donuts.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.656
Patty, Ralph's
girlfriend.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.491
(sighs)
I wish.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.326
Can't even get
her to notice me.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.662
Try not hiding next time.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.430
I can help you
with this one.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.498
Not good.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.666
Ignore her.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.000
Now, Ralph, what
a woman wants,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.902
really wants, is
for you to listen,

03:21.935 --> 03:23.937
truly hear what
is troubling her.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.973
Not half-bad advice.
And then you can quickly

03:26.006 --> 03:26.907
solve that problem for her,

03:26.940 --> 03:28.442
and move on to something
more interesting.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.677
Back to normal.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.845
PAIGE:
Walter! What did you do?

03:31.879 --> 03:32.980
CABE: Sounds like you
have the opportunity

03:33.013 --> 03:35.349
to put that theory
into practice.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.817
What is this?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.686
Well, my sweet, I, uh...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.689
I noticed a plethora
of your beauty aids collecting

03:41.722 --> 03:43.023
and multiplying in my bathroom--

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
not that you need beauty aids...
Get to it.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.394
So, I threw all
that nonsense away,

03:46.427 --> 03:47.828
and I solved your problem

03:47.861 --> 03:50.998
by creating an organic
nutrient-rich slurry

03:51.031 --> 03:53.267
that fulfills all your needs.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.002
Uh, it moisturizes,
removes makeup,

03:55.035 --> 03:56.970
conditions you hair.
You can even use it

03:57.004 --> 04:00.341
to spackle the epidural rhytides
on the sides of your mouth.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.443
What the hell's a rhytide?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.912
It is the medical term for wrinkles.
Excuse me?!

04:04.945 --> 04:06.580
I'm out of here.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.649
I have one, maybe two,
very minor laugh lines

04:08.682 --> 04:10.484
that only appear in the
brightest of sunlight,

04:10.518 --> 04:13.621
and, for your information, that
is a sign of a joy-filled life.

04:13.654 --> 04:17.791
So, I want
my stuff back.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.663
Did you see how
he solved that problem, Ralph?

04:23.997 --> 04:24.998
It stinks.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.301
I know. Mom's a handful.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.437
No, I mean it stinks in here.
(sniffing)

04:29.470 --> 04:31.805
He's right.
Is Ray back?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.375
Hey, who cut the Monterey Jack?

04:34.408 --> 04:37.044
Hey, guys, there's something's
coming out of this vent.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.380
It smells like rotten egg.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.351
What the hell is that?

04:46.754 --> 04:47.821
Hey, who are you?

04:47.855 --> 04:50.724
(sighs)
My name is Florence Tipton.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.792
I'm your new neighbor.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.994
I just set up my lab
in the adjoining warehouse.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.529
Ooh, a lab. Computer?

04:55.563 --> 04:56.997
Robotics?
The nature

04:57.030 --> 04:59.633
of my work is immaterial, but
if you must know, I'm a chemist.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.402
And I cannot function
with all this distraction.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.736
Oh, you got hit
with the egg smell, too?

05:02.770 --> 05:03.704
No, you misunderstand.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.340
I intentionally directed
a sulfur-based mist

05:06.374 --> 05:08.609
through our shared
ventilation system, because

05:08.642 --> 05:11.044
I was trying to work, and
you were being too loud.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.415
Happy was banging out a dent.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.616
Did you think about asking us

05:15.649 --> 05:19.052
to keep the noise down before
resorting to a stink-bomb?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.555
I banged on the
wall, repeatedly,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.123
but you didn't respond,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.426
most likely because you couldn't
hear over the cacophony,

05:25.459 --> 05:27.561
so, I didn't have
another option.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.398
Surely there was
some other option.

05:30.431 --> 05:34.134
Well, now that I have
your attention, I'd just...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.571
I'd really appreciate it
if you could keep it down.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.774
Have a pleasant day.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.912
Oh.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.416
The mist that I discharged--
that was a two.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.818
Don't make me send in a ten.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.889
(sighs)

05:55.923 --> 05:57.591
(door closes)

05:57.625 --> 05:59.427
Well, I don't like her.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.861
(phone rings)

06:00.894 --> 06:02.463
Hello?

06:02.496 --> 06:03.731
Yeah, this is he.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.098
I don't like
her, either.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.402
Yeah. Comes in here
and tells us what to do.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.336
Who needs her?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.438
If I want to get bossed around,
I got Happy.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.407
Exactly. Plus, I don't stop
wrenching for anyone.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.908
She thinks that was loud,
just wait

06:14.942 --> 06:16.610
until she hears me
working on my bikes.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.711
PAIGE:
Can we stop

06:17.745 --> 06:20.848
piling on for a minute,
look at her point of view?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.850
She's new, she just
set up her lab.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.918
Clearly it's important to her,
and then she finds out

06:24.952 --> 06:26.887
her neighbors are... Charming?
Brilliant?

06:26.920 --> 06:27.888
Sexy?

06:27.921 --> 06:28.922
Different.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.125
And sometimes not as considerate
as they could be.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.326
I think we should make an effort
to be nice to her.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.164
You know what they say: you can
catch more flies with honey.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.501
You catch the most flies
with Ethyl Hexanediol.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.969
Or a Tetrofluro-4 compound.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.437
Or a rolled up newspaper.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.038
I give up.
(car horn honks)

06:45.072 --> 06:47.007
Oh. Ralph, carpool.
Just in time.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.209
These guys are
a bad influence.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.679
Team, I just got a call
from Gleason.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.213
MI6 Agent Gleason?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.014
"Cut his finger off to help us

06:54.047 --> 06:55.883
beat a dictator at the UN"
Gleason?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.050
I love that guy.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.586
Easy on the love, darlin'.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.854
WALTER: We'll be
getting a video call

07:00.888 --> 07:03.223
from his fellow agent, Gemma
Franklin, in a few minutes.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.126
His exact words-- "Scorpion is
critical to survival."

07:06.159 --> 07:07.495
For Britain?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.229
No. For the world.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.698
Agent Gleason sends his best.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.700
This is an extremely
urgent matter.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.068
Yesterday afternoon,
the U.K. lost control

07:15.102 --> 07:18.171
of our 19-K Satellite armed
with military grade lasers.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.172
Military grade?

07:19.206 --> 07:21.174
That violates a host
of international agreements.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.510
Yeah, I don't need
to be told something

07:22.543 --> 07:23.511
I already know, thank you.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.812
We launched the 19-K

07:24.845 --> 07:26.246
to protect our nation
and its allies

07:26.279 --> 07:27.314
from rogue missile attacks.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.549
It was disguised as
telecommunications hardware,

07:28.582 --> 07:31.719
but a group of anarchist hackers
somehow knew its true purpose

07:31.752 --> 07:32.786
and took control of it.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.489
MI6 was, however,
able to obtain the IP address

07:35.523 --> 07:37.525
of whomever is directing
the 19-K.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.092
Let me guess.
Heavily encrypted.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.828
Obviously.
That's why we've come to you.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.162
All we know is the hacker

07:42.195 --> 07:43.997
currently manipulates
our weaponry from somewhere

07:44.031 --> 07:46.166
within a few mile radius
of Los Angeles Airport.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.502
My plane will land there in...
five minutes,

07:48.536 --> 07:49.970
so we might still
have enough time.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.805
What do you mean "enough time"?
GEMMA: The minimal data

07:51.839 --> 07:54.141
we were able to cultivate before
being completely shut out

07:54.174 --> 07:56.176
of the 19-K shows that
the lasers are programmed

07:56.209 --> 07:58.812
to strike somewhere
in Los Angeles.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.714
And as of now, we have...

08:00.748 --> 08:02.616
58 minutes until they fire.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.917
Okay, who's up
for Vegas?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.218
Well, we should be able to

08:05.252 --> 08:07.921
decrypt the IP address,
but we'll need to do it

08:07.955 --> 08:10.558
on the move towards LAX due
to the severe time constraint.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.093
He's right. Gemma, we'll get
prepped and meet up soon.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.697
Okay, Doc,
what do you think?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.098
She pass the sniff test?

08:18.131 --> 08:19.867
I mean, there's multiple
covering markers,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.268
but she's a spy.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.571
She's trained
to hide information, so...

08:23.604 --> 08:26.607
It could be as innocuous
as her real name isn't Gemma,

08:26.640 --> 08:28.576
and that could just be
standard MI6

08:28.609 --> 08:30.310
security protocol,
so, bottom line--

08:30.343 --> 08:33.814
I'm-I'm not picking up any signs
of maliciousness or bad will.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.316
If Agent Gleason backs her,
then she must be all right.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.786
Gleason's a straight shooter,
risked his life alongside us.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.187
I trust him.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.321
WALTER:
Okay.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.523
So, if we're agreed,
let's gear up.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.130
Um, Walter,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.299
I'm not as sure about
Agent Gemma as everyone else is.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.834
Not sure about what?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.236
Don't know.
She's curt, rude even.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.705
Well, she's British.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.306
I just get a vibe from her.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.207
That's all I'm saying.
Paige,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.610
I-I don't know what to do
with a vibe.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.476
Now, I appreciate your concern,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.278
but, uh, we don't have
the time, so,

09:05.312 --> 09:08.015
we got to go, okay?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.182
(car backfires)

09:09.216 --> 09:10.317
PAIGE:
Cabe,

09:10.350 --> 09:12.352
it's a million degrees in here.
Can you turn the AC on?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.821
Doesn't work.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.288
WALTER:
Whoever encrypted this

09:15.322 --> 09:16.690
knew what they were doing.
SYLVESTER: Copy that.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.191
But I am making progress.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.326
Same here.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.293
Can you roll
the back windows down?

09:20.327 --> 09:21.662
They don't work, either.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.630
WALTER:
Sly, the hacker

09:22.663 --> 09:24.264
will probably be operating
from a location

09:24.297 --> 09:25.365
that allows him to be

09:25.398 --> 09:27.801
as close as possible
to the satellite so that when

09:27.835 --> 09:30.671
he fires the laser,
it ensures maximum connectivity.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.872
I don't get it.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.306
They got control,
they got control, right?

09:33.340 --> 09:34.908
Well, you don't
hack a satellite

09:34.942 --> 09:36.610
and then set it
on autopilot.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.111
There's constant readjusting
of the coordinates

09:38.145 --> 09:39.613
as it moves
through the thermosphere.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.781
SYLVESTER:
Hey, I'm looking at

09:40.814 --> 09:42.382
the 19-K's orbit now.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.252
It is over Nevada,

09:45.285 --> 09:47.855
heading directly
towards Western Los Angeles.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.322
WALTER: Or, more specifically,
Venice Beach.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.691
That's where we'll find our guy.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.227
CABE:
Okay.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.495
Gemma will be here any minute.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.331
Walter will lead her and me up
to the hacker's room upstairs.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.332
He'll wait outside.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.167
We'll apprehend the suspect,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.034
and when we give you
the all-clear...

10:01.068 --> 10:03.236
We'll run up and
nerd out on his computer

10:03.270 --> 10:04.905
until we regain control
of the satellite.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.273
(gasps)
Sound plan, Agent Gallo.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.241
I see why they call
you spies "spooks."

10:08.275 --> 10:10.077
You just scared
the hell out of me.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.278
Save for one issue.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.280
I understand you've been
suspended by Homeland.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.347
You no longer carry a weapon.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.349
How do you know that?
I'm MI6.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.687
You should see my file
on this guy.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.289
My point is, when we
breach the room, I take lead.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.892
Understood.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.960
Then, shall we get to it?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.061
Hold on a second.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.263
Cabe, once the team's
into the hacker's computer,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.332
should they focus first
on finding the potential target

10:32.365 --> 10:33.533
so we can start
evacuations in case

10:33.566 --> 10:36.369
something goes wrong and the
satellite can't be reprogrammed?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.071
Is that how you Yanks
go into battle?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.007
Just plan for failure?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.375
Not since the Revolutionary War.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.443
Oh, wait. We won that.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.679
Let me repeat myself.

10:45.713 --> 10:48.849
This might be a joint mission,
but I take lead.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.851
Now, there's no
time to waste.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.201
(trilling)

11:09.970 --> 11:12.139
(whispering): Their signal's
coming from in there.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.913
Don't move!

11:22.783 --> 11:25.118
(Gemma mutters)

11:25.152 --> 11:26.720
Damn it!

11:26.754 --> 11:28.756
(dog barking)

11:31.091 --> 11:33.493
Guys? He had a self-destruct
overload on his laptop.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.928
He made a run for it.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.429
We got to help
track the hacker.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.398
How? We have no idea which
direction he went in!

11:38.431 --> 11:40.768
He's headed for the park!
Come on!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.770
Guess that answers
your question.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.237
(car horn blaring)
Oh.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.442
(tires screech,
horn honks)

11:50.477 --> 11:51.444
(tires squeal)

12:00.821 --> 12:02.322
CABE:
In there!

12:05.158 --> 12:07.127
Hey. All right.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.228
Cover me.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.797
(grunts)

12:20.841 --> 12:22.843
(panting)

12:24.477 --> 12:25.813
Don't move!

12:25.846 --> 12:27.414
You want
to stop the satellite?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.249
You can't do it
without this.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.052
(toilet flushes)

12:33.086 --> 12:36.089
Oh, crap.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.125
♪

12:45.565 --> 12:47.467
(Cabe grunts loudly)

12:47.500 --> 12:49.136
Oh, whoa.
Do you hear that?

12:49.169 --> 12:52.539
(grunting continues)

12:52.572 --> 12:54.875
Not good. Well, that's no
different than the noises

12:54.908 --> 12:56.443
I usually hear when
Cabe's in the bathroom.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.545
Oh, come on!

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
You better have another
one of those things on you,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.883
or I'm gonna send you headfirst
down that crapper to find it!

13:02.916 --> 13:04.551
Another what?!
A digital password fob.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.553
What's a digital
password fob?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.155
HACKER: It links to
the satellite.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.590
Generates a new password
every 90 seconds.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.292
And the only
way to the 19-K.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.226
WALTER:
And we need it,

13:13.260 --> 13:14.928
'cause this laptop's fried.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.563
(grunts)
It's not in there. It's gone.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.465
You're gonna want
to have that arm removed.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.100
Quick, give me
your key chain.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.204
HAPPY'S VOICE:
Attaboy.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.238
What are you doing
with my Attaboy?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.041
(toilet flushes)

13:28.075 --> 13:31.178
See, that's why
I can't have nice things.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.312
Well, after Collins
escaped, I installed GPS

13:32.345 --> 13:34.381
onto your key chain in case
he kidnapped you again.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.985
Do you see how much
this woman loves me?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.087
I just came in
to urinate.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.189
Now I can't.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.090
Get lost.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.094
Okay, so we track
the key chain via GPS.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.062
Well, it shouldn't be
too far behind the fob

13:49.096 --> 13:50.330
since they were
flushed in succession.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.233
Sly, go with Happy and pull up
the schematics for the sewer.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.102
I'll merge those schematics
with the key chain's GPS signal,

13:55.135 --> 13:56.436
and then we'll be able
to track down

13:56.469 --> 13:58.305
exactly which pipe
it is travelling through.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
And it can lead us
to this jerk's fob.

14:00.007 --> 14:00.773
WALTER:
Paige,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.142
Gemma, meet me outside
the motel.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.143
We're going in the sewer.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.144
Oh, lovely.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.178
CABE:
All right.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.379
I'm gonna take
this jackass

14:06.413 --> 14:09.416
back to the garage and see what
info I can get him to spill.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.385
I'll tell you nothing except
the world will soon know

14:12.419 --> 14:15.088
about Imperialist
Britain's illegal weapon.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.289
Yeah, we'll see about that.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.490
I'm gonna go
with him, make sure

14:17.524 --> 14:18.959
he doesn't wind up
killing that guy.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.493
I'll call Homeland.
He may be suspended,

14:20.527 --> 14:21.328
but they should
be alerted.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.663
No. This is a British
operation only.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.166
No one outside your team
is to know.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.203
Paige, I found a manhole
a block from the motel.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.371
You almost here?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.372
PAIGE:
On our way.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.308
Just had a lovely chat
with our new spy friend.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.078
(grunts)

14:38.111 --> 14:40.047
(sighs)

14:40.080 --> 14:41.248
(liquid dripping)

14:41.281 --> 14:42.615
All good! Come on!

14:44.417 --> 14:45.352
Did you see that psycho?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.187
She jumped from, like,
halfway down the ladder.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.322
She's MI6. Untrustworthy
is what she is.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.991
I know, you got a vibe.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.159
I'll talk to her, get a
read, fix everything, okay?

14:52.192 --> 14:53.426
No, not okay.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.163
I am not looking for you to fix
things for me. I'm just venting.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.165
So just support me and say
you understand my frustration.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.333
Oh, okay.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.335
Do you mean
right now or...?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.937
Forget it. Just go.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.338
Oh, okay.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.706
(sighs)

15:06.739 --> 15:08.575
SYLVESTER:
Okay, I pinpointed

15:08.608 --> 15:10.310
your exact location and located

15:10.343 --> 15:12.479
the GPS signal
from the Attaboy key chain.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.081
It's currently flowing
through the pipe

15:14.114 --> 15:17.117
J-37.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.253
PAIGE: Why aren't these pipes
in sequential order?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.223
Stupid Los Angeles.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.228
Here! J-37!

15:28.261 --> 15:29.296
SYLVESTER:
It runs

15:29.329 --> 15:32.332
straight down two stories,
and then north 856 yards.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.567
If you move fast,
you could get ahead of the fob.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.003
You heard him!
Let's move!

15:37.604 --> 15:39.639
All right, keep moving.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.476
Get in there,
sit down and shut up!

15:43.510 --> 15:45.378
Cabe, Cabe, Cabe.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.680
Just give me a minute with him,
I can get him to talk.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.318
I'm not sure your method is the
fastest way to get what we want.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.254
Doc, we got to get him to tell
us where that laser's pointed at

15:54.287 --> 15:56.389
ASAP in case the others can't
find that fob. Totally.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.359
It's just my brain can get the
information we need faster

15:59.392 --> 16:00.727
and more accurately
than your fists can.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.529
You did get me to open up
about my misgivings

16:02.562 --> 16:03.963
about going to prison.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.735
Misgivings. Seven synonyms.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.203
You got to be kidding me.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.540
Guys, it appears

16:13.573 --> 16:15.208
the Attaboy key chain
is slowing down.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.210
(tires squealing)

16:17.244 --> 16:19.012
(engine revving,
horn honks)

16:19.046 --> 16:21.281
Sweet'N Low coffee packets!
That was a red light!

16:21.314 --> 16:23.283
HAPPY: We don't know what could
happen to those guys down there.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.517
We need to stay
close to the fob

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
in case we need to
take their place.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.620
I am only going
to say this once.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.356
There is not a chance
in H-E-double-Wizard-Wands

16:29.389 --> 16:31.358
that I am ever going down
into the sewer!

16:31.391 --> 16:32.525
(beeping)

16:32.559 --> 16:35.195
Guys, the Attaboy key chain
has stopped!

16:35.228 --> 16:38.465
Schematics show
a debris trap up ahead.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.699
If it got stuck there,

16:39.732 --> 16:41.534
then the fob is likely
stuck there, as well.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.570
Uh, we're at the trap,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.638
gonna open up
the cover. Uh, Sly,

16:45.672 --> 16:47.474
once we get the fob,
I will tell you the password,

16:47.507 --> 16:48.608
we can access

16:48.641 --> 16:52.379
the satellite and shut it
down. And Gemma, send Sly

16:52.412 --> 16:54.047
the address
for the secured satellite portal

16:54.081 --> 16:55.748
so that he can pull it up now
and save some time.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.817
He'll get it
when I'm topside with him.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.120
Gemma, we only have 28 minutes.
Every second counts.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.621
He will be accessing
a British satellite.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.356
I need to be present
for every keystroke

17:03.390 --> 17:06.025
to make sure all goes smoothly.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.696
Yes, I know. Your vibe,

17:09.729 --> 17:12.132
but right now, we
need to open the trap.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.835
And, that should do it.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.338
Oh, there's the Attaboy...

17:18.371 --> 17:20.540
in a pile of the grossest stuff
ever flushed down L.A. toilets.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.076
I don't see the fob.
WALTER: Here we are.

17:23.110 --> 17:26.779
There.

17:26.813 --> 17:30.183
(groaning)

17:30.217 --> 17:31.518
Oh, there's a problem.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.619
The screen's torn.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.820
The fob must have
slipped through.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.822
(scoffs) The pipe forks
in two directions.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.857
SYLVESTER:
Pipe on the left heads east,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.292
hooks up to a larger conduit.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.693
Pipe on the right heads west

17:40.727 --> 17:42.195
towards the Hermosa
waste treatment facility.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.431
Okay, I'll go west,
you two go east.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.100
HAPPY:
Uh, don't forget my husband's

17:47.134 --> 17:47.834
Christmas gift!

17:47.867 --> 17:49.136
It's in sewage.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.870
It's a one-of-a-kind trinket.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.871
Go fishing.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.607
Ew.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.143
(groaning)

17:56.176 --> 17:58.278
HAPPY'S VOICE:
Attaboy!

17:58.311 --> 17:59.879
Oh.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.115
(sighs)

18:02.149 --> 18:04.317
(groans)

18:06.353 --> 18:08.621
So why don't you just tell
me where you're from, hmm?

18:08.655 --> 18:11.124
Okay, I know
it's not L.A.,

18:11.158 --> 18:13.293
'cause you'd never let a
weapon of mass destruction

18:13.326 --> 18:15.862
strike where family lives, and,
I mean, even if you'd moved,

18:15.895 --> 18:19.166
there'd be all those emotional
connections to your hometown.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.135
Listen, you're not gonna
shrink me.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.870
Want to know why?

18:23.903 --> 18:27.207
Because the only
emotional connection I have

18:27.240 --> 18:29.242
is to my cause.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.611
And it's a cause
that I and my associates

18:31.644 --> 18:33.546
plan on seeing through.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.847
CABE:
Doc.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.217
Just one second.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.888
Hey...

18:41.921 --> 18:43.390
I just heard from Walter.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.624
They can't find the fob,

18:44.657 --> 18:46.293
so I sure as hell hope
you got good news.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.328
Cabe, this guy,
he-he's an ideologue.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.862
He is hell-bent on
exposing Britain

18:49.896 --> 18:51.698
by having their own satellite
attack the U.S.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.899
I don't think there's
any way he's gonna reveal

18:52.932 --> 18:56.169
the specific target before the
laser's been fired, Cabe.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.937
W-We might be screwed here.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.340
You're right.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.875
As long as he thinks
he hasn't achieved his goals,

19:02.909 --> 19:04.777
he's not gonna
tell us squat.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.480
Cabe, trying to beat
the truth out of him

19:07.514 --> 19:08.748
is not gonna work.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.183
He is intractable.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.752
Don't worry,
I have a plan.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.887
I can make him sing.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.227
Looks like they
sent in the "B" team.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.932
Oh, great job, Cabe.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.400
Better hope he sings
in his sleep.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.277
Wake up!
(sirens approaching)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.716
Looks like things got
interesting while I was out.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.352
Oh, you happy,
you son of a bitch?

19:45.385 --> 19:48.321
The laser fired, and there
is massive destruction,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.457
all because of you
and your friends.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.360
CABE:
Come on, Doc,

19:53.393 --> 19:55.328
you got to get him to talk about
the target's location.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.496
You can do this.
(siren sounds playing)

19:56.529 --> 19:59.799
You... you caused
complete mayhem!

19:59.832 --> 20:01.301
The logistics alone of
fixing what you destroyed

20:01.334 --> 20:03.836
are impossible to figure.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.472
And the dead... (siren and
helicopter sounds playing)

20:05.505 --> 20:08.341
There are countless dead!
Yeah.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.310
And that number's
just gonna get worse.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.412
In a few years, when people
in the fallout zone

20:12.445 --> 20:15.248
start getting sick...

20:15.282 --> 20:17.584
Fallout zone?

20:17.617 --> 20:20.420
Did you hear him?
It's nuclear.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.854
Guys, the target
is nuclear.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.656
We only have about 22 minutes

20:23.690 --> 20:24.691
until the laser show.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.327
There are only three
nuclear facilities in L.A.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.362
You have the nuclear waste
storage depot in Lancaster,

20:29.396 --> 20:30.897
the reactor in Pomona,

20:30.930 --> 20:33.666
and the raw manufacturing plant
in Torrance.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.034
Get the exact location.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.804
If that laser hits
any of those facilities,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.806
then the fallout
could kill millions.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.041
You need to get that fob
before the satellite fires.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.242
PAIGE:
In the process

20:43.276 --> 20:45.512
of doing that right now, but
it's not like it's the key chain

20:45.545 --> 20:46.646
giving us a signal to follow.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.449
Oh, man, yes, it is.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.684
The fob self-generates
its password,

20:51.718 --> 20:53.453
so it must have
a Wi-Fi transmitter.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.421
Check the Wi-Fi locator

20:54.454 --> 20:56.989
on your phone.
If you get close to the fob,

20:57.023 --> 20:58.625
you'll pick up
its Wi-Fi signal.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.360
PAIGE:
Mm, no, nothing yet.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.794
Me neither.

21:01.828 --> 21:06.966
Then we keep moving
till we locate it.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.969
that's lost somewhere in the
massive L.A. sewer system.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.405
The odds are overwhelming
they're not gonna track it down,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.641
so we have to figure out which
of the three nuclear facilities

21:14.674 --> 21:16.476
is in the crosshairs
so we can evacuate.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.944
FLORENCE:
Was I not

21:17.977 --> 21:18.745
direct with you people?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.313
I thought I made
myself very clear.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.350
(siren sound effects
continue playing)

21:23.383 --> 21:25.685
Sirens?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.987
Flashing lights-- is this
some kind of a party?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.056
(trailer door opens)

21:31.558 --> 21:32.625
Oh...

21:33.926 --> 21:34.827
(sirens stop)

21:34.861 --> 21:37.029
It seems that it is
some kind of party.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.698
Uh,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.567
I do not wish
to attend this party.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.869
(grunting)

21:42.902 --> 21:43.803
We can explain.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.838
No need.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.776
Good day.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.914
Okay, she thinks
we kidnapped this guy,

21:54.947 --> 21:56.449
she's gonna call
the actual cops.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.084
They'll take him away from us.
You handle her.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.920
Oh, Florence...

22:00.953 --> 22:02.455
You guys were faking it?

22:02.489 --> 22:03.790
You damn lying cops!

22:03.823 --> 22:05.892
Still got nothing on my phone.
You got anything?

22:05.925 --> 22:08.395
Yes, Paige, I got it,
but I'm not telling you

22:08.428 --> 22:09.762
'cause I'm a double agent.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.664
You really don't
trust me, do you?

22:11.698 --> 22:14.634
Truthfully, no, I don't.
WALTER: Paige,

22:14.667 --> 22:16.636
I think you'd feel
a lot better

22:16.669 --> 22:18.505
if you just focused
on the task at hand.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.773
Damn it, Walter, you focus
on the task at hand.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.509
Don't try to solve
this problem for me.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.611
Gemma, you are hiding something,
and it's more

22:24.644 --> 22:25.745
than just your real name.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.946
It could be benign,
or it could

22:26.979 --> 22:28.047
be bad,
but one thing is for sure,

22:28.080 --> 22:29.482
it is real,
and it is more than

22:29.516 --> 22:30.517
just a vibe I have.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.919
Ooh, I love it when you
Americans give speeches.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.822
So John Wayne.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.990
(trilling)
We got a Wi-Fi signal.

22:38.024 --> 22:38.925
It's got to be the fob.

22:38.958 --> 22:39.959
SYLVESTER:
There's a shutoff valve about

22:39.992 --> 22:41.027
a quarter of a mile north
from where you are.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.128
If you close it before
the fob passes through it,

22:42.161 --> 22:45.765
then you can retrieve it
from a hatch in the pipe,

22:45.798 --> 22:47.467
300 yards from your
current location.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.802
On it. Walter, I'll
meet you at the hatch.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.703
Coming.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.639
Okay, please, just
let me leave, okay?

22:52.672 --> 22:54.674
I told you, we work
for the government.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.843
You have nothing
to be concerned about.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.612
I won't tell anyone
what I saw here today.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.780
That's 'cause you didn't
see anything.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.415
There was nothing untoward
going on here.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.784
I saw a freaky,
terrifying man.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.152
That's just Cabe.
No.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.487
The man that you kidnapped.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.188
You can call Homeland
Security, all right?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.823
They're gonna vouch for us.
We don't kidnap.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.760
We don't hold people
against their will.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.898
All right, look,
I am gonna let you go,

23:18.931 --> 23:21.834
but you need to promise me that
you'll just get in your car

23:21.868 --> 23:24.604
and drive as far as you can
out of Los Angeles.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.974
If you and your
weirdo friends think

23:28.007 --> 23:29.609
that you're going to
intimidate me into moving

23:29.642 --> 23:31.844
when I just set up my lab,

23:31.878 --> 23:34.514
you are mistaken, sir.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.586
Disengaging the shutoff valve
now!

23:39.619 --> 23:41.721
Okay, we're at the hatch.
And the fob has to be in it

23:41.754 --> 23:42.989
because I'm getting
a real strong Wi-Fi signal.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.224
It's the strongest one yet.
Oh!

23:45.257 --> 23:48.060
Oh...

23:48.094 --> 23:49.696
(groans)
All right.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.733
Okay, it should be in here,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.535
but it's real dark,
it's hard to see.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.470
Oh, I think I see
a blinking light.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.907
Can you shine your
phone on it, please?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.074
(rat squeaks loudly)
Whoa!

24:02.108 --> 24:03.643
A rat's got the fob! Get it!

24:04.877 --> 24:05.845
Okay...

24:05.878 --> 24:07.614
(squeaking)

24:07.647 --> 24:09.081
I got it cornered.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.684
Oh, it must be attracted
to the slight vibrations

24:11.718 --> 24:12.985
emanating from the fob.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.554
It won't give it up
without a fight.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.555
PAIGE:
Oh, great.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.490
I have to tell
you something.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.726
When I was on real hard
times, Ralph and I stayed

24:19.759 --> 24:21.160
at a rat-infested
motel for a month,

24:21.193 --> 24:22.862
and I developed a deep-seated
fear of these things.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.969
You know, I am so sorry
to hear about that.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.972
I understand your fears,
and I validate them.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.006
I am not looking
for your understanding,

24:34.040 --> 24:36.208
just solve the damn problem
and grab the rat.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.810
I have no idea what you want
me to do anymore.

24:37.844 --> 24:38.911
Grab the rat!
Fine!

24:38.945 --> 24:40.847
(squeaking)

24:40.880 --> 24:42.148
(screams)
Paige, grab the rat!

24:44.551 --> 24:46.686
Oh, my God! Oh...

24:51.924 --> 24:54.026
Uh, there's a drain back here.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.962
The little sucker got
swept off into the river.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.129
It's gone.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.699
Rats.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.773
That drain leads to the Hermosa
sewerage treatment plant.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.541
It empties out
into a holding tank

25:08.575 --> 25:12.078
that grinds up the debris
that's been washed downstream.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.681
If we don't get that rat
before it reaches that facility,

25:14.714 --> 25:17.149
th-then the rat and the fob
will be ground to bits.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.084
HAPPY: And we'll have
a nuclear disaster

25:18.117 --> 25:20.319
on our hands,
'cause the satellite fires

25:20.352 --> 25:22.855
in, uh, 16 minutes.
Okay, we're not far

25:22.889 --> 25:24.824
from the treatment facility
now-- meet us there.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.129
Socket wrench.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.833
Ball-peen hammer.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.940
Hacksaw.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.547
Happy sure does have
some nice tools.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.283
Cabe, can you
step outside a minute?

25:51.317 --> 25:54.153
Yeah.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.755
Be right back.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.727
What is that, a stud finder?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.328
You know, I can't
go near those things.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.896
They always go off.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.698
CABE:
Doc!

26:07.399 --> 26:09.301
Are you crazy? What's the
deal with those tools?

26:09.335 --> 26:11.337
I was just trying
to scare the guy into talking.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.873
I wasn't gonna
hurt him... yet.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.809
Cabe, he and his ilk,
they are anarchists.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.878
Maybe you could
break him eventually,

26:18.911 --> 26:20.913
but they've prepped for the
rough stuff if captured.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.782
We don't have the time
to wait it out.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.918
Wait, you got an idea?
Just spit it out.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.253
No, no, no, no, no.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.855
It's not my idea,
it's his idea.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.823
Follow my logic.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.692
If you're a
violent nutjob,

26:32.725 --> 26:34.226
and you want to
really hurt people,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.162
you come up with the
most horrible thing

26:36.195 --> 26:37.664
you could do
to someone, right?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.966
Like laser a nuclear facility.
Yeah.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.367
You plan it, and
then you repeat it

26:41.400 --> 26:43.102
over and over
in your head

26:43.135 --> 26:45.337
till you can almost feel
the horror that you're

26:45.371 --> 26:46.605
gonna cause others.
I mean, in fact,

26:46.639 --> 26:49.909
this was so awful that, when you
come to after being knocked out,

26:49.942 --> 26:51.811
you almost instantly mention
the nuclear fallout--

26:51.844 --> 26:52.845
how it's gonna
riddle your victims

26:52.879 --> 26:53.980
with radiation poisoning.

26:54.013 --> 26:57.416
Now, can you imagine
how he would react

26:57.449 --> 26:59.652
if his most terrible plan
was turned on him?

26:59.686 --> 27:01.888
I got to find a map.
Where you going?

27:01.921 --> 27:04.156
That dirtbag's gonna
get radiation poisoning.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.426
And the tools were too much?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.195
(tires screeching)

27:13.866 --> 27:16.402
Come on, we got to find
the entry hatch

27:16.435 --> 27:17.770
down to the holding tank.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.637
Didn't you hear me
when I said

27:18.671 --> 27:20.172
there's no way
I'm going into the sewer?

27:20.206 --> 27:21.841
Move it, you baby.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.460
Is that the pipe
that's fed from the drain?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.896
According to the schematics.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.966
Okay, grab a skimmer
and hold it under that pipe.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.068
I'm gonna lean over the rail
and try to find

27:49.101 --> 27:50.837
a Wi-Fi signal on my phone

27:50.870 --> 27:52.471
so we'll know when
the rat's coming out.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.840
I get to touch a rat?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.942
This just keeps getting better.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.110
TOBY:
See that?

27:58.144 --> 28:00.012
Those are the three

28:00.046 --> 28:02.414
nuclear facilities in L.A.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.450
I've drawn a 30-mile
fallout radius

28:04.483 --> 28:06.285
around each one.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.455
Nowhere near us,
but you already knew that.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.357
But right here,

28:11.390 --> 28:12.524
where they intersect,

28:12.558 --> 28:16.028
that is where there's going
to be substantial fallout

28:16.062 --> 28:17.764
no matter which location is hit.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.131
And guess what?

28:19.165 --> 28:20.800
That's where you're going, pal.

28:20.833 --> 28:24.470
Uh, you can't do that.
You're cops.

28:24.503 --> 28:27.874
Am I? The British bird
had a gun and a badge.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.777
I'm not carrying anything.
I'm no cop, dummy.

28:30.810 --> 28:31.911
TOBY: And me,
I'm just a shrink,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.479
a genius, and,
from what I'm told,

28:33.512 --> 28:34.947
CABE:
And I'm a suspended agent

28:34.981 --> 28:37.249
with no badge, no gun,

28:37.283 --> 28:40.319
no job and no reason
not to drag your sorry ass

28:40.352 --> 28:41.788
to nuke central.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.790
TOBY: See, what we're
gonna do is, uh,

28:43.823 --> 28:46.225
gag you and then tie you up.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.295
And then, we're gonna leave
you in the trunk of a car

28:49.328 --> 28:51.898
with the taillight kicked in
so that you can breathe in

28:51.931 --> 28:55.267
all that nastiness you've
unleashed on the city.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.502
All that ungodly hell

28:56.535 --> 28:58.437
you imagined would happen
to your victims,

28:58.470 --> 28:59.538
it's gonna happen to you.

28:59.571 --> 29:04.476
Yeah, you'll be hoisted upon
your own nuclear petard.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.780
Have you ever seen what
radioactive exposure does

29:07.814 --> 29:09.015
to the respiratory system?

29:09.048 --> 29:11.083
Whew...

29:11.117 --> 29:15.988
(whispers): Bronchogenic
carcinoma is ugly business.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.092
Let's go for a ride.
All right, all right, all right.

29:20.126 --> 29:23.529
The target is a nuclear
power plant in Pomona.

29:23.562 --> 29:27.099
Guys, the target is
the Pomona nuclear power plant.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.902
Repeat, the Pomona
nuclear power plant.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.403
Copy that,
my enthusiastic lover.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.105
Yeah, we heard it all.
Okay, good work.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.974
Uh, Cabe, call the PD.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.943
Have the area evacuated.
Already on it.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.477
Sly, I need your tablet.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.447
Can you give him my tablet?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.816
Don't drop it.

29:43.850 --> 29:47.453
Uh, no offense, Walter, I think
I should probably catch it.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.388
I concur.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.823
One, two, three.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.992
Okay, good work.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.427
Now, Gemma, I need you to
get me onto the satellite

29:55.461 --> 29:58.865
for the control portal
so that when we get the fob,

29:58.898 --> 30:00.867
we can enter in the password
and shut down the laser.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.301
Four minutes until
detonation.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.936
Where the hell is
that damn rat?

30:03.970 --> 30:05.872
It's got to be on its way out
any second

30:05.905 --> 30:08.007
'cause my Wi-Fi is at full bars.
Sly, get ready.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.541
(grunts)

30:16.182 --> 30:17.917
(rat squeaks)

30:20.552 --> 30:22.554
(squeaking)

30:25.124 --> 30:26.926
(laughing):
Yes!

30:26.959 --> 30:27.894
Nice work, Sly!

30:29.128 --> 30:30.897
(screaming)

30:32.098 --> 30:33.399
Sly!
Sly!

30:38.070 --> 30:39.906
Help!

30:42.975 --> 30:43.943
Sly!

30:43.976 --> 30:45.978
Help me!

30:51.951 --> 30:53.185
WALTER: Sly, don't let
the force pull you under

30:53.219 --> 30:55.587
or the grinder
will tear you apart!

30:55.621 --> 30:57.323
Help!

30:57.356 --> 30:59.258
(blades whirring)

30:59.291 --> 31:00.259
TOBY:
Well, move parallel

31:00.292 --> 31:02.161
to the water's pull--
if you fight it too much,

31:02.194 --> 31:03.462
you're gonna get exhausted
and go under.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.935
Find that fob. The satellite
fires in two minutes!

31:08.968 --> 31:11.037
Don't think I can
stay up much longer!

31:13.105 --> 31:14.941
Help!

31:17.143 --> 31:18.377
(gurgling):
Help me!

31:19.445 --> 31:20.947
I think I lost the rat!

31:20.980 --> 31:23.249
Um, no you didn't.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.384
(rat squeaking)

31:25.417 --> 31:27.053
(shouting)

31:27.086 --> 31:30.456
Mr. Rodent, be cool.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.524
(grunting)

31:32.558 --> 31:33.692
Oh.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.594
Oh, I got it.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.929
Here!

31:39.431 --> 31:41.934
"91287656."

31:41.968 --> 31:43.402
Okay.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.405
I'm in control of the satellite.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.141
Help!

31:51.510 --> 31:52.644
Sly's losing strength.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.346
WALTER: Damn it, final countdown
protocol's already begun.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.016
I-I can't stop
the laser from firing.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.985
Walter!

31:59.018 --> 32:00.519
Do something.
Uh, uh...

32:00.552 --> 32:02.554
Toby, how thick
is the concrete shield

32:02.588 --> 32:04.223
around the Pomona reactor?
All right,

32:04.256 --> 32:05.691
pulling up the specs
on the public works site now.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.259
Why?
'Cause I am gonna

32:07.293 --> 32:08.494
redirect the laser to strike

32:08.527 --> 32:10.329
where we are now.
PAIGE: What?

32:10.362 --> 32:12.031
It'll kill all of us.
No. It will save

32:12.064 --> 32:13.499
both the nuclear reactor
and Sly.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.001
If the laser
hits a reactor,

32:15.034 --> 32:16.368
the nuclear material
will cause an explosion,

32:16.402 --> 32:18.370
but there are no
munitions in here.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.738
It would be a
surgical strike

32:19.771 --> 32:22.008
on the motor running the
gears below Sly's feet.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.509
I follow your thinking, boss,
and I like it.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.011
Waitress, give me
my husband's key chain.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.216
(groans)

32:31.450 --> 32:33.352
(quietly):
Okay.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.124
HAPPY'S VOICE:
Attaboy.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.725
More like attagirl.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.160
20 seconds.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.161
CABE:
Concrete casing

32:42.194 --> 32:43.595
is 12 feet thick.
WALTER: Good.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.564
This facility's only half that;
the laser will penetrate.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.199
I hope you know
what you're doing.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.268
Uh, me, too, because I'm done
redirecting the laser

32:49.301 --> 32:51.770
to fire on the GPS coordinates
of the key chain.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.738
Ten seconds!

32:52.771 --> 32:54.173
Uh, everybody get down.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.174
PAIGE:
But you said we

32:55.207 --> 32:56.575
couldn't explode!
Yeah, I know, but y-you know.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.743
Space laser.

32:57.776 --> 32:58.977
In five seconds!

33:00.412 --> 33:02.481
SYLVESTER:
Walter!

33:04.550 --> 33:05.551
(rumbling)

33:18.430 --> 33:20.199
I'm okay!

33:20.232 --> 33:21.367
I'm okay, I'm okay.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.369
Sly! Just hold on a bit, pal.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.504
We're gonna get a rope
to pull you out.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.139
Could you hurry up?

33:27.173 --> 33:30.309
There's a rat swimming around
down here with me.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.344
Yeah.
(rat squeaking)

33:38.584 --> 33:39.685
Bro, you're gonna
take your skin off.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.553
I am forever unclean.

33:41.587 --> 33:42.754
GEMMA: Agent Gleason
thanks you all

33:42.788 --> 33:43.722
for your incredible work today.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.124
As do parliament

33:45.157 --> 33:46.525
and the royal family.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.526
The royal family?

33:47.559 --> 33:49.061
Hey, that's not bad.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.062
Uh, Gemma?

33:50.096 --> 33:51.063
When I was in control

33:51.097 --> 33:53.732
of the satellite, I
noticed coding patterns

33:53.765 --> 33:56.368
that were clearly
not British.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.437
Not even Western.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.040
That wasn't a British satellite,
was it?

34:03.475 --> 34:04.576
No.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.445
But it is now.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.117
Be well, Scorpion.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.856
(door closes)

34:17.889 --> 34:20.726
She tricked us into stealing
a satellite for MI6!

34:20.759 --> 34:24.563
I told you I had a vibe about
her. I'm calling Homeland.

34:24.596 --> 34:28.234
Paige, um, I'm still figuring
out our relationship,

34:28.267 --> 34:31.537
but one thing I know for certain
is you know people.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.640
You have a vibe, I take note.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.575
So when I was controlling
the satellite,

34:36.608 --> 34:37.543
I changed its orbit.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.811
It'll spin into deep
space within six hours.

34:39.845 --> 34:42.281
It's useless to them.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.686
Are you mad that
I solved your problem?

34:50.622 --> 34:51.890
Course not.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.292
You trusted me.

34:53.325 --> 34:56.262
I'm never gonna figure this out.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.296
Welcome to women, son.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.397
England's gonna be mad.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.532
They let hackers compromise
it; they weren't ready

35:00.566 --> 35:02.434
for such a weapon.
Oh, man. I better make sure

35:02.468 --> 35:03.835
that payment from MI6
wired through

35:03.869 --> 35:05.437
before they find out
what you did.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.244
(buffer stops)

35:23.422 --> 35:24.790
HAPPY'S VOICE:
Attaboy.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.158
TOBY:
Hey.

35:26.192 --> 35:29.361
A new Attaboy.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.796
(quietly):
That's my girl.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.166
HAPPY:
Hey, roomie.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.934
Ha, "roomie."

35:35.967 --> 35:37.636
Those were good times.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.671
Even if you did
cheat at board games.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.476
What?

35:45.477 --> 35:46.612
Listen, dummy.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.447
Take it from me.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.950
Being closed off is not the best
way to deal with your problems.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.220
I'm not closed off.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.254
Come on, man.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.190
You're "bank on Sunday" closed.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.660
Is this coming from Toby?

36:01.693 --> 36:02.494
You'd think
he was charging me

36:02.528 --> 36:04.530
the way he wants
to keep me in therapy.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.832
And our talks are confidential.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.367
All he said

36:08.400 --> 36:10.369
was you quit sessions
and he's worried.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.671
'Cause he cares about you,
and I do, too.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.241
And I know that if I had
something going on

36:15.274 --> 36:16.308
that a doctor needed to look at,

36:16.342 --> 36:18.910
you'd drag me to the hospital
if I wouldn't go.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.382
Okay, you better be back
in the trailer tomorrow,

36:23.415 --> 36:24.683
or I'll drag you there myself.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.266
Money's deposited. We're good.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.768
(Paige clears throat)

36:45.304 --> 36:46.505
(whispers):
What's, um...

36:46.538 --> 36:47.473
what's Ralph working on?

36:47.506 --> 36:49.275
A gift for Patty.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.909
It's an atomic watch.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.011
Oh, I hate this crush.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.281
She's too old for him,
and she's gonna break his heart.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.949
Can't you say something
genius to cool his jets?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.952
Yes, but I won't.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.355
Paige, the reason

37:03.389 --> 37:07.826
why I am so clueless, uh,
with relationships as an adult

37:07.859 --> 37:11.930
is because I never experimented
with them when I was a kid.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.566
Now, do you really want Ralph
to end up the same way

37:14.600 --> 37:16.402
that you found me
three years ago?

37:16.435 --> 37:18.437
No, I... I just don't
want him to get hurt.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.839
Sounds like you're trying
to solve his problem.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.642
Maybe we should just
support him?

37:23.675 --> 37:26.545
Don't use my words against me.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.679
Okay, well,

37:27.713 --> 37:30.316
with respect to Patty, I'm going
to withhold my judgment

37:30.349 --> 37:31.550
until I have all the facts.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.420
PATTY: Sylvester, let's go.
Council meeting in 20 minutes.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.522
Well, get ready
to collect some data.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.957
We're debating pooper-
scooper legislation.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.526
Great. More poop.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.428
Let me just pack up.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.696
Hey, Patty. I
made this for you.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.465
An atomic watch.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.500
Know how much you care
about punctuality,

37:48.534 --> 37:51.637
so, you'll never have to stress
about being late again.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.739
Cool. Thanks, kiddo.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.478
(quietly):
Nice work.

37:59.511 --> 38:02.514
My woman had a problem,
and I solved it.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.653
I don't know where he got that.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.988
(door opens)

38:11.957 --> 38:14.460
We got to start
locking that door.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.627
TOBY:
Hey, Flo.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.662
What can we do for you?

38:16.695 --> 38:17.596
FLORENCE:
It's Florence.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.766
I tried to get out
of my lease. I cannot.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.468
So I think
that we need to

38:22.501 --> 38:23.635
lay down some ground rules.

38:23.669 --> 38:24.736
One,

38:24.770 --> 38:26.905
quiet is important to me,
so I would appreciate it

38:26.938 --> 38:29.475
if you kept it down
when possible.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.444
Sounds reasonable.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.881
And I agree that I will
reach out to you first,

38:35.914 --> 38:38.917
before using chemical warfare,
so to speak.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.352
Also reasonable.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.453
Though I will knock

38:41.487 --> 38:43.455
before entering, so that I don't

38:43.489 --> 38:44.623
interrupt your activities

38:44.656 --> 38:47.526
with any more bound
and gagged men.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.995
I assure you,
that rarely happens.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.463
PAIGE: You know,
you can even knock

38:51.497 --> 38:52.564
when we're being quiet.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.999
Just to stop by
and grab some coffee.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.401
We're neighbors, right?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.437
Okay.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.944
When I was in high school,

39:05.977 --> 39:08.480
the chemistry lab
was next to the gym.

39:08.514 --> 39:12.451
Kids used to throw basketballs
at the wall to disturb my work.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.862
She sounds like us.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.533
See? Just needed
to give her a chance.

39:27.566 --> 39:32.103
Well, I'm withholding judgment
until I have more facts.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.645
(insects chirping, cat meows)

39:44.683 --> 39:46.051
Hey.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.754
Hey.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.658
Well?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.593
"Well," what?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.528
Look at me, Walter. I...

39:56.562 --> 39:58.063
I didn't have
any of my beauty products.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.398
Don't you see why
I need all that stuff now?

40:02.468 --> 40:04.636
I see absolutely no difference.

40:04.670 --> 40:05.904
You're kidding me.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.105
No.

40:07.138 --> 40:10.776
All I see is the most beautiful
woman that I have ever seen.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.546
I-I truly see no difference.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.483
You know how
you were confused today

40:17.516 --> 40:19.150
about the right thing
or the wrong thing to say?

40:20.586 --> 40:23.555
You just said
the exact right thing.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.497
Ow.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.164
I-I think I have my hand
stuck in your hair...

40:33.198 --> 40:34.900
I know, just don't pull-- ow, ow.
Okay.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.167
Ow.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.537
Yeah.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.672
Maybe a slight difference
without the conditioner.

40:40.706 --> 40:41.773
(both laugh softly)
