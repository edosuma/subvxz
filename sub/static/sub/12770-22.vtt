OF PEDIATRICS STATES...

BRAIN DEATH HAS TO BE MADE

04:23.959 --> 04:25.500
BEFORE PROCURING THE ORGANS.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.041

IN A CHILD THAT'S ANENCEPHALIC--

04:28.083 --> 04:29.667
AND STILL MEDICAL ETHICISTS
ARE SPLIT

04:29.709 --> 04:32.083

TO RETRIEVE ORGANS FROM THEM.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.917
WHY NOT JUST WAIT
TILL THE BABY DIES?

04:33.959 --> 04:35.750
(Addison) BECAUSE BY THEN,
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.125

BE VIABLE FOR TRANSPLANT.

YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.875
I... I JUST WANT
TO HELP YOU--

07:53.917 --> 07:56.000

TO FEEL GUILTY.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.000

BRAIN DEATH

08:07.500 --> 08:10.125
LACK OF REFLEXES,
PUPILLARY RESPONSES.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.959
NO. THOSE CRITERIA
DON'T APPLY HERE.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.291
THEY INDICATE AN ABSENCE
OF BRAIN STEM ACTIVITY.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.750
AMELIA'S BABY HAS
A RUDIMENTARY BRAIN STEM.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.083
IT'LL NEVER
GAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.333
(Jake) EXACTLY.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.750
THERE IS ZERO CHANCE
IT WILL EVER HAVE

08:21.792 --> 08:23.083
ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL LIFE.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.041
WILL YOU STOP SAYING "IT"?
(sighs)

08:25.083 --> 08:27.709
BECAUSE THE BABY
WILL BE ALIVE.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.583
IT'S NOT A LIFE I'D WANT,
BUT IT'S NOT A LIFE I'D KILL.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.083
STOP SAYING "IT."
SAY "HE."

08:33.125 --> 08:35.917

08:35.959 --> 08:38.542

TO RECOVER THE ORGANS.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.125
LOOK, SAM, I NEED YOUR HELP

08:40.166 --> 08:42.166
TO HARVEST THE HEART
AND THE LUNGS.

08:42.208 --> 08:45.208
AMELIA NEEDS YOUR HELP.

I WANT TO HELP,

08:56.083 --> 08:57.542
SHOULD I CALL DEREK?

08:57.583 --> 08:59.542
NO, SHE EXPRESSLY ASKED ME
NOT TO CALL HER FAMILY.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.208
SHE WANTS TO DO THIS
ON HER OWN.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.834
WELL, I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
I CAN'T JUST--

09:02.875 --> 09:04.834
I-I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.000
LITTLE PRISON HUMOR.
SORRY.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.041
ROBERTA'S GONNA APPEAL
THE JUDGE'S DECISION.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.500
SHE SAYS YOU SHOULD GET BAIL.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.667
SHE SAID THAT THE JUDGE
WAS PREJUDICED.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.208
THAT JUDGE WAS AN ASS.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.041
HEY, PETE, I'M FREAKING OUT
HERE, OKAY?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.417
I'M FREAKING OUT. I--
OKAY, OKAY.

09:39.959 --> 09:41.333
HEY.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.041
I LOVE YOU.

HE MISSES YOU.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.917
I TOLD HIM THAT YOU WERE
OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE.

09:54.959 --> 09:58.917
WE SHOULDN'T LIE.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.083
WE SHOULDN'T LIE?

PETE?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.709

10:03.750 --> 10:05.417
DADDY'S IN JAIL BECAUSE THAT'S

10:05.458 --> 10:06.625

ACCUSED MURDERERS?

10:06.667 --> 10:08.041

10:08.083 --> 10:09.250
(normal voice) YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING BY YOUR PATIENT.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.750
YOU DID NOT DO THE RIGHT THING
BY OUR FAMILY.

10:11.792 --> 10:14.458
YOU DID NOT DO THE RIGHT THING
BY OUR SON.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.834
YOU NEED TO COOPERATE.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.959
I WILL NOT SAY
THAT I'M SORRY.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.375
PETE, I GET
THAT YOU'RE NOT SORRY.

10:23.417 --> 10:26.041
I DON'T NEED YOU TO BE SORRY.
I NEED YOU TO NOT BE IN PRISON.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.041
SO PLEASE SAY WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO SAY.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.583
COOPERATE.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.375
(Addison)
BAIL WAS DENIED ENTIRELY?

10:34.417 --> 10:36.291
YEAH, ENTIRELY.
BUT THEY'RE APPEALING THAT,
RIGHT? THEY CAN APPEAL THAT.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.709
THEY ARE.
BECAUSE IT SEEMS
A LITTLE EXTREME.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.000
WELL, HE DID KILL SOMEONE.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.875
S-SOMEONE WHO WASN'T
GOING TO RECOVER,

10:41.917 --> 10:43.542
SOMEONE WHO'S PARTNER
HAD ASKED HIM TO--

10:43.583 --> 10:44.959
PETE KNEW THE LAW.
HE BROKE THE LAW.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.166
AND HE PUT HIMSELF

10:46.208 --> 10:47.500
AND THE HOSPITAL AT RISK
WHEN HE DID IT.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.667
THIS IS NOT HELPFUL.
CAN WE NOT--

10:49.709 --> 10:52.875
CAN WE JUST NOT...
DEBATE IT FOR ONCE?

10:52.917 --> 10:54.041
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.041
AMELIA'S IN A VERY BAD PLACE.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.542
DID YOU JUST SEE HER?

10:57.583 --> 10:59.208
I COULDN'T STAY AWAY
EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST POSSIBLE

10:59.250 --> 11:01.125
THAT SHE HATES ME
ENOUGH TO KILL ME.
YEAH, IF I DON'T DO IT FIRST.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.083
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO SEE HER
IF YOU COULDN'T BE SUPPORTIVE.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.709
I WAS SUPPORTING HER.
(Charlotte) THE ARGUMENT
IS POINTLESS.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.834
THE HOSPITAL STILL HASN'T SIGNED
OFF ON THE ORGAN PROCUREMENT.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.125
AND THEY SHOULDN'T.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.542

HOW MANY BABIES DIE EVER YEAR

11:11.583 --> 11:13.333

(Jake) CHARLOTTE,

11:13.375 --> 11:15.041

A GOOD IDEA?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.041
WHO'S AGAINST?

11:20.083 --> 11:22.041

11:22.083 --> 11:23.542
WE'RE SPLIT
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.333
AREN'T WE A MICROCOSM
OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY?

11:26.375 --> 11:29.208
I HATE MY JOB.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.667
SAM, THIS ORGAN PROCUREMENT
HAS TO BE FLAWLESS.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.583
EVERY SURGERY
HAS TO BE FLAWLESS.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.125
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

11:45.166 --> 11:47.041
IT'S HER BABY'S HEART.

11:47.083 --> 11:51.375
IT'S A BABY'S HEART,
AND WHEN WE GET ONE...

11:51.417 --> 11:53.041
LOOK, IF IT WERE ME,

11:53.083 --> 11:55.959
THERE'S NO ONE I'D RATHER HAVE
HOLDING THE SCALPEL THAN YOU.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.041
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
IT ISN'T YOU, THEN, ISN'T IT?
OH, SAM.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.542
LOOK, AMELIA'S SITUATION
IS TRAGIC.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.375
BUT JUST BECAUSE HER BABY'S
GOING TO DIE

12:04.417 --> 12:06.166
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S OKAY
FOR ME TO...

12:06.208 --> 12:07.792
RUSH THE PROCESS.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.917
SAM, I KNOW I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO THE HARD THING HERE,

12:10.959 --> 12:13.041
BUT WHEN PEOPLE WE LOVE
NEED US,

12:13.083 --> 12:14.834
SOMETIMES
WE HAVE TO COMPROMISE.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.375
TODAY'S LECTURE'S
ON COMPROMISE?

12:16.417 --> 12:18.583
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
THE LAST ONE,

12:18.625 --> 12:20.667
YOU SAID, UH,
IF I WASN'T ALL IN,

12:20.709 --> 12:22.250
THEN I HAD TO JUST WALK AWAY.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.166
SO WHICH ONE IS IT, ADDISON?

12:24.208 --> 12:26.041
I KNOW YOU SAW
ME AND JAKE,

12:26.083 --> 12:27.500
AND I PROBABLY OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION--

12:27.542 --> 12:29.500
NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN

12:29.542 --> 12:31.709
WHY YOU GAVE AN ULTIMATUM,

12:31.750 --> 12:35.041
AND WHEN I COULDN'T ANSWER
FOR FIVE SECONDS,

12:35.083 --> 12:38.041

TO SOMEONE ELSE.

12:38.083 --> 12:41.208
THAT DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY
DOESN'T DEMAND AN EXPLANATION.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.208
YOUR INABILITY TO ANSWER,
SAM,

12:43.250 --> 12:44.750
THAT WAS MY ANSWER.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.041
LOOK,
I DON'T WANT TO TALK--

18:47.542 --> 18:51.250
I MEAN, I'VE DEALT WITH CASES
SO MUCH WORSE THAN THIS, BUT...

18:51.291 --> 18:53.250
EVERY TIME I TRY
TO GO IN THERE, I JUST--

18:53.291 --> 18:55.792
I JUST...

18:55.834 --> 18:57.875
CAN'T GET MYSELF TO DO IT.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.000
I CAN'T DO IT EITHER.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.875
BEEN AVOIDING IT.

19:03.917 --> 19:06.375
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY,
AND THEN...

19:06.417 --> 19:09.000
(sighs) THIS MORNING,

19:09.041 --> 19:12.375
I WAS LOOKING AT MASON,
AND I REALIZED--

19:12.417 --> 19:15.500
YOU'RE A MOTHER.

19:15.542 --> 19:18.041
WE CAN'T GO IN THERE
BECAUSE WE'RE MOTHERS.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.750
MASON'S CHANGED ME.

19:20.792 --> 19:23.959
HENRY'S CHANGED YOU.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.709
WE'RE SOFTER. (chuckles)

19:27.750 --> 19:29.083
(chuckles)

19:29.125 --> 19:31.041
I JUST REALIZED, THIS PAST YEAR,
THAT YOU AND I

19:31.083 --> 19:32.417
BOTH BECAME MOTHERS

19:32.458 --> 19:36.041
WITHOUT EVER GIVING BIRTH.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.041
AND SHE'S GONNA GIVE BIRTH...

19:38.083 --> 19:40.000
NOT GET TO BE A MOTHER.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.208
DID VIOLET SEND YOU TO TELL ME
TO COOPERATE?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.041
NO.
TO TELL ME
TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT...

19:47.083 --> 19:48.166
NO.
OR BETTER YET,
TO TELL ME TO APOLOGIZE?

19:48.208 --> 19:51.041
MY SON'S MOTHER DIED.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.041
(indistinct conversations)

19:53.083 --> 19:54.250
(exhales)

19:54.291 --> 19:56.041
I KNOW. I-I WAS THERE.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.417
SHE DOESN'T GET TO GO TO
ANY SPECIAL LUNCHES AT SCHOOL,

19:58.458 --> 20:00.417
OR SEE THE SCIENCE PROJECTS
HE BRINGS HOME,

20:00.458 --> 20:04.041
OR SEE HIM IN THE SCHOOL PLAY,
OR DROP HIM OFF AT BOY SCOUTS.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.000
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'D DO

20:06.041 --> 20:07.959
JUST FOR A CHANCE
TO BE THERE,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.041
TO SEE ALL THAT?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.834
YOU THINK MAYBE
SHE'D SWALLOW HER PRIDE?

20:11.875 --> 20:13.041
DO YOU THINK
SHE'D KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT?

20:13.083 --> 20:15.834
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE SHE'D EVEN APOLOGIZE

20:15.875 --> 20:18.625
EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T THINK
SHE DID ANYTHING WRONG?

20:18.667 --> 20:21.166

COOPER, BUT--

WHO'S BEEN ON
