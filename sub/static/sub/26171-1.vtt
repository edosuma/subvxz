01:51.528 --> 01:54.197
- Do you know what this is?
- Uh...

01:54.281 --> 01:55.949
It’s a toothbrush holder.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.035
Right. Yeah.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.705
You could just get a regular cup.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.123
Yeah.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.667
I want something a little more...

02:06.001 --> 02:07.961
- Uh...
- Many choices.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.549
- Look.
- It’s a little big for a toothbrush,

02:12.633 --> 02:13.508
but it might work.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.470
I don’t know. I’m thinking
of getting some dental work done.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.484
Jesus.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.832
1.99 per pound.

03:27.082 --> 03:30.419
Pound. Make sure
you hit the "D" on the end of pound.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.214
"Where she buy some coffee."

03:38.719 --> 03:41.304
God. Can you believe
these are still in bloom?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.182
Oh! Those are nice.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.393
I can put these on your table if you like.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.811
I don’t care. It’s up to you.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.442
So, uh, how’s it going?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.277
Good. I’m just kind of tired.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.781
It’s only 11, Preston.
Are you enjoying it at least?

03:59.865 --> 04:02.534
- Yeah. I like it a lot, actually.
- Oh, good.

04:03.034 --> 04:06.329
Are you going to go to the Ashford’s
tonight? Just for old time's sake?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.957
Uh... I’m good.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.212
Can a mother still kiss her son?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.047
It’s so fun having you here.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.264
I’m very proud of you.
Everyone likes you.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.058
- Yeah, well, they kind of have to.
- No. That’s not true.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.312
- Never mind. I guess it’s true...
- All right.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.833
Hi, there. I’m Sandy, if you need anything.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.545
- That’s great, isn’t it?
- Well...

04:55.629 --> 04:57.005
Is this a real lobster trap?

04:57.255 --> 05:00.801
No. No. But trust me,
you wouldn’t want it if it was.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.970
Makes a nice decorative
accent though, don’t you think?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.681
I’m looking for things
to put on my shelves.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.351
Oh! You have a new place?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.559
Yeah.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.144
Starting over.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.982
- Taking the day off work, I guess?
- Oh, no. No...

05:17.818 --> 05:19.236
Actually, I’m retired.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.288
I think it’s out.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.082
No, it’s good. I think it’s...

05:36.628 --> 05:40.090
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
This never happens to me.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.551
I mean, this is not your fault.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.074
I didn’t think that it was my fault.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.720
Good. Because it’s not.

05:45.804 --> 05:46.805
Right. I know.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.216
Anders?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.513
You came. A surprise.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.308
Yeah. Thanks for inviting me.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.436
Of course. Why don’t you grab yourself
a drink in the other room?

06:43.987 --> 06:44.987
Wes.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.533
I heard you got out of finance.

06:48.908 --> 06:49.951
I’m jealous.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.076
Well...

06:51.828 --> 06:53.997
Quit your job, Wes.
That’s all you gotta do.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.957
You make it sound so easy.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.459
I mean...

06:57.751 --> 07:00.629
You’re a relatively young guy.
Why get out so early?

07:00.837 --> 07:03.590
- Do you really want to know?
- Sure.

07:04.966 --> 07:05.966
Let me have it.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.259
Well...

07:07.802 --> 07:12.015
It’s a system of monstrous greed,
and that’s the business.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.017
Save yourself.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.478
Do over the other guy.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.023
And don’t worry about the consequences.
And for what?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.817
More toys? Bigger houses?

07:22.901 --> 07:26.571
Trip to the goddamn Caribbean?
Fake titties? No, thank you.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.525
So, you have some big plans?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.283
Yeah, I’m doing, uh...

07:30.367 --> 07:33.203
I'm doing a little decorating
at the moment. You know, condo living.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.081
- You enjoying that?
- Not at all. Would you?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.499
I wouldn’t retire.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.252
Well, I also got some, you know,
charity work going on.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.587
- Oh? Which one?
- Yeah.

07:43.338 --> 07:48.343
Uh... Disease. Diseases.
You know, in the cancer spectrum.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.766
What the hell is he doing here?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.310
I just saw him ear raping Wes Thompson.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.812
Well, just...

07:59.354 --> 08:02.816
The one time he doesn’t have to be here,
in fact shouldn’t be here, and here he is.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.043
I shouldn’t have sent him the invite.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.361
He was on the list.
I wasn’t paying attention.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.531
It’s okay. It's just... He makes me sad.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.909
You look really pretty, by the way.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.411
You’re having sex.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.496
Yes. That is true.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
Just... not as good as with Anders?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.210
Well, you know...

08:23.420 --> 08:27.382
Why do we do this every year?
Our fucking kids don’t even come.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.259
Kat’s not even coming for Christmas.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.886
Are you kid... That’s awful.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.679
Why didn’t Preston come?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.307
You know, Preston had other plans.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.101
Whatever that means.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.312
- Oh God, I hate these fucking Spanx.
- Mmm.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.075
Hello.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.661
Shh...

09:00.957 --> 09:02.542
- Hey.
- Yo. What’s up?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.754
- What are you guys smoking?
- What?

09:05.837 --> 09:08.465
You don’t have to worry.
I’m not gonna tell anyone.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.108
You’re gonna be doing it anyway, right?

09:10.175 --> 09:14.054
If you’re one of my dad’s friends that he
sent out here to narc on us or whatever,

09:14.137 --> 09:17.515
you can go back in and tell him
that he’s very sad and predictable.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.933
Okay, Charlie.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.517
Who is that?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.730
- Anders.
- Oh, Christ...

09:23.813 --> 09:25.523
And I’m not one of your dad’s friends.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.942
Wait, dude, come back for a sec.
Come here.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.383
What do you mean you’re not friends?

09:31.821 --> 09:35.742
Well, I’m not.
I mean my wife is. Well, my ex-wife.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.829
Personally, I can’t, uh...
I can't stand your parents.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.207
I find them unbearable.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.252
Really? After all those summers
and shitty dinners

09:46.419 --> 09:47.754
and blah blah blah?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.422
I walked away from all that.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.757
So I’ve heard.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.176
So, why are you here?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.513
That’s a really fucking good question.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.931
You know how to rip one of these?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.266
I don’t even know what that is.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.435
This... is resourceful.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.855
Come on.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.276
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sure, why not? Fuck it.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.571
There you go.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.490
Thank you.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.368
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.501
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Damn.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.805
Yeah, the smell of your dad’s cigar...

10:41.683 --> 10:43.518
makes me wish I was born without a face.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.689
How you feeling?

10:50.942 --> 10:53.486
Oh, wow. Oh, yeah...

10:55.905 --> 10:58.032
Oh. I feel joyful.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.910
Oh. So joy... Wow.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.586
And sad, too... Jesus.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.172
This is some serious grass.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.799
Nah. That’s the PCP.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.593
Yeah.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.054
What, are you joking? I just smoked PCP?

11:20.138 --> 11:21.848
We don’t technically know what it is.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.683
- It’s like more of a blend.
- Yeah!

11:23.766 --> 11:26.936
We feel joyful.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.354
So joyful.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.273
- And sad.
- Very sad.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.864
I should get back to the party.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.491
All right. Knock yourself out. Have fun.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.410
Be careful, man.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.669
Oh. What’re you doing out here, buddy?

11:51.753 --> 11:54.130
Oh, just getting some air.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.094
You’ve had a big year, huh?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.557
- Surprised to see you here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.977
- I'm still looking for my son.
- Yeah.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.397
Disappeared earlier,
which is cause for worry.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.083
He was supposed to be
in his room studying,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.402
as he failed three
of his exams at his boarding school.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.490
I’m so fucking sick of warning him.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.950
Who am I talking to?

12:22.033 --> 12:23.660
- You know better than anyone.
- Yeah.

12:23.743 --> 12:28.039
No, seriously, with Preston,
you guys, you did a program, right?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.289
Huh?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.175
You drag him off into the woods
or something?

12:31.209 --> 12:32.961
Or something. Yeah.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.421
Excuse me.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.352
- I don’t get it.
- Look who it is.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.782
- I don’t get it.
- Okay. Let’s come over here for a minute.

13:00.029 --> 13:04.367
So... are you seeing that guy now?

13:05.243 --> 13:06.577
Yeah. For a few months, yeah.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.622
And is he gonna live here now?

13:09.706 --> 13:11.958
Uh, well, he’s looking for a place.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.169
He’s, uh, trying to get out of the city.
He’s going to commute for a while.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.464
And what... you guys have been sleeping
together for a couple of years now?

13:18.548 --> 13:19.424
Please don’t.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.968
What, have we been divorced
for, like, six months?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.512
Honey, why are you at this party?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.764
I was invited.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.058
Everyone’s invited.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.364
- Do you think this is funny?
- No, I don’t...

13:46.325 --> 13:47.618
That is funny.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.413
What is wrong with you, Anders?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.999
You are the one
who said you needed space.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.753
Well, it’s not my job anymore.
I don’t have to babysit you.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.922
I don’t have to make sure
that you don’t embarrass yourself.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.885
You are the one who wanted out.
So, for God fucking sake, get out.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.048
We need an ambulance!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.764
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- Oh, my God!

14:12.351 --> 14:13.511
<i>Fucking angel dust?</i>

14:14.270 --> 14:16.790
I heard they got him hooked up
to a bunch of tubes and machines.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.234
Mom said Sophie is a complete wreck.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.402
I’m sure she is.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.072
Apparently, the Ashfords are suing now.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.159
Who in God’s name are they gonna sue?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.371
Uh, the school, I guess. I mean,
they think that’s where he got the drugs.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.330
Wait, wait.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.500
They move their kid
to a different school because of drug use,

14:35.583 --> 14:38.294
and now they’re blaming
his current drug use

14:38.378 --> 14:40.421
on the school that they shipped him to?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.549
Don’t act like you don’t understand it.
You guys did the same thing to me.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.926
I didn’t sue anybody.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.429
And you went to rehab.
Not boarding school.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.516
- Well, I feel bad for the kid.
- So do I.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.810
Hey, I heard you saw Mom.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.230
- And met her new boyfriend?
- Yeah. I already knew him.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.732
- You did?
- Mm-hmm. Not well.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.442
We came up together as traders.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.615
Just tell me he’s not living at the house.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.367
Well, it’s Mom’s house. So...

15:12.078 --> 15:13.496
He’s living at the house?

15:15.206 --> 15:16.526
Dad, it’s not your house anymore.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.377
- Well, it's certainly not theirs.
- What does that mean?

15:20.711 --> 15:21.712
Isn’t it Mom’s?

15:21.963 --> 15:25.133
Well, it was going to be. Yeah...

15:25.216 --> 15:31.139
but in a fit of generosity and stupidity,
I told her she could have it.

15:31.722 --> 15:38.062
But I can’t afford to retire
and pay for the mortgage.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.231
Jesus.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.610
- Don’t tell your mother, okay?
- You know, Mom’s gonna freak.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.696
Where the fuck am I gonna live?

15:46.779 --> 15:50.241
You living there is meant to be temporary.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.911
She should downsize anyway.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.998
- Hell, let Donny pay for it.
- Well...

15:57.415 --> 15:59.333
I guess he probably can.
He seems pretty loaded.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.128
Well...

16:06.299 --> 16:09.219
I don’t know, Dad. I mean, it looks like
a bunch of little kids live here.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.639
Eh. Look at it. It’s nice. It’s festive.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.226
It’s like your own sad
little Christmas parade.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.564
All right. Gotta go.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.034
Wow, do you think this is a bit much?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.915
Thanks so much. Of course, I will.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.791
Oh, you know it.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.003
He’s going as soon as he’s out.
We’ve found a good place.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.215
Yes. I will. Thanks again.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.176
Oh, honey, you’re so nice.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.552
I'm not really that nice.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.630
I just couldn’t imagine
who I’d run into at the market.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.933
Well, you would have run
into Aunt Marilyn Erickson...

16:57.016 --> 16:59.227
- Oof.
- ...and Leslie Abrams. Separately.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.062
You’re my savior.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.944
- Thank you.
- Yes, you’re welcome.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.714
How long do you think
Preston’s gonna stay with you?

17:11.739 --> 17:14.407
Jesus. There’s a part of me,
the sick part,

17:14.617 --> 17:16.077
kinda likes having him around.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.304
Every once in a while I forget

17:17.328 --> 17:19.579
and I go to, like,
move something out of his face,

17:19.664 --> 17:23.376
and he... One of these things.
It’s like, "Oh. Oh, right, you’re a man."

17:24.961 --> 17:26.087
What did we do wrong?

17:26.671 --> 17:28.047
Maybe I babied him too much.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.905
Perhaps we’ve done everything wrong.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.018
When are we gonna know
if our kids are broken?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.974
Gee, let’s see. What time is it?

17:38.099 --> 17:40.768
Tell me about your week. The holidays.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.771
Uh... I got the condo decorated.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.065
Uh... Preston helped.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.860
- That must have been nice.
- And I, uh, went to a party.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.280
I don’t know why I went.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.659
Yeah, I do. I went to see Helene. Uh...

17:56.909 --> 17:58.494
Was an awful night. I, uh...

17:59.203 --> 18:02.081
I ended up getting very loaded.
It did not go well.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.500
- You got loaded?
- Yeah. I did a stupid thing.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.379
I got high with a bunch of kids
and then one of them ended up in the ER.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.757
- You got high with the kids?
- Stupid.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.594
At this point, Anders,
I should tell you. I was...

18:15.428 --> 18:17.054
I was at the Ashford’s party.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.390
Hmm?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.392
I'm... I don't... I'm not... Sorry.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.894
Kathleen and Sophie Ashford
are quite close.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.273
Oh, well, I didn’t see you there.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.443
So, uh...

18:31.777 --> 18:35.781
So, okay, so you know what happened
to Charlie.

18:35.865 --> 18:40.077
And, um... Uh, Jesus...

18:40.786 --> 18:43.372
Way to bury the lead, Howard. Okay.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.710
Uh... Well, I’m sure that you know...

18:48.210 --> 18:51.130
I’m sure Charlie’s gonna be all right.
I mean...

18:51.213 --> 18:55.092
Kids smoke dope,
and it’s not a big deal.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.762
Do you know what drugs he was doing?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.097
It was some kind of high school...

19:00.598 --> 19:04.101
boarding school,
kind of hybrid blend kind of thing.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.687
- Maybe PCP.
- PCP?

19:07.938 --> 19:11.108
Look, he hands me this thing,
crazy little device,

19:11.192 --> 19:15.154
I thought it was grass,
and yeah, it was stupid, but I mean...

19:15.363 --> 19:19.408
You know, come on, Howard,
the kid would have been smoking it anyway.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.704
I’m really sorry.

19:24.789 --> 19:28.084
This is urgent. Please excuse me. Hello.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.601
Fuck it.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.516
- Charlie?
- One sec.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.021
- Uh, my parents aren’t here.
- Is my wife here?

20:31.731 --> 20:32.773
I don’t see her.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.029
- Uh, how are you feeling?
- Awesome.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.699
Because you look okay.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.927
The way people were talking,
I thought maybe you were...

20:43.951 --> 20:46.537
Do you have like a balloon for me
or something?

20:46.620 --> 20:50.458
Yeah. In fact,
I thought you might like this.

20:51.292 --> 20:55.463
That’s pretty sweet.
What the fuck is this?

20:59.467 --> 21:00.551
Did you lift this?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.512
- No.
- You brought me a, uh...

21:03.804 --> 21:06.056
an erotic, stolen library book?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.933
Okay, I’ll take it.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.352
Hell no, it’s the best present
of all time. I love it!

21:11.729 --> 21:13.063
Okay. Um...

21:15.316 --> 21:18.652
If you need anything, I’ve moved,
so the number is on the back.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.740
What happened to you?
You quit your fancy job?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.867
Oh... Well, it’s complicated.

21:24.950 --> 21:29.079
But yeah. I couldn’t go on doing
what I was doing to make a living

21:29.163 --> 21:33.793
- and still feel good about myself.
- I can totally respect that.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.003
And it was complicated.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.172
There were a lot
of other things tied into it.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.802
Like my wife and the endless commuting
and just a lot of things.

21:42.885 --> 21:47.139
I couldn’t take it, so, uh...
Yeah... something had to change.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.017
I have to go to rehab now
because my parents are Nazi assholes.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.560
They’re worried about you.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.395
They’re embarrassed. There’s a difference.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.647
Well, you did a stupid thing.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.900
Seriously? I’m getting a lecture from you?
You were high as balls.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.986
I was tricked into that.
And, yeah, I’m sorry.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.323
- "Guys, I’m joyful. I feel joyful."
- Hey, hey, hey...

22:04.406 --> 22:07.409
I need you to, uh...
I need you to keep that between us.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.954
Don’t worry, I’m not gonna tell anyone.
It’s not my style.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.332
Hey, is that, uh... is that Laika?
Your drawing?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.042
It is. Do you know what the, uh,

22:15.125 --> 22:18.087
the scientist in charge of that project
said 40 years later? He said...

22:18.712 --> 22:20.965
"Nothing that we learned on that mission

22:21.048 --> 22:23.509
could possibly justify the loss
of that beautiful animal."

22:23.926 --> 22:26.595
She was a stray. He was the one
that found her in the first place.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.199
That’s heartbreaking.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.034
I know there’s already
a million books about her.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.418
Mine’s gonna have a different end.

22:32.643 --> 22:33.727
- Oh, yeah?
- So they said

22:34.019 --> 22:36.039
that she crashed into the ocean and died,
but she didn’t.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.773
She just burned alive in the atmosphere.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.150
So, in my version,
she’s supposed to still be out there.

22:40.234 --> 22:44.029
So Oleg, that’s the scientist guy,
is, like, old and poor,

22:44.321 --> 22:46.049
and one day he turns on some
of the old equipment,

22:46.073 --> 22:48.325
and he hears her heartbeat,
like she’s still out there.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.953
- What happens then?
- That’s as far as I’ve gotten.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.250
- Anders.
- He just brought me a book. That's it.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.961
Well, that was... sweet.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.630
I really admire him as an artist.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.758
- I really like his graphic novel.
- Yeah. So do I.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.553
- You don’t even know what it is.
- It’s about a dog.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.598
A stray dog, launched into space
for reasons she can never understand.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.849
It’s about being exploited

23:11.932 --> 23:14.226
by the people who are supposed
to be protecting you.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.103
The Meadows isn’t outer space, honey.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.855
It’s worse. It’s Arizona.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.207
You see what I have to deal with?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.191
I’m sorry, he needs to rest.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.486
- He’s here looking for his wife.
- Uh, no. Not, not true.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.738
I think she’s at home.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.197
With her new boyfriend?

23:27.281 --> 23:29.241
A lot of conversations
between my mom and your ex.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.410
You know, about whether things
are moving too fast.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.537
- A lot of yackety-yack.
- You made your point.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.753
- Feel better.
- Mm-hmm.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.602
<i>I know you’re not gonna pick up.
But I want some photo albums.</i>

23:56.894 --> 24:01.523
And I want, uh, some home movies,
because I have none here.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.026
Just a couple. Okay?

24:05.152 --> 24:09.531
I was full of bravado. I said,
"Yeah, sure. You want the house, keep it.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.616
Is that all you want?"

24:10.699 --> 24:12.660
I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.997
You were thinking...
you were done with the marriage,

24:17.081 --> 24:18.624
so you were done with the house.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.958
I get that.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.879
So, I haven’t paid the mortgage
in six months.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.132
- So, what do you need?
- I’m gonna pay you back.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.010
- Every penny.
- I am not worried.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.346
You know...

24:33.138 --> 24:36.392
I used to have this vision of my life.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.768
It was like a web.

24:37.935 --> 24:42.106
And these threads
that connected me, you know.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.065
Yeah.

24:43.148 --> 24:46.485
And the more webs
you could have coming from you,

24:46.568 --> 24:48.570
then the more important you were. Right?

24:48.654 --> 24:51.156
Like, if you were a doctor
you’d cure a bunch of...

24:51.240 --> 24:52.116
- Patients.
- ...patients.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.034
And... or a teacher.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.245
You got a million threads, you know.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.665
And you would be, basically,
irreplaceable, right?

24:59.748 --> 25:02.292
'Cause so many people
depended on you, right?

25:02.376 --> 25:04.296
- You understand what I’m saying?
- Yeah, it's...

25:05.254 --> 25:07.631
- webs and...
- Yeah, but it’s really not the case.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.216
- Come on, man.
- No, it’s the web.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.928
The web is remaking itself.

25:13.554 --> 25:17.725
Revising itself every second of every day.
And so if you vanish,

25:17.808 --> 25:22.896
then the people that were in your life,
they learn to rely on someone else,

25:23.063 --> 25:24.982
you know, and you’re gone.

25:25.065 --> 25:29.945
And then the web just remakes itself
and moves on without you.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.614
- But you got out of the web.
- No, no, no.

25:32.698 --> 25:38.746
No. This whole town, it’s a life of work,
and commuting and bullshit.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.539
- Yeah.
- You know what I’m saying?

25:40.622 --> 25:43.917
And that was one web
I was happy to get out of.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.128
Just drink up.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.384
Come on. Come on, man.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.970
I think you need to see something.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.997
How’s Preston? He’s still at Northwestern?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.625
Graduated. Living with Helene.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.544
Oh, Jesus. What was the point?

26:39.556 --> 26:40.556
Miss that?

26:47.606 --> 26:51.735
I’m taking this Asian fusion
cooking class.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.028
Total blast.

26:53.111 --> 26:57.115
I never would have thought
cooking is so relaxing.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.409
You know, I just put on some music,

26:59.576 --> 27:01.870
sip some wine, a few hours go by,

27:02.120 --> 27:03.997
end up with a delicious meal.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.336
I generally eat it alone,
but it’s delicious. Delicious!

27:09.419 --> 27:12.422
Larry, it's... Don’t you think
it’s a little tragic?

27:12.589 --> 27:15.676
Fuck you, man.
Only if you look at it that way.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.846
- It’s how you see it. It's how you see it.
- Hi, guys.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.722
- How about a dance?
- No, thank you.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.725
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, no offense.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.809
Come on.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.437
- He’s newly divorced, so...
- Oh!

27:27.521 --> 27:31.108
- Then you need a little extra TLC.
- You’re probably right, but uh...

27:33.569 --> 27:37.823
- I’ll take the dance.
- Okay. You got it.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.288
You okay, dude?

27:46.123 --> 27:49.793
Hey, could you, uh,
wet a paper towel for me, please?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.380
Am I in the men’s room?

28:05.601 --> 28:06.727
Thank you.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.359
You okay?

28:15.444 --> 28:17.946
I haven’t thrown up in a club
since I was 22.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.436
- I wouldn’t drink that if I were you.
- It's disgusting.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.367
Oh. Yeah. Right.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.746
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

28:25.913 --> 28:26.913
No, why are you here?

28:28.916 --> 28:32.502
I was stupid enough
to come here on a date.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.715
Oh, my God...

28:37.132 --> 28:40.093
Yeah, I’m hip. I can go to a strip club.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.722
Three vodkas in, he’s trying to buy me
a fucking lap dance.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.725
Is it hip for a woman
to go to a strip club?

28:47.434 --> 28:48.434
I don’t know.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.899
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I didn’t want to come here, either.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.402
Yeah, right.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.245
Hey, man,
I think your friend went upstairs.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.122
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.271
Okay?

29:32.896 --> 29:33.896
Thank you.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.367
42 Maple Street, please.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.829
And 112 Fisherman’s Lane.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.164
I don’t have enough money.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.458
Don’t worry about it. I got it.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.626
Thank you.

30:02.843 --> 30:03.843
Beautiful house.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.389
Why are we here?

30:07.556 --> 30:10.600
112 Fisherman’s Lane.
That’s what you said.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.649
Well...

30:21.111 --> 30:23.655
- Uh... Here. Take care.
- Oh. Thank you.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.901
What the hell is all this shit?

31:13.955 --> 31:17.417
Who the fuck is in my house?
Jesus Christ, Anders!

31:17.918 --> 31:20.478
- I almost took your fucking head off.
- What are you doing here?

31:20.504 --> 31:23.882
You know what? I’m just getting some
things of mine. Everyone needs to relax.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.342
This is a weird flavor.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.553
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope. Tastes like... flowers.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.757
You can’t just come in here!

31:29.805 --> 31:31.890
I’m getting some things
that are rightfully mine.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.101
- No, you’re drunk.
- Some of this stuff...

31:34.643 --> 31:36.645
I have a right to have it in my house.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.482
I left a whole box of stuff for you,
over here by the door.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.402
- Then what’s all this?
- I gave you half!

31:47.739 --> 31:50.534
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.220
You care so much about family pictures,

31:52.244 --> 31:54.329
you need to break in here
in the middle of the night.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.918
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, I am a little dizzy.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.379
- Why don’t you take a seat?
- Don’t tell me what to do.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.589
I’m gonna sit down anyway.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.636
Why don’t you give me those keys?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.680
Donny, don’t do this now.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.515
We can’t have this happen again. Come on.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.600
You’re not going to do this again,
right, Dad?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.438
You know what?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.606
You never know.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.653
Preston, can you drive
your father home, please?

32:27.779 --> 32:28.822
You got it.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.248
So, she hired you.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.917
'Cause I thought it was all volunteers.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.129
Yeah, most of them are,
but she worked it out so I could get paid.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.714
Takes a lot of patience.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.883
- You like it?
- Yeah. The pay is shit, but...

32:47.966 --> 32:49.843
But you’re saving for your own place?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.139
It’s not that bad. I gotta go.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.515
- Where?
- Work.

32:55.891 --> 32:56.891
Oh.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.979
Hey, Preston. Come back here.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.440
What does she see in him?

33:06.359 --> 33:07.694
I don’t know. I mean...

33:08.403 --> 33:10.697
- They seem kind of happy.
- Bullshit.

33:11.448 --> 33:12.741
You know, you left her.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.993
Right? You remember that?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.411
You’re mad at me about that.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.040
No, I’m totally thrilled you just kicked
Mom to the curb after all this time.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.918
I’m gonna apologize to her
about last night, but...

33:26.171 --> 33:27.172
I worry about you.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.258
- You’re worried about me?
- Yeah. I can be an idiot

33:30.342 --> 33:33.512
and I can still worry about you.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.807
Okay, now, Christmas Eve,
why don’t you come over?

33:37.891 --> 33:41.811
We’ll hang out. You can stay over,
we’ll watch some videos, or...

33:42.479 --> 33:46.483
Mom’s planning the usual dinner.
Like she does every year, so I’m sorry.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.152
But she’s already
making a big deal out of it.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.946
Yeah, don’t worry about it. It’s nothing.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.032
Okay, go teach someone how to read.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.951
- All right, I will.
- Cool.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.913
So, uh, Mr. Baptiste,

33:59.996 --> 34:03.875
I understand there has been a dispute
with your tutor.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.210
It’s not a dispute.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.878
If you would explain everything to me.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.380
- He stole from me.
- He stole from you? How?

34:09.464 --> 34:12.217
Your son told me about an opportunity
to make money.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.553
An opportunity?
What kind of an opportunity?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.304
Some gambling business.

34:16.596 --> 34:19.599
How he’s going to double my money.
Where’s my money?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.058
I don’t see it.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.393
I need this money.

34:28.817 --> 34:32.487
Hey, I’m, uh...
I'm Anders. I’m your neighbor.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.154
Hello.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.281
Hello.

34:38.201 --> 34:42.414
Oh, look... Look, hold on. Hold on.
No, no, no, you’re missing the best part.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.670
Come in.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.130
Hey.

34:50.797 --> 34:51.797
Okay...

34:53.091 --> 34:57.470
I was drunk. Uh, it was a stupid,
obviously ridiculous thing to do.

34:57.554 --> 34:58.847
- I’m sorry.
- Terrific, Anders.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.267
At the moment,
I need to find our moron of a son

35:02.684 --> 35:05.937
who fucked up the only job he could get
because his mother gave it to him.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.731
Where is he?

35:08.064 --> 35:09.566
I have an idea.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.569
How could he do this to me? To himself?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.196
Hold on, do what?

35:15.280 --> 35:18.366
He took money from a client
and gambled with it.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.923
Hi. Is there a, uh, poker game
going on here somewhere?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.259
- Excuse me.
- I’m not causing trouble.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.304
I’m just, uh, looking for my son.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.182
Through the kitchen.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.035
This is very impressive.
Did you guys have me followed?

36:02.911 --> 36:04.371
Wow, Preston. Really?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.750
I had a very
interesting conversation today.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.335
I didn’t take that guy's money.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.254
$2,000 from an illiterate man.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.840
I thought we weren’t supposed
to use that word.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.092
Don’t be an asshole, Preston.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.135
Look, I’m going to win it back. Okay?

36:21.596 --> 36:23.890
Look at you two, a real team.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.620
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Yeah, he gave me the money.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.479
- For you to gamble with?
- The guy...

36:30.230 --> 36:31.870
he had a broken truck and he was thinking

36:31.898 --> 36:35.068
about asking some sketchy dude
in the neighborhood for a loan, okay?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.462
I told him how these things work,

36:36.486 --> 36:38.905
how he’d get himself curb-stomped
if he’s not careful.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.032
So he asked if I knew of anything else...

36:41.241 --> 36:42.909
And you thought, "Oh, that’s right,

36:42.992 --> 36:45.352
there’s that underground poker game
that I’m involved with."

36:45.412 --> 36:47.205
Okay. Let’s just get this over with.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.375
- Get what over with?
- The firing. The sacking. Come on.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.627
- I get it.
- You have to understand, Preston,

36:52.711 --> 36:56.673
even if you meant well, it’s gonna look
really bad if I don’t fire you.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.217
You don’t have to explain it.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.759
You’re fired.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.222
- And you have a week to move out.
- All right.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.767
Oh, uh, but you should probably
look for a place to live, too.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.161
Me? What is that supposed to mean?

37:09.185 --> 37:11.020
Well, 'cause
Dad’s not paying the mortgage.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.398
- He hasn’t in six months.
- So...

37:13.857 --> 37:16.317
You’re still fired.
And you’re still moving out.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.785
- Look...
- Just tell me that that’s not true.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.370
I’m getting it sorted...

37:27.454 --> 37:31.166
You had to be a big man, right?
"Go ahead. Keep the house."

37:31.499 --> 37:34.252
I was attempting to be... generous.

37:34.335 --> 37:38.131
The only problem, Anders, is to be
a big man, you have to be a big man.

37:38.214 --> 37:42.594
I made so much money for everybody!
Everybody! For years!

37:42.677 --> 37:44.888
So I could lose the house. To foreclosure.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.391
Why do you even want it?
It's a five-bedroom house.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.310
Look, I may decide to move.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.606
But if I decide to move,
I prefer that it’s my choice.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.108
Well, you don’t have to worry
'cause I’m getting the money.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.485
Really? And how?

37:58.568 --> 38:00.612
A loan. From Larry Eichner.

38:01.237 --> 38:04.824
That house is our history.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.828
It’s my history.
I made that garden from nothing.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.872
- And that means something.
- I know.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.415
I know it means something.

38:12.499 --> 38:15.835
But do you really?
Do you know what anything means?

38:18.213 --> 38:19.255
I thought I did.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.720
You’re supposed to be happy now, Anders.
That’s why we got divorced, right?

38:25.804 --> 38:29.224
'Cause we were all in the way
of your happiness.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.811
The house, your career, me.
The way of life.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.896
- You remember all that?
- Yeah.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.514
- I’m the lady who...
- I recognize you.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.516
- We shared a cab.
- Feeling better?

39:11.599 --> 39:12.684
Yeah, thank you.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.853
Listen, that cab was a fortune.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.288
- Let me pay you back.
- Oh, God, no.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.730
- Oh, no, I insist.
- No, come on.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.608
Can I buy you lunch or something?

39:21.651 --> 39:23.319
Okay, don’t worry about it. I just...

39:23.403 --> 39:25.363
I just wanted you to know
I appreciated it.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.283
You really saved me. And I thank you.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.493
You know what? Yeah.

39:31.452 --> 39:35.206
Yeah, buy me lunch.
A very, very expensive lunch.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.374
Okay.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.668
Would you please put your number in there?

39:43.047 --> 39:45.717
All I ask. Please don’t fucking text me.

39:47.969 --> 39:52.015
I’ll text you soon. Yeah?

40:06.279 --> 40:08.072
- Hey.
- Okay...

40:08.156 --> 40:11.284
- Is this a bad time?
- Uh, no. Were you waiting for me?

40:11.910 --> 40:15.079
- No. Just drove up.
- Okay. I just got home. Uh...

40:15.163 --> 40:16.414
- Yeah, come in.
- Great.

40:17.498 --> 40:18.498
Wow!

40:19.792 --> 40:20.710
This is a nice place.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.504
Oh. Thank you. Well, it’s not,
not as nice as yours, but...

40:27.342 --> 40:28.968
Uh, how about a beer?

40:29.594 --> 40:30.970
No. Definitely not.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.058
Listen. I’d like to apologize.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.518
- You?
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.730
For everything that’s happened. I should
have called you in the first place.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.649
I mean, we were friends.

40:42.732 --> 40:43.732
Well...

40:44.150 --> 40:44.984
Yeah...

40:45.068 --> 40:46.361
Well, we were acquaintances.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.070
And it’s awkward.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.365
- Hmm.
- So...

40:51.908 --> 40:54.118
I want to be completely up front with you.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.120
Full disclosure.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.538
The older I’ve gotten,

40:57.830 --> 41:00.750
the more I’ve realized
that it’s all about communication.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.002
What’s all about communication?

41:03.836 --> 41:05.588
Relationships. People.

41:07.674 --> 41:08.758
Yeah.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.971
- I was an idiot the other night.
- And I am sorry about the golf club.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.518
You know, you hear somebody
in your house at that hour, well...

41:18.935 --> 41:20.061
How is my house?

41:22.313 --> 41:23.982
This is what I want to talk to you about.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.569
I can give you ten percent
over market value.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.364
Excuse me.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.824
I’m making you an offer.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.827
Well, the house isn’t for sale.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.247
It means a great deal to Helene.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.125
I can pay you today, right now.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.336
Yeah. Not interested.

41:47.714 --> 41:51.134
For a guy who worked at finance
for so long, I’m a little surprised.

41:54.470 --> 41:57.140
Look, you’ve got to admit,

41:57.390 --> 41:59.809
this situation doesn’t make sense
to anyone now.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.522
How old are you?

42:04.814 --> 42:05.814
Same as you, why?

42:07.400 --> 42:11.154
Hmm. It just seems to me
to be a strange time

42:11.237 --> 42:14.699
to suddenly decide
you’re gonna have a family.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.702
Anders, this crap has to stop.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.246
What’s with that? The ribbon.

42:21.748 --> 42:25.251
My sister. It’s in honor of her.
She died from breast cancer.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.378
Oh, I’m sorry.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.423
Hey... Um...

42:31.591 --> 42:33.092
I’d like to make a donation.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.596
- Anders, come on. Please.
- "Please" what? I’d like to donate.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.557
Are you going to make me beg?

42:40.433 --> 42:41.433
Take it.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.358
Bye.

43:00.870 --> 43:01.870
Right on time.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.457
- The parking out there. It's just...
- Oh, I know.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.958
It’s Christmas shoppers.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.644
- Yeah, right.
- Can I get you anything?

43:07.668 --> 43:10.421
- I’ll have a Merlot.
- I’ll have a Corona.

43:10.797 --> 43:11.923
Thank you.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.093
Do you have kids?

43:15.176 --> 43:18.137
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I have a boy.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.640
A man, I mean. Uh... You?

43:21.182 --> 43:24.519
I have women. Two women. Here they are.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.604
There’s Rachel and there’s Carmen.

43:26.687 --> 43:27.814
Oh.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.650
And now this is gonna
probably end in one minute,

43:30.733 --> 43:34.195
because I just showed you pictures
of my kids.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.320
They seem nice.

43:35.363 --> 43:38.783
I actually always wanted a son
because boys are so much easier.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.828
I don’t know.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.790
- Easier than girls?
- Girls are... oh!

43:45.873 --> 43:49.001
The mind-games and the lying,
and when they’re teenagers...

43:49.085 --> 43:51.420
The drinking. And they were so mean to me.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.297
- All the time.
- And now?

43:53.464 --> 43:56.050
And now… they’re much more human.

43:56.259 --> 43:59.095
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, sorry.

43:59.178 --> 44:03.391
He’s just kind of lost. You know.
And angry. And generally rude. Immature.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.477
A little bit like the guy you see
sitting across from you right now.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.230
Oh. Lucky me.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.693
- He’s also very sweet and, uh...
- Here you are.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.528
He’s a good person.

44:16.112 --> 44:17.822
- Like you?
- Well, the jury’s out.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.992
- But I try.
- Well, that’s all you can do.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.743
- Right?
- Hear hear.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.458
Can you believe how this town is changing?

44:29.625 --> 44:33.296
- Yeah. I don’t even recognize it.
- Have you seen the three-story Gap?

44:33.379 --> 44:36.382
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I haven’t been in there.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.527
- I really like it.
- You think I should check it out?

44:38.551 --> 44:41.262
I mean, I know they tore down
that gorgeous old bank,

44:41.345 --> 44:45.057
but I have more use
for a three-story Gap.

44:46.767 --> 44:51.063
Um... So are you divorced or separated?

44:51.147 --> 44:53.524
- No. Divorced.
- Good.

45:05.328 --> 45:06.954
What... you smoke now?

45:07.038 --> 45:08.831
Yet another thing
you can dislike about me.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.292
Don’t leave it there! Jesus.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.591
So, I've been Christmas shopping.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.107
You don’t have anything to eat.

45:21.928 --> 45:23.054
I bought you a present.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.264
Since when do you Christmas shop?

45:25.723 --> 45:29.310
I even bought your mother
and her new boyfriend a present.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.811
- Why?
- I don’t know.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.495
I’m just trying to cut the shit I guess.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.231
He throws his money around.

45:34.523 --> 45:37.944
- Acts so earnest.
- Well, I think he is earnest.

45:38.653 --> 45:41.072
Well, it’s a five-bedroom house,
and I can’t live there.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.116
No. You can’t live there
because you’re 27 years old,

45:44.200 --> 45:46.077
and it’s time you moved out on your own.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.580
So much for a nice Christmas.

45:49.664 --> 45:51.540
Hey, have you even looked for a job yet?

45:51.624 --> 45:53.793
- Yeah. I got one.
- Oh, you did?

45:54.043 --> 45:58.798
Oh, yeah, I did! And it's, uh,
I’m delivering booze for Gil’s Liquor.

45:58.881 --> 46:03.261
You know what, Pres? It’s a start.
And the tips will be good, and...

46:04.720 --> 46:06.889
Are you staying with friends or...

46:07.390 --> 46:08.766
- what?
- Or what.

46:09.725 --> 46:10.726
Where are you staying?

46:11.560 --> 46:12.979
That’s not for you to worry about.

46:16.399 --> 46:20.569
Okay, well, then you should, uh,
probably take this now.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.029
Happy Christmas.

46:24.490 --> 46:26.033
Oh, shit. Don’t look at the tag.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.785
Dad, big spender.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.079
I thought you needed something warm.
Do you like it?

46:30.329 --> 46:32.456
I could really use the cash instead.

46:34.917 --> 46:35.917
I’m just kidding!

46:37.795 --> 46:39.880
Do you think
maybe I could crash here tonight?

46:42.717 --> 46:44.635
No, I don’t think you can crash, Preston.

46:44.719 --> 46:47.596
I think you need to think about
tomorrow night and the night after that.

46:47.680 --> 46:50.516
Look, I want you to be able to stay here.
I really do.

46:50.599 --> 46:55.062
- But, you’re an adult now...
- Can’t I just fucking go to sleep?

46:55.146 --> 46:57.440
No. You have to just fucking grow up!

47:06.365 --> 47:07.365
Hey...

47:23.007 --> 47:24.091
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:25.259 --> 47:26.469
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

47:29.096 --> 47:30.473
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

47:41.484 --> 47:42.484
God.

47:44.070 --> 47:45.196
What’s up?

47:45.279 --> 47:48.279
- Man, it’s two o’clock in the morning.
- Yeah. I had a feeling you’d be up.

47:48.449 --> 47:49.450
Are you all right?

47:49.533 --> 47:51.213
No, I had to make
a quick escape.

47:52.745 --> 47:55.706
You got to return this, too.
That shit’s gonna be expensive.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.589
Do your parents know
where you are?

48:05.091 --> 48:06.526
If you’re gonna call them,
I can get out of here.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.052
Yeah, I’d really rather not.

48:08.844 --> 48:11.013
- Well, I need a favor.
- No, you can’t stay here.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.807
It’s not me who needs to stay.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.813
- This is Relic.
- Why?

48:18.896 --> 48:21.315
He’s basically my best friend
in the entire world,

48:21.398 --> 48:23.567
and I need somebody
to look after him for me.

48:23.651 --> 48:24.651
Here.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.697
He’s a kind old man. Hold him.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.453
See. He likes you.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.027
Why are you giving me your turtle?

48:43.504 --> 48:44.672
I’m not going to rehab.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.008
My parents don’t even feed him.
Complain that he smells. And...

48:48.634 --> 48:51.137
if I’m gone, they’re gonna give him away.
They’re assholes.

48:51.554 --> 48:52.763
Where you going?

48:55.099 --> 48:56.099
Yeah.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.022
I have to call your parents.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.232
- Seriously?
- Yeah...

49:03.315 --> 49:04.733
That’s how you’re gonna play this?

49:04.817 --> 49:07.528
Yeah, I can’t just watch you run away.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.656
- I thought you were cool.
- No, I’m not cool.

49:10.739 --> 49:12.658
All right. I should probably warn you...

49:12.825 --> 49:14.427
you’re not
their favorite person right now.

49:14.451 --> 49:15.828
Oh, wow, really?

49:16.036 --> 49:17.454
Tell me something I don’t know.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.002
- What... they know?
- I swear to God

49:23.085 --> 49:26.046
I did not tell anyone.
I don’t know, I’m sorry.

49:31.552 --> 49:32.553
Wow.

49:35.431 --> 49:38.142
So much for confidentiality, Howard.

49:40.477 --> 49:43.856
- It’s a really small town.
- What must they think of me...

49:44.190 --> 49:45.232
Why do you care?

49:45.816 --> 49:47.109
Don’t you hate my parents?

49:48.569 --> 49:51.590
How can you let somebody you don’t
even like have this much control over you?

49:51.614 --> 49:52.489
I don’t...

49:52.573 --> 49:55.242
You have the balls
to live your life, dude.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.593
That’s what sets you apart
from the rest of these fucking zombies.

49:59.413 --> 50:02.875
You can’t go halfway.
You can’t be you and stay in favor.

50:02.958 --> 50:03.876
I don’t know anyone

50:03.959 --> 50:05.937
who would put all that Christmas shit out
in front of their house

50:05.961 --> 50:07.838
without being
completely ashamed of themselves.

50:08.547 --> 50:10.466
Really? You think they're too much?

50:11.467 --> 50:12.551
It’s fucking disgusting.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.094
Hmm.

50:15.596 --> 50:19.475
It just fucking pisses me off.
Like, my parents hate you because you...

50:20.434 --> 50:21.810
left your wife, or whatever,

50:21.894 --> 50:24.855
but, like, I mean, she’s the one
getting married again so, like...

50:27.024 --> 50:28.664
- Excuse me.
- They’re fucking hypocrites.

50:28.734 --> 50:29.974
Like, why is it their business?

50:30.027 --> 50:32.339
She’s the one who’s doing
a hell of lot better than you are.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.363
No offense.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.241
What are you talking about?

50:35.324 --> 50:36.408
You don’t know?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.996
That they’re getting married?

50:43.207 --> 50:44.959
Whoops, I’m sorry.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.504
My mom talks very loud
on the phone. Fuck.

50:48.921 --> 50:50.089
Are you telling me the truth?

50:50.923 --> 50:52.049
Yep.

50:54.468 --> 50:55.552
Big Island.

50:56.428 --> 50:59.306
Maybe gonna be Maui, there was
a lot of back and forth about it.

51:00.349 --> 51:02.351
Um...

51:07.815 --> 51:08.815
Hmm.

51:09.566 --> 51:11.126
Can I have some of this scotch, please?

51:13.112 --> 51:14.113
Uh...

51:15.155 --> 51:17.032
Actually, you got anything stronger?

51:19.326 --> 51:21.745
- Yeah.
- You wanna go to my club house?

51:22.621 --> 51:25.082
But you’re not leaving
that fucking reptile here.

51:55.779 --> 51:56.780
Just follow me.

52:18.510 --> 52:20.270
I figured it out.
I totally forgot.

52:20.346 --> 52:23.015
- I figured out how to end my book.
- Oh, yeah?

52:23.098 --> 52:25.517
So, Oleg thinks he hears,
like, this heartbeat up in space...

52:25.601 --> 52:26.601
Yeah.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.979
- So, he goes to Moscow, but,
- Mm-hmm.

52:29.229 --> 52:31.732
I mean, there’s obviously
no space program anymore.

52:31.815 --> 52:34.943
And anyway, who cares
about a dog that symbolizes the triumph

52:35.027 --> 52:38.322
of a country that doesn’t exist anymore?
So, he’s basically just laughed at...

52:38.405 --> 52:39.448
What is all that?

52:40.324 --> 52:44.161
Oleg starts building his own rocket out
of, like, whatever he can find.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.662
But it’s a fucking suicide mission.

52:45.746 --> 52:48.099
There’s no way that he’ll be able
to reenter the atmosphere.

52:48.123 --> 52:51.293
So, you have crazy old Oleg
who shoots himself off into space.

52:51.377 --> 52:53.457
And it’s not until he’s out there
that he hears it...

52:54.713 --> 52:55.713
Hears what?

52:56.215 --> 52:58.175
There’s this sound
that everything makes in orbit.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.844
A heartbeat.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.722
- Like a "heartbeat" heartbeat?
- Mm-hmm.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.683
Laika’s dead the whole time.

53:06.767 --> 53:09.770
He wasn’t hearing her heartbeat.
He was just hearing his, I mean,

53:10.020 --> 53:13.857
his conscience or whatever. And...

53:14.858 --> 53:16.235
without even realizing it,

53:16.318 --> 53:19.029
he ends up giving himself
the same exact end.

53:21.407 --> 53:24.535
It’s irony or something or whatever...

53:29.873 --> 53:31.750
I think I want to draw it so you can...

53:32.668 --> 53:35.879
really feel like he felt
closer to her out there.

53:36.255 --> 53:39.633
Or, like, free from guilt or something.

53:41.927 --> 53:42.927
You don’t like it?

53:45.472 --> 53:47.516
I think that’s incredibly sad.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.268
I think it’s pretty good.

54:02.281 --> 54:03.115
Whoa!

54:03.198 --> 54:04.908
Have you heard about
this guy that, uh...

54:05.325 --> 54:08.662
in the news,
who raised the price of that AIDS drug?

54:09.121 --> 54:12.583
He’s literally like this fucking
real-life, like, James Bond villain.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.835
Everyone hates him. Like, it’s crazy.

54:14.918 --> 54:18.464
Instead of going into hiding
or trying to clear his name,

54:18.547 --> 54:21.175
he fucking puts a camera
in front of his face

54:21.258 --> 54:23.927
and live-streams his life, 24/7.

54:24.011 --> 54:27.306
- Just to, like, fucking piss people off...
- Helene’s tits are weird.

54:27.681 --> 54:28.557
What?

54:28.640 --> 54:31.018
They’re weird.
She got new ones. They’re...

54:31.935 --> 54:33.604
- They’re kinda...
- Goddammit.

54:33.770 --> 54:36.732
They’re okay. They’re nice even.
But they’re hard...

54:37.107 --> 54:39.276
- I don’t care.
- I think about 'em.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.404
Sometimes for hours,
I think about her tits.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.490
I can't help... Oh.

54:44.948 --> 54:45.948
Yeah.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.494
Yeah. My mom’s got these...

54:50.579 --> 54:54.333
veiny yoga mom arms
and they make me wanna cry.

55:01.715 --> 55:04.343
I wish my kid
would want to hang out with me.

55:06.178 --> 55:09.640
But he just doesn’t.
He’s got no interest at all.

55:11.892 --> 55:14.728
It’s just like
I’m this great big nuisance, that’s all.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.235
Why does she want to get married so fast?

55:22.653 --> 55:23.695
What’s that about?

55:23.779 --> 55:26.490
You know what my dad
always says? "Irregardless."

55:27.699 --> 55:29.868
The fuck does that mean? That even a word?

55:29.952 --> 55:30.994
Absolutely.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.372
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:33.455 --> 55:34.831
He says it all the time.

55:35.207 --> 55:36.542
"Irregardless."

55:42.965 --> 55:44.049
Yeah...

55:45.634 --> 55:48.887
You know why? Because when he was a kid,

55:49.263 --> 55:52.057
he had this big floppy bear,

55:52.349 --> 55:56.520
it was like a big, saggy, shitty bear.

55:56.979 --> 56:01.066
And he carried it everywhere,
and I mean everywhere.

56:01.149 --> 56:04.611
And he held onto that thing,
he held onto that thing way too long,

56:04.695 --> 56:08.156
way past the time when anyone's supposed
to be hanging on to a bear, you know.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.242
So, we took it off him.

56:10.325 --> 56:13.495
And we hid it,
and we pretended that it was lost.

56:13.579 --> 56:14.496
Because we were...

56:14.580 --> 56:18.292
I don't know, we were worried
about him being teased or...

56:20.419 --> 56:24.840
that he wouldn’t grow up
or some bullshit, I don’t know. I mean...

56:27.843 --> 56:30.012
Oh, God, he was so betrayed...

56:31.805 --> 56:32.973
We betrayed him.

56:33.557 --> 56:37.394
He was devastated. He was heartbroken.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.982
What a stupid fucking thing
to be a parent.

56:44.776 --> 56:46.695
Yeah, but it doesn’t have to be.

56:46.778 --> 56:49.615
I feel like you guys all think...

56:50.365 --> 56:53.493
that you have to,
like, worry all the time.

56:54.411 --> 56:57.247
Like, if you weren’t
constantly worrying, like,

56:57.331 --> 57:00.375
you’re bad parents or something.
What is that?

57:09.760 --> 57:11.845
You know what? I’m gonna take you home.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.306
- What?
- Get your things. We’re gonna go.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.558
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:16.642 --> 57:18.036
Take one of these, take the edge off.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.646
No, no, no, this is bad.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.814
We gotta go. Come on.

57:22.898 --> 57:24.898
- Okay. Fine. Yeah.
- I’m serious. Get your things.

57:24.942 --> 57:26.902
- Let me clean some of this up.
- What’s that for?

57:27.027 --> 57:29.505
It’s stupid.
I thought we might want to shoot it off.

57:29.529 --> 57:31.156
- I’m gonna be in the car.
- Yep.

58:05.524 --> 58:06.524
Charlie.

58:11.196 --> 58:12.196
Charlie.

58:14.700 --> 58:15.826
Are you in there?

58:20.330 --> 58:21.330
Charlie?

58:25.585 --> 58:26.628
Shit!

58:34.636 --> 58:35.929
Charlie!

58:36.638 --> 58:38.098
Charlie.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.949
Northwestern, huh?

58:56.033 --> 58:58.713
I heard you’d gone to college,
but I didn’t know where you ended up.

58:59.286 --> 59:00.286
What are you up to?

59:01.413 --> 59:02.914
Loading boxes, I guess.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.168
Not too many stops.

59:06.626 --> 59:08.170
You might see some familiar faces.

59:08.837 --> 59:10.630
All right. I’ll come back for this.

59:22.225 --> 59:23.226
Oh, God...

59:24.728 --> 59:25.728
Okay.

59:55.342 --> 59:56.760
Surprise! I got your wine.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.512
You’re delivering for Gil?

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.056
Put it down there. Come in.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:02.933
No. I’ve got other deliveries to make.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.018
Don’t be silly. Just put it down.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.188
Okay.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.733
Is he paying you well?

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.403
- I make good tips.
- Cheap bastard.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.537
I suppose you haven’t seen Charlie.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.039
Uh... No. Why?

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:30.377
I thought he was in his room packing
for this rehab in Arizona.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:34.548
Not only wasn’t he packing,
he wasn’t there. And that was yesterday.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.676
He’ll come back.
He’s probably just nervous to go.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.511
I definitely was.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.014
You know,
when I saw you at the window just now,

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.516
I thought you were him.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.438
Tell me something.
Are you living out of your car?

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.584
I only ask because your mother thought
you might be living out of your car,

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.486
and I told her that was preposterous,
but now that I see you,

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.030
it sort of looks like
you are living out of your car.

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.408
Um... Yeah. It’s temporary.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.784
Oh, my God.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.704
Do you park it somewhere?

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.456
Yeah, it’s off of 136. Just by the tracks.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.584
That’s terrible! It’s so cold.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.631
Do kids still hang out down by the tracks
and smoke pot?

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.008
Yeah. I guess.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.552
Charlie used to.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:23.471
Or still does. Who knows?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.475
Well... Jesus.
Do you want a shower? A sandwich?

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.728
- Oh, no. I'm okay...
- Sit down.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.273
I know your mother seems pissed,

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:37.694
but the holidays
are about mothers and children,

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.446
if they are about anything.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.742
Yeah, well, I wouldn’t really know it.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:50.123
Well, she’s insisting
on this Christmas Eve dinner,

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:54.127
and I guarantee that has something to do
with the fact that you are here.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.762
- That’s hot enough.
- Thanks.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.516
He’s fucking with me, isn’t he?

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:11.186
He’s pissed off
that we’re insisting on rehab,

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.230
so he’s throwing a tantrum. That’s it.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.440
Uh, I mean, I don’t know...

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.985
But when you used to pull this crap,
that was it, wasn’t it?

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.404
Sure. For sure...

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:30.413
Hey, buddy. Listen,

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.583
if you’re gonna pull this crap,
we’re gonna give away your smelly turtle.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:37.420
I am sick of cleaning that tank
and feeding that thing.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:40.548
So, you better come home
and deal with what you have to deal with.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.843
It’s not forever,
and you know you need it.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:48.306
So, call me. Or better yet, show up.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.268
That’ll get him to call.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.020
He loves that stupid thing.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.235
When you’re finished eating,
take a shower. You’re filthy.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:01.736
Okay.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.620
Okay. Well, uh, I’ll see you.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:12.998
Your tip’s on the counter.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.250
Oh, you don't have to tip me.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:16.542
Of course I do.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:23.883
Oh, well, thank you... for the shower.
And everything.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:26.844
Hey...

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:31.099
I’m sorry you have
such a disappointing dad.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.644
Okay.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.533
<i>Hi, you’ve reached Helene.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.119
Hey, Mom.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.663
Uh, it’s me.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:38.958
I’m sorry.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:42.836
I’m sorry.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.298
Okay... bye.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.641
This place is lovely. It’s really cozy.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.268
Your place is so nice. That is gorgeous.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:05:01.231
Well, sadly, that’s not my place anymore.
That now belongs to my wife.

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:02.982
- Oh.
- It's okay.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.402
We had many good years there together.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.570
Do you mind if I ask why you split up?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.031
You wanna know what the final straw was?

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:12.826
- Oh, you don’t have to tell me.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.703
No... It’s ridiculous.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:20.667
We fought about this, um...

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:25.964
separate little thing, like an oven.
It kinda keeps food warm.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:29.050
We’d just done the whole house.
New furnace.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.595
Floor finishings. Bunch of plumbing work.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:37.475
And, uh, when it was all done,
and we’d spent all the money,

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.645
then she says... she tells me,
"I just want one more thing.

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:44.858
I just want... there’s a little warming
oven that I would really, really..."

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.777
And I just lost it. I was awful.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:49.821
That’s how it goes.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.283
We used to fight about chewing.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:57.912
- Oh, yeah? How so?
- I don’t know. He chewed.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.747
Ah, that is disgusting!

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.752
You know what?
I have one of those food warmers thingies.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.337
- No, you don’t.
- Yes, I do.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:11.009
- I’ve never used it. She can have it.
- Wow, she’s gonna be delighted.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.187
- I don’t think it’s working.
- No, no.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.230
It’s okay.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:28.025
It’s okay.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.285
Well, I mean, don’t worry about it.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.165
It’s probably because
we don’t actually know each other.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.172
Listen, if I got upset every time
I didn’t have an orgasm...

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.466
Hey, could you please just stop talking?

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:54.469
Thank you.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:25.792
What is it with you women
and these books?

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:28.627
Excuse me.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.090
"Live Your Best Life Today."

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.426
Should I get this? Should I read this?

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.096
Are you in my bed...

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.098
making fun of my book?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.226
You’re mean.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.194
Uh...

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:56.905
I’m sorry.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:07:59.283
You’re right.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.329
You’re right. I am.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.333
I’m very sorry.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.591
Oh. My life is a mess.
And now I can’t fuck.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:18.720
And you deserve your best life today.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.852
I know I do.
That’s why I bought the fucking book.

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:43.036
Dude, I can smell that shit
from the inside.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.453
Oh, sorry.

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.997
Preston Harris.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.125
- Malcom, right? Malcom Tendler?
- Yeah.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.419
Yo. Just stub that out there.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.758
- So how you been, man?
- Do you live here?

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:00.386
As of a couple of months ago, yeah.
Pretty sick, huh?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.888
Yeah.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.098
Yeah. My, uh, wife’s family is into LEDs,

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.035
and I’ve been working
with them for a couple of years.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:06.934
So, you’re married.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.310
Yeah. With a kid on the way.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.313
Holy shit.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:14.274
And I actually bought this fucker myself,
if you can believe that.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.779
- And this is the one you picked.
- Hell yeah, man.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:19.447
So, uh, how’ve you been?

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.492
- You want, like, a beer or something?
- Uh, no, that's all right.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.827
- I gotta get back to work.
- Dude, I’m sorry, man.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:27.287
I heard that you did, like,
some time in rehab.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:28.538
- Oh...
- I actually have

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.625
some nonalcoholic beer if you want some.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:33.544
- You do?
- Yeah. Yes, actually...

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.087
Uh, that’s okay.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.008
- You know... I’m still working.
- Right, right, right.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.301
What are LEDs?

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:43.470
You know, lights.
The green alternative, you know.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.682
And, so... is that fun?

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.184
Would you say LEDs are your passion?

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.189
I mean, it’s all right.
It’s a good living.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.482
Sorry.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:58.653
I just didn’t think
this was your style, you know.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.156
My style? What...

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.660
I mean, what’s your style?
Delivering liquor?

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:07.704
Looks that way.

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:12.291
- All right, Malcom, this was great.
- Yeah. Why don’t we, uh...

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:15.962
You know, I would tip you,
but you’re a colossal dick.

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.558
Fuck! Shit!

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.270
Okay.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.529
Hey, Gil, it's me. Um...

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.698
So, my car just died.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:46.366
I know.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:50.705
Listen, I just have one run.
I can do it first thing in the morning.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:54.292
No, I don't have Triple A.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.002
There’s nothing I can do, man.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:00.464
Fuck!

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.347
Whoo!

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:14.682
Damn.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:15.765
Oh!

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:04.440
Charlie.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:14.718
Dad.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.056
Is this Charlie’s turtle
in your bathtub?

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:46.542
Yeah. Yeah, that’s Charlie’s turtle.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.881
- What?
- He came over,

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.759
and he was on his way to, uh, rehab,

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.386
and he just asked me
to look after it for him.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.681
Why did he give it to you?

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:05.394
I guess he thought I was someone,
you know, he could trust with it.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.983
So, you, you and Charlie Ashford
were, like, friends?

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:13.861
No, no. I just...

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:16.906
You know, I visited him
in the hospital and he, uh...

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:22.912
He... I think he just wanted an adult,
or something, to look after it.

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:51.690
Oh, God.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:49.767
- I cannot believe...
- he didn’t come to the funeral.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.769
You know,
when will I stop being surprised...

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.354
You know he left town?

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.398
- When?
- Like a week ago.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:58.733
Where did he go?

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.196
He drove somewhere. I mean...

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:04.615
I’m not really sure.
But he said he was reachable.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:06.492
That’s so weird.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.411
It’s not that weird.
Everyone kind of hates him right now.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:16.377
So, I assume you’re not gonna
invite him to dinner tonight?

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.920
No. No, why would I do that?

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.547
I mean,
he’s not expecting me to, is he?

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:21.882
He’s not even here, so...

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.720
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Will you pick up some sliced almonds?

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.430
You can use Donny’s car. Do you mind?

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:30.015
No, not at all.

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:31.684
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:13.767
Girls. Hello. What are you doing?

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.981
Can I have some of these?

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.733
Load up. Load up.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.778
And here... take some of these.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.447
And here, try these guys.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:27.905
Hours of fun.

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:30.659
Ladies.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.245
Ladies, put all that back.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.247
- Oh, it’s fine.
- It’s not fine.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.166
They’re kids. They’re just having fun.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:40.210
Those are not for playing with.
Put it back.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:45.591
Okay, I’m, uh, very sorry.
Apparently I’ve handed you, uh, non-toys.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.674
Mnh-mnh.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.278
- Girls...
- I’ll take those back.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.304
- Come on. Let’s go.
- Come on.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.959
Don’t talk to that man.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:56.477
Probably got no kids
of his own. Wanna play father.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:16.538
<i>Oh, no, no, no... we’re coming.
We need it, are you kidding?</i>

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.083
<i>Besides,
I’ve been baking all morning!</i>

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.751
- Baking?
- <i>I made eclairs!</i>

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:22.920
<i>And a chocolate bread pudding.</i>

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.643
You know you didn’t need to do that.
You don’t need to do anything.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:28.509
<i>Oh, the smell! It’s heavenly.</i>

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.718
- <i>See you soon.</i>
- Okay...

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:37.392
Ah!

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:44.900
- What a surprise.
- Hi.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:46.610
You fixed your car?

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.905
No. I drove Donny’s.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:57.204
You remember when we used to,
uh, do the jumping on the bed? You were...

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.331
What are you doing here?

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:04.002
I mean, you’re staying at a hotel
an hour from your condo.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.964
You know, well,
sometimes you need a neutral space.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.385
I hate to tell you, Dad.
This place is not neutral.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:12.511
This is depressing.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.222
Yeah, sometimes you need that, too.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:22.646
That is the deed to the house.

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.481
Which I’m gonna give to your mom.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:27.733
With what money?

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.738
That’s not an unreasonable question, Dad.

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:34.908
No. The house now belongs to Donny O'Neil.

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.118
Huh?

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.537
Yeah, he offered to buy me out.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.664
And you said yes?

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:43.750
Well, do they know?

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.587
Not yet, no.
I was gonna put that in the mail.

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:49.631
Look, come on. You’re up here alone.

01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:51.967
Come back with me.
It’s Christmas Eve.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.344
And you bought all those presents.
Give 'em your presents.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.684
- I can’t go back.
- Yes, you can.

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.105
My friends. Come on in.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.904
You guys know you didn’t
have to come, right? Let alone cook.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.787
We couldn’t stay in bed
one more day.

01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:16.408
- You’re our family.
- Yeah, we wanted to be here.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.327
If at any point you feel like leaving,

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.830
please, do whatever
makes you comfortable. Okay?

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.122
Hey, guys.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.792
Oh, I could use some red.

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:28.170
- Honey. Not with the Xanax.
- I’d like some red.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:29.755
- Okay, me too.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:30.881
Two reds.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.342
- You guys take a seat, okay.
- Okay.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.223
So, we’re gonna do it on the Big Island.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:43.060
They have the most options
in terms of resorts.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.776
Where’s Preston?

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.152
Sorry.

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:54.738
Preston. Where is he?

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.535
Oh, uh... I don't actually know.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.744
It’s not unusual.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.120
I thought he lived here.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:06.667
Oh, yeah. I sent him out
on an errand, uh, hours ago.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.085
Interesting.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:15.717
So, when did, uh, Kat go back to Seattle?

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:17.678
This morning.

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:29.835
Why don’t we go into the dining room?

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:32.609
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:45.289
There you are.

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:46.540
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:48.958
Okay.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.045
Oh, Jesus. Um...

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:55.173
- I don’t think you should be here.
- Why not?

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.776
Sophie and Mitchell are
in the other room,

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.361
and they’re kind of out of their minds
right now.

01:24:58.385 --> 01:24:59.862
- You, too.
- I thought it would be okay.

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:00.886
Don’t worry about it.

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:09.104
I had a feeling you might be
hiding people...

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.857
- They’re actually on their way out.
- Oh, I hope not.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.360
Anders, you’ll stay for a drink, at least?

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:19.239
- I just gotta drop these off.
- Bullshit. It’s Christmas!

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:25.245
Look who I found hiding in the kitchen.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:41.595
Sophie, Mitchell...

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:44.013
Okay...

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.975
I’ve been away. That's, um...

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:50.812
That’s why I missed the funeral.
And I’m so, so sorry.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:53.440
He was an exceptional kid.

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:56.485
And I always thought he was very,
very special.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:57.778
He admired you.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.363
Thank you. I...

01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:01.448
I don’t know why.

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:05.202
I could never figure it out. I mean...

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:07.286
Why you?

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.539
What’s so much more acceptable about you?

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:14.670
And then I realized,
you’re the fucked up one.

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:16.630
You’re the one who threw everything away.

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:23.470
I want to know some things.
I have some questions for you.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:25.639
- Preston.
- I have questions for you.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.809
- Preston did not do anything.
- Nobody said he did.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.104
Irregardless, I would like to know,

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.998
what you were doing out
on those railroad tracks.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.358
And why was it you, of all people,
who found my son?

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:37.526
He was trying to get warm.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.653
Could you let the boy
speak for himself?

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:43.699
No, I was just walking around trying
to get warm, 'cause the...

01:26:43.907 --> 01:26:46.302
The heat in my car wasn’t working
so I was just walking around.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.662
You see that?
I don’t believe that.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:51.748
You’re telling me that you went outside
in the woods to get warm?

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:52.833
I was gonna drink.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.168
I had stolen the champagne
and I was gonna drink it.

01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:56.270
- But I didn't drink it...
- There you go.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:57.421
Now we’re getting somewhere.

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:58.606
Mitchell, that’s enough.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:01.310
Now how would that be enough
if we’re just now getting to the truth?

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.154
You did drugs with my son, didn’t you?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.263
I was with him. Preston wasn’t.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:07.930
Dad, it's...

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.560
He came over to my house that night.
He brought his turtle.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.270
And he, uh...

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.522
wanted me to take care of it.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:16.685
He wouldn’t have done that.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:19.443
He loves that turtle.
Why would he do that?

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:21.945
I assumed because he was running away.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.174
When was he with you?

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:28.326
Earlier. That night. Earlier that night.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.036
And you didn’t call us?

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:33.957
- How could you not call us?
- Oh, my God...

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.711
Um... I was... I was...

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:41.214
I was going to. I...

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.884
He, uh...

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:46.136
I told him that I was gonna take him home

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:50.432
- and that is when he ran off.
- So, he brought you his turtle.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:53.310
- And then he left?
- Yeah.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:27:59.566
No. He... I...

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.448
I went with him, and, um...

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:11.578
- we did a small amount of drugs...
- What?

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.165
Before he ran off.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:17.667
No, you didn’t.

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:21.003
Yeah, I did.

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.381
What? You...

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:25.633
You did?

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:29.563
- Why would you do that?
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.348
The point is that, um...

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:33.475
He...

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:37.813
I’m sure that it was an accident

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:39.856
because he just didn’t want
to go to rehab.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.317
Don’t talk to me about my son.
How dare you?

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.530
The things I could tell you.
The things I know.

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:50.534
Sophie, please don’t do this.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:54.454
Your wife has been sleeping with him
for over two years.

01:28:54.871 --> 01:28:55.871
What?

01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:00.168
Is that true? Is she serious?

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.838
You smug little fuck. You let it happen!

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:06.758
No, Mitchell!

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:08.259
Dad!

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.720
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:39.142
The sunflowers
will take over everything. The...

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:42.103
ivy and then the lilies.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:44.898
It’s hysterical.
Somehow everything survives.

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:48.109
These perennials, they are relentless.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.944
That means they go all year round?

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.530
Uh, yes, they bloom every year.
You don’t have to replant them.

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:56.034
And these hydrangeas...
you usually have to replace,

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:58.620
but, uh,
these have been blooming for decades.

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:02.457
Actually, these were here
when we got here. Yeah.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:04.042
How long did you live here?

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:06.503
Oh. We were here a long time.

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:09.005
Yeah, I raised my son here.

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:13.009
He's, uh... He’s a grown up now. Mostly.

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:15.345
He’ll, uh, be going to graduate school
in the city.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:16.304
Nice.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:19.516
Well, thank you so much for coming over
and explaining all this stuff to me.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:22.209
When I talk to the gardener,
I want to know what I’m saying.

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:24.270
Yes. Okay.

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:28.316
Let’s go inside.
Let's go inside.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.790
No. No, no, no.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:47.085
That one’s volume,
and that one’s the channel.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.088
You know, I like your place.

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.048
It’s small. Yeah.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:54.676
It is small, but it is also...

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:57.095
very nice.

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:01.266
I brought you some things.

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:04.269
They are things I didn’t use.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.397
And you can use them
or not use them. Decorating.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:08.939
Thanks.

01:32:11.818 --> 01:32:13.528
I gotta go. I have a date.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.239
Oh! Well, someone should.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.202
Okay.

01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:26.082
- See ya.
- Bye.

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.279
Wow.

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:42.534
- Mmm! Where’d you learn to do this?
- I, um...

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.954
took some cooking classes with a friend.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:49.374
- How retired of you.
- Thank you very much.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:52.209
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:05.974
Mmm. Delicious.
