01:10.040 --> 01:12.110
How do we know
he's not in Los Angeles?

01:12.600 --> 01:14.079
We were promised,

01:14.160 --> 01:16.469
as you know, the call
would come to us at 4:00.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.835
It's now 10 minutes after 4:00.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.576
We're waiting
here, in Los Angeles, for a phone call

01:27.600 --> 01:29.670
from legendary billionaire,
Howard Hughes,

01:29.760 --> 01:31.079
which could debunk...

01:32.680 --> 01:34.989
We're waiting here,
in Los Angeles, for a phone call

01:35.080 --> 01:36.911
from legendary billionaire,
Howard Hughes,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.719
which could debunk a writer's
claim that he's written

01:39.800 --> 01:41.711
an authorized autobiography
of Hughes,

01:41.800 --> 01:44.439
and that Hughes is in
a permanent state of dementia.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.272
The location of Howard Hughes,

01:46.360 --> 01:48.430
still a complete mystery to us.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.511
And if he's unable to call,

01:50.600 --> 01:52.591
as promised
by the Hughes organization,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.910
and prove that he is of sound mind,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.195
well, the organization's
defense contracts,

01:57.280 --> 01:58.759
its medical foundation,

01:58.840 --> 02:01.991
even its casino licenses
could be in jeopardy.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.216
If he doesn't call as promised,

02:03.240 --> 02:04.576
it's gonna be hard for him
to defend himself

02:04.600 --> 02:06.795
against the charges in Miskin's book.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.757
Yes, wherever he's hiding.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.976
Yes, I'm told now
that we can only wait

02:10.000 --> 02:11.956
for Mr. Hughes' phone call until 4:30.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.496
Very few private citizens

02:13.520 --> 02:14.873
can be said to have developed

02:14.960 --> 02:17.679
such an astounding amount
of influence,

02:17.760 --> 02:19.512
celebrity and achievement.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.194
Always with
an eye out for new talent,

02:22.280 --> 02:23.599
Hughes developed a reputation

02:23.680 --> 02:26.672
for employing dozens
of young, aspiring actresses,

02:26.760 --> 02:28.637
and keeping them under contract

02:28.720 --> 02:30.296
...for years at RKO,

02:30.320 --> 02:31.753
regardless of whether or not

02:31.880 --> 02:32.936
they ever appear
in one of his pictures.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.995
Hello?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.616
Howard Hughes
was once the American ideal.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.136
A moviemaker, an aviator,
an inventor...

02:37.160 --> 02:39.037
Howard?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.336
...and an industrialist,
who, at the age of 18,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.120
inherited a fortune
which gave him a monopoly

02:43.200 --> 02:45.031
on the best device in the world

02:45.120 --> 02:46.240
with which to drill for oil.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.536
This is
a man with relationships

02:47.560 --> 02:50.313
with presidents,
military leaders and people who are...

02:50.440 --> 02:52.795
Howard, you've got 18 minutes
left to place the call.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.136
In 1930, he produced
the most expensive movie ever made.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.256
Well, Miskin's book says

02:56.280 --> 02:58.271
that Howard Hughes
cannot remember anything,

02:58.360 --> 03:00.040
that he's completely
unable to communicate.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.873
Well, despite
his countless plane crashes,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.473
all of which he survived...

03:04.560 --> 03:06.073
Howard, can you hear me?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.536
His design set new speed
records in his own racing aircraft,

03:07.560 --> 03:10.518
and he essentially
became an American hero.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.909
Of course,
he's an American hero.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.479
But it's not as if

03:14.560 --> 03:16.118
he's incapable of making a mistake.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.350
He could be in the middle of making

03:18.440 --> 03:20.078
a big mistake right now.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.310
I think
you're mistaken, Mr. Hughes.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.719
I think you're mistaken.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.816
I don't
make mistakes, Colonel.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.115
Okay,
he doesn't make mistakes.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.216
The Department of Defense
has scheduled your flight...

03:30.240 --> 03:32.336
The Department of Defense
didn't invent this plane, Colonel.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.475
I did. I paid for it,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.560
and I'll land it when
I'm goddamn ready to land it!

03:35.640 --> 03:37.596
You are picking up
the Apple Blossom Queen.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.274
Her name is Marla Mabrey.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.509
Go down there, get her,

03:40.600 --> 03:42.192
and drive her straight to her house.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.056
Remember, any driver
who tries any hanky-panky

03:44.080 --> 03:46.116
with a contract actress is gone.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.474
He's fired.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.314
Thank you.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.154
Miss Mabrey, I'm Frank.
Nice to meet you.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.118
Congratulations on being
the Apple Blossom Queen.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.430
The car's just over there.
I'll get the, uh...

04:01.520 --> 04:03.954
I'm Lucey, Frank. I'm Marla's mother.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.268
Oh.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.557
- Uh...
- This is Marla.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.992
- Hi, I'm Frank.
- Hi.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.029
Uh, this way, please.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.394
Oh...

04:17.680 --> 04:19.351
- Sorry, sorry.
- Okay. All right.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.675
Thank you.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.835
Let me get that for you.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.319
- Thank you.
- Of course.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.511
Marla's so excited
that she's actually

04:35.600 --> 04:37.272
gonna finally meet Howard Hughes.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.112
Will that be happening today?

04:39.200 --> 04:40.456
That's hard for me to say, ma'am.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.674
I'm new on the job.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.314
I just, I got here from
Fresno two weeks ago.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.594
Oh, my goodness.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.358
Two weeks in Los Angeles

04:47.440 --> 04:49.749
and you're working for Howard Hughes?

04:49.840 --> 04:52.070
No harm
having high hopes, ma'am.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.600
And what church do you go to, Frank,

04:53.640 --> 04:54.993
if you don't mind my asking?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.435
Well, it's First Methodist.
It's in Fresno.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.670
Oh. All right, you're a Methodist.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.671
- Right.
- I forgive you.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.320
- Oh. She's kidding.
- We're Baptists.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.879
Blessed savior!

05:10.960 --> 05:13.235
Oh, my goodness! What a view!

05:13.880 --> 05:17.031
This is very, very nice. This is...

05:20.720 --> 05:22.711
Where in the world
is that coming from?

05:22.840 --> 05:25.513
That's the Hollywood Bowl down there.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.238
I think they're rehearsing.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.029
Really?

05:29.960 --> 05:32.269
$400 a week on top of this?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.075
And your father never saw
$400 a week

05:36.160 --> 05:37.798
even as a full professor.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.474
Um, the bags are all upstairs.
The kitchen's stocked.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.471
Uh, I'll be right in the...

05:55.560 --> 05:56.616
Outside in the car, if you need me.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.677
Do you know where the nearest
Baptist church would be?

06:00.280 --> 06:01.918
I'll check on that right away, ma'am.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.274
So it just doesn't seem likely

06:03.360 --> 06:04.736
that we'll meet
Mr. Hughes this afternoon?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.274
We assumed we'd meet him
as soon as we arrived.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.749
And where is the script
for Stella Starlight?

06:10.480 --> 06:11.833
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't...

06:11.920 --> 06:13.320
Any idea when I do the screen test?

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
I'm sorry, I really...

06:16.920 --> 06:17.989
Excuse me, sorry.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.196
Uh, I'll be right outside in the car

06:20.280 --> 06:21.713
until your next driver comes on.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.677
His name is Levar.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.319
Oh, my stars!

06:28.600 --> 06:30.636
Why are these chairs
so far back?

06:31.720 --> 06:33.199
I'm gonna move them up.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.416
President Eisenhower

06:34.440 --> 06:35.760
went on to say that
the government

06:35.800 --> 06:37.119
has what he termed,

06:37.200 --> 06:40.476
"all sorts of useful projects
on the shelf,"

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
to be put into action

06:41.640 --> 06:43.376
against the recession
if and when they're needed.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.136
The economy of this country

06:45.160 --> 06:46.878
is a lot stronger than

06:46.960 --> 06:49.315
the spirit of those people
that I see...

06:49.400 --> 06:50.696
"Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these, Thy gifts

06:50.720 --> 06:52.016
"that we are about to receive
from thy bounty,

06:52.040 --> 06:53.080
"through Christ, Our Lord.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
- "Amen."
- Amen.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.671
Well, from all I've read
about Howard Hughes

06:58.760 --> 07:01.194
I hope he doesn't expect to
meet you in some hotel room.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.388

07:37.400 --> 07:40.915
Yes, I got caviar
but I still haven't met him.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.831
Do you have any idea how many houses

07:42.920 --> 07:44.717
he has for actresses under contract?

07:45.440 --> 07:47.032
I think something like 14.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.432
More like 22.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.112
More like 26.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.473
- Twenty six?
- Twenty six?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.639
This is how we get paid?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.870
Lord in heaven!

08:22.360 --> 08:24.999
Nadine, am I meeting Mr. Hughes today?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.191
Sit.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.198
This is an engineering problem.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.594
You do know what these are?

08:31.680 --> 08:33.635
Are these hulls of an aircraft?

08:33.760 --> 08:34.794
What?

08:34.919 --> 08:37.388
I don't know. Twin pontoons?

08:37.480 --> 08:38.754
We do movies, Howard.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.477
We don't know pontoons, propellers...

08:40.559 --> 08:41.708
Gentlemen,

08:41.799 --> 08:43.535
the way that the dress fits
around the breasts

08:43.559 --> 08:45.596
makes it look like they're padded.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.976
If the brassiere incorporated
some kind of point at the nipple

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
it would solve that.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.593
And try not to let Miss Russell

08:50.680 --> 08:52.352
hear you call them pontoons.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.078
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.230
Both girls are going
away for the weekend,

08:57.320 --> 08:58.912
so go now.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.148
Oh, Frank, there you are.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.639
Listen, you're doing swell,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.320
and I want you to be prepared
to drive the boss any minute.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.556
Well, my mom passed away.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.473
Actually, I was raised
mostly by my grandma.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.319
And your dad?

09:20.800 --> 09:21.835
Uh...

09:21.920 --> 09:25.595
Well, he, kind of, took off
before she passed away, so...

09:25.680 --> 09:27.113
I think every few weeks,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.416
I'll probably be able to go back

09:28.440 --> 09:31.079
and see my grandma and my girl.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.559
I grew up across the street from,

09:32.640 --> 09:33.868
actually, my fiancée.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.713
Right now she takes care
of her father's dog kennel.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.110
Do you think I'll ever
get to meet Mr. Hughes?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.156
So, who was it that said...

09:42.360 --> 09:44.954
"They also serve
who only stand and wait"?

09:45.200 --> 09:48.033
John Milton on his blindness.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.234
Good for you, smart cookie.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.119
You know, they say in Hollywood,

09:57.240 --> 09:58.389
a girl can get in trouble

09:58.480 --> 10:00.471
for having a case of the smarts.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.712
Not just in Hollywood, honey.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
Ha-ha.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.199
But if you or me make a move

10:08.280 --> 10:10.136
on one of these chicks,
we are dead in the water.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.878
We're history. We're fired.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.034
And the Iron Maiden has emerged.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.236
- The what?
- Iron Maiden.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.514
The virgin Marla.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.080
You did? That's horrible.

10:20.840 --> 10:21.989
Stop, you.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.150
What's going on?
I called you three times.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.356
Please, I'm late for my 4:00.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.475
What's the matter?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.616
You afraid
the old man will hear

10:28.640 --> 10:29.896
you were talking to a normal guy?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.399
Oh, please, no.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.959
Just don't, don't do this.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.157
I'm not doing anything
and neither are you.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.360
You're not allowed to do...

10:37.440 --> 10:38.680
I'm doing just fine. Thank you.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.199
You know what? Forget it.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.871
What was that about?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.349
Some guys never stop
looking to hide the salami.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.440
What?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.590
- What?
- Hide the salami.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.309
Do the deed.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.674
Dip the wick.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.113
Varnish the cane.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.435

Mam ie told me
that six months ago

11:32.960 --> 11:34.188
one of the drivers got fired

11:34.280 --> 11:35.679
because he ate dinner with her.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.960
But Sally says all the drivers

11:37.040 --> 11:38.917
have to be hired
through their churches.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.112
Fine, that doesn't make them angels.

Reverend Forbes,
do not charge the battery,

12:02.640 --> 12:04.358
if you're not going to use the lights.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.110
Unless, of course,
you'd like to be fired.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.635
Anyway, the virgin Marla's a Baptist.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.517
You do know why Baptists think
fucking is bad, don't you?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.839
Because it might lead to dancing.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.996

12:36.240 --> 12:37.958
"and bless us all our days."

12:38.040 --> 12:40.395
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.915
Glad you're feeling
better now, Mr. Bransford.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.456
Your fiancée's been doing

12:48.480 --> 12:50.198
a whale of a job
with the kennel, Frank.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.400
But the puppies all tell me
they miss you around here.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.628
Will the house you find us
have at least a tiny yard?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.119
Absolutely.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.456
And you still feel

13:00.480 --> 13:01.856
Howard Hughes
is going to be interested

13:01.880 --> 13:03.080
in developing
a housing project

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
with a kid your age?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.918
When you finally meet him.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.673
For all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.280
The Bible says that we're all sinners.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.871
And the word "sin" actually means

13:12.960 --> 13:14.188
that we've come short of

13:14.280 --> 13:15.776
God's standards.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.518
Jesus said...

13:17.600 --> 13:18.776
...that we should
love the Lord God

13:18.800 --> 13:20.096
with all our heart, mind, and soul

13:20.120 --> 13:21.920
and our neighbors ourselves.
And I think if...

13:22.560 --> 13:23.675
You think he knows?

13:24.920 --> 13:25.955
Knows what?

13:26.360 --> 13:28.237
You know, that you and I have...

13:31.160 --> 13:32.513
...gone all the way.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.399
Don't be silly.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.038
Frank, why do
all you drivers slow down

13:36.120 --> 13:37.439
and speed up again like that?

13:38.920 --> 13:40.440
These are from
the Hughes organization.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.392
Read card 4, please.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.072
Read 4.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.549
"When transporting
female contract players,

13:46.640 --> 13:49.313
"drivers will slow
to two miles per hour

13:49.400 --> 13:53.359
"at any dip, swale,
undulation or impediment

13:53.440 --> 13:55.476
"that may jostle
unsupported body parts."

13:55.560 --> 13:57.198
What does that mean, body parts?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.429
You're kidding!

13:58.520 --> 14:00.875
I haven't even met him
and he's protecting my body parts?

14:00.960 --> 14:02.712
- What does it mean?
- Mom, he means my...

14:02.800 --> 14:04.836
Oh, my God. That's outrageous!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.680
I know. How does he know
they're unsupported?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.216
- It's not amusing, Marla!
- That's what I wanna know.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.309
It's funny.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.576
It's not in the slightest
bit amusing.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.909
To treat these women
like he owns their bodies.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.056
- He doesn't own their bodies.
- To have these young girls go to class

14:15.080 --> 14:16.456
in their tiny little dance outfits.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.816
Uniforms, they're called uniforms.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.176
Have them grabbing
for their paychecks

14:19.200 --> 14:20.599
like it was bait on a hook.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.800
- Which it is.
- Mom, please.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.711
It's just so insulting
and disrespectful.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.193
And you just watch all this

14:25.280 --> 14:26.918
without saying one word,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.456
- Frank, not a single word.
- What's he going to say?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.696
Mrs. Mabrey, I've signed a contract

14:29.720 --> 14:31.278
agreeing not to talk about Mr. Hughes.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.679
Oh, have you? I can only imagine

14:32.760 --> 14:34.193
what it is you won't talk about.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.430
Do you realize my daughter's
never met Mr. Hughes?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.629
I do, ma'am.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.280
Never heard one word from him
about this screen test?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.736
You know, you've saved your money.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.875
You're a smart girl.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.838
You can buy a lot of caviar back
in Front Royal, Virginia, my dear.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.148
They don't have caviar

14:47.280 --> 14:48.416
back in Front Royal,
Virginia, my dear.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.896
Don't you be snippy with me,
young lady.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.976
Nobody's getting any younger.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.310
Mrs. Mabrey, I'd appreciate
your keeping this between us.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.038
I've never met Mr. Hughes either.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.231
I'll get it.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
Hello?

15:07.560 --> 15:08.834
- Mabrey?
- Yes, Nadine.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.096
Everything in the house is fine?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.553
Yes, everything is fine.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.936
Thank you. We would like to know,

15:12.960 --> 15:14.837
when is the screen test
for Stella Starlight?

15:14.920 --> 15:16.776
And where, for heaven's sake,
is Mr. Howard Hughes

15:16.800 --> 15:17.976
who's never been gracious enough

15:18.000 --> 15:20.468
to speak one word
to my daughter since she's been here?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.516
We are not a couple
of Virginia bumpkins.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.794
We've waited long enough.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.871
I have nothing further to say.
Good night.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.029
Marla,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.475
you turned down a scholarship
to Mary Washington.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.596
You haven't written a song
since you've been here,

15:31.680 --> 15:33.033
and you haven't even met this man

15:33.160 --> 15:35.037
who's supposedly
making your screen test.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.151
His money is not enough
to buy your time.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.336
Mom, he's the king of Hollywood,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.016
he's one of the most
respected men in America.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.120
He's some kind of a genius.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.256
Everybody wants him, he's a busy man.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.669
And you are a gifted young woman
with a wonderful future.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.352
God forbid, in a town like this.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.396
This game Howard Hughes
plays with young women,

15:48.480 --> 15:49.913
it doesn't fool me one bit.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.958
Nobody's getting any younger.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.514
We are going home.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.834
We?

16:03.720 --> 16:04.869
I love you, Mom.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.952
I'll help you pack.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.792
The Bible tells us,

16:09.880 --> 16:11.233
that whosoever
looketh on a woman

16:11.320 --> 16:12.799
to lust after her,

16:12.880 --> 16:16.475
hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.256
Someone who tells us the Bible

16:18.280 --> 16:19.696
doesn't deal with sex before marriage

16:19.720 --> 16:22.188
is simply trying
to avoid feeling guilty.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.511
There is a time to reap
and a time to sow.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.636
There is a time to embrace,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.518
and a time to refrain from embracing.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.993
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.069
How was church?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.069
Miss your mom, huh?

16:52.280 --> 16:54.032
Let's just go. I like driving.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.591
I didn't think you knew how.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.352
Ugh! I mean, I like going for a drive.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.000
I know how to drive,
or I did. Let's go.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.200
What do you mean "You did"?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.753
My dad, God rest his soul,

17:02.840 --> 17:04.136
thought women drivers
were dangerous,

17:04.160 --> 17:06.469
so I quit, then I forgot how. Okay?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.671
- What are you doing?
- You'll remember.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.336
You've got a driver's license,
don't you?

17:13.359 --> 17:15.828
Let's go. I want to show you
a place off Mulholland Drive.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.835
Wait.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.950
It's nice back here.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.149
Hey!

17:37.880 --> 17:38.915
Ooh.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.790
Oh.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.069
What do wanna show me?

17:44.160 --> 17:46.037
It's just some acreage
I wanna develop.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.553
Slow down a little bit around here.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.392
It's for affordable housing.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.152
Affordable housing?

17:51.240 --> 17:52.696
Yeah. You know,
people who aren't rich.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.392
They wanna get out of the cities,

17:54.560 --> 17:56.551
and into the suburbs.

17:56.760 --> 18:00.196
Just take a right, right here.
Take a right, right here?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.838
Never mind.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.596
The land I'm gonna show you,
the Teamsters own it.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.193
They tried making it a golf course,

18:06.280 --> 18:07.679
but nobody came.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.752
Okay, you can slow down
a little bit more, right?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.876
It's 117 acres.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.080
I feel, you know,
if you make a good deal

18:15.160 --> 18:16.798
on the land
and then you subdivide...

18:16.880 --> 18:18.233
I don't mean big houses,

18:18.320 --> 18:20.515
I mean, modest houses
for middle class families.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.828
Okay, there's...

18:24.080 --> 18:25.195
Cash is king right now.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.599
With Howard Hughes
as a backer,

18:26.680 --> 18:28.176
I mean, I know
I can make him a profit.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.668
I wanna call it Mulholland Canyon.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
You got a light.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.279
They told me again,
"Be ready to drive the boss."

18:36.760 --> 18:39.320
Wow! You might even meet the guy.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.279
I should become a driver.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.237
Well, I'm driving.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.958
I think you're right
about this place.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.629
They told me earlier,

19:15.720 --> 19:17.296
class was canceled.
They didn't call you?

19:17.320 --> 19:20.039
I never quite know
what's going on.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.152
I had such a strange day.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.873
I was outside at Schwab's,

19:25.320 --> 19:26.992
and this guy
started talking to me.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.999
It was nice, I mean he wasn't...

19:29.960 --> 19:32.110
He wasn't making
a pass at me or anything,

19:32.200 --> 19:34.350
but we talked, and he said

19:34.440 --> 19:36.829
he'd like to have dinner, and I'm...

19:38.600 --> 19:39.919
I'm just looking at him,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.718
and then I realize who I'm talking to.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.635
Bobby Darin.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.119
I said, "I can't believe it.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.428
"You're Bobby Darin."

19:51.520 --> 19:53.216
I mean, okay, he didn't know
I was an actress or anything.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.880
But I didn't even know
he was Bobby Darin.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.440
It just...

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
I...

20:21.800 --> 20:22.869
I feel...

20:24.320 --> 20:25.355
Old.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.755
Old?

20:27.840 --> 20:29.456
I mean, wouldn't you say in
Hollywood as a rule,

20:29.480 --> 20:30.976
when you've been here
as long as I have

20:31.000 --> 20:32.136
that you should have
already more or less

20:32.160 --> 20:33.160
shown what you can do?

20:33.240 --> 20:36.038
Let's be honest, maybe I'm not
the right girl for this,

20:36.160 --> 20:37.456
I mean aren't you supposed
to have big bosoms

20:37.480 --> 20:39.152
and be sexy and casual
about everything?

20:39.240 --> 20:40.878
I'm a square.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.552
I can't really act. I can't dance.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.710
I can write songs,
but I can't really sing.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.110
A movie actress should
sing songs, not write them.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.713
Wouldn't you say that's true?

20:48.800 --> 20:49.915
I mean, as a rule.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.840
I mean, in this town,
aren't those the rules?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.549
What?

20:53.640 --> 20:55.040
Come on, Frank, you know the rules.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.435
You're an exception.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.435
The rules don't apply to you.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.789
Hold on.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.709
Hello?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.358
Marla, hi.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.079
I just wanted you to know...

21:18.160 --> 21:20.230
you're meeting
with Mr. Hughes tonight.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.276
I'll send someone
to pick you up right away.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.035
Thank you.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.915
Guess what.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.556
This is the Beverly Hills Hotel?

21:36.640 --> 21:39.108
We take the private entrance
to the Polo Lounge.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.914
Hi!

21:44.040 --> 21:45.359
Oh, thank you.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.515
Oh.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.079
Would you like a cocktail?

21:48.320 --> 21:49.320
Oh...

21:49.680 --> 21:50.795
I don't drink.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.432
- Okay, I'll be in the car.
- Oh, okay.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.078
Would you follow me, Ms. Mabrey?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.359
What are you talking about?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.155
- It's dark in here.
- Have a seat.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.231
Does he always keep it this dark?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.319
Does he stay in this bungalow?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.316
Sorry, I can't say.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.117
Did I hear
he has five bungalows?

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
Hmm.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.237
What's in those bottles?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.593
That's water.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.599
From Maine.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.714
Water.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.239
From Maine.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.514
Is Frank still here?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.839
He's, uh...

23:43.960 --> 23:45.598
He's in the car.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.630
You like crossword puzzles?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.835
Yeah.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.680
Yes?

23:57.800 --> 23:58.949
Right away.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.593
Ah! Mr. Hughes. I recognize
you from your pictures.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.829
I'd like to thank you.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.096
Thank you for my acting classes,

24:43.120 --> 24:44.176
thank you for my ballet classes,

24:44.200 --> 24:45.315
thank you for the house

24:45.400 --> 24:46.456
thank you for the paycheck,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.280
and thank you for the chance
to become a star.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.548
Your name is, is...

25:07.160 --> 25:08.832
- Marla.
- Marla.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.309
- Marla Mabrey.
- Marla Mabrey. Yes.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.992
Some champagne, Marla?

25:13.560 --> 25:15.437
Oh, no. No, thank you, I don't drink.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.996
You don't like to
have a drink?

25:20.120 --> 25:21.400
No, actually I've never had one.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.473
You've never had a drink?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.435
No.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Huh.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.516
You've never had
a drink in your life?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.115
No.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.709
Good for you, good for you.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.519
You do eat, yes?

25:39.880 --> 25:41.472
I do.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.318
Yes, I do eat.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.473
Ah, gee.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.350
This is neat.
Steak, mashed potatoes,

25:50.440 --> 25:52.396
little peas.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.598
Just about every single one
of my favorites.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.631
Should I take mime, Mr. Hughes?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.376
They say it's the visual that counts.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.800
A picture's worth a thousand words.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.640
And stardom's all in
how you carry your body.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.712
Is it true Lana Turner took mime?

26:16.600 --> 26:18.033
I guess I'm just all confused.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.311
What material will I do

26:23.400 --> 26:25.280
when you do my screen test
for Stella Starlight?

27:13.840 --> 27:14.875
Nice.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.160
Yes.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.834
That's rayon, you know,

27:19.920 --> 27:21.592
the American Viscose Corporation

27:21.680 --> 27:24.558
started making rayon before the war.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.479
Good stuff.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.235
- Hello?
- Yes?

27:29.040 --> 27:31.349
Look, I want you to tell Arnold

27:31.800 --> 27:34.758
that the wing flaps are not 35.4.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.313
They're 36.9.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.392
I have told him that
not once, but twice!

27:39.480 --> 27:40.833
So take care of it!

27:43.000 --> 27:44.035
Mr. Hughes,

27:44.120 --> 27:46.190
I don't know if I have the talent

27:46.280 --> 27:47.713
to be successful in the movies,

27:47.800 --> 27:48.869
but I think I do.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.056
And I'm not insulted by your
failure to meet me sooner

27:51.080 --> 27:53.469
because I know you have your
own way of doing things.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.471
And I may be a bumpkin from Virginia,

27:55.560 --> 27:56.560
but I'm a good Christian.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.760
And I'm smart enough to know

27:57.840 --> 27:59.056
that if the rumors
I've heard about you

27:59.080 --> 28:00.896
with women were true,
you wouldn't have had time

28:00.920 --> 28:02.256
to fly a plane, let alone invent one

28:02.280 --> 28:05.750
whether the wing flaps
were 35.4 or 36.9.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.070
So I only hope I can earn
your respect for my work

28:08.160 --> 28:10.549
because you've certainly
earned my respect for yours.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.199
What is so funny?

28:12.280 --> 28:15.033
Hey, I'm gonna get busy
on the screen test.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.509
Nadine.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.794
Blessed Savior!

28:17.880 --> 28:19.216
Will you say hello to Nadine for me?

28:19.240 --> 28:20.275
She's a treasure.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.751
Nadine, I wanna get busy right away

28:22.840 --> 28:25.434
on the Stella Starlight screen test

28:25.520 --> 28:26.839
for Marla Mabrey, okay?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.399
Good. Also, make sure

28:28.480 --> 28:30.675
Harvey retouched the picture
of me in my sweater.

28:30.760 --> 28:31.829
Okay.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.794
Thanks, Marla.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.388
Thank you!

28:48.680 --> 28:50.193
So what's he really like?

28:50.720 --> 28:52.016
My mom could not have been more wrong.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.519
A total gentleman! Amazing!

28:53.600 --> 28:55.033
I mean, yes, he's not young.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.156
But the man's
an incredibly romantic figure.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.456
I mean, let's face it, he's old

28:58.480 --> 29:00.120
but everybody's got a crush
on him anyway.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.376
I don't know if it's the money

29:01.400 --> 29:02.840
or the power or the mystery or what.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.719
This is silly.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
What am I,

29:06.880 --> 29:08.313
Mamie Eisenhower in a limousine?

29:08.440 --> 29:11.113
I think maybe
it's gonna happen now, Frank.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.633
I just met Howard Hughes.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.633
Frank, that's 3:15 a.m.
Do you read me?

29:15.720 --> 29:17.119
Roger. 3:15 a.m.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.833
What's 3:15 a.m.?

29:19.280 --> 29:20.474
I'm meeting him.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.229
I pick him up here, 3:15 a.m.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.073
It is a big day!

29:26.200 --> 29:28.839
My mom could not have been
more wrong!

29:29.600 --> 29:30.794
That's water.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.315
From Maine.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.075
Water.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
From Maine.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.791
How many bathrooms did
the house you grew up in have?

29:44.720 --> 29:45.914
One.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.514
Mine, too.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.159
Keep dreaming about that house.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.559
I keep knocking walls out

29:53.640 --> 29:55.119
and making it bigger and bigger.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.556
No, no, no. I need to know
if that son of a bitch Levar,

29:58.640 --> 30:00.835
is behaving appropriately
with these girls.

30:00.920 --> 30:01.920
And by the way,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.320
I'm not sure about Wilbur either.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.553
So tonight, I'm checking out
this kid Frank Forbes.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.638
Did you ever think you'd be sittin' in

30:09.720 --> 30:12.632
your front yard listening to
the Los Angeles Philharmonic?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.917
Let's just hope nobody saw me
driving you in the front seat.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.393
Frank, I really wanna
let you know

30:50.480 --> 30:52.596
that when you told me
the rules don't apply to me

30:53.120 --> 30:54.189
it was really helpful.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
Good.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.108
You know, they don't
apply to you either.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.394
Right.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.115
Right.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.989
Right.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.870
I guess we better
say good night.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.109
Yes.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.639
Good night.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.359
Hey! You've got a date at 3:15.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.833
Bobby Darin's not coming by later?

31:58.240 --> 32:00.356
Mr. Hughes, I'm Frank.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.549
It's really an honor

32:15.640 --> 32:18.200
to have the opportunity
to drive you, Mr. Hughes.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.594
I didn't... I wasn't...

32:19.680 --> 32:20.999
I didn't know I'd be...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.833
It would happen that
I'd be driving you, but I...

32:23.960 --> 32:25.757
...or that I'd be...

32:28.960 --> 32:30.598
...meeting you, I mean.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.559
It's a nice night.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.438
Hey, do you think Levar

32:47.520 --> 32:49.351
and Wilbur are the kind of guys

32:49.440 --> 32:52.352
who might wanna
chippy on their wives?

32:52.440 --> 32:54.237
- Chippy, sir?
- Cheat.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.869
Oh! I think they're
both honest men, sir.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.190
- Not old and jaded, you know?
- No.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.748
Yeah, because that's one thing
I simply cannot abide

33:02.840 --> 33:04.910
is a married man
who chippies on his wife.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.513
I have to fire him, you know?

33:06.600 --> 33:08.750
And if anybody working for me

33:08.880 --> 33:10.711
wants to strike up a relationship

33:10.840 --> 33:12.990
with one of
our contract actresses

33:13.080 --> 33:14.433
- I have to fire him.
- Right.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.272
- I just have to do that...
- Yeah.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.158
They told me you're engaged to
be married to your...

33:20.240 --> 33:21.496
- ...seventh grade sweetheart?
- Yes.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.078
- Is that good? Yeah.
- Yes, thank you.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.718
I admire that.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.118
Tell me something.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.112
Is... What is your thinking on Sally?

33:30.200 --> 33:32.634
Or, uh...
Or Mamie, for instance?

33:32.720 --> 33:34.312
Do you think
they're straight arrows?

33:34.400 --> 33:35.879
- Straight arrows?
- Yeah.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.428
Or the Apple Blossom Queen.
Does she play around?

33:38.520 --> 33:39.589
Marla Mabrey, you mean?

33:39.680 --> 33:42.194
Marla Mabrey, yeah. Is she fast?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.271
- Fast?
- Fast. Promiscuous. Yeah.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.635
Oh, well,
everybody who knows her says

33:46.720 --> 33:48.870
she's the most devout
Christian they've ever met.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.110
Really? And does she drink?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.160
I'm told she's never had
a drink in her life, sir.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.593
- Really?
- Yes.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.756
- She go to church?
- Not far from my own.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.560
You...

33:59.680 --> 34:01.159
You go to church every Sunday?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.708
- Yes, Sir. Since I was 13.
- Really?

34:03.800 --> 34:05.677
You know, all these girls
want their own cars.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.296
But I'm telling you,
if you don't drive them,

34:07.320 --> 34:08.594
you can't keep an eye on them.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.989
And it's just a, it's just a...

34:12.080 --> 34:13.478
You gotta have

34:13.560 --> 34:14.879
- their gate keys.
- Yes.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.520
The keys to their gate,
because I'm telling you...

34:18.280 --> 34:20.714
Venereal disease
in Los Angeles County's

34:20.800 --> 34:22.791
- up something like 85%.
- Really?

34:23.159 --> 34:26.072
Are you familiar with available land
off Mulholland Drive, sir?

34:26.239 --> 34:29.755
We're very impressed
by a guy named Colton at Searle.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.313
And he seems to have come up
with something for the ladies

34:32.400 --> 34:34.231
called a birth control pill.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.992
- Birth control?
- Birth control pill.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.072
It's a contraceptive. It's Enovid.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.516
If you're smart,
you'll buy yourself some Searle stock.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.277
Mmm. Thank you for that tip, sir.

34:44.360 --> 34:45.759
You know, Hoffmann-La Roche

34:45.840 --> 34:47.637
just got a new drug
through the FDA.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.915
It's an antidepressant.
They're calling it Librium.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.199
The company's Swiss,

34:51.280 --> 34:52.576
but they've got an American division

34:52.600 --> 34:55.159
with a CEO by the name
of Bob Clark. He's part Irish.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.316
So instead of Smith Kline,

34:57.400 --> 34:59.356
or Merck, or Upjohn,
or Pfizer, or even Searle,

34:59.440 --> 35:01.749
you might wanna take a look
at Hoffmann-La Roche.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.398
Might be a heck of a stock.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.519
Uh-huh.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.868
A-ha!

35:12.000 --> 35:14.116
Oh, that's nice.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.554
Yeah.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.160
Hmm.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.496
"For food and all Thy gifts of love,

35:23.520 --> 35:24.800
"we give Thee thanks and praise.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.216
"Look down, Oh Jesus, from up above

35:26.240 --> 35:27.912
"and bless us all our days. Amen."

35:33.960 --> 35:36.428
Okay, now, what did you wanna

35:36.520 --> 35:38.829
- Oh!
- sell me on Mulholland Drive?

35:40.720 --> 35:41.720
It looks to me, sir,

35:41.800 --> 35:43.597
that this might be, excuse me,

35:45.160 --> 35:47.628
the right time to buy
a very unique piece of land.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.394
It's 117 acres. It's got everything.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.797
It's located right above Mulholland...

35:52.920 --> 35:54.399
Do you like to fly?

35:54.480 --> 35:55.959
- Fly?
- Fly.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.632
Um, no, sir.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.836
- No?
- No.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.315
Why?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.637
Uh, I never have.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.153
You never have what?

36:06.600 --> 36:08.158
Flown in a plane.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.151
You've never flown in a plane?

36:10.240 --> 36:11.355
No.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.748
Oh.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.753
No, no, no, sir.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.876
Sir, this one's on Frank Forbes.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.712
Who's Frank Forbes?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.336
I got you! I got you on that one!

36:29.360 --> 36:30.536
You got me with that one, sir. Yes.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.993
No, I know you, Frank.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.832
I know all about you. You know that?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.598
- I know all about you.
- Really?

36:37.040 --> 36:39.110
- This thing, you know...
- Mm-hmm.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.877
About two and a half months,
maybe three months

36:43.120 --> 36:44.189
gonna be ready to test.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.475
But tomorrow
we're testing a little plane.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.600
Oh, really?

36:47.680 --> 36:49.238
And I want you there with me.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.594
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.272
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.112
- You get it?
- Yes, sir.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.111
Okay. Good.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.236
You know, sometimes
I just like to come out here

36:58.360 --> 37:02.512
and just sit, have a burger,
and just talk to my plane.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.389
Hi, plane.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.551
Say hello to my plane,
will you?

37:08.280 --> 37:09.280
Hi, plane.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.873
Plane, this is Frank.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.473
And tomorrow,
we got the little plane.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.630
Mr. Hughes,
you continue this flight

37:30.720 --> 37:32.960
at the risk of endangering
a plane that has been paid for

37:33.000 --> 37:35.036
by the government
of the United States.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.953
I am trying to land
the goddamn thing!

37:39.280 --> 37:42.078
Mr. Hughes,
get on your safety frequency.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.269
Come in, please.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.936
No safety frequency.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.795
Do I...

37:52.880 --> 37:54.279
A little surprise, huh?

37:54.560 --> 37:55.595
It works. Yeah.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.596
I feel this. Do you like it?

38:02.680 --> 38:03.680
Yes, sir.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.314
Don't touch that codeine.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.976
- If you can get pushing...
- Don't tell me what to push!

38:22.000 --> 38:23.319
I invented the goddamn thing!

38:25.120 --> 38:26.758
Time for your enema, sir.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.912
Give the goddamn enema bag
to Mr. Forbes, please.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
Yes.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.438
Mr. Forbes. The enema bag.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.441
You're the only person I trust
with that thing now, Frank.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.232
I tell you, this dope stops you up.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.514
It stops you up.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.997
Buying you some of
that birth control stock.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.071
It's gonna go through
the goddamn roof.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.388
Frank, you know how old I was

38:46.480 --> 38:49.677
when I inherited the
Hughes Tool Company from my daddy?

38:51.000 --> 38:52.194
Younger than you.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.599
Mr. Hughes, I don't know

38:53.680 --> 38:54.920
that I'm really qualified to...

38:54.960 --> 38:56.916
Oh, that's gonna be
a bad scar.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.869
What do I...

39:00.240 --> 39:01.753
What do I do with that?

39:04.120 --> 39:06.031
I'll check on it, Mr. Forbes.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.235
Lana Turner's roses
are better than mine.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.433
But look at these!

39:14.600 --> 39:15.874
Daisies.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.430
So unexpected.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.752
Jean Peters is smart.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.390
Mr. Forbes, Nadine is on the phone.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.356
Where I come from,
daisies are cheap.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.994
- Yeah?
- Frank, it's about...

39:29.080 --> 39:30.274
Yes, hello, Nadine.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.640
I've been on duty
at the hospital

39:31.720 --> 39:32.948
a hundred percent of my time.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.256
It's a little difficult
for me to count

39:34.280 --> 39:35.640
how many gallons of gas
that I used

39:35.720 --> 39:37.080
before Mr. Hughes
had his accident.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.874
Thank you.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.360
You've moved up.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.509
Mr. Forbes.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.994
It's been a while.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.715
They need you.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.628
Okay. Uh...

39:53.040 --> 39:55.315
Bobby Darin's
not sending you daisies?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.399
Okay, fine. I get it.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.118
I have to still
sit in the back seat.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.320
But if we're going to lunch,

40:08.360 --> 40:09.680
do we eat at the same table,
or...

40:09.760 --> 40:12.672
No. I'm eating in the kitchen,
of course.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.631
I think, you know what?

40:14.720 --> 40:17.154
Why don't you just drive?
I should sit in the back seat.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.753
I don't know why I'm,
you know...

40:19.240 --> 40:22.118
I guess nobody can say
we don't follow the rules.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.896
"For food
and all Thy gifts of love,

40:24.920 --> 40:26.194
"we give Thee thanks
and praise.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.633
"Look down, Oh Jesus,

40:27.720 --> 40:29.597
"from above and bless us all
our days. Amen."

40:29.680 --> 40:31.750
Amen. I can't believe it.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.936
He's finally out of the hospital,

40:32.960 --> 40:34.439
and right away
you fly to Washington?

40:34.520 --> 40:35.999
You're gonna miss my screen test.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.318
I heard Eisenhower sent him
a telegram.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.576
If Eisenhower
was really smart,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.114
he'd have Howard Hughes
just bomb Moscow,

40:42.200 --> 40:43.576
and have communism over
and done with.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.716
I think Howard Hughes
should be president.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.640
There's nobody like him.
He's on another level.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.680
Seriously, the poor man,

40:48.800 --> 40:50.136
he's gotta deal with these
TWA stockholders

40:50.160 --> 40:52.176
who are crabbing about moving
from propellers to jets.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.394
At the same time,

40:53.480 --> 40:55.016
he now has to convince
the United States Senate

40:55.040 --> 40:56.439
that the Hercules can fly.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.120
So you're gonna fly to Washington?

40:58.160 --> 41:00.549
I will not be flying.
Thank you for asking. I will be taking

41:00.640 --> 41:01.696
the train early in the morning.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.278
When does Sarah move to LA?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.190
Um, well, I...

41:08.440 --> 41:11.193
Don't know if Sarah and I are...

41:17.120 --> 41:21.159
She still believes that
once you've been intimate

41:21.240 --> 41:22.719
or gone all the way
with a person,

41:22.800 --> 41:24.791
that in the eyes of God

41:24.880 --> 41:26.632
you're committed to that person

41:26.720 --> 41:28.233
for the rest of your life.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.675
So she believes
since you and she have...

41:34.040 --> 41:36.315
...gone all the way,
that you're already married?

41:38.480 --> 41:39.674
I agree with Sarah.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.873
That's why I've never done it.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.713
That's why I'm waiting,
because I have to be sure.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.752
Well that's, I mean,
that's a little...

41:47.840 --> 41:49.592
I'm not legally married.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.750
Senator,
I have come here to testify

42:00.840 --> 42:02.592
of my own free will.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.309
Senator, I have come here to
testify of my own free will.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.833
Wait. Senator,

42:07.960 --> 42:11.475
I have come here to testify
of my own free will.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.832
Senator, I have come here to
testify of my own free will.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.639
Any word on
the possibility of me...

42:31.040 --> 42:32.473
...getting a ticker tape parade?

42:36.000 --> 42:39.197
They don't have ticker tape
parades in Washington, Howard.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.835
There are no skyscrapers here.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.316
Do you think I don't know
what you're planning?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.400
What I'm planning?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.675
What you're planning.
You think I'm nuts, right?

42:53.040 --> 42:54.040
You think I'm nuts.

42:54.120 --> 42:55.599
Howard, all I said was,

42:55.680 --> 42:57.432
I think you should see someone.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.078
"See someone?"

42:59.160 --> 43:01.230
I really think you need help, kid.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.992
See someone?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.559
What are you talking about?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.756
Do you realize
that I'm trying to move

43:06.840 --> 43:09.274
an entire airline
from propellers to jets?

43:09.360 --> 43:11.032
And the stockholders could hear

43:11.120 --> 43:13.759
that I am sitting in a loony bin

43:13.840 --> 43:15.910
locked up with some psychiatrist

43:16.000 --> 43:17.911
who can declare me
to be incompetent

43:18.000 --> 43:20.468
and then I have to give
the whole goddamn business

43:20.560 --> 43:23.154
over to some
goddamn conservator?

43:23.440 --> 43:24.668
You do realize that?

43:29.360 --> 43:31.396
I'll be in my room, Howard.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.319
What are you looking at?

43:38.840 --> 43:40.398
You got any ideas?
Speak up.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.376
I think you represent
to the majority of this committee,

43:42.400 --> 43:45.710
what is great about capitalism
as opposed to communism.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.518
I think these people
are scared of you,

43:47.600 --> 43:48.953
and I think they wanna be you.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.496
I don't think
you have to practice

43:50.520 --> 43:51.736
what you're gonna
say like this.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.988
I think you can go in there,

43:53.080 --> 43:54.149
and try not even knowing

43:54.240 --> 43:55.736
what you're gonna say
until you say it.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.957
And you're not, in my opinion,
gonna say the wrong thing.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.195
Huh.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.714
You know...

44:06.840 --> 44:09.673
You know how old I was
when I took over my daddy's company?

44:10.520 --> 44:11.839
I was younger than you.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.154
Did I tell you that?

44:14.240 --> 44:15.673
Roll film.

44:22.280 --> 44:23.713
Okay. Darling, relax.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.513
Tell us a little about yourself.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.951
Okay. I'm from
Front Royal, Virginia.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.357
I've always been interested
in speech and dramatics.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.512
- I write songs.
- Turn to your left.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.638
Can you raise
your chin up a little?

44:38.720 --> 44:40.551
Great.
Keep talking.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.354
I was going to go
to Mary Washington College,

44:43.440 --> 44:45.590
where I intended
to major in English.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.113
Okay, can you turn
to your right?

44:47.200 --> 44:50.033
But keep talking, and chin up.
Major in English, go on.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.269
Um...

44:51.360 --> 44:54.272
But I decided
when I won a talent contest

44:54.360 --> 44:56.112
that maybe I'd give it a go
in Hollywood.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.758
Okay, can you turn
to your right?

44:58.600 --> 45:01.672
Great, great, great. Okay.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.153
Do you sing?

45:04.560 --> 45:06.232
Well, sort of.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.514
Should I keep talking?

45:08.640 --> 45:09.914
Okay, turn to your left.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.993
Do you swim?

45:12.080 --> 45:13.115
Sure!

45:13.200 --> 45:15.191
Wardrobe,
do we have any bathing suits?

45:17.440 --> 45:20.079
If you ever wanted
to slip out for a bite or something,

45:20.160 --> 45:22.594
I think we could do
that under the radar.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.576
Mr. Hughes,

45:25.600 --> 45:28.160
the American people
wanna know if someone

45:28.240 --> 45:31.038
is making a profit
on a plane that can't fly!

45:31.120 --> 45:32.348
Senator...

45:32.440 --> 45:36.558
I have come here to testify
of my own free will.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.112
Nobody's making any profit.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.399
This plane will be used
for testing and research

45:49.480 --> 45:52.836
and advancing the art of
aviation in this country.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.876
In a few more days, it'll fly.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.076
I have stated that
if it were to be a failure,

45:57.160 --> 45:59.435
I would leave this country
and never come back.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.520
And I mean it!

46:00.600 --> 46:02.158
It'll fly, Senator.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.395
It'll fly.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.755
Howard Hughes's
giant plane has flown.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.798
And at the controls, the successful
designer, builder, owner,

46:08.880 --> 46:11.314
airspeed record holder,
multimillionaire himself,

46:11.400 --> 46:12.435
Howard Hughes.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.750
Bravo!

46:15.840 --> 46:18.035
Billionaire, goddamn it,
not millionaire.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.056
And what the hell happened
to the close-up of me

46:20.080 --> 46:21.115
in the cockpit? You know,

46:21.200 --> 46:22.792
the plane flew
for one mile,

46:22.880 --> 46:24.871
and nobody knows
if it'll ever fly again.

46:24.960 --> 46:28.111
And they know what it cost.
That does me no good

46:28.200 --> 46:30.031
at TWA. All right,
thank you, gentlemen.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.076
Thank you very much. Greg?

46:32.680 --> 46:33.840
Yes, Howard?

46:34.680 --> 46:35.749
Howard?

46:36.600 --> 46:37.635
Howard?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.176
I gotta know
what legal steps I gotta take

46:40.200 --> 46:42.760
to keep these people
from sticking me with a psychiatrist,

46:42.840 --> 46:45.035
and then committing me
to an insane asylum...

46:45.120 --> 46:46.678
Then declaring me
to be incompetent,

46:46.760 --> 46:49.672
and then turning over
my entire business to a conservator.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.716
You gotta tell me
what I have to do...

46:51.800 --> 46:53.916
To legally keep them
from doing that, okay?

46:54.040 --> 46:55.439
Call me back.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.278
Hello?

47:02.360 --> 47:04.476
Hello, ma'am.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.675
I was informed that

47:05.800 --> 47:07.836
your television antenna
was defective.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.831
I brought over
the newest model.

47:09.920 --> 47:13.071
And I was wondering
if you would...

47:16.360 --> 47:18.999
I just saw your screen test.
You were great.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.633
It was great!

47:23.000 --> 47:24.228
Really?

47:25.920 --> 47:28.878
Well...
I thought it was pretty awful!

47:28.960 --> 47:30.234
You were great.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.750
They just wanted to see me
in a bathing suit!

47:34.840 --> 47:35.955
I didn't do it.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.831
But they didn't say anything
when it was over.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.188
You've got something
these guys

47:42.280 --> 47:43.952
don't even know about yet.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.600
I mean, wait till
Howard Hughes sees it.

47:50.600 --> 47:54.229
I have two more of these
in the car, just in case.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.955
Daisies.

48:05.760 --> 48:08.149
And not from Jean Peters?

48:08.280 --> 48:10.160
Well, they could be.
They could be from anybody.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.038
They just, according to the rules,
can't be from me.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.638

- What?
- He's driving me to class.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.629
This is my fault.

51:04.720 --> 51:05.856
This is all my fault.
This is my fault.

51:05.880 --> 51:06.976
No, no.
This is not your fault.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.831
This is all my fault.
This is my fault.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.791
And it's fine.
Let's face it, it's fine.

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
I sang you the song.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.096
This is my fault.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.120
This is all my fault.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.195
There's a broom and a dustpan
in there, okay?

51:18.480 --> 51:20.710
Wait, tell Levar
I brought the antenna. Okay.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.040
Hi, come on in.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.155
Hi.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.616
Oh, Frank and I were trying
to make space

51:34.640 --> 51:36.835
- for the TV and...
- Wow.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.433
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks!

51:38.520 --> 51:40.192
Sure.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.635
Wait. What, what time is it?
We're gonna be late for class.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.790
Oh, no,
you're not going to class.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.518
Mr. Hughes wants to see you.

51:46.600 --> 51:47.600
Now?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.352
Yeah, yeah,
I thought they called you.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.558
I'm supposed
to take you over there.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.788
Hey, Levar.

51:57.880 --> 51:58.880
Hi, Frank.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.315
They sent me over
with the new antenna.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.469
It didn't work though.

52:02.560 --> 52:04.073
We were trying to move the TV.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.576
- I'll do that. I'll do it.
- No, no, no.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.296
I'll do that, I'll do that.
Yeah, be careful of your feet.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.816
I'll get the other
antennas from the car.

52:08.840 --> 52:11.520
No! I'll do that! Because I know
that you're late. So I'll get them.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.795
Boy.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.108
I'm, uh...

52:14.880 --> 52:16.359
I'm gonna get some towels.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.990
I just don't know how this
stands with the church.

52:19.080 --> 52:20.336
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go to Fresno.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.080
- I'm gonna talk to Sarah.
- You're married!

52:22.120 --> 52:23.189
You're a married man!

52:23.280 --> 52:24.776
- I'm gonna be honest with her.
- I know that!

52:24.800 --> 52:25.896
- I have been with her since...
- You're right.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.136
...we were in
the seventh grade together.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.576
What's been happening with us
is not your fault.

52:28.600 --> 52:29.776
But I've behaved
like a cheap floozy.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.096
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.216
I'm not some disgusting
tease of a virgin...

52:32.240 --> 52:33.416
- You've done nothing wrong!
- ...trying to steal

52:33.440 --> 52:34.656
another woman's husband.
Are you listening to me?

52:34.680 --> 52:35.590
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.736
I am not trying to steal
another woman's husband.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.936
- You've done nothing wrong.
- You're not an adulterer.

52:37.960 --> 52:38.995
You're married, Frank.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.433
- You're not...
- You're...

52:40.520 --> 52:41.555
Need help?

52:41.640 --> 52:44.359
No, thanks, Levar. I'm just gonna
change my clothes. Thanks, Frank.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.634
See you later.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.268
I hired you as my double
because you look exactly like me.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.191
The shoes are all wrong.
Now, get out of here.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.436
They'll be more
exacting next time, sir.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.311
Okay. That, that
you cannot legally

53:01.400 --> 53:03.755
commit a person
to an insane asylum

53:03.840 --> 53:06.718
if they are married and their spouse
refuses to commit to it?

53:06.800 --> 53:08.279
- Yes, sir.
- Uh-huh.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.430
Well, what if there is no spouse?

53:11.480 --> 53:14.358
Greg, I got 30,000 people
working for me

53:14.440 --> 53:17.398
on weapons the Pentagon
would trust nobody else to do,

53:17.480 --> 53:19.072
and you're telling me go out

53:19.160 --> 53:21.071
and get a wife to stay out
of the loony bin?

53:21.160 --> 53:23.196
After your meeting,
what would you think about

53:23.280 --> 53:26.397
sneaking out
some place totally private?

53:26.480 --> 53:29.278
Yes, ring
Mr. Brian Forester, please.

53:33.920 --> 53:35.114
Brian Forester.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.315
This is Howard Hughes.

53:36.440 --> 53:37.509
Hello, Mr. Hughes.

53:37.600 --> 53:41.798
We've traveled a long way, sir,
to discuss TWA. We were just hoping

53:41.880 --> 53:44.269
we could skip over
and say a quick hello.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.237
We're in the same hotel,
after all.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.958
You could just be
a few feet away!

53:48.040 --> 53:49.678
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Forester.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.034
I will talk to you later.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.516
Hi. Want some ice cream?

53:55.600 --> 53:57.113
No, thank you.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.877
Bit on top.
Yes, yes. That's good.

54:16.720 --> 54:19.473
- The young lady is here, Mr. Hughes.
- Oh.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.710
Also, Mr. Forester,
the Merrill Lynch man,

54:21.800 --> 54:23.074
- called again.
- Uh-huh.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.151
They're in bungalow 8-A.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.918
They wanna know
which bungalow you're in.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Uh-huh.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.149
They wanna see you.

54:29.280 --> 54:32.113
There's no need for anyone
to know what bungalow I'm in.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.912
Yeah, just give me...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

54:44.000 --> 54:47.709
Good, good, good. Okay.
And, you can take...

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
Be careful.

54:50.680 --> 54:52.272
Yeah, because...

54:52.360 --> 54:53.475
You, uh...

54:53.600 --> 54:55.079
Uh-huh.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.159
Yeah, yeah. That's good.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.990
And a little bit more over.
That's good.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.149
Hey. Hey.

55:22.240 --> 55:24.470
Argh! Get that person
outta here!

55:29.040 --> 55:31.031
Let's find your mommy
and daddy.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.456
So are we finished
with this haircut or not?

55:32.480 --> 55:34.869
How should I know?
He's very exacting.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.598
Exacting's not even
the word for that.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.477
I don't look like him!

55:46.160 --> 55:47.798
So now you're telling me

55:47.880 --> 55:49.393
to just go get married
to somebody

55:49.480 --> 55:51.277
who's nice enough to keep people

55:51.360 --> 55:53.351
from putting me into an insane asylum?

55:53.440 --> 55:55.317
Also, I'm running outta codeine.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.680
Sarah, we should take
a little bit of time.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.638
We need to take time
to think.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.239
Well, hello.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.075
What did you say?

56:26.160 --> 56:27.752
I said hello!

56:29.400 --> 56:30.400
Mm-hmm.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.596
It's been a while, Mr. Hughes.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.159
Huh?

56:34.800 --> 56:37.360
It's been a while
since we met.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.396
I have a telephone message
from Mr. Forester.

56:39.480 --> 56:40.515
Read it.

56:40.600 --> 56:42.511
"We came at your request to lend you

56:42.600 --> 56:45.398
- "$400 million for TWA.
- Mm-hmm.

56:45.480 --> 56:47.516
"Shouldn't we at least
be allowed to meet you,

56:47.600 --> 56:49.636
"as the person who controls TWA,

56:49.760 --> 56:50.760
"face-to-face?"

56:50.840 --> 56:52.319
What was his tone?

56:53.320 --> 56:54.799
- Nervous.
- Service?

56:55.920 --> 56:57.035
Nervous!

56:57.120 --> 56:59.076
Ah, yeah.
Well, okay, thank you.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.593
Yeah, it has been

57:01.800 --> 57:04.758
a while since we were able
to see one another, Marla.

57:04.840 --> 57:07.070
I do see your name
on my check every week.

57:07.680 --> 57:09.636
That's sort of like
seeing you.

57:09.720 --> 57:10.869
Would you excuse me?

57:20.080 --> 57:21.274
Shut the door.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.633
What the hell
is she doin' here?

57:24.720 --> 57:26.597
You said you wanted the girl
with the two M's.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.989
That's not her.
That's Marla Mabrey.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.638
She's a Baptist nun,
for Christ's sake.

57:30.720 --> 57:32.915
That's the only one
on the payroll with two M's.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.911
Did it occur to you
that maybe the one

57:35.000 --> 57:37.833
that I wanted with the two M's
was not on the payroll?

57:38.640 --> 57:40.631
Ah! You meant Marilyn Monroe?

57:40.720 --> 57:41.914
Who?

57:42.080 --> 57:43.308
Marilyn Monroe? Her?

57:43.400 --> 57:44.992
Yes! Marilyn Monroe!

57:45.640 --> 57:47.756
I'll get rid of her at once.
I apologize, sir.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.920
- Marilyn. I'll get Marilyn.
- No. Hey, wait, wait...

57:52.960 --> 57:54.360
I'll get rid of her.
You go on home.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.274
How's your mother?

58:24.360 --> 58:26.510
She's very well.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.113
Uh-huh.

58:30.760 --> 58:32.079
Bankers.

58:33.480 --> 58:35.277
Big boys from New York.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.555
From what I read,

58:39.640 --> 58:42.154
bankers work in extremely
conventional ways.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.075
I don't pretend to understand
the airline business,

58:46.160 --> 58:47.673
but I'm told you say propellers

58:47.760 --> 58:49.671
are a thing of the past.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.576
Well, I think your mother
probably thought I was okay

58:51.600 --> 58:53.431
as long as she was sure that

58:53.520 --> 58:55.000
we had nothin' to do with each other.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.376
I think she thought that if I had been

58:57.400 --> 58:58.833
just one of those girls

58:58.920 --> 59:01.354
you wouldn't have real respect
for my integrity.

59:01.440 --> 59:03.032
Ah.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.439
I mean, I guess a girl's always

59:04.560 --> 59:06.118
got a reputation to think about.

59:06.520 --> 59:08.272
Well, I guess a man always

59:08.360 --> 59:10.112
has a reputation to think about.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.278
- Uh...
- Hello?

59:16.360 --> 59:17.360
Mr. Forester?

59:17.440 --> 59:18.919
Mr. Hughes?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.434
Listen, I don't think
there's any real

59:21.520 --> 59:23.158
necessity for us to meet.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.629
I mean, there's no reason
why we can't do this

59:25.720 --> 59:26.630
on the telephone.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.597
Well, let me be plain, sir.

59:28.680 --> 59:32.355
I am not authorized to approve
our venture to lend you

59:32.440 --> 59:36.149
$400 million unless we meet.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.354
Mr. Hughes?

59:41.040 --> 59:42.189
Mr. Hughes?

59:43.880 --> 59:45.472
If there's a Stella Starlight script,

59:45.600 --> 59:46.828
you could have fooled me.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.752
Did you look at my screen test?

59:49.840 --> 59:51.273
Mr. Hughes, please just

59:51.400 --> 59:52.656
tell us what bungalow you're in.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.079
It would be so very easy.

59:54.160 --> 59:57.835
We're, we're 14 feet away.
Five feet away? Twenty feet away?

59:57.920 --> 59:59.831
Which one is your bungalow?
We'll come to you!

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.273
Uh, Mr. Forester...

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.669
I'm sorry, I don't think there's any

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.876
need for us to actually meet.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.151
There's no reason why we shouldn't

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.117
be able to do this on the telephone.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.280
Mr. Hughes?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Mr. Hughes?

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.555
These guys wanna have
a face-to-face meeting with me,

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.074
and then be able to say I'm crazy.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.878
And then I'll have to give up control

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.032
of TWA to them. It's just...

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.678
Well, maybe you'd teach them a lesson

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.273
if you just gave it to them.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.056
Then they could sue me
for a whole lot of money,

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.960
and then they may come after
my daddy's company,

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.032
and so I really
can't afford to let them

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.917
make me some kind
of a psychiatric case.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.355
I would leave this country
and never come back.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.036
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.434
You know?

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.476
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.760
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.472
What, I'm not gonna do it.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.256
They just have a face-to-face
meeting with me,

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.429
and then call me a nut?

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.112
Well, that's ridiculous!

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.589
And you have all your
own people around you

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.438
who you know you can trust.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.595
May I give you some advice?

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.908
Yes.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.470
Never trust anybody.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.992
Not me, not anybody.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.593
They're not your mommy
or your daddy.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.989
The only person
you can trust is you.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.153
Do you have children?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.350
Me?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.634
- No?
- No.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.396
I'm afraid that I'm still
more of a son than a father.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.391
But I'll tell you somethin'
very important,

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.152
that a couple of limeys
came up with

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.639
three or four years ago.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.269
Little thing called DNA,

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.158
and we're workin' with it
over at my foundation.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.196
In a sense,
you are your father,

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.033
because his DNA
is still inside of you.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.314
It keeps goin' on,

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.016
and your father had nothing
to say about it.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.792
That's what makes him
still alive.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.792
DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.871
It's got all the genetic
instructions

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.872
that cause all of the function
and development of all

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.918
known living organisms.
It's the basic,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.070
hereditary material
in human beings,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.674
and it's gonna replicate,
and replicate, and replicate,

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.512
whether we want it to or not.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.717
You have no choice.
It's just gonna keep going.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.279
It's gonna keep you alive.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.957
What if Stella Starlight sang?

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.118
You know, make the movie a musical.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.513
I can sing!

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.757
Well, but nobody should have children

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.308
if they don't want to.
That's for sure.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.711
Yeah. Well, anyway,

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.554
if I lost my daddy's company,
it'd be like losing my daddy.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.278
Those finance people are jackals.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480
Jackals?

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
Jackals.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.068
Why should you meet with them?

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.517
And so what
if you repeat yourself a lot?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.430
It adds emphasis.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.875
Emphasis?

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.079
Have you heard from people
that I'm crazy?

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.197
Well, if what you are
is crazy, then,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.194
then give me more crazy!

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.191
You're not crazy.
You're just...

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:02.956
Smart.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.474
You are not like other people.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.589
You're an exception.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.589
Hello?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.473
- Mr. Hughes?
- Um...

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.269
I am not going to be able
to talk to you until later.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.515
What is later?

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.999
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Mr. Hughes?

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.318

Is that a compliment, Howard?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.113
You're not calling me Mr. Hughes.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.193
Makes me feel so much younger.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.077
Good, Howard!

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.272
Now, how would you like
to forget about

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.954
bringing the entire
American aerospace industry

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.798
into the inevitable future

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.350
and drive to Palm Springs
in a car?

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.793
They say it's like heaven.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.638
If I had a car, I'd drive you there.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.233
All you girls should have cars.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.710
And we should tear up
your term contract

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.995
and just make it a picture
a year for three years.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.435
$100,000 a picture, okay?

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.437
It doesn't seem real to me.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.753
That's what's real.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.193
You think it's crazy to trust
your gut instinct?

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.271
"There is a tide
in the affairs of men,

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.590
"which taken at the flood
lead on to fortune.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.758
"Omitted, all the voyage of their life

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.836
"is bound in shallows
and in miseries."

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920
Yes.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.280
"There is a time for everything.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.271
"A time to reap and a time to sow.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.280
"A time to abstain from embracing,

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.231
"and there is a time to embrace."

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.397
We don't need a justice of the peace.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.951
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.909
Wait.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.078
Careful.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.629
Yeah.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.119
Yeah. That's it.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.989
What do you mean
we need time to think?

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.036
I just, I mean that...

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.840
We've been thinking
since the seventh grade.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:22.000
I only mean that we should
take a little bit of time.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.990
You know, we're not
in the seventh grade anymore.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.069
I'm just saying it's probably...

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.475
You mean you need
time to think.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.515
Get me Greg.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.109
Yes, Howard?

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.269
- Greg?
- Yes?

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.839
I've changed my mind. Get the plane.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.313
I'm going to Vegas in one hour.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.674
Howard, no air...

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.154
Mr. Hughes,
do you want my money?

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.072
Do you want my money?

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.438
Do you want my money or not?

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.234
The hell with TWA,
you son of a bitch!

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.439
We're flying American Airlines
back to New York!

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.599
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.999
Wow!

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.193
This is great!

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.952
They're giving all the girls cars.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.076
They told me at headquarters.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.388
But I can't make mine start.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.152
- Really?
- No.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.037
Do you want me to...

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Um...

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.875
- It's probably flooded.
- Flooded?

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.798
Yeah. It's flooded.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.431
Um, you have to
wait a little.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.159
Did somebody give that to you?

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.188
Who gave that to you?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.229
You're a married man, Frank.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.351
- I...
- Who gave that to you?

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.476
I can't do this
with you anymore.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.039
I'm seeing someone.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.549
It's private.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.073
I'm not gonna
discuss it with you.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.349
- Nadine!
- Yes?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.509
Hi, it's Marla.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.669
Marla, hi.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.069
Would you please ask
Mr. Hughes to call me back?

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.718
I'm sorry, Marla.
All I can say is

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.990
he's gonna be out
of town for a month.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.672
Possibly five weeks.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.552
Anything I can help with?

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.312
Well, could you tell
him I've decided

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.152
against the agreement
we discussed?

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.232
I can't do it.
I just can't do it.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.238
I'll give him your message.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.639
Okay. Thank you.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.152
I used to have a life.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.559
Walter O'Malley,

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.816
the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.479
has announced the team will
be moving to Los Angeles.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.674
Also, a bulletin just in
about Howard Hughes.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.877
Howard Hughes just
announced he's married.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.030
And wouldn't you know,
he married an actress.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.872
The new Mrs. Hughes is

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.757
Hollywood actress, Jean Peters.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.673
In other news,
Premier Khrushchev told the United...

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.113
Oh, my God.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.675
Jean Peters hit the jackpot!

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.216
Sally told me
he was moving to Las Vegas

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.753
for a while, but not to get married.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.976
And meanwhile, he's out of town,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.433
and he's got poor Frank and Levar

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.272
cooped up in the studio
all day and night.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.912
I'm gonna go down to RKO tomorrow

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.416
and tell Levar why you can't believe

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.351
anything Howard Hughes ever says.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.153
I've had it with Howard Hughes.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.800
Mamie, I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you later.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.716
Hey, Mamie.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360
Hello, gentlemen.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.256
I don't want anybody knowing
I'm not in Las Vegas.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.350
They cannot know I'm in Los Angeles.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.112
We got some things to catch up on.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.191
Just tell what's his name,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.998
to walk over to the White House

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.278
and loan the vice president's
brother $205,000.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.396
Read me back the last page of my memo

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.118
on my wife's missing cat.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.474
Yes, Mr. Hughes.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.512
"I have been in Las Vegas
for 37 hours now.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.556
"I have been told there has not been

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.278
"one iota of progress

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.591
"in Los Angeles in the search
for my wife's missing cat.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.876
"I want somebody who is an expert

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.837
"in the ways of animals of this type.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.593
"Los Angeles is not the jungle.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.592
"It is not the Everglades.
It is not New York City

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.318
"with the dense population.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.834
"If a zoo had lost some
valuable animal

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.558
"in the Los Angeles area,

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.313
"there would have been
25 or 30 men

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.231
"scouring the countryside,

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.438
"men skilled in the habits and
ways of an animal of this kind

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.317
"and would have found it by now."

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.073
"I feel that there is
absolutely no reason why

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.913
"a search should not
have been instigated

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.195
"for this animal, equal in any way

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.872
"to what would have happened

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.509
"if some damned train
had broken down here

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.912
"and some leopard or panther
or whatnot had escaped.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.357
"There is absolutely no reason

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.479
"and having the resources and
organization that I have got,

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.869
"there is no goddamned

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.277
"There are many, many, many things

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.759

"I hope you will read

"because I have never meant anything

"more sincerely than I mean this.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.591
"Signed, Howard R. Hughes."

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.399
It's 26 pages long, Mr. Hughes.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.629
We have four carbon copies.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.270
Hello?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.839
Howard, I'm here.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.599
- You wanted to see me.
- I'm married now, Noah.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.875
Do you still think
I need to be seen

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.155
by these TWA people?

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.416
Well, you're going to have to let them

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.032
look at you eventually, Howard.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
Admit it, Noah.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.760
You can't legally commit me
to an insane asylum,

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.273
because I have married a woman

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.952
that I have known
and trusted for years,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:08.950
and you know very well

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.917
that she would never
give her consent to it.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.793
I love you, Noah,
but you're not my father.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.074
You're fired.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.310
You've been replaced.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.238
He's lucky to have you, Frank.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680
Good luck, son.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.960
Don't let him start to think
you're trying to be his father.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.430
The vice president's
brother is apparently

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.351
not in Washington, D.C., this week.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.839
We think he's in Miami.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.150
And he will supposedly...

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.593
His secretary said he'll be back

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.716
sometime in the middle

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.153
or end of next week.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.376
So if we need to get in touch
with him or send him anything,

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.436
we can do it sometime
towards the middle...

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.272
- Frank, Frank, Frank.
- Yes, Mr. Hughes?

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.590
Does he know I'm back in Los Angeles?

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.438
I don't wanna have to call him again.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.239
I want banana nut ice cream.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.835
Hey. Excuse me.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.154
What are you doing?

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:40.990
What's going on?

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.776
- Stella Starlight!
- What are you talking about?

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.995
Stella Starlight is a really,
really stupid title

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.479
for a really stupid movie.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.840
But not nearly as stupid as I am

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.896
- for thinking he'd ever make it.
- What are you talking about?

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.309
First, he gives me a lot of
junk about how great I am.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.856
And now I can't get him on the phone.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.474
He hasn't even bothered to
look at my stupid screen test!

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.096
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute for what?

01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.400
- Wait a minute.
- Howard Hughes?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.839
Is that who you're waiting for?

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.798
I think you should take some time.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.791
And maybe don't try
to advise me on my career.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.136
How could I advise you
on your career?

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.200
I have no idea what's
going on in your life or where

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.256
you're getting your advice
from. And I'm not asking.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.554
I'm not asking about your ring.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.675
I'm not asking...

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.436
Reverend Forbes, banana nut.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.310
You know, I don't know
if I still got a shot at her.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.118
But if anybody does, trust me,

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.776
it's the Reverend Frank Forbes
of Fresno.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800
Stop.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.717
Mr. Hughes, I think maybe
now is a good time

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.736
to deal with the acreage
that I spoke to you about

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.069
the canyon off Mulholland Drive.
I've got a plan.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.390
The time for suburban
development has come.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.277
Its time has come... And, and...

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.396
Mulholland Canyon is gonna be gold.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.708
And you know what Victor Hugo

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.256
once said?
"There's nothing so powerful

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.952
"as an idea whose time

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.473
"has come."

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.696
I would like to just drive you

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.936
- out there tomorrow and show you.
- Howard, it's Bob Maheu.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.428
On my first day as your new CEO,

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.656
I must tell you that if you don't

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.079
let these people from TWA see you,

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.391
they can make you be
seen by them in court.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.913
Bob. Bob, Bob.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.912
Nobody makes me be seen anywhere.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.558
You got that?

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.596
However, I am...

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.513
I am making you be seen tonight

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.478
in Las Vegas, Nevada,
with our entire staff.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.949
We're all gonna be there,
we're all flyin' in tonight.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.235
We're moving to Nevada.
You wanna know why?

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.675
Because I am selling TWA.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.835
Selling TWA?

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.514
There's no state tax in Nevada, Frank.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.675
Howard?

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.696
And if you're still
afraid of flyin'...

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.720
Howard?

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.336
...you know, you better
get in the car soon,

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.635
because it's a three hour
and 47 minute drive.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.720
Howard?

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.240
Is that banana nut?

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.115
Uh...

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.553
Banana nut, sir. Yeah.

Mr. President,

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.433
I know how well you understand

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.954
that there is no one who
has done more than I have

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.519
to rid Hollywood of communists.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.909
And please allow me
to clarify, once more,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.036
the extreme danger all Americans

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.271
will face in living
anywhere near a nuclear test site.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.351
Sincerely, Howard R. Hughes.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.392
Elvis Presley, Pat Boone,
Frankie Avalon, Bobby Darin.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.616
I mean, what do you think a guy
like Bobby Darin makes on something

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.675
like "Beyond The Sea"?

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.136
Frank, how's it going on

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.559
the banana nut ice cream front?

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.790
The company's definitely
not making it anymore.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.518
But the good news is we located

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.591
the last batch, 350 gallons.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.477
And the company's
being very cooperative.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640
Let's buy it.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.479
The company's not for sale, sir.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.312
The ice cream! Buy all of it.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.312
- How does it get here?
- By refrigerated truck.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.536
Well, why don't we fly it in?

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.312
Ice cream does not travel
well on airplanes.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.231
Why don't we look into a...

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.871
- ...refrigerated truck?
- That's a great idea, sir.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.896
Mr. Hughes, I'm finding more
and more tax advantages

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.360
for buying up real estate in Nevada.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.910
With accelerated depreciation,
you get just as much on hotels

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.798
- as you would on, on shopping centers.
- It's the White House again.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.720
Mr. Hughes, the White House
is calling again...

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.075
I want banana nut ice cream!

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.037
I am in the middle of a desert!

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.752
Are you not in the desert with me?

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.398
Is it not hot enough for the desert?

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.758
Where do I put 350 gallons
of ice cream, huh?

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.193
The same flavor!

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.998
All of it is banana nut!

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.355
All of it is banana nut! Carlos?

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.200
Frank, we've been waiting
here for six weeks.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.919
I am his chief executive officer.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.353
I have to meet him.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.589
I understand, Mr. Maheu.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.755
Of course, you're right.
In California, abortion's...

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.149
...not legal.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.200
You might wanna give
the whole thing more thought.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.631
♪ Jingle bells ♪

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.312
♪ Jingle bells ♪

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.470
♪ Jingle all the way... ♪

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.391
Howard, I think we should meet.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.392
Moe Dalitz says he needs
you to change floors.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.913
They own the hotel.

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.835
The mob is nothing to be fooled with.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.150
Can we please meet?

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.071
Look, you ask that shitty
little Mafia hoodlum

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.639
how much he wants for the hotel

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.029
and say "yes" on the condition
he's out by Thursday.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.152
There is no need for you
or anyone else to see me.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.834
Howard. I feel I must advise you

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.593
that you can still be made
to be seen in court

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.238
in order to defend against charges

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.799
that you mismanaged TWA.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.056
That's not true. That's not true.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.593
I'm also finding it very difficult

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.159
to run your entire operation

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.755
when I've never, ever
actually seen you.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840
I mean, in the flesh.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.677
Do you realize that, Howard?

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.352
That I've never actually seen you?

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.868
Howard?

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.354
Bob? If you were
to actually see me

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:08.513
you could not represent me
in the way that I need to be.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.035
You are my chief executive officer,

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.792
you are not my father.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.155
Okay, what's this?

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.216
It's Stouffer frozen
turkey dinner, sir.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.595
Okay, well, I want you to
notify the Stouffer company

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.511
to remove the dark meat of the turkey

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.158
from the turkey frozen dinner.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.416
- Banana nut?
- Banana nut, sir.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.475
Forget banana nut!

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.359
Okay. Levar!

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.908
No more banana nut ice cream.
You got that?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.831
No more banana nut ice cream.
From now on...

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.478
I want French vanilla.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.551
Goddamn it. I want French vanilla now.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.478
I want you to bring me
that schedule of Maheu's

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.874
because I wanna know exactly

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.536
what that son of a bitch is doing.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.518
Mr. Hughes,
Marla Mabrey has just come in.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.192
I put her in the speakerphone room.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.758
Shall I tell her
you're unavailable, sir?

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.077
Frank, handle this, will you?

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.315
Go talk to her.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.755
Tell her I'm just not seeing people.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.151
I want French vanilla from now on!

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.310
French vanilla immediately.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.310
Hi.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.152
What can I do for you?

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.670
It's my career, not yours.

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.228
And you can help by accepting that.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.356
It's really none of
your business, Frank.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.549
Okay.

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.789
But you can tell your boss

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.598
I feel it's only right
that I meet with him

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.591
before taking any action.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.428
I don't know. You never looked
at her screen test.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.750
She might have someone new
who's advising her.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.717
Who? An agent? Lawyer? What?

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.456
Have you heard she might be
involved with somebody?

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.550
I've heard nothing! I...

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.029
Never mind. You go ahead.
I'll talk to her.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.920
Yes, sir.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.392
Marla?
Are you, are you there, Marla?

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.635
Are you in the room?

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.233
I can't do this

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.475
on the telephone, Howard.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.754
I'm not seeing people.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.080
Something we didn't plan on
has happened.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.752
You better pick up the phone, Marla.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.398
We should have been more careful.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.440
From a single encounter,
Marla? From one time?

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.317
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:44.990
I'm surprised.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.880
I didn't think you were
that kind of a person.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.910
How much money are you looking for?

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.376
Hey, is vanilla and French vanilla,
is it the same thing?

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.080
Yes, it's the same?
I'm gonna go check on it.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.315
You're acting crazy.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.336
I know more about the business
than you think I do.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.016
Oh, all those big deals
in your future, Frank?

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.096
You better get them in writing.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.216
I don't need them in writing.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.037
Well, that's right.
'Cause you trust him.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.696
He won't even meet with his wife.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.336
- Lucky woman.
- He won't let anybody look at him.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.456
- Oh, well, he's right!
- There's no reason...

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.576
He's right. Because they might see
exactly what he is,

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.556
a cold, sleazy, egomaniacal, old fake

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.789
not worth meeting with.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.229
You wanna have meetings
or make movies?

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.880
They got names for guys that are doing
what you're doing, Frank.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.513
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.676
I think I'm talking to
somebody that sold out

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.520
and you can tell the guy
that you sold out to

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.516
that I'm never going back
to that stupid house!

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.976
And he can throw
whatever's in it away.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.576
And that you wanna go home
to your fiancée

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.953
and get legally married!

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.736
Do you actually think that you're
going somewhere with Howard Hughes?

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.796
You're even scared
to get on his plane!

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.269
- Okay, just...
- Don't be physical with me, Frank!

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.976
Whoever the hell
is advising you right now...

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.560
You know, it's none of your business
who's advising me now!

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.551
You need someone
who's advising you now!

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.870
To move on, Frank, move on! I have!

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.536
- Do you mind if I speak?
- Get out of here!

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.120
No, because there's
nothing left to say!

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.912
And if you call me,
I won't talk to you.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.911
So kindly treat
my privacy with respect!

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Respect?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.917
Go back to your goddamn mystery man,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.877
with your privacy and your rings

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.678
and don't worry about
me ever calling you.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.318
Believe me, I never will!

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.296
Nadine, who called
that Maheu didn't tell me about?

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.038
Today? The chairman of the FAA,

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.633
the Under Secretary of Defense,

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.676
the Treasury secretary,

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.456
someone from the air traffic
controller's union,

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.038
and a man from the AFL-CIO.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.509
All right, look, we're leaving
that son of a bitch Maheu

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.511
alone in Vegas tonight.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.034
Nobody tells him about it!
He's finished. He's fired!

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.473
We're going to Nicaragua.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.120
This isn't the only place
in the world without taxes!

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.519
Get me my pilot's jacket.

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.077
All right, come on, come on.
Let's go. Come on!

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.276
Going through the kitchen now.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.549
It's all up to me.
Nothing gets bought,

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.914
nothing gets sold without me.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.514
For all practical purposes,
I am Howard Hughes.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.736
Come on, Frank. Get outta the car.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.079
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160
Come on!

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.351
Frank, you can do this.
Come on. Flying can be fun.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.759
I think I'm ready.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.640
Okay, Cappy, it's about time
I did this again.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.232
Gentlemen, I am finally
gonna do something

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.675
that I haven't done for far too long.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.876
Far too long.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.509
Cappy, this is Frank here's
first plane ride.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.040
I wanna make it memorable.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.872
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.029
Here we go.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680
We got banana nut?

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.550
Have we...

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.517
- Uh...
- A pint and a half, sir.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.749
Pint and a half.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.229
Finally! It's been far too long!

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.231
Far too long.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.435
Spoons.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.800
President Somoza is coming aboard!

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.034
Mr. Hughes!

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.156
Welcome to Nicaragua.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.118
You look incredible!

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.997
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you. So do you.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.638
- You have not aged.
- Thank you.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.800
I wanna know
what you're doing in...

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.911
There's an important message for you.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.638
"The United States
Federal Court decided today...

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.116
"...in the case of TWA...

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.680
"...a judgment of $645 million

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.239
"against Howard Hughes...

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.393
"...who refused to appear."

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.437
This cannot be good.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.600
They think I'll have to sell

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.471
the Hughes Tool Company to pay it?

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.516
I'll never sell my daddy's company.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.192
My daddy would say it's time to call

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.759
Raymond Holliday down in Houston.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.239
Get him to come down here.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.760
So...

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.716
I just want you to know

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.870
I don't think you're doing
the wrong thing.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.273
And I am so relieved

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.555
that you're not
going back to Hollywood.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.393
Mom, I haven't told another
living soul about this.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.357
Doctor Diamond is a good man,

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.992
and he's coming in on a Sunday.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.834
So, shall we go?

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.110
Now, when you were 10 years old,

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.016
when you used to come down
to your daddy's factory...

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.076
Raymond, my daddy always trusted me

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.388
to take care of things.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.296
Now, trying to take care
of the Hughes Tool Company

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.230
at a time like this.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.016
That's like trying to
take care of my daddy.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.951
You're not your
daddy's father, Howard.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.234
Your daddy's dead.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
No, he's not.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.351
He's in my DNA.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.708
Oh, Lord!

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.480
You know, you're gonna die, too.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.677
Who you gonna leave it to?
Whose DNA you gonna be in?

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.398
In my opinion,
if you don't sign it now,

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.959
they're gonna do what they said.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.398
They're gonna withdraw the offer
to buy the damn company.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.191
So, if I sign this thing,
would they still keep

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.032
the Hughes name on the company?

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.554
You don't drill for oil
with a name, Howard.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.656
You know, I'm planning on
doing a little flyin'.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.908
Do you wanna come?

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.515
- Do a little flyin'?
- Hmm.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.468
What?

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.354
I'm just not sure...

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.954
...you ought to be thinkin'
about flyin' anymore, Howard.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.794
Come on in, Frank.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.394
Okay. Please give this
to the gentleman, and

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.357
tell him that I have asked him

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.556
to please consider

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.631
keeping my father's name
on the company.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.468
This is signed.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.256
Mr. Hughes has asked you
to consider keeping

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.838
his father's name on the company.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.360
I notice you don't say grace anymore.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.560
I don't mean to be negative,
but do we live

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.635
in Nicaragua now?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.912
Although, I am kinda getting
to like Managua.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.120
Wave, Frank.

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.515
Whoo. Let's keep it going.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.913
Don't worry, don't worry!

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.877
I know how to handle earthquakes!

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
We're going to London.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.520
Check out the tax setup,
Frank, and get me some codeine.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.376
The University of Virginia's
going coed.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.680
They're finally letting women in

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.478
so I might even go for a doctorate

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.959
and do my dissertation on music.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:11.870
Good for you.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.155
Thanks for not throwing
my things away, Nadine.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.071
I had no idea where to send them.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.720
Where do we call you in Virginia?

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.833
Maybe it's better if I call you.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.839
Therefore, the percentages noted

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.478
in the column were percentage of...

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.080
Frank, we've been
in London too long with no fun.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.469
I want you
at the Gatwick Airport in 45 minutes

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.551
in the DC-3.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.912
Give the man some credit.
He knows he can't fly.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.869
Mr. Hughes!

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.474
So happy to finally meet you
in person, sir. At last!

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.656
I'm sure you need
no introduction to the DC-3. This one,

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.510
of course, is equipped with

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.672
the Pratt & Whitney R-1830
Twin Wasp engines,

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.558
- which improve...
- I know the DC-3 very well.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.030
Um...

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.073
Certainly an improvement over the
original Cyclone 9s which were wanting

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.096
- in the old oomph department.
- Where to, gentlemen?

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.155
Where do we go?

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.113
I don't know, sir.
If we are heading east,

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.397
then that would be northern
France, possibly Belgium.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.550
What do you think,
wing commander? Belgian waffles?

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.789
How does it sound?

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.553
Uh, I don't know.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680
All right, never mind.
You want a chicken sandwich?

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.193
- Not hungry.
- Not hungry. Okay.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.080
How about you? Do you want
a chicken sandwich?

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.037
- No, thank you.
- I got three.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.872
- I'm fine. Just eaten.
- No?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.231
Did you know that
you're 20% less likely to black out

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.191
during a dive when you're my age?

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.675
Because the arteries
are less expansive.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.110
No, I didn't know it, sir.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.315
Remember that.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.118
- Something to look forward to.
- Yes!

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.553
Okay, let's go.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.478
I think we may have a door still open.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.518
Relax! I like it like that!
Just close the cockpit.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.351
Gentlemen, you ain't
seen nothin' yet.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.396
You know that line
Al Jolson used to use,

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.754
"You ain't heard nothin' yet"?

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.512
First time he ever sang it,
I saw him

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.119
upstairs on the roof

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.758
at the Amsterdam Theatre.
And it was

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.034
a big charity show.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.032
Everybody's big stars,
big stars, and Jolson says,

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.678
"I gotta close the show,

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.637
"because I'm the world's
greatest entertainer

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.029
"and nobody, but nobody,
follows Jolson."

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.519
Well, everybody said,

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.033
"Okay, Jolson, you're the greatest.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.269
"You close the show."

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.952
There was only one problem though.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.996
Jolson didn't know
who he was following.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.792
Caruso.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.792
He's gotta get up and sing
after Enrico Caruso,

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.075
the world's greatest voice! Ha!

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.230
So, Caruso comes out,
he's singing in Italian.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.878
The audience just goes crazy.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.136
They go crazy.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.912
They're on their feet cheering.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.558
They won't sit down,
they're cheering!

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.390
Caruso goes off,

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.356
Jolson comes out.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.760
But he can't get them to shut up,

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.153
because they want more Caruso.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.798
And finally Jolson shuts them up.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.110
He makes them sit down
and that's when he says it.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.636
He says, "You know,
you ain't heard nothing yet!"

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.856

Hey, Frank!

Flyin' really gives a guy a chance

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.696
to do some thinking, doesn't it?

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.199
You know what
I'm thinking, Frank?

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.555
I am thinking that
it's time for me to buy

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.675
Pan American Airlines!

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.512
You ain't heard nothin' yet!

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.834
Hey, where you goin'?
Come back here.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.480
Well, tell hotel security
to tell the mother...

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.480
Yes, there's three of them.
They're all up here.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.916
Go this way.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.956
I have no idea how they got in.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.352
Come on, kid. Please!

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.715
You gotta get out of here. Kid.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.030
I know where you are, kid.
Please come out.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.200
Please. Your mother
is waiting for you.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.880
Mr. Hughes!

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440
Mr. Hughes,

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.595
we have wonderful news!

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.319
The court of appeals
has reversed the TWA judgment.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.594
You get all the money back!

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.831
Levar! Are you actually
so bird-brained

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.056
you think I didn't know that?

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.559
I get up earlier than you do.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:56.675
Hey, look at you.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.800
- What's your name?
- Hi.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.216
- Tommy.
- Would you like some ice cream?

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.754
It'd be good for you!
Come on, let's go!

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.719
Come on, kid. We gotta go.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.816
But he might like some ice cream.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.159
Well, his mother is very upset.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.176
Why did you talk to his mother?
He might have wanted ice cream.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.536
Wait out in the hall or somethin'.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.039
Why did you talk to his mother?

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.111
I didn't talk to the mother.
I talked to security.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.480
You always say to keep kids out.

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.033
Why did you talk to security?

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.997
Because that's my job!

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.354
- That is your job?
- Yes!

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.656
You're telling me what your job is?

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.159
Yes! That is my job!

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.736
Your job is to tell me
what your job is!

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.637
- Are you deaf?
- What?

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.757
You are deaf. You're deaf!
And you're old.

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.592
You're very old,
and you're very deaf!

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.136
You calling me old and deaf?

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.515
You're deaf, and you're old!
And very deaf, and very old!

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:35.999
You do not know
what your job is.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.936
No, I know what my job is!
You do not know what my job is!

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.136
You don't know what your job is!

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:40.296
I know my job! I know my job!

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.736
- You know what your job is?
- I know what my job is!

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.795
You know, it's "was."

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:43.880
- Is.
- Was.

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.279
- Is. Is. Is.
- Was. Was.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.190
- Was?
- No, was.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.236
- Was?
- Was. That was your job.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.635
Get out.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.553
Sir, the mother's very upset.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.400
Get out.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.874
Take 14 days to make a decision
on Mulholland Canyon.

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.040
Levar and I are gonna do it
whether you do it or not.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.191
I know it's hard for you
to trust people,

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.511
but Levar is rooting for you
no matter how nutty you get.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.279
It would be a big advantage for us
to be in business with you,

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.960
but it might be a big advantage
for you to be in business with us.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.110
If you decide not to,

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.034
I can only respectfully
accept your decision and resign.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.350
Do you realize

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.432
that your drug addiction
not only makes you more constipated,

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.873
it makes you crazier?

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.474
But since no one who works
for you, including me,

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.118
will put their job on the line

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.395
to try to keep you
from killing yourself,

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.038
then maybe your wealth

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.236
isn't always the best thing
for your health.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.990
Frank, how come you never
talk about your daddy?

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:13.990
What?

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.231
You never talk about
your daddy. How come?

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.154
I could always tell my mother
how much I loved her, but I...

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.556
I couldn't tell my daddy
that well...

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.838
I don't know.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.794
But I miss my daddy.

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.237
I wish I could just talk to him.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.470
You know, I think I never had a kid

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.638
because I was afraid
that would make me feel old.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.231
Remember the night we went out to

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.108
sit and look at the plane,
and had the burgers, you know?

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.400
It was a hell of a hamburger.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.676
Do you still believe in

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.190
what the church tells you to believe,

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:52.869
like...

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.679
In heaven and...

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.397
I don't know, Mr. Hughes.

01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.708
Yeah, me either.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.428
I just...

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:13.235
I don't wanna do what a person
has to do to find out.

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.789
Um...

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.474
All right, look,
I'll do Mulholland Canyon with you.

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:21.757
And I'll do it big. But I just
got... Under one condition.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.595
From now on,

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.955
will you call me Howard?

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.314
Yeah!

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.320
We are standing by

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.992
for a telephone call from legendary

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.640
billionaire Howard Hughes,
which could debunk a writer's claim...

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.194
The writer that was mentioned
earlier, Richard Miskin,

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.816
claims to have had access
to Howard Hughes.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.976
And during that time, he says

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.376
that Hughes could not
remember anything,

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.277
was incoherent, and unable

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.395
to function.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.074
And that Hughes is in
a permanent state of dementia.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.077
The location of Howard Hughes

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.673
is still a complete mystery to us.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.536
It will be
a major problem for Hughes...

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.816
- Yeah.
- ...if he doesn't call us

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.512
as promised
by the Hughes organization,

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.238
and defend himself against

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.992
the charges in Miskin's book.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.150
One of
the pioneers who helped in...

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.070
Howard.

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.434
...was Howard Hughes.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.790
He's one of the most
influential individuals

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.711
of the last quarter century.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.598
Well, if she won't
even tell you her name...

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.376
Hughes was romantically linked

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.816
to several young actresses
over the years...

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.909
Yeah.

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.958
Okay.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.918
...manufactured
a 25 million dollar flying boat.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.576
Meanwhile,
we're told that the writer,

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.989
Richard Miskin,
may speak to us soon.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.350
She's okay, guys. I got this.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.237
These guys do their job.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.320
Yeah, well...

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.040
They're new.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.192
Why didn't you tell anybody
who you were?

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.976
Well, the last conversation
I had with Howard

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.149
wasn't very pleasant.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.629
I have something to tell him
before he talks to the press.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.669
Matt?

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.914
Matt, this is Levar.
Levar, this is Matt.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.594
- Hi.
- Hello, Matt.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.520
Hi.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.272
We have here the writer
of the book, Richard Miskin.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.318
Mr. Miskin, Hughes' people say
your book is a fake.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.517
That he has never met
or even spoken with you.

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.433
I don't think you'll
hear Mr. Hughes say that

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.999
or anything else much.

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.674
I don't think you're going
to be hearing from him.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.398
I doubt he even
remembers the book.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.038
Let me ask you again...

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:02.616
Sir, Howard Hughes
is a disturbed creature.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.073
And my heart goes out to him.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.720
But if it is upon
his flimsy recollection

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.836
that you're hinging your reportage,

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.633
then good luck to you.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.358
That's all I have to say.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.793
Good afternoon.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.677
Thank you, Mr. Miskin.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.273
And now back to you.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.193
Do we know what
qualified experts have to say

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.068
about the psychiatric
implications of Mr. Hughes',

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.469
uh, reclusive behavior?

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:28.736
One could speculate...

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.432
Howard.

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.656
...possibly catatonic at this point.

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.272
No one seems to know.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.776
That could have a bearing

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.268
on a lot of his business interests.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.238
It could affect his defense
contracts, for example.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.833
A long list,

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.456
including the Hughes
Medical Foundation, right?

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.856
The Hughes casino licenses

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.120
in Las Vegas could be affected.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.576
And if this call
does not come in soon...

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.158
All right.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.616
Helicopter
to the public and Air Force officers

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.551
at Culver City, California.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.076
Powered by turbojet motors,
the huge copter is designed

01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.993
primarily to lift great weights.
It is the largest aircraft

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.638
- of its kind known.
- Hi.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.119
And when perfected, it's expected

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.872
- to take off...
- Long time.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.376
...carry the load
of a small freight car.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.400
Yeah, long time.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.472
...upwards of a hundred persons.
The copter itself...

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.720
Hey, how about this guy, huh?

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.995
...pounds, and its
rotating blades measure...

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.433
Frank, this is my son, Matt.

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.590
...from tip to tip.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.516
Hi, Matt.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.669
Hi.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:21.816
Matt, when I first went to Hollywood,

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.896
Frank picked up your grandmother

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.035
and me at the plane.

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.440
...future of flight in all its varied
and promising phases.

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.160
What kind of ice cream
have we got, Levar?

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.555
I heard some talk about rum raisin.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640
Here, Matt, I'll show you

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.755
where the rum raisin is.

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.456
...phone call
from billionaire Howard Hughes.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.480
Have a seat there, guys.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.350
Okay.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.954
...a writer by
the name of Richard Miskin,

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.031
that Hughes is unable
to remember anything...

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160
I talked to Mamie Murphy.

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.111
She knows Richard Miskin.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.111
Howard may have
some questions.

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.416
...historical footage
featuring Howard Hughes's...

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.634
It's good to see you, Marla.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.256
...in aviation.

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.156
For me, too.

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:55.550
The 40-ton, 57 -passenger liner that...

01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:56.993
I'll let him know you're here.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.296
...which has made
a newtrans-continental,

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.038
non-stop speed record

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.079
Here's the start.

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.296
...what might be next
for the Hughes organization,

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.677
if Mr. Hughes never steps forward
to defend himself against the claims

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.079
in Mr. Miskin's book?

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.799
Howard, Marla Mabrey has come here.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.189
She says she has something
to tell you about Miskin.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.474
I told her I'd let you know.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.520
...certainly
going to be embarrassing

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.830
for Hughes and his entire empire.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:23.229
How does one explain away the fact

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.550
that the man can't even make
a simple telephone call?

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.789
Bring her in.

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.916
I suppose they could

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.838
still come out with some kind
of alternative evidence.

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.672
Struggling out of its
swaddling clothes.

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.513
And one of the pioneers who
helped was Howard Hughes,

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.000
still active in the industry today.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.196
As a stunt,
the point of aviation speed...

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.576
David,
I'm looking at the clock

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.080
and if the call doesn't come by 4:30,

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.639
then it will be hard to defend

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.154
Howard Hughes against the charges
in Richard Miskin's book.

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.240
Howard?

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.536
The clock is ticking, David.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.629
Hello, Marla.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.792
Any thoughts
as to what may happen...

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.880
We've lost touch.

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.279
I'm sorry I was in

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.113
such a bad mood
when you came to Las Vegas.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:04.673
When was that?

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.751
Five years ago?

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.832
I was not at my best.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.270
I know that, Howard.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.190
Neither was I.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.953
Mamie Murphy knows
Richard Miskin very well.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.554
She told me that she was
very sure he never met you.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.437
She'd testify
if you wanted her to.

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:21.776
...go a long way
towards debunking a writer's claim

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:24.030
that he has written an...

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.519
I came with my son.

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.912
And has now gone into
what could best be described as...

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.149
Excuse me?

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.559
I came with my son.

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.434
He's in the living room.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.476
And there's another point to be...

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.788
And the father?

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.359
...if Hughes does not

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.829
prove that he's still alive,
and there is some question

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.558
as to whether he is.

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.676
Just someone I took up with.
It didn't last long.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.796
The call was, incidentally,

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.074
supposed to come in at 4:00.

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.594
Would you like me to meet your son?

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:56.680
Sure.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:57.896
If that call were to come in

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.956
within the next several minutes...

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.554
Matt? You wanna meet Mr. Hughes?

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.313
...from New York
to New York in four days.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.356
New aviation history is written.

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.716
Howard Hughes
simply does not allow himself

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.279
to be seen by anyone.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.351
Howard, this is Matt.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.856
It'll be very,
very difficult to defend Howard Hughes

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:18.790
against the charges...

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.279
Say hello to Mr. Hughes, Matt.

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.150
Hello.

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.576
...covering him
for a long, long time. As have you.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.953
How old are you, Matt?

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:28.710
Four and a half.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.597
I'm curious
as to what's going to become

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.160
of the empire that he...

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.474
You look like I thought you'd look.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.673
So do you.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.120
Why do you stay in this room?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.560
You know, I really
should get out more.

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.351
Okay, Frank, get Hollywood
on the phone.

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.077
Nadine, get Los Angeles, fast.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.196
They're still on the line, Frank!

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.998
Get it, get it. I'm going to do this.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.149
Howard, you can just...

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.753
Frank, they're still on the line!

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.120
They're still on the line? Good.

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.312
Matt, you wanna stick around
for a while?

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:43.676
Frank, where do I put it?

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:45.915
- Do I pin this on?
- Yeah.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.752
That goes around my neck?

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.750
We are being told

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:55.673
we will hear from
Howard Hughes immediately.

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.352
We are standing by.

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.656
I think that's the man
I'm gonna be talking to,

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.033
- but we'll see...
- Frank!

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.795
This belongs to him. I'm sorry.

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.358
Matt, I'll wait for you
in the living room.

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.256
If you just joined us,

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.111
we're standing by for a phone call

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.872
from billionaire Howard Hughes.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.712
We've been told the call
is coming in...

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.096
I'm told
someone claiming to be Howard Hughes

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.678
will be speaking to us momentarily,

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.751
so we can assess whether he is indeed

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.512
Howard Hughes.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.477
Are you there, Mr. Hughes?

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.558
Good afternoon.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:32.856
Where are you speaking from, sir?

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.313
I'm speaking from Acapulco,

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.358
which is a city seaport
in the state of Guerrero

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:39.829
on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:43.469
About 190 miles southwest
of Mexico City,

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.030
located on a deep, semicircular bay.

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.376
I would say that the municipality

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.595
has an area of about

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.272
726.9

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.475
square miles and

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.791
it is the largest city
in the state. Far larger than

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:59.075
the state capital, Chilpancingo.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.549
The name Acapulco
comes from the Nahuatl

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.837
language. It means
"place of big reeds,"

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.069
and that is where I am.

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.151
Next question, please.

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.356
Gene Handsaker,
Associated Press. Tell us a little

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.634
about the H-One.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.438
Well, we first called it "The Racer."

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.159
It was designed by me in
conjunction with Dick Palmer.

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.117
We built it in a small building

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.873
of what has now become
the Lockheed terminal,

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.951
and that, by the way, Gene Handsaker,

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.996
is where you and I first met.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.310
This airplane had a metal fuselage

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:29.675
with butt joints of which
we were very proud.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:30.869
It had flush

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.758
rivets which later became
standard in the industry.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.068
It had a wooden wing

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:36.070
which, of course, did not

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.536
become standard,
but it was the only thing

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.709
at the time that had

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.519
the smooth surface
that we needed. As I say,

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.238
a single engine,

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.033
single-seat airplane,
a beautiful little thing.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.599
I still have it, actually,

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.716
out at the factory at Culver City.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.711
You should go out there
sometime, Gene,

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.519
and take a look at it.
Next question, please.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:58.430
Gladwin Hill,
for The New York Times.

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.511
How well I know you, Mr. Hughes.

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.879
How well do you know
the book's writer, Richard Miskin?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.558
I don't know him.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.915
I've never seen him.
I've never even heard of him

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.877
until two days ago.

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:13.030
Hi, Howard. Vernon Scott here.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.096
As soon as you started
to talk, I knew it was Howard Hughes.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.519
Did you really wear tennis shoes

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.352
with your tuxedo?

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.000
Yeah, well, they were shoes made of

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.389
sort of a non-strategic material.

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.034
Kind of a canvas or imitation leather.

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.111
I had a pair of these
that I liked very much.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.997
I would wear them, and then they...

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.856
Some people called them
tennis shoes, but I...

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.553
I don't think they had anything to do
with being on a tennis court.

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.416
Can I ask you
a couple of questions

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.476
relating to national security?

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.152
Oh, I don't think so.

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.153
You know, I don't care to appear
in public very often, but...

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.470
I really should get out more.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.309
But it has been a pleasure
speaking to you, gentlemen.

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.958
Any time. Good evening.

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.552
I think that concludes

01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.835
our press conference. Thank you,

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:01.194
Mr. Hughes.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:03.635
I think there's a publisher
with a problem on his hands.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.630
You were really good.

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.472
I have to go find my mom. Bye.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.788
Kid! Kid!

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.275
Kid?

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.856
Things are looking up, Frank.

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.711
You did good.

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.233
We're going back to Hollywood.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.276
I feel good!

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.936
I think it's time to go home!
You know...

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.109
Howard...

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.720
You've done a lot of great things,

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.560
and you've done a lot
of great things for me.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.596
I think it is time
for you to go home.

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.272
And I think it's time
for me to move on.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.558
What?

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.468
I'm quitting, Howard.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.194
Where'd they go?

01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:58.514
They kinda slipped out.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.399
Keep an eye on him, Levar.

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.352
Frank?

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.635
Frank?

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.160
You think it's time
we give it a try?

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.280
Let's get Matt.

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:51.676
Hey, you know what?
I got a really good idea!

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.189
What's in those bottles?

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.350
That's water.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.515
From Maine.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.355
Water.

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.389
From Maine.
