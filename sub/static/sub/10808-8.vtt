WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:06.062
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.625
(wind whistling)

01:31.392 --> 01:34.962
Oh, what a godforsaken night.

01:34.962 --> 01:38.499
The whole world is swirling
with snow ghosts.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.800
WOMAN:
Don't talk that way, Henry.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.368
You know it gets me nervous.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.570
It's snowing. That's all.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.540
Do you know what
this Pete Rose is worth, huh?

01:46.540 --> 01:50.010
Would you believe people
are waterskiing in Acapulco?

01:50.010 --> 01:51.879
Don't believe everything
you read.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.714
Do you think God gets involved

01:53.714 --> 01:56.050
in which people
get to own white yachts?

01:56.050 --> 01:57.584
(wind whistling)

01:57.584 --> 01:59.787
Listen to that.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.757
Are those voices from hell
or are those voices from hell?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.025
(Henry laughs)

02:05.025 --> 02:06.326
It's only the wind.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.486
Wind is wind.

02:08.529 --> 02:12.166
Where's Seymour?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.963
Seymour!

02:17.504 --> 02:20.441
Why are you yelling?

02:20.441 --> 02:23.110
It's Saturday night!

02:23.110 --> 02:24.244
When I was your age,

02:24.244 --> 02:25.946
that was prime hunting time!

02:25.946 --> 02:27.147
(chuckles)

02:27.147 --> 02:28.382
You wouldn't catch
Henry Strand home

02:28.382 --> 02:30.317
on a Saturday night,
no, sirree, Bob.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.086
Oh, this rooster was out
there crowing.

02:32.086 --> 02:34.354
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
(laughs)

02:34.354 --> 02:35.989
Leave Seymour alone.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.391
Why does he have to knit?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.959
Why do you collect pictures

02:38.959 --> 02:41.862
of people in dumb uniforms
holding bats?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.098
Seymour has homework to do.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.233
Why doesn't he do it
in his own room?

02:46.233 --> 02:48.836
Well, this is as much
Seymour's room as anybody's.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.572
I need a quiet house
to concentrate, Dad.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.707
Remind me to check
his birth certificate.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.538
Those aren't my genes talking.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.213
What a nasty thing to say
about your only son.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.048
Now, didn't he knit you
that lovely sweater?

03:01.048 --> 03:03.710
It's warm. I'm cold.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.055
-(Henry groans)
-0h, now calm down, Henry.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.623
You're always this way
between the football

03:09.623 --> 03:11.614
and baseball seasons.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.860
-|'m going to walk the dog.
-The dog is dead.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.531
lt died last month.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.701
Oh, Lord. I actually forgot.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.070
(wind whistling)

03:23.070 --> 03:24.505
My poor dog.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.273
SEYMOUR:
Our poor dog.

03:26.273 --> 03:29.076
The dog was community property.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.445
Maybe we should get a new dog.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.114
(scoffs)
Dog dies, get a new dog.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.415
(snaps fingers)
Just like that! Hmph!

03:35.415 --> 03:36.450
SEYMOUR:
If you ask me,

03:36.450 --> 03:38.085
I think it committed suicide.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.555
That dog led a marvelous life!

03:41.555 --> 03:42.923
Ch, of course it did.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.424
Seymour is only joking.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.794
I'm surprised
it didn't leave a note.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.396
Now, Seymour, stop baiting
your father like that.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.832
He only wants
what is best for us.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.834
(wind whistling)

03:53.834 --> 03:57.471
Ooh, that wind does sound nasty.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.673
Are you expecting a delivery?

03:59.673 --> 04:02.276
Yes, a Trim Track
exercise machine.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.644
HENRY:
| see something out there.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.812
Or somebody.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.213
SEYMOUR:
If they're kicking in unison,

04:06.213 --> 04:08.749
it's probably the Radio City
Music Hall Rockettes.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.218
WOMAN:
Hello?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.587
Don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.556
-Hear what?
-Listen.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.357
(wind whistling)

04:17.357 --> 04:19.459
There is something.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.448
(knocking on door)

04:22.496 --> 04:23.997
I've heard about this.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.732
They say their car broke down

04:25.732 --> 04:27.167
and they want
to use the phone.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.836
Then you let them in
and then they murder you!

04:28.836 --> 04:31.572
-(knocking on door)
-Henry, call the police.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.141
And tell them what?
Somebody's knocking on our door?

04:34.141 --> 04:35.342
Well, what are we going to do?

04:35.342 --> 04:36.677
Well, we just can't
leave people

04:36.677 --> 04:38.478
out in the subzero cold.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.647
(shushing)

04:40.647 --> 04:43.984
If we're quiet,
maybe they'll go away.

04:43.984 --> 04:48.478
Unless they can smell warm blood
through aluminum siding.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.660
I'll see who it is.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.651
Use your strong voice.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.199
(deep voice):
Who's out there?

04:59.199 --> 05:01.602
WOMAN:
Open, please.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.270
It's a woman.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.261
They use women for bait.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.865
I'll keep the chain on.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.877
Yes?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.615
(Henry yelps)

05:33.267 --> 05:35.102
My floor-- | just had it waxed.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.772
Thousands of pardons, but snow
on the floor is good luck.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.843
Look, if you two have come here
to sell us something...

05:42.843 --> 05:46.113
(chuckles) well, I can tell you
right now, we're not buying.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.382
I assure you, we sell nothing.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.218
I suppose we should have called
before dropping in,

05:51.218 --> 05:52.853
but we were so eager to...

05:52.853 --> 05:54.184
Called? Why?

05:55.188 --> 05:58.392
What a lovely room!

05:58.392 --> 06:01.595
Oh! Well... thank you
ever so much.

06:01.595 --> 06:06.133
And a fortunate house to have
such a charming mistress.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.567
Aw...

06:07.567 --> 06:09.236
Would you like a cup of tea?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.404
Tea?!

06:10.404 --> 06:13.473
Of course,
the mandatory cup of tea.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.310
Now, where is the one
with the look

06:16.310 --> 06:18.245
of a thousand vacant meadows?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.414
You mean Seymour?

06:20.414 --> 06:23.250
Uh, he was here a minute ago.
Seymour!

06:23.250 --> 06:25.085
SEYMOUR:
What?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.520
Come down here.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.956
We have company.
It's not polite.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.058
MAN (gasps):
The child!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.389
(gong sounds)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.167
Who put you up to this?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.702
What an oversight.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.870
Allow me to introduce myself.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.974
lam Chai Fung,
ambassador without portfolio,

06:46.974 --> 06:49.743
from the ancient kingdom
of L0 Poa.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.178
This is my associate,

06:51.178 --> 06:54.581
our minister of the interior,
Madame Wu.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.650
Wu.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.986
FUNG:
She is overwrought.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.822
We spent last night
at the Holiday Inn.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.124
It was so hot,
we had to open the windows,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.460
but the windows don't open.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.829
There was glass everywhere.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.164
Uh, I'm Henry Strand.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.533
This is my wife Ellen.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.204
And, uh, you seem
to know Seymour.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.273
Only by visions.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.876
I'll get that
mandatory cup of tea.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.179
-Uh...
-Enough of the amenities.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.614
Time for business.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.316
We want your son.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.484
You want what?

07:30.484 --> 07:33.420
We must have the boy.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.490
(kissing continues)

07:36.490 --> 07:38.117
Stop it, you two!

07:39.860 --> 07:43.091
Do you mind if! sit?

07:44.731 --> 07:46.666
Does this throne
vibrate joyously

07:46.666 --> 07:48.135
upon the insertion of a quarter?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.303
What? Oh, sorry, no, no.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.805
No matter.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.308
The truest vibrations
of pleasure come from the heart.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.745
Oh, what a nice way to put it.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.080
On the other hand,

08:00.080 --> 08:03.150
the vibrations that can come
from a coin can be...

08:03.150 --> 08:04.217
SEYMOUR:
Awesome!

08:04.217 --> 08:06.686
The lad is quick-- very witty.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.055
HENRY:
What you said just now

08:08.055 --> 08:09.623
about, uh, wanting our son...

08:09.623 --> 08:11.058
ELLEN:
There must be some mistake.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.859
Nobody wants Seymour.

08:12.859 --> 08:13.860
Ma!

08:13.860 --> 08:16.329
I mean, he's a late bloomer.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.660
Like his father.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.123
But he knits beautifully.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.770
What do you want him for?

08:23.770 --> 08:25.272
Somebody need a transplant?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.440
(laughter)

08:26.440 --> 08:28.075
Dad!

08:28.075 --> 08:30.277
Nothing like the warmth
of a close-knit family,

08:30.277 --> 08:33.080
ifl may venture a pun.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.082
But enough humor.

08:35.082 --> 08:39.419
As you may know, last month,
our supreme lama,

08:39.419 --> 08:42.689
Hsi Shu'sha went to his reward

08:42.689 --> 08:45.792
when the Moon touched the tip
of the sacred mountain.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.929
He was in his hundredth year,
give or take.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.465
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.966
In the Year of the Frog,

08:52.966 --> 08:56.069
which is the 12,000th
anniversary of our country,

08:56.069 --> 09:00.307
the great Hsi Shu'sha nodded off
into infinite slumber.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.409
Those of us who remained

09:02.409 --> 09:04.945
were called upon to follow
the sacred rites

09:04.945 --> 09:06.847
to search for his successor.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.482
We read the stars,

09:08.482 --> 09:10.817
consulted our books
of parchment,

09:10.817 --> 09:13.620
drank the pollen of the daisies
that grow sideways

09:13.620 --> 09:15.489
and remained pleasantly dizzy

09:15.489 --> 09:17.090
for many weeks.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.092
The Moon, the birds,

09:19.092 --> 09:21.428
all earthly music
pointed us here

09:21.428 --> 09:23.396
to this endless
prairie of houses

09:23.396 --> 09:25.799
whose levels are split,

09:25.799 --> 09:27.501
and, finally, to this house--

09:27.501 --> 09:31.138
the home of our revered
and holy new lama.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.073
(gong sounds)

09:33.073 --> 09:34.563
Seymour?!

09:36.276 --> 09:38.612
(g uffawing)

09:38.612 --> 09:41.815
Seymourlama?!

09:41.815 --> 09:43.476
(Henry continues laughing)

09:45.085 --> 09:47.687
(Henry shudders)

09:47.687 --> 09:50.824
Sir, if you laugh,

09:50.824 --> 09:53.093
I will be forced,
by tradition,

09:53.093 --> 09:57.764
to eviscerate you and feed
your entrails to a mongoose.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.933
Wh-Who-Who's laughing?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.601
And now, for the presentation
of gifts.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.036
-ELLEN: Gifts?
-(gong sounds)

10:03.036 --> 10:04.204
Madame Wu.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.473
(Fung speaks native language)

10:06.473 --> 10:07.607
Carried across the continents,

10:07.607 --> 10:11.344
priceless treasures
from our country

10:11.344 --> 10:14.014
for the fortunate parents
of the Chosen One.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.383
ELLEN:
Oh, I love surprises.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.051
FUNG: Yak droppings
from the privileged yaks

10:18.051 --> 10:21.121
who graze on the north slope
of the glorious mountain.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.191
It's not Everest,
but we like it.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.394
You... really didn't have to.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.296
Our next gift.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.999
The final breath
of our former lama,

10:32.999 --> 10:36.536
zipped and saved

10:36.536 --> 10:38.505
-(bag pops open)
-especially for this occasion.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.273
Seals in freshness.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.841
I knew you'd like it.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.578
Rice from the first crop

10:44.578 --> 10:48.207
following Hsi Shu'sha's
journey to the stars.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.584
Holy book?

10:50.584 --> 10:53.086
Recipes for the rice.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.078
And now, for the anticlimax.

11:04.864 --> 11:05.853
(lid creaks open)

11:09.236 --> 11:10.604
Are these real?

11:10.604 --> 11:13.406
I assure you, they are.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.041
HENRY:
Diamonds.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.611
Amethysts. Pearls.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.479
FUNG:
Mere tokens.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.348
Hints of things to come.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.050
-Huh?
-At our Iama's coronation,

11:24.050 --> 11:26.086
we go the whole way.

11:26.086 --> 11:30.190
Naturally, you and your husband
will be our honored guests.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.627
Lo Poa will be yours.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.328
Lo Poa.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.130
You know,
we had that in Geography.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.331
It's near Tibet.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.100
Nothing like Tibet.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.536
They're Reformed.
We are Orthodox.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.235
Mr. Fung?

11:47.307 --> 11:48.675
Do you honestly think

11:48.675 --> 11:51.911
that we would trade our only son
for a few trinkets?

11:51.911 --> 11:55.448
Condemn him to an austere life
of snow and ice?

11:55.448 --> 11:58.285
A life without... culture?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.453
No, I don't think so.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.922
FUNG:
As progenitors of our lama--

12:02.922 --> 12:04.991
the source of the source,
if you will--

12:04.991 --> 12:08.128
you and your mate will be
dressed in silk and satin,

12:08.128 --> 12:11.064
bathed in the purest yak milk,

12:11.064 --> 12:13.466
given your weight
in precious stones,

12:13.466 --> 12:18.405
entitled to a ten percent
discount at the bazaars.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.906
(Seymour clears throat,
laughs anxiously)

12:19.906 --> 12:22.075
Uh, what about me?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.044
You?

12:24.044 --> 12:27.314
You, Seymour, will be hailed
as our heavenly leader.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.617
Your every need will be
anticipated and gratified.

12:30.617 --> 12:35.121
Your every utterance will be
inscribed by virgin scribes.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.756
Virgin scribes?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.526
And of course,
you will have the honor

12:39.526 --> 12:42.262
of eating the bark
of a sacred bung tree

12:42.262 --> 12:44.164
and regurgitating
into the crater

12:44.164 --> 12:45.999
of our world-class volcano.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.634
Whoa, wait a second.
Look, uh...

12:47.634 --> 12:49.336
You can just forget it, okay?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.971
HENRY: Uh, uh, Seymour makes
impulsive decisions.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.341
-He's just a kid.
-FUNG: Of course.

12:54.341 --> 12:58.211
Madame Wu, time for the Dance
of the Stubborn Adolescent.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.202
(Fung speaks native language)
...go, run.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.957
Our weight in jewels!

13:10.957 --> 13:15.161
Silk, satins, yak baths...

13:15.161 --> 13:18.098
Discounts at bazaars.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.767
Oh... I don't know if it's
the right thing for Seymour.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.169
SEYMOUR:
Do you want to go upstairs

13:23.169 --> 13:25.160
and check out
my Beatles records?

13:29.075 --> 13:31.811
Do you think
he should be alone with...

13:31.811 --> 13:33.480
Sign here

13:33.480 --> 13:38.151
and make your son
the next lama of L0 Poa.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.619
-(Seymour laughs in distance)
-Henry, Seymour isn't ready

13:39.619 --> 13:41.454
for a serious relationship.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.655
I really don't think...

13:42.655 --> 13:46.593
-(Madame Wu laughing)
-Think of a deep, dark,

13:46.593 --> 13:49.629
"Lo Pee" mountain tan.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.899
Sign here, Mrs. Strand.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.468
Now, come on, Seymour.
Act your age!

13:55.468 --> 13:57.629
(Madame Wu moans
passionately)

14:01.174 --> 14:03.143
(gong sounds)

14:03.143 --> 14:05.134
HENRY:
Way to go, tiger!

14:06.479 --> 14:09.549
And you said the hospital
must've switched babies.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.584
-HENRY: Ellen...
-ELLEN (muffled): Yeah?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.853
I told you he had strong genes.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.189
FUNG:
Now, splendid Seymourlama,

14:16.189 --> 14:19.192
we must discuss
your sacred duties.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.662
You will fly first class
on L0 Poa Airlines

14:22.662 --> 14:26.533
to the capital city of Platt
for seven glorious days

14:26.533 --> 14:29.969
and six unforgettable nights
of coronation excitement.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.939
A multitude of handmaidens
will carry you

14:32.939 --> 14:35.508
to the flaming crater
of Mount Kong.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.643
(glass shatters)

14:36.643 --> 14:38.378
Look, could we skip
the spiritual stuff?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.313
You were lucky enough
to find me.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.648
Who needs a coronation?

14:41.648 --> 14:44.117
It's for your people,
Your Generosity.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.985
They don't get
much entertainment.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.354
(sighs)

14:48.354 --> 14:51.624
Seymourlama desires a Twinkie.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.760
(wind whistling)

14:53.760 --> 14:55.094
(door opens)

14:55.094 --> 14:57.764
You don't get something
for nothing in this world.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.466
No even in "La Pee."

14:59.466 --> 15:01.734
Ah, words of wisdom

15:01.734 --> 15:04.370
from the person
who claims to be my father.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.073
Unfortunately,
I have papers to prove it.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.742
You're being obnoxious.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.678
I have the right
to be obnoxious.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.980
Actually, he is correct.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.182
It goes with the territory.

15:16.182 --> 15:19.049
I'm feeling
a little tension.

15:23.189 --> 15:28.561
Listen, I'll do the coronation
routine under one condition.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.065
Name it, oh, Brilliant Light
in the Dismal Forest.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.268
I want the palace of "Ly Poa"
wired for sound and cable.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.571
-Wired? What is...?
-Stereo.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.841
Quad sound. Television.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.910
FUNG:
But, Seymourlama, our mountains

15:43.910 --> 15:45.612
have the best acoustics
in the Himalayas.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.947
And we do not watch television.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.617
We watch the seasons
go into repeats.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.585
Are you arguing with me?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.287
Would I dare?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.688
Okay, it's settled.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.590
I'll go to the big party.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.526
Thank you, thank you.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.462
-(cracking)
-Ow! Easy! That hurt!

16:02.462 --> 16:03.730
MADAME WU:
Oh!

16:03.730 --> 16:05.532
What is she doing?

16:05.532 --> 16:08.868
Punishing the hand that damaged
the inspired one.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.436
Whoa, whoa!
Look... Look, just stop her,

16:10.436 --> 16:12.372
because she's going to get
blood all over my wool.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.241
(Fung speaks native language)

16:15.241 --> 16:17.243
(Wu wails)

16:17.243 --> 16:19.779
She must atone in some way.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.381
Heh. Good.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.383
You see those baseball cards?

16:23.383 --> 16:27.086
Find Willie Mays.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.680
And eat it.

16:31.758 --> 16:35.762
But that...
that's one of my favorite.

16:35.762 --> 16:39.198
I'm beginning to enjoy this.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.401
FUNG:
And it does our hearts good

16:41.401 --> 16:43.670
to see you in ecstasy, master.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.905
Uh, take a proclamation.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.607
Plug up the volcano.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.908
Do what?!

16:48.908 --> 16:50.376
(chuckles)

16:50.376 --> 16:53.179
And, uh, before you cap
the volcano,

16:53.179 --> 16:56.583
one final sacrifice.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.750
(gong sounds)

16:57.750 --> 16:58.944
No.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.710
Not your own father.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.961
SEYMOUR:
Not him--

17:07.961 --> 17:09.996
his baseball cards.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.366
Every last one of them.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.201
Zap.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.395
(gasps)

17:21.274 --> 17:23.509
Henry can't live
without his collection.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.378
Aw.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.615
I'm afraid all requests made
by our leader are final.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.352
Well, I'm a leader's mother and
I'm telling him to back off.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.149
You were my mother.
No more.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.124
Did you people ever consider
democracy?

17:38.124 --> 17:39.359
Not until we met him.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.195
Oh, forgive my entrails.
What am I saying.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.856
Make me a lap.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.844
(sighs)

17:57.844 --> 18:00.380
He looks so peaceful.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.507
Rest well, noble thing.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.319
I had better call home
and tell the prime minister

18:06.319 --> 18:08.048
we have found our new lama.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.651
We could still make
the 11:00 news.

18:14.994 --> 18:18.264
I, uh, assume
you're calling Lo Poa.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.033
Of course-- collect.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.797
Talk about long distance.

18:26.172 --> 18:30.543
Operator, sincere greetings.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.980
I would like the area code
for L0 Poa.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.683
No, it isn't a suburb.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.551
East.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.821
Further. More.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.189
That's it.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.059
Now, I would like to make
a person-to-person call

18:46.059 --> 18:47.960
to the exalted Pahn Dak.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.228
Collect?

18:49.228 --> 18:50.329
FUNG:
Collect.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.364
This number--

18:51.364 --> 18:58.905
716-555-0887.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.809
The name of Henry Strand.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.912
255 Daffodil Lane.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.580
Excuse me.

19:07.580 --> 19:11.050
-254 Daffodil Lane.
-Ah.

19:11.050 --> 19:15.955
Excuse me. 254 Daffodil...

19:15.955 --> 19:19.058
Never mind.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.427
Excuse me, Mother of Greatness,

19:21.427 --> 19:24.997
but isn't this
255 Daffodil Lane?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.933
I ought to know where I live.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.403
2-5-4.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.905
(speaks native language)

19:32.905 --> 19:35.608
No 55, 54.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.597
Oh, shoot.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.081
I... I don't know how
to tell you this.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.117
I hope it's not
an inconvenience.

19:44.117 --> 19:45.418
Tell us what?

19:45.418 --> 19:47.787
Hey, hey, wrong house.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.618
MADAME WU:
Oops.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.192
(stammering)

19:53.192 --> 19:55.361
But I-I have a parchment.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.597
A contract.
I know my rights.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.365
FUNG:
I'm very sorry.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.060
-Wait...
-No.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.804
Please, please...

20:04.804 --> 20:07.940
No, you-you, what...?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.943
That's our material!

20:10.943 --> 20:12.578
(Henry and Ellen
stammering anxiously)

20:12.578 --> 20:15.114
We spent two years
looking for sizes!

20:15.114 --> 20:17.550
HENRY:
We can work something out!

20:17.550 --> 20:19.886
Good night. Thank you
for seeing us to the door.

20:19.886 --> 20:24.118
(wind whistling)

20:35.868 --> 20:38.671
(Seymour yawning)

20:38.671 --> 20:44.644
Seymourlama's waking from his
restful, refreshing sleep.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.813
Seymour's hungry.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.115
Seymourlama desires
a hamburger,

20:49.115 --> 20:53.252
fries, onion rings, ketchup.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.721
(claps hands)
Now!

20:55.721 --> 20:57.924
Get me my food!

20:57.924 --> 21:00.626
Bring me my... whoa.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.128
Get-Get me my...

21:02.128 --> 21:03.796
ELLEN:
ls his insurance paid up?

21:03.796 --> 21:08.665
HENRY: He's got two, three weeks
of intensive care.

21:19.579 --> 21:23.382
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.918
Waiting for us to enter.

21:25.918 --> 21:29.155
Waiting to enter us.

21:29.155 --> 21:35.355
Until next time,
try to enjoy the daylight.
