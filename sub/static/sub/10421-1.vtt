to look for Cath.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.488
But she was gone.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.832
If you last a year and a half
on that street, you're lucky.

Her name's Cathy.

- Uh-huh.
- She's a Londoner.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.945

on her hand, there.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.826

36:02.910 --> 36:04.828
Things can happen out there.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.830
Out where?

36:06.914 --> 36:11.042
On the streets, in the clubs.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.421
I can't go down, but you could.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.844
I'll pay you.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.014
- How?
- Any way I can.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.270
I want to find her.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.814
You know the way it is.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.359
Yeah.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.741
You're a good man, Mr. George.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.830
How can you tell?

36:52.293 --> 36:55.128
I can tell.

- Promise?
- I promise.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.096
Good night, Mr. George.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.309
Good night.

Thanks for the drink.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.086
Put the light out.

37:37.713 --> 37:40.590
- What do you reckon?
- What happened to the spaghetti?

37:40.675 --> 37:43.635
- Went like hot cakes.
- What are you gonna do with them?

37:43.719 --> 37:46.012
I'm working on that.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.348
- You're mad.
- You think so?

37:48.391 --> 37:50.809
Course not.

37:50.893 --> 37:53.853
Christ!

37:53.896 --> 37:56.189
What's happened
to you, George?

37:56.274 --> 37:58.191
I've grown up, Thomas.

37:58.276 --> 38:02.904
- Time to look like other people.
- You'll never look like other people, George.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.906
Fuck. Is that true?

38:06.242 --> 38:08.868
- Well, she don't think so.
- Aye? What's she up to?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.912
She's not up to anything.
She's a friend of mine.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.498
She's gotta be up to something, George.
What do you think this lot costs?

38:13.582 --> 38:16.334
Well, she's a woman of substance.
She's a lady.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.378
I thought you said
she was a tart.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.298
- Tall, thin, black tart.
- Well, maybe,

38:21.382 --> 38:23.758
but she's still a fuckin' lady.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.223
Sorry about the language.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.773

- Come on.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.528

- They friends of yours?

- Sort of.
- Come on. Get in.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.587

that day, Dad.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.922
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.051
- So you should be.
- What'd your mum say?

39:06.135 --> 39:10.055

- Never?

39:10.139 --> 39:12.432

39:12.475 --> 39:14.434

- No.

tell you either.

- Well, he goes back to the psychiatrist's office.

- What, the horse did the murder?

49:17.120 --> 49:20.081
- Murdered the lawyer's wife?
- Not the fucking lawyer's wife. The horse.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.375

51:20.535 --> 51:22.703
You get confused,
and always with the little things.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.705
- You know the little things.
- What little things?

51:24.790 --> 51:26.874
Do you or do you not
get confused?

51:26.958 --> 51:29.335
- Yeah, I get confused.
- You still get confused.

51:29.377 --> 51:31.837
- Yes, I get confused.
- Great. Well, at least now you know.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.215
- You do know it, don't you, George?
- All right, now I know.

51:34.299 --> 51:38.260
Well, that's something because...
Do you know what I'm good at, George?

51:38.345 --> 51:40.805
- What?
- I'm good at the little things.

51:40.889 --> 51:43.557
The little things
that mean everything.

51:43.642 --> 51:46.477
The things that you forget, George.

51:46.561 --> 51:49.146
I've got a family of me own now,

51:49.231 --> 51:51.607
and it's all perfectly legal,

51:51.691 --> 51:54.527
and it's all through the little things.

51:54.569 --> 51:56.946
And you're part
of that family, George.

51:57.030 --> 51:59.490
One of my favourite parts.

51:59.574 --> 52:03.786
- I'm glad, Denny.
- I'm happy that you're glad, George.

52:03.870 --> 52:08.040
- Want another drink?
- No. So, what's it all about?

52:08.125 --> 52:12.711
- What am I doing here?
- You're being happy. That's what it's all about.

52:12.796 --> 52:17.883
You come out.
I wasn't here. Now I'm here.

52:17.926 --> 52:22.096
- I want you to know that I know that.
- I know.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.849
- That girl who sees the Arab.
- Every night.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.685
You ask her what she does.

52:27.769 --> 52:30.604
- What do you mean, "what she does"?
- I mean what she does.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.690
What he pays her for.

52:32.774 --> 52:35.776
- Well, why me?
- Because you drive her, George.

52:35.819 --> 52:38.279
You should notice these things.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.281
The little things.

52:40.365 --> 52:43.033
The business is different,
but the rules are still the same.

52:43.118 --> 52:46.745
I mean,
I can't ask her that.

52:46.830 --> 52:51.083
She tells you, truthfully, mind.
That's important.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.795
You tell me,
and I'll be happy, George.

52:58.758 --> 53:00.718
You didn't like me, did you?

53:00.802 --> 53:02.761
- Well...
- Don't worry.

53:02.804 --> 53:06.223
Everyone hates me
once in a while.

53:06.308 --> 53:10.102
But it's important to me,
George, that you're happy.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.647
Well, I'm happy.

53:13.732 --> 53:16.984
Good. Good.

53:17.068 --> 53:19.612
(Man)
Okay, girls, now, a-one...

53:32.375 --> 53:34.335
You'd better go now.

53:34.419 --> 53:38.172
- Will you pick me up again?
- Your mum wouldn't like it.

53:38.256 --> 53:41.342
We can keep it a secret then
or something, all right?

53:41.426 --> 53:45.137
- (Chuckles)
- Promise?

53:46.181 --> 53:48.224
Maybe.

53:51.394 --> 53:53.312
Can you do tricks?

53:53.396 --> 53:55.814
What kind of tricks?

53:55.899 --> 53:59.610
I don't know. Any sort of tricks.
Dads are meant to do tricks, aren't they?

54:04.699 --> 54:08.494
- How about that?
- That's a good trick. See you later, Dad.

54:09.788 --> 54:11.705
Bye.

54:51.496 --> 54:53.998
Do you wanna do it
in the road or what?

54:54.082 --> 54:57.876
- You're out early.
- I do the rush hour.

55:06.928 --> 55:10.014
You. You told him, didn't you?

55:10.098 --> 55:12.474
- Told him what?
- You know what!

55:12.559 --> 55:15.728
You told him I was no fucking good,
that's what!

55:15.770 --> 55:19.231
- Bastard!
- Oi! Oi, come here!

55:19.274 --> 55:23.402
- Fuck off, you!
- But I didn't tell him.

55:23.486 --> 55:25.779
Why should I?

55:25.864 --> 55:28.198
Honestly!

55:28.283 --> 55:30.826
I said fuck off!

55:32.203 --> 55:37.541
Come here!
Listen. Come here!

55:37.625 --> 55:39.752
- Come here!
- Get off me, will you?

55:39.836 --> 55:43.339
Get off me!
What you want? Please!

55:43.423 --> 55:45.758
Shut up!
What did he do?

55:45.800 --> 55:48.218
What do you think
he fuckin' did? He...

55:48.303 --> 55:51.680
He beat me up
and he took all my stuff and...

55:51.765 --> 55:54.933
You told him, didn't you?
You fucking told him!

55:55.018 --> 55:58.520
- I told him I was happy, that's all.

56:35.725 --> 56:37.643

56:37.727 --> 56:40.687
Used to eat them all the time
when I was first down here.

56:40.772 --> 56:42.898
- Thought I was pregnant.
- Was ya?

56:42.982 --> 56:45.234

56:45.318 --> 56:47.736
How old are you?

56:47.821 --> 56:49.738
Seventeen.

56:49.823 --> 56:53.784
- You're not, are you?
- Well, what am I then?

56:53.868 --> 56:57.121
- You're fifteen, ain't ya?
- Okay, I'm fifteen.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.915

- And a half.

56:59.999 --> 57:03.168

- From a man like you.

57:03.253 --> 57:05.254

- No. I just want to talk.

57:14.514 --> 57:16.432
Well, how did you know

57:16.516 --> 57:18.434
I didn't know where to find you.
I wasn't looking for you.

57:18.518 --> 57:22.146
- I was looking for somebody else.
- That's not very nice, is it?

57:22.230 --> 57:25.065

57:33.533 --> 57:35.742

57:35.827 --> 57:38.704
You told me
your name was Cathy.

57:38.746 --> 57:42.583
Yeah, well, I'll say whatever
you want me to, don't I?

57:55.722 --> 57:59.975
Shut up. I only want to talk.

58:00.059 --> 58:02.519
Yeah, well, it all adds up,
doesn't it?

58:02.604 --> 58:06.773

you're taking up. It costs.

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:43.246
Now then, did you dance with him?
Did you waltz, eh?

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:45.290
Did you tango?

01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:49.628
Come on.
I'll buy you a present, eh?

01:31:50.796 --> 01:31:52.714
Let's have a party,
shall we?

01:31:52.798 --> 01:31:54.716
Here you are, mate.
(Laughing)

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:01.723
Don't run away.

01:32:01.807 --> 01:32:05.185
What you think?
Eh? Here.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:11.566
Beautiful. Cover those
fuckin' eyes, eh?

01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:13.568
Told you I was cheap,
didn't I?

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:17.197
Seven years away,
I can do with a tan.

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:19.407
- Don't run away from me.
- Leave me!

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:21.785
You got a tan.
Where'd you get your tan?

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:24.412
Can't I have a tan?
What's wrong with me?

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:27.249
(George) What's the matter?
Am I too old for you?

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:30.126
Am I too cheap?
Eh? You know.

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.420
Come on.
Just show me the sights.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.173
You know, get me some Brighton Rock.
That's all I want.

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.175
We're on holiday,
aren't we?

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.970
We're going to have fun, like men
and women do. They have fun.

01:32:40.012 --> 01:32:42.514
They walk arm in arm,
you know?

01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:45.183
- You know? And they all kiss.
- No.

01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:50.855
Because they love each other,

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.150
and they get married
so they can love each other more...

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.403
and have a little baby.

01:32:56.487 --> 01:32:58.446
Only a little one.

01:32:58.531 --> 01:33:01.449
And he fights with
his fuckin' mother-in-law.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:03.451
You know the way it is...

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:06.538
between men and fuckin' women!

01:33:06.622 --> 01:33:08.623
- Eh?
- (Whimpering)

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:10.834
Come on. Say something.
Anything. Say it.

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:14.838
(Whimpering)
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:17.757
- You're worried?
- Yes.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:19.926
So are you gonna tell me?

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:24.139
Tell you what?

01:33:24.223 --> 01:33:26.891
As my friend Thomas would say,
the whole story.

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:48.163
You like her, don't you?

01:33:48.247 --> 01:33:50.248
Of course I like her.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:53.877
Yeah, but you like her in that...

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:56.379
special way.

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:59.341
In the songs.

01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:01.885
What songs?

01:34:01.927 --> 01:34:04.262
Well, I've sold myself
for a couple of dykes.

01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:07.891
She needs me, George.

01:34:09.101 --> 01:34:11.728
And you needed me
to get her.

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.813
Did you ever need someone?

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:18.568
All the time.

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:33.583
George!

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.669
George!

01:35:17.169 --> 01:35:19.629
Hey, come on!

01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:29.139
Where the fuck is he?

01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:07.594
(Mortwell)
Shh.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.641
You bloody fool, George.

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:17.520
- You bloody fool.
- Can't you leave it, Denny?

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:21.149
No, George, I can't leave it at all.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.612
Can I, lovey?

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:30.825
Look at this tart.

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.497
What you do it for, George?

01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:38.249
- I mean, look at her. It's all right.
- (Gasps)

01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:42.045
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Your pimp will do that for me. See?

01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:45.423
I'm givin' 'em both back to you.

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:50.053
- The two of 'em.
- (Simone shrieks)

01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:51.971
Don't touch me! Don't!

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:54.307
- She's got a gun, George! Ahh!
- (Gunshot)

01:36:54.391 --> 01:36:57.644
- (Screaming)
- She blew me fuckin' toes off, George!

01:36:57.728 --> 01:36:59.687
- (Simone) It hurts now, doesn't it?
- George!

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:02.023
- (Gunshot)
- It really fuckin' hurts!

01:37:02.107 --> 01:37:03.900
- (Gunshot)
- (Cathy screaming)

01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:05.735
- Simone!
- (Cathy crying)

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:11.950
Hey!

01:37:18.415 --> 01:37:22.335
- Come on. Come on.
- What, hurt you too?

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:27.090
You fuckin' cow!
You fuckin' cow!

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:29.425
You would've done it,
wouldn't you?

01:37:29.468 --> 01:37:31.553
You would've done it!

01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:33.763
I'm just another
fuckin' punter to you!

01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:36.891
(Sobbing)

01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:44.107
You fuckin' cow.

01:37:49.488 --> 01:37:51.489
You fuckin'...

01:37:59.081 --> 01:38:01.207
(Sobbing)

01:38:24.356 --> 01:38:27.358
(Sobbing)

01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:24.999
(George)
She was trapped.

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:28.670
From the first time
he met her, she was trapped.

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:31.255
Like a bird in a cage.

01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.341
But he couldn't see it.

01:39:33.425 --> 01:39:36.010
Well, he liked her too much.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:39.097
And he was the sort who couldn't see
what was in front of his face,

01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:41.391
and there she was, in pain.

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:44.227
When you're soppy
about someone, well,

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.729
you can't see things
like that, can you?

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.774
And there he was,
soppy sod.

01:39:49.858 --> 01:39:51.901
Oh, she had faith in him.

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:55.238
She believed in him, and he
had a lot of hope for her.

01:39:57.449 --> 01:39:59.492
But then there was love.

01:40:00.703 --> 01:40:04.247
Yeah. Yeah, she was
in love, all right.

01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:06.582
- Uh-huh.
- She really was.

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:12.046
But not with him.
(Chuckles)

01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:14.966
- And that's the story.
- That's the whole story?

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:18.761
Well, almost.

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.931
- Hello, Dad.
- Comin'. Hello.

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:28.354
