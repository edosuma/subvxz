13:00.120 --> 13:03.329
for someone to have
an impulse to do something.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.688
Now, in a way that's - that's something
like a theatrical improvisation.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.764
I mean, you know, if you were a director
working on a play by Chekhov...

13:09.840 --> 13:13.083
you might have the actors playing
the mother, the son and the uncle...

13:13.160 --> 13:16.642
all sit around in a room and do
a made-up scene that isn't in the play.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.722
For instance, you might say to them...

13:18.800 --> 13:22.043
“All right. Let's say that it's a rainy
Sunday afternoon on Sorin's estate...

13:22.120 --> 13:24.361
and you're all trapped
in the drawing room together.”

13:24.440 --> 13:26.408
And then everyone would improvise -

13:26.480 --> 13:30.883
saying and doing what their character
might say and do in that circumstance.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.885
Except that in this type of improvisation -
the kind we did in Poland -

13:35.000 --> 13:37.844
the theme is oneself.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.406
So, you follow
the same law of improvisation...

13:40.480 --> 13:43.927
which is that you do whatever your impulse,
as the character, tells you to do...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.765
but in this case,
you are the character.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.242
<i>So there's no imaginary situation
to hide behind...</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:53.403
<i>and there's no other person
to hide behind.</i>

13:53.520 --> 13:56.410
What you're doing, in fact,
is you're asking those same questions...

13:56.520 --> 14:01.481
that Stanislavsky said the actor should
constantly ask himself as a character:

14:01.560 --> 14:05.087
Who am I? Why am I here?

14:05.160 --> 14:08.767
Where do I come from,
and where am I going?

14:08.840 --> 14:13.164
But instead of applying them to a role,
you apply them to yourself.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.481
- Hmm.
- Or, to look at it a little differently...

14:15.560 --> 14:17.608
in a way, it's like going
right back to childhood...

14:17.680 --> 14:20.650
where a group of children simply come
into a room or are brought into a room -

14:20.720 --> 14:23.007
without toys - and begin to play.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.801
Grown-ups were learning
how to play again.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.680
So, you would, uh,
all sit together somewhere...

14:30.760 --> 14:33.445
and, uh, you would play in some way.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.643
- But what would you actually do?
- Well, I could give you a good example.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.122
You see, we worked, uh, together
for a week in the city...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.248
before we went off to our forest.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.681
And of course,
Grotowski was there in the city too.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.525
I heard that every night,
he conducted something called a beehive.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.523
I loved the sound of this beehive...

14:49.600 --> 14:52.649
so a night or two before we were
supposed to go off to the country...

14:52.720 --> 14:55.803
I grabbed him by the collar, and I said,
“Listen, about this beehive.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.928
“You know, I'd kind of like
to participate in one.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.805
Just instinctively I feel it would
be something interesting.”

15:00.920 --> 15:03.924
And he said, “Well, certainly.
In fact, why don't you, with your group...

15:04.000 --> 15:06.606
lead the beehive
instead of participating in one?”

15:06.720 --> 15:10.611
You know, I - [ Laughing ] I got very nervous,
you know, and I said, “Well, what is a beehive?”

15:10.720 --> 15:13.371
He said, “Well, a beehive is...

15:13.440 --> 15:16.330
at 8:00 a hundred strangers
come into a room.”

15:17.320 --> 15:19.800
I said, “Yes?” He said,
“Yes, and whatever happens is a beehive.”

15:19.880 --> 15:23.089
I said, “Yes, but what am I supposed
to do?” He said, “That's up to you.”

15:23.160 --> 15:26.926
I said, “No, no. I really don't want to do this.
I'll just participate.”

15:27.000 --> 15:30.721
And he said,
“No, no. You lead the beehive.”

15:30.800 --> 15:32.848
Well, I was terrified, Wally.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.288
I mean, in a way, I felt on stage.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.681
<i>I did it anyway.</i>

15:39.760 --> 15:42.161
God. Well, tell me about it.

15:42.280 --> 15:46.330
<i>You see, there was this song
- I have a tape of it. I can play it for you one day.</i>

15:46.400 --> 15:49.609
And it's just unbelievably beautiful.

15:49.760 --> 15:54.482
You see, one of the women in our group knew a
few fragments of this song of Saint Francis...

15:54.560 --> 15:57.723
and it's a song in which you
thank God for your eyes...

15:57.800 --> 16:01.009
and you thank God for your heart,
and you thank God for your friends...

16:01.080 --> 16:03.048
and you thank God for your life.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.124
And it, uh - It repeats itself
over and over again.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.168
And this became our theme song.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.288
I really must play this thing
for you one day...

16:10.360 --> 16:14.763
because you just can't believe that a group
of people who don't know how to sing...

16:14.840 --> 16:18.561
could create something so beautiful.

16:18.640 --> 16:23.282
So, I decided that when the people
arrived for the beehive...

16:23.360 --> 16:26.170
that our group would already be there
singing this very beautiful song...

16:26.240 --> 16:30.086
and that we would simply sing it
over and over again.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.007
One of the people decided to bring
her very large teddy bear, you know.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.082
Well, she's a little afraid of this event.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.401
And somebody wanted
to bring a - a sheet.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.245
And somebody else wanted
to bring a large bowl of water...

16:42.320 --> 16:44.561
in case people got hot or thirsty.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.927
And somebody suggested
that we have candles -

16:47.000 --> 16:51.130
that there be no artificial light,
but candlelight.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.771
And I remember watching people
preparing for this evening.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.081
Of course, there was no makeup,
and there were no costumes...

16:56.200 --> 16:58.771
but it was exactly the way that people
prepare for a performance.

16:58.840 --> 17:02.049
You know, people sort of taking off
their jewelry and their watches...

17:02.120 --> 17:05.282
and stowing it away
and making sure it's all secure.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.284
And then slowly people arrived,
the way they would arrive at the theater -

17:08.359 --> 17:11.090
in ones and twos and 10s and 15s
and what have you.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.249
And we were just sitting there, and we
were singing this very beautiful song.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.688
And people started to sit with us
and started to learn the song.

17:17.760 --> 17:22.925
<i>Now, there is, of course,
as in any performance or improvisation...</i>

17:23.000 --> 17:25.480
instinct for when things
are gonna get boring.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.485
So, at a certain point - It may have taken
an hour to get there, an hour and a half-

17:29.560 --> 17:33.610
I suddenly grabbed this teddy bear
and threw it in the air...

17:33.680 --> 17:37.241
at which 140 or 130 people
suddenly exploded.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.324
You know, it was like
a - a Jackson Pollock painting, you know.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.803
Human beings exploded out of this tight
little circle that was singing the song.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.929
And before I knew it,
there were two circles, dancing, you know -

17:48.000 --> 17:51.322
one dancing clockwise,
the other dancing counterclockwise...

17:51.400 --> 17:53.562
with this rhythm
mostly from the waist down.

17:53.680 --> 17:58.049
In other words, like an American Indian
dance, with this thumping, persistent rhythm.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.408
<i>[ People Chuckling]</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:05.889
Now, you could easily see,
'cause we're talking about group trance...

18:06.000 --> 18:10.483
where the line between something like this and
something like Hitler's Nuremberg rallies...

18:10.560 --> 18:12.767
is, in a way, a very thin line.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.090
Anyway, after about an hour
of this wild, hypnotic dancing...

18:19.240 --> 18:22.449
Grotowski and I found ourselves sitting opposite
each other in the middle of this whole thing.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.966
And we threw the teddy bear
back and forth.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.606
You know, on one level,
you could say this is childish.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.967
And I gave the teddy bear suck,
suddenly, at my breast.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.203
And then I threw the teddy bear to him,
and he gave it suck at his breast.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.681
And then the teddy bear
was thrown up into the air again...

18:35.800 --> 18:39.088
at which there was another explosion
of form into... something.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.004
And these - What was it like?
You know, this is the -

18:42.080 --> 18:45.641
There's something like a kaleidoscope,
like a human kaleidoscope.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.009
The evening was made up
of shiftings of the kaleidoscope.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.082
Now, the only other things
that I remember...

18:52.160 --> 18:54.083
other than constantly trying
to guide this thing...

18:54.160 --> 18:58.722
which was always involved with either
movement, rhythm, repetition or song -

18:58.800 --> 19:00.928
Or chanting, because,
uh, two people in my group...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.120
had brought musical instruments,
a flute and a drum...

19:03.160 --> 19:05.128
which, of course,
are sacred instruments -

19:05.200 --> 19:07.726
was that sometimes the room
would break up...

19:07.800 --> 19:11.122
into six or seven different things
going on at once.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.124
You know, six or seven
different improvisations...

19:14.200 --> 19:18.046
all of which seemed, in some way,
related to each other.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.488
It was - It was like
a magnificent cobweb.

19:22.840 --> 19:27.004
And at one point, I noticed that Grotowski
was at the center of one group...

19:27.080 --> 19:29.924
huddled around a bunch of candles
that they'd gathered together.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.129
And like a little child
fascinated by fire...

19:33.200 --> 19:37.364
I saw that he had his hand right in
the flame and was holding it there.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.330
And as I approached his group,
I wondered if I could do it.

19:40.400 --> 19:45.281
I put my left hand in the flame and I found I
could hold it there for as long as I liked...

19:45.360 --> 19:47.761
and there was no burn
and no pain.

19:47.840 --> 19:52.004
But when I tried to put my right hand in the
flame, I couldn't hold it there for a second.

19:52.080 --> 19:57.007
So Grotowski said, “If it burns, try to
change some little thing in yourself.”

19:57.080 --> 20:00.562
And I tried to do that.
Didn't work.

20:00.640 --> 20:05.202
Then I remember a very, very beautiful
procession with the sheet...

20:05.280 --> 20:07.806
and there was somebody
being carried below the sheet.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.963
You know, the sheet was like
some great biblical canopy.

20:11.040 --> 20:15.204
And the entire group was weaving
around the room and chanting.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.365
And then at one point,
people were dancing...

20:19.440 --> 20:21.761
and I was dancing with a girl...

20:21.840 --> 20:24.411
and suddenly our hands began
vibrating near each other -

20:24.480 --> 20:26.403
like this - vibrating, vibrating.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.927
And we went down to our knees,
and suddenly I was sobbing in her arms...

20:30.040 --> 20:34.329
and she was sort of cradling me in her
arms, and then she started to cry too.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.801
And then we - then we just
hugged each other for a moment.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.208
And, uh, then we joined the dance again.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.807
And then at a certain point,
hours later...

20:43.880 --> 20:46.850
we returned to the singing
of the song of Saint Francis...

20:46.920 --> 20:49.287
and that was the end of the beehive.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.844
And then, again, when it was over, it was
just like the theater after a performance.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.129
You know, people sort of put on
their earrings and their Wristwatches...

20:58.200 --> 21:00.168
and we went off
to the rail road station...

21:00.240 --> 21:04.370
to drink a lot of beer
and have a good dinner.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.250
Oh, and there was one girl,
who wasn't in our group...

21:07.320 --> 21:10.767
but who just wouldn't leave,
so we took her along with us.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.569
[Chuckling ]

21:12.640 --> 21:14.608
Huh.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.241
God. Well, tell me some of the other things
you did with your group.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.041
<i>Well - Oh, I remember once
when we were in the city...</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:30.602
we tried doing an improvisation - you know,
the kind that I used to do in New York.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.081
Uh, everybody was supposed to be
on an airplane...

21:33.160 --> 21:35.970
and they've all learned from the pilot
there's something wrong with the motor.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.010
But what was unusual
about this improvisation...

21:39.080 --> 21:42.766
was that two people who
participated in it... fell in love.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.763
They've, in fact, married.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.571
And when we were -
Yeah, out of fear...

21:47.640 --> 21:50.883
of being on this plane,
they fell in love...

21:50.960 --> 21:53.088
thinking they were going to die
at any moment.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.801
And when we went to the forest,
these two disappeared...

21:56.880 --> 21:59.360
because they understood
the - the experiment so well...

21:59.440 --> 22:03.206
that they realized that to go off together
in the forest was much more important...

22:03.280 --> 22:06.762
than any kind of experiment
the group could do as a whole.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.128
So, uh, about halfway
through the week...

22:10.200 --> 22:12.407
we stumbled into
a clearing in the forest...

22:12.480 --> 22:15.927
and the two of them
were fast asleep in each other's arms.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.765
It was around dawn,
and we put flowers on them...

22:18.840 --> 22:21.969
to let them know we'd been there,
and then we crept away.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.362
And then on the last day of our stay
in the forest, these two showed up...

22:25.440 --> 22:28.330
and they shook me by my hands,
and they thanked me very much...

22:28.400 --> 22:31.131
for the wonderful work
they'd been able to do, you see.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.283
- [ Laughs]
- They understood what it was about.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.807
I mean, that, of course, poses
the question of what was it about.

22:39.160 --> 22:42.607
<i>But it has - has something
to do with living.</i>

22:45.320 --> 22:48.085
And then on the final day
of our stay in the forest...

22:48.160 --> 22:50.731
the whole group did something
so wonderful for me, Wally.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.041
They arranged a christening -
a baptism - for me.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.441
And they filled the castle with flowers.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.961
And it was just a miracle of light...

22:58.040 --> 23:01.931
because they had literally set up
hundreds of candles and torches.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.844
I mean, no church
could have looked more beautiful.

23:04.920 --> 23:08.049
There was a simple ceremony, and one
of them played the role of my godmother...

23:08.120 --> 23:10.122
and another played the role
of my godfather.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.881
And I was given a new name.
They called me Yendrush.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.407
And some of the people
took it completely seriously...

23:17.480 --> 23:19.642
and some of them found it funny.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.008
But, uh, I really felt
that I had a new name.

23:24.240 --> 23:28.006
And then we had an enormous feast,
with blueberries picked from the field...

23:28.080 --> 23:30.731
and chocolate someone
had gone a great distance to buy...

23:30.800 --> 23:32.848
and raspberry soup and rabbit stew.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.969
And we sang Polish songs
and Greek songs...

23:36.040 --> 23:38.964
and everybody danced
for the rest of the night.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.168
- Hmm.
- Oh, I have a picture.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.764
See, this was - Let's see.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.684
Oh, yeah.
This was me in the forest. See?

23:50.760 --> 23:53.445
- God!
- That's what I felt like.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.408
[Chuckling ]

23:56.480 --> 23:58.767
- That's the state I was in.
- God.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.651
Yeah. I remember George, uh, told me
he'd seen you around that time.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.041
He said you looked like
you'd come back from a war.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.522
Yeah, I remember meeting him. He, uh -
He asked me a lot of friendly questions.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.887
I think I called you up, too,
that summer, didn't I?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.883
Huh.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.964
I think I was out of town.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.726
<i>Yeah, well, most people I met thought
there was something wrong with me.</i>

24:20.800 --> 24:24.088
They didn't say that, but I could tell that
that was what they thought.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.288
But...

24:26.400 --> 24:31.088
you see, what I think
I experienced... was...

24:31.160 --> 24:33.925
for the first time in my life...

24:34.000 --> 24:36.526
to know what it means
to be truly alive.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.568
Now, that's very frightening...

24:38.640 --> 24:41.166
because with that comes
an immediate awareness of death...

24:41.240 --> 24:43.163
'cause they go hand in hand.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.687
You know, the kind of impulse that led to
Walt Whitman, that led to Leaves <i>of</i> Grass.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.240
That feeling of being connected
to everything...

24:49.320 --> 24:51.641
means to also be connected to death.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.922
And that's pretty scary.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.528
But I really felt as if I were floating
above the ground, not walking.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.246
You know, and I could do things
like go out to the highway...

25:01.320 --> 25:05.245
and watch the lights go from red to green
and think, “How wonderful.”

25:05.320 --> 25:08.642
- [Wally Chuckles ]
- And then one day, in the early fall...

25:08.720 --> 25:11.200
I was out in the country,
walking in a field...

25:11.320 --> 25:14.767
and I suddenly heard a voice
say, “Little Prince.”

25:14.840 --> 25:17.650
Of course, <i>The</i> Little <i>Prince</i>
was a book that I always thought of...

25:17.720 --> 25:19.643
as disgusting, childish treacle.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.008
But still, I thought, “Well, you know,
if a voice comes to me in a field” -

25:23.080 --> 25:25.401
This was the first voice I had ever heard.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.448
Maybe I should go and read the book.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.887
Now, that same morning
I'd got a letter...

25:29.960 --> 25:32.281
from a young woman
who'd been in my group in Poland.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.601
And in her letter she'd written,
“You have dominated me.”

25:34.720 --> 25:36.722
You know,
she spoke very awkward English.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.804
So she'd gone to the dictionary, and she'd
crossed out the word “dominated”...

25:39.880 --> 25:42.804
and she'd said,
“No. The correct word is 'tamed.”'

25:42.880 --> 25:46.089
And then when I went to town and bought
the book and started to read it...

25:46.160 --> 25:50.210
I saw that “taming” was the most
important word in the whole book.

25:50.280 --> 25:54.171
By the end of the book, I was in tears,
I was so moved by the story.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.886
<i>And then I went and tried to write
an answer to her letter...</i>

25:56.960 --> 25:58.962
'cause she'd written me a very long letter.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.487
But I just couldn't find the right words,
so finally I took my hand...

26:02.560 --> 26:05.404
I put it on a piece of paper,
I outlined it with a pen...

26:05.480 --> 26:08.324
and I wrote in the center something
like, “Your heart is in my hand.”

26:08.400 --> 26:10.050
Something like that.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.168
Then I went over
to my brother's house to swim...

26:12.240 --> 26:14.641
'cause he lives nearby in the country
and he has a pool.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.762
And he wasn't home.
I went into his library...

26:16.840 --> 26:19.889
and he had bought at an auction
the collected issues of Minotaure.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.403
You know, the surrealist magazine? Oh, it's a great,
great surrealist magazine of the '20s and '30s.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.569
And I never - You know,
I consider myself a bit of a surrealist.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.211
I had never, ever seen
a copy of Minotaure.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.601
And here they all were,
bound, year after year.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.048
So, at random,
I picked one out, I opened it up...

26:36.120 --> 26:39.488
and there was a full-page reproduction
of the letter

26:39.560 --> 26:41.642
<i>from Tenniel's Alice In Wonderland.</i>

26:41.720 --> 26:45.042
And I thought, that - Well, you know,
it's been a day of coincidences...

26:45.120 --> 26:47.851
but that's not unusual that the surrealists
would have been interested in Alice...

26:47.960 --> 26:49.962
and I did a play of <i>Alice.</i>

26:50.040 --> 26:54.284
So at random,
I opened to another page...

26:54.360 --> 26:57.887
and there were four handprints.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.884
One was André Breton,
another was André Derain...

27:00.960 --> 27:03.531
the third was André -
I've got it written down somewhere.

27:03.640 --> 27:07.565
It's not Malraux. it's, like, someone -
Another of the surrealists.

27:07.640 --> 27:12.521
All A's, and the fourth
was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry...

27:12.600 --> 27:14.648
<i>who wrote The Little Prince.</i>

27:14.720 --> 27:17.200
And they'd shown these handprints
to some kind of expert...

27:17.320 --> 27:20.130
without saying
whose hands they belonged to.

27:20.240 --> 27:24.040
And under Exupéry's,
it said that he was an artist...

27:24.160 --> 27:26.447
with very powerful eyes...

27:26.520 --> 27:30.366
who was a tamer of wild animals.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.647
I thought,
“This is incredible, you know.”

27:32.720 --> 27:36.486
And I looked back to see
when the issue came out.

27:36.560 --> 27:40.406
It came out on the newsstands
May 12, 1934...

27:40.480 --> 27:44.769
and I was born during the day
of May 11, 1934.

27:45.840 --> 27:51.006
So, well, that's what started me on, uh,
Saint-Exupéry and The <i>Little</i> Prince.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.126
Now, of course, today -

28:01.240 --> 28:04.687
today I think there's a very fascistic
thing under The Little Prince.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.001
You know, I-
Well, no, I think there's a kind of-

28:07.120 --> 28:12.524
[ Laughing ] I think a kind of S.S.
totalitarian sentimentality in there somewhere.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.365
You know, there's something, you know -
that-

28:15.440 --> 28:17.602
that love of, urn -

28:17.680 --> 28:22.129
Well, that masculine love
of a certain kind of oily muscle.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.443
You know what I mean?
I mean, I can't quite put my finger on it.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.161
But I can just imagine
some beautiful S.S. man...

28:29.240 --> 28:31.242
- loving The Little Prince.
- [Wally Laughs]

28:31.320 --> 28:33.971
Now, I don't know why, but there's
something wrong with it. It stinks.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.281
[ High-pitched Laughing ]

28:39.880 --> 28:44.283
Well, didn't George tell me that you were gonna
do a play that was based on The Little Prince?

28:44.360 --> 28:47.569
Hmm. Well, what happened, Wally...

28:47.640 --> 28:50.246
was that fall I was in New York...

28:50.320 --> 28:53.767
and I met this young Japanese
Buddhist priest named Kozan...

28:53.840 --> 28:56.366
and I thought he was Puck
from the Midsummer Night's <i>Dream.</i>

28:56.440 --> 28:58.681
You know,
he had this beautiful, delicate smile.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.728
I thought <i>he</i> was the Little Prince.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.242
So, naturally, I decided
to go off to the Sahara desert...

29:04.320 --> 29:07.847
to work on The <i>Little Prince</i>
with two actors and this Japanese monk.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.843
You did?

29:09.920 --> 29:14.881
Well, I mean, I was still in a very
peculiar state at that time, Wally.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.362
You know, I would - I would look
in the rearview mirror of my car...

29:18.440 --> 29:21.284
and see little birds
flying out of my mouth.

29:22.320 --> 29:26.609
And I remember always being
exhausted in that period.

29:26.680 --> 29:30.765
I always felt weak. You know, I really
didn't know what was going on with me.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.765
I would just sit out there all alone
in the country for days...

29:34.840 --> 29:38.049
and do nothing but write in my diary.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.964
- And I was always thinking about death.
<i>- Huh.</i>

29:41.040 --> 29:43.042
<i>But you went to the Sahara.</i>

29:43.120 --> 29:45.202
<i>Oh, yes, we went off into the desert...</i>

29:45.280 --> 29:47.408
and we rode through the desert
on camels.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.403
And we rode and we rode.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.926
And then at night we would walk out
under that enormous sky...

29:52.000 --> 29:54.082
and look at the stars.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.721
I just kept thinking about the same things
that I was always thinking about at home -

29:57.800 --> 29:59.882
particularly about Chiquita.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.362
In fact, I thought about
just about nothing but my marriage.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.641
And then I remember
one incredibly dark night...

30:07.720 --> 30:10.963
being at an oasis, and there were
palm trees moving in the wind...

30:11.040 --> 30:14.761
and I could hear Kozan singing
far away in that beautiful bass voice.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.571
And I tried to follow his voice
along the sand.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.563
[ Laughing 1

30:19.640 --> 30:22.644
You see, I thought he had
something to teach me, Wally.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.242
And sometimes
I would meditate with him.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.324
Sometimes I'd go off
and meditate by myself.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.604
You know,
I would see images of Chiquita.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.921
Once I actually saw her growing old...

30:36.000 --> 30:38.651
and her hair turning gray
in front of my eyes.

30:38.720 --> 30:43.726
And I would just wail and yell my lungs out
out there on the dunes.

30:46.760 --> 30:50.685
Anyway,
the desert was pretty horrible.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.683
It was pretty cold.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.242
We were searching for something, but we
couldn't tell if we were finding anything.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.368
You know that once Kozan and I -

30:58.440 --> 31:00.966
we were sitting on a dune,
and we just ate sand.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.480
No, we weren't trying to be funny.
I started, then he started.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.320
We just ate sand and threw up.
That's how desperate we were.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.126
In other words, we didn't know why we were there.
We didn't know what we were looking for.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.283
The entire thing seemed
completely absurd, arid and empty.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.842
It was like, uh -
like a last chance or something.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.287
<i>Huh.</i>

31:20.360 --> 31:22.647
So what happened then?

31:22.720 --> 31:25.530
<i>Well, in those days...</i>

31:25.600 --> 31:27.887
I went completely on impulse.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.123
So on impulse I brought Kozan back
to stay with us in New York...

31:31.240 --> 31:34.767
after we got back from the Sahara,
and he stayed for six months.

31:34.880 --> 31:38.805
<i>- And he really sort of took over the whole family, in a way.
- What do you mean'?</i>

31:38.880 --> 31:43.169
<i>Well, there was certainly a center
missing in the house at the time.</i>

31:43.240 --> 31:45.760
There certainly wasn't a father,
'cause I was always thinking...

31:45.840 --> 31:49.287
about going off to Tibet
or doing God knows what.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.727
And so he taught the whole family
to meditate...

31:51.800 --> 31:56.010
and he told them all about Asia and the
East and his monastery and everything.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.608
He really captivated everybody
with an incredible bag of tricks.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.490
He had literally
developed himself, Wally...

32:03.560 --> 32:08.327
so that he could push on his fingers
and rise off out of his chair.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.368
I mean, he could literally go like this -

32:10.440 --> 32:12.681
You know, push on his fingers
and go into like a headstand...

32:12.760 --> 32:14.888
and just hold himself there
with two fingers.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.327
Or if Chiquita would suddenly get
a little tension in her neck...

32:17.440 --> 32:20.683
well, he'd immediately have her down on the
floor, he'd be walking up and down on her back...

32:20.760 --> 32:23.809
doing these unbelievable massages,
you know.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.962
And the children found him amazing.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.283
I mean, you know, we'd visit friends
who had children...

32:30.360 --> 32:32.480
and immediately
he'd be playing with these children...

32:32.520 --> 32:34.522
in a way that, you know, we just can't do.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.371
I mean, those children -
just giggles, giggles, giggles...

32:37.440 --> 32:40.887
about what this Japanese monk
was doing in these holy robes.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.930
I mean, he was an acrobat,
a ventriloquist...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.571
a magician, everything.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.608
You know,
the amazing thing was that...

32:48.680 --> 32:51.047
I don't think he had any interest
in children whatsoever.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.407
None at all.
I don't think he liked them.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.562
I mean, you know,
when he stayed with us...

32:55.640 --> 32:58.405
in the first week, really, the kids
were just googly-eyed over him.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.404
But then a couple of weeks later,
Chiquita and I could be out...

33:01.480 --> 33:04.450
and Marina could have flu
or a temperature of 104...

33:04.520 --> 33:07.126
and he wouldn't even go in
and say hello to her.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.682
But he was taking over more and more.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.406
I mean, his own habits
had completely changed.

33:13.480 --> 33:18.247
You know, he started wearing these elegant
Gucci shoes under his white monk's robes.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.368
He was eating huge amounts of food.

33:20.440 --> 33:23.922
I mean, he ate twice as much
as Nicolas ate, you know?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.571
This tiny little Buddhist
when I first met him, you know...

33:26.640 --> 33:29.610
was eating a little bowl of milk -
hot milk with rice -

33:29.680 --> 33:32.331
was now eating huge beef.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.931
It was just very strange.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.567
You know, and we had tried working together,
but really our work consisted mostly...

33:40.640 --> 33:45.441
of my trying to do these incredibly painful
prostrations that they do in the monastery.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.603
You know, so really we hadn't
been working very much.

33:48.680 --> 33:54.050
Anyway, we were out in the country, and
we all went to Christmas mass together.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.361
You know, he was all dressed up
in his Buddhist finery.

33:56.480 --> 34:00.451
And it was one of those - one of those awful,
dreary Catholic churches on Long Island...

34:00.520 --> 34:04.570
where the priest talks about
communism and birth control.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.610
And as I was sitting there in mass, I was
wondering, “What in the world is going on?”

34:08.679 --> 34:10.648
I mean, here I am. I'm a grown man...

34:10.719 --> 34:13.371
and there's this strange person living
in the house, and I'm not working -

34:13.440 --> 34:16.967
You know, I was doing nothing
but scribbling a little poetry in my diary.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.523
And I can't get a job teaching anymore,
and I don't know what I want to do.

34:21.600 --> 34:27.164
When all of a sudden a huge creature
appeared, looking at the congregation.

34:27.239 --> 34:31.643
It was about, I'd say, 6'8” -
something like that, you know...

34:31.719 --> 34:34.690
and it was -
it was half bull, half man...

34:34.800 --> 34:36.928
and its skin was blue.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.686
It had violets growing out of its eyelids
and poppies growing out of its toenails.

34:40.760 --> 34:44.481
<i>And it just stood there
for the whole mass.</i>

34:44.600 --> 34:47.001
I mean, I could not make
that creature disappear.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.083
You know, I thought, “Oh, well. You know,
I'm just seeing this 'cause I'm bored.”

34:50.159 --> 34:55.371
You know, close my -
I could not make that creature go away.

34:55.440 --> 34:59.365
Okay. Now, I didn't talk with people about
it, because they'd think I was weird...

34:59.440 --> 35:04.924
but I felt that this creature
was somehow coming to comfort me...

35:05.040 --> 35:08.328
that somehow
he was appearing to say...

35:08.400 --> 35:13.008
“Well, you may feel low and you might
not be able to create a play right now...

35:13.080 --> 35:17.051
“but look at what can come to you
on Christmas Eve. Hang on, old friend.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.010
“I may seem weird to you,
but on these weird voyages...

35:20.080 --> 35:22.048
“weird creatures appear.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.045
It's part of the journey.
You're okay. Hang in there.”

35:31.360 --> 35:33.727
By the way, uh, did you ever see...

35:33.800 --> 35:37.486
<i>that play, uh, The Violets are Blue?</i>

35:39.320 --> 35:41.243
No.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.529
Oh, when you mentioned the violets,
it-it reminded me of that.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.570
It-It was about, urn, people...

35:47.640 --> 35:50.723
being, uh, strangled
on a - on a submarine.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.087
Hmm.

35:57.040 --> 36:02.001
[ Sighs ] Well, so that was -
[ Chuckles ] that was Christmas.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.765
What happened after that?

36:04.840 --> 36:07.810
- Do you really want to hear about all this?
- Yeah.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.566
Well, around that time...

36:14.680 --> 36:18.480
I was beginning to think about going to India.
And Kozan suddenly left one day.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.928
I was beginning to get into a lot
of very strange ideas around that time.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.130
Now, for example, I'd developed this -
Well, I got this idea which I -

36:26.200 --> 36:29.363
Now, it was very appealing to me
at the time, you know -

36:29.440 --> 36:32.762
which was that I would have a flag,
a large flag...

36:32.840 --> 36:35.207
and that wherever I worked,
this flag would fly.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.609
Or if we were outside, say, with a group, that the
flag could be the thing we lay on at night...

36:39.680 --> 36:43.446
and that somehow, between working on
this flag and lying on this flag...

36:43.520 --> 36:45.443
this flag flying over us...

36:45.520 --> 36:49.491
that the flag would pick up
vibrations of a kind...

36:49.600 --> 36:52.331
that would still be in the flag
when I brought it home.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.563
So I went down to meet this flag maker
that I'd heard about.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.688
And you know, there was
this very straightforward-looking guy.

36:57.760 --> 37:02.561
You know, very sweet, really healthy-looking
and everything. Nice big, blond.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.644
And he had a beautiful, clean loft down
in the village with lovely, happy flags.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.202
<i>And</i> I <i>was all into The Little Prince, and</i> I
talked <i>to him</i> about <i>The Little Prince...</i>

37:09.280 --> 37:13.171
these adventures and everything, howl needed
the flag and what the flag should be.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.561
He seemed to really connect with it.

37:15.640 --> 37:18.166
So, two weeks later, I came back.

37:18.240 --> 37:21.961
He showed me a flag that I thought
was very odd, you know...

37:22.040 --> 37:24.042
'cause I had, you know -
well, you know...

37:24.120 --> 37:27.488
I had expected something
gentle and lyrical.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.961
There was something about this
that was so powerful...

37:30.040 --> 37:32.008
it was almost overwhelming.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.082
And it did include the Tibetan swastika.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.841
He put a swastika in your flag?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.651
No, it was the Tibetan swastika,
not the Nazi swastika.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.087
It's one of the most ancient
Tibetan symbols.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.209
And it was just strange, you know?

37:46.280 --> 37:49.887
But I brought it home,
because my idea with this flag...

37:49.960 --> 37:52.440
was that before I left -
you know, before I left for India...

37:52.560 --> 37:56.360
I wanted several people who were close to me
to have this flag in the room for the night...

37:56.480 --> 37:59.927
to sleep with it, you know, and then in the
morning to sew something into the flag.

38:00.040 --> 38:04.090
So I took the flag into Marina, and I said,
“Hey, look at this. What do you think of this?”

38:04.160 --> 38:06.925
And she said, “What is that? That's awful.”
I said, “It's a flag.”

38:07.000 --> 38:08.684
And she said, “I don't like it.”

38:08.760 --> 38:12.003
I said, “I kind of thought you might like
to spend the night with it, you know.”

38:12.080 --> 38:15.050
But she really thought
the flag was awful.

38:15.120 --> 38:19.489
So then Chiquita threw this party
for me before I left for India...

38:19.560 --> 38:21.642
and the apartment
was filled with guests.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.803
And at one point Chiquita said,
“The flag, the flag. Where's the flag?”

38:24.880 --> 38:28.885
And I said, “Oh, yeah. The flag.” And I
go and get the flag, and I open it up.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.851
Chiquita goes absolutely white
and runs out of the room and vomits.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.242
So the party just comes to a halt
and breaks up.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.051
And then the next day
I gave it to this young woman...

38:39.120 --> 38:41.726
who'd been in my group in Poland,
who was now in New York.

38:41.840 --> 38:45.322
I didn't tell her anything
about any of this.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.846
At 5:00 in the morning,
she called me up and she said...

38:47.920 --> 38:50.400
“I gotta come and see you right away.”
I thought, “Oh, God.”

38:50.480 --> 38:54.246
She came up, and she said, “I saw things -
I saw things around this flag.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.324
“Now, I know you're stubborn, and I know
you want to take this thing with you...

38:57.400 --> 39:00.449
“but if you'd follow my advice,
you'd put it in a hole in the ground...

39:00.520 --> 39:03.410
and burn it and cover it with earth,
'cause the devil's in it.”

39:03.480 --> 39:05.403
I never took the flag with me.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.929
In fact, I gave it to her, and, uh,
she - she had a ceremony with it...

39:10.000 --> 39:12.480
six months later, in France,
with some friends...

39:12.560 --> 39:14.767
in which, uh, they did burn it.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.128
[ Laughing ] God.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.602
That's really, really amazing.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.851
So, did you ever go to India?

39:25.920 --> 39:29.288
Oh, yes, I-I went to India
in the spring, Wally...

39:29.360 --> 39:31.840
and I came back home
feeling all wrong.

39:31.920 --> 39:36.369
I mean, you know, I'd been to India,
and I'd just felt like a tourist.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.284
I'd found nothing.

39:39.360 --> 39:44.048
So I was - I was spending, uh, the summer
on Long Island with my family...

39:44.120 --> 39:47.124
and I heard about this community
in Scotland called Findhorn...

39:47.200 --> 39:50.761
where people sang and talked
and meditated with plants.

39:50.880 --> 39:56.410
And it was founded by several rather
middle-class English and Scottish eccentrics.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.801
Some of them intellectuals,
and some of them not.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.326
And I'd heard that they'd
grown things in soil...

40:01.400 --> 40:04.609
that supposedly nothing can grow in,
'cause it's almost beach soil...

40:04.680 --> 40:08.890
and that they'd built - not built - they'd
grown the largest cauliflowers in the world...

40:08.960 --> 40:10.928
and there are sort of cabbages.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.846
And they've grown trees
that can't grow in the British Isles.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.685
So I went there.
I mean, it is an amazing place, Wally.

40:17.760 --> 40:21.924
I mean, if there are insects
bothering the plants...

40:22.000 --> 40:25.527
they will talk with the insects
and, you know, make an agreement...

40:25.600 --> 40:29.730
by which they'll set aside a special patch
of vegetables just for the insects...

40:29.800 --> 40:31.928
and then the insects
will leave the main part alone.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.002
- Huh.
- Things like that.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.606
And everything they do
they do beautifully.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.490
I mean, the buildings just shine.

40:39.560 --> 40:43.531
And I mean, for instance, the icebox,
the stove, the car - they all have names.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.887
And since you wouldn't treat Helen,
the icebox...

40:45.960 --> 40:48.281
with any less respect
than you would Margaret, your wife...

40:48.400 --> 40:52.291
you know, you make sure that Helen is as clean
as Margaret, or treated with equal respect.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.522
[Wally Giggles ]

40:54.600 --> 40:59.128
And when I was there, Wally,
I remember being in the woods...

40:59.200 --> 41:03.888
and I would look at a leaf,
and I would actually see that thing...

41:03.960 --> 41:07.169
that is alive in that leaf.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.289
And then I remember just running
through the woods as fast as I could...

41:10.360 --> 41:12.840
with this incredible laugh
coming out of me...

41:12.920 --> 41:18.131
<i>and really being in that state, you know,
where laughter and tears seem to merge.</i>

41:18.200 --> 41:20.202
I mean, it absolutely blasted me open.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.363
When I came out of Findhorn,
I was hallucinating nonstop.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.091
I was seeing clouds as creatures.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.766
The people on the airplane
all had animals' faces.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.930
I mean, I was on a trip. It was like being
in a William Blake world suddenly.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.968
Things were exploding.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.364
So immediately I went to Belgrade,
'cause I wanted to talk to Grotowski.

41:39.440 --> 41:42.728
Grotowski and I got together
at midnight in my hotel room...

41:42.800 --> 41:46.247
and we drank instant coffee
out of the top of my shaving cream...

41:46.320 --> 41:50.450
and we talked from midnight
until 11:00 the next morning.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.966
- God. What did he say?
- Nothing!

41:53.040 --> 41:55.088
I talked. He didn't say a word.

41:55.200 --> 41:59.808
And - And then I guess really...

41:59.880 --> 42:03.930
the last big experience of this kind
took place that fall.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.008
It was out at Montauk on Long Island...

42:06.080 --> 42:09.687
and there were only about nine
of us involved, mostly men.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.809
And we borrowed Dick Avedon's property
out at Montauk.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.043
And the country out there
is like Heathcliff country.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.726
It's absolutely wild.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.201
What we wanted to do was
we wanted to take, you know -

42:21.280 --> 42:23.647
We wanted to take All Souls' Eve,
Halloween...

42:23.720 --> 42:26.041
and use it as a point of departure
for something.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.647
So each one of us prepared
some sort of event for the others...

42:29.720 --> 42:32.530
somehow in the spirit
of All Souls' Eve.

42:32.600 --> 42:35.524
But the biggest event
was three of the people...

42:35.600 --> 42:38.001
kept disappearing
in the middle of the night each night...

42:38.080 --> 42:40.481
and we knew they were
preparing something big...

42:40.560 --> 42:42.562
but we didn't know what.

42:42.640 --> 42:46.850
And midnight on Halloween,
under a dark moon, above these cliffs...

42:46.960 --> 42:50.726
we were all told to gather at the topmost
cliff and that we would be taken somewhere.

42:50.800 --> 42:55.169
And we did.
And we waited, and it was very, very cold.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.961
And then the three of them - Helen, Bill
and Fred - showed up wearing white.

42:59.040 --> 43:03.090
You know, something they'd made out of
sheets - looked a little spooky, not funny.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.888
And they took us into the basement of this
house that had burned down on the property.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.085
And in this ruined basement, they had set
up a table with benches they'd made.

43:12.160 --> 43:17.326
And on this table they had laid out paper,
pencils, wine and glasses.

43:17.400 --> 43:22.691
And we were all asked to sit at the table and
to make out our last will and testament.

43:22.760 --> 43:26.321
You know, to think about and write down
whatever our last words were to the world...

43:26.400 --> 43:28.687
or to somebody we were very close to.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.445
And that's quite a task.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.047
I must have been there for about
an hour and a half or so, maybe two.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.522
And then one at a time they would ask
one of us to come with them...

43:38.600 --> 43:40.602
and I was one of the last.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.121
And they came for me,
and they put a blindfold on me...

43:43.200 --> 43:45.407
and they ran me through these fields -
two people.

43:45.480 --> 43:49.644
And they'd found a kind of potting shed -
you know, a kind of shed, on the grounds...

43:49.720 --> 43:53.202
a little tiny room
that had once had tools in it.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.363
And they took me down the steps,
into this basement...

43:56.440 --> 44:01.321
and the room was just filled
with harsh white light.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.927
Then they told me to get undressed
and give them all my valuables.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.446
Then they put me on a table,
and they sponged me down.

44:07.520 --> 44:12.048
Well, you know, I just started flashing
on-on-on death camps and secret police.

44:12.160 --> 44:15.960
I don't know what happened to the other people,
but I just started to cry uncontrollably.

44:16.040 --> 44:20.568
Uh, then-then they got me to my feet
and they took photographs of me, naked.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.450
And then naked, again blindfolded,
I was run through these forests...

44:23.560 --> 44:26.803
and we came to a kind of tent made of
sheets, with sheets on the ground.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.928
And there were all these naked bodies...

44:29.000 --> 44:32.527
huddling together
for warmth against the cold.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.762
Must have been left there
for about an hour.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.969
And then again, one by one,
one at a time, we were led out.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.042
The blindfold was put on...

44:40.120 --> 44:43.806
and I felt myself being lowered
onto something like a stretcher.

44:43.880 --> 44:48.807
And the stretcher was carried a long way,
very slowly, through these forests...

44:48.880 --> 44:54.683
and then I felt myself
being lowered into the ground.

44:54.760 --> 44:58.481
They had, in fact, dug six graves...

44:58.560 --> 45:01.245
eight feet deep.

45:01.320 --> 45:05.689
And then I felt these pieces of wood
being put on me.

45:05.760 --> 45:09.128
And I cannot tell you, Wally,
what I was going through.

45:09.200 --> 45:12.568
And then the stretcher was lowered
into the grave...

45:12.640 --> 45:14.642
and then this wood was put on me...

45:14.720 --> 45:17.200
and then my valuables were put on me,
in my hands.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.090
And they'd taken, you know,
a kind of sheet or canvas...

45:20.160 --> 45:22.686
and they'd stretched about this much
above my head...

45:22.760 --> 45:25.570
and then they shoveled dirt
into the grave...

45:26.880 --> 45:31.522
so that I really had the feeling
of being buried alive.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.490
And after being in the grave
for about half an hour -

45:36.560 --> 45:39.848
I mean, I didn't know how long
I'd be in there -

45:39.920 --> 45:42.491
I was resurrected,
lifted out of the grave...

45:42.560 --> 45:44.961
blindfold taken off,
and run through these fields.

45:45.040 --> 45:49.489
And we came to a great circle of fire,
with music and hot wine...

45:49.600 --> 45:51.682
and everyone danced until dawn.

45:51.760 --> 45:55.082
[Chuckling ]
And then at dawn...

45:55.160 --> 45:58.164
to the best of our ability,
we filled up the graves...

45:58.240 --> 46:00.925
and went back to New York.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.721
And that was really the last big event.
I mean, that was the end.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.802
I mean, you know, I began to realize...

46:09.880 --> 46:12.565
I just didn't want to do these things
anymore, you know?

46:12.640 --> 46:17.123
I felt sort of becalmed, you know,
like that chapter in Moby <i>Dick...</i>

46:17.200 --> 46:20.329
where the wind goes out of the sails.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.165
And then last winter, without, uh,
thinking about it very much...

46:23.240 --> 46:27.529
I went to see this agent I know to tell him
I was interested in directing plays again.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.046
Actually,
he seemed a little surprised...

46:30.120 --> 46:33.647
to see that Rip van Winkle
was still alive.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.203
Mmm.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.328
<i>God.</i>

46:43.400 --> 46:45.289
I didn't know they were so small.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.045
<i>[ André Chuckles ]</i>

46:48.120 --> 46:50.282
<i>Well, you know, frankly...</i>

46:50.360 --> 46:53.204
I'm sort of repelled by the whole story,
if you really want to know.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.681
- What?
- Ah, you know -

46:55.760 --> 46:57.728
Who did I think I was, you know?

46:57.800 --> 47:02.488
I mean, that's the story of some kind
of spoiled princess, you know.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.881
Who did I think I was,
the Shah of Iran?

47:04.960 --> 47:09.761
You know, I really wonder if people such as
myself are really not Albert Speer, Wally.

47:09.840 --> 47:14.004
- You know, Hitler's architect, Albert Speer?
- What?

47:14.120 --> 47:17.761
No, I've been thinking a lot about him
recently because, uh, I think I am Speer.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.923
And I think it's time that I was caught
and tried the way he was.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.604
What are you talking about?

47:22.720 --> 47:26.611
Well, you know, he was a very cultivated
man, an architect, an artist, you know...

47:26.680 --> 47:30.048
so he thought the ordinary rules of life
didn't apply to him either.

47:32.720 --> 47:36.566
I mean, I really feel
that everything I've done...

47:36.640 --> 47:39.211
is horrific, just horrific.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.250
My God. But why?

47:42.320 --> 47:46.928
You see - You see, I've seen a lot of death
in the last few years, Wally...

47:47.000 --> 47:49.287
and there's one thing
that's for sure about death -

47:49.360 --> 47:51.840
You do it alone, you see.
That seems quite certain, you see.

47:51.920 --> 47:55.083
That I've seen. That the people
around your bed mean nothing.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.130
Your reviews mean nothing.
Whatever it is, you do it alone.

47:58.240 --> 48:02.290
And so the question is, when I get on my
deathbed, what kind of a person am I gonna be?

48:02.400 --> 48:05.244
And I'm just very dubious about the kind
of person who would have lived his life...

48:05.360 --> 48:07.283
those last few years the way I did.

48:07.360 --> 48:09.966
Why should you feel that way?

48:10.040 --> 48:14.523
You see, I've had a very rough time
in the last few months, Wally.

48:14.600 --> 48:18.525
Three different people in my family
were in the hospital at the same time.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.523
Then my mother died.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.644
Then Marina had something wrong with her back,
and we were terribly worried about her.

48:23.720 --> 48:26.929
You know, so - so, I mean,
I'm feeling very raw right now.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.163
I mean, uh - I mean, I can't sleep,
my nerves are shot.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.208
I mean, I'm affected by everything.

48:32.280 --> 48:36.410
You know, la-last week I had this really
nice director from Norway over for dinner...

48:36.480 --> 48:38.721
and he's someone
I've known for years and years...

48:38.800 --> 48:41.087
and he's somebody
that I think I'm quite fond of.

48:41.160 --> 48:44.323
And I was sitting there just thinking
that he was a pompous, defensive...

48:44.440 --> 48:46.841
conservative stuffed shirt
who was only interested in the theater.

48:46.920 --> 48:50.402
He was talking and talking. His mother
had been a famous Norwegian comedienne.

48:50.520 --> 48:54.844
I realized he had said “I remember my mother”
at least 400 times during the evening.

48:54.920 --> 48:58.129
<i>And he was telling story after story
about his mother.</i>

48:58.200 --> 49:01.090
<i>You know, I'd heard these stories
20 times in the past.</i>

49:01.160 --> 49:03.845
He was drinking this whole bottle
of bourbon very quietly.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.042
His laugh was so horrible.

49:06.120 --> 49:09.727
You know, I could hear his laugh -
the pain in that laugh, the hollowness.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.241
You know, what being that woman's son
had done to him.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.041
You know, so at a certain point I just had
to ask him to leave - nicely, you know.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.602
I told him I had to get up early the
next morning, 'cause it was so horrible.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.081
It was just as if he had died
in my living room.

49:22.160 --> 49:26.245
You know, then I went into the bathroom
and cried 'cause I felt I'd lost a friend.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.527
And then after he'd gone,
I turned the television on...

49:28.600 --> 49:30.967
and there was this guy who had
just won the something-something.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.562
Some sports event - some kind of a great big
check and some kind of huge silver bottle.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.120
And he, you know - he couldn't stuff
the check in the bottle...

49:37.160 --> 49:40.369
and he put the bottle in front of his nose
and pretended it was his face.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.681
He wasn't really listening
to the guy who was interviewing him...

49:42.800 --> 49:46.320
but he was smiling malevolently at his friends,
and I looked at that guy and I thought...

49:46.360 --> 49:50.410
“What a horrible, empty,
manipulative rat.”

49:50.480 --> 49:54.405
Then I thought, “That guy is me.”
[ Laughing ]

49:54.480 --> 49:57.689
Then last night actually, you know,
it was our 20th wedding anniversary...

49:57.760 --> 49:59.967
and I took Chiquita to see
this show about Billie Holiday.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.601
I looked at these show business people who
know nothing about Billie Holiday, nothing.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.287
You see, they were really kind of,
in a way, intellectual creeps.

50:07.440 --> 50:11.240
And I suddenly had this feeling. I mean, you know, I was
just sitting there, crying through most of the show.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.170
And I suddenly had this feeling
I was just as creepy as they were...

50:14.280 --> 50:16.248
and that my whole life
had been a sham...

50:16.320 --> 50:19.164
and I didn't have the guts
to be Billie Holiday either.

50:19.240 --> 50:23.131
I mean, I really feel
that I'm just washed up, wiped out.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.885
I feel I've just squandered my life.

50:29.360 --> 50:33.285
<i>André, now, how can you say
something like that?</i>

50:33.360 --> 50:35.328
I mean -

50:42.960 --> 50:48.649
Well, you know, I may be in
a very emotional state right now, Wally...

50:48.720 --> 50:51.803
but since I've come back home I've just
been finding the world we're living in...

50:51.880 --> 50:54.326
more and more upsetting.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.324
<i>I mean, last week I went down
to the Public: Theater one afternoon.</i>

50:57.400 --> 50:59.607
You know, when I walked in,
I said hello to everybody...

50:59.720 --> 51:02.610
'cause I know them all, and they all
know me, they're always very friendly.

51:02.680 --> 51:06.526
You know that seven or eight people
told me how wonderful I looked?

51:06.600 --> 51:10.161
And then one person - one - a woman
who runs the casting office, said...

51:10.240 --> 51:12.242
“Gee, you look horrible.
Ls something wrong?”

51:12.320 --> 51:15.324
Now, she - You know, we started talking.
Of course, I started telling her things.

51:15.400 --> 51:19.405
And she suddenly burst into tears
because an aunt of hers who's 80...

51:19.480 --> 51:23.724
whom she's very fond of, went into the
hospital for a cataract, which was solved.

51:23.800 --> 51:27.327
But the nurse was so sloppy,
she didn't put the bed rails up...

51:27.400 --> 51:30.529
and so the aunt fell out of bed
and is now a complete cripple.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.001
So you know, we were talking
about hospitals.

51:33.080 --> 51:36.368
Now, you know, this woman,
because of who she is -

51:36.440 --> 51:38.807
You know, 'cause this had happened
to her very, very recently.

51:38.880 --> 51:42.362
- She could see me with complete clarity.
- Uh-huh.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.522
She didn't know anything
about what I'd been going through.

51:44.600 --> 51:47.206
But the other people, what they saw
was this tan, or this shirt...

51:47.280 --> 51:49.248
or the fact that the shirt
goes well with the tan.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.209
So they said, “Gee, you look wonderful.”

51:51.280 --> 51:54.602
Now, they're living
in an insane dreamworld.

51:54.680 --> 51:57.968
They're not looking.
That seems very strange to me.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.283
Right, because they just didn't
see anything, somehow...

52:01.360 --> 52:04.762
except, uh, the few little things
that they wanted to see.

52:07.800 --> 52:12.362
Yeah, you know, it's like what happened
just before my mother died.

52:12.480 --> 52:14.881
You know, we'd gone to the hospital
to see my mother...

52:14.960 --> 52:17.406
and I went in to see her...

52:17.480 --> 52:22.008
and I saw this woman who looked as bad
as any survivor of Auschwitz or Dachau.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.801
And I was out in the hall
sort of comforting my father...

52:25.880 --> 52:30.010
when a doctor who was a specialist
in a problem she had with her arm...

52:30.080 --> 52:32.924
went into her room
and came out just beaming.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.721
And he said, “Boy, don't we have
a lot of reason to feel great?

52:36.840 --> 52:40.401
Isn't it wonderful
how she's coming along?”

52:40.480 --> 52:45.407
Now, all he saw was the arm.
That's all he saw.

52:45.480 --> 52:49.963
Now, here's another person
who's existing in a dream.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.520
Who, on top of that,
is a kind of butcher...

52:52.600 --> 52:54.841
who's committing
a kind of familial murder...

52:54.920 --> 52:58.129
because when he comes out of that room,
he psychically kills us...

52:58.200 --> 53:00.282
by taking us into a dream world...

53:00.360 --> 53:03.728
where we become confused
and frightened...

53:03.840 --> 53:07.162
'cause the moment before,
we saw somebody who already looked dead...

53:07.240 --> 53:11.768
and now here comes a specialist
who tells us they're in wonderful shape.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.571
I mean, they were literally
driving my father crazy.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.763
I mean, you know, here's an 82-year-old man
who's very emotional...

53:17.880 --> 53:20.929
and you know, and if you go in one moment,
and you see the person's dying...

53:21.000 --> 53:24.004
and you don't want them to die, and then
a doctor comes out five minutes later...

53:24.080 --> 53:26.082
and tells you they're in wonderful shape -

53:26.160 --> 53:28.811
I mean, you know, you can go crazy.

53:28.880 --> 53:32.646
- Yeah. I know what you mean.
- I mean, the doctor didn't see my mother.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.246
The people at the Public Theater
didn't see me.

53:35.320 --> 53:38.369
I mean, we're just walking around
in some kind of fog.

53:38.440 --> 53:42.570
I think we're all in a trance.
We're walking around like zombies.

53:42.640 --> 53:46.326
I don't - I don't think we're even aware
of ourselves or our own reaction to things.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.244
We - We're just going around all day
like unconscious machines...

53:49.320 --> 53:52.449
and meanwhile there's all of this rage
and worry and uneasiness...

53:52.520 --> 53:54.648
just building up
and building up inside us.

53:54.720 --> 53:57.041
That's right. It just builds up, uh...

53:57.120 --> 54:00.442
and then it just leaps out
inappropriately.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.605
I mean, I remember
when I was, uh, acting in this play...

54:04.720 --> 54:06.688
<i>based on The Master and Margarita
by Bulgakov.</i>

54:06.760 --> 54:09.161
And I was playing the part of the cat.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.686
But they had trouble, uh,
making up my cat suit...

54:11.760 --> 54:15.401
so I didn't get it delivered to me
till the night of the first performance.

54:15.520 --> 54:19.127
Particularly the head - I mean,
I'd never even had a chance to try it on.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.761
And about four of my fellow actors
actually came up to me...

54:22.840 --> 54:25.446
and they said these things
which I just couldn't help thinking...

54:25.520 --> 54:27.522
were attempts to destroy me.

54:27.600 --> 54:31.446
You know, one of them said, uh,
“Oh, well, now that head...

54:31.520 --> 54:34.046
“will totally change your hearing
in the performance.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.203
“You may hear everything
completely differently...

54:37.280 --> 54:39.521
“and it may be very upsetting.

54:39.600 --> 54:42.843
“Now, I was once in a performance
where I was wearing earmuffs...

54:42.920 --> 54:46.561
and I couldn't hear anything
anybody said.”

54:46.640 --> 54:50.361
And then another one said, “Oh, you know,
whenever I wear even a hat on stage...

54:50.440 --> 54:52.442
I tend to faint.”

54:52.520 --> 54:55.444
I mean, those remarks
were just full of hostility...

54:55.600 --> 54:59.047
because, I mean, if I'd listened to those
people, I would have gone out there on stage...

54:59.120 --> 55:01.930
and I wouldn't have been able to hear
anything, and I would have fainted.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.968
But the hostility
was completely inappropriate...

55:04.040 --> 55:06.042
because, in fact,
those people liked me.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.567
I mean, that hostility was just
some feeling that was, you know...

55:09.640 --> 55:12.530
left over from
some previous experience.

55:12.600 --> 55:16.002
Because somehow
in our social existence today...

55:16.080 --> 55:19.323
we're only allowed to
express our feelings, uh...

55:19.400 --> 55:21.562
weirdly and indirectly.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.086
If you express them directly,
everybody goes crazy.

55:24.160 --> 55:27.369
Well, did you express your feelings
about what those people said to you?

55:27.440 --> 55:31.490
No. [Chuckles] I mean, I didn't even know
what I felt till I thought about it later.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.962
And I mean, at the most, you know,
in a situation like that, uh...

55:35.040 --> 55:37.281
even if I had known what I felt...

55:37.360 --> 55:40.091
I might say something,
if I'm really annoyed...

55:40.160 --> 55:44.006
like, uh, “Oh, yeah.
Well, that's just fascinating...

55:44.080 --> 55:47.801
and, uh, I probably will
faint tonight, just as you did.”

55:47.880 --> 55:50.770
I do just the same thing myself.

55:50.840 --> 55:54.208
We can't be direct, so we end up
saying the weirdest things.

55:54.280 --> 55:57.489
I mean, I remember a night. It was
a couple of weeks after my mother died.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.483
And I was in pretty bad shape.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.722
And I had dinner with three
relatively close friends...

56:01.800 --> 56:03.768
two of whom had
known my mother quite well...

56:03.880 --> 56:06.451
and all three of whom
had known me for years.

56:06.520 --> 56:09.330
You know that we went through that
entire evening without my being able to...

56:09.400 --> 56:11.368
for a moment,
get anywhere near what-

56:11.440 --> 56:13.681
Not that I wanted to sit
and have this dreary evening...

56:13.760 --> 56:16.650
in which I was talking about all this pain
that I was going through and everything.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.370
Really, not at all.

56:18.440 --> 56:20.647
But the fact that nobody could say...

56:20.720 --> 56:23.564
“Gee, what a shame about your mother”
or “How are you feeling?”

56:23.680 --> 56:27.002
It was just as if nothing had happened. They
were all making these jokes and laughing.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.082
I got quite crazy, as a matter of fact.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.731
One of these people mentioned a certain
man whom I don't like very much...

56:31.800 --> 56:35.646
and I started screeching about how he had
just been found in the Bronx River...

56:35.760 --> 56:39.890
and his penis had dropped off from
gonorrhea, and all kinds of insane things.

56:40.040 --> 56:44.682
And later, when I got home, I realized I'd
just been desperate to break through this ice.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.285
Yeah.

56:46.360 --> 56:50.410
I mean, do you realize, Wally, if you brought
that situation into a Tibetan home -

56:50.480 --> 56:53.484
That'd be just so far out. I mean,
they wouldn't be able to understand it.

56:53.560 --> 56:56.006
That would be simply -
simply so weird, Wally.

56:56.120 --> 57:00.011
If four Tibetans came together, and tragedy
had just struck one of the ones...

57:00.080 --> 57:04.722
and they spent the whole evening going -
[ Loud Laughing ]

57:04.800 --> 57:07.041
<i>I mean, you know,
Tibetans would have looked at that...</i>

57:07.120 --> 57:10.169
and would have thought that was
the most unimaginable behavior.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.647
- But for us, that's common behavior.
- Mm-hmm.

57:12.720 --> 57:16.486
I mean, really, the - the Africans would have
probably put their spears into all four of us...

57:16.560 --> 57:18.528
'cause it would have driven them crazy.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.126
They would have thought we were
dangerous animals or something like that.

57:21.240 --> 57:25.040
- Right.
- I mean, that's absolutely abnormal behavior.

57:25.120 --> 57:27.282
Is everything all right, gentlemen?

57:27.360 --> 57:29.283
- Great.
- Yeah.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.681
But those are
typical evenings for us.

57:35.760 --> 57:39.890
I mean, we go to dinners and parties
like that all the time.

57:39.960 --> 57:43.043
These evenings are really
like sort of sickly dreams...

57:43.120 --> 57:45.566
because people are talking in symbols.

57:45.680 --> 57:49.924
Everyone is sort of floating through this
fog of symbols and unconscious feelings.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.401
No one says what they're
really thinking about.

57:52.480 --> 57:57.486
Then people will start making these jokes
that are really some sort of secret code.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.961
Right. Well, what often happens
in some of these evenings...

58:00.080 --> 58:04.483
is that these really crazy little fantasies
will just start being played with, you know...

58:04.560 --> 58:07.689
and everyone will be talking at once
and sort of saying...

58:07.760 --> 58:11.651
“Hey, wouldn't it be great if Frank Sinatra
and Mrs. Nixon and blah-blah-blah...

58:11.720 --> 58:14.246
were in such and such a situation?”

58:14.320 --> 58:17.722
You know, always with famous people,
and always sort of grotesque.

58:17.800 --> 58:20.406
Or people will be talking about
some horrible thing...

58:20.480 --> 58:25.008
like - like, uh, the death of that girl
in the car with Ted Kennedy...

58:25.080 --> 58:27.560
and they'll just be
roaring with laughter.

58:27.640 --> 58:30.086
I mean, it's really amazing.
It's just unbelievable.

58:30.160 --> 58:35.291
That's the only way anything is expressed,
through these completely insane jokes.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.603
I mean, I think that's why I never
understand what's going on at a party.

58:38.680 --> 58:41.889
I'm always completely confused.

58:41.960 --> 58:46.727
You know, uh, Debby once said,
after one of these New York evenings...

58:46.800 --> 58:49.121
she thought she'd traveled
a greater distance...

58:49.200 --> 58:52.682
just by journeying from her origins
in the suburbs of Chicago...

58:52.760 --> 58:54.762
to that New York evening...

58:54.840 --> 58:57.889
than her grandmother had traveled
in, uh, making her way...

58:57.960 --> 59:00.645
from the steppes of Russia
to the suburbs of Chicago.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.041
- I think that's right.
- [Wally Chuckles ]

59:04.160 --> 59:06.811
You know, it may - it may be, Wally,
that one of the reasons...

59:06.880 --> 59:08.803
that we don't know
what's going on...

59:08.880 --> 59:11.804
is that when we're there at a party,
we're all too busy performing.

59:11.880 --> 59:13.166
Uh-huh.

59:13.240 --> 59:16.687
That was one of the reasons
that, uh, Grotowski gave up the theater.

59:16.760 --> 59:20.924
He just felt that people in their lives now
were performing so well...

59:21.000 --> 59:23.685
that performance in the theater
was sort of superfluous...

59:23.760 --> 59:25.683
and, in a way, obscene.

59:25.760 --> 59:28.001
Huh.

59:28.080 --> 59:30.811
Isn't it amazing
how often a doctor...

59:30.920 --> 59:33.605
will live up to our expectation
of how a doctor should look?

59:33.680 --> 59:37.207
When you see a terrorist on television,
he looks just like a terrorist.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.806
I mean, we live in a world
in which fathers...

59:39.880 --> 59:42.087
or single people, or artists...

59:42.160 --> 59:44.367
are all trying to live up
to someone's fantasy...

59:44.440 --> 59:48.490
of how a father, or a single person,
or an artist should look and behave.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.325
They all act as if they know exactly how
they ought to conduct themselves...

59:51.440 --> 59:53.363
at every single moment...

59:53.440 --> 59:55.522
and they all seem totally self-confident.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.080
Of course, privately people
are very mixed up about themselves.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.366
Yeah.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.647
They don't know what they should
be doing with their lives.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.881
- They're reading all these self-help books.
- Oh, God!

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.491
I mean, those books are just so touching,
because they show...

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.484
how desperately curious we all are
to know how all the others of us...

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.528
are really getting on in life...

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.365
even though, by performing
these roles all the time...

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.444
we're just hiding the reality of ourselves
from everybody else.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.126
I mean, we live in such
ludicrous ignorance of each other.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.407
We usually don't know
the things we'd like to know...

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.482
even about our supposedly
closest friends.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.483
I mean - I mean, you know...

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.120
suppose you're going through
some kind of hell in your own life.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.562
Well, you would love to know if your
friends have experienced similar things.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.642
But we just don't dare to ask each other.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.121
No. It would be like asking
your friend to drop his role.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.647
I mean, we just put no value at all
on perceiving reality.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.361
I mean, on the contrary, this incredible
emphasis that we all place now...

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.408
on our so-called careers...

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.122
automatically makes perceiving reality
a very low priority...

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.888
because if your life is organized around
trying to be successful in a career...

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.046
well, it just doesn't matter what
you perceive or what you experience.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.408
You can really sort of shut your mind off
for years ahead, in a way.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.404
You can sort of
turn on the automatic pilot.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.882
You know, just the way your mother's doctor
had on his automatic pilot...

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.167
when he went in
and he looked at the arm...

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.720
and he totally failed
to perceive anything else.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.771
<i>That's right. Our - Our minds are just
focused on these goals and plans...</i>

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.808
which in themselves
are not reality.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.282
No. Goals and plans are not-

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.729
I mean, they're - they're fantasy.
They're part of a dream life.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.361
I mean, you know, it always just
does seem so ridiculous, somehow...

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.126
that everybody has to have
his little - his little goal in life.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.489
I mean, it's so absurd, in a way, when you
consider that it doesn't matter which one it is.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.040
Right. And because people's
concentration is on their goals...

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.124
in their life
they just live each moment by habit.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.363
Really, like the Norwegian telling
the same stories over and over again.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.011
- Mm-hmm.
- Life becomes habitual.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.287
<i>And it is today.</i>

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.488
I mean, very few things happen now
like that moment...

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.325
when Marlon Brando sent the Indian woman
to accept the Oscar...

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.323
and everything went haywire.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.846
Things just very rarely
go haywire now.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.969
<i>And if you're just operating by habit...</i>

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.850
then you're not really living.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.605
I mean, you know, in Sanskrit,
the root of the verb “to be”...

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.001
is the same as “to grow”
or “to make grow.”

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.003
Huh.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.328
<i>[ Woman Laughing ]</i>

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.323
<i>- Do you know about Roc?
- Hmm'?</i>

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.482
<i>[ Chuckling ] Oh, well.</i>

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.562
Roc was a wonderful man.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.967
He was one of the founders
of Findhorn...

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.329
and he was one of Scotland's - well,
he was Scotland's greatest mathematician...

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.926
and he was one of the century's
great mathematicians.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.166
And he prided himself on the fact that
he had no fantasy life, no dream life -

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.891
nothing to stand be -
no imaginary life -

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.363
nothing to stand between him
and the direct perception of mathematics.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.485
And one day when he was in his mid-50s, he
was walking in the gardens of Edinburgh...

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.404
and he saw a faun.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.087
The faun was very surprised because fauns
have always been able to see people...

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.845
but you know,
very few people ever see them.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.571
You know, uh,
those little imaginary creatures.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.563
- Not a deer.
- Oh.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.928
- You call them fauns, don't you?
- I thought a fawn was a baby deer.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.249
Yeah, well, there's a deer that's called a
fawn, but these are like those little imagi -

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.891
- Oh! The kind that Debussy -
- Yes. Right.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.407
Well, so he got to know the faun,
and he got to know other fauns...

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.767
and a series of conversations began...

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.684
and more and more fauns would
come out every afternoon to meet him.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.683
And he'd have talks with the fauns.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.088
Then one day, after a while, when, you
know, they'd really gotten to know him...

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.680
they asked him
if he would like to meet Pan...

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.888
because Pan would like to meet him.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.042
And of course,
Pan was afraid of terrifying him...

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.726
because he knew
of the Christian misconception...

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.407
which portrayed Pan as an evil creature,
which he's not.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.450
But Roc said he would love to meet Pan,
and so they met...

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.251
and Pan indirectly sent him
on his way on a journey...

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.689
in which he met the other people
who began Findhorn.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.889
But Roc used to practice
certain exercises -

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.089
like, uh, for instance,
if he were right-handed...

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.481
all today he would do everything
with his left hand.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.325
All day - eating, writing,
everything - opening doors...

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.165
in order to break the habits of living.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.851
Because the great danger,
he felt, for him...

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.242
was to fall into a trance,
out of habit.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.848
He had a whole series of very simple
exercises that he had invented...

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.124
just to keep
seeing, feeling, remembering.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.168
Because you have to learn now.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.244
It didn't used to be necessary,
but today you have to learn something...

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.402
like, uh, are you really hungry...

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.563
or are you just stuffing your face -
[ Laughing ]

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.887
Because that's what you do,
out of habit?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.611
I mean, you can afford to do it,
so you do it...

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.648
whether you're hungry or not.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.564
You know, if you go to
the Buddhist Meditation Center...

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.086
they make you taste
each bite of your food...

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.846
so it takes two hours -
it's horrible - to eat your lunch.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.367
But you're conscious
of the taste of your food.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.683
If you're just eating out of habit,
then you don't taste the food...

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.650
and you're not conscious of the reality
of what's happening to you.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.802
You enter the dream world again.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.362
Now, do you think maybe
we live in this dream world...

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.842
because we do so many things every day
that affect us in ways...

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.322
that somehow
we're just not aware of?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.769
I mean, you know, I was thinking,
urn, last Christmas...

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.003
Debby and I were given
an electric blanket.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.847
I can tell you that it is just
such a marvelous advance...

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.528
- over our old way of life, and it is just great.
- [André Chuckling ]

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.002
But, uh, it is quite different
from not having an electric blanket...

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.004
and I sometimes sort of wonder,
well, what is it doing to me?

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.681
I mean, I sort of feel, uh,
I'm not sleeping quite in the same way.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.683
[ Chuckles ]
No, you wouldn't be.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.684
I mean, uh, and my dreams
are sort of different...

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.604
and I feel a little bit different
when I get up in the morning.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.202
I wouldn't put an electric blanket on
for anything.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:58.047
First, I'd be worried I might get electrocuted.
No, I don't trust technology.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.761
But I mean, the main thing, Wally, is
that I think that that kind of comfort...

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.969
just separates you from reality
in a very direct way.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.811
- You mean -
- I mean, if you don't have that electric blanket...

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.611
and your apartment is cold
and you need to put on another blanket...

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.127
or go into the closet and pile up coats
on top of the blankets you have...

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.402
well, then you know it's cold.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.721
And that sets up a link of things.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.361
You have compassion for the per -
Well, is the person next to you cold?

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.568
Are there other people in the world
who are cold?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.120
What a cold night!
I like the cold.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.647
My God, I never realized. I don't want a blanket.
It's fun being cold.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.088
I can snuggle up against you even more
because it's cold.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.766
All sorts of things occur to you.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.208
Turn on that electric blanket,
and it's like taking a tranquilizer...

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.760
or it's like being lobotomized
by watching television.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.842
I think you enter
the dream world again.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.649
I mean, what does it do to us, Wally,
living in an environment...

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.770
where something as massive
as the seasons, or winter, or cold...

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.968
don't in any way affect us?

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.042
I mean, we're animals, after all.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.043
I mean, what does that mean?

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:03.289
I think that means that instead
of living under the sun...

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.045
and the moon and the sky
and the stars...

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.964
we're living in a fantasy world
of our own making.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.362
Yeah, but I mean, I would never
give up my electric blanket, André.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.250
I mean, because New York
is cold in the winter.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.529
I mean, our apartment is cold.
It's a difficult environment.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.762
I mean, our lives
are tough enough as it is.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.362
I'm not looking for ways to get rid of the
few things that provide relief and comfort.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.284
I mean, on the contrary,
I'm looking for more comfort...

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.727
because, uh, the world is very abrasive.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.201
I mean, uh,
I'm trying to protect myself...

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.921
because, really, there are these abrasive
beatings to be avoided everywhere you look.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.005
But, Wally, don't you - don't you see
that comfort can be dangerous?

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.323
I mean, you like to be comfortable,
and I like to be comfortable too...

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.882
but comfort can lull you
into a dangerous tranquillity.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.010
I mean, my mother knew
a woman, Lady Hatfield...

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.208
who was one of the richest women
in the world...

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.568
and she died of starvation
because all she would eat was chicken.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.484
I mean, she just liked chicken, Wally,
and that was all she would eat.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.643
And actually her body was starving,
but she didn't know it...

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.321
'cause she was quite happy eating her
chicken, and so she finally died.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.610
See, I honestly believe
that we're all like Lady Hatfield now.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.651
We're having a lovely, comfortable time with
our electric blankets and our chicken...

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.611
and meanwhile we're starving because we're
so cut off from contact with reality...

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.526
that we're not getting any real sustenance,
'cause we don't see the world.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.523
We don't see ourselves.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.728
We don't see how our actions
affect other people.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.929
Have you read Martin Buber's book
<i>On</i> Hasidism?

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.247
- No.
- Well, here's a view of life.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.290
I mean, he talks about the belief
of the Hasidic Jews...

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.283
that there are spirits chained
in everything.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.283
There are spirits chained in you.
There are spirits chained in me.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:42.761
Well, there are spirits chained
in this table.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.767
And that prayer is the action of liberating
these enchained embryo-like spirits...

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.888
and that every action of ours in life...

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.042
whether it's, uh,
doing business, or making love...

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.087
or having dinner together,
or whatever -

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.810
that every action of ours
should be a prayer...

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.723
a sacrament in the world.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.406
Now, do you think we're living like that?

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.528
Why do you think
we're not living like that?

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.604
I think it's because if we allowed
ourselves to see what we do every day...

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.682
we might just find it too nauseating.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.728
I mean, the way we treat other people.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.407
You know, every day, several times a day,
I walk into my apartment building.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:19.006
The doorman calls me Mr. Gregory,
and I call him Jimmy.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.209
Already, what's the difference
between that...

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:25.090
and the Southern plantation owner
who's got slaves?

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.209
You see, I think that an act of murder
is committed in that moment...

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:30.247
when I walk into that building.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:34.529
Because here's a dignified, intelligent
man - a man of my own age -

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.207
and when I call him Jimmy, then he
becomes a child, and I'm an adult...

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.600
because I can buy my way
into the building.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.331
Right. That's right.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:47.291
I mean, my God,
when I was a Latin teacher...

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.488
I mean, people used to treat me -

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.370
I mean, uh, you know,
if I would go to a party...

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.330
of professional or literary people...

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.961
I mean, I was just treated, uh,
in the nicest sense of the word...

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.644
uh, like a dog.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.768
I mean, in other words,
there was no question...

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.521
of my being able to participate on an equal
basis in a conversation with people.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.080
I mean, you know, I'd occasionally
have conversations with people...

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.686
but then, uh,
when they asked what I did...

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.240
which would always happen
after about five minutes...

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.448
uh, you know, their faces -

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.360
Even if they were enjoying the conversation, or
they were flirting with me, or whatever it was -

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.847
their faces would just have that expression
just like the portcullis crashing down.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.322
You know, those medieval gates.
They would just walk away.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.768
I mean, I literally lived like a dog.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.401
And I mean, uh, when Debby was
working as a secretary, you know...

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.087
if she would tell people what she did,
they would just go insane.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.481
I mean, it would be just
as if she'd said, uh...

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.407
“Oh, well, I've been serving a life sentence
recently, uh, for child murdering.”

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.610
I mean, my God, you know, when you talk
about our attitudes toward other people...

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.922
I mean, I think of myself...

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.005
as just a very decent,
good person, you know...

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.447
just because I think
I'm reasonably friendly...

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.761
to most of the people
I happen to meet every day.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.525
I mean, I really think
of myself quite smugly.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.729
I just think I'm a perfectly nice guy,
uh, you know...

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.883
so long as I think of the world
as consisting of, you know...

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.770
just the small circle of the people
that I know as friends...

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.844
or the few people that we know in this
little world of our little hobbies -

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.849
the theater or whatever it is.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.043
And I'm really quite self-satisfied.
I'm just quite happy with myself.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.248
I just have no complaint about myself.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.322
I mean, you know, let's face it.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.200
I mean, there's a whole enormous world out
there that I just don't ever think about.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.569
I certainly don't take responsibility
for how I've lived in that world.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.405
I mean, you know, if I were actually
to sort of confront the fact...

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.682
that I'm sort of sharing this stage...

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.240
with-with-with this starving person
in Africa somewhere...

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.886
well, I wouldn't feel so great
about myself.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.682
So naturally I just - I just blot all those
people right out of my perception.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.889
So, of course -
of course, I'm ignoring...

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.328
a whole section of the real world.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.846
But frankly, you know...

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.324
when I write a play, in a way, one of the
things I guess I think I'm trying to do...

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.609
is I'm trying to bring myself up
against some little bits of reality...

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.809
and I'm trying to share that, uh,
with an audience.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.164
I mean - I mean,
of course we all know, uh...

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.766
the theater is, uh,
in terrible shape today.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.249
I mean, uh - I mean, at least a few years ago
people who really cared about the theater...

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.687
used to say, “The theater is dead.”

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.684
And now everybody's redefined
the theater in such a trivial way...

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.728
that, I mean - I mean, God...

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.964
I know people who are involved with
the theater who go to see things now that-

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.441
I mean, a few years ago
these same people...

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.410
would have just been embarrassed
to have even seen some of these plays.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.051
I mean, they would have just shrunk,
you know, just in horror...

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.327
at the superficiality of these things.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.006
But now they say,
“Oh, that was pretty good.”

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.082
it's just incredible.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.289
And I really just find that attitude
unbearable...

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.160
because I really do think the theater
can do something very important.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.121
I mean, I do think the theater can help
bring people in contact with reality.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.888
Now, now, you may not feel that at all.
You may just find that totally absurd.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.210
Yeah, but, Wally,
don't you see the dilemma?

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.325
You're not taking into account
the period we're living in.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.562
I mean, of course that's what
the theater should do.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.608
I mean, I've always felt that.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.082
You know, when I was a young director,
and I directed the Bacchae at Yale...

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.448
my impulse, when Pentheus has been
killed by his mother and the Furies...

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.171
and they pull the tree back,
and they tie him to the tree...

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.483
and fling him into the air, and he flies
through space and he's killed...

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.530
and they rip him to shreds
and I guess cut off his head -

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.286
my impulse was that the thing to do was
to get a head from the New Haven morgue...

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.328
and pass it around the audience.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.290
Now, I wanted Agawe
to bring on a real head...

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.840
and that this head should be
passed around the audience...

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.561
so that somehow people realized
that this stuff was real, see?

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.120
That it was real stuff.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.001
- Now, the actress playing Agawe absolutely refused to do it.
- [ Giggling ]

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.208
You know, Gordon Craig
used to talk about...

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.490
why is there gold or silver in the churches
or something - the great cathedrals -

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.121
when actors could be wearing
gold and silver?

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.921
And I mean, people who saw Eleonora Duse in
the last couple of years of her life, Wally -

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.368
people said that it was like
seeing light on stage, or mist...

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.442
or the essence of something.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.205
I mean, then when you think
about Bertolt Brecht-

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.409
He somehow created a theater
in which people could observe...

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.721
that was vastly entertaining
and exciting...

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.883
but in which the excitement
didn't overwhelm you.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.204
He somehow allowed you the distance
between the play and yourself...

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.244
that, in fact, two human beings need
in order to live together.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.370
You know, the question is whether
the theater now can do for an audience...

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.808
what Brecht tried to do
or what Craig or Duse tried to do.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.803
Can it do it now?

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.248
'Cause, you see, I think that
people today are so deeply asleep...

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.005
that unless, you know, you're putting on
those sort of superficial plays...

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.321
that just help your audience
to sleep more comfortably...

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.210
it's very hard to know
what to do in the theater.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.203
<i>[ People Chattering, Laughing]</i>

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.922
Because, you see, I think that if you
put on serious, contemporary plays...

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.923
by writers like yourself...

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.685
you may only be helping to deaden
the audience in a different way.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.331
What do you mean?

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.488
Well, I mean, Wally...

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.928
how does it affect an audience
to put on one of these plays...

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.970
in which you show that people
are totally isolated now...

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.283
and they can't reach each other,
and their lives are desperate?

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.762
Or how does it affect them to see a play
that shows that our world...

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.050
is full of nothing but shocking
sexual events, and terror, and violence?

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.407
Does that help to wake up
a sleeping audience?

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.609
See, I don't think so,
'cause I think it's very likely...

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.809
that the picture of the world that you're
showing them in a play like that...

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.929
is exactly the picture of the world
they have already.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.810
I mean, you know, they know
their own lives and relationships...

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.882
are difficult and painful.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.122
And if they watch the evening news
on television...

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.409
well, there what they see
is a terrifying, chaotic universe...

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.530
full of rapes and murders
and hands cut off by subway cars...

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.127
and children pushing their parents
out of windows.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.528
So the play tells them that
their impression of the world is correct...

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.602
and that there's absolutely no way out.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.603
There's nothing they can do.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.650
And they end up feeling
passive and impotent.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.200
I mean, look - look at something
like that christening...

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.601
that my group arranged for me
in the forest in Poland.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.684
Well, there was an example of something that
really had all the elements of theater.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.009
It was worked on carefully.
It was thought about carefully.

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.447
It was done with
exquisite taste and magic.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.682
And they, in fact, created something...

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.526
which, in this case, was, in a way,
just for an audience of one - just for me.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.525
But they created something
that had ritual, love, surprise...

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.568
denouement,
beginning, a middle and end...

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.928
and was an incredibly beautiful
piece of theater.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.241
And the impact that it had
on its audience - on me -

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.641
was somehow a totally positive one.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.246
It didn't deaden me.
It brought me to life.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.361
Yeah, but I mean, are you saying
that it's impossible -

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.604
I mean, uh - I mean -
I mean, uh, isn't it a little upsetting...

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.526
to come to the conclusion that there's
no way to wake people up anymore...

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.924
except to involve them in some kind
of a strange, uh, christening in Poland...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.606
or some kind of a strange experience
on top of Mount Everest?

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:11.049
I mean, uh, because, uh,
you know that the awful thing is...

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.361
if you really say that
it's-it's necessary...

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.006
to, uh, take everybody to, uh, Everest...

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.051
it's really tough, because everybody
can't be taken to Everest.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.440
I mean, there must have been periods in
history when it would have been possible...

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.450
to, uh, save the patient
through less drastic measures.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.201
I mean, there must have been periods
when in order to give people...

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.242
a strong or meaningful experience...

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.290
you wouldn't actually have to
take them to Everest.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.681
But you do now.
In some way or other, you do now.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.570
You know, there was a time when you
could have just, for instance, written...

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.087
<i>I don't</i> know,
<i>uh, Sense and Sensibility</i> by <i>Jane Austen.</i>

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.846
And I'm sure the people who read it had a
pretty strong experience. I'm sure they did.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.605
I mean, all right, now you're saying
that people today wouldn't get it.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.321
Maybe that's true. But I mean, isn't there
any kind of writing or any kind of a play -

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.926
I mean, isn't it still legitimate
for writers...

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.243
to try to portray reality
so that people can see it?

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.445
I mean, really, tell me, why do we
require a trip to Mount Everest...

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.841
in order to be able to perceive
one moment of reality?

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.764
I mean - I mean, is Mount Everest
more real than New York?

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.888
I mean, isn't New York real?

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.124
I mean, you see, I think if you
could become fully aware...

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.647
of what existed in the cigar store
next door to this restaurant...

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.722
I think it would just
blow your brains out.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.320
I mean - I mean, isn't there
just as much reality to be perceived...

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.402
in a cigar store
as there is on Mount Everest?

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.130
I mean, what do you think?

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.885
I think that not only is there nothing
more real about Mount Everest...

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.008
I think there's nothing that different,
in a certain way.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.651
I mean, because reality
is uniform, in a way...

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.688
so that if your -
if your perceptions are -

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.604
I mean, if your own mechanism
is operating correctly...

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.968
it would become irrelevant to go
to Mount Everest, and sort of absurd...

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.884
because, I mean - it just -
I mean, of course, on some level, I mean...

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.601
obviously it's very different
from a cigar store on 7th Avenue.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.889
- But I mean -
- Well, I agree with you, Wally.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.645
But the problem is that people
can't see the cigar store now.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.246
I mean, things don't affect people
the way they used to.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.721
I mean, it may very well be
that 10 years from now...

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.571
people will pay $10,000 in cash
to be castrated...

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.325
just in order to be affected by something.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.003
Well, why - why do you think that is?
I mean, why is that?

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.608
I mean, is it just because people
are lazy today, or they're bored?

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.809
I mean, are we just
like bored, spoiled children...

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.406
who've just been lying
in the bathtub all day...

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.801
just playing with their plastic duck...

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.282
and now they're just thinking,
“Well, what can I do?”

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.570
Okay. Yes. We're bored.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.642
We're all bored now.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.927
But has it ever occurred to you, Wally,
that the process...

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.520
that creates this boredom
that we see in the world now...

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.049
may very well be a self-perpetuating,
unconscious form of brainwashing...

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.363
created by a world totalitarian government
based on money...

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.091
and that all of this is much more dangerous
than one thinks...

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.050
and it's not just a question
of individual survival, Wally...

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.566
but that somebody who's bored
is asleep...

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.769
and somebody who's asleep
will not say no?

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.684
See, I keep meeting these people -
I mean, uh, just a few days ago...

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.728
I met this man whom I greatly admire.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.087
He's a Swedish physicist.
Gustav Björnstrand.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.731
And he told me that he
no longer watches television...

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.724
he doesn't read newspapers,
and he doesn't read magazines.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.121
He's completely
cut them out of his life...

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.683
because he really does feel that we're living
in some kind of Orwellian nightmare now...

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.810
and that everything that you hear now
contributes to turning you into a robot.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.561
<i>And when I was at Findhorn, I met
this extraordinary English tree expert...</i>

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.768
who had devoted his life
to saving trees.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.241
Just got back from Washington,
lobbying to save the redwoods.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.164
He's 84 years old,
and he always travels with a backpack...

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.242
'cause he never knows
where he's gonna be tomorrow.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.324
And when I met him at Findhorn,
he said to me, “Where are you from?”

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:42.449
I said, “New York.” He said, “Ah, New York.
Yes, that's a very interesting place.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.485
Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about
the fact that they want to leave, but never do?”

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.166
And I said, “Oh, yes.” And he said,
“Why do you think they don't leave?”

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:53.211
I gave him different banal theories. He said,
“Oh, I don't think it's that way at all.”

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.842
He said, “I think that New York is the new
model for the new concentration camp...

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.400
“where the camp has been built
by the inmates themselves...

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:04.087
“and the inmates are the guards, and they
have this pride in this thing they've built.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.083
“They've built their own prison.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.162
“And so they exist
in a state of schizophrenia...

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.163
“where they are both guards
and prisoners.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.608
“And as a result, they no longer have -
having been lobotomized -

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.121
“the capacity to leave
the prison they've made...

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.090
or to even see it as a prison.”

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.369
And then he went into his pocket,
and he took out a seed for a tree...

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.448
and he said, “This is a pine tree.”

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.127
He put it in my hand and he said,
“Escape before it's too late.”

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.006
<i>See, actually,
for two or three years now...</i>

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.444
Chiquita and I have had this very unpleasant
feeling that we really should get out.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.330
We really feel like Jews in Germany
in the late '30s.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.323
Get out of here.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.482
Of course, the problem is
where to go.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.407
'Cause it seems quite obvious that the
whole world is going in the same direction.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.643
See, I think it's quite possible
that the 1960s...

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:58.488
represented the last burst of the human
being before he was extinguished...

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.285
and that this is the beginning
of the rest of the future, now...

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.490
and that from now on there'll simply be
all these robots walking around...

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.847
feeling nothing, thinking nothing.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.890
And there'll be nobody left almost
to remind them...

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.282
that there once was a species
called a human being...

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.362
with feelings and thoughts...

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.284
and that history and memory
are right now being erased...

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.284
and soon nobody
will really remember...

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.601
that life existed on the planet.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.689
Now, of course, Björnstrand feels
that there's really almost no hope...

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.162
and that we're probably
going back to a very savage...

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.289
lawless, terrifying period.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.840
Findhorn people
see it a little differently.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.764
They're feeling that there'll be
these pockets of light...

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.922
springing up
in different parts of the world...

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.369
and that these will be, in a way,
invisible planets on this planet...

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.920
and that as we, or the world,
grow colder...

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.641
we can take invisible space journeys
to these different planets...

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.202
refuel for what it is we need to do
on the planet itself...

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.567
and come back.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.564
And it's their feeling that
there have to be centers now...

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.964
where people can come and reconstruct
a new future for the world.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.080
And when I was talking
to, uh, Gustav Björnstrand...

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.363
he was saying that actually these centers
are growing up everywhere now...

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.444
and that what they're trying to do,
which is what Findhorn was trying to do...

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.761
and, in a way, what I was trying to do -

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.207
I mean,
these things can't be given names...

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.524
but in a way, these are all attempts
at creating a new kind of school...

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.807
or a new kind of monastery.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.406
And Björnstrand talks about
the concept of “reserves” -

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.245
islands of safety where history
can be remembered...

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.931
and the human being
can continue to function...

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.686
in order to maintain the species
through a dark age.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.121
In other words, we're talking
about an underground...

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.806
which did exist in a different way
during the Dark Ages...

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.611
among the mystical orders
of the church.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.842
And the purpose of this underground...

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:58.131
is to find out how to preserve
the light, life, the culture...

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.647
<i>how to keep things living.</i>

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.644
You see, I keep thinking
that what we need...

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.564
is a new language -

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.802
a language of the heart...

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.805
a language, as in the Polish forest,
where language wasn't needed.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:18.841
Some kind of language between people
that is a new kind of poetry...

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.482
that's the poetry of the dancing bee
that tells us where the honey is.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.643
And I think that in order
to create that language...

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.281
you're going to have to learn how
you can go through a looking glass...

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.328
into another kind of perception...

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.327
where you have that sense
of being united to all things...

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.643
and suddenly you understand everything.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.761
<i>[ Siren Wailing In Distance]</i>

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.047
Are you ready for some dessert?

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.282
Uh, I think I'll just have an espresso.
Thank you.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.371
- Very good.
- I'll - I'll also have one. Thank you.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.728
And - And, uh, could I also
have, uh, an amaretto?

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.485
Certainly, sir.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.688
Thank you.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.049
You see, Wally, there's this incredible
building that they built at Findhorn.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.726
And the man who designed it
had never designed anything in his life.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.768
He wrote children's books.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.043
And some people wanted it to be
a sort of hall of meditation...

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.521
and others wanted it to be
a kind of lecture hall.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.730
But the psychic part of the community wanted
it to serve another function as well...

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.407
because they wanted it to be a kind of
spaceship which at night could rise up...

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.285
and let the U.F.O.'s know that this
was a safe place to land...

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.362
and that they would find friends there.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.201
So, the problem was -
'cause it needed a massive kind of roof-

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.403
was how to have a roof
that would stay on the building...

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.927
but at the same time be able to fly up
at night and meet the flying saucers.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.765
So, the architect
meditated and meditated...

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.684
and he finally came up with
the very simple solution...

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.081
of not actually joining the roof
to the building...

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.162
which means that it should fall off...

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.403
because they have great gales
up in northern Scotland.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.007
So, to keep it from falling off,
he got beach stones from the beach -

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.890
or we did,
'cause I-l worked on this building -

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.042
all up and down the roof,
just like that.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.409
And the idea was that the energy
that would flow from stone to stone...

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.522
would be so strong, you see...

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.922
that it would keep the roof down
under any conditions...

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.528
but at the same time, if the roof needed to
go up, it would be light enough to go up.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.286
Well - [ Chuckling ]
it works, you see.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.931
Now, architects
don't know why it works...

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.002
and it shouldn't work,
'cause it should fall off.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.043
But it works. It does work.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.806
The gales blow, and the roof should
fall off, but it doesn't fall off.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.929
<i>[ Man Coughing]</i>

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.403
Yep.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.403
Well, uh...

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.251
do you want to know
my actual response to all this?

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.687
- Do you want to hear my actual response?
- Yes!

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.721
See, my actual response -
I mean -

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.886
[ Laughing ] I mean - I mean,
I'm just trying to - to survive, you know?

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.123
I mean,
I'm just trying to earn a living...

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.851
just trying to pay my rent and my bills.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.321
I mean, uh -

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.768
Ah, I live my life.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.923
I enjoy staying home with Debby.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.850
I'm reading Charlton Heston's
autobiography.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.610
And that's that.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.604
I mean, you know -
I mean, occasionally, maybe...

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.163
Debby and I will step outside,
we'll go to a party or something.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.687
And if I can occasionally get my little
talent together and write a little play...

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:33.001
well, then that's just -
that's just wonderful.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.050
And I mean, I enjoy reading about
other little plays people have written...

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.522
and reading the reviews of those plays
and what people said about them...

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.809
and what people said
about what people said.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.369
And I mean, I have - I have a list of errands
and responsibilities that I keep in a notebook.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.920
I enjoy going through the notebook...

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.446
carrying out the responsibilities,
doing the errands...

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.683
and crossing them off the list.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.243
And, I mean, I just - I just don't know
how anybody could enjoy anything more...

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.689
than I enjoy, uh, reading
Charlton Heston's autobiography...

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.610
or, uh, you know, uh,
getting up in the morning...

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.207
and having the cup of cold coffee
that's been waiting for me all night...

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.806
still there for me
to drink in the morning...

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.282
and no cockroach or fly
has-has died in it overnight.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.045
I mean, I'm just so thrilled
when I get up...

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.647
and I see that coffee there,
just the way I wanted it.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.007
I mean, I just can't imagine...

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.686
how anybody could enjoy something else
any more than that.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.606
I mean - I mean, obviously, if the cockroach
- If there is a dead cockroach in it...

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.490
well, then I just have a feeling
of disappointment, and I'm sad.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.723
But I mean, I - I just-
I just don't think...

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.087
I feel the need for anything more
than all this.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.766
Whereas, you know,
you seem to be saying...

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:46.804
that, uh...

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.248
it's inconceivable that anybody could
be having a meaningful life today...

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.482
and, you know,
everyone is totally destroyed...

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.166
and we all need to live
in these outposts.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:57.925
But I mean, you know,
I just can't believe - even for you -

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.322
I mean, don't you find - isn't it pleasant
just to get up in the morning...

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.887
<i>and there's Chiquita,
there are the children...</i>

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.440
and The Times is delivered,
you can read it.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.410
I mean, maybe you'll direct a play,
maybe you won't direct a play.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.086
But forget about the play
that you may or may not direct.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.762
Why is it necessary to - Why not lean back
and just enjoy these details?

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.448
I mean, and there'd be a delicious cup
of coffee and a piece of coffeecake.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.205
I mean, why is it necessary
to have more than this...

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.601
or to even think about
having more than this?

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.048
I mean, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.971
I mean - I mean,
I know what you're talking about...

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.884
but I don't really know
what you're talking about.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.169
And I mean, you know, even if I were
to totally agree with you, you know...

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.483
and even if I were to accept the idea
that there's just no way for anybody...

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.642
to have personal happiness now...

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.087
well, you know,
I still couldn't accept the idea...

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.811
that the way to make life wonderful
would be to just totally...

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.247
you know,
reject Western civilization...

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.642
and fall back into some kind of belief
in some kind of weird something -

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.166
I mean, I don't even know how
to begin talking about this...

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.608
but you know, in the Middle Ages...

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.287
before the arrival of
scientific thinking as we know it today...

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.647
well, people could believe anything.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.371
Anything could be true -
the statue of the Virgin Mary...

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.522
could speak or bleed
or whatever it was.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.648
But the wonderful thing
that happened...

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.690
was that then in the development
of science in the Western world...

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.527
certain things did come slowly
to be known and understood.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.171
I mean, you know...

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.722
obviously, all ideas in science
are constantly being revised.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.723
I mean, that's the whole point.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.806
But we do at least know that the universe
has some shape and order...

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:42.408
and that, uh, you know, trees do not
turn into people or goddesses...

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.801
and there are very good reasons
why they don't...

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.201
and you can't just believe
absolutely anything.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.203
Whereas, the things
that you're talking about-

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.841
I mean - I mean, you found
the handprint in the book...

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.891
and there were - there were three Andres
and one Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.770
And to me that is a coincidence.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.810
But - And-And then, you know,
the people who put that book together...

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.121
well, they had their own reasons
for putting it together.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.403
But to you it was significant, as if that
book had been written 40 years ago...

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:12.485
so that you would see it,
as if it was planned for you, in a way.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.642
I mean, really - I mean -

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.282
I mean, all right, let's say, if I get
a fortune cookie in a Chinese restaurant...

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.408
I mean, of course,
even I have a tendency -

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.290
I mean, you know - I mean, of course,
I would hardly throw it out.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.364
I mean, I read it.
I read it, and - and, uh -

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.683
I just instinctively sort of-
You know, if it says something like, uh...

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:34.401
“A conversation with a dark-haired man
will be very important for you”...

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.529
well, I just instinctively think, you know,
“Who do I know who has dark hair?

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.410
Did we have a conversation?
What did we talk about?”

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.804
In other words, uh, there's something
in me that makes me read it...

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.566
and I instinctively interpret it
as if it were an omen of the future.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.167
But in my conscious opinion, which is
so fundamental to my whole view of life -

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.449
I mean, I would just have to change totally
to not have this opinion.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.560
In my conscious opinion,
this is simply something...

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.764
that was written in the cookie factory several
years ago and in no way refers to me.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.605
I mean, you know,
the - the fact that I got it-

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.445
I mean, the man who wrote it
did not know anything about me.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.568
I mean, he could not have known
anything about me.

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.291
There's no way that this cookie
could actually have to do with me.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.966
And the fact that I've gotten it
is just basically a joke.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.850
And I mean, if I were gonna go
on a trip on an airplane...

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:19.968
and I got a fortune cookie
that said “Don't go”...

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.806
I mean, of course, I admit I might feel
a bit nervous for about one second.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.360
But in fact, I would go because,
I mean...

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.920
that trip is gonna be successful
or unsuccessful...

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.651
based on the state of the airplane
and the state of the pilot.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.485
And the cookie is in no position
to know about that.

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.483
And I mean, you know, it's the same...

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.325
with any kind of, uh, prophecy,
or a sign, or an omen.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.803
Because if you believe in omens,
then that means that the universe -

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.326
I mean, I don't even know how
to begin to describe this.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:49.847
That means that the future
is somehow sending messages...

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.042
backwards to the present.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.442
Which-Which means that the future
must exist in some sense already...

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.444
in order to be able
to send these messages.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.770
And it also means that things in the universe
are there for a purpose - to give us messages.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.241
Whereas I think that things
in the universe are just there.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.209
I mean, they don't mean anything.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.848
I mean, you know, if the turtle's egg falls out
of the tree and splashes on the paving stones...

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.003
it's just because that turtle was clumsy -
by accident.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.165
And-And to decide whether to send
my ships off to war on the basis of that...

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.362
seems a big mistake to me.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.047
Well, what information would
you send your ships to war on?

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.844
Because if it's all meaningless...

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.968
what's the difference whether
you accept the fortune cookie...

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.128
or the statistics
of the Ford Foundation?

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.202
It doesn't seem to matter.

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.410
Well, the meaningless fact of the
fortune cookie or the turtle's egg...

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.280
can't possibly have any relevance
to the subject you're analyzing.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.603
Whereas a group of meaningless facts
that are collected and interpreted...

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.122
in a scientific way
may quite possibly be relevant.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.921
Because the wonderful thing
about scientific theories about things...

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.646
is that they're based on experiments
that can be repeated.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.648
Hmm.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.648
Well, it's true, Wally.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.451
I mean, you know,
following omens and so on...

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.285
is probably just a way
of letting ourselves off the hook...

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.729
so that we don't have to take individual
responsibility for our own actions.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.087
But I mean, giving yourself over
to the unconscious...

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.530
can leave you vulnerable to all sorts
of very frightening manipulation.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.922
And in all the work that I was involved in,
there was always that danger.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.607
And there was always that question
of tampering with people's lives...

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.321
because if I lead one of these workshops,
then I do become partly a doctor...

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.528
and partly a therapist,
and partly a priest.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.003
And I'm not a doctor,
or a therapist, or a priest.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.691
And already some
of these new monasteries...

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.366
or communities or whatever
we've been talking about...

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.488
are becoming institutionalized...

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.769
and I guess even in a way, at times,
sort of fascistic.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.965
You know, there's a sort of self-satisfied
elitist paranoia that grows up -

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.089
a feeling of “them” and “us” -
that is very unsettling.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.370
But I mean, uh, the thing is, Wally, I think
it's the exaggerated worship of science...

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.442
that has led us into this situation.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.131
I mean, science has been held up to us
as a magical force...

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.202
that would somehow solve everything.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.521
Well, quite the contrary.
It's done quite the contrary.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.602
It's destroyed everything.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.648
So that is what has really led,
I think...

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.725
to this very strong, deep reaction
against science that we're seeing now...

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.531
just as the Nazi demons that were
released in the '30s in Germany...

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.446
were probably a reaction against
a certain oppressive kind of knowledge...

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.000
and culture and rational thinking.

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:42.607
So I agree that we're talking about
something potentially very dangerous.

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.968
But modern science has not been
particularly less dangerous.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.008
Right. Well, I agree with you.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.082
I completely agree.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.366
No, you know, the truth is...

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.650
I think I do know what really disturbs me
about the work you've described...

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.690
and I don't even know if I can express it.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.691
But somehow it seems that the whole point of
the work that you did in those workshops...

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.685
when you get right down to it
and you ask what was it really about-

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.728
The whole point, really, I think...

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.963
was to enable the people in the workshops,
including yourself...

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.449
to somehow sort of strip away
every scrap of purposefulness...

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.091
from certain selected moments.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.403
And the point of it was so that you would
then all be able to experience...

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.643
somehow just pure being.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.725
In other words, you were trying to discover what
it would be like to live for certain moments...

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.883
without having any particular thing
that you were supposed to be doing.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.327
And I think
I just simply object to that.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.563
I mean, I just don't think I accept the
idea that there should be moments...

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.802
in which you're not trying
to do anything.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.885
<i>[ Chuckling ] I think, uh,
it's our nature, uh, to do things.</i>

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.883
I think we should do things.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.088
I think that, uh, purposefulness...

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.569
is part of our ineradicable
basic human structure.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.450
And to say that we ought to
be able to live without it...

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.525
is like saying that, uh, a tree ought to
be able to live without branches or roots.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.331
But - But actually, without branches
or roots, it wouldn't be a tree.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.244
I mean, it would just be a log.
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.004
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.448
I mean, in other words, if I'm sitting
at home and I have nothing to do...

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.443
well, I naturally reach for a book.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.241
I mean, what would be so great about
just sitting there and, uh, doing nothing?

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.243
It just seems absurd.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.970
And if Debby is there?

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.083
Well, that's just the same thing.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.084
I mean, is there really
such a thing as, uh...

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.085
two people doing nothing
but just being together?

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.202
I mean, would they simply then...

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.363
be, uh, “relating,”
to use the word we're always using?

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.363
I mean, what would that mean?

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.442
I mean, either we're
gonna have a conversation...

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.648
or we're going to, uh,
carry out the garbage...

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:49.327
or we're going to do something,
separately or together.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.323
I mean, do you see what I'm saying?

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.291
I mean, what does it mean
to just, uh, simply, uh, sit there?

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.681
That makes you nervous.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.203
Well, well, why shouldn't it make me nervous?
It just seems ridiculous to me.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.282
That's interesting, Wally.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.206
You know, when I went to Ladakh in western
Tibet and stayed on a farm for a month...

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.251
well, there, you know, when people come over
in the evening for tea, nobody says anything.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.448
Unless there's something to say,
but there almost never is.

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.081
So they just sit there and drink their tea,
and it doesn't seem to bother them.

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.803
I mean, you see, the trouble, Wally, with
always being active and doing things...

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.043
is that I think it's quite possible
to do all sorts of things...

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.522
and at the same time
be completely dead inside.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.046
I mean, you're doing all these things,
but are you doing them...

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.248
because you really feel
an impulse to do them...

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.085
or are you doing them mechanically,
as we were saying before?

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.811
Because I really do believe
that if you're just living mechanically...

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.121
then you have to change your life.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.204
I mean, you know, when you're young,
you go out on dates all the time.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.204
You go dancing or something.
You're floating free.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.483
And then one day suddenly
you find yourself in a relationship...

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.688
and suddenly everything freezes.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:58.570
And this can be true
in your work as well.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.484
And I mean, of course,
if you're really alive inside...

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.528
then of course there's no problem.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.841
I mean, if you're living with somebody
in one little room...

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.770
and there's a life going on between you
and the person you're living with...

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.363
well, then a whole adventure
can be going on right in that room.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.047
But there's always the danger
that things can go dead.

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.727
Then I really do think you have to kind of
become a hobo or something, you know...

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.962
like Kerouac,
and go out on the road.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.202
I really believe that.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.171
You know, it's not that wonderful
to spend your life on the road.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.802
My own overwhelming preference
is to stay in that room if you can.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.089
But you know, if you live with somebody for a
long time, people are constantly saying...

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.841
“Well, of course it's not as great
as it used to be, but that's only natural.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.402
The first blush of a romance goes,
and that's the way it has to be.”

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.643
Now, I totally disagree with that.

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.448
But I do think that you have to constantly ask
yourself the question, with total frankness:

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.648
ls your marriage still a marriage?

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.927
Is the sacramental element there?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.681
Just as you have to ask about
the sacramental element in your work -

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.087
Is it still there?

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.845
I mean, it's a very frightening thing,
Wally, to have to suddenly realize...

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.164
that, my God, I thought I was living my life,
but in fact I haven't been a human being.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.163
I've been a performer.

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.481
I haven't been living. I've been acting.
I've - I've acted the role of the father.

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.081
I've acted the role of the husband.
I've acted the role of the friend.

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.607
I've acted the role of the writer,
or director, or what have you.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:25.571
I've lived in the same room with this
person, but I haven't really seen them.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.690
I haven't really heard them.
I haven't really been with them.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.445
Yeah, I know some people
are just sometimes...

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:35.171
uh, existing just side by side.

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.167
I mean, uh, the other person's, uh, face
could just turn into a great wolf's face...

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.084
and, uh, it just wouldn't be noticed.

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.482
And it wouldn't be noticed, no.
It wouldn't be noticed.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.962
I mean, when I was in Israel
a little while ago -

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.691
I mean, I have this picture of Chiquita
that was taken when she -

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:56.401
I always carry it with me. It was taken
when she was about 26 or something.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.324
And it's in summer,
and she's stretched out on a terrace...

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.324
in this sort of old-fashioned long skirt
that's kind of pulled up.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.880
And she's slim and sensual
and beautiful.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.369
And I've always looked at that picture and
just thought about just how sexy she looks.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.807
And then last year in Israel,
I looked at the picture...

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.204
and I realized that that face in the
picture was the saddest face in the world.

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.363
That girl at that time was just lost...

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.408
so sad and so alone.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.081
I've been carrying this picture for years and
not ever really seeing what it is, you know.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:28.323
I just never really
looked at the picture.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.689
And then, at a certain point, I realized I'd
just gone for a good 18 years unable to feel...

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.967
except in the most extreme situations.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.044
I mean, to some extent, I still had
the ability to live in my work.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.043
That was why I was such a work junkie.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.364
That was why I felt that every play that I
did was a matter of my life or my death.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.647
But in my real life, I was dead.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.326
<i>I was a robot.</i>

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.370
I mean, I didn't even allow myself
to get angry or annoyed.

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.205
I mean, you know, today
Chiquita, Nicolas, Marina -

01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.211
All clay long, as people do, they do things that
annoy me and they say things that annoy me.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.045
And today I get annoyed.
And they say, “Why are you annoyed?”

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.282
And I say, “Because you're annoying,”
you know.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:10.201
And when I allowed myself
to consider the possibility...

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.886
of not spending
the rest of my life with Chiquita...

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.681
I realized that what I wanted most in life
was to always be with her.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.448
But at that time, I hadn't learned what
it would be like to let yourself react...

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.443
to another human being.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.568
And if you can't react
to another person...

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.803
then there's no possibility
of action or interaction.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.966
And if there isn't, I don't really know
what the word “love” means...

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.841
except duty, obligation,
sentimentality, fear.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.851
I mean -
[Chuckling ]

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.888
I don't know about you, Wally, but I -

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.010
I just had to put myself into a kind of training
program to learn how to be a human being.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.242
I mean, how did I feel about anything?
I didn't know.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:57.729
What kind of things did I like? What kind of
people did I really want to be with? You know?

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:00.201
And the only way
that I could think of to find out...

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.285
was to just cut out all the noise
and stop performing all the time...

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.682
and just listen to what was inside me.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.764
See, I think a time comes
when you need to do that.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.923
Now, maybe in order to do it,
you have to go to the Sahara...

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.042
and maybe you can do it at home.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.487
But you need to cut out the noise.

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.603
<i>[ Car Horn Honks On Street]</i>

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.648
Yeah. Of course, personally,
I-l just, uh -

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.446
I usually don't, uh - [ Chuckles ]
like those quiet moments, you know.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.170
I really don't.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:34.962
I mean, uh, I don't know if
it's that, uh, Freudian thing or what-

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.771
But, uh, you know, the fear
of unconscious impulses...

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.003
or my own aggression
or whatever, but, uh...

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:44.801
if things get too quiet, and I find myself
just, uh, sitting there...

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.848
you know,
as we were saying before...

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.562
I mean, whether I'm by myself,
or-or I'm-I'm with someone else...

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.723
I just, uh -
I just have this feeling of...

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.850
uh, my God,
I'm going to be revealed.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.124
In other words, I'm adequate
to do any sort of a task, urn...

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.171
but I'm not adequate, uh,
just to - to be a human being.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.163
I mean, in other words, I'm not, uh -

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.528
If I'm just, uh, trapped there
and I'm not allowed to do things...

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.042
but all I can do is just,
urn, be there...

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.361
well, I'll just fail.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.482
I mean, in other words, uh...

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.961
I can pass any other sort of a test...

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.840
and, you know, I can even get an “A”
if I put in the required effort...

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.048
but I just don't, uh -

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.851
I just don't have a clue
how to pass this test.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.367
I mean - I mean, of course,
I realize this isn't a test...

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.205
but, urn, I see it as a test...

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.328
and I feel I'm going to fail it.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.368
I mean, it's - it's very scary.

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:46.684
I just feel, uh, just totally at sea.
I mean -

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.246
Well, you know,
I could imagine a life, Wally...

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.121
in which each day would become
an incredible, monumental, creative task...

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.362
and we're not necessarily up to it.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.922
I mean, if you felt like walking out on
the person you live with, you'd walk out.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.002
Then if you felt like it,
you'd come back.

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.766
But meanwhile, the other person
would have reacted to your walking out.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.083
It would be a life of such feeling.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.527
I mean, what was amazing
in the workshops I led...

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.241
was how quickly people seemed
to fall into enthusiasm...

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.644
celebration, joy, wonder,
abandon, wildness, tenderness.

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.882
Could we stand to live like that?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.004
Yeah, I think it's that moment of contact
with another person.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.003
I mean, that's what scares us.

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.482
I mean, that moment of being
face to face with another person.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.483
I mean, now -
[Laughs]

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.849
You wouldn't think it would be so frightening.
It's strange that we find it so frightening.

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.843
Well, it isn't that strange.

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:42.083
I mean, first of all, there are some
pretty good reasons for being frightened.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:46.529
I mean, you know, the human being
is a complex and dangerous creature.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.285
I mean, really,
if you start living each moment?

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.283
Christ, that's quite a challenge.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.967
I mean, if you really reach out and you're
really in touch with the other person...

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.522
well, that really is something
to strive for, I think, I really do.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.251
Yeah, it's just so pathetic
if one doesn't do that.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.763
Of course there's a problem, because the closer
you come, I think, to another human being...

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.963
the more completely mysterious -
and unreachable -

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.963
that person becomes.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.681
I mean, you know, you have to reach out,
you have to go back and forth with them...

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:18.765
and you have to relate, and yet you're
relating to a ghost or something.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.808
I don't know,
because we're ghosts.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.680
We're phantoms.
Who are we?

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.650
And that's to face, to confront the fact
that you're completely alone.

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.485
And to accept that you're alone
is to accept death.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.803
You mean, because somehow when you
are alone, you're alone with death.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.124
I mean, nothing's obstructing your
view of it, or something like that.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.964
<i>Right.</i>

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.004
You know, if I understood it correctly,
I think, uh, Heidegger said...

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.324
that, uh, if you were to experience
your own being to the full...

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:52.361
you'd be experiencing the decay
of that being toward death...

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.841
as a part of your experience.

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:58.083
You know, in the sexual act there's
that moment of complete forgetting...

01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.844
which is so incredible.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.161
Then in the next moment,
you start to think about things:

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.487
work on the play,
what you've got to do tomorrow.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.007
I don't know if this is true of you,
but I think it must be quite common.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.606
The world comes in quite fast.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.162
Now, that again may be because we're afraid
to stay in that place of forgetting...

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.362
because that, again, is close to death.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.807
Like people
who are afraid to go to sleep.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.771
In other words, you interrelate, and you
don't know what the next moment will bring.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.842
And to not know
what the next moment will bring...

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.048
brings you closer
to a perception of death.

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.761
<i>You see, that's why I think
that people have affairs.</i>

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.281
I mean, you know, in the theater,
if you get good reviews...

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.806
you feel for a moment
that you've got your hands on something.

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.087
You know what I mean?
I mean, it's a good feeling.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.481
But then that feeling goes quite quickly.

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.882
And once again you don't know
quite what you should do next.

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.644
What'll happen?

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.246
Well, have an affair,
and up to a certain point...

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.051
you can really feel
that you're on firm ground, you know.

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.727
There's a sexual conquest to be made.
There are different questions.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.723
Does she enjoy the ears being nibbled?

01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.367
How intensely can you talk about Schopenhauer
at some elegant French restaurant?

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.807
<i>Whatever nonsense it is.</i>

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.885
It's all, I think, to give you the
semblance that there's firm earth.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.971
Well, have a real relationship
with a person that goes on for years -

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.691
That's completely unpredictable.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.048
Then you've cut off all your ties to the
land, and you're sailing into the unknown...

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.566
into uncharted seas.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.368
I mean, you know, people hold on to these
images of father, mother, husband, wife...

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.363
again for the same reason -

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.967
'cause they seem to provide
some firm ground.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.407
But there's no wife there.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.528
What does that mean?
A wife.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.331
A husband. A son.

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.402
A baby holds your hands...

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.121
and then suddenly there's this huge man
lifting you off the ground...

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.123
and then he's gone.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.168
Where's that son?

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.330
<i>[ Wally Narrating ]All the other customers
seemed to have left hours ago.</i>

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.644
<i>We got the bill,
and André paid for our dinner.</i>

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.210
Really?

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.689
[ Conversing, indistinct]

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.767
<i>[ Wally Narrating]
I treated myself to a taxi.</i>

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.726
<i>I rode home through the city streets.</i>

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.605
<i>There wasn't a street
there wasn't a building...</i>

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.968
<i>that wasn't connected
to some memory in my mind.</i>

01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.529
<i>There, I was buying a suit
with my father.</i>

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.647
<i>There, I was having
an ice cream soda after school.</i>

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.167
<i>When I finally came in,
Debby was home from work...</i>

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:17.722
<i>and I told her everything
about my dinner with André.</i>
