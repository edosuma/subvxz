Previously on
Another Period...

00:02.009 --> 00:04.211
We are engaged.

00:04.311 --> 00:06.145
Please, Frederick,
don't do this.

00:06.246 --> 00:08.447
I hope we can still
be brother and sister.

00:08.548 --> 00:09.782
Ah!

00:10.950 --> 00:12.251
Oh, my--
Albert.

00:12.351 --> 00:15.622
No one will ever replace you.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.459
- I feel like ten bucks.
- Oh, Mother.

00:18.558 --> 00:20.159
How long are you going
to bring up your miraculous

00:20.261 --> 00:21.528
liberation from drug addiction?

00:21.627 --> 00:23.763
You sucked my dick, Madam.

00:25.432 --> 00:26.566
The press is coming.

00:26.667 --> 00:27.501
Scoops LePue.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.135
So nice to meet
a fellow writer.

00:29.236 --> 00:30.370
This little fellow's Tabu.

00:30.471 --> 00:31.938
Won him in a game
of karinki.

00:32.039 --> 00:33.139
I am yours.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.274
Forever.

00:34.374 --> 00:35.375
- No, I'm good.
- No, thank you.

00:35.475 --> 00:36.643
Thank you, though.

00:36.743 --> 00:38.945
Feeding your fish
to the commodore?

00:39.045 --> 00:41.647
I'm gonna blackmail
the shit out of her.

00:41.748 --> 00:43.150
What do you want?

00:43.249 --> 00:44.484
I want the house.

00:44.584 --> 00:46.020
We'd love to induct you

00:46.120 --> 00:48.255
as a member
of Newport's Clam Bake Club.

00:53.759 --> 00:55.861
Lillian and Beatrice
have gone missing.

00:55.962 --> 00:58.532
Those stupid bitches
are stealing our rickshaw.

00:58.631 --> 00:59.566
Bye.

01:01.935 --> 01:04.337
So tell me about yourself,
Frederick.

01:04.437 --> 01:05.839
Well, I still wet the bed.

01:05.938 --> 01:09.842
And sometimes I brown it too.

01:09.943 --> 01:12.345
There'll be plenty of times
to work out the kinks, my dear.

01:12.444 --> 01:14.714
Yes. Our whole lives.
Yay.

01:14.815 --> 01:17.149
Can I say,
I adore young couples in love.

01:17.250 --> 01:20.019
- And our readers will too.
- Well, then.

01:20.119 --> 01:21.454
I'm sure they will also

01:21.554 --> 01:25.157
love reading about the biggest damn
merger marriage in history.

01:25.257 --> 01:27.126
His steel and my magnets.

01:27.227 --> 01:28.562
That's goddamn science.

01:28.661 --> 01:30.196
Commie, you old tit.

01:35.935 --> 01:38.171
When I started,
I was a simple fur trapper.

01:38.271 --> 01:39.705
Look at me now.

01:39.806 --> 01:42.542
My son will be married
into the most powerful family

01:42.643 --> 01:44.244
on the Eastern Seaboard.

01:44.343 --> 01:45.745
Never again will they say,

01:45.846 --> 01:47.546
"You won't amount to anything,

01:47.646 --> 01:49.381
Harold Bellawitcz."

01:49.482 --> 01:50.784
I mean, Bellacourt.

01:50.884 --> 01:53.988
Someday, Celery,
that will be you and I.

Peepers, it's been
a very stressful day,

02:14.207 --> 02:16.477
with the nuptials and all.

02:16.576 --> 02:20.112
I've been having
certain cravings.

02:20.213 --> 02:22.550
I understand, Madam,
but I think it's best

02:22.649 --> 02:25.451
if we avoid becoming physical
with one another again.

02:25.552 --> 02:27.187
No, you fool.

02:27.286 --> 02:28.388
For morphine.

02:28.488 --> 02:29.456
Right. Of course.

02:29.557 --> 02:30.557
That's what I was referring to.

02:30.656 --> 02:31.558
What were you referring to?

02:31.658 --> 02:33.494
I was referring to morphine.

02:33.594 --> 02:35.995
Don't know what you were
referring to at all.

02:36.095 --> 02:37.730
What shall be done?

02:37.831 --> 02:41.535
You must strap me into the
sobriety flat until the wedding.

02:46.005 --> 02:49.709
It took me years
to marry off that useless boy.

02:49.809 --> 02:52.646
I don't want to do anything
today to jeopardize it.

02:52.745 --> 02:56.482
But, oh, I want a hit
of the good stuff so badly,

02:56.582 --> 03:01.287
I'd stuck it out of a sailor's
salt lick if I had to.

03:01.387 --> 03:04.891
For safety, Madam.

03:04.992 --> 03:08.062
I'll undo you when it's time
for the vows.

03:09.762 --> 03:12.999
Ah. There you are.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.536
My rum money's getting
a little thin.

03:25.612 --> 03:27.848
I just love the taste
of blackmail.

03:27.947 --> 03:30.516
And I'm not talking
about Scott Joplin.

03:39.225 --> 03:43.963
Did you just grab
your stomach?

03:44.064 --> 03:46.166
Holy shit.

03:46.266 --> 03:47.834
Are you pregnant?

03:47.934 --> 03:50.104
You got a little Commodore baby
in there?

03:50.203 --> 03:51.504
Choke on your own dick.

03:51.604 --> 03:54.241
If you're not pregnant,
let me punch you in the stomach.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.141
Why would I
let you punch me?

03:56.243 --> 03:57.511
I knew it.

03:57.611 --> 03:59.345
You are pregnant.

04:01.915 --> 04:04.518
I've decided
to refinance our deal.

04:04.618 --> 04:05.985
'Cause Dodo don't like it

04:06.086 --> 04:08.821
when servants spread their legs
for her husband.

04:08.922 --> 04:12.092
And I just love
telling Dodo secrets.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.528
Wait.

04:14.627 --> 04:17.262
What?

04:17.363 --> 04:19.130
What you you mean "what"?

04:19.232 --> 04:20.700
- You tell her secrets?
- I'm--

04:20.800 --> 04:22.268
You tell <i> her</i> secrets?

04:22.369 --> 04:25.405
No, no, I-- I,
well, sometimes.

04:25.504 --> 04:26.739
Look.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.843
I want to blackmail you
for more money because,

04:29.944 --> 04:33.545
uh, you're pregnant
with her husband's child,

04:33.646 --> 04:35.047
and she doesn't know that.

04:35.148 --> 04:37.417
And if she knew that,
that would be very bad for you.

04:37.516 --> 04:38.684
Does that make sense?

04:38.785 --> 04:41.054
It was a bit longwinded.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.489
Well, which part,

04:43.590 --> 04:46.159
the explaining
or the thing before it?

04:46.259 --> 04:47.461
I got the end part,

04:47.561 --> 04:49.095
but I didn't understand
the beginning at all.

04:49.194 --> 04:50.296
Oh. Okay.

04:50.396 --> 04:51.997
Well, damn it.

04:52.098 --> 04:53.932
Uh, maybe-- maybe
I'm not being clear here.

04:54.033 --> 04:56.535
Go back to the Dodo part.

04:56.636 --> 04:58.905
Dodo is married
to the commodore, right?

05:05.578 --> 05:06.480
What are you doing in here?

05:06.579 --> 05:08.847
I didn't ring for you.

05:08.948 --> 05:10.985
You don't need to ring for me.

05:11.085 --> 05:15.321
I come whenever, wherever,
and with whomever I want.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.090
You insolent wench.

05:18.191 --> 05:21.695
Put your face next to my hand
so that I can slap it.

05:28.456 --> 05:30.102
What are you doing?

05:30.203 --> 05:33.307
I think you should give in
to those cravings.

05:35.075 --> 05:36.944
Why not?

05:37.044 --> 05:40.280
No, that's too much.
It'll kill me.

05:40.379 --> 05:43.549
No.

05:43.650 --> 05:49.356
You'll be alive enough to see
me take everything you've got.

05:49.455 --> 05:51.758
Just alive enough.

05:51.859 --> 05:54.626
Faster, faster!

05:54.727 --> 05:56.029
This is an important day.

05:56.129 --> 05:58.030
- Don't you understand that?
- Go, Garfield.

05:58.131 --> 06:00.032
- We need to get there. Go.
- Go, Garfield.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.102
I don't want
to miss the wedding.

06:02.201 --> 06:03.102
Stick them up.

06:07.874 --> 06:09.008
You two.

06:09.109 --> 06:11.011
Aren't you Ponzi's
indentured child servant?

06:11.111 --> 06:14.448
No. I make my living
carriage-jacking now.

06:14.547 --> 06:15.982
What do you want, Tabu?

06:16.083 --> 06:17.917
We don't have any spices
and we're in a hurry.

06:18.018 --> 06:20.787
Allow me to accompany you
and you'll come to no harm.

06:20.888 --> 06:23.757
I only want a warm place
to stay and to serve you.

06:24.891 --> 06:26.392
- No, thank you.
- I don't think so.

06:26.492 --> 06:27.760
I have cocaine wine.

06:27.861 --> 06:28.829
All right,
you're pleased to join us.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.030
Oh! Mm-hmm.
Hop aboard.

06:34.633 --> 06:36.602
The ceremony is--

06:36.703 --> 06:38.138
Oh, no.

06:38.237 --> 06:40.806
Lady Dodo,
how did you manage to do this?

06:40.907 --> 06:43.609
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

06:43.710 --> 06:45.111
I was only gone
for five minutes,

06:45.210 --> 06:49.148
and here you are injecting
yourself with poison.

06:49.249 --> 06:50.551
Dodo.

06:50.650 --> 06:51.751
What are you telling me?

06:51.852 --> 06:53.053
- What are you saying?
- No.

06:53.152 --> 06:54.754
- What, you didn't do this?
- No.

06:54.854 --> 06:56.588
Dodo, did somebody
do this to you?

06:56.688 --> 06:59.225
- Oh, Lady Dodo.
- Mm-hmm.

06:59.325 --> 07:03.530
Who did this to you?
Tell me who did-- the wallpaper?

07:03.629 --> 07:05.031
The wainscoting?

07:05.131 --> 07:06.532
No? The settee?

07:06.633 --> 07:08.835
The Rodin sculpture?

07:08.934 --> 07:11.104
The Triceratops fossil?

07:11.205 --> 07:13.205
The gold pelican vase?

07:13.306 --> 07:15.376
The Zulu hunting spear?

07:15.475 --> 07:16.942
The chair? The chair?

07:18.212 --> 07:19.339
Chair.

07:19.547 --> 07:21.282
Have you counted
the towels recently?

07:21.381 --> 07:22.716
Chair gave it to me.

07:22.816 --> 07:24.217
She's in the meat locker.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.121
She did this.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.693
What are you doing out here,
you muskrat?

07:31.792 --> 07:35.061
The Commodore called out
the name Celine.

07:35.162 --> 07:37.899
Sir, I'm the new servant girl,
Celine.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.742
Chair!

07:47.575 --> 07:50.546

07:50.645 --> 07:52.681

07:56.818 --> 07:59.288
This is
Mitchell P. Spiritwalker.

07:59.388 --> 08:03.358
I authorize the release
of Blanche the servant.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.960
Hmm?

08:05.059 --> 08:07.429
Oh, I'm sorry, operator.
That is my mistake.

08:07.528 --> 08:11.232
I'm still figuring out how these
infernal contraptions work.

08:12.635 --> 08:14.270
Can you see me?

08:14.369 --> 08:15.304
Now, move it.

08:15.403 --> 08:17.072
- Go, Garfield.
- Hurry, go faster.

08:17.172 --> 08:18.506
- Hurry. Move, man. Move!
- Go. What are you waiting for?

08:18.607 --> 08:20.642
- What is wrong with you?
- Mush, Garfield. Mush.

08:20.741 --> 08:23.512
Shut your spoiled mouths!

08:26.415 --> 08:29.217
All I ever wanted
was to be a servant.

08:29.316 --> 08:31.585
As a little boy,
I dreamed of eating gruel

08:31.686 --> 08:34.556
and scrubbing the anuses
of the very rich.

08:34.657 --> 08:38.059
I'd sneak to the latrines
of the great houses of Newport,

08:38.159 --> 08:40.794
stick my head into a trench,
take a deep sniff,

08:40.895 --> 08:42.898
and think, "Someday."

08:42.999 --> 08:45.200
And I served with pride
at Bellacourt Manor

08:45.300 --> 08:50.439
only to be tossed
into the streets like a beggar!

08:50.538 --> 08:53.107
All right.
We understand you have feelings.

08:53.207 --> 08:55.276
Now take us home, Garfield.

08:55.377 --> 08:56.777
Now, Jarfeld!

08:56.878 --> 08:58.714
I no longer work for you.

08:58.814 --> 09:01.416
If you want my help, you're
going to have to say "please."

09:01.516 --> 09:02.718
Never.

09:02.817 --> 09:06.353
Well, then you three
enjoy yourselves.

09:06.454 --> 09:07.522
Pease.

09:07.622 --> 09:08.657
No.

09:08.757 --> 09:13.695
Pea...

09:13.796 --> 09:14.830
Still, no.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.700
Plea-- plea--

09:19.801 --> 09:25.306
Plea-- plea--

09:26.407 --> 09:28.878
Good-bye.

09:29.878 --> 09:31.547
Please?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.384
Well, when you put it that way.

09:36.484 --> 09:38.620
Come on.
We're still to make the wedding.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.327
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

09:48.763 --> 09:50.999
What a functional wedding
that was,

09:51.098 --> 09:53.300
that just happened
one moment ago.

09:53.499 --> 09:55.971
Congratulations, or whatever.

09:56.071 --> 09:59.707
And now it's time
for the mother-son dance.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.309
That's you.

10:03.345 --> 10:04.779
There must be some way
out of this.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.414
That man is an imbecile.

10:08.182 --> 10:09.717
Oh, muffin, please.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.486
Plenty of strong women have
married imbeciles and thrived.

10:12.587 --> 10:14.523
Look at Mary Todd Lincoln.

10:19.627 --> 10:22.797
They say behind every great man
is a great woman.

10:22.898 --> 10:26.435
Not a morphine-soaked sack
of dusty rags.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.572
Maybe you need a new woman
to run the estate.

10:33.641 --> 10:36.111
I'm starting to think
you're right.

10:36.211 --> 10:37.279
Chair.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.781
Go polish the turtles.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.717
I love polishing things.

10:45.153 --> 10:46.654
- Sir, sir.
- Hmm?

10:46.755 --> 10:48.323
I must speak with you
about that serving girl.

10:48.423 --> 10:50.058
No, she's off limits.

10:50.158 --> 10:52.060
Dip your feather duster
elsewhere.

10:52.159 --> 10:54.029
She's an agent
of chaos and destruction.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.096
She must be fired.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.231
Not only will she
not be fired,

10:57.332 --> 10:58.933
but if I ever hear you
slander her again

10:59.034 --> 11:02.503
or molest her in any way,
it is you who will be fired.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.138
- But-- but--
- No molesting!

11:04.239 --> 11:05.374
That's an order!

11:07.608 --> 11:09.811
As you wish, sir.

11:43.611 --> 11:44.779
We're back.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.481
We're here
to stop the wedding!

11:47.915 --> 11:50.518
Hi, Frederick.
It's me, Garfield.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.389
Does anybody care
where we've been?

11:54.489 --> 11:57.492
I just figured you died.

11:57.592 --> 11:58.992
Rather disappointed, actually.

12:07.434 --> 12:08.502
There you are.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.871
You've missed everything.

12:09.971 --> 12:11.239
The wedding is over.

12:11.338 --> 12:13.073
What? No.

12:13.174 --> 12:15.375
You came too late, Bea.

12:15.476 --> 12:17.578
I'm Mr. Celery Savoy now.

12:17.678 --> 12:19.581
Beatrice,
you look like a doll

12:19.680 --> 12:21.282
who's been flung
into a trash heap.

12:21.382 --> 12:23.483
Lillian, you look like you
escaped from a whorehouse

12:23.583 --> 12:25.118
for insane pygmies.

12:25.218 --> 12:26.820
Is that a bathing costume?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.289
Not typical attire
for a wedding.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.792
Which is odd for you,

12:30.891 --> 12:32.893
'cause you're usually
such a typical girl.

12:39.733 --> 12:41.402
Wet Christmas, it's a scandal!

12:56.250 --> 12:58.754
The Bellacourts
are the worst family in Newport.

13:02.924 --> 13:04.993
Someone wrote an exposé
about our family.

13:05.094 --> 13:08.197
They called us
the "modern pigs."

13:08.297 --> 13:11.399
Father,
you impregnated a servant?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.102
Beatrice.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.704
You're sleeping
with our brother?

13:15.804 --> 13:18.740
You're both incestors.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.308
And you, Lillian.

13:20.408 --> 13:23.444
You slept with
our most disgusting servant.

13:23.546 --> 13:25.980
Mm, ha ha ha.

13:26.081 --> 13:27.014
Ooh.

13:27.115 --> 13:28.317
Eee.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.086
Ah.

13:30.186 --> 13:31.153
And you.

13:31.254 --> 13:32.754
Yes! It's true!

13:32.855 --> 13:34.389
It's all true!

13:34.490 --> 13:39.161
Albert and I are in a loving
and committed relationship.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.930
You're actually not mentioned
in the article.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.903
I'm... just joshing.

13:47.003 --> 13:49.205
Trying to lighten the mood.

13:49.304 --> 13:50.872
Some jokes.

13:50.972 --> 13:53.341
Yum, yummy vaginas.

13:53.442 --> 13:55.076
Right, boys?

13:55.177 --> 13:57.212
Who would publish such lies?

13:57.312 --> 14:00.682
Well, it must have been
that muckraker Scoops LePue.

14:00.783 --> 14:03.719
You've been lurking
around our family for months.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.754
I didn't write it.

14:05.854 --> 14:07.256
By my trough, I swear.

14:07.355 --> 14:11.994
I only cover gossip.

14:12.094 --> 14:14.664
Oh, wait.

14:14.764 --> 14:17.032
We are leaving.

14:17.131 --> 14:19.400
Yes, we are leaving.

14:19.599 --> 14:21.736
No,<i> we</i> are leaving.

14:21.836 --> 14:23.605
You people are perfect
for Baltimore.

14:23.706 --> 14:25.108
You're disgusting.

14:27.275 --> 14:28.810
Daddy, help.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.312
Sorry, Cel.

14:30.413 --> 14:31.513
This is your family now.

14:31.613 --> 14:33.182
There's nothing I can do.

14:33.282 --> 14:35.584
Well, there is one thing
I can do.

14:35.683 --> 14:39.988
I can cut off all business ties
with this family.

14:41.789 --> 14:44.626
No, Daddy, don't go.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.261
Mommy.
Mommy, please.

14:47.363 --> 14:50.432
You have sullied
the family name.

14:50.532 --> 14:53.235
You destroyed it all
because of your selfishness.

14:53.335 --> 14:54.302
I'm not selfish.

14:54.403 --> 14:55.736
I just care
about my own pleasure

14:55.836 --> 14:57.338
without regard for others.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.974
I'm sorry I slept with
Frederick for 25 years, Daddy.

15:00.075 --> 15:01.944
I don't care what you did.

15:02.043 --> 15:03.477
I only care that people
found out.

15:03.577 --> 15:05.880
I cannot have this scandal.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.548
You're banished
from Bellacourt!

15:07.649 --> 15:09.217
Collect your things.

15:09.317 --> 15:10.218
What? No!

15:17.759 --> 15:21.530
Just when I thought
I found a home, banished.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.672
Yes, to my great shame,
I was...

15:29.772 --> 15:31.440
tricked into firing Garfield.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.708
Now I must rectify
the situation.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.077
Does this mean
I have my old job back?

15:36.177 --> 15:37.379
Of course not, you imbecile.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.181
Your old position
has been nullified.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.185
But I was able
to move some things about,

15:43.285 --> 15:46.087
and I can offer you the position
of potato scrubber.

15:46.187 --> 15:48.189
The hours are long,
the work is dangerous,

15:48.289 --> 15:49.991
and you'll be paid 1/10th
the wage.

15:50.091 --> 15:51.793
Oh, it's all I ever wanted.

15:51.894 --> 15:55.330
Thank you, Mr. Peepers.

15:55.429 --> 15:57.098
And here.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.437
Towel was never mine
to begin with.

16:01.537 --> 16:04.907
Somewhere, inside,
I always knew that.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.011
Thank you, Garfield.

16:10.111 --> 16:11.581
Oh, a stain.

16:33.301 --> 16:35.170
What are you doing
in here?

16:35.269 --> 16:38.975
This is where we do
our on-site diamond cutting.

16:40.274 --> 16:43.411
Well, it's my room now.

16:43.511 --> 16:44.612
Ask your husband.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.015
I won't stand for it.

16:47.115 --> 16:50.119
Servants cannot move upstairs.

16:50.219 --> 16:55.458
Earthworms don't change
into butterflies, Chair.

No!

You!

Hamish Crassus,

18:08.396 --> 18:12.800
Celine had me arrested
for murdering Scoops LePue.

18:12.901 --> 18:15.471
Who the hell
is Scoops LePue?

18:15.570 --> 18:17.872
Does anybody know
who the fuck that is, huh?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.579
I was ordered
not to touch Chair.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.083
Nobody said anything
about reporters.

18:29.917 --> 18:33.020
Nobody besmirches
the Bellacourts under my watch.

18:33.121 --> 18:34.056
Nobody.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.824

20:05.613 --> 20:07.683
I never met anyone famous
before.

20:10.419 --> 20:11.653
- Famous?
- Oh, yeah.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.889
- Everybody knows who you are.
- Really?

20:13.988 --> 20:15.592
Your family's more messed up
than mine.

20:15.691 --> 20:19.094
And my father fed my mother
to us in a stew he made.

20:19.194 --> 20:20.662
Oh, will you sign my pepper?

20:20.763 --> 20:21.898
Ohh!

20:24.033 --> 20:25.235
Hey, everybody, look.

20:25.334 --> 20:26.669
It's the Pig Sisters.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.770
And they're even more pig-like
in person.

20:28.871 --> 20:30.873
- Yeah. We're the Pig Sisters.
- That's us.

20:32.808 --> 20:34.376
Beatrice and I
were thinking too small.

20:34.477 --> 20:36.612
Forget trying to get accepted
into society.

20:36.711 --> 20:39.781
We're going to get famous.

20:39.882 --> 20:41.383
Yeah.

20:41.484 --> 20:44.687
I love you all.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.488
I don't know how to spell.

20:46.588 --> 20:48.290
But I made that.

20:48.391 --> 20:50.459
Love, Lillian.

20:50.559 --> 20:51.693
Anyone want to sketch me?

20:51.794 --> 20:53.728
I'll try.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.332
