WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:15.999
- Previously this season
on "Below Deck"...

00:15.999 --> 00:17.999
- You and I are really good
on a personal level.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.999
- Amy and I have gotten really
close this charter season.

00:19.999 --> 00:20.999
- Cheers.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
- Connie's just a workhorse.
- Yep.

00:22.999 --> 00:23.999
- You're my lead deckhand,

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
the only one I trust.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- Okay, Peter Glaser

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
is bringing
his business partner

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
and their hot girlfriends.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- Gonna be an exciting
last charter.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
- Yeah.

00:31.999 --> 00:35.999
- You're the one
who f***ing cheated on me.

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
- Mm, it's so good.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
- Yo, it got real last night.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
- If you're leaving,
I'm going.

00:43.999 --> 00:44.999
- Get me home.

00:44.999 --> 00:45.999
- She's gonna jump.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
- Yeah, she's jumping.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- We got Rocky in the water.

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
I'm embarrassed that I've ever

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
been involved with her
in any way.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- He and I had a little thing
going on the whole time.

00:54.999 --> 00:55.999
- I want to talk to him.

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
- I could see, like,
a physical fight

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
coming out of it.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.999
- I think someone like that
is dishonest,

01:24.999 --> 01:27.999
and I think someone like that
needs to be called out.

01:27.999 --> 01:28.999
- No, Emile,
you've got to let her--

01:28.999 --> 01:32.999
- No, you're not leaving--ow.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.999
Oh, my God, I blew it
by talking to him.

01:38.999 --> 01:39.999
- I'm telling you.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
Did you see how he was?

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
- Are you frustrated
you didn't get Eddie and I did?

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
- Oh, absolutely.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.999
I told you I was jealous.

01:50.999 --> 01:51.999
- Marcy, Marcy, baby.
- Go left.

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
- Wait, what?
- Further left.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.999
- Straddle it, Marcy.

01:55.999 --> 01:56.999
- Eddie, Emile,
Eddie, Emile.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
- One for the back
and one for the front.

01:58.999 --> 01:59.999
- Vito or John,

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
can you take another one
from the side?

02:01.999 --> 02:06.999
- Vito, we love you for being
such a good sport.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
- Look how much sand is--

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
- Did they already tell you
what they wanted for dinner?

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
- No, I'm gonna do
an arugula chiffonade.

02:14.999 --> 02:17.999
Gonna do a tuna tartar,
a crispy quail.

02:18.999 --> 02:19.999
Ow!

02:19.999 --> 02:20.999
f*** you!

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
- Ben just cut himself.
- Holy f***.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.000
- He needs medical attention.

02:26.999 --> 02:27.000
- I'm coming.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
Somebody shut that engine off.

02:30.999 --> 02:31.999
- Here you go,
that's really cute.

02:31.999 --> 02:32.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
- Sh**.

02:34.999 --> 02:35.999
- Hey, bud.
- Hi.

02:35.999 --> 02:36.999
- How is it?

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
- I'm not gonna lie;
it's bad.

02:38.999 --> 02:39.999
- I'm gonna go look
for things.

02:39.999 --> 02:42.999
- Can I see?
- Yeah, sure.

02:42.999 --> 02:44.000
- I took the whole
f***ing knuckle off, basically.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.999
- Oh, you sure did.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
- I'd rather not look at it,
personally.

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- I understand.

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
- Here you go, bud.
- Thank you.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
- Up in the bridge,
there's another first aid kit,

02:50.999 --> 02:51.999
a more extensive one.

02:51.999 --> 02:52.999
- Yeah.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
Captain, Ben has cut
his finger pretty badly,

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
but Eddie's
taking care of it.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.999
I'll keep you posted.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
- Whew, man, would it hurt.

03:01.999 --> 03:02.999
- Don't look at it, okay?
- Okay.

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
- I got this, thank you.
- All right, thank you.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
- Go ahead
and put it in there.

03:08.999 --> 03:11.999
- Yep, okay,
you can take it out.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
Thank you.

03:12.999 --> 03:15.999
You can stop spraying it.

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
Really did it.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
It's down to the cartilage.

03:17.999 --> 03:18.999
- It really likes bleeding,
doesn't it?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
- Ben, do you want me
to turn these stoves off?

03:20.999 --> 03:23.999
- Turn everything off,
please, honey.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
- f***ing hell, man.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.000
- What's up, Team Awesome?
- Hi.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- Whoa, look at the view
from up here.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- Oh, my gosh.

03:36.999 --> 03:40.000
- I've got a really big dinner
to accomplish

03:40.999 --> 03:41.999
within the next 45 minutes,

03:41.999 --> 03:44.999
which is hard enough
with two hands.

03:44.999 --> 03:48.999
How the hell am I gonna
do it with one?

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
f*** you.

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
- Some strips.

03:52.999 --> 03:53.999
- Are you okay?

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
- Am I okay?
- Yeah.

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
- I'm fine.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
- Well, the guests are fine;
they're upstairs.

04:06.999 --> 04:11.999
Yeah, I'm just gonna
keep cleaning.

04:11.999 --> 04:14.999
- I thought that she had
a very good understanding

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
that nothing was ever
gonna come of this.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
Maybe she doesn't get it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.999
- I'm gonna need
a helper tonight,

04:25.999 --> 04:26.999
and you're gonna be
my helper.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
Please, baby.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
If that's okay with Kate.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
- Of course.

04:31.999 --> 04:34.999
- I think that you're really
gonna need to be my left arm.

04:34.999 --> 04:35.999
- Okay.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
- So we're gonna have
to work together.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.999
I do happen to have
a trained chef on board.

04:40.999 --> 04:43.999
Unfortunately, it is Rocky.

04:43.999 --> 04:47.999
But I really need her,
so let's do this.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
- We're gonna mash up
some potatoes now, Miss Rocky.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
- Sure.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
- Oh, f*** yeah, brilliant,
I've found the jalapenos.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
You know what,
we're gonna kill it tonight.

04:55.999 --> 04:59.000
- Right, love?
- I mean, yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.999
- Connie, Connie Lee,

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
can you please come
to the wheelhouse ASAP?

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
- Sure can.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
If you hear your name
on the radio

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
called by the captain,

05:06.999 --> 05:08.000
be scared.

05:08.999 --> 05:11.999
If you hear your name called
to a specific place,

05:11.999 --> 05:14.999
be more scared.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
Hi, y'all.

05:16.999 --> 05:17.999
- Have a seat.

05:17.999 --> 05:20.999
- Am I in trouble?

05:20.999 --> 05:23.999
- You know, you could
construe it as that.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
The season's coming
to an end,

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
and this boat's headed
off to the Med.

05:27.999 --> 05:30.999
The crew as you know it
is gonna disperse.

05:30.999 --> 05:31.999
We're gonna be bringing on
some delivery crew.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.999
But we were wondering if you
would consider

05:35.999 --> 05:38.999
hanging out with us a while
after this present

05:38.999 --> 05:41.999
Caribbean season
comes to an end.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
- For real?

05:42.999 --> 05:43.999
Like, not just get there
and fly home?

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
Like, stay?

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
- Like, permanent.

05:47.999 --> 05:48.999
- I am super excited

05:48.999 --> 05:49.999
that I just got offered a job,

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
because, being the junior
deckhand that I am,

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
it's not common.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.999
I guess I finally got
to where I wanted to be,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.999
and I don't want to stop.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
I'm ready to keep going.

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
That would be amazing.

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
I would love to do it.

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
I don't want to go home.

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
I fell in love with this boat.

06:03.999 --> 06:06.999
- She's never worked
on a yacht before,

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
but you'd never know it
by watching her perform.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
You can tell that she's
loving what she does.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.999
- This is crazy.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
Holy sh**, I'm about
to cross the Atlantic.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
- So now get your ass
back to work.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.999
- Can't wait to go
shine some more poles.

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
- So, what'd you cut
yourself on?

06:30.999 --> 06:31.999
- A wooden spoon.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
- This is the worst peeler
in history.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
- Just use a knife, love;
it's safer.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
Go nice and thin.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.999
And if you want to use gloves,
you're welcome to.

06:42.999 --> 06:43.999
Please be careful
with that as well.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
It's just as dangerous,
if not more.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
Just wash your hands,
otherwise it'll be irritating.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
- Hey, how'd the meeting
with the captain go?

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
- It went
a lot better than I thought,

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
because they offered me
to stay on the boat

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
and do Med season.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.000
I think Emile might
take it a little personal

06:59.999 --> 07:00.999
that I got the job
that he wanted.

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
- Good job,
you deserve it.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
- Sorry, Emile.

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
Luck's not on your side
this time.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
I want another high-five
because you taught me.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
- You were easy to teach,
so...

07:08.999 --> 07:09.999
Congratulations, Connie.

07:09.999 --> 07:10.999
- Thank you very much.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
- Proud of you.
- Jeez.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- That was such
a dad thing.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.999
He's like
a "Leave It to Beaver" dad.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.999
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, there.

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
- So, when I'm a bosun,

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
I'll hire you
as my deckhand.

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
- I don't look
for deckhand positions.

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

07:28.999 --> 07:29.999
- Yes, you do.
- I don't.

07:29.999 --> 07:30.999
- You want to be
my deckhand.

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
- No.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
- I can see it
in your face right now.

07:33.999 --> 07:34.999
- Oh, my gosh.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
I'm happy for Connie,

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
but I'm not looking
to stay on this yacht.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
I'm over it.

07:39.999 --> 07:40.999
- Definitely gonna be
my deckhand.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
- Okay, next...

07:42.999 --> 07:43.999
- Look how mad he gets.

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
- ridiculous subject.

07:47.999 --> 07:49.000
- You guys want
to take it outside?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.999
Sit outside
for a little bit?

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
It's beautiful out.

07:51.999 --> 07:54.999
- This is gonna be the best meal
I've done this charter season.

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
First course is salad,

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
and then tuna tartar.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
Third will be quail,

07:58.999 --> 08:01.000
and then the fourth
is the beef.

08:01.999 --> 08:02.999
- Do you want me to just
make dinner tonight?

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
Because I could just make
dinner tonight,

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
and it'd be okay,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.999
if you want to, like,
go to bed and just rest.

08:06.999 --> 08:07.999
- Square it up a little bit.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
Cut the under sides
to clean it,

08:09.999 --> 08:10.999
and then just julienne.

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
- Instead,
I'm being his bitch.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
- Are you super happy you got
to get in your cheffy zone?

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- Rocky's having a f***ing
great day, right?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.000
- Do you feel like you're
happy to be cooking

08:20.999 --> 08:24.999
and helping him,
like you want to be doing?

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
- I--

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
I'm just breathing.

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
- I get it;
Rocky's got a lot going on.

08:30.999 --> 08:31.999
She's got stuff
going on with Eddie.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
But we're on charter,

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
and Rocky's getting
to get in the galley.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
This is where she's
always wanted to be.

08:40.999 --> 08:44.999
- What are you drinking?
- Very strong cocktail.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
- Hey, I was just coming
to find you.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
Do you want to change
into your blacks?

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
- Sure.
- Sound all right?

08:54.999 --> 08:56.999
- Hey, Kate, just want you
to know that Ashley

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
has joined the group up here.

08:58.999 --> 08:59.999
- Copy, thank you.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
Captain Lee, Captain Lee.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
All of the guests
are ready to have dinner.

09:03.999 --> 09:08.999
- Let's put on the blacks
and put on the smile.

09:08.999 --> 09:11.999
So over this f***ing job.

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
- There he is.
- How's everyone this evening?

09:18.999 --> 09:22.999
- Conch salad.

09:22.999 --> 09:23.999
- That's what
I signed up for.

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
To be your f***ing bitch.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
- Is this a ceviche?
- Yes.

09:29.999 --> 09:33.999
- Oh, my God,
this is so good.

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
- That's some good conch.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
- Conch's one
of my favorites.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999
- I can't wait to
have some real, real conch.

09:39.999 --> 09:40.999
- Wow.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
- I'd like you to
chiffonade the arugula.

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
Do you know how to do it?

09:43.999 --> 09:46.999
- Yes.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
- Just go slowly, baby.

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
Take your time.

09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
Make really nice,
thin cuts, please.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
- Me, chef.

09:52.999 --> 09:53.999
- You're getting bigger,
right?

09:53.999 --> 09:54.999
A lot bigger.

09:54.999 --> 09:55.999
- Okay, I'll get
them started.

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
- Don't slip the big ones
in here, all right?

09:57.999 --> 09:58.999
- I heard you.
- Just took them out.

09:58.999 --> 09:59.999
- Just get rid
of this sh**.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
- God forbid
a big guy comes through.

10:01.999 --> 10:04.999
- Don't make my life
harder, okay?

10:04.999 --> 10:05.999
- Okay.
- That's a warning.

10:05.999 --> 10:06.999
- What happens after a warning?

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
- I haven't decided yet.

10:08.999 --> 10:09.999
But it's not gonna get
easier for you.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
That's for sure.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.999
- Who initiated this?
- You did.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- How did I initiate this?

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- Okay, well, you like
lifted your black skirt up,

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
and you had
nothing underneath.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
- Oh, my God.

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
You're a f***ing ass****.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
it's got to be tough
for relationships.

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
Do you find
everything you need,

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
or, I mean, do you take
a couple months off?

10:38.999 --> 10:39.999
- If you don't want me
to give you encouragement,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.999
I won't.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
- No, it's just like--
I don't know.

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
- It's really not
that big a deal, honey.

10:44.999 --> 10:45.999
I was there as well.

10:45.999 --> 10:48.999
I started peeling carrots
when I was 19.

10:48.999 --> 10:51.999
It took me about 21
to get out and get past that.

10:51.999 --> 10:52.999
- He's right, actually.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
No more negative,
no more negative.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.999
Let's be positive.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.000
Let's try
to finish this off strong.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I can do this.

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

11:00.999 --> 11:01.999
Just like this on every plate?

11:01.999 --> 11:03.999
- Yep.
- Okay.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
- Okay, so that's
whipped potato,

11:07.999 --> 11:10.999
curried cream sauce
with crispy quail.

11:10.999 --> 11:13.999
Just try and make
a little tower like that.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.999
- Good job, Rocky,
that's good.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
- With only one good hand,

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
Rocky needs to step up,

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
otherwise this could
be a disaster.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
- Good job, Rocky.
- Thanks, Amy.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.999
- You're welcome.
- No problem.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
- We have crispy quail,
mashed potatoes,

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
with creamed curry sauce.

11:30.999 --> 11:31.999
- I'm ready to get my quail on.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:35.999 --> 11:36.999
- Mm.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
- This be the best quail
on the island, mon.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
- I didn't eat crew dinner,
so I'm starving.

11:45.999 --> 11:46.999
- Want to try the quail?

11:46.999 --> 11:47.999
- Sure, I'd love to.

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
- Cool, I made you one.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
If there's one devious
little trick

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
I've learned as a chef...

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
Here, try this,
f***ing awesome.

11:54.999 --> 11:58.999
The way to a woman's heart
is definitely in her tummy.

11:58.999 --> 12:01.999
- What do you think?
- It's really nice.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
- It's great.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
- Oh, check it out.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
- Oh, that's so cool.

12:15.999 --> 12:18.999
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- There we go, nice.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
- We've arranged
some Chinese lanterns

12:20.999 --> 12:23.999
to be sent off in your honor,
if y'all want to make a wish.

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:26.999 --> 12:27.999
- Look at that.

12:27.999 --> 12:30.999
That's so cool-looking.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
- Oh...

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
I'm not very good
at that, apparently.

12:44.999 --> 12:47.999
Kate's totally outdone herself
with these Chinese lanterns.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
- That's it.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.999
- Oh!

12:52.999 --> 12:53.999
- This feels like
the perfect way

12:53.999 --> 12:56.999
to end the charter season.

12:56.999 --> 12:57.999
- It was really nice.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.999
Thank you so much.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
- Well done.
- Good job, guys.

13:01.999 --> 13:02.999
- Hey, Rocky,
good job, all right?

13:02.999 --> 13:05.999
- Thanks, bud.
- Yeah, you're good.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.999
- Rocky, since you're early,
since it's 11:35,

13:08.999 --> 13:09.999
if you want to go to sleep.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.999
- Okay, I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
- Thank you.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
- Coming into this season,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.999
I didn't think
we'd be at this spot,

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
ending it this way.

13:19.999 --> 13:20.999
- Me either.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
- I'm really thankful
we are, though.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- And that's why
I saved this from the guests,

13:24.999 --> 13:25.999
'cause I was like,
I want to thank you

13:25.999 --> 13:28.999
for being such a great friend
and stewardess.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.999
- Oh, that's really special.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
- I'm so thankful
that Rocky's craziness

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
forced Amy and I
to become great friends.

13:34.999 --> 13:35.999
- Ah!

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
I'm sorry.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
- I think that Amy's strengths

13:38.999 --> 13:41.999
balance out my weaknesses,
and vice versa.

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
Aw.

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
- We made it.

13:44.999 --> 13:48.999
- We really made it.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
- Goosebumps.
- Me too!

13:50.999 --> 13:53.999
- I think it's just cold.
- No, I'm joking.

14:00.999 --> 14:01.999
- How you doing, bro?

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- I need some energy.

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
- That's fine,
just move out the way.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
- Hi, guys.

14:07.999 --> 14:08.999
Almond milk latte?

14:08.999 --> 14:09.999
- Yeah.
- Okay, perfect.

14:09.999 --> 14:10.999
- All right, Eddie.

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
Let's get out of here.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.999
- That's so wild-looking.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
- Anchors home,
for the last time.

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
- Copy that.

14:17.999 --> 14:18.999
- So excited.

14:20.999 --> 14:21.999
- Happy dance, happy dance.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.999
- Need some help, Ben?
- Yes.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
- Sweet.
- All right.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
- I'm excited.

14:29.999 --> 14:30.999
- You might get
a free breakfast.

14:30.999 --> 14:33.999
- Let's do it!
- All right, dude.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
- A man can always
learn more skills.

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
- All right, here we go.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
- Are you horny?
- Maybe.

14:43.999 --> 14:44.999
- Maybe eight.

14:44.999 --> 14:45.999
Maybe a week.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
- Okie dokes.

14:47.999 --> 14:50.999
- Can you please give me
some more berries of any kind?

14:50.999 --> 14:53.999
- Blackberries?
- Yes, thank you.

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
- Hurry up
with that bloody salmon.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
- Hey, I'm not your
girlfriend, okay?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
You don't talk to me
like that.

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
- Yes, he does.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.000
- Got a little
Chef Emile today?

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
- Guy's a legend.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
- If you're gonna
help in here, that's fine.

15:08.999 --> 15:11.999
You should have let me know
that's what you're gonna do.

15:11.999 --> 15:12.999
- Okay.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
- Are you winding my boy up?

15:13.999 --> 15:16.000
- No, but he should
ask me first.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
- Okay.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
- Now that Emile knows,
he is like a ticking time bomb,

15:19.999 --> 15:22.999
and I am afraid
he's gonna call Eddie out,

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
and Eddie's gonna get angry,

15:23.999 --> 15:26.999
and it's just not
gonna be good.

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
- Happy last day,
everyone.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
- Good morning.
- Your hair is crazy.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
- I love my hair.

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
- Your hair looks
like a cockatiel.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
- Cool,
that's my favorite bird.

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
I love the cockatiel.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
- Sausage,
we've got sausage.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.999
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, Ben.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- I know how much
you like steak, so...

15:44.999 --> 15:45.999
- Oh, nice.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
- Threw some capers
and parmesan on that.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- My man.
- All right, take care.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.999
- Cheers.
- Looks pretty sweet.

15:51.999 --> 15:54.999
- Good.
- It's real good.

15:54.999 --> 15:55.999
- Attention all crew.

15:55.999 --> 16:00.999
I need everyone
in their whites.

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
All right, let's do this.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
- Seven feet off the dock.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
- Watch your fender, dude.

16:10.999 --> 16:13.999
- Get that forward
spring line locked in.

16:13.999 --> 16:14.999
- Just got it on, Cap.

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
- Okay, lock it in.

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
Well done, everybody.

16:19.999 --> 16:20.999
- That's one of
the other girls'.

16:20.999 --> 16:23.999
- That's Sasha's.
- Okay.

16:23.999 --> 16:24.999
- How you feeling
Eduardo?

16:24.999 --> 16:25.999
- I feel great.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
Can't wait to get
these guys off the boat.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.000
- Celebrate
this great charter season.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.999
That was a smooth
docking, huh?

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
- Like butter.
- Like buttah.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
- You guys feeling good?

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
- Feeling great.
- Yes, sir.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.999
- Can I get everybody
on the aft deck?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.999
- Copy.

16:41.999 --> 16:44.999
- Our last time to do this.

16:50.999 --> 16:51.999
- Thank God.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
- I'm a little bigger now
because of you.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
- Oh, you're fine.

16:54.999 --> 16:55.999
I'm proud of that.

16:55.999 --> 16:58.000
- Captain, I got to thank you,
the whole crew.

16:58.999 --> 16:59.999
I mean, I've never been
catered to so well.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
I'm so spoiled now,
I have no idea

17:01.999 --> 17:02.999
how I'm gonna go
back to the real world.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
So I just wanted
to share that with you guys

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
and just say token
of my appreciation.

17:06.999 --> 17:09.999
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

17:09.999 --> 17:10.999
- Last one.
- Last one.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.999
- Thank you.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
There is no better feeling than
when the final charter guests

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
get off the boat at the end
of a charter season.

17:17.999 --> 17:19.999
It is a high that you
cannot buy on the street.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
It is so great.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
- Whoo-hoo!

17:22.999 --> 17:23.999
Charter season over.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
I want to burn this puppies
on the beach.

17:25.999 --> 17:26.999
Ready?

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
Ah!

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
Rah!

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
- I'm not doing that.

17:31.999 --> 17:32.999
This is worth money.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- Look at all the buttons
on the ground.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.999
- That felt good.

17:35.999 --> 17:38.999
Throw it out there.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
- Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
I need everybody
in the crew mess in five.

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
- Evening, Captain.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
- Whoa.
- That's a lot of plane tickets.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
- Oh, no.
- Is that mine?

17:53.999 --> 17:54.999
- It was a good charter.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
They were certainly happy.

17:56.999 --> 17:59.999
It came out to $13,000.

17:59.999 --> 18:04.999
So it is $1,180 each.

18:04.999 --> 18:06.999
Eddie, Ben...

18:06.999 --> 18:09.999
- Thank you, Captain.

18:09.999 --> 18:10.999
- Kate.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
We did nine charters.

18:12.999 --> 18:15.999
For those of you that were here
for all nine charters,

18:15.999 --> 18:19.999
that's almost $150,000
in tips laid out for the crew.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.999
- I'm thankful that we've
all finished it out.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
- Oh, I'm really glad
you all finished it out too.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
- It wasn't an easy season,

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
but clearly all the guests
were happy,

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
so I think that just speaks
of how great

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
every single crew member did,

18:33.999 --> 18:36.999
despite our differences
or experience.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.999
- I realized, I'm not mad
at anyone other than myself

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
for putting myself
in this position.

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
Like, this whole stew position,
for me,

18:43.999 --> 18:44.999
has been very difficult.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
I wanted to say, like,
hey, Kate and Amy,

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
I really thank you
for putting up with me,

18:48.999 --> 18:51.999
and I'm sorry that I--

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
you guys should have had,
like, a strong-ass third stew,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.999
and you guys got me,
and, f***, I'm sorry.

18:56.999 --> 18:57.999
Like, I'm really sorry.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
You guys had
to put up with a lot.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.999
And thanks for
showing me everything.

19:00.999 --> 19:03.000
And I know how to iron
like a mother****er.

19:03.999 --> 19:04.999
I know how to clean.

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
I know how to
do everything now.

19:05.999 --> 19:08.999
And I feel like
I'm a way better person now

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
than I was
when I walked on this boat.

19:10.999 --> 19:13.999
So thank you,
and thanks for everyone else.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.999
That was an experience
I'll never forget.

19:15.999 --> 19:18.999
- Rocky's apology was not
what I was expecting,

19:18.999 --> 19:20.000
but I'm pleasantly surprised.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.999
- The owner has arranged

19:21.999 --> 19:25.999
for a beach party tonight
for you guys.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
That's after
we finish our work.

19:28.999 --> 19:29.999
- Get back to work.

19:29.999 --> 19:30.999
- Eddie, you're so mean.

19:30.999 --> 19:32.999
- He runs a tight ship.

19:32.999 --> 19:33.999
- Okay, I'll change it.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
Everybody, back to work.

19:36.999 --> 19:37.999
- Well said, Captain.

19:37.999 --> 19:40.999
- Got to hide this.
- I need a fan.

19:44.999 --> 19:47.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
- Good luck in the future,
everyone.

19:57.999 --> 19:58.999
- Hello?

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.999
- Ready to be able
to talk to you on the phone.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
- You know that's right.

20:05.999 --> 20:08.999
I need to go home and take
a long look at my relationship.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.999
You don't go and cheat
on your girlfriend

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
if you're really happy with her.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
- Think about what you want
to do this weekend.

20:14.999 --> 20:17.999
Let me take you out to dinner.

20:17.999 --> 20:18.999
- Yeah, that would be great.

20:18.999 --> 20:19.999
Well, I'll take you
out to dinner.

20:19.999 --> 20:20.999
I can't wait
to see you, sweetie.

20:20.999 --> 20:24.999
- I can't wait
to see you either.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.999
- I'm conflicted,
'cause part of me is like,

20:26.999 --> 20:27.999
okay, it's none of my business.

20:27.999 --> 20:28.999
This is y'all's thing.

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
Two adults, work it out.

20:29.999 --> 20:32.000
But Emile may run
straight to Eddie

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
and confront him
about this situation.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
And I think
that's the last person

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
that Eddie needs
to hear this information from.

20:38.999 --> 20:39.999
- Hey, Eddie.
- Yes?

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
- Do you have a second?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- Rocky, if you're spreading
these rumors about me,

20:45.999 --> 20:46.999
at least talk to me about it.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.999
- I mean, come on.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
I mean, what the f***
is your problem?

20:49.999 --> 20:50.999
What are you doing?

20:50.999 --> 20:51.999
Dude, nothing ever happened.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
ddie.	- Yes?

21:00.999 --> 21:03.999
- Do you have a second?

21:03.999 --> 21:04.999
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.999
- What's going on?

21:06.999 --> 21:07.999
- I just wanted to give you--

21:07.999 --> 21:10.999
I don't even know--
like a little heads-up.

21:10.999 --> 21:15.999
- Yeah?
- Um...

21:15.999 --> 21:18.999
Rocky is kind of, like,
talking about some things.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
And she's talking about, like,
some things between you and her.

21:20.999 --> 21:24.999
- Like what?

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
- Like y'all hooking up.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
- What?
- Yeah.

21:27.999 --> 21:30.999
- I wanted you to know,
so maybe you can talk to her.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
- Why the f*** would she
say that sh**?

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
There is no reason
to bring it out like this.

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
f*** bullsh**.

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
- Is everything all right?

21:37.999 --> 21:38.999
What happened?

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
- Oh, gosh.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.000
- What happened?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.999
- Rocky's talking about
that they hooked up.

21:43.999 --> 21:46.999
- What the f***
are you talking about?

21:49.999 --> 21:51.999
- Hey, Rocky?

21:51.999 --> 21:52.999
Rocky?

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
Can you unlock the door?

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
Okay, I'll f***ing do it.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.000
Hey, Rocky?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.999
Rocky, if you're spreading
these rumors about me,

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
at least talk to me about it.

22:07.999 --> 22:11.999
Come on, why would you
be saying these things?

22:11.999 --> 22:12.999
I mean, what the f***
is your problem?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
What are you doing?

22:14.999 --> 22:15.999
Why are you doing this?

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
- What are you doing?

22:23.999 --> 22:24.999
- Yes, I do.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.999
So why are you saying
these things?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
Rocky, what the f***?

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
At least look at me.

22:33.999 --> 22:36.999
What the f*** did I do

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
to make you
treat me like this?

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
- Oh, my God.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.000
Is he really doing this
right now?

22:42.999 --> 22:43.999
He's trying to make me
look like a liar.

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
- Do you want to talk
to Eddie and just--

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
Okay.

22:49.999 --> 22:50.999
This feels like just another
crazy Rocky moment.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
Maybe this didn't happen.

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
Because if it did,

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
then why is she hiding
under the covers?

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
- Rocky, if you're saying
these f***ing things about me,

22:58.999 --> 23:01.999
I think I have
a right to be here.

23:01.999 --> 23:04.999
You're saying that something
happened between us?

23:04.999 --> 23:05.999
Why can't we just talk,

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
and we can figure out
what you're saying

23:07.999 --> 23:08.999
and why you're saying it.

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
- I think this guy is a coward,
no balls.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
- I mean,
nothing ever happened,

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
so I don't know
why you would say it.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
- Yeah, really.

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
Nothing ever happened.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
- Why would she make that up?

23:27.999 --> 23:29.000
- I don't know.

23:29.999 --> 23:30.999
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- Why don't you just talk to him
and tell him

23:31.999 --> 23:32.999
what you've been saying?

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
- Why would you make it up?

23:34.999 --> 23:35.999
I don't think you'd
just make it up,

23:35.999 --> 23:37.999
so say it.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.999
- I'm not in there;
I'm in the room next-door.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
- Why would she go
to that length

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
to make something up?

23:45.999 --> 23:47.000
- I don't know.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
- Mm-hmm.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
- He just wants to act
like it didn't happen

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
because he wants
to save his ass.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
- f***, I don't know
why she's trying to bury me.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
Nothing's happened, man.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
Nothing happened.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
- It's like,
a little hurt.

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
- You're hurt
that he denied it?

24:17.999 --> 24:18.999
- Yeah, of course.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
- I understand that.

24:19.999 --> 24:20.999
That would be
really painful.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
- Why would she make
something up that ridiculous?

24:23.999 --> 24:24.999
- I don't know,
maybe I pissed her off.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
Maybe she's
trying to make you angry.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.000
- Why would she do that?

24:28.999 --> 24:29.999
- Because you have
a huge crush on her,

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
and she doesn't like you,

24:30.999 --> 24:31.999
and she's trying
to make you angry,

24:31.999 --> 24:33.999
trying to make you jealous,
trying to back you off.

24:33.999 --> 24:37.999
- What a complete douchebag.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.999
- Hey, Emile,
what's going on?

24:41.999 --> 24:45.000
- Apparently, Eddie and Rocky
have been hooking up.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.999
- Eddie and Rocky?
- Yeah.

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
- No, they haven't.

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
Where did that come from?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.999
What are you talking about?

24:53.999 --> 24:56.999
- Eddie and Rocky
have been hooking up.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
- Who told you this?

24:58.999 --> 24:59.999
- Rocky.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.000
They've been f***ing.

25:01.999 --> 25:02.999
That's what she says.

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
- Eddie would not do that.

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999
Eddie cannot stand her.

25:04.999 --> 25:07.999
Eddie has a girlfriend
that he's extremely into.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
I think Rocky
is totally making this up

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
just to get under Emile's skin.

25:10.999 --> 25:11.999
She's crazy.

25:11.999 --> 25:14.000
- Why would she
make that up?

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
Think about it.

25:15.999 --> 25:16.999
- Because she's
so f***ing annoying.

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
I don't believe it
at all.

25:19.999 --> 25:20.999
Let's get away
from down here.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
- Hello?
- Hi.

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
- Hi, sorry.

25:23.999 --> 25:24.999
Can I get you anything?

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
- Do you want to tell her?

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
- What's going on?

25:33.999 --> 25:36.999
- Like, not kidding,
not bullsh**.

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
- Well, good for you.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
It happens on boats,
no big deal.

25:39.999 --> 25:40.999
I just wanted to make sure
you guys weren't waiting on me,

25:40.999 --> 25:43.999
but clearly you're not.

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
- Yeah.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
- First of all, when did you
have time to do this?

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
It explains why there's
no laundry getting done.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
Second of all,
I don't even care.

25:50.999 --> 25:51.999
Keep it to yourself.

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
Go hook up right now,
I don't care.

25:53.999 --> 25:54.999
This is my last day,
and I want to celebrate

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
and think about me, not you.

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
We're gonna have a fun night.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
- Yeah.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
- Of course I'm gonna try
to deny it at first,

26:08.999 --> 26:11.000
but I feel bad for Rocky.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
I didn't want to see her
get hurt.

26:13.999 --> 26:16.999
This isn't who I am.

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
- I think you should get dressed

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
and get ready
for a fun night out.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
I think in passing you could
give Eddie a conversation

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
of, like, "Hey, buddy,

26:26.999 --> 26:27.999
"wasn't sure how
all that went down.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
"Maybe I didn't handle it
the right way.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
Didn't mean to upset you."

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
- All I know is, I'm gonna
have a good time tonight.

26:37.999 --> 26:38.999
- Yeah, let's do it.

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
- Are y'all ready
to walk to the beach?

26:39.999 --> 26:40.999
- Yep.
- Let's go.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
- Come on, Eddie.

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- Whatever you did, Eddie,

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
I'm proud of you.

26:45.999 --> 26:46.999
- You guys are my true friends.

26:46.999 --> 26:48.999
I love y'all.

26:51.999 --> 26:52.999
- Do we have our own bartender?

26:52.999 --> 26:53.999
- I'm trained.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
- Charter season is over.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
Work is done;
let's go party.

26:57.999 --> 26:58.999
- Oh, look at this.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
- Did Kate do this?
- I wish.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Ridiculous.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
- I feel like our beach party
was put to shame

27:05.999 --> 27:06.999
after seeing this.

27:06.999 --> 27:07.999
- Hey, easy.

27:07.999 --> 27:08.999
It's a beautiful evening.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
And I hope that we all
come together and celebrate

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999
the past six weeks of work
being over.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.000
- We're here together,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.999
old friends and new.

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
To the future.

27:19.999 --> 27:20.999
- To the future,
all right.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.999
I like that.

27:22.999 --> 27:26.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
- Shadow monkey!

27:30.999 --> 27:31.999
- I'm going to the super
positive bar right there.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.999
- Yeah, me too.

27:33.999 --> 27:37.000
- Shots and s'mores?

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

27:43.999 --> 27:46.999
- Look at all these shirts
you brought.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.999
- I brought a ton of them,
to burn them.

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
- Hey, Eddie, you got it.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
- Wow, Eddie.
- I mean, that is blazing.

27:53.999 --> 27:56.999
- That's awesome.
- Way to go, Eddie.

27:56.999 --> 27:57.999
- Eddie, smile.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
Eddie?

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
- It's like the most beautiful
beach party I've ever seen.

28:01.999 --> 28:04.999
There's a bonfire, there's food,
there's drinks.

28:04.999 --> 28:08.999
And then we've got this
sad little love triangle

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
ruining it all.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
- Hey, at least we'll be able
to find a lighter tonight.

28:20.999 --> 28:24.999
- Can I have a Grey Goose
on the rocks, please?

28:24.999 --> 28:27.999
- Cheers.
- Salud.

28:27.999 --> 28:28.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
- Rocky, how are you?

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
- I'm good, how are you guys?

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
You look great, Captain.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
- Thank you.

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999
- Do you want to talk to me?
- Sure.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
- Let's go.

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
- They definitely made this
night extremely awkward.

28:43.999 --> 28:47.999
- Yeah, they ruined
our final night.

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
- You know,
you're a great girl.

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
You are.

28:50.999 --> 28:51.999
- Okay.

28:51.999 --> 28:56.999
- But, you know,
I f***ed up.

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
I...

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
I never should have done
what I did.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
And...

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
And I'm sorry for that.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
It just sucks that,
for whatever reason,

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
you had to go and talk
to other people, other than me.

29:07.999 --> 29:08.999
I don't know
why you had to do that.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.999
We could have figured
this out on our own.

29:10.999 --> 29:11.999
- I hear you.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
- I'm sorry if I hurt you,

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
and I'm sorry
the way things turned out.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
It really sucks,
and I'm sorry.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- I feel good that he said,

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
"You're a good person.

29:20.999 --> 29:23.999
Like, you know, it wasn't
your fault; it was mine."

29:23.999 --> 29:27.999
But I realize
maybe it's my fault too.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.999
Sh** happened.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
That's over now.

29:31.999 --> 29:35.999
We go forward
and move forward with our lives.

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
I didn't want it
to end like this.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
You know what I mean?

29:38.999 --> 29:39.999
- I'm ripped apart.

29:39.999 --> 29:40.999
I treated her poorly,

29:40.999 --> 29:46.999
and I'm sorry for making her
feel less than she is.

29:46.999 --> 29:47.999
- With that being said,

29:47.999 --> 29:50.999
would you like to have
a good evening as friends?

29:50.999 --> 29:51.999
- I'd love to have
a good evening as friends.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
And I'd love to walk
off this boat as friends.

29:54.999 --> 29:57.999
So now just enjoy
the fire and enjoy the party

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
and not worry about it,
all right?

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
- Okay, can I get a hug?

29:59.999 --> 30:00.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
- There's no denying it now.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
I got to come to terms
with the mistakes I've made

30:04.999 --> 30:05.999
and try to repair them.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
- Cheers, girl.
- Cheers.

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
- To ending the season
with a bang.

30:10.999 --> 30:15.999
I'm tired, and I've had
a few drinks.

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
- I don't want
to light on fire.

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
- And...

30:19.999 --> 30:21.999
just had enough.

30:21.999 --> 30:25.999
Yes, guys, we f***ed.

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
Cheers.

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
- I think you're
a f***ing ass****.

30:29.999 --> 30:30.999
- Really?
Why?

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
- You want to put this
all one me?

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
It takes two to tango,
homie.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Whoa!

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- I'm throwing in the towel.

30:44.999 --> 30:45.999
I surrender.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
- Okay,		 Eros.

30:47.999 --> 30:48.999
You've been good to me,

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
but you haven't been
that good to me.

30:50.999 --> 30:51.999
Goddess of love.

30:51.999 --> 30:52.999
- That ain't no
goddess of love.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
That's goddess of
f***ing secret love.

30:56.999 --> 30:59.999
- Throw it like a helicopter!

30:59.999 --> 31:00.999
Whoa!

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
You know,		 Eros			 spelled
backwards is "sore."

31:05.999 --> 31:06.999
I'm just saying.

31:16.999 --> 31:17.999
Oh, God.

31:17.999 --> 31:18.999
- Wait, what?

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
I thought Rocky was totally
making this up

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
just to get
under Emile's skin.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- And it was awesome!

31:24.999 --> 31:25.999
It was great!

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
Laundry room.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
Okay, if he's gonna say it,

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
I'm gonna freakin' say it.

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
- There it is.

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
- Finally, dude.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
You're a false person.

31:34.999 --> 31:35.999
You've lied.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
You've tried
to embarrass this girl.

31:37.999 --> 31:41.999
And now at least
the truth comes out.

31:41.999 --> 31:42.999
- Hey, Eddie,
now that everyone knows,

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
you could get a blowjob tonight.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.999
- Maybe I will.
- You should, you deserve one.

31:46.999 --> 31:47.999
- Maybe I do.

31:47.999 --> 31:48.999
- I'm speechless.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.999
I mean, this is the last thing
I'd expect from Eddie.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.999
I really looked at him
as, like,

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
this big brother boy scout.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
I'm confused, because this
isn't the Eddie that I know.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.999
- Yeah, let's get
that hot tub running again.

32:00.999 --> 32:03.999
- It is like Eddie has been
invaded by a body snatcher,

32:03.999 --> 32:05.999
because who is this guy
that I used to look up to?

32:05.999 --> 32:06.999
He's not here anymore.

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
- Amy, you want a beer?
- Yes.

32:08.999 --> 32:10.999
- I'm gonna come with you guys.
- Yeah, that was weird.

32:10.999 --> 32:11.999
- And why would Eddie
announce that

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
in front of the captain?

32:13.999 --> 32:14.999
- So it was good?
- Amazing.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
- Was it?
- Amazing.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
- Eddie, have you been
holding out on me?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.999
- I'm not gonna say
anything more.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
- You go,
you just go and slay,

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
my little slayer.

32:32.999 --> 32:35.999
- Well, Edward.
- Well, Cap.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
- You got your dirty laundry
aired but good.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- Okay.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.999
- I don't mind telling you
I'm disappointed.

32:42.999 --> 32:45.999
It was just
a colossal f***-up.

32:45.999 --> 32:46.999
- Yeah, a colossal--

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
- And I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it for your ass.

32:48.999 --> 32:51.999
I expected more.

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
I'm disappointed in Eddie
on so many levels.

32:53.999 --> 32:56.000
I mean, messing around
with the third stew?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.999
He knows better.

32:57.999 --> 32:58.999
He was letting one head
do the thinking

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
for the other head.

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
- How do I make it right?

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
- You can't change
what happened.

33:04.999 --> 33:05.999
- No, I know.

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
- But you don't have to carry on
with this bullsh** facade

33:08.999 --> 33:11.000
that you've been perpetrating
all evening,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.999
like everything's great
and fun-and-games

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
and all the rest of that sh**,
'cause it's not.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
- This is probably one of
the biggest f***-ups of my life.

33:17.999 --> 33:20.999
I know what I did was wrong.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
I'm ashamed.

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
- Now you need to own it

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
and realize that it's
what you do

33:25.999 --> 33:28.999
moving forward that counts.

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
You'll be just fine.

33:30.999 --> 33:33.999
- Thanks, Cap.
- Yep.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- You okay?
- I'm fine, yeah.

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
- Captain's very
disappointed in me.

33:50.999 --> 33:51.999
It's like having a father say
they're disappointed

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
in their son.

33:52.999 --> 33:53.999
- I'm sorry.

33:56.999 --> 33:58.999
- Okay.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
- Just enjoy it.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.999
- It's like, wait, wait,
was I the mistake,

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
or did you make a mistake?

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
- Cheers to our
great charter season.

34:10.999 --> 34:15.000
- Cheers.

34:15.999 --> 34:16.999
- Like, how do you think
I'm gonna feel about that?

34:16.999 --> 34:19.999
Like, okay, was I just
a piece of ass?

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
I think you're
a f***ing ass****.

34:21.999 --> 34:22.999
- Really?
Why?

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- What the f*** was that about?
- What was what about?

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
- Why did you come up here

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
and freakin' talk
about a mistake?

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
You know, you look
like an ass**** right now,

34:29.999 --> 34:31.000
and you were winning,

34:31.999 --> 34:32.999
and then you just
opened your mouth.

34:32.999 --> 34:33.999
I really liked you.

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
I think you're
f*** awesome,

34:34.999 --> 34:35.999
and I think you're
a really good guy.

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
I had feelings for you.

34:37.999 --> 34:40.999
You're just doing this
to be, like, malicious now.

34:40.999 --> 34:42.999
- Why does she feel like
the one who's been victimized?

34:42.999 --> 34:44.999
I'm not the one who's going
and, like,

34:44.999 --> 34:47.999
breaking up relationships
and f***ing people over.

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
I'm not the one trying
to go out there

34:49.999 --> 34:50.999
and destroy reputations.

34:50.999 --> 34:51.999
Well, I have to go
tell the truth

34:51.999 --> 34:53.999
to my girlfriend right now
back home, so...

34:53.999 --> 34:56.999
- So if that was
such a evil,

34:56.999 --> 34:58.999
then why did you even
go there with me?

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
- You knew I had a girlfriend,

35:00.999 --> 35:01.999
so why did you even
go there with me?

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
- Really?
Who initiated this?

35:03.999 --> 35:04.999
- Didn't you just say--

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
- Who initiated this?
- You did.

35:06.999 --> 35:07.999
- I did?
- Yeah.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.999
- How did I initiate this?

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
- Oh, I don't know,
maybe when you, like,

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
lifted your black skirt up
and you had nothing underneath.

35:13.999 --> 35:16.999
- Oh, my God.

35:16.999 --> 35:17.999
- Love it.

35:17.999 --> 35:18.999
- Good luck in life, bud.

35:20.999 --> 35:21.999
You're gonna need
a lot more than luck.

35:21.999 --> 35:24.999
- Yeah.
- Watch me go.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- There's a really good energy
on the boat right now.

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- 'Cause everybody's leaving?
- Yeah, probably.

35:48.999 --> 35:49.999
- Yeah.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
- Right here,
there's a good energy.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
- Oh, it's 'cause there's--
you're right, yeah.

35:53.999 --> 35:54.999
- Yeah.

35:54.999 --> 35:56.999
We've always been close.

35:56.999 --> 35:57.999
- Yeah.

35:57.999 --> 35:59.999
- And sometimes
even closer than close.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.999
- Yeah.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
- You deserve
a really good guy, you know?

36:06.000 --> 36:06.999
- I know.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.999
- And, like,
I'm not there yet.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
- I know.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.999
- I hope she can read
between the lines.

36:14.999 --> 36:15.999
I'm trying to let her go,

36:15.999 --> 36:18.999
and I hope that she
lets me go as well,

36:18.999 --> 36:22.999
because I really want her
to be happy,

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
and I'm not gonna
provide that for her.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- I'm not sure
you'll ever get there,

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
but that's who you are.

36:28.999 --> 36:31.999
- But I always want
to be there for you,

36:31.999 --> 36:33.999
as a friend, or whatever,
you know?

36:33.999 --> 36:35.000
- I know.
- Okay.

36:35.999 --> 36:39.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:39.999 --> 36:40.999
- Taking off, huh?

36:40.999 --> 36:41.999
- Yeah, thank you very much
for bringing me out.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.999
- Been a pleasure.
- Appreciate it.

36:43.999 --> 36:45.999
- I was really happy
that Captain brought me out.

36:45.999 --> 36:46.999
- Anytime you need me,
I'm here for you.

36:46.999 --> 36:47.999
- All right, buddy.

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
- And I hope he sees

36:48.999 --> 36:51.999
that I'm taking this career
seriously.

36:51.999 --> 36:52.999
- It was really good
meeting you.

36:52.999 --> 36:53.999
- It was really nice to have
a deckhand

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
that actually worked hard.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
- I hope I made life
a little easier for the crew.

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
- You take care.
- You do the same, buddy.

36:59.999 --> 37:00.999
- Don't be a stranger;
I'm gonna miss you.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
- Keep in contact.
- I will, I promise.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
- I really like this lifestyle.

37:04.999 --> 37:06.999
Any time you can head home

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
with a smile on your face
and a pocket full of cash,

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
what could be better?

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
- Still going
to California, Emile?

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- Yeah.
- You are?

37:14.999 --> 37:15.999
- Yeah, definitely.

37:15.999 --> 37:16.999
Why the f*** not?

37:16.999 --> 37:21.999
I do not give a f***...

37:21.999 --> 37:25.999
about what people think of me
going to California with Rocky.

37:25.999 --> 37:28.999
- That's a good hug.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
See you in Cali.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
- I don't have a f***ing
crush on her.

37:32.999 --> 37:33.999
Just friends with Rocky.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
Even though I know
I'm a hard-ass...

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- You're not a hard-ass;
you're a dick.

37:37.999 --> 37:38.999
There's a difference.

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
- I'm a hard-ass.
- No, you're a dick.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
- I'm a hard-ass.
- Anyways.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- Thank you for
when you caught me.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
I'm very excited
to see Emile go.

37:45.999 --> 37:48.999
I think I'd love to continue
a friendship with him

37:48.999 --> 37:49.999
through texting only.

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
Okay, bye.

37:50.999 --> 37:51.999
You're so annoying.

37:51.999 --> 37:54.999
- No, come on, come on.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
I say what I think.

37:56.999 --> 37:59.999
It might come across
as arrogant, but it's truthful.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.999
I am Emile,

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
and I am real.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.999
Rocky...

38:04.999 --> 38:05.999
I'll see you in California.

38:05.999 --> 38:06.999
To the rest,

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
I wish the best.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- Come here,
my little hot mess.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
I am gonna chill out
for a little while.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
I'm gonna do some traveling,

38:15.999 --> 38:16.999
and then get right back
into it,

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
hop on another charter season.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
There you are.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.000
I'm leaving with a lot
of thankfulness

38:22.000 --> 38:23.999
for things that happened
this season.

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
I'm thankful for Kate and I,

38:26.999 --> 38:30.000
how we were able to come from
so much tension last season

38:30.999 --> 38:31.999
to end up working
so well together.

38:31.999 --> 38:32.999
Thank you for everything.

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
I really enjoyed.

38:34.999 --> 38:35.999
I got a few goosebumps, but...

38:35.999 --> 38:36.999
- Oh, look!

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
- I really enjoyed
working with you so much.

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
- I know that Amy and I
are going to be in touch

38:40.999 --> 38:41.999
after this boat.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.000
- Bye.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.999
- We might be new best friends.

38:47.999 --> 38:48.999
- f*** you, did it.

38:48.999 --> 38:50.000
This was a bad season for me,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.999
through and through, everything.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.999
Leadership, decisions
I've made, weather.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
Everything about this season
was a poor season for me.

38:56.999 --> 38:57.999
- Stay in touch.

38:57.999 --> 38:58.999
- Oh, you know I will.

38:58.999 --> 39:00.999
- We're gonna do this again.

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
- All right.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
I'm pissed off,
the way things ended.

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
Only at myself.

39:04.999 --> 39:05.999
But I'm gonna go home

39:06.000 --> 39:10.999
and...deal with
what I have to deal with.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
- Farewell.
- Yeah, you as well.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
- Ben.
- Bye, take care, love.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
- I just have to say good-bye
to a couple people

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
and then leave for my flight?

39:38.999 --> 39:39.999
Booyakasha.

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
All right.

39:44.999 --> 39:45.999
Farewell.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
- Yeah, you as well.

39:50.999 --> 39:52.999
- Good luck in the future.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
- You too.

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- In eastern philosophy,

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
you're supposed to
love your enemy,

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
because they teach you
more than your friends do.

40:00.999 --> 40:01.999
I love you, Kate.

40:05.999 --> 40:09.999
I'm so proud that I
stuck it out this whole season.

40:09.999 --> 40:10.999
I'd never been a stew before...

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
That felt so good.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.000
And now I feel
like I'm Martha Stewart.

40:14.999 --> 40:17.999
But I'm happy it's over.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
Out of...here.

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
- Ta-ta!
- Bye.

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
- Later!

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
I never have to see
you guys again!

40:27.999 --> 40:30.999
- God, that chick is whack.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.999
the only constant is change.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
So you just never know
what to expect.

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
And when you first
get off the boat,

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
at first, it's like, run free!

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
But then you miss
the camaraderie.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
You miss the sound
of the ocean.

40:46.999 --> 40:47.999
You miss the rocking
of the boat.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.999
Thank you for being
my roommate

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
and so much fun
on this boat.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
- I think we actually were
pretty decent roommates.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
- Well, yeah,
you did all the cleaning.

40:54.999 --> 40:55.999
It was great.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.999
My top moments
of this charter season

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
were definitely
master foam party

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
with Connie and Amy,

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
Ben coming back,

41:03.999 --> 41:05.999
and working with Amy.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
Hey, Ben, I'm leaving.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
- Bye.

41:09.999 --> 41:10.999
- What?

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
- You're funny.
- Just kidding.

41:14.999 --> 41:15.999
- What's next for me is,

41:15.999 --> 41:17.999
I'm putting down
a little bit of land roots.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.000
Not too much;
I'm just getting a car.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.999
I'm gonna get a two-door
hard-top convertible,

41:21.999 --> 41:22.999
because I like the wind
in my hair.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
- Do you need a hand
with your bag or anything?

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
- No, I think I got it.

41:25.999 --> 41:26.999
- Okay, I'll get the door
for you.

41:26.999 --> 41:27.999
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

41:27.999 --> 41:29.000
- But not if I've spent time
on it.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.999
- I feel like this is a really
clean divorce with you two.

41:31.999 --> 41:32.999
- So clean.

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
- Take care.
- Bye.

41:34.999 --> 41:35.999
- I'll see you.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
I actually don't
want it to end.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.999
I just got started.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- We have had some screws loose.

41:46.999 --> 41:47.999
- Yes.

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
- Oh, my God.

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
But what else is new?

41:49.999 --> 41:50.999
- Yeah.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.999
- Hey, guys.

41:52.999 --> 41:56.999
Captain,
always a pleasure, mate.

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
- All right, buddy.

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
- Thank you so much.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, cheers.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
- Saying good-bye
to Captain Lee,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
it's making me realize

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
that I really do love
his program.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
I really like working for him.

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- Thanks for bailing me out.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.999
- Oh, no,
thanks for inviting me.

42:11.999 --> 42:12.999
- Now, get the hell
out of here.

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
- I will, don't worry.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
It's definitely a tough program,

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
and it takes tough people.

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
And I'd like to consider
myself as tough.

42:21.999 --> 42:22.999
Catch you on the flip side!

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
Ha-ha!

42:24.999 --> 42:26.000
- Now everybody's gone.

42:26.999 --> 42:27.999
- Yeah, the nuts have all
fallen off the tree,

42:27.999 --> 42:28.999
haven't they?

42:28.999 --> 42:30.999
- You have one dangling.

42:30.999 --> 42:31.999
- Yeah.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
- I wonder how long
she will last.

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
- We're about to find out.

42:34.999 --> 42:37.999
- I guess so.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
- Let's get to work.

42:40.999 --> 42:43.999
This charter season
had a lot of difficulties.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- Ow!

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
- Back off.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
- There's your ticket.

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
At the end of the day,

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
the guests were all happy.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
We made a ton of money
in tips.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
So we still had to be
doing something correct.

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
This industry
is just full of surprises.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.999
You absolutely have no idea
what's gonna happen next.

43:07.999 --> 43:08.999
With that being said,

43:08.999 --> 43:12.999
it's still the best
goddamn job in the world.
