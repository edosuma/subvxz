When you're burned,

no job history.

- Where am I?

- You rely on anyone

- [ Laughs ]

- a trigger-happy

- Should we shoot them?

on you to the F.B.I.--

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

focused on this.

All right.
Fair enough.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.025
You mind if I run with this?
The money's not bad.
No. Knock yourself out.

It's this job that I'm on.
I need some backup--

01:00.261 --> 01:03.063
- And you need a wingman.
- Damn straight, skippy.

you through all this?

I want to know
who did this to me.

They already killed two people.

Yeah. Sounds like
it's a bad time
for me to bail.

No, it's a perfect time

And not to get
into your business,

you could use the help.

she could be in any one

She'll let us know
where she is.

In any operation, communicating
silently is often essential.

Chalk marks,

A good trap doesn't scare

04:25.366 --> 04:27.501
A speeding truck
makes people scatter.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.471
A slow-moving truck,
on the other hand,

04:30.538 --> 04:33.006
makes people want
to take a closer look.

- [ Clamoring ]

05:03.537 --> 05:06.807

Yeah, well, that's intriguing.
What the hell does it mean?

05:30.964 --> 05:33.233
Without knowing
who they are,
hard to say.

They might want information.
They might have a job
they want me to do.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.539

they shot him for a reason.

Better be a good reason.

This is your place?
Yeah.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.754
Well, it's a foreclosure.
You know, I guess they ran
out of money in the remodel.

Come on, man. When she
starts smokin' in here, we're
never gonna get the smell out.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.744
