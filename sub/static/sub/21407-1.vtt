00:53.126 --> 00:55.782
Careful. You're
dripping juice on Spider-Man.

00:55.954 --> 00:57.565
The thing
about Spider-Man

00:57.566 --> 01:00.649
is that he'd be useless
in a place like Corrigan.

01:01.918 --> 01:03.043
How do you mean?

01:05.334 --> 01:08.418
There's nothing for him
to swing in between here.

01:08.548 --> 01:10.548
He needs an urban environment.

01:13.446 --> 01:16.211
That's why Superman is
the greatest superhero.

01:16.307 --> 01:17.555
He's all-terrain.

01:17.597 --> 01:19.763
Superman?
He's the worst superhero.

01:20.316 --> 01:21.732
Excuse me?

01:21.891 --> 01:23.813
Superman is boring.
He's invulnerable.

01:23.814 --> 01:27.219
That's why they invented kryptonite,
so he has some kind of weakness.

01:27.227 --> 01:29.640
Batman, he's the best superhero,

01:29.641 --> 01:32.974
because, well,
he's just a guy like me or you.

01:33.289 --> 01:36.391
He doesn't have any superpowers.
He's not superhuman.

01:36.392 --> 01:38.367
He has a cape and a mask
and arch-enemies.

01:38.368 --> 01:39.871
He's a superhero, no question.

01:39.872 --> 01:41.414
You're not listening, Chuck.

01:41.763 --> 01:44.430
Batman does not
possess superpowers.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.865
Therefore he's not super.

01:46.866 --> 01:49.751
You've lost your mind.
Batman is a master of martial arts.

01:49.752 --> 01:51.329
He's a detective,
he's an inventor.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.819
And given that 'super' only
means 'greater than normal',

01:53.820 --> 01:57.516
by that definition, Batman can
only be described as a superhero.

01:58.287 --> 01:59.662
You still here, Jeffrey?

02:00.114 --> 02:02.461
Go home, or your parents
will think we've stolen you.

02:02.524 --> 02:04.344
I was about to leave in disgust.

02:04.345 --> 02:06.720
You have a very irritating son,
Mrs Bucktin.

02:07.109 --> 02:08.211
Why, thank you, Jeffrey.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.937
He's been spitting pips
all over your tablecloth.

02:12.494 --> 02:14.182
Oh, you little bugger!

02:14.310 --> 02:15.977
Oh, Charlie!

02:38.494 --> 02:41.252
<i>"Courage is resistance to fear,"</i>

02:41.836 --> 02:45.323
<i>"mastery of fear,
not absence of fear."</i>

02:54.625 --> 02:55.750
Bed.

03:02.271 --> 03:03.438
Merry Christmas.

03:05.609 --> 03:06.942
Goodnight.

04:00.317 --> 04:02.317
Charlie.
Charlie.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.083
It's Jasper.

04:06.276 --> 04:08.557
- Who?
- Jasper Jones.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.463
What are you doing here?

04:11.474 --> 04:13.057
I need your help.

04:13.807 --> 04:16.307
Me? Why me?

04:17.875 --> 04:19.875
Come with me. I'll show you.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.169
Where?

04:24.255 --> 04:26.338
Hurry up, Charlie.
We've got to go.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.224
I'm right. Didn't hurt.

04:58.513 --> 05:00.263
- Come on. Follow me.

05:03.599 --> 05:06.573
<i>Why would
Jasper Jones ask for my help?</i>

05:07.018 --> 05:09.060
<i>He's never even
spoken to me before.</i>

05:09.923 --> 05:12.183
Jasper!
Where are we going?

05:14.203 --> 05:16.619
<i>People in town say
he's dangerous.</i>

05:18.549 --> 05:20.841
<i>But I've always wondered
what he's really like.</i>

06:04.318 --> 06:06.370
<i>I don't know where
he's taking me.</i>

06:08.072 --> 06:09.739
<i>Or why I followed him.</i>

06:12.200 --> 06:15.144
<i>And I don't know how I'm gonna
find my way back home.</i>

06:51.332 --> 06:52.511
I can trust you.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.565
- Right, Charlie?
- Trust me with what?

07:07.957 --> 07:10.832
Shh! Shh! Shh!

07:12.464 --> 07:14.919
I didn't do it!
I swear I didn't do it.

07:15.256 --> 07:17.950
I found her.
I found her here tonight.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.547
Charlie, I need your help.

07:23.815 --> 07:25.190
Help me.

07:25.771 --> 07:26.979
Who is it?

07:27.984 --> 07:29.443
It's Laura.

07:30.271 --> 07:31.646
Wishart?

07:31.953 --> 07:33.745
Eliza's sister?

07:35.401 --> 07:36.776
Yeah.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.270
I shouldn't be here.
We have to tell the police.

07:48.271 --> 07:49.714
No. No, we can't.

07:50.248 --> 07:51.029
Why not?

07:51.030 --> 07:53.568
Because they'll see that
she's been knocked around.

07:53.715 --> 07:55.465
That this is my place.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.583
That that's my rope!

07:58.716 --> 08:00.425
They're gonna say it's me.

08:01.425 --> 08:02.935
Jasper, they're the police.
They won't.

08:02.936 --> 08:04.311
Won't they?

08:05.373 --> 08:07.456
Who'd you blame first?

08:08.714 --> 08:10.506
Who did you blame first?!

08:13.268 --> 08:14.935
I can't tell them the truth.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.218
This is Corrigan.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.831
Nobody will believe me.

08:22.677 --> 08:24.177
But I thought you might.

08:26.209 --> 08:28.375
'Cause you're an
outsider like me.

08:28.491 --> 08:30.366
And you're smart.

08:32.505 --> 08:33.962
Please, Charlie.

08:35.294 --> 08:36.753
Help me.

08:38.869 --> 08:40.410
I think I know who did it.

08:41.874 --> 08:42.957
Who?

08:43.342 --> 08:44.508
Mad Jack Lionel.

08:44.896 --> 08:46.138
What, you think?

08:46.216 --> 08:48.195
Been walking past his
place for years.

08:48.271 --> 08:51.786
Sometimes I hear him calling out
my name. Waving like a lunatic.

08:51.979 --> 08:53.854
He's seen me with Laura too.

09:02.119 --> 09:03.702
What are you doing?

09:34.658 --> 09:36.325
We have to hide her.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.562
Jasper, we're not detectives.
We can't just solve this on our own.

09:41.646 --> 09:43.479
We don't have a choice.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.459
You think I want this?

09:46.083 --> 09:47.874
Nobody can know.

09:48.479 --> 09:50.021
Nobody.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.890
Not until we find
out who did this.

10:12.503 --> 10:14.003
Help me.

10:15.927 --> 10:17.552
She's still warm.

10:18.698 --> 10:20.156
Please, Charlie.

10:29.279 --> 10:30.695
Grab the rock.

11:21.979 --> 11:23.646
Charlie?

11:25.953 --> 11:27.495
Charlie!

11:30.679 --> 11:32.179
Charlie!

11:33.357 --> 11:36.691
- I'm up! I'm awake!
- Get up, or the bin gets your breakfast!

11:56.435 --> 11:58.059
<i>As the Apollo
12 astronauts</i>

11:58.060 --> 11:59.833
<i>head back to earth
from the moon...</i>

11:59.964 --> 12:01.422
You alright, Charlie?

12:03.418 --> 12:05.168
You feeling a bit crook?

12:06.794 --> 12:07.961
Charlie?

12:08.404 --> 12:09.669
I'm fine.

12:12.802 --> 12:14.427
What happened to your face?

12:16.714 --> 12:18.047
I cut myself.

12:18.048 --> 12:19.256
Sleeping?

12:19.487 --> 12:22.735
- Looks like a shaving cut.
- Don't be ridiculous.

12:24.547 --> 12:25.690
Is that what happened?

12:25.691 --> 12:27.482
Leave him.
He's embarrassed.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.930
I'll teach you how to do that
properly later, mate.

12:32.235 --> 12:33.818
The boy's growing up, Ruthie.

12:33.901 --> 12:36.883
Well, if you're not eating,
I suggest you head over to Jeffrey's.

12:36.969 --> 12:39.468
He's been around three times
already this morning.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.180
You know what I
don't understand?

12:46.181 --> 12:47.360
Mermaids.

12:50.224 --> 12:51.266
Chuck!

12:51.752 --> 12:53.688
- Chuck!
- What?!

12:53.768 --> 12:56.977
Mermaids. Why are they
considered so sexy?

12:57.170 --> 12:59.045
What are you talking about?

12:59.224 --> 13:01.057
It's because of their... their...

13:02.268 --> 13:03.750
Their boobies?

13:03.845 --> 13:05.852
Sure, but they're half a fish.

13:06.099 --> 13:08.391
You can deep-fry the
lower part of their body

13:08.392 --> 13:10.309
and that would be delicious.

13:11.002 --> 13:12.794
OK, hypothetical time.

13:12.885 --> 13:16.969
Would you rather have a magnetic
head or fart out of your mouth?

13:17.747 --> 13:18.955
Chuck?

13:19.201 --> 13:20.534
Chuck!

13:20.997 --> 13:22.539
Try this one.

13:22.899 --> 13:26.024
Would you rather have
a hat made of spiders

13:26.342 --> 13:28.800
or have penises for fingers?

13:31.219 --> 13:33.656
So you're choosing
the penis fingers, then?

13:33.750 --> 13:35.274
I'm avoiding
the question entirely.

13:35.275 --> 13:37.677
It's too stupid even
by your standards.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.594
- I've got the bat, man.
- Nice line there, son.

13:40.782 --> 13:42.352
Jeffrey,
don't take the new ball.

13:42.353 --> 13:43.853
No worries, Chuck.

13:43.994 --> 13:47.035
Yeah, good line.
Just need to work on the length.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.492
Pitch it up.
Pitch it up to him.

13:50.895 --> 13:52.687
Watch the footwork there!

13:53.352 --> 13:55.519
Eye on the ball!

13:56.102 --> 13:58.935
- Oh, fuck off, Cong!
- Oh, shit.

14:00.252 --> 14:01.656
Give it here.

14:02.477 --> 14:04.810
Yeah, cheers, Cong.
I'll have that.

14:05.423 --> 14:07.465
Actually, no, you can have it.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.586
No, Cong, just take it.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.212
Cong, I'm giving it to you.

14:12.673 --> 14:15.298
Actually, you know what?
You can have my shit ball.

14:15.381 --> 14:17.258
Good on you!

14:17.259 --> 14:19.467
- Yeah, Warwick!
- God, he's hopeless.

14:22.432 --> 14:24.057
Why does he always show up here?

14:36.524 --> 14:38.232
Why are we at Mad Jack Lionel's?

14:39.274 --> 14:40.548
Well, you
think it's true?

14:40.549 --> 14:41.591
What?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.465
That he murdered someone?

14:43.542 --> 14:46.042
Of course it is.
Everybody knows.

14:46.651 --> 14:48.234
Knows what?

14:48.883 --> 14:51.133
He came back from
the war deranged.

14:51.506 --> 14:53.215
He got addicted to killing.

14:53.628 --> 14:55.503
And that's why he worked
at the abattoir.

14:56.091 --> 14:58.008
That's where it all happened.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.590
What happened?

15:00.011 --> 15:02.886
They reckon that he shot a woman
and dragged her back there.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.531
They said that he hung her up
and bled her out.

15:06.621 --> 15:09.204
- Hung her up?
- That's what they say.

15:09.836 --> 15:11.544
How... how do I not know this?

15:11.965 --> 15:13.423
'Cause you're an idiot.

15:13.506 --> 15:16.006
Come on!

15:30.438 --> 15:31.938
<i>Ward Austin!</i>

15:32.085 --> 15:33.594
<i>Jackie Weaver...</i>

15:36.322 --> 15:41.113
<i>You will find out
on Personality Squares!</i>

16:06.751 --> 16:08.258
<i>Find out what you can.</i>

16:08.259 --> 16:10.009
<i>And don't say
anything to anyone.</i>

16:10.481 --> 16:12.273
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

16:23.071 --> 16:24.488
Oh, hello, Maureen.

16:24.828 --> 16:26.453
Yeah, yeah, we are,
but it's fine.

16:27.761 --> 16:30.636
No.
No, I haven't.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.985
Oh, my goodness. Really?

16:35.344 --> 16:37.297
Oh.
That's awful.

16:37.633 --> 16:41.154
Well, I mean...
Gwen must be beside herself.

16:41.448 --> 16:43.323
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:43.742 --> 16:46.844
No. No, I appreciate the call.
Yeah, thank you, Maureen.

16:46.969 --> 16:48.302
Yes, I will.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.946
OK. Bye.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.446
Charlie?

16:58.008 --> 16:59.953
- Could you knock?
- If you go to Jeffrey's tomorrow,

16:59.954 --> 17:02.141
I want you to stay on the street
so I can see you.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.125
- Why?

17:04.183 --> 17:05.484
Because I said so.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.047
Has something happened?

17:07.223 --> 17:09.348
Not anything that's
a concern of yours.

17:09.472 --> 17:10.811
But something has happened?

17:10.813 --> 17:12.921
Not anything that's
a concern of yours.

17:12.922 --> 17:14.464
Is someone in trouble?

17:14.711 --> 17:19.127
Yes. You, if you don't stop
giving me the third degree.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.438
Now, please, just do
as I ask tomorrow.

17:22.992 --> 17:23.992
Thank you.

17:24.548 --> 17:26.506
And clean up this room.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.090
Just joking.
It's... pretty neat.

18:41.756 --> 18:43.965
Ah.
Eliza Wishart.

18:44.173 --> 18:46.965
- Your book has come in.
- Thank you.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.591
It's
just under... here.

18:57.008 --> 18:58.594
OK.

19:16.716 --> 19:18.675
Ah.
Here it is.

19:40.026 --> 19:41.651
Thank you.

19:49.001 --> 19:51.376
Charlie, wait.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.131
I'll be out in a second.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.006
Sign there.

20:13.423 --> 20:16.173
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."
Have you read it?

20:17.422 --> 20:18.380
Me neither.

20:18.463 --> 20:21.547
I've seen the film three times, but
Mum won't let me buy the book.

20:21.657 --> 20:24.157
So I got Mr Daglish
to order it for me.

20:24.506 --> 20:27.688
I told Mr Daglish "Breakfast at Tiffany's"
is a book about a girl

20:27.689 --> 20:30.141
who's famous for
making omelettes.

20:30.465 --> 20:33.048
I don't think he's read a book
written this century.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.798
Have you seen the film?

20:34.904 --> 20:37.414
Audrey Hepburn is perfect.

20:37.517 --> 20:39.821
She's so pretty and dignified.

20:40.141 --> 20:43.214
I wish I was Holly Golightly in
my own apartment in Manhattan.

20:43.215 --> 20:44.500
I would love that too.

20:44.547 --> 20:48.005
Well, you could be Paul.
He lives next door. He's a writer.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.719
- That's what I want to be.
- Really?

20:51.256 --> 20:52.590
Well, that's perfect.

20:52.673 --> 20:54.742
We can go to the New
York Public Library together

20:54.743 --> 20:56.618
and sign a copy of your book.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.527
There's so many
policemen in town.

21:08.891 --> 21:10.599
You haven't heard?

21:11.692 --> 21:13.401
Heard what?

21:16.899 --> 21:18.816
It's because of my sister.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.923
What happened?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.923
She's gone missing.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.727
I didn't know.

21:28.951 --> 21:30.826
Do they know where
she might have gone?

21:30.873 --> 21:32.665
They don't know anything.

21:39.321 --> 21:42.250
I need you to take this.
Quick.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.742
Promise you won't read it
before me, OK?

21:44.857 --> 21:46.899
- OK.
- Just keep it safe.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.360
Stupid, stupid little girl!

21:53.509 --> 21:54.999
Where have you been?

21:55.071 --> 21:57.641
I was meeting Charlie at the library.
I told Dad before I left.

21:57.642 --> 22:00.024
Don't tell me lies!
Come with me, now!

22:14.696 --> 22:17.649
I told you to stay
in the street!

22:17.751 --> 22:18.664
Calm down.

22:18.688 --> 22:21.230
Don't you tell me to calm down,
Charles Bucktin!

22:22.490 --> 22:23.740
Where were you?

22:23.786 --> 22:25.516
- At Jeffrey's.
- Don't...

22:26.250 --> 22:27.542
Don't lie to me!

22:28.713 --> 22:29.980
I was just at the library.

22:31.690 --> 22:33.291
This is 'your' fault.

22:33.292 --> 22:35.083
This obsession with books.

22:35.494 --> 22:36.689
What did I say to you last night?

22:36.690 --> 22:39.104
I said stay in the street
where I can see you.

22:39.105 --> 22:40.487
- Ruth, come on, love...
- No!

22:40.488 --> 22:42.321
Don't undermine me.
This is important.

22:44.312 --> 22:46.937
There is a girl missing!

22:47.244 --> 22:48.660
Do you understand?

22:49.077 --> 22:50.952
Laura Wishart, Gwen's girl.

22:51.075 --> 22:53.291
No-one's seen her since Christmas Day.
Anything could have happened to her.

22:53.292 --> 22:57.041
And that is why I asked you
to stay close by!

22:57.439 --> 22:59.768
- I didn't know.
- Yeah, of course you didn't know!

22:59.769 --> 23:02.688
Because as much as you would like to
think of yourself as Errol Flynn,

23:02.689 --> 23:04.250
you're still a boy!

23:12.072 --> 23:14.197
<i>♪ The snow
upon the sleigh is falling ♪</i>

23:14.198 --> 23:17.781
<i>♪ Christmas in the air
Santa's here ♪</i>

23:18.072 --> 23:21.072
<i>♪ Hear the sleighbells ring

23:22.883 --> 23:25.266
<i>♪ ...sleighbells

23:25.267 --> 23:28.726
<i>♪ Hear them ring from
the depths of the valley... ♪</i>

23:40.446 --> 23:41.863
Hi, Jude.

23:48.501 --> 23:50.376
Chuck, pick a card.

23:50.946 --> 23:51.837
Pick a card.

23:51.868 --> 23:53.368
Just put them away.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.633
Everyone's attention,
please. Quieten down.

23:58.420 --> 23:59.920
Thank you.

24:00.837 --> 24:03.258
Firstly, I'd like to thank you
all for turning out this evening

24:03.259 --> 24:06.852
in response to what are some
very concerning circumstances.

24:07.102 --> 24:09.500
As many of you are aware,

24:09.657 --> 24:12.437
Laura Wishart, the daughter
of our shire president,

24:12.438 --> 24:14.500
Pete, and his wife, Gwen,

24:14.501 --> 24:17.016
has not been seen
since Christmas Day.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.414
So, tomorrow,

24:19.415 --> 24:21.498
with the assistance of
the West Australian Police Force,

24:21.499 --> 24:24.446
we will be conducting
a district-wide search,

24:24.447 --> 24:26.728
and we are asking that any of
you who can spare the time

24:26.729 --> 24:28.562
to please volunteer.

24:29.052 --> 24:33.552
Now, the muster point
will be here at 5:30 am.

24:33.666 --> 24:36.375
Spotter planes will
be in operation

24:36.498 --> 24:39.325
and dive teams
will be combing the river.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.614
Furthermore, all residents
who are under the age of 18

24:43.615 --> 24:46.823
must remain in their
homes after sunset.

24:48.497 --> 24:50.277
At this point,

24:50.278 --> 24:52.161
I'd like to hand over to
Pete Wishart to say a few words.

24:52.162 --> 24:54.662
It has to be magic.
I told you.

24:56.010 --> 24:57.427
Good evening.

24:59.205 --> 25:01.671
It means a great
deal to us to...

25:01.672 --> 25:04.005
see so many of you here tonight.

25:04.184 --> 25:06.114
It's particularly
humbling to see

25:06.115 --> 25:09.181
Brian and Sue Findlay
in attendance,

25:09.182 --> 25:11.974
having tragically lost their boy
Danny in Vietnam overnight.

25:12.740 --> 25:15.020
Now, I think I can speak
for the whole town when I say

25:15.021 --> 25:18.424
that our thoughts and our
prayers are with you both.

25:19.508 --> 25:21.830
At this time of year,

25:21.831 --> 25:24.122
we're all reminded of
the importance of family

25:24.123 --> 25:26.831
and the value of
community, but...

25:27.833 --> 25:30.541
it's never been more clear
to me than it is right now,

25:30.542 --> 25:33.596
and I just want to thank
each and every one of you

25:33.597 --> 25:36.931
for all your words
of compassion and support.

25:38.331 --> 25:40.854
Now, if any of you
have any information

25:40.855 --> 25:43.613
that might assist us
in finding Laura,

25:43.614 --> 25:45.822
please, just come forward.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.665
- I'm not hungry.
- Here you go. I am.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.213
Your boy
doing alright, eh?

26:00.214 --> 26:02.422
Stuffing his face like a pig!

26:03.723 --> 26:06.143
Is your boy alright?

26:06.643 --> 26:08.479
'Cause mine isn't.

26:09.357 --> 26:10.822
Mine's dead.

26:11.179 --> 26:12.720
My boy's dead!

26:19.260 --> 26:21.718
No, no, no.
No more, please.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.841
Your mother's staying here
to help pack up the hall.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.901
Nobody helped Mrs Lu.
They just watched.

26:39.174 --> 26:41.165
Thanks, Susan.
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:41.682 --> 26:43.971
Yes.
I know.

26:45.352 --> 26:46.727
Let's get home.

26:47.925 --> 26:50.846
Even the police saw what happened and
Miss Findlay can just walk away?

26:50.847 --> 26:52.639
Yes, I know. Just keep it down.

26:52.848 --> 26:55.140
- Mrs Lu didn't hurt anyone.
- I know.

26:55.318 --> 26:57.096
Let's talk about this
when we get home, alright?

26:57.097 --> 26:59.222
- Goodnight, Peter.
- Wesley.

27:00.346 --> 27:02.471
Come on, Charlie.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.432
What do you think happened?

27:14.399 --> 27:16.690
Truthfully...

27:17.800 --> 27:19.049
before tonight,
I would have thought

27:19.050 --> 27:22.479
the most logical likelihood
is that she's run away.

27:23.737 --> 27:26.385
I've taught Laura
for a few years now and...

27:26.757 --> 27:28.760
she's a bit remote.

27:29.823 --> 27:32.641
Wouldn't surprise me
if she'd skipped town for the city,

27:32.642 --> 27:34.526
and I hope I'm right.

27:35.372 --> 27:36.413
But...

27:38.244 --> 27:39.161
But?

27:48.005 --> 27:50.088
I shouldn't be
telling you this...

27:51.211 --> 27:53.170
but when they
searched her room,

27:54.396 --> 27:56.979
the window was wide open
and everything was a mess.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.468
And there was blood on the floor
and on her bed.

28:04.153 --> 28:05.861
So, I don't know.

28:07.221 --> 28:08.721
It's very concerning.

28:09.753 --> 28:12.211
Which is why there's
such a serious response.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.656
Do they have any suspects?

28:19.111 --> 28:20.986
No, not really.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.112
Although, I have heard talk

28:24.248 --> 28:26.248
that they're looking
for Jasper Jones.

28:27.538 --> 28:28.869
Wh-Why?

28:29.007 --> 28:31.716
Because they blame that poor kid
for everything.

28:35.544 --> 28:36.669
Wait.

28:38.039 --> 28:39.581
What are you working
on in there?

28:40.481 --> 28:41.939
In here?

28:44.096 --> 28:46.054
Well, I'm learning the bassoon.

28:47.279 --> 28:48.112
What?

28:48.182 --> 28:49.724
Yeah, that's right.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.974
Do you want to hear me play?

28:57.172 --> 28:58.256
Ooh.

28:58.823 --> 29:00.166
Sounds like more of a trumpet.

29:00.167 --> 29:03.917
Yeah, well, like I said,
I'm just learning.

29:04.505 --> 29:06.380
Goodnight, mate.

29:29.307 --> 29:31.432
Charlie!

29:35.607 --> 29:37.148
Jasper, where have you been?

29:37.502 --> 29:40.197
- What happened at the town hall?
- They're looking for you.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.307
I know.

29:41.549 --> 29:44.721
They've been staking out my old man's
place for the past two days.

29:44.839 --> 29:46.589
Can you come out?

29:46.744 --> 29:48.452
But there's a curfew on.

29:58.195 --> 29:59.362
Wait a second.

30:17.096 --> 30:18.596
Come on.

30:21.656 --> 30:23.740
The lights are on.
He might be home.

30:23.798 --> 30:26.267
Jasper, there's no way
I'm going in there.

30:26.362 --> 30:27.820
We're not going in.

30:29.302 --> 30:30.927
Just watching.

30:40.865 --> 30:42.823
It's... not my brand.

30:47.507 --> 30:48.885
Come on.

31:29.918 --> 31:30.859
What is it?

31:31.395 --> 31:33.145
Um... it's Pelham's.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.275
I think it's Irish.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.351
Nicked it from my old man.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.835
He goes through it so fast,

31:39.836 --> 31:42.169
doesn't notice
when it's missing.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.401
Are you worried he'll tell
the police where you are?

31:49.831 --> 31:51.665
He wouldn't have a clue.

31:51.818 --> 31:53.443
After my mum died...

31:54.748 --> 31:56.206
he just went to shit.

31:57.963 --> 31:59.463
Well, when did she die?

32:01.430 --> 32:03.055
When I was real young.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.057
Car crash.

32:08.485 --> 32:10.401
I don't remember her at all.

32:11.110 --> 32:13.401
I haven't even
seen a photograph.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.526
But I know she's where
I get my colour from.

32:19.044 --> 32:21.294
Her people aren't
from round here.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.555
Did you love her? Laura?

32:33.169 --> 32:34.961
We were planning
to leave together.

32:39.521 --> 32:41.104
When?

32:42.693 --> 32:44.276
As soon as we could.

32:46.469 --> 32:48.927
That's why I've been gone
these past couple of months.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.943
Been out Donnybrook way
picking stone fruit.

32:56.568 --> 32:58.610
Didn't get a chance
to tell Laura.

32:58.958 --> 33:00.541
Well, why not?

33:01.938 --> 33:03.521
There wasn't time.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.776
I couldn't go near her house
during the day.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.713
Think of that.

33:14.151 --> 33:16.735
I could only ever see her
when it was dark.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.789
It's like she was a dream
or something.

33:27.195 --> 33:28.778
I came back Christmas night...

33:30.737 --> 33:32.737
with enough money
to get us out.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.471
Went straight to her window...

33:40.443 --> 33:41.943
and she was gone.

33:42.943 --> 33:44.443
And then you came here.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.361
I heard her screaming.

33:54.455 --> 33:56.372
And then I found her.

33:57.732 --> 33:59.524
I never should have left.

34:00.735 --> 34:02.485
I should have stayed here.

34:03.026 --> 34:05.651
It's not your fault.
Enough people blame you already.

34:05.735 --> 34:07.164
Someone else did this.

34:07.242 --> 34:08.717
I let her down.

34:11.943 --> 34:13.693
Is that why you wrote that?

34:13.943 --> 34:15.117
What?

34:15.424 --> 34:16.900
On the tree.

34:28.802 --> 34:30.219
What does it say?

34:30.400 --> 34:31.943
Uh...

34:33.156 --> 34:35.938
- You wrote it, didn't you?
- What does it say?!

34:36.650 --> 34:38.275
It says "sorry".

34:39.596 --> 34:42.554
- You mean you didn't write it?
- No.

34:42.947 --> 34:44.364
Then who did?

34:44.755 --> 34:47.297
It had to be... it
had to be Mad Jack.

34:47.987 --> 34:50.112
He's been back here. Last night.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.841
What if he's here, Jasper?!

34:54.127 --> 34:56.918
Jasper, he could be right now!

34:57.158 --> 34:59.658
He could be here.
We have to go.

34:59.735 --> 35:01.352
- No, Charlie. Wait.
- I'm leaving!

35:01.353 --> 35:02.728
Charlie, wait!

37:03.408 --> 37:04.992
Wait. I want to go with you.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.958
Close that door.
You stay right where you are.

37:11.091 --> 37:14.661
- But why? I want to help.
- You can help by staying home and safe.

37:14.771 --> 37:16.209
You listen to your mother.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.750
Alright, come on.
Come here. Come here.

37:26.482 --> 37:27.940
Get inside.

37:28.651 --> 37:30.151
Come here. Come here.

38:05.099 --> 38:06.765
I'm going to Jeffrey's.

38:06.807 --> 38:08.307
Alright.

38:14.054 --> 38:16.263
Come on, boy!
Come on, then!

39:15.122 --> 39:16.806
Come here, you
little mongrel!

39:21.719 --> 39:23.136
Hey!

39:25.476 --> 39:26.685
Charlie!

39:28.622 --> 39:29.771
Hi.

39:29.810 --> 39:31.185
Uh, h-hi.

39:31.471 --> 39:33.721
I just came to renew
the loan on my book.

39:35.611 --> 39:36.849
My bag.

39:37.471 --> 39:38.638
What?

39:40.099 --> 39:43.154
Actually, uh... that's
not true at all.

39:43.795 --> 39:45.646
I've been waiting around here
the past couple of days

39:45.647 --> 39:47.107
hoping I might see you.

39:47.184 --> 39:48.351
What?

39:49.193 --> 39:50.693
Charlie, are you alright?

39:51.709 --> 39:55.042
I'm fine. Completely fine.
Nothing. It's...

39:56.213 --> 39:57.796
Is that a knife?

39:59.247 --> 40:00.474
No.

40:00.952 --> 40:04.005
I mean... I mean, yes, it is,
but it's not.

40:05.667 --> 40:08.005
Did you maybe want to
walk me home again?

40:08.124 --> 40:09.541
I can't.

40:09.786 --> 40:11.036
Really?

40:11.167 --> 40:13.042
I'm sorry, I have to go.

What happened?
Did they find anything?

41:40.338 --> 41:41.546
No.

41:42.101 --> 41:43.351
Nothing.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.029
Not even a trace.

41:45.030 --> 41:47.072
Jesus Christ, that poor girl.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.708
Jesus, Jasper, what happened?

42:27.565 --> 42:28.690
The sarge.

42:29.864 --> 42:31.614
The prick kicked me in the ear.

42:32.265 --> 42:33.932
It's still ringing.

42:35.893 --> 42:37.476
Sarge?

42:39.713 --> 42:41.755
I didn't think they'd
ever let you go.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.476
They didn't.

42:43.919 --> 42:45.053
So, how did you get out?

42:45.054 --> 42:48.013
Tricked
one of the city coppers.

42:48.476 --> 42:52.643
Told him I had to take a shit,
went straight out the window.

42:52.924 --> 42:55.174
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.515
They'll be looking for me
harder than ever now.

42:58.958 --> 43:00.874
I have to
show you something.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.669
Look.

43:11.935 --> 43:14.060
Look, it's the same as the tree.

43:14.435 --> 43:15.893
"Sorry".

43:17.354 --> 43:18.812
It says "sorry".

43:26.351 --> 43:28.226
What are you doing?!

43:28.435 --> 43:30.393
Jasper!

43:51.443 --> 43:54.276
Mmm. Yeah.
Nah, it's OK.

43:54.351 --> 43:57.716
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
My bag!

43:57.807 --> 44:00.390
- What?
- He's got my bag!

44:01.919 --> 44:03.419
Eliza's book.

44:17.838 --> 44:19.046
It was a bug!

44:19.208 --> 44:20.624
Who's there?

44:21.685 --> 44:23.060
Who's there?!

44:23.935 --> 44:25.310
Hey!

44:26.037 --> 44:28.662
Aarggh!

44:29.104 --> 44:30.479
Charlie!

44:32.612 --> 44:34.237
- Hey!
- Jasper!

44:36.029 --> 44:38.237
Get out of here,
you little bastards!

44:38.943 --> 44:40.771
I know you did it!

44:40.929 --> 44:42.596
I know you did it!

44:46.937 --> 44:48.599
Jasper?!

44:48.893 --> 44:50.419
We have to go back.

44:50.514 --> 44:52.755
He did it.
He killed her.

44:52.756 --> 44:54.797
I know, but you
can't even stand.

44:55.856 --> 44:58.158
We have to go back.
We have to.

44:58.159 --> 44:59.599
Not now.

44:59.804 --> 45:01.740
What about New Year's Eve?

45:02.213 --> 45:05.505
When everyone's at the
fireworks, we can go back then.

45:12.468 --> 45:14.093
Promise?

45:14.904 --> 45:16.362
I promise.

45:45.226 --> 45:47.060
Stay here.

45:50.185 --> 45:51.893
Charlie Bucktin.

45:54.189 --> 45:56.200
What are you doing here?

45:56.304 --> 45:57.189
Hmm?

45:59.268 --> 46:00.685
Get in the car.

46:02.268 --> 46:03.685
Come on.

46:25.433 --> 46:26.607
Oh!

46:26.726 --> 46:28.476
We didn't do anything wrong.

46:30.604 --> 46:33.062
- Hmm?
- I didn't do anything.

46:36.476 --> 46:39.351
Oh! Thank goodness!
I thought I'd lost you!

46:40.370 --> 46:42.044
Are you alright?

46:42.143 --> 46:43.601
Oh, God!

46:46.041 --> 46:47.916
Get inside.

46:57.029 --> 46:59.101
- Come on, inside.
- Jesus, Chuck.

46:59.102 --> 47:00.568
- Inside.
- Are you alright?

47:08.929 --> 47:12.138
Well, where were you?!
We were worried about you!

47:13.060 --> 47:14.794
Now... Hey!

47:14.890 --> 47:16.912
You said, "We didn't
do anything wrong."

47:16.913 --> 47:18.286
Now, who's "we"?

47:18.708 --> 47:20.166
Nobody.

47:20.827 --> 47:23.119
Do you think I'm playing
with you, son? Hmm?

47:24.112 --> 47:25.570
Who were you with?

47:26.897 --> 47:29.731
Charlie.
Tell the truth.

47:32.091 --> 47:33.263
Uh... Eliza.

47:33.353 --> 47:35.311
- Wishart?
- Yes.

47:35.778 --> 47:37.028
Why?

47:37.788 --> 47:39.205
Because I was worried about her.

47:39.257 --> 47:41.674
I... I just wanted to make sure
she was alright.

47:42.143 --> 47:45.685
We're... we're fond
of each other.

47:45.814 --> 47:48.689
"Fond of each other"?

47:51.810 --> 47:53.559
Did you ever
stop to consider

47:53.560 --> 47:56.100
that maybe the last thing the
Wishart family needs right now

47:56.101 --> 47:58.280
is a young man
prowling around their home?

47:58.281 --> 47:59.755
- Hmm?
- No, sir. I'm sorry.

47:59.756 --> 48:01.173
Sorry?

48:03.482 --> 48:06.107
So am I.
We're done.

48:07.538 --> 48:08.749
'Night, Romeo.

48:08.750 --> 48:10.875
We appreciate
you bringing him home.

48:17.827 --> 48:21.994
Now, Charlie, I think you need
to get to bed and stay there.

48:23.591 --> 48:25.392
What, that's it?

48:25.912 --> 48:29.100
No wonder he thinks he can cavort
around town whenever he feels like it!

48:29.101 --> 48:30.825
Ruth, he's growing up.

48:31.388 --> 48:34.059
You were slipping out to go
dancing with the G.I.'s at his age.

48:34.060 --> 48:36.419
That is completely irrelevant!

48:36.513 --> 48:39.356
He could have died, Wesley!
We don't know who's out there!

48:39.357 --> 48:40.724
I agree.

48:40.981 --> 48:43.286
But screaming at him
isn't gonna reinforce the point.

48:43.287 --> 48:45.435
What's your solution?
Do nothing?

48:45.518 --> 48:48.518
Just disappear in there and
write a bloody story about it?

48:48.593 --> 48:51.218
Wes Bucktin,
the disappearing man!

48:51.320 --> 48:54.818
You know, some of us can't just shut
the door and avoid living here!

48:54.947 --> 48:58.849
Oh, Jesus Christ! Are you two
ever gonna listen to me?!

48:58.932 --> 49:01.849
I am fed up!
Fed up!

49:02.912 --> 49:05.810
Now, I love you, Charles Bucktin,
and I am glad you're alive,

49:05.811 --> 49:08.030
but tomorrow,
you're gonna wish you weren't!

49:08.031 --> 49:09.888
Now, get out of my sight!

49:22.717 --> 49:25.099
Now.
Dig.

49:25.607 --> 49:27.677
What?
Why?

49:27.772 --> 49:29.240
Because I said so!

49:29.299 --> 49:32.049
- How deep?
- I'll tell you when to stop.

49:37.412 --> 49:38.745
Chop chop!

50:20.893 --> 50:22.872
I didn't say you could stop.

50:39.890 --> 50:42.832
What is this even for?
I don't understand why I'm doing this.

50:42.833 --> 50:45.943
Well, I don't understand you
at all, Charlie Bucktin.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.748
One minute you're avoiding me
like I'm contagious,

50:49.749 --> 50:52.146
the next you're telling people we're
sneaking out at night together

50:52.147 --> 50:54.575
because we're
romantically attached.

50:54.963 --> 50:57.422
You know, it's polite
to ask a girl first.

50:57.748 --> 51:01.165
- I can explain.
- Um, no.

51:02.154 --> 51:04.862
Excuse me. This is not on.

51:05.107 --> 51:06.747
I just came
to get something back.

51:06.846 --> 51:08.304
Well, it can wait.

51:08.685 --> 51:10.224
Charlie's working
very hard at the moment.

51:10.225 --> 51:12.142
Let him finish up, thank you.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.978
Go on.

51:17.226 --> 51:20.208
Does your mother know you're
traipsing around town on your own?

51:21.099 --> 51:24.015
I think you should be at home
right now, don't you?

51:29.990 --> 51:32.732
Right.
You can stop.

51:32.862 --> 51:34.612
Oh, no, you don't.

51:35.153 --> 51:36.903
I want you to fill it in.

51:37.428 --> 51:38.443
- What?
- Fill it in.

51:38.444 --> 51:40.659
I don't want some dirty great
big hole in my backyard.

51:40.660 --> 51:42.849
If you didn't want a hole,
then why did you ask for it?

51:42.850 --> 51:44.537
There you are,
you've learnt your lesson.

51:44.538 --> 51:46.185
Now, I'm heading out,

51:46.186 --> 51:48.410
and I want this filled in
by the time I get back,

51:48.411 --> 51:51.553
or you'll be doing it all again
tomorrow, young man.

52:04.935 --> 52:07.529
- What's this?
- I bought myself a car!

52:07.952 --> 52:09.724
Isn't she a beauty?!

52:09.854 --> 52:11.729
I don't understand, Ruth.

52:12.857 --> 52:15.107
You want to s...
do you want to sell the Holden?

52:15.204 --> 52:16.716
'Cause I'll need to get Ernie Banks

52:16.717 --> 52:18.706
to replace the crankshaft.
It's stuffed!

52:18.901 --> 52:21.651
No, I don't want you
to sell the Holden, Wesley.

52:21.799 --> 52:23.007
Then...

52:24.161 --> 52:26.880
So... who wants to come
for a spin? Charlie.

52:26.940 --> 52:29.982
Charlie, you'll need to get cleaned up.
Have you filled the hole in?

52:33.944 --> 52:35.278
Fine.

52:35.625 --> 52:37.084
I'll go by myself.

52:48.101 --> 52:50.310
Here you are, mate.
You get inside.

52:54.065 --> 52:55.482
Go on.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.469
Jesus, Dad!

53:27.553 --> 53:28.880
How are you doing?

53:28.948 --> 53:31.865
I'm tickety-boo.
Had a great day.

53:33.382 --> 53:34.882
Why would she make me do it?

53:35.354 --> 53:37.562
I should have buried
her in there.

53:38.159 --> 53:40.534
Mate, you scared her last night.

53:40.703 --> 53:44.037
You're a smart kid, but what
you did was colossally stupid.

53:44.291 --> 53:45.749
Today was...

53:47.099 --> 53:49.646
just her way of
telling you all that.

53:49.953 --> 53:51.537
And I don't blame her.

53:53.568 --> 53:55.068
So, whenever she gets back,

53:55.763 --> 53:57.896
I... think you should offer her
a sincere apology.

53:57.897 --> 53:59.841
You want me to apologise?!

53:59.842 --> 54:01.258
Yes.

54:03.885 --> 54:06.834
You should consider yourself
lucky that you've got a mother

54:06.835 --> 54:09.310
that cares about
you so very much.

54:09.515 --> 54:11.265
A lot of people never get that.

54:14.812 --> 54:16.857
So, do you want me
to make us some dinner?

54:16.980 --> 54:19.005
Haven't I been punished enough?

54:21.974 --> 54:25.224
You're just like
her, your mother.

54:25.624 --> 54:27.583
You're peas in a pod, you two.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.844
Go, Corrigan!

54:37.169 --> 54:40.011
Good turnout today.
It's a beautiful day.

54:46.011 --> 54:46.998
Where have you been?

54:46.999 --> 54:49.467
The game's almost over.
We're getting thumped!

54:49.468 --> 54:51.968
- Why are you padded up?
- I'm in next.

54:53.161 --> 54:54.503
- What?!
- I'm in next.

54:54.504 --> 54:58.046
I'm playing, officially.
Jeffrey Lu on debut.

54:58.153 --> 54:59.185
How?

54:59.513 --> 55:03.388
David Doe rolled his ankle,
so I'm in the 11. Yes!

55:03.888 --> 55:06.250
- So you're actually gonna bat?
- Sure am.

55:06.412 --> 55:08.666
We need 60 runs in a hurry.

55:08.813 --> 55:10.435
Jesus, Jeffrey. Are you nervous?

55:10.465 --> 55:13.896
No. But you should be.
Have you seen your girlfriend up there?

55:15.791 --> 55:18.708
So, go read her some poetry.
I need to focus.

55:18.770 --> 55:20.919
This town needs a hero.

55:21.262 --> 55:22.762
Go on, go!

55:28.666 --> 55:30.375
Sassy time!

55:36.166 --> 55:38.638
- Shot!
- Very nice.

55:53.570 --> 55:55.653
I was hoping you might be here.

55:56.322 --> 55:57.822
Really?

55:58.500 --> 55:59.916
Why?

56:01.200 --> 56:02.935
May I sit?

56:13.046 --> 56:14.754
What are you reading?

56:14.962 --> 56:17.607
Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland.

56:17.992 --> 56:19.492
Is it good?

56:21.736 --> 56:26.403
You know,
Alice really has an awful time.

56:26.818 --> 56:29.583
She's so lost and
nobody helps her.

56:29.874 --> 56:32.124
They're all so mean and selfish.

56:32.309 --> 56:34.892
Sounds like "Charlie's
Adventures in Corrigan."

56:35.353 --> 56:36.978
Eliza's too.

56:40.978 --> 56:43.645
You know, the annoying thing is

56:43.646 --> 56:46.105
I still kind of wish
you had come over.

56:47.836 --> 56:49.002
Really?

56:49.385 --> 56:52.427
Our house is so... empty.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.038
I'm sorry.

57:03.078 --> 57:05.060
I'm not a good person, Charlie.

57:05.122 --> 57:06.833
Don't say that.
You're wonderful.

57:06.916 --> 57:09.125
I'm not. I'm really not.

57:11.333 --> 57:13.200
I might have already
used it, but...

57:34.151 --> 57:38.192
Would you rather have a hat made
of spiders or penises for fingers?

57:44.541 --> 57:47.072
Are the spiders alive?

57:47.471 --> 57:49.846
Yes, and they're
poisonous and angry.

57:53.486 --> 57:55.119
Well...

57:55.304 --> 57:58.346
I'm gonna have to go with
the penis fingers.

57:59.299 --> 58:00.762
Wise choice.

58:00.919 --> 58:02.460
You too?

58:09.026 --> 58:11.859
So, where were you
really that night?

58:14.138 --> 58:15.893
That's out.

58:21.107 --> 58:23.518
That's Jeffrey!
He's actually gonna bat!

58:23.731 --> 58:25.189
Hmm?

58:26.357 --> 58:27.732
They never pick him.

58:28.554 --> 58:31.690
This is it.
This is his chance.

58:32.224 --> 58:34.932
Hey, look at that. Oh!

58:36.167 --> 58:37.612
You don't belong on
this field, mate.

58:37.736 --> 58:39.729
We're going home.
There's no point.

58:39.846 --> 58:42.846
Oh, let's go home. Hopeless.
See you, Marge.

58:44.049 --> 58:46.341
Look at them.
They're leaving already.

58:48.589 --> 58:50.057
You don't
belong here, Cong.

58:50.159 --> 58:52.013
- Come on.
- Come on, Will.

58:52.392 --> 58:54.350
He shouldn't even be here.

58:55.979 --> 58:57.138
That's hilarious!

59:01.437 --> 59:02.869
Come on, Jeffrey.

59:02.978 --> 59:04.228
Go on, Will.

59:07.635 --> 59:09.846
Ooh!

59:11.905 --> 59:13.455
Shot!

59:19.323 --> 59:21.054
Come on, Jeffrey.

59:21.291 --> 59:23.429
- Four runs.
- Beautiful!

59:32.671 --> 59:34.088
Four runs.

59:34.097 --> 59:35.556
Unbelievable!

59:36.276 --> 59:37.760
We can win this.

59:37.761 --> 59:39.428
How many points do we need?

59:39.429 --> 59:42.096
- Runs.
- How many runs do we need?

59:42.718 --> 59:44.112
A lot.

59:46.527 --> 59:48.527
He's seeding them
like a watermelon!

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.179
- You little ripper!
- Well done! Well done!

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:09.440
There's two balls left.
We need four to win.

01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:12.408
OK. Here's what we do...

01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:16.791
No worries.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.317
He's going to do it.
He's gonna beat them.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:21.600
Just take your time, son.

01:00:26.763 --> 01:00:29.013
Oh, that's got to be a wide!

01:00:33.888 --> 01:00:37.513
- Come on, ump!
- Oh, come on, ump!

01:00:37.976 --> 01:00:41.393
It's the last ball.
He has to, he just has to.

01:00:59.225 --> 01:01:02.142
Stumps!
Win to Corrigan!

01:01:03.388 --> 01:01:05.513
- What a champion!
- Go, Jeffrey!

01:01:05.986 --> 01:01:07.528
Yes!

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.672
Jeffrey!
Yeah, Jeffrey!

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.986
Charlie, would you really
sneak out to meet me?

01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:27.705
I would.

01:01:28.328 --> 01:01:31.245
Then how about tomorrow night?
At the New Year's Eve fair?

01:01:32.263 --> 01:01:34.679
During the fireworks?

01:01:35.278 --> 01:01:36.986
And bring my book.

01:01:37.497 --> 01:01:39.038
It's really important.

01:01:48.343 --> 01:01:50.540
- It's your turn. Come on.
- Anytime this week, Charles.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.249
I know.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:53.650
Hurry up.

01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:14.971
- Already?
- Again?

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:17.929
I'll add 'em up, Boys.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

01:02:18.072 --> 01:02:20.888
I never understood that whole
shooting fish in a barrel.

01:02:21.276 --> 01:02:23.929
Just why not drain them out?
Why bring guns into it?

01:02:24.096 --> 01:02:28.054
Oh, never underestimate a man's
dumb desire to shoot at something, love.

01:02:29.627 --> 01:02:31.752
Do you think Mad Jack Lionel
shot someone?

01:02:34.815 --> 01:02:36.523
Why would you ask that?

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.349
I don't know. I ju...

01:02:39.662 --> 01:02:41.953
Do you think he has
something to do

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.752
with Laura Wishart's
disappearance?

01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:47.935
What's that?

01:02:54.179 --> 01:02:55.763
Get out here!

01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:59.013
- Get out here, you rat!
- Come on!

01:02:59.065 --> 01:03:01.065
Stay here.
Stay inside.

01:03:01.893 --> 01:03:02.803
I'll call Sarge.

01:03:02.804 --> 01:03:04.260
You don't want to fight
this war on our turf, do you mate?

01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:05.448
Stay here, Charlie.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:06.469
You coward!

01:03:07.776 --> 01:03:10.947
Eh?
Yellow-skinned bastard!

01:03:12.138 --> 01:03:14.377
- Hey, you two!
What are you doing?

01:03:14.448 --> 01:03:15.848
Hey, stop it!

01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:17.791
Get out of my yard,
you bastards!

01:03:17.792 --> 01:03:19.555
What'd you call me? You...

01:03:19.556 --> 01:03:21.299
Enough!
Leave him alone!

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.825
- No, no, Jeffrey!
- Let me go!

01:03:22.826 --> 01:03:24.487
- Want some more, eh?!
- That is enough!

01:03:25.284 --> 01:03:27.388
- Fuck off, Bucktin!
- Stop it!

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.908
That's enough.
Stop it!

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.435
- Stop it, please!
- Weak as piss!

01:03:36.596 --> 01:03:38.388
You know there's a
fucking war on?!

01:03:39.096 --> 01:03:39.971
Oh!

01:03:40.054 --> 01:03:42.916
Pull your heads in! You should
be ashamed of yourselves!

01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:44.559
You fucking red rats!

01:03:44.561 --> 01:03:46.811
Clear out of here!
Go on!

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:50.666
Charlie! Charlie,
watch yourself!

01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:00.672
- Are you alright, An?
- I'm OK. Thank you so much.

01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:06.994
Charlie, I told you
to stay inside!

01:05:04.581 --> 01:05:05.914
Come in, son.

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:24.333
This is what I've
been working on.

01:05:29.877 --> 01:05:31.794
This is my novel.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.179
I'm almost finished.

01:05:36.885 --> 01:05:39.052
And I want you to be the first.

01:05:41.387 --> 01:05:42.970
The first to read it.

01:05:46.884 --> 01:05:48.592
Would you do that for me, son?

01:05:49.523 --> 01:05:51.065
I'd be proud to.

01:05:57.504 --> 01:05:59.087
- You're a good man.

01:06:04.757 --> 01:06:06.132
Now, go back to bed.

01:06:14.401 --> 01:06:17.346
Ooh. Made a mess
of the agapanthus...

01:06:17.624 --> 01:06:19.291
An?

01:06:19.513 --> 01:06:21.054
Excuse me, An.

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.138
It's very, very nice of you.
Thank you.

01:06:27.526 --> 01:06:29.447
- Sorry about last night.
- We are OK.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:32.698
They are helping, you know,
to fix the fence.

01:06:35.138 --> 01:06:36.979
What are you doing?

01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:40.599
See, while you're out
smooching girls,

01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:44.041
some of us are honing our skills
to keep...

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.592
the streets safe.

01:06:47.279 --> 01:06:49.237
Are you coming to
the fireworks tonight?

01:06:50.526 --> 01:06:51.697
Nah.

01:06:52.123 --> 01:06:53.957
Just going to stay here.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.447
Well, besides...

01:06:57.583 --> 01:07:00.374
the two biggest fireworks in
town are right here anyway.

01:07:02.315 --> 01:07:04.526
I am one of the true
masters, Chuck.

01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:06.457
- I was thinking about it,

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:08.666
and I know why Batman
is the greatest superhero.

01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:11.572
- He's not.

01:07:11.965 --> 01:07:13.225
But why?

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.283
Courage.

01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:17.487
- What?

01:07:17.489 --> 01:07:20.745
You see, Superman doesn't need courage
to stand in front of a bullet

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.912
because it can't
possibly harm him.

01:07:23.018 --> 01:07:27.226
But Batman, on the other hand,
he has more to lose.

01:07:27.648 --> 01:07:30.523
He has to overcome his fears
to save people.

01:07:38.677 --> 01:07:42.244
♪ Give me the
right to your heart ♪

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:45.333
♪ May we never part... ♪

01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:51.716
- OK, now, don't go too far.
- OK, Mum.

01:07:54.481 --> 01:07:56.981
♪ Just give me your love... ♪

01:08:26.893 --> 01:08:28.600
You ready?

01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:35.423
Jasper, wait.
What are we gonna do?

01:08:35.674 --> 01:08:37.095
We're gonna talk to the man.

01:08:37.174 --> 01:08:38.841
What?!

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:41.404
He has a gun, Jasper.
This is crazy!

01:08:41.805 --> 01:08:43.555
Lionel!

01:08:45.113 --> 01:08:47.697
- Jasper!
- Jack Lionel!

01:09:04.571 --> 01:09:06.321
Jasper, is that you?

01:09:06.865 --> 01:09:08.740
Yeah, it's me.

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:10.469
Can we have a word?

01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:15.673
Yeah, come on up.

01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:41.464
G'day. Who's this, then?

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:20.453
Sit down.

01:10:24.839 --> 01:10:27.089
Jasper.
What are you doing?

01:10:27.778 --> 01:10:29.445
Sit down!

01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:32.298
Alright, mate. Alright, alright.

01:10:33.016 --> 01:10:34.474
Alright.

01:10:34.711 --> 01:10:38.086
Now, just... just... just
be careful.

01:10:43.619 --> 01:10:45.244
I know what you did.

01:10:50.052 --> 01:10:51.427
Oh.

01:10:52.111 --> 01:10:55.320
So, you admit it?
You admit you killed her?!

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.000
Yeah.

01:11:02.623 --> 01:11:06.040
I wanted to...
come and see you, but...

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:10.388
your dad would
have never allowed.

01:11:10.482 --> 01:11:12.649
What's my old man got
to do with this?!

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:16.768
Well, he's... he's never
forgiven me and he never will.

01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:19.958
Forgive you for what?
For Laura?!

01:11:20.607 --> 01:11:23.065
Laura? No, your mum's
name was Rosie.

01:11:23.203 --> 01:11:25.619
You mention my mother again
and I'll put one in your head!

01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:27.580
Jasper, don't!

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.440
What about the woman
at the abattoir?

01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:34.318
What woman at the abattoir?

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:38.391
After the war, when
you worked there.

01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:40.814
You hung her up like Laura.

01:11:44.841 --> 01:11:48.633
No, son, I'm not...
I'm not following you at all.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.869
When you... when you wrote "sorry"
on the car out there, you...

01:11:55.047 --> 01:11:56.463
Yes?

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:05.094
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:08.450
Yeah, I do.
You killed Laura Wishart!

01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:10.893
Mate, I don't even
know who she is.

01:12:10.982 --> 01:12:12.690
Sit down!

01:12:17.548 --> 01:12:19.423
Son, maybe you can help us.

01:12:20.885 --> 01:12:24.362
You... go and grab that
picture up there.

01:12:28.888 --> 01:12:30.263
Show it to Jasper.

01:12:31.464 --> 01:12:32.881
Take a look. You take a look.

01:12:33.184 --> 01:12:36.017
See, that there's Rosie.
She's your mum.

01:12:36.234 --> 01:12:38.359
Yeah? She's holding 'you', mate.

01:12:40.057 --> 01:12:43.432
You recognise your dad?
Yeah?

01:12:45.002 --> 01:12:46.752
See, he's my son.

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:50.174
Bullshit!

01:12:50.263 --> 01:12:52.305
Jasper, he's your grandfather.

01:12:56.044 --> 01:12:57.783
Liar! You fucking liar!

01:12:57.839 --> 01:12:59.893
- No, Jasper, don't.
- Step back!

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:05.408
Jasper, you can do as you wish
with that firearm, but...

01:13:05.523 --> 01:13:08.518
will you listen to me
first, please?

01:13:11.259 --> 01:13:14.717
There's something you need to know.
Something I'm ashamed of.

01:13:16.794 --> 01:13:18.211
But I've got to tell you.

01:13:21.256 --> 01:13:22.714
Alright?

01:13:26.854 --> 01:13:31.438
Mate, I disowned your dad
when he married your mum.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:37.915
That's why he took her name,
you see? Jones.

01:13:38.739 --> 01:13:41.781
That's why he's never been
back here, not even once.

01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:45.851
But after your grandmother
passed away, ' my wife'

01:13:45.935 --> 01:13:49.969
after she died, Rosie
started driving around here

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:53.554
to look after me and
to cook for me.

01:13:54.896 --> 01:13:57.977
That's when I realised
how wrong I'd been about her.

01:13:58.111 --> 01:14:00.361
I'd been so wrong about her.

01:14:00.786 --> 01:14:04.494
Yeah, we used to sit together
for hours sometimes.

01:14:06.997 --> 01:14:08.872
I adored her.

01:14:13.767 --> 01:14:16.142
But then one day, mate,
she, um...

01:14:17.896 --> 01:14:19.571
she was suddenly
in a lot of pain

01:14:19.572 --> 01:14:24.256
and she was grabbing at her
sides and she was gasping.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:26.781
She collapsed.
I had to pick her up.

01:14:26.849 --> 01:14:29.057
I got her up and I got
her into the car.

01:14:30.236 --> 01:14:32.070
And she was screaming.

01:14:32.541 --> 01:14:34.166
And I panicked.

01:14:35.869 --> 01:14:37.369
And, uh...

01:14:40.594 --> 01:14:44.469
I drove too fast, mate.
I just drove much too fast.

01:14:47.089 --> 01:14:49.173
We hit a patch of gravel.

01:14:55.227 --> 01:14:57.185
And she died. I killed her.

01:15:02.923 --> 01:15:06.381
I always wanted to say
how sorry I... am.

01:15:07.562 --> 01:15:09.437
I'm just so sorry.

01:15:36.508 --> 01:15:37.657
Jasper, I...

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:39.242
Just go!

01:16:49.235 --> 01:16:51.649
- What are you doing?!
- Charlie!

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:53.530
- You don't say a thing, you understand?
- Shut up!

01:16:53.531 --> 01:16:55.554
What are you doing here?!
You shouldn't be here.

01:16:55.555 --> 01:16:57.188
No, you shouldn't be here!

01:16:57.657 --> 01:16:58.921
No, no, no. It's not
what you think...

01:16:58.922 --> 01:17:00.471
Do not touch me!

01:17:00.868 --> 01:17:02.118
We are going home!

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.852
You do not get to
tell me what to do!

01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:05.826
And you, you should
be doing your job!

01:17:07.049 --> 01:17:08.098
Charlie!

01:17:10.695 --> 01:17:12.278
Oh, shit!

01:18:32.438 --> 01:18:34.266
Eliza, I'm sorry.

01:18:34.369 --> 01:18:35.784
Everything is a mess.

01:18:36.172 --> 01:18:37.880
Where were you?!

01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:41.149
Eliza...

01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:42.657
Why can't you ever answer me?

01:18:42.658 --> 01:18:44.533
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:50.042
Just go home, Charlie.

01:18:50.986 --> 01:18:53.570
Eliza, wait.
Wait.

01:18:55.032 --> 01:18:56.532
You've got to come with me.

01:18:57.792 --> 01:19:00.001
There are some things
I need to tell you.

01:19:00.221 --> 01:19:02.008
About Laura.

01:19:02.489 --> 01:19:04.281
I know where she is.

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:06.751
What?

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:09.541
Please come out.
I-I can make it right.

01:19:09.719 --> 01:19:11.177
I'll show you.

01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:13.903
Come on.

01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:42.084
It's through here.

01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:43.917
Charlie, how do you know?

01:19:43.989 --> 01:19:46.822
I'll explain everything.
I have to show you.

01:20:06.662 --> 01:20:08.079
Eliza...

01:20:10.323 --> 01:20:12.573
I have to tell you something
about Laura.

01:20:15.138 --> 01:20:16.555
She's dead.

01:20:18.125 --> 01:20:19.625
She died right here.

01:20:20.959 --> 01:20:22.376
I know.

01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:26.282
It's my fault.

01:20:32.188 --> 01:20:33.646
What's she doing here?!

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.211
- You know him?
- That's what I wanted to say.

01:20:36.212 --> 01:20:37.328
Why'd you bring her here?!

01:20:37.329 --> 01:20:39.134
I've been here before.

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:40.204
What?

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:42.794
Jasper, she knows.

01:20:43.065 --> 01:20:44.680
- You told her?
- No!

01:20:44.774 --> 01:20:46.594
I know everything.

01:20:47.415 --> 01:20:50.954
Except why you left my sister.
How could you?

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:52.656
She loved you.

01:20:52.746 --> 01:20:55.037
- I didn't leave her!
- Yes, you did.

01:20:59.828 --> 01:21:01.539
Charlie, did you bring my book?

01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:02.664
Yes.

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.325
Right here.

01:21:18.558 --> 01:21:19.974
It's for you.

01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:39.232
Charlie?

01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:57.107
"Jasper Jones,"

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:59.126
"You came to my window"

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:02.498
"and you were gentle
and you were kind."

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.167
"But then you didn't
come anymore."

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:09.640
"You came to my window
and you saved me,"

01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:13.516
"because the nights you didn't,
my father came to my door..."

01:22:15.454 --> 01:22:19.204
"and he wasn't gentle,
he wasn't kind."

01:22:20.638 --> 01:22:24.055
"He betrayed me again and again."

01:22:24.425 --> 01:22:27.133
"And now that betrayal lives..."

01:22:35.035 --> 01:22:38.118
"and now that betrayal
lives and grows inside me."

01:22:39.464 --> 01:22:41.589
"I can't forgive him"

01:22:42.037 --> 01:22:44.037
"and I can't forgive you."

01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:48.508
"You promised we would
leave together."

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:51.907
"Now I have to leave on my own."

01:22:56.126 --> 01:23:00.084
- On that night,
my father pushed his way in.

01:23:02.094 --> 01:23:04.376
She was yelling and
he kept telling her to be quiet,

01:23:04.377 --> 01:23:05.758
but she wouldn't.

01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:08.792
And then he hit her.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.927
And she kept screaming
and screaming, and...

01:23:12.928 --> 01:23:16.261
and then he was yelling too,
and then everything went silent.

01:23:19.751 --> 01:23:21.751
Later, I heard her sneaking out.

01:23:23.571 --> 01:23:25.446
I followed her...

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.042
all the way here.

01:23:33.589 --> 01:23:35.255
I saw her climb up...

01:23:37.654 --> 01:23:40.029
and sit on that branch
for a long time.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.149
And she just...

01:23:48.253 --> 01:23:49.836
seemed really calm.

01:23:53.422 --> 01:23:55.422
I should have stopped her.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.602
Then she just dropped.

01:24:04.091 --> 01:24:06.758
I ran to her,
but I was too late.

01:24:11.074 --> 01:24:12.699
Then I heard someone coming.

01:24:14.902 --> 01:24:17.527
So I picked up the letter
and ran back home.

01:24:20.948 --> 01:24:23.448
I came back the next night,
but she was gone.

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:28.685
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

01:24:43.316 --> 01:24:45.566
- Jasper!
- What is he doing?

01:25:17.222 --> 01:25:18.805
Jasper, stop!

01:25:37.094 --> 01:25:39.969
Laura. Laura...

01:26:44.563 --> 01:26:46.438
So,
you wrote "sorry"?

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:49.660
- Yes.
I should have helped her.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.737
- Well, we have to tell someone.

01:26:51.867 --> 01:26:55.951
We can't trust Sarge.
But there has to be someone.

01:27:01.022 --> 01:27:02.480
Eliza?

01:27:03.422 --> 01:27:04.743
Has he ever...?

01:27:04.818 --> 01:27:06.031
No.

01:28:56.657 --> 01:28:58.407
She can't do that!

01:29:01.346 --> 01:29:02.971
Charlie, you have to go.

01:29:09.256 --> 01:29:11.381
Charlie, you have to go now.

01:29:28.748 --> 01:29:30.164
Eliza, wait.

01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:31.889
I'll see you soon.

01:29:48.668 --> 01:29:50.085
What do you want?

01:31:35.493 --> 01:31:37.368
What are you doing
here, Charlie?

01:31:37.761 --> 01:31:39.011
I need to talk to you.

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.522
It's about Eliza.

01:31:43.743 --> 01:31:44.914
I'm worried about her. I just...

01:31:44.974 --> 01:31:46.797
Sarge.
The Wishart place is on fire.

01:31:50.222 --> 01:31:52.263
It's gonna have to wait.
Alright?

01:31:52.378 --> 01:31:53.211
OK.

01:33:23.802 --> 01:33:25.511
Charlie, wait.

01:33:26.154 --> 01:33:28.305
Please. Come on.

01:33:28.657 --> 01:33:30.282
Where have you been?

01:33:31.868 --> 01:33:33.451
And you're leaving?

01:33:36.326 --> 01:33:38.951
I had a long talk
with your dad, and...

01:33:40.651 --> 01:33:42.437
we decided it's
best if, um...

01:33:42.447 --> 01:33:45.117
if I just stay up in the city
for a while.

01:33:45.238 --> 01:33:46.738
Good.

01:33:47.993 --> 01:33:49.451
Charlie...

01:33:51.529 --> 01:33:53.529
I just need to explain...

01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:57.386
I am so sorry.

01:34:00.329 --> 01:34:03.031
What I've done is just...
it's disgraceful

01:34:03.032 --> 01:34:05.657
and you should never
have had to...

01:34:08.074 --> 01:34:09.865
Oh, God.

01:34:11.782 --> 01:34:14.907
You're growing up so fast.

01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:19.031
What happened to my little boy?

01:34:20.618 --> 01:34:24.910
You've got your whole life
ahead of you, all you kids.

01:34:26.409 --> 01:34:27.950
You're so free.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.594
You know, when I first heard

01:34:33.595 --> 01:34:36.220
that Laura Wishart
might have run away...

01:34:41.238 --> 01:34:42.766
I was jealous.

01:34:42.864 --> 01:34:45.447
That's an awful thing to say,
but I just...

01:34:46.086 --> 01:34:47.919
it's how I feel.

01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:53.890
I love you... so much.

01:34:57.005 --> 01:34:58.922
And I love your father.

01:35:01.136 --> 01:35:04.469
I just can't be in
this place anymore.

01:35:04.695 --> 01:35:06.820
I know.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.957
God!

01:36:06.104 --> 01:36:07.979
