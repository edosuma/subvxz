<i>Clarence? Clarence? Clarence?</i>

01:55.500 --> 01:58.100
<i>l heard you the first time,</i>
<i>This better be good,</i>

01:58.400 --> 02:00.500
<i>l wouldn't be bothering someone</i>
<i>with your busy schedule</i>

02:00.800 --> 02:02.600
<i>if l didn't think it was at least</i>
<i>a Code Two,</i>

02:02.800 --> 02:04.600
<i>Famines and floods are Code Two,</i>

02:04.800 --> 02:06.600
<i>Tornadoes and earthquakes</i>
<i>are Code Two,</i>

02:06.900 --> 02:08.900
<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>so maybe it's a Code Three,</i>

02:09.199 --> 02:10.900
<i>l haven't memorized</i>
<i>the manual yet,</i>

02:11.100 --> 02:13.100
<i>Well, memorize it</i>
<i>and get back to me,</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.000
B <i>ut by then it will be too late,</i>

02:15.200 --> 02:17.500
<i>And a lot of people's Christmases</i>
<i>will be ruined forever</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:20.200
- <i>and l'll never get my wings</i>--
- <i>All right, All right,</i>

02:20.500 --> 02:22.300
<i>Just stop talking</i>
<i>and show me what you got,</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:25.000
<i>And it better be good,</i>

02:25.900 --> 02:28.900
<i>Here we come a-caroling</i>
<i>Among the leaves so green</i>

02:29.900 --> 02:31.800
<i>Miriam, Where are we?</i>

02:32.100 --> 02:35.600
<i>This is West</i> B <i>everly High</i>
<i>and those kids walking down the hall</i>

02:35.800 --> 02:39.100
<i>are the West</i> B <i>everly High</i>
<i>Madrigal Singers,</i>

02:39.500 --> 02:41.300
<i>A happy New Year</i>

02:41.700 --> 02:45.500
<i>And God send you</i>
<i>A happy New Year</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:50.000
<i>God bless the master of this house</i>
<i>Likewise the mistress too</i>

02:51.300 --> 02:54.800
<i>That's David Silver</i>
<i>with the video camera,</i>

02:55.200 --> 02:57.500
<i>And that's his girlfriend,</i>
<i>Donna Martin,</i>

02:57.800 --> 03:00.500
<i>an angel on earth</i>
<i>if ever there was one,</i>

03:04.600 --> 03:06.800
<i>Oh, l just love the holidays,</i>

03:07.000 --> 03:09.700
<i>l remember when l was a little girl,</i>
<i>we used to sing</i>--

03:10.100 --> 03:12.900
- <i>Miriam,</i>
- <i>Sorry, Moving on,</i>

03:15.400 --> 03:19.100
<i>Now here's Dylan and Kelly</i>
<i>and</i> B <i>renda</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:20.700
<i>and they are the best of friends,</i>

03:21.000 --> 03:22.900
Hello, guys,
wrapping presents today?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.200
Oh, sorry.
Here comes Geraldo Junior.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
Bren, you got a minute
for an interview?

03:28.900 --> 03:31.900
- Sure.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, Bren.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.100
So all the money we've raised
has gone to buy these toys for the kids

03:35.400 --> 03:36.900
at the Alvarado Street
Elementary School,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.900
and which Santa's helpers have been
busy wrapping for the past two weeks.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.600
Oh, don't forget to say
this is a West Beverly tradition.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.900
That's our senior class liaison for
this year's adopt-a-school programme.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.100
Take it away, Donna.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.100
No, that's okay,
l don't have anything else--

03:49.400 --> 03:50.600
<i>These kids have problems?</i>

03:50.700 --> 03:52.700
<i>They're too good-looking</i>
<i>to have problems,</i>

03:53.000 --> 03:55.900
<i>Well, according to section 1 6</i> B
<i>of the manual:</i>

03:56.200 --> 03:59.300
<i>''Physical appearance should not be</i>
<i>used to determine worthiness, ''</i>

03:59.700 --> 04:01.900
<i>Thank you for explaining</i>
<i>that to me, Miriam,</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:04.400
- <i>l was just making a comment,</i>
- <i>Sorry,</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:08.800
<i>'Twas the day before midterms</i>
<i>And all through the school</i>

04:09.000 --> 04:11.100
<i>The teachers were jamming</i>
<i>The students were cool</i>

04:11.300 --> 04:14.100
- <i>Who are they?</i>
- <i>The editors of the school newspaper,</i>

04:14.400 --> 04:16.300
<i>The</i> Blaze <i>staff kicked butt</i>
<i>To put the paper to bed</i>

04:16.600 --> 04:19.700
<i>While visions of vacations</i>
<i>Danced in their heads</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:21.700
For the record,
l just want to make it clear,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.600
they did not learn this
in Honours English.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.200
We did.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.100
<i>A troublemaker, huh?</i>

04:31.400 --> 04:33.900
<i>Well, Steve gets into his fair share</i>
<i>of trouble,</i>

04:34.200 --> 04:36.500
<i>but he's the only one</i>
<i>l'm not worried about,</i>

04:36.700 --> 04:38.200
You know, l walk into that detention

04:38.400 --> 04:40.600
and my watch stops.
Time stands still.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.900
lt's lethal in there.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.600
Well, we finished wrapping the gifts for
the Alvarado Street kids in record time.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.300
Now all we need is a Santa.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.000
Hey, don't look at me.
l'm covering the event for the B <i>laze</i>.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.400
l'm taping the whole thing,
so you can count me out.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.100
Donna, you know l'd love to do it

04:58.300 --> 05:01.500
but l'm barred from all school
activities until the end of time.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.500
That leaves only one person, Donna.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.700
Dyl-wig.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.000
''Ho!'' like a Santa.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.300
No. No. No.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.600
<i>Nice group of kids, don't you think?</i>

05:14.800 --> 05:16.600
<i>What l think is you're</i>
<i>wasting my time,</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:18.100
<i>These kids don't need any help,</i>

05:18.400 --> 05:19.600
<i>Well, sure, they look fine there</i>

05:19.800 --> 05:21.700
<i>but that was two days ago,</i>
<i>Look at them now,</i>

05:22.000 --> 05:23.500
<i>Deck the hall with boughs of holly</i>

05:24.900 --> 05:26.100
<i>What's wrong with them?</i>

05:26.400 --> 05:27.700
<i>Not them, Them,</i>

05:27.900 --> 05:30.200
- <i>Yeah, they don't look so festive,</i>
- <i>See?</i>

05:30.500 --> 05:32.200
- <i>l told you,</i>
- <i>So?</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:35.700
<i>lt's a routine example</i>
<i>of seasonal apathy and depression,</i>

05:36.100 --> 05:38.000
<i>Happens all the time</i>
<i>during the holidays,</i>

05:38.200 --> 05:41.000
<i>The man upstairs doesn't have time</i>
<i>for a bunch of self-absorbed kids</i>

05:41.400 --> 05:44.500
- <i>and neither do l,</i>
- <i>Wait, Clarence, come on,</i>

05:44.800 --> 05:46.900
<i>This is much more serious</i>
<i>than you think,</i>

05:47.200 --> 05:50.500
<i>At least give me a chance</i>
<i>to make a presentation,</i>

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
<i>Oh, please,</i>

05:52.100 --> 05:54.300
<i>You know, l'm missing</i>
Circus Of The Stars <i>for this,</i>

05:54.500 --> 05:57.800
<i>Once you see the bigger picture,</i>
<i>you'll be hooked, l promise,</i>

05:58.100 --> 05:59.300
<i>Just give me the highlights,</i>

05:59.500 --> 06:01.400
<i>Save the rest for the reunion movie,</i>

06:01.600 --> 06:05.100
<i>Okay, well, let's go back a couple</i>
<i>of days,</i>

06:05.500 --> 06:07.900
B <i>randon and Andrea</i>
<i>are the editors of the newspaper,</i>

06:08.200 --> 06:09.300
<i>l know who they are, Miriam,</i>

06:09.500 --> 06:12.100
So, Andrea, what's the lead story
in your special Christmas edition?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.900
An exclusive interview
with Ms. Claus.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.000
lt is the Year of the Woman
up in the North Pole.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.200
Don't mind her, she's on a roll.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.300
What can l say, l lost my crutches
and l regained my sense of humour.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.400
<i>Now, this phone call is</i>
<i>from her grandma,</i>

06:23.700 --> 06:25.300
<i>See, she lives</i>
<i>with her grandmother so she</i>--

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
<i>Let me listen,</i>

06:26.800 --> 06:28.300
Hello. <i>West</i> B <i>everly</i> B <i>laze</i>.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.500
Did you open it?
No. Don't, open it, Grandma.

06:32.700 --> 06:33.900
lt's a letter from Yale.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.900
Look, is it a thick envelope,
or a thin envelope?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
Thanks for calling, Grandma.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.300
Yeah, have a good kaluki game.
l'll see you when you get home, okay?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
Okay, great.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.800
Thin envelope, huh?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.500
Well, at least there was a letter
from Jay, the mail's not all that bad.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.600
Hey, you don't know
what it says yet.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.400
Look, Gil, we all know that
a thick envelope means you got in,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.100
and a thin envelope means
''We regret to inform you, but...''

07:09.400 --> 07:12.400
Yeah, but that's what they
should say in your case, right?

07:12.700 --> 07:15.400
No way. They must have a different
system for early admission.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.500
l bet they just took one look
at her application and said, ''Reject.''

07:19.800 --> 07:22.300
l'll bet you she got accepted.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.200
How much?

07:24.800 --> 07:26.600
You wanna bet me?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.700
For money?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.300
No, we should let Andrea
set the stakes.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.700
We should let Andrea
jump off a bridge.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.600
l think we should go to Andrea's
house right now and check this out

07:37.800 --> 07:40.400
before you leap to any conclusions.
What do you say?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.900
l can't open it.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.600
- l can't.
- Fine, l'll open it.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.000
No.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.100
Okay. No. You know what,
l'm gonna open Jay's letter first.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.500
Andrea, open the letter.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.000
Okay. Okay, l'm gonna do it.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.400
Here goes nothing.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.600
l can't handle this.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.000
So, what does it say?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.400
''Congratulations.''

08:13.700 --> 08:14.900
lt says congratulations.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.500
That's fantastic.
What did l tell you, huh?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.900
You see, you're a Yalie now.
One of the cultural elite.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.100
How does that feel?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.900
l can't wait, l gotta tell Meyers.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.200
- He's gotta pay up on his bet.
- Good.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.100
l'm gonna make him shave his beard.
See what he looks like in the nude.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.400
l gotta call Jay.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.299
He secretly didn't want me
to get into Yale,

08:33.600 --> 08:35.400
he wanted me to
go to Northwestern with him.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.600
Or end up in California University
with me.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.200
Yeah, well, that was
my safe school, is all.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.799
l can't believe this.
Do you realise this puts you in, like,

08:43.100 --> 08:45.700
the top one percent
of all intelligent life on the planet?

08:46.100 --> 08:48.300
This is outstanding.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
So, what's the Jay-man say?

08:55.700 --> 08:57.200
Andrea?

09:03.700 --> 09:05.300
Talk about having no class.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.700
What kind of guy breaks up with
his girlfriend by sending her a letter?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.500
A coward.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.500
You know, l never liked Jay.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.100
You didn't like Jay
because he's a Young Republican.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.400
That had nothing to do with it.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.700
Well, maybe it had
a little to do with it.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.000
But, you know, l always just knew
that he was wrong for Andrea.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.500
Of course, l never said anything,

09:28.800 --> 09:31.000
because l didn't wanna seem
like l was being--

09:31.300 --> 09:32.700
- Jealous?
- Bitter?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.200
Petty?

09:34.500 --> 09:37.900
Thank you, family, for my warm
holiday character profile.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.000
You won't mind
if l chop down your tree.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.800
Come on, Brandon,
we were just teasing you.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.800
We know that you and Andrea
have always had a special relationship.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.700
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.100
Nikki and l have
an even more special relationship.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.700
Yeah, we've noticed.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.100
<i>You mean,</i> B <i>randon and</i> B <i>renda</i>
<i>are brother and sister?</i>

09:58.300 --> 10:00.000
- <i>They're twins,</i>
- <i>Why didn't you say so?</i>

10:00.300 --> 10:02.600
B <i>ecause you kept telling me</i>
<i>to shut up,</i>

10:02.900 --> 10:05.500
<i>Well, in a nice way, of course,</i>

10:09.700 --> 10:10.700
Hi.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.800
Can't beat Christmas
at the Walsh house.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.400
Come in.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.800
Wow, what a pretty tree.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.300
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.100
- Let's study.
- No, l wanna trim the tree.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.100
Oh, come on, Bren,
anything beats studying.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.100
Come on in.
This one's broken, skip it.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.100
Yo. Did you guys hear
that Andrea got into Yale?

10:27.300 --> 10:29.400
<i>Don't you just love the Walshes?</i>

10:29.700 --> 10:32.200
- <i>Nice family, Good values,</i>
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>

10:32.500 --> 10:33.800
<i>Tell me about the blond,</i>

10:34.100 --> 10:36.800
<i>Does she have something going</i>
<i>with the guy with the sideburns?</i>

10:37.100 --> 10:41.500
<i>Well, not exactly, lt's more</i>
<i>of a three-way, triangular sort of thing,</i>

10:41.900 --> 10:43.800
<i>So how come you didn't tell me</i>
<i>about them earlier?</i>

10:44.000 --> 10:46.100
B <i>ecause l started</i>
<i>with</i> B <i>randon and Andrea,</i>

10:46.400 --> 10:47.900
<i>Now, can l go on, please?</i>

10:48.100 --> 10:49.900
<i>You're coming back to this</i>
<i>triangle thing, right?</i>

10:50.200 --> 10:51.400
<i>Yes, Clarence,</i>

10:51.700 --> 10:55.400
B <i>ut first we have to go back</i>
<i>to the teacher who lost his bet,</i>

11:02.900 --> 11:07.900
West Beverly offers many exciting
elective courses, such as Shaving 1 03,

11:08.300 --> 11:09.800
for the hygienically inclined.

11:10.100 --> 11:14.100
Okay, l pay my debts,
but this is ridiculous.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.200
Okay, l changed my mind,
you don't have to shave it off.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.800
- Now you tell me.
- No, actually it's a good look for you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.700
lt goes perfectly
with your split personality.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.200
- Funny.
- Now, is this the kind of nutty banter

11:24.500 --> 11:25.600
that goes on at Yale?

11:25.900 --> 11:28.400
No, all the real funny stuff
is done in Latin.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.300
You better start boning up, Andrea.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
lf you don't mind,
l'll finish shaving in the bathroom.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
See you, Gil.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.700
- Take care, Gil.
- Thanks, Andrea.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.400
David, what's wrong?
You're so quiet.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.500
l don't know.
l just sort of feel out of it.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.400
Why?

11:45.700 --> 11:46.700
Well, Andrea's the first.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.500
But everyone will be getting
into their colleges

11:49.800 --> 11:52.400
and l'll be left here by myself
in high school.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.000
Jay's got pretty good timing, huh?

12:09.700 --> 12:13.400
l used to think getting into Yale
was my heart's desire.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
Oh, well.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.700
So you wanna go
to the movies tonight?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.600
l can't, Nikki's due in from
San Francisco in a couple of hours.

12:26.900 --> 12:30.000
And you two wanna be alone?

12:30.400 --> 12:33.400
Well, we've got a little
catching up to do.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.800
Oh, hey, don't worry. No one's
coming in. l've got them well trained.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
Brandon, have you--?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.200
- l'm sorry.
- Mom.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.400
- l'm really sorry.
- No, it's okay. No problem.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.200
Thanks, Mom.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.100
Sorry about that.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.400
- Brandon--
- You know,

13:18.700 --> 13:20.400
l really missed you.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.400
l missed you too.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.300
Thanks.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.600
You know, you didn't call me back
last weekend. l was a little worried.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.000
Well, l wanted to talk
to you in person.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.200
lt was really intense up there.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.500
You said you were
getting along with your parents.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.600
l did.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.900
That's the problem.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.800
What do you mean?

13:43.100 --> 13:46.400
Well, with Diesel out of the picture,
it was like old times.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.100
We were really a family again.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
So...?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.800
So,

13:55.400 --> 13:56.900
l'm moving back home, Brandon.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.000
Really.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.500
- When?
- Tomorrow.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.100
They want me home for the holidays

14:10.300 --> 14:13.500
and l've got a lot of school stuff
to straighten out up there.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.700
l had to come back and get my stuff

14:17.400 --> 14:19.300
and see you again.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.800
And say thank you.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.000
And wish you a merry Christmas.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.500
- <i>l didn't see that coming,</i>
- <i>You ain't seen nothing yet,</i>

14:35.200 --> 14:36.300
<i>Well, he'll be okay,</i>

14:36.500 --> 14:39.300
<i>There's a lot of fish in the sea,</i>
<i>he'll have plenty of girlfriends,</i>

14:39.600 --> 14:42.500
<i>Not if he gets on that bus,</i>

14:56.600 --> 14:58.800
Brandon, do you have any pull
with the yearbook editor?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.100
Because l have two nominations
for ''Most Conniving.''

15:01.300 --> 15:02.600
Kelly Taylor and Dylan McKay.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.600
l'm really not in the mood
for this right now.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.700
Or what about for the category of
''Most Deceitful'' or ''Most Disloyal''?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.400
Let me guess.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.300
Are you feeling the sting
of rejection?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.000
Brandon, don't make fun of me.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.200
l know it's been a while,
but l'm sure you know how it feels.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Oh, yeah.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.400
lt's been a while,

15:21.700 --> 15:24.800
like about 90 minutes.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.700
- What?
- lt seems Nikki just broke up with me.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.500
Brandon, l'm sorry.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.800
lt's better for her.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.800
She's moving back up north
with her parents.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.400
Long-distance relationships
never work out anyway.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.200
So you just broke up?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.800
Bran, San Francisco's
not that far away.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, she thought it would be best.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.400
So,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.400
what did Dylan and Kelly
do this time?

15:53.700 --> 15:56.400
l thought you guys were like
the Three Musketeers these days.

15:56.700 --> 15:57.700
<i>So did l,</i>

15:58.400 --> 16:00.800
<i>They were all getting along so well,</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:04.200
<i>She is talking about that pretty</i>
<i>blond and the other guy, right?</i>

16:04.500 --> 16:05.900
<i>lt's Kelly and Dylan,</i>

16:06.200 --> 16:08.700
<i>You could at least have their names</i>
<i>straight by now,</i>

16:08.900 --> 16:11.200
<i>And you could remember</i>
<i>who you're talking to</i>

16:11.500 --> 16:14.300
<i>or you might end up doing</i>
<i>this presentation in a black hole,</i>

16:14.600 --> 16:17.000
<i>l'm sorry, There's just a lot</i>
<i>at stake here</i>

16:17.300 --> 16:19.700
<i>and l've never done this before</i>
<i>and it's complicated,</i>

16:20.000 --> 16:23.300
<i>All right, slow down, you're doing fine,</i>
<i>just back up a little bit,</i>

16:23.600 --> 16:25.500
<i>Okay, this was a few nights ago,</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:27.800
<i>They got together</i>
<i>to talk things over,</i>

16:28.000 --> 16:30.300
l'm sure you're wondering why
we both wanted to meet with you.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.300
l thought you wanted
to buy me some pie.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.800
Yeah, humble pie.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.400
- My favourite kind.
- Seriously.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.000
l don't know about you,

16:39.200 --> 16:41.300
but for me, these past few weeks
have been a nightmare.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.900
l mean, we are at each other's
throats, we're arguing all the time,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.400
- we can't trust one another.
- lt hasn't been a picnic.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.500
And that's why
l've gotta make a change.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.500
Dylan, we both love you.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.700
We both find you very attractive.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.500
And very sexy.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.400
And appealing.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.200
What exactly are you two
suggesting here?

17:02.500 --> 17:04.400
<i>This kid has seen</i>
<i>too many French movies,</i>

17:04.700 --> 17:07.000
<i>Maybe you've seen</i>
<i>too many French movies,</i>

17:07.300 --> 17:11.000
l think we should all stop trying
to hide our mutual feelings.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.000
Admit how we all feel
and agree to be friends.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.099
- Good friends.
- Platonic friends.

17:16.700 --> 17:17.700
l see.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.599
Dylan, you don't wanna be tied down
right now, you've said so yourself.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.300
And we could all use
a cooling-off period.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.900
- That way none of us will get hurt.
- And we're all in the same boat.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.600
So, what do you think?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.500
l think l love you both.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.400
And l wanna keep it that way.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700
- Good.
- That was easy.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.800
To friendship.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.300
<i>Wasn't that lovely?</i>

17:43.700 --> 17:46.000
<i>Should have known we'd end up</i>
<i>with a Disney picture,</i>

17:46.900 --> 17:48.900
<i>To continue,</i>

17:51.700 --> 17:54.200
<i>Their arrangement</i>
<i>worked wonderfully at first,</i>

17:54.500 --> 17:58.400
<i>They really gave it the old college</i>--
<i>High school try,</i>

17:58.700 --> 18:01.300
<i>And they all enjoyed</i>
<i>spending time together</i>

18:01.600 --> 18:05.700
<i>until that fateful night when Dylan</i>
<i>and Kelly came over to trim the tree,</i>

18:06.000 --> 18:08.600
Am l the only one who thinks
Shakespeare is boring?

18:08.900 --> 18:10.200
Yes.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.200
- Well, the language is so dated.
- How can you say that?

18:13.600 --> 18:15.900
l mean, okay, let's say you're
at your local mall,

18:16.200 --> 18:18.100
somebody's hassling you,
you say to them:

18:18.700 --> 18:23.800
A pox o' your throat, you bawling,
blasphemous, incharitable dog!

18:25.000 --> 18:26.800
- Yes.
- Thank you, William Shakespeare.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.100
- Does anybody else want a soda?
- Oh, l do.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.100
Yes wench, bring it forth.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.800
Coming right up, my lord.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.700
<i>lf it would be possible</i>
<i>for you to give me 2 4 hours,</i>

18:39.000 --> 18:40.900
- <i>to think it over,</i>
- <i>Sure, Sure, sure,</i>

18:41.200 --> 18:43.600
<i>You go on home</i>
<i>and talk about it to your wife,</i>

18:43.900 --> 18:45.600
- <i>l'd like to,</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i>

18:45.900 --> 18:48.200
<i>lt's A Wonderful Life,</i>
l love this movie.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.100
How can you not?
lt's an American classic.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.700
lt's A Wonderful Life?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.300
- <i>Never heard of it,</i>
- <i>Me either,</i>

18:53.600 --> 18:55.900
<i>l don't need 2 4 hours,</i>
<i>l don't have to talk to anybody,</i>

18:56.200 --> 18:59.100
<i>l know right now</i>
<i>and the answers no, No,</i>

19:00.000 --> 19:02.900
Cary Grant is so amazing in this.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.100
Yes, only it's Jimmy Stewart.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.800
<i>ln the whole vast configuration</i>
<i>of things l'd say</i>

19:10.000 --> 19:12.900
<i>you were nothing</i>
<i>but a scurvy little spider,</i>

19:14.900 --> 19:16.500
<i>And that goes for you too,</i>

19:32.200 --> 19:33.900
What's that for?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.700
lt's for nothing.
lt's just a friendly gesture.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.500
Friendly?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.300
<i>V</i> ery friendly.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.700
<i>l take it this is where</i>
<i>their arrangement begins to unravel?</i>

19:54.000 --> 19:56.200
<i>Not exactly,</i>

19:56.800 --> 19:59.700
- l'm sorry.
- Oh, l'm sorry. l started it.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.600
Yeah, well, you know it's just,
it's a habit.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.600
Yeah, a little backsliding's normal.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
lt just takes some getting used to.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.300
- Right.
- Because we are just friends, Dylan.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.700
- Right.
- Right.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
Yeah.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.800
<i>So the next day,</i>
<i>they all went to the Peach Pit,</i>

20:21.800 --> 20:24.600
Donna just couldn't believe we were
all being so mature about this thing.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.200
But l just told her, our friendship
is really important to us.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.000
Absolutely.
So finish telling me about David.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.700
His mom just decided to move
to Portland, Oregon.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.700
Why Portland?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.600
Because it's a thousand miles away
from his dad, l guess.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.800
l'm gonna go check on him.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.300
Look, Dylan, about last night.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.000
Bren, you don't have
to say anything.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.400
We probably should not
even mention it again.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.300
Good. Because it was
a one-time deal.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.100
Absolutely. l just wanna make sure
that you know that.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.400
- Well, accidents do happen.
- Right.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.600
Right.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.900
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.300
Hey, Dave, l'm sorry about
your mom, man.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.900
Oh, that's okay.
lt was just kind of sudden.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.500
l got to her house and all my stuff
was packed up in boxes.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.700
- That's rough.
- Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Listen, l don't know
if l'm gonna be up to videotaping

21:22.300 --> 21:23.700
the trip to Alvarado Street tomorrow.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.400
Don't worry, l'll help you.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.900
And you are going to make
a great St. Nick.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.900
- Brenda.
- Come on, Dylan.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.100
You can be a jolly fat man
for a couple of hours

21:32.400 --> 21:34.200
without destroying your image.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.900
Donna and l have to go back
to school

21:37.200 --> 21:39.000
to sign off on the final details
for tomorrow

21:39.300 --> 21:41.300
and we'd like to put you down
as Santa.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.500
Don't do it.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.900
We'll put you down as a maybe.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.400
Do you wanna come with us?

21:45.600 --> 21:47.900
No. l'm going home with Kelly.
l'll call you later.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.400
- And l'll call you later.
- Okay.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.200
Work on him, Kell.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.400
Oh, l plan on it.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.300
<i>So this is where their arrangement</i>
<i>hit the skids?</i>

21:59.500 --> 22:02.200
<i>Well, no, not exactly,</i>

22:06.200 --> 22:08.100
Dylan, why are you being
so stubborn?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.900
Oh, Kelly, listen,

22:11.200 --> 22:13.800
do you really think that any of those
little kids are gonna believe

22:14.000 --> 22:17.600
that a slim young guy like me
in a red suit is Santa Claus?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.500
Well, some of them will.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.700
l mean, when l was 6,
l went to the mall to see Santa Claus

22:23.000 --> 22:25.700
and l was in heaven
and he was Chinese.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.700
l never believed in Santa Claus.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.400
Well,

22:30.600 --> 22:32.000
that explains everything.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.900
What can l say?

22:34.200 --> 22:38.000
Come on, l bet you'd look really hot
in a red suit.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.200
You're being very persistent.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.600
Well, l promised Brenda
l'd do whatever it takes.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.300
Whatever it takes?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.000
<i>Nothing might have come of it</i>

22:51.200 --> 22:53.400
<i>if</i> B <i>renda hadn't decided</i>
<i>to surprise Dylan</i>

22:53.700 --> 22:57.500
<i>by bringing the Santa costume over</i>
<i>to his house to try it on for size,</i>

22:57.800 --> 23:02.000
- <i>Surprise, Surprise,</i>
- <i>Exactly,</i>

23:08.400 --> 23:09.600
l know what you're gonna say.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.300
And you can bet it ain't
''Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas,'' Dylan.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.200
Bren, come on in here,
let's talk about it.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.400
So you can have a real
menage a trois? Dream on.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.600
- Brenda, let's talk about this, okay?
- There is nothing to talk about.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.300
One picture
is worth a thousand words.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
Don't go away mad.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.900
- Now why would l be mad?
- Bren, it just happened.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.500
Oh, like it just happened
with me yesterday?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.500
What?

23:29.800 --> 23:32.400
Hey, look, l mean, we're all human,
all of us, you said that.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.200
What just happened
with you yesterday?

23:37.900 --> 23:41.200
l don't know about you guys,
but it's really cold out here.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Give me that suit.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.600
Oh, no, you brought it over here,
l'm trying it on.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.100
Why? So you can sit us
on your lap

23:50.400 --> 23:52.700
and ask us what we want
in our stocking?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.700
When yesterday, did this just
happen? l'd really like to know.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.300
Look, would you just relax, the both of
you, okay? Because nothing happened.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.800
- Okay? Nothing happened.
- That did not look like nothing to me.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.200
You told me to convince him
to play Santa.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.700
Oh, Kelly,
not by any means necessary.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.900
lt was just a friendly little kiss,
at first.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.900
Yeah, l know that routine.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.300
He did the same thing to you?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.100
Whoa, hey, hold on a minute.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.700
Brenda, you started it,
don't try to deny it.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.600
Swell.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.900
Look, just take that thing off.
You look ridiculous.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.000
You know, what is ridiculous is us
trying to fool ourselves into thinking

24:27.300 --> 24:29.500
- that we could ever be friends.
- You can say that again.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.500
Hey, hey, what do you want from
me? Look, you tell me you love me.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.700
You tell me that l'm attractive,
you hug me, you kiss me.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.300
What in heaven's name
do you expect?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.000
<i>Seems to be a question for you, sir,</i>

24:41.400 --> 24:43.100
<i>Don't look at me like that, Miriam,</i>

24:43.300 --> 24:45.700
<i>l can see this is heating up,</i>

24:47.600 --> 24:50.000
- Donna, l need to talk to you.
- What's up?

24:50.300 --> 24:52.300
Look, Dylan and Kelly
cannot go to the school with us.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Why not?

24:53.800 --> 24:55.900
Because we're not speaking
to each other, that's why not.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.900
- Again? What happened now?
- Nothing happened.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.900
All l know is l worked hard
on this project,

25:00.200 --> 25:02.000
l should have some say
as to who gets to go.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.900
You know that's not the way it works.
Besides, who's gonna be Santa?

25:05.100 --> 25:07.200
Fine. lf you think those two
are more valuable than me,

25:07.500 --> 25:10.200
- just cross my name off the list.
- Brenda.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.800
- Hey, Donna, listen--
- Dylan. How'd the Santa suit fit?

25:16.100 --> 25:18.300
That's just it, it didn't.
l looked like a stewed tomato.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.400
Oh, l am sure you looked fine.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.900
l don't think l'm going
on this little expedition of yours.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.600
Oh, Dylan, please don't say that.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.300
Hey, l'm sorry,
we go to a school one day,

25:26.600 --> 25:28.500
we play white knight to some
underprivileged kids,

25:28.800 --> 25:30.400
what kind of difference is that
gonna make?

25:30.700 --> 25:32.400
Well, l'm sorry you feel that way.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.200
Donna.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.200
Listen, Don, l'm not feeling
very good, okay?

25:38.600 --> 25:39.800
Kelly, you look fine.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.400
Put me on a bus
with Brenda and Dylan

25:41.700 --> 25:43.100
and watch me get sick
to my stomach.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.600
You don't have to worry
about that

25:44.800 --> 25:47.500
because Brenda already told me
she's not going because you are.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.800
She did? Well, you can just give her
a little message for me.

25:51.100 --> 25:54.300
Tell her that she can have the bus
to herself, because l won't be on it.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.400
- Kelly.
- Donna.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.300
David, l am so glad to see you.
You cannot believe what is going on.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.000
Everyone is backing out on me.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.400
l'm afraid l'll have to take
a pass also.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.600
David, look, l know you're upset
about your mom and l understand that.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
But you don't have to film it
if you don't want to.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.900
The most important thing
is you being there.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.200
But if l'm not gonna tape it, there's
really no reason for me to be there.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.000
David.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.800
l need you.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.900
Listen, Donna, this is a senior
class thing and l'm not a senior.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.300
Let's face it,
haven't l been tagging along

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
with you and your friends
long enough?

26:34.700 --> 26:36.900
Look, l'll see you later.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.000
And l hope everything goes okay.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.600
- Hey, Donna.
- Steve.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.500
Did you get permission
to come with us today?

26:47.800 --> 26:51.100
No way. They don't want a juvenile
delinquent serving as a role model.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.900
Well, what if you went in disguise?

26:53.100 --> 26:55.600
We could smuggle you on the bus
and they would never be the wiser.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.300
You mean, red suit, floppy hat,
white beard?

26:58.600 --> 27:01.300
Yeah, l would if l could,
but l'm sorry.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.800
- Yeah. l gotta go.
- See you.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.000
- Andrea. Hi.
- Hi, Donna.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.900
- Have you seen Brandon?
- No. Not recently.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.800
Oh, well, l was hoping you could
help me talk him into being Santa?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.900
l don't think l carry much weight
on that score.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.400
ln fact, l was gonna tell you l can't go.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.400
Come on, you are the last person
l would expect to flake out on me.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.700
Look, l'm not flaking out
on you, okay?

27:24.900 --> 27:26.700
lt's for charity, for heaven's sake.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.700
Look, l happen to do
a lot of work with volunteer causes.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.200
l see, so now that you got
into Yale you don't really care

27:32.500 --> 27:33.600
what goes on your record?

27:33.900 --> 27:35.300
That's a nice thing to say.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.400
You're right, l'm sorry.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.000
l am just getting desperate here.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.700
Can you please,
please help me out, Andrea?

27:44.500 --> 27:49.300
The truth is, l just think Brandon
and l need a little time apart, okay?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.300
- Brandon and you?
- Donna.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.000
You're gonna have to do this
without me.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.700
Sorry.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.200
ls someone trying to tell me
something here?

28:04.400 --> 28:05.900
Donna.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.600
Brandon, l cannot take
any more bad news

28:08.800 --> 28:11.200
so please don't tell me you're not
coming with us.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.900
Okay, so who do l tell?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.900
How can you do this to me?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.200
l know its last minute, l'm sorry--

28:17.500 --> 28:19.400
Brandon, please.
You're the only friend l have left.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.100
Donna, the last couple days
have been really tough for me, okay?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.800
And l'm really not in a festive holiday
sort of mood.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.000
l'd just be a downer.

28:26.200 --> 28:29.700
So fake it. lt will not kill you.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.300
Donna. Get ahold of yourself.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.200
Brandon, the bus is leaving
in half an hour.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.900
How come everyone thinks they
can drop out at the last minute?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.500
l can't speak for anybody else,

28:40.800 --> 28:43.600
but Gil Meyers is the faculty
sponsor. He let me off the hook.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.700
Well, Gil Meyers is not in charge
of this event.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.200
Oh, yeah? So who is?

28:47.900 --> 28:50.000
lf you had given us sufficient notice,

28:50.300 --> 28:52.400
perhaps your spaces on the bus
could have been filled

28:52.600 --> 28:54.500
from the long waiting list of students

28:54.800 --> 28:58.400
who would've been happy to join us
at the Alvarado Street School today.

28:58.600 --> 29:02.400
But at this point, unless you have
a note from your doctor saying

29:02.800 --> 29:06.100
that you have pneumonia--
And l wanna see that chest x-ray.

29:06.300 --> 29:10.500
--l expect to see each and every one
of your smiling faces on that bus.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.000
And l mean immediately.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.300
lf not sooner. Move.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.200
<i>So now that l've brought</i>
<i>you up to date</i>--

29:27.300 --> 29:29.200
- <i>Not,</i>
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

29:29.500 --> 29:32.600
<i>This</i> B <i>randon and Andrea situation,</i>
<i>l don't understand,</i>

29:33.000 --> 29:34.500
<i>Oh, l'm sorry,</i>

29:34.700 --> 29:37.700
<i>You see, you were so interested</i>
<i>in that Kelly-Dylan</i>-B <i>renda affair,</i>

29:38.000 --> 29:39.800
<i>l left out a whole section,</i>

29:40.000 --> 29:42.500
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>after Nikki dropped her bombshell,</i>

29:42.700 --> 29:45.400
B <i>randon went over</i>
<i>to the Peach Pit,</i>

29:47.400 --> 29:48.800
What is it with me, Nat?

29:49.100 --> 29:52.500
Every time l get involved
with a woman, it just falls apart.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.000
l must have bad relationship karma
or something.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.800
Oh, come on, Brandon, girls throw
themselves at you all the time.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.700
Another one will come along
soon enough.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.200
- Hi, Nat.
- Andrea.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.800
- How are you?
- Andrea.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.100
- l'll bag your order in a minute.
- Thanks.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.800
Brandon, where's Nikki?

30:10.100 --> 30:14.300
We had a little change in plans.
l'm on my own tonight.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.400
Hey, you still wanna
catch a flick tonight?

30:21.700 --> 30:23.100
l'd love to, l have to baby-sit.

30:23.900 --> 30:24.900
That's too bad.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.500
You can keep me company
if you want.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.200
Nice house, big-screen TV.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.300
Sure, what the hell.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.400
<i>Hey, watch your mouth, kid,</i>

30:33.700 --> 30:35.200
Heck, l mean, what the heck.

30:40.300 --> 30:43.300
Maxine's asleep. Right on schedule.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.600
<i>l'm serious! We must be good!</i>

30:47.200 --> 30:48.900
l love this movie.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.200
Yeah, me too.
l just saw it last night.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.600
- Well, we can watch something else.
- No. That's fine.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.600
l could watch this movie
a hundred times, it'd still get to me.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.600
<i>This is a present</i>
<i>from a very dear friend of mine,</i>

31:10.700 --> 31:14.800
<i>Look, Daddy, teacher says,</i>
<i>every time a bell rings</i>

31:15.200 --> 31:17.800
<i>an angel gets his wings,</i>

31:18.000 --> 31:19.700
<i>That's right,</i>

31:20.000 --> 31:21.800
<i>That's right,</i>

31:23.000 --> 31:25.200
<i>Attaboy, Clarence,</i>

31:33.000 --> 31:36.700
- l needed a good cry.
- Yeah, me too.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.000
You know,
that's what l love about you.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.600
You're just a sentimentalist at heart.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.100
And what else
do you love about me?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.800
You know, l don't know what
my life would've been like

31:48.200 --> 31:50.200
if you guys hadn't moved here.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.000
Well, you'd be editor of the paper
and you'd be going to Yale.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.500
Yes, but would l have been happy?

31:56.800 --> 32:02.000
Or would l have just been some social
outcast with calluses on the brain?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
That's entirely possible.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.700
You know, when l was dating Jay,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.200
l couldn't help but remember
that day last summer

32:12.500 --> 32:14.200
when l just started seeing him

32:14.400 --> 32:17.400
and you were trying to convince me
to stay at the Beach Club.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.300
- Yeah.
- You were expressing your feelings.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.300
Yes, and l can still recall the sting
of your response.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.700
Well, you know what they say,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.200
timing is everything.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.600
l can't believe you.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.900
- What? What'd l do?
- You were thinking of Nikki.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.500
- You don't think l knew that.
- You were thinking about Jay.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.900
- Oh, so now we're even?
- No, that doesn't make us even

32:57.200 --> 33:00.200
because l never even liked Jay.
ln fact, l'm not only insulted,

33:00.500 --> 33:01.800
l'm disgusted.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.300
- <i>Why did you stop it?</i>
- <i>Well, from there on it gets ugly,</i>

33:05.600 --> 33:07.600
<i>So now that you've gotten</i>
<i>all the background,</i>

33:07.900 --> 33:09.200
<i>Yeah, l see the dilemma,</i>

33:09.500 --> 33:11.400
<i>They got sidetracked</i>
<i>with their personal problems,</i>

33:11.700 --> 33:14.300
<i>No, excuse me,</i>
<i>but you don't know the real danger,</i>

33:14.600 --> 33:16.400
<i>Their bus is on a collision course</i>
<i>with a truck,</i>

33:16.700 --> 33:19.100
<i>l fixed that already,</i>
<i>l got that truck rerouted,</i>

33:19.400 --> 33:21.500
B <i>ut l didn't even tell you</i>
<i>about it yet,</i>

33:21.700 --> 33:24.300
<i>l took the liberty</i>
<i>of skipping ahead a few pages,</i>

33:24.700 --> 33:27.400
- B <i>ut how did you fix it?</i>
- <i>lt wasn't easy,</i>

33:27.600 --> 33:31.000
<i>lt's a complicated move and you can</i>
<i>only use it one time per catastrophe,</i>

33:31.300 --> 33:34.600
<i>Craig Clemons is on the 405</i>
<i>to Long</i> B <i>each as we speak,</i>

33:35.000 --> 33:37.900
<i>Craig Clemons?</i>
<i>Who cares about Craig Clemons?</i>

33:38.200 --> 33:40.800
<i>Greg Clemons is the guy</i>
<i>driving that other truck,</i>

33:41.100 --> 33:43.900
- <i>Which other truck?</i>
- <i>That other truck,</i>

33:46.100 --> 33:49.500
<i>Oh, so this guy,</i>
<i>Greg Clemons, is still</i>--

33:49.800 --> 33:52.100
<i>On the road to eternity,</i>

33:52.400 --> 33:54.800
<i>And so are those kids,</i>

34:11.300 --> 34:13.000
- Gil.
- Steve.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.800
Welcome to the Alvarado Street
Elementary School.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.199
What's the matter?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.199
Bus ain't good enough for you?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.300
Hey, Mrs. Teasley's not around,
is she?

34:21.500 --> 34:22.500
Oh, yeah.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.500
Aren't you violating some West
Beverly penal code by being here?

34:25.800 --> 34:28.900
Big time, but l was hoping the spirit
of charity would move Mrs. Teasley

34:29.100 --> 34:30.199
and she'd let me stay.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.600
What the heck, she can't give me any
more detention than she already has.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.500
- Are you from the high school?
- Are you?

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
Yeah, are you?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.900
l'm from the high school. They'll be
here in a while with lots of presents.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.699
Shouldn't they be here by now?

34:41.900 --> 34:43.699
l mean, l raced over from
my teachers' meeting.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.400
l guess. l don't know.
They must have left late.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.699
What's up, man?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.199
<i>Can't you make the truck stop</i>
<i>or turn left or something?</i>

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
<i>Hey, l'm good,</i>
<i>but l'm not a miracle worker,</i>

34:54.800 --> 34:57.000
<i>Well, then don't you think it's time</i>
<i>to call upstairs?</i>

34:57.200 --> 34:58.900
- <i>Absolutely not,</i>
- <i>Well, why?</i>

34:59.200 --> 35:01.600
<i>You don't want any of them to know</i>
<i>how badly you botched this up?</i>

35:01.900 --> 35:04.800
<i>Don't blame me,</i>
<i>lt's their own fault the bus left late,</i>

35:05.100 --> 35:07.500
<i>Oh, Clarence, Look at that guy,</i>

35:07.800 --> 35:09.200
<i>We have to do something,</i>

35:09.500 --> 35:12.100
<i>l'm sorry, Miriam, l know how badly</i>
<i>you want your wings,</i>

35:12.400 --> 35:15.100
<i>but l'm afraid we'll have to let</i>
<i>destiny run its course,</i>

35:20.600 --> 35:22.500
Are those people
ever gonna quit singing?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.800
l happen to like the singing.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.000
You would.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.100
Why are you always picking on her?

35:28.400 --> 35:29.800
Why don't you stay out of it?

35:30.100 --> 35:31.900
There's such a thing
as over rehearsing, Kelly.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.300
- Yes, and you are the music critic.
- He's allowed to have an opinion.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.400
lf he doesn't have one,
he can get one from you.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.500
Hey, relax, will you?

35:40.700 --> 35:42.400
Who died and left you boss?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.000
<i>While l sing of Yuletide treasure</i>

35:56.100 --> 35:57.800
So you guys mellowed out
back here?

35:58.100 --> 35:59.200
This is not gonna work out.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.400
Donna, we tried to warn you.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.700
Yeah, this group is not cut out
to be the ambassadors of good will.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.000
So the only thing you can agree on
is that you don't wanna be here?

36:09.200 --> 36:10.600
That's just great.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.200
So, what do you propose to do,
stay on the bus and sulk?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
None of us wanted to be
on this bus, remember?

36:15.800 --> 36:16.700
How could l forget?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.400
Look, we will pass out the presents.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.100
That doesn't mean
we have to enjoy it.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.300
Yeah and l'm not gonna wear
a red suit.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.300
You know what, you guys?
That is not good enough.

36:26.700 --> 36:30.600
lf there's one day out of the whole
year to stop thinking about ourselves,

36:30.800 --> 36:32.100
then this is it.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.900
And regardless of who gets
to wear the red suit,

36:36.200 --> 36:39.000
this is the time to be jolly
and loving and generous.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.500
Not cynical and moody and petty.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.500
And if you guys can't stop

36:43.700 --> 36:46.200
and appreciate all the positive things
you have in your life

36:46.400 --> 36:48.600
and just how lucky that you are
to be here,

36:48.900 --> 36:51.200
then you might as well get off
the bus right now.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.700
<i>Way to go, Donna,</i>

36:53.900 --> 36:59.500
<i>Not a bad idea there, kids, You</i>
<i>could get off the bus anytime now,</i>

37:28.500 --> 37:32.500
So how did Donna get so profound
all of a sudden? Anybody?

37:32.800 --> 37:35.400
Well, l think Christmas
brings out the best in her.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.500
And the worst in us.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.000
Not necessarily.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.600
You never

37:42.200 --> 37:44.200
really liked Jay, huh?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.700
No, l guess l was jealous.

37:46.900 --> 37:52.100
And l guess l was jealous
of Nikki, Brooke and Emily, right?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
Yeah, l got the picture.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.500
You know, we could put aside
our differences for one afternoon.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.400
Or maybe even
through the weekend.

38:07.700 --> 38:11.100
Or we could be really big about it
and go for New Year's.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.700
Donna,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.300
l brought my camera so if the
Madrigals want to sing another chorus,

38:19.600 --> 38:21.400
l can tape it.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.400
<i>She was too persuasive</i>
<i>for her own good,</i>

38:35.700 --> 38:37.800
<i>l can't bear to watch,</i>

38:38.100 --> 38:40.700
Here we go, Simon says,
put your hands on your elbow.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.300
Simon says, put your hands down.
Simon says, hop on one foot.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.800
Hop on the other foot.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.700
You all made it.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.400
- How we doing over here?
- l don't know.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.200
Simon says, stop jumping.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.000
Wait, l think l see them.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.700
Well, it's about time.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.300
Yeah, that's them.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.900
<i>Tis the season to be jolly</i>

39:19.500 --> 39:21.800
- <i>Oh, dear,</i>
- B <i>etter not look, Miriam,</i>

39:22.100 --> 39:25.500
<i>Just close your eyes</i>
<i>and it'll be over in a minute,</i>

39:36.300 --> 39:39.500
Hey, this truck's going the wrong way
on a one-way street.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.200
Hey. You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.100
Stop!

39:56.300 --> 40:01.000
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

40:01.300 --> 40:06.200
<i>five, four, three, two, one,</i>

40:13.200 --> 40:16.700
- <i>How did you do that?</i>
- <i>l didn't,</i>

40:17.000 --> 40:20.600
- <i>You mean it was</i>--
- <i>A higher power,</i>

40:42.700 --> 40:45.400
- Well, we sure are glad you made it.
- Yeah, we almost bailed, man.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.700
Somebody up there
must really like you.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.100
No, the one we ought to thank
is right over there.

40:55.100 --> 40:59.200
Whoa. Hey, slow down, man, you're
gonna hit your head on the jungle gym <i>,</i>

40:59.500 --> 41:03.000
You'll get a big hematoma,
l had one when l was your age.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.300
- Hi, Mrs. Teasley.
- Steven.

41:48.900 --> 41:49.900
This is Dylan's department.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.400
Here, now,

41:51.600 --> 41:55.400
it's very easy.
lt's all in the wrist, okay?

41:56.500 --> 41:59.300
Oh, my Lord. Good job.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.600
- She's like a pro.
- You probably knew that.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.800
You know, Donna,

42:12.500 --> 42:14.200
if l load up on required courses,

42:14.400 --> 42:16.500
like l'd planned on doing
last summer,

42:16.800 --> 42:19.100
l could finish early
and graduate with your class.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.800
That's great. But when will we ever
get to see each other?

42:25.900 --> 42:27.400
When we graduate.

43:07.700 --> 43:10.400
You girls never decorated
my cookies that good.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.700
Dylan, Kelly and l have been talking.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.700
Always a dangerous trend.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.500
You see, this Three Musketeers
thing was a bad idea.

43:19.700 --> 43:23.000
- So we've decided on a new plan.
- Wait, you've decided?

43:23.400 --> 43:26.300
Yep, you can't have your cookie
and eat it too.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.900
So you've got to decide

43:28.100 --> 43:30.100
which of us you wanna be with
on New Year's Eve.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.700
Or else.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.900
Now, if you'll excuse us, we have to go
tell Santa what we want for Christmas.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.700
Goodbye.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Did you hear that?

43:49.300 --> 43:50.900
You know, they say every time
a bell rings,

43:51.100 --> 43:53.000
it means an angel
is getting her wings.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.500
Oh, how cute.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.100
<i>Oh, Clarence,</i>
<i>are these wings for me?</i>

44:06.300 --> 44:07.900
<i>You did good, Miriam,</i>

44:08.200 --> 44:09.700
<i>Thank you, Clarence,</i>

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
<i>Don't thank me,</i>
<i>Thank you know who,</i>
