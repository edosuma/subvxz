WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.235
I CAN'T MAKE A WORD.
I HATE THIS.

00:04.235 --> 00:06.777
I LIKE GAMES
YOU CAN YELL STUFF.

00:06.777 --> 00:08.139
"JENGA!" "YAHTZEE!"

00:08.139 --> 00:10.141
"GO FISH, BITCH."

00:10.141 --> 00:12.183
WOULD IT HELP
IF WE HAD SEX?

00:12.183 --> 00:16.747
AND THAT'S WHEN TRAV REALIZED
HE WAS INVISIBLE.
(typing)

00:16.747 --> 00:19.120
NO, HE'S RIGHT. I CAN SOLVE
ANY PROBLEM DURING SEX.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.021
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE CONCEIVED

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
WHEN I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
THE VCR REMOTE.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.155
WANT TO GET SOME PIZZA?

00:24.155 --> 00:25.796
TRAV, YOU WANT TO COME?

00:25.796 --> 00:27.728
TOO MUCH SCHOOLWORK.
BRING ME SOME.

00:30.201 --> 00:33.033
WHEW.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.066
WHERE'S THE PIZZA?

00:35.066 --> 00:37.768
WE DIDN'T GO YET. BUT I
FIGURED OUT A WORD, THOUGH.

00:37.768 --> 00:41.072
OHH, THAT'S UNCOOL.

00:41.072 --> 00:43.074
OH, YOU'LL LIVE.
OKAY, I GOTTA GET GRAYSON.

00:43.074 --> 00:46.217
HE FELL ASLEEP ON THE HOOD
OF THE CAR. (laughs)

00:46.217 --> 00:49.220
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:49.220 --> 00:53.084
-- Captions by VITAC --

00:53.084 --> 00:55.786
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

00:55.786 --> 00:58.229
THE TREE ON THE SIDE
OF THE HOUSE IS DYING.

00:58.229 --> 01:00.161
SO SAD.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.792
STOP. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.194
WHEN WE MOVED IN,
I PUT A SWING IN IT.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.166
AND I USED TO HOLD TRAVIS
IN MY ARMS

01:05.166 --> 01:07.838
AND ROCK HIM
TILL HE FELL ASLEEP.

01:07.838 --> 01:10.801
DIDN'T YOU GUYS MOVE IN HERE
WHEN TRAVIS WAS, LIKE, 12?

01:10.801 --> 01:12.143
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

01:12.143 --> 01:13.844
I'M THE SURE THE JURY
WILL UNDERSTAND

01:13.844 --> 01:15.776
WHEN TRAVIS IS EXPLAINING
WHY HE BROKE INTO THE MORGUE

01:15.776 --> 01:17.808
TO SPOON YOUR CORPSE.

01:17.808 --> 01:20.151
(laughs) I GET HOW YOU COULD
BE ATTACHED TO A TREE.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.253
SEE THE TOASTER I GOT YOU
AS A WEDDING GIFT?

01:22.253 --> 01:23.784
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

01:23.784 --> 01:25.085
WE DIDN'T HAVE A TOASTER.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.817
WE DID HAVE A FLAMETHROWER

01:26.817 --> 01:29.089
THAT MY FOSTER DAD
GOT IN VIETNAM.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.221
I FIRED IT UP

01:30.221 --> 01:31.792
AND ACCIDENTALLY
BURNT DOWN THE TRAILER,

01:31.792 --> 01:33.764
AND I ENDED UP
IN THE STREET,

01:33.764 --> 01:36.267
BLAMING TOAST
FOR ALL OF MY PROBLEMS.

01:36.267 --> 01:39.830
YEARS LATER, I SEE
THAT TOASTER ON YOUR REGISTRY.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.802
YOU GET
A KICK-ASS WEDDING GIFT,

01:41.802 --> 01:44.175
AND I FINALLY MADE PEACE
WITH TOAST.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.106
I KNEW YOU WERE HERE
TELLING ME THE STORY,

01:46.106 --> 01:49.740
BUT I WAS STILL ROOTING FOR YOU
TO DIE IN THE TRAILER FIRE.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.111
SO MEAN.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.184
HONEY, YOU KNOW THE TREE
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE?

01:53.184 --> 01:54.815
WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPEND
SOME MONEY TO SAVE IT.
(coffee pouring)

01:54.815 --> 01:56.147
SOUNDS GOOD.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.788
ALSO, UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO THROW OUT

01:57.788 --> 01:59.850
ALL OF MY SEXY UNDERWEAR
THAT I NEVER WEAR,

01:59.850 --> 02:02.223
I'M GONNA NEED THE BOTTOM DRAWER
OF YOUR DRESSER

02:02.223 --> 02:04.195
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

02:04.195 --> 02:05.796
NOT A PROBLEM.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.828
OKAY. MM. (kisses)
THANKS, BABE.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.129
QUESTION.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.902
WHERE DID HIS BALLS GO?
(door opens)

02:11.902 --> 02:13.804
(door closes)
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

02:13.804 --> 02:14.905
OH!

02:14.905 --> 02:16.237
PHEW!

02:16.237 --> 02:17.838
BOOP.

02:23.774 --> 02:24.915
NOW THAT'S JUST WRONG.

02:26.877 --> 02:29.820
JER! HEY.

02:29.820 --> 02:32.152
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THAT 6 BUCKS THAT I OWE YA.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.884
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD,
I GIVE YOU A COUPON

02:33.884 --> 02:35.826
FOR ONE FREE PIGGYBACK RIDE
TO YOUR CAR?

02:35.826 --> 02:37.758
THAT'S HOW THEY GET AROUND
IN CHINA.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.889
FORGET IT. I MEAN,
LOANING BOBBY COBB MONEY

02:38.889 --> 02:40.791
IS LIKE PUTTING YOUR CHILD
UP FOR ADOPTION.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.233
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA SEE IT AGAIN,

02:42.233 --> 02:44.865
AND THAT'S OKAY.
(laughs)

02:44.865 --> 02:47.898
YEAH. SEE YA.

02:47.898 --> 02:49.169
JERRY ACTS LIKE
EVERYBODY KNOWS

02:49.169 --> 02:50.901
WHAT KIND OF MAN
BOBBY COBB IS,

02:50.901 --> 02:54.174
LIKE I'M A GOOD-FOR-NOTHIN',
A FREELOADER.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.247
TWO LARGE AMERICANOS
FOR RON.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.808
FREE COFFEE TIME.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.179
ALL RIGHT,
EVERY 20 MINUTES OR SO,

02:59.179 --> 03:00.881
THEY CALL SOMEONE
WHO'S IN THE CRAPPER.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.813
GET READY TO HAUL ASS.

03:02.813 --> 03:03.914
RON!

03:03.914 --> 03:05.216
I'M RON.

03:08.919 --> 03:10.791
RON MEXICO.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.224
WHOO!

03:13.224 --> 03:16.196
RON MEXICO--
BEST NAME EVER!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.898
LOOK WHAT I BOUGHT
FOR THE CUL-DE-SAC.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.830
IT'S A WINE SPIKE.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.233
YOU JUST STICK IT IN THE GROUND,
AND IT HOLDS YOUR BOTTLE.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.974
NOW WE NEVER HAVE TO HAVE
THOSE AWKWARD MOMENTS

03:23.974 --> 03:27.238
WHERE WE'RE OUTSIDE
BUT WE'RE NOT DRINKING WINE.

03:27.238 --> 03:28.939
YOU KNOW, I COULD KILL
A MAN WITH THESE THINGS.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.911
OOH! OOH! OOH!

03:30.911 --> 03:33.244
SO CAN WE TALK ABOUT
HOW YOUR DIME-EYED HUSBAND

03:33.244 --> 03:35.986
AGREES WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAY
WITHOUT A FIGHT?

03:35.986 --> 03:37.918
I KNOW. IT'S AWESOME.

03:37.918 --> 03:38.989
BUT YOU LOVE TO FIGHT.

03:38.989 --> 03:40.821
I DON'T LOVE TO FIGHT.
YOU DO.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.922
NO, I DON'T.
WE'RE FIGHTING NOW.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.894
I'M NOT ENJOYING IT.
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

03:43.894 --> 03:45.225
I'M PROUD OF MY TEETH.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.258
ENOUGH! LOOK, ANDY DOES
EVERYTHING I SAY,

03:47.258 --> 03:50.801
BUT EMASCULATING MEN
REALLY TURNS ME ON.

03:50.801 --> 03:51.962
BUT I KNOW YOU.

03:51.962 --> 03:53.804
YOU NEED TO GO TOE-TO-TOE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND

03:53.804 --> 03:54.965
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET BORED.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.867
YOU NEED SOME PUSHBACK.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.839
I WANT A PASSIONATE MARRIAGE.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.241
I WANT IT TO BE SPICY
BUT STILL AWESOME,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.844
LIKE IKE AND TINA
IN THAT MOVIE.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.816
YOU NEVER FINISHED
THAT DVD, DID YA?

04:05.816 --> 04:07.247
NO, I ONLY SAW
THE FIRST 20 MINUTES,

04:07.247 --> 04:08.919
BUT THEY SEEM LIKE
A GREAT COUPLE.

04:08.919 --> 04:11.021
OH, YEAH.

04:11.021 --> 04:13.824
LOOK AT YOU,
DRINKING LIKE A MAN.

04:13.824 --> 04:15.826
THAT MEANS
WE CAN TALK LIKE MEN.

04:15.826 --> 04:18.859
DON'T MAKE IT WEIRD, TOM.
AH.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.292
COUNTDOWN TO WEIRD
IN THREE, TWO...

04:21.292 --> 04:22.863
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
KIND OF TUSHY?

04:22.863 --> 04:23.934
(sighs)

04:23.934 --> 04:25.936
MINE'S A BIG OL' FAT ONE.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.267
GUYS...

04:27.267 --> 04:29.269
I'M WORRIED ABOUT WADE.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.901
THIS MORNING WHEN WE SKYPED,

04:30.901 --> 04:32.272
HE SAID HE WAS GOING ON
A SCOUTING MISSION.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.904
HE TRIED TO PLAY IT COOL,

04:33.904 --> 04:35.906
BUT I COULD TELL
HE WAS REALLY SCARED.

04:35.906 --> 04:38.008
YOU KNOW, THAT'S MY SUPERPOWER--
I PICK UP ON PEOPLE'S VIBES.

04:38.008 --> 04:40.050
AND IT'S, LIKE,
A HUNDO-TIMES STRONGER

04:40.050 --> 04:42.052
ON PEOPLE THAT I'VE STRUDELED.

04:42.052 --> 04:43.914
YOU THINK YOU HAVE
A SUPERPOWER?

04:43.914 --> 04:46.056
NOW I'M GETTING
A SKEPTICAL VIBE.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.888
VERY GOOD.
YEAH.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.990
EVERYONE IN OUR GANG
HAS A SPECIAL POWER.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.793
WE'RE LIKE THE AVENGERS.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.064
NICE NERD REFERENCE.

04:54.064 --> 04:56.997
TOGETHER WE COULD TAKE DOWN
THE CHITAURI ARMY.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.000
TOOK IT TOO FAR?
ANYWAY, NO ONE HAS SUPERPOWERS.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.802
SURE WE DO.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.973
I READ VIBES.

05:02.973 --> 05:05.906
YOUR MOM CAN SOLVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH SEX.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.038
YOUR DAD CAN GIVE ANYONE
THE PERFECT NICKNAME.

05:08.038 --> 05:09.880
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME
THIS MORNING?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.941
LAURIE POVICH.

05:10.941 --> 05:12.843
LAURIE POVICH!

05:12.843 --> 05:15.816
ELLIE CAN START A FIGHT
BETWEEN ANY TWO PEOPLE.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.789
OH, I BET
HE DOESN'T WANT KIDS.

05:18.789 --> 05:20.851
SURE HE DOES. DON'T YOU?

05:20.851 --> 05:21.952
WHAT?

05:21.952 --> 05:24.024
SO FUN!

05:24.024 --> 05:25.856
(Laurie)
ANDY CAN FIND ANYTHING.

05:25.856 --> 05:28.799
HEY, BUDDY.
FOUND YOUR LEGO PIECE.

05:28.799 --> 05:30.060
THANKS.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.003
STAN'S CRAZY STRONG.
HE MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO FLY.

05:33.003 --> 05:35.035
THE OTHER DAY, THEY FOUND HIM
ON TOP OF THE NEIGHBOR'S ROOF.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.869
AND GRAYSON
CAN IMPERSONATE ANYONE.

05:38.869 --> 05:42.072
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

05:42.072 --> 05:43.914
(imitates Travis) YEAH,

05:43.914 --> 05:45.015
I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

05:45.015 --> 05:46.917
HA HA!
NAILED IT, G-MAN.

05:46.917 --> 05:48.919
(imitates Bobby) HA HA!
NAILED IT, G-MAN.

05:48.919 --> 05:50.921
(laughs)
WELL, YOU CAN'T DO EVERYONE.

05:50.921 --> 05:52.082
(imitates Tom)
OH, YOU CAN'T DO EVERYONE.

05:52.082 --> 05:53.924
(laughs)

05:53.924 --> 05:55.886
HOW GREAT ARE WINE SPIKES?

05:55.886 --> 05:57.988
I KNOW. I PUT THEM ALL OVER.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.062
THEY'RE LIKE FIRE HYDRANTS,
BUT USEFUL.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.834
MM-HMM.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.995
I GOT A PLAN.
OKAY.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.997
(glass clatters)
GRAYSON WILL ENGAGE

06:06.997 --> 06:08.999
IF IT'S SOMETHING
HE CARES ABOUT,

06:08.999 --> 06:10.971
LIKE IF I WANT TO WASTE
A LOT OF MONEY.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.803
I GET MY PUSHBACK,

06:12.803 --> 06:15.005
THEN WE GO BACK TO BEING
IKE AND TINA.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.077
YOU REALLY NEED
TO FINISH THAT MOVIE.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.009
(motor starts)

06:19.009 --> 06:20.851
I SHOULD WARN ANDY
ABOUT THE WINE SPIKES

06:20.851 --> 06:22.012
BEFORE HE MOWS.

06:22.012 --> 06:23.884
YES.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.985
HEY, HONEY.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.857
HEY, BABE.

06:26.857 --> 06:28.018
OKAY, SO I HAD THE GUY
FROM THE TREE PLACE COME OUT,

06:28.018 --> 06:29.990
AND THIS IS WHAT
IT'S GONNA COST TO SAVE IT.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.091
(pours wine)

06:31.091 --> 06:32.823
(lawn mower motor whirring)

06:32.823 --> 06:34.064
WHATEVER YOU THINK'S BEST.

06:34.064 --> 06:36.096
(whirring continues)

06:36.096 --> 06:37.868
HOW'D IT GO?

06:37.868 --> 06:39.099
I'M STUCK
IN A PASSIONLESS MARRIAGE.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.031
(metal clanks)
(Andy) AAH! OW!

06:41.031 --> 06:43.003
COME ON!
(dog barking in distance)

06:43.003 --> 06:44.935
I DECIDED NOT TO WARN HIM.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.486
THIS SUCKS.

06:55.486 --> 06:58.188
I NEED GRAYSON TO CARE ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR LIFE.

06:58.188 --> 07:00.451
ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS TO GROW OLD WITH SOMEONE

07:00.451 --> 07:03.193
AND ARGUE WITH THEM
WHILE WE DRINK WINE.

07:03.193 --> 07:04.455
SOUNDS LIKE US.

07:04.455 --> 07:06.426
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PACK IT ALL IN

07:06.426 --> 07:08.499
AND BECOME BIG OL' DYKES?

07:08.499 --> 07:10.531
NO, NOT YET. BUT I LIKE TO KNOW
THAT CHOICE IS OUT THERE.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.604
STAY SKINNY JUST IN CASE.
DEAL.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.606
I NEED YOU TO USE YOUR POWER
TO GET GRAYSON INVOLVED.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.568
START A FIGHT BETWEEN US.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.439
MY POWER IS STRONG.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.642
IT'S LIKE A WILDFIRE.
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.474
I NEED THIS, ELLIE.

07:23.474 --> 07:26.146
HEY, LADIES. (chuckles)
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.618
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT
OF BACK WORK LATELY,

07:27.618 --> 07:31.582
SO I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
THE TRUTH'S NEW SIDEKICK...

07:31.582 --> 07:33.584
JUSTICE!

07:33.584 --> 07:35.455
THE TRUTH...

07:35.455 --> 07:38.158
AND JUSTICE!

07:38.158 --> 07:39.590
(chuckles) WHAT A TEAM.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.532
SO, DIME-EYES,

07:41.532 --> 07:43.163
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD...
(refrigerator opens)

07:43.163 --> 07:44.595
THAT JULES DIDN'T TAKE
YOUR LAST NAME

07:44.595 --> 07:46.597
WHEN YOU GUYS GOT MARRIED?

07:46.597 --> 07:49.500
I MEAN, COBB'S NOT EVEN
HER MAIDEN NAME. IT'S BOBBY'S.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.471
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FUN CONVERSATION. BYE.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.643
MM.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.244
SOME FIGHT.

07:54.244 --> 07:56.507
(door opens)
JUST YOU WAIT.

07:56.507 --> 07:59.650
(door closes)
HE'S GONNA THINK ABOUT IT,
DROP EVERYTHING, AND KABOOM.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.583
BY THE WAY,
YOUR ASS IS LOOKING TIGHT.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.615
CALM DOWN.
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.587
ALL RIGHT.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.619
NAME?

08:10.621 --> 08:12.192
I SAID "NAME."

08:12.192 --> 08:14.124
RON MEXICO.

08:14.124 --> 08:16.527
(laughs)

08:16.527 --> 08:20.200
I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH A GUY
NAMED RON MEXICO.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.173
HEY, YOU WANT TO COME
WATCH ME BUST UP A METH LAB?

08:23.173 --> 08:25.175
HELL, YEAH, RON DOES!

08:25.175 --> 08:27.277
WELL, LET'S DO IT.
(laughs)

08:27.277 --> 08:29.179
AND THEN HE TOOK ME
ON A RIDE-ALONG.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.181
(chuckles) I WAS LIKE
A KID IN A CANDY STORE.

08:31.181 --> 08:32.282
WHERE'D YOU GO?

08:32.282 --> 08:33.584
A CANDY STORE.

08:33.584 --> 08:35.546
THEY'RE OFTEN COVERS
FOR METH LABS.

08:35.546 --> 08:37.618
"RON MEXICO"
IS THE MANLIEST NAME EVER,

08:37.618 --> 08:41.151
LIKE JOE MONTANA
OR "WRATH OF KHAN."

08:41.151 --> 08:44.154
I WAS "RON MEXICO" ALL MORNING,
AND IT WAS AMAZING.

08:44.154 --> 08:45.556
GIRLS WERE GIVING ME
THEIR NUMBERS,

08:45.556 --> 08:47.598
I GOT A BUNCH OF NEW PEOPLE
WANTING GOLF LESSONS.

08:47.598 --> 08:50.230
HELL, I EVEN MADE
SOME NEW FRIENDS AT A.A.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.531
WAIT. YOU WENT TO A.A.?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.233
RON DID.
HE WENT IN FOR FREE COFFEE,

08:53.233 --> 08:55.265
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE'S TELLING HIS LIFE STORY.

08:55.265 --> 08:57.137
HEY, DID YOU KNOW
THAT OUR GANG

08:57.137 --> 08:58.538
SHARES A LOT
OF THE CHARACTERISTICS

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
WITH THE PEOPLE
OF THAT ORGANIZATION?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.212
NAH.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.144
CHOOSE BETWEEN BOOZE
AND YOUR MARRIAGE RIGHT NOW.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.246
THAT'S TOO EASY.

09:13.223 --> 09:14.324
(shatters)

09:16.226 --> 09:18.589
I DON'T WANT YOU TO USE
THE NAME "COBB" ANYMORE.

09:18.589 --> 09:21.261
KA-BOOM.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.634
UGH.
WADE HASN'T TEXTED ME BACK.

09:23.634 --> 09:27.297
IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS,
NOT KNOWING IF HE'S OKAY.

09:27.297 --> 09:29.299
THIS IS WORSE
THAN THAT ONE TIME

09:29.299 --> 09:31.271
I HAD TO WAIT AN EXTRA WEEK
TO GET MY S.T.D. RESULTS

09:31.271 --> 09:34.574
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO HAVE
SPECIALISTS WEIGH IN.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.208
COME ON, WADE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:38.208 --> 09:39.610
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:39.610 --> 09:41.351
PROVE YOUR SUPERPOWER THING
TO ME.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.153
YOU SEE THOSE GUYS
OVER THERE?

09:43.153 --> 09:44.615
WHAT KIND OF VIBE
YOU GETTING OFF THEM?

09:44.615 --> 09:47.187
OKAY.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.619
THE GUY ON THE LEFT

09:48.619 --> 09:51.161
ACTUALLY WANTS TO BANG
THE GUY ON THE RIGHT.

09:51.161 --> 09:52.592
WOW.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.364
THAT'S HOW ANDY
LOOKS AT MY DAD.

09:54.364 --> 09:56.166
(laughs) NO.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.198
GOD, I WISH I KNEW
WHAT MY SUPERPOWER WAS.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.599
WE COULD TOTALLY FIND IT.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.232
TRUST ME, TRAV.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.674
IT'S IN HERE.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.375
(whispers)
YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.637
(whispers)
BELIEVE IN WHAT?

10:06.637 --> 10:08.238
(normal voice)
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.310
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
A COOL THING TO SAY.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.242
YOU KNOW, JULES, TRADITIONALLY,
A WOMAN WOULD TAKE

10:12.242 --> 10:14.284
HER CURRENT HUSBAND'S
LAST NAME.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.186
WELL,
THAT'S A STUPID TRADITION.

10:16.186 --> 10:18.218
IT'S LIKE NOT WEARING WHITE
AFTER LABOR DAY

10:18.218 --> 10:19.650
OR CHASING PIGS INTO TOWN

10:19.650 --> 10:22.152
TO SEE IF IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG SUMMER.

10:22.152 --> 10:24.154
(high-pitched voice)
CRACKER ALERT.

10:24.154 --> 10:25.255
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE NAME "JULES ELLIS."

10:25.255 --> 10:27.297
IF A PIANO WAS FALLING
AND PEOPLE YELLED,

10:27.297 --> 10:29.229
"MOVE, MRS. ELLIS!"

10:29.229 --> 10:31.331
I WOULDN'T TURN BECAUSE
I'M NOT USED TO THAT NAME.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.633
YOUR NAME COULD KILL ME.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.205
(normal voice)
STRONG ARGUMENT!

10:35.205 --> 10:36.406
IF SHE WAS A ROADRUNNER.

10:36.406 --> 10:38.238
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULDN'T BE
A BIG DEAL, JULES,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.270
IF YOU WERE JUST KEEPING
YOUR MAIDEN NAME.

10:40.270 --> 10:41.641
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.
THEN HER NAME WOULD BE JULES--

10:41.641 --> 10:43.273
YOU KNOW THE RULE.

10:43.273 --> 10:45.645
YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD,
WE'RE NO LONGER FRIENDS.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.178
MAY I PLEASE SAY SOMETHING
THAT IT RHYMES WITH?

10:48.178 --> 10:49.249
NO.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.380
(whispers) FLENIS.

10:50.380 --> 10:53.183
LOOK, MY BUSINESS
IS JULES COBB REAL ESTATE.

10:53.183 --> 10:55.225
I CAN'T JUST CHANGE IT
ON A WHIM.

10:55.225 --> 10:57.187
A WHIM IS TRYING A NEW FLAVOR
OF ICE CREAM

10:57.187 --> 10:58.388
OR THAT THING YOU DID
WITH YOUR THUMB LAST NIGHT,

10:58.388 --> 11:00.330
WHICH BY THE WAY,
I DIDN'T LIKE.

11:00.330 --> 11:01.431
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:01.431 --> 11:04.394
YOU JUST LOST
YOUR NEW DRESSER DRAWER.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.666
DON'T YOU
WALK AWAY FROM ME.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.299
(door opens and closes)
THIS IS AWESOME.

11:09.299 --> 11:11.671
OKAY, HONEY, LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOUR SUPERPOWER IS.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.174
CAN YOU TOUCH YOUR TOES
TO YOUR FOREHEAD?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.345
I CANNOT.

11:15.345 --> 11:17.307
OH, THAT'S A "NO"
ON LIMBER MAN.

11:17.307 --> 11:19.349
(singsongy)
BUMMER FOR THE LADIES.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.451
(normal voice) CAN YOU
PERFECTLY FOLD A SHIRT?

11:21.451 --> 11:23.453
NOPE.
CAN YOU SPOT A VEGAN
AT THE MALL?

11:23.453 --> 11:25.285
(chuckles) NO.
IF YOU WERE LOST IN THE WOODS,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.686
COULD YOU TURN YOUR PEE
INTO DRINKING WATER?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.189
NO.
WILL YOU LOAN ME $100?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.390
WAIT. WHAT?
I WAS TRYING TO SEE

11:30.390 --> 11:32.192
IF YOUR SUPERPOWER
WAS UNCONDITIONAL GENEROSITY.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.293
IT IS NOT.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.395
LOOK, YOU HAVE A BABY FACE.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.227
DOES THAT DO ANYTHING?

11:37.227 --> 11:38.468
(sighs)
IT KEEPS THE GIRLS AWAY.

11:38.468 --> 11:40.370
WE WILL FIND
YOUR SUPERPOWER.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.272
AND B.T. DUBBS,

11:42.272 --> 11:45.305
HAVING A BABY FACE
IS AWESOME.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.377
DON'T LOOK A GIFT WHORE
IN THE MOUTH.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.309
PRETTY SURE
IT'S GIFT HORSE.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.182
NO, IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
THERE WAS THIS PROSTITUTE,

11:52.182 --> 11:55.215
AND SHE WOULD HAND OUT GIFTS
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.418
SHE DID NOT KEEP UP
WITH HER DENTAL CARE, SO...

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
OOH.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.295
WHAT'S WRONG?
DO YOU EVER GET THE FEELING

12:05.295 --> 12:07.397
THAT SOMETHING REALLY STUPID'S
GONNA HAPPEN?

12:07.397 --> 12:09.259
(whistles)
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

12:09.259 --> 12:11.431
I WILL NO LONGER ANSWER
TO THE NAME "BOBBY COBB."

12:11.431 --> 12:13.363
AND THERE IT IS.

12:13.363 --> 12:16.236
FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD,
I WILL BE KNOWN AS "RON MEXICO."

12:16.236 --> 12:19.209
AW, MAN. I WANNA PARTY
WITH RON MEXICO.

12:19.209 --> 12:21.171
I DO, TOO. LET'S DO THIS.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.273
YOU CAN'T JUST
CHANGE YOUR NAME.
SURE I CAN.

12:23.273 --> 12:25.345
EVERYONE'S COOL CALLING ME
"RON MEXICO" FROM NOW ON, RIGHT?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.277
I LOVE IT.
CHANGE APPROVED!

12:27.277 --> 12:28.348
OH, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE
"BOBBY COBB,"

12:28.348 --> 12:29.449
CAN I HAVE YOUR NAME?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.321
YES. NO, WAIT.

12:31.321 --> 12:34.224
RON MEXICO'S MORE OF
A "YEAH" MAN, SO YEAH.

12:34.224 --> 12:35.455
(laughs)

12:35.455 --> 12:37.427
BOBBY SAYS HE'S NOT GONNA BE
"BOBBY COBB" ANYMORE.

12:37.427 --> 12:40.190
WHO IS HE?
RON MEXICO.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.292
HOLY CRAP.
THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.294
COBB'S MINE NOW,
BAGGAGE-FREE. (laughs)

12:44.294 --> 12:46.196
PROBLEM SOLVED.

12:46.196 --> 12:47.467
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU SELFISHLY GET

12:47.467 --> 12:49.369
WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.202
ELLIE,
THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.343
(door opens)
TURN IT OFF.

12:53.343 --> 12:55.205
CAN'T DO IT.

12:55.205 --> 12:56.406
GRAYSON.

12:56.406 --> 12:58.348
NO, NO, LOOK, YOU DON'T LIKE
CHANGING YOUR NAME?

12:58.348 --> 13:02.212
I DON'T LIKE WEARING
MY WEDDING RING. YEAH.

13:02.212 --> 13:05.385
THERE. NOW NO ONE KNOWS
WE'RE MARRIED.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.187
FINE!

13:08.488 --> 13:10.390
DID YOU ACTUALLY THROW
YOUR RING?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.461
YOU DID.

13:11.461 --> 13:13.393
NO, I DIDN'T.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.425
WELL, WHO PRETEND THROWS THINGS
TO SHOW THEIR ANGER?

13:15.425 --> 13:18.228
LOTS OF PEOPLE.

13:18.228 --> 13:20.300
I'LL BE AT MY OLD HOUSE.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.501
(bottle clanks)

13:21.501 --> 13:24.274
(Tom) OH! SON OF A--MY FOOT!

13:24.274 --> 13:27.277
WHO PUT THIS HERE?! WHY WOULD
SOMEONE PUT THIS HERE?!

13:27.277 --> 13:30.240
NOT THE TIME, TOM.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.212
(thud)

13:37.217 --> 13:39.219
I'D HELP MRS. ELLIS
FIND HER RING.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.151
SHE'S NICE.

13:41.151 --> 13:44.054
BUT MRS. COBB
IS A GIANT CHORE.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.096
YEAH, WELL,
SOMETIMES MR. ELLIS CRIES

13:46.096 --> 13:48.028
WHEN HE MAKES LOVE.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.200
YEAH, ME, TOO.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.103
DITTO. YOU GOTTA
BE THERE EMOTIONALLY.

13:53.103 --> 13:56.166
HERE YOU GO, JULES.

13:56.166 --> 13:59.039
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT.
THANK YOU.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.140
MM.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.113
LOOK... ALL I WANTED

14:03.113 --> 14:05.115
WAS FOR YOU
TO GET INTO THE GAME.

14:05.115 --> 14:08.148
I WANT TO KNOW
YOUR OPINION ON THINGS.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.249
NO, YOU DON'T.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.021
YOU JUST WANT ME
TO ARGUE WITH YOU

14:11.021 --> 14:12.082
BUT STILL GET
YOUR OWN WAY.

14:12.082 --> 14:13.253
(scoffs)

14:13.253 --> 14:15.125
LOOK... (sighs)
MY EX, VIVIAN, AND I--

14:15.125 --> 14:17.057
WE USED TO FIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.129
NEITHER ONE OF US
WOULD EVER BACK DOWN.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.061
LOOK WHERE THAT GOT US.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.094
I... I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU AND ME.

14:25.195 --> 14:29.169
KEEP WHATEVER NAME
YOU WANT.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.174
BOBBY...

14:34.174 --> 14:36.276
WE NEED TO TALK.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.209
BOBBY.

14:41.051 --> 14:42.212
RON.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.283
YEP.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.185
"RON MEXICO"
IS A MAJESTIC NAME,

14:45.185 --> 14:49.059
BUT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH "BOBBY COBB"?

14:49.059 --> 14:50.220
(woman) RON!

14:50.220 --> 14:53.123
OH, CRAP!
THAT'S MY SPONSOR FROM A.A.

14:53.123 --> 14:55.265
RON, I'M JUST
CHECKING IN ON YOU.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.267
ARE YOU LIVING
ON THIS BOAT, RON?

14:57.267 --> 15:00.200
BECAUSE THAT IS...
THAT IS HEARTBREAKING.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.272
CHICK IS A BUZZ KILL.
(chuckles)

15:02.272 --> 15:05.305
HEY, SHUT IT,
YOU GREASY BOOZE BAG.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.108
LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME MONEY FOR A HOTEL.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.110
I'M GOOD.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.182
(bottle cap fizzes)
THOUGH I DID SPEND
THE LAST OF MY DOUGH

15:12.182 --> 15:15.015
ON THIS SIX-PACK.
(grunts)

15:15.015 --> 15:16.286
YOU'RE DRINKING?

15:16.286 --> 15:20.020
WELL, IT IS 4:00.

15:20.020 --> 15:25.095
OKAY, WHO WANTS TO HELP
FIGURE OUT TRAV'S SUPERPOWER?

15:25.095 --> 15:27.297
IS IT
THAT YOU CAN'T NOT HUG HIM?

15:27.297 --> 15:29.229
WELL...
OH, I HOPE NOT.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.032
(laughs)

15:32.032 --> 15:34.104
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

15:34.104 --> 15:36.066
WELL, I'M TRYING TO MAKE
A NEW LAST NAME

15:36.066 --> 15:38.038
OUT OF "ELLIS" AND "COBB."

15:38.038 --> 15:39.239
"CLOBEBLIS"?

15:39.239 --> 15:41.271
SOUNDS LIKE
HIGH-CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE.

15:41.271 --> 15:44.074
"HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
TRY CLOBEBLIS."

15:44.074 --> 15:45.145
(laughs)
(cell phone rings)

15:45.145 --> 15:47.347
OH, IT'S WADE. BABY?

15:47.347 --> 15:50.150
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
BECAUSE I LOVE MY LAST NAME,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.252
BUT I WANT
TO MAKE GRAYSON HAPPY.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.085
JUST HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

15:55.085 --> 15:57.027
HE SAID OUT LOUD
TO HIS MOTHER.

15:57.027 --> 15:59.059
I MEAN, IT'S HOW YOU CAN
SOLVE ANY PROBLEM, RIGHT?

15:59.059 --> 16:01.091
YOU'RE A GENIUS. (gasps)

16:01.091 --> 16:02.162
OH.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.064
THERE'S YOUR SUPERPOWER,
KIDDO.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.265
IT'S A BIRD. IT'S A PLANE.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.237
IT'S A KID
WHO GETS HIS MOM LAID.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.272
COME ON!
DON'T DUMP MINE OUT.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.304
I'M NOT THE ONE
WITH THE FAKE PROBLEM.

16:14.304 --> 16:19.049
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF PERSON RON MEXICO IS?

16:19.049 --> 16:20.210
NOT REALLY, NO.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.112
YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO HIM SPEAK.

16:22.112 --> 16:24.114
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE DEVIL JUICE
STOLE HIS SOUL,

16:24.114 --> 16:26.356
HE JOGGED ACROSS AMERICA?

16:26.356 --> 16:29.289
HE GOT SHOT IN THE BUTTOCKS
IN 'NAM.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.162
HE WORKED ON A SHRIMP BOAT.

16:32.162 --> 16:34.164
SO... HE'S FORREST GUMP.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.197
WELL, THERE ARE
SOME SIMILARITIES.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.030
AH, LISTEN, DUDE, IF I WAS
BOBBY COBB AT THAT MEETING,

16:40.030 --> 16:42.132
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULDA SAID?

16:42.132 --> 16:45.035
I PEAKED IN COLLEGE, I DRIVE
A GOLF CART INSTEAD OF A CAR,

16:45.035 --> 16:46.306
AND I LIVE
ON SOME OLD CRUSTY BOAT

16:46.306 --> 16:50.040
THAT'S SO FULL OF SPIDERS,
IT'S LIKE A SPIDER NURSERY.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.113
OH,
ALSO MY WIFE DIVORCED ME

16:53.113 --> 16:55.345
AND ENDED UP MARRYING
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

16:55.345 --> 16:58.088
YOU KNOW, AND SOMETIMES
LATE AT NIGHT,

16:58.088 --> 17:00.050
AFTER KILLING
THE LAST OF THE DAY'S SPIDERS,

17:00.050 --> 17:02.092
I LIE IN BED WONDERING
IF I'LL EVER BE MORE

17:02.092 --> 17:04.194
THAN WHAT I ALREADY AM.

17:04.194 --> 17:06.126
(sighs)

17:06.126 --> 17:08.128
SO YOU'RE NOT RON MEXICO?

17:08.128 --> 17:09.259
HELLO.

17:09.259 --> 17:11.131
I'M BOBBY COBB,

17:11.131 --> 17:14.334
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.168
(bottle caps fizz)

17:23.042 --> 17:24.174
(sighs)

17:24.174 --> 17:26.076
WADE'S OKAY.

17:26.076 --> 17:27.277
WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

17:27.277 --> 17:29.319
YOU KNOW, I WAS SO BUSY

17:29.319 --> 17:32.122
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
YOUR SUPERPOWER

17:32.122 --> 17:35.325
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT HIM.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.188
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE,
DIDN'T YOU?

17:38.188 --> 17:40.059
THAT'S CRAZY.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.261
THAT'S IT.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.194
THAT'S YOUR SUPERPOWER.
YOU'RE SELFLESS MAN.

17:44.194 --> 17:47.137
WHETHER IT'S SENDING YOUR MOM
OFF TO STRUDEL

17:47.137 --> 17:49.339
OR DISTRACTING ME...

17:49.339 --> 17:51.241
YOU ALWAYS PUT
EVERYONE ELSE'S HAPPINESS

17:51.241 --> 17:53.103
AHEAD OF YOUR OWN.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.274
SELFLESS MAN.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.346
IT'S NOT GONNA SELL
A LOT OF COMICS.

17:56.346 --> 17:58.308
I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET.

17:58.308 --> 18:00.079
(bottle clatters)

18:00.079 --> 18:02.112
I'M GETTING A WEIRD VIBE.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.853
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING
WITH YOUR TILES?

18:03.853 --> 18:05.185
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.187
LOOK, STOP USING YOUR POWERS
ON ME, WITCH.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.119
I WANT TO SEE.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.221

18:11.221 --> 18:12.362

18:12.362 --> 18:16.126
LOOK, I KNOW YOU CHALLENGED
YOUR EX-WIFE,

18:16.126 --> 18:18.097
AND YOU GUYS FELL APART.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.269
BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT.

18:19.269 --> 18:20.370
HOW?

18:20.370 --> 18:22.132
WE'RE BETTER.

18:22.132 --> 18:23.873
EVERYBODY OUT!

18:23.873 --> 18:25.205
THE BAR IS CLOSED.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.137
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T
JUST CLOSE MY BAR.

18:27.137 --> 18:28.278
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX.

18:28.278 --> 18:30.280
NO THUMBS.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.381
(rings)

18:31.381 --> 18:33.143
EVERYONE OUT! CLOSING EARLY!

18:33.143 --> 18:36.115
I GOT A FULL BEER.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.317
DID YOU JUST PRETEND THROW
YOUR WALLET?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.118
OH, YEAH.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.120
SON OF A BITCH.
THAT'S A REAL THING.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.352
в™Є THE WIND WILL COME в™Є

18:42.352 --> 18:44.154
в™Є THE WIND WILL COME в™Є

18:44.154 --> 18:45.255
AH!

18:45.255 --> 18:47.157

18:47.157 --> 18:49.128

18:49.128 --> 18:53.203
YOU KNOW, IT WAS NICE
BEING RON MEXICO.

18:53.203 --> 18:56.336
BUT IT'S LIKE WHAT JERRY SAID
AT COFFEE BUCKS...

18:56.336 --> 18:59.339
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE
GONNA GET WITH BOBBY COBB.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.311
JUST CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.373
PEOPLE ALWAYS MAKE THE MISTAKE
OF THINKING WHO THEY ARE NOW

19:03.373 --> 19:05.345
IS WHO THEY'LL BE FOREVER.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.277
LOOK AT J.K. ROWLING.

19:07.277 --> 19:08.878
SHE WAS POOR, STRUGGLING,

19:08.878 --> 19:10.250
THEN SHE CAME UP
WITH "HARRY POTTER,"

19:10.250 --> 19:12.222
AND SHE'S A BILLIONAIRE.

19:12.222 --> 19:15.285
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME WRITE
BOOKS ABOUT CHILD WIZARDS.

19:15.285 --> 19:17.257
I'M NOT GONNA BE
VERY GOOD AT IT.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.158
MY POINT IS,
YOU'RE BOBBY COBB.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.331
THAT DAY COULD BE TOMORROW.

19:21.331 --> 19:24.864
JUST ONE--ONE BIG IDEA,
ONE VICTORY IN YOUR LIFE,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.237
AND BOOM--
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.269
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.201
I KNOW IT WILL,
AND WHEN IT DOES,

19:31.201 --> 19:32.902
EVERYONE'S GONNA SAY...

19:32.902 --> 19:37.277
"GOD HELP ME, I WANNA PARTY
WITH BOBBY COBB."

19:37.277 --> 19:39.379
THANKS, ANDANGO.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.311
