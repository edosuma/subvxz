Ignatowski.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.467
Yo.

01:25.968 --> 01:27.434
Janine!

01:27.467 --> 01:28.901
I'm sorry, Mr. De Palma.

01:28.934 --> 01:30.300
I didn't do very well.

01:30.334 --> 01:32.300
No, no.
I just can't
seem to get

01:32.334 --> 01:33.634
the hang of this.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.100
Well, don't worry.

01:35.133 --> 01:36.801
You're just learning.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.267
What you need, Janine...

01:46.267 --> 01:48.567
is, um...

01:48.601 --> 01:51.000
for someone with
some experience

01:51.033 --> 01:54.000
to take you out for a little
on-the-job training.

01:54.033 --> 01:57.267
Louie's still coming on
to the new cab driver, huh?

01:57.300 --> 01:59.267
Yeah. I don't know
how any woman can
resist him, you know?

01:59.300 --> 02:00.968
Now, I got an idea.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.968
How about if I take you out
and show you the ropes?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.367
Oh, Mr. De Palma,

02:06.400 --> 02:08.667
you don't have
to do that.

02:08.701 --> 02:09.667
Now, Janine,

02:09.701 --> 02:11.167
I'd just feel terrible

02:11.200 --> 02:13.534
if you didn't work out
here as a cabby

02:13.567 --> 02:16.000
and you left
the Sunshine Cab Company

02:16.033 --> 02:17.534
without my trying to...

02:17.567 --> 02:18.534
Score.

02:18.567 --> 02:19.701
Score.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.100
Look, Janine,
don't... don't listen to them.

02:25.133 --> 02:28.834
That's just a little
of their crude garage humor.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.234
( <i>chuckling</i> )

02:32.267 --> 02:33.234
Yeah?
Jeff?

02:33.267 --> 02:35.734
Give me the keys
to Cab 881.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.234
Here.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.901
Come on, my little rookie.

02:39.934 --> 02:42.367
Hey, Louie, you ain't no driver.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.367
Banta, I was driving cabs

02:44.400 --> 02:46.634
when you were
in the third grade--

02:46.667 --> 02:48.801
your <i>first</i> year
in third grade.

02:50.767 --> 02:53.234
Hey, shouldn't
we do something
about this?

02:53.267 --> 02:55.067
No. Don't worry
about it.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.501
I taught her yesterday
how to handle him.

02:57.534 --> 02:59.000
What did you tell her?

02:59.033 --> 03:01.267
I told her, "If he
gives you any trouble

03:01.300 --> 03:03.200
just rap him on the snout
with a rolled-up newspaper."

03:03.234 --> 03:04.367
Hey, that's a good idea.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.300
You know what bugs me about
Louie is his attitude.

03:06.334 --> 03:07.367
The way he treats women

03:07.400 --> 03:09.868
I know.
like objects,
pieces of meat.

03:09.901 --> 03:11.367
I mean, doesn't he know
that thinking went out

03:11.400 --> 03:12.434
two to three months ago?

03:13.868 --> 03:15.834
Louie never taught me
how to drive.

03:15.868 --> 03:17.667
In fact, every time
I'd ask him a question,

03:17.701 --> 03:18.767
he tells me, "get lost."

03:18.801 --> 03:20.968
That's because you don't have
a great pair of legs.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.634
Yeah, but Louie
don't know that.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.067
You know...

03:28.100 --> 03:29.567
( <i>clears throat</i> )

03:29.601 --> 03:34.834
I have a tip that I think
might be helpful

03:34.868 --> 03:38.067
to young cab drivers.

03:38.100 --> 03:41.067
Have you ever noticed...

03:41.100 --> 03:45.501
that when you put the pencil
behind your ear

03:45.534 --> 03:51.000
it tends to slither out
when you go around sharp curves?

03:54.767 --> 03:58.267
Yeah. It happens to me
all the time, Jim.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.934
It's very annoying.

03:59.968 --> 04:01.701
What's your tip, Jim?

04:06.701 --> 04:08.701
 <i>Voila.</i>

04:10.167 --> 04:12.467
Oh, help! Help!
It was awful!

04:12.501 --> 04:14.200
I knew it,
I knew it.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.934
All right, what did he do?

04:15.968 --> 04:17.500
Quick, get some water!

04:17.534 --> 04:19.500
This lady's
not feeling well.

04:19.534 --> 04:22.000
All right, you're
going to be fine.

04:22.033 --> 04:23.067
Is she all right?

04:23.100 --> 04:24.601
We'll take care of
you. Don't worry.

04:24.634 --> 04:25.767
Jeff!
Yeah?

04:25.801 --> 04:27.033
Call a doctor.
It's all right.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.300
Please, don't
make a fuss.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.667
Hey, Louie, what happened, Lou?

04:29.701 --> 04:30.734
She hurt herself.

04:30.767 --> 04:31.934
All right, but
don't worry, ma'am,

04:31.968 --> 04:33.467
'cause you're in
good hands here.

04:33.501 --> 04:35.868
Lucky I was there
to take charge of things.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.133
Jeff, how you coming
with that doctor?

04:37.167 --> 04:37.701
It's ringing.

04:37.734 --> 04:38.968
How did she hurt herself?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.901
Oh, the poor woman,
she had a dizzy spell

04:40.934 --> 04:42.400
and fainted in the street.

04:42.434 --> 04:45.033
No, she didn't.
You ran over her.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.033
Well, what difference
does it make

04:47.067 --> 04:50.334
as long as she's okay
and nobody got pictures?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.167
( <i>horn beeping</i> )

05:04.400 --> 05:06.367
You know, funny thing
about this accident--

05:06.400 --> 05:08.367
it made Louie
a nicer person.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.367
I mean, he keeps calling
that old lady on the phone,

05:10.400 --> 05:12.367
sending her flowers,
going to see her.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.234
And he's been spending
a lot of time with her.

05:14.267 --> 05:15.734
Oh, poor thing.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.501
Hasn't she
suffered enough?

05:18.534 --> 05:19.501
I know what he's doing.

05:19.534 --> 05:21.067
He's trying to make
friends with her

05:21.100 --> 05:22.734
so she won't sue him
for his eyeballs.

05:22.767 --> 05:26.400
( <i>Louie humming</i>
 <i>"Pomp and Circumstance"</i> )

05:26.434 --> 05:29.100
( <i>laughing</i> )

05:29.133 --> 05:31.834
You all remember
Edith Tremayne.

05:31.868 --> 05:35.234
And, Edith, you must
remember the kids

05:35.267 --> 05:37.901
from the Sunshine
Cab Company,

05:37.934 --> 05:42.767
where "safety first"
is our only motto.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.434
I'm so pleased
to meet you all.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.734
Mr. De Palma
was kind enough

05:47.767 --> 05:50.234
to buy this
wheelchair for me.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.434
Well, well, well, Edith,

05:52.467 --> 05:55.100
you won't be needing
this wheelchair long.

05:55.133 --> 05:56.501
She'll be up
and doddering about

05:56.534 --> 05:57.734
any time now.

05:59.801 --> 06:02.834
And he sends me a dozen
roses every day.

06:02.868 --> 06:04.501
You're spoiling
me, Louis.

06:04.534 --> 06:06.868
You should be
spoiled, Edie.

06:06.901 --> 06:10.534
And now I'm going to show you
all around the garage,

06:10.567 --> 06:12.601
and we'll go nice and slow.

06:12.634 --> 06:15.067
We wouldn't want
to have any accidents.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.667
You know, something's
been bothering me

06:16.701 --> 06:18.868
ever since he
wheeled her in here.

06:18.901 --> 06:21.167
Her face is familiar.
It's very familiar to me,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.334
only I just can't
remember where from.

06:23.367 --> 06:27.367
And over here
we have the grease pit.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.133
Oh, that reminds me.

06:29.167 --> 06:32.634
I forgot to thank you
for the lunch today.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.634
Well, don't
mention it, Edith.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.067
Don't mention it.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.567
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:37.601 --> 06:39.567
Uh, have you and I ever met?

06:39.601 --> 06:41.267
No, I don't think so.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.434
You look very familiar to me.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.834
I probably remind you
of your grandmother.

06:46.868 --> 06:49.367
That's what
everyone tells me.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.634
Yeah. I guess that's what it is.

06:51.667 --> 06:55.467
Well, thanks for picking up
the conversation, Rieger.

06:55.501 --> 06:56.968
As I was saying

06:57.000 --> 06:59.968
all of our drivers
are chosen

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
for their intelligence,
their maturity...

07:04.033 --> 07:06.000
Uh, excuse me.

07:06.033 --> 07:08.434
( <i>clears throat</i> )

07:08.467 --> 07:12.300
Do you know how many jelly beans

07:12.334 --> 07:16.467
I can hold in my mouth
at one time?

07:16.501 --> 07:18.467
No, I don't.

07:18.501 --> 07:23.000
Well, I'll have to find out
somewhere else.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.734
And as you can see,

07:33.767 --> 07:37.300
we also hire those less
fortunate than ourselves.

07:37.334 --> 07:40.033
Now let me show you my cage.

07:40.067 --> 07:43.467
This is the nerve center
of the whole operation.

07:43.501 --> 07:45.567
Oh, that isn't necessary.

07:45.601 --> 07:48.100
Mr. De Palma,
it's wonderful.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.167
You have a lovely garage

07:50.200 --> 07:54.000
and you have a fine-looking
group of employees.

07:54.033 --> 07:58.267
And you, personally,
have been as good to me

07:58.300 --> 08:01.000
as if you were my own son.

08:01.033 --> 08:04.300
Well, Edith, in a way
you do remind me

08:04.334 --> 08:06.300
of my dear, sweet mother.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.000
God rest her soul.

08:08.033 --> 08:10.801
Oh? She passed away?

08:10.834 --> 08:12.801
No. This is her nap time.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.133
Oh.

08:14.167 --> 08:16.634
Well, your mother
must be very proud.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.300
You're a wonderful person.

08:18.334 --> 08:21.300
Well, I think you're
a wonderful person too.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.901
And I'm glad to be
a friend of yours.

08:23.934 --> 08:27.868
And I'm glad to be
a friend of <i>yours.</i>

08:27.901 --> 08:32.433
And I hope our relationship
isn't going to be hurt

08:32.467 --> 08:36.433
by this thing
with the courts.

08:36.467 --> 08:39.100
"Thing with the courts"?

08:39.133 --> 08:42.433
Yes. My lawyers
are forcing me

08:42.467 --> 08:46.567
into suing you
for a million dollars.

08:46.601 --> 08:48.234
( <i>growling and mumbling</i> )

08:48.267 --> 08:50.701
Thank you for showing me
the garage.

08:50.734 --> 08:51.701
Thank you.

08:51.734 --> 08:53.734
You didn't see this yet.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.100
What's going on?

09:09.133 --> 09:11.567
Louie went up to break
the news to Mr. Mackenzie.

09:11.601 --> 09:13.567
Yeah, and try to get
the cab company

09:13.601 --> 09:14.901
to pay legal expenses.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.601
Oh, boy, there's
going to be trouble.

09:16.634 --> 09:17.934
Thank you.

09:17.968 --> 09:20.434
I-I was sure
you'd see it that way.

09:20.467 --> 09:21.834
You're more than kind.

09:21.868 --> 09:23.200
Thank you, sir.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.634
ELAINE:
So, what did he say?

09:28.667 --> 09:30.334
The cab company's
going to pay for everything...

09:30.367 --> 09:31.734
ALEX:
Oh, boy, are you lucky.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.267
...and then they're taking it
out of my salary.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.701
Louie,
you have to pay
for everything?

09:39.734 --> 09:43.934
Everything, including the gas
I used when I ran her over.

09:43.968 --> 09:46.634
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.434
A million dollars.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.267
A million <i>dollars.</i>

09:50.300 --> 09:55.267
If the cab company was to take
$100 a week out of my salary

09:55.300 --> 09:57.267
a million bucks would take...

09:57.300 --> 09:59.267
two...

09:59.300 --> 10:03.000
200 years.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, well...

10:05.033 --> 10:08.334
that sounds a lot longer
than it really is.

10:12.434 --> 10:14.167
Ignatowski...
Huh?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.234
these matters
are too serious

10:15.267 --> 10:17.234
for you even to be here.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.267
Go sit in
the storeroom.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.734
Can do.

10:21.801 --> 10:23.968
I still wish I knew

10:24.000 --> 10:26.601
why that lady's face
looked so familiar.

10:26.634 --> 10:29.300
I can't believe her ingratitude.

10:29.334 --> 10:32.100
I mean, after all the things
I gave her--

10:32.133 --> 10:34.834
the wheelchair, the flowers,
the friendship...

10:34.868 --> 10:36.100
The tread marks.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.834
What I need here, is the best
legal talent money can buy.

10:39.868 --> 10:42.567
Jeff, give me the yellow pages.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.234
Here, boss.

10:44.267 --> 10:48.167
She's going to wish she never
heard the name Louie De Palma.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.100
I know that feeling.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.901
This is great.
That old lady has got you.

10:53.934 --> 10:55.868
Yeah, well, We'll see
about this, Wheeler.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.334
There you go.

11:00.367 --> 11:02.801
You can't do better
than this.

I'll eat a bug."

11:17.400 --> 11:21.033
Now, Louie, this is not
the time to economize, you know.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.033
I mean, you are in
serious trouble here.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.501
I think you're right.

has an attorney.

I'll see if
he can help you out.

with you, Rieger?

11:37.267 --> 11:40.734
I just remembered where I saw
that old lady's face.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.567
And it's funny?

11:42.601 --> 11:44.234
Yes, it's very funny.

11:44.267 --> 11:46.234
Do you remember
Sonny Bergmeyer?

11:46.267 --> 11:47.667
Sonny Bergmeyer?
Who's that?

11:47.701 --> 11:50.100
Sonny Bergmeyer, he used
to work here as a driver.

11:50.133 --> 11:51.834
Oh, a driver?

11:51.868 --> 11:53.567
Oh, mercy, a driver?

11:53.601 --> 11:56.100
Well, wait, let me
go check my scrapbook.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.934
Louie, Sonny Bergmeyer
ran over that same old lady

11:58.968 --> 12:00.734
a couple of years ago.

12:00.767 --> 12:01.734
Are you sure?

12:01.767 --> 12:04.234
I'm positive.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.901
She sued him too.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.501
But only Sonny checked her out

12:07.534 --> 12:08.968
and found out she'd been
run over by cab drivers

12:09.000 --> 12:10.767
once a month for years.

12:10.801 --> 12:12.801
Poor lady's
got rough luck.

12:17.334 --> 12:19.300
You mean to say

12:19.334 --> 12:21.634
that that sweet little old lady
fakes accidents?

12:21.667 --> 12:24.267
You got it. It's the oldest
trick in the book.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.734
She steps in the path
of a slow-moving cab,

12:26.767 --> 12:28.033
and just at the right moment,
she fakes being hurt.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.367
You're being sued
by a con woman, Louie.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.400
Aha!

12:31.434 --> 12:32.834
I knew it wasn't my fault.
!
That's right.

12:32.868 --> 12:34.300
Tell me, tell me more.
Tell me more, tell me more.

12:34.334 --> 12:37.267
What did Bergmeyer do
when she sued him?

12:37.300 --> 12:39.234
Well, he...

12:40.267 --> 12:43.434
No, I don't think you want
to hear anymore.

12:43.467 --> 12:45.567
Come on, Rieger!
No...

12:45.601 --> 12:47.133
You know how
my stories always bore you.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.467
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

12:48.501 --> 12:50.634
All right, all right.
All right, all right!

12:50.667 --> 12:52.667
What was it you
wanted to know again?

12:52.701 --> 12:54.334
Come on, Rieger.
!
All right,
all right.

12:54.367 --> 12:57.167
As far as I can recall, he
rounded up those cab drivers

12:57.200 --> 12:59.300
that she had done
that number on

12:59.334 --> 13:00.567
and he threatened
to bring them into court

13:00.601 --> 13:01.801
to testify against her.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.534
She dropped the suit
immediately.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.501
She was used to taking
the cab companies

13:05.534 --> 13:07.000
and having them
settle out of court.

13:07.033 --> 13:09.434
She didn't want
to go to trial.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.000
I'll bet she didn't.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.367
That's probably what
she wants me to do--

13:12.400 --> 13:13.467
settle out of court.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.667
That's right.

13:16.701 --> 13:20.634
( <i>laughs evilly</i> )

13:20.667 --> 13:22.267
Oh, I can't wait.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.701
I can't wait.

13:23.734 --> 13:25.000
What are you going to do?

13:25.033 --> 13:27.934
I'm going to make her
take me to court.

13:27.968 --> 13:31.634
And then, when I get her there,
I'm going to let her have it.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.667
( <i>growling</i> )

13:33.701 --> 13:35.667
Huh?

13:35.701 --> 13:37.667
I'm going to expose her.

13:37.701 --> 13:39.367
That's it.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.300
I'm going to make
her little gray head spin.

13:42.334 --> 13:45.634
I'm going to beat this rap
just like Sonny Bergmeyer.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.734
Where can I find this guy
Bergmeyer, Rieger?

13:47.767 --> 13:48.601
Bergmeyer? I don't know.

13:48.634 --> 13:50.067
He used to hang around
Benson's cafeteria.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.067
I don't think
he does anymore, though.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.734
Alex, you got
to find him for me.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.400
Why should I do that?

13:56.434 --> 13:58.667
Come on, you're the only guy
who remembers him.

13:58.701 --> 14:00.467
Come on, you know him.
You know him.

14:00.501 --> 14:02.400
Besides,
with a nose like that

14:02.434 --> 14:04.434
you're better
than a bloodhound.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.734
That's what you consider
sweet-talking, Louie?

14:08.767 --> 14:10.300
Come on, Rieger, you've
got to help me out.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.934
I could stand to lose
a million bucks here.

14:11.968 --> 14:13.868
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Listen...

14:13.901 --> 14:17.434
if you can save me that,
I'll give you $100.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.267
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.267
Save your money.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.767
I'll try to find
Sonny for you

14:27.801 --> 14:29.767
if you do
something for me.

14:29.801 --> 14:31.601
Anything.
Anything. Anything.

14:31.634 --> 14:32.601
All right,

14:32.634 --> 14:33.767
no more ridiculing
the cab drivers.

14:33.801 --> 14:34.834
Right.

14:34.868 --> 14:36.601
No more making passes
at Elaine.

14:36.634 --> 14:37.767
Good.

14:37.801 --> 14:39.334
And no more cheap
shots at Bobby.
Fine.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.067
And no more jokes
about my nose.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.734
Oh.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.234
Is it a deal?

14:46.267 --> 14:47.901
All right.

14:47.934 --> 14:49.601
It's a deal.
It's a deal

15:16.601 --> 15:19.901
Courtrooms give me the willies.

15:19.934 --> 15:22.567
I had to go to court myself once

15:22.601 --> 15:24.234
a few years back.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.434
Really? Did they get
you on drugs?

15:26.467 --> 15:30.033
No. I was already on drugs.

15:33.434 --> 15:36.667
That's why I was there.

15:45.634 --> 15:48.467
I just talked to Alex
on the phone.

15:48.501 --> 15:49.767
You're not going
to believe this.

15:49.801 --> 15:51.734
He finally found
Sonny Bergmeyer.

15:51.767 --> 15:52.834
Talk about
cutting it close;

15:52.868 --> 15:54.367
the day of the trial.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.100
You know, the trial's not
going to start for a while.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.667
Why don't we go and see
if we can pick up some chicks

15:57.701 --> 15:58.801
out in the hall, huh?

15:58.834 --> 16:01.334
Maybe we can get ourselves
a couple of legal secretaries.

16:01.367 --> 16:05.367
Yeah. They got to be
legal though, Bobby.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.267
Hey, Jim, you want
to come?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.300
No, I'm going to
stay here, look
around a little.

16:09.334 --> 16:10.367
All right.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.000
Thank you.

17:05.601 --> 17:07.567
I thought that
was you, Edith.

17:07.601 --> 17:09.567
Good to see you again.

17:09.601 --> 17:11.233
Oh, the cast.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.334
Nice touch.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.767
You're not going
to believe this, Tom.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.968
The cast is real.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.267
I actually broke my leg
this time.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.901
Come on, Edith,
save it for the judge.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.834
No, I'm telling you the truth.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.166
It's the damnedest thing,
I'm really hurt.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.501
When I bounced off that cab,
I broke my leg in two places.

17:30.534 --> 17:33.267
So you mean we've actually
got a legitimate case?

17:33.300 --> 17:37.000
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

17:37.033 --> 17:38.934
( <i>chuckles</i> )

17:47.701 --> 17:49.767
( <i>scoffs</i> )

17:49.801 --> 17:51.067
Hope you
didn't spend

17:51.100 --> 17:52.267
that million bucks
yet, Edith.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.267
( <i>growls</i> )

17:53.300 --> 17:56.601
ATTORNEY:
Mr. De Palma.

17:56.634 --> 17:57.934
Mr. De Palma,
please.

17:57.968 --> 18:00.868
When is your key witness
going to get here?

18:00.901 --> 18:02.200
Just relax.

18:02.234 --> 18:04.267
Don't worry.
He'll be here soon.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.300
Rieger's picking him up
right now.

18:06.334 --> 18:09.968
This is going to be the easiest
case you've ever had.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.334
Old Grandma Bunko's not going
to know what hit her.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.467
Boss...

18:15.501 --> 18:17.801
Ignatowski,
get the hell out of here.

18:17.834 --> 18:19.968
Boss, I think there's
something you ought to know.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.467
The only thing
I want to know

18:21.501 --> 18:23.567
is how fast you can
get out of my sight.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.734
Boss, this is really,
really important.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.067
You know how short
my memory is,

18:28.100 --> 18:30.734
so let me tell you
before I forget.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.767
Okay. What is it?

18:32.801 --> 18:35.467
What's what?

18:37.868 --> 18:40.901
Bean brain, get out of here.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.100
( <i>scoffs</i> )

18:47.534 --> 18:49.534
So, you had no idea,
Miss Tremayne,

18:49.567 --> 18:51.801
that the cab was
coming towards you?

18:51.834 --> 18:55.868
The only thing I noticed
was the sign saying "walk."

18:55.901 --> 18:58.868
I never even saw
the speeding cab

18:58.901 --> 19:02.868
when it tried to run the light
and came after me.

19:02.901 --> 19:05.534
Okay, now let me ask you this,
Miss Tremayne.

19:05.567 --> 19:08.868
Have you ever had
this kind of accident before?

19:08.901 --> 19:10.267
Objection.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.100
Will counsel for the defense
approach the bench, please?

19:17.267 --> 19:19.033
Rieger, where's Sonny?

19:19.067 --> 19:19.834
Let me tell you about that.

19:19.868 --> 19:20.901
He's here, right?

19:20.934 --> 19:22.701
He was all ready
to come in.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.033
Said he was
looking forward to it.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.701
Said he wanted to see
that old lady

19:27.734 --> 19:29.033
get what she deserves.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.434
Then he asked me whose butt
he was saving by coming in.

19:31.467 --> 19:32.434
Right, right.

19:32.467 --> 19:34.033
Then I did
a very stupid thing.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.033
I told him it was yours.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.367
Huh?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.133
He jumped out
of the cab.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.267
This is incredible.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.033
Didn't you tell him
if he doesn't come here

19:42.067 --> 19:43.934
that old bat's
going to take me

19:43.968 --> 19:45.300
for everything I got?

19:45.334 --> 19:46.634
I told him.

19:46.667 --> 19:47.901
Well, what'd he say?

19:47.934 --> 19:49.601
"The system works."

19:54.367 --> 19:56.334
Rieger, Rieger, I'm lost.

19:56.367 --> 19:57.834
I'm sorry, Lou.

19:57.868 --> 19:59.868
There's one bright spot.

19:59.901 --> 20:00.834
What's that?

20:00.868 --> 20:03.734
Our deal's off,
Aardvark nose.

20:07.601 --> 20:09.968
There's got to be some way to...

20:12.601 --> 20:14.234
Wait a minute.

20:15.234 --> 20:17.067
Wait a minute.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.434
Your Honor,

20:18.467 --> 20:21.367
may I ask the witness
a couple of questions?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.601
Well, that's within your rights

20:23.634 --> 20:25.901
as long as the opposing counsel

20:25.934 --> 20:27.567
for Miss Tremayne
doesn't object.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.901
Object to it?

20:28.934 --> 20:31.434
On the contrary, Your Honor,
we encourage it.

20:31.467 --> 20:34.434
Mr. De Palma, I don't think
you should do this.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.767
Leave me alone.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.501
I smell blood.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.601
Uh, Miss Tremayne,

20:44.634 --> 20:48.300
it is your contention

20:48.334 --> 20:52.701
that your alleged broken leg

20:52.734 --> 20:55.300
has left you
completely helpless.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.400
It certainly is.

20:57.434 --> 21:00.934
And you would have
the court believe

21:00.968 --> 21:05.767
that, uh... say in the case
of earthquake or fire,

21:05.801 --> 21:08.767
or some other calamity,
God forbid,

21:08.801 --> 21:12.267
you would be unable
to get out of that chair

21:12.300 --> 21:14.334
and save your life?

21:14.367 --> 21:15.133
That's right.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.601
You're saying

21:16.634 --> 21:19.601
that if this wheelchair,
for some reason,

21:19.634 --> 21:21.834
might go totally
out of control

21:21.868 --> 21:25.167
you would not be able
to get out of it?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.534
That's right.

21:26.567 --> 21:28.033
Well, I'm saying

21:28.067 --> 21:30.701
that you are not
injured in the least

21:30.734 --> 21:33.734
and I'm going to prove it
by doing this.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.501
( <i>screaming</i> )

21:39.901 --> 21:41.534
Don't worry.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.868
She'll get out.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.868
She'll get out of the chair.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.767
She'll get out

21:46.801 --> 21:49.801
before she hits the
stairs. Don't worry.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.167
Jump out, Edith.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.501
Jump out, Edith.

21:52.534 --> 21:55.000
Jump out, Edith!

didn't know...

floor are we on?

22:28.267 --> 22:30.300
The 16th.

22:30.334 --> 22:33.400
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

22:39.968 --> 22:40.934
Hi.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.267
Oh, how's Edith?

22:42.300 --> 22:44.033
Not too bad.

22:44.067 --> 22:46.367
Boy, scared the hell
out of her, though.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.968
But the chair and the cast
absorbed most of the damage.

22:49.000 --> 22:49.901
She's not really hurt.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.834
Mmm. They put Louie in jail.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.167
Yeah. That judge
was pretty mad.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.234
Yeah, I'll say. I never
seen a judge try

22:56.267 --> 22:57.834
to hit anybody
with his gavel before.

22:57.868 --> 23:00.734
So, uh, what's going
to happen now?

23:00.767 --> 23:02.467
Well, fortunately,
Sonny gave me

23:02.501 --> 23:04.868
some of the names
of the other guys she conned.

23:04.901 --> 23:07.968
Louie doesn't stand a chance
of getting out of jail

23:08.000 --> 23:09.634
until I round up these guys

23:09.667 --> 23:11.200
and get them to talk
to the judge.

23:11.234 --> 23:12.400
So, there's not
a moment to lose.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.601
The quicker I make these calls

23:13.634 --> 23:15.767
the quicker
Louie gets out of jail.

Night, Mr. Walters.
