WEBVTT

00:10.777 --> 00:14.953
They shut off communications with
us. They want to starve us out of here.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.494
Hatake and the CDC
have abandoned us.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.155
There is no treatment, no cure.

00:21.321 --> 00:24.200
We are forced to take matters
into our own hands.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
The CDC hasn't abandoned us.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.201
They'll be back as soon as
they figure out how to help us.

00:29.363 --> 00:33.402
They are not coming back,
they left us down here to die.

00:33.567 --> 00:37.538
Only we will not go down
without a fight. On this level,

00:37.704 --> 00:40.742
there is a control node
for the CO2 removal system.

00:41.341 --> 00:44.584
We can override it.
Can't they just filter in air from outside?

00:44.745 --> 00:48.090
It's 60 below out there and
everything past the main entrance

00:48.248 --> 00:51.525
is sealed up like a spaceship
to prevent contamination.

00:51.885 --> 00:56.391
But if we shut off
the oxygen scrubbers,

00:56.557 --> 00:59.731
they run out of air upstairs
in six hours max.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.431
So do we.
Level R is much larger.

01:03.597 --> 01:08.239
Fewer people, bigger air pocket.
Enough to outlast them if they want to,

01:08.402 --> 01:12.248
how do you say it, "play chicken"?
This is a terrible idea.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.750
We need to focus
on re-establishing communication.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.444
This is communication.

01:16.610 --> 01:20.183
The base is full of hazardous materials
and an even more hazardous infection.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.384
You're endangering
every single person...

01:22.549 --> 01:24.927
Thank you for your input,
Dr. Walker,

01:25.385 --> 01:28.696
but it's time, I think,
you found a new place to bunk.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.925
Do you even know if this was
an accident or was it intentional?

02:31.084 --> 02:34.190
I have my people
investigating <i>as</i> we speak.

02:34.354 --> 02:37.198
That's just great. And how
do we control this outbreak

02:37.357 --> 02:39.598
without communication
with the outside world?

02:39.760 --> 02:43.503
You have access to the top
minds and equipment in the world here.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.543
That sounds like you don't plan
to repair the satellite dish.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.680
It took a top-tier
military contractor

02:48.835 --> 02:51.543
two months in scaffolds
to put up that equipment.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.048
It doesn't just get fixed.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.277
How long before
somebody notices we're dark?

02:55.442 --> 02:59.857
We have periodic resupply drops.
Am I the only one here alarmed by this?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.789
We have people down on Level R,
including one of my own,

03:02.949 --> 03:05.054
locked up with
a week's worth of supplies.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.165
You're the one
who wanted to seal that floor.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.200
Temporarily. When I thought
we could call for reinforcements.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.304
If this is a long-term situation,

03:13.460 --> 03:16.304
we have to provide those people
with some standard of care.

03:16.463 --> 03:21.503
I barely had the manpower to stop one of
those vectors from infecting half the base.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.910
We can't risk
re-opening that floor.

03:24.071 --> 03:27.848
We are dealing with something
we've never seen before.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.416
So we just abandon
the sick and the dying?

03:37.417 --> 03:39.090
Yes.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.084
Shit.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.625
Dr. Jordan.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.240
Yes, um... Dr. Van Eigem.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.398
You tested me yesterday.
Can I come in?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.407
Um... Sure.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.947
How can I help you?
I don't wanna go to Level R.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.818
You won't, you tested negative.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.889
And you haven't gotten
any false results? Any variances?

04:39.045 --> 04:41.423
No, I designed the test myself.
Are you sure?

04:42.048 --> 04:44.654
Yes, of course.
I mean...

04:45.218 --> 04:47.255
are you really sure?

04:53.727 --> 04:56.970
Hatake's not budging. He intends
to leave the infected downstairs

04:57.130 --> 04:59.007
with whatever food
and supplies they can

04:59.166 --> 05:00.907
scrounge until
there's a treatment.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.307
Poor Julia.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.847
What happened
to calling in reinforcements?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.986
With the com-link down, we're
blacked out and dead to the world.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.485
He did say something
about periodic resupply drops.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.955
He say how periodic they are?
No. Man's playing his own game,

05:14.147 --> 05:17.458
and he isn't sharing the playbook.
You know that. We're on our own.

05:17.617 --> 05:21.759
All we have going for us is our
rapid response test to the virus.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.698
Sorry. I had to babysit
a PSR assay.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.337
Yeah, and the dog ate my homework.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.702
Hey, we're all feeling the pressure
but we need to stay on point here.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.707
A lot of people in for a lot
of suffering if we don't step it up.

05:33.867 --> 05:38.612
Doreen, your progress on the source?
Strong possibility of zoonotic transfer.

05:38.772 --> 05:43.551
Only question is, was it a monkey
to human or the other way around?

05:43.710 --> 05:45.815
I need more than that.
Okay.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.317
Sarah?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.983
I'm picking up Walker's
analysis of the Narvik samples.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.959
I have the DNA sequencers
going 24/7,

05:52.118 --> 05:55.395
and I'm running multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplifications

05:55.555 --> 05:58.468
for all known virulence factors.
Good.

05:58.625 --> 06:02.072
The sooner we have a viable treatment
option, the sooner we get Julia back.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.870
Just remember that.
I'm gonna check on my brother.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.884
The morphine isn't helping.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.147
I know the symptoms, Dr.
Duchamp, he's dying.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.320
We need to start
the SODRA immediately.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.984
The SODRA treatment has never been
tested on human beings, not once.

06:24.150 --> 06:28.690
That doesn't mean it won't work,
it's a universal antiviral.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.028
I wish we had time for testing,
but we don't.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.774
If it were your brother,
wouldn't you try everything you could?

06:37.931 --> 06:41.674
Killing a human being with an untested
treatment, it's unconscionable.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.611
It's up to next of kin
to give informed consent

06:48.775 --> 06:51.221
when the patient has left
no clear directives.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.416
Even in the case of a highly
experimental treatment.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.449
I consent.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.400
Major Balleseros.

07:09.562 --> 07:13.874
I heard about your
satellite dish, hell of a thing.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.911
Are you out of your mind?

07:18.738 --> 07:22.811
I like to think I'm bringing
a little sanity to the proceedings.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.150
Keeping the word from getting out
on this shit show is my imperative.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.657
I also have imperatives.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.762
I've been waiting to hear what
yours might be since I got here.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.559
Before the CDC or one of your scientists
shares it with the rest of the world.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.794
My work here is protected,
even from you.

07:38.959 --> 07:39.960
Not anymore.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.907
You made a virus that does everything
other than what you advertised.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.847
You don't have the intellectual
capacity to evaluate my work.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.080
You want things to get easier?

07:57.243 --> 07:59.689
Produce the results
you promised our employers.

07:59.846 --> 08:00.916
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

08:02.282 --> 08:04.694
What's going on?
Atmosphere sensor alert.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.155
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

08:09.422 --> 08:13.097
<i>CO2 levels are rising.
Environmental alert.</i>

08:13.259 --> 08:15.432
Someone's shut off
the oxygen scrubbers.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.801
Ooh. Is that bad?
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

08:17.964 --> 08:20.774
Only if you like breathing.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.447
The control node is 30 meters
from the old thermogenics lab.

08:31.611 --> 08:35.320
It was engineered with analog override
switches for the oxygen scrubbers.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.361
System malfunction?
They used a hardwired code.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.725
My guess is they wanna
force us down to Level R.

08:40.886 --> 08:44.232
It's a blackmail play,
to get us to negotiate.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.392
How much time?

08:45.558 --> 08:48.539
Six hours before
CO2 levels hit the redline.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.199
In two hours we can expect to start
suffering headaches, nausea, vomiting...

08:52.365 --> 08:56.905
All right. Let's get some weapons
and go negotiate.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.081
They'll have an ambush ready.
We'd be taken hostage.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.347
Speak for yourself.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.691
What do we do?

09:07.847 --> 09:09.554
We do nothing.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.753
I will handle this personally.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.330
Like you've handled everything else?

09:22.529 --> 09:27.035
I'll take a security team downstairs.
No security team, just you and me.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.535
You're going?

09:29.769 --> 09:32.215
It took many years
to build this base.

09:33.540 --> 09:38.285
I won't sit by while someone
tries to destroy it.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.414
Open up.

09:45.452 --> 09:49.525
Just get it over with, am I infected?
Headache is a very general symptom.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.633
It's not as if you're hallucinating
or experiencing labile emotions

09:53.793 --> 09:57.240
and uncontrollable anger.
Not yet.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.371
Test says you're clear.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.312
What about this?

10:07.474 --> 10:10.580
It's possible that it's a
psychosomatic response to stress.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.745
This is not in my head,
don't you get that?

10:13.646 --> 10:14.716
You need to calm down.

10:16.216 --> 10:20.062
That's easy for you to say. You're
not the one with a deadly disease.

10:22.422 --> 10:25.960
Don't let them send me
down there, please.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.933
If I go down there,
I'll never come back up.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.636
Hey, we're not just sending
people down there to die.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.007
I'm sorry.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.985
That's what you think.
You don't know Hatake.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.987
And you don't know
Dr. Farragut.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.251
He's not gonna let
anything happen to us.

10:52.785 --> 10:55.857
I hope I can trust you, Sarah.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.838
Breathe. Breathe, Peter.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.109
It's okay.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.720
Peter, it'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.030
Something wrong
with the dose regulator?

11:29.189 --> 11:32.398
Is there anything I can tell you
to make you stop?

11:34.727 --> 11:36.570
No.

11:51.477 --> 11:54.549
Breathe. Breathe.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.901
- We out of air yet?
- I'm still breathing.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.209
Did you get any results
from that sample I gave you?

12:11.364 --> 12:15.005
You want answers, I want
answers, see how that works?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.842
There's no reason I shouldn't
be telling Alan what's what.

12:18.004 --> 12:21.042
You want me to keep working
on your little pet project?

12:21.941 --> 12:24.444
Give me a reason.
Maybe you haven't noticed

12:24.611 --> 12:27.491
but there are people that don't want
what's inside this base getting out.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.889
I haven't had nearly enough
sleep, coffee, or cigarettes

12:32.051 --> 12:34.793
to deal with any more of this
Fox Mulder crap from you.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.894
Doreen.

12:38.791 --> 12:43.137
If you tell another living soul what I'm
about to say, I end up in a hurt locker.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.037
You mean as opposed
to this paradise?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.972
I'm with a special investigative
section in the Pentagon.

12:51.537 --> 12:55.075
I was sent as part of an internal inquiry
for a black-bag research operation.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.755
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.890
Don't make me regret this.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.783
Okay.

13:02.415 --> 13:07.797
So your superiors
think the virus is a weapon?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.433
Weapons get rid of the enemy,

13:09.589 --> 13:12.001
this thing seems to make them
even more dangerous.

13:12.158 --> 13:16.072
We have a hidden base conducting secret
research outside the reach of government.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.903
No one knows the bigger picture.
And you think you do?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.805
I heard these germ docs
over at Fort Detrick

13:21.968 --> 13:24.642
talking about using viruses
to move DNA around.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.114
Gene delivery vehicles?
Yeah, that was it.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.118
What if this virus
is acting like a freight train

13:30.276 --> 13:32.313
pulling some
weird-ass DNA behind it?

13:34.480 --> 13:38.326
Maybe you're not <i>as</i> dumb
as you look.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.362
I'll run the virus through
the gene sequencer.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.469
Try to remember
that we are running out of air.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.336
You can take the gas mask off,
the virus isn't airborne.

15:02.902 --> 15:09.285
Are you experiencing any symptoms?
Nausea, fever, black mucus discharge?

15:13.846 --> 15:17.055
I promise, I'm not like him.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.887
If I start going crazy,

15:20.052 --> 15:22.293
you have my permission to beat me
to death with that stick you stuck

15:22.555 --> 15:26.435
in the door. Right now,
I'd like to thank my rescuer.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.733
Please.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.945
I'm keeping my gloves on.
Fair enough.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.587
What's your name?
Jaye.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.960
Just Jaye?
I'm an MD, PhD, blah, blah, blah.

15:55.121 --> 15:58.125
Got an alphabet soup after my name
if that makes any difference.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.565
It doesn't.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.671
I'm Julia Walker.
I know who you are.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.903
You're that CDC chick.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.071
I kind of like the sound of that.

16:12.738 --> 16:17.619
I hate to be a crappy houseguest but you
got anything to eat or drink around here?

16:17.777 --> 16:22.920
Look around. You just got the grand tour.
You like it?

16:24.150 --> 16:27.097
All in all, I'd rather be in Montana.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.365
Hatake stashed MRE lockers
in strategic locations.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.836
You know, in case shit ever hit the fan.
Oh, I'd say this qualifies.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.975
Yeah. Yeah.

16:40.299 --> 16:44.270
Two hours, thirty-six minutes, the
first two infusions of the SODRA antiviral

16:44.437 --> 16:48.476
have been administered under
the modified Duchamp protocols.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.655
Patient marginally stabilizing.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.534
Is this how you wanna go out?

17:08.060 --> 17:13.339
The kid who had the balls to go through
Dad's pockets when he was passed out?

17:13.499 --> 17:17.413
The kid who talked me down
from a fifty-fifty to a 70-30 split

17:17.569 --> 17:20.642
and made it seem like
he was doing me a favor?

17:30.216 --> 17:35.325
I would not have survived
if you hadn't been there.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.200
What that man...

17:41.527 --> 17:43.939
What that man did to us.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.075
I owe you this.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.344
And you owe me...

17:56.742 --> 17:58.881
for that night.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.868
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

18:19.131 --> 18:20.542
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

18:25.705 --> 18:30.051
My head hurts. Do
you have anything stronger?

18:31.143 --> 18:34.784
I've given you the highest dosage
of NSAIDs I can.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.123
I'm not worried
about hurting my liver.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.126
Did you recheck
your rapid response tests?

18:44.256 --> 18:46.065
I did.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.901
There's nothing wrong with it.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.273
You said you'd step up
the care packages.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.138
It's not enough to Skype
with me a couple times a week.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.407
Excuse me?

18:58.604 --> 19:01.744
The silences, the pauses.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.581
Why don't you just tell me
her name and get it over with?

19:04.744 --> 19:07.657
There's tons of guys on this ice hole
who'd love to be with me.

19:07.813 --> 19:08.848
Who are you talking to?

19:10.116 --> 19:13.461
My ex-boyfriend,
if he doesn't step up his game.

19:13.619 --> 19:14.689
Did you hear me?

19:14.854 --> 19:17.596
Because I'm not gonna wait
around for you to figure it out.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.170
Don't go.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.773
You're hallucinating, which means
that our test doesn't work.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.671
I need to tell Alan.
You can't tell.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.675
I can't keep you here,
you're sick.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.311
I'm not the only one.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.007
How long have you known
about your tumor?

19:36.642 --> 19:38.019
I don't have a tumor.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.784
Please. I'm an oncologist.

19:41.947 --> 19:46.987
Slurring speech, tremors,
prescription vial of Gabapentin.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.363
I haven't told anyone.

19:53.559 --> 19:58.702
Doctor-patient privilege goes both ways.
It'll be our secret.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.146
How long does this usually take?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.386
As long as it takes.

20:08.507 --> 20:11.249
You can't rush these things.
This is the real deal.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.084
Building blocks of life
and all that.

20:14.246 --> 20:17.318
It's hard to be patient
listening to your crappy music.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.889
Please tell me that means something.
Oh, yes.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.059
Say hello to my little friend.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.761
An RNA map of the virus should
show us what's under the hood.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.405
Weird.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.741
I've never seen
this combination before.

20:34.433 --> 20:38.279
Meaning?
Meaning someone designed this virus,

20:38.437 --> 20:41.179
and it sure as shit
wasn't Mother Nature.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.115
We're looking at
the hand of man here.

20:43.609 --> 20:48.558
Proteins specifically designed
to bind the virus to specific cells

20:48.714 --> 20:52.127
so it can deliver its genetic message.
What's the message?

20:52.284 --> 20:54.286
Can you tell
what they designed it to do?

20:54.453 --> 20:56.023
No.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.463
But I can find out.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.785
Hey, Sarah.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.281
How is he?

21:21.447 --> 21:25.589
At least he has bottled oxygen,
unlike the rest of us.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.489
You okay? You feeling the CO2 yet?

21:29.555 --> 21:32.627
No. Um...

21:39.431 --> 21:42.275
I was going over
the rapid response test.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.409
I was rechecking them and, um...

21:48.908 --> 21:50.581
Alan?

21:55.581 --> 21:57.288
Peter?

22:00.419 --> 22:02.524
Peter, can you see me?

22:03.189 --> 22:05.169
Of course I can see you.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.797
Who's the pretty one?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.379
Sarah. Sarah,

22:18.537 --> 22:20.517
this is my brother Peter.

22:29.381 --> 22:34.524
Sarah, you had something you wanted to
tell me about the rapid response test?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.364
It doesn't work.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.734
What do you mean,
it doesn't work?

22:47.900 --> 22:53.680
I was archiving the results and I found a
flaw in the cell line cycling protocol.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.409
We can't trust any of the results.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.986
Are there any infected
on this floor?

22:58.811 --> 22:59.915
No.

23:00.079 --> 23:04.528
No one's reported in but we can't trust
that everyone downstairs is a positive.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.858
I'm really sorry I let you down.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.932
And Walker.
No. Don't...

23:12.091 --> 23:15.197
I made a mistake, there's no excuse.
Right, now you get to fix it.

23:15.361 --> 23:18.103
Have you isolated the flaw?
I'm working on it.

23:18.264 --> 23:19.709
All right, work faster.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.277
Then find Hatake and tell him
we need to implement

23:22.434 --> 23:26.041
a base-wide retesting protocol,
then open Level R, all right?

23:26.205 --> 23:29.948
The sooner this gets done, the sooner
we can get those people out of there.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.881
Right.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.561
Security's checking in.

23:38.717 --> 23:43.928
People are reporting headaches, fatigue,
which are early signs of CO2 poisoning.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.763
We need to get down
to Level R and handle this.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.733
What am I looking at?

23:54.733 --> 23:56.303
<i>Access granted.</i>

24:21.160 --> 24:23.800
I don't know quite how
to say this,

24:24.930 --> 24:29.174
but things have gone downhill
since you were infected.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.448
No shit?

24:33.339 --> 24:35.182
Peter.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.821
I know you're weak,

24:40.612 --> 24:43.183
but I have so many questions,

24:43.349 --> 24:46.694
about your work here,
about this place.

24:47.987 --> 24:52.129
Seventy-thirty?
You're not taking any of the risk.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.037
What?
Okay, all right,

24:55.194 --> 24:57.868
Sixty-forty, final offer.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.671
You never know what's gonna
come out of the old man's pockets.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.978
Sixty-forty is just fine with me, buddy.
Okay.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.814
You go hide,
I'll find you when it's done.

25:10.976 --> 25:14.116
I will stay right here with you,
if that's okay.

25:14.279 --> 25:19.160
It's dangerous.
I know. it's okay. It's okay.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.559
Fleming's Commander Jamaica rum.

25:23.989 --> 25:25.866
That was the old man's poison.

25:26.892 --> 25:30.840
You'd think a mean scumbag like him
would be a bourbon drunk.

25:31.730 --> 25:35.303
You ever try that stuff?
He's dead.

25:37.036 --> 25:42.179
Been gone a long time.
He cant hurl us anymore.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.757
Something about being
trapped in this place,

25:49.548 --> 25:52.927
I see that bastard
around every corner.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.508
Snake eyes.

26:19.111 --> 26:22.524
Hey, let us in.
Not so loud, Jaye.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.459
Shut the hell up. You're
gonna attract the vectors.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.223
- Then open the door.
- We don't have any room.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.697
Bullshit, let us in.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.432
Please.
Shh.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.364
Do you hear that?

26:35.527 --> 26:38.064
Let us in!
Shut up. Come on.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.884
How is he?

26:57.049 --> 27:00.462
Well, he won't talk about much
of anything but our childhood.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.292
Delirium?
Uh, no.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.766
I mean, he's in and out of it,
but I don't know, it's hard to say.

27:06.925 --> 27:12.238
He just... He's stuck back there.
Are these the viral load comparisons?

27:12.397 --> 27:16.971
They were declining after the SODRA
infusions took hold, but now...

27:18.937 --> 27:23.352
This looks like the virus
is coming back. With a vengeance.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.747
You knew we were
taking a chance.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.183
I'm sorry.
But it was working.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.192
I mean, maybe we could
be more aggressive.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.821
We've already given him
a larger dose than any of my studies.

27:36.855 --> 27:40.598
Any more could trigger
a cascade of antiviral toxicity.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.966
There's nothing we can do.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.337
How long does he have?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.310
If you've got anything to say to him...

27:53.472 --> 27:56.180
take this time
and make the most of it.

28:02.781 --> 28:06.820
Peter, we need to talk about...
The treatment we're trying is

28:07.386 --> 28:09.662
Aw, hell, I know that tone.
Highly experimental.

28:09.821 --> 28:13.860
Every time Mom turn a turn, you'd
have that sad-sack look on your face.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.164
How bad?

28:18.463 --> 28:21.205
Jesus, don't sugarcoat it.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.544
I'm sorry.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.414
I have to ask some questions.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.582
There are things going on here
that we can't explain.

28:35.747 --> 28:36.851
And you think I can?

28:37.015 --> 28:39.495
Some of it may have
to do with your research.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.658
You were the genius in the family,

28:41.820 --> 28:45.029
and you couldn't figure out that
I've been doing shit work up here?

28:45.190 --> 28:46.191
What do you mean?

28:46.358 --> 28:49.828
I thought Hatake recruited me
to do next-gen stuff.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.670
This was gonna be my ticket to the show.
Just tell me about the virus.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.938
Hatake had me doing animal
necropsies for the other docs.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.714
I was never the alpha.

29:00.539 --> 29:03.452
The only part of my life Hatake
seemed interested in was...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.553
Julia.

29:08.780 --> 29:13.456
How did he know about her?
He's got ears everywhere.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.623
I mean, he was the only one
around here who ever wanted to talk.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.766
I drove you away, I owed you better.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.576
No, you know I'm right.

29:31.036 --> 29:34.040
I could have been there, but I didn't...

29:35.707 --> 29:39.245
I didn't wanna owe you anymore,
not for Dad, not for anyone.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.914
Don't do that.
You were the one who stuck up for me.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.287
The one running interference
with the old man.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.487
I envied you.
That's why I wasn't there.

29:47.653 --> 29:51.100
From the moment she showed up...
That's why the two of you

29:51.290 --> 29:53.793
ended up together.

29:54.426 --> 29:57.964
That night.
Ll wasn't just that night.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.744
It was before.

30:02.467 --> 30:06.643
Every once in a while, when
we'd travel to some conference.

30:07.939 --> 30:14.914
Even after you ended things, we knew
we couldn't stop seeing each other.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.185
That's why I came up here.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.322
I couldn't stay away.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.926
I went as far as I could.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.667
I'm so sorry.

30:40.872 --> 30:42.783
He's crashing!

31:31.823 --> 31:33.894
Dr. Hatake?

32:03.889 --> 32:05.891
Gabapentin.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.264
Gabapentin, come on, come on.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.792
Three hours after
completion of SODRA protocol,

32:39.958 --> 32:42.234
patient experienced
cardiac arrest,

32:42.394 --> 32:46.433
congruent with
overwhelming viremic sepsis.

32:47.232 --> 32:52.341
This time with concomitant catastrophic
decrease in brainwave activity.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.582
Patient has been fitted
with a defib vest,

32:55.740 --> 33:01.588
is now intubated and on artificial
respiration in a vegetative state.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.495
It's unlikely that the patient
will regain consciousness,

33:05.650 --> 33:09.257
or be able to maintain his own life
without the ventilator.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.674
I can feel their hands on me,
dragging me away.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.041
Please make them stop.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.203
Doctor's orders.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.876
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.111
I'm not gonna let them take you,
I promise.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.999
I knew I could trust you
to protect me from them.

34:23.527 --> 34:27.065
Did Hell you or did I tell you?
There's enough food here for weeks.

34:27.232 --> 34:31.179
Do you know what this means?
Mm. Cheese spread three meals a day?

34:31.335 --> 34:33.407
Good thing you know
your way around this base.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.444
Looks like I'm not the only one.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.027
What is it?

34:51.856 --> 34:53.529
It's my initials,

34:54.391 --> 34:56.463
Julia Lynn Walker.

34:56.628 --> 35:01.976
Hell of a coincidence.
No, it isn't. It can't be.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.407
Can't be what?

35:05.203 --> 35:06.409
It's my writing.

35:08.907 --> 35:13.822
The way I wrote my name
and the flower, evening primrose.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.918
It was my favorite when I was
a girl. It grows in Montana.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.629
I have notebooks full of them.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.503
I did this.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.835
I've been here before.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.103
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

35:39.838 --> 35:41.818
<i>Environmental alert.</i>

35:46.611 --> 35:48.249
Gentlemen.

35:50.181 --> 35:51.751
We need to have a talk.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.488
Put down the weapons,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.464
they won't be necessary.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.036
Forgive us if we don't agree.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.332
Depriving this base of oxygen
is murder.

36:05.497 --> 36:09.604
What about locking us up with barely
any supplies and no treatment?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.441
It is only a temporary quarantine.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.684
Maybe you should
stay down here with us.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.847
Then we'll see your definition
of "temporary."

36:22.013 --> 36:26.792
You are right.
I'm not standing in your shoes.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.397
I had to make a hard choice.

36:29.554 --> 36:32.967
You're playing with our lives.
I'm not.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.468
Your lives are worth
no less than mine.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.629
You are lying.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.902
Why else would I come down here
with only one man?

36:41.066 --> 36:43.546
You could kill us both.

36:43.702 --> 36:48.208
If we fight, we die.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.844
Together,

36:51.976 --> 36:54.183
we survive.

37:00.552 --> 37:04.227
We have your word?
My word of honor.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.026
Thank you.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.496
They were about to give up.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.807
Why did you...?

38:22.667 --> 38:25.170
Why?
They gave up,

38:25.336 --> 38:27.748
but they did not surrender.

38:27.939 --> 38:31.113
They were willing to kill us.
Maybe not today.

38:31.276 --> 38:34.280
They would not have stopped.
We could have just locked them up.

38:34.445 --> 38:37.654
You shot an unarmed woman
less than 36 hours ago.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.660
To protect you.
I just returned the favor.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.462
Dispose of the bodies
and go back upstairs.

38:47.458 --> 38:50.962
You're not coming?
I have something to take care of.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.838
Dr. Walker? Why take the risk?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.211
I need you upstairs.

39:01.105 --> 39:06.646
As far as I can see, the genetic message
inside the virus is a massive splice job.

39:06.811 --> 39:10.816
Real cutting-edge,
from animal and human species.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.984
And here's where
it gets interesting.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.124
How is that interesting?
Because it's completely unknown.

39:19.958 --> 39:24.236
Ran it against every
genetic sequence known to man.

39:24.395 --> 39:27.672
This is a completely
unidentified single strand.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.044
Why would anyone wanna
put that inside of us?

39:31.202 --> 39:33.910
I don't have a clue,
but it scares the crap out of me.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.576
There's some trait
that they want us to manifest,

39:38.142 --> 39:41.749
and this disease
is a way to force it in.

39:42.180 --> 39:46.822
The people who designed this virus
wanna change us from the inside out.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.735
I mean, I may not be perfect,
but I like what I am.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.533
I like you too, Doreen.

39:57.528 --> 40:00.202
Well, we're not infected yet.

40:02.767 --> 40:05.611
We'll take this to Alan,
get to the bottom of it,

40:05.770 --> 40:10.446
slop whoever's doing this
before they cause any real damage.

40:11.576 --> 40:15.114
Hey, what's wrong? Heh.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.918
This was your idea
to begin with.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.690
You were right.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.357
I know.

40:28.793 --> 40:31.467
Sorry, Doreen. I'm so sorry.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.757
