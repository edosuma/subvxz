<i>All Hitman Two Victors, maintain speed,

- One o'clock, two kliks, how copy?
- Contact right!

01:02.960 --> 01:05.284
Enemy foot-mobiles,

01:05.447 --> 01:07.078
This is Hitman Two One. Roger that.

01:23.122 --> 01:25.138
<i>Misfit Two One, cleared hot.</i>

01:25.342 --> 01:26.450
<i>Missile away.</i>

01:27.434 --> 01:28.392
Get some!

01:29.997 --> 01:31.144
Watch your sectors.

01:38.822 --> 01:40.672
<i>Misfit Two Two, cleared hot.</i>

01:41.319 --> 01:42.280
<i>Missile away.</i>

01:48.281 --> 01:50.903
- Is there any contact on the left?
- Contact right.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.081
R.P.G. team,

01:52.285 --> 01:54.667
two o'clock...
500 meters behind the truck.

01:54.829 --> 01:57.129
Shit. We'll get some later.

02:08.324 --> 02:11.463
<i>This is Hitman two.
We have suppressed a zil six by six.</i>

02:11.583 --> 02:13.812
<i>Request that Misfit pushes north
to sweep flank</i>

02:14.062 --> 02:15.939
<i>to search for possible targets.</i>

02:16.832 --> 02:19.108
<i>- Misfit Two One, copy.
- We barbecued them hajis.</i>

02:24.951 --> 02:26.491
Bravo Two One, man down!

02:27.083 --> 02:29.911
<i>- Echo Four Lima is down.
- Lilley's hit! He's hit!</i>

02:31.081 --> 02:34.041
He's stopping.
Two One Alpha, interrogative.

02:35.294 --> 02:36.417
<i>Push, push...</i>

02:36.621 --> 02:38.753
<i>- Get out of the kill zone.
- Grab the wheel!</i>

02:41.021 --> 02:43.671
<i>Two Three,
make the hole for Two One Bravo.</i>

02:50.171 --> 02:51.809
Stop the vehicles!

02:56.205 --> 02:57.307
Corpsman!

02:58.267 --> 02:59.837
- I'm on it!
- Got a man hit!

02:59.957 --> 03:02.319
Two One Bravo's got a man hit!
Come on!

03:02.688 --> 03:05.757
Don't waste the morphine, doc.
My boy's been smoked.

03:05.877 --> 03:07.365
Is anybody else hit?

03:10.145 --> 03:11.995
How's it feel, motherfucker?

03:12.210 --> 03:14.463
How's it feel to be fucking dead?

03:14.583 --> 03:15.933
Bro, it feels sad.

03:16.769 --> 03:18.246
I feel very alone.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.745
And also,

03:21.450 --> 03:22.714
I gotta take a shit.

03:23.793 --> 03:25.758
- I told you...
- Damn, man, and I had dibs

03:25.920 --> 03:28.636
- on your video camera.
- I had dibs on your wife.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.714
- You make a nice casualty. Congrats.
- Yeah, you die real good.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.026
{All right, }Team leaders,
let's do a little after-action on this.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.235
Hell, yeah!

03:35.930 --> 03:39.097
This was the first time the boys
got to live-fire any mark-19s or. 50s.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.026
Might be the only chance we get
before we step off.

03:42.146 --> 03:43.563
Be nice if it were otherwise.

03:43.683 --> 03:46.587
It'd {Iso }be nice if we got some batteries
for our pec-fours and pec-thirteens.

03:46.707 --> 03:49.283
Our ops chief assures me they're coming.
I'm assured of this.

03:49.773 --> 03:53.036
I've never seen a fifty cal fuck up
a truck before. That was cool.

03:53.485 --> 03:54.872
{I wonder what it would look like if you hit a person. }
What if it hits a person?

03:55.258 --> 03:57.382
At least you got to fire yours.

03:57.522 --> 03:59.712
She didn't even shoot off round one.

03:59.832 --> 04:03.047
Trombley, if you keep talking
to your weapon like it's trim,

04:03.207 --> 04:05.081
everybody's gonna know
you're a total psycho.

04:09.121 --> 04:12.141
We were good
until Espera's team went down.

04:12.422 --> 04:15.127
You slowed your vehicles.
You don't stop in a kill zone.

04:15.247 --> 04:17.880
You mean maneuver past the vehicles down
and leave them?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.528
You know the S.O.P:
assault through the ambush,

04:20.841 --> 04:23.318
anybody's left behind,
you maneuver to do support by fire.

04:23.438 --> 04:25.943
None of us are good to anybody
if we're dead.

04:26.063 --> 04:27.956
Sir, not to question the S.O.P,

04:28.308 --> 04:30.244
but if we have a disabled vehicle

04:30.364 --> 04:32.823
the nearest element
could stop and evaluate the Marines

04:32.943 --> 04:35.412
while other elements push through
and provide support by fire.

04:40.562 --> 04:41.759
Yeah, that works, Brad,

04:41.879 --> 04:44.588
but only if you don't let emotions
take over as you assess the situation.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.464
But on principle it works.

04:46.843 --> 04:47.967
It's good.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.260
All right, got half an hour
to get back to Mathilda for chow.

04:53.441 --> 04:55.011
Fucking Kuwait, man.

05:03.409 --> 05:04.971
You believe this shit?

05:05.310 --> 05:08.690
These people still haven't picked up
the trash from the last war.

05:09.698 --> 05:13.089
People been fighting over this bitch
since ancient times, Dawg.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.451
How many graves we standing on?

05:18.027 --> 05:19.665
Think about
all the wisdom and science

05:21.308 --> 05:23.794
and money and civilization it took
to build these machines,

05:25.321 --> 05:28.340
and the courage
of all the men who came here,

05:29.624 --> 05:33.374
and the love of their wives and children
that was in their hearts.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.725
And all that hate, Dawg,

05:38.625 --> 05:41.770
all the hate it took
to blow these motherfuckers away.

05:43.812 --> 05:45.262
It's destiny, Dawg.

05:45.810 --> 05:48.020
White man's gotta rule the world.

05:56.278 --> 05:58.627
<i>Hitman Two Two, this is Two One Bravo.</i>

05:58.747 --> 06:02.397
<i>Our gunner has a silhouette
at our nine o'clock, two kliks out.</i>

06:03.435 --> 06:05.815
<i>Roger, we glassed it.
It's a disabled vehicle.</i>

06:05.935 --> 06:07.285
<i>It's static. Over.</i>

06:19.308 --> 06:22.817
You know, people forget
the brain is the biggest erogenous zone.

06:22.937 --> 06:25.022
- Maybe on you.
- Man, fuck you.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.976
Take a look at that!

06:34.499 --> 06:35.637
Hey, man.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.247
You seen Person?

06:39.614 --> 06:40.922
Over there, Brah.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.209
- Shitbird, you watch it.
- Got a couple new ones...

06:45.329 --> 06:48.105
And this one little Chinese girl
had eyes so slanty,

06:48.225 --> 06:50.935
you could've blindfolded her
with dental floss, I swear...

06:52.486 --> 06:54.668
You gotta get tight
on a motherfucker's windpipe...

06:54.788 --> 06:55.842
Get off me.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.388
Right as she's pulling
the vibrating egg out,

06:58.508 --> 07:00.240
she fuckin' licks my asshole.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.093
Ray, did you get the word, man?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.217
- J. Lo's dead.
- Bullshit!

07:04.337 --> 07:06.342
Yeah, I got the word
from a Captain in G2.

07:06.462 --> 07:08.516
- {Brad, }Did you hear about J. Lo?
- Get over here, Ray.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.925
Need my R.T.O.

07:10.789 --> 07:12.345
- Did Conway tell you that?
- Yeah.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.562
- Yeah, {well, }he's full of shit.
- No, man.

07:15.187 --> 07:16.203
Bravo Two!

07:16.714 --> 07:18.264
All of you, listen up.

07:19.369 --> 07:21.733
H&S company
had a negligent discharge today.

07:21.853 --> 07:23.163
Fuckin' supply company...

07:23.323 --> 07:25.718
So the C.O. {personally }wants to make sure
we brass-check our weapons.

07:25.838 --> 07:28.292
- Anybody hurt?
- No, it was a two-oh-three.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.500
- It's a miracle no one was killed.
- That would suck, homes,

07:31.768 --> 07:34.444
getting killed before you got
to go to war and kill people.

07:34.564 --> 07:36.779
And try wrapping up the chess tourney
before lights out.

07:36.899 --> 07:39.095
- Got the Sergeant Major on my ass.
- Fuckin' Sixta.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.926
Lieutenant,

07:43.266 --> 07:45.838
- have you gotten any word?
- I only get what's passed down to me

07:46.096 --> 07:49.497
from Godfather and the only word he gets
is from the BBC.

07:50.088 --> 07:52.860
If we're lucky, Saddam will {ack down, }let
the inspectors in and we can go home.

07:53.525 --> 07:56.529
The important thing is,
we are doing our jobs by being here.

07:56.649 --> 07:58.030
All of you should be proud.

07:58.150 --> 08:00.217
Sir, that's not the word
I was asking about.

08:00.337 --> 08:03.828
We wanted to know if you knew anything
about J. Lo being killed.

08:04.223 --> 08:06.540
- Who killed her?
- Shit, you know she's my cousin.

08:07.039 --> 08:09.362
She's Puerto Rican. You're Mexican.

08:10.585 --> 08:14.088
Ray, the Battalion Commander
offered no sit-rep as to J. Lo's status.

08:14.858 --> 08:17.678
- Piece of shit.
- Puerto Ricans are tropical Mexicans.

08:20.311 --> 08:21.913
What? J. Lo's dead?

08:22.343 --> 08:24.141
Apparently that's the word.

08:34.716 --> 08:37.028
- Roger that, Sergeant.
- Bring your canteen.

08:37.573 --> 08:39.712
It'{s gonna}ll be hotter than 2 rabbits
fucking in a wool sock

08:39.832 --> 08:41.616
out there in that motor pool.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.119
Since when did the Marine corps
start letting in faggots?

08:47.024 --> 08:48.363
Dawg, you're my driver.

08:48.483 --> 08:51.210
How you gonna make your war movie
when you'{e gonna}ll be {usy}driving my Humvee?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.092
Brah...

08:55.212 --> 08:57.507
{What do }You think CNN's gonna want
to buy your version of the war?

08:58.964 --> 08:59.764
Maybe.

09:01.363 --> 09:04.114
You know, you'd be better off
shooting Rudy.

09:04.974 --> 09:07.017
Now that is some shit
you could sell right there.

09:08.516 --> 09:09.387
Brah...

09:09.712 --> 09:10.786
Gay porn!

09:11.396 --> 09:12.563
Gay porn, Lilley!

09:13.569 --> 09:17.361
{Yo, all you gotta do is}Get Rudy on board, and you gonna be
the next Spielberg of twink movies.

09:19.663 --> 09:21.778
You're always doing that shit
with that rook.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.948
The same move every fuckin' day.

09:29.559 --> 09:31.090
How's that for a move?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.748
Checkmate, bitch.

09:44.398 --> 09:45.348
Get some!

09:46.071 --> 09:47.640
Let's go! Slay that dragon!

09:48.233 --> 09:50.601
- Get some!
- I love you, Fruity Rudy!

09:52.168 --> 09:54.478
Today's high is expected
to be 85 Fahrenheit,

09:54.598 --> 09:56.505
nightly lows expected again
in the upper 30s

09:56.625 --> 09:59.159
with Shamal winds moving in tomorrow

09:59.279 --> 10:01.843
gusting up to 70 miles per hour.

10:02.837 --> 10:03.637
Sir.

10:05.193 --> 10:08.077
Weather's got a better chance
of atritting us than the Iraqis.

10:10.211 --> 10:13.102
Word from the C.G.
is to maintain our readiness

10:13.872 --> 10:16.586
and ongoing preparations
to enhance our readiness

10:17.326 --> 10:18.506
here in Kuwait.

10:18.626 --> 10:20.410
What does Godfather think?

10:20.961 --> 10:22.966
I think, in other words,

10:23.822 --> 10:24.761
no word.

10:26.506 --> 10:29.211
Our objective
remains getting into that A-O,

10:29.676 --> 10:32.193
securing that bridge over the Euphrates,

10:32.471 --> 10:35.209
and holding it
for the main Marine Force.

10:37.586 --> 10:40.259
Rolling through Iraq in open-top Humvees

10:40.379 --> 10:43.029
is completely outside
of what first recon does.

10:43.845 --> 10:45.450
We might not like it,

10:45.706 --> 10:49.286
but the general has asked this battalion
to be America's shock troops.

10:49.773 --> 10:52.121
And Godfather can't tell the general
"we don't do windows. "

10:55.999 --> 10:58.755
Sir, Alpha company's
still missing maps of the A-O.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.589
The problem is battalion-wide
and we are working on it, be assured.

11:06.538 --> 11:09.651
What is the policy
on the wearing of the beanies?

11:09.967 --> 11:11.676
When should they be worn?

11:13.249 --> 11:15.519
Maintaing a grooming standard
is mission critical.

11:16.704 --> 11:18.982
Just because these men
fancy themselves an elite unit

11:19.549 --> 11:21.457
doesn't mean they own the rules.

11:21.996 --> 11:24.520
Between 0900 and 1700

11:24.926 --> 11:26.423
watch caps are a no-go.

11:26.648 --> 11:30.647
I don't want us to see no cowboy elvises
walking around in them beanies.

11:32.084 --> 11:32.907
All right,

11:33.955 --> 11:36.416
division has handed down change
in the signals protocol...

11:40.730 --> 11:44.446
All my hoses are rotted out.
I got dirty earl working it.

11:44.566 --> 11:46.779
Got a mess of blown donkey dicks.

11:46.899 --> 11:48.404
On a short string here.

11:48.524 --> 11:51.515
I just got this bucket five days ago.
This is like "Gilligan's Island. "

11:51.925 --> 11:54.183
They're giving us rocks and conuts
to make radios...

11:54.763 --> 11:56.858
Even the gaskets are gone, man.

11:56.978 --> 12:00.019
Back home, they're driving around
in Mercedes Benz SUVs

12:00.139 --> 12:02.776
picking up their poodles
at the dog cappuccino stand.

12:03.104 --> 12:06.312
And here we are invading a country
with ghetto hoopties.

12:06.432 --> 12:07.897
It's depressing.

12:10.774 --> 12:11.909
What the fuck?

12:12.429 --> 12:13.967
Where the fuck you find those?

12:14.087 --> 12:16.655
I had to suck an officer's cock
to get these.

12:16.775 --> 12:18.925
See? That's some exploitive shit.

12:19.648 --> 12:21.591
You been exploited by your betters.

12:21.711 --> 12:24.456
You know what we need in America?
Is a holiday

12:24.709 --> 12:26.807
where once a year the blue-collar man

12:26.927 --> 12:30.011
gets to go into the home
of the white-collar man, eat his food,

12:30.171 --> 12:32.389
sleep in his bed and fuck his shit up.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.700
- Jeff, you realize you're a communist?
- Fuck I am.

12:37.148 --> 12:38.698
A blue force tracker.

12:41.768 --> 12:42.941
Downtown Baghdad,

12:44.089 --> 12:45.297
Safwan Hill...

12:46.585 --> 12:47.611
The entire A-O.

12:48.189 --> 12:49.905
You are the Iceman, Dawg.

12:50.025 --> 12:53.603
You up here in the 21st century,
we're all back there in the stone age{,man}.

12:55.490 --> 12:57.426
Third infantry to the east,

12:57.939 --> 12:58.747
us,

13:00.233 --> 13:02.073
our neighbors to the north,

13:02.495 --> 13:04.115
and the Euphrates bridge,

13:04.235 --> 13:05.486
our objective.

13:06.438 --> 13:08.160
Jesus Christ!

13:09.931 --> 13:12.853
What is you,
some kind of goddamn hippy faggot?!

13:13.720 --> 13:14.969
Fuck is this?

13:15.574 --> 13:16.741
Damn it all.

13:17.319 --> 13:19.259
Why the fuck
is your shirt out of regulation?

13:19.379 --> 13:21.066
Sergeant Major, is there a problem?

13:21.186 --> 13:23.446
My Marines have been working
on that Humvee all morning.

13:23.566 --> 13:24.670
I don't care

13:25.055 --> 13:27.527
if your Marine
has a sucking chest wound!

13:27.956 --> 13:31.697
He will not traipse around on the deck
with his shirttails hanging out!

13:32.442 --> 13:34.518
Might just N.J.P all your asses!

13:35.506 --> 13:36.956
Yes, Sergeant Major.

13:37.332 --> 13:38.818
Corporal person, be advised,

13:38.938 --> 13:40.790
you'{e expected to}ll conduct all business in this camp

13:40.950 --> 13:42.792
in compliance
with the grooming standard,

13:43.304 --> 13:46.341
under direct order
from the Battalion Commander himself.

13:54.149 --> 13:55.475
Sergeant Patrick,

13:56.951 --> 13:59.641
your mustache hairs is in violations,

14:00.646 --> 14:02.604
growing beyond the corner of your mouth.

14:03.811 --> 14:06.954
I hear Godfather himself
say you look like a bum.

14:08.443 --> 14:09.993
Police that mustache!

14:15.086 --> 14:17.076
Yes, sir!
And you look like elvises!

14:21.952 --> 14:23.353
Don't push our luck.

14:25.178 --> 14:25.980
Walt!

14:28.999 --> 14:29.908
Trombley.

14:34.105 --> 14:35.295
Nothing but letters.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.966
No batteries, no diapers, and no turret.

14:39.042 --> 14:40.692
Guess not today, homes.

14:41.220 --> 14:45.006
Just another five dozen letters
from fuckin' schoolkids and shit.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.659
Listen to this.
"Dear Mr. Army men... "

14:59.292 --> 15:00.547
Army? Fuck that.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.123
"... I am proud that you are being brave
and defending

15:03.284 --> 15:05.107
"our country against the terrorists.

15:05.227 --> 15:08.460
They are bad and I am glad that you are
going to catch them and punish them. "

15:08.621 --> 15:09.489
{She's a }Good writer.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.589
"... I am glad that you are so brave
and I pray for you. "

15:12.709 --> 15:15.790
- What's she look like?
- She's actually pretty hot.

15:17.044 --> 15:19.532
- I like them braids.
- Let me see, man.

15:19.883 --> 15:21.533
Listen to this shit right here.

15:21.653 --> 15:24.158
"Maybe you'll be able to come home
without having to fight. "

15:24.278 --> 15:26.220
- Bullshit.
- Fuck that.

15:26.340 --> 15:29.219
"Peace is {Iways much }better than war and it would
be nice if no one would be hurt. "

15:29.339 --> 15:30.780
Hippy communist shit.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.864
- Where {	he fuck }is this weak-ass child from?
- Vermont!

15:32.984 --> 15:35.696
Frederick Firestone from 2707

15:35.816 --> 15:37.824
Spencer road, Chevy Chase, Maryland.

15:38.161 --> 15:39.993
- Fucking Maryland.
- "Dear Frederick!

15:40.525 --> 15:41.969
"Thank you for your nice letter.

15:42.089 --> 15:44.997
"But I am actually a U.S. Marine who was

15:45.265 --> 15:46.677
"born to kill,

15:46.797 --> 15:49.421
"whereas clearly you have mistaken me
for some sort of

15:49.541 --> 15:52.040
"wine-sipping communist dick-suck.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.117
"And although peace probably appeals
to tree-loving bisexuals

15:56.336 --> 15:59.095
"like you and your parents,
I happen to be

15:59.454 --> 16:02.101
"a death-dealing, blood-crazed warrior

16:02.221 --> 16:04.587
"who wakes up every day just hoping

16:04.707 --> 16:06.977
"for the chance to dismember my enemies

16:07.138 --> 16:09.228
"and defile their civilizations.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.790
"Peace sucks a hairy asshole, Freddie.

16:11.910 --> 16:14.576
- "War is the motherfucking answer. "
- Hell, yeah!

16:14.847 --> 16:17.195
- "But thanks for writing anyway. "
- "Your pal, Ray. "

16:17.315 --> 16:21.224
Man, every motherfucker in this camp
is just waiting for packages of dip,

16:21.344 --> 16:24.829
ripped fuel, porn mags,
batteries, hash chunks,

16:25.182 --> 16:28.478
a dirty-ass jerk-off letter
from Suzie Rottencrotch.

16:28.598 --> 16:31.367
Except for Brad Colbert over here
who actually thinks

16:31.487 --> 16:34.506
that his mail-order turret
is gonna come in before we step off.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.229
- Sorry, Brad.
- But no.

16:36.349 --> 16:39.479
All we get is this happy day
fucking horseshit from Miss cuntlips'

16:39.599 --> 16:42.103
fourth-grade class.
Can you fucking believe this shit?

16:42.223 --> 16:43.073
Oh, bro.

16:44.288 --> 16:45.088
Damn.

16:47.035 --> 16:49.727
I'd eat a mile of her shit
just to see where it came from.

16:49.847 --> 16:51.425
Take her diaper off.

17:00.845 --> 17:04.469
Pass the word. Watch caps
are a no-go between 0900 and 1700.

17:04.728 --> 17:06.535
That's Godfather talking.

17:07.481 --> 17:08.497
Brah.

17:10.222 --> 17:11.021
What?

17:11.285 --> 17:13.165
- You got sauce on you.
- Oh, yeah?

17:13.285 --> 17:17.049
I look like a mud?
I look like Gabe's filthy spic brother?

17:26.008 --> 17:28.977
- What the fuck is on your grape{, devil dog}?
- My boonie. Give me it back.

17:29.097 --> 17:32.547
You see any other Recon Marine in here
wearing a soft cover?

17:35.599 --> 17:37.214
No fucking way, Dawg.

17:38.107 --> 17:41.029
I know you didn't go through B.R.C,
but, boy, you gotta front.

17:41.470 --> 17:45.043
All these other grunts look up to recon
like we are cold-blooded warriors.

17:45.163 --> 17:49.037
We're carnivorous motherfuckers,
and you gotta carry it like that.

17:54.958 --> 17:55.856
Here.

17:56.156 --> 17:57.685
I got your six, boy.

18:06.494 --> 18:07.586
This motherfucker.

18:07.706 --> 18:09.063
F.N.G., Sergeant.

18:23.212 --> 18:24.662
Cocky motherfuckers.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.123
<i>The American Department of State
has ordered all non-essential...</i>

18:30.243 --> 18:33.832
{Okay,}Check it. The escort V.H.F. Watson
gave us was in E.O.R. and it's U.H.F.

18:34.151 --> 18:36.006
Both the D.A.S.C.
and the D.A.S.C.- A, right?

18:36.126 --> 18:38.189
<i>- President Bush...
- Hold on. I want to hear this.</i>

18:38.309 --> 18:41.673
<i>...{Prime Minister Tony Blair }and Spanish Prime Minister,
José Maria Aznar...</i>

18:41.840 --> 18:43.590
I'd chili-dog that bitch.

18:44.012 --> 18:46.136
- Nice.
- You think that's enough?

18:46.256 --> 18:48.092
You should be rockin' it like me, Pappy.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.933
- Hitler 'stache is reg.
- Looked good on Hitler.

18:51.527 --> 18:52.527
<i>In sport...</i>

18:52.818 --> 18:55.153
- No dead fly girl.
- The media's in on it.

18:55.273 --> 18:57.469
They don't want us to know J. Lo's dead.

18:57.589 --> 18:59.608
They think it will fuck with morale.

19:01.981 --> 19:05.674
On the C.E.O.I. they have
the escorts listed as no encryption,

19:05.794 --> 19:07.402
but they're covered, right?

19:07.522 --> 19:09.889
You can't do one frequency plain.

19:10.213 --> 19:12.663
Don't matter on the 113s anyway.
They only go to six.

19:17.370 --> 19:18.592
What the hell was that?

19:18.712 --> 19:21.630
- Not again.
- I need Marines with sledgehammers!

19:21.833 --> 19:24.132
- Let's go.
- Come on, you heard him!

19:29.799 --> 19:31.499
Pull it! Come on!

19:42.996 --> 19:43.778
You,

19:45.573 --> 19:46.829
get over there!

19:49.153 --> 19:50.952
- Come on!
- Hold it down!

20:21.860 --> 20:24.068
Shame about your tent, sir.
Put these with my gear.

20:24.188 --> 20:25.113
Yes sir.

20:36.157 --> 20:37.025
Pappy.

20:38.118 --> 20:39.715
I gotta be at battalion for a while,

20:39.835 --> 20:41.857
so make sure nothing happens
when I'm there.

20:41.977 --> 20:43.760
This is a writer
who's gonna embed with us.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.563
<i>- He's from Rolling Stone, so be gentle.
- The Rolling Stones?</i>

20:50.713 --> 20:51.863
<i>Rolling Stone?</i>

20:52.291 --> 20:55.990
Fuck if they don't give us
a dope-smoking, peace-freak writer.

20:56.110 --> 20:57.185
Christeson,

20:57.692 --> 20:59.979
<i>show Rolling Stone Magazine
where to stow his shit.</i>

21:01.153 --> 21:04.348
You gonna write about how we're all
baby killers and ma rapers?

21:04.468 --> 21:06.595
<i>You gonna tell all them people
who read Rolling Stone</i>

21:06.715 --> 21:08.965
how it fucking feels to be in a war?

21:09.085 --> 21:11.759
<i>Actually, most avid readers
of Rolling Stone</i>

21:11.879 --> 21:15.534
only really know what it feels like
to have a cock up their assholes.

21:15.654 --> 21:17.789
<i>Could be worse.
I used to write for Hustler.</i>

21:18.605 --> 21:21.476
<i>- You wrote for Hustler?
- We're in the presence of greatness.</i>

21:21.596 --> 21:23.835
<i>What did you write for Hustler"?</i>

21:25.093 --> 21:26.924
Porn reviews, hot letters,

21:27.898 --> 21:30.428
- beaver hunt.
- You wrote beaver hunt?

21:32.823 --> 21:35.346
- This way, reporter sir.
- This guy wrote beaver hunt!

21:35.466 --> 21:37.725
He must have those polaroids
of your mom.

21:38.642 --> 21:39.661
I'm sorry.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.110
Your rack, sir.

21:50.065 --> 21:52.138
They got you in the fucking ghetto.

21:52.258 --> 21:55.355
Reporter, ever seen a grown man naked?
You feel me?

21:55.942 --> 21:58.297
Fuckin' spics and a goddamn jig.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.186
Yo, that ain't cool, man,

22:01.589 --> 22:03.526
fuckin' race-hating motherfucker.

22:03.646 --> 22:05.969
Spics, a coon, and a fucking wigger.

22:06.465 --> 22:08.161
See, wiggers be the worst...

22:08.281 --> 22:10.382
Race traitors,
miscegenatin' with the muds.

22:13.650 --> 22:17.053
You don't have to listen to this little
trailer-trash-whiskey-tango fuck.

22:17.173 --> 22:20.145
Ain't all your crackhead brothers
nappy-headed and shit?

22:20.265 --> 22:22.235
James is the only white boy
in the family.

22:22.355 --> 22:24.563
Three stepdads, and they're all black.

22:25.404 --> 22:26.954
Take this down, Dawg.

22:27.777 --> 22:29.224
"It makes my heart heavy

22:29.344 --> 22:32.694
"to see the white race sink
as low as James's mother has.

22:33.464 --> 22:36.539
"At least if she was Mexican
she'd be ashamed of herself.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.112
"But being a white bitch,

22:38.232 --> 22:40.842
"she still thinks she's better than
the brothers she sells that ass to

22:40.962 --> 22:44.100
"in the parking lot
of the titty bar she works at. "

22:44.220 --> 22:47.141
- Screwby, Dawg.
- Yo, fuck you, man.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.046
She's a bookkeeper.

22:49.779 --> 22:50.779
Cockkeeper.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.371
Yo, T!

22:54.158 --> 22:57.082
You hear that? The beaners
are cracking on your people too.

22:57.202 --> 22:58.702
Ain't you gonna say something?

22:58.822 --> 23:00.698
I'm just not into that racial thing,
man.

23:00.818 --> 23:01.967
All right.

23:02.087 --> 23:03.298
Let's go, Garza.

23:03.418 --> 23:06.089
Let's talk about what we're gonna do
when we get out of the corps.

23:06.209 --> 23:09.933
We're gonna join us a border patrol
and shoot us some wetbacks.

23:10.231 --> 23:11.546
Shoot wetbacks!

23:12.432 --> 23:13.759
Welcome aboard.

23:15.657 --> 23:18.507
Fuck these turrets!
Shit won't go past my five.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.773
Relax, my manimal.
Pappy will get you fixed up.

23:21.893 --> 23:24.450
- Rudy, hand me your leatherman.
- Roger.

23:27.412 --> 23:29.931
Mr. Potato head at your six,
closing fast.

23:30.187 --> 23:31.535
Sergeant Patrick!

23:31.655 --> 23:32.992
Hold it there!

23:43.654 --> 23:44.922
You mocking me?

23:47.470 --> 23:49.320
Hairs hanging from your face

23:49.548 --> 23:51.260
beyond your mouth areas.

23:52.782 --> 23:55.267
You are unsightly, unsanitary,

23:55.387 --> 23:58.460
and in violations
of Godfather's written standards.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.702
Do you read me, Sergeant Patrick?

24:04.237 --> 24:07.040
You has until o dark hundred
to unfuck yourself.

24:12.376 --> 24:14.112
Godfather tells us two weeks ago

24:14.232 --> 24:16.267
that division's having
a mustache-growing contest.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.901
Now Mr. Potato head here
is lifing-out Pappy.

24:20.545 --> 24:22.174
We all got jobs to do.

24:23.277 --> 24:25.559
Sergeant Major Sixta's job
is to be an asshole,

24:27.120 --> 24:29.146
and he excels at the position.

24:31.421 --> 24:34.958
It's titanium. 16 Ibs, about yeah big.

24:35.529 --> 24:37.176
Should have been shipped weeks ago,

24:37.296 --> 24:39.983
and I was starting to wonder if it was
shortstopped at battalion somewhere.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.133
A shield?

24:41.802 --> 24:43.587
For the main gunner, yeah.

24:44.503 --> 24:45.580
Sergeant Colbert.

24:47.329 --> 24:48.332
It's important.

24:49.959 --> 24:50.992
Gentlemen.

24:54.157 --> 24:57.104
The stove underneath Rudy's espresso pot
went off like a forty mike-mike.

24:57.224 --> 25:00.037
Flamed white boy's face
like a rotisserie chicken.

25:00.157 --> 25:01.907
Let me understand this...

25:02.906 --> 25:04.774
My R.T.O. has just been burned

25:04.894 --> 25:07.559
in his tent by an
exploding portable stove.

25:08.803 --> 25:11.166
And without my R.T.O.,
I will be going to war

25:11.286 --> 25:14.523
unable to quickly and effectively
establish radio communications

25:14.643 --> 25:15.867
within our unit,

25:15.987 --> 25:18.738
with other elements of the battalion,
and with close air support.

25:20.158 --> 25:21.908
Is this what is happening?

25:22.224 --> 25:25.164
That and they're probably gonna N.J.P.
all our asses for operating a stove

25:25.284 --> 25:26.913
in the tent against the regs.

25:27.481 --> 25:29.214
Over an espresso maker?

25:31.409 --> 25:33.230
This platoon is going down

25:34.697 --> 25:36.380
over an espresso maker?

25:37.245 --> 25:39.661
...until division informs me otherwise.

25:39.781 --> 25:41.384
All right, that's all for now.

25:41.546 --> 25:44.221
Keep it tight, gentlemen.
We're on a short string.

25:45.226 --> 25:46.476
Lieutenant Fick.

25:47.538 --> 25:48.454
Yes sir?

25:51.049 --> 25:53.135
Your C.O. passed on your report.

25:53.531 --> 25:56.274
Your unit sustained a casualty.
A marine was burned.

25:57.661 --> 25:59.539
Corporal person sustained minor injuries

25:59.659 --> 26:01.853
when a cookstove being operated
according to regulations

26:01.973 --> 26:03.704
suffered a catastrophic failure.

26:05.345 --> 26:07.481
And the men operating this cookstove

26:07.601 --> 26:09.477
were outside the tent
when this happened?

26:09.597 --> 26:10.490
Yes sir.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.020
At the time, corporal person
was kneeling by the entrance,

26:13.140 --> 26:14.346
servicing a 148.

26:18.790 --> 26:20.910
- And you witnessed this?
- Yes sir.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.726
I observed the stove malfunction,

26:22.846 --> 26:26.063
and the swift action of
my Marines to treat corporal person.

26:29.222 --> 26:30.472
Lieutenant Fick,

26:30.913 --> 26:34.669
you might want to consider writing up
some of these men for commendation.

26:34.932 --> 26:36.620
I will consider that, sir.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.179
Why is the PX at an army camp?

26:49.672 --> 26:53.533
Marines don't need a PX. We're about
to loot and pillage a country!

26:53.653 --> 26:55.775
Then why are we going to the PX?

26:56.760 --> 26:57.966
AAA batteries.

26:59.112 --> 27:02.216
Dip... skoal and Copenhagen,

27:03.642 --> 27:04.703
baby wipes,

27:05.285 --> 27:07.634
various flavored Pringles in a can,

27:09.256 --> 27:11.506
and adult diapers,

27:13.222 --> 27:14.372
as requested.

27:15.709 --> 27:18.354
Why do you need me
to get you all this stuff?

27:18.474 --> 27:19.775
In the infinite wisdom

27:20.144 --> 27:22.505
of whoever runs
the military post-exchange stores,

27:22.625 --> 27:26.441
they won't sell this stuff in quantity
to actual military personnel.

27:26.561 --> 27:29.571
For civilians like yourself,
the sky's the limit.

27:30.999 --> 27:33.545
- And why is that?
- To keep us angry.

27:34.724 --> 27:37.097
If Marines could get what they need
when they need it,

27:37.217 --> 27:40.751
we would be happy, and we wouldn't be
ready to kill people all the time.

27:40.871 --> 27:43.229
See, the marine corps is like
America's little pit bull.

27:43.349 --> 27:44.857
They beat us, mistreat us,

27:44.977 --> 27:47.844
and once in a while let us out
to attack somebody.

27:50.374 --> 27:52.346
What's the big deal with the batteries?

27:52.466 --> 27:54.642
They're for our pec-twos and N.V.Gs,

27:55.350 --> 27:56.700
our night vision.

27:57.713 --> 28:00.341
Battalion didn't bring enough batteries.
We had to ration them.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.666
Battalion didn't bring
enough of anything that matters.

28:02.786 --> 28:04.477
They don't {even }have enough fuckin' maps.

28:04.597 --> 28:06.581
The army goes to war, they bring it all.

28:06.701 --> 28:07.939
But Marines...

28:08.446 --> 28:09.499
We make do.

28:10.591 --> 28:12.212
No maps, no batteries.

28:12.454 --> 28:15.372
We keep trying to get this shit
mailed to us but nothing ever comes.

28:15.709 --> 28:19.377
Fuck if Colbert didn't try and
have a shield for the turret Fedexed,

28:19.537 --> 28:21.643
not that it'll get here in time.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.731
Titanium, 16 Ibs.

28:27.035 --> 28:28.913
I had it custom engineered.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.541
{See, }When the Marines
invade a foreign country,

28:33.661 --> 28:35.607
we gotta buy all our own shit.

28:35.911 --> 28:39.229
Me and Brad spent $500 of our own money
just fixing up the Humvee...

28:39.787 --> 28:42.910
Bought our own antennas,
filters, cammie nets.

28:43.661 --> 28:45.676
We even painted it ourselves.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.474
So yeah, homes,

28:48.917 --> 28:50.021
we pimpin'.

28:54.697 --> 28:56.704
Why do you guys need the diapers?

29:03.503 --> 29:06.744
<i>Hitman two three, this is Hitman.
Radio check, over.</i>

29:18.653 --> 29:21.906
Brad, we have major activity
on the wire.

29:23.221 --> 29:26.152
2-0 unidentified victors
at the checkpoint.

29:28.843 --> 29:31.347
Fuck, they're coming through the gates!

29:36.277 --> 29:38.179
Un-fucking-believable.

29:38.559 --> 29:39.811
The shit is on.

29:40.152 --> 29:41.208
Has to be.

29:46.023 --> 29:48.506
- Pepperoni, motherfucker!
- This fucking rocks!

29:51.751 --> 29:53.387
Some beer would go great with this!

29:56.060 --> 29:57.849
Here, I'll trade you one.

29:58.010 --> 29:59.355
- Fuck yeah!
- $10 a pie?

29:59.475 --> 30:02.337
- No sir, I'm selling $10 per slice.
- The fuck you say?

30:02.457 --> 30:05.237
With kindness, sir, you go
to Kuwait City and get it yourself then.

30:05.357 --> 30:07.104
- Fucking ridiculous!
- You have $20?

30:07.224 --> 30:09.273
Can you believe
they're like 10 bucks a slice?

30:09.393 --> 30:11.892
- I need a 20!
- You haji motherfucker!

30:15.150 --> 30:16.535
Choke, motherfucker!

30:16.737 --> 30:19.252
I'm three for 20.
I'm hornier than a motherfucker!

30:19.372 --> 30:23.371
Just when I thought I'd stopped loving
the marine corps they go and do this.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.781
This is it, Dawg.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.922
The corps doesn't just bring pizza pies
from Kuwait City for no reason.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.452
We got lobster in Afghanistan.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.462
Captain, sir?

30:38.369 --> 30:39.913
Did you guys get some pizza?

30:40.033 --> 30:41.521
You can have my extra slice.

30:41.641 --> 30:43.566
The other companies have bumped
into high gear.

30:43.686 --> 30:47.136
They're stowing their gear,
packing the Humvees. What's up?

30:48.008 --> 30:49.411
What do you mean?

30:49.926 --> 30:53.149
Sir, is there a reason
we got pizza delivered today?

30:59.272 --> 31:02.119
Godfather issued maps
for your team leaders,

31:02.459 --> 31:04.249
the whole A-O to the Euphrates.

31:04.702 --> 31:07.696
I was gonna bring it up
at our briefing tomorrow.

31:13.035 --> 31:15.844
Godfather says General Mattis
issued the warning order.

31:16.416 --> 31:20.402
So be prepared to move to the staging
area within the next 48 hours.

31:23.854 --> 31:25.812
Nice of him to fucking mention it.

31:25.973 --> 31:26.999
Get some!

31:28.527 --> 31:29.588
Let's roll!

31:32.500 --> 31:35.576
- Shit, Dawg!
- I feel like it's fuckin' Christmas!

31:42.740 --> 31:45.332
It's urgent, Brad.
We're fuckin' almost Oscar Mike.

31:45.492 --> 31:46.255
Ray,

31:47.073 --> 31:49.404
can I have just one final moment

31:49.524 --> 31:51.811
enjoying the fruits of civilization?

32:05.804 --> 32:07.536
We are breaking open the M.O.P. suits.

32:07.656 --> 32:10.240
They are rated to maintain
their effectiveness against chemical

32:10.360 --> 32:12.400
and biological attack for 30 days.

32:12.743 --> 32:14.660
Now make sure they fit now.

32:15.021 --> 32:17.316
There will be no chance
to exchange them later.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.907
Do not wash, abrade,
or puncture your M.O.P. suit.

32:21.256 --> 32:24.622
- We expect to fight dirty.
- Been fighting dirty my whole life.

32:24.782 --> 32:27.749
If we are fighting in a chemical
environment and we get shot,

32:28.104 --> 32:29.607
how are they gonna cas-evac us{if we're dirty}?

32:29.727 --> 32:31.837
- They're not.
- What?

32:31.997 --> 32:35.464
You're hit in a chemical environment,
you're fucked anyway.

32:38.611 --> 32:40.095
Woodland camouflage?

32:40.399 --> 32:43.135
Anyone happen to remember we're invading
a fucking desert country?

32:43.255 --> 32:45.683
- Fuckin' retards.
- Exactly. What the fuck, man?

32:45.803 --> 32:47.204
Can't fight in this shit.

32:47.324 --> 32:49.061
I hate these fuckin' things.

32:50.564 --> 32:52.714
How come the reporter gets desert?

32:53.136 --> 32:55.139
- I didn't ask for...
- Are you wearing shorts?

32:55.259 --> 32:56.904
What? Boxers, screwby.

32:57.487 --> 32:59.072
Yo, it's gonna be hot, man.

32:59.925 --> 33:00.758
Me?

33:01.044 --> 33:03.146
Shit, I'm freeballing it
all the way to Baghdad.

33:03.266 --> 33:05.579
- Good thing I shaved my balls.
- Your President

33:07.134 --> 33:08.215
is watching!

33:10.922 --> 33:11.944
America

33:13.763 --> 33:14.891
is watching!

33:17.767 --> 33:19.253
But more important,

33:21.372 --> 33:22.557
Godfather

33:24.237 --> 33:25.293
is watching.

33:28.064 --> 33:29.426
Make no mistake,

33:30.995 --> 33:33.023
there will be no

33:33.705 --> 33:35.063
fuckups!

33:37.242 --> 33:38.298
Marines

33:39.815 --> 33:42.510
around this world would gives

33:43.741 --> 33:45.052
their left

33:45.373 --> 33:46.271
nuts

33:46.945 --> 33:48.218
to be

33:49.376 --> 33:50.669
where you are!

33:51.937 --> 33:55.128
- Anybody not want to go?
- No, Sergeant Major!

33:56.062 --> 33:57.273
Marines,

33:58.635 --> 33:59.986
kill on three!

34:01.136 --> 34:02.017
One!

34:02.851 --> 34:03.778
Two!

34:04.558 --> 34:06.655
- Three!
- Kill!

34:10.004 --> 34:11.859
Batal-lion,

34:13.914 --> 34:15.887
atten...

34:16.605 --> 34:17.359
tion!

34:20.536 --> 34:21.514
Dismissed!

34:25.847 --> 34:26.880
Get some!

34:42.161 --> 34:43.065
<i>Hitman three,</i>

34:43.186 --> 34:46.585
<i>can you have your R.T.O. head over
here to Hitman? Over.</i>

34:46.706 --> 34:48.418
Anybody need any water?

34:54.018 --> 34:55.914
Sergeant, are we there yet?

34:56.873 --> 34:59.363
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman three.
He's en route.</i>

34:59.483 --> 35:01.230
What the fuck is taking so long?

35:01.350 --> 35:04.236
We've been sitting here
for four goddamn hours.

35:21.010 --> 35:23.710
- Don't spit on my Humvee, Ray.
- I didn't.

35:25.631 --> 35:26.501
Ray,

35:26.621 --> 35:30.182
you spit with your lips, you always
get it on the side of my Humvee.

35:30.804 --> 35:32.906
I heard you spit with your lips.

35:33.470 --> 35:34.770
Spit with your teeth{, Ray}.

35:37.098 --> 35:39.432
<i>All Hitman victors, still waiting.</i>

35:39.843 --> 35:43.017
Be advised we're still waiting
for the battalion translator.

35:45.830 --> 35:49.192
Do you mean you guys are invading Iraq
with just one translator?

36:00.585 --> 36:01.485
No, shit.

36:01.605 --> 36:02.728
What is it?

36:05.843 --> 36:07.780
Dude man, this majorly sucks!

36:08.561 --> 36:10.471
Sir, we can not delay any longer.

36:13.792 --> 36:16.061
I can't believe I'm leaving
without my shit, man.

36:17.764 --> 36:18.929
It's primo chronic.

36:19.049 --> 36:21.357
- It's the best in the gulf!
- That's regrettable, Sir.

36:21.518 --> 36:23.404
- Bullshit!
- Let's go, mount up!

36:23.524 --> 36:25.534
- Interpreter is stowed.
- We are Oscar Mike!

36:25.654 --> 36:28.365
We are Oscar Mike to
the border staging area.

36:28.974 --> 36:30.137
Two two's up!

36:31.280 --> 36:32.383
War scribe,

36:32.861 --> 36:33.787
want some dip?

36:35.503 --> 36:38.653
First couple of times I dipped,
I puked a little bit.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.713
But as long as you don't get it.
In Brad's Humvee,

36:43.502 --> 36:44.669
we won't mind.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.868
<i>- All Hitman Victors...
- It's good, isn't it?</i>

36:55.988 --> 36:59.988
<i>...maintain 50 meter
dispersion at 2-5 kph, over.</i>

37:00.359 --> 37:01.566
<i>Roger that.</i>

37:03.566 --> 37:06.010
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
we are Oscar Mike.</i>

37:06.130 --> 37:08.704
<i>Maintain 50 meter dispersion at 45 kph.</i>

37:08.824 --> 37:10.274
Check it out, Dawg.

37:10.776 --> 37:12.532
White man won't be denied.

37:55.826 --> 37:58.072
<i>...cruise missiles fired by US Ships</i>

37:58.192 --> 38:00.639
<i>and guided bombs dropped
by stealth planes</i>

38:00.759 --> 38:03.013
<i>struck targets in downtown Baghdad</i>

38:03.133 --> 38:04.962
<i>in what American officials describe</i>

38:05.123 --> 38:08.298
<i>as an attempt to decapitate
the Iraqi leadership</i>

38:08.458 --> 38:09.943
<i>before the war begins.</i>

38:10.219 --> 38:13.339
<i>Meanwhile, a quarter of a million
American and British-led troops</i>

38:13.459 --> 38:16.012
<i>are said to be massed
on the Iraq-Kuwait border</i>

38:16.132 --> 38:18.809
<i>amid claims that many Iraqi soldiers</i>

38:18.969 --> 38:20.419
<i>are ready to defect.</i>

38:20.918 --> 38:24.215
<i>In the States, the US Secretary
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld</i>

38:24.335 --> 38:28.156
<i>has denied reports that negotiations
are taking place for a cease fire.</i>

38:28.541 --> 38:31.113
<i>He said the only topic
for discussion with Saddam Hussein</i>

38:31.661 --> 38:34.408
<i>- was unconditional surrender...
- We kicked the hornet's nest.</i>

38:36.067 --> 38:37.911
Now we better kill
all the fucking hornets.

38:42.039 --> 38:43.834
You're being called upon to kill.

38:44.967 --> 38:48.117
We're gonna be invading
a country full of civilians.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.360
But at the same time,

38:50.480 --> 38:53.179
we don't know if the people shooting
at us are gonna be in uniform

38:53.299 --> 38:54.966
or looking like farmers.

38:55.635 --> 38:56.983
If we shoot civilians,

38:57.103 --> 38:59.579
we're gonna turn the populace
against us and lose this war.

38:59.699 --> 39:03.039
But I don't want to lose marines
because we are not aggressive.

39:03.159 --> 39:05.309
The R.O.E. will boil down to this:

39:06.433 --> 39:10.360
if in your mind you fire
to protect yourself or your team

39:11.183 --> 39:12.858
- it's the right thing.
- Hell yeah!

39:12.978 --> 39:14.140
Get that?

39:15.232 --> 39:16.943
I don't want
to shoot no fuckin' farmer.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.414
- {Shit, }I'd shoot one.
- Sir,

39:18.534 --> 39:20.398
you got any word
from the rest of the world?

39:20.518 --> 39:22.050
Is the U.N. going in with us,

39:22.170 --> 39:23.720
or are we on our own?

39:24.895 --> 39:27.793
It's the usual french
talk of stall and surrender.

39:27.954 --> 39:29.255
Gas gas gas!

39:30.165 --> 39:32.174
- Move move!
- Gas gas!

39:34.753 --> 39:36.389
- Gas gas gas!
- Move move move!

39:36.509 --> 39:37.964
Get to the vehicles!

39:44.187 --> 39:46.911
Let's go, let's take cover! Let's go!

39:47.557 --> 39:48.887
Move move move!

39:49.579 --> 39:51.735
Put a move on it! We gotta go!

39:51.895 --> 39:53.028
Get to the vehicles!

40:24.398 --> 40:26.159
What do you got, Sergeant?

40:32.878 --> 40:34.821
Can you help me with the...

40:53.288 --> 40:54.275
All clear!

40:55.918 --> 40:56.952
All clear!

41:01.715 --> 41:04.765
I just performed testicle
surgery on the reporter!

41:08.466 --> 41:11.726
I forgot to spit out my
tobacco so I had to swallow it.

41:12.830 --> 41:15.154
And this suit is too small.

41:16.633 --> 41:18.134
That strap was crushing my nuts.

41:18.254 --> 41:22.058
Reporter, you are possibly
the biggest fuckup I have encountered.

41:22.623 --> 41:24.494
Well maybe he fits right in.

41:44.843 --> 41:48.212
You know it doesn't make
you gay if you think Rudy's hot.

41:48.332 --> 41:49.838
We all think he's hot.

41:49.958 --> 41:51.369
Jesus, you're beautiful.

41:51.489 --> 41:53.300
Actually I'm going to hell out here.

41:53.420 --> 41:54.388
Back home,

41:54.834 --> 41:56.943
all I eat is sushi and vegetables.

41:57.103 --> 41:58.862
The nutrition here is garbage.

42:00.494 --> 42:03.298
You know, I think Sheree and
I are going to move to San Francisco.

42:03.418 --> 42:04.784
There's no fat people there.

42:04.945 --> 42:06.709
That was a no-shit scud attack, Gents.

42:06.829 --> 42:07.996
Awesome!

42:08.116 --> 42:10.462
I just lived through a scud attack.

42:10.742 --> 42:13.711
Rudy, why would you give a fuck
if there's fat people where you live?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.148
Brother, I want to live where
people care about themselves.

42:16.268 --> 42:17.747
Jesus Christ, Rudy.

42:18.673 --> 42:21.467
When are you gonna realize
that you're fucking gay?

42:22.816 --> 42:26.139
When we're on libo, you wear
banana republic Daisy Duke shorts

42:26.600 --> 42:27.962
and now you're rolling into battle

42:28.082 --> 42:30.727
in your goddamn chicken suit
and J-Lo glasses.

42:31.146 --> 42:32.492
You dress like a pimp queen.

42:32.612 --> 42:35.235
I don't dress like
no goddamn pimp queen.

42:35.526 --> 42:37.978
I wear clothes that are body-conscious.

42:40.661 --> 42:41.902
Gas gas gas!

42:45.111 --> 42:46.534
Move move move!

42:53.588 --> 42:55.819
- Good job, reporter.
- I got it!

42:57.330 --> 43:00.186
Air and Arty are
now hitting Safwan Hill.

43:01.004 --> 43:04.654
There are two Iraqi divisions
on the other side of the breach.

43:05.929 --> 43:09.111
From the sound of it,
they are not having a good day.

43:09.580 --> 43:13.121
We are going to demonstrate
to the Iraqis that we have not come

43:13.241 --> 43:16.491
to harm innocent people
or threaten their way of life.

43:16.731 --> 43:20.699
But if you bump into an Iraqi who wants
to fight, you will fucking kick his ass.

43:22.670 --> 43:24.435
Battle streamers for this battalion

43:24.555 --> 43:26.897
will be earned on your shoulders,

43:27.130 --> 43:28.649
on your shoulders.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.426
Now, gentlemen,

43:31.546 --> 43:34.885
all mustaches grown
for the divisional contest

43:35.005 --> 43:36.811
are all to be shaved

43:37.195 --> 43:39.129
by the time we reach the Euphrates.

43:40.626 --> 43:43.576
This battalion will maintain
a grooming standard.

43:45.216 --> 43:46.766
That's all, gentlemen.

43:50.031 --> 43:54.014
We're getting ready to invade a country
and this is what our leader offers us.

43:54.134 --> 43:55.215
Mustaches.

43:55.335 --> 43:58.480
I trust you, Brad, to keep
your personal feelings to yourself.

44:01.409 --> 44:02.592
Check it out.

44:02.944 --> 44:04.066
I taped my windows

44:04.186 --> 44:07.836
so I can turn my laptop on without
the enemy seeing the light.

44:08.169 --> 44:09.013
Cool?

44:11.427 --> 44:14.592
How do you feel on the
edge of this historical invasion?

44:14.825 --> 44:18.175
Find those batteries yet
for my night vision gear, Gunny?

44:18.752 --> 44:20.687
That was a goddamn sucker punch.

44:20.807 --> 44:23.090
Supply situation isn't on any of us.

44:23.210 --> 44:25.782
With all due respect, Gunny,
last I checked, your billet

44:25.902 --> 44:29.724
was ops chief in charge of procuring
supplies necessary for combat readiness.

44:29.844 --> 44:31.318
Yeah, and I inherited that mess

44:31.438 --> 44:35.028
from some pog who fucked
it all up before I even got near it.

44:37.347 --> 44:39.023
- You get word on the escort?
- A week.

44:39.143 --> 44:40.836
Gave me a {ucking }week to unfuck this shit.

44:40.956 --> 44:41.806
Captain?

44:42.153 --> 44:44.016
Are we getting tanks or cobras?

44:44.873 --> 44:46.634
What's up with the escort?

44:46.941 --> 44:48.939
We got word a couple of hours ago.

44:49.149 --> 44:52.541
We're not getting escort tanks
or cobras going over the border.

44:52.661 --> 44:55.811
Any reason you waited
till now to tell me about this?

45:03.229 --> 45:06.603
We've lost our armor escort.
And we get no ass going over the L.O.D.

45:06.723 --> 45:09.504
- That's a low priority to pass on?
- Personal feelings, sir.

45:09.624 --> 45:12.174
They're sending us
alone against Iraqi armor.

45:12.294 --> 45:14.677
People are gonna die because of this!

45:15.264 --> 45:17.366
See you on the other side, Bro.

45:19.503 --> 45:20.479
Godspeed!

45:21.264 --> 45:23.775
- God-fucking-speed to you!
- Fucking Captain America.

45:24.273 --> 45:27.623
- A little belt-fed today, isn't he?
- We're all excited.

45:33.289 --> 45:35.450
They kill hundreds, those pilots.

45:36.119 --> 45:39.119
I would liked to have flown the
plane that dropped the bomb on Japan.

45:39.239 --> 45:42.168
A couple of dudes killed
hundreds of thousands.

45:42.328 --> 45:43.377
That fucking rules.

45:58.526 --> 46:00.593
<i>All Hitman Victors,</i>

46:00.713 --> 46:04.223
<i>be advised we are five kliks out
from breach point 2. Over.</i>

46:09.342 --> 46:11.690
Man, I wish I had some 'shrooms.

46:12.424 --> 46:13.929
This is the fucking shit!

46:14.049 --> 46:15.910
Yeah, it's the shiznit.

46:16.850 --> 46:18.643
Watch the fucking road.

46:19.323 --> 46:20.856
How come we're not there yet?

46:20.976 --> 46:24.711
Maybe 'cause a certain severely retarded
company commander by the name

46:24.872 --> 46:27.714
of Encino man who,
in his infinite retardation,

46:28.441 --> 46:30.008
duct-taped his humvee windows.

46:30.472 --> 46:32.418
Thought he was being
all tactical and shit,

46:32.538 --> 46:35.597
until Bravo missed the turn at the
checkpoint 'cause retard couldn't see

46:35.758 --> 46:37.292
out his fuckin' truck.

46:39.291 --> 46:42.545
There's layers of retardation
that most people don't even know about.

46:42.665 --> 46:45.420
<i>- You should quote me on that.
- Two One, continue behind raptor.</i>

46:45.540 --> 46:47.358
<i>We'll be veering west to the 98 ***.</i>

46:47.519 --> 46:49.235
Roger that.
We still have *** point 2.

46:49.604 --> 46:53.417
Look at this shit. How come
we can't ever invade a cool country...

46:53.537 --> 46:55.609
like chicks in bikinis, you know?

46:55.729 --> 46:57.984
How come countries like
that don't ever need Marines?

46:58.104 --> 46:59.216
I'll tell you why.

46:59.336 --> 47:01.625
It's lack of pussy
that fucks countries up.

47:01.745 --> 47:05.643
Lack of pussy is the root fucking
cause of all global instability.

47:06.154 --> 47:08.045
If more hajis were
getting quality pussy,

47:08.206 --> 47:10.964
there'd be no reason for us to come
over here and fuck them up like this.

47:11.428 --> 47:14.043
'cause a nut-busted
haji is a happy haji.

47:17.092 --> 47:19.012
How much ripped fuel have you ingested?

47:19.132 --> 47:21.061
I'm on it like a motherfucker, Brad.

47:21.181 --> 47:22.527
I'm moto, dude!

47:23.323 --> 47:25.376
No more of that shit.

47:25.496 --> 47:27.347
When you do ripped fuel,
you can't shut up.

47:27.467 --> 47:29.360
<i>All Hitman Victors,</i>

47:29.480 --> 47:32.754
<i>be advised you
are three kliks south of breach point 2.</i>

47:33.827 --> 47:35.438
Interesting theory though.

47:35.558 --> 47:37.504
Yeah, you should quote me on it.

47:37.624 --> 47:39.702
You know what?
You should definitely quote me on it.

47:39.863 --> 47:42.330
This whole fucking thing,
it comes down to pussy.

47:42.862 --> 47:44.772
If you took the republican guard

47:44.892 --> 47:47.161
and comped their asses
in vegas for a weekend,

47:47.281 --> 47:48.477
no fucking war.

47:49.114 --> 47:52.238
So the war's not about oil or W.M.Ds?

47:52.358 --> 47:55.093
No. In the opinion of
this Marine it's about pussy.

47:56.137 --> 47:59.264
- And it's not about Saddam?
- Saddam's just part of the problem.

47:59.425 --> 48:01.140
If Saddam invested more

48:01.503 --> 48:04.978
in the pussy infrastructure of iraq
than he did on his fucking gayass army,

48:05.437 --> 48:09.136
than this country would be no more
fucked up than, say, Mexico.

48:12.083 --> 48:13.151
Please shut up.

48:16.933 --> 48:17.931
Thank you.

48:18.312 --> 48:21.369
<i>All hitman two victors,
we are one klik until breach 2.</i>

48:26.036 --> 48:27.469
Wake up, Trombley.

48:29.820 --> 48:31.170
You're missing the invasion.

48:58.814 --> 49:00.141
Yo, Christopher,

49:02.055 --> 49:04.760
get some of this on videotape
for me, Brah.

49:04.977 --> 49:07.560
This is us invading
a country right here.

49:10.554 --> 49:11.585
Oh, shit!

49:15.088 --> 49:16.757
Welcome to Iraq, bitches!

49:27.739 --> 49:31.189
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
we take this turn,</i>

49:32.048 --> 49:34.359
<i>we're screening west with
no adjacent support.</i>

49:34.520 --> 49:37.618
<i>Roger that. This is it.
We got no escort.</i>

49:37.738 --> 49:39.989
<i>It's just our thin-skinned
Humvees going against tanks.</i>

49:40.150 --> 49:43.326
Jesus, Captain America's
a fucking retard.

49:43.446 --> 49:46.719
They need to keep that
asshole off company-wide comms.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.615
Two One Alpha, this is Two One Bravo.

49:55.735 --> 49:59.679
<i>We have a possible rocket tube at our
two o'clock, 500 meters,</i>

49:59.799 --> 50:01.476
<i>that shiny thing. Over.</i>

50:02.858 --> 50:05.972
Put your mark-19 at two o'clock,
range at 500.

50:07.331 --> 50:09.043
I see a glinting, Sergeant.

50:09.163 --> 50:11.872
I can't tell if it's
a pipe or a tank tube.

50:12.432 --> 50:14.399
I glassed it. It's a pipe.

50:15.937 --> 50:17.816
Two One Bravo, this is Two One Alpha.

50:17.936 --> 50:20.251
We see a pipe in a trash pile. Over.

50:21.326 --> 50:22.920
This is Two One Bravo.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.200
Roger that. Out.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.096
Tell you who the biggest
fucking retard is:

50:27.216 --> 50:28.761
that Saddam Hussein.

50:29.408 --> 50:32.709
We already kicked his ass once, and
what does this retard go and fucking do?

50:33.282 --> 50:36.087
He spends the next 10
years pissing us off even more.

50:36.440 --> 50:38.081
We don't{ even} want
to be in this shithole.

50:38.201 --> 50:39.257
Stop scribbling.

50:40.612 --> 50:42.009
It encourages him.

50:47.341 --> 50:48.818
Stay frosty, Gents.

50:49.769 --> 50:50.989
What do you got?

50:51.109 --> 50:53.773
I just waved at an Iraqi
and he waved back.

50:54.489 --> 50:55.682
That was cool.

50:55.802 --> 50:58.192
Good, Garza. Be magnanimous.

50:58.802 --> 51:00.345
What the fuck does that mean?

51:00.465 --> 51:02.155
Lofty and kinglike.

51:02.536 --> 51:04.273
Buddy, it's 10:00 in the morning.

51:04.393 --> 51:07.160
Don't you think you oughta change out
of your pajamas?

51:17.269 --> 51:19.689
- Afternoon, sir.
- Beautiful day to get a war on.

51:19.809 --> 51:22.306
- I'll trade your pop-tarts.
- I got combos.

51:23.433 --> 51:24.596
I'll take 'em.

51:25.194 --> 51:28.162
- Sucker.
- Sir, is our mission still that bridge?

51:28.282 --> 51:30.137
All right, gents, listen up.

51:36.407 --> 51:37.436
We are here.

51:37.556 --> 51:41.530
Our orders, that we are to bust north
until the battalion tells us to stop.

51:41.650 --> 51:45.205
The bridge we're supposed
to be seizing in six hours is here.

51:45.747 --> 51:47.497
We've gone beyond the A-O.

51:48.110 --> 51:50.663
Is battalion {still }asking us to execute
our mission on the same timetable?

51:50.783 --> 51:53.164
- I have no word on that, brad.
- Anyone want a charms?

51:53.325 --> 51:54.975
What, are you an idiot?

51:55.095 --> 51:58.611
Never ever let charms
into this vehicle again.

51:58.731 --> 52:00.879
Nobody lets charms in the vehicle
in the whole fucking

52:00.999 --> 52:02.945
United States Marine corps.
It's bad luck.

52:03.065 --> 52:06.095
- Semper simple motherfucker.
- Fuckin' new guy!

52:07.487 --> 52:10.976
<i>We've been static way too long,
sitting here with our asses hanging out.</i>

52:11.258 --> 52:13.601
<i>We don't stand a chance
against one T-72 tank.</i>

52:14.416 --> 52:17.281
<i>They got 70 of them out here.
This is suicide!</i>

52:17.610 --> 52:19.875
Sir, the behavior
of your fellow officer,

52:19.995 --> 52:23.026
commander of our sister platoon,
is starting to concern us.

52:23.570 --> 52:25.143
Captain America's unprofessional.

52:25.263 --> 52:28.945
If you have a nickname for an Officer,
I don't want to know it.

52:29.065 --> 52:31.149
Is everyone on your
teams getting some shut-eye?

52:31.269 --> 52:34.247
Since they brought us pizza at Mathilda,
my whole team hasn't slept.

52:34.895 --> 52:37.763
- That's, what, 30 hours now?
- We don't know what's coming.

52:37.883 --> 52:39.762
You gotta rotate guys,
get 'em some sleep.

53:40.805 --> 53:44.233
When my band opened up for Limp Bizkit
in Kansas City, we fuckin' sucked.

53:45.394 --> 53:46.698
But then again, so did they.

53:46.818 --> 53:50.156
The only difference is that they
became famous and I became a marine.

53:50.316 --> 53:52.241
Hey, there's kids holding hands.

53:54.612 --> 53:55.434
Cute.

53:56.571 --> 53:58.250
Don't shoot 'em, Garza.

54:08.647 --> 54:11.218
- We got hardball ahead, Sergeant.
- That's M.S.R. Tampa.

54:12.553 --> 54:15.799
When we've crossed it,
we'll be the northernmost unit in Iraq.

54:17.813 --> 54:19.222
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

54:19.342 --> 54:21.082
Do you want my victor
to provide overwatch

54:21.202 --> 54:23.022
on the northeast corner of the M.S.R?

54:23.469 --> 54:24.491
<i>Roger that.</i>

54:24.992 --> 54:27.610
<i>This is Hitman Two.
All Hitman Victors align off Two One.</i>

54:47.101 --> 54:49.570
I got two pickups bearing down
on us fast.

54:52.020 --> 54:55.727
Sir, I observe men with A.K.S.
They're in the lead vehicle.

54:55.847 --> 54:58.972
Hitman, this is Hitman Two. We have two
victors with armed Iraqis approaching.

54:59.092 --> 55:00.191
How copy?

55:01.929 --> 55:03.229
<i>Hitman, solid copy.</i>

55:03.596 --> 55:05.231
Hitman, I am seeing armed Iraqis

55:05.391 --> 55:08.195
in civilian clothes in white pickups
marked with red diamonds.

55:08.315 --> 55:09.603
We should smoke 'em, sir!

55:09.723 --> 55:11.919
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman.
Interrogative.</i>

55:12.039 --> 55:13.115
<i>Can you...</i>

55:13.355 --> 55:15.861
<i>- Can you wave them off? Over.
- Hitman, this is Two.</i>

55:15.981 --> 55:19.768
These are armed Iraqis in marked Victors
with weapons pointed at us. Over.

55:20.124 --> 55:22.579
<i>R.O.E. States uniformed soldiers only,</i>

55:23.208 --> 55:25.123
<i>and they should be firing at us.</i>

55:25.754 --> 55:28.462
This is Two. I'm requesting
to at least snatch one victor,

55:28.622 --> 55:30.627
find out who these guys are. Over.

55:30.747 --> 55:32.264
<i>Negative. Wave 'em off.</i>

55:32.553 --> 55:33.579
<i>Hitman out.</i>

55:42.427 --> 55:43.968
- This sucks!
- What the fuck?

55:44.088 --> 55:45.438
I had a beautiful head shot.

55:45.598 --> 55:46.995
We all did, brother.

55:57.633 --> 55:58.980
Are you kidding me?

55:59.570 --> 56:03.348
- What the fuck was that?
- Our first contact with armed Iraqis

56:04.107 --> 56:05.833
and we wave at 'em like bitches.

56:10.737 --> 56:13.526
You know what happens
when you get out of the Marine Corps?

56:13.785 --> 56:15.406
You get your brains back.

56:17.417 --> 56:19.063
<i>...India of course chasing</i>

56:19.183 --> 56:21.748
<i>that massive Australian total of 359,</i>

56:21.988 --> 56:25.813
<i>already one wicket down
with just an overcome at...</i>

56:25.993 --> 56:27.981
Company Commanders are here, sir.

56:35.566 --> 56:37.223
Drop your pots, gentlemen.

56:37.790 --> 56:40.200
I don't know if it's me
or these new liners, but something

56:40.320 --> 56:41.744
in my kevlar fuckin' stinks.

56:48.882 --> 56:51.455
We're 14 hours
since crossing the L.O.D.

56:52.268 --> 56:53.881
We've moved 70 Kliks north.

56:55.167 --> 56:56.327
We, gentlemen,

56:56.544 --> 56:58.544
are the northernmost unit in Iraq.

57:00.118 --> 57:03.393
Our job now is to screen
the northern flank of one M.E.F.

57:04.301 --> 57:07.225
You got any WO on our mission, sir?
We still doing the bridge assault?

57:07.435 --> 57:08.419
No word.

57:08.836 --> 57:11.125
But judging
by where they've placed us,

57:11.537 --> 57:13.692
higher-ups have deemed
that mission irrelevant.

57:14.179 --> 57:15.232
Even so,

57:16.086 --> 57:17.863
what's foremost
in godfather's mind...

57:19.557 --> 57:21.953
we're still very much
in the game, gentlemen,

57:22.209 --> 57:23.693
very much in the game.

57:24.772 --> 57:26.413
Okay, that's all for now.

57:34.579 --> 57:35.822
Colonel Ferrando,

57:36.889 --> 57:38.804
if I can ask, why does your...

57:39.381 --> 57:40.683
voice sound that way?

57:41.136 --> 57:42.314
Throat cancer.

57:44.720 --> 57:45.799
You a smoker?

57:48.555 --> 57:49.964
Just lucky, I guess.

58:05.179 --> 58:07.364
Why the fuck
are you throwing food around?

58:07.484 --> 58:09.118
I'm gonna shoot me a dog.

58:11.551 --> 58:13.219
No you're not, Trombley.

58:13.898 --> 58:15.962
No one's shooting any dogs in Iraq.

58:20.113 --> 58:21.182
I got seven.

58:22.749 --> 58:23.947
You got seven?

58:26.047 --> 58:27.474
Yes, Sergeant, I see seven.

58:32.587 --> 58:34.402
You seeing all these Iraqis?

58:36.097 --> 58:37.787
We've encountered over 60.

58:39.147 --> 58:41.322
See how they're walking
all jacked-up,

58:41.982 --> 58:43.095
sore-footed?

58:44.404 --> 58:46.070
At the rate this is going,

58:46.190 --> 58:49.943
this whole goddamn war will be over
without us firing a goddamn shot.

58:56.274 --> 58:57.957
- Shut up.
- Sit down.

59:04.881 --> 59:05.963
Guy's clean.

59:07.672 --> 59:10.147
Mister, mister,
my... my water... drink.

59:10.267 --> 59:11.450
Please, mister.

59:11.952 --> 59:12.779
Brad.

59:23.437 --> 59:25.475
Prison rules, Dawg, just like L.A.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.582
They are just civilians
fleeing Basra.

59:41.831 --> 59:44.616
They are grateful to be liberated
by the Americans.

59:47.756 --> 59:51.046
What manner of belt does
this gentleman appear to have donned?

59:56.215 --> 59:57.841
Military issue, Dawg.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.079
Sir, this is Republican Guard.

01:00:18.245 --> 01:00:19.301
Sergeant,

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:22.499
somebody down the line
already gave these guys M.R.E.S.

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:29.837
It's good!

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:31.140
Shut up! Sit down!

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.516
Shut the fuck up!

01:00:37.099 --> 01:00:39.650
This is the shit psy-ops dropped
on Iraqi Forces,

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.401
promising safe passage
to {ny }who surrender to {	he }Americans.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:51.577
He says 30 km east of here
on a bridge by the canal,

01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:53.654
there are Iraqi military
death squads

01:00:53.774 --> 01:00:56.293
that are executing Iraqi soldiers
who flee.

01:00:58.827 --> 01:01:01.128
The death squad dudes
are in white SUVs

01:01:01.506 --> 01:01:04.537
with red diamonds on them.
They are Fedayeen.

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:06.993
They are loyal to Saddam.

01:01:08.673 --> 01:01:10.213
These guys can't walk.

01:01:11.025 --> 01:01:12.639
<i>Three Two actual, this is Three Two.</i>

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:15.001
<i>Be advised,
Alpha {just }got hit by arty. Over.</i>

01:01:15.121 --> 01:01:16.193
Did you copy?

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.937
Alpha {just }had artillery hits
near their position.

01:01:19.097 --> 01:01:21.815
Get someone on the com.
We need at least 347 tons up here.

01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:27.071
Shoot that dog, Corporal!

01:01:28.248 --> 01:01:28.957
Sir,

01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:31.338
{shouldn't we be saving our rounds for enemy combatants?}
we should save our rounds for the enemy.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.020
Shoot that fucking dog!

01:01:34.366 --> 01:01:35.388
Darnold,

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.850
give it a piece of your jerky.

01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:46.476
Stike, give me some water
from the Humvee.

01:01:46.596 --> 01:01:47.668
Turn around.

01:01:49.093 --> 01:01:51.178
No, I don't want
your fucking cigarette.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.567
That the same hand he uses
to wipe his ass?

01:01:57.445 --> 01:01:59.764
I ain't touching no filthy Haji gum
that's been touched

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.954
by those filthy brown Haji fingers.

01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:04.685
Brah, these are people.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:05.609
Good?{ Good?}

01:02:08.538 --> 01:02:09.956
Oh yeah, very good.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:12.039
{Yeah, }I'd stick my cock through
that veil hole

01:02:12.159 --> 01:02:14.868
and fuck the shit out
of your wife's face any day.

01:02:18.304 --> 01:02:19.434
Oh, my God.

01:02:21.752 --> 01:02:22.626
Check it out!

01:02:23.186 --> 01:02:24.670
They got their own Fruity Rudy.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:30.682
We captured a fucking gay Iraqi!

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:32.786
Yo, hold that turd-pusher up.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.978
For shizzle, a gayass haji.

01:02:38.658 --> 01:02:40.310
Danger close, 12:00. It's godfather.

01:02:47.786 --> 01:02:49.611
Meesh, take him over there.
Sergeant.

01:02:52.048 --> 01:02:53.958
Alpha took three artillery hits.

01:02:54.078 --> 01:02:55.617
Somebody has an idea we're here.

01:02:55.986 --> 01:02:59.029
We've got four hours of daylight
to make it to our next position.

01:02:59.149 --> 01:03:01.074
We're not gonna deal
with these surrenders.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.642
That's from division.

01:03:02.961 --> 01:03:04.833
Send them all back the way they came.

01:03:04.953 --> 01:03:05.984
Roger that, sir.

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.176
We have orders, Nate.

01:03:15.923 --> 01:03:17.610
Are they fuckin' serious?

01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:19.664
Send them back where?

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:21.827
What, the fucking death squads?

01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:24.861
Sir, under articles 13 and 20
of the Geneva convention,

01:03:24.981 --> 01:03:26.731
we're obligated to take care of

01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:29.038
and protect
any fuckers who surrender to us.

01:03:29.158 --> 01:03:31.862
Division has ordered us
to unsurrender these Iraqis.

01:03:38.174 --> 01:03:39.620
Write this as you see it.

01:03:39.968 --> 01:03:41.602
I'm not here to stop you.

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.083
The Iraqis'
first contact with Americans.

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.008
We fuck 'em.

01:03:50.955 --> 01:03:52.496
Bravo Two, listen up!

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:54.292
Get ready to push!

01:03:54.568 --> 01:03:56.150
<i>- Let's go, gents!
- Mount up, boys!</i>

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:58.008
<i>- Mount up!
- Let's go!</i>

01:04:02.728 --> 01:04:03.785
Forget it!

01:04:23.991 --> 01:04:25.233
<i>We're Oscar Mike.</i>

01:04:25.805 --> 01:04:28.053
Turn it over, Ray. We're Oscar Mike.
