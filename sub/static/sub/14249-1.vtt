WEBVTT

00:07.474 --> 00:08.498
Rust?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.270
That's right, Captain.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.540
High levels of ferric oxide--
corroded iron particles.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.547
Would you mind telling me

00:15.615 --> 00:18.550
how iron could rust in space
without oxygen?

00:18.618 --> 00:19.846
l wish l could.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.910
Mr. Paris,

00:21.988 --> 00:24.388
alter our course to follow
that trail of rust.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.583
One-quarter impulse.

00:25.658 --> 00:27.091
Aye, Captain.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.035
Captain, look at this.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.901
l'm picking up traces
of complex hydrocarbons

00:39.973 --> 00:44.307
in the rust-- benzene,
ethylene, acetylene...

00:44.377 --> 00:45.969
That sounds like gasoline.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.138
Gasoline?

00:47.213 --> 00:50.046
lt's a liquid fuel that was used
centuries ago on Earth.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.048
They burned it

00:51.151 --> 00:53.176
to drive internal
combustion engines.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.777
How did it get out here?

00:54.854 --> 00:56.481
l'm detecting a small object.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.614
lt appears to be

00:57.690 --> 00:59.248
the source of the rust
and hydrocarbons.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.088
Put it on screen.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.855
Magnify.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.143 --> 02:58.633
Apparently, it is
a ground vehicle

02:58.711 --> 03:00.201
from mid-20th-century Earth.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.614
Whew!
lt's a 1936 Ford, actually.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.083
Mr. Paris?

03:06.152 --> 03:09.485
That was the manufacturing date:
1936.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.116
Ford was the name
of the company that built it.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.092
Antique vehicles
are a hobby of mine.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.700
lnternal combustion engine,

03:23.770 --> 03:25.397
a reciprocating
piston cylinder design.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.939
Fuel source was
a refined petroleum.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.302
Gasoline.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.673
So, is this an early hover car?

03:31.744 --> 03:34.770
No, you're about a century
too early for that.

03:34.847 --> 03:38.908
This is about one step ahead
of the horse-drawn carriage.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.819
Traces of potassium nitrate,
ammonium and methane back here.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.585
l think you'll find
that's manure.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.858
Horse manure,
if l'm not mistaken.

03:49.929 --> 03:53.262
Judging from the mud
on the wheels

03:53.333 --> 03:56.564
and the alfalfa seedlings
stuck in the metal frame,

03:56.636 --> 03:59.127
l'd say this vehicle
belonged to a farmer,

03:59.205 --> 04:01.730
or, at least, someone
who lived in a rural area.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.709
But the question is:
How did it get here?

04:04.777 --> 04:06.904
l doubt there are
many 20th-century farmers

04:07.013 --> 04:08.640
driving around
the Delta Quadrant.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.683
There are no signs
of any wormholes

04:10.750 --> 04:12.775
or temporal anomalies
in this region of space.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.844
Let's run a metallurgical
analysis of the vehicle.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.421
There's still oil
in the crankcase,

04:19.492 --> 04:21.619
water in the radiator.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.889
l wonder if the battery's
still charged.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.524
Now, let's see.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.568
This is before
voice-command activation,

04:29.636 --> 04:33.572
so there should be something
in here called a key.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.971
Key...

04:35.074 --> 04:36.701
What are you doing?

04:36.776 --> 04:39.609
Trying to bring this beauty
back to life.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.647
Now, where are the keys?

04:41.714 --> 04:44.148
Aha! Here they are.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.981
Okay, choke out,

04:47.086 --> 04:48.986
clutch in,

04:49.088 --> 04:50.988
give her a little gas,

04:51.090 --> 04:53.581
turn the key,

04:53.660 --> 04:55.355
and step on the starter.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.101
Sorry.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.809
Next time...

05:13.880 --> 05:17.577
you might give us
a little warning, Mr. Paris.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.049
Aye, Captain.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.787
l suggest we increase
the ventilation in the cargo bay

05:23.856 --> 05:25.346
before we are asphyxiated.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.154
What's that?

05:27.226 --> 05:31.162
That is an amplitude modulation
receiving device.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.664
AM radio.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.224
l'm not sure we'll
pick up much out here.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.839
Whoa. What was that?

05:45.645 --> 05:46.907
What is that?

05:46.979 --> 05:49.243
lt's too regular
to be random interference.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.909
l'm running the signal
through the ship's database.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.952
lt's an ancient Earth
distress call known as an SOS.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.052
l've located the source
of the SOS signal.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.756
lt's coming from a planet
in a star system

06:04.831 --> 06:07.197
bearing 310 mark 215.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.291
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.336
Aye, Captain.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.337
Why didn't we pick up
this signal earlier?

06:12.405 --> 06:14.805
This isn't one of the standard
frequencies we monitor.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.809
Messages on this channel only
travel at the speed of light--

06:17.877 --> 06:19.902
too slow for interstellar
communications.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.243
Course laid in, Captain.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.646
Warp 6.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.910
Engage.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.350
l'll run
a diagnostic check, sir.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.687
Mm-hmm.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.258
Bring us out of warp.
Full scan, Mr. Kim.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.300
The SOS signal is coming
from the third planet.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.892
lt's Class-L--
oxygen-argon atmosphere.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.699
Any life signs?

06:45.772 --> 06:47.933
There's a great deal
of trinimbic interference

06:48.074 --> 06:49.268
in the upper atmosphere.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.242
l can't get a clear reading
of the surface.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.608
Can you pinpoint the coordinates
of the distress call?

06:53.679 --> 06:54.839
Yes, here it is.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.280
lt's coming from a continent
in the northern hemisphere.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.647
We won't be able to transport

06:58.718 --> 07:00.151
through this kind
of interference.

07:00.219 --> 07:02.687
l might be able to take
an away team in a shuttlecraft.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.188
That would not be wise,
Commander,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.487
as the atmosphere is charged
with trinimbic turbulence.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.719
A shuttlecraft

07:07.794 --> 07:10.627
could not safely
navigate the currents.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.164
We could land the ship.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.632
Are you sure that's necessary?

07:17.703 --> 07:20.672
Someone on this planet
is sending out a distress call.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.265
lf that someone is as old
as the truck in the cargo bay,

07:23.342 --> 07:24.536
they're long-dead by now.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.578
This might be
an automated distress call.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.273
Possibly.

07:28.347 --> 07:31.578
But something brought that truck
halfway across the galaxy

07:31.651 --> 07:34.245
and that something
might be down on that planet.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.912
And if it brought
the truck here,

07:35.988 --> 07:37.683
it might be able
to take us home, too.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.726
l'd say it's worth a look.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.887
Mr. Paris, prepare the ship
for landing.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.929
Captain,
l think l should tell you

07:47.033 --> 07:50.696
l've never actually landed
a starship before.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.466
That's all right, Lieutenant,
neither have l.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.098
Bridge to Engineering.

07:56.175 --> 07:57.733
We're going to land the ship,
Ms. Torres.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.209
Take the warp core off-line,

07:59.278 --> 08:01.075
vent all plasma
from the nacelles,

08:01.147 --> 08:03.115
and stand by to engage
atmospheric thrusters.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.114
Aye, Captain.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.016
This is Lieutenant Tuvok
to all decks.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.485
We are preparing
to land the ship.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.079
Go to Blue Alert and report
to Code Blue stations.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.125
l've plotted a descent course.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.626
How close do you want to land
to the distress coordinates?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.322
No closer than two kilometers.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.954
Okay.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.431
Atmospheric controls at standby.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.526
Landing mechanisms on line.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.503
lnertial dampers at maximum.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.903
All decks report
Condition Blue, Captain.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.938
Put her down, Mr. Paris.

08:44.557 --> 08:45.649
Status.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.818
We're on the glide trajectory.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.260
Altitude-- 100 kilometers.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.923
Speed-- 10,000 kph.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.435
Encountering some trinimbic
turbulence. Compensating.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.670
We have an EM discharge
in the lateral relays.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.739
l'm rerouting the ODN conduit.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.306
Another EM discharge.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.852
l think we're all right, though.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.046
20 kilometers
to the landing site.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.885
We should be able to see it now.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.855
Extend landing struts.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.862
Prepare to release
inertial dampers

09:23.930 --> 09:26.421
and adjust them to match
the planet's gravity.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.267
Landing struts down and locked.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.569
Standing by
environmental controls.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.939
Here we go.

09:47.553 --> 09:51.546
Disengaging engines,
securing thruster exhaust.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.760
We're down.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.558
Not bad... for a beginner.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.607
Nice day.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.108
l've locked on
to the distress signal.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.442
lt's 1.5 kilometers
on a bearing of 246.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.447
Wait a second.
l've got something else.

10:16.515 --> 10:19.382
There's a high concentration
of trianium particles,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.977
bearing 225-- a little
over a kilometer away.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.453
Looks like
some kind of power source.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.853
Two teams.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.757
Chakotay, yours investigates
the power source.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.988
Tuvok, Kim, you're with me.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.331
My God.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.526
The metal
is an aluminum alloy.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.224
lt appears to be
an ancient Earth aircraft.

11:06.298 --> 11:09.131
The SOS call
is coming from inside.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.217
l've found the AM transmitter.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.616
From what l can tell,

11:27.687 --> 11:29.678
it's sending out
an automated SOS.

11:29.755 --> 11:30.722
What about the power source?

11:30.790 --> 11:31.984
Somehow l find it
hard to believe

11:32.058 --> 11:35.186
the battery on this aircraft
has been running for 400 years.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.320
l don't recognize
the power signature.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.928
Hold on, Captain.

11:43.002 --> 11:47.905
l found what appears to be
an alien fusion-based generator.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.771
lt's hooked up
to the AM transmitter.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.674
Chakotay to Janeway.

11:54.814 --> 11:55.872
Go ahead, Commander.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.712
We've located the source
of the trianium readings.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.376
lt appears to be
some sort of mine shaft.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.512
l'd like to bring out
another security detachment

12:02.588 --> 12:03.782
before we go inside.

12:03.856 --> 12:04.880
Good idea.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.618
l'll join you.
Janeway out.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.024
l want the two of you
to analyze the alien generator,

12:09.095 --> 12:11.757
then see what you can find out
about this SOS call.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.807
l'm picking up something
directly ahead.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.869
Some kind of power signature.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.278
Fusion-based.

12:52.371 --> 12:56.034
This looks like some kind
of cryostasis chamber.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.110
How many bodies are there?

12:58.177 --> 12:59.474
Eight.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.639
And the equipment
is still functioning.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.660
He's human.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.733
And from the clothes,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.567
l'd say he's from the same era
as the vehicle we found.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.663
His life sign readings
are minimal,

13:27.740 --> 13:30.641
but... he's alive.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.709
Captain, according
to these readings,

13:36.782 --> 13:40.183
there are five other
cryostasis chambers nearby.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.311
No life signs in any of them.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.414
This appears to be the only one
with people inside.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.619
There's another male over here.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.226
This one's a female.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.965
She's wearing
some sort of leather jacket.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.906
And a pair of gold wings.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.136
Wait.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.076
There's a name tag here.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.706
l think it's ''A, period...

14:09.782 --> 14:11.909
''E-a...

14:11.984 --> 14:17.012
r-h-a-r-t.''

14:17.089 --> 14:18.750
''Earhart.''

14:20.459 --> 14:24.725
A.... Earhart.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.429
Amelia Earhart.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.864
Who's Amelia Earhart?

14:34.940 --> 14:38.376
She was one of the first
female pilots in Earth history.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.571
ln the mid-20th century,
she became quite famous

14:40.646 --> 14:42.671
for flying across
the Atlantic Ocean.

14:42.748 --> 14:47.481
ln 1937, she attempted to fly
around the world.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.751
According to the records
of the time, on July, 2, 1937,

14:51.824 --> 14:54.088
Earhart and her navigator,
Fred Noonan,

14:54.159 --> 14:56.593
took off from New Guinea,
and they were headed east

14:56.662 --> 14:58.926
around the equator.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.092
But somewhere in the South Seas,
they vanished,

15:02.167 --> 15:03.657
and their disappearance
became one of the most

15:03.736 --> 15:05.829
celebrated mysteries
of the 20th century.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.770
Why didn't they think
she'd just crashed?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.865
That was the most
commonly held theory.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.273
However, numerous
searches of the area

15:12.344 --> 15:14.073
failed to produce the wreckage
of an aircraft,

15:14.146 --> 15:16.273
so people began to speculate.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.179
Some thought she'd been
shot down and captured

15:18.250 --> 15:19.581
by the Japanese navy.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.779
Others thought that she and
Noonan had flown off together

15:21.854 --> 15:23.913
on some sort
of romantic adventure.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.584
Of course,
the most ridiculed notion was

15:27.660 --> 15:29.719
that she had been...

15:29.795 --> 15:31.763
abducted by aliens.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.424
Well, it certainly looks
like that's what happened.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.489
From what we can tell,

15:35.567 --> 15:37.501
all eight of the people
in that stasis chamber

15:37.569 --> 15:40.163
were taken from Earth
in the 1930s and brought here.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.706
The question is: Why?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.708
And where are the aliens
who did this?

15:43.776 --> 15:46.301
Scans of the region
show no alien life signs.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.743
Continue the scans.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.178
They may not be here now,

15:49.248 --> 15:52.945
but once they detect
our presence, they might return.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.543
ln the meantime, we'll have
to get some answers on our own.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.918
Have you had any luck
tapping into

15:56.989 --> 15:58.354
the computer system
in the cryo-chamber?

15:58.424 --> 15:59.914
Not as of yet.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.155
We are having difficulty
decoding the operating system.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.628
There's one way
we could find out what happened.

16:05.664 --> 16:08.292
We could wake those people up
and ask them.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.562
l've had
the same thought myself.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.103
ls that wise?

16:12.171 --> 16:13.229
We don't know how these people

16:13.305 --> 16:14.670
are going to react
when they wake up

16:14.740 --> 16:17.436
in an alien world
in the 24th century.

16:17.509 --> 16:18.703
True, but l'm not willing

16:18.777 --> 16:22.042
to just leave them in stasis
for another 400 years.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.378
And if we can find out
how they were brought here,

16:24.450 --> 16:27.578
we might be able
to use that method to get home.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.089
We'll just have to be
very careful how we handle this.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.418
l suggest
that only human crew members

16:32.491 --> 16:34.083
be present when we revive them.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.183
Agreed.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.057
Mr. Kim,
l want a complete analysis

16:37.129 --> 16:38.824
of those cryostasis tubes.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.364
Find a way
to deactivate them safely.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.059
Aye, Captain.

16:42.134 --> 16:45.535
Commander, apprise the Doctor
of our situation.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.731
Tell him to instruct Kes
in the proper procedure

16:47.806 --> 16:50.274
for reviving someone
from cryostasis.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.436
She could be made
to look human easily enough.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.638
ln the meantime,

16:54.713 --> 16:57.978
l suggest we all brush up
on ancient Earth.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.109
We're about to meet
a bit of our history.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.020
We're ready, Captain.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.631
All the cryo-tubes are linked
by a common power source

17:14.700 --> 17:17.498
so we've decided to revive
everyone simultaneously.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.329
Proceed.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.038
The power's off-line.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.774
Deactivate locking mechanisms.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.904
Captain, this one's armed
with some kind of weapon.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.270
Disarm him,
just to be on the safe side.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.563
l know this must be
very strange for you.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.158
No... who are you?

18:57.236 --> 18:58.430
What is going on here?

18:58.504 --> 18:59.971
l demand you release me
immediately.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.768
Please, if you'll just
listen for a moment,

19:01.807 --> 19:02.739
l'll try to explain.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.242
You are all speaking Japanese.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.073
Sounds to me like you're
speaking English.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.443
lt's because of a device

19:08.514 --> 19:11.415
we have--
a universal translator.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.950
lt allows us
to talk to each other,

19:13.018 --> 19:15.009
even though our languages
aren't the same.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.247
Who are you people?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.687
Look, just let us go home.
We won't tell anybody.

19:18.757 --> 19:19.724
The hell we won't!

19:19.791 --> 19:21.691
l'm going to let the world know

19:21.760 --> 19:22.988
what you people have done.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.052
Do you know
who you've kidnapped here?

19:25.130 --> 19:26.757
Amelia Earhart.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.129
l'm her navigator.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.691
This is going
to be headline news.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.066
You people are in trouble.

19:32.137 --> 19:35.163
Fred... let her talk.

19:36.408 --> 19:39.206
What l have to tell you is
going to sound hard to believe,

19:39.278 --> 19:41.143
even preposterous.

19:41.213 --> 19:46.116
We think you were abducted
from Earth... in the 1930s,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.585
and brought millions
of miles through space

19:48.654 --> 19:51.851
to a planet on the other side
of the galaxy.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.825
You were put into a...
a kind of deep sleep

19:54.893 --> 19:56.827
for a very long time.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.295
lt's not the 1930s anymore.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.060
The year is 237 1--

20:02.134 --> 20:05.365
over 400 years
from the time you were abducted.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.769
You must think
we are awfully gullible.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.569
Tell me, what's the last thing
you remember

20:10.642 --> 20:12.439
before waking up here?

20:12.511 --> 20:16.140
We were over the Pacific,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.308
running low on gas.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.510
We were looking for an atoll
to set down.

20:20.586 --> 20:21.518
We...

20:21.587 --> 20:22.918
tried to send out an SOS

20:22.988 --> 20:25.479
and...

20:25.557 --> 20:29.926
suddenly there was this...
huge light in back of us,

20:29.995 --> 20:31.758
and the plane...

20:31.830 --> 20:35.823
stopped dead...

20:35.901 --> 20:38.563
and then it started moving
backward toward the light.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.039
l must've blacked out, l...

20:44.109 --> 20:46.043
and l w-woke up here, just now.

20:46.144 --> 20:47.338
That's just the way
it was with me.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.845
l was in my truck,
heading into town.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.882
l was just about to get
onto the blacktop

20:50.949 --> 20:53.747
when this big light
come down from the sky--

20:53.819 --> 20:55.514
just about blinded me.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.815
Next thing l know,

20:56.888 --> 20:59.152
the whole truck
was lifted up off the ground.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.920
l believe what happened

21:02.027 --> 21:05.258
was that you
were abducted by aliens.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.663
And if we can find out
how they got you here,

21:07.733 --> 21:09.826
we might all be able
to get back to Earth.

21:09.901 --> 21:13.302
l want some real answers now.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.135
l assure you,
l am telling the truth.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.072
You-- come on down here

21:17.142 --> 21:19.303
and get those, uh,
funny-looking guns of theirs.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.281
You--

21:25.350 --> 21:26.408
get over there with the others.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.452
What is this?

21:30.522 --> 21:31.682
lt's a medical device.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.748
l'm just trying to make sure
that everyone is all right.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.958
Now...

21:37.029 --> 21:38.326
how do we get out of here?

21:38.397 --> 21:39.762
Chakotay to away team.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.196
Janeway here.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.359
Captain, l'm picking up
some energy displacements

21:43.435 --> 21:44.402
on the surface.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.494
l think it may be
alien humanoids.

21:46.571 --> 21:47.629
lt looks like they're using

21:47.706 --> 21:49.640
some kind of deflection system
to trick our sensors.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.767
l think you'd
better get up here.

21:51.843 --> 21:52.935
Who's that talking?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.809
That's Commander Chakotay,
on our ship.

21:55.881 --> 21:56.939
Commander, huh?

21:57.015 --> 21:58.312
Okay.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.680
Now hear this, Commander.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.775
There's a gun pointed

22:00.886 --> 22:04.253
at the lady's head right now,
so you call Washington

22:04.289 --> 22:06.484
and you tell them we're holding
your people prisoner

22:06.558 --> 22:07.786
and they're not going anywhere

22:07.859 --> 22:10.726
until l personally talk
to J. Edgar Hoover.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.320
You've got one hour.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.262
Captain?!

22:14.333 --> 22:17.302
lt seems we're being
held hostage, Commander.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.031
l suggest you pay attention
to what the gentleman says.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.402
l understand.

22:21.473 --> 22:22.804
Chakotay out.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.068
All security personnel

22:24.142 --> 22:25.734
report to the cargo bay
immediately.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.181
The compass isn't working.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.120
l know what we've told you
sounds hard to believe,

22:39.191 --> 22:41.091
but there was a time
when no one believed

22:41.159 --> 22:43.559
that a woman could fly
across the Atlantic.

22:43.628 --> 22:47.120
Now people are able to travel
between the stars.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.430
The galaxy is full
of many different species.

22:50.502 --> 22:55.439
For instance,
this young woman isn't human.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.843
She's an Ocampa.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.338
l've been on expeditions
all over the world,

23:04.416 --> 23:05.644
and l've seen people

23:05.717 --> 23:08.515
do all kinds of strange things
to their bodies.

23:08.587 --> 23:11.078
That doesn't mean that Martians
have invaded Earth.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.851
Actually,
it was the other way around.

23:12.924 --> 23:16.257
Mars was colonized
by people from Earth in 2103.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.920
That's enough!

23:17.996 --> 23:20.863
All of you just go over there
and sit down and keep quiet!

23:40.051 --> 23:41.518
The trinimbic interference
has affected

23:41.586 --> 23:43.679
the transporter's
targeting scanners.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.316
We can't beam into the chamber,
so we'll have to go on foot.

23:47.392 --> 23:48.859
We will deploy throughout
the caves,

23:48.927 --> 23:50.519
sealing off any exit
from the chamber.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.185
Let's go.

23:52.264 --> 23:56.166
Now is probably not
the best time for that, Fred.

23:56.234 --> 23:57.826
Just a little pick-me-up.

24:00.472 --> 24:03.566
He's had a few nips
from that flask, Captain.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.200
We could probably rush him,
get the gun.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.370
Let me try to talk
to Earhart first.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.141
She seems reasonable.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.841
Maybe l can get through to her.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.009
Miss Earhart?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.492
l want you to know

24:27.566 --> 24:30.694
you've always been
an inspiration to me.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.533
Because of you,
generations of women

24:33.605 --> 24:35.573
have become pilots.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.073
Generations?

24:39.077 --> 24:40.374
What's your name?

24:40.445 --> 24:41.935
Kathryn Janeway.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.709
l heard the Commander
call you Captain.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.718
What exactly do you captain?

24:47.786 --> 24:50.482
The Federation Starship Voyager.

24:50.555 --> 24:51.817
Starship?

24:51.890 --> 24:55.257
That supposed to mean
it flies through space?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.658
That's right.

24:56.728 --> 24:57.990
That isn't possible.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.496
Only in books--
H.G. Wells, Jules Verne.

24:59.564 --> 25:02.226
Maybe if you saw it,
you'd think otherwise.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.666
Saw it?

25:04.703 --> 25:05.670
Where is it?

25:05.737 --> 25:06.965
On the surface.

25:07.038 --> 25:10.235
We're actually about 100 meters
underground now.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.606
lf you'd come with me
to see Voyager,

25:12.677 --> 25:15.407
you'd realize that what
we're telling you is true.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.742
And risk a trap.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.749
No, you could have hundreds
of reinforcements up there.

25:18.817 --> 25:22.014
l assure you, we have
no interest in harming you.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.419
We took you out of stasis
to help you.

25:24.489 --> 25:27.890
Put yourself in my shoes,
Captain.

25:27.959 --> 25:31.258
lf you were me,
would you believe your story?

25:31.329 --> 25:32.455
Maybe not.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.022
Let me tell you
some of what happened

25:35.100 --> 25:38.263
after you disappeared
over the Pacific.

25:38.336 --> 25:39.701
No trace of you or your plane

25:39.771 --> 25:41.671
was ever found, in spite
of a massive search.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.105
Over the years, there was

25:43.174 --> 25:45.506
a lot of speculation
about your flight,

25:45.577 --> 25:48.137
including the rumor that it was
financed by the government,

25:48.213 --> 25:49.976
and may have been
part of an operation

25:50.048 --> 25:52.380
to gather information
about the Japanese.

25:53.585 --> 25:54.916
Where did you hear that?

25:54.986 --> 25:57.477
lt's somewhat common knowledge.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.356
You see, Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor in 1941,

26:01.426 --> 26:04.793
drawing the United States
into a massive world war.

26:04.863 --> 26:09.698
ln retrospect, your journey
was seen in a different light--

26:09.768 --> 26:11.235
perhaps as part
of an intelligence mission

26:11.303 --> 26:13.100
devised by a government
deeply concerned

26:13.171 --> 26:14.195
about Japanese war plans.

26:14.272 --> 26:17.070
No one was supposed
to know about that.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.337
Maybe not in 1937.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.847
Now, it's part of history.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.850
Hey, l got an idea.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.715
Why don't we stick them
in these things--

26:28.787 --> 26:31.278
put them to sleep like we were?

26:31.356 --> 26:33.756
No fuss, no trouble.

26:33.825 --> 26:36.851
Mr. Noonan,
that will accomplish nothing.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.159
Please, let us take you
to our ship.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.699
You'll see that everything
we've told you is true.

26:43.468 --> 26:45.766
Show me
how to operate this thing.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.931
Hey, last time l looked,
you were working for me...

26:49.074 --> 26:50.871
and l think we should listen
to these people.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.705
They just may be
telling the truth.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.104
What's the harm in seeing

26:57.182 --> 26:59.980
if maybe they do have
this starship?

27:00.018 --> 27:01.383
lt beats being cooped up in here

27:01.419 --> 27:02.977
trying to figure out
what happened.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.018
How about it?

27:06.091 --> 27:07.683
Anyone want to come along?

27:11.229 --> 27:13.527
Hey, l wouldn't mind
taking a look.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.589
Anyone else?

27:15.667 --> 27:16.861
You're not leaving me behind.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.266
Kes and l will stay
with the others, Captain.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.737
lt'll take about ten minutes
to get to the surface.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.068
Stay close to us.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.165
Mr. Kim.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.349
What is it?

27:33.418 --> 27:35.079
l am reading energy
displacements again--

27:35.153 --> 27:38.247
possibly alien life signs--
200 meters ahead.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.507
They may be up there.

28:00.612 --> 28:01.544
Take cover!

28:01.579 --> 28:02.546
Get down!

28:16.294 --> 28:17.989
This way.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.456
What's all that racket?

28:23.068 --> 28:24.035
Take cover!

28:24.102 --> 28:25.296
l told you it was a trick!

28:28.406 --> 28:29.600
Fred!

28:39.584 --> 28:41.051
Janeway to Chakotay.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.245
l'm here, Captain.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.446
We're pinned down.

28:43.521 --> 28:45.079
l can see you from here.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.350
Lay down phaser fire.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.415
l'm going to circle around
to your left.

28:48.493 --> 28:49.790
Try to come at them
from the rear.

28:49.861 --> 28:50.828
Right!

29:00.205 --> 29:01.763
Chakotay to Voyager.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.000
Torres here, Commander.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.735
Can you give us
some help down here?

29:04.809 --> 29:05.935
l don't think so.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.205
The targeting scanners
are still useless.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.837
l can't risk laying down
weapons fire

29:09.914 --> 29:11.347
if l don't know
where it's going.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.043
Keeping trying
to get them on line!

29:13.118 --> 29:14.312
Aye, Commander.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.859
Hold your fire.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.159
Drop your weapons.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.166
Turn around slowly.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.232
You're not Briori.

29:33.304 --> 29:36.330
No, l'm human.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.704
Human?

29:46.417 --> 29:47.816
We're human.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.121
You're working for the Briori.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.214
They have ships like yours.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.451
l'll answer any questions
you have,

29:54.526 --> 29:56.084
but first, we must take care
of our wounded.

29:56.161 --> 29:57.856
Can we agree to end this?

29:57.929 --> 29:59.988
Yes.

30:01.766 --> 30:06.032
l'm Kathryn Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.402
John Evansville.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.703
This is my colleague,
Karyn Berlin.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.239
Severe trauma
to the thoracic cavity,

30:19.317 --> 30:22.343
lacerated carotid artery.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.444
He's not going to make it.

30:23.521 --> 30:24.988
l wouldn't be so sure of that.

30:25.056 --> 30:26.523
Vascular regenerator.

30:32.897 --> 30:34.296
Hmm...

30:34.365 --> 30:36.925
he's not responding
to the treatment.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.161
The alcohol level in his blood
is so high, it's inhibiting

30:41.239 --> 30:44.140
the repair
to his circulatory system.

30:44.209 --> 30:47.303
Attempting to compensate.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.947
l told you your drinking'd
kill you one day.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.546
She's right, Doc.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.055
Just let me die in peace.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.389
There's just one thing
l want to say to you first...

31:07.966 --> 31:10.127
...even though
it's 400 years late.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.498
Amelia...

31:14.572 --> 31:16.039
l love you.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.804
Fred...

31:20.879 --> 31:23.780
you never said anything.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.076
You're married--

31:25.149 --> 31:27.515
or you were.

31:27.585 --> 31:28.950
l guess he's dead now.

31:31.789 --> 31:34.485
l just wanted you to know
before...

31:34.559 --> 31:36.322
before l met my Maker.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.588
There.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.425
That should do it.

31:39.497 --> 31:40.589
Do what?

31:40.665 --> 31:42.189
You're healed.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.731
You mean, l'm not going to die?

31:47.805 --> 31:50.603
Aside from a hangover,
you're going to be fine.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.371
Oh, Amelia, you, uh...

31:56.614 --> 31:58.673
...you got to forget
what l just told you.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.412
Promise me.

32:01.486 --> 32:05.183
Fred, l already have.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.724
Oh...

32:07.792 --> 32:09.521
You've taken the 37's.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.754
Why?

32:10.828 --> 32:12.796
l'm afraid l don't understand.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.729
You went into the shrine.

32:14.799 --> 32:17.324
You stole the 37's
from the sacred altars

32:17.402 --> 32:19.734
and you disturbed
the radio signal

32:19.804 --> 32:22.204
that we have been so careful
to preserve.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.174
Captain, l think he's talking
about Earhart and the others.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.677
Tell me more about the 37's.

32:27.745 --> 32:28.973
Are you one of them?

32:29.047 --> 32:30.981
l'm one of their descendants.

32:31.082 --> 32:34.245
The 37's were brought here
over 15 generations ago

32:34.319 --> 32:36.719
by the Briori.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.982
Who are the Briori?

32:38.089 --> 32:39.989
They're an alien race.

32:40.091 --> 32:44.255
They abducted over 300 people
from Earth in the year 1937.

32:44.329 --> 32:47.924
Brought them over here,
turned them into slaves.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.227
But those slaves revolted,

32:49.300 --> 32:51.768
killed the Briori,
took their weapons

32:51.836 --> 32:53.463
and their technology

32:53.538 --> 32:55.165
and survived.

32:57.208 --> 33:00.302
And now,
there are over 100,000 of us.

33:01.546 --> 33:04.014
The Briori never came back.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.674
Now, you answer me.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.911
Why did you steal
the remaining 37's

33:08.019 --> 33:09.043
from the shrine?

33:09.120 --> 33:12.214
We didn't steal them,
we simply revived them.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.190
Revived them?
They're dead.

33:14.258 --> 33:19.218
No, they were simply in a state
of what we call ''cryostasis.''

33:19.297 --> 33:20.525
That's a form of sleep

33:20.598 --> 33:23.032
that appears
very much like death.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.734
Do you mean they're alive?

33:27.805 --> 33:29.670
Yes.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.710
My people have come to regard
the 37's as monuments

33:34.779 --> 33:35.837
to our ancestors.

33:35.913 --> 33:39.713
Nobody has even entered
their shrine for generations.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.446
Mr. Evansville, we were hoping

33:42.520 --> 33:45.785
to find the ship that brought
your ancestors here--

33:45.857 --> 33:49.293
possibly use it to get back
to Earth a little faster.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.624
l'm sorry.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.927
The Briori ship was destroyed
in the slave revolt.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.900
There's nothing left.

34:00.438 --> 34:01.700
Captain...

34:01.773 --> 34:05.231
l'm sorry to hear
about your long journey home.

34:05.309 --> 34:09.405
But you should know that life
on this planet is good.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.777
We live
in three beautiful cities

34:11.849 --> 34:13.976
only 50 miles from here.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.585
Oh, l'd like to see your cities.

34:16.654 --> 34:19.384
And l'd like
to show them to you.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.588
How fast?

34:23.661 --> 34:25.322
Warp 9.9.

34:25.396 --> 34:29.856
ln your terms, that's about
four billion miles a second.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.637
Think l could take her out
for a spin?

34:36.706 --> 34:37.833
Well, uh...

34:39.976 --> 34:42.241
Mr. Evansville has offered
to take us on a tour

34:42.313 --> 34:43.302
of the settlements.

34:43.380 --> 34:46.873
He's extended the invitation
to the entire crew.

34:46.951 --> 34:49.010
And the 37's, of course.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.388
You...?

34:53.458 --> 34:54.686
You're a 37?

34:57.695 --> 35:00.926
l guess you could call me that.

35:06.604 --> 35:11.041
lt would be an honor
to show you our cities.

35:14.145 --> 35:18.582
Captain's Log, Stardate 4897 5.1.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.584
Evansville wasn't exaggerating
when he said they have

35:21.652 --> 35:23.279
a lot to be proud of here.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.117
lt was an amazing experience,

35:25.189 --> 35:29.751
but it's left me
a little disturbed.

35:31.095 --> 35:32.084
Come in.

35:34.932 --> 35:36.763
Here's the damage report
you asked for.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.131
Thank you.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.338
ls something wrong, Captain?

35:41.405 --> 35:43.168
You've seemed a little

35:43.241 --> 35:46.677
distracted ever since
we came back from the cities.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.177
Weren't you impressed?

35:48.246 --> 35:51.113
A little too impressed.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.274
What do you mean?

35:52.350 --> 35:53.647
There's a thriving

35:53.718 --> 35:57.848
sophisticated culture on
this planet-- of human beings.

35:57.922 --> 36:01.858
ln some ways,
walking around those cities

36:01.959 --> 36:05.360
was... almost like being
back on Earth.

36:07.698 --> 36:10.360
lt was a little eerie.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.527
lt reminded me of home, too.

36:12.603 --> 36:15.868
Evansville has offered
to let any of our crew stay.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.838
What will you do about that?

36:19.610 --> 36:20.838
Maybe this is
one of those decisions

36:20.912 --> 36:22.846
that the Captain has to make
for the entire ship.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.781
You may have a problem
if a lot of people want to stay.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.181
l know that.

36:27.251 --> 36:28.912
But at the same time,
l can't take a vote

36:28.986 --> 36:30.920
every time there's
a major decision to be made.

36:30.988 --> 36:33.786
And yet...

36:33.858 --> 36:37.521
we're a long way from Starfleet

36:37.595 --> 36:39.392
and a lot of the rules
and regulations

36:39.463 --> 36:42.990
l've learned to uphold
seem distant, as well.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.334
Am l the only one who is
so intent on getting home?

36:49.407 --> 36:51.375
ls it just me?

36:51.442 --> 36:53.876
Am l leading the crew
on a forlorn mission,

36:53.945 --> 36:58.177
with... no real hope of success?

36:58.249 --> 36:59.807
You're not alone.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.614
l want to get home, too.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.244
And there's not a day
that goes by

37:04.288 --> 37:06.313
when l don't hear someone
mention Earth.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.518
The people here have built
a new Earth.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.186
We could stay,

37:11.262 --> 37:13.196
help them build
a human civilization

37:13.264 --> 37:15.994
in the Delta Quadrant.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.398
lsn't that an exciting prospect?

37:17.468 --> 37:20.369
Shouldn't we be grateful
for the opportunity

37:20.438 --> 37:21.735
they're giving us?

37:21.806 --> 37:23.535
lt is a tempting prospect.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.605
But when l hold it up
against the prospect

37:27.678 --> 37:30.340
of seeing the sunrise
over the Arizona desert

37:30.414 --> 37:35.317
or swimming in the Gulf
of Mexico on a summer's day,

37:35.386 --> 37:38.082
there's just no comparison.

37:38.155 --> 37:39.918
l want to go home.

37:39.991 --> 37:44.451
We have 152 men and women
on this ship.

37:44.528 --> 37:48.521
What happens if half of them
decide to stay on the planet?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.432
Could we operate Voyager
with 7 5 crew members?

37:51.502 --> 37:52.434
l doubt it.

37:52.503 --> 37:53.731
ln fact, l don't think

37:53.804 --> 37:56.272
we could operate the ship
with fewer than 100.

37:56.340 --> 37:59.400
lf too many of the crew
choose to stay behind...

37:59.477 --> 38:01.638
we could all be stranded here.

38:05.182 --> 38:07.673
Tell all hands to prepare for
an announcement from the Captain

38:07.752 --> 38:09.720
at 1400 hours.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.686
They deserve to make the choice
for themselves.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.283
Aye, Captain.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.809
Here we are.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.577
My research on 20th century
Earth is a little thin,

38:39.650 --> 38:42.118
but l've done what l can.

38:42.186 --> 38:44.051
Pot roast, green beans

38:44.121 --> 38:47.613
and something called...
Jell... O.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.489
You know how to make Jell-O?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.323
l even put in fruit cocktail.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.056
You don't say.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.064
l don't know
about the rest of you,

38:55.132 --> 38:56.565
but l've made up my mind.

38:56.634 --> 39:00.001
There is land here
that goes begging,

39:00.071 --> 39:03.234
and l could have a big farm,
just like l always dreamed.

39:03.307 --> 39:06.936
And for you, rice,
with a little fish.

39:07.011 --> 39:10.378
l even replicated
some ginger for seasoning.

39:10.448 --> 39:11.847
Very nice.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.282
Thank you.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.047
Yeah, l have to admit--

39:16.120 --> 39:19.089
life here looks a lot better
than what we left on Earth.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.351
lt's a paradise by comparison.

39:21.425 --> 39:23.825
And there are
many Japanese here.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.419
l could be very happy.

39:26.497 --> 39:28.192
We all could.

39:28.265 --> 39:29.562
Right?

39:32.570 --> 39:35.232
l'm just not sure, l...

39:35.306 --> 39:37.774
What about you, Mr. Neelix?

39:37.842 --> 39:39.867
Have you made your decision?

39:39.944 --> 39:41.241
Oh, yes, indeed.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.712
l'm staying right here
with Captain Janeway.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.339
She'd be lost without me.

39:45.416 --> 39:49.182
She's come to depend on me
a great deal.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.379
What about the rest of the crew?

39:50.454 --> 39:52.388
You think many of them
will stay here?

39:52.456 --> 39:54.390
Oh, l don't think so.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.652
At least, not many.

39:55.726 --> 39:59.924
Uh, well, that is,
there's a good chance...

39:59.997 --> 40:03.330
Well, now that you ask,
l honestly don't know.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.493
You?

40:04.568 --> 40:06.365
You'd stay here on the planet?

40:06.437 --> 40:08.166
l didn't say l was going to.

40:08.239 --> 40:12.300
l just said l could understand
why people would want to.

40:12.376 --> 40:14.708
The people here
remind me of home.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.839
l haven't felt like that
since l left Earth.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.351
But... but you're Starfleet.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.546
You've always wanted
a life in space.

40:23.621 --> 40:24.553
l know,

40:24.622 --> 40:26.920
but... my whole life?

40:26.991 --> 40:30.722
On a starship, day after day,
with no end in sight?

40:30.795 --> 40:33.491
That's not exactly
what l had in mind.

40:33.564 --> 40:36.465
You're not the first person
l've heard talk like this.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.866
A lot of people
are thinking about staying.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.496
What about you?

40:41.572 --> 40:43.836
Don't you have
some of those feelings?

40:43.908 --> 40:47.139
l'd be lying if l said l didn't.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.881
Captain.

40:56.954 --> 40:57.943
l was told l'd find you here.

40:58.022 --> 40:58.954
Am l intruding?

40:59.023 --> 40:59.955
Not at all.

41:00.024 --> 41:01.855
Please join me.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.587
l wanted you to know that

41:04.628 --> 41:07.392
the group you brought
out of stasis--

41:07.465 --> 41:09.763
we've all decided to stay here
on the planet.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.799
l understand.

41:14.872 --> 41:18.672
l must admit, the thought
of traveling through space--

41:18.742 --> 41:21.973
maybe even learning
to fly this ship--

41:22.046 --> 41:24.173
was very appealing to me.

41:24.248 --> 41:26.978
And l'd looked forward
to getting to know you better.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.884
l suspect we have
a lot in common.

41:32.356 --> 41:35.154
At first,
l didn't know what to do.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.423
We talked about it
for quite some time.

41:38.496 --> 41:42.660
Finally, l realized
the people here on this planet

41:42.733 --> 41:44.667
are part of us.

41:44.735 --> 41:47.203
We're their ancestors, in a way.

41:47.271 --> 41:51.230
Well, it made us
feel close to them.

41:51.308 --> 41:53.833
The remarkable thing about
the humans on this planet

41:53.911 --> 41:57.540
is that they evolved very much
like the people on Earth.

41:57.615 --> 42:00.311
Tens of thousands
of light-years apart,

42:00.417 --> 42:03.079
both civilizations
managed to create a world

42:03.120 --> 42:04.815
they could be proud of--

42:04.889 --> 42:08.325
one where war and poverty
simply don't exist.

42:08.392 --> 42:12.726
l certainly can't blame you
for wanting to be part of it,

42:12.796 --> 42:15.424
any more than l can blame
members of my crew

42:15.499 --> 42:17.592
if they make the same decision.

42:17.668 --> 42:19.533
When will you find out?

42:19.603 --> 42:21.161
ln half an hour.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.206
Anyone who wants to stay behind

42:23.274 --> 42:26.732
is to report to the
cargo bay at 1500 hours.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.104
l expect Jarvin will
stay on the planet.

42:31.181 --> 42:32.307
ln fact, l'd bet on it.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.907
Why Jarvin?

42:33.984 --> 42:36.282
He's been more uncomfortable
about being on a Starfleet ship

42:36.353 --> 42:37.820
than most of the Maquis.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.980
And he's gotten involved

42:39.089 --> 42:41.080
with a young woman
in Quantum Mechanics.

42:41.158 --> 42:44.150
l think they'd like to
settle down, raise a family.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.253
The person l expect
to see is Baxter.

42:46.330 --> 42:48.127
Baxter?
Walter Baxter?

42:48.198 --> 42:50.166
He's adventurous, a risk-taker.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.861
l can see him wanting
to take on the challenge

42:51.936 --> 42:54.234
of building a new life
on this planet.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.136
l'd hate to lose Baxter.

42:56.206 --> 42:57.173
He's a good man.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.799
l'd hate to lose Jarvin.

43:00.177 --> 43:02.839
l don't want to lose anyone.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.642
We've all been through
so much together,

43:04.715 --> 43:05.977
it just wouldn't seem right.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.909
But l couldn't blame anyone--

43:09.987 --> 43:13.514
anyone-- for staying behind.

43:15.893 --> 43:18.885
l'm not sure l want to go in.

43:21.699 --> 43:25.191
No matter what happens,
we'll make it.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.237
Remember that.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.452
Captain on the Bridge.

44:17.721 --> 44:20.281
All stations,
prepare for departure.

44:20.357 --> 44:21.790
Condition Blue, Mr. Tuvok.

44:21.859 --> 44:24.760
Ms. Torres,
antigrav thrusters on line.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.056
Thrusters enabled.

44:26.130 --> 44:27.062
Mr. Paris,

44:27.131 --> 44:28.928
inertial dampers
to flight configuration.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.365
lmpulse drive to standby.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.130
Yes, ma'am.

44:35.339 --> 44:37.933
All stations report ready,
Captain.

44:38.042 --> 44:40.306
Then let's do it.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.504
Take us up.
