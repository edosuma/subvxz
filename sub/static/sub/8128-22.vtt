when you're out there tomorrow, 

00:55.622 --> 00:57.722
     you're fishing with me     
        and my buddies,         

00:57.724 --> 01:01.459
    let's have no talk about    
 politics or world conditions,

Don't worry, Arch.

I promise I won't say anything  
to offend your peer group.      

01:10.103 --> 01:14.739
    What do you mean, "pier"?   
    We're fishing off a boat.

I forgot.                       

01:16.043 --> 01:18.309
Hey, Arch. Didn't you say       
the bluefish were running?      

01:18.311 --> 01:19.610
             That's what I said.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.512
The line you've got on there    
is too heavy.                   

01:21.514 --> 01:23.314
Shouldn't you be using          
a 25-pound line?                

01:23.316 --> 01:26.051
              Nah. 25-pound line
            breaks too easy.    

01:26.053 --> 01:28.286
Yeah. But with a 40-pound line, 
it's not fair.                  

01:28.288 --> 01:29.721
It's not the sporting           
thing to do.

                a 25-pound line,

01:32.893 --> 01:34.826
              can you hear what 
             the fish would say?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.027
                "Oh, Jeez.      
            I love this hook.   

01:36.029 --> 01:38.997
            "There's a sport    
        at the other end of it."

01:38.999 --> 01:43.334
Arch, you're not giving         
the fish a fighting chance.     

01:43.336 --> 01:44.936
        I don't want to fight   
            with the fish,

01:47.240 --> 01:48.740

looking forward to tomorrow.

have a lot of fun.

          Yeah. You bet we will.

             you something else.

     for a change like fishing.

  while you're being friends.

    All I want to know

  is what do my two fisherboys  
      want to eat tonight?      

02:19.405 --> 02:22.941
                I think the word
            for it is dinner.

  Tonight you've got a choice.  

02:24.745 --> 02:26.477
          You can have          
      yesterday's chicken       

02:26.479 --> 02:28.880
      or the day before's       
        meatloaf.               

02:28.882 --> 02:31.116
     And you can have them      
          hot or cold.          

02:31.118 --> 02:33.985
 You can have the meatloaf cold 
      and the chicken hot,      

02:33.987 --> 02:36.387
      or the chicken cold       
     and the meatloaf hot.      

02:36.389 --> 02:41.259

     both hot or both cold.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.934
    Well, you felt all right    
  this morning when you left.   

06:09.936 --> 06:13.037
    Yeah. I was fine until      
    I got on the subway tonight.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.405
Did somebody                    
bother you?                     

06:14.407 --> 06:16.341
Oh, gee, some of them animals   
        on the subway,          

06:16.343 --> 06:18.376
                they ought to   
                  be chained up.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.610
         It's nothing like that.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.446
             Listen, if I was   
         the mayor of this city,

06:21.448 --> 06:23.481
                  I'd quarantine
                them subways.   

06:23.483 --> 06:25.383
How would people                
get to work?                    

06:25.385 --> 06:28.019
              Let them eat cake.

06:29.654 --> 06:31.055
Gloria, tell me                 
what happened.                  

06:31.057 --> 06:33.224
                 Well, I was    
            feeling good, I was.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.293
              I was glad it was 
            the end of the week.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.528
  I was really looking forward  
        to coming home.         

06:37.530 --> 06:40.465
  Anyway, I got on the subway,  
          I sat down,           

06:40.467 --> 06:42.533
      and I began to look       
     at the faces around me     

06:42.535 --> 06:46.070
 and they all looked the same,  
        dull and blank.         

06:46.072 --> 06:48.606
 And all of a sudden I thought, 
    "What's the use?"           

06:48.608 --> 06:53.511
All you need, little girl,      
 is a good dose of castor oil.  

06:53.513 --> 06:54.612
             What?              

06:54.614 --> 06:55.813
         That's right.          

06:55.815 --> 06:57.081
Any time I ever come home       

06:57.083 --> 06:58.483
          with my tail          
      dragging behind me,       

06:58.485 --> 06:59.884
          that's what           
     my mother done to me.      

06:59.886 --> 07:01.919
She'd grab me by the nose,      
    open up the kisser          

07:01.921 --> 07:04.155
        and a good dose         
      right down the pipe.      

07:04.157 --> 07:06.657
    Boy, that cheered me up     
          every time.           

07:08.660 --> 07:11.329
Castor oil                      
cheered you up?                 

07:11.331 --> 07:16.167
  Damn right. It was either be  
cheered up or get another dose. 

07:16.169 --> 07:20.071
Gloria, maybe it'll help you if 
you talk about it a little more.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.739
                What's there    
                  to talk about?

07:21.741 --> 07:24.142
    It's just there's nothing   
          to look forward to.   

07:24.144 --> 07:28.012
Oh, Gloria, you've got          
your whole life ahead of you    

07:28.014 --> 07:29.480
and you've got Mike.            

07:29.482 --> 07:33.317
     Oh, gee, she's feeling bad 
    enough. Don't make it worse.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.352
        Stop with that.         

07:34.354 --> 07:35.786
                Oh, nuts to you.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.489
Eat something, Gloria.          
 You'll feel better.            

07:38.491 --> 07:42.226
It's just that it's always      
 the same thing day after day.  

07:42.228 --> 07:43.928
      It's all so useless.      

07:43.930 --> 07:45.963
Hey, Gloria, honey,             
I know how you feel.            

07:45.965 --> 07:47.731
Sometimes I hate                
my day too.                     

07:47.733 --> 07:49.934
You realize how many            
boring things I gotta do        

07:49.936 --> 07:51.835
in a single day                 
that drive me crazy?            

07:51.837 --> 07:54.138
I gotta get up,                 
I gotta brush my teeth,         

07:54.140 --> 07:55.940
I have to shave                 
and I hate to shave.            

07:55.942 --> 07:58.842
There are mornings when I stand 
there debating with that mirror,

07:58.844 --> 08:02.213
"Should I shave or should I     
cut my throat?" but I shave.    

08:02.215 --> 08:06.451
     You know, it's too bad     
 you always lose that argument. 

08:06.453 --> 08:09.620
I'm talking to Gloria. Will you 
lay off with the stupid remarks?

08:09.622 --> 08:10.854
                 It's my table--
You're not helping.             

08:10.856 --> 08:12.423
We've got a problem.            
                 Don't tell me--

08:12.425 --> 08:14.692
      That's another thing      
    that's always the same,     

08:14.694 --> 08:17.728
the two of you arguing and      
  always about the same thing.  

08:17.730 --> 08:20.131
     Nothing every changes      
     in this crummy house.      

08:20.133 --> 08:21.466
            What do you mean,   
                "crummy house"? 

08:21.468 --> 08:22.800
                Where do you get
                that stuff?     

08:22.802 --> 08:24.268
    Gloria, that ain't nice.    

08:24.270 --> 08:27.638
 Your father and me have always 
 tried to give you a good home. 

08:27.640 --> 08:30.808
Yeah. But it's always the same, 
     every night the same.      

08:30.810 --> 08:32.643
      "How was your day?"       
            "Lousy."            

08:32.645 --> 08:34.145
 The same, "What's for dinner?" 

08:34.147 --> 08:35.413
The same, "Get me a beer."      

08:35.414 --> 08:37.715
Is that all life's about?       
        Excuse me.              

08:37.717 --> 08:40.683
Wait a minute. You ain't getting
  away with that, little girl.  

08:40.686 --> 08:42.186
Come on, now.                   

08:42.188 --> 08:44.188
This ain't                      
no royal palace here.           

08:44.190 --> 08:47.158
Me and your mother              
ain't no duke or dukess.        

08:49.661 --> 08:51.895
But I think                     
we've done pretty good.         

08:51.897 --> 08:54.298
      Not in my book you didn't.
Well, just what do you mean?    

08:54.300 --> 08:56.367
Ooh!                            
    What is this here?          

08:56.369 --> 09:01.405
Gloria feels upset. I'm sure she
 don't mean what she's saying.  

09:01.407 --> 09:04.175
Yes, I do! Don't you understand?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.877
      I don't wanna end up      
      like the two of you!

09:24.696 --> 09:25.796
  Edith, Edith, where are you?  

09:25.798 --> 09:27.632
EDITH: In the                   
kitchen, Archie.                

09:27.634 --> 09:29.467
Oh, you're in the kitchen, huh? 

09:29.469 --> 09:31.469
Why didn't you wake me up       
     a little bit earlier?      

09:31.471 --> 09:33.471
            It's after 5 a.m.,  
          I'm gonna have to rush

09:33.473 --> 09:34.472
                    to make that
                fishing boat.   

09:34.474 --> 09:36.440
You've got                      
plenty of time.                 

09:36.442 --> 09:38.809
          Edith, and the house  
        is as cold as an icebox.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.411
              Didn't you think  
            to turn up the heat?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.812
    Oh, I don't think           
    we should, Archie,          

09:41.814 --> 09:44.081
not with the energy crisis.     

09:44.083 --> 09:45.616
     Oh, the energy crisis.     

09:45.618 --> 09:48.553
 I wish you would come up with  
one of them hot flashes of yours

09:48.555 --> 09:50.188
      now that we need it.      

09:51.923 --> 09:53.957
    Come on, come on.           

09:53.959 --> 09:56.794
Here's your coffee.             
Now, I got everything ready.    

09:56.796 --> 09:58.462
                    Oh, yeah?   
Oh, yeah.                       

09:58.464 --> 10:00.764
I've been up                    
a couple of hours.              

10:00.766 --> 10:03.133
             I couldn't sleep   
            last night.         

10:03.135 --> 10:07.171
         I think because of     
      what Gloria said to us.   

10:07.173 --> 10:08.506
          Oh, listen,           
     that daughter of yours     

10:08.508 --> 10:09.773
is pretty fresh there, you know.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.409
      People tell me that       
    she's got my eyes,          

10:11.411 --> 10:15.413
    but that mouth of hers,     
that's your side of the family. 

10:15.415 --> 10:18.115
 Imagine a daughter saying them 
things to her mother and father.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.285
         I don't think          
    that was Gloria talking.    

10:21.287 --> 10:24.555
         Oh, gee, what,         
the devil make her do it?       

10:24.557 --> 10:28.259
Maybe I ought to get one of them
priests in to exercise with her.

10:34.766 --> 10:39.303
         No, something          
     was bothering Gloria,      

10:39.305 --> 10:43.006
so she took it out on the people
    that are closest to her.    

10:43.008 --> 10:44.442
Well, what kind of talk is that,

10:44.444 --> 10:46.477
        she don't wanna         
      end up like us, huh?      

10:46.479 --> 10:48.078
We didn't end up so bad, did we?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.080
     I always did all right     
    by you, didn't I?           

10:50.082 --> 10:51.181
        Oh, yeah.               

10:51.183 --> 10:52.583
After all, you got a nice life. 

10:52.585 --> 10:54.252
      You got a home here.      

10:54.254 --> 10:56.621
        You got clothes,        
 you got a color TV out there.  

10:56.623 --> 10:59.990
You got all the dishes you need.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.293
    Can you ask for anything    
      I wouldn't give you?      

11:02.295 --> 11:06.897
Well, I could use another       
$10 a week for the house money. 

11:06.899 --> 11:10.234
 Well, you ain't getting that.  

11:10.236 --> 11:12.870
Yeah. Well, here you are.       

11:12.872 --> 11:15.273
            Where are you going?
          I better call Mike.   

11:15.275 --> 11:16.741
You mean to tell me             
that meathead                   

11:16.743 --> 11:18.075
ain't been down                 
to breakfast yet?               

11:18.077 --> 11:20.077
                    No.         
Get out of the way.             
I'll call him myself.           

11:20.079 --> 11:23.080
You can't depend                
on that guy for nothing.        

11:25.016 --> 11:27.184
Well, what are you doing up     
so early, little girl?          

11:27.186 --> 11:28.686
            I couldn't sleep.   

11:28.688 --> 11:29.953
Oh, well,                       
I'm not surprised.              

11:29.955 --> 11:32.222
How could anybody sleep         
in a crummy house like this?    

11:32.224 --> 11:35.225
      Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry      
 about what I said last night.  

11:35.227 --> 11:36.827
You're sorry? Well,             
that goes double for me.        

11:36.829 --> 11:38.696
             Daddy, please don't
              be angry with me. 

11:38.698 --> 11:40.298
                 I didn't know  
              what I was saying.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.700
     I mean, whatever I said,   
  it had nothing to do with you.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.101
                 I guess I was  
              talking that way--

11:44.103 --> 11:45.703
Hold it. Hold it.               
Hold it. Hold it.               

11:45.705 --> 11:49.106
If it's female,                 
don't tell me, huh?             

11:49.108 --> 11:50.908
I just want to know             
how you are.                    

11:50.910 --> 11:51.909
Are you all right?              

11:51.911 --> 11:54.378
                Yeah, Daddy.    
                  I'm all right.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.380
Well, if you're gonna           
sit down here, it's cold.       

11:56.382 --> 11:57.981
Maybe you ought to get          
your blanket, huh?              

11:57.983 --> 11:59.183
                  No, thank you.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.018
Why don't you                   
go back up to bed?              

12:01.020 --> 12:03.887
              Oh, no. I'm afraid
              I'll wake Michael.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.289
      You'll wake Michael?      

12:05.291 --> 12:07.991
  You mean to tell me he ain't  
     out of that sack yet?      

12:07.993 --> 12:10.761
The one time I wanted him       
with me, and he ain't here!     

12:10.763 --> 12:13.130
      That bum could sleep      
        a hundred years.        

12:16.768 --> 12:19.537
                     Oh, jeez,  
                look at this.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.409
            Get up out of there.
I'm up. I'm up.                 

12:25.411 --> 12:27.411
      Get out of the bed, there!
          What are you doing?   

12:27.413 --> 12:28.479
              Here's your pants.
Sh, sh!                         

12:28.481 --> 12:29.780
        Get them on you, huh?   
Sh!                             

12:29.782 --> 12:31.415
                 I can never    
             depend on you for--

12:31.417 --> 12:33.617
            Hold it! Hold it!   
        What are you doing here?

12:33.619 --> 12:36.019
    You're putting your pants on
         over your pajamas.     

12:36.021 --> 12:38.021
It's all right.                 
It'll be cold on the boat.      

12:38.023 --> 12:39.590
I don't have                    
any long underwear.             

12:39.592 --> 12:40.991
                  All right,    
             just hurry up, huh?

12:40.993 --> 12:42.025
Will you shush!                 

12:42.027 --> 12:43.026
                     Why are you
                    shushing me?

12:43.028 --> 12:44.995
I don't want to                 
wake up Gloria!                 

12:44.997 --> 12:47.998
              Gloria ain't here!
            She's downstairs.   

12:50.969 --> 12:52.135
What's she doing                
     downstairs?                

12:52.137 --> 12:53.604
She's sitting                   
in a chair down there.          

12:53.606 --> 12:54.605
She's all right.                

12:54.607 --> 12:56.273
                How do you know?
She told me.                    

12:56.275 --> 12:57.274
                What did        
                she say?        

12:57.276 --> 12:59.677
She said, "I'm all right."      

12:59.679 --> 13:01.645
Will you                        
hurry it up, please!            

13:01.647 --> 13:03.080
    Oh, I was worried           
        about her.              

13:03.082 --> 13:04.715
        Last night              
    she wouldn't talk to me.    

13:04.717 --> 13:06.917
It was like there was           
a pane of glass between us.     

13:06.919 --> 13:08.919

        catch that fishing boat,

13:08.921 --> 13:10.488
            there ain't gonna be
            no deep-sea fishing.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.690
  We'll have to stay on the dock
    with the old people.        

13:12.692 --> 13:13.891
            Hold it. Hold it.   
                    Hold it!    

13:13.893 --> 13:15.092
                    What are you
                     doing here?

13:15.094 --> 13:16.427
         What?                  

13:16.429 --> 13:19.697
                    What about  
                 the other foot?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.866
                    There ain't 
                  no sock on it.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.301
I'll get to it.                 

13:24.303 --> 13:28.138
 Don't you know that the whole  
world puts on a sock and a sock 

13:28.140 --> 13:30.441
     and a shoe and a shoe?     

13:36.782 --> 13:39.683
     I like to take care of     
      one foot at a time.       

13:41.453 --> 13:44.955
    That's the dumbest thing    
  I've ever heard in my life!   

13:44.957 --> 13:47.357
It's just as quick              
my way.                         

13:47.359 --> 13:49.192
            Wait a minute.      
        That ain't the point.   

13:49.194 --> 13:51.194
              You see, what I-- 
            Don't keep doing it!

13:51.196 --> 13:53.063
                Listen to me!   

13:54.999 --> 13:56.400
          Suppose there's a fire
            in the house        

13:56.402 --> 13:58.869
        and you've got to run   
            for your life.      

13:58.871 --> 14:02.773
     Your way, all you've got on
    is one shoe and a sock.     

14:02.775 --> 14:05.509
        My way, you've got on   
             a sock and a sock. 

14:05.511 --> 14:06.644
        You see? You're even.   

14:12.417 --> 14:14.718
Suppose it's raining            
or snowing outside.             

14:14.720 --> 14:17.154
Your way, with a sock           
on each foot,                   

14:17.156 --> 14:18.422
my feet would get wet.          

14:18.424 --> 14:21.158
My way, with a sock             
and a shoe on one foot,         

14:21.160 --> 14:24.328
I could hop around              
and stay dry.                   

14:31.670 --> 14:35.539
         I think you've been    
    hopping around on your head.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.709
              Wait a minute.    
          Wait a-- Listen to me!

14:41.746 --> 14:43.581
      Supposing the other sock's
        got a hole in it.       

14:43.583 --> 14:44.982
It doesn't have                 
a hole in it.                   

14:44.984 --> 14:46.917
             I said supposing   
          it's got a hole in it.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.418
All right, suppose              
it has a hole.                  

14:48.420 --> 14:50.020
             All right, it's got
                a hole in it.   

14:50.022 --> 14:51.455
             So you ain't got   
          another matching pair,

14:51.457 --> 14:52.857
                 so what are you
                    gonna do?   

14:52.859 --> 14:56.193
    Your way, you gotta take off
      a whole shoe and a sock.  

14:56.195 --> 15:00.030
        My way, all you gotta do
          is take off one sock. 

15:00.032 --> 15:01.431
All right, if it'll             
make you happy,                 

15:01.433 --> 15:02.700
I'll start                      
all over again.                 

15:02.702 --> 15:05.936
             No! Not now!       
     You're halfway through now!

15:05.938 --> 15:08.772
        Jeez, get on with it.   
             We're in a hurry.  

15:10.208 --> 15:13.443
     You can start doing it     
the right way tomorrow morning. 

15:13.445 --> 15:15.613
    And do it that way          
for the rest of your life!      

15:24.422 --> 15:27.791
Gloria. Oh, I brought you       
some juice.

Drink all of it.

the vitamin C might be in.

Boy, I want to tell you there's 
some people in this world       

15:37.970 --> 15:39.570
you can never get nothing       
through their heads.

get out of here, huh?

my lunch ready?

No.

and a shoe and a shoe?          

16:06.031 --> 16:08.498
                  What?         

16:08.500 --> 16:13.203

      You wear pantyhose.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.920
     Fine.                      

16:29.922 --> 16:31.755
                You want me     
          to stay home with you?

Oh, don't go away.              
I want to talk to you.          

16:49.408 --> 16:50.407

17:53.305 --> 17:55.005

                in the kitchen.

                 some breakfast.

             and we'll talk.

Speaking of eggs, Gloria,       

18:11.557 --> 18:14.858
      before Archie and me      
          got married,          

18:14.860 --> 18:16.727
        he used to              
    go around saying,           

18:16.729 --> 18:20.297
      "There's no cooking       
    like my mother's."          

18:20.299 --> 18:23.934
         So I went over         
        to his mother's,        

18:23.936 --> 18:28.572
    and she showed me           
    how to cook for Archie.     

18:28.574 --> 18:35.212
 Oh, my, I'll never forget the  
 first time I served him eggs.  

18:35.214 --> 18:39.950
        He took a bite,         
 and a look came over his face. 

18:39.952 --> 18:41.785
 I said, "Don't you like them?" 

18:41.787 --> 18:44.254
 He said, "Edith, I always said 

18:44.256 --> 18:46.356

      my mother's cooking

18:50.395 --> 18:53.997

He'd come home one night        
and said hello                  

19:50.022 --> 19:51.421
and I said hello.               

19:51.423 --> 19:54.557
And he sat down in his chair

I looked at him.                

20:15.046 --> 20:18.448

he was a stranger.

your face looked the way I felt 
     that day with Archie.

Now I understand why you talked 
to your father and me that way.

  it happened? Two nights ago?

You know, I was upstairs,       
 it was the middle of the night 

21:01.894 --> 21:03.927
         and I woke up,         
 and I looked over at Michael.

    I didn't recognize him.     

21:13.739 --> 21:16.606
    It was like I was           
sleeping with a stranger.       

21:16.608 --> 21:20.477
      And you were scared       
  you didn't love him no more.

 is I got over it the next day.

You know, I think a lot of      
    marriages break up
