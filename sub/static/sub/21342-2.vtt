09:05.100 --> 09:07.166
- Look at the travertine inset.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
- Oh, here comes Mikey.
Oh, yeah!

09:09.633 --> 09:11.066
- I thought we're going
to a petting zoo.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.433
- We are.
- Why you look like

09:12.467 --> 09:14.166
you're going to
a [speaks Farsi]?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
- It's also my anniversary.
- What's up?

09:16.233 --> 09:17.700
- Hey, hey!
- Hello!

09:17.734 --> 09:19.734
- Hi!
- Hello.

09:19.734 --> 09:22.300
- How are you doing?
- [speaking Farsi]

09:22.333 --> 09:23.667
- Road trip!

09:23.700 --> 09:27.333
To Reza and Adam's
first year.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.033
[all cheering]

09:31.433 --> 09:32.700
All right, you guys.

09:32.734 --> 09:34.467
This is like
a shot in the dark.

09:34.467 --> 09:37.000
I'm gonna call Tommy
and see if he's done

09:37.033 --> 09:38.567
with his client
in Orange County.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.100
- What will he say?
- "Hey, babe."

09:41.133 --> 09:42.734
[all laughing]
"This is Tommy.

09:42.767 --> 09:46.300
"I watch the Mets."

09:46.333 --> 09:48.066
- Oh, he's not answering.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.367
Maybe he doesn't wanna come.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.367
The biggest lesson
I learned last year

09:51.367 --> 09:53.700
is to let my man
do what he wants.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.633
News flash.
He likes the Mets.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.033
So tonight,
I will be flying solo.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.233
- Is Golnesa coming?
- Yo, Shervin's saying to me

10:02.233 --> 10:04.433
Golnesa needs us right now.
Who cares?

10:04.467 --> 10:06.467
She lies,
and then she hits people.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.633
Having GG come to our one-year
anniversary party is ridiculous.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.600
I don't wanna have
anything to do with her.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.600
Her actions speak
louder than words.

10:14.633 --> 10:17.033
Like, I hope that
she's on her path

10:17.066 --> 10:20.233
but tonight let's keep
the circle small.

10:22.533 --> 10:26.533
- How about a gender guess?
- One for a girl, two for a boy.

10:26.533 --> 10:29.767
- Exactly.
all: One, two, three!

10:30.000 --> 10:31.767
- Girl. Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.
Oh, my God.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.333
- Everybody thinks it's a boy
except me.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.667
I'm the only one
who thinks it's a girl.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.266
- I think it's gonna be a boy.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.467
- I think it's a boy too,
though, but--

10:37.500 --> 10:39.400
- What's the next question?

10:39.433 --> 10:43.367
- Does anyone wanna guess
when we're gonna have kids?

10:43.400 --> 10:46.000
- Yes. How about next year?

10:46.033 --> 10:48.000
- You need to have five kids.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.667
- With Asa being pregnant,

10:49.700 --> 10:52.200
Adam's uterus has been on fire.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.667
But like, am I ready
to have a baby

10:54.667 --> 10:57.233
in my arms right now?

10:57.266 --> 10:58.367
Hell no.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.200
- Did Jermaine propose?

11:02.233 --> 11:04.033
- No, but we practically
live together.

11:04.066 --> 11:06.133
- Let's be real.

11:09.300 --> 11:09.567
[upbeat music]

11:12.400 --> 11:14.633
- Are we almost there?
I'm, like, really hot.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.400
- Let's go.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.700
- Hello!
- Hi. How are you?

11:17.734 --> 11:19.266
- Doing well.
How are you?

11:19.300 --> 11:20.700
- For me,
not pulling the trigger

11:20.734 --> 11:23.400
on getting married in Thailand
was a blessing.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.433
I look back on it as something
that I had to go through.

11:27.467 --> 11:30.567
The whole Thailand thing
is beautiful.

11:30.567 --> 11:34.500
But getting married?
That's not happening.

11:34.533 --> 11:36.266
Not so much Adam.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.300
So because Adam loves animals,

11:39.333 --> 11:41.300
lets have
our anniversary dinner

11:41.333 --> 11:43.166
at the Wildlife WayStation...

11:43.166 --> 11:45.467
- We're gonna walk up
and see some tigers.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.200
- Yay. We love tigers.
- Yay!

11:48.200 --> 11:49.667
- And Adam will get to have

11:49.700 --> 11:52.467
that tiger experience
he missed out on.

11:52.467 --> 11:55.700
- A white tiger
would almost never

11:55.734 --> 11:57.700
live in the wild
if they were born white.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.533
- Because their parents
would kill them?

11:59.567 --> 12:03.066
- They would be killed.
There's no camouflage for them.

12:03.066 --> 12:05.400
- If you let me in there
he would kill me right away?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.200
- This guy probably wouldn't,

12:07.233 --> 12:09.066
but we wouldn't
take that chance.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.400
- When were there in Thailand,

12:10.433 --> 12:12.066
we could go inside the cages.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.700
- Well,
that was Thailand but--

12:13.734 --> 12:15.700
And I wasn't there.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.333
- Yeah, but I'm saying
let's go in there.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.033
Don't shut me out.

12:19.066 --> 12:20.600
- Girl, well, I don't want
to hear about Thailand.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.300
- Her toes be hanging
off the edge.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.033
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

12:26.633 --> 12:28.367
- How you doing, buddy?
- Okay.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.333
- You having fun?
- No.

12:30.367 --> 12:31.633
- Adam twitches every time

12:31.667 --> 12:33.300
you mention the word
"Thailand."

12:33.333 --> 12:34.767
Like, the guy won't even
drink bobas anymore.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.600
- But in Thailand--
- Girl, I wasn't there.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.166
So I don't want
to hear about it.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.633
- And then
his wonderful husband

12:39.667 --> 12:41.767
takes him to Thailand-wannabe
animal zoo

12:42.000 --> 12:43.633
to kinda rub it in,
I guess?

12:43.633 --> 12:45.500
I don't know why
he would do something like that.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.600
Like, it's kinda sadistic.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.367
- Wait, wait, wait.
Are we allowed in here?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.367
- Not inside,
but you can pet her.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.100
She does, she will bi--
- I can't touch the animals?

12:54.133 --> 12:55.567
I'm pregnant.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.467
Oh, yeah, baby.
Let's do this.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.233
[grunting]
Are you DTF?

12:59.266 --> 13:00.734
Let's get together.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.600
[monkeys screaming]

13:05.500 --> 13:07.567
- Oh, my God.

13:11.567 --> 13:14.367
This one's Mike, right here.
Look at Mike.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.533
He's at the club.
He's like, "Yeah, bitches.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.133
Yeah!"

13:18.133 --> 13:21.667
Mike has a special connection
to monkeys.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.467
Mike, his dool is out!

13:23.500 --> 13:27.400
It's very telling of the animal
you feel connected with.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.100
- They're so crazy.
I love that f---er.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.667
- I mean...

13:33.700 --> 13:35.500
kind of perfect.

13:35.533 --> 13:37.467
- Oh!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.133
[monkeys screaming]

13:39.133 --> 13:41.600
[all yelling]

13:41.633 --> 13:43.600
- Did he piss
on your face just now?

13:43.633 --> 13:46.633
- No, it's water.
- I got some too.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.333
- Let's go eat.

13:48.367 --> 13:52.133
[upbeat music]

13:52.166 --> 13:53.567
Oh, my God.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.233
It's so beautiful.
- It's awesome.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.000
- Wow.

13:58.033 --> 14:00.300
- I love this aquarium.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.500
- Oh, wow.
- Wow, this looks great.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.567
- Can you imagine
when we get a house,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.300
we can have a backyard--
- Absolutely.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.233
- Do you guys want some wine?
Some water?

14:08.266 --> 14:10.367
- All of those things.
- All of the above.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.700
- What's on the menu?
Do you guys know?

14:11.700 --> 14:13.667
- We don't remember,
but we ordered it.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.533
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.400
- I'm a little OCD
with the food.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.567
[speaking Farsi]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.433
- Can you tell what
the dressing is?

14:20.467 --> 14:22.133
- Yeah, it's Caesar.
- Oh, I can't have Caser.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.033
It's not the seafood,
it's the raw egg.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.033
- Excuse me,
can you bring out, like,

14:26.033 --> 14:28.266
a plate of salad
without any dressing on it?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.300
For her?
- Without any dressing?

14:30.333 --> 14:32.266
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.066
- Annalise,
what's your plan?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.734
- For?
- You live in Australia.

14:36.734 --> 14:39.467
Shervin be swervin' in LA...

14:39.500 --> 14:43.166
When you're seeing someone,
being on the same...

14:43.200 --> 14:45.300
- Continent--
- Continent is helpful.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.400
- Are you two exclusive?

14:46.433 --> 14:48.333
- Yes. Yeah.
- Monogamous?

14:48.333 --> 14:50.033
- Even when she's not here?
- Yeah, she's not here for,

14:50.066 --> 14:51.734
like, a few weeks at a time.
It's not like that.

14:51.734 --> 14:54.200
- Common knowledge.
Colon.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.734
Shervin is a whore.

14:55.767 --> 15:00.567
And whether Annalise is in
Australia or down the block,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.700
Shervin's gonna be
f---ing around.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.333
You've taken someone off the
market who lives on another--

15:05.333 --> 15:07.133
- I've gone off
the market as well.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.266
- But she's the one
that's gonna have to move.

15:09.300 --> 15:13.066
Everything is on her.
Your risk is very minimal.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.100
He's gonna be chasing skirts

15:15.100 --> 15:16.467
and...

15:18.100 --> 15:20.700
So why are you
trying to front?

15:20.734 --> 15:24.066
We all know what
you're up to, homie.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.367
You gotta be put on the hotspot,
mother----er.

15:26.367 --> 15:29.233
- I know.
I know, brother. I know.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.066
- I just want
mushrooms please.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.300
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.500
- Oh, yes.
I want that too.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.066
- Yes, honey.
- The food is excellent.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.600
- I have a question,
I wanna know

15:38.633 --> 15:40.700
who here is gonna
have a baby next.

15:40.734 --> 15:42.233
- We need to talk
about this as a family.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.633
- We're talking right now.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.633
- He's--
He's so annoying.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.633
You know how much I love y--
- Do I ever call you annoying?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.066
- No, I--
- I never call you annoying.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.233
- Okay, honey.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.767
When he does this,
it's annoying.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.200
He'll be like,
"You know what?

15:54.233 --> 15:56.233
"We need to have kids.

15:56.266 --> 15:58.667
Because our kids have
to grow up with Asa's kid."

15:58.667 --> 16:00.333
And then he'll be like,

16:00.367 --> 16:02.133
"Why don't we move
to the west side--"

16:02.166 --> 16:03.500
- Yes!
- "So we can be closer to Asa!"

16:03.533 --> 16:06.333
I'm like, "F--- Asa.
What about us?"

16:06.367 --> 16:08.400
I don't know why
he feels the need

16:08.400 --> 16:11.500
to have a baby at the exact
same time Asa has a baby.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.533
Like, cool your jets, dude.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.200
We're gonna do our thing

16:15.233 --> 16:17.533
when it's time for us
to do our thing.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.000
- Anybody need anything else?
- The food was delicious.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.533
- It was delicious.
Thank you.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.133
I would like to say
a little something.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.734
I would like to thank
all of you for being here

16:26.767 --> 16:29.600
to celebrate
our one-year anniversary.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.500
From the day we got married,

16:31.533 --> 16:34.500
it has been much better.

16:34.533 --> 16:38.400
And like a [speaks Farsi]
that you eat couple days after--

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I swear, new swag.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.300
New, like, confidence,
comfort.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.100
- He knows he owns that sh--.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.567
- Whatever it was,
it was a great thing.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.000
- Cheers.
- To the journey...

16:54.033 --> 16:55.300
- And the journey ahead,
as well.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.000
- Yes.
I don't think anything

16:57.033 --> 16:59.367
will ever make Adam
forget about Thailand,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.300
but tonight is still great.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.767
- Oh, that was my favorite
part of the year

17:03.000 --> 17:04.266
was changing my last name.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.133
- That's right.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.667
- I have my people
around me,

17:07.700 --> 17:10.266
and I have
this really sweet guy

17:10.300 --> 17:11.700
that's all about us.

17:11.734 --> 17:14.433
And the fact
that my whorish ass

17:14.467 --> 17:17.400
has been married for a year?

17:17.433 --> 17:19.533
That's cause for celebration.

17:19.567 --> 17:22.734
Someone hand me
a f---ing trophy or something.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.033
- Oh, hey.
Let's go around the table

17:25.066 --> 17:27.600
and anyone can ask
anyone anything.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.600
How's that?
- Do it.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.200
- Asa, are you gonna
eat your placenta?

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
- Of course.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.066
They fresh freeze it
or whatever.

17:35.066 --> 17:36.600
They put in capsules
and you take it.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.333

So I guess I'm
in a relationship.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.700
- So where'd you guys meet?

37:58.734 --> 38:00.767
- We've been living
in the same building for years.

38:00.767 --> 38:02.567
- No way. Oh, wow.
- [laughing] Yeah.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.567
- We just literally, like,
started talking

38:05.600 --> 38:07.700
like two weeks ago?
- That's great.

38:07.734 --> 38:09.500
- I always thought he had
a little swag

38:09.533 --> 38:11.734
and nice, cute little face.

38:11.767 --> 38:15.200
And I just said, "Hey."

38:15.233 --> 38:17.200
And we've been together
ever since.

38:17.233 --> 38:19.233
[indistinct chatter]

38:20.166 --> 38:21.667
- Thank you for coming.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.133
- Hey, what's up? Hang out.
- Hello.

38:24.166 --> 38:27.233
- I would like
a lot of tequila.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.667
- Are you Persian?
- Persian, yeah.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.500
- She's cookin'.

38:31.533 --> 38:33.667
- Oh, wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.233
- Hi!
- Double hug, double hug.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.533
I love this.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.000
- Best friend!
- Hey!

38:43.000 --> 38:44.734
- Thank God
Tara's here tonight.

38:44.767 --> 38:47.333
She's been such a good friend
to me these last few months.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.734
And going into a situation
with Reza

38:49.767 --> 38:52.300
which I don't know
what's gonna happen,

38:52.300 --> 38:53.400
it's a little scary.

38:57.066 --> 38:58.567
- White?
- White, please.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.567
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:00.567 --> 39:03.433
- I've been wanting us to be
in the same room,

39:03.467 --> 39:05.166
but right now
it's a little nerve-racking.

39:05.166 --> 39:08.033
So I'm kind of trying
to avoid him.

39:08.033 --> 39:09.433
- How you gonna get
yourself a fork

39:09.433 --> 39:10.633
and not your pregnant friend?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.533
- No, that's a dirty plate.

39:12.567 --> 39:15.567
- But kind of making
my presence noticeable

39:15.600 --> 39:18.567
to where, like, he can have
a chance to come up to me.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.266
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.567
- How good is this food?
- It's good.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.533
- Feels good?
- I'll tell you.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.233
Today, we were at
the hospital,

39:29.266 --> 39:33.033
and I saw MJ with her dad.

39:33.033 --> 39:35.333
I was just thinking about
all of the things

39:35.367 --> 39:37.300
that are amazing
in our life.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.200
And it's like, "What am I--
Like, what am I holding onto?

39:40.233 --> 39:43.467
"What am I like not--
F--- that."

39:43.467 --> 39:46.133
You know what? Golnesa,
come sit here for a sec.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.433
- Me?
- Over here.

39:48.467 --> 39:51.533
MJ, you're coming too.
Come sit here.

39:51.567 --> 39:55.400
I just had a crazy, emotional
journey at the hospital,

39:55.433 --> 39:58.467
and now I'm here
and GG's here.

39:58.467 --> 40:01.000
I'm feeling
all sorts of things.

40:01.033 --> 40:02.467
My heart is open.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.600
I don't want to have
a beef with anybody.

40:05.633 --> 40:08.166
I need to bury this.

40:15.000 --> 40:15.300
- Today we just came

40:15.300 --> 40:15.567
- Today we just came
from the hospital,

40:17.400 --> 40:19.767
and it really hit home.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.633
And we were talking about
what's really important,

40:23.667 --> 40:25.567
and what's not important,

40:25.600 --> 40:29.100
and how there's a lot of sh--
that needs to just be done.

40:29.133 --> 40:33.300
- I'm so ready for all of us
to go back to the way we were.

40:33.333 --> 40:36.633
- Let this be the time
for it to be said.

40:36.633 --> 40:39.233
- I actually have something
for you guys,

40:39.233 --> 40:41.367
and I wanna go
upstairs and grab it.

40:41.367 --> 40:43.100
- Go get it quick.
- I'm gonna go get it.

40:43.100 --> 40:44.767
I've been waiting for this.

40:44.767 --> 40:48.433
When Reza and I are good,
we have so much fun together.

40:48.467 --> 40:50.700
I'm just ready for us to go
back to those days

40:50.734 --> 40:52.500
where we used to just
laugh and giggle

40:52.533 --> 40:54.500
and talk sh--
about other people.

40:54.533 --> 40:56.233
Not each other.

40:56.233 --> 40:57.667
I don't know
if you guys remember

40:57.667 --> 41:00.100
when we were in Belize,
we were waiting

41:00.133 --> 41:01.767
to go horseback riding,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.133
and I got these things
the local vendors were having.

41:05.133 --> 41:06.767
And they told me
they're these little people

41:07.000 --> 41:10.133
that protect people.
You put it under your bed.

41:10.133 --> 41:12.266
It just keeps you safe.

41:12.266 --> 41:14.400
So I got a bunch
and I wanted to give them

41:14.433 --> 41:17.000
to you guys that night
but, you know,

41:17.033 --> 41:20.000
things...whatever.

41:20.033 --> 41:23.500
Um, but I want you to pick
whichever one you want,

41:23.533 --> 41:25.500
and I wanna say something.

41:27.166 --> 41:30.400
Reza, last year was horrible.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.133
We both put each other
through f---ing hell and...

41:36.400 --> 41:38.467
I wanna apologize to you
for anything that I

41:38.500 --> 41:42.633
have done to hurt you
or your family or your husband.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.433
- I appreciate it.
It means the world to me.

41:46.433 --> 41:50.567
I don't harbor any animosity
towards you anymore.

41:50.567 --> 41:53.633
I love you, I thank you,
and I apologize

41:53.667 --> 41:56.633
for what I did to you
that upset and hurt you.

41:56.667 --> 42:02.000
So let's move forward
from this point.

42:02.033 --> 42:03.633
- It doesn't matter anymore
what happened.

42:03.667 --> 42:06.000
It feels like
we're all good again.

42:06.033 --> 42:07.767
It's over.
We're all best friends again.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.033
Let's just, like,
have a good time.

42:10.066 --> 42:12.266
I love you.
- I love you too.

42:12.300 --> 42:14.400
I'm really happy for you,

42:14.433 --> 42:18.667
for your relationship,
and I want the best for you,

42:18.700 --> 42:21.066
and I want the best
from you, bitch.

42:21.066 --> 42:23.066
Props to y'all.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.000
- Is there a dessert?
Is there a dessert?

42:26.033 --> 42:29.300
- You guys, props to Sherv
for arranging--

42:29.333 --> 42:31.000
- Yeah, you did a great job.

42:31.033 --> 42:34.200
- You guys,
is there dessert or no?

42:34.233 --> 42:37.333
- Next on "Shahs of Sunset"...

42:37.367 --> 42:39.166
- I'm hosting a peace

42:39.200 --> 42:41.200
in the Middle East
Halloween party.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.667
This is what needs to happen
in the Middle East!

42:43.700 --> 42:45.600
- Let's just f--- it

42:45.633 --> 42:47.467
and just get pregnant.

42:47.467 --> 42:49.266
- I'm really excited
to have you walk in the show.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.567
- Yeah, I'm excited too.
- Whoo!

42:52.600 --> 42:55.667
- We've been throwing around
Israel for a long time.

42:55.700 --> 42:58.133
So let's go!
- Is it okay? Am I welcome?

42:58.166 --> 43:00.033
Are people gonna, like,
spit at me?

43:00.066 --> 43:02.767
