00:18.447 --> 00:20.915
This is so not me.

00:22.807 --> 00:26.436
<i>We are witches with positive powers</i>
<i>We'll be marching for hours and hours</i>

00:26.887 --> 00:30.675
- I don't wanna go to witch camp.
- Come on.

00:30.847 --> 00:34.522
- It won't be that bad.
- Are you kidding? I've been there.

00:34.687 --> 00:36.723
- What?
- I didn't study either.

00:36.887 --> 00:40.323
And don't bother fleeing to Canada.
It doesn't work.

00:40.487 --> 00:41.476
Time to go.

00:43.207 --> 00:44.560
Need a hand?

00:46.247 --> 00:49.125
That was so not nice.

00:50.207 --> 00:52.675
Lots of swimming pools
in the Other Realm.

00:58.287 --> 01:00.323
Name?

01:00.487 --> 01:02.284
Sabrina Spellman.

01:02.487 --> 01:05.718
Regulation uniform,
SP pack, dog tags, boots.

01:05.927 --> 01:11.081
- I'm just a number to you, aren't I?
- S-dash-2103411819-dash-577-K.

01:11.287 --> 01:13.278
Okay, so I'm a lot of numbers to you.

01:13.487 --> 01:16.285
- I wish we could help Sabrina.
- You know we can't.

01:16.487 --> 01:18.842
But I have something
that's going to cheer you up.

01:19.047 --> 01:21.402
I'm going to
take a walk on the wild side

01:21.567 --> 01:23.444
- and spend the money.
- No.

01:23.647 --> 01:26.036
- Yes. I'm going to buy a lab.
- A puppy?

01:26.247 --> 01:29.239
- A dog?
- No, a laboratory.

01:29.447 --> 01:31.324
I'm not relieved.

01:31.487 --> 01:34.081
It's time I branched out
from physics into chemistry.

01:34.247 --> 01:36.317
I really think I can help mankind.

01:36.527 --> 01:39.121
Maybe end hunger, cure diseases,

01:39.287 --> 01:41.847
develop a nail-polish remover
that doesn't stink.

01:42.607 --> 01:45.121
Where are we gonna put a laboratory?
The dungeon's full.

01:45.287 --> 01:47.881
It'll fit right on top
of the dining-room table.

01:48.047 --> 01:50.720
I'm gonna buy one
of those new quantum labtops.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.476
Oh, let's just invest it.

01:57.807 --> 02:03.962
- Hey, look, we wore the same outfit.
- No talking during cleanup.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.237
Ten-hut!

02:09.847 --> 02:14.045
Well, looks like we got
another crop of pathetic witches.

02:14.247 --> 02:17.239
You couldn't zap your way
out of a paper bag.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.642
Prepare for inspection.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.637
Get that dirt out of
those fingernails, witch girl.

02:28.247 --> 02:31.444
Those cuticles are a disgrace.

02:33.247 --> 02:38.480
- Well done, Fink.
- Sir, I just had a manicure, sir.

02:44.807 --> 02:48.686
Spellman. Spellman.
Why is that name so familiar?

02:48.847 --> 02:50.121
Hilda Spellman.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.717
Hilda "Thorn in My Side" Spellman.

03:04.367 --> 03:07.757
You're failures. Washouts. Losers.

03:07.927 --> 03:10.566
And it's my unfortunate duty
to take your sorry fingers

03:10.727 --> 03:11.955
and make men out of them.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.839
Now, get out there
and make some magic.

03:15.007 --> 03:16.281
Out! Hut!

03:16.447 --> 03:18.278
Hut! Hut! Hut!

03:18.447 --> 03:20.597
Hut! Hut! Hut...

03:25.247 --> 03:26.760
Excuse me, Sergeant Slater.

03:26.927 --> 03:29.760
I appreciate all you're trying to do,
but I have a bit of a situation.

03:29.967 --> 03:32.561
- A situation?
- Yeah, see, it's really just bad timing.

03:32.727 --> 03:34.957
Tonight's the football formal-kickoff
at my high school.

03:35.447 --> 03:39.406
- Big doings in the Other Realm.
- Right, and I promised Harvey...

03:39.607 --> 03:40.756
Your special guy.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.605
Exactly.
I promised him that I'd be there,

03:42.767 --> 03:44.837
and I've been kind of letting
him down a lot lately.

03:45.047 --> 03:48.323
Well, precious, I know how important
these high school things are.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.802
Really?
So do you think it'll be okay if I go?

03:51.207 --> 03:53.437
What I think is...

03:55.167 --> 03:57.681
...you're in witch camp now!

03:59.887 --> 04:02.037
My hair.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.445
I can't believe we had to scale that wall
till we hit clouds.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.719
- Crybaby.
- If I had strength, I'd trip you.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.118
Ten-hut!

04:18.007 --> 04:22.478
If you thought today was fun,
just wait till tomorrow.

04:25.007 --> 04:26.918
- What are these?
- Deactivators.

04:27.127 --> 04:30.563
While that's on your ankle,
you can't use your magic.

04:30.727 --> 04:33.685
Just in case anybody's thinking
about popping in popcorn

04:33.847 --> 04:35.326
or popping out to Paris.

04:36.927 --> 04:39.999
Nighty-nights, ladies.

04:40.727 --> 04:43.878
Just doesn't sound as mean
when they really are ladies.

05:01.247 --> 05:05.798
I see you. Regulations prohibit
puttering after lights out.

05:06.007 --> 05:08.885
Conserve your energy, Fink. You have
a lot of kissing up to do tomorrow.

05:09.087 --> 05:12.124
Look, I know what you're doing,
and I'm going to tell.

05:12.287 --> 05:14.437
Regulations prohibit
getting out of bed before sunup.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.682
Drat.

05:15.847 --> 05:19.920
First thing in the morning,
I'm tattling my brains out.

05:20.127 --> 05:23.437
I'm so glad we spent our
small fortune on a briefcase.

05:23.647 --> 05:26.320
So fire it up and whip me up
some hospital-grade catnip.

05:27.247 --> 05:29.556
This is highly technical equipment.

05:29.727 --> 05:34.039
No one touches anything
until I've read the manual.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.041
- Push the button.
- You push it.

05:36.247 --> 05:38.363
Push it.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.962
Cool.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.081
Mine!

06:36.207 --> 06:40.086
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
I'll be paying with cash.

06:40.247 --> 06:44.399
First item: Mouse on a string.
Now, that's a real mouse, right?

06:44.567 --> 06:46.319
No?

06:46.487 --> 06:49.081
Yeah, don't ever call me here again.

06:49.287 --> 06:52.245
Sabrina?
You busted out of the joint?

06:52.407 --> 06:55.717
- I've got to get this deactivator off.
- I'll pick it with my dewclaw.

06:55.927 --> 06:58.964
It's essentially the same lock
that's on your diary.

07:08.927 --> 07:11.077
I clean up pretty good.

07:16.607 --> 07:19.917
- Hey, Harvey.
- Sabrina, you finally made it.

07:20.127 --> 07:22.960
Wild dogs couldn't keep me away.

07:23.287 --> 07:24.402
Hey, you shaved.

07:24.607 --> 07:28.282
Second time this month.
It's getting to be a real pain.

07:28.487 --> 07:31.206
- So did you bring my poster?
- Poster. Right.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.085
Bathroom. Be right back.

07:51.727 --> 07:54.241
They're big enough. Just go.

07:55.647 --> 07:57.524
Have fun.

07:58.647 --> 08:00.763
Here you go, Harvey.

08:01.887 --> 08:02.922
Okay.

08:04.847 --> 08:06.280
No, no, not again.

08:19.527 --> 08:21.677
No.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.645
- Okay.
- Kink?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.804
It could be your sports name.
You know, like Shaq.

08:37.006 --> 08:40.966
Well, at least you tried.
Let's go to the dance.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.202
Sounds great.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.961
You know, I think they offer
art classes in summer school.

08:45.167 --> 08:48.364
All right, I'm ready to open her up.
Put that down!

08:49.287 --> 08:50.879
We'll put a plant over that spot.

08:51.047 --> 08:53.959
I specifically told you
not to touch anything.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.123
I think that's what made it
so tempting.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.160
You have no expertise
at this level of chemicals.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.040
That's what they said to the guy
who invented Post-its.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.005
Cool.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.283
You know, Zelda,
I can admit when I'm wrong.

09:09.447 --> 09:12.041
I love the labtop.

09:12.207 --> 09:15.005
We are not keeping this car.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.603
And we are not keeping
Erik Estrada.

09:26.047 --> 09:30.120
It's not so much a poster
as a cry for help.

09:31.247 --> 09:33.522
Deep down
she can't be happy, right?

09:34.367 --> 09:36.437
Sabrina, I know
I'll probably step on your toes,

09:36.607 --> 09:38.837
and it'll be really awkward,
but do you wanna dance?

09:39.047 --> 09:40.366
How can I resist?

09:46.127 --> 09:50.166
- You're not a bad dancer.
- Sorry.

09:52.447 --> 09:54.517
I'm glad we're finally
spending some time together.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.524
Me too.

09:58.327 --> 09:59.760
Spellman!

10:01.767 --> 10:03.280
- What'd I step on?
- No, no, I'm okay.

10:03.487 --> 10:05.637
Looks like she dances
as well as she draws.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.356
Gotta go.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.843
Sabrina! You lost your boot?

10:17.727 --> 10:20.287
Unauthorized leave,
upsetting a fellow recruit,

10:20.447 --> 10:22.358
deactivating your deactivator,

10:22.567 --> 10:25.843
feeding a canine officer
a non-food substance.

10:26.047 --> 10:30.086
- Hey, he picked that fight, not me.
- Oh, yeah? That's not what he said.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.396
My poor finger.

10:49.207 --> 10:51.641
So sorry.

10:59.007 --> 11:01.123
Your two days are up.

11:02.327 --> 11:04.397
Spellman, that may be
a premature:

11:05.367 --> 11:08.040
If you miss your second question,
you'll be mine for an entire year.

11:08.207 --> 11:11.358
And if you're anything like your aunt,
you will miss it.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.603
Don't worry. I won't be back.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.196
Sabrina,
we're here to take you home.

11:16.367 --> 11:19.677
Hilda Spellman.
Oh, no, the flashbacks.

11:25.687 --> 11:28.963
Isn't that sweet? He remembers me.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.156
Thanks for the soak.

11:30.327 --> 11:32.966
Well, better go study
the magic handbook.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.203
Just as soon as I catch up
with Harvey and Valerie.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.846
- Sabrina.
- What?

11:37.047 --> 11:38.924
You can't study all the things
you need to study

11:39.087 --> 11:41.362
and keep doing all the extra
things you've been doing.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.717
- You think?
- Let's make a list of all your activities

11:43.887 --> 11:46.879
- and see where we can skim the fat.
- All right.

11:47.087 --> 11:48.645
Well, study the magic handbook,

11:48.807 --> 11:51.446
school, hang with Valerie,
edit the paper,

11:51.607 --> 11:53.040
AP Algebra, and Harvey stuff.

11:53.207 --> 11:55.357
You know, like, football games,
Slicery, phone calls.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.205
Now, what can you cut out?

11:57.767 --> 11:59.359
School?

12:00.327 --> 12:03.558
All right, I'll... I'll stay on the paper,
but I'll give up being editor.

12:03.727 --> 12:05.683
- And?
- And what?

12:05.847 --> 12:07.200
Algebra.

12:07.807 --> 12:10.560
- The Harvey stuff.
- You have to cut back a little.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.883
I can't cut back on Harvey.

12:13.047 --> 12:15.117
There's more at stake
than you realise.

12:15.327 --> 12:17.443
I can't say more,
or Zelda will hurt me.

12:17.647 --> 12:20.559
How can I cut back on Harvey now?
I mean, I fell asleep on the phone,

12:20.727 --> 12:23.082
I forgot about his cookies, l...
I made him the worst poster,

12:23.247 --> 12:25.681
and I left him at the school dance.

12:26.167 --> 12:30.445
I'm a lousy girlfriend.
He deserves better.

12:30.927 --> 12:32.883
Can't believe I have
to cut back on Harvey.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.083
How am I gonna do it?

12:36.207 --> 12:37.959
Salem, is this new?

12:38.127 --> 12:40.561
No way. Carbon-date the teeth
marks if you don't believe me.

12:41.247 --> 12:43.397
I can't even go to the game with him.

12:43.567 --> 12:46.161
Poor Harvey.
I can't imagine how he's gonna react.

12:47.207 --> 12:51.120
Harvey, you deserve more
than a part-time girlfriend,

12:51.287 --> 12:53.243
so we have to see
less of each other.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.682
No!

12:56.047 --> 12:58.197
No!

12:58.367 --> 13:00.562
I can't do that to Harvey.
I don't wanna hurt him.

13:00.727 --> 13:04.276
- Well, whip up a "no-pain" spell.
- "No-pain" spell? Never heard of that.

13:04.487 --> 13:07.923
- You really do need to study more.
- Okay, okay.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.726
I'm studying, I'm studying.

13:10.887 --> 13:15.961
Let's see..."No fat, no nonsense,
<i>No, no, Nanette"?</i>

13:16.127 --> 13:18.322
Oh, here it is. "No pain."

13:18.487 --> 13:21.445
Wow, looks hard.
It's got a lot of ingredients.

13:21.687 --> 13:23.917
Follow me.

13:25.527 --> 13:28.724
- Okay. Push the button.
- No, you push it.

13:28.927 --> 13:30.724
Push it.

13:34.687 --> 13:36.200
Cool.

13:36.367 --> 13:39.518
Now, should I make "no-pain" pudding
or "no-pain" fruitcake?

13:39.727 --> 13:42.958
Go with the pudding. Fruitcake
is better for breaking up with retirees.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.123
Right.
Okay, we'll make butterscotch.

13:45.287 --> 13:48.438
Let's see.
A few drops of hydrochloride.

13:50.007 --> 13:51.360
Ammonia phosphate.

13:54.047 --> 13:56.117
- Raisins?
- High in fibre.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.598
- And glycerine. Do you see glycerine?
- I think it's the blue goo.

14:10.087 --> 14:12.043
That can't be right.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.481
I don't have time for this.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.042
So when you dipped me and
I looked in the mirrored ball,

14:23.247 --> 14:25.124
I suddenly felt sick,
I had to get out of there.

14:25.327 --> 14:28.205
I bet it was those quesadillas
the driver's ed teacher brought.

14:28.407 --> 14:31.205
He hasn't been the same
since that sophomore ran him over.

14:31.407 --> 14:35.002
Well, we'll make up for lost time
this Friday at the football game.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.398
- I brought you butterscotch pudding.
- Sabrina, that's so sweet.

14:38.567 --> 14:41.001
- I'm gonna save it.
- No. Eat it.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.486
Looks great, but I can't.

14:42.647 --> 14:44.205
Coach says,
"You eat a pudding at lunch,

14:44.367 --> 14:47.564
you're a pudding on the field,"
and I think that's bad.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.883
Have you seen the gut on that guy?
What does he know?

14:50.087 --> 14:52.681
I guess one little bite won't hurt.

14:55.247 --> 14:57.317
Okay. Should pudding fizz?

14:57.527 --> 15:00.166
Harvey, you deserve more
than a part-time girlfriend,

15:00.327 --> 15:02.238
so I think we should
see less of each other.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.119
Okay.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.001
Okay.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.919
And I guess that means
I won't be able

15:12.087 --> 15:13.918
to watch you not play
in the game on Friday.

15:14.127 --> 15:15.321
Okay.

15:15.487 --> 15:16.920
So I don't want to leave you hanging,

15:17.087 --> 15:18.679
so I guess you should
invite someone else.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.040
Hey, Jennifer.
Wanna go to the game on Friday?

15:23.247 --> 15:25.715
- Sure.
- Good.

15:26.047 --> 15:28.561
I meant someone in your family.

15:29.247 --> 15:32.239
- So how'd it go with Harvey?
- He's fine.

15:32.407 --> 15:34.079
But I could use a pudding.

15:34.287 --> 15:37.324
When I feel bad, I have corn dogs.

15:37.527 --> 15:39.563
Mrs. Quick, I think
the paper would be better served

15:39.727 --> 15:41.843
by an editor who has more time.

15:42.047 --> 15:43.924
I knew she'd crack.

15:44.127 --> 15:47.199
Sorry to lose you, Sabrina,
but there was another editorial

15:47.367 --> 15:50.643
that really gave us goose bumps
and was spelled correctly.

15:50.807 --> 15:52.081
You're in.

15:52.287 --> 15:54.437
Our new editor will be Valerie.

15:54.647 --> 15:55.841
Valerie?

15:56.287 --> 16:00.519
- Congratulations. You'll be great.
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

16:00.687 --> 16:03.042
I'm gonna be sick.

16:03.247 --> 16:05.317
Okay, here's the next question.

16:05.487 --> 16:07.762
Gibbous moon. Significance thereof.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.003
Right now
I'm missing the football game.

16:10.207 --> 16:12.243
Oh, please.
The boy doesn't even play.

16:12.887 --> 16:15.447
Come on. Gibbous moon.

16:15.727 --> 16:17.080
When flying during a gibbous moon,

16:17.247 --> 16:18.999
there can be reduced visibility
due to glare.

16:19.167 --> 16:21.078
- Good.
- Sabrina.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.886
It's time
for your second-chance quiz.

16:24.047 --> 16:27.005
That's it?
No witty remarks, no floorshow?

16:27.207 --> 16:28.925
Well, I didn't have
much time to prepare.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.282
Had to buy a belt.

16:31.447 --> 16:32.482
Can we get this over with?

16:32.647 --> 16:35.002
I'm sick of studying.
It takes all the fun out of magic.

16:35.167 --> 16:39.445
Oh, come with me. I'm gonna take you
to the most fun place in all the Realm.

16:41.047 --> 16:43.880
This is the fun zone?
Where are we?

16:44.047 --> 16:48.643
This is grey space.
Or some call it decorator white.

16:48.847 --> 16:52.396
- And we're here because?
- Oh, this is your test.

16:53.407 --> 16:57.116
- Show me the real Sabrina.
- What? This wasn't in the handbook.

16:57.327 --> 17:01.718
No, no, you're right, but if you studied,
well, then you can do this.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.640
I still don't know what you mean,
but I'll try something.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.118
Oh, very nice.

17:16.527 --> 17:18.994
That was fun.
Finally, magic is fun again.

17:19.207 --> 17:21.800
Sabrina Spellman, you've learned
that magic is a way of life.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.958
- It's a part of who you are.
- I passed?

17:24.166 --> 17:27.397
- But it comes with responsibility.
- I didn't pass.

17:27.607 --> 17:30.804
You showed you're responsible
by studying, then you got to have fun.

17:31.007 --> 17:33.362
If I cry, will you tell me?

17:33.567 --> 17:36.365
This is the best part of the job.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.716
Aside from the money.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.925
- I passed!
- With flying colours.

17:42.087 --> 17:43.406
Don't tell anyone I said that.

17:44.847 --> 17:47.725
I'm out of here.
Thanks for everything.

17:48.927 --> 17:51.282
I like that girl.

17:53.247 --> 17:55.966
Can't I just keep the kitty bunk bed?

17:56.167 --> 17:58.635
- Afraid not, cat burglar.
- Mean.

17:58.847 --> 18:00.360
Look, we'll make you a deal.

18:00.527 --> 18:03.519
You have to give back the toys,
but you can keep the money you took.

18:03.727 --> 18:07.083
- Really?
- Yes, but you have to invest it.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.357
Go with her. She'll beat you down.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.523
- I did it. I passed.
- Congratulations.

18:11.687 --> 18:13.723
- I'm so proud of you.
- Give me five.

18:14.887 --> 18:17.162
I can't.

18:18.527 --> 18:19.960
Okay, here it is.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.759
"With magic comes responsibility.

18:21.927 --> 18:24.487
Sabrina Spellman.
Official learner's permit."

18:24.647 --> 18:25.762
Learner's permit?

18:25.927 --> 18:27.883
This is supposed to be a licence.
Who do we call?

18:28.047 --> 18:29.036
Honey, it's right.

18:29.247 --> 18:31.556
Everyone knows you get a permit
before you get a licence.

18:31.767 --> 18:32.802
Not me.

18:32.967 --> 18:36.403
This permit means that you're gonna
be tested on and off for the next year.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.127
You don't get your actual
witch's licence until you're 18

18:39.287 --> 18:40.800
and can pay for the insurance.

18:41.727 --> 18:45.640
Tested all year?
But I can't cut back on Harvey all year.

18:45.807 --> 18:47.798
It gets worse.
If you don't get your licence,

18:47.967 --> 18:49.366
you'll become completely mortal.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.001
I know that's bad news for you,
but you have no idea

18:52.167 --> 18:54.362
how good it is to finally
be able tell you.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.446
Great. If I study, I may lose Harvey,
and if I don't study, I'll lose my powers.

18:58.607 --> 19:01.280
This is gonna leave no time for TV.

19:04.607 --> 19:07.167
I've been meaning to bring this by.
I think it's yours.

19:07.367 --> 19:09.517
I don't think so.

19:09.767 --> 19:12.839
Just go with it.
It's a little something from me.

19:13.007 --> 19:15.726
He won't remember a thing.

19:16.527 --> 19:19.963
- Well, maybe you should try it on.
- Maybe I should.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.564
Sorry.
