WEBVTT

00:13.056 --> 00:14.666
Send Lord Harwood to...

00:14.710 --> 00:15.928
the barbers.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.061
Now, keep him alive...

00:18.105 --> 00:19.802
but break him.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.067
JACK WILD: You've met a fellow Christian.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.242
Come along with me.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.811
ALFRED:
John Ripper...

00:28.854 --> 00:29.986
runs the East End.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.553
You don't know what
he does to people

00:31.596 --> 00:33.381
who disrespect him.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.209
Working for a gang
of violent,

00:35.252 --> 00:37.907
subversive fanatics isn't rash?

00:37.950 --> 00:39.561
What fanatics are these?

00:39.604 --> 00:40.779
INSPECTOR AZIZ:
You work for Martha Kane,

00:40.823 --> 00:42.564
who works for Thomas Wayne

00:42.607 --> 00:44.653
who works for
the No-Name League.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.437
Stop working against

00:46.481 --> 00:47.612
your Queen.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.961
Or you'll all hang.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.096
GAUNT:
You were sent here

00:53.140 --> 00:56.099
to find and assassinate the
leader of the Raven Society.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.753
I'm the new leader

00:57.796 --> 00:59.233
that you came here to kill.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.625
MARTHA:
We were told to find out
your name.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.453
GAUNT:
But you killed Mrs. Darkness.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.369
That was an accident.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.459
Everything's funny to you.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.635
I had a mate called Spanish.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.681
He used to say, "Life's either
a comedy or a tragedy

01:12.724 --> 01:14.422
and you have to choose
one or the other."

01:17.686 --> 01:19.079
I prefer having a laugh.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.430
ALFRED:
I better be going.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.491
Ez. Ez!

01:40.535 --> 01:42.102
No.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.778
SYKES:
I confess it took me
a long while

02:06.822 --> 02:09.041
to get me nerve up, but...
I did.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.978
And then it were too late.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.429
I saw 'em, Peg.

02:48.472 --> 02:51.171
The perpetrators.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.521
I could have stopped
them if I'd known.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.044
Very tragic.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.611
If true.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.266
Peg, I swear
on Mum's grave.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.050
It weren't me.

03:01.093 --> 03:04.184
A man and a woman,
they had a key.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.663
Any road,
you stick to that.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.796
I don't want to hear
a different story tomorrow.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.193
Why would I hurt her?

03:13.236 --> 03:15.760
I loved her.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.501
Where have I heard
that before?

04:20.564 --> 04:23.001
THOMAS:
Wow. This is sad, huh?

04:23.045 --> 04:25.917
Do the police
have a suspect?

04:25.961 --> 04:28.442
No.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.313
Burglary gone wrong.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.228
They say.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.230
On the bright side...

04:34.274 --> 04:37.277
your identification
of Mrs. Gaunt is a huge coup.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.496
The leadership are very happy.

04:39.540 --> 04:42.325
They send their love
and gratitude.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.066
Oh.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.073
Is something wrong?Wrong?

04:51.116 --> 04:53.815
We're at a funeral.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.252
Funerals are sad.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.601
You seem angry.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.999
He didn't want
to leave Esme alone.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.740
But I persuaded him.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.307
Yes?

05:10.397 --> 05:11.833
This is on me.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.271
This is my fault.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.492
How on earth is this your fault?
That's absurd.

05:21.364 --> 05:24.193
You're right.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.586
Um...

05:27.327 --> 05:30.286
I'm just being
emotional, I'm--

05:30.330 --> 05:32.244
I'm just upset,
that's all.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.989
Well, believe me, I get it.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.904
I'm...

05:41.993 --> 05:43.995
I feel sad, too.I have to go.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.519
Need a ride?

05:45.562 --> 05:47.956
Uh, no thanks.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.914
Well, I'll be in touch.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.945
Poor lad.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.730
Broken.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.123
She were too good for him;
he wouldn't have made her happy.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.342
You don't know that.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.388
She had class.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.129
He doesn't, does he?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.481
You can't teach class, can you?

06:38.572 --> 06:41.139
Wait.What now?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.491
Bloody hell.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.326
Is it you?

06:54.370 --> 06:55.893
Who...?

06:57.373 --> 06:59.462
It is you, isn't it?

07:01.464 --> 07:03.553
Lord Harwood.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.601
Remember me?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.167
Miss Sykes.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.605
I were in security section.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.390
Sykes.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.483
Oh, God.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.703
What have they done to you?

07:22.746 --> 07:26.097
Don't get too close, darling.
He bites.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.491
Is it you that
put this collar on him?

07:28.535 --> 07:31.407
Safety of the public, Miss.
Sad case.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.497
You can't treat
a human being like this.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.281
You from the council?

07:36.325 --> 07:38.196
No. Just me.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.328
Fuck off, then.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.286
Or suck my cock.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.505
MAN:
You tell 'er, Jack.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.987
Either.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.205
Sorry.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.599
No bother.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.340
Well, man. Good
telling her, mate.

08:15.451 --> 08:18.106
Come along now, Your Lordship.
You're safe.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.151
You're with friends.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.418
What's going on? Who's this?

08:26.462 --> 08:29.117
I know him.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.597
He's me old boss.Oh, aye?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.642
That must have been a good job.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.949
He's coming with us.He's bloody not, you know.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.341
Look at the state of him.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.429
He's filthy.

08:37.473 --> 08:40.345
Fine,
I'll stay here, then.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.999
I'm not going
without him.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.479
He needs help.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.005
Oh, you're a bloody nutter,
you are.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.746
Come on, then.

09:52.330 --> 09:55.507
Refill...
top it up.All right.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.987
Thank you.Thank you.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.251
MR. PENNYWORTH:
To Esme.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.601
DAVEBOY and BAZZA:
To Esme.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.776
MR. PENNYWORTH:
Thanks for coming, lads.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.605
So, um, how are you

10:05.648 --> 10:06.997
since you've
been back?

10:07.041 --> 10:08.129
DAVEBOY:
Not bad.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.652
BAZZA:
Yeah, good.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.880
SPANISH: Here's what
I don't understand, Alfie.

10:21.969 --> 10:25.233
What's that, Spanish?

10:25.276 --> 10:28.628
If my bird got done...

10:28.671 --> 10:30.630
I'd be out looking for
the bloke that done her.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.333
Why are you sat in bed?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.773
I don't need to
look for the bloke.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.863
I know who done Esme
and I know where he is.

10:46.907 --> 10:50.606
Well, then, go and cut
the evil bastard's throat.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.608
You'll feel better.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.001
I'm thinking about it.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.655
Fuck thinking, mate.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.700
Do it.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.181
Who is he?

11:02.313 --> 11:05.577
It was me, Spanish.
I killed her.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.538
Get out.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.888
You're mugging me off.No.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.629
It was me.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.546
Well...

11:17.589 --> 11:19.330
I'm sure you had your reasons.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.335
I was with another woman.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.424
Well, there you go.

11:26.468 --> 11:29.732
A man can't turn down
a fresh plunge, now, can he?

11:29.776 --> 11:32.474
It's not your fault.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.868
You're not
helping, Spanish.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.783
Fuck off.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.220
Easy for you to say.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.526
I've got nowhere to go.

11:47.315 --> 11:51.145
I know you can hear me.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.277
He looks like
a human now.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.846
Almost.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.851
Are you ready for
your dinner now, pet?

12:01.895 --> 12:03.853
Yes, please.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.725
Wh-Who are you?

12:05.768 --> 12:06.987
We told you.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.206
That's Peg...

12:09.250 --> 12:10.817
I'm Bet...Bet.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.254
...and they're
the Spicers.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.646
Hello.
Hello.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.910
I used to work
for you.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.173
Really?
Mm-hmm.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.741
You're Lord Harwood.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.700
Lord James Harwood.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.269
H-Harwood.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.966
I don't think so.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.273
He's a bad man.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.318
He's a very bad man.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.017
Never mind,
it'll come to you.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.540
I'm not Harwood!PEG:
All right,

12:38.583 --> 12:40.150
pet, all right, don't fret.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.717
You're not Harwood, then.

12:43.327 --> 12:46.287
We'll call you... Ginger.

12:51.509 --> 12:54.469
Bless us, O Lord,

12:54.512 --> 12:57.472
and these Thy gifts,
which we are to receive

12:57.515 --> 13:00.083
from Thy bounty through
Jesus Christ our Lord.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.651
Amen.Amen.
Amen.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.655
♪ I said, stamp your feet

13:06.698 --> 13:08.700
♪ Come on and stamp your feet

13:08.744 --> 13:09.789
♪ Yeah... Yeah, that's it.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.834
Yeah, that's good.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.618
They'll know whose
turf this is.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.142
MAN: Hey! What you
think you're doing?

13:15.185 --> 13:17.187
Hey! No-Name League?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.276
What the fuck is this?

13:19.320 --> 13:20.277
MEN :
Raven Society!

13:20.321 --> 13:22.366
Raven Society!

13:22.410 --> 13:24.194
Ah!

13:32.768 --> 13:34.988
Oy!

13:35.031 --> 13:36.641
Oy! What are
you doing?

13:36.685 --> 13:38.469
What do you think
you're doing?

14:05.714 --> 14:07.237
Sir?
You okay?

14:17.682 --> 14:20.120
Joshua. You scared me.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.817
Peace and freedom, sir.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.255
Long live the No-Name League.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.909
What's up?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.563
The leader wants to see you.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.217
Now?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.045
Now. Come on.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.766
THOMAS:
This way? You're sure?

14:57.809 --> 14:59.768
JOSHUA:
Yeah, come on. Keep going.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.516
Keep moving.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.705
MAN: Green.
Might as well.

15:23.748 --> 15:24.924
Very nice.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.316
Keep them between the lines.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.709
That's it.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.493
Very good.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.714
Ah. Welcome, Tom, welcome.
Join us.

15:32.757 --> 15:36.196
Wonderful to see you.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.198
Indeed.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.983
Undine.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.637
Julian.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.465
UNDINE:
Do sit.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.165
Thank you for inviting me.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.911
Thank you.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.959
BOTH:
Peace and freedom.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.917
Peace and freedom.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.966
The brie's going off.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.142
You must eat
as much as you can manage.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.796
Yes, ma'am.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
JULIAN: The
struggle continues,

16:13.450 --> 16:16.497
but it's not going well.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.716
We're losing the battle
on the streets.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.718
This morning, I
spoke to contacts

16:20.762 --> 16:23.025
inside the Raven Society.
I told them we want

16:23.069 --> 16:25.071
a truce and I asked them
to arrange a meeting

16:25.114 --> 16:27.334
between myself and Frances Gaunt
to discuss terms.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.859
I'm confident
she'll agree.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.950
We'll meet
in a safe, neutral place.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.734
Then we'll kill her.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.957
Kill Dr. Gaunt?

16:46.092 --> 16:48.964
Well, isn't that rather extreme?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.574
Or a little premature, at least?

16:50.618 --> 16:53.142
JULIAN: Desperate times,
desperate measures.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.884
We need to strike back hard,
or give up.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.494
Our people are dying.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.322
JULIAN:
I want you

16:59.366 --> 17:00.932
to arrange the details.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.630
Me?

17:04.110 --> 17:06.025
I didn't sign up
for that sort of thing.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.290
Why didyou sign up?

17:15.860 --> 17:19.125
Well...

17:19.168 --> 17:21.388
peace and freedom.

17:21.431 --> 17:24.304
It sounds trite, I guess,
but what else is there?

17:24.347 --> 17:27.394
What indeed?

17:27.437 --> 17:31.615
Any death is terrible and
sad, of course. Agonizing.

17:31.659 --> 17:35.445
But we must sacrifice our finer
feelings for the larger cause.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.056
Don't you think?

17:43.888 --> 17:46.326
Okay.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.165
HIGHTOWER: We're breaking
several security protocols,

17:59.208 --> 18:00.644
meeting like this.

18:00.688 --> 18:01.863
You better have
a damn good reason,

18:01.906 --> 18:03.256
and you better make it quick.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.780
THOMAS: I just met
with the No-Name boss.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.348
Julian Thwaite?
The commissar himself?

18:08.391 --> 18:11.046
With his wife,
in his own house.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.918
That's good. They trust you.I'm not so sure.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.139
I got the distinct sense
they know.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
They know I'm CIA.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.448
What makes you think that?

18:21.491 --> 18:23.363
Just a feeling.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.758
I can't send a report
about your feelings.

18:27.802 --> 18:31.153
He asked me to arrange
the killing of Frances Gaunt,

18:31.197 --> 18:33.460
the Raven
Society leader.Okay.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.462
Okay?

18:35.505 --> 18:38.378
Do as they ask.Commit murder?

18:38.421 --> 18:41.207
As of now, we're still
backing the status quo,

18:41.250 --> 18:43.078
but if it comes to civil war,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.733
we'd rather the No-Names prevail
over the Raven Society.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.388
Washington's A-OK
with Gaunt's death.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.433
But how do they even know?

18:53.349 --> 18:56.309
Ah.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.312
The CIA already knows
because they engineered this.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.270
You have a problem with that?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.624
No.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.583
Keep up the good work.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.634
Maid's day off, huh?

20:00.677 --> 20:03.027
What's up?

20:03.071 --> 20:05.639
We have an assignment
from the leadership.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.903
Uh-- good.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.861
What are we doing?

20:12.994 --> 20:17.172
You're, uh,
you're ready to work, are you?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.870
Absolutely.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.264
Well, last time we met,
you seemed, uh...

20:22.308 --> 20:25.311
in poor shape, mentally.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.921
I'm fine.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.097
I'm great. Raring to go.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.448
Okay.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.102
What's the job?

20:34.145 --> 20:36.017
Well, I'll tell you
when you need to know.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.236
We'll have to use Pennyworth.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.194
No.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.935
No?

20:40.978 --> 20:42.937
I mean...

20:42.980 --> 20:45.940
No, I-I doubt he'll want to work
for the No-Name League again.

20:45.983 --> 20:49.422
Well, that's possible,
but we'll need him for this one.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.858
You'll have to be persuasive.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.773
Me? No. Y-You want him.

20:52.816 --> 20:53.991
You go get him.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.471
He doesn't trust me.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.778
Not as much
as he trusts you, anyhow.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.258
He likes you.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.215
You're wrong about that.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.218
Are you refusing to go?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.963
No.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.491
NEWSREADER :
Street fighting between red and
black shirt hooligan elements

21:15.535 --> 21:18.799
continues to outrage decent
citizens in the South East.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.628
Over a dozen deaths
have been reported this week.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.282
The Home Secretary
has condemned, in the...

21:23.325 --> 21:24.326
Nutty fools.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.986
You, uh...

21:32.029 --> 21:34.858
gonna have your biscuit, son?

21:34.902 --> 21:38.775
Eh? No.

21:38.819 --> 21:42.301
E-Eat your biscuit, Alfie. Yeah?

21:44.825 --> 21:47.958
Good lad. Good lad.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.353
Put some fat on you. Eh?

21:51.397 --> 21:53.877
Yeah.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.666
I'll, uh, I'll be off
to work now, son.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.859
Your mum will be back soon.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.406
Miss Kane.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.626
Alfred. How are you?

22:48.323 --> 22:51.065
Good.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.023
May I come in?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.390
How can I help you,
Miss Kane?

23:13.479 --> 23:19.093
I wouldn't have intruded on you,
but I have orders.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.922
The League wants you
to come back to work.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.359
Still doing what you're told.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.016
Tell them no.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.018
Tell them not to ask again.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.281
I will.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.239
Thank you.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.378
I'm doing what I'm told
because I need a reason

23:43.422 --> 23:46.076
to get up in the morning.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.473
I can't help you, Miss Kane.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.345
I won't do violence anymore.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.912
I can't.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.398
I understand.

24:07.141 --> 24:10.623
Good luck, Alfred.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.799
Good luck to you, too,
Miss Kane.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.248
SPANISH:
So, that's the bird, is it?

24:27.291 --> 24:29.598
The femme fatale.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.252
Nice.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.080
I'm not talking to you.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.864
I reckon she's still up for it.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.562
I said I'm not talking to you.

24:36.605 --> 24:41.262
See if I care. You're being
too hard on yourself, Alfie.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.743
Fuck me, that water looks good.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.701
Shut up.

24:51.925 --> 24:55.450
So you're responsible
for Esme's death.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.757
Big fucking deal.
It was an accident.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.673
How many people
have you killed deliberately?

25:01.804 --> 25:03.937
Live with it.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.373
You know he's right.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.770
I'm not talking to you, either.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.120
Esme would say the same as us.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.730
We can bring her
with us

25:14.774 --> 25:15.862
if you like.

25:15.905 --> 25:16.993
She can tell you herself.

25:17.037 --> 25:20.388
No. No, don't do that.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.390
Please yourself.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.305
Earl Grey or oolong?

25:24.348 --> 25:26.612
Fuck off!

25:30.398 --> 25:32.226
You all right, Alfie?

25:34.663 --> 25:37.274
Yeah, I'm fine, Mum.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.449
Sorry.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.496
Daydream.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.893
I'll put the kettle on.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.118
No chance he'll
change his mind?

25:55.162 --> 25:57.730
I doubt it.

25:57.773 --> 26:00.341
He said we should
never bother him again.

26:00.384 --> 26:05.259
Well, he really has cracked,
hasn't he? Poor soul.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.610
He was such
a useful man.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.047
Yes.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.093
Useful.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.617
Oh, well.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
Never mind.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.579
I shall just have
to find somebody else.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.113
Oh, I haven't done yet.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.810
Here.Yeah...

26:34.854 --> 26:35.811
There.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.465
Okay.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.079
Huh?

26:43.123 --> 26:44.298
Look at me.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.517
Bravo, Ginger.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.784
My name is Ozymandias,

26:51.827 --> 26:55.657
king of kings.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.572
Look upon my works,

26:57.616 --> 26:58.878
ye mighty,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.532
and despair. Ooh!

27:01.576 --> 27:03.883
Oh, God.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.930
You'll get the hang of it.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.063
Hello, gang.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.500
Haddock for tea.Smashing.

27:12.543 --> 27:13.675
Ginger's got his new feet.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.677
Show her, eh?

27:18.593 --> 27:20.247
Doesn't he look grand?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.683
Very handsome.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.729
Oh-- ooh.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.556
You'll have the girls
after you now, Ginger.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.255
You better learn to run.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.473
Did you say haddock?

27:30.823 --> 27:33.390
I think I like haddock.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.001
See?

27:35.044 --> 27:37.830
Remembering better
all the time.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.129
RIPPER:
Hello, Alfred.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.139
I've been meaning
to drop by for ages.

28:26.182 --> 28:29.490
But winter's my harvest season.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.492
Busy, busy, busy.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.321
It's not the cold, you know.
It's the darkness.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.932
Tea?

28:36.976 --> 28:38.673
A cup of water, please.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.721
Pour one for yourself.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.352
Drink up.
It's good for you.

29:08.181 --> 29:12.707
Mmm. Nothing much better in life
than a decent cup of water.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.581
When I saw you at the funeral,

29:17.625 --> 29:20.367
I was worried about
your survival.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.587
I am so glad to see you
getting better.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.851
Much better.Sarcasm, Alfred.

29:25.894 --> 29:26.982
You looking like
a French dosser.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.289
I'm sorry to see you
like this.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.769
I'm all right.

29:30.812 --> 29:34.250
You're a shameful mess.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.731
Be that as it may,

29:36.775 --> 29:38.907
I believe you owe me a favor.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.779
I don't keep close track,

29:40.822 --> 29:41.997
to be honest.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.478
Yeah, I do... owe you a favor.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.262
That makes it easier.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.829
You can't refuse.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.744
Refuse what?

29:49.788 --> 29:53.182
Oh...

29:53.226 --> 29:54.662
Morning, Mr. Ripper.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.360
How nice.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.062
Tea?No, thank you, Mrs. Pennyworth.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.454
I won't be stopping long.

30:04.498 --> 30:08.371
And I've had a cup
of your excellent water.

30:08.415 --> 30:12.027
Well, I'll, uh--
I'll uh-- I'll just...

30:16.031 --> 30:18.860
You're size ten.
Yeah.

30:18.904 --> 30:22.168
I normally I go running every
morning with my friend Norris,

30:22.211 --> 30:25.301
but his legs got broken.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.651
So, I need a new partner.

30:27.695 --> 30:31.264
Running? No, I don't run.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.918
Try them on.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.267
See how they fit.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.599
A glass of warm milk, please.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.688
And would you tell Mr. Bashford
and Mr. MacDougal

31:04.732 --> 31:06.777
that I'd like to speak
with them, if I may?Milk?

31:06.821 --> 31:07.909
Warm.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.969
Gentlemen.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.453
This place has changed.
Kind of a...

31:30.497 --> 31:32.107
rough crowd, huh?

31:32.151 --> 31:33.587
Hard times.

31:35.632 --> 31:36.851
How are you both?

31:41.029 --> 31:44.598
Okay. Down to business.

31:47.253 --> 31:50.169
I have a job for you,
if you're interested.

31:50.212 --> 31:51.953
No, thanks.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.390
Well, wouldn't you like to hear
what the job entails?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.523
DAVEBOY:
We're not pastry chefs.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.525
Job doesn't entail jam tarts.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.570
Well, nor would you be
paid like pastry chefs.

32:00.614 --> 32:01.745
Not interested.

32:01.789 --> 32:06.098
You'd be paid extremely
well, in fact.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.491
You want someone blotted, eh?

32:10.929 --> 32:14.193
Well, if "blotting" means
what I think it means...

32:14.236 --> 32:15.281
Murder.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.328
Blotting will do.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.115
You've changed too, huh?

32:23.158 --> 32:25.856
A gallus wee hard man now,
isn't he, eh?

32:25.900 --> 32:29.599
When you were such a righteous
and respectable man.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.429
Perhaps you read me wrong.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.737
Evidently.

32:36.780 --> 32:40.001
What's the pay? As if
you don't have a price.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.049
Let's hear what he's
putting up, at least.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.486
We're not murderers.You speak for yourself.

32:46.529 --> 32:50.577
Murder's no bother to me,
at a price.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.145
I've done worse for free.The police

32:53.188 --> 32:55.147
are already watching us.
You want to fuck with a gibbet?

32:55.190 --> 32:58.672
Oh, this job won't trouble
the police.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.414
If they knew about it,
they'd-they'd thank you.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.460
The job pays 500 pounds.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.549
Each?Each.

33:06.593 --> 33:11.511
Chaps, there is turmoil
in the ladies' room.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.903
I'll be right there.

33:12.947 --> 33:15.036
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

33:17.386 --> 33:20.650
Well, I'd much prefer
to have two men.

33:20.694 --> 33:24.393
But if only one of you
took the job, he'd get the--

33:24.437 --> 33:28.789
He'd get the whole sum.
1,000 pounds.

33:30.921 --> 33:35.665
Daveboy... think.

33:35.709 --> 33:39.147
I don't need you to tell me
when to fucking think.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.889
I'm thinking all
the fucking time.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.543
I'm thinking right fucking now.

33:43.586 --> 33:46.372
CHADLEY:
Mr. Bashford, please!

33:52.160 --> 33:53.248
So?

33:53.292 --> 33:56.034
What's the job?

33:56.077 --> 33:58.471
London Echo.
Only for a pence.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.476
Paper. Evening paper.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.436
London Echo?
Paper, sir?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.025
Come on!

34:37.597 --> 34:41.383
Morning paper. Paper?
Morning paper.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.328
Is that all you've got, Alfie?

35:42.662 --> 35:44.577
Why have you brought me here?

35:44.620 --> 35:47.971
Well, the ground's
settled nicely.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.060
Time to put down a stone.

35:50.104 --> 35:54.108
Do you want granite? Marble?

35:54.152 --> 35:57.851
Is there a particular color
that you'd like?

35:57.894 --> 35:59.679
You choose.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.202
What about the inscription?

36:01.246 --> 36:03.813
We've got the stock phrases,
of course.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.903
"Forever in our hearts."
That sort of thing.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.645
But you might want
something more personal.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.125
Are you trying to
teach me a lesson,

36:11.169 --> 36:14.215
or are you just
drumming up business?

36:14.259 --> 36:17.087
Show some respect.

36:19.220 --> 36:22.180
We're friends, Alfred.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.443
I'm helping you.

36:24.486 --> 36:26.793
I should get home.
I'm cold.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.621
Question, Alfred!

36:28.664 --> 36:32.364
Do you really think
Esme died by accident?

36:32.407 --> 36:34.148
Blind fate?

36:34.192 --> 36:37.020
It was a robbery.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.545
Police said so.
Happens all the time.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.329
It lookedlike a robbery.

36:41.373 --> 36:45.594
It was a robbery.
They took her ring.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.422
Besides, she had no enemies.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.730
True. She didn't.

36:50.773 --> 36:53.515
Stop talking in riddles.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.561
Isn't it obvious?

36:55.604 --> 36:58.520
Esme was killed
to make you suffer.

36:58.564 --> 37:02.220
Her killer is
watching you squirm,

37:02.263 --> 37:03.482
and he's laughing at you.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.527
You know?

37:05.571 --> 37:07.747
You know who killed her?

37:07.790 --> 37:10.967
You're touching me.

37:11.011 --> 37:14.710
Right. Sorry.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.234
I don't know
who killed Esme.

37:16.277 --> 37:20.325
But he knows you very well.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.414
And you know him, I expect.

37:22.457 --> 37:25.678
Who hates you so much

37:25.721 --> 37:28.681
that your death isn't enough?

37:28.724 --> 37:31.727
Who hates you so much,

37:31.771 --> 37:33.860
he wants to watch you
live a life

37:33.903 --> 37:35.818
of tortured misery?

37:37.951 --> 37:41.650
Deep down, you know
I'm telling you the truth.

37:44.174 --> 37:47.308
If you like, I could
put you onto somebody

37:47.352 --> 37:49.179
who might be able to help you.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.791
Who?
A friend.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.227
They know who did it?

37:53.271 --> 37:56.274
They know all there is to know.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.670
You'll give me their name
if I do something for you first.

38:01.714 --> 38:05.152
See how your mind is
already working better?

38:05.195 --> 38:09.156
Feel the blood...
flowing through you again.

38:10.853 --> 38:11.985
What do you want?

38:50.980 --> 38:54.157
Pint of best and
a double gin, please.Alfie.

38:54.201 --> 38:57.030
You look very smart.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.597
Court date, is it?

39:01.208 --> 39:02.644
Alfie, you're looking much...

39:02.688 --> 39:04.254
Bazza or Daveboy been in?

39:04.298 --> 39:06.996
No. It's funny, that.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.129
I've not seen them for a while
as it goes. I was only...

39:09.172 --> 39:11.131
If you see them, tell them
I'm looking for them.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.873
Yeah, of course.
Everything all right?

39:13.916 --> 39:15.831
I need your shotgun.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.616
How much ammo?

39:17.659 --> 39:19.226
All of it.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.974
Cheers.
Cheers.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.460
Sawed-off double-barreled
Purdey.

39:35.503 --> 39:36.939
That's a collector's item.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.028
Swings left something chronic,
but she'll do the job.

39:39.072 --> 39:42.771
Thanks. I'll bring it back.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.339
No bother, Alfie, anything
you need, you know that.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.993
Within reason, obviously.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.429
Bye.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.040
Oh. Have you heard anything
of Jason Ripper?

39:51.084 --> 39:52.607
No.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.217
Up North, I've heard.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.176
Begging and scrounging
his way around Liverpool.

39:56.219 --> 39:59.266
Those miserable Scouse...No word he's been back town?

39:59.309 --> 40:01.703
He wouldn't dare, 'cause
I'll find about it.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.357
So don't you worry.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.881
I'm all shivery
just hearing his name.

40:05.925 --> 40:08.188
Has anyone else been
slagging me off?

40:08.231 --> 40:09.407
You, Alfie?

40:09.450 --> 40:11.278
Why would you think that?

40:11.321 --> 40:13.106
Everyone loves you,
don't they, Sand?

40:13.149 --> 40:14.760
Everyone.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.417
If a name springs to mind,
you let me know.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.597
Throw your coppers,
throw your coppers.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.164
Box your face,
throw your coppers.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.733
MAN:
Spare some change, guv'nor?

40:31.777 --> 40:33.343
Sorry.Good fortune upon you.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.563
Spare some
change, sir?

40:43.832 --> 40:47.009
Mr. Pennyworth.
I am delighted.

40:47.053 --> 40:48.620
How are you in yourself?

40:48.663 --> 40:50.404
Well, Mr. Chadley. You?

40:50.448 --> 40:53.015
Bloody depressed,
I must tell you.

40:53.059 --> 40:57.759
Look at this place.
Unbridled debauchery.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.458
Bazza and Daveboy around?

41:00.501 --> 41:02.111
Mr. MacDougal doesn't
work here any more.

41:02.155 --> 41:05.550
Mr. Bashford is here.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.595
We have been missing you
like hell.

41:07.639 --> 41:11.947
When do you think you
can come back to work?

41:11.991 --> 41:14.036
I'll let you know.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.655
Bazza.Alfred.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.613
Wha'gwan?

41:25.657 --> 41:27.093
You tell me.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.793
What you see?

41:31.837 --> 41:34.056
Daveboy's gone and you're high.

41:35.841 --> 41:38.191
Correct.

41:38.234 --> 41:39.671
You look better.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.237
ALFRED:
Yeah. I'm better.

41:41.281 --> 41:42.630
Where's Daveboy?

41:42.674 --> 41:46.286
Working for Thomas Wayne.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.157
As a shooter.What else?

41:48.201 --> 41:50.072
Who's the target?I don't know.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.640
Someone worth 1,000 pound.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.474
Can you think of anyone
who hates me?

42:02.563 --> 42:04.609
Lots of people. Why you ask?

42:04.652 --> 42:07.568
No, I mean, real hatred.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.918
Can you think of anyone?
Someone I've done wrong?

42:12.834 --> 42:15.576
No.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.969
What's going on, Alfie?

42:19.667 --> 42:21.060
Straighten up, mate,

42:21.103 --> 42:23.366
then we'll talk.

42:34.203 --> 42:36.858
Do dead people ever come back
and haunt you?

42:36.902 --> 42:41.297
What, ghosts? No.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.908
Don't you think?

42:42.951 --> 42:45.954
There are no ghosts.

42:45.998 --> 42:49.436
Have you seen one?
No.

42:49.479 --> 42:52.004
No. They're figments,

42:52.047 --> 42:55.268
the product
of weak minds.

42:55.311 --> 42:57.618
I can trust you, can I?

42:57.662 --> 43:00.316
Yeah.

43:00.360 --> 43:03.711
I know you know this.

43:03.755 --> 43:06.148
You have to succeed tonight.

43:06.192 --> 43:09.674
Trying hard
won't count.

43:09.717 --> 43:12.764
If you want that name.

43:36.788 --> 43:40.574
Undine, do stop
looking so anxious.

43:40.618 --> 43:44.099
My anxiety is perfectly
appropriate.

43:44.143 --> 43:47.668
Your smug confidence
is more the problem.

43:47.712 --> 43:50.062
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

43:50.105 --> 43:53.718
We're having a lovely dinner,
that's all.

43:53.761 --> 43:56.808
Don't be scared,

43:56.851 --> 43:59.637
smile.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.161
Patronizing bastard.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.738
Potted hare looks
intriguing, doesn't it?

44:15.435 --> 44:18.830
Ah, here she is.

44:18.873 --> 44:21.397
Mrs. Gaunt,

44:21.441 --> 44:23.791
an honor and
a pleasure.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.751
My wife, Undine.

44:26.794 --> 44:29.710
So happy to meet you.Indeed.

44:46.248 --> 44:48.163
More carrots. Vite!
Eh?

44:48.207 --> 44:49.643
More carrots,
scum, now!

44:49.687 --> 44:52.690
Carrots?
Uh, will do.

44:52.733 --> 44:55.127
Who the fuck are you?
I'm new.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.085
Merde. Who are you?

44:57.129 --> 44:58.696
Let me go, pal.

44:58.739 --> 45:00.306
You're a fucking thief,
aren't you?

45:00.349 --> 45:02.177
Let me go.
I'm asking you nicely, please.

45:02.221 --> 45:03.570
Fuck off.
You're going to jail.

45:03.613 --> 45:04.919
And you are making a mistake.

45:04.963 --> 45:07.139
It is you who are making
the mistake, mon frere.

45:07.182 --> 45:09.054
Ah, fuck. Sorry.
Ah!

45:09.097 --> 45:12.710
Hands in the air! Everybody.

45:12.753 --> 45:16.148
Here's to new friends
and new horizons.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.761
If you insist.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.720
New horizons.

45:28.203 --> 45:29.857
Thank you so much
for meeting with us.

45:29.901 --> 45:32.033
Yes, I was surprised
to hear from you.

45:32.077 --> 45:34.253
Oh, I'm surprised
you were surprised.

45:34.296 --> 45:36.429
All we've ever wanted
is dialogue.

45:36.472 --> 45:38.823
Of course we have
our differences,

45:38.866 --> 45:40.738
but we have so much
in common as well.

45:40.781 --> 45:43.653
What, exactly?

45:43.697 --> 45:44.959
We all love
our country.

45:45.003 --> 45:48.136
As you well know,
love is not enough.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.355
Oh, I disagree.

45:49.398 --> 45:51.139
Then you have
a shallow mind, my dear.

45:53.446 --> 45:54.708
Where's that bloody waiter?

46:04.065 --> 46:06.807
You know, the truth is,
we're not so far apart.

46:06.851 --> 46:08.635
Both sides
have suffered.

46:08.678 --> 46:10.898
Both of us have
lost good comrades

46:10.942 --> 46:13.292
and friends
to this struggle,

46:13.335 --> 46:17.122
and we both believe we have
right and reason on our side.

46:17.165 --> 46:21.039
Bugger right and reason,
we have God on our side

46:21.082 --> 46:22.518
and the numbers.

46:22.562 --> 46:24.129
For every comrade

46:24.172 --> 46:25.739
we have lost,
you've lost four.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.436
You've come here to plead

46:27.480 --> 46:28.960
for a truce because

46:29.003 --> 46:30.439
we're so close to destroying

46:30.483 --> 46:32.224
your precious league of fools.

46:32.267 --> 46:36.271
State your terms.
I hope, for your sake,

46:36.315 --> 46:38.143
they're realistic.

46:40.754 --> 46:43.496
Well, the, uh,
the truth is,

46:43.539 --> 46:45.063
we don't take quite

46:45.106 --> 46:47.935
such a gloomy view of our
prospect as you do. In fact,

46:47.979 --> 46:49.110
we're very
optimistic.

46:49.154 --> 46:51.156
I daresay

46:51.199 --> 46:53.854
you'd be the one
proposing the truce,

46:53.898 --> 46:55.508
if you could see
the whole picture.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.118
The whole picture of what?

47:10.305 --> 47:13.613
Would you please
close your eyes, Madame?

47:13.656 --> 47:14.962
Certainly not.

47:15.006 --> 47:16.094
Ah!

47:25.668 --> 47:27.975
Young man, what's your name?Daveboy.

47:28.019 --> 47:29.107
You must stay awake.
Stay awake, Daveboy.

47:29.150 --> 47:30.151
You must stay awake.Yes.

47:30.195 --> 47:31.761
Yes, yes, ma'am.
I know the drill.

47:31.805 --> 47:32.893
Sorry for all
the bother.

47:32.937 --> 47:33.851
GAUNT: Well, I should
hope you are.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.243
And bravo, by the way.

47:35.287 --> 47:36.810
There's many a good man tried

47:36.854 --> 47:37.942
to do what...Oh, shut up.

47:37.985 --> 47:39.639
You, come here.Oh, I swear to God,

47:39.682 --> 47:41.119
we had nothing to do
with this. Nothing...

47:41.162 --> 47:42.903
Shut up! Come here,
you stupid woman!

47:42.947 --> 47:44.731
UNDINE: Please don't hurt me.What do you take me for?

47:44.774 --> 47:46.733
Come here, now!

47:46.776 --> 47:49.214
Kneel down.

47:49.257 --> 47:50.998
Put your hand here.

47:51.042 --> 47:53.914
Pressing as hard
as you can.

47:53.958 --> 47:57.831
Right. Here
we go, Daveboy.

48:01.835 --> 48:03.924
CHEF: Let me out!

48:03.968 --> 48:05.970
Let us out this instant!

48:20.158 --> 48:22.682
GAUNT: Back we go,
over this way. Go!

48:22.725 --> 48:25.685
Tie it tight, Undine.

48:25.728 --> 48:29.123
For fuck's sake. Daveboy?

48:29.167 --> 48:32.257
Alfie? Alfie, is that you?

48:32.300 --> 48:33.911
ALFRED:
What've you done now?

48:33.954 --> 48:35.956
I know that voice.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.958
You're that black-haired
young villain.

48:38.002 --> 48:39.786
Is your lady friend
here, too?

48:39.829 --> 48:41.353
Who bloody else
will appear,

48:41.396 --> 48:43.790
for God's sake?Good evening, Mrs. Gaunt.

48:43.833 --> 48:47.228
This idiot is a friend
of yours, I gather?

48:47.272 --> 48:48.926
Never seen him
before in my life.

48:48.969 --> 48:50.579
Ah, ah, ah! Where you going?
Sit down.

48:50.623 --> 48:53.539
We're not done yet.

48:53.582 --> 48:55.323
Thank you, Undine,
you can let go now.

48:57.891 --> 48:59.327
Can he move?

48:59.371 --> 49:01.939
Well, it won't help.

49:01.982 --> 49:03.462
He'll probably
die anyway,

49:03.505 --> 49:06.944
so, by all means, tally-ho.

49:06.987 --> 49:08.902
Come here.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.343
Good night, ladies.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.482
Come here.

49:23.525 --> 49:25.049
Now stop your whining.Put me down, bastard.

49:28.052 --> 49:29.531
Daveboy!

50:03.478 --> 50:05.045
Who is it?

50:05.089 --> 50:07.004
ALFRED:
It's me, Sandra.

50:08.962 --> 50:10.050
Oh, my...

50:15.012 --> 50:16.796
Ah!

50:16.839 --> 50:18.450
Is he all right?

50:18.493 --> 50:21.801
Yeah, I've seen him worse.

50:21.844 --> 50:24.195
Put that
somewhere safe,

50:24.238 --> 50:26.153
and then phone
Doc Christie.

50:52.136 --> 50:55.052
SANDRA: Doc'll be here
in half an hour.

50:55.095 --> 50:57.576
Thank you.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.074
Should I wake me dad?

51:20.555 --> 51:21.687
No.

52:35.195 --> 52:38.503
It seems as if they tried
to kill each other

52:38.546 --> 52:40.896
and Mrs. Gaunt prevailed.

52:40.940 --> 52:44.030
Aside from Julian Thwaite,
the dead are men of no interest.

52:44.073 --> 52:45.466
I assume

52:45.510 --> 52:47.164
we should strictly
go through the motions.

52:47.207 --> 52:48.556
Yes, yes.

52:48.600 --> 52:51.255
Mrs. Gaunt, a ruthless
killer, by Jove.

52:51.298 --> 52:53.866
Gracious me. I didn't think
she had it in her.

52:53.909 --> 52:56.173
I was surprised, also,
Your Majesty.

52:56.216 --> 52:59.045
Well, this will sink the bloody
No-Name League for good.

52:59.088 --> 53:00.916
They're already
in a shambles,

53:00.960 --> 53:03.005
and now their beloved
leader is dead.

53:03.049 --> 53:05.225
Mm. Ding-dong.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.053
Quite so. The widow,

53:07.096 --> 53:08.968
Mrs. Thwaite, has been
appointed pro tem leader,

53:09.011 --> 53:10.274
pending elections.

53:10.317 --> 53:12.972
The poetess?A potter, I believe.

53:13.015 --> 53:15.322
A potter. Oh.

53:17.629 --> 53:19.239
Even funnier.

53:19.283 --> 53:21.633
Well, brava, Mrs. Gaunt, eh?

53:21.676 --> 53:23.069
That lady
has done us

53:23.112 --> 53:25.071
a great favor.

53:25.114 --> 53:28.335
We must remember that
when we have her in irons.

53:37.083 --> 53:39.564
I feel nothing.

53:47.093 --> 53:48.616
What did you hope to feel?

53:52.141 --> 53:53.621
Joy.

53:53.665 --> 53:56.015
Freedom.

54:00.454 --> 54:03.370
And now your
husband is dead.

54:03.414 --> 54:06.504
England will soon
be yours, my girl.

54:08.332 --> 54:09.637
Rejoice.
