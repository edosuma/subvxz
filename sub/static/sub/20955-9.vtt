WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.371
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.404 --> 00:05.573
You want a war, Epi,
I'll give you--

00:05.606 --> 00:07.041
-Tu hermano!
-(speaking Spanish)

00:07.075 --> 00:08.376
Today, we announce
the formation of

00:08.409 --> 00:11.379
a joint US-Mexico
drug task force.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.047
CORTEZ: He's brought
the war here.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.883
Isn't it time
that we put an end to her?

00:15.916 --> 00:18.719
Do what you got to do
to stop Camila's business.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.254
But don't touch my wife.

00:20.288 --> 00:23.291
(speaking Spanish)

00:25.259 --> 00:27.095
I want to be
part of the business.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.697
Don't forget whose house
you're in and who built it.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.499
Good afternoon.
I'm Devon Finch.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.501
Finch isn't the only
distributor we can work with.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.936
No, but he's the one I want.

00:35.969 --> 00:39.207
All of you are going to Chicago,
and make him buy from us.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.608
We just caught
a break in Chicago.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.943
Take Colonel Cortez with you.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.078
Something's wrong.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.913
(grunts)
(blows land)

00:45.946 --> 00:48.015
What are you doing, man?
The DEA don't roll like that!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.683
(gunshot echoes)
Hey!

00:49.717 --> 00:51.252
Here, take your car.
Meet Devon.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.853
We'll get him help.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.422
Well, you wanted my attention,
Miss Vargas.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.191
Now you have it.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.793
I'm leaving. There's something
I got to take care of.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.595
(dramatic musical flourish)

01:03.331 --> 01:06.634
(dramatic electronic music)

01:06.667 --> 01:08.802
*

01:08.836 --> 01:11.205
Pote says James needs
a few more days to recover

01:11.239 --> 01:14.108
from the beating
Cortez gave him.

01:14.142 --> 01:18.112
so they're gonna stay in Chicago
until he's ready to travel.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.914
It's really not good
for me to be alone,

01:20.948 --> 01:24.252
especially if things go south
with Devon Finch.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.421
You're only gonna make a deal.
You don't need muscle.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.657
You seem very certain of that.

01:29.690 --> 01:33.494
If we strike the deal,
are you sure El Santo

01:33.527 --> 01:36.330
will provide us with
the product we need?

01:36.364 --> 01:40.067
If he doesn't,
I'll have to go back to Bolivia.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.969
CAMILA: Without your boyfriend?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.672
I sent him away in Chicago,
like you told me to.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.175
Guero was an irritating
little mosquito,

01:47.208 --> 01:50.077
draining you from
your spirit, Teresa.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.246
We have to secure
this deal today.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.515
Otherwise, El Santo's sicarios

01:54.548 --> 01:55.949
are gonna be on
the first flight to Dallas.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.918
And make no mistake about it:

01:57.951 --> 02:00.688
they'll be looking
for you first.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.490
(phone buzzing)

02:02.523 --> 02:04.425
(sighs)

02:04.458 --> 02:07.127
Is everything okay?

02:07.161 --> 02:09.096
Isabela has
a little mosquito of her own

02:09.129 --> 02:11.832
that needs to be crushed.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.368
She'll learn the hard way,

02:14.402 --> 02:16.103
just like you did.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.106
(ambient music)

02:19.139 --> 02:21.108
*

02:21.141 --> 02:24.845
WOMAN: Welcome to the 2017
Dallas International Auto Show.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.780
(indistinct chatter)

02:26.814 --> 02:30.951
This is our newest model,
the 458 Italia Super Coupe.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.453
We sold number two.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.655
We're keeping
for you number one.

02:34.688 --> 02:41.629
*

02:41.662 --> 02:43.997
It has a top speed
of 211 miles per hour.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.367
The chassis improvements
provide enhanced performance

02:46.400 --> 02:47.768
over your previous models.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.741
No, thank you.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.476
DEVON: You know what?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.311
I could add a couple
more vehicles to my collection.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.079
My assistant will
handle the details.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.648
Always a pleasure.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.851
A $1/4 million purchase
in a second.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.053
You move as fast
as your cars do.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.822
You know, when it's high quality
and priced fairly,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.558
there's no need
for making negotiations.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.093
Fairly according to you.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.762
(soft laugh)

03:14.795 --> 03:16.597
You don't get to build
an empire like yours

03:16.630 --> 03:18.098
by paying top dollar.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.368
Are you gonna be
a repeat customer,

03:20.401 --> 03:22.603
or is this just a test drive?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.372
It depends on how much
is in the tank.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.773
TERESA: A metric ton.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.741
There's more
where that came from.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.577
You can guarantee that?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.245
CAMILA: There's no guarantees
in my line of work.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.348
If you want security,
stick to annuities.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.517
Otherwise, what we offer

03:36.550 --> 03:38.286
can get you
every car in this room.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.754
(phone buzzing)

03:40.788 --> 03:43.757
(soft dramatic music)

03:43.791 --> 03:47.695
*

03:47.728 --> 03:50.097
Excuse me.

03:50.130 --> 03:56.737
*

03:58.506 --> 04:00.073
MAN (over TV): Culiacán
governor Epifanio Vargas

04:00.107 --> 04:02.075
is returning home
to Mexico today

04:02.109 --> 04:04.378
after reportedly suffering
a minor heart attack

04:04.412 --> 04:06.113
in the States,
and receiving treatment

04:06.146 --> 04:08.115
at Dallas University
Medical Center.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.584
Governor Vargas was in Texas
for the launch of

04:10.618 --> 04:13.554
a joint US-Mexican task force
spearheaded by the DEA

04:13.587 --> 04:17.090
and Mexican army colonel
Alberto Cortez.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.726
Focus on stopping a recent rash
of cartel-related violence...

04:18.759 --> 04:19.893
(phone buzzing)

04:19.927 --> 04:21.629
EPI: Hola, Colonel.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.632
(speaking Spanish)

04:26.634 --> 04:29.437
(speaking Spanish)

04:47.555 --> 04:50.257
But if I'm dead, it doesn't
matter anyway, now does it?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.125
EPI: You saved my life before.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.328
You are the only one
I can trust to protect me.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.530
Ones Dallas is burnt
for Camila,

04:56.564 --> 04:58.432
then I will return to Culiacán.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.134
Camila inhales fire
like others do a rose, Colonel.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.604
If you haven't burned her
by now, you won't.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.507
It will still look like we made
our best efforts to stop her.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.976
Your voters will respect that.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.978
(speaking Spanish)

05:11.011 --> 05:13.381
But let me remind you that
Camila is not to be touched.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.616
CORTEZ: That goes without
saying, Governor.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.618
Nothing happens

05:17.651 --> 05:19.853
without you
giving the order first.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.822
Okay.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.825
(brooding music)

05:24.858 --> 05:25.726
*

05:25.759 --> 05:29.897
(bird calling)

05:29.930 --> 05:31.499
(ominous music)

05:31.532 --> 05:33.000
(gunshot)

05:33.033 --> 05:34.334
(pistol firing)

05:34.368 --> 05:35.536
(dramatic whoosh)

05:35.569 --> 05:37.337
*

05:37.371 --> 05:38.806
(phone beeps)
(line trilling)

05:38.839 --> 05:41.074
(woman speaking Spanish)

05:41.108 --> 05:42.876
Camila, soy yo.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.913

05:49.417 --> 05:51.419
(brooding music)

*

06:19.547 --> 06:21.415
(phone ringing)

06:21.449 --> 06:22.916
(phone clicks)
Yeah?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.518
You're taking
drunken pictures

06:24.552 --> 06:26.019
in front of
cocaine now, Isabela?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.188
No.
what are you talking about?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.524
CAMILA: I know what I saw.
Don't lie to me.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.259
Are you stalking my IG?

06:32.292 --> 06:34.061
You have no regard for what

06:34.094 --> 06:35.696
you're exposing yourself to.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.264
Ay, it's not like
you give a damn.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.066
You're hardly
poster mom of the year.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.768
Well, you know,
Kique Jimenez is a problem,

06:40.801 --> 06:42.436
and I'm gonna tell you why:

06:42.470 --> 06:44.271
his uncle is dead
and his father is

06:44.304 --> 06:46.106
headed for prison
or the grave.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.609
Yeah. I bet you wish
it was Dad instead.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.644
(distant indistinct chatter)

06:50.678 --> 06:52.145
Nice, Isabela.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.781
What? You pushed him
over the edge

06:53.814 --> 06:55.616
and that's why he ended up
in the hospital.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.917
You should have been the one
with the heart attack.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.118
(dramatic music)

06:58.151 --> 06:59.987
But I guess you need a heart

07:00.020 --> 07:02.456
for that to actually happen.
(phone clicks)

07:06.126 --> 07:09.129
-Agent Truesdale.
-Thank you.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.775
What was that about?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.911
Colonel Cortez briefed me
on what happened in Chicago.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.079
Your report seems to be
missing some info.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.116
Cortez claims that
you lunged after D'Avila

07:29.149 --> 07:31.619
and your lack of control
led to his escape.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.753
Again.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.088
(grunts)
(blows land)

07:35.122 --> 07:37.858
Everything that happened
in Chicago was by the book.

07:37.891 --> 07:42.496
So unless Cortez has
evidence to the contrary...

07:42.530 --> 07:45.165
I'll take your word
for it this time.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.201
Cortez has a lead
on D'Avila in Juarez.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.937
Guero won't step foot
across the border.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.104
He's a dead man if he does.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.640
You had your shot at him.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.842
Now Cortez is going
to follow this lead,

07:54.875 --> 07:57.978
and you're gonna give him
some breathing room.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.780
Yes, ma'am.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.516
(soft dramatic music)

08:02.550 --> 08:05.819
*

08:05.853 --> 08:07.320
Hey.
Did she sideline you?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.822
Damn near.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.024
Cortez is her
new golden boy now.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.960
What are you gonna do?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.129
Throw the Hail Mary and pray
like hell somebody catches it.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.000
*

08:20.033 --> 08:21.735
I would have thought Camila
would have been

08:21.769 --> 08:24.204
less cavalier
about this meeting,

08:24.237 --> 08:27.040
especially seeing the trouble
you went through to get it.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.709
Yeah. I'm sorry.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.377
She had to take the call.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.080
It's family.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.983
But you're not her blood.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.987
How did you manage to claw
your way out of Culiacán?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.923
A dead boyfriend,

08:42.956 --> 08:43.924
his gun,

08:43.957 --> 08:45.893
and an opportunity.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.161
(soft chuckle)

08:48.195 --> 08:49.763
That sounds like
more teeth than claw.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.232
What was the opportunity?

08:52.265 --> 08:54.902
-Camila.
-So she is family?

08:54.935 --> 08:58.205
What about you?
Where do you come from?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.873
Here and there.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.244
I tell you everything
and you tell me nothing.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.414
I guess Camila hasn't taught
you everything, has she?

09:07.447 --> 09:10.250
(phone buzzing)

09:11.318 --> 09:13.253
(speaking Spanish)

09:13.286 --> 09:15.422
(phone buzzing)

09:15.455 --> 09:17.290
Go ahead, take the call.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.258
Gracias.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.028
(phone buzzing)

09:21.061 --> 09:22.796
Hello?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
ALONZO: Teresa Mendoza.
This is Agent Loya.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.600
What do you want?

09:26.634 --> 09:28.101
ALONZO: You met me
with Agent Finnerman.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.536
I was Guero's handler.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.972
Guero's in danger.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.107
You know where he is?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.209
ALONZO: He was spotted
in Juarez.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.045
If Guero stays in Mexico,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.080
I think we both know
his days are numbered.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.248
(gentle music)

09:41.281 --> 09:43.751
(dramatic whooshing)

09:43.784 --> 09:46.386
(soft music)

09:46.419 --> 09:48.055
Our offer's still on the table

09:48.088 --> 09:50.557
if you choose to cooperate
against Camila.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.225
(whispering)
Keep talking.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.293
TERESA: Hello?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.829
Come on, Teresa.

09:55.863 --> 09:56.964
Let's keep talking.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.967
(dramatic music pounds)

10:00.000 --> 10:01.902
(soft music)

10:01.935 --> 10:04.772
*

10:04.805 --> 10:09.242
(phone case snapping)

10:09.276 --> 10:11.144
*

10:11.178 --> 10:13.146
(phone case drops)

10:13.180 --> 10:14.848
*

10:14.882 --> 10:17.184
Thank you.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.187
We didn't catch it.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.055
And now she's
ditched the burner.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.197
Once you've
got the metric ton,

10:30.230 --> 10:31.699
you won't have
a problem

10:31.732 --> 10:34.101
compensating
for our asking price.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.936
Why would I pay more per key
than what I'm paying now?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.938
Those numbers
don't add up for me.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.439
TERESA: They will.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.508
Once you handle
the product right.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.977
You have a suggestion,
Miss Mendoza?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.478
You make money
by running product

10:45.512 --> 10:47.214
through your
private jet company.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.317
You save money by cleaning it
through your hotels.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.786
Those numbers make sense,

10:52.820 --> 10:53.954
but what is coming in doesn't.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.389
(soft dramatic music)

10:56.423 --> 11:00.828
You're selling weaker product
for 80 grand a kilo, right?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.063
If you buy from us,
you can charge 130.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.732
I charge based on my market.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.501
Your customers will
pay for what we have.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.739
Either they buy from you,
or Camila,

11:11.772 --> 11:14.708
but there's only one way
both of you get paid.

11:14.742 --> 11:18.045
*

11:18.078 --> 11:19.679
My understanding is
that El Santo

11:19.713 --> 11:22.549
only deals with people
he considers cult members.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.717
Yeah, that's right.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.486
So you've met him?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.521
I went to Bolivia.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.590
There won't be a problem
with the supply.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.695
I'll give you 3 million
for 100 keys.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.731
If all goes well
with my customers,

11:37.765 --> 11:42.102
I'll take the rest of it
and deliver 27 million.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.303
CAMILA: Good.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.274
But I'm gonna need that sum
to be rolled out in payments.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.209
DEVON: You can't
launder that amount?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.879
Well, I just
changed accountants.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.847
My associates don't
hold that much cash.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.049
I handled money in Culiacán.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.018
Maybe I can help to find a way.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.589
*

12:02.622 --> 12:05.893
Changing dollars
on a street corner, Teresa,

12:05.926 --> 12:08.728
is not what
Mr. Finch had in mind.

12:08.762 --> 12:13.200
Would you please step away
while I finish my business?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
Excuse me.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.939
You know, she learns fast,

12:18.972 --> 12:20.941
but she's overeager,
as you can see.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.777
The 27 million will be handled.

12:23.811 --> 12:30.818
*

12:34.187 --> 12:35.355
Thank you.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.658
(speaking Spanish)

12:38.691 --> 12:39.960
Y próspera.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.428
(glasses clink)
Salúd.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.396
Salúd.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.900
It's a pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Finch.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.802
I'll expect your call.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.406
(soft brooding music)

12:53.440 --> 12:56.609
Who the hell do you think
you are to talk to me that way?

12:56.643 --> 12:59.246
You want to
tell me about my business?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.413
You know nothing.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.450
And you want to run an empire.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.353
I am the only reason
you exist, Teresa.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.088
You would be rotting
in a pit somewhere

13:08.121 --> 13:09.656
if it weren't because of me.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.592
And you want to usurp
a meeting I'm running?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.527
This is your business.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.930
I'm here to help, to learn.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.967
Then learn to be quiet.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.770
You think you're
selling Devon on a good deal?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.806
You're just too young
and too ignorant

13:26.840 --> 13:28.275
to see what he's buying.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.445
It's not your mind
he's after, Teresa.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.014
Look at me.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.986
(speaking Spanish)

13:41.421 --> 13:44.858
Don't let your ego
tell you otherwise.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.659
And I closed this deal,

13:46.693 --> 13:50.463
despite your interruptions,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.399
not because of them.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.504
(footsteps recede)

13:59.006 --> 14:01.241
DEVON: Miss Mendoza.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.344
I see Camila's
on the go again.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.913
She's not usually like this.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.580
She's lucky she has
a partner like you

14:07.614 --> 14:09.016
to take some of the load off.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.650
Thank you.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.352
Your analysis of
my operation was on point.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.987
You've done your homework
on me.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.523
-(soft laugh)
-As much as can be done.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.591
It's a pleasure doing business
with you, Miss Mendoza.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.759
The pleasure was mine.

How may I help you?

15:14.181 --> 15:16.783
Yeah, this is Camila Vargas
for Mr. Cole Van Awken.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.785
WOMAN: He's having lunch with
his wife--is this an emergency?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.820
No.
No, don't interrupt him

16:16.509 --> 16:18.378
He's a sicario from Culiacán.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.447
Okay, when it gets to
the next floor, let's separate.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.049
Fine.

Pedro is not my child.
You are.

Señor Vargas.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.000
Señor Gobernador.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.802
And you have already
disrespected me

We know Cortez sent you.

23:13.325 --> 23:16.729
You know it's my job
to protect Camila Vargas.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.230
And you also know
what's gonna happen to you

23:18.264 --> 23:19.799
if you don't start talking.

23:19.832 --> 23:23.235
Where is Cortez?
And how can we find him?

23:23.269 --> 23:25.772
(speaking Spanish)

23:27.607 --> 23:30.610

Is that it?

23:44.256 --> 23:47.259
(laughs)

23:47.293 --> 23:51.063
A woman
will never break me.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.099
Perra.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.300
Enough.

23:58.471 --> 24:01.440
(suspenseful music pounds)

24:01.474 --> 24:04.010
Last chance.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.512
Where is Cortez?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.620
Give me the gun.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.290
Go to the car.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.962
(suspenseful music)

24:22.995 --> 24:27.199
*

24:27.233 --> 24:28.968
So,

24:29.001 --> 24:31.804
you thought a woman
would never break you?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.042
My whole life,

24:36.075 --> 24:39.846
men have underestimated me.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.683
They told me
I wasn't good enough.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.052
And you're right.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.320
I'm not good.

24:48.354 --> 24:51.290
But unfortunately for you,

24:51.323 --> 24:53.192
in this business,

24:53.225 --> 24:56.896
bad is a good thing.

24:59.932 --> 25:00.867
(pistol fires)

25:00.900 --> 25:02.769

(cheers)

25:16.048 --> 25:18.150
-(cheers)
-What up?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.752
My turn.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.353
(hip-hop music playing)

25:21.387 --> 25:23.155
I'm tired of
the pinche cartel bullshit.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.191
Yo, I could stay in Texas,
and no one would give a shit.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.093
So, like, run away?
What about LA?

25:27.126 --> 25:28.828
Oh, my gosh. Let's go.
Let's do it.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.529
Wait a second, wait a second.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.998
I've got my own plan to get out.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.199
I'm gonna study
architecture at Cornell,

25:33.232 --> 25:35.001
be the next Frank Gehry.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.703
You know, New York's
cold as hell,

25:36.736 --> 25:38.771
but at least I'm
far away from Sinaloa.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.406
-I got the grades for Cornell.
-You do?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.875
PEDRO: Aw. (laughs)
-Coming with me?

25:42.909 --> 25:44.310
(kisses)

25:46.579 --> 25:48.447
Your dad's El Jefe now, so you
know what's gonna happen to me?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.117
I get zero, and Boaz doesn't
even call the shots.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.953
Princesa's dad is gonna
kick me to the curb like basura.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.888
So now my dad's
the bad guy, pendejo?

25:55.922 --> 25:56.856
-Yeah.
-Hey-hey-hey, hey.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.124
Primo, rela--

PEDRO: (laughs)
-Come on, Isabela.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.766
What the hell is your problem?

26:09.836 --> 26:11.771
You know,
when Pedro gets trashed,

26:11.804 --> 26:13.139
he gets all Kanye and shit,

26:13.172 --> 26:14.440
so don't listen to him.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.108
Everyone's so messed up.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.810
My mom and my dad...

26:17.844 --> 26:19.879
I'm not on that list, am I?

26:19.912 --> 26:23.149
Never. But that asshole
Pedro's number three.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.184
Yeah.
Screw him.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.922
It's Isabela.
She's in Dallas.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.324
I need to get to her.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.794
Cortez is trying to kill you.
You can't be in the streets.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.161
My daughter needs me.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.629
Let's go.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.832
Go!

27:32.184 --> 27:34.653
You're being hunted.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.123
It's not a good idea
to be out in plain sight.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.191
I don't care.
I have to help my daughter.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.561
Isabela is using drugs, Teresa.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.163
The irony is not lost on me.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.865
TERESA: She's a teenager.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.400
Kids try things.
She'll grow out of it.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.636
Not Isabela.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.339
I've never seen
her behave like this.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.842
I would tear down
everything I've built

27:55.875 --> 27:58.010
in order to
protect her innocence.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.846
You can't help her
if you're dead.

27:59.879 --> 28:04.216
Well, then it's a good thing
I have you to protect me.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.720

28:12.759 --> 28:14.894
Camila, are you all right?

28:14.927 --> 28:17.029
CAMILA: Right now, I'm more
concerned about our daughter.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.397
She's in Dallas.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.366
She's in some kind of trouble.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.268
EPI: She's with
the Jimenez boys.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.535
And you were right.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.104
I didn't pay enough attention

28:25.137 --> 28:27.073
to Isabela, and
I lost control of her.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.242
You've lost control of more
than your daughter, mi amor.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.578
And because of
your carelessness,

28:32.611 --> 28:34.280
now I have blood on my hands.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.715
I don't understand.
Did you kill someone?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.517
The man Cortez
dispatched to kill me,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.419
once again.

28:40.452 --> 28:44.390
(speaking Spanish)

CAMILA: You chose a deranged
butcher as your partner,

28:47.459 --> 28:49.762
and you're shocked
he challenged your authority?

28:49.796 --> 28:52.298
You have lots of flaws,

28:52.331 --> 28:56.302
but stupidity and weakness
are not on the list.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.604
Put your house in order,
Epifanio.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.439

out of my business.

-Who the hell are you?

30:35.101 --> 30:36.502
That's Teresa, my associate.
Come on.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.537
I'm not going anywhere.

CAMILA: You texted me that you
were in trouble, and I'm here.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.641
Or you just wanted
to humiliate me?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.310

36:35.227 --> 36:37.396
* Known about you

36:37.429 --> 36:39.865
(speaking Spanish)

36:39.898 --> 36:44.169
* And now I can't see

36:44.202 --> 36:46.372
*

36:46.405 --> 36:49.375
* Knowing that you got to me

36:49.408 --> 36:52.544
*

36:52.578 --> 36:54.380
* It's just a losing game

36:54.413 --> 36:57.583
I was stationed in Juarez
at the beginning of my career.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.752
So many memories,
so many women.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.289
I've met many men like you,
Colonel Cortez.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.957
Your violence
doesn't make you special.

37:05.991 --> 37:10.729
It will feel special when
I tell Epifanio you're dead,

37:10.762 --> 37:13.765
to do what he could not
bring himself to do.

37:13.799 --> 37:18.270
I will bring a very special
gift to my compadre:

37:18.304 --> 37:20.306
his freedom.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.708
*

37:22.741 --> 37:24.776
(siren chirping)

37:24.810 --> 37:28.880
(sirens wailing)

37:28.914 --> 37:35.721
*

37:35.754 --> 37:38.724
MAN: You're surrounded.
Don't move, Cortez.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.991
Do a sweep of the lot.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.827
-Find Vargas' car.
-Yep.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.128
Mrs. Vargas is under the custody

37:43.161 --> 37:44.663
of the Mexican government.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.765
That's not how
this works, Colonel.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.734
She's on American soil,

37:48.767 --> 37:51.670
and we got a tip she's engaging
in a drug deal at this location.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.439
Eyes on the car.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.773
Sit tight, Colonel.

37:54.806 --> 38:01.813
*

38:17.696 --> 38:21.266
Look what we have here.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.302
Camila Vargas,
you're under arrest.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.204
* Just breathe

38:26.237 --> 38:29.441
* Breathe, breathe

38:29.475 --> 38:34.546
* You out

38:34.580 --> 38:37.282
* Out

38:37.315 --> 38:40.118
* And breathe, breathe

38:40.151 --> 38:44.022
(priest continuing in Spanish)

39:01.673 --> 39:08.680
*

39:39.110 --> 39:40.712
