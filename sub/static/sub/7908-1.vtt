01:01.663 --> 01:04.291
<i>When she landed at the ball,</i>
<i>she found herself...</i>

01:04.366 --> 01:07.698
<i>most impertinently surrounded</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:12.398
<i>There was Alf Mason,</i>

<i>Bill Jukes,</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:19.443
<i>And worst of them all,</i>

01:19.512 --> 01:23.812
Hook, with eyes blue
as forget-me-nots,

01:23.883 --> 01:28.444
save when he clawed your belly
with the iron hook he has...

01:28.520 --> 01:31.512
instead of a right hand,
at which time...

01:31.590 --> 01:35.117
his eyes turn red.

01:36.228 --> 01:38.161
"Girlie," said Hook,

01:38.229 --> 01:40.493
"we have come
for ye glass slippers."

01:40.565 --> 01:44.524
Who be you to order me about

<i>But there was nothing there,</i>

02:57.700 --> 03:02.899
<i>Mr. Darling was a banker</i>

<i>Mrs. Darling was the loveliest</i>
<i>lady in Bloomsbury...</i>

03:06.709 --> 03:10.872
<i>with a sweet, mocking mouth</i>
<i>that had one kiss on it...</i>

03:10.946 --> 03:12.971
<i>that Wendy could never get.</i>

03:13.048 --> 03:15.175
<i>Though there it was,</i>

03:15.250 --> 03:19.310
<i>perfectly conspicuous</i>
<i>on the right-hand corner.</i>

03:20.555 --> 03:23.046
<i>And sometimes there</i>
<i>was Aunt Millicent...</i>

03:23.124 --> 03:26.321
<i>who felt a dog for a nurse</i>
<i>lowered the whole tone</i>
<i>of the neighborhood.</i>

03:26.394 --> 03:29.556
All right, all right,
all right, all right.
Less noise.

03:29.629 --> 03:32.894
- Let's settle down.
This is not a farm.
- [Whines]

03:32.966 --> 03:35.662
- <i>[Millicent]</i>
<i>Bravo, George. Bravo.</i>
- Wendy's turn.

03:35.735 --> 03:39.295
Wendy must tell a story.
** [Piano]

- Heavens.
- Hook!

03:47.880 --> 03:52.441
- Hook?
- Hook, whose eyes turn red
as he guts you.

03:52.517 --> 03:55.350
Upon my soul, how children
are educated nowadays.

03:55.420 --> 03:58.320
- [Chuckles]
- I'm afraid I am not
learned at all, Aunt.

03:58.388 --> 04:01.186
- But I do know a thing or two
about pirates.
- Ooh.

04:01.258 --> 04:05.627
My unfulfilled ambition is
to write a great novel in three
parts about my adventures.

04:05.696 --> 04:08.596
- What adventures?
- I've yet to have them,

04:08.664 --> 04:10.598
but they will be
perfectly thrilling.

04:10.666 --> 04:14.261
But, child, novelists
are not highly thought of
in good society.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.829
And there is nothing
so difficult to marry as a novelist.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.702
- Marry?
- Marry?

04:19.774 --> 04:23.335
- Marry?
- But, Aunt, Wendy is not yet 13.

04:25.113 --> 04:27.877
Walk toward me, dear,

04:44.964 --> 04:47.296
Mm, yes.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.960
Oh, it's quite as I expected.

04:50.035 --> 04:53.163
Wendy possesses a woman's chin.

04:55.474 --> 04:59.341
Have you not noticed?
Observe her mouth.

04:59.410 --> 05:02.379
<i>There, hidden</i>
<i>in the right-hand corner,</i>

05:04.382 --> 05:06.043
is that a kiss?

05:06.117 --> 05:08.176
<i>[Mrs. Darling Gasps]</i>

05:08.252 --> 05:11.084
- A kiss?
- Like Mother's kiss.

05:11.154 --> 05:15.215
- <i>[Millicent]</i>
<i>A hidden kiss.</i>
- But what is it for?

05:16.559 --> 05:19.186
It is for the greatest
adventure of all.

05:19.261 --> 05:21.422
They that find it...

05:21.497 --> 05:24.660
have slipped in and out of heaven.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.667
Find what?

05:26.735 --> 05:30.101
The one the kiss belongs to.

05:31.272 --> 05:33.206
My Wendy...

05:33.274 --> 05:36.402
a woman.
Almost a woman.

05:36.477 --> 05:38.775
She must spend less time
with her brothers...

05:38.846 --> 05:41.109
<i>and more time with me.</i>
[All Gasp]

05:41.181 --> 05:43.547
She must have her own room.

make small talk with
your superiors at the bank.

Yes, Mother,

Please, Mother.

Your father is a brave man.

the special kiss to face
his colleagues tonight.

10:50.527 --> 10:52.654
Father? Brave?

10:54.797 --> 10:58.164
There are many
different kinds of bravery.

10:58.233 --> 11:02.169
There's the bravery of thinking
of others before oneself.

11:02.237 --> 11:07.230
Now, your father has never
brandished a sword nor fired
a pistol, thank heavens.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.044
But he's made many sacrifices
for his family...

11:13.114 --> 11:16.014
and put away many dreams.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.779
Where did he put them?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.116
He put them in a drawer.

11:21.188 --> 11:26.056
And sometimes, late at night,
we take them out and admire them.

11:27.727 --> 11:31.060
<i>But it gets harder and harder</i>
<i>to close the drawer.</i>

11:32.965 --> 11:34.955
He does.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.695
And that is why he is brave.

11:42.407 --> 11:44.567
And remember, every cloud
has a silver lining.

11:44.642 --> 11:48.100
Oh.
Oh. No, it's snowing.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.976

I wasn't crying
about mothers.

I live with boys... the Lost Boys.
They are well named.

Who are they?

17:26.884 --> 17:29.647
Children who fall out of their prams
when the nurse is not looking.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.347
If they are not claimed in seven days,
they are sent to the Neverland.

17:32.422 --> 17:36.825
- Are there girls too?
- Girls are much too clever
to fall out of their prams.

17:36.893 --> 17:41.625
Peter, it is perfectly lovely
the way you talk about girls.

17:44.366 --> 17:47.529
I should like to give you...

17:47.602 --> 17:49.535

How old are you, Peter?
Quite young.

18:40.716 --> 18:44.447
- Don't you know?
- I ran away.

18:44.520 --> 18:49.422
One night, I heard my mother
and father talking of what
I was to be when I became a man.

18:51.493 --> 18:55.327
So I ran away to Kensington
Gardens and I met Tink.
[Squealing]

18:55.397 --> 18:58.332

- Tinker Bell.

- But there's no such thing as...
- Don't say that.

Every time somebody
says that, a fairy
somewhere falls down dead.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.733
And I shall never find her
if she's dead.

19:11.811 --> 19:15.542

there's a fairy in this room.

to be charming.
