WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:07.098
All right, Hyde! Your dad's apartment
is the perfect place for a party.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.767
It's already trashed.

00:09.843 --> 00:14.371
Hey, even if half the people we invited
show up, this party's gonna rock.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.642
- Did you find the cups?
- Nope. Even better.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.651
A plastic tube and a funnel.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.984
All this and a dirty funnel?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.524
Merry Christmas to me.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.719
Yeah, we don't even
have to worry about germs...

00:27.794 --> 00:30.092
because even though our spit
backs up in the tube...

00:30.163 --> 00:32.256
the alcohol kills 'em.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.234
- We're leaving.
- So leaving.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.201
- Wait. You're leaving?
- Yeah, see...

00:37.270 --> 00:39.830
when I was a little girl,
I made a promise to myself.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.238
"Self," I said, "if you're ever
about to suck beer...

00:42.308 --> 00:45.106
out of a funnel
that might give you mono, don't."

00:45.178 --> 00:48.341
So bye-bye.

00:48.415 --> 00:52.146
All right. Kelso, I'm gonna nix the funnel
on account of I think it repels women.

00:52.218 --> 00:58.179
Hey, any woman who doesn't appreciate
a nice funnel isn't much of a woman.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.553
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.825
- What's with the keg?
- Throwin' a little party.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.026
You know, 'tis the season
to get sloppy.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.569
- Well, uh...
- You're cool with this, right?

01:10.637 --> 01:13.936
Sure. Yeah. Cool dad.
That's me.

01:14.007 --> 01:17.067
Totally cool dad.

01:17.143 --> 01:20.135
Hey, listen.
Have a merry, uh, keg party.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.273
Mr. Hyde, you're the best.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.283
Yeah, you're the best.

01:25.351 --> 01:29.651
Will you be my daddy?
I'm not kidding.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.788
Seriously.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.193
- Oh, hey, Fez, can you grab this for me?
- Sure.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

01:51.077 --> 01:53.375
You know, Kelso,
four times is not funny.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.680
Um, yes, it is.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.686
<i>Guess who?</i>

02:01.754 --> 02:04.780
Eric, it's your mom!

02:04.858 --> 02:07.884
Oh, I'm not...

02:11.297 --> 02:13.561
Oh, you're caroling.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.534
That is so... odd.

02:17.604 --> 02:21.335
Well, um, happy holidays.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.807
Look what I brought.
Mistletoe!

02:23.877 --> 02:26.004
Uh-oh.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.274
Uh-uh.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.282
Uh-oh!

02:30.350 --> 02:32.147
Uh-oh!

02:36.723 --> 02:40.386
Now, Steven, I brought some
beautiful Christmas ornaments...

02:40.460 --> 02:44.726
to hang on your...
antenna.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.027
Ah, Mrs. Forman, you're not
checking up on me, are you?

02:47.100 --> 02:51.594
No, no, no. I'm just spreading
a little holiday cheer.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.662
Dusty.

02:53.740 --> 02:58.006
Oh. Oh, and this blanket,
it needs a nice Christmas washing.

02:58.077 --> 03:03.242
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
That's Bud's Christmas stool.

03:03.316 --> 03:07.582
Very sentimental. If anybody
touches it, he just goes nuts, so...

03:07.654 --> 03:13.559
Huh. Well, um, I don't
quite believe you, but okay.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.924
Okay.

03:15.995 --> 03:21.695
So, um, Bud left you boys
here unsupervised?

03:21.768 --> 03:24.202
Oh, salami in the couch.

03:25.738 --> 03:28.901
Now, that's... sanitary.

03:32.078 --> 03:37.448
Okay! Okay, then, um,
why don't you boys hang up those angels?

03:37.517 --> 03:39.917
And, um, Eric,
come in here...

03:39.986 --> 03:45.151
and help me with the traditional
holiday floor wax.

03:45.225 --> 03:50.253
Mom, seriously, we're okay.
You can go, really.

04:01.941 --> 04:05.843
<i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>Fez is making ice.</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:47.112
Ooh. Listen to this.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.120
"Corner Him Under the Mistletoe:

04:49.188 --> 04:51.418
Eight Ways to Trick
a Guy Into a Relationship."

04:51.491 --> 04:53.721
I love the holidays.

04:53.793 --> 04:58.594
Yeah, hanging your stocking, putting cookies
out for Santa, setting a man trap.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.829
Mmm, Christmas.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.197
You know, this'll be the first year I
celebrate Christmas without a boyfriend.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.400
And Jesus wept.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.345
So here's my new plan
for the year:

05:13.413 --> 05:18.112
Buy some really cute tops,
fly to Hollywood and marry Lee Majors.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.448
Make fun of that.
I dare you.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.045
Jackie, there are so many ways
to make fun of that...

05:23.122 --> 05:25.283
I don't even know
where to start.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.292
It's like choosing
your favorite jelly bean.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.694
Donna, be nice to me.
I'm lonely.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.824
I mean, okay,
if there were mistletoe over me right now...

05:34.901 --> 05:36.892
who would kiss me?

05:36.969 --> 05:39.301
No one. That's who.

05:39.372 --> 05:42.068
Being alone isn't that bad.

05:42.141 --> 05:44.234
It's a great opportunity
to get to know yourself...

05:44.310 --> 05:46.244
and be comfortable
with who you are.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.246
Donna, I already love myself.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.475
I just wanna
French someone.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.046
I miss my funnel.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.462
Eric, drink.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.463
Okay.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.728
If I was Tattoo,
and I lived on Fantasy Island...

06:08.801 --> 06:11.269
my fantasy would be
to not be a midget.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.328
Am I right?

06:14.340 --> 06:16.570
Hmm.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.668
Eenie, meenie, miney, Forman.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.043
You know, Hyde, at first I thought
your dad was a real dirtbag...

06:25.118 --> 06:27.052
but I've come to realize
that there's a fine line...

06:27.120 --> 06:30.988
between dirtbag
and Father of the Year!

06:33.326 --> 06:35.317
Damn!

06:38.164 --> 06:40.928
Fellas, I have to be honest.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.993
I've never played quarters before,
so I probably stink.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.472
Oh, happy day! Eric.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.174
Man, this is the worst game
in the world.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.043
I'm so thirsty.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.981
Damn it! Eric, drink!

06:59.519 --> 07:03.478
I mean, he lives
on Fantasy Island, man...

07:03.556 --> 07:05.547
and he's a midget!

07:05.625 --> 07:07.616
It's so obvious.

07:10.930 --> 07:15.367
Hmm. Mmmm, Forman.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.894
Does anyone else
feel kind of woozy?

07:20.540 --> 07:23.839
Oh, what the hell, man?

07:26.045 --> 07:30.106
If I make this shot,
I promise I will not pick you, Eric.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.576
I pick you, Eric.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.646
It's fun to lie.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.861
Donna, that's Fireman Rob
and Fireman Dean.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.831
- They're firemen!
- Jackie, they're, like, 40.

07:46.899 --> 07:49.697
Whatever. They're firemen!

07:49.769 --> 07:52.033
Two hot firemen in a bar.

07:52.104 --> 07:56.097
This is just like that play I wrote.
Okay, give me five minutes.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.109
I'll pick the one I want,
and you can have the other.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.305
Hello! I'm dating someone.
Eric.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.644
Donna, Dean can
bench-press a keg.

08:03.716 --> 08:08.619
- Eric can't even bench-press a cup.
- He can too.

08:12.091 --> 08:15.060
Rob, Dean, this is Donna.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.796
So, what do you girls do?

08:25.872 --> 08:29.740
That's funny you should ask.
We, uh, go to high school!

08:32.144 --> 08:36.240
- Any outside interests?
- Uh-huh. High school guys!

08:47.693 --> 08:50.355
Kelso, it's fine.
I'm not that drunk.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.130
I just...

08:54.200 --> 08:57.829
I just can't walk... or see.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.901
Man, that was...
That was a great party!

09:02.975 --> 09:06.103
You know... You know who
doesn't like parties? Red.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.940
"I'm Red!

09:15.688 --> 09:19.124
I don't like parties...

09:19.191 --> 09:22.627
'cause I'm a big,
bald, party pooper!"

09:30.603 --> 09:33.572
Uh-oh.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.836
Uh-oh.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.614
Son of a bitch!

09:46.886 --> 09:49.650
Eric, when did you
eat spaghetti?

10:00.933 --> 10:04.232
I knew something
was going on at Bud's.

10:04.303 --> 10:09.366
When I went over there,
the only thing in the fridge... olives.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.306
And poor Fez had ice
in his pants.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.380
My head hurts.

10:18.450 --> 10:22.079
That's your brain trying
to comprehend its own stupidity.

10:27.192 --> 10:31.219
I mean, what kind of parent leaves
a bunch of teenagers alone with a keg?

10:31.296 --> 10:33.662
A fun one?

10:33.732 --> 10:38.169
Hey, Jim Beam, can it.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.262
Red, you need to have
a talk with Bud.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.899
No.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.966
Eric's home now.

10:45.043 --> 10:50.845
And what goes on between Bud and Steven
is between Bud and Steven.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.941
He's just not a good dad.

10:53.018 --> 10:55.418
Well, you know what?
I agree.

10:55.487 --> 10:58.354
So, I think we should
get in the car...

10:58.423 --> 11:02.382
pick up Steven and move him
back in with us and feed him...

11:03.629 --> 11:06.826
and... and clothe him...

11:06.899 --> 11:08.833
and love him.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.892
No.

11:13.305 --> 11:17.469
I'm not loving anybody
that I'm not legally required to.

11:23.582 --> 11:26.483
Fine. I'll call Bud.

11:26.551 --> 11:28.485
And, Eric,
I'll deal with you later.

11:28.553 --> 11:30.544
Thank you.

11:35.994 --> 11:38.485
Mommy, I don't feel so good.

11:38.563 --> 11:41.760
If you're gonna get sick again,
why don't you throw up under the tree...

11:41.833 --> 11:44.597
because Christmas is ruined!

11:49.441 --> 11:51.671
Oh, no.

11:56.181 --> 11:59.082
So, tell me more
about the big ladder thingy.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.348
Oh, the cherry picker?
Funny story. True story.

12:05.557 --> 12:09.118
Okay, Jackie, this is a nightmare,
and we're leaving.

12:10.295 --> 12:14.026
Okay. Look, Donna,
you have a boyfriend, I don't.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.590
And maybe I don't want
to sit home alone every night.

12:16.668 --> 12:20.900
And if somebody doesn't tell me I'm cute
in the next five minutes, I'm gonna scream!

12:23.008 --> 12:25.670
Hi. Sorry. My friend
was being a wet blanket.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.907
Well, maybe I
should talk to her.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.245
I mean, a wet blanket's
a fireman's best friend.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.079
Boy, something about you
is so familiar.

12:38.156 --> 12:40.090
I get that all the time.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.092
See from the right,
I look like Gidget...

12:42.160 --> 12:44.287
and from the left,
I look like Elizabeth Taylor.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.526
- Neat, huh?
- Nah. It's...

12:47.599 --> 12:49.567
Oh, it's your laugh!

12:49.634 --> 12:53.627
You know, I used to date a girl with the same
laugh, but, uh, it was 20 years ago.

12:53.705 --> 12:56.606
She dumped me and married
some rich lawyer.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.109
Burk... Burkhart!
That was it.

12:59.177 --> 13:04.080
Oh, my God, that's my name!
And my dad's a rich lawyer!

13:04.149 --> 13:06.140
Oh, my God!

13:09.654 --> 13:12.350
So, Jackie, was this
in the play you wrote?

13:23.402 --> 13:25.495
Kitty, why are you smoking?

13:28.006 --> 13:30.133
It's my Yuletide cigarette.

13:32.611 --> 13:38.015
To celebrate all the children who spend
black Christmases with bad parents.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.848
Kitty, put that out.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.222
Back off, Grinch.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.855
Hey, Red. Hey, Kitty.

13:54.933 --> 13:57.231
Bad parent.

13:58.403 --> 14:01.338
- Is she all right?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

14:01.406 --> 14:04.000
Uh, sit down, Bud.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.203
Kitty, sweetheart...

14:07.379 --> 14:09.438
why don't you leave us
alone for a minute?

14:10.615 --> 14:13.140
A boy can't live on olives.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.680
Bud...

14:21.660 --> 14:24.220
Eric just came back from your place
falling-down drunk.

14:25.363 --> 14:27.524
He threw up on my shoes.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.529
Now, what were you thinking,
leaving kids alone with a keg?

14:32.604 --> 14:37.701
Look, Red, I've never
really been a dad before.

14:37.776 --> 14:42.008
I-I'm just trying to...
I don't know...

14:42.080 --> 14:44.014
take it easy,
be his friend.

14:44.082 --> 14:46.915
Why would you be friends
with a 17-year-old?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.544
They're idiots.

14:50.622 --> 14:56.288
Bud, being a teenager
is like being in combat.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.625
One minute you're
crawling around half blind...

14:58.697 --> 15:01.325
the next, you're looking
for your own foot.

15:02.501 --> 15:06.938
- Follow me?
- Not really.

15:07.005 --> 15:10.907
I was a conscientious...
Canadian.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.271
Well, if you weren't chicken
and you did fight...

15:16.348 --> 15:18.441
who would you want
as your lieutenant, me or you?

15:18.517 --> 15:22.954
Well, you, 'cause you're mean and scary.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.548
That's right.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.355
Steven doesn't need
another friend, Bud.

15:29.427 --> 15:31.657
Steven needs somebody
to ride his ass.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.695
He may not like it.
He may not thank you for it.

15:35.767 --> 15:41.330
He may... do impressions of you
behind your back.

15:46.845 --> 15:50.008
He thinks he's
so damn funny.

15:52.350 --> 15:57.049
But the point is, he'll know right from wrong
because you did your job.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.885
Huh.

16:02.561 --> 16:07.555
Bread, ham, bananas, milk. Because
there are four food groups, Bud! Four!

16:18.944 --> 16:21.003
I am so grossed out.

16:21.079 --> 16:26.039
I need a Calgon bath, a facial,
some Tater Tots and some Jean Naté.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.011
- This night was the worst.
- I know.

16:31.089 --> 16:33.853
I mean, I am not
gonna find love in a bar.

16:33.925 --> 16:37.725
All I'm gonna find there
are guys who used to French my mom.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.964
Just this morning, I was playing
with My Pretty Ponies.

16:42.033 --> 16:44.024
Look what you've done to me!
Look!

16:44.102 --> 16:49.267
Me? I'm not the one who hooked up
with the volunteer fire department.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.572
I am never gonna
meet anybody...

16:52.644 --> 16:56.080
and I'm never, ever
gonna feel better, ever.

16:59.985 --> 17:04.080
Jackie, when you're sad, you look
exactly like Mary Tyler Moore.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.959
Oh, my God!
Donna, I do.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.327
I am gonna
make it after all!

17:15.834 --> 17:17.825
Damn!

17:23.642 --> 17:25.666
Okay, everybody,
here we go.

17:25.743 --> 17:29.373
Now, if I catch on fire,
you promise to put me out?

17:29.447 --> 17:31.972
Well, I'm sure someone will.
Right, guys?

17:35.320 --> 17:37.311
Okay, great.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.415
Steven, I gotta tal...

17:40.492 --> 17:43.484
- What the hell are you doing?
- It is complicated.

17:43.561 --> 17:47.019
All right. That's it.
Party's over. Everybody out.

17:47.098 --> 17:49.066
What the hell
are you doing, Bud?

17:49.134 --> 17:51.898
Steven, this place
is a madhouse.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.201
There are kids all over the place,
and this guy could've burst into flames.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.199
We'll never know now,
will we, Bud?

18:03.348 --> 18:07.682
Look, Eric went home so drunk,
he threw up all over Red's shoes.

18:10.955 --> 18:13.287
- That's good stuff.
- No, it's not good stuff.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.292
And you know what else?
It's forbidden.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.385
So, what, are you trying
to play father now?

18:17.462 --> 18:19.862
I'm not playing.
I am your father.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.899
You wanna stay here,
you're gonna do what I tell you.

18:21.966 --> 18:24.434
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really!

18:24.502 --> 18:29.963
I'll be damned if you're gonna end up
looking for your own foot on my watch!

18:33.378 --> 18:37.838
Now, clean up all this crap, take the
trash out and eat a banana, dumb-ass!

18:49.394 --> 18:53.524
Now he's all strict.
I gotta do my homework...

18:53.598 --> 18:56.499
and he keeps talking
about nutrition.

18:58.636 --> 19:02.697
So, I guess what I'm
hearing from all this is...

19:03.808 --> 19:05.742
Hyde loves his daddy!

19:07.312 --> 19:10.440
- Shut up, Forman. I do not.
- Yes, you do!

19:10.515 --> 19:12.506
Yes, you do!

19:12.584 --> 19:15.519
And Daddy loves his little Hyde!

19:15.587 --> 19:19.785
And that's why he yells at him
and tucks him into bed...

19:19.858 --> 19:22.258
and puts on his little
footsie pajamas...

19:22.327 --> 19:24.625
and reads him
bedtime stories!

19:26.698 --> 19:29.690
Hey, thanks, Steven.
I'll take over from here.

19:34.839 --> 19:37.069
- Now, about last night...
- You know what, Dad?

19:37.142 --> 19:39.576
Uh, before you get started,
I know what you're gonna say.

19:39.644 --> 19:43.478
Oh, really?
What do you know?

19:43.548 --> 19:49.453
Um, that I was
irresponsible and stupid.

19:49.521 --> 19:55.084
And I have it on good authority that I...
may have called you something.

19:58.196 --> 20:03.395
Like, um,
"big, bald party pooper?"

20:06.604 --> 20:08.538
For instance.

20:08.606 --> 20:12.736
But the point is, Dad,
I'm really ashamed and sorry...

20:13.945 --> 20:16.140
and afraid.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.615
Hmm.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.551
Okay.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.611
Well, that covers it.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.691
Okay. Good talk.

20:32.597 --> 20:34.861
That's it?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.867
I get off scot-free?

20:36.935 --> 20:38.926
I mean, I learned
a valuable lesson?

20:45.276 --> 20:48.006
Look, Son,
you're grown up now.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.070
You know what you did wrong.

20:50.148 --> 20:55.108
And I am too tired to keep thinking up
new and exciting ways to punish you.

20:56.454 --> 20:59.912
So... Merry Christmas.

20:59.991 --> 21:03.119
Are you kidding me?

21:03.194 --> 21:06.254
I don't get in trouble, and you're
giving me a Christmas present?

21:07.365 --> 21:10.596
Oh, boy, this is
the best Christmas ever!

21:10.668 --> 21:13.296
Actually, you know,
this really smells.

21:13.371 --> 21:15.805
Yeah, those are my shoes
from last night.

21:21.279 --> 21:24.180
Clean 'em,
buff'em and shine 'em.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.847
Ho, ho, ho.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.346
Dumb-ass!

21:43.067 --> 21:45.058
Damn.

21:46.804 --> 21:48.738
Damn it!

21:51.509 --> 21:53.500
Oh, come on!
