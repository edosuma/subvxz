00:30.321 --> 00:32.573
I mean, what does a killer look like?

00:34.242 --> 00:35.368
I'm actually asking.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.204
Because we had no idea.

[Ani]
<i>We thought maybe Jessica had it in her,</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:57.222
Tyler.

00:58.391 --> 01:02.270
Clay again. Um, I'm not sure
if you got my messages last night, just...

01:03.229 --> 01:05.440

I'm picking you up today

01:06.024 --> 01:08.526

01:09.360 --> 01:10.360

01:11.112 --> 01:12.113
I'll see you soon.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.076
<i>But who?</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:21.581
Do the flowers make it seem
like we're trying too hard?

01:22.624 --> 01:26.336
A little. Are we flower people?
I feel like we're not flower people.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.587
We should just be us.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.221
Justin's home visit.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.723
The social worker is going to be here
any minute.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.684
That's today. Awesome.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.264
Do I have to be here for it?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.523
Clay, it's very important
that we show them

01:46.606 --> 01:49.484
that we're providing Justin
with a happy, healthy home environment.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.945
Are you... You still feel good
about all this, right?

01:52.487 --> 01:54.405
Oh, yeah. No, totally. I'm good. I...

01:55.156 --> 01:57.367
just had something I had to do.
I'll figure it out.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.872
Happy, healthy, got it. All good.

02:13.341 --> 02:16.636
[Ani] <i>Then the news bulletin went out.
You know the one I mean.</i>

02:16.719 --> 02:19.848
- They are particularly high strung today.
- Hey, Bryce was shot.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.183
- What?
- Yeah.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.978
The <i>Evergreen County Register</i> reported it
this morning.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.689
[Ani] <i>And suddenly,
there was only one person</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:28.772
<i>who came to mind.</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:30.399
Shot...

02:31.025 --> 02:32.026

02:32.527 --> 02:33.778
It's fucked up, right?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.698
[stammers] Don't say anything to them yet.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.449
- Believe me...
- I just...

02:39.492 --> 02:40.618
have to, uh...

02:41.077 --> 02:42.453
make a call real quick.

[Ani] <i> One person, one student at Liberty</i>

<i>who'd had it the worst
and had been through the most.</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.139
<i>And that was Tyler Down.</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:08.521
- Where's Clay?
- He had a family thing.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.293
He said he was going to pick me up
and we were gonna take care of everything.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.318
Well, I'm picking you up

03:13.401 --> 03:15.945
and we are taking care of everything,
so...

03:18.531 --> 03:20.658
I mean, I thought Clay was coming.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.370
Clay's not fucking coming, okay?
So where's the damn gun, Tyler?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.498
I don't have it.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.169
Look, I'll give it to Clay after school,
all right? I promise.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.129
- You don't have it?
- Not with me, no.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.881
Look.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.218
So, where is it?

03:38.927 --> 03:39.928
Uh...

03:41.512 --> 03:42.512
It's...

03:43.223 --> 03:44.223
hidden.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.184
In a safe place.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
Why do you want to get rid of it today?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.272
Because...

03:52.690 --> 03:53.733
I'm done with it.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.947
And I understand that you're sharing
a room now? Any issues there?

03:59.989 --> 04:00.989
No.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.325
I love having a roommate.

04:02.533 --> 04:06.955
Brother.
Brother-roommate type person is awesome.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.749
Do you and Justin have any interests
in common?

04:10.291 --> 04:11.501
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

Um...

04:21.928 --> 04:23.054
We also like robots.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.348
- Super cool.
- Yeah.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.645
[Ani] <i>So, we had to worry about Tyler
because, well,</i>

04:31.145 --> 04:33.564
<i>we'd been worrying about him
for quite some time.</i>

04:33.648 --> 04:35.191
- Hey.
- Where's Clay?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.944
He's still with the social worker.
What's going on?

04:38.653 --> 04:41.239
Tyler came up to me last night
and said he had a gun

04:41.322 --> 04:42.824
that he needed to get rid of.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.659
And this morning, we find out...

04:44.951 --> 04:46.160
- Bryce?
- Yeah.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.078
Jesus.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.558
[Ani] You don't think he would...
But he's been doing so well.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.918
- [Tony] Well, we thought so.
- I just don't believe it.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.087
Not Tyler.
I mean, what reason would he have?

04:56.170 --> 04:57.797
Did he have a reason last time?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.222
- What the fuck?
- I got this.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.307
[Dr. Singh] Mr. Padilla?

05:08.766 --> 05:09.684
Welcome back.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.311
We haven't seen you in a long time.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.604
Care to join me in my office
and explain why?

05:17.483 --> 05:19.110
Don't let him out of your sight.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.575
Why did we think Tyler had a gun?

05:26.993 --> 05:29.579
Well, because it wouldn't
have been the first time.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.957
You remember Spring Fling?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.209
The false alarm?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.049
[Ani] <i>Yeah, there was nothing false
about it.</i>

05:50.308 --> 05:51.392
[Clay] So...

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
- I stepped in front of him.
- In front of his gun?

05:55.855 --> 05:56.855
And...

05:56.898 --> 05:57.982
I asked him not to do it.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.901
Clay, that is insane.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.653
Yes, it was a really bad choice.

06:03.821 --> 06:04.821
That...

06:05.907 --> 06:07.158
I think I'd make again.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.118
Exactly the same way.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.495
You're a madman.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.289
I get it, you think it was wrong.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.292
I think it was stupid.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.087
And brave.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.715
But it doesn't mean
you have to be the hero all the time.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.050
It kind of does, though.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.219
Until we know he's okay.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.721
You've got to put on your own mask first.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.976

06:34.185 --> 06:36.437
you've got to put on your own mask first.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.649
- Is yours on?
- Sure.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.527
So, how can I help you with yours?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.281
[Ani] <i>Nothing happened back then,</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:51.369
<i>and everyone, Clay most of all,
dedicated themselves</i>

06:51.452 --> 06:52.954
<i>to helping Tyler get better.</i>

06:53.913 --> 06:55.415
<i>But you couldn't help but wonder</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:57.417
<i>what if Tyler had killed anyway?</i>

06:57.708 --> 07:00.044
<i>What if he killed Bryce?</i>

07:06.467 --> 07:10.513
Hey, Tyler. Could I see what you got
for number nine? I missed that one.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.557
- Yeah, totally.
- Good, I'll just...

07:12.640 --> 07:14.267
- [Tyler] I got it.
- Oh, sorry.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.811
- I didn't mean to...
- No, it's okay.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.860
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.095
Clay tells me you're both into robots.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.891
Yeah, totally.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.728

It's awesome.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.772
Well, it seems like
you two are getting along quite well.

08:02.148 --> 08:02.982
Yeah...

08:03.149 --> 08:03.983
for sure.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.444
And Matt and Lainie are so happy
to have you.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.070
They saved my life.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.780
All three of them.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.072
Well...

08:11.491 --> 08:13.326
parental rights are being resolved,

08:13.618 --> 08:17.705
but there was mention of a Seth Massey
in your file.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.123
Has he been in contact?

08:21.626 --> 08:25.171
Yeah, I haven't seen him
since I ran away last year.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.383
We gotta stop at the ATM on the way.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.969
What? No. Why?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.972
Because Jessica,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.933
she needs a fancy date after everything.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.687
Dude, what is wrong with you today?
We have a free pass for once.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.566
Tyler asked me and Tony
to get rid of another gun.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.820
Because he was quote "done with it."
And we think he might have it at school.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.616
- Fuck. You don't think that he...
- Look, I don't want to, but...

08:55.826 --> 08:58.829
Jessica's watching him next two periods,
but we gotta get there.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.631
[Ani] <i>And let's face it,</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:10.758

about Tyler</i>

09:10.841 --> 09:12.093
<i>because, well,</i>

09:13.511 --> 09:14.720

[Ani] <i>You wouldn't know it

Don't you? You thought he was yesterday.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.806
I mean,
yesterday we thought Jess was, too,

13:27.264 --> 13:28.265
but we were wrong.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.731
[Clay] I know that at one time
he definitely was.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.817
I saw it in his eyes.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.487
But then he got better.
You know he did. I saw it, too.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.366
[Ani] <i>Clay needed to believe
that Tyler could be saved.</i>

13:46.158 --> 13:49.286
<i>Otherwise, in a way,
Clay pulled that trigger, too.</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:54.500
I'm just saying, it's a guy,
with binoculars, watching people.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.294
That's the whole movie.
How is that not boring?

13:57.378 --> 14:01.215
That's what made it so great, right?
I mean, he is stuck behind glass,

14:01.298 --> 14:04.218
in a wheelchair, and he still figures out
how to play the hero.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.011
- Totally agree.
- Thank you, Tyler.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.848
I feel like
we just watched two very different movies.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.017
I mean, the camera was cool.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.395
Exakta VX. Classic.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.814
It is not about the action, Clay.
It's about...

14:20.234 --> 14:21.277
Help me out, Tyler.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.155
Well, terrible things happen every day.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.741
But we never really stop to notice,
you know?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.743
If we spent a little bit more time

14:30.119 --> 14:32.246
watching and listening, you know,

14:32.329 --> 14:36.166
to... our neighbors,
to life around us, you know,

14:36.250 --> 14:39.044
maybe the bad things
wouldn't happen so much.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.384
Or is that, like, not what you meant?

14:45.467 --> 14:48.679
That is exactly what I meant,
you brilliant, brilliant man.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.141
[Tyler titters]

14:54.768 --> 14:56.770
I’m gonna go get...

14:57.646 --> 15:00.858
a free refill of popcorn.
To take home, so...

15:05.362 --> 15:06.363
No, you're right.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.869
What if after all we've done,
or I guess tried to do...

15:13.454 --> 15:15.539
what if it's right back where we started?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.125
I want to believe that people can change.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
I know they can.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.713
You're thinking of Bryce?

15:22.796 --> 15:26.091
I'm thinking of people.
Not everything is about Bryce.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.135
Well, it kind of is, though, isn't it?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.554
- At this moment.
- [Tyler] Excuse me.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.140
Bathroom?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.518
Thank you.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.233
[door closing]

15:43.317 --> 15:45.778
Could I also, uh... Thanks.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.608
[unzipping]

16:25.567 --> 16:26.567
Tyler...

16:27.903 --> 16:29.530
- [urine trickling]
- The hell! Clay?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.782
What are you doing out here?

16:31.907 --> 16:34.952
I saw you leave robotics
and thought maybe we could talk.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.247
I didn't realize you were coming
all the way out here to, you know...

16:40.082 --> 16:41.082
I don't...

16:42.126 --> 16:43.919
like using the bathrooms.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.336
Oh.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.632
Yeah, okay.
I mean, they're kind of gross, I guess.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.509
What do you wanna talk about?

16:50.592 --> 16:51.969
Well, I just wanted to make sure

16:52.052 --> 16:55.264
that the plan was still
for you to give it to me?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.265
Yeah.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.809
Yeah, that's the plan.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.144
So...

17:03.063 --> 17:04.063
all good.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.733
Cool, okay.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.736
But why'd you bring your bag?

17:10.612 --> 17:11.612
Huh?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
I mean, if you just came out here to pee,

17:14.657 --> 17:15.909
then why bring your bag?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.578
Uh, just...

17:17.828 --> 17:19.163
people steal shit...

17:19.997 --> 17:20.997
so...

17:22.165 --> 17:23.165
Yeah.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.253
[Ani] <i>It was hard to know, though.</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:29.381
<i>Was Tyler lying to us...</i>

17:30.632 --> 17:31.884
<i>or just being Tyler?</i>

17:33.427 --> 17:37.306
Okay, if he has it and we get it from him,
what then? Do we turn him in?

17:38.348 --> 17:41.602
First we make sure he doesn't
hurt himself or anyone else, and then...

17:42.978 --> 17:44.104
we'll figure it out.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.941
Do you think you can do that again?
Do you think you should?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.449
Well, let's just pray it's a non-issue.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.118
- Okay, but how can we know for sure?
- [Zach] Yeah.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.579
How can we know?

18:01.705 --> 18:02.705
And, um...

18:04.833 --> 18:06.376
why aren't we calling the police?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.297
Seriously?

18:11.548 --> 18:14.593
- You told him?
- Dude, he's, like, part of this.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.863
He's been pretty clear
he doesn't want to be part of it.

18:16.887 --> 18:17.887
Guys...

18:18.305 --> 18:20.724
- We should call the cops.
- [Clay] Do you really think that?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.644
Or is this your chance to do
what you wanted to do all along?

18:23.727 --> 18:26.688
Look, forget about Spring Fling.
Forget about everything, okay?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.941
Somebody shot Bryce.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.818
- Tyler has a gun.
- [Clay] Look, I know.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.695
But he didn't have any reason
to kill Bryce, did he?

18:36.990 --> 18:37.990
Actually...

18:39.076 --> 18:40.076
he did.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.576
[Zach] What are you doing here?

18:51.338 --> 18:52.338
It's summer.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.883
Um... waiting for Justin.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.760
Oh, so it's Justin's day?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.262
To babysit?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.349
- We're hanging out.
- And he just lets you roam the halls?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.018
He's in class. He knows I'm here.

19:05.894 --> 19:06.894
So...

19:08.522 --> 19:09.857
what, you're all better?

19:11.024 --> 19:12.024
You're, like...

19:13.152 --> 19:14.152
safe now?

19:15.362 --> 19:16.405
Why do you hate me?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.449
Tyler, I don't hate you, okay?

19:20.576 --> 19:21.618
I'm scared of you.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.497
- And be honest, I don't trust you.
- Well, I don't trust you.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.126
I don't trust you won't call the cops.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.043
Yeah?

19:31.086 --> 19:32.086
Well...

19:32.254 --> 19:33.922
I'm not the one you need to worry about.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.801
Wait, what's that mean?

19:39.052 --> 19:41.096
Bryce saw what happened at Spring Fling.

19:42.931 --> 19:43.974
He knows everything.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.865
Why would you tell him that?

20:00.157 --> 20:01.575
Because he was...

20:03.202 --> 20:04.328
I don't know why.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.164
[bell ringing]

20:08.540 --> 20:11.585
[Ani] <i> And then, Tyler caught onto us.</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:16.173
No cops.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.143
[students chatting and laughing]

20:38.445 --> 20:40.447
[overlapping students' conversations]

20:58.632 --> 21:00.217
- [boy] Whoa!
- [girl] Hey!

21:01.551 --> 21:03.553
[tense electronic music playing]

21:17.442 --> 21:18.442
Hey, Clay.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.821
Hey, Tyler.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.159
You can look if you want to.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.685
[door opening]

22:02.654 --> 22:05.490
So, you still coming over to my house
after school?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.041
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.791
[Tyler] Cool.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.128
Can't wait.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.563
So nobody's talking about Bryce.

22:36.646 --> 22:39.232
I feel like a lot of people are talking
about Bryce.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.693
- Not to me.
- Maybe not, but...

22:42.611 --> 22:43.987
everyone's still talking.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.406
About how he got shot in the head?

22:48.241 --> 22:49.242
It's online!

22:53.038 --> 22:54.122
- Tony.
- What?

23:05.175 --> 23:06.301
You didn't call the police?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.265
Is there a reason
I should've called the police?

23:08.303 --> 23:10.430
- No, that's not...
- Because if we call the police,

23:10.514 --> 23:13.809
we're all in a shit-load of trouble.
You... you know that, right?

23:16.937 --> 23:19.314
Is that the only reason
why you didn't call them?

23:24.027 --> 23:25.904
[Ani] <i> We'd been there
for Tyler's recovery.</i>

23:27.322 --> 23:30.951
<i>So, we'd seen first-hand
the darkness Tyler had inside.</i>

23:32.077 --> 23:33.077
You see?

23:33.328 --> 23:34.329
It's pointless.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.082
- I told you this is stupid.
- Okay.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.583
Do you remember

23:38.708 --> 23:41.711
what was going on in your head that night
outside of the gym?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.465
- [stammering] I don't.
- Do you remember the feeling?

23:46.383 --> 23:48.677
Before. I mean, what got you there.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.971
It's anger.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.390
It's hurt. It's...

23:53.932 --> 23:55.350
rage. Whatever, right?

23:55.767 --> 23:58.520
It's all up here,
and it's not gonna go away.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.397
I know, 'cause...

24:01.064 --> 24:02.064
I got it, too.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.485
- You do?
- Of course I fucking do.

24:06.027 --> 24:09.906
And I'm telling you,
you can let it run you, or you can...

24:10.657 --> 24:12.117
you can grab a hold of it.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
You can...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.286
own it.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.246
Channel it.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.668
You got all this shit inside your head
that you can't...

24:22.544 --> 24:24.504
you just, you can't say, right?

24:24.921 --> 24:26.673
Yeah, there's a lot of it.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.891
Show me.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.424
That's good.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.595
Now get up. Do it again.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.349
[Ani]
<i>Did we help Tyler escape the darkness?</i>

25:17.641 --> 25:18.642
[Tony] Now, Tyler.

25:19.976 --> 25:20.976
Now!

25:21.728 --> 25:23.772
[Ani] <i>Or was there never going to be
an escape?</i>

25:25.023 --> 25:26.024
[frustrated growl]

25:33.156 --> 25:34.156
Tyler!

25:35.116 --> 25:35.992
Where are you going?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.994
What, you don't remember the spreadsheet?

25:38.578 --> 25:39.746
It's therapy Thursday.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.915
[Ani] <i>We were just kids.</i>

25:43.041 --> 25:44.834
<i>How could we help someone change?</i>

25:47.712 --> 25:50.298
[Dr. Singh] You're awfully quiet.
Any particular reason?

25:54.678 --> 25:56.388
Well, Bryce is dead, so...

25:58.932 --> 26:01.059
people are kind of freaked out about that.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.478
Are you freaked out?

26:06.064 --> 26:07.649
I guess I just, I feel like...

26:09.651 --> 26:12.279
that's all he'll ever be now.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.781
How do you mean?

26:17.075 --> 26:20.787
[sighing] Like, maybe he was going to
do something terrible...

26:22.038 --> 26:24.499
or hurt someone else... again.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.044
But maybe not, you know?

26:29.087 --> 26:33.008
And now we'll never know,
and I just think that's kind of sad.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.845
Or maybe that just makes me weird
or something.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.140
I think it makes you an empathetic person.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.602
You would've hoped
he'd had the chance to change.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.523
Well, no one thinks I can change.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.025
I think you can.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.235
I imagine your friends think you can, too.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.028
I don't...

26:54.529 --> 26:55.989
I don't have any friends.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.573
Really?

26:58.241 --> 26:59.241
No one?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.536
I see you with friends.

27:28.021 --> 27:31.691
Why'd you do it? Or... almost do it.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.068
I...

27:34.110 --> 27:35.445
uh, I don't... I don't know.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.447
But you must have had a reason.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.826
Or if you didn't, is that, like, worse?

27:42.619 --> 27:43.620
No, I did.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.164
I mean, I had reasons. I...

27:48.583 --> 27:50.043
I guess I just felt like

27:50.752 --> 27:53.046
the only way to make the hurting...

27:53.880 --> 27:58.551
stop was to make the people
who hurt me hurt too.

27:59.844 --> 28:00.845
You know?

28:01.471 --> 28:02.472
I do.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.266
I do know.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.145
But I feel like
you have to find your own way

28:09.813 --> 28:10.897
to stop hurting.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.526
You have to take back their power
to make you hurt.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.264
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.684
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to check up on you.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.519
Because they told you to?

28:50.061 --> 28:51.354
No, because I wanted to.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.901
I didn't kill Bryce.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.027
I know.

28:59.904 --> 29:00.905
I believe you.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.036
I'm supposed to go to an HO meeting.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.664
I'll walk with you.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.833
Okay.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.589
[girls chatting]

29:21.176 --> 29:23.219
- Is it cool if I...
- [girl] Yeah, go for it.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.638
[Casey]...and say the things
that nobody wants us to say

29:25.722 --> 29:26.931
that have to be said.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.175
- [girl] Watch where you're going.
- [Tyler] <i>Hey, Jess.</i>

29:32.437 --> 29:33.646
What are you doing here?

29:34.939 --> 29:38.401
[stammering] Um, it's your...
I'm supposed to hang with you

29:38.485 --> 29:39.903
- this afternoon.
- Right!

29:40.320 --> 29:41.529
Yes, of course.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.282
Survivors and allies only.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.618
Well, Tyler can be an ally.

29:47.535 --> 29:48.535
Right, Tyler?

29:48.828 --> 29:49.913
Yeah. Yeah.

29:50.872 --> 29:51.872
Come on in.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.710
Anyway, as I was saying,

29:55.794 --> 29:57.962
welcome to the first meeting

29:58.046 --> 30:00.924
- of Hands Off Our Bodies!
- Yeah!

30:01.007 --> 30:03.009
[cheering and whooping]

30:04.135 --> 30:05.553
The fliers say "Ho."

30:06.179 --> 30:08.598
Yeah. It stands for "Hands Off."

30:09.182 --> 30:11.309
Yeah, we're taking back the word.
Reclaiming it.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.393
It's cool, right?

30:12.977 --> 30:15.647
How about "Fuck Rapists
and Dismantle the Patriarchy?"

30:15.980 --> 30:18.358
I mean, it's not all that catchy,
though, is it?

30:18.441 --> 30:19.692
Okay, fair. How about...

30:20.401 --> 30:22.529
"Stab all the jocks and watch 'em bleed?"

30:22.821 --> 30:24.697
[all chuckling]

30:25.824 --> 30:27.116
Still wanna be an ally?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.494
Oh, I can get on board with that.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.620
[Casey] Okay!

30:32.247 --> 30:33.373
[Casey] <i> I'm glad he's dead.</i>

30:35.375 --> 30:36.375
I mean, aren't you?

30:37.252 --> 30:38.628
I mean, it's complicated.

30:38.711 --> 30:41.047
Well, I think whoever shot him
did the world a favor.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.882
[Casey] The only question now is:

30:42.966 --> 30:45.426
how do we make sure
they don't turn him into a martyr?

30:45.510 --> 30:48.721
I don't know.
I don't know what to think.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.142
Well, look. Just because he's dead
doesn't mean we can't still make him hurt.

30:53.434 --> 30:57.605
So, we think we should protest
Bryce's funeral this weekend.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.190
It's genius, right?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.734
I don't know, you guys.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.863
I mean, Bolan is already on me
about Homecoming.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.240
I don't think
it's the right time to start...

31:07.323 --> 31:08.366
It's the perfect time!

31:08.783 --> 31:12.787
Homecoming was just the start.
We have to go big or go home, Jess.

31:13.788 --> 31:14.788
[girl] Yeah.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.499
What, you all feel this way?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.418
- Yeah.
- [girl] Definitely.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.211
[sighing deeply]

31:21.462 --> 31:22.462
[Tyler] I don't.

31:25.174 --> 31:28.678
Sorry, but is dancing on someone's grave
really the way

31:28.761 --> 31:30.889
to show we're the bigger people here?

31:32.348 --> 31:33.933
[Casey] I'm sorry, did you just tell

31:34.642 --> 31:37.854
the only actual sexual assault victims
in the room

31:37.937 --> 31:39.939
how we should be running our club?

31:42.942 --> 31:44.611
- No, I was just...
- [Casey] Good.

31:45.111 --> 31:48.990
Because, you know, allies are welcome
and all, but be a fucking ally.

31:51.826 --> 31:55.121
All right, so it's gonna be
at that church on First Street.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.247
[girl] Yes.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.543
[Casey] I think I have a list somewhere
of who can drive, so we should carpool.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.254
It isn't even a discussion, man.
This is a fucking murder case!

32:03.338 --> 32:05.214
Why are you so hot about this?
You hated Bryce.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.216
I didn't want him dead.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.636
- You think Tyler did?
- Tyler had motive!

32:10.053 --> 32:11.054
[Monty] What about Tyler?

32:12.889 --> 32:13.723
[Zach] Nothing.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.975
Man, you guys are obsessed
with that faggot.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.561
- I see Justin with him all the time.
- [Zach] Shut up, Monty.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.521
Is it a sex thing? What's the deal?

32:21.814 --> 32:24.984
Holy shit! Did he kill Bryce?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.922
You've no idea what you're talking about
and you need to shut your mouth.

32:27.946 --> 32:32.033
No, he finally snapped and he killed Bryce
and you two dickheads are covering it up.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.952
Don't be fucking stupid, Monty.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.155
Well, it's either that or...

32:36.037 --> 32:37.455
Zach's fucking him.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.040
[boy] Oh, jeez!

32:43.127 --> 32:44.963
[coach] Oh, shit! Hey!

32:47.966 --> 32:50.843
- [boy] Come on, guys.
- [coach] Get off him! Back up!

32:55.056 --> 32:56.099
[coach] Break it up!

32:59.519 --> 33:01.980
It'll look suspicious
if you turn around and leave.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.982
Mom thinks we're friends, so...

33:05.024 --> 33:06.442
We are friends, I just...

33:07.986 --> 33:09.737
We should take care of this now.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.531
Okay.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.118
- [knocking on door]
- [Tyler's mom] Tyler, open doors.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.484
- Sorry, Mom.
- [Tyler's mom] Bring the cans up, please.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.622
[sighing] Two minutes.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.499
Yeah, coming. Sorry.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.518
[Tyler] I can explain those.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.022
This isn't what it looks like.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.399
- Really?
- Okay, Clay. Just...

34:29.484 --> 34:31.152
Calm down, okay? Just...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.945
Tyler, Jesus! What did you do?

34:33.654 --> 34:34.489
[knocking on door]

34:34.572 --> 34:36.532
Tyler, open doors.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.079
Hi, Clay. It's good to see you again.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.873
- Hi, Mrs. Down.
- [Mrs. Down] Dinner's on the table.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.251
I'm hoping you'll join us, Clay?

34:55.134 --> 34:56.135
Thank you.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.389
[Mrs. Down] I just worry for you kids.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.850
I mean, has the school done anything?

35:02.975 --> 35:06.521
They made an announcement over the PA.
They're offering counseling.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.816
Yeah, well, it's incredibly upsetting.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.527
So, if you want to talk about anything...

35:14.987 --> 35:15.988
I think...

35:17.115 --> 35:20.326
you know, we're all still trying
to figure out how we feel.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.080
And... what's true and what isn't.

35:25.414 --> 35:26.749
[Mr. Down] Well, sure. I mean,

35:27.667 --> 35:31.045
it's just so awful to think
that a kid could do something like this.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.756
Well, do they know Bryce was murdered?

35:34.882 --> 35:36.509
The paper says he was shot.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.220
But, you know,
that also doesn't prove anything.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.303
I mean, maybe...

35:40.805 --> 35:41.889
he shot himself.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.933
He was a troubled kid.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.564
[Clay] <i>Don't even worry about it.
I couldn't sleep either.</i>

35:50.982 --> 35:51.983
Why can't you sleep?

35:53.651 --> 35:54.651
Just...

35:55.444 --> 35:57.488
- crazy dreams, I guess.
- Yeah.

35:58.656 --> 35:59.699
What are they about?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.722
You really... you really want to know?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.166
Yeah.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.170
They're about you.

36:14.755 --> 36:15.756
It's the same one.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.469
The night of Spring Fling
and I'm standing in front of you,

36:21.137 --> 36:22.430
just like it happened,

36:23.181 --> 36:24.181
but...

36:24.932 --> 36:25.932
in the dream...

36:27.018 --> 36:28.227
you pull the trigger.

36:29.979 --> 36:34.233
And I know they say you never actually
see yourself die in your dreams, but...

36:35.985 --> 36:38.696
it really feels like I do in mine.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.365
Jesus.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.077
That's messed up.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.578
Yeah.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.413
I'm sorry.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.502
- Clay, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, I know. It...

36:55.046 --> 36:56.130
Dreams are dreams.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.506
But...

37:02.261 --> 37:04.972
If I hadn't said what I said that night...

37:06.641 --> 37:07.641
or...

37:08.809 --> 37:10.728
maybe if I'd said the wrong thing...

37:12.939 --> 37:13.940
would you have...

37:15.316 --> 37:16.317
shot me?

37:23.783 --> 37:24.784
I don't know.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.831
[Mrs. Down] Well, in any event, Clay,

37:31.457 --> 37:35.002
I cannot tell you what a difference
it's made having you in Tyler's life.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.546
[Mr. Down] Yeah. You and Tony and Alex,

37:37.630 --> 37:39.382
you've just been such good friends.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.216
You guys...

37:42.009 --> 37:44.220
- you're embarrassing me.
- [Mrs. Down] Well, it's true.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.807
After that frightening false alarm
last spring,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.851
you've been so kind to him.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.146
You kids look out for each other.
It gives me hope for the future.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.523
I'm serious.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
Don't laugh.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.580
[Ani] <i>Remember when I said
maybe Tyler was finishing what he started?</i>

38:13.749 --> 38:16.794
Tyler, listen. Look, it's gonna be okay,
whatever you did.

38:16.877 --> 38:20.589
What, do you think I'm gonna, like...
stab you in my house?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.926
I don't know. I just know that
whatever happened,

38:24.427 --> 38:25.678
we can take care of it.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.889
What do you think I did?

38:30.766 --> 38:31.766
Say it.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.686
Say it, Clay!

38:33.769 --> 38:35.062
I think you shot Bryce!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.753
I kept the gun because I thought
I might have to use it.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.674
[Ani] <i>Well, we were right,</i>

39:04.133 --> 39:05.133
<i>in a way.</i>

39:05.801 --> 39:07.470
<i>Tyler did want to hurt someone.</i>

39:17.396 --> 39:20.441
<i>Spring Fling had always been
a suicide mission.</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:29.283
[breathing deeply]

39:32.620 --> 39:33.913
[sobbing]

39:41.629 --> 39:45.800
[Ani] <i>And when that didn't work out,
he went looking for closure in other ways.</i>

39:55.184 --> 39:56.185
I want an apology.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.561
What?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.482
I want you to say you're sorry.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.442
For what you did.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.165
[scoffs] No idea
what you're talking about.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.696
Say you're sorry

40:08.447 --> 40:09.782
or I'll take you down.

40:11.742 --> 40:12.910
And Taylor and Kenneth.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.412
Yeah?

40:16.747 --> 40:19.625
What about Bryce?
Are you gonna take him down?

40:21.877 --> 40:22.877
Bryce?

40:23.379 --> 40:24.630
Come on, you remember.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.716
No one did anything at this school
without him saying go.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.470
You think you're going to get an apology
out of him?

40:32.972 --> 40:35.307
[stammering] He told you to do it?

40:36.642 --> 40:37.810
And he's gone, right?

40:38.477 --> 40:39.477
Out of your life.

40:40.146 --> 40:44.233
Ty-Ty, nothing happened to you
that hasn't happened to a hundred guys.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.402
It's nothing.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.237
Get over it.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.542
[knocking on door]

41:02.251 --> 41:04.587
- [Bryce] Yeah? What?
- [Tyler] Open the fucking door.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.547
Tyler?

41:10.259 --> 41:11.343
[closes laptop]

41:14.972 --> 41:16.390
- [Tyler] Get back!
- Jesus, Tyler!

41:16.474 --> 41:19.101
- Shut up. Get back!
- Dude, what the fuck is going on?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.185
Did you know?

41:21.020 --> 41:23.522
- About Monty, did you know?
- What about Monty?

41:23.981 --> 41:26.181
He said nothing happened at Liberty
without you knowing.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.819
- Is that true?
- Not anymore.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.905
What did Monty do to you?

41:33.240 --> 41:34.992
Jesus, Tyler, what did he do?

41:36.035 --> 41:38.829
He said he didn't do shit
without you telling him to.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.832
Monty did a bunch
without me telling him to.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.501
He went off the rails last year, dude.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.086
The trial, the whole Hannah thing,
it all freaked him out.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.839
What is this about?

41:51.884 --> 41:53.802
You know about Spring Fling, right?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.514
You saw what I almost did?

41:57.681 --> 41:58.849
Are you gonna tell anyone?

41:59.225 --> 42:00.225
The police?

42:00.309 --> 42:03.145
I talked to the police that night.
I didn't say anything.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.397
- And I'm not going to.
- Why?

42:06.232 --> 42:07.274
Why wouldn't you?

42:07.399 --> 42:09.276
- Why would I?
- Because you hate me!

42:11.445 --> 42:12.613
I don't hate you.

42:15.783 --> 42:16.867
Justin helped you.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.079
And I have hurt Justin enough
in this life.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.164
So, I'm not gonna narc on him now.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.126
- So, it was for Justin?
- Those guys saved you, man.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.462
That's decent.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.508
Maybe I'd like to think
someone would do that for me.

42:32.591 --> 42:34.468
No. No, we're not the same.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.137
You hurt people. I didn't.

42:38.347 --> 42:40.057
Aren't you here to hurt me now?

42:42.184 --> 42:43.184
[Bryce laughing]

42:43.978 --> 42:45.062
So, do it, man.

42:47.022 --> 42:48.022
Seriously.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.777
If it'll make you feel better, go ahead.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.779
You'd be doing me a favor.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.073
You don't want to die.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.827
Come on, dude. You could kill the monster.
This town would celebrate.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.664
You're right, I hurt people.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.083
I don't get to start over.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.627
'Cause no one's gonna let me.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.256
So, go ahead. Shoot me.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.261
[Ani] <i> So, yeah, Tyler did confront Bryce.</i>

43:22.016 --> 43:24.685

43:25.436 --> 43:26.979
I had the chance to kill him.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.441
And I didn't.

43:31.525 --> 43:32.985
But you have the pictures.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.570
Because I found him.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.404
In the water.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.867
I'm the one who called the police
and told them where he was.

43:39.950 --> 43:42.369
- You told the police?
- Anonymously.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.705
Because I knew how it would look.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.499
Why were you at the bridge
in the first place?

43:50.169 --> 43:51.211
Because...

43:53.464 --> 43:54.464
I was...

43:55.382 --> 43:56.425
gonna jump.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.345
Why?

43:59.511 --> 44:03.265
I knew things
were never gonna get better, and...

44:03.349 --> 44:04.349
[sobbing]

44:04.808 --> 44:06.727
no one was gonna come to my rescue.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.105
No one really believed
that I could change.

44:12.900 --> 44:13.901
But I do.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.445
I do believe it.

44:19.114 --> 44:20.240
You didn't today.

44:21.825 --> 44:22.910
I didn't either,

44:23.577 --> 44:24.828
for a long time.

44:26.747 --> 44:30.125
I thought I'd never be able to get away
from who I was.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.505
Who I've been.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.009
From what hurt.

44:41.136 --> 44:43.305
So, I climbed the bridge, and...

44:47.017 --> 44:52.064
And I looked down, and I saw this,
like, flash of purple, like a jacket.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.484
And somehow, I just knew.

44:56.860 --> 45:00.030
So, I went down below the bridge.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.157
And I saw it...

45:02.741 --> 45:03.741
him...

45:04.201 --> 45:05.201
Bryce.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.787

45:13.836 --> 45:15.671
Like, gray. Like, not a...

45:16.839 --> 45:17.839

45:21.719 --> 45:22.970
And I thought...

45:26.432 --> 45:27.599
"That's it.

45:31.770 --> 45:34.565
He doesn't get to be anyone anymore.

45:36.984 --> 45:37.984
It's over...

45:38.610 --> 45:39.610
for him."

45:44.825 --> 45:48.328
And I knew right then
that I didn't want to be dead.

45:51.206 --> 45:52.249
I want to live,

45:52.916 --> 45:55.711

45:55.794 --> 45:56.795
and that's...

45:58.505 --> 46:00.591
that's why I want to give the gun away.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.138
Because I didn't need it anymore.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.146
It hasn't been fired.

46:14.688 --> 46:18.609
I've kept it over a year
