01:23.709 --> 01:26.701
A man once said
he went to a fight

01:26.709 --> 01:28.700
and a hockey game broke out.

01:28.709 --> 01:31.701
Lots of people think
fighting's a part of the sport.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.165
well, it shouldn't be.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.703
Played the right way,
it requires skill,

01:35.709 --> 01:37.700
coordination,
stamina and finesse.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.700
Of course,
a little muscle doesn't hurt.

01:39.709 --> 01:40.698
Keep your head up!

01:50.208 --> 01:51.698
I don't think
this will take very long.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.699
why don't you just drive
around the block a few times?

02:17.208 --> 02:18.197
It is all there.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.206
Three-quarters of a million.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.739
I said it was all there.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.741
So, what?

02:24.750 --> 02:27.241
Mr. Simmons, we have done
business in the past.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.740
we have always
treated you fairly, ja?

02:30.750 --> 02:33.241
when I was a kid,
I was known as a rink rat.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.741
The first one on the ice
and the last one off it.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.240
So as a bonus
for my last assignment,

02:37.750 --> 02:38.739
I asked Pete Thornton

02:38.750 --> 02:40.741
to arrange a scrimmage
with the Squires.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.740
I was kind of nervous

02:42.750 --> 02:44.240
lacing up my skates,

02:44.250 --> 02:47.242
but once I was out there,
it was just like old times.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.248
Got to keep your head up, eh!

02:52.792 --> 02:54.248
Yeah!

02:54.250 --> 02:57.242
NAVCOM 24 is not just any
piece of hardware, gentlemen.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.784
we're talking about the most
sophisticated navigation system

03:00.792 --> 03:01.781
ever developed.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.786
when will it be ready
for shipment?

03:04.291 --> 03:06.782
It's waiting for you now
at the Pier Three drop.

03:07.291 --> 03:13.291
The crates are labeled
"Sauerkraut."

03:13.291 --> 03:15.782
Until next time, comrades.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.828
I'd love to see their faces
when they realize

03:37.834 --> 03:39.825
they just paid
three-quarters of a million

03:39.834 --> 03:41.825
for two crates
of sauerkraut.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.327
Here, you buy the tickets...
one way to Rio.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.324
we leave in three days.

03:47.333 --> 03:50.325
Put 12 guys carrying sticks
in an enclosed area,

03:50.333 --> 03:52.324
and sooner or later
men will be boys.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.823
Seven, two minutes!
Elbow! Let's go!

03:54.834 --> 03:56.324
what're you talking about?!

03:56.834 --> 03:57.823
Two on one...
you call that fair?

03:57.834 --> 03:58.823
You got another two

03:59.333 --> 04:00.322
for opening your mouth.
Let's go!

04:00.333 --> 04:03.871
Come on! Open your eyes!
Get in there.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.322
That's bush!

04:07.875 --> 04:09.866
I rented a room down on Sixth.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.331
Drop me off now,
pick me up tomorrow.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.331
we'll make the rounds,
wrap up the business. Let's go.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.331
The penalty box

04:19.333 --> 04:21.870
is hockey's version
of solitary confinement.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.331
Except you serve your time

04:23.333 --> 04:25.369
in front of
a rink full of people.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.364
Hey, Mac.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.866
You want some oxygen?

04:28.875 --> 04:30.365
How long you been there?

04:30.375 --> 04:31.865
Oh, not long.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.866
well, I did get to see you,
uh, inspect the ice

04:34.875 --> 04:36.365
from pretty close range.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.366
Hey, wait a minute.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.866
You promised.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.365
No assignments for a week

04:42.375 --> 04:43.364
at least, right?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.374
Mac, I came down here
to watch you play.

04:46.375 --> 04:47.911
Higher, Grandpa.

04:47.917 --> 04:49.908
No, honey, you'll fall.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.373
Higher.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.911
well, just a little.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.373
Up, up we go.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.367
That's right.
You hold on.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.373
Let's go.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.407
Mr. Banning, look out!

05:15.417 --> 05:17.908
Jimmy.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.908
Oh. Oh, Jimmy.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.952
with protection like this,
I'm lucky to be alive, huh?

05:31.417 --> 05:32.953
Say...

05:32.959 --> 05:34.415
for a guy who's
been in the joint,

05:34.417 --> 05:35.953
you look good.

05:35.959 --> 05:37.950
I looked better
before I went in.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.954
Ten years is a long time,
Mr. Banning.

05:40.959 --> 05:43.951
"Mr. Banning."
I'm Papa Chuck.

05:44.959 --> 05:47.450
I got a job for you.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.449
Yeah, I know, Mac.
You want some time off.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.950
Fix up your place,
play a little hockey.

05:52.959 --> 05:56.451
I know. Right now you're
not interested that, uh,

05:56.458 --> 05:57.948
some of the country's

05:57.959 --> 05:59.449
most precious
and top-secret technology

05:59.959 --> 06:03.451
is being handed over
to the East Germans.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.995
The federal government figures
a full-scale investigation

06:06.001 --> 06:07.992
would tip off
the East Germans so, uh,

06:08.001 --> 06:09.457
we're handling it.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.996
The Foundation is handling it.

06:13.001 --> 06:13.990
we had a suspect

06:14.001 --> 06:17.448
under surveillance
at Vectrocon Systems, but, uh,

06:17.458 --> 06:20.450
just when we were about
to take him, he disappeared.

06:20.458 --> 06:21.447
You mean Simmons?

06:21.458 --> 06:22.447
what?

06:22.458 --> 06:23.447
How'd you know that?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.492
we needed somebody who could
get his hands on the goods.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.489
Simmons was ripe,

06:31.500 --> 06:32.990
so we plucked him.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.491
So now he decided to pluck you.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.489
Right.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.991
So if we can find this Simmons
and, uh,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.491
get the names
of his East German contacts,

06:41.500 --> 06:44.492
we can shut down this technology
pipeline they've got going.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.992
Jimmy, if I let Simmons get away
with this little game,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.992
how could I hold my head up
in the family, huh?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.490
Take the contract on him.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.490
It's been ten years.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.537
It's like riding a bike...
you never forget.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.533
Hey, Pete,

07:06.542 --> 07:07.998
I thought you gave
up your cloak and dagger

07:08.542 --> 07:09.998
when you joined the
Phoenix Foundation.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.991
Yeah, you and me both.

07:12.542 --> 07:13.998
I'm retired now.
I'm through with it.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.999
Grandpa, look, ice cream.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.991
It's almost suppertime, honey!

07:22.542 --> 07:24.032
I'm not the same guy I was.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.032
I don't have the heart for it.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.532
My knees are shot.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.533
My left eye clouds up on me.

07:30.542 --> 07:34.535
Hey, you're The Eraser.

07:35.041 --> 07:36.030
Bad knees and one eye,

07:36.542 --> 07:40.535
you're still the best
hitter since DiMaggio.

07:40.542 --> 07:43.033
Pete, you're fishing
for something.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.032
Just one more job, Jimmy.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.577
For all we've been through.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.574
Otherwise,
my head's on the block.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.574
Grandpa.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.575
Now, now don't tell Grandma.

07:53.583 --> 07:56.040
Is that a face? Is that a face?

07:59.041 --> 08:01.578
Jimmy, I want to keep this
on a personal basis.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.074
I don't want to call in
any of your markers.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.074
what do you say?

08:13.583 --> 08:15.574
Thank you.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.074
Mac, I'm really in a jam.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.573
You wouldn't take this job,
would you?

08:23.083 --> 08:25.074
All you had to
do was ask, Pete.

08:26.625 --> 08:27.614
You got a file on Simmons?

08:28.083 --> 08:29.619
Yeah,

08:29.625 --> 08:31.081
I already put it
in your locker,

08:31.083 --> 08:34.075
along with the latest
surveillance photos.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.072
Oh, by the way,

08:35.082 --> 08:37.620
he's heavily invested
in a bar downtown.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.614
Great.
Going back in?

08:38.625 --> 08:39.614
Yeah.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.081
Show 'em
how to skate now.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.620
Go on, Mac.
Do it!

08:45.125 --> 08:48.117
Game of finesse.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.616
I don't know what's wrong
with this thing.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.616
It's never done this before.

08:59.625 --> 09:02.116
Sure I can't get you some wine?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.114
Let me see it.

09:06.125 --> 09:10.118
I think what we have here is
a gas pressure problem.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.114
Got any olives?

09:11.667 --> 09:12.122
Olives?

09:12.125 --> 09:14.116
Yeah, the little green ones

09:14.125 --> 09:15.661
with the, uh, pimiento.

09:22.125 --> 09:22.659
Thanks.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.656
I love these things.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.656
Love 'em.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.659
we just bleed off
some of the carbon dioxide

09:35.667 --> 09:38.659
and that'll dislodge the valve,

09:38.667 --> 09:40.157
which is obviously stuck.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.656
Then...

09:43.667 --> 09:45.703
...we'll have ginger ale.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.155
It's working.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.703
You sure you
just want ginger ale?

09:52.166 --> 09:53.155
I could
put something in that.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.702
No, the bubbles are
just fine, thanks.

09:57.709 --> 10:00.155
Make it?
Yeah.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.702
Thanks, pal.

10:01.709 --> 10:02.698
Take my advice: stay young.

10:03.166 --> 10:03.700
I'll try.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.197
Shot of rye, honey.

10:06.709 --> 10:09.200
Believe it or not, I used to
have a great set of wheels.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.699
Home to first base,
three and a half seconds.

10:11.709 --> 10:14.701
But this arthritis...

10:14.709 --> 10:17.701
Thank you.

10:17.709 --> 10:18.698
Luck.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.199
Skoal.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.199
Listen, can I ask you something?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.197
I'm looking for a Michael Simmons.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.739
Is he around?

10:28.750 --> 10:30.741
I haven't seen him
in a few days,

10:30.750 --> 10:33.207
but you might want to try him
at the car lot

10:33.208 --> 10:34.744
on the next block over.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.206
He owns a piece of that, too.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.197
All right,
thanks a lot.

11:22.250 --> 11:25.788
Hey, nice, real nice.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.283
You know, I'd buy this tomorrow
if it was red.

11:30.291 --> 11:33.283
Okay, I couldn't help
overhearing you back at the bar.

11:33.291 --> 11:36.283
I'm looking for Michael Simmons,
too. He's my son.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.783
I mean, this is the both of us.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.282
Atlantic City, '64,

11:42.291 --> 11:44.828
before the casinos.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.280
And you haven't seen him, huh?

11:46.291 --> 11:48.282
well, we ain't exactly
been tight over the years.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.827
I came into town
three days ago.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.823
He was supposed to meet me.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.280
He never shows.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.282
I ask around...
everybody's a clam.

11:54.291 --> 11:55.280
Then I run into you.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.282
I mean on the Q.T.,
is he in trouble?

11:57.291 --> 11:58.280
Are you a cop?

11:58.834 --> 11:59.823
No.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.280
Uh, well, look,
then, Mister, uh...

12:02.291 --> 12:03.827
MacGyver.

12:03.834 --> 12:04.823
Nice to meet you.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.324
Supposin' that me and you

12:06.834 --> 12:07.823
put our heads together.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.826
I don't think so, Mr. Simmons.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.825
Jimmy.
Just call me Jimmy.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.325
Jimmy. These things
can be a little dangerous.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.324
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

12:17.834 --> 12:21.326
Then he is in trouble.

12:22.834 --> 12:23.823
Look, pal,

12:24.333 --> 12:25.322
you probably know what it's like

12:25.875 --> 12:27.331
having your old man
hanging around... my Mikey don't.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.331
A prince among
men I ain't,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.324
but if my boy's
in trouble...

12:33.875 --> 12:35.866
well, I just want to help.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.324
I want to be a father to him.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.869
I never done that before.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.866
All right,
where are you staying?

12:44.875 --> 12:46.866
Ah, some fleabag hotel.

12:46.875 --> 12:47.864
The Armstrong.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.866
The roaches are friendly.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.365
Yeah.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.367
All right, if I find him,
I'll give you a call.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.364
Thank you.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.908
I guess
there are a lot of reasons

13:16.917 --> 13:19.374
why a man would sell
his country's secrets,

13:19.375 --> 13:22.367
but the most common is also
the hardest to understand...

13:22.375 --> 13:24.411
simple greed.

13:24.417 --> 13:28.410
Of course, Simmons had
his fingers in so many pies,

13:28.417 --> 13:31.409
the word "simple"
didn't really fit.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.909
Some people give at the office.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.909
Simmons took from it.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.409
Vectrocon Systems
was his base of operations.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.407
I figured it might provide me

13:43.917 --> 13:46.954
with an idea or two
of where to find him.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.996
I've never minded
checking out bars or car lots.

14:25.001 --> 14:28.448
That's because they're usually
not ten floors up.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.450
Pete didn't want to alert
the people at Vectrocon Systems

14:31.458 --> 14:34.450
in case Simmons wasn't
the company's only bad apple.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.992
which is why I found myself

14:39.001 --> 14:40.457
hanging around
an elevator shaft

14:40.458 --> 14:43.996
in total violation
of every instinct I own.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.992
You can tell a lot
about someone

15:04.001 --> 15:05.992
by the things
he keeps on his desk...

15:07.500 --> 15:48.542
...provided
you can get to his desk.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.033
Electrical locks
are designed to open

15:51.041 --> 15:53.532
when a person inside
hits a button.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.032
Nice thing about
these kinds of locks

16:01.542 --> 16:03.533
is that if you give 'em
a power surge,

16:03.542 --> 16:07.034
they don't know which side
of the door you're on.

16:22.041 --> 16:24.578
Simmons didn't waste any time

16:24.583 --> 16:26.073
moving everything
out of his apartment.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.075
I was hoping he hadn't been
as thorough here.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.620
"Linda. 401 west Beech."

16:56.625 --> 16:59.617
See you soon, Linda.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.619
It's a funny thing
about elevator shafts...

17:04.625 --> 17:07.116
they're just as dark
and just as scary

17:07.125 --> 17:09.616
when you're riding down
as when you're riding up.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.116
Bottom line, though,

17:12.625 --> 17:16.617
I got what I came for and...
I was still alive.

17:20.625 --> 17:23.116
My mom used to tell me,
"when you visit someplace,

17:23.625 --> 17:26.116
make sure you leave it
the same way you found it."

17:28.125 --> 17:30.662
I replaced Simmons' door lock,

17:30.667 --> 17:33.124
and with the vent cover
back in place,

17:33.125 --> 17:35.662
no one would ever know
I'd been there.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.658
Nice going, buddy, but I...

18:09.709 --> 18:11.700
It's a good thing
I've been tailing you.

18:11.709 --> 18:13.700
Yeah.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.165
why?

18:15.166 --> 18:17.157
well, these things
can get dangerous,

18:17.166 --> 18:19.157
and I wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.702
Yeah.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.702
Hey, nice neck of the woods.

18:22.709 --> 18:23.698
Lived here long?

18:23.709 --> 18:25.199
Oh, about six months.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.197
Little fixer-upper.

18:26.709 --> 18:28.700
I keep the hardware
store in business.

18:31.709 --> 18:32.698
This is it.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.199
Smell that sea air.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.699
Yeah, the ocean's
just a couple of miles that way.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.700
Come on.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.200
I lived by the beach
when I was a kid in Jersey City.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.745
well, it really wasn't a beach,
it was a drainage ditch,

18:48.208 --> 18:50.745
but my mother said
it was a beach, and I believed.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.206
Come on in.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.199
I love what you've
done with the place.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.744
Right.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.741
Hockey.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.240
Beautiful game.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.740
I don't like the jerks

19:09.750 --> 19:11.741
who just go there
for the fighting, though.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.240
Did you ever play?

19:13.750 --> 19:14.739
Nah, I skated on my ankles.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.740
Baseball was my game.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.241
'47 Braves.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.240
That's when they
were in Boston.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.241
Get out of here.
You were in the majors?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.239
For two whole weeks.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.783
They called me up in case
the other guy got hurt.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.249
The bum stayed healthy.
I never got into the game.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.241
They had me
driving the team bus.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.787
But for two weeks,
I was a major leaguer.

19:36.792 --> 19:37.781
No kidding.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.786
The wind got it.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.282
You know, when I was your age,

19:47.291 --> 19:50.283
I used to have the itch
to keep moving all the time,

19:50.291 --> 19:52.282
always looking for that
next piece of excitement.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.781
Know what I mean?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.782
Then one day I wake up,
I'm not young anymore.

19:59.291 --> 20:01.282
Racked up a lot of miles,
but no people.

20:01.291 --> 20:04.283
Very easy trap to fall into.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.825
Now I don't want
no more excitement.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.290
I just want to go
where the weather's nice,

20:09.834 --> 20:11.825
watch kids play ball...

20:11.834 --> 20:14.826
But first I got to get things,
uh, straight with Mikey.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.827
I might be on to something.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.825
He's got a girlfriend.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.290
what did I tell you?

20:22.291 --> 20:24.282
You do the looking,
I'll do the following,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.828
and everything's
going to be just lovely.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.825
Yeah.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.324
Hey, I want to thank you
for putting me up.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.324
I mean, it beats that hotel
by a furlong.

20:36.834 --> 20:37.823
How about some dinner?

20:37.834 --> 20:38.823
In or out?

20:38.834 --> 20:40.825
Take your chances.
what're you kidding?

20:40.834 --> 20:42.324
All right,
just in case, I cook.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.823
I want you to know.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.870
MacGyver at center of ice.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.866
Shoots...
shoots it wide.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.331
In the corne
Come on!

20:49.333 --> 20:50.869
And breaking down
through the blue line.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.869
Come on, it's like a power...
what? No!

20:53.333 --> 20:54.869
Corner...
rebound, shoots, scores!

20:54.875 --> 20:55.864
Oh, no!

20:55.875 --> 20:57.331
Oh, finesse!

20:57.333 --> 21:00.325
He shoots, scores and wins.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.325
I mean, I haven't done
dishes since I was a kid.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.870
well, you just earned
the right to do them tonight.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.366
Congratulations.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.866
It's a great game, isn't it?

21:14.875 --> 21:18.367
You dreamed of making it
to the pros, didn't you?

21:21.875 --> 21:23.866
Yup.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.911
well, like I used
to tell Mikey,

21:29.375 --> 21:30.364
dreams are important,

21:30.917 --> 21:34.364
otherwise, sleep is just
eight hours of nothing.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.366
So, what got you into
your current line of work?

21:40.375 --> 21:43.913
I don't know what it is,
but there must be an easier way

21:43.917 --> 21:44.906
of making a living.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.908
Yeah.

21:51.917 --> 21:54.909
Simmons' girlfriend, Linda,
and I had a date for lunch.

21:55.417 --> 21:58.909
She didn't know about it,
so I started without her.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.408
I like alfalfa sprouts
for two reasons...

22:01.417 --> 22:04.955
lots of minerals and...
they don't stain your clothes.

22:38.959 --> 22:39.948
Look at this!

22:39.959 --> 22:41.449
My eyes are my best feature!

22:41.458 --> 22:42.447
Especially this one!

22:42.458 --> 22:44.995
You should have gotten
your face outta the way.

22:45.001 --> 22:46.992
I had to make it
look good for MacGyver.

22:47.001 --> 22:48.992
You betting, Jake?

22:49.001 --> 22:49.990
Nah, garbage.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.457
what is it with that guy?

22:52.001 --> 22:53.992
I still say you ou
ght to take care of him

22:54.001 --> 22:55.457
after he leads you to Simmons.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.994
It ain't part of the contract.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.992
Yeah, but if MacGyver
gets in the way...

22:59.001 --> 23:00.457
I'll worry about it then.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.995
And let me suggest this...
keep your mouth shut

23:03.001 --> 23:04.992
before your brains spill out
all over the floor.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.491
what do you got?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.990
Two pair.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.489
Three kings.

23:10.001 --> 23:10.990
No good.
Full boat.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.492
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.491
If Simmons picked
this neighborhood

23:36.500 --> 23:39.492
because of its low profile,
he made a great choice.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.492
Everything you always wanted
in a slum

23:42.500 --> 23:43.990
and less.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.534
whenever I see a car phone,
I can't help wondering

24:02.542 --> 24:05.534
whether the person
who owns itisimportant

24:05.542 --> 24:08.033
or wants everyone else
tothinkhe's important.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.534
Simmons obviously fell
into the latter category.

24:31.041 --> 24:34.033
with the proper connections,
it's possible

24:34.583 --> 24:36.039
that a cellular phone
can reach out

24:36.583 --> 24:40.576
and touch the security system
of the car's onboard computer.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.073
I was hopin' to take control

24:47.083 --> 24:49.074
of Linda's very expensive new toy

24:49.083 --> 24:52.575
by simply getting the phone
to talk to the computer,

24:52.583 --> 24:55.074
knowing that computers
always do as they're told...

24:57.583 --> 25:00.074
...except at my bank,
of course.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.115
You're just gonna
sit around and wait

25:26.125 --> 25:27.615
for MacGyver to hand
le the legwork, huh?

25:28.125 --> 25:29.114
It's my plan
at the moment.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.615
If Papa Chuck knew

25:30.625 --> 25:32.616
you were gonna handle it
that way, he would have...

25:32.625 --> 25:33.614
Mr. Banning to you.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.616
He hired you to do a job,
do it your way.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.114
Hello?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.662
Jimmy, it's MacGyver.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.658
It's Father's Day.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.658
No kiddin'.

25:50.125 --> 25:51.661
Yeah, I know
exactly where it is.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.114
Hey, do me a favor, huh?

25:53.125 --> 25:54.114
Uh,

25:54.667 --> 25:56.123
don't tell him that I'm comin'.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.116
I want it to be a surprise.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.661
You got it.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.123
MacGyver's got Simmons.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.160
Give me the keys.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.157
Papa Chuck wants me to drive.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.157
I never had a driver in my life.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.657
Hey, you been in
the joint ten years.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.157
He knows you don't have
a driving license,

26:14.166 --> 26:17.158
so, uh, I volunteered.

26:17.166 --> 26:19.157
well, let's go,
nosebleed.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.702
Hello?

26:40.709 --> 26:43.155
Yeah, I want a 12-inch pizza.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.202
Run it through the garden,
hold the 'chovies.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.200
we're locked in here!

26:53.208 --> 26:55.199
what's goin'
on? Look,

26:55.208 --> 26:57.199
start the car and
let's get out of here.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.698
It won't start.

27:04.709 --> 27:06.745
Do something.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.206
Howdy.

27:13.208 --> 27:15.199
Hey, the doors are locked.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.199
You folks got a problem?

27:18.750 --> 27:20.206
Yes, we've got a problem.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.197
The doors are locked.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.744
we can't get 'em open.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.206
Can't hear ya.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.244
windows closed.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.077
we're locked in here.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.072
Pick up the phone.

27:34.083 --> 27:36.074
what?

27:36.083 --> 27:37.573
The phone. Pick it up.

27:42.583 --> 27:44.073
Yeah, that'll do it.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.072
Come on out.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.074
what the hell's
goin' on here? what?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.072
Excuse me.
Let's just say

27:48.083 --> 27:49.573
somebody from the government

27:49.583 --> 27:51.574
want to talk over a few things
with you, okay?

27:51.583 --> 27:52.618
Hang on here.

27:52.625 --> 27:54.081
Linda, sweetheart,

27:54.083 --> 27:55.619
the car'll go now.

27:55.625 --> 27:58.617
I suggest you go with it.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.620
Linda!

28:04.625 --> 28:06.081
That's loyalty.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.616
You ought to know.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.081
I'm... Hold it!

28:11.625 --> 28:14.617
That would be a big mistake.

28:14.625 --> 28:15.614
Take it easy, okay?

28:15.625 --> 28:17.115
All right.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.114
Come on.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.614
Come on!

28:19.625 --> 28:20.614
I'm coming, I'm coming.

28:21.125 --> 28:22.114
we'll just wait in my car.

28:22.125 --> 28:23.615
what do you say?

28:23.625 --> 28:25.115
Uh, for what?

28:25.125 --> 28:27.116
what are you government,
FBI, what?

28:27.125 --> 28:28.114
I promised somebody

28:28.125 --> 28:30.616
they could talk to you
before I took you in.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.116
Evidently, they think
you're worth the effort.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.661
who?

28:34.667 --> 28:36.123
Your father.

28:37.667 --> 28:38.656
My father's dead.

28:38.667 --> 28:39.656
what are you talking about?

28:43.667 --> 28:44.656
In case you need backup.

28:44.667 --> 28:45.656
I'm warning you, Ralph.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.658
Stay put.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.658
Look, I don't care
what somebody told you.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.656
My father's been
dead for six years.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.157
Yeah?

29:04.166 --> 29:06.657
well, if Jimmy's not your father,

29:06.667 --> 29:09.158
who's he?

29:10.667 --> 29:12.157
Let's go, come on. They're
setting me up. It's a hit!

30:02.750 --> 30:03.739
what in the hell
is going on here?

30:03.750 --> 30:05.206
who are you?

30:05.208 --> 30:08.200
I'm the guy who's going to try
and get you out of here alive.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.197
Maybe.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.241
what are you doing?

30:23.250 --> 30:26.742
Yes.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.240
what are you doing?

30:30.250 --> 30:32.241
Improvising.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.787
what kind of gas is that?

30:42.792 --> 30:44.783
It's the only kind we've got.

30:44.792 --> 30:46.783
Yeah, but it could-could...
it could explode.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.783
Yeah? would you rather
take your chances

30:48.792 --> 30:50.783
with Prince Charming out there?

30:55.792 --> 30:57.282
Look, if this works,

30:57.291 --> 30:59.782
it'll keep us
from gettin' caught.

30:59.792 --> 31:03.284
If it doesn't,
it'll keep us from gettin' old.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.282
Hand me that other rag,
will you?

31:13.291 --> 31:15.282
You got a light?

31:15.291 --> 31:16.827
I got a light, yeah.

31:21.291 --> 31:24.283
Boy, I hope this works.

31:37.834 --> 31:39.825
Help me with this.
Right.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.332
Get out of the way, MacGyver.

32:02.875 --> 32:05.867
Now.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.866
You know,

32:07.875 --> 32:10.332
I've been wrong ab
out a lot of people,

32:10.333 --> 32:13.370
but I have never
been this wrong.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.865
It's a contract.

32:14.875 --> 32:16.365
It has nothin' to do with you.

32:16.375 --> 32:17.865
So step aside.

32:17.875 --> 32:18.864
Can't do it.

32:18.875 --> 32:19.864
Guy's scum.

32:20.375 --> 32:21.364
His life ain't worth savin'.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.364
That may be so,

32:22.875 --> 32:23.864
but I can't make
that decision

32:23.875 --> 32:25.365
about people, Jimmy.

32:25.375 --> 32:26.865
If that's really your name.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.866
That's right, Jimmy Kendall.

32:28.875 --> 32:31.366
Now I'm telling you
for the last time...

32:31.375 --> 32:33.366
wait a minute, wait a minute.

32:33.375 --> 32:35.912
Uh... Uh, well,
who was that, uh,

32:36.375 --> 32:38.912
in that picture then
that you had in your wallet?

32:38.917 --> 32:41.374
That was me
and my nephew, Frankie.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.364
My sister's kid.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.366
Oh.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.366
You know,
I bought your whole story.

32:49.375 --> 32:50.911
The Boston Braves.

32:50.917 --> 32:51.906
True.

32:51.917 --> 32:53.407
Bad knees.

32:53.417 --> 32:53.906
Critical.

32:54.417 --> 32:55.406
Being a friend.

32:58.417 --> 33:00.408
what did you say?

33:00.417 --> 33:02.417
"I don't want
any more excitement.

33:02.417 --> 33:04.408
"I just want to go
where the weather's good

33:04.417 --> 33:05.406
and watch kids play ball."

33:05.417 --> 33:06.907
Isn't that what you said?

33:08.917 --> 33:11.408
That was what I wanted.

33:11.417 --> 33:13.954
it. well, then do

33:13.959 --> 33:15.950
Just walk away.

33:16.959 --> 33:18.415
Look,

33:18.417 --> 33:21.955
I got three-quarters
of a million here.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.415
Ain't about money, pal.

33:25.417 --> 33:29.956
Jimmy, he's got some
information we need.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.950
Once we've got it,

33:31.959 --> 33:33.950
we'll take care of him.

33:33.959 --> 33:35.950
with a jury.

33:35.959 --> 33:39.451
It's a contract,
and I got no choice.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.949
Me, neither.

33:41.959 --> 33:43.449
I'm not moving, Jimmy.

33:54.001 --> 33:56.447
Ah.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.449
The bum's yours.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.493
Hey! Hey!

34:12.500 --> 34:13.989
wait a minute! Hold it!

34:14.001 --> 34:15.491
what, are you, ungrateful?

34:16.001 --> 34:17.491
You know, for a smart guy,
you're not

34:17.500 --> 34:19.491
too bright, are ya?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.991
Come on.

34:22.001 --> 34:24.492
Jimmy, I wasn't
so sure you were...

34:40.500 --> 34:42.491
Jimmy didn't ice him,
Mr. Banning.

34:43.000 --> 34:43.989
That's what I'm saying.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.489
Simmons is going
to sing to the Feds.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.491
Sing?
He's going to doPagliacci?

34:48.500 --> 34:50.991
I gave Jimmy his start
in the business.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.991
You sure about this?

34:53.000 --> 34:53.989
On my mother's eyes.

34:56.542 --> 34:57.998
The things I got to do.

35:00.542 --> 35:01.531
If you need
some heavyweight work,

35:01.542 --> 35:03.533
it'd be an honor.

35:03.542 --> 35:04.998
All right, Ralphie.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.999
I like a man with initiative.

35:08.000 --> 35:08.989
Kill Simmons.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.033
But, first, find Jimmy,

35:14.041 --> 35:16.532
and put him to sleep.

35:16.542 --> 35:18.533
Consider it done, Mr. Banning.

35:20.041 --> 35:21.030
Papa Chuck.

35:54.083 --> 35:56.074
It's open.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.573
Mac?

35:58.083 --> 36:00.074
Office hours are over, Pete.

36:00.083 --> 36:02.074
Loosen your tie
and grab a yogurt.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.072
Oh.

36:05.583 --> 36:09.075
well, you know, I was, uh,
kind of hoping for a drink.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.074
I'll pass.

36:11.083 --> 36:14.075
Oh. well, we did it.

36:14.083 --> 36:16.083
The federal agen
ts just picked up

36:16.083 --> 36:18.074
the East Germans
getting on a plane.

36:18.083 --> 36:21.075
Boy, that's one time
I would love to have been there.

36:21.083 --> 36:23.620
Like to have seen
the look on their faces.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.619
You know, I'm hooked
into the main frame

36:25.625 --> 36:27.081
at the Phoenix Foundation.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.074
Simmons' file
has been tampered with.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.074
That's why it shows
his father's still alive.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.620
Mm! This is great.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.116
Did you make this?

36:36.125 --> 36:37.615
You're supposed to heat it.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.616
Mmm.

36:40.125 --> 36:41.114
I like it cold.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.615
I didn't think you'd go in

36:43.125 --> 36:45.116
for whipped bean curd.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.115
Been trying to get
Jimmy's file to come up.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.615
Oh, here we go.

36:53.125 --> 36:55.116
Spent the last ten years
in prison.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.659
He's been linked
with Papa Chuck Banning.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.658
That contract
Jimmy was talking about?

37:02.667 --> 37:05.124
Banning must have wanted
Simmons killed.

37:05.125 --> 37:08.117
Yeah, but Jimmy didn't do it.

37:08.667 --> 37:12.114
So now
there's a contract out on him.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.160
Pete, I got to find him.

37:13.166 --> 37:16.158
Oh, come on, Mac,
don't get yourself involved.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.656
I'm already involved.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.667
Listen, Jimmy
could be anywhere.

37:19.667 --> 37:20.656
Yeah.

37:22.166 --> 37:25.158
Put that back in the fridge,
will you?

37:33.166 --> 37:36.704
where do you start to look
for a man who could be anywhere?

37:36.709 --> 37:40.156
A man with no roots,
no reason for him to stay,

37:40.166 --> 37:43.158
and one big reason
for him to leave?

37:43.166 --> 37:44.702
I started asking myself,

37:44.709 --> 37:47.701
"where would I go
if I were Jimmy? "

37:53.208 --> 37:56.700
If you've seen one ball field,
you've seen 'em all.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.700
I know.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.701
I must've seen ten of 'em
before I found Jimmy.

38:04.208 --> 38:06.699
what worried me was
if I knew him well enough

38:07.208 --> 38:10.700
to find him at a ball field,
so did Banning.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.199
Kid's got a hi
tch in his swing.

38:22.208 --> 38:23.744
Fastball will get by him.

38:27.750 --> 38:28.739
Reminds me of me.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.244
well, there's no use hiding.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.241
I got to face the music.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.741
You could try to
get away, you know.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.742
There is no getting away,
not from these people.

38:43.750 --> 38:46.241
There was this guy once,
Morrie Gluck, a numbers runner.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.741
They caught him
with his hands in the till.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.240
Friend of mine
got the contract.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.786
Morrie calls him,
asks for 24 hours

38:52.792 --> 38:54.783
to get his affairs
in order.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.783
They set a time,
met the next day,

38:56.792 --> 38:57.781
and that was that.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.241
Morrie... well,
he knew the jig was up,

39:00.792 --> 39:04.785
but at least he went out
with a little class.

39:06.792 --> 39:08.248
what, you're wondering
how it felt

39:08.250 --> 39:09.786
for me to pull
the trigger?

39:09.792 --> 39:11.248
I spent the last ten years

39:11.250 --> 39:14.788
thinking about that,
seeing faces.

39:14.792 --> 39:17.784
Maybe that's why
I couldn't do it no more.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.283
well, I'm not going to let you
sit here and just wait.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.782
I appreciate your concern,
but it's not your worry.

39:22.792 --> 39:25.784
well, I'm funny that way, Jimmy.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.280
You know, I'm glad

39:27.291 --> 39:29.282
that I met you
that day in the bar,

39:29.291 --> 39:32.829
but the truth is I'm tired,
and I'm too old to run.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.290
You know, there are
a lot of kids who'd like

39:37.291 --> 39:40.283
to make it to
the major leagues.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.828
You could help 'em.

39:42.834 --> 39:45.826
You do have two
weeks' experience.

39:45.834 --> 39:48.280
what, driving the team bus?

39:48.291 --> 39:49.827
Yeah.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.325
You know... maybe.

40:03.333 --> 40:05.824
Pipe dreams.

40:53.917 --> 40:55.908
Come on.

40:55.917 --> 40:56.906
Let's go.

41:15.917 --> 41:17.407
Jimmy, wait.

41:17.417 --> 41:19.408
They'll see that.

41:47.959 --> 41:50.951
MacGyver, why don't you get
out of here before they find us?

41:50.959 --> 41:52.950
No. Come on.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.449
They're still out there, huh?

42:30.458 --> 42:31.447
Yeah.

42:31.458 --> 42:33.494
Ralph and his.357.

42:33.500 --> 42:37.493
Dum-dums that'll open you up
like a cantaloupe.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.991
I tell you,
even if we get out of this,

42:40.001 --> 42:41.992
they're going to keep coming...
they're not going to stop.

42:42.001 --> 42:43.491
They're going
to keep comin'

42:43.500 --> 42:46.492
till they put me
right in the grave.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.491
Help me with this mirror.

43:22.542 --> 43:23.531
It won't work.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.989
I don't know what you're doing,

43:25.000 --> 43:26.536
but it won't work.

43:26.542 --> 43:31.536
Jimmy, you said they wouldn't
stop until they got you.

43:31.542 --> 43:35.034
well, let's
make them think they did.

43:39.041 --> 43:40.531
All right, Jimmy, don't move

43:40.542 --> 43:41.531
from in front of that mirror

43:42.041 --> 43:44.532
until they see you
and they start shooting.

43:46.542 --> 43:49.033
Then what?

43:49.041 --> 43:51.532
Hit the deck.

44:05.583 --> 44:07.039
Ralph, look.

44:08.583 --> 44:10.574
Uh...

44:14.583 --> 44:16.574
Come on.

44:33.625 --> 44:35.616
This way.

44:43.625 --> 44:45.616
Sleep tight, Jimmy.

44:51.083 --> 44:53.620
He's dead, Ralph.
Let's go.

45:03.625 --> 45:07.117
That Ralph is so dumb,
he'd study for a blood test.

45:07.125 --> 45:08.615
Yeah.

45:15.125 --> 45:17.116
Although I got to admit,

45:17.125 --> 45:18.661
I looked pretty
dead to me, too.

45:18.667 --> 45:19.656
Yeah.

45:21.125 --> 45:22.661
I owe you, MacGyver.

45:23.667 --> 45:26.124
How can you owe a friend?

45:34.166 --> 45:35.656
My boys tell me

45:35.667 --> 45:37.157
you did a good job
putting Jimmy down.

45:37.166 --> 45:38.155
Yes, sir.

45:38.166 --> 45:41.658
Jimmy the Eraser
got rubbed out.

45:45.166 --> 45:48.658
If I'd wanted a comedian,
I'd have hired one.

45:53.166 --> 45:55.703
I want a nice arrangement
sent to the funeral.

45:55.709 --> 45:58.701
A couple dozen roses,
some lilies.

45:58.709 --> 46:00.165
Take care of it.

46:02.709 --> 46:03.698
Yes, sir.

46:18.208 --> 46:22.201
Nice touch, Mac,
calling the reporters.

46:22.208 --> 46:24.699
Yeah, I think Jimmy
would've loved this.

46:25.208 --> 46:27.199
Oh, by the way, Pete,

46:27.208 --> 46:29.199
about that bonus
I asked you for.

46:29.709 --> 46:30.698
It's all taken care of.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.199
New name, new personal history.

46:33.208 --> 46:37.201
Tell me, why'd you want
to relocate him in Florida?

46:38.750 --> 46:40.206
well, I found him a job.

46:41.750 --> 46:43.741
Something I think he'll like.

46:43.750 --> 46:46.207
Hey, Louie, I need
some oil for my glove.

46:46.208 --> 46:48.745
You don't need oil.
You need glue.

46:49.208 --> 46:51.199
That's two errors on
one play yesterday.

46:51.750 --> 46:52.739
I lost it in the sun.

46:52.750 --> 46:54.741
It was a ground ball.

46:55.750 --> 46:58.742
when I was in the bigs,
we didn't use oil.
