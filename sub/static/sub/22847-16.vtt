00:01.210 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:06.632
- We have to live with the choices we make.
- And now I have to make mine.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.808
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse,
so she thinks she can't be killed.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.268
You're our grandson.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.855
His very existence proves
that you and I make it to the Lighthouse.

00:21.105 --> 00:24.191
Do you see what this means?
It means you and I are invincible.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.445
You cut into me.
You are not leaving this room.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.405
I come with you,
my people get away unharmed.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.406
I can agree to that.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.616
You want to bring Robin out of hiding
and risk her getting hurt?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.744
Our leader is missing.
We have to get him back.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.787
Well, we know that Hale
went after gravitonium,

00:36.954 --> 00:38.581
so, I think she's trying
to build a weapon.

00:38.748 --> 00:40.249
<i>It's a particle infusion chamber.</i>

00:40.624 --> 00:42.793
If the idea is to put
your ninja daughter into that,

00:43.044 --> 00:44.420
this is gonna be a long conversation.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.671
She's not ready.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.799
I'm wondering if your Daisy Johnson
is a better fit.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.469
She would be worthy of Whitehall's code
name for the project:

00:51.761 --> 00:53.262
"Destroyer of Worlds".

00:53.429 --> 00:56.766
No. No, stop.
You're making a huge mistake! No!

01:07.735 --> 01:08.903
General Hale.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.909
I know you're bummed the whole team-up
thing isn't gonna happen...

01:17.203 --> 01:19.580
but it still seems kind of petty...

01:20.289 --> 01:21.582
taking away my cot...

01:22.708 --> 01:23.709
my chair...

01:25.419 --> 01:26.587
and my Cap'n Crunch.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.006
That last one really hurt.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.803
And you're gonna destroy the Earth.

01:34.887 --> 01:35.930
So...

01:37.098 --> 01:38.599
I told you we'd get Coulson.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.686
And he'll pay for General Talbot
after he's turned over his Inhumans.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.313
But for now...

01:46.398 --> 01:47.566
I know you enjoy it...

01:48.359 --> 01:49.944
the feel of a new material.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.239
I've been looking forward to this one.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.367
The question is,
what do you want me to do with it?

01:56.951 --> 02:00.621
Whitehall, Strucker, even Talbot,
they all wanted your compliance.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.832
I'm offering transformation.

02:03.666 --> 02:04.792
Into what?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.210
A hero.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.258
Show us what you can do.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.512
Why hand him this?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.723
Talbot already gave up the location
of the chamber.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.810
Yes, and we're waiting for Strucker
to show us how to put it together.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.105
His father never made it easy
for someone to steal his work.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.857
- But Creel...
- Creel will give us answers.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.526
No one understood gravitonium
except for Ian Quinn,

02:30.693 --> 02:33.612
- and he's been in hiding for years.
- But if Creel touches it...

02:33.779 --> 02:35.865
Yes, he'll help us understand
what we're dealing with here.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.409
Before you give it to me.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.831
I don't want to infuse your cells
with something we know nothing about.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.541
So, then why not talk to Coulson about it?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.293
He has experience with it.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.129
And I think after two days in isolation,
maybe an olive branch...

02:50.296 --> 02:51.630
We've done the olive branch.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.841
We stick the screws to him now.

02:54.258 --> 02:58.137
A week without sleep and food,
we'll see what he has to say.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.391
Let's begin.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.379
Hey! Get me out!

03:36.091 --> 03:39.511
Hey! Get me out of here! Stop!

03:48.395 --> 03:49.813
What happened?

03:50.981 --> 03:52.066
What did you feel?

03:53.359 --> 03:54.485
It's alive.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.216
Mm. Hey, Simmons was right.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.468
She said you might become stronger
than before,

04:19.635 --> 04:22.471
- but you're murdering that heavy bag.
- Yeah.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.808
Feels good to not be lying
on a bed for once.

04:29.061 --> 04:32.273
Yeah, well, maybe... maybe don't push
too hard, though.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.275
We just put those things on you.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.402
I'm fine.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.071
- I'm just getting used to them.
- Mm-hm.

04:41.949 --> 04:46.495
Look, I know you like to do things fast,
but you don't know your strength yet.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.415
So, maybe a little caution
couldn't hurt for a change.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.375
I know that speech by heart.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.877
Well, you're the one talking
about how you're indestructible

04:54.044 --> 04:55.170
and saying you can't die.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.840
- How was I supposed to take that?
- I guess it was just, uh...

04:58.173 --> 05:01.385
- the pain medication talking.
- Yeah.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.179
Well, you can at least hydrate.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.807
Okay, Pacquiao?

05:10.352 --> 05:12.771
And later on,
I can run a diagnostic on those arms.

05:13.731 --> 05:16.275
What? Don't look at me like that.
What? I'm not babying you.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.861
I'm a mechanic.
A well-oiled machine needs oil.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.405
Okay, yeah.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.130
<i>I don't see it.</i>

05:39.381 --> 05:40.799
None of you looks like me.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.802
Well, I don't know what to tell you,
Grandpappy.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.680
I guess your daughter found a real man.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.892
Of all the people.

05:54.813 --> 05:55.939
Why couldn't it be Flint?

05:56.648 --> 05:57.691
I liked Flint.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.069
Well, that's a lovely sentiment.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.321
That's almost as loving
as when you had a robot...

06:03.322 --> 06:04.573
point a gun to my head.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.076
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.287
It's fine. It's the first move you made,
that...

06:10.746 --> 06:12.539
actually, made me respect you
a little bit.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.378
It's my kind of move.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.256
In this place, 80 years from now,
I survived on moves like that.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.008
'Cause it was kill or be killed.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.095
I know Johnson's still mad at me
about the whole...

06:26.637 --> 06:29.431
selling her into slavery thing,
but you got to play the long game,

06:29.598 --> 06:32.101
or else the whole world is gonna be
a vacancy, right?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.187
Maybe.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.398
And you say you don't see
the resemblance?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.568
Okay, well, quality time was fun,
but I'm late.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.778
I don't know if you noticed, but...

06:43.612 --> 06:46.740
ever since she's been in charge,
Daisy's kind of a hard-ass.

06:49.618 --> 06:50.619
I noticed.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.750
- Can I pick your brain for a minute?
- That's a weird saying.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.794
I was hoping you could tell me
more about our future.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.755
- I mean, you saw it. It sucked.
- No, I mean Fitz and me.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.758
Do you recall any evidence
of major injury,

07:04.967 --> 07:06.510
any noticeable scarring, perhaps?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.138
I don't remember you guys at all.
I didn't even know your real names.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.974
Everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. changed them
when they were getting hunted down.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.268
I just knew you as Nana and Bobo.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.896
- But you guys made it to the Lighthouse.
- Good to hear.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.234
Mum talked about you a lot,
but she never mentioned any health stuff.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.194
I'm pretty sure you were tiptop.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.573
You remind me of her.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.661
If you want, I could tell you stories
about what you...

07:32.828 --> 07:35.330
I think it's best not to know too much.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.668
It's enough to know Fitz and I
live long enough to create her.

07:40.669 --> 07:44.089
Yeah, well, you certainly will,
as long as you guys...

07:46.008 --> 07:47.050
you know.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.429
Uh... But anyway, I... I don't know
how much longer I'm gonna make it,

07:50.554 --> 07:52.097
if I don't get a move on, because...

07:53.182 --> 07:54.808
I don't know if you noticed, but...

07:55.726 --> 07:57.686
ever since she's been in charge, Daisy...

07:58.312 --> 08:00.147
has really just become a hard-ass.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.066
I noticed.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.945
- You sure about this?
- I understand the risk

08:07.112 --> 08:09.114
of taking her out of hiding,
but Robin is our best shot

08:09.281 --> 08:10.866
at finding Coulson. I have to talk to her.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.577
And look, I... I get that you're afraid
to see her again,

08:13.744 --> 08:16.246
- but she's the most powerful tool we have.
- She's just a kid.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.375
Sorry, I'm... I'm late. I was just...
just getting all my gear together,

08:20.542 --> 08:22.920
but I'm ready to go.
Geared up. Mission-ready.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.925
I'll just go ahead
and go to the command centre.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.888
- Was he late?
- I have no idea.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.599
- What's up?
- I was hoping to have another word

08:35.724 --> 08:37.017
- with you with you about Fitz.
- We can't have

08:37.100 --> 08:38.184
that conversation again, Simmons.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.980
Yes, well, Robin may have answers,
but she may not,

08:42.188 --> 08:44.483
whereas Fitz has a concrete lead
on a Hydra weapon.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.818
We get to that first, we get to Hale.
That could lead to Coulson...

08:47.110 --> 08:50.072
Fitz is sick.
You should be worried about that.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.033
Look, you can compile his intel,

08:53.242 --> 08:55.953
and we will review it when we get back,
but right now, <i>Zephyr One</i> is leaving.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.707
And, Simmons...
Mack is in charge when I'm gone,

09:00.999 --> 09:02.876
and he's under strict orders
Fitz stays locked up.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.711
Understood?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.130
I understand what you're saying.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.508
Good.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.013
You might want to dial it back.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.057
- I think she's wrong.
- You made that perfectly clear.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.852
But you're leading us now,
and it's new to everyone, not just you.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.438
I'm just leading us to Coulson.
Then he can have his job back.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.570
Daisy won't listen.
I think it's time we try a new approach.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.072
To what? Why'd you drag me here?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.949
Because I've realised,
we have to think differently.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.619
Fitz started to, and he's paying for it,
but you can't deny it worked.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.454
And you.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.623
Mack said, you believe you can't die.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.335
- I know it sounds crazy, Jemma...
- I don't think it's crazy.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.878
I believe it's true.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.216
- I'm glad someone understands.
- I don't just mean you.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.470
You guys didn't see yourselves
in the future.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.680
No.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.140
Deke is our proof.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.310
His mother...

10:02.060 --> 10:03.228
was our daughter.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.401
- Deke...
- Is our grandson.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.777
Wow.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.654
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.531
No, no, he's really quite sweet.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.367
Well, it makes as much sense
as anything else.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.078
So, we're the invincible three, huh?

10:22.914 --> 10:23.957
Now what?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.960
Daisy's taking a long shot
to find where Hale is keeping Coulson,

10:27.210 --> 10:29.838
but we have something concrete,
that can get us one step ahead of her.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.507
- That sounds good.
- Hale may be after a weapon powered

10:32.674 --> 10:36.345
by gravitonium, probably in a location
that Malick turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.555
That sounds bad. I'm in.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.183
So, we go to these places
and knock down doors?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.145
I can knock down doors now.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.897
I can't go anywhere.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.107
Fitz...

10:49.775 --> 10:53.570
I know you feel like you're battling
something inside you, but I trust you.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.739
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.161
- Why?
- Because I'm going to get you out.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.497
And we're going to go after this thing.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.292
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. We have a problem.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.379
Mack, he's the only one
that can open Fitz's cell now.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.757
He won't want to, Jemma. He'll stop us.

11:14.883 --> 11:15.884
No.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.719
He'll try.

11:24.393 --> 11:28.188
- It's far too powerful for you, for him.
<i>- Mr Creel...</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:33.110
How are you feeling?

11:35.654 --> 11:36.780
It won't leave my head.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.450
Whatever's in there, I can't control it.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.664
I think this is more
about what's happening inside you.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.709
What are you talking about?

11:50.127 --> 11:52.713
You and I are a creation of the old Hydra.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.297
That was destroyed.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.343
When the thing we identify with,
most falls apart, we lose our footing.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.345
We don't know what our next step is.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.849
I didn't choose to be created by them.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.852
But you get to choose now.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.063
That's not what this feels like.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.482
That's what you want.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.652
We're going to conduct another test soon.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.573
Whether you take that next step
is up to you.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.211
Watch your heads.

12:34.588 --> 12:38.091
Just try to get comfortable,
and we'll take off in a few minutes.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.302
Thanks.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.430
It's nice to see
Mr Fitz got you all back.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.265
It's good to see you guys, too.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.225
I... I'm... I'm sorry
to take you out of hiding.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.146
I wouldn't have done it
if it wasn't really important.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.356
Hi, Robin.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.319
Let's get you into a seat, honey.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.834
She hasn't been doing well...

13:14.169 --> 13:15.295
for a couple weeks.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.507
She isn't speaking to me.
She isn't drawing pictures.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.926
I don't know what she's seeing.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.637
Whatever it is, it's overwhelming her.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.306
I understand that feeling.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.934
Maybe I can find out what's on her mind.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.787
Good.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.583
Uh... Take these to be translated.
I don't speak German.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.294
Is something wrong?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.842
Well, do these have the answer
we're looking for

14:02.008 --> 14:04.719
or just more musings
from a Hydra has-been?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.014
My father kept everything separate.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.892
There's no single journal
that explains how the chamber works.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.563
Uh. Assembly, the mechanics,
the infusion process.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.231
So then, we're still missing something.

14:16.439 --> 14:20.360
I am trying to recreate these as fast
as I can, to understand it all.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.279
We may be running out of time.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.825
My mother just gave Creel the gravitonium.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.787
- A new toy for him to play with.
- Creel? What, is he the test subject?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.163
That's what she says, but...

14:33.540 --> 14:34.666
she's up to something...

14:35.542 --> 14:36.543
and I can feel it.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.880
She wanted to join forces
with S.H.I.E.L.D...

14:40.505 --> 14:42.215
with Daisy Johnson.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.260
The gravitonium is meant for you.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.264
- She can't make him into the...
- The Destroyer of Worlds?

14:50.307 --> 14:55.061
I've worked myself to the bone,
trained my whole life to become this.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.940
And I'm so close.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.358
I'll get you there.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.235
I'll work harder.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.070
I just...

15:04.446 --> 15:05.447
I need to think.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.538
<i>Zephyr One,
we're en route to you. Five minutes out.</i>

15:13.955 --> 15:14.956
Copy that.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.626
<i>- You have the cargo onboard?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.669
Safe and secure.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.092
It's okay if you don't want to talk.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.553
You saw something frightening.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.764
It's okay if you're feeling scared.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.808
I was scared of my powers, too.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.352
I couldn't...

15:36.186 --> 15:38.396
...control it,
I couldn't escape it.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.024
But it...

15:41.358 --> 15:42.359
it'll get better.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.444
It will. I promise.

15:55.747 --> 15:59.709
I wouldn't ask you to think about anything
you don't want to...

16:00.669 --> 16:02.712
but my friend...

16:03.713 --> 16:05.131
Phillip J. Coulson...

16:06.633 --> 16:08.760
he's the one who helped me get better.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.346
And right now...

16:12.263 --> 16:13.348
he's lost.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.017
And I need...

16:18.269 --> 16:19.479
I need to find him.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.942
Robin, can you help me find him? Please?

16:34.911 --> 16:37.831
Structure looks good.
Hydraulics are okay.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.750
I guess you didn't do any damage
with all that punching.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.711
Yeah, these things are pretty tough.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.006
Well, if the arm fits.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.677
So, you're making arm jokes now?
I thought those were off-limits.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.554
All right,
it'll be the first and last.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.849
I'm just glad to see that these are...

16:56.891 --> 16:58.101
in good shape.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.395
Yeah, um...

17:01.521 --> 17:02.939
I'd like to do more than...

17:03.648 --> 17:05.108
work out and get check-ups.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.483
Yeah?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.569
I want you to let Fitz out of his cell.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.699
Why?

17:15.326 --> 17:19.329
Because he knows about a weapon
that General Hale wants that uses gravity,

17:19.497 --> 17:22.416
- and we need to get it first.
- You know what Fitz did.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.670
Take it up with Coulson
when we get him back.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.466
And what if we can't wait for that, Mack?
Maybe it's time for others to step up.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.427
I saw myself alive in the future.
I want to use that to help...

17:32.677 --> 17:34.846
Damn it, Elena!
That doesn't make you bulletproof.

17:36.181 --> 17:39.392
- I thought you let go of that.
- There are things I can't let go of.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.853
Things I learned in the future
about this team,

17:42.020 --> 17:45.774
- about Coulson, about you...
- I don't want to hear about the future!

17:47.025 --> 17:50.862
Look, all I know is, right here,
right now, you're in front of me.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.408
- Safe.
- You can't protect me forever, Mack.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.663
Did you ever stop to think, maybe you're
alive in the future because I did?

18:07.545 --> 18:08.588
No...

18:11.007 --> 18:12.050
Fitz stays where he is.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.054
And so do you.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.149
I see the future, Mr Coulson.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.139
You can tell the general
there's nothing you can do

18:59.305 --> 19:01.432
to make me join her evil league of evil.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.476
I'm not her messenger boy.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.734
Gravitonium.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.322
It hates you.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.367
- It wants you dead.
- You don't look so great, Carl.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.327
If you're messing with that stuff,
believe me,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.955
you don't want to be the guinea pig
in Hale's experiment.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.876
S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as guilty
of the same thing.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.338
Experimentation without thought
of consequence.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.384
S.H.I.E.L.D. may not be perfect,
but we'd never do what Hale did to Talbot.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.553
- I thought he was your friend.
- What do you mean?

19:40.638 --> 19:41.973
You don't know.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.017
Talbot is Hale's prisoner, too.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.477
- She broke him.
- No.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.938
She said she was getting him care
no one else could.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.775
- Helping him heal.
- That's a touching story.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.153
And I should believe you instead?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.740
You don't have to believe me
because every few minutes,

19:58.948 --> 20:02.368
a mech guard comes to check on that door,
and it's been a few minutes.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.207
You have a choice to make, Carl.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.726
That's a choice.

20:28.269 --> 20:32.065
Let's see if your story checks out.
If it doesn't, I'll do the same to you.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.217
She still won't talk with me.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.097
I thought I'd have until she was 13,
before she completely tuned me out.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.269
- I'm sorry we're not able to help.
- Please, do not apologise.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.104
This... This cannot be easy for you.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.481
She can see the future,

21:13.648 --> 21:15.900
and I don't even have the power to know
what she's feeling.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.737
At least when she would draw,
I'd have a window into her world.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.907
Do you remember what her last drawing was?

21:23.574 --> 21:24.575
I have it.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.708
Do you know what it means?

21:33.251 --> 21:34.294
<i>No, Robin!</i>

21:36.337 --> 21:37.964
I'm not sure.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.719
Mum?

21:51.644 --> 21:52.812
Mummy.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.697
I missed you.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.540
I told you Flint would get you back.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.085
You did.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.714
You were right.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.471
This base is a labyrinth.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.515
- Is this the right place?
- It's the only wing Hale made off-limits.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.017
Maybe there's a reason for that.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.935
- And you can open these doors?
- Yeah.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.854
Just need to know
which one Talbot's in.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.439
If what you said is true...

22:36.606 --> 22:38.691
<i>Straighten up
and fly right, Hammond,</i>

22:38.900 --> 22:40.318
<i>You look like a damn hobo!</i>

22:40.943 --> 22:42.111
Pretty sure that's our man.

22:42.820 --> 22:48.284
You are in violation, major violation
of dress code 36-2903.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.371
Non-compliance.
Get it together.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.123
General?

22:54.582 --> 22:57.585
Good God, man! You sneak up
on a man like that, that's not right.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.337
That's not right.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.593
Carl? What the hell are you doing here?

23:06.302 --> 23:07.929
Coulson, what the hell is Carl doing here?

23:08.262 --> 23:09.722
He can explain it to you later.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.809
- Are you okay to travel?
- Oh, no, I'm not in the best shape.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.519
If your robot
hadn't have shot him in the head.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.896
If you still want to buy Hale's story
about that, too, fine,

23:17.021 --> 23:18.815
but can we agree this man needs
to get out of here?

23:19.232 --> 23:21.150
Listen to him, son. He's an ally.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.195
And I'd like to get back
and see my wife and child.

23:24.654 --> 23:25.655
We good?

23:26.239 --> 23:28.574
- Yeah, let's get going.
- Okay, Glenn, come on.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.868
Perfect. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.663
Hey, you quit it! Quit being so handsy!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.082
Glenn, I know we're under a bit
of strain here,

23:36.374 --> 23:38.167
but I'm gonna need you to use
your inside voice.

23:38.459 --> 23:42.004
- This is my inside voice!
- Okay. Then your softer inside voice.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.549
Elena, you know I don't like surprises.
Where you taking me?

23:44.715 --> 23:46.843
If I can't convince you,
someone else will.

23:58.563 --> 23:59.897
What the hell is this?

24:00.690 --> 24:03.568
An experiment. The test of a hypothesis.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.864
If that hypothesis is true,
you'll see that you should let Fitz out.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.158
I already gave you my answer on that.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.452
Yeah, but we want you to reconsider
with all the facts,

24:12.618 --> 24:14.954
so, I'm going to prove
that I can't be killed.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.497
What, you too, Simmons?

24:17.290 --> 24:19.834
- Do you know how all this sounds?
- Like science.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.712
No, sounds like you're detached
from reality.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.173
Don't look at me.
I don't know what she's doing.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.926
Well, what's an experiment
without a little skepticism?

24:29.635 --> 24:31.721
So, each of these beakers
contain a liquid.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.055
Three of them contain water,

24:33.264 --> 24:36.392
the fourth holds a phosphoric-acid
compound used in the hydraulics

24:36.559 --> 24:39.479
of Yo-Yo's arms. Highly toxic.
One sip will make you sick.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.689
I mean, this much will surely kill you.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.149
What the hell.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.859
Jemma.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.278
- No.
- Yes, Fitz.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.114
I wouldn't be doing this
if the science wasn't sound.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.117
So, without knowing which is which,
I will drink three of them,

24:53.242 --> 24:54.535
and since I can't be killed,

24:54.744 --> 24:57.455
I will happen to consume
the three that just hold water.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.290
This is insane.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.424
- No looking.
- I'm not looking.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.551
Are you kidding... Simmons.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.720
Are you serious?

25:14.722 --> 25:15.765
Ready.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.564
Don't do it.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.444
- He's right. Jemma, J...
- Don't. Don't. Simm...

25:35.493 --> 25:38.246
Simmons...
Simmons, I need you to stop right now!

25:43.793 --> 25:46.003
No! Oh, jeez!

25:53.386 --> 25:54.762
I will now drink the last one.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.681
And it will be water.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.391
- No.
- No.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.938
You would shoot me just to keep me
from dying?

26:04.188 --> 26:07.024
No, I... I'll wound you to stop
this madness.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.443
No.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.195
I don't think you will.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.531
Simmons, please.
Please, Simmons, please don't.

26:13.698 --> 26:14.824
- Jemma...
- Stop!

26:27.336 --> 26:28.379
Fitz.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.591
Jemma?

26:33.009 --> 26:35.177
Jemma!

26:35.553 --> 26:37.930
Jemma!

26:41.851 --> 26:44.395
Simmons! Fitz! Fitz, what do I do?

26:44.562 --> 26:47.523
She needs some alkaloid phosphate
to counteract the toxicity!

26:47.690 --> 26:49.775
- Okay, but where do I find that?
- I know where it is!

26:49.942 --> 26:51.277
- Let me out!
- Let him out!

26:51.902 --> 26:53.613
Please! Let him out!

26:57.617 --> 26:59.619
- Hang on, Jemma!
- Hurry up!

27:02.997 --> 27:06.834
Elena, open the door!
Now! Open the door!

27:07.168 --> 27:09.003
Open the door now! Ele...

27:20.014 --> 27:21.807
A heads-up would've been nice.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.477
You sca...

27:25.603 --> 27:26.687
Here.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.026
Compliments on the performance,
Dame Judi Dench.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.072
That's the longest
you ever kept a lie going.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.158
It wasn't all a lie, Fitz.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.548
I might've chosen that one.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.467
I didn't.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.095
Because we are invincible.

27:59.637 --> 28:00.805
And crazy...

28:01.305 --> 28:02.431
apparently.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.558
Let me out of here.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.022
I'm sorry, Mack.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.109
I know you don't understand.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.113
- But I'm doing this to keep you safe.
- You're right.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.657
I don't understand.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.620
If, for some reason, I don't come back,

28:24.912 --> 28:26.706
- it means...
- We've broken the time loop.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.875
You know my feelings on that.
It can't be broken.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.878
Is that what you'd tell our daughter,
that her world can't be changed?

28:33.087 --> 28:34.922
- Maybe, don't know. Haven't met her yet.
- Oh, for goodness sake.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.757
- So, maybe when I clear up...
- Guys, guys!

28:37.675 --> 28:38.676
You'll argue on the way.

28:39.135 --> 28:42.430
But if you really believe that, Fitz,
then it means we're in no danger...

28:51.647 --> 28:52.773
I'm just getting...

28:53.107 --> 28:54.358
used to my fingers.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.780
I'll get that.

29:00.781 --> 29:01.907
That was close.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.119
Let's go.

29:20.468 --> 29:21.719
I'm glad you're here.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.724
Me, too.

29:33.397 --> 29:34.398
Robin?

29:37.234 --> 29:39.403
Is this why you had stopped
drawing before?

29:41.572 --> 29:42.990
Because of what it shows?

29:50.456 --> 29:55.419
We are going to try to make sure
that this future never happens, okay?

29:56.670 --> 30:00.216
- And to do that, we have to find...
- Phillip J. Coulson.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.135
He can put all the pieces together.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.262
Yes.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.058
But... he's lost and...

30:10.476 --> 30:11.602
I'm lost without him.

30:13.354 --> 30:14.396
Daisy, too.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.567
- That's why you need each other so much.
- Yeah.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.490
He's gonna die.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.579
You can see that?

30:40.548 --> 30:41.632
Hey.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.092
We can save him.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.199
Well, once again, my life depends
on a crayon drawing

31:07.366 --> 31:08.951
of a crazy person, which is...

31:09.952 --> 31:11.245
great for me.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.330
Is May still with her?

31:14.415 --> 31:16.834
Yeah. I just cannot imagine bouncing
back and forth,

31:17.001 --> 31:19.837
between the past and the future like that.
It sounds terrible.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.798
God, finally, someone gets it.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.385
Thank you for saying that,
'cause it's been like a pretzel up here

31:26.552 --> 31:28.304
ever since I met up
with you time travellers.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.055
Yeah, I was talking about...

31:31.265 --> 31:32.141
Robin.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.685
I'm sorry about your...

31:35.686 --> 31:37.062
brain.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.361
- Coulson.
- Yeah, she's seen him.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.864
Okay, let's start searching
for landmarks that might match.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.206
It won't be easy.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.500
But that might be where he is.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.558
- I was brought in this way.
- From where?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.602
Any idea where this bunker's located?

32:16.977 --> 32:19.855
No, I don't know. I was kept in the dark,
just like you, when I was brought in.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.067
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.653
Are you okay?

32:26.612 --> 32:27.738
Can you hear them arguing?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.034
No.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.202
What do you hear?

32:33.827 --> 32:35.371
It's nothing. Let's keep moving.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.586
What's wrong with him, anyway?

32:43.170 --> 32:44.171
Shh!

32:44.838 --> 32:47.174
I'm not the only one
with a cooked noodle.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.426
<i>Hey, keep your hands off of me.</i>

32:56.392 --> 32:57.643
You need to eat.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.606
There'll be time to eat
after I've reconstructed this.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.112
- What's that?
- Ruby?

33:09.613 --> 33:12.074
Creel has broken out Talbot and Coulson.
They're trying to escape.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.994
Gear up and stop them.
We need Creel alive.

33:16.245 --> 33:20.040
You, secure Strucker.
The rest of you, go with her.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.836
Ruby...

33:25.129 --> 33:27.214
- alive.
- I heard you.

33:35.723 --> 33:36.724
So, where are we going?

33:36.890 --> 33:39.768
We have coordinates to three locations,
so, we'll start with the closest

33:39.852 --> 33:41.395
and hope we don't find company
when we get there.

33:41.562 --> 33:42.604
Wait...

33:43.022 --> 33:47.234
- what about our pilot?
- We have an autopilot, which I designed.

33:52.740 --> 33:53.949
What's the worst that can happen?

33:54.366 --> 33:55.784
They'll be on us in seconds.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.828
Stay behind me.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.319
Fallen hero.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.029
Fallen hero.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.364
He took a shot right to the ticker.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.952
I've got no pulse.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.081
Oh, my God.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.250
Do something, son.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.379
- Do something!
- They never agree on anything.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.132
- You're feeling it now!
- But they agree I shouldn't help him.

34:52.424 --> 34:56.804
"They"? Who's "They"? We got a man down.
Come on, soldier! Do something!

35:20.702 --> 35:22.746
You know, you die more than anybody
I've ever met.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.332
Who do I have to thank?

35:28.043 --> 35:29.044
Thanks, Carl.

35:31.755 --> 35:32.881
It's time to go.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.096
Nope. Nope. This way. This way.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.272
If you're thinking of blonde jokes,
now's not the time.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.065
- I got a bunch of 'em.
- Go! Go!

35:50.941 --> 35:51.984
Fire!

36:08.083 --> 36:11.879
I wish we had time to take you both back
into hiding, but we'll keep you safe here.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.964
I'm just glad that Robin was able
to help you.

36:14.173 --> 36:18.218
Me, too. We think she might've given us
a location. We'll see what we can find.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.053
Can I ask you something?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.266
I don't understand everything
that's happened here today...

36:24.808 --> 36:27.769
but Robin clearly has a connection
with you.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.230
I, uh...

36:30.856 --> 36:34.067
don't know if I can explain it.
I don't fully understand it myself.

36:34.735 --> 36:35.903
You don't have to.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.030
I've seen the drawings.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.574
I know that I'm not in them.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.830
- If anything happens to me...
- Listen...

36:48.749 --> 36:50.876
That's not gonna happen. Okay?

36:52.336 --> 36:54.421
Come sit next to me, Mummy.

37:22.324 --> 37:25.118
I don't know how to get us out.
She's blocking the only exit I know.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.995
I guess this is how it's gonna end.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.456
Pinned down like Butch and Sundance.

37:30.415 --> 37:34.419
Maybe that's a cliff we can jump off.
Carl, can you open this door, too?

37:45.055 --> 37:47.099
Yeah.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.643
I've got something
for you to absorb.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.482
- I'll hold her off.
- Come on.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.528
Kill those two. This one's mine.

38:01.071 --> 38:04.950
Oh, no, no! I'm not interested in going
to outer space. I'm not a damn cosmonaut.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.619
I think as long as we avoid
the altitude dial...

38:08.161 --> 38:10.747
we should end up somewhere on Earth.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.000
You know the Earth's 70 percent water,
right?

38:19.423 --> 38:20.549
I think we need to try this.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.342
- Glenn.
- Yeah, okay.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.348
Oh, boy. Here we go.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.025
Stop!

39:23.153 --> 39:24.237
Ruby.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.510
Who the hell do you think you are?

39:48.011 --> 39:49.554
I'm the Destroyer of Worlds.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.060
Then go get them.

40:10.117 --> 40:11.451
We're on Earth, right?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.036
We can breathe.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.539
- I think it's good old Earth.
- Well, we're in the middle

40:15.664 --> 40:17.124
of God-forsaken nowhere.

40:17.499 --> 40:18.500
We should get moving.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.836
Hope hypothermia doesn't set in.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.673
Maybe next time,
send us someplace warm, huh?

40:26.425 --> 40:30.303
- White sandy beaches and the palm trees.
- That's not really my thing anymore.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.658
How you got through to Garrett...
I'll never know, but thank you.

40:52.284 --> 40:53.785
He learned to trust me in the end.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.246
And this is what I wanted.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.498
Yes, but why did you care what I wanted?

41:00.584 --> 41:03.753
- I mean, to give me this.
- This act cements a bond.

41:05.505 --> 41:06.590
Yeah.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.091
It does.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.845
You have my undying loyalty now.

41:12.637 --> 41:16.183
I never wanted any of that Hydra nonsense.
I just wanted the gravitonium.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.310
Oh, no.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.105
You misunderstand.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.361
It wanted you.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.203
No!
