WEBVTT

00:08.160 --> 00:10.594
Because this is what was there, Lana!

00:10.763 --> 00:12.993
There, where? Outside a clown college?

00:13.165 --> 00:16.566
- They have those here?
- I don't know! Archer, look out!

00:17.936 --> 00:20.734
- We'll never catch him!
- You should have thought about that...

00:20.906 --> 00:22.533
before you blew the damn drop!

00:22.708 --> 00:25.074
- I blew jack shit!
- Name dropper.

00:25.244 --> 00:28.179
And if you weren't so busy
trying to bang that waitress...

00:28.347 --> 00:30.679
you'd have noticed
that ODIN had agents in play!

00:30.849 --> 00:33.579
She was the hostess!
If you weren't blinded by jealousy...

00:33.752 --> 00:35.913
- Yes, I'm jealous.
- First step's admitting it.

00:36.088 --> 00:38.249
Jealous that ODIN's
gonna beat us again...

00:38.424 --> 00:41.018
thanks to your epic poon-houndery!
- First of all...

00:45.097 --> 00:47.657
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Great, good job.

00:47.833 --> 00:50.563
Shut up!
ODIN doesn't beat Sterling Archer.

00:50.736 --> 00:53.034
Only Sterling Archer beats...

00:56.542 --> 00:59.443
Did you wanna finish that?
Did you wanna finish...

00:59.611 --> 01:01.806
shutting your big fat,
negative-wordsy mouth?

01:01.980 --> 01:04.915
Whose fat mouth told the stupid
waitress he was an ISIS agent?

01:05.083 --> 01:06.448
Hostess. And I had a plan.

01:06.618 --> 01:10.884
- What, to get laid in the walk-in?
- Also. Because I'm not an ant, Lana.

01:11.690 --> 01:14.887
- I happen to see the big picture.
- Oh, really? Well, then where's...

01:17.296 --> 01:19.560
Kasparov? Okay, that was a fluke.
Ha, ha.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.199
Yeah, a fluke of nature.
Because I happen to have...

01:22.367 --> 01:24.733
perfect situational awareness, Lana.
- Archer.

01:24.903 --> 01:26.962
- Which cannot be taught, by the way.
Archer.

01:27.139 --> 01:29.437
- Like a poet's mind for...
- Archer.

01:29.608 --> 01:31.439
- Archer!
- To make the perfect word.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.441
- Archer!
- Goddamn it, I'm relishing the...

01:38.116 --> 01:41.847
- Ow. Way to go, Lana. Nice warning.
- Nice relishing. Ow.

01:42.020 --> 01:45.581
- Oh. Think that was ODIN?
- No, it's only you that beats you, buddy.

01:46.925 --> 01:48.415
Hey, gang.
Barry.

01:48.594 --> 01:50.653
Gee, thanks for
helping us catch Kasparov.

01:50.829 --> 01:53.059
- ODIN appreciates the assist.
Yeah.

01:53.232 --> 01:55.666
And if you ever get tired
of playing JV ball...

01:55.834 --> 01:58.132
you know where to find us.
- Oh, yeah, uh, where's that?

01:58.303 --> 02:01.101
Um, dick town? Ha, ha.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.240
Jesus, even their cards are nice.

02:03.408 --> 02:06.002
Lana, look at this. It's embossed.

02:06.445 --> 02:09.812
Oh, okay. Then, I guess, just pout.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.120 --> 02:50.213
- That was the mayor of Paris...
- Name dropper.

02:50.389 --> 02:53.381
- Who was just as eager as I am
to know why ISIS agents...

02:53.559 --> 02:56.255
were terrorizing Paris!
- So I crashed a few cop cars...

02:56.428 --> 02:58.328
ran over a few mimes!

02:58.497 --> 03:01.591
So I don't play by the rules,
Mother, but I get results!

03:01.767 --> 03:03.894
Well, as long as you got Kasparov.

03:04.069 --> 03:06.503
Oh, uh, yeah, about that...

03:07.873 --> 03:09.602
That's why she can't have nice things.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.970
- Either that or I steal them. What?
- Hm? What's that?

03:12.144 --> 03:14.669
Hm? What do you want?
I'm a little busy for chitchat.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.244
- Busy trying to turn that thing on?
- Look at this!

03:17.416 --> 03:20.476
- O-N. Nothing.
- Well, just keep at it.

03:20.652 --> 03:23.052
- You're not my supervisor!
I'm sorry, what?

03:23.221 --> 03:25.451
He sort of offered me a job at ODIN.

03:25.624 --> 03:26.648
- Barry Dillon?
- Uh...

03:26.825 --> 03:29.157
Barry "We have this whole
huge history together" Dillon?

03:29.328 --> 03:31.387
We don't have this whole huge history.

03:31.563 --> 03:34.828
- Oh. Oh, my God. Barry.
- Oh, yeah, right. Pretty sweet, huh?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.992
Using a mirror to reflect
the laser beam back into the laser?

03:38.170 --> 03:40.502
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, sorry, it took so long.

03:40.672 --> 03:43.903
- And that I'm accidentally inside you.
- Not a problem.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.406
- But...
- I just wanna keep my options open!

03:47.579 --> 03:49.877
So you can't breathe
a word of this to Malory.

03:50.048 --> 03:51.777
You know how she gets.

03:51.950 --> 03:54.214
ODIN?
- Well, since I'm not appreciated here...

03:54.386 --> 03:55.853
What's to appreciate?

03:56.021 --> 03:58.751
Exactly! That's indicative
of your whole attitude, Mother!

03:58.924 --> 04:01.484
Sterling Malory Archer, you are...

04:02.928 --> 04:06.364
of course free to pursue your options.
- My... Wait, hang on.

04:06.531 --> 04:09.864
And if ODIN made you a better offer,
what kind of mother would I be...

04:10.035 --> 04:11.764
if I stood in the way
of your happiness?

04:11.937 --> 04:14.599
Uh... Wait, what just happened here?

04:14.773 --> 04:17.298
Fine! She thinks I won't go?
Well, guess what!

04:17.476 --> 04:20.070
- I don't need her!
- I, however, do need your keycard.

04:20.245 --> 04:23.214
Yeah, hi, Barry Dillon please?
Yes, I'll hold!

04:23.382 --> 04:26.044
Oh, and just wait till I get to ODIN.

04:26.218 --> 04:27.708
I will. Keycard?

04:27.953 --> 04:31.650
- Oh. Here! God!
- They are the stuff-throwingest family.

04:31.823 --> 04:34.451
Okay, so after I call your vase guy...

04:34.626 --> 04:37.959
Freeze every one of his accounts!
And then get me Woodhouse.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.655
And we'll just see
how tough Sterling is...

04:40.832 --> 04:44.097
when he can't suckle at my teat!
- Ugh.

04:44.269 --> 04:46.260
Woodhouse, she froze my accounts...

04:46.438 --> 04:50.033
and I need to get in my safe,
so open the goddamn door already!

04:50.208 --> 04:51.607
I'm afraid I can't...

04:51.777 --> 04:54.268
since ISIS actually pays the rent on the...

04:55.647 --> 04:58.980
Aah! Damn it! When did
we get a bulletproof door?

04:59.151 --> 05:01.016
After the Popeye incident, sir.

05:01.186 --> 05:03.620
Oh, right. Wait, so you kick
me out of my own house?

05:03.789 --> 05:06.587
Yes, sir. Although it pains me dearly.

05:06.758 --> 05:08.487
I'm gonna pain you dearly, Woodhouse!

05:08.660 --> 05:12.756
When I peel all your skin off with a flensing
knife, sew it into Woodhouse pajamas...

05:12.931 --> 05:15.729
and then set those pajamas on fire!

05:17.402 --> 05:20.337
- Hello?
- It's just you and me now, Reggie.

05:20.505 --> 05:23.167
So be a lad, put on some Mingus.

05:23.842 --> 05:25.275
Hi, Barry Dillon, please?

05:25.444 --> 05:29.107
Yes, it's Sterling Archer...
Oh. Yes, I'll hold!

05:30.148 --> 05:31.877
Oh, come on!

05:32.050 --> 05:34.211
We've got Ml6 in the semis on Sunday...

05:34.386 --> 05:37.219
and I am slicing it like a butcher.
- Just keep at it.

05:37.389 --> 05:39.220
- I think it's this new grip.
- So listen.

05:39.391 --> 05:43.054
Remember how you wanted me
to float that job offer to Lana Kane?

05:43.228 --> 05:46.061
- Love her, yeah. When does she start?
- Right?

05:46.231 --> 05:48.859
That's the thing. See,
I think Sterling Archer thought...

05:49.034 --> 05:51.366
I was talking to him.
- Archer? You're kidding!

05:51.536 --> 05:54.061
I wish. I mean, obviously
the guy's great in the field.

05:54.239 --> 05:56.833
- Ha-ha-ha. Well, you would know.
- Now, see. Why do you do that?

05:57.008 --> 05:59.340
Why do you softball them in like that?

06:00.846 --> 06:03.280
- I'm sorry, how's the leg?
- Hurts when it rains.

06:03.448 --> 06:06.906
And when I think about Archer,
and so I blew him off.

06:07.085 --> 06:10.020
No, no, no, Barry, you blow him on!

06:10.188 --> 06:13.248
- "On" as in hire him? As in here?
- Yes!

06:13.425 --> 06:15.586
It'll drive his mother crazy.

06:19.431 --> 06:21.194
Gotta be the grip.

06:23.769 --> 06:26.203
And you froze all of Sterling's accounts?

06:26.371 --> 06:29.738
- Domestic and foreign?
- Even the one on the Isle of Man.

06:29.908 --> 06:31.842
Oh, my God, is that, like,
Whore Island for women?

06:32.010 --> 06:34.410
- No.
- Then you just watch, in no time...

06:34.579 --> 06:37.571
he'll be begging me to take him back.

06:38.016 --> 06:41.543
- He hasn't called, has he?
- No. How you holding up, Mama Bird?

06:41.720 --> 06:45.781
Well, except for your grossly
over-familiar tone, I couldn't be happier.

06:45.957 --> 06:51.725
- Even if Mr. Archer gets a job at ODIN?
- Oh, please. ODIN won't hire him.

06:51.897 --> 06:54.365
After the stunt he pulled in Berlin?

06:54.533 --> 06:56.899
Well, whose fault is that, Barry?
Yours.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.298
You bust in, shoot two
good double agents...

06:59.471 --> 07:02.099
And you think an appropriate
response is to ruin my suit?

07:02.274 --> 07:04.538
- Oh, and my shirt.
- I'm sorry.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.803
So will you please just help me up?

07:08.747 --> 07:12.308
- No.
- For which I am pretty genuinely sorry.

07:12.484 --> 07:13.781
Nothing two steel rods...

07:13.952 --> 07:17.786
and 16 titanium screws couldn't fix.
- Come on, don't be shitty.

07:17.956 --> 07:20.117
- Yeah, Barry.
- It's water under the bridge.

07:20.292 --> 07:23.318
- Yeah, Barry.
- Because he's part of the family now.

07:23.495 --> 07:25.895
- So go put his stuff in his office.
- Yeah, Barry.

07:26.064 --> 07:28.191
Barry, hi.

07:28.366 --> 07:32.302
So I was wondering if your
tempting offer was still open.

07:34.272 --> 07:38.299
No, you silly man. About the job.

07:38.476 --> 07:41.445
No, just keeping my options open.

07:41.613 --> 07:45.242
Definitely come in. I mean,
we did kind of fill the position...

07:45.417 --> 07:49.183
but I don't know
if it's gonna be a good fit.

07:49.354 --> 07:51.515
I just don't see why you need this.

07:51.690 --> 07:54.124
Because this is a huge
opportunity for me...

07:54.292 --> 07:56.453
and I need to feel confident.

07:56.628 --> 07:58.425
In the interview?

07:59.231 --> 08:01.256
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that looks great.

08:01.433 --> 08:02.627
Yeah, it feels pretty good.

08:02.801 --> 08:05.634
- So come on already, take a cut.
- What, like, out the window?

08:05.804 --> 08:08.864
Don't worry about it. I get
a deal on those, 90 cents a ball.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.031
Um, okay.

08:11.209 --> 08:14.042
God, you're a natural.

08:14.212 --> 08:18.046
- Bet it's all that lacrosse at boarding school.
- Yeah, 13 years' worth.

08:18.216 --> 08:22.653
Thirteen years? What,
she ship you off in kindergarten?

08:22.821 --> 08:26.780
- Ahem. Gosh, that must've been tough.
- No, l... I loved it. Um...

08:27.359 --> 08:28.883
Made a lot of good friends.

08:31.329 --> 08:33.354
Family, almost, is what they were.

08:33.530 --> 08:36.557
Speaking of, how's your mother
taking all this?

08:36.735 --> 08:39.226
Oh, please, I bet she
doesn't even miss me.

08:39.404 --> 08:42.373
Because he'll be back,
crying for his mommy.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.872
Just like that Christmas
break when I moved...

08:45.043 --> 08:48.410
and forgot to give my new address
to his stupid boarding school.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.105
I mean, he rode the train
into the city all by himself.

08:51.283 --> 08:54.980
He couldn't pick up a phone book?
Nine years old, and bawling...

08:55.153 --> 08:57.621
in that police station like a little girl.

08:57.789 --> 09:00.883
- Ha! What's that tell you?
- Kind of a lot, actually.

09:01.059 --> 09:03.425
Oh, shut up. I bet you're barren.

09:03.595 --> 09:06.621
- My God. On Christmas?
- Well, Christmas Eve, technically.

09:06.965 --> 09:09.433
Well, the lovely Framboise from HR...

09:09.601 --> 09:11.831
...has some paperwork for you to sign.

09:13.805 --> 09:15.397
So why don't you follow her on down...

09:15.573 --> 09:17.438
to your big new corner office.
- Okay.

09:17.609 --> 09:20.578
Where the sofa is soaked in Scotchgard.

09:20.745 --> 09:22.440
- It, uh...
- Lf you know what I mean.

09:22.614 --> 09:25.515
- Yeah, I think I do.
- It's resistant to stains.

09:25.684 --> 09:27.413
- Right, right, I got it.
- Super.

09:27.585 --> 09:30.383
Because we're one big family.

09:30.555 --> 09:31.579
Ugh.

09:31.856 --> 09:33.915
- Why do you make that sound?
- Gee, let's see.

09:34.092 --> 09:35.753
You're off to interview with ODIN...

09:35.927 --> 09:39.055
home of Barry "Oh, I forgot to mention
the naked laser thing" Dillon.

09:39.230 --> 09:43.428
ODIN isn't some co-ed freshman dorm
where everyone runs around screwing.

09:43.601 --> 09:45.535
I'm sorry, Framboise, it's not you.

09:45.704 --> 09:49.265
I mean, it's not me, either,
obviously. But in the office...

09:49.441 --> 09:52.410
- You don't sex on the women at ISIS?
- Constantly, but...

09:52.577 --> 09:55.205
you know, it's not allowed.
It's probably illegal.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.076
<i>- But here...
- Here we are one big famille.</i>

09:58.249 --> 10:03.744
<i>Yeah, and the, uh, famille thing
actually makes this borderline creepy.</i>

10:03.922 --> 10:07.414
- Perhaps if you tried it from behind?
- Yeah, let's try that.

10:08.793 --> 10:10.260
Don't get any on that snappy suit.

10:11.629 --> 10:14.154
Don't you have better things to do
than mince around and gawk?

10:14.332 --> 10:16.994
About a million.
But Cheryl was scared to come in here...

10:17.168 --> 10:20.103
so I took time out
of my busy mincing schedule...

10:20.271 --> 10:22.205
to tell you that you have a phone call.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.805
- Is it Sterling?
- I am sure I don't know.

10:25.977 --> 10:29.504
- Do you know you're a little bitch?
- Will you remember this conversation?

10:29.681 --> 10:32.149
- Probably not, no.
- Well, then **** off.

10:32.317 --> 10:35.445
<i>Whoa, whoa with the language.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?</i>

10:35.620 --> 10:37.019
You leave Bub out of this.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.679
And how dare you steal my son
away from me?

10:39.858 --> 10:42.588
<i>- Steal him? You cut him loose.
- You cut him loose!</i>

10:42.761 --> 10:45.696
<i>- What?
- I want you to fire him, this instant.</i>

10:45.864 --> 10:49.322
<i>No, no, I can't do that.
He's happy here, he's making new friends.</i>

10:49.501 --> 10:52.026
- Goddamn it, Archer!
- What, Barry?

10:52.203 --> 10:55.036
I said don't come in here.
Framboise, what'd I say?

10:55.206 --> 10:58.107
- He said do not come in.
- Yeah, Barry.

10:58.276 --> 11:00.335
<i>- I don't care if he's happy.
- That's obvious.</i>

11:00.512 --> 11:03.538
<i>- Meaning what, exactly?
- Meaning, who leaves a 9-year-old kid...</i>

11:03.715 --> 11:06.275
<i>...in a police station on Christmas?
- Eve.</i>

11:06.451 --> 11:09.818
<i>- And he told you about that?
- Oh, we've had such great talks.</i>

11:09.988 --> 11:12.718
<i>- Fire him!
- Join him. Come work for me.</i>

11:12.891 --> 11:15.553
<i>- Have you lost your mind?
- Every time I see you.</i>

11:15.727 --> 11:17.160
<i>- Fire him.
- Can't do it.</i>

11:17.328 --> 11:19.694
Can't or won't?

11:19.898 --> 11:23.197
<i>- Either?
- Fine. Then go check your Telex.</i>

11:25.170 --> 11:27.468
- Oh, my God. A burn notice?
Look at that.

11:27.639 --> 11:31.268
"ISIS disavows Agent Sterling Archer,
a.k.a. Duchess."

11:31.443 --> 11:34.207
- Man, she loved that dog...
- "Who is to be considered...

11:34.379 --> 11:37.348
an unreliable asset and security risk."

11:37.515 --> 11:39.642
Oh, it must have killed her to do this.

11:39.818 --> 11:42.252
- Ha, ha. And I'm smirking.
- No, you don't smirk...

11:42.420 --> 11:44.650
at a mother's suffering, Barry,
you asshole!

11:44.823 --> 11:49.055
Ow! It's just, with the shattered femur,
and the gunshot wound...

11:49.227 --> 11:52.219
and I don't know if you knew this,
but Framboise and I were...

11:52.397 --> 11:55.093
kind of engaged.
- I did not know that.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.894
- Yeah.
- And I served her up like a pudding.

11:58.069 --> 12:00.697
- Barry.
- Well, engaged to be engaged. Ow!

12:00.872 --> 12:04.569
Ass. If you love it, put a ring on it.
Okay, so you go fix this.

12:04.742 --> 12:06.676
You know, I'm not even sure
I want to now.

12:06.845 --> 12:09.109
- She was obviously into him. Mother...
- Ass.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.805
- Not Framboise. Archer.
- The burn notice?

12:12.083 --> 12:13.778
His mother just sent that to...

12:13.952 --> 12:16.716
To every agency on the planet.
Look: CIA, Ml6, Interpol.

12:16.888 --> 12:20.221
- We can't keep him now, Barry.
- Oh. So...

12:20.391 --> 12:23.224
So you take him to the basement,
you put one in his ear.

12:23.394 --> 12:27.125
- Can you do that?
- Oh, my God.

12:27.298 --> 12:30.563
- That Framboise is a freak, huh?
- Yeah.

12:30.735 --> 12:33.135
Yeah, I can do that.

12:36.508 --> 12:37.770
No, as a matter of fact...

12:37.942 --> 12:41.309
I don't have Barry on speed dial.
Well, that's rather surprising.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.913
Know what's surprising?
Kissing you at the airport...

12:44.082 --> 12:48.212
dozing off in first class, then seeing you
on my flight when I get up to pee!

12:48.386 --> 12:52.254
- That, to me, is rather surprising.
- And really expensive, turns out.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.412
- Just...
- Ha, ha.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.660
Seriously. I mean, I don't
wanna sound like a jerk...

12:57.829 --> 13:01.890
but that Framboise chick must have been
a prostitute before she got this gig.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.533
- In, like, Bangkok.
- Ahem.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.259
I was almost embarrassed for her.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.267
- Where we going?
- We are heading down...

13:07.438 --> 13:09.599
to sub-basement three.
- Is there a shower?

13:09.774 --> 13:11.366
Because I bet I just, like, reek of her.

13:12.744 --> 13:15.042
- One second. Dillon.
- Oh, Barry, you getting that?

13:15.213 --> 13:18.273
- Really?
- I'm brushing it your way, Barry.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.111
No, I'm actually at the lobby
right now. Two seconds.

13:21.286 --> 13:24.585
- So wait, where are we on that shower?
- Head on back up to your office.

13:24.756 --> 13:27.088
There's actually
a private bathroom in there.

13:27.258 --> 13:30.455
Oh, good. Because,
like I said, I bet I just reek.

13:30.628 --> 13:32.596
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

13:32.764 --> 13:34.891
No. Baby, I am
putting you in the corner...

13:35.066 --> 13:37.125
where you will sit quietly.
- Hey, you.

13:37.302 --> 13:39.736
- Hey, you.
- And who are you?

13:39.904 --> 13:42.031
Cyril Figgis, ISIS comptroller and...

13:42.207 --> 13:44.937
And very eager to sit here
quietly in the corner...

13:45.109 --> 13:46.542
because he is so tired.

13:46.711 --> 13:50.010
Um, so I'll just be here, then?

13:50.181 --> 13:51.443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:51.616 --> 13:53.982
No, no, no!

13:54.152 --> 13:56.552
Who put out a burn notice on Sterling?

13:56.721 --> 13:58.382
- That would be you.
- What?

13:58.556 --> 14:04.051
- Ha-ha-ha. Holy shit, the look on your face.
- But I would never. Not in a million...

14:04.229 --> 14:07.721
Get a mirror.
- Oh, dear God, did I drink absinthe?

14:07.899 --> 14:11.426
- That bottle and most of this one.
- Until we wrestled it away from you.

14:11.603 --> 14:14.231
Because you don't know
how to share, beyotch.

14:14.405 --> 14:16.999
- Easy, tough guy.
- I don't remember any of that.

14:17.175 --> 14:19.075
Absinthe makes me black out.

14:20.745 --> 14:24.772
All right, you yellow sons of bitches.

14:24.949 --> 14:26.473
Let's dance.

14:27.952 --> 14:31.183
- It also makes you incredibly mean.
- And ugly.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.517
- Seriously. Danger zone.
- Beyotch.

14:33.691 --> 14:36.285
- Well, don't just sit there. Undo this.
- Ooh.

14:36.461 --> 14:40.761
- "Ooh" what?
- We can't, Ms. Archer. It's too late.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.834
- I'm sorry, so, what are you saying?
- I, uh...

14:44.369 --> 14:48.237
- Can you not give me a minute?
- No. You fire me, I take my things.

14:48.406 --> 14:50.806
Take all the things! Here, take this!

14:50.975 --> 14:52.909
Go staple my heart back together!

14:55.413 --> 14:57.472
How am I the bad guy in this?

14:57.649 --> 15:00.743
- So, Barry.
- Huh? That was Framboise, our head of HR.

15:00.918 --> 15:03.478
- With whom I guess I won't be meeting?
- No, she's gone.

15:03.655 --> 15:06.852
And so, remember how I said
we'd just hired someone?

15:07.025 --> 15:10.756
- Yes.
- And so remember Sterling Archer?

15:10.928 --> 15:12.623
Wait, wait, wait, Lana.

15:12.797 --> 15:15.960
Barry, if you touch me, I swear
to God I will put you in the ground.

15:16.134 --> 15:18.694
That was before his mother
put out a burn notice on him.

15:18.870 --> 15:20.735
What? Malory burned Archer?

15:20.905 --> 15:22.634
- Worldwide.
- Holy shit.

15:22.807 --> 15:26.573
- Yeah, so he's gone.
- Already? Like, literally gone?

15:28.646 --> 15:30.910
Oh, my God. I liked her better mean.

15:31.082 --> 15:34.347
He's gone. I killed my baby boy...

15:34.519 --> 15:37.215
and now my baby is gone!

15:37.388 --> 15:41.347
- Oh, now, you can always...
- Always what?

15:41.526 --> 15:44.893
Well, I was gonna say
you can have another baby...

15:45.063 --> 15:47.623
but you're all dried up in there.

15:48.266 --> 15:51.235
No, no, no, like, figuratively gone.
Unlike Framboise...

15:51.402 --> 15:54.838
whose car should be
blowing up any minute.

15:55.473 --> 15:57.771
- Oh! Ooh-la-la!
Uh...

15:59.811 --> 16:03.338
<i>May I help you avec your box?</i>

16:03.514 --> 16:06.642
- So Archer's still here?
- Yeah, he's in that corner office.

16:06.818 --> 16:09.412
And once Facilities cleans
his brains out of it...

16:09.587 --> 16:11.179
it can be your office.
- Really?

16:11.356 --> 16:13.620
I don't think
the cleaning staff does brains.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.918
I mean, you shoot him
and I get an office...

16:16.094 --> 16:19.359
overlooking the Champs-Elysées?
- And the bank where you'll drive...

16:19.530 --> 16:22.226
your new company car
to deposit your insane paychecks...

16:22.400 --> 16:25.699
and maybe, if you stand on those tiptoes,
your huge apartment.

16:25.870 --> 16:29.203
- Huge as in?
- As in you won't see your live-in servants...

16:29.374 --> 16:32.366
unless you really want to.
Let me go shoot this prick.

16:32.543 --> 16:34.568
- Wait. Let me do it.
- Really?

16:34.746 --> 16:37.874
- Because I would kind of love to.
- Not as much as I would.

16:38.049 --> 16:41.143
- You guys kind of have a history, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

16:41.319 --> 16:44.220
- Knock yourself out.
- These servants, if I did see them...

16:44.389 --> 16:48.826
would they curtsy meekly?
- Heh. Well, otherwise, what's the point?

16:51.429 --> 16:52.453
Archer!

16:52.630 --> 16:54.257
Come on.
Lana, why the hell are...?

16:55.600 --> 16:56.658
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lana, no!

16:58.536 --> 17:00.970
Barry, does this make up for Framboise?

17:01.139 --> 17:03.972
It does, Other Barry, it sure does.

17:04.142 --> 17:07.305
Barry? I guess, go ahead
and call Facilities or whatever.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.478
Because there is lamp everywhere.

17:11.648 --> 17:14.709
- God, Lana! Get on with your life already!
- Oh!

17:14.886 --> 17:18.151
- Telex. You got one in here?
- Why, so you can smash that too?

17:18.321 --> 17:20.153
- No.
- I'm pretty sure I'm financially...

17:20.324 --> 17:23.724
responsible for the furnishings.
- So I can send a telex from ODIN...

17:23.895 --> 17:27.387
to make the burn notice from your
mother look like an ODIN black flag.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.328
- Mother burned me?
- Apparently.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.229
Oh, my God, that's classic her.

17:31.402 --> 17:33.700
You're both classic her.
Shut up, get dressed...

17:33.871 --> 17:35.566
and grab the keys to that car.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.676
We've got about two minutes before some
ODIN dick sees this and seals the exits.

17:39.844 --> 17:41.835
Any way we can bump that to five?

17:42.013 --> 17:43.412
- I need a shower.
- Archer!

17:43.581 --> 17:46.880
Okay, God. Climb down off that rag.

17:47.051 --> 17:49.952
Oh, my God,
looks like Jonestown in here.

17:50.121 --> 17:54.524
Yes, Pam. Get me some poison.
Because I am already dead inside.

17:54.692 --> 17:56.683
Too dead inside to read good news?

17:56.861 --> 17:59.421
- Is it my obituary?
- Well, it's not that good.

17:59.597 --> 18:01.394
Give me that, you oaf!

18:01.566 --> 18:03.033
"All agencies...

18:03.201 --> 18:06.329
disregard ISIS burn
notice on Agent Archer...

18:06.504 --> 18:08.199
a. k.a. Duchess."

18:09.574 --> 18:12.099
An ODIN black flag operation!

18:12.276 --> 18:15.541
Pam, he's alive. My Sterling is alive.

18:15.713 --> 18:18.045
Oh. And look at happy little Mama Bird.

18:18.216 --> 18:21.208
Well, the blowback on ODIN
for this will be huge.

18:21.385 --> 18:23.979
- And I saw it coming. I knew it.
- Uh-huh.

18:24.155 --> 18:27.283
Just like I knew Sterling would
come crying back to mommy...

18:27.458 --> 18:29.688
wiping his snotty nose on his sleeve...

18:29.861 --> 18:32.853
like a scared little boy on Christmas.
- Uh-huh.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.464
Eve. It was only Christmas Eve.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.033
- I know. Good to have you back.
And?

18:38.202 --> 18:40.898
- And?
- And do you just plan to loom over me...

18:41.072 --> 18:45.304
all day, like some sort of henge?
- Okay.

18:45.476 --> 18:47.910
Well, you see? This is why.

18:48.079 --> 18:50.570
This is why we can't have nice things.

18:50.748 --> 18:53.581
Barry, you asshole!

18:53.751 --> 18:57.517
- How am I the bad guy in this?
- Because I wanted this, Archer.

18:57.688 --> 18:59.815
I'm sick of you getting
the best assignments...

18:59.991 --> 19:03.427
just because your mother is the boss.
Do you know what that's like?

19:03.628 --> 19:05.858
- Besides awesome?
- Oh!

19:06.030 --> 19:10.091
- Hang on, I think my car's on P-2.
- Well, I have to get Cyril, who's on...

19:10.268 --> 19:12.930
- Framboise, hello.
- Hello.

19:13.104 --> 19:16.164
Oh, man. That's bad.

19:18.876 --> 19:21.811
Yes, now. Let's talk this out.
Talk what out?

19:21.979 --> 19:23.947
How you ruined my chance
to work for ODIN?

19:24.115 --> 19:26.948
Or, ooh, maybe how I just
caught my boyfriend...

19:27.118 --> 19:29.780
balls-deep in some French chick.
- Ex-boyfriend, I bet.

19:29.954 --> 19:32.582
- You think?
- Yeah, he's not coming back.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.952
That chick was like the Pele of anal.

19:35.126 --> 19:37.117
- Archer?
- Sorry, I know this is tough.

19:37.295 --> 19:41.356
I mean, Cyril, whatever, but your feelings
for me are obviously conflicted...

19:41.532 --> 19:43.693
You're right, Archer, I am conflicted.

19:43.868 --> 19:46.894
Because if I had shot you in the face,
I'd be living here.

19:47.071 --> 19:50.472
- Getting curtsied at by servants.
- Yeah, but you couldn't do it.

19:51.809 --> 19:54.369
Maybe we both belong at ISIS,
you know?

19:54.545 --> 19:57.105
- Maybe that's our real home.
- That's what Mother said...

19:57.281 --> 19:59.841
about boarding school.
And really, sorry about Cyril.

20:00.017 --> 20:02.076
- Me too.
- Even if you brought it on yourself.

20:02.253 --> 20:04.778
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on, I don't recall ever seeing...

20:04.956 --> 20:07.049
a welcome mat at your back door.
- Archer.

20:07.224 --> 20:10.557
But wait, would that cheer you up?
Me and you, a little revenge-anal?

20:10.728 --> 20:11.888
- Archer?
- Yes?

20:12.063 --> 20:14.293
- You wearing a seatbelt?
- Uh, no, why...?

20:20.638 --> 20:24.130
So, uh, is that a yes, or a maybe, or?

20:24.442 --> 20:25.807
What?

20:26.377 --> 20:29.676
Oh, okay. Then, I guess, just pout.
