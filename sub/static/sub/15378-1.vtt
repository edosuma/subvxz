WEBVTT

00:32.083 --> 00:34.120
"I'm scared of the forests.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.164
"In the midway of this mortal life,
I found me in a gloomy wood,

00:41.333 --> 00:43.870
"astray. Gone from the path:

00:44.042 --> 00:48.331
"and even to tell,
That forest, how robust its growth,

00:48.500 --> 00:50.832
"Which to remember only, my dismay.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.868
"Renews, in bitterness
not far from death...

00:55.042 --> 00:57.579
All else will I relate
discovered there."

01:16.917 --> 01:18.954
- Don't go there. I've checked.
- And?

01:19.125 --> 01:24.120
A joke. Fine if the hotels are pricey,
but this one, not even by the seafront.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.659
But I called, I don't get it.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.704
- Try this one?
- Since we're here already.

01:37.667 --> 01:38.782
<i>Bom dia!</i>

01:39.250 --> 01:41.582
We come'sh for the room'sh.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.913
Auntie! Two gentlemen to have a look.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.825
- Are you French?
- Yes, like my aunt.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.036
How charming!

01:58.458 --> 02:00.574
...absolutely, one room for two

02:00.750 --> 02:04.368
or two rooms full board,
as one of our guests has just left.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.782
How long will you stay?

02:05.958 --> 02:08.199
- A week?
- I flunked an exam, I need to resit.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.286
- You're a student?
- Law. Third year.

02:10.458 --> 02:13.655
- Oh, studies...
- One has to cram, Madame.

02:14.042 --> 02:16.579
...So here you have a bathroom.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.541
And here's one of the rooms.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.366
What are you doing here, sweetie?

02:30.542 --> 02:32.829
May I introduce my daughter, Lena...

02:33.417 --> 02:36.330
It's breakfast in bed,

02:36.500 --> 02:40.243
and dinner downstairs.
It's a family business,

02:40.417 --> 02:42.499
we want to keep a certain atmosphere.

02:42.667 --> 02:46.331
Catherette will make the beds,
and give it a go with the...

02:46.500 --> 02:47.831
If it's all right with you.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.037
- Absolutely. Madame...
- Same with me.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.745
- And your luggage?
- In the car.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.664
- As for the price...
- We are two so we should take both.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.450
This is a family business,
gentlemen, so er...

02:59.625 --> 03:00.865
Needn't worry, Madame.

03:01.042 --> 03:04.000
Oh, the things I've seen...

03:06.250 --> 03:09.743
I passed a car park,
I'll see to the car and get my stuff.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.574
I'd like to take a walk in the forest.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.458
Is there a way through the back?

03:32.333 --> 03:33.994
Certainly, Sir.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.791
The gate is straight ahead,
through the garden.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.912
I've put some towels in the bathroom.

04:13.417 --> 04:14.782
Shit, it's going to rain.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.406
There was a bird, hanged.

04:17.583 --> 04:20.826
- Hanged, how?
- From blue string. From a cable.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.742
What a hassle to park.
What kind of bird?

04:23.917 --> 04:25.282
A sparrow, I think.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.620
Silk and alpaca. Expensive.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.533
Just kids. A prank...

04:29.708 --> 04:31.824
It's too weird for a kid.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.824
- Bizarre.
- I would say even more...

04:35.000 --> 04:36.115
Bizarre.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.119
How pretty.

04:49.292 --> 04:53.581
Tolstoy wrote that our biggest mistake
is to confuse the pretty with the good.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.616
Times are modern, aren't they?

04:55.792 --> 04:59.035
- So you want to say I'm old-fashioned?
- A bit.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.165
"Modern Times", a review by Sartre.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.246
- Who, who?
- Jean-Paul, a mistaken cross-eye.

05:04.417 --> 05:07.205
- An acquaintance of yours?
- Like Tolstoy.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.287
"Modern Times", isn't it a Chaplin film?

05:20.375 --> 05:24.289
- Isn't she pretty?
- Too pretty. Bourgeoisie, our parents...

05:24.458 --> 05:26.950
- What do your parents do?
- Dad's a judge.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.741
- And your mum?
- Housewife.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.286
A cold house.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.449
- This Tolstu who...
- Tolstoy!

05:32.625 --> 05:35.788
Yes, the guy who writes... who's he?

05:36.042 --> 05:37.874
A writer. Russian.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.532
Friend of yours?

05:41.167 --> 05:43.875
I'm from Paris. A rag trade slave.

05:44.042 --> 05:47.000
The hanged sparrow, Catherette's lip.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.662
- You know Ralph and Lang?
- Not really.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.457
- What's your plan now?
- To think.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.199
General Criminal Law.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.332
Dinner is served.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.456
Where?

06:12.792 --> 06:13.953
Downstairs.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.868
Don't fret. It always ends the same way.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.494
Well... me, you will notice...
Now I'm just a spare part in

06:24.667 --> 06:26.954
the hands of my better half.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.789
The dripping tap, undercoat of paint,
fallen leaves to rake...

06:30.958 --> 06:33.700
Master Lucien, my stepson,
if I may say-um.

06:33.875 --> 06:38.665
Married to Lena,
who is the daughter of my spouse.

06:39.167 --> 06:43.240
Fruit of her first marital bliss,
my charming dumpling.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.449
Oh sorry, my love...

06:51.833 --> 06:54.666
You don't find a hanged sparrow weird?

06:54.833 --> 06:57.825
Indeed.
Just last weekend I noticed a chicken

06:58.000 --> 07:00.207
hanged near the house.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.454
Lucien is a young architect.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.538
Laughable, these sparrows dangling,

07:07.708 --> 07:09.324
chickens hanging.

07:12.125 --> 07:15.288
Like killing two birds with one stone.
Well, imagining...

07:15.750 --> 07:17.707
- A sadist?
- A bad man out of work.

07:17.875 --> 07:18.956
Yes, a bad man.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.162
- Must you contradict me?
- I'm saying bad.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.906
- These are bad guys!
- The out of work at work.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.370
You don't even know what you're saying!

07:27.542 --> 07:28.953
Lena, my own Juliette,

07:29.125 --> 07:32.993
can you pass the radishing wine-um
to your stepfather?

07:33.167 --> 07:36.410
I recommend the radishes

07:36.583 --> 07:39.371
with this yoghurt, totally unique.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.614
My wife is a specialist
in home-made dairy.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.454
The key is in the way it ferments.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.740
The taste...

07:46.917 --> 07:48.624
I hope it will be milder tonight.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.790
It's the after season.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.492
The weather has turned cold.

07:58.667 --> 08:02.456
Mind if I turn up the TV?
The fashion show is about to start.

08:05.083 --> 08:09.031
What are you fussing about now?
Don't you hear daddy radishing away?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.495
At least they're ballsy, Ralph and Lang.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.870
At first things were sweet between us.

08:16.042 --> 08:18.329
Then I started pissing them off.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.788
Now I just piss them off.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.869
All day, they steer clear of me.

08:24.042 --> 08:26.249
All it takes is for me to cough...

08:26.708 --> 08:28.449
Around them is a huge bird cage.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.992
Babbling, gossiping, chirping.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.450
And me, I'm the rash. Hatred.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.832
Me, it's my parents who hate me.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.788
At least my father, for my failure.

08:39.957 --> 08:42.620
- And your mum?
- Silent.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.036
I hate law.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.116
I even tried writing a novel.

08:48.292 --> 08:50.283
- A thriller.
- Why a thriller?

08:50.458 --> 08:51.493
Easier to read.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.829
It was to be called "The Haunted".

08:54.000 --> 08:56.583
- "The Daunted"?
- It wasn't published.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.616
Well I shut down my computer.

08:59.792 --> 09:00.953
Oh really?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.665
I switched off my phone.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.244
That way they'll see...

09:05.917 --> 09:08.454
What it's like without me.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.413
Three weeks without me,
the menswear collection...

09:11.583 --> 09:14.575
Models, menus, flowers...

09:17.458 --> 09:20.655
Have you seen Master Lucien?
Handsome guy, huh?

09:20.958 --> 09:22.995
- Have you seen his hands?
- Yeah.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.198
Why hang it?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.161
Who hanged it?

10:16.458 --> 10:17.914
The Big Dipper...

10:18.250 --> 10:19.832
The Little Dipper...

10:20.208 --> 10:21.619
Libra...

10:21.792 --> 10:23.032
The Moon...

10:23.750 --> 10:25.081
I don't know.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.332
I'm scared of the night.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.573
Fuchs?

10:45.250 --> 10:46.786
Did I hurt you?

10:59.792 --> 11:03.239
How strange
that a thing is before, another behind?

11:14.333 --> 11:16.040
I am absurd.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.453
We'll have a lovely day today.

11:46.625 --> 11:49.117
One must make the most of it
when on holiday.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.875
Monsieur Lucien and Lena
have already left.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.414
Oh, thanks.

11:55.875 --> 12:00.119
Monsieur Lucien is doing up
a charming house for them.

12:00.292 --> 12:01.623
Very rustic.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.408
It's dragging on a bit, but great.

12:03.583 --> 12:06.575
Monsieur Lucien is having a hard time.

12:06.750 --> 12:10.072
Miss Lena dreamed of acting,
but now she teaches.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.457
They make a sweet couple, eh?

12:12.625 --> 12:14.912
Married for two months and still...

12:15.083 --> 12:16.244
In love...

12:16.542 --> 12:19.250
They stayed in their room all day.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.748
It was like their...

12:20.917 --> 12:21.998
Nuptial suite.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.123
Right.

12:23.750 --> 12:27.698
Mind you, now it's settling down a bit.
With time...

12:27.875 --> 12:29.707
<i>With time passing.</i>

12:30.375 --> 12:31.536
Oh love.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.745
Good thing it's not for me.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.915
What did she mean by "good thing"?

12:38.083 --> 12:40.450
Where were you last night?

12:40.625 --> 12:42.332
Monsieur was on watch?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.665
It's not your business.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.415
If you come back with a disease...

12:48.583 --> 12:50.073
I play safe.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.040
The senses,
even when they make no sense...

12:54.958 --> 12:57.416
We'll go see your sparrow.

12:57.667 --> 12:58.953
- Catherette...
- What?

12:59.125 --> 13:03.198
When one has a mouth like hers...
Manipulated, I could say.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.453
He, to himself, for his own.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.825
He, to himself, for his own!

13:16.583 --> 13:17.744
It was here?

13:17.917 --> 13:18.873
Well, yeah.

13:19.042 --> 13:20.407
The string?

13:26.208 --> 13:28.666
What about going to the beach?

13:29.042 --> 13:31.579
- I'll skip my homework.
- My pleasure.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.206
Wait.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.620
- Don't tell me...
- Ralph and Lang.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.578
- Borrowed?
- More or less.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.323
Like your chic suit?
You're the errand boy, right?

13:49.500 --> 13:52.333
- I came here in retaliation.
- Same with me.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.616
This pretty girl, the posh one?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.742
She dumped me
for an idiot from Grenoble.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.204
They always dump us for idiots.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.957
"The Daunted."

14:03.125 --> 14:04.115
The title.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.581
"The Haunted."

14:07.750 --> 14:09.366
"The Fuck-ted", right!

14:10.583 --> 14:12.540
You never told me what it was about.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.415
- A love story.
- Like yours?

14:14.583 --> 14:15.914
The opposite.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.371
Him and her,
like an apple split in half.

14:19.542 --> 14:20.577
Incest?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.616
He was her tennis coach.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.328
So she was the posh girl?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.992
Except the horror
came from a towel hanging.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.579
- Hanging where?
- A locked room.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.366
- And?
- The towel is moving.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.499
- By itself?
- It billows.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.408
On its own, it billows.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.244
Just a draft?

14:39.542 --> 14:40.703
I Wish.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.832
- Your father read it?
- He hated it.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.411
Your mother?

14:44.583 --> 14:46.950
She pretended not to understand.

14:47.708 --> 14:48.869
Hold it.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.828
So much water!

15:15.083 --> 15:16.824
Fuchs' idol.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.957
For me, it would be theatre.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.536
Louis Jouvet.

15:41.833 --> 15:45.497
The savage power of a stupid thought.

15:49.750 --> 15:53.664
The savage power of a stupid thought.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.282
Your bird?

16:20.458 --> 16:21.869
In person.

16:24.042 --> 16:26.625
Oh, for once to be seated near to her.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.661
First names, okay?

16:50.042 --> 16:53.114
Multiple adventure-ass,
pass the gas to your stepfather?

16:59.208 --> 17:01.290
Rapture of the senses...

17:02.208 --> 17:04.540
little smoking goose.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.623
So then,

17:11.791 --> 17:16.832
the big boss of my outlet.
Leon, dodging and contrast.

17:17.708 --> 17:21.656
If you're too soft with a client, dodge,
drop a dirty word

17:21.833 --> 17:24.244
in order not to get complacent,

17:24.416 --> 17:27.704
choke his peepee...
And toughen the terms.

17:28.500 --> 17:33.165
Yes, but who can assure
anyone of anything?

17:33.708 --> 17:37.372
Look, the secretary of the boss-um

17:37.542 --> 17:42.116
as dumb as one can be,
ratting the day she was at the boss-um,

17:42.292 --> 17:45.159
to tell him
that I spit in the paper basket.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.831
Yes, but...

17:48.583 --> 17:51.200
What blouse did she wear on that day?

17:51.625 --> 17:53.161
The one with the embroidery.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.997
But then one day, unannounced

17:57.167 --> 18:00.660
the big boss-um of the boss-ums,
the one of all the outlets

18:01.500 --> 18:03.161
and me already being

18:04.125 --> 18:06.287
the under boss-um of our outlet.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.996
So, I received him, I made a big splash

18:10.167 --> 18:12.579
with an elegant lunch,
best restaurant-um.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.203
And then

18:14.583 --> 18:17.450
when I was to serve him the vin-um

18:18.125 --> 18:22.289
I flung half a bottle on his shirt.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.200
Tie, vest-um, whatever.
Know what he said?

18:25.375 --> 18:29.573
<i>The boss-um oi the boss-urns
drenched 'm Cfites du Rhéne.</i>

18:29.750 --> 18:31.161
He said:

18:33.000 --> 18:35.958
"Leon, I see that you have been
to the right schools."

18:44.625 --> 18:46.787
Sorrel soup!

18:48.833 --> 18:50.574
With dill.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.082
Another delight from
Mummsy-the-Gourmette!

18:53.250 --> 18:55.662
With eggs hard boiled!

18:57.042 --> 18:58.032
The ashtray

18:58.208 --> 18:59.448
and the sparrow?

19:00.042 --> 19:01.532
I'll say it again: Catherette.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.372
- She's too simple.
- Nobody is simple enough.

19:05.542 --> 19:09.786
"The hand, the leg, the mesh,
what disorder."

19:09.958 --> 19:10.914
What disorder?

19:11.083 --> 19:13.370
This dis-order of the things.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.408
- And then she likes animals.
- Who?

19:15.583 --> 19:18.120
Catherette. The cat slept on her bed.

19:18.292 --> 19:20.329
Oh, because Monsieur visited?

19:21.958 --> 19:25.747
- Maybe she retrieved the sparrow?
- It can't rehang itself.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.324
I feel like I'm in high society.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.832
- Oh really.
- Yeah, I really saw you.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.287
The hand of Madame de Rénal.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.073
- Stendhal.
- Yeah?

19:36.250 --> 19:37.740
- I'm from Grenoble.
- So?

19:37.917 --> 19:39.999
Stendhal was born in Grenoble.

19:40.167 --> 19:43.740
Lightning fast,
Julien Sorel grabbed her hand.

19:43.917 --> 19:48.115
He dared. A Napoleonic conquest.

19:48.292 --> 19:50.784
The boldness,
a stroke of military genius.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.824
- Is that your writing?
- No.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.617
Lena, who pulses like blood.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.033
Oh la la, I've had it.
I'll go take a walk.

19:58.208 --> 20:01.326
The mouth that relates to another mouth

20:01.500 --> 20:03.958
like a star to another star...

20:05.000 --> 20:08.948
On the one hand, the ugliness
of a fleeting sidelong deviation

20:09.125 --> 20:10.741
and on the other...

20:10.917 --> 20:15.411
That two mouths
which have nothing in common

20:15.583 --> 20:17.870
nevertheless have
something in common.

20:18.042 --> 20:21.330
Saturated in night,
already steeped in the winter.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.494
"Modern Times."

20:23.667 --> 20:26.989
- Sartre was hideous, a toad.
- Another acquaintance?

20:27.167 --> 20:29.534
Except that he wrote "Nausea".

20:30.875 --> 20:32.707
And he refused the Nobel Prize

20:32.875 --> 20:34.616
for Literature.

20:35.958 --> 20:37.039
Lena“.

20:48.083 --> 20:51.747
It's only when someone new sees it
that it jumps out at us.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.033
"Yes auntie, I'll go tomorrow."

20:54.208 --> 20:58.281
Never will she, and I am very sensitive
on an aesthetic level.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.372
I told her I'd pay for it.
She's like my niece.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.829
I'm not letting down the family

21:05.000 --> 21:09.790
even if they are un-aesthetic,
in an aesthetic sense, out of place.

21:10.167 --> 21:11.749
A five-year drag...

21:11.917 --> 21:14.284
You just need to recut and resew.

21:14.458 --> 21:16.665
The accident, the bus, smash!

21:16.833 --> 21:18.164
Into a tree!

21:18.333 --> 21:21.405
And Leon this, Leon that,
and Lena, and Lucien...

21:21.583 --> 21:23.620
Thank God Lena found a decent man.

21:23.792 --> 21:28.116
Except they'll do nothing
with their soft little hands, like Leon.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.367
She gets that from her late father.
I deal with

21:31.542 --> 21:35.331
buttons, coffee, sandwiches,
salad, newspapers,

21:35.500 --> 21:38.083
and chops, and salads, and so on...

21:38.250 --> 21:40.287
and the tenants on top of that.

21:40.792 --> 21:44.365
The one with tuberculosis,
I had to serve cream all day.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.782
It's colder than yesterday.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.074
It'll be better after the rain.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.492
This after that
and not the other way around.

21:52.167 --> 21:53.157
Ti-ri-ri!

21:53.333 --> 21:56.621
When an icycle mounts a bicycle
it makes a tricycle.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.784
A sheet for this one,
an enema for that one...

21:59.958 --> 22:01.790
I've seen it all.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.370
Won't you help Catherette with the peas?

22:04.542 --> 22:06.032
And the sauce?

22:09.208 --> 22:11.916
35 years in the insurance business, Sir.

22:12.083 --> 22:17.704
But the collapse of the global economy,
the crisis, lay-offs, redundancies...

22:18.250 --> 22:20.787
So we had to make endies meet

22:20.958 --> 22:22.414
and we started to rent.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.416
17 years with a man
who can't hammer a nail.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.322
Pray he won't wreck himself
over the peas...

22:29.667 --> 22:30.623
Sorry I'm late.

22:30.917 --> 22:31.873
Did it go well?

22:32.042 --> 22:33.373
Couldn't have gone better.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.287
Imagine that he's a new Russian.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.286
Roubles in real time.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.994
The best customers.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.199
Oh no, this is my thing.

23:09.750 --> 23:14.369
That his first wife never warned me
who I would have to deal with...

23:14.542 --> 23:17.330
Well, she couldn't have,
dead as she was.

23:18.042 --> 23:19.498
I'm telling you...

23:20.167 --> 23:22.078
the caprices,

23:22.375 --> 23:24.491
a calamity for all this filth.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.578
Your scarf, where is it?

23:26.750 --> 23:29.367
Often at night
when he starts to whine...

23:29.542 --> 23:32.534
Rheumatism, angina,
his liver, his kidneys...

23:36.375 --> 23:38.332
Stop this madness...

23:40.250 --> 23:41.240
this debauchery.

23:41.667 --> 23:45.661
To think that Catherette
has asked for the day off tomorrow.

23:45.833 --> 23:49.952
Mind you, she promised to go
to Leon's surgeon friend for her lip.

23:50.125 --> 23:53.117
Leon doesn't know
how to change a light bulb.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.371
Oh, it happens to her,
when she gets overexcited.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.824
What do you think, father-in-law?

24:00.458 --> 24:02.995
Ten soldiers
marching one behind the other,

24:03.167 --> 24:07.866
how much time would it take to exhaust
all possible combinations of their order,

24:08.458 --> 24:11.120
putting the third
in place of the fourth, etc.?

24:11.292 --> 24:13.408
We can only make
one change per day.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.203
Three little-um months?

24:15.375 --> 24:17.161
Ten thousand years was calculated.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.119
- Scientifically?
- By computer.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.828
Scientifuckally, yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.367
In the scheme of things,

24:23.542 --> 24:26.705
what, where, when, how, why,

24:26.875 --> 24:28.331
with what?

24:28.500 --> 24:30.707
You don't get it, almost-father.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.491
- Get what?
- The organisation.

24:32.667 --> 24:33.828
What organisation?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.823
The irrational organisation
of the world.

24:38.625 --> 24:43.415
Because you think, my little birdbrains,
pecking at crumbs...

24:43.583 --> 24:47.451
Kaboom,
something like that can be seized?

24:48.833 --> 24:52.622
Bang, pffft, gone.

24:53.917 --> 24:56.784
Took me years to think it over,
me, I think.

24:56.958 --> 24:59.825
Since Leon Woytis
was fired from insurance,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.492
he does nothing but think.

25:03.167 --> 25:04.328
What about you?

25:04.500 --> 25:05.911
Ahoy, sailors!

25:07.542 --> 25:10.000
Ahoy, sailors!

25:16.042 --> 25:18.830
He's afraid of his ex mother-in-law.
No smoking!

25:19.667 --> 25:22.705
Have a puff,
what with your duff ticker.

25:22.875 --> 25:26.038
Just stop pulling my leg.

25:33.083 --> 25:36.530
- Your sparrow?
- He was there when it started to rain.

25:36.708 --> 25:39.996
I can't imagine
someone cutting it down in the rain.

25:41.167 --> 25:44.034
- And your chicken?
- That's what surprised me: vanished.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.198
Your watch?

25:45.375 --> 25:47.286
Fake. Made in China.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.994
It makes a certain impression.

25:50.292 --> 25:52.659
- And the Russian?
- Still Russian.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.958
When do we graze?

25:57.208 --> 25:58.664
He's gone off the rails.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.789
Yes, the hand of the husband
seemed quite well behaved

26:03.958 --> 26:05.824
but what do appearances mean?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.537
It all depends
on how he touches her.

26:08.875 --> 26:11.742
- This Madame de Stendhal was married.
- De Rénal.

26:12.292 --> 26:14.954
Your first name.
Where does it come from?

26:15.375 --> 26:18.288
- Mother loved Gombrowicz.
- Another acquaintance?

26:18.458 --> 26:21.246
I can well imagine a decent touch

26:21.417 --> 26:25.615
or an indecent one,
libertarian, furious, even brutal,

26:25.792 --> 26:30.992
because why would regular hands
not touch each other in irregular ways?

26:31.167 --> 26:33.033
Pretty boy, Gérard Philippe.

26:33.208 --> 26:36.075
To think that she lets herself go
regardless

26:36.250 --> 26:38.207
to worsen the indecency...

26:38.667 --> 26:41.989
If he had just hooked a finger
on her finger

26:42.167 --> 26:47.913
it would have been enough for both
to attain the supreme licentiousness.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.700
Supreme licentiousness.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.240
That sounds good.

26:53.417 --> 26:54.373
One evening,

26:54.542 --> 26:59.082
do you remember?
We were drifting in silence.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.366
- What?
- The corner.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.741
- What?
- What do you see?

27:07.917 --> 27:08.952
Nothing.

27:09.125 --> 27:13.369
This straight line behind the island
and the triangle close to the isthmus.

27:13.542 --> 27:15.453
- Isth... what?
- ...isthmus.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.912
- Remind you of anything?
- No.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.744
It looks like an arrow.

27:19.917 --> 27:23.911
The offshoots are flakes from the damp.
This line, so straight.

27:25.542 --> 27:29.080
It wasn't there when we arrived.
There was a spider...

27:29.458 --> 27:30.789
A spider in your brain!

27:30.958 --> 27:34.121
It looks like the arrow
in the dining room.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.823
What dining room?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.492
The one from just now, dammit.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.408
Pointing through the ceiling.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.869
I see a rake.

27:42.167 --> 27:43.532
A rake, why not.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.914
If it's an arrow, then it was carved
recently. I can smell it.

27:50.083 --> 27:53.405
Smell, you? You're drenched
in this nauseating perfume.

27:54.917 --> 27:58.114
Ralph and Lang. Monsieur Lucien
found it very good on me.

27:58.500 --> 28:03.415
I'd remind you, sir, that "Nausea"
is a book that you recommended.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.540
- No cat walks?
- Weather's bad.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.290
- Not going out?
- No.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.699
At least you'll stay in one piece.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.741
Passing a threshold...

28:17.208 --> 28:19.825
The two fishes. Why not three?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.286
Oh m)'-

28:39.458 --> 28:42.530
We forgot to close the kitchen door

28:42.708 --> 28:46.906
and Mrs Woytis cannot stand noises
in the morning.

28:49.167 --> 28:51.124
The day will be radiant.

28:51.292 --> 28:54.125
Lena and Lucien are already...

28:54.958 --> 28:57.950
at their house. To oversee the work.

28:58.667 --> 28:59.907
<i>Bom dia.</i>

29:03.833 --> 29:06.416
We could check
where your arrows are pointing.

29:06.583 --> 29:07.618
They're not mine.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.408
- And your sparrow?
- Not my sparrow!

29:09.583 --> 29:12.496
Whose then?
I'm an expert in human passions.

29:14.625 --> 29:15.911
A rake.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.457
We need a rake.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.115
I'll be right back.

30:35.792 --> 30:36.998
Hold it.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.198
Don't let go.

30:40.292 --> 30:41.407
Got it.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.125
Wood hanged -
one doesn't see that everyday.

30:48.292 --> 30:49.748
Chance, the wind...

30:51.250 --> 30:55.164
But the birdies sacrificed,
the sparrow put on show...

30:56.792 --> 30:58.533
It moves me.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.823
I will write it.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.916
- Why?
- Someone is screwing with us.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.666
- What if this was just a novel?
- Novel?

31:20.833 --> 31:24.326
Hang a sparrow, draw arrows,
hang a piece of wood?

31:24.500 --> 31:27.788
- Well, the rake took us somewhere.
- To a charade.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.074
A leaning for symmetry,

31:30.250 --> 31:32.082
a kind of confusing signal...

31:32.250 --> 31:33.991
I'm looking better.

31:35.708 --> 31:38.120
It's someone from the house.

31:38.292 --> 31:41.250
The sparrow
reinforced by the piece of wood.

31:42.375 --> 31:44.286
Now you've lost me.
A wacko, yes.

31:44.458 --> 31:48.031
Oh no.
So much effort for such a refined joke?

31:48.708 --> 31:50.540
How many unnoticed signs

31:50.708 --> 31:52.745
in the natural order of things?

31:54.417 --> 31:56.328
- Stupid jerk.
- You say? He says?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.581
He's breathing.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.582
- A swim?
- It's raining.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.457
Rain, that? Ha!

32:01.958 --> 32:03.574
A burn.

32:04.292 --> 32:06.329
Tell me the story
of "The Red and Black".

32:06.500 --> 32:07.661
You sure?

32:09.667 --> 32:11.704
<i>A burn</i>

32:12.125 --> 32:16.039
And Julien shoots Madame de Renal
who he'd seduced

32:16.208 --> 32:18.074
at the beginning, remember?

32:18.250 --> 32:19.240
He kills her?

32:19.417 --> 32:22.375
- He wounds her in a church.
- Why a church?

32:22.542 --> 32:25.534
He was a seminarian.
Seminary, you know what it is?

32:25.708 --> 32:26.743
Nah, not really.

32:26.917 --> 32:29.955
That most important thing:
they cut off his head.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.913
- That most important thing: love.
- A stupid title.

32:33.083 --> 32:35.450
- And they cut off his head?
- Yes.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.911
It adds spice.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.369
Madame de...

32:39.542 --> 32:41.579
That was a sweet film. Bresson.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.206
Luc Bresson?

32:45.125 --> 32:47.287
OphiJIs, Max.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.947
The guillotine, a hanging, blood.
For your thriller...

32:53.125 --> 32:55.207
- Really?
- A murder.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.616
I'd love to act in a Pasolini film.

32:59.583 --> 33:02.200
- "Theorem", seen it?
- Now you lost me.

33:02.375 --> 33:06.073
The story of a stranger,
who visits a bourgeois family.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.456
And?

33:07.625 --> 33:10.822
He makes them all fall in love,
father, mother, son...

33:11.000 --> 33:12.957
- Is that it?
- Oh no.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.615
When he perverted them,

33:14.792 --> 33:19.161
the young maid with whom he slept
levitates above the rooftops.

33:19.333 --> 33:20.243
She what?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.784
She levitates, you moron.
Like the saints do.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.912
He)' guys, you know rugby?

33:31.917 --> 33:34.033
Stop this, form a scrum.

33:53.958 --> 33:55.915
- Catherette...
- Catherette what?

33:56.333 --> 33:58.700
- Tonight we'll search.
- You think?

33:59.292 --> 34:03.411
Leon told me she'll go to church,
then have lunch with her girlfriends,

34:03.583 --> 34:06.416
play cards with them,
catch a movie

34:06.583 --> 34:08.072
and return late.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.581
To see what?

34:09.750 --> 34:12.161
"Star Wars". The last episode.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.745
How peculiar to call someone Catherette.

34:55.292 --> 34:57.499
I'm afraid of the water.

35:01.292 --> 35:03.374
I'm afraid of the water.

35:05.542 --> 35:09.786
So imagine, Mr. Witold,
that one day we bumped into her,

35:09.958 --> 35:13.906
me in my Sunday best,
fancy new hairdo, pedicure even.

35:14.083 --> 35:17.155
Even Leon was stopped in his tracks.

35:17.333 --> 35:19.324
And I tell it to her face...

35:19.500 --> 35:22.242
Cold fish mayo, leek vinaigrette
for you!

35:24.167 --> 35:25.828
Dumpling, are you all right?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.992
So so. My dumplingette.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.078
My Word!

35:32.250 --> 35:35.083
She is impenetrable,

35:35.250 --> 35:38.823
elusive, immense like the ceiling...

35:39.000 --> 35:40.286
Some fish?

35:46.583 --> 35:49.905
Then I said to my Leon:
Don't be afraid. I'll take on

35:50.083 --> 35:51.949
the ex mother-in-law.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.742
Lucien's coming.
He's on the phone to his Russian.

35:54.917 --> 35:56.282
Anything but this!

35:56.458 --> 36:00.076
You think you can do
whatever you please?

36:05.458 --> 36:06.619
Don't hurt Charlie!

36:06.792 --> 36:09.784
- He's got a mouse!
- That's why he didn't get it.

36:09.958 --> 36:13.030
- What?
- The fish! It makes sense.

36:13.333 --> 36:17.372
Charlie is Lena's cat,
but Lucien is allergic to its hair.

36:19.458 --> 36:21.244
Hello, hello.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.540
We were living in Lyon at that time,

36:27.708 --> 36:30.780
which wasn't good for his cholesterol.

36:31.250 --> 36:35.665
He doesn't want anything old.
He wants something ultra modern.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.616
I need

36:37.792 --> 36:41.330
a piece of wood and string
to draw a circle accurately.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.458
I've got a compass.
You can borrow it.

36:44.625 --> 36:45.706
Yeah, thanks.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.333
An architect's compass.
Very precise.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.493
Come, ghost, show yourself.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.538
That folds and unfolds
before my eyes

37:11.708 --> 37:15.497
so this hypothesis is like a breeze
that rises a tornado,

37:15.667 --> 37:18.125
like a spark that causes a fire.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.032
The hand of the husband.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.746
This courteous horror,
linked, unlinked, with her mitt...

37:24.333 --> 37:27.951
For this woman, who knows,
she could grow to hate this man

37:28.125 --> 37:31.948
with her irrelevance,
all her blanditude.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.241
- Can you say "blanditude"?
- No idea.

37:35.042 --> 37:37.454
- You're getting worse.
- Your black eye's healing.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.208
Yeah, it's Catherette.
A slice of calf's liver.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.203
The animal kingdom.

37:42.375 --> 37:43.911
The cat and the mouse...

37:44.083 --> 37:46.575
No reaction
when I mentioned the compass.

37:46.750 --> 37:49.333
The Abyss and confusion, peas,

37:49.500 --> 37:52.037
dumplings, toothpicks.

37:52.208 --> 37:54.245
- Words, words, words.
- Shakespeare!

37:54.792 --> 37:57.284
Even more severe.
Who wasn't at the meal?

37:57.458 --> 37:59.415
- Catherette.
- See, I told you.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.913
The order is being born before our eyes.

38:04.083 --> 38:05.699
And the shape.

38:05.875 --> 38:09.072
- Intellectual, your thriller!
- Sartre's "Words".

38:09.250 --> 38:11.241
- About what?
- His childhood.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.203
I never had a childhood.

38:15.167 --> 38:18.239
Thanks to Leon,
we were able to tour the garden.

38:18.417 --> 38:19.999
You feel good here?

38:20.458 --> 38:22.699
Homely, I mean almost.

38:24.750 --> 38:27.162
Father drank,
never knew my mother.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.620
I grew up in the street.

38:30.292 --> 38:31.953
I'll show you something.

38:35.292 --> 38:37.533
- It points at what?
- Pieces of wood.

38:37.708 --> 38:40.075
No, it points there.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.365
See something?

38:42.125 --> 38:43.456
See anything?

38:43.625 --> 38:44.865
Help me.

38:45.042 --> 38:46.123
Come!

38:50.458 --> 38:52.040
- Look at the axe.
- Axe?

38:52.208 --> 38:53.994
On the ground with the red handle.

38:54.167 --> 38:56.033
- You saw it this morning?
- No.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.415
- And the handle?
- A handle.

38:58.583 --> 39:00.665
Angled like this?
What does it point to?

39:00.833 --> 39:03.120
Catherette's room,
if you prolong it.

39:03.292 --> 39:07.160
- Isn't she on the other side?
- It goes through the walls.

39:07.625 --> 39:10.413
Look here, an imprint in the sawdust...

39:10.583 --> 39:12.369
The blade was on the other side.

39:12.875 --> 39:16.698
And there, these three pebbles,
and these few blades of grass,

39:16.875 --> 39:18.536
and here, this clothes peg.

39:18.708 --> 39:21.826
Someone makes a sort of rhyme
towards Catherette.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.368
Shaped like a triangle
directed at the axe, to confirm the axe.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.579
At this rate,
you'll have nothing to put on.

39:28.417 --> 39:30.249
So your thriller, how's it going?

39:30.417 --> 39:32.203
It vanishes in radishes.

39:32.708 --> 39:35.166
Tonight I'm going into town, coming?

39:35.333 --> 39:38.826
If I don't pass this exam,
my father will kill me.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.116
- In your book...
- "The Haunted"?

39:41.292 --> 39:43.954
- Who killed who?
- A father. His son.

39:44.125 --> 39:46.833
- A who-who.
- A who-who!

39:50.333 --> 39:53.780
<i>I'm alone tonight</i>

39:54.625 --> 39:57.208
<i>with my dreams</i>

39:57.708 --> 40:00.746
<i>I'm so alone tonight</i>

40:00.917 --> 40:04.285
I treated myself to a nice jacket,
my revenge.

40:04.708 --> 40:07.040
Dear friend, dear friend, just in time.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.665
- Oh, bleurgh.
- Pardon?

40:09.833 --> 40:12.746
Arnold. The dodeca-cacophony.

40:12.917 --> 40:14.828
"Transfigured Night".

40:15.125 --> 40:17.833
A variation... Sliding down...

40:18.000 --> 40:20.241
Yes, Catherette, we know,

40:20.625 --> 40:22.992
but Lena is not here as well?
Nor Lucien?

40:23.167 --> 40:26.080
- They're dining in town.
- With their Russian...

40:26.250 --> 40:28.082
Just the two of them.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.491
The sneaky combinations.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.158
Combines...

40:34.708 --> 40:36.824
Oh, what are you fussing over?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.832
Daddy is muscling again.

40:39.292 --> 40:42.250
Ralph Lang, here we are!

40:42.417 --> 40:44.954
Acting

40:45.125 --> 40:46.490
to create the real.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.157
To see!

40:48.333 --> 40:51.121
To verify! Verify!

40:51.292 --> 40:54.034
Oh, to enlighten!

40:54.208 --> 40:55.824
To make it all obscure!

40:56.000 --> 40:59.413
It the midst of the chimeras
of the night!

40:59.667 --> 41:01.954
- Sure you're okay?
- Why are still you here?

41:02.125 --> 41:03.991
- I was going to check.
- Check what?

41:04.167 --> 41:06.750
If they sleep, when they turn in.

41:06.917 --> 41:09.375
The things are indeed

41:09.542 --> 41:14.207
a kind of screen
and play with me like with a balloon.

41:22.250 --> 41:23.490
Oh, we could...

41:24.792 --> 41:26.999
we should... we'll get it.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.158
"Words, words, words..."

41:30.167 --> 41:32.078
"Caramel, sweets and chocolate?"

41:32.708 --> 41:34.790
"if you didn't exist...

41:36.500 --> 41:38.207
I'd invent you."

41:54.833 --> 41:57.621
- Look at what I found in the kitchen.
- What is it?

41:57.792 --> 41:59.453
A toad. Alive.

41:59.625 --> 42:02.822
If we get caught
we'll say it's to put it in her bed.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.707
- Whose?
- Your Catherette's.

42:04.875 --> 42:07.207
- Not my Catherette.
- And not your Lena?

42:07.375 --> 42:10.618
By the way, it seems
Stendhal was a skirt chaser.

42:10.792 --> 42:13.079
And Pasolini a wild thinker.

42:13.250 --> 42:14.866
- That's it.
- That's it.

42:19.917 --> 42:22.249
Did you have fun in your little garden?

42:22.958 --> 42:24.995
Now you look presentable.

42:25.333 --> 42:27.370
They are all in their rooms.

42:27.542 --> 42:29.749
We can visit your sparrow.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.703
I'm afraid of the dark.

42:31.875 --> 42:33.741
All the dark cavities...

42:33.917 --> 42:37.330
This toad is all about
its slippery moisture.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.288
A crooked mouth and a dark cavity

42:40.458 --> 42:44.782
encroaked with the sparrow in a sphere
of toady-sparrowy-Catherettery.

42:44.958 --> 42:47.290
I'm gobsmacked.

42:47.542 --> 42:52.742
A few more days with you and I'll win
the Nobel Prize in thrillerettery.

43:51.875 --> 43:53.957
That's not gonna work!

44:01.333 --> 44:04.246
- Two retards.
- Different songs, same tune.

44:06.167 --> 44:07.578
- Drop it.
- An obsession...

44:07.750 --> 44:09.741
Yet these crooked lips exist...

44:09.917 --> 44:14.241
They suck you in, spit you out,
from a face so smooth...

44:14.542 --> 44:15.407
Lena“.

44:15.583 --> 44:18.826
The full moon.
And my lovely erotic watch.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.241
Nosferatu the Vampire.

44:22.417 --> 44:24.158
I preferred the one by Dreyer.

44:25.042 --> 44:27.033
- Right, I have to go!
- Where now?

44:27.208 --> 44:29.199
A little rendezvous on the beach.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.740
Pasolini was killed on a beach.

44:30.917 --> 44:32.578
- Just wanted to help.
- With what?

44:32.750 --> 44:34.536
With giving birth, my chicken!

44:35.125 --> 44:36.615
Oh, you frighten me.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.744
All right, see you later.

44:57.625 --> 44:58.706
I'm dreaming!

45:35.875 --> 45:38.788
Look what I found at the market.
This is divine.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.289
It is exactly what we need
for the house.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.948
Why are you laughing?
It's what we were looking for.

45:48.542 --> 45:49.998
I don't believe this.

46:15.958 --> 46:19.076
If she'd been a child
with very green eyes,

46:19.250 --> 46:21.617
she could also be a monster.

46:21.792 --> 46:24.784
A childlike monster with green eyes.

47:04.625 --> 47:07.333
Unfathomable. Darkness.

47:07.833 --> 47:10.746
She fears or she loves,
or nothing at all.

47:10.917 --> 47:12.624
Or something else.

47:12.792 --> 47:16.786
Vile, sensual, cunning, shy, deep,

47:17.000 --> 47:21.494
coward, saint, sensitive, pure,
faithful, innocent,

47:21.667 --> 47:24.079
cheeky, coquettish.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.082
Or simply easy,

47:26.250 --> 47:28.116
disillusioned, bored, indifferent,

47:28.750 --> 47:31.788
angelic or modest, unhappy,

47:31.958 --> 47:33.619
a debauched virginity,

47:33.792 --> 47:36.124
brutal shyness, cynical shame,

47:36.292 --> 47:39.080
cold heat, sober drunkenness
or nothing!

47:39.250 --> 47:41.207
The dirt, the perversity, the horror!

47:42.250 --> 47:44.412
Unfathomable. Darkness.

47:44.583 --> 47:47.450
She fears or she loves, or nothing.

47:47.625 --> 47:51.118
Vile, sensual, sly, shy, deep,

47:51.292 --> 47:54.614
coward, saint, sensitive, pure,

47:54.792 --> 47:58.365
faithful, innocent, cheeky,
maybe coquettish.

47:58.542 --> 48:02.206
Or simply easy, disillusioned, bored,

48:02.375 --> 48:04.992
indifferent, passionate or mean,

48:05.167 --> 48:07.750
angelic or modest, unhappy,

48:07.917 --> 48:11.114
a debauched virginity,
a brutal timidity.

48:11.875 --> 48:14.116
The blackness of their hearts.

48:16.083 --> 48:18.074
She was naked before him.

48:20.125 --> 48:22.742
I'll never know anything about her.

48:25.625 --> 48:29.163
I'll ask the husband
if his rooster was nude too.

48:47.042 --> 48:48.578
Sir!

48:49.083 --> 48:52.121
A terrible thing, sir!
Somebody killed Lena's cat!

48:52.667 --> 48:53.907
- Charlie?
- Yes, Charlie...

48:54.083 --> 48:58.156
He usually slept with me but that night,
I got home after "Star Wars".

48:58.333 --> 48:59.573
Only this morning...

49:07.750 --> 49:09.286
What a shock for you...

49:12.042 --> 49:14.124
I never thought anyone...

49:14.792 --> 49:16.499
No one, anyone...

49:29.542 --> 49:30.828
What do you think?

49:31.250 --> 49:34.242
- No idea?
- Where's the idea in hanging a cat!

49:36.375 --> 49:38.241
And you, dear, dear,

49:38.417 --> 49:41.000
wouldn't you know?
Who, where, how?

49:41.167 --> 49:42.953
How? With this string.

49:43.125 --> 49:45.992
- For me, regarding...
- You regard nothing.

49:46.417 --> 49:49.079
Who did this to you, poor darling?

49:49.250 --> 49:52.163
We know something is going on here...

49:52.625 --> 49:54.491
We've even started an investigation.

49:54.792 --> 49:57.284
I found it! I found it in my room!

49:57.875 --> 50:01.163
We were thinking
of checking Catherette's room.

50:01.333 --> 50:03.415
- Checking what?
- Everything.

50:03.583 --> 50:04.948
What's in that box?

50:05.375 --> 50:06.365
A frog!

50:06.792 --> 50:09.864
Sparrows, chickens, frogs and cats...

50:10.042 --> 50:12.409
Who could...
what kind of a person would...

50:12.583 --> 50:15.041
No. The hangings started
before we arrived.

50:15.208 --> 50:18.371
The sparrow was a bad sign.
And the pieces of wood...

50:18.542 --> 50:19.703
What pieces of wood?

50:19.875 --> 50:22.242
Put your glasses on, you old fool!

50:22.917 --> 50:24.954
- Fool? Me?
- Someone...

50:25.125 --> 50:27.412
Can't see anything,
there's the wall!

50:27.792 --> 50:29.749
If you'd just stop...

50:30.458 --> 50:32.995
Someone who plants toothpicks...

50:33.167 --> 50:37.411
and sprinkles salt on his wart
could very well hang a cat.

50:37.583 --> 50:40.075
Okay, let's leave things as they are.

50:40.750 --> 50:43.037
I'd like us to meet in the dining room.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.870
Witold and I want to share a few things.

50:47.250 --> 50:48.740
No more of this.

51:06.167 --> 51:08.784
That's how great detectives do it.

51:08.958 --> 51:11.791
How she has blossomed
since last night...

51:12.875 --> 51:15.867
a pen planted in lemon peel

51:16.292 --> 51:18.533
and a file planted in a plastic box.

51:18.708 --> 51:19.948
Needles,

51:20.125 --> 51:23.993
pens, lemon peel... safety pins.

51:24.167 --> 51:25.282
Fuck all, yes.

51:25.458 --> 51:26.914
Fuckallisimus!

51:27.083 --> 51:30.872
So all this shitimus
found by these gentlemen in your room?

51:31.042 --> 51:32.373
Keep yer snout out!

51:32.542 --> 51:35.034
- Where are you going?
- To bury Charlie.

51:35.208 --> 51:37.950
Catherette has her moods...

51:38.458 --> 51:39.869
Leon. It can only be Leon!

51:42.417 --> 51:44.749
Mind you, Madame,
you too were swinging...

51:44.917 --> 51:46.078
- I was swinging?
- Yes.

51:46.250 --> 51:47.832
An axe. At the chopping block.

51:48.000 --> 51:48.910
<i>J</i> ill'???

51:49.083 --> 51:50.369
- So what?
- So what!

51:50.542 --> 51:53.159
You were swinging with a vengeance!

51:53.333 --> 51:55.415
I wasn't swinging, I was banging.

51:55.583 --> 51:59.406
Lena, my sweet,
explain why I was thumping.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.039
Mum, from time to time...

52:01.333 --> 52:03.040
It's like a crisis now and again.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.415
So she grabs anything
just to let off steam.

52:05.583 --> 52:07.824
She smashes. She breaks glass.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.911
I grab anything. Anything!

52:10.542 --> 52:11.828
Yes, anything.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.332
Not anything! Anything!

52:14.958 --> 52:18.155
- We should go to the police.
- I wouldn't recommend it.

52:18.333 --> 52:21.405
Those bastards are most unpleasant!

52:21.583 --> 52:22.493
And then...

52:22.875 --> 52:25.333
there was more knocking.

52:25.667 --> 52:26.657
From upstairs...

52:27.583 --> 52:28.789
It was me.

52:29.625 --> 52:33.414
When it takes hold of me,
she grabs me by the arm

52:33.583 --> 52:36.245
and then she makes a ruckus.

52:36.792 --> 52:39.124
For me to come back to myself.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.573
I heard two sets of noises.
I know, I was on the stairs. I heard!

52:44.958 --> 52:46.244
Two sets?

52:46.417 --> 52:49.739
Yes, I banged again
against the shutters.

52:49.917 --> 52:53.410
I was nervous, I wasn't sure
that mum had calmed down.

52:54.083 --> 52:57.041
With Lucien's shoe,
while he was taking a shower.

53:01.542 --> 53:04.534
We should go help Catherette
with the cat.

53:04.708 --> 53:06.540
But, as I'm allergic, wouldn't you...

53:06.708 --> 53:08.540
So you could say good riddance!

53:08.708 --> 53:09.948
All this savagery...

53:10.125 --> 53:11.866
Will you just shut up!

53:13.250 --> 53:14.786
I'll shut up, fine,

53:14.958 --> 53:18.496
but thinking... that, never I will stop!

53:23.667 --> 53:25.783
She's lying. She's lying!

53:25.958 --> 53:27.073
Come.

53:28.125 --> 53:31.288
- Why do you say she's lying?
- I was the one banging at the door!

53:31.458 --> 53:33.665
- What for?
- To penetrate.

53:35.958 --> 53:38.245
And then I hanged the cat!

53:38.417 --> 53:41.159
- What did it do to you?
- It was her cat.

53:41.458 --> 53:43.916
A triangle with the sparrow and wood.

53:44.083 --> 53:45.414
Stop it!

53:50.958 --> 53:54.451
There's something
soft but assassin like about cats.

53:54.625 --> 53:56.457
They're atrocious!

53:57.208 --> 53:58.824
Those electric crackles...

53:59.000 --> 54:02.573
The cat is good for caressing,
but also for torturing.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.990
Listen to me!

54:04.375 --> 54:06.833
The teapot was the last straw.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.115
What are you saying?

54:08.292 --> 54:11.910
I killed the cat,
but her feet stay so little.

54:12.333 --> 54:15.576
- How does this affect you?
- I've seen a lot of things.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.913
She found herself small
in front of the cat

54:19.083 --> 54:21.415
and was ashamed of the cat.

54:21.583 --> 54:23.039
My friend, you look totally...

54:23.208 --> 54:24.949
- I'll ask forgiveness.
- To Lena?

54:25.125 --> 54:26.081
To the cat.

54:26.250 --> 54:29.663
Too small for everything,
she's only good for love, nothing more.

54:29.833 --> 54:32.700
You're getting deep.
Like Sartre or Stendhal...

54:32.875 --> 54:35.663
Anything relating to her
can only be loving.

54:35.833 --> 54:38.165
That happens
when a writer hangs a cat?

54:38.333 --> 54:40.415
And even if she can't guess who did it,

54:40.583 --> 54:44.247
she'll still be ashamed of the cat
which is her cat. Our cat.

54:44.958 --> 54:47.040
That wasn't the real murder.

54:47.208 --> 54:50.326
How could this beauty, so perfect
and out of reach,

54:50.500 --> 54:52.912
unite with me through lying?

54:53.583 --> 54:54.948
Yes, wait.

54:56.625 --> 54:58.832
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

55:02.167 --> 55:06.081
This is to tell you, to tempt you...

55:06.917 --> 55:09.705
My sweet lovely dumpling,

55:10.083 --> 55:12.575
thanks to whom we are all here,

55:13.750 --> 55:16.287
had a happy idea,
like all her ideas...

55:16.458 --> 55:20.622
We should get some fresh air

55:20.792 --> 55:25.707
to get away for a bit, from this house,
its aberrations, if you want to or not

55:25.875 --> 55:28.082
no more guarantees of tranquillity.

55:29.042 --> 55:31.704
<i>The aberration, fiat ub/ vu/t',</i>

55:31.875 --> 55:35.197
can happen again-um.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.743
Swinery-tum, in-swine-tum.

55:39.917 --> 55:42.409
Tiriri!

55:44.583 --> 55:47.905
So, my dumpling had the idea
of going on a day trip

55:48.083 --> 55:50.996
finishing at the seaside.

55:51.167 --> 55:52.407
Oh my God!

55:53.625 --> 55:55.536
Lena reminded us

55:56.667 --> 56:00.410
of their house, which is nearly finished
and quite habitable.

56:00.583 --> 56:04.076
Lena even gave the key
to her best friend

56:04.250 --> 56:06.742
who is in the middle of her honeymoon.

56:07.292 --> 56:11.536
It's true that in time,
she'll be up to her neck in the sea.

56:13.333 --> 56:18.499
Therefore, dumplingette thought
of first making a little pilgrimage

56:19.208 --> 56:21.620
to fight

56:23.917 --> 56:25.373
the curse.

56:30.167 --> 56:32.909
Just now they're preparing the grub,

56:34.042 --> 56:35.498
some sandwiches...

56:35.667 --> 56:37.874
a seaside picnic.

56:38.292 --> 56:41.489
And dumplingette, the telephonette

56:41.667 --> 56:44.659
already called Lena's friend...

56:47.750 --> 56:50.367
And here I am

56:51.583 --> 56:53.540
in my very home

56:54.208 --> 56:57.655
like an old stray dog,
and I cannot trust anybody

56:57.833 --> 56:59.870
because who can guarantee

57:01.292 --> 57:03.875
that it will stop with the cat?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.582
After the cat,

57:09.875 --> 57:13.664
will it not turn into a bigger game?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.661
And above all,

57:19.542 --> 57:21.078
take your car

57:21.250 --> 57:25.244
in case anyone wants to regain freedom.
Like you, from Grenoble.

57:25.417 --> 57:26.748
No, from Paris.

57:27.500 --> 57:28.911
Even worse.

57:29.083 --> 57:31.120
The gloom.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.992
Post cards to poo-poo, pee-pee-tum.

57:35.167 --> 57:38.239
The sinister guano tourism.

57:38.792 --> 57:41.204
I will show you

57:41.375 --> 57:44.242
little first class landscapes, prima,

57:44.417 --> 57:46.533
wonders of wonder-ums,

57:46.708 --> 57:48.494
wonderingity-unicus

57:48.667 --> 57:50.954
<i>but enchanfmgness-um um</i>

57:51.375 --> 57:52.957
for an entire

57:53.917 --> 57:55.282
lifetime.

57:59.542 --> 58:00.703
Leon!

58:02.208 --> 58:05.280
He is always blah-blahing-um,
joking-um.

58:05.458 --> 58:09.702
And dumplingette-the-cateringette!

58:11.458 --> 58:12.869
This I found

58:13.750 --> 58:15.161
seventeen years ago.

58:15.333 --> 58:17.870
He lugs it around everywhere,
the old fool!

58:18.458 --> 58:20.699
The phenomenality

58:21.833 --> 58:23.323
of grass blades,

58:24.917 --> 58:26.499
of smallest flowers,

58:27.750 --> 58:31.368
a sort of streaming

58:31.542 --> 58:34.534
in purest poetry.

58:35.125 --> 58:36.741
Tiriri...

58:37.458 --> 58:40.530
Licking-um the jowlies

58:41.125 --> 58:43.082
of my dumplingette.

58:43.875 --> 58:46.367
If Lena goes, I go. Full stop.

58:46.542 --> 58:48.328
Sparrows, cats,

58:48.500 --> 58:51.913
pieces of wood, chicken, cops...
and now excursions.

59:18.042 --> 59:20.204
Have you noticed
that Lena's put lipstick on?

59:20.375 --> 59:21.365
I haven't.

59:21.542 --> 59:23.203
Mr Lucien chastised her.

59:23.375 --> 59:26.447
He thinks it's like
smearing her mouth with blood.

59:30.208 --> 59:32.119
Vice and Virtue.

59:41.458 --> 59:42.698
Please explain.

59:42.875 --> 59:44.411
My trousers, clean.

59:44.792 --> 59:48.410
Variations, romances,
sometimes soft, sometimes brutal.

59:48.958 --> 59:51.120
And nothing can be explained,
at least properly.

59:51.292 --> 59:53.158
He to himself for his own.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.365
My little moon beam!

59:58.333 --> 01:00:01.621
You've regained your randiness!
You did!

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.783
It's like going on honeymoon!

01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:08.201
This car's a bone shaker.
A whole trip, in this trap.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:09.285
And Leon!

01:00:09.458 --> 01:00:11.950
- He'll never squeeze inside.
- Yes he will.

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:14.033
Your stick, Leon!

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:16.495
- Do you mind?
- Of course, please.

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:20.365
Dumpling and I have one,
but it's a hybrid.

01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:22.624
These days, my dear, my dear,

01:00:23.042 --> 01:00:25.750
there are too many hybrids for comfort.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.499
- Pity we won't go around.
- Why?

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:33.624
We'd see if Catherette is levitating.

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:36.124
Don't tell me you Pasolinied her.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.867
Oh, the peaks! The perspective.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.532
The beyond!

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.740
Careful!

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.240
A hawk?

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:29.375
- A non-sparrow anyway.
- A whore hawk.

01:01:29.542 --> 01:01:31.704
Hard to hang, this one.

01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:05.749
Feeling better, my little doll?

01:02:05.917 --> 01:02:07.248
- Faith!
- Yes.

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:11.285
Fifteen minutes of infinity,
blackjack in a life where nothing's free.

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:15.580
God almighty, merciful God...

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:22.038
The devil take me if I forget this one.

01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:24.540
Your flights of fancy, Leon.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.116
What a charming excursion.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.491
Father, did you hitchhike?

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.369
- Where to?
- A sandwich?

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:34.250
- Same as us. To the sea.
- An excursion.

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:37.120
These are not good walking shoes.

01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:44.534
Does it not inconvenience you
to take the priest in your car?

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:46.870
- Not at all.
- Oh come.

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:54.078
Aren't you waiting for me?

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.081
<i>Ya de Iajoie!</i>

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:07.033
- Something begins to form.
- What?

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:10.200
The embryo of the whole.
Just like "Nausea".

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:14.118
The bird, too high,
the red mouth, rustic fingers, too low.

01:03:14.292 --> 01:03:16.704
He had to meddle with something.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:18.457
Something that disquiets him.

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:20.662
- What, do you think?
- Some sin?

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:24.872
This priest, a colleague, sin,
conscience, crime, remorse surfaces...

01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:28.535
He bothers, he's too much...
Almost like the teapot.

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:32.622
All these things which stay behind,
are becoming more and more present...

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.829
Everything is hybrid,
as Leon says.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.582
- What would you do to her?
- To whom?

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.206
Lena, who else?

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:40.616
- Aside from bang her...
- Hang her.

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:42.032
You fuckwit!

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:46.325
I dunno, kiss her, adore her,
caress her.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.037
Torture her.
Humiliate her, just to see.

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:51.870
If she puts on lipstick
after her cat's death,

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:54.158
Then push a finger into her mouth!

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.825
And Leon, always the gentleman!

01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:25.198
It's Tolo.

01:04:25.417 --> 01:04:26.999
Ginette. Witold.

01:04:36.083 --> 01:04:38.290
Tolo is the gym teacher in our school.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.199
He was a brave in Afghanistan.

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:42.958
He resigned when they pulled out,
then he met me.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.913
It's been two weeks
since they can legally do it.

01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:03.700
So bink, bonk, bang, biology!

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:12.244
Will you join us, Father?

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.121
- I have something heavy to tell you.
- Heavy?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.831
I'm in love.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.583
That Ginette, isn't her body boring?

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.866
- Mono-toned?
- Sparrow-toned!

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:29.532
Boflng?

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.615
So, welcome.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.958
There's the kitchen,
the toilet is on the right.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:37.911
The rooms are upstairs.

01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:41.874
Take any you want,
Lena and I will choose last.

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.620
Okay?
Don't keep the wine.

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:48.204
- How many are we for lunch?
- Nine.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:59.665
Mono-toned and boring.

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:04.206
Chasms, knots, strata,
patterns, rhythms,

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:07.208
wounds, sores, scree...

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:12.906
Did you see those delicately
joined limbs, like a ballerina's...

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:16.291
- Careful.
- Shit, you're a real coconut.

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:18.620
Limbs, delicately joined...

01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:22.706
The irresistible and menacing
tide of things.

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:25.623
The irresistible

01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:28.074
and menacing tide of things.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.287
Lena, clean or dirty...

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:37.289
I love her.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.039
I love her.

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:43.746
Oh, there you are Father,
dinner's served!

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:53.407
Tiriri.

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:56.166
Cooks it, it's gone.
Over. No more.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:58.791
As soon as the sun goes down...

01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:00.414
In vino-um veritas!

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:04.036
And the mutton?
Tolo's doing as well?

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.074
Tolo's, it's always Tolo's...

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.119
These are not

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:13.614
those first class landscape-urns,
but have patience.

01:07:15.958 --> 01:07:17.824
Everything is too much!

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.664
What a joy,
on top of that, weather to die for!

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.540
Yes, Colonel! To die, says I!

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:25.039
To die.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.912
Not to die, to die!

01:07:32.625 --> 01:07:33.786
Some wine?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.706
Remind you of someone?

01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:40.747
Of course. Catherette's spitting image,
well, except for...

01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:45.458
Almost everything where one needs it.

01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:47.203
But then...

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.990
a bodily solitude...

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.583
Oh, I've got my eyes on you, scoundrel.

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:13.874
Such bliss! No TV!

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.240
It's like at a station,

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.536
waiting for a train to depart...

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.908
- Would you like some wine?
- A drop.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.116
<i>Blood down the drain!</i>

01:08:31.167 --> 01:08:34.613
Would you believe
that seventeen years ago,

01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:36.999
my Leon was quite fit?

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:39.491
Dodging and contrast.

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:03.992
- Care for anything else, Father?
- Camembert.

01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:07.613
Oh, Camembert, here it is!
With salad.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:11.200
Delicious, the salad!

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:15.247
You were so much more delicious!
My callipygian Venus.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:17.415
Prehistoric...

01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:18.913
We shouldn't complain.

01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:21.620
- Except about the Spielberg movies...
- Terribly off...

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:22.907
It doesn't have...

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:24.413
The ineffable.

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:25.243
More wine...

01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:27.078
We love your trousers, Mr Tolo.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.411
We're such fans of Tintin!

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.875
- We hated him in jeans.
- Lack of class, Ginny.

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:35.578
Oh you and class...

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:39.408
I'll talk to Ralph and Lang,
might inspire them.

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:41.118
Castafiore's aria, what is it?

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:44.488
<i>I'm ecstatic to see myself
so lovely in the mirror!</i>

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:47.203
The Brussels restaurant, where the...

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:48.536
"Klov"!

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:54.576
She stinks more and more...
Or maybe its the priest...

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.866
A sort of physical self-centredness?

01:09:57.417 --> 01:09:59.328
The smell is barely bearable.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.036
Makes you puke, right?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.162
When she gets a whiff of herself!

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:09.539
I could take three baths a day,
with a few drops of lemon.

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:11.582
Jokes and japes.

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:16.910
The pet/ts <i>fours</i> melt in the mouth!

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:27.415
Don't I have the right?

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.658
Yes, I have the right...

01:10:33.958 --> 01:10:36.541
I know he's handsome, and I'm not.

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:42.244
To human meanness, don't I have the right
to oppose the purity of my love?

01:10:43.208 --> 01:10:46.246
You cannot forbid it,
nothing can replace love!

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:48.578
And I'm not ashamed.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.620
I need my siesta!
I have a right to it.

01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:05.914
You coming, Tolo?

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.494
Yes, my love.

01:11:08.625 --> 01:11:10.662
- Your fly.
- Yes, my precious...

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:15.327
When her father dies, an industrialist
she'll inherent a packet!

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.822
A siesta. Yes I am.
And a shower. To be clean.

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:20.698
Clean me, Lucien?

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:22.622
But now...

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:24.908
Already he loaned them his car...

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.124
- What kind?
- A black one.

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:34.456
- It's a Merde-cedes.
- Mercedes cars are shitty.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.040
Mrs Woytis had to come down a bit
from her pedestal-um

01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:44.744
when she married me.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.412
Leave me alone!

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.870
If the priest vomits, she shouldn't,

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:16.955
her mouth reinforcing
the ecclesiastic mouth.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:19.958
But if priesty pukes, why shouldn't she?

01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:23.534
How long will it hide and encircle?

01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:26.449
- Bleurgh.
- Bleurgh what?

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:27.990
Spielbleurgh.

01:12:28.417 --> 01:12:29.407
What else?

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:32.166
Bleurgman the filmmaker,
Strindbleurgh,

01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:34.745
Bleurghson, the philosopher of boredom.

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:37.874
What do these mouths have against me?

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:40.955
Well, you're less dumb than the others.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.456
So many emotions...

01:13:02.917 --> 01:13:05.409
- I'm done. And you?
- Drunk.

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:09.247
Oh, but what drunkness? What promises?

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:13.369
<i>I 'amour...</i>

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:17.790
Oh, what a great idea coming here!

01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:21.246
Exactly like facing mountain,
facing the sparrow,

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:24.159
the ceiling, the axe, the waste

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:27.200
like in Catherette's room... the cat.

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:29.908
Nothing. Listen to the silence!

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.989
The Rule of the priest,
weddings, his fat fingers.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.408
- Oh, that's viscous...
- Oblique.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:39.329
I suffer thinking of caressing her nape.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.706
Whose?

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:43.947
Ginette's, asshole... Not the priest's!

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:46.658
Oh, the lips of Catherette!

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:48.699
You never stop astounding me.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:51.492
To write, isn't it to astound?

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:56.867
Or the generosity whispers to a woman
that her hand can constitute a gift.

01:13:57.042 --> 01:13:59.830
Their torture. Her torture.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.958
How can I listen to silence
if you blah blah?

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:05.583
"The right...

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.116
to love."

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:25.245
Staring at the view or at my toes?

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:28.034
At your... Your lipstick's faded.

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:29.744
Indeed.

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:33.407
- Your neck...
- What?

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:34.994
If I broke your cat's neck

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.291
I would have to break your neck too

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:40.324
and hang you.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.208
Well, only just for me...

01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:46.908
God, are you naive.

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:50.243
But why me?

01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:53.250
Because there is an imperfection
in each perfection.

01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:55.579
A wrong in each righteousness.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.661
A mouth flawed in a mouth.

01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:59.449
A mouth just like mine.

01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:03.833
"When will this inner night disappear

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.617
"The universe - And I - my soul -

01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:09.204
"When shall my day come ?

01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:11.616
"When will I wake up from being awake?

01:15:11.792 --> 01:15:13.203
"I don't know

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.329
"The sun shines on high noon

01:15:16.833 --> 01:15:18.995
"And impossible to stare at

01:15:19.167 --> 01:15:22.000
"The heart beats far from itself

01:15:22.167 --> 01:15:24.124
"And impossible to hear

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:26.454
"When will this drama without theatre

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:28.957
- Or this theatre without drama -
disappear?"

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:32.117
- You know this one?
- It's better in the original.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.868
"Who's the one who lives inside you?
O cat staring at me with eyes of life

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:39.409
"The same one even if totally different.

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:40.618
"It's him!

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.115
It's him!"

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.825
When will this drama
without a teapot disappear?

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:52.245
You forgot that I'm a language teacher.

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.454
- How many do you know?
- Some.

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:57.658
- Lena!
- Coming!

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.412
I only know one, barely...

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:09.744
I'm sick.

01:16:10.917 --> 01:16:12.578
I'm very sick...

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:16.040
I'm not so sick after all.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:21.745
But what are you doing here, Leon?

01:16:23.167 --> 01:16:25.408
Nothing! I do nothing!

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.949
I'm doing what one does all one's life:

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.707
nothing!

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:33.830
The chap-um stands up,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.207
sits down, jabbers, writes,

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:37.911
and nothing.

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:40.665
The chap-um insures,

01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:43.370
sells, gets married,
doesn't get married,

01:16:43.542 --> 01:16:44.998
and nothing!

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.164
The chap-um marches-um in sand-um

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.949
and nothing.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:52.786
Bubbly water.

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:54.244
A whale.

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:56.408
And for what?

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:57.914
Nothing!

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:00.660
I've had enough!

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.865
Thievery!

01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:05.454
You look upset. Is it still the cat?

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:08.413
The cat-um is but a detail...

01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:13.323
On the other hand, you

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.537
my old boozing partner.

01:17:16.167 --> 01:17:19.785
Look at me!
Bring your nose-um closer!

01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:21.539
To sniff you?

01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:25.409
I've put on some cologne!

01:17:25.833 --> 01:17:27.164
Tiriri!

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.749
- You coming with me?
- Where?

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:33.541
- The other way.
- I'll grab my umbrella.

01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.119
Look!

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:38.450
Look at this immense water

01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:41.697
salty like tears!

01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:43.206
But...

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.082
But here, too: nothing.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.615
And you?

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:51.165
Apart from that...

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:56.833
yes, there are some nerves
in my tension,

01:17:57.583 --> 01:18:00.951
and some tension in my nerves!

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:05.909
- Where you going?
- Wherever I'll blow the wind!

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:08.370
As a pilgrim with my stick

01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:09.994
to Mass I go!

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:12.784
Where I'll be my own priest,
my little man,

01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:14.289
my stinking PQpe!

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:16.540
<i>I sing, evenings and morning</i>

01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:18.119
<i>I sing!</i>

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:23.414
The cadaver-um of the scrounging cat
could grate my nerves.

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:26.200
You are probably thinking about

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:29.037
my little muzzle-games on the cloth-um

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:32.280
Toothpickums and salt,
under the gaze of my wife.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.199
Except that she doesn't get it.

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:36.286
- Get what?
- That bleurgh.

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:39.075
Any bleurghing of dodging and contrast.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:40.661
Look at that!

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.578
This bumblebee.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:45.492
Like a helicopter, the rascal.

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:49.999
Whenever I want.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:54.491
Because, dear, my youth was so-so.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.958
Me just a bit, but not really...

01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:01.948
Like behind glass, one watches the other
from morning to night.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:05.197
And I invented for myself,
a tiny pleasure at the office.

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:09.915
With my nail, I deepened a groove
in the wooden table.

01:19:10.708 --> 01:19:12.995
And once in Neuilly,

01:19:13.167 --> 01:19:17.832
when I was insuring an actress,
a lioness, believe me,

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:21.530
handing over papers,
I touched her hand.

01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:24.700
The mad excitement of this tiny touch

01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:26.411
but no way...

01:19:26.583 --> 01:19:28.915
So I wised up:

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:33.957
why seek the hand of another
when we have two ourselves?

01:19:36.375 --> 01:19:39.117
With practice, one can become an expert.

01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:42.284
A hand touches another,
no one can see it.

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:47.203
And it's not even a felony,
but with a finger one can touch

01:19:47.792 --> 01:19:50.329
one's knee or the ear...

01:19:53.792 --> 01:19:56.705
- You're bleurghing too?
- I what?

01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.323
Proper, huh?

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.161
Tutti frutti!

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:10.911
Our other follies.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:12.914
In the void

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:15.286
the desert-um

01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:17.574
in the far far aways,

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:19.787
in the deadly calm

01:20:19.958 --> 01:20:22.040
of the mountains, the sea...

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:24.290
Leaving aside all what remains,

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:26.199
a left over, immense

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:27.740
and menacing...

01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:34.290
Do you really think I'm blind?

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:35.573
Say...

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.620
Secreto-desire-um and bleurgh.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:43.707
You Sir, would love to get into-bleurgh
the panties of my almost daughter

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:46.788
in full lover-um number one
in her tiriri marriage-um!

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:49.791
- You're a shit.
- Oh no. The priest is the shit.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:51.865
Besides,

01:20:52.292 --> 01:20:53.782
who knows?

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:55.744
With me, at least, you know,

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:59.865
a dumplingette, a grain of salt,
Catherette and bang!

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.750
If a corn can hurt the foot

01:21:02.917 --> 01:21:05.625
why could it not bring ecstasy?

01:21:05.792 --> 01:21:09.080
- You're a believer. I'd never guess.
- Believer...

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.788
Even the slightest of things
cannot be without belief...

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:14.790
For, primum:

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.120
the boar, the lion,

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:18.578
the mountain.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:20.414
Secundum:

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:23.826
the lice, the sparrow, the worm.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.198
Ergo, the huge and pathetic scale...

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:32.827
It is true that I fuck about often,
to facilitate.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.118
But if I wouldn't facilitate,
it would be too difficult.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:37.703
So it was you?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.824
Artillery discharges are as important
as the sound of bells...

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.707
<i>Are We All Murderers?</i>

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.663
A movie. Wondrous Marina Vlady!

01:21:49.833 --> 01:21:51.164
It wasn't Marina Vlady!

01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:52.823
- Lick!
- My finger?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.786
Lick a bit, say I!

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:56.540
Or go spit on yourself.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:59.166
Because you thought Leon,

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:02.997
the old fart, his life ridiculous,
subterranean,

01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:05.374
did he bring you here for nothing?

01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:07.579
- But it's for the anniversary.
- Whose?

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:11.163
Well, not exactly seventeen years
less one month and three days.

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:13.916
Mine. Water, sweet!

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:18.323
Sweet water!

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:19.789
Once,

01:22:19.958 --> 01:22:22.996
only once in all my life-tum.

01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:26.583
With the little slut
helping in the kitchen.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:28.748
Ireached.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:32.455
She was working in a small hotel
that has since burnt down.

01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:36.414
Luckily, Lucien settled down
not far from here.

01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:38.369
He's charming, Lucien, isn't he?

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:42.866
Lucien, who doesn't want
his wife being actress.

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.833
It was here, just once...

01:22:47.708 --> 01:22:49.164
I've known...

01:22:51.417 --> 01:22:53.954
the miracle, if you allow me...

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:57.825
between grace and malediction.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.573
Pveloved.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:27.624
There might be a chill in the air.

01:23:31.917 --> 01:23:33.328
Your husband?

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.661
Somewhere...

01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:44.914
Sorry.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.035
Sorry.

01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:54.703
Sorry.

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.749
Did you see him, Mr. Witol?

01:24:13.917 --> 01:24:15.157
Yes, in the forest.

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:16.994
- And?
- He wants us to join him.

01:24:17.167 --> 01:24:21.081
- What for?
- I don't know. Admire his landscape?

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:24.697
At night? Typical Leon.
One sees nothing at night.

01:24:26.542 --> 01:24:29.034
Mr Witol, as for walking,
I gave it my due.

01:24:30.083 --> 01:24:32.199
It's Witol-d.

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:46.124
Queen Maxima...

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:47.373
the King...

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:50.373
Hold that for me.

01:24:52.292 --> 01:24:55.034
The worst part is
that she is so inspired.

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:56.073
Lena?

01:24:56.250 --> 01:25:00.118
Of course not Lena, Ginny!
They never cut her any slack.

01:25:00.292 --> 01:25:01.532
The poor soul.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.957
Fuck, you don't look so good.

01:25:05.125 --> 01:25:07.082
It was him. Leon.

01:25:13.167 --> 01:25:14.657
- Except the cat.
- What?

01:25:14.833 --> 01:25:19.498
As long as you did not understand
that every thing is a huge army,

01:25:19.667 --> 01:25:22.375
everything, a crowd...

01:25:23.542 --> 01:25:26.739
It is as if we were not quite there,
me and her,

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:28.123
her and me,

01:25:28.292 --> 01:25:31.455
it's as if we had been projected
from elsewhere

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:32.831
from the moon.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.490
Hello Mickey!

01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:37.703
I'm still here for you.

01:25:37.875 --> 01:25:40.537
- Get dressed, we'll have some fun.
- Super! We could use some!

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:44.155
The events we went through,
are slipping through our fingers

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:46.620
like sweepings,
and all those blows...

01:25:46.792 --> 01:25:49.159
Too clean, her Lucien.
Isn't he a bit dumb?

01:25:49.333 --> 01:25:51.165
No, he's a swell guy.

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:54.075
He's got surgeon's hands,
not like mine.

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:56.742
Mind you, sticking these in wherever.

01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:59.625
How did a guy like that
get such a beauty?

01:25:59.792 --> 01:26:02.500
His story about that chicken,
also weird.

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:05.036
Couples forming by chance.

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:06.494
What is there to say?

01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:07.789
Carpe diem!

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:13.249
The weight of the here and now
has become like the bleurgh,

01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:14.578
decisive.

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:19.369
<i>The weight of the here and now
has become like the bleurgh, decisive.</i>

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.866
Aren't you over doing it, a bit?

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:26.041
There will be a full moon,
it can be romantic.

01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:26.913
Where are we going?

01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:32.373
Leon, the arrows, the piece of wood,
the axe, everything.

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:36.030
But what is curious, very curious,

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.832
is that it changes nothing.

01:26:52.042 --> 01:26:54.283
I'm drowning with Lena.

01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:04.827
I won't let you.
With your shitty-tum thriller.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:07.741
It won't be a thriller.

01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.036
A film.

01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:34.286
Bravo, Tolo!

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.746
You did well to cover up,
there might be mosquitoes.

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:44.617
The sea will smell wonderful
after the dew.

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:47.033
You're the one smelling wonderful.

01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:00.498
Careful!

01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:06.657
How are you doing?

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.665
It's Catherette who illuminates me.

01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:12.208
From where will the predator pounce?

01:28:12.375 --> 01:28:14.036
I wonder what's going on...

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:16.912
Soon it's me who'll be on my honeymoon!

01:28:20.958 --> 01:28:21.868
Anatole?

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:24.574
Would you carry me across the stream?

01:28:30.042 --> 01:28:32.534
Right, Tolo, why not you?

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:34.790
Anatole, please, carry her.

01:28:38.708 --> 01:28:40.449
<i>Let's gm!</i>

01:28:51.458 --> 01:28:53.995
I think I forgot to pack my razor.

01:28:54.292 --> 01:28:57.250
Would you mind lending me yours, later?

01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:18.244
It's time to drown the bug.

01:29:29.708 --> 01:29:31.449
Clouds, clouds...

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.456
the moon.

01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:35.323
It's grand.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:37.119
Then too,

01:29:37.917 --> 01:29:39.328
as I remember.

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:42.115
I remember-um.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.412
<i>Transfigured Night.</i>

01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:51.161
You are just a face.

01:30:51.958 --> 01:30:53.198
A mask.

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.244
An object, a thing.

01:30:57.917 --> 01:30:59.874
Behind it, there's nothing.

01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:02.573
The void.

01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:25.123
Say nothing.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:29.038
I know that without her,
my life loses its music,

01:32:29.542 --> 01:32:31.783
its freshness, its passion.

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:33.948
Without her, standing there,

01:32:34.125 --> 01:32:36.662
full of attractions
I no longer want to see.

01:32:37.708 --> 01:32:39.790
My life is turning rotten,

01:32:40.333 --> 01:32:42.244
perverted, flat.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.448
Her smile...

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:48.664
her mouth...

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.990
<i>her hands.</i>

01:32:55.333 --> 01:32:58.075
It was I who became disgusting, not her.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.911
I am the maker of disgust.

01:33:01.958 --> 01:33:03.369
It's my fault.

01:33:28.417 --> 01:33:30.658
Who will believe me,
who would have thought?

01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:36.580
It's different doing it to a corpse
than to somebody alive.

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:38.366
You're hurting me.

01:33:38.542 --> 01:33:39.577
Sorry.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.742
Maybe he hanged himself
because you slept with a tenant?

01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:56.157
Leon? Catherette?

01:33:56.333 --> 01:34:00.497
Or was it a mania for hanging
that drove him to hang himself...

01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:02.499
There are no impossible combinations.

01:34:02.667 --> 01:34:05.534
Catherette's mouth, your mouth,
the sparrow, wood, cat.

01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:07.073
Lucien hangs... To hang!

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:10.413
Hangings turn upon me,
I've fused them with two mouths.

01:34:10.583 --> 01:34:12.039
I could not hang you.

01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:15.121
But that would be a disappointment.

01:34:15.292 --> 01:34:17.875
We're in love with each other...

01:34:18.042 --> 01:34:21.205
And if I want to do you in,
it's because you...

01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:11.447
Because one cannot fathom
what another has in his teapot.

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:13.957
Me, an exemplary spouse,

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:17.117
holding this egg,
toying with it between my fingers.

01:35:17.292 --> 01:35:20.739
Yes, but how to turn it?
Innocently, virtuously...

01:35:20.917 --> 01:35:22.624
But if I want to, I can also...

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:26.907
Tolo!

01:35:27.083 --> 01:35:29.495
He's not organising, Leon-um.

01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:31.539
He thinks.

01:35:32.958 --> 01:35:34.540
Lenin said:

01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:37.951
"Thinking has a colossal future."

01:35:41.583 --> 01:35:44.496
You never told me
why the towel moved by itself.

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.036
In "The Dumpted".

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.539
I wouldn't know.

01:35:48.917 --> 01:35:52.364
There's a reason
I have Gombrowicz's first name.

01:35:52.542 --> 01:35:55.910
He never knew how to finish his novels,
nor their meaning.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:58.124
I can't get you any closer...

01:35:58.292 --> 01:36:00.374
And your father
wouldn't be so hot about it.

01:36:00.542 --> 01:36:01.577
No...

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:13.369
Do you have faith?

01:36:15.292 --> 01:36:16.498
No...

01:36:23.292 --> 01:36:25.249
I can't get you any closer...

01:36:25.417 --> 01:36:28.250
And your father
wouldn't be so hot about it.

01:36:28.417 --> 01:36:29.452
No.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.831
Do you have faith?

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:37.032
No...

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.958
I still have to introduce her
to my parents.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.582
You'll see Catherette?

01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:49.956
For sure.

01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:51.661
He to himself for his own.

01:36:52.708 --> 01:36:54.619
He to himself for his own.

01:36:55.125 --> 01:36:56.957
Yes, we kept an eye on each other.

01:36:57.125 --> 01:37:01.369
But Catherette could have come
and lurked in the shadows.

01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:03.415
And that could have been
the murder.

01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:07.415
Ralph and Lang, of course...

01:37:20.417 --> 01:37:21.623
It's here.

01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:58.831
Lena!

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:04.038
You will become a great writer.

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:08.413
Will you help me
to become a real actress?

01:38:13.958 --> 01:38:15.915
A real actress?

01:38:16.917 --> 01:38:18.328
My mother wouldn't approve.

01:38:49.792 --> 01:38:53.786
<i>"Today we had chicken fricassee
with béchamel sauce for dinner."</i>

01:39:55.125 --> 01:39:57.617
Perfect, if not for the bunch of people

01:39:57.792 --> 01:39:59.328
in the frame.

01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:48.873
What are you
fucking doing?

01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:52.994
Leave her alone.

01:40:54.083 --> 01:40:55.539
<i>Malady of love</i>

01:40:55.708 --> 01:40:57.665
<i>Malady of youth...</i>

01:41:21.625 --> 01:41:23.491
Monsieur Leon,
what's happening to you?

01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:24.828
Nothing.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.207
There's nothing more
to see.

01:41:49.667 --> 01:41:52.079
