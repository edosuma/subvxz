make it back to Fairbanks today.</i>

Inside...</i>

<i>Slow and steady wins the race.</i>

barely stirring.</i>

about 40 miles an hour.</i>

<i>Narrator: The road is covered
in frost heaves, which are</i>

05:01.646 --> 05:03.513
<i>caused by freezing
water beneath</i>

05:03.515 --> 05:10.186
<i>the surface, and they blanket the
road like speed bumps made of ice.</i>

05:10.188 --> 05:13.556
<i>Get off my ass, Porkchop.</i>

05:13.558 --> 05:16.259
<i>It is too rough for
me to go any faster.</i>

05:16.261 --> 05:20.430
<i>Narrator: - But Porkchop...
- I have no idea what we're doing.</i>

05:20.497 --> 05:23.600
<i>Narrator: Isn't slowing down.</i>

05:23.602 --> 05:26.903
<i>Don't wanna see you
that close, Porkchop.</i>

<i>Narrator: And he's riding
dangerously close to Darrell's</i>

<i>Here's the deal-- He's up here</i>

<i>to do his job, I'm
here to do my job.</i>

<i>You know, I can't tell him
enough times to get off my ass.</i>

05:45.357 --> 05:47.156
<i>Come on, Porkchop, back off.</i>

05:47.158 --> 05:50.893
<i>You're cramping my style, yo.</i>

<i>Porkchop, back off.</i>

05:52.464 --> 05:53.563
<i>God!</i>

<i>I come out here to drive
this truck my way.</i>

05:56.001 --> 05:57.600
<i>And obviously my way is working</i>

05:57.602 --> 05:59.168
<i>pretty well, because we haven't</i>

<i>Shut the hell up.</i>

06:08.480 --> 06:10.713
<i>You can tell him, and he'll get
it for a second, but then</i>

06:10.715 --> 06:12.081
<i>it's all gone again.</i>

06:12.083 --> 06:14.384
<i>I need to put one
earplug in him.</i>

06:14.386 --> 06:18.921
<i>Plug one side, so
it'll stay in there.</i>

happened again...</i>

<i>As good as a truck may be, if it's
making you sick, it's not good.</i>

07:13.111 --> 07:16.579

<i>How are you doing this morning?</i>

09:49.767 --> 09:50.500
<i>Good, thanks.</i>

09:50.502 --> 09:51.934
<i>Do you have something
today for a change?</i>

09:52.035 --> 09:53.369
<i>- Uh, I do.
- Perfect.</i>

09:53.371 --> 09:56.105
<i>You're gonna take an
excavator to Aklavik.</i>

09:56.107 --> 10:00.009
<i>Uh, the road is only good for
30,000 and you're gonna be</i>

10:00.011 --> 10:04.947
<i>really close to 30
with that excavator.</i>

10:05.015 --> 10:05.748
<i>Very good.</i>

10:05.750 --> 10:09.852
<i>So once your loaded, make
sure you go to the scale.</i>

10:09.854 --> 10:12.121
<i>I will. Thank you. Very good.</i>

10:12.123 --> 10:12.855
<i>Have a safe ride.</i>

10:12.857 --> 10:15.124
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

10:15.126 --> 10:17.393
<i>[Dogs barking, howling]</i>

10:17.395 --> 10:21.030
<i>I got an excavator
to haul to Aklavik.</i>

10:21.032 --> 10:26.035
<i>That should make for
an interesting trip.</i>

10:26.037 --> 10:30.506
<i>Narrator: Today, Alex's load is headed
across the frozen Mackenzie River.</i>

10:30.508 --> 10:33.409
<i>Okay, I guess that's
that, though.</i>

10:33.411 --> 10:40.216
<i>Narrator: But before he hits the ice,
he'll have to hit the scales.</i>

10:40.218 --> 10:43.953
<i>My concern is that I'll be pretty
well at maximum weight for the ice.</i>

10:43.955 --> 10:48.925
<i>It's probably one of the heaviest
loads going to Aklavik this year.</i>

10:53.363 --> 10:57.667
<i>Tight on that side there.</i>

10:57.669 --> 11:01.337
<i>[Brakes squeaking]</i>

11:01.438 --> 11:04.507
<i>Load's too heavy.</i>

11:04.575 --> 11:07.343
<i>I'm about 15,000 pounds
overweight, which may be too</i>

11:07.345 --> 11:09.211
<i>heavy for this to
go down the road.</i>

11:09.213 --> 11:12.248
<i>Which means that we
won't be able to go.</i>

11:12.250 --> 11:15.051
<i>Narrator: Getting shut down at
the scales means missing out</i>

11:15.053 --> 11:19.322
<i>on the load and the paycheck
that goes with it.</i>

11:19.324 --> 11:23.059
<i>But the veteran's
not giving up.</i>

11:23.061 --> 11:25.595
<i>When a challenge presents itself,
a person has to look for</i>

11:25.597 --> 11:32.234
<i>another way to keep running.</i>

11:32.236 --> 11:34.103
<i>Narrator: - Coming up...
- There's always the</i>

11:34.105 --> 11:35.771
<i>possibility of going through.</i>

11:35.773 --> 11:37.907
<i>Narrator: Alex goes for it.</i>

11:37.909 --> 11:40.242
<i>- And later...
- Oh, God.</i>

11:40.244 --> 11:42.244
<i>Narrator: A deadly diagnosis.</i>

11:42.246 --> 11:44.778
<i>It's, like, a 2% survival rate.</i>

11:47.424 --> 11:52.828
Narrator: - In northern Canada...
- You're going to Aklavik.

11:52.830 --> 11:53.796
Yes.

11:53.798 --> 11:56.799
Narrator: Alex Debogorski has
just learned his load is over

11:56.801 --> 12:00.903
- the ice road weight limit...
- Don't worry about it.

12:00.905 --> 12:01.704
See you later.

12:01.706 --> 12:04.073
All right.

12:04.075 --> 12:06.909
Narrator: And officials are
issuing a special permit for the

12:06.911 --> 12:11.814
veteran to attempt the
crossing at his own risk.

12:11.816 --> 12:17.019
But a piece of paper isn't
gonna help him out on the ice.

12:17.021 --> 12:19.355
I'm on my way to Aklavik.

12:19.422 --> 12:24.560
This is the heaviest
load I've hauled on ice.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.932
Well, the roads are both open.

12:29.934 --> 12:35.371
The winter ice road
maximum weight-- 30,000.

12:35.373 --> 12:38.540
Ease her on in.

12:38.542 --> 12:42.177
Narrator: Alex crossed this water
at the start of the season.

12:42.179 --> 12:47.016
Holy smokes!

12:47.018 --> 12:51.921
Narrator: But this time his
load is over ten times heavier.

12:51.923 --> 12:55.991
Since our weight is over the limit,
we gotta be careful about

12:55.993 --> 12:58.794
coming on the ice,
coming off the ice.

12:58.796 --> 13:01.096
It's the number one danger.

13:11.441 --> 13:13.676
Because the load's this heavy, I
gotta stick to the center of

13:13.678 --> 13:17.913
the road and drive
with more caution.

13:24.487 --> 13:27.523
Narrator: Alex hammers down to
keep his load from sinking in

13:27.525 --> 13:30.025
the unpredictable river ice.

13:30.027 --> 13:33.028
Come on.

13:38.969 --> 13:44.506
There is always a possibility of
breaking the ice and going through...

13:44.508 --> 13:47.343
if I'm not careful enough.

13:51.614 --> 13:52.247

Warning. Spike brake is on.

13:56.454 --> 14:00.089
Warning. Spike brake is on.

14:00.091 --> 14:03.826
What do you mean, "a
spike brake is on"?

14:03.828 --> 14:06.528
A spike brake is a hand brake.

14:06.530 --> 14:08.364
And generally it's
for the trailer.

14:08.366 --> 14:10.532
If I apply the foot brake, the
brakes on the trailer and the

14:10.534 --> 14:11.467
truck come on.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.803
When I apply the spike, it's only
the trailer brakes that come on.

14:14.805 --> 14:16.805
Warning. Spike brake is on.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.913
Narrator: Malfunctioning
brakes are a serious problem.

14:24.915 --> 14:26.448
But stopping is even worse.

14:26.450 --> 14:30.619
[Water gurgling]

14:30.621 --> 14:34.790
Stopping on the ice increases a
driver's chance of breaking through.

14:34.792 --> 14:38.894
And with this overweight
excavator, Alex has 15,000

14:38.896 --> 14:42.731
extra reasons to keep moving.

14:42.733 --> 14:46.568

- I'm fueled and ready to rock.

15:01.919 --> 15:05.087
Narrator: Austin Wheeler
is just starting his day.

15:05.089 --> 15:05.120
Just starting his day.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.856
I'm gonna give you those
pickups out there that are on

15:07.858 --> 15:10.993
that 53-foot
flatbed-- Those F550s.

15:10.995 --> 15:11.827
No problem.

15:11.895 --> 15:16.365
However, I would like you to
move 'em steady, not fast.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.099
Okay.

15:17.101 --> 15:18.967
Since I've got drivers coming
down here and walking in

15:18.969 --> 15:22.905
and going, "hey, that kid Austin
is driving awful fast up there,"

15:22.907 --> 15:25.374
maybe you oughta slow
down just a little bit.

15:25.376 --> 15:26.675
Okay.

15:26.677 --> 15:30.112
Narrator: All season...
[Horn honks]

15:30.114 --> 15:32.848
Hammer down, boys.

15:32.850 --> 15:36.318
Narrator: Austin's been flying up
the Dalton every chance he gets.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.488
Just gonna be like a
rocket ship to Prudhoe.

15:39.490 --> 15:42.658
Narrator: But the haul road
rookie's eager attitude hasn't

15:42.660 --> 15:46.095
won him many friends.

15:46.097 --> 15:48.464
I don't get much
respect on the job.

15:48.466 --> 15:49.865
I'm not gonna get mad about it.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.133
I don't really care.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.836
I'm just gonna do a good job and
show them that I have what it

15:53.838 --> 15:57.773
takes and not make mistakes and
get the product and me up there

15:57.775 --> 16:02.778
safely and me back safely so
I can take another load up.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.513
Let's roll.

- Is there anything coming, so

16:12.923 --> 16:14.756
I can just blast around you?

16:14.858 --> 16:18.260
Uh, if you want
around, it's clear.

16:18.262 --> 16:22.297

is taking it slow.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.375
[Horn honks]

16:33.443 --> 16:35.911
All right, stretch it
out there, short stuff.

16:35.913 --> 16:39.581
This is bullshit.

16:39.649 --> 16:42.584
It kind of really chaps my butt
that he's gotta say something

16:42.586 --> 16:49.124
stupid over the radio
like that, but whatever.

17:07.511 --> 17:08.777
Go ahead.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.579
Don't be catching
an attitude now.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.946
I was just joking a little bit.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.515
What do you want me to say?

17:13.517 --> 17:14.782
So come on.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.484
We don't need that here.

17:16.487 --> 17:18.153
Whatever.

17:18.155 --> 17:19.320
Fine, I ain't bugging you.

17:19.323 --> 17:21.156
Don't be like that.

I'm just tired of
catching it, dude.

hard time, you know.

to make fun of me?

let's go, blah, blah."

17:52.890 --> 17:54.690
Whatever.

17:54.692 --> 17:59.261
My nice guy level
is running out.

17:59.263 --> 18:01.396
Or if there's a truck stuck on
the side of the road, I'll--

18:01.398 --> 18:05.267
Fuck it, I ain't even
stopping to help anymore.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.724
down, man.

Narrator: Darrell and Porkchop
roll south toward Fairbanks.

18:32.896 --> 18:33.528
I've backed off.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.229
Let him do his thing.

18:34.231 --> 18:35.764
I'll do my thing.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.866
Narrator: And free of the
frost heaves, Porkchop's

18:37.868 --> 18:40.502
finally keeping a safe distance.

18:40.504 --> 18:42.337
Got one coming at you, Chop.

18:42.339 --> 18:44.840
Porkchop, you got
one coming at you.

18:44.842 --> 18:50.679
Narrator: - But a few miles away...
- Darrell and Porkchop.

18:50.681 --> 18:54.149
I can hear them, uh, off in the
distance here not too far.

18:54.151 --> 18:54.182
Distance here not too far.

18:54.217 --> 18:58.553
So maybe we'll do a
little surprise visit.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.957
Narrator: Lane Keator is
filling in for Jack Jessee,

19:01.959 --> 19:09.464
convoying a load of explosives
with Carlile owner Harry McDonald.

19:09.466 --> 19:12.567
Hey, boys, how's it
going out there?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.436
Oh, hey, Lane, I didn't
know you were up here.

19:14.438 --> 19:15.637
What's happening?

19:15.639 --> 19:18.073
Ah, you know, the next truck
was just sitting in the yard.

19:18.075 --> 19:21.043
So, uh, it's not making any
money there, so we had to get

19:21.045 --> 19:23.478
out and exercise a little bit.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.749
- We're all getting off here and-- and--
- Come check on the boys, huh?

19:27.751 --> 19:29.651
We'll do whatever y'all want.

19:29.653 --> 19:32.487
Naw, just up here
at the top hill.

19:37.694 --> 19:39.127
Ready to go check on the boys?

19:39.129 --> 19:40.729
See what our new
guys are doing here.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.831
Yeah.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.500
Narrator: At the start of this
run, Lane asked Darrell to

19:45.502 --> 19:49.271
- keep an eye on Porkchop...
- Hey, Darrell.

19:49.273 --> 19:52.541
Narrator: Hoping some of the long
hauler's skill would rub off.

19:52.543 --> 19:54.776
I just wanted to get you off
to the side for a minute.

19:54.778 --> 19:55.711
Okay.

19:55.713 --> 19:57.346
I know we talked before you
left and putting you-- Grouping

19:57.348 --> 19:58.347
you with Porkchop.

19:58.349 --> 19:59.081
Right.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.716
You know, I'm good
with it, Lane.

20:00.718 --> 20:02.584
You know, I get a little
frustrated sometimes, just

20:02.586 --> 20:04.553
dragging my feet and
dragging my feet.

20:04.555 --> 20:05.287
Yeah.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.122
You know, I can run up north,
drop my load, make it back to

20:07.124 --> 20:07.889
Fairbanks the next day.

20:07.891 --> 20:09.558
I could do these
rounds in two days.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.692
I'm three days into this.

20:10.694 --> 20:11.360
Yeah.

20:11.362 --> 20:14.596
And I'm rolling out late on my
fourth day with my next round.

20:14.598 --> 20:16.832
Finish this trip up, keep working
with him, and then we'll

20:16.834 --> 20:19.334
talk again and see where
we need to go with this.

20:19.336 --> 20:21.002
Right, perfect.

20:21.004 --> 20:21.837
Have a good trip.

20:21.839 --> 20:22.637
All right.

20:22.639 --> 20:23.372
Thanks, Darrell.

20:25.743 --> 20:28.009
Sounds like if Porkchop doesn't
get his shit together and

20:28.011 --> 20:30.112
kinda get it figured out-- Like
Lane says, you know, we'll

20:30.114 --> 20:34.383
help him out for a while and if
it don't work, we'll cut ties.

20:34.385 --> 20:39.888
Sounds like I'm golden and
Porkchop's kinda riding the fence.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.758
Darrell's doing a
real good job for us.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.694
I'm real glad to have him aboard
and, uh, I look forward to a

20:45.696 --> 20:47.729
long future with him.

20:47.731 --> 20:50.999
Porkchop on the other hand is gonna
have to-- He's got some work to do.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.834
He's gotta get his head
in the right spot.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.704
He's gotta, you know, keep
learning the ways of the road

20:55.706 --> 21:05.380
and hopefully we can, uh, be successful
and make this whole thing work.

21:05.382 --> 21:07.916
Hey, it's like I said
when I began this trip.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.651
I'm doing it by the book.

21:09.653 --> 21:10.652
I ain't done nothing wrong.

21:10.654 --> 21:12.020
I ain't gotta worry about it.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.588
Am I in front? Nah.

21:13.590 --> 21:15.924
Am I safe? Yeah.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.125
Is it all good?

21:17.127 --> 21:18.393
Oh, hell, yeah.

21:18.395 --> 21:19.394
[Chuckles]

21:19.396 --> 21:21.062
On the good side, at least I
ain't gotta have a meeting with

21:21.064 --> 21:21.897
Lane when I get back this time.

21:21.931 --> 21:25.534
He'll be in Prudhoe.

21:25.536 --> 21:31.640
Narrator: 2,000 miles away
in Winnipeg... [coughs]

21:31.642 --> 21:32.340
[Grunts]

21:32.342 --> 21:36.178
Narrator: Rick's on his way to the
hospital with an unknown illness.

21:36.180 --> 21:38.680
I just feel like I been playing
the game of swallowing

21:38.682 --> 21:40.715
barbed wire and ripping
it out of my throat.

21:40.717 --> 21:41.983
[Coughs]

21:41.985 --> 21:45.454
I just thought I had a
cold I can't get rid of.

21:45.456 --> 21:47.722
Narrator: And worse yet, there's
a chance that something

21:47.724 --> 21:50.058
in his truck is to blame.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.761
Hugh found a company that'll come
in and clean it all out and

21:52.763 --> 21:57.866
disinfect everything and...
All I can do is get checked out

21:57.868 --> 22:00.168
and hopefully the nurse is cute.

22:00.170 --> 22:02.904
[Grunts]

22:05.441 --> 22:07.375
Urgent care, that's what I need.

22:07.443 --> 22:11.713
[Coughs]

22:11.715 --> 22:14.549
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Rick could be really sick.

22:14.551 --> 22:16.818
Narrator: A lethal outbreak.

22:16.820 --> 22:17.719
Why can't it be fucking

22:17.721 --> 22:20.989
Hughie down here with-- Why the
fuck did it have to happen to me?

22:23.299 --> 22:27.235
Narrator: - At Polar Industries in Winnipeg...
- This is a really dirty truck.

22:27.237 --> 22:31.873
Narrator: A team's been brought
in to check out Rick's truck.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.041
We gotta do the roof.

22:33.043 --> 22:35.043
We gotta do all the
instrumentation.

22:35.045 --> 22:36.945
Have to do the cab, everything.

22:36.947 --> 22:39.414
Narrator: They're searching the
rig for anything that could

22:39.416 --> 22:42.383
cause a major infection.

22:42.385 --> 22:44.953
Gotta get in here too.

22:44.955 --> 22:47.755
All the cupboards.

22:47.757 --> 22:51.859
Just throw it out.

22:51.861 --> 22:56.130
Narrator: - And the search...
- Deer mice, yeah.

22:56.198 --> 22:58.166
Narrator: Takes a deadly turn.

22:58.168 --> 23:01.035
There's some serious
evidence of mouse feces.

23:01.037 --> 23:04.339
There's definitely been some
mice in here for some time.

23:04.341 --> 23:04.405
Mice in here for some time.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.140
They've been hoarding in here.

23:06.142 --> 23:08.609
It's a really good chance that
they could have hantavirus, and

23:08.611 --> 23:12.714
if that mouse has hantavirus,
then Rick could be really sick.

23:12.716 --> 23:15.516
Narrator: All season, Rick's
been living and breathing with

23:15.518 --> 23:17.251
a deer mouse infestation.

23:17.253 --> 23:18.886
[Coughing]

23:18.888 --> 23:21.589
Narrator: Deer mice can
carry the hantavirus, a

23:21.591 --> 23:27.428
life-threatening disease with flu-like
symptoms and high mortality rates.

23:27.430 --> 23:30.031
Everything's gotta go because
you can't clean it and

23:30.033 --> 23:33.534
it's got, you know, potential
of being-- of having hantavirus

23:33.536 --> 23:35.536
bacteria on there.

23:35.538 --> 23:37.972
Everything that is touching his
face like this has gotta be

23:37.974 --> 23:40.875
thrown out for sure.

23:40.877 --> 23:46.080
Narrator: While the clean-out crew
digs deeper... at the hospital...

23:46.082 --> 23:47.548
It is a deer mouse.

23:47.550 --> 23:49.183
How do they figure that?

23:49.185 --> 23:52.053
They got the guy down there right now.

23:52.055 --> 23:52.086
Right now.

23:52.121 --> 23:53.254
Oh, motherfucker.

23:53.256 --> 23:57.992
So I'm-- I could have hantavirus
or whatever the fuck it is.

24:02.398 --> 24:04.332
Oh, God.

24:10.172 --> 24:16.778
It is a deer mouse, so...
It's not good 'cause they say

24:16.780 --> 24:22.517
it's, like, a 2% survival
rate if you get hantavirus.

24:22.519 --> 24:22.550
If you get hantavirus.

24:22.584 --> 24:24.285
Thought that ice road trucking
would take my life by going

24:24.287 --> 24:25.720
through the ice, not a fucking

24:25.722 --> 24:27.822
stupid mouse.

24:34.530 --> 24:35.730
I don't want to do this, really.

24:35.732 --> 24:42.103
Now I'm kind of freaked
out about this.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.305
Why the fuck did it
have to happen to me?

24:44.307 --> 24:48.276
Why can't it be fucking Hughie down
here with the fucking deer mouse bullshit?

24:52.181 --> 24:57.018
Narrator: - In the far reaches of
northwest Canada... - Spike brake is on.

24:57.020 --> 24:59.720
Warning. Spike brake is on.

24:59.722 --> 25:02.857
Narrator: Alex Debogorski
is in trouble.

25:02.859 --> 25:06.561
What do you mean, "a
spike brake is on"?

25:06.563 --> 25:12.867
Narrator: He's driving a malfunctioning
truck over thin river ice...

25:12.869 --> 25:17.438
With a load that's 15,000
pounds over the safe limit.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.607
Warning. Spike brake is on.

25:19.609 --> 25:22.343
Warning. Spike brake is on.

25:22.345 --> 25:25.346
Warning. Spike brake is on.

25:25.348 --> 25:26.547
Why does it think it's on?

25:26.549 --> 25:27.648
I don't know.

25:27.650 --> 25:27.715
I don't know.

25:27.749 --> 25:30.351
Warning. Spike brake is on.

25:30.353 --> 25:36.023
Warning. Spike brake is on.

25:36.025 --> 25:38.593
Narrator: Normally, failing
brakes would cause a driver to

25:38.595 --> 25:42.830
pull over immediately.

25:42.832 --> 25:48.002
But on thin ice with an overweight
load, stopping is not an option.

25:48.004 --> 25:50.204
The computer keeps telling me the
spike's on, that the brakes

25:50.206 --> 25:52.940
are on on the trailer, but the
trailer brakes aren't on.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.108
Spike brake is on.

25:54.110 --> 25:56.911
Truck thinks one thing and I
think something different, so

25:56.913 --> 25:59.113
I'm just ignoring
it the best I can.

25:59.115 --> 26:02.183
Warning. Spike brake is on.

26:11.393 --> 26:13.928
Whoa, baby.

26:13.930 --> 26:14.562
[Ice cracking]

26:14.564 --> 26:17.465
Whoa!

26:17.467 --> 26:21.736
Come on, baby, we're
almost there.

26:21.738 --> 26:24.672
Warning. Spike brake is on.

26:24.674 --> 26:28.676
Warning. Spike brake is on.

26:28.678 --> 26:36.584
Narrator: - After three white-knuckled hours...
- Warning. Spike brake is on.

26:36.586 --> 26:39.954
I am off the ice.

26:39.956 --> 26:43.157
Well, despite whatever the silly
computer's talking about,

26:43.159 --> 26:47.962
I am finally here in Aklavik.

26:47.964 --> 26:53.234
Narrator: Alex makes it to Aklavik
and delivers the excavator.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.035
Hey, Alex.

26:54.037 --> 26:54.969
How are you, Bill?

26:54.971 --> 26:56.504
Good, glad you made it here.

26:56.506 --> 26:59.574
Thank you very much.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.709
The truck has a few ghosts in
the computer, I guess you can

27:01.711 --> 27:06.113
call it, but I brought
the excavator here.

27:06.181 --> 27:08.516
I'm ready to head back to Inuvik
and see if they've got something

27:08.518 --> 27:14.288
else for me to do.

27:14.290 --> 27:21.762
Narrator: - 400 miles to the southwest...
- 27 degrees and the road is

27:21.764 --> 27:24.665
slick today.

27:24.700 --> 27:28.569
Narrator: Darrell and Porkchop
hit a stretch of bad weather.

27:28.571 --> 27:29.604
So we're down to one lane.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.340
Snowdrifts on both
sides of the road.

27:32.342 --> 27:36.711
Narrator: And news of Jack's
departure has Darrell racing to

27:36.713 --> 27:38.346
pick up another load.

27:38.348 --> 27:44.318
You know, Lane running Jack's
truck, this is perfect for me to

27:44.320 --> 27:46.587
pull the lead in load count.

27:46.589 --> 27:50.124
Jack may be the ace of the haul
road up here, but, uh, sometimes

27:50.126 --> 27:52.960
the new guy takes down the ace.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.363
That's the way it's
gonna be here.

27:55.365 --> 27:57.531
Watch out, Jack Jessee.

27:57.533 --> 28:00.801
I've got your number.

28:02.804 --> 28:05.606
And we're starting
up the Beaver Slide.

28:05.608 --> 28:10.678
Hopefully it won't
be too terrible bad.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.481
Narrator: Only 200 miles from
grabbing another load in

28:13.483 --> 28:19.086
Fairbanks, Darrell doesn't
waste time chaining up.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.621
I can feel that it's slick.

28:20.623 --> 28:22.790
You know, you got the feel of the
road anyway and you kind of

28:22.792 --> 28:26.627
know what it's doing, so
just drive accordingly.

28:26.629 --> 28:29.397
Narrator: He's betting that his
skill alone will get him up

28:29.399 --> 28:33.000
the mile-long Beaver
Slide incline.

28:46.281 --> 28:50.618
I came up the Beaver Slide,
never slipped a wheel.

28:50.686 --> 28:52.453
Well, you know, Darrell, I'm
gonna drag my feet so I can get

28:52.455 --> 28:56.057
a good run at her.

28:56.091 --> 28:58.893
Narrator: And to keep up
with his convoy partner...

28:58.895 --> 29:01.095
Fixin' to wind her
up, see what we got.

29:01.097 --> 29:03.464
Hope we'll make it to
the top of the Beaver.

29:03.466 --> 29:08.069
Narrator: Porkchop also hits the
steep grade without chains.

29:08.071 --> 29:14.809
Well, I decided not to chain up, but
this road sure is greasy looking.

29:14.811 --> 29:18.112
We're gonna have
to slow it down.

29:24.353 --> 29:26.220
I don't know whether this
was a good idea or not.

29:26.222 --> 29:27.855
I'm already losing traction.

29:27.857 --> 29:29.724
[Tires grinding]

29:29.726 --> 29:33.928
Shit! Fuck.

29:33.930 --> 29:35.463
Come on, baby girl.

29:42.771 --> 29:46.674
Dig, bitch!

29:51.747 --> 29:53.114
All right, I'm spun.

29:53.116 --> 29:54.749
That's it.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.751
Son of a bitch.

29:56.753 --> 30:01.288
Narrator: - Coming up...
- It is complete darkness.

30:01.290 --> 30:03.391
Narrator: An explosive delivery.

30:03.393 --> 30:04.825
Hello!

30:04.827 --> 30:06.227
I don't want to get shot.

30:06.229 --> 30:08.496
Hello? Hello!

30:10.801 --> 30:14.270
Narrator: - On the Dalton...
- I don't know whether this

30:14.272 --> 30:15.171
was a good idea or not.

30:15.173 --> 30:17.006
I'm already losing traction.

30:17.008 --> 30:20.376
Narrator: Porkchop's spinning
out on the Beaver Slide.

30:20.378 --> 30:22.078
Dig, bitch!

30:22.080 --> 30:24.246
[Tires grinding]

30:29.119 --> 30:30.820
All right, I'm spun.

30:30.822 --> 30:32.154
That's it.

30:32.156 --> 30:37.626
Son of a bitch.

30:37.628 --> 30:38.994
Yeah, I'm stopped.

30:38.996 --> 30:41.630
We're gonna have
to sling chains.

30:41.632 --> 30:42.732
Yeah, copy that.

30:42.734 --> 30:45.835
I'll just pull out at the top.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.103
Now I got another delay.

30:47.105 --> 30:50.306
You know, it's a three-day trip
already and Porkchop wipes his

30:50.308 --> 30:53.109
feet in the middle
of the Beaver Slide.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.745
Narrator: His only option is to
chain up in the middle of the

30:55.747 --> 30:57.380
steep incline.

30:57.382 --> 30:58.748
[Sighs]

30:58.750 --> 31:00.116
Darrell was blazing the trail.

31:00.118 --> 31:02.084
He took all the traction.

31:02.086 --> 31:03.753
It's not whether he's a
better driver or not.

31:03.755 --> 31:06.188
He had better traction.

31:06.190 --> 31:08.357
[Grunts]

31:08.359 --> 31:12.962
[Horn honks]

31:12.964 --> 31:17.867
And we're good.

31:17.869 --> 31:19.201
Come on, come on, Porkchop.

31:19.203 --> 31:21.871
Where are you?

31:21.873 --> 31:24.707
[Engine rumbling]

31:24.709 --> 31:26.609
[Chains clinking]

31:33.884 --> 31:40.990
Narrator: Chained up, Porkchop
grinds his way up the slope...

31:40.992 --> 31:45.428
and finally reaches the top.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.362
[Horn honks]

31:46.396 --> 31:50.232
Aggravating.

31:50.234 --> 31:52.802
I don't think there's
any hope for Porkchop.

31:52.804 --> 31:54.904
He's out of his element here.

31:54.938 --> 31:58.808
Oh, I'll be glad to land this
thing in Fairbanks and get rid

31:58.810 --> 32:02.545
of this convoy.

32:08.285 --> 32:11.253
Narrator: - 50 miles to the north...
- We're making really good

32:11.255 --> 32:14.623
time 'cause I don't want to
get an earful of bullshit.

32:14.625 --> 32:17.860
Narrator: Austin Wheeler is
licking his wounds after a day

32:17.862 --> 32:21.797
of being teased for
moving too slow.

32:21.799 --> 32:27.269
I just thought it was kind of BS,
but it is what it is, so...

32:30.974 --> 32:34.443
Well, Austin, we got a
guy spun out on Koyukuk.

32:34.445 --> 32:37.112
Okay.

32:37.147 --> 32:40.182
Narrator: But up ahead, a
truck's blocking the road and

32:40.184 --> 32:44.353
Dalton traffic comes to a halt.

32:44.355 --> 32:46.922
Looks like there's a
tanker that's spun out.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.558
Sounds like he just missed
a gear going up the hill.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.394
So there's three trucks
including me sitting here

32:52.396 --> 32:55.164
waiting for him to chain up.

32:55.166 --> 32:57.633
What is this guy doing?

32:57.635 --> 32:58.534
How's it going, bud?

32:58.536 --> 32:59.535
Good. How's it going?

32:59.537 --> 33:01.136
Good. My name is Fred.

33:01.138 --> 33:02.137
Hello, I am Austin.

33:02.139 --> 33:02.972
Austin?

33:02.974 --> 33:04.039
Nice to meet you.

33:04.074 --> 33:05.407
[Horn honks]

33:05.409 --> 33:08.711
Come on, now. Come on, now.

33:08.713 --> 33:12.681
Ford pickups. Come on, now.

33:12.716 --> 33:14.617
Giving you a little hard time
about the pickup thing there.

33:14.619 --> 33:15.351
Ah.

33:15.353 --> 33:17.052
You seemed a little frustrated.

33:17.054 --> 33:18.521
I just wanted to come
and talk to you.

33:18.523 --> 33:19.255
Yeah.

33:19.257 --> 33:19.955
Put a face to it.

33:19.957 --> 33:20.623
No, I'm sorry.

33:20.625 --> 33:21.323
It's all right.

33:21.325 --> 33:22.725
I had a rough morning,
this morning.

33:22.727 --> 33:23.492
I know, I understand.

33:23.494 --> 33:24.527
I know how it goes.

33:24.529 --> 33:27.329
Everybody is probably picking on you
and you got a lot of stuff going on.

33:27.331 --> 33:28.130
Yeah, it sucks.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.164
I'm sorry I came off wrong.

33:29.166 --> 33:29.865
That's all right.

33:29.867 --> 33:30.633
I'm usually not like that.

33:30.635 --> 33:34.169
I just-- It sucks when you work
this hard to be a heavy hauler

33:34.171 --> 33:38.173
at 23 years old and you
know everybody hates you.

33:38.175 --> 33:40.142
Well, don't worry about it.

33:40.144 --> 33:40.809
Yeah.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.244
I mean, I started this
deal when I was 18.

33:42.246 --> 33:43.012
Right.

33:43.014 --> 33:44.446
Got my first truck
when I was 18.

33:44.448 --> 33:45.180
Oh, right on.

33:45.182 --> 33:48.183
I was the youngest man-- youngest one
hired at a couple different places.

33:48.185 --> 33:49.184
Right, right.

33:49.186 --> 33:50.719
So I know how it is to be
sitting in your shoes.

33:50.721 --> 33:51.887
Yeah, it sucks.

33:51.889 --> 33:54.390
Just don't get your feathers
ruffled up 'cause we're just

33:54.392 --> 33:55.991
kinda picking on
you a little bit.

33:55.993 --> 33:56.792
Well, you can never tell.

33:56.794 --> 34:00.362
Well, looks like we're moving.

34:00.364 --> 34:01.096
All right, bud.

34:01.098 --> 34:01.830
All right, nice meeting you.

34:01.832 --> 34:02.531
It was good meeting you.

34:02.533 --> 34:05.634
I'm sure I'll see you again.

34:05.636 --> 34:08.103
Everybody that's driven the
road started out at the bottom

34:08.105 --> 34:11.139
like I have and has to work
their way up from there to get

34:11.141 --> 34:13.108
other people's respect.

34:13.110 --> 34:17.478
You know, I'm the new guy up
here, but, um, I think once

34:17.481 --> 34:22.751
people get to know me, I think,
uh, they'll warm up to me also.

34:22.753 --> 34:29.391
Narrator: While Austin puts the past
behind him, 40 miles to the north...

34:29.393 --> 34:32.995
Looks like we're getting close right
now, so we'll get this delivery made.

34:32.996 --> 34:37.399
Narrator: Lane and Harry approach
the end of their explosive haul...

34:37.400 --> 34:41.270
A gold mining operation with
an unusual drop site on the

34:41.272 --> 34:43.371
side of the Dalton.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.975
Made contact with the, uh,
customer yesterday and he asked

34:45.976 --> 34:48.677
us just to pull in and give a
couple honks on the horn and

34:48.679 --> 34:53.849
he'd come out and
meet us at the road.

34:53.851 --> 34:58.120
[Horn honks]

34:58.122 --> 35:00.389
Well, we'll see
if he comes now.

35:00.391 --> 35:03.225
That was the phone
call he asked for.

35:03.227 --> 35:08.130
Narrator: But no one's there.

35:08.132 --> 35:10.666
Ah, we'll give him one more
for good measure here.

35:10.668 --> 35:13.035
[Horn honks]

35:18.608 --> 35:21.410
You want to go ahead
and untie yours?

35:21.412 --> 35:24.113
Trail right there.

35:24.115 --> 35:27.583
Narrator: They can't leave
explosives on the side of the road.

35:27.585 --> 35:30.552
If they can't find the owner,
they'll have to haul this load

35:30.554 --> 35:35.491
all the way back to Fairbanks
and call this trip a bust.

35:35.493 --> 35:37.626
Well, we're just gonna walk back
in here see if we can find

35:37.628 --> 35:41.230
the customer maybe.

35:44.768 --> 35:48.137
Carlile, we always
go the extra mile.

35:48.139 --> 35:50.873
Charge overtime for this
frickin' operation.

35:50.875 --> 35:54.009
Narrator: Lane and Harry head into
the dark wilderness, hoping

35:54.011 --> 35:57.212
to find the mining team.

35:57.214 --> 35:59.782
I'm gonna wait here while Lane
jogs up to the top of the

35:59.784 --> 36:01.850
hill to see what's
on the other side.

36:01.852 --> 36:05.688
Hello!

36:05.722 --> 36:07.823
Just gonna walk back in
here a little further.

36:07.825 --> 36:10.292
It is complete darkness.

36:10.326 --> 36:15.130
"Area closed beyond this point...
Turn around here."

36:15.132 --> 36:16.999
Lane just went up there.

36:17.001 --> 36:18.767
I'll go back in here a little bit
further and see if we can't

36:18.769 --> 36:21.270
see something.

36:21.272 --> 36:23.605
Hello!

36:23.607 --> 36:26.108
Narrator: - Coming up...
- We gotta make sure nobody goes in there.

36:26.110 --> 36:28.444
Narrator: Biological warfare.

36:28.446 --> 36:31.246
This is fucked up.

36:31.248 --> 36:32.381
We're in lockdown.

36:34.062 --> 36:34.695
[Wolf howling]

36:34.697 --> 36:39.400
Narrator: Somewhere in the
Alaskan wilderness...

36:46.174 --> 36:49.410
Hello!

36:49.412 --> 36:52.312
Well, we're 20 miles north of
Coldfoot and, uh, we're about--

36:52.314 --> 36:54.715
I don't know, a 1/2 mile off
the Dalton highway right now

36:54.717 --> 36:57.418
walking back into the woods.

36:57.420 --> 36:59.920
Narrator: Lane's searching for
the miners that ordered a

36:59.922 --> 37:03.157
load of explosives.

37:03.159 --> 37:04.525
Well, we left Harry back
there a little ways.

37:04.527 --> 37:07.161
I think he's gonna walk back up
to the truck and I told him we'd

37:07.163 --> 37:10.764
continue on here and make a
little effort to get back in

37:10.766 --> 37:13.534
here a little further and see if
we can't find this gentleman and

37:13.536 --> 37:16.603
get him his product.

37:19.641 --> 37:22.242
Well, I see some lights up here
around the corner, so I think

37:22.244 --> 37:27.548
we're coming into a camp here,
so I'm just gonna yell.

37:27.550 --> 37:29.616
Hello!

37:29.651 --> 37:31.819
I don't wanna get shot.

37:31.821 --> 37:34.088
These are true Alaskans here.

37:38.426 --> 37:40.828
Oh, there's someone in there.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.529
Hello!

37:42.531 --> 37:49.703
Oh, yeah, I see some
of the guys now.

37:49.705 --> 37:50.471
How are you?

37:50.473 --> 37:51.338
Good.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.006
Lane Keator, Carlile,
nice to meet you.

37:53.008 --> 37:53.741
Okay.

37:53.743 --> 37:55.876
Yeah, we got your delivery
down at the road.

37:55.878 --> 37:57.878
We'll meet you out there and
we'll get this stuff moved out.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.979
Yeah, good.

37:58.981 --> 38:04.184
Narrator: With contact made, the
miners gear up to offload the cargo.

38:04.186 --> 38:07.387
Well, this is how we get
all our supply out here.

38:07.389 --> 38:10.157
[Beeping]

38:12.327 --> 38:13.794
This is quite the operation.

38:13.796 --> 38:14.828
You can't see it from the road.

38:14.830 --> 38:16.063
It's kinda neat.

38:16.065 --> 38:19.767
Yeah, there's not too many
underground placer deposits that

38:19.769 --> 38:21.769
are being mined anywhere.

38:21.771 --> 38:24.438
Narrator: Gold mining in Alaska
dates back to the Yukon

38:24.440 --> 38:26.707
gold rush in the 1890s.

38:26.709 --> 38:28.842
That's the entrance to the mine.

38:28.844 --> 38:32.446
Narrator: Since then, over
1.2 million pounds of the

38:32.448 --> 38:35.282
precious metal has been
extracted from the region.

38:35.284 --> 38:36.683
This is pay dirt, you guys.

38:36.685 --> 38:38.852
This is what we haul
out from underground.

38:38.854 --> 38:39.787
Oh, really?

38:39.789 --> 38:40.420
Yeah.

38:40.422 --> 38:42.122
That's what the
explosives are for.

38:42.124 --> 38:43.223
We drill it and shoot it.

38:43.225 --> 38:44.224
Okay.

38:44.226 --> 38:47.961
What we're doing is following
the ancestral course of gold

38:47.963 --> 38:49.696
creek underneath this bench.

38:49.698 --> 38:51.331
So we got a mile to go.

38:51.333 --> 38:55.202
And that mile will take
the rest of my life.

38:55.204 --> 39:00.240
Narrator: Back at the
trucks, the offload begins.

39:00.242 --> 39:04.411
This is truly an Alaskan deal
here, uh, unique Alaska.

39:04.413 --> 39:06.747
I mean, just-- Really it's a
couple people out here chasing

39:06.749 --> 39:09.116
their dream in the middle of
nowhere and we get to be a part

39:09.118 --> 39:09.883
of that tonight.

39:09.885 --> 39:14.254
That's pretty special.

39:14.256 --> 39:17.257
[Coughs]

39:17.259 --> 39:17.958
Okay?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.226
And we're set.

39:19.228 --> 39:22.062
Now we have a delivery
successfully made.

39:22.064 --> 39:23.063
Be careful back there.

39:23.065 --> 39:26.133
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:26.135 --> 39:32.539
Narrator: The Carlile brass rack up a
delivery and head back to Fairbanks.

39:32.541 --> 39:34.608
We still got a couple hundred
miles to go tonight, so

39:34.610 --> 39:40.714
we're gonna make
good work of this.

39:40.716 --> 39:40.747
This.

39:40.782 --> 39:46.987
Narrator: - 275 miles to the South...
- I'm gonna back this trailer in.

39:46.989 --> 39:48.088
I'm gonna drop it off.

39:48.090 --> 39:49.623
Be done with him.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.992
Narrator: Darrell and Porkchop
pull into the Carlile

39:51.994 --> 39:57.431
yard after a frustrating
round trip on the Dalton.

39:57.433 --> 40:02.069
Just one delay after another again,
you know, running in this convoy.

40:02.071 --> 40:05.639
Of all the trips I've made, this
one's not something that I want

40:05.641 --> 40:09.009
to repeat.

40:09.011 --> 40:12.079
Well, let's undo these lines.

40:12.081 --> 40:14.348
Convoy with Darrell
was what it was.

40:14.350 --> 40:15.816
Wasn't a good experience.

40:15.818 --> 40:16.984
Darrell's here for the money.

40:16.986 --> 40:18.185
He's here to win
the load count.

40:18.187 --> 40:20.454
I'm here for my
wife and family.

40:20.456 --> 40:23.357
I did what I had to do.

40:23.359 --> 40:24.825
I proved what I know I can do.

40:24.827 --> 40:26.193
I showed 'em.

40:26.195 --> 40:27.728
We're safe and
everybody's alive.

40:27.730 --> 40:29.563
That's all that matters.

40:35.270 --> 40:37.838
Narrator: On the opposite end
of the road, Austin's also

40:37.840 --> 40:41.742
pulling in for the night.

40:41.744 --> 40:43.176
[Groans]

40:43.178 --> 40:45.012
Today has just been
the longest day.

40:45.014 --> 40:49.750
There's just been a lot of frickin'
things today that have stacked up.

40:49.752 --> 40:54.121
I think I get enough shit to,
you know, last a while up here.

40:54.123 --> 40:54.154
You know, last a while up here.

40:54.188 --> 41:01.028
But, oh, well, I just keep
doing what I'm doing.

41:01.030 --> 41:07.567
Narrator: With Jack out of the race...
The bosses get on the board.

41:07.569 --> 41:11.104
And Darrell regains the lead.

41:14.709 --> 41:18.879
- At Polar Industries in Winnipeg, Canada...
- All right, we are gonna have

41:18.881 --> 41:19.680
to lay some traps in.

41:19.682 --> 41:20.580
All right.

41:20.582 --> 41:24.751
Narrator: Cleanup continues on
Rick Yemm's infested truck.

41:24.753 --> 41:28.221
Get it all set up so we
can get her in one shot.

41:28.223 --> 41:30.257
We'll line them up pretty much
wherever we saw that they were

41:30.259 --> 41:32.659
hoarding food before.

41:32.661 --> 41:34.761
They'll have a little big
surprise waiting for them.

41:34.763 --> 41:38.765
Narrator: - While the traps are set...
- All right, thanks.

41:38.866 --> 41:41.034
Narrator: Rick's returning
from the hospital.

41:41.036 --> 41:45.005
They're doing the blood work and
now I'm waiting for results, so...

41:45.007 --> 41:47.040
We thought maybe I
was just, like, allergic to fucking

41:47.042 --> 41:53.046
trucking or something, but it turns out
just the truck wanting to kill me.

41:53.048 --> 42:00.554
Narrator: While he waits on test
results, Rick checks in on his truck.

42:00.556 --> 42:01.855
Hey, how is it going?

42:01.889 --> 42:04.124
- Are you the, uh--
- Yeah, I'm the exterminator.

42:04.126 --> 42:07.127
Sean. How you doing?

42:10.598 --> 42:11.965
So where do we stand now?

42:11.967 --> 42:12.933
We haven't got
any in the truck?

42:12.935 --> 42:15.402
We definitely have to take the
truck apart, you know, you

42:15.404 --> 42:18.205
can't be getting on the road until
the truck's totally cleaned out.

42:18.207 --> 42:21.041
We don't wanna have that risk of
you getting any sick further.

42:21.043 --> 42:21.108
You getting any sick further.

42:21.142 --> 42:22.776
Well, like I said,
I'm sick enough now.

42:22.778 --> 42:24.578
I don't want to take any
more chances with the truck.

42:24.580 --> 42:27.681
So whatever it's got
to do to be done.

42:27.683 --> 42:30.517
This is fucked up.

42:30.519 --> 42:33.120
I got too much money in this
truck to just walk away from it

42:33.122 --> 42:34.621
and get it written off.

42:34.623 --> 42:36.790
So now I'm going
deeper in the hole.

42:36.792 --> 42:38.759
I'm fucking sick as hell.

42:38.761 --> 42:40.894
The truck's sick as hell.

42:40.896 --> 42:44.331
And they don't know for sure if
I've got the hantavirus or not.

42:44.333 --> 42:52.706
It's serious, you know, so...
I'm, uh-- That's where I stand right now.

42:58.346 --> 43:00.881
We gotta make sure
nobody goes in there.

43:00.883 --> 43:06.753
Very important.

43:06.755 --> 43:10.690
We're in lockdown.

43:10.692 --> 43:13.927
Narrator: Next time on
<i>Ice Road Truckers...</i>

43:13.929 --> 43:15.495
<i>This ain't gonna be pretty.</i>

43:15.497 --> 43:17.497
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

43:17.499 --> 43:21.868
<i>Narrator: - As the season nears
the halfway point... - Hold on!</i>

43:21.870 --> 43:24.771
<i>Narrator: - Drivers up the ante...
- Well, we're basically going</i>

43:24.773 --> 43:27.674
<i>from one floating chunk of
ice over to the other.</i>

43:27.676 --> 43:32.312
<i>Narrator: - With bigger loads...
- That's good push-truck material.</i>

43:32.314 --> 43:35.082
<i>Narrator: - Deadlier roads...
- Ain't nobody else ever been</i>

43:35.084 --> 43:37.284
<i>where I'm going.</i>

43:37.318 --> 43:40.053
<i>You know, this could happen
to anybody out here.</i>

43:40.055 --> 43:42.166
<i>Narrator: And thinner ice.</i>

43:43.003 --> 43:44.736
You hear the ice, just,
crack, crack, crack...

43:46.452 --> 43:48.539
And Jack's back!

43:48.574 --> 43:49.631
I thought you were gone.

43:49.666 --> 43:51.087
Get back to work.

43:51.122 --> 43:53.570
But the ace gets the
cold shoulder.

43:53.571 --> 43:54.999
Do you want my seat?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.898
I have seaten yours
while you were gone.
