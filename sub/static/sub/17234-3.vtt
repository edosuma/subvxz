WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:03.555
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.556 --> 00:05.642
You got us plane tickets to the Caribbean?

00:05.643 --> 00:07.562
If you say "yes", I'll buy the tickets.

00:07.563 --> 00:09.704
They're meeting with every single
artist on the label this week.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.912
I feel like I am looking at
the future of Edgehill.

00:11.913 --> 00:14.667
Bubblegum and glitter just aren't
things I care about anymore.

00:14.668 --> 00:16.872
Well, I do. They move records.

00:16.873 --> 00:18.283
You haven't signed your contract yet.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.923
You say the word, we start over.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.499
- Do I still get to work with Rayna?
- No.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.855
I'd like you to meet someone.
I just signed her.

00:23.856 --> 00:25.109
Wow. Hi!

00:25.110 --> 00:27.500
- You gotta protect your voice.
- I gotta protect my label.

00:27.855 --> 00:30.141
I don't have Rayna, and
I don't have my music.

00:30.142 --> 00:31.377
I got nothin'.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.079
(Yowls loudly)

00:33.389 --> 00:34.223
(Gags)

00:35.189 --> 00:36.677
(Exhales deeply and grunts)

00:36.678 --> 00:37.611
(Door opens)

00:37.612 --> 00:39.403
- You all right? What...
- (Panting) Uh-huh.

00:39.404 --> 00:40.709
I'm fine. I'm okay.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.427
- You have a nightmare?
- No.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.102
Just living one.

00:45.877 --> 00:47.647
I must've rolled on my hand.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.143
(Grunts)

00:49.144 --> 00:50.584
- Do you want I-ice or...
- No, no.

00:51.109 --> 00:53.280
Aspirin or... warm milk?

00:53.281 --> 00:54.884
I'm fine!

00:55.692 --> 00:57.479
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.299
You're just... Trying to help.

01:00.302 --> 01:02.157
How about you give me my Gibson?

01:02.713 --> 01:04.589
I won't plug it in.

01:04.912 --> 01:06.984
Thank you. (Sighs)

01:06.985 --> 01:09.232
Is this your idea of physical therapy?

01:09.233 --> 01:10.703
Somethin' like that.

01:11.889 --> 01:13.487
(Exhales deeply)

01:15.672 --> 01:17.342
Oh! Ahh.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.965
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.442
The kind of pain you're
in... It's not right.

01:23.443 --> 01:25.426
Yeah, well, one of two
things is gonna happen.

01:25.971 --> 01:28.194
It's either gonna go away...

01:28.931 --> 01:30.993
Or I'm-a get used to it. (Sighs)

01:33.412 --> 01:36.219
Any clarifications,
questions concerning custody?

01:36.220 --> 01:37.353
Anything?

01:37.891 --> 01:39.135
No.

01:39.136 --> 01:40.135
No, I'm good.

01:40.136 --> 01:41.860
All right, sign the
decrees where indicated,

01:42.242 --> 01:43.653
and your divorce will be final.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.171
(Papers rustle)

01:46.595 --> 01:47.723
(Scribbling)

01:51.291 --> 01:52.366
(Teddy) There you go.

01:53.261 --> 01:54.516
Is that it?

01:54.517 --> 01:55.825
That is it.

01:55.826 --> 01:58.117
Would you, uh, would you mind
giving us a minute, please?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.023
Thank you.

02:03.671 --> 02:05.765
So the, uh, the girls
are with me this week?

02:06.421 --> 02:08.088
Till Sunday. (Door closes)

02:08.089 --> 02:09.401
Right.

02:11.072 --> 02:12.913
Never thought it would end like this.

02:13.522 --> 02:15.216
Neither did I.

02:16.561 --> 02:18.166
But we love our daughters.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.749
And, Rayna, they are our daughters, so...

02:23.631 --> 02:25.299
Thank you.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.909
You're a good father.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.029
And you're a good man.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.842
And I want you to be happy.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.076
You, too.

02:37.332 --> 02:38.972
Well...

02:39.703 --> 02:40.952
(Exhales deeply)

02:42.771 --> 02:44.309
(Door opens)

02:45.890 --> 02:47.356
Oh, my gosh.

02:47.979 --> 02:48.726
Seriously?

02:48.727 --> 02:53.701
This is so crazy... Just running
into Juliette Barnes at the office.

02:53.702 --> 02:55.800
I-I still can't believe
we're on the same label.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.387
- Neither can I.
- It was such an honor

02:57.388 --> 02:58.999
singing your song the other night.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.065
I mean, it was terrifying,

03:00.066 --> 03:01.415
with you standing right
there and all, but, um,

03:01.416 --> 03:02.729
just a real honor.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.361
Well, I'd imagine it takes
some of the pressure off,

03:04.362 --> 03:05.977
singing somebody else's hits.

03:06.332 --> 03:09.052
It's kinda like... karaoke.

03:10.002 --> 03:12.566
Right. (Chuckles nervously) Right.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.258
Well, um, it... it was
so nice seeing you again.

03:15.259 --> 03:16.744
(Telephone ringing in distance)

03:16.745 --> 03:18.205
(Footsteps depart)

03:18.677 --> 03:20.686
- Was that really necessary?
- Oh, come on.

03:20.687 --> 03:21.673
Don't tell me you're actually buying

03:21.674 --> 03:23.258
that "fresh off the farm" act.

03:23.259 --> 03:24.533
He's ready for you, miss Barnes.

03:25.025 --> 03:26.508
Hallelujah.

03:28.383 --> 03:29.781
Apologize for the wait.

03:29.782 --> 03:31.976
You obviously have your priorities.

03:31.977 --> 03:33.234
(Glenn) Well, what Juliette means is that

03:33.235 --> 03:34.713
it's been kind of a hectic week...

03:34.714 --> 03:36.427
Look, I don't know how or why, but we seem

03:36.428 --> 03:38.508
to have gotten off on the wrong foot here,

03:38.509 --> 03:40.006
and I want to apologize for whatever part

03:40.007 --> 03:41.523
that I might have played in it.

03:41.874 --> 03:43.910
But to be clear, you are
a very important member

03:43.911 --> 03:46.437
of the Edgehill family.
I want you to know that.

03:46.819 --> 03:48.556
Oh, I know that.

03:48.557 --> 03:50.629
Good. Then perhaps
you'll reconsider singing

03:50.630 --> 03:52.034
at the stockholder showcase.

03:52.035 --> 03:54.104
- We're looking into it. That's right...
- Sorry. No can do.

03:54.105 --> 03:56.923
Look, this event is crucial
to our reboot of the label.

03:56.924 --> 03:58.679
We need the stockholders to get excited

03:58.680 --> 04:00.295
about this new direction that I'm taking.

04:00.296 --> 04:02.559
It's a focus on fresh, new talent.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.993
It's a focus that you inspired, by the way.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.238
You know, I would love to reschedule...

04:07.239 --> 04:09.203
<i>I really would... For them.</i>

04:09.204 --> 04:10.709
But my conflict is a private,

04:10.710 --> 04:12.988
one-night-only concert for
Charles and Olivia Wentworth

04:12.989 --> 04:14.628
at their estate in Maryland.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.848
It's their 5-year anniversary,

04:15.849 --> 04:17.980
and apparently I am
Olivia's favorite singer.

04:18.482 --> 04:20.175
The Wentworth family, huh?

04:20.176 --> 04:22.173
Mm-hmm. I don't think I need to tell you

04:22.174 --> 04:24.321
how many radio stations they own,

04:24.322 --> 04:27.470
not to mention magazines,
newspapers, and TV stations.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.389
Or I could just cancel

04:29.390 --> 04:31.495
and leave the Wentworths very disappointed.

04:34.818 --> 04:36.550
Have fun in Maryland.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.215
Thank you.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.946
I'll send you some crabs.

04:42.988 --> 04:44.448
(Rayna) No, no, let's figure this out.

04:44.449 --> 04:46.492
How are we gonna get me
out of my Edgehill contract?

04:46.493 --> 04:49.317
Well, it's not gonna be easy.
You still owe 'em a record.

04:49.318 --> 04:51.395
And you'd have to buy yourself out.

04:51.396 --> 04:53.138
Uh, have you heard anything from Liam?

04:53.139 --> 04:55.832
No. He sent me flowers
while I was in the hospital,

04:55.833 --> 04:57.148
but I've tried him a couple times.

04:57.149 --> 04:59.391
He's not calling me back.
Maybe now that I'm not dead,

04:59.392 --> 05:01.146
he's decided to be mad at me again.

05:01.147 --> 05:02.206
Surely he's not still upset

05:02.207 --> 05:04.027
with you for not going
to St. Lucia with him?

05:04.028 --> 05:06.685
I don't know. How many
times does a guy like that

05:06.686 --> 05:08.747
get stood up at the airport?

05:08.748 --> 05:10.014
- Once.
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.015 --> 05:12.528
(Doorbell rings) Mm. Gotta be Scarlett.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.061
- Would you mind getting that, please?
- (Woman) Got it.

05:14.062 --> 05:16.926
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Well... (Sighs)

05:16.927 --> 05:18.499
You're gonna have to deliver that album.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.466
Listen, I'll just keep
trying Liam. (Door opens)

05:20.467 --> 05:22.543
And you know what? I will
be nice to Jeff... (Chuckles)

05:22.544 --> 05:25.689
(Chuckles) If it means it will
get out of this Edgehill contract.

05:25.690 --> 05:26.978
Keep your enemies close.

05:26.979 --> 05:28.311
Yes.

05:28.312 --> 05:30.389
(Chuckles) Well, regardless,
it's gonna be, uh...

05:31.027 --> 05:32.777
It'll be good to get you back
in the studio. (Door closes)

05:32.778 --> 05:33.812
Get you singing again.

05:33.813 --> 05:35.575
(Footsteps approach)

05:35.576 --> 05:37.054
Scarlett.

05:37.055 --> 05:38.394
- Hi!
- There she is.

05:38.709 --> 05:39.900
Hey, girl.

05:39.901 --> 05:40.916
How are you?

05:40.917 --> 05:42.876
- I'm good. Welcome!
- Thank you.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.029
Come on in.

05:44.030 --> 05:45.275
Hi. Say hi to Bucky.

05:45.276 --> 05:46.565
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Good to see you.

05:46.566 --> 05:48.052
Your house is amazing.

05:48.053 --> 05:49.857
- Oh, thank you. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

05:49.858 --> 05:51.738
Make yourself at home.
You're part of the family now.

05:51.739 --> 05:53.134
- Oh. (Laughs)
- Want some sweet tea?

05:53.135 --> 05:54.587
Oh, yes, please.

05:56.532 --> 05:57.895
Bucky, I know you don't want any.

05:57.896 --> 05:59.870
No, I'm good, thank
you. (Ice cubes clinking)

05:59.871 --> 06:01.418
So, Scarlett,

06:01.419 --> 06:03.108
you remember that Jeff Fordham?

06:03.109 --> 06:04.153
Yeah. (Pitcher clatters)

06:04.154 --> 06:05.896
Well, he's doing this big showcase

06:05.897 --> 06:07.986
for all the stockholders of the company,

06:07.987 --> 06:09.830
you know, who own half the world,

06:09.831 --> 06:11.595
including you and me at this point.

06:11.596 --> 06:12.769
Oh.

06:13.341 --> 06:17.703
<i>Um, but now that you are the
sole artist of Highway 65,</i>

06:17.704 --> 06:20.344
you and I can go and take
advantage of the situation,

06:20.345 --> 06:21.516
shake hands with some suits and get'em

06:21.517 --> 06:24.049
- really excited about Highway 65.
- Okay.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.599
And Edgehill is very excited
about you being there.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.773
They're getting you a stylist and all that.

06:28.774 --> 06:30.407
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Mm-hmm.

06:30.408 --> 06:31.591
- And intimidating also.
- Yeah.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.050
But, hey, listen.

06:33.051 --> 06:35.042
The clothes are gonna be awesome.

06:35.043 --> 06:36.606
I reckon it'll be fine.

06:36.607 --> 06:38.638
I reckon it will. Cheers to that.

(Sighs) Man, that song is great.

07:27.425 --> 07:29.690
Oh! Uh, leaving me alone, I hope.

07:30.030 --> 07:32.071
I'm getting a new style.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.421
Hmm.

once. Does that count?

07:52.785 --> 07:54.119

07:55.260 --> 07:56.367
I'm glad you're here.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.103
Really? Yeah.

07:58.104 --> 07:59.475
Maybe they'll be so busy paying attention

07:59.476 --> 08:01.410
to your bad manners,
they won't notice mine.

08:01.411 --> 08:02.963
(Chuckles) Nice. Real nice. (Chuckles)

08:02.964 --> 08:04.587

- Hi.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.665
Hi. I'm Charlie. This is my wife Olivia.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.147
- Avery.
- Juliette.

08:10.148 --> 08:12.611
- Oh! I'm so excited to have you here.
- Hey, mate.

08:12.612 --> 08:14.859
- Thank you.
- Olivia is your biggest fan.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.543
Oh, Charlie is the
world's greatest husband.

08:17.544 --> 08:20.046
Best fifth-year anniversary present ever.

08:20.656 --> 08:24.637

Hey.

Hey. (Laughs)

How are ya?

08:31.770 --> 08:32.866
Good.

08:32.866 --> 08:35.629
Thank you. Thanks for,
uh, thanks for showing up.

08:35.630 --> 08:36.739
Sure.

08:36.740 --> 08:37.772
You look well.

08:37.773 --> 08:40.110
- Thanks. Thanks. I feel good.
- Good.

08:40.111 --> 08:42.035
Good. I'm glad you pulled through, babe.

08:42.037 --> 08:43.438
Yeah, me, too.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.501
St. Lucia was beautiful, by the way.

08:47.057 --> 08:48.580
You should have come.

08:48.581 --> 08:50.792
In retrospect, I wish I had.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.548
How can I help you?

08:53.549 --> 08:55.674
Well, I wanna finish our record...

08:56.424 --> 08:57.932
And I wanna do it with you.

08:58.921 --> 09:00.347
- That's nice.
- Yeah, I feel like

09:00.348 --> 09:02.931
what we had in the studio
was... was really great.

09:03.552 --> 09:05.865
You inspired me. You inspired the album.

09:07.127 --> 09:08.909
I don't wanna do it without you.

09:09.286 --> 09:12.102
I feel like we can just
let go whatever happened

09:12.103 --> 09:13.853
and just make it about the music.

09:16.821 --> 09:18.411
I'm booked.

Well, you already kinda begged.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.413
I did not beg.

10:27.414 --> 10:28.753
But you didn't really apologize.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.916
I'm sorry. Did that do the trick?

10:31.917 --> 10:33.518

No, I know. You're so busy.

10:49.510 --> 10:51.248
I really appreciate you coming by.

10:51.249 --> 10:54.150
I have the doctor's statements

11:34.853 --> 11:36.748

us sharing a car, is there?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.517

14:33.518 --> 14:35.103
Did I say "car"? I meant "limo."

14:46.323 --> 14:48.305
may have arisen over the handling of Will,

14:48.306 --> 14:50.514
focus on what is most important right now.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.934
Which is you and your career.

14:52.301 --> 14:54.720
Well... that's what I wanna focus on, too.

14:55.126 --> 14:57.203
- Okay.
- And I'm glad to hear you say that,

14:57.204 --> 14:58.545
'cause I'm about to get back in the studio

14:58.546 --> 15:00.587
with Liam McGuinnis to finish that album.

15:00.588 --> 15:01.815
That's wonderful.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.121
That's... that's great.

15:04.122 --> 15:06.356
- Great.
- And if you turn this around quickly enough,

15:06.729 --> 15:08.479
we can capitalize on recent events.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.059
We can make this the biggest launch

15:10.060 --> 15:11.352
in Edgehill history.

15:11.928 --> 15:15.642
(Chuckles) Um, I don't know
whether to be offended by your cynicism

15:15.643 --> 15:17.802
or flattered by your confidence. (Chuckles)

15:17.803 --> 15:19.747
The latter, all right?

15:19.748 --> 15:21.806
And the stockholders
are in town this weekend,

15:21.807 --> 15:24.469
and so this is the perfect
time to tee this all up

15:24.470 --> 15:25.960
by singing one of your new songs.

15:26.487 --> 15:27.545
What do you say?

15:27.546 --> 15:29.568
Um, I thought Juliette was singing.

15:29.569 --> 15:33.171
No. No, I decided against
that. She's not performing.

15:33.172 --> 15:34.924
Well, I think that it might be beneficial

15:34.925 --> 15:39.438
to hold these songs until we're ready
to roll out the new album.

15:39.751 --> 15:41.084
Okay. No, that... that's fine.

15:41.085 --> 15:43.803
Just sing something that
everyone knows all the words to.

15:44.167 --> 15:45.564
You know, one of your many hits.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.642
Is there a problem?

15:50.097 --> 15:52.709
No. No problem.

15:52.710 --> 15:55.313
(Man) I feel like I may talk
a little too much sometimes,

15:55.314 --> 15:58.327
but, uh, who else is gonna
listen to a guy like me?

15:58.931 --> 16:00.356
You're supposed to call your sponsor

16:00.357 --> 16:02.493
when you're in trouble, not hide from him.

16:03.728 --> 16:06.778
I haven't had a drink or taken a pill
since that accident.

16:07.196 --> 16:08.324
And that's all well and good,

16:08.637 --> 16:10.517
but just 'cause you sober, doesn't mean
you working the program.

16:10.518 --> 16:13.693
I'm sitting here and the pain
is about to kill me, all right?

16:12.693 --> 16:14.168
Ain't the pain in your
arm that's the problem.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.153
The problem is how you gonna
deal with this Maddie thing.

16:17.154 --> 16:18.809
(Whispers) Cole, I don't
need your help anymore.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.782

it no more. We're moving.

16:24.516 --> 16:25.421

16:25.942 --> 16:28.285
For years, I've been turning
down real good job offers

16:28.286 --> 16:29.968
that would take me out of Nashville.

16:30.744 --> 16:32.397
One came through, and...

16:33.342 --> 16:35.145
Audrey and I have decided to say yes,

16:35.146 --> 16:36.710
so, yeah, we're moving.

16:36.711 --> 16:39.862

thanks for the heads up.

16:41.159 --> 16:42.939

chance to try somethin' new.

somethin' will come to you.

about playing it once.

17:37.076 --> 17:38.663
And isn't the whole point
of being a songwriter

17:38.664 --> 17:39.955
with a publishing deal

17:39.956 --> 17:41.196
is so you can get your songs out there

17:41.197 --> 17:42.605
for someone else to work on?

17:43.616 --> 17:45.041
Well, since you're not a songwriter,

17:45.042 --> 17:46.359
you probably wouldn't know.

17:48.588 --> 17:50.305
I know a good song when I hear it.

17:50.716 --> 17:52.848
I know when somebody's
getting in their own way, too.

17:54.888 --> 17:57.663
I know that Will is very nice to look at,

17:57.664 --> 17:59.658
but you should be careful,
'cause when it comes to girls,

17:59.659 --> 18:00.986
he can be kind of a dog.

18:00.987 --> 18:03.137
He asked me to go to the showcase with him

18:03.138 --> 18:04.266
as his date.

18:04.267 --> 18:05.905
Oh, of course he did. What did you say?

18:05.906 --> 18:07.827
I said yes to us all sharing a limo...

18:08.401 --> 18:10.150
You, me, Will, and Gunnar?

18:10.151 --> 18:12.714
Oh, that's gonna be fun.
It'll be like a double date,

18:12.715 --> 18:14.216
except me and Gunnar aren't dating anymore.

18:14.217 --> 18:15.583
Won't be weird at all.

18:15.584 --> 18:17.281
You're right. I wasn't thinking.

18:17.617 --> 18:19.285
Mm, don't worry about it. You
know, I'm gonna call him right now.

18:19.286 --> 18:20.545
I'm gonna fix this. (Cell phone rings)

18:20.546 --> 18:21.742
No, don't. I can handle it.

18:21.743 --> 18:23.930
Yeah, don't worry. Oh. Hold on. (Ring)

18:23.931 --> 18:25.145
Rayna, hi.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.154
Yeah, I can keep a secret.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.874
(Juliette) Make sure Charlie's
mic's turned off just in case,

18:33.875 --> 18:36.436
and we'll do "Can't Help Falling in Love"
for the encore.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.410
Everybody cool with that?

18:38.411 --> 18:41.240
All right, take ten, and then
we'll give it a spin. Thanks.

18:41.658 --> 18:44.048
I always knew you were a romantic at heart.

18:45.368 --> 18:47.641
Yes, I am truly, deeply in love

18:47.642 --> 18:49.824
with the million dollars
that they're paying me.

18:49.825 --> 18:52.180
Nice try, but it's not all about the money.

18:52.181 --> 18:53.527
You're way too happy.

18:54.397 --> 18:55.987
All right, fine, it's not about the money.

18:55.988 --> 18:57.235
It's about the fact that I'm not doing

18:57.236 --> 18:58.976
what the head of my label
wants me to right now,

18:58.977 --> 19:01.808
<i>and that makes me extremely happy.</i>

19:01.809 --> 19:03.678
Careful. Defiance is a drug.

19:03.679 --> 19:05.445
It can make you do stupid things.

19:05.446 --> 19:06.748
Yeah, like what?

19:07.172 --> 19:09.114
Like... burning your masters

19:09.560 --> 19:11.990
and walking away from a 6-figure contract.

19:12.292 --> 19:13.664
No, you didn't.

19:13.665 --> 19:16.578
Yep, I did, and that made me...

19:16.579 --> 19:18.602
<i>Extremely happy.</i>

19:18.603 --> 19:20.910
You know, I knew there was
a reason why I liked you.

19:20.911 --> 19:23.951
- Am I late?
- No, you're right on time. Grab a guitar.

19:23.952 --> 19:25.165
Here you go.

19:25.615 --> 19:26.721
Aw. (Chuckles)

19:27.352 --> 19:28.083
Thank you. (Amplifier feedback whines)

19:28.084 --> 19:29.988
(Clears throat) Okay, so
here's what I was thinking.

19:29.989 --> 19:32.106
Maybe I start out in
the audience with Olivia,

19:32.107 --> 19:34.628
you know, uh, just out there,
minding my own business,

19:34.629 --> 19:37.823
and then maybe I jump up for "Trouble Is."

19:37.824 --> 19:39.113
She's obsessed with that song.

19:39.114 --> 19:41.552
I think you should jump up
whenever you feel like it.

19:41.553 --> 19:44.960
My stage is your stage...
Literally... your stage.

19:45.911 --> 19:48.357
Well, your boyfriend's got
a little crush on my guitar.

19:48.358 --> 19:51.904
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.
He's just on the payroll.

19:53.755 --> 19:55.223
Oh, right. Yeah, those lines
always get a little blurry

19:55.224 --> 19:56.390
when money's involved.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.104
(Chuckles)

19:58.956 --> 20:00.322
Thanks for seeing me.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.258
This about Maddie?

20:02.259 --> 20:03.968
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, well, let me be clear.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.798
If you make any claim of paternity,

20:06.799 --> 20:08.673
I will do everything in
my power to stop you...

20:08.674 --> 20:10.633
Teddy, I'm here to tell you
that you're her father...

20:12.273 --> 20:13.728
Plain and simple.

20:14.167 --> 20:15.852
And you've been a good one.

20:15.853 --> 20:17.364
That's better than I ever could have done,

20:17.365 --> 20:21.096
that's for sure. I'm...
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

20:21.464 --> 20:23.332
Not built to be a father.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.364
I wish for her she'd
never found out about me.

20:25.804 --> 20:27.134
And I'm sorry for

20:27.481 --> 20:30.755
any harm I might have caused her or you.

20:31.609 --> 20:33.157
That's part of your 12-step program...

20:33.608 --> 20:35.132
Making amends, Deacon?

20:35.532 --> 20:38.751
Let me tell you something.
It's not that easy.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.430
'Cause unfortunately for all of us,

20:41.431 --> 20:43.140
she does know about you.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.895
And you know what? You
have a responsibility here

20:44.896 --> 20:46.349
whether I like it or not.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.619
Maddie is never gonna
stop watching you, Deacon.

20:49.620 --> 20:50.971
Never.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.987
And she's gonna take note
of every choice you make.

20:58.315 --> 20:59.979
I appreciate you seeing me.

21:01.964 --> 21:03.432
And, uh...

21:04.653 --> 21:07.419
I appreciate the choices
you made back then.

21:07.420 --> 21:09.362
A lesser man might've
done things differently.

21:09.883 --> 21:11.544
A lesser man did.

21:13.109 --> 21:14.824
(Huffs)

21:19.069 --> 21:20.478
(Door closes)

21:22.412 --> 21:23.844
<i>(Rayna and Liam) ♪ oh, oh, oh</i>

21:24.957 --> 21:27.157
<i>♪ oh, oh, oh, oh (Song ends)</i>

21:27.158 --> 21:29.821
- I forgot how amazing that was.
- I told ya.

21:30.619 --> 21:32.251
"Worlds Collide," the vocals...

21:32.252 --> 21:33.890
- What about 'em?
- I need a couple fixes.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.273
Okay.

21:36.274 --> 21:39.033
- What kind of fixes?
- Let's just re-record it.

21:39.034 --> 21:41.535
Well, uh, you know, I don't know.

21:41.536 --> 21:43.162
There are a couple of other
things I noticed... the, uh,

21:43.163 --> 21:45.309
the... that drum hit on "Hickory,"

21:45.310 --> 21:47.527
and the guitar solo in "You First"

21:47.528 --> 21:49.562
is a little bit busy for my taste.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.758
- I played that guitar solo.
- I know you did.

21:51.759 --> 21:54.368
- Don't get defensive.
- No, I'm not getting defensive.

21:54.369 --> 21:56.236
"Worlds Collide" needs a new vocal.

21:56.237 --> 21:58.147
And that's all.

21:58.148 --> 21:59.667
Trust me.

22:01.391 --> 22:03.791
- I trust you.
- Good.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.322
We'll book a studio for tomorrow

22:05.323 --> 22:06.512
and we'll lay down a new vocal.

22:06.513 --> 22:08.983
I can't do it tomorrow. (Tapes clattering)

22:08.984 --> 22:10.970
We'll do it the day after.

22:11.442 --> 22:13.443
I can't do it the day after.

22:13.806 --> 22:15.571
But you came to me all on fire

22:15.572 --> 22:17.702
because you wanted to
finish this thing, right?

22:19.149 --> 22:20.877
I can't sing.

22:31.029 --> 22:32.831
How bad is it?

22:32.832 --> 22:35.619
Basically my vocal cords just...

22:36.170 --> 22:39.037
You know, aren't the
same since the accident.

22:39.339 --> 22:40.651
Here's a tip. Don't ever let anybody

22:41.343 --> 22:44.467
stick a plastic tube down
your throat. (Snickers)

22:44.468 --> 22:47.030
- It's not funny.
- (Sighs) Oh, my God.

22:47.031 --> 22:49.460
Are they, you know, are your...

22:49.461 --> 22:51.724
Are your vocal cords ever gonna recover?

22:52.258 --> 22:53.674
I don't know.

22:53.675 --> 22:56.205
I-you know, I'm working
with this vocal therapist.

22:56.206 --> 22:57.858
And, you know, Jeff wants this album...

22:58.187 --> 22:59.888
Yesterday.

22:59.889 --> 23:02.346
- Oh, who cares what he wants?
- Yeah.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.123
Yeah, you know, if I think about it,

23:05.702 --> 23:08.167
if this is gonna be the
last album I ever do...

23:11.154 --> 23:13.802
I don't want him to own
it. I want to own it.

23:15.614 --> 23:18.768
Looks like I might have
to rethink that whole

23:18.769 --> 23:21.286
Edgehill exit strategy.

23:22.793 --> 23:25.712
Well, I can buy you some time.

23:25.713 --> 23:29.403
Bolster my reputation as
a pain-in-the-ass producer.

23:29.404 --> 23:31.624
I'll delay the hell out of it.

23:31.625 --> 23:33.452
Are you doing that for
me, or just 'cause you love

23:33.453 --> 23:35.250
to stick it to "the man"?

23:35.251 --> 23:39.854
No, I-I... I love the
album we made together.

23:39.855 --> 23:42.476
I love that you love the
album that we made together.

23:45.599 --> 23:48.016
Aren't you gonna ask me
what I want in return?

23:49.717 --> 23:51.970
I thought this was all about the music.

23:51.971 --> 23:53.241
Huh.

23:54.286 --> 23:56.525
No, I lied.

24:04.566 --> 24:06.095
(Deacon) Hey.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.927
(Bell tolling)

24:08.586 --> 24:10.281
You really leaving?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.613
Yeah, I am.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.083
Yeah, well...

24:14.979 --> 24:16.614
I just want to say thank you.

24:18.074 --> 24:19.505
And you were right.

24:19.506 --> 24:20.737
About?

24:21.047 --> 24:22.905
My not being able to run away from it...

24:24.567 --> 24:26.319
As much as I wanted to...

24:27.295 --> 24:29.354
As much as I still want to.

24:29.355 --> 24:31.537
You know, I prayed you'd come around.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.286
Yeah, well, no promises.

24:33.287 --> 24:34.962
Just... best effort.

24:37.178 --> 24:39.252
Not so much for me, but for her.

24:39.253 --> 24:41.449
And what "her" are we talking about?

24:41.450 --> 24:42.962
Maddie.

24:44.534 --> 24:47.042
Is this what happens when you
mix business with pleasure?

24:47.043 --> 24:49.638
(Chuckles) I told you I'm a great producer.

24:49.639 --> 24:51.187
Oh, my God. (Chuckles)

24:53.788 --> 24:55.449
So what happens now?

24:56.975 --> 24:58.598
We get back to work.

25:03.313 --> 25:06.546
Whoo! (Chuckles) Oh, damn!

25:06.547 --> 25:08.266
Man, you look beautiful.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.500
- You don't look half bad yourself.
- Oh, thank you.

25:11.157 --> 25:12.585
- You do look great.
- Thank you.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.086
Now eyes off, man. She's
my date. (Gunnar chuckles)

25:15.466 --> 25:18.715
- Here we go. Compliments of Edgehill.
- (Zoey) Thank you.

25:18.716 --> 25:19.482
(Door creaks open)

25:19.483 --> 25:20.719
(Door closes)

25:24.059 --> 25:25.296
Hi.

25:25.805 --> 25:27.216
Wow.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.187
I had no idea you could
look that good. (Chuckles)

25:31.581 --> 25:33.328
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

25:33.329 --> 25:34.536
Oh, it was supposed to be, yeah.

25:35.238 --> 25:36.892
Thanks. (Chuckles)

25:37.279 --> 25:39.130
(Cheers and applause)

25:39.131 --> 25:41.736
(Juliette, amplified voice) Now I would
love to bring up a very special guest.

25:42.350 --> 25:46.446
Y'all give it up
Mr. Charles "hot licks" Wentworth!

25:46.447 --> 25:49.539

28:58.946 --> 29:00.626
Well, for somebody who hates "the man,"

29:00.627 --> 29:02.354
you sure are good at pressing the flesh.

29:02.355 --> 29:04.159
- Necessary evil.
- Speaking of...

29:04.160 --> 29:05.313
- Hey!
- Hey!

29:05.314 --> 29:07.705
- Hey!
- So... how's the dynamic duo?

- (Rayna clicks tongue)
- (Jeff) Good?

29:09.229 --> 29:10.405
- Great.
- (Jeff chuckles)

29:10.893 --> 29:12.596
You got an E.T.A. on our album?

29:12.597 --> 29:14.800
It can't be rushed. I
don't know what to tell you.

29:14.801 --> 29:16.104
This man is a genius.

29:16.105 --> 29:18.246
- I-I'm at his mercy.
- All right. Okay.

29:18.247 --> 29:19.801
Look, I-no, I-I'm
just... I'm excited,

29:20.138 --> 29:23.018
that's all... for your
album and to hear you sing.

29:23.019 --> 29:25.469
It's gonna be great. And, uh,

29:25.470 --> 29:27.368
by the way, I-I just want
to thank you in advance

29:27.369 --> 29:28.852
for making my night tonight.

29:29.669 --> 29:30.949

29:31.275 --> 29:32.689
<i>I thought you were gonna make my night.</i>

29:33.886 --> 29:35.908
I already made your afternoon.

29:37.432 --> 29:40.477
(Deacon sighs) I really appreciate you
coming in late like this for me.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.243
Well, when you told me
you cut off your own cast,

29:42.244 --> 29:43.677
you didn't leave me much choice.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.953
- On a scale from one to...
- (Strained voice) Ten.

29:46.459 --> 29:47.857
You know, if you had come in any sooner,

29:47.858 --> 29:48.861
I could have given you something

29:48.862 --> 29:50.815
- to help manage the pain.
- (Grunts) Yeah, well...

29:51.910 --> 29:53.767
I wasn't sure I could manage that.

29:54.126 --> 29:58.085
I thought I could just push
past the pain on my own,

29:58.086 --> 30:00.248
but obviously that's not working.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.319
I understand.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.376
You're still offering
me help, I'll take it.

30:04.377 --> 30:08.292
(Cheers and applause) (Amplified voice)
Thank you, thank you so much!

30:17.202 --> 30:18.648

Man, I can't believe I'm
here. Somebody oughta pinch me.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.433
(Woman in audience) Oh, I will!

30:34.434 --> 30:36.017
(Laughs)

30:36.018 --> 30:37.827
Thank you, darlin'. I was thinking about

30:37.828 --> 30:39.342
what song I wanted to perform for y'all.

30:39.343 --> 30:40.556
I want to do something special.

30:40.557 --> 30:42.646
So... I hope you enjoy this song

- Nothin'.

32:16.266 --> 32:18.161
Just go to the party. I got work to do.

32:18.889 --> 32:20.986
Wait, don't tell me
you're actually pissed off

32:20.987 --> 32:22.906
that I let Charlie play with us.

32:22.907 --> 32:24.093
He paid for this whole thing.

32:24.094 --> 32:25.529
What else was I supposed to do?

32:25.530 --> 32:26.824
(Chuckles) You think I give a damn about

32:26.825 --> 32:28.318
that guy playing guitar?

32:29.071 --> 32:31.474
I came here because I
thought we were friends.

32:32.021 --> 32:34.160
So imagine my surprise to find out that

32:34.161 --> 32:36.144
I'm just another guy on the payroll.

32:40.927 --> 32:43.762
<i>You are just way too sensitive.</i>

32:43.763 --> 32:45.095
- Yeah, that's right.
- You are.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.693
I am. Yeah, put it on me. I'm the problem.

32:47.694 --> 32:49.399
I mean it couldn't possibly be your fault

32:49.400 --> 32:50.684
that you don't trust anybody enough

32:50.685 --> 32:52.257
to actually be your friend.

32:52.258 --> 32:54.489
- That is enough.
- No, it's the truth.

32:54.490 --> 32:55.877
And you know it.

32:56.210 --> 32:59.257
The sad thing is, it's your choice.

32:59.258 --> 33:01.172
<i>You choose to live this way...</i>

33:01.173 --> 33:03.825

33:03.826 --> 33:05.282
- or anything but yourself.
- Fine.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.483
But if you are not gonna stop talking,

33:07.484 --> 33:09.086
then you are fired!

33:13.875 --> 33:15.996
Well, I guess that proves it.

33:18.184 --> 33:19.701
I really was just the hired help.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.207
Wasn't I?

33:26.791 --> 33:29.178

33:30.147 --> 33:32.005

34:04.818 --> 34:06.670
I-I know that a few of
you might be aware that

34:06.671 --> 34:09.237
I'm starting my own
label... Highway 65 records.

34:09.627 --> 34:12.112

34:12.659 --> 34:14.286

and I hope that y'all are
gonna be excited about it, too.

34:16.715 --> 34:19.280
And so as a very special
treat, I want to introduce

34:19.844 --> 34:21.485
a young girl I found

34:21.487 --> 34:23.969
who is such an incredible talent,

34:23.969 --> 34:27.541
that I wanted her to
be my very first artist

34:27.542 --> 34:29.362
on Highway 65.

34:29.364 --> 34:32.253
So would you please help me
to welcome up to the stage

34:32.254 --> 34:34.129

I've been thinking about this time

36:05.740 --> 36:07.526
when I was 10 years old. And, uh...

36:08.533 --> 36:10.338
It wasn't the first time.
It wasn't the last time.

36:10.339 --> 36:12.225
Just... just...

36:12.226 --> 36:13.831
The time I remember the most.

36:15.409 --> 36:17.123
My father was a drunk.

36:18.747 --> 36:20.342
He was a mean one.

36:20.343 --> 36:22.928
And, uh, this particular night,

36:22.929 --> 36:25.341
we were lucky enough to
have him home for dinner,

36:25.342 --> 36:26.867
which was, uh...

36:28.394 --> 36:29.769
I don't know, what do you call it?

36:29.770 --> 36:33.588
Um... some kind of casserole
or something, you know.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.971
Whatever it was, I guess
he didn't care much for it

36:36.972 --> 36:38.493
'cause he, uh...

36:41.801 --> 36:43.687
He threw it at my mother. Right...

36:44.579 --> 36:46.109
Threw it in her face.

36:46.774 --> 36:48.360
She screamed, you know, like...

36:48.744 --> 36:50.467
Like you would.

36:50.468 --> 36:52.609
But that just made him angrier. So, uh...

36:59.382 --> 37:01.274
He broke her nose.

37:02.459 --> 37:03.968
I got a sister that's
a little older than me...

37:03.969 --> 37:05.267
She jumped up in between 'em,

37:05.268 --> 37:06.378
and she started fighting him off,

37:06.379 --> 37:08.330
trying to protect my...

37:08.999 --> 37:10.218
(Inhales deeply)

37:11.222 --> 37:12.842
(Voice breaking) Anyway,
he took off his belt,

37:13.277 --> 37:14.842
and, uh...

37:18.275 --> 37:19.935
He started just whippin' her.

37:20.397 --> 37:23.121
And my sister's crying, and my mom's, uh,

37:23.122 --> 37:25.162
screaming at my dad. She's screaming,

37:25.163 --> 37:26.937
"is that what you want your son to see?"

37:26.938 --> 37:28.795
And my daddy... He just looked over at me,

37:28.796 --> 37:30.359
and he said, uh,

37:30.360 --> 37:32.640
"when you're a man, you
gon' be just like me."

37:33.668 --> 37:35.206

37:39.627 --> 37:42.103
(Exhales deeply and whispers) Here I am.

37:43.324 --> 37:44.846
I'm a drunk.

37:47.169 --> 37:48.806
Just like him.

37:49.543 --> 37:51.314
And I hurt people I love...

37:51.821 --> 37:53.386
(Voice breaking) Just like him.

37:54.515 --> 37:55.942
But I'll tell you something.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.687
I ain't never hurt a child.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.439

38:15.138 --> 38:17.203
(Man) Thank you, Deacon. (Exhales deeply)

38:17.204 --> 38:18.520
Are you happy?

38:22.143 --> 38:24.624
Uh, folks, I suggest that
maybe we take a little break.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.541
I'm proud of you.

38:27.542 --> 38:28.895
There he is, ladies and gentlemen,

38:35.294 --> 38:36.641
Hey. Hi! (Giggles)

38:37.100 --> 38:38.771
- You killed it up there.
- Oh, thank you.

38:38.772 --> 38:40.879
I thought I was gonna
fall out of this thing.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.500
Well, you didn't. I
probably woulda noticed.

38:42.501 --> 38:45.991
Oh. (Chuckles) Your song was really great.

38:46.531 --> 38:49.122
Will sure, uh, he sure owned it, didn't he?

38:49.123 --> 38:50.565
- Yeah. (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

38:51.557 --> 38:52.792
What?

38:52.793 --> 38:55.819
Oh, nothing. It's just watching
you both performing up there,

39:22.817 --> 39:27.015
<i>♪ But maybe your head is
not where your heart is ♪</i>

39:27.016 --> 39:29.347
There's a lot of things I'm
not sure about these days.

39:31.799 --> 39:33.950
One thing I am sure about is...

39:34.449 --> 39:36.974
I'm not one who runs away
from his responsibilities.

39:37.567 --> 39:41.004
(Sighs), You know, even though my
marriage failed, I... (Cup thuds)

39:42.050 --> 39:44.061
I've always tried to be a good father.

39:44.893 --> 39:46.076
And that's why I'm struggling

39:46.077 --> 39:47.721
with how you and I should do this.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.729
I just don't want this child

39:50.137 --> 39:52.973
to grow up without a father
and not be a part of my life.

39:54.665 --> 39:56.484
So where does that leave us?

39:56.837 --> 39:58.695
(Sighs) I'm not really sure, to be honest.

40:01.212 --> 40:03.832
And I know you and I had something once.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.761
(Whispers) We still can.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.304
I know it.

40:12.753 --> 40:16.524
<i>(Jared & the mill) ♪ all we had
to a night that we attacked ♪</i>

40:17.132 --> 40:19.744
You look like you're having
as good a time as I am.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.747
Turns out they're both lousy dates.

40:23.739 --> 40:25.495
You wanna get the hell outta here?

40:26.850 --> 40:29.165
I'd say that's the best
offer I'd had all night.

40:31.046 --> 40:33.561
All right, here's to you
for talking up your label

40:33.562 --> 40:35.387
- and keeping your secret safe.
- Hmm.

40:35.805 --> 40:37.822
(Clinks) Here's to killing
two birds with one stone.

40:39.509 --> 40:41.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.555
Hey.
You mind if I have a word with my artist?

40:43.556 --> 40:45.737
Um, I don't, if she doesn't.

40:45.738 --> 40:47.726
- I'll find you in a minute.
- All right.

40:50.017 --> 40:51.860
You embarrassed me in
front of my stockholders.

40:52.354 --> 40:53.947
Well, I showed up.

40:53.948 --> 40:55.396
I took the stage.

40:55.966 --> 40:58.564
What's good for Highway
65 is good for Edgehill.

40:59.271 --> 41:01.308
"It's all about the future,"
isn't that what you said?

41:03.403 --> 41:05.640
So this is all about Will
going to Edgehill, huh?

41:07.482 --> 41:09.305
You know, if I had a suspicious nature,

41:09.955 --> 41:11.725
I'd think there was more to it than that.

41:12.978 --> 41:14.628
Oh, wait...

41:15.508 --> 41:17.345
I do have a suspicious nature.

41:23.804 --> 41:25.377
(Humming)

41:25.378 --> 41:27.002
- Whoa! Ho-ho-ho!
- Oh, sorry!

41:27.003 --> 41:28.167
- Sorry.
- Watch out.

41:28.168 --> 41:30.284
I have been going around
in circles for about

41:30.824 --> 41:32.815
the last 20 minutes trying to find my room.

41:32.816 --> 41:34.491
All right. Well, it's just
down there on the right.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.251
May I escort you?

41:37.190 --> 41:38.733
Is it a rough neighborhood?

41:38.734 --> 41:41.007
- Yeah, it's really rough.
- Oh. Okay.

41:41.377 --> 41:42.918
I'm actually glad I bumped into you.

41:42.919 --> 41:44.854
I just wanted to, uh, thank you again

41:44.855 --> 41:46.427
for letting me play tonight.

41:46.428 --> 41:47.764
No, it was my pleasure.

41:47.765 --> 41:50.529
You're actually not as
bad as you think you are.

41:51.048 --> 41:52.654
(Door handle clicks) Seriously?

41:53.023 --> 41:54.355
Seriously.

41:54.356 --> 41:55.598
Scale of one to ten.

41:55.950 --> 41:57.355
Uh... guitar player?

41:58.502 --> 41:59.807
Six.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.354
But husband?

42:01.968 --> 42:03.784
Definitely a ten.

42:03.785 --> 42:05.907
Olivia is a very lucky lady.

42:05.908 --> 42:07.233
Mm-hmm?

42:10.160 --> 42:11.847
(Whispers) What are you doing?

42:11.848 --> 42:13.087
What?

42:13.088 --> 42:15.573
- You have a wife!
- Yeah, and you have a boyfriend.

42:16.143 --> 42:17.873
He is not my boyfriend.

42:17.874 --> 42:19.812
And... frankly, at this point,

42:19.813 --> 42:21.302
I don't even know that we're friends.

42:21.303 --> 42:25.427
Apparently, I like to be
"unattached" and "unavailable."

42:25.428 --> 42:26.939
Right.
Well, there's something we have in common.

42:27.361 --> 42:29.516
I'm about as "unavailable" as you can get.
