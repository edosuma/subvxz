00:16.541 --> 00:17.974
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.339
It's a jungle out there.

00:54.581 --> 00:56.921
Ecstasy was the magic pill.

00:56.956 --> 00:59.308
It had the power
to make everyone rich.

00:59.343 --> 01:01.626
Every punk on the street
was a dealer.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.506
Every nightclub bouncer
thought he was Mr Big.

01:04.541 --> 01:07.817
And Jason Moran, he thought
he was the king of them all.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.261
But he had no idea
there was another would-be king

01:12.296 --> 01:14.377
working away secretly
to dethrone him.

01:16.061 --> 01:19.661
I'm gonna be a bloke
that makes so much dough,

01:19.696 --> 01:23.893
I can buy a chick like you
whatever she wants.

01:27.861 --> 01:29.797
I'm doing me own presses, Roberta.

01:29.832 --> 01:31.734
Using the Morans' rig?

01:32.941 --> 01:35.375
You fuckin' little hooter.

01:36.861 --> 01:39.981
Carl Williams,
you don't look like much,

01:40.016 --> 01:41.781
but you've got balls, haven't you?

01:50.381 --> 01:53.701
Hey, mate. How's it hanging?
Kinda busy, actually, Rich.

01:53.736 --> 01:55.146
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:55.181 --> 01:57.821
Well, why don't you give us a cut
and I'll help youse out?

01:57.856 --> 02:01.021
No, no, she's right.
Oh, come on, mate.

02:01.056 --> 02:02.454
Hey, Bruno.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.306
How are you going?

02:10.341 --> 02:12.941
Mate, on Wednesday
I left 550 pills here, yeah?

02:12.976 --> 02:13.906
Right.

02:13.941 --> 02:15.621
You were gonna sell them for $23.
Hmm.

02:15.656 --> 02:17.266
Three bucks a pill
for your commission.

02:17.301 --> 02:19.386
And I'm here to collect
the other $20, right?

02:19.421 --> 02:23.301
It's 20 bucks a pill. Do the maths, right?
I done the maths.

02:23.336 --> 02:25.426
Dino, no-one's buying, mate.

02:25.461 --> 02:28.221
Why not? What are you telling 'em?
Mate, I'm telling 'em the price.

02:28.256 --> 02:30.141
Listen, at $23,
you're out of the game.

02:30.176 --> 02:31.369
That's crap.

02:32.621 --> 02:34.621
Dino, the streets are full
of some other shit, mate,

02:34.656 --> 02:36.066
going for 12 bucks.

02:36.101 --> 02:38.421
You know, personally, mate,
there's nothing I can do, mate.

02:38.456 --> 02:40.421
Do you think I'm gonna
let you pocket the lot?

02:40.456 --> 02:42.741
There's fucking nothing to pocket.

02:42.776 --> 02:43.706
Are you serious?

02:43.741 --> 02:45.461
11 grand, Bruno.
It's mine. I need it.

02:45.496 --> 02:46.894
Don't fucking dog on me.

02:49.501 --> 02:51.281
Don't you call me a dog.

02:51.316 --> 02:52.888
I'm not a dog.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.426
Understand?

02:54.461 --> 02:55.894
I'm not a fuckin' dog.

03:01.741 --> 03:02.696
Hey!

03:23.941 --> 03:25.941
So, you and Bruno
worked together a lot?

03:25.976 --> 03:27.386
Sure.

03:27.421 --> 03:29.651
Tonight both you guys were
on the door from what time?

03:30.861 --> 03:32.294
Since about eight, probably.

03:33.341 --> 03:35.261
So, did he seem nervous to you?
Anxious?

03:35.296 --> 03:36.706
Nah.

03:36.741 --> 03:39.414
Was he in any trouble
or get into any fights lately?

03:40.661 --> 03:42.094
Not that I recall.

03:43.141 --> 03:44.741
Well, you're sort of
right next to him

03:44.776 --> 03:46.421
pretty much all the time, yeah?

03:46.456 --> 03:48.426
Oh, yeah. If you say so.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.981
It's not if I say so.
You're the one who said so.

03:51.016 --> 03:52.414
Yeah, if you say so.

03:53.741 --> 03:55.174
Is he gonna pull through?

03:58.541 --> 03:59.986
Look, Willie,

04:00.021 --> 04:02.781
come on, mate, just give me
a description of who was involved here.

04:02.816 --> 04:06.421
Look, mate, I wish I could help,
but I can't.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.538
Hey, bozo, where is it?

04:08.573 --> 04:10.586
Excuse me, sir.
I dunno.

04:10.621 --> 04:11.626
What do you mean, "You don't know"?

04:11.661 --> 04:14.301
You said you'd keep an eye on it.
It was 15 metres away.

04:14.336 --> 04:15.838
Sir, I said excuse me.

04:15.873 --> 04:17.305
Look, about an hour ago,

04:17.341 --> 04:21.500
I parked a blue XK8 Jaguar
convertible right there.

04:21.536 --> 04:24.226
It's a $200,000 car.

04:24.261 --> 04:29.858
Oh, I love Jaguars.
Oh, I just love Jaguars.

04:50.901 --> 04:53.256
Do you wanna go home or come inside?

04:54.941 --> 04:58.138
Can I come inside?
Can I?

04:59.541 --> 05:01.586
We're at your house, dummy.

05:01.621 --> 05:05.136
No, no. I mean, if I could find
a big enough condom somewhere.

05:06.581 --> 05:09.266
Um... yeah, OK.

05:09.301 --> 05:14.541
I mean, I don't normally do this,
but it's just been a weird night.

05:14.576 --> 05:16.906
Look, no pressure.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.693
If you don't want to, that's fine.

05:20.541 --> 05:25.581
You know, while you were gone,
when you were getting the car,

05:25.616 --> 05:28.513
I was waiting
outside the restaurant,

05:28.548 --> 05:31.411
thinking, I don't even know
what you do.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.146
I'm a used car dealer.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.978
How else am I gonna get
wheels like this?

05:39.141 --> 05:40.586
So, what do you want?

05:40.621 --> 05:44.375
Want me to take you home
or take you to heaven?

05:49.501 --> 05:53.466
Bruno Berlozzi,
he's a nightclub bouncer.

05:53.501 --> 05:56.941
He was shot to the cheek, lodged
in his brain, took one in the shoulder.

05:56.976 --> 05:59.781
So, he's unconscious but alive?
Yeah.

05:59.816 --> 06:01.226
Can't help you, then.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.781
Yeah, well, look, there's a chance
he may croak this afternoon,

06:03.816 --> 06:05.586
in which case
we'll have to call you anyway...

06:05.621 --> 06:08.186
Yeah, but I don't work for
the nearly-Homicide Squad.

06:08.221 --> 06:11.261
So, until he's actually dead,
it's your investigation, not ours.

06:11.296 --> 06:12.941
Who's top of your list?

06:12.976 --> 06:14.466
Well, Jason Moran.

06:14.501 --> 06:16.701
Any particular reason
or just because?

06:16.736 --> 06:18.666
Well, he was at the club.

06:18.701 --> 06:21.221
Does he have a motive?
Well, does he ever?

06:21.256 --> 06:22.666
Look at this, will ya?

06:22.701 --> 06:26.541
Now, somebody's opened
their car door onto this vehicle,

06:26.576 --> 06:27.986
chipped the duco.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.297
They don't bother reporting it.
This is how rust starts.

06:33.581 --> 06:35.026
Any security camera footage?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.321
Yeah, there's some, but nothing
that shows the shooter, though.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.581
There's a few blokes milling around,
but no-one we recognise.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.014
Try the Drug Squad.

06:42.061 --> 06:45.141
Steve Owen was still
a general dogsbody detective,

06:45.176 --> 06:47.141
but he was busting
to get into the big league

06:47.176 --> 06:49.018
and mix it with the gangsters.

06:50.101 --> 06:52.501
When's Jason's trial
for that King Street thing?

06:52.536 --> 06:54.298
Eight, nine weeks away.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.021
Yes, we don't think
he'll get out of it.

06:58.056 --> 07:00.426
I'm sure he thinks he can.
OK, here we go.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.658
So this is the camera angle
from outside the club.

07:04.741 --> 07:07.346
And there's Bruno
about to leave the frame.

07:07.381 --> 07:09.781
I'm assuming he's going over the road
to argue with the shooter -

07:09.816 --> 07:10.986
who we never see.

07:11.021 --> 07:12.773
And there's Willie Thompson.

07:13.821 --> 07:16.335
I guess they're both dealers.

07:17.901 --> 07:19.386
Well, they are associates of people

07:19.421 --> 07:21.181
known to be in
the amphetamine business.

07:21.216 --> 07:23.701
But how much they actually deal...

07:23.736 --> 07:25.506
Right.

07:25.541 --> 07:27.906
OK, so Bruno's shot there.

07:27.941 --> 07:30.081
And there's Willie,
the other bouncer,

07:30.116 --> 07:32.186
who claims
he didn't see anything.

07:32.221 --> 07:34.897
And this other bloke,
here in the hood,

07:34.932 --> 07:37.573
who just seems to be
hanging around Willie.

07:39.141 --> 07:40.574
What do you think?

07:41.621 --> 07:43.691
It's Richard.
Richard?

07:44.741 --> 07:46.174
Right. So who's Richard?

07:52.181 --> 07:55.186
Freeze. This is a raid.

07:55.221 --> 07:57.401
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.581
Freeze, freeze.
Hold your fire.

07:59.616 --> 08:01.061
What the hell are you doing?

08:01.096 --> 08:03.146
It's 'Star Wars'.

08:03.181 --> 08:04.861
The force was with me.

08:04.896 --> 08:05.866
Get it?

08:05.901 --> 08:09.141
We've got 200 rounds of ammo pointed
at you, and you pretend to attack us.

08:09.176 --> 08:12.061
You should have
seen your face, but!

08:12.096 --> 08:13.494
Oh, what's this, Rich?

08:14.541 --> 08:16.506
I don't know, Your Honour.

08:16.541 --> 08:18.706
I was in there
digesting some literature,

08:18.741 --> 08:21.826
and these gentlemen come in
and knocked me door down.

08:21.861 --> 08:24.661
Then I come in here and there's
all this stuff I've never seen before.

08:24.696 --> 08:26.094
God's honour.

08:27.301 --> 08:30.081
You blokes are out and out
goat rootin' bastards.

08:30.116 --> 08:32.861
You're on the Moran payroll,
aren't ya? And Mokbel's.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.426
What? And they can do
whatever they like?

08:34.461 --> 08:37.181
But you come in here.
You frame up a hard worker...

08:37.216 --> 08:39.900
Where were you last night, Rich,
around midnight?

08:39.936 --> 08:40.866
Out of it.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.461
Sin City nightclub, maybe?

08:42.496 --> 08:43.986
I wouldn't have a clue.

08:44.020 --> 08:46.501
I met Mark Moran
down the Prince around seven...

08:46.536 --> 08:48.781
Someone shot Bruno
right in front of you.

08:48.816 --> 08:50.226
Well, I categorically deny that.

08:50.261 --> 08:52.501
We've got you on video, mate.
We know you were there.

08:52.536 --> 08:54.861
Bullshit.
Wouldn't look anything like me.

08:54.896 --> 08:56.918
Actually, it does, Mr Mladenich.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.906
Nothing a haircut wouldn't fix.

08:58.941 --> 09:00.481
What, did you choose
that tie yourself?

09:00.516 --> 09:01.986
You've got a new girlfriend,
have you?

09:02.021 --> 09:04.866
Rich, mate, why don't you
just give us a name, huh?

09:04.901 --> 09:08.894
You're on parole, mate. And we've got
you for possession. So be sensible.

09:10.581 --> 09:12.890
OK. Yeah, alright.

09:14.541 --> 09:17.374
I'll give youse a name if youse
promise to leave me out of it.

09:18.421 --> 09:19.854
What is it?

09:23.861 --> 09:25.294
Elmer Fudd.

09:33.141 --> 09:34.574
Thanks.
Sorry.

09:54.701 --> 09:57.181
You must be Rocco.
Yep.

09:57.216 --> 09:58.901
I'm Shelley.

09:58.936 --> 10:00.220
Hi.

10:01.261 --> 10:02.706
OK.

10:02.741 --> 10:04.901
Well, I guess I'll see you later.

10:04.936 --> 10:06.334
'Bye, Dino.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.134
Yeah, whatever.

10:13.301 --> 10:14.734
Where did you get the car?

10:17.901 --> 10:19.346
Bullshit!

10:19.381 --> 10:21.186
Hey, call her up, if you like.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.781
You screwed that chick nine times
in one night?

10:23.816 --> 10:25.214
It'd fall off, wouldn't it?

10:26.501 --> 10:29.493
Amyl nitrite and Viagra, mate.
Bloody wonder drugs.

10:38.101 --> 10:39.701
Any news on Bruno?

10:39.736 --> 10:41.266
Nothing... yet.

10:41.301 --> 10:43.701
Except he wasn't bullshitting.
Yeah.

10:43.736 --> 10:45.146
I thought he was, you know.

10:45.181 --> 10:47.421
I thought he'd sold the lot
and just taken the cash.

10:47.456 --> 10:48.866
The word is, he hadn't.

10:48.901 --> 10:50.741
There's a lot of cheap shit
on the market.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.174
That's why our stuff isn't moving.

11:06.701 --> 11:09.773
Maybe it's not about drugs at all.

11:11.941 --> 11:13.386
Do you reckon?

11:13.421 --> 11:16.361
It could be another
standover thing.

11:16.396 --> 11:19.301
Or a car stealing racket
or something.

11:24.301 --> 11:25.734
Yeah? Owen.

11:27.101 --> 11:28.898
Yes, mate. No, that's great.

11:29.941 --> 11:31.421
No, do not approach anyone, OK?

11:31.456 --> 11:32.866
They've found the Jag.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.861
Listen, I'm gonna
try and get permission

11:34.896 --> 11:37.101
to get a listening device put in it.

11:37.136 --> 11:38.906
Just follow it for a while.

11:38.941 --> 11:42.501
Whoever's got it could be linked
to an attempted murder, OK?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.866
Good on you, Ben. Thanks, mate.

11:44.901 --> 11:47.290
Bruno Berlozzi died
about an hour ago.

11:48.621 --> 11:49.895
So, he's dead?

11:51.501 --> 11:52.934
Boohoo.

11:53.981 --> 11:57.301
Bastard. Hardly sold
a bloody pill all weekend.

11:57.336 --> 11:58.746
We know why, though.

11:58.781 --> 12:00.386
So, someone's undercutting us.
So what?

12:00.421 --> 12:02.786
Isn't there an endless demand
for this stuff, huh?

12:02.821 --> 12:05.221
Tell me I'm not going
fuckin' crazy in the head here, yeah?

12:05.256 --> 12:06.666
I mean, that was the whole point.

12:06.701 --> 12:09.420
That's the reason we forked out,
what, 80 grand for a press, yeah?

12:11.821 --> 12:13.861
Back in an hour or so, OK?
Yeah.

12:13.896 --> 12:15.866
Keep an eye on the kids?
What?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.106
Your children - they're inside.
They're about this big.

12:18.141 --> 12:21.341
Can you keep an eye on them?
Yeah, they're fine. Just piss off.

12:21.376 --> 12:23.826
Where were we?
Cheap eckies.

12:23.861 --> 12:26.101
We charge $25 for ours,
the cheapies are going for $12.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.575
What would you buy?

12:27.610 --> 12:29.014
Well, who was it?

12:30.661 --> 12:31.696
Mokbel?

12:34.461 --> 12:36.053
Or the bikies.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.541
Or Radev.

12:40.941 --> 12:42.426
Who knows?

12:42.461 --> 12:43.894
Who shot Bruno?

12:44.941 --> 12:47.216
Mladenich saw it but he's
not telling anyone, either.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.821
So, these cheapies, anyway,
I mean, whoever's doing it,

12:50.856 --> 12:53.141
do you think they're trying
to seriously take us on?

12:53.176 --> 12:54.666
Is that what it's about?

12:54.701 --> 12:56.453
Whoever it is,
it doesn't really matter.

12:57.501 --> 12:59.401
Just gonna have to sort 'em out, hmm?

12:59.436 --> 13:01.648
How we handle it
depends on who it is.

13:01.683 --> 13:03.861
I don't give a fuck who it is. Huh?

13:03.896 --> 13:05.786
This is costing us a fortune.

13:05.821 --> 13:07.821
I've got a family to think about,
for Christ's sake.

13:07.856 --> 13:10.266
And this fuck... this fucker...

13:10.301 --> 13:12.735
<i>... is takin' our fucking cash - fuck!</i>

13:14.301 --> 13:15.757
Calm down.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.214
Alright?

13:18.501 --> 13:20.571
Cheap shit car, fuck.

13:26.301 --> 13:28.226
Rocco, this is Nik Radev.

13:28.261 --> 13:31.094
Nik, Rocco Arico,
a good mate of mine.

13:32.701 --> 13:34.134
Are you taking us down, Nik?

13:35.181 --> 13:36.626
Are you taking me down?

13:36.661 --> 13:38.901
We should have picked up
10 or 11 grand last night.

13:38.936 --> 13:41.106
Do you think if I cleaned up
I'd be standing here?

13:41.141 --> 13:44.661
Maybe. It's just like you to make
a shitload of cut-price tabs.

13:44.696 --> 13:46.106
Blame everyone else.

13:46.141 --> 13:48.821
Cut the crap. It's either you
or the Morans or Mokbel.

13:48.856 --> 13:51.501
No-one else is making eckies
in any sort of volume, right?

13:51.536 --> 13:53.266
You call me liar?

13:53.301 --> 13:55.426
All I'm saying is some rat,
somewhere,

13:55.461 --> 13:58.221
is making all the fucking money,
and we're starving.

13:58.256 --> 14:00.221
Do I look like I'm smiling to you?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.866
I dropped three times that.

14:01.901 --> 14:04.779
We dropped 11 fucking grand last night
and we're up the shit creek.

14:06.261 --> 14:08.501
If you're the one that's been
putting all this cheap shit...

14:08.536 --> 14:12.130
Hey... I don't rip anyone off, Dino.

14:13.821 --> 14:18.451
And if you repeat that again...
I'll kill you.

14:20.301 --> 14:21.814
And you, monkey.

14:39.501 --> 14:41.253
$2,000 - that was the deal, right?

14:42.501 --> 14:43.934
You heard about Bruno?

14:45.901 --> 14:47.334
It's getting too hot, Carl.

14:48.381 --> 14:51.061
I'll go through with what we agreed,
but I'm out after this.

14:51.096 --> 14:52.972
OK. Thanks, Willie.

15:00.541 --> 15:03.426
This is unbelievable.

15:03.461 --> 15:05.466
Wanna slow down a bit
from now on, though.

15:05.501 --> 15:08.581
Nuh. Nuh, we're on our way, Carl.
The horse has bolted.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.781
You got the money.
And this buys you control, see?

15:10.816 --> 15:12.226
You control people with money.

15:12.261 --> 15:14.059
It's how the whole world
fucking works.

15:14.094 --> 15:15.857
And look how much
you just got yourself.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.061
I am gonna love... livin' with you.

15:22.096 --> 15:23.494
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:25.221 --> 15:26.654
Have you told Dean about us yet?

15:27.701 --> 15:29.851
Oh, fuck. I knew it was something.

15:36.181 --> 15:38.181
Oh, and remember
he's a mate of Jason's, yeah?

15:38.216 --> 15:39.626
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:39.661 --> 15:41.261
So don't piss him off too much,
alright?

15:41.296 --> 15:42.694
Yeah.
Alright?

15:46.701 --> 15:48.134
Hi, honey. It's me.

15:49.461 --> 15:51.701
No, I'm with Carl Williams.

15:51.736 --> 15:54.386
No, CARL Williams.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.252
He used to go out with
Trisha Moran's sister.

15:57.501 --> 16:01.289
Yeah, that one.
Look... I want a divorce, OK?

16:02.901 --> 16:05.506
Yeah, 'cause... he's a great root

16:05.541 --> 16:07.541
and you and I just aren't
in love anymore, yeah?

16:07.576 --> 16:08.974
Do you want me to go on?

16:10.101 --> 16:11.546
No.

16:11.581 --> 16:13.901
Well, why? No, why start talking now?

16:13.936 --> 16:15.466
What's the point?

16:15.501 --> 16:19.941
No, Dean, it's too late.
It's too fucking late, alright?

16:21.941 --> 16:23.386
Yeah.

16:23.421 --> 16:24.940
Hey, are you alright?
Yeah.

16:24.975 --> 16:26.459
You did that for me?
Yeah.

16:27.501 --> 16:29.506
It'll be alright now, OK?
Prick.

16:29.541 --> 16:31.781
Just you and me.
You don't need to worry about him.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.266
Yeah. Love you.

16:33.301 --> 16:34.826
So, to summarise,

16:34.861 --> 16:37.266
Homicide has now inherited
an investigation

16:37.301 --> 16:39.781
where we have no firm idea
who did the actual shooting,

16:39.816 --> 16:41.226
nor what it was all about.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.306
And neither Thompson nor Mladenich
can recall anything.

16:44.341 --> 16:48.101
On the one hand, Jason was there -
known to be an unpredictable thug.

16:48.136 --> 16:51.861
On the other hand, Rocco and Dino
are now driving around in a car

16:51.896 --> 16:53.306
stolen from the crime scene.

16:53.341 --> 16:55.141
Which could have been stolen
an hour before.

16:55.176 --> 16:56.266
Possibly.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.781
You won't get anywhere
without surveillance.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.386
Yes, but surveillance on whom?

16:59.421 --> 17:01.466
We haven't got the manpower
to put it on everybody.

17:01.501 --> 17:04.300
Well, Dino's got the car.
Yeah, but Jason's got the form.

17:04.336 --> 17:05.746
What about the Drug Squad?

17:05.781 --> 17:08.181
Have they got any theories on
what this might be all about?

17:08.215 --> 17:09.661
If they do,
they're not sharing them.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.378
And that'd be right.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.021
Well, if we are gonna let Dino and
Rocco drive around in a stolen Jag,

17:16.056 --> 17:17.861
we have to apply
to get surveillance on them.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.417
It's the only way I can justify it.

17:19.453 --> 17:20.906
And we have to be bloody careful.

17:20.941 --> 17:23.057
And it can't go on for too long.
Alright?

17:27.540 --> 17:28.974
Steve, have you got a minute?
Yep.

17:31.741 --> 17:35.661
Someone has suggested
that you come over to Homicide

17:35.696 --> 17:37.516
and do temps for a few months.

17:37.551 --> 17:39.336
Are you interested?
Yeah, sure.

17:40.381 --> 17:42.212
I mean, yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

17:43.541 --> 17:44.894
Very good.

17:48.061 --> 17:49.494
You little beauty.

17:51.941 --> 17:53.386
You bloody knew.

17:53.421 --> 17:56.060
Well... someone had to suggest it.

17:59.341 --> 18:01.861
Some people just know
when they've found their niche.

18:01.896 --> 18:05.101
Still make mistakes, of course,
but the job suits them.

18:05.136 --> 18:07.456
And Steve was finally
where he belonged.

18:16.741 --> 18:18.186
Mario.

18:18.221 --> 18:20.416
Hey, Lewis. Hey.

18:22.421 --> 18:23.866
Do you know where Mick is?

18:23.901 --> 18:26.461
Ah, Mick is out and about.
What? Did you want a word?

18:26.496 --> 18:28.986
No, no. Just the boys have got
a bit of a problem.

18:29.021 --> 18:31.501
But, ah, it's probably something
I can deal with myself, actually.

18:31.536 --> 18:33.586
Business?
Yeah, yeah.

18:33.621 --> 18:35.386
Someone's undercutting them.

18:35.421 --> 18:37.341
Selling really cheap stuff
all over town.

18:37.376 --> 18:39.059
Sorry, mate, I can't help you.

18:40.541 --> 18:42.226
No, appreciate it.

18:42.261 --> 18:47.101
Hey, Lewis, has Jason
talked to his lawyer this week?

18:47.136 --> 18:48.546
Should he?

18:48.581 --> 18:50.661
I would. See, the OPP
have got another witness.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.501
You know, with this mess
in King Street.

18:53.501 --> 18:56.981
Apparently they've tracked down
some African bloke who was there.

18:57.016 --> 18:58.981
Right. Do we know where he lives?

18:59.016 --> 19:00.461
In Africa.

19:00.496 --> 19:01.894
Fuck.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.906
Yeah, so it's gonna make it
pretty tricky.

19:04.941 --> 19:08.941
So, if I was Jason,
I'd put some serious thought

19:08.976 --> 19:10.981
into organising a character witness.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.414
Oh.

19:13.461 --> 19:14.906
Like who?

19:14.941 --> 19:17.101
Well, someone of good standing
in the community.

19:17.136 --> 19:18.546
This is what Mario reckons.

19:18.581 --> 19:21.066
You know, well known, respected.

19:21.101 --> 19:24.501
Someone who's prepared to stand up
in front of a jury and swear blind

19:24.536 --> 19:28.494
what a gentle, peace-Ioving
family man you are.

19:32.141 --> 19:33.621
Right.

19:33.656 --> 19:35.066
Yeah.

19:35.101 --> 19:37.899
Look, I'll leave that one
with you, I reckon.

19:38.941 --> 19:41.978
In the meantime, I'll see what I can do
about your other little problem.

19:48.341 --> 19:50.226
Thanks, Dad.

19:50.261 --> 19:54.334
So, there's this big batch of amphets
selling at 12 bucks a pill.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.277
Yeah, I heard.

19:57.312 --> 19:58.893
Is it yours, Tony? Yes or no?

19:59.941 --> 20:01.374
No, mate.

20:02.781 --> 20:03.816
It's not me.

20:05.261 --> 20:07.181
Undercutting just upsets people.

20:07.216 --> 20:08.821
Creates bad feeling.

20:08.856 --> 20:10.338
It's not me.

20:10.373 --> 20:11.786
I'm a good guy.

20:11.821 --> 20:15.141
Jason and Mark are pretty upset.
I know.

20:15.176 --> 20:17.466
A lot of people are upset.

20:17.501 --> 20:18.946
You've gotta get 'em to calm down.

20:18.981 --> 20:20.861
It's probably just some kid
out in the suburbs

20:20.896 --> 20:22.306
doesn't know the business.

20:22.341 --> 20:25.301
That's all. It's gonna work out.

20:25.336 --> 20:27.341
No need for fireworks.

20:27.376 --> 20:28.946
I'll ask around.

20:28.981 --> 20:30.426
Are you right to get the coffees?

20:30.461 --> 20:34.026
Yeah, yeah.
But it's a loan, not a shout.

20:34.061 --> 20:37.621
You owe me three bucks fifty
at 5% compound interest,

20:37.656 --> 20:39.266
starting... right now.

20:39.301 --> 20:41.021
Oh, jeez, you're a tight-arse.

20:41.056 --> 20:42.454
Me?

20:45.341 --> 20:46.786
All square?

20:46.821 --> 20:50.496
Yeah. Let's do this again some time.

21:08.981 --> 21:11.101
I've just heard
you're in the nightclub scene.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.706
Yeah?
Yeah.

21:12.741 --> 21:15.186
And my thing is, see,
I can make the stuff.

21:15.221 --> 21:18.501
But I need some mates
to help me get it out to the punters.

21:18.536 --> 21:20.781
So you need
a distribution manager?

21:20.816 --> 21:22.306
Exactly.

21:22.341 --> 21:24.301
So, if you've got
some time tomorrow,

21:24.336 --> 21:26.157
maybe we can meet somewhere quieter.

21:26.192 --> 21:27.979
See if we can get a deal together.

21:50.981 --> 21:52.461
Hey, fat boy.

21:52.496 --> 21:53.906
Fuck you, Jason.

21:53.941 --> 21:56.250
You keep your fucking hands
off my best mate's wife, alright?

22:17.741 --> 22:19.626
G'day, Mick - Carl.

22:19.661 --> 22:22.501
We met here once before -
with me dad.

22:22.536 --> 22:24.546
Yeah, I remember.

22:24.581 --> 22:28.186
Yeah. Well, here we are again, yeah.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.101
Well, it seems that way.
Yeah.

22:31.136 --> 22:32.056
Yep.

22:47.221 --> 22:48.666
He uses his feet pretty well,

22:48.701 --> 22:51.581
don't you think,
this fellow in the blue?

22:51.616 --> 22:53.026
He's very elusive.

22:53.061 --> 22:56.201
Yeah, I think these are
the sort of fighters that,

22:56.236 --> 22:58.863
I mean, if you've got
some speed on you, then,

22:58.898 --> 23:01.491
well, it doesn't hurt, does it?

23:05.581 --> 23:07.026
Why are you ripping us off, Jason?

23:07.061 --> 23:08.661
What the fuck are you talking about,
Dino?

23:08.696 --> 23:10.458
The Russian and me
are both getting undercut.

23:10.493 --> 23:12.221
We figured it's gotta be you.
Is that right?

23:12.256 --> 23:14.386
Yeah. You owe me 11 grand, Jason.

23:14.421 --> 23:16.301
How about blowin' it out your arse,
dickhead?!

23:16.336 --> 23:18.626
Hey, hey, hey. I've got it, Jase.

23:18.661 --> 23:21.621
Hey, you take on the Morans,
you take on all of us.

23:21.656 --> 23:23.346
That includes me.

23:23.381 --> 23:25.121
And you wanna get
your head smashed in,

23:25.156 --> 23:26.861
just keep going
the way you're goin'.

23:26.896 --> 23:28.294
Smart arse.

23:50.141 --> 23:52.226
Hey, you don't have to leave
just because I'm leaving.

23:52.261 --> 23:55.101
Oh, no, no, no, no. The best part
of the night's over anyway.

23:55.136 --> 23:57.061
Some good up-and-coming juniors,
though, yeah?

23:57.096 --> 23:58.066
Oh, yeah.

23:58.101 --> 24:02.141
Did you ever see Andrew Veniamin
fight before he broke his leg?

24:02.176 --> 24:04.106
The best I've ever seen.

24:04.141 --> 24:06.860
What was it - under-15, under-16
junior heavyweight?

24:23.541 --> 24:25.781
Now, you probably know
most of what I'm gonna tell you.

24:25.816 --> 24:27.261
Correction - I'm sure you know.

24:27.296 --> 24:29.377
But just indulge me.

24:30.701 --> 24:34.541
Here at Homicide there is only
one way we do things - by the book.

24:34.576 --> 24:37.101
If you wanna behave like a cowboy,
you move to Queensland.

24:38.141 --> 24:39.586
I don't like the humidity.

24:39.621 --> 24:43.681
The aim here is to search for the truth -
whatever that may be.

24:43.716 --> 24:47.741
I'm not interested in convictions
based on shonky evidence.

24:47.776 --> 24:54.741
P-T-T - professionalism,
thoroughness, tenacity.

24:54.776 --> 24:56.299
Those are our watchwords.

24:57.461 --> 25:01.136
Well, welcome to Homicide.
Thanks, boss.

25:05.501 --> 25:06.934
Would you like a shortbread?

25:07.981 --> 25:09.414
I baked them myself.

25:10.461 --> 25:12.611
Hey.
Hey.

25:13.661 --> 25:16.061
Have you got the bug up and running
in Dino's house yet?

25:16.096 --> 25:17.506
Nearly.

25:17.541 --> 25:19.501
What about the T.I. On the mobile?

25:19.536 --> 25:21.453
Yeah, yeah, they're active.

25:21.488 --> 25:23.370
Now all we've gotta do is wait.

25:25.341 --> 25:26.774
Did you get the shortbread?

25:28.941 --> 25:30.781
Yeah, look, I know,
the bloke's a treasure, right?

25:30.816 --> 25:32.226
But he knows
what he's talking about.

25:32.261 --> 25:35.261
There's only one way
to do things around here in Homicide,

25:35.296 --> 25:38.333
Steve Owen,
and that's... by the book.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.226
Hey, hey, hang on.

25:41.261 --> 25:42.694
Something's coming through.

25:43.941 --> 25:46.741
Jeez, it's really clear.
Where did we get this gear - the FBI?

25:46.776 --> 25:48.186
Is it Dino?

25:48.221 --> 25:50.906
No. It's just the bloody radio.

25:50.941 --> 25:53.321
Well, if he's not home, where is he?

25:53.356 --> 25:55.666
I dunno - trawling for chicks, movies.

25:55.701 --> 25:58.786
What do other drug dealers do
during the day?

25:58.821 --> 26:03.053
# There were
10 big gangsters sittin' on a wall

26:04.341 --> 26:08.941
# 10 big gangsters
sittin' on a wall

26:08.976 --> 26:10.932
# And if one big gangster... #

26:11.981 --> 26:14.141
Stand back, Rich.
Drop that fuckin' screwdriver.

26:14.176 --> 26:16.266
I just finished fixin' that.
Stick 'em up, prick.

26:16.301 --> 26:18.941
Mate, 50 bucks that cost me
for a hinge and a new lock,

26:18.976 --> 26:20.415
and I bought a screwdriver.

26:20.450 --> 26:21.854
Shut up! Get over there.

26:23.901 --> 26:26.106
What are you doing, Dino?
Getting our money.

26:26.141 --> 26:30.701
What?! How much money do you reckon
I've got, you Italian fruitcakes?

26:30.736 --> 26:32.826
Hey!

26:32.861 --> 26:36.058
Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:48.341 --> 26:49.979
Worth 11 grand?

27:24.821 --> 27:26.254
Dino...

27:27.461 --> 27:28.894
Ta, mate.

27:44.141 --> 27:45.586
Oi, you pay for those, mate.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.901
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

27:47.936 --> 27:49.946
Hey. Hey, mate, back here.

27:49.981 --> 27:51.461
If you're gonna put it with petrol...

27:51.496 --> 27:53.621
Shut up or die, pickle brain.

27:53.656 --> 27:55.066
Ow!

27:55.101 --> 27:56.381
Hey, Rocco.

28:10.621 --> 28:12.816
How the hell did you think
you could beat us, Rich?

28:24.541 --> 28:27.141
Fuck! Was that just like the movies,
or what?

28:27.176 --> 28:28.574
They're back.

28:29.981 --> 28:33.181
Except why do they build a car with
a lever to open the boot from inside?

28:33.216 --> 28:35.092
What's the point?
Who cares? We smashed it now.

28:36.501 --> 28:38.810
Oh, you prick.
Come here.

28:42.141 --> 28:44.036
It sounds like they're having sex.

28:44.071 --> 28:45.932
What have you got? What have you got?

28:46.981 --> 28:48.426
Come on.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.221
What did you get from his bedroom?

28:50.256 --> 28:51.654
Dunno.

28:53.341 --> 28:55.306
He had fucking, ah, $300.

28:55.341 --> 28:57.821
Chuck in what we had in the kitchen.

28:57.856 --> 29:00.301
What have we got then, $360, $370?

29:00.336 --> 29:02.106
Yeah.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.574
Well, mate, it's a start.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.094
We've got the upper hand now.

29:08.141 --> 29:09.986
We call the shots.

29:10.021 --> 29:13.261
Either Jason pays up,
kill the madman.

29:14.741 --> 29:16.781
What? Are they talking about Bruno?

29:16.816 --> 29:19.061
They've kidnapped Mladenich.

29:19.096 --> 29:21.074
What? When?

29:21.109 --> 29:23.052
Now. Right now.

29:24.901 --> 29:26.386
He's in Dino's boot.

29:26.421 --> 29:30.421
What? Who the hell is gonna pay
a ransom for Richard Mladenich?

29:30.456 --> 29:32.412
You've gotta be joking.

29:35.301 --> 29:36.746
What the hell is this?

29:36.781 --> 29:38.341
Do you wanna see Rich again?

29:38.376 --> 29:39.786
Why?

29:39.821 --> 29:41.941
Give us 25 grand
and we'll let him go.

29:41.976 --> 29:43.678
How about piss off?

29:43.713 --> 29:45.346
We're serious, Jason.

29:45.381 --> 29:47.706
We're down 11 grand thanks to you.

29:47.741 --> 29:50.175
And unless we get our money,
Rich has had it.

29:51.221 --> 29:52.826
Alright, alright. Two things.

29:52.861 --> 29:56.821
Number one - I had nothing
to do with it, you fuckin' idiot.

29:56.856 --> 30:00.131
Number two - I don't care
what you do with him.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.581
He hung up on me.

30:03.616 --> 30:04.546
Prick!

30:04.581 --> 30:06.572
He's hung up on them.
What?

30:08.181 --> 30:10.421
Hang on, hang on, wait.
Let's just think for a sec.

30:10.456 --> 30:11.866
Think for a sec.

30:11.901 --> 30:14.893
We've gotta find someone who's gonna
give us money for him, right?

30:15.941 --> 30:17.781
There's gotta be someone.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.214
Doesn't there?

30:31.741 --> 30:33.386
What's going on?
Dunno.

30:33.421 --> 30:35.377
They're trying to think of
their next move.

30:42.941 --> 30:45.681
If Dino starts talking about
shooting Bruno, we've got him.

30:45.716 --> 30:48.421
Yeah, and if Mladenich suffocates
in the meantime, we're gone.

30:48.456 --> 30:49.866
Oh, come on. He'll be fine.

30:49.901 --> 30:51.786
He's bound and gagged in a boot.

30:51.821 --> 30:54.621
It can't be any worse than sharing
a cell with 'Chopper' Read, can it?

30:54.656 --> 30:56.066
Did he?

30:56.101 --> 30:57.906
Yeah, over a year, when he was 16.
Oh.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.146
Now, come on, boss,
we have to let this run.

31:00.181 --> 31:03.181
One mention of Bruno, that's all,
and we've got Dino for murder.

31:03.216 --> 31:04.626
I'm sorry, Steve.

31:04.661 --> 31:06.621
You're gonna love this.
They called Mokbel.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.581
Reckoned he might give them
25 for a hit.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.138
On Mladenich?
Yeah.

31:10.173 --> 31:11.626
He wouldn't, of course.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.021
Now they're stuck with a bloke
no-one wants either way -

31:14.056 --> 31:15.466
dead or alive.

31:15.501 --> 31:16.946
Are they still talking, though?

31:16.981 --> 31:18.706
No, Rocco's gone out
to get some food.

31:18.741 --> 31:20.901
And some other bloke's come around -
Carl someone...

31:20.936 --> 31:22.786
What? Carl's in on this too?

31:22.821 --> 31:25.021
No, no, no.
He's here about something else.

31:25.056 --> 31:26.466
They've gone out into the backyard.

31:26.501 --> 31:29.301
As much fun as we're having here,
it's time to break this party up.

31:29.336 --> 31:31.426
To the rest of us,

31:31.461 --> 31:35.061
Carl was just one of dozens
of shadowy figures on the periphery.

31:35.096 --> 31:37.741
But for Steve,
he was already something more.

31:37.776 --> 31:39.986
I like working with you, Dino.

31:40.021 --> 31:42.941
So I'm thinking about 10 G a month?

31:42.976 --> 31:44.517
How's that sound?

31:44.552 --> 31:46.059
You'll pay me?
Yeah.

31:47.101 --> 31:48.826
If I want you to stick with me,

31:48.861 --> 31:51.821
I've gotta look after
your cashflow, right?

31:51.856 --> 31:54.781
So, instead of me
selling you a bag of pills,

31:54.816 --> 31:56.866
let's agree on a monthly retainer.

31:56.901 --> 32:00.981
Then I supply you with pills and
we split whatever you sell 'em for.

32:01.016 --> 32:03.051
It's easy-peasy. Everyone's happy.

32:22.781 --> 32:25.226
Mr Dibra?
Yeah?

32:25.261 --> 32:27.146
Jacqui James, Homicide.

32:27.181 --> 32:29.346
I've just got a couple of questions
for you

32:29.381 --> 32:31.781
about last Saturday night
and the shooting of Bruno Berlozzi.

32:31.816 --> 32:35.410
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Bruno.
Great bloke. Lovely guy.

32:36.461 --> 32:41.101
I just wanna say what happened
to him was tragic and shocking.

32:41.136 --> 32:43.541
I sincerely hope you nail
the bastard responsible.

32:43.576 --> 32:45.657
Do you mind taking your eyes off
my vagina?

32:51.781 --> 32:54.581
Also, about that Jag
parked in the driveway...

32:54.616 --> 32:56.306
A mate left it here.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.252
Great. Did he leave the keys too?

33:14.781 --> 33:16.419
You fuckin' dickhead.

33:17.461 --> 33:19.133
You've got the fuzz here,
you fuckin' shit.

33:29.581 --> 33:34.181
Alright, Dino... do you have any
information you'd like to volunteer

33:34.216 --> 33:37.381
with regards to the fatal shooting
of Mr Bruno Berlozzi?

33:37.416 --> 33:38.861
No comment.

33:38.896 --> 33:40.586
Right.

33:40.621 --> 33:43.021
And on the evening of this shooting,
were you, at any stage,

33:43.056 --> 33:45.541
in the vicinity of the Bar 20
Gentlemen's Club?

33:45.576 --> 33:47.133
No comment.

33:49.741 --> 33:51.306
Do you recall on that night

33:51.341 --> 33:54.253
being in the company of
a Miss Shelley Knight of Elsternwick?

33:55.301 --> 34:00.136
Oh, yeah - several times.
Nine, I think it was.

34:01.781 --> 34:05.701
Did you drive her back to your home
in a blue convertible Jag,

34:05.736 --> 34:08.420
which you stole from outside
the Sin City nightclub?

34:08.456 --> 34:09.985
That's a record for me, by the way.

34:10.021 --> 34:12.498
And was this the same Jag
that you used

34:12.534 --> 34:14.976
in the abduction of
Richard Mladenich?

34:16.021 --> 34:17.545
No comment.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.786
Well, did you ask him why he did it?

34:19.821 --> 34:22.781
I mean, kidnapping someone in broad
daylight in the middle of Melbourne.

34:22.815 --> 34:24.214
I did, actually.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.380
I reckon I could guess the answer.

34:27.416 --> 34:28.335
Oh, yeah?

34:29.581 --> 34:33.380
I mean, statistically, the real impetus
for that sort of behaviour

34:33.416 --> 34:35.065
goes back to family dynamics.

34:35.101 --> 34:38.426
I mean, it indicates a lack of
affection and security.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.737
He was probably the youngest child.
Always fighting to be heard.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.226
Sorry, no.

34:44.261 --> 34:47.101
He needed the money?
Well, that's what I think.

34:47.136 --> 34:48.985
But it's not what he said.

34:49.021 --> 34:53.261
Well, maybe it was that he secretly
didn't want anyone to pay the ransom,

34:53.295 --> 34:56.786
because his real plan was
to keep Richard bound and gagged

34:56.821 --> 35:00.381
so that he could play out a whole
range of homoerotic fantasies.

35:00.416 --> 35:03.146
Well... no. But you know what?

35:03.181 --> 35:05.581
In a funny sort of way,
you're closer than what you think.

35:05.616 --> 35:08.334
Just tell me this, Dino.

35:09.581 --> 35:14.132
A kidnap in broad daylight
in the middle of St Kilda.

35:15.261 --> 35:17.641
What's all that about?

35:17.676 --> 35:19.986
You know men.

35:20.021 --> 35:22.694
I guess I've just watched
'Reservoir Dogs' too many times.

35:24.381 --> 35:25.861
Right.

35:41.381 --> 35:43.146
Mr Brown?
No.

35:43.181 --> 35:45.781
But a Mr David Brown
does live at these premises?

35:45.816 --> 35:47.226
No, mate. Not here.

35:47.261 --> 35:49.501
We have a summons here
for a court appearance

35:49.536 --> 35:51.186
in regards to 11 traffic offences.

35:51.221 --> 35:53.466
And his address is listed
as 34 Hayden Place.

35:53.501 --> 35:56.661
Oh, this is 34A Hayden Place.
Yeah, you've got the wrong address.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.129
Mate, what exactly
is going on in here?

36:00.581 --> 36:02.173
Oh, nothin' much.

36:14.301 --> 36:16.226
Thanks to Carl,

36:16.261 --> 36:19.297
Jason and Mark's $80,000 pill press
was impounded,

36:19.332 --> 36:22.333
along with nearly a million bucks
worth of ecstasy.

36:24.501 --> 36:26.941
Oh, now we can all get some sleep.
Yeah.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.746
Who the fuck
do they think they are?

36:28.781 --> 36:31.521
Well, they're fuckin' Morans,
that's who they think they are.

36:31.556 --> 36:34.261
And then Carl was
released on bail, pending charges,

36:34.296 --> 36:36.226
just as Dino had been.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.426
You've gotta stand up to 'em, Carl.

36:38.461 --> 36:41.101
Don't just go, "Sorry, sorry, sorry."
Just fuck 'em.

36:41.136 --> 36:43.421
It's just sheer fucking bad fucking luck.

36:43.456 --> 36:44.866
Fuck.

36:44.901 --> 36:47.106
Shit happens.
Yeah.

36:47.141 --> 36:48.586
So you lost a pill press.

36:48.621 --> 36:50.066
OK, you'll pay 'em back.
Yeah.

36:50.101 --> 36:52.341
I'll call Tony and you can
borrow his for a bit.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.306
Yeah?

36:53.341 --> 36:55.226
So, we can still, like, trade.

36:55.261 --> 36:57.821
Just get some balls
and go and talk to 'em.

36:57.856 --> 36:59.746
You're good at that, babe.

36:59.781 --> 37:02.141
Oh, thanks, Bobbie.
Yeah, of course you are.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.893
Alright, I'll give 'em a call.

37:45.781 --> 37:47.301
Jase, Mark.

37:47.336 --> 37:48.786
Carl.

37:48.821 --> 37:50.226
Thanks for meeting me.

37:50.261 --> 37:52.501
I can't say it's a pleasure.

37:52.536 --> 37:54.226
No.

37:54.261 --> 37:55.819
So what are we gonna do about it?

37:56.861 --> 37:59.021
First of all I just wanna
make things clear, right?

37:59.056 --> 38:00.658
For the record -

38:00.693 --> 38:02.217
it wasn't my fault.

38:02.252 --> 38:03.736
It wasn't his fault.

38:03.771 --> 38:05.186
No, no, not his fault.

38:05.221 --> 38:07.221
The stupid jacks came to
the wrong address, didn't they?

38:07.256 --> 38:08.858
And who let 'em in the house?

38:08.893 --> 38:10.426
Did they have a search warrant?

38:10.461 --> 38:14.301
No, no. So what were you doin'?
Giving them a guided fucking tour?

38:14.336 --> 38:15.746
They heard it.
Jesus.

38:15.781 --> 38:18.101
I couldn't push 'em out.
They just came in...

38:18.136 --> 38:20.146
Of course you can push 'em out.

38:20.181 --> 38:22.421
No search warrant -
they shouldn't be in the front door.

38:22.456 --> 38:24.226
Oh, don't!

38:24.261 --> 38:27.571
Alright, alright, alright.

38:32.981 --> 38:37.021
Give you a month to come up with
the 80 grand for the pill press, yeah?

38:37.056 --> 38:39.781
Yeah, OK. Fair enough, no worries.

38:39.816 --> 38:41.214
Right.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.501
What do you mean, "They heard it"?

38:44.536 --> 38:45.946
What?

38:45.981 --> 38:48.026
The cop, you said
he heard the pill press.

38:48.061 --> 38:51.101
What was it doin' on when we
hadn't asked you to make anything?

38:51.136 --> 38:54.141
I... I was, um, you know,
making sure it was in good nick.

38:54.176 --> 38:56.301
See it was in good working order, yeah?

38:56.336 --> 38:58.226
He's been pressing his own stuff.

38:58.261 --> 39:00.901
All that cheap shit on the street,
that's him. That's you, isn't it?

39:00.936 --> 39:02.541
Using our press,
which you've now lost!

39:02.576 --> 39:03.496
No!

39:04.541 --> 39:06.621
Of course.
He didn't pay for the press.

39:06.656 --> 39:08.701
He's not paying for
the rent on the house.

39:08.736 --> 39:10.134
He can sell 'em cheap.

39:13.261 --> 39:14.826
We've been copping shit
off everyone.

39:14.861 --> 39:17.396
Losing money hand over fist
all 'cause of this...

39:17.431 --> 39:19.932
<i>... this spineless little piece of shit. Fuck!</i>

39:23.301 --> 39:24.381
No, Jase!

39:29.781 --> 39:31.599
80 grand by next week.

39:31.634 --> 39:33.417
Take Roberta and piss off.

39:35.021 --> 39:36.466
You just shot him, you idiot.

39:36.501 --> 39:38.586
So what? It's a fucking derringer.
He'll live.

39:38.621 --> 39:41.306
It's a bullet wound.
He's gotta go to the hospital now.

39:41.341 --> 39:43.980
The cops will wanna know what
happened, and you're out on bail.

39:48.221 --> 39:49.717
Just kill him.

39:49.752 --> 39:51.214
It's easier.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.214
Kill him.

40:06.901 --> 40:09.781
Nuh, nuh. I want my 80 grand.
If I kill him, I'm never gonna see it.

40:09.816 --> 40:11.581
Jesus Christ, Jason.
What are you doin'?

40:11.616 --> 40:13.014
No, no, no - it's alright.

40:19.981 --> 40:21.426
Listen.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.186
There's something you need to know.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.461
You see, we've got a whole lot
of cops in our back pocket.

40:26.496 --> 40:27.786
Hmm?

40:27.821 --> 40:31.181
As a matter of fact, they're our
main source of pseudoephedrine.

40:31.216 --> 40:32.946
How about that, huh?

40:32.981 --> 40:35.861
So you whisper one word of this -
one word - to anyone,

40:35.896 --> 40:38.538
and you'll end up in the slammer,
quick smart.

40:38.573 --> 40:41.146
And I've got a whole lot
of friends in there too.

40:41.181 --> 40:47.741
So, you see, there is nowhere
on this planet that you can hide. Hmm?

40:47.776 --> 40:50.460
Until you pay us back...

40:51.501 --> 40:53.219
<i>... you belong to us.</i>

41:13.021 --> 41:15.821
A few weeks later,
and much to everyone's relief,

41:15.856 --> 41:18.381
Jason was finally convicted
over the King Street brawl

41:18.416 --> 41:19.814
and jailed for two years.

41:23.381 --> 41:25.781
Carl recovered from
the gunshot wound,

41:25.816 --> 41:27.746
but he was never the same again.

41:27.781 --> 41:30.659
The Moran boys would have
been better to finish the job.
