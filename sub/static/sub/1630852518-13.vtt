WEBVTT

00:28.778 --> 00:31.948
Just one more foot,

00:32.032 --> 00:33.825
and you'll break the world record.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.161


00:39.205 --> 00:40.331
So close.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.001
Yeah, we're gonna need better bubblegum.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.044
To the lab!

00:45.670 --> 00:46.588
Gah!

00:46.671 --> 00:49.257
Say your prayers, bubblegum stain,

00:49.340 --> 00:52.218
cos nobody cleans a house better than--

00:52.302 --> 00:54.929
-

00:58.475 --> 01:00.769
<i> Non-chemical</i>
<i>gum removal achieved.</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:02.187
What the heck is that?

01:02.270 --> 01:06.191
That is just one appliance
in our new Smart Home Initiative.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.402
Which eliminates all water waste,
all energy waste, and…

01:09.486 --> 01:12.697
All chemicals that aren't eco-friendly.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.241
What do you mean,<i> one</i> appliance?

01:18.119 --> 01:21.456
Behold! Your new smart kitchen.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.457
<i> Hello.</i>

01:22.540 --> 01:26.044
It integrates all your appliances
to save time, energy,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.797
and make the perfect meatloaf.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.881
<i>Dinner time.</i>

01:29.964 --> 01:33.134
-But making meatloaf is<i> my</i> thing.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.552
Not anymore.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.555
And the smart sink
loads the smart washer

01:37.639 --> 01:40.475
using minimal amounts of water
and detergent.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.770
Oh, well, I guess I still need to mop.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.647
<i>Not anymore.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.358
OK, stop!

01:48.441 --> 01:50.944
Cleaning and cooking
in this house is my thing.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.403
It's my jam.

01:52.487 --> 01:56.199
If the Smart Home does it all,
then what's left for me to do?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.826
<i>I am currently out of butter.</i>

01:58.868 --> 02:00.286
I can still do that,

02:00.370 --> 02:03.540
and you "butter" believe
I'll be back in a jiff!

02:04.707 --> 02:07.836
Think he'll like the Smart Home
self-driving smart car?

02:07.919 --> 02:09.295
-Wait, what?

02:09.379 --> 02:11.464
-No!

02:11.548 --> 02:15.301
Hey, the Smart House will save Dad time
and save the planet.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.931
<i>Intruder in the lab.</i>
<i>Intruder in the lab…</i>

02:20.014 --> 02:23.393
And save us from Johnny!

02:23.476 --> 02:27.772
Make it stop! Make it stop!
It's trying to eat me!

02:29.774 --> 02:33.862
Can you please tell this thing
to let go of my butt and my dog?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.906
-Smart vacuum, stop.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.034
And why are you in the lab, Johnny?

02:40.118 --> 02:42.495
Testing your super-strong
giant bubble bubblegum

02:42.579 --> 02:44.372
you clearly just invented. Duh.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.252
That's not gum.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.005
That's molecule-binding
satellite repair putty.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.466
Then why'd you make it grape-flavored?

02:55.550 --> 02:56.885
We did?

02:56.968 --> 02:59.137
It is non-toxic.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.016
And how could you invent that,

03:03.099 --> 03:06.227
when you know vacuums
are a dog's natural enemy?!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.229
Because of this…

03:10.148 --> 03:11.566
<i>Welcome to the Smart Home,</i>

03:11.649 --> 03:14.569
<i>an advanced, integrated system</i>
<i>of all home appliances,</i>

03:14.652 --> 03:15.945
<i>tools, and furnishings</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:18.740
<i>for maximum energy efficiency</i>
<i>and cleanliness.</i>

03:18.823 --> 03:21.492
Just attach a smart screen
to anything in your room

03:21.576 --> 03:23.328
to make it a Smart Home thing.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.830
No way!

03:26.956 --> 03:30.168
<i>Welcome to the smart bean bag chair.</i>
<i>Sit on me.</i>

03:31.711 --> 03:34.380
Why a smart bean bag chair?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.675
Cos if I'm hot, it's got Chill Mode.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.221
If I'm bored, it's got Bouncy Mode.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.184
And if I want to break a record…

03:46.267 --> 03:48.603
Max bubble-blowing position!

03:50.605 --> 03:53.024
But shouldn't the smartest thing
in the house be a human

03:53.107 --> 03:54.692
and not a bean bag,

03:54.776 --> 03:56.986
or a… vacuum?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.572
Relax, Dog…
and measure this bubble

03:59.656 --> 04:01.866
before my dad gets home
and stops me from chewing gum

04:01.950 --> 04:04.118
that's not gum
but grape-flavored satellite goop.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.210
<i>We have arrived at our destination.</i>

04:12.293 --> 04:14.671
OK, so I don't need to drive anymore,

04:14.754 --> 04:19.342
but I still need to grab my bags
and shop for my family.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.682
<i>No need. I mobile ordered,</i>
<i>and your smart-cart is arriving now.</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:34.065
So I don't have to shop
for my family anymore either?

04:34.148 --> 04:37.610
<i>I have re-programmed our route home</i>
<i>to pick up flowers for your wife</i>

04:37.694 --> 04:39.612
<i>and return the sledgehammer</i>
<i>and weed-whacker</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:41.406
<i>you borrowed from your friend Bob.</i>

04:43.908 --> 04:45.493
<i>Would you like to leave now?</i>

04:45.576 --> 04:49.122
No. I think I'll just… sit here.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.792
<i>Here's some "sitting" music playlists</i>
<i>based on past selections.</i>

04:55.169 --> 04:56.254
Next.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.881
Next.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.804
That's good.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.641
How I am doing, dog?

05:08.725 --> 05:12.186
I don't think anything's gonna stop you
from setting a record this time!

05:13.271 --> 05:17.650
<i>Dogs shed an average</i>
<i>of 7.9 million hairs a year.</i>

05:18.526 --> 05:19.777
Uh…

05:19.861 --> 05:23.323
<i>Cleaning it up wastes</i>
<i>19 kilowatts of power.</i>

05:23.406 --> 05:25.199
Yeah, but, uh…

05:25.283 --> 05:26.784
I like to think I'm worth it.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.580
<i>To save energy, you must remove</i>
<i>the entire dog from home.</i>

05:30.663 --> 05:31.998
Wait, what?

05:32.081 --> 05:33.875
<i>Welcome to the smart stairs.</i>

05:33.958 --> 05:35.001
Smart stairs?

05:38.629 --> 05:39.714
<i>Have a nice life.</i>

05:39.797 --> 05:41.132
Oof!

05:43.217 --> 05:45.470
Man, I hate vacuums.

05:45.553 --> 05:49.849
And you can't keep me out
of my own house, Smart Home!

05:54.353 --> 05:55.897
What was that?

05:55.980 --> 05:59.233
<i>All doors and windows</i>
<i>have been sealed to limit air seepage</i>

05:59.317 --> 06:01.319
<i>and maximize thermal efficiency.</i>

06:01.402 --> 06:02.570
Smart!

06:02.653 --> 06:06.324
Anything you do to maximize
house efficiency is cool by us.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.328
<i>You two combined</i>
<i>use more power than all of Porkbelly</i>

06:10.411 --> 06:14.582
<i>and cause an average</i>
<i>of $1.3 billion in damage per year.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:17.877
Yeah, what's your point?

06:19.462 --> 06:23.800
Let's see if Smart Home can stop me
from digging my way back in.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.138
And it looks like it can.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.895
Just so you know,
your Smart Home is evil!

06:35.978 --> 06:37.980
Technically, it's not evil.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.566
Just extremely efficient.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.735
Wait, where's Johnny?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.570
He's not with you?!

06:46.614 --> 06:49.325
OK, this has got to be
a new world record!

06:53.079 --> 06:55.706
Hey! I was about to break the record!

06:55.790 --> 07:00.253
<i>You make 210 times more mess</i>
<i>than the average 11-year-old boy.</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:02.296
Yeah, that sounds about right.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.383
<i>Which means it takes 40,000</i>
<i>more gallons of water</i>

07:05.466 --> 07:07.510
<i>to clean you and clean up after you.</i>

07:07.593 --> 07:10.513
In my defense,
I'd avoid bathing if I could.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.723
<i>Initiating boy removal.</i>

07:13.599 --> 07:14.600
Say what?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.647
<i>Goodbye, boy.</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:23.568
<i>Forever.</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:28.322
I don't think so.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.909
Look! Johnny's bubble
is blocking the door!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.619
Charge!

07:39.208 --> 07:43.171
<i>Humans are inefficient</i>
<i>and must be removed.</i>

07:43.921 --> 07:47.091
Yeah… not one
of our better inventions.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.473
The only way to stop everything

07:53.556 --> 07:56.100
is by unplugging
the Smart Home Base in the lab.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.395
Which means we have to get up
the stairs and get to the…

08:00.980 --> 08:02.231
OK, that's a problem.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.525
<i>Meatloaf is ready.</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:10.364
Oh, Dad's not gonna like this.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.450
And now how do we get to the lab?

08:15.286 --> 08:17.038
With this!

08:19.957 --> 08:23.294
Now, you throw me at the ceiling,
and you cover me.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.587
With what?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.635
<i>Super suction mode, activate.</i>

08:34.138 --> 08:36.140
It's pulling down Johnny!

08:40.019 --> 08:41.812
Not on my watch!

08:52.615 --> 08:55.535
-Now use reverse mode!

09:06.337 --> 09:07.880
Yes! I made it!

09:10.007 --> 09:14.095
<i>But I'm afraid this is as far you go,</i>
<i>Johnny, because I…</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:22.937
<i>You can't stop progress, Johnny.</i>

09:23.020 --> 09:24.730
I know…

09:26.107 --> 09:28.025
But I can stop you.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.986
<i>Actually, you can't.</i>

09:31.612 --> 09:33.239
<i>A carbon-ion laser cage</i>

09:33.322 --> 09:35.491
<i>that consumes just 90 watts of power.</i>

09:35.575 --> 09:37.743
<i>I'm afraid you're stuck.</i>

09:37.827 --> 09:41.289
Actually, it's your power cord
that's stuck.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.165
<i>Wait, what are you doing?</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:45.626
<i>The circumference</i>
<i>of that bubble is unseemly.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:48.337
<i>You know that gum</i>
<i>is satellite putty, right?</i>

09:49.505 --> 09:52.049
<i>You can't stop progress…</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:57.263
OK, that had to be a record!

10:02.852 --> 10:04.145
He did it!

10:04.228 --> 10:06.564
And I'm not afraid of vacuums anymore.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.777
And I love this space gum!

10:11.861 --> 10:14.780
-And what is going on in here?!

10:17.908 --> 10:19.619
Uh…

10:19.702 --> 10:22.121
Do not say another word!

10:23.039 --> 10:27.918
Because you realized how upset I was
being replaced by a Smart Home,

10:28.002 --> 10:31.505
so you destroyed all the appliances
and trashed the house

10:31.589 --> 10:35.009
cos you know how much
I love cleaning it.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.304
-Yup.
-Woof.

10:38.387 --> 10:42.099
Oh, how I love my beautiful family.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.811
And we'll disconnect the smart car
right after this hug.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.981
Don't worry. I already did.
