WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.499
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.712 --> 00:05.579
Kira, you forgot all the research
you did for that boy you like.

00:06.716 --> 00:07.626
We're not leaving without it.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.083
Somebody
really doesn't want our hands in there.

00:10.261 --> 00:11.501
We're gonna need a lot more help.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.507
Lydia's gol sort of a talent.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.636
I'm psychic.

00:14.807 --> 00:15.762
You opened a door.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.842
It will draw them here,
like a beacon.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.322
Bring him around back. And keep it quiel.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.861
No one needs to know except for the people
who absolutely need to know.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.747
Oh, here we go.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.959
Hey. He is not coming in.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.419
- This is the only hospital that will take him.
- What about County?

00:51.636 --> 00:54.378
You'd be surprised how fast things fill up
when a guy like this needs surgery.

00:54.597 --> 00:55.882
- They turfed him to us?
- Yeah.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.799
- If County doesn't want to operate on him...
- Then someone has to.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.656
Somebody needs to do his pre-op interview.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.028
Who usually does that?

01:19.664 --> 01:20.779
Me.

01:25.211 --> 01:27.998
Get your ass down here now.
We have a job to do.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.998
Dude, I'm already in bed.
And aren't we getting a little old for this?

01:31.217 --> 01:32.332
We do this for Coach.

01:32.552 --> 01:34.213
I thought we did this to Coach.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.670
Whatever, okay? You know he needs this.
He lives for this stuff, you know? He loves it.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.266
But it's the middle of the night.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.178
12:15 actually.

01:42.562 --> 01:47.556
Which means it's after midnight
and officially Mischief Night/ Day,

01:47.775 --> 01:51.484
and, by perfectly awesome coincidence,
it also happens to be Coach's birthday.

01:51.696 --> 01:54.438
So if you are not down
here in five seconds, I will destroy you.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.740
Okay? And I mean five, four, three, two...

02:01.747 --> 02:03.248
- One.
- I hate you.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.869
Try to keep in mind
exactly what this guy's capable of.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.918
He's a former electrical engineer who
decided to walk onto a school bus

02:09.088 --> 02:10.328
with a shrapnel bomb.

02:10.548 --> 02:14.040
He left four students dead
and a fifth with no legs.

02:14.260 --> 02:18.924
Just out of curiosity, have any of his
psychiatrists made any progress?

02:20.016 --> 02:22.223
I'm told he says the same thing
almost every day.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.387
When he gets out, he's going to do it again.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.519
And next time, he's going to get it right.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.191
Mr. Barrow,

02:32.403 --> 02:35.145
do you understand that scar tissue
has formed around a piece of shrapnel

02:35.364 --> 02:37.400
that remains in your body
from a previous injury

02:37.617 --> 02:39.482
and that it is now blocking vital functions?

02:40.703 --> 02:41.692
Yes.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.120
Do you understand that
we must put you under general anesthesia

02:45.333 --> 02:48.370
tomorrow morning
in order to remove the obstruction?

02:51.547 --> 02:54.539
Do the kids still
pull pranks the day before Halloween?

02:54.759 --> 02:56.215
You mean Mischief Night?

02:56.427 --> 03:01.137
Where I'm from, we called it Hell Night.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.721
And, yes, I understand.

03:07.146 --> 03:11.014
Do you have any allergies
to any medications?

03:11.609 --> 03:12.564
No.

03:12.735 --> 03:16.148
Are you taking any medications
other than the ones listed here?

03:16.364 --> 03:18.070
Temazepam. Divalproex.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.986
| just take what they give me.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.281
I'm going to need to listen to his heart.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.588
In...

03:43.099 --> 03:44.305
And out.

04:02.785 --> 04:06.323
Why don't you just
ask the question you really want to ask?

04:13.045 --> 04:14.501
Why did you do it?

04:15.131 --> 04:17.042
I saw their eyes.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.338
Their eyes were glowing.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.094
I saw them.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.435
I saw their eyes!

04:31.605 --> 04:34.221
Their eyes were glowing!
Their eyes were glowing!

04:37.820 --> 04:40.027
Their eyes were glowing!

05:28.788 --> 05:30.119
You're back in school?

05:30.372 --> 05:31.908
No, just to talk.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.947
Oh. That's kind of
a change of pace for you guys.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.503
Seeing as how usually, you're
just hurting, maiming, and killing.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.040
You need a pack. We need an Alpha.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.338
Yeah. Absolutely not.
That's hilarious though.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.710
You came to us for help. We helped.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.667
You beat his face into a bloody pulp.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.344
That's not helping. In my opinion,
that's actually counter-productive.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.716
Why would I say yes?

05:48.933 --> 05:51.515
We'd add strength.
We'd make you more powerful.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.642
There's no reason to say no.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.271
I can think of one.
Like the two of you holding Derek's claws

05:57.483 --> 05:59.348
while Kali impaled Boyd.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.192
In fact, I don't know
why we're not impaling them right now.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.068
You want to try?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.075
Sorry, but they don't trust you.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.831
And neither do I.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.794
What now?

06:31.559 --> 06:34.175
No. No way.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.395
- We never finished.
- And we don't have to.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.892
What if I want to?

06:40.067 --> 06:43.150
You... You seriously want
to go back to high school?

06:43.362 --> 06:44.522
Is this about Lydia?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.990
This is about getting Scott
to change his mind.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.064
We're not just Betas anymore.
We're Omegas.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.157
The bitches, remember?

06:52.621 --> 06:55.363
When everyone we've screwed over
finds out we don't have a pack anymore,

06:55.541 --> 06:57.077
what do you think's going to happen?

06:57.626 --> 06:59.241
We're dead on our own.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.912
That's still better than
being back in high school.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.418
I'm not doing it. No way.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.377
What?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.096
I'm not taking math.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.688
I'll take it for you.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.653
- Move it!
- All right, that's my face!

07:28.866 --> 07:31.824
Hey, dude, good decision, buddy.
Good Alpha decision.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.781
-|hopeso.
- No, you know so.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.789
What are you looking at?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.832
- Me?
- You.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.504
You looking at her?

07:50.721 --> 07:52.632
- Her?
- Who her?

07:52.848 --> 07:54.588
Her her. Kira. You like her?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.220
No. I mean...

07:58.520 --> 08:00.385
Yeah, yeah, she's okay. She's new.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.313
- So, ask her out.
- Now?

08:03.525 --> 08:05.356
Yes, now.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.317
- Right now?
- Right now.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.945
Scott, I don't think you get it yet.
You're an Alpha.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.730
You're the apex predator.

08:11.951 --> 08:15.114
Everyone wants you. You're like
the hot girl that every guy wants.

08:15.955 --> 08:17.616
The hot girl?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.492
You are the hottest girl.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.451
What?

08:23.963 --> 08:25.499
I'm the hot girl.

08:25.714 --> 08:26.829
Yes, you are.

08:34.807 --> 08:36.172
Peek-a-boo!

09:07.256 --> 09:08.837
That's all you got?

09:09.258 --> 09:10.373
That's it?

09:19.643 --> 09:21.349
Son of a bitch!

09:24.898 --> 09:27.435
Mischief Night, Devil's Night.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.516
I don't care what you call it.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.398
You little punks are evil.

09:31.947 --> 09:36.532
You think it's funny
every Halloween my house gets egged?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.702
A man's house is supposed to be his castle.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.581
Mine's a frickin' omelet.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.080
Oh, this? We're gonna do this again?

09:50.340 --> 09:51.546
I don't think so.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.261
"Happy Birthday.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.138
"Love, Greenberg."

10:15.824 --> 10:18.315
- What are you doing?
- There's a fly.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.180
Anybody else here think
I should make a minor slip

10:45.395 --> 10:47.386
and let this bastard bleed out on the table?

10:49.733 --> 10:52.850
That's just a little surgical humor,
Melissa. Relax.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.685
Clamp, please.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.193
Sucﬁon.

11:02.121 --> 11:03.657
Let's see what we have here.

11:05.124 --> 11:06.079
Oh!

11:07.626 --> 11:09.582
Okay, that's... That's... That's not shrapnel.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.459
Uh, 10 blade. 10 blade.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.545
10 blade, please.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.463
What's the problem?
You're missing your 10 blade?

11:15.676 --> 11:18.292
Doctor... Doctor, I think you should see this.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.466
I really think you should see this.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.608
Move! Move!

11:44.288 --> 11:46.324
He's gone. Barrow's gone.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.415
He's going to be okay. Stay with me.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.539
Ow! Don't you have any anesthetic?

11:56.758 --> 11:57.713
Yep.

11:59.845 --> 12:04.384
Are you at least going
to tell me what I risked life and digit for?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.135
I'm going to show you.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.566
After the fire, that's all that was left of her.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.570
Talia. I can't decide
if that's touching or morbid.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.042
I guess the real question is,
what are you planning on doing with them?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.707
l have to ask her something.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.164
And from what I've heard,
this is the only way it's possible.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.339
You gotta be kidding me.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.136
Why do you think
| sewed your finger back on?

12:48.644 --> 12:50.305
Sheriff? Sheriff.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.726
Hey.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.102
These dead flies everywhere?
They came out of Barrow. Out of his tumor.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.602
Is that even possible?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.649
Maggots can come from the body.
It's called myiasis.

12:58.862 --> 13:02.025
But from the stomach? It's not likely.
And there's something else.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.277
Last night, he told me
why he killed those teenagers.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.984
Yeah, I know.
I read the report. Glowing eyes.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.990
We know a few kids that fit that description.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.948
Listen up, everyone.
The stolen ambulance has been spotted.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.577
Corner of Truman and Spaulding.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.169
That's three blocks from the school.
Let's go. Go!

13:21.927 --> 13:22.962
Oh, no.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.003
I don't think so.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.427
There's no way you
come back here after two weeks of nothing,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.429
with your cute little smile, the dark eyes,

13:31.645 --> 13:33.306
the brooding forehead, the muscles,

13:33.522 --> 13:36.810
and suddenly we're ripping
each other's clothes off in Coach's office.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.482
No way. It's not gonna happen.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.036
Guidance office?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.200
Okay.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.075
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
The William Barrow?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.619
The Shrapnel Bomber? Spotted nearby?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.908
A little closer than nearby, actually.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.039
How do we get down to the basement?
I need to know where every entrance is.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.166
I don't want anybody
coming in or out of the school.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.338
Dad, what's really going on here?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.594
Barrow went after kids with glowing eyes?
He said those exact words?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.138
Yeah. And no one knows
how he woke up from anesthesia.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.933
Just that when they opened him up,
they found a tumor full of live flies,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.477
which in any other circumstance
would be all kinds of awesome.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.058
Did you say flies?

14:59.274 --> 15:00.263
Lydia?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.770
All day l have been hearing this sound.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.400
It's like...

15:04.905 --> 15:06.236
This buzzing.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.359
Like the sound of flies?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.783
Exactly like the sound of flies.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.904
All I'm saying is, I don't
understand why you're sitting here with me

15:16.083 --> 15:18.540
instead of
in the cafeteria with the other kids.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.959
Maybe I want to keep you company.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.921
You should be embarrassed to be seen
with me. Not keeping me company.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.213
Kira?

15:28.303 --> 15:29.804
You must have some friends by now.

15:30.389 --> 15:33.381
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I had a lot of friends back home.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.716
But here it's like every time
| open my mouth,

15:35.936 --> 15:38.678
| just start rambling like an idiot.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.350
Try again. Fail again.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.646
Fail better.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.812
Are you quoting Samuel Beckett to me?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.776
I thought that was Yoda.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.031
Someone will show an interest.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.120
You're a beautiful girl.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.906
How could they not?

15:56.998 --> 16:00.786
The only one who's shown
any interest in me is a rabid coyote.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.833
Maybe you could date the coyote?

16:03.046 --> 16:06.334
I don't want a date.
And I definitely don't need a boyfriend.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.878
| just want to make a few friends.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.468
Hey, dude, where the hell have you been?

16:16.268 --> 16:18.884
The police are leaving.
Why are they leaving?

16:19.354 --> 16:20.560
The police?

16:20.772 --> 16:23.889
They must have cleared the building and
grounds, which means he's not here.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.316
- Who? What are you guys...
- He has to be here.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.320
That sound... The buzzing I've been hearing?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.110
It's getting louder.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.697
How loud?

16:45.547 --> 16:47.458
- Dad! Dad!
- Yeah?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.789
You can't leave yet.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.958
We got an eyewitness
that puts Barrow by the train station.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.635
- Let's go, Stilinski.
- Whoa, whoa. Dad, please just...

16:53.805 --> 16:55.466
Lydia said that he's still here.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.888
Did she see him?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.306
Not exactly. No.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.429
Well, not at all actually.
But she has a feeling.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.851
A supernatural feeling.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.904
- Lydia wasn't on the chessboard.
- She is now.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.104
- Kanima?
- Um, Banshee.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.481
- Oh, God.
- I know. I know how it sounds.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.067
But basically it means that she can sense
when someone's close to death.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.948
Can she sense that I'm about to kill you?

17:19.164 --> 17:20.324
I don't know.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.250
All right, look,
I'm not saying I don't believe,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.456
but right now,
I'm going with eyewitness over Banshee.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.049
We're leaving a few deputies here.
The school's on lockdown till 3:00.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.798
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.801
Buddy, that's the best I've got right now.
That's the best I can give you, Stiles.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.223
You're leaving me here, that is not...
That is the worst.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.806
You got it?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.146
Promise me you'll be careful.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.692
I looked right in this guy's eyes,
and it was terrifying.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.146
Yeah. Okay, Mom, I promise.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.697
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.114
Lydia thinks that he's still here even though
the cops searched the whole school.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.949
But they didn't have one thing...

18:08.880 --> 18:10.336
Our sense of smell.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.916
The Bestiary is literally 1,000 pages long.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.343
If I'm going to find anything about flies
coming out of people's bodies,

18:17.556 --> 18:18.636
it could take me all night.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.806
And remember, the word
in archaic Latin for fly is "musca."

18:22.018 --> 18:23.098
Got it.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.136
Where do we start?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.436
Upstairs.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.015
We gotta go.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.893
This is how it's gonna be now?

18:35.532 --> 18:37.068
We trust them?

18:39.494 --> 18:42.076
Just because I'm letting them help,
doesn't mean I trust them.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.200
Yeah, well, I don't trust them either.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.872
Or like them.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.289
In fact, I hate them
and just want them to die.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.917
Well, if Barrow's actually here and he's got a
plan, you might get what you want.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.761
You got something?

19:12.611 --> 19:13.771
Oh, really?

19:22.412 --> 19:24.778
Scott and Isaac are in the basement, right?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.956
Yeah, with Ethan and Aiden.
The plan is we meet in the middle,

19:28.168 --> 19:30.033
uh, in the boiler room.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.837
All of the wolves...

19:38.553 --> 19:42.045
All of the ones with glowing eyes
are in the basement at the boiler room?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.721
Oh, my God!

19:47.562 --> 19:50.269
An engineer could use a boiler room
to blow up the whole school.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.056
- We have to get them out of there.
- We have to get everyone out.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.485
How do we do that?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.419
Wow.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.052
Pulling a fire alarm
on Mischief Night is one thing.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.722
Doing it when there's a mass murderer
spotted nearby is insane!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.597
If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.309
- What? Coach, that doesn't make sense.
- Oh, well, it does to me!

20:38.446 --> 20:39.435
There.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.533
- We didn't find anything.
- Not even a scent.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.485
It's 3:00, so school's over.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.788
If there was a bomb,
wouldn't he have set it off by now?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.456
- Does that mean everybody's safe?
- I don't know.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.201
I just...

20:57.674 --> 20:58.754
I don't know.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.387
How loud are you playing that thing?

21:15.650 --> 21:17.265
Let's go! Get the hell out of here!

21:33.293 --> 21:36.000
You know, there's always an element
of danger to rituals like this.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.454
I'm not particularly fond of them.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.003
Unless they somehow

21:42.886 --> 21:44.842
benefit me.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.837
What do you want?

21:48.057 --> 21:49.797
I want to keep them.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.674
Sentimental value.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.227
She was your mother,
but she was also my sister.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.897
What? Am I not allowed
a little bit of sentiment?

22:27.597 --> 22:29.508
- Too long.
- No! No, wait!

22:39.859 --> 22:40.939
Kira?

22:43.988 --> 22:47.480
Get ready for dinner.
And, uh, put on something nice.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.904
Why would I need to wear something nice?

22:52.413 --> 22:55.655
I invited a guest for what I like to call the

22:55.875 --> 22:59.709
"Thank You for Saving My Daughter from
Becoming a Coyote Dinner" dinner.

23:02.966 --> 23:03.921
Hey.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.711
Oh, God.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.724
So, Scott, I'm sure that
as a native Californian,

23:14.936 --> 23:17.803
you've eaten at some pretty
impressive Japanese sushi restaurants.

23:18.731 --> 23:23.521
But I have to tell you
that my husband is a superb chef.

23:24.070 --> 23:29.485
Okay, we have hamachi,
uni, ikura and hirame.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.613
You've never eaten sushi before, have you?

23:37.250 --> 23:38.581
Is it all raw?

23:39.168 --> 23:40.419
Not the rice.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.664
Oh, my God, guys.
We were supposed to have lasagna tonight.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.714
l was trying to impress him.
I didn't want to bring out the...

23:45.925 --> 23:48.041
You know what? I'll make lasagna.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.503
Oh, no, no!
It's okay. I can try anything.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.130
Really.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.350
Okay.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.729
Uh...

24:03.985 --> 24:08.479
Here. Try holding this one like a pencil.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.982
- And this one goes under it, like this.
- Uh-huh.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.692
Then you just move the top one

24:14.913 --> 24:17.370
like, like this...

24:17.582 --> 24:19.072
Yeah. Thanks.

24:40.730 --> 24:41.970
Hmm.

24:48.696 --> 24:49.685
Sushi?

24:59.582 --> 25:01.163
What do the different colored strings mean?

25:01.417 --> 25:04.580
Oh, just different stages
of the investigation.

25:04.796 --> 25:08.960
So green is solved, yellow is to be
determined, blue's just pretty.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.416
- What does red mean?
- Unsolved.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.670
- You only have red on the board.
- Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.

25:15.807 --> 25:18.389
Did you get detention
for pulling the alarm?

25:18.601 --> 25:22.560
Yep. Every day this week.
It's okay, though. We were onto something.

25:23.106 --> 25:26.348
Even though we couldn't find any
proof of Barrow being there?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.526
Hey, Lydia.

25:32.115 --> 25:34.948
You've been right every time something
like this has happened, okay?

25:35.118 --> 25:37.575
So don't start doubting yourself now.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.077
No scent.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.701
No bomb.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.918
- And I got you in trouble.
- Okay, look.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.713
Barrow was there. All right?

25:51.467 --> 25:54.880
You knew it. You felt it. Okay?

25:56.889 --> 26:01.223
And look, if you wanted to, I'd go back to
that school right now and search all night

26:01.436 --> 26:03.176
just to prove it.

26:15.450 --> 26:18.362
Get up. Get up now.
We're going to the school.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.396
Electrified the windows?

26:48.608 --> 26:49.597
Yep.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.309
Didn't wanna say anything about it?

26:52.487 --> 26:54.773
- Nope.
- Okay.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.320
What are you doing here?

26:56.616 --> 26:59.323
I figured you could use an extra pair of eyes.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.701
Can you read Latin?

27:02.955 --> 27:06.493
No. But I can look at pictures.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.976
That's not exactly my color.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.565
This is going to be excruciatingly painful.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.650
Just do it.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.069
Oh, I'm going to.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.689
I just wanted you to know

27:40.618 --> 27:42.779
we all have our petty revenges.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.080
So you guys moved here from New York?

27:48.292 --> 27:51.534
I have family ties here.
Several generations.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.131
- Yukimura is Japanese, right?
- Yes.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.082
But I'm actually Korean.
When my wife and I married,

27:57.301 --> 28:00.338
I took her name, as she was the only
surviving member of her family.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.921
- You didn't want to take both names?
- We were married in Japan,

28:03.141 --> 28:06.099
where the law says that the couple
must share the same name.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.100
To belong to the same "koseki."

28:08.271 --> 28:12.014
My wife's lineage is quite unique.
I was actually going to discuss it in class.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.598
Please don't.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.355
Kira. You should be proud of your heritage.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.030
It was a profound honor
to join your mother's family.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.533
Scott? What happened to your wasabi?

28:28.416 --> 28:30.122
I thought it was guacamole.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.750
So what are we looking for?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.711
That was supposed to be locked.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.883
Yeah. I know. Notice anything else?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.385
It smells like chemicals.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.267
They wouldn't have
been able to catch his scent.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.032
He was here,
performing very minor surgery on himself.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.237
You were right.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.701
Then why don't I feel good about this?

29:11.918 --> 29:13.533
Probably because
he was here to kill somebody.

29:13.753 --> 29:16.540
- But who?
- That's what we gotta figure out.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.423
We could spread out,
start looking for... Anything.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.927
Lydia, what are those?

29:30.353 --> 29:31.718
Atomic numbers.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.849
Is it a formula?

29:38.736 --> 29:43.605
Not really. 19's potassium.
53's iodine. 88's radium.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.486
The first two make potassium iodide...

29:50.122 --> 29:51.498
Potassium is K?

29:51.749 --> 29:54.707
From kalium,
the scientific neo-Latin name.

29:57.672 --> 29:59.128
What's radium?

30:04.470 --> 30:05.676
Ra.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.132
Kira.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.112
Yes, Mom. I ate sushi.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.743
I didn't even
know that you could use chopsticks.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.950
Mom, can I ask you something?

31:12.121 --> 31:13.076
Yeah.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.779
Why didn't you...

31:16.250 --> 31:19.788
How come you never
changed your name back to Delgado?

31:20.004 --> 31:23.041
Do you mean,
why did I keep your father's name?

31:23.799 --> 31:25.460
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:26.177 --> 31:28.463
Because it's your name, too, honey.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.634
I gotta go, sweetheart, okay? I love you.

31:37.938 --> 31:42.022
Oh, thank God.
No offense to sushi.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.362
Yeah, we probably should
have started you out on California rolls.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.045
You find anything?

32:09.261 --> 32:13.049
There's a reference about flies being able
to carry messages to the dead.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.764
What about you?

32:15.935 --> 32:20.053
Oh, just... Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.326
Are you serious?

32:37.206 --> 32:38.241
What?

32:38.791 --> 32:40.873
You were just trying to kiss me.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.836
No, I wasn't.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.582
Then what were you trying to do?
Head-butt me?

32:47.216 --> 32:49.798
All right, maybe I was trying to kiss you.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.551
Are you completely,
totally out of your mind?

32:53.722 --> 32:55.178
You actually
think that I would want to kiss you?

32:55.599 --> 32:57.931
Or... Or any other werewolf again?

32:58.102 --> 33:03.813
Because trust me on this,
I would never kiss you. Ever.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.728
- Never.
- Never. Okay. All right, fine.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.439
I won't kiss you either.

33:28.757 --> 33:31.715
Allison. Can I see you in my office?

33:34.722 --> 33:36.587
Where I keep my guns.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.517
Another werewolf?

33:52.490 --> 33:55.152
Did you see her? What did you ask her?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.743
Did she say anything about me?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.746
Well, that doesn't look good.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.879
- Thanks for dinner.
- For the sushi or the pizza?

34:11.258 --> 34:13.874
Uh... The pizza was good.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.880
You seem like a really nice guy.

34:19.808 --> 34:24.051
And notjust because
you kept me from getting eaten by a coyote.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.775
Did I do something else?

34:30.361 --> 34:33.228
Yeah. You remembered my name.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.039
Scott!

34:50.422 --> 34:52.253
Scott? Scott!

34:57.596 --> 35:00.383
- Barrow, he took Kira!
- We know. He was after her the whole time.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.718
No, nothing. Just stuff
about flies and the dead. Nothing else.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.595
All right, thanks.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.389
We have to think of something.
He's going to kill her.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.976
I knew he was there.
How did I know that?

35:14.238 --> 35:17.275
- Because you heard the flies, right?
- What do you hear now?

35:19.285 --> 35:22.777
Nothing. I feel like I can do this.

35:22.997 --> 35:25.113
But I don't know what to do.

35:25.332 --> 35:28.870
It's like it's on the tip of my tongue,
and I don't know how to trigger it.

35:29.295 --> 35:34.130
ljust... I swear to God,
it literally makes me want to scream.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.876
Okay, then scream. Lydia, scream.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.248
It's not flies.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.668
It's electricity.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.471
Wait a second,
Barrow was an electrical engineer.

36:21.639 --> 36:24.176
He worked at a power substation.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.215
What substation?

36:38.238 --> 36:39.739
What are you doing?

36:42.618 --> 36:43.824
Right now?

36:45.079 --> 36:48.242
Ah. Right now,
I'm gonna take your picture.

36:51.919 --> 36:56.538
Just a little proof of our time here together.

36:57.841 --> 37:03.006
A little proof for
all of those people who never believed.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.842
Okay, you got your picture.
You want to let me go now?

37:15.818 --> 37:18.730
Did you ever see
a movie called "Village of the Damned?"

37:18.946 --> 37:21.562
The original. Not the remake.
Nobody cares about crappy remakes.

37:21.824 --> 37:26.158
I'm talking about
the 1960 black-and-white masterpiece.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.076
Huh?

37:28.247 --> 37:30.954
It's about this group of children.
BIonde-haired,

37:32.960 --> 37:34.996
beautiful children

37:36.171 --> 37:39.459
who can make their eyes glow.

37:42.136 --> 37:45.378
And they do terrible, terrible things.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.175
The tag line on the poster read,

37:48.392 --> 37:54.103
"Beware the stare
that will paralyze the will of the world."

37:56.567 --> 38:00.230
Now, when I told everyone
that I saw children with glowing eyes,

38:00.696 --> 38:04.564
they wouldn't believe me.
I tried to get them to do something.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.151
But they wouldn't budge.
They wouldn't move.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.531
As if they had been paralyzed.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.797
I am going to shake them
out of their paralysis.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.546
I'm going to get them moving.
I'm going to...

38:27.139 --> 38:30.176
I am going to galvanize them.

38:37.191 --> 38:40.729
Okay. Wait here, all right?
Just wait for the cops to come.

38:42.196 --> 38:44.778
Me? Wait, why?

38:45.741 --> 38:47.447
I only got one bat.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.372
Scott! No!

39:00.088 --> 39:01.339
Look out!

39:13.352 --> 39:17.345
Don't... She's not...
She's not the one you want.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.024
No...

39:37.835 --> 39:39.200
Don't.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.795
Stop! No!

41:07.799 --> 41:08.754
- Isaac!
- Isaac!

41:08.926 --> 41:11.417
- Isaac!
- Isaac, come on, open the door!

41:11.637 --> 41:13.377
- Isaac!
- Isaac, open up!
