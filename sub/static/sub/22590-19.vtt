<i>NARRATOR".
A festive day in Gotham City.</i>

00:17.227 --> 00:21.231
<i>And at a civic luncheon
at the Gotham-Astoria...</i>

00:21.397 --> 00:28.363
<i>...Police Commissioner Gordon
is being honored for 25 years of faithful service.</i>

00:29.614 --> 00:31.950
<i>For he's</i> a <i>jolly good fellow</i>

00:32.116 --> 00:34.118
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

00:34.285 --> 00:36.913
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:39.082
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

00:39.249 --> 00:41.292
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

00:45.421 --> 00:50.510
Oh. Thank you, Chief O'Hara.
But I really don't think I deserve all this.

00:50.677 --> 00:53.513
- Daddy, you're too modest.
-Sure on that, he is.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.722
Right, Mr. Wayne?

00:54.889 --> 00:57.850
The commissioner deserves far more
than we can ever repay.

00:58.017 --> 01:00.520
He's given the best years of his life
to Gotham City.

01:00.687 --> 01:02.647
Where the devil is Mayor Linseed?

01:02.814 --> 01:06.067
He's supposed to present a special award
to the commissioner.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.528
There he is now, with Mrs. Linseed.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.033
They seem to be arguing about something.

01:27.005 --> 01:30.550
Ladies and gentlemen,
as a token of our appreciation...

01:30.717 --> 01:33.636
...for Commissioner Gordon's long service...

01:33.803 --> 01:37.348
...I wish to present him
with this 24-karat gold watch.

01:37.515 --> 01:40.184
- Commissioner.
-Oh, thank you.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.355
And now...

01:45.064 --> 01:48.651
...due to circumstances beyond my control...

01:48.818 --> 01:53.906
...uh, that is, um, due to
overwhelming considerations...

01:55.283 --> 01:58.870
...I hereby discharge Commissioner Gordon.

02:01.873 --> 02:04.751
And in his stead, I appoint...

02:04.917 --> 02:08.880
...as the new police commissioner
of Gotham City...

02:10.214 --> 02:12.091
...Ms. Nora Clavicle.

02:18.723 --> 02:21.225
The famous Nora Clavicle.

02:22.894 --> 02:27.357
I didn't realize her crusade for women
had gone this far.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.401
I'd say she's won that crusade.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.739
Saints preserve us.

02:34.906 --> 02:37.575
Saints preserve us all.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.357
Thank you, Mayor Linseed.

03:53.484 --> 03:54.986
As the new police commissioner...

03:55.153 --> 03:57.989
...I intend to carry on
my crusade for women's rights.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.325
And to prove that women can run
Gotham City better than men.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.327
Much better.

04:04.746 --> 04:08.374
So my first official act
will be to appoint a new police chief.

04:10.752 --> 04:12.086
Mrs. Linseed.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.186
I had no other choice, Mr. Wayne.

04:28.352 --> 04:33.191
My wife is such a devoted follower
of Ms. Clavicle's crusade for women...

04:33.357 --> 04:36.360
...that she refused to cook or clean
or wash my shirts...

04:36.527 --> 04:40.740
...until I appointed Ms. Clavicle
commissioner of police.

04:40.907 --> 04:43.159
I've worn this shirt for a week.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.703
I haven't had a decent meal in months.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.540
It's all right, Mayor Linseed. We understand.

04:51.417 --> 04:52.460
Commissioner...

04:53.461 --> 04:55.797
...can you ever forgive me?

04:56.631 --> 04:59.759
Of course, Mayor Linseed,
I understand how difficult it was for you.

05:00.384 --> 05:04.222
The question is, how difficult
is it going to be for Gotham City?

05:05.932 --> 05:07.308
One moment, sir.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.685
I mean, ma'am.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.938
It's her, sir.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.315
Yes, Ms. Clavicle?

05:14.482 --> 05:16.818
Commissioner Clavicle, Batman...

05:16.984 --> 05:20.238
...calling to tell you
you can take an extended vacation.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.198
We girls are handling things now...

05:22.365 --> 05:24.492
...and we won't need
any help from you men...

05:24.659 --> 05:26.661
...bat or otherwise.

05:26.828 --> 05:29.163
Goodbye, Batman.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.592
Hmm.
There's something curious about this affair.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.553
Very curious, indeed, sir.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.181
Well, we're dressed for investigating,
let's investigate.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.476
There's nothing to investigate yet, Robin.

05:50.643 --> 05:54.689
However, we could take a ride
around Gotham City just in case.

05:54.856 --> 05:58.401
Well, good luck, sir.
We men are counting on you, you know.

05:58.568 --> 06:00.152
Right, Alfred.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.363
To the Batmobile.

06:04.615 --> 06:09.829
<i>NARRATOR". While, in the secret closet
behind Barbara Gordon's bedroom...</i>

06:09.996 --> 06:13.833
<i>...Batgirl has a very similar idea.</i>

06:14.000 --> 06:18.129
<i>But even as she starts
her own investigation...</i>

06:18.296 --> 06:20.506
<i>...what's happening
in Commissioner Gordon 's--</i>

06:20.673 --> 06:23.259
<i>Er, Commissioner Clavicle's office?</i>

06:23.426 --> 06:26.137
Nora, what you're doing is wonderful.

06:26.304 --> 06:29.473
Women will finally take their rightful place
in the world.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.101
Half the credit is yours, Millie dear.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.687
You reorganized the police department.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.024
It was nothing, really.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.233
Nothing?

06:39.400 --> 06:45.281
To fire every man on the police force
and replace them all with women...

06:45.948 --> 06:47.241
...that was quite a job.

06:47.992 --> 06:51.370
Well, I'd better see
that things are running smoothly.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.831
You do that, dear.

07:02.131 --> 07:07.970
Ah. Now that she's out of the way, you girls
may proceed with Operation Ransack...

07:08.137 --> 07:12.516
...while I proceed
with Operation Disaster Insurance.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.269
But what about Batman and Robin, boss?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.981
Those masked menfolk? Pshaw.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.442
And what about Batgirl?

07:21.776 --> 07:24.236
Oh, yes. I forgot about her.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.030
With a woman helping them...

07:26.197 --> 07:29.408
...Batman and Robin might just
give us some trouble.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.871
But all we have to do is make a call
and lead them into a trap.

07:34.038 --> 07:38.292
We, uh, can't call them, boss.
You, uh, cut the wire.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.796
So I did.
But we can still lead them into a trap.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.923
Well, how? How can we find them?

07:44.256 --> 07:46.884
Where does one usually find
Batman and Robin?

07:47.218 --> 07:51.764
Well, usually they're at the scene
of some crime--

07:51.931 --> 07:53.724
Aha.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.312
Heh. Oh, yes, I see what you mean.

08:02.525 --> 08:09.532
<i>Later at the Gotham City Bank, Angelina
and Evelina are making the scene. Of a crime.</i>

08:14.578 --> 08:17.748
Hand over the goodies and don't dawdle.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.482
- Officer!
-Oh!

08:44.025 --> 08:45.693
Now look what you've made me do.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.863
But there's a robbery.

08:49.030 --> 08:51.490
It's all smeared.

08:53.951 --> 08:59.540
Then add a little paprika
and simmer over a little flame for 15 minutes.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.501
- Don't forget the bay leaves.
-And a peppercorn or two.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.836
Thank you. Thank you.

09:04.003 --> 09:08.591
Thank you?
When my bank's just been burgled?

09:08.758 --> 09:11.469
I hadn't thought of bay leaves. Yeah.

09:16.599 --> 09:20.853
Officer, chase them!
They've just robbed my bank!

09:24.190 --> 09:27.151
How can I chase them
when they have the car?

09:27.318 --> 09:31.614
And all I have are my new Givenchy shoes.
And I'm certainly not gonna wreck them.

09:37.912 --> 09:42.541
What's that, Car 6?
A clearance sale at Arbech's?

09:42.708 --> 09:43.751
Ooh!

09:45.294 --> 09:46.837
Calling all cars.

09:47.004 --> 09:52.885
Girls, listen. Arbech's has just marked
all their dresses down 20 percent.

09:53.052 --> 09:57.681
I've been cruising around myself, Batman,
and everything seems to be normal so far.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.434
Don't forget the shoe sale at Dubar's, girls.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.770
Wonderful bargains.

10:02.937 --> 10:04.271
Oh, by the way...

10:04.563 --> 10:07.358
<i>...Gotham National Bank
has just been robbed.</i>

10:07.525 --> 10:11.946
<i>But the big news is the two-for-one sale
at Slob's Drugs.</i>

10:12.196 --> 10:16.158
- Holy bargain basements, Batman.
-Our concern is the bargain hunters...

10:16.325 --> 10:18.577
...at the Gotham National Bank.
-Right, Batman.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.936
Thank goodness you're here, Batman.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.898
Two girl bank robbers just robbed my bank,
while the policewomen did nothing.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.359
Then they took off into thin air
in a getaway car.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.028
Sometimes you can see a great deal
in thin air, sir.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.823
You mean, back to the Batcomputer
in the Batcave, Batman?

10:55.990 --> 10:58.909
No time. We'll use the portable Batcomputer
in the Batmobile.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.744
I think I'll tag along, Batman.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.831
The instruments in the Batgirl-cycle
aren't as sophisticated...

11:03.998 --> 11:06.167
...as those in the Batmobile.
-Thank you.

11:12.173 --> 11:14.592
<i>Following the portable Batcomputer's lead...</i>

11:14.758 --> 11:18.971
...the <i>terrific trio drop in on the warehouse
of Dropstitch & Company...</i>

11:19.138 --> 11:21.432
<i>...manufacturers of fine knitting needles.</i>

11:21.599 --> 11:24.894
<i>But who has the drop on whom?</i>

11:31.150 --> 11:33.360
Don't make a move, Batgirl.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.654
Nor you either, Dynamic Duo.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.865
Holy knit one, purl two.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.617
Exactly, Boy Wonder.

11:39.783 --> 11:44.288
This needle is razor-sharp
and can puncture her jugular vein in an instant.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.540
All right, girls.

11:46.707 --> 11:52.796
Let's tie the terrific trio
into terrific Siamese human knots.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.637
You are wise to stay motionless.

12:00.221 --> 12:02.681
Or you will be the terminated trio.

12:02.848 --> 12:07.561
The slightest move by any one of you
will only draw the human knot tighter.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.230
Crush your bones...

12:11.774 --> 12:14.485
...and strangle you.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.612
Holy hamstrings.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.656
Exactly, Robin.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.783
This is torture...

12:20.950 --> 12:24.495
...at its most bizarre and terrible.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.753
I understand your desire to Checkmate us,
Ms. Clavicle.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.214
Commissioner Clavicle, Batman.

12:35.381 --> 12:38.300
But I strongly suspect
there's more to your scheme...

12:38.467 --> 12:42.221
...than just tying us
in a Siamese human knot.

12:42.388 --> 12:44.682
Very observant, Batman.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.184
And you're right. There is more.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.560
Much more.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.688
As soon as night falls...

12:50.854 --> 12:54.858
...I'm planning to destroy all of Gotham City.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.611
- All of Gotham City?
-Why?

13:01.198 --> 13:03.534
Do you know what this document is,
Batman?

13:03.701 --> 13:08.122
If I dared move my head, I might recognize it.
But I daren't.

13:08.289 --> 13:11.375
It's an insurance policy on Gotham City.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.794
Holy underwritten metropolis.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.297
Exactly, boy bowknot.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.674
I've insured Gotham City
for 10 million dollars.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.218
And what do you think it cost me?

13:21.385 --> 13:23.512
Two hundred dollars, perhaps?

13:23.679 --> 13:26.724
Two hundred dollars
for a 10-million-dollar policy?

13:26.890 --> 13:30.019
Yes, Batgirl. Because the risk is so low.

13:30.185 --> 13:34.440
The chances of destroying
an entire city are infinitesimal.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.234
Right again, Batman.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.903
But Gotham City will be destroyed.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.905
I'll collect the 10 million...

13:42.072 --> 13:44.908
...and there won't be any witnesses around
to make trouble.

13:45.075 --> 13:49.288
Oh, you'll find it completely impossible
to ever get out of that human knot.

13:50.205 --> 13:54.209
But it will all be over soon.

13:54.376 --> 13:58.422
Come on, Evelina. Angelina should be outside
with the truck by now.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.592
Don't move.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.938
Do we dare breathe, Batman?

14:15.105 --> 14:18.525
Cautiously, Robin. Cautiously.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.904
Talking has been dangerous enough.

14:22.613 --> 14:26.658
A deep breath might prove fatal.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.462
Are they all set to go off?
One half hour after sunset?

14:38.629 --> 14:39.671
Yes, boss.

14:39.838 --> 14:43.509
Good. That will give them time
to distribute themselves throughout the city.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.010
And when they explode...

14:45.177 --> 14:48.639
...there won't be a building
left standing in Gotham City.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.686
Oh, they're darling little creatures.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.814
Lovely. Lovely.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.398
I loathe standing in lines, Chief O'Hara.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.484
Well, at least it's only one day a week,
commissioner.

15:42.651 --> 15:46.655
Besides, uh, what else can we do?

15:46.822 --> 15:47.990
Get other jobs.

15:48.157 --> 15:51.034
But we've been policemen
almost all of our lives.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.621
- We don't know how to do anything else.
-True enough, Chief O'Hara.

15:54.788 --> 15:59.209
We only know one trade,
and suddenly that trade is closed to us.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.587
Taken over by women.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.047
Begorra, the shame of it.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.676
I can't stand this much longer, Batman.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.678
I'm getting terrible cramps in my legs.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.513
- Good.
-Good?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.056
Terrible cramps?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.558
Exactly, Robin.

16:14.725 --> 16:18.520
The involuntary muscular contractions
in Batgirl's legs...

16:18.687 --> 16:23.233
...may indirectly relieve the tension
in your lower lumbar region.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.068
Holy slipped disk.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.905
Not quite, Robin.

16:28.071 --> 16:33.660
If I can wiggle my ears...

16:33.827 --> 16:39.124
...and if you are able to bend
the fourth finger...

16:39.458 --> 16:43.795
...on your left hand
just a fraction of an inch...

16:43.962 --> 16:46.298
You might strangle us all.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.926
Release us, Batgirl.

16:49.593 --> 16:54.264
It's the basic formula
for escaping from a Siamese human knot.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.643
I just recalled it. Ready?

16:58.101 --> 17:00.354
- Ready, Robin?
-Ready.

17:02.272 --> 17:06.859
I'm beginning to wiggle my ears
under my cowl.

17:08.237 --> 17:09.946
All right.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.115
Releasing my fourth finger.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.825
I'm wiggling.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.036
I've got it.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.800
Gosh, Batman. What a simple way
to get out of a Siamese human knot.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.426
But what do we do now?

17:31.593 --> 17:33.679
Yes, we really know nothing of Ms.--

17:33.845 --> 17:38.058
Commissioner Clavicle's plan
to destroy Gotham City.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.144
Perhaps we can start with that.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.034
What's inside it?

18:00.122 --> 18:04.626
A high explosive charge
and a timing device.

18:04.793 --> 18:09.423
Apparently set to go off
a half an hour after sunset.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.967
But how could a little charge--?

18:12.134 --> 18:15.304
- Holy mechanical armies.
-Exactly, Robin.

18:15.637 --> 18:20.350
There's a legion of these lethal mice whirring
through Gotham City at this very moment.

18:20.517 --> 18:24.146
- We can't catch them all. Not before dark.
-I know.

18:24.313 --> 18:28.692
Robin, call Chief O'Ha--
Chief Linseed on the police channel.

18:28.859 --> 18:33.363
Tell her to mobilize her entire force
and send them out to gather up these mice.

18:33.530 --> 18:37.492
I'll be back by the time you finish that call.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.878
Connect me with Chief Linseed, please.
It's an emergency.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.087
Chief Linseed?

18:50.213 --> 18:51.673
Yes, Robin?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.760
We know about the mice.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.893
But I'm afraid my police force
won't be very much help to you.

19:03.060 --> 19:07.064
Officer, are those mice still down there?

19:07.230 --> 19:09.107
Yes, Chief Linseed.

19:12.069 --> 19:15.155
Oh, excuse me, Robin,
I'm afraid I'm going to faint.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.240
Me too.

19:23.664 --> 19:27.584
I might have known you can't get policewomen
to help you catch mice.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.294
It's diabolical.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.759
I'm afraid you're right, Robin.
But we may have one last hope.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.596
What are you doing, Batman?
This is no time for games.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.431
Robin, look.

19:47.938 --> 19:50.023
How did you do it, Batman?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.775
There's no time to explain, Robin.

19:51.942 --> 19:55.028
I want you both to play
exactly the same tune that you just heard.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.739
Batgirl, you take the east side,
Robin, take west side.

19:57.906 --> 20:01.201
East side, west side. I'll go through midtown.
We'll meet at the docks.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.079
- But--
-Just play, Robin.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.623
Play for all you're worth.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.546
<i>NARRATOR".
With only moments left before disaster...</i>

20:54.713 --> 20:57.674
<i>...the terrific trio
and their retinue of rodents...</i>

20:57.841 --> 21:00.343
<i>...arrive at dockside.</i>

22:09.788 --> 22:11.540
We made it.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.959
With very few moments to spare.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.253
But how did you know they'd follow us,
Batman?

22:16.628 --> 22:20.549
I was able to determine
that the guidance systems in the mice...

22:20.715 --> 22:23.426
...was built around the principle
of high-frequency radar.

22:23.593 --> 22:27.180
So by selecting the right combination
of flute toots...

22:27.347 --> 22:31.184
...I was able to cause those mice
and their homing mechanisms...

22:31.351 --> 22:35.897
...to zero in on the source of the sounds:
the flutes.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.149
The pied pipers of Gotham City.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.278
You might say that.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.459
I see you have
some interesting freight there.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.629
That we do, Batman.
Caught them at the edge of town.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.007
Just as you said we might
when you phoned me.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.302
They were exceeding the speed limit
by a considerable margin, sir...

23:05.468 --> 23:07.804
...so we thought it best
to take them into custody.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.682
You can't arrest us. You have no power.

23:10.849 --> 23:14.436
Citizen's arrest, me fine-feathered females.
Heh.

23:14.603 --> 23:17.355
You should have bought
some prison insurance, Ms. Clavicle.

23:17.522 --> 23:21.526
She'll need it where she's going,
Boy Wonder. A long-term policy...

23:21.693 --> 23:24.070
...with Warden Crichton as the beneficiary.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.699
It'll be nice to have our old jobs backs again,
won't it, commissioner?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.829
It will indeed, Chief O'Hara. It will indeed.

23:38.293 --> 23:41.338
Well, with Nora Clavicord behind bars--

23:41.504 --> 23:44.507
- Chief O'Hara, that's Clavicle.
-Oh.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.636
Well, a rose by any other name,
commissioner.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.346
And what a rose she was.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.514
With Mrs. Linseed under her thumb...

23:51.681 --> 23:53.850
...and all those exploding mice
under her feet.

23:54.017 --> 23:58.521
Yes. At least she didn't pull it off.
Thanks to Batman, Robin and Batgirl.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.483
Do you think we'll have a breather now,
commissioner?

24:01.650 --> 24:05.403
Oh, unless we get some disturbing phone call,
Chief O'Hara.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.406
Commissioner Gordon.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.242
Penguin?

24:11.785 --> 24:13.954
Just let me ask you one thing,
commissioner.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.041
Did you ever hear
of the lethal Lygerian fruit fly?

24:24.381 --> 24:28.927
<i>NARRATOR". And Commissioner Gordon
certainly will hear of lethal Lygerian fruit flies.</i>

24:29.094 --> 24:34.391
<i>And so shall we all when Penguin
pulls his insidious insect antic...</i>

24:34.557 --> 24:36.810
<i>...in our next episode.</i>
