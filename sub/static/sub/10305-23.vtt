00:03.240 --> 00:08.268
<i>Dear Starla,
how are things in solitary?</i>

00:09.600 --> 00:13.388
<i>Is it true that they throw you
in the hole nak ed?</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:19.073
<i>Anxiously awaiting your reply, Bud.</i>

00:19.880 --> 00:23.156
Daddy, I love Lonnie.
And I'll die if I can't have him.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.875
Suit yourself.
A funeral's cheaper than a wedding.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.675
Dad, don't worry. Kelly can't wait
for Lonnie to get out of prison.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.316
I mean, she cheats on a guy
if he takes too long in the bathroom.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.555
Good point, son.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.036
Besides, he's a vicious criminal.
They probably locked him up for life.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.276
They turned me loose.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.631
They said the prison
was too overcrowded.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.469
God forbid prisoners don't
have enough legroom.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.036
Oh, look how much he loves her.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.719
The man just got out of prison.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.673
He'd be happy kissing anything
without stubble.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.953
Sir, I have come to ask
for your daughter's hand.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.434
Is that all?

01:03.640 --> 01:07.872
Yeah, why stop there?
No one else does.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.756
Sir, I may not be the smartest man
in the world or the most successful...

01:12.960 --> 01:16.236
...but I love your daughter
and I would give my life for her.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.429
Deal.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.871
Dad, what are you doing?
Get your hands-!

01:22.840 --> 01:24.592
He tried to strangle me.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.349
Well, that's just how
we show affection.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.275
Hey, Mom.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.955
Do you see that shade of blue
that Dad's turning?

01:38.160 --> 01:41.516
Don't you think that would be a good
colour for the bridesmaids' dresses?

01:42.200 --> 01:45.397
Actually, I was thinking
a little more purple-y.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.111
There, that's it.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.794
Oh, speaking of the wedding,
I almost forgot.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.629
Kelly, this is for you.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.990
That is the biggest cubic zirconia
I've ever seen.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.237
Genuine cubic zirconia? Oh, Lonnie.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.395
Oh, my God.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.038
You stole my daughter
an engagement ring...

02:17.240 --> 02:19.959
...and it's not even a real diamond?

02:22.200 --> 02:23.553
Sir, I love Kelly very much...

02:23.760 --> 02:27.070
...and I promise you, she'll be
very happy as Mrs. Lonnie Tot.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.836
Wait a second.
Did you say your name was Tot?

02:34.040 --> 02:36.076
I don't know. Did I?

02:37.360 --> 02:41.273
Tot, as in the Tots,
owner of Tot Industries...

02:41.480 --> 02:44.790
...maker of Weenie Tots,
nature's most perfect food?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.388
Yeah, that's us.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.390
Al, Al. This ring is real.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.838
- Son!
- Dad!

03:37.200 --> 03:39.998

03:40.200 --> 03:44.591
...but you get free cheques
and a SaladShooter.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.352
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.394
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.398
I love you both.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.949
Kelly. Kelly.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.957
Kelly.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.909
Hey, isn't that Big Bird?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.712
- Where?
- Where?

04:07.360 --> 04:08.873
You missed him.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.958
Now, Kelly, honey,
on this very special occasion...

04:12.160 --> 04:16.870
...I want you to wear the dress that
I wore on the happiest day of my life.

04:17.079 --> 04:20.072
Unfortunately,
the football team kept it.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.873
But I do have my wedding dress.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.390
And it is very nice too.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.477
Gee, Mom, it's...

04:31.040 --> 04:31.995
What is it?

04:32.200 --> 04:36.910
Genuine snow leopard.
Isn't it stunning?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.079
Peggy, as the wedding coordinator...

04:42.280 --> 04:46.558
...may I suggest
something a little less whorish?

04:48.320 --> 04:49.355
Oh, come on, Kelly.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.516
We better go colour
our wedding invitations.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.631
- Dibs on magenta!
- Dibs on magenta!

04:56.280 --> 05:00.034
My God.
Their children will be rutabagas.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.392
Yeah, it's possible.
Root vegetables run in my family.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.079
Now, about the wedding dinner.

05:06.280 --> 05:11.149
I was thinking an open bar,
hors d'oeuvres and six courses.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.275
Yeah, well, Al was thinking
a cash bar and a cover charge.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.153
Well, that's what we're planning
for his funeral.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.398
Thanks.

05:29.600 --> 05:34.390
I can't believe how cheap they are.
They got me a bowl with holes in it.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.115
Honey, don't be silly.
That's not a bowl.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.958
It's a hat.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.156
Oh, okay.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.157
Yeah! Thanks.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.636
Kelly,
you really shouldn't be wearing that.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.668
Oh, yeah, right. Bad luck, huh?

05:56.120 --> 06:00.033
Anyway, you know, it's so nice
of you guys to give me this shower...

06:00.240 --> 06:02.549
...and I wanna give something to you.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.759
My little black book.

06:14.600 --> 06:20.072
Johnny Parker, David Petrocelli,
Max Pullman.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.635
Hey, that name sounds familiar.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.637
That's your father.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.672
And Mr. Owens,
our chemistry teacher?

06:30.880 --> 06:34.156
Yeah, well, I passed, didn't I?

06:36.480 --> 06:40.996
I love Lonnie so much that
it's worth giving up all those guys.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.755
Even page 41.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.359
You know, honey, I never wanted
another man after I met your father.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.269
Every time he would look at me,
I'd get butterflies in my stomach.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.232
Well, does that still happen?

06:56.440 --> 07:00.479
Well, now it's more like a churning.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.389
But at least
something's going on down there.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.477
You guys are still in love, aren't you?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.113
Absolutely.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.995
You know, after 25 years,
we may not be as lovey-dovey...

07:11.200 --> 07:13.111
...but at least two times a year...

07:13.320 --> 07:17.757
...your father makes me feel
like a teenager all over again.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.428
That's because he has no money
and a bad car.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.312
True, but he's still
my Prince Charming.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.229
Behold the power of Beercules.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.032
Damn, you've blown
a lot of dough, Al.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.677
I've never seen you buy a drink,
even for yourself.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.358
Well, when you're part of one
of America's wealthiest families...

07:49.560 --> 07:51.994
...it's your responsibility
to show a little class.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.351
Hey, Cheez Doodles for everyone,
the puffy kind.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.876
No one listens, just like at home.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.510
Some guy must have
more money than you.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.871
Who'd have more money
than a Tot-in-law?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.910
A Tot in heat.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.240
Hey. What are you doing here?

08:15.440 --> 08:18.591
Dad, I'm here every Friday night.
I can't believe I've never seen you.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.116
Oh, well, Friday is full-price night.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.992
But I'm surprised at you,
a soon-to-be-married man.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.760
Well, you're here, Dad,
and you've been married, what...

08:28.960 --> 08:30.757
...50, 60 years?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.239
At least.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.749
Yeah, but that's my whole point.
I've earned it.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.155
See, your future wife
deserves more respect.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.587
Well, what about your wife?

08:39.799 --> 08:44.430
That's different. My wife is my wife,
and your wife is my daughter.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.312
Get out.
Don't let me catch you again.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.559
- But I already paid for a lap dance.
- Don't worry, I'll put it to good use.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.670
The sacrifices I make for this family.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.832
Oh, Al, we got a welcome-to-the-family
present from the Tots.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.476
Remind me to send them
a go-to-hell thank-you card.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.717
There will be no wedding, Peg.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.516
I saw our former future son-in-law
tonight at the nudie bar.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.278
He's a dog, Peg.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.155
Al, you go to the nudie bar all the
time and you don't cheat on me.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.670
That's right, because I show
the nudie bar its due respect.

09:28.880 --> 09:33.351
A man looks, drools, dreams,
but does not cheat.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.109
Technically,
they're not even married yet.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.914
They're engaged,
and that's the same thing.

09:39.240 --> 09:44.234
An engagement ring is circular.
It means "out of circulation. "

09:46.160 --> 09:48.833
Well, it's all hooked up.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.554
Dad, did you see our gift
that our new in-laws sent us?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.955
They're not going to be our in-laws.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.716
You lie.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.515
Your father thinks
that Lonnie's cheating on Kelly.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.590
Mom, Dad...

10:03.800 --> 10:08.157
...there's a rumour floating around town
that Kelly herself is no longer a virgin.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.511
A rumour that's been
a- floating since '79.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.274
I know that Kelly has sown
a few wild oats...

10:16.480 --> 10:19.153
...among God knows
what other things.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.669
But I cannot knowingly allow
my pumpkin...

10:21.880 --> 10:24.269
...to marry a rogue and a scoundrel.

10:24.480 --> 10:30.510
He's not, Dad. He can't be.
He's a Tot. Tots are good people.

10:30.720 --> 10:36.317
Would bad people send us
a gift like this?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.114
What is it?

10:38.320 --> 10:41.517
It's a big-screen projector, Dad.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.590
Isn't that worth the small sacrifice
that we laughingly call Kelly?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.392
No, Bud, your dad's right.

10:49.600 --> 10:55.709
<i>We can't sacrifice our only daughter's
happiness, even for a big-screen TV.</i>

10:55.920 --> 10:59.356
Exactly. How big?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.595
It's 10 feet wide, Dad.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.232
Ten feet?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.519
And they sent over
a LaserDisc player too...

11:08.720 --> 11:12.156
...with a movie, Dad,
a John Wayne movie.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.518
The Duke?

11:15.800 --> 11:19.873
Well, I'm sorry. They're just
going to have to send it back.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.150
Let's not lose our heads here, Dad.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.874
Now, do you have any proof
of your accusations?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.798
Well, no.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.357
Shame, Dad. Shame, shame, shame.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.838
You know, Bud's right, Al.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.271
Well, I'm not sure.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.355
Let's just ask the Duke.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.830
My Lord in heaven.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.678
Oh, I've seen this one.

11:51.880 --> 11:56.317
This is where the Duke kills a bunch of
Indians who are really asking for it.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.432
Hello, family.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.755
Look who's here.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.032
Kelly, I think Dad has something
he'd like to say to you.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.596
- What is it, Daddy?
- Kelly...

12:12.880 --> 12:15.075
Kelly, go to your room.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.909
All of you, go to your rooms.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.869
Friend of the bride.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.355
Friend of the bride.
I think you know where to sit.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.234
<i>Wedding video,
Kelly's First Marriage.</i>

12:45.040 --> 12:48.430
<i>Un film de Jefferson D'Arcy.</i>

12:51.280 --> 12:54.955
Yes. Luckily, I have my bazoom lens.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.670
There's the villain of our little story.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.315
Al, I don't see
any of my relatives here.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.956
- Didn't you send out the invitations?
- Well, of course I did, pookie.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.271
Hey, hey,
what do you got there, boy?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.713
Al, Peggy,
I'd like you to meet the Tots.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.273
I've just been telling them...

13:24.480 --> 13:29.031
...about the wonderful investment
opportunities at Kyoto National Bank.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.430
There's a line to kiss their ass,
and it starts behind me.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.918
So while you're back there,
why don't you kiss mine too?

13:40.560 --> 13:42.391
Enjoy the wedding.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.876
- Hi. I'm Earl Tot.
- And I'm Pearl Tot.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.911
And I'm Al Bundy.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.918
- Who's this pretty little creature?
- Where?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.715
This creature. Well, this here's Peg.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.192
You have such a lovely home.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.392
It reminds me of when we started out.

14:00.600 --> 14:06.470
Earl had nothing but 2 pounds of cow
lips, a bucket of nitrates and a dream.

14:06.920 --> 14:11.311
You know, that's funny. Al had all that.
Except for the dream.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.636
And the bucket.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.638
Well, just being here
just brings tears to my eyes.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.035
Al, I told you to close your hamper.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.553
So, Lonnie, tell me again.
What does your sister look like?

14:25.760 --> 14:29.275
Well, kind of like her,
but with bigger waloobies.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.713
I think we may just be related twice.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.275
Oh, Mama, Daddy, this is Bud.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.995
Remember? He's the one I told you
would be perfect for Tatum.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.598
Here's my little sugar bear now.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.918
- Lonnie!
- Tatum!

14:49.920 --> 14:52.559
I thought you said
she had big waloobies.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.719
Oh, she does. In my family, waloobies
is a pet name for butt cheeks.

14:58.560 --> 15:03.076
You're right, Lonnie. He's a cutie-pie.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.838
Now, don't they make
a darling couple?

15:10.360 --> 15:13.830
She makes a darling couple
all by herself.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.318
Al, if we can get both our kids hitched,
I'd have to make you a partner.

15:19.880 --> 15:24.078
Attention, everyone. I would like to
announce the engagement of my son.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.800
Damn you, Dad.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.751
Come on, people.
We have a wedding to do.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.234
Al, go check on the bride.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.036
And remember, when you walk
down the aisle, try to walk upright.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.879
No problem.
I only double over when I see you.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.709
Oh, Marcy. I have more butterflies now
than I did for my own wedding.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.591
I would have thought you would have
been nauseous for your wedding.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.789
Well, I was that too.
But that was from morning sickness.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.189
Hey, Peg, you look great.
Can I take you out now?

16:00.240 --> 16:03.755
Griff, we have a wedding to go to.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.350
But you can call me tomorrow.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.749
I was talking about
taking you to your seat.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.119
Sure.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.076
Now, where is my best man
and my maid of honour?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.955
Oh, God! The horror! The horror!

16:24.160 --> 16:27.789
Come back here
and let me finish that hickey!

16:30.240 --> 16:33.471
She moves a lot faster
since she lost all that weight.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.236
Oh, here. Let me help you with that.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.876
Okay, that's good.
Gee, you look very handsome.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.550
Well, thank you, Mrs. D'Arcy.
You look handsome too.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.074
- Pretty.
- Well, thank you again.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.271
You look pretty too.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.195
Listen, Lonnie.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.676
I want you to know that I wanna be
more than just your banker.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.108
I wanna be your friend.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.756
So if you ever need or want anything,
I'm available.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.996
Well, that's good,
because I gotta tell you...

17:02.200 --> 17:06.990
...there's something about a little
bony banker that really turns me on.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.590
What are you, crazy?
You're about to get married.

17:14.079 --> 17:18.278
That'll only take about 10 minutes.
What are you doing after?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.316
Not you.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.511
Your sister looks beautiful, Bud.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.712
The white dress is a bit of a stretch.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.074
It wouldn't be on me.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.999
No, I think it would be.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.229
Dearly beloved...

17:58.440 --> 18:02.877
...we are gathered together to join
this man and woman in holy matrimony.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.593
And if anyone can show just cause
why they may not be joined together...

18:07.800 --> 18:10.917
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.117
Okay, that's it. This wedding's off.

18:15.800 --> 18:21.079
Well, good. I still have time to make
the Edelstein funeral.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.795
Daddy, you're ruining my wedding.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.515
He's ruining your wedding.
How dare you?

18:27.720 --> 18:29.790
How dare he what?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.993
I now have proof that
this no-good idiot jailbird...

18:34.200 --> 18:37.909
...while coming from a fine,
upstanding weenie family...

18:38.200 --> 18:40.191
...is a two-timing snake.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.435
Hear, hear.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.713
What are you yammering about?
Our son has done nothing wrong.

18:45.920 --> 18:51.438
Your boy, madam,
who I like to refer to as Dummard...

18:51.840 --> 18:54.274
...is still hitting on
good-looking women.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.549
Thanks, Al.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.797
And on top of all that, he just
hit on one who looks like a man.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.994
Is that all? Lonnie here is just-
Oh, you know. -fickle.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.270
Sure. Who cares?

19:08.680 --> 19:09.908
Well, I care.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.475
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.193
Well, now that I think about it,
it kind of upset my other wives too.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.677
Your other wives? His other wives?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.917
Yeah, well, I said he was fickle.
All of us Tots are.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.111
I've been married five times myself.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.788
And I got a boyfriend.

19:34.320 --> 19:38.359
So that's the kind of lowlife scum
you people are.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.439
No respect for the torturous
sanctity of marriage.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.631
Well, let me tell you something.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.149
We Bundys may have our faults-

19:47.360 --> 19:49.396
- Oh, yeah.
- You said it.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.751
- but we believe that marriage
should be forever.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.349
No matter how pitiful
or disgusting it may be...

19:55.560 --> 19:58.870
...to wake up to the same
horrifying face each day...

19:59.080 --> 20:01.992
...that's what the marriage vows
are all about.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.637
And anyone who can't stand
the nagging, bonbon-eating heat...

20:06.840 --> 20:11.152
...should stay out of the
whining, sex-starved kitchen.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.516
You tell them, Al.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.510
Mom, he just called you
fat and whiny.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.191
Well, I just heard the part
about staying out of the kitchen.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.391
Lonnie, we do not have to take this.
We are Tots.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.230
Gee, I'm sorry, Kelly. Are you sure
you don't wanna be a Tot?

20:31.440 --> 20:33.670
You know,
I never thought I'd ever say this...

20:33.880 --> 20:36.440
<i>...but right now,
I'd rather be a Bundy. So:</i>

20:41.960 --> 20:42.949
Thanks, Dad.

20:43.520 --> 20:48.833
There went my last chance
at unlimited wealth. Unless...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.116
I just can't do it.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.278
Are you okay, honey?

20:57.760 --> 21:02.197
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, I'm gonna miss Lonnie...

21:02.400 --> 21:05.472
...but at least I have something
that'll always remind me of him.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.672
A $10,000 wedding debt?

21:09.400 --> 21:12.597
No, Daddy, that's yours.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.551
I've got this.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.196
And, of course,
my loved ones to console me.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.313
We're here for you, Kel.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.511
Not you.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.998
Them.
