<i>(Overton)</i>
<i>Previously on "Living Single."</i>

00:03.336 --> 00:06.272
This is the ring I designed
for my Synclaire.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.708
Oh, you designed it.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.443
It's like no other engagement
ring you ever seen.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.978
Russell, what are you
doin' here?

00:12.045 --> 00:15.181
Well, I was in the neighborhood
and we're being sued for libel.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.683
What?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.686
Remember my article on that
new band, Belching Yams?

00:19.753 --> 00:21.988
I wrote there could be
no denying their song

00:22.055 --> 00:25.025
"Everybody has a Nipple"

00:25.091 --> 00:28.361
was a rip off of
Barry Manilow's "Mandy."

00:28.428 --> 00:31.397
Well, it seems
there's some denyin' it.

00:31.464 --> 00:33.867
The Borough Alderman elections
are being held next month

00:33.934 --> 00:38.705
and the incumbent Paul Malaba
has been a disaster.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.274
Will you carry the torch
of democracy for us?

00:42.275 --> 00:44.177
Sure.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.480
(all)
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

00:47.548 --> 00:50.483
And Regine! And Regine!

00:50.551 --> 00:53.319
You gotta focus on the,
on your good points, you know.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.957
Focus on things like, what good
taste you have in women.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.425
You delicate flower.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.234
I didn't know you cared!

01:13.446 --> 01:16.683
Gimme all your valuable stuff

Overton, give that man
anything he wants.

01:20.587 --> 01:22.823
Thanks, brother.
Whoo!

01:26.927 --> 01:28.428
I'll be right back, Synclaire.

01:28.494 --> 01:31.532

I love you.

your waitress.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.076
Can I get you some coffee.

02:10.143 --> 02:11.311
or perhaps some cheese

02:11.377 --> 02:12.478
or some cake?

02:12.546 --> 02:14.548
Maybe some coffee cheese cake?
Maybe some‐‐

02:14.615 --> 02:16.282
Synclaire, you have
gone from trippin'

02:16.349 --> 02:18.217
to a full vacation.

02:19.553 --> 02:22.022
Now, honey, please,
sit down, okay.

02:22.088 --> 02:23.456
The police said
that they would call

02:23.524 --> 02:24.925
as soon as they heard anything.

02:24.991 --> 02:26.259
No‐no, I've got to stay
in character

02:26.326 --> 02:27.694
to keep my mind off Obie.

02:27.761 --> 02:30.330
Uh, so what will it be, miss?

02:30.396 --> 02:32.766
Alright, I'll have a large
nonfat milk.

02:32.833 --> 02:36.202
Um‐hm, one tall Kate Moss.

02:37.938 --> 02:40.340
White and skinny.

[doorbell ringing]

02:41.642 --> 02:42.843
[Synclaire mumbling]

02:44.678 --> 02:47.347
‐ Oh, Obie, thank God!
‐ Hey!

02:47.413 --> 02:49.215
‐ Hey!
‐ There you are, you okay?

02:49.282 --> 02:50.383
I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:50.450 --> 02:51.417
I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:51.484 --> 02:53.319
Everybody this is
Officer Solis.

02:53.386 --> 02:56.523
‐ NYPD..
‐ Okay.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.891
Mounted unit.

03:01.668 --> 03:03.570
I was so worried, what happened?
Tell me everything‐‐

03:03.637 --> 03:06.139
Look‐look‐look, if‐if you people
don't keep it down

03:06.206 --> 03:09.843
somebody's gonna call
the poli.. See.

03:12.178 --> 03:14.480
Kyle, we were mugged
in Central Park.

03:14.548 --> 03:17.017
‐ No, man!
‐ Yeah!

03:17.083 --> 03:19.620
And I took off after the mugger
on horseback.

03:19.686 --> 03:23.123
Let me tell you, nothin' like
riding a horse at full gallop

03:23.189 --> 03:25.626
hooves pounding,
leather slappin'

03:25.692 --> 03:28.762
me wishin' I would've wore
my athletic supporter.

03:30.564 --> 03:32.566
Yeah, and then the horse
caught up with the mugger

03:32.633 --> 03:34.267
held him down for the cops.

03:34.334 --> 03:37.838
With our job done she just kinda
dumped me off in the rosebush.

03:37.904 --> 03:39.640
Mr. Jones was so ensnarled

03:39.706 --> 03:43.309
we had to use the pruning
sheers of life.

03:48.982 --> 03:52.018
Well, did you find
the man's valuables?

03:52.085 --> 03:56.189
Oh, nearly lost my valuables
ridin' the damn horse.

03:56.256 --> 03:57.991
All we found on the suspect
was a handgun

03:58.058 --> 04:01.167
but we're searching
the area, little lady.

04:01.234 --> 04:03.904
Oh, it's good to know
the posse is on it, horse.

04:06.072 --> 04:07.641
That never fails.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.076
The equestrian police,
we get no respect.

04:10.143 --> 04:12.713
I'm sure any cop can lock
himself up inside a cruiser

04:12.779 --> 04:13.880
and call for backup.

04:13.947 --> 04:15.215
But me,
I'm out there every night

04:15.281 --> 04:17.684
puttin' my horse's ass
on the line.

04:19.418 --> 04:23.423
Well, Obie, you've had
a terrible, terrible time.

04:23.489 --> 04:27.561
Just glad the night's not over
yet, my electric horseman.

04:27.628 --> 04:30.396
Well, uh, that's where
you're wrong, my beloved

04:30.463 --> 04:32.065
'cause if I don't
get some rest soon

04:32.132 --> 04:35.669
I may never be able
to saddle up again.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.572
And if I don't
get my eight hours

04:38.638 --> 04:40.574
I'll look like
the average man.

04:43.376 --> 04:44.444
[whispering]
Come here.

04:44.511 --> 04:46.112
So‐so‐so, listen, man,
did the mugger get the,

04:46.179 --> 04:47.548
get the ring? Oh!

04:47.614 --> 04:49.716
Man, I didn't get a chance
to pop the question?

04:49.783 --> 04:52.385
Damn. Well‐well, look, let's go
back to the park, man

04:52.452 --> 04:53.453
and look for it.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.389
Kyle, Central Park,
2:00 a. m.?

04:56.456 --> 04:58.124
You'll be killed.

04:59.526 --> 05:00.493
Well, good.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.735
Have you seen the evening news?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.437
I'm practically the running mate
of Maverick Max

05:04.505 --> 05:05.706
the nympho candidate.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.608
Ugh.

05:07.674 --> 05:08.909
Kinda ironic.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.913
I can't get with Synclaire
and you can't get away from Max.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.783
I guess into each life
a little rain must fall.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.251
Well, sure, he gets sprinkles.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.386
I get Hurricane Maxine.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.291
Come on, Khadijah,
we're gonna be late.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.593
I'm not goin' in today.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.194
Max is bringin' over
a liable lawyer

05:28.261 --> 05:30.030
to talk about this
Belching Yams lawsuit.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.599
And I do not want the staff to
know how much trouble we're in.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.401
Great, then I can stay home
and watch TV.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.871
Rosie O'Donnell
is interviewing Oprah

05:37.938 --> 05:39.773
and then they're gonna switch.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.676
You are goin' into
the office

05:42.743 --> 05:45.411
and act as if
nothing is wrong.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.915
Ah, so everyone will think
everything's normal.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.450
Well, not normal,
but, you know

05:50.517 --> 05:52.252
the way things are
when you around.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.921
Oh, I'm on it, chief.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.456
[doorbell ringing]

06:00.834 --> 06:03.970
Hello, Khadijah.
Synclaire.

06:04.037 --> 06:05.471
What lawsuit?

06:09.843 --> 06:10.811
Max and her friend
aren't here yet.

06:10.877 --> 06:12.445
Just have a seat,
I'll be right back.

06:16.382 --> 06:19.252
So, Khadijah,
when did we get a doggy door?

06:19.319 --> 06:22.055
Don't worry, depressed
under D cup.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.925
I'm here to see Khadijah.

06:24.991 --> 06:26.960
We're tryin' to save
the magazine.

06:27.027 --> 06:28.328
Oh!

06:29.530 --> 06:30.797
[sighs]

06:33.800 --> 06:36.402
On the other hand
to hell with "Flavor."

06:38.805 --> 06:40.340
Alright, listen,
I've been thinkin'.

06:40.406 --> 06:44.344
And, I want us to agree
that what happened last night

06:44.410 --> 06:46.012
never happened.

06:47.848 --> 06:49.049
Agreed!

06:49.115 --> 06:51.652
What are we talkin' about?

06:51.718 --> 06:53.820
Oh, that's excellent.

06:53.887 --> 06:57.558
You see, no one has
to ever know about the kiss.

06:58.525 --> 06:59.660
Oh.

06:59.726 --> 07:01.935
Oh, that.

07:02.002 --> 07:04.404
Yeah, I‐I know
it won't be easy.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.006
No problem at all.

07:07.407 --> 07:10.777
Though you have to admit
it was some kiss.

07:10.844 --> 07:13.514
Like a thousand others.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.649
Oh, get off it, Russell.

07:15.716 --> 07:18.752
Now, you know damn well that
there was a spark in that kiss.

07:18.819 --> 07:21.655
A‐a‐a volatile chemistry,
pure passion!

07:21.722 --> 07:24.658
I've forgotten all about it
and you better do the same!

07:26.927 --> 07:28.194
Just the way I like her.

07:28.261 --> 07:30.263
Chesty and testy.

07:31.231 --> 07:32.332
[doorbell ringing]

07:35.401 --> 07:38.004
Khadijah James.
Del Stuart.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.610
Del is a great liable lawyer and
the best negotiator in the city.

07:43.677 --> 07:45.311
Would you like some coffee?

07:45.378 --> 07:46.647
Espresso.

07:46.713 --> 07:49.049
I don't have espresso,
how about some regular coffee?

07:49.115 --> 07:51.652
‐ Drip?
‐ Yes.

07:51.718 --> 07:54.320
Alright. I'll accept the drip
if you throw in an Oreo.

07:56.422 --> 07:58.491
No name chocolate
sandwich cookie.

08:00.226 --> 08:02.569
You're lucky I'm in
a good mood.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.606
Look‐look, I can't stay.
I gotta go, I gotta go, girl.

08:05.672 --> 08:08.408
I gotta go dig up
some dirt on Paul Malaba.

08:08.474 --> 08:11.778
Regine! You are
my campaign manager.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.046
Can you manage to
help me with this?

08:13.113 --> 08:15.616
No, dear,
ex‐campaign manager.

08:15.682 --> 08:17.651
See, because of you
my woman's group has

08:17.718 --> 08:20.721
pulled their endorsement
and shunned me.

08:20.787 --> 08:22.322
Just because of
a little heat.

08:22.388 --> 08:25.792
Uh, Max, I would not
call it a little heat.

08:25.859 --> 08:29.963
When Playboy offers you $5000
to be in their photo spread

08:30.030 --> 08:33.366
"Ladies Of
The Immoral Majority."

08:33.433 --> 08:35.135
Well, if they don't make the
five grand

08:35.201 --> 08:36.135
and Adopt‐A‐Highway

08:36.202 --> 08:38.138
I'd be stupid
not to do it.

08:39.573 --> 08:41.808
Uh, remember you can
see them

08:41.875 --> 08:43.610
they can't see you.

08:51.852 --> 08:53.754
Speak as you were instructed.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.990
Um, give me all
your valuable stuff

08:57.057 --> 08:59.760
or you're dead.

08:59.826 --> 09:03.403
Give me all your valuable stuff
or you're dead.

09:05.872 --> 09:08.575
I say, give me
all your valuable stuff

09:08.642 --> 09:11.377
or I'll give you
the old "what for?"

09:11.444 --> 09:14.314
Don't be a wise guy,
number three.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.250
Gimme all your valuable stuff
or you're dead.

09:17.317 --> 09:18.785
That's him!
That's the guy!

09:18.852 --> 09:20.086
(Synclaire)
'Oh, Obie, are you positive?'

09:20.153 --> 09:21.487
Yeah, I know,
that's him. I'm positive.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.824
‐ Him. That guy!
‐ Good.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.326
You..

09:26.392 --> 09:28.328
[gabbering]

09:29.963 --> 09:32.398
Ohh! Get me at him!
Get me at him!

09:32.465 --> 09:34.200
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

09:34.267 --> 09:37.470
But you don't know what kind of
life I've had, lady.

09:37.538 --> 09:39.472
Abandoned by my mom and dad.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.074
Raised in an orphanage.

09:41.141 --> 09:45.311
Fed nothing but one stinking
bowl of gruel a day.

09:45.378 --> 09:48.549
And then I fell in
with a band of pickpockets.

09:48.615 --> 09:50.416
I remember Fagan.
He led a‐‐

09:50.483 --> 09:54.120
Oh, bro, that's "Oliver Twist."

09:54.187 --> 09:55.522
I knew it sounded familiar.

09:55.589 --> 10:00.126
Get me at him! Get me at him!
I'll tear you limb for limb!

10:00.193 --> 10:03.069
Oh, Obie, I'm mad.
I'm mad, you see!

10:07.207 --> 10:08.542
Alright, Khadijah.

10:08.609 --> 10:12.879
I have evaluated the lawsuit
from every conceivable angle

10:12.946 --> 10:15.248
and I've arrived
at a studied conclusion.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.282
Break it down for me.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.851
Certainly.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.185
You lose.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.622
[sighs]
Isn't there anything
we can do?

10:21.688 --> 10:22.923
Yeah, settle outta court

10:22.989 --> 10:26.192
and, uh, as a gesture
of good faith, fire Russell.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.329
You're fired. Uh‐huh.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.133
I know how hard
that was for you.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.504
But there's no need
to fire me. I'll quit.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.973
Alright, now, I want you
to meet with the Yams

10:40.040 --> 10:42.909
and their attorney right here,
it'll make you seem warm

10:42.976 --> 10:44.611
human, that kind of crap.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.479
‐ I can pull that off.
‐ Excellent. Excellent.

10:46.547 --> 10:49.783
Alright, I guess I can get
the Yams to walk away

10:49.850 --> 10:53.554
from this for, uh,
little as $10,000.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.188
Ten Gs.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.723
Where am I supposed
to get that?

10:56.790 --> 11:00.466
I presume the same place
you're getting my $5000 fee.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.336
Well, then that's it.

11:03.403 --> 11:04.671
Whether we got to court
or settle

11:04.738 --> 11:06.072
that's the end of "Flavor."

11:06.139 --> 11:08.074
It's a bitter pill.

11:10.811 --> 11:12.513
Khadijah, I don't know what to
say. I wish there was‐‐

11:12.579 --> 11:13.847
Tsk, forget it, Russell.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.883
It's not the end
of the world.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.285
I can deal with it.

11:19.352 --> 11:21.888
I guess I just gotta be strong.

11:23.690 --> 11:25.058
[crying]

11:25.125 --> 11:27.828
Alright. Alright.

11:27.894 --> 11:29.830
Wait, it's your fault.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.673
Hm.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.809
I guess this was a little
self‐indulgent.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.077
Shee.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.347
Oh, God!

11:48.682 --> 11:51.084
Hey, been tryin' to reach you
for over an hour.

11:51.151 --> 11:52.786
Your phone's not workin'.

11:52.853 --> 11:54.888
I got tired of talkin'
to reporters about

11:54.955 --> 11:57.724
Paul Malaba's
latest allegation.

11:57.791 --> 11:59.325
What, did they find out
about the time we went

11:59.392 --> 12:01.067
to the stock exchange
and you said that

12:01.134 --> 12:02.936
my Dow Jones
was more than average?

12:03.003 --> 12:05.238
[chuckles]

12:05.305 --> 12:07.207
No.

12:07.273 --> 12:09.676
He made up some wild story
that I was seen nude

12:09.743 --> 12:12.145
at some costume party
in 1991.

12:14.915 --> 12:16.717
I was dressed as Nero.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.985
You try cinching up a toga with
a beer in one hand

12:19.052 --> 12:21.387
and a stogie in the other.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.957
Hey, you know the real tragedy
is that my name has been

12:24.024 --> 12:25.258
linked to yours
in the media.

12:25.325 --> 12:28.695
‐ Oh, you slimy piece of‐‐
‐ Oh, ja, va, ja, hush.

12:30.597 --> 12:32.065
Now, you need to know
that I am working

12:32.132 --> 12:33.867
a Wall Street contact

12:33.934 --> 12:36.302
who has evidence
of Malaba's misuse

12:36.369 --> 12:37.771
of government funds.

12:37.838 --> 12:39.039
For real?

12:39.105 --> 12:41.908
I'm on my way to his office
in a few minutes.

12:41.975 --> 12:43.243
Well, if I could get
evidence like that

12:43.309 --> 12:46.312
to the media,
Malaba is finished.

12:46.379 --> 12:48.314
So, you think you can call
a press conference for tonight.

12:50.751 --> 12:52.052
[phone ringing]

12:52.118 --> 12:53.520
Maxine Shaw.

12:53.587 --> 12:54.921
Oh, hello, Miller.

12:54.988 --> 12:57.558
How are things at the diaper
you call a newspaper?

12:57.624 --> 12:59.560
Yeah, well, chill the freak out,
Miller, look

12:59.626 --> 13:01.968
I'm callin' a press conference
at 7:00 p. m. at which

13:02.035 --> 13:04.304
I will respond
to Mr. Malaba's charges

13:04.370 --> 13:07.674
with a shocking
development of my own.

13:07.741 --> 13:10.010
Be here.
And ride the maverick.

13:11.812 --> 13:13.313
Ah, thank you, Kyle.

13:13.379 --> 13:14.615
You know, I guess it's true.

13:14.681 --> 13:17.017
Politics do make
strange bedfellows.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.284
[chuckles]

13:18.351 --> 13:20.854
Maxine Shaw, you were
a strange bedfellow

13:20.921 --> 13:23.189
long before politics.

13:31.765 --> 13:34.635
Now, how long will this
little Q and A gonna take?

13:34.701 --> 13:35.936
Uh, just a few questions

13:36.002 --> 13:37.604
and you'll be out of here
in a jiffy.

13:37.671 --> 13:39.806
‐ Last name?
‐ Jones.

13:47.781 --> 13:50.951
No, if I were an O..

13:51.885 --> 13:53.620
...where would I hide.

13:55.522 --> 13:56.790
Well, you know something
officer.

13:56.857 --> 13:58.058
I'm a professional secretary

13:58.124 --> 13:59.526
why don't you scoot on over
and I'll have

13:59.593 --> 14:00.867
these forms done
toot sweet.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.235
‐ Yeah. Come on, mama.
‐ Yeah.

14:02.302 --> 14:03.303
Alright.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.374
Oh‐oh, wait now,
that's a zero.

14:11.778 --> 14:13.346
Just let that dry.

14:14.848 --> 14:17.317
And therefore we see no need
to drag this minor matter

14:17.383 --> 14:18.852
before a jury.

14:18.919 --> 14:21.755
Are you suggesting my clients
put aside their sense of justice

14:21.822 --> 14:23.323
in exchange for money?

14:23.389 --> 14:26.192
Because it's a mighty
good suggestion.

14:26.259 --> 14:27.561
How much are we
talkin' about?

14:27.628 --> 14:32.265
As a symbolic gesture
we're willing to offer $500.

14:32.332 --> 14:35.135
‐ A 150,000.
‐ 10,000.

14:35.201 --> 14:36.703
I'm good to go.

14:36.770 --> 14:38.739
[indecipherable squeaking]

14:38.805 --> 14:41.207
Can we get on some kinda
payment plan?

14:41.274 --> 14:44.477
Say 48.50 a month
for the next 17 years.

14:45.546 --> 14:47.147
Here they are, man.

14:47.213 --> 14:49.349

Russell, are you drunk?

14:55.722 --> 14:56.790
Because that will numb the pain

14:56.857 --> 14:59.292
when I snatch them hairs
off your chest.

14:59.359 --> 15:00.861
Wait, man. Wait.

15:00.927 --> 15:04.270
I knew these gaseous sweet
potatoes were rip‐off artists.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.407
So, I spent the last five hours
in a recording studio

15:07.473 --> 15:08.909
analyzing the song.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.378

the signal processin'.

Right now, I'm going
to the precinct

16:34.200 --> 16:37.303

"Flavor" is not dead yet.

What the hell
are you doin' here?

16:54.588 --> 16:56.523
Well, when I heard
about this press conference

16:56.590 --> 16:58.659
I figured that you were
resigning from the race

16:58.725 --> 17:01.134
so I rushed right down
to gloat.

You know what?
Good, stick around.

to say you'll feel as dumb

17:06.839 --> 17:09.041
as you look in that hat.

17:11.612 --> 17:13.579
May I have your
attention please.

17:15.516 --> 17:16.817
Yes!

17:19.085 --> 17:21.287
Over the course
of this campaign

17:21.354 --> 17:23.656
my opponent Paul Malaba

17:23.723 --> 17:26.026
has said some pretty shocking
things about me.

17:31.364 --> 17:33.900
But what I have to say
about Mr. Malaba

17:33.967 --> 17:35.969
is even more shocking.

17:36.036 --> 17:38.371
And this is the man
who has that

'shocking, shocking evidence.'

Evidence that will
shock you!

Uh, Malaba's people
destroyed all the evidence.

17:51.552 --> 17:53.754
You do not have
one shred of proof.

Um, hi.

18:00.634 --> 18:01.835
Uh.

18:09.510 --> 18:11.978
Fact is, uh, every word

that Paul Malaba
has said about me is true.

18:16.282 --> 18:17.818

really say about me?

‐ That I'm a woman.

18:20.787 --> 18:22.656
With a passion for life?

18:24.290 --> 18:25.992
Guilty.

18:26.059 --> 18:28.461
That I'm a woman who's willing
to go all the way

to get what she wants
over and over again

are exhausted and spent?

of the perfect woman.
