02:08.918 --> 02:11.268
Can you remember
anything from that day?

02:15.185 --> 02:18.187
You said she has a house.

02:18.188 --> 02:21.365
A house you cannot see
and a book you cannot read.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.113
That she wanted you
to do things.

02:44.127 --> 02:47.869
You know, sometimes,
when we're lonely or confused,

02:47.870 --> 02:51.525
we create imaginary friends.
And they can seem so real...

02:51.526 --> 02:53.745
Her name is Mercy.

03:17.639 --> 03:21.643
Thank you, Arden.
And no more stealing pens. Okay?

03:24.690 --> 03:27.909
Oh, that kid steals all my pens.

03:27.910 --> 03:30.695
You look great.
Thank you.

03:30.696 --> 03:33.175
You've been sleeping?
You sleeping better?

03:33.176 --> 03:36.091
The dreams?
Better, usually. Yeah.

03:36.092 --> 03:40.922
Good. You've done the hard work.
You've come so far.

03:40.923 --> 03:43.011
When you first came here,
you were just a...

03:43.012 --> 03:46.058
Suffering from undiagnosed
juvenile pre-schizophrenia

03:46.059 --> 03:49.670
with a tendency toward
self-induced hallucinations.

03:49.671 --> 03:51.585
And...

03:51.586 --> 03:53.674
a lot of other things.

03:53.675 --> 03:55.110
Well, look at you.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.112
No, I was gonna say
a confused little girl.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.941
But that is not who you are now.

04:01.422 --> 04:05.120
Sometimes I miss
believing in something.

04:05.121 --> 04:08.080
Does that sound crazy?
No. No, it's not crazy.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.690
We all need to believe
in something.

04:09.691 --> 04:12.127
Hell, I believed in Santa
till...

04:12.128 --> 04:14.739
I still believe in Santa.

04:14.740 --> 04:16.435
We all need to
believe in something,

04:16.437 --> 04:18.438
whether it's religion,
another person,

04:18.439 --> 04:20.353
our own intellect.

04:20.353 --> 04:22.747
It's all part of
the human condition.

04:22.748 --> 04:25.706
How do know
what you believe in is real?

04:25.707 --> 04:28.056
Well... you don't.

04:28.057 --> 04:29.711
You have to choose.

04:32.714 --> 04:36.457
I have filed the papers
for your release.

04:38.764 --> 04:41.417
What?
It's okay. It's okay.

04:41.418 --> 04:45.813
You're ready for this.
This is such good news for you.

04:45.814 --> 04:47.423
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

04:47.424 --> 04:49.425
If you stay here

04:49.426 --> 04:51.601
your life will be defined by
your past,

04:51.602 --> 04:54.604
whether you remember it or not,

04:54.605 --> 04:56.999
and you were meant for
so much more.

04:58.479 --> 05:01.524
Doc... Dr. Ward... Etta...

05:01.525 --> 05:04.789
Do you really believe in that?
Yes.

05:04.790 --> 05:06.226
I choose to.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.239
Hi.
Hi.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.721
Hi, it's so good
to see you again.

05:23.722 --> 05:26.332
Hey, sis.

05:29.553 --> 05:30.858
Do you want me to take your bag?

05:30.859 --> 05:34.732
Yeah. Thank you.
Yeah.

05:34.733 --> 05:37.343
Well, this is it.
Oh.

05:37.344 --> 05:40.868
This is good. This is good.

05:40.869 --> 05:43.219
Okay.
I'm gonna miss you.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.683
So Bryce is eight now.

06:13.684 --> 06:15.729
Well, eight and a quarter,
he'll insist.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.470
His dad didn't stick around
for long.

06:17.471 --> 06:20.603
I mean, no cards or birthday,
for anything.

06:20.604 --> 06:22.083
Asshole.

06:22.084 --> 06:24.825
I am dating again.
I'm seeing this guy, Will.

06:24.826 --> 06:27.610
I think you'll like him.
Do you like chicken?

06:27.611 --> 06:29.743
I didn't even, I didn't even
think to ask you,

06:29.744 --> 06:31.701
but I planned chicken
for your first night back.

06:31.702 --> 06:34.922
Is that okay?
Yeah. That sounds great.

06:34.923 --> 06:37.578
Okay, good. Yeah.

06:43.279 --> 06:46.848
And after mom died, dad didn't
really keep the place up.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.245
I didn't think
I'd ever see this place again.

06:54.203 --> 06:56.988
I know it's not
what it used to be, but...

06:59.556 --> 07:01.644
Hey, beautiful.

07:01.645 --> 07:05.823
That's Rowlf. Like the Muppet.
Hi, Rowlf.

07:12.613 --> 07:14.049
Welcome home.

07:18.662 --> 07:20.360
Damn it.

07:21.927 --> 07:25.277
Bryce?
Hey, bubba. You home?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.366
He walks from school,
so he should be here.

07:27.367 --> 07:29.194
Bryce!

07:29.195 --> 07:31.152
Hey, your Aunt Marina's here.

07:57.266 --> 07:59.615
- Here... here's your bag.
- Thanks.

07:59.616 --> 08:01.314
Same bed.

08:06.972 --> 08:11.019
Alice. Thank you...
for everything.

08:13.979 --> 08:16.416
Well, I'll... I'll go get that
chicken started.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.564
Don't tell him
I'm here.

09:18.565 --> 09:20.392
Oh. Hi.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.437
You must be Bryce.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.483
I'm sorry I scared you.

09:24.484 --> 09:26.964
Found you!

09:26.965 --> 09:28.617
Ow!
Loser, loser!

09:28.618 --> 09:32.056
Bryce!
I said no friends today.

09:32.057 --> 09:33.796
I didn't invite him.

09:33.797 --> 09:36.321
I never invite him.

09:36.322 --> 09:40.238
Hmm. Are those
pictures of your mom?

09:40.239 --> 09:42.892
And my dad. He works for NASA.

09:42.893 --> 09:45.025
He's on a secret mission.

09:45.026 --> 09:47.071
I can't really talk about it.

09:47.072 --> 09:49.682
Oh, okay.

09:49.683 --> 09:52.077
My mom's really glad
you're here.

09:54.035 --> 09:55.297
Me too.

10:48.350 --> 10:53.441
One, two, three,
four, five.

10:53.442 --> 10:56.836
Not real, not real,
not real, not real.

11:09.589 --> 11:11.243
Bryce.

11:18.163 --> 11:20.251
Oh.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.261
Oh, shoot.

11:30.262 --> 11:33.960
Oh, you scared me.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.049
You were having a nightmare.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.443
Oh.
Are you okay?

11:38.444 --> 11:42.534
Yeah. I just have
bad dreams sometimes.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.885
I brought my nightlight.
Oh.

11:52.327 --> 11:54.851
Won't you need it?
I'm almost nine.

11:56.723 --> 11:58.680
Okay.

11:58.681 --> 12:00.553
Thank you.

12:17.396 --> 12:19.658
Good morning.
Good morning.

12:19.659 --> 12:21.312
Whoa.

12:21.313 --> 12:23.183
You could've slept in, you know?

12:23.184 --> 12:26.012
Where can I find the Wanted Ads?

12:26.013 --> 12:27.927
Uh...

12:27.928 --> 12:30.234
Just type
in "Bowsman Jobs."

12:30.235 --> 12:33.150
I'm looking for
a job that I can walk to.

12:33.151 --> 12:35.457
Just click on any one you want.

12:37.111 --> 12:40.374
Wow, you can
find anything in here.

12:40.375 --> 12:43.595
Didn't your art school
have Internet?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.424
My what?
Your art school. In England.

12:46.425 --> 12:50.167
Hey, Bryce, would you go
take Rowlf for a walk?

12:50.168 --> 12:52.170
- He's going nuts outside.
- Sure, mom.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.043
Thanks, bubba.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.917
I... I just thought it would be
easier on everyone.

13:01.918 --> 13:04.833
I... want to protect him.

13:04.834 --> 13:07.880
A... and you.
Oh, sure.

13:07.881 --> 13:11.579
I... I just hope he doesn't
see me draw anything.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.974
Thanks.

13:20.894 --> 13:23.287
So, I told him, twice, I said,

13:23.288 --> 13:26.159
you g... you got... you
got to p... pump the thing

13:26.160 --> 13:28.248
or your whole house is gonna
smell like this.

13:28.249 --> 13:29.336
Oh, no.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.903
So, not even two weeks later...

13:30.904 --> 13:32.470
I'm not kidding.
Oh, no.

13:32.471 --> 13:35.908
This guy,
he calls me in the morning.

13:35.909 --> 13:39.128
"Jesus! Jesus!
My... my house, my house!"

13:39.129 --> 13:42.523
"It smells like shit!
I need you down here! Huh?"

13:42.524 --> 13:44.960
Language!
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:44.961 --> 13:46.788
- Poo? Poo, okay?
- Better.

13:46.789 --> 13:49.226
"My house! It smells like
a shitload of poop!"

13:49.227 --> 13:51.315
"I need your help!"

13:51.316 --> 13:52.925
I... I can't do anything, you
know?

13:52.926 --> 13:55.144
I could go over there...
Alright, alright...

13:55.145 --> 13:57.059
On that note...

13:57.060 --> 14:00.802
It's time for bed, bubba.
Really? It's a special day.

14:00.803 --> 14:02.456
Come on, bubba.
No arguing.

14:02.457 --> 14:05.025
No arguing. Come on.
Up you go.

14:07.157 --> 14:09.420
You forgettin' somethin'?

14:09.421 --> 14:12.466
Put 'em up. Oh! Oh! Oh!
He go... He goes for the chin.

14:12.467 --> 14:15.426
He goes for the gut.
Put your hands up by your face.

14:15.427 --> 14:19.212
Duck! Duck! Duck!
Okay. Enough cage match.

14:19.213 --> 14:20.692
Come on.
Okay.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.650
Alright. Alright. Little pound.

14:36.012 --> 14:38.797
Oh, no. I'm okay. I'm actually,
I'm feelin' a little dizzy.

14:38.798 --> 14:40.625
Oh, sure.
Yeah, I mean, it must...

14:40.626 --> 14:43.367
This must be
your first drink in...

14:43.368 --> 14:45.194
Ever.

14:45.195 --> 14:49.851
Right. Well, like the kid said,
you know, special day.

14:49.852 --> 14:53.290
So...
Okay.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.335
Okay.

14:56.816 --> 14:58.426
Heavy hand, I guess.

14:59.993 --> 15:03.213
To a special day Cheers.

15:07.392 --> 15:11.046
Must feel pretty good
to be out, huh?

15:11.047 --> 15:14.876
It's strange. I keep expecting
someone to tell me what to do.

15:14.877 --> 15:17.009
Well,
give Alice a couple days,

15:17.010 --> 15:18.663
she'll have you sand the stairs.

15:18.664 --> 15:20.708
She will.

15:20.709 --> 15:26.497
Ah. So, uh, what's,
what's next for ya?

15:26.498 --> 15:29.761
I was thinkin'
about applying for jobs.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.199
Oh, nice.
Maybe going back to school.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.419
I was thinking about doin'
something in child psychology.

15:38.336 --> 15:41.294
What?
Is that funny?

15:41.295 --> 15:44.211
No one's gonna call
your resume boring, you know.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.825
I'm sorry. Uh, was that rude?

15:50.826 --> 15:54.047
I was just, uh, I was just
tryin' to break up the tension.

15:55.657 --> 15:57.572
You know. Uh...

16:00.445 --> 16:02.794
You must think
about it though, right?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.710
I don't really remember.

16:05.711 --> 16:08.496
Oh, sure. Yeah.
It happened a long time ago.

16:10.106 --> 16:11.803
But, I mean,
you got to remember some of it...

16:11.804 --> 16:14.458
I don't really like
talkin' about it.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Of course.

16:16.591 --> 16:20.115
It's just
I'm a true crime buff,

16:20.116 --> 16:21.682
so I just wolf those books down.

16:21.683 --> 16:24.859
I mean, like Andrea Yates,
Bundy, Black Dahlia,

16:24.860 --> 16:31.562
so to me... it's like talkin'
to a... celebrity.

16:31.563 --> 16:36.219
I mean, two friends
lure a girl into the woods...

16:38.483 --> 16:44.009
stab her seven times
all for Mercy Black.

16:44.010 --> 16:45.837
Can you please
not say that name?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.013
Sure. Yep. Yep.
I'm sorry. It's...

16:48.014 --> 16:49.754
You're gonna have a hard time
avoiding it

16:49.755 --> 16:51.496
because it's, it's popular.

16:53.454 --> 16:55.281
It's popular?

16:55.282 --> 16:57.545
Yeah, Mercy Black went viral.

16:59.329 --> 17:01.635
I mean, she spread like a virus.

17:01.636 --> 17:05.988
You know, photos, stories,

17:07.512 --> 17:10.036
copycat crimes.

17:11.559 --> 17:13.691
I mean, you...

17:13.692 --> 17:15.997
You brought the world
a whole new nightmare.

17:41.502 --> 17:43.417
Marina.

18:03.742 --> 18:05.483
Marina.

18:22.412 --> 18:25.066
Bryce!

18:39.473 --> 18:41.387
Bryce!

18:55.576 --> 18:58.622
Are you hiding again?

18:58.623 --> 19:00.059
Bryce!

19:18.599 --> 19:21.167
Hey. Hey.

19:30.568 --> 19:34.005
Hey, it's just drunk assholes
trying to be funny.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.226
Will probably knows 'em.
I'll talk to him about it.

19:38.227 --> 19:41.360
So, look,
I tried to get off today,

19:41.361 --> 19:42.666
but no one could cover for me.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.103
So, I'll pick Bryce up
from the library

19:45.104 --> 19:47.322
on my drive home. Okay?

19:47.323 --> 19:49.629
Are you leaving?

19:49.630 --> 19:51.936
Yeah, but I'll be
back by 5:00, 5:30.

19:51.937 --> 19:54.721
Uh, you'll,
you'll be fine, right?

19:54.722 --> 19:58.072
Yeah, I'll find something
useful to do.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.335
You could always
sand the staircase.

20:00.336 --> 20:04.470
Hey, Bryce?
Bryce. Come on, bubba.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.604
We don't wanna be late
for school.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.479
Alright. Let's go.

20:14.612 --> 20:17.440
I just wanna be on time
once this year.

20:23.142 --> 20:24.838
Mom.

20:24.839 --> 20:27.580
Who's Mercy Black?

20:27.581 --> 20:29.496
Where did you hear that name?

20:31.280 --> 20:34.196
Hey. I don't want you
talking about that, okay?

20:35.763 --> 20:37.896
We're going to be late.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.110
Hi! Welcome to the Wood Nook.
So you want to do some sanding?

21:19.111 --> 21:22.113
In this video,
we'll take you step by step.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.246
Let's get to it.

21:33.778 --> 21:35.127
Oh.

21:38.391 --> 21:41.523
Yeah..

21:41.524 --> 21:44.788
It is a tragedy

21:44.789 --> 21:48.313
how other people
treat library books.

21:48.314 --> 21:50.054
It's like...

21:50.055 --> 21:51.925
they can't respect a thing

21:51.926 --> 21:54.449
unless it cost them somethin'.

21:54.450 --> 21:55.843
Mrs. Bellows...

21:58.367 --> 22:01.805
do you know who Mercy Black is?

22:01.806 --> 22:03.850
I don't think so.

22:03.851 --> 22:06.853
I think
she's living in my house.

22:06.854 --> 22:09.769
Oh. I see.

22:12.773 --> 22:16.734
You know where librarians go
when they have a question?

22:21.434 --> 22:23.261
The internet.

22:27.092 --> 22:30.007
Want to go check it out?

22:30.008 --> 22:31.879
Yeah, okay, come on.

22:36.884 --> 22:38.276
Oh, uh,
you know what?

22:38.277 --> 22:40.452
Maybe this is
not a good idea.

22:40.453 --> 22:42.976
I think that...
Is she a ghost?

22:42.977 --> 22:45.196
Um, no.
See, right here.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.328
She's like more of a,
a guardian angel.

22:47.329 --> 22:50.288
She seeks out sad kids
and she takes away

22:50.289 --> 22:52.507
what hurts them,
but not for free.

22:52.508 --> 22:57.730
"A perfect offering that will
make her flesh and blood."

22:57.731 --> 23:02.082
Flesh and blood?
Bryce.

23:02.083 --> 23:05.130
Buddy, buddy, it's,
it's only a story. Okay?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.351
You know what?

23:10.352 --> 23:14.355
Um, w... when I was a kid,

23:14.356 --> 23:17.706
I, I used to ask questions
all the time.

23:17.707 --> 23:20.361
I used to dream that
they would build a library

23:20.362 --> 23:24.061
that was big enough to hold
every book,

23:24.062 --> 23:26.150
every fact ever written.

23:26.151 --> 23:29.109
And then boom.

23:29.110 --> 23:30.676
They did.

23:30.677 --> 23:36.029
But, but, but, when you know
all the answers,

23:36.030 --> 23:37.596
then you lose all the mystery.

23:37.597 --> 23:40.686
There's nothing left to make up.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.689
Yeah, see, Th... Th... that's why
people tell stories

23:43.690 --> 23:44.908
like, like Mercy Black.

23:44.909 --> 23:47.301
They, they want some mystery.

23:47.302 --> 23:52.611
They want questions that they
can't quite find the answer for.

23:52.612 --> 23:56.484
So, you see, she's just a story.

23:56.485 --> 23:58.922
But some stories are true.

23:58.923 --> 24:01.533
They are.

24:01.534 --> 24:03.927
How can you tell the difference?

24:03.928 --> 24:08.932
W... well, I mean, just...

24:08.933 --> 24:12.022
Um...

24:12.023 --> 24:13.327
Wow, that's a, that's a,

24:13.328 --> 24:16.374
That's a really
great question, Bryce.

24:17.419 --> 24:19.725
Oh, well, well,

24:19.726 --> 24:21.814
Mr. Crosby has
his weekly reading,

24:21.815 --> 24:23.729
and I, uh, I think you've got
some homework

24:23.730 --> 24:25.339
you should be workin' on, okay?

24:25.340 --> 24:28.952
So, let's, um, let's log off
of Mercy Black.

24:28.953 --> 24:30.301
Shut it down. Okay?
Okay.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.520
Alright. Thank you.
Hi, Mr. Crosby.

24:32.521 --> 24:36.438
Sorry about that.
Ooh. Quite a picking, sir.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.988
Sorry. Sorry.

25:48.989 --> 25:51.382
Uh, sorry.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.907
What are you doing here?
Oh, I knocked, albeit lightly.

25:54.908 --> 25:57.431
The backdoor doesn't
really lock,

25:57.432 --> 26:01.044
so, yeah, uh, basically,
I was just, you know...

26:01.045 --> 26:03.307
Alice told me to stop by.

26:03.308 --> 26:06.440
She wanted to see
how you were holdin' up.

26:06.441 --> 26:09.356
So she got you
sandin' the stairs?

26:11.925 --> 26:13.231
Uh.

26:16.016 --> 26:20.889
Look, I, uh, I heard about last
night, and, uh, this town...

26:20.890 --> 26:25.677
You're...
you're shakin'.

26:25.678 --> 26:27.940
Here, sit. Sit down,
and I... I'll make the...

26:27.941 --> 26:30.725
What, what were you makin'?
Tea.

26:30.726 --> 26:33.468
Yeah. Tea. Yeah.

26:37.951 --> 26:41.259
Look, I, uh...

26:44.305 --> 26:49.831
I know it's rough,
but it will all calm down.

26:49.832 --> 26:54.184
You know, you may not
remember much, but they do.

26:54.185 --> 26:57.100
We were just little girls.
Oh, oh, oh, I know.

26:57.101 --> 27:01.278
And, and, and Rebecca Cline,
she manipulated you.

27:01.279 --> 27:03.932
I can't believe they let her out
before you, which is like...

27:03.933 --> 27:07.066
They let her out? Rebecca?

27:07.067 --> 27:11.375
Oh, they really
didn't tell you much, did they?

27:16.207 --> 27:20.949
Look. Ah, forget it.
This is...

27:20.950 --> 27:23.214
Maybe instead of...

27:24.780 --> 27:26.217
running from it...

27:28.915 --> 27:30.524
you embrace it.

27:30.525 --> 27:34.312
You... you could
do some talk shows.

27:35.443 --> 27:38.228
Talk shows?
Yeah.

27:38.229 --> 27:40.230
Yeah. Get your side out,

27:40.231 --> 27:42.754
or sooner or later,
someone else will.

27:42.755 --> 27:45.757
I'm surprised "Dateline" isn't
here knockin' at the door...

27:45.758 --> 27:48.020
I... I told you.
I... I don't, I...

27:48.021 --> 27:49.543
I don't really remember.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.720
It's like,
it's like that wasn't me.

27:52.721 --> 27:55.158
Yeah, but it was you.

27:55.159 --> 27:58.857
You've paid your debt.
And all that.

27:58.858 --> 28:01.729
It's time to make a profit.

28:03.906 --> 28:06.039
I think you should go.

28:08.215 --> 28:09.259
Look. Hey!

28:13.481 --> 28:16.309
Ah.

28:18.182 --> 28:21.445
Come on.
Let's just talk about it.

28:21.446 --> 28:24.709
Look, I'm sure
the late-night visitors

28:24.710 --> 28:26.625
sparked a few memories, huh?

28:32.892 --> 28:36.024
Come on.
Would you just listen to me?

28:36.025 --> 28:38.636
It's easy money.

28:38.637 --> 28:41.595
We'll collaborate.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.511
Get away from me!
Aah!

28:45.209 --> 28:47.862
You crazy bitch!

28:47.863 --> 28:48.907
Hey, we're ho...

28:50.431 --> 28:52.650
Will? What's going on?

28:52.651 --> 28:56.610
Uh.
Nothin'. Nothin'.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.917
Wait, Will, hold up.
What happened to your hand?

28:58.918 --> 29:01.267
Your goddamn sister cut me!

29:01.268 --> 29:03.574
She's crazy!

29:03.575 --> 29:07.099
And you think your son's safe?
He's not!

29:07.100 --> 29:10.059
Goddamn dog!
Hey! Get off my property.

29:12.975 --> 29:15.500
Nice. Nice.

29:18.981 --> 29:20.765
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

29:20.766 --> 29:22.898
Get inside the house.

29:43.441 --> 29:47.487
Hey. Um, I'm sorry about Will.

29:47.488 --> 29:50.055
Don't be. He's an asshole.

29:50.056 --> 29:54.755
Um, Alice, I think maybe
I should find my own place.

29:54.756 --> 29:56.844
Absolutely not.

29:56.845 --> 29:58.977
You just got here, and besides
your doctor said that

29:58.978 --> 30:00.239
you shouldn't be living alone.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.154
I've ruined
so many people's lives,

30:02.155 --> 30:05.157
and I don't wanna
ruin yours, too.

30:05.158 --> 30:08.334
You're not going anywhere.
A... Alice...

30:08.335 --> 30:10.859
I don't wanna hear
any more about it.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.032
Will?

32:23.688 --> 32:27.386
Marina!
Marina, I need you!

32:27.387 --> 32:29.997
- No, stay back, Bryce!
- You stay right there!

32:29.998 --> 32:32.348
Oh, my God.

32:37.397 --> 32:39.312
Rowlf.

32:41.270 --> 32:44.142
You watch Bryce.
Alice. You're going?

32:44.143 --> 32:45.970
Will did this.

32:45.971 --> 32:48.581
Either that or he put
his drinking buddies up to it.

32:48.582 --> 32:50.278
A... Alice,
just go to the police.

32:50.279 --> 32:51.845
Damn it, Marina,
do you think the police

32:51.846 --> 32:53.456
are actually gonna
come down here?

32:53.457 --> 32:56.546
For you?
Bryce, it's time for bed.

32:56.547 --> 32:58.462
Aunt Marina's gonna watch you.

33:00.159 --> 33:01.987
Was it Mercy?

33:07.471 --> 33:10.387
You never went to art school,
did you?

33:13.651 --> 33:16.784
I searched your name.
I found some stories.

33:26.751 --> 33:29.492
You know, when I was your age...

33:29.493 --> 33:31.668
when I was a little girl...

33:31.669 --> 33:34.584
my mom got sick.

33:34.585 --> 33:37.543
Your grandmother.

33:37.544 --> 33:41.591
She got very sick,
and I was worried that

33:41.592 --> 33:42.941
she wasn't gonna get better.

33:44.899 --> 33:49.425
I had a friend named Rebecca,
who was very smart,

33:49.426 --> 33:53.516
and we played a game.

33:53.517 --> 33:56.694
We made a friend,
someone who could protect us...

33:58.522 --> 34:02.481
and I pretended
that she could help me,

34:02.482 --> 34:04.701
and help me make my mom better.

34:04.702 --> 34:07.138
Did she?

34:07.139 --> 34:10.663
She wasn't real, Bryce.

34:10.664 --> 34:12.621
Rebecca made her up,

34:12.623 --> 34:16.409
and... I believed her.

34:18.193 --> 34:19.498
Why?

34:21.239 --> 34:24.329
Because I was lonely and sad,

34:24.330 --> 34:28.638
and I was a little sick.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.987
Like the flu?

34:29.987 --> 34:34.382
Like the flu... but in my head.

34:34.382 --> 34:37.081
You know, that's why
I was away for so long,

34:37.081 --> 34:41.302
because I was just
trying to get better.

34:41.303 --> 34:43.087
Did you do something,

34:43.088 --> 34:46.047
something that made them
send you away?

34:51.183 --> 34:54.054
I think you already know
the answer to that.

34:54.054 --> 34:57.232
And your mom,
did she get better?

35:03.587 --> 35:07.198
What if I see Mercy Black?

35:07.199 --> 35:08.721
You won't.

35:08.722 --> 35:10.855
What if I do?

35:13.379 --> 35:15.772
When I see something...

35:15.773 --> 35:17.818
something that I know
isn't real...

35:19.777 --> 35:22.127
I close my eyes...

35:24.085 --> 35:26.434
...and I count to five.

35:26.435 --> 35:28.436
One, two,

35:28.437 --> 35:31.527
three, four, five.

35:31.528 --> 35:33.442
And when I open them...

35:35.227 --> 35:38.229
everything's fine.

35:38.230 --> 35:41.320
But you won't see her
because she is not real.

36:13.700 --> 36:17.529
All these people
were frightened.

36:17.530 --> 36:19.619
How can she not be real?

36:26.931 --> 36:31.935
Will! Will, you son of a bitch,
where are you?

36:31.936 --> 36:34.502
Oh! Did you...
Did you put them up to it? Huh?

36:34.503 --> 36:36.548
Alice, calm down, no. Alice!
Were you there with them?

36:36.549 --> 36:38.811
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:38.812 --> 36:40.421
What is going on?

36:46.603 --> 36:47.908
Jesus.

36:55.699 --> 36:59.266
What is this?
Okay, don't freak out.

36:59.267 --> 37:04.011
It's, uh... research.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.624
Do you know how much money

37:08.625 --> 37:10.321
you can make off
a true crime book?

37:10.322 --> 37:12.628
How much money we can make?

37:12.629 --> 37:15.282
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

37:15.283 --> 37:17.763
No, Th... think about it.

37:17.764 --> 37:21.593
We write the book. I... I...
I... I... I'm writing the book.

37:21.594 --> 37:25.597
We put your sister's name on it.

37:25.598 --> 37:28.382
Look, I've... I've done
the research.

37:28.383 --> 37:31.037
Kids are going crazy.
I... look, look.

37:31.038 --> 37:34.432
"Russian boy cuts out
sister's tongue."

37:34.433 --> 37:38.741
"Teen mom drowns baby
for Mercy Black."

37:38.742 --> 37:41.047
You talk about her
like she's real.

37:41.048 --> 37:43.354
She's real enough.

37:43.355 --> 37:45.791
This is my sister's life,
you dick!

37:45.792 --> 37:48.489
Yeah, this is my work! Huh!

37:48.490 --> 37:51.536
Hey! You know what, fine!

37:51.537 --> 37:54.191
I'll write it without you! Yeah?

37:54.192 --> 37:56.542
Well, have fun being poor!

38:12.384 --> 38:13.819
Hi.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.517
He wanted to wait for you.

38:16.518 --> 38:19.825
- Thanks for watching him.
- Mom?

38:19.826 --> 38:25.091
Ready to hit the sack? Alright.
Let's go.

38:25.092 --> 38:27.703
Mommy,
are you afraid of her?

38:27.704 --> 38:29.356
Who?

38:29.357 --> 38:32.273
I think she's
all better now.

38:35.624 --> 38:40.324
Yeah, the research was,
uh, was hard, you know.

38:40.325 --> 38:43.153
More d... disturbing,
though, than anything.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.939
You know, I just felt like,
uh, the Mercy Black story

38:46.940 --> 38:48.985
had to be told.

38:48.986 --> 38:52.945
No, thank you, Terry.

38:52.946 --> 38:56.993
No, no.
No, thank you, Terry.

39:11.660 --> 39:14.401
Okay.

39:14.402 --> 39:17.318
Get your stuff together, Will.
Get it together.

39:26.458 --> 39:27.720
Hello?

40:00.840 --> 40:02.059
Hello?

40:06.367 --> 40:07.760
Hello?

40:10.850 --> 40:13.766
Where are you, huh?
This isn't funny!

40:25.952 --> 40:27.214
Hello?

40:30.609 --> 40:31.958
Hello?

40:43.970 --> 40:46.886
Very funny, guys!

40:48.888 --> 40:51.107
Oh, screw this.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.804
Not real, not real!

41:36.805 --> 41:40.548
One, two, three, four, five.

41:48.861 --> 41:50.776
It worked.

42:09.621 --> 42:10.664
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

42:10.665 --> 42:11.752
Bryce!

42:11.753 --> 42:13.058
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

42:13.059 --> 42:14.190
Bryce, are you okay?

42:14.191 --> 42:15.887
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

42:15.888 --> 42:18.977
Mom! Mom! Mom!

42:18.978 --> 42:20.718
I saw her, I saw her!

42:20.719 --> 42:22.763
It was just a dream,
it was just a dream, bubba.

42:22.764 --> 42:25.592
- You're alright, you're okay.
- In the vent.

42:25.593 --> 42:27.290
You're okay. It's okay.

42:27.291 --> 42:29.423
She was watching me.

42:41.827 --> 42:43.568
Touch her.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.879
She's still breathing.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.533
It won't be long now.

42:53.534 --> 42:55.840
Wet your hands in the lake.

42:55.841 --> 42:57.756
The book says to.

43:13.990 --> 43:16.296
Marina, move!

43:36.316 --> 43:38.231
Lily!

43:59.861 --> 44:01.297
He says he saw her.

44:01.298 --> 44:02.994
It was a bad dream,
that's all.

44:02.995 --> 44:05.041
He saw her,
like I saw her!

44:07.130 --> 44:09.392
Marina, hold up.

44:09.393 --> 44:12.003
All my life,
I've been told what to think

44:12.004 --> 44:14.440
and what to believe,
but what if they're wrong?

44:14.441 --> 44:17.835
Hey. I got a little boy up there
who's so freaked out,

44:17.836 --> 44:19.967
he's screaming in his sleep.

44:19.968 --> 44:22.492
He's scribbling on the walls,
because of stories you told him.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.669
Alice, what if
I didn't make this up?

44:25.670 --> 44:27.584
Marina, stop.

44:27.585 --> 44:31.196
Everyone loves telling me that
I'm crazy, or that I'm sick.

44:31.197 --> 44:32.937
What if she's real?

44:32.938 --> 44:35.113
What if there really is
something that is out there?

44:35.114 --> 44:37.420
They searched those woods.

44:37.421 --> 44:39.726
They found nothing.

44:39.727 --> 44:43.208
No hidden house, no magic book,
no Mercy Black.

44:43.209 --> 44:44.775
Just let this go.

44:44.776 --> 44:46.864
What, and pretend like
it didn't happen?

44:46.865 --> 44:48.431
Like I went to art school,

44:48.432 --> 44:50.737
or that his dad
is on some NASA mission?

44:50.738 --> 44:51.999
That's not fair.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.175
I'm sorry, Alice,

44:53.176 --> 44:54.567
I just can't keep pretending.

44:54.568 --> 44:57.484
I have to see if she's real.

45:34.391 --> 45:36.392
Yes?

45:36.393 --> 45:38.916
Hi, Mrs. Cline?

45:38.917 --> 45:41.789
Yes?
I'm Marina Hess.

45:48.448 --> 45:50.884
Rebecca's friend?

45:50.885 --> 45:53.235
You're little Marina?

45:53.236 --> 45:55.889
How have you been?

45:55.890 --> 45:57.630
I'm fine.

45:57.631 --> 45:59.893
Is Rebecca home?

45:59.894 --> 46:01.200
Of course.

46:06.553 --> 46:12.254
My golly, it's good to see you
here again, all grown up!

46:12.255 --> 46:17.041
Ah, oh, Rebecca
was the model guest, they say.

46:17.042 --> 46:20.392
Just got along with everybody.

46:20.393 --> 46:23.787
Of course, sh... she always did.

46:23.788 --> 46:26.355
Aw, Henry.

46:26.356 --> 46:29.533
Henry passed
before she came home.

46:31.230 --> 46:32.709
Oh, it's probably for the best.

46:32.710 --> 46:35.842
He wasn't
the most gentle father.

46:35.843 --> 46:39.629
You know, I'm surprised you and
Rebecca didn't keep in touch.

46:39.630 --> 46:44.373
You were such close friends,
just bugs in a rug.

46:46.898 --> 46:49.421
Would you like some tea?

46:49.422 --> 46:52.119
Mrs. Cline, um...

46:52.120 --> 46:54.600
I really do need t... to
talk to Rebecca.

46:54.601 --> 46:56.907
Of course.

46:56.908 --> 46:58.910
Of course.

47:09.312 --> 47:13.924
Um... the... the trains...

47:13.925 --> 47:16.361
they're... they're so loud

47:16.362 --> 47:18.277
they upset her.

47:23.151 --> 47:26.328
Home was hard for her, at first.

47:26.329 --> 47:30.027
She... she did something rash.

47:30.028 --> 47:34.074
She took one of
Henry's best ties

47:34.075 --> 47:37.862
and wrapped it around her neck.

47:40.821 --> 47:44.041
Hm. I cut her down.

47:44.042 --> 47:45.957
Saved her life.

47:48.351 --> 47:52.136
Rebecca, your friend Marina

47:52.137 --> 47:54.444
is here to see you.

48:00.450 --> 48:03.235
You never stop being a mother...

48:06.760 --> 48:08.675
do you?

48:13.506 --> 48:15.420
I'll just get that tea.

48:15.421 --> 48:16.814
Uh, Mrs. Cline...

48:18.990 --> 48:21.731
did Rebecca ever talk about

48:21.732 --> 48:24.995
what happened
when we were children?

48:24.996 --> 48:30.653
Oh, but you'll always be
children in my eyes.

48:32.090 --> 48:34.222
I'll let you two catch up.

48:49.325 --> 48:50.630
Rebecca.

48:57.681 --> 49:01.424
Rebecca, it's me, Marina Hess.

49:03.208 --> 49:05.123
Do you remember me?

49:11.825 --> 49:12.957
Rebecca.

49:16.569 --> 49:17.701
Rebecca.

49:21.444 --> 49:24.360
I need to find out
if she's real.

50:21.199 --> 50:25.202
A house you cannot see.
I remember.

50:38.608 --> 50:41.523
Let her go, dear!

50:41.524 --> 50:45.222
Let her go, dear!
Let her go, dear!

50:45.223 --> 50:47.137
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

50:47.138 --> 50:50.314
You just hush.
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush!

50:50.315 --> 50:52.534
Mama's here! Mama's here!
Mama's here!

51:01.413 --> 51:04.502
Honey, honey, honey,
ma... mama's here.

51:19.387 --> 51:22.303
Give the blood to her.

51:28.614 --> 51:30.529
This is for you!

51:33.097 --> 51:35.839
This is our offering
to give you life!

51:39.059 --> 51:41.060
There!
Where?

51:41.061 --> 51:42.584
She's there!

51:42.585 --> 51:44.063
Please, Rebecca!

51:44.064 --> 51:46.152
Marina, look!

51:46.153 --> 51:50.809
No, don't! No, no!

51:50.810 --> 51:55.118
Marina... she's here.

52:12.876 --> 52:14.833
Bryce, what are you doing?

52:14.834 --> 52:17.967
Stop, stop, stop!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

52:23.364 --> 52:25.931
Are you okay?

52:25.932 --> 52:27.934
Do you wanna talk about it?

52:44.560 --> 52:47.084
Hey, how are things
goin' at home?

52:52.437 --> 52:57.397
Do you want me to come by
every once in a while?

52:57.398 --> 52:59.923
Maybe check in some time?

53:03.579 --> 53:07.059
My mom's a good mom.

53:07.060 --> 53:09.149
Oh, I... I... I... I know.

53:23.468 --> 53:25.034
Or we'll smash it
on the ground.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.078
No way.

53:26.079 --> 53:27.123
Yeah, my girlfriend

53:27.124 --> 53:28.472
goes to, like, the other school,

53:28.473 --> 53:30.256
so no one sees her, you know?

53:30.257 --> 53:33.738
Oh.
Bryce, perfect timing.

53:33.739 --> 53:35.914
Look who just showed up.
Hey, dude.

53:38.875 --> 53:40.527
Hello, Dr. Ward,

53:40.528 --> 53:42.312
it's Alice Hess,
Marina's sister.

53:42.313 --> 53:44.749
Hi! Alice!

53:44.750 --> 53:46.098
How are you?

53:46.099 --> 53:48.710
How you guys holding up?

53:48.711 --> 53:51.626
Well, we're managing.

53:51.627 --> 53:53.236
Last one in's a loser!

53:55.239 --> 53:59.809
Ah, you lose, I win! Ah!

54:04.988 --> 54:07.555
This place sucks.

54:13.474 --> 54:16.259
You think your mom has sex
with her boyfriend?

54:16.260 --> 54:18.522
I don't know.
I do.

54:18.523 --> 54:21.264
My dad tells me she has sex
with lots of guys.

54:21.265 --> 54:24.007
Bet that's why your dad left.

54:25.965 --> 54:28.880
I'm bored!

54:28.881 --> 54:31.709
I know a game.

54:31.710 --> 54:33.624
Have there been
any episodes

54:33.625 --> 54:36.409
or concerns you'd like
to discuss with me?

54:36.410 --> 54:39.064
I... I think she's seeing
things, doctor.

54:39.065 --> 54:40.980
I... Hearing things.

54:43.591 --> 54:45.984
I'll never tell you
where the detonators are!

54:45.985 --> 54:49.074
I'll die
before I tell you anything!

54:49.075 --> 54:51.991
H... hey, you got to make this
loose, or I can't escape.

54:54.472 --> 54:56.039
Come on, dude.

54:57.736 --> 55:00.652
You're not playing right.
Bryce!

55:05.091 --> 55:08.006
I don't like this, Bryce.

55:10.531 --> 55:13.185
I wanna go home.

55:13.186 --> 55:16.102
Then you better yell for help.

55:17.756 --> 55:19.236
Miss Hess!

55:21.412 --> 55:22.847
Miss Hess!

55:22.848 --> 55:26.459
My... my son, he... he's...

55:28.332 --> 55:29.768
I'm worried about him too.

55:31.552 --> 55:34.076
I can always arrange a visit.

55:34.077 --> 55:36.948
Maybe we can all sit down
and talk about this

55:36.949 --> 55:40.865
a... and... and find... find ways
to ease the transition...

55:40.866 --> 55:44.173
Miss Hess!
I have to go.

55:44.174 --> 55:47.090
Of course, of course,
and always, you can always...

55:49.832 --> 55:52.355
Bryce? Guys?

55:52.356 --> 55:53.660
Miss Hess!

55:53.661 --> 55:57.099
Mom, help! We're in here!

55:57.100 --> 56:00.015
Bryce? Sam?

56:00.016 --> 56:01.756
Bryce!

56:01.757 --> 56:03.932
Let me in the door!

56:03.933 --> 56:06.761
Mom, quick!

56:06.762 --> 56:09.198
- M... Miss!
- Bryce!

56:09.199 --> 56:12.244
I can't, can't get in.

56:12.245 --> 56:15.030
Open the door!

56:17.033 --> 56:18.947
Hey, Bryce!

56:18.948 --> 56:21.645
Open this door right now!

56:21.646 --> 56:24.649
Bryce, you have to
let me in this door right now.

56:26.782 --> 56:29.653
Bubba, open the door, okay?

56:29.654 --> 56:33.265
- Hey, bubba?
- Come...

56:33.266 --> 56:34.876
Mom.

56:34.877 --> 56:37.793
Mom!

56:44.277 --> 56:46.192
My God!

56:49.717 --> 56:51.718
She told me to do it.

58:06.882 --> 58:10.189
You can never tell anyone
where she lives.

58:35.127 --> 58:37.477
A house you cannot see.

59:00.022 --> 59:01.937
She hides here.

01:00:06.088 --> 01:00:07.653
She's already here.

01:00:07.654 --> 01:00:09.265
She's always been here.

01:00:10.614 --> 01:00:12.007
But she needs a body.

01:00:24.106 --> 01:00:26.281
Can she make her better?

01:00:26.282 --> 01:00:27.934
Can she do that?

01:00:27.935 --> 01:00:29.719
Only if you believe.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.288
Only if you promise.

01:00:33.637 --> 01:00:34.942
I promise.

01:01:07.105 --> 01:01:08.976
A book you cannot read.

01:01:15.287 --> 01:01:16.767
We built her up.

01:01:20.336 --> 01:01:22.033
We made it all up.

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:26.384
These are my dad's.

01:01:26.385 --> 01:01:29.780
He takes me hunting,
just him and me.

01:01:40.921 --> 01:01:44.315
My mom gave me this
at the hospital.

01:01:44.316 --> 01:01:47.406
She said I could wear it
until she comes home.

01:02:08.297 --> 01:02:09.863
This is what I saw.

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:18.698
You're nothing.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.356
- No, I... I... I...
- I'm just furious!

01:02:25.357 --> 01:02:29.665
Look, again, I am so sorry.
I don't even know what happened.

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:31.928
Sam said what happened.
You calling him a liar?

01:02:31.929 --> 01:02:34.278
No, of course Sam's not lying.
I... I'm only saying...

01:02:34.279 --> 01:02:35.758
I know it was an accident.
Bryce is...

01:02:35.759 --> 01:02:37.325
That is a
disturbed little boy.

01:02:37.326 --> 01:02:39.240
Hey, that's my son
you're talking about.

01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:41.067
Well, my husband's
ready to sue.

01:02:41.068 --> 01:02:42.983
Well, fine.
He can call my lawyer.

01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:47.466
If I had a lawyer.

01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:49.816
Hey, Bryce...

01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:25.286
He... hello?

01:03:25.287 --> 01:03:27.462
Alice Hess?

01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:28.680
Yes.

01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:30.116
This is
Officer Hamilton

01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:32.075
of the Bowsman
Police Department.

01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:34.425
Uh, do you know a,
a William Nylund?

01:03:34.426 --> 01:03:36.732
Um, y... yeah,

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:39.517
uh, we used to, we...

01:03:40.737 --> 01:03:42.346
Yeah, I... I know him.

01:03:42.347 --> 01:03:44.740
Do you know the
whereabouts of Marina Hess?

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:47.351
Uh, your sister is currently
living with you, correct?

01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:49.048
Why, what's this about?

01:03:49.049 --> 01:03:50.659
Could you come down
to the police station

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.790
and answer a few questions?

01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:53.401
What's going on?

01:03:53.402 --> 01:03:56.927
William Nylund
was found... dead earlier today.

01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:04.238
If you could just come down
to the station

01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:06.632
and answer a, a few questions.

01:04:09.592 --> 01:04:11.288
M... Miss Hess.

01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:12.637
Uh...

01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:15.074
Uh, to... tonight?

01:04:15.075 --> 01:04:16.641
I can send down
a squad car,

01:04:16.642 --> 01:04:18.426
if that'd make it easier.

01:04:18.427 --> 01:04:21.211
No, no, that's fine.
I...

01:04:21.212 --> 01:04:22.952
I'll come right away.

01:04:22.953 --> 01:04:24.302
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:31.483 --> 01:04:33.093
Hey... hey, Bryce?

01:04:35.835 --> 01:04:38.534
Hey, come down here right now,
I'm not kidding.

01:04:45.889 --> 01:04:47.324
Bryce?

01:04:47.325 --> 01:04:49.327
Please don't hurt us.

01:04:51.024 --> 01:04:52.809
Hey, is someone with you?

01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:57.116
Please answer me, bubba.

01:05:00.338 --> 01:05:02.513
Please don't hurt us.

01:05:02.514 --> 01:05:05.516
Please don't hurt us.

01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:11.567
Okay, just please don't hurt us.

01:05:13.395 --> 01:05:15.179
Just please don't hurt us.

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.835
Hey.

01:05:20.097 --> 01:05:21.793
Who were you talking to?

01:05:21.794 --> 01:05:23.839
I was talking to her.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.102
To Mercy.

01:05:26.582 --> 01:05:27.844
Oh.

01:05:30.586 --> 01:05:34.153
Look, I know
things have been tough. I know.

01:05:34.154 --> 01:05:35.938
And I know you miss
your dad, but...

01:05:35.939 --> 01:05:37.723
She's in the house.

01:05:42.685 --> 01:05:44.425
No, she isn't, Bryce.

01:05:44.426 --> 01:05:47.428
She's just outside the door.

01:05:52.477 --> 01:05:54.740
Bryce, there's,
there's nothing there.

01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.134
Nothing.

01:05:59.615 --> 01:06:00.833
Watch.

01:06:01.704 --> 01:06:02.966
No, mommy.

01:06:08.493 --> 01:06:10.451
Look.

01:06:10.452 --> 01:06:12.714
There's... there's nothing. See?

01:06:14.151 --> 01:06:15.544
Nothing.

01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:20.287
Bryce.

01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:24.466
You stop that.

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:28.208
Stop it, Bryce.

01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:51.536
Mommy.

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:07.421
Alice! What happened?

01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:09.423
Ma... Marina.

01:07:09.424 --> 01:07:12.338
What happened?
Mercy.

01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:43.979
Hello.
Roger! Hey, it's Etta.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.285
Etta, long time.
Listen.

01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:50.464
I'm calling because I need some
information on an old case.

01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:51.988
Okay, there we go.

01:07:56.122 --> 01:07:58.995
Bryce, how did your mom fall?

01:08:00.213 --> 01:08:01.737
I'm not allowed to say.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.871
I wanna show you something.

01:08:10.702 --> 01:08:11.964
Here.

01:08:13.792 --> 01:08:16.228
That is Mercy Black.

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:19.928
We made her out of paper,
old clothes, and glue.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.973
She's a lie...

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:24.846
and lies cannot hurt us
if we don't believe in them.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.375
Will you stay
until I'm sleeping?

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:34.813
Sure. I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:22.339 --> 01:09:23.819
Bryce?

01:09:32.305 --> 01:09:33.959
Bryce?

01:09:35.874 --> 01:09:37.484
Bryce?

01:09:53.412 --> 01:09:54.676
Hey.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.331
I know that you are scared.

01:09:59.419 --> 01:10:01.551
Bryce...

01:10:01.552 --> 01:10:03.858
I know the voices
that you're hearing,

01:10:03.859 --> 01:10:05.556
and the things
that you're seeing.

01:10:08.864 --> 01:10:11.517
I held onto so many secrets

01:10:11.518 --> 01:10:13.476
for so long,

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.826
and I didn't tell anyone

01:10:15.827 --> 01:10:17.960
because I knew
that they wouldn't believe me.

01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:22.660
And I didn't say anything
until it was too late.

01:10:25.576 --> 01:10:26.708
But, Bryce...

01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:40.285
I want you to know
that you can tell me anything.

01:10:40.286 --> 01:10:44.290
Anything at all
and I will believe you.

01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:26.288
Mercy Black!
She's coming!

01:11:26.289 --> 01:11:27.506
She's trying to get my family...

01:11:27.507 --> 01:11:28.943
Shh, shh, shh.

01:11:28.944 --> 01:11:30.901
It's alright.

01:11:30.902 --> 01:11:32.687
I'm here now,
I'm gonna help you.

01:11:43.001 --> 01:11:45.438
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what to do.

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:11.550
I have some things I need to do.

01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:13.552
You wait in here.

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:17.339
Hey.
Huh!

01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:19.603
Go.

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:29.177
You do exactly as you promised,

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.136
and nothing will happen
to your mom.

01:12:35.706 --> 01:12:37.707
Marina?

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.578
Marina?

01:12:39.579 --> 01:12:40.971
Marina?

01:12:40.972 --> 01:12:43.800
What the... Marina?

01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:46.020
Marina? Marina, can you hear me?

01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:47.195
Bryce.
Are you okay?

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.370
Where is he?
What happened?

01:12:48.371 --> 01:12:49.501
She attacked me.

01:12:49.502 --> 01:12:50.764
I have to find my nephew.

01:12:50.765 --> 01:12:52.461
She? She who?

01:12:52.462 --> 01:12:55.333
She who? Was it Lily?

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:56.683
Was she here?
Lily.

01:12:59.861 --> 01:13:01.079
Lily.

01:13:04.387 --> 01:13:05.822
She fell off
the grid years ago.

01:13:05.823 --> 01:13:08.738
She's changed her name,
and she's back.

01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:11.046
You have
to give her something.

01:13:21.186 --> 01:13:22.622
I promise.

01:13:25.582 --> 01:13:27.365
I know where he is.
I know how to find him.

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:29.803
You can't do this!

01:13:29.804 --> 01:13:33.546
For once,
will you just believe me?

01:15:15.866 --> 01:15:17.171
And this...

01:15:17.172 --> 01:15:18.999
This... This is the house?

01:15:21.959 --> 01:15:24.569
Marina.
Stay here.

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:26.964
And if help comes,
show them the way.

01:15:37.757 --> 01:15:39.455
Come on, pick up.

01:15:51.597 --> 01:15:55.383
You should have left her alone.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.386
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:00.780
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.044
Bryce, Bryce! Hey, hey!

01:16:04.045 --> 01:16:07.047
We got to get out of here.
You okay?

01:16:07.048 --> 01:16:08.657
We have to go.

01:16:11.966 --> 01:16:13.663
Hey, Marina.

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:28.329
Lily.

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:30.244
What did you do?

01:16:30.245 --> 01:16:33.812
I had to make you remember.

01:16:33.813 --> 01:16:36.337
I had to make you
believe again,

01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:37.992
so you could see her.

01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:41.647
We agreed.

01:16:44.302 --> 01:16:45.782
We agreed.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.958
I would be the offering.

01:16:48.959 --> 01:16:51.656
She chose me, but you couldn't
finish the job,

01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:53.745
and your mom died because you
didn't hold your promise.

01:16:53.746 --> 01:16:55.009
She died.

01:16:58.795 --> 01:17:00.623
I had to break into your house.

01:17:05.193 --> 01:17:07.369
I had to do things
to people.

01:17:10.111 --> 01:17:12.155
I had to make you remember,
Marina.

01:17:13.418 --> 01:17:15.637
Bryce, go! Run!

01:17:21.165 --> 01:17:23.601
So when you both left me

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:26.082
I was growing up without you.

01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:28.215
That was the hardest part.

01:17:28.216 --> 01:17:30.130
For so long, I was the only one
who could see her,

01:17:30.131 --> 01:17:31.957
the only one that could believe.

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:34.221
You left me.
You left me alive.

01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:36.658
Lily.

01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:37.789
It wasn't real.

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.139
It was never real!

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.705
Marina!

01:17:43.187 --> 01:17:44.927
The minute the damn knife

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:46.843
touched my skin, she was real!

01:17:48.192 --> 01:17:50.846
Marina, do it!

01:17:50.847 --> 01:17:52.762
- You Promised!
- Do it!

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:01.596
Do it, you promised!

01:18:06.254 --> 01:18:08.168
And now I'm gonna leave you,

01:18:08.169 --> 01:18:09.518
the way you left me.

01:18:11.737 --> 01:18:13.216
Alone.

01:18:14.784 --> 01:18:15.958
And I'm gonna find Bryce,

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:17.742
and I'm gonna slice his throat.

01:18:19.484 --> 01:18:21.007
Unless you stop me.

01:18:22.444 --> 01:18:24.706
Ohh.

01:18:24.707 --> 01:18:27.536
Marina, you never had
enough faith.

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:45.944
Bryce!

01:18:49.427 --> 01:18:51.690
Ah!

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:10.464
Help! Help! Help me!
Shh.

01:20:10.465 --> 01:20:12.335
Bryce. Bryce, stop. Stop.

01:20:24.522 --> 01:20:26.220
Every time I saw you...

01:20:27.264 --> 01:20:29.874
I'd close my eyes

01:20:29.875 --> 01:20:32.050
but I'm never
closing them again.

01:20:32.051 --> 01:20:34.966
I made you,

01:20:34.967 --> 01:20:36.273
from pain...

01:20:40.016 --> 01:20:41.583
And I'm taking it back.

01:20:53.725 --> 01:20:55.857
Oh. Come on.
Ugh!

01:20:55.858 --> 01:20:57.685
Ugh!
No!

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.643
Help! Help me!

01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:01.297
We do this for you!

01:21:01.298 --> 01:21:03.081
We do this for you!

01:21:03.082 --> 01:21:04.954
Agh!
Bryce.

01:21:45.124 --> 01:21:47.301
You want this, don't you?

01:21:52.436 --> 01:21:54.263
You wanted me to kill you.

01:21:54.264 --> 01:21:57.005
Coward!

01:21:57.006 --> 01:21:59.007
You still want to be
the offering?

01:21:59.008 --> 01:22:01.705
We... We could do it
right this time.

01:22:01.706 --> 01:22:03.272
We could make her flesh
and blood.

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:07.146
Look, you promised me.
You promised her.

01:22:38.177 --> 01:22:39.527
It's over, Lily.

01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:43.922
It's over.

01:23:01.462 --> 01:23:03.072
I made a promise.

01:23:16.477 --> 01:23:17.694
Marina.

01:23:20.437 --> 01:23:23.526
Marina. Marina. Marina.
Promise.

01:23:23.527 --> 01:23:25.834
She's here.
No!

01:23:28.489 --> 01:23:30.229
For Mercy.
