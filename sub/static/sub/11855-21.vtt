WEBVTT

00:13.792 --> 00:15.166
- You're here.
- I'm sure am.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.667
- Does this mean?
- I did it.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.041
- And we're going to New York?
- Tomorrow.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.291
I'm finally gonna see Broadway!

00:19.375 --> 00:20.709
You're gonna be on Broadway.

00:20.792 --> 00:22.166
Kelly Witkowski up in lights.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.792
And you're gonna
open your coffee
shop.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.834
Coffee bar.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.709
Am I crazy, Kel? Thinking
people'll pay a buck

00:27.792 --> 00:29.417
for an cappuccino
or an espresso?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
The only crazy thing
is you doubting yourself.

00:31.583 --> 00:32.750
There's no looking back.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.959
Onward and upwards.
Now come on.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.375
- Come on.
- I can't dance.

01:02.458 --> 01:03.917
You can do anything!

01:45.291 --> 01:47.166
Caramel macchiato.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.333
Pay you back?

01:48.417 --> 01:49.583
Yeah, right.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.709
Triple Americano.

01:50.792 --> 01:53.166
Mm. Rocket fuel. Thanks.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.500
Latte with nutmeg?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.166
Yeah. You got a swirly?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.667
No, Your Highness.
Shall I fetch you one?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.041
That'd be good.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.667
And a napkin.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.667
Just got off the
phone
with the Trenton DA.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.041
What about?

02:07.125 --> 02:08.875
Serial killer
named Roy Brigham Anthony's

02:08.959 --> 02:10.417
about to get paroled.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.583
A serial killer didn't get life?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.125
He made a deal in '80.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.375
He confessed to
homicides
they suspected him for

02:16.458 --> 02:17.458
but couldn't prove.

02:17.542 --> 02:18.542
And he got..

02:18.625 --> 02:19.709
25 to life

02:19.792 --> 02:21.667
with mandatory time off
for good behavior.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.250
And he's behaved.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.667
And served his 25 years.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.709
Now Jersey's deal
has come back to haunt
'em.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.709
Yeah. So why they callin' us?

02:28.792 --> 02:30.208
Well, they're hoping
that we can find a
murder

02:30.291 --> 02:32.041
Anthony did in Philly.
Then we can extradite

02:32.125 --> 02:33.208
and lock him up here.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.291
He spent time here?

02:34.375 --> 02:36.375
Summer of '77. When he was 21.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.542
So, we look at all the cold
jobs from that summer.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.709
Gettin' the feeling we're off
to the Garden State.

02:40.792 --> 02:43.208
Yeah, the warden
at Rahson's expecting
you.

02:44.458 --> 02:45.500
'Listen..'

02:47.333 --> 02:49.750
If this guy walks,
he's gonna kill more people.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.709
Jersey DA say that?

02:51.792 --> 02:54.500
No. Roy Brigham Anthony did.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.500
(Will)
'We got a pattern
on this Roy Anthony?'

03:30.583 --> 03:31.959
He killed men and women

03:32.041 --> 03:34.458
at night with his bare hands.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.333
But no sexual abuse, right?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.792
Rules out Maggie here.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.291
Ditto for Victor.
He was killed in the morning.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.041
No robbery, just took a
trinket
from each victim.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.417
Trophies.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, they found a trunk
full
in his basement

03:46.083 --> 03:48.375
matched all of them
to the victims, except
one.

03:48.458 --> 03:49.792
This gold charm.

03:49.875 --> 03:51.125
That a goat?

03:51.208 --> 03:53.542
Hmm. One other thing.

03:53.625 --> 03:57.083
All his victims were wearing
uniforms of some kind.

03:57.166 --> 03:59.208
- Uniforms?
- Yup.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.542
Eliminates all these jobs.

04:01.625 --> 04:03.166
Except Mike Cahill.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.500
What's his story?

04:04.583 --> 04:06.709
Uh, night doorman
at the Carlyle Building.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.625
'Found at the Tasker-Morris
subway station'

04:08.709 --> 04:09.792
in the wee hours.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.917
That's a rough part of town.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.542
- He have a record?
- Nope.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.625
(Nick)
But he was wearing
his doorman's
uniform.

04:14.709 --> 04:17.166
Let's see if Mike carried
a goat charm around.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.417
Guy's our best shot.

04:19.417 --> 04:20.750
He's our only shot.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.792
Hi. I'm Roy.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.125
Detectives Valens and Rush.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.667
Trenton? Uh, Atlantic City?

04:34.750 --> 04:37.166
Philadelphia.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.208
I spent a few months there.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.458
- That's why we're here.
- Oh?

04:43.542 --> 04:44.792
Wondering if you
met up with this
man

04:44.875 --> 04:46.208
during your time there.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.250
Mike Cahill?

04:48.333 --> 04:51.500
Oh, no, sorry, ma'am,
I've never seen him before.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.792
Well, maybe you'll remember him
better like this.

04:55.625 --> 04:56.875
Oh, dear.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.500
(Lilly)
'You've gotta admit'

04:58.583 --> 05:00.834
it looks a lot like
your other handiwork, Roy.

05:05.959 --> 05:07.208
God's work can be brutal.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.625
That's what you call it, huh?

05:09.709 --> 05:11.291
I'm just obeying orders.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.291
From God?

05:13.375 --> 05:15.291
He shines a light
on someone's face

05:15.375 --> 05:17.166
and I-I don't have a choice.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.875
Well, he shine a light
on Mike summer of '77?

05:19.959 --> 05:21.583
I don't know that, man.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.166
Seen this goat
charm before, Roy?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.458
Not that I recall.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.166
Sure it didn't come
from one of your victims?

05:27.250 --> 05:29.375
'Cause it was in the trunk
with all your other
trophies.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.083
- Was it?
- 'Yeah.'

05:31.166 --> 05:33.041
And we think you took
it off of this kid

05:33.125 --> 05:34.792
after you made him
your first kill.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.500
No, sir.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.750
Let's hear about your stay
in Philly, Roy.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.417
From the beginning.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.291
Well, my father took me there

05:43.375 --> 05:45.875
when I was 21, fresh from Provo.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.500
Must have been a shock.
Big city and all.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.083
Oh, it was indeed, ma'am. Um..

05:52.750 --> 05:54.583
I stayed with my Aunt Louise.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.208
I don't want to hear back
from Aunt Louise

05:59.291 --> 06:00.542
about any misbehavior, Roy.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.542
- No, sir.
- He'll be fine, Edward.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.083
'Your aunt was good enough
to find you a job.'

06:04.166 --> 06:05.417
You turn your wages
over to her.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.458
- Yes, sir.
- And wear the garments.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.000
- Yes. Always.
- Or what?

06:09.083 --> 06:11.166
Hellfire and brimstone, sir,
gnashing of teeth.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.291
He's a good boy, I can tell.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.458
You heard about the girl
in Provo?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.959
- Yes.
- 'That's why he's here.'

06:18.041 --> 06:19.667
For a clean slate.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.458
- To reform.
- I'll wear my garmies,
father.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.667
I'll have only clean thoughts.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.834
And?

06:24.917 --> 06:26.166
Um..

06:27.709 --> 06:31.250
Never, ever disrespect the Lord.

06:33.375 --> 06:36.083
Roy, are you listening to me?

06:36.166 --> 06:38.125
Yes, sir.
Do not disrespect the
Lord.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.709
I won't, sir.

06:44.709 --> 06:47.667
When are you coming back for me?

06:47.750 --> 06:48.917
That depends

06:49.000 --> 06:50.917
on how well you obey the rules.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.709
Oh, I'll obey, sir, I promise.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.083
So, what'd you do
to this Provo girl?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.625
I lusted for her.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.834
And that got you
shipped out of
town?

07:11.917 --> 07:14.000
It's against our beliefs.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.667
Outside of marriage, of course.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.750
So you were
pretty scared of your dad.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
He was a powerful man.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.000
He was military.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.333
That's why you killed
people in uniform.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.166
They reminded you of him?

07:26.250 --> 07:27.208
I loved him.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.500
But you couldn't obey his rules

07:28.583 --> 07:30.792
and that made you lash out.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.125
I followed the rules.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.417
You still get orders?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.458
And the light still shines.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.792
That's why I'm glad
I'm getting out.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.250
I have a lot of work
to catch up on.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.667
Sure, I remember Mike.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.333
He worked the door
at the building, two years.

08:01.417 --> 08:02.667
We're trying to connect
him to this guy.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.166
Ever seen him?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.125
Sorry. Who is he?

08:06.208 --> 08:08.000
Serial killer,
Roy Brigham Anthony.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.875
He the guy murdered Mike?

08:09.959 --> 08:12.417
- Could be.
- Oh, that poor kid.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.291
In 30 years, he was probably
my favorite employee.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.917
- Good guy?
- 'Charmer.'

08:17.000 --> 08:18.458
Always had a smile.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.083
And would go the extra mile
for the tenants.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.417
You remember anything unusual
about the day he died?

08:23.500 --> 08:25.417
I remember he quit.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.625
That day?

08:26.709 --> 08:27.875
He gave his notice

08:27.959 --> 08:29.417
said he was headed
to the Big Apple.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.834
To do what?

08:30.917 --> 08:32.208
He had a business idea.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.959
Thought there was a future
in gourmet coffee.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.333
Which there was.

08:36.417 --> 08:37.750
Kid would have had
the Starbucks folks

08:37.834 --> 08:39.542
beat by a decade.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.208
Anyone unhappy
about him leaving?

08:41.291 --> 08:42.208
Everyone.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.458
Like I said, he was a favorite.

08:44.542 --> 08:46.625
But anyone in particular?

08:46.709 --> 08:48.083
Helen Hargrove.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.083
Her husband owned the building.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.583
She and Mike were close?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.750
Well, you'd see those two
chatting 24/7.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.583
And he would tell her
his business plan et cetera.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.875
She a big fan of his idea?

08:58.959 --> 09:00.917
Big fan of Mike's.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.083
(Helen)
'I'm sorry, Denny.
I've changed my mind.'

09:07.166 --> 09:08.959
I'm not feeling up to going out.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.959
This is Beverly Sills'
last tour.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.583
I can't make it tonight.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.083
Tonight? Don't you mean
every night?

09:15.166 --> 09:17.917
I don't know what's
wrong.
Really, I don't.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.125
This is getting tiresome, Helen.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.542
Have a good evening,
Mr. Hargrove.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.166
- He's angry.
- I don't blame him.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.291
Will I see you tonight?

09:33.375 --> 09:34.583
- No.
- No?

09:34.667 --> 09:37.083
- Mike?
- We have to stop, Helen.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.291
No, we don't.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.125
You need help
which I can't give
you.

09:41.208 --> 09:43.166
You help me every night.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.041
If you don't put
an end to this, then I
will.

09:46.125 --> 09:49.041
- What do you mean by that?
- I'll tell your husband.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.834
Everything.

09:50.917 --> 09:53.375
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.166
Some hanky-panky?

10:04.250 --> 10:05.542
Well, like I said she was a fan.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.625
And I did see him
in her apartment

10:08.709 --> 10:10.667
quite a few times.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.291
Late night.

10:12.375 --> 10:15.083
Maybe him going the extra mile
for her got him some trouble?

10:15.166 --> 10:17.750
Mr. Hargrove did have a temper.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.125
And his wife
entertaining the
doorman

10:20.208 --> 10:21.417
might have set him off?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.667
No might about it.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.041
Looks like Mike Cahill

10:28.125 --> 10:29.375
was running around
with a lady tenant.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.208
A married lady tenant.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.709
Kid's caught in a love triangle

10:32.792 --> 10:34.458
that gives a revenge
motive to the husband.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.291
Which means maybe
Roy ain't our guy.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.542
And Jersey's outta luck.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.667
A doorman in Rittenhouse Square

10:40.750 --> 10:43.375
and a Mormon kid in East Falls.

10:43.458 --> 10:46.667
How do they meet up
at the Tasker-Morris stop?

10:46.750 --> 10:49.250
Maybe Roy's aunt
can shed some light.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.458
One of you Scotty Valens?

10:52.959 --> 10:56.083
- Who's askin'?
- Mark Phillips, NYPD.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.542
I'm Valens.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.041
Excuse us, boss.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.750
I understand
you're Christina's
guy.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.667
That's right.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.917
Datin' your partner's sister,
that's gotta be tricky.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.083
What do you want, Phillips?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.792
This is a courtesy call.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.625
Cop to cop.

11:21.709 --> 11:24.291
I got a warrant
for your girl's arrest.

11:27.542 --> 11:28.834
Based on?

11:28.917 --> 11:30.959
I'll talk to her about that.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.667
Well, whatever it is, it's crap.

11:33.834 --> 11:34.959
Okay.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.542
You don't wanna get involved

11:36.625 --> 11:37.750
I'll treat her like a skel.

11:37.834 --> 11:38.917
I'll pick her up tonight

11:39.000 --> 11:40.583
and I'll haul her ass
back to New York.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.750
Or?

11:41.834 --> 11:44.625
Or you could arrange
a conversation.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.917
'This can go easy or hard.'

11:47.000 --> 11:50.625
Don't cop talk me, okay?'

11:52.959 --> 11:54.542
Your call, pal.

11:55.417 --> 11:57.250
I need some time.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.875
To talk to her.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.083
I got to see someone tomorrow.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.250
Day after?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.875
That should be good.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.667
It's gotta be.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.250
'Cause I ain't leaving
Philly without her.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.750
(John)
'Hey, Scotty,
Roy's aunt is here.'

12:34.667 --> 12:36.333
Yeah, okay.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.208
So what'd this New York
detective want?

12:46.083 --> 12:47.834
This girl I've been...with

12:47.917 --> 12:50.458
he's saying she did
credit card fraud.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.709
Which is crazy.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.041
Does Lill know this guy's
looking for her sister?

13:01.792 --> 13:03.458
Uh..

13:03.542 --> 13:05.333
Yeah.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.500
But, uh, she washed her hands.

13:08.583 --> 13:09.834
Uh-huh.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.667
Anyway, Chris just
needs to talk to
him

13:11.750 --> 13:14.500
sort it out.
He's got her
wrong.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.792
Long way to come
for getting it wrong, Scotty.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.375
Roy stayed with you
for three months in '77?

13:36.458 --> 13:40.542
Yes. Before the
difficulties
in New Jersey.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.792
The murders, you mean.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.667
We're looking into
a Philadelphia murder now.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.417
He didn't do that here.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.250
How do you know?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.458
I don't, I guess.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.041
'We think Roy may
have come in contact'

13:53.125 --> 13:55.834
with this man, Mike Cahill.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.083
Roy didn't mix
with people very much

14:01.166 --> 14:03.333
outside of his co-workers.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.083
Where'd he work?

14:05.166 --> 14:06.834
At the Franklin Grill.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.834
He was a busboy.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.583
Ever bring any friends home?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.750
He didn't make friends here.

14:13.792 --> 14:14.959
Did Roy ever
mention
anything to you

14:15.041 --> 14:17.291
about, uh, God's light?

14:18.917 --> 14:20.166
No.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.083
I wonder if..

14:23.166 --> 14:24.917
...he's the one who hurt Roy.

14:25.834 --> 14:26.959
Hurt him?

14:27.041 --> 14:29.959
He'd come home, late at night

14:31.000 --> 14:32.542
with injuries.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.083
From what?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.834
He'd never say.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.625
Roy, are you hurt again?

14:41.709 --> 14:43.625
Where do you go?
Who does this to you?

14:43.709 --> 14:45.333
Please let me in.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.792
- It hurts.
- Poor thing.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.917
Roy, do you remember
how Mary Magdalene

14:58.000 --> 15:00.458
poured oil on Jesus's
blistered feet?

15:00.542 --> 15:01.875
Yes.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.792
Well, that's what
I'm going to do for you
now.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.333
That feels good.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.625
One day, Roy,
maybe not so far from
now

15:11.709 --> 15:13.458
you'll meet a
nice,
wholesome girl

15:13.542 --> 15:16.208
and she'll touch you not
just on your hands, but..

15:17.208 --> 15:18.875
...here

15:18.959 --> 15:21.083
where it really counts.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.417
And it'll be alright
because she'll be good and
pure?

15:23.500 --> 15:24.875
Oh, yes, Roy.

15:24.959 --> 15:28.500
Only good and pure thoughts
come from a good and pure
girl.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.792
I think I'm going
crazy, Aunt Louise.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.166
Why do you say that?

15:34.250 --> 15:37.125
- I hear things.
- What kind of things?

15:37.625 --> 15:39.083
Voices.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.500
That's when I knew he was lost.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.208
You ever find out who hurt him?

15:48.291 --> 15:49.542
No.

15:51.709 --> 15:55.542
I probably should've
done more for him

15:55.625 --> 15:58.500
but late that summer
he ran away.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.709
I hate to admit it, but..

16:02.583 --> 16:04.166
I was relieved.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.750
Serial killer in the making

16:06.834 --> 16:08.333
that'd be a tough house guest.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.792
How lucky he didn't hurt you.

16:13.834 --> 16:15.542
Broke my heart.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.542
That hurt.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.083
Thank you for coming to me.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.125
I don't leave the apartment.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.959
I wouldn't either,
I lived like this.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.917
It's psychological, I'm afraid.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.458
Phobias.

16:37.542 --> 16:38.792
I got that.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.458
- About snakes.
- Oh.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.917
(Will)
'We're looking into
the murder of Mike Cahill.'

16:43.000 --> 16:44.792
He was your doorman back in '77.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.875
Oh, that dear boy. It was awful.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.083
What do you know about it?

16:48.166 --> 16:49.750
'Just what I read.'

16:49.834 --> 16:54.375
'Cause we kind of heard Mike
was more than just your
doorman.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.000
He was..

16:56.875 --> 16:58.041
...a friend.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.333
Keep goin'.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.041
'He was 15 years
younger than me.'

17:02.125 --> 17:03.291
(Nick)
'It's been done.'

17:03.375 --> 17:05.375
I'll be honest,
I wouldn't have said no

17:05.458 --> 17:08.667
but...it wasn't like that.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.750
Then why was he always
coming to see you late at
night?

17:11.834 --> 17:13.333
He was helping me.

17:13.417 --> 17:15.709
This was when my
agoraphobia
started.

17:15.792 --> 17:16.917
What's that?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.709
Fear of the outside.

17:18.792 --> 17:20.417
So Mike would
run errands for
me.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.166
- Like?
- Pharmacy runs.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.083
Cheesecake to go.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.875
And that's it?

17:26.959 --> 17:30.291
He would stay and keep me
company some nights.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.375
We'd play gin rummy.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.917
Your late husband
didn't know about your problem?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.333
Oh, I-I tried to
keep that from
him.

17:38.417 --> 17:41.417
I was hoping it was temporary.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.041
So did you see Mike
the day he died?

17:45.166 --> 17:47.417
He came to tell me
he was leaving.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.291
Don't cry, Helen.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.000
I never thought
you'd actually go.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.458
Gotta take that leap.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.000
Why does it have to be New York?

18:00.083 --> 18:01.709
You know why.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.542
- Kelly.
- She belongs on Broadway.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.333
Lucky girl.

18:09.417 --> 18:12.875
I want you to promise you'll
see a doctor, get some help.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.625
How can I make you
change your mind?

18:14.709 --> 18:16.000
You can't.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.500
Then..

18:20.333 --> 18:23.250
I have something for you.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.583
A Yemenis herder
came across a dancing goat

18:30.667 --> 18:32.917
eating red berries.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.625
He tried one and...

18:34.709 --> 18:37.166
...realized why
the
goat was dancing.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.834
And that's how
coffee was discovered.

18:39.917 --> 18:41.917
So the legend goes.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.750
It's for your coffee bar.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.959
Thank you, Helen.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.375
I'll be rooting for you.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.041
You gave him the goat.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.291
Last night of his life.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.375
This Kelly was his girlfriend?

19:04.458 --> 19:07.375
A waitress at the diner
where he'd get my cheesecake.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.250
What diner?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.375
The Franklin Grill.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.166
That's where Roy worked.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.041
(Christina)
'All I did was call in
some credit card numbers.'

19:24.125 --> 19:26.875
- Meaning you used them.
- No, he did. My boss.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.917
And was also your boyfriend.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.041
Greg. Yeah.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.792
So he was ripping off
his customers

19:31.875 --> 19:33.959
using their accounts
but you didn't know that.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.875
No, I didn't.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.750
I didn't, Scotty.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.417
So why is he telling
this Phillips it was your
idea?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.041
Because he's a liar.
He's pissed that I
broke--

19:42.125 --> 19:44.792
They got phone calls
with your voice on them,
Chris.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.959
I just said
I called in the
numbers.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.959
I'd been working
there for two
weeks.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.125
He gives me
these account numbers

19:52.208 --> 19:54.208
says, call them into Bendel's.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.542
- The department store.
- Said they had a standing
deal.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.375
They got flower
arrangements from us

19:58.458 --> 19:59.583
we got stuff from them.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.166
And that sounded legal to you?

20:01.250 --> 20:03.583
I don't know, Scotty.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.375
I was just trying
to keep the job.

20:10.625 --> 20:11.917
Well, if that's the truth,
all you gotta do

20:12.000 --> 20:13.208
is tell this guy.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.875
- It's the truth.
- Then meet with him.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.250
Straighten it out.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.625
Well, I hope he believes me
as much as you do.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.625
- I'll call him, set it
up.
- 'You'll be with me?'

20:21.709 --> 20:24.208
- Yeah. Of course.
- Then I'll be okay.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.834
Chris..

20:39.458 --> 20:41.083
I'm sorry.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.625
I do believe you.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.208
Okay.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.333
Larry Papas managed
the Franklin Grill in
'77.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.542
This is Lilly Rush.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.083
Roy Anthony worked for you?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.667
Gonna be on my tombstone

21:08.750 --> 21:10.333
he hired a serial killer.

21:10.417 --> 21:12.834
Mr. Papas also knew our victim.

21:12.917 --> 21:16.875
Mikey. Always gave me
grief about my bad coffee.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.000
So did Roy and Mike
meet at your diner?

21:19.083 --> 21:22.041
Not that I remember. If those
two met, it was through Kelly.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.333
- Mike's girlfriend.
- Waitress. Actress.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.500
I called her a wactress.

21:26.583 --> 21:27.834
'And your boy Roy?'

21:27.917 --> 21:30.000
- He had a real thing for
her.
- Really?

21:30.083 --> 21:31.208
Oh, mooned over her

21:31.291 --> 21:32.834
like she was a Madonna.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.625
So maybe he was jealous of Mike?

21:34.709 --> 21:37.375
I can't say for sure what was
going on in that kid's head.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.709
- He was off.
- Off how?

21:39.792 --> 21:40.875
'He was distracted.'

21:40.959 --> 21:43.291
Uptight. He had rules.
Real rigid.

21:43.375 --> 21:44.709
You remember what they were?

21:44.792 --> 21:47.959
Religious stuff.
Like don't disrespect the
Lord.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.875
His father told him that.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.375
Oh, that was big with him.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.041
Even if you crossed the line,
he'd have a cow.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.542
Gonna be busy tomorrow
with that Sunday school crowd.

21:59.625 --> 22:00.583
Always is.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.875
They come here after church?

22:01.959 --> 22:04.208
No. They come here
instead of church.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.750
- What?
- Sure.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.792
Their parents give 'em a buck
for the collection plate

22:07.875 --> 22:10.041
they sneak over here
and buy breakfast instead.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.542
- But that's disrespectful.
- Of their parents?

22:12.625 --> 22:14.375
- The Lord.
- Yeah.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.583
It's good for business, though.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.208
It's good to cheat God?

22:18.291 --> 22:20.291
Aw, come on. God's a rube.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.583
Roy, what are you doing?

22:27.792 --> 22:29.291
He shouldn't
disrespect the Lord.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.750
Okay, but you don't
gotta hurt yourself.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.834
Really. Relax, kid.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.417
Why did you do that?

22:35.500 --> 22:37.083
It was either hurt him or me.

22:40.667 --> 22:41.667
That feels good.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.750
Roy you're so sensitive.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.500
I can't help it.
I have these feelings.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.333
- Pent up, right?
- Right.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.208
And you need an outlet.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.375
You're so pure and good.

22:53.458 --> 22:55.291
I'm just like anyone else.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.208
No. You understand me.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.375
Roy, you know what you need?

23:01.458 --> 23:03.959
A late-night,
double-feature
picture show.

23:04.041 --> 23:06.000
- Okay.
- Maybe we'll go this
Saturday.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.250
So Roy gave himself
those injuries?

23:15.333 --> 23:17.959
He turned from hurting
himself to hurting others.

23:18.041 --> 23:19.458
Are you saying
he killed eight people

23:19.542 --> 23:21.125
'cause they cursed the Big Man?

23:21.208 --> 23:23.834
Well, maybe
a combination of
things.

23:23.917 --> 23:27.125
Were you wearing a
uniform
that day?

23:27.208 --> 23:28.959
My kitchen whites.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.959
Uniform,
plus disrespecting God..

23:31.041 --> 23:32.959
Equals burned hands.

23:33.041 --> 23:36.750
So what else gets thrown in
that turns it into murder?

23:41.208 --> 23:43.917
I never did make it to New York.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.834
I was still pretty
broken up over Mike.

23:46.917 --> 23:49.083
You remember a busboy
you worked with, Kelly?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.458
- A guy named Roy?
- Sure.

23:51.542 --> 23:54.500
From Utah. Kind of an oddball.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.333
An oddball that killed
a bunch of people, we think

23:56.417 --> 23:57.583
starting with Mike.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.834
No kidding?

24:02.875 --> 24:04.291
Oh, God.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.417
I introduced them that night.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
How did that go down?

24:08.583 --> 24:11.125
I took Roy to see
"The Rocky Horror Picture
Show."

24:11.208 --> 24:13.959
Roy Brigham Anthony
at "Rocky Horror?"

24:14.041 --> 24:16.291
It was midnight,
the Avenue Theater.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.542
I thought it'd broaden
his horizons, you know?

24:19.625 --> 24:21.208
And a movie could
do that for him?

24:21.291 --> 24:23.250
Oh, it's not just a movie,
it's an experience.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.250
Oh! It was..

24:25.333 --> 24:28.291
It was the time
of my life. I..

24:28.375 --> 24:30.417
I played Janet.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.000
I can see that.

24:33.917 --> 24:37.250
So Mike was at
this
experience, too?

24:37.333 --> 24:40.667
Yeah. He always came to watch.

24:40.750 --> 24:43.750
Except, that night
things went wrong.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.792
- Roy, meet Mike.
- 'Hi.'

25:01.917 --> 25:03.542
Why is he wearing those clothes?

25:03.625 --> 25:07.125
'Cause he's a transvestite
from Transsexual,
Transylvania.

25:07.208 --> 25:08.417
And an alien.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.500
Our God's from another planet.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.750
Near the Star Kola.

25:15.834 --> 25:17.667
Roy's a Mormon.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.458
Are you sure
we should be here, Kelly?

25:19.542 --> 25:21.500
Sure. I come every week.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.583
Another admirer, huh?

25:27.667 --> 25:29.250
He's just a lonely guy
from work.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.083
Wait till he sees you
in your big number.

25:31.166 --> 25:33.500
- Come on, Mike.
- Who am I kidding, Kel?

25:33.583 --> 25:35.083
You're so beautiful
and talented.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.458
'Don't do this.'

25:36.542 --> 25:38.542
I'm just a doorman
with a high school diploma.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.250
But you're gonna be
a businessman, a coffee tycoon.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.834
I'm gonna lose you in New York

25:42.917 --> 25:44.709
but you're gonna
get famous while I flop.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.667
I gotta do my number.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.750
I can't go, Kel.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.667
I'm sorry.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.375
Well, I'm going, Mike,
with you or without you.

26:11.458 --> 26:13.375
You choose.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.917
Come on, Roy.
Be my Rocky.

27:04.834 --> 27:07.375
Roy Brigham Anthony!

27:07.458 --> 27:09.125
Aunt Louise!

27:15.792 --> 27:17.375
Aunt Louise at "Rocky Horror?"

27:17.458 --> 27:19.333
Yeah. Ruined the whole number.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.750
What did you do when she
dragged away your
co-star?

27:21.834 --> 27:24.959
I left the stage,
left the theater

27:25.041 --> 27:26.500
and took the train home.

27:26.583 --> 27:27.834
Without Mike?

27:27.917 --> 27:29.917
He was still sitting
in the front row

27:30.000 --> 27:31.917
doubting himself, as usual.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.417
What train did you take, Kelly?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.917
Uh...the, uh...14.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.417
From the Tasker-Morris station.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.875
Where Mike was found.

27:40.959 --> 27:45.041
Uh-huh. I always wondered
if he followed me there.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.417
Maybe to say he was coming,
after all.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.166
It's possible.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.125
I'd like to think so, anyway.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.583
(John)
'Mike gets an ultimatum
from Kelly.'

28:01.667 --> 28:03.583
Maybe makes a decision,
goes after her.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.583
Which puts him at
the Tasker-Morris
stop.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.417
Yeah. But Roy's
with his Aunt Louise.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.000
Probably getting
a hell of an earful.

28:09.083 --> 28:12.417
So how does he end up
at the train platform
too?

28:12.500 --> 28:13.542
And what happened there

28:13.625 --> 28:15.875
makes him kill
for the first time?

28:17.709 --> 28:19.667
How late is she?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.208
Over an hour.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.542
- You told her 7:00, right?
- I told her.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.583
'Cause I got 8:30.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.333
What time you got?

28:51.041 --> 28:52.291
Something must have happened.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.125
Yeah. Like maybe she split.

28:54.208 --> 28:56.083
No. She said she'd be here.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.500
Did you clown me? Help her out?

28:59.583 --> 29:01.125
Careful what you ask me.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.709
Aw, screw cop to cop courtesy.

29:02.792 --> 29:04.250
I'm so whipped, I'll
do
anything for this--

29:04.333 --> 29:06.458
Keep going! Please! Anything!

29:09.875 --> 29:12.166
You been havin' rough times?

29:13.542 --> 29:14.667
What does that matter?

29:14.750 --> 29:15.834
Tryin' to figure
out
why you're off

29:15.917 --> 29:16.917
your game with this girl.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.208
Why you acting
like you know me?

29:18.291 --> 29:19.542
You're a cop.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.208
Skels lie to you every day.

29:21.291 --> 29:22.542
You should be wise to a con.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.709
Well, she ain't that!

29:26.583 --> 29:28.500
I been in that situation.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.500
Power of a pretty girl..

29:29.583 --> 29:30.959
You ain't hearing me, Phillips.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.458
I'll go get her, brink her back.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.125
I'll wait till 9:00.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.583
Then she becomes a fugitive.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.417
Chris?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.083
Christina?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.875
Ever seen "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show", Louise?

30:58.542 --> 31:00.000
Certainly not.

31:00.083 --> 31:01.417
No?

31:01.500 --> 31:03.083
That's for heathens.

31:03.166 --> 31:04.709
Well, the night Mike Cahill died

31:04.792 --> 31:07.291
one of those heathens
saw you at the theater

31:07.375 --> 31:09.125
spitting fire and brimstone.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.500
Is that a fact?

31:12.583 --> 31:14.625
Why not tell us that?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.750
- I couldn't.
- Because?

31:20.417 --> 31:22.542
Because I made a mistake
that night

31:24.083 --> 31:26.166
that I'll never
forgive myself for.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.166
What mistake was that?

31:30.291 --> 31:33.125
Louise, you're protecting
a serial killer.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.542
Don't you think I know that?

31:35.625 --> 31:38.208
I made him who he is.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.834
How?

31:42.083 --> 31:44.208
Roy called me and..

31:44.291 --> 31:47.458
...asked if he could go
to that so-called
entertainment.

31:47.542 --> 31:49.291
And you agreed?

31:49.375 --> 31:51.333
No. I said to come home.

31:51.417 --> 31:53.500
But he went anyway.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.667
He disobeyed.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.583
Because of that girl.

31:57.667 --> 31:58.792
Kelly Witkowski.

31:58.875 --> 32:02.208
He went astray
lusting for her.

32:03.417 --> 32:06.500
So you went to the
theater
to get him?

32:07.959 --> 32:11.041
And entered this den of sin..

32:12.333 --> 32:16.166
All these people
dancing in their
underwear.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.208
Including Roy.

32:19.792 --> 32:21.750
Especially Roy.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.166
You've committed
the ultimate sin,
Roy!

32:26.250 --> 32:27.792
You've turned away from God!

32:27.875 --> 32:29.083
No, I haven't, Aunt Louise!

32:29.166 --> 32:30.542
Dancing up there in
your
garmies?

32:30.625 --> 32:31.792
Cavorting with a harlot?

32:31.875 --> 32:33.667
She's not a harlot!
She's my Mary Magdalene.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.750
Roy Brigham Anthony!

32:35.834 --> 32:38.750
Do not compare that low woman
to God's disciple.

32:38.834 --> 32:40.375
No, Kelly's pure. Nice!

32:40.458 --> 32:42.542
A nice girl wouldn't
do
what she was doing

32:42.625 --> 32:45.000
outside the marriage bed.

32:45.083 --> 32:46.834
Then...I should marry her.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.375
That's the sinner talking.

32:48.458 --> 32:49.875
That's what got you
in trouble in Provo.

32:49.959 --> 32:52.375
But I want someone,
Aunt Louise. I'm so alone.

32:52.458 --> 32:56.792
You've got to listen to God,
Roy, or you'll be lost.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.709
Is that who talks to me?

32:58.792 --> 33:00.375
Who else?

33:00.458 --> 33:02.375
I thought the voice meant
I was crazy.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.667
Joseph Smith heard
an avenging voice.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.875
So did Brigham Young,
your namesake.

33:06.959 --> 33:08.333
And they weren't crazy.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.125
They were the fathers
of the Latter-day Saints!

33:13.917 --> 33:15.250
Then I'll listen.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.500
It would be a sin not to.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.333
I have to go find Kelly.

33:42.125 --> 33:44.875
Now do you see
why I'm
responsible?

33:46.542 --> 33:49.583
'Cause you told Roy to listen.

33:49.667 --> 33:53.125
I thought it was
God
speaking to him.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.750
But it was Satan.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.125
God shines a light, huh, Roy?

34:06.208 --> 34:07.834
Speaks to you?

34:08.750 --> 34:10.959
That's right.

34:11.041 --> 34:14.500
That sounds real holy
and righteous and all

34:14.583 --> 34:17.750
but I ain't bitin'.

34:17.834 --> 34:19.250
What?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.417
I don't buy this prophet act

34:21.500 --> 34:24.125
God talking. It's bogus.

34:24.208 --> 34:28.375
Watch out. Roy doesn't like
you disrespecting the Lord.

34:28.458 --> 34:31.792
You like thinking you're
some special messenger of God

34:31.875 --> 34:34.417
but you're just a
regular frustrated guy

34:34.500 --> 34:36.208
who wanted a girl.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.792
You obviously don't understand.

34:38.875 --> 34:41.250
You went after Kelly that night.

34:41.333 --> 34:42.625
Followed her to the subway.

34:42.709 --> 34:43.875
'Cause you liked her little show

34:43.959 --> 34:45.291
in the theater.
Wanted some more.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.250
But instead of Kelly
you found Mike.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.834
That's where it
all came together.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.208
- The perfect storm.
- I don't know what you mean.

34:51.291 --> 34:53.041
I mean, there was Mike
in his uniform.

34:53.125 --> 34:56.000
And maybe he broke your rules
and disrespected God.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.166
We know what that makes you do.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.291
Makes you want to do harm.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.500
And all the while

34:59.583 --> 35:01.583
there's that
little voice
talking.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.667
The one Aunt Louise
said to listen to.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.125
God's voice is not little.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.792
And now things
are really brewing.

35:08.875 --> 35:10.166
I do his work.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.333
You just needed one more thing

35:11.417 --> 35:12.542
to push it over the edge.

35:12.625 --> 35:14.250
What was the last
ingredient, Roy?

35:14.333 --> 35:16.291
- Look, I-I--
- Turned you into a killer?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.667
I've already told you that!

35:17.750 --> 35:20.125
What, that God's light crap?

35:20.208 --> 35:22.542
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.583
God's light is not..

35:25.834 --> 35:27.917
God's light is real!

35:28.041 --> 35:29.667
It's real!

35:39.792 --> 35:41.166
Kelly!

35:43.250 --> 35:44.875
Roy, what are you doing here?

35:44.959 --> 35:46.375
- Where's Kelly?
- Gone.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.333
- I have to speak to her.
- Yeah, me, too.

35:48.417 --> 35:50.208
- 'Now.'
- What's the big emergency?

35:50.291 --> 35:52.041
I have to marry her.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.667
Get in line, pal, I'm first.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.583
No, really. She's my Mary.

35:55.667 --> 35:56.917
She's going to New York, Roy

35:57.000 --> 35:58.458
and I'm going with her.

35:58.542 --> 35:59.583
You don't understand.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.083
Hey, watch the uniform.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.667
She's my Mary Magdalene.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.542
Who's that?

36:04.625 --> 36:07.709
Don't you read the
Bible?
Go to church?

36:07.792 --> 36:09.875
Look, Roy, I know
you're a Jesus freak--

36:09.959 --> 36:11.083
What?
