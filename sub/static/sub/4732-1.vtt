00:32.800 --> 00:34.800
I was in seventh grade...

00:34.900 --> 00:36.000
when I realized
I was invisible,

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
Well, not that kind of invisible,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.300
No, it was more like I was
just,you know, kind of,.,

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
Anonymous, A-N-O-N-

00:46.500 --> 00:48.800
I-M-O-U-S,

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Anonymous,

00:50.100 --> 00:51.300
I'm sorry, That's wrong,

00:51.400 --> 00:53.500
W-O-R-N-G, Wrong,

00:53.700 --> 00:56.100
It's not that I didn't try,

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
I mean, I was always a real...

00:57.400 --> 00:58.900
Loser,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.800
L-O-S-E-R, Loser,

01:04.000 --> 01:05.200
Homework for tomorrow...

01:05.300 --> 01:06.700
Of course,
when it came to love...

01:06.800 --> 01:08.800
Pass it on,

01:08.900 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, That sucked,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.200
S-U-C-K-E-D, Sucked,

01:15.300 --> 01:19.800
There was another thing
working against me,

01:19.900 --> 01:21.200
Hi,

01:21.300 --> 01:24.000
Hey, I'm Justin,
I live just next door...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.100
and, uh, my mom sent me over...

01:25.200 --> 01:26.700
with these brownies
or something,

01:26.900 --> 01:30.000
Oh, hi, I'm Kate,
W-We just moved here,

01:30.100 --> 01:32.000
I mean, duh- the boxes
and everything...

01:32.200 --> 01:34.400
Holy jama lama,

01:34.600 --> 01:37.200
KATE:
That other thing is... my mom,

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
Hi, I'm Lori,

01:42.800 --> 01:46.000
Um... I made these for you,

01:46.100 --> 01:48.100
Be careful; you're hot,
I mean...

01:48.200 --> 01:49.800
they're hot,

01:49.900 --> 01:51.000
So hot,

01:51.100 --> 01:53.600
She's never had any trouble
landing men,

01:53.700 --> 01:56.000
She's just had trouble keeping them,

01:56.100 --> 01:59.100
I used to keep track,
but I found it exhausting,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.100
So, I just call 'em all... Skip,

02:01.300 --> 02:02.200
Hi, Kate,

02:02.400 --> 02:04.900
I'm going... to be...
your new... father,

02:05.100 --> 02:06.500
Maybe we shouldn't...

02:06.600 --> 02:08.199
get ahead
of ourselves now, Skip,

02:08.300 --> 02:09.900
It's, uh, it's Steve, kiddo,

02:10.100 --> 02:11.800
Why do you keep calling me Skip?

02:11.900 --> 02:13.400
KATE:
Because, eventually...

02:13.500 --> 02:15.800
that's what they all do,

02:15.900 --> 02:18.700
It's happened so many times
that my mom's developed...

02:18.800 --> 02:20.900
a very mature reaction,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
A quick therapy session...
or two... or three...

02:25.100 --> 02:28.300
and then we pack up the car
and flee to another town,

02:28.400 --> 02:31.600
Okay, maybe being invisible
does have its advantages,

02:31.700 --> 02:32.400
LORI:
Excuse me!

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
Because, moving all the time...

02:34.300 --> 02:37.900
I never had to deal with the
whole ''awkward good-bye''thing,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
All right, guys, here we go,

02:40.100 --> 02:41.600
I'm open!

02:41.800 --> 02:44.000
here's me,

02:44.100 --> 02:46.400
It wasn't easy,
but in just a few short months...

02:46.500 --> 02:48.200
I went from
''sort of unknown''to...

02:48.300 --> 02:50.000
Are you a narc?

02:50.100 --> 02:52.400
But enough about me,

02:52.500 --> 02:53.800
This story isn't even about me,

02:53.900 --> 02:56.800
It's about him,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.500
John Tucker,

03:02.200 --> 03:05.100
Let's face it, He is the man,

03:05.200 --> 03:08.000
Captain of the basketball team,
his family's loaded...

03:08.000 --> 03:10.400
and he looks somewhere
between an Abercrombie model...

03:10.500 --> 03:11.600
and a Greek god,

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
Tucker!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Let's go,John!
Kill the Bobcats!

03:15.000 --> 03:18.500
Not real bobcats,
I mean, they're endangered,

03:36.100 --> 03:37.500
This is Carrie Schaefer,

03:37.600 --> 03:41.200
It's no question who's taking
the Kodiaks to State this year,

03:41.400 --> 03:43.100
John Tucker here,
also known as ''Tuck''...

03:43.300 --> 03:44.600
- ''T-Man,'' ''T-Dog...''
- T-Dog!

03:44.800 --> 03:46.200
...some people
call me ''T-Money''...

03:46.300 --> 03:48.200
but I'm best known
as ''El Capitan,''

03:48.300 --> 03:50.900
Ho-ho, Heather!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.200
Whoo-hoo!

03:57.400 --> 03:58.800
Shake it, baby!

03:58.900 --> 04:01.500
Short skirts equals talent, Yay,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Heather's hot!

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
Go, Kodiaks!

04:14.500 --> 04:16.200
Go Kodiaks!

04:18.600 --> 04:20.000
Hey, Table six,

04:22.800 --> 04:24.500
I remember the first time...

04:24.600 --> 04:26.800
I spoke toJohn Tucker,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.100
It's not like he blew me away
or anything,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.600
I mean,
I was totally in control,

04:30.700 --> 04:33.000
- Hi,
- Yes,

04:33.100 --> 04:34.500
I mean... no,

04:34.600 --> 04:37.600
I-I mean, y...

04:37.700 --> 04:40.800
I'm... not quite ready to order,

04:40.900 --> 04:42.100
Thanks,

04:42.200 --> 04:46.600
Please tell me
I did notjust curtsy,

04:46.800 --> 04:48.600
What was I thinking?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
Of course a guy like that
already has a girlfriend,

04:51.200 --> 04:52.400
That's Carrie Shaeffer,

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
Runs the school TVstation...

04:54.000 --> 04:55.800
not to mention
the Honor Society...

04:55.900 --> 04:57.400
Junior Achievers, 4-H Club...

04:57.500 --> 05:00.000
Future Filmmakers of America,
Big Sisters...

05:00.100 --> 05:02.800
Adopt-A-Shut-In, and...
I think that's it,

05:02.900 --> 05:04.600
I've decided to write
a children's book,

05:04.700 --> 05:06.800
Oh, and she's writing
a children's book,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.300
Mm! You are so sexy
when you speak French,

05:13.400 --> 05:16.800
Mm...

05:18.600 --> 05:22.600
Uh, do you guys...
want a minute?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.100
KATE:
Whoa, scratch that,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.500
He's got two girlfriends,

05:30.600 --> 05:32.100
That one's Heather,
head cheerleader,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.400
Sort of self-explanatory,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.800
And Molly's all...

05:34.900 --> 05:36.600
''Why don't
we 'Stomp, Fight, Roar?'''

05:36.700 --> 05:37.800
''Stomp, Fight, Roar?''

05:37.900 --> 05:39.800
I know!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.400
I mean, at halftime?
What a dud,

05:42.500 --> 05:45.700
Two green salads,
dressing on the side,

05:45.800 --> 05:48.200
Salmon for her,
Lobster for me,

05:48.300 --> 05:49.500
I love when you do that,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.700
I love doing that,

05:51.800 --> 05:54.100
I love that you love
that I love you doing that,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.900
And... no need to rush
between courses,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.100
That top...
looks so hot on you,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.300
I bet it's even hotter
off of you,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.500
JOHN:
Never been here before, babe...

06:09.600 --> 06:10.900
so I hope they have
good vegetarian,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.600
Okay, stop it already,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.000
Three girlfriends?

06:14.100 --> 06:15.400
JOHN:Oh, no! Veal?

06:15.500 --> 06:16.700
I'm sorry,
Let's just go,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.100
You know, if I wanted
to torture animals...

06:19.000 --> 06:20.300
I'd go to a medical lab,

06:20.400 --> 06:21.600
Hey,

06:21.700 --> 06:22.800
Which...

06:22.900 --> 06:25.600
I would never do, 'cause
they... torture animals,

06:25.700 --> 06:28.600
Okay, I'm not passing judgment...

06:28.700 --> 06:30.000
but, for whatever reason...

06:30.100 --> 06:33.400
being a vegan teen activist
is usually code for ''easy, ''

06:33.500 --> 06:36.000
You know, for you, I don't have
to give up all meat,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
See? I'm not making
this stuff up,

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
I don't get it,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.700
I mean, these girls all
seem so confident and cool,

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
How do they not know...

06:43.900 --> 06:45.500
thatJohn's cheating
on all of them?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.000
He's a total operator,

06:47.100 --> 06:49.000
He goes out with girls
from different cliques...

06:49.100 --> 06:51.200
so that they never
actually talk to each other,

06:51.300 --> 06:53.800
And then he
tells them that his father...

06:53.900 --> 06:55.900
won't let him date
during basketball season...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.700
so they'll have
to keep it a secret,

06:57.800 --> 06:59.400
How'd you learn all this stuff?

06:59.600 --> 07:03.900
I don't know,Just a guess,

07:07.300 --> 07:09.900
- Hey, there he is,
- Yo, bro,

07:12.100 --> 07:14.100
- He did?
- Yeah, totally,

07:14.200 --> 07:15.500
Hold on, one second,

07:15.600 --> 07:17.200
Hey, Yeah, actually...

07:17.400 --> 07:19.200
What's up, fellas?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.500
What's up, man?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.400
Yo, Tuck!

07:25.600 --> 07:28.300
Agua, please?
And some popcorn,

07:32.400 --> 07:34.000
What's up, girl?

07:34.200 --> 07:35.200
Hey,

07:35.400 --> 07:36.600
Lookin' good,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.800
Hey,Johnny,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.800
Hey,

07:50.900 --> 07:52.100
Hey,

07:58.100 --> 08:01.300
You got something sweet for me?

08:01.400 --> 08:03.000
Of course,

08:03.100 --> 08:06.200
I don't know,

08:15.800 --> 08:17.800
John was confident...

08:17.900 --> 08:19.700
in his system forjuggling girls...

08:19.800 --> 08:23.200
but even he couldn't anticipate
the events of Black Tuesday,

08:28.400 --> 08:30.000
Oh, my gosh!

08:30.100 --> 08:31.700
Coach Claypoole!
Are you all right?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.700
How was he to know...

08:33.799 --> 08:35.500
Coach Claypoole had acute angina?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.799
It wasn'tJohn's fault,

08:36.900 --> 08:39.200
It was a pre-existing condition,
and she stabilized...

08:39.299 --> 08:42.100
and took early retirement
in Sun City, Florida,

08:42.200 --> 08:43.500
John Tucker,

08:43.600 --> 08:45.100
Anyway, the point is...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.200
Coach Claypoole is
in the hospital...

08:47.400 --> 08:50.500
so we're combining
all first period gym classes,

08:51.700 --> 08:55.100
Yeah, yeah, I know,
We all hate each other,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.100
No, we hate you,

08:57.500 --> 09:00.100
Okay,Jennifer, Alison, Molly...

09:00.200 --> 09:03.400
Sarah, Denise and Kimmi, this side!

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
My name is Lucretia!

09:06.600 --> 09:10.100
On this side, I want Beth,
Carrie, Heather and...

09:10.000 --> 09:11.100
what's-your-face,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.800
I'm Kate, Kate,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
All right, ladies...
let's play ball!

09:16.500 --> 09:17.800
You're Heather, right?
I'm Kate,

09:17.900 --> 09:20.400
So?

09:20.600 --> 09:23.000
You weren't at the party last night,
Where were you?

09:23.100 --> 09:25.700
Well, this is totally on the DL,
I mean, not fit to print,

09:25.800 --> 09:30.200
I'm dating...John Tucker,

09:31.300 --> 09:32.800
Hey!

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Sorry, It slipped,

09:36.900 --> 09:39.300
Okay, All right, I'm fine,

09:39.400 --> 09:41.300
Okay, everybody, Let's play,

09:46.500 --> 09:47.900
You know what?

09:48.100 --> 09:49.800
That was no accident!

09:50.000 --> 09:51.200
He's mine!
Stay away from him!

09:51.300 --> 09:52.300
Oh, you little brat!

09:52.400 --> 09:54.800
Oh! Girls! Peace and love!
Come on!

09:54.900 --> 09:57.100
No guy is worth fighting over!
Stop!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.300
There's nothing to fight about!

09:58.400 --> 09:59.500
John Tucker's mine!

09:59.600 --> 10:00.500
Oh!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.800
What the hell is your problem?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.100
I am dating John Tucker,

10:07.400 --> 10:08.500
Enough!

10:08.600 --> 10:09.400
She knocked her out,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.000
Let's get back in the game,

10:16.100 --> 10:17.600
I said, ''Enough!''
Stop it, Beth,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.300
Darn it, Coach,
Let me at her!

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
-Just let me get them!
- Put those balls down!

10:23.500 --> 10:25.400
Put those balls down!
Put down those balls!

10:28.900 --> 10:30.300
Just stop!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.200
This guy is cheating on all of you...

10:41.300 --> 10:43.300
and instead of taking it out on him...

10:43.400 --> 10:45.200
you're beating the shit
out of each other?!

10:45.400 --> 10:46.300
Language!

10:47.500 --> 10:52.000
Detention,
You, you, you and you!

10:52.100 --> 10:53.600
Honestly,

10:57.500 --> 10:59.500
Who is that?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.000
I don't know,
Pam... something,

11:24.400 --> 11:25.600
Uh...

11:25.800 --> 11:27.500
Sorry, it's, uh...

11:27.600 --> 11:29.300
Cheap Trick, I understand,

11:29.400 --> 11:31.800
Yeah, Yeah, it is,

11:31.900 --> 11:33.800
Yeah, you can't really hum
to Cheap Trick,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.100
No, once you've started...

11:35.200 --> 11:37.900
you're kind of obligated to...
to belt it out,

11:39.200 --> 11:40.800
Yeah,

11:43.600 --> 11:45.000
I'm Scott,

11:45.200 --> 11:47.500
You're from...
Chemistry, right?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.400
Yeah, Yeah, I'm-I'm Kate,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.300
So, um, where is everybody?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.300
Detention?

11:57.400 --> 12:00.200
You-You came early
to detention?

12:01.700 --> 12:04.000
Oh, um, well, it's, you know...

12:04.100 --> 12:06.500
I would hate
to m-m-miss a minute...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.600
of being... detained,

12:10.900 --> 12:12.000
Hey, babe,

12:12.100 --> 12:13.400
Hey,John,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
I had a great time with
these two on the beach,

12:15.700 --> 12:17.100
Ugh...

12:17.000 --> 12:19.100
Oh, Wow,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.600
That's not, uh, usually
the reaction he gets from girls,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.200
It's generally more like a...

12:27.100 --> 12:28.600
Yeah, okay,

12:28.700 --> 12:30.300
''Jerk'' isn't really my type,

12:30.400 --> 12:31.600
Yeah, you're right,

12:31.700 --> 12:33.300
He can have his jerk moments,

12:33.400 --> 12:36.600
Oh, I thought he was you
guys'... god, or whatever,

12:36.800 --> 12:39.300
You're close,
He's my older brother,

12:39.400 --> 12:42.800
Oh, You're the other Tucker?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.200
What is that? Is that, like,
''the loser Tucker''?

12:44.300 --> 12:46.800
Oh, no, no,
That's not what I meant,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.600
I just... you just don't look...

12:49.800 --> 12:52.900
Hot, buff, or capable of
inciting an all-girl smackdown?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.200
No, you're right,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.300
Naw, it's-it's cool,

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
I'll let you in on a secret, though,

12:57.600 --> 12:59.000
My mom...

12:59.100 --> 13:02.600
says I'm special on the inside,

13:04.100 --> 13:05.900
Good for you,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
Yeah,

13:11.400 --> 13:13.300
John? Can I talk to you for a sec?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, sure,

13:15.100 --> 13:16.400
Later, guys,

13:16.600 --> 13:18.100
Later, man,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.400
So, what's up?

13:19.500 --> 13:23.000
In PE today, some loser said
that she went out with you,

13:23.100 --> 13:27.000
Really?
And you believed her,

13:27.100 --> 13:28.600
No, I mean, I don't know,

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
You can't have a girlfriend...

13:30.900 --> 13:32.500
...in basketball season,

13:32.600 --> 13:33.900
But...

13:34.000 --> 13:38.600
if I could...
you know who it'd be,

13:48.800 --> 13:52.100
You know, I don't know why
girls say stuff like that,

13:52.200 --> 13:54.100
I mean, I think they're just...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.400
jealous of what we have,

13:55.500 --> 13:57.400
Because we share
something special,

13:57.600 --> 13:59.000
Something we don't have to label,

13:59.100 --> 14:00.800
You know, it's...
it's an unspoken bond,

14:00.900 --> 14:02.000
And I love how secure you are,

14:02.100 --> 14:03.800
All right,

14:03.900 --> 14:05.800
Detention has begun,

14:05.900 --> 14:07.200
I'll be right back,

14:07.300 --> 14:08.800
And no talking!

14:09.000 --> 14:11.500
So, I talked toJohn,

14:11.600 --> 14:12.900
It was sweet,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.400
He felt bad for you,

14:14.600 --> 14:16.800
He said that you were jealous because...

14:17.000 --> 14:18.400
we share something special,

14:18.600 --> 14:19.700
Something that...

14:19.800 --> 14:21.000
we didn't have to label
because it's...

14:21.200 --> 14:22.500
Because it's our unspoken bond...

14:22.600 --> 14:25.700
and I just love
how secure you are?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.700
And it hurts me to hear
you question it?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.000
Because you're the...

14:29.000 --> 14:30.100
...only girl for me?!

14:31.400 --> 14:33.100
Damn!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
He said the same thing
to all of us,

14:35.100 --> 14:36.300
Figures, He makes up with us...

14:36.400 --> 14:38.000
and then he hooks up with us...

14:38.100 --> 14:38.900
You guys hooked up?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
John and I share
something special,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.500
Oh, what, that you've both
been in your pants?

14:43.600 --> 14:46.800
We share a vegan/nonviolent
outlook on life,

14:46.900 --> 14:48.400
Hippie slut,

14:48.600 --> 14:49.900
Oh, nice, Heather,

14:50.100 --> 14:51.400
It's not like everyone
doesn't know...

14:51.500 --> 14:53.100
that Little Miss Cheerleader
brings it on,

14:53.200 --> 14:54.900
- Look...
- You, too?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.200
-John and I belong together,

14:57.300 --> 14:59.200
He is the team captain,
and I am...

14:59.300 --> 15:00.500
the head cheerleader,

15:00.600 --> 15:01.800
Oh, I'm sorry...

15:01.900 --> 15:03.000
what kind of cheerleader?

15:03.100 --> 15:05.000
Oh, like he'd take
either of you two seriously!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.100
- Do not lump me with her!
- Oh, so, what...

15:06.200 --> 15:08.100
- now you're better than me?
- Shut up,

15:08.200 --> 15:10.300
- What?
- Excuse me?
- What?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.600
Sorry, S-Sorry,

15:13.700 --> 15:14.800
You have something to say?

15:14.900 --> 15:15.900
Uh...

15:16.000 --> 15:17.600
No, it's none of my business,

15:17.700 --> 15:18.400
What?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.100
Okay, let me guess,

15:22.300 --> 15:25.200
Does he always use pet names
like ''baby''...

15:25.300 --> 15:26.600
and ''sweetheart''?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.400
Yeah, it's not out of affection,

15:28.500 --> 15:30.200
It's so he won't mix up your names,

15:30.300 --> 15:34.000
And-And he's all about
an unspoken bond...

15:34.100 --> 15:36.400
or something special,
but never about a relationship,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.200
A-And the whole arrangement
was your idea...

15:38.300 --> 15:40.400
so you feel guilty
that he cheated,

15:40.600 --> 15:43.400
Oh, my God,
You're dating John, too,

15:43.500 --> 15:44.800
No, uh...

15:44.900 --> 15:47.200
No, I just knew a guy like him,

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
Skip,

15:49.300 --> 15:51.600
She's right, I mean,
he's always making me feel guilty,

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
- Yeah,
- It seems to me...

15:52.900 --> 15:54.600
that if a guy treats you
like that, it...

15:54.700 --> 15:56.500
You'd break up with him,
Blah-blah-blah-blah,

15:56.600 --> 15:58.600
John would have another
girlfriend in a second,

15:58.700 --> 16:00.000
No, I didn't say, ''break up,''

16:00.100 --> 16:02.400
I'd get even,

16:03.900 --> 16:05.000
Who are you?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
I know!

16:06.600 --> 16:09.100
You're that girl who wigged out
last year and got sent to rehab!

16:09.200 --> 16:11.000
No, I...

16:11.100 --> 16:12.400
Then you got taken away
for bulimia,

16:12.600 --> 16:13.700
- No,
- Fat camp?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
- No, My name's...
- Hey! No talking!

16:18.100 --> 16:20.100
- My name is...
- No... talking!

16:31.400 --> 16:32.600
Hey, honey!

16:32.700 --> 16:33.800
I'm in a hurry,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.200
I've got a...
big date tonight,

16:36.300 --> 16:37.600
Drummer?

16:37.700 --> 16:38.600
Doctor,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.100
Well, veterinarian,

16:41.200 --> 16:42.700
Technician,

16:42.800 --> 16:44.600
- So you're dating a dog nurse,

16:44.700 --> 16:49.000
You've...
got a friend at the door,

16:49.100 --> 16:51.200
What?!

16:58.000 --> 17:00.700
LORI:
Have fun, girls!

17:00.800 --> 17:02.200
Kate, right?

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
Yeah, Kate,

17:04.599 --> 17:07.000
I wanna bring down
you-know-who,

17:07.099 --> 17:09.599
Normally I'm opposed to
the slaughter of animals...

17:09.700 --> 17:12.000
but in John Tucker's case,
I'll make an exception,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.300
I don't even know him,

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
So? You don't know anyone,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.800
You're like the Swiss,
You're neutered,

17:17.900 --> 17:19.400
Uh, it's neutral,
Kate, if the three of us...

17:19.500 --> 17:21.099
tried this alone,
we would kill each other,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.099
You brought us here,
You showed us that we have...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.099
something in common,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.800
Exactly,
We all wanna killJohn Tucker,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.800
Wow,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.000
Okay,

17:34.100 --> 17:35.700
Learning Center?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.100
Who knew this was here?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.700
Look at him, struttin' his
stuff like he owns the place,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.800
Well, he does,

17:41.900 --> 17:42.900
For now,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.700
This way,

17:45.800 --> 17:47.300
Don't touch anything,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.000
Wow,

17:49.200 --> 17:52.400
You spend way too much time
in after-school programs,

17:52.500 --> 17:55.100
Thank you,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Beth, can you get the lights?

17:57.100 --> 18:00.800
It's the remote...
labeled ''lights,''

18:00.900 --> 18:04.000
Okay, guys, Let's go,

18:04.100 --> 18:08.200
Please try and pay attention,
and all cell phones off,

18:08.400 --> 18:10.100
Kate... do your thing,

18:10.300 --> 18:13.200
My thing? Oh, okay,

18:13.300 --> 18:16.800
What... is it
that attracted you toJohn...?

18:16.900 --> 18:18.400
Kate, I like where
you're going with this,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.400
Okay, girls, we need
to defineJohn,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.100
He's a statue
wrapped in a painting...

18:22.200 --> 18:23.600
in a frame made of muscles,

18:23.700 --> 18:25.000
But what makes him tick?

18:25.100 --> 18:27.100
Is it that charm?
Is it that smile?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Is it that perfect tan?

18:28.100 --> 18:31.500
What is it, girls?
Dig deep,

18:31.600 --> 18:33.000
It's everything,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.800
It's his eyes...

18:36.000 --> 18:39.200
his lips,
his chest, the...

18:39.300 --> 18:40.800
the way that,
when he holds you...

18:40.900 --> 18:42.200
his whole body
kinda tightens...

18:42.300 --> 18:44.600
Uh, we all know what happens
when boys get happy,

18:44.800 --> 18:45.600
Not what I meant!

18:45.800 --> 18:48.000
You guys,
save it forJohn, okay?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.100
Look, back to the point,
We all agree he's hot,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.100
So, what do we do?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.800
Well, in cheer, we usually
tear down the other team...

18:54.900 --> 18:57.600
by undermining their confidence,
makin' 'em feel lame,

18:57.700 --> 18:59.200
I don't think
this is a case for...

18:59.300 --> 19:01.000
''U-G-L-Y, you ain't
got no alibi,''

19:01.100 --> 19:02.200
Shut up,

19:02.400 --> 19:05.400
Heather, as much as I hate to
admit this... you have a point,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.000
Right,

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
And-And sinceJohn's game is
that he always has a date...

19:11.100 --> 19:15.600
to get even with a guy like that,
you make him... undatable,

19:15.700 --> 19:17.900
Yes,

19:18.100 --> 19:19.100
- Undatable,

19:19.300 --> 19:20.900
A systematic destruction...

19:21.000 --> 19:23.100
of all that is John Tucker,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.400
Girls... I think
I have an idea,

19:28.500 --> 19:29.600
I'm telling you, babe...

19:29.800 --> 19:31.800
you could make your
looks work for you,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.300
Don't you think, Robert?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
You know, Robert
knows my mom...

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
and he shoots for
Vogue, Elle, GQ,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
And of course he's done...

19:39.000 --> 19:42.100
all my yearbook photos since
middle school on recycled paper,

19:42.200 --> 19:43.600
Okay,John,

19:43.700 --> 19:45.600
The trick is just relax...

19:45.700 --> 19:47.200
and behave naturally, yeah?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.600
Now pout for me,John! Pout!

19:48.800 --> 19:51.400
More pouting, yeah!
Oh, yeah, I love you,

19:51.600 --> 19:53.000
I love you,
Now make me hate you!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.200
Hate me! Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

19:54.300 --> 19:56.600
Oh, you hate me!
Oh, you hate me,John!

19:56.800 --> 19:58.200
Nice, nice, nice!
Now you're a tree,

19:58.300 --> 19:59.800
It's windy,
Shake your branches!

19:59.900 --> 20:00.900
- Big storm,John,
- It's good,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.300
Big storm, Bigger,
bigger, bigger,

20:02.400 --> 20:03.300
Now hate me,John,

20:03.400 --> 20:04.100
Hate me,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.100
Oh, you hate me,John!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It is so amazing that
you're into sculpture,

20:10.200 --> 20:13.100
I mean, what are human beings
here for if not to, you know...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.800
make... horses and stuff
out of clay?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Really? I'm so glad
you feel that way,

20:18.100 --> 20:20.100
Totally,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.900
Hey, isn't that you?

20:23.100 --> 20:25.800
I do some part-time
male modeling,

20:25.900 --> 20:27.000
- Really?
- Yeah,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
I didn't know that,

20:30.100 --> 20:32.000
-Can I have a sip?
- Yeah,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.100
I know that guy!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.300
Um...

20:36.400 --> 20:38.000
What?! No, I...

20:38.100 --> 20:40.000
I don't have that,

20:47.100 --> 20:49.800
Holly... I-I-I
don't have that!

20:49.900 --> 20:51.400
God, ooh,
Don't touch me,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.300
- Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
- Holly, wait!

20:53.400 --> 20:55.700
Holly!

20:55.900 --> 20:57.900
That's him!

20:58.100 --> 20:59.500
What? No, that's not real,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.800
I only model
as a guy with herpes,

21:06.100 --> 21:07.500
Goin' to the free clinic, Tuck?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.800
Rule #1 in warfare;

21:09.900 --> 21:14.200
Never underestimate
your opponent,

21:14.300 --> 21:15.700
Oh, I love you, Tucker!

21:15.800 --> 21:18.600
I don't personally suffer
from an STD...

21:18.700 --> 21:20.500
but one in five young adults do,

21:20.600 --> 21:24.400
And I am proud to give my voice
to the silent,

21:26.100 --> 21:28.000
That's right, baby!

21:36.700 --> 21:39.000
- Thanks!

21:39.200 --> 21:40.800
Okay, it should've worked,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.800
I mean,
are we missing something?

21:42.900 --> 21:44.700
- I am, My social life,
- Hey!

21:44.800 --> 21:46.000
Hey, Ms, Spencer,

21:46.100 --> 21:47.100
''Lori,'' please,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
So, what are you girls up to?

21:49.100 --> 21:52.000
- Destroying a man,
- Ooh, who do I make my check out to?

21:52.100 --> 21:53.200
He's totally indestructible,

21:53.300 --> 21:56.400
We give him herpes,
they give him an award,

21:56.600 --> 21:58.700
Fake herpes, Mom, N...

21:58.800 --> 22:01.100
It was a whole reputation thing,

22:01.200 --> 22:02.600
It's a long story,

22:02.800 --> 22:06.100
Sure, Yeah, the old ''fake herpes,
reputation...'' thing,

22:06.200 --> 22:07.300
You know, um...

22:07.400 --> 22:10.700
I can unpack the groceries
if you've got... stuff,

22:10.800 --> 22:12.100
I get it, All right,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.500
Play nice, girls, Hmm,

22:16.200 --> 22:19.700
Okay, your mom is so hot!

22:19.800 --> 22:20.800
She does Yogalates,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.600
Carrie, what are you
always typing on there?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.800
Oh, lists...
normal stuff, same as everyone,

22:25.900 --> 22:28.600
I have my ''To Do'' list,
my ''Goals'' list...

22:28.800 --> 22:30.300
my ''Contingency'' list,
my ''Observations''...

22:30.400 --> 22:32.500
my ''Notions,'' which, of course,
are very different...

22:32.600 --> 22:34.000
because ''Observations'' require
a topic sentence...

22:34.100 --> 22:35.600
and ''Notions'' do not,

22:35.800 --> 22:37.700
Normal stuff,

22:37.900 --> 22:39.000
Right, Normal,

22:39.200 --> 22:40.100
Totally,

22:40.200 --> 22:43.100
Well, at least
I'm not medicated,

22:43.200 --> 22:45.200
Excuse me, This is an
all-natural beauty supplement,

22:46.300 --> 22:48.300
What are you taking?

22:49.800 --> 22:52.100
Estrogen? Heather!

22:52.000 --> 22:53.700
They torture innocent
horses for this,

22:53.800 --> 22:55.200
It's made from their pee,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.300
Peeing isn't torture,
Menopause is,

22:57.400 --> 22:59.300
I steal it from my mom,

22:59.400 --> 23:01.000
Guys take steroids to get pecs,

23:01.200 --> 23:03.000
I just wanna go up a cup size,

23:03.100 --> 23:05.100
I don't think
it works like that,

23:05.200 --> 23:06.400
It stops your natural
hormone production,

23:06.600 --> 23:07.600
Yeah, and when you run out...

23:07.700 --> 23:09.800
you're gonna grow
a mustache and a penis,

23:09.900 --> 23:11.400
Are you serious?

23:11.600 --> 23:14.100
Okay, you guys,
we've gotta get back toJohn,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.100
Okay, What we need
is one major hit...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.900
that's gonna crush his whole
macho thing, you know?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.600
We need him to understand
what it feels like to be us,

23:21.700 --> 23:23.000
Right,

23:23.100 --> 23:26.600
And what's more terrifying
to a man than...

23:26.700 --> 23:29.000
not being manly?

23:32.400 --> 23:35.000
I wanna see a three-man weave
from center,

23:35.000 --> 23:36.600
Two hands, Matt,

23:36.700 --> 23:37.800
You, too, Chris,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.400
All right, keep it goin' now!

23:39.500 --> 23:41.100
All right, here we go,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.400
Alex, you, too,
Come on, Pick it up,

23:45.500 --> 23:47.000
Better, Tucker,

23:49.500 --> 23:50.600
Take a drink, you guys,

23:53.200 --> 23:55.000
What's up, babe?

23:55.200 --> 23:56.000
Hey,

23:56.200 --> 23:57.400
How you doin'?

23:57.500 --> 23:58.400
Good,

24:01.200 --> 24:02.800
Um, are you tryin' to bulk up?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.100
Yeah, Coach has me
drinkin' 'em twice a day,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.100
Oh... not working,

24:08.200 --> 24:11.200
I mean, the slim look works
for some guys, but...

24:11.300 --> 24:13.400
you're definitely losing tone,

24:13.500 --> 24:15.700
I'm losing tone?

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Yeah, Maybe you should
double up doses,

24:16.800 --> 24:19.100
Yeah, Maybe you should
double up doses,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.600
Yeah, Yeah, Thanks for
the heads-up, babe,

24:40.400 --> 24:41.400
Hey,

24:41.500 --> 24:42.600
Oh,

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
Hey,

24:43.900 --> 24:45.400
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

24:45.600 --> 24:47.400
Uh, I'm-I'm in need
of a lab partner,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.200
I was with Alex, but...

24:49.400 --> 24:52.400
he got burnt pretty badly
in an experiment, so...

24:52.600 --> 24:55.300
Oh, Well, before I say yes...

24:55.400 --> 24:57.600
how exactly did he get burned?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.300
Uh, well, that is open
to interpretation...

25:00.400 --> 25:04.400
because he will say that it was
my fault, but I clearly said...

25:04.500 --> 25:06.400
''Dear God, man, you're on fire,

25:06.600 --> 25:07.800
Run for your life,''

25:07.900 --> 25:08.800
A clear warning,

25:08.900 --> 25:10.000
Yeah,

25:10.100 --> 25:12.000
Okay, Well, uh,
you can start by measuring...

25:12.200 --> 25:15.800
40 milliliters into that
graduated cylinder,

25:15.900 --> 25:17.600
All right,

25:20.900 --> 25:22.400
Whoa, Slow down,

25:22.600 --> 25:23.900
Huh? All right,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.100
Get down at eye level,

25:25.200 --> 25:28.100
And wait till the bottom of
the meniscus is at that line,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.100
I'm-I'm sorry,
The meniscus?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Wait till the curvy part
is at the doodad,

25:33.100 --> 25:36.000
All right,

25:36.100 --> 25:37.200
Slowly,

25:37.300 --> 25:41.800
Stop right... there,

25:41.900 --> 25:42.800
- Oh!
- Oh!

25:42.900 --> 25:43.800
Oh, God! I...

25:43.900 --> 25:45.000
Oh, my gosh!

25:45.100 --> 25:46.800
Shit, I spilled it!
What do I do? What is this?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.200
- Sodium chloride suspension,
- Oh, God, I have to get...

25:48.400 --> 25:49.400
- Ow, it's burning,
- Really?

25:49.500 --> 25:50.900
'Cause, uh, sodium chloride
is... saltwater,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Ah, it's burning!

25:55.200 --> 25:56.400
Oh, Well, okay,

25:56.600 --> 25:59.000
Then I didn't burn myself,

25:59.100 --> 26:02.000
It just kinda...
looks like I peed,

26:02.100 --> 26:03.200
- Hey!

26:03.300 --> 26:06.100
Hey, all right, All right,
This is just silly!

26:06.200 --> 26:07.200
This is...

26:07.300 --> 26:09.000
Hey! Cool it,

26:09.100 --> 26:10.200
Yeah, Kate,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.500
Geez, cool it,

26:22.800 --> 26:23.900
What?

26:37.700 --> 26:39.500
Lay off,
That's sensitive,

26:39.600 --> 26:41.100
I'm sorry, princess,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.600
Did you chip a nail?
Really, how many times do I...

26:43.700 --> 26:45.000
have to flush
before you go away?

26:45.100 --> 26:47.100
Play clean,

26:47.200 --> 26:50.400
Hey, if I wanted to listen to
an asshole, I would've farted,

26:50.500 --> 26:52.200
That's an awful thing to say,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.600
We got a technical foul:
23 with a push,

26:56.700 --> 27:00.600
He started it,
He's bein' mean,

27:05.700 --> 27:09.200
Dude, that's mine!
I got low blood sugar!

27:09.300 --> 27:10.300
I need it,

27:10.400 --> 27:12.800
Do my thighs look fat
in these shorts?

27:14.200 --> 27:17.600
De-fense! De-fense!

27:19.000 --> 27:20.100
John!

27:20.200 --> 27:21.100
John!

27:21.200 --> 27:22.200
Come on,John!

27:22.300 --> 27:24.000
What? Why are you
lookin' at me like that?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.000
I'm open!

27:26.100 --> 27:27.800
Fine!

27:27.900 --> 27:30.300
You see?
Now look what you made me do,

27:33.300 --> 27:35.200
- Time, ref,

27:37.100 --> 27:38.800
John, you okay?

27:38.900 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, Why?
Don't I look okay?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.600
'Cause I feel okay,
I feel fine,

27:43.800 --> 27:46.100
I'm great,
What are you saying?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.300
I'm saying focus,

27:47.400 --> 27:49.900
We got one minute left on
the clock to finish this game,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.900
I'm in it,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.400
On three, One-two-three...

27:54.500 --> 27:56.000
ALL:
Kodiaks!

28:15.300 --> 28:17.600
Tucker,
Tucker, are you okay?

28:17.700 --> 28:19.600
Can you finish the game?

28:19.700 --> 28:20.900
No,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.200
I-I-I'm anxious and bloated...

28:23.300 --> 28:25.400
and...my nipples hurt,

28:25.600 --> 28:27.000
Don't be a pansy-ass!

28:27.100 --> 28:28.900
We need ya,
Get up, Let's go,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
No! I won't!

28:32.200 --> 28:34.000
I mean, i-i-it's always me,

28:34.200 --> 28:36.000
''W-W-We need you,John,
Let's go,John,

28:36.200 --> 28:37.600
John-John-John!''

28:37.800 --> 28:39.300
You're always yelling at me...

28:39.400 --> 28:41.600
but you never listen to me,

28:41.800 --> 28:43.600
What about my feelings?

28:47.800 --> 28:50.200
It was a kill-strike...

28:50.300 --> 28:51.700
Leave me alone!

28:51.800 --> 28:54.300
...and it landed
with shock and awe,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.000
Thanks to us,
girls would no longer be...

28:56.200 --> 28:58.100
under the reign
ofJohn Tucker's charm,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.600
He had finally fallen
from grace...

29:00.700 --> 29:02.200
and we were
on top of the world,

29:02.300 --> 29:03.000
Bye, guys!

29:03.100 --> 29:05.400
Yo, what's up, guys?

29:08.300 --> 29:10.000
Tommy,

29:10.100 --> 29:12.400
Mm-mm, mm-mm,

29:19.500 --> 29:22.800
What you did
on the court last night...

29:22.900 --> 29:26.000
was the most courageous thing
I've ever seen any man do,

29:27.100 --> 29:29.500
This is my peer-counseling hotline,

29:29.600 --> 29:31.800
Give it a call
anytime you want to talk,

29:33.100 --> 29:35.000
I stay up late,

29:40.400 --> 29:41.800
A real man knows how to feel,

29:41.900 --> 29:45.100
I want to feel a real man,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
If you ever need a shoulder
or a hug or, you know...

29:48.200 --> 29:50.200
anything... I'm here,

29:51.600 --> 29:53.600
Rule #2 in warfare;

29:53.800 --> 29:56.200
never, ever,
underestimate your opponent,

29:56.400 --> 29:58.000
Hey, sweetie,
Can we talk?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.500
Look... I know
I wigged out last night,

30:00.600 --> 30:03.200
My peer counselor says
I need to look into...

30:03.300 --> 30:05.000
my emotional responsibility,

30:05.100 --> 30:07.400
So, I've been doing
some ''me'' work...

30:07.600 --> 30:10.000
and, uh, it's really been
clearing things up,

30:10.200 --> 30:11.500
Hmm,

30:11.600 --> 30:15.200
And, well, you know there's
only one girl for me,

30:15.400 --> 30:18.300
But... I don't think
that girl is you,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.600
I mean, we had a fun run,

30:20.700 --> 30:22.100
You know?
I'm just ready to find...

30:22.000 --> 30:24.700
something deeper, more complex,

30:24.800 --> 30:26.500
So... we good?

30:39.200 --> 30:42.300
Well... he dumped me,

30:42.400 --> 30:45.400
That shallow bastard
thinks I'm not complex?

30:45.600 --> 30:47.200
You, like, invented complex,

30:47.300 --> 30:50.400
I'm so depressed, I couldn't
even enjoy the break-up sex,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Oh, my God, I'm such a slut!

30:55.100 --> 30:56.000
Ow!

30:56.200 --> 30:57.600
- Oh, God!

30:59.000 --> 31:01.100
I can't believe
I ate meat for him,

31:01.100 --> 31:02.600
I mean, it was fish...

31:02.800 --> 31:04.900
Still, I don't eat anything
with a face,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.200
Mm, try this,
It's really good,

31:06.300 --> 31:08.100
Chocolate on chocolate,

31:08.200 --> 31:09.400
Oh, yeah,

31:09.600 --> 31:14.300
Chocolate is theJohn Tucker...
of all snack food,

31:14.400 --> 31:16.800
What, it's gotta get with
every candy on the shelf?

31:16.900 --> 31:18.600
No, no, no, chocolate makes
everything better,

31:18.700 --> 31:21.300
My mom says that it can even
mend your broken heart,

31:21.400 --> 31:23.600
You know, I was thinking...

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
instead of doing all this...

31:25.900 --> 31:28.600
we should've just
broken his heart,

31:28.700 --> 31:31.100
What?

31:31.300 --> 31:34.000
Heather, that's pretty genius,

31:34.100 --> 31:37.000
Yeah, except he broke up
with everybody,

31:37.100 --> 31:41.000
Not... everybody,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.800
What? I...

31:43.900 --> 31:45.300
- No,
- Mm-hmm,

31:45.400 --> 31:46.600
I can't do that,

31:46.800 --> 31:48.000
- I don't even like him,
- So?

31:48.100 --> 31:50.000
You're not really
gonna be dating him,

31:50.100 --> 31:51.400
You'll be pretending,

31:51.500 --> 31:52.400
Exactly,

31:52.500 --> 31:53.700
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

31:53.800 --> 31:55.400
''I'm not as pretty as Heather,

31:55.500 --> 31:56.700
''I'm not that smart,

31:56.800 --> 31:58.300
''I'm not that...

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
experienced,''

32:01.900 --> 32:02.600
That's true,

32:02.800 --> 32:04.000
But you have us,

32:04.100 --> 32:07.600
And we can make you into anything,
If we combine...

32:07.800 --> 32:10.100
all of us, we can make him
fall in love with you-

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I mean really fall in
love- and then we'll...

32:12.100 --> 32:13.300
yank it all out from under him,

32:13.400 --> 32:15.300
This is gonna be so good!

32:15.400 --> 32:17.700
No, it's just not gonna work, I...

32:17.800 --> 32:19.000
Kate, look...

32:19.100 --> 32:22.000
I know you think I'm just
a superficial cheerleader...

32:22.100 --> 32:23.300
but... I do have feelings...

32:23.400 --> 32:25.800
and they got crushed
because of your idea,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.400
I used all my mom's
estrogen pills...

32:28.500 --> 32:30.100
and now she looks
like Bernie Mac,

32:31.600 --> 32:33.400
Sorry,

32:33.500 --> 32:35.000
You guys, I...

32:35.100 --> 32:36.400
You know what? Forget it,

32:36.600 --> 32:38.200
You couldn't pull it off anyway,

32:38.400 --> 32:39.900
Let's go,

32:40.000 --> 32:40.700
Oh, well,

32:40.800 --> 32:41.700
All right,

32:41.800 --> 32:43.200
Wait,

32:44.300 --> 32:46.900
Just tell me what to do,

32:47.000 --> 32:47.900
- Yes!
- Oh!

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
- Ha!

32:49.200 --> 32:51.300
Now, the first step is so easy,

32:51.400 --> 32:55.000
There's one thing
John Tucker cannot resist,

32:55.100 --> 32:56.200
Okay, girls, This is Kate...

32:56.300 --> 32:58.000
and she'll be
taking Nancy's spot,

32:58.100 --> 33:00.000
- What?
- Well, you know, you've...

33:00.000 --> 33:01.600
got that bum leg
and everything, Sorry!

33:01.700 --> 33:02.800
But it's just a sprain,

33:02.900 --> 33:04.700
The doctor said
I'd be better in a week,

33:04.800 --> 33:06.400
Maybe next year, kiddo,
You fought a good fight, though,

33:06.600 --> 33:09.600
Okay, pyramid!
Kate, you're on top,

33:09.700 --> 33:12.100
What? No, no, no,
I get dizzy in high heels,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.400
Come on!

33:13.500 --> 33:15.400
John loves girls on top,

33:15.600 --> 33:17.600
Of the pyramid! Hello!

33:17.700 --> 33:19.200
Trust me, it's an honor,

33:19.300 --> 33:22.400
Molly's been waiting
three years to get up there,

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
Right, Molly?

33:24.700 --> 33:26.000
Yeah, you go ahead,

33:26.100 --> 33:29.000
It's your first day,
You earned it,

33:29.100 --> 33:30.900
Okay, Up-up-up!

33:31.000 --> 33:32.300
Good,

33:32.400 --> 33:33.300
Straight legs,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.000
Nice and steady,

33:36.100 --> 33:37.000
Big smile!

33:38.000 --> 33:39.300
I did it!

33:39.400 --> 33:41.000
Kodiaks, attack...!

33:43.900 --> 33:45.400
Sorry,

33:45.600 --> 33:48.700
Well, if you can crush John
like you crushed Molly...

33:48.800 --> 33:51.300
I think we got it,

33:51.400 --> 33:52.800
Don't be sorry, Be strong,

33:52.900 --> 33:55.100
The most important thing
a cheerleader wears...

33:55.200 --> 33:57.000
is her attitude,

33:57.100 --> 33:59.400
Watch this,

33:59.500 --> 34:02.000
BOY:
That is hot!

34:02.200 --> 34:03.400
I can do that,

34:03.600 --> 34:05.500
Hey, how you doin'?

34:08.300 --> 34:10.400
Heather...we're cool, right?

34:10.500 --> 34:11.400
What?

34:11.500 --> 34:13.600
Who's the new cheerleader?

34:13.699 --> 34:15.100
Ow,

34:15.300 --> 34:16.500
That's Kate,

34:16.699 --> 34:18.000
She's cute,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.100
Not gonna happen,

34:21.199 --> 34:22.800
She's not into
high school boys,

34:30.199 --> 34:32.000
That's it?

34:32.100 --> 34:33.400
We just planted the seed,

34:33.500 --> 34:35.800
What'd he say about me?
Did he say anything?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.199
He said that?
He really di...?

34:38.300 --> 34:39.600
Uh, oh, my gosh,
I-I mean...

34:39.699 --> 34:41.100
you didn't even introduce me,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.100
Should I go talk to him?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I-I'll go... No?

34:45.100 --> 34:46.199
What?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.400
Okay, emergency meeting,

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
I think we're sending Kate in
before she's ready,

34:55.600 --> 34:57.600
I... I'm totally ready,

34:57.800 --> 35:01.000
Really? Tell 'em
whatJohn said about you,

35:01.100 --> 35:02.700
Oh, what, about me being cute?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.900
Oh, No, it's
just a comment,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
If anything, it's an insult,

35:06.200 --> 35:08.000
I know he's just getting
ready to use me,

35:08.100 --> 35:10.100
Kate, I'm confused,
but I thought you said...

35:10.200 --> 35:12.000
you had experience
with guys like this,

35:12.100 --> 35:15.200
I do, I-I've watched my mom date
a million and one of these guys,

35:15.400 --> 35:17.000
But have you ever dated one?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Have you ever dated
a John Tucker?

35:19.100 --> 35:21.900
Have you ever dated... anyone?

35:22.100 --> 35:24.900
- Define ''anyone,''

35:25.000 --> 35:27.300
Oh, my God! I'm totally not ready!
I'm gonna blow this...

35:27.400 --> 35:28.700
No, no, no, no,
You're gonna be fine,

35:28.800 --> 35:29.900
All right, stop, Stop,

35:30.000 --> 35:31.700
Okay, look,
you'll be fine, okay?

35:31.800 --> 35:35.700
You just gotta remember
to be cool and... collected,

35:35.800 --> 35:38.000
Yeah, Be caring and passionate,

35:38.200 --> 35:40.800
Be proud and... aggressive,

35:40.900 --> 35:42.000
You've got to make him
chase you, okay?

35:42.200 --> 35:43.200
If it's easy...

35:43.300 --> 35:44.700
he'll move on,

35:44.800 --> 35:46.100
Do you understand?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.100
Mm-hmm,
Yes, I-I have it,

35:48.200 --> 35:50.000
It's totally under control,

35:50.100 --> 35:52.200
Okay,

35:52.400 --> 35:55.800
So...he really said
you were cute?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.200
Yeah, I mean, that's what
Heather said, and... Damn it!

35:58.400 --> 35:59.600
Okay, okay, look,

35:59.700 --> 36:01.300
It's not that hard, Um...

36:01.400 --> 36:03.100
When he speaks to you...

36:03.000 --> 36:04.300
count to three...

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
in your head
before you answer him,

36:06.500 --> 36:08.800
Don't show any interest,
Don't even look at him too much,

36:09.000 --> 36:09.900
- Hm,
- Yeah, no,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.400
You got it?

36:12.500 --> 36:13.900
I said do you have it?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.500
I was counting to three,

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Not that slowly,

36:16.700 --> 36:18.600
We don't want him to think
you're retarded,

36:18.700 --> 36:21.000
Um... sorry,

36:21.100 --> 36:22.200
It's my bad,

36:22.400 --> 36:24.300
Bye,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.900
Hey,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.200
John Tucker?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.100
Hi,

36:37.200 --> 36:40.000
So... you must be new,

36:41.800 --> 36:44.700
Well, not ''new'' new, but...

36:44.800 --> 36:46.900
new to cheer,

36:49.900 --> 36:52.500
Okay, don't tell me,

36:52.600 --> 36:55.200
Tell me Friday night...
at dinner,

36:55.300 --> 36:58.900
I'm captain of the team,
You're our new cheerleader,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.800
I'm obligated to buy you dinner,
School rules,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.300
Thank you, but I'm
gonna have to pass,

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
You busy, or...?

37:07.600 --> 37:10.300
Sure, I'm busy,
Nice to meet you, Bye,

37:10.400 --> 37:13.100
What?

37:22.100 --> 37:23.800
Uh... you know,
there's actually...

37:23.900 --> 37:26.300
a pretty decent music scene
around here,

37:26.400 --> 37:29.200
You know,
if I ever know...

37:29.300 --> 37:32.000
you know, I mean, if I...
ever hear of a good show...

37:32.200 --> 37:34.700
I could maybe...
you know, I could...

37:34.800 --> 37:36.700
I could let you know...

37:36.900 --> 37:38.800
about that show,

37:38.900 --> 37:40.900
Where are you supposed to be?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.200
You don't belong in this class,

37:42.300 --> 37:45.300
I-I'm just supposed
to drop these off,

37:48.100 --> 37:49.100
Thanks,

37:49.200 --> 37:52.000
Uh, excuse me? Who are you?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.500
Whoa, Hey,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.000
What's going on h...
What is your name, son?

37:57.100 --> 37:59.100
Attention, fellow students,

37:59.200 --> 38:01.600
If Kate is out there in
Loudspeaker Land, my number is...

38:01.700 --> 38:05.100
555-6467,

38:05.200 --> 38:07.200
Give me a pen,

38:07.300 --> 38:08.800
I'm the captain of the team,

38:08.900 --> 38:10.100
You're our new cheerleader,

38:10.300 --> 38:12.600
I'm obligated to buy you dinner,
School rules,

38:12.700 --> 38:15.100
Thank you, but I'm gonna have to pass,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Uh, how'd you guys get this video?

38:17.100 --> 38:19.000
I've been documenting our efforts,

38:19.100 --> 38:20.500
Great! Make a video,

38:20.600 --> 38:23.000
MaybeJohn'll get
a role on The O,C,

38:23.100 --> 38:24.400
It's our expose,

38:24.600 --> 38:27.000
We're gonna show everybody
the realJohn Tucker,

38:27.100 --> 38:29.600
And how we broke his... heart,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.200
It'll be like...

38:31.300 --> 38:32.400
Prime Time Tucker,

38:32.500 --> 38:34.000
Hasta la vista, motherf...

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
Stop...

38:35.200 --> 38:36.200
with the rhyming,

38:36.300 --> 38:37.400
Now, that's good,

38:37.600 --> 38:38.900
Do it like this,

38:39.000 --> 38:40.600
-John...
-Hey, sweetie,

38:40.700 --> 38:42.800
there's only one guy
out there for me...

38:43.000 --> 38:44.100
I just don't think
that girl is you,

38:44.200 --> 38:46.100
- ...and you are not...
- Not him!

38:46.200 --> 38:47.400
We good?

38:47.600 --> 38:48.900
We are so gonna neuter him!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.800
- Kate, do one,
- Uh...

38:50.900 --> 38:55.100
John, there's only one guy
out there for me,

38:55.200 --> 38:57.800
- You are not him,
- No, don't hold back,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.500
How do you want to
be a cheerleader...

38:59.600 --> 39:00.900
with no attitude?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.700
I... don't want to be
a cheerleader,

39:02.800 --> 39:03.800
Kate...

39:03.900 --> 39:05.100
everyone wants to be
a cheerleader,

39:05.200 --> 39:07.000
Come on, you got to sell it!

39:08.100 --> 39:09.200
John...

39:09.400 --> 39:12.200
there's only one guy
out there for me...

39:12.300 --> 39:15.100
- but you are not him,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.100
No,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.700
Kate, this is for
every guy out there...

39:18.900 --> 39:20.800
that's ever lied to any girl,

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Okay?

39:22.100 --> 39:24.400
Okay, action,

39:26.200 --> 39:30.400
John Tucker, there's only
one guy out there for me...

39:30.500 --> 39:33.100
but you are not him,

39:35.300 --> 39:37.900
Damn,
You are gonna be a legend,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.800
Yeah,

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
Oh, hey,

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Hey,

39:54.800 --> 39:56.300
Did you like the flowers?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.500
Uh, yeah, if you're...
into that sort of thing,

39:59.600 --> 40:02.200
'Cause... I didn't
get a phone call,

40:02.300 --> 40:04.700
I didn't have a pen,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.200
- Scrappy!
- Oh!

40:17.200 --> 40:18.900
- Hey, man,
- Hey,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.900
So, you're lab partners
with Kate, right?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.400
You talk,
What's her deal?

40:26.100 --> 40:27.600
Yeah, I don't know, man,

40:27.800 --> 40:29.600
I don't think
she's your type, though,

40:29.700 --> 40:31.600
''Girl'' is my type,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.200
- All right, well...

40:33.300 --> 40:36.000
then-then maybe, uh,
you're not her type,

40:36.100 --> 40:37.600
She's into stuff like...

40:37.700 --> 40:39.400
old-school Elvis Costello;
she listens...

40:39.600 --> 40:41.000
to obscure podcasts;

40:41.100 --> 40:42.900
she reads Dave Eggers,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.400
You know, she's...
she's deep, man,

40:45.500 --> 40:47.100
Dude... I'm deep,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.600
I'm dating the Poetry Club,

40:49.700 --> 40:52.000
Oh,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.200
So,John asked you to spy on me?

40:54.300 --> 40:56.000
Yeah, he heard we
were lab partners...

40:56.000 --> 40:58.200
so he's having me tail you
and find out what I can,

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
Although, I am supposed
to be playing it cool...

41:00.600 --> 41:02.500
and not giving anything away,

41:02.600 --> 41:05.000
You're, like,
the worst spy in the world,

41:05.200 --> 41:06.500
Or am I the best
spy in the world?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Who's waiting by the phone,
and who's chatting up the girl?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.100
- That's true,
- Eh?

41:11.100 --> 41:13.100
I have a kink,
I have a kink in my neck,

41:13.200 --> 41:16.000
That's probably those
new cheer muscles of yours,

41:16.100 --> 41:18.400
Are you making fun of me?

41:18.500 --> 41:20.800
Uh, a little bit, yeah,

41:25.100 --> 41:26.800
Um... sorry,

41:26.900 --> 41:29.000
- Yeah, uh...
- All right,

41:29.100 --> 41:30.400
- These are your books,
- Yeah,

41:30.600 --> 41:31.400
I'm gonna go,

41:31.500 --> 41:32.600
''Go, Fight, Roar,''

41:32.800 --> 41:33.600
Yeah, Right, Yeah,

41:33.800 --> 41:34.900
Bye,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.700
Shit,

41:36.800 --> 41:39.500
Here we go, Kodiaks, Here we go!

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
Yeah, baby!

41:42.600 --> 41:43.500
Defense!

41:43.600 --> 41:45.500
Hey, I think I totally
blew it with John,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.200
I mean, he hasn't even looked
at me since I turned him down,

41:48.300 --> 41:49.700
Relax, Kate, this is going
to work, I promise,

41:49.800 --> 41:50.900
H-How do you know?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.100
I just know, I promise,

41:52.200 --> 41:53.900
Kate Spencer,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.300
How you doing?

41:55.400 --> 41:57.100
Good, How are you?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.500
Not so good,

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
See, I like this girl,
but she doesn't know I exist,

42:00.700 --> 42:02.400
Tucker! Get in the game!

42:02.600 --> 42:03.900
I'm baring my soul, here, Coach,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.200
John, I understand and respect
your emotional needs...

42:09.100 --> 42:10.800
Ball!

42:11.000 --> 42:12.400
So, Fridays...

42:12.600 --> 42:14.400
we usually go out to the beach,
watch the sunset,

42:14.600 --> 42:16.200
You should come,

42:16.300 --> 42:17.000
U-Uh...

42:17.100 --> 42:18.700
Come on,J,T,!

42:18.800 --> 42:19.600
-John...
- Tucker, shoot!

42:19.800 --> 42:21.200
KATE:
If it'll make him shoot, okay,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.100
You,

42:29.400 --> 42:30.200
Yeah!

42:32.100 --> 42:35.000
Kodiaks are number one!

42:35.100 --> 42:36.500
After Thursday's game,
it's no question...

42:36.700 --> 42:38.000
which Kate S, has taken
the school by storm...

42:38.200 --> 42:39.900
capturing the full attention...

42:40.000 --> 42:41.500
of the school's greatest prize...

42:41.600 --> 42:43.100
-J,T,!

42:43.000 --> 42:45.500
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

42:45.600 --> 42:49.000
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

42:51.300 --> 42:52.600
Sorry,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.900
I've never done this before,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
You put it on her bra?

42:56.100 --> 42:57.100
Guys, he is gonna find that...

42:57.200 --> 42:58.700
in, like,
the first five minutes,

42:59.800 --> 43:02.000
Or not,

43:02.100 --> 43:04.400
Beth, can you speak
into the cleavage?

43:04.500 --> 43:06.800
Um... Kate's boob cam,

43:07.000 --> 43:08.500
Testing, testing, Hello,

43:08.600 --> 43:10.500
You guys,

43:10.700 --> 43:11.500
Oh, my gosh!

43:11.600 --> 43:12.700
- Hello!
- Oh, my gosh!

43:12.800 --> 43:15.600
-Waah... waah...
-Okay,

43:15.800 --> 43:16.800
Okay,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.100
You know, if we play
our cards right...

43:19.200 --> 43:22.200
we can keep this going all
the way tillJohn's birthday,

43:22.300 --> 43:24.200
That may just work, See?

43:24.300 --> 43:26.400
I've already made a projected
Heartbreak Timeline...

43:26.600 --> 43:28.200
based on John's
average conquests...

43:28.400 --> 43:29.600
compared to Kate's
rising Cool Factor,

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
Hmm!

43:30.900 --> 43:32.000
So, it leads to two events:

43:32.200 --> 43:34.000
the away game
and John's birthday party,

43:34.100 --> 43:37.200
Now, I say our best chance
at heartbreak...

43:37.300 --> 43:38.600
is to see how much
he cares about Kate,

43:38.700 --> 43:40.000
So we test him...

43:40.000 --> 43:41.400
at the away game, and then...

43:41.500 --> 43:43.400
we crush him...

43:43.500 --> 43:44.500
...at his party,

43:44.600 --> 43:45.800
Bingo,

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
How do you know he's going
to have a party?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.200
Oh, you're so new,
it's cute, Okay,

43:50.300 --> 43:53.800
John's birthday is, like,
homecoming combined with prom...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.800
combined with MTV Music Awards,

43:56.900 --> 43:58.300
So are you ready for him?

43:58.400 --> 44:00.000
Yes, Okay, so, um,
I play hard to get,

44:00.100 --> 44:02.500
I-I count to three,
I've got it,

44:02.600 --> 44:04.000
No,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.500
That's when you were
playing hard to get,

44:06.600 --> 44:08.000
You're going out,
He's got you,

44:08.200 --> 44:11.400
So I count... to four?

44:11.600 --> 44:14.200
Oh, my God, I don't know
what I'm doing!

44:14.300 --> 44:16.000
I mean, this is
a really bad idea, you guys!

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Chill out!

44:17.200 --> 44:18.500
Look, you're with three girls...

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
who know how he
operates, okay?

44:19.800 --> 44:20.900
You'll be fine,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Okay, I'm going to beJohn,

44:22.200 --> 44:23.400
Heather, be Kate,

44:23.500 --> 44:24.700
I don't want to be Kate,
You be Kate,

44:24.800 --> 44:25.700
Can I be Kate?

44:25.800 --> 44:27.100
Fine, let Kate be Kate,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.700
-Just go,
- Okay,

44:28.800 --> 44:32.200
Baby, it's your lucky day...

44:32.300 --> 44:33.600
'cause I'm going
to take you out tonight,

44:33.700 --> 44:35.100
Where do you want to go?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.300
I don't know,

44:36.400 --> 44:37.800
Where do you want to go?

44:38.000 --> 44:40.100
No! He's not in control, remember?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.400
You are, Right?

44:41.600 --> 44:43.300
- Mm-hmm,
- Now, try it with me,

44:43.400 --> 44:46.000
Honey, you know I'm all about
what makes you happy,

44:46.200 --> 44:48.500
So, what movie?

44:48.600 --> 44:50.200
Anything you want,

44:52.300 --> 44:54.600
What do you think I want?

44:54.700 --> 44:56.700
And don't be wrong,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.700
- Ka-pow,
- Nice,

45:03.700 --> 45:04.900
- Okay,
- These,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.800
Okay, wait, it can't
hide the camera,

45:06.900 --> 45:08.900
Cleavage, It's going
to go in the sweater,

45:09.000 --> 45:10.700
It'll be perfect,
We'll hide it right under this...

45:20.100 --> 45:21.100
Kate, Hey, you made it,

45:21.200 --> 45:22.800
Yeah,

45:22.900 --> 45:23.900
Hey, Kate,
How's it going?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Hi, Tuck, Kate,

45:25.000 --> 45:26.700
- Hey, Kate,
- Looking good, Kate,

45:26.900 --> 45:29.000
Hey, Kate! It's Becky
from Student Council,

45:29.100 --> 45:30.100
Oh, hey!

45:30.300 --> 45:31.500
Hey, what's up, Kate?

45:31.600 --> 45:34.600
Looks like I'm out with
the most popular girl in school,

45:34.700 --> 45:36.600
Lucky you,

45:36.700 --> 45:39.400
So... tell me about yourself,

45:39.500 --> 45:41.900
I want to know everything;
your whole story,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.200
Oh, my story,

45:43.300 --> 45:45.400
Um... It's still being written,

45:45.600 --> 45:47.000
So... it's a mystery,

45:47.200 --> 45:48.300
Mm-hmm,

45:48.400 --> 45:49.600
I like mysteries,

45:49.700 --> 45:51.000
Really?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.700
I mean, what do you
like about them?

45:53.800 --> 45:55.300
I don't know,

45:55.400 --> 45:57.100
I guess...

45:57.200 --> 45:59.400
I like secrets,

45:59.500 --> 46:02.100
I bet,

46:05.400 --> 46:07.800
Okay, You're right,

46:07.900 --> 46:09.400
Too much talking
ruins the moment,

46:09.500 --> 46:13.200
Let me just stand here
and enjoy this,

46:13.300 --> 46:14.400
John,

46:14.500 --> 46:15.600
Shh...

46:15.700 --> 46:18.000
The sunset is that way,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Yeah, no, I'm just enjoying...

46:20.100 --> 46:21.900
everyone staring at me
in insane jealousy,

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
They wish they were out
with a girl like you,

46:27.100 --> 46:29.400
So, how did I end
up out tonight...

46:29.600 --> 46:31.600
with the most amazing
girl in school?

46:31.700 --> 46:33.300
I mean, was it
my irresistible charm...

46:33.400 --> 46:36.400
or... my really nice butt?

46:36.600 --> 46:38.800
I think it was
your incredible modesty,

46:38.900 --> 46:40.100
- Liar!
- Oh, shit!

46:40.000 --> 46:41.100
He's in his zone tonight,

46:41.200 --> 46:43.100
I hope she can handle it,

46:43.000 --> 46:44.800
The beach, the sunset...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
At least there's no romantic fire,

46:47.100 --> 46:48.200
Ah!

46:48.400 --> 46:50.000
Mine's on fire!

46:50.100 --> 46:51.200
Thank you,

46:54.100 --> 46:56.600
Ew,

46:56.700 --> 46:59.000
So, um...

46:59.200 --> 47:01.100
can I give you a ride home?

47:01.200 --> 47:03.200
Now?

47:03.400 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, Yeah,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.100
Um...

47:09.000 --> 47:11.100
I have to pee,

47:12.600 --> 47:14.500
That was too much information,

47:14.600 --> 47:15.900
It's okay,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.600
Your secret's safe with me,

47:17.700 --> 47:18.900
I-I gotta make sure...

47:19.000 --> 47:20.800
Tommy's got a ride home,
anyway, so, uh...

47:21.000 --> 47:23.600
I'll meet you at the truck?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.100
Yeah, Yeah,

47:33.800 --> 47:35.000
Hello,

47:35.100 --> 47:36.700
I need some help here,

47:36.800 --> 47:38.300
We didn't prepare her for this,

47:41.400 --> 47:43.300
- Hi,
- Hey,

47:43.400 --> 47:44.600
Okay, a ride home?
Wh-what do I do?

47:44.700 --> 47:45.700
Just breathe,

47:45.800 --> 47:48.100
This is really good,
It means he's into you,

47:48.000 --> 47:49.100
Do you think
he's going to make a move?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.700
No, if anything,
it's just going to be a kiss,

47:50.800 --> 47:52.900
He keeps it PG-1 3
on the first night,

47:53.000 --> 47:53.400
Okay, Are you a good kisser?

47:53.400 --> 47:55.000
Okay, Are you a good kisser?

47:55.000 --> 47:57.500
I-I-I don't know,
How does anybody know?

47:57.600 --> 47:59.400
Do guys tell you
you're a good kisser?

48:00.400 --> 48:03.200
Oh, my God, I-I'm a bad kisser,

48:03.400 --> 48:04.700
Okay, stop,

48:04.800 --> 48:06.200
All we need is one kiss...

48:06.300 --> 48:08.000
and then you leave
him wanting more,

48:08.100 --> 48:09.400
It is not that hard, okay?

48:09.600 --> 48:10.900
Oh, my God,

48:11.100 --> 48:12.600
I'm going to have to
show you, aren't I?

48:12.800 --> 48:14.700
- Okay, Um...
- Right now?

48:14.800 --> 48:16.100
Okay, Quick, Okay,

48:16.200 --> 48:17.600
Come here,

48:17.700 --> 48:18.500
You lock in on him...

48:18.600 --> 48:20.000
grab onto that
gorgeous head of hair...

48:20.200 --> 48:22.400
and take control,

48:22.500 --> 48:24.800
Hold his gaze,

48:24.900 --> 48:27.500
Your lips might just touch,
but not yet,

48:27.600 --> 48:31.100
It's just gotta be the temptation,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.200
And then you give him
one light kiss,

48:37.100 --> 48:39.100
BOY:
Holy jama lama,

48:39.200 --> 48:40.400
Kiss her again,

48:40.500 --> 48:41.700
Do it,

48:41.800 --> 48:42.800
Get out of here, you little perv!

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
- Shit!

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Kate, I'm gone,

48:47.800 --> 48:48.700
Kate,

48:48.900 --> 48:49.800
Can you kill the lights?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Uh...

48:52.100 --> 48:53.400
- Hey,
- Hey,

48:53.500 --> 48:55.600
- Hey,
- Hi,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.700
- What's wrong?

48:58.800 --> 49:00.500
Nothing, Nothing,

49:00.600 --> 49:02.300
I-I... I was just breathing,

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
I...

49:03.500 --> 49:04.800
I breathe a lot,

49:04.900 --> 49:06.100
Right,

49:11.200 --> 49:12.200
Beth's still in the truck,

49:12.300 --> 49:14.100
What?!

49:14.000 --> 49:15.200
Slut in truck!

49:15.300 --> 49:16.300
Come on, We gotta move,

49:16.400 --> 49:17.600
Oh, my God,

49:17.800 --> 49:20.100
- Okay, okay, here we go,

49:23.900 --> 49:25.000
JOHN:
So...

49:25.100 --> 49:27.500
what kind of music you into?

49:27.600 --> 49:30.300
Good music,

49:30.400 --> 49:32.500
Think I might have some of that,

49:32.600 --> 49:34.500
Let's see,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Here we go,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
You like Elvis Costello?

49:49.200 --> 49:51.000
You tell me you don't...

49:51.000 --> 49:53.400
I'm kicking you out
of the car right now,

49:53.600 --> 49:55.800
No, I-I-I love him,

49:55.900 --> 49:58.800
I mean... he's okay,

49:58.900 --> 50:01.100
I guess, Whatever,

50:16.200 --> 50:19.000
So what are some of
your other secrets?

50:19.000 --> 50:20.800
Uh...

50:20.900 --> 50:26.500
Well, if I told you,
I-I'd have to kill you,

50:43.100 --> 50:45.200
I'm glad we did this,

50:45.300 --> 50:46.600
I had a great time,

50:46.800 --> 50:48.900
Me, too,

50:50.000 --> 50:51.100
Um...

50:51.000 --> 50:53.100
Walk me to my door,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Sure,

51:05.500 --> 51:09.000
Kate?

51:09.100 --> 51:11.600
I could walk you to your door...

51:11.700 --> 51:12.600
but...

51:12.700 --> 51:15.100
then I'd be too tempted to kiss you,

51:15.200 --> 51:18.800
And I really like you,

51:18.900 --> 51:20.100
You know? And I...

51:20.200 --> 51:21.900
I-I don't want to risk anything
by moving too fast,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.100
So...

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
rather than torture myself...

51:26.100 --> 51:28.700
I'm just going to say good night,

51:28.800 --> 51:30.900
So... good night,

51:33.000 --> 51:34.900
- Ow!
- Ow,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.800
Ow,

51:36.900 --> 51:39.400
I-I think I bobbed
when you weaved,

51:39.500 --> 51:41.600
- Yeah,

51:41.700 --> 51:43.000
She's going off-book,

51:43.100 --> 51:44.100
What just happened?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Is that Beth?

51:46.100 --> 51:47.200
What?

51:47.400 --> 51:48.400
Okay,

51:50.900 --> 51:52.000
Bye,

51:53.200 --> 51:56.600
I always like a little risk,

52:07.600 --> 52:09.200
- Oh, my gosh,
- Come on,

52:10.900 --> 52:12.000
HEATHER:
Uh-oh,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.100
Something is not right,

52:31.400 --> 52:32.900
Wh... whoa,

52:34.200 --> 52:36.000
- Kate?
- U-Um...

52:36.100 --> 52:38.200
I don't want to risk
anything by going too fast,

52:42.500 --> 52:44.700
Ah, Ah,

52:52.700 --> 52:54.100
It's not even my date...

52:54.000 --> 52:56.300
and he still gets me
out of my skirt,

53:12.200 --> 53:13.400
Whoa,

53:13.500 --> 53:14.700
Honey, what happened?

53:14.900 --> 53:16.800
The sprinklers, Sorry,

53:17.000 --> 53:20.100
Oh! That could ruin a date, huh?

53:20.200 --> 53:22.300
It wasn't a real date, Mom,

53:22.400 --> 53:23.800
Right,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.200
Um...

53:26.300 --> 53:28.200
Listen, uh...

53:28.300 --> 53:30.900
I don't think
this is such a good idea,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
You know,
pretending to like a guy,

53:33.100 --> 53:35.100
I just... I don't want
to see you get hurt,

53:35.200 --> 53:36.400
I'm not going to get hurt,

53:36.500 --> 53:38.400
He is,

53:38.600 --> 53:41.100
My advice...

53:41.000 --> 53:43.700
is not to do this,

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
Mom, there's a lot of things
I come to you for advice about...

53:46.000 --> 53:48.100
but this is not one of them,

53:48.000 --> 53:49.700
I'm sorry, but...

53:49.900 --> 53:51.600
honestly, how manyJohn Tuckers...

53:51.800 --> 53:53.200
have pulled a hit-and-run on you?

53:53.300 --> 53:54.700
That's not fair,

53:54.800 --> 53:57.200
I have met some pretty
nice guys lately,

53:57.300 --> 53:58.600
Right, yeah,

53:58.700 --> 54:00.000
The drummer, the guy in rehab...

54:00.200 --> 54:01.800
and, throw in that one
from the tanning salon...

54:01.900 --> 54:03.500
and you've hit the trifecta,

54:05.100 --> 54:07.100
When did you get like this?

54:07.200 --> 54:09.400
A month ago,
you wouldn't like you right now,

54:09.500 --> 54:12.000
A month ago, nobody liked me,

54:12.100 --> 54:13.000
I did,

54:15.300 --> 54:17.200
I'm sorry, I just...

54:17.400 --> 54:20.000
It's been a long night,
I'm a little... you know...

54:20.100 --> 54:21.100
Yeah, it's okay,

54:21.200 --> 54:24.500
I got a little of that, too,

54:25.600 --> 54:28.100
Good night,

54:28.200 --> 54:30.000
Kate?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.800
Just be careful
who you pretend to be,

54:32.900 --> 54:36.200
I mean, I'd hate
if you forgot who you are,

54:36.300 --> 54:41.900
I was nobody, so there's really
no risk in losing anything,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.100
So, how long till you think
he's back again?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.600
I say he'll show up in
the next... 30 seconds?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.400
Come on,

54:57.100 --> 54:58.500
Ah, like clockwork,

54:58.600 --> 55:00.000
- That's call number five,

55:00.100 --> 55:02.000
That's two calls past desperate,

55:02.100 --> 55:04.300
- Get it,

55:04.400 --> 55:06.000
Hello,

55:06.200 --> 55:08.900
Hey, Kate, It's me,

55:10.200 --> 55:12.400
-John?

55:12.600 --> 55:13.800
John Tucker?

55:13.900 --> 55:16.600
Oh, yeah, Hey,
Um, I just got in, What's up?

55:16.800 --> 55:19.000
So, did you figure out...

55:19.100 --> 55:20.800
if you were doing anything on Saturday?

55:20.900 --> 55:23.000
Um... yeah,

55:23.200 --> 55:25.700
I did, and...

55:25.800 --> 55:26.800
Oh, crap,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.100
What's the matter?

55:28.200 --> 55:29.800
Uh, some perv's been
checking out the house...

55:30.000 --> 55:31.700
and I think I see him,

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
I think he's in a Jeep or something,

55:33.900 --> 55:34.900
Really?

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
You want me to cruise by
and check it out?

55:38.200 --> 55:40.100
No, We're just
gonna call the cops,

55:40.000 --> 55:41.500
JOHN:
O-Okay,

55:41.600 --> 55:43.900
Well, I'll-I'll talk to you later then,

55:44.000 --> 55:45.500
Shit,

55:53.200 --> 55:56.900
We figured if we'd hit stalking potential...

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
it was time to letJohn
take me out on a real date,

56:00.100 --> 56:03.000
What?
We're not eating here?

56:03.100 --> 56:05.500
Nah, I thought
we'd do take-out,

56:10.200 --> 56:12.000
Wait, where are we going?

56:12.100 --> 56:14.500
Well, I could tell you...

56:14.600 --> 56:16.800
but then I'd have to kill you,

56:16.900 --> 56:19.900
- Come on,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.100
There's our table,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
Oh, my gosh,

56:25.100 --> 56:26.900
Where are they?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.200
Where'd they go?

56:28.300 --> 56:29.600
Wait,

56:31.100 --> 56:33.200
You guys...

56:33.400 --> 56:35.000
I can't tell where they are,

56:40.800 --> 56:42.300
Okay, it's...... it's definitely dark,

56:42.400 --> 56:43.500
What?

56:43.600 --> 56:44.800
I don't know,
Outside, maybe?

56:44.900 --> 56:48.500
No effin' way!

56:48.600 --> 56:51.500
Boat? Has anybody else
been on the boat?

56:51.600 --> 56:53.500
I've never been on the boat,

56:53.600 --> 56:57.100
Nobody even told me he had a boat!

56:57.200 --> 56:58.700
She's not equipped
to handle this,

56:58.800 --> 57:00.100
- Huh,

57:00.000 --> 57:01.300
I'm losing them,

57:02.800 --> 57:04.100
I'm losing them! Hey!

57:04.200 --> 57:05.900
Oh,John,

57:06.000 --> 57:07.400
I'm serious,
-Stop it,

57:07.600 --> 57:08.800
We've gotta get out there,

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Come on!

57:12.100 --> 57:13.700
We've gotta get there now-ish,

57:13.800 --> 57:15.500
I can't! This motor sucks,

57:15.600 --> 57:18.600
- Can't you go a little faster?
- No,

57:18.700 --> 57:20.700
Give me an oar,
I could paddle faster than you!

57:20.800 --> 57:23.000
Just pretend
it's a whaling ship and...

57:23.000 --> 57:24.700
go Greenpeace on their asses!

57:24.800 --> 57:26.000
BETH:
What?

57:26.100 --> 57:27.100
- Hey! Hey!

57:28.600 --> 57:31.600
Nice, Gilligan here
just flooded the engine,

57:31.800 --> 57:33.000
I'll give you ''Gilligan,''

57:33.100 --> 57:35.600
- Heather, Heather, stop it!
- Stop! Stop it! That's wet!

57:35.700 --> 57:37.500
You have no idea
what you're doing, Heather!

57:37.700 --> 57:39.000
Wait,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Okay, This is fine,

57:46.100 --> 57:48.100
This is why God
invented Triple-A,

57:49.400 --> 57:51.000
Oh, no,

57:51.100 --> 57:52.300
What?

57:52.400 --> 57:53.700
No signal,

57:53.800 --> 57:56.400
What?

57:56.500 --> 57:58.800
No signal?

58:06.600 --> 58:10.500
It was the first time
I was truly alone with John,

58:10.600 --> 58:12.200
I can't quite explain it, but...

58:12.300 --> 58:14.900
Okay, if I could dream
ofhow a date should be...

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Now make a wish,

58:16.100 --> 58:18.400
KATE:
,,John Tucker did it better,

58:18.500 --> 58:19.400
He did it way better,

58:19.600 --> 58:21.000
I mean, when do you cue
the dolphins?

58:21.100 --> 58:22.300
Right,

58:22.400 --> 58:24.100
I mean, no-no-no-no,
don't get me wrong,

58:24.200 --> 58:26.700
It's... It's really nice, but...

58:26.800 --> 58:28.400
are you really that scared...

58:28.600 --> 58:30.800
to just hang out
and be yourself?

58:34.000 --> 58:36.500
Okay, Fair enough,

58:36.600 --> 58:40.500
But it is terrifying,
trying to impress you,

58:40.600 --> 58:42.100
Me?

58:42.200 --> 58:43.700
Kate, I mean...

58:43.900 --> 58:45.000
you come out of nowhere...

58:45.000 --> 58:47.900
and you've got
high school dialed in,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.800
I don't really think I'm that dialed,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.500
No, uh, you're
the varsity captain...

58:53.600 --> 58:55.500
and the most popular guy
in school, yeah?

58:55.600 --> 58:59.000
Right, right, right, yeah, um, I guess,

58:59.100 --> 59:00.400
You know, I'm-I'm just lucky,

59:00.500 --> 59:01.800
Okay...

59:02.000 --> 59:03.900
I'm really lucky,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, and-and-and
that's why I'd be crazy...

59:06.200 --> 59:07.600
not to make the most of it,

59:07.700 --> 59:11.100
Look, Kate...

59:11.200 --> 59:14.700
Maybe sometimes
I come on too strong,

59:14.800 --> 59:17.400
I don't know who else to be,

59:17.600 --> 59:21.300
You know, I just gotta put
my whole heart into things,

59:23.500 --> 59:26.800
That sounds like an easy way
to get it broken,

59:29.900 --> 59:33.000
Well... luckily, I...
figured out a way...

59:33.200 --> 59:35.700
to protect myself against that,

59:35.800 --> 59:38.100
Some kick-ass dance moves,

59:38.200 --> 59:40.100
What?

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
- Wha...? Oh, my gosh!

59:43.000 --> 59:44.100
I wasn't ready for that,

59:44.200 --> 59:45.800
I was thinking about going pro,

59:45.900 --> 59:47.800
- Oh?
- Laugh all you want,

59:47.900 --> 59:49.200
There was a scout in the stands...

59:49.300 --> 59:50.300
at last year's prom,

59:50.400 --> 59:52.900
Wow,

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.700
Oh, my gosh, spill it,

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.200
We need to know everything,
Every detail right now,

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.200
I... You- I mean, you-you guys
dated him, You know,

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.800
Not on the high seas,

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.100
What the hell happened out there?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.600
Um...nothing, you know?
It was just-We... We talked...

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.000
and it was...

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It was nice,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.100
BETH:
You just talked?

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.800
You mean, he was able to...
get intimate without being...

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.700
like... intimate?

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.000
Okay,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.800
He is telling her anything
she wants to hear,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Look, the only way to see
if he's really fallen for her...

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.500
is to see how far
Kate can push him...

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.500
at the hotel after the away game,

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.900
Right,
Yeah, I-I... I can do that,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.100
Oh, no, Oh, no,
I know that look,

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.000
He's got you under his spell,

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.800
What? No! I-I...
Come on,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:00:59.900
No, you come on,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.900
You can't lose focus
going into the finals,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.900
Kate, we all believed him...

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.700
but there is no way to know what
this guy is really thinking,

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.700
Yes, there is,

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.300
I'm reporting from behind enemy lines...

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.000
a fortress, if you will,
where the innermost workings...

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.800
of the male psyche
reveal themselves...

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.200
like a slide under a microscope,

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.100
- Good practice, Good practice!

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.300
JOHN:
Central is going down!

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.600
Get down!

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.000
That's disgusting,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.400
Hey, look, Ma! No hands!

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.100
Disgusting, Nice work,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.500
- Oh! Tommy! Nachos?
- Damn!

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.200
I think it was nachos,

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.100
Holy guacamole,

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.600
Away game, dude,
You gonna be my wingman?

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.400
Naw, I think I'm just gonna
hang out with Kate tonight,

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.600
Aw, come on,
So I gotta take care...

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.000
of all that Central High tail by myself?

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.400
- Guess so,
- Ah, come on, man!

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.500
We gonna get us some girls...

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.700
or are you gonna act like one?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.200
That's messed up, Tommy,

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.600
John, Please, please tell me...

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.100
you tapped that by now!

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.100
Boys, Boys, Look...

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.000
you don't just pop
an '82 Bordeaux...

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.600
'cause it's on your shelf,

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.100
Oh, please,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.100
Great things take time,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.700
Man, you whipped!

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.200
- Whipped, man!

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.100
Hey! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.800
Nobody is whipped, okay?
John Tucker is not whipped,

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.400
Oh, here we go,

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
Let's just say,
at tonight's away game...

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.000
I'm gonna be scoring
more than baskets,

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.800
Bingo,

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.700
Okay, okay, Uncork it,
then pork it,

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.700
- Now that's my man!
- Slam-dunk, baby,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.400
TEAMMATES

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.700
We are so gonna get him,

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.800
So, hydrogen and oxygen
are getting a drink...

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and gold walks in
and they go...

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.800
''AU! Get outta the bar!''

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.000
'Cause, you know, AU is...

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.700
the atomic symbol for gold,

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800
Yeah, Yeah,
I-I got it,

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.800
Oh, good,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You're gonna help me measure
with the doodad and everything,

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.800
Oh, I actually thought
I'd work with Alex today,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Oh, I... Well, he's
gonna take you back...

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.200
without an insurance waiver?

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.500
Yeah, well,
he's warmed up to me...

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.100
since his left eyebrow grew back,

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.900
Uh...

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.400
Hey, kiddo,
Is your mom home?

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.400
Nope,

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.700
Is that him?

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.300
You're not seriously
going out with Skip, are you?

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.600
Don't call him that,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.100
We're just going out,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.100
Mom, please don't do this,

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.100
- Please?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.100
He's probably in town
for a layover...

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.900
and he's just looking
for someone to lay over,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.400
Very clever, sweetheart,

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.200
Can we not do this
whole thing right now?

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.000
Mom, no wonder I'm so messed up,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.100
I've never actually seen
a functional relationship,

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.600
Who I date...

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.100
is none of your business,

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.600
Are you serious?

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.700
Can you imagine growing up
with a mom who only dates jerks?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.000
You don't really see
how this affects me?

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.400
See you tomorrow,

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.600
Don't forget to lock the door
when you sneak out,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.100
So,your team's just won
the semifinals...

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.000
you're at a hotel
with all your friends...

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.100
I mean, this should be fun,
shouldn't it?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.700
CARRI E:
Come on,! Get up,!

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.100
Let's go,

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.000
Now the real game begins,

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.200
Are you sure we're
not going too far?

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.800
HEATHER:
Look...

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.100
this game's in crunch time,

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.000
Kate, do you know what happens
when you let your guard down...

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.400
around John Tucker?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.600
Carrie, show her,

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.000
You need to see this,

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.600
Here,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
- Man, you whipped, man!
- Whipped!

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.000
- Hold up! Hold up,
- All right, What? What?

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.100
I am not whipped, okay?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.300
John Tucker is not whipped,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.100
I will have you know
that at tonight's away game...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.200
I'm gonna be scoring more than baskets,

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.700
TOMMY:
Uncork it, then pork it,

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.900
- Okay, I got you on that one!
- Slam-dunk, baby,

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.700
John Tucker, you are going down,

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.600
What? Is it okay?

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.100
You should totally wear
underwear to school,

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.000
- She's hot!
- Yeah, you, girl!

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.900
TOMMY:
''Kate S, requests...

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
video chat with John T''?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.000
Okay, you're gone,

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.600
- All right! Playa-playa!
- Come on, Tommy, Up,

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.600
- Bye-bye,
- Fabio, Ow,

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.600
- Hey, there,

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:18.000
Hey, You alone?

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah, You?

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.900
Yeah, It's so sad...
'cause I'm s...

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.300
I'm so... lovely,

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.500
No!

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.400
- Lonely!

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.100
I'm so lonely,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.400
JOHN:
Well, maybe I could...

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.200
come over there
and keep you company,

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.800
Oh, I'd like that...
but there's a problem,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.600
Coach Williams is out in the hall,

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.200
- She's totally watching,

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.000
There's no way
you could get in here,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.300
- Damn it,
- Unless...

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.000
you went out on the ledge...

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.000
and came in
through the sliding door?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.400
Yeah, right,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.800
Yeah, that's crazy,

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.300
It's too bad,
I got all... dressed up,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.600
Or... down,

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.300
I-I could try the balcony,

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.500
Great!
I'm three rooms down,

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.800
I already counted,

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.100
I'll be right there,

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200
Hold-Hold on!

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.500
Uh, hold on,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.800
What?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.900
Um...

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.000
I... got you a present?

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.700
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.000
It's... under your bed,

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.500
Ooh, A little preview?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.500
KATE:
N-No,

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.400
I want you to wear them,

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.000
What's wrong?

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.500
It's sexy, Haven't you
ever done this before?

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600
No,

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.500
That's cute,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.100
You're just so...
...inexperienced,

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.600
What?

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.000
No, I am not inexperienced,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
John...

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.200
Johnny, I thought
that you might do this...

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.600
Johnny, I thought
that you might do this...

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.400
one little thing for me,

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.700
And then... I might do a little
something for you,

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.700
And then... we might do a little
something together,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But...

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.800
You know what? I am tired...

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.200
...and it is getting
really late, so...

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.000
I'll just see you tomorrow,

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.100
- Night,
- Wait,

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.300
Wait, Um...
Give me five minutes,

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.100
Okay,

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.100
-You...!
- I'm sorry!

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.300
...little...!

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.399
- March!
- Ow!

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.399
- Ow!
- Ooh!John!

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.700
- What are you wearing?
- Dude, those are for ladies,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.100
What... the hell?

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.200
I think this belongs to you, Coach,

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.000
I found it in my bed,

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.000
Coach, make her let go,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.200
Let go,

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:38.700
''Live and let live''
is what I say, Tucker,

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:42.300
Takes all kinds to build a freeway,

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.000
But I am not equipped...

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.000
for this kind of weirdness...

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.399
this close to the playoffs!

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.400
I guess it was
four instead of three, Sorry,

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.000
Show's over, ladies,

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100
Back to your rooms,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.000
Show's over!
Back to your rooms,

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.100
- Hey,John!

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.400
Love the bow,

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.800
Your butt is my screensaver,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There he is,

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.500
Hey, Tucker!

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.800
All right, let's go!

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.800
Split up, shirts versus skins,
Come on,

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.600
All right, Ball,

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.800
Dude, you wearing
thongs again, man?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.100
Yup,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.200
It's like letting your best
friend sleep in a silk hammock,

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.100
They're breezy,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.100
They don't bind,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.300
And they give you
just enough swing,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.000
What?

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.300
All right, guys, let's go!

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.900
Un...believable,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.300
I'd hit him with my car...

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.400
if he wouldn't make a body cast
a fashion statement,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.800
Kate!

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.500
Hey, The other night didn't
quite go like I'd hoped,

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.000
Yeah, I know, Sorry,

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.100
Nah, it's okay,
Kind of spun it,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I noticed, Now everyone knows
Victoria's secret,

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.600
Tommy was thinking
we'd do it as a birthday theme,

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.600
''Not the Same Old
Thong and Dance,''

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.600
Cute,

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.200
Kate, Kate, wait,
Wait, wait,

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.300
Look...
you don't get it, Okay?

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.500
I was humiliated trying
to get your attention...

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.800
and I'm not working this hard
just so I can get some action,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.600
So I'm not just some
'82 Bordeaux...

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.100
you wanna
''uncork and pork''?

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.100
Where'd you hear that?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.200
No-No-No, look-look,
that-that's just...

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.000
locker room talk, okay?
That doesn't mean anything,

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.800
You act like a pig
so you don't sound whipped?

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.000
Yes, Exactly,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.200
Look, I'm... I'm saying
things I don't believe,

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.000
I'm doing things
I don't understand,

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.100
I mean, I put on your underwear
and I scaled a building,

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.800
I'm trying so hard,

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.800
But I'm out of plays,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.300
Kate... you're the one,

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:10.400
Look, I've... never
done this before, so...

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.700
I'm not exactly sure how it goes,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.800
It's just something personal,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.100
Okay? Something to show you...

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.300
and whoever wants to know,
that I'm whipped,

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.000
Excellent!

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.500
Yeah, I'm whipped,

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.100
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.500
Oh... my...

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.100
God,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.400
We'll crush him,

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.100
Kill time, Bam!

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.200
Happy birthday, little Tucker,

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.700
CARRI E:
Okay, so, now we...

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.000
Um... y-you guys...

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.800
I'm feeling a little weird
about this whole thing,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.500
Huh?

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.000
- Kate...

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You said if you ever dated a guy like this...

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.800
you would get even,

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:03.400
I know, um, but...

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, my God, you love him!

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.100
Oh, we are doing
a dating intervention,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.400
This is for your own good,

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.800
Reality check, Kate:

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.400
you're not really dating him,

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.500
You got Tucked over,

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.800
He didn't fall for you,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.800
He fell for what we made you,

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.000
Who were you before you met us?

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.400
No one... and then
we made you ''the one''...

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.200
and this is how you repay us?

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.700
So, the little monster you
created destroys John Tucker...

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.800
and then what?
What happens to me?

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.400
- You become a legend!
- Yeah!

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.600
- What if I don't want that?
- Well, you can't have him!

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.000
And... this watch
belongs to me!

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.900
I'm the head cheerleader,
He's the team captain,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
This watch should be mine!

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.100
What, you think because
you're the head cheerleader...

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.400
you can get whatever you want?

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.800
- Exactly!
- Hey! Girls! Stop,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Thanks, Carrie,

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.600
He deserves the best, okay?

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.100
He obviously deserves me,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.200
- What?!
- Please,

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.800
You don't care about him,

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.600
All you care about is
getting into Hartford,

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.100
I believe it's ''Har-vard,''

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.800
Stop it, You guys,
we're supposed to be friends,

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.400
Well, friends don't say they're
gonna do something and then...

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.000
And then totally screw
everybody over!

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.600
If you're not againstJohn,
you are not with us,

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.700
You guys really think
this is gonna help you...

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.000
get overJohn Tucker?

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.500
You're either obsessed
with destroying him...

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.100
or obsessed with dating him,

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.400
Either way,
it's always all about him,

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.000
I'm done with it,

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.000
Well, cheerleaders don't quit,

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.100
I'm not a real cheerleader,

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.400
Whatever your plan is,
count me out,

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.200
Well, don't worry about it...

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.700
because you're fired!

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.000
But...

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.500
Okay,

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.200
Hang on,

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.000
I think I know what we need,

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.500
I wish it couldjust be simple,
like a retro pop song,

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.500
Boom, end of story,
we all live happily ever after,

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600
That's a nice watch,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.300
No, it's-it's not
what it looks like,

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.300
But it's never really
like that, is it?

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.100
Since when are Beth and Carrie
friends with Heather?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.700
Those girls absolutely
hate each other, Kate,

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.300
And what are they
doing talking to you?

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.500
What happened to you?

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.800
You were so different,
and now you're like...

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.200
the rest of them-
you fell for my brother,

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400
No, I-I didn't,

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.500
No, it's-it's not like that,
I mean...

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.400
It's something you cooked
up with those three,

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.000
It's just a joke to you, isn't it?

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.000
You want to know
whyJohn fell for you?

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:52.000
He thinks that you're the first...

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.800
honest relationship
that he's been in,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.100
Well, he's not that innocent, okay?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I mean, y-you know
how John Tucker can be,

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.500
Everybody knows how he can be,
He is John Tucker,

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.000
And still, every girl
in school lines up...

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.600
to date him,
knowing what they know,

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.400
And yeah, he lies to girls
to get them to fall for him,

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.600
I can't imagine the kind
of person who would do that,

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.000
Can you?

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.800
Mom! The frosting!

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.800
There's cake under it,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.300
Yeah, I sent Skip home,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.000
Oh,

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.900
You know, I'm starting to get
this whole ''Skip'' thing,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.100
Look, I know my...

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.200
relationship stuff affects you,

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400
I made mistakes,

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.400
But I would never plan
to hurt somebody,

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.000
I-I'm just...

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.200
I just got so caught up in it,

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300
I guess...

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.000
I was invisible for so long that...

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.800
it felt good to be noticed,

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.000
Kate...

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.900
you chose to be invisible,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.900
You thought it would
be easier that way,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.400
Well, they're
noticing me now,

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.100
I mean, none of this is really me,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.900
And-and now I don't even know
who my real friends really are,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Maybe if you showed them
the real Kate, you'd find out,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
- Hey, happy birthday, bro,
- Scrappy,

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.000
Hey, have you seen Tommy?

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.000
We have a birthday
present forJohn,

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.100
Yeah, he's on stage, in the truck,

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.500
We 'bout to thump up in here!

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
People in Planes,
Yeah, that was loud right there!

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Hey, look, check me out over here,

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.700
Come on, now, gather round,

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.500
It's John Tucker toast time! Yeah!

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.900
Hey,John, come up here, man!

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.600
All right, look,
check this out,

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.200
A birthday comes
but once a year...

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.100
and the good Lord
you'll be thanking,

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.600
Now, old pal,
let's cut this cake...

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.100
and see who's giving you...

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.100
- a... spanking! Ho-ho-ho!

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.000
- Tommy! Tommy, hey!
- What's up? Whatcha got for me?

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.600
Oh,just a little something
extra from the girls at Kodiak,

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.000
Me likey,
I'm gonna start it right now,

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.400
- Okay, perfect, Here we go,

01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.800
That was hot!

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.000
- He's got mad skills!
- Now take a look at hotter!

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:04.000
Boy can slam!

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.100
Move on back
'cause Tuck's our man!

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.100
We love you,John!

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.600
Happy birthday,John!

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:14.000
- Everyone in the Poetry Club...
-Kate!

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.800
You made it, Come on,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.500
Come wish me a happy birthday,

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.000
John, that's not why I'm here,

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.800
o, Kate...

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
this is just something
to show you and...

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.800
whoever wants to know,
that I'm whipped,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
- You're the one, Kate,
-  Aw...

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.000
Look, I've never done this
before, so...

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.400
Look, I've never done this
before, so...

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.000
This is cool,

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.300
...I'm not exactly sure how it goes,

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.000
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.100
Oh, yeah!

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.700
John Tucker,
there's only one guy out there...

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800
- for me...
- Oh, no!

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.100
but you are not...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.800
What's going on?

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.000
Um...

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.800
John, I have something I have to say,

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.100
This entire time...

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.700
I've been pretending to be
a bunch of stuff that I'm not...

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.800
so you would... fall for me,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
- Louder!
- What's the deal?!

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
We were trying to break your heart...

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.800
so you knew what it felt like,

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.100
''We''?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.800
I get it,

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.900
Well, hey...

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.900
you girls pulled it off,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.400
Yeah,

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.100
It worked,

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.400
I'm sorry,

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.700
- What's the deal?!
- What's going on?!

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.700
You guys breaking up?

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.400
Look, this entire time,
I've been...

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.500
I've been lying about who I am,

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.200
But... I'm done pretending,

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.100
This is the real me,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.800
This is Kate,

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.800
- Hey, Kate!
- Yeah?

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.400
You're ruining the party!

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.300
- That is so not fair,
- Oh, no!

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.900
This is all our fault,
You do not deserve this,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.700
We should never
have done this to you,

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.600
Give me that,
Okay, Hey!

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.200
So big deal, she lied,

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.700
We all lied,

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.400
What, like you've
never lied before?

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.800
Exactly, You should be
throwing drinks at each other...

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.100
- Yeah,
- not her,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.100
Everybody chill,

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.700
Look... they're right,

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.300
All right, we all do it,

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.700
I lie,

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.200
I pretend I'm whatever
I need to to get girls,

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.500
And it works, dude!

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.000
You're the man!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.100
Naw, I'm not saying
it's a good thing,

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.800
- It's a great thing!
-Guys...

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.000
what I'm trying to say is...

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.200
it's wrong,

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.400
There ain't nothin' wrong
with hookin' up...

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.300
with the finest girls
in the school!

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.000
- Yeah!

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.300
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.400
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.700
Oh!

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.600
John!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.400
Hi,

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.200
- Hey,
- Hey,

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:40.000
Wow, you look... clean,

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.000
Thanks, You look
pretty clean yourself,

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.800
Thanks,

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.400
- Listen...

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.100
I shouldn't have
thrown the cake...

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Kate, stop,

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.900
I deserved the cake
in the face,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.300
And, as hard as it might be
for you to believe...

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.500
I'm gonna start telling the truth,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.100
I mean it,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.900
Okay, well, that...
I think that's great,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So... truce?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.100
I'd like that,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.200
Ow!

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.100
I think you bobbed when I...

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.600
- Weaved, Yeah,
- Right,

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.100
( laughs ):
Okay,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.300
See you around,

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400
Yeah, Good luck,

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.200
So, it took us
1 2 bottles of shampoo...

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.500
and three days to get
the stripper cake out of our hair,

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.900
But you know what?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
- Kate,
- It was all worth it,

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.000
Hey, Kate,

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.900
Hey, um, uh, one sec,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.200
- Hi,
- Hey,

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.700
So, uh...

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.000
things didn't quite work out
with Alex and I,

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:47.300
Um... see, we have shop
together, as well,

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.900
- Was there another fire?
- No,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.800
No, I...
I clearly warned him...

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.000
that I shouldn't be operating
a band saw,

01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.100
No way,

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.000
Um...

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.100
but Chemistry
does suck without you,

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.900
What do you say?
Lab partners?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.600
Are you sure?

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.800
Yes, I'm sure,

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.900
You're perfect, Kate,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.700
Um... you know,
'cause you're, uh...

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.900
smarter than me,
and so far, uh...

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.900
not flammable,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.500
Right?

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.000
True,

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.100
You totally have a crush...

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.900
on the other Tucker,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
She'll definitely need help
with this one,

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.900
I just upgraded my boob cam,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.100
- We can do a full-frontal attack,
- No,

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.000
No, Let's just
hang out tonight, okay?

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.400
Hang out?

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.300
Where's that gonna go on
my college application?

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:42.800
And John Tucker?

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.600
And John Tucker?

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.100
We definitely got to him,

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.900
He never lied to a girl again,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Hey, beautiful,

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.300
Now, we need to go into this
with our eyes open,

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.700
Complete honesty,

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.700
Jennifer, this is Jill...

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.000
my other girlfriend,

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.800
I think we can make this work,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.800
And the girl who made
John Tucker fall in love?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.800
Well, she's a legend,

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.100
Oh,!

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.200
I almost forgot,

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.800
If you're thinking
of trying this at home...

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.500
just remember; when you mess
with a John Tucker...

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.100
you better be prepared
for the consequences,

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.000
Holy jama lama!
