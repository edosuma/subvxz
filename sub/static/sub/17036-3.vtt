[ambulance siren]

00:13.900 --> 00:16.133
Do you want a
[inaudible],, darling?

00:22.900 --> 00:26.700
What the-- no!

00:26.800 --> 00:27.633
No!

00:27.733 --> 00:31.033
[grunting]

[music playing]

00:40.500 --> 00:43.400
[applause]

00:43.900 --> 00:44.700
Well?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.067
The hand [inaudible] good.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.733
Your hand were really
still at the end.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.000
Actually, they used a
hand double for that bit.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.200
The director said my
hand was distracting.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.467
So when are you going to stop
being cast as a slutty murder

00:58.567 --> 01:01.333
victim, do you think?

01:01.433 --> 01:03.800
Every actor starts as a
murdered prostitute, Meg.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.367
You have to build up to be
a non-murdered prostitute,

01:06.467 --> 01:09.933
and then you can play anything,
like the hot girl at work

01:10.033 --> 01:11.500
or the uptight girlfriend.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
Anything.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.367
Don't take this the
wrong way, but don't you

01:14.467 --> 01:16.400
ever feel like it's--
- What?

01:16.500 --> 01:20.333
Degrading and
sort of unfeministy?

01:20.433 --> 01:22.067
OK, Caitlin Moran,
it's just showbiz.

01:22.167 --> 01:25.733
You wouldn't understand.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.500
O-M-Jesus.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.333
Spielberg, is it?

01:28.433 --> 01:30.100
A producer's just tweeted me.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.933
He saw my portrayal of
murdered prostitute 2

01:33.033 --> 01:34.300
and he wants me
to be in his film.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.233
What?

01:35.333 --> 01:36.733
He's offered you
a job on Twitter?

01:36.833 --> 01:37.633
What is it?

01:37.733 --> 01:38.567
A movie in his pants?

01:38.667 --> 01:39.500
[chuckling]

01:39.600 --> 01:41.000
BONNIE: It's not porn.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.533
Is it?

01:42.633 --> 01:43.267
No.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.133
Look at his other credits.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.767
"Demon Cheerleader Academy,"
"Ghost Night Stand,"

01:47.867 --> 01:48.767
and now this--

01:48.867 --> 01:51.233
"Jacteria 2-- Blood Apocalypse."

01:51.333 --> 01:53.133
That is big time, Bonnie.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.567
"Jacteria 1" were [inaudible].

01:55.667 --> 01:56.500
Dracteria?

01:56.600 --> 01:57.967
It's like Dracula
and bacteria.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.267
It were huge Meg.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.667
Hmm.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.467
He wants me to play professor
Tina Van Helsing, a brilliant,

02:03.567 --> 02:05.500
but sexy biochemist.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.233
My god.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.567
That was just so me.

02:07.667 --> 02:08.933
Frequently.

02:09.033 --> 02:11.600
I always thought you were dog
shite acting, if I'm honest.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.900
Show's how much I know.

02:13.000 --> 02:13.933
Thank you.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.100
It's has to be
a prank, surely.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.500
No Meg, this is it.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.833
My big break.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.200
Don't be jealous.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.433
Your face goes are crabby
like an old-timey witch.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.000
Oh yeah.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.533
[music playing]

02:43.300 --> 02:45.533
MEG: How come you get
a sexy suit and a job

02:45.633 --> 02:47.033
with a cool headset?

02:47.133 --> 02:48.733
Can't I work there?

02:48.833 --> 02:50.167
No chance.

02:50.267 --> 02:53.333
No offense Meg, Can's take
deadwood at Leeds Telcoms.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.000
How do I look?

02:55.100 --> 02:56.167
Like you've gone blind?

02:56.267 --> 02:57.667
Got a teensy problem.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.167
Not a big deal.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.767
But the producers, they're
can be calling me any minute,

03:00.867 --> 03:02.267
and they want to be my agent.

03:02.367 --> 03:03.033
So?

03:03.133 --> 03:04.733
I don't have an agent.

03:04.833 --> 03:08.533
But, your agent called
me to cancel my birthday.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.400
I don't really have
time for this right now.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.267
I normally do it myself and just
call [inaudible] But they're

03:14.367 --> 03:16.567
professionals, so I don't know.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.733
Meg?

03:17.833 --> 03:18.767
You're on your own mate.

03:18.867 --> 03:19.700
Like I was on my birthday.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.967
Ug.

03:24.067 --> 03:24.867
Hello there.

03:24.967 --> 03:27.333
Bloody hell, I'll do it.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.500
All right Brits,
let's talk money.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.967
I want 10%.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.167
Well good luck today.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.967
Really.
- Really.

03:34.067 --> 03:38.167
Really, really
delighted for you.

03:38.267 --> 03:39.667
Uh, I better go.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.100
Off to the promotions job?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.033
That you two have inexplicably
moved on from before me.

03:44.133 --> 03:45.333
This is a [inaudible] abyss.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.967
Remember when I used
to do permanent work?

03:48.067 --> 03:49.467
So degrading.

03:49.567 --> 03:54.067
Of course I remember Bunny,
It was literally yesterday.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.233
[music playing]

04:03.067 --> 04:05.000
Hey babydolls.
So good to meet you.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.100
So cool.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.567
You're our new boss, ya?

04:07.667 --> 04:08.367
No.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.833
Just doing the same as you.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.733
What?

04:12.833 --> 04:15.000
You're doing this with us?

04:15.100 --> 04:17.600
Oh my god, Babes.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.367
How old are you, though?

04:19.467 --> 04:20.433
Hello girls.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.900
Looking lovely.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.333
Where's Malcolm?

04:24.433 --> 04:26.567
Lawsuit is pending, can't
go into any more details.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.500
It's not settled.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.100
It's not not settled.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.400
Anyway, you are?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.467
I'm Meg.

04:31.567 --> 04:32.933
On you're Meg.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.200
Right.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.100
Yeah.

04:38.033 --> 04:40.000
Hi Bunny, I'm
Ciaran, the director.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.967
So, have you met Alex Reid?

04:42.067 --> 04:43.233
Alex Reid?

04:43.333 --> 04:44.133
Jordan's ex-husband.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.067
The cage fighter.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.367
He's in this too?

04:46.467 --> 04:48.033
Yes, yep.

04:48.133 --> 04:51.067
He can get a touch
frustrated with us all,

04:51.167 --> 04:53.900
so he's very passionate
about this project.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.933
Oh, well sure.
Me too.

04:55.033 --> 04:55.900
Me too.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.433
And you've read the script?

04:58.533 --> 05:00.200
All of it.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.200
Yep.

05:01.300 --> 05:01.933
Yeah.

05:02.033 --> 05:02.900
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.033
Great because--

05:04.133 --> 05:05.600
Where do you
think you're going?

05:05.700 --> 05:06.567
Do I look like I'm finished?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.033
Sorry, you were saying?

05:23.567 --> 05:25.600
You know what Meggles?
May I call you Meggles?

05:25.700 --> 05:26.333
No.

05:26.433 --> 05:27.700
You know what?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.300
It would be most helpful if
you looked after the shampoos

05:29.400 --> 05:30.067
in the van.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.467
Do they need looking after?

05:31.567 --> 05:33.233
Don't worry about that.
Just pop into the van, Meg.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.033
Why?

05:34.133 --> 05:35.167
Just pop into the van, Meg.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.333
That's it, great stuff.

05:36.433 --> 05:37.267
Good girl.

05:40.933 --> 05:42.867
All the way in Meg.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.133
Ow.

05:44.233 --> 05:47.367
A bit further.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.233
A bit further.

05:49.333 --> 05:53.333
That's it so, now we see,
Meg, the general idea.

05:53.433 --> 05:55.933
There we are.

05:56.033 --> 05:58.367
Well I quit.

05:58.467 --> 05:59.100
Hello?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.467
Three, take one.

06:00.567 --> 06:01.633
Mark it.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.100
OK that's great.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.833
So what we're after here is
just the movement, Bunny.

06:04.933 --> 06:07.400
OK, so we're going to be CJI-ing
all the side stuff in later.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.467
So if you just hold
your hands like you're

06:09.567 --> 06:11.333
holding on to some
bicycle handlebars.

06:11.433 --> 06:14.700
And just move both of your
hands from side to side.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.633
That's lovely.

06:16.733 --> 06:17.567
A bit faster now.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.200
Just go quickly.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.400
Quickly, quickly.
That's good.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.300
Yeah.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.633
Maybe lick one of
the handlebars.

06:24.733 --> 06:25.867
Just give it a good lick.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.933
Yeah, At an angle.

06:29.033 --> 06:29.867
That's it.

06:29.967 --> 06:30.867
Yeah.

06:30.967 --> 06:31.900
Ok, that's really great Bunny.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.067
Just keep going.

06:34.167 --> 06:37.167
Just keep working away
on those handlebars.

06:37.267 --> 06:38.433
What is CGI again?

06:38.533 --> 06:40.733
Science stuff Bunny,
just science stuff.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.733
Oh, you're in a
bit of a rush now.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.133
Oh no, now, some
of that bacteria

06:44.233 --> 06:46.467
has leapt up onto your
hair and face and glasses.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.400
Oh, oh dear.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.733
Perfect.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.733
[music playing]

07:01.367 --> 07:02.000
Hi Laura.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.567
Hey Nathan.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.700
What's happened to Terri?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.433
He's been away for a week.
- Yeah, out sick.

07:07.533 --> 07:08.267
Poor fucker.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.900
How's he going to afford that?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.200
What do you mean?

07:11.300 --> 07:13.200
What do you mean?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.233
He is getting paid.
He's on sick leave.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.333
What?

07:16.433 --> 07:18.033
Do you mean we get paid
even if we're sick?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.100
Of course.

07:24.367 --> 07:27.433
[munching]

07:27.533 --> 07:30.267
Wha't going on?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.300
I'm a bit lost,
but I think this

07:32.400 --> 07:35.600
prick the polka-dot dungarees,
his stalls was [inaudible]

07:35.700 --> 07:37.700
No, I mean, what are
you doing home so early?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.467
I found out about sick days.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.467
What a world Meg.

07:41.567 --> 07:43.667
Hamlet's here.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.633
How was it then?

07:45.733 --> 07:47.133
I smashed it.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.033
I'm practically Cate Blanchett,
and I'm not even kidding.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.300
I have a trailer, and a slave.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.567
No, he's not a slave, mate.

07:52.667 --> 07:53.733
He's a slave.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.367
And he gets me shit.

07:55.467 --> 07:56.733
And there's an all-day buffet.

07:56.833 --> 07:57.667
A free buffet?

07:57.767 --> 07:58.800
Fucking hell.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.833
Can I come tomorrow?

07:59.933 --> 08:00.900
I can pull another sick day.

08:01.000 --> 08:01.833
Sure.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.833
Well, that's not fair.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.900
If Laura goes, I get to go.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And actually, now I'm
thinking about it.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.433
Working on a film
is my main dream.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.200
Can I come too?

08:11.300 --> 08:12.667
I won't have to be paid.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.067
I'll treat it just like work
experience, or something.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.367
Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.
Just come with.

08:15.467 --> 08:16.500
When you're the lead,
you can pretty much

08:16.600 --> 08:17.233
do whatever you want.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.467
Everyone loves me so--

08:22.167 --> 08:23.000
BUNNY: Morning everyone.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.567
I'm here.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.133
LAURA: This is f-ing.

08:27.233 --> 08:28.233
BUNNY: - Oh, you're so sweet.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.500
I guess I'm just
so used to it now.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.667
It's just so
fascinating to see how

08:31.767 --> 08:33.133
it all works behind the scenes.

08:33.233 --> 08:36.133
Just one little soup spoon
on guys, if you could not

08:36.233 --> 08:38.100
talk to me while we're here.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.733
Are you joking?

08:39.833 --> 08:40.967
Upppppa pa.

08:41.067 --> 08:44.133
It's just, I'm kind
of a big deal, ya?

08:44.233 --> 08:45.900
And I think it'd be really
confusing for people

08:46.000 --> 08:49.633
if they saw me with the work
experience girl and, you know,

08:49.733 --> 08:50.533
this.

08:53.100 --> 08:53.900
Thanks guys.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.967
I knew you'd understand.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.967
Wow.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.733
PAUL: Who are you again?
- I'm Meg.

08:59.833 --> 09:00.867
I'm Bunny's friend.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.967
She said I could
do work experience.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.733
Aren't you a bit old to
be doing work experience?

09:04.833 --> 09:07.133
I'm glad you noticed, Paul.

09:07.233 --> 09:10.700
You see, I've decided on
a little career change.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.433
Filmmaking is my main dream.

09:12.533 --> 09:15.300
Oh god please stop.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.667
Look, this film is a nightmare.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.233
The last thing I
need is to waste

09:19.333 --> 09:23.400
time showing some directionless,
overgrow millennial the ropes.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.800
But we do need all
the help we can get.

09:28.900 --> 09:29.900
Oh, I Thank you.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.067
I wouldn't thank me yet, love.

09:31.167 --> 09:31.800
CREW (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
Come in Paul.

09:31.900 --> 09:32.400
Got a problem.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.167
What?

09:41.033 --> 09:41.933
150 quid.

09:42.033 --> 09:43.733
It's a joke.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.433
No wonder they can't
find any extras.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.467
[music playing]

09:53.933 --> 09:57.000
Hi Nathan.
No.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.567
I'm really sick.

09:58.667 --> 09:59.833
What's wrong?

09:59.933 --> 10:07.100
Uh, Bubbly skin flaps, burning
hands and scalp throps.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.233
Yeah it does sound
unbelievable, doesn't it?

10:09.333 --> 10:10.467
I'll send you a photo.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.600
What the fuck is this?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.500
It's the biscuits.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.433
You think I can give a
plate of biscuits to Alex Reed

10:20.533 --> 10:22.867
looking like that?
I'll be sacked, Meg.

10:22.967 --> 10:23.767
Laughed out of town.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.067
Jesus Christ.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.333
You do want this work
experience, don't you?

10:26.433 --> 10:27.667
Yes yes.

10:27.767 --> 10:31.267
Then get your shit together.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.200
BUNNY: Morning everyone.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.333
Another day down the
tinsel mines, am I right?

10:36.433 --> 10:37.133
Oh, hey, Brian.

10:37.233 --> 10:38.367
BRIAN: My name's not Brian.

10:38.467 --> 10:39.800
Oh, Bunny, can I
ask you something?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.867
It's about--

10:42.967 --> 10:45.733
[music playing]

10:48.167 --> 10:50.067
OK so where we are
now is Count Dracula

10:50.167 --> 10:51.633
has got into the blood
samples in the lab,

10:51.733 --> 10:55.700
and he's taking the
form of evil bacteria.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.767
Oh, Dracteria.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.467
Now it makes sense.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.600
You've not read the--

11:00.700 --> 11:01.733
Never mind.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.400
So you're in the
lab, your colleague

11:03.500 --> 11:04.933
and mentor, Alex Reid, is away.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.300
Some of the bacteria you're
working on in the Petri dish,

11:07.400 --> 11:10.800
it swarms out, and it starts
to have unwanted sex with you.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.200
The bacteria rapes me?

11:12.300 --> 11:13.900
No, it just has
unwanted sex with you.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.067
OK.
What's the difference?

11:15.167 --> 11:16.600
Shall we just give
it a little go?

11:16.700 --> 11:18.733
Yeah.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.600
Scene Four, Take one.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.633
OK and action.

11:22.733 --> 11:26.300

OK cut.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.300
Cut.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.533
Cut.

11:29.633 --> 11:30.767
Great effort, Bunny.

11:30.867 --> 11:31.967
Love that.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.200
Just to see where
it takes us, do you

11:33.300 --> 11:35.700
think you could do
the next one and just

11:35.800 --> 11:36.933
enjoy it a little bit more?

11:37.033 --> 11:38.667
But It's raping me.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, but it's sex, isn't it?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.400
Yeah?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.333
You follow?

11:46.767 --> 11:47.800
Ah.
Gotcha.

11:47.900 --> 11:48.867
Scene four Take two.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.133
OK action

11:51.233 --> 11:52.100
(SCREAMING) Oh, no.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.233
Oh, yeah. yeah.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.000
Yeah.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.000
But no. no, no, no no.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.833
OK just Bunny.

11:58.933 --> 12:01.233
Stop, stop.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.400
OK.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
OK, that's great.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.933
We're still not quite
getting it, are we?

12:05.033 --> 12:06.467
So I'll tell you what?

12:06.567 --> 12:08.867
Don't worry, just follow my
lead, I'll talk you through it.

12:08.967 --> 12:09.967
OK?

12:10.067 --> 12:10.867
OK action Bunny.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.800
It's painful, ow.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.567
(SCREAMING) Ow, ow, ow.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.333
Now try to feel the
bacteria swarming into it.

12:17.433 --> 12:18.067
Yeah?

12:18.167 --> 12:20.033
(SCREAMING) Eww, Eww.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.867
DIRECTOR: Ahh, It's swarming.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.133
On no.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.667
It's scary, It's scary, Bunny.

12:25.767 --> 12:26.967
Oh hello.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.767
Oh, starting to enjoy it
a little bit more now.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.067
Oh, oh, oh.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.400
These bacteria they're
really going to town me.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.767
Oh that's right.
- (SCREAMING) Oh, Oh.

12:32.867 --> 12:33.867
Oh, Oh,

12:33.967 --> 12:35.267
DIRECTOR: Oh, it's
sexy, it's hot.

12:35.367 --> 12:36.033
It's hot.

12:36.133 --> 12:36.967
Keep it yeah.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.600
That's it, keep it going.

12:38.700 --> 12:44.767
Good and come.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.267
(SCREAMING) Ahhhhhhhhh.

12:50.967 --> 12:52.700
Great, that's lunch everyone.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.667

13:01.100 --> 13:03.133
Bring today's
chocolates from work,

13:03.233 --> 13:05.133
and I'm getting
paid for two jobs.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.233
BUNNY: Great.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.800
Have you gotten
Ben Boney's agent?

13:07.900 --> 13:08.733
Best day ever.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.433
I hated it.

13:10.533 --> 13:13.467
Working on a film is absolutely
nothing like the blooper

13:13.567 --> 13:14.700
reels on YouTube.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.100
I thought it'd just be
people dicking about.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.800
I'm gonna have to
call in sick tomorrow.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.167
Good call mate.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.933
MEG: But then, what if it
is still my main dream?

13:23.033 --> 13:24.400
This could be my big break.

13:24.500 --> 13:29.933
I could be the next massive
female director like,

13:30.033 --> 13:33.467
uh, like--

13:33.567 --> 13:35.900
Hmmm.
- Meg.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.367
Do you want some real
talk from someone who

13:37.467 --> 13:38.567
is currently living her truth?

13:38.667 --> 13:39.367
No.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.133
Sometimes life is hard ya?

13:41.233 --> 13:43.600
Like sometimes you have
to fight for your dreams.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.833
Take me.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.200
The director decided
that the film hasn't

13:46.300 --> 13:47.467
good enough nudity in it.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.433
So even though it's
not part of the story.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.600
They need me to
take my clothes off.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.933
For the good of the film.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.633
And you said doing
promo work was degrading.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.500
BUNNY: You're just jealous
Meg, because I am a star,

13:57.600 --> 13:59.800
and you can't even arrange
some biscuits on a plate.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.200
Oh, yes.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.733
Alex Reid and I had a
good old laugh about it.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.333
Ok.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.133
Fine.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.667
My career is in tatters.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.300
But jealousy aside, they are
taking a piss, and using you

14:12.400 --> 14:13.433
tits.

14:13.533 --> 14:14.367
No they're not.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.467
Yes they are.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.267
You'll just end up on
YouPorn Do you think

14:17.367 --> 14:19.567
Meryl Streep is on YouPorn?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.367
She isn't last checked.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.333
I guess I am kind
of like Meryl Streep.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.833
But I don't want to
be a YouPorn again.

14:25.933 --> 14:29.167
But nudity is empowering now.

14:29.267 --> 14:30.300
I thought that was the thing.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.567
Bunny, they're
making a power play,

14:32.667 --> 14:34.267
and your tits are the chips.

14:34.367 --> 14:37.667
We can't all just take our
tops off whenever someone tells

14:37.767 --> 14:39.767
us to, and call it empowering.

14:39.867 --> 14:42.233
That's not feminism.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.000
Is it?

14:43.100 --> 14:43.967
[inaudible]

14:44.067 --> 14:45.333
I don't know.

14:45.433 --> 14:46.433
No?

14:46.533 --> 14:47.967
You've got to take
back the power, Bunny.

14:48.067 --> 14:51.633
That is, if you want them
to know who the star is.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.133
I am.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.600
I am the star.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.367
Sure.

slaughtering an orphan.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.600
Of course we need
a fucking orphan.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.933
Morning Paul

15:06.033 --> 15:07.733
Oh God, you're back are you?

15:07.833 --> 15:09.400
I'm having a nightmare.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.033
This whole thing is a shit show.

15:12.133 --> 15:14.700
And that friend of yours
might just be the worst

15:14.800 --> 15:16.567
actress I have ever seen.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.500

15:23.000 --> 15:23.833
Poor scenes.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.333
Fucking poor scenes.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.800
Look, she even open
the fucking door.

(SCREAMING) IDIOTS

15:30.067 --> 15:31.933
And now two extras
have just dropped out.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.933
So I needed to find
the replacements.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.433
Ya?

15:35.533 --> 15:36.600
(SCREAMING) Now.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.533
Right, yes.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.700
Copy that.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.700
I won't let you down. boss.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.633
That way.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.167
Fuck me.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.333
Sorry what do you mean you're
not comfortable with nudity?

15:50.433 --> 15:52.233
I just really feel
like for this scene

15:52.333 --> 15:54.267
the nudity is gratuitous.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.867
I thought my character
would be wearing clothes.

15:56.967 --> 15:59.467
Right, It's a woodland
orgy dream sequence.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.333
So it wouldn't be a very
erotic woodland orgy

16:01.433 --> 16:03.400
dream, if everybody
kept their clothes on.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.433
Would it?

16:04.533 --> 16:06.900
It's just not very
feminist-y is it?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.300
It is, actually.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.800
Because there's nothing
more feminist-y than taking

16:10.900 --> 16:11.967
your clothes off for your art.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.133
It's empowering.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.567
And you see, this
is what I thought.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.533
But look, I am serious
actor, so you need to respect

16:17.633 --> 16:20.067
my truth and my body.

16:20.167 --> 16:22.200
I'll tell you who's
a serious actor.

because he is a professional.

One tit.
- No

16:37.233 --> 16:38.400
- Bottom
- No

- Bottom of one tit.
- Nope.

What if you were to
just wear, I don't know,

16:41.800 --> 16:44.400
a slightly see-through dress,
just so we got the sense of it.

two replacements.

one at such short notice,

was wrong about you.
