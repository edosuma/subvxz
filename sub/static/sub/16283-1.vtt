I didn't like it,

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.914

to support her habit

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.144
than selling her body
on the street.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.980

kept a journal?

her apartment, but...

There's no going back.

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:23.050
That's why today
is the day that I die.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.898
But I'm going
to make it right...

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.597
so I'm not going alone.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.681

Uh...

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.055
I'm sorry.

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:04.459
I'm so sorry, Alex.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.169
I never meant
to hurt you or Lanie.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.034
You got to believe me.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.199
Why are you saying that?

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.643
I love you both
with all my heart.

Hey, Brogan.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:03.217
Callahan, found a couple matches
on that journal you dropped off.

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.690
We had to fume it,
but besides yours,

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:08.354
we found one
belonging to Royce Walker.

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:14.700
I know.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.225
Thanks.

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:29.537
Who's got your piece, Oleg?

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:31.312
I don't own one.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:34.183
- Oh.
- I do not believe in violence.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.246
I doubt your girlfriend
would agree with that.

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.024
All right,
listen to me very carefully,

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.219
you fucking douche bag.

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:42.785
A cop was shot last night,
and your gun was involved.

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:43.887
A cop?

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:46.956
I guess somewhere
a saint just got his wings.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:49.628
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
- That's all you got?

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:52.570
No, no, no.
He's got a lot more than that.

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.699
So maybe it's time
you stopped cracking wise

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:55.969
and answered the question.

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.470
You don't get it.
You get three hots and a cot

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.276
for doing your old lady.
That's easy time.

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.781
But for killing a cop...

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:05.375
How the fuck could
I kill a cop while I'm here?

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.545

"Conspiritzia."

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.217
That's close enough.

if you pulled the trigger,

You had to get rid
of Logue, huh?

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.230
Why me?

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:11.031
Why did it have to be me?

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:15.032
I remember watching you on TV

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.339
begging your savior
to come forward

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.935
so you could thank him
in person.

It was touching.

What if that journal
had a different ending?

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:35.621
What would happen if your savior
came back into your life...

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.691
...and you had the chance
to repay him?

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:47.506
How far would you go, Cal?

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.697

Maybe I should get
a lawyer present.

from Oleg Emelyanenko.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.401
It states that Royce Walker

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.406
found out Logue
was an undercover officer

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:29.374
and ordered a hit on him.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:32.207
You discovered this information

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:34.042
in the course
of your investigation,

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.945
and when you went
to confront Walker,

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:38.610
he and his men reacted
in a life-threatening manner.

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:41.051
You had no choice

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:45.080
but to use deadly
and justifiable force.

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.621
And the rest just gets
swept under the rug,

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:50.219
