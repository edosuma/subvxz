WEBVTT

00:02.206 --> 00:05.384
Dude, who the hell put all
these dirty dishes in my bed?

00:06.880 --> 00:08.836
Probably the same person
who couldn't find

00:09.145 --> 00:10.704
a clean bowl,
and is being forced

00:10.705 --> 00:12.512
to eat his cereal
out of a box!

00:14.693 --> 00:16.882
Hey, that's a really good idea.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.740
Do we have another box?

00:19.682 --> 00:21.013
Okay, people,
fair warning:

00:21.014 --> 00:23.273
If you don't want it chewed up,
ripped up or peed on,

00:23.274 --> 00:24.971
I suggest you move it
to higher ground.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.078
Oh, cool.
Is grandma coming over?

00:28.139 --> 00:30.586
No. Lola, Megan's dog.

00:30.587 --> 00:32.713
I volunteered to watch her
while she's out of town.

00:32.714 --> 00:34.171
Ben, that dog hates you.

00:34.172 --> 00:36.241
Well, so did Megan
before she got to know me.

00:37.221 --> 00:39.744
Seriously, I gotta figure out a way
to get through to that dog.

00:39.745 --> 00:41.856
If I don't, I'm gonna be
the one begging strangers

00:41.857 --> 00:42.940
to scratch my belly.

00:44.416 --> 00:46.868
Ben, no.
You can't possibly bring

00:46.869 --> 00:49.203
one more living thing
into this apartment.

00:49.522 --> 00:53.350
If you haven't noticed,
we already have a baby and a giant.

00:56.633 --> 00:58.902
Look, I really feel like

00:58.903 --> 01:00.479
you're starting to take
advantage of me.

01:00.793 --> 01:03.304
That is not true.

01:03.305 --> 01:04.555
Hey, can you change Emma real quick?

01:04.556 --> 01:05.766
- Thanks.
- Oh, my god.

01:10.183 --> 01:13.475
There they are! Ha ha!
My two favorite girlfriends.

01:13.476 --> 01:15.681
Oh, we are gonna have
so much fun together.

01:16.267 --> 01:19.042
That is what I was just
saying to Lola. Here.

01:20.356 --> 01:21.991
Are you sure you two
are gonna be okay together?

01:22.315 --> 01:24.343
Of course.
How could we not?

01:25.435 --> 01:26.239
Aw, come here.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.237
Yeah, we love each other,
don't we, Lola?

01:33.342 --> 01:34.463
Please don't eat me.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.178
Hold my hand, Emma.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.127
I'm scared.

01:51.916 --> 01:53.334
Quit your whining,
Wheeler.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.628
Bonnie's beauty bar guarantees

01:55.964 --> 01:58.513
that you are going to love
your new haircut.

02:00.343 --> 02:02.369
Oops.
Not gonna love that.

02:02.370 --> 02:03.742
Just...

02:04.177 --> 02:06.210
That's it!
We're done here.

02:07.583 --> 02:09.727
Oh, hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
Quick question:

02:10.054 --> 02:13.471
Was Danny born messy or is he
just honing his skills here?

02:14.851 --> 02:16.409
Sadly, he came out
that way.

02:16.714 --> 02:18.661
I actually stopped
going into his bedroom

02:18.662 --> 02:20.328
after he turned 14.

02:20.329 --> 02:21.866
For multiple reasons.

02:23.405 --> 02:25.750
When we finally moved out,
I just tossed a match in there

02:25.751 --> 02:27.293
and let the insurance company
deal with it.

02:29.787 --> 02:31.463
Stay, Lola, stay!  No! Ow!

02:31.914 --> 02:35.016
I just don't get it!

02:35.563 --> 02:37.916
I play with her,
nuzzle her, rub her.

02:37.917 --> 02:39.322
Why won't she love me?

02:39.821 --> 02:41.525
Clearly, you've never
been married.

02:42.846 --> 02:44.746
Hey, your hairy little lady friend

02:45.085 --> 02:47.405
kept me up half the night
whining and yapping.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.089
I could hear her all the way
over at my place.

02:50.090 --> 02:53.526
And my blender was on full tilt
for margarita Monday.

02:55.072 --> 02:56.199
Mom, it's Thursday.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.508
Don't judge me.

02:58.091 --> 02:59.682
Whoo! All right.
Big news, people.

03:00.202 --> 03:02.326
So I have an interview tomorrow
at my old law firm.

03:02.846 --> 03:04.188
I'm getting my job back.

03:04.189 --> 03:05.426
- Nice!
- Nice!

03:05.884 --> 03:08.797
Wait, the firm that fired you
for not passing the bar?

03:09.188 --> 03:12.881
That is completely...
Not totally false.

03:13.823 --> 03:15.192
But, you know, I'm moving on.

03:15.193 --> 03:18.043
And I've passed the bar and I've
brushed up on the latest case law,

03:18.044 --> 03:22.843
and I'm gonna show them that
Riley Perrin, legal eagle, is back.

03:23.989 --> 03:27.508
Oh, dear dear sweet
naive little Riley,

03:28.127 --> 03:30.897
sure "knowledge" is great,

03:30.898 --> 03:33.423
but you might want
to update your look.

03:33.827 --> 03:36.205
You know?
Add a little pizzazz!

03:38.027 --> 03:39.902
I've got pizzazz.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.252
Honey, that was just p-sad.

03:43.201 --> 03:44.866
All right, boys, help me out here.

03:44.867 --> 03:45.926
Who you hiring?

03:45.927 --> 03:47.692
Smart or hot?

03:47.693 --> 03:50.108
- Hot. Hot.
- Totally hot.
- Definitely hot.

03:51.012 --> 03:54.285
Well, since Moe, Larry and Curly
aren't on the selection committee,

03:54.286 --> 03:55.345
I think I'm good.

03:56.122 --> 03:58.545
Really? Because Bonnie's beauty bar

03:58.546 --> 04:00.701
is now featuring home spray tanning.

04:01.064 --> 04:02.922
Oh, I don't know.
Those always look kinda fake.

04:03.239 --> 04:03.969
Mm-hmm.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.793
Riley, take your pick...

04:06.759 --> 04:07.814
Mocha frappuccino

04:09.021 --> 04:10.223
or cinnamon toast.

04:13.833 --> 04:16.153
Well, I mean, maybe
I could use a little color.

04:20.747 --> 04:22.852
Oh, my god.
What have you done to me?!

04:23.515 --> 04:24.590
I don't know
what happened.

04:25.048 --> 04:28.919
Oh, "dilute solution with water."

04:30.085 --> 04:31.946
Oh, I bet that was it.

04:32.892 --> 04:35.339
My interview is tomorrow.
What am I gonna do?

04:35.728 --> 04:36.987
I know you're upset.

04:38.082 --> 04:40.261
So I won't charge you
for this session.

04:47.441 --> 04:49.144
Ben!

04:49.467 --> 04:50.853
What is going on with that dog?

04:51.450 --> 04:53.467
Who cares, man?
I'm having a great time.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.720
Okay, gentlemen,

04:57.062 --> 04:58.952
I believe "thank yous"
are in order.

04:58.953 --> 05:01.375
I have handled our whole
sanitation situation.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.226
I have hired a cleaning crew.

05:03.227 --> 05:04.647
Dude, that's great!

05:04.648 --> 05:06.173
No, not a great idea.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.888
I don't want a bunch
of strangers coming up in here

05:07.889 --> 05:09.176
touching all my stuff.

05:10.332 --> 05:12.010
I'd like for you to meet
our cleaning crew,

05:12.414 --> 05:13.931
Ashley and Debbie.

05:14.237 --> 05:15.892
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.769
Oh, please. Please come in
and touch all of my stuff.

05:21.418 --> 05:23.562
We're just gonna get
started, if that's okay.

05:24.418 --> 05:25.462
Uh...

05:25.463 --> 05:27.081
Guys, don't we have
something better to do?

05:27.082 --> 05:28.653
- Yeah yeah yeah. We coming, all right.
- Yeah, we're coming. We're doing it.

05:29.699 --> 05:31.033
We're just gonna get
out of your way.

05:31.034 --> 05:32.270
We need to pick up Emma at daycare

05:32.576 --> 05:33.463
and get a beer.

05:33.872 --> 05:34.921
Maybe not in that order.

05:35.453 --> 05:37.906
Ladies, just leave the key
under the mat when you're done.

05:37.907 --> 05:39.669
Oh, and you may want
to stay out of my room.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.072
My girlfriend's dog is in there,

05:41.073 --> 05:43.063
And she's half-mop, half-devil.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.951
And my room is in the back.

05:46.734 --> 05:48.531
I could show you
where it is, if you'd like.

05:49.251 --> 05:51.004
Oh, my god. I love you.

05:55.427 --> 05:57.638
Riley, hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.067
But it is really so good to see you...

06:00.068 --> 06:01.904
What the hell happened to you?!

06:03.277 --> 06:05.345
Spray tan gone awry.

06:05.346 --> 06:08.079
I tried to scrub it off,
but I think that just made it angry.

06:11.061 --> 06:12.268
Ms. Jenson,

06:12.269 --> 06:15.009
please don't be put off
by my cheddar-like appearance.

06:16.087 --> 06:17.710
There is no one with more knowledge

06:17.711 --> 06:19.253
about this law firm than me.

06:20.329 --> 06:21.807
Except for maybe you.

06:23.259 --> 06:26.162
Riley, honestly, even if you had
passed the bar the first time

06:26.477 --> 06:28.055
we still were gonna let you go.

06:28.764 --> 06:29.951
You're just too...

06:30.692 --> 06:32.132
Nice.

06:33.219 --> 06:34.697
Nice?

06:34.698 --> 06:36.519
You think I'm too nice?

06:36.520 --> 06:39.343
There is no one
more un-nice than I am!

06:39.344 --> 06:40.346
Sorry.

06:40.925 --> 06:41.950
Ow.

06:42.785 --> 06:44.275
There's nothing wrong
with being nice.

06:44.742 --> 06:47.228
But it doesn't really make
for a good attorney.

06:47.229 --> 06:49.400
We crush people for a living.

06:50.116 --> 06:51.654
And that's what I wanna do.

06:51.655 --> 06:53.556
I wanna crush people too.

06:55.117 --> 06:56.230
Really?

06:56.584 --> 06:59.452
Then what happened to that person
that turned you into a yam?

07:00.734 --> 07:02.125
You suing them?

07:02.650 --> 07:04.655
Um. Well, no. Not exactly.

07:05.014 --> 07:07.204
I rest my case.
I think we're done here.

07:07.205 --> 07:09.761
Oh, um... uh, wait.
I'm not suing her, because...

07:10.645 --> 07:13.321
We're going straight
to mediation.

07:13.322 --> 07:15.946
- You are?
- Oh, my God, yes.

07:16.898 --> 07:19.870
And I am gonna take her
for everything she's worth.

07:20.277 --> 07:21.237
Hmm.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.932
Maybe I have
underestimated you.

07:24.426 --> 07:25.705
So you're gonna reconsider?

07:26.024 --> 07:27.642
This may be a way
that you can prove to me

07:27.643 --> 07:29.043
that you can really do this.

07:29.662 --> 07:31.384
You can use our conference room.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.118
You want me to do
the mediation here?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.153
Yes.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.534
Think of it
as an extended interview.

07:36.535 --> 07:40.632
Oh, this is going to be fun!

07:42.007 --> 07:43.238
Oh, and if we're lucky,

07:43.720 --> 07:45.557
someone might cry.

07:47.253 --> 07:49.020
I could almost guarantee it.

07:55.831 --> 07:57.269
Okay, they were pretty and all,

07:57.270 --> 07:58.942
but that cleaning crew sucked.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.100
Where's our tv?

08:01.441 --> 08:02.758
I think we've been robbed.

08:03.998 --> 08:05.011
I can't believe we got robbed

08:05.012 --> 08:07.038
right after we finally got
the place clean!

08:08.495 --> 08:10.496
Dude, it was those girls.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.437
What else did they take?

08:13.735 --> 08:15.286
Oh, no. Oh, no.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.518
Oh, no no no no...

08:18.295 --> 08:19.526
They took Lola!

08:20.329 --> 08:22.593
Now I really regret
paying them in advance.

08:26.261 --> 08:29.009
Okay, I've been up and down
every block in the neighborhood.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.791
I put up flyers on
every corner in a five-mile...

08:32.847 --> 08:34.288
Is that a new tv?!

08:35.429 --> 08:36.905
Yeah, you told us
to do something,

08:36.905 --> 08:38.049
- so we did something.
- Yeah.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.034
It is so important

08:40.035 --> 08:41.984
to have your priorities
straight in a time like this.

08:42.548 --> 08:44.125
It's not our priority.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.471
We need to get Lola back.

08:45.933 --> 08:47.472
Calm down, bro.

08:47.473 --> 08:49.490
Who could know that
hot maids with no references

08:49.491 --> 08:50.823
would rip us off?

08:52.163 --> 08:53.433
Everyone!

08:55.318 --> 08:57.330
Did you at least call the cops?
What did they say?

08:57.331 --> 08:58.728
Well, they said
they'd get back to us

08:58.729 --> 09:00.613
in like five to seven days.

09:00.614 --> 09:03.490
And then they laughed at us
for giving our keys to strangers.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.260
Five to seven days?!

09:06.261 --> 09:07.728
I don't have
five to seven hours.

09:07.729 --> 09:09.795
<i>Megan's gonna...</i>

09:09.796 --> 09:11.501
Ah! It's her!

09:11.502 --> 09:12.707
Answer? Don't answer?

09:12.708 --> 09:13.594
Don't answer.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.167
Megan, hello.

09:18.355 --> 09:19.707
Hi. Uh, yeah.

09:20.879 --> 09:22.180
Lola. Uh-huh.

09:22.976 --> 09:24.284
You wanna talk to her.

09:25.049 --> 09:27.196
Okay. Uh, yeah.
She's right here.

09:27.197 --> 09:28.635
Let me grab her.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.694
Oh, that's a good girl.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.042
Yeah...

09:33.000 --> 09:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:48.297 --> 09:50.028
Okay, that's a good girl.

09:52.685 --> 09:54.792
See? All good.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.237
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

09:56.754 --> 09:58.376
We need to find those girls.

09:58.377 --> 09:59.722
Danny, do you still have their number?

09:59.723 --> 10:00.827
Yeah, but...

10:00.828 --> 10:02.661
I would not recommend them to anyone.

10:06.186 --> 10:07.692
What are we supposed to do?

10:07.693 --> 10:10.613
Set up a sting operation
and catch them ourselves?

10:11.508 --> 10:12.824
Tucker, that's brilliant!

10:13.574 --> 10:15.213
Nobody's gonna let us
just use their apartment

10:15.214 --> 10:16.651
to catch a couple of thieves.

10:17.619 --> 10:19.429
What if we don't tell that nobody?

10:20.724 --> 10:23.532
And by nobody, I mean mom.

10:24.949 --> 10:26.116
This is perfect!

10:26.507 --> 10:28.081
I paid those girls
for two weeks.

10:30.945 --> 10:32.746
<i>You're suing me?!</i>

10:32.747 --> 10:35.780
Mrs. Wheeler,
I am a carrot in heels.

10:38.126 --> 10:39.520
You owe me this.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.556
- Fine.
- Yes!

10:42.557 --> 10:43.840
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you...

10:43.841 --> 10:44.849
Whoa whoa whoa,
tangerine dream.

10:44.850 --> 10:45.899
I just bought this.

10:49.477 --> 10:51.076
Oh. Hey, Riley.

10:51.077 --> 10:52.344
I didn't know you were gonna be... wait.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.573
Is there something different about you?
You change you hair?

10:55.290 --> 10:57.440
Yeah.
I changed my hair.

10:58.417 --> 10:59.977
You look good.
You look really good.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.370
So mom,
I'm going to the store

11:03.371 --> 11:05.213
and wondered if
you needed anything.

11:05.214 --> 11:06.920
Oh. Honey, that's really sweet.

11:06.921 --> 11:08.481
Actually, I got a list on the fridge.

11:08.482 --> 11:10.159
And I'm making Emma's schedule.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.659
Which days will you be
around your apartment?

11:12.660 --> 11:14.266
Well, every day
except tomorrow.

11:14.810 --> 11:17.805
I have to go downtown
and let Riley publicly humiliate me,

11:17.806 --> 11:18.992
so I'm kinda booked.

11:20.604 --> 11:21.872
Tomorrow.

11:21.873 --> 11:23.832
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.767
Well, wait wait.
Don't you need my grocery list?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.903
What would I want that for?

11:30.206 --> 11:31.926
And they wonder why margarita Monday

11:31.927 --> 11:33.185
is three days a week.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.286
Riley, as much as I'd love
for you to get your job back,

11:37.609 --> 11:40.186
you're really gonna have
to show me that you can do this.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.897
I won't let you down.

11:41.898 --> 11:43.244
I promise.

11:44.968 --> 11:46.109
Come on in.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.441
Ladies.

11:51.453 --> 11:53.436
Mrs. Wheeler, I'm Margaret Jenson,

11:53.437 --> 11:55.711
I'll be mediating.
I believe you know Ms. Perrin,

11:55.712 --> 11:57.494
who'll be acting as her own attorney.

11:57.495 --> 11:59.461
And this is my attorney.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.422
Mister... Hector.

12:05.347 --> 12:06.610
You brought an attorney?

12:06.611 --> 12:08.439
Don't worry,
he's just my doorman.

12:11.209 --> 12:12.009
All right,

12:12.730 --> 12:15.046
let's get this little
shakedown session started.

12:15.521 --> 12:16.260
Oh!

12:17.152 --> 12:18.392
Mrs. Wheeler!

12:18.393 --> 12:19.412
I got it!

12:19.413 --> 12:20.546
I said I got it.

12:23.036 --> 12:25.515
All right.

12:27.149 --> 12:28.370
Carry on.

12:29.277 --> 12:30.846
Um, all right.

12:30.847 --> 12:33.259
For the record,
are you Bonnie Wheeler,

12:33.260 --> 12:34.772
owner of Bonnie's beauty bar?

12:46.865 --> 12:48.600
Yes.

12:51.246 --> 12:53.424
And is it true that you do not have

12:53.425 --> 12:56.735
a current license to practice
cosmetology in the state of New York?

13:00.883 --> 13:03.182
I would like to plead
the fifth at this time,

13:03.183 --> 13:06.783
and if it pleases the court,
we'd like to break for lunch.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.313
Mrs. Wheeler, if we do not
come to a swift conclusion

13:13.314 --> 13:15.482
to these proceedings,
I will petition for

13:15.483 --> 13:17.016
criminal charges to be brought.

13:17.017 --> 13:19.908
<i>And I will shut down
Bonnie's beauty bar for good.</i>

13:19.909 --> 13:21.968
I mean, it only takes
one look at my skin

13:21.969 --> 13:23.948
to prove that you have no skills,

13:23.949 --> 13:27.385
no talent and have no right
to be working in this business.

13:27.386 --> 13:29.923
Mrs. Wheeler, you are a disgrace!

13:31.744 --> 13:33.064
Well...

13:33.786 --> 13:35.866
Let me tell you something.

13:42.170 --> 13:44.433
Here they come...

13:46.470 --> 13:48.004
I'm so sorry.

13:48.852 --> 13:50.158
You're right, you know?

13:50.702 --> 13:52.762
I don't know what I'm doing.

13:53.519 --> 13:56.564
<i>But this business
is all that I have left.</i>

13:57.188 --> 13:59.771
You know, I'm just trying
to restart my life.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.131
After the divorce
and then Ben having a baby...

14:04.132 --> 14:06.237
Mrs. Wheeler, are you okay?

14:06.238 --> 14:08.045
No! No, I'm not!

14:10.555 --> 14:13.310
I really thought I could do this,
but I can't.

14:14.049 --> 14:15.625
Everything that you said was true.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.527
If this doesn't work out,

14:17.528 --> 14:20.571
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:20.912 --> 14:23.399
No no, please don't cry.
I'm so sorry.

14:23.755 --> 14:25.317
It's gonna be all right.

14:25.744 --> 14:27.223
I know.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.247
I'm just trying to help you.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.126
Oh.

14:35.746 --> 14:37.465
So...

14:37.466 --> 14:39.391
I'm guessing you two know each other.

14:42.866 --> 14:44.763
Alright, so, the girls
will be here any minute.

14:44.764 --> 14:46.841
- Danny, is the key under the mat?
- Check.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.539
- Tucker, video camera ready?
- Check.

14:48.842 --> 14:50.477
A place to hide?
Oh, right.

14:51.093 --> 14:52.325
I was in charge of that.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.493
Closet.

14:53.494 --> 14:55.399
So we'll catch 'em stealing on tape,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.349
then turn them over to the
police, and get Lola back.

14:58.858 --> 14:59.760
Everybody in.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.267
One at a time!

15:07.711 --> 15:09.118
Okay, go.

15:10.887 --> 15:12.150
Knock knock.

15:12.151 --> 15:13.457
Anybody home?

15:13.973 --> 15:14.881
See?

15:14.882 --> 15:16.274
Told you they wouldn't be here.

15:17.079 --> 15:19.247
And what's the first thing they did?

15:19.248 --> 15:21.253
Buy themselves a new tv.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.663
These guys are such idiots.

15:26.647 --> 15:28.074
They should be here by now.

15:28.075 --> 15:30.160
When you set this up,
you said 3:00, right?

15:30.589 --> 15:33.542
Yeah. But they might have had trouble
understanding me because...

15:34.058 --> 15:37.808
I disguised my voice
by using clever accent.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.986
You didn't use
your own phone, did you?

15:45.377 --> 15:47.138
Yeah, what other phone
would I use?

15:47.633 --> 15:50.399
A phone that doesn't have
a number they recognize!

15:52.437 --> 15:54.358
Danny, what is
the matter with you?!

15:54.359 --> 15:55.778
They know this whole
thing was a setup.

15:55.779 --> 15:57.506
Those girls are never
gonna show up now.

15:57.507 --> 15:58.890
<i>They're here.</i>

15:58.891 --> 16:01.187
Go go go go go go go!
Come on, come on.

16:02.414 --> 16:04.485
All you had to do
was give me a heads-up.

16:04.486 --> 16:05.397
I mean, it would have been nice

16:05.398 --> 16:07.594
to know you were planning on
auditioning for a telenovela.

16:08.839 --> 16:10.233
I was good, wasn't I?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.259
- No!
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?

16:13.916 --> 16:15.138
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

16:15.139 --> 16:17.703
And why are you doing it in my closet?

16:19.247 --> 16:21.384
Danny hired a cleaning crew
who robbed us

16:21.385 --> 16:23.569
and stole Megan's dog,
so we hired them to rob you.

16:24.997 --> 16:26.895
And happy mother's day.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.638
Mom, they stole Megan's dog.

16:29.639 --> 16:30.842
I have to get her back.

16:31.306 --> 16:33.581
All I have left is this
little pink whistle.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.425
Lola?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.419
She's back in our apartment!

16:40.420 --> 16:41.459
With the girls!

16:41.958 --> 16:43.989
And they are taking
our new tv!

16:43.990 --> 16:45.357
Go go go go!

16:45.358 --> 16:46.484
Mom, call the police!

16:50.807 --> 16:52.620
Answer me this question,
miss lawyer.

16:52.937 --> 16:55.106
Is it possible to sue your own kids

16:55.107 --> 16:56.714
for pain and suffering?

16:57.794 --> 16:58.934
Probably not.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.043
But...

17:01.771 --> 17:04.272
I think I know someone we can sue.

17:04.602 --> 17:06.172
Oh, I'll call Hector.

17:06.173 --> 17:07.763
He's almost done updating my will.

17:10.017 --> 17:11.035
Freeze!

17:12.501 --> 17:13.449
We missed them.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.022
They got it.

17:15.355 --> 17:17.550
And it still had that new tv smell.

17:18.919 --> 17:19.920
Did you catch them?

17:19.921 --> 17:21.945
I took the elevator.
They are not in there.

17:21.946 --> 17:23.843
We blew it!
Oh, my God.

17:23.844 --> 17:24.969
What am I gonna do?

17:24.970 --> 17:26.068
What am I gonna tell Megan?

17:27.877 --> 17:29.485
It's her!

17:29.486 --> 17:30.717
Answer? Don't answer?

17:30.718 --> 17:31.741
Don't answer.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.002
Megan, hi.

17:36.024 --> 17:36.944
Lola?

17:41.265 --> 17:42.195
Come on.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.084
I think she might
have a cold.

17:49.085 --> 17:50.232
Okay, bye now.

17:50.912 --> 17:52.319
<i>Look, I know what
I did was wrong,</i>

17:52.320 --> 17:53.472
and I'm sorry.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.819
But I hope you can see now

17:54.820 --> 17:56.896
how truly passionate I am
about working here.

17:56.897 --> 17:59.450
And I will literally
try anything to make my point.

17:59.765 --> 18:00.997
Really?

18:00.998 --> 18:02.103
That's all you got?

18:03.513 --> 18:06.588
Actually, no. It's not all I got.

18:07.307 --> 18:08.610
Mrs. Wheeler?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.512
Yeah?

18:10.513 --> 18:12.506
Ow ow ow ow.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.774
Ow ow ow...

18:16.612 --> 18:18.498
You have got to be kidding me.

18:19.186 --> 18:20.360
Oh, I wish I was.

18:20.361 --> 18:22.039
But your office furniture is faulty

18:22.040 --> 18:24.705
and has led to untold pain
and suffering to my client.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.418
Fine. Go ahead. Sue me.

18:30.419 --> 18:31.939
Oh, I'm suing you, all right.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.906
For her medical treatments,
her recovery time,

18:34.207 --> 18:35.638
Not to mention the potential

18:35.639 --> 18:37.903
long-term consequences
of her injuries.

18:37.904 --> 18:40.305
And when this goes to trial,
don't be surprised

18:40.306 --> 18:42.951
if every dirty little trick
this firm has ever played

18:43.296 --> 18:45.122
becomes a matter of public record.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.641
You wouldn't dare.

18:49.096 --> 18:50.144
Oh, try me.

18:51.425 --> 18:53.035
Who's too nice now?

18:58.278 --> 19:00.028
Welcome back, Riley.

19:02.022 --> 19:03.456
You can start on Monday.

19:03.457 --> 19:05.490
Yes.
Thank you so much. All right.

19:05.832 --> 19:07.001
Let's go, Mrs. Wheeler.

19:07.002 --> 19:09.263
Oh, thank God.
This thing was driving me crazy.

19:09.264 --> 19:10.277
Did you see how good...

19:14.549 --> 19:16.634
The truth...
just tell her the truth.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.889
Lola's at the groomers'.

19:23.043 --> 19:23.945
The groomers'?

19:24.261 --> 19:26.308
Ben, what's going on?

19:27.524 --> 19:29.085
Look, Megan.

19:29.463 --> 19:30.770
I just have to be honest with you.

19:32.502 --> 19:34.946
Lola ran off with a schnauzer
she met at the park.

19:36.724 --> 19:38.089
Or...

19:38.390 --> 19:39.794
Lola!

19:43.827 --> 19:45.273
Maybe she was kidnapped

19:45.274 --> 19:47.725
by two girls who tried
to ransom her back to me.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.377
Kinda wished you mentioned that
before the whole schnauzer story.

19:51.980 --> 19:53.705
So you paid the ransom?

19:54.208 --> 19:56.190
No, I called the cops,
and they arrested the girls

19:56.191 --> 19:57.601
when they showed up with the dog.

19:58.391 --> 19:59.764
Wow, that is a really good plan.

20:01.043 --> 20:02.014
Ben.

20:02.770 --> 20:04.129
How could you let this happen?

20:04.790 --> 20:06.817
I trusted you
to take care of my baby

20:06.818 --> 20:08.573
and you let her get stolen.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.993
Then lied to me about it.

20:10.814 --> 20:13.124
You know she's not a real baby, right?

20:15.885 --> 20:17.830
I just don't think
I can ever forgive you for this.

20:18.627 --> 20:19.932
What are you saying?

20:21.332 --> 20:22.894
That I can't see you anymore.

20:23.436 --> 20:24.525
Bye, Ben.

20:37.191 --> 20:38.681
<i>Lola, calm down.</i>

20:38.682 --> 20:40.279
<i>What is the matter
with you?!</i>

20:45.719 --> 20:49.167
You wanna make sure that you
get a good foam going.

20:49.168 --> 20:50.388
Like this?

20:51.407 --> 20:54.733
No. Scrub those plates
like they owe you money!

20:55.402 --> 20:57.075
Now you're just moving dirt around.

20:57.076 --> 20:58.415
Give me that!

20:58.416 --> 20:59.582
Honestly.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.198
Who can't figure out
how to wash a plate?

21:02.716 --> 21:05.317
You are lucky that you
can change light bulbs

21:05.318 --> 21:09.055
and smoke detectors, otherwise
you'd be completely useless.

21:13.465 --> 21:15.176
So lemony.
