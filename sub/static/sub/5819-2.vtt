persona non grata, fair game.

12:15.197 --> 12:17.102
Unh!

12:17.103 --> 12:19.503
[Gagging]

12:21.140 --> 12:22.707
Huhhh!

12:26.546 --> 12:29.314
Aah! Aah!

12:29.315 --> 12:32.017
[Growls]

12:32.018 --> 12:34.720
Now he asked you what
your hunters did to my wife.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.356
Answers now.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.124
Err.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.994
I'll have them inspect
the road kill in the morning.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.229
Jackson, your time is short.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.931
You go to the compound, fetch the
chains from the carriage room.

12:58.911 --> 13:02.514
My darling Lucien,
I'm quite happy

13:02.515 --> 13:04.816
to stand here and watch you die,

13:04.817 --> 13:06.350
or you can invite me in.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.654
The choice is yours.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.056
[Indistinct chatter]

13:29.709 --> 13:30.942
Aah! Ohh!

13:30.943 --> 13:34.780
Hey. Hey.
It's just me.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.915
Maybe not the best time to
be sneaking up on people.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.084
Oh, sorry.
It's been a long night.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.986
I saw you walking in.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.387
Thought you might not mind
pouring me a drink.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.196
Nightcap?

13:51.197 --> 13:55.500
You'll find bourbon on basically
every horizontal surface.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.803
Or we could skip
to the fun part.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.308
Freya! It is about time
you brought a gentleman home

14:03.309 --> 14:04.676
to meet the family.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.645
I'm Freya's brother,
and you are?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.080
No. Don't tell me.
Let me guess...

14:08.081 --> 14:11.249
Brad, Chad, Brody?
Let's go with Brody.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.951
What are your intentions
for my sister?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.765
Shall we discuss a dowry?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.156
Bro, what the...

14:18.157 --> 14:20.024
Leave now.

14:25.077 --> 14:26.732
Well, he was drunk.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.433
No one will believe his story.

14:28.434 --> 14:31.436
Not 3 months ago,
you utterly despised me.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.637
Now you're playing
protective brother.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.074
I'm sure you're quite capable
of protecting yourself

14:36.075 --> 14:39.711
from the scourge
of fraternity row.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.813
I need you to perform
a locator spell.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.147
Hayley's missing.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.120
You're worried about her.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.089
I prefer to know
the whereabouts of my enemies.

14:51.090 --> 14:55.059
Besides, Hayley has a history
of taking what's mine.

14:56.329 --> 15:00.598
No. You're afraid
she's truly lost.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.672
I'll need the best
connection to Hayley.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.173
You'll have to wake hope.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.179
So any progress
on the killer's profile?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.581
Listen.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.617
I know Vincent said
that I could help,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.952
but you should probably
consult someone

15:20.953 --> 15:24.022
with a little more experience.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.625
Yeah. True.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.294
I've seen you around town before

15:29.295 --> 15:31.629
with Klaus Mikaelson,

15:31.631 --> 15:34.266
a mysterious
philanthropist/artist

15:34.267 --> 15:35.967
with no past on record.

15:35.968 --> 15:39.437
Is he a friend or a patient?

15:39.438 --> 15:40.905
You know, I think
we should call it.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.407
Cami.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.910
I'm not allowed to
discuss my clients.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.607
I know who you are.

15:49.415 --> 15:50.815
Right.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.886
My brother murdered
a church full

15:54.887 --> 15:56.855
of seminary students,
so my name must be

15:56.856 --> 15:57.989
familiar to the local pd.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.323
It is.

16:00.964 --> 16:04.863
But after Vincent brought you
around, I did further research.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.666
For example, your uncle
Kieran's death last year,

16:07.667 --> 16:10.735
that autopsy report was
just full of plot holes.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.671
He had a heart attack.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.040
Perfectly rational explanation.

16:15.041 --> 16:18.943
There's always a perfectly
rational explanation.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.750
Your family has a whole
century of strange deaths,

16:25.751 --> 16:27.318
unexplainable behavior,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.353
grave robberies, beheadings,

16:29.355 --> 16:30.755
missing persons,

16:30.756 --> 16:32.756
police reports with entire
sections blacked out.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.826
Whenever there's
a problem in the quarter,

16:34.827 --> 16:37.596
there's an O'Connell
either causing it

16:37.597 --> 16:39.163
or cleaning it up.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.106
Are you accusing me
of something?

16:48.107 --> 16:50.208
No.

16:50.209 --> 16:55.446
I just think your whole good
catholic family thing is a cover.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.617
I just haven't figured out
what you're covering yet,

16:58.618 --> 17:00.431
but I will.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.246
[Whispering chant]

17:29.248 --> 17:31.615
[Whispering chant]

17:40.426 --> 17:41.825
[Gasps]

17:44.964 --> 17:46.393
I can't find her.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.090
There's... nothing.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.659
It's like she doesn't exist,

18:14.660 --> 18:15.760
or sh...

18:15.761 --> 18:16.895
Or she's dead.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.729
Jackson: No, no.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.097
No. You have to find her.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.775
No. No. Please.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.277
Please. You need
to listen to me. Please.

18:38.718 --> 18:39.951
[Bones crack]

18:39.952 --> 18:42.286
[Panting]

18:43.389 --> 18:45.156
[Crying]

18:45.157 --> 18:46.191
Oh! Ohh!

18:46.192 --> 18:49.159
Oh, Klaus, the chains.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.627
Please. I know you
don't want to help me,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.031
but Hayley can be used
against Klaus.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.865
She's the only one
that he truly fears.

18:58.404 --> 19:01.673
Ohh! Freya, please!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.241
Please do the spell again!

19:03.242 --> 19:05.909
I can't go a month
with... agh! Unh!

19:05.911 --> 19:07.445
Davina: Please, please.

19:07.446 --> 19:10.280
I need you to listen to me.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.117
Agh!

19:12.118 --> 19:13.564
Ohh.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.556
It stopped.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.731
Aah! Aah!

19:26.732 --> 19:28.132
[Neck snaps]

19:36.142 --> 19:37.574
Aah!

[Groaning]

19:41.147 --> 19:43.547
[Screaming]

20:02.849 --> 20:04.282
My contacts will get back to me

20:04.283 --> 20:05.817
if they have any
information about a wolf

20:05.818 --> 20:08.620
matching your description.

20:08.621 --> 20:10.689
You're going to need Niklaus'
blood for that wound.

20:10.690 --> 20:12.324
Just FYI.

20:12.325 --> 20:13.592
I'm sure he'll respond favorably

20:13.593 --> 20:15.460
once the mother of
his child has been...

20:15.461 --> 20:16.628
Recovered.

20:16.629 --> 20:17.895
Oh, feel free to have a drink.

20:17.897 --> 20:20.632
She's not dead, just mouthy.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.334
I compelled her quiet.

20:22.335 --> 20:24.302
You can spare me
the counterfeit camaraderie.

20:24.303 --> 20:25.771
So you say
that you're in conflict

20:25.772 --> 20:27.172
with those of my sire line.

20:27.173 --> 20:29.307
Am I to assume
that the lord Tristan Du Martel

20:29.308 --> 20:30.942
is up to his usual tricks?

20:30.943 --> 20:32.878
This is no quarrel, Elijah.

20:32.879 --> 20:34.713
We are on the brink of war.

20:34.714 --> 20:35.881
Tristan knows that if
he kills Klaus

20:35.882 --> 20:37.783
he will eliminate
all his enemies.

20:37.784 --> 20:39.451
And so wait.
By this logic,

20:39.452 --> 20:42.354
am I to assume that I am
your ultimate target?

20:42.355 --> 20:45.557
If I kill you,
then I trade all of the money,

20:45.558 --> 20:46.992
the women, the jets

20:46.993 --> 20:48.260
all for an eternity on the run

20:48.261 --> 20:50.829
from Nik and Rebekah.

20:50.830 --> 20:51.897
Leave this city.

20:51.898 --> 20:53.131
No one needs your protection.

20:53.132 --> 20:54.332
The white oak was destroyed.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.033
We cannot be killed.

20:59.205 --> 21:00.872
You're wrong.

21:00.873 --> 21:01.940
Talk to Nik.

21:01.941 --> 21:03.241
He's seen the prophecies.

21:03.242 --> 21:05.510
Visions of darkness
surround your family.

21:05.511 --> 21:10.549
You are not immune
to death, Elijah,

21:10.550 --> 21:12.717
and you don't seem
particularly fazed.

21:12.718 --> 21:16.655
Well, I'm no stranger
to death, young Lucien.

21:16.656 --> 21:19.491
Or third-rate prophecies,
for that matter,

21:19.492 --> 21:22.426
or perhaps your immortality
has finally soured you.

21:22.428 --> 21:24.729
After all, you've abandoned
your eternal effort

21:24.730 --> 21:26.832
to save Nik's soul.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.701
What's left for
the legendary Elijah Mikaelson

21:29.702 --> 21:32.369
without that single motivation?

21:58.498 --> 22:00.097
We got a problem.

22:04.036 --> 22:07.939
Marcel: 11 bodies,
a lot of pissed off loved ones.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.407
They thought it was
a vampire thing,

22:09.408 --> 22:10.909
but all my guys
were accounted for

22:10.910 --> 22:12.643
at the abattoir last night.

22:15.147 --> 22:16.514
Where's my mom?

22:18.618 --> 22:20.117
Where is she?

22:22.421 --> 22:25.624
Oh, no! No, no!

22:25.625 --> 22:28.025
[Sobbing]

22:32.698 --> 22:34.765
Shh.

22:45.978 --> 22:47.946
I taught you better
than to leave your leftovers

22:47.947 --> 22:49.514
in the streets,

22:49.515 --> 22:51.483
my streets.

22:51.484 --> 22:53.451
You'll have to elaborate, mate.

22:53.452 --> 22:56.320
Two bodies were found sporting
rather memorable lacerations.

22:56.322 --> 22:57.889
Are you exorcising your demons

22:57.890 --> 23:01.293
by carving up
the innocents of New Orleans.

23:01.294 --> 23:04.829
Ha ha! Your family's full of
unfounded accusations today,

23:04.830 --> 23:07.332
and if I was the culprit,
why would you care?

23:07.333 --> 23:09.434
We used to make fantastic
messes together.

23:09.435 --> 23:11.903
There is a delicate
balance in this city.

23:11.904 --> 23:13.471
There are rules.

23:13.472 --> 23:15.473
Ahh. And people you care about.

23:15.474 --> 23:18.710
You can't afford weaknesses
like that right now.

23:18.711 --> 23:19.978
[Sighs]

23:19.979 --> 23:21.780
Speaking of weaknesses,
there is a wolf

23:21.781 --> 23:24.983
chained to my wall who claims
he took a chunk out of your arm.

23:24.984 --> 23:26.818
Come see me.
I'll give you my blood

23:26.819 --> 23:30.055
in exchange for your word
that these killings will stop.

23:30.056 --> 23:33.358
I'm afraid your family dog
missed the mark friend.

23:33.359 --> 23:35.894
Barely a scratch.
No venom reached the skin.

23:35.895 --> 23:39.064
You listen carefully, friend.

23:39.065 --> 23:42.300
My city has enjoyed months
of relative peace.

23:42.301 --> 23:44.836
If that peace is
any way disrupted,

23:44.837 --> 23:47.205
the next gruesome murder
will be yours.

23:47.206 --> 23:49.608
Heh. Now there's
the Klaus I know.

23:49.609 --> 23:50.808
[Beep]

23:55.047 --> 23:58.083
Can I get you some water

23:58.084 --> 24:00.018
or something?

24:00.019 --> 24:01.519
Let me out.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.922
It's dawn. I haven't
turned back yet.

24:03.923 --> 24:05.190
It doesn't make any sense.

24:05.191 --> 24:07.124
I need to find Hayley.

24:08.694 --> 24:11.429
I can feel the curse
in your blood.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.198
Something's restraining it,

24:13.199 --> 24:16.133
but you could transition
at any moment.

24:18.670 --> 24:21.238
Where the hell is that bastard?

25:04.498 --> 25:07.666
Versailles witches,
this is an unbearable tragedy.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.136
In the wake of such sorrow,
please allow me

25:10.137 --> 25:12.972
to bring you under
the protection of the ancestors.

25:12.973 --> 25:14.874
Whoever did this was strong

25:14.875 --> 25:17.710
and, for all we know,
might return.

25:17.711 --> 25:18.978
If you follow my rules,

25:18.979 --> 25:22.014
I promise to keep you safe.

25:22.015 --> 25:24.976
Nothing like this
will ever happen to you.

25:26.052 --> 25:27.479
Not again.

25:29.823 --> 25:31.222
Hayley, what happened?

25:31.224 --> 25:32.725
Klaus: Hayley.

25:32.726 --> 25:35.795
Come to apologize
for all your transgressions?

25:35.796 --> 25:38.364
Do you have any idea what
you have taken from me?

25:38.365 --> 25:39.697
Aah!

25:41.168 --> 25:42.535
The very thing you
sought to take from me...

25:42.536 --> 25:44.503
The chance to raise
our daughter.

25:44.504 --> 25:46.405
Your punishment fits your crime.

25:46.406 --> 25:48.841
Your family was
ruining her life.

25:48.842 --> 25:50.209
My family saved her life

25:50.210 --> 25:51.644
while you were off
playing hide-and-seek

25:51.645 --> 25:53.078
in the forest!

25:53.079 --> 25:54.980
Unh!

25:54.981 --> 25:57.383
Unh!

25:57.384 --> 25:58.918
Aah! God.

25:58.919 --> 26:00.152
Let me go.
He'll kill her!

26:00.153 --> 26:01.487
He'll kill you!

26:01.488 --> 26:03.155
There's a very short list
of people

26:03.156 --> 26:04.657
who've tried to take
hope away from me,

26:04.658 --> 26:06.859
and you're the only one
left breathing.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.361
Are you that delusional, Klaus?

26:09.362 --> 26:12.464
You cursed all of us,
every wolf that I fought for,

26:12.465 --> 26:14.433
everyone that stood up
for our daughter.

away from their families.

26:18.872 --> 26:20.773

you chose over hope.

Is that what you were
planning on telling her

26:25.879 --> 26:27.146
when she got older
and asked for me,

26:27.147 --> 26:29.080
that I abandoned her?

for her is something better!

We're safe for now.

28:26.234 --> 28:27.767
Klaus: Good for you.

28:27.768 --> 28:29.202
I'll have your bedroom made up.

28:29.203 --> 28:30.604
The only way that I will
stay under your roof

28:30.605 --> 28:31.971
is if I'm in a coffin.

allow hope out

28:47.155 --> 28:48.522

28:48.523 --> 28:50.991
I might pay a visit
to the management.

28:50.992 --> 28:52.225
The fact that hope will
never be out of earshot

28:52.226 --> 28:55.528
should assuage
your incessant paranoia.

28:55.530 --> 28:57.330
So we are to listen
as my daughter

28:57.331 --> 28:59.032
is raised by savages?

28:59.033 --> 29:01.268
Because everyone here
is so damn civilized?

29:01.269 --> 29:03.570
Brother, you created
the problem.

29:03.571 --> 29:05.804
This might well be the solution.

29:07.642 --> 29:09.742
Put the place in Jackson's name.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.613
Klaus won't be invited in.

29:35.670 --> 29:36.903
You're gonna need to take care

29:36.904 --> 29:38.371
of those bodies discreetly.

29:38.372 --> 29:40.240
I know. Keep everything
covered up,

You're the one who told me
I had to use a sign of force.

29:51.085 --> 29:52.752
Against the one
who went after you.

29:52.753 --> 29:56.223
I did not suggest a massacre.

29:56.224 --> 30:00.994
Are you really gonna lecture
me about dead witches?

30:00.995 --> 30:02.762

We're always at war,
and collateral damage happens.

30:04.799 --> 30:06.733
I learned that from you.

30:06.734 --> 30:08.501
Guess who I learned it from.

You're not gonna get the better
of Klaus by becoming him.

You need a break.

30:14.008 --> 30:15.942
Vincent should have
never gotten you into this.

30:15.943 --> 30:18.111
You're too young to have that
kind of blood on your hands.

30:18.112 --> 30:20.347
I'm a french quarter witch.

30:20.348 --> 30:23.082
I was born with blood
on my hands!

30:27.688 --> 30:30.322

be in the cemetery, Marcel.

Thank you for this.

31:37.024 --> 31:39.259
You know, there was a moment
at the bonfire last year

31:39.260 --> 31:42.262
when I thought we would be ok,

31:42.263 --> 31:45.064
that hope could be raised
by a real family.

31:48.769 --> 31:51.503
For the first time, I was happy.

that away from me.
