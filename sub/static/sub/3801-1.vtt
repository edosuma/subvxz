♪♪

00:17.974 --> 00:19.454
Am I gonna get fed?

00:19.541 --> 00:20.933
There's like a table,
I'm leaning on it,

00:21.021 --> 00:23.197
I feel like I'm alone
in an airport.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.676
What's the second question?

00:24.763 --> 00:26.983
God, that's a great question.
Uh...

00:27.070 --> 00:28.898
Let me see that.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.161
I'm curious if you're just
making this up at this point.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.945
[Kevin Pollak]
I will never be seen
on camera nor my voice heard.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.904
It's one of those things where
you kind of have to reiterate

00:34.991 --> 00:37.559
the question and the answer.Hey, then you have
a shot at a hit.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.822
Do you think emotionally
questionable people

00:39.909 --> 00:42.564
are drawn to stand-up
slash performing?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.392
It was a way for me to deal

00:44.479 --> 00:47.003
with my chronic shyness
and introversion.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.484
I'm crazy already, so don't try
and make me the responsible one.

00:49.571 --> 00:52.313
Or are they done in
by the life

00:52.400 --> 00:54.532
that opens up to them?

00:54.619 --> 00:56.665
I don't know if all comics
go through this, where you go,

00:56.752 --> 00:58.449
"I'm never gonna be
funny again.

00:58.536 --> 01:01.017
I don't know how
I was able to go this far."

01:01.104 --> 01:03.498
But I always assert
that the funniest people
aren't comedians,

01:03.585 --> 01:06.675
just like the best-looking girls
aren't models or whatever.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.981
You'll meet people
that are shoe store salesmen

01:09.069 --> 01:10.679
that'll fucking
knock you over.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.550
[chuckles]

01:12.637 --> 01:15.031
And then it's just my job
to sit there and yell at drunks.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.512
And that's kind of
the difference between
comedy and theater.

01:17.599 --> 01:21.081
But I can do that.
I'm from a large family.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.170
[Pollak] It's okay if
I use all that, right?Use whatever you want.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.520
You know, here's the thing, that
you can use whatever you want

01:25.607 --> 01:27.087
because what's gonna happen?

01:27.174 --> 01:28.262
You're gonna get people--

01:28.349 --> 01:29.698
They're gonna not call me?

01:29.785 --> 01:31.308
They're already
not calling me, so--

01:31.395 --> 01:32.918
so it doesn't
matter what I say.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.660
The Mexicans, the Jews,
the Blacks, the Irish.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.836
Not a lot of funny Germans.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.711
It'd be much better
if you were mediocre,
'cause if you were mediocre,

01:42.798 --> 01:45.148
then you would actually have
to get good at something else,

01:45.235 --> 01:47.890
and you know, comedy would be
just something you do
by the water cooler.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.675
But if you're truly
brilliant at being funny,

01:50.762 --> 01:53.809
then, yeah,
you can guarantee

01:53.896 --> 01:57.247
that your marriages are
not gonna work and your kids
will turn out fucked up.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.728
Well, this is
a deep question.

01:59.815 --> 02:00.903
[Pollak]
Action!

02:00.990 --> 02:02.992
A'ight.[Pollak laughing]

02:03.079 --> 02:05.255
What's the name of this thing?"Misery Loves Comedy."

02:05.342 --> 02:09.085
And do you think that's true?That's the last question,
so wait.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.741
[Bob Saget]
Okay.

02:12.828 --> 02:15.613
My dad was always
the funny guy of the family.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.225
My dad made me laugh
a whole lot.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.617
My dad.My dad.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.358
My father.My father was probably

02:21.445 --> 02:23.186
the first guy that I said,
"Oh, man, he's funny."

02:23.273 --> 02:24.666
[Kevin Nealon]
It wasn't that
his jokes were great,

02:24.753 --> 02:26.407
but I could see
the silliness

02:26.494 --> 02:29.584
and I saw that,
uh, how much fun

02:29.671 --> 02:31.716
he was having
making other people laugh.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.415
And he always had a ton of,
like, basic, like,

02:34.502 --> 02:36.156
down the middle street jokes

02:36.243 --> 02:37.896
and I would see him,
like, kill.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.464
He loved--
Can I swear?[Pollak] Please, yes.

02:40.551 --> 02:43.554
He also loved, like,
shit jokes and fart jokes,

02:43.641 --> 02:46.818
so I still don't like 'em,
'cause that's my rebellion.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.647
He told me, he said,
"If you swallow gum,

02:49.734 --> 02:52.084
your shit comes out
like a yo-yo."

02:52.172 --> 02:56.001
And I didn't find out until
years later that he was lying.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.874
He would just make up these
crazy stories about my life.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.049
He said--

03:00.136 --> 03:01.485
there's this Pakistani dish

03:01.572 --> 03:03.444
called biryani
that's my favorite--

03:03.531 --> 03:05.620
and he said, "Oh, it's 'cause
when you were a little baby,

03:05.707 --> 03:08.144
we dropped you in
a pot of it and we forgot."

03:08.231 --> 03:10.799
And I didn't know until
I was 13 that that was a lie,

03:10.886 --> 03:12.627
'cause it was just
part of my reality.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.542
I was like, "Oh, yeah,
that's what happened to me."

03:14.629 --> 03:16.631
And he was like, "No, I was just
trying to impress your mom."

03:16.718 --> 03:19.242
Like, he was flirting
with my mom. I'm like...

03:19.329 --> 03:21.853
[Pollak]
As he was five-years-old,
he's flirting with your mom.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.551
Yeah, yeah.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.292
I was like, "I think
it's in the bag, I'm five.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.424
I think you got this one."

03:27.511 --> 03:30.384
Um, so, yeah, my dad
was always very funny.

03:30.471 --> 03:33.256
My dad and I don't really
get along that well.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.040
He's actually stepdad,

03:35.127 --> 03:38.522
and was not supportive
at all of the career.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.307
In fact, at one point,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.439
I played ukulele in my act

03:42.526 --> 03:45.355
and did very well,
got on television doing it,
the whole thing,

03:45.442 --> 03:48.228
but I remember the first time
I played the ukulele for him,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.230
he just looked at me
and was like,

03:50.317 --> 03:53.842
"What the hell do you think
you're gonna do with that?"

03:53.929 --> 03:57.324
But I did have, like,
so many teachers, especially--

03:57.411 --> 04:00.065
There was a teacher
named Mr. Beasley,

04:00.152 --> 04:01.850
psychology teacher,
and he was just, like,

04:01.937 --> 04:04.156
"Wayne, you really
got something.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.030
"Like, you're funny in class,
you're not disruptive,
you're smart.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.555
Like, you should try this.
You should definitely try this."

04:11.642 --> 04:13.992
I was like, "Oh."

04:14.079 --> 04:16.430
[Lewis Black]
So she was always like, "Yeah,
this is never gonna happen.

04:16.517 --> 04:19.868
You're insane.
I don't know what you're doing.
Nobody knows what you're doing."

04:19.954 --> 04:21.348
My father was pretty low-key,

04:21.435 --> 04:24.046
but my father was like,
"You happy? Good."

04:24.133 --> 04:26.875
My father was a lot
fucking smarter about it.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.573
My dad was funny, but not in
the way he thought he was funny,

04:29.660 --> 04:31.793
so he would try
to tell a joke,

04:31.880 --> 04:33.882
or tell a joke that
he thought was funny

04:33.969 --> 04:36.667
and then he would laugh very
loudly at the end of the joke

04:36.754 --> 04:39.627
and everyone around
the table would kind of--

04:39.714 --> 04:42.107
You'd hear the "clink,
clink, clink" of the cutlery

04:42.194 --> 04:43.674
as the joke didn't land.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.589
And then you'd think,

04:45.676 --> 04:47.243
"Please, I don't want
to catch anyone's eye,

04:47.330 --> 04:48.723
'cause if I do,
I'm just gonna go."

04:48.810 --> 04:50.464
She came to the show

04:50.551 --> 04:52.292
two hours early
and stood in the lobby

04:52.379 --> 04:56.078
and introduced herself
to every person who came in.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.820
"Hi, I'm Blanche Lewis,
I'm his mother.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.083
Hi. You're coming
to see my son."

05:01.170 --> 05:02.954
So everyone knew her

05:03.041 --> 05:05.696
and she sat right in
the middle of the theater.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.656
So I say, "So my father,
you know, he had six penises--"

05:08.743 --> 05:11.006
I'm just saying something dumb,
and she would literally,

05:11.093 --> 05:13.704
I don't want to get out of shot,
she'd stand up and go--

05:13.791 --> 05:17.491
"Oh, Bill never had six penises.
How dare you?!"

05:17.578 --> 05:19.275
[Pollak laughing]

05:19.362 --> 05:23.279
It was absolutely
the oddest show,

05:23.366 --> 05:25.281
'cause they all went, "Boo!

05:25.368 --> 05:26.848
You're putting your dad down."

05:26.935 --> 05:29.590
No, it was a joke
before she showed up.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.157
HBO used to do
a thing in Bryant Park,

05:32.244 --> 05:33.594
where you'd face the library

05:33.681 --> 05:36.248
and they would
have comics on stage,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.860
live, and no censorship

05:38.947 --> 05:41.210
during afternoons
in the summer.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.560
My mother and father
happened to be in for that

05:43.647 --> 05:45.301
and the place is packed

05:45.388 --> 05:48.130
and it's spectacular to be able
to yell the word "fuck"

05:48.217 --> 05:50.567
and throw it out
and have it hit the library

05:50.654 --> 05:52.352
and bounce back at you is--

05:52.439 --> 05:53.788
It's like heaven.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.790
And the crowd was great.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.705
I finished up
and my mother goes,

05:57.792 --> 06:00.447
"Oh, my God,
they really do like you."

06:00.534 --> 06:03.798
[laughing]

06:03.885 --> 06:05.321
There's always
been a judgment.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.670
[lowered]
"That was funny."

06:06.757 --> 06:08.106
Almost like a comic, like,

06:08.193 --> 06:09.847
"I know, but you
should have laughed."

06:09.934 --> 06:11.283
[lowered]
"Oh, I was thinking about it,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.894
if there was any ways
to improve it."

06:12.981 --> 06:15.984
I just did Letterman last week.
He found--

06:16.071 --> 06:18.160
[lowered]
"I found no room
for improvement."

06:18.247 --> 06:19.901
That's always
the first thing out of--

06:19.988 --> 06:21.946
[lowered] "However,
you can tell David Letterman,

06:22.033 --> 06:24.471
"if you have a chance, I don't
know if he's talkative,

06:24.558 --> 06:26.734
"that that set is too busy.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.649
"I mean, why are you standing
in front of New York City?

06:28.736 --> 06:30.607
"What-- what is that?

06:30.694 --> 06:32.827
There should be a nice curtain
that goes with your outfit."

06:32.914 --> 06:35.177
Well, you let me
get right on that.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.919
[Pollak] By the way,
he's not wrong.He's not wrong.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.791
That's the frustrating part.
He's not wrong.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.141
If you change your mind, you can
always go back to Conan, right?

06:44.665 --> 06:46.754
I mean, that was
literally, within--

06:47.929 --> 06:50.497
that was within
the 10 seconds

06:50.584 --> 06:53.717
of-- of his
first reaction was...

06:54.762 --> 06:56.633
"When the world
beats you to shit,

06:56.720 --> 07:00.507
you can come back with your tail
between your legs, can't you?"

07:00.594 --> 07:02.422
And I said,
"Yeah, but I'm not really--

07:02.509 --> 07:05.686
that's not really kinda what
I'm focused on right now, Dad."

07:07.339 --> 07:10.212
Now, one could make the case
that he was right.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.953
I came crawling back

07:12.040 --> 07:14.303
after being chewed up
and spit out

07:14.390 --> 07:16.479
by this goddamn town.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.829
But I would just like you for
once to go, "That was great,"

07:18.916 --> 07:20.527
but there's always a criticism.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.442
[lowered]
"Okay, so we're not allowed--

07:22.529 --> 07:25.575
So, should I say something nice
first and then I can say--"

07:25.662 --> 07:27.577
That'd be nice.
That's a start.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.667
Let's start there, but then it
comes out as Irish sarcastic.

07:30.754 --> 07:34.584
[lowered]
"Well, your jeans fit great."

07:34.671 --> 07:36.847
Acceptance is...

07:36.934 --> 07:40.677
has al--
been a big part of-- of

07:40.764 --> 07:42.549
dealing with who he was

07:42.636 --> 07:45.465
and realizing
very early in life

07:45.552 --> 07:48.119
that I was far from perfect
made it a little bit easier,

07:48.206 --> 07:51.253
but not much, and there's
a whole 'nother layer to it.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.691
It's like, when you're--
when you're a junior,

07:54.778 --> 07:57.955
you're really just
a statue built to honor

07:58.042 --> 07:59.827
that which walked
before you, right?

07:59.914 --> 08:02.394
Like, your name is his.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.007
You're-- you're going
to do what he was going to do

08:06.094 --> 08:08.226
and there's not a discussion.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.055
And as my grandfather said
before he passed away,

08:11.142 --> 08:12.796
"You're gonna fix
what he fucked up."

08:12.883 --> 08:15.582
And so whether that's
rightful pressure or not,

08:15.669 --> 08:17.192
that's-- that's pressure, so...

08:17.279 --> 08:18.585
[Pollak] How old are
you when he says that?

08:18.672 --> 08:20.108
I was 15 years old. 15.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.936
He told me he was proud of me--

08:22.023 --> 08:23.894
He was sick and he was
in hospice care at that point

08:23.981 --> 08:25.592
and he said, uh, he said,

08:25.679 --> 08:27.724
"Freddie, did you
clean your room today?"

08:27.811 --> 08:29.726
I said, "Yeah, Papa,
I cleaned my room."

08:29.813 --> 08:31.685
He said, "I'm very,
very proud of you."

08:31.772 --> 08:34.251
And you're 15, you don't realize
he's saying it for everything,

08:34.339 --> 08:36.124
but he's too much of a man
to say it, right?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.126
I go, "Yeah,
yeah, no problem."

08:38.212 --> 08:40.128
And he goes, "You know, your
father really fucked things up."

08:40.215 --> 08:41.563
"What?"

08:41.650 --> 08:42.913
He goes,
"And it's your job to fix it."

08:43.000 --> 08:44.785
Four hours later,
he was dead.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.700
I literally was just like...

08:46.787 --> 08:49.267
"Um, I gotta get into acting."

08:49.354 --> 08:51.313
Literally, I saw Neil
Patrick Harris that summer

08:51.400 --> 08:54.142
getting people excited
for acting in my high school

08:54.229 --> 08:56.100
and I was like,
"I gotta do this shit."

08:56.187 --> 08:58.799
[Pollak]
98% of kids suffer
from "Hey, look at me,"

08:58.886 --> 09:00.931
desperate for attention.

09:01.018 --> 09:04.021
Is there a way to explain
why any of us actually chooses

09:04.108 --> 09:06.241
"Hey, look at me"
as a career?

09:06.328 --> 09:07.982
"Oh, I'm gonna devote
the rest of my life

09:08.069 --> 09:10.941
to being the center
of attention."

09:12.726 --> 09:16.164
[Stephen Merchant]
Those early teens where you
get to sort of hang out

09:16.251 --> 09:19.689
with your father and his
friends, you know, occasionally,

09:19.776 --> 09:21.648
and just sort of getting
a sense of their--

09:21.735 --> 09:23.737
of their kind of adult humor

09:23.824 --> 09:25.303
and just seeing
little glimpses of it.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.654
They were still
moderating it for the kids,

09:27.741 --> 09:29.830
but you could see
between the cracks,

09:29.917 --> 09:32.006
there was something
a little bit more edgy there

09:32.093 --> 09:33.703
and a little bit naughtier

09:33.790 --> 09:35.357
and the bad language
was kept to a minimum,

09:35.444 --> 09:37.228
but, you know,
you could see it was brewing

09:37.315 --> 09:40.884
and the off-color subjects
were in the air.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.625
I remember that being
very tantalizing, you know?

09:42.712 --> 09:44.845
Kind of wanting
to hang with them.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.282
I would sit in the pub garden,
'cause I wasn't allowed
in the pub,

09:47.369 --> 09:48.805
but sitting in the pub garden
with them and, you know,
eating a bag of crisps

09:48.892 --> 09:50.764
and kind of excited,

09:50.851 --> 09:53.462
and so that excitement of when
do I get to be part of that?

09:53.549 --> 09:56.726
And it was this dynamic of
the laughter, you'd hear, like--

09:56.813 --> 09:58.685
As a kid,
I'm just hearing, like...

09:58.772 --> 10:01.383
[murmuring]

10:01.470 --> 10:03.690
And you'd hear
this rumbling laughter

10:03.777 --> 10:07.258
and I was completely
taken by it, fascinated,

10:07.345 --> 10:10.000
and it was some of these
relatives from the past

10:10.087 --> 10:13.525
that really got me, like,
"Okay, this is something.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.962
Something going on here."

10:15.049 --> 10:16.920
And it was alcohol.[Pollak] Uh-huh.

10:17.007 --> 10:20.010
That's what I realized.
It was the booze.

10:20.097 --> 10:23.057
I was sitting around the table,
and from a very, very young age,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.320
I always dominated
the conversation.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.670
It was the one place that,
like, I fucking hung out in

10:27.757 --> 10:31.543
I could hung out forever
because people were laughing.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.460
And that was, like,
every Sunday or every Friday

10:35.547 --> 10:37.462
or every time we would have,
like, a big meal

10:37.549 --> 10:39.856
where everybody was there,
for some reason,

10:39.943 --> 10:42.729
they would always be
laughing at me and I would be
telling stories about--

10:42.816 --> 10:45.209
Sometimes it was like,
you know,

10:45.296 --> 10:49.083
terrible things, you know,
like, I got beat up a lot
when I was a kid

10:49.170 --> 10:51.128
and, like, my sister thought
it was hilarious, you know?

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
I remember one time
and she was like, "Oh, my God,

10:53.391 --> 10:55.089
how many times
did Dominic Dipento
kick your ass this week?"

10:55.176 --> 10:56.873
And I'd be like,
"It's not funny, all right?"

10:56.960 --> 10:58.832
And I'd start to cry
and then I'd turn into a joke,

10:58.919 --> 11:01.312
and then, like, it would turn
into, like, a bit or something.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.359
I don't remember a lot--
making the family laugh.

11:04.446 --> 11:07.405
More that I would laugh a lot
at the family, you know?

11:07.492 --> 11:11.279
I would laugh a lot
at my uncle's jokes

11:11.366 --> 11:13.368
and comedy shows

11:13.455 --> 11:15.109
and things like that.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.459
And it was
the feeling of that

11:17.546 --> 11:19.940
that made me interested
in comedy, I think.[Pollak] Right.

11:20.027 --> 11:23.726
It was quite a while
before you consciously made
the decision to try to make--

11:23.813 --> 11:25.989
To make a joke, yes.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.991
[Pollak]
How much later? How old--

11:28.078 --> 11:29.950
My first joke was--

11:30.037 --> 11:31.516
I was a late joker.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.605
My first joke was at 21.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.477
[Pollak laughs]
Seriously?

11:35.564 --> 11:36.913
No, no, no, no.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.481
[Pollak laughing]
That was great.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.352
I just like telling stories.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.093
I would have my family sit
around and I would be like,

11:43.180 --> 11:45.966
"Guys, I have this story,
you have to hear it."

11:46.053 --> 11:48.142
And they'd be like...
I would just make up a story

11:48.229 --> 11:49.970
as I went along,
a horrible story,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.754
just about, like, fake--

11:51.841 --> 11:53.451
Animals, I'd be like...

11:53.538 --> 11:56.498
"So this rabbit

11:56.585 --> 11:59.153
just was in the forest."

11:59.240 --> 12:01.329
And they were just like,
"We know you're making this up

12:01.416 --> 12:03.418
as you go along
and it's not good."

12:03.505 --> 12:06.508
And-- but-- and my dad would
film it and then we'd watch it

12:06.595 --> 12:09.859
and I'd be like, "Oh, my God,
this girl is gonna make it."

12:09.946 --> 12:12.340
So it was definitely
for me, personally,

12:12.427 --> 12:14.690
'cause I really don't know
about kids on purpose,

12:14.777 --> 12:17.432
but for me personally, I--

12:17.519 --> 12:19.869
My narcissism

12:19.956 --> 12:22.829
and thinking that I

12:22.916 --> 12:25.092
deserved attention

12:25.179 --> 12:29.009
was-- was reinforced
by my parents.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.359
Every kid makes up
knock-knock jokes,

12:31.446 --> 12:34.318
but it takes kids
a long time to understand it.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.625
They'll still try it.[Pollak] Right.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.802
They'll make up their own rules,
and they're funny

12:39.889 --> 12:42.544
because they've got
the idea wrong.

12:42.631 --> 12:46.461
You know, I actually
was a very, very shy kid.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.943
I don't think I was funny
until after-- until I left home.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.858
And so that's why my parents
are still surprised.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.729
They're like, "What is--
what is happening?

12:53.816 --> 12:55.557
Why-- Why are you
on Letterman?"

12:55.644 --> 12:58.299
There's something about
family, that connection,

12:58.386 --> 13:00.867
and then to have
that secret kind of

13:00.954 --> 13:02.607
sense of humor together,

13:02.694 --> 13:06.176
where the same goofy shit
makes you laugh.

13:06.263 --> 13:09.353
Like, everyone loves
my dad's political stuff

13:09.440 --> 13:12.052
and his serious
sledgehammer stuff,

13:12.139 --> 13:14.054
I love his goofy shit.

13:14.141 --> 13:17.231
I love the little moments
where he's just got a phrase

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
in between even two bits

13:18.928 --> 13:21.061
and he'll just
say a little something

13:21.148 --> 13:25.065
about Uncle Fred
or something or Steve or--

13:25.152 --> 13:26.849
just a little something,
and that--

13:26.936 --> 13:29.634
that's like the humor we shared,
was that little stuff.

13:29.721 --> 13:32.768
And I do have a memory of,

13:32.855 --> 13:34.988
I guess it was,
like, junior high,

13:35.075 --> 13:38.078
I think we were at Gelson's,
first when Gelson's
first came out,

13:38.165 --> 13:40.471
and we decided to do--

13:40.558 --> 13:41.908
It just came up.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.780
A whole produce section
in gibberish.

13:44.867 --> 13:48.915
We had an argument over
the tomatoes in gibberish.

13:49.002 --> 13:53.223
We ended up singing some sort of
gibberish folk song together

13:53.310 --> 13:57.358
and just improvised
and played and for me,

13:57.445 --> 14:00.622
that's, like, one of my most
joyful moments with him.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.450
It's the fun part
about being a dad,

14:02.537 --> 14:03.973
because there's
nothing funnier

14:04.060 --> 14:06.280
than a little kid
really hitting it right.

14:06.367 --> 14:10.066
And so my son,
I remember is he would try
to do a joke in the room,

14:10.153 --> 14:12.634
when he was like five,
he'd go--

14:12.721 --> 14:15.506
he'd try to do a joke,
he'd look at me at go,
"It didn't land, did it?"

14:15.593 --> 14:18.248
And I'm like,
"No, it didn't land.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.773
[laughing]
It didn't land."

14:21.861 --> 14:24.951
Take your desk, take your chair,
sit in the hallway.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.996
And I'd sit in the hallway

14:27.083 --> 14:28.955
of an elementary school

14:29.042 --> 14:31.914
and people, you know,
teachers would walk by

14:32.001 --> 14:33.481
and they'd go,
"Why are you out here?"

14:33.568 --> 14:35.875
And I'd go,
"'Cause I killed in there."

14:35.962 --> 14:37.789
[Dana Gould]
If you were making
a movie about somebody

14:37.877 --> 14:39.226
who became
a stand-up comedian

14:39.313 --> 14:41.228
and you put this into it,

14:41.315 --> 14:43.926
people would go,
"It's a little on the nose."

14:44.013 --> 14:47.016
The only way I could get
attention as the fifth of six

14:47.103 --> 14:49.497
was to do my bits

14:49.584 --> 14:52.195
and, literally, my dad
would have his friends over

14:52.282 --> 14:54.154
and I would get to get
out of bed and come down--

14:54.241 --> 14:56.112
[lowered]
"Do Nixon!"

14:56.199 --> 14:58.158
And I would do it and I was
eight, seven, eight years old.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.248
I mean, there's
an old picture of me, you know,
wearing Groucho glasses

15:01.335 --> 15:03.380
and, you know,
holding a bottle of booze

15:03.467 --> 15:05.992
and, you know, they used to have
a little bar area in their den

15:06.079 --> 15:07.558
and I'd go back there,
I'd try to make--

15:07.645 --> 15:10.126
What he used to tell me
to do is like, the--

15:10.213 --> 15:12.650
You know, because he sold,
you know, appliances,

15:12.737 --> 15:14.478
you know, he was always
on the cutting edge of things

15:14.565 --> 15:16.350
and you know, I think
he was one of the first guys

15:16.437 --> 15:18.395
to have his television
in a wall,

15:18.482 --> 15:20.484
so the TV in the den
was in the wall

15:20.571 --> 15:23.835
and the closet was behind it
so the back of the TV was there

15:23.923 --> 15:26.534
and I would go in the closet
and I would stand behind the TV,

15:26.621 --> 15:30.016
you know, and my grandfather
would go, "You're on
the television!

15:30.103 --> 15:32.018
I see you on the television!"

15:32.105 --> 15:33.976
He was a very funny fellow.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.979
There was a moment when I was
little in elementary school

15:37.066 --> 15:40.026
when I realized,
I'm not good at sports

15:40.113 --> 15:42.767
and this is
a daily humiliation.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.553
They would pick sides,
I'd get picked last,

15:45.640 --> 15:48.034
after the girls,
after disabled kids.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.123
And it happened every day,
twice a day,

15:50.210 --> 15:52.125
in gym class and at lunch.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.692
And I just remember
putting rocks up my nose

15:54.779 --> 15:56.346
and pretending
I was a slot machine

15:56.433 --> 15:58.566
and having people,
like, pull my arm down

15:58.653 --> 16:00.872
and then opening my nostrils
so rocks fell out.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.701
That was-- I don't think
that made me any cooler,

16:03.788 --> 16:06.008
but at the time,
it seemed like a good strategy

16:06.095 --> 16:08.358
to distract from the fact

16:08.445 --> 16:11.057
that I was not
a good soccer goalie.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.146
And then I started doing
impressions of people,

16:13.233 --> 16:16.584
you know, around the same time,
like, junior high.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.369
And that's the first time
I ever thought of myself

16:19.456 --> 16:21.545
being funny that way.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.504
Probably around when I was 15,
that's when I realized,

16:23.591 --> 16:26.855
like, this is--
I'm good at this,
I can do this.

16:26.942 --> 16:30.467
I just annoyed people
endlessly from then on.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.426
It was just way too much fun

16:32.513 --> 16:34.819
and I couldn't understand
why people would be upset.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.953
Like, I would, you know,
I was pretty relentless.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.956
I could even just pick
one person out from
the crowd of kids

16:41.043 --> 16:44.133
and I would try to crack
that person and make them laugh,
you know?

16:44.220 --> 16:46.396
I knew if I could make
this kid Damien laugh

16:46.483 --> 16:48.311
that everyone would be like,
"Oh, yeah, that-- he killed."

16:48.398 --> 16:49.965
But I thought
I was a nice kid.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.358
In my heart,
I looked at myself

16:51.445 --> 16:53.012
as a nice, sweet kid.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.493
So when a guy would frown

16:56.580 --> 16:59.627
or, you know,
even seemed sad,

16:59.714 --> 17:01.716
I'm like,
"What's wrong with you, man?

17:01.803 --> 17:04.980
This is funny.
You're a 12-year-old guy
and you have breasts.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.766
I mean, come on, why isn't--
what's not funny about that?"

17:08.853 --> 17:11.117
And you know once you kill,
you want to, like,
leave the room.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.597
You know, you have
a great joke, you're like,
"Oh, that was great.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.817
I gotta get out of here now."
It's, like, 'cause that
was so funny.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.646
[Pollak]
You were aware of you need
to exit after the laugh?

17:18.733 --> 17:21.605
Get out, 'cause that's--
Yeah, 'cause if you stay
too long, it's like,

17:21.692 --> 17:23.738
"You want me to do
that bit again?"

17:23.825 --> 17:26.175
[Christopher Guest]
I don't remember how
I found this out,

17:26.262 --> 17:29.439
but I could make a sound
that was essentially

17:29.526 --> 17:31.311
a ventriloquism sound

17:31.398 --> 17:35.010
that the teacher thought
was coming from another place.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.751
[Pollak]
Like another student?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.622
Or just another place
in the room?

17:38.709 --> 17:41.277
Another student
or another-- yeah.

17:41.364 --> 17:44.280
And I didn't--
I don't know, to this day,

17:44.367 --> 17:46.804
I know conceptually
what ventriloquism is,

17:46.891 --> 17:50.634
but at the time,
I just came upon this.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.723
And I could make this sound--

17:52.810 --> 17:54.508
I'll make the sound,
it might be--

17:54.595 --> 17:57.206
just warning the sound people,

17:57.293 --> 18:00.035
um, which was,
if I can still do this--

18:00.122 --> 18:02.994
Ahem, I don't do this anymore,
I should tell you, because...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.953
[high-pitch humming]

18:16.269 --> 18:18.053
So...[Pollak] What the hell?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.011
The teacher would do that

18:20.099 --> 18:23.102
and the teacher would
throw a kid out, not me.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.104
It wasn't really
even for attention,

18:25.191 --> 18:26.540
because I wasn't
getting attention,

18:26.627 --> 18:29.195
it was more for,
I guess I was--

18:29.282 --> 18:31.762
couldn't come to grips

18:31.849 --> 18:35.418
with the idea that they were
trying to teach something.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.377
I would go to
where they were

18:37.464 --> 18:41.076
with an enormous tape recorder
from the AV squad

18:41.163 --> 18:44.166
and I would lie and say
it was a real radio station.

18:44.253 --> 18:47.213
And when I got there, a child,
you know, had just shown up

18:47.300 --> 18:49.171
and they would
realize they got duped,

18:49.258 --> 18:51.565
but they would talk to me anyway
'cause they were really nice.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.523
And I would just
say to Seinfeld,

18:53.610 --> 18:55.264
"How do you write a joke?"

18:55.351 --> 18:58.093
And I would force him
to walk me through it.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.183
Or Harold Ramis--
"How do you write a movie?"

19:01.270 --> 19:04.360
And those interviews

19:04.447 --> 19:06.884
changed my life
because they really told me.

19:06.971 --> 19:10.932
It was my college,
I had my college in
junior year of high school.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.803
I was just so obsessed.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.849
So I thought,
"I'm gonna try to interview

19:14.936 --> 19:17.591
every original writer
from 'Saturday Night Live.'"

19:17.678 --> 19:20.942
So I interviewed Al Franken
and Tom Davis and--

19:21.029 --> 19:22.770
[Pollak]
You can't just call
these people up.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.946
Well, what would happen
is someone would be nice,

19:25.033 --> 19:26.948
like, Alan Zweibel.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.124
I'd interview him and then he
would take out the phone book

19:29.211 --> 19:31.344
and say, "I'm gonna
hook you up with this person."

19:31.431 --> 19:33.824
And he would start
giving me all the phone numbers

19:33.911 --> 19:35.391
and I was obsessive.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.001
I was always trying
to get Andy Kaufman,

19:37.088 --> 19:38.960
but I couldn't get him
because at the time,

19:39.047 --> 19:40.831
he was down South wrestling,

19:40.918 --> 19:42.485
and I would call his management
office and they would say,

19:42.572 --> 19:44.444
"We don't even know
where he is.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.315
He's off the--
he's off the grid."

19:46.402 --> 19:48.274
He was off the grid
before there was a grid.

19:48.361 --> 19:51.712
And then I was watching Richard
Pryor with my parents on HBO,

19:51.799 --> 19:53.757
it was "Live in Concert"
from Long Beach.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.281
And that was
when I knew, like,

19:55.368 --> 19:57.544
"Oh, that's what you do
with being funny."

19:57.631 --> 19:59.763
And I remember being amazed
that my parents and I

19:59.850 --> 20:02.375
were enjoying
the same thing so much.

20:02.462 --> 20:06.248
That's the first time
I can remember us-- me saying,
"That's what I want to do,"

20:06.335 --> 20:08.468
as far as it related
to my family.

20:08.555 --> 20:11.645
I mean, as far as
my own quirky weird shit,

20:11.732 --> 20:14.213
I mean, I've-- I've been
a little pervert my whole life.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.477
I've had that whole weird
addictive personality thing

20:17.564 --> 20:19.696
since very,
very early childhood.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.307
And being funny
was just kinda--

20:21.394 --> 20:22.656
It was also a way
to balance out

20:22.743 --> 20:24.310
people picking on you.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.659
Nobody fucked with you
if you were funny

20:25.746 --> 20:28.227
because they were scared
you'd mock them.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.881
It's the one thing I could do
to a football player that
he couldn't do to me.

20:30.968 --> 20:35.059
I started doing drugs
when I was 15.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.887
I started doing drugs heavily.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.629
So I went to rehab
when I was 16.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.328
And I got out of rehab
and, like, all my friends

20:42.415 --> 20:44.852
that I hung out
with just ignored me.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.506
They never
called me anymore.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.683
I lost my entire
friend base.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.468
So my grades were so bad

20:52.555 --> 20:54.818
that I took theater
to get an easy A.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.516
I'm like, it's the easiest
A I can take.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
So I do that.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.868
And I do a monologue

21:00.955 --> 21:03.131
that had--
that was comedic.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.829
We would put on plays
for the entire school

21:05.916 --> 21:08.528
and, uh, it was like,
super Def Jammy,

21:08.615 --> 21:11.052
so, like, people would,
like, boo and throw stuff.

21:11.139 --> 21:14.142
And we did this play
that we had written

21:14.229 --> 21:15.970
and I was one of the leads

21:16.057 --> 21:18.712
and I came out and, uh,

21:18.799 --> 21:22.498
just completely had the entire
theater just destroyed, rolling.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.892
Like, just murdered
with this character,

21:24.979 --> 21:28.156
and, like, to the point--
I mean, people, like, lost it.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.027
And my teacher was just like--

21:30.114 --> 21:31.855
I walked offstage
and she was like,

21:31.942 --> 21:35.250
"There's way more here
than you're seeing."

21:35.337 --> 21:36.860
She's like,
"You gotta, like..."

21:36.947 --> 21:38.384
So I joined an improv group

21:38.471 --> 21:40.951
and just started, like,
getting into comedy.

21:41.038 --> 21:45.042
But it kind of,
like, comedy took over for
what the drugs did for me.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.567
I just became--
was so obsessed with drugs

21:47.654 --> 21:50.396
and then that was gone
and so I just completely--

21:50.483 --> 21:52.833
completely threw
myself into comedy.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.878
You're controlling
this whole room.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.403
You're giving them--
you're like a drug dealer.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.754
You're giving them this drug
that's making them feel really
good all at once.

22:00.841 --> 22:04.148
[Norton] From the time
I was a kid and I got addicted
to people looking at me,

22:04.235 --> 22:06.499
it's like, the reason
I want to do that for work

22:06.586 --> 22:08.631
is because you get
addicted to that feeling.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.981
You get addicted
to that immediate high.

22:11.068 --> 22:14.289
I mean, that's why people
become addicted to sex
or drugs or alcohol,

22:14.376 --> 22:16.639
because it gives you what you
want or what you think you want.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.686
Um, and with this,
it's a healthy way

22:19.773 --> 22:23.777
to get love or whatever
it is that we call it.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.909
But it's a constant--
it's like an adrenaline.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.956
You know, there's nothing like
getting a laugh from people.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.654
It's a really weird,
addictive high,

22:31.741 --> 22:33.830
whether it's on a stage
or just with a--

22:33.917 --> 22:35.963
It's a weird power thing,
which--

22:36.050 --> 22:37.747
there's no other way
for me to achieve that.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.619
There's no other way
for me to feel that

22:39.706 --> 22:41.577
and nothing else
can compare to that,

22:41.664 --> 22:43.231
so what kind of job
would I do...

22:43.318 --> 22:45.842
I would go to work all day
and be miserable,

22:45.929 --> 22:48.976
'cause no job is gonna
compare to that feeling.

22:49.063 --> 22:52.806
So I think that was why I had
to keep doing it because this--

22:52.893 --> 22:54.460
I'm always chasing that feeling.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.375
[Pollak] How did that feel?Oh, it-- I'm sorry.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.246
When you finally had--Crack cocaine.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.291
Yeah.Rock-- crack-- rock cocaine--
crack cocaine.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.206
Because...Big rock cocaine.

23:02.293 --> 23:05.775
Because, um, when you're alone
and you're solo up there

23:05.862 --> 23:08.561
and you can modulate them
and you get the laughs

23:08.648 --> 23:11.346
and you can build on it
and you can go back and
forth and you can--

23:11.433 --> 23:15.394
the power of, like, calling back
something and having them--

23:15.481 --> 23:18.092
It's like you're
the one-man show

23:18.179 --> 23:21.878
and the adrenaline and blood
shoots through your head

23:21.965 --> 23:25.404
in a way that I think is
identical to--

23:25.491 --> 23:27.231
to crystal meth.[Pollak] Yeah.

23:27.318 --> 23:30.496
[Hanks]
I would do gigs,
I would do a shot

23:30.583 --> 23:33.194
at 12:30 and at 4:00
in the morning,

23:33.281 --> 23:35.414
I still can't figure out
why I'm not asleep,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.198
because it had just shot,

23:37.285 --> 23:39.113
you know, the adrenaline
shoots through you.

23:39.200 --> 23:43.509
I feel like comedy
is a drug in a weird way

23:43.596 --> 23:45.336
and I don't know what
it's a gateway to,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.643
but, doing more drugs?

23:47.730 --> 23:49.515
Hour-long specials?

23:49.602 --> 23:51.168
Hour-long drugs?

23:51.255 --> 23:53.083
What does it lead to?
A sitcom of--

23:53.170 --> 23:54.955
[Pollak]
And you want a nightly drug.A nightly thing?

23:55.042 --> 23:57.479
I mean, it is,
it really is.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.960
And it's a buzz and you go,
"I gotta get that again."

24:00.047 --> 24:02.353
I mean, you go to another
club the same night.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.094
'Cause you go,
"I did this club already."[Pollak] Yeah.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.532
I did all these drugs here.That's awesome.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.230
And now let's go to another
place where there's more drugs.That's old porn.

24:09.317 --> 24:12.189
[laughing]
That's old porn,
yeah, that's old porn.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.887
I wanna go to a place--
I need some fresh.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.889
It is a drug, you know?

24:15.976 --> 24:17.760
And the closest thing--

24:17.847 --> 24:21.460
When you have a-- when you
have a moment of-- of either

24:21.547 --> 24:23.853
hilarity or vulnerability
on stage

24:23.940 --> 24:26.247
or something that--
where you--

24:26.334 --> 24:29.032
It's the closest thing
I've ever come to,

24:29.119 --> 24:32.558
even in acting class,
of spirituality

24:32.645 --> 24:34.168
where you kind of,
like, anything--

24:34.255 --> 24:36.562
and I hate that
I'm even saying that word,

24:36.649 --> 24:38.738
but like,
of any kind of, like...

24:38.825 --> 24:41.262
[Pollak]
But it's that powerful.It is that powerful.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.004
It's the closest thing
I've had to, you know, like,
people speaking in tongues

24:44.091 --> 24:47.094
or whatever and getting--
having an enlightened feeling.

24:47.181 --> 24:51.359
Uh, when you have a moment on
stage or in film where you're--

24:51.446 --> 24:53.100
But especially on stage,

24:53.187 --> 24:55.319
where you're in front of
a live audience, where you're--

24:55.406 --> 24:57.191
[Pollak]
It's only happening
in that moment.

24:57.278 --> 25:00.586
Yeah, yeah, and it's like,
bang, and it's your--

25:00.673 --> 25:03.763
It's a feeling
of enlightenment.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.722
A feeling of freedom,
liberty, yeah.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.333
It took a big chunk of time
for me to discover it,

25:09.420 --> 25:11.640
to discover that silence

25:11.727 --> 25:14.469
is the root of all comedy.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.471
That's where it lays.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.560
Um, because, uh,

25:18.647 --> 25:22.085
all silence did
was panic me, so I--

25:22.172 --> 25:24.044
If there was silence,
it meant they weren't laughing

25:24.131 --> 25:26.786
or they were contemplating
how to kill me.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.615
I don't think
there's any bigger thrill

25:29.702 --> 25:31.573
in comedy

25:31.660 --> 25:33.357
than when knowing

25:33.444 --> 25:35.751
a big laugh's coming up
and they don't know.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.145
When you've got
that little secret

25:38.232 --> 25:40.930
where you're like, "In a second,
you're gonna be laughing."

25:41.017 --> 25:43.150
And maybe they're
uncomfortable, or maybe--

25:43.237 --> 25:47.502
I have-- I have
a routine where, uh,

25:47.589 --> 25:50.984
I took a friend of mine with
muscular dystrophy to a brothel

25:51.071 --> 25:53.203
and there's
this moment just before

25:53.290 --> 25:55.902
the woman sucks
the disabled guy off,

25:55.989 --> 25:58.034
on stage, where they're
all going, "This is horrible,"

25:58.121 --> 26:01.647
and I have a punchline that's
gonna zing, and that for me--

26:01.734 --> 26:04.737
Silence is...
sometimes when you watch--

26:04.824 --> 26:08.828
Do you ever watch,
like, movies being made
and you can tell the editing?

26:08.915 --> 26:11.308
When you can tell
jokes where you go,

26:11.395 --> 26:14.398
"That joke worked,
but you cut it off too quick."

26:14.485 --> 26:17.576
And someone who was
editing it went, "Well,
that joke's over," boom.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.142
[Favreau]
You can gauge what that--

26:19.229 --> 26:21.710
you know when the laughter
is gonna come.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.539
You get that response built-in
so that when you're in the
vacuum of an audience,

26:24.626 --> 26:28.499
you know-- you understand
timing, you understand
the fundamentals.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.460
Comedians, you know,
you have certain laugh ears,
you can hear.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.810
That's where you're
listening to the audience

26:34.897 --> 26:37.683
and that's where some,
you know, new comedians,

26:37.770 --> 26:39.989
you know, they bomb
and they come off stage

26:40.076 --> 26:41.687
and they're like,
"That was pretty good."
And you're like, "You're--"

26:41.774 --> 26:44.559
You know, they have
no laugh ears, right?

26:44.646 --> 26:47.562
I-- I just have
the approach of

26:47.649 --> 26:49.564
never give them a second.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.045
Never give them
a second to...

26:52.132 --> 26:54.700
It's like someone's
off balance.

26:54.787 --> 26:58.878
That's the best time
to hit someone, right?[Pollak laughing]

26:58.965 --> 27:00.880
They're like,
that's kind of-- Oh!

27:00.967 --> 27:04.579
We all have friends where you
sit there and you talk to them

27:04.666 --> 27:07.190
and you know
they're just thinking of
what they're gonna say.

27:07.277 --> 27:10.193
They're not even listening.
That's what comedians do.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.456
You know, you walk off stage
and you're at the bar

27:12.543 --> 27:14.937
and you're not magic anymore.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.765
And then it's almost
like when I would walk off,
like, the spell is broken

27:16.852 --> 27:19.420
and then I realize I'm a fucking
zilch and then they realize it.

27:19.507 --> 27:23.163
They like, "Oh, God,
we allowed him to control us?"
[laughing]

27:23.250 --> 27:26.079
We got involved
in a dangerous situation,

27:26.166 --> 27:28.995
you know, doing drugs and then
being-- just constantly working

27:29.082 --> 27:30.692
and not dealing with it.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.042
And the one thing
about Mitch that's weird is,

27:33.129 --> 27:35.741
um, a lot of people view comics
as, especially someone that,

27:35.828 --> 27:40.049
you know, dies tragedy, like--
tragically, like Mitch did,

27:40.136 --> 27:43.096
and, um, you know, drugs, it
comes with all these thoughts,

27:43.183 --> 27:45.489
and a lot of people think
it's someone--

27:45.576 --> 27:48.623
Something about Mitch
is he didn't really have
that kind of negative side.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.756
In a fucked up way,

27:50.843 --> 27:52.627
it was almost
was his downfall.

27:52.714 --> 27:56.457
Like, I would say, "Mitch,
we can't do this anymore."

27:56.544 --> 27:59.416
Like, and he--
like, Mitch wasn't stupid,
it wasn't fun anymore.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.941
Doing-- doing
an opiate isn't fun

28:02.028 --> 28:04.987
after it isn't fun anymore.[Pollak] Right.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.946
Who's the pumpkin chick?
Cinderella?

28:07.033 --> 28:09.165
Whichever one-- whichever one
that turned into a pumpkin,

28:09.252 --> 28:10.906
like, that's what it's like.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.953
I'm a fucking
zilch again, ugh.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.085
I would come off stage
in Hartford, Connecticut,

28:16.172 --> 28:18.435
or whatever shithole
I had done, you know,

28:18.522 --> 28:21.308
and I was just drinking
my water and I'm still
the same frightened idiot.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.485
And I'm like, "I have to
go back on to achieve that."

28:24.572 --> 28:27.793
Definitely a certain point
in my life where I was--

28:27.880 --> 28:31.448
I was-- I was
at ease most on stage

28:31.535 --> 28:33.581
in front of strangers

28:33.668 --> 28:35.365
as opposed to, uh,

28:35.452 --> 28:38.151
being with anyone I knew,
I would just--

28:38.238 --> 28:40.849
Not that I was antisocial,
I don't know, but I was just--

28:40.936 --> 28:43.069
I looked forward
to getting on stage.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.462
I was like, "That's where--
that's where I really
can be loose

28:45.549 --> 28:48.291
and have fun and, you know,
I just love doing that."

28:48.378 --> 28:51.817
I mean, now I have a talk show
where I just talk to strangers

28:51.904 --> 28:53.557
and people I haven't met.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.168
A healthy person probably
looks around and says,

28:55.255 --> 28:57.213
"It's a wonderful world
full of wonderful things."

28:57.300 --> 28:59.433
And a non-healthy person says,

28:59.520 --> 29:01.609
"I want people to think
I'm one of the wonderful things.

29:03.437 --> 29:06.309
"I want people to be glad
that I live on Earth.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.486
I need to hear it."

29:09.573 --> 29:11.619
Rather than just think,

29:11.706 --> 29:13.490
"Oh, isn't it wonderful

29:13.577 --> 29:16.972
to have people like
that who exist to entertain me?"

29:17.059 --> 29:19.714
You go to a place of,
I gotta--

29:19.801 --> 29:21.629
How do I become that person?

29:21.716 --> 29:25.459
That someone else will feel
that way about me, you know?

29:25.546 --> 29:27.635
That's...

29:27.722 --> 29:29.811
that's what I guess separates

29:29.898 --> 29:32.727
healthy people
from non-healthy people.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.382
There's a protective element,

29:35.469 --> 29:37.645
I think, that we all kind of
share with one another,

29:37.732 --> 29:41.040
because no one knows
but us what we go through.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.826
The insecurity and the,
you know, the childishness,

29:44.913 --> 29:47.307
the-- the gaping hole

29:47.394 --> 29:50.353
that can only be filled
with the love of strangers
laughter every 15 to 30 seconds.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.879
That is something that unless
you do it, you don't know.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.055
No manager knows it,

29:56.142 --> 29:58.535
even if they're a real
astute, empathetic manager,

29:58.622 --> 30:01.756
and there are such people,
no agent knows it.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.845
I do this every night.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.368
Every night, 300--

30:05.455 --> 30:07.631
I work, you know,
250, 300 nights a year,

30:07.718 --> 30:09.895
and so don't tell me.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.897
It's failure.[Pollak] Yeah.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.334
I think, it's failure
is what it is.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.075
And-- and the whole thing,

30:16.162 --> 30:19.513
all these 27 years of me
doing stand-up have been a fluke

30:19.600 --> 30:21.863
and today's the day
that they all figure it out

30:21.950 --> 30:24.866
and you walk out there and it's
the first time you've ever--

30:24.953 --> 30:26.650
And you're never funny again.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.783
[Lisa Kudrow] Well, I think
everyone can be funny,

30:28.870 --> 30:31.917
but not when they want,
you know?

30:32.004 --> 30:33.875
That's sort of the trick.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.269
Sometimes when people
want to be funny

30:36.356 --> 30:39.315
and they try,
it's a little painful.

30:39.402 --> 30:42.405
But...[Pollak] But the fact
that they can try,

30:42.492 --> 30:44.451
that's the thing that
to me that dilutes it,

30:44.538 --> 30:47.497
because when you're at a party,
nobody dabbles in dentistry.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.282
[laughing]

30:49.369 --> 30:51.937
But everyone can, if they want,
choose to dabble in comedy.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.590
They can be horrible.Right.

30:53.677 --> 30:56.289
But they can at least do it.That's true.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.465
That annoys the hell out of me.That's true.

30:58.552 --> 31:02.077
[laughing] Well, I meant,
I think everyone's capable

31:02.164 --> 31:04.210
of-- of being funny

31:04.297 --> 31:06.952
at some point or another,
you know?

31:07.039 --> 31:09.302
I think-- And I--

31:09.389 --> 31:11.652
Definitely,
I think every actor

31:11.739 --> 31:14.655
is capable of being funny,
I really do.

31:14.742 --> 31:17.876
The first person
from my real life that
made me laugh really hard?

31:17.963 --> 31:20.574
Dan Rather, I guess,

31:20.661 --> 31:22.663
is the first guy

31:22.750 --> 31:26.232
who really made me
sort of have that--

31:26.319 --> 31:28.538
that I-think-
I'm-gonna-throw-up laugh,

31:28.625 --> 31:31.324
when he switched
from suits to sweaters.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.239
When I did stand-up,
I always thought,

31:33.326 --> 31:35.371
"I'm just some fucking idiot.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.287
Why would you sit and listen
to me talk for 20 minutes?"

31:38.374 --> 31:39.985
I didn't have that confidence

31:40.072 --> 31:42.335
that I could do some great
George Carlin monologue

31:42.422 --> 31:44.772
that would inspire people.

31:44.859 --> 31:46.208
And it took me another decade

31:46.295 --> 31:48.994
to feel that in my movies

31:49.081 --> 31:50.560
I could open up my heart

31:50.647 --> 31:53.041
and tell people what
I felt about being alive

31:53.128 --> 31:56.610
and that it was
worthy of being told.

31:56.697 --> 31:59.308
And the moment I realized
that I can open up

31:59.395 --> 32:02.572
and that it is okay to share
my way of looking at the world

32:02.659 --> 32:05.358
with other people,
then my career took off.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.143
I got to see Richard Jeni.You know, I always loved
Peter Sellers.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.145
An early,
early Peter Sellers.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.755
You know,
or even Phyllis Diller.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.888
Like, those kind of
threw me more than...

32:13.975 --> 32:17.848
Stephen Wright.Who gets on and is
so quiet and withdrawn.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.373
Dennis Miller's second special,
"Black and White."

32:20.460 --> 32:21.896
Bill Cosby and whatnot.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.376
And watching that master,

32:23.463 --> 32:25.030
watching Johnny Carson
and seeing...

32:25.117 --> 32:26.379
The Woody Allen movies,

32:26.466 --> 32:28.598
and then
the Steve Martin specials.

32:28.685 --> 32:31.427
Steve Martin.I wanted to be...

32:31.514 --> 32:34.561
The greatest stand-up with
the most weapons in history.

32:34.648 --> 32:38.652
'Cause I thought then
I could be the right kind of
Lenny Bruce funny.

32:38.739 --> 32:42.525
And that's something
that Adam Sandler, like,
really ingrained in me.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.137
[Coogan]
I saw "Spinal Tap," went,
"Who are these guys?

32:45.224 --> 32:48.444
How come they're, like,
making fun of us in a way
that's really accurate?"

32:48.531 --> 32:50.272
And I went in doing
Alan Partridge,

32:50.359 --> 32:53.710
there's a bit in it where
I steal from Michael McKean.

32:53.797 --> 32:56.104
There's a scene where I say
something like...

32:56.191 --> 32:59.238
"Who... do you think you are?"

32:59.325 --> 33:02.067
And while I'm saying this,
there's a scene where
Michael McKean--

33:02.154 --> 33:03.982
when Christopher Guest
comes in,

33:04.069 --> 33:05.896
he says, "I've come to re-plug
your life support machine.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.465
"I've come to--
We can re-- do a tour of Japan."

33:09.552 --> 33:11.946
Our single, "Sex Farm,"
was a big hit in Japan.

33:12.033 --> 33:15.732
And he goes,
"Oh, so you've come to re-plug
our life support systems?

33:15.819 --> 33:18.083
"The...

33:18.170 --> 33:20.607
fucking nerve you display."

33:20.694 --> 33:24.611
And-- and I--
I use that sometimes.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.962
When we first started
making "The Office,"

33:28.049 --> 33:32.097
uh, I was walking down
the street with Ricky Gervais,

33:32.184 --> 33:34.795
and Steve Coogan
was coming the other way

33:34.882 --> 33:38.103
and I was very excited and
kind of-- but slightly daunted.

33:38.190 --> 33:42.063
Like, "Ahh,"
and I have this weird thing

33:42.150 --> 33:43.978
when I meet people I admire

33:44.065 --> 33:47.416
that I don't want to seem
like a fawning idiot, you know?

33:47.503 --> 33:49.331
Like, I want to seem,
kind of--

33:49.418 --> 33:51.029
I don't want
to give them, like--

33:51.116 --> 33:53.248
Be effusive and going on
about how great they are.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.903
I feel like that
just will seem vulgar

33:55.990 --> 33:59.863
or kind of ass-kissy
or something, you know?

33:59.950 --> 34:01.648
And so I had this kind of,

34:01.735 --> 34:03.737
this thing, which is to
sort of be slightly, kind of,

34:03.824 --> 34:06.653
a little bit cheeky, like,
we're comedians, you know?

34:06.740 --> 34:09.177
You know, I'll have
a little dig at you and
you have a little dig at me,

34:09.264 --> 34:11.092
but it's all done
with good humor.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.833
And Coogan comes out and he-- he
introduces himself to both of us

34:13.920 --> 34:15.618
and he's very sweet
and he says, "Oh, I--

34:15.705 --> 34:17.620
I've seen your show
'The Office' and I'm a big fan."

34:17.706 --> 34:20.145
And then he said,
"If my career is ever
on the skids,

34:20.232 --> 34:22.495
I'd love for you to
write something for me."

34:22.581 --> 34:25.193
And my mouth-- I just went,
"Well, you'd better get
in touch now, then."

34:25.280 --> 34:27.282
[Pollak laughing]

34:27.369 --> 34:29.502
But, like,
for no reason, like...

34:29.589 --> 34:33.027
His career was going
from strength to strength,

34:33.114 --> 34:35.551
it was-- like, it was just--

34:35.638 --> 34:37.379
What?

34:37.466 --> 34:39.947
And he sort of went--
He kind of-- "Eh?"

34:40.034 --> 34:43.516
And he sort of was--
And Ricky just looked at me,
like, that's a weird--

34:43.603 --> 34:45.866
And I would--
No, I just-- no--

34:45.953 --> 34:49.217
"Obviously, you don't--
your career is going so good
that you don't--

34:49.304 --> 34:51.132
"It's ironic,
I'm saying, you don't--

34:51.219 --> 34:53.178
"It was absurd. You don't need
to get in touch, 'cause--"

34:53.264 --> 34:55.092
And I just--
I think he went, "Right."

34:55.179 --> 34:57.617
And they kind of tried to have a
conversation for a little while

34:57.704 --> 35:00.185
and then, he went,
"Sorry, I-- sorry,
what did you mean?"

35:00.272 --> 35:01.925
And I went,
"I'm sorry, I--

35:02.012 --> 35:05.190
"What I meant was,
your career is clearly great,

35:05.277 --> 35:06.713
so you don't need to
get in touch with us."

35:06.800 --> 35:08.193
"But why would you say that?"

35:08.280 --> 35:09.455
"No, but that-- yeah."

35:09.542 --> 35:10.804
And it just--
and it kind of--

35:10.891 --> 35:12.240
it just fizzled out,
you know,

35:12.327 --> 35:16.418
and we just went off
into the day.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.508
And I don't-- I've never
really been able to, you know,

35:19.595 --> 35:22.381
never had the opportunity
to sort of explain myself
or apologize to him.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.210
He must have just thought,
"What a dick."

35:25.297 --> 35:26.907
I'd like to be able
to try and make a point

35:26.994 --> 35:28.865
and then still be able
to tell a joke

35:28.952 --> 35:31.651
about fucking getting shit on
you dick or whatever, right?

35:31.738 --> 35:34.523
And I love that Carlin
can say something so precise

35:34.610 --> 35:36.438
and so well and then,

35:36.525 --> 35:38.788
"Now I'm gonna talk about
farts for five minutes."

35:38.875 --> 35:42.096
He had the same hard line
when it came to farting,

35:42.183 --> 35:44.925
if that makes sense.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.579
But as I said,

35:46.666 --> 35:49.886
I only became
a huge fan of Carlin

35:49.973 --> 35:52.585
when I realized how hard it was
to be really good at this.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.500
Groucho, Groucho,
Groucho, Groucho.

35:54.587 --> 35:58.765
Not so many people talked Zeppo
or Chico, but I loved Harpo.

35:58.852 --> 36:02.769
I loved-- Because Harpo,
to me, was insane,

36:02.856 --> 36:04.945
and there was
an unpredictable nature.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.861
He'd just, you know,
be cross-examining
the passport guy

36:07.948 --> 36:10.255
and he'd just jump on
the thing and start, you know,

36:10.342 --> 36:12.431
doing the pens
like it was a plane,

36:12.518 --> 36:14.389
and then start chasing women.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.262
And I thought, this guy,
because I don't know,

36:17.349 --> 36:20.439
literally, there's no way I can
look away for five seconds

36:20.526 --> 36:22.832
because I'll miss
some transition.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.618
[Penn Jillette]
Lenny Bruce decides

36:25.705 --> 36:29.796
that that kind of
philosophical honest speech

36:29.883 --> 36:32.625
is gonna be called
stand-up comedy.

36:32.712 --> 36:36.106
And right from that moment,
you've created Pryor and Carlin.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.326
We don't know who
they're gonna be, you know,

36:38.413 --> 36:40.328
but they have to happen.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.939
[Hanks]
I remember seeing
Richard Pryor

36:43.026 --> 36:46.073
on an "Ed Sullivan Show."[Pollak] Yep.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.683
In which the routine was about

36:47.770 --> 36:49.859
the toughest kid in school.

36:49.946 --> 36:52.906
And for no reason at all,
the toughest kid in school

36:52.993 --> 36:56.823
would like point at ya
and say, "You, after school,

36:56.910 --> 36:58.477
I'm gonna bite
your foot off."

36:58.564 --> 37:01.131
[Pollak laughing]

37:01.219 --> 37:03.308
And you'd have to believe him
because he'd be walking around

37:03.395 --> 37:05.266
with a big shoe
hanging out of his mouth.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.094
I mean, that was
his routine for the--

37:07.181 --> 37:09.401
for "The Ed Sullivan Show."[Pollak] Ed Sullivan. Yeah.

37:09.488 --> 37:12.621
The actual routine was,
"You, after school,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.971
I'm gonna bite
your dick off."

37:15.058 --> 37:16.625
And you had to believe it
because he walked around
with a dick hanging--

37:16.712 --> 37:19.454
I mean, no, it was pretty funny
when you realized that.

37:19.541 --> 37:24.372
I mean, my favorite
is Richard going to Africa

37:24.459 --> 37:27.027
and sitting-- [chuckles]

37:27.114 --> 37:30.813
sitting in the coach
with the African guy,

37:30.900 --> 37:33.816
and he says, you know,
"The man smell,"

37:33.903 --> 37:36.384
and he does this thing and it
was like-- [exhales sharply]

37:36.471 --> 37:38.908
And this whole--
and it was like,

37:38.995 --> 37:41.911
"Oh, I'm watching the smell,
I can see it."

37:41.998 --> 37:45.698
But then he says,
"And then I looked at him,

37:45.785 --> 37:49.136
and he was like...
You stink, too."

37:49.223 --> 37:50.746
And I thought, "Oh!"

37:50.833 --> 37:52.313
Okay!

37:52.400 --> 37:54.489
And I understood.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.666
[James L. Brooks]
Richie Pryor, who had
a big acting career,

37:57.753 --> 38:00.713
did his greatest acting
in his stand-up,

38:00.800 --> 38:03.193
where he would break your heart
and involve you in story.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.544
I mean, you know, and you could
see it in his concert films.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.373
Extraordinary,
realistic acting.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.810
And with movies, it was--

38:10.897 --> 38:14.292
He just didn't give it
that kind of dimension
that he did to his stand-up.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.337
[Prinze, Jr.]
Richard was in love
with Pam Grier,

38:16.424 --> 38:18.513
okay, like every guy
was in the '70s.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.776
And he got his hands
on an old tape

38:20.863 --> 38:23.126
of some of my dad's stuff
that wasn't so funny,

38:23.213 --> 38:25.085
that wasn't that good.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.000
They sit down and Richard says,
"Oh, I got some stuff, I got--

38:27.087 --> 38:29.089
Y'all gotta hear this,
this is some great shit."

38:29.176 --> 38:31.004
And he starts playing
some of my dad's old material

38:31.091 --> 38:32.788
and my dad's
getting hot, right?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.224
He's kind of
shitting all over him,

38:34.312 --> 38:35.661
my dad finally
just says, "Fuck this!"

38:35.748 --> 38:37.837
And he gets up
and he lays out Richard,

38:37.924 --> 38:40.796
takes both girls,
and splits.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.755
Now, I'm not lying.
I didn't make this story up.

38:42.842 --> 38:45.758
This story was told to me
by-- by "Growing Pains,"

38:45.845 --> 38:47.325
by Joanna Kearns, man.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.935
Like, I'm sitting
in the trailer

38:49.022 --> 38:50.763
and about right near
the end of the story,

38:50.850 --> 38:52.504
I think she realizes,

38:52.591 --> 38:54.157
"Oh, shit, he was married
and this is his son,"

38:54.244 --> 38:56.421
and, like, goes into
this reserved, kind of--

38:56.508 --> 38:58.336
But he was-- he was
a very sweet man.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.425
The news came on and they said
that Freddie Prinze

39:00.512 --> 39:01.904
had just killed himself.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.777
A comic could make
so much of a big--

39:04.864 --> 39:06.735
make a big splash
in this world, you know,

39:06.822 --> 39:08.911
and so many people
are affected

39:08.998 --> 39:11.131
by somebody
who makes them laugh.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.524
It's an important job.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.134
And for some reason,
his passing

39:14.221 --> 39:16.789
was the thing that
sent me out to L.A.

39:16.876 --> 39:18.617
I was in Rochester, New York.

39:18.704 --> 39:21.141
I was an absolutely
nobody, part-timer,

39:21.228 --> 39:24.187
just jack of all trades, would
do whatever the radio station

39:24.274 --> 39:27.974
asked of me and one day,
Sam Kinison walked in.

39:28.061 --> 39:30.846
The mic went on
and he just spoke his mind

39:30.933 --> 39:33.806
and he was outrageous,
he was funny.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.678
Uh, he was sensitive at times

39:36.765 --> 39:39.464
and a lightbulb
went off in my head

39:39.551 --> 39:42.031
where I realized, "Oh, my God,
I could do this different.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.251
Just you gotta
just be yourself.

39:44.338 --> 39:47.863
And, uh, and just--
I started blowing off all--

39:47.950 --> 39:50.605
Everything I knew about
radio after that day.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.825
I think the only vision
I had of it,

39:52.912 --> 39:54.696
and many people
I believe say this,

39:54.783 --> 39:56.829
is of "The Dick Van Dyke Show"

39:56.916 --> 39:58.918
and the writer's room

39:59.005 --> 40:02.791
of Buddy and Sally,
and, um,

40:02.878 --> 40:05.838
uh, Rob Petrie
thinking of ideas.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.970
[Alan Zweibel]
I used to sit home
and I used to watch it.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.320
And I look at this
guy Rob Petrie,

40:10.408 --> 40:13.541
and, you know, he was married
to Mary Tyler Moore,

40:13.628 --> 40:16.849
he had a very nice house
up in New Rochelle,

40:16.936 --> 40:18.633
he had a kid named Ritchie,

40:18.720 --> 40:21.201
and he spent his days
at work lying on a couch,

40:21.288 --> 40:23.856
just, you know, joking around
with Buddy and Sally

40:23.943 --> 40:26.162
and I went,
"I think I want to do that."

40:26.249 --> 40:29.470
I feel like I had a vision of,
"Oh, I'll write."

40:29.557 --> 40:33.213
Somehow I'll get in a office,
but I think it was more

40:33.300 --> 40:35.041
I just want to be around

40:35.128 --> 40:39.045
people who do comedy
or say funny things.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.787
As a got older, when Letterman
came on in high school,

40:41.874 --> 40:44.093
then I had an idea,
I would like to write

40:44.180 --> 40:46.400
for the Letterman show
and live in New York,

40:46.487 --> 40:49.621
but it's not like I had a talent
for it, you know what I mean?

40:49.708 --> 40:53.842
[coughs]
Excuse me, I have tuberculosis.

40:53.929 --> 40:57.106
Um, I don't think it's
contagious, Kevin Pollak,

40:57.193 --> 40:59.326
who is not
sitting here with me.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.722
Kevin Pollak,
Kevin Pollak.
I think it is.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.637
No, it might be.Contagious.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.595
I might have to
take the waters.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.728
[Pollak laughing]

41:09.815 --> 41:11.599
It took me three years

41:11.686 --> 41:13.906
to get on stage
for the first time.

41:13.993 --> 41:16.909
Because-- and the reason why
I finally got on stage

41:16.996 --> 41:19.738
was that there
was a contest.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.522
It's always a contest.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.393
So the prize was, um,

41:23.481 --> 41:25.134
a check for $200

41:25.221 --> 41:28.268
and the opportunity to
perform at the DC Improv.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.965
[Jake Johannsen]
Then thing that I worried about

41:30.052 --> 41:31.924
when I first started
doing stand-up

41:32.011 --> 41:35.231
was whether or not
I was crazy enough

41:35.318 --> 41:38.583
to be a comedian, you know,
because I didn't really

41:38.670 --> 41:41.499
understand what
being a stand-up--

41:41.586 --> 41:43.936
I mean, I was doing sets
in comedy clubs

41:44.023 --> 41:46.416
for almost a year
before I realized,

41:46.504 --> 41:49.245
there's guys who you haven't
even heard of who don't
have a day job

41:49.332 --> 41:51.596
who are just doing
comedy clubs, you know?

41:51.683 --> 41:54.163
I didn't know that that was
a thing that could happen.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.949
I thought,
"I'm going to the club
where Robin Williams started

41:57.036 --> 41:59.168
"and someone's gonna
see me like they saw him

41:59.255 --> 42:01.606
and then I'm gonna be
in a TV show."

42:01.693 --> 42:02.955
That's what I thought
was gonna happen.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.783
And I said
to the club manager,

42:04.870 --> 42:07.612
I said, "I want to do this
again, when can I do it?"

42:07.699 --> 42:10.615
And they handed me a mop
and they said,

42:10.702 --> 42:12.965
"Well, there's
no spots available,

42:13.052 --> 42:16.359
"but, uh, but if you, you know,
if you run food to tables

42:16.446 --> 42:19.493
"and sell tickets and things
like that, then we'll,

42:19.580 --> 42:22.714
you know, we'll keep you in mind
for fallouts and cancelations."

42:22.801 --> 42:27.022
And so I kicked around
the DC Improv for about
three or four years

42:27.109 --> 42:30.112
and eventually I was opening
for people like Brian Regan

42:30.199 --> 42:31.897
and Jake Johannsen
and Mitch Hedberg,

42:31.984 --> 42:33.507
these incredible comics

42:33.594 --> 42:35.683
who taught me

42:35.770 --> 42:38.338
everything about comedy.

42:38.425 --> 42:40.819
It's about immersion,
it's about living--

42:40.906 --> 42:43.299
Like, when I worked at
the DC Improv, I was there
all the time.

42:43.386 --> 42:45.867
I was there the nights I worked,
I was there the nights
I didn't work.

42:45.954 --> 42:47.390
I would--
I went to every show,

42:47.477 --> 42:50.132
I saw comedians
who were nothing like me.

42:50.219 --> 42:54.180
I-- I saw Larry the Cable Guy
and Rodney Carrington.

42:54.267 --> 42:57.052
People who you think you have
nothing in common with,

42:57.139 --> 43:00.752
but really, comedians
have everything in common.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.928
Cab driver, paralegal,
private chauffeur,

43:03.015 --> 43:05.321
you know, stuff like that,
and I'm lost.

43:05.408 --> 43:08.411
I'm a lost soul, you know?[Pollak] In New York.

43:08.498 --> 43:10.022
Yes, a lost soul.

43:10.109 --> 43:12.154
Parents beside themselves.

43:12.241 --> 43:13.852
"What are we gonna do?"Yes.

43:13.939 --> 43:15.723
Went to university.I would overhear conversations

43:15.810 --> 43:18.204
that were heartbreaking,
you know, terrible.

43:18.291 --> 43:20.119
About you?Yeah, about me, yeah.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.774
"Oh!" you know,
"What are we gonna
do," you know?

43:22.861 --> 43:25.124
[laughing]"What's he gonna do
with himself?"

43:25.211 --> 43:27.909
They sent me to
a psychiatrist, you know?Sure.

43:27.996 --> 43:31.696
And, um, so I take
the subway

43:31.783 --> 43:33.306
to Brooklyn to
the psychiatrist

43:33.393 --> 43:35.525
and, you know, what--

43:35.613 --> 43:38.528
what are you-- You can't
do anything for me.No.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.879
So, um, then I--
then--

43:40.966 --> 43:43.708
I don't know how or why
I thought of this,

43:43.795 --> 43:46.058
but I decided to
take an acting class.

43:46.145 --> 43:49.061
When I saw Bob Odenkirk and
David Cross for the first time,

43:49.148 --> 43:51.585
I was like, "Oh, they're
doing what I could do.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.674
"That's my sense of humor

43:53.761 --> 43:56.895
and they're making a living
at it, maybe I could do this."

43:56.982 --> 43:58.897
I always assumed no one--
Because I--

43:58.984 --> 44:02.596
Look, I grew up
as a terrible nerd

44:02.683 --> 44:06.644
who was considered
to be ugly

44:06.731 --> 44:08.776
and undateable,

44:08.863 --> 44:12.040
so...[Pollak] Chapter one.

44:12.127 --> 44:15.740
So to-- so I used humor,

44:15.827 --> 44:17.829
but when you are
ugly and undateable,

44:17.916 --> 44:20.048
the thing that
people say to you

44:20.135 --> 44:22.529
when you're trying to be funny
is, "Stop trying to be funny.

44:22.616 --> 44:24.052
You're not funny."

44:24.139 --> 44:27.577
At 25,
I saw other comedians

44:27.665 --> 44:30.276
doing the stuff that
I thought I was funny at,

44:30.363 --> 44:33.279
so I did it,
and within a week

44:33.366 --> 44:36.456
of performing comedy
for the first time,

44:36.543 --> 44:38.371
I now was a comedian.

44:38.458 --> 44:40.678
And I told people,
"I'm a comedian,"
and people went,

44:40.765 --> 44:43.768
"Oh, that's why you act the way
you act. Oh, you're funny."

44:43.855 --> 44:46.771
We do come from
the misfit island of toys,

44:46.858 --> 44:50.470
so we should be kind of
weird looking.

44:50.557 --> 44:52.472
I try and communicate
that to my children.

44:52.559 --> 44:55.301
I'm like, "There's nothing
wrong with being weird."

44:55.388 --> 44:58.130
Um, you know,
it's a very strange--

44:58.217 --> 45:00.959
'Cause I wish someone
would have told me that.

45:01.046 --> 45:03.744
'Cause I feel like
that's something culturally

45:03.831 --> 45:06.138
that we kind of toss around

45:06.225 --> 45:08.444
but really,
being different is good.

45:08.531 --> 45:11.273
Um, so I guess, uh,

45:11.360 --> 45:13.275
yeah, when I...

45:13.362 --> 45:15.277
And I know this has been
talked about before

45:15.364 --> 45:17.323
and it's a lot more
open in society,

45:17.410 --> 45:19.891
I know Jonathan Winters
talked about it in the '60s,

45:19.978 --> 45:22.807
um, but, uh,

45:22.894 --> 45:25.026
being in a psych ward,
like, I--

45:25.113 --> 45:26.898
That was just--

45:26.985 --> 45:30.684
To talk about that, like,
that was, like, really, uh,

45:30.771 --> 45:32.425
I felt very ashamed of that.

45:32.512 --> 45:35.080
And then to now,
you know, in stand-up,

45:35.167 --> 45:38.518
you say it the first time
and it's like your voice is
kind of shaking,

45:38.605 --> 45:39.911
you know?[Pollak]
Yeah.

45:39.998 --> 45:42.957
And then, like,
10 times in, it's like,

45:43.044 --> 45:45.438
"Oh, so you're in
the psych ward, as you do,"

45:45.525 --> 45:48.876
and you get so much
more relaxed about it.

45:48.963 --> 45:52.271
And then finally, it's like, you
can talk about it with anybody.Yeah.

45:52.358 --> 45:56.318
And that has been
a real gift to me, to--

45:56.405 --> 45:58.277
that the art form
allows us,

45:58.364 --> 46:00.583
like, you can talk
about anything.

46:00.670 --> 46:02.368
"I'd like to go on."

46:02.455 --> 46:04.500
On a Saturday night.On a Saturday night.

46:04.587 --> 46:05.719
He said, "Who are you?"

46:05.806 --> 46:06.851
I said, "I'm just--

46:06.938 --> 46:09.201
I'm in the audience."

46:09.288 --> 46:11.203
He said, "Have you ever
done comedy before?"

46:11.290 --> 46:13.118
I said-- I said, "No."

46:13.205 --> 46:15.729
He said,
"No, you can't go on."

46:15.816 --> 46:17.557
[both laughing]

46:17.644 --> 46:19.864
He said, "You have
to audition," you know?Yeah.

46:19.951 --> 46:22.954
I don't think I got into it
because I was essentially
narcissistic

46:23.041 --> 46:24.956
or even that I was
looking for love.

46:25.043 --> 46:27.132
Like, I feel like
I got into stand-up

46:27.219 --> 46:29.047
because, you know,
I needed to be seen.

46:29.134 --> 46:31.223
And I-- and I thought that,
like, that stage,

46:31.310 --> 46:33.225
I can do whatever I want,
whatever I want.

46:33.312 --> 46:36.054
The only context is,
you should get laughs.
Should.

46:36.141 --> 46:38.404
That's even conditional
depending on how much
you're being paid

46:38.491 --> 46:40.319
and if you're not
being paid at all,
you can do whatever you want.

46:40.406 --> 46:41.886
You can yell,
you can spit,

46:41.973 --> 46:43.801
you can tell people
to fuck themselves.

46:43.888 --> 46:47.021
It's great, you can do that
publicly, yell in front of--

46:47.108 --> 46:49.415
But I think that,
like, for me,

46:49.502 --> 46:52.722
it was just a matter of,
like, you know, I felt that
I had something to say

46:52.810 --> 46:55.682
and I thought that comedy,
for me, when I watched it
when I was a kid,

46:55.769 --> 46:57.597
I was like, these guys
have a handle on things.

46:57.684 --> 47:00.469
They can take life
and just turn a few phrases

47:00.556 --> 47:02.994
and, like, they got a handle
on it and you learn things,

47:03.081 --> 47:05.910
you see things in
a different way and they
seem to be, you know,

47:05.997 --> 47:08.303
in control
of this horrendous

47:08.390 --> 47:10.610
you know,
hurricane of bullshit

47:10.697 --> 47:13.569
that comes at us every day
and I think that's what
appealed to me,

47:13.656 --> 47:17.660
is like, how can I get a voice
that somehow can manage life

47:17.747 --> 47:20.141
and-- and be seen,

47:20.228 --> 47:23.623
kind of like, "I exist
and I have things to say."

47:23.710 --> 47:26.887
It's easily

47:26.974 --> 47:28.802
the single craziest thing

47:28.889 --> 47:30.586
that I have ever done
in my life.

47:30.673 --> 47:33.938
[Pollak] Was...Going up to Bud,
asking him to go on.

47:34.025 --> 47:35.461
Thank God he said no.

47:35.548 --> 47:37.202
You have to
nourish a delusion,

47:37.289 --> 47:40.118
uh, you know, to sort of
you know, make your way--

47:40.205 --> 47:41.946
to keep pushing
in show business.

47:42.033 --> 47:43.512
You really have to
nourish your delusion.

47:43.599 --> 47:45.732
And what's frightening,
I think, sometimes,

47:45.819 --> 47:47.952
is that, you know,
people don't know when to stop,

47:48.039 --> 47:49.388
you know what I mean?

47:49.475 --> 47:51.433
It's like...

47:51.520 --> 47:54.436
[Pollak] Comedy intervention.Yeah, but does
that really exist?

47:54.523 --> 47:56.308
And what-- how can you break
somebody's heart, you know?

47:56.395 --> 47:58.484
Their heart's gonna break
on their own or it's not.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.355
Here's the evolution of it,
I think.

48:00.442 --> 48:03.097
It's first,
I want you to like me.

48:03.184 --> 48:05.665
Then I want you to tell me
that I'm normal.

48:05.752 --> 48:10.148
And then, "Listen, can I tell
you guys about this thing
that happened to me?"

48:10.235 --> 48:13.151
And the relief of,

48:13.238 --> 48:16.806
"Yeah, I totally get
what you're saying."

48:16.894 --> 48:18.765
That's happened to me, too.

48:18.852 --> 48:21.637
And I think the older you get,
the more mature you become,

48:21.724 --> 48:25.032
the more you really feel
that connection.

48:25.119 --> 48:28.775
Even if they're just
sitting there in silence
during the setup,

48:28.862 --> 48:30.951
you really feel

48:31.038 --> 48:32.822
that we are just talking here

48:32.910 --> 48:34.694
and we understand each other.

48:34.781 --> 48:37.523
And it's not so much
about me being understood,

48:37.610 --> 48:40.874
it's about
we understand each other.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.876
I...

48:42.963 --> 48:44.878
This is a horrible thing,

48:44.965 --> 48:47.098
but my dog, um,

48:47.185 --> 48:50.492
died from a thing
that I did.

48:50.579 --> 48:53.365
Like, I removed a ramp from
the backyard to the front yard

48:53.452 --> 48:55.671
and I forgot to put it back
and she extreme sports'd it

48:55.758 --> 48:57.847
three-and-a-half feet
to her death.

48:57.935 --> 49:01.373
And I felt terrible
about that and I do
a whole shtick about it.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.723
But the great thing is,
like, after shows,

49:03.810 --> 49:06.813
people would be like,
"I sat on my rabbit!"

49:06.900 --> 49:09.642
Like, you're, like...

49:09.729 --> 49:13.037
"I squeezed
my hamster too hard.

49:13.124 --> 49:14.560
I thought I was hugging it."

49:14.647 --> 49:16.736
"Oh, yeah, okay,
right, right, like..."

49:16.823 --> 49:20.044
[Pollak]
You become a safe haven.Yeah, yeah.

49:20.131 --> 49:22.176
Like, uh, just--

49:22.263 --> 49:26.528
Like, it doesn't
become this private,
horrible, horrible thing.

49:26.615 --> 49:29.575
And it took me years
to really understand
that's what you're doing.

49:29.662 --> 49:31.229
You know, the desire
to control an audience.

49:31.316 --> 49:32.970
Or is it a desire to connect?

49:33.057 --> 49:36.408
Is it a desire to say,
"Hey, we're all together,

49:36.495 --> 49:38.192
"I'm part of you,
I got in there,

49:38.279 --> 49:40.716
we have a recognition,
we know each other."

49:40.803 --> 49:44.372
And thereby, I go,
"Okay, I do know who I am."

49:44.459 --> 49:46.026
There's two kinds of laughs.

49:46.113 --> 49:47.593
There's the kind of laugh
you get when you--

49:47.680 --> 49:50.030
you do a good gag
and do it well

49:50.117 --> 49:51.466
and the audience laugh.

49:51.553 --> 49:53.033
And then there's
the other gag.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.774
The other kind of
joke you do,

49:54.861 --> 49:56.906
when you say something
which reveals a truth

49:56.994 --> 49:59.474
about the way men behave
or the way women behave

49:59.561 --> 50:02.521
or something that everyone in
the room acknowledges is true,

50:02.608 --> 50:04.479
all at the same time,
and they laugh,

50:04.566 --> 50:06.090
and their laugh is
a laugh of recognition.

50:06.177 --> 50:08.657
And that kind of laugh
comes from the gut,

50:08.744 --> 50:10.485
because they're laughing
'cause they go,

50:10.572 --> 50:12.313
you've just shone a light
on what it is to be human.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.533
You could, you know,
walk into a notes session

50:14.620 --> 50:17.362
and you could threaten
to walk off a movie

50:17.449 --> 50:19.886
if you change
one frame of that gag

50:19.973 --> 50:22.889
'cause I am sure that this works
and I will not change it.

50:22.976 --> 50:24.456
It ruins the character, if--

50:24.543 --> 50:26.153
You don't understand
what movie we're making.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.634
This is something that's
important to me and I am--

50:28.721 --> 50:30.810
This is-- I will
go to the mat on this one.

50:30.897 --> 50:32.986
You show it to an audience,
if it doesn't get a laugh,

50:33.073 --> 50:34.988
you're back in
the editing room, "Okay,
let's blow this thing up."

50:35.075 --> 50:36.207
What do we do here?
Let's recut it.

50:36.294 --> 50:37.817
Anybody have any ideas?

50:37.904 --> 50:39.471
And that's, I guess,
our greatest success,

50:39.558 --> 50:41.734
is creating that image
in their brain.

50:41.821 --> 50:43.910
If it's a story piece

50:43.997 --> 50:45.651
and they can see it,
hear it,

50:45.738 --> 50:48.001
taste it, smell it,
and then, boom.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.176
The fireworks go off.

50:49.263 --> 50:50.656
Every comedian will tell you

50:50.743 --> 50:53.441
the most entertaining
show to watch

50:53.528 --> 50:55.748
is your good friend
who you know

50:55.835 --> 51:00.100
is really funny,
on stage, struggling.

51:00.187 --> 51:03.321
Bombing so hard, but I had to
keep doing the impression

51:03.408 --> 51:05.366
and I'm talking like Cliff--

51:05.453 --> 51:06.933
[impersonating Cliff Clavin]
Hey, there, Normy.

51:07.020 --> 51:10.110
[muttering]
You know, the actual fact--

51:10.197 --> 51:13.070
And I was looking,
Jon Stewart was in the crowd
and he was going...

51:15.246 --> 51:17.683
He was going...
Like...

51:17.770 --> 51:20.468
There's a show where I've never
bombed so badly in my life.

51:20.555 --> 51:23.906
I went on
and I fucking tanked.

51:23.993 --> 51:25.517
I was a Saturday night.

51:25.604 --> 51:27.388
I did two shows
and the audience stared at me

51:27.475 --> 51:29.129
and it was a living hell.

51:29.216 --> 51:31.044
It was a nightmare
and I bombed.

51:31.131 --> 51:33.307
Never forget, it's the only time
I've ever bailed on my time.

51:33.394 --> 51:34.743
You know, everyone bombs.

51:34.830 --> 51:36.528
And again, you know,

51:36.615 --> 51:38.399
what might be a bomb today

51:38.486 --> 51:41.054
might be considered
grand art 10 years from now.

51:41.141 --> 51:43.317
[William H. Macy]
I find stand-up really tough,

51:43.404 --> 51:45.363
'cause if it's not great,

51:45.450 --> 51:48.279
I find that the actor in me
just wants to die.

51:48.366 --> 51:50.063
I have to leave the theater.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.065
If they're dying,
I'm dying worse.

51:52.152 --> 51:54.546
I so vicariously
suffer with them,

51:54.633 --> 51:56.461
but when they're
good at it, it just--

51:56.548 --> 51:57.984
it's a mystery to me.

51:58.071 --> 51:59.812
I don't get how they do it.

52:01.814 --> 52:04.904
I wouldn't do stand-up
with a gun to my head.

52:04.991 --> 52:07.298
[Pollak]
What goes through your
mind when you just hear

52:07.385 --> 52:10.257
crickets in
the audiences?

52:10.344 --> 52:13.260
Uh, failing on stage
as a stand-up

52:13.347 --> 52:16.916
is a quick descent into,
"They hate me,

52:17.003 --> 52:19.919
"my life has no value, uh,

52:20.006 --> 52:23.575
I'm alone,
I'll never be funny again."

52:23.662 --> 52:27.274
[Jeffries]
My father watched me
get no laughs

52:27.361 --> 52:29.276
on my set-- like, none.

52:29.363 --> 52:31.278
And I got off stage, 17,

52:31.365 --> 52:33.367
and I went to the bathroom
and had a little cry

52:33.454 --> 52:35.195
and then I got
in the car with my dad,

52:35.282 --> 52:36.718
and my dad said, he goes,

52:36.805 --> 52:39.504
"Aw, I don't think this
is for you, mate,

52:39.591 --> 52:41.375
"this is not a bad
little hobby.

52:41.462 --> 52:44.117
And, you know, if it means
anything, I think you're funny."

52:44.204 --> 52:46.598
You know, he was very
supportive, but he told me

52:46.685 --> 52:48.861
to quit it and I did.

52:48.948 --> 52:51.516
I did one more go,
and it went average,

52:51.603 --> 52:54.258
and I thought, "Well,
this is it, it's not for me."

52:54.345 --> 52:58.871
The one thing I think
is a common denominator
of all comedians

52:58.958 --> 53:01.090
and that is a bond.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.441
Is that, uh,

53:03.528 --> 53:07.184
in order to become a comic,
pay attention,

53:07.271 --> 53:09.229
you have to love

53:09.316 --> 53:11.188
watching yourself die.

53:12.667 --> 53:15.627
You have to-- because
when you're learning it,

53:15.714 --> 53:17.498
you're bombing a lot,

53:17.585 --> 53:19.631
there's more than crickets,
there's hate.

53:19.718 --> 53:22.851
There's, like, sharks,
and you're bleeding

53:22.938 --> 53:25.376
and they're nipping,
and, you know...

53:25.463 --> 53:27.204
One of the great lines
ever yelled at me,

53:27.291 --> 53:30.163
"Why don't you go home
and gargle with razorblades?"

53:30.250 --> 53:31.295
Which crippled me.

53:31.382 --> 53:32.731
I laughed so fucking hard,

53:32.818 --> 53:34.820
I said,
"I'm done, you win, that's...

53:34.907 --> 53:38.606
that's so good,
I'm gonna use it."

53:38.693 --> 53:40.695
Probably one-- maybe
the first or second time I ever,

53:40.782 --> 53:43.742
like, bombed,
I don't know why,

53:43.829 --> 53:46.310
but my fight-or-flight
instinct kicked in

53:46.397 --> 53:48.877
and evidently,
it was flight.

53:48.964 --> 53:51.358
I was supposed to do
seven minutes

53:51.445 --> 53:53.882
and I got up there

53:53.969 --> 53:57.146
and I already told the host
what my closer was,

53:57.234 --> 54:00.237
and I got up there and I did

54:00.324 --> 54:03.109
probably three minutes
of my act

54:03.196 --> 54:05.067
to silence,

54:05.154 --> 54:08.767
and then I was like,
"Well, I have four minutes left

54:08.854 --> 54:11.813
and I'm not gonna spend it in
four more minutes of silence,"

54:11.900 --> 54:14.381
so I just immediately
jumped to my closer,

54:14.468 --> 54:17.210
which takes-- probably
took about 35 seconds,

54:17.297 --> 54:19.734
and I did my closing bit
and went, "All right, thanks."

54:19.821 --> 54:23.347
Total time on stage was probably
four minutes, if that.

54:23.434 --> 54:25.349
And then one of
the other comics went,

54:25.436 --> 54:28.265
"Yeah, I know, it sucks to eat
shit, but you can't do that."

54:28.352 --> 54:30.179
I was like, "Oh, really?

54:30.267 --> 54:32.747
I can't just bail if
it's not going well?"
"No!"

54:32.834 --> 54:36.229
This did happen recently,

54:36.316 --> 54:38.449
semi-recently, Spinal Tap,

54:38.536 --> 54:40.886
based on this movie I did

54:40.973 --> 54:44.063
with Rob Reiner, Harry Shearer,
Michael McKean,

54:44.150 --> 54:47.719
we have played live
for the last 30 years,

54:47.806 --> 54:49.895
and we were doing
a show in Canada.

54:53.202 --> 54:54.552
That's because at that point,

54:54.639 --> 54:57.294
you're gonna
cut to a maple leaf.

54:58.947 --> 55:02.124
Um, we did a live performance

55:02.211 --> 55:04.083
and it was nothing.

55:04.170 --> 55:07.869
I mean, zero. It wasn't--
There was no recognition.

55:07.956 --> 55:11.569
[French accent]
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Spinal Tap.

55:12.744 --> 55:14.833
[Pollak laughing]

55:16.400 --> 55:18.967
Singing, playing, big bottom.

55:19.054 --> 55:20.317
[Pollak] Jesus.

55:20.404 --> 55:21.753
And then we said...

55:23.537 --> 55:25.409
[mimics tapping microphone]
You know, that thing.

55:25.496 --> 55:28.803
And it truly was...
[laughing]

55:28.890 --> 55:31.763
something I've never
experienced before or since.

55:31.850 --> 55:35.941
The award before me
is won by Raul Julia,

55:36.028 --> 55:39.597
a brilliant, wonderful actor,
who had died that year.

55:39.684 --> 55:42.687
And the widow Julia
comes up...[Pollak] No, no.

55:42.774 --> 55:45.820
...to take the award
and accept it.

55:45.907 --> 55:48.432
And it was an amazing speech,

55:48.519 --> 55:51.565
but I mean,
people are weeping.

55:51.652 --> 55:53.611
And I'm backstage and I go,

55:53.698 --> 55:56.265
"For fuck's sake,
I keep having to do this shit

55:56.353 --> 55:58.180
following dead people!"

55:58.267 --> 56:00.748
Well, the crew backstage is
going, "Oh, that's so funny!

56:00.835 --> 56:03.185
You gotta say that!
You gotta say that!"

56:03.272 --> 56:07.059
And I went-- having
no experience with this,
I go, "Really?"

56:07.146 --> 56:09.757
This is like the band has said,
"Hey, that's a great joke,

56:09.844 --> 56:11.542
you should tell it on stage."

56:11.629 --> 56:14.588
So on live television,
I decide to go off-script...

56:14.675 --> 56:16.198
[laughing]

56:16.285 --> 56:18.984
and I come out and I go,
"What the hell is it?

56:19.071 --> 56:21.987
"On the Emmy awards,
I follow dead Jessica Tandy

56:22.074 --> 56:24.729
and now I follow a dead--
another dead guy."

56:24.816 --> 56:28.210
I mean, the boos
and the hisses

56:28.297 --> 56:30.474
and the hostility.

56:30.561 --> 56:32.214
And I--

56:32.301 --> 56:34.739
I had never produced sweat
like that in my life.

56:34.826 --> 56:37.132
It was like Albert Brooks
in "Broadcast News."

56:37.219 --> 56:39.134
So I-- I go to close up
and same deal,

56:39.221 --> 56:41.049
I say, "I'm gonna tell you
one more thing then go."

56:41.136 --> 56:42.529
Some guy yells out,

56:42.616 --> 56:45.489
"Don't even tell us that,
just go!"

56:45.576 --> 56:47.012
And another sailor--

56:47.099 --> 56:48.927
it's a naval base,
another sailor stands up

56:49.014 --> 56:50.755
and says, "Leave him alone,
I think he's pretty funny."

56:50.842 --> 56:54.019
And looks around,
nobody's on his side.

56:54.106 --> 56:56.500
And he goes,
"Not that fucking funny."

56:56.587 --> 56:58.110
Sits down.

56:58.197 --> 57:00.329
I do my closing joke
to silence and I say,

57:00.417 --> 57:03.507
"Well, that's it for me,
if you see a dick, suck it."

57:03.594 --> 57:05.770
And I run off the stage

57:05.857 --> 57:09.121
and the woman has my check
in one hand and my jacket
in the other

57:09.208 --> 57:12.777
and she says, "Get out of here,
they will kill you."

57:12.864 --> 57:16.041
So they literally are chasing--
I'm running to my car

57:16.128 --> 57:17.999
and they're chasing me and
it's almost like a horror movie

57:18.086 --> 57:21.176
where they never
get closer than 15 feet.

57:21.263 --> 57:23.265
Like, consistently,
they're like--

57:23.352 --> 57:26.138
And I get to my car and there's
always that scene in the movie

57:26.225 --> 57:27.705
where the guy
tries to open up the door

57:27.792 --> 57:29.968
and you think
it's bullshit, it's not.

57:30.055 --> 57:32.449
I all of a sudden don't know how
to use a key and I'm panicking

57:32.536 --> 57:33.972
and I'm trying
to get in my car.

57:34.059 --> 57:35.626
And to look at it
objectively as an adult,

57:35.713 --> 57:38.585
to be in a bar,

57:38.672 --> 57:40.674
in a spotlight,

57:40.761 --> 57:43.547
with a stick that
makes your voice louder,

57:43.634 --> 57:46.245
like, to just
demand that attention

57:46.332 --> 57:50.597
and to not pay it off,

57:50.684 --> 57:52.817
and to have people hate you,

57:52.904 --> 57:56.168
I mean, that is
a really naked,

57:56.255 --> 57:59.693
creepy, uh,

57:59.780 --> 58:03.218
kind of torment
to put yourself through.

58:03.305 --> 58:06.700
If I'm on stage and it's not
going as well as I'd hoped,

58:06.787 --> 58:09.573
perhaps in the past,
I might've sped up.

58:09.660 --> 58:12.140
Now, I have a little trick.

58:12.227 --> 58:15.883
I just slow...
right... down.[Pollak] Yeah.

58:15.970 --> 58:18.451
And I smile a bit
and you just trick 'em.

58:18.538 --> 58:22.411
You think, "My God,
I thought he was doing badly,

58:22.499 --> 58:24.588
"but look how relaxed he is.

58:24.675 --> 58:26.415
"It must be me.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.156
"I must be misreading this.

58:28.243 --> 58:29.810
This guy's actually
very good."

58:29.897 --> 58:32.726
I was up for this pilot
for a reality show

58:32.813 --> 58:35.294
and I was doing it
with Adam Sandler.

58:35.381 --> 58:39.037
Me, Adam Sandler, and I think
Rob Schneider or David Spade,

58:39.124 --> 58:41.735
and it was gonna be guys
travelling across America

58:41.822 --> 58:44.259
with video cameras and, uh,

58:44.346 --> 58:47.045
we were all unknowns
and Jim Henson was the producer.

58:47.132 --> 58:50.048
So we went out and we filmed
our own audition ourselves.

58:50.135 --> 58:52.093
And then they called me
and they said,

58:52.180 --> 58:54.487
"Jim Henson would like
to buy your ideas.

58:54.574 --> 58:56.271
"He liked a lot
of your ideas,

58:56.358 --> 58:58.796
"but he doesn't think
you should be on camera

58:58.883 --> 59:02.060
because he thinks
you lack warmth."

59:02.147 --> 59:06.064
And I thought, "This is the guy
who taught me how to read.

59:06.151 --> 59:08.545
"This is Kermit the Frog.

59:08.632 --> 59:09.981
"This is Sesame Street.

59:10.068 --> 59:12.026
"This is the warmest man
in the world

59:12.113 --> 59:14.376
telling me I lack warmth."

59:14.463 --> 59:17.205
So I think all of
these things made me think,

59:17.292 --> 59:21.470
"Oh, maybe I just
should not be on screen.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.821
Jim Henson hates me."

59:23.908 --> 59:26.606
If I couldn't do stand-up,

59:26.693 --> 59:29.043
I am out of luck.

59:29.130 --> 59:32.090
That power of, like, writing
a joke and going up that day

59:32.177 --> 59:34.527
and not having to worry about
anybody else chiming in.

59:34.614 --> 59:37.008
Only two things
I wanted in life--

59:37.095 --> 59:40.228
one was to be from New York City
and the other was to be Jewish.

59:40.315 --> 59:42.100
But then, you know,
I learned to juggle

59:42.187 --> 59:46.670
and all hopes of being
taken seriously go away.

59:46.757 --> 59:49.673
[Pollak] Or Jewish.Yes.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.936
All hopes of being
Jewish go away.

59:52.023 --> 59:54.547
[Schumer]
It does feel really good to--

59:54.634 --> 59:56.027
I felt like there was just
something a little bit weird
about you your whole life

59:56.114 --> 59:57.681
and why do I want
to make people laugh,

59:57.768 --> 59:58.769
but then I want
to disappear also?

59:58.856 --> 01:00:00.205
And then you--

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:02.163
You meet all these
other people

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.035
that are just like you,
and they liked the shows

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:06.559
that you liked
when you were a kid,

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.735
and people thought
they were mean,

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:10.258
and people
thought they were weird,

01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:12.696
and you're all weird
together.

01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:14.872
And they become
like your family,

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:18.092
but then it makes you...

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:22.227
retract from--
from normal people.

01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:24.490
We speak the same
language,

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:27.406
and I never
really feel

01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:30.844
as comfortable as
I feel with comedians

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:33.499
with anyone else.

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:36.241
And then bringing a guy
around comedians, like,

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.721
"This is Joe,"

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.766
and they're all
like, "Okay."

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:42.769
And I'm like,
"Oh, you're right."

01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:45.250
[Pollak]
How much of it is
an enjoyment of--

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:47.034
of making
the other two laugh?

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:50.516
Oh, it's the best.
Well, I'm--

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.214
This is where I'm a little
more different than these two.

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.955
There are guys that
Jimmy doesn't like us

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:56.261
talking to
on the radio,

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.219
and I can't wait
for them to call in,

01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:01.135
hit that phone, knowing
it's gonna drive him nuts,

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:04.269
or, you know,
back in the old days

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:05.792
more than now,

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:07.925
I would really push
people's buttons

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:10.362
to the point these two
would get so uncomfortable,

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:12.233
and you would think
that would be my cue

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.757
to back off,
but now I'm like,

01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:15.236
"Oh, they're
uncomfortable?

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:17.108
Let me see how far
I can take this."

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:19.588
And I've had these guys,
like, walk out of the studio,

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.721
walk behind equipment.

01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:23.636
Oh, yeah, yeah.Just completely...

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:26.291
Horrified.
Horrified,
embarrassed.

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.162
It really is uncanny
how uncomfortable

01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:30.208
he could make me with
talking to certain guests.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:32.427
It was-- it was funny,
and I look back on it,

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:33.777
and they're some
of my favorite moments,

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:35.169
and it's-- but it's like--

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:37.911
I don't have the ability
to do that.

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.870
Like, I would just go,
"Oh, no, I'm just kidding."

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.828
Right, right.Like, I would have
to fucking, you know,

01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:43.787
emotionally whore it out
and ruin it.

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:45.745
I've always been
self-centered.

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.660
I think you have
to be self-centered

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.663
in order to do
this kind of thing,
a little bit.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.971
So much of comedy
is confidence

01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:56.147
and believing, you know,

01:01:56.234 --> 01:01:58.105
faking it till
you make it, I think.

01:01:58.192 --> 01:01:59.803
When I was doing
"The State,"

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.805
I was among
11 friends,

01:02:01.892 --> 01:02:04.111
ten of them guys,

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:07.288
on MTV doing this show
in our early 20s,

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.421
and it was
a dream for us

01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:11.771
because we had the keys
to the kingdom.

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:13.207
We got to make
our own TV show

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.557
just out of college,
it was crazy.

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:17.385
But among the group,

01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:18.996
the 11 of us,
it was very competitive

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.346
and very painful
at times.

01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:23.435
March of 1977,

01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:27.091
and Paul Shaffer was
in town, in L.A.

01:02:27.178 --> 01:02:28.483
And Nancy and I were

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.486
staying with
a friend of ours, and--

01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:33.575
My girlfriend Nancy,
later to be my wife--

01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:35.664
and Paul was in town,

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.971
and he was gonna have
dinner with Billy Murray,

01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:39.625
who just, you know,
started that year

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:41.061
on Saturday Night Live.

01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:43.672
And Nancy and I were
walking along

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.370
Santa Monica Boulevard.

01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:48.112
We're going to go
to the Sunset Marquis Hotel.

01:02:48.199 --> 01:02:50.810
And I just
said to her,

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:53.247
"I can't walk
anymore."

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:55.902
"What do you mean?
Are you having a stroke?"

01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:57.730
I said,
"No, I just--

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.471
I gotta sit down."

01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:00.689
So we sat in the bench.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.430
She said,
"What's wrong?"

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.911
"I can't go and have dinner
with Paul and Billy

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:08.045
"and pretend to be happy
for everyone's success,

01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:09.960
"because I am floating,

01:03:10.047 --> 01:03:11.613
and I don't know
what to do."

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.746
"Ahh."

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:17.184
♪♪ [whistling]

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:18.707
"How long
do we sit here?"

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.492
"I don't know.
I don't know.

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:22.059
Maybe the night."

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.756
So later on, whenever
we would pass it,

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:24.888
we'd call it, oh,
"There's Breakdown Corner."

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:26.803
Remember
Breakdown Corner?

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.500
[Perry]
We had a conversation
once where, you know,

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:31.068
you were trying to do a TV show,
and I was saying,

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.634
"All we're trying to do
is get movies."

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.767
And it's
this sort of...

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:36.987
not happy with
the room you're in

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.510
no matter what
the room is.

01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:40.555
So...

01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:42.253
We're on this gigantic
television show,

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.689
and all of us are
just thinking, well,

01:03:43.776 --> 01:03:45.169
"On hiatus,
we gotta get a movie,

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:46.518
"'cause we want to be
a movie star,

01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:48.259
because we should
be movie stars."

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:52.002
That, thankfully,
has completely changed,

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:53.568
and now
I love vacations

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:57.442
and love having downtime
to a certain extent.

01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:59.444
But there is still
that part of me that,

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:02.099
you know, wants to be--
wants to be working.

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.796
[Carlin]
My dad was very
protective of me,

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.711
another way in which
he protected me

01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:07.844
was actually say to me,

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:11.412
I really would
not forbid you

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.893
but really, really
encourage you

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.287
to stay away from
stand-up comedy,

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.898
because
it's a ruthless world

01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:21.292
and it's a tough life,

01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:23.729
as I knew,
as a kid,

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:25.122
and then
the club circuit,

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:26.210
very different
than what he did,

01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:27.820
an even tougher life,

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:29.648
and I think he really
wanted to protect me

01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:33.130
from that moment when
some heckler shouted out,

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:35.088
"Where's the funny,
Carlin?"

01:04:35.175 --> 01:04:36.611
[Pollak]
The theory,
that comedians are

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.700
veterans of a shared
combat experience,

01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:40.267
not foxhole buddies,

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:43.575
more like
snipers who've--

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.098
Did you write that?
[Pollak]
Yes.

01:04:45.185 --> 01:04:48.319
With similar stories
of kills and misses.

01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:49.973
Ahh.
That's fantastic.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.496
[Pollak]
There's only so many
bell towers.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.933
Yeah, no kidding.
I brought my lunch.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.979
I could be up here
all night.

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:58.416
I have a box of dynamite, too,
in case it gets out of hand.

01:04:58.503 --> 01:04:59.983
I think there is
a fraternity of comedians.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:01.506
That's how
I look at it.

01:05:01.593 --> 01:05:02.855
Men and women.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:04.204
Other than
one or two people

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.032
that you detest
beyond all measure,

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.381
we all get along
with each other,

01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:08.687
and when you're
working together,

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:09.949
you're on their side.

01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:11.472
I've been
in many shows

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:12.865
where even people
I didn't like very much,

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:14.432
the crowd will
have a go at them

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:16.086
and I would go on after
and fucking mop up,

01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:18.653
on behalf of them.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.699
I've done it before,
I remember a time in L.A.

01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:22.919
I won't say who the comic was,
but he didn't do very well,

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.355
and the crowd was
on his dick,

01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:25.573
and I came up
after him and went,

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.923
"You people are
fucking morons.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.881
"That guy's a genius,
and don't ever,

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.230
ever do that in
my presence again."

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.537
You know, and then
I've had crowds

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:34.234
be racist when
you're with a black comic,

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.497
to the black comic, and then
I'll get up and go,

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:38.151
"You're making
a mistake, you think that,

01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:39.718
"'cause I'm white,
I'm on your side.

01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:41.198
"I'm on his side,

01:05:41.285 --> 01:05:44.157
'cause we're friends,
and I hate you."

01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:47.117
One time
I masturbated in a church.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.857
Um...

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.033
[Pollak]
We'll take that.
Okay.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.251
Yeah.I mean, I was--

01:05:51.338 --> 01:05:53.036
I was, you know,
a teenager.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.211
It was
almost a soc...

01:05:54.298 --> 01:05:57.040
a socio-religious experiment.

01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:58.171
I'm gonna do this,
and I wonder if

01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.390
anything bad's gonna happen,

01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:01.044
or I wonder
if this is okay,

01:06:01.131 --> 01:06:02.741
or if this is natural.

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:04.221
And then I did it,
and nothing really happened,

01:06:04.308 --> 01:06:05.831
and I was like,
"Well, I guess I can

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:08.051
check that
off the list."

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:11.141
I've not done that
since then.

01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:12.577
It was really
just the one time.

01:06:12.664 --> 01:06:13.926
[Pollak] Was it during
confession?

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.536
It was--

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:18.061
I didn't masturbate
in front of the altar.

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:19.540
No, that's--
If I had done that,

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:21.542
I would have been
a serial killer,

01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:24.545
as I was
shaving my whole body,

01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:26.243
masturbating
in front of--

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.245
that didn't happen,
it was, you know,

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:29.986
I-- look, look.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.378
I masturbated
in a church

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:32.727
in the best way
that you could have,

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:34.381
which was quietly
in the bathroom,

01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:36.253
like,
it wasn't out in public.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.776
[Pollak] Well, I think it's
important you clarify,

01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:39.256
'cause a lot of us
had you in the pews.

01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:40.822
I was not in the pews.

01:06:40.909 --> 01:06:43.564
I was going pew-pew-pew,
pew-pew-pew-pew-pew.

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:46.741
I always find it
fascinating even now,

01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:48.961
but when I was back
just doing stand-up

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:53.096
that, if you go to parties,
comedians end up together.

01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:56.360
They flock,
they flock together,

01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:57.970
and, like, you can be
at a party, any--

01:06:58.057 --> 01:07:00.016
You can be
at the biggest,

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.669
craziest, you know,

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:05.804
Oprah's whatever party,
you can be at the--

01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:08.067
And all the comedians
end up at the same table
or in the same corner.

01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:10.635
[Pollak] And then we get
together and talk about
the hits and misses.

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:12.463
[Fallon]
The hits and misses,
that's exactly what it is.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.378
You get together, and you want
to hear road stories,

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:16.032
and you want to hear, like,
"Oh, no, I know that booker,

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.686
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
or "I opened for that person,

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.210
oh, they're the worst,"
or whatever it is.

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.907
It's just--
it fascinates me.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.648
Or you can go like,
"Who is that comedian that

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.650
"did the-- remember, they did
the bit with the--

01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:27.304
"There was, like,
a midget in--

01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:28.653
And you go, "Oh, I know
who that was, that was--"

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.176
And you just say
the person's name,

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:31.438
it's like, thank God
you were here 'cause

01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:33.136
no one else
would get you.

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:35.486
By the time I got
to be 15,

01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:38.141
the juggling in the show

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.533
was shrinking,

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.187
and I was talking
more and more.

01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:43.407
And then I realized,
though, after that,

01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:45.278
that all the jokes
these comics were

01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:47.628
handing back to me
were about me.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:49.543
And I went, "Wait a minute,
you don't have to be a--"

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.198
You know, a hen could
figure this shit out.

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.721
I have to talk
about myself.

01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:56.028
Let's talk about
anything but this routine.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.595
I don't want to do it.

01:07:57.682 --> 01:07:59.466
I don't want to say it,
I know it's gonna work.

01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:01.120
I don't care, it's worked
a thousand times--

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:02.687
I don't give a shit.

01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:05.516
I hate you for laughing,
you sheep, you lemmings.

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:07.518
For 40 years, I've been punching
out of a paper bag

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:10.434
to find out what I'm allowed
to say and not allowed to say.

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:12.697
So take your pants off
and don't move

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:14.655
is kind of
the theme of my comedy.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:17.310
The first thing you learn
is how to avoid...

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:20.183
pain and the ultimate
failure, which is death.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.055
You'll never be dead, they'll
just make you finish one day.

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.535
And I was in Buffalo,
and I was in the middle of--

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:25.970
It wasn't a packed house,

01:08:26.058 --> 01:08:27.189
but I was in
the middle of a joke,

01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:29.192
and I'm like,
I can't do it.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.107
I just--
I'm tired of myself.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.630
I'm saying this out loud.
I'm like,

01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:34.197
I don't know what
we're gonna fucking do,

01:08:34.283 --> 01:08:36.328
but I can't do this.

01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:37.678
And they're all sitting
there like, you know,

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:39.158
you're in charge,
and you're just

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:41.639
looking out
at people like...

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.554
You know, right?[Pollak]
Is this part of the act?

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.207
Yeah, right.
And I'm like--

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.904
But you know, we really--
my fans are like,

01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:49.255
"All right, Maron's just
gonna... let him find it."

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.649
He's struggling.
He does this sometimes.

01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.303
You know,
on some level,

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.218
if they are my fans,
it's like,

01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:57.133
"It happens,
I know him."

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.569
So... [laughing]

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:01.572
So I sat up there
for, like, 45 seconds

01:09:01.658 --> 01:09:03.877
just sort of like,
"Oh, shit."

01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:06.837
Like, in that silence,
and there's nothing more...

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.926
There's no more present
than that.

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:10.493
You know,
where you're like, you know,

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.452
they have expectations,
you're not filling them,

01:09:12.538 --> 01:09:14.193
and you're alone on stage

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.586
and they're watching you
sit there,

01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:17.935
and I'm like,
"Oh, goddamn it."

01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:19.764
Nobody wants my advice.
No comedians want my advice,

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.721
but if I was gonna give
advice to people,

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:24.464
my advice would be,
if you say something funny

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.858
in the moment, you better
write it down.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.251
Stop editing yourself.

01:09:28.337 --> 01:09:29.600
"Oh, that won't work
on stage"

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.254
or "That was too funny" or--

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:33.125
I am proud of myself
that I write

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:35.736
almost every
single thing down,

01:09:35.823 --> 01:09:38.435
funny, unfunny,
laundry lists.

01:09:38.522 --> 01:09:40.263
I heard a thump,

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.872
and I looked
to the side of the stage,

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.962
and somebody threw their
prosthetic leg onstage

01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:47.139
with a shoe on it,
a hiking boot, and a sock.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.618
It was kind of rubber.

01:09:48.706 --> 01:09:50.881
And...

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.406
the crowd was
just as astonished as I was,

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.756
and I said, "Who threw
the leg up here?"

01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:58.106
And nobody
would answer.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.283
And I think if you're just
starting out as a comic,

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:01.675
it might throw you,
but, because I've been

01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:03.416
doing it so long,
and I'm looking

01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:05.636
for something like that,
we had a lot of fun with it.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.072
You know, I put it up
on the stool,

01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:09.161
we tried doing
forensic research on it.

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:10.728
Well, you know,
from the--

01:10:10.815 --> 01:10:12.469
You know, from
the texture of the rubber,

01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:13.818
it doesn't look like this
person works out much.

01:10:13.905 --> 01:10:16.299
It looks like
a male Caucasian leg,

01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:17.648
about five-eight,

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:19.519
about 200-plus pounds,

01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:21.869
and you know, the audience
was loving it, you know.

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:24.481
Whose is this?
Hop up here and get it.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.309
Houston Laugh Stop,
it was one of the...

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:28.702
craziest ever,
just chaos.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.444
Like, literally
people beat each other up.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:34.491
Just customers beat the shit
out of each other.

01:10:34.578 --> 01:10:36.449
I was like, "Wow."

01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:39.452
I'm ordering beers on stage,
no one cares.

01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:41.759
Just a free-for all,
so after that, I have no plans.

01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:43.804
Once people start
beating each other up,

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:46.242
I'm now just another
customer.
[Pollak laughs]

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:49.636
You know, you can be on stage
doing your stand-up routine,

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:52.639
and because you've done it
50 times already,

01:10:52.726 --> 01:10:55.207
your mind can
slightly wander,

01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:56.991
even as you're saying
your act.

01:10:57.078 --> 01:10:58.819
You're doing your act,
the audience is responding,

01:10:58.906 --> 01:11:00.865
but your mind is
actually thinking
about other things,

01:11:00.952 --> 01:11:02.780
You can consciously be
in two places at once.

01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:04.477
You can hear
your mouth moving,

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:05.870
but you can be
thinking,

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:07.219
"Where are we gonna
eat after this?"

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.874
It's a very
bizarre thing,

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:13.878
and I remember once
being on stage and--

01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:16.707
and I just was very aware
of the absurdity

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:19.231
of the whole situation,

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.928
like, not just
the fact that

01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:22.843
I was in front of a room
talking, which was weird,

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.845
when you step above it,
that seems weird,

01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:27.370
and that your job is
to make them laugh,

01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:28.980
like a jester,
that was weird,

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:31.635
but also the--
the pointlessness of it all

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:35.508
and I remember sort of
feeling...

01:11:35.595 --> 01:11:37.118
and then kind of
coming back again,

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:38.816
back into that moment,
and, like, oh, well,

01:11:38.903 --> 01:11:40.513
there's
nothing else to do.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.341
This is as good a thing
to be doing at this moment

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.821
as anything else.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.954
Should I share my life
with somebody?

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.088
Uh... was I
a good enough husband?

01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:52.699
Can I actually
coexist

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:54.440
with another
human being?

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:57.182
Do I tell people that I love
that I love them enough?

01:11:57.269 --> 01:12:00.403
Have I told my parents
enough that I love them?

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:03.144
Am I honest enough with
the people in my life?

01:12:03.231 --> 01:12:07.018
Am I grateful enough
for how lucky I've been?

01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:10.151
These are the questions
that nag at me

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:11.762
when I'm in the car,

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:13.416
when I wake up
in the middle of the night,

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:15.331
and I'm just-- I'm up
from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:17.811
And this is the stuff that
I end up making movies about,

01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:19.422
and I think this is
the stuff that we end up

01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:21.946
all... writing comedy,

01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:23.513
writing books,
making movies,

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.297
painting paintings,
this is the stuff

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:27.604
that finds
its way into the work,

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:29.127
and if you're not doing--
if you're not

01:12:29.214 --> 01:12:30.737
working on that stuff,

01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:32.652
then you're not really
working on anything.

01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:34.654
I've carried for so many years
a chip on my shoulder

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:37.570
from my childhood
or my working class background

01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:39.529
that, you know,

01:12:39.616 --> 01:12:41.705
when I meet a kid
who grew up with cash,

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.751
and he's a comic or something,
I'm very dismissive of them.

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:46.318
I'm like,
"You don't fucking know.

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:47.537
What do you got
to talk about?"

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:49.930
And now,
I'm bringing up one,

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:51.802
and it's like... I guess
what you do is

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:53.760
you don't give them anything
and you make them have jobs,

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:55.414
you make them
buy their own car,

01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:56.981
and there's things
that I can do

01:12:57.068 --> 01:12:58.461
that my parents
made me do through necessity

01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:01.638
that I can just do
to be a dick.

01:13:01.725 --> 01:13:03.466
But there's things
that I'm not willing to do.

01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:05.381
I'm not-- I'm not willing

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:08.471
to take him on
shitty holidays...

01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:09.776
and that was a lot
of my memories,

01:13:09.863 --> 01:13:11.604
is sitting
in a caravan park

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:13.258
with my parents, 'cause
I don't want to have

01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:14.825
shitty fucking holidays.

01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:17.088
I want the coconut
on the island,

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:18.524
so that means that
little cunt's gonna be

01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:19.786
sitting there with
a coconut, too,

01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:21.832
being waited on hand and foot.

01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:23.921
So how do I stop him
from being a fuckwit?

01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.662
And then if he wants
to be a comic,

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:28.012
I-- you know,
I think about that as well,

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:29.796
like, people go, "You think
he'll want to be a comic?"

01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:33.060
I go, "Why the fuck
would he want to be a comic?"

01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:35.759
It's like, I was watching
some talent show,

01:13:35.846 --> 01:13:39.371
"America's Got Talent,"
and they had a family

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.591
of people that were
on unicycles

01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.288
spinning basketballs,

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.203
and they had eight kids
or 12 kids or something--

01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:48.641
there was a lot of kids,
and all the kids...

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:50.077
were spinning
basketballs,

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:51.601
riding unicycles.

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:54.125
And I just think,
that's got to be

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.649
one person's passion
in that whole group.

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.695
It can't be that much
of a coincidence.

01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:00.218
[Pollak laughs]

01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:01.828
It can't be
that much of a coincidence

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.177
that the whole family is going,
"You know what?

01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:04.788
"That's what
I'm into as well.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:07.225
Unicycle basketball
spinning."

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:09.009
And especially
to be spinning a basketball

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:10.271
when you're 19,

01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:12.578
and your sister's
three.

01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:14.014
It's like,
"Come on and practice

01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:15.538
with your sister on
the unicycle,"

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:17.191
and you're like,
"I don't wanna--"

01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:18.932
You know, I don't care
how religious you are,

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:20.804
or that you have
so many kids,

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:23.633
and you want to have
a family that sticks together,

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.199
but I think--

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:26.897
I know you didn't
ask me about parenting,

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:29.203
but I think about it
a lot at the moment.

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.118
I think parenting

01:14:31.205 --> 01:14:35.122
is getting them
so they don't need you.

01:14:36.515 --> 01:14:37.690
[Pollak]
Stand on your own.

01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:39.257
Yeah, I think
it's getting--

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:41.085
And then, hopefully...

01:14:41.172 --> 01:14:43.957
they love you and want
to visit you occasionally.

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:45.698
I feel that
there's safety

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:47.918
in accomplishing
something

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:50.790
and being in
the middle of a task.

01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.226
[Pollak]
Safety.

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:54.751
Yeah, the safety is
in the doing.

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:56.404
You know,
for a long time, I thought,

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.710
"If something succeeds,

01:14:57.797 --> 01:14:59.190
that'll make me
feel better."

01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:01.888
And having had certain
things succeed,

01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:03.107
I've had
certain things fail,

01:15:03.194 --> 01:15:05.109
but I've had things
succeed,

01:15:05.196 --> 01:15:06.763
to the point
where you think, "Well,

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.592
that's the moment where
happiness will happen."

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:11.028
You know,
the movie did well,

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:12.769
or people liked it,
and I realize,

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:15.119
I'm getting almost
no happiness out of it.

01:15:15.206 --> 01:15:16.599
That, for me,

01:15:16.686 --> 01:15:18.122
it's all in the moment.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.602
It's just...
[Pollak]
The doing it.

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.212
It is,
it's editing, it's...

01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:23.127
it's trying to figure
things out,

01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:24.607
and that makes me
feel a little safe,

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:26.826
that I'm in the process

01:15:26.913 --> 01:15:30.090
of trying to make
something work out.

01:15:30.177 --> 01:15:31.483
And so...

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.050
that's not
healthy either.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:34.791
And so, to realize,
"Oh, I need to find

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.183
a way to be happy,

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:37.663
not when something
worked out,

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.795
and not in
the process,

01:15:38.882 --> 01:15:41.014
but just in nothing,

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:44.148
and I am so far
from accomplishing that.

01:15:44.235 --> 01:15:46.019
Right, so that's
the essential question, right?

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:47.978
That's what every--
every comedian wonders.

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:50.807
Do you have to be miserable
to be funny?

01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:52.896
Every comedian's
history and background

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.767
and reason that they--

01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:56.552
you know,
realized they were funny,

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:59.032
and they started to do comedy
in one form or another,

01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:03.515
it has some roots in
trauma and pain and sadness.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:06.474
Not misery
but maybe annoyance.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.129
Jesus, why be miserable?

01:16:09.216 --> 01:16:11.436
I don't--
what's the upside in that?

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:15.396
So when I see a vegetable tray,
I'm annoyed.

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:18.051
[Pollak chuckling]I'm like,
no one wants that.

01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:20.358
Why are you putting it
out there?

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:22.926
Trying to pretend
that you're healthy?

01:16:23.013 --> 01:16:25.232
People are just gonna
eat the guacamole.

01:16:25.319 --> 01:16:28.018
Don't even
put out the radishes.

01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:29.672
What is this,
a seder?

01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:31.369
No one's gonna eat that.

01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:36.113
I think people who
don't quite fit in,

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.811
given the subject today
and find an outlet in comedy

01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:40.770
and find that
that's the thing where,

01:16:40.857 --> 01:16:43.599
if you-- the steam lets out
if you can just find that knob

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.122
and make a joke
out of it.

01:16:45.209 --> 01:16:47.080
Yeah,
I think that happens,

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:49.213
and I think it's one of the
great reasons for comedy.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.171
I'm not
personally miserable.

01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:53.304
I make those around me
miserable.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:55.436
You know what
makes people miserable?

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:56.873
My gesturing.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.092
But he had said
at one point, he goes,

01:16:59.179 --> 01:17:01.878
"I've had my foot
on the stool."

01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:03.619
And I was like,
what does that mean?

01:17:03.706 --> 01:17:05.533
And then I was like,
oh, my God,

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.581
literally, like, he's thinking
about not living anymore.

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:11.104
And I'm like,
how could somebody

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:14.020
this funny and original
not want to live?

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:15.805
So I said, hey, man, before you
think about killing yourself,

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:17.458
why don't you go
record a podcast?

01:17:17.545 --> 01:17:18.851
And he goes, yeah,
that's the cure for death.

01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:20.374
I was like, it could be,
I was like,

01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:21.811
every time
you're on Smodcast with me,

01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:23.551
people love you.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.814
People love Walt,
they think you guys are funny

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.554
and original and stuff.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.904
Three weeks after
he records the first podcast,

01:17:27.991 --> 01:17:29.427
he sends me this e-mail
where he's like,

01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:31.168
"I backed off the stool,"

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:32.909
and I was like,
"It's the talking cure, dude."

01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.738
As long as you're always candid
with them, it's win-win.

01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.174
The audience will
stick by you

01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:38.741
and be like,
"This motherfucker--

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:41.221
"He will tell me horrible things
about himself.

01:17:41.308 --> 01:17:43.180
Like, he'll tell me
that he takes

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.269
fucking dick medicine 'cause
it don't get hard or whatever,

01:17:45.356 --> 01:17:47.401
he'll tell us--
if he'll tell us that,

01:17:47.488 --> 01:17:49.708
next ten things he says are
fucking honest and shit.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:51.928
[Prinze, Jr.]
It's more of...

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:53.799
Just accepting
who he was, man.

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:55.975
I think once my mom was okay
with it,

01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:57.890
I was okay with it.

01:17:57.977 --> 01:18:00.110
As long as I saw that
it was hurting her,

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:02.199
and she was having
a tough time on her birthday--

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:04.288
that was the day he chose
to end his life--

01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:05.768
you know, it...

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:07.552
Then I didn't enjoy
any of it,

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:09.510
but once I saw that
she was more comfortable

01:18:09.597 --> 01:18:10.990
and once
she saw that I--

01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:13.036
that I had done
what I did,

01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:14.428
and I wasn't gonna fall
down that route,

01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:15.995
it's just not--
it's just not in me.

01:18:16.082 --> 01:18:18.258
I think everybody
has that...

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:19.956
has that moment
at some point in their life

01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:22.262
of, "Are people better off
without me?"

01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:23.786
And your brain is
either gonna allow you

01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:25.309
to pull the trigger
or take some pills,

01:18:25.396 --> 01:18:27.224
or it's not,
and mine won't.

01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:30.183
So she-- and we had
that conversation,

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:32.272
so once she knew that,
everything else was kinda--

01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:33.883
just sort of
fell into place.

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.536
You know, there's still
things I can't

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:37.103
possibly
wrap my head around.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.714
But I'm just wired
differently

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.063
than my father was,
you know what I mean?

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.151
I'm not-- I'm not
as funny as him,

01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:42.805
he's not as cool as me.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:45.590
That's just the way
it goes.
[Pollak laughs]

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:47.200
He was just like,

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.376
"I'm so far away from the stool
at this point,

01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:52.162
"and it's all from
talking about who I am

01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:54.904
"and who I am was who
I hated the most

01:18:54.991 --> 01:18:57.080
that put me
toward a stool."

01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:59.169
So this was a guy who never
thought about doing comedy,

01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:01.127
but comedy saved
his fucking life.

01:19:01.214 --> 01:19:03.826
And it's not traditional
comedy in the way, like,

01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:05.566
you'd find a guy
at a mic,

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:07.743
standing on a little stage
with a mic, you know.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.396
It's a guy
talking out his shit

01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:11.529
but with an inability
to do it in a dry way

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:13.226
or in a serious way.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:16.229
He has to deflate his own
balloon constantly,

01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:18.928
and, in doing so, like,
sharpen his comedic chops,

01:19:19.015 --> 01:19:20.538
introduce himself
to an audience

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.279
who were like,
"We like what you have to say."

01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:24.498
Suddenly, you can make a living
off of doing that stuff,

01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:26.500
and not just make
a living, like, pay his bills,

01:19:26.587 --> 01:19:27.763
but he can live.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.721
He's living
because of this.

01:19:29.808 --> 01:19:32.028
I wanted to tell him, like,
I booked my first job,

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:33.420
right, I booked...

01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:34.987
There was a show called
"Family Matters"

01:19:35.074 --> 01:19:36.684
with Urkel, right?
Everybody knows Urkel.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.034
And I had, like,
four lines.

01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:39.426
I was a kid who
brought a gun to school,

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:40.863
and they were trying
to get me--

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:42.168
Don't I look thuggish?

01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:43.866
Don't I look like
a bad kid?

01:19:43.953 --> 01:19:45.563
And...
[Pollak]
Also, who would say--

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:47.478
Also, who would say,
"Get me Freddie Prinze Jr.

01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:49.088
for the kid who comes
to school with a gun"?

01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:50.873
Yeah, right?
That's the only role I book,

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.222
is the gangster,
right?

01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:54.702
Scooby Doo was
way gangster.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.228
So I booked this job,
and I was crazy excited,

01:19:58.315 --> 01:19:59.969
the audition was at
Warner Brothers.

01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:02.145
Forest Lawn is
right behind Warner Brothers.

01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:04.060
I drove straight there,

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:05.801
and I just
had to say "Sorry,"

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:07.237
and I had to say
"Thank you,"

01:20:07.324 --> 01:20:08.455
and I had to get angry,

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:10.022
all in
one conversation.

01:20:10.109 --> 01:20:11.894
It was like, "Thank you,
I love you, fuck you."

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:13.417
It was everything,

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:15.593
but it all came out,
and it was just--

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.205
When you can sort of
vomit emotion like that,

01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:21.425
everything else starts
to kind of mellow out,

01:20:21.512 --> 01:20:22.948
and then when
people tell you stories

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:24.515
about your dad...

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:25.995
fucking everything in L.A.
but his wife,

01:20:26.082 --> 01:20:27.692
it doesn't
hurt as bad,

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:30.782
because you've kind of gone
through way worse.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.784
So you know,
as far as...

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:34.786
My mom's relationship
with it,

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:37.223
she has to believe
what she has to believe in,

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:38.746
and I respect that,

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.661
and she very well could be
right, you know,

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:42.620
but for me
to get by,

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:44.013
and for me to accept

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.275
in any way,
shape, or form

01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:46.711
what kind of a man
he was,

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.234
then I had
to be okay with...

01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:51.063
with how I perceived it
and how I saw it.

01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:52.978
When someone dies,
the last thing

01:20:53.065 --> 01:20:55.938
you think of is,
"Did they do the dishes?"

01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:57.765
You're like,
"Oh, my God, I hope...

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.811
he had enough sex, I hope
he was happy--" you know?

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:01.160
It's awful.

01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:02.379
You know,
once we started speaking

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:03.902
honestly about
ourselves,

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.599
and having
a point of view

01:21:05.686 --> 01:21:09.299
and not just being,
you know, a type of clown.

01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:11.083
Once comics started
to talk out loud

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:13.607
about their life
and life around them,

01:21:13.694 --> 01:21:15.392
people made this assumption,
like, "Oh, they got--

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:18.264
They're all
incredibly fucked up."

01:21:18.351 --> 01:21:20.658
But I don't-- I think
that's a mischaracterization.

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:22.138
You know, I...

01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:24.096
I think that struggle
is necessary,

01:21:24.183 --> 01:21:27.273
but I don't think
misery is necessary.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.319
You know
what's an interesting thing?

01:21:29.406 --> 01:21:31.147
Maybe you have to be insecure
to be funny.

01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:32.496
Maybe that's part of it.

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:34.193
You don't have to be
miserable.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.978
But there has to be
something wrong with you.

01:21:36.065 --> 01:21:38.197
[laughing]

01:21:38.284 --> 01:21:39.982
I don't think in theory

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:43.986
one needs to be miserable
to be funny.

01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:45.813
But I don't know
anyone close to me

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:49.295
that's not miserable.

01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.906
The people
I know really well

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:53.865
that are the funniest
are the most miserable.

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:56.999
I'm not miserable.

01:21:57.086 --> 01:22:00.176
I think
I'm just indifferent.

01:22:00.263 --> 01:22:02.004
I'm miserable
right now

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:04.528
because of what I'm going
through with my finances,

01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:07.835
and, at 58, I didn't want
to be in this position,

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:10.186
and whoever said
"money doesn't buy happiness,"

01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:12.884
I hope you're fucking dead,
'cause you're an idiot.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.277
'Cause
you know what?

01:22:14.364 --> 01:22:15.887
I'm only miserable

01:22:15.974 --> 01:22:17.497
because
I'm so depressed

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.021
because I'm working
so hard for so little,

01:22:19.108 --> 01:22:20.631
but there's a lot of people

01:22:20.718 --> 01:22:23.286
doing a lot worse
than I am, you know?

01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:24.896
"At least you got
your health."

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.289
Whatever Jewish idiot
said that, you're wrong.

01:22:26.376 --> 01:22:27.943
Health is good,
money is good.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:30.032
The combination is
just great.

01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:34.123
And I've talked
about this on stage a lot.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:37.213
I've suffered
from depression.

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.086
Been on and off antidepressants
for the last...

01:22:41.173 --> 01:22:43.393
Probably ten years or so,

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.090
and at times
I've been suicidal

01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:47.049
and not because of comedy,
but just, you know,

01:22:47.136 --> 01:22:48.920
other pressures
from the world,

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:51.009
and whatever,
and I realized

01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:55.057
that happiness isn't...

01:22:55.144 --> 01:22:56.754
isn't all about
stand-up comedy,

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.495
and I've only realized that
just recently,

01:22:58.582 --> 01:23:00.062
and people ask you
in interviews, they go,

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:02.020
"How would you like to be
remembered?"

01:23:02.107 --> 01:23:03.717
And I've got
to come to terms with--

01:23:03.804 --> 01:23:06.416
I might not be remembered,
and that doesn't matter.

01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:08.548
The only thing
I care about now

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:11.595
is how my son
remembers me.

01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:13.945
And if everyone else sorta
liked me, that's all right,

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:17.340
but as long as he thinks I was
a good guy, you know--

01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:18.863
When my dad dies,
I don't think

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:20.299
he was just a carpenter,

01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:21.822
I don't think
he's gonna be remembered

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:23.389
by the whole world,

01:23:23.476 --> 01:23:25.913
but he'll be
remembered by me.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.220
And that's--

01:23:28.307 --> 01:23:31.180
I'm working on
making that more important

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:34.096
than being remembered as
a great comedian.

01:23:34.183 --> 01:23:37.795
[Hardwick]
Everyone's miserable, everyone
has misery in their lives,

01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:40.450
but really, you know,
misery is just a form

01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:43.627
of dissatisfaction,
and so maybe--

01:23:43.714 --> 01:23:45.498
You know,
maybe comedy is really

01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:48.849
just taking dissatisfaction
and discomfort

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:51.243
and spinning it

01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:53.028
in a way that helps you
deal with it,

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:55.291
and then
people relate to it.

01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:58.555
Um, I think you at least
have to know misery.

01:23:58.642 --> 01:24:00.383
I don't think
comedians corner the market

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:02.515
on loneliness and need
for attention,

01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:05.736
but I think they have
to know it, certainly.

01:24:05.823 --> 01:24:07.172
[Pollak]
Yeah.

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:09.348
I think that's
where it comes from.

01:24:09.435 --> 01:24:11.046
Sort of a fear

01:24:11.133 --> 01:24:13.570
and...

01:24:13.657 --> 01:24:15.311
a protection of
that fear.

01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:17.052
To this day, I'm...

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:18.401
there's nowhere that
I'm funnier

01:24:18.488 --> 01:24:20.229
than in a doctor's office,

01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:22.535
'cause I'm a little scared
and a little--

01:24:22.622 --> 01:24:24.494
I'm hilarious
in a doctor's office.

01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:26.148
I bartended for
a long time.

01:24:26.235 --> 01:24:28.846
Let me just tell you,
the general public's

01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.456
kinda miserable.

01:24:30.543 --> 01:24:33.285
I don't think
it's because--

01:24:33.372 --> 01:24:36.462
I think we just have
a faster track to misery,

01:24:36.549 --> 01:24:38.029
and it's more
available.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:39.596
I mean,
we walk into work,

01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:41.076
our job,

01:24:41.163 --> 01:24:42.512
and somebody goes,
"You want a shot?"

01:24:42.599 --> 01:24:44.905
Well, that doesn't
happen at IBM.

01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:46.690
You don't show up
at 9:00 in the morning,

01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:49.171
there's a guy with a bottle
of Peach Schnapps.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:50.824
"Hey, you in?"

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:53.653
So if you are leaning
toward any bad habits,

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.395
this is the perfect lifestyle
to engage in,

01:24:56.482 --> 01:24:58.136
but again,
rule follower.

01:24:58.223 --> 01:24:59.398
Control, I'm never gonna--

01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:00.878
I'm not shooting
heroin with you

01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:02.358
by the trash can
at 9:00.

01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:04.186
What, are you crazy?

01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:05.839
I do try to,
on some level,

01:25:05.926 --> 01:25:09.408
even if I'm telling a joke
about a gaping butthole,

01:25:09.495 --> 01:25:12.063
I do try to have it
colored by the fact

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:14.892
that I like people,

01:25:14.979 --> 01:25:16.763
I enjoy being alive,

01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:18.591
and, um...

01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:20.289
[Pollak]
Gratefully, you don't
have a gaping butthole.

01:25:20.376 --> 01:25:21.768
Yeah, not yet,
you know?

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:23.596
You know,
the self-loathing darkness

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:25.642
where you wake up 3:00
in the morning and kinda go--

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:27.122
but this is
an old Steve Martin bit

01:25:27.209 --> 01:25:28.645
where you just kind of,
like, go in,

01:25:28.732 --> 01:25:30.516
you sprinkle
some water on your face,

01:25:30.603 --> 01:25:32.388
and you look at yourself in
the mirror, and you say...

01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:35.434
"What is
happening to me?!"

01:25:35.521 --> 01:25:38.220
You know?[Pollak laughing]

01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:40.135
"Why am I in this hotel?"

01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:42.702
By the way, I figured that out
two-and-a-half years ago.

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:44.922
[Pollak]
That's right.
That would be...

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:48.882
54-and-a-half years of living
in self-loathing darkness,

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:50.667
so you get past that,

01:25:50.754 --> 01:25:53.757
and things seem to be a little
bit better, don't they?

01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:58.240
I had a panic attack on stage
once that was terrifying,

01:25:58.327 --> 01:25:59.806
because I did not know

01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:02.157
there was such a thing
as panic attacks.

01:26:02.244 --> 01:26:05.421
The thought of
having to be on stage

01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:08.250
for another 50 minutes

01:26:08.337 --> 01:26:10.426
and then two more hours
after that

01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:13.603
was unendurable,

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:17.433
and I walked offstage,

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.783
and I walked
out of the club,

01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:21.437
and the club owner was
in the lobby,

01:26:21.524 --> 01:26:23.265
and he looked
at me, and he went,

01:26:23.352 --> 01:26:24.396
"Who's on stage
right now?"

01:26:24.483 --> 01:26:26.268
I just went, "No one."

01:26:26.355 --> 01:26:28.705
And I walked into
the men's room,

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:31.142
and I just stood
in the stall for a minute,

01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:34.450
and it kinda passed.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:37.279
Then I finally get
to the right doctor,

01:26:37.366 --> 01:26:38.976
who said,

01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:41.370
"I think you might want
to take a pill for this."

01:26:41.457 --> 01:26:43.937
And he just--

01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:46.375
"Yeah, panic disorder.

01:26:46.462 --> 01:26:47.985
People have it."

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:50.335
My sort of hippy-dippy
friends would say, like,

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:52.337
"You know, you're still
feeling the anxiety,

01:26:52.424 --> 01:26:55.297
you're just
masking it with medication."

01:26:55.384 --> 01:26:58.125
And I go, "Yes."

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:02.956
That's what it says on the label
of the prescription, "masks."

01:27:03.043 --> 01:27:04.654
In the winter,
I still feel the cold.

01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:08.266
I mask it with
a coat.

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:09.920
Because I'm a coward.

01:27:10.007 --> 01:27:13.184
I wrote "Swingers" after
suffering from a breakup.

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:15.534
That aspect was
autobiographical,

01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:19.321
and through the experience
of writing that thing

01:27:19.408 --> 01:27:21.845
alone in my rented room,

01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:24.500
I was pouring my heart and soul
into this thing,

01:27:24.587 --> 01:27:26.850
and then...

01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:28.852
By the time
I had to perform it,

01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:32.247
I wasn't really connected
with that pain anymore,

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:34.727
and then,
by the time I showed it,

01:27:34.814 --> 01:27:36.642
there was laughter
and the opposite

01:27:36.729 --> 01:27:39.254
of the feeling
I felt in the breakup,

01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:41.517
because I was now connected

01:27:41.604 --> 01:27:44.128
with these thousands
of people around the world,

01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:47.131
and everybody who saw it
or a screening I went to,

01:27:47.218 --> 01:27:50.352
now I felt like I was
part of a collective,

01:27:50.439 --> 01:27:51.875
I felt like I was-- people
understood me,

01:27:51.962 --> 01:27:54.356
I understood them,
and we shared a heart.

01:27:54.443 --> 01:27:56.575
I've done a lot of plays in
Midtown, Broadway and whatever,

01:27:56.662 --> 01:27:58.273
and, like,
I'll do the walk,

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.493
I'll do the 40-block walk,
full talking to myself,

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.278
full talking to myself,

01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:05.323
reliving shit that
just happened,

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:08.370
having full conversations with
people that I wanted to have,

01:28:08.457 --> 01:28:10.459
"Fucker, why the fuck
do you keep doing this?"

01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:12.069
Something like that,
you know,

01:28:12.156 --> 01:28:13.636
you want to have that
conversation, you don't,

01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:15.333
you have it with the other guy,
and you're like,

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.421
"I swear, tomorrow,
I'm gonna say something."

01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:17.944
It doesn't happen,
but I--

01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:19.555
I get it all out,
like, in 40 blocks,

01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:21.339
walking and talking.

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:23.428
Nobody fucking
bothers me.

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:25.474
I think artists are,
you know, brave people,

01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:26.649
but we're fucked up.

01:28:26.736 --> 01:28:29.129
Yes, there are...

01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:32.698
really fucked-up people
in show business.

01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:34.439
The people
that talk about

01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:36.572
how fucked-up people are
in show business,

01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:39.923
have they met anyone
that's not in show business?

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.490
The same pain,

01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:44.101
the same suffering,
the same angst,

01:28:44.188 --> 01:28:45.320
the same
tortures,

01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:46.625
the same doubts,

01:28:46.712 --> 01:28:48.932
the same misery are
all there.

01:28:49.019 --> 01:28:51.543
In show business,

01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:55.286
you show what
you're feeling.

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:58.115
So, yes, they show
the angst,

01:28:58.202 --> 01:29:00.857
but they're showing
the angst of humanity,

01:29:00.944 --> 01:29:02.989
the angst
that we all share.

01:29:03.076 --> 01:29:05.209
If you had a comic

01:29:05.296 --> 01:29:07.733
that truly had
experiences

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.736
that were
outside of the realm

01:29:10.823 --> 01:29:13.304
of the general
humanity,

01:29:13.391 --> 01:29:15.045
no one would
go see them.

01:29:15.132 --> 01:29:19.354
Right now, I'm still
making the decision of,

01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:21.312
am I a comedian?

01:29:21.399 --> 01:29:23.836
I shuffle
the job title

01:29:23.923 --> 01:29:26.796
on the web with what
I do first,

01:29:26.883 --> 01:29:29.189
depending on
what I'm doing.

01:29:29.276 --> 01:29:31.235
And I'm a comedian,
and I'm proud to be a comedian.

01:29:31.322 --> 01:29:33.455
It took me
a really long time

01:29:33.542 --> 01:29:34.717
to take out the word
"American"

01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:36.762
and put "comedian."

01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:40.157
Don't you take my truck,
I'm a comedian.

01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:42.333
You know, we'll do
a montage at the end.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.030
[Pollak chuckling]

01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:47.730
It can be viewed as
questionable babysitting.

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:49.775
I'm in charge of
these people,

01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:51.603
but I shouldn't be.

01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:54.171
But I am, and let's just hope
it doesn't get weird.

01:29:54.258 --> 01:29:56.391
To this day,
I don't know what happened.

01:29:56.478 --> 01:29:58.088
I don't. I don't.
All of a sudden,

01:29:58.175 --> 01:30:00.960
it went from them
loving me to them hating me.

01:30:01.047 --> 01:30:04.311
But maybe I'm not that funny,
so I'm not that fucked-up.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.922
That's the consolation.

01:30:06.009 --> 01:30:08.359
The best type
of conversation you'll have,

01:30:08.446 --> 01:30:10.361
you're talking,

01:30:10.448 --> 01:30:12.581
and someone's
listening, right?

01:30:12.668 --> 01:30:15.018
It's the narcissist
fantasy.

01:30:15.105 --> 01:30:18.456
Don't be--
don't ruin it for everybody.

01:30:18.543 --> 01:30:19.892
[Pollak]
With your feelings.

01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:21.459
Exactly.

01:30:21.546 --> 01:30:24.506
This whole thing about
feelings, I just--

01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:25.724
I couldn't absorb it.

01:30:25.811 --> 01:30:26.856
[Pollak]
Yeah.

01:30:26.943 --> 01:30:28.684
Even though I had them.

01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:31.338
I made a girl cry
in college.

01:30:35.778 --> 01:30:37.519
[muffled laugh]

01:30:37.606 --> 01:30:39.216
I feel bad.

01:30:39.303 --> 01:30:41.697
I'm a horrible person.
They hate me.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:43.525
This is the end
of my life and career.

01:30:43.612 --> 01:30:44.874
I will never recover.

01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:46.353
They will never
like me again.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:47.920
I'm stupid, I'm--

01:30:48.007 --> 01:30:50.923
It's all of that
put together.

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:52.534
I used to be
a smart-ass in class,

01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:54.405
and I'd get sent to the
principal's office.

01:30:54.492 --> 01:30:55.754
And now...

01:30:55.841 --> 01:30:56.886
[Pollak]
You get sent to the bank.

01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:58.540
I get sent
to the bank.

01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:01.194
If the ego is making
the decisions,

01:31:01.281 --> 01:31:04.415
then you're never
gonna be satisfied.

01:31:04.502 --> 01:31:07.244
It's also hard
to imagine

01:31:07.331 --> 01:31:09.202
somebody...

01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:15.557
anywhere near normal writing
the great American novel,

01:31:15.644 --> 01:31:17.863
you know, I think.

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:22.564
Exposing the absurdity
of life, like,

01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:24.827
its preposterous
pointlessness.

01:31:24.914 --> 01:31:26.263
Not just like,
"Oh, it's a powerful drug,

01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:27.743
and you can make a lot
of people laugh,

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:29.179
and it feels great
to make people laugh.

01:31:29.266 --> 01:31:31.616
Comedy can save your
fucking life.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:33.749
I think artists are,
you know, brave people,

01:31:33.836 --> 01:31:35.751
but we're fucked up,
and, like...

01:31:35.838 --> 01:31:37.100
You know,
it's the difference between,

01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:38.623
like, us,

01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:40.582
and the guy who,
you know,

01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:42.758
kills a whole
bunch of people,

01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:45.761
you know, is not that wide.
It's very small.

01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:48.807
I don't believe you have
to be miserable to be funny,

01:31:48.894 --> 01:31:50.940
but I do believe you have
to be miserable

01:31:51.027 --> 01:31:53.420
to be really funny.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.205
I hate to say it,
I really do,

01:31:55.292 --> 01:31:57.729
I just think you're funnier
when you're miserable.

01:31:57.816 --> 01:31:59.514
I think you are,
I think it's funny.

01:31:59.601 --> 01:32:01.646
You laugh at how miserable
you were,

01:32:01.733 --> 01:32:02.865
but I think that's
what makes you laugh,

01:32:02.952 --> 01:32:04.214
'cause you're just going,

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.042
"This is awful,
my life is awful."

01:32:06.129 --> 01:32:07.696
And then you're like,
"Wait, my life is awful,"

01:32:07.783 --> 01:32:09.132
and you're like,
Yeah, that was awful,

01:32:09.219 --> 01:32:10.525
and that was bad.

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:11.830
And then you're,
like, you're through

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:13.832
your whole
Mead notebook of,

01:32:13.919 --> 01:32:15.878
like, all these-- "Oh, my God,
that was awful, too."

01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:17.836
And you get excited
how awful things were

01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:20.926
because that feeds you,
it feeds the beast.

01:32:21.013 --> 01:32:22.885
So, sadly,
I would--

01:32:22.972 --> 01:32:24.495
I don't know,
I think-- I think,

01:32:24.582 --> 01:32:27.063
Yes, you have to be miserable
to be funny.

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:29.195
But there's ways
you can turn it on and off,

01:32:29.282 --> 01:32:30.806
and the older you get,
you'll figure

01:32:30.893 --> 01:32:33.939
how to enjoy
parts of your life.

01:32:34.026 --> 01:32:35.201
Yeah, I wish I had
a better answer.

01:32:35.288 --> 01:32:36.594
So sad.

01:32:36.681 --> 01:32:38.944
It's so true,
oh, my God.

01:32:39.031 --> 01:32:40.642
[Pollak]
Cut, great.

01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:42.469
Genius, perfect.
Perfect.
