00:07.590 --> 00:09.009
Spin-off!

00:09.092 --> 00:11.636
Is there any word more thrilling
to the human soul?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.096
Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.598
You may remember me
from such TV spin-offs

00:15.682 --> 00:19.602
as "Son of Sanford and Son"
and "After Mannix."

00:19.686 --> 00:21.771
I'm here at the Museum
of TV and Television

00:21.855 --> 00:24.566
with a real treat
for Simpsons fans, if any,

00:24.649 --> 00:27.402

we present the...

00:29.029 --> 00:30.405

00:40.623 --> 00:42.834
Not long ago,
the Fox Network approached

00:42.917 --> 00:45.420
the producers of "The Simpsons"
with a simple request:

00:45.503 --> 00:48.131
35 new shows
to fill a few holes

00:48.214 --> 00:49.674
in their programming lineup.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.676
That's a pretty daunting task,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.762
and the producers
weren't up to it.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.765
Instead, they churned out
three Simpsons spin-offs,

00:56.848 --> 00:59.059
transplanting
already popular characters

00:59.142 --> 01:01.770
into new locales
and situations.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.772
First up,
a gritty crime drama

01:03.855 --> 01:06.775
starring Springfield's
beloved police chief Wiggum.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.526
Keep at least one eye open,

01:08.610 --> 01:10.320
'cause his best friends,
<i>The Simpsons,</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.614
just might pop in
to wish him luck.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.574
Let's us wish him luck, too.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.867
Good luck, Wiggum.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.576
Old Swampy.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.703
I still don't understand,
Clancy.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.123
Why give up your job
as a small-town police chief

02:03.206 --> 02:05.375
to set up a detective shop
in New Orleans?

02:05.458 --> 02:07.710
Oh, lots of reasons,
I suppose.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.004
Got kicked off the force
for one thing.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.631
For massive corruption.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.966
-For massive corr-- Exactly.
-Yeah.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.135
As for me,
I was born and bred here

02:15.218 --> 02:16.803
in the mean streets
of "N'awlins."

02:16.886 --> 02:18.471
Oh, sure, I left briefly

02:18.555 --> 02:20.473
to take that principal's job
in Springfield,

02:20.557 --> 02:22.225
but in my heart,

02:22.308 --> 02:23.893
I've always been
a small-time hustler.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.354
I know. That's precisely
why I hired you

02:26.437 --> 02:28.106
as my leg man,
Skinny Boy.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.066
I want you to put the word out.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.902
Chief Wiggum is here
to clean up this crime dump.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.072
Bleh.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.825
Hmm? Looks like you've already
got an enemy, Chief.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.078
You know, folks around here don't
much care for law-and-order types.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.165
Is that right? Well, maybe they'll
change their minds

02:45.248 --> 02:48.126
once I arrest them for throwing skulls
all over my floor.

02:49.669 --> 02:50.628
Hmm.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.758
Aw, man, what a day.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
It's no cakewalk
being a single parent

02:57.927 --> 02:59.846
juggling a career and a family

02:59.929 --> 03:02.265
like so many juggling balls.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.683
Two, I suppose.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.311
Daddy, these rubber pants
are hot.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.105
You wear them
until you learn, son.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.690
Mwah.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.907
-I gar-ohn-tee...
-Will you stop saying that?

03:18.990 --> 03:21.993
So, Skinner, who do you figure threw
that skull through my window?

03:22.076 --> 03:23.828
What's the word on the street?

03:23.912 --> 03:25.496
Well, to be honest, Chief,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.999
I haven't lived in
New Orleans for 42 years.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.084
Although...

03:30.168 --> 03:32.503
according to an article
I read in "Parade" magazine,

03:32.587 --> 03:35.798
a criminal by the name
of "Big Daddy" runs this town.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.508
Big Daddy, eh?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.802
Well, he won't feel so big

03:39.886 --> 03:42.347
if he messes
with Chief Wiggum, P.I. again,

03:42.430 --> 03:44.766
which I sincerely doubt
he will.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.729

03:59.489 --> 04:02.492

04:02.575 --> 04:04.160
Hey.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.162
Oh, God!

04:18.716 --> 04:20.927
Lucky for you,
this was just a warning gator.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.012
The next one won't be corked.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.014
Listen up, Big Daddy!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.349
You don't scare me.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.351
I'm three steps ahead of you.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.186
Oh, Chief?
Your boy has been kidnapped.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.105
Oh, God!

04:35.441 --> 04:38.319
Big Daddy's trademark
calling card.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.072
See, it's right here
inside the skull.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.494
Looks like we've got our first case ever,
Skinny Boy,

04:46.577 --> 04:48.746
and this time it's personal.

04:50.915 --> 04:54.168

04:57.964 --> 05:00.091
It's me, Chief.
I'm on the other extension.

Now, you listen up,
<i>mon ami,</i>

05:01.301 --> 05:02.719

Charles Daddy.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.266
Big Daddy! What have you done
with my boy, Daddy?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.727
Ah, the boy is fine, so far.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.187
I taught him
to play the spoons.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.732
If you ever want to see
that boy again,

I suggest you
leave town today, heah?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.986
(dial tone)

05:20.069 --> 05:22.155
Huh. Sounded like
some sort of party

05:22.238 --> 05:23.906
going on in the background.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.950
Are there any parties today,
Skinner?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.827
Nah. It's not really
a party town,

05:27.910 --> 05:30.788
though if I remember correctly,
they occasionally hold

05:30.872 --> 05:33.124

Mardi Gras, man.
When the Big Easy calls,

06:02.653 --> 06:04.322
you got to accept the charges.

Golly, I'd love to chat,
but my son's been kidnapped.

You haven't seen him,

Caucasian male between the ages
of six and ten,

It's stolen.

That's the Louisiana
Governor's Mansion.

<i>Moe near now.</i>

11:53.546 --> 11:54.672
<i>Go near Moe.</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:56.632
-What?
-Go near Moe.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.176
I'd say that's
a pretty strong endorsement.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.845
So how about you and me
go out sometime?

12:00.928 --> 12:02.263
You know, out back.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.641
-(buzzing)
-I mean, out to dinner...

12:05.725 --> 12:07.101
at a fancy
French restaurant?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.311
<i>-Bing!</i>
-Sounds great.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.106
And if this love tester
is as accurate as it looks,

12:12.189 --> 12:14.442
maybe we'll be having
breakfast, too.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.527
AUDIENCE: Wooo!

12:16.610 --> 12:18.279
You did it, Grampa.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.572
You really are a love expert.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.073
<i>Dang right.</i>

12:21.157 --> 12:23.284
<i>Fact is, I invented kissing.</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:25.077
<i>It was during World War I,</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:26.495
<i>and they were looking</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:27.747
<i>for a new way</i>
<i>to spread germs.</i>

12:34.754 --> 12:37.339
(canned laughter)

12:37.423 --> 12:40.426
Sorry, Grampa, but I got
to stash you in the bathroom,

12:40.509 --> 12:42.511
so Betty won't get wise to us.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.933
<i>This is not the evening</i>
<i>I envisioned.</i>

12:48.017 --> 12:49.477
Oh, jeez, she just got here.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.645
Give me some advice, quick!

12:51.729 --> 12:54.148
<i>You know, just be sweet,</i>
<i>pour on the honey, you know...</i>

12:54.231 --> 12:56.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah, romantic.

12:56.358 --> 13:00.654
Ain't sunshine pretty,
ain't flowers stupid, I got you.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.490
<i>(sighs)</i>

13:02.573 --> 13:05.534
<i>I've suffered so long,</i>
<i>why can't I die?</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:07.328
You know what's great
about you, Betty

13:07.411 --> 13:08.954
is you're letting
your looks go gracefully.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.498
You're not all hung-up

13:10.581 --> 13:13.292
on looking attractive
and desirable.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.877
It's just so rare
and refreshing.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.172
So, Moe, tell me
a little about yourself.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.634
Myself... uh... uh, jeez.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.053
Um, I got to go
to the can again.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.555
-Huh?
-I got the runs.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.476
(grunting)

13:30.559 --> 13:32.436
Hey! Get away from that!
Leave him alone!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.939
-It said I was gay.
-(canned laughter)

13:35.022 --> 13:36.774
You all right, Grampa?

13:36.857 --> 13:41.695
<i>Oh... Daisy, Daisy...</i>

13:41.779 --> 13:45.491
<i>give me your answer true...</i>

13:45.574 --> 13:47.660
will you quit your clowning?
I need help here.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.539
<i>Whoa, tell her her rump's</i>

13:51.622 --> 13:53.958
<i>as big as the queen's</i>

13:54.041 --> 13:57.795
<i>and twice as fragrant.</i>

13:57.878 --> 13:58.879
Okay.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.678
You are absolutely,
positively the dumbest

14:05.761 --> 14:07.721
haunted love tester
that I have ever met.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.015
(gasps)

14:10.099 --> 14:11.767
What is going on in here?

14:11.851 --> 14:15.312
Um, uh... Oh, gah...

14:15.396 --> 14:17.982
I might as well
come clean with you.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.817
I ain't too good
at talking to women,

14:19.900 --> 14:21.902
and I really wanted
to do you,

14:21.986 --> 14:24.613
so I brought along
the love tester to help me.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.115
As you may have guessed,

14:26.198 --> 14:27.449
it's inhabited by the ghost

14:27.533 --> 14:29.243
of my friend's dead father.

14:29.326 --> 14:35.291
Why, you conniving, devious,
monstrous, despicable...

14:35.374 --> 14:37.251
sweet, little angel.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.920
Look, Betty, if you just
give me a chance-- What?

14:40.004 --> 14:43.591
I can't believe you went
to all that trouble for me.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.676

15:36.018 --> 15:38.562
to show off
the full range of their talents.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.440
Unfortunately, one family member
didn't want that chance

15:41.523 --> 15:43.192
and refused to participate

15:43.275 --> 15:45.152
but thanks
to some creative casting,
