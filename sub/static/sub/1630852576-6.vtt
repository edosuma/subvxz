Zoey:
<i>Previously on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

00:04.438 --> 00:06.940
reporter: (on television)
<i>Savannah Dillon disappeared</i>
<i>30 years ago tonight,</i>

00:07.075 --> 00:09.777
<i>following a camp dance</i>
<i>at the historic Tremont Hotel.</i>

00:09.910 --> 00:12.046
Harper:
<i>So all we have to do</i>
<i>is stay with her</i>

00:12.180 --> 00:13.947
until we're positive
she's safe in her bunk,

00:14.082 --> 00:15.383
while keeping
an eye on Jess.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.251
Tonight's the anniversary
of Savannah's disappearance,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.989
which means she'll probably
be haunting this place
extra hard.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.991
Wyatt:
<i>We can always</i>
<i>give her something.</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:24.925
So what do we do now?

00:25.059 --> 00:25.559
We wait.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.230
Your sister is going through
a challenging time right now.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.231
Keep an eye on her, okay?

00:31.332 --> 00:32.900
Do you want to come
to the dance with me tonight?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.836
I can always use
a partner in crime.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.440
Harper:
<i>Listen, Jess...</i>

00:39.573 --> 00:42.476
You're not planning
on doing anything tonight,
are you?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.646
It's time.
Side A, please.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.350
Savannah:
I love this song.
Do you want to dance?

00:49.483 --> 00:50.784
Jess, everything okay?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.654
You knew I was going
to ask Ben to dance,

00:53.787 --> 00:56.157
and you had Savannah
ask him first
to humiliate me.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.558
This isn't over, Hermione.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.194
(intense music playing)

01:09.637 --> 01:11.505
(indistinct chatter)

01:14.375 --> 01:15.576
camp counselor:
Did anyone hear that?

01:16.477 --> 01:17.711
Hey, is somebody out there?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.348
Who do you think
it is?

01:20.481 --> 01:21.582
Moss man?

01:21.715 --> 01:22.683
(Ben chuckles)

01:22.816 --> 01:23.884
Could be.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.086
He still haunts
these woods.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.590
That's just
a silly legend.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.091
Not what I heard.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.862
Amanda saw his muddy prints
near the springs last week.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.830
Here's what
you guys should know.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.167
About a hundred years ago,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.268
a mutant creature lived...

01:40.401 --> 01:41.335
Campfire is almost over.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.772
Whatever's gonna happen,
it's gonna be soon.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.874
Yeah, we cannot
let Savannah
out of our sight.

01:47.007 --> 01:47.575
Harper:
Or my mom.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.145
I still can't believe
how mad she got
at the dance tonight.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.913
When he spotted
his next victim...

01:53.981 --> 01:55.249
he'd slowly...

01:56.217 --> 01:57.385
creep closer...

01:58.952 --> 02:04.525
and closer...

02:08.262 --> 02:09.096
-And then--
-(screams)

02:09.230 --> 02:10.731
(all screaming)

02:10.864 --> 02:12.400
(laughing)

02:15.336 --> 02:20.073
Now, that's what you get
for putting itching powder
in my bed.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.377
Okay, people, finish up.
It's getting late.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.983
-girl 1: Good night.
-girl 2: Good night, Sarah.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.187
Didn't anyone ever tell you
ghosts aren't real?

02:34.255 --> 02:35.856
Oh, poor baby.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.858
I hope you don't have
scary dreams.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.797
You had chocolate.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.769
-(chuckles)
-Thanks.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.177
(tense music playing)

02:57.311 --> 02:58.412
Oh, no.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.113
And they're gone.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.318
(theme music playing)

03:27.040 --> 03:29.109
(tense music playing)

03:32.079 --> 03:33.814
We only looked away
for a second.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.015
They couldn't have
gotten far.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.592
Hey, do you mind?

03:45.158 --> 03:46.727
No dudes. Camp rules.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.829
Did Savannah or Jess
come back here?

03:48.962 --> 03:50.498
-No.
-You sure?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.400
You didn't see them
walking back
from the bonfire?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.066
Maybe in the restroom?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.837
How many times
can a hummingbird flap
its wings in a second?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.972
This is
a little more important
than "Trivia Quizzle."

03:59.106 --> 04:00.308
Griffin:
Don't bother.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.542
They don't know.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.280
We're running
out of time.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.049
Alright, um, stay calm
and think.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.285
If you were Savannah,
what would you
be doing right now?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.152
I don't know.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.087
I guess, um...

04:14.221 --> 04:15.556
pulling a prank
with your dad.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.558
All right, uh...

04:17.691 --> 04:18.859
So let's check the hotel.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.127
There's plenty
of targets there.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.106
Sweet dreams, little ones.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.582
Okay, she's gone.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.455
Can't we have
a sÃ©ance tomorrow?

04:48.456 --> 04:51.024
Today is the anniversary
of Savannah's death.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.926
Tomorrow is just tomorrow.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.597
This is our best chance
to get proof she's real.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.898
Ready?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.302
What?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.037
It's gonna be
cold in the basement.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.648
This is definitely
the right night
to summon a spirit.

05:28.161 --> 05:42.676
(wind whooshing)

05:55.589 --> 05:56.690
(gasps)

05:56.824 --> 05:57.825
(exhales)

06:04.398 --> 06:05.232
(yelps)

06:08.869 --> 06:10.003
Sorry.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.472
Didn't mean to scare you.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.043
What were you doing outside?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.411
Oh. I...

06:18.245 --> 06:18.979
heard a noise.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.749
Thought a tree
might have fallen or something.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.719
-Was everything okay?
-Yeah.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.755
Yeah.

06:30.057 --> 06:30.924
Here, I got this.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.106
I never did
anything to Jess.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.008
What's her beef
with me?

06:49.543 --> 06:52.012
Last year, everyone
was really into her.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.647
And now you're here...

06:54.615 --> 06:55.916
and you're--
you're different.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.084
And fun.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.019
(door opens)

06:59.152 --> 07:00.754
No, she's a total phony.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.990
You followed us?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.926
Because I knew
she'd bad mouth me.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.295
(scoffs)
I'm just sitting here,
minding my own business.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.997
(scoffs)
Give me a break.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.732
Everything you do
is to get attention.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.502
"Look how many pranks
I can pull.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.903
"Watch me sing and dance.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.639
I'm so brave,
I'm not afraid of anything."

07:19.339 --> 07:21.341
I'm not,
including you.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.844
Yeah?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.680
Then I dare you.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.684
Spend the rest of the night
in the basement...

07:31.284 --> 07:31.752
with the ghost.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.088
And whatever else
is lurking around the hotel.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.692
(chuckles)
Knew it! Coward.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.561
Jess, come on.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
Can't you see?
She's playing you.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.499
You don't know
anything about me.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.070
I know this.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.406
Everything would be better
if you were gone.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.122
-Any luck?
-Not a trace.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.725
This is bad, really bad.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.260
-Where else could she be?
-I don't know.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.095
(indistinct chatter)

08:16.129 --> 08:17.698
I can't believe
I didn't think of this sooner.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.000
-What?
-There's a treehouse
in the woods.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.602
It's like a hangout spot.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.970
I saw Savannah
go there earlier.

08:23.103 --> 08:23.971
Let's go then.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.676
Jess!

08:28.809 --> 08:29.877
Don't even talk to me.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.011
No, please.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.246
If this is about
what happened at the dance,

08:33.380 --> 08:35.048
you have to know,
I would never--

08:35.182 --> 08:37.250
Humiliate me
in front of Ben? Hmm?

08:37.384 --> 08:39.419
In front
of the entire camp?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.555
Uh, could we, uh...
Could we talk
about this later?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.290
Look, you have it
all wrong.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.792
I just want you
to be happy.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.861
Yeah? And why
would you want that?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.031
Uh, because you're...

08:52.199 --> 08:53.233
Because you, uh...

08:53.366 --> 08:54.902
You remind her
of someone.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.804
-Yes.
-Someone she likes.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.273
What is with you two?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.210
Is there a problem?

09:03.911 --> 09:04.912
Nope. All good.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.513
Yeah,
just hanging out.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.082
Um, actually, Becky,
there is.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.784
Lots of problems.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.720
Starting with these two.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.588
They're always around,
asking questions.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.889
They say they're guests,

09:16.023 --> 09:17.658
but I don't think they are.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.859
-Of course we are.
-Yeah, I mean--

09:18.992 --> 09:20.794
My dad stays
at The Tremont all the time.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.195
I mean, he'd move in
if he could.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.031
I've never even
seen their parents.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.233
Hmm.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.869
Let's go talk
to the manager.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.471
You know what?
Not necessary.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.341
Yeah, I think we'll just
get out of your way.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.710
Manger's office
is this way.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.180
Guess what?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.050
I feel much happier now.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.028
Names?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.396
Oh, um...

09:56.529 --> 09:58.465
James and, uh...

09:58.598 --> 09:59.599
Lily Potter.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.970
-Yours?
-Uh, Granger.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.339
Just...
Mr. and Mrs. Granger.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.441
They're weird that way.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.646
No Grangers. No Potters.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.383
Okay, no more games.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.818
You're not leaving this office

10:17.951 --> 10:19.887
until you tell us
how to contact your parents.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.799
I thought
you went to bed.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.300
Still have homework
to finish.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.168
It's taking forever.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.770
Well, you need
some help?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.306
How are you
at tracking

10:39.439 --> 10:41.108
"the migratory pattern
of geese"?

10:41.241 --> 10:44.544
(chuckles) Baby, I'm lucky
if I can keep track
of my car keys.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.780
Better get comfy.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.448
We could be here
all night.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.117
(snoring)

10:51.251 --> 10:52.619
What is that?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.554
Um... Nothing.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.023
It's just, uh...

10:56.857 --> 10:58.658
-Is that snoring?
-(switches off)

10:59.426 --> 11:01.494
Little-known fact,
geese snore.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.963
Topher...

11:03.096 --> 11:03.964
talk.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.134
(sighs)

11:07.267 --> 11:08.601
Well, um...

11:09.436 --> 11:10.537
you told me
to watch Harper, so...

11:11.839 --> 11:14.507
I put a mic in her room
to make sure
she stays out of trouble.

11:14.641 --> 11:15.776
You know, I told you
to make sure

11:15.909 --> 11:17.845
that your sister
didn't leave the house.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.747
I didn't ask you
to spy on her.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.681
Not in so many words.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.918
I'll go unplug the mic.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.419
Don't wake her.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.457
Oh, not a chance.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.829
-(sighing)
-(door closes)

11:49.409 --> 11:50.543
-(banging on door)
-Come on!

11:50.677 --> 11:51.478
(doorknob rattling)

11:52.245 --> 11:54.681
(sighs)
What are we gonna do?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.516
-(banging on metal)
-It's okay. I have an idea.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.819
Really? What happens
when they can't find
our parents?

11:59.619 --> 12:01.588
Won't matter.
We won't be here.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.624
Help me move this.
There's a door behind it.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.559
-There is?
-I think I know my own hotel.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.195
This is our laundry room now.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.104
Told ya.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.812
All right, coast is clear.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.016
Locker ninjas before
brilliant masterminds.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.052
-We need to go
to the treehouse.
-Yeah.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.987
camp counselor:
Hey! How did you get out?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.488
-Uh... This way.
-Yep.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.026
Hey! Stop! Hey!

12:39.159 --> 12:40.527
Wait. Get back here!

12:43.897 --> 12:45.132
You know,
in my third foster home,

12:46.199 --> 12:48.635
I actually did
sleep in a bedroom
in the basement.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.903
I was not scared at all.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.705
I could do that dare.
No sweat.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.509
You don't have
to prove anything
to Jess.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.013
I just hate when people say
I can't do something.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.715
And they say it a lot.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.887
You know what?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.588
I've got an idea.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.024
Let's camp out here tonight.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.027
Then I don't have to deal
with that Jess drama
until tomorrow.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.496
That would totally freak out
Becky and Keith.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.465
Only makes it more fun,
right?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.534
We got water, and look,

13:22.302 --> 13:23.904
half a box of vanilla wafers.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.738
Breakfast of champions.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.254
Well,
one thing's for sure,

13:41.388 --> 13:43.857
we found
the coldest ghost spot
in the house.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.894
Not looking
so silly now, huh?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.130
Let's just get
this sÃ©ance going.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.604
Oh, ghost of The Tremont,
hear our--

13:57.737 --> 13:58.805
Stop!

13:59.606 --> 14:00.540
What?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.475
I think you should
ask for Savannah,

14:02.609 --> 14:05.078
or else a bunch of other ghosts
might crash our sÃ©ance.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.386
Savannah,
we summon you.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.155
We come in peace.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.325
Please show yourself.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.333
Maybe she's busy?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.269
Your light!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.972
She's listening.

14:40.780 --> 14:41.915
We shouldn't have left.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.917
We didn't have a choice.
They were about to catch us.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.785
Yeah, but Savannah's
still back there.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.087
She could
still go missing.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.189
Yeah, or...

14:51.124 --> 14:52.592
she could be okay.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.726
How do you figure?

14:53.860 --> 14:54.694
Well...

14:55.428 --> 14:56.596
We shook things up tonight.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.598
Like...

14:58.731 --> 15:00.233
your mom lost it on us.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.768
Maybe that created
a ripple.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.339
Yeah, okay, and when
you talked Savannah
into going to the dance,

15:06.473 --> 15:07.874
maybe that
changed things too.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.209
Exactly!

15:09.342 --> 15:11.244
We could have altered things
just by being back there.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.412
Only one way
to find out.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.515
Zoey:
Savannah, if you can hear me,

15:15.648 --> 15:18.918
please, we ask you
to honor us
with your presence.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.921
Speak to us.
Walk among us.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.823
Show us a sign.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.558
Wyatt:
As long as
it's not too scary.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.128
We're both
really nice people

15:28.261 --> 15:30.230
and we just wanna be
your friends.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.100
Zoey:
Beloved Savannah,
we beseech you.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.934
We know you're here.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.903
We know you can hear us.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.371
Wyatt:
Show yourself.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.639
(can thuds, rattles)

15:39.772 --> 15:41.008
(both scream)

15:42.842 --> 15:44.411
-She's mad at us!
-Run!

15:45.112 --> 15:47.114
Dad! Help!
There's a ghost!

15:47.247 --> 15:48.615
Savannah's ghost!

15:50.150 --> 15:50.984
(door closes)

15:52.552 --> 15:54.654
They were still hunting
for Savannah's ghost.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.491
Which means
she's still dead.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.260
We didn't change
the past.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.963
Wait, there's hope.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.598
She wasn't found missing
until the morning.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.100
It's still night.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.203
We have to go back.
We can still save her.

16:11.138 --> 16:11.971
Yeah.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.673
(electricity buzzes)

16:22.682 --> 16:25.018
We should start
at the bunkhouse,
see if she got back.

16:25.152 --> 16:25.785
Okay.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.821
And if she's not there,
treehouse.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.198
-Hey, watch it!
-Sorry.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.800
It felt like
something pushed me.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.669
Pushed you?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.404
You don't think it was...

16:44.537 --> 16:45.472
Savannah?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.041
(whispering):
She's following us.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.379
(both scream)

16:53.080 --> 16:53.980
It's just me.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.783
Why aren't you in bed?

16:56.916 --> 16:58.285
Dad, we saw Savannah.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.586
She threw
a can of soup at us.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.653
And then
the lights went out.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.721
We know you don't
believe us, but--

17:01.854 --> 17:02.889
Where did you see her?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.125
The basement.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.260
So you do believe us.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.097
Sarah:
Kids? Ben? Here you are!

17:10.230 --> 17:12.465
What do you say
we brighten
this place up?

17:23.009 --> 17:24.377
Jess:
Everyone okay up here?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.213
(footsteps approaching)

17:30.049 --> 17:31.151
What happened to the lights?

17:31.284 --> 17:32.619
There's a power outage
all over town.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.721
Ah, this wind is crazy.

17:34.854 --> 17:35.855
I wouldn't go in there.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.490
She's sleeping.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.426
You know how she is
if you wake her up.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.830
(chuckles)
Well, I will be very quiet.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.568
Move.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.776
(tense music playing)

18:01.080 --> 18:02.482
(snoring sounds)

18:03.816 --> 18:04.784
Is she at The Tremont?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.327
(taps on camcorder)

18:14.461 --> 18:16.129
Why won't
this dumb thing play?

18:16.263 --> 18:19.199
Maybe Savannah's ghost
broke it so we can't prove
she exists.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.733
(continues tapping)

18:20.867 --> 18:23.570
(guitar music)

18:23.703 --> 18:25.572
No way Griffin's
still practicing.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.114
Savannah's ghost!

18:35.915 --> 18:37.217
She's in the computer!

18:37.350 --> 18:38.218
It's not a ghost.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.420
It's Griffin
faking out Mom and Dad.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.889
And now we know
his secret.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.691
(music continues)

18:47.294 --> 18:48.127
(switches off)

18:49.396 --> 18:50.730
Zoey: (over camcorder)
<i>We come in peace.</i>

18:50.863 --> 18:51.631
Hey, it's working!

18:51.764 --> 18:53.633
Zoey:
<i>Please show yourself.</i>

18:54.501 --> 18:56.569
-(can thuds, rattles)
-(both scream)

18:58.738 --> 19:00.707
Zoey:
<i>She's mad at us! Run!</i>

19:00.840 --> 19:02.175
You can't see the soup.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.845
(tape rewinding)

19:08.548 --> 19:09.582
See that?

19:10.717 --> 19:11.818
Wyatt:
What is it?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.554
Maybe... a head?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.357
I don't see
eyes or a nose.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.259
Ghosts don't
all have faces.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.027
And look
where the head thing is.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.197
-Over the table?
-Uh-huh.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.932
Right where
we summoned her,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.267
by name.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.303
It worked!

19:30.437 --> 19:32.872
We did it.
We made contact.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.248
Wait.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.883
The portal
didn't work.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.719
When I went through,
I didn't feel a jolt.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.290
We failed.
Savannah's gone forever.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.726
What are you two
doing out here?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.061
The power's out
all over town.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.129
And don't even think
about lying.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.468
(ominous music playing)

20:41.040 --> 20:43.042
(door creaking)

21:02.228 --> 21:03.363
Hello?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.732
(tense music playing)

21:10.503 --> 21:13.440
Wyatt:
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

21:13.573 --> 21:15.708
-We'll start with grounded.
-Same for you, Harper.

21:15.842 --> 21:16.709
I need your help.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.711
-No way.
-Please!

21:18.845 --> 21:20.279
Harper:
<i>All I bought us</i>
<i>was 10 minutes.</i>

21:20.413 --> 21:21.514
You ready?

21:21.648 --> 21:22.515
Let's do this.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.486
We need to find out
what happened to Savannah
after the campfire.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.020
Griffin:
You were with her
last night, right?

21:28.154 --> 21:29.188
We-- We all were.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.257
-Is Harper here?
-Of course not.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.959
Jess:
Listen, I think that
they've run off together.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.727
I think we need
to call the police.
