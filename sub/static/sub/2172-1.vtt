03:25.700 --> 03:27.759
Go, go! Move it, move it!

03:34.309 --> 03:36.402
Let's go.

03:37.412 --> 03:39.539
- Let's go!
- There's four of you.

03:39.614 --> 03:43.744
- You can count. I'm impressed. Drive.
- Rule one: Never change the deal.

03:43.819 --> 03:48.119
Deal was transportation for three men
with a combined weight of 254 kilos.

03:48.223 --> 03:50.919
Yeah? Well, this is a new deal.

03:50.992 --> 03:54.621
An extra 80 kilos means we
won't make it on the gas I allotted.

03:54.729 --> 03:57.823
- We'll stop for more gas.
- Every stop we make exposes us.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.834
Every exposure increases
the risk of getting caught.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.303
An extra 80 kilos means the shock
absorbers I installed for this job

04:04.406 --> 04:08.399
won't allow us to outmaneuver
any police that might be chasing us,

04:08.476 --> 04:11.968
which means, if there is a chase,
we lose our advantage,

04:12.080 --> 04:14.571
increasing the chance of getting caught.

04:14.649 --> 04:18.642
I don't want to get caught.
You don't want to get caught.

04:18.753 --> 04:21.084
Drive the car or catch a bullet to the brains!

04:21.156 --> 04:23.818
- Then who drives?
- Shoot this asshole! I drive!

04:23.925 --> 04:27.417
Not without the ignition code you won't.

04:32.033 --> 04:37.335
Three men, 254 kilos. That was the deal.

04:44.212 --> 04:49.616
- Three men. 254 kilos.
- Seat belts.

05:32.594 --> 05:34.687
See what I mean about the shocks?

05:40.235 --> 05:42.066
Now it's time.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.574
Look out! Get out of the way!

05:57.919 --> 06:00.012
Wrong way!

06:01.056 --> 06:02.614
Stop, Marcel, stop!

06:04.960 --> 06:07.053
Move away!

06:26.448 --> 06:28.939
Yes!

06:30.885 --> 06:33.149
Go, go, go!

06:33.888 --> 06:35.321
Oh, merde.

06:47.669 --> 06:49.796
Shit.

07:20.301 --> 07:23.930
If you don't mind, I just
conditioned the leather back there.

07:25.707 --> 07:28.505
- Take us to the drop point.
- Not yet.

07:46.728 --> 07:48.025
The cops!

07:48.563 --> 07:51.828
What are you doing?
Don't stop now! Do something!

07:51.900 --> 07:53.959
- Come on!
- What are you thinking?

07:56.671 --> 07:58.798
Go! Go! Go!

08:00.175 --> 08:02.143
Do it! Now!

08:26.334 --> 08:28.393
Your gun, please.

09:20.288 --> 09:24.054
Police! Stop! Stop! Police!

09:56.958 --> 10:00.519
- You gave me too much.
- I need you to take us to Avignon.

10:01.796 --> 10:04.356
The deal was this far, no further.

10:04.465 --> 10:06.865
The deal is the deal. Rule number one.

10:06.968 --> 10:09.459
- Rules are meant to be broken.
- Not mine.

10:12.807 --> 10:15.275
Let's go.

10:15.343 --> 10:19.939
Get in the car. Come on! Hurry! Move it!

11:06.060 --> 11:08.324
Where's your yellow card?

11:08.396 --> 11:11.695
I must've left it back in Nam, at the base.

11:11.766 --> 11:14.667
They all say that. Left it in Nam on the base.

11:14.736 --> 11:17.864
Let me show you what we do
to people who forget it.

11:17.939 --> 11:20.339
Oh, no, please let go of me.

11:20.408 --> 11:24.401
You gotta be punished for this.
It's a fate far worse than death.

11:24.512 --> 11:28.573
Oh, hell. What could be
a fate worse than death?

11:31.386 --> 11:37.291
The Argentinean government commits
to meeting the IMF's target this year.

11:37.392 --> 11:42.022
Yesterday in Nice, four men robbed
the Alliance Investment Corporation.

11:42.096 --> 11:46.931
One man died on the sidewalk. The
others were apprehended this morning

11:47.035 --> 11:50.368
when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street in Avignon

11:50.438 --> 11:52.633
and ran into a taxicab.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.402
Police said, were it not for the poor driving,

11:55.476 --> 11:57.103
the 20 million euros in bearer bonds

11:57.211 --> 12:02.444
would have been cashed and gone
by this afternoon. In other news...

12:05.486 --> 12:11.391
I always say, the way a man treats
his car is how he treats himself.

12:11.726 --> 12:14.661
I'd say that's probably true, Inspector.

12:14.762 --> 12:17.663
You have a good sense of humor
for a foreigner.

12:17.765 --> 12:20.233
Like the French. Sly wit.

12:20.301 --> 12:24.397
Just the right amount of flavor.
Been out driving?

12:24.472 --> 12:28.670
Till they pass a law says I can't.
Want to come in for a coffee?

12:28.776 --> 12:31.802
Thank you, but I have a lot of stops to make.

12:31.913 --> 12:35.781
- 88, to be exact.
- That's a lot of stops.

12:35.850 --> 12:40.184
A lot of 1999 black BMW 735s

12:40.288 --> 12:43.951
with 0-6 in the license plates to check out.

12:44.025 --> 12:48.860
It's a very popular car with a certain
type down here. You've seen them.

12:48.963 --> 12:52.194
They come over from Italy
in very expensive suits,

12:52.300 --> 12:55.929
and young, pretty girls with
big jewelry and too much makeup.

12:56.003 --> 12:59.131
Very... Mafia.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.165
There was a robbery. A getaway.

13:03.177 --> 13:06.044
Some very fancy driving.

13:06.147 --> 13:10.777
Was someone in a 1999 black BMW 735?

13:10.852 --> 13:13.446
With 0-6 in the plates.

13:14.555 --> 13:17.888
- Have you been to the city lately?
- Not for a while.

13:17.992 --> 13:22.326
I love Nice. The food, the way they grill fish.

13:22.397 --> 13:25.730
No place else in France does it
the way they do in Nice.

13:25.833 --> 13:28.165
And the women...

13:28.236 --> 13:30.568
I prefer the women there.

13:30.671 --> 13:34.334
They are more... complicated

13:34.409 --> 13:38.641
than the local variety, don't you think?

13:39.981 --> 13:44.475
- I don't particularly like complicated.
- You like to keep it simple.

13:44.552 --> 13:47.521
- Why are you so interested?
- Oh, you know,

13:47.588 --> 13:52.082
ever since I'm a little boy,
military people have intrigued me.

13:52.193 --> 13:56.220
- I'm ex-military.
- I am an ex-little boy.

14:02.603 --> 14:05.265
Sure you don't have time for a coffee?

14:05.373 --> 14:09.036
Everything's always so neat with you,
Monsieur Frank.

14:11.345 --> 14:14.872
- Nothing ever out of place.
- I'll take that as a compliment,

14:14.949 --> 14:18.407
coming from a man who
pays attention to every detail.

14:20.421 --> 14:23.390
Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee.

14:25.593 --> 14:27.754
Door's always open to you.

14:39.774 --> 14:41.969
- Hugo gave me your number.
- Be brief.

14:42.076 --> 14:44.544
- I need a transporter.
- I'm listening.

14:51.252 --> 14:53.482
- One bag, that's it.
- Dimensions?

14:55.723 --> 14:58.817
- Be specific.
- One meter 50 by a half meter.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.092
- Weight.
- 50 kilos, not more.

15:06.133 --> 15:08.226
- Destination?
- 24, rue de Luxembourg.

15:08.302 --> 15:12.466
- You're delivering to Mr...
- Rule two: No names.

15:15.276 --> 15:19.610
- Time of pickup?
- Seven in the morning, at the front door.

15:21.682 --> 15:26.244
A package. 150 by 50, 50 kilos, 250 kilometers.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.757
Traveling within the speed limit,
one stop for refreshments: 40,000.

15:30.825 --> 15:34.921
Half now, half on delivery. Delivery
will be at noon. If no one's there,

15:34.996 --> 15:37.294
I'm not responsible. I'll leave the package.

15:37.365 --> 15:41.096
Once we make a deal, it cannot
be changed or renegotiated.

15:41.168 --> 15:44.695
- Another rule?
- That's rule number one.

15:45.206 --> 15:47.299
Do we have a deal?

15:52.880 --> 15:57.544
- You're very precise.
- Transportation is a precise business.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.372
Flat.

19:22.523 --> 19:24.013
Hi.

19:28.229 --> 19:32.029
Don't move. I won't hurt you, I'll
just make a hole so you can drink.

19:32.366 --> 19:34.857
Please. Please, come on.

19:48.415 --> 19:50.576
Come on. Drink.

19:54.088 --> 19:55.715
Slowly.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.259
OK, OK, that's enough.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.594
Good girl.

20:51.512 --> 20:56.176
I'll take the tape off. If you scream,
I'll have to kill you. Understand?

20:57.351 --> 20:59.444
I have to pee.

21:00.454 --> 21:02.854
You want me to do it in your car?

21:06.594 --> 21:08.619
OK.

21:17.104 --> 21:21.666
I'm gonna take my knife out, so don't
scream, OK? It's to cut you free.

21:25.512 --> 21:28.106
You don't need your mouth to pee.

21:35.022 --> 21:37.115
You have one minute.

21:39.660 --> 21:45.530
55, 54, 53, 52...

21:52.006 --> 21:54.167
Breaking the rules, Frank.

21:54.241 --> 21:56.334
Not good to break the rules.

22:04.585 --> 22:06.485
15!

22:09.857 --> 22:11.324
Seven.

22:14.395 --> 22:17.523
Two. Time's up.

22:21.001 --> 22:23.231
Don't make me drag you out.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.611
Shit!

23:22.229 --> 23:24.720
No, please! No.

23:25.899 --> 23:29.266
Rule three: Never look in the package.

23:29.336 --> 23:33.295
Hope you enjoyed your pee
cos it's your last on this trip.

24:02.169 --> 24:05.332
See what comes of breaking the rules?

24:47.381 --> 24:50.714
- You're late.
- Ran into a little problem.

24:52.086 --> 24:54.179
Nothin' serious?

24:57.925 --> 25:00.018
Nothin' serious.

25:12.372 --> 25:16.672
- You open the package?
- Rule three: Never open the package.

25:17.878 --> 25:21.336
I like that. Rules.

25:21.415 --> 25:24.748
You can't get anything done
in a world without rules.

25:24.852 --> 25:29.414
You're a foreigner, right?
Nice little thing you've got going for yourself.

25:29.523 --> 25:32.617
High class... good reputation.

25:33.927 --> 25:37.727
- I didn't get your name.
- Rule two: No names.

25:38.265 --> 25:39.755
Of course.

25:52.312 --> 25:54.405
You don't count it.

25:54.948 --> 25:57.109
Why? Should I?

25:57.217 --> 26:00.812
- No, no.
- That concludes the deal.

26:05.592 --> 26:09.221
You know, I was wondering

26:09.296 --> 26:13.096
if you wouldn't mind
transporting something for me.

26:13.634 --> 26:17.798
That's what you do, right?
You deliver, no questions asked.

26:21.975 --> 26:23.840
Why not?

26:26.914 --> 26:28.973
Weight?

26:31.118 --> 26:34.281
- Maybe a kilo.
- Destination?

26:34.354 --> 26:38.256
Grenoble. 306, rue de Lac. A Mr...

26:39.526 --> 26:43.326
Oh, right. I forgot. Rule two.

27:03.684 --> 27:05.777
I like him.

28:39.913 --> 28:41.608
What the f?

29:13.113 --> 29:14.978
Where is he?

31:41.127 --> 31:43.925
You're like dogshit. You're everywhere.

31:43.997 --> 31:48.593
Yeah. I know you wanna pee.
All you wanna do is pee.

32:16.263 --> 32:18.595
Useless piece of shit!

33:46.419 --> 33:49.013
I ask the questions, you answer them.

33:49.089 --> 33:52.183
No long speeches, just keep it simple. Got it?

33:55.562 --> 34:00.795
- Who are you?
- My name is Lai. I come from Jap...

34:01.801 --> 34:06.067
I ask the questions, you answer them.
Nothing more, nothing less.

34:06.139 --> 34:08.630
You wanna try again?

34:12.445 --> 34:14.811
- What kind of shit am I in?
- Deep shit.

34:14.914 --> 34:18.577
Very deep shit. Those guys...
Sorry. I won't say any...

34:49.315 --> 34:51.976
Bon appetit.

34:52.085 --> 34:55.485
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

34:55.588 --> 34:59.854
Can't think straight when I'm tired.
Good night's sleep, I see things better.

34:59.959 --> 35:02.154
- Can I leave?
- Be my guest.

36:57.477 --> 37:01.573
Hey. Are you comfortable?

37:02.982 --> 37:05.143
- Boss...
- Sh. Save your strength.

37:06.286 --> 37:08.914
Just tell me: Who did this?

37:10.757 --> 37:14.784
- The transporter.
- The transporter's dead.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.988
He's not.

37:22.635 --> 37:24.728
You believe me?

37:26.472 --> 37:28.440
I believe you.

37:28.508 --> 37:32.069
And the police... they were here?

37:33.980 --> 37:37.416
- You told 'em nothing, right?
- Right.

37:37.483 --> 37:39.815
Of course.

37:40.987 --> 37:43.512
You couldn't talk.

37:44.791 --> 37:46.782
Yeah.

37:50.129 --> 37:52.256
Let's keep it that way.

38:51.524 --> 38:56.518
I picked them from the garden outside.
I hope you don't mind.

38:57.597 --> 39:01.089
I didn't know if you like coffee or tea,
so I made both.

39:14.948 --> 39:19.408
I hope you like... madeleines.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.351
Try one.

39:25.024 --> 39:27.356
Careful. It's hot.

39:31.197 --> 39:33.256
Good?

39:38.271 --> 39:39.738
Let me.

39:41.307 --> 39:46.370
- I like it quiet in the morning.
- Yes, quiet in the morning. Me too.

39:46.446 --> 39:50.109
I'm the same way. I like very quiet.

39:52.251 --> 39:54.151
Sorry.

40:00.626 --> 40:03.390
Are you looking for milk?

40:03.463 --> 40:07.490
- There's milk at the door.
- Stay, stay. I'll go.

40:13.506 --> 40:15.599
Hi.

40:17.777 --> 40:20.974
- And you are?
- The new cook.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.173
Is Monsieur Frank in?

40:24.083 --> 40:26.517
Ah, Monsieur Frank.

40:27.153 --> 40:31.749
- Is your invitation for coffee still open?
- Sure, come on, please. Sit.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.521
- Madeleine?
- Homemade?

40:36.629 --> 40:39.291
Yes. I'll bring some more.

40:41.534 --> 40:44.196
My mother made fresh madeleines
every morning.

40:44.303 --> 40:48.603
I smell them and my whole childhood
comes back in one big flood.

40:48.674 --> 40:51.973
Like Proust. You ever read
Proust, Monsieur Frank?

40:52.045 --> 40:56.675
- No.
- It's fantastic. Memory like a steel trap.

40:56.783 --> 40:59.513
He would've been a great cop.
Real determined.

40:59.619 --> 41:01.678
- Milk?
- Please, milk.

41:02.789 --> 41:04.848
Thank you.

41:06.692 --> 41:10.492
I used to have a memory like Proust,
like a filing cabinet up there.

41:10.563 --> 41:13.293
I'd see something and remember it like that.

41:13.366 --> 41:15.800
Like license plates. I could see a plate

41:15.868 --> 41:20.134
and it was printed in my head.
Now I need all the help I can get

41:20.206 --> 41:23.232
remembering whose plate
goes with whose car.

41:23.342 --> 41:26.072
Like this one.

41:28.848 --> 41:32.011
- That's mine.
- Ah, memories.

41:32.085 --> 41:36.351
- So? Where's the rest of the car?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

41:36.422 --> 41:38.083
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

41:38.191 --> 41:40.091
I went to Frejus to pick up a few things.

41:40.193 --> 41:44.425
- When I came out of the market, it was...
- Gone. Did you report it?

41:44.530 --> 41:47.260
It was the first on my list
of things to do today.

41:47.366 --> 41:50.858
It's a long walk from Frejus.
How did you get home?

41:50.937 --> 41:53.531
I brought him.

41:54.073 --> 41:56.837
I saw him walking along the dark road.

41:56.909 --> 42:00.504
A risky thing, picking up
a stranger on a dark road.

42:01.781 --> 42:04.215
He had a kind face.

42:07.019 --> 42:09.954
- I didn't see a car outside.
- It's in the garage.

42:10.055 --> 42:12.387
May I see it?

42:34.113 --> 42:36.240
Pretty nice car for a cook.

42:37.583 --> 42:40.780
Some people have
a problem with the Germans.

42:40.886 --> 42:44.378
They are too aggressive, they
take up the best beaches in summer,

42:44.456 --> 42:46.822
they can't cook worth a damn.

42:49.928 --> 42:54.297
I say, anyone makes such great cars
can't be all bad.

42:54.400 --> 42:58.803
I would say you should work out
very well for Monsieur Frank.

42:59.405 --> 43:01.600
Work out for both of us.

43:08.280 --> 43:12.774
My intuition says this is probably
a good time for me to go file my report.

43:12.851 --> 43:17.686
- Where's the rest of my car?
- Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

43:17.790 --> 43:20.850
It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.

43:22.027 --> 43:24.325
What's left of it is down at the lab.

43:24.430 --> 43:31.165
They are trying to separate what was left of
the two cops in the trunk from the rest of it.

43:31.270 --> 43:34.205
But you wouldn't know anything about that?

43:34.306 --> 43:37.275
- No.
- Sorry to interrupt.

43:37.342 --> 43:41.472
- Thank you for the coffee and the memories.
- Come back anytime.

43:41.547 --> 43:45.313
- Would you mind walking me?
- No.

43:45.384 --> 43:52.051
You have always been very quiet
about your business. I appreciate that.

43:52.157 --> 43:56.321
This business at the rest stop,
it's not very quiet.

43:56.395 --> 44:00.627
Would you like to tell me something
besides the stolen-car story?

44:00.699 --> 44:02.291
If I had one, I would.

44:02.367 --> 44:06.963
May I suggest that when the two of you
show up in my office after lunch,

44:07.039 --> 44:11.635
that you have one -
a better one than you currently have.

44:18.517 --> 44:21.213
You are the one he wants to see, not me!

44:21.320 --> 44:26.849
- Quiet! Please. I have to think.
- You were supposed to think last night.

44:26.925 --> 44:29.655
Last night I had nightmares.

44:29.728 --> 44:33.596
About a girl who came into
my nice, quiet life, screwed it all up.

44:33.699 --> 44:38.102
Everything she touched broke
and every move became a catastrophe.

44:38.203 --> 44:40.501
OK, sorry.

44:42.207 --> 44:46.576
I'm still wondering if I want to know
everything or nothing about you.

44:55.120 --> 44:58.521
- What?
- It's the quiet.

44:58.590 --> 45:00.455
I thought you liked quiet.

45:04.062 --> 45:06.292
Not this quiet.

45:26.251 --> 45:27.149
You OK?

45:27.252 --> 45:29.413
- No.
- Good. Let's go.

45:39.264 --> 45:41.095
Go, go, go!

45:53.612 --> 45:54.943
No, don't stay there!

46:27.800 --> 46:29.461
Give me your hand!

46:53.292 --> 46:54.384
Come on!

46:56.562 --> 46:58.120
Come on, get in!

46:58.998 --> 47:00.124
Get in!

47:03.169 --> 47:07.367
Lai, look, hang on. Do you wanna die? Get in!

47:30.997 --> 47:34.865
Calm down, OK? Don't worry. You OK?

47:36.235 --> 47:39.693
- Stay here. I'll be right back.
- No. Wait! Wait!

47:53.185 --> 47:55.244
Put it on.

47:57.123 --> 48:02.026
You OK? Sure? OK, let's go.

49:41.393 --> 49:44.954
Frank? Is this your house?

49:49.835 --> 49:51.803
Yeah, I guess.

50:03.315 --> 50:06.512
I should mind my own goddamn business.

50:08.087 --> 50:11.079
Simple rule, simple little rule.

50:11.190 --> 50:15.559
There's gotta be some
dry clothes in this house.

50:16.262 --> 50:18.890
"Don't open the package."

50:18.998 --> 50:23.162
Nothin' but trouble,
you open the goddamn package.

50:23.235 --> 50:24.167
Frank?

50:29.008 --> 50:32.739
- What are you doing?
- Making up for the trouble.

50:37.917 --> 50:41.409
- Wait, wait. Why are you making...
- No more questions.

50:44.023 --> 50:47.015
Wait. I don't like it
when things get complicated.

50:47.092 --> 50:51.756
You like things simple. Very simple.

51:07.713 --> 51:14.209
I'm not so clear about the house. Could
you explain one more time? After I left...

51:14.286 --> 51:17.119
We walked on the beach, had a swim.

51:17.223 --> 51:18.918
- Where?
- Past the point.

51:18.991 --> 51:23.325
- Anyone else swimming?
- No. Did you see anybody else swimming?

51:23.429 --> 51:25.488
No, no one.

51:25.598 --> 51:28.465
So, you took a walk,

51:28.567 --> 51:32.264
had a swim on a beach
where no one else was swimming,

51:32.338 --> 51:37.401
past the point where you can't see or
be seen from the beach on either side,

51:37.476 --> 51:40.343
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

51:40.446 --> 51:44.849
That's the point of a romantic swim.
Who wants witnesses?

51:47.586 --> 51:50.919
- And then?
- We came back to the house, found it on fire.

51:50.990 --> 51:54.084
- Just like that? On fire?
- Yes.

51:55.094 --> 51:59.087
The 5,000 rounds of spent ammo
my men found all around the house?

51:59.164 --> 52:02.361
- Maybe they had the wrong house.
- Monsieur Frank,

52:02.468 --> 52:05.198
people with this kind of firepower

52:05.304 --> 52:09.206
do not make mistakes about who they visit.

52:09.308 --> 52:12.869
- Who would want you this dead?
- I don't know.

52:13.279 --> 52:17.215
- Any problems with a client?
- I don't have clients. I'm retired.

52:17.316 --> 52:19.944
I live on my army pension, you know that.

52:20.019 --> 52:22.715
You've had the facts
of who I am and who I was for years.

52:22.821 --> 52:25.790
Any enemies you can think of?
People from the past?

52:25.858 --> 52:28.793
I left the past behind when I moved here.

52:28.861 --> 52:32.456
A past like yours you never leave behind.

52:34.466 --> 52:39.403
- Commissaire?
- I'll just be a moment. Don't leave.

52:54.053 --> 52:56.647
- What are you doing?
- Computers know everything.

52:56.722 --> 52:58.883
- You just need a password.
- Are you nuts?

52:58.991 --> 53:02.256
- We're in a police station.
- You always complain,

53:02.361 --> 53:06.195
except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

53:31.290 --> 53:33.724
Hello. See?

53:52.544 --> 53:55.240
- So, where will you be staying?
- I don't know.

53:55.314 --> 53:58.147
Well, my cousin has a small hotel.

54:00.085 --> 54:04.317
- Thanks, but we'll manage.
- Without money? It will be hard.

54:04.423 --> 54:08.223
Here. It's not much,
but at least you won't go hungry.

54:08.293 --> 54:10.158
Thank you.

54:22.608 --> 54:24.769
- Where are you going?
- To see that guy.

54:24.843 --> 54:27.334
- Good luck.
- One moment.

54:27.446 --> 54:30.108
- You're not coming?
- No.

54:30.182 --> 54:33.151
- But he blew up your car.
- I'll buy a new one.

54:33.252 --> 54:35.846
- He burned your house.
- I'll rebuild it.

54:35.954 --> 54:39.117
- He tried to kill you.
- As far as he knows, he succeeded.

54:39.191 --> 54:44.151
Some advice... I don't know what you're into,
but whoever wanted you dead thinks you are.

54:44.263 --> 54:50.099
You have a free pass to start over.
Here's the advice: Start over!

54:55.174 --> 55:01.477
There are 400 people dying
in a container on a ship.

55:04.716 --> 55:06.980
My father.

55:07.052 --> 55:09.213
My sisters.

55:09.321 --> 55:11.983
The ship arrives today.

55:12.357 --> 55:15.292
They will make my father a slave.

55:16.495 --> 55:21.990
The only one who knows
the container number is that guy.

55:22.835 --> 55:26.032
- You're very good.
- What do you mean?

55:26.138 --> 55:30.632
From the moment you saw those pictures
in my house, you set me up to get involved.

55:30.709 --> 55:36.978
Breakfast, giving the excuse to the cop
to help me, one lie after another.

55:37.049 --> 55:41.179
- Not everything is a lie.
- Name one thing that isn't.

55:44.156 --> 55:48.354
What happened in the house between us,

55:48.427 --> 55:50.827
that was not a lie.

55:54.266 --> 55:58.396
You were a soldier.
Yourjob was to save people.

55:58.504 --> 56:01.337
- Past tense.
- What does that mean?

56:01.406 --> 56:04.398
I got tired of seeing
my best efforts turned into bullshit

56:04.510 --> 56:07.240
by the same people who pay me to do the job.

56:07.346 --> 56:12.181
- No one cared.
- This time, I care.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.759
Thank you.

56:40.412 --> 56:42.107
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

56:42.214 --> 56:44.808
No phone calls for half an hour?

56:45.250 --> 56:47.275
Hello. Surprise!

56:54.293 --> 56:56.386
Sit.

57:07.673 --> 57:10.506
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

57:10.609 --> 57:13.009
Before we get to the heart of the matter,

57:13.111 --> 57:15.636
I have a question: Why'd you try to kill me?

57:15.747 --> 57:18.739
You lied to me. You opened the package.

57:18.817 --> 57:21.081
You broke the rules, your rules.

57:21.153 --> 57:24.350
Did you expect me to
recommend you for anotherjob?

57:28.293 --> 57:30.625
What's the ship number?

57:32.598 --> 57:35.795
Mr Transporter, we can both agree.

57:35.867 --> 57:39.769
I answered your first question politely.
I won't answer any more.

57:39.838 --> 57:42.966
So I suggest you kill me right now.

57:44.343 --> 57:46.538
And go screw yourself.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.474
I can't find anything.

57:57.556 --> 58:00.184
Oh, poor Frank. What'd she tell you?

58:00.292 --> 58:02.852
We're smuggling people in containers?

58:02.961 --> 58:06.897
- Lai's the perfect name for her.
- Mr Kwai's on the way up.

58:06.999 --> 58:10.162
Your father's here. He'll get a kick out of this.

58:10.235 --> 58:14.069
- I thought your father was in a container.
- Yes. I mean, no.

58:14.172 --> 58:17.198
There are 400 people in that container.

58:17.309 --> 58:22.178
- Stay where you are!
- She's a real heartbreaker, isn't she?

58:24.850 --> 58:28.411
Ten seconds, two choices.
The information, or your brains on the desk.

58:28.520 --> 58:32.388
- Now tell me I'm lying! Nine... eight...
- Lai, give me the gun.

58:32.491 --> 58:35.255
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.852
Five... four... three... two...

58:39.398 --> 58:41.525
One. Shoot.

58:45.871 --> 58:47.168
Lai.

58:53.845 --> 58:58.680
- Liar?
- Would I kill my own daughter, Lai?

59:00.952 --> 59:04.786
Come on now. Put it down.

59:08.260 --> 59:10.888
We'll talk.

59:10.962 --> 59:15.023
She thinks we're smuggling
people in containers.

59:15.100 --> 59:18.126
- Where do you get these ideas?
- Stay away!

59:22.874 --> 59:28.540
- Could you kill your own father?
- Please, I am begging you.

59:28.613 --> 59:32.049
- Stop what you are doing.
- I do what I do.

59:32.117 --> 59:34.415
I am who I am. I'll never change.

59:34.486 --> 59:38.081
So if you're going to kill me, kill me.

59:38.457 --> 59:41.585
But if you don't, get this gun out of my face.

59:45.764 --> 59:48.460
- Give me.
- No!

59:48.567 --> 59:51.900
I know he's innocent.
Oh, you have such a good heart.

59:51.970 --> 59:57.101
Always interested in saving innocent people.
Well, here's your big chance.

59:57.175 --> 01:00:00.770
Drop your gun and you will save one.

01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:08.316
- Kill him!
- No!

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:12.848
- The police are coming.
- What now?

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:15.426
Take her.

01:00:16.328 --> 01:00:20.128
Send in Leo. I need him
to wrap something up.

01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:38.841
There were 400 people in that container.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.544
Only 395 made it here alive.

01:00:42.854 --> 01:00:44.617
Frank!

01:00:47.993 --> 01:00:52.362
- Inspector. Am I glad you're here.
- What is this?

01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:56.161
This man used my partner's daughter
to try and blackmail us.

01:00:56.234 --> 01:00:59.635
Luckily my security got the drop on him.

01:00:59.704 --> 01:01:03.231
I want to press charges:
Kidnapping, extortion, assault.

01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:06.242
- I know this man.
- I suppose in your business,

01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:08.869
you have to know all types.

01:01:10.816 --> 01:01:14.513
- Now should I call my lawyer?
- We'll handle it.

01:01:19.524 --> 01:01:22.925
I'll expect all of you
at my office for your statements.

01:01:23.028 --> 01:01:28.022
As soon as I contact my lawyer,
we'll be more than happy to oblige.

01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:48.748
The doctor said you'll have a headache,

01:01:48.854 --> 01:01:52.017
- then you'll go back to normal.
- Where are they?

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:57.084
I think you should be more
concerned with where you are.

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.090
What got into you?
You were always so careful.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.432
- I've got to get out of here.
- The charges are filed.

01:02:06.538 --> 01:02:10.372
You will not be getting out
for a very long time.

01:02:10.442 --> 01:02:14.378
Assaulting a distinguished member
of the business community,

01:02:14.446 --> 01:02:17.882
kidnapping his daughter, extortion...

01:02:17.949 --> 01:02:21.976
I'm sorry, Frank. I would like to help you.

01:02:22.087 --> 01:02:26.956
But if you continue with the same old
story: I'm retired, living on a pension...

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.055
I need fresh, Frank. I need new.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.291
For once, I need the truth.

01:02:37.636 --> 01:02:42.471
OK. They're smuggling people, from Asia,

01:02:42.574 --> 01:02:45.441
through Marseilles, in containers.

01:02:47.279 --> 01:02:50.146
- You know this for a fact?
- The girl told me.

01:02:50.815 --> 01:02:52.976
- You believe her?
- Yes.

01:02:53.084 --> 01:02:56.815
In French, we have a saying:
Never believe the cook.

01:02:58.256 --> 01:03:03.159
- She's not the cook.
- Oh. I suspected.

01:03:03.261 --> 01:03:06.697
- No one is perfect.
- You're saying you'll do nothing.

01:03:06.798 --> 01:03:10.700
I'm saying I'm going to start an investigation.

01:03:10.802 --> 01:03:13.703
400 people could be dead already.

01:03:13.805 --> 01:03:16.774
But what am I supposed to do?
There are laws.

01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:20.504
- Sometimes you make your own law.
- Like you do?

01:03:20.612 --> 01:03:22.842
It doesn't take me 12 months to do the job.

01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:26.884
Oh, yes, I know.
That's what I admire about you.

01:03:26.985 --> 01:03:30.887
All that army training,
all that sneaking around...

01:03:30.989 --> 01:03:34.652
A man like you could probably
resolve this case in how long?

01:03:34.726 --> 01:03:37.854
- 12 hours?
- Less.

01:03:37.963 --> 01:03:41.524
Less. Impressive.

01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:43.863
You'd be the perfect man for the job.

01:03:43.969 --> 01:03:49.635
- Yes. If I were out.
- Yes. If you were out.

01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:12.757
Anybody moves and I kill him.

01:04:48.867 --> 01:04:53.395
If this is how you transport,
I'm amazed you get any work at all.

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:55.564
Come on, give me a hand.

01:05:04.482 --> 01:05:08.782
- Maybe I should go with you?
- Thanks, but I'm better alone.

01:05:10.555 --> 01:05:13.319
That is a very small boat
to fight a very big war.

01:05:13.425 --> 01:05:17.122
Yeah. But it's a good boat.

01:05:17.228 --> 01:05:19.287
Frank, here.

01:05:20.265 --> 01:05:22.233
You'll need it.

01:05:25.003 --> 01:05:26.800
Or maybe not.

01:06:54.759 --> 01:06:57.387
Shipment is cleared. Here's the paperwork.

01:06:57.495 --> 01:07:00.328
Take the highway all the way
to the first exit, Lyon.

01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:04.698
Go straight to the warehouse.
We'll be right behind you, just in case.

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:23.053
OK, we are ready to go.

01:07:29.794 --> 01:07:31.785
Lai, dear...

01:07:39.404 --> 01:07:43.534
I spent thousands of dollars for you
to go to school and learn English.

01:07:43.608 --> 01:07:47.135
- The least you can do is speak it.
- I hate you.

01:07:50.882 --> 01:07:53.214
I'm still your father.

01:07:55.053 --> 01:07:57.544
Get her out of here!

01:08:16.241 --> 01:08:17.731
Give me a minute.

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:47.194
Keep him alive.

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.214
Let's go!

01:10:28.806 --> 01:10:30.865
No, don't!

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:33.368
Let's go!

01:17:00.664 --> 01:17:02.529
Bitch!

01:17:46.977 --> 01:17:50.538
Good morning. You lost?

01:17:50.648 --> 01:17:55.244
- I'm lookin' to do a little sightseeing.
- This plane is not for tourists.

01:17:56.887 --> 01:17:59.185
I'm not a tourist.

01:18:22.246 --> 01:18:24.544
Call this guy and tell him to meet me.

01:18:24.615 --> 01:18:26.708
Sure. Where?

01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:30.850
Down there.

01:18:58.716 --> 01:18:59.740
Here!

01:19:51.468 --> 01:19:53.333
Move up.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.291
Now.

01:22:09.339 --> 01:22:11.398
Get closer.

01:22:15.746 --> 01:22:17.270
- Steady.
- No, Dad, no!

01:22:21.819 --> 01:22:23.116
Get away!

01:23:49.039 --> 01:23:51.098
Down!

01:24:01.852 --> 01:24:05.083
Hands on your head. Move!

01:24:08.225 --> 01:24:12.525
Watch her. If she moves
or I don't return, shoot her.

01:24:15.465 --> 01:24:18.628
- To the water.
- I'm really not in the mood for a swim.

01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:20.936
March!

01:24:22.873 --> 01:24:26.138
So how did a lowlife like you
end up with my daughter?

01:24:26.243 --> 01:24:30.646
- Found her in a bag, where you left her.
- You know nothing. Move!

01:24:34.985 --> 01:24:37.818
You got involved with
the wrong girl, you dumbshit.

01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:41.379
The delivery will be made,
my daughter will get over it.

01:24:41.458 --> 01:24:44.723
If I'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light.

01:24:50.467 --> 01:24:53.095
If she's lucky, maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:56.833
- What do you know?
- She'll never stop being who she is.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.101
She'll never be you or anything like you.

01:24:59.176 --> 01:25:02.907
She'll come around.
But you won't be here to see it.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:04.004
No!

01:25:13.857 --> 01:25:17.418
I guess she won't be coming around after all.

01:25:20.197 --> 01:25:23.098
- Turn around!
- I'd rather see it coming.

01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:25.862
Makes no difference to me.

01:25:50.727 --> 01:25:55.164
He was a bastard, but he was still my father.

01:26:09.413 --> 01:26:12.007
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

01:26:15.352 --> 01:26:17.877
I guess I underestimated you.
