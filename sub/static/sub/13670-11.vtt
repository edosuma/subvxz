01:22.760 --> 01:26.760
# Come, they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

01:28.560 --> 01:32.560
# A newborn king to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

01:33.920 --> 01:37.920
# Our finest gifts we'll bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum... #

01:39.040 --> 01:40.560
        Where can I change?

01:40.560 --> 01:43.200
In the orderlies' lounge,
down the hall, turn left.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.200
Don't leave your wallet
lying around.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
I thought he comes down the chimney?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.680
               It's only once a year.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.000
I don't get it.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.800
                             Figures.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.360
I did your mother a favour
by bringing you here.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.720
Don't push your luck.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.680
Where's Santa Claus, grandma?

02:06.680 --> 02:10.639
I don't know, Max. Daniel, he
should have been here by now.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.160
He has a rather hectic schedule,
with the big event two days away.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.920
Dr Auschlander, I think dunderhead's
finally got the lights working.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.240
Want to do the honours?

02:19.240 --> 02:23.240
My dear.  Oh, thank you.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.520
Um, could I get your
attention for a moment, please?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.520
I want to thank the St Eligius
children's choir for being here

02:35.520 --> 02:39.520
today, and the women's auxiliary
for having arranged such beautiful

02:40.160 --> 02:41.800
   decorations again this year.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.480
Hooray!

02:43.480 --> 02:47.480
Merry Christmas to each
and every one of you.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.840
Christmas is the day
after tomorrow. &gt;

03:00.840 --> 03:03.240
You haven't even
brought the tree to the house. &gt;

03:03.240 --> 03:05.480
I've been very busy.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.840
I had two mitral valve
replacements today

03:07.840 --> 03:10.440
and a mortality conference
yesterday.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.520
And what with all the office party

03:12.520 --> 03:16.280
car wrecks, there's more chest
trauma than I can keep up with.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.040
The ornaments are in a box
on top of your grandmother's trunk.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.040
I know where they are.
I put them there.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.760
&lt; Hi.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.240
Get all your shopping done?

04:06.240 --> 04:08.680
Everyone except you,
the most difficult.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.720
Here you go, son.
When's Rick coming?

04:10.720 --> 04:11.880
                  Tomorrow afternoon.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.280
It's to snow. Hope he gets
here before it gets bad.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.800
     Thanks for inviting him.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.399
Can't have your boyfriend
being by himself.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.720
Does that mean he
can sleep in my room?

04:19.720 --> 04:20.760
Does that mean he
can sleep in my room?
No!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.160
Elizabeth!

04:22.160 --> 04:24.720
Hi, Mrs Auschlander. Awesome party.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.120
We finally got the lights
on the tree working,

04:27.120 --> 04:28.840
but still, no Santa.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.160
Oh, that big guy's not out here yet?

04:31.160 --> 04:33.200
And the children are
getting impatient.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.200
That bum you hired is still in
the orderlies' lounge. I'll get him.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.520
Santa, your public is waiting.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.680
Santa, your public is waiting.
          Be right there.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.280
 Luther, could you hand me my bag?

04:51.280 --> 04:53.360
How do you know my name?

04:53.360 --> 04:56.640
      We met a long time ago.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.440
    You were still half asleep.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.360
Oh, you were a patient here?

05:02.360 --> 05:05.760
Oh, I get it.
The old name tag trick.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.760
So, how's the
paramedic training going?

05:10.400 --> 05:14.400
You sent a front man ahead of the
you to get the skinny on everybody!

05:15.640 --> 05:18.320
That's very clever, Santa. &gt;

05:18.320 --> 05:20.440
You OK?

05:20.440 --> 05:22.320
 Just a little tired, that's all.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.160
This time of year,
who blames you?

05:24.160 --> 05:25.440
      Where are the children?

05:25.440 --> 05:29.440
You're Santa, you ought to know.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.440
# Tis the season to be jolly... #

05:35.440 --> 05:36.920
            Ho, ho, ho!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.920
Santa!

05:41.560 --> 05:42.800
         Merry Christmas!

05:42.800 --> 05:44.400
I got to get back to work.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.880
Thank you.
Merry Christmas, everybody.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.680
Sorry to be late,
but with all the holiday travel,

05:51.680 --> 05:55.680
     my sleigh got stacked up.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.200
                Ah.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.200
           Climb aboard.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.600
So, what's your name, young fellow?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.800
Max Auschlander.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.440
Max, that's a fine name, yes indeed.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.200
 Mrs Claus has a cousin named Max.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.440
Helps out with the
reindeer now and then.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
Oh, brother.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.760
      Say, why the long face?

06:23.760 --> 06:26.480
Cos he says there's no such
thing as Santa Claus.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.960
Really?
Well, that'll come as quite

06:28.960 --> 06:32.360
a surprise to Mrs Claus, and the
rest of the gang at the North Pole.

06:32.360 --> 06:36.360
So how much are they paying you
for this scam, you old fairy?

06:36.560 --> 06:40.560
              Oh...!

06:49.000 --> 06:51.840
CHILDREN ALL CLAMOUR

06:51.840 --> 06:55.080
(HUMS "DECK THE HALLS")

06:55.080 --> 06:58.360
Luther, my good man, a little
stocking stuffer for you.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.200
Here you go, Hawkins, Luther.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.360
Don't thank me, buddy. Just a
small token for a small token.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.520
Thanks!
You know what my present is to you?

07:05.520 --> 07:08.000
I'm not gonna drop-kick
you in the groin.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.040
Merry, merry.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.960
Wayne! Even though you and I
are of different persuasions,

07:14.960 --> 07:16.920
I want you to have this. Phil.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.040
A dollar?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.360
A crisp new 1986 dollar.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.640
Deeply personal.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.440
Signed by Katherine Davalos Ortega,
treasurer of the United States.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.000
Between the two of us, we could
have a big night at the laundry mat.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.640
I wonder what Boomer gave me.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.680
It's a label maker.
He gave me one too.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.880
Boomer got you guys presents?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.240
Boomer got you guys presents?
Yeah.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.000
He probably knew I already
had a label maker.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.120
Phil, thanks for the bottle of wine.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.720
And Wayne, the poinsettia
really livened up my apartment.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.240
Here you go.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.920
I always wanted a Bocce ball.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.120
No, they're paperweights. I made
them myself in pottery class.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.880
They say St Eligus on them
and have your name engraved.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.880
Elliot, Merry Christmas.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.600
Victor,
um...I don't know what to say.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.400
I didn't get you anything.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.920
Hey, no problem.
I'm not the paperweight type.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.680
Never would have used it anyway.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.680
Not interested in holding
anything down.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.320
You did it this time, Elliot.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.360
What?

08:17.360 --> 08:21.360
By not giving him a present,
you single-handedly spoiled
Victor's Christmas.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.920
It's not like I killed Santa Claus.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.320
When did you first notice the pain?

08:27.320 --> 08:31.240
Standing in line in Filene's
this afternoon. What a zoo.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.799
Yeah, everybody waits till
the last minute. Any vomiting?

08:34.799 --> 08:38.799
Once or twice. I figured
I'd backed into some bad eggnog.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.000
You're running a fever.
We may want to admit you.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.559
Well, no argument from me.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.720
With my luck, I'd get home,
keel over and be snowed in.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.880
Wouldn't find the body for days.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.880
CBCs, and set her up
for a pelvic exam.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.000
Get back. We've got
a male, late 60s,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.520
collapsed in the lobby
with chest pains.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.360
        Get a 12 lead EKG.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.080
We hit him with the paddles,
and he lit up like a Christmas tree.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.520
Lucky thing this didn't happen
at 15,000 feet

09:09.520 --> 09:12.840
with a sled full of Barbie dolls.
Did you start him on lidocaine?

09:12.840 --> 09:13.880
Still having PVCs.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.080
        Let's get this off.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.080
I tried. It's real.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.640
      Have an OR standing by.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.640
If we don't hold off his MI,
it's going to be his last Christmas.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.720
# Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

09:29.280 --> 09:33.280
# Jack Frost
nipping at your nose... #

09:33.360 --> 09:35.000
Time to open the big door.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.800
The radio says there's
a blizzard watch. A white Christmas.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.800
December 24th,
and here it is, ta-da!

09:43.200 --> 09:46.880
A nativity scene, wow!

09:46.880 --> 09:49.800
Since when do the archangels
look like that?

09:49.800 --> 09:52.560
Did you know you were
tossing and turning all night?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.320
I had a bad dream.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.720
I was in 19th century London,
running through the streets.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.720
It was snowing. All I had on
were pyjamas and a nightcap.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.160
You fell asleep watching
A Christmas Carol!

10:07.160 --> 10:10.280
We should invite more people
to the wassail party?

10:10.280 --> 10:11.920
   There are 20 coming as it is.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.320
Well, this year I want
a house full of people,

10:14.320 --> 10:18.320
I mean, packed to the rafters
with people having a good time.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.480
Besides, Barbara's first Noel
has got to be the best.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.080
KNOCK ON DOOR

10:24.080 --> 10:27.560
I'll invite some of the young
people from hospital.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.560
Season's greetings.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.520
What happened to "Merry Christmas"?

10:31.520 --> 10:35.520
Maybe you don't celebrate
the religious nature of the holiday.
How do I know?

10:35.600 --> 10:39.600
Yesterday you delivered a balsam
wreath from Maine, cedar garlands
from Vermont the day before.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.400
We are not decking
the halls for Ramadan.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.840
Don't you have junk mail
to deliver?

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
Customary for folks to give their
mailman some kind of bonus
this time of year.

10:54.280 --> 10:58.080
Yes, and the amount is reflected by
the quality of the service rendered.

10:58.080 --> 11:02.080
You get the Christmas goose egg.
Now, get out of here.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.360
Mark!

11:08.360 --> 11:11.360
   Merry Christmas, Mr Lesniak!

11:11.360 --> 11:14.040
Fruitcake. Thank you, Mrs Craig.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.040
A merry one to you and...the baby.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.120
             Bye-bye.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.000
Mark, that was a terrible thing
to say.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
When you're a civil servant, Kris
Kringle comes every day of the year.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.640
That man has job security, benefits,

11:31.640 --> 11:35.640
minimal responsibility
and the intellect of a prune Danish.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.040
Cape Cod candles! The Bayberry
tape has finally arrived!

11:40.440 --> 11:42.960
       In the nick of time.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.440
Bayberry candles,
burnt to the socket,

11:45.440 --> 11:49.000
brings health to your family
and wealth to your pocket.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.840
       "Blayberries", Mark.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.240
    Do you remember how Stephen

11:52.240 --> 11:56.240
could hardly wait to
light the "Blayberries"?

11:56.640 --> 12:00.640
Listen, call the caterer and have
him double the order for tonight.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.240
Then watch him triple the price.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.800
I'll be home early.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.800
# Although it's been said many times
Many ways...

12:12.200 --> 12:16.200
    # Merry Christmas to you. #

12:21.440 --> 12:24.560
The children all came back.
They're holding a vigil.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.680
I know, dear.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.520
Oh, Dr Auschlander, we got
a lobby full of unhappy kids.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.560
I've heard.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.120
OK.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.240
         I feel terrible.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.840
       I hired the poor man.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.840
You're not responsible.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.280
Is Santa gonna be
all right, Grandpa?

12:45.280 --> 12:48.160
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Boys and girls, there's no reason

12:48.160 --> 12:50.680
for you to wait here.
Santa's going into surgery,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.640
and he won't be able
to have visitors.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.520
Surgery in this dump?
Guy doesn't have a prayer.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.360
What if he can't slide down
the chimney tonight?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
Santa has a lot of elves to help him.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.320
It's not the same!

13:02.320 --> 13:05.280
I can't remember ever seeing
so many unhappy children.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.800
Poor kids, having a Santa Claus
fall over right in front of them.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.680
I wish there was something
we could do to cheer them up.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.720
I've got an idea. We'll have
a sing-along, like with Mitch.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.720
Boys and girls, I'm sure Santa's
spirits will be perked

13:19.680 --> 13:21.840
if we all sing together.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.560
# Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

13:25.560 --> 13:29.560
# Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh, hey... #

13:30.000 --> 13:32.160
You think Santa's gonna die?

13:32.160 --> 13:35.200
You'd better hope not,
cos if he does, it's all your fault.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.640
You're the one who said there's
no such thing as Santa Claus.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, but at least I was smart
enough to humour the guy.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.560
You blabbed it right to his face.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.000
You can't kill people
just by saying stuff.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.600
You heard what the
gawky-looking doctor said.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.600
A heart attack, cos you broke it.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.440
'Nurse Shannon Elliot,
to the third floor nursing station.'

13:56.440 --> 13:59.920
Get up on the wrong side
of the bed this morning?

13:59.920 --> 14:03.680
I'm trying not to take
it personally, but not
a single present.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.600
Mr Underhill's sigmoidoscopy.
Sorry it's not wrapped.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.920
You've been doling out
poinsettias.. Do I get one? No!

14:09.920 --> 14:12.600
Remember last time
you took care of my plant?

14:12.600 --> 14:13.880
That was a long time ago.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.240
I don't want to inflict that kind of
torture on an innocent house plant.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.720
But I've been giving
everyone presents.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.560
You'd think somebody
would return the favour.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.760
You've been giving presents
to get something in return?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.080
Karma, pal.
What goes around comes around.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.800
You reap what you sow,
tit-for-tat and vice versa.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.280
Victor, you are the most insensitive
glad-hander I have ever met.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.200
But somewhere deep down
in that caraway seed of a heart,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.680
there's a millimicron
of generosity, maybe.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.320
Well, I want my dollar back.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.320
You don't get any presents cos you
don't have any friends, and that's
cos you're only out for yourself.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.640
I love it when you talk rough to me.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.280
CAROLS PLAY

14:51.280 --> 14:54.400
      I'm removing the vein.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.400
Dr Wade, I need you up here
to assist. Sternal retractor.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.040
If anyone's cooking a goose
tomorrow,

15:02.040 --> 15:06.040
these come in handy to get out
the stuffing.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.120
    Those voices are beautiful.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.360
The sisters of the Abbey
of St Vitus.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.360
Mrs Craig and I visited there
on a trip to the Holy Land.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.360
They sell the cassettes
right next to the grotto.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.600
I'm looking forward to your
wassail party tonight, Dr Craig.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.480
Well, make sure you have snow tyres.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.280
I don't want anybody
getting stranded at my house.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.440
Party? What party?

15:32.440 --> 15:35.680
Oh. Well, I didn't invite you,

15:35.680 --> 15:38.880
because I'm sure you don't
celebrate Yuletide.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.800
It's nothing personal.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.400
I understand. They never let poor
Rudolph join in any reindeer games.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.520
Oh, stop!

15:46.520 --> 15:49.200
Vijay, do they have anything
like Christmas in India?

15:49.200 --> 15:52.600
As a child, I awaited the Festival
of Holi with great excitement.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.880
My grandfather and I would
 rise before dawn

15:54.880 --> 15:57.200
and splash bright paint
   all over an elephant,

15:57.200 --> 16:01.200
and we'd ride into the village
and throw coloured powder on
everyone that we met.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.360
Worst thing that ever happened
to India was the end of British
colonialism.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.080
Check the oxygen,
he's still having PVCs.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.200
And as long as you don't bring
a date, you can come tonight.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.240
It's a deal.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.080
Dr Wade, would you review
the indication of the surgery?

16:17.080 --> 16:20.920
Mrs Hayburn, I'm Dr Ehrlich...
What are you doing?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.200
Packing.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.760
No, you came in last night

16:23.760 --> 16:26.960
with vomiting, fever,
right lower quadrant pain.

16:26.960 --> 16:27.920
I feel better.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.400
I feel better.
Your white count's 11,800.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.600
I have to keep you here
for observation.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.960
Over my dead body.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.960
Mrs Hayburn, you might
have a ruptured follicle cyst

16:38.520 --> 16:41.080
or something more
serious like appendicitis.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.360
We won't know until
we perform some tests.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.360
I have a plane to catch.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.080
You're in no condition
to fly the friendly skies.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.080
Look, my whole family
is in Washington DC.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.040
I am not spending the holiday

16:54.040 --> 16:57.480
cooped up in some
slum hospital all by myself.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.680
If you have family,
you know what I mean.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.440
Actually, I don't.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.200
What I have is an alcoholic
aunt living in Napa Valley,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.520
a brother and sister
I haven't laid eyes on

17:06.520 --> 17:09.160
since my parents died
tragically when I was a boy.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.319
So you see, we're both kindred
spirits.

17:11.319 --> 17:15.319
We're both completely,
hopelessly, pathetically alone.

17:15.720 --> 17:19.319
You don't have to spend Christmas
alone, I'm gonna be by your side.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.800
This is a private room.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.160
I'm gonna prove to those nay-sayers

17:24.160 --> 17:27.079
that Victor Ehrlich
is a very human being.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.720
This is extremely generous...

17:28.720 --> 17:31.040
No, it's not. That's my problem.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.360
Please allow me to perform
this selfless act

17:33.360 --> 17:35.640
and I promise, I'll
never bother you again.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.480
But Dr...

17:36.480 --> 17:37.520
But Dr...
Call me Victor.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.520
What kind of Jello do you like?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.040
Daniel, are you sure this
is the right thing to do?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.920
Santa suggested this himself.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.920
He didn't want the
children to worry.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.560
              Quiet.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.760
This is where people come to get
better after heart surgery.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.760
My grandmother croaked
around here.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.800
Is he dead?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.440
He's just resting.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.400
See that monitor over his bed?
That shows his heartbeat.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.440
Now, altogether, children.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.440
Merry Christmas, Santa!

18:15.600 --> 18:17.320
 Hi, thought you were in surgery?

18:17.320 --> 18:20.320
Routine triple bypass, in and out.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.480
Now, you're coming to
my wassail party tonight, right?

18:23.480 --> 18:27.480
Afterwards, maybe you and the kids
can join us at St Barnabas's
midnight service.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.280
The church is ablaze
with candles, very moving.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.600
I don't think
we'll make either, Mark.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.320
Some traditions never change.
Every year I invite you,

18:35.320 --> 18:38.440
and every year you're a no-show.
Should I take this personally?

18:38.440 --> 18:41.040
The holidays are something
I endure, not enjoy.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.360
For a level-headed guy,
Donald, you're totally off-kilter.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.040
Does this look like
pneumothorax to you?

18:47.040 --> 18:49.960
No, you've got markings
all the way up the peripheries.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.560
I didn't think so.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.560
Your problem is, you get bogged
down in the Madison Avenue
side of the season.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.680
I mean, what is Christmas?

18:57.680 --> 19:00.640
Christ's birthday, dammit.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.560
My son doesn't even
know who Jesus is.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.280
Who the hell's fault is that?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.120
            Look, Mark,

19:07.120 --> 19:09.520
  when I was a child growing up,

19:09.520 --> 19:12.280
my dad used to take me from
the squalor of our tenement

19:12.280 --> 19:14.080
to the squalor of my aunt's tenement.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.080
30 people crammed into
the same, smoky little room.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.680
Collars too starchy,
new shoes pinching,

19:21.680 --> 19:23.840
 everyone straining to be polite.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.440
   Jeez, tension was unbearable.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.000
People waiting for my cousin
Alice to drop a glass

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
or my uncle Patrick to get loaded
and throw a punch at somebody.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.760
People too poor to buy gifts,
and too proud to admit it.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.840
Boy, Donald, you really
have a knack.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.840
You turn the biggest clambake
in Christendom into a dirge.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.520
Christmas is a fantasy, Mark.
It's a recollection of happier,

19:47.520 --> 19:50.440
simpler times that were never
there in the first place.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.440
It's something you can't recreate,
no matter how much holly you hang.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.680
Do me a favour.
Don't come to my party.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.680
Another miserable Christmas
at St Eligius, huh, Boomer?

20:06.680 --> 20:07.720
You got it.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.280
Let nothing you dismay, for I bring
you tidings of comfort and joy.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.280
Having a little soiree tonight
for one of the shut-ins, room 3311.
You guys should come.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.320
       Sounds like a blast.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.560
Dr Craig, Felice Navidad.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.160
Hello, Victor.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.200
Hello, Victor.
Hi, Pops.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.680
       How's Aunt Charisse?

20:32.680 --> 20:36.200
Ehrlich, party tonight,
my house. Be there.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.080
Sorry, sir, but I'm on call.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.000
That's too bad. ..Rest comfortably.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
        My best to Barbara.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.680
Mrs Craig was looking
forward to seeing you.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.720
She was?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.880
Well, you add a certain texture
to a party, liven things up.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.280
Yeah, like the time
I ralphed in your garden.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.640
You should have seen
the gladiolas that year,

21:01.640 --> 21:03.040
the size of cauliflower.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.120
You should come over this spring
and try the rose bushes.

21:06.120 --> 21:10.120
You're just being polite.
Don't forget, everyone got
the drizzles at my wedding.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.920
Well, you were trying to patch
things up between me and my brother.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.720
Lame, but at least your heart
was in the right spot.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.520
You really want me to come?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.640
You really want me to come?
Want me to engrave it
on your forehead?!

21:19.640 --> 21:21.240
Do you have any idea
what this means to me?

21:21.240 --> 21:22.400
Do you have any idea
what this means to me?
A free meal?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.240
A personal invitation to a party,

21:24.240 --> 21:27.320
to bask in the warmth of your hearth
at this festive time,

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
I'm thrilled, I'm honoured, I'm...

21:29.320 --> 21:33.320
In my way.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.200
               Max.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.200
Hi.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.320
Sorry our conversation
got cut short yesterday.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.280
That's OK. How are you feeling?

21:55.280 --> 21:59.240
 Like Cupid and Comet and Blitzen

21:59.240 --> 22:02.160
have all been dancing on my chest.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.880
You know that stuff
that I was saying about

22:04.880 --> 22:07.480
how there's no such thing
as Santa Claus?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.880
I didn't mean it.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.560
        Listen to me, Max.

22:12.560 --> 22:16.120
 It's important to ask questions,

22:16.120 --> 22:20.080
not to accept everything
at face value.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.320
            Understand?

22:21.320 --> 22:24.640
No.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.640
What's this present you
wanted to talk to me about?

22:29.120 --> 22:31.400
It's not for me. For my grandma.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.400
One weekend, I was staying with her,
tossing a ball around the house.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.080
I broke a glass snowball that
was a gift from her grandmother,

22:41.160 --> 22:42.960
from England, somewhere.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.320
She hugged me
and said accidents happen,

22:45.320 --> 22:47.000
but I could tell she was sad.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
And you would like me
to replace the snowball?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.200
         Consider it done.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.200
 Now, how about something for you?

22:59.560 --> 23:03.000
I just want you to get better...

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
..But an Annihilator 5000
would be nice.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.480
MACHINE FLATLINES

23:08.480 --> 23:12.480
Santa? Wake up, Santa!

23:14.720 --> 23:18.720
Somebody help!

23:21.240 --> 23:25.240
We got a full arrest.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.240
      "To Lizzie, love Dad".

23:32.240 --> 23:33.560
I'll get the dishes, Dr.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.560
       What did you get me?

23:35.560 --> 23:37.280
That's supposed to be a surprise.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.200
                I bet it's a sweater!

23:39.200 --> 23:41.160
Why don't you let the dog in?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.240
He's OK outside.

23:42.240 --> 23:42.920
It's too cold.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.400
It's too cold.
           What about your allergies?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.360
They won't bother
me as much as that.

23:46.360 --> 23:50.360
DOG WHINES

23:50.480 --> 23:53.120
     Oh, it's started snowing.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.880
   I'll put him in the basement.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.720
What do you want to do tonight,
Rick? Go to the movies?

23:58.720 --> 23:59.360
On Christmas Eve?

23:59.360 --> 24:00.960
On Christmas Eve?
Wouldn't have to wait in line.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.400
Let's do something more Christmassy.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.600
No, you guys do whatever
you usually do on. Movie's fine.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.080
Is Rambo playing?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.360
Why don't we stay at home
and open presents?

24:10.360 --> 24:11.920
OK. I'll get Tommy.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.640
You open your presents the night
before the big day?

24:14.640 --> 24:16.640
Is that a German
custom or something?

24:16.640 --> 24:20.040
I don't know. We open presents
whenever we get around to it.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.760
You're bummed out that we're so
low-key about the holidays, huh?

24:23.760 --> 24:26.440
No, I'm having a good time, really.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.120
You're used to a more
traditional Christmas.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.360
Yeah. My family does the full
Charles Dickens thing, you know.

24:32.360 --> 24:36.360
Plum pudding, eggnog, lasagne.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.440
Only this year in Sarasota.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.480
Weird, huh?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.920
OK, let's get started. Who's first?

24:42.920 --> 24:46.920
   No, Tommy, that's not yours.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.320
Good wassail requires a delicate
balance of ingredients.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.880
That ought to do it.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.040
Here, Mark.

25:01.040 --> 25:04.120
Oh, boy. This is duller
than your cousin Harold.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.720
Mr Kepler was supposed to
sharpen 'em yesterday,

25:06.720 --> 25:08.720
but he's out
of town for the holidays.

25:08.720 --> 25:12.720
Just like a tinker. When you need
one of them, he doesn't give a damn.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.800
      It's freezing in here.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.480
Well, the evergreens have
to stay on the cool side.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.480
    52 degrees? Are you crazy?!

25:19.480 --> 25:22.040
Honey, the tree has to last
until Twelfth Night.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.800
I don't want it dropping needles.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.800
You'll give Barbara pneumonia.

25:28.880 --> 25:29.960
Eggnog's all right.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.960
Ham, Swedish meatballs,
mincemeat tarts, the light,

25:34.200 --> 25:36.280
 the trees, everything is perfect!

25:36.280 --> 25:38.040
This needs a little something.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.560
    How about me? Do I look OK?

25:40.560 --> 25:42.000
Not bad.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.680
Tone down the rouge
and lipstick, though.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.560
Starting to look like Raggedy Ann.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.560
                       Sorry I asked.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.560
Come on!

25:55.560 --> 25:59.440
Elliot, this isn't working.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.920
Let's call it.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.920
Are you kidding? And be remembered
as the guy who killed Santa Claus?

26:06.160 --> 26:10.160
Clear.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.920
I can see it in
            the history books now. &gt;

26:12.920 --> 26:14.640
John Wilkes Booth.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.080
Sirhan Sirhan. Elliot Axelrod.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.280
Not this Jew.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.280
Clear.

26:22.280 --> 26:26.160
       Elliot...he's gone...

26:26.160 --> 26:30.160
..and you should be, too.
Your shift is over.

26:42.720 --> 26:46.720
Why me? Why is it always me?

26:54.080 --> 26:58.080
You let Santa Claus die!

26:58.680 --> 27:01.200
Max, where are you
              going in such a hurry?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.400
What was all that about?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.600
Santa Claus is mort and
my name is mud.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.680
It's not like he was
really Santa Claus.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.280
He was stable when we brought
him up from surgery,

27:11.280 --> 27:14.680
but he developed EKG changes,
which indicated a massive MRI.

27:14.680 --> 27:18.680
Excuse me, I have
to find my grandson.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.080
Aha! I'll be right here
after the ultrasound.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.640
Can't wait(!)

27:26.640 --> 27:27.680
Go in with that.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.680
(WHISTLES:
  We Wish You A Merry Christmas)

27:37.520 --> 27:39.480
This is my favourite Christmas show.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.680
It's A Wonderful Life?

27:40.680 --> 27:42.800
It's called The Yule Log.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.680
About firewood?

27:44.680 --> 27:46.160
No, it's a film loop.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.560
Maybe I'll try the tree
             over by the window.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.280
Mrs Hayburn's on clear liquid,
  so have the dietician prepare

27:53.280 --> 27:57.120
some mulled cider and a festive
arrangement of red and green Jello.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.120
I'm not working dinner tonight -
Dr Craig's party.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.600
Luther, you disappoint me.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.680
I'm offering you the opportunity
 to bring a ray of sunshine

28:04.680 --> 28:07.800
into the gloomy Christmas of
  an infirm fellow human being,

28:07.800 --> 28:10.720
but you'd rather go off to a
high-class party with great food,

28:10.720 --> 28:13.080
bons mots,
 and if you pick your spot right,

28:13.080 --> 28:15.240
a chance to move up
      the St Eligius ladder.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.720
Sounds good to me.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.720
Me too. Bring me back a doggy bag.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.920
"A present for you,
who I love like no other.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.920
"The merriest Christmas to
the best of all brothers".

28:29.600 --> 28:31.480
Tommy bird!

28:31.480 --> 28:34.280
                     Merry Christmas.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.840
                     Your turn, Rick.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.840
Um, Lizzie told me about this
little  tradition you have

28:40.280 --> 28:42.200
of reading poems, so here goes.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.200
I'm sort of a novice at this.

28:44.200 --> 28:48.200
I'm sort of a novice at this.
                       It's OK, Rick.

28:48.440 --> 28:52.440
"I got this at Lizzie's behest,
whilst we were travelling out west.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.680
"As I noticed before,
     you like strange decor,

28:55.680 --> 28:59.040
"so here's a doodad
     for next to your door."

28:59.040 --> 29:03.040
             I hope you like it, Dad.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.960
Wow!

29:08.960 --> 29:10.560
It's to go with your spoon.

29:10.560 --> 29:14.320
Don't know how I ever got along
without one. Thank you, kids.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.960
Very thoughtful of you.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.560
What time are we going to church?

29:18.560 --> 29:19.760
What time are we going to church?
                            Church? &gt;

29:19.760 --> 29:23.640
Yeah, you know, here's the steeple,
open the door, see all the people.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.240
We don't usually go to church, Rick.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.680
We don't usually go to church, Rick.
                               Never.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.560
Not even on Christmas?

29:28.560 --> 29:31.120
What, do you guys
give out candy on Halloween?

29:31.120 --> 29:34.680
If Rick wants to go to church, why
don't you take him to St Barnabas?

29:34.680 --> 29:37.120
Mark Craig said they have
  a beautiful midnight service.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.840
Mark Craig said they have
  a beautiful midnight service.
     OK, if you don't mind Episcopal.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.400
Episcopal's fine. All the pageantry,
none of the guilt.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.040
Episcopal's fine. All the pageantry,
none of the guilt.
                 You'll come with us?

29:44.040 --> 29:45.880
No, I'll stay
     and take care of Tommy.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.160
Tommy go Lizzie!

29:47.160 --> 29:48.360
              Come on, Dad, for once?

29:48.360 --> 29:49.400
I'd rather not.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.920
                     OK, be stubborn.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.360
          Thanks for the new sweater.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.400
You're welcome.

29:54.400 --> 29:58.400
                    Come on, Tommy. &gt;

29:59.160 --> 30:01.240
Kochar, get yourself a drink.

30:01.240 --> 30:05.240
Yes.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.360
Codeine, number three, POQ six hours,
PRN pain.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.600
That should hold him
till my hangover wears off.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.400
Those better be local calls.

30:14.400 --> 30:18.400
DOOR BELL RINGS

30:20.360 --> 30:23.200
Sorry I'm late, but it's
really coming down out there.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.200
Axelrod, Axelrod, Axelrod.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.240
Good to see you.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.720
Good to see you.
It is?

30:28.720 --> 30:29.160
                     Merry Christmas!

30:29.160 --> 30:30.920
                     Merry Christmas!
Of course, you know my wife.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.360
We haven't had the pleasure.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.680
We haven't had the pleasure.
Ellen, this is Axelrod.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.200
Elliot Axelrod.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.040
Elliot Axelrod.
            I'm so happy to know you.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.800
Help the big guy out of his tarp.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.440
I've got a toast to make.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.520
Quite a spread.
Looks like everybody's here.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.520
Everybody's not here,
but I'm going to start anyway.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.760
So, this is the wassail
I heard so much about.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.240
Luther, quit hovering.
Make yourself useful.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

31:00.040 --> 31:04.040
Every year at this time, we take
a few moments to renew the bonds

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
of fellowship and goodwill which
might otherwise fall into disrepair.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.480
Therefore, if you will please
  raise your glasses with me

31:13.480 --> 31:16.080
in a traditional wassail toast.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.240
Mark, I think our guests
should be warned

31:18.240 --> 31:20.360
that the toast is in Middle English.

31:20.360 --> 31:24.040
It will be obvious to anyone
who's had a freshman course.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.040
And not so obvious
to those that haven't.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.240
All right.

31:32.240 --> 31:36.240
New is jol kommen
With a gentle cheera

31:37.480 --> 31:41.440
Of mirth and gormen,
                he hath no peerer

31:41.440 --> 31:44.400
In every land where he comes nearer

31:44.400 --> 31:47.640
Is mirth and gormen ya dar well say.

31:47.640 --> 31:48.480
              Cheers.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.480
              Cheers.
New is kommen a messengera
Of your Lord, sir new yeara

31:55.400 --> 31:59.400
Biddest us all mak merry here
And maken merry as we may

32:01.040 --> 32:02.560
              Cheers.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.560
              Cheers.
Therefore, every man that is here

32:07.120 --> 32:10.960
Sing a carol in his maneer

32:10.960 --> 32:14.960
                Oh.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.120
What the hell did you do that for?

32:17.120 --> 32:19.160
I thought it was part of the custom.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.520
Clean this up, will you?
     Give me another glass.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.760
I've got to start over.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.760
New is jol komen
With gentle cheera...

32:29.280 --> 32:31.920
Never thought
I'd live to see the day.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.920
Mark Craig bombed.

32:56.480 --> 33:00.480
There's never going to be
another Christmas, ever again.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.440
Oh, no.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.200
That isn't so.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.720
How can it be without Santa?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.560
Well, Max,

33:09.560 --> 33:11.600
Santa isn't gone.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.400
I watched him die.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.480
I heard the buzzer go off
and his heart stopped beating.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.480
Max, Santa's more than just one man.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.320
He's the generosity in each of us.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.480
Look, you could have been
at home playing, but instead

33:27.480 --> 33:30.640
you came here because of
your concern for a sick friend.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.640
It's that giving and sharing in you
that's the spirit of Christmas.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.440
You mean I'm Santa?

33:37.440 --> 33:38.960
Sort of.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.960
He's in our hearts and our thoughts.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.960
And as long as we believe in him,
he'll always be with us.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.760
Still, that man shouldn't have died.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.960
Not on Christmas Eve.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.960
Max, people die,
even on Christmas Eve.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.880
But life goes on.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.400
So let's find your grandmother and
go home, wait for your parents

34:07.400 --> 34:11.400
and hang up our stockings
           with great care.

34:13.560 --> 34:17.560
PHONE RINGS

34:18.880 --> 34:21.040
Hello.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.920
Oh, hi, Constance.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.639
Thank you, same to you.

34:25.639 --> 34:28.480
Yeah, they're right here.
I'll talk to you later.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.800
Aunt Constance.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.800
Hi, Aunt Constance.
Got any snow there?

34:34.560 --> 34:37.199
&lt; That's great.
We've got three inches so far.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.760
&lt; Yeah, it's snowing here too...

34:39.760 --> 34:41.159
You OK?

34:41.159 --> 34:43.800
Oh, yeah, Dr Westphall, sure.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.800
I'm fine.

34:48.239 --> 34:52.239
Rick, I'm sorry you're not
having a very good time.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.199
It's not your fault, Dr Westphall.

34:56.199 --> 35:00.200
It's just that Christmas
used to be my favourite holiday.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.640
It used to be the presents,
         but now I like

35:03.640 --> 35:07.640
sitting around the fire,
  everybody together, nothing to do,

35:08.960 --> 35:12.960
just listening to my dad tell
   the same stupid jokes every year.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.360
Never thought I'd miss him so much.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.360
Yeah, while we're young, we tend
to take our family for granted.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.080
We figure they'll always be there.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.360
Then we get a little older,
and we realise

35:24.360 --> 35:26.680
how fragile families really are.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.680
You know, my folks, my sisters
are spread all over the country.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.440
The only time we're
together is Christmas.

35:33.440 --> 35:37.440
For a couple of days,
anyway, we're a family again.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.920
That's what Christmas
celebrates, right?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.640
Yeah.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.640
So why did my folks go
to Florida this year?

35:45.800 --> 35:49.320
Maybe they didn't realise how
much being home means to you.

35:49.320 --> 35:52.520
Yeah. Failure to communicate.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.720
&lt; Rick, time for church!

35:53.720 --> 35:54.760
&lt; Rick, time for church!
Coming.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.800
Here, try some of that.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.800
We always used to have eggnog during
Christmas...oh, but not like this!

36:06.240 --> 36:10.240
Dr Westphall,
do Lizzie and Tommy a favour, OK?

36:10.280 --> 36:12.880
Don't ever go to
Florida for Christmas.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.080
OK, I promise!

36:14.080 --> 36:18.080
Good night.

36:20.440 --> 36:24.440
#  It's Christmas time in the city

36:25.320 --> 36:29.320
# Hear them ring, ding a ling. #

36:29.360 --> 36:32.040
Don we now our gay apparel,
   Mrs Hayburn.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.960
Mrs Hayburn?

36:33.960 --> 36:37.960
"Left for DC.
Thanks anyway, Merry Christmas".

36:38.080 --> 36:41.160
I have no one but myself to blame.
I deserve to be stood up.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.240
You've learned a very valuable
lesson here today, Victor.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.360
Yeah, on holidays, trick
another resident into taking call.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.760
Well, at least you can
              spend Christmas Eve

36:49.760 --> 36:51.280
with people you're close to.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.600
That's true.
You're right about that.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.760
Hey, fellas, to friendship.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.320
I care for you guys
a lot, you know that?

37:00.320 --> 37:02.800
Whoa, whoa, Craig's party.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.800
Help yourself to the Jello.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.080
    # Ding a ling,  ding a ling

37:11.080 --> 37:14.400
# It's Christmas time in the city...

37:14.400 --> 37:16.800
You sound pretty good.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.120
Well, if I bake
the Christmas pies tonight,

37:19.120 --> 37:22.760
there'll be time for one...no, two
batches of cookies in the morning.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.920
Then I'll need
the oven for the turkey.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.480
Without your grandmother's
logistical mind,

37:27.480 --> 37:29.320
I don't know how we'd make it.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.600
Can I help decorate the cookies?

37:30.600 --> 37:31.760
Can I help decorate the cookies?
                           Of course!

37:31.760 --> 37:34.280
I found this present under the tree.
It has your name on it.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.840
I found this present under the tree.
It has your name on it.
              For me?

37:36.840 --> 37:38.120
        Daniel, you shouldn't have! &gt;

37:38.120 --> 37:39.160
        Daniel, you shouldn't have! &gt;
I didn't.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.600
"For Catherine".
It's not your handwriting.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.760
          "Love, Santa".

37:43.760 --> 37:45.960
Aren't you gonna open it?

37:45.960 --> 37:47.600
    Let's wait until tomorrow.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.920
It might be perishable.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.920
       Well...let's see. Oh!

37:55.240 --> 37:57.840
         Oh, my snowball!

37:57.840 --> 38:00.080
Just like the one
Grandmother gave me. &gt;

38:00.080 --> 38:01.560
 Daniel, where did you find it? &gt;

38:01.560 --> 38:02.720
 Daniel, where did you find it? &gt;
Well, I...

38:02.720 --> 38:05.440
It's from Santa! He promised me.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.880
       Look how it sparkles!

38:08.880 --> 38:12.880
SLEIGH BELLS RING

38:23.080 --> 38:26.760
"From the top of the porch
    to the top of the wall,

38:26.760 --> 38:30.760
"now dash away, dash away,
    dash away, all."

38:33.200 --> 38:36.760
Dr Auschlander, the lovely Mrs
Auschlander, little Auschlander,

38:36.760 --> 38:39.160
are you on your way to
Dr Craig's shindig?

38:39.160 --> 38:39.720
I'm afraid not. &gt;

38:39.720 --> 38:40.760
I'm afraid not. &gt;
Oh.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.080
Is it inconvenient for
you to drop me there?

38:42.080 --> 38:43.520
Is it inconvenient for
you to drop me there?
Actually, yes.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.480
                              Daniel!

38:45.480 --> 38:47.960
Well, er...here. Here.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.240
Here's a ten spot. Take a cab.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.840
Here's a ten spot. Take a cab.
Thanks!

38:51.840 --> 38:52.920
Merry Christmas!

38:52.920 --> 38:56.920
Merry Christmas to you.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.440
Take the bus.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.560
Excuse me.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.920
           Here she is!

39:12.920 --> 39:16.480
This is for you, Barbara.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.480
Didn't want you to
sleep through it all.

39:22.040 --> 39:26.040
Listen, before we go to church,
     I'd like to thank all of you

39:26.280 --> 39:30.280
for sharing our granddaughter's
     first Christmas.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.560
And speaking of the first
   Christmas, let's not forget

39:36.560 --> 39:40.560
that we are celebrating
the birth of Christ, God's only son.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.400
You know, er...

39:49.400 --> 39:53.400
This tree is an archive
             of my family's history.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.680
This ornament,

39:57.680 --> 40:00.800
forged in Philadelphia
              by Samuel Craig

40:00.800 --> 40:04.800
at the time of
           the Continental Congress.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.400
And this,

40:08.400 --> 40:12.080
I made that in second grade.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.080
And every Christmas Eve
for the last 120 years,

40:18.800 --> 40:22.600
this star has been put on top

40:22.600 --> 40:26.440
of a Craig tree.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.760
Handed down

40:28.760 --> 40:32.720
from one generation to the next.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.720
Now it will skip a generation.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.120
Excuse me.

40:45.120 --> 40:49.120
             Jacqui...

40:59.800 --> 41:02.120
Too bad about the rain.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.480
All the snow will be gone
    in the morning.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.480
The wassail's too strong
this year, huh, Mark?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.160
You know, the first year
     after Dad's death,

41:16.160 --> 41:20.160
we had a Christmas dinner
here instead of his house.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.240
Didn't seem right that I should
sit at the head of the table.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.600
          So you didn't.

41:26.600 --> 41:30.600
  But the next holiday, you did.

41:32.200 --> 41:36.200
I tried to keep busy with parties,
decorations, toasts.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.520
Christmas by the book.

41:40.520 --> 41:44.520
So I wouldn't have time to think.

41:44.520 --> 41:48.480
          About Stephen.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.280
I miss him so much!

41:50.280 --> 41:54.280
                    Oh, honey.

41:57.400 --> 42:01.040
We'll...we'll say a special prayer
tonight at the midnight service.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.720
Oh, no, I'm not going.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.760
I can't sit there celebrating
the birth of a God

42:05.760 --> 42:09.760
who is so arbitrary
and so mean-spirited,

42:09.920 --> 42:13.920
who asks you to serve him
without question...

42:15.160 --> 42:18.640
..who would take away my boy.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.400
   Mark, don't do this to yourself. &gt;

42:20.400 --> 42:23.200
   Mark, don't do this to yourself. &gt;
I'm not going.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.440
Come on, let's get
back to our guests.

42:25.440 --> 42:29.440
No.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.920
To hell with them.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.920
A  DOG BARKS

43:00.400 --> 43:04.400
OK. OK.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.400
Come here. Come here. Sit.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.200
Sit. Good boy.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.280
You missed one.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.160
DOOR BELL RINGS

43:18.160 --> 43:20.600
Dr Craig?

43:20.600 --> 43:24.000
Mrs Craig?

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
Barbara?

43:29.560 --> 43:33.000
Hello?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.920
Oh, well.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.920
# I wish me a Merry Christmas
I wish me a Merry Christmas... #

43:43.440 --> 43:46.280
For to you is born
this day in the city,

43:46.280 --> 43:50.280
David, a saviour
who is Christ the Lord.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.640
 And this will be a sign for you.

43:53.640 --> 43:57.160
You will find a babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes lying in a manger.

43:57.160 --> 44:01.160
And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host,

44:01.640 --> 44:05.640
praising God and saying,
"Glory to God in the highest,

44:06.960 --> 44:10.960
"and on Earth, peace among men
with whom He is pleased."

44:11.040 --> 44:15.040
