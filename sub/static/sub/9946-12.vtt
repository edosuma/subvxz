Oi! Kids needing money

00:26.158 --> 00:28.687
Cos' this people reckon,
and me included, is why

00:28.727 --> 00:33.147
pubs and drugs were kindly invented.

00:33.187 --> 00:36.896
To calm
us all down to stop us going mental.

No. I love these get-togethers.

03:14.963 --> 03:18.362
No. I love these get-togethers. You were
seen wearing a dress under your uniform.

03:18.402 --> 03:20.776

Oh, Little man!
What's your sob story?

Oh, he's narky with his mum for
dragging him out to put up her posters.

04:03.064 --> 04:05.522
Nice idea, lady.

04:05.532 --> 04:09.445
It's mad, what you think up at three in
the morning, when you're doing a feed.

04:11.687 --> 04:15.192

Give him some stick, Jock, or I'll never hear
the last of it. No, no, Maxine I believe in giving

04:47.943 --> 04:50.914
credit where it's due and
your man's made great progress.

04:50.954 --> 04:54.351
Of course, that's no good if
you can't see a punch coming!

04:54.361 --> 04:56.135
Still throwing the low-blows, Jock?

04:58.652 --> 05:00.934
Amazing what a lick of paint can do.

05:00.974 --> 05:05.007
We're definitely back on our feet
so if you don't mind,

05:05.047 --> 05:07.802
you can get off my case now, Paddy.

05:07.842 --> 05:11.577
Keep your guard up, Gallagher.

knew Paddy Maguire.

05:20.076 --> 05:21.321
Oh, yeah.

I've known him since he was a
whipper-snapper on the run from Belfast.

05:27.217 --> 05:30.361

Nah.

But still could, kind of.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.164
It's Frank.

05:47.204 --> 05:48.980
Not so "creative" any more.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.420
Shit. All the boozing
finally had an effect?

05:51.460 --> 05:55.045
No, his stomach's lined with
asbestos.

05:55.085 --> 05:57.201
He had the... after Stella.

05:57.241 --> 06:00.470
Frank Gallagher, denying mankind
his seed? I don't think so.

06:00.510 --> 06:02.234
Sadly, it's true.

06:02.244 --> 06:04.763
The most pain he's ever felt.

06:04.803 --> 06:06.523
Should see the scar.

06:06.563 --> 06:08.848
The one from the
electric shock to his balls?

06:08.888 --> 06:10.045
Huh?

06:10.085 --> 06:13.140
I've heard the stitches story
enough to know he would never

06:13.180 --> 06:14.539
let a doctor down there.

06:22.493 --> 06:26.950
You know vasectomies
can be reversed.

that successfully...

06:29.817 --> 06:35.185

stories... It's, it's uncomfortable.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.847
More uncomfortable than 100 volts

You never got snipped. Bastard.

06:43.005 --> 06:45.888
You told me that you couldn't,
biologically, so,

you know, a moment of compassion,
I told you I couldn't.

06:49.699 --> 06:53.177
But we can, artificially.
I froze my eggs, Frank.

06:53.217 --> 06:57.597
They're in a clinic,
asking to be fertilised.

06:57.637 --> 06:59.566

give me what I want.

06:59.576 --> 07:02.535

07:02.545 --> 07:05.448
Well, I'll just find
myself a real man then.

07:05.488 --> 07:07.621
Good luck.

Hey, you don't mess with nature.

08:10.763 --> 08:12.296
Right.

08:12.336 --> 08:14.116
I best decide then.

08:18.555 --> 08:20.728
That's why you lifted me earlier!

This is for me.

But... I thought...

13:27.354 --> 13:28.747
You liked?

13:39.451 --> 13:41.272
God bless librarians.

13:41.312 --> 13:44.037
This what you looking for?

13:44.077 --> 13:46.971
I was just checking
to see if this clinic's legit.

13:47.011 --> 13:52.447
There's a lot of quacks about, Lib,
preying on vulnerable women.

13:52.487 --> 13:54.348
Don't make out you care, Frank.

13:54.358 --> 13:56.126
I, I...

13:56.166 --> 13:58.187
You just want to scramble my eggs!

13:58.227 --> 14:00.212
I... I don...

14:01.855 --> 14:02.844
Oh!

14:03.963 --> 14:05.500
You've got a family here.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.230
Can't we just make do?

14:08.240 --> 14:09.490
She loves you to bits.

14:09.530 --> 14:13.633
What happens when she gets to
Liam's age, and she hates my guts?

14:13.673 --> 14:16.282
Why do you think
I want one of my own?

14:16.322 --> 14:18.723
CRASHING

14:18.763 --> 14:22.153
Liam! What happened?
Who's done that to your hair?

14:22.193 --> 14:26.620
Where is he? Where's my little man?
Say the word, and it's fucking war.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.902
Me and you, kid. Kelly's heroes.

14:28.942 --> 14:32.826
Sorry, we are trying to resolve
this sensibly, as a family.

14:32.866 --> 14:35.463
Where are you at
in your resolution?

14:35.503 --> 14:36.851
We're at cease fire.

14:36.891 --> 14:40.200
You're letting them off? This is the
Chatsworth, love. We do eye for eye.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.594
Yeah, so everyone's blinded?
Good example!

14:42.634 --> 14:44.791
For the love of God,
Liam's sitting there.

14:44.831 --> 14:47.383
Why don't you try
asking him what he wants?

14:47.423 --> 14:48.611
I just want it to stop.

14:56.047 --> 14:59.992
# Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon

15:00.032 --> 15:03.376
# You come and go

15:03.416 --> 15:06.790
# You come and go oh, oh, oh

15:06.830 --> 15:11.604
# Loving would be easy
if your colours were like my dreams

15:11.644 --> 15:15.439
# Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green... #

15:15.479 --> 15:17.738
How long have you been there?

15:17.748 --> 15:18.965
Long enough to know

15:19.005 --> 15:21.425
your ex was talking
out of his bum hole last night.

15:21.465 --> 15:22.880
Paddy was just showing off.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.690
He didn't mean any of it.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.303
It still hurt.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.024
He used to love my singing.

15:28.064 --> 15:29.796
Said I had the voice of an angel.

15:29.836 --> 15:31.560
Why care what he thinks?

15:31.570 --> 15:33.577
Can't just stop the habit
of a lifetime.

15:33.617 --> 15:35.477
I really think you should
enter the show.

15:37.262 --> 15:38.251
No.

15:39.912 --> 15:44.031
Nana's saving all her songs
for her new man.

15:44.071 --> 15:46.308
You have the luxury
of showing Micky the door.

15:46.318 --> 15:47.576
Not so easy for family.

15:47.616 --> 15:49.392
Did he say why I kicked him out?

15:49.432 --> 15:51.951
Nope. And seeing him
with that face and those bin bags

15:51.991 --> 15:53.350
didn't put me in a talky mood.

15:53.390 --> 15:55.008
Jock's a good man, Paddy.

15:55.048 --> 15:57.099
He can't do enough
for kids around here,

15:57.139 --> 15:58.998
and he lives for that boxing club.

15:59.038 --> 16:02.035
You know nothing about
that two-faced cunt.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.942
Just give him another week.

16:04.982 --> 16:07.774
A week?! I could give him a lifetime,
and he'd still default.

16:07.814 --> 16:11.541
He's shite with money, but he always
spends his way out of trouble.

16:11.581 --> 16:13.885
Now, does that seem sensible?

16:13.925 --> 16:16.392
No, it's naive.

16:16.432 --> 16:18.674
He's out of his depth.

16:18.714 --> 16:21.802
Tell him I'll be round tomorrow,
with a van, to gut the place.

16:25.087 --> 16:28.557
MOBILE PHONE BUZZING

16:33.993 --> 16:35.981
Don't be mad. Don't shout at me.

16:36.021 --> 16:37.420
Hiya, Dad, how's it going?

16:37.960 --> 16:39.748
Why's your phone been off, numpty?

16:39.788 --> 16:43.348
'Because I'm on an assessment course
for the fire brigade.'

16:43.388 --> 16:45.590
Yeah? That's not bad for you.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.758
Now, listen, get your arse over here,
I need you to find a van.

16:48.798 --> 16:51.680
No, I'm serious.
I'm going to be a fireman.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.498
You?

16:53.538 --> 16:54.560
Yeah.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.040
Do you have any references?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.470
If someone was asking me,

16:57.510 --> 16:59.596
I'd say you'd raised the bar
in bungling,

16:59.636 --> 17:02.360
and I only keep you cos you're cheap.
Fireman, my arse!

17:10.997 --> 17:14.602
LAUGHTER

17:14.642 --> 17:16.354
Bad reception, innit?

17:18.215 --> 17:19.826
Float... Sting.

17:19.866 --> 17:21.326
Are you hitting this hard
cos it's me?

17:21.366 --> 17:22.338
Are you hitting this hard
cos it's me? Too right.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.646
Boy's a quick learner.

17:27.686 --> 17:30.647
We'll get him working
on the footwork tomorrow.

17:30.687 --> 17:33.294
Paddy Maguire's coming
to shut you down tomorrow.

17:33.334 --> 17:35.067
He's got it in for you
for some reason.

17:35.107 --> 17:37.966
Hey, hey, hey! Keep your gloves up!

17:38.006 --> 17:39.845
D'you know who you're dealing with?

17:39.855 --> 17:41.049
Course I do.

17:41.089 --> 17:43.173
Then why get into debt?

17:43.213 --> 17:47.224
He said I could pay him back when
it was good for me. Mates rates.

17:47.264 --> 17:51.246
That man's always promised me
the earth and then let me down.

17:51.286 --> 17:53.690
He said you've got form
for throwing money at problems.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.237
This gym always comes first.

17:56.259 --> 17:58.819
Paddy Maguire was my great hope.

18:00.089 --> 18:04.156
He was raw,
but as tough as I've ever seen.

18:04.196 --> 18:05.919
He just couldn't be tamed.

18:07.571 --> 18:11.322
His father had just died.
He wanted to fight the world,

18:11.362 --> 18:14.224
go out in a blaze of glory,
just like him.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.033
And I took that anger...

18:17.604 --> 18:22.826
...and I showed him how to use it,
and I made him believe.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.928
But he didn't want to be a fighter.

18:29.336 --> 18:32.384
He just wanted to be feared.

18:32.424 --> 18:36.582
I know exactly
what I'm up against, son.

18:38.224 --> 18:39.256
Hey, Ches!

18:39.296 --> 18:41.599
Hey, hey, hey, all right, all right.

18:43.715 --> 18:44.853
Jock,

18:44.893 --> 18:46.618
Ricky Hatton, you still in touch?

18:46.658 --> 18:48.166
Sure, yeah, yeah.

18:48.206 --> 18:52.443
Get him to make an appearance! We'll
sell tickets and clear your debt.

18:52.483 --> 18:54.006
I, I can't ask him to do that.

18:54.046 --> 18:56.164
The lad's got too many commitments.

18:56.204 --> 18:57.276
Jock, stuff pride!

18:57.316 --> 18:59.679
Paddy's going to
clear this place out.

18:59.719 --> 19:02.208
Call the Hitman. I'll do the rest.

19:02.248 --> 19:04.728
Liam, One last piece
with your name on it.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.639
I'm wasting away!

19:08.256 --> 19:09.780
Yeah!

19:11.325 --> 19:13.602
Wait, wait.

19:13.642 --> 19:15.008
What can I do?

19:15.048 --> 19:18.502
You're trying too hard to be liked.
Nothing kids hate more.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.564
Thank you, mother.

19:19.604 --> 19:22.353
No, she's right, for once.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.385
Monica felt bad
after the first bunk,

19:24.425 --> 19:26.974
so she made a bit of an effort
to get onside, right?

19:27.014 --> 19:28.604
Yeah, then she fucked off again.

19:28.644 --> 19:31.816
Meaning, Liam's seen it all before.

19:31.856 --> 19:35.990
It's all about trust, yeah?
I've had to earn it, time and again.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.764
Nobody trusts you.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.194
How do I make that happen?

19:44.895 --> 19:47.799
Just stick around.

19:47.839 --> 19:49.687
Just be there for him.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.469
Come on, come on!

20:09.103 --> 20:11.344
Give it up, son.
You'll never make it.

20:14.607 --> 20:15.619
Oh! That's it!

20:17.980 --> 20:19.889
OK.

20:19.929 --> 20:21.425
Head right.

20:21.465 --> 20:22.392
Head right.
ALL: Head right.

20:23.416 --> 20:24.508
Extend the ladder.

20:25.617 --> 20:27.528
Well done, Maguire.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.417
Let's go.

20:33.457 --> 20:35.703
Great stuff there, that's it.

20:49.585 --> 20:53.337
Bring your giro money, cos we'll
be raffling off fight memorabilia.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.271
How much would you say you loved me?

20:56.311 --> 20:58.810
You want keep going
a bit more there, pal.

20:58.850 --> 21:01.856
I spoke to the hospital press
officer to make some calls.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.383
It's going out everywhere.
Papers, radio.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.649
Ricky Hatton's coming back
to Chatsworth to save his old club.

21:07.689 --> 21:09.421
No way!

21:09.461 --> 21:11.070
Fucking hell. Quality!

21:16.539 --> 21:17.257
Pint.

21:17.297 --> 21:18.269
Pint.
Sure.

21:29.534 --> 21:33.445
# Chatsworth's burning
Chatsworth's burning

21:33.485 --> 21:36.021
# Fetch the engine
Fetch the engine

21:36.061 --> 21:40.106
# Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!

21:40.146 --> 21:43.018
# Pour on water
Pour on water... #

21:44.079 --> 21:45.330
SCREAMS

21:46.526 --> 21:47.596
Whoooaaa!

21:47.606 --> 21:49.130
Do you think that's funny?

21:50.256 --> 21:53.612
Making me look stupid,
in front of all these people?

21:55.249 --> 21:57.644
I'm your son.

21:57.684 --> 22:02.318
Beat my drum, Dad, don't beat
me into the fucking ground.

22:02.358 --> 22:04.252
Take your foot off me head.

22:05.384 --> 22:09.084
Have you any idea
how much that hurts?

22:09.124 --> 22:11.666
Every time you put me down...

22:13.233 --> 22:15.405
...I bleed.

22:15.445 --> 22:18.795
I've got fucking scars
on top of scars, me.

22:21.437 --> 22:24.740
How am I meant to deal with that,
eh, Dad?

22:24.780 --> 22:27.074
Be a man and deal with it.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.666
Get him another drink.
You'll pass next time.

22:32.542 --> 22:33.622
Who says I failed?

22:36.802 --> 22:39.467
I'm going to be a fireman.

22:39.507 --> 22:41.788
But you'll always be a bitter cunt.

22:44.445 --> 22:45.981
Deal with that!

23:17.230 --> 23:18.221
Different class, Libby.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.031
Proud
to call that breakfast English.

23:20.271 --> 23:22.631
First for you,
not burning the rashers.

23:39.115 --> 23:42.406
You need to cut Libby
some slack, pal.

23:42.446 --> 23:45.432
Come on, do it for me.
I'd appreciate it.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.676
She's fucking broody, isn't she?

23:50.716 --> 23:52.077
That's disgusting.

23:52.087 --> 23:53.965
All right, easy!

23:53.975 --> 23:56.624
Listen, I'm with you.
I just think that if you

23:56.664 --> 24:00.151
were a bit more accepting,
she wouldn't be as needy.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.097
Libby.

24:05.137 --> 24:07.110
My guitar.

24:13.732 --> 24:15.711
Would you like a lift to school?

24:15.751 --> 24:17.735
Would you like a lift to school?
In a fucking ice-cream van?!

24:17.775 --> 24:19.559
I'll walk him in.

24:19.599 --> 24:20.466
Oh, the escort girl?

24:20.506 --> 24:21.353
I could always give it a miss?

24:21.393 --> 24:23.706
No way! No fucking danger!

24:23.746 --> 24:28.031
OK, Liam. Apart from jibbing school,
what would you prefer?

24:28.071 --> 24:31.717
I'll go on my own. It's my problem.
Maybe they'll get bored and give up.

24:43.745 --> 24:45.405
Get on. I'll give you a backy.

24:45.445 --> 24:46.921
Get on. I'll give you a backy.
Then what, another kicking?

24:46.961 --> 24:49.400
I'm trying to make up
for that. Hurry.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.485
Put your hands round me.

24:51.525 --> 24:54.741
Liam I don't want a wank.
You'll fall off otherwise.

24:54.781 --> 24:55.766
Just don't get your hopes up!

24:55.806 --> 24:57.758
Just don't get your hopes up!

24:57.798 --> 25:00.407
It's not my hopes
you need to worry about.

25:00.447 --> 25:02.750
BOYS SHOUT

25:04.953 --> 25:06.167
Left.

25:06.207 --> 25:08.182
Down a bit your end, lan.

25:08.192 --> 25:11.734
Lower, lower.

25:11.774 --> 25:14.157
Lower, lower.

25:17.672 --> 25:18.697
What you trying to say?!

25:18.737 --> 25:20.830
What you trying to say?!
It's shit.

25:20.870 --> 25:23.278
You fetch the punters in
and leave the look to me.

25:23.288 --> 25:25.379
Oi, you putting this up or what?

25:25.419 --> 25:27.964
Fancy a fuck, skinny boy?
Eh? (LAUGHS)

25:28.004 --> 25:30.013
You think you're fucking funny?

25:30.023 --> 25:30.906
Ches, just leave it out!
Leave it out!

25:30.946 --> 25:32.693
Ches, just leave it out!
Leave it out! What you saying?

25:32.703 --> 25:33.716
Do that again,
I'll cave your face in!

25:33.756 --> 25:35.103
Do that again, I'll cave
your face in! Walk with me!

25:35.143 --> 25:35.741
Fuck off!

25:35.751 --> 25:36.809
Fuck off!
Carl, don't!

25:36.849 --> 25:38.257
Fuck off! Carl, don't!
No fighting in here!

25:38.297 --> 25:39.155
What, in a boxing club?

25:39.195 --> 25:42.197
What, in a boxing club? What the
fuck's all the shouting about? Nothing.

25:42.237 --> 25:43.676
Everything's fine.

25:46.364 --> 25:49.686
I don't want to fight him anyway,
he's my best mate.

25:54.532 --> 25:58.208
When all that shit happened,
you had them there for ya.

25:58.218 --> 26:00.376
Who did I have?

26:00.416 --> 26:01.824
Me.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.917
I've always got your back, bruv.

26:04.957 --> 26:07.499
Look, we're here for you, Chesney.
Any time.

26:13.870 --> 26:15.723
He had no right
having a go at me.

26:15.763 --> 26:18.005
I've never stood in the
way of any of my kids.

26:18.045 --> 26:19.944
Never encouraged them either.

26:19.984 --> 26:21.755
Stopped supporting altogether.

26:21.795 --> 26:25.249
D'you even know the meaning
of family any more?

26:25.259 --> 26:28.988
There's benefits to having
a fireman in the family, though.

26:29.028 --> 26:32.708
We'll pass the health and safety
every time.

26:35.609 --> 26:38.533
Bit rich, hitting me
with the family stick...

26:40.251 --> 26:43.038
...when you fucked off
and we were all over the place.

26:44.225 --> 26:48.133
Fine. Let's get together later,
the lot of us,

26:48.173 --> 26:53.018
and you can watch me murder a song
in the talent show. That sound good?

26:53.058 --> 26:55.443
Right. D'you want the bad news
or the bad news?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.531
Right. D'you want the bad news or
the bad news? Don't start, Micky.

26:57.571 --> 27:01.207
Go on, son.
Give us your assessment.

27:01.217 --> 27:03.389
As your appointed
Fire Safety Officer,

27:03.429 --> 27:06.411
it is my duty to highlight hazards
and make recommendations.

27:06.451 --> 27:07.872
Such as?

27:07.912 --> 27:10.798
Closing down.
The place is a death-trap.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.540
You need to act now
or there will be casualties.

27:16.537 --> 27:17.834
You what?

27:20.063 --> 27:24.150
Right. You've just been promoted
to Talent Show Superintendent.

27:24.190 --> 27:30.041
Fix the problems, monitor the
acts tonight and then we'll, um...

27:30.081 --> 27:32.009
We'll get you a new tabard.

27:47.557 --> 27:49.605
You've only gone and done it, champ.

27:51.245 --> 27:53.857
Let's wait till the
real star shows up, eh?

27:53.897 --> 27:57.388
Ricky's the ultimate showman.
He'll be building anticipation.

27:57.428 --> 28:00.347
I just hope he feels at home
in his Hatton Wonderland.

28:00.357 --> 28:03.680
I'll check on Jock. He's a bag
of fucking nerves back there.

28:03.690 --> 28:05.367
Good job you're on the money, eh?

28:05.407 --> 28:06.523
All right, Joe?

28:06.563 --> 28:09.361
Hatton! Hatton!

28:09.401 --> 28:13.309
(CROWD CHANT) Hatton! Hatton!

28:14.808 --> 28:17.667
"You're such a chancer.

28:17.707 --> 28:20.445
Just staying one step ahead
of everyone else, Karen.

28:20.485 --> 28:23.288
Life's all about making
the most of your opportunities.

28:23.328 --> 28:26.451
But how far are you
prepared to go, Joe?

28:28.504 --> 28:29.766
You'd take Ricky Hatton?

28:29.806 --> 28:31.538
You'd take Ricky Hatton?
He'd kill you, one punch.

28:31.578 --> 28:35.039
I'm saying, if we met down an alley
while he was in between fights...

28:35.079 --> 28:37.984
Bang, bang, bang! I don't think
he'd live with my lightning jab.

28:38.024 --> 28:39.158
Undefeated in the ring.

28:39.198 --> 28:41.851
Undefeated in the ring. You got
sparked out, your last fight.

28:41.891 --> 28:45.009
For money. If Paddy Maguire says
to take a dive, you hit the deck.

28:45.049 --> 28:49.764
Why don't you show this lot that jab?
Exhibition match, till Ricky shows?

28:50.957 --> 28:53.318
Nah, you're all right.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.367
Wuss.

28:54.407 --> 28:56.756
Marquee act, not performing monkey.

28:58.950 --> 29:00.723
I'll do it.
Stick me in the ring.

29:00.763 --> 29:02.135
No. I'll get one
of the members to do it.

29:02.145 --> 29:04.585
No. I'll get one of the members
to do it. Lan, I can do it.

29:04.625 --> 29:08.134
It's too soon. There's nobody
your standard or weight.

29:09.819 --> 29:10.931
What about him?

29:10.971 --> 29:12.530
What about him?
Nails?

29:12.570 --> 29:14.430
I'll tag-team if you're struggling.

29:16.553 --> 29:19.599
Oh, it's Wales all over again.

29:19.639 --> 29:22.648
BELL RINGS, CROWD CHEERS

29:41.924 --> 29:44.358
Right! Get in that corner!

29:50.924 --> 29:53.668
You all right? Yeah?
You sure you're OK?

29:53.708 --> 29:54.885
Yeah?

30:26.009 --> 30:27.567
CHEERING

30:36.248 --> 30:38.341
Woo!

30:49.199 --> 30:50.860
Ricky sends his apologies.
It's nobody's fault.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.737
Ricky sends his apologies. It's
nobody's fault. Load of bollocks.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.066
Lan...

31:03.106 --> 31:06.326
Jock doesn't even know Hatton.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.518
What?

31:07.558 --> 31:09.886
Lad fought here once as an amateur.

31:09.896 --> 31:11.438
Gobshite's been
spinning that story since.

31:11.478 --> 31:12.849
Gobshite's been spinning that
story since. That's rubbish.

31:12.889 --> 31:16.663
I drank with the boy.

31:16.703 --> 31:20.872
Got him a pint to ask to name the
gym after him, the fucking user.

31:23.080 --> 31:27.641
What were you thinking, Jock? Why did
you let me go through with it?

31:27.681 --> 31:30.362
I didn't know it was
going to get like this, did I?

31:30.372 --> 31:36.864
All this press and the radio. And you were
so up to it, and you'd been so supportive.

31:36.904 --> 31:38.843
I didn't have it in me
to let you down!

31:38.883 --> 31:41.191
I didn't have it in me to let you
down! Shite! You don't care about him.

31:41.231 --> 31:44.158
It's only ever about you,
you pathetic fucking traitor.

31:44.198 --> 31:46.757
Paddy, no! Leave him! No!
Look, leave him!

31:46.797 --> 31:50.295
He's done. You've won. It's over.

31:54.864 --> 31:57.072
I'm going to leave you
as you left me -

31:57.082 --> 31:59.209
without a hope
in the fucking world!

32:02.429 --> 32:04.454
This is it, Maguire.

32:05.794 --> 32:07.523
Pass this, you're one of us.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.929
Come on, mate. Fucking show 'em.

32:10.939 --> 32:13.023
DOOR SLAMS

32:13.063 --> 32:13.660
What's going on?

32:13.700 --> 32:15.736
What's going on?
It's all part of the test.

32:15.776 --> 32:18.375
Working in confined spaces, go on.

32:19.518 --> 32:23.412
'Are you stuck there son, hmmm?
Struggling? '

32:23.452 --> 32:25.541
Oh, he's gone.

32:25.551 --> 32:27.425
Get out of my head.

32:27.465 --> 32:31.087
If you're in difficulty,
raise your hand.

32:31.127 --> 32:33.638
(FATHER'S VOICE MUFFLED)
Raise your hand.

32:33.678 --> 32:36.812
(TO HIMSELF) Just stay calm
and you're in.

32:38.044 --> 32:40.831
You're running out of time, Maguire.

32:45.385 --> 32:48.785
'Daddy's here,

32:48.825 --> 32:50.969
'just say the word.'

32:54.828 --> 32:57.251
You can do this.

33:01.725 --> 33:03.488
Believe.

33:09.687 --> 33:13.202
MUSIC PLAYS

33:23.092 --> 33:24.387
Why is your dad so fucking bitter?

33:25.427 --> 33:28.313
We need more people like you
to stand up to the fucker.

33:28.353 --> 33:30.696
It's not worth it.
There'll only ever be one winner.

33:30.736 --> 33:32.208
Says the trainee fireman?

33:32.248 --> 33:35.063
APPLAUSE

33:46.356 --> 33:48.005
They're rubbish compared to you.

33:48.045 --> 33:49.044
Popular, though.

33:49.084 --> 33:50.178
We all loved Feral.

33:50.218 --> 33:52.075
Give them some competition.
Make yourself popular.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.024
If I did it my way,
I'd get destroyed.

33:54.364 --> 33:57.194
Crap. It's OK to dance differently.

33:57.234 --> 33:58.685
But what did the judges think?

33:58.695 --> 34:01.410
A trillion percent yes!

34:01.450 --> 34:04.186
That's what this competition
is all about.

34:05.207 --> 34:06.545
Thank you, Patty.

34:06.585 --> 34:08.674
Just be who you are.

34:08.684 --> 34:13.199
OK, here is Flame Phil.
Woo-ha!

34:16.647 --> 34:19.168
Was it good, then?

34:19.208 --> 34:20.591
Making Jock suffer?

34:23.728 --> 34:27.753
Why even give him a loan if you hate
his guts and knew he'd default on it?

34:27.793 --> 34:30.708
Lan, how do you think
lenders make money?

34:30.748 --> 34:33.960
By making a fucking killing
out of failure.

34:34.001 --> 34:35.875
Yeah, well, you'd know all
about that, wouldn't you?

34:35.915 --> 34:37.886
Sorry?

34:37.926 --> 34:41.969
You enjoy watching people fuck up.
You pick on them till they do.

34:42.010 --> 34:44.623
I think you do it to feel
better about yourself.

34:44.664 --> 34:46.159
Walk away, lan. While you can.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.909
How much for that boxing gear?

34:47.949 --> 34:49.471
What?

34:49.511 --> 34:50.972
What?
I'll buy it back off ya.

34:52.618 --> 34:55.266
Let it go, son.
You don't have that kind of money.

34:55.306 --> 34:56.985
A grand.

34:57.025 --> 34:58.248
It's worth treble.

34:58.288 --> 35:00.880
It's worth treble.
And it's used. 1,500.

35:00.920 --> 35:01.938
Why the fuck are you doing this?

35:01.978 --> 35:04.375
I want to keep the boxing club open.

35:04.415 --> 35:08.100
It might not have suited you,
but it's been good to me.

35:08.140 --> 35:11.827
Is that what you heard? Is that what
Jock told you - it didn't suit me?

35:11.867 --> 35:13.551
Yeah.

35:13.591 --> 35:15.792
Cos you never wanted to fight fair.

35:19.633 --> 35:21.593
You'll be pouring it down the drain.

35:21.633 --> 35:23.268
That club's jinxed.

35:23.308 --> 35:25.031
(AUDIENCE) Woo!

35:32.860 --> 35:35.137
Jock doesn't deserve
a fucking lifeline.

35:35.147 --> 35:38.555
I'm not doing it for him.
I'm doing it for lads like me.

CROWD APPLAUDS

36:23.172 --> 36:25.072
Thanks, Micky.
Sorry about that.

36:34.270 --> 36:36.477
Have you decided what you're
gonna sing yet?

36:37.858 --> 36:40.781
You really know chuff-all about
kids! Liam's rivals are here.

36:40.821 --> 36:43.941
Snidey little bastards.
They'll crucify him.

36:43.981 --> 36:45.809
I know. I didn't put him up to it.

36:45.849 --> 36:47.405
I'll try and talk him out of it.

36:47.445 --> 36:48.736
Wait. Let me.

36:51.899 --> 36:55.198
(DROWNED OUT BY CHEERS)

37:01.191 --> 37:04.908
You've never performed in front of
the family, let alone the Chatsworth.

37:04.948 --> 37:06.823
And you can't make a guitar hip-hop.

37:06.863 --> 37:09.224
Did you fix this so I'd play
again, or to score points?

37:09.264 --> 37:10.974
No!

37:11.014 --> 37:15.606
I mean, of course I want you to play,
for yourself.

37:15.646 --> 37:19.749
I care. I care about all of you.
Even your bloody dad!

37:19.789 --> 37:21.695
Why? He's rubbish at everything.

37:21.735 --> 37:23.206
And as soon as you
realise that, you'll leave.

37:23.246 --> 37:24.725
And as soon as you realise
that, you'll leave. I won't.

37:24.765 --> 37:27.366
I know what I've bought into.

37:27.376 --> 37:29.649
It may not seem perfect, but what is?

37:29.689 --> 37:32.243
God, look at the baggage I lug about.

37:34.025 --> 37:36.178
I think we both need each other.

37:36.218 --> 37:39.233
Why not give us a chance, eh?

37:39.273 --> 37:42.729
Now our next act must really
fancy his chances,

37:42.769 --> 37:44.163
playing acoustic guitar.

37:44.203 --> 37:45.347
You don't need to do this, love!

37:45.387 --> 37:46.395
You don't need to do this, love!
Yeah, I do.

37:46.405 --> 37:50.243

Fucking stupid bastard!

# Hold your head up high... #

40:11.558 --> 40:14.425
Well done! That's the winner!
Congratulations.

40:14.465 --> 40:16.920
HALF-HEARTED APPLAUSE

40:16.960 --> 40:18.182
You put them up to this?

40:20.112 --> 40:23.024
That's your idea
of bleeding support?!

40:24.930 --> 40:29.605
# And don't be afraid

40:29.645 --> 40:33.260
# Of the dark... #

40:33.300 --> 40:35.273
Jock. It's lan. Hold on,
we'll get you out of there!

40:35.313 --> 40:37.329
Lan, no! It's not safe. Tell him!

40:37.369 --> 40:38.728
Noooo!

40:39.788 --> 40:44.987
# At the end of the storm

40:46.568 --> 40:48.069
# Is a golden sky

# Of the lark

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:38.253 --> 42:40.653
You don't deserve
friends like these.

42:43.234 --> 42:46.775
What the fuck
happened between you two?

42:46.815 --> 42:48.072
Will you tell him, or shall I?

42:58.048 --> 42:59.966
It was a long time ago.

43:00.006 --> 43:03.654
And neither of us came
out of it with any credit.

43:03.694 --> 43:05.874
Doesn't matter.

43:05.914 --> 43:07.011
Needs telling.

43:09.891 --> 43:11.503
Bastard hung me out to dry.

43:11.543 --> 43:14.189
Said he'd taken me
as far as he could,

43:14.199 --> 43:16.068
but he was lying out of his arse.

43:16.108 --> 43:20.997
He was being bankrolled by gangsters,
and when they needed muscle,

43:21.037 --> 43:22.874
they got the best of his stable.

43:24.477 --> 43:25.978
That Judas...

43:27.940 --> 43:30.606
...gave me up,

43:30.646 --> 43:35.202
after treating me like...
f-f-fucking...

43:37.513 --> 43:40.040
I tried to send you
back to your mother.

43:40.050 --> 43:44.152
I couldn't go back to Belfast.
I was a dead man there!

43:44.192 --> 43:45.928
You knew that.

43:45.938 --> 43:48.977
Knew I wanted away from that shite.
You should have stuck up for me.

43:48.987 --> 43:52.003
But you dropped me right
back in it, you weak fuck.

43:52.043 --> 43:54.221
I was just a boy.

43:56.364 --> 43:59.112
I was never gonna be
good enough to be a contender,

43:59.152 --> 44:02.283
but I had a shot at being decent.

44:02.323 --> 44:03.739
Not bad.

44:06.490 --> 44:09.152
Instead, I've just
been a fucking letdown.

44:12.975 --> 44:15.034
I'm so sorry, son.

44:18.926 --> 44:21.577
I'm not gonna be a fireman.

44:25.034 --> 44:26.490
I failed.

44:28.194 --> 44:29.752
My last test.

44:35.422 --> 44:36.878
I lied.

44:40.244 --> 44:42.326
I just...

44:45.108 --> 44:48.373
I just wanted to get
one over on you, Dad.

44:56.035 --> 44:58.139
Fuck sake, son, who cares?

45:01.613 --> 45:04.306
You're a hero.

45:04.346 --> 45:05.955
Better man than I'll ever fucking be.

45:11.987 --> 45:14.189
'I never used to know
what people meant

45:14.229 --> 45:16.902
'when they said,
"I don't feel meself."

45:16.942 --> 45:20.565
'I'd be like,
"Really, not even a tickle?"

45:22.517 --> 45:27.272
'I had no idea it was about how
happy they were, in themselves.

45:35.843 --> 45:38.328
'Confidence is like love, innit?

45:38.368 --> 45:40.480
'We all want some,
but it's hard to hold on to.

45:40.520 --> 45:43.121
'Some get lucky. They're born sure.

45:43.131 --> 45:45.782
'Bastards.

45:48.044 --> 45:51.309
'Others find their feet eventually,
after a lot of tumbles.

45:54.668 --> 45:57.969
'And then there's them ones who
get a buzz when they achieve stuff.

45:58.009 --> 45:59.158
'But they're up and down.

45:59.198 --> 46:03.028
'The rest have one good day
where they can take on the world,

46:03.068 --> 46:05.869
'but mostly crap ones.

46:05.909 --> 46:09.348
'Thing is, since I started
believing a bit more,

46:09.388 --> 46:12.140
'I have been "feeling myself",

46:12.180 --> 46:15.044
'fucking loads.

46:15.084 --> 46:16.488
'And it feels mega! '

A prisoner in your own body, your
only escape, your only release.

46:25.812 --> 46:28.450
In your dreams. Maybe miracles
don't just happen to other people.

46:28.490 --> 46:29.931
Shit!

46:29.971 --> 46:32.875
Your dad's in the Jockey.

46:32.915 --> 46:34.736
Count this as a warning,
Daddy dearest.

46:34.776 --> 46:35.942
Or what?

46:37.640 --> 46:41.524
I'm sick of being told what to do!
Now you're gonna do some listening!

46:41.564 --> 46:43.583
Father Francis. Here for the cure.

46:44.628 --> 46:46.425
Jesus!
