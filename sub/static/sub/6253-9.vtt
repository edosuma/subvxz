10:24.541 --> 10:26.122
You gave me a footnote.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.209
You deserve it.
Well, thank you.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.958
Wow. Now, let me give you
a little piece of advice.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.040
You’ve been published.
Excellent.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.671
Nowjust, you know,
relax and enjoy it.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.469
That’s not how it works.
I gotta figure out my next project.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.387
Academia’s a bitch, bro.

10:48.232 --> 10:51.269
When was the last time
any of you saw Santiago?
[Woman ] Two weeks ago.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.318
My husband has been in St. Louis
for two months.

10:54.404 --> 10:58.022
A woman needs to be
appreciated occasionally.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.277
After cutting up oranges
for soccer practice,

11:00.369 --> 11:03.281
there was nothing like
getting blown out by Santiago.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.533
[Murmurs]

11:05.624 --> 11:09.116
Huh. Uh, so you were—
you were all then,

11:09.211 --> 11:12.669
uh, appreciated by Mr. Valmont?

11:12.756 --> 11:14.997
- And none of you were jealous?
- We each had our own
appointments.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.879
I had him every Wednesday
and Friday at 5:00.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.961
l was Thursdays at 1:00...

11:20.055 --> 11:22.262
before picking up the kids
for soccer practice.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.183
You know, it’s very rare not to
feel proprietary when involved
in an intimate relationship.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.976
Well, someone was jealous.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.678
His Saturday appointment.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.229
Bitch always demanded the 6:00.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.852
Why would that matter?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.854
It’s the last appointment
of the day.

11:34.987 --> 11:37.854
There’s no rush.
It’s good planning.
Uh-huh.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.439
But Santiago started complaining
about her last month.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.241
Said she was getting
crazy and jealous.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.286
- Did he mention a name?
- No, he respected our privacy.

11:46.373 --> 11:50.207
We respected his.
Right, girls?

11:50.294 --> 11:52.455
Mm-hmm.

11:56.508 --> 12:00.296
I can’t believe he’s dead.
He was my best stylist.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.628
My first hire
when I opened the place.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.055
Well, he had a regular client
on Saturdays at 6:00.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.757
We need to know
who that was.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.844
l have no idea.
He booked his own appointments.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.145
He wanted to keep
his clients confidential.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.813
Because he was
having sex with them?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.983
Did you know about that?

12:16.069 --> 12:20.483
Look, if you wanna know
about Santiago’s clients,
ask Theo, his shampoo boy.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.532
He’s over at Santiago’s station.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.109
l have a salon to run.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.535
Of course you do.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.784
Shampoo boy, huh?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.706
[Woman ]
We’re gonna wash your hair.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.499
Excuse me. Hey. F.B.l.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.953
I need to ask you some questions
about Santiago.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.710
Oh, God.
Something’s wrong, isn’t it?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.415
Santiago’s not playing hooky.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.673
He’s dead, Theo.
Santiago was murdered.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.973
No, that-that— that can’t be.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.385
- Kevin.
- Who?

12:51.480 --> 12:55.644
Kevin has been
trying to get his station
for the past two years.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.726
-Think he’d kill for that chair?
-You people have something
you want to say to me?

12:58.820 --> 13:01.277
Santiago’s been murdered.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.857
Well, if there is any justice,
it was that poor girl he made
look like a skunk.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.533
Let’s just focus.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.327
We’re looking for a client
who had Santiago’s 6:00
appointment on Saturday.

13:09.414 --> 13:13.657
I leave at 5:00 on Saturdays,
so, if he had a private client,
I wouldn’t know.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.868
Oh, please!

13:16.880 --> 13:18.996
Hey, what are you doing?

13:19.091 --> 13:21.082
Hey, that’s his private—

13:23.595 --> 13:25.210
Now you don’t need a warrant.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.968
You’re welcome, G-man.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.936
Look at this, huh?
A tip envelope.

13:35.023 --> 13:39.107
“You’re mine, darlin’.
Don’t forget it. XOXO. Ruby.”

13:39.194 --> 13:41.560
Maybe he didn’t live up
to his side of the bargain.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.789
Santiago was my stylist,
and I gave him a tip.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.412
I don’t see what the big deal is.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.916
My dad was a barber.
The biggest tip he ever got
was a glazed ham, okay?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.589
He got a thousand dollars.
That’s gotta mean something.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.712
He was a really,
really good stylist.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.339
Ruby, we know
all about Santiago.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.921
We know
that he was sleeping
with his clients.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.600
l was more than just a client.
I loved him.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.177
He knew that.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.058
You loved him? Right.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.767
So I’m sure the idea
of him sharing other women
really bothered you, huh?

14:20.861 --> 14:23.523
But I would never
do anything to hurt him.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.820
I gave him the money
to help him.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.819
He had debts from—

14:28.910 --> 14:30.616
from buying drugs.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.446
It’s the only reason
why he was messing around
with those skanks—

14:33.582 --> 14:35.368
’cause he was high.
What kind of drugs?

14:35.459 --> 14:38.417
Weed, pills, some cocaine
every now and then.

14:38.545 --> 14:42.037
Okay, so you made sure
he was supplied?
No! God, no!

14:42.132 --> 14:45.795
l was trying to get him into
treatment, but he wanted to
get his dealer off his back.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.295
l was trying to save him,
not kill him.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.602
The stuff is blue,
and he was a hairdresser.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.854
So, it’s gotta be Barbicide.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.898
And Barbicide
is flammable, right?
Yes.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.856
But it doesn’t contain
meta-diaminotoluene.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.078
Okay, so, if the blue stuff degraded,
we’ll never know what it was?

15:12.162 --> 15:15.825
Well, maybe, if you were dealing
with an average scientist.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.829
I, however, have discovered
that the color component here,
it didn’t degrade.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.411
It’s an unusual formulation
of copper salts...

15:22.506 --> 15:26.920
frequently used to clean
and disinfect pools
and-and fountains.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.843
Yeah, but he wasn’t
found anywhere near
a pool or a fountain.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.216
I know. That’s the problem.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.642
Ah, Miss Montenegro,
there you are.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.722
Oh, Arastoo.
Congratulations!

15:41.817 --> 15:44.229
- You weren’t supposed
to tell anyone.
- I didn’t.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.565
Well, she’s my wife,
so that doesn’t count.

15:48.657 --> 15:49.988
Where—
Where is that written?

15:50.075 --> 15:53.238
- It’s common knowledge.
- Oh. Okay then.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.239
Thank you.
But don’t tell anyone else.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.241
I might have an idea
for my next paper.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.699
“New Insights
into Forensic Odontology.”
Pretty exciting, huh?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.376
Yeah, yeah.
Let me catch my breath.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.421
I’m taking Mikrosil molds
of the scavengers’ teeth.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.544
| theorize that if
we can scan the bones,

16:08.635 --> 16:11.718
then input the exact dentition
of each scavenger,

16:11.805 --> 16:15.172
we should be able to use
the Angelatron to strip away
their teeth marks,

16:15.267 --> 16:17.929
leaving only those injuries
that might point to an assault.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.395
That’s interesting.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.472
It’s a little crazy,
but it’s interesting.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.649
- So you’ll help?
- Yeah.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.647
As long as I don’t have
to touch those things.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.162
Thanks, Cam.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.158
So, Cam’s tox screen confirms
that Santiago had drugs in his system.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.535
All right.
So, Saturday at 6:00
was telling the truth.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.535
Looks like it.
So why are we heading
to, uh, Little India?

16:44.629 --> 16:47.746
Santiago’s last credit card charge
was for a parking meter there...

16:47.841 --> 16:50.674
in front of an import store
that was busted for drugs last year.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.796
Okay, hold on.
Shouldn’t you have just taken a right?

16:52.888 --> 16:55.630
Oh, no.
My car’s got the Entune system.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.885
Finds the best route, least traffic.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.512
So, we’re driving in a robot?

16:59.603 --> 17:01.343
Yes, my robot friend, Camry.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.178
He calls me Dave.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.559
That— That is incredibly geeky of you.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.733
- You got the reference,
so what does that mean?
- Whoa. Look at that.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.399
You get sports scores
on this thing too?
Uh-huh.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.151
I slept in here one night
after Daisy and I had a fight...

17:14.242 --> 17:16.699
and hated to leave
when we made up.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.448
So, how— how are things
with you and Dr. Brennan?

17:19.581 --> 17:21.242
Fine. Absolutely fine.
Yeah?

17:21.333 --> 17:23.790
I’m not sleeping in my car if that’s
what you’re trying to get at.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.836
Ooh. It’s quite common
to experience a lull in
sexual activity after a baby.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.003
Stop.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.710
Okay.
Stop. Okay?

17:31.801 --> 17:34.008
We’re fine. Everything’s great.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.752
We’re better than fine.
Mmm.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.634
| just want you to know
that I’m here if you need me
for anything.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.972
Not— Okay, not anything.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.769
|-| wasn’t referring to—

17:44.856 --> 17:46.642
My last statement
wasn’t tied to my—

17:46.733 --> 17:49.019
You know what?
You’re just gonna let me
keep going, aren’t you?

17:49.110 --> 17:52.398
Absolutely. Hopefully,
your little robot car here
will be able to bail you out.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.150
[Sighs]

17:54.241 --> 17:55.822
No, it doesn’t do that.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.115
This was Mr. Vaziri’s idea?

18:01.206 --> 18:05.199
Yeah. This is a digital scan
of Santiago’s skeleton.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.080
And the smaller windows
show the dentition...

18:08.171 --> 18:09.786
from the scavengers
that Arastoo gathered.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.169
So this allows you to remove
all the postmortem trauma?

18:13.301 --> 18:16.668
Ingenious.
If it works.

18:21.184 --> 18:24.176
How did you feel
after you had Michael?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.145
I’m guessing you don’t mean
the joy and happiness...

18:28.233 --> 18:29.894
and ovenNhelming love.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.818
No, that part I like very much.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.605
Oh. Your old clothes don’t fit, right?

18:36.700 --> 18:39.692
Oh, God. I can’t get comfortable
in anything.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.277
Booth doesn’t understand.
He tries, but—

18:42.372 --> 18:43.908
Men cannot understand.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.990
lt scares them
when we talk about clothing.

18:46.084 --> 18:50.293
You should buy yourself
some new clothes and-and
give yourself a spa day.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.167
Well, l-l’m too busy.
We don’t even have
cause of death yet.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.624
Wait a minute.
You just grew a human.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.960
Someone should be
throwing you a parade.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.591
Getting some new clothes
and a facial, I mean—

19:00.682 --> 19:02.297
that seems like
the least you deserve.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.928
How’s it goin’?

19:04.019 --> 19:06.055
Congratulations, Mr. Vaziri.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.011
Oh. Thank you.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.721
Y-You weren’t supposed to know.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.099
[ Beeping ]
Why would you
keep this from me?

19:12.193 --> 19:15.606
Oh, this. I thought you meant
my article in the Journal
of Forensic Anthropology.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.358
No one is supposed
to know about that.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.690
Then why did you just tell me?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.450
Right.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.870
So, you like what I did here?
l was thinking it could be another paper.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.790
Yeah, it’s actually working out
better than I thought.

19:28.877 --> 19:32.119
Here. Look at these marks.
These weren’t made by animals.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.464
Can you enhance them?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.919
Oh, this is awesome.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.005
No, it is merely helpful.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.762
Do not discount
what you can learn from touch
and careful observation.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.720
- So, this is cause of death?
- No.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.851
These marks aren’t deep enough
or close enough to any of the
arteries that could be severed.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.398
Perhaps not,

19:54.486 --> 19:58.229
but the linear cut marks
on the side of the cranium
tell us a lot,

19:58.323 --> 20:00.188
don’t they, Mr. Vaziri?

20:00.283 --> 20:02.069
- They do?
- Yes.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.448
There are micro-incisions
here and here.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.120
That’s why the victim’s
hair was missing.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.991
He was scalped.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.712
,/‘,r [ Background: lno’ian Pop]

20:21.429 --> 20:24.967
Like I said, Sweets, the owner
was arrested for selling drugs
last year, okay?

20:25.058 --> 20:27.720
So Santiago
could’ve been killed
in a drug deal gone bad.

20:27.811 --> 20:31.053
Well, I never heard
of a drug dealer
scalping anyone, huh?

20:31.147 --> 20:34.639
A ritualistic killing
doesn’t seem so odd now,
does it?

20:34.776 --> 20:36.892
Ooh!
Hey. What’s goin’ down,
good people?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.147

We’re looking to get some
information on this guy.
Santiago Valmont.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.910
He was spotted here last Tuesday.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.124
Nah, man. I never heard of him.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.698
Really?

20:51.793 --> 20:54.455
We know that you were busted
last year for selling drugs, Poorab.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.252
No, man. No, no, man.
I’m clean, man.

Yo, I’m, like,
“in the program” clean, man.

Damn.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.053
Here you go.
Right there.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.433
This dude’s rockin’
straight-up woman hair.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.353
He’s actually rockin’
no hair at the moment.
He’s dead.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.440
Oh, man, dude. Ugh.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.485
You know what, man?
Yo, my brother, he was workin’
on Tuesday night, right?

21:20.572 --> 21:23.735
He’s in the back makin’ samosas.
I’m-a go get him for you. All right?

21:23.825 --> 21:27.909
Yo, Ronnie!
Hey, man, time to do
some public service, bro.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.902
Agent Booth?
Yeah.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.488
Blue liquid.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.868
The stuff
he was doused in, huh?
Mm-hmm.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.466
Poorab!

21:41.551 --> 21:43.337
[Grunts]

21:43.428 --> 21:44.759
Hey!

21:47.974 --> 21:50.386
[ Grunts ]
All right.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.843
[ Man ] Wow, man.
Did you see
what happened?

21:52.937 --> 21:55.269
Are they cops?
Booth.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.399
Look at that.
That’s a lot of hair.
Yeah.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.398
I don’t think Santiago was
the only one who got scalped.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.949
Okay, great.
Just let me know when
he has his P.D., okay?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.742
Great. Thanks.
Poorab won’t talk?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.825
No, not till he has
his public defender.
This is not what I need.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.457
I got so much
on my plate right now.
I don’t need his grief.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.204
Who? Dr. Brennan?
Huh?

22:21.299 --> 22:22.789
It’s a communication issue,
isn’t it?

22:22.884 --> 22:25.671
You know what, Sweets?
My life is not a game show, all right?

22:25.762 --> 22:28.879
You know, if you don’t deal
with communication issues
right away,

22:28.973 --> 22:32.386
they can fester
and cause serious damage
to a relationship.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.809
It’s not that. ljust—
[ Sighs ]

22:34.896 --> 22:38.559
Look, I think she’s feeling
a little unattractive
since having the baby.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.556
That’s all.
Oh!

22:40.652 --> 22:41.767
“Oh” what?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.897
It’s very common
for a— a new mother...

22:43.988 --> 22:46.400
to experience
a certain degree
of body dysmorphism.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.981
Dysma— What?

22:48.117 --> 22:49.823
Dysmorphism.
Dysmorphism?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.447
Dysmorphism.
What is that?

22:51.538 --> 22:53.620
It’s a condition related
to body image.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.205
Have you told her lately
that she looks—
Of course!

22:56.292 --> 22:58.874
And she does, all right?
All the time I’m telling her
she looks great.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.705
But I just think
that she feels like I’m
shining her on. That’s all.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.040
You need to show her
that she’s wrong.

23:05.134 --> 23:09.969
Buy her something
that, you know, makes her
feel... beautiful.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.050
Cupcakes?
Lingerie.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.850
|— Oh.

23:16.938 --> 23:19.224
It’s a lingerie store.

23:19.357 --> 23:22.190
You gotta be kiddin’ me.
Women love lingerie.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.268
| buy it for Daisy
all the time.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.282
You know I’m right.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.864
All right.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.692
There we go.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.821
Sequins, colors.
These are crotchless.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.248
Crotchless. I think
you know a little bit
too much about this.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.372
Daisy’s adventurous.
Huh?

23:42.505 --> 23:44.962
Huh?
You know what? This—
This is a bad idea.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.789
Let’s go.
What?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.296
Perhaps this bralette
is more to your liking.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.595
It comes with these delicious panties.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.388
Ooh.
[Chuckles]

23:54.475 --> 23:56.340
Um, I’m just looking.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.597
If you want something
more intimate—

23:58.730 --> 24:00.686
No!
Yeah, he does.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.764
- What size is she?
- Well, I don’t know.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.440
You see, she just had a baby.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.894
Are we talking apples or melons?

24:07.989 --> 24:09.604
Mangoes.

24:09.741 --> 24:12.448
You lookin’ at her fruit?
I am a doctor.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.196
Just accept the help.

24:14.287 --> 24:17.529
No, no, ma’am. Ma’am.
I don’t need that many.
I’m just looking for one thing.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.661
Actually, one small little thing.
Not too small.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.294
One thing?
Yeah.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.289
For the woman
who just had your baby?

24:24.422 --> 24:26.629
What?
Come on.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.709
If you want
this relationship to last,
you’d better let me help you.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.135
You pulled me away
from examining the bones...

24:33.222 --> 24:35.213
to play with the biggest
hair ball on earth?

24:35.308 --> 24:38.721
It’s one paper, Mr. Vaziri,
not the Nobel Prize.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.268
Did Hodgins tell you?
Angela.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.347
Emilio in the parking garage.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.853
And since Booth thinks
the victim’s hair may be in here,

24:45.943 --> 24:50.061
we are on tweezing duty until
we separate and ID. every follicle.

24:50.156 --> 24:54.445
- [ Device Beeps ]
- Thank you, mid-17th-century
immigrants.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.992
What are those things?
Wool carders.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.447
I got them from
the Colonial New England
diorama.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.328
Now, if these honeys
can separate wool,

25:03.419 --> 25:06.911
then human hair—
human hair should be
a piece of cake.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.622
Beats tweezing.
Carder up, Mr. Vaziri.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.187
Hey, I figure
if we grab a snack now,

25:32.281 --> 25:34.021
we can dish for about
eight minutes,

25:34.117 --> 25:36.199
and then we can pump
later on.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.160
It’s a glamorous life
we lead, isn’t it?
I’m working.

25:39.247 --> 25:41.158
I know. I’m interrupting.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.285
I got you a grilled-veggie pita,
by the way,

25:43.376 --> 25:45.492
because I know
you’re a wild woman.

25:45.586 --> 25:49.579
I’ve noticed some damage
and scarring that didn’t
show up on the Angelatron.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.210
Oh, really?

25:51.300 --> 25:54.463
Arastoo is gonna be bummed.
He thought he was on a roll.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.715
More importantly,

25:56.806 --> 26:00.845
I got us a reservation
at The Four Winds Spa.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.221
I know. I know.
You’re welcome.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.554
Facials, body scrubs, massages.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.889
Fracturing.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.270
I’m gonna take a pass
on the fracturing.

26:10.361 --> 26:11.862
Are you in?

26:11.946 --> 26:13.937
Itsounds
appealingly indulgent.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.490
There’s an injury
to the victim’s back.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.159
The L4 and L5 show
hairline fracturing.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.952
And there’s no remodeling.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.121
These injuries occurred
at time of death.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.459
Oh.

26:25.543 --> 26:28.706
Dr. Brennan?
I found something
you need to see.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.956
You can see
a dark line of demarcation
near the cut end.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.665
That’s a result
of putrefaction.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.252
Which means the hair
was cut off a corpse.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.758
Is this
Santiago Valmont’s hair?

26:39.849 --> 26:43.433
No. The hair shaft
has a circular cross section
and a thick cuticle.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.100
It didn’t come from a Caucasian.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.019
So, where’s the victim’s hair?

26:47.106 --> 26:48.767
We haven’t found
a match for him yet,

26:48.858 --> 26:51.941
but we have found hair
from 25 different people
in the hair bundle.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.986
- All dead at the time
the hair was removed.
- Twenty-five victims?

26:55.072 --> 26:58.030
Perhaps Dr. Sweets
was right about this being
a ritualistic killing.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.574
Well, if he was hog-tied
in some kind of ceremony,

27:00.661 --> 27:03.869
that would account for
the injuries I found
in the victim’s L4 and L5.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.821
Those didn’t show up
on the Angelatron.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.532
No, they didn’t, Mr. Vaziri.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.619
Sometimes it is best not
to let a machine do your work.

27:10.713 --> 27:14.297
Please reexamine the bones
to see what else you missed
in your quest for notoriety.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.214
Of course.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.020
I’m Tess Levinson.
I’m representing Mr. Sangani.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.813
Of course you are.
First day on the job, right?

27:31.901 --> 27:33.766
Nope. This is my second week.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.852
And l have advised my client of his rights.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.483
Great. Okay.
You can sit.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.438
Without stepping
on your rights, Poorab,

27:39.534 --> 27:41.695
maybe you can tell me why
you ran off with a bag...

27:41.786 --> 27:44.653
that contained hair
from over 25 corpses?

27:44.747 --> 27:46.703
What?
Yeah. According
to our lab,

27:46.791 --> 27:49.703
your client here killed and scalped
over 25 people for their hair.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.330
That’s just sick.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.082
No, man, no, no.
That is whack, man.
I didn’t kill anyone, man.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.831
| hustled the hair
from my uncle’s mortuary.
What?

27:56.926 --> 27:59.292
Look, every Wednesday,
I sneak in there,

27:59.387 --> 28:02.254
I cut the hair off the stiffs
before they stick them
in the furnace.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.135
I sell them to beauty shops
for extensions.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.716
Wait a second. Extensions?

28:06.811 --> 28:09.302
But the customers didn’t know
it came from dead people.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.888
Santiago Valmont came to you
to pick up hair?

28:11.983 --> 28:14.065
That’s all! l was his supplier.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.109
All right, him and his boy
at the salon— um, Kevin.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.313
- Kevin.
- Yeah. Chicks pay big bucks
for weaves of that stuff.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.569
You got one, right?
I bet it’s one of mine.

28:22.660 --> 28:25.572
I can’t do this!
You’re— You’re an animal.

28:25.663 --> 28:27.324
I hate law!

28:27.415 --> 28:29.406
l’m— I’m going
to shave my head.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.286
You forgot your, uh—

28:32.837 --> 28:34.623
Right. So you supplied Kevin too?

28:35.673 --> 28:38.506
I’d like to wait
till I get another lawyer.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.458
You-You understand?

28:48.978 --> 28:51.936
Okay. We’ve got an hour
before the sitter takes off,

28:52.023 --> 28:54.514
so if we leave right now,
we can go crazy...

28:54.609 --> 28:57.396
and treat ourselves with
a trip to the dry cleaners.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.226
Mmm. As exciting as that sounds,

28:59.322 --> 29:01.859
I can’t go anywhere
until I figure out
what this blue stuff is.

29:01.991 --> 29:05.529
This stuff is incredibly acidic.
Not to mention boring.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.656
Come on, honey.
Let’s go.

29:07.747 --> 29:12.366
If we leave right now,
we can fool around in the car
before we get home.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.078
- Sounds good, right?
- Mmm. Actually,
that does sound fun.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.248
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.
Yeah?

29:17.340 --> 29:20.628
Oh, my God! That— That’s it.

29:20.718 --> 29:23.425
This is an extremely
flammable poison...

29:23.512 --> 29:25.548
that contains both sodium silicate
and glycolic acid,

29:25.640 --> 29:27.756
which is basically
degraded ethylene glycol.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.306
It’s antifreeze!

29:29.435 --> 29:31.767
He was doused
in antifreeze?
Yes!

29:31.854 --> 29:33.810
That is it.

29:33.898 --> 29:37.015
I did it, Ange.
I figured it out.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.442
Now I’m really feeling like
foolin’ around in that car.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.942
Here.
Okay.

29:48.037 --> 29:51.154
Oh, it is not a good time
unless you know your way around
a Brazilian Blowout.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.284
We are seriously
understaffed right now.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.708
I’m sure Booth could help.
His father was a barber.

29:55.795 --> 29:59.788
Right. If she doesn’t learn
how to properly layer, you’re
gonna lose a lot of business.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.291
- Where’s Kevin?
- I don’t know.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.843
He disappeared,
and he took everything with him.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.136
His station was cleaned out.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.259
For five years
he’s been working here,

30:09.350 --> 30:12.262
and then he takes off
without even a phone call.

30:13.771 --> 30:16.433
Wait. You guys don’t think that—

30:17.400 --> 30:18.856
- Oh.
- Oh.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.353
Oh.

30:26.742 --> 30:30.860
Mr. Vaziri, have you found
anything yet that might point
to a cause of death?

30:33.082 --> 30:34.947
Excuse me?
Cause of death.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.657
That’s the reason we’re here.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.663
Yes, I know. I’m sorry.
I got distracted.

30:38.754 --> 30:43.043
Uh, I noted various scrapes
and anomalies, but none seem
to be related to his murder.

30:43.134 --> 30:45.375
Why are you distracted?
Do I need to get
another intern?

30:45.469 --> 30:47.551
No. No. It’s just—

30:47.638 --> 30:50.926
I got word that the journal
isn’t going to publish my paper.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.723
Is that all?

30:52.810 --> 30:57.224
It got pulled in favor of
a puff piece about Selena Gomez
on a fossil hunt.

30:57.314 --> 31:01.182
I’m not familiar with
Dr. Gomez’s work, but I look
fonNard to reading about it.

31:01.277 --> 31:03.689
I worked on that paper
for six months.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.270
- It was excellent.
- Yes, I know.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.451
They sent it to me for review.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.992
You aren’t supposed to know
who’s on the review board,

31:12.079 --> 31:13.990
but since they’re not
publishing it.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.787
You thought it was excellent?

31:15.875 --> 31:18.958
Yes, although I haven’t reviewed
Dr. Gomez’s findings.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.161
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.873
You’re welcome.
However, I am quite pleased
you won’t be published.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.832
I-I don’t understand.

31:26.927 --> 31:31.216
You are clearly
too immature to understand
what being published means.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.468
I know many scientists
who were published...

31:33.559 --> 31:37.051
who are useless and forgotten today...

31:37.146 --> 31:39.478

what they do wasn’t as important...

[ Sweets ]
You worked at that salon
for five years...

32:09.136 --> 32:11.343
and you just walked out
without a word to anybody?

32:11.430 --> 32:15.264
You think l was the only one
that hated Santiago?

32:15.351 --> 32:19.094
Talk to the other stylists,
to his shampoo boy, to Tabitha.

32:19.188 --> 32:23.101
For God’s sake,
the man was a prima donna
with no talent.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.558
Besides,
I was busier than he was,

32:25.653 --> 32:27.985
so why would I have
to kill him for his chair?

32:28.072 --> 32:30.939
Maybe, but you
may have killed him because
you were his drug dealer.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.024
- No comment.
- No comment. Great.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.280
Our team already
checked your apartment.
We found your stash.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.989
Third ceiling tile from
the Kathy Griffin poster,
in case you don’t believe us.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.667
It’s only a matter of time
till we match them to the drugs
found in Santiago’s system.

32:42.753 --> 32:48.043
Okay. So, I may have
sold Santiago a few
recreational aids. Big deal.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.295
We know that he owed you
a thousand dollars.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.172
You got mad
because he didn’t pay.

32:52.263 --> 32:55.596
[ Chuckles ]
You really think that I would
get myself dirty with his blood?

32:55.683 --> 32:59.096
- Do you see what I wear?
- Why were you heading for
the airport then, Kevin?

32:59.186 --> 33:01.472
Last time I checked,
dealing drugs was illegal.

33:01.564 --> 33:03.145
- True. Very, very true.
- Yeah.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.518
That’s a shame, though,
that your car did overheat.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.645
Yeah. And you know
what’s weird about that?

33:07.736 --> 33:09.601
According to your
credit card records,

33:09.697 --> 33:12.109
you bought two gallons
of antifreeze just last week,

33:12.199 --> 33:14.406
but we didn’t find any
in your car, so—

33:15.077 --> 33:16.317
So?

33:16.412 --> 33:18.994
So, Santiago’s killer
doused him with antifreeze...

33:19.081 --> 33:21.413
and tried to light him
on fire.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.537
Oh, God.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.337
Well, I mean—

33:28.424 --> 33:31.086
Well, somebody must have
stolen it from my trunk.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.792
I mean, there’s
no other explanation.

33:32.887 --> 33:35.094

think of a few more.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.221

Mr. Vaziri alone.

33:45.316 --> 33:47.307
He hasn’t been doing
his best work lately.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.767
Oh, he’ll be fine.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.604
Besides, I had to kill people
to get a reservation here.

[ Sighs ]
I found a superficial incision
at the inferior margin...

35:02.017 --> 35:04.633
on the anterior aspect
of the body of the hyoid.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.854
Where exactly on the hyoid,
Mr. Vaziri?

35:08.941 --> 35:12.308
Two millimeters superior
to the attachment
of the sterno-hyoid.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.605
Are you sure?
It was too small
for the Medio Cam,

35:14.697 --> 35:16.608
but I felt it, just as you said.

35:16.699 --> 35:20.283
The damage was from a blade.
I’m working with Dr. Hodgins
to determine what kind.

35:20.369 --> 35:24.533
How could someone slice
the underside of the hyoid
during a struggle?

Sweetie, get off the phone
and join me in heaven.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.202

- You were right.
This was an excellent idea.

Hey, I paid my money,
so take me to heaven.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.568
There’s only one way
for the hyoid to be sliced like that.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.321
All right, Bones.
You could’ve changed,
gotten the mask off your face.

36:03.412 --> 36:06.119
Well, I’m finally comfortable.
Are you still dissatisfied
with the way I look?

Huh? Me? Why is this
all of a sudden
about me here?

36:08.959 --> 36:11.541
Kevin was going to
cut Santiago’s hair.
Right.

36:11.628 --> 36:16.167
So he had him sit
in the shampoo chair
with his head all the way back.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.591
That way, a cut
across the throat would
have nicked the hyoid...

36:19.678 --> 36:21.885
and sliced the external
carotid artery.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.881
We should find evidence
of blood.
Mm-mmm.

36:24.975 --> 36:27.512
You’re not— You’re not
gonna find the blood there
’cause Kevin didn’t do it.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.844
But Kevin had motive,
the antifreeze.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.599
He ran. And forensically—

36:31.690 --> 36:33.601
Bones, just trust
the barber’s son, okay?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.683
Santiago, he hated Kevin.
Plus he was vain.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.609
He would never allow him
to work on his hair.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.688

who he would trust, okay?

the extensions that Santiago’s
famous for, right?

- But you’re the one
who styled them.

technique right now on her.

positioned in the sink,

37:31.458 --> 37:34.245

spurted this high.
