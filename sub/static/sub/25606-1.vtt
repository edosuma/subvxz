No, no, it's a pretty good place except for
the drains, they keep clogging.

07:22.473 --> 07:27.891
Yeah. Of course I told the landlord.
He says it's never happened before, says

07:28.133 --> 07:32.816
it's my fault somehow.
I guess it's my hair, but what am I supposed

07:33.058 --> 07:35.120
to do, just shave it off?

Eh, I've felt better.

09:19.240 --> 09:25.960
Oh Lorna, not you too?
I guess this bug’s really getting around.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.400
No, no, absolutely not.

09:31.960 --> 09:36.175
You should know better than anyone that
I’ve never even taken a single pill

09:36.416 --> 09:38.200
or a single drop of medicine.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.166
Those pharmaceutical companies
don’t care about you.

09:44.408 --> 09:49.000
They just want to make easy money by selling
poison the public.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.360
[coughs]

09:52.600 --> 09:55.160
I'll be fine if I can just get some sleep.

13:41.480 --> 13:46.281
In other breaking news... The FDA has
announced a nationwide recall of the cold

13:46.523 --> 13:51.453
and flu medicine Flemucosol, after the drug
has been linked to a number of deaths

13:51.693 --> 13:55.000
nationwide. The FDA strongly
urges that if you have this

13:55.240 --> 13:59.400
drug in your home to discontinue
its use immediately.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.360
It is believed that a large quantity of the
drug, in its liquid form, has been

14:03.633 --> 14:08.371
contaminated at the manufacturing facility.
The contaminant and the source are

14:08.613 --> 14:10.280

I’m telling you, this is
gonna be my masterpiece.

15:42.021 --> 15:45.553
Are you listening?
Today we’re shooting the party scene.

15:46.360 --> 15:51.120
Where Marcello rides that girl... you know?
They’re celebrating the divorce of some

15:51.360 --> 15:55.640
woman, and he says to her
"It’s like you’re a virgin again".

15:55.880 --> 15:56.960
Why does he say that?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.720
’Fuck do I know? It's something the
character says that in the movie.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.800
Wait: you’ve seen the movie, right?

16:05.080 --> 16:06.280
La Dolce Vita?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.840
Yeah.
I just don’t like the line.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.880
Why would you want to be fuckin virgin man?
Huh? Being a virgin fuckin sucks ass.

16:12.148 --> 16:13.600
I don’t fucking get it.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.670
It's symbolism or some shit,
I don’t know!

16:15.910 --> 16:18.280
We’re doing porn, don’t ask
too many questions.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.800
I have a ton of ideas.
For the fountain of Trevi scene I want the

16:23.040 --> 16:27.720
girl to yell "Marcello!
Cum here!" pointing at her tits.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.800
You know?
Like "c-u-m".

16:31.040 --> 16:33.760
Like orgasm.
And the final scene...

16:34.000 --> 16:37.800
When the girl is waving at Marcello in the
distance, on the beach...

16:41.240 --> 16:43.080
She goes like this...

16:46.200 --> 16:48.840
Back to business:
I’ve got a surprise for you...

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
Irina!

16:51.755 --> 16:53.840
Irina!
Come here!

17:02.240 --> 17:09.400
Salvatore, meet your partner for today.
The beautiful and innocent Irina.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
I’ll leave you alone.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.520
Hi.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.520
I'm Irina.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.160
I'm gonna do the scene with you.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.913
I am... a big fan of...
You. Your movies.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.079
And your cock.
And your eyes.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.160
You’re not so innocent then.

17:29.480 --> 17:34.098
I just saw a lot of movies...
I wanted to talk to you before the scene

17:34.340 --> 17:37.153
because...
I’m not sure about some things...

17:37.395 --> 17:39.480
I’ve never done this before.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.600
Sorry this is your first porno?
I’m so honored baby.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.400
Don’t worry cause every girl I’ve worked
with said I was the best partner.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.720
Actually...

17:51.040 --> 17:55.480
Actually, this is my first...
my first time. Ever.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.000
I don’t understand.

17:57.240 --> 18:04.155
I just never found the right guy...
and then a couple of years ago

18:04.396 --> 18:07.000
I saw you in a movie...

18:08.080 --> 18:11.960
and I thought: I want that.

18:13.200 --> 18:19.200
You were so handsome, so confident...
and your body was... just... perfect.

18:19.480 --> 18:23.120
So I figured: why not just wait?

18:24.760 --> 18:28.720
I’ll keep my virginity until
I have chance to meet him!

18:29.600 --> 18:34.685
I wrote an email to Bogdan:
I knew he was your director

18:34.926 --> 18:42.000
because I looked up the credits
of 8 1/2 inches, Doggystyle Afternoon...

18:42.560 --> 18:44.680
you must think I’m a giant nerd!

18:44.920 --> 18:45.680
No

18:46.200 --> 18:48.920
I’m just trying to tell you...
I’m kind of in love with y...

18:49.160 --> 18:51.800
Ok, ok, thank you.
I need some to concentrate.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.880
Leave please.
Leave!

18:58.600 --> 19:01.560
Jesus! Jesus. I need to talk to you.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.280
What?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.360
I can’t do the next scene.
I need you to fuck Irina.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.920
The new girl? Why?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.000
Come up here!

19:12.480 --> 19:13.640
I can't!

19:14.800 --> 19:16.360
I can't either!

19:16.720 --> 19:18.360
I just finished my scene.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.525
Bogdan made me do the money shot
four fucking times because

19:22.766 --> 19:24.520
he didn’t like the lighting.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.320
I'm empty.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.161
Man, I really can't, ok?
She scares the shit out of me.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.200
She’s a fucking virgin!
I can't please!

19:35.360 --> 19:40.720
Listen. I really don’t know what
you’re talking about.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.160
But if you don’t do the scene
we don’t get paid.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.920
We’ve got to pay the rent.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.840
Just man the fuck up.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.200
And fuck the virgin.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.640
You look good, man.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.200
Irina, for this scene I need on all fours.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.840
Sal, I want you to climb on top of her...

20:42.080 --> 20:42.920
Come, Marcello...

20:43.160 --> 20:45.000
...and say: "Have you ever been with a man?"

20:45.960 --> 20:47.320
And then, you know...

20:47.760 --> 20:49.760
whip out your dick and fuck her.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.280
Come on!

20:51.640 --> 20:52.600
We don't have all day!

20:53.720 --> 20:54.880
Come on, chop chop!

20:59.160 --> 21:00.040
Action!

21:16.920 --> 21:18.440

21:18.920 --> 21:20.400
Have you ever been with a man?

21:20.640 --> 21:21.320
Good boy

21:21.560 --> 21:22.920
Just fuckin do it.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.640
Fuck the virgin, we've got
to pay the rent...

21:29.400 --> 21:30.240
Are you awake?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.280
Sal! What the fuck?

21:32.680 --> 21:34.320
Alright, just... try and spank her.

I need a gas station

39:27.240 --> 39:32.800
Um, "Last Chance Gas" was
10 miles back, in Russellville.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.000
10 miles?

39:34.240 --> 39:36.080
Oh, no

39:37.400 --> 39:39.400
I'm not sure I can make it that far.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.800
I can take you.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.240
Oh, you will?

39:48.080 --> 39:49.480
Thank you so much!

40:14.560 --> 40:17.360
Thanks again, I really appreciate it.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.840
I don't know what I would've done.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.760
Was that the highway we just passed?

40:32.720 --> 40:35.080
Russellville's the next turn, it's closer.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.080
[muffled screams]

41:41.160 --> 41:42.920
So what do you want to do with him?

41:43.280 --> 41:50.280
Well, looks like we got ourselves
one of them "terrorists"...

41:50.640 --> 41:53.960
[laughing]

41:58.920 --> 42:00.920
[screams]

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
[piano music]

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
Hi, my name is Adrian.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.600
I am 40 years old.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.680
Money has always been my passion

42:45.800 --> 42:47.160
counting it

42:47.520 --> 42:48.440
investing it

42:48.680 --> 42:49.760
making it

42:50.520 --> 42:52.200
And I'm pretty good at it too.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.960
That's why I moved here.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.240
A very important bank
wanted me to be their broker.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.080
What about you?

43:00.800 --> 43:02.800
Well, my name is Laniakea.

43:03.040 --> 43:03.720
Heh, what?

43:03.960 --> 43:08.160
Yeah, I know that face.
Everybody messes it up. It's Laniakea!

43:09.000 --> 43:09.960
Lanaikea!

43:10.480 --> 43:11.680
Lanaikea?

43:12.320 --> 43:12.800
Good job!

43:13.040 --> 43:14.640
See? Maybe I'm not like all the others.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.400
Maybe you're not...

43:16.640 --> 43:19.360
I'm half hawaiian and my father
used to be a hippy, so...

43:19.720 --> 43:21.760
That's how I ended up with
this funny name I guess.

43:23.240 --> 43:24.160
I like it.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.520
It means "Immeasurable Heaven"

43:31.120 --> 43:31.840
What?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.720
It's a beautiful meaning...

43:36.760 --> 43:38.760
[ringtone]

43:58.000 --> 43:59.520
A beautiful meaning.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.280
You still haven't told me
what it is that you do.

44:03.520 --> 44:04.240
Oh you mean work?

44:04.480 --> 44:07.160
Yeah you know, that thing you
do every day in order to make money

44:07.400 --> 44:08.960
So you really don't know who I am?

44:09.200 --> 44:12.000
You're not one of my 80,000 YouTube fans?

44:12.240 --> 44:13.400
80,000? Wow!

44:13.640 --> 44:16.800
You're not one of those webcam girls who
show off their clothes and make up are you?

44:17.040 --> 44:19.400
Ahaha, do I look like
a fashion blogger to you?

44:20.800 --> 44:23.790
You know what, maybe you should
check out my channel first, and then

44:24.031 --> 44:25.840
decide if you still want to see me...

44:33.480 --> 44:36.120
[acoustic guitar]

44:49.960 --> 44:51.920
Well, that’s it guys.
I hope you liked this song

44:52.200 --> 44:54.640
and don’t forget to subscribe
to my YouTube channel.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.600
[blows kiss]

44:55.840 --> 44:57.160
Many kisses!

45:00.560 --> 45:02.560
[phone ringing]

45:14.920 --> 45:16.480
Goodmorning Earthlings

45:16.720 --> 45:20.800
and welcome to a
new episode with Astroviking!

45:21.120 --> 45:24.868
If you've clicked on this video
for the first time, it might be

45:25.110 --> 45:27.960
because you were wondering what is Laniakea.

45:28.600 --> 45:33.720
Laniakea is our house in the Universe...

45:42.240 --> 45:44.560
Laniakea...

45:44.960 --> 45:46.960
[waves crashing]

45:52.640 --> 45:53.960
Never been here before!

45:54.240 --> 45:55.080
Really?

45:55.720 --> 45:57.720
This is like my favorite place.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.720
It's so special...

46:00.400 --> 46:02.400
What's so special about it?

46:02.640 --> 46:07.280
I don't know. Because it's quiet,
and it's dark...

46:08.600 --> 46:10.280
Come, I want to show you something.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.160
What are you doing?

46:12.400 --> 46:13.800
Just trust me!

46:18.560 --> 46:19.320
What!

46:19.680 --> 46:21.680
Sit down.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.360
You can't see them with all the city lights.

46:35.520 --> 46:38.840
[eerie sounds]

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
God, there are so many!

46:46.960 --> 46:51.240
Laniakea is our house in the Universe.

46:52.280 --> 46:57.550
To be more precise, it is a tiny dot
in a gigantic conglomerate

46:57.791 --> 47:00.680
of 10,000 galaxies amongst which

47:01.400 --> 47:03.680
there is our Milky Way...

47:04.880 --> 47:12.560
Alpha Centauri, the Star closest to
the Earth after the Sun: 4.3 light years...

47:13.120 --> 47:17.080
in the scale of the universe
it is very, very close:

47:17.400 --> 47:20.000
it's as if you were in the kitchen,
and opened the door

47:20.241 --> 47:22.000
and stepped into the living room.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.198
Bad news though:
with today's technologies

47:26.440 --> 47:30.200
it would take us 30,000 years to get there

47:30.480 --> 47:33.480
that's quite a big step
to reach a living room.

47:34.640 --> 47:42.925
4.3 light years is nothing compared to the
size of Laniakea, which measures about

47:43.166 --> 47:45.800
500 million light years.

47:46.240 --> 47:52.680
Which is no more than a tiny dot
in the whole visible Universe.

47:54.120 --> 47:58.480
[moaning]

48:02.120 --> 48:04.120
Stars...

48:09.920 --> 48:11.920
Cosmic microwave background...

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
Gravitational waves...

48:17.960 --> 48:19.280
The Great Void...

48:23.080 --> 48:24.160
Inflation!

48:37.680 --> 48:38.800
What's the matter, baby?

48:41.120 --> 48:44.160
I'm sorry, it's just a little bit
of stress from work...

48:52.800 --> 48:53.840
[phone dings]

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
Good morning Earthlings!

49:02.600 --> 49:04.600
Ready for a new episode?

49:05.640 --> 49:10.330
UY Scuti is a bright red supergiant,
the leading candidate for being

49:10.571 --> 49:12.240
the largest known star

49:13.080 --> 49:15.080
is nothing compared to the size of...

49:15.600 --> 49:18.440
...which measures about
500 billion light years...

49:18.720 --> 49:27.600
[overlapping voice over]

49:27.840 --> 49:31.640
...thus a volume nearly
5 billion times that of the Sun

49:34.320 --> 49:36.600
Where does the light come from?

49:37.600 --> 49:40.120
The Sun, you'll say... sure...

49:40.640 --> 49:45.600
but what you don't know is that photons are
born in the Sun's nucleus and are trapped

49:45.840 --> 49:50.400
there for millions of years until they
manage to reach the surface where they are

49:50.640 --> 49:58.760
propelled for 150,000,000km
and in 10 minutes reach your skin

49:59.640 --> 50:00.760
Photons...

50:02.040 --> 50:04.040
Fucking photons!

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
[laughing]

50:21.400 --> 50:22.560
[glass shatters]

50:24.560 --> 50:28.160
Oh no... gravity!

50:32.160 --> 50:33.040
[phone dings]

50:41.280 --> 50:45.880
Imagine the Earth and compare it to the
Universe ... then zoom in on a city

50:46.120 --> 50:54.720
like New York: that's Laniakea. Zoom in
further on a skyscraper: that's our galaxy.

50:55.040 --> 51:00.400
Now go inside one of the rooms:
that's our solar system

51:00.640 --> 51:09.640
and, floating mid-air, a single
speck of dust: behold, the Earth.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.040
How did it start?

51:22.600 --> 51:24.000
[knocking]

51:26.440 --> 51:27.680
Adrian!

51:28.440 --> 51:29.960
Go home! I don't want to see anybody!

51:30.200 --> 51:32.640
Adrian! Open the door!

51:32.880 --> 51:34.840
Go away! I don't want to see you!

51:35.080 --> 51:36.760
Fuck you! Let me in!

51:39.000 --> 51:40.760
Adrian! Open the door!

51:41.000 --> 51:42.880
Please, please stop shouting!
Go away!

51:43.360 --> 51:46.000
Open this fucking door, now!

51:49.640 --> 51:51.280
Please, stay away, stay away from me.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.000
It's been two weeks, you haven't
answered any of my calls. I'm coming inside!

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
What the fuck happened here?

51:59.960 --> 52:01.960
It's OK, can you just leave?

52:02.200 --> 52:04.440
Adrian, did someone break inside your house?

52:04.680 --> 52:06.840
No, it's fine, it's fine.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.360
What the fuck...

52:10.160 --> 52:11.760
No. No no no!

52:12.160 --> 52:13.280
Don't touch it!

52:13.840 --> 52:15.840
This is really freaky...

52:16.080 --> 52:18.000
What the fuck happened here?

52:18.320 --> 52:20.320
What is all this stuff doing on the floor?

52:20.560 --> 52:22.600
It's OK... it's fine.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.920
Adrian, what the fuck is going on?

52:25.720 --> 52:26.920
Adrian, give me some-

52:30.000 --> 52:34.360
Oh god... your name...
I don't want to think about it.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.040
Adrian, drop that!

52:38.880 --> 52:39.600
Please!

52:41.000 --> 52:43.560
Fuck, we spend our entire
life counting money...

52:44.200 --> 52:46.840
when we're just a single
heartbeat of life...

52:48.040 --> 52:52.360
We are nothing! As Astroviking says!

52:53.800 --> 52:55.800
Who the fuck is Astroviking?

52:56.840 --> 52:58.840
You don't understand...

53:03.720 --> 53:08.240
Stars, milions and milions of
times bigger than the Sun...

53:08.880 --> 53:13.000
black holes, nebulas, voids superclusters...

53:14.720 --> 53:16.720
I can see the greatness!

53:20.000 --> 53:20.880
[phone dings]

53:29.000 --> 53:31.880
Good morning Earthlings!

53:33.400 --> 53:34.600
Who the fuck is he?

53:34.840 --> 53:38.560
Today I'd like to talk about
something quite peculiar.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.440
You might have some
trouble sleeping tonight.

53:42.040 --> 53:42.960
What is he saying?

53:43.200 --> 53:46.000
We are all made of stars!

53:46.640 --> 53:48.640
- Who is he?
- Silence!

53:50.800 --> 53:54.325
The substance we are made of
comes directly from the heart

53:54.566 --> 53:57.360
of stars exploded billions of years ago...

53:58.320 --> 54:02.920
so we can say we are all sons of stars!

54:04.760 --> 54:06.680
[laughs]

54:07.120 --> 54:08.120
Adrian?

54:08.680 --> 54:09.440
[stabs]

54:18.200 --> 54:20.200
But have no fear earthlings!

54:20.960 --> 54:28.880
Your atoms will outlive you and
maybe, one day, be part of a new Star.

54:29.440 --> 54:33.600
[laughs]

55:06.920 --> 55:08.920
[ticking]

55:26.400 --> 55:28.400

56:24.080 --> 56:26.080

57:03.760 --> 57:05.760
[ticking]

57:28.720 --> 57:30.720
[alarm]

57:39.200 --> 57:40.800
You don't want to do that to me.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.160
Didn't they teach you to hold life sacred?

57:43.400 --> 57:44.760
Doesn't my life count?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.200
You can't do this. Look me in the eyes.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.600
Look at me.
You don't know how they caught me.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.360
You don't know how they killed me!

57:51.600 --> 57:54.160
I suffered the agony of terror and death.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.640
Do I deserve this?

57:55.880 --> 57:57.480
Was I an evil predator? No.

57:57.720 --> 58:00.080
Just a travel buddy.
We're all travel buddies.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.560
How can you be an accomplice
to what they did to me?

58:02.800 --> 58:05.400
Of those who deny universal brotherhood?

58:05.640 --> 58:09.000
You trample on freedom.
You hold life in contempt too!

58:09.400 --> 58:11.120
You deny your own guilt!

58:11.360 --> 58:15.280
If you don't hold life sacred, you don't
deserve it. Got it?

58:15.800 --> 58:20.440
Know what you should do?
Look me in the eye.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.840
Come on. Do it.

58:23.320 --> 58:24.400
Do it!

58:24.680 --> 58:26.000
Do it!

58:26.280 --> 58:29.640
Do it! Do it! Do it!

58:29.920 --> 58:36.760
Do it! Do it! Do it!

59:24.920 --> 59:26.920
[dramatic music]

59:34.320 --> 59:36.320

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840
[screaming]

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.040
Do you need help getting more followers?

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.040
Is your face past it’s sell-by date?

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.840
Introducing “Psy-Swap”.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.960
Your memories, feelings, soul,
in a brand new package.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.120
Get the body you deserve.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.200
The only limit is your imagination.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.880
Call now.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.480

[coughing]

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.280
I told you you were too old for this.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.400
[sci-fi sounds]

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.920
Are there no budget options?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.280
We can't all just drop
a few thousand like that.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.920
I'm not getting work with this face.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.480
DO you not understand? My work
is my face, and I'm rotting.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.240
How many models do you know
that look like me nowadays?

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.480
I’ll be thirty in a year, and then
I can wave my chances goodbye.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.560
Then I’ll be too old to even make the swap.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.160
[beep]

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560
[background chatter]

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800
I only put one sugar in there.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.160
Put another one in there if you want

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400
No, one's enough thanks.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.320
I don't think I've ever seen
you drink so many calories.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.840
So who’d have thought we’d be here?
After all these years?

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.320
Not me.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.200
I’d have thought you’d have
been in New York by now. Or Milan.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.240
You were crushing it mate...

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.400
So, I hear you’re looking for a swap.
