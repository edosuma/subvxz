Covert Affairs...

00:02.863 --> 00:04.878
The D.C.I.'s asked me
to start a file on you,

00:07.033 --> 00:09.468
Helen's been our cutout,
passing messages between us.

00:09.502 --> 00:11.422
I pulled her in more fully
into Henry's situation

00:11.471 --> 00:12.754
about a week ago.

00:12.805 --> 00:14.590
Director Campbell,
it's an honor to have you.

00:14.641 --> 00:16.058
I'm actually not a director
anymore.

00:16.091 --> 00:17.092
Is one of you guys Reese?

00:17.093 --> 00:18.227
I'm just next door.

00:18.261 --> 00:19.311
I collect the rent,

00:19.345 --> 00:21.013
fix broken toilets
for the landlords,

00:21.047 --> 00:22.014
so he gives me a break.

00:22.048 --> 00:23.315
I'm Sana.

00:23.349 --> 00:24.650
I lost my son, Jai.

00:24.684 --> 00:26.568
Jai was my friend.
I lost him too.

00:26.603 --> 00:29.571
And I think you are smart enough
to help me take Henry down.

00:29.606 --> 00:30.722
Ah, Andrew Goodman.

00:30.740 --> 00:33.391
Bienvenue.
Welcome.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.561
Henry ordered that helicopter
shot down,

00:36.579 --> 00:38.299
and you were the one
that fired the missile.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.665
That's not even a question.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.668
What are you planning on doing
to David Dupres?

00:42.702 --> 00:43.869
Tell her.

00:43.903 --> 00:45.087
Tell her what he's gonna do
to David!

00:45.121 --> 00:46.588
Sana!

00:47.957 --> 00:48.924
Oh!

01:25.745 --> 01:28.714
Why are we stopping here?

01:28.748 --> 01:30.215
I could use a drink.

01:30.249 --> 01:31.917
You?

01:54.440 --> 01:55.741
Can I have a shot of Patron?

01:55.775 --> 01:56.808
What do you want?

01:56.826 --> 01:58.360
Nothing.
I don't want a drink.

01:58.411 --> 02:00.162
Make it two, and can you
charge it to the room?

02:00.196 --> 02:02.197
It's under the name Goodman.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.334
You want to know
what we're doing here?

02:07.704 --> 02:09.503
Henry's been texting Andrew
every half hour

02:09.538 --> 02:11.089
asking for a progress report.

02:11.124 --> 02:12.207
So?

02:12.258 --> 02:13.709
So this
is Andrew Goodman's hotel.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.043
It's the best place
to figure out

02:15.094 --> 02:17.713
how to answer those texts.

02:17.764 --> 02:20.215
What about the dead body
we left in your apartment?

02:20.266 --> 02:22.551
Somebody will have heard
the gunshots.

02:22.602 --> 02:23.769
They're going to find the body.

02:23.803 --> 02:24.936
It's only a matter of when.

02:24.971 --> 02:26.691
That means the police
are gonna be after us,

02:26.723 --> 02:28.603
if they're not already,
as soon as they I.D. it.

02:33.563 --> 02:36.031
It's hard to I.D. a body
with no I.D.

02:36.065 --> 02:38.033
I doubt his name
was even Goodman.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.868
He's a professional ghost.

02:39.902 --> 02:42.204
I'm counting on the fact
that he was good at his job.

02:42.238 --> 02:44.373
Andrew Goodman
will be a John Doe

02:44.407 --> 02:47.459
at least for a little while.

02:47.493 --> 02:49.044
Hopefully, that'll give us
enough time.

02:49.078 --> 02:50.195
Enough time for what?

02:50.213 --> 02:53.665
Counterstrike.

02:53.699 --> 02:55.667
Henry doesn't know
his guy is dead,

02:55.701 --> 02:57.836
so maybe for
the first time ever,

02:57.870 --> 03:00.205
I know something he doesn't.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.342
Drink up.

03:04.377 --> 03:07.062
We're gonna go see what
Andrew Goodman left behind.

03:07.096 --> 03:09.097
Room 425.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.625
You really have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

03:40.913 --> 03:42.881
You stormed
into my interrogation

03:42.915 --> 03:44.549
because you were so desperate
to find out

03:44.583 --> 03:47.219
what Andrew was planning
for David.

03:47.253 --> 03:49.054
Well, Andrew is dead.

03:49.088 --> 03:51.223
The answers are here.

03:51.257 --> 03:52.924
They have to be.

04:23.389 --> 04:24.840
Turn on the TV loud.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.558
Where are you going?

04:37.770 --> 04:39.404
Louder.

04:39.438 --> 04:40.972
Louder.

04:57.656 --> 04:59.207
Turn it off.

05:23.199 --> 05:24.950
Bingo.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.999
I need to decrypt
this password

05:41.033 --> 05:42.667
and find a safe place
to read the drive,

05:42.701 --> 05:44.002
and that's gonna take time--

05:44.036 --> 05:45.503
time that you don't have
right now.

05:45.537 --> 05:47.172
'Cause David's wondering
where I am.

05:47.206 --> 05:48.673
Go home and put him at ease.

05:48.707 --> 05:49.874
Lie to him?

05:49.892 --> 05:52.210
Go through the story again.

05:52.228 --> 05:53.378
I need to hear you say it.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.380
I have lied before.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.714
Say it again.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.716
Go.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.551
When you followed Andrew
out of the meeting,

06:00.570 --> 06:02.220
you were distraught
you'd blown the deal.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.388
We grabbed a drink at a hotel.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.390
I calmed you down,
which took longer

06:05.408 --> 06:06.858
than either of us expected.

06:06.892 --> 06:10.362
You'll be back into work
in the morning, pride bruised,

06:10.396 --> 06:12.030
ready to make it up to David.

06:12.064 --> 06:14.699
Good.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.234
Go home
and try to get some sleep.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.736
Sleep isn't on the cards.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.873
We tortured a man.

06:21.907 --> 06:23.208
You shot him.

06:23.242 --> 06:24.575
He's dead.

06:24.594 --> 06:26.344
It doesn't affect you?

06:30.549 --> 06:33.268
I don't have time.

06:33.302 --> 06:34.436
We don't have time.

06:34.470 --> 06:35.753
You want to protect David?

06:35.771 --> 06:38.690
We have to move fast,
and I need you to trust me.

06:38.724 --> 06:40.525
Trust you?

06:40.559 --> 06:43.028
You think a tough exterior
is going to cover the fact

06:43.062 --> 06:47.616
that you have no idea
how to handle Henry?

06:47.650 --> 06:49.451
I was married to him
for 11 years

06:49.485 --> 06:53.288
and his asset before that.

06:53.322 --> 06:55.073
He's better at this than you.

06:55.107 --> 06:56.941
Go home, Sana.

Your man
still sleeping it off?

07:32.395 --> 07:34.896
No.
Not exactly.

07:37.117 --> 07:39.451
Can I--can we talk?

07:41.788 --> 07:43.455
Just a second.

07:52.766 --> 07:54.583
He's dead.

07:54.601 --> 07:55.751
Dead?

07:55.769 --> 07:57.085
We got in a fight.
It got rough.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.254
I had to defend myself.

07:59.272 --> 08:01.590
Sounds like it serves
the asshole right.

08:01.608 --> 08:03.592
This'll calm you down.

08:03.610 --> 08:04.760
No, thanks.
I can't.

08:04.778 --> 08:06.428
I have to figure out
what to do.

08:06.446 --> 08:07.763
I'm in some serious shit,

08:07.781 --> 08:10.766
and I don't have anyone
who's gonna help me.

08:10.784 --> 08:12.434
You've been through this before,
right?

08:12.452 --> 08:14.436
You said your stepdad
hit your mom?

08:14.454 --> 08:18.106
Yeah, yeah,
and I hated the prick for it,

08:18.124 --> 08:20.292
but I've never killed him.

08:22.629 --> 08:23.945
I'm sorry.

08:23.964 --> 08:25.614
I shouldn't--I shouldn't have
thought--

08:25.632 --> 08:28.300
Wait, wait.
What do you need?

08:28.335 --> 08:30.469
Pretend like you don't know
where I am,

08:30.503 --> 08:32.304
like, I haven't been here
for days.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.472
You don't know where I went.

08:33.506 --> 08:35.474
Like, you have no idea
who this guy is.

08:35.508 --> 08:37.342
Buy me some time.

08:40.630 --> 08:42.264
This is the building manager.

08:42.298 --> 08:43.799
Please, Reese.

08:47.470 --> 08:48.970
Yeah?

08:50.640 --> 08:53.442
Wait, what?

08:53.476 --> 08:54.610
Okay, okay.

08:54.644 --> 08:56.645
I'll run over.
I'll see you soon.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.916
They found the body.

09:04.004 --> 09:06.005
What are you gonna tell 'em?

09:09.259 --> 09:10.376
You weren't there.

09:10.427 --> 09:11.710
You left days ago,
and I don't know

09:11.761 --> 09:14.263
where to find you,
all right?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.069
Who is it?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.121
It's me.

09:45.628 --> 09:46.745
What do you want, Helen?

09:46.796 --> 09:48.247
I have to be careful
where I'm seen.

09:48.298 --> 09:52.084
Can I please come in?

09:52.135 --> 09:53.719
It was your decision
to become a ghost.

09:53.753 --> 09:55.421
Don't expect me to help you
keep up that lie.

09:55.472 --> 09:56.922
I don't.

09:56.973 --> 09:58.874
The Campbells have asked for
my help with Arthur's defense.

09:58.892 --> 10:00.876
Oh, you're a lawyer now?

10:00.894 --> 10:03.044
I know you must be
in a lot of pain,

10:03.063 --> 10:07.349
and I am deeply sorry
about Annie,

10:07.383 --> 10:09.384
but I need to know everything
that happened between

10:09.402 --> 10:10.886
her and Henry in Copenhagen

10:10.904 --> 10:13.065
if I'm gonna find any evidence
to tie him to the attack

10:13.073 --> 10:14.389
and exonerate Arthur.

10:14.407 --> 10:17.025
Okay, you and I don't talk
about Annie ever.

10:17.059 --> 10:18.243
Understand?

10:18.278 --> 10:19.912
I understand what you must
be going through.

10:19.946 --> 10:21.229
Bullshit.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.564
I think you're here
because Annie's gone.

10:22.582 --> 10:23.899
Did Arthur and Joan
even ask for your help,

10:23.917 --> 10:25.084
or did you offer it

10:25.118 --> 10:26.902
trying to clean your slate
across the board?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.087
You're right.

10:28.121 --> 10:29.755
I have so much to make up for.

10:29.789 --> 10:31.457
It's too late.

10:33.242 --> 10:35.094
I don't ever expect you
to forgive me,

10:35.128 --> 10:37.429
but I need you to know
I never stopped being your wife,

10:37.464 --> 10:39.765
not for one moment
in seven years,

10:39.799 --> 10:41.600
and the longer it went on,
the more I realized

10:41.634 --> 10:45.437
what a mistake I had made,
but I couldn't take it back.

10:45.472 --> 10:47.073
What? You think
you can take it back now?

10:47.089 --> 10:48.607
- I'm still your wife, Auggie.
- Really?

10:48.641 --> 10:49.942
Because the last time
you were here,

10:49.976 --> 10:51.193
you made it very clear
that's not the case.

10:51.227 --> 10:52.528
You have not been my wife

10:52.562 --> 10:54.696
since the second
you became somebody else

10:54.731 --> 10:56.031
other than Helen Hansen.

10:56.065 --> 10:57.065
I don't know who you are.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.233
I am still the same person.

10:58.267 --> 11:01.236
Well, I'm not.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.906
I watched you die.

11:03.940 --> 11:07.776
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to get over that?

11:07.794 --> 11:09.277
And it was all a lie.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.914
I understand, and I hope
under all that hurt and anger,

11:11.948 --> 11:13.749
you will too someday.

11:13.783 --> 11:15.083
We loved each other, Auggie.

11:15.117 --> 11:18.286
It was a long time ago,
just like you said.

11:20.306 --> 11:23.291
I can't change what I did,

11:23.309 --> 11:24.960
but I can help all of you
against Henry--

11:24.978 --> 11:26.512
make him pay
for what he's done.

11:26.563 --> 11:28.180
He's the real enemy,
isn't he?

11:29.732 --> 11:32.518
This is the necklace
you gave me in Rome.

11:32.569 --> 11:35.237
I never stopped wearing it.

11:41.995 --> 11:44.663
Maybe it's time you did.

11:47.316 --> 11:50.118
I'll let you know
what I find out about Henry.

12:03.967 --> 12:05.601
Have they I.D.'d the body yet?

12:05.635 --> 12:06.635
I don't know.

12:06.669 --> 12:08.103
Is David still with you?

12:08.137 --> 12:09.188
He went to the gym.

12:09.222 --> 12:10.939
Did you find anything
on the laptop?

12:10.974 --> 12:12.340
No, the laptop
was safeguarded--

12:12.358 --> 12:13.392
professional grade.

12:13.443 --> 12:14.893
It's gonna need
brute-force decryption.

12:14.944 --> 12:16.061
Can you do that?

12:16.112 --> 12:18.864
No, but there was something on
the flash drive.

12:18.898 --> 12:19.865
Something?

12:19.899 --> 12:22.367
Files.

12:22.402 --> 12:25.204
Files?

12:25.238 --> 12:28.189
Tell me--what's Henry's plan?
What are the files for?

12:28.208 --> 12:29.575
To set David up.

12:29.626 --> 12:32.077
To make it look like he knew
about the attack in Copenhagen--

12:32.128 --> 12:33.412
like he profited from it,

12:33.463 --> 12:34.963
that he had inside knowledge.

12:34.998 --> 12:36.381
David had nothing to do
with that.

12:36.416 --> 12:39.084
I know, but Henry wants it
to look that way.

12:39.135 --> 12:42.588
So what are you gonna do?

12:42.639 --> 12:44.806
I'm working on a plan
as we speak.

13:03.276 --> 13:04.943
Jessica?

13:09.616 --> 13:11.066
David.
Hi.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.734
Good morning.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.169
You're in early.

13:14.203 --> 13:16.838
Yeah, I was just working.

13:16.873 --> 13:18.624
Let's talk about
what happened yesterday.

13:18.675 --> 13:20.626
I'm so sorry.

13:20.677 --> 13:22.294
Um, what did Sana say?

13:22.345 --> 13:25.130
She tried to calm you down.

13:25.181 --> 13:28.583
I was so angry at you,

13:28.601 --> 13:31.419
but then she made me realize
that what happened yesterday

13:31.437 --> 13:34.139
was Goodman's fault,
not yours.

13:34.190 --> 13:36.642
She's the saucer to my teacup.

13:36.693 --> 13:39.811
She is a remarkable woman.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.446
You know what?

13:41.481 --> 13:45.433
I'm going to call Goodman today
to read him the riot act.

13:50.573 --> 13:52.874
I've been waiting over a week
for a new hard drive, okay?

13:52.909 --> 13:54.543
If, if, if--
Auggie, sorry, man.

13:54.577 --> 13:55.610
Just give me one second.

13:55.628 --> 13:57.278
If I could buy one
and bring it in,

13:57.297 --> 13:58.613
you know I would do that,
okay?

13:58.631 --> 14:00.281
Barber.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.950
Never mind.
I got it.

14:01.968 --> 14:02.951
Thank you.

14:02.969 --> 14:04.285
Sincerely,
thank you so much.

14:04.304 --> 14:06.287
It's good to have friends
in low places.

14:06.306 --> 14:08.123
Oh, man, is this what
they have you doing now?

14:08.141 --> 14:10.792
No, it's a special delivery.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.227
Where were you last night?

14:12.261 --> 14:14.479
I thought you were gonna finally
come out to Allen's, man.

14:14.514 --> 14:16.154
It's been way too long
since you came out.

14:16.182 --> 14:18.984
Yeah, I--I got caught up.

14:19.018 --> 14:22.154
Hey, what's with all these
background checks?

14:22.188 --> 14:27.075
There is an increasingly thick
cloud of paranoia going around.

14:27.110 --> 14:28.476
You know,
I thought it was just me.

14:28.494 --> 14:29.778
It's not.

14:29.812 --> 14:31.580
They're adding servers
to hold extra data,

14:31.614 --> 14:34.583
and I heard Braithwaite
opened a blue file

14:34.617 --> 14:36.084
on Henry Wilcox.

14:36.119 --> 14:38.253
Really?

14:38.287 --> 14:39.755
Huh.

14:39.789 --> 14:41.923
I thought Wilcox had Braithwaite
in his pocket.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.258
I did too.

14:45.128 --> 14:48.597
Hey, keep that one
under your hat, all right?

14:48.631 --> 14:49.931
Yeah,
it's under the hat, man.

14:49.966 --> 14:51.633
It's under the hat.

14:56.439 --> 14:57.556
Hey, Tommy.

14:57.607 --> 14:58.607
Tommy.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.060
How'd it go with patient zero?

15:02.111 --> 15:05.013
One wedge between Henry
and Braithwaite coming up.

15:05.031 --> 15:07.031
It still amazes me
how bad a building full of spies

15:07.033 --> 15:08.850
is at keeping a secret.

15:08.868 --> 15:10.285
When will we know
this is working?

15:10.319 --> 15:12.621
When Henry wants to talk
to you instead of Braithwaite.

15:12.655 --> 15:13.955
Let me know
when he reaches out.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.157
Yeah.

15:42.819 --> 15:44.770
Who are those people?

15:44.821 --> 15:46.271
They said
they're with Interpol.

16:01.754 --> 16:02.904
- David?
- Interpol--

16:02.922 --> 16:04.239
they're bringing me down
to their offices

16:04.257 --> 16:05.907
for questioning
about some files on my computer.

16:05.925 --> 16:07.008
About what?

16:07.043 --> 16:08.293
They think
I had something to do

16:08.344 --> 16:10.545
with the helicopter
going down in Copenhagen.

16:12.248 --> 16:13.548
It's just a misunderstanding.

16:13.582 --> 16:14.716
Call Colin's firm.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.134
Tell him to meet me
at the Interpol office.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.352
Of course.

16:21.941 --> 16:23.975
Everybody, back to work.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.694
It'll be fine.

16:32.452 --> 16:34.602
Jessica...

16:34.620 --> 16:36.288
Jessica.

16:41.294 --> 16:43.111
Everything you said happened.

16:43.129 --> 16:45.780
They came after David.

16:45.798 --> 16:47.115
How did Henry do it?

16:47.133 --> 16:49.784
How did he get the files
on David's computer?

16:49.802 --> 16:53.788
Henry didn't do it.

16:53.806 --> 16:55.123
I did.

16:55.141 --> 16:56.624
I loaded the files
this morning.

16:56.642 --> 16:59.094
You had Interpol
drag my fiance away?

16:59.128 --> 17:01.096
No.
Henry must have called Interpol.

17:01.130 --> 17:03.431
It's the next logical phase
in his plan.

17:03.465 --> 17:06.434
Sana, as soon as Henry realizes
Andrew Goodman is dead,

17:06.468 --> 17:08.936
there is nothing else
we can do.

17:08.971 --> 17:11.940
He expected Andrew
to plant that intel,

17:11.973 --> 17:13.608
so I did it.

17:13.642 --> 17:15.277
It's a calculated risk,

17:15.310 --> 17:18.113
but David will be fine as soon
as the real truth emerges.

17:18.146 --> 17:19.614
You said
you were working on a plan.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.584
I figured we'd discuss it
before you acted.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.419
You said you had a hard time
lying to David,

17:24.453 --> 17:26.755
so I prevented you
from having to do that again.

17:26.789 --> 17:27.756
How lofty.

17:27.790 --> 17:28.924
So you did this for me?

17:28.958 --> 17:30.425
I am trying to prove

17:30.459 --> 17:33.595
that Henry is the architect
of the Copenhagen attacks.

17:33.629 --> 17:35.764
We are following the money.

17:35.798 --> 17:38.934
Finding out how Henry
moves his cash is the first step

17:38.968 --> 17:41.836
into getting David free,
and I have a way we can do that.

17:41.854 --> 17:45.506
David was already free.

17:45.525 --> 17:48.527
Henry is the reason
your son is dead.

17:52.565 --> 17:54.533
Explain that.

17:54.567 --> 17:56.568
I was there
when the bomb went off.

18:00.072 --> 18:04.376
Jai and I had met at a diner.

18:04.410 --> 18:07.712
I was supposed to be in the car
with him,

18:07.747 --> 18:11.550
but I forgot my umbrella.

18:11.584 --> 18:14.719
That's when it happened.

18:14.754 --> 18:16.371
And Henry did this?

18:16.389 --> 18:17.672
What did he tell you?

18:17.706 --> 18:19.257
He said it was
Arthur Campbell's fault,

18:19.308 --> 18:22.427
that soon the world
would know the truth.

18:22.478 --> 18:23.929
And he was angry.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.680
It wasn't anger.

18:25.714 --> 18:28.683
It was guilt.

18:28.717 --> 18:31.019
The man who set the bomb
was a former operative

18:31.053 --> 18:33.688
that Henry
had turned his back on.

18:33.722 --> 18:37.025
Henry has been projecting
his guilt about Jai's death

18:37.059 --> 18:39.611
onto everyone around him...

18:39.662 --> 18:43.448
Destroying lives.

18:43.499 --> 18:48.119
He is not gonna stop
until someone stops him.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.955
Let's stop him.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.876
What do you want me to do?

18:54.910 --> 18:58.546
We're gonna need
somewhere more private.

18:58.580 --> 19:01.082
There's an empty office space
upstairs.

19:21.657 --> 19:24.158
I think that's a better cigar,
so I'll take 20 of those.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.502
Politics are a funny game.

19:37.172 --> 19:40.475
Perhaps if we'd treated Fidel
a bit differently,

19:40.509 --> 19:43.811
we could be shopping
for the good stuff.

19:43.845 --> 19:46.648
Henry, I--I didn't know
you were a cigar man.

19:46.682 --> 19:48.816
I have many vices.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.202
What's this I hear about
you opening a blue file on me?

19:51.236 --> 19:54.155
Where'd you hear that?

19:54.189 --> 19:55.356
- So it's true?
- Not, it's not.

19:55.374 --> 19:58.192
It's--no.

19:58.210 --> 20:02.363
Look, whoever told you that
is mistaken.

20:02.381 --> 20:04.532
If you want
what Castro smokes,

20:04.550 --> 20:06.801
talk to Arturo
in the back room.

20:06.835 --> 20:08.636
Tell him I sent you.

20:08.671 --> 20:12.807
But honestly, I think
they're too strong for you.

20:26.722 --> 20:28.156
Hello, Sana.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.490
What a surprise.

20:29.525 --> 20:30.825
So good to hear from you.

20:30.859 --> 20:32.499
I hope I haven't caught you
at a bad time.

20:32.528 --> 20:34.579
It's always a good time
to hear your voice,

20:34.613 --> 20:37.248
though, I'm hearing
something in it.

20:37.282 --> 20:39.033
Is everything all right?

20:39.067 --> 20:41.869
I've been thinking about
what you said in Frankfurt--

20:41.903 --> 20:43.538
what you said about David.

20:43.572 --> 20:44.539
What did he do?

20:44.573 --> 20:47.542
He's in trouble.

20:47.576 --> 20:50.678
Henry, I'd really rather not
do this on the phone.

20:50.713 --> 20:52.013
Can you come to Geneva?

20:52.047 --> 20:53.181
Of course.

20:53.215 --> 20:54.495
I can get on the next plane out.

20:54.516 --> 20:55.800
Thank you, Henry.

20:55.851 --> 20:57.418
I meant what I said
in Frankfurt.

20:57.436 --> 20:59.020
I'd do anything for you.

20:59.054 --> 21:00.722
See you soon.

21:06.028 --> 21:07.145
So he's coming to Geneva.

21:07.196 --> 21:10.314
What now?

21:10.365 --> 21:12.984
We'll reconvene in the morning
before you sit down with Henry.

21:13.035 --> 21:15.319
And do the thing I vowed
I'd never do again.

21:15.370 --> 21:17.155
He's coming to Geneva
for you.

21:17.206 --> 21:18.706
You're in control.

21:18.741 --> 21:21.375
My fiance's in custody,
and I'm taking orders from you.

21:21.410 --> 21:24.162
Forgive me
for not feeling in control.

21:34.556 --> 21:36.841
Auggie.

21:36.892 --> 21:39.627
Joan.

21:39.645 --> 21:41.629
What are you doing
down here in I.T.?

21:41.647 --> 21:43.147
I...

21:45.150 --> 21:49.970
I saw you talking
to Calder.

21:49.988 --> 21:51.972
Yeah, we work
for the same agency.

21:51.990 --> 21:54.308
It couldn't be helped.

21:54.326 --> 21:56.310
What's going on?

21:56.328 --> 21:58.329
What do you mean?

22:02.167 --> 22:05.653
I mean, Calder killed Annie.

22:05.671 --> 22:08.322
I'm stunned you'd even be
acknowledging him.

22:08.340 --> 22:10.991
Now, if you tell me
you've been keeping tabs on him

22:11.009 --> 22:14.161
or investigating him,
I would understand.

22:14.179 --> 22:15.830
I can't talk about it.

22:15.848 --> 22:16.831
Can't or won't?

22:16.849 --> 22:18.999
I can't.
I won't.

22:19.017 --> 22:20.501
This isn't like you.

22:20.519 --> 22:23.170
What about you?

22:23.188 --> 22:25.189
What about me?

22:30.195 --> 22:34.181
You and Arthur hired Helen.

22:34.199 --> 22:36.517
Yes.
She's following Henry to Geneva.

22:36.535 --> 22:38.853
She's going to Geneva?

22:38.871 --> 22:40.037
We thought she might be able

22:40.072 --> 22:44.709
to shed some light
on Henry's finances.

22:44.743 --> 22:49.380
Auggie, I am working in a box,
pushing papers.

22:49.414 --> 22:50.882
You're down here.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.383
We have both lost so much.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.802
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing everything in my power

22:54.837 --> 22:56.137
to defend my husband.

22:56.171 --> 22:58.005
I'm not asking you
to apologize.

23:01.343 --> 23:05.062
It is just you and me.

23:05.097 --> 23:06.230
We're all that's left.

23:06.265 --> 23:08.516
We both need to remember that.

23:18.827 --> 23:20.778
When are you seeing Henry?

23:20.829 --> 23:22.446
Half an hour.
Cafe Geneve.

23:22.497 --> 23:24.665
It's near the Hotel Dorciere
where he's staying.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.833
45 minutes.

23:25.868 --> 23:27.168
Let's make him wait.

23:27.202 --> 23:28.753
Henry hates waiting.

23:28.787 --> 23:29.921
Exactly.

23:29.955 --> 23:31.405
You may think
that'll soften him up,

23:31.423 --> 23:32.874
but it's not the right move.

23:33.909 --> 23:35.042
That's me calling.

23:35.076 --> 23:36.711
Answer it
and leave the connection open.

23:36.745 --> 23:39.046
Then I can listen
during the meet.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.382
Let's test it.

23:41.416 --> 23:44.719
Henry hates waiting.

23:44.753 --> 23:46.520
We want him on the tilt.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.856
When you sit down, tell him
everything he wants to hear--

23:48.891 --> 23:50.641
that you're worried
about David.

23:50.692 --> 23:51.692
You're in distress.

23:51.727 --> 23:54.528
You mean the truth.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.364
You only have to talk to him
for a little while.

23:56.398 --> 23:58.366
Then I'm gonna throw a wrench
into Henry's world,

23:58.400 --> 23:59.867
and you can leave
right after that.

23:59.902 --> 24:01.369
Where are you gonna be?

24:01.403 --> 24:03.287
I have some related things
I need to take care of.

24:03.322 --> 24:04.455
When I was Henry's asset,

24:04.489 --> 24:05.790
he wouldn't let me
out of his sight

24:05.824 --> 24:06.791
when there was a meet.

24:06.825 --> 24:07.959
They call that infatuation.

24:07.993 --> 24:09.627
I call that
being a great handler.

24:09.661 --> 24:12.463
The man was inclusive
and reassuring--

24:12.497 --> 24:14.131
everything you're not.

24:14.166 --> 24:17.802
We'd go over a scenario
until he knew I felt safe.

24:17.836 --> 24:19.971
He had the luxury of time

24:20.005 --> 24:21.472
and the full backing
of the CIA.

24:21.506 --> 24:22.473
We don't have that.

24:22.507 --> 24:24.642
I don't have that anymore.

24:24.676 --> 24:26.928
This is the best plan, Sana.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.095
You need to trust me.

24:28.129 --> 24:31.432
Can we agree
not to use that word again?

24:31.466 --> 24:34.468
It's much too late for trust.

24:57.619 --> 24:59.754
Sana.

24:59.788 --> 25:00.921
I'm sorry I'm late.

25:00.955 --> 25:02.423
That's quite all right.

25:02.457 --> 25:06.427
They were just playing
some Debussy in the cafe here.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.428
<i>Clair de lune?</i>

25:07.462 --> 25:10.431
Yes.
I figured it was a sign.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.932
Or you planned it.

25:11.966 --> 25:14.101
Nah, if I'd have planned it,
they'd still be playing.

25:15.136 --> 25:18.105
Sit down.

25:18.139 --> 25:19.940
Don't you worry.

25:19.974 --> 25:21.108
Listen to me, Sana.

25:21.142 --> 25:24.161
I already have men
looking into David.

25:24.196 --> 25:27.665
Did you see any of this
happening?

25:27.699 --> 25:30.150
Did you look into him after
what I told you in Frankfurt?

25:30.168 --> 25:33.153
No, I should have.

25:33.171 --> 25:35.923
David's always been
very private.

25:35.957 --> 25:38.092
I can help you.

25:38.126 --> 25:40.428
I can help David.

25:40.462 --> 25:43.330
I can keep you safe.
Safe...

25:43.348 --> 25:44.882
Tell me everything
that's happened,

25:44.933 --> 25:46.100
anything out of the ordinary.

25:46.134 --> 25:47.101
Out of the ordinary?

25:47.135 --> 25:48.135
David's behavior?

25:48.169 --> 25:51.004
Um, new visitors to the office?

25:51.022 --> 25:54.358
Strange interactions?

25:59.231 --> 26:02.399
No, I--I don't know.
It's--

26:02.451 --> 26:03.901
Tell me, Sana.

26:03.952 --> 26:06.120
I need to know everything.

26:08.623 --> 26:10.407
It's this whole situation.

26:10.459 --> 26:12.409
I just can't believe David

26:12.461 --> 26:14.245
would be involved
in something like this.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.832
I'll help get you
through this.

26:17.866 --> 26:20.868
I will always help you.

26:20.886 --> 26:25.005
I've been thinking about Jai,
I've been thinking about us.

26:25.039 --> 26:27.508
Trying to get my life back.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.677
Going back to the Agency?

26:29.711 --> 26:33.981
My new company
is doing the Agency one better.

26:34.015 --> 26:37.485
When all is said and done,
Lexington will make the CIA

26:37.519 --> 26:40.604
look even more out of touch
than it already is.

26:42.824 --> 26:43.941
Excuse me.

26:43.992 --> 26:45.276
Put this away.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.616
Everything okay?

26:52.667 --> 26:53.784
Fine.

26:53.835 --> 26:55.369
If you have something
to take care of,

26:55.403 --> 26:56.704
we can meet later.

26:56.738 --> 26:57.705
No, no--

27:09.384 --> 27:11.352
- I should get going.
- Sana--

27:11.386 --> 27:14.688
It's okay.
It's okay.

27:14.723 --> 27:16.190
Let's speak soon.

27:16.224 --> 27:17.191
Yes.

27:17.225 --> 27:19.026
Thank you, Henry.

27:19.060 --> 27:21.061
You're welcome.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.067
He's still in love with you.

28:00.101 --> 28:01.435
He wants you back.

28:01.469 --> 28:02.603
I heard it in his voice,

28:02.637 --> 28:05.439
and he will do anything
to make that happen,

28:05.473 --> 28:07.908
including paying off Andrew.

28:09.444 --> 28:11.412
Once he wires the money,
we can track the flow

28:11.446 --> 28:12.863
and find out
who he's working with,

28:12.914 --> 28:15.366
and it links him
to our red-haired friend.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.867
This feels speculative.

28:16.918 --> 28:18.485
It's just breadcrumbs.

28:18.503 --> 28:21.488
It's always just breadcrumbs
until it becomes something more.

28:21.506 --> 28:23.156
You know that.

28:25.844 --> 28:27.995
Henry.

28:28.013 --> 28:31.932
We're getting a rise
out of him.

28:32.968 --> 28:34.602
So what the hell
are you doing?

28:34.636 --> 28:37.605
You realize I--I put you
into this game we play,

28:37.639 --> 28:40.441
and I can pluck you out.

28:40.475 --> 28:41.942
I'm sure you wouldn't
want anything

28:41.977 --> 28:43.444
to happen to Violet,
would you?

28:45.146 --> 28:47.781
Do you know who Violet is?

28:47.816 --> 28:48.983
No.

29:32.694 --> 29:36.396
We've got him.

29:40.618 --> 29:42.619
This is gonna work, Sana.

29:53.429 --> 29:54.563
The clock's ticking.

29:54.597 --> 29:56.014
Is the receiving account
all set?

29:56.065 --> 29:57.682
I fabricated a dummy account
for Goodman

29:57.733 --> 30:00.318
through F.I.N.M.A.,
put the necessary e-tags on it.

30:00.353 --> 30:01.770
Once he transfers the money,

30:01.804 --> 30:03.939
we can locate the origin
electronically.

30:03.973 --> 30:05.941
Your breadcrumb.

30:05.975 --> 30:07.275
Yeah.

30:07.309 --> 30:09.277
All this for a breadcrumb.

30:09.311 --> 30:12.313
What's it gonna take
to get the whole bakery?

30:13.366 --> 30:14.833
Nelson, this is me.

30:14.867 --> 30:16.334
I'm--I'm in a bit of a bind.

30:16.369 --> 30:17.836
You're calling me directly?

30:17.870 --> 30:20.672
I need $3 million,
untraceable, fast-tracked.

30:20.706 --> 30:21.840
Okay, all right.

30:21.874 --> 30:24.626
Define "fast-track."

30:24.660 --> 30:25.660
Three hours.

30:25.678 --> 30:26.661
Where are you?

30:26.679 --> 30:28.496
Geneva.

30:28.514 --> 30:30.131
You're in Gen--

30:30.165 --> 30:32.006
look, I can't bend the laws
of space and time--

30:32.018 --> 30:35.937
I've done enough business
with you to warrant this favor.

30:35.972 --> 30:37.839
I'll do my best.

30:37.857 --> 30:39.858
Thank you, Nelson.

30:45.014 --> 30:46.982
All right, no more meeting
inside the building.

30:47.016 --> 30:48.650
We have to continue
to talk like this.

30:48.684 --> 30:49.701
Yeah.

30:49.735 --> 30:51.203
Henry's office called me
today.

30:51.237 --> 30:55.040
He wants to sit down in two days
when he's back in town...

30:55.074 --> 30:57.709
without Braithwaite.

30:57.743 --> 31:00.879
Henry's in Geneva.

31:00.913 --> 31:03.048
How do you know that?

31:03.082 --> 31:04.216
It's complicated.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.383
That's not an answer.

31:05.418 --> 31:06.551
Are you in touch with Annie?

31:06.586 --> 31:07.719
Absolutely not.

31:07.753 --> 31:09.137
But you want to reach out now,
don't you?

31:09.171 --> 31:10.305
Absolutely not.

31:10.339 --> 31:11.806
That'd put her at risk.

31:11.841 --> 31:15.477
Annie's gonna have to live
through this mission by herself.

31:15.511 --> 31:17.512
Remember that.

31:23.936 --> 31:25.186
Yeah?

31:25.220 --> 31:27.689
I found somebody
who can accommodate your needs.

31:27.723 --> 31:29.741
I just need to know
where to send the funds.

31:29.775 --> 31:31.243
Excellent.

31:31.277 --> 31:35.947
I'll email you the receivable
account details shortly.

31:44.173 --> 31:45.290
What do you got for me?

31:45.341 --> 31:47.342
I found
what you were looking for.

31:49.879 --> 31:54.015
Where's
my blackmailing friend?

31:54.050 --> 31:56.851
He's dead.

31:56.886 --> 32:00.722
They have him at the morgue
at the Rue de Montbrillant.

32:03.192 --> 32:05.310
He was found
in a woman's apartment.

32:05.361 --> 32:07.646
We're checking it out.

32:07.697 --> 32:09.981
How long has he been dead?

32:10.032 --> 32:12.651
Hard to say exactly.

32:12.702 --> 32:15.036
They've had him
at least one day, though.

32:30.136 --> 32:31.619
It's 4:00.

32:31.637 --> 32:32.787
Henry's out of time.

32:32.805 --> 32:34.288
Did the money transfer
go through?

32:34.307 --> 32:36.308
No.

32:38.144 --> 32:39.344
Then it didn't work.

32:39.395 --> 32:40.512
Henry's always on time.

32:40.563 --> 32:42.180
I told you that.

32:42.231 --> 32:43.348
What happens now?

32:43.399 --> 32:44.465
What happens to David?

32:51.407 --> 32:52.357
Hello?

32:52.408 --> 32:55.527
Jess, we need to talk
right away.

32:55.578 --> 32:57.579
There's a problem.

34:23.114 --> 34:24.748
One of those for me?

34:24.784 --> 34:28.735
Decaf for
the baby coffee-drinker in you.

34:28.754 --> 34:29.754
Thank you.

34:29.789 --> 34:31.755
Nice office.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.542
There's a chair to your left.

34:34.576 --> 34:36.210
You know,
I've been thinking.

34:36.245 --> 34:37.879
You were right.

34:37.913 --> 34:42.717
We are it in this building,
and we should share intel.

34:42.751 --> 34:44.719
So you want to know
if Helen found anything?

34:44.753 --> 34:46.587
Oh, the thought had crossed
my mind.

34:46.605 --> 34:48.056
I thought this was
a peace offering,

34:48.090 --> 34:49.056
but it's a bribe.

34:49.091 --> 34:52.060
It's a latte.

34:52.094 --> 34:53.228
I haven't heard from Helen.

34:53.262 --> 34:54.395
I expected her back by now,

34:54.429 --> 34:55.563
but she hasn't reached out.

34:55.597 --> 34:56.563
Hmm.

34:56.598 --> 34:57.565
Now you.

34:57.599 --> 35:00.235
Me what?

35:00.269 --> 35:01.486
Better give me some intel,

35:01.537 --> 35:04.873
or I'm gonna think
you're withholding.

35:04.907 --> 35:07.492
I hear Braithwaite's
on the outs with Henry.

35:07.543 --> 35:08.493
That's interesting.

35:08.544 --> 35:09.665
That syncs up with the rumor

35:09.712 --> 35:11.246
that's been going
around the building

35:11.280 --> 35:13.447
that Braithwaite opened
an investigation into Henry,

35:13.466 --> 35:15.283
his company,
and all of his holdings

35:15.301 --> 35:17.952
since he left prison.

35:17.970 --> 35:21.639
You didn't have anything
to do with that, did you?

35:24.126 --> 35:29.097
You know who would have
appreciated a move like that?

35:29.131 --> 35:31.933
Annie.

35:31.967 --> 35:35.636
Any good spy would have
appreciated a move like that.

35:35.654 --> 35:39.140
Yeah, but it's Annie
we're mourning,

35:39.158 --> 35:42.327
and I still want to know
why you were talking to Calder.

35:51.954 --> 35:53.087
Sana?

35:53.122 --> 35:55.423
Another difference
between you and Henry--

35:55.457 --> 35:57.091
he'd give me
reassuring phone calls.

35:57.126 --> 35:58.426
You just leave me to wait--

35:58.460 --> 35:59.761
I'm compromised.

35:59.795 --> 36:01.095
I have to leave Geneva.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.131
We need to set up protocols
for what to do next.

36:03.165 --> 36:04.966
No, David's bond hearing
is set for tomorrow.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.500
I will get you
some burner phones--

36:25.704 --> 36:29.523
Hello, Sana.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.709
I've been looking for you.

36:46.695 --> 36:48.313
Nice space.

36:48.364 --> 36:50.815
Your secretary said
you've been coming up here a lot

36:50.866 --> 36:52.867
the past few days.

36:56.121 --> 36:57.772
Anyone else up here with you?

36:57.790 --> 36:59.106
No, it's just me.

36:59.124 --> 37:01.776
Have you heard anything
about David?

37:01.794 --> 37:04.779
Were you able to speak to any
of your friends at Interpol?

37:04.797 --> 37:06.614
They're working on it.

37:06.632 --> 37:09.450
I'll have more concrete answers
for you soon.

37:09.468 --> 37:11.285
I still don't understand
what happened.

37:11.303 --> 37:14.789
Sana, I don't mean this
to sound cold, but...

37:14.807 --> 37:16.808
What is it?

37:22.648 --> 37:24.632
Have you completely discounted
the possibility

37:24.650 --> 37:29.303
that he may be guilty?

37:29.321 --> 37:32.156
We never know people
as well as we think we do...

37:36.161 --> 37:39.146
Even those we love.

37:39.164 --> 37:40.314
Why do I feel like

37:40.332 --> 37:41.916
we're not talking about David
anymore?

37:41.951 --> 37:44.419
There was a brief moment
yesterday

37:44.453 --> 37:47.121
where things felt right
between us,

37:47.155 --> 37:52.126
sitting together at lunch
like old times.

37:52.160 --> 37:58.466
Right after our song
had just played,

37:58.500 --> 38:02.470
I had hope for us again.

38:02.504 --> 38:04.806
There was a sparkle
in your eyes,

38:04.840 --> 38:07.475
but that sparkle
wasn't love.

38:07.509 --> 38:09.811
It was betrayal.

38:09.845 --> 38:11.312
You betrayed me.

38:11.346 --> 38:13.681
You're scaring me, Henry.

38:16.819 --> 38:21.122
You're all mixed up,
not sure who to trust.

38:21.156 --> 38:22.290
Seems this...

38:23.959 --> 38:27.078
Jessica Matthews
has been a bad influence.

38:27.129 --> 38:28.579
She pulled you in,

38:28.631 --> 38:32.300
convinced you
to help her blackmail me.

38:34.169 --> 38:35.303
Where is she, Sana?

38:35.337 --> 38:36.638
I don't know.

38:36.672 --> 38:37.972
I'll find her.

38:38.007 --> 38:40.341
You know I will.

38:43.178 --> 38:45.313
The authorities are looking
for an Indian woman

38:45.347 --> 38:49.350
in connection with
the death of Andrew Goodman.

38:51.654 --> 38:53.271
Someone saw you
in that apartment.

38:53.322 --> 38:57.058
Is that a threat
or more blackmail?

38:57.076 --> 39:00.061
There are only two options
with you.

39:00.079 --> 39:01.896
You know me that well.

39:01.914 --> 39:04.065
Fine.
It's a threat.

39:04.083 --> 39:06.233
David will never get out
of this mess with Interpol.

39:06.251 --> 39:07.585
I'll see to that.

39:10.923 --> 39:15.743
I loved you, Sana,
with all my heart.

39:15.761 --> 39:17.745
Everything I've done
has been for you and Jai.

39:17.763 --> 39:22.100
Don't use us as a way
to justify your evil deeds.

39:23.602 --> 39:26.253
You're a monster, Henry.

39:26.271 --> 39:28.272
Own it.

39:33.896 --> 39:36.531
Fine.

39:36.565 --> 39:41.569
I'm going to find
Jessica Matthews and kill her.

39:56.752 --> 39:57.885
Are you okay?

39:57.920 --> 39:58.886
Did you hear him?

39:58.921 --> 40:00.388
He's gonna kill you.

40:00.422 --> 40:03.558
Leave now.

40:03.592 --> 40:05.727
There's still a way
out of this for you and David.

40:05.761 --> 40:08.730
Don't act like
you care about us.

40:08.764 --> 40:11.516
You used us
every step of the way.

40:11.567 --> 40:13.935
You scorched the earth,
just like Henry.

40:13.969 --> 40:17.438
Sana, I'm sorry
about all of this,

40:17.472 --> 40:19.190
but we can't stop fighting.

40:19.241 --> 40:20.908
We still have
Goodman's computer.

40:20.943 --> 40:22.076
We still have moves to make.

40:22.111 --> 40:23.411
We?

40:23.445 --> 40:25.813
All I've seen is you,
your agenda.

40:25.831 --> 40:28.151
You don't seem to be a person
that cares about anyone else.

40:28.167 --> 40:29.316
You're wrong.

40:29.334 --> 40:31.035
I care about everyone
I am fighting for,

40:31.086 --> 40:32.153
including you.

40:32.171 --> 40:35.173
We are done.

40:35.207 --> 40:39.844
To beat Henry,
you have to become him,

40:39.878 --> 40:41.879
and perhaps you have.

40:43.215 --> 40:45.049
You're a monster too,
Jessica.

40:48.387 --> 40:51.022
- Sana--
- No, get out of here.

40:51.056 --> 40:53.057
Now.
