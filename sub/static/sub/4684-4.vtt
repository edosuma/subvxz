WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.700
No, no, no.

00:02.766 --> 00:04.733
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.900
Here's what's
on my mind, tonight.

00:10.166 --> 00:13.466
A veteran photographer was

00:10.166 --> 00:13.466
one last shot at the big time.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.000
Halloween issue, key layout.

00:15.066 --> 00:17.266
- 'You still have the touch?'
- Razor sharp.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.400
But high fashion
demands a cutting edge.

00:20.466 --> 00:22.600
- You want to make her scream?
- Yes.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.800
So, an expert
gets into the picture.

00:24.866 --> 00:26.333
Hey, babe!

00:26.400 --> 00:29.433
But who will pay the high
cost for Freddy's services?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.633
Keep the motivation,
Kiki, it's wonderful.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.733
A special Halloween treat
on "Freddy's Nightmares".

00:55.233 --> 00:57.600
You're in Springwood, now.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.733
And you're all mine!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.633
Do we have to say cheese?

02:15.700 --> 02:17.100
Cheese?

02:17.166 --> 02:19.433
Yeah, you always
have us say cheese.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.000
'Our cue to smile.'

02:21.066 --> 02:23.300
Yeah, I like to say cheese

02:23.366 --> 02:25.466
Yes, you can say cheese.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.833
Always works like a charm.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.833
Every year your pictures

02:26.900 --> 02:29.833
come to us and they look great!

02:29.900 --> 02:32.366
- So..
- Must be the cheese.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.866
Well, it seems to
capture the moment just great.

02:34.933 --> 02:38.800
'Alright, now you hold that.'

02:38.866 --> 02:39.800
Okay, good.

02:39.866 --> 02:43.100
And cheese!

02:43.166 --> 02:45.233
Cheese!

02:45.300 --> 02:46.766
All set!

02:46.833 --> 02:49.133
Okay, I will have
these for you real soon.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.700
Thank you, very much.

02:50.766 --> 02:53.000
Do you realize, you've taken
our annual family portrait

02:53.066 --> 02:54.666
since Debbie was three.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.700
Oh, I didn't realize
it had been so long.

02:56.766 --> 02:58.266
We hope you've enjoyed
watching her grow up

02:58.333 --> 03:01.233
as much as we have.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.933
Wow, did you
used to be somebody?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.966
Uh, yes!

03:06.033 --> 03:07.000
Thank you.

03:07.066 --> 03:08.866
Oh, this award was when?

03:08.933 --> 03:12.366
Oh, uh, fifteen years ago.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.233
Well, we're honored to have
someone of your caliber

03:15.300 --> 03:16.700
taking our photograph.

03:16.766 --> 03:19.233
And we look forward
to coming back every year

03:19.300 --> 03:20.900
until we're all old and gray.

03:22.366 --> 03:25.500
- Cant wait.
- 'What?'

03:25.566 --> 03:28.900
I said that, uh,
that'd be great.

03:42.466 --> 03:45.633
- Hello.
- 'Hello, is this Stoney Adler?'

03:45.700 --> 03:46.633
You got her.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.933
Is this the right
Stoney Adler?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.900
The one who took the photo
of topless

03:49.966 --> 03:51.900
revisited in silk?

03:51.966 --> 03:55.233
- Yeah, that's my photo.
- 'Great, ever here of Kink?'

03:56.233 --> 03:57.866
Well, I was open to it.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.466
No, the magazine.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.766
Uh, never mind. We're new.
We haven't come out yet.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.300
I'm the editor, Torrie Bodnar.

04:03.366 --> 04:05.166
Oh, good for you.

04:05.233 --> 04:07.166
'We're not men's rag
with sleazy pictures.'

04:07.233 --> 04:09.900
We're culture statement, you
know the art about the bizarre.

04:09.966 --> 04:11.600
We're arresting
and trend setting.

04:11.666 --> 04:13.300
Oh, what do you want with me?

04:13.366 --> 04:14.766
'I haven't seen
your work in years.'

04:14.833 --> 04:17.200
'What happened to you?'

04:17.266 --> 04:20.066
Oh, I was away.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.866
Long trip. How'd you
end up in Springwood?

04:21.933 --> 04:23.900
Is that anywhere
or just nowhere?

04:23.966 --> 04:25.833
It's, uh, somewhere in between.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.766
Umm, what do you want?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.666
When I was a kid,
I loved your work.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.466
Yeah, you sound like
you're still a kid.

04:32.533 --> 04:36.233
'No way. I'm 27 and I need
someone like you on the Kink.'

04:36.300 --> 04:40.100
You're forte was cutting edge,
borderline, wild, racky..

04:40.166 --> 04:41.633
- Racky?
- 'Yeah.'

04:41.700 --> 04:43.633
'Out there, really reaching.'

04:43.700 --> 04:46.466
Oh, right. Racky.

04:46.533 --> 04:49.433
I've got a deadline
if you can handle it.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.533
Try me.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.033
Halloween issue, key layout.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.166
Need it in a week
using top three models.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.766
Do you still have the touch?

04:56.833 --> 04:58.066
Razor sharp.

04:58.133 --> 05:00.833
Great. If this works,
I'd say you're back.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.533
'Now, that's razor sharp.'

05:15.400 --> 05:18.200
Real cuttin' edge.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.066
It's Halloween.

05:20.133 --> 05:21.400
And I'm going to treat

05:21.466 --> 05:25.266
that nice female photographer

05:25.333 --> 05:27.900
to a couple of tricks.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.033
'I love playing head games!'

05:57.866 --> 06:00.566
Oh, I feel stupid.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.766
Try, uh, moving the broom.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.000
It's got splinters.

06:04.066 --> 06:05.900
And the straw itches.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.133
And this-this dress,
it's crawling up my butt.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.066
Alright, alright,
let's break for five.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.300
You know, I only took this

06:17.366 --> 06:19.200
because Kink
is supposed to be so hot.

06:19.266 --> 06:21.200
Only the best.

06:23.033 --> 06:25.033
How come I don't know you?

06:26.966 --> 06:29.133
Does it come as a shock
to you that Paul McCartney

06:29.200 --> 06:31.033
was in another
band before Wings?

06:31.100 --> 06:33.700
Uh, I gotta call my agent, okay?

06:33.766 --> 06:35.533
Yeah. Okay.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.633
Then change for The Ripper.

06:42.366 --> 06:44.333
Oh, boy.

06:47.033 --> 06:50.000
This is cool, right?
It leaks.

06:50.066 --> 06:53.033
But I got this thing.
It lands on this.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.766
What i-what is this
Who are you?

06:55.833 --> 06:59.333
Oliver. Uh, your new assistant.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.133
Torrie Bodnar,
that Kink editor.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.600
Said you could
use and abuse me.

07:03.666 --> 07:06.900
Oh, so, umm..

07:06.966 --> 07:09.766
You know anything
about photography?

07:09.833 --> 07:11.966
Just what you'll tell me.

07:12.033 --> 07:14.000
'But I can hang out
and do stuff.'

07:14.066 --> 07:16.533
I-I see. You're good
at stuff, huh?

07:18.133 --> 07:21.433
Well, listen, why don't you, uh,
stuff this behind the stike.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.266
Uh, stike?

07:25.333 --> 07:27.433
Yes, it's the big gray thing.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.466
Gray thing, cool.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.766
You know, you're red.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.300
- Very hot.
- What?

07:34.366 --> 07:36.700
Your aura, I can see it.

07:36.766 --> 07:39.500
It's about out to here.

07:39.566 --> 07:43.433
- It's red, very hot.
- It's hot.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.666
Yeah, you should
de-stress or something.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.933
Oh, I see, so I'm stressed
Is that what hot means?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.766
Either that, or you
used to be good and bad.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.100
'I'll read up on it.'

07:53.166 --> 07:54.833
I used to do crystals, but, uh

07:54.900 --> 07:56.533
auras are a real kick.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.366
Not totally on top them, yet.

07:58.433 --> 08:02.133
- Alert me when you are.
- 'Cool, you got it.'

08:02.200 --> 08:05.300
- Oh, how about I stuff this?
- 'Hey, stuff away.'

08:05.366 --> 08:07.666
Hey, you know what,
then grab that pile of props

08:07.733 --> 08:10.933
and drag 'em over in front
of the, uh, big gray thing.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.266
Yeah, the ones labeled "Ripper".

08:13.333 --> 08:14.700
Ha, like "Jack the Ripper"?

08:14.766 --> 08:16.133
One and the same.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.133
Whoa, hey, racky!

08:38.366 --> 08:40.300
'What do you see?'

08:43.000 --> 08:45.833
I see...Jody as the witch.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.933
Talk to me.
What do you think?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.733
Well, it's not exactly racky.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.300
Well, you've got
that stuff right.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.233
I'm looking at it too,
Oliver sneaked me a copy.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.366
Nice of him.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.566
Yeah, well, I've got
a job for you.

08:57.633 --> 09:00.566
A new one. One you&lt;i

09:00.633 --> 09:03.100
Oliver should have a setup
in your studio, right now.

09:03.166 --> 09:06.333
You should be doing
this one for the next 20 years.

09:14.966 --> 09:16.300
Congratulations!

09:16.366 --> 09:18.000
You're the new
official photographer

09:18.066 --> 09:21.600
for all the laminated
restaurant menus in the country.

09:21.666 --> 09:24.300
- You want it over here?
- What?

09:24.366 --> 09:26.400
You want it over here?

09:27.566 --> 09:29.933
'Uh, yeah, yeah, that's good.'

09:30.000 --> 09:32.666
I don't see what this
has to do with Halloween.

09:32.733 --> 09:34.966
I'm gonna pop right out of this.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.500
That's cool. Trick and treat.

09:37.566 --> 09:39.533
Oh, get back, buddy.

09:41.133 --> 09:43.633
So, I guess, uh,
a date is out of the question.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.200
Are we gonna do this?

09:48.266 --> 09:50.333
Yeah! Yeah, let's shoot it.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.233
'Umm, Oliver turn on
the fog machine'

09:54.300 --> 09:56.933
and, uh, then go down to
the camera store on the corner

09:57.000 --> 09:59.166
and ask 'em for Stoney's usual.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.766
I can do that.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.066
And have to be
real careful with this fog

10:04.133 --> 10:05.800
It's very slippery.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.166
I have a layout
in Paris next week.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.866
If I fall and break something,
we're talking big bucks here.

10:10.933 --> 10:14.000
Oh, so, don't fall.

10:14.066 --> 10:16.333
Well, we better it shoot
before my eyes get too red.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.600
Now, why are your
eyes gonna get red?

10:20.666 --> 10:23.033
Jordan Kingman's?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.433
Major had to be there.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.200
Always runs late.

10:27.266 --> 10:28.900
No sleep.

10:28.966 --> 10:30.966
Why don't you
just close your eyes?

10:31.033 --> 10:33.033
Rest against the lamp post?

10:34.366 --> 10:36.400
And don't say anything.

10:36.466 --> 10:38.833
'Just let the fog build up,
while I load the camera.'

11:02.666 --> 11:05.433
It's cold outside..

11:05.500 --> 11:07.733
...but death is colder.

11:09.033 --> 11:10.566
Not bad.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.700
But this is bad!

11:14.600 --> 11:17.033
No, uh-uh, no!

11:17.100 --> 11:18.366
That's wonderful! Wonderful!

11:18.433 --> 11:20.900
'Please! Please! Uh, aah!

11:27.366 --> 11:31.033
Ooh, my beautiful
show some emotion.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.900
'Please, please, no!'

11:36.800 --> 11:38.366
'Ah, no!'

11:38.433 --> 11:40.366
Oh, yes, my princess.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.733
Very good.

11:43.633 --> 11:46.200
Great! Super.
I love it, I love it!

11:46.266 --> 11:47.533
'Help me, God!'

11:49.566 --> 11:51.366
Just move, be loose, be loose.

11:51.433 --> 11:52.533
Keep yelling!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.500
And now, my beauty!

11:54.566 --> 11:57.533
Dance! Dance! Dance!

11:59.000 --> 12:01.066
Oh, my God!

12:03.533 --> 12:05.400
- Where'd he go?
- Are you okay?

12:05.466 --> 12:06.733
That was great!

12:06.800 --> 12:08.466
Come on, let's go again,
right away.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.133
Get away from me, you're crazy.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.400
- Why, what's wrong?
- Ask your sick-o friend.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.633
Oliver?

12:26.366 --> 12:28.533
You're out of there, pal.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.800
And tell Sally,
I'm keeping her leather jacket.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.333
Okay, I'm ready.
What do you want me to do?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.866
I'd like you to climb
in the coffin and get comfy.

12:47.966 --> 12:51.300
- Hello.
- Stoney Adler, Torrie Bodnar.

12:51.366 --> 12:52.433
Right both times.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.833
- 'It is the most..'
- Most what?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.433
"Jack The Ripper" stuff.
The most great photos!

12:58.500 --> 13:00.000
Dead on target!

13:00.066 --> 13:01.766
- You liked it?
- 'Yeah.'

13:01.833 --> 13:03.066
Great! Take it even further!

13:03.133 --> 13:05.066
Right to the edge.
Make it controversial.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.366
Maybe even insulting.
We'll sell more magazines.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.933
- Yeah, hey, I'll crank it up!
- 'Yeah.'

13:10.000 --> 13:11.633
Pour on the heat.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.266
I am red and hot.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.600
I knew we had the same aura.

13:15.666 --> 13:18.733
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- 'What?'

13:18.800 --> 13:21.533
I said how about that?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.066
Listen, I gotta go.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.933
Yeah, go, go, go, go!

13:32.666 --> 13:35.366
Okay, let's rock 'n' roll,
shall we?

13:35.433 --> 13:38.000
You know, these teeth
don't fit so well.

13:38.066 --> 13:41.300
- Oh, leave it.
- Yeah, we'll make it work.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.633
Yeah, a little jet-lagged
from my gig in the&lt;i

13:43.700 --> 13:45.433
so if I nod off, just nudge me.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.566
Okay.

13:46.633 --> 13:49.733
Umm, Kiki, I want you
to grab this wooden stake

13:49.800 --> 13:51.600
and hold it above you.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.066
And I want you to hold it as
though someone is trying to

13:54.133 --> 13:55.633
drive it in, you know.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.166
And I want you to fight with it.

13:58.233 --> 14:01.066
Okay, you want
erotic, weird, sick

14:01.133 --> 14:02.800
funny, goofy, I'm up for it.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.800
Uh, how about, uh, racky?

14:07.900 --> 14:09.833
Yeah, cool.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.400
'Hey, I can see that.'

14:11.466 --> 14:13.000
So, you want me to
lick the stick?

14:13.066 --> 14:14.900
Or I could suck
on it if you want.

14:14.966 --> 14:16.566
'Uh, no, no, no, no.'

14:16.633 --> 14:18.800
I think just fight
with it for now.

14:18.866 --> 14:21.300
Maybe we'll, uh, lick later.

14:21.366 --> 14:23.000
Oh! Oh, no.

14:23.066 --> 14:26.366
Oliver, uh, would go out

14:26.433 --> 14:28.733
and get some fog juice please?

14:28.800 --> 14:31.133
You got it.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.600
Hey, you just relax and, uh,
I'm gonna change some lenses.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.533
Hey, babe!

14:58.600 --> 15:00.866
Stakes get to impale hearts.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.933
Get him off of me!

15:03.000 --> 15:04.133
Oh, Ki..

15:04.200 --> 15:05.500
Hey, that's great!

15:05.566 --> 15:07.166
Keep doing that, really..

15:07.233 --> 15:08.900
Get him off me!

15:08.966 --> 15:10.400
Get him off..

15:13.900 --> 15:16.800
I heard you was
dying for this job.

15:25.766 --> 15:27.000
Nice touch, Kiki, that's it.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.000
Shudder like you're dying
and you're fighting it.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.766
That nails it.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.133
You just relax,
I'm gonna knock these off.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.866
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.100
Super rush.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.700
Get these prints
off to Torrie's, right away.

16:00.766 --> 16:02.900
Flying out.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.366
Well, we're about through here.

16:11.433 --> 16:12.700
This is your nudge.

16:12.766 --> 16:16.166
Here, I'll take this.
You can let go.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.200
Oh, my God!

16:20.733 --> 16:22.666
Oh, my God!

16:22.733 --> 16:25.333
This can't be.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.733
Well, she's dead.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.100
Oh, Oliver!

16:31.300 --> 16:33.466
Oh!

16:33.533 --> 16:34.700
Wait a minute.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.066
This can't be.

16:36.133 --> 16:39.800
Uh, alright,
pull yourself together.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.700
Uh, police.

16:43.766 --> 16:46.666
Urgh, I-I can't call the police.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.200
They're gonna think I did it.
I-I'm alone here.

16:50.266 --> 16:53.133
Okay, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.900
My prints are on the stake.

16:55.966 --> 16:57.166
And I s..

16:57.233 --> 17:00.300
Stake is in the photos,
I sent the photos out.

17:00.366 --> 17:02.433
Okay!

17:02.500 --> 17:04.400
Wait, I just need time.

17:04.466 --> 17:06.433
I need time to think.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.633
I know what I'll do.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.166
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.800
I'll stash the body.

17:35.566 --> 17:38.933
There must be something.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.933
Something, I missed.

18:00.366 --> 18:02.200
Who the hell are you?

18:02.266 --> 18:04.600
'Your meal ticket.'

18:07.333 --> 18:08.366
Where are you?

18:08.433 --> 18:10.100
'In your head, dummy.'

18:10.166 --> 18:12.100
No!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.233
In-in my dream?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.133
'We've been working together.'

18:17.200 --> 18:20.200
'I told you the babes!'

18:20.266 --> 18:22.533
You killed, Kiki?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.200
'You lost your touch.'

18:24.266 --> 18:25.466
'I got it back.'

18:25.533 --> 18:28.166
'No me, no photo'

18:28.233 --> 18:30.066
'no job!'

18:30.133 --> 18:32.933
Oh, stop! Stop!

18:33.000 --> 18:35.900
Stop it! Stop!

18:37.700 --> 18:39.566
How did you do that?

18:39.633 --> 18:41.166
'You wanted real?'

18:41.233 --> 18:44.100
'I'm a dream come true.'

18:45.233 --> 18:48.566
- Dre-dreams?
- 'Umm-hmm.'

18:48.633 --> 18:50.766
'They just gotta nod off.'

18:50.833 --> 18:52.800
'That's the picture.'

19:10.500 --> 19:11.566
Yes?

19:11.633 --> 19:12.800
'This stuff is great.'

19:12.866 --> 19:14.766
'Cutting edge all the way.
It vibrates.'

19:14.833 --> 19:16.100
'Give me one more set.'

19:16.166 --> 19:20.200
No, no, I,
I can't do the last one.

19:20.266 --> 19:23.733
You'll, uh, you'll have
to make it work with two.

19:25.266 --> 19:27.200
'Maybe they did
that in your day.'

19:27.266 --> 19:29.066
'It's all or nothing with me.'

19:29.133 --> 19:32.100
'I need one more session or
it's back to portraits for you.'

19:35.166 --> 19:37.100
Uh..

19:39.066 --> 19:40.166
Okay.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.700
I'll do it.

19:42.766 --> 19:45.766
I'll do it. I'll do it.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.033
'Good.
So, get on it.'

20:13.400 --> 20:17.266
'So why such a late session?'

20:17.333 --> 20:18.700
Deadline.

20:18.766 --> 20:20.133
'I hear you.'

20:20.200 --> 20:23.366
I'm trying to do a leverage
stock buyout before it splits.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.300
I got an inside tip.

20:25.366 --> 20:28.200
Then I could plan 30 thou
to revolving CD and that will

20:28.266 --> 20:31.200
compound bi-quarterly.

20:31.266 --> 20:33.566
'So, what do you
do with your money?'

20:33.633 --> 20:34.633
Spend it.

20:51.733 --> 20:55.766
So, what do you
want from the shoot?

20:55.833 --> 20:59.433
I'd like to capture
Cleopatra in repose.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.033
The Egyptian sleeping beauty.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.833
So, if you could just
nod off, that would be great.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.866
You mean, I can sleep.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.300
That would do it.

21:11.366 --> 21:18.100
Oh, not hard at this hour.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.300
Get paid for sleeping.

21:21.366 --> 21:23.400
Not bad.

22:11.966 --> 22:14.300
Do something.

22:14.366 --> 22:20.933
Excuse me?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Get away from him.

22:23.066 --> 22:25.633
I don't understand.
From whom?

22:25.700 --> 22:30.933
Right behind you.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.800
Ah! I'm sorry.
I don't know what you want.

22:36.866 --> 22:38.800
Who?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.433
So, you want to make her scream?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.600
Yes.

22:49.666 --> 22:50.733
This should do it.

23:16.066 --> 23:18.566
Heh-heh,
it is totally, boss, awesome.

23:18.633 --> 23:19.666
What can I say?

23:19.733 --> 23:22.266
You are going to be
very big, very,

23:22.333 --> 23:23.700
'and I want
an exclusive on you.'

23:23.766 --> 23:25.800
You are gonna shoot
for "Kink" only.

23:25.866 --> 23:29.200
Call me, just as soon
as you see the magazine.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.700
Right. As soon as I see it.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.300
Messed her up bad.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.033
Well, all in a day's work.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.100
She wanted it, didn't she?

23:55.266 --> 23:57.400
Be careful what you wish for.

23:57.466 --> 23:59.400
You might just get it.

23:59.466 --> 24:01.533
And get it good.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.433
I'm sorry..

24:50.500 --> 24:52.833
...Halloween
isn't until tomorrow night.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.033
We just don't give
out candy till then.

25:42.233 --> 25:46.133
It's Halloween,
my night to play.

25:48.966 --> 25:52.566
I, uh,
I asked them to hang around.

25:52.633 --> 25:55.700
I hear that,
feds are coming to Springwood.

25:55.766 --> 25:59.866
Those out-of-towners,
they've got such a bad attitude.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.333
Wait till I show 'em,
a couple of my tricks or treats.

26:24.133 --> 26:26.100
This is number 48, Dennis.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.633
That many?

26:27.700 --> 26:28.933
What's that make us?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.033
Thirty and seventeen
versus the bad guy.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.900
He's not bad.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.566
Should always
check with the hotshot.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.333
Bureau thinks he's good.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.100
Peterson caught the iceman
and they covered him.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.133
So, all that's one.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.933
You just said, we got 30.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
This guy is, he's weird.

26:43.066 --> 26:44.233
It's kind of unhinged.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.400
Probably why he's good.

26:45.466 --> 26:46.733
Gives me the creeps, Jack.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, but he's in-charge.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.033
Thanks a lot,
we'll take it from here.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.600
And the door was left open.

26:53.666 --> 26:55.000
Why did you do that?

26:55.066 --> 26:56.466
We just got here.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.233
You want everyone to see this?

26:58.300 --> 26:59.433
Proud of it?

26:59.500 --> 27:02.633
Didn't think you'd get caught?
Why is that?

27:02.700 --> 27:03.966
You talking to yourself?

27:04.033 --> 27:05.833
- Yeah.
- Does this go on all day?

27:05.900 --> 27:07.300
Maybe I don't know yet.

27:07.366 --> 27:09.300
Think you can handle it?

27:09.366 --> 27:12.600
Look, we're here because
the bureau says, "go".

27:12.666 --> 27:14.466
Then they say,
some new guy

27:14.533 --> 27:15.800
is gonna run our ticket
on this one.

27:15.866 --> 27:18.033
You walk in and you
start talking to yourself.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.200
It's just not the way
we work, that's all.

27:20.266 --> 27:23.333
And does this
look normal to you?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.666
All the weirdoes
come out on Halloween.

27:25.733 --> 27:26.766
The bureau thinks
they might have

27:26.833 --> 27:28.766
a serial killer
on this like Missouri.

27:28.833 --> 27:31.266
A loose wacko
wasting families.

27:31.333 --> 27:34.300
That's why we took over
from the local authorities

27:34.366 --> 27:35.666
Now, you guys
are by the book.

27:35.733 --> 27:38.500
Step in time, tell the wine,
that's okay.

27:38.566 --> 27:40.566
- Just doesn't work for me.
- Yeah?

27:40.633 --> 27:42.833
What's your bag?

27:42.900 --> 27:47.366
I gotta, I gotta get
the mindset of what did this.

27:47.433 --> 27:53.966
Suck up the facts
and some kind of feelings I get.

27:54.033 --> 27:57.366
That's great.
Really.

27:57.433 --> 28:00.733
You grab your feelings
and we'll grab this.

28:17.733 --> 28:19.700
Well, look at this.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.466
Is this
in the prelim report?

28:24.533 --> 28:26.033
No, not covered.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.466
I better dust it.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.566
Let's see if we get
any feelings from it first.

28:32.766 --> 28:36.333
Both the parents
were found downstairs.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.100
Mrs. Johnson met you
at the front door.

28:39.166 --> 28:42.033
You shut her
up fast, two bullets.

28:42.100 --> 28:45.400
Why did you use the silencer?

28:45.466 --> 28:48.033
The daughter was found upstairs.

28:48.100 --> 28:53.333
The silencer allowed you to get
upstairs without being heard?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.700
Father was found downstairs.

28:55.766 --> 28:57.733
Sitting in the chair
with his throat cut.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.166
The bodies are at the morgue.

28:59.233 --> 29:01.900
Maybe you'd like
to talk to them later.

29:01.966 --> 29:04.000
Later.

29:04.066 --> 29:07.233
Did he come in later?
Did he finds you?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.433
Why didn't you shoot him?

29:09.500 --> 29:12.233
Was it too easy?

29:12.300 --> 29:16.166
Playing games here,
having fun?

29:16.233 --> 29:18.333
The father's blood is in a
circular ring around the chair.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.400
How?

29:20.466 --> 29:22.633
You spun the chair,
didn't you, son of a bitch

29:22.700 --> 29:25.400
He thought it was funny.

29:25.466 --> 29:27.466
Our boy's got sense of humor.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.333
Just got that feeling, huh?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.966
You said, you suck up facts.

29:32.033 --> 29:33.800
You got any?

29:33.866 --> 29:37.033
- One of the lights.
- What about the lights?

29:37.100 --> 29:41.533
Broken bulbs,
lamps, something disturbed.

29:41.600 --> 29:46.966
What about the three people?
They got disturbed in a big way.

29:47.033 --> 29:51.233
No sign of struggle,
but the lights are broken.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.766
You didn't want to be seen
Or you just like it dark?

29:53.833 --> 29:56.000
What does this have
to do with anything?

29:56.066 --> 29:57.566
Don't know yet.

29:57.633 --> 29:59.466
So, all you do know is,
we're looking for some funny guy

29:59.533 --> 30:01.566
who likes to break lights.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.666
I'd like to get
home before Christmas.

30:03.733 --> 30:05.733
Have any feelings about that?

30:08.366 --> 30:10.966
'Debbie honey, it's me mom.'

30:11.033 --> 30:13.800
'I'll be a little late,
could you start the turkey?'

30:13.866 --> 30:18.166
'Set the oven for 350.
Put it on the lower shelf.'

30:18.233 --> 30:20.166
'Thanks, dear.'

30:20.233 --> 30:23.533
'Hi, honey. It's me.
I'll be home in..'

30:23.600 --> 30:29.600
'Hello? It's you again.
Who the hell are you?'

30:29.666 --> 30:31.400
'What the hell
are you doing in my house?'

30:31.466 --> 30:36.566
'On my phone? Get out!
Get out! Get out!'

30:36.633 --> 30:39.133
- Is that the father?
- Sounds like it.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.700
I think he's talking to the guy.

30:40.766 --> 30:41.933
That's the killer.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Where's the other voice?

30:43.066 --> 30:44.033
Why didn't it record
the other voice?

30:44.100 --> 30:45.266
I don't know.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.833
- There should be another voice.
- Maybe he's like you.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.433
Talks to himself.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.933
Hey, trick or treat, come on in.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.533
Hey, what the hell? This isn't
really evidence anyway, is it?

31:01.600 --> 31:04.400
Not to me.
Hey, Peterson?

31:04.466 --> 31:06.933
You wanna feel this stuff
or rub it all over your body

31:07.000 --> 31:08.933
or whatever is it that you do?

31:12.633 --> 31:14.933
- Something I said?
- Here, you go, kids.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.766
'You wore a sheet..'

31:21.833 --> 31:25.166
The bullet holes
were exit holes.

31:25.233 --> 31:26.600
But the sheet
wasn't just a gag

31:26.666 --> 31:27.800
you didn't wanna be recognized.

31:27.866 --> 31:30.533
That's how you
got into the house.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.633
But then you dropped the
sheet in the hall right here.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.800
So, the girl saw you.

31:37.866 --> 31:42.200
And you got the girl
at pretty close range.

31:42.266 --> 31:45.566
Was she too scared to run?

31:45.633 --> 31:47.600
Did she know you?

31:50.066 --> 31:51.933
Why'd you take the sheet off?

32:09.266 --> 32:10.900
Look at me you, son of a bitch.

32:10.966 --> 32:11.933
Daddy?

32:15.366 --> 32:17.800
Hey, whoa! Easy.

32:17.866 --> 32:20.066
'What the hell
are you doing? You crazy?'

32:20.133 --> 32:22.100
'Never pull a piece on me.'

32:22.166 --> 32:26.466
I'm sorry, uh..

32:26.533 --> 32:28.466
What the hell
were you staring at in here?

32:28.533 --> 32:32.800
We came here to check it out.
You were really zoned out.

32:32.866 --> 32:35.000
It was the father?

32:35.066 --> 32:37.300
In here?

32:37.366 --> 32:38.600
He killed them.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.333
How do you know that?

32:41.400 --> 32:43.366
I don't know.

33:02.866 --> 33:05.966
Well, at least we got
a starting point, the father.

33:06.033 --> 33:07.833
Maybe you do.
We got work to do.

33:07.900 --> 33:08.866
Real work.

33:08.933 --> 33:10.733
Hey, things are
getting good here, guys.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.233
Oh, we're happy for you.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.133
Look, I know,
I'm right about this.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.133
I don't expect you to believe me
at first, not right away

33:19.200 --> 33:21.133
but just don't rule it out.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.066
I've never had feelings
from some sort of dreams.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.266
It's like I could see the
whole thing happening again.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.866
It's always been from facts
before, this is different.

33:30.933 --> 33:32.900
Damn right. This is nuts.

33:32.966 --> 33:34.633
Where'd you learn
to think like this?

33:34.700 --> 33:35.900
Prison.

33:35.966 --> 33:38.233
- 'You serious?'
- 'Yeah.'

33:38.300 --> 33:40.866
If you were in prison,
how did you get in the bureau?

33:40.933 --> 33:42.766
I'm not.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.233
- 'But I thought--'
- You thought wrong.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.566
What were you in for?

33:45.633 --> 33:47.666
Research.

33:47.733 --> 33:49.666
I was there to learn.

33:49.733 --> 33:51.666
Bureau paid me.

33:51.733 --> 33:53.433
I work freelance.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.133
They liked me, but I just
didn't quite fit the mold, so..

33:56.200 --> 33:58.866
You were at the prison,
'cause you wanted to.

33:58.933 --> 34:00.566
I thought, it'd be interesting.

34:00.633 --> 34:03.866
You see, the cons are in there
'cause they don't think like us.

34:03.933 --> 34:05.866
Or do they?

34:05.933 --> 34:08.333
That's why I had to find out.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.166
After two years,
I got a feel for them.

34:10.233 --> 34:12.100
You'll spent two years
in the joint?

34:12.166 --> 34:13.700
Just for research?

34:13.766 --> 34:15.700
Gotta sleep somewhere.

34:17.033 --> 34:18.366
I don't like this guy.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.833
Ah, maybe he'll figure all this
out, we'll get outta here early.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.300
Yeah, and maybe he won't.

34:22.366 --> 34:23.833
And then we'll be stuck here
with him.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.066
Are you telling us the father
killed his wife and daughter

34:37.133 --> 34:39.000
and then slit his own throat?

34:39.066 --> 34:42.033
The cut was laterally left to
right across the carotid artery.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.433
With a wide sweeping motion.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.533
Yeah, and the father
was right handed.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.933
There was no weapon found.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.266
Which tells us the father
couldn't have killed himself.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.433
You don't slit your own throat
and then hide the weapon.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.433
I know that.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.033
I just said, he killed his wife
and his daughter.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.966
Great! So who killed him?

34:59.033 --> 35:02.233
I don't know that yet.
Do you?

35:02.300 --> 35:04.966
Why are we even having
this conversation?

35:05.033 --> 35:07.333
I don't know how to respon
to this guy.

35:09.066 --> 35:11.266
You got a problem
with this, Jack?

35:11.333 --> 35:12.866
I trained under Hoover.

35:12.933 --> 35:16.600
The man was not
big on feelings.

35:16.666 --> 35:19.000
So what happened to you?

35:19.066 --> 35:21.266
You killed your own daughter
and you came downstairs

35:21.333 --> 35:24.333
but why didn't you leave?

35:24.400 --> 35:25.900
Why did you stop?

35:25.966 --> 35:29.566
Why did you sit down?

35:29.633 --> 35:30.966
There we go again.

35:31.033 --> 35:33.333
Were you figuring out a plan?

35:33.400 --> 35:35.366
You've been wingin' it
up till now?

35:35.433 --> 35:38.566
Hey, maybe he didn't really
know what he'd done.

35:38.633 --> 35:40.400
Are you buying
into this free brain crap?

35:40.466 --> 35:42.433
- Ah, it's just a thought.
- It's not a bad one at that.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.966
Jack, just remember
who you work for.

35:45.033 --> 35:49.266
Are you in shock,
and you collapsed in the chair?

35:49.333 --> 35:51.300
But how did you die?

35:55.366 --> 35:56.500
- I saw something.
- 'What?'

35:56.566 --> 35:57.666
- A man.
- Where?

35:57.733 --> 35:59.566
- In here.
- Where else?

35:59.633 --> 36:00.700
We're supposed to be working

36:00.766 --> 36:03.266
and you're jumping around
like a maniac.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.033
You know, you're crazy enough
to have done all this yourself.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.033
Except I was in Pittsburg
at the time, where were you?

36:08.100 --> 36:10.800
Washington. Where I've got
20 years with the Bureau.

36:10.866 --> 36:12.466
In the field,
not in some prison.

36:12.533 --> 36:14.933
Which is why I hope
I can count on you.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.600
Now if this interrogation
is over

36:16.666 --> 36:18.633
I'd like to get back to work.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.500
Why don't we enact
the crime scene?

36:21.566 --> 36:24.766
Jack, you play the mother and,
Dennis, you're the daughter.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.966
Should we wear dresses?

36:27.033 --> 36:29.400
Just asking.
I wanna do this right.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.366
Give me a minute.

36:32.433 --> 36:34.400
Take your time.

36:38.233 --> 36:40.533
'Should we wait
for this report?'

36:44.066 --> 36:47.166
I'll get it.

36:47.233 --> 36:50.333
Sorry, Halloween's not till
tomorrow night.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.600
No, candy till then.

37:06.566 --> 37:08.833
Look at me, Freddy.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.833
You talking to me?

37:10.900 --> 37:11.966
Son of a bitch!

37:27.033 --> 37:29.000
Oh my God!

37:34.733 --> 37:40.300
What has happened to me?

37:50.066 --> 37:52.033
Krueger?

37:58.300 --> 38:02.000
'What the hell are you doing?'

38:02.066 --> 38:05.200
The guy in a green sweater,
a Halloween mask and a hat

38:05.266 --> 38:07.500
with the father..

38:07.566 --> 38:09.533
Right in this chair.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.033
Yeah, it's Peterson,
listen, uh

38:23.100 --> 38:25.433
I need you to run
a check on Freddy Krueger.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.433
Gimme everything you got.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.700
Yeah, the works, great.
Thanks.

38:31.566 --> 38:32.633
That was Washington,
they're gonna run

38:32.700 --> 38:35.100
a computer check
on Freddy Krueger.

38:35.166 --> 38:37.033
Where'd you get this name,
Freddy Krueger?

38:37.100 --> 38:38.433
He's not in the case file.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.333
There is nothing around the
house with his name on it.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.466
Oh, I kinda heard it.

38:42.533 --> 38:44.500
You heard someone say
"Freddy Krueger"?

38:44.566 --> 38:46.000
There's no one else here, right?

38:46.066 --> 38:47.033
Right.

38:47.100 --> 38:51.200
Oh, so this was in your dream.

38:51.266 --> 38:53.266
Yeah.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.500
I know, it was just
in the dream

38:55.566 --> 38:58.000
but I know
that's the name.

38:58.066 --> 39:01.633
I can't wait to see, how you're
gonna file this on the report.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.466
Sure wasn't any form
to cover this.

39:03.533 --> 39:06.300
Thought you heard it,
but in a dream.

39:06.366 --> 39:07.966
But you know it.

39:08.033 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, that'll
hold up in court.

39:11.366 --> 39:13.433
What about those slash marks
on that lamp shade, pal?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.300
'Forensics didn't have
an answer for that.'

39:17.366 --> 39:20.233
But the bladed glove that
I described would cover it.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.100
And that was in the dream.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.200
And those slash marks, sure
as hell are on that lamp shade.

39:29.633 --> 39:31.933
Well, the marks&nbsp;
areon the lampshade.

39:34.466 --> 39:36.400
Maybe we should
cut him some slack.

39:36.466 --> 39:38.033
He covertly
brought down the iceman

39:38.100 --> 39:40.033
with clues that
everyone missed.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.066
No, something's wrong here

39:44.133 --> 39:45.966
Like what?
Like he's making stuff up?

39:46.033 --> 39:48.033
Maybe, maybe not.

39:49.866 --> 39:52.766
How do we know the Bureau
placed him in prison?

39:52.833 --> 39:55.400
Well, they've done it before.
What are you getting at?

39:55.466 --> 39:56.433
Well, how the hell
does he know

39:56.500 --> 39:58.766
all this stuff
that went on here?

39:58.833 --> 40:00.866
Well, he doesn't
if he's just making it up.

40:00.933 --> 40:03.666
And if he's not?
Then the only way he'd kno

40:03.733 --> 40:05.866
is if he was here.

40:05.933 --> 40:07.266
I think he may be
one of the people

40:07.333 --> 40:09.533
he claims
he was researching.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.800
- Identity transference.
- Yeah.

40:11.866 --> 40:14.166
We don't really know
if he's from Pittsburg.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.333
And what's with
all this dream crap?

40:18.400 --> 40:20.433
I think we may have a wack
right here in the house.

40:21.266 --> 40:22.866
Like that guy in Boston in '81.

40:22.933 --> 40:24.166
The one on the police force.

40:24.233 --> 40:26.200
Yeah.Investigating
the murder he committed.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.866
But we got no proof on Peterson.

40:29.933 --> 40:32.266
I'm gonna call Washington
on the car phone.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.300
Check out this
Freddy Krueger myself.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.833
Came down the hall,
after Freddy Krueger.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.733
You used the sheet to get the
drop on him at the front door.

40:50.266 --> 40:52.600
But then you didn't need it
anymore, when you got up here.

40:53.733 --> 40:55.733
So you tore it off.

40:57.633 --> 41:00.733
And you shot your daughter..

41:00.800 --> 41:02.900
...thinking
she was Freddy Krueger.

41:06.433 --> 41:08.433
Did you see it like I did?

41:10.166 --> 41:12.100
And Freddy was in your head.

41:13.733 --> 41:16.466
Somehow,
Freddy was in your head.

41:19.866 --> 41:22.100
He gets inside
by getting into your head.

41:22.166 --> 41:23.333
Don't open the door.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.333
It's only Dennis.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.633
'What is it?'

41:31.700 --> 41:35.433
Lesson number one.
Dreams can be real.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.100
And then you die.

41:39.166 --> 41:40.300
Hold it.

41:40.366 --> 41:42.466
It's not him Dennis.
It's Jack. It's Jack.

41:45.866 --> 41:48.300
'Dennis, Dennis.
Snap out of it.'

41:53.333 --> 41:55.900
I tried to tell you,
it was Jack.

41:55.966 --> 41:57.933
Krueger's just in your head.

41:59.233 --> 42:01.333
Washington said Freddy Krueger
is dead.

42:02.133 --> 42:04.133
Years ago.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.700
Trust me on this one.
Just put your gun away.

42:07.266 --> 42:09.200
Trust you?

42:14.833 --> 42:16.833
Jack's dead.

42:18.433 --> 42:20.400
Trust me.
Ha!

42:32.933 --> 42:34.633
Drop the gun, Dennis.

42:41.333 --> 42:42.433
It's not over.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.300
Come on, Krueger.
Let's have at it.

42:58.466 --> 43:00.500
You're not here.

43:04.433 --> 43:06.400
You're in here.

43:07.666 --> 43:09.600
You get inside their heads.

43:18.666 --> 43:20.700
Alright, Freddy..

43:22.800 --> 43:24.833
...let's get inside mine.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.966
Smart boy!

43:37.866 --> 43:39.333
But the game's gotta end.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.333
Ah!

43:46.233 --> 43:48.900
Urgh!

43:48.966 --> 43:51.200
Ruined a perfectly good sweater.

43:53.833 --> 43:55.900
Here, take it.

43:58.666 --> 44:00.533
It was you, on the phone machine
