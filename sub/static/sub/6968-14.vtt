WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:07.716
- All in favour.
- Aye.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.844
All right.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.640
Starting Monday...

00:14.723 --> 00:20.896
...the track around the athletic field will be
closed to joggers at 8.30pm instead of 10.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.276
Any other items before we call it a night?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.445
Yeah. Uh...

00:28.820 --> 00:32.073
I got wind that for the
spring drama production...

00:32.156 --> 00:37.162
...Howard Roberts intends to
put on Jesus Christ Superstar.

00:37.246 --> 00:40.958
You know how he is. Howard's just
trying to do things the kids like.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.585
My point exactly.

00:43.669 --> 00:48.340
I don't think that play is appropriate
for this high school.

00:48.423 --> 00:53.387
If he wants to be young, I have no
problems with Grease or Annie, or...

00:53.470 --> 00:57.599
- Doesn't Grease have the f-word?
- Look, I'll talk to Howard.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.938
Let's adjourn till next week. Deborah,
why don't you lead us in the prayer.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.733
- Jim, the game is on.
- It'll only take a minute.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.986
We've been letting it slip.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.324
Paul, why don't you get the door.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:26.128 --> 01:31.800
In the name of the lords of darkness,
rulers of the earth, kings of the underworld...

01:31.884 --> 01:36.680
...I command the forces of darkness
to bestow their infernal power upon me.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.557
(German)

01:44.980 --> 01:48.066
May the black powers of
our forefathers make us strong.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.820
Hail. Hail to the lords of darkness.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.949
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 14 - Die Hand Die Verletzt

02:48.961 --> 02:52.506
- How much further?
- It's just up here a ways.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.175
I heard the altar is a hollow stump.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.261
When they get freaked...

02:57.344 --> 02:59.471
...you get Kate. I take Andrea.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.391
Those mittens are givin' me a gingrich!

03:03.433 --> 03:05.519
This is it.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.862
OK, I need a personal object from everyone.

03:17.406 --> 03:21.994
All right. Now, Andrea,
you get to stand over here...

03:22.077 --> 03:26.039
...and face Jerry, like this.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.001
- Closer.
- Why like this?

03:29.626 --> 03:35.257
Well, that's so, uh... that's so that we're
calling the spirits up of every direction.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.260
Kate, you stand here and face me.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.014
Do you really think someone
used this place for black magic?

03:42.472 --> 03:45.058
- Come on, Dave!
- Shh.

03:46.018 --> 03:52.691
In the name of the lords of darkness, rulers
of the earth, kings of the underworld, rise.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.818
Rise to this place.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.654
Uh, Azazel.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.579
Know ye all who dwell in the light
of professed righteousness...

04:05.662 --> 04:10.834
...that the others who know the keys
and the angels have opened the gate.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.854
- Forget this!
- Andrea!

04:32.689 --> 04:36.193
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus!

04:36.276 --> 04:39.821
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death!

04:39.905 --> 04:42.199
Andrea! Wait!

04:51.041 --> 04:53.418
A hunter found him early this morning.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.129
Couldn't have been dead more than 12 hours.

04:56.213 --> 05:00.259
- They say this area is used by witches.
- "They"?

05:00.342 --> 05:04.012
Well, everybody around here
knows about the things that go on.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.223
They say people control things.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.060
Any evidence to substantiate
those rumours, Sheriff Oakes?

05:10.227 --> 05:14.106
Agent Scully, look at the body.
The eyes and heart have been cut out.

05:14.189 --> 05:17.484
Many homicides involve victim desecration.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.487
I know he and his friends
listen to devil music.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.364
"The Night Chicago Died"?

05:22.447 --> 05:26.410
You know what I mean.
Those heavy-metal bands that influence kids.

05:26.702 --> 05:30.956
Was Jerry Stevens ever witnessed
participating in witchcraft?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.458
- No.
- More rumours.

05:34.209 --> 05:38.505
This stump here is supposed
to be the ceremonial altar.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.091
What do you think?

05:41.425 --> 05:45.262
With turquoise chips, a picture of
John Wayne and three cans of shellac...

05:45.345 --> 05:48.348
...it'd make a pretty nice coffee table.

05:48.432 --> 05:53.020
You see all that wax?
Someone's been burning candles in there.

05:53.687 --> 05:58.108
- Any idea who Jerry Stevens was with?
- We assume he was alone.

05:58.525 --> 06:02.446
Most people don't set out to drink
two six-packs by themselves.

06:02.529 --> 06:08.076
I also found this. It has purple ink on the edge
like a library identification stamp.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.623
The end of the title says "in America".
I'm surprised you people overlooked it.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.918
I'm sorry, I... I gotta apologise here.
You're right.

06:16.001 --> 06:20.464
I admit, we're a little rattled here.
That's why I called the FBI.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.467
This may involve a deeper conspiracy.

06:24.134 --> 06:28.305
See, I grew up around here...
Ever since I was a kid I heard... stories.

06:29.014 --> 06:35.896
This is a weird area. It has a strange air
that I could chalk up to imagination...

06:35.979 --> 06:38.440
...till today.

06:38.524 --> 06:43.111
I'll have my staff start checking
libraries for you, Agent Scully.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.366
Better hide your Megadeth albums.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.661
Theories like that are why
I can't take him seriously.

06:50.744 --> 06:55.791
The homicide had a ceremonial presentation.
The manner in which the body was displayed.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.460
I got the impression you didn't believe him.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.547
I didn't want to incite
his aggravated imagination...

07:01.630 --> 07:05.384
...but there is a weird feel to this place.
Maybe there's truth in the rumours.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.845
I think he incited your imagination.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.974
I think it's nothing more than a murderer
taking advantage of local folklore.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.809
There's nothing odd about...

07:32.452 --> 07:33.912
So...

07:33.996 --> 07:37.916
- Lunch?
- Mulder, toads just fell from the sky!

07:39.209 --> 07:41.461
I guess their parachutes didn't open.

07:41.545 --> 07:45.299
You were saying something
about this place not feeling odd?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.183
CROWLEY HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY

08:02.191 --> 08:05.903
The weather service says there are
tornadoes in Massachusetts.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.615
The wind probably picked up
the animals into the storm.

08:11.158 --> 08:15.329
"Witch Hunt: A History
of the Occult in America."

08:15.621 --> 08:18.123
That's checked out to a Dave Duran.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.184
OK, people, may I have
your attention, please?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.730
Mr Kingery is out sick today,
so I'll be substituting.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.983
My name's Mrs Paddock.
I'm gonna take the roll.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.785
FBI. We'd like to speak with a Dave Duran.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.754
I'm not into that stuff at all, I swear.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.885
Jerry was my best friend.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.182
Look, I swear I've never
done anything like that.

09:17.266 --> 09:21.603
What made you go to a place
you heard was a witches' altar?

09:23.939 --> 09:26.108
We were just trying to get some.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.277
I told you.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.822
Why did you take the book?

09:32.614 --> 09:38.161
I don't know a thing about witchcraft, and we
wanted it to sound good. I never thought...

09:39.288 --> 09:41.415
You never thought what?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.292
That it would work.

09:43.375 --> 09:47.462
If you didn't kill Jerry Stevens,
why did you run away from us?

09:47.546 --> 09:49.631
I'm scared, man.

09:49.715 --> 09:54.011
- Of us?
- Of it. That ceremony.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.139
I'm afraid we called up
some devil or something.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.356
One of you killed Jerry Stevens.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.358
Who?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.113
He was displayed according
to the rites of Azazel.

10:13.197 --> 10:16.366
Who else would know about the ritual?

10:16.450 --> 10:19.286
- We stopped doing this because...
- I went out there.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.123
We were supposed to have a Mass.
No one else showed, so I left.

10:23.207 --> 10:27.044
- It wasn't any of us.
- Something is here.

10:27.127 --> 10:31.298
A presence amongst us... angry.
I can feel it.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.806
- You're letting them go?
- There's no evidence to warrant an arrest.

10:39.890 --> 10:44.770
- They never leave evidence.
- We heard how Jerry died. An occult ritual.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.440
- They've reached into our area from outside.
- "They" again.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.610
Those three kids are obviously
under a cult influence.

10:51.693 --> 10:55.447
They reach into our children,
in music, television, books.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.991
They prey on children's innocence.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.286
The FBI did a seven-year study...

11:01.370 --> 11:05.582
...and found no evidence of
the existence of occult conspiracies.

11:05.666 --> 11:10.087
And J Edgar Hoover never admitted
to the existence of the Mafia.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.382
If the murders attributed to
occult conspiracies were true...

11:13.465 --> 11:16.760
...it would mean thousands of people
killing tens of thousands...

11:16.844 --> 11:19.555
...without evidence, without being exposed.

11:19.638 --> 11:24.434
It would be the greatest criminal conspiracy
in the history of civilisation!

11:27.563 --> 11:30.858
Finally... you people understand
what we're up against.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.777
Our investigation is ongoing.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.413
Mulder, this is mass hysteria.

11:44.496 --> 11:49.209
And our presence here gives validity
to their fears of occult murders.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.547
- The water.
- What's wrong with it?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.675
It's going down the drain counterclockwise.

11:56.758 --> 12:01.221
Coriolis force in the northern hemisphere
dictates it should go down clockwise.

12:01.305 --> 12:05.058
- That isn't possible.
- Something is here, Scully.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.520
Something is making these things possible.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.948
Girls... may I have a word?

12:23.785 --> 12:27.414
I heard on the grapevine
about what happened.

12:27.497 --> 12:33.337
I know how hard it is to talk to adults,
even though you feel like you want to.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.798
Well, because you're young adults...

12:36.882 --> 12:41.220
What I'm trying to say is, if you feel
like talking, I'm here to listen, OK?

12:41.303 --> 12:44.181
- Thanks, Mrs Paddock.
- Hang in there.

13:18.757 --> 13:22.970
Your records indicate a high incidence
of students with depression...

13:23.053 --> 13:25.722
...headaches, eating disorders...

13:25.806 --> 13:31.019
This is high school. It's normal for students
to display abnormal behaviour.

13:31.103 --> 13:34.439
You're familiar with the indications
of repressed memory?

13:34.523 --> 13:37.776
A headache doesn't mean
a repressed memory.

13:37.860 --> 13:42.072
In your counselling, you've found
no evidence of past ritual abuse?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.241
None.

13:49.788 --> 13:54.751
Would it be possible for me to speak to
students who've had chronic complaints?

13:54.835 --> 13:59.673
That would be a betrayal of the
doctorlpatient relationship. Sorry.

14:06.722 --> 14:10.058
He was pretty quick to dismiss my concerns.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.186
Maybe there's nothing here.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.229
Or he's hiding something.

14:14.313 --> 14:18.650
Take a look at this.
I found this on the Internet.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.987
"The discovery of a mutilated
teenage boy in the forest...

14:22.070 --> 14:27.242
...has police distressed about the possibility
of an organisation of dark forces."

14:27.492 --> 14:29.912
Where's that from? The local paper?

14:29.995 --> 14:35.209
"The Jew is known to remove organs and
sacrifice teens in their religious ceremonies."

14:35.292 --> 14:39.213
It's taken from Völkischer Beobachter.
A Nazi newspaper in 1934.

14:39.296 --> 14:43.926
Same rumours, but the blanks have been
filled in with whoever is feared at the time.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.595
In this case it's occultists.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.265
Modern witches, known as Wiccan,
are a religion.

14:50.349 --> 14:54.144
They revere all life and nature.
They do not cast harmful spells.

14:54.228 --> 14:58.023
They don't worship Satan. The Church
of Satan renounced murder and torture.

14:58.106 --> 15:02.194
Their influence here wouldn't
account for the frogs or the water...

15:02.277 --> 15:04.655
...or, most importantly, the murder.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.032
Well, if not witches, then what?

15:07.741 --> 15:15.666
For your final exam, your grade will be based
on your diagram of a dissected pig embryo.

15:15.749 --> 15:20.212
These are actually hog embryos,
belonging to the order of the artiodactyl...

15:20.295 --> 15:26.510
...or creatures with hooves. Be sure to remove
the heart and lungs and draw diagrams.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
Be neat.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.351
Extra credit will be given
for dissecting the heart.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.106
You have until the end of the period.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.820
I'll cut it open, if you do the heart.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.155
OK.

16:21.523 --> 16:25.903
I've had this happen before. Some kids
just have trouble dissecting things.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.990
Shannon, I'm trying to reach your father
and get him to pick you up.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.992
No!

16:33.952 --> 16:36.580
- I'm sure he'll be here soon.
- No!

16:36.663 --> 16:39.458
- Shannon!
- Shannon, honey, come back!

16:40.250 --> 16:42.961
Shannon! You're remembering!

16:45.964 --> 16:48.467
Tell me what you remember.

16:50.302 --> 16:53.847
You, um... know who my stepdad is, right?

16:54.431 --> 16:57.142
Jim Ausbury on the PTC.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.105
All right, well...

17:02.648 --> 17:06.026
My mom, she's a teacher.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.988
Well... was a teacher.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.746
My real dad, he, um...

17:18.872 --> 17:21.375
He ran away.

17:23.210 --> 17:28.715
And... my mom met Jim at
some seminar or something.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.596
And they, um...

17:35.097 --> 17:37.683
...they got married.

17:39.726 --> 17:44.314
My sister and I moved up here
when I was about, um...

17:45.357 --> 17:47.442
...four.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.487
She was about two.

17:50.571 --> 17:54.116
Anyway, a couple of weeks ago...

17:54.741 --> 18:00.831
...my class, we took a field trip to what
they call the American Stonehenge.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.625
And...

18:04.418 --> 18:07.838
...I remember, when I was four years old...

18:12.509 --> 18:16.722
...Jim... took me in his car...

18:18.223 --> 18:21.351
...near there. And he, um...

18:25.063 --> 18:27.357
...he made me...

18:28.358 --> 18:30.235
...in the back seat.

18:30.819 --> 18:35.324
He told me that, if I ever told
anybody, he would hurt me.

18:35.741 --> 18:41.413
As he touched me, you know, I would
pretend like I was out of my body...

18:44.124 --> 18:48.003
...deep in the ocean, down with the fish...

18:49.588 --> 18:52.090
...in the dark water.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.387
Somehow I managed to
block out all these things.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.099
But... lately it's all been...

19:02.768 --> 19:05.270
I'm remembering, you know?

19:05.687 --> 19:08.190
The others, too.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.901
Others?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.736
Yeah.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.072
Men and women.

19:15.155 --> 19:20.452
They would, um, come to the house,
you know, when my mom was away.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.790
And they would take me
down to the basement.

19:24.873 --> 19:29.670
It was really dark. It was, like,
painted red with a dirt floor.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.508
They would wear these robes, black and red.

19:36.301 --> 19:40.055
And they would sing and they would chant.

19:40.681 --> 19:43.976
And then they would tie me and my sister up.

19:44.643 --> 19:49.690
These men and women,
they would make us do things.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.026
They called me a breeder.

19:56.697 --> 20:00.534
They would get me pregnant and
then they would kill the babies.

20:03.579 --> 20:08.041
I've had three children, and
they're all buried in the cellar.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.632
One night...

20:15.716 --> 20:19.553
...Jim murdered my sister for a sacrifice.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.266
She was only eight years old!

20:26.935 --> 20:30.856
He told everybody that
she'd died in an accident.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.026
Today brought it all back...

20:35.944 --> 20:39.406
...clear like it happened yesterday.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.496
Imagine if what she said is true.

20:46.580 --> 20:50.751
Why don't we just wait and see
what her parents have to say.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.890
Where's Shannon? They told me
you were bringing her home.

21:04.973 --> 21:09.728
She wanted to remain with friends.
Under the circumstances, we thought it best.

21:09.811 --> 21:14.149
Circumstances? Why wouldn't
she want to come home?

21:14.650 --> 21:21.281
Someone, or something, has obviously
put these things into her mind.

21:25.953 --> 21:30.290
Mrs Ausbury, perhaps
you'd like a glass of water?

21:30.374 --> 21:32.125
Yeah. Thank you.

21:32.543 --> 21:34.628
Mr Ausbury...

21:43.762 --> 21:49.852
Mrs Ausbury, your daughter has not accused
you of any involvement in these activities.

21:51.270 --> 21:56.191
Do you have any idea why Shannon
might have said these things?

21:56.275 --> 22:01.113
Jim and I have been having
marriage problems lately.

22:01.196 --> 22:07.035
We're committed to working them out. Maybe
we don't pay enough attention to Shannon.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.498
She and I don't...

22:13.000 --> 22:15.961
We don't get along. We fight.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.758
Have you ever known Shannon
to be pregnant?

22:21.842 --> 22:25.345
Of course not! She's fifteen years old!

22:25.929 --> 22:30.726
- How can you possibly believe...
- Have you ever had another child?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.648
A girl.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.067
Theresa.

22:39.151 --> 22:41.653
She died.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.323
At eight years old?

22:46.491 --> 22:49.077
Eight weeks...

22:49.161 --> 22:51.872
...with crib death.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.755
Did you do it?

23:05.010 --> 23:10.307
I would kill... anyone... who did
the things to her that she claims.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.901
Not a very Christian tenet.

23:22.528 --> 23:27.074
Thou, God of vengeance, shine forth!

23:28.867 --> 23:32.579
Even the devil can quote
scripture to fit his needs.

23:35.082 --> 23:38.335
How dare you! Get out of our house!

23:39.461 --> 23:44.341
As far as I know, you put those
ideas in my daughter's head.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.510
Now get out!

23:54.434 --> 23:57.604
The devil travels in many forms.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.190
And you may be one!

24:01.400 --> 24:06.196
Are you sure you're up to this, Shannon?
I heard about what you said.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.075
I'll be OK. I don't wanna miss the final.

24:10.158 --> 24:13.370
I'll be in my office, if you're feeling funny.

24:16.582 --> 24:22.171
You ought to remove your jewellery. You
wouldn't want to lose it in some pig's guts.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.965
I'll hold it until you're finished.

25:48.048 --> 25:53.262
I heard the chair and a crash and
I came running out of the office.

25:54.179 --> 25:57.307
Did you see anybody leaving the room?

25:57.724 --> 26:00.185
Did you hear the door open?

26:00.269 --> 26:05.107
I lock the doors after school
when I'm alone. I... I get afraid.

26:20.706 --> 26:23.792
I feel a dark angel is amongst us.

26:23.876 --> 26:26.378
It wants a sacrifice.

26:26.461 --> 26:29.506
It's been years since...
since we've done that.

26:29.590 --> 26:31.300
Exactly.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.136
Exactly. We haven't kept our faith.

26:34.553 --> 26:39.433
Are any of you...
responsible for my daughter?

26:40.976 --> 26:45.731
We all are. She was sacrificed for us.

26:46.607 --> 26:52.321
It's a portent. Shannon's death allows
us to get rid of the police, the FBI...

26:52.404 --> 26:55.199
It can all be blamed on her.

26:56.575 --> 27:01.580
Jim... you tell them she had
a thing for Jerry Stevens.

27:02.831 --> 27:05.626
She killed him out of jealousy.

27:05.709 --> 27:11.173
She cut out his eyes... because she couldn't
stand to have him look at another girl.

27:11.256 --> 27:15.594
And his heart... because she was heartbroken.

27:15.677 --> 27:22.851
But when they leave, and are gone, we must
rekindle our faith... rather than lose it.

27:42.913 --> 27:47.709
I never imagined she would hurt herself.
I'm old-fashioned, Agent Scully.

27:47.793 --> 27:54.716
I can't believe that children are capable
of such things as they are these days.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.056
She wanted me to hold that for her.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.188
Excuse me.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.652
Her office has a faint odour of incense.

28:13.735 --> 28:18.740
- She says it stops the smell of formaldehyde.
- It's also used in Black Mass rituals.

28:18.824 --> 28:21.660
I must admit, there are some
oddities to her story.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.620
What do you mean, "oddities"?

28:23.704 --> 28:28.000
The man she replaced has taken
two sick days in a 15-year career.

28:28.083 --> 28:33.172
The morning of Jerry Stevens' murder,
Mr Kingery developed necrotising fasciitis.

28:33.255 --> 28:37.176
- Flesh-eating bacteria? That's very rare.
- I know.

28:37.259 --> 28:42.389
And when I questioned the staff about Mrs
Paddock, no one can even recall hiring her.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.985
Oh, look, I'm even getting caught up in this.

28:55.068 --> 29:00.115
I'm sure Mrs Paddock's arrival and the
teacher's sickness is just a coincidence.

29:00.199 --> 29:03.202
The fact that no one recalls
hiring her is an oversight.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.662
This is something
we should get caught up in.

29:05.746 --> 29:09.791
I'll search the Ausbury house.
I've been told they're staying with friends.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.960
You check Mrs Paddock.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.840
Power's out.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.582
My religion...

30:31.665 --> 30:34.126
...my family, Agent Mulder...

30:34.209 --> 30:37.546
...goes back in this town seven generations.

30:39.298 --> 30:43.677
They fled persecution from
people being persecuted.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.346
All in the name of religion.

30:51.351 --> 30:56.440
I was raised to believe Christianity
was synonymous with hypocrisy.

30:56.523 --> 31:02.988
Man's natural tendency was to "do what
thou willst", not "do unto others".

31:05.157 --> 31:07.284
We believe...

31:08.785 --> 31:11.622
...man is nothing but an animal.

31:11.705 --> 31:16.543
No better, no worse, than those
that walk on four legs.

31:16.627 --> 31:21.381
And although I believed our faith
kept us powerful in the community -

31:21.465 --> 31:23.967
wealthy, good health -

31:26.553 --> 31:30.098
...I came to see hypocrisy in the others.

31:32.518 --> 31:35.103
In me.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.858
When they told me...

31:40.526 --> 31:45.864
...to blame my dead daughter...
for Jerry Stevens' death...

31:45.948 --> 31:48.492
...my reaction...

31:49.618 --> 31:54.206
I was sick... that they would
vilify an innocent...

31:56.375 --> 31:58.544
...someone I loved...

31:58.627 --> 32:01.547
...just to protect themselves.

32:01.630 --> 32:06.301
And, at that moment, I knew
I am better than an animal.

32:06.677 --> 32:11.139
That my... previous beliefs...

32:11.223 --> 32:15.435
...were responsible... for her
no longer being with us.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.065
And that it was time to talk to you.

32:44.923 --> 32:45.799
Clean.

32:58.687 --> 33:02.024
- Did you abuse Shannon?
- Never sexually.

33:02.107 --> 33:04.193
And the rituals?

33:06.195 --> 33:09.907
The blood of the young is
considered very powerful.

33:09.990 --> 33:13.869
We'd include them in the ceremonies,
against their will.

33:14.494 --> 33:20.250
They were too young to be trusted not to talk,
but we never physically hurt them.

33:20.334 --> 33:23.921
We'd slip over the ancient rituals
that we didn't want to do.

33:24.004 --> 33:28.509
Like drinking grape juice
instead of wine at Communion?

33:32.179 --> 33:34.890
What about Shannon's memories?

33:36.683 --> 33:42.523
We'd perform a sort of posthypnotic
suggestion that repressed their memories.

33:42.606 --> 33:44.775
When they came of age - 18, 21-

33:44.858 --> 33:49.488
...then they were made aware of the religion
and brought into its practice.

33:49.571 --> 33:54.201
When she recalled the past events,
she must've mixed up reality with...

33:54.284 --> 33:58.247
...with that crap that's on Geraldo
and the tabloids.

33:58.330 --> 34:01.375
Did the others kill Jerry Stevens?

34:03.252 --> 34:05.504
Shannon?

34:06.088 --> 34:08.340
No.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.342
But you are responsible.

34:10.425 --> 34:14.638
You knew the possibilities contained in
your beliefs, no matter how watered down.

34:14.721 --> 34:18.600
Did you really think you could call up
the devil and ask him to behave?

34:28.944 --> 34:31.446
Who are the others?

34:36.743 --> 34:39.913
- Yeah?
- Mulder, the school. I'm in trouble.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.915
Scully?

34:43.667 --> 34:48.422
We've got an emergency.
I'm placing you under arrest.

34:49.464 --> 34:52.384
I'll be back for you later.

36:18.178 --> 36:19.471
Agh!

37:02.639 --> 37:04.850
- Scully?!
- Mulder, what's wrong?

37:04.933 --> 37:10.272
- You called. You said you were in trouble.
- No, I didn't touch the phone.

37:40.636 --> 37:45.390
Ausbury confessed to conspiracy. He'll name
everybody involved. Parents. Teachers.

37:45.474 --> 37:50.062
I checked on Mrs Paddock's background.
I don't think she's involved.

38:16.713 --> 38:18.799
My God!

38:19.174 --> 38:22.135
Do you think it's some kind of acid?

38:23.262 --> 38:28.016
There's no evidence of any reaction
with the wood from the acid.

38:28.725 --> 38:31.937
There are tracks in the dirt,
like from a snake.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.690
That's impossible.

38:34.773 --> 38:40.362
It would take a large python hours to
consume and weeks to digest a human being.

38:40.445 --> 38:43.490
You really do watch the Learning Channel.

38:48.704 --> 38:51.456
Scully... snakeskin.

38:54.418 --> 38:56.420
There's a python in Paddock's room.

38:58.172 --> 39:01.550
Sheriff Oakes called me. Jim Ausbury is dead.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.553
He was talking to the FBI.

39:06.388 --> 39:08.473
Did they kill him?

39:09.057 --> 39:11.059
You know who killed him.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.229
Ausbury was no believer.

39:14.313 --> 39:18.734
He had no real faith. No devotion.
He was punished for his doubts.

39:21.653 --> 39:24.156
We have to act...

39:24.239 --> 39:28.952
...or the same will happen to us,
if it's not already too late.

39:31.330 --> 39:34.416
We have to assume Jim
told them who we are.

39:36.585 --> 39:41.006
If Mulder knows, it will make the
offering all the more meaningful.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.935
They're here.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.651
Lock the office.

40:00.734 --> 40:04.655
My keys. They were in my pocket.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.383
Mulder...

40:25.175 --> 40:28.095
Mrs Paddock...? What happened?

40:28.262 --> 40:31.348
I... I came back. They were taking the snake.

40:32.182 --> 40:36.353
Mrs Brown, Mr Vitaris... there are
things about them I learned.

40:36.436 --> 40:40.858
- I think they killed that boy.
- We know about them.

40:40.941 --> 40:44.278
Conference room. It's all there.

40:44.361 --> 40:46.947
The paramedics must be
tied up by the storm.

40:47.030 --> 40:50.033
Just stay there, Mrs Paddock.
We're gonna lock the door.

40:52.035 --> 40:54.705
Just stay still. I'll be back.

42:28.715 --> 42:32.010
It'll make the blood easier to clean up.

42:39.643 --> 42:42.229
Dominus inferus vobiscum.

42:43.355 --> 42:45.440
Et cum tuo.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.746
Sursum corda.

43:12.676 --> 43:15.804
You're right. It is already too late.

43:24.938 --> 43:27.024
Oh, God!

43:27.691 --> 43:30.611
Mulder, did you see his expression?

43:31.028 --> 43:33.739
It was as if something had control of him.

43:33.822 --> 43:35.741
Paddock.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.204
Mrs Paddock?

43:48.086 --> 43:50.172
Mulder.

43:56.220 --> 44:04.228
Goodbye. It's been nice working with you.

44:36.868 --> 44:41.452
