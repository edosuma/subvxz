WEBVTT

00:20.654 --> 00:24.589
Hey, you want to slow down
a little bit?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.925
They're not slowing down.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.827
Well, I don't remember
these bumps

00:28.896 --> 00:30.161
hurting my ass so much.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.230
Your ass is fine, Bubba.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.334
All right, it says
make a right on Kearny.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.903
Yeah. Are you gonna
let some app tell us

00:37.971 --> 00:39.538
how to do a car chase?

00:39.606 --> 00:42.140
These things are really
pretty accurate, you know,

00:42.142 --> 00:44.610
if you just give 'em a cha...!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.588
What's going on up there?

00:56.657 --> 00:57.856
Don't say a word.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.958
Car 717, what's your 20?

01:00.027 --> 01:01.927
I don't like that face.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.228
This face?

01:03.296 --> 01:04.596
25 years working together,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.264
that face only means one thing:

01:06.333 --> 01:08.967
-trouble and paperwork.
-That's two things.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.536
Car 717...

01:10.604 --> 01:12.470
Oh, shut up!

01:12.539 --> 01:16.808
This goddamn rich kid pedophile,
Trevor Garrison,

01:16.877 --> 01:19.711
we've been after him
for six months.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.478
All right, come on.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.480
We gotta get this
wannabe gangster.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.616
You plan on outrunning both
of Garrison's cars on foot?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.618
They're in the same traffic
we are.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.554
-Oh, come...
-Come on, let's go.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.772
Oh, my gosh!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.641
What the hell's going on
up there?

01:49.643 --> 01:53.111
Gas truck took out a cable car.
We're blocked all the way...

01:53.180 --> 01:54.813
Oh!

01:54.882 --> 01:57.015
Dropped a hubcap, homes.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.388
Why don't you sit this one
out, Bubba.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.190
He almost shot me.
Where were you?

02:05.258 --> 02:07.459
It wasn't even close.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.701
Go! Let's go!

02:16.770 --> 02:18.804
Garrison!

02:27.514 --> 02:28.847
Let's go.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.387
Clear!

02:39.059 --> 02:41.593
Get out of there.
Get down!

02:42.495 --> 02:44.429
Freeze. SFPD.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.539
Joe! Joe, no.
The gas truck!

03:15.328 --> 03:18.630
My Uncle Ernesto has
a body shop.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.399
He can buff that out.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.289
There they are.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.559
Come on, knock it off.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.763
You degenerates will use
any excuse to end up here.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.799
We're the degenerates?
Boss, it's all over the news.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.635
-Hey, first round's on me.
-All right.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.903
I heard the 'Cuda got
pretty dinged up.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.472
-Four beers.
-Oh, dinged up you say?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.542
Well, the important thing is
we kicked ass

04:03.610 --> 04:04.743
and got the bad guy.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.144
How bad is it?

04:06.213 --> 04:08.446
We don't want to talk about it.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.148
Well, you know, if you don't
mind me asking,

04:10.217 --> 04:11.883
what the hell, boss?
We're a team.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.552
Why didn't you bring us along
for the takedown?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.388
Well, we were on our way
to pay a visit to Garrison.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.723
I guess somebody tipped him.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.425
He jackrabbited,
and so we had no time.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.726
You know, my guy downtown says

04:21.795 --> 04:24.229
you're in line
for a promotion. Big.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.798
Ooh, are you gonna
take us with you?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.400
What, are you crazy?
A man of my stature?

04:28.468 --> 04:29.901
I can't be seen with
lowlifes like you.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.870
Yeah, well, speaking of,
I forgot to tell you that

04:31.938 --> 04:33.938
the commissioner's office
called over to SIU.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.308
They want to see you
first thing in the morning.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.510
Hmm, I wonder what that
could be about.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.912
What it's about is
you two assholes are

04:40.914 --> 04:42.180
buying us drinks
the rest of the night.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.549
You got a deal.
B-man.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.419
Start a tab on me.
A round for the whole joint.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.923
One round. One.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.559
-Yeah!
-Shots, shots, shots, shots...

04:58.632 --> 05:00.431
Thank you.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.567
Hey, guys, a toast.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.369
When I came here from
Philadelphia,

05:04.371 --> 05:07.639
The City of Brotherly Love,
happiest place on earth...

05:07.708 --> 05:09.307
I thought that was Disneyland.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.977
My point is, when I got here,
I didn't expect to find,

05:13.046 --> 05:17.215
uh, I don't know... family.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.750
Oh, you're such a pussy.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.052
But as long as we're
making toasts,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.188
to Brenna Montrose.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.757
What happened to her,
that's on Garrison.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.158
And we got him.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.827
-We got him.
-Got him.

05:28.895 --> 05:32.431
: Inspector Bridges,
Captain Harris wants to see you.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.405
Suspended?

05:40.473 --> 05:41.440
I'm sorry, Nash.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.241
This couldn't wait
till tomorrow?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.676
You had to come down here...

05:44.744 --> 05:46.745
This'll be on the news
by tomorrow.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.880
I came down here as a friend.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.882
You were like a father to me
when me and Cassidy

05:50.884 --> 05:51.817
were going through Academy.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.052
Lena, this is some serious BS.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.987
You refused to communicate
with dispatch,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.556
and then you went out and you
blew up two city blocks.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.059
We got Trevor Garrison!

06:01.127 --> 06:03.594
He's been trafficking
in underage women.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.164
One 16-year-old girl is dead.
Come on!

06:06.166 --> 06:08.667
And you backdated your affidavit
for a search warrant.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.302
Exigent circumstances.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.437
You know I know where
the line is

06:12.505 --> 06:13.371
and when to stop.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.873
Garrison is getting a walk.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.776
And he'll probably
sue the city, too.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.279
All right, well...

06:21.348 --> 06:22.847
I'll take care of this myself.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.682
No, you leave it alone.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.852
You lay low,
you let me work on it.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.020
You'll be reinstated
in two weeks.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.291
A month tops.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.472
Hey, you know,
they just found another body

06:47.474 --> 06:48.807
up around Cow Palace?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.809
That's six in the last
three weeks, 11 total.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.410
It's gotta be a serial killer.

06:52.479 --> 06:53.879
But my podcast says

06:53.947 --> 06:55.847
there's no connection
between the killings.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.082
Bodies found all over the city,
killed in all kinds of mess...

06:58.151 --> 06:59.150
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.152
Man, if I have to hear about
your true crime podcast

07:01.221 --> 07:03.855
one more time...

07:03.924 --> 07:07.592
Hey, supercop.
What do you think?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.860
I'm not a cop anymore, Kenny.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.831
I'm a private citizen,
just like you.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.033
I'll tell you one thing,
I've seen a lot

07:15.101 --> 07:21.005
of serial killers, but this--
it's different.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.507
Come on, come on, come on.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.575
-Oh!
-Ha-ha!

07:23.643 --> 07:26.144
Hey, Kenny. Come here.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.113
Pull my limo to the alley
behind that bar.

07:29.182 --> 07:33.051
There's another 50 in it for you
if you get there in ten minutes.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.953
Sure thing, Nash.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.823
Today's gruesome discovery
brings the death toll to 11,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.591
in the seemingly
unrelated murders

07:39.659 --> 07:41.292
that have officials stumped.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.128
In a press conference today,
police captain Lena Harris

07:44.197 --> 07:46.998
indicated that there are
no suspects at this time.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.267
But Captain Harris promised
that SFPD will leave

07:49.336 --> 07:52.270
no stone unturned in bringing
down the killer

07:52.339 --> 07:55.273
or killers, leaving terrified
citizens to wonder,

07:55.342 --> 07:57.976
"Is there a serial killer
in our city?"

07:58.044 --> 07:59.611
Hold on.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.414
-It's my time.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.949
My time.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.419
Any chance of me getting in?
Feeling lucky tonight.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.290
-Just playing for fun,
Inspector.
-Ha.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.493
I'm not a cop anymore.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.828
Everybody's making that
mistake tonight.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.030
Whatever you are, get lost.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.633
I used to be a cop,
then I got stabbed in the back

08:21.701 --> 08:22.934
-by another cop.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.971
-Oh, come on, man.
-Figures.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.406
Now I'm just a part-time
limo driver,

08:28.475 --> 08:31.710
part-time
bail enforcement agent.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.180
You know, bounty hunter.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.916
Shame on you, Greg.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.786
You bounced on a $50,000 bond.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.729
-We good?
-Yeah, yeah, we're good.

08:51.798 --> 08:52.930
-We good?
-Good.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.300
-Come on, Greg, let's go.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.103
Don't piss yourself.
Oh, and you pissed yourself.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.139
Now you're gonna have to
ride in the trunk.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.308
Tell them we'll lower
the B round valuation

09:04.377 --> 09:07.078
to 80 million,
but the offer's only good if--

09:07.147 --> 09:09.280
You're too close
to the ledge, sweetie.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.415
I'm looking for starfish.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.084
There are no starfish.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.757
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.392
-Look.
-Oh, oh.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.383
I'm fishing here, Lena.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.785
You're bad luck.
Go away.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.220
You see my press conference?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.355
No.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.023
Wasn't pretty.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.292
The city's on tilt
with these murders.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.294
I got vigilante groups
on the streets,

09:56.296 --> 09:59.130
crackpots calling in
useless tips,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.533
all for the reward
on the Sunset Serial Killer.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.138
Come on, Nash,
I had to suspend you.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.408
You were a big problem downtown.
You pissed off a lot of people.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.744
Cowboy cop days are over.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.513
Well, they certainly are for me.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.482
You look like hell, you know.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.152
-You've always been a charmer,
you know that?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.421
Come on, I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.690
Yeah, sure. Why not?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.525
You chased off
all the damn fish.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.427
I've known you 30 years.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.396
-I've never seen you catch
a single fish.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.264
Thank you.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.335
What I have to say needs
to stay between us.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.438
Oh, you mean like that time
that you got my daughter drunk

10:40.506 --> 10:43.208
at the Academy, and then
drove the TI's golf cart

10:43.276 --> 10:44.409
into Metson Lake?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.545
Okay, first of all,
Cassidy got me drunk.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.780
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.548
And that was a very
long time ago.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.784
Oh, see, I haven't told anybody.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.053
All right,
so what's the big secret?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.423
Trevor Garrison is back in town.

10:58.491 --> 11:02.193
He just got back from
six months in the Ukraine.

11:02.195 --> 11:06.864
Well, maybe I'll just have
to pay him a little visit.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.367
Well, this is also
off the record.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.002
But your suspension?

11:11.070 --> 11:13.805
-It wasn't entirely...
-Oh, oh, the two-week suspension

11:13.807 --> 11:16.074
that happened a year ago?

11:16.142 --> 11:17.842
-That one?
-Listen,

11:17.910 --> 11:21.913
those people downtown who
hated you, they're gone now.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.082
I need you back.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.885
Maybe I'm happy
being off the force.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.553
You're a cop, Nash.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.090
That's all you'll ever be--
same as me.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.592
-I get to go after Garrison?
-No, I need you

11:34.661 --> 11:36.160
on the Sunset murders;

11:36.229 --> 11:38.229
you'll be back with
the Special Investigations Unit.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.433
With Steve Colton?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.702
That bozo that
stabbed me in the back

11:44.771 --> 11:46.137
and is now sitting there
in my job?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.940
That's about the size of it,
yeah.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.609
How does Steven feel
about this plan?

11:51.678 --> 11:53.812
I haven't told him yet.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.214
But he's gonna hate it.

12:04.490 --> 12:08.426
Listen, I understand whatever
feelings you're having.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.429
I really do,
and I want you to know that...

12:12.499 --> 12:16.401
I acknowledge them. Okay?
I think that's important.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.670
But if we're going to have
a meaningful dialogue here,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.739
I think we gotta start
from a place of respect.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.441
I mean, don't you agree?

12:24.377 --> 12:26.443
I'm handcuffed
to the table, man.

12:26.513 --> 12:30.215
Yeah, about that, I'm-I'm not
a big fan either, to be honest.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.982
In fact, I don't like
the word "accuse."

12:32.052 --> 12:34.218
I feel like it gets us off
on the wrong foot.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.188
If I confess, will you shut up?

12:38.190 --> 12:39.456
-Uh...

12:39.526 --> 12:41.759
Uh, yeah. Yes,
Dave, yeah, I will.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.362
Just give me one second, okay?

12:46.899 --> 12:49.267
Lena, hi. What, uh,
what brings you down here?

12:49.335 --> 12:51.936
Any chance I could ever get you
to call me Captain Harris?

12:52.004 --> 12:55.940
Ah, that title thing seems kind
of antiquated, don't you think?

12:56.008 --> 12:57.242
At SIU, we actually...

12:57.310 --> 12:58.142
I'm not with SIU.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.777
-I know.
-I oversee it.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.979
-Okay.
-And I gave you a shot
at running it.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.914
-And thank you.
-You know,

13:02.982 --> 13:04.448
I saw you
interrogate that skell.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.717
-You mean Dave?
-What are you guys,

13:06.786 --> 13:07.886
going to get beers later?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.487
No, I mean the criminal
who's been

13:09.489 --> 13:10.855
hitting electronic stores
for weeks.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.189
Allegedly.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.492
Anyway, listen,
that is not why I'm here.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.160
I'm putting SIU

13:16.228 --> 13:18.296
on the Sunset murders;
I've pulled it from Homicide.

13:18.364 --> 13:22.634
-That's great.
-And I am bringing in someone

13:22.702 --> 13:25.203
from the outside to help.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.438
Okay, who?

13:30.009 --> 13:32.810
Oh, no. No. No-no-no-no.
No, please. Please.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.112
Anyone but Bridges.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.980
I've put three
different divisions

13:36.048 --> 13:38.216
on these murders
and we're nowhere.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.751
I need SIU's technical abilities

13:40.820 --> 13:42.887
and Bridges knows this city
better than anyone.

13:42.955 --> 13:46.457
Yeah, he's also a loose cannon
who refuses to follow procedure.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.526
I don't care about
your issues with Bridges.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.162
There's a killer out there
and I need you both to nut up.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.333
Nut up?

14:11.651 --> 14:16.387
Well, my boss said he needed
me in Chicago, so here I am.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.860
I'll be back tomorrow.
I love you, too.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.276
First time?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.117
So how do you want
to start this?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.526
I think we just...

15:02.769 --> 15:03.801
Start.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.344
Place your bets,
place your bets.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.279
Four-to-five odds
on the handsome man.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.915
Who wins? Four to five.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.816
-Prop bets.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.317
Three to one on decapitation.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.953
40 to one
on both fighters dying.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.187
Still taking bets. Who wants in?

15:24.691 --> 15:28.993
Okay, ma'am. I've got
700,000 on gorgeous woman.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.895
Come on!
Come on!

15:50.116 --> 15:51.950
We need more action.
Now getting

15:52.018 --> 15:53.484
eight to five on gorgeous woman.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.631
You die, mother...

16:11.704 --> 16:13.171
Shit.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.107
-No good.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.909
-That's cheating!
-What the hell?

16:27.353 --> 16:28.753
No more bets.
No more bets

16:28.821 --> 16:30.054
-can be issued.
-Oh, shit.

17:05.591 --> 17:08.459
-No, sir. No, sir, no refunds.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.295
All bets are final.
All bets are final!

17:27.280 --> 17:30.814
You must be high.
Nobody shoots at me here.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.350
You know? I got businessmen
throwing money

17:33.419 --> 17:35.352
at me to buy weed.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.889
Why would I come
back to the SIU?

17:39.358 --> 17:40.291
'Cause I'm asking.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.992
That's good.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.396
Did you work on that a lot?
"'Cause I ask you."

17:45.398 --> 17:47.932
I'm not going to do it
without you, partner.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.067
I wouldn't even pass
the drug screen, man.

17:50.136 --> 17:53.370
-I'm high most of the time.
-And so am I.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.239
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.607
See you next week.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.542
Why don't you let me
worry about that.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.677
O-Okay.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.346
Uh, is the mayor
a weekly customer?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.181
Sometimes twice a week.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.550
They can't make me work
with him, they really can't.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.818
What is this really about?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.553
He didn't follow procedures.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.255
It was handed to me
to investigate.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.390
I-I reported what I found.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.525
Does that make me a rat?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.994
-Really?
-Mm, doesn't not make you a rat.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.730
-Okay.
-Let's talk about...

18:19.799 --> 18:22.232
Okay, if you say my father
again, I'm-I'm gonna go.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.235
I was gonna say "our father."

18:24.237 --> 18:25.903
Why don't you find
your own shrink

18:25.972 --> 18:28.339
and stop bugging your sister?

18:28.407 --> 18:29.840
I like bugging you.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.644
Bridges is in his 60s,
just like our father.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.714
Strong personality,
just like Dad.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.883
-Confident, bordering on cocky.
-Yeah.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.052
Classically handsome.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.955
What? That's not--
When did I...

18:44.023 --> 18:45.122
I googled him.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.958
Listen, it sounds like this
is going to happen,

18:47.026 --> 18:49.427
so you can either whine about it
or you can deal with it.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.464
A Hellcat?

18:53.532 --> 18:55.999
Órale, vato.
This is nice.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.336
Yeah, man,
I had to step up my game

18:58.338 --> 19:00.137
after you crushed the 'Cuda.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.773
Yeah, and getting the bad guys.

19:02.841 --> 19:06.010
You know, Joe,
we got hung out to dry.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.880
I don't feel like we
deserve to go out that way.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.949
Kind of feeling like we're
getting a second chance to

19:12.017 --> 19:15.018
go back in and see if we can
make a difference.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.188
What do you say,
the dream team back together?

19:17.190 --> 19:19.924
-One last assignment?
-Dream team?

19:19.926 --> 19:23.494
Yeah, I got your dream team.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.638
Very nice.
So when do I get to drive it?

19:34.706 --> 19:38.109
Uh, let me think. Um...

19:38.177 --> 19:39.476
Never.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.913
What? I'll give you free weed.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.582
Oh, we got a welcome committee.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.584
-Lena.
Bridges.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.319
Steven.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.055
Okay, this is
an unusual situation.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.256
Maybe we should go over
some protocols.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.359
Steven, you look exactly
the same, except for maybe

19:56.429 --> 19:58.128
you have a little more
gray hair, right?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.997
What? D-Don't.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.231
It's nice to see you, Joe.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.499
Lena.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.167
-Nice to see you.
-This is Joe Dominguez,

20:04.237 --> 20:06.336
-Nash's partner.
-Ah. Inspector Dominguez.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.306
I'm running SIU now,
so if there's, uh...

20:09.375 --> 20:11.341
any...

20:11.410 --> 20:13.611
I'm sorry, are you high?

20:13.679 --> 20:15.947
Well, right now?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.250
Joe's with us
on a consulting basis,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.552
so he doesn't have to
undergo drug testing.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.389
-Oh, but you do.
-Oh, I'm happy to take the test.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.524
In fact, I'll give you
my sample right now.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.628
Before this turns into
a literal dick-measuring moment,

20:30.696 --> 20:31.929
there's something
I need you to do.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.199
Yeah, I know.
See the department shrink.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.903
Make sure I don't have any
skulls in my basement.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.239
Yeah, we moved them out
to the backyard so...

20:42.308 --> 20:44.842
-Oh.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.713
I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't
investigate break-ins anymore.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.851
-Have a blessed day, ma'am.
What is that music?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.487
-Sounds like
my massage is ready.
-Uh, Joe?

20:56.555 --> 20:59.123
I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.292
I don't think we're
on Earth anymore.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.526
-Hey.
-Huh?

21:02.528 --> 21:03.494
One of my inspectors informed me

21:03.562 --> 21:04.929
you parked in my space.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.364
Wow, now that's some
solid detective work.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.066
Is it really anyone's space?

21:09.135 --> 21:11.168
I mean,
in a world with no titles,

21:11.236 --> 21:13.504
doesn't the space belong
to pretty much everyone?

21:13.572 --> 21:16.573
-Yeah.
-What's going on
over here, Steven?

21:16.642 --> 21:19.910
This is our IT hub.
Not only keeps us up to date

21:19.979 --> 21:21.445
with current crimes,
but allows us

21:21.514 --> 21:23.514
to predict how and when
future crimes may occur.

21:23.582 --> 21:27.818
Ah, predictive policing--
the new packaging for profiling.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.820
You run this?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.956
Oh, no.
No, only one person at SIU

21:32.024 --> 21:34.325
-really understands it.
-Hey, dickwad.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.895
Keep your feet off my CPU.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.964
Now, her I can work with.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.600
I'm Nash Bridges.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.903
Chloe Zane. We've met before.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.440
My uncle used to work here.
Nick Trevath.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.274
No-Neck Nick is your uncle?

21:51.344 --> 21:54.411
Oh, yeah, you used to come here
when you were a kid.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.380
-Yeah.
-You always wanted to
check out everyone's guns.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.015
I still like guns.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.117
Hey, let me ask you a question.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.685
There used to be
a coffee machine

22:01.753 --> 22:03.253
right over here--
where'd they move it?

22:03.255 --> 22:03.887
Gone.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.256
Steven brought in a cold press.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.325
Now we have green tea,
smoothies.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.796
Colon health.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.098
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.466
I got to get some real coffee.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.370
So where's Ellie Tang
and, uh, Philly Morton?

22:19.372 --> 22:22.072
-I don't see them.
-Working on a case.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.408
They're investigating
a bank robbery.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.912
There's something off
about that bank manager.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.314
Yeah, yeah, you see, uh,
his tan line?

22:30.382 --> 22:32.049
-Yeah.
-Where he used to wear a watch.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.517
Like he had to hock it recently.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.218
Oh! Keep doing that.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.154
He's wearing
an expensive suit but...

22:37.223 --> 22:39.422
it's falling apart
and did you...

22:39.492 --> 22:41.358
did you see that racing form
in the trash can?

22:41.426 --> 22:44.928
Degenerate gambler.
Maybe he set up the robbery.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.597
Yeah, I'll get a subpoena
for his financials.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.333
-Oh!
-Don't move! Oh!

23:00.413 --> 23:01.946
Nash is back.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.116
Coffee for Nash.
-Christina.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.351
Yeah, there you go.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.620
Nicely done. Wow.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.254
You gotta get the app.

23:11.324 --> 23:14.592
Yeah, I guess so.
You live around here?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.493
You want to know where I live?

23:16.495 --> 23:18.696
Oh, it's just
casual conversation.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.398
Just kind of running through
my coffee material.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.467
Oh, you have material.

23:24.904 --> 23:29.373
-Let me guess. Lawyer.
-Let me guess. Cop.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.043
Now, why would you think
something like that?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.346
Shoulder holster--
you're either a cop

23:35.414 --> 23:37.114
or you were there trying
to rob the trucks,

23:37.182 --> 23:39.116
and you don't seem
like a robber to me.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.452
-You sure?
-Yeah, I got a pretty good

23:41.454 --> 23:43.386
intuition about these sort
of things.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.189
Well, this is me.

23:46.191 --> 23:47.858
I had to bounce out
for some real coffee.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.262
Got some changes
going on in my office.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.063
This is me, too.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.667
You're a cop, that's how you
noticed the shoulder holster.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.903
I'm a psychiatrist.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.239
And this was going so well.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.844
I contract with SFPD
for psychiatric evaluations

24:06.912 --> 24:09.480
on certain cases like yours.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.982
Hmm. Joe.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.417
Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

24:14.419 --> 24:15.252
Oh, yes.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.087
Well, this is the SFPD shrink

24:17.156 --> 24:18.922
who wants to get inside
our heads.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.326
-Oh, dangerous place to be.
-Uh-huh.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.429
Anything else I need to
know about you, Doc?

24:26.665 --> 24:29.166
No, I think that's it for now.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.339
Oh, I've seen that look before.

24:35.407 --> 24:39.009
-What?
-Don't make a run
at the police shrink.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.513
Joe, it's 2021. You don't
"make a run" at women.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.781
-Well, you keep repeating that.
-Okay.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.250
Welcome back, bitches!

24:47.252 --> 24:50.453
Ellie, that's not really
an appropriate greeting.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.189
I said it with a "Z"
like bitchez.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.858
Yeah, I heard the "Z."
Come on.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.760
You really back, boss?

24:56.829 --> 24:59.162
-For now, Philly.
Okay, everyone.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.497
Yes, welcome back, Nash.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.800
Uh, the Sunset murders.
Chloe, can you?

25:03.869 --> 25:06.536
First two bodies were found
in the Sunset District,

25:06.538 --> 25:08.571
but all the bodies found had
been moved from somewhere else.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.041
We're still looking
for a common M.O.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.543
outside the extreme violence
with which

25:12.611 --> 25:13.343
the victims were killed.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.445
Now, I'm heading
to the districts

25:15.514 --> 25:16.914
that have been handling
the investigation

25:16.982 --> 25:18.249
to get their murder books.
Don't take

25:18.317 --> 25:21.084
any additional steps
till I get back. Got it?

25:21.153 --> 25:24.388
Oh, Dad, if I finish
my homework, can I watch TV?

25:24.456 --> 25:26.056
-Please?

25:26.125 --> 25:28.658
You don't technically work here.
Remember that.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.760
Ooh, okay.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.028
You guys ever gonna get past

25:31.096 --> 25:32.162
this Garrison beef?

25:32.231 --> 25:33.463
-What beef?
-Putting that aside,

25:33.465 --> 25:35.132
the fact that Trevor Garrison

25:35.134 --> 25:36.733
is up and walking around
is pretty screwed up.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.835
-I have a feeling the clock

25:38.904 --> 25:40.670
is ticking on Mr. Garrison.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.573
You guys, we got fresh bodies.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.008
-Huh?
-Pier 45.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.311
-You come with me.

25:48.814 --> 25:50.781
Comfy back there, Bubba?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.649
Well, I'm used
to riding shotgun.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.551
-You know?
-It's called chivalry.

25:54.619 --> 25:56.320
You're all right with that,
aren't you?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.789
If it gets me out of
having to squeeze back there.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.660
You don't mind my asking, but...

26:02.728 --> 26:04.962
beyond him being
a total lowlife,

26:05.030 --> 26:07.230
what's your beef with Garrison?

26:07.299 --> 26:09.066
How much do you know about him?

26:09.134 --> 26:11.301
Party boy.
Criminal wheeler-dealer.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.570
Drugs, weapons, whatever

26:13.638 --> 26:15.472
-he could make money on.
-Yeah, that's right.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.676
He also deals in influence,
surrounds himself with

26:18.744 --> 26:21.878
underage women, and deals them
to important people for favors.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.883
One of those women is a girl
by the name of Brenna Montrose.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.519
She ended up dead before
I could take Garrison down.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.022
Makes you wonder what rock
a guy like that crawled out

26:32.091 --> 26:33.223
-from under.
-A rich one.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.792
Yeah, I know.

26:34.860 --> 26:38.429
Marvin Garrison's his dad--
Silicon Valley royalty.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.631
How you doing?
How's it going

26:41.700 --> 26:44.368
being a trans woman
on the force?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.537
It was tough for a bit.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.639
I'm not the first trans cop
in San Francisco,

26:49.708 --> 26:52.842
but folks knew who I was
because of my uncle.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.846
It took a while with people
getting on board with me

26:55.914 --> 26:58.882
being Nick's niece
and not nephew.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.587
Yeah, I get that.
Well, my money's on you.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.034
-You all right
back there, Bubba?
-Oh, that was really funny.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.202
Really funny.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.938
-All right, what do we know?
-First DOA--

27:22.007 --> 27:25.342
Alvin Cardoza, tourist, age 30.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.277
Next-- Jeff Delancey,

27:27.346 --> 27:30.814
former MMA fighter, lived
across the bay in Emeryville.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.884
On probation for selling oxy.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.452
He pissed somebody off.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.321
That feels like
collateral damage.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.589
Somebody female.
We found some hair

27:39.591 --> 27:42.192
-and a fingernail on the body.
-Hmm.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.460
Thanks, Pete.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.964
Maybe a lover's quarrel?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.699
I don't know, Joe.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.169
Do you bring a ninja star
to a lover's quarrel?

27:52.237 --> 27:54.705
Hey, did it occur to you that--
I don't know--

27:54.773 --> 27:56.373
call me when you
got word of a new victim?

27:56.441 --> 28:00.643
You know, it occurred to me.
Then I moved on.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.980
I may have an opportunity to
get you close to Garrison.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.383
-Yeah?
-He's throwing himself a party
later today

28:06.385 --> 28:07.584
for a new start-up.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.286
A coder buddy
got me on the list.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.054
-Oh, take me as your plus-one.
-No, no, no, no, no.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.389
Absolutely not.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.990
Your orders
are to work this case

28:13.992 --> 28:16.927
-and this case alone.
-You like to hover, don't you?

28:16.995 --> 28:18.495
-: Plus-one.
-You got it.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.648
You play too much.

28:41.753 --> 28:44.387
Listen, Garrison's gonna spot me
as soon as I get inside.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.989
I doubt I'll be here very long.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.492
So look around and see
what you can find.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.093
I know these type of parties.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.496
There's going to be security
but I'll poke around.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.365
If you don't see me,

28:55.434 --> 28:58.435
I'll pick you up
two blocks down on Stockton.

29:02.507 --> 29:05.642
Ooh. Shouldn't you buy the guy
dinner first?

29:05.710 --> 29:08.145
-Long time no see, Joe.
-Hmm.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.814
Same lame jokes.
Heard you were back.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.249
Yeah, well,
bad news travels fast.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.786
Uh, what do you got on
the Sunset District murders?

29:15.854 --> 29:18.321
Oh, uh, no consistent
cause of death.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.124
Not much in common
with the victims.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.594
Couple were tough guys,
hit man for the mob

29:23.662 --> 29:25.128
and an up-and-coming boxer.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.764
-Uh-huh. Who's he?
-John Doe.

29:27.832 --> 29:30.601
Too early to say, but
I'm guessing victim number 12.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.869
-Mm.
-Based on his tattoos, I'd say

29:32.937 --> 29:35.706
he's from Eastern Europe.
Cyrillic alphabet.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.242
He was damn near cut in half.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.344
And we're talking serious force.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.545
Anything else?

29:42.615 --> 29:44.881
Three victims
have syringe marks.

29:44.950 --> 29:45.716
Junkies?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.886
No. Uh, victims
with syringe marks had

29:48.954 --> 29:52.255
elevated levels of adrenaline,
like off the charts.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.657
What does that mean?

29:53.725 --> 29:55.792
Well, I know one thing--
I won't figure it out

29:55.861 --> 29:58.327
as long as I have you
yapping at me all day.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.496
Out.

29:59.564 --> 30:02.365
Yeah. Well, it's been a slice.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.701
Yow.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.811
Hi.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.785
Nash Bridges.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.622
Why am I not surprised
to see you here?

30:25.690 --> 30:29.359
What can I say, Trev?
I'm a sucker for a good party.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.228
Yeah, I hear you're back
on the force, huh?

30:32.297 --> 30:35.832
Yeah, it turns out that
the guy behind my suspension

30:35.901 --> 30:37.567
liked running around
with young girls.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.268
Speaking of,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.538
I look around here and
there's a bunch of young girls.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.607
Looks like it's almost
their bedtime.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.777
It's a party, Nash.
I don't check IDs.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.146
-But congratulations.
-Thank you.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.616
Yeah, someone was leaning on
this commissioner

30:53.686 --> 30:55.552
to take me down.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.621
Coincidentally,

30:57.623 --> 31:00.190
right around the time
of your arrest.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.840
Is your father here?

31:16.908 --> 31:18.775
'Cause I would love
to meet the guy

31:18.844 --> 31:21.010
that revolutionized
the Internet.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.679
And then he moved on
to something else.

31:22.748 --> 31:25.448
It was something big,
something mind-blowing.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.684
-It was, uh...
-I don't know.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.086
You'll have to ask him.

31:29.154 --> 31:31.421
Nanobots.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.289
Nanobots, that's what it was.

31:33.358 --> 31:37.193
These tiny, tiny, tiny little
robots that get into your body

31:37.262 --> 31:39.730
and your bloodstream and they
find cancer cells and kill them.

31:39.798 --> 31:43.066
I mean, that's incredible.
So cool.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.867
You must be so proud.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.937
Well, he couldn't
make it today, Nash.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.772
At least you're here, right?

31:51.310 --> 31:52.843
Let's cut the crap.

31:53.946 --> 31:58.048
What I know--
what everybody here knows--

31:58.116 --> 32:01.918
is you're a twisted freak.
That's your business.

32:01.986 --> 32:05.288
But when you start
victimizing young women,

32:05.290 --> 32:07.424
and one of them dies,

32:07.492 --> 32:09.158
-that's my business.
-Look,

32:09.228 --> 32:11.227
I was cleared
of all charges. Okay?

32:11.296 --> 32:14.998
Whatever brought you back here,

32:15.066 --> 32:16.800
I'm gonna get you.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.835
Sounds like a threat.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.906
Good. Good.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.753
I remember now.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.088
Right?
Yeah.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.761
-Good.
-Trev, who's your friend?

32:46.231 --> 32:48.031
This is Nash Bridges.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.633
He's a cop.
And he was just on his way...

32:50.702 --> 32:52.235
I got this.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.737
It's your party.
Why don't you go enjoy yourself.

33:05.183 --> 33:09.219
Okay. You got my attention.
So who are you?

33:10.855 --> 33:13.123
Want me to take a stab at it?

33:13.191 --> 33:16.025
You're another son
of a billionaire who couldn't

33:16.027 --> 33:18.928
live up to Daddy, so you decided
to become a screwup, too.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.432
-Right?
-Not even close.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.900
You got a warrant?

33:23.968 --> 33:27.637
-I thought it was a party.
-Private party.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.806
Your accent.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.578
American by way
of Ukraine, right?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.947
See Inspector Bridges out.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.050
I can see myself out.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.055
Maybe I'll see you again.

33:54.399 --> 33:57.567
-What are you doing in here?
-I was looking for a bathroom.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.569
There's a bathroom
in the entry area.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.538
Not gender neutral.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.273
This is a private home.

34:03.341 --> 34:04.674
All the bathrooms
are gender neutral.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.610
What a male thing to say.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.513
Does that seem gender neutral?

34:13.151 --> 34:15.552
You know what?
I don't have to go anymore.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.587
And I don't care
for your attitude.

34:19.490 --> 34:23.359
-You're into his computer?
-Yeah, I think so.

34:23.428 --> 34:26.162
I also found a slip
from a parking garage

34:26.231 --> 34:28.464
with writing on the back
underlined.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.968
-You stole that from Trevor?
-It's not stealing if...

34:33.505 --> 34:36.039
-Okay, yeah, I stole it.

34:36.107 --> 34:39.176
-11 digits.
-It could be a wiring number.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.812
I also saw a bill of lading--
could be a plane or a ship.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.947
But I had to bail
before I could find out.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.850
What would he be bringing in?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.787
Eastern European, huh?

34:50.855 --> 34:52.289
Okay, Joe, let's keep this

34:52.357 --> 34:53.657
between you and me
for the moment.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.292
All right, thanks.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.627
Hey, I just got a call
from Garrison's lawyer.

34:57.695 --> 35:00.297
You went to that party
after you were ordered not to.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.932
Well, it seemed like more
of a suggestion.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.334
And you had Chloe
hack into his computer?

35:04.402 --> 35:06.102
You don't think a guy
with a tech background

35:06.170 --> 35:07.804
is gonna notice and shut down
the back-door program

35:07.872 --> 35:10.106
-she put in?
-She was acting under my orders.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.409
If you're gonna rat anybody out,
it'd better be me.

35:12.477 --> 35:15.077
Whoa, rat out? What are you,
in an '80s cop movie?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.713
You know,
you could learn a thing or two

35:16.781 --> 35:17.947
-from '80s cop movies.
-Okay.

35:18.016 --> 35:19.782
No one is ratting out anyone.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.818
I reminded Garrison's attorney
of Rule 570

35:21.886 --> 35:24.053
of the Evidence Code
and he decided to back off

35:24.055 --> 35:25.622
on making any formal complaint.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.491
-Right. 570.
-Right.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.828
You know what the problem
with dinosaurs like you is?

35:31.896 --> 35:34.130
You think
your way is the only way,

35:34.199 --> 35:36.867
with the breaking rules
and cracking skulls.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.671
You accuse me of being
a dirty cop one more time,

35:42.741 --> 35:45.441
-we're gonna have a problem.
-Where have you been?

35:45.510 --> 35:47.043
We already have a problem.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.011
If I didn't
know you better, Steven,

35:49.013 --> 35:50.413
I'd say you were
looking for a fight.

35:50.481 --> 35:54.183
No, no. No, no, no.
I-I can't fight you.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.885
Oh, department protocol?

35:55.954 --> 35:59.055
-Because I'd hurt you.
-Oh, right.

35:59.123 --> 36:01.924
-Mm.
-Man of my advanced years,

36:01.926 --> 36:04.361
just wouldn't stand a chance
against a young...

36:07.365 --> 36:08.164
I owed you that.

36:10.535 --> 36:13.970
Whoa. You okay?
You need medical assistance?

36:24.616 --> 36:26.649
Oh, you wanna dance?
I thought you wanted to fight.

36:26.718 --> 36:30.320
This is capoeira, a Brazilian
form of martial arts.

36:31.456 --> 36:33.023
Oh, I know capoeira.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.059
Yeah, but do you know Muay Thai?

36:40.098 --> 36:41.498
Oh, God.

36:41.566 --> 36:42.866
My money is on Nash.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.702
Stay down,
you're embarrassing yourself.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.840
Scuse me.

36:59.784 --> 37:01.318
Hey!

37:01.386 --> 37:03.652
We got something on what Chloe
found at the party.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.889
Unless you two assholes
want to keep fighting

37:05.957 --> 37:07.557
like a bunch of kids.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.760
Okay.

37:12.797 --> 37:15.565
-Come on!
-Now we're even.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.400
We're really not.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.738
So I ran that 11-digit number.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.440
It's not a wiring number

37:23.508 --> 37:25.107
or an international
phone number,

37:25.109 --> 37:26.042
and it doesn't appear to be

37:26.111 --> 37:27.977
any kind of discernible code.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.546
You broke up
a perfectly good fight

37:29.614 --> 37:31.680
to tell me your supercomputer
is stumped?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.950
We ran the other side
of the card that Chloe

37:34.018 --> 37:36.018
-found at the party.
-Parking lot ticket?

37:36.087 --> 37:37.353
Yeah, it was from
Golden Gate Park,

37:37.355 --> 37:39.289
so we scanned every camera
in the park

37:39.357 --> 37:41.557
for the three hours
after the card was issued.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.492
Some sick shit going on
out there.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.394
We've already met Mike Trumanik.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.063
American-born,
grew up in Ukraine.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.465
That's probably where he
met Garrison-- facilitator

37:49.534 --> 37:51.801
in Kiev. He did about
18 months for gunrunning.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.570
According to Interpol,
he does business

37:53.638 --> 37:56.172
with the highest bidder--
the Taliban, Boko Haram.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.341
Who's the other suit?

37:58.409 --> 38:01.077
-Commissioner Ron Peters.
-Ron Peters,

38:01.145 --> 38:03.245
who signed the papers that
pushed Nash off the force?

38:03.247 --> 38:05.115
Just got put in charge
of the Port of San Francisco.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.519
No. No. No.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.688
-No.
This happening to you?

38:12.757 --> 38:14.724
Yeah, everything's gone black.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.129
We've been hacked.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.771
All right, everybody,
listen up. I need

38:28.840 --> 38:29.972
all your devices--
cell phones, laptops, iPads.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.674
That's work and personal.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.943
Uhp, uhp, no, I don't want
to hear it, you guys.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.211
I don't care how
you're gonna send

38:35.279 --> 38:37.146
your TikToks or your Instagrams.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.882
This is a matter
of national security.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.650
Any cell phones...

38:41.652 --> 38:44.386
Nash, I thought I was clear
that you were to

38:44.456 --> 38:47.723
stay away from Garrison
and focus on these murders.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.225
Lena, don't you think

38:49.293 --> 38:50.994
it's a little bit
coincidental that

38:51.062 --> 38:53.329
I see Garrison yesterday
and we get hacked today?

38:53.398 --> 38:56.398
-No.
-Come on,
you gotta let me look

38:56.468 --> 38:59.602
into the Garrison murder,
'cause I believe strongly

38:59.670 --> 39:00.903
that his murder

39:00.972 --> 39:03.339
and the Sunset killings
are related.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.141
You sure this Garrison thing
isn't just you

39:05.210 --> 39:07.844
with a hard-on for the guy who
got you thrown off the force?

39:07.912 --> 39:10.413
Mm, not entirely.

39:11.716 --> 39:15.218
Fine, but I'm going to need your
help with the rest of SIU.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.220
Most of them are trained
in data mining,

39:17.288 --> 39:19.822
and without that, they're
a little out of their element.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.225
Come on, Joe and I
can take these TikTokers

39:22.227 --> 39:24.494
and turn them
into old-school sleuths.

39:24.562 --> 39:27.029
Okay, fine, but first: shrink.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.598
-Oh...
-No, I don't wanna hear it.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.434
Nash, you said
you were gonna go.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.002
Go.

39:33.071 --> 39:36.238
Okay. Just tell me
what's on your mind.

39:36.308 --> 39:40.643
Um, hmm.
I don't want to be here.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.278
That's what's on my mind.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.547
You're resisting. Let's talk.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.983
I'm resisting 'cause
I don't wanna be here.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.185
The SIU has been hacked and...

39:49.254 --> 39:51.387
I got people getting killed
all over my city.

39:51.456 --> 39:54.124
Why don't you sit down?

39:56.695 --> 39:57.660
Okay.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.998
What do I gotta do to get you
to sign off on me?

40:02.066 --> 40:04.600
Just be open and honest.

40:04.602 --> 40:07.737
You knew who I was the other day
at the coffee truck, didn't you?

40:09.874 --> 40:11.874
I did.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.144
Not very open and honest, Doc.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.979
Fair enough, I apologize.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.748
Well, why don't you just
sign off on me now

40:18.816 --> 40:20.650
and then we can finish
this conversation over

40:20.718 --> 40:23.353
a nice Vietnamese coffee
or a drink.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.225
Uh, I meant finish the session.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.993
Is there a rule against that?

40:31.062 --> 40:32.128
A huge one.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.430
You've had issues
with boundaries

40:34.498 --> 40:36.132
since the beginning of
your career, haven't you?

40:36.134 --> 40:37.967
Well, now you're starting to
sound like Steven Colton.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.237
You have a problem
with Inspector Colton?

40:41.306 --> 40:42.939
Well, considering we were
just beating the crap

40:43.007 --> 40:45.675
out of each other,
I'm gonna have to say yes.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.845
I gotta go.

40:49.914 --> 40:53.316
Okay, well,
let's reschedule for...

40:53.384 --> 40:55.318
Come on. Isn't this just
like a rubber stamp

40:55.386 --> 40:57.520
or are you just
stringing this out because

40:57.589 --> 41:00.022
-you want to see me again?

41:00.091 --> 41:02.124
It's okay, you're only human.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.761
That is the craziest thing
you've said so far.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.031
I'll call you.

41:12.270 --> 41:16.806
Well, this is a first for me--
doing cop work at a weed shop.

41:16.874 --> 41:20.609
Yes, it is unorthodox,
but until the FBI has fully

41:20.678 --> 41:22.979
swept SIU for any bugs
or surveillance devices,

41:23.047 --> 41:25.615
Joe has kindly offered up
his shop.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.049
If we don't have a warrant,

41:27.117 --> 41:28.150
how we able to go through
all this stuff

41:28.219 --> 41:29.685
from the Port of San Francisco?

41:29.687 --> 41:31.020
And why are we going
through documents

41:31.022 --> 41:32.088
like goddamn Pilgrims?

41:32.156 --> 41:33.922
Because we got hacked.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.759
The way you guys spend all day
in front of your devices,

41:36.828 --> 41:38.928
numbing your brains,
we're going to miss something.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.630
Come on, get some paper cuts.

41:40.698 --> 41:42.799
Says the guy who's stoned
out of his mind.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.067
To your question,
under the Patriot Act,

41:45.136 --> 41:46.568
we can do random searches

41:46.638 --> 41:48.704
of airports,
train stations, ports.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.307
Oh, so as long
as we're not specific,

41:51.376 --> 41:52.809
we can look at every record.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.243
If we're not focused on
a particular person,

41:54.312 --> 41:55.545
we're covered.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.880
But we are focused on Garrison.

41:57.948 --> 41:59.915
Are we though?

41:59.984 --> 42:01.317
If I didn't know you better,

42:01.386 --> 42:03.185
I'd think you were
cutting corners, Steve-O.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.154
-Ooh...
-Okay.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.589
-Hey.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.606
How's business?

42:23.674 --> 42:25.441
Booming.

42:25.509 --> 42:28.010
-Where you been?
-Shrink.

42:28.079 --> 42:30.112
-Oh, still crazy?
-Apparently.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.480
Ah...

42:31.549 --> 42:33.015
Let's find out.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.217
Remember that 11-digit number
that Chloe found?

42:35.286 --> 42:37.053
It's a hull
identification number

42:37.121 --> 42:39.688
on a Ukrainian trawler docked
at the Emery Cove Marina

42:39.757 --> 42:42.791
two nights ago on an expedited
high-security basis.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.627
Signed off on by our friend
Commissioner Peters?

42:45.697 --> 42:47.363
Yeah, and it's still there.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.865
It's owned by
a shell corporation which

42:48.933 --> 42:50.433
is owned by
another shell corporation.

42:50.501 --> 42:51.567
But guess who owns that?

42:51.635 --> 42:53.235
Now, if you tell me
Trevor Garrison,

42:53.304 --> 42:54.770
I may have to kiss you.

42:54.772 --> 42:57.807
Would you settle for
a search warrant instead?

43:00.811 --> 43:02.578
All right,
I checked the manifest.

43:02.646 --> 43:04.413
There are four people
unaccounted for.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.616
They're probably still on board.

43:07.785 --> 43:10.652
-Oh, of course.
-Of course what?

43:10.722 --> 43:12.555
Why are you pulling your guns?

43:12.623 --> 43:14.724
Checking them to see
if they're ready.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.825
You know, I haven't pulled
my gun in my entire time

43:16.895 --> 43:17.760
on the force.

43:17.828 --> 43:19.862
-You're kidding me.
-No, I'm not kidding.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.565
Nash, I talk to people-- you
might wanna try it sometime.

43:23.635 --> 43:25.000
I love talking to people,

43:25.069 --> 43:27.437
as long as they're not
throwing hot lead at me.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.173
Okay, well, wait for me
at least.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.757
Psst.

43:49.259 --> 43:51.994
Smart move, boys.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.597
Okay, keep playing.
Don't let me see you again.

44:01.706 --> 44:04.040
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:04.042 --> 44:06.175
Whoa!

44:06.244 --> 44:07.976
Okay!
Whoa, whoa...

44:07.978 --> 44:12.214
Freeze! SFPD.
Put down the pipe.

44:12.283 --> 44:14.784
Okay, okay, let's-let's just
take the temperature down here.

44:14.852 --> 44:17.653
I'm-I'm Steven.
What's your name?

44:17.722 --> 44:19.187
:
Vladimir.

44:19.257 --> 44:20.923
Okay.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.826
Well, Vladimir,
we have a search warrant.

44:23.895 --> 44:25.261
We're investigating
Trevor Garrison.

44:25.329 --> 44:28.030
You do not care about my weed?

44:28.098 --> 44:29.932
You have weed?

44:30.001 --> 44:33.536
You know, marijuana is legal
in California, Bubba.

44:33.604 --> 44:36.105
-It's a lot of weed.
-Oh, really?

44:36.174 --> 44:39.141
You know, I'm in the weed
business myself. We should talk.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.742
You're not making a weed deal.

44:40.812 --> 44:43.179
I'm not gonna make a weed deal.
Come on.

44:43.247 --> 44:45.381
Okay, well, just...
-I'm gonna go look around.

44:45.449 --> 44:46.715
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

44:46.717 --> 44:48.418
Okay, I'll stay here
with the suspect.

44:49.587 --> 44:52.555
We won't talk about weed.
I promise.

44:58.329 --> 45:01.631
All right, this has been
slept in recently.

45:01.699 --> 45:05.133
Okay, Goldilocks.
It was probably Vladimir.

45:05.203 --> 45:08.671
Uh, Vladdy doesn't have
red hair.

45:10.508 --> 45:11.774
Mm-hmm.

45:14.245 --> 45:15.645
So, how much trouble am I in?

45:15.713 --> 45:18.681
Depends on how you answer
our next couple questions.

45:18.749 --> 45:20.348
Smuggling in
undocumented immigrants

45:20.418 --> 45:21.383
is a pretty serious crime.

45:21.452 --> 45:25.087
80 years in the slammer,
mandatory.

45:25.155 --> 45:27.823
That's... true.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.459
Tell us who you brought over
other than the two guys we just

45:30.528 --> 45:32.094
arrested and maybe you
keep your freedom.

45:32.162 --> 45:34.564
And your 50 pounds of
Lithuanian sativa.

45:36.867 --> 45:38.267
Came up in conversation.

45:38.269 --> 45:40.069
There were two more men.

45:40.071 --> 45:43.673
One big red hair, red beard;

45:43.741 --> 45:47.043
the other bald,
big bushy eyebrows like Stalin,

45:47.111 --> 45:50.546
and big black circles
under his eyes.

45:50.615 --> 45:53.749
Like-- how you say?-- a zombie.

45:53.818 --> 45:56.218
Sounds like
a real handsome fellow.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.721
Don't objectify people
based on their appearance.

45:58.789 --> 46:00.890
You are not
getting politically correct

46:00.958 --> 46:02.824
over a Ukrainian stowaway.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.326
It's not politically correct.

46:04.395 --> 46:06.128
It's just regular correct.

46:06.197 --> 46:07.964
A person's appearance
shouldn't be fodder for you...

46:08.032 --> 46:10.333
But you don't have
to correct me.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.767
'Cause HR comes to me.

46:11.836 --> 46:13.202
Everything okay with you two?

46:13.271 --> 46:14.871
Shut up, Vladimir.

46:15.973 --> 46:18.107
That's-- I didn't--

46:18.175 --> 46:19.908
I-I'm sorry, that's-- I--

46:19.910 --> 46:22.912
You bring me to this
and I don't...

46:22.980 --> 46:25.914
Look, what happened
when you docked here?

46:25.983 --> 46:28.850
Mr. Garrison called,
said to send the men out.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.954
That he'd call with more
instructions about the trawler.

46:32.022 --> 46:33.055
And did he?

46:34.659 --> 46:37.259
-Hmm.
-You did good, Vladdy.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.361
-Good job.
-I can go?

46:39.430 --> 46:40.763
Oh, hell no.

46:40.831 --> 46:42.264
You assaulted a cop.

46:42.333 --> 46:43.265
But you said.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.467
Yeah, I know. We lied.

46:45.536 --> 46:47.736
It's going around.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.672
Stand up, turn around.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.807
We'll put in a good word
for you, but, uh,

46:51.876 --> 46:53.676
: call me later
and we'll talk about...

46:53.744 --> 46:55.244
-You know?
-Listen,

46:55.313 --> 46:58.948
I guess you pulling your gun
wasn't not a good idea.

46:59.016 --> 47:00.649
I'm touched.

47:00.718 --> 47:02.284
Now, was that so hard?

47:02.353 --> 47:03.752
More than you can imagine.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.622
-Oh, you'll get used to it.
-: Okay.

47:06.691 --> 47:08.090
-Is it true?
-As we speak,

47:08.158 --> 47:10.859
Trevor Garrison is on his way
into federal custody.

47:10.861 --> 47:13.061
He'll be charged with three
counts of illegal trafficking.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.831
It's not for what he did to
Brenna Montrose, but it'll do.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.700
Chloe found some things
on Garrison's computer,

47:17.768 --> 47:19.768
a couple of satellite images.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.870
One of the pinball museum
down at Fisherman's Wharf

47:21.939 --> 47:24.941
and also of the abandoned arms
depot out at Treasure Island.

47:25.009 --> 47:27.409
There were bodies found
near both of those places.

47:27.478 --> 47:28.778
Yeah.
-So Trevor Garrison

47:28.846 --> 47:30.312
was involved
with the Sunset killings.

47:30.381 --> 47:33.415
We got that son of a bitch
on a no-bail hold.

47:33.484 --> 47:36.518
We figure a rich guy like Trev,
if he spends a few hours

47:36.587 --> 47:37.953
in federal lockup,

47:38.021 --> 47:39.722
maybe it'll motivate him
to talk.

47:39.790 --> 47:43.258
In the meantime, we still gotta
work the Sunset killings case.

47:43.327 --> 47:44.794
We gotta go old-school.

47:44.862 --> 47:48.230
What that means is trusting
yourselves, trusting each other.

47:48.298 --> 47:50.366
But most of all,
trusting your instincts.

47:50.434 --> 47:54.003
It's about seeing what you want.

47:55.606 --> 47:58.540
And going after it
with a laser focus.

47:58.609 --> 48:00.843
You know, good police work,
it's not complicated.

48:00.911 --> 48:04.946
It's about reacting to
new information in the moment.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.216
Christine is my sister.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.823
Now, that's definitely
new information.

48:14.925 --> 48:16.425
You going to be okay
talking to Garrison?

48:16.494 --> 48:18.995
-Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
-'Cause he ruined your life?

48:19.063 --> 48:21.530
-No, Steven, you ruined my life.
-Okay.

48:21.532 --> 48:23.032
-Is she really your sister?
-Yes.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.434
-Like biological?
-Yes.

48:25.436 --> 48:27.369
I mean, 'cause she doesn't
look anything like you.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.905
-She has a different last name.
-She's divorced.

48:29.974 --> 48:33.409
-Oh, that means she's single.
-Not for you.

48:33.477 --> 48:35.077
What...?

48:35.146 --> 48:37.646
I just heard from the warden
in federal lockup.

48:37.715 --> 48:40.783
Don't tell me.
Garrison lawyered up

48:40.851 --> 48:42.284
and we're not invited.

48:42.352 --> 48:44.253
He's dead.

48:45.556 --> 48:46.822
What?

48:51.862 --> 48:53.629
Garrison was alone five minutes
after he was booked.

48:53.697 --> 48:55.430
When they came back in
to check on him,

48:55.500 --> 48:58.133
-he'd hung himself.
-I know Garrison.

48:58.202 --> 49:00.803
There is no way
he killed himself.

49:00.871 --> 49:03.438
Joe's got some informants
over in federal lockup.

49:03.507 --> 49:04.840
Why don't you go with him,
go over there

49:04.908 --> 49:06.441
-and see what you can find out.
-I will.

49:06.511 --> 49:09.779
I'm going to go have a slightly
more difficult conversation.

49:15.586 --> 49:18.220
Been expecting a visit
like this for years.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.457
Doesn't make it any easier.

49:24.562 --> 49:27.763
Do you have any idea
who killed my son?

49:29.400 --> 49:33.535
My partner talked
to some people in lockup.

49:33.537 --> 49:37.172
The killing was likely carried
out by a Chinese street gang.

49:37.241 --> 49:38.540
Oh, God.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.810
-Yeah.
-Trevor.

49:41.912 --> 49:46.047
They were paid for it, so...

49:46.117 --> 49:48.517
If Trevor had any enemies,
now would be a good time to...

49:48.519 --> 49:50.552
He was running around
with this group

49:50.554 --> 49:52.521
that he had fallen in with...

49:52.523 --> 49:54.990
when he was abroad and...

49:55.059 --> 49:57.259
well, one of them came to me
with a business idea

49:57.328 --> 49:58.861
and I sent him away.

49:58.929 --> 50:02.665
-Mike Trumanik?
-Yeah, exactly.

50:05.035 --> 50:09.471
Sorry. It's a biotech deal
that I'm looking at.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.940
I'm sorry-- NDAs.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.943
The Defense Department
insists on secrecy.

50:15.012 --> 50:18.546
Sorry, I'm a... I'm a snoop.
Force of habit.

50:18.616 --> 50:21.349
Do you, uh, have any children,
Inspector?

50:21.419 --> 50:23.419
Yeah.

50:23.487 --> 50:25.687
I have a daughter.

50:25.756 --> 50:30.025
She used to be a cop.
Now she's in the military.

50:31.228 --> 50:32.695
Army intelligence.

50:34.498 --> 50:37.266
I begged Trevor to find
something of his own.

50:38.869 --> 50:42.304
Growing up the son
of the great Marvin Garrison.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.574
I've been living in
my own shadow for years.

50:46.644 --> 50:50.579
I wrote code 30 years ago
that changed the way

50:50.647 --> 50:54.949
information is processed.
But since then?

50:55.019 --> 51:00.789
Ah. World has changed,
Inspector Bridges.

51:00.791 --> 51:04.025
Change with it,
or you get left behind.

51:04.095 --> 51:07.696
Again, I'm sorry.

51:19.310 --> 51:21.977
I tried to get to
Commissioner Peters.

51:22.046 --> 51:24.146
Oh, I'm betting
he's out of the country.

51:24.215 --> 51:26.315
Maldives.
No extradition treaty.

51:26.383 --> 51:29.551
Yeah, courtesy of
a one-way ticket.

51:29.553 --> 51:30.819
Trevor Garrison.

51:30.888 --> 51:32.554
What are you
so happy about today?

51:32.623 --> 51:34.823
Feel good today.

51:34.892 --> 51:37.459
Why? Hitting the streets,
just like the old days?

51:37.528 --> 51:40.162
Nah. Because you're trying
to sleep with his sister

51:40.230 --> 51:41.763
-and he knows it.
-Okay,

51:41.832 --> 51:44.466
no one's trying to sleep
with anyone's sister.

51:44.534 --> 51:45.901
Mm...

51:48.872 --> 51:49.972
We're looking for Teddy Ko.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.007
-Is he here?

51:55.379 --> 51:58.613
Well, that was impactful.

51:58.682 --> 52:01.483
You got a warrant, Bridges?

52:01.551 --> 52:04.319
Oh, hey there, Teddy.

52:04.388 --> 52:07.823
-It's just a social call.
-It's a social club, isn't it?

52:11.629 --> 52:13.162
You bring your son with you?

52:13.230 --> 52:16.598
Oh, God, no. No, no.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.033
We just happen to work together.

52:18.101 --> 52:20.535
-I'm his boss.
-Oh, yeah.

52:20.604 --> 52:22.270
-He's my boss.
-I am.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.673
Listen, Teddy,
we got a little situation.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.309
We have some questions.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.413
See, this is what's wrong
with the younger generation.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.649
Always in a rush.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.217
No respect for the old ways.

52:35.285 --> 52:38.219
You're singing my song, Teddy.

52:38.289 --> 52:41.356
But with all due respect, we are
in a little bit of a rush.

52:41.425 --> 52:43.458
There was a guy
that got murdered down

52:43.527 --> 52:47.362
-in county lockup today.
-I heard he killed himself.

52:47.431 --> 52:48.764
That hasn't been
released to the public.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.165
How do you know that?

52:51.301 --> 52:54.636
Your friend comes into my club,
insults me?

52:54.705 --> 52:56.838
Yeah, I'm sorry, Teddy.

52:56.907 --> 53:01.543
Um, he's got an excuse--
he's an asshole.

53:01.611 --> 53:02.911
Excuse me?

53:02.980 --> 53:05.280
But he's got a chance
of outgrowing that.

53:05.349 --> 53:08.183
You're a criminal.
That's for life.

53:15.659 --> 53:18.393
Next time you come,
have a warrant.

53:18.462 --> 53:20.896
That's a good idea.

53:22.132 --> 53:24.233
That wasn't losing your cool?

53:24.301 --> 53:26.267
I mean, I-I appreciate you
sticking up for me.

53:26.269 --> 53:28.937
-I really do, but...
-I wasn't sticking up for you.

53:28.939 --> 53:30.739
True, he called you an asshole.

53:30.808 --> 53:32.775
Okay.

53:38.349 --> 53:41.149
You look more confused
than usual.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.752
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

53:43.821 --> 53:47.122
Teddy can't be seen
giving us anything,

53:47.191 --> 53:49.724
so Nash takes a shot at Teddy,

53:49.794 --> 53:52.294
Teddy's guys take a couple shots
at Nash.

53:52.362 --> 53:55.964
Teddy maintains his cred.
Now they can talk.

53:57.334 --> 53:59.234
It's Chinatown, Jake.

54:00.838 --> 54:02.104
What?

54:03.006 --> 54:04.173
You okay?

54:04.241 --> 54:06.107
Yeah, I was expecting
the first one,

54:06.176 --> 54:08.110
but the second one kind of
caught me by surprise.

54:08.178 --> 54:10.712
My employee said he decided
to go freelance.

54:10.781 --> 54:12.414
Again, young people.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.615
Listen, we're hearing

54:13.683 --> 54:15.317
the Jackson Street Boyz
carried out

54:15.319 --> 54:17.085
the hit on Trevor Garrison.
What do you got?

54:17.153 --> 54:18.787
I heard it had something
to do with gambling.

54:18.855 --> 54:19.888
-Gambling?
-Mm.

54:19.957 --> 54:21.657
Any gambling in this town,
you get a piece.

54:21.725 --> 54:24.259
Not with these kind of people.

54:24.328 --> 54:26.795
They're bad for my business.

54:26.864 --> 54:29.798
This is for
a particular clientele.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.333
Mm.

54:31.401 --> 54:34.469
I heard something
about them gathering tonight.

54:34.538 --> 54:35.304
Tonight?

54:35.372 --> 54:37.272
All right,
I'm gonna need another favor.

54:37.341 --> 54:39.341
I've done enough favors
for you in one day.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.676
Come on, who's counting?
Besides, I might be able

54:41.745 --> 54:44.380
to keep these people
from moving in on you.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.792
I don't like this, Nash.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.428
Teddy says
it's going down tonight,

54:59.496 --> 55:01.530
and they damn sure aren't gonna
let you or me in there.

55:01.598 --> 55:03.432
So why don't we
bust the place up, right?

55:03.500 --> 55:05.234
Pick everybody up,
get people to flip?

55:05.302 --> 55:07.136
'Cause nobody's gonna flip.

55:07.204 --> 55:09.171
Listen to me.
Ellie is one of the best

55:09.239 --> 55:11.340
undercover operatives we have.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.175
If anybody can get
on the inside,

55:13.243 --> 55:16.145
and get us up the food chain,
it's her.

55:19.316 --> 55:22.684
God, this thong is riding up
in every way imaginable.

55:23.954 --> 55:26.388
Okay, so now look, we're going
to be about a block away,

55:26.457 --> 55:28.356
but you're going to be
on your own.

55:28.425 --> 55:30.625
They're going to search you,
so you can't carry a weapon.

55:30.694 --> 55:33.461
Not sure where I'd hide it
in this thing anyhow.

55:33.463 --> 55:36.532
All right, listen,
this is courtesy of Teddy Ko.

55:37.701 --> 55:39.835
That'll get you on the inside.
And I've got you

55:39.903 --> 55:41.437
something that's, uh,

55:41.505 --> 55:43.238
it's the best
I could come up with

55:43.240 --> 55:44.473
in our new low-tech reality.

55:44.541 --> 55:47.142
If you get in trouble,
hit the unlock button.

55:47.210 --> 55:50.412
-It'll send us a signal.
-We'll be a block away.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.480
We'll get there in a hurry.

55:52.549 --> 55:55.450
Now, I'm gonna give you guys
a minute, all right?

55:55.452 --> 55:57.152
I'll meet you at the van.

55:59.689 --> 56:02.391
Hey, asshole, we had a deal.
We're partners,

56:02.459 --> 56:04.693
we sleep together--
no strings, no commitment.

56:04.761 --> 56:05.761
I know our deal.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.897
'Cause it looks like
you're falling in love with me.

56:08.965 --> 56:10.565
-Stop.

56:10.634 --> 56:12.901
Okay, look, if anybody's
falling in love with anybody...

56:12.969 --> 56:15.470
I know I look hot in this dress,
but I'm gonna need you to

56:15.539 --> 56:17.806
hold your shit together, man.

56:17.874 --> 56:20.242
You do look good in that dress.

56:20.310 --> 56:22.344
All right, fine. Fine.

56:29.520 --> 56:31.320
I don't know about this, man.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.241
Okay, she's in.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.585
One-to-five odds
on Hitman McDaniels,

57:03.654 --> 57:05.320
-a huge favorite.
Slice him up!

57:05.389 --> 57:08.957
Okay, I've got
one million on "The Hitman."

57:09.026 --> 57:11.226
Over/under on the match
is four minutes.

57:14.564 --> 57:17.199
-Yeah! Get him! Get him!

57:17.201 --> 57:21.370
Half-million parlay on
The Hitman with the under.

57:23.006 --> 57:26.841
No more action--
we're not taking any more bets.

57:32.182 --> 57:34.449
Come on! Get him!

57:41.358 --> 57:43.958
Hey. I need you to blow.

57:44.028 --> 57:45.260
Excuse me?

57:45.328 --> 57:46.995
My dice, for luck.

57:47.064 --> 57:50.565
Oh. I'll tell you what:
why don't you blow yourself

57:50.634 --> 57:52.968
and see how that
works out for you?

57:53.770 --> 57:56.237
Come on!

57:57.807 --> 58:01.142
The Hitman has him on the ropes.

58:03.714 --> 58:07.683
If anyone had decapitation
as a prop bet...

58:12.222 --> 58:17.159
And Hitman wins!
He runs his record to 12-0.

58:24.934 --> 58:26.468
Hey.

58:26.536 --> 58:28.103
What do you want?

58:28.171 --> 58:29.838
We want you to come to a party.

58:29.906 --> 58:31.940
I'll pass.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.543
It wasn't an invitation.

58:43.086 --> 58:45.287
Impressive.

58:46.323 --> 58:50.092
Wait.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.370
I apologize for my nephews.

59:03.039 --> 59:05.440
Where did you learn
Nanyuan fighting?

59:05.508 --> 59:07.609
My grandfather.

59:07.677 --> 59:10.312
Did you enjoy watching
the fight inside?

59:11.681 --> 59:14.649
-It was okay.
-What would make it better?

59:14.717 --> 59:15.651
Me.

59:26.496 --> 59:29.431
He doesn't have a daughter.

59:30.634 --> 59:33.835
What if I offered
to pay you to fight?

59:33.837 --> 59:36.337
I'd say hell yes.

59:36.339 --> 59:38.674
Why?

59:39.843 --> 59:42.210
'Cause I have nothing to lose.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.058
I'm just saying,
we're already compromised.

59:57.060 --> 59:58.293
Going to an outside guy
feels risky.

59:58.361 --> 1:00:00.061
Hey, we need someone
off the grid

1:00:00.063 --> 1:00:02.230
and this guy
is way off the grid.

1:00:02.299 --> 1:00:05.300
Oh, when we get in there,
don't make any sudden moves.

1:00:06.803 --> 1:00:11.773
-Nash? Is that you?
-Who else would I be?

1:00:11.842 --> 1:00:13.674
Prove it.

1:00:13.744 --> 1:00:15.910
Uh, o-okay.

1:00:15.979 --> 1:00:18.479
Uh, we were running down
bad guys in the Fillmore

1:00:18.549 --> 1:00:22.717
-and you had Ethiopian food.
- Nash!

1:00:25.055 --> 1:00:26.454
-Hey.
-Who's the stiff?

1:00:26.456 --> 1:00:27.589
He's with me.
Can we come in?

1:00:27.658 --> 1:00:29.524
Yeah, come in, come in.

1:00:30.561 --> 1:00:34.296
-Come on. Come on, come on!
-O-Okay, okay, okay.

1:00:36.933 --> 1:00:40.469
I realized 15 years ago that

1:00:40.537 --> 1:00:43.005
every time you went online,

1:00:43.073 --> 1:00:47.275
every time you bought something

1:00:47.343 --> 1:00:53.081
or posted about how delicious
your latte was that morning,

1:00:53.083 --> 1:00:55.016
-they were watching.
-They?

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:57.586
Yeah, did you know
data surpassed oil

1:00:57.654 --> 1:00:59.520
as the world's most
valuable commodity?

1:00:59.590 --> 1:01:01.656
No, I wasn't aware.

1:01:01.724 --> 1:01:05.027
That's why I went off-line
and stayed online,

1:01:05.095 --> 1:01:10.031
so I can watch them watching us.
Okay.

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:11.433
So what do you need?

1:01:11.501 --> 1:01:13.502
You're sure
no one can monitor you?

1:01:13.570 --> 1:01:15.436
I'm not the one who got hacked.

1:01:15.506 --> 1:01:16.805
-Okay,

1:01:16.873 --> 1:01:19.241
well, we need you to run down
any unusual activity

1:01:19.309 --> 1:01:21.243
of money being moved around town
the last couple months.

1:01:21.311 --> 1:01:22.977
There's been some
illegal gambling going on.

1:01:23.046 --> 1:01:26.247
-You talked to Teddy Ko?
-Yeah.

1:01:26.316 --> 1:01:28.817
He gave us all he could give us,
but he doesn't know the players.

1:01:28.885 --> 1:01:31.385
Okay, let's give it a whirl.

1:01:31.387 --> 1:01:33.387
Uh, Harvey, I just gotta ask,
how long has it been

1:01:33.457 --> 1:01:35.056
since you've been out
of this apartment?

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.924
Six years, four months,
nine days.

1:01:36.994 --> 1:01:41.162
Okay, so when this is all over,
we're gonna take a little walk.

1:01:41.231 --> 1:01:43.031
-Okay?
-Eh, not likely.

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:46.134
Okay, here's something.

1:01:46.136 --> 1:01:49.938
Wire transfers from cash.

1:01:50.006 --> 1:01:52.340
Walked into
Woodside National Savings.

1:01:52.409 --> 1:01:53.275
Oh.

1:01:53.343 --> 1:01:55.477
That's where the heavy hitters
keep their money.

1:01:55.545 --> 1:01:58.647
It may take longer to tell you
where the money ended up.

1:01:58.715 --> 1:02:01.716
I can tell you when
the deposits were made.

1:02:01.784 --> 1:02:03.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at this.

1:02:03.419 --> 1:02:05.086
All the cash deposits
were made within

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:07.355
24 hours of the Sunset killings
taking place.

1:02:07.423 --> 1:02:11.093
Look at that.
We're onto something.

1:02:11.161 --> 1:02:12.894
Let's just keep digging.

1:02:15.065 --> 1:02:17.832
-Holy shit.
-You better watch that mouth.

1:02:17.834 --> 1:02:20.135
-I found him!
-Seriously?

1:02:20.203 --> 1:02:21.936
Guy's face was on
a wall-sized screen.

1:02:22.005 --> 1:02:22.937
I'm positive.

1:02:23.006 --> 1:02:24.739
Sean McDaniels, huh?

1:02:24.807 --> 1:02:27.942
Assault with a deadly weapon,
attempted murder.

1:02:28.011 --> 1:02:29.511
Seems like a real sweetheart.

1:02:29.579 --> 1:02:31.379
Former MMA fighter.

1:02:31.447 --> 1:02:34.549
Got kicked out of a league last
year for positive PED tests.

1:02:34.617 --> 1:02:37.752
Mm-hmm. We should go...

1:02:37.821 --> 1:02:40.889
:
find him.

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:43.891
All right.

1:02:43.961 --> 1:02:45.993
They're bringing McDaniels
up now.

1:02:46.063 --> 1:02:48.829
Hey, let me be the tough guy
this time, okay?

1:02:48.899 --> 1:02:51.766
-You wanna be the tough guy?
-Hey, man, you dragged my ass

1:02:51.834 --> 1:02:53.267
into this stuff,
so all I'm asking

1:02:53.337 --> 1:02:54.903
is for you to just let me...

1:03:22.231 --> 1:03:24.032
He's all yours, Bubba.

1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:26.401
Who you two supposed to be?

1:03:27.570 --> 1:03:30.371
Shut up, asshole.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:33.007
We got you on video
murdering somebody.

1:03:33.076 --> 1:03:34.843
Man, I didn't murder anybody.

1:03:36.313 --> 1:03:38.079
How'd you get so beat up?

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:39.815
Playing the violin.

1:03:40.783 --> 1:03:42.751
You want to leave us alone
for a minute?

1:03:42.819 --> 1:03:45.887
Come on, man. You think
I'm afraid of a beating?

1:03:49.692 --> 1:03:52.394
I want you to pay very close
attention to what I'm going to

1:03:52.462 --> 1:03:54.895
tell you. The people
you're trying to protect

1:03:54.965 --> 1:03:57.365
don't give a damn about you.

1:03:57.367 --> 1:04:00.134
We arrested a guy who was
in here before you

1:04:00.203 --> 1:04:02.604
on this very same case--
Trevor Garrison.

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:06.942
He's dead.
And he was rich.

1:04:07.010 --> 1:04:08.709
What do you think
they're gonna do to you?

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:13.481
Oh, man.

1:04:15.285 --> 1:04:16.985
It started a couple months ago.

1:04:17.053 --> 1:04:21.089
I'm in a bar, guy comes up,
offers me a fight off the books.

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:25.126
Said there'd be a bonus if I
put the guy in the hospital.

1:04:26.129 --> 1:04:28.096
Next fight, he upped the ante.

1:04:28.164 --> 1:04:31.099
Said there'd be an extra 50
if I, you know...

1:04:31.167 --> 1:04:32.767
Killed your opponent.

1:04:32.836 --> 1:04:36.237
He said if I told anybody,
he'd kill me.

1:04:36.306 --> 1:04:40.709
And anyone I ever cared about.
And that's all I know.

1:04:40.777 --> 1:04:43.311
All right, I want a name
and I want a number.

1:04:43.313 --> 1:04:45.079
Right now.
I'm tired of this.

1:04:50.153 --> 1:04:52.720
Sean?

1:04:52.789 --> 1:04:54.422
-Sean?
-Hey.

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.060
Well, tough guy, you killed him.

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:05.533
You can tell Nash
you didn't kill this guy.

1:05:05.601 --> 1:05:07.736
Well, what was
the cause of death?

1:05:07.804 --> 1:05:10.905
Well, I thought it was
sudden cardiac death.

1:05:10.973 --> 1:05:13.274
The brain's electrical system
causes the heart to shut down.

1:05:13.343 --> 1:05:15.343
You thought it was
cardiac arrest?

1:05:15.345 --> 1:05:18.880
Well, the heart did shut down,
but it had outside help.

1:05:19.683 --> 1:05:23.084
What you're looking at
is six nanometers--

1:05:23.153 --> 1:05:24.452
a millionth of a millimeter.

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.287
I got lucky and found it
in McDaniels'

1:05:26.356 --> 1:05:29.057
-cerebral cortex.
-How did it get there?

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:31.960
Injected into his bloodstream
and made its way up.

1:05:36.066 --> 1:05:37.698
What does this chip do?

1:05:37.768 --> 1:05:40.635
Well, that's
for you geniuses to figure out.

1:05:40.703 --> 1:05:44.172
It was directed to the amygdala,
which controls emotions.

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:45.940
I need to borrow this chip.

1:05:46.008 --> 1:05:48.576
-It's a murder weapon.
-Look, we just need to bring...

1:05:48.644 --> 1:05:50.712
Just bring in the SFPD
Cyber Unit to look at it here.

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:53.214
We've been hacked.
SIU is compromised

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:54.883
and we don't know how far
it goes.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:56.618
And if I let it out of here,

1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:58.786
a first-year public defender
will get it thrown out of court.

1:05:58.788 --> 1:06:01.923
Chain of custody.
You want to show it to someone?

1:06:01.992 --> 1:06:04.292
Get their ass in here.

1:06:11.401 --> 1:06:13.268
I've got my first fight tonight.

1:06:22.612 --> 1:06:24.412
-Coast is clear.
-Come on. It's okay.

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:26.314
Come on, come on, you can...
Harvey, you're doing fine.

1:06:26.382 --> 1:06:27.849
-Come on.
-You're doing fine.

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:32.921
-I can't feel my face.
-Let's see, it's still there.

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:34.422
-Ugly as ever.

1:06:34.491 --> 1:06:36.891
Come on. Here, come on.
Come on.

1:06:36.893 --> 1:06:40.995
Oh, shit, I didn't think
they'd gotten this far.

1:06:41.064 --> 1:06:42.330
What is it?

1:06:42.332 --> 1:06:44.231
You get this in someone's head,

1:06:44.301 --> 1:06:46.968
it controls impulses,
especially aggression.

1:06:48.138 --> 1:06:50.638
You said the adrenaline levels
were off the charts in some

1:06:50.706 --> 1:06:52.306
of the victims,
and that some of the wounds

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:53.942
were the result
of superhuman strength.

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:56.210
Never seen anything like it.

1:06:56.279 --> 1:06:58.880
-Oh, man.
-What else, Harv?

1:07:00.016 --> 1:07:03.651
The guy just dropped dead
on you in interrogation?

1:07:03.719 --> 1:07:05.086
Yeah.

1:07:06.523 --> 1:07:10.225
This thing comes complete
with a kill switch.

1:07:27.743 --> 1:07:29.910
How long has she gotta wait?

1:07:29.980 --> 1:07:32.380
Relax, bro, this is what we do.

1:07:44.127 --> 1:07:45.493
Ah, come on.

1:07:45.495 --> 1:07:47.128
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell?

1:07:47.197 --> 1:07:52.133
-Let's take him.
-Relax, relax.

1:07:53.903 --> 1:07:55.903
We got GPS.
We can track her.

1:08:00.643 --> 1:08:02.277
All right, stay on her.

1:08:04.181 --> 1:08:05.280
Come on!

1:08:07.950 --> 1:08:10.752
-They're gone, we lost her.
Just stay on her.

1:08:10.820 --> 1:08:12.420
She's headed south.

1:08:12.422 --> 1:08:14.122
Come on, let's go!

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:19.627
Make this right and pull over.

1:08:27.337 --> 1:08:29.471
We should be on her right here.

1:08:30.373 --> 1:08:31.706
We're running out of time.

1:08:41.050 --> 1:08:43.451
Shit!

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:46.487
-They found the fob.
-They're gonna kill her.

1:08:46.556 --> 1:08:48.322
We-we don't know that.

1:08:48.391 --> 1:08:49.891
We've got to call it in, right?

1:08:49.959 --> 1:08:51.893
-Uh, put an APB out on the van.
-We know they're monitoring

1:08:51.961 --> 1:08:54.062
the police radio band; if they
know we're looking for her,

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:57.532
-they'll kill her.
-We can't do this alone.

1:09:04.607 --> 1:09:06.907
SFPD. I need to borrow
your phone.

1:09:06.977 --> 1:09:08.776
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.
-No, no, no.

1:09:08.845 --> 1:09:10.411
-Seriously, come on.
-I don't care what
you're looking at.

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.681
I'm... Whoa, dude.
All right.

1:09:15.252 --> 1:09:17.017
This was
absolutely beautiful,

1:09:17.087 --> 1:09:19.320
-wasn't it?
So romantic.

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:23.791
It, like, pretty much...

1:09:23.859 --> 1:09:24.926
Who is this?

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:28.028
Harvey.
-Hey, Nash.

1:09:28.098 --> 1:09:29.263
What's up?

1:09:29.265 --> 1:09:31.165
Harvey, I need a favor.

1:09:31.234 --> 1:09:34.302
No, no, it can't wait until
after The Bachelor.

1:09:34.370 --> 1:09:36.771
Look, look.
I need you to tap into

1:09:36.839 --> 1:09:38.172
the Caltrans traffic site--

1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:40.942
the bridge crossings
and the traffic cams.

1:09:41.010 --> 1:09:43.043
Hell, while you're at it,
you may as well

1:09:43.113 --> 1:09:45.346
tap into the NSA satellite.

1:09:46.883 --> 1:09:48.616
Inside joke with a friend.

1:09:58.794 --> 1:10:01.395
My men tell me
there's a problem?

1:10:01.464 --> 1:10:04.565
I came here to fight.
Now I gotta get some shot, too?

1:10:04.633 --> 1:10:06.134
It's a mild stimulant.

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:08.769
Do I look like
I need a stimulant?

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:11.539
Oh, something's funny?

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:14.742
That you think
you have a choice.

1:10:16.179 --> 1:10:19.780
I imagine you'd like
your GPS back.

1:10:19.849 --> 1:10:22.183
Who's following you, Detective?

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:25.787
You think I'm a cop?

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:28.422
I got a jealous boyfriend,
wants to keep tabs on me.

1:10:28.491 --> 1:10:31.926
You're suspicious enough to
put a hood over my head.

1:10:31.994 --> 1:10:34.262
I gotta look out
for myself, too.

1:11:20.610 --> 1:11:22.143
We ready?

1:11:24.881 --> 1:11:27.382
I'll update it now.
Should be recalibrated.

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:31.052
Where are we going?

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:34.088
-Hey!
-Thought you came here to fight.

1:11:42.131 --> 1:11:44.232
So you know,
when I'm finished out there,

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:46.134
I'm coming back for you two.

1:11:59.349 --> 1:12:01.249
Oh, shit.

1:12:38.121 --> 1:12:39.921
Harvey better be right.

1:12:53.903 --> 1:12:54.936
Hey!

1:12:58.675 --> 1:13:01.441
All right, we're in.
Northeastern rear entrance.

1:13:01.511 --> 1:13:03.377
Send the attack team.

1:13:03.446 --> 1:13:05.113
-If you're going with me,

1:13:05.181 --> 1:13:07.515
you better put a gun
in your hand.

1:13:42.118 --> 1:13:43.951
SFPD! Put down your weapon!

1:13:59.536 --> 1:14:01.635
-Ah!

1:14:40.410 --> 1:14:42.677
Steven, I don't have him!

1:14:42.679 --> 1:14:44.312
Steven,

1:14:44.314 --> 1:14:45.947
I don't have him!

1:14:47.917 --> 1:14:49.617
SFPD! Put her down!

1:14:49.685 --> 1:14:52.019
Steven, take the shot!

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:11.606
Steven? You good?

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:16.277
-Steven! Are you good?
-Yeah, yes.

1:15:26.388 --> 1:15:28.622
-Where'd he get you?
-He-he didn't. He shot--

1:15:28.691 --> 1:15:30.658
He-he injected me,
he injected me.

1:15:30.726 --> 1:15:33.260
All right, relax. Just relax.
You're going to be all right.

1:15:33.329 --> 1:15:35.229
You're gonna be good.
Call a medevac.

1:15:35.297 --> 1:15:37.931
Get a blood dialysis
on her right away.

1:15:38.001 --> 1:15:39.499
Trust me, right?

1:15:39.501 --> 1:15:40.801
-You're gonna be good.
Officer down!

1:15:40.870 --> 1:15:43.571
408 requesting immediate
medical assistance.

1:16:13.135 --> 1:16:14.902
Okay.

1:16:14.904 --> 1:16:16.470
This is gonna hurt.

1:16:22.812 --> 1:16:24.478
SFPD! Hands up!

1:16:24.547 --> 1:16:26.247
Get up, get down on the ground.

1:16:32.354 --> 1:16:33.621
:
Bridges.

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:49.570
Oh!

1:16:50.472 --> 1:16:53.841
Ah... Wow,
that really did hurt.

1:17:05.021 --> 1:17:07.755
-Hey, what's going on?
-Back on line.

1:17:07.823 --> 1:17:09.623
You're all like
a bunch of crackheads.

1:17:09.691 --> 1:17:13.327
-Have you learned nothing?
-Yeah, no technology sucks.

1:17:13.329 --> 1:17:15.329
Joe, can you believe this?

1:17:15.397 --> 1:17:17.131
Hey, look,
I got Tinder matches.

1:17:17.199 --> 1:17:18.366
Oh, my God.

1:17:18.434 --> 1:17:20.067
This whole thing
still blows my mind.

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:22.403
Your mind blows easily.

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:24.638
The Sunset killings
are all either intended

1:17:24.707 --> 1:17:26.840
or unintended victims
of these murder games, right?

1:17:26.909 --> 1:17:28.341
So how does gambling factor in?

1:17:28.411 --> 1:17:31.911
Ah, it was a sick side thing
for Garrison.

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:34.114
If it's his side thing,
what's the main thing?

1:17:34.183 --> 1:17:35.716
We're learning Trumanik
was working with someone

1:17:35.785 --> 1:17:37.284
to build the perfect soldier.

1:17:37.352 --> 1:17:38.986
All this confirms what
I've always known.

1:17:38.988 --> 1:17:42.790
-Rich people are sick.
-Can't argue with that.

1:17:42.858 --> 1:17:44.425
Come on, Romeo, let's go.

1:17:44.493 --> 1:17:46.594
Hey, look. Oh, look.
Hello.

1:17:46.662 --> 1:17:48.328
Aren't you glad you came back
for this one?

1:17:48.397 --> 1:17:50.764
Yeah. I'll be glad
to be going, too.

1:17:50.833 --> 1:17:52.365
Come on, we just got
the band back together.

1:17:52.435 --> 1:17:54.435
Hey, for this one case.

1:17:54.503 --> 1:17:56.670
Hey, a deal's a deal, right?

1:17:56.738 --> 1:17:59.506
Besides, I'm seeing
Victoria tonight.

1:17:59.508 --> 1:18:01.308
Deal's a deal.
Call you tomorrow.

1:18:01.310 --> 1:18:04.278
-Yes, indeed.
-Nash, wait up.

1:18:04.346 --> 1:18:06.880
I got something on
who's been calling the shots.

1:18:06.949 --> 1:18:09.116
There's a router that goes
through five different servers,

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:11.919
pinged everywhere from
Munich to Rio de Janeiro.

1:18:11.987 --> 1:18:14.288
-I don't have the address,
but the neighborhood...
-Pacific Heights.

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:16.123
I should be able
to narrow it down

1:18:16.192 --> 1:18:17.724
-in a couple of hours.
-You don't need to.

1:18:17.793 --> 1:18:19.159
I know who it is.

1:18:19.228 --> 1:18:20.894
I should have known,
Trevor didn't

1:18:20.963 --> 1:18:23.330
have the brains for a plan
this sophisticated.

1:18:23.399 --> 1:18:25.132
I still can't believe it.

1:18:25.201 --> 1:18:27.367
I thought Trumanik
was behind all this.

1:18:27.436 --> 1:18:30.003
He was behind
the super-soldier thing.

1:18:30.072 --> 1:18:32.306
But he couldn't
pull off the technology.

1:18:32.374 --> 1:18:34.141
We were looking
at the wrong Garrison.

1:18:34.210 --> 1:18:36.076
We needed to look at the father.

1:18:36.145 --> 1:18:37.411
Well, we'd better be sure.

1:18:37.479 --> 1:18:39.847
He's the one that hacked
into our systems.

1:18:39.915 --> 1:18:41.749
And those death matches?

1:18:41.751 --> 1:18:45.018
-They were a biotech play.
-And everyone who died?

1:18:45.087 --> 1:18:46.520
They were what?

1:18:46.589 --> 1:18:50.558
Beta testing for Garrison.
They were lab rats.

1:18:56.098 --> 1:18:57.665
-What's going on?

1:18:57.733 --> 1:19:00.134
It looks like somebody
beat us to the punch.

1:19:07.409 --> 1:19:09.710
Inspector Bridges,
it's good to see you again.

1:19:09.778 --> 1:19:11.545
You know, Marvin,

1:19:11.614 --> 1:19:14.714
you really got me
with those crocodile tears.

1:19:14.784 --> 1:19:15.949
It's over, Garrison.

1:19:16.018 --> 1:19:17.384
I don't know.

1:19:17.453 --> 1:19:19.820
Somehow it doesn't
feel that way.

1:19:21.090 --> 1:19:24.358
Oh, if you have anything else,

1:19:24.426 --> 1:19:27.428
I suggest you
refer it to your captain.

1:19:29.097 --> 1:19:31.031
What the hell is going on, Lena?

1:19:31.033 --> 1:19:33.200
This is Senior Agent
Delmore Franks.

1:19:33.269 --> 1:19:34.602
He's with the NSA.

1:19:34.670 --> 1:19:36.837
On behalf of our department,
I want to thank you both

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:39.606
for your service to our city
and the solving

1:19:39.608 --> 1:19:42.242
-of the Sunset killings.
-Mm-hmm. But?

1:19:42.978 --> 1:19:45.478
Marvin Garrison
is in federal custody.

1:19:45.548 --> 1:19:48.148
He's cooperating fully with
an interagency investigation.

1:19:48.217 --> 1:19:49.849
This is bullshit.

1:19:49.851 --> 1:19:51.552
I'd choose your next words
carefully, Inspector Colton.

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:54.554
Yeah, we got it.
Message received.

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:56.456
So I guess we can go now, huh?

1:19:56.458 --> 1:19:58.559
With the thanks of a grateful...

1:19:58.627 --> 1:20:00.794
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go.
-Okay. Hey...

1:20:01.730 --> 1:20:04.831
-Let me go.
-I'm looking after you, dude.

1:20:04.900 --> 1:20:07.935
That's the NSA. You don't
want to screw around with them.

1:20:08.003 --> 1:20:10.604
So, are they going to stop
what Garrison's developing?

1:20:10.672 --> 1:20:13.307
Or are they gonna take it,
weaponize it,

1:20:13.309 --> 1:20:15.442
and give the sick bastard
a sweetheart deal?

1:20:16.412 --> 1:20:18.512
Mm, I'm gonna go
with door number two.

1:20:19.481 --> 1:20:21.248
Okay, so then,
at the end of the day,

1:20:21.317 --> 1:20:22.449
what have we even done here?

1:20:22.517 --> 1:20:25.452
You know,
for a millennial snowflake,

1:20:25.521 --> 1:20:27.321
you're awfully cynical.

1:20:27.389 --> 1:20:29.523
Relax, Steven. Get in.

1:20:37.399 --> 1:20:39.700
Well, I guess that's that.

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:42.970
That's that.

1:20:43.038 --> 1:20:45.539
You figure out your next move?

1:20:47.176 --> 1:20:50.711
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

1:20:52.448 --> 1:20:54.314
...we could use you at SIU.

1:20:54.383 --> 1:20:56.383
:
Really?

1:20:56.452 --> 1:20:58.552
You need me at SIU?

1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:01.355
Okay, that's-that's a,
that's a bit far.

1:21:01.423 --> 1:21:04.191
I'll see you
at the shop tomorrow.

1:21:04.193 --> 1:21:05.558
Right now I'm gonna go home.

1:21:05.628 --> 1:21:08.562
I'm gonna uncork a bottle
of '55 Macallan.

1:21:08.630 --> 1:21:10.464
And I'm gonna take
a nice long pull

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:12.566
and gaze out over my city.

1:21:13.502 --> 1:21:15.502
-Well, I like Scotch.

1:21:15.570 --> 1:21:17.504
But you're not invited.

1:21:17.572 --> 1:21:19.306
Although I am going to
call your sister.

1:21:19.375 --> 1:21:21.375
That's not funny.

1:21:21.443 --> 1:21:23.210
I'm not being funny.

1:21:23.212 --> 1:21:25.212
Well, I'm just saying, let's,
let's take it easy on that.

1:21:33.522 --> 1:21:34.855
Um...

1:21:34.923 --> 1:21:36.023
Hey, man.

1:21:36.091 --> 1:21:37.825
What happened to
"a deal is a deal"?

1:21:37.893 --> 1:21:39.092
I lied.

1:21:39.161 --> 1:21:40.828
I told you, it's going around.

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:41.695
Get in, partner.

1:21:41.763 --> 1:21:44.030
Man, what happened to
"a deal's a deal"?

1:21:44.099 --> 1:21:46.099
You know, you tell a guy
and the next thing you know,

1:21:46.168 --> 1:21:47.901
you're in a Hellcat.

1:21:47.969 --> 1:21:49.270
Shut up.

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:53.307
-Better hurry.
