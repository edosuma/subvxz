¶ ¶

00:09.709 --> 00:11.475
(panting)

00:11.477 --> 00:13.543
(crow cawing)

00:21.452 --> 00:23.518
(panting)

00:36.565 --> 00:39.132
(panting)

00:44.505 --> 00:46.571
Go.

00:52.812 --> 00:54.812
Kate,

00:54.814 --> 00:58.048
You know you're just running
away from yourself.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.816
(gasping)
no.

01:05.623 --> 01:06.688
(whimpers)
no.

01:10.627 --> 01:13.594
(starter turning)
come on, come on. No.

01:13.596 --> 01:15.662
(engine starting)

01:41.756 --> 01:43.422
Have you done
frog's pose?

01:43.424 --> 01:44.756
(grunts)

01:44.758 --> 01:46.758
I've done the crane,
the downward dog,

01:46.760 --> 01:49.093
Cobra the snake, but no,
never done the frog.

01:49.095 --> 01:51.128
Okay, so we're gonna
work deep into the body.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.463
Yep.
Opening our hips.

01:53.465 --> 01:55.465
Opening hips.
By getting into a nice...

01:55.467 --> 01:57.800
Deep... Straddle.

01:57.802 --> 01:59.134
Wow, deep
straddle.

01:59.136 --> 02:00.268
That's a
crowd-pleaser.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.570
(chuckles)
deeks, I warned you.

02:02.572 --> 02:04.171
You know
my work rule.

02:04.173 --> 02:06.239
If you joke, this is over.

02:06.241 --> 02:07.406
What are you talking
about? I'm just saying

02:07.408 --> 02:08.573
That it feels good
to open the hips.

02:08.575 --> 02:11.242
You know, to get
a nice deep straddle...

02:11.244 --> 02:12.643
At work.

02:12.645 --> 02:14.678
Pelvis towards the ground.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.479
I'm putting my pelvis
towards the ground.

02:16.481 --> 02:18.848
Iliac crest as low as it can go.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.583
Not sure what that is.

02:20.585 --> 02:22.818
Clear your mind
and focus on one intention.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.886
One intention.

02:26.222 --> 02:27.487
Deeks?

02:27.489 --> 02:28.488
What?

02:28.490 --> 02:30.340
Focus.

02:30.341 --> 02:32.191
I am, I'm focusing
on your iliac crest.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.193
Maybe you need some help.
No, I don't need any help.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.427
Maybe you do.
No, I feel like I'm
doing pretty good.

02:35.429 --> 02:36.895
I think you do.

02:36.896 --> 02:38.362
I think you
need some help.
Get away from me.

02:38.363 --> 02:39.829
Put your feet together.
My feet are together.
I don't... (shouts)

02:39.833 --> 02:40.832
(kensi chuckles)

02:40.833 --> 02:41.832
Oh, just breathe through it.
Yep.

02:41.835 --> 02:43.335
Just push your hips down.

02:43.336 --> 02:44.836
I don't think man
is supposed to bend like that.

02:44.838 --> 02:46.204
You can go further.

02:46.206 --> 02:48.406
No, I think I just
heard something snap.

02:48.408 --> 02:50.408
Okay, if there's a safe word
in yoga, I'd like to know it,

02:50.410 --> 02:51.742
'cause at this point
I'd like to say it.

02:51.744 --> 02:53.210
You okay?
Ow! Spatula.

02:53.212 --> 02:54.678
Oh, spaghetti! Banana!

02:54.680 --> 02:56.846
Eric: Okay, I hate to interrupt
whatever's going on here,

02:56.848 --> 02:59.148
But you're needed in ops stat--
we have a case.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.816
Perfect.
(shouts)

03:00.818 --> 03:02.150
Let's go.

03:04.354 --> 03:05.353
Oh.

03:05.355 --> 03:06.487
(groans)

03:06.489 --> 03:08.222
Nell:
This is david ramsey.

03:08.224 --> 03:10.224
Oh, he's rocking
a clash t-shirt.

03:10.226 --> 03:11.692
A man after
my own heart.

03:11.694 --> 03:13.660
He's a former
darpa engineer.

03:13.662 --> 03:17.296
He left the dod after his
brother died of leukemia.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.231
He then moved to los angeles

03:19.233 --> 03:20.932
And joined the church
of the unlocked mind.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.767
Those guys.
Granger: Yeah.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.934
Those guys.

03:23.936 --> 03:25.702
All aboard the
crazy train.

03:25.704 --> 03:28.371
Nell: Now, the church's main
headquarters are in los angeles,

03:28.373 --> 03:29.905
But they have branches
all over the world.

03:29.907 --> 03:31.773
The dod wants david tracked

03:31.775 --> 03:34.442
Because they feel he may be
psychologically vulnerable.

03:34.444 --> 03:35.910
And because he knows the secrets

03:35.912 --> 03:38.612
To some of the dod's most
cutting-edge technologies,

03:38.614 --> 03:43.216
Including the extreme accuracy
tasked ordinance, aka exacto,

03:43.218 --> 03:46.185
Aka a .50 caliber guided bullet.

03:46.187 --> 03:48.887
No line of sight needed to
commit an assassination.

03:48.889 --> 03:50.855
Nell: Last night, david's wife,
kate ramsey, escaped

03:50.857 --> 03:53.357
From the church's campus,
and went to the police.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.359
So dod believes
this church is getting

03:55.361 --> 03:57.794
Classified information
from david ramsey.

03:57.796 --> 03:59.796
For what purpose?
It's not clear.

03:59.798 --> 04:03.199
Actually, it might
be coming into focus.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.268
Miss jones,
I just sent you a folder.

04:06.270 --> 04:08.270
Okay.

04:08.272 --> 04:10.872
It seems the defense
intelligence agency

04:10.874 --> 04:12.874
Has identified one of the
church's executive members,

04:12.876 --> 04:16.244
Marlon ammar,
meeting with a dao zhi--

04:16.246 --> 04:18.713
He's a chinese national,
suspected of being a spy.

04:18.715 --> 04:20.648
If david ramsey and the
church of the unlocked mind

04:20.650 --> 04:21.949
Are selling military
intel to china,

04:21.951 --> 04:24.217
We've got a huge problem.

04:24.219 --> 04:25.952
That's to say the least.

04:25.954 --> 04:28.955
Kensi and deeks--
undercover inside the church.

04:28.957 --> 04:30.489
Here we go.

04:30.491 --> 04:32.357
Through the
looking glass.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.726
Find ammar and dao zhi, quickly.

04:34.728 --> 04:37.328
On it.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.729
Hetty: Mr. Callen
and mr. Hanna.

04:38.731 --> 04:40.731
Go talk to kate ramsey.

04:40.733 --> 04:41.998
She's waiting for you.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.265
All righty.

04:47.971 --> 04:49.503
I found out the unlocked mind

04:49.505 --> 04:51.238
Has already filed suit
against me.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.273
For what?

04:53.275 --> 04:56.542
There was this older woman
in the church, barbara.

04:56.544 --> 04:58.644
I thought
I could trust her.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.446
She's able
to come and go.

05:01.448 --> 05:03.448
She has access to one
of the church's cars.

05:03.450 --> 05:04.782
I asked her to help me escape,

05:04.784 --> 05:06.450
And she said she would,
but then...

05:06.452 --> 05:08.251
She double-crossed you.

05:08.253 --> 05:10.720
You hit her, and now
they're suing you.

05:10.722 --> 05:15.257
They ruin people's lives
just to get them not to talk.

05:15.259 --> 05:17.959
How long have you
and david been married?

05:17.961 --> 05:19.493
Five years.

05:19.495 --> 05:21.595
He's the love of my life.

05:21.597 --> 05:23.897
So why did you leave?

05:23.899 --> 05:25.965
Lee ashman.

05:25.967 --> 05:26.966
The head of the church.

05:26.968 --> 05:28.334
Yeah.

05:28.336 --> 05:30.336
He was trying to break us apart.

05:30.338 --> 05:32.304
I don't know why.

05:32.306 --> 05:34.306
I had to get out.

05:34.308 --> 05:37.442
Did they ever ask david
about his work for dod?

05:37.444 --> 05:39.310
I don't know,

05:39.312 --> 05:42.012
But they kept couples separate
for long periods of time.

05:42.014 --> 05:44.848
Can you protect me?

05:44.850 --> 05:46.649
From who?

05:46.651 --> 05:49.484
People have disappeared.

05:51.921 --> 05:54.454
Kate, we're gonna get you
to a safe place.

05:54.456 --> 05:58.423
They're never gonna
let me see david again.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.060
He's all I have.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.934
Now, getting into the church
is easy.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.936
We'll drop you at their center
in santa monica.

06:13.938 --> 06:16.939
Then they'll take you by van
to their main campus in topanga.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.941
The real trick is
getting asked to stay.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.943
Now, they're really big
on these therapy sessions.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.077
They use a setup like this.

06:22.079 --> 06:24.312
It's a laptop
hooked up to a camera.

06:24.314 --> 06:26.647
They'll ask you to reveal
your deepest darkest secrets,

06:26.649 --> 06:29.716
While monitoring any change
in the size of your iris.

06:29.718 --> 06:31.718
Normally, this type of
ocular-movement reader

06:31.720 --> 06:33.720
Uses sophisticated software,

06:33.722 --> 06:36.756
But here they simply have
a "trained" counselor.

06:36.758 --> 06:39.024
Mm.
In other words,
it's all nonsense.

06:39.026 --> 06:41.926
Well, the good news is that
"nonsense" is my middle name.

06:41.928 --> 06:43.928
So go ahead and probe
my inner mind, brother.

06:43.930 --> 06:44.929
Why am I scared?

06:44.931 --> 06:46.430
(clears throat)
(clears throat)

06:46.432 --> 06:48.132
All right.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.833
What was your
first sexual experience?

06:49.835 --> 06:51.734
Oh, wait, hold the probe.

06:51.736 --> 06:53.669
Nell:
Okay, as far as we can tell,

06:53.671 --> 06:55.003
A person's willingness
to reveal themselves

06:55.005 --> 06:57.005
Is the one determining factor
in getting asked to stay

06:57.007 --> 06:59.674
At the church's headquarters,
so... Fess up.

06:59.676 --> 07:01.008
All right,
fair enough.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.409
Uh, there was this girl,
her name was sarah.

07:02.411 --> 07:03.710
We were 16 years old.

07:03.712 --> 07:05.745
And I held her hand
at a party.

07:05.747 --> 07:09.081
It was very romantic, so I went
to her house the next day.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.082
Um...

07:10.084 --> 07:11.550
Keep going.

07:11.552 --> 07:12.817
You sure?

07:12.819 --> 07:14.051
Yes.

07:15.621 --> 07:16.953
Uh, she wasn't home.

07:16.955 --> 07:20.022
But the good news was
that her mom was home.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.823
And she was
sunbathing.

07:21.825 --> 07:24.025
And so she asked me
to put some lotion on her.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.693
And so I'm putting
the lotion on her body...

07:25.695 --> 07:27.428
Nell: La, la, la, la.
Kensi: Oh, oh, tmi.

07:27.430 --> 07:28.562
Flag on the play.
Cannot unhear that.

07:28.564 --> 07:30.063
That was not cool.

07:30.065 --> 07:31.564
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to know.

07:31.566 --> 07:33.499
Is that for real?
Yeah. No.

07:33.501 --> 07:34.833
Well, yes for
the character.

07:34.835 --> 07:36.067
'cause I'm method.

07:36.069 --> 07:38.419
So what you're saying is
it's a fantasy of yours.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.770
No, I'm good at what I do, and
what I do is undercover work.

07:40.773 --> 07:43.406
Undercover work indeed,
mr. Deeks.

07:43.408 --> 07:45.074
Are you seriously
turning into hetty?

07:45.076 --> 07:46.408
'cause you're
freaking me out.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.576
No, no, don't divert
the freak to me.

07:48.578 --> 07:50.878
Yes, it's your freak, mr. Deeks.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.797
Oh.

07:52.798 --> 07:54.715
Did you hear the part about the
stone-cold fox and the lotion?

07:54.717 --> 07:57.517
Every word.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.519
Deeks:
Huh, awkward.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.089
An attorney from the doj
is being sent here

08:03.091 --> 08:05.024
To monitor our investigation

08:05.026 --> 08:07.960
Of the church
of the unlocked mind.

08:07.962 --> 08:10.128
Why would the department
of justice be monitoring us?

08:10.130 --> 08:12.864
You think somebody high at the
doj is a member of the church?

08:12.866 --> 08:15.399
Whatever the motivation,
we need to move quickly.

08:15.401 --> 08:18.535
I want the two of you inside
before he gets here.

08:18.537 --> 08:19.936
On it.
Got it.

08:40.724 --> 08:42.190
Welcome to the church
of the unlocked mind.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.792
I'm adam.
Hey, thanks.

08:44.794 --> 08:47.828
Come inside-- we have some
snacks, something to drink.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.197
Yeah, I could use
a snack, good.

09:01.943 --> 09:03.475
You look a little lost.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.709
Is it that obvious?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.143
(both laugh)
I'm gaia.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.895
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:07.896 --> 09:09.646
Welcome to the best part
of your life.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.748
That sounds really good.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.782
(chuckles)

09:12.784 --> 09:14.450
Come on, let's go inside.

09:14.452 --> 09:15.951
I'll show you around.
Okay.

09:15.953 --> 09:17.519
Thank you.

09:17.521 --> 09:18.987
Gaia.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.989
I'll be right
with you.

09:20.991 --> 09:23.123
Okay.

09:25.994 --> 09:28.194
She's beautiful.

09:28.196 --> 09:30.162
Yes, she is.

09:30.164 --> 09:33.532
See how open she is.

09:33.534 --> 09:35.600
Of course.

09:48.848 --> 09:50.848
Granger:
What do we got?

09:50.850 --> 09:53.183
Well, we discovered
a tell-all book

09:53.185 --> 09:56.553
Written by a former member of
the church of the unlocked mind.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.188
But the book never saw
the light of day because...

09:59.190 --> 10:00.889
The church sued,
preventing its publication.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.391
Eric:
Exactly.

10:02.392 --> 10:03.892
The book talks
about other members.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.994
Now, surprisingly, many
of them were higher-ups

10:05.996 --> 10:08.162
In major manufacturing
and tech firms.

10:08.164 --> 10:09.830
Nell: It seems the church
would target executives

10:09.832 --> 10:11.665
Who were going
through a difficult time--

10:11.667 --> 10:13.667
Divorce, addiction,
family tragedies--

10:13.669 --> 10:15.869
And then lure them
into the church.

10:15.871 --> 10:17.537
So we cross-referenced
prominent members

10:17.539 --> 10:19.005
Against acts
of corporate espionage

10:19.007 --> 10:20.773
Committed against
their former companies.

10:20.775 --> 10:23.008
And all the companies had
stolen technologies.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.642
Yeah.
Exactly.

10:24.644 --> 10:26.744
They get the info
from the therapy sessions.

10:26.746 --> 10:28.078
Then sell it
to rival corporations.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.613
Now with david ramsey,
it seems they've moved up

10:30.615 --> 10:32.681
To stealing
u.S. Military secrets.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.616
Get me kensi and deeks.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.651
(beeps)
you're on.

10:38.653 --> 10:40.786
Callen: Kensi, deeks,
can you talk?

10:40.788 --> 10:43.121
How long do these
therapy sessions take?

10:43.123 --> 10:44.789
Depends on how
open you are.

10:44.791 --> 10:45.856
Hmm.

10:45.858 --> 10:46.857
All right, look, just listen.

10:46.859 --> 10:48.725
The point of these
therapy sessions

10:48.727 --> 10:50.827
Is to get information
that they can use or sell.

10:50.829 --> 10:52.161
So make sure you give them
something good.

10:52.163 --> 10:53.695
I'm gonna be so open.

10:53.697 --> 10:55.763
Like an all-night diner.

10:55.765 --> 10:57.564
I think you guys may
be my last shot.

10:57.566 --> 10:59.632
So, gaia, how long
have you been a member?

10:59.634 --> 11:01.100
Oh, I grew up
in the church.
Oh.

11:01.102 --> 11:03.635
My parents joined
when I was 12.

11:03.637 --> 11:06.104
I grew up in the church
of beverly hills.

11:06.106 --> 11:10.108
Prayed at the altar
of fame, pain and cocaine.

11:10.110 --> 11:11.709
Right in here.

11:11.711 --> 11:13.844
Thank you.

11:13.846 --> 11:16.613
Wow.

11:18.049 --> 11:19.615
Adam:
<i> Okay.</i>

11:20.584 --> 11:22.850
Nothing should
cloud your mind.

11:22.852 --> 11:25.886
All fears and secrets
are barriers

11:25.888 --> 11:28.321
To freedom, joy and peace.

11:28.323 --> 11:30.890
Okay.

11:30.892 --> 11:32.658
Nothing should
cloud your mind.

11:32.660 --> 11:33.892
All fears

11:33.894 --> 11:35.560
And secrets are barriers

11:35.562 --> 11:38.896
To freedom, joy and peace.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.832
I don't think I know
what those are.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.600
I understand.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.135
Don't be afraid.

11:46.137 --> 11:48.837
My, uh, my parents were taking
my kid brother to college,

11:48.839 --> 11:51.139
And, uh,

11:51.141 --> 11:53.674
They were hit head-on
by a drunk driver.

11:53.676 --> 11:55.709
Hmm.

11:55.711 --> 11:57.810
Go deeper.

12:00.848 --> 12:03.849
When I started doing meth,

12:03.851 --> 12:06.685
My dad stopped
sending me money.

12:06.687 --> 12:08.887
And, um,

12:08.889 --> 12:11.823
My acting career
was going down really fast.

12:11.825 --> 12:13.791
I was sleeping
with studio execs

12:13.793 --> 12:14.958
And directors
for parts.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.159
Who did you sleep with?

12:16.161 --> 12:18.995
You need to be specific.

12:18.997 --> 12:20.896
I'm sorry, you want,
like, names?

12:20.898 --> 12:23.765
<i> I</i> don't want anything.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.700
Except for your mind
to be at peace

12:25.702 --> 12:27.234
And for you to reach
your full potential

12:27.236 --> 12:29.169
As a human being.

12:30.906 --> 12:34.607
Okay, um...

12:34.609 --> 12:36.875
(chuckles)
j.J. Reynolds.

12:36.877 --> 12:38.309
Um...

12:38.311 --> 12:40.010
Michael peters.

12:40.012 --> 12:41.044
<i> The</i> michael peters?

12:41.046 --> 12:42.979
That is just
the beginning.

12:42.981 --> 12:44.481
I slept with

12:44.482 --> 12:45.982
And did drugs with
the governor of california.

12:45.984 --> 12:48.651
Keep going.

12:48.653 --> 12:50.853
Each memory is a secret

12:50.855 --> 12:52.988
That impedes.

12:52.990 --> 12:56.725
So you need to recall it
in as much detail as possible.

12:56.727 --> 12:58.093
So...

12:58.095 --> 13:01.029
Which governor
did you sleep with?

13:01.031 --> 13:03.865
Adam:
<i> You need to recount</i>

13:03.867 --> 13:06.234
Each memory,
each secret,

13:06.236 --> 13:08.903
In as much detail
as you can recall.

13:08.905 --> 13:10.938
Oh, man, my whole life
is secrets.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.940
All of us carry that burden.

13:12.942 --> 13:15.375
No, no, no,
I don't think you get it.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.243
You know brae computer?

13:17.245 --> 13:19.378
Corley software?

13:19.380 --> 13:21.246
Tokisha gaming?

13:21.248 --> 13:23.014
Lockner and ryan aeronautics?

13:23.016 --> 13:24.882
You know them?
Yes.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.284
Yeah, well, I designed all their
computer security systems.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.185
(quiet laugh)

13:29.187 --> 13:32.421
Well, that is a burden,
my friend.

13:35.426 --> 13:37.692
(low conversations)

13:46.235 --> 13:49.069
Hey.

13:49.071 --> 13:50.970
You, uh, a fan of the clash?

13:50.972 --> 13:52.671
Love them.

13:52.673 --> 13:54.139
Uh, marty riverton.

13:54.141 --> 13:55.440
David.

13:55.442 --> 13:57.742
It was actually
my brother's favorite band.

13:57.744 --> 13:59.143
He got me into them.

13:59.145 --> 14:00.344
"was"?

14:00.346 --> 14:01.878
Uh, he just passed.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.145
Leukemia.

14:03.147 --> 14:05.046
I'm sorry.

14:05.048 --> 14:06.047
Don't be.

14:06.049 --> 14:08.049
That was a good memory.

14:08.051 --> 14:10.951
Yeah, my, uh,

14:10.953 --> 14:13.053
Brother actually
passed away, too.

14:13.055 --> 14:14.687
Three years ago.

14:14.689 --> 14:17.322
Let's gather around, friends.
Gather around.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.991
Uh, we'll, uh, we'll catch up,
we'll hang.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.225
Sure thing.
Nice to meet you.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.276
Gaia:
Come on, everyone,

14:22.277 --> 14:23.326
Let's gather around
the fountain.

14:27.065 --> 14:29.365
I'm lee.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.400
Others:
Hi, lee.

14:31.402 --> 14:33.235
Welcome...

14:33.237 --> 14:35.837
To the best part of your life.

14:35.839 --> 14:38.739
We have so much to talk about
and show you,

14:38.741 --> 14:41.308
But we are gonna start
with something new.

14:41.310 --> 14:44.377
A ceremony which marks
your rebirth

14:44.379 --> 14:48.214
Into a life of honesty

14:48.216 --> 14:50.049
And potential,

14:50.051 --> 14:52.317
Devoid of secrets

14:52.319 --> 14:54.919
And lies and stress.

14:54.921 --> 14:58.022
We have bathrobes for you
and bathing suits.

14:58.024 --> 15:01.925
So, meet us at the pool,
because today...

15:01.927 --> 15:04.427
You're gonna be reborn.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.932
(low chatter)

15:12.068 --> 15:15.069
You still have
your earwig in?

15:15.071 --> 15:17.004
No, I stashed it in
my locker. Do you?

15:17.006 --> 15:18.372
Yeah, a guy was next to me
the whole entire time.

15:18.374 --> 15:19.873
I couldn't take it out.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.074
Eric:
The system's closed circuit.

15:21.076 --> 15:23.042
I've got no cameras
to see anything.

15:23.044 --> 15:24.510
Deeks, if you go under
for any length of time,

15:24.512 --> 15:25.978
We're gonna lose
your connection.

15:25.980 --> 15:27.279
Yeah, I realize that.

15:27.281 --> 15:28.947
Hopefully it's
just a quick dip.

15:28.949 --> 15:30.882
You don't like the water?

15:30.884 --> 15:32.149
Oh, uh, no.

15:32.151 --> 15:34.784
I just, as a kid,
I almost drowned.

15:34.786 --> 15:37.153
So, hopefully they don't
put my head underwater.

15:37.155 --> 15:38.420
It's a fear.

15:38.422 --> 15:39.788
We should work on that.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.856
Let's head
to the shallow end.

15:46.495 --> 15:48.995
Ashman:
To the freedom
of an unlocked mind.

15:48.997 --> 15:52.965
Freedom given to us
by our ancestors.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.433
Those great spirits

15:54.435 --> 15:57.169
Who continue to live
inside of us.

15:57.171 --> 15:58.303
You okay staying in?

15:58.305 --> 15:59.804
Deeks:
Yeah, we're good.

15:59.806 --> 16:01.906
I made contact with david.

16:01.908 --> 16:03.340
I think I can get
him out of here.

16:03.342 --> 16:05.375
(quietly):
What's his name?

16:05.377 --> 16:06.943
Martin.

16:06.945 --> 16:08.444
Please, kensi, martin,

16:08.446 --> 16:10.512
Join us.

16:20.489 --> 16:23.189
Come, a new life awaits.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.558
All the joy
that you ever imagined

16:25.560 --> 16:28.827
Is within your grasp.

16:28.829 --> 16:31.129
Deeks:
So, I, uh,

16:31.131 --> 16:33.097
I really do freak out
underwater.

16:33.099 --> 16:35.532
Trust, love, clarity of thought.

16:35.534 --> 16:37.400
Just lean back, martin.

16:37.402 --> 16:39.034
Lean back.

16:39.036 --> 16:40.802
Face your fears.

16:46.075 --> 16:48.175
We lost him.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.179
(grunting)

16:57.150 --> 16:58.582
(grunting)

17:00.085 --> 17:01.818
What are you doing?
You know him?

17:01.820 --> 17:03.553
No, I don't, but he's
obviously in trouble!
All right.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.887
(grunting)

17:04.889 --> 17:06.605
Ashman:
It's okay, it's all right.

17:06.606 --> 17:08.322
Let him out of the water.
It's all right, it's normal.

17:08.325 --> 17:10.391
Get him out!
It's normal, it's...

17:10.393 --> 17:12.192
Don't worry,
it's part of the process.

17:16.164 --> 17:18.130
You faced your fear.

17:18.132 --> 17:19.965
Feel the joy
in your heart.

17:19.967 --> 17:23.001
It's one of life's
greatest lessons.

17:23.003 --> 17:26.204
Welcome to the church
of the unlocked mind.

17:26.206 --> 17:28.272
(applause, whistling)

17:49.494 --> 17:51.293
(door closes)

17:51.295 --> 17:54.629
Agents callen and
hanna, as promised,

17:54.631 --> 17:56.263
Ausa oscar guevara.

17:56.265 --> 17:57.530
Oscar.

17:57.532 --> 17:59.231
So what is, uh,

17:59.233 --> 18:02.167
What's doj's interest
in this case?

18:02.169 --> 18:04.469
The church of the unlocked mind
is an extremely

18:04.471 --> 18:06.437
Well-funded
and litigious organization.

18:06.439 --> 18:10.274
Any time even a small
investigation begins,

18:10.276 --> 18:12.643
They have each member
individually bring suit.

18:12.645 --> 18:15.646
The way scientology
did with the irs?

18:15.648 --> 18:19.149
Exactly. Now that's hundreds
of simultaneous lawsuits.

18:19.151 --> 18:20.950
Completely overwhelming
the federal courts.

18:20.952 --> 18:22.651
So what do you want from us?

18:22.653 --> 18:24.052
Do not poke this bear.

18:24.054 --> 18:26.454
If you have something,
bring it to us.

18:26.456 --> 18:28.556
If we determine there's a case,
you can proceed.

18:28.558 --> 18:31.959
And most importantly,
do not put agents undercover

18:31.961 --> 18:34.594
Inside the church
of the unlocked mind.

18:34.596 --> 18:35.928
Well, it's a little late
for that.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.896
We have people in there already.

18:37.898 --> 18:39.063
Pull them out now.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.531
We've lost communication
with them.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.900
Besides, this is a breach
of national security.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.401
Marlon ammar,

18:44.403 --> 18:45.635
He's a long-standing member
of the church,

18:45.637 --> 18:48.137
Was meeting
with a suspected chinese spy.

18:48.139 --> 18:50.539
You think the unlocked mind
is selling dod intelligence.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.507
What proof do you have?

18:52.509 --> 18:55.142
This seems like a good point
to interrupt.

18:55.144 --> 18:58.211
I've picked up communication
between ammar and dao zhi.

18:58.213 --> 19:00.680
A meeting place has been set
between the two.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.583
Ammar and the chinese spy
had met once already.

19:04.585 --> 19:06.251
It means the deal isn't done.

19:06.253 --> 19:07.685
We can still stop the sale.

19:07.687 --> 19:09.486
Callen:
So what do you think?

19:09.488 --> 19:11.621
Ready to poke this bear?

19:13.124 --> 19:15.157
Address of the ammar-zhi meet,
it's on your phones.

19:15.159 --> 19:17.959
Sam, I'll stay here
with our doj friend.

19:17.961 --> 19:20.227
Sam:
I'll take nell
and head to the meet.

19:20.229 --> 19:22.362
Can't be in two places at once.

19:27.602 --> 19:29.602
(door opens)

19:46.954 --> 19:48.520
Kensi?

19:48.522 --> 19:50.022
Hi.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.523
Why don't you leave your clothes
here and come with me?

19:51.525 --> 19:53.057
Where are we going?

19:53.059 --> 19:54.525
There's a group of women
I'd like you to meet.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.359
It'll be fun.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.427
Okay.
Come on.

20:05.669 --> 20:07.368
Hey.

20:07.370 --> 20:08.969
Hi.

20:08.971 --> 20:10.136
What are you up to?

20:10.138 --> 20:11.971
Work.

20:11.973 --> 20:15.140
Work clears the mind.

20:15.142 --> 20:16.441
Yeah, they're sending me
to the dining hall.

20:16.443 --> 20:18.176
Evidently they need
a dishwasher.

20:18.178 --> 20:20.178
What exactly
are you doing?

20:20.180 --> 20:22.480
Lee wants us to pick up
all the rocks in this field.

20:22.482 --> 20:25.483
Those rocks look
like gravel.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.052
How do you think
they got here?

20:28.054 --> 20:29.987
You don't question the work.

20:29.989 --> 20:33.190
If you question,
you can't clear the pathways.

20:33.192 --> 20:36.059
And why do you need
to clear the pathways?

20:36.061 --> 20:37.693
Today?

20:38.662 --> 20:41.362
My wife left me.

20:42.331 --> 20:44.331
I see.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.167
Now, did she leave you or
did she leave the church?

20:47.169 --> 20:49.202
My life is the study

20:49.204 --> 20:51.204
Of the unlocked mind's
teachings.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.506
I can't cope outside
without it.

20:53.508 --> 20:56.041
She knew that.

20:56.043 --> 20:57.709
Is that what
lee ashman thinks?

20:57.711 --> 20:59.510
That she abandoned you?

21:00.479 --> 21:03.046
Yeah.

21:03.048 --> 21:04.447
You know what I think?

21:04.449 --> 21:06.782
I think lee ashman
put these rocks here,

21:06.784 --> 21:09.217
Just so you'd have to come
out here and pick them up.

21:09.219 --> 21:11.185
That thought
has crossed my mind.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.054
It's good to
question things.

21:14.056 --> 21:16.056
You know that, right?

21:16.058 --> 21:19.259
But if you question,
if you open that door,

21:19.261 --> 21:20.793
It lets all
the other thoughts in.

21:20.795 --> 21:22.427
Yeah, thoughts
about your brother.

21:24.564 --> 21:26.363
You had a thought about
your brother this morning,

21:26.365 --> 21:28.198
And that was a good memory.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.266
Yeah.

21:30.268 --> 21:32.668
I miss him.

21:32.670 --> 21:35.537
I miss my wife.

21:35.539 --> 21:37.071
I don't even know
if she's okay.

21:37.073 --> 21:38.539
Then you need to be with her.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.208
You want me to
help you do that?

21:45.779 --> 21:48.112
Hey, david.

21:48.114 --> 21:49.613
Come with me.

21:49.615 --> 21:51.081
Where we going?

21:51.083 --> 21:53.183
D.A., now.

22:00.091 --> 22:01.723
Hey.

22:01.725 --> 22:04.225
You know what the d.A. Is?

22:05.595 --> 22:07.428
It's the discipline arena.

22:12.434 --> 22:14.667
Oh, thank you.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.070
Hey, all.

22:19.072 --> 22:22.106
This is kensi.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.740
Hi. Heather.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.108
Crystal.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.275
Hi.

22:26.277 --> 22:27.276
Come.

22:27.278 --> 22:30.112
Sit.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.214
Kensi was
just reborn.

22:32.216 --> 22:33.548
Oh, rebecca,

22:33.550 --> 22:35.182
Can we get
another glass?

22:35.184 --> 22:37.083
Sure.

22:37.085 --> 22:38.584
Welcome to the best
part of your life.

22:38.586 --> 22:40.118
Say good-bye
to anxiety

22:40.120 --> 22:41.152
And fear.

22:41.154 --> 22:42.186
Amen to that.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.420
(laughter)

22:43.422 --> 22:44.754
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

22:44.756 --> 22:45.755
I have issues with alcohol.

22:45.757 --> 22:46.756
No, thank you.

22:46.758 --> 22:48.424
Not here, you don't.

22:48.426 --> 22:51.593
Addiction
is an illness.

22:51.595 --> 22:54.429
You choose
your illness.

22:54.431 --> 22:56.464
Simply don't
choose it.

22:56.466 --> 22:58.666
So you're saying I-I can drink?

22:58.668 --> 23:00.868
It's an enjoyable
part of life.

23:00.870 --> 23:03.603
That's why we're
here, isn't it?

23:05.740 --> 23:07.773
I guess so.

23:07.775 --> 23:09.174
Heather:
A toast.

23:09.176 --> 23:10.642
To rebirth

23:10.644 --> 23:13.277
And the ecstasy
that awaits.

23:13.279 --> 23:15.445
I'm ready for you now.

23:15.447 --> 23:18.480
Oh, speaking of ecstasy.

23:20.417 --> 23:22.216
You get massaged
by the other women?

23:22.218 --> 23:23.850
Every day.

23:25.286 --> 23:27.386
Having somebody put
their hands on you

23:27.388 --> 23:31.223
Is one of the most...
Glorious feelings on earth.

23:31.225 --> 23:32.557
Would you like one?

23:32.559 --> 23:34.292
You can have

23:34.294 --> 23:35.660
Two women if you want.

23:37.463 --> 23:39.162
Okay. What about two men?

23:39.164 --> 23:40.863
No. No men.
No?

23:40.865 --> 23:42.164
Lee likes

23:42.166 --> 23:43.365
To keep us separate.

23:43.367 --> 23:45.200
As you move up

23:45.202 --> 23:47.168
The strata of awareness,

23:47.170 --> 23:49.370
There are perks.

23:50.806 --> 23:53.139
To the best part
of your life.

24:08.188 --> 24:10.688
Man (muffled):
Simon says touch your toes.

24:10.690 --> 24:13.157
Simon says
pat your belly.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.292
Simon says pull your ear.

24:15.294 --> 24:16.893
(knocking)

24:16.895 --> 24:19.228
Simon says
raise your hands.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.462
What?

24:20.464 --> 24:21.629
Uh, lee ashman said

24:21.631 --> 24:22.796
I needed to come down here.

24:22.798 --> 24:24.731
Come play.

24:24.733 --> 24:26.799
Man:
Let go. Good.

24:26.801 --> 24:29.168
Remember,
first five out

24:29.170 --> 24:31.803
Are exiles.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.337
Join in.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.240
Simon says hands on your hips.

24:38.943 --> 24:40.375
Simon says hands on knees.

24:41.678 --> 24:44.211
Simon says stand on one foot.

24:44.213 --> 24:45.745
Touch your face.

24:45.747 --> 24:47.480
Michael, you moved.

24:47.482 --> 24:48.514
Out.

24:48.516 --> 24:49.681
Bill touched his face.

24:49.683 --> 24:51.649
I'm not getting
kicked out when he did it.

24:51.651 --> 24:52.850
Worry about yourself.

24:52.852 --> 24:54.318
Yeah? Go to hell.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.385
(grunting)

24:56.755 --> 24:57.920
Bill: You're out!
Michael: No!

24:59.223 --> 25:00.222
Let's go.

25:00.224 --> 25:01.256
You're out!

25:01.258 --> 25:03.524
Michael:
No!

25:03.526 --> 25:05.192
(michael grunting)

25:05.194 --> 25:07.360
Go wait in your room, michael.

25:13.267 --> 25:18.269
Who's worthy of the joy of
the church of the unlocked mind?

25:19.238 --> 25:21.371
Simon says cover your eyes.

25:22.273 --> 25:24.239
Simon says cover your ears.

25:24.241 --> 25:25.406
Simon says slap yourself.

25:26.575 --> 25:28.474
Simon says again.

25:28.476 --> 25:30.342
Harder!

25:31.311 --> 25:33.244
Gotcha.

25:47.326 --> 25:49.259
We've now identified
six members

25:49.261 --> 25:50.660
Of the church
of the unlocked mind

25:50.662 --> 25:52.595
Who cannot
be accounted for.

25:52.597 --> 25:55.264
They left and now there's no
public record of them anywhere.

25:55.266 --> 25:57.332
That's not good with kensi
and deeks out of communication.

25:57.334 --> 25:59.500
We should put
another agent inside.

25:59.502 --> 26:00.667
Guevara:
No.

26:00.669 --> 26:02.502
Not unless we get
something solid

26:02.504 --> 26:03.903
From the ammar-dao zhi meet.

26:03.905 --> 26:06.405
We're talking about
protecting our people here.

26:06.407 --> 26:08.440
Right now we have no idea what's
going on inside that compound.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.376
You want to go in
as a family member,

26:11.378 --> 26:13.644
Ask to meet them,
pull 'em out, fine,

26:13.646 --> 26:15.912
But you're not putting
any more agents inside.

26:15.914 --> 26:18.481
Eric:
Excuse me, but that won't work.

26:18.483 --> 26:20.883
The church never allows
outsiders to see members.

26:20.885 --> 26:22.851
They won't even acknowledge
they're on the property.

26:22.853 --> 26:24.652
Then I'm sending in
another agent.

26:24.654 --> 26:26.854
You do that,
I'll go see a federal judge,

26:26.856 --> 26:28.755
Get a court order,
shut you down.

26:28.757 --> 26:31.324
You should do
your homework,

26:31.326 --> 26:32.758
Make some calls
about me.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.259
What are you talking about?

26:34.261 --> 26:36.261
I'm not the guy
you cross like that.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.962
(eric clears throat)

26:37.964 --> 26:39.964
I've got, uh,
sam and nell on speaker.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.665
Sam:
We're at the meet site.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.533
Ammar just arrived.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.535
There's no sign
of dao zhi.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.003
You guys get in contact
with kensi or deeks?

26:47.005 --> 26:48.004
Callen:
No.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.939
But we're headed over there now.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.357
Granger:
He shows up,

26:51.358 --> 26:52.774
They make the exchange,
you bust 'em.

26:52.777 --> 26:53.976
Copy that.

26:53.978 --> 26:56.278
I'm going with you.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.379
You have no choice.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.015
Could get dangerous.

27:12.393 --> 27:14.393
You're hiding
something.

27:14.395 --> 27:17.362
Your involuntary movements
are all over the place.

27:17.364 --> 27:19.564
I don't have a secret
I haven't told you.

27:19.566 --> 27:21.299
Really?

27:21.301 --> 27:22.800
What about kate
running away last night?

27:22.802 --> 27:24.535
What about it?

27:24.537 --> 27:26.470
Did you help her?
David:
No.

27:26.472 --> 27:29.406
She wanted to leave
and I told her I wasn't ready.

27:29.408 --> 27:31.408
Meaning you were getting ready
to leave the church?

27:31.410 --> 27:32.909
No.

27:32.911 --> 27:34.810
You're lying, david.

27:34.812 --> 27:36.444
Trevor:
He's lying.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.312
You can tell.

27:38.314 --> 27:39.980
You were making
such good progress.

27:39.982 --> 27:41.715
Now you're regressing.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.349
I'm not lying.

27:49.456 --> 27:50.654
Ow.

27:53.725 --> 27:55.424
Come here.

27:55.426 --> 27:57.492
(crying)

27:58.995 --> 28:00.928
Just trying to shock it
out of you.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.396
You're okay.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.967
He's shut down.

28:06.968 --> 28:09.535
You're gonna have to start
opening the channels a little.

28:14.743 --> 28:16.576
Let's take a break.

28:16.578 --> 28:18.511
Okay.

28:18.513 --> 28:21.380
There's some soda and crackers
on the table.

28:23.417 --> 28:25.483
(low conversations)

28:35.961 --> 28:37.527
You okay?

28:40.131 --> 28:42.431
Well, he's right about
one thing: You were lying.

28:42.433 --> 28:44.132
You do want
to leave here.

28:44.134 --> 28:46.134
No.

28:47.837 --> 28:50.103
I know where kate is
and I can take you to her.

28:55.476 --> 28:56.475
Who are you?

28:56.477 --> 28:58.410
It doesn't matter
who I am.

28:58.412 --> 28:59.577
The only thing that matters

28:59.579 --> 29:02.580
Is this isn't healthy
and you know that.

29:02.582 --> 29:04.415
David, look at me.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.750
This is manipulative
and destructive.

29:06.752 --> 29:08.151
These people
are using you.

29:08.153 --> 29:09.886
You know that.

29:11.155 --> 29:13.421
Now you say the word

29:13.423 --> 29:15.856
And I'll get us out of here.

29:17.492 --> 29:18.557
(quietly):
They'll stop you.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.526
Who, those three guys?

29:22.528 --> 29:24.094
Aw, david, don't worry
about those three guys.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.595
I got that.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.663
You don't understand.

29:27.665 --> 29:29.031
If you fight back,

29:29.033 --> 29:30.165
The others are told to attack.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.534
You try and leave,

29:32.536 --> 29:34.536
Every man in here

29:34.538 --> 29:35.770
Will turn against you.

29:37.507 --> 29:39.840
Everybody
gather around.

29:39.842 --> 29:41.908
David... What do you say
we get real for a little bit?

29:41.910 --> 29:43.109
Come on.

29:43.111 --> 29:45.111
Come on.

29:45.113 --> 29:46.712
You can really get us
out of here?

29:46.714 --> 29:48.547
Absolutely.

29:48.549 --> 29:49.481
David...

29:49.483 --> 29:50.599
Come on.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.716
You're being rude
to everybody here.

29:55.988 --> 29:57.454
Come on.

30:13.504 --> 30:15.570
Callen:
Let me guess.

30:15.572 --> 30:17.071
Fbi.

30:17.073 --> 30:18.739
My people.

30:20.476 --> 30:22.709
Eric, we in the right place?

30:22.711 --> 30:24.177
Uh, that's as close
as you're gonna get.

30:24.179 --> 30:25.778
About three-quarters of a mile
through the woods,

30:25.780 --> 30:27.212
You'll be at the west side
of the campus.

30:27.214 --> 30:28.680
(phone ringing)

30:28.682 --> 30:29.681
Yeah.

30:29.683 --> 30:30.715
Sam:
Okay, put me on speaker

30:30.717 --> 30:32.516
So guevara can hear this.

30:32.518 --> 30:34.217
Dao zhi just arrived.

30:34.219 --> 30:35.751
He's carrying a duffle bag

30:35.753 --> 30:38.086
That could be large enough
for a cash payment.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.088
Nell:
Yeah, and I bet ammar's carrying
a thumb drive.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.090
Guevara:
Fine.

30:42.091 --> 30:44.091
Just make sure you wait
for the exchange.

30:46.062 --> 30:48.529
They're moving into
the parking structure.

30:48.531 --> 30:49.930
Stay with them.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.598
Let us know as
soon as you take 'em.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.499
Yep.

30:55.503 --> 30:57.536
There's a...

30:57.538 --> 30:59.771
Closeness here.

30:59.773 --> 31:01.539
Like sisters.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.674
Hmm.

31:04.710 --> 31:08.712
And, uh, who-who pays
for all of this?

31:08.714 --> 31:11.481
The church of the unlocked mind

31:11.483 --> 31:13.549
Has income sources.

31:13.551 --> 31:15.517
(distantly):
Lee takes care of all of that.

31:15.519 --> 31:17.585
We don't have
to worry about it.

31:18.854 --> 31:21.921
He's really wonderful.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.123
Um...

31:24.125 --> 31:26.758
I'm sorry, I...

31:26.760 --> 31:29.694
I-I need to use
the restroom.

31:29.696 --> 31:31.762
Um...

31:32.765 --> 31:35.565
(clears throat)
um, if you...

31:39.203 --> 31:40.535
It'll be fine.

31:40.537 --> 31:42.637
Don't fight it.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.739
It's okay.

31:44.741 --> 31:48.609
You... Are loved.

31:55.216 --> 31:56.215
Nell:
Eric...

31:56.217 --> 31:57.883
We have any idea
where they went?

31:57.885 --> 31:59.684
Only three cameras are working.

31:59.686 --> 32:01.285
They-they walked
into the north staircase,

32:01.287 --> 32:02.786
But I don't know
what floor the went to.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.554
Sam, you still don't have them?

32:04.556 --> 32:05.655
Sam:
Ah, they're here somewhere.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.889
All right.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.090
I'll head up,
you cover the entrance

32:08.092 --> 32:09.658
In case I miss 'em.

32:11.228 --> 32:13.895
¶ ¶

32:24.540 --> 32:26.039
She's opening her eyes.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.840
Should we
give her more?

32:27.842 --> 32:29.308
No, no, no, no.

32:29.310 --> 32:32.778
She should experience
her awakening.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.112
Mm.

32:36.149 --> 32:38.315
Welcome to the family,

32:38.317 --> 32:41.318
My beautiful girl.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.159
Last night...

32:51.161 --> 32:52.860
She didn't mention anything,

32:52.862 --> 32:53.827
You just woke up

32:53.829 --> 32:55.928
And she was gone.
Yeah.

32:59.133 --> 33:01.133
I hate doing that, david.

33:01.135 --> 33:03.301
But we're not buying it.

33:03.303 --> 33:05.569
You said
she wanted out.

33:05.571 --> 33:07.337
Now tell the damn truth.

33:11.576 --> 33:13.342
I want out.

33:13.344 --> 33:15.077
I want my wife.

33:16.713 --> 33:18.045
You're giving up.

33:18.047 --> 33:19.813
You're gonna be an exile.

33:19.814 --> 33:21.580
And it's gonna be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.883
Get up, david,
and walk out that door.

33:23.885 --> 33:25.284
I'm a federal agent,
and we're leaving.

33:25.286 --> 33:27.819
Anyone that tries to stop us
is gonna be interfering

33:27.821 --> 33:28.953
With a federal
investigation.

33:28.955 --> 33:30.054
He's not going anywhere.

33:31.023 --> 33:32.355
David,

33:32.357 --> 33:34.890
You're going to sit back down
and get honest.

33:34.892 --> 33:36.825
Deeks:
David, look at me.

33:42.131 --> 33:43.730
David, let's go.

33:45.734 --> 33:48.201
Come on, david, this is
your chance. Let's go.

33:52.907 --> 33:54.840
David!

34:07.620 --> 34:09.386
Listen, I don't want
to hurt anybody.

34:09.388 --> 34:10.720
Get him.

34:10.722 --> 34:11.887
Go for his neck!

34:11.889 --> 34:14.189
(grunting)

34:29.206 --> 34:30.138
David.

34:30.140 --> 34:31.906
Nice with the soda can.

34:31.908 --> 34:33.173
Let's go.

34:37.645 --> 34:39.711
We got runners.

34:45.151 --> 34:47.384
When this is over,

34:47.386 --> 34:51.087
You'll be part of us.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.190
Then all the passages to
happiness will be open.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.127
(groaning)

34:59.129 --> 35:01.195
(gaia groaning)

35:04.200 --> 35:06.266
Where's my robe?

35:09.070 --> 35:10.402
I haven't found them.

35:10.404 --> 35:12.270
And you're sure they
haven't left the garage?

35:12.272 --> 35:14.138
No, they're here.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.373
Probably saw us and got scared
and got in a car somewhere.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.109
Just give me a little more time.

35:36.361 --> 35:39.362
Guys... Guys, I've been drugged.

35:39.364 --> 35:41.364
Eric, nell, I need help.

35:41.366 --> 35:43.332
Callen, did you hear that?

35:43.334 --> 35:44.466
On it, we're going in.

35:44.468 --> 35:47.168
No, you're not.

35:47.170 --> 35:48.435
(whistles)

35:48.437 --> 35:50.437
(cell phone rings)

35:50.439 --> 35:52.405
Do not let these men move.

35:52.407 --> 35:54.006
Tell me something good.

35:54.008 --> 35:55.440
We got 'em.

35:55.442 --> 35:57.442
Say that again, hold on,
you're on speaker.

35:57.444 --> 35:59.444
We have ammar
and zhi in custody.

35:59.446 --> 36:01.479
Execute the extraction.

36:03.416 --> 36:05.349
We can use your help.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.219
And you stay the hell
out of our way.

36:13.457 --> 36:15.323
You didn't find
'em, did you?

36:15.325 --> 36:17.892
No.

36:17.894 --> 36:20.794
(sighs)

36:20.796 --> 36:23.396
Hey.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.398
You guys stay right here.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.309
Here, let's go.

36:37.311 --> 36:38.943
Okay, who needs one?

36:38.945 --> 36:39.944
Come with me.

36:39.946 --> 36:40.945
You're following me.

36:40.947 --> 36:42.212
Don't just run off.

36:42.214 --> 36:43.413
All right, stay close.

36:49.887 --> 36:51.286
Go.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.456
(yells)

36:55.458 --> 36:57.524
Where's kensi?
Leave me alone!

36:57.526 --> 36:59.125
I'm a federal agent, you
want to spend the rest

36:59.127 --> 37:00.259
Of your life in prison?
Where is she?

37:00.261 --> 37:02.261
Upstairs.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.962
Kensi!

37:05.031 --> 37:06.497
Kens!

37:06.499 --> 37:08.365
Oh, what happened?

37:08.367 --> 37:09.499
I was drugged.

37:09.501 --> 37:11.033
Can you walk?
I need help.

37:11.035 --> 37:12.067
Is there another
way out of here?

37:12.069 --> 37:13.068
Yeah.

37:13.070 --> 37:14.069
Grab her.

37:14.071 --> 37:15.070
One, two, three, up.

37:15.072 --> 37:16.805
Here we go,
here we go.

37:21.111 --> 37:22.844
Deeks:
All right, we got you.

37:24.547 --> 37:26.980
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

37:26.982 --> 37:28.982
All right, all right,
we got you.

37:28.984 --> 37:30.350
Ooh, ooh.

37:30.352 --> 37:32.552
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

37:33.955 --> 37:35.955
Hold on. Okay, go.

37:35.957 --> 37:37.957
I need to take one
of them out and get his gun.

37:37.959 --> 37:38.958
Okay.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.292
Shh, stay here.

37:40.294 --> 37:41.960
Stay here.

37:41.962 --> 37:42.961
Okay?

37:42.963 --> 37:44.028
Yeah.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.932
(grunting)

37:51.235 --> 37:53.535
(bone cracking)
(groans)

37:53.537 --> 37:55.336
Get up.

37:55.338 --> 37:57.805
How's that for your
spiritual awakening?

37:57.807 --> 37:59.173
You're not getting
out of here.

37:59.175 --> 38:01.041
You shut your mouth.

38:01.043 --> 38:02.375
Kensi, david,
let's go.

38:02.377 --> 38:03.376
Keep it shut.

38:03.378 --> 38:04.377
Move.

38:04.379 --> 38:05.444
Move.

38:09.883 --> 38:11.515
Deeks:
Move.

38:11.517 --> 38:12.700
Oh, oh, oh.

38:12.701 --> 38:13.884
You're not getting out of here.

38:13.886 --> 38:15.886
All you guys do
is repeat each other.

38:15.888 --> 38:18.321
Oh, that's right,
you're in a cult.

38:18.323 --> 38:19.855
Put down the gun.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.224
Her life for his.

38:26.528 --> 38:27.560
Put it down.

38:30.565 --> 38:31.997
Now!

38:31.999 --> 38:33.198
Deeks.

38:33.199 --> 38:34.398
Okay, all right,
all right, relax.

38:34.401 --> 38:36.434
It's going down.

38:36.436 --> 38:37.835
Relax.

38:39.438 --> 38:42.005
Trevor,
get the truck.

38:42.007 --> 38:44.340
Bring the barrels and the lye.

38:44.342 --> 38:46.875
I guess this is the peace,
love and joy part.

38:48.078 --> 38:49.477
What are you doing?

38:49.479 --> 38:54.181
You're about to leave
our reality plane, david.

38:54.183 --> 38:56.583
Welcome to my
reality plane.

38:57.586 --> 39:00.353
Callen:
Everyone on their knees! Down!

39:01.556 --> 39:03.088
Go.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.124
Callen: Eric, I need
an ambulance for kensi.

39:07.594 --> 39:09.560
Welcome to the worst part
of your life.

39:14.332 --> 39:15.864
Keep checking.

39:19.870 --> 39:22.337
Where are ammar and zhi?

39:22.339 --> 39:23.905
We're still searching for 'em.

39:26.476 --> 39:28.476
Yeah, that's right,
I lied to you.

39:28.478 --> 39:31.045
Ncis is conducting
a car-to-car search.

39:31.047 --> 39:33.213
Arrest him.

39:33.215 --> 39:34.547
You're being charged
with falsifying evidence,

39:34.549 --> 39:36.949
Impeding an investigation...
Callen: Wait.

39:36.951 --> 39:39.151
I asked agent hanna
to lie to you.

39:40.387 --> 39:42.520
It was just
my anxiety kicking in,

39:42.522 --> 39:45.055
But I freaked out
over agents blye and deeks

39:45.057 --> 39:46.222
Being in that much danger.

39:46.224 --> 39:48.557
No, this fish stinks
from the head.

39:48.559 --> 39:50.158
It was my plan, my orders.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.460
I'm a megalomaniac,
just can't be stopped.

39:52.462 --> 39:54.228
Be gentle
with the cuffs.

39:54.230 --> 39:56.496
I have delicate wrists.

39:56.498 --> 39:58.498
Nell:
All right, truth be told,

39:58.500 --> 40:01.634
I threatened agent hanna
with physical bodily harm

40:01.636 --> 40:03.168
If he didn't
lie to you.

40:03.170 --> 40:04.569
You threatened him?

40:04.571 --> 40:07.338
Told him I'd jack him up
if he didn't do it.

40:08.374 --> 40:10.073
Scared the hell out of me.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.275
Smart-asses.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.545
Fine.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.013
Arrest them all.

40:18.015 --> 40:19.014
Really?

40:19.016 --> 40:20.682
Yeah, really.

40:21.985 --> 40:24.652
Arrest 'em, I'll
make the case. Move.

40:24.654 --> 40:26.253
Thompson:
We got 'em!

40:30.425 --> 40:33.025
We found 'em both
in a trunk.

40:33.027 --> 40:35.660
We found $400,000 in cash
and a thumb drive.

40:40.099 --> 40:42.099
Lucky you.

40:42.101 --> 40:44.067
Let's get
out of here.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.968
No.

40:46.937 --> 40:49.938
Lucky you, mr. Guevara.

41:00.549 --> 41:02.515
(no audio)

41:02.517 --> 41:04.583
(door closes)

41:06.553 --> 41:08.419
Hey.
Hey.

41:08.421 --> 41:10.654
How you feeling?

41:10.656 --> 41:13.657
Uh, it's out of my system.

41:13.659 --> 41:15.992
Doctor said it was
a neuromuscular block,

41:15.994 --> 41:19.362
So... They basically
paralyzed me.

41:19.364 --> 41:21.030
I got to be honest.

41:21.032 --> 41:23.132
That was tough
seeing you like that.

41:23.134 --> 41:26.301
It was a pretty crazy feeling.

41:26.303 --> 41:28.169
Through the looking glass.

41:28.171 --> 41:30.638
So how are they doing?

41:30.640 --> 41:32.306
Oh, um, okay.

41:32.308 --> 41:35.008
Dod's gonna have to
give him some help.

41:35.010 --> 41:37.010
You know, a lot of
deprogramming to do.

41:37.012 --> 41:38.711
A lot to recover from.

41:41.515 --> 41:43.181
Huh, not so much.

41:43.183 --> 41:44.515
Yeah.

41:44.517 --> 41:47.217
Wow, look at that.

41:47.219 --> 41:49.018
Yeah, I guess love
conquers all.

41:49.020 --> 41:52.021
Speaking of which, my
whole kind of iliac crest

41:52.023 --> 41:54.089
Was really tight
from, uh, today,

41:54.091 --> 41:56.257
So I was thinking I might be
doing some stretching later on.

41:56.259 --> 41:58.425
It's not really your
iliac crest, but...

41:58.427 --> 42:00.427
Where is it? Here?

42:00.429 --> 42:01.995
Little, little there.
Little lower?

42:01.996 --> 42:03.562
Did you learn nothing today?
I learned something
this morning.

42:03.565 --> 42:05.097
I learned that, um...

42:05.099 --> 42:06.431
Here?

42:06.433 --> 42:07.565
...That I love
your iliac crest.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.466
Okay, and?

42:11.102 --> 42:13.435
And I learned that
the unlocked mind is nothing

42:13.437 --> 42:15.637
Without the unlocked body.

42:15.639 --> 42:18.106
And?

42:18.108 --> 42:20.341
And what else is there?

42:30.752 --> 42:32.084
(monitor blips)

42:32.086 --> 42:33.418
Did you just hear that?

42:33.420 --> 42:35.086
Uh-huh. Yep, yep.

42:35.088 --> 42:37.788
This is why
I have the rule.

42:37.790 --> 42:41.258
Uh, as long as it's not hetty,
I think we're gonna be fine.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.326
Should I move?
Uh...

42:43.328 --> 42:44.593
Do you think
she sees us?

42:44.595 --> 42:45.594
I don't know.

42:45.596 --> 42:47.128
It's not her.
Okay.

42:47.130 --> 42:48.362
I'm sure, we're fine.

42:48.364 --> 42:50.630
Okay, we're gonna be good,
we're gonna be good.

42:50.632 --> 42:56.068
Hetty: You better hope
love conquers all, mr. Deeks.

42:56.070 --> 42:58.136
Yep.
That was
definitely hetty.
