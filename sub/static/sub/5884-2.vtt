<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:02.940 --> 00:04.027
This was my father.

00:04.165 --> 00:06.087
My mother was a 23
year old prostitute

00:06.216 --> 00:08.295
who died having me.

00:08.775 --> 00:09.592
Lucky Strike.

00:09.816 --> 00:11.368
The shot of our lives.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.567
- Tell me what you think.
- I think you are the client,

00:13.696 --> 00:14.728
you should do what you want.

00:14.942 --> 00:18.831
The lost of Jai Alai makes
Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.575
You said you'd always come home.

00:20.695 --> 00:21.991
Did you make him leave?

00:22.095 --> 00:23.407
I wanna take you
in that bedroom

00:23.536 --> 00:25.512
and give you a go around
like you've never had.

00:26.944 --> 00:27.737
When are you moving out?

00:27.944 --> 00:29.665
We haven't found the
right place for the kids.

01:10.801 --> 01:14.333
I'm worried that's
gonna hit the ceiling.

01:14.401 --> 01:16.300
We always get a tall one.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.801
Not taller
than the living room.

01:17.868 --> 01:20.334
Let's go back to the other one

01:20.402 --> 01:22.102
And stand next to it.

01:25.070 --> 01:28.003
Hey, Sally. Sally.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.470
Hello.

01:31.538 --> 01:34.471
- It's Glen.
- I know that.

01:34.538 --> 01:37.005
Well, you all just
walked right by me
when you came in.

01:37.073 --> 01:39.105
Sorry.

01:39.172 --> 01:41.472
What are you doing back here?

01:41.540 --> 01:44.273
My mom got married
and now I'm supposed
to live with him.

01:44.341 --> 01:47.908
I saw your new dad.
My mom said that
would happen.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.242
After they're married awhile,
they'll have a baby.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.943
You should probably ask
for something big now.

01:55.978 --> 01:58.345
Hi. Are you
getting a tree?

01:58.412 --> 02:00.445
No, I'm working.

02:00.513 --> 02:03.847
- What do you do?
- I bring twine over.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.715
I get to cut it.

02:06.782 --> 02:09.615
- Wow.
- Yeah, I made it.

02:09.683 --> 02:11.983
Those are good colors.

02:12.051 --> 02:15.151
We're leaving as soon
as I find you.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.519
- Bye, Glen.
- Maybe I'll call you.

02:29.492 --> 02:31.692
- Good time,
bad time?
- Yes.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.794
you've got a resume

02:35.862 --> 02:37.695
From the girl you met
at the Ziegfeld theater.

02:37.763 --> 02:40.763
- File it.
- Al Weaver
at Johnson wax

02:40.831 --> 02:42.764
Requested another
print of glo-coat.

02:42.832 --> 02:46.866
And you got this
very important
piece of mail.

02:51.536 --> 02:52.669
Open it.

02:56.204 --> 02:59.705
"dear daddy,
Bobby thinks this is
going to the north pole

02:59.773 --> 03:02.507
But we should
keep up the roos."

03:02.574 --> 03:05.675
- R-double-o-s.
- Too much television.

03:05.743 --> 03:08.176
"Bobby says he knows
that he doesn't deserve"

03:08.244 --> 03:10.411
A heath Kit radio
because of what happened

03:10.478 --> 03:13.012
With leaving
the freezer open
in the garage

03:13.079 --> 03:17.481
But maybe Santa could
choose from a bicycle,
a better pellet gun,

03:17.549 --> 03:19.516
A clock radio,
a transistor radio,

03:19.584 --> 03:21.384
"A drum set
and a bicycle."

03:21.452 --> 03:23.252
I left that freezer open.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.654
"baby gene wants a fireman.

03:26.722 --> 03:28.055
I don't know
what that means."

03:28.123 --> 03:29.957
Adorable.

03:30.024 --> 03:32.458
"and I would like
the gold necklace"

03:32.526 --> 03:35.360
That you can
put your initials on
that we saw at Macy's.

03:35.428 --> 03:38.830
And most of all,
I'd like you to be here
on Christmas morning

03:38.897 --> 03:41.999
"To give it to me,
but I know you can't be."

03:46.803 --> 03:48.403
I'm sorry.

03:51.473 --> 03:55.141
So a drum set, a fire truck...

03:55.209 --> 03:57.777
The necklace is $30.

03:57.845 --> 04:00.747
It's s. B.D....
Sally Beth draper.

04:03.351 --> 04:05.886
and...

04:05.953 --> 04:08.722
Get her some Beatles 45s

04:08.789 --> 04:11.691
And him a transistor radio too.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.261
Um, the girls went to Joan

04:15.329 --> 04:17.063
And I don't want
to undermine her,

04:17.130 --> 04:20.433
But are we allowed
to bring a friend
to the Christmas party?

04:20.500 --> 04:23.102
Lane scaled it back

04:23.170 --> 04:25.905
To a glass of gin
and a box of Velveeta.

04:25.973 --> 04:27.607
We're tightening our belts.

04:29.042 --> 04:31.144
<i>But you will be
getting a bonus,</i>

04:31.212 --> 04:32.612
Even if I have to
see to it myself.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.181
Well, thank you.

04:35.249 --> 04:37.984
I didn't want to have
to write a letter to Santa.

04:38.052 --> 04:41.087
- Do you want this?
- Sure.

04:45.491 --> 04:47.325
Send him in.

04:49.895 --> 04:51.696
ready Freddy.

04:51.764 --> 04:53.731
It's been too long.

04:53.799 --> 04:55.699
Nah, just long enough.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.968
You look good.
Have a seat.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.771
Jeez.

04:59.839 --> 05:01.973
It looks like
an Italian hospital in here.

05:02.041 --> 05:04.275
I know, I know.
Jane got a decorator.

05:04.343 --> 05:07.445
I feel like with my hair
you can't even see me in here.

05:07.513 --> 05:09.681
- Something brown?
- Maybe later.

05:09.748 --> 05:12.750
What time is it?
Oh, look at that.

05:12.818 --> 05:16.054
So I thought it'd
be best if I broached
this opportunity in person.

05:16.122 --> 05:18.056
Well, don't be fooled
by the setup here.

05:18.123 --> 05:19.490
It's Potemkinville.

05:19.524 --> 05:21.692
Well, maybe I can help.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.894
I walked out of j.W.T.

05:23.961 --> 05:26.796
With a present
under my arm...
pond's cold cream.

05:26.864 --> 05:29.765
It's $2 million,
but they'll never
even notice it's gone.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.834
How the hell did you do that?

05:31.901 --> 05:34.069
Suffice it to say

05:34.136 --> 05:36.171
The client and I are
in a fraternity together.

05:37.539 --> 05:39.273
I can't handle
the account myself,

05:39.341 --> 05:41.875
But I'm clean and sober now...

05:41.943 --> 05:43.710
16 months without a drop.

05:43.778 --> 05:47.346
- So when you
said "maybe later"?
- What am I gonna say?

05:47.414 --> 05:50.449
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can keep the account.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.651
What am I gonna say?

05:52.718 --> 05:54.319
Yes.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.054
There is one little caveat.

05:57.122 --> 05:58.956
Name it.

05:59.024 --> 06:01.691
I feel like I'm getting
sucked into that thing.

06:04.028 --> 06:06.295
I don't want
Pete Campbell near this.

06:06.363 --> 06:08.230
I was surprised
you took him along.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.801
No comment.

06:13.869 --> 06:16.870
Sugarberry has been
selling hams for 30 years
at a fairly steady rate

06:16.938 --> 06:19.139
While doing in everything
they could to create sales,

06:19.206 --> 06:21.274
And then we do this in a month.

06:21.342 --> 06:22.942
We have to give them time
to reconcile that.

06:24.477 --> 06:26.745
- Freddy!
- Ballerina.

06:29.816 --> 06:31.283
I feel like the tin man.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.351
Good to see you.

06:33.419 --> 06:35.153
How are you, Freddy?

06:35.221 --> 06:36.855
Couldn't be better.

06:36.922 --> 06:38.323
I was just talking about you.

06:39.992 --> 06:41.526
Freddy here just
ran in from the yard

06:41.594 --> 06:43.561
With a $2-million account
in his mouth.

06:43.629 --> 06:46.264
- Pond's cold cream.
- Well, that explains
why you look so good.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.269
A little early for that,
isn't it, don?

06:51.337 --> 06:52.670
Very funny.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.808
The pedigree
of this account is
that it was boosted.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.777
And I'll need to maintain
my personal contact
to it creatively.

06:59.845 --> 07:01.546
If that's all right
with you, don.

07:01.613 --> 07:03.047
If you don't mind working
with this old thing over here.

07:03.115 --> 07:05.216
I was counting on it.

07:05.283 --> 07:07.985
- Oh, none for me.
- Oh.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.925
- When can you bring 'em in?
- I'll be handling
this one, Pete.

07:15.660 --> 07:19.296
Well, Freddy,
I hate to bring this up,

07:19.364 --> 07:22.166
But I do believe
it's on everyone's mind.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.102
We all want to know
if you can be Santa
at the Christmas party.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.037
It's the role
I was born to play.

07:35.113 --> 07:36.680
Francis residence.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.816
Can Sally come to the phone?

07:38.884 --> 07:40.785
Who may I say is calling?

07:40.852 --> 07:43.554
Stanley. I have
a question about homework.

07:45.223 --> 07:47.858
Sally, there's a young man
on the phone... Stanley.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.265
- Hello?
- It's Glen.

07:53.332 --> 07:55.100
Oh, hi.

07:55.168 --> 07:57.735
Don't you wanna know why
I said my name is Stanley?

07:57.803 --> 07:59.770
I guess.

07:59.838 --> 08:02.206
Because this is private.

08:06.344 --> 08:09.547
- Where are you?
- Where do you think?

08:09.614 --> 08:11.282
I'm down the street
at my mom's.

08:14.419 --> 08:16.887
How come you didn't move?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.356
I don't know.

08:19.424 --> 08:22.860
I hate it here.
I really really do.

08:22.927 --> 08:24.761
Why?

08:24.829 --> 08:26.563
I won't tell anybody.

08:28.432 --> 08:30.233
Every time I go
around a corner,

08:30.300 --> 08:32.735
I keep thinking
I'll see my dad.

08:32.802 --> 08:34.903
Sorry.

08:34.971 --> 08:38.273
- They're not gonna get
back together, you know.
- Glen?

08:38.341 --> 08:40.942
Especially now
that she's doing it
with somebody else.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.779
<i>- Doing what?
Glen!</i>

08:43.846 --> 08:45.347
Well, don't worry.

08:45.415 --> 08:47.449
One day they'll wake up
and they'll want to move.

08:47.517 --> 08:49.384
You'll see.
I've gotta go. Bye.

08:49.452 --> 08:51.386
Goodbye.

08:54.657 --> 08:58.026
- Who's Stanley?
- A boy.

09:00.664 --> 09:02.932
We will soon
be charging clients
for this service

09:02.999 --> 09:05.134
And Dr. Atherton will
in turn be charging us.

09:05.202 --> 09:06.836
Significantly less.

09:06.904 --> 09:10.204
Bert and I have
been meaning to work
together for years.

09:10.271 --> 09:12.072
Out in the open at least.

09:12.140 --> 09:14.106
Very good then.
Shall we dim the lights?

09:14.174 --> 09:17.810
No, beginning the presentation
with the film is a mistake.

09:17.877 --> 09:20.812
Audiences will listen
to anything in anticipation.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.947
See what I was talking about?

09:23.015 --> 09:26.150
Simply said, we believe
that at the motivational
research group,

09:26.217 --> 09:28.585
We have brought the science
of consumer evaluation

09:28.653 --> 09:31.921
To a point of precision like
that of a surgeon's scalpel.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.056
No doubt, with the help of minds
like Dr. Faye Miller,

09:34.124 --> 09:37.692
With whose work you are
already unknowingly familiar.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.461
Faye helped develop
the indelible image

09:40.529 --> 09:43.697
That has become
the standard of feminine
hygiene advertising...

09:43.765 --> 09:47.034
The carefree gal
in white pants.

09:50.638 --> 09:52.772
It's right up there
with the polio vaccine.

09:56.376 --> 09:57.943
Beyond demographic
information...

09:58.011 --> 09:59.978
Salary, age,
marital situation...

10:00.046 --> 10:02.080
We've tried to find
a way to select prospects

10:02.147 --> 10:03.748
Who can really provide insight.

10:03.816 --> 10:05.916
This test is our beginning.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.285
Take a minute, fill it out

10:08.352 --> 10:10.220
And please take a cookie.

10:10.287 --> 10:12.455
What's it mean if we don't?

10:12.523 --> 10:14.623
That you're a psychopath.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.060
<i>The point
of this exercise is</i>

10:19.128 --> 10:21.128
To familiarize you
with our methods.

10:21.196 --> 10:25.533
The point of the cookies
is that everyone should be
rewarded for their time.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.937
These questions
have been designed

10:30.004 --> 10:31.705
To get at what
subjects really want

10:31.773 --> 10:33.874
<i>Instead of what
they say they do.</i>

10:33.942 --> 10:37.778
What are the real feelings
that exist below the surface?

10:37.845 --> 10:41.414
For example, "how would you
describe your father?"

10:41.482 --> 10:43.383
No matter what the answer,

10:43.451 --> 10:45.752
It creates
a level of intimacy
for the next question,

10:45.820 --> 10:48.521
"who makes decisions
in your household?"

10:48.589 --> 10:50.957
There's some pencils
if you need them.

11:06.140 --> 11:07.874
I apologize.
I have an appointment.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.619
That is yours to keep.

11:22.356 --> 11:25.825
- Is that work?
- No, it's me.
It's kind of silly.

11:25.892 --> 11:27.826
Tell me when
they pull the curtains
so I can get out of here.

11:27.894 --> 11:29.595
- Do you want ice?
- Yes.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.841
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

11:42.909 --> 11:46.578
Saint Vincent's junior staff
Christmas party.

11:46.646 --> 11:50.348
- At 8:00 in the morning?
- Well, the shift just ended
and we have to do it soon,

11:50.415 --> 11:53.917
Because Christmas
and new year's we're
overrun with suicides.

11:53.985 --> 11:57.387
- Well, uh...
- Phoebe.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.923
And you're don.
I know.

11:59.991 --> 12:03.361
- I hope we haven't met.
- Well, I'm right
across the hall.

12:03.429 --> 12:05.463
We wave to each other.

12:05.530 --> 12:09.065
You met my friend Sarah.
She fell on the stairs.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.034
Maybe you weren't in uniform.

12:11.102 --> 12:13.904
Don't pretend that
you've never noticed me.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.341
You always grunt when you put
your keys in the door.

12:18.409 --> 12:23.079
It's not good,
which is why I am
inviting you to my party.

12:23.147 --> 12:26.016
I really appreciate
the invitation, Phoebe,

12:26.084 --> 12:27.651
But I'm late for work.

12:27.719 --> 12:30.053
So you should thank me
for waking you.

12:34.726 --> 12:37.895
Tallulah Bankhead,
she's glamorous.

12:37.963 --> 12:40.231
She seems
more uncompromising
than a movie star,

12:40.299 --> 12:41.866
You know,
because she's on Broadway.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.368
She never got off Broadway
because she's not
beautiful enough.

12:44.436 --> 12:46.770
Shame on you.
Come on.

12:46.838 --> 12:49.607
A little backstage
at the makeup mirror
with pond's.

12:49.674 --> 12:51.675
A big bouquet of roses,
opening night.

12:51.743 --> 12:53.410
"the choice
of professionals."

12:53.478 --> 12:55.412
It's good, right?

12:57.282 --> 13:00.817
All of their research
says that they're trying
to get young women.

13:00.885 --> 13:02.986
Well, young women
look up to older women.

13:03.054 --> 13:05.955
For beauty tips?
Are you joking?

13:06.022 --> 13:08.224
I know the client.
This thing is rigged.

13:08.291 --> 13:11.228
<i>- That's what he wants.
- It's not just about
the client.</i>

13:11.296 --> 13:13.931
People are looking
at everything we do here.

13:13.999 --> 13:16.734
Have you seen our work?
It's very different than this.

13:16.802 --> 13:19.403
- Frederick van Rumsen!
- Von.

13:19.471 --> 13:22.206
boy oh boy,
were you missed at lunch.

13:22.274 --> 13:24.208
Cal Rutledge
from pond's.
What a cut-up.

13:24.276 --> 13:27.578
- What do you mean?
- I mean I've got
to go lay down.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.954
- I can't believe
that's his job.

13:40.925 --> 13:43.493
Hello. Can you tell him
Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?

13:44.862 --> 13:47.364
- Interrupt him.
- What's wrong?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.202
Calvin, do you have
anything to tell me?

13:52.269 --> 13:54.637
Uh-huh.

13:54.705 --> 13:57.073
Did you just have lunch
with Roger sterling?

13:58.675 --> 13:59.909
So you have nothing to say?

14:01.178 --> 14:03.279
Hey hey, don't do that.

14:03.347 --> 14:05.047
It's okay.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.317
Pull yourself together.

14:09.753 --> 14:12.588
First baptist church,
79th and Broadway.

14:15.659 --> 14:18.394
- I've gotta go.
- Is everything okay?

14:18.462 --> 14:20.930
What, you can't put
two and two together?

14:22.766 --> 14:24.767
Listen, cutie,
wrap your head around

14:24.835 --> 14:26.335
Finding the right famous face

14:26.403 --> 14:28.104
Or my other thing
about the t zone.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.406
I want 10 tags apiece,

14:30.473 --> 14:32.474
Then I narrow it down
and then we go to don.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.410
are you serious?

14:34.477 --> 14:36.678
I'll do 'em too.
Don't worry.

14:36.746 --> 14:39.248
I'm sure yours'll be better
because you're girlier.

14:42.652 --> 14:45.286
<i>Lee garner Jr.</i>

14:48.624 --> 14:50.925
Put him through.

14:50.993 --> 14:53.261
<i>- Caroline, did he say
what it was about?</i>

14:57.366 --> 14:59.535
Well, hello, Lee.
How's palm beach?

14:59.602 --> 15:02.271
Beautiful.
Heading back there
in a couple of days.

15:02.339 --> 15:03.706
Back? Where the hell
are you?

15:03.773 --> 15:06.876
In town doing a little
Christmas shopping.

15:06.944 --> 15:08.711
Yeah, I'd love
to see you now that
I know you're in town.

15:08.779 --> 15:10.246
Caroline!

15:12.849 --> 15:15.284
- How about dinner tomorrow?
- Christmas party.

15:15.352 --> 15:17.219
How about lunch?
We're having a Christmas party.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.755
Why am I getting
my invitation so late?

15:19.822 --> 15:21.490
Because I thought
you were out of town.

15:21.558 --> 15:24.226
Huh. Madison Avenue
office Christmas party?

15:24.294 --> 15:26.028
I've seen the movies.
You find me.

15:26.095 --> 15:28.530
Okay. 3:00?

15:28.597 --> 15:30.398
- No, 4:00.
- 5:00.

15:30.466 --> 15:31.465
Shit. Go get Lee.

15:33.135 --> 15:34.769
I'm looking forward to it.

15:34.837 --> 15:36.271
You won't be disappointed.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.373
Oh.

15:43.446 --> 15:45.914
I just got off the phone
with Lee garner Jr.

15:45.982 --> 15:49.251
He's going to stop by.
We're going to have to
have a Christmas party,

15:49.319 --> 15:51.120
- A real one.
- How did that happen?

15:51.188 --> 15:53.256
It happened.
In fact, he was offended

15:53.324 --> 15:54.991
That we hadn't
invited him already.

15:55.059 --> 15:56.960
Uninvite him.

15:57.028 --> 15:59.530
Take him to the four seasons.
He can have three entries.

15:59.598 --> 16:01.465
This man doesn't care
about food.

16:03.969 --> 16:07.403
I know that you've
lived your life from
a bottomless pocket,

16:07.471 --> 16:11.140
But there's a very real
system of money coming in
versus money going out.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.310
Overtime,
supplies being
used carelessly,

16:14.378 --> 16:17.914
Leaving the lights on,
parties... it adds up.

16:17.982 --> 16:20.617
Listen, Olivier,
aren't you the one
who's always talking about

16:20.684 --> 16:23.920
How lucky strike is 99%
of our business or something?

16:23.987 --> 16:26.389
69% if we land
pond's cold cream.

16:26.457 --> 16:28.457
We have pond's
and I hate the way
you say "percent,"

16:28.525 --> 16:31.494
- Do you know that?
- What about our other clients?

16:31.562 --> 16:33.462
We have no other clients.

16:33.530 --> 16:37.900
If Lee garner Jr.
Wants three wise men
flown in from Jerusalem,

16:37.968 --> 16:40.669
He gets it.
Caroline!

16:40.737 --> 16:44.507
Get Joanie in here.
You want something?
I brought it from home.

16:48.713 --> 16:50.748
- Yes?
- There's been
a small adjustment

16:50.815 --> 16:52.917
To the scale
of our Christmas party.

16:52.985 --> 16:56.453
- Lower or higher?
- Lee garner Jr. Will
be joining us.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.222
I trust you will make
the appropriate improvements.

16:59.289 --> 17:01.090
Well, I don't.
We need to change
its rating

17:01.158 --> 17:03.760
From convalescent home
to Roman orgy.

17:07.598 --> 17:08.933
Maalox.

17:11.303 --> 17:13.805
I want a bartender and a tree.

17:13.872 --> 17:15.607
Screw him.
I love Christmas.

17:15.675 --> 17:17.608
You love Christmas parties.

17:17.676 --> 17:19.711
We're going to need
more employees,

17:19.779 --> 17:22.347
So I'm going to allow
everyone escorts,
even the girls.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.683
New York food...
deli and Chinese...

17:24.750 --> 17:26.518
And some kind of gift
for Mr. Garner.

17:26.586 --> 17:28.220
You're off-limits.

17:28.287 --> 17:30.655
I don't think he's the one
who needs to be reminded.

17:30.723 --> 17:32.524
Oh, come on.

17:32.592 --> 17:34.793
He was all over you
the time you wore
that red dress...

17:34.861 --> 17:37.196
The one with the bow
in the back that makes
you look like a present.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.732
- You have an incredible memory.
- Yeah, I think about it a lot...

17:39.800 --> 17:42.101
That dress, I mean.

17:42.169 --> 17:45.505
- Could you wear it?
- Stop it.

17:45.573 --> 17:46.973
I didn't mean it that way.

17:48.642 --> 17:51.544
All I was saying was
this is the office
and that's life.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.412
This is good

17:53.480 --> 17:55.314
And that's life.

18:04.311 --> 18:06.712
What a nice surprise.

18:06.780 --> 18:08.680
Sheila at the station
baked them.

18:08.748 --> 18:11.481
Sheila.
Who's Sheila?

18:11.549 --> 18:14.384
Huh.
She's 60 years old.

18:14.451 --> 18:16.251
You see how shaky the icing is?

18:22.691 --> 18:25.326
Hey, knock it off.

18:25.394 --> 18:27.195
Why?
Is Rasputin home?

18:27.263 --> 18:28.996
Shh. She'll hear you.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.165
I want to lie down.
I'm tired.

18:31.232 --> 18:34.234
Uh-huh. My bed is
covered with work.

18:34.302 --> 18:37.638
- That's kind of symbolic.
- How is my face?

18:37.706 --> 18:40.641
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.443
Let me get a better look.

18:42.510 --> 18:45.080
you taste like soap.

18:45.147 --> 18:48.118
I'm in the middle
of a seven-day beauty plan.

18:48.185 --> 18:50.186
can't we just

18:50.254 --> 18:52.789
Get undressed
and lie together again?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.761
That was a bad idea.

18:56.829 --> 18:59.598
how long is this
gonna go on?

18:59.665 --> 19:02.333
Oh, I'm sorry you feel
you've put in the time.

19:02.401 --> 19:05.870
- We're not doing anything.
- We're doing some things.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.607
We're not doing anything
I can't do myself.

19:11.077 --> 19:12.745
Mark.

19:12.813 --> 19:15.014
I told you I want you.

19:15.081 --> 19:18.284
In fact I want you
so much I wanna wait.

19:18.352 --> 19:21.488
And I told you there's
nothing to be afraid of.

19:22.791 --> 19:24.992
I want to be your first.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.001
You're so old-fashioned.

19:33.069 --> 19:34.670
No, I'm not.

19:36.006 --> 19:38.508
In Sweden, they make love

19:38.576 --> 19:40.511
The minute they feel attracted.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.580
And it's healthier,
because you can find,

19:42.648 --> 19:45.284
You know, the perfect person.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.193
Because making love is
a very important part
of a life with someone.

19:49.463 --> 19:53.243
The most important.
In Sweden, anyway.

19:53.311 --> 19:55.480
Where did you hear that?

19:55.548 --> 19:57.716
I read this article,
"the Swedish way of love."

19:57.784 --> 19:59.985
It's very enlightened.

20:00.053 --> 20:02.822
You're never going
to get me to do anything
Swedish people do.

20:02.890 --> 20:05.625
All you have
to do is take a couple
of steps that way.

20:07.762 --> 20:09.630
- I brought you cookies.
- Huh.

20:13.202 --> 20:14.836
I think you should go home.

20:27.553 --> 20:29.354
<i>And I want you
to think about that.</i>

20:43.101 --> 20:45.235
Sorry.
Everybody leaves

20:45.303 --> 20:46.904
The moment
you have to clean up.

20:48.940 --> 20:51.742
I might have a vacuum.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.718
where the hell are
you coming from?

21:00.785 --> 21:03.655
- Work.
- Where do you work?

21:03.723 --> 21:05.324
The white horse tavern?

21:07.997 --> 21:10.166
Did you have
a party or something?

21:10.233 --> 21:13.870
- I hate parties.
- And you hate Christmas.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.978
- I got it.
- I don't hate Christmas.

21:17.046 --> 21:19.079
I hate this Christmas.

21:26.651 --> 21:28.285
Of course you have heat.

21:31.887 --> 21:33.420
Can I get you something?

21:34.721 --> 21:38.389
Come on.
You're going to bed.

21:41.856 --> 21:43.989
Look where we are.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.589
- You're good with that.
- My father was a drunk.

21:51.525 --> 21:53.325
If you don't behave yourself,

21:53.392 --> 21:54.891
I'm not gonna take
your shoes off

21:54.959 --> 21:57.025
And you're gonna wake up
with sores on your heels.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.327
How can you stand going
to a hospital every day?

22:03.395 --> 22:05.428
I love working
at the hospital...

22:06.862 --> 22:08.462
People coming into the world,

22:08.530 --> 22:09.897
People leaving it.

22:09.965 --> 22:11.866
Everything happens there.

22:16.304 --> 22:18.037
good night, don.

22:20.607 --> 22:21.874
good night!

22:29.614 --> 22:32.282
Against the wall,
please. Megan.

22:35.286 --> 22:37.887
The bar looks good.
I need you to get

22:37.954 --> 22:39.787
The chafing dishes
and the sternos.

22:39.854 --> 22:42.485
Then call Peking house
and move the delivery
from 4:00 to 3:30.

22:42.553 --> 22:44.452
- They're always late.
- Yes, Joan.

22:44.519 --> 22:48.387
that one.

22:48.454 --> 22:52.116
On the short list I've got
Tallulah, Jessica Tandy,

22:52.184 --> 22:54.247
Barbara Stanwyck and Doris day.

22:54.315 --> 22:58.077
- Different types.
- I don't even understand
your list.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.842
What's wrong
with Elizabeth Taylor?

23:00.910 --> 23:03.411
Isn't it about making
old ladies look good?

23:03.479 --> 23:05.246
Nothing makes
old ladies look good.

23:05.314 --> 23:08.082
But pond's does.
That's the point.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.050
If young girls
started using it,

23:10.118 --> 23:12.686
Maybe they'd find a husband
and they wouldn't be so angry.

23:14.655 --> 23:18.257
All I was trying to say
is that I've used the stuff

23:18.324 --> 23:21.025
And I think
there's something
about the experience

23:21.093 --> 23:23.327
Of putting it on
and looking in the mirror.

23:23.395 --> 23:26.363
If we were
to go another way,
that's not a bad idea.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.764
Indulging yourself, right?

23:28.832 --> 23:31.000
No, if you use pond's,
you'll get married.

23:32.635 --> 23:34.069
That's not what I was saying.

23:34.136 --> 23:35.436
Or we could go the other way.

23:35.504 --> 23:38.005
If you don't use it,
then you'll never get married.

23:39.274 --> 23:40.940
Which is better?

23:41.008 --> 23:42.542
You know what?
Just write 'em down.

23:42.609 --> 23:44.443
No, I'm not writing that down.

23:45.812 --> 23:48.513
I'm sorry if I hit
a nerve there, precious.

23:48.581 --> 23:51.749
You know, Freddy, I have
brought your name up 100 times

23:51.817 --> 23:55.219
In the last year to come in
and freelance, for me,

23:55.286 --> 23:57.887
But everybody is
right about you.

23:57.955 --> 24:01.823
You and your grand dames,
your portable typewriter

24:01.891 --> 24:04.058
And your desperate spinsters...

24:04.126 --> 24:05.626
You're old-fashioned.
You know that?

24:09.163 --> 24:10.797
<i>- Miss Olson?
- Yes?</i>

24:10.865 --> 24:13.065
<i>Everybody's leaving
to get dressed
for the party.</i>

24:13.133 --> 24:15.301
<i>- Do you need me right now?
- No, you can go.</i>

24:19.805 --> 24:21.839
I... I'm...

24:21.907 --> 24:24.108
I'm sorry, Freddy.

24:24.175 --> 24:25.742
Don't worry about it.

24:27.011 --> 24:28.544
Is Violet coming?

24:29.779 --> 24:31.446
She wouldn't miss it.

25:15.208 --> 25:15.274
<i>- Oh, thank you, dear.
You know Peter.</i>

25:17.877 --> 25:20.009
He'd rather spend
every waking second
right here in the city.

25:20.077 --> 25:23.210
Who'd want to miss Christmas
in New York? 5th Avenue...

25:23.278 --> 25:25.445
Chestnuts roasting
on a greasy man's
open street cart.

25:25.513 --> 25:27.514
My goodness.

25:27.582 --> 25:30.083
We're going to
the Bahamas and there's
nothing else to it.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.284
Harry spent so much time
in Los Angeles,

25:32.352 --> 25:34.486
- I figured I'd treat him
to the mountains.
- Stowe.

25:36.189 --> 25:37.922
What about you, don?
Do you have any plans?

25:37.990 --> 25:40.492
Yes, heading to Acapulco.

25:40.559 --> 25:44.128
- Are you taking
anyone special?
- No.

25:44.195 --> 25:47.097
- Well, it's your own fault.
- Yes, I pity him,

25:47.164 --> 25:49.265
Marooned in
that sea of bikinis.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.534
<i>- merry Christmas.</i>

25:52.936 --> 25:55.037
- Nice to see you again.
- And you as well, sir.

25:55.105 --> 25:56.771
- Don.
- Okay. Don.

25:59.542 --> 26:01.742
We're going to get
something to drink.

26:05.079 --> 26:06.780
Where the hell is he?

26:08.849 --> 26:10.783
They are children,

26:10.851 --> 26:12.418
And they can't accept the fact

26:12.486 --> 26:14.687
That others have to make
decisions for them.

26:14.754 --> 26:18.056
<i>So we are not part
of this herd you're
talking about.</i>

26:18.124 --> 26:20.225
you're from Great Britain.

26:20.293 --> 26:23.161
I'd think you'd be
familiar with the perils
of socialism.

26:23.229 --> 26:26.331
Civil rights is the beginning

26:26.399 --> 26:28.233
<i>Of a slippery slope.</i>

26:28.301 --> 26:29.902
If they pass Medicare,

26:29.969 --> 26:33.404
They won't stop until
they ban personal property.

26:33.472 --> 26:36.407
Storm our houses
and rape our wives.

26:36.474 --> 26:39.576
Mmm. Mmm.

26:39.644 --> 26:41.644
Man your battle stations!

26:43.347 --> 26:45.515
Nice dress.
Where's Mr. Holloway?

26:45.583 --> 26:47.217
Saving lives.

26:47.285 --> 26:49.353
Everyone, ladies,
come on, let's go.

26:53.858 --> 26:55.759
Don't forget it's a party.

27:10.842 --> 27:13.009
Please please.

27:13.077 --> 27:15.645
I walked in here
five minutes ago,
no one did anything.

27:15.713 --> 27:18.448
Merry Christmas, Lee.
That's quite a tan.

27:18.516 --> 27:21.384
I work at it.
When can we expepe
something for lucky strike

27:21.452 --> 27:22.952
As good
as "let me out of here!"

27:23.019 --> 27:26.021
Well, glo-coat told me
to swing for the fences.

27:26.088 --> 27:28.490
Well, I didn't know
I had to ask, Donny.

27:28.558 --> 27:30.960
We have gifts, girls and games,

27:31.027 --> 27:32.561
But first I'm going
to get you some food.

27:32.629 --> 27:33.862
Well, that's a good idea, red.

27:33.930 --> 27:35.531
I've been drinking all day.

27:49.010 --> 27:50.477
Don't turn
on the lights, shithead.

28:02.558 --> 28:04.126
Come on.

28:31.623 --> 28:34.825
If you hear anything, run.
Don't worry about me.

29:05.985 --> 29:07.720
Whoo!

29:07.788 --> 29:10.090
Megan, can you get
Mr. Garner a drink?

29:11.859 --> 29:14.394
- Where's Santa?
- He didn't show,

29:14.462 --> 29:16.397
But he did leave some presents.

29:16.465 --> 29:19.068
- Joan.
- Well, I could've sworn

29:19.136 --> 29:21.006
I conga'ed by a suit.

29:21.074 --> 29:23.308
- You want to be Santa?
- Hell no.

29:24.644 --> 29:26.211
How about you, Roger?

29:26.279 --> 29:28.947
I would but I'm
allergic to velvet.

29:29.015 --> 29:30.849
come on. You'll do great.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.884
- Are you serious?
- Damn straight.

29:32.952 --> 29:35.587
I don't think so.

29:37.022 --> 29:39.424
I'll do it.
I'd love to be Santa.

29:39.491 --> 29:40.858
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

29:40.926 --> 29:43.094
It'd take three of you
to fill that suit.

29:43.162 --> 29:45.663
Besides, everybody knows
Santa's got white hair.

29:45.731 --> 29:47.698
Put it on, Roger.

29:49.134 --> 29:50.968
Come on, Lee.

29:51.036 --> 29:52.737
Put it on.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.485
He's a hell of a sport.

30:18.696 --> 30:20.530
everybody just stay there.

30:23.968 --> 30:27.470
- Call the police.
- Is somebody in the house?

30:27.538 --> 30:29.139
Maybe it's a bear.

30:30.675 --> 30:32.008
Hello?

30:33.544 --> 30:35.478
I'm guessing it's kids.

30:37.148 --> 30:39.182
Let me look around the house.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.885
- Hello?
- Just stay here.

30:44.555 --> 30:46.089
Where's your lovely wife, lane?

30:46.157 --> 30:48.591
She and my son are in London.

30:48.659 --> 30:50.359
I shall be
joining them soon enough.

30:50.427 --> 30:54.263
Mine's in Florida.
I guess we'll suffer
through, eh, Jeeves?

30:54.331 --> 30:56.699
<i>- Mmm.
Ho ho ho!</i>

30:56.767 --> 30:59.669
Merry Christmas!

31:02.439 --> 31:05.375
It's hard to tell
if he's father Christmas
or father time.

31:05.442 --> 31:08.076
Merry Christmas!

31:08.143 --> 31:09.844
That's a big bag, Roger.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.713
Don't want you to have
a third heart attack.

31:12.781 --> 31:14.315
Right, honey?

31:16.285 --> 31:18.219
What have we here?

31:18.286 --> 31:21.522
What do all
the good boys and girls
want for Christmas?

31:21.590 --> 31:24.325
- Lucky strike!
thank you.

31:24.393 --> 31:27.161
You're welcome.
Don't smoke those
all at once.

31:28.496 --> 31:31.298
And I have
a very special present

31:31.366 --> 31:34.935
For a little boy who knows
he's been naughty.

31:35.003 --> 31:36.069
Lee.

31:39.007 --> 31:40.674
You didn't need to do that.

31:40.742 --> 31:42.609
Yes, we did.

31:48.983 --> 31:51.318
Look at that.

31:51.386 --> 31:52.653
It's a Polaroid.

31:54.522 --> 31:56.323
Thank you.

31:56.391 --> 31:58.392
It reminds me
of when I was a kid.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.427
Remember that?

32:00.495 --> 32:02.229
You'd ask for something,
you'd get it

32:02.297 --> 32:04.465
And it made you happy.

32:04.532 --> 32:08.602
merry Christmas!

32:11.306 --> 32:13.474
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas, don.

32:16.544 --> 32:18.212
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

32:19.581 --> 32:21.782
<i>There's eggs in my bed!</i>

32:23.751 --> 32:25.485
You can sleep
in our room if you want.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.388
My room's fine.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.163
- Anybody home?
- Not for much longer.

32:49.230 --> 32:52.166
I can't leave until
Geoff and Bert Cooper

32:52.233 --> 32:54.234
Figure out how to take
food from children.

32:54.302 --> 32:56.003
Well, if anyone can do it...

32:57.705 --> 33:00.006
How many Christmas parties
do you have to go to?

33:03.211 --> 33:06.446
I pity you.
Please, sit down.

33:06.514 --> 33:10.584
No, I just want
to make sure there
were no problems.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.486
You really are
a full-service company.

33:14.554 --> 33:15.921
It's just
you didn't take the test

33:15.988 --> 33:17.489
And I know you're
the creative shaman
around here,

33:17.557 --> 33:19.291
But you walked out
of my presentation.

33:21.763 --> 33:23.697
I'm disappointed.

33:23.765 --> 33:26.167
I thought you
came in to flirt,
but you came in to fight.

33:28.570 --> 33:31.272
You have to know I found out
all I could about you.

33:32.641 --> 33:34.208
Your work is very interesting

33:34.276 --> 33:36.677
And I guess I was hoping
you thought mine was.

33:36.745 --> 33:38.712
It's not personal.
I just don't think

33:38.780 --> 33:40.448
You can learn much
about people that way.

33:40.515 --> 33:42.516
I learned a lot about you.

33:42.584 --> 33:45.185
You're the kind
of man who doesn't want
to take the test.

33:47.088 --> 33:49.223
I'm sorry.
I just don't see

33:49.290 --> 33:51.925
How knowing about
my childhood is gonna
help sell floor wax.

33:51.993 --> 33:53.960
I saw that ad.

33:54.028 --> 33:55.929
It's all about
somebody's childhood.

33:57.831 --> 34:00.066
Look, we're both
in the same business.

34:00.134 --> 34:02.435
I'm not embarrassed to say

34:02.503 --> 34:06.007
It's about helping people
somehow to sort out their
deepest conflict.

34:06.075 --> 34:07.709
And what is that?

34:07.777 --> 34:09.878
In a nutshell,

34:09.946 --> 34:13.514
It all comes down to
"what I want" versus
"what's expected of me."

34:18.253 --> 34:21.056
- That's true.
- I know it's true.

34:21.123 --> 34:23.692
You would've known
it's true if you'd
stayed for my presentation.

34:27.763 --> 34:29.897
Want to get some dinner
or something?

34:31.632 --> 34:33.467
No thank you.

34:33.534 --> 34:34.902
But apology accepted.

34:37.539 --> 34:41.108
Look, I know the holidays
are hard in your situation,

34:41.176 --> 34:44.444
But don't worry.
You'll be married
again in a year.

34:44.512 --> 34:46.213
What?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.414
I'm sorry.

34:48.482 --> 34:51.683
I always forget...
nobody wants to think
they're a type.

34:53.052 --> 34:54.319
Merry Christmas.

34:54.387 --> 34:56.721
Merry Christmas.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.127
Harry.
Your turn.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.032
sorry sorry sorry.

35:34.235 --> 35:35.935
Shit.

35:54.525 --> 35:57.060
I don't see anything.

35:57.128 --> 35:58.662
Oh.
Here they are.

35:58.730 --> 36:01.664
- I got 'em.
- Great.

36:01.732 --> 36:03.296
<i>Be right there.</i>

36:08.392 --> 36:10.957
- Forgot his keys.
- I'll give you
a half an hour

36:11.025 --> 36:13.191
- And then we'll meet
you at Chumley's.
- Make it an hour.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.759
- Might have to get
some food in him.
- He's pathetic.

36:24.967 --> 36:26.801
Hello?

36:30.037 --> 36:32.071
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

36:34.341 --> 36:36.475
Switched my plans a little bit.

36:43.182 --> 36:45.649
I'm getting you aspirin.
Don't say no.

36:47.685 --> 36:49.352
Top right cabinet.

36:54.124 --> 36:56.792
<i>- How about some food?
- No.</i>

37:20.748 --> 37:23.517
- Thank you.
- Okay.

37:23.584 --> 37:25.385
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.665
Don't.

37:40.234 --> 37:42.068
Don't what?

38:00.721 --> 38:02.254
You smell so good.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.856
I feel dizzy.

38:53.171 --> 38:54.071
My goodness.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.209
I know.

39:09.154 --> 39:11.021
Oh! I'm supposed
to meet somebody.

39:12.756 --> 39:14.990
Oh.

39:19.328 --> 39:20.895
I should really go.

39:23.932 --> 39:25.566
You sure?

39:25.634 --> 39:26.501
Yes.

39:50.322 --> 39:52.123
I, uh...

39:54.192 --> 39:56.693
I understand.
It's okay.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.963
Okay.

40:01.701 --> 40:04.274
See you tomorrow, I guess.

40:40.332 --> 40:41.632
Freddy.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.035
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.

40:44.103 --> 40:45.737
It was the cleanest spot
in the office.

40:47.941 --> 40:51.343
Are you okay?
You didn't come
to the party.

40:51.411 --> 40:54.146
Oh.

40:54.214 --> 40:56.882
It's been my experience

40:56.950 --> 40:58.384
That when they give you
that Santa suit,

40:58.452 --> 41:00.987
There's usually a bottle
already in the pocket.

41:01.055 --> 41:03.157
Oh.

41:03.224 --> 41:05.125
thank God.

41:05.193 --> 41:07.595
I don't want to worry
that every time I hurt
your feelings

41:07.662 --> 41:10.298
You're gonna
start drinking again.

41:10.365 --> 41:12.667
Then why don't you stop
hurting my feelings?

41:18.374 --> 41:20.408
I'm sorry.

41:20.476 --> 41:23.077
I'm sorry I said
you were old-fashioned.

41:25.080 --> 41:28.514
And I'm sorry I said
you wanted to get married.

41:31.418 --> 41:33.085
<i>I do want to get married.</i>

41:33.153 --> 41:36.088
Well, you've got to work less
and find somebody.

41:36.156 --> 41:38.558
I have a boyfriend.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.426
Is it serious?

41:40.494 --> 41:42.429
I don't know yet.

41:43.665 --> 41:45.366
He won't leave me alone.

41:45.433 --> 41:48.936
It was that way with Violet.

41:49.004 --> 41:50.938
Insatiable.

41:51.006 --> 41:52.740
Oh.

41:52.808 --> 41:55.780
Oh.
Freddy, I don't want
to talk about this.

41:55.848 --> 41:57.915
Hey, you brought it up.

42:00.052 --> 42:02.253
I haven't done
much work on this,
I have to be honest.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.355
I need to get some coffee.

42:04.423 --> 42:06.292
Fine.

42:14.037 --> 42:15.571
I don't want to be alone
on new year's eve.

42:19.043 --> 42:21.914
My two cents?

42:21.981 --> 42:24.080
If you're gonna marry him,
you can't do anything.

42:24.148 --> 42:25.812
He won't respect you.

42:25.880 --> 42:29.044
What if I don't know?

42:29.112 --> 42:31.642
Well, you can't lead him on.

42:31.710 --> 42:33.775
That is physically
very uncomfortable.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.541
It's not a joke.

42:54.423 --> 42:57.592
did you enjoy the
fuhrer's birthday?

42:57.660 --> 42:59.194
may he live for
a thousand years.

43:01.865 --> 43:04.366
Oh, my father used to say
this is the greatest job
in the world

43:04.434 --> 43:06.368
Except for one thing...
the clients.

43:16.178 --> 43:19.146
Good morning.

43:19.213 --> 43:20.279
Did you make it home
last night?

43:20.347 --> 43:22.813
I did.
I did.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.446
Come inside.

43:30.648 --> 43:32.882
- What's all this?
- For your children.

43:32.949 --> 43:34.450
I bought them the other day,

43:34.517 --> 43:36.118
But I finally got them wrapped.

43:37.386 --> 43:38.686
Thank you.

43:38.754 --> 43:40.488
Want me to get the door?

43:40.555 --> 43:42.256
No.

43:42.324 --> 43:44.691
Do you need some coffee?

43:44.759 --> 43:46.526
I had some.

43:46.593 --> 43:48.293
It was quite a party.

43:49.896 --> 43:52.530
- I really overdid it.
- Me too.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.100
I, uh...

44:01.303 --> 44:03.203
Thank you for bringing my keys.

44:03.271 --> 44:06.206
I really appreciate it.

44:06.274 --> 44:08.108
I've probably
taken advantage
of your kindness

44:08.176 --> 44:10.177
On too many occasions.

44:11.646 --> 44:13.648
Excuse me?

44:16.185 --> 44:18.320
I just wanted
to say thank you
for bringing my keys.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.127
Okay.

44:26.730 --> 44:30.467
I know we talked about
how tough things are
for the firm,

44:32.402 --> 44:35.004
But I wanted you to know...

44:38.274 --> 44:41.642
Well, here's the bonus
we talked about.

44:45.580 --> 44:47.046
Merry Christmas.

44:49.983 --> 44:51.416
Thank you.

44:54.787 --> 44:56.821
Anything else for right now?

44:56.888 --> 44:58.455
No.

46:06.827 --> 46:08.127
Hey.

46:10.897 --> 46:13.398
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, of course.

46:15.434 --> 46:17.268
