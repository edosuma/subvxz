00:19.402 --> 00:20.653
Outside!

00:58.898 --> 01:00.757
We got one to go!

01:00.857 --> 01:03.192
One out to go! All right.

01:05.694 --> 01:06.695
Okay!

01:07.195 --> 01:11.115
- Be careful with your ass, Brewster.
- We got two outs.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.042
- Come on, Rudy!
- Hit it, Rudy!

01:35.930 --> 01:38.223
- Foul ball!
- Aw, foul ball?

01:38.848 --> 01:42.292
Aw, you almost had that. I bet you feel
like a big piece of shit, don't you?

01:42.392 --> 01:44.060
Talk all you want, Porky.

01:45.603 --> 01:47.879
Here we go, Monty.
Right into Porky's glove.

01:47.979 --> 01:49.772
Throw it in to Porky!

01:53.442 --> 01:54.426
Foul ball!

01:54.526 --> 01:56.402
Aw, foul ball again!

01:57.569 --> 01:58.594
It's all right, Rudy.

01:58.694 --> 02:00.220
Want me to have him
pitch underhanded to ya?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.555
Hey, I lettin' my bat
do my talking, lard ass!

02:02.655 --> 02:05.057
- Oh, the bat's got the brains!
- Play ball.

02:05.157 --> 02:06.474
All right. I just want to figure it out!

02:06.574 --> 02:08.741
That's all. I want to know who's got
the brains in the family.

02:11.786 --> 02:13.746
- Time out!
- Time out?

02:31.763 --> 02:34.289
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

02:34.389 --> 02:36.040
Come on, take it easy now.
Don't lose your concentration.

02:36.140 --> 02:39.141
Don't lose my concentration? The goddamned
train's coming through the outfield!

02:54.531 --> 02:56.366
There's a guy out there in the bleachers,

02:56.616 --> 02:59.018
front row, he's got a hat, camera.

02:59.118 --> 03:01.578
He's taking pictures of me
for the last three games.

03:04.622 --> 03:06.707
I'm tellin' ya.
I think he's a scout for the big leagues.

03:07.249 --> 03:09.817
Monty, this is Hackensack, New Jersey.

03:09.917 --> 03:12.127
No scout comes here, you understand?

03:12.418 --> 03:14.628
A train's goin' through
the outfield right now.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.987
But if you strike this guy out, I'll take you
with me tonight, we'll get you drunk.

03:18.087 --> 03:21.090
That's a promise. Two outs. Two! Two!

03:21.882 --> 03:23.133
Play ball!

03:25.385 --> 03:27.828
Two outs. Two outs.

03:27.928 --> 03:29.596
He makes three.

03:34.142 --> 03:36.352
Look at him. He's a little rag doll!

03:43.817 --> 03:45.693
Knock it a long distance for me!

03:50.864 --> 03:52.557
Hey, old man, getting a little tired, huh?

03:52.657 --> 03:54.659
Get back to T-ball, buddy.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.624
Strike three! You're out!

04:07.337 --> 04:08.963
Big win! Yeah!

04:09.880 --> 04:11.965
All right. Big win!

04:14.800 --> 04:16.034
Constantly scheming

04:16.134 --> 04:18.077
Forever dreaming

04:18.177 --> 04:20.161
If I can't get what I want

04:20.262 --> 04:22.330
Life just ain't worth livin'

04:22.430 --> 04:23.597
No

04:25.390 --> 04:26.724
Hey, honey!

04:29.685 --> 04:33.855
Oh, living in materialistic reality

04:34.188 --> 04:37.649
Only taking what you want
Oh, don't you see

04:38.191 --> 04:41.277
Do you live in a materialistic reality

04:43.195 --> 04:46.264
I'm a gypsy.
That's why I'm not gonna bullshit you, okay?

04:46.364 --> 04:49.058
I could tell you, "I'll see you next year."
I'm not gonna see you next year.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.142
Because I'm gonna be playing
with the big leagues.

04:51.242 --> 04:52.618
- Really?
- That's right.

04:53.243 --> 04:56.270
I don't know what team,
but you'll see me on television

04:56.370 --> 04:57.896
and you'll say to your friends,

04:57.996 --> 05:01.482
"I know that guy!
That's the guy that wanted to date me,

05:01.582 --> 05:03.542
"but, no, I was too stupid."

05:04.501 --> 05:06.777
Jake here. I'm in Hackensack.

05:06.877 --> 05:08.778
Ah, pretty much the same picture.
He was out drinkin'

05:08.878 --> 05:11.280
till 3:30 in a bar last night,

05:11.380 --> 05:14.157
then he picked up some girl
and took her back to the hotel.

05:14.257 --> 05:16.450
I figure tonight's agenda
looks about the same.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.868
He's in a bar celebrating his victory.

05:18.968 --> 05:20.302
Yeah, he was the winning pitcher today.

05:20.552 --> 05:23.037
Yeah, right now,
you're playing for Hackensack.

05:23.137 --> 05:26.081
So what are you doing
in a Cubs jersey, huh?

05:26.181 --> 05:28.999
A Cubs jersey? What are you talkin' about?
Hey, what number is that?

05:29.099 --> 05:30.166
Says "35."

05:30.266 --> 05:31.875
That was my number when
I played with the Cubs.

05:31.975 --> 05:35.311
They were the only big league team
smart enough to let me play for 'em.

05:35.853 --> 05:38.897
Is he a good pitcher? He's enthusiastic.

05:39.981 --> 05:41.857
Kinda like a kid in a candy store,
you know what I mean?

05:43.233 --> 05:45.026
Excuse me. Excuse me.

05:45.359 --> 05:47.569
Cold beer here. Cold beer.

05:48.861 --> 05:51.488
There you go. Sorry I'm late. Allow me.

05:53.740 --> 05:56.075
- Attractive.
- Thank you very much.

05:58.702 --> 06:00.978
Look, just keep
your eye out for Rudy, will you?

06:01.078 --> 06:02.954
He doesn't exist. There is no Rudy.

06:03.329 --> 06:06.856
Yes, sir. I'll break the news to
him first thing tomorrow morning.

06:06.956 --> 06:08.916
No, sir, I won't lose sight of him.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.293
Let me tell you something about athletes.

06:11.584 --> 06:14.736
I mean, after a game,
we've got to relax, we gotta come down.

06:14.836 --> 06:16.779
Unwind. My doctor told me. He said,

06:16.879 --> 06:20.323
"Hey, Brewster.
Man, get a massage. Come down."

06:20.423 --> 06:23.533
We were reading in a medical journal that
was left in the locker room the other day,

06:23.633 --> 06:26.994
an article by this
Oriental doctor on massages.

06:27.094 --> 06:29.954
See, we in the West
give a massage like this, you know.

06:30.054 --> 06:34.331
And, uh, see, all the energy coming
from my hands is stopped by the fabric.

06:34.431 --> 06:38.518
Apparently we in the West don't know that,
and we're massagin' for nothin'.

06:38.768 --> 06:41.670
So his theory, and it's just a theory,

06:41.770 --> 06:45.231
is that if you're nude and you get a
massage, that's the best thing for ya.

06:45.373 --> 06:46.815
Good for your muscles, nude.

06:46.915 --> 06:50.692
We're wonderin' maybe you might like
to, uh, try the theory nude with us.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.777
- The four of us nude would be great!
- Oh, that would be fun.

06:53.877 --> 06:55.545
- Massaging each other.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.380
I think they're kind of cute.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.381
This one's especially cute.

06:59.589 --> 07:01.156
Either you guys got a car?

07:01.256 --> 07:02.281
- No.
- Got a bus!

07:02.381 --> 07:04.699
- The Bulls' bus. The team bus.
- Bigger than a car.

07:04.799 --> 07:08.576
Oh, much bigger and more fun,
because he's the party-meister, himself.

07:08.676 --> 07:09.910
I'm the driver too.

07:10.010 --> 07:12.286
- Why don't we start in a bus?
- Why don't we try the bus?

07:12.386 --> 07:14.871
- Let's try the bus. Any left?
- We'll show you the bus.

07:14.971 --> 07:15.972
Any left?

07:16.806 --> 07:20.375
I'll try the bus.
A good place to start the evening off.

07:20.475 --> 07:24.462
You're gonna love this. We have a
big-screen TV. Well, we haven't got it yet.

07:24.562 --> 07:27.356
We got a space for a big-screen TV
I think you're gonna like.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.468
You know...

07:32.568 --> 07:33.902
Hi, guys.

07:37.030 --> 07:39.907
Uh. Rudy! Hi, Rudy, buddy!

07:43.577 --> 07:46.187
Get in the car
before I twist your head off.

07:46.287 --> 07:47.812
I didn't do anything wrong, baby.

07:47.912 --> 07:49.479
They tried to pick us up.

07:49.579 --> 07:50.646
Bullshit!

07:50.746 --> 07:52.647
Shut up! You too.
Get in the goddamned car!

07:52.747 --> 07:54.356
- Don't wanna get in the car.
- Hey, I wouldn't do that.

07:54.456 --> 07:57.417
- Uh, Rudy...
- Hey! Butt out, rag arm!

07:57.667 --> 07:58.984
Let's go, guys.

07:59.084 --> 08:00.627
Ha! We'll push your face!

08:00.877 --> 08:02.778
Yeah, police?
This is Torchy's on J Street.

08:02.878 --> 08:05.338
You'd better send somebody down here.
There's gonna be a fight.

08:16.723 --> 08:17.748
Ooh!

08:17.848 --> 08:18.890
Ow!

08:25.686 --> 08:28.671
Why is it when there's trouble,
we're the ones that get into it?

08:28.771 --> 08:32.591
There was a bar full of people.
We're the only ones in jail.

08:32.691 --> 08:36.009
I don't think it's racial, you know,
because I'm in here with you.

08:36.109 --> 08:37.400
That's comforting.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.679
Hiya, fellas.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.222
- Charley.
- Hey, Charley.

08:45.322 --> 08:49.284
Look, I don't know what to say,
but I guess this is it.

08:49.784 --> 08:51.268
Charley, we apologized.

08:51.368 --> 08:53.686
Now cut the speeches,
and get us out of here, please.

08:53.786 --> 08:57.856
I can't do it, kid. The front office is
washing its hands of you two.

08:57.956 --> 09:01.191
There's no money for bail
and no money for your fines.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.567
They gave the both of you
your unconditional releases.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.818
That's just great.
Do they know what they're talking about?

09:05.918 --> 09:09.279
We got one game left.
If we win today, we're in the play-offs!

09:09.379 --> 09:11.864
It's simple. They don't want you guys.

09:11.964 --> 09:14.532
Next year, they're going
with the college draft choices.

09:14.632 --> 09:16.300
New talent. Young kids.

09:16.883 --> 09:18.659
Hey, look at it this way, Brewster.

09:18.759 --> 09:23.054
You're lucky. You got to be
a pro ballplayer for 15 years.

09:23.471 --> 09:25.473
That's a lot more than most people get.

09:26.682 --> 09:28.100
I'll see ya.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.818
Brewster and Nolan.

09:38.485 --> 09:41.237
Okay! You bozos are up to bat.

09:41.445 --> 09:43.989
In here. Let's go!

09:58.169 --> 09:59.987
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of everything.

10:00.087 --> 10:01.738
- I know this kind of stuff.
- Don't mess up.

10:01.838 --> 10:03.214
Just smile.

10:06.508 --> 10:08.468
Thank you very much.

10:09.010 --> 10:14.161
Mr. Brewster and Mr. Nolan,
you're charged with assault and battery,

10:14.261 --> 10:18.498
resisting arrest, and destruction
of private property.

10:18.598 --> 10:20.600
How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?

10:21.017 --> 10:22.751
Oh, guilty but with a real good excuse.

10:22.851 --> 10:24.919
You're gonna love it, really.
I think everyone here will.

10:25.019 --> 10:26.878
I plead innocent.

10:26.978 --> 10:29.046
You see, Your Honor, what you have here

10:29.146 --> 10:33.108
with Mr. Brewster and myself,
is a couple of, well, local heroes, really.

10:33.233 --> 10:38.012
We play for a local team. You might
have seen us. The Hackensack Bulls?

10:38.112 --> 10:40.222
Perhaps you know the...
"Go, you Bulls, go."

10:40.322 --> 10:42.265
Let's not waste the court's time.

10:42.365 --> 10:45.642
I have depositions here
from over a dozen eyewitnesses.

10:45.742 --> 10:49.562
Your Honor, we went into the bar to
have a drink, and we saw this nice lady,

10:49.662 --> 10:52.897
and we asked her to sit with us to have
a drink, I didn't know she had a fiance.

10:52.997 --> 10:53.980
- Who knew?
- Did you know?

10:54.080 --> 10:56.606
- I didn't know. It wasn't public knowledge.
- I didn't know, either.

10:56.706 --> 11:00.943
So you were making advances to a woman
who was clearly involved with another man.

11:01.043 --> 11:05.187
You see, if you don't make calls,
you don't make any sales.

11:05.287 --> 11:06.946
This man does not represent me,
Your Honor.

11:07.046 --> 11:09.114
I would remove that
from the court records. I would...

11:09.214 --> 11:12.900
I'm going to set your bail at $3,000.

11:13.008 --> 11:14.175
Not bad.

11:14.275 --> 11:16.660
- We don't have $3,000.
- We don't.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.579
Bailiff, will you remove the prisoners?
Next case.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.164
Your Honor, wait.
Please, before you send us to jail...

11:22.264 --> 11:24.582
Look, I tried to defend myself.
The man hit me first.

11:25.724 --> 11:26.749
With the permission of the court...

11:26.849 --> 11:28.958
My name is J.B. Donaldo,

11:29.058 --> 11:32.919
and I'm representing parties who
wish to remain anonymous at this time

11:33.019 --> 11:36.230
and who have instructed me
to post bail for the defendants

11:36.330 --> 11:39.816
or pay any fines levied
in case they plead guilty,

11:39.916 --> 11:41.834
which I'm sure they will now do.

11:42.209 --> 11:44.152
- Yeah. Who is he?
- It's the scout.

11:44.252 --> 11:47.628
- Oh, yeah.
- I told you they want me.

11:48.211 --> 11:51.631
- They want me. We're goin' to the big time!
- This is it.

11:51.839 --> 11:54.282
- So where to, J.B.?
- New York.

11:54.382 --> 11:57.701
New York? Yeehaw!

11:57.801 --> 11:59.302
The Mets!

12:34.920 --> 12:36.863
I knew it! I knew it!

12:36.963 --> 12:39.256
There's no Mets in here! Wait a minute.

12:39.881 --> 12:41.448
Don't go in there.
There's no Mets in this building!

12:41.548 --> 12:43.533
I never said anything about the Mets.
Mr. Brewster did.

12:43.633 --> 12:45.617
I was just hired
to find him and bring him here.

12:45.717 --> 12:47.785
This is not a scout. He's a cop, Monty.
That's what he is.

12:47.885 --> 12:50.620
He's a cop. Look at him.
Look at those cheap cop shoes,

12:50.720 --> 12:54.140
cop face, cop hat, cop shirt, cop eyes!

12:54.598 --> 12:56.332
Monty, the Mets don't want you, all right?

12:56.432 --> 12:58.458
Hell, the Hackensack Bulls
don't even want ya.

12:58.558 --> 13:01.710
Look, I ain't supposed
to tell you this, but here's who hired me.

13:01.810 --> 13:05.313
Granville and Baxter. As far as I know, they
got nothin' to do with the Mets.

13:05.938 --> 13:07.356
It's goin' great.

13:13.195 --> 13:14.821
It's the Yankees.

13:15.988 --> 13:17.656
- Mr. Brewster?
- Right.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.641
- We've been expected you.
- The arm's okay.

13:20.741 --> 13:23.226
- Beg your pardon?
- The operation was a success.

13:23.326 --> 13:25.411
The arm's two years old now.

13:26.495 --> 13:27.829
Follow me, please.

13:29.372 --> 13:30.414
Wait for me.

13:51.685 --> 13:53.086
Mr. Brewster's here.

13:53.186 --> 13:56.105
- Mr. Brewster? I'm Ed Roundfield.
- Yeah.

13:56.605 --> 13:58.631
This is Mr. George Granville.
Mr. Norris Baxter.

13:58.731 --> 13:59.673
- How do you do?
- Hi.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.798
How do you do?

14:00.898 --> 14:02.924
Perhaps you'd better
sit down, Mr. Brewster.

14:03.024 --> 14:06.010
What I'm about to tell you
may come as quite a shock.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.428
No, sir. I don't want to sit down.
I want to hear this standing up.

14:08.528 --> 14:11.489
- Have you ever heard the name Rupert Horn?
- Rupert Horn.

14:12.239 --> 14:15.683
No. I bet he's someone
high up in the Yankee organization, right?

14:15.783 --> 14:18.577
I'm afraid not, Mr. Brewster.
Rupert Horn was your great-uncle.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.686
What's that got to do with baseball?

14:20.786 --> 14:23.354
Rupert Horn quarreled
with his family back in the '30s.

14:23.454 --> 14:24.813
He went out West.

14:24.913 --> 14:27.690
They never heard from him again.
They thought he was dead.

14:27.790 --> 14:29.792
But he didn't die until last month.

14:30.167 --> 14:33.128
And by then, he was
one of the richest men in America.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.112
And he bought a baseball team, right?

14:35.212 --> 14:37.197
No, oil and real estate.

14:37.297 --> 14:41.426
And you, Mr. Brewster, are the sole living
heir of your great-uncle, Rupert Horn.

14:41.801 --> 14:45.930
I think it's only fair to tell Mr. Brewster
about the conditions of the will.

14:49.475 --> 14:52.210
Brewster, greetings from the grave.

14:52.310 --> 14:53.543
Don't look so surprised.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.587
Didn't you know
your great-grandfather was a honky?

14:56.687 --> 15:00.982
The old man married twice.
One wife, white, produced me.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.651
One wife, black,
produced your grandmother.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.219
A checkered family, you might say.

15:07.319 --> 15:09.821
I've outlived them all, except you.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.682
They tell me you're
my only living relative, Brewster.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.975
And I got to say I'm very disappointed.
Look at you!

15:16.075 --> 15:20.412
What have you made of yourself?
A failed baseball player.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.998
I believe in being honest, Brewster.
No bullshit.

15:24.665 --> 15:26.375
I'm stuck with you.

15:27.834 --> 15:32.179
But we're going to have some fun.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.580
Let me...

15:44.680 --> 15:47.641
Let me tell you a little story, Brewster.

15:48.933 --> 15:53.018
When I was seven years old,
my daddy caught me smokin' a cigar.

15:54.561 --> 15:57.004
Locked me in the closet for
three days and three nights

15:57.104 --> 16:00.524
with nothin' but
a box of cigars and a book of matches.

16:01.149 --> 16:04.593
No food, Brewster.
No water, just those goddamned cigars.

16:04.693 --> 16:07.762
Wouldn't let me out
until I finished every last one.

16:07.862 --> 16:09.221
Taught me one hell of a lesson.

16:09.321 --> 16:12.782
I'm going to do to you
what my daddy did to me.

16:13.157 --> 16:16.101
I'm gonna teach you
to hate spending money.

16:16.201 --> 16:17.852
I'm gonna make you
so sick of spending money

16:17.952 --> 16:22.022
that the mere sight of it
will make you want to throw up.

16:22.122 --> 16:24.457
So, here's my proposition.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.712
You have 30 days in which
to spend 30 million bucks.

16:31.046 --> 16:34.281
If you can do it, you get 300 million.

16:34.381 --> 16:35.615
There's gotta be a catch.

16:35.715 --> 16:37.491
Of course there's a catch.

16:37.591 --> 16:39.659
You have to spend the 30 million,

16:39.759 --> 16:43.912
but after 30 days, you're
not allowed to own any assets.

16:44.012 --> 16:48.681
No houses, no cars, no jewelry,
nothin' but the shirt on your back.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.624
Sounds easy, don't it?

16:51.724 --> 16:54.626
Well, you'll find out!

16:54.726 --> 16:57.562
No, no, no, no.

16:58.396 --> 16:59.397
Now...

17:00.731 --> 17:04.633
You can hire anybody you want, but you
got to get value for their services.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.093
You can donate 5% to charity,

17:07.193 --> 17:10.095
and you can gamble another 5% away,

17:10.194 --> 17:12.221
but you can't give this money away.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.573
And that includes buying the Hope Diamond
for some bimbo as a birthday present.

17:18.992 --> 17:21.935
I know what you're thinking, Brewster.

17:22.036 --> 17:26.373
You'll buy yourself a dozen Picassos
and use them for firewood, right?

17:26.623 --> 17:30.001
Wrong! You must not destroy

17:30.185 --> 17:31.544
what is inherently valuable.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.520
That's instant disqualification.

17:34.437 --> 17:36.897
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

17:38.315 --> 17:42.217
You're not allowed to tell anybody
why you have to spend this money.

17:42.317 --> 17:43.735
Why can't I tell my friends?

17:44.152 --> 17:46.011
Because I don't want
anybody helpin' you out!

17:46.111 --> 17:49.489
Nobody helped me out
in that closet with those cigars.

17:49.864 --> 17:51.031
I never had any friends.

17:52.699 --> 17:56.285
Well, Brewster, what do you think?
You got the balls for it?

17:58.412 --> 18:03.208
I doubt it. That's why I put a
special wimp clause in my will.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.461
You can have a million dollars,
right now, forget the whole thing.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.922
Or you can go for the big one, Brewster.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.673
The 300 million.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.716
But if you fail,

18:16.883 --> 18:19.719
you don't get diddly.

18:28.936 --> 18:31.296
This is the million dollars
your great-uncle spoke about.

18:31.396 --> 18:35.358
Oh, Jesus! I've never seen
that much money in my life!

18:35.608 --> 18:38.777
We've investigated your background,
Mr. Brewster.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.346
The highest salary
you've ever had is $11,000

18:42.446 --> 18:44.931
for one season with the Toledo Mud Hens.

18:45.031 --> 18:48.075
You've never had a credit card
in your entire life.

18:48.575 --> 18:51.727
Think of spending
a million dollars a day for 30 days

18:51.827 --> 18:53.787
with no assets to show for it.

18:54.162 --> 18:57.748
It's quite difficult to spend money
without accumulating assets,

18:58.331 --> 18:59.898
even when the money is spent foolishly.

18:59.998 --> 19:04.777
Surely, no one could blame you for
refusing such an eccentric gamble.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.130
That's good advice. Take the million.

19:08.755 --> 19:09.756
It's yours!

19:10.423 --> 19:13.492
What happens if I don't take
the million dollars and I,

19:13.592 --> 19:16.077
I try for the whole thing and I fail?

19:16.177 --> 19:19.163
Granville and Baxter would gain
power of attorney over the estate.

19:19.263 --> 19:21.682
They would administer it
in some charitable fashion

19:21.890 --> 19:24.392
for a considerable fee, I'm sure.

19:24.767 --> 19:27.728
- What do you think?
- I don't benefit either way, Mr. Brewster.

19:28.311 --> 19:30.271
I'm a completely neutral observer.

19:35.901 --> 19:39.070
Whew. "Bird in the hand..."

19:39.779 --> 19:42.406
That's what my grandmother used to say.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.691
I'm gonna go for the 300 million.

19:53.791 --> 19:58.361
When you appear before us again in 30 days,
Mr. Brewster, you must be totally penniless,

19:58.461 --> 20:00.446
without assets of any kind,

20:00.546 --> 20:03.865
having nothing but the receipt for your
expenses and the clothes on your back.

20:03.965 --> 20:06.408
Are you certain
you want to do this, Mr. Brewster?

20:06.508 --> 20:09.743
No, sir, I'm not certain,
but I'm gonna have a lot of fun findin' out.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.494
Send Drake up here immediately.

20:11.594 --> 20:14.305
Good luck, sir.
You're due back in 30 days.

20:14.596 --> 20:16.472
Gentlemen, shall we say...

20:17.055 --> 20:19.307
...12:00 midnight exactly?

20:19.557 --> 20:21.875
We're going to assign
one of our paralegals

20:21.975 --> 20:26.086
from the accounting department to keep track
of your expenditures and receipts.

20:26.186 --> 20:28.045
Does this guy Drake know
about the 300 million?

20:28.145 --> 20:31.422
All Drake knows
is that you've inherited $30 million

20:31.522 --> 20:34.382
which must be precisely accounted for.

20:34.482 --> 20:39.011
You tell Drake the truth, you'll automatically
lose the entire inheritance.

20:39.111 --> 20:41.846
I ain't tellin' Drake shit.
My lips are sealed.

20:41.946 --> 20:44.222
Lock them.
Throw away the key. "Hello, Drake."

20:44.322 --> 20:47.641
This is the way I'll talk.
"How are you doing, Drake?"

20:47.741 --> 20:52.287
Miss Drake. This is Mr. Brewster,
the client we briefed you about.

20:53.830 --> 20:57.525
Oh, yes, Mr. Brewster.
It's very nice to meet you.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.694
- Damn. It doesn't rain, it pours.
- I beg your pardon?

21:00.794 --> 21:04.155
The $30 million is deposited
in a bank across the street.

21:04.255 --> 21:08.157
I imagine you'd like to make sure it's
real and possibly make a withdrawal.

21:08.257 --> 21:12.285
- Yeah, I'd like to make sure it's real.
- Step this way, please.

21:12.385 --> 21:14.345
- Hey, good luck.
- Yes, sir.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.604
- Spike! Spike!
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

21:23.937 --> 21:25.713
- What's wrong? Are you all right?
- Spike! Spike!

21:25.813 --> 21:29.049
- You look like you've seen a ghost!
- I did! But I'm not.

21:29.149 --> 21:30.633
I'm okay. It's gonna be great.

21:30.733 --> 21:31.717
We're gonna be back on the team.

21:31.817 --> 21:33.426
- In fact, I may own the team.
- What?

21:33.526 --> 21:35.093
Yeah, I'm gonna be
a little crazy for a while.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.886
But I'm not crazy.
People gonna think I'm crazy.

21:36.986 --> 21:38.094
You stick with me, you're my buddy.

21:38.194 --> 21:41.013
- You work here?
- No. No. They just hired me to follow you.

21:41.113 --> 21:44.390
Would you like to work for more money
than you ever made in your life?

21:44.490 --> 21:46.933
I mean, it's a job. It's gonna be...

21:47.033 --> 21:49.518
I gotta check out something,
see if it's real first. Are you interested?

21:49.618 --> 21:51.352
- Yeah! You kiddin'?
- Bring your camera.

21:51.452 --> 21:52.769
- Come on.
- What are you talking...

21:52.869 --> 21:54.603
Would you mind fillin' me in
on what the hell is going on?

21:54.703 --> 21:56.270
What's wrong?
What did they do to you in there?

21:56.370 --> 21:57.603
What do you mean,
what did they do to me in there?

21:57.703 --> 22:00.330
I think I just inherited $30 million!

22:01.873 --> 22:04.775
Oh, is that all?
I thought we did something wrong.

22:04.875 --> 22:07.151
$30 million.
Why didn't you tell me $30 million?

22:07.251 --> 22:08.835
$30 million? You kiddin' me?

22:10.086 --> 22:11.820
Like I'm gonna take money
from my best friend.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.362
Things like this just
don't happen every day!

22:13.462 --> 22:16.030
This is incredible news! $30 million!

22:16.130 --> 22:19.491
The man just got $30 million given to him.
This is a good day.

22:19.591 --> 22:20.908
We're always gonna remember this day.

22:21.008 --> 22:24.160
$30 million! That makes us rich!
Well, not us. It makes him rich.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.078
What a great day we're havin'! Me?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.829
He's havin' a wonderful day!

22:27.929 --> 22:30.890
But I'm havin' a good time too!
I'm his best friend.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.706
Jesus!

22:56.915 --> 23:00.627
This is real... Money.

23:02.420 --> 23:05.672
Oh, we're gonna have
a lot of fun with this kind of money.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.491
This is the real deal.

23:09.591 --> 23:11.175
It is, indeed, Mr. Brewster.

23:11.359 --> 23:12.926
Now let's not be rash with
our newfound money.

23:13.026 --> 23:14.051
Right.

23:14.151 --> 23:16.886
Jake, I'd like to hire you
as my official photographer.

23:16.986 --> 23:20.055
- Salary $10,000 a week.
- $10,000 a week? This guy's a jerk!

23:20.155 --> 23:22.490
Hey, shut up. I accept.

23:23.199 --> 23:25.409
Hey, hold still for the camera,
Mr. Brewster.

23:26.701 --> 23:29.853
Not bad for a guy that didn't finish his first
year of college, wouldn't you say?

23:29.953 --> 23:31.771
Oh, you're doing great, but, uh,

23:31.871 --> 23:34.648
I don't think you inherited me
with your money, Mr. Brewster.

23:34.748 --> 23:38.776
Needless to say, we'll be offering you
the special 24% interest rate

23:38.876 --> 23:42.504
we reserve for major corporations
and a few of our Arab friends.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.572
I don't want any interest!

23:44.672 --> 23:47.091
I want it in a regular account
that doesn't pay anything.

23:47.466 --> 23:49.742
After all, it's your vault.
I should be paying you rent.

23:49.842 --> 23:52.035
- Very good, Mr. Brewster.
- But Mr. Brewster...

23:52.135 --> 23:56.055
You'd be giving up $7.2 million
a year just in interest alone!

23:56.889 --> 23:59.666
Because I'm rich doesn't mean I should take
advantage of people. Am I right?

23:59.766 --> 24:02.501
Oh, yes. Right you are, Mr. Brewster.

24:02.601 --> 24:06.062
I'd like to get $3 million in cash
now and take it with me.

24:06.729 --> 24:09.506
$3 million? You know how much
money $3 million in cash is?

24:09.606 --> 24:11.549
You don't walk around
the street with $3 million!

24:11.649 --> 24:14.234
- You'd need an army of security guards.
- The man's right.

24:15.610 --> 24:16.635
What do they pay you here?

24:16.735 --> 24:18.636
About 350 a week before taxes.

24:18.736 --> 24:21.430
You can't live on that.
This is a dangerous job!

24:21.530 --> 24:24.557
I'll pay you $2,000 a week
to be the chief of my security.

24:24.657 --> 24:27.392
- No-no-no-no-no.
- Oh, yes. That's wrong. Okay.

24:27.492 --> 24:28.934
$4,000 a week.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.852
And you get 20 other guys,
and I'll pay 'em $3,000 a week.

24:31.952 --> 24:32.936
You missed the point.

24:33.036 --> 24:35.521
Now go in there and get
the $3 million and follow me!

24:35.621 --> 24:36.605
Yes, sir!

24:36.705 --> 24:38.039
Everybody, follow me!

24:38.414 --> 24:40.732
Monty, listen to me.
This is Spike, your old pal.

24:40.832 --> 24:42.917
You don't do things like that!

24:45.002 --> 24:47.195
Put it in a T-bill. Is that so wrong?

24:47.295 --> 24:48.654
Listen to me. What are you doin'?

24:48.754 --> 24:49.738
I'll tell you what's goin' on...

24:49.838 --> 24:51.948
- You don't even know those people!
- They're gonna think I'm crazy.

24:52.048 --> 24:54.157
But I'm not. You got to stick with me,
'cause this is it!

24:54.257 --> 24:56.325
- This is the way we're gonna beat the system!
- What system?

24:56.425 --> 24:59.994
The baseball system! You got more heart
than any catcher I've ever worked with, man.

25:00.094 --> 25:02.621
And I can get anybody out
for three innings, anybody!

25:02.721 --> 25:05.956
And with this inheritance, man,
this is our ticket to the big leagues!

25:06.056 --> 25:07.999
- You understand? You with me?
- No!

25:08.099 --> 25:10.267
- Well, yeah!
- Well, let's go!

25:13.061 --> 25:15.904
That's right.
That's right Take some pictures.

25:20.108 --> 25:21.675
I want everything on film.
I need a record of it.

25:21.775 --> 25:22.776
For what?

25:23.651 --> 25:24.676
Strike!

25:24.776 --> 25:27.344
Watch the goddamn ball, Johnson!

25:27.444 --> 25:31.113
You're not a farmer! You don't have
to swing at shit in the dirt!

25:32.280 --> 25:35.032
What? Collect call from who?

25:36.450 --> 25:38.559
Switchboard says it's Brewster.

25:38.659 --> 25:39.643
He's callin' me from jail.

25:39.743 --> 25:42.328
- Just what I need.
- Tell him he owes me 200 bucks.

25:44.079 --> 25:46.122
Yeah, I'll accept the call.

25:47.456 --> 25:51.650
Charley, I'm not drunk. I'm in New York,
and I just inherited 30 million bucks.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.444
I'm about to go
into negotiations to buy the team.

25:54.544 --> 25:56.236
Actually, I'm gonna rent the team.

25:56.336 --> 26:00.548
- Ball!
- What kind of a crap play is that?

26:00.839 --> 26:03.132
- Wilson, you idiot!
- You're out!

26:04.508 --> 26:07.761
You don't steal second
when you're down two runs!

26:08.970 --> 26:12.539
Brewster, do me a favor.
Go crazy on your own time and charges.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.041
This whole team's going to shit,
and we're gonna miss the play-offs.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.475
I ain't in the mood for no jokes!

26:16.766 --> 26:17.749
That's why I love you, Charley.

26:17.849 --> 26:20.543
And that's why I'm gonna raise your salary.
Because I love your dedication.

26:20.643 --> 26:22.645
Charley, I'm gonna get
the team new uniforms,

26:22.978 --> 26:25.981
a team bus with air conditioning and a TV!

26:26.147 --> 26:29.066
And we're arrange it
so that we can play the New York Yankees!

26:29.608 --> 26:32.969
Right. Right. Okay, just tell me
one thing, Mr. Millionaire.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.095
You're so rich,
why are you calling collect?

26:35.195 --> 26:37.221
They gave me $100 bills, Charley.

26:37.321 --> 26:39.323
I had to rent this quarter
from my accountant.

26:39.698 --> 26:43.993
Yeah, I know. It's a big problem.
Nighty-night, sweet prince.

26:44.451 --> 26:47.829
Nighty-night? Charley!
He doesn't believe me.

26:53.251 --> 26:55.319
Thanks for the loaning of the quarter.

26:55.419 --> 26:58.338
- Wow! Now, that's really nice.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

26:58.796 --> 27:00.655
But there is no way
I can see spending over

27:00.755 --> 27:03.573
a couple hundred thousand dollars
for something you wear around your neck.

27:03.673 --> 27:06.116
You know how many
hungry people that could feed?

27:06.216 --> 27:07.884
Let's go to lunch.

27:09.510 --> 27:10.928
Yo! Taxi!

27:13.764 --> 27:16.541
- Who the hell is that?
- Monty Brewster, the richest guy in the world.

27:16.641 --> 27:17.583
And I work for him.

27:17.683 --> 27:18.667
Monty who?

27:18.767 --> 27:23.671
How would you like to be my personal driver
for the next 30 days at $5,000 a week?

27:23.771 --> 27:27.298
You want to hire
a piece of shit car for $5,000 a week?

27:27.398 --> 27:29.674
- Cash!
- What a country!

27:29.774 --> 27:31.008
America, I love it!

27:31.108 --> 27:34.594
Mr. Brewster, you could hire
a fleet of limousines for that money!

27:34.694 --> 27:37.095
She's right.
You know where to hire limousines?

27:37.195 --> 27:38.220
Yeah.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.181
All right. I want you to hire me three of the
most expensive limousines with drivers,

27:42.281 --> 27:44.766
and bring the receipts
and give 'em to Miss Drake.

27:44.866 --> 27:46.534
- Yes, sir!
- We go to lunch now.

27:46.926 --> 27:49.428
Hey! Everybody!
Anybody want to go to lunch?

27:49.678 --> 27:50.662
I'm buying.

27:50.762 --> 27:52.472
Yeah!

27:54.807 --> 27:57.375
- I want pictures of this!
- Buzz off. I'm his personal photographer.

27:57.475 --> 28:00.544
Hey, what's this? Screw you!
This is a free country!

28:00.644 --> 28:02.771
What are you... Here. Focus on that!

28:04.606 --> 28:06.232
Come on, Spike!

28:06.649 --> 28:08.484
Wait for me, pal! Wait for me!

28:11.862 --> 28:12.904
Hey...

28:18.992 --> 28:20.368
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

28:22.036 --> 28:23.728
- What's your name?
- Melvin.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.330
- Melvin, give him $500.
- Yes, sir.

28:28.464 --> 28:32.334
- Look at all that money!
- You have the most beautiful eyes.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.277
Mr. Brewster, I have been
hired to keep your accounts

28:35.377 --> 28:37.987
for the next 30 days,
and that's the extent of my services.

28:38.087 --> 28:40.322
Uh, to where is our destination?

28:41.631 --> 28:42.948
Monty! How are you doin', pal?

28:43.048 --> 28:44.657
- Give me that.
- Watch it! Watch the lens!

28:44.757 --> 28:46.741
Chump, I'm Spike! We're right behind ya!

28:46.841 --> 28:49.051
That's Spike. We're buddies.
We're all together.

28:49.176 --> 28:51.327
I'll buy you a cab later, huh?

29:07.317 --> 29:09.760
Two hundred people at a $100 a head.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.387
No. We're hungry. $200 a head!

29:12.487 --> 29:14.555
And, uh, what's your most
expensive wine you have?

29:14.655 --> 29:18.283
Oh, that's the Chateau Lafite 1961.
It's $400 a bottle.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.017
You guys like Lafite?

29:20.117 --> 29:21.368
Yeah!

29:35.715 --> 29:39.176
Excuse my expression,
but you think I'm a real asshole, don't ya?

29:39.551 --> 29:43.079
A country bumpkin that flashes his money
around like some big shot?

29:43.179 --> 29:46.182
- I'm your accountant. I'm not your judge.
- What college you go to?

29:46.432 --> 29:48.666
I don't see that that has
anything to do with anything.

29:48.766 --> 29:49.999
Come on, give me a break.

29:50.099 --> 29:51.666
All I want to know
is what college you went to.

29:51.766 --> 29:54.835
- All right. I went to Loyola. That's in...
- Loyola.

29:54.935 --> 29:58.396
Chicago
I know the city, and I know the college.

30:01.899 --> 30:04.318
You wanna put that back?

30:06.987 --> 30:08.655
And the ashtray.

30:11.741 --> 30:13.767
Why don't you go sit somewhere else?

30:13.867 --> 30:15.184
Why don't you get off my back?

30:15.284 --> 30:17.435
And why don't you
use your fork, not your fingers.

30:17.535 --> 30:20.162
- That's how it's usually done. Yeah.
- Oh, is that right?

30:20.871 --> 30:24.249
Boss found a job for you yet, by the way?
Like designated eater?

30:25.166 --> 30:27.376
Look, I don't want a job. I'm his friend.

30:27.584 --> 30:28.943
What's that pay?

30:32.921 --> 30:35.239
Why don't you
let me hire someone to do that for you,

30:35.339 --> 30:36.840
and we could have a lot of fun tonight.

30:37.465 --> 30:40.242
Oh, that's very flattering,
but I'm meeting my fiance.

30:40.342 --> 30:41.576
Who's the lucky guy?

30:41.676 --> 30:44.661
Warren Cox. He's a junior partner
at Granville and Baxter.

30:44.761 --> 30:47.121
- Is he a lawyer too?
- He's not just a lawyer.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.832
He's involved with the Sierra Club,
anti-nuclear movement, UNICEF.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.060
- And he's a sincere feminist.
- I bet.

30:54.643 --> 30:58.128
But a guy like that with so many activities,
where's he find the time for you?

30:58.228 --> 30:59.962
It's hard sometimes.

31:00.062 --> 31:03.590
- But we're trying to do more things together.
- I'd like to meet him sometime.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.859
- He's a very busy man.
- I'd pay him for his time.

31:07.734 --> 31:09.385
I don't think so.

31:09.485 --> 31:13.012
I know you think you can buy up
everything and everybody in the world,

31:13.112 --> 31:16.598
but I doubt
that you could ever buy Warren.

31:16.698 --> 31:19.892
This is Chuck Fleming,
Action News, in midtown Manhattan.

31:19.992 --> 31:22.852
Now arriving at
the Plaza Hotel is Montgomery Brewster,

31:22.952 --> 31:25.270
minor league baseball pitcher
who earlier today

31:25.370 --> 31:28.105
inherited $30 million tax-free

31:28.205 --> 31:30.207
and is still celebrating.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.193
Mr. Brewster, what are you going to
do with all that money?

31:34.293 --> 31:36.402
Uh, spend it! No, just kidding.

31:36.502 --> 31:40.237
I'm forming a corporation tonight,
and tomorrow morning we go into business.

31:40.337 --> 31:42.030
What kind of business
is that, Mr. Brewster?

31:42.130 --> 31:45.449
What kind of business?
As you know, my business is baseball.

31:45.549 --> 31:48.743
But since I've inherited $30 million,
I have to expand and branch out.

31:48.843 --> 31:51.787
I've always had a soft spot
in my heart for artists and, uh,

31:51.887 --> 31:55.873
painters, writers, inventors...
And I'm gonna form this business.

31:55.973 --> 31:57.582
And I want everybody to get a shot.

31:57.682 --> 32:00.643
I don't care if you've been turned
down a thousand times, I'm hiring!

32:00.976 --> 32:03.419
How many people have you
hired already, Mr. Brewster?

32:03.519 --> 32:08.714
Uh, well, I think you should ask
my senior vice president, uh, Spike Nolan!

32:08.814 --> 32:10.632
- Yeah. Spike. I'm paying him...
- Ha!

32:10.732 --> 32:13.633
...$100,000 a month to figure that out.

32:13.733 --> 32:17.810
100,000! Did you hear? 100,000 a month!

32:17.910 --> 32:19.970
Chuck Fleming!

32:20.237 --> 32:23.139
- Hey, are we on the air now? Is this workin'?
- Yes. Right there.

32:23.239 --> 32:25.557
Can I say something to all the people
who thought I was a loser, Chuck?

32:25.657 --> 32:27.558
Sure.

32:27.658 --> 32:30.226
Thanks, Chuck! Hey, Monty! Monty!

32:30.326 --> 32:33.329
That was Spike Nolan,
he's the catcher for the Hackensack Bulls.

32:33.579 --> 32:36.898
Mr. Brewster, I would love to
accommodate you and your friends,

32:36.998 --> 32:40.084
but the top two floors
have already been reserved.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.735
They'll be occupied
within the next two weeks.

32:42.835 --> 32:46.196
- How much are they paying?
- $100,000 a week.

32:46.296 --> 32:48.673
- Oh.
- Wow. Mister, uh...

32:49.256 --> 32:50.924
- Carter.
- Mr. Carter.

32:51.633 --> 32:54.135
I like your hotel.
My friends like your hotel.

32:54.385 --> 32:56.870
- You like this hotel?
- I like this hotel. I love it.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.346
He loves it too.

32:58.530 --> 33:01.390
Listen. I'll tell you what.
For the next month,

33:01.490 --> 33:03.033
I'll pay you...

33:03.742 --> 33:06.286
$1 million in cash.

33:10.748 --> 33:12.615
Sign here, please.

33:42.737 --> 33:45.906
Hey, Melvin.
How are they hanging, my friend?

33:46.197 --> 33:49.491
Hey, you look good. Real big league.

34:00.543 --> 34:02.903
- Nice, huh?
- They're in the bedroom.

34:03.003 --> 34:04.988
Thanks for your help.

34:10.217 --> 34:13.844
Monty! Hey, old Monty, old pal!

34:15.096 --> 34:17.581
- Hey, pal, get a load of this, huh?
- Get a load of...

34:17.681 --> 34:21.081
What do you think? I found it all in one
shop, from the shoes all the way up to this.

34:21.181 --> 34:22.498
This was made for Johnny Bench.

34:22.599 --> 34:23.916
He didn't pick it up,
so they gave it to me.

34:24.016 --> 34:25.500
A catcher's mask!

34:25.600 --> 34:28.460
- Oh, Monty, I can't thank you enough.
- It's, uh...

34:28.560 --> 34:30.853
- What do you think, huh?
- Hey!

34:31.520 --> 34:33.338
- They just made that for you?
- Yeah.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.841
Wow. Honest? Too conservative for me.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.257
- Too... What are you talking...
- For me!

34:38.358 --> 34:41.927
- This is the new Spike Nolan here.
- I know, but this is great.

34:42.027 --> 34:44.178
Well, great on you,
but great is your accountant.

34:44.277 --> 34:45.469
Very nice.

34:45.570 --> 34:47.596
Yeah, she's nice,
but she thinks I'm a lowlife.

34:47.696 --> 34:50.431
- I can understand that.
- Get out of here! What are you talkin' about?

34:50.531 --> 34:52.224
Gentlemen, do you think I'm a lowlife?

34:52.324 --> 34:54.183
Oh, no, Mr. Brewster.

34:54.283 --> 34:56.976
- Not with these clothes.
- See what I mean?

34:57.076 --> 34:58.185
Ooh, and you listen to these people?

34:58.285 --> 34:59.995
Hey, look at all the suits I got.

35:01.705 --> 35:04.691
Now, look.
I know that this is none of my business,

35:04.791 --> 35:06.776
but at the rate you're going,
you'll have spent

35:06.876 --> 35:10.086
your entire inheritance in less than a month,
and you'll have nothing to show for it.

35:10.503 --> 35:14.590
Excuse me, sir. There's a Mr. Warren Cox
here to see Miss Drake.

35:15.465 --> 35:18.718
- Mr. Cox?
- Warren! How you doing?

35:19.218 --> 35:21.453
- Monty Brewster. Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.995
I've heard so much about you.

35:23.095 --> 35:27.265
My God. I hear you're a swell fellow.
We're drinking some champagne.

35:27.723 --> 35:28.724
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

35:29.558 --> 35:32.377
That's sweet. I'll get this.
Is it raining out?

35:32.477 --> 35:34.753
Not at the moment, but you never know.

35:34.853 --> 35:37.338
Better safe than sorry.
That's my philosophy too.

35:37.438 --> 35:40.424
- Uh, have a drink.
- Oh, thank you. No, I don't drink alcohol.

35:40.524 --> 35:42.300
Uh-oh. We're going to be late
for that benefit.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.633
- Benefit?
- Yes.

35:43.733 --> 35:45.426
It's the Committee to Ban Contact Sports.

35:45.526 --> 35:49.304
Studies have shown sanctioned violence has
a detrimental effect on our young people,

35:49.404 --> 35:52.514
so I do a little legal work
for the committee.

35:52.614 --> 35:54.849
You guys ain't messin' around
with baseball, are you?

35:54.949 --> 35:57.225
Baseball? No, no.
Boxing, football, ice hockey...

35:57.325 --> 35:59.643
- You know, the truly barbaric sports.
- Oh.

35:59.743 --> 36:01.995
I'd like to make a small contribution,
if I may.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.562
You know,
I think we're gonna be very late.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.689
Darling, this is what the benefit
is for, to raise money.

36:07.789 --> 36:09.732
In a sense,
we're at the benefit, right now.

36:09.832 --> 36:12.251
And so am I. $100,000 okay?

36:12.626 --> 36:17.088
$100,000? Thank you, very, very much.

36:17.588 --> 36:18.839
Here, have a drink.

36:19.214 --> 36:20.465
Thank you. I will.

36:21.257 --> 36:22.424
Warren, you don't even drink.

36:22.882 --> 36:25.658
- Well, one little sip won't hurt, dear.
- That's right.

36:27.458 --> 36:28.492
Mmm.

36:28.592 --> 36:31.702
This is a really wonderful suite
you have, Mr. Brewster.

36:31.802 --> 36:34.221
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yes. Oh, look at that.

36:34.471 --> 36:38.766
Two Louis XVI chairs
with a good tapestry fabric.

36:39.767 --> 36:42.478
That's a nice attempt
at a classic French piano.

36:43.270 --> 36:44.879
Marie Therese chandelier...

36:44.979 --> 36:46.838
Yeah, I see what your
decorator was trying to do here.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.424
There's a definite continuity
to all the elements in the room.

36:50.524 --> 36:52.842
Personally, I'd of done
a few things differently, but...

36:52.942 --> 36:55.569
- Mr. Cox, you know so much about this stuff.
- Well...

36:56.194 --> 36:59.930
My ex-wife Marilyn's a decorator,
and a lot of it rubbed off on me.

37:00.030 --> 37:02.240
- You know, you could really help me out.
- How's that?

37:03.074 --> 37:07.144
Well I'd like for you
to redecorate my offices.

37:07.244 --> 37:10.914
I'd pay you, of course. Uh, $250,000?

37:11.205 --> 37:13.457
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

37:14.708 --> 37:17.168
Mr. Brewster, I'm a lawyer.

37:17.626 --> 37:21.379
I'm sure New York is full of decorators who
would die for that kind of opportunity.

37:22.129 --> 37:25.447
Really, this is so out of left field,
to use a metaphor from your profession.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.532
If you think the job's
too big for you to handle, just say no.

37:27.632 --> 37:28.574
No.

37:28.674 --> 37:31.635
I mean, I'm not saying no. Not at all.
I'm not saying that.

37:31.885 --> 37:35.204
Warren, you're a lawyer.
You are not a decorator!

37:35.304 --> 37:37.413
There's nothing wrong
with being a decorator.

37:37.513 --> 37:39.038
Marilyn makes a rather good living at it.

37:39.138 --> 37:42.141
- That's it! Marilyn, she could help you.
- What?

37:42.474 --> 37:44.708
I'd pay her $100,000,
if that's not an insult.

37:44.808 --> 37:49.294
Well, I'd have to ask her,
but, uh, I think she'd be delighted.

37:49.394 --> 37:51.629
I mean, you were telling me
how you never get to see your fiance.

37:51.729 --> 37:53.755
This way, you get to see him every day.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.006
- Just trying to be helpful.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:56.106 --> 37:58.216
And what about your job
at the firm and our honeymoon?

37:58.316 --> 38:01.677
- Well, it would only be for a couple of weeks.
- Couple of weeks.

38:01.777 --> 38:02.861
We've got a whole lifetime
for our honeymoon.

38:03.152 --> 38:04.153
A whole lifetime.

38:04.444 --> 38:07.655
- It's been a pleasure meeting you. Monty?
- Warren.

38:08.298 --> 38:10.283
Angela wanted me to phone up
from the lobby, but, no,

38:10.383 --> 38:14.161
I thought would come up here
and meet you, mano-a-mano.

38:14.261 --> 38:17.097
- I'm glad I did.
- Warren, me too.

38:17.472 --> 38:21.601
- Let's go, Warren.
- You're leaving? Oh, goodness, no.

38:22.101 --> 38:23.894
Hey, wait a minute!

38:24.769 --> 38:27.838
- Better safe than sorry.
- Good night, Mr. Brewster.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.981
Hey, call me Monty. Warren does.

38:31.190 --> 38:33.258
Hey, let me get the door.

38:33.358 --> 38:37.011
- Thank you. Yes. I will.
- And you drive careful.

38:37.111 --> 38:38.511
- Good night. Nice meeting you.
- Good night.

38:38.611 --> 38:40.279
Nice meeting you.

38:42.030 --> 38:44.240
Now that was a real asshole!

38:46.909 --> 38:51.330
You want a month off
to be Mr. Brewster's interior decorator?

38:51.997 --> 38:56.192
I, uh, realize that it's
a rather unorthodox request,

38:56.292 --> 38:58.335
but it's an incredible opportunity.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.694
He actually wants me
to start working for him this morning

39:00.794 --> 39:02.462
in, uh, about 20 minutes.

39:03.588 --> 39:04.672
How much is he paying you?

39:05.130 --> 39:06.506
A quarter of million dollars, sir.

39:15.263 --> 39:18.373
Yes, we understand
that kind of opportunity.

39:18.473 --> 39:20.933
I think a leave of absence
can be arranged.

39:21.433 --> 39:23.542
As I'm sure you know,

39:23.642 --> 39:27.295
Mr. Horn was our most important client.

39:27.395 --> 39:29.713
And the firm is naturally concerned with

39:29.813 --> 39:33.024
how Mr. Brewster
conducts himself with his inheritance.

39:33.983 --> 39:36.051
If you're in his employ,

39:36.151 --> 39:40.554
it could make it easier for us
if you could act as our eyes and ears.

39:40.654 --> 39:42.864
Absolutely. No problem.

39:43.739 --> 39:45.991
My first loyalty
would always be to the firm.

39:46.282 --> 39:48.951
- Hmm.
- Hmm. Keep us posted.

39:51.370 --> 39:55.499
Oh, and don't mention this conversation
to Miss Drake or anyone else.

39:55.749 --> 39:57.542
Oh, of course not. No.

39:58.668 --> 40:00.169
And thank you.

40:00.627 --> 40:02.128
Thank you both very much.

40:04.380 --> 40:05.864
- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Mr. Brewster.

40:05.964 --> 40:08.841
- Here's the money. You think I'm crazy?
- Crazy?

40:09.091 --> 40:11.551
- Of course not.
- Let's go do business.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.921
- Hi, Monty. Big day ahead, pal.
- Okay. Great.

40:25.021 --> 40:27.172
Let's do some business,
and kick some butt around here!

40:27.272 --> 40:29.590
- All right. Let's kick some butt around here!
- What?

40:29.690 --> 40:32.091
- What? Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

40:32.191 --> 40:35.010
Who the hell am I? I'm Morty King,
king of the mimics, that's who!

40:35.110 --> 40:37.345
Anything you say
I guarantee it'll be repeated.

40:37.445 --> 40:39.071
I'm like an X-Erox machine.

40:39.529 --> 40:42.573
- No, Warren. Hold it more to the left.
- Your left or my left?

40:42.781 --> 40:45.784
Oh, look, there's Warren.
That must be Marilyn. Hey!

40:45.992 --> 40:47.726
- You just watch your mouth.
- You just watch your mouth.

40:47.826 --> 40:50.520
Don't you remember
anything I ever taught you?

40:50.620 --> 40:52.605
It's my left. It's always my left.

40:52.705 --> 40:54.039
It's the decorator's left.

40:54.664 --> 40:56.040
- Hey.
- Watch out!

40:58.292 --> 41:00.694
Oh, Warren! Oh, are you okay?

41:00.794 --> 41:03.237
- Oh. Ah.
- Oh, God. Be careful.

41:03.337 --> 41:05.839
- Hi. I'm Monty Brewster.
- Monty Brewster?

41:06.256 --> 41:08.616
How do you do?
I've heard so much about you.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.367
Please, may I call you Monty?

41:10.467 --> 41:12.076
- Of course.
- Of course.

41:12.176 --> 41:14.035
Oh, Monty, I have the
most wonderful idea for you.

41:14.135 --> 41:17.412
I am going to do for you
a postmodern fantasy in here.

41:17.512 --> 41:19.955
- Oh, I knew this was a terrible idea.
- What are you saying?

41:20.055 --> 41:21.723
You don't like the postmodern
fantasy look?

41:22.140 --> 41:25.292
- Shut your eyes, and see Mesopotamia...
- Mesopotamia.

41:25.392 --> 41:27.960
- Meeting Busby Berkeley.
- Yes, that sounds...

41:28.060 --> 41:29.728
- Yes. It's a knockout.
- It's a knockout.

41:29.936 --> 41:31.020
We're gonna knock out the walls too.

41:31.395 --> 41:33.254
- Every one. Everywhere.
- Every one. Everywhere.

41:33.354 --> 41:34.629
- Spare no expense.
- Spare no expense.

41:34.729 --> 41:36.588
Will you shut up?

41:36.688 --> 41:38.714
It's only for a month, darling.

41:38.814 --> 41:41.399
And it's going to be a very long month.

41:41.690 --> 41:44.258
- Get... Get four sets.
- Get... Get four sets.

41:44.358 --> 41:46.009
Wonderful. Fine. Fine.

41:46.109 --> 41:50.054
Oh, Angela. Angela.
Please, I need to speak to you. Please.

41:50.154 --> 41:52.472
Angela, did Warren tell you
that I have decided,

41:52.572 --> 41:56.266
as my wedding gift to you two, I am going
to decorate your apartment for free.

41:56.366 --> 41:57.367
That's great, Marilyn.

41:57.742 --> 41:59.618
- Thank you.
- Pas de quoi.

42:01.286 --> 42:04.079
Mr. Brewster, I'm a real good manicurist.

42:05.872 --> 42:07.481
Spike, You know what I'd like you to do?

42:07.581 --> 42:08.648
- What's that?
- Choke this guy.

42:08.748 --> 42:09.773
My pleasure.

42:09.873 --> 42:12.108
Come on, asshole!

42:12.208 --> 42:13.442
I'll give you a line on anything.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.109
Baseball, basketball,
football, the ponies.

42:15.209 --> 42:16.526
Whatever you want!

42:16.626 --> 42:17.776
Come on with me.

42:17.876 --> 42:20.093
I gotta stop here at my desk
and get my messages.

42:20.668 --> 42:22.277
Excuse me. Pardon me. Please, sir.

42:22.377 --> 42:24.320
I'd like to call
your attention to this area right here.

42:24.420 --> 42:26.488
This is the Arabian desert.
It is a dry as a bone.

42:26.588 --> 42:29.823
It's a place where a glass of ice water
can cost $5.00 a glass, sir.

42:29.923 --> 42:31.949
Now, up here. This is the North Pole.
It's an ice floe,

42:32.049 --> 42:35.493
and throughout this region
of the North Atlantic are many icebergs, sir.

42:35.593 --> 42:39.162
And nobody owns them. They're PDIs.
Public Domain Icebergs.

42:39.262 --> 42:42.289
I think you're beginning to recognize
how simple and pure this idea is.

42:42.389 --> 42:46.267
Now, what I would like to do is go the North
Pole, select a good-sized iceberg,

42:46.409 --> 42:48.602
and simply dig out a chamber
from the rear end of it,

42:48.702 --> 42:51.604
drop in two 20,000-horsepower
marine diesel engines,

42:51.704 --> 42:55.773
and sail Brewstersberg
number one to Mecca.

42:55.873 --> 42:56.857
What do you think, sir?

42:58.041 --> 43:00.251
- I don't know what to think.
- Mr. Brewster, line three.

43:01.502 --> 43:03.445
- Hello. Yes. What?
- Mr. Brewster, it went up!

43:03.545 --> 43:05.046
It went up? Well, sell it.

43:05.379 --> 43:07.506
Don't sell it!
You buy it when it's like that.

43:08.298 --> 43:09.323
It's a great idea. What's your name?

43:09.423 --> 43:10.407
- Luther.
- Luther, listen.

43:10.507 --> 43:12.950
I'd like to bet on
every long shot in every race,

43:13.050 --> 43:14.784
50-to-1 and over this week at Aqueduct.

43:14.884 --> 43:16.743
For the week? Yeah, I can cover it.

43:16.843 --> 43:18.702
- Great. How much to get this off the ground?
- Oh, maybe...

43:18.802 --> 43:21.871
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This thing melts, and he knows it!

43:21.971 --> 43:25.707
We would experience a loss of only 18%
through evaporation and melting.

43:25.807 --> 43:29.251
Hey. Think of what that means to all
those thirsty Arab farmers! It's great!

43:29.351 --> 43:30.459
What thirsty Arab farmers?

43:30.559 --> 43:32.377
There aren't any! There just aren't any!

43:32.477 --> 43:34.437
'Cause there's no farmers
in the desert, Monty!

43:34.937 --> 43:36.605
Well, I think that's unfair!

43:37.105 --> 43:40.716
Loyola vs. Notre Dame
in a field hockey game? This is fabulous.

43:40.816 --> 43:41.883
You went to Loyola, didn't you?

43:41.983 --> 43:43.008
You gotta be kidding!

43:43.108 --> 43:46.111
Listen, I want to bet $50,000
that Loyola wins!

43:46.319 --> 43:48.637
$50,000 on Loyola over Notre Dame

43:48.737 --> 43:50.846
and $5,000 on every
50-to-1 long shot for the week.

43:50.946 --> 43:52.822
- Sir, you are down!
- He's doin' it!

43:53.072 --> 43:55.223
It's field hockey.

43:55.323 --> 43:58.849
If I gave you a million dollars for this
iceberg thing, would that be enough?

43:58.949 --> 44:01.750
A million dollars. Yes.
That would be great, sir.

44:01.850 --> 44:02.934
- Hello.
- Brewster.

44:03.034 --> 44:04.727
Charley! How you doin', my man?

44:04.827 --> 44:06.770
- All right.
- That's great. I just bought an iceberg.

44:06.870 --> 44:08.229
- What?
- Wait till you see the uniforms I rented.

44:08.329 --> 44:09.896
Not yet, he hasn't. Not yet.

44:09.996 --> 44:12.022
- And I rented our home stadium.
- What?

44:12.122 --> 44:14.440
Yes, and I'm gonna spare
no expense and fix it up

44:14.540 --> 44:16.649
and make it look
like a big league stadium!

44:16.749 --> 44:19.568
It's gonna be great because
we're gonna play an exhibition game.

44:19.668 --> 44:20.777
With the Yankees, three innings!

44:20.877 --> 44:21.860
The Yankees?

44:21.960 --> 44:22.944
And I'm pitching!

44:23.044 --> 44:24.111
- New York Yankees!
- What the hell's goin' on?

44:24.211 --> 44:26.671
- I gotta get these guys on the bus!
- Charley, don't take the bus.

44:38.765 --> 44:41.375
Chuck Fleming, Action News.
I'm here at Battery Park

44:41.475 --> 44:43.501
with Montgomery Brewster and entourage

44:43.601 --> 44:46.545
anxiously awaiting the arrival
of the Hackensack Bulls,

44:46.645 --> 44:48.630
in New York City
for the first time to tune up

44:48.730 --> 44:52.691
for an unprecedented challenge game
with the famed New York Yankees.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.442
Naturally, Monty Brewster
intends to pitch.

45:24.173 --> 45:27.450
Christ sakes, Brewster.
You fly us all the way from Jersey,

45:27.550 --> 45:29.826
and then you get these
choppers to fly us back here!

45:29.926 --> 45:32.035
We took the bus,
we would've been here two hours ago!

45:32.135 --> 45:35.179
Tell my team,
from now on we travel first class!

45:36.930 --> 45:39.474
Hey, Charley, welcome to New York City!

45:41.808 --> 45:42.750
You guys look great!

45:42.850 --> 45:44.959
How do you like the new uniforms?

45:45.810 --> 45:48.479
You gotta wait till you see the
apartments I rented for you guys.

45:48.979 --> 45:51.940
- He rented apartments for these guys?
- Apartments?

45:52.315 --> 45:54.466
Penthouses with swimming pools.

45:54.566 --> 45:57.009
Twenty-seven players,
everybody's got their own place.

45:57.109 --> 45:58.718
We're gonna have a lot of fun, men,

45:58.818 --> 46:01.386
because we're gonna get in shape, and
we're gonna beat the Yankees!

46:01.486 --> 46:03.154
All right!

46:03.654 --> 46:06.055
If you ask me,
they oughta lock him up for his own good.

46:06.155 --> 46:07.556
And what the hell
does he think he's doin'?

46:07.656 --> 46:10.016
The Yankees see this,
they're really gonna rub it in.

46:10.116 --> 46:11.892
Come on, Charley, relax!

46:11.992 --> 46:13.726
Enjoy yourself!

46:16.661 --> 46:18.579
Huh? Is that great?

46:22.833 --> 46:26.194
- I hope we haven't underestimated him.
- I beg your pardon?

46:26.294 --> 46:27.945
Oh, you're doing fine, Warren.

46:28.045 --> 46:31.114
This is precisely the kind of
flagrant misuse of money

46:31.214 --> 46:32.823
that we want you to keep us apprised of.

46:32.923 --> 46:34.866
- Oh, he's wasting millions of dollars.
- Mmm.

46:34.966 --> 46:38.177
You should see what he spent
on the decorations alone.

46:38.552 --> 46:40.912
Wait till you see the practice field.

46:41.012 --> 46:44.015
It's great. I'm gonna
have the bus take us over to the island.

46:44.306 --> 46:46.207
The practice field's on Long Island?

46:46.307 --> 46:49.543
- Yeah.
- Brewster, the airport's on Long Island.

46:49.643 --> 46:52.003
You flew us all the way in
from the airport to here

46:52.103 --> 46:54.254
so we could take the bus
back to Long Island?

46:54.354 --> 46:57.173
I couldn't get the band on the runway.
They wouldn't let me!

46:57.273 --> 46:59.508
No matter how much money I offered them.

46:59.608 --> 47:02.218
Oh, yeah.
You can't play baseball without a band.

47:02.318 --> 47:04.570
Right. Come on. Let's get on the bus.

47:04.695 --> 47:07.072
One-two, one-two, one-two.

47:07.238 --> 47:09.030
Come on! Come on! Move it! Move it!

47:13.592 --> 47:16.761
Beautiful, Benny!
Tinkers to Evers to shit!

47:17.094 --> 47:18.953
Pick it up! The white ball. That's it!

47:19.053 --> 47:23.039
Hey! Come on! Jesus, I don't know
what's the matter with those guys.

47:23.139 --> 47:24.723
We play better than this. Honest we do.

47:25.265 --> 47:28.017
- Maybe they're tight right now.
- Maybe they're tired.

47:28.434 --> 47:31.562
Maybe it was that long flight
you chartered from Newark.

47:32.563 --> 47:35.006
I'm gonna go warm up, Miss Drake.

47:35.106 --> 47:37.382
Why don't you try the same?

47:37.482 --> 47:40.384
Hey, come on! Look good out there!

47:40.484 --> 47:42.944
Let's do a 6-4-3. Pepper it up!

47:46.405 --> 47:49.698
Hey, Collins, you got trouble with your
glove, try catching it with your ass!

48:08.007 --> 48:10.509
Hi, operator?
Mr. Brewster's suite, please.

48:14.887 --> 48:16.388
Aw, God...

48:17.806 --> 48:18.932
Time.

48:24.896 --> 48:27.089
- What?
- Hi, Brewster. This is Angela.

48:27.189 --> 48:29.191
- Angela who?
- Angela Drake.

48:30.150 --> 48:32.426
- Miss Drake.
- Um, I was wondering.

48:32.526 --> 48:34.635
Could I come up there
and talk to you for a minute?

48:34.735 --> 48:36.511
- Talk to me? Now?
- Mmm-hmm.

48:36.611 --> 48:38.762
- Uh, perhaps in the morning.
- Oh, no. Monty?

48:38.862 --> 48:40.780
This is very important,
and I need to see you now.

48:47.703 --> 48:50.605
- Can't you tell me over the phone?
- No, because, look.

48:50.705 --> 48:54.983
This is something that could do both of us
a world of good, if you know what I mean.

48:55.083 --> 48:57.710
- Have you been drinking?
- No, not at all.

48:59.336 --> 49:02.589
- And you want to come up to my room, now?
- Mmm-hmm.

49:08.553 --> 49:10.346
- Miss Drake?
- Uh-huh?

49:12.222 --> 49:13.873
- Angela.
- Yes.

49:13.973 --> 49:15.975
- Give me five minutes.
- Okay.

49:20.312 --> 49:23.798
That was Miss Drake. She says
there's a mad bomber in the building.

49:23.898 --> 49:25.357
They're getting
all the people out of the hotel.

49:26.191 --> 49:30.386
Listen, get your wrap. You go away,
and you could come back tomorrow.

49:30.486 --> 49:31.737
We can start all over.

49:31.903 --> 49:33.345
Well, did he fall for it?

49:33.445 --> 49:35.846
- Yes, he fell for it.
- What do you look so unhappy for?

49:35.946 --> 49:38.038
We're doing it for his own good.

49:38.488 --> 49:39.739
Come on!

49:40.239 --> 49:41.406
Adieu.

49:42.407 --> 49:44.767
Been expecting you. The door's open.

49:44.867 --> 49:47.143
Come in, the door's open.

49:48.143 --> 49:50.354
Angela, hello.

49:50.454 --> 49:52.372
Hello, Angela. Just be cool.

49:55.666 --> 49:57.108
- Hi, Spike.
- Hi.

49:57.208 --> 49:59.960
She's really a very nice girl.
You should get to know...

50:00.418 --> 50:01.836
- Hi.
- Hi, Spike.

50:04.255 --> 50:06.423
The door's open. Come in.

50:10.993 --> 50:13.203
Hi, Eugene Provost, financial advisor.

50:13.303 --> 50:15.121
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Who in hell is this?

50:15.221 --> 50:17.663
- He's a big league money man.
- Money?

50:17.763 --> 50:21.750
Look, for the past five years,
this guy's predicted 88%.

50:21.850 --> 50:24.210
88% of what this guy says makes money!

50:24.310 --> 50:27.129
88.4% to be exact, but who's counting?

50:27.229 --> 50:29.589
I'm so confident of my ability
to make you money,

50:29.689 --> 50:33.258
I will only take 15%
of your profits after taxes.

50:33.358 --> 50:36.402
In other words, I only get paid
if you profit from my advice.

50:37.152 --> 50:41.514
Then you're hired.
$100,000 a week plus 15%.

50:41.614 --> 50:44.308
Monty, the man doesn't want the $100,000.

50:44.408 --> 50:46.392
Well, the man's gonna
have to take $100,000,

50:46.492 --> 50:50.604
because that's what the job pays.
$100,000 a week, plus 15%.

50:50.704 --> 50:52.313
What do you say?

50:52.413 --> 50:54.356
I'll make an exception
in your case, Mr. Brewster.

50:54.456 --> 50:56.124
- Good!
- Sure. Join the club.

50:57.625 --> 51:01.503
Hey, 9:15.
It's way past your bedtime, Miss Drake.

51:02.086 --> 51:04.529
You'll never know, Mr. Brewster.

51:04.629 --> 51:07.780
Be sure to get home before the sun comes up.
You know what I mean?

51:10.090 --> 51:11.966
Good night, gentlemen.

51:15.094 --> 51:18.305
Come on. Settle down, will ya?
You'll throw your arm out.

51:18.972 --> 51:23.141
God damn it. She's gonna be real mad
when she finds out what's goin' on.

51:27.895 --> 51:29.796
Will you forget about Angela?

51:29.896 --> 51:31.713
She's a bad investment.

51:31.813 --> 51:33.731
Now, Eugene has helped
me out with my investments.

51:33.981 --> 51:37.509
You know, precious metals, rare coins,

51:37.609 --> 51:39.885
some old stamps, stuff like that.

51:39.985 --> 51:42.654
- He says it's a ledge against inflation.
- Stamps.

51:59.628 --> 52:02.714
Thank you. I'm just in time.
Do you sell stamps?

52:03.464 --> 52:06.950
I think that you want
the stationery store across the street.

52:07.050 --> 52:09.660
The stamps we have here
are very rare, very expensive.

52:09.760 --> 52:10.761
How expensive?

52:11.803 --> 52:15.206
- Well, let me show you, Mr., uh...
- Montgomery Brewster.

52:15.306 --> 52:20.002
Montgomery Brewster! I have been
reading about you in the newspaper.

52:20.102 --> 52:22.420
I'd like to see your most expensive stamp.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.146
Ah! One moment.

52:27.190 --> 52:30.717
This may be the first intelligent thing
he's done with his money since he got it.

52:30.817 --> 52:33.010
Maybe he's comin' to his senses, you know?

52:33.110 --> 52:35.470
- What do you think?
- Hey, I'm gettin' paid to take pictures.

52:35.570 --> 52:37.196
My job is not to interpret reality.

52:38.530 --> 52:41.865
- You're a real jerk, you know that?
- Ain't that the truth.

52:42.065 --> 52:43.575
Hey, tell it to my accountant.

52:43.908 --> 52:48.579
As you can see, the airplane was
accidentally printed upside-down.

52:49.037 --> 52:51.789
Of the 100 of these stamps
originally printed,

52:51.973 --> 52:55.416
this is the only known copy in existence.

52:55.558 --> 53:00.104
Baron Levitsky recently offered $850,000
for it, and I laughed in his face.

53:07.694 --> 53:10.780
I'd say the stamp he bought
is a considerable asset.

53:11.238 --> 53:14.824
He doesn't even understand the rules yet.
Let's see him get out of this one.

53:18.284 --> 53:20.101
- Good morning, Mr. Granville.
- Good morning.

53:20.201 --> 53:21.185
Here's the mail.

53:21.285 --> 53:22.227
Thank you.

53:22.327 --> 53:24.561
- Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?
- Hold on for a minute.

53:24.661 --> 53:27.163
I may want to send you to the files.

53:27.329 --> 53:28.313
Norris.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.414
Hmm?

53:29.872 --> 53:32.165
Hackensack Bulls.

53:33.291 --> 53:35.401
"Having a wonderful time.
Wish you were here.

53:35.501 --> 53:38.295
"Best wishes, Monty Brewster."

53:44.884 --> 53:48.679
God! It isn't an asset anymore.
He's mailed it!

53:50.138 --> 53:51.121
Get Cox over here.

53:51.221 --> 53:52.222
Right away, sir.

53:52.847 --> 53:54.223
The son of a bitch.

53:54.973 --> 53:58.334
So, in strictest confidence,
you can see how vital it is to the firm

53:58.434 --> 54:01.461
that Brewster does not succeed
in spending that $30 million, Warren.

54:01.561 --> 54:03.754
He's made a fool of you
and of your ex-wife.

54:03.854 --> 54:05.922
We think he has designs
on your fiance as well.

54:06.022 --> 54:09.967
A small error in bookkeeping discovered at
the last moment ought to do the trick.

54:10.067 --> 54:12.927
Say, a $20,000 mistake
in Brewster's favor.

54:13.027 --> 54:14.260
It'll be our little insurance policy.

54:14.360 --> 54:19.431
And the $300 million will go to the firm.
Granville, Baxter and Cox.

54:19.531 --> 54:21.241
Welcome aboard, Warren.

54:21.699 --> 54:25.268
The big story on Wall Street today
is that Icebergs International

54:25.368 --> 54:27.353
has been bought out by Wometco Petroleum

54:27.453 --> 54:30.772
in order to secure
tax benefits within the Common Market.

54:30.872 --> 54:32.981
The buy-out will enable
the parent company to free up...

54:33.081 --> 54:36.192
Is he a genius, or is he a genius?

54:36.292 --> 54:37.776
Can't understand it, Mr. Brewster?

54:37.876 --> 54:42.654
The stock, which was valued at 1.5,
now has a par value of over $9.00 a share.

54:42.754 --> 54:43.779
In other news...

54:43.879 --> 54:46.155
I want to sell my stock in the iceberg!

54:46.255 --> 54:47.781
- Sell? Oh, no.
- Yeah!

54:47.881 --> 54:49.615
That doesn't seem like a smart thing...

54:49.715 --> 54:51.616
- Uh, Mr. Brewster...
- What?

54:51.716 --> 54:53.242
You see, the parent company, Wometco,

54:53.342 --> 54:56.536
is one of the strongest organizations
in the world petroleum market.

54:56.636 --> 54:59.788
And they've been consistently good
performers in profits and dividends.

54:59.888 --> 55:02.206
You don't want to sell, Mr. Brewster.
You've got a lot of obligations.

55:02.306 --> 55:05.292
You got a huge payroll to meet,
you got overhead, retirement plans.

55:05.392 --> 55:06.959
You don't want to lay anyone off, do ya?

55:07.059 --> 55:08.435
No, I don't want to lay anyone off.

55:13.773 --> 55:16.633
Count it. It's all there.
Nothing but long shots, huh?

55:16.733 --> 55:19.710
Well, you just won yourself
a cool million-five, wise guy.

55:21.069 --> 55:24.638
The word is out on you.
I had to lay these bets off all over town.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.014
You don't make another bet
in this city again, ever!

55:27.114 --> 55:29.891
- I just...
- Loyola 18, Notre Dame, zilch.

55:29.991 --> 55:31.141
Thanks a lot, baby.

55:32.408 --> 55:35.768
This is unreported income, gained
from an illegal venture, Mr. Brewster.

55:35.868 --> 55:38.912
I would recommend you immediately
dispatch a courier to Switzerland

55:39.287 --> 55:41.414
and deposit this money
in a secret numbered account.

55:41.664 --> 55:43.774
I don't want it!
I'm gonna give it to charity!

55:43.874 --> 55:46.067
- What's your favorite charity?
- Oh, I don't know.

55:46.167 --> 55:49.879
- There are so many worthwhile charities.
- So many worthwhile charities!

55:50.087 --> 55:53.656
Good. Divide it up amongst the many
charities, and give it to them.

55:53.756 --> 55:56.283
And everybody go back to work,
because this is a business.

55:56.383 --> 55:58.868
And we're in the business of being in
business, and we're doin' business.

55:58.968 --> 56:01.261
And nobody's business. Do it.
Business. Good.

56:01.803 --> 56:04.263
I want business done.
That's the way it should be.

56:04.638 --> 56:06.514
When you do business...

56:07.139 --> 56:09.833
That was so wonderful,
what you just did in there.

56:09.933 --> 56:12.460
Look, I know you think
I'm always complaining, but it's not that.

56:12.560 --> 56:15.670
It's just that I can't stand seeing these
people take advantage of you anymore.

56:15.770 --> 56:18.672
Miss Drake, I'm very sorry.
And I appreciate what you're trying to do.

56:18.772 --> 56:21.507
- But you don't know what I'm trying to do.
- What are you trying to do?

56:21.607 --> 56:24.443
- What I'm trying to do...
- Oh, Monty?

56:25.986 --> 56:28.471
Could you step in here
for a moment, please?

56:28.571 --> 56:30.597
- Of course, Marilyn.
- Good afternoon, Angela.

56:30.697 --> 56:33.282
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Well, Monty...

56:34.157 --> 56:36.684
What do you think
of our postmodern fantasy?

56:36.784 --> 56:38.226
Well, darling,

56:38.326 --> 56:40.144
Marilyn's really outdone
herself this time, don't you think?

56:40.244 --> 56:42.354
- Oh, Warren.
- It's good!

56:42.454 --> 56:45.123
It is very good, Marilyn.
But it's not great.

56:45.540 --> 56:48.358
You see, Marilyn, I want you to reach deep
down inside yourself this time,

56:48.458 --> 56:51.002
and come up with something
specifically unique.

56:51.460 --> 56:53.778
I want to walk in this room
and say to myself,

56:53.878 --> 56:56.672
"Monty, I want to die in this room."

56:57.464 --> 57:00.116
I want to die in this room, Marilyn.

57:00.216 --> 57:01.783
And double the workmen's salary.

57:01.883 --> 57:03.826
I mean, they look exhausted.

57:03.926 --> 57:06.553
Help out! Come on! It's a business!

57:08.179 --> 57:11.540
Angela, I'm not going to be
able to make dinner, darling.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.725
There's just too much
to be done around here.

57:14.142 --> 57:16.144
Whatever you say, Warren.

57:17.311 --> 57:19.354
A room you want to die in.

57:20.438 --> 57:22.422
- What? What?
- What were you trying to tell me before?

57:22.522 --> 57:24.548
Miss Drake, I don't know how
to explain this to you, but...

57:24.648 --> 57:27.342
Even though I'm not
the person that you thought I was,

57:27.442 --> 57:30.052
I'm not the person that
you think I am now, either.

57:30.152 --> 57:33.029
Yes, but I don't understand why when you
make money you get so miserable,

57:33.213 --> 57:34.864
then when you lose it, you act so happy.

57:34.964 --> 57:36.990
Uh, that's because I can't
get used to being rich.

57:37.090 --> 57:39.784
But you could do great things with all
that money. You mustn't squander it.

57:39.884 --> 57:41.927
Squander it? What are you talking about?
I'm making millions.

57:42.218 --> 57:43.785
We didn't get off to a very good start.

57:43.885 --> 57:46.829
And I thought we'd take a little
ride and get to know each other.

57:46.929 --> 57:49.080
You'll find out I'm not
such a bad guy, after all.

57:49.180 --> 57:50.831
Miss Drake, your chariot awaits!

57:50.931 --> 57:53.082
Oh, no, Mr. Brewster. I can't accept this.

57:53.182 --> 57:55.333
This is a $125,000 car.

57:55.433 --> 57:57.935
Eugene said I needed a tax write-off.

57:58.226 --> 58:00.836
Can't we just take a ride
without having an argument?

58:00.936 --> 58:05.231
I promise not to spend any money,
except on you for lunch.

58:05.940 --> 58:08.525
All right, but just to eat lunch,
and then that's it.

58:19.786 --> 58:22.438
- So where shall we go?
- You're driving.

58:22.538 --> 58:25.207
Oh, I know this nice little
restaurant near the place I grew up.

58:26.082 --> 58:27.875
Now, it's not fancy, but...

58:28.542 --> 58:31.819
- What the... Are you all right?
- I think so.

58:31.919 --> 58:33.503
- You sure?
- Yeah.

58:39.342 --> 58:40.659
I'm terribly sorry.

58:40.759 --> 58:43.077
The parking attendant left
my car in first.

58:43.177 --> 58:45.287
And when I turned on
the ignition, it shot forward.

58:45.387 --> 58:46.412
Are you all right?

58:46.512 --> 58:48.096
- Yes.
- Fine, fine, but you look hurt.

58:48.346 --> 58:49.621
Honestly, I'm fine.

58:49.721 --> 58:51.931
Look, look, here's my driver's license.

58:52.306 --> 58:55.041
Great! Great! Don't be ridiculous.
Put that away.

58:55.141 --> 58:58.127
You're in a state of shock.
Emotional trauma.

58:58.227 --> 58:59.211
What are you talking about?

58:59.311 --> 59:00.336
Brain damage.

59:00.436 --> 59:02.129
He's got brain damage
and doesn't even know it.

59:02.229 --> 59:04.522
Hey, George! Get an ambulance!

59:05.064 --> 59:07.232
Are you all right, Mr. Brewster?

59:07.440 --> 59:09.883
Brewster? Montgomery Brewster?

59:09.983 --> 59:11.734
Yes, that's me. See?

59:12.901 --> 59:16.095
I really don't feel very good.
I'm starting to lose feeling in my legs.

59:16.195 --> 59:18.680
Oh, stop it!
Can't you see this man is faking?

59:18.780 --> 59:20.222
Faking?
I can't have this on my conscience.

59:20.322 --> 59:22.724
This man's going to be paralyzed for life.

59:22.824 --> 59:25.142
Dear sir, do you think
you could settle this out of court

59:25.242 --> 59:27.560
for a couple of hundred thousand dollars?

59:27.660 --> 59:29.119
Two ex-wives.

59:29.452 --> 59:30.911
Two ex-wives?

59:31.494 --> 59:33.287
300,000?

59:33.495 --> 59:34.729
You go to the doctor's right away, okay?

59:34.829 --> 59:35.813
Uh-huh.

59:35.913 --> 59:40.167
And you're giving him this
for a prescription, and you'll be all right.

59:40.834 --> 59:41.818
Thank you.

59:41.918 --> 59:42.919
Have a good day!

59:44.420 --> 59:46.488
Get a cold compress
for that thing on your head,

59:46.588 --> 59:48.339
and a large bottle of Aspirin!

59:48.839 --> 59:50.090
Nice man.

59:51.174 --> 59:53.117
See, the check will be a receipt.

59:53.217 --> 59:55.577
Well, I'm starving.
I'm ready to go to lunch now.

59:55.677 --> 59:56.744
I wanna meet your family.

59:56.844 --> 59:57.911
- Meet my family?
- Yeah.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.203
What do you wanna do? Buy 'em?

59:59.303 --> 01:00:02.389
I would be ashamed to introduce
my family to somebody like you!

01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:04.665
Angela! Wait. Listen to me.

01:00:04.765 --> 01:00:07.000
Angela! Will you wait a minute?

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.293
I did the best I could.
That wasn't that man's fault.

01:00:09.393 --> 01:00:10.418
Yes, I know it wasn't.

01:00:10.518 --> 01:00:12.002
But the first time
you get some money, what do you do?

01:00:12.102 --> 01:00:15.271
You spend it and show off.
You just gave away $300,000!

01:00:15.604 --> 01:00:16.980
Oh, my God.

01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:20.131
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

01:00:20.231 --> 01:00:21.315
Oh, is that awful.

01:00:21.732 --> 01:00:24.359
I don't believe it. Oh, how tasteless.

01:00:25.318 --> 01:00:27.886
Boy, that girl is ungrateful,
considering all the things

01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:30.405
you've done to try to improve her.

01:00:31.072 --> 01:00:33.866
I just think this is unforgivable.

01:00:36.785 --> 01:00:37.827
Thank you.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:44.356
I realize you're not very interested
in what Marilyn and I are doing,

01:00:44.456 --> 01:00:47.817
but we have a real shot
at getting our work into AD next month.

01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:49.442
AD?

01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:51.210
Architectural Digest.

01:00:52.294 --> 01:00:54.445
That's really wonderful.
I'm very happy for you and Marilyn.

01:00:54.545 --> 01:00:55.529
Are you all right?

01:00:55.629 --> 01:00:58.615
Look, Warren, I'm not very happy
with this whole situation.

01:00:58.715 --> 01:01:00.574
You could have fooled me.

01:01:00.674 --> 01:01:01.949
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:05.552
It means that you and Monty seem to
be getting along awfully well.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.995
And give everybody else in
here whatever they're drinking.

01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:10.205
It doesn't matter.
Champagne, anything, as long as I'm here.

01:01:10.305 --> 01:01:11.472
Yes, sir, Mr. Brewster.

01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:14.756
Drinks on the house!
Courtesy of Mr. Brewster.

01:01:15.306 --> 01:01:18.041
Well, Monty Brewster's extravagance
knows no bounds.

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:21.168
After paying the highest-recorded
price ever for a stamp,

01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:24.337
Brewster today shelled out
a record $600,000

01:01:24.437 --> 01:01:27.606
for five cases of 114-year-old
French wine.

01:01:27.897 --> 01:01:29.923
He stunned the crowd here
at Weatherby's auction house

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:32.258
by not only paying in cash for the wine,

01:01:32.358 --> 01:01:36.301
but by opening all 60 bottles
at a reception for the public afterwards.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.968
At $10,000 a bottle,

01:01:38.068 --> 01:01:41.137
that is gotta be the most expensive hangover
this reporter's ever heard of.

01:01:41.237 --> 01:01:42.529
Chuck Fleming. Action News.

01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.494
- Angela?
- What?

01:01:50.244 --> 01:01:52.288
I asked if your feelings had changed.

01:01:52.388 --> 01:01:53.972
Look, how can I make it
any clearer for you?

01:01:54.263 --> 01:01:56.247
Can you please pay for the drinks
and let's get out of here?

01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:58.223
We don't have to pay for the drinks.
They're on Monty.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.351
- Brewster?
- Yes?

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.920
Looks like you've
got a busy evening ahead of you.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.546
Yeah, I'm too busy to have fun.

01:02:07.646 --> 01:02:09.213
I got to spend money, right?

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:12.048
I must say, mailing that
stamp was quite ingenious.

01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:14.091
You liked that?
How about the wine auction?

01:02:14.191 --> 01:02:15.800
Again, very imaginative.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.861
I understand it cost $600,000,
according to Miss Drake.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.932
There she goes again, as usual.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:27.643
I am sick and tired of acting
like a rich asshole for everybody.

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:28.727
I'm fed up.

01:02:28.827 --> 01:02:31.312
Maybe I should've took
Uncle Rupert's wimp clause.

01:02:31.412 --> 01:02:33.271
I don't think I'm gonna
pull this off, do you?

01:02:33.371 --> 01:02:34.688
I don't know, Mr. Brewster.

01:02:34.788 --> 01:02:38.207
But that baseball game you're planning
sounds like a step in the right direction.

01:02:43.003 --> 01:02:46.756
My left leg. See? I planted it down wrong.
I was off-balance.

01:02:49.216 --> 01:02:52.493
Ooh! Go ahead, Monty.
Now that's the Monty I know.

01:02:52.593 --> 01:02:53.618
- That's it.
- Hi, Monty.

01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:55.610
How's it going, buddy?

01:02:56.677 --> 01:02:57.619
Tell him the good news, Eugene.

01:02:57.719 --> 01:02:58.953
No, you tell him. It was your idea.

01:02:59.053 --> 01:03:00.746
All right, I got some good
news and some bad news for you.

01:03:00.846 --> 01:03:02.663
- Well, tell him the bad news first.
- All right, all right.

01:03:02.763 --> 01:03:04.789
Here's the bad news.
I did exactly what you wanted me to do.

01:03:04.889 --> 01:03:06.790
I got rid of all your iceberg stocks.

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:08.833
- That's great.
- That's the bad news.

01:03:08.933 --> 01:03:10.042
- You ready for the good news?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.142 --> 01:03:11.876
Okay, here it comes.
I took Eugene's advice, all right?

01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:14.962
Admittedly, without you knowing, I used the
corporate name. I hope you don't mind.

01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:17.255
- No, no.
- I made some investments for you.

01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:18.630
- That's okay.
- What did I buy?

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.131
I bought a commodity thing
and I bought an oil well thing.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.798
He just made you $10 million.

01:03:22.898 --> 01:03:24.923
$10 million!

01:03:25.774 --> 01:03:27.550
Isn't that wonderful?

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.902
$10 million, $10 million, $10 million!

01:03:32.738 --> 01:03:34.681
No! Damn it!

01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:37.575
I'm right back where I started, damn it!

01:03:42.413 --> 01:03:43.580
Jesus.

01:03:45.748 --> 01:03:49.835
$10 million. $10 million.

01:03:52.587 --> 01:03:54.947
What's the matter, Monty? I mean...

01:03:55.047 --> 01:03:58.232
I make the guy $10 million
and he acts like it's a funeral.

01:03:58.924 --> 01:04:01.134
It's American money, you know.

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:03.010
Congratulations.

01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:05.995
About that furniture
you wanted Marilyn and me to rent,

01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:10.890
I'm afraid the company's requiring
a substantial cash deposit. $20,000.

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:18.313
$20,000. Hey, don't forget.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.090
To give Angela the receipt? I know.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.008
Have to keep those books straight,
don't we, darling?

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:24.192
Yeah.

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:26.610
So long.

01:04:35.869 --> 01:04:38.496
I'd like to be alone. By myself.

01:04:38.954 --> 01:04:40.271
Sure. There's no problem there, Monty.

01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:42.355
You know, you're probably
getting psyched up for the Yankee game.

01:04:42.455 --> 01:04:43.605
That's what he always does this, you know.

01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:45.022
He gets a little cranky like this.

01:04:45.122 --> 01:04:47.065
It's only 'cause he's getting
psyched up for a big game.

01:04:47.165 --> 01:04:49.709
You know, sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't.

01:04:50.126 --> 01:04:52.378
This time we'll just leave him alone.

01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:54.362
I don't get it.

01:04:54.462 --> 01:04:55.779
Yeah, what the hell is with him?

01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:58.739
I think we should consider
the possibility of psychiatric help.

01:04:58.839 --> 01:04:59.881
What are you? Nuts?

01:05:10.557 --> 01:05:11.641
Okay.

01:05:16.937 --> 01:05:19.380
With less than two weeks
remaining until the election,

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.508
this station is sorry to report
that it finds itself unable to endorse

01:05:23.608 --> 01:05:26.302
either of the candidates
for mayor of New York.

01:05:26.402 --> 01:05:31.180
Both Mr. Heller and Mr. Salvino have
been pumping scandalous amounts of money

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.556
into slick advertising campaigns

01:05:33.656 --> 01:05:36.475
that so far have demonstrated
little more than their ability

01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:40.186
to slander each other
and squander campaign contributions.

01:05:40.286 --> 01:05:41.728
In the view of this station,

01:05:41.828 --> 01:05:44.897
the only issue being raised
by the Heller-Salvino debate

01:05:44.997 --> 01:05:47.607
is whether the city
of New York is for sale,

01:05:47.707 --> 01:05:50.751
and just how much slush money
it will take to buy it.

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:59.116
Running for political office
is extremely expensive, unless you win.

01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:00.908
And it's unheard of
to do it with your own money.

01:06:01.008 --> 01:06:02.367
Yeah. What does he know about politics?

01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:03.450
That is not the point.

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.409
He's trying to do some good
with his money.

01:06:05.509 --> 01:06:07.202
Look, I've finally figured
this whole thing out.

01:06:07.302 --> 01:06:09.119
That's why he gets so upset
when he makes a profit.

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:10.929
'Cause it makes him feel guilty.

01:06:11.429 --> 01:06:13.848
He's trying to do the right thing
for once in his life.

01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:18.518
Mr. Brewster!

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:20.835
Mr. Brewster!

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.378
Mr. Brewster! Mr. Brewster!

01:06:23.478 --> 01:06:27.522
Could you please give us your reasons
for your sudden and unexpected candidacy?

01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:32.275
I figure voting for Salvino or Heller is
just as silly as them running for office.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.567
Which is just as silly
as me running for office.

01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:37.319
The only thing not silly
is the power of the people's vote.

01:06:37.419 --> 01:06:42.881
And I think the people should use it
to vote for none of the above.

01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:47.283
Mr. Brewster, are we to understand

01:06:47.383 --> 01:06:49.701
that you actually don't want
anyone to vote for you?

01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:53.553
What I'm saying is I think only
an idiot would vote for me.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:58.414
Mr. Brewster, have you taken positions
on any of the issues facing the city?

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.582
Sanitation, union corruption,
urban renewal...

01:07:00.682 --> 01:07:02.583
Let's get to the bottom line, right?

01:07:02.683 --> 01:07:04.542
I'm here to buy your votes.

01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:08.211
With only 10 days, Mr. Brewster,
with only 10 days left before the election,

01:07:08.311 --> 01:07:10.796
how do you expect to find
that kind of support for that position?

01:07:10.896 --> 01:07:12.630
I don't expect to get support.

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.607
In fact, I'm asking people
not to send money in to my candidacy.

01:07:15.773 --> 01:07:19.234
I think the people should keep their money.
They're gonna need it after this election.

01:07:49.387 --> 01:07:51.847
Monty Brewster. That's me, right?

01:07:52.305 --> 01:07:57.351
And tonight, I'm here to talk to
you about "None of the above".

01:07:58.018 --> 01:08:01.044
You know how it is around election time
and you decide not to vote

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:04.230
because the two candidates
are so repulsive.

01:08:05.105 --> 01:08:07.649
Repulsive's not the word.
We're all full of shit.

01:08:08.024 --> 01:08:11.318
I didn't think you were supposed to use
that kind of language on television.

01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:14.195
Maybe he's just trying
to get his point across.

01:08:14.361 --> 01:08:17.363
I never wear a suit and a tie. Never.

01:08:18.031 --> 01:08:21.100
I mean, these are just things
that politicians use

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.394
to trick you into thinking
that they're respectable.

01:08:24.493 --> 01:08:26.287
Well... To the politician, huh?

01:08:41.385 --> 01:08:43.536
He bought prime time on every station?

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:45.453
Worse than that, he's on network.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:49.915
He's running spots in all 52 states just
in case any New Yorkers are on vacation.

01:08:50.015 --> 01:08:53.059
Write in "None of the above"
on your ballot.

01:08:53.642 --> 01:08:56.435
Don't vote for any of us. We're assholes.

01:08:56.978 --> 01:08:59.604
We'll only make things worse.

01:09:00.147 --> 01:09:01.814
Let's drink to it.

01:09:39.684 --> 01:09:42.377
I wanna thank you for coming out today

01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:48.140
to see to it that neither my opponents
nor me win the election.

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.614
I wanna ask the question.

01:09:59.617 --> 01:10:00.850
Who's buying the booze?

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:02.559
You are!

01:10:02.659 --> 01:10:04.018
Who's buying the food?

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:05.494
You are!

01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.688
And who's tryin' to buy your vote?

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:10.147
You are!

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.773
And who you're gonna vote for?

01:10:11.873 --> 01:10:13.690
None of the above!

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:14.791
Say it again!

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:16.442
None of the above!

01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:18.276
Let me hear it one more time!

01:10:18.376 --> 01:10:20.127
None of the above!

01:10:22.129 --> 01:10:23.421
Brewster! Brewster!

01:10:56.745 --> 01:10:58.062
Well, you can call it outrageous.

01:10:58.162 --> 01:10:59.729
You can call it a breath of fresh air.

01:10:59.829 --> 01:11:02.706
But what you can
no longer call it is a joke campaign.

01:11:03.039 --> 01:11:05.816
The eccentric multimillionaire
Montgomery Brewster

01:11:05.916 --> 01:11:09.276
is electrifying crowds
and is starting to show up in the polls.

01:11:09.376 --> 01:11:10.776
All this reporter can say is

01:11:10.876 --> 01:11:13.003
I hate to see
what he could do if he was serious.

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:52.983
So, what do you wanna talk about?

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:54.316
What do I wanna talk about?

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:55.608
Your people called my people.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.817
Bullshit. Your people made the first move.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:12:00.443
What's the difference?
We both got the same problem.

01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:02.319
- Brewster.
- Yeah, no kiddin'.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.404
You heard what he said about us
in a speech yesterday.

01:12:04.504 --> 01:12:06.589
Here, I'll quote it for you.

01:12:07.881 --> 01:12:12.093
"Heller and Salvino are both just a couple
of overgrown wharf rats.

01:12:12.218 --> 01:12:16.538
"Why else would anybody spend $10 million
to get a $60,000-a-year job

01:12:16.638 --> 01:12:19.223
"unless he planned
to steal it back with interest?"

01:12:19.556 --> 01:12:22.058
You and I are gonna sue him
for every cent he's got.

01:12:22.391 --> 01:12:25.394
That's very good, Heller. Very good.

01:12:46.538 --> 01:12:49.232
I called 'em a couple
of overgrown wharf rats

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:52.816
and I had to pay 'em $4 million
for the emotional damage it did.

01:12:52.916 --> 01:12:54.275
You don't have to take
to these guys, Monty.

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.859
What do you think of
your opponents now, Mr. Brewster?

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:58.110
I think they're slime.
You can quote me on that.

01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.319
Don't quote him on that, please.

01:12:59.419 --> 01:13:00.527
He didn't mean anything by that.

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:02.319
Any prediction on the game this afternoon?

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:05.653
I'm takin' that game more serious than
I am this election, I can tell you that.

01:13:05.753 --> 01:13:08.130
Can we take anything
you say seriously, Mr. Brewster?

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:11.398
It's like that old saying, "If bullshit
were money, I'd be a millionaire."

01:13:11.648 --> 01:13:13.591
Well, I'm a millionaire.

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:19.679
He didn't mean that.
You can't quote him on that.

01:13:19.779 --> 01:13:21.489
Don't you dare quote him on that.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.894
Oh, God, you must be
so nervous about this game today.

01:13:27.994 --> 01:13:29.120
You put everything into it.

01:13:29.328 --> 01:13:31.104
Not everything, but a lot.

01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:34.565
This is my big day.
I'm pitching against the New York Yankees.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:37.709
I can get any team out for three innings.
Any team.

01:13:38.126 --> 01:13:39.902
Good afternoon, sports fans.

01:13:40.002 --> 01:13:43.363
And the New York Yankee
Baseball Network is on the air.

01:13:43.463 --> 01:13:46.156
We've got a special
edition of Yankee baseball,

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:48.866
a special three-inning exhibition game

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.784
between the New York Yankees
and are you ready for this?

01:13:51.884 --> 01:13:54.177
The Hackensack Bulls.

01:13:54.343 --> 01:13:56.160
I know they're the New York Yankees.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.536
You know how many years
I sat around listening to you guys

01:13:58.636 --> 01:14:01.221
complaining about you never get your shot?

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:03.414
Well, today we get our shot.

01:14:03.514 --> 01:14:05.624
There's gonna be sports writers out there.

01:14:05.724 --> 01:14:08.560
Newscasters, TV, radio.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.854
Johnson, you're 26 years old, right?

01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:14.856
You got a great glove. Perfect swing.

01:14:15.106 --> 01:14:16.632
But if you don't
show your stuff out there today,

01:14:16.732 --> 01:14:18.800
nobody's ever gonna know it, man.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.760
Hey, you guys!
Let's go out there and kick a little ass!

01:14:24.529 --> 01:14:27.990
And the Hackensack Bulls
take the playing field!

01:14:34.787 --> 01:14:36.580
That was a great speech
you made, Brewster.

01:14:36.955 --> 01:14:40.499
I know you got something to prove,
but please don't try to show these guys up.

01:14:51.426 --> 01:14:52.468
Let's go, Brew!

01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:54.285
Monty looks so tiny out there.

01:14:54.385 --> 01:14:56.202
Those Yankees look so big.
Can he get hurt?

01:14:56.302 --> 01:14:57.286
Nah. This ain't football.

01:14:57.386 --> 01:14:58.912
All they're gonna do
is just take into his fast balls

01:14:59.012 --> 01:15:00.638
and dent some cars out in the parkin' lot.

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.864
I better move my limousine.

01:15:04.599 --> 01:15:07.158
No votes for Brewster!

01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:13.939
None of the above!

01:15:14.481 --> 01:15:15.840
Hear this crowd go crazy.

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.716
That's for Montgomery Brewster.

01:15:17.816 --> 01:15:20.635
That financial-world wizard
who came on the scene not long ago

01:15:20.735 --> 01:15:23.946
and continues to thrill and delight
the fans of this stadium.

01:15:24.237 --> 01:15:27.156
None of the above! None of the above!

01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:30.784
All right! Let's play ball.

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:36.856
Hackensack Bulls, huh?

01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:37.981
That's the name.

01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:40.232
Robby digs in and we're under way.

01:15:40.332 --> 01:15:44.085
Monty Brewster peers in at his sign
and kicks in the first pitch.

01:15:45.544 --> 01:15:46.819
Change-up?

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:48.086
No, that was his fastball.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:51.504
Breaking ball, I guess you'd have
to call that his change-up, eh, Biff?

01:15:57.676 --> 01:15:59.202
Swing on, it's a hotshot.

01:15:59.302 --> 01:16:00.869
Out!

01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:05.639
You are out.

01:16:07.182 --> 01:16:10.626
Mr. Rough-and-Ready, Ken Dixon
stepping in for the Yanks. Biff?

01:16:10.726 --> 01:16:14.337
Dixon's reputation as a tough
competitor is almost legendary, Vinnie.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:16.547
Hey, Ken Dixon, man.

01:16:16.647 --> 01:16:19.048
It's a pleasure to be on the
same field with you, Mr. Dixon.

01:16:19.148 --> 01:16:21.091
I admire your work. You're a great hitter.

01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:22.967
That pitcher of yours
thinks he's cute, don't he?

01:16:23.067 --> 01:16:24.526
He sure does.

01:16:25.068 --> 01:16:27.594
Hey, you had a great
season this year, Mr. Dixon.

01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:29.053
I saw that game in Boston...

01:16:29.153 --> 01:16:30.261
What, back in June, was it?

01:16:30.361 --> 01:16:32.696
- Saw that game?
- Yeah, I saw that game.

01:16:35.906 --> 01:16:38.766
Oh, I tell you. Great game. Two home runs.

01:16:38.866 --> 01:16:40.558
A triple. Six RBIs.

01:16:40.658 --> 01:16:42.767
I can't believe
you didn't make the all-star team.

01:16:42.867 --> 01:16:44.243
I can't believe it either.

01:16:49.498 --> 01:16:52.250
Two! That was a foul ball.

01:16:53.751 --> 01:16:55.961
Come on, Monty. Keep it in there.
Keep it in there.

01:16:59.839 --> 01:17:02.407
Hey, Dixon, I saw your wife
on television, too.

01:17:02.507 --> 01:17:04.408
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she sure is an ugly bitch.

01:17:04.508 --> 01:17:06.575
- Hey...
- Strike three, you're out!

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.136
- You shut up!
- Get outta here!

01:17:10.511 --> 01:17:11.512
I don't care!

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.497
Get outta here.

01:17:16.181 --> 01:17:17.206
Get outta here.

01:17:17.306 --> 01:17:19.182
- You shut up.
- What did I say?

01:17:19.682 --> 01:17:21.291
What happened, man? What did he say?

01:17:21.391 --> 01:17:23.125
- He called my wife an ugly bitch.
- Oh, come on.

01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:25.168
You're a total snack bar!

01:17:25.268 --> 01:17:27.419
- I'm a snack bar? You're an asshole.
- Come back here.

01:17:27.519 --> 01:17:29.128
It's a very heated exchange.

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:32.439
It looks like this game may have
some real spirit after all, Biff.

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:38.361
It's all right.
All right, all right, come on.

01:17:41.864 --> 01:17:45.074
One word out of you, fat boy,
and you eat your mask.

01:17:45.258 --> 01:17:47.367
You ain't gonna
talk to me the way you did Dixon.

01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:49.660
Hey, can I help it if a guy
can't take a joke?

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.119
Besides, have you ever seen his wife?

01:17:51.219 --> 01:17:52.470
Yeah. Ugly bitch!

01:17:53.888 --> 01:17:56.307
There's a long drive to deep centerfield.

01:17:57.099 --> 01:17:59.392
Back, back, way back.

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.901
But Mike Scharf,
with a brilliant leaping catch...

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:16.289
Exclusively yours
on the Yankee Baseball Network.

01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:19.283
Uh-huh?

01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.160
Warren Cox. I believe you're expecting me.

01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:25.229
Oh, yeah, right. The refund.

01:18:25.329 --> 01:18:29.024
Yes. It's $20,000. That's the receipt.

01:18:29.124 --> 01:18:30.483
Yeah, I'm glad to get rid of it.

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:33.359
Don't like having that kind of money
around here, if you know what I mean.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.360
Didn't make the boss too happy though.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.402
He got all bent out of shape

01:18:36.502 --> 01:18:38.528
when he found out Mr. Brewster
didn't like the furniture he got.

01:18:38.628 --> 01:18:41.797
Oh, yes, it's a pity, but he has no taste.

01:18:45.008 --> 01:18:46.968
Oh, by the way, how's the big game coming?

01:18:47.176 --> 01:18:48.576
Bulls are ahead one-zip.

01:18:48.676 --> 01:18:50.619
Top of the third,
but they're really starting to hit 'em.

01:18:50.719 --> 01:18:51.886
Right.

01:18:53.846 --> 01:18:56.081
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:18:57.681 --> 01:19:01.101
Scharf is walking back,
back, and way back.

01:19:03.977 --> 01:19:08.339
Ken Dixon driving one out of here,
a grand-slam home run

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:11.258
and the Yankees lead it four to one.

01:19:11.358 --> 01:19:14.177
Listen to that scattered applause
here in Hackensack.

01:19:14.277 --> 01:19:16.903
Sounds more like a death knell.

01:19:25.411 --> 01:19:28.271
That is true Yankee
baseball there, my friend.

01:19:28.371 --> 01:19:31.398
And New York Yankee power has burst

01:19:31.498 --> 01:19:33.774
a balloon over Hackensack, New Jersey.

01:19:33.874 --> 01:19:36.860
Wouldn't you know that the Bronx
Bombers would be the bad guys?

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.169
Oh, my!

01:19:44.717 --> 01:19:46.635
Gotta take you out, kid.

01:19:50.805 --> 01:19:52.473
He just got lucky, that's all, Monty.

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:57.877
Hey, you did good, Brewster. Real good.

01:19:57.977 --> 01:19:59.920
I'm proud of you and all the guys.

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.397
Hey, what the hell,
this is the New York Yankees!

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:25.919
Play ball!

01:20:46.356 --> 01:20:47.857
That was a valiant effort.

01:20:48.482 --> 01:20:50.442
Your Uncle Rupert
would've been proud of you.

01:20:52.193 --> 01:20:54.111
I thought my Uncle Rupert
didn't like losers.

01:20:54.736 --> 01:20:57.405
Mr. Brewster,
I don't think you're a loser.

01:20:58.155 --> 01:21:00.515
If it's the money
you're worried about, don't.

01:21:00.615 --> 01:21:02.641
I only have $38,000 left.

01:21:02.741 --> 01:21:04.576
I could spend that tonight in my sleep.

01:21:05.118 --> 01:21:08.145
Yes, but unfortunately
it looks like you could win this election.

01:21:08.245 --> 01:21:11.356
The job carries a $60,000 annual salary

01:21:11.456 --> 01:21:15.918
which I regret to say would be considered
an asset by the terms of the will.

01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:19.654
Okay, here are the final totals.

01:21:19.754 --> 01:21:22.698
For the Yankees to win it,
four runs on four hits...

01:21:22.798 --> 01:21:25.033
Wait a minute.
We might have somethin' goin' on here.

01:21:25.133 --> 01:21:29.620
It looks like Brewster's
gonna address this crowd of folks.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.639
Kill the commercial, fellas.
We're gonna stay right here.

01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:38.234
I'd like to take my hat off
to the Yankees.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:47.192
Anybody can inherit millions of dollars
and buy hisself an election.

01:21:49.027 --> 01:21:52.989
But it takes a real athlete
to be a professional baseball player.

01:21:53.531 --> 01:21:56.016
And that's what all these
gentlemen here are today.

01:21:56.116 --> 01:21:57.992
Real professionals.

01:22:05.415 --> 01:22:08.359
See, the election was supposed
to be a joke.

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:10.752
I didn't expect anybody to vote for me.

01:22:11.169 --> 01:22:12.862
I didn't think anybody
would take me serious.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:16.048
I thought "None of the above"
was a pretty good idea.

01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:19.316
I don't wanna be mayor. I never did.

01:22:23.386 --> 01:22:24.786
How about that, Biff?

01:22:24.886 --> 01:22:27.430
Monty Brewster
is withdrawing from the election.

01:22:29.223 --> 01:22:31.767
It's not all downhill.
I mean, I still got...

01:22:33.185 --> 01:22:34.728
$38,000 left.

01:22:35.854 --> 01:22:39.423
I'm gonna throw a party tonight
back at the hotel in New York

01:22:39.523 --> 01:22:41.524
and you're all invited.

01:23:23.232 --> 01:23:24.274
Hi.

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.486
I thought I'd find you here.

01:23:29.403 --> 01:23:34.240
Listen, since Warren's not around, I thought
maybe I could escort you to the party.

01:23:35.157 --> 01:23:37.767
Monty, I'm real sorry
about you retiring from baseball.

01:23:37.867 --> 01:23:39.184
I know how much it meant to you.

01:23:39.284 --> 01:23:42.603
That's all right. I mean, it happens
to everyone sooner or later.

01:23:42.703 --> 01:23:44.079
It's the nature of the game.

01:23:44.662 --> 01:23:45.746
Yeah.

01:23:47.372 --> 01:23:50.440
Well, I don't think there's anything
left here for me to add up,

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:51.958
so I guess this is goodbye.

01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:54.334
Goodbye? Don't you wanna go to the party?

01:23:54.751 --> 01:23:57.545
Oh, no. I couldn't stand another one.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.114
If you wanna know the truth, I don't see
what you could possibly be celebrating

01:24:01.214 --> 01:24:04.283
unless you think it's okay
to squander $30 million.

01:24:04.383 --> 01:24:07.636
I don't. I just think maybe it was
a phase I was going through.

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:10.954
Listen, tomorrow things will be different.

01:24:11.054 --> 01:24:12.371
I won't be like this anymore.

01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:16.057
Come tomorrow, you are dead broke.
It's all over.

01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:20.501
You don't even have a job playing
baseball anymore, and what do you do?

01:24:20.601 --> 01:24:23.420
You throw a party with your last 38,000!

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.337
Listen to me, I pissed off so much money,

01:24:25.437 --> 01:24:28.297
I figured, "What difference
does $38,000 make?"

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.856
Oh, how dare you?

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.926
That's more money than a lot of
hardworking people earn in a year.

01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:36.177
You better get your values together
'cause you're gonna need 'em.

01:24:36.277 --> 01:24:39.362
Why don't wait until tomorrow,
and then you'll know what this is all about.

01:24:39.462 --> 01:24:40.571
Just forget it, okay?

01:24:40.671 --> 01:24:43.714
And I hope you have fun at that party,
'cause that's all you got left.

01:24:50.721 --> 01:24:52.055
I love you.

01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:21.733
Mr. Donaldo, we're accepting
contributions for Mr. Brewster

01:25:21.833 --> 01:25:23.651
since he's currently insolvent.

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.985
Yeah, Donaldo, Put some money in here now.

01:25:26.085 --> 01:25:27.694
I didn't bring my wallet, guys.

01:25:27.794 --> 01:25:29.027
I thought this was a free party.

01:25:29.127 --> 01:25:30.444
I see. Too bad.

01:25:30.544 --> 01:25:31.986
What do you do with your money,
put it in tin cans?

01:25:32.086 --> 01:25:35.923
You got it, big boy.
This gravy train ain't gonna run forever.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:38.758
Oh, what's this?

01:25:39.967 --> 01:25:44.037
Well, thank you very much.
This is generous of you. Very generous.

01:25:44.137 --> 01:25:46.681
I'm gonna put you
on my Christmas card list.

01:25:49.266 --> 01:25:51.459
How about a glass
of champagne, Mr. Brewster?

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:52.876
How about a bottle of champagne?

01:25:52.976 --> 01:25:53.960
As you wish.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.002
I'm gonna get drunk.

01:25:55.102 --> 01:25:56.436
Monty!

01:25:56.978 --> 01:25:59.505
Monty, good news, pal. Good news.

01:25:59.605 --> 01:26:01.381
Mr. Brewster, I want you to know

01:26:01.481 --> 01:26:04.591
I think you're a hell of a nice man,
and we took up a collection for you.

01:26:04.691 --> 01:26:08.009
I mean, you've paid us all so much money,
we feel bad now that you're broke,

01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:10.236
so would you take this money, please?

01:26:11.111 --> 01:26:13.928
I really appreciate this, you know,
but you know me.

01:26:14.028 --> 01:26:16.447
I'll just spend it. I can't take it.

01:26:16.822 --> 01:26:18.347
Brother, would you take the money, please?

01:26:18.447 --> 01:26:19.806
- I can't.
- Take the money.

01:26:19.906 --> 01:26:20.948
No.

01:26:22.366 --> 01:26:24.017
I know. You don't want charity.

01:26:24.117 --> 01:26:26.310
Forget the charity. Forget that.

01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:28.227
I was gonna save this for a rainy day.

01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:30.203
I'll tell ya now,
I'll tell ya now, it's raining.

01:26:30.453 --> 01:26:32.855
Look, with the exception
of a few nice suits that I bought,

01:26:32.955 --> 01:26:34.539
I saved almost every penny you gave me.

01:26:34.705 --> 01:26:36.690
Now, I got an idea.
And here's what we're gonna do.

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:38.940
We're gonna buy a Corvette,
we're gonna drive across country,

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.774
go to say, the Rocky Mountains.

01:26:40.874 --> 01:26:43.817
We'll buy a cabin there, we'll go fishing
every day, we'll fly in women every other day.

01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:47.653
Spike, you're beautiful, man.
You... You are.

01:26:47.753 --> 01:26:49.671
But you don't know. See, tomorrow...

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:51.338
Yeah?

01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:53.297
Almost let the cat out of the bag.

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.840
I almost let the cat
out of the bag, Uncle Rupert.

01:26:56.173 --> 01:26:57.591
What are you talkin' about?

01:26:58.258 --> 01:27:02.368
See, I can't tell my closest friend,
'cause my Uncle Rupert's a son of a bitch.

01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:04.386
Why? What are you saying?

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:05.828
Uh...

01:27:05.928 --> 01:27:07.596
Hey, it's supposed to be a party.

01:27:08.221 --> 01:27:09.204
It's a party!

01:27:09.304 --> 01:27:11.723
How come everybody
ain't dancing and having a good time?

01:27:12.306 --> 01:27:13.640
I mean, what? Somebody die?

01:27:14.223 --> 01:27:15.974
I gotta get full value for my money.

01:27:16.474 --> 01:27:19.685
Hey, you heard him.
He said he doesn't want it.

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:21.602
Did you really spend all that money?

01:27:30.317 --> 01:27:31.884
Nice friend I turned out to be.

01:27:31.984 --> 01:27:33.510
You give me all that money for what?

01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:34.885
So I could play catch with you?

01:27:34.985 --> 01:27:37.153
Spike, you don't understand.

01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:39.738
Nobody understands.

01:27:40.697 --> 01:27:42.973
I don't even understand anymore.

01:27:43.073 --> 01:27:44.574
And I am sick of money.

01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:48.535
I'm gonna take this
and I'm gonna get tore up.

01:28:01.798 --> 01:28:05.259
Give me a few bottles
of what he's drinking, all right?

01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.056
It's after 3:00, Mr. Brewster.

01:28:59.683 --> 01:29:00.725
Checkout time?

01:29:02.601 --> 01:29:04.436
I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.

01:29:05.937 --> 01:29:08.047
Like I always said, Mr. Carter.

01:29:08.147 --> 01:29:09.898
You're a real nice man.

01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:16.737
I believe everything you're wearing
belongs to us, Mr. Brewster.

01:29:18.613 --> 01:29:19.822
I almost forgot.

01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:28.271
Just the clothes on my back.
That's what they said.

01:29:28.371 --> 01:29:32.458
Piss off $30 million.
Makes a lot of sense, Uncle Rupert.

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.376
You asshole.

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.922
I'm gonna recommend
your shop to all my friends.

01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:41.840
You lease some great clothes.

01:29:42.715 --> 01:29:44.091
All of 'em.

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:46.051
Keep this, too.

01:30:48.154 --> 01:30:49.196
Monty?

01:30:49.988 --> 01:30:52.824
Well, hello. I hardly recognized you.

01:30:54.116 --> 01:30:56.660
It's ready, sir. What do you think?

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.537
Do you like it?

01:31:00.412 --> 01:31:03.164
Marilyn, this is the room I could die in.

01:31:03.556 --> 01:31:04.998
Oh, thank God.

01:31:05.848 --> 01:31:07.808
I'm so glad.

01:31:09.852 --> 01:31:11.228
Okay, boys.

01:31:12.437 --> 01:31:14.105
Take it all back.

01:31:26.784 --> 01:31:29.119
I wish you had the dough
to keep it, Monty.

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:46.661
Taxicab, Mr. Brewster?

01:31:46.761 --> 01:31:50.096
George, I can't afford it now.
I'm outta money.

01:31:51.722 --> 01:31:54.248
You'll never guess
who I voted for this morning.

01:31:54.348 --> 01:31:56.141
None of the above.

01:31:56.975 --> 01:31:58.393
That's good.

01:32:00.144 --> 01:32:01.812
That's real good.

01:32:16.993 --> 01:32:19.186
This is Chuck Fleming in Times Square.

01:32:19.286 --> 01:32:20.996
Well, that newsflash tells it all.

01:32:21.246 --> 01:32:24.605
To add to the confusion of today's events,
former candidate Montgomery Brewster

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:28.691
who withdrew from the campaign only
yesterday, and apparently now dead broke,

01:32:28.791 --> 01:32:30.984
checked out of
his luxury hotel a few hours ago

01:32:31.084 --> 01:32:34.335
wearing the same baseball jersey
and cap he had on 30 days ago.

01:32:34.585 --> 01:32:36.712
Where is he now? Nobody seems to know.

01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:39.780
We followed his rollercoaster
ride of success and failure

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.074
for the last 30 days,
and now it would seem to be over.

01:32:43.174 --> 01:32:46.785
But those of you following
the election results know that that's not so.

01:32:46.885 --> 01:32:48.411
Well, if you're out there, Monty,

01:32:48.511 --> 01:32:51.455
turn on a radio or a TV set
or pick up a newspaper.

01:32:51.555 --> 01:32:55.016
I think you might be proud
of what's happened in this city today.

01:32:55.141 --> 01:32:56.892
Chuck Fleming, Action News.

01:33:14.533 --> 01:33:17.536
Oh, Monty. Just the man I wanted to see.

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.204
I've got wonderful news for you, Monty.

01:33:20.329 --> 01:33:22.230
- I'm not in the mood
- No, wonderful, wonderful news.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.313
- Do you remember...
- No, I'm not in the mood.

01:33:23.413 --> 01:33:26.981
Do you remember the $20,000 that you
gave me as a deposit on the furniture?

01:33:27.081 --> 01:33:30.692
Well, here it is.
You're not broke after all.

01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:32.585
Isn't that fortunate?

01:33:33.752 --> 01:33:34.736
Three minutes.

01:33:34.836 --> 01:33:39.572
I'm sorry to say this, Roundfield,
but our records indicate Brewster still has

01:33:39.672 --> 01:33:42.115
a substantial amount of money.

01:33:42.215 --> 01:33:43.633
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:33:50.221 --> 01:33:52.348
I can't believe it! I quit!

01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:12.033
I guess I didn't do so good.
I still got $20,000 left.

01:34:13.117 --> 01:34:16.578
Look, I know I lost and everything,

01:34:17.078 --> 01:34:19.521
so I'll sign what you want me to sign
and I'll get out of here.

01:34:19.621 --> 01:34:21.313
Give him the quitclaim papers.

01:34:21.413 --> 01:34:22.580
Use my pen.

01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:27.317
Mr. Brewster,
you still have two full minutes.

01:34:27.417 --> 01:34:28.609
Two full minutes for what?

01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:30.669
I blew it. I'm burned out.

01:34:37.424 --> 01:34:39.049
Warren, what are you doing?

01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:41.134
He's about to sign it all away.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:42.451
What are you doing here?

01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:44.244
I'm working late.
Closing out Brewster's account.

01:34:44.344 --> 01:34:45.928
Sign what away?

01:34:47.179 --> 01:34:48.830
I guess I can let you in on it now.

01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:50.831
In a few seconds
I'm gonna be a full partner,

01:34:50.931 --> 01:34:52.874
just as soon as he signs that paper.

01:34:52.974 --> 01:34:55.793
See, the reason that he blew
the $30 million

01:34:55.893 --> 01:34:58.962
was so he could get
his real inheritance of $300 million.

01:34:59.062 --> 01:35:00.855
You mean, he had to spend all that money?

01:35:01.021 --> 01:35:02.213
Why didn't he tell me?

01:35:02.313 --> 01:35:03.630
It was a condition
of his great-uncle's will.

01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:05.798
He had to keep it a secret.

01:35:05.898 --> 01:35:09.341
Well, if it's such a big secret,
how come you know all about it?

01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:11.634
I'm afraid that too is a secret.

01:35:11.734 --> 01:35:14.111
Uh-uh. He did spend that money.
I have all the receipts.

01:35:14.611 --> 01:35:16.637
Maybe you're not as thorough
as you think you are.

01:35:16.737 --> 01:35:18.805
Remember the Dawson and Clark account?

01:35:18.905 --> 01:35:20.615
Fine custom furniture and draperies?

01:35:22.533 --> 01:35:24.201
No! Give me that!

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.227
Monty, stop! Don't sign anything!

01:35:26.327 --> 01:35:28.186
Miss Drake! This is a private meeting.

01:35:28.286 --> 01:35:29.812
Leave or you'll be fired.

01:35:29.912 --> 01:35:30.854
Sign right here, son.

01:35:30.954 --> 01:35:32.855
Warren cheated him.
And these two put him up to it.

01:35:32.955 --> 01:35:35.398
He purposely withheld the $20,000 deposit

01:35:35.498 --> 01:35:37.023
so that Monty would think
he'd already spent it.

01:35:37.123 --> 01:35:38.816
I forgot to give her
the receipt, that's all.

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:40.191
It was a perfectly honest mistake.

01:35:40.291 --> 01:35:43.043
Gentlemen,
is there any truth to this accusation?

01:35:43.501 --> 01:35:46.111
Totally preposterous.
We're completely innocent.

01:35:46.211 --> 01:35:47.629
You are fired, Miss Drake.

01:35:47.795 --> 01:35:48.796
Ooh.

01:35:51.632 --> 01:35:53.992
My lucky day, huh, Warren?

01:35:54.092 --> 01:35:55.968
You're my pal, right?

01:35:56.385 --> 01:35:58.953
You're a liar, Warren. You tricked me!
Set me up!

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.996
No, no, not at all.
That was just a coincidence.

01:36:01.096 --> 01:36:03.764
Hey, you're a terrible liar, Warren,
and an awful decorator.

01:36:04.181 --> 01:36:06.082
Well, it's better than
being a couple of rabbits.

01:36:06.182 --> 01:36:07.541
What are you insinuating?

01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:08.975
You're a big girl. You figure it out.

01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:12.544
Hold it, hold it, hold it, sister.
Take it easy.

01:36:12.644 --> 01:36:14.712
You're a lady.
I want you to remain a lady.

01:36:14.812 --> 01:36:16.588
Oh, that's excellent advice, Mr. Brewster,

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.439
but a little late, don't you think?

01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:20.732
Oh!

01:36:23.484 --> 01:36:25.694
I'm glad you did that,
Brewster, because...

01:36:25.794 --> 01:36:27.695
Because I'm gonna sue you
for so much money

01:36:27.795 --> 01:36:29.780
that you're gonna be
in debt to me for the rest of your life.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.799
How would you like to settle out of court
right now for $20,000 in cash?

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:35.867
Oh, you think
I came down with the last drop of rain?

01:36:35.967 --> 01:36:38.535
I'm not falling for that trick. Uh-uh.
No settlements.

01:36:38.635 --> 01:36:40.077
I'm gonna take you to court, Brewster.

01:36:40.177 --> 01:36:41.702
What are you gonna do about that?

01:36:42.927 --> 01:36:46.288
When that clock strikes 12:00,
you are dead broke for life.

01:36:46.388 --> 01:36:48.932
You're a loser, Brewster. A real loser.

01:36:50.016 --> 01:36:51.166
I'm gonna need an attorney, Miss Drake.

01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:53.042
Will $20,000 be enough of a retainer?

01:36:53.142 --> 01:36:55.043
But I'm just a paralegal.
I don't have a degree.

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:57.710
You can get a degree with $20,000.
It's just an advance.

01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:58.877
You need a receipt!

01:37:00.895 --> 01:37:02.938
I'll give you a receipt.

01:37:04.272 --> 01:37:06.732
Please! Hurry, please.

01:37:18.659 --> 01:37:21.728
As the executor of your great-uncle's will,
I hereby declare

01:37:21.828 --> 01:37:26.524
that the full inheritance
of $300 million is yours.

01:37:26.624 --> 01:37:29.225
- Wow!
- Congratulations.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.819
Gentlemen, I sense conspiracy
to defraud here.

01:37:32.919 --> 01:37:35.362
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have
to order a full investigation,

01:37:35.462 --> 01:37:37.363
with your consent, Mr. Brewster.

01:37:37.463 --> 01:37:40.299
Well... Send 'em to the showers.

01:37:40.716 --> 01:37:42.967
It'll take about 20 years to dry off
where you're goin'.

01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:46.720
Better take a big towel.
Mr. Roundfield, you're a real nice man.

01:37:47.137 --> 01:37:49.455
Thank you very much.
You're a real nice man.

01:37:49.555 --> 01:37:53.308
Uh, Warren, better learn the blues.
You know...

01:37:53.891 --> 01:37:56.626
Hey, baby, I'm sorry I did it

01:37:56.726 --> 01:37:58.669
I didn't mean to do it

01:37:58.769 --> 01:38:00.328
We lost the money...

01:38:05.816 --> 01:38:08.652
I've been looking everywhere

01:38:09.486 --> 01:38:12.363
To find someone who's right

01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:16.032
Sugar man, just to talk to me

01:38:16.782 --> 01:38:19.826
Why don't you take me home tonight

01:38:20.409 --> 01:38:23.412
You were out there all this time

01:38:24.079 --> 01:38:27.356
All the time could have been this time

01:38:27.456 --> 01:38:30.900
How could I ever have been so blind

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.336
I got to you in the nick of time

01:38:36.671 --> 01:38:42.677
Situations call for drastic measures

01:38:43.928 --> 01:38:47.039
Looked like I was going for good

01:38:47.139 --> 01:38:50.708
Till I can start up a neighborhood

01:38:50.808 --> 01:38:56.355
I must admit it took my very best line

01:38:58.398 --> 01:39:01.759
Got to you in the nick of time

01:39:01.859 --> 01:39:04.761
Got to you in the nick of time

01:39:04.861 --> 01:39:08.155
I got to you in the nick of time

01:39:09.197 --> 01:39:11.306
Got to you in the

01:39:11.406 --> 01:39:14.183
Oh, you saved me

01:39:14.283 --> 01:39:17.452
Yeah, you saved me

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:21.539
In a bad situation

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.374
You came along

01:39:26.417 --> 01:39:27.859
Saved me

01:39:27.959 --> 01:39:29.610
Somebody saved me

01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:30.735
You saved me

01:39:30.835 --> 01:39:32.319
Somebody saved me

01:39:32.419 --> 01:39:35.296
I got to you

01:39:47.808 --> 01:39:51.044
Got to you in the nick of time

01:39:51.144 --> 01:39:53.062
I did

01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:03.655
Yeah, got to you

01:40:05.406 --> 01:40:08.909
Yeah, got to you in the nick of time

01:40:09.868 --> 01:40:12.620
Got to you in the nick of time

01:40:13.454 --> 01:40:16.248
Got to you in the nick of time

01:40:34.182 --> 01:40:38.728
Got to you in the nick of time

01:40:48.571 --> 01:40:50.388
Somebody saved me

01:40:50.488 --> 01:40:52.097
In the nick of time

01:40:52.197 --> 01:40:53.806
Somebody saved me

01:40:53.906 --> 01:40:55.432
In the nick of time

01:40:55.532 --> 01:40:57.141
Somebody saved me

01:40:57.241 --> 01:40:58.742
In the nick of time

01:40:59.659 --> 01:41:02.495
Got to you in the nick of time
