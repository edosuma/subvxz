 Don't you guys just love double dates?

00:12.113 --> 00:15.748
 Uh, Fletcher, this is not a double date.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.784
 Yeah, Fletcher.
Olive and I are here on a date.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.121
 You and Chyna are just
here, killing the mood.

00:22.422 --> 00:22.821
 Ow!

00:22.823 --> 00:25.758
 Sorry, Angus, but I don't see
you as more than a friend.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.728
 Actually, I mostly just tolerate
you because you're there.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.463
 That's what my mom says about my dad!

00:31.465 --> 00:34.133
 We're practically married!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.468
 It's nothing personal.

 I just don't want to
waste any brain capacity

00:38.272 --> 00:42.408

love and romance. Ugh!

00:42.410 --> 00:45.144
 Hi, folks.
 Welcome to IHOW.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.012
 Hubba-hubba!

00:47.914 --> 00:50.482
 I'm Graham.
It's a beautiful day to be alive,

00:55.121 --> 00:56.021

 Wow, you're a chef?

00:57.725 --> 01:02.327
 Fletcher's your age and he
barely knows how to use a spoon.

 (SLURPING)

01:08.568 --> 01:09.301
 I was born to cook.

01:09.303 --> 01:13.739
 When I was little, I used the
milk out of my baby bottle

01:13.741 --> 01:16.608
 to make Camembert cheese.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.844
 Interesting "lactoid."

01:18.846 --> 01:23.916
 Of all mammal milks, hippopotamus
milk has the highest mucus content.

01:23.918 --> 01:28.754

01:39.732 --> 01:40.332
 Hey, Hippo.

 So, do you think Graham liked me?

02:42.963 --> 02:46.031
 I tried to charm him with my
knowledge of the culinary arts,

02:46.033 --> 02:50.769

 interesting "snacktoids."

02:51.738 --> 02:52.371
 (CHUCKLES)

02:52.373 --> 02:55.274
 Yes, and I think he particularly
enjoyed the one about

02:55.276 --> 02:59.978
 the amount of rat droppings legally
allowed in a restaurant kitchen.

03:00.780 --> 03:05.083

that amount was "none."

 Fletcher, you pretend to be Graham,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.341
 and Olive, you pretend to be Olive.

for this role my entire life.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.646
 that will make the restaurant even better.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.846
 we could combine with food service.

 And he's in
 the A.N.T. Program?

09:02.476 --> 09:05.343
 Yeah. I mean,
 he's a cooking prodigy,

09:05.345 --> 09:06.711
 so I introduced him to Skidmore

09:06.713 --> 09:09.281
 and he made her his famous bouillabaisse.

09:09.283 --> 09:12.350
 She loved it so much,
 she did a back flip.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.653
 Which landed her in the hospital,

09:14.655 --> 09:18.423

 It's going to be horrible with him here.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.231
 Relax.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.066
 Maybe he's actually a nice guy

10:01.068 --> 10:04.603

was just a one-time thing.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.171
 We should give him a chance.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.308

going to come in here and

10:17.283 --> 10:18.984
 ruin everything.

 What are you doing?

10:21.188 --> 10:24.389

12:14.266 --> 12:16.735
 We're going to share a locker!

12:18.571 --> 12:19.304
 Let me handle this.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.340
 Olive, I want to play
you a song I recorded.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.109
 It's called <i>I've Got</i>
 <i> </i> <i>Something To Tell You</i>

12:24.111 --> 12:28.012
 <i>And I Really Hope</i> <i> </i> <i>It Doesn't
Affect</i> <i> </i> <i>Our Friendship.</i>

12:28.014 --> 12:29.881
 Does it have hand claps in it?

12:29.883 --> 12:32.317
 People love hand claps.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.887
 So, Olive...

12:36.222 --> 12:40.358
 Did I always have sides of
beef hanging in my sound booth?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.761
 Oh, Graham turned it into a meat locker.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.364
 He's so grateful.
He even wrote you a note.

12:47.666 --> 12:51.002
 "Chyna,
 flanks for everything."

12:51.137 --> 12:52.570
 (LAUGHING)

12:52.572 --> 12:55.273
 Flank is a cut of meat!

12:55.908 --> 12:57.709
 Ah, food puns!

12:59.345 --> 13:00.779
 Yeah.
 They're the best!

13:00.781 --> 13:04.682
 Anyway, "lettuce" continue.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.054
 I don't get it.

13:11.223 --> 13:15.426
 Listen, Fletcher, I know we kind
of got off on the wrong foot,

13:15.428 --> 13:18.663
 so I decided to prepare
you a special dish.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.399
 Oh, no. It's okay.
 I already ate.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.334
 No, no, no.
 Please try it.

13:23.336 --> 13:27.138
 It's my special hard boiled quail egg.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.474
 I really think you'll love it.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.779
 Wow.
 This is incredi...

13:34.781 --> 13:35.747
 What are you doing!

13:35.749 --> 13:38.583
 You didn't even put salt on it!

13:39.018 --> 13:42.954
 Who eats a quail egg without salt!

13:43.756 --> 13:46.391
 I don't know.
 A rattlesnake?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.794
 <i>♪ If you break up,</i> <i> </i> <i>I'll bring
you</i> <i> </i> <i>ice cream and tissues</i>

13:49.796 --> 13:54.499
 <i>♪ But I'm telling you</i> <i>that dude's
got</i> <i>some serious issues! ♪</i>

13:55.100 --> 13:57.836
 So?
 What do you think?

13:57.838 --> 14:02.407
 Not bad, but have you
considered adding hand claps?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.010
 Listen, Olive.
 Forget about the song.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.579
 We need to talk.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.147
 About what?

14:09.548 --> 14:10.381
 About Graham.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.816
 I know what this is about.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.752
 You have a problem with me dating him.

14:15.120 --> 14:15.553
 Well, yes.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.955
 You want us to break up.
Yes!

14:16.957 --> 14:19.657
 So you can swoop in and
take him for yourself!

14:19.659 --> 14:21.226
 What? No.
 No, no, no, no...

14:21.228 --> 14:25.096
 Don't deny it, Chyna. You just wrote
a whole song about how great he is.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.366
 Wow, you really did not
listen to the lyrics.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.702
 Just admit it, Chyna.
 You like him!

14:30.704 --> 14:33.705
 No, I don't like him.
 I hate him!

14:35.541 --> 14:37.175
 You hate my boyfriend?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.777
 No! I don't even know
 why I said that.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.947
 Of course I don't hate your boyfriend.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.849
 (WHISPERS) How's it going, Chyna?

14:44.851 --> 14:48.253
 Have you told Olive
 we hate her boyfriend yet?

14:56.362 --> 14:57.228
 I can't believe you.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.832
 I thought you were
supposed to be my friend.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.433
 Olive, wait!

15:02.435 --> 15:03.668
 Come on, Graham.
 We're leaving.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.771
 Okay.
"Lettuce" get out of here.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.608
 (GIGGLES) "Lettuce
get out of here."

15:10.776 --> 15:12.277
 Priceless!

15:12.878 --> 15:13.711
 That was my pun!

15:13.713 --> 15:15.546
 You said you didn't get it!

15:15.548 --> 15:17.715
 It's all in the delivery!

15:20.386 --> 15:21.219
 I hate this.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.921
 It's bad enough Olive's mad at me,

15:22.923 --> 15:25.890
 but she still has no idea
 what a jerk Graham is!

15:25.892 --> 15:29.394
 I guess we're going to have to avoid
them for the rest of our lives.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.695
 Except for when they get married.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.831
 You know the food is going to be awesome.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.068
 You're right.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.237
 Food is what he really cares about.

15:39.239 --> 15:43.374
 So we'll invite them over for
the worst dinner party ever.

15:43.376 --> 15:48.146
 He'll go berserk and she'll
finally see what a jerk he is!

15:48.314 --> 15:49.580
 Just make sure you have salt.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.416
 I may need to use it.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.817
 Or not use it.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.619
 I'm so confused!

15:57.856 --> 15:59.857
 (DOORBELL RINGING)

16:00.392 --> 16:02.260
 Hey, guys!
 Come on in!

16:02.262 --> 16:06.064
 Olive, I really appreciate you
agreeing to come over for dinner.

16:06.066 --> 16:10.969
 Well, I couldn't say no after
you extended this olive branch.

16:11.303 --> 16:17.575
 Well, Graham, I'm pretty sure
you remember Fletcher and Angus.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.210
 (BURPING)

16:20.546 --> 16:21.112
 Of course.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.682
 Here. We brought you some
strawberries from my garden.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.684
 Oh, that's so sweet!

16:26.686 --> 16:27.485
 Too bad I hate strawberries.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.823
 Now put your butts in some
chairs while I throw these away.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.562
 Okey-dokey, artichokey.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.132
 This is also from my garden.

16:44.903 --> 16:48.339
 Uh, Chyna, Graham and I
 don't have any napkins.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.942
 Oh! No problem.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.146
 This is the good stuff.
 Two-ply.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.417
 Thank you, milady.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.488
 I think this fork is dirty.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.257
 Oh. Let me
 clean that for you.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.732
 Yup.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.902
 Thanks.
 That's better.

17:23.642 --> 17:24.541
 And now, you will be amazed

17:24.544 --> 17:30.448
 as I perform the magic
linking onion rings illusion!

17:35.320 --> 17:36.788
 Ta-da!

17:39.324 --> 17:40.158
 Come on, Hippo.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.659
 We've done dancing waitresses,

17:41.661 --> 17:43.394
 we've done magical waitresses.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.998
 Can we please just do singing waitresses?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.501
 No, I was thinking
 about doing the greatest

17:50.503 --> 17:53.704
 performing/waitressing art there is.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.607
 Murder mystery dinner theater!

17:56.609 --> 17:58.543
 Slash waitressing.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.882
 Oh, no. Someone won't be
 leaving here tonight alive.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.852
 And not just because of the food.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.056
 No one move!

18:12.058 --> 18:14.759
 I have shocking news!

18:15.828 --> 18:20.465
 My valet parking guys just took
off with all your car keys.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.166
 And cars.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.469
 So instead of a murder mystery,

18:24.471 --> 18:29.240
 looks like we'll be solving
a grand theft auto mystery.

18:29.242 --> 18:33.878
 And let's be honest,
 we'll never solve it.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.589
 I don't understand.
Why isn't he flipping out?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.290
 Let's kick things up a notch!

18:46.292 --> 18:49.026
 Hey, Graham, can you pass me the ketchup?

18:49.028 --> 18:51.729
 I want to put some on my salad.

18:52.264 --> 18:55.967
 You know what, never mind.
I'll get it myself.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.405
 Graham, have some gumbo.

19:01.407 --> 19:05.643
 It's made with nothing but
the freshest gum. See?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.780
 What are you doing?

19:09.782 --> 19:10.748
 It's a special recipe.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.018
 Me and Chyna came up with it ourselves.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.620
 Don't you mean "Chyna and I"?

19:15.622 --> 19:19.223
 No, me and Chyna.
 You weren't there.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.057
 Stop saying,
 "Me and Chyna."

19:20.059 --> 19:23.594
 "Me" is an objective pronoun and
used as the object of a sentence!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.062
 "I" is a nominative pronoun.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.798
 You mean,
 "I am a nominative pronoun."

19:27.800 --> 19:29.700
 (GROWLING)

19:30.435 --> 19:32.170
 Relax, Olive.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.771
 Yeah, it's just one word.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.906
 Just one word?

19:34.908 --> 19:36.440
 (SHOUTING) Just one word?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.743
 Well, I have one word for you.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.544
 Numbskull!

19:39.546 --> 19:41.812
 Now admittedly, "numbskull"
is a compound word

19:41.814 --> 19:42.914
 made up of two different words,

19:42.916 --> 19:44.515
 but it's spelled without a hyphen!

19:44.517 --> 19:47.652
 Not that you would know!

19:48.020 --> 19:51.556
 Whoa, Olive, what's with the attitude?

19:51.558 --> 19:52.557
 If there's one thing I really don't like,

19:52.559 --> 19:55.860
 it's people who can't control their anger.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.063
 I just don't think this
is going to work out.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.631
 Seriously?
 You're the one who...

20:00.633 --> 20:01.966
 Stay out of this, Fletcher.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.902
 You were breaking up, Graham?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.938
 I'm sorry, Olive, but a person who just

20:06.940 --> 20:12.510
 flies off the handle like that
is not someone I can be with.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.615
 Toodles.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.484
 Did you hear that, guys?

20:20.486 --> 20:23.354
 He said I'm not someone he can be with.

20:23.356 --> 20:27.225
 I'm sorry, Olive.
 You must be really upset.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.392
 I am.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.328
 At his shoddy grammar.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.630
 Ending a sentence with a preposition?

20:32.632 --> 20:36.300
 That is something up with
 which I will not put!

20:36.935 --> 20:40.104
 Well, it doesn't matter why you broke up.

20:40.106 --> 20:44.075
 The important thing is that you broke up.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.076
 Yeah.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.410
 With 30 seconds of hindsight,

20:46.412 --> 20:48.746
 I now see that he wasn't right for me.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.915
 He was too steady and calm.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.719
 I like a guy that's fiery,
 with a bit of a temper.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.320
 (SHOUTING) Oh!

20:56.722 --> 20:58.956
 Is that so?

21:00.559 --> 21:02.026
 (SPLATTERING)

21:02.028 --> 21:05.396
 You know what, I'm not sure what I want.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.732
 I'm gonna go use the little girls' room.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.268
 Wait.
 Hold on a second.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.071
 I don't understand.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.407
 Graham didn't get upset
 at anything we did.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.677
 Well, maybe he's only
 touchy about his own food.

21:19.679 --> 21:24.048
 So our entire plan to eat and
behave like disgusting slobs

21:24.050 --> 21:25.583
 was for nothing?

21:26.418 --> 21:28.019
 We had a plan?

21:34.159 --> 21:37.295
 Thanks for finally agreeing to
let me be a singing waitress.

21:37.297 --> 21:41.065
 And I promise when I'm
discovered and become famous,

21:41.067 --> 21:42.166
 I won't forget you.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.603
 I mean, the memories
 will all be unpleasant,

21:45.704 --> 21:47.772
 but I won't forget you.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.241
 Thanks, Lexi.

21:50.243 --> 21:50.841
 And you're in luck.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.044
 I recognize that guy over there.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.879
 He's a huge music producer.

21:54.881 --> 21:59.450
 Look at him, sitting there
with his two Grammys.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.856
 I can't believe it.
 This is my big chance.
