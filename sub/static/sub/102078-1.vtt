00:56.866 --> 01:00.841
(ominous music continues)

01:00.841 --> 01:03.508
(gunshots fire)

01:06.854 --> 01:08.780
- These guys are like roaches,
they're all over the place.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.070
- We have to get back to Nash.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.736
- Good idea.
Come on.

01:11.736 --> 01:13.369
(gunshots fire)
(man exclaims)

01:13.369 --> 01:16.036

(gunshots fire)

01:33.052 --> 01:35.809
(ominous music)

01:35.809 --> 01:37.017
- Go, go, go, go.

01:37.017 --> 01:39.377
(gunshots fire)

01:39.377 --> 01:40.379
(Winston exclaims)

01:40.379 --> 01:41.539
Fuck!

01:41.539 --> 01:42.909
(man exclaims)

01:42.909 --> 01:43.820
- You're hit.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.236
- Shit my leg.

01:45.236 --> 01:46.359
- We're close to the ridge.

01:46.359 --> 01:48.010
Will be the fourth point
in about four seconds.

01:48.010 --> 01:50.028
(gunshots fire)
- [Winston] Just leave me.

01:50.028 --> 01:51.423
(body thuds)

01:51.423 --> 01:52.256
(gunshots fire)

01:52.256 --> 01:53.303
You're gonna have to leave me behind.

01:53.303 --> 01:54.940
- Bullshit, I'm not leaving anybody.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.508
- I can take out all these scumbags.

01:56.508 --> 01:58.167
- I'm not saying you can't.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.490
(gunshots fire)

02:00.490 --> 02:01.916
- Where is Hubbard?

02:01.916 --> 02:02.856
(gunshots fire)

02:02.856 --> 02:05.250
- Hubbard's gone after them too.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.330
- I'm gonna be a burden.

02:06.330 --> 02:07.327
Just leave me.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.228
- One team, all in, all out.

02:09.228 --> 02:10.450
Winston, stay with him.

02:10.450 --> 02:13.180
- Is Hubbard at the meeting point?

02:13.180 --> 02:14.306
Are we gonna live?

02:14.306 --> 02:15.884
- Of course we're gonna live.

02:15.884 --> 02:17.660
The good guys always win.

02:17.660 --> 02:18.493
(ominous music)
(gunshot fires)

02:18.493 --> 02:19.383
(man exclaims)

02:19.383 --> 02:20.927
Watch him I'm going in.

02:20.927 --> 02:21.996
- [Mara] I've got this.

02:21.996 --> 02:24.015
We're gonna make it.

02:24.015 --> 02:27.500
(ominous music)

02:27.500 --> 02:29.018
- Hubbard.

02:29.018 --> 02:29.851
Hubbard.

02:31.842 --> 02:32.675
Hubbard.

02:34.464 --> 02:35.436
Hubbard, it's me.

02:35.436 --> 02:37.252
- [Hubbard] Nash.

02:37.252 --> 02:38.341
- [Nash] Hubbard.

02:38.341 --> 02:39.174
Come out.

02:42.034 --> 02:44.620
- Winston?
- He got hit.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.761
They're gonna meet us back at the Humvee.

02:45.761 --> 02:47.908
- This will bring down
the entire organization.

02:47.908 --> 02:48.741
- Wait, I thought they were gonna-

02:48.741 --> 02:50.543
- I need to disappear.
- [Nash] What?

02:50.543 --> 02:51.958
- This is worse than anyone knows.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.340
- Wait what about the docs?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.409
- There are no docs, Nash.

02:54.409 --> 02:55.242
- No docs?

02:55.242 --> 02:56.335
- [Hubbard] It was a little lie.

02:56.335 --> 02:59.115
XZ-9, is the deadliest drug

02:59.115 --> 03:00.829
the world has ever known.

03:00.829 --> 03:01.706
- That'll be our secret.

03:01.706 --> 03:02.539
- [Hubbard] Yeah.

03:02.539 --> 03:03.472
- Take to your grave.

03:03.472 --> 03:05.236
- Yeah just don't tell Mara.

03:05.236 --> 03:06.132
- I won't.

03:06.132 --> 03:07.687
- It's the Chinese.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.882
Xieng.

03:08.882 --> 03:09.965
The Wan clan.

03:11.239 --> 03:12.437
I think there's trouble on the inside.

03:12.437 --> 03:13.270
- Wan clan?

03:13.270 --> 03:14.103
What do you mean?

03:14.103 --> 03:16.418
- State side there's a, there's a lab.

03:16.418 --> 03:18.135
The one I told you about.

03:18.135 --> 03:19.679
He'll do whatever it takes.

03:19.679 --> 03:21.572
- That means this was an inside job.

03:21.572 --> 03:23.405
- We're not safe here.

03:24.427 --> 03:26.540
They could be listening right now.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.759
- Will I see you again?

03:28.759 --> 03:31.650
- [Hubbard] Watch your back Nash.

03:31.650 --> 03:33.820
I gotta plan for you.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.153
It's not pretty.

03:36.746 --> 03:39.060
- Be safe partner.

03:39.060 --> 03:42.114
(gunshots fire)

03:42.114 --> 03:43.402
(man exclaims)

03:43.402 --> 03:44.831
(gunshots fire)
(man exclaims)

03:44.831 --> 03:47.498
(ominous music)

03:49.169 --> 03:51.070
(logo whooshes)

03:51.070 --> 03:53.737
(ominous music)

04:08.828 --> 04:10.777
(gunshots fire)

04:10.777 --> 04:13.360
(man exclaims)

04:19.310 --> 04:20.158
- [Mara] Nash.

04:20.158 --> 04:21.228
- Yeah.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.993
(keyboard clicks)

04:22.993 --> 04:24.761
- Mara hey, what's going on?

04:24.761 --> 04:25.594
- It's almost showtime.

04:25.594 --> 04:27.192
- Yeah.
- Coffee.

04:27.192 --> 04:28.230
- I agree in my mind.

04:28.230 --> 04:30.313
- Oh parapsychology is my specialty.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.333
(Nash chuckles)

04:31.333 --> 04:32.822
- I think caffeine is the only

04:32.822 --> 04:35.132
psychology I need at the moment.

04:35.132 --> 04:38.062
So tell me, what are
the theatrics of today?

04:38.062 --> 04:40.153
- Could you open your computer?

04:40.153 --> 04:42.518
Dr. Dina Sloan from last week briefing,

04:42.518 --> 04:44.729
she said to downplay the effects of XZ-9.

04:44.729 --> 04:45.798
We didn't think she'd go through with it

04:45.798 --> 04:48.596
but she announced the stream
last night on social media.

04:48.596 --> 04:50.766
- Is she still dealing with Ukraine?

04:50.766 --> 04:52.251
- Not exactly.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.084
(paper rustle)

04:53.084 --> 04:55.876
Our sources say Hong Kong
but this entire operation is like

04:55.876 --> 04:58.278
an onion wrapped inside a
vortex of power players.

04:58.278 --> 05:00.227
- Yeah I was just thinking about Hubbard.

05:00.227 --> 05:03.564
(gunshot fires)
(ominous music)

05:03.564 --> 05:04.981
- You were close.

05:05.854 --> 05:09.476
- Yeah but now he is gone like the wind.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.940
- Hey, you did all you could.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.414
Your head is just playing games on you.

05:12.414 --> 05:13.942
- No my head is wrapped on tight

05:13.942 --> 05:15.977
and operating at full capacity, trust me.

05:15.977 --> 05:19.217
- Hey, energy weapons
have lingering effects.

05:19.217 --> 05:20.900
I'm here if you wanna talk.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.879
- You know I appreciate that, I really do.

05:24.879 --> 05:27.598
Maybe we'll grab drinks at
that bar I go to sometimes.

05:27.598 --> 05:28.942
- Only if I'd pick up the first round.

05:28.942 --> 05:29.788
- Ah, look at you.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.621
(Nash claps)

05:30.621 --> 05:33.734
You're trying to get an award
for like partner of the year.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.696
Partner of the decade.

05:34.696 --> 05:35.692
- Well, I aim to please.

05:35.692 --> 05:37.084
(both chuckle)

05:37.084 --> 05:38.174
Looks like she's getting ready.

05:38.174 --> 05:39.341
- [Nash] Okay.

05:40.996 --> 05:42.228
- [Dr. Dina] Good afternoon.

05:42.228 --> 05:43.929
I'm Dr. Dina Sloan.

05:43.929 --> 05:45.422
Head of the research panel

05:45.422 --> 05:49.033
and professor emeritus on
XZ-9 at Gillis University.

05:49.033 --> 05:51.529
I've provided a statement
today regarding ZX-9

05:51.529 --> 05:53.561
and I'm gonna share
that all with you today.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.268
- All right doc, enlighten me on

05:55.268 --> 05:57.684
how XZ-9 is no longer a threat.

05:57.684 --> 05:59.622
- Understand that there was a lot of talk

05:59.622 --> 06:01.956
about this drug being
used in certain government

06:01.956 --> 06:04.660
and foreign government funded experiments.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.041
Due to the insistence by
news media and social media,

06:07.041 --> 06:10.929
the infiltration that ZX-9
is a threat to humankind

06:10.929 --> 06:12.520
and that's simply not true.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.110
These are all lies.

06:14.110 --> 06:17.494
I have studied XZ-9 since its creation.

06:17.494 --> 06:19.644
XZ-9 has never been a hostile chemical

06:19.644 --> 06:23.081
especially when mixed
properly with other chemicals.

06:23.081 --> 06:24.740
In fact, we've seen great effects

06:24.740 --> 06:26.924
in the treatment of
many different diseases.

06:26.924 --> 06:29.233
On behalf of my colleagues
at the institute

06:29.233 --> 06:32.889
we will be closing all
research regarding XZ-9

06:32.889 --> 06:35.572
and production as well as
reporting all further findings

06:35.572 --> 06:37.324
through the government's
Ministry of Science

06:37.324 --> 06:39.638
and of course all the
research will be available

06:39.638 --> 06:41.996
to the public as it comes our way.

06:41.996 --> 06:46.345
You have nothing to fear
and the truth will come.

06:46.345 --> 06:47.726
Thank you.

06:47.726 --> 06:51.174
(audience clapping)

06:51.174 --> 06:52.007
- Well looks likes someone's trying

06:52.007 --> 06:53.802
to close the book on XZ-9.

06:53.802 --> 06:54.635
- Fear the pages of that book

06:54.635 --> 06:56.634
have already being torn to shreds.

06:56.634 --> 06:59.162
- So the old narrative still stands.

06:59.162 --> 07:00.810
- I sent you all of Hubbard's reports.

07:00.810 --> 07:02.120
Read them over again and align to this

07:02.120 --> 07:03.454
'cause something doesn't add up.

07:03.454 --> 07:06.171
- So what'd you know about Dr. Dina?

07:06.171 --> 07:07.600
- You saw the speech.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.586
Believable.

07:08.586 --> 07:09.620
- It's bullshit.

07:09.620 --> 07:10.549
- How do you know?

07:10.549 --> 07:12.528
- Can I tell you what I know about XZ-9?

07:12.528 --> 07:13.504
About five years ago,

07:13.504 --> 07:15.408
the Chinese government and
a pharmaceutical company

07:15.408 --> 07:18.840
were working together on a super drug.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.940
It actually worked and
these guys were stronger,

07:20.940 --> 07:22.322
smarter, faster.

07:22.322 --> 07:25.285
They tested on Chinese soldiers.

07:25.285 --> 07:27.210
Well nine months these guys were dying.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.045
I mean would drop like flies.

07:29.045 --> 07:30.821
When the government found
out the soldiers was dying,

07:30.821 --> 07:33.389
started blaming the US Special Ops team.

07:33.389 --> 07:36.117
Hubbard and I were of that team.

07:36.117 --> 07:39.007
(Mara sighs)

07:39.007 --> 07:40.208
- Well our social media ops are already

07:40.208 --> 07:42.791
pushing the official narrative.

07:45.248 --> 07:46.510
- Winston?

07:46.510 --> 07:47.417
- That's your next meeting?

07:47.417 --> 07:48.250
Mine too.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.253
- Okay.

07:49.253 --> 07:51.279
I mean we've got a few
minutes I can meet you there.

07:51.279 --> 07:52.810
- We do.

07:52.810 --> 07:53.951
(phone rings)

07:53.951 --> 07:55.018
- You better get that.

07:55.018 --> 07:56.525
- Yeah.

07:56.525 --> 07:57.520
Right, I'll catch up soon.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.353
- Yeah.

07:59.715 --> 08:02.373
(paper rustles)

08:02.373 --> 08:05.040
(ominous music)

08:09.673 --> 08:10.979
- [Dr. Dina] There's
never been an intention

08:10.979 --> 08:12.048
to use XZ-9
(Mr. Wan laughs)

08:12.048 --> 08:15.094
as a malicious agent or
as a chemical weapon.

08:15.094 --> 08:18.173
If we as free citizens
and the democratic society

08:18.173 --> 08:19.935
can spend more time looking at
- Yes.

08:19.935 --> 08:22.608
- the actual findings of this
situation rather than doing-

08:22.608 --> 08:23.874
(keyboard clicks)

08:23.874 --> 08:25.535
(ominous music continues)

08:25.535 --> 08:28.285
(Mr. Wan laughs)

08:31.054 --> 08:33.516
- You don't realize what
you did little girl.

08:33.516 --> 08:36.900
(Mr. Wan laughs hysterically)

08:36.900 --> 08:39.567
(buttons click)

08:40.663 --> 08:42.207
I want you to find out

08:42.207 --> 08:45.356
where Dr. Sloan does her business.

08:45.356 --> 08:46.738
Her little PR stunt

08:46.738 --> 08:49.999
just pushed up one step
closer to our goal.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.903
(Mr. Wan laughs)

08:51.903 --> 08:54.403
(phone thuds)

08:55.860 --> 08:59.796
You will soon find out
the wrath of Wan clan.

08:59.796 --> 09:02.027
(Mr. Wan laughs hysterically)

09:02.027 --> 09:04.694
(ominous music)

09:08.902 --> 09:10.240
(Mr. Wan chuckles)

09:10.240 --> 09:12.573
I got the best in the world.

09:13.723 --> 09:14.806
Check it out.

09:17.235 --> 09:19.395
(ominous music)

09:19.395 --> 09:21.112
This nerve drug

09:21.112 --> 09:22.958
will change the world.

09:22.958 --> 09:23.791
Check it out.

09:23.791 --> 09:24.919
- Let me see it.

09:24.919 --> 09:28.419
(ominous music continues)

09:32.650 --> 09:34.066
- It's good?

09:34.066 --> 09:37.247
(man speaks in foreign language)

09:37.247 --> 09:38.628
- What you want to sell me?

09:38.628 --> 09:39.490
Soap?

09:39.490 --> 09:40.323
- What?

09:40.323 --> 09:42.378
- Never fucking try it again.

09:42.378 --> 09:44.234
- That's the best.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.887
(Mr. Wan laughs)

09:45.887 --> 09:47.663
- You are crazy.

09:47.663 --> 09:51.135
Never try to screw me again, okay?

09:51.135 --> 09:52.863
- Nobody crossing me.

09:52.863 --> 09:57.863
(ominous music)
(gunshot fires)

10:05.261 --> 10:06.094
- Dexter,

10:06.094 --> 10:07.082
Winston

10:07.082 --> 10:08.801
and where's Mara?

10:08.801 --> 10:09.926
Oh.
(Nash chuckles)

10:09.926 --> 10:10.926
Hey.
- Sorry.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.826
- Nash thought you were out sick.

10:14.826 --> 10:16.221
You look like a million bucks.

10:16.221 --> 10:17.173
(Nash laughs)

10:17.173 --> 10:18.006
- Well thank you.

10:18.006 --> 10:19.215
I feel like shit but I'm here.

10:19.215 --> 10:20.991
- Oh, you just need a vacation.

10:20.991 --> 10:21.989
Take some time off.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.719
- Nah, I'm not doing vacations.

10:23.719 --> 10:25.775
Especially when everything
smells like shit.

10:25.775 --> 10:26.763
There's a lot of shit on desk.

10:26.763 --> 10:29.219
I can't sleep, can't focus so.

10:29.219 --> 10:30.052
(Nash mumbles)

10:30.052 --> 10:31.170
- I just ran data on the conference.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.982
It seems the general population is moving

10:32.982 --> 10:34.003
in the intended direction.

10:34.003 --> 10:35.669
- Good.
- And if they don't,

10:35.669 --> 10:36.693
we'll just keep what's in the air ways.

10:36.693 --> 10:37.860
They'll learn.

10:39.712 --> 10:40.545
- Yeah.

10:40.545 --> 10:42.834
Our Russian teams in the Chinese firms

10:42.834 --> 10:44.645
are working in our favor on this.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.770
In fact soon, the only people
that will be mentioning

10:46.770 --> 10:49.637
about the XZ-9 operation is

10:49.637 --> 10:52.714
conspiracy nut jobs and
intellectual obscureness.

10:52.714 --> 10:53.909
(Nash laughs)

10:53.909 --> 10:55.349
- You've got a couple of big words.

10:55.349 --> 10:57.741
- I've been reading books, should try.

10:57.741 --> 10:58.845
(Nash exclaims)

10:58.845 --> 11:01.032
- Detect a little bit of hostility.

11:01.032 --> 11:04.028
Was making a joke.
We are all in the same team here

11:04.028 --> 11:05.869
and we're all the same type okay?

11:05.869 --> 11:07.378
- Precisely, in fact,

11:07.378 --> 11:09.386
that's why we're gonna
start moving more rapidly

11:09.386 --> 11:11.858
on the XZ-9 operation.

11:11.858 --> 11:12.880
In fact, right before this meeting

11:12.880 --> 11:14.149
I was told that there was talk

11:14.149 --> 11:16.770
of moving the shipment to Hawaii.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.805
- The Pacific lab.

11:18.805 --> 11:20.397
No, no, we'll never get results.

11:20.397 --> 11:21.906
I've been trying to tell
him McCalsky for weeks.

11:21.906 --> 11:23.425
- No there's more to it though.

11:23.425 --> 11:27.402
We were going to recruit
this Dr. Dina's partner.

11:27.402 --> 11:28.865
The Chinese are funding him.

11:28.865 --> 11:30.712
It's this Dr. Xieng.

11:30.712 --> 11:31.618
- [Nash] Okay.

11:31.618 --> 11:32.576
Okay.

11:32.576 --> 11:33.480
I want in on the access.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.313
- [Winston] Actually no.

11:34.313 --> 11:36.029
Dexter and I can handle this one.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.888
We'll just brief you on the,

11:37.888 --> 11:38.973
on the interrogation.

11:38.973 --> 11:39.806
- Okay.

11:39.806 --> 11:41.559
Anything happen to the XZ-9 I
want more information on so.

11:41.559 --> 11:44.581
I'll you guys do the interrogation,
I'll review the tapes.

11:44.581 --> 11:45.893
- Smart man.

11:45.893 --> 11:46.869
- But not smart enough.

11:46.869 --> 11:48.493
It seems like you guys
have this all handled

11:48.493 --> 11:49.794
and taken care of so

11:49.794 --> 11:51.186
just keep me in the loop.

11:51.186 --> 11:52.019
I'ma head out.

11:52.019 --> 11:53.576
I'll be on call okay?

11:53.576 --> 11:54.469
- Nash.

11:54.469 --> 11:55.302
- Yeah.

11:55.302 --> 11:58.352
- You know I hear down there
in Florida is nice these days.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.010
The sun, the beaches.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.869
Nice place to get your head in order.

12:01.869 --> 12:02.949
- I think my mind's in order.

12:02.949 --> 12:05.165
If I need some tips on vacation,

12:05.165 --> 12:08.138
I'll give you a call okay?

12:08.138 --> 12:08.971
Good day.

12:12.445 --> 12:13.983
- He doing okay?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.968
- He's been upset about Hubbard.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.525
- Oh you mean the warehouse.

12:17.525 --> 12:19.765
Operation Golden Tiger, right?

12:19.765 --> 12:21.314
- [Mara] I believe so.

12:21.314 --> 12:23.658
- Did he ever mention
that Hubbard said anything

12:23.658 --> 12:25.261
before he went AWOL?

12:25.261 --> 12:26.213
- What do you mean?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.861
- [Winston] Well did he say
any like parting messages

12:28.861 --> 12:30.314
so to speak?

12:30.314 --> 12:31.394
- Nash never told me.

12:31.394 --> 12:33.938
- [Dexter] Yeah you are
close though, right?

12:33.938 --> 12:36.829
- We're friends and colleagues.

12:36.829 --> 12:38.244
- Friends?

12:38.244 --> 12:41.461
- Is it against office protocol
to have friends Dexter?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.610
- No.

12:42.610 --> 12:43.898
No it's not.

12:43.898 --> 12:46.231
- All I know is Nash
is one of our best men.

12:46.231 --> 12:48.346
What he did in Iraq is beyond courageous.

12:48.346 --> 12:50.096
Not to mention his covert work.

12:50.096 --> 12:51.579
Moscow, Cuba.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.672
He suffered irreparable brain damage

12:53.672 --> 12:56.025
from those cold war techniques
and still he's smarter

12:56.025 --> 12:58.616
and just as lethal as our
top agents in the field.

12:58.616 --> 13:01.101
- Does he have any family in town?

13:01.101 --> 13:03.376
- I think his sister Brenda, she's around.

13:03.376 --> 13:04.386
Other than that I don't know.

13:04.386 --> 13:05.638
- [Dexter] Mara.

13:05.638 --> 13:06.471
All right.

13:06.471 --> 13:08.101
You too make a strong team.

13:08.101 --> 13:10.768
You know about XZ-9 as does Nash

13:12.352 --> 13:14.392
but we got this.

13:14.392 --> 13:15.692
Right?

13:15.692 --> 13:18.359
Take care of him, he needs help.

13:20.042 --> 13:22.085
- Yeah.
Excuse me.

13:22.085 --> 13:24.896
(footsteps pattering)

13:24.896 --> 13:26.216
(Winston sighs)

13:26.216 --> 13:29.666
- Looks like we have a
lot of work ahead of us.

13:29.666 --> 13:33.261
(ominous music)
(footsteps pattering)

13:33.261 --> 13:34.642
- Yeah.

13:34.642 --> 13:38.142
(ominous music continues)

13:40.491 --> 13:44.184
So sorry about the way it, Mr. Xieng Huey

13:44.184 --> 13:47.546
Things get a little busy around
here as I'm sure you know.

13:47.546 --> 13:49.879
(gun cocks)

13:50.813 --> 13:51.952
(gun thuds softly)

13:51.952 --> 13:54.785
(chair screeches)

13:57.037 --> 13:59.128
Are you Mr. Xieng Huey?

13:59.128 --> 14:02.045
Are you Mr. Xieng Huey from Yunnan?

14:10.608 --> 14:13.605
Mr. Xieng Huey is it true
that you've been dealing with

14:13.605 --> 14:17.772
poisons and other lab
equipment for over 15 years?

14:20.245 --> 14:21.941
I need you to know that
the more you participate

14:21.941 --> 14:24.274
the easier this is gonna be.

14:25.818 --> 14:28.347
We have you tied to
connections with a killing,

14:28.347 --> 14:30.055
a poisoned victim.

14:30.055 --> 14:32.202
Do you know anything about that?

14:32.202 --> 14:34.702
(eerie music)

14:36.756 --> 14:38.686
- Hi, I'm rich.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.764
- Is that your name or
you got a lot of money?

14:40.764 --> 14:41.694
- Yeah I have a lot of money.

14:41.694 --> 14:43.505
You wanna come with me?

14:43.505 --> 14:45.001
- Why don't we cheers to that first?

14:45.001 --> 14:46.255
- Okay.

14:46.255 --> 14:48.922
(ominous music)

14:52.118 --> 14:55.009
- I only have so much patience.

14:55.009 --> 14:58.481
The more you cooperate
the better this will be.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.617
I'm gonna ask you one
more time, Mr. Xieng Huey.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.508
Were you involved

15:03.508 --> 15:05.283
in the poisoning

15:05.283 --> 15:08.302
of a Buller Miller Johnson one week ago?

15:08.302 --> 15:12.065
(ominous music continues)

15:12.065 --> 15:14.115
(Buller groans)

15:14.115 --> 15:16.782
(tumbler thuds)

15:29.370 --> 15:30.810
(Dexter sniffs)

15:30.810 --> 15:31.643
Okay.

15:32.516 --> 15:36.016
(ominous music continues)

15:43.418 --> 15:44.847
(file thuds)

15:44.847 --> 15:47.430
(Dexter sighs)

15:49.234 --> 15:53.520
- That was the saddest
interrogation scene I've ever seen.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.847
- He's not bucking it.

15:54.847 --> 15:56.450
I can't get anything out of him.

15:56.450 --> 16:00.397
- I need you to go back in
there and break his skull open.

16:00.397 --> 16:03.230
I need you to get inside his mind.

16:04.483 --> 16:06.483
- You know I can do that

16:08.104 --> 16:10.256
but I'm gonna need a favor from you.

16:10.256 --> 16:11.423
- What's that?

16:13.027 --> 16:14.640
- I need two minutes alone.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.130
No cameras, no nothing.

16:16.130 --> 16:17.093
That's all I need.

16:17.093 --> 16:18.739
Two minutes.

16:18.739 --> 16:19.786
- Okay.

16:19.786 --> 16:21.341
I'll do that.

16:21.341 --> 16:23.008
- That's all I need.

16:28.285 --> 16:30.478
Got good news, Mr. Xieng Huey.

16:30.478 --> 16:32.013
(file thuds)

16:32.013 --> 16:34.846
Well good news for me not for you.

16:36.501 --> 16:41.208
Were you involved in the
murder of Buller Johnson?

16:41.208 --> 16:46.208
(ominous music)
(chair thuds)

16:48.776 --> 16:50.608
I'm gonna ask one more time.

16:50.608 --> 16:54.290
Were you involved in the
murder of Buller Johnson?

16:54.290 --> 16:56.026
(Mr. Xieng speaks foreign language)

16:56.026 --> 16:56.859
What?

16:58.232 --> 17:00.298
(Mr. Xieng Huey speaks foreign language)

17:00.298 --> 17:02.965
(ominous music)

17:09.330 --> 17:11.154
- Well that's then.

17:11.154 --> 17:13.314
We have to take out the doctors.

17:13.314 --> 17:16.400
Her friends in Singapore are in standby.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.432
- Well what about the locals?

17:19.432 --> 17:20.767
- The Wan clan?

17:20.767 --> 17:22.194
Screw them.

17:22.194 --> 17:23.361
They talk big.

17:24.328 --> 17:26.392
When they have to fill a contract,

17:26.392 --> 17:27.546
we always come up short.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.082
- What it's sounding like is that

17:29.082 --> 17:31.665
we have nothing to worry about.

17:32.759 --> 17:34.573
Aren't they directly
associated with Singapore?

17:34.573 --> 17:35.406
- Look,

17:36.569 --> 17:38.429
I'll handle the movement,

17:38.429 --> 17:40.970
we just have to get to that shipment first

17:40.970 --> 17:43.376
and Nash,
(Dexter sighs)

17:43.376 --> 17:44.443
I don't know

17:44.443 --> 17:45.550
I have a feeling he's more trouble

17:45.550 --> 17:47.594
than what we bargained on.

17:47.594 --> 17:49.499
- I've got somebody telling him right now.

17:49.499 --> 17:50.915
- Yeah?

17:50.915 --> 17:52.678
You know, I think you
just gave me an idea.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.083
- Yeah, what's that?

17:54.083 --> 17:55.500
- [Winston] Well,

17:56.664 --> 18:00.205
maybe the Wan clan can be
of some use to us still.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.038
- What?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.997
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hang on.

18:02.997 --> 18:05.039
We know that they are way
too closely associated

18:05.039 --> 18:07.071
with official government business.

18:07.071 --> 18:08.737
Okay?
We, every time we work with them

18:08.737 --> 18:11.070
they always find a way to...

18:12.146 --> 18:13.237
I don't trust them.

18:13.237 --> 18:14.954
I don't like it.

18:14.954 --> 18:18.031
- They feed on whatever we give them and

18:18.031 --> 18:21.213
they'll disappear soon enough.

18:21.213 --> 18:22.850
- Sounds like things
are going to get messy.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.266
- No Dexter,

18:24.266 --> 18:26.823
things are gonna be very clean.

18:26.823 --> 18:28.961
It's a dawn of a new day

18:28.961 --> 18:31.961
and once we get control of the XZ-9,

18:33.010 --> 18:35.647
we'll show the world
what damage really is.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.314
(ominous music)

18:40.983 --> 18:42.985
- Do we have plans for this weekend?

18:42.985 --> 18:45.486
- [Mr. Xieng] Not so much.

18:45.486 --> 18:47.403
All right, what's next?

18:48.559 --> 18:50.258
- Don't forget these XZ-9 samples

18:50.258 --> 18:51.917
have to be shipped off tomorrow.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.431
- Oh goodness.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.242
You're right.

18:55.242 --> 18:57.575
I would have totally forgot.

18:58.506 --> 19:00.213
Hey can you hand me some fresh gloves?

19:00.213 --> 19:01.046
- Okay.

19:03.563 --> 19:06.378
(ominous music)

19:06.378 --> 19:07.545
- Who are you?

19:08.928 --> 19:12.717
(woman speaks foreign language)

19:12.717 --> 19:14.538
You can't be in here.

19:14.538 --> 19:15.717
(woman exclaims)
(body thuds)

19:15.717 --> 19:18.573
(man exclaims)

19:18.573 --> 19:22.823
(woman speaks in foreign language)

19:24.365 --> 19:28.615
(woman speaks in foreign language)

19:32.249 --> 19:33.863
- [Nash] I'm actually curious as to

19:33.863 --> 19:36.335
what happened to the footage
from you guys' investigation.

19:36.335 --> 19:37.647
The cameras were off when I came inside.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.784
- Well, it seems like we
were a victim of a hacking

19:39.784 --> 19:41.560
probably from a foreign country but

19:41.560 --> 19:44.218
I had my own team
investigating that right now

19:44.218 --> 19:45.622
and trust me,

19:45.622 --> 19:46.901
we'll keep the lawyers at bay.

19:46.901 --> 19:47.864
- [Nash] We got hacked?

19:47.864 --> 19:50.477
Why didn't you bring this
to my attention earlier?

19:50.477 --> 19:53.817
- Well, we just figured
it out a couple hours ago

19:53.817 --> 19:57.232
and so I'd like to be ahead
of the ball and I'm on it.

19:57.232 --> 19:59.312
I'm taking some more stuff off your plate.

19:59.312 --> 20:00.704
- [Dexter] We'll get the
cameras back up and running

20:00.704 --> 20:02.504
and we'll put him back down,
cross reference everybody

20:02.504 --> 20:04.372
that we have the confession from him.

20:04.372 --> 20:05.205
That's not a problem.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.038
- You-
- We already have

20:06.038 --> 20:08.008
the confessional on him.
We can pull him out again and
we can ask him one more time.

20:08.008 --> 20:09.146
- The confession is a problem.

20:09.146 --> 20:11.840
I don't trust any investigations
or any interrogations

20:11.840 --> 20:13.324
that have not been recorded.

20:13.324 --> 20:15.426
You guys just wait, let me get more intel.

20:15.426 --> 20:18.549
I'll circle back with you
guys in about 24 hours, okay?

20:18.549 --> 20:20.256
- And you authorized those operatives

20:20.256 --> 20:22.554
to be out in the field.

20:22.554 --> 20:26.514
- Those Ops have been out in
the field for over two years.

20:26.514 --> 20:28.279
I'm sure whatever intel they give me

20:28.279 --> 20:30.090
I get right back to you guys shortly.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.564
So for right now,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.147
take some time off.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.597
- Looks like it's time
to take out agent Nash.

20:41.597 --> 20:42.850
- How are we gonna do that?

20:42.850 --> 20:44.289
(ominous music)

20:44.289 --> 20:45.559
He's the head of the department.

20:45.559 --> 20:47.487
- You need to figure that out.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.503
Which I fully trust that you will.

20:49.503 --> 20:52.321
(ominous music continues)

20:52.321 --> 20:57.242
(Mr. Xieng speaks in foreign language)

20:57.242 --> 21:00.781
(ominous music continues)

21:00.781 --> 21:02.362
- [Dexter] Jesus Christ.

21:02.362 --> 21:06.692
- [Winston] It looks like
somebody did our job for us.

21:06.692 --> 21:09.257
- I don't like the look of this.

21:09.257 --> 21:10.813
(Mr. Xieng speaks in foreign language)

21:10.813 --> 21:13.563
(woman whistles)

21:14.857 --> 21:17.782
- We're always one step
behind but look what I found.

21:17.782 --> 21:18.615
- What is this?

21:18.615 --> 21:19.770
- Nuclear cyanide.

21:19.770 --> 21:20.687
- Oh Jesus.

21:21.825 --> 21:23.020
- Lethal.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.727
- What do with that?

21:24.727 --> 21:26.506
- We'll be able to use it later trust me.

21:26.506 --> 21:29.802
(ominous music)

21:29.802 --> 21:32.802
(Mr. Xieng screams)

21:35.583 --> 21:37.151
- Our friend at CIA

21:37.151 --> 21:39.332
was surprised by your speed.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.458
- When does the payment go through?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.873
- When you and your crew

21:43.873 --> 21:45.788
complete the job.

21:45.788 --> 21:48.239
- You're jerking us around Wan.

21:48.239 --> 21:50.037
We know we did the deed

21:50.037 --> 21:52.264
and now you're trying to maneuver.

21:52.264 --> 21:53.205
What gives?

21:53.205 --> 21:54.914
- The words on the street,

21:54.914 --> 21:56.388
Xieng is not dead.

21:56.388 --> 21:57.502
- That's impossible.

21:57.502 --> 21:59.047
- Impossible?

21:59.047 --> 22:02.076
He's at the Beverly hospital now room 237.

22:02.076 --> 22:04.202
You know what you have to do.

22:04.202 --> 22:06.514
- Let me tell you this,

22:06.514 --> 22:08.514
they only hire the best.

22:09.658 --> 22:11.458
They do their job

22:11.458 --> 22:13.119
and they do it right.

22:13.119 --> 22:16.266
I don't wanna see you again Wan.

22:16.266 --> 22:17.766
Once this is over,

22:18.762 --> 22:19.679
we're done.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.836
- Get outta here.

22:22.836 --> 22:26.924
(ominous music continues)

22:26.924 --> 22:29.757
(keyboard clicks)

22:31.886 --> 22:34.469
(somber music)

22:38.121 --> 22:39.038
- Hey Mara.

22:40.632 --> 22:41.679
(Nash sighs)

22:41.679 --> 22:43.371
Something doesn't sit right with me.

22:43.371 --> 22:45.498
- What you thinking about?

22:45.498 --> 22:46.922
- You know when

22:46.922 --> 22:48.540
the Chinese government blamed my unit

22:48.540 --> 22:50.119
for the death of those soldiers,

22:50.119 --> 22:52.951
there was two things the
CIA couldn't figure out.

22:52.951 --> 22:55.447
One, who owned the pharmaceutical company

22:55.447 --> 22:59.364
and two what exactly was
the compound for XZ-9.

23:01.404 --> 23:02.564
Where's Dexter and Winston?

23:02.564 --> 23:03.741
- Last I met them they seemed worried

23:03.741 --> 23:05.272
about your mental condition.

23:05.272 --> 23:06.107
(Nash scoffs)

23:06.107 --> 23:08.167
- You think they're really worried
about my mental condition?

23:08.167 --> 23:10.107
- [Mara] No.
- Exactly

23:10.107 --> 23:11.569
but it's fine I'm gonna

23:11.569 --> 23:14.147
do my own digging into
what those guys are up to

23:14.147 --> 23:15.587
'cause I don't trust him for shit.

23:15.587 --> 23:16.539
- Should I run a report?

23:16.539 --> 23:17.372
- No, no, no.

23:17.372 --> 23:19.731
Just, just be careful.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.564
Be on look out.

23:20.564 --> 23:21.397
- Okay.

23:22.257 --> 23:23.262
You going out tonight?

23:23.262 --> 23:25.294
- No, I'm actually going
to be staying here.

23:25.294 --> 23:26.950
My sister's coming to visit.

23:26.950 --> 23:29.235
She was on vacation in St. Thomas.

23:29.235 --> 23:31.779
So we're gonna relax, make some food,

23:31.779 --> 23:33.777
have some drinks, catch up.

23:33.777 --> 23:34.926
You should join.

23:34.926 --> 23:36.155
- Sounds nice.

23:36.155 --> 23:38.419
If I can finish this report.

23:38.419 --> 23:39.347
- Don't overwork yourself.

23:39.347 --> 23:41.123
Knock that stuff out and
come hang out with us.

23:41.123 --> 23:42.123
- All right.

23:43.852 --> 23:46.519
(ominous music)

23:50.587 --> 23:52.141
- Here's the best shot we have

23:52.141 --> 23:54.155
to take out our little problem.

23:54.155 --> 23:57.655
(ominous music continues)

23:59.657 --> 24:00.665
- All right let's get it over with.

24:00.665 --> 24:02.146
- Be confident.

24:02.146 --> 24:07.146
(ominous music)
(machine beeps)

24:11.374 --> 24:14.009
Make sure you drank it.

24:14.009 --> 24:15.092
Nighty night.

24:16.819 --> 24:19.138
(Mr. Xieng coughs)

24:19.138 --> 24:22.088
(machine beeps rapidly)

24:22.088 --> 24:23.096
- Is it done?

24:23.096 --> 24:24.762
- It's done.
- A thousand percent.

24:24.762 --> 24:25.723
I don't want to come back.

24:25.723 --> 24:29.556
- You won't hear a peep
from this guy anymore.

24:33.382 --> 24:38.382
(ominous music)
(machine beeps)

24:48.128 --> 24:50.795
(ominous music)

24:54.806 --> 24:55.944
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:55.944 --> 24:56.883
Hey you guys can't be here.

24:56.883 --> 24:58.030
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.262
(man exclaims)
(man groans)

25:01.262 --> 25:02.262
There we go.

25:03.303 --> 25:04.136
Hey.
(woman exclaims)

25:04.136 --> 25:05.039
(man groans)

25:05.039 --> 25:07.502
(body thuds)

25:07.502 --> 25:09.470
(body thuds)

25:09.470 --> 25:10.435
- No mistakes.

25:10.435 --> 25:11.268
Come on.

25:11.268 --> 25:12.101
(Dexter coughs)
We gotta get out of here.

25:12.101 --> 25:14.865
- [Dexter] I just got my ass kicked.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.532
(ominous music)

25:20.089 --> 25:22.249
(door clicks)

25:22.249 --> 25:23.862
(keys jingle)

25:23.862 --> 25:24.963
- Well hey.

25:24.963 --> 25:26.078
You look like you were sleeping.

25:26.078 --> 25:28.297
- No, No.
Just thinking.

25:28.297 --> 25:29.806
How's it going?

25:29.806 --> 25:31.769
Good to see you.
(Brenda mumbles)

25:31.769 --> 25:33.243
- Nice to see you too bro.
- I missed you.

25:33.243 --> 25:34.798
- Missed you too.

25:34.798 --> 25:36.761
- Have a seat.

25:36.761 --> 25:38.142
How was your flight?

25:38.142 --> 25:39.721
- Long but you know how that goes.

25:39.721 --> 25:40.777
- Yeah true (mumbles)
(Brenda mumbles)

25:40.777 --> 25:42.784
- People, flights

25:42.784 --> 25:44.538
(Brenda mumbles)

25:44.538 --> 25:46.030
- Well here it is.

25:46.030 --> 25:48.038
I have a new place.

25:48.038 --> 25:50.974
- Could use a woman's touch but it's nice.

25:50.974 --> 25:51.807
I like it.

25:51.807 --> 25:53.086
(both chuckle)

25:53.086 --> 25:54.222
Always thinking.

25:54.222 --> 25:55.190
Let me guess, you're probably thinking

25:55.190 --> 25:57.282
about some top CIA mission tomorrow

25:57.282 --> 25:58.989
where you gon' deliver some golden gems

25:58.989 --> 25:59.920
and on the top of space mountain?

25:59.920 --> 26:04.009
- No actually I was thinking about dinner.

26:04.009 --> 26:07.954
- Oh, well, well, well me no
not protest, please come on.

26:07.954 --> 26:08.787
(Nash chuckles)

26:08.787 --> 26:09.620
Get your ass up.

26:09.620 --> 26:11.264
(both laugh)

26:11.264 --> 26:12.226
- Coming up.

26:12.226 --> 26:14.066
- Thanks.
(Brenda chuckles)

26:14.066 --> 26:17.536
(lighthearted music)

26:17.536 --> 26:18.369
- All right.

26:18.369 --> 26:19.533
You in for a treat.

26:19.533 --> 26:20.366
- We'll see.

26:20.366 --> 26:22.043
- Tell me what you think
and no holding back.

26:22.043 --> 26:23.554
- Well I will but

26:23.554 --> 26:24.984
mostly by the looks of
it I can already tell

26:24.984 --> 26:25.834
that it's a little
(exclaims)

26:25.834 --> 26:27.347
(Nash laughs)
but I'll try it.

26:27.347 --> 26:28.610
(both laugh)

26:28.610 --> 26:29.773
(Brenda mumbles)

26:29.773 --> 26:31.560
now are you sure you don't
want to introduce you?

26:31.560 --> 26:33.927
- I'm quite sure please stop swiping.

26:33.927 --> 26:34.767
Matter of fact no swiping
at the dinner table.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.057
- But she's cute look

26:37.057 --> 26:39.203
and she's a lawyer.

26:39.203 --> 26:40.036
- Okay.

26:40.036 --> 26:41.223
She's a very pretty lady.

26:41.223 --> 26:44.057
I mean and good for her being a lawyer

26:44.057 --> 26:47.644
but I don't need a girlfriend,
a fiance or wife right now.

26:47.644 --> 26:50.292
I am very fine in my
life being the way it is.

26:50.292 --> 26:51.687
- What's that supposed to mean?

26:51.687 --> 26:52.743
You said it like you out there

26:52.743 --> 26:53.780
driving a Porsche or something.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.728
- I don't need a lawyer
to get me out of trouble.

26:55.728 --> 26:57.124
I've got my nice little coop

26:57.124 --> 26:59.897
to whip me in and out of any
problems I have, all right?

26:59.897 --> 27:01.952
- Well if you say so

27:01.952 --> 27:03.345
but this one right here

27:03.345 --> 27:05.113
I know for sure she's
going to be taken soon.

27:05.113 --> 27:06.306
That I know.

27:06.306 --> 27:07.215
- I wouldn't doubt it

27:07.215 --> 27:08.965
and whatever gentlemen grabs her,

27:08.965 --> 27:10.431
she's gonna make a lovely wife.

27:10.431 --> 27:11.508
(both laugh)

27:11.508 --> 27:12.341
- You know what?

27:12.341 --> 27:13.468
All right your loss.

27:13.468 --> 27:14.489
(both laugh)

27:14.489 --> 27:15.906
You are too much.

27:17.657 --> 27:20.689
- Besides you know, mom
told me to take care of you.

27:20.689 --> 27:21.522
- Stop playing.

27:21.522 --> 27:22.355
What?

27:22.355 --> 27:23.188
- Yeah I'm taking care of you.

27:23.188 --> 27:24.623
- You really think that
you're taking care of me?

27:24.623 --> 27:25.623
- I take care of you all the time.

27:25.623 --> 27:26.875
- I'm taking care of you.

27:26.875 --> 27:27.708
(Nash laugh)

27:27.708 --> 27:28.541
You took care of me?

27:28.541 --> 27:29.374
What?

27:29.374 --> 27:30.532
Like those idiots at the club, right?

27:30.532 --> 27:31.645
- That was me taking care of you.

27:31.645 --> 27:32.783
(Brenda laughs)
- No.

27:32.783 --> 27:33.874
- Look in my defense,

27:33.874 --> 27:35.461
both those guys were assholes

27:35.461 --> 27:38.327
and what am I supposed to
do as a older brother if

27:38.327 --> 27:41.277
I see two guys hitting on
my sister, grabbing her ass,

27:41.277 --> 27:43.225
moving her around like that,

27:43.225 --> 27:44.389
I took care of it.

27:44.389 --> 27:47.197
- You took care of their hospital bill.

27:47.197 --> 27:48.346
- True.

27:48.346 --> 27:49.465
Which I can write off on my taxes.

27:49.465 --> 27:50.941
(Nash laughs)

27:50.941 --> 27:53.090
- If you say so.

27:53.090 --> 27:56.673
(phone vibrates)
- Oh shit.

27:59.490 --> 28:00.511
- [Brenda] Uh-oh.

28:00.511 --> 28:02.292
No business while I'm visiting.

28:02.292 --> 28:03.125
None.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.719
- Yeah, no, we got company.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.382
- This ain't no CIA dance party.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.763
- No, no, no, it's Mara.

28:09.763 --> 28:11.110
She's one of my new agents.

28:11.110 --> 28:12.502
She's good people though.

28:12.502 --> 28:13.422
- Good people?

28:13.422 --> 28:14.770
So you dating her?

28:14.770 --> 28:16.506
- No, no, no, no not at all.

28:16.506 --> 28:17.409
Come on stop it (mumbles)

28:17.409 --> 28:18.242
- Okay.

28:18.242 --> 28:19.209
- She's new.

28:19.209 --> 28:20.393
We're trying to build a rapport.

28:20.393 --> 28:22.473
Like, you know, I figured we

28:22.473 --> 28:23.707
have her come out, have some drinks,

28:23.707 --> 28:24.605
hang out with us for a bit.

28:24.605 --> 28:25.606
- Wait so she's here?

28:25.606 --> 28:26.439
- Yeah.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.272
She's outside.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.355
- Then invite her ass in.

28:32.873 --> 28:35.414
(ominous music)

28:35.414 --> 28:39.289
(Mr. Wan exclaims)
(sword clanks)

28:39.289 --> 28:41.006
(Mr. Wan speaks foreign language)

28:41.006 --> 28:42.203
- Who's the target?

28:42.203 --> 28:44.851
- It's an interesting lead, Billy boy.

28:44.851 --> 28:46.246
There's a woman at this house.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.829
This is her picture

28:49.147 --> 28:50.937
but don't show your real face.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.585
This is the agent place.

28:52.585 --> 28:54.558
This agent, he has been known

28:54.558 --> 28:58.203
to go extra length to solve his problem.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.695
(ominous music)

28:59.695 --> 29:02.597
(drawer clanks)

29:02.597 --> 29:04.245
(masks thud)

29:04.245 --> 29:06.997
- I didn't know Halloween
was approaching so soon.

29:06.997 --> 29:08.993
- I love Halloween.

29:08.993 --> 29:11.247
Just put the goddamn mask.

29:11.247 --> 29:12.080
Go.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.719
Get the fuck out of here.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.093
It's getting late already.

29:15.093 --> 29:17.222
(ominous music continues)

29:17.222 --> 29:18.306
(sword clanks)

29:18.306 --> 29:21.223
(Mr. Wan exclaims)

29:22.221 --> 29:23.054
- Good to see you.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.720
- Oh good to be here.
Thanks for the invite.

29:24.720 --> 29:25.553
- Yeah, no thanks for coming.

29:25.553 --> 29:27.179
- So you're the famous Mara.

29:27.179 --> 29:28.012
- Guilty.

29:28.012 --> 29:29.043
- Yo, yo, (mumbles) be easy, be easy.

29:29.043 --> 29:30.237
(both laugh)

29:30.237 --> 29:31.307
- You must be Brenda.

29:31.307 --> 29:32.467
Nash says you're the best.

29:32.467 --> 29:33.360
- Oh he says that?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.193
- You see.

29:34.193 --> 29:35.026
- I used to hold him down

29:35.026 --> 29:37.029
till he started screaming with laughter.
Just tickling him.

29:37.029 --> 29:38.632
- First of all, I say
good things about you.

29:38.632 --> 29:40.420
Secondly my therapist
said, we don't talk about.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.672
(both laugh)

29:42.672 --> 29:43.960
- In all seriousness though,

29:43.960 --> 29:45.120
I'm glad you came Mara.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.786
- Oh thank you.
- Of course.

29:46.786 --> 29:47.848
I hope you ate before you came though.

29:47.848 --> 29:48.681
(Nash exclaims)
- Come on.

29:48.681 --> 29:49.514
- Because,
- No.

29:49.514 --> 29:51.027
- my brother thinks he's a chef but...

29:51.027 --> 29:52.512
(Brenda exclaims)
(Mara laughs)

29:52.512 --> 29:54.067
- Again, the good stuff is in the oven,

29:54.067 --> 29:55.793
it's almost done.
- Oh.
Okay.

29:55.793 --> 29:56.806
- This is just something
to kind of, you know,

29:56.806 --> 29:57.639
get the refuge.

29:57.639 --> 29:58.785
- Of course.
- Thank you.

29:58.785 --> 29:59.618
We drinking?

29:59.618 --> 30:00.451
- Yeah.

30:00.451 --> 30:01.284
See?

30:01.284 --> 30:02.584
A good guest, she brought wine.

30:02.584 --> 30:03.417
Oh we drinking.

30:03.417 --> 30:04.250
We definitely drinking.

30:04.250 --> 30:05.083
We got wine.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.749
We got water.
Purple drink, we got drinks.

30:06.749 --> 30:08.576
- Okay, wait, wait, what is purple drink?

30:08.576 --> 30:10.296
(both laugh)

30:10.296 --> 30:12.486
what'd I miss?
(both mumble)

30:12.486 --> 30:13.576
- Oh lemme play this song.

30:13.576 --> 30:14.409
Okay.

30:14.409 --> 30:15.958
(Nash mumbles)
I got it, I got it.

30:15.958 --> 30:16.791
Remember this song?

30:16.791 --> 30:17.624
- Oh see.

30:17.624 --> 30:19.523
- He used to go crazy to this song

30:19.523 --> 30:20.356
- See, you're not ready for this.

30:20.356 --> 30:24.273
See I won five, five,
five, five, five trophies

30:26.206 --> 30:29.435
from the first grade to
sixth grade, talent shows

30:29.435 --> 30:30.526
off of songs like these.

30:30.526 --> 30:31.880
See they weren't ready for all this.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.798
They weren't ready for all of that.

30:34.798 --> 30:35.756
My back.

30:35.756 --> 30:36.674
- [Brenda] Oh my god.
- [Mara] Oh okay.

30:36.674 --> 30:37.507
- My elbow, elbow.

30:37.507 --> 30:38.340
- Oh okay, well if we're playing

30:38.340 --> 30:39.221
that kind of gig then it's like (exclaims)

30:39.221 --> 30:40.054
- Okay Mara.

30:40.054 --> 30:41.720
- Okay.
- See.
See.

"That wasn't a pumpkin.

31:13.278 --> 31:14.998
"That was an avocado baby."

31:14.998 --> 31:17.148
I was like, "What the
hell is he on about?"

31:17.148 --> 31:20.081
(Mara laughs)
- [Nash] That was the biggest avocado baby

31:20.081 --> 31:21.369
I've ever seen in my life.

31:21.369 --> 31:22.670
- It was not an avocado.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.305
(both laugh)

31:24.305 --> 31:26.278
- Sounds like you were well taken care of.

31:26.278 --> 31:27.562
- [Brenda] Yeah until dad passed.

31:27.562 --> 31:30.093
I mean it was rough mom but

31:30.093 --> 31:32.450
she raised us all in her effort right?

31:32.450 --> 31:33.368
- She did a great job.

31:33.368 --> 31:34.437
She taught me a lot.

31:34.437 --> 31:36.466
She taught me how to pay attention.

31:36.466 --> 31:37.920
- You can say that again.

31:37.920 --> 31:41.051
(ominous music)

31:41.051 --> 31:42.330
- But what about you honey?

31:42.330 --> 31:45.615
- I was recruited actually but...

31:45.615 --> 31:48.392
(ominous music continues)

31:48.392 --> 31:51.445
- You seem so pretty and proper.

31:51.445 --> 31:53.906
Nash did tell me though you
were excellent in combat.

31:53.906 --> 31:55.898
I could not deal with all of that fight.

31:55.898 --> 31:58.242
- I was always a bit
of a tomboy, I'm sorry.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.842
Nash you burning tomorrow
night's dinner too?

32:00.842 --> 32:01.675
(all coughing)

32:01.675 --> 32:02.640
- [Nash] That's not smoke.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.605
That's gas.

32:03.605 --> 32:04.938
(Nash coughing)

32:04.938 --> 32:06.533
Intruders.

32:06.533 --> 32:07.904
(man exclaims)

32:07.904 --> 32:08.910
(body thuds)

32:08.910 --> 32:11.120
(knife clanks)

32:11.120 --> 32:12.600
(body thuds)

32:12.600 --> 32:15.909
(ominous music)

32:15.909 --> 32:18.409
(Nash coughs)

32:19.426 --> 32:21.341
(body thuds)

32:21.341 --> 32:23.152
(man mumbles)

32:23.152 --> 32:26.922
- and (mumbles) worried about you.

32:26.922 --> 32:30.422
(ominous music continues)

32:44.816 --> 32:47.316
(Nash groans)

32:50.216 --> 32:51.049
- Mara.

32:54.850 --> 32:56.277
Wake up.

32:56.277 --> 32:57.110
Wake up.

33:09.882 --> 33:11.322
Brenda.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.754
Brenda!

33:12.754 --> 33:15.239
(door slams)

33:15.239 --> 33:18.185
(phone vibrates)

33:18.185 --> 33:19.220
- Winston.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.320
- [Winston] Nash, how are you buddy?

33:21.320 --> 33:24.143
- Yeah they, they came and took my sister.

33:24.143 --> 33:26.324
- [Winston] Did they tell
you what they wanted?

33:26.324 --> 33:27.426
- What?

33:27.426 --> 33:28.259
No.

33:28.259 --> 33:29.092
They gassed my place,

33:29.092 --> 33:30.820
it happened so fast I
don't know what happened.

33:30.820 --> 33:31.727
- [Winston] What do you think you did

33:31.727 --> 33:34.815
that would make someone
wanna take your sister?

33:34.815 --> 33:37.031
Any ideas about that old buddy?

33:37.031 --> 33:38.820
- Are you tryna be funny?

33:38.820 --> 33:40.965
- Oh, we had a debrief this morning.

33:40.965 --> 33:42.895
Neither you or Mara were present.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.636
We checked around no
one heard shit from you.

33:45.636 --> 33:47.061
Thought you might have taken my advice

33:47.061 --> 33:50.268
and gotten the hell out of Dodge.

33:50.268 --> 33:51.752
- No.

33:51.752 --> 33:53.682
What is, what's happening to me?

33:53.682 --> 33:56.143
- [Winston] Must be Iraq
is catching up with you.

33:56.143 --> 33:58.726
(somber music)

34:05.243 --> 34:06.076
(glass clanks)

34:06.076 --> 34:07.596
(door knocks)

34:07.596 --> 34:08.898
- Who is it?

34:08.898 --> 34:09.898
- Mr. Smoke.

34:10.911 --> 34:13.578
(Mr. Wan sighs)

34:14.522 --> 34:16.890
(gun cocks)

34:16.890 --> 34:18.831
(gun thuds softly)

34:18.831 --> 34:20.980
- Come in Mr. Smoke.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.188
You are late.

34:22.188 --> 34:26.445
(ominous music)
(door clicks)

34:26.445 --> 34:27.861
(door clicks)

34:27.861 --> 34:29.914
- Well, we happy?

34:29.914 --> 34:31.551
- Indeed.

34:31.551 --> 34:33.178
We got the girl.

34:33.178 --> 34:35.912
Ancy's in route to the warehouse.

34:35.912 --> 34:37.898
- What about the XZ-9?

34:37.898 --> 34:40.847
- The mother load, Mr. Smoke?

34:40.847 --> 34:41.847
Due in time.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.240
Our partner get the first dib.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.066
(ice rattles)

34:50.066 --> 34:52.191
My warrior prepare

34:52.191 --> 34:53.441
for the battle.

35:00.503 --> 35:01.425
(Winston exclaims)

35:01.425 --> 35:02.900
(Winston panting)

35:02.900 --> 35:04.279
- Now drink.

35:04.279 --> 35:05.112
- Oh no, no.

35:05.112 --> 35:06.362
- Take a drink.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.303
You and your so-called agent,

35:10.303 --> 35:12.740
if anything happen to me

35:12.740 --> 35:15.116
my warrior will (mumbles)

35:15.116 --> 35:17.934
(mumbles) prone to hell

35:17.934 --> 35:19.743
and suck your blood dry.

35:19.743 --> 35:20.576
- No.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.530
- You hear me?

35:21.530 --> 35:22.423
- Yes, yes.

35:22.423 --> 35:23.383
- Do you hear me?

35:23.383 --> 35:24.216
- Yes.

35:26.335 --> 35:27.168
Yes.

35:31.850 --> 35:34.433
(glass clanks)

35:35.272 --> 35:37.852
- You are trouble.
(Winston panting)

35:37.852 --> 35:38.685
- Nash.

35:40.935 --> 35:43.476
That bitch's brother.

35:43.476 --> 35:46.476
We need him to take a long vacation.

35:48.108 --> 35:49.503
- I see.

35:49.503 --> 35:51.086
A private vacation.

35:52.927 --> 35:55.213
- There's this dive bar he likes to go.

35:55.213 --> 35:57.938
The Peak Oyster (mumbles)

35:57.938 --> 35:59.334
You take him there

35:59.334 --> 36:01.191
but before you finish him off

36:01.191 --> 36:03.157
interrogate his ass.

36:03.157 --> 36:05.324
There's a code phrase that

36:07.535 --> 36:10.519
was passed to him from his ex partner.

36:10.519 --> 36:12.722
It's a value to us.

36:12.722 --> 36:15.871
- You want me to do your dirty work?

36:15.871 --> 36:18.287
Classic CIA maneuver.

36:18.287 --> 36:19.924
- The pay will be double.

36:19.924 --> 36:21.247
How's that for a maneuver?

36:21.247 --> 36:23.247
- As you wish Mr. Smoke.

36:26.298 --> 36:29.130
(Winston chuckles)

36:29.130 --> 36:30.549
(Winston coughs)

36:30.549 --> 36:31.858
Oh God damn.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.948
You drink this shit you'll die.

36:33.948 --> 36:35.865
- Everything will kill.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.613
Everything

36:38.964 --> 36:40.797
on this ratchet earth.

36:41.762 --> 36:44.069
- I'll set up Nash, okay?

36:44.069 --> 36:46.069
I'll set him up Mr. Wan.

36:47.010 --> 36:48.007
- You better.

36:48.007 --> 36:49.674
- Just take him out.

36:50.586 --> 36:51.631
(door clicks)

36:51.631 --> 36:54.298
(ominous music)

36:55.439 --> 36:58.189
(birds chirping)

37:00.836 --> 37:03.669
(keyboard clicks)

37:12.956 --> 37:13.914
- [Mara] See I can place that

37:13.914 --> 37:16.413
there were active cell signals
in the area last night but

37:16.413 --> 37:20.316
in this neighborhood it's
like a complete blackout.

37:20.316 --> 37:21.871
- What about the cameras?

37:21.871 --> 37:23.390
- The only one clear enough to make out

37:23.390 --> 37:25.388
is the intersection down the street.

37:25.388 --> 37:26.876
Black sedan, two females.

37:26.876 --> 37:27.709
- Yeah.

37:27.709 --> 37:28.836
It had to be two females.

37:28.836 --> 37:30.252
I mean I gotta get my head cleared out

37:30.252 --> 37:31.636
but I at least remember seeing that.

37:31.636 --> 37:33.481
- This was intentional but no demands yet.

37:33.481 --> 37:35.316
- Not a damn thing?

37:35.316 --> 37:36.149
- Nothing.

37:39.401 --> 37:40.401
They'll be in touch.

37:40.401 --> 37:43.233
If they call your cell we
can ping almost immediately.

37:43.233 --> 37:44.969
How do you wanna proceed?

37:44.969 --> 37:45.802
(Nash sighs)

37:45.802 --> 37:47.639
- I need some time.

37:47.639 --> 37:50.065
Gonna meditate on it, I'll be in touch.

37:50.065 --> 37:51.315
- I understand.

37:53.690 --> 37:54.806
Don't worry Nash.

37:54.806 --> 37:55.807
I already filed the report

37:55.807 --> 37:58.116
and I'll brief Winston and Dexter on it.

37:58.116 --> 37:59.009
You'll come in later.

37:59.009 --> 38:00.031
- I really appreciate everything.

38:00.031 --> 38:01.876
You are,
- Of course.

38:01.876 --> 38:04.849
- really sweet and pure and

38:04.849 --> 38:06.788
I do not wanna get you
to wrapped up into this.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.121
- It'll be okay.

38:09.367 --> 38:11.349
- You are quickly becoming
my new best friend.

38:11.349 --> 38:13.766
(Nash laugh)

38:16.361 --> 38:19.848
- We could be more than friends.

38:19.848 --> 38:22.412
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.

38:22.412 --> 38:25.412
Mara I just can't do that right now.

38:26.443 --> 38:27.693
You are amazing

38:29.784 --> 38:32.515
but right now I need to keep my head clear

38:32.515 --> 38:35.015
and you would be a distraction

38:36.693 --> 38:39.779
but I thank you for everything.

38:39.779 --> 38:42.243
(somber music)

38:42.243 --> 38:43.076
Come here.

38:45.597 --> 38:48.097
(Nash kisses)

38:52.493 --> 38:54.410
- Sylvia, it's me Nash.

38:56.848 --> 38:58.923
I really need to talk.

38:58.923 --> 38:59.983
Face to face though.

38:59.983 --> 39:02.420
Can you come to my place?

39:02.420 --> 39:04.670
It's 3324 East River drive.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.084
I just need to talk to you.

39:10.084 --> 39:11.543
So please come.

39:53.284 --> 39:56.436
Why couldn't we talk over the phone?

39:56.436 --> 39:58.132
- To be honest I know you're
working on a bunch of missions

39:58.132 --> 39:59.735
I'm not supposed to know about

39:59.735 --> 40:01.475
but a couple of operatives
came in my place

40:01.475 --> 40:02.693
and took my sister.

40:02.693 --> 40:03.526
- Your sister?

40:03.526 --> 40:04.359
- Yes.

40:04.359 --> 40:05.776
This is personal.

40:06.770 --> 40:08.150
So please,

40:08.150 --> 40:12.331
I need to know what intel
you know about XZ-9.

40:12.331 --> 40:14.831
- What's the password to Play?

40:16.199 --> 40:20.366
- "The wind dances where it
wants not where we will it."

40:20.366 --> 40:22.154
- That is the code.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.586
I got intel that the Wans are

40:24.586 --> 40:27.220
moving a large shipment of XZ-9

40:27.220 --> 40:30.631
via freight to Singapore
and then to China.

40:30.631 --> 40:31.740
- Where they now?

40:31.740 --> 40:33.108
- If it's the Wans you want

40:33.108 --> 40:36.116
they run coke out of The Pink Oyster.

40:36.116 --> 40:39.356
- Yeah they came back to me at my club.

40:39.356 --> 40:42.154
- I would say go to The
Oyster but be careful.

40:42.154 --> 40:43.698
- Yeah.

40:43.698 --> 40:44.743
Yeah.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.087
They never wanted my sister.

40:47.087 --> 40:49.050
- They'll come after you too.

40:49.050 --> 40:50.444
- I know

40:50.444 --> 40:53.361
but not if I come after them first.

40:54.924 --> 40:55.757

- What can't be?

42:12.383 --> 42:13.986
I didn't know you work this late.

42:13.986 --> 42:16.215
- I'm on the XZ-9 operation.

42:16.215 --> 42:17.735
- I thought Winston took you off of that.

42:17.735 --> 42:19.106
- Not since last night.

42:19.106 --> 42:21.939
We were hit, possibly compromised.

42:22.775 --> 42:24.063
- Well it sounds like you
should do the right thing

42:24.063 --> 42:25.980
and stay off the field.

42:27.988 --> 42:30.751
- I was just wrapping up.

42:30.751 --> 42:32.178
What are you doing here?

42:32.178 --> 42:34.002
- Well I was hoping to
speak with Nash but-

42:34.002 --> 42:36.214
- He's the man of the hour.
- Indeed he is.

42:41.194 --> 42:43.076
- Actually I was going to tell you,

42:43.076 --> 42:44.606
I think after this case,

42:44.606 --> 42:47.871
I will be taking those vacation hours.

42:47.871 --> 42:49.159
- Oh well you've earned 'em.

42:49.159 --> 42:51.018
I'm sure Winston wouldn't mind.

42:51.018 --> 42:54.327
- I mean XZ-9 has everyone
on edge, you don't feel that?

42:54.327 --> 42:55.743
- No.

42:55.743 --> 42:57.495
Everything's just fine.

42:57.495 --> 42:59.132
Always been.

42:59.132 --> 43:00.618
Why do you ask?

43:00.618 --> 43:03.556
- No reason, you're right.

43:03.556 --> 43:05.159
(ominous music)

43:05.159 --> 43:06.742
- Leave XZ-9 to us.

43:08.024 --> 43:09.313
No more overtime

43:09.313 --> 43:12.218
and you can go back to
your online operations.

43:12.218 --> 43:13.218
We got this.

43:15.477 --> 43:17.381
- Well then, I'll be going.

43:17.381 --> 43:20.372
(footsteps pattering)
(ominous music continues)

43:20.372 --> 43:21.289
- Hey Mara.

43:22.879 --> 43:26.591
If you see Nash can you
tell him to meet me in here?

43:26.591 --> 43:27.708
- Fine.

43:27.708 --> 43:30.375
(ominous music)

43:38.073 --> 43:42.754
- You know, your brother and
I used to be good friends.

43:42.754 --> 43:45.671
In fact he even helped save my life

43:46.700 --> 43:48.642
during the mission.

43:48.642 --> 43:52.142
I took a bullet and they gave him a medal!

43:53.516 --> 43:55.479
(Winston laughs)

43:55.479 --> 43:56.312
Priceless.

44:00.138 --> 44:04.004
They didn't even give me
three months sick leave.

44:04.004 --> 44:04.837
Mr. Wan,

44:06.780 --> 44:09.044
he's giving me enough money

44:09.044 --> 44:10.806
where I can buy my own island.

44:10.806 --> 44:11.956
In fact,

44:11.956 --> 44:15.022
when XZ-9 hits the
streets in three months,

44:15.022 --> 44:17.628
hell, I may even by two.

44:17.628 --> 44:20.887
(Winston chuckles)
(ominous music)

44:20.887 --> 44:23.970
(lighthearted music)

44:25.228 --> 44:26.250
- Casey can I get another one?

44:26.250 --> 44:27.083
- [Casey] Yeap.

44:27.083 --> 44:32.546
- Thanks.
(lighthearted music continues)

44:32.546 --> 44:33.379
- [Casey] There you go.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.079
- Appreciate it.

44:35.079 --> 44:37.579
(eerie music)

45:06.005 --> 45:07.852
- Everyone get the hell out.

45:07.852 --> 45:08.685
- Now.

45:13.681 --> 45:15.225
- The Wan clan.

45:15.225 --> 45:16.257
- Poor boy.

45:16.257 --> 45:19.137
- We will kill your sister next.

45:19.137 --> 45:22.249
- You touch my sister
I'll make sure you
never fucking walk again

45:22.249 --> 45:23.676
and you in this cheap suit,

45:23.676 --> 45:25.637
I make sure they bury you in it.

45:25.637 --> 45:27.220
- You talk too much

45:28.159 --> 45:29.204
but don't worry

45:29.204 --> 45:30.855
maybe your sister will join you in hell.

45:30.855 --> 45:33.196
- How about you go first
and tell me how it is.

45:33.196 --> 45:34.946
- Big boy, big words.

45:36.017 --> 45:38.017
(snaps)

45:39.593 --> 45:40.955
(body thuds)

45:40.955 --> 45:42.182

45:42.182 --> 45:44.599
(body thuds)

45:46.829 --> 45:49.246
(body thuds)

45:52.221 --> 45:53.445
(knife clanks)

45:53.445 --> 45:54.757
(Nash slaps)

45:54.757 --> 45:56.963
(dramatic music)

45:56.963 --> 45:58.176
- [Man] You're dead.

45:58.176 --> 45:59.552
(man exclaims)
(dramatic music)

45:59.552 --> 46:01.969
(body thuds)

46:08.404 --> 46:10.821
(man groans)

46:13.455 --> 46:14.466
(woman pants)

46:14.466 --> 46:15.299
- Kill him.

46:15.299 --> 46:16.132
(knife clanks)

46:16.132 --> 46:17.571
(dramatic music continues)

46:17.571 --> 46:20.321
(sword whooshes)

46:25.075 --> 46:27.658
(sword clanks)

46:34.257 --> 46:37.007
(woman exclaims)

46:39.193 --> 46:40.327
- You okay?

46:40.327 --> 46:41.478
(Nash pants)

46:41.478 --> 46:44.604
- Thanks for showing up on time.

46:44.604 --> 46:46.247
Let's go.

46:46.247 --> 46:47.663
I wanted you to watch.

46:47.663 --> 46:48.847
- What the hell happened?

46:48.847 --> 46:53.847
(dramatic music)
(sirens blaring)

47:05.647 --> 47:07.458
Did you know those people at the bar?

47:07.458 --> 47:09.386
- I sure as hell do now.

47:09.386 --> 47:11.858
I know the Wan clan was running
the pharmaceutical company

47:11.858 --> 47:13.845
that was making exiting XZ-9.

47:13.845 --> 47:15.863
If that's the case, that
means their old boss Wan

47:15.863 --> 47:18.487
is up to the same tricks he was in before.

47:18.487 --> 47:23.354
Do any intel for any labs or
warehouses next to the pier.

47:23.354 --> 47:26.191
Anything pops up I guarantee
you that's where Brenda is.

47:26.191 --> 47:28.086
- And Dexter came around looking for.

47:28.086 --> 47:31.230
- No, I don't trust him or Winston.

47:31.230 --> 47:33.774
- I think it's worse than that.

47:33.774 --> 47:37.348
I think that they're double agents.

47:37.348 --> 47:38.523
- Really?

47:38.523 --> 47:39.356
- Really.

47:40.624 --> 47:43.515
- Tell you what, you drum
up any intel you can,

47:43.515 --> 47:45.776
you let me deal with Winston and Dexter.

47:45.776 --> 47:48.609
(keyboard clicks)

47:49.528 --> 47:51.838
And Mara,
(lighthearted music)

47:51.838 --> 47:53.560
thank you you've been
saving my ass back there.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.339
(Mara chuckles)

47:55.339 --> 47:59.256
- Anytime.
(lighthearted music)

48:07.035 --> 48:12.035
(footsteps pattering)
(eerie music)

48:23.944 --> 48:24.777
- Dexter.

48:25.859 --> 48:28.111
- I was hoping you would show up.

48:28.111 --> 48:29.563
- I'm gonna cut you up.

48:29.563 --> 48:30.816
(gunshot fires)

48:30.816 --> 48:33.233
(body thuds)

48:34.144 --> 48:37.319
(eerie music continues)

48:37.319 --> 48:38.794
(footsteps pattering)

48:38.794 --> 48:41.906
- I can't believe you betrayed the agency.

48:41.906 --> 48:44.727
- Shouldn't dig up memories
of old military murders.

48:44.727 --> 48:46.770
Who knows what kind of
skeletons you'll find there.

48:46.770 --> 48:47.917
(Nash scoffs)

48:47.917 --> 48:50.681
- You must wanna be buried
with the rest of those bodies.

48:50.681 --> 48:53.226
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

48:53.226 --> 48:55.106
- Not as much as me.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.058
(Dexter exclaims)

48:56.058 --> 48:57.635
(dramatic music)

48:57.635 --> 49:00.218
(both exclaim)

49:07.031 --> 49:09.031
(thuds)

49:14.022 --> 49:15.609
(chair rattles)

49:15.609 --> 49:20.609
(thuds)
(dramatic music continues)

49:22.385 --> 49:24.385
(thuds)

49:30.638 --> 49:33.084
(Dexter exclaims)

49:33.084 --> 49:35.084
(thuds)

49:38.660 --> 49:41.410
(bones crushing)

49:45.331 --> 49:47.940
(bones crushing)
(body thuds)

49:47.940 --> 49:52.152
(dramatic music intensifies)

49:52.152 --> 49:54.735
(Nash panting)

49:55.994 --> 49:56.975
- Are you fucking kidding me?

49:56.975 --> 49:59.380
(gunshot fires)

49:59.380 --> 50:02.458
(glass breaks)

50:02.458 --> 50:03.786
Wan sent you?

50:03.786 --> 50:05.191
- [Man] That's right.

50:05.191 --> 50:07.228
Boss Wan sends his regards.

50:07.228 --> 50:08.061
(gunshots fire)

50:08.061 --> 50:09.999
- Tell your boss to go fuck himself.

50:09.999 --> 50:11.076
(gunshots fire)

50:11.076 --> 50:12.352
Tell you what.

50:12.352 --> 50:15.756
You walk away or not, I
will fucking kill you.

50:15.756 --> 50:18.879
- Your death will be my pleasure.

50:18.879 --> 50:21.442
(gunshot fires)
(gun clicks)

50:21.442 --> 50:22.951
- You know what?

50:22.951 --> 50:24.284
I love pleasure.

50:25.271 --> 50:27.058
Bring it bitch.

50:27.058 --> 50:29.210
(dramatic music)

50:29.210 --> 50:30.868
(glass breaks)

50:30.868 --> 50:32.180
(both exclaim)

50:32.180 --> 50:34.714
(dramatic music intensifies)

50:34.714 --> 50:37.131
(body thuds)

50:38.628 --> 50:41.295
(both grunting)

51:13.097 --> 51:15.680
(bottle thuds)

51:19.447 --> 51:23.114
- Did you always wanna
do this kind of work?

51:25.064 --> 51:26.503
- Not really.

51:26.503 --> 51:29.246
My father was in the military.

51:29.246 --> 51:31.531
National guard actually.

51:31.531 --> 51:33.807
Tried warning me about it but you know,

51:33.807 --> 51:37.119
stupid kid I wasn't willing
to really take his advice.

51:37.119 --> 51:38.452
- [Sylvia] Yeah.

51:39.671 --> 51:40.740
(Nash sighs)

51:40.740 --> 51:43.407
- I wish I would listen.

51:43.407 --> 51:44.824
Things I've seen.

51:46.044 --> 51:46.877
Iraq.

51:48.394 --> 51:51.623
You just don't recover
from that, you know.

51:51.623 --> 51:54.420
- What did you wanna do?

51:54.420 --> 51:57.183
- Never got a chance to figure it out.

51:57.183 --> 51:58.016
Pops,

51:59.284 --> 52:01.617
he left when I was about 14.

52:02.663 --> 52:04.663
Everything he showed me,

52:05.636 --> 52:06.469
military,

52:07.423 --> 52:08.256
training,

52:09.978 --> 52:10.811
focusing,

52:12.322 --> 52:15.397
everything geared me towards this life.

52:15.397 --> 52:17.130
(somber music)

52:17.130 --> 52:21.762
To be honest I don't know
what I would do if I left.

52:21.762 --> 52:23.095
- How about you?

52:24.547 --> 52:26.437
- I was a military brat

52:26.437 --> 52:28.612
and my dad was in the CIA.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.279
I was basically raised for this.

52:32.988 --> 52:36.488
I excelled in explosives to say the least.

52:38.410 --> 52:40.743
I really liked blow torches.

52:43.287 --> 52:44.120
Yeah.

52:46.166 --> 52:47.711
- You get burned that way.

52:47.711 --> 52:48.626
- It's all right.

52:48.626 --> 52:50.709
I like playing with fire.

52:58.287 --> 52:59.787
Can you hear that?

53:01.711 --> 53:03.372
- What?

53:03.372 --> 53:04.539
- The silence.

53:07.842 --> 53:09.759
Something's in the air.

53:11.394 --> 53:13.227
It's always present,

53:13.227 --> 53:15.310
always moving us forward.

53:16.178 --> 53:18.845
If we just stopped and listened,

53:20.730 --> 53:23.063
who chose who we really are.

53:24.552 --> 53:26.704
- Now I'm worried about tomorrow.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.899
- [Sylvia] You're not there,

53:28.899 --> 53:31.303
you're here with me.

53:31.303 --> 53:32.997
What are you so worried about?

53:32.997 --> 53:35.639
- I just can't stop thinking
about what happened.

53:35.639 --> 53:37.661
Everything in Iraq.

53:37.661 --> 53:39.828
My team is basically gone.

53:40.842 --> 53:42.850
Hubbard lord knows where.

53:42.850 --> 53:45.194
Winston traded on me.

53:45.194 --> 53:50.194
You're here, I thank you for
that but anything can go wrong

53:50.418 --> 53:53.391
and I saw what happened
last time with XZ-9.

53:53.391 --> 53:55.922
Hundreds of soldiers were killed.

53:55.922 --> 53:59.161
If that gets out into the world it's over.

53:59.161 --> 54:00.706
- Yeah.

54:00.706 --> 54:05.706
Well then I guess you better
get ready to save the world.

54:06.173 --> 54:07.509
- With you?

54:07.509 --> 54:09.009
- Yeah, of course.

54:10.932 --> 54:11.932
- Thank you.

54:13.802 --> 54:15.101
- And Nash,

54:15.101 --> 54:16.445
- Yeah?

54:16.445 --> 54:17.862
- we can do this.

54:18.901 --> 54:21.651
We just, we just have to believe.

54:22.975 --> 54:24.058
I believe it.

54:27.954 --> 54:30.454
(both kisses)

54:38.095 --> 54:40.762
(ominous music)

54:58.930 --> 54:59.799
- Hey.

54:59.799 --> 55:02.047
So, got anymore
information about the XZ-9?

55:02.047 --> 55:05.547
(ominous music continues)

55:06.645 --> 55:08.213
- Yes.

55:08.213 --> 55:10.787
I made copies for Thursday plan for you

55:10.787 --> 55:12.007
- It's all right.

55:12.007 --> 55:13.890
- and then this.

55:13.890 --> 55:16.640
(dramatic music)

55:22.989 --> 55:23.988
- Check this out and I'll

55:23.988 --> 55:26.404
see you back at the briefing
around three o'clock.

55:26.404 --> 55:27.474
- Okay sounds good.

55:27.474 --> 55:28.307
Okay.

55:28.307 --> 55:30.365
(dramatic music continues)

55:30.365 --> 55:33.282
(buttons clicking)

55:35.945 --> 55:37.112
- God damn it.

55:38.301 --> 55:39.544
(phone thuds)

55:39.544 --> 55:42.467
(fire alarm blares)

55:42.467 --> 55:44.392
What the hell is the fire alarm?

55:44.392 --> 55:46.920
(footsteps pattering)

55:46.920 --> 55:47.753
Oh really?

55:48.594 --> 55:50.184
You?

55:50.184 --> 55:52.482
Didn't I take care of you at the bar?

55:52.482 --> 55:54.722
- Guess I couldn't get
enough of your pretty face.

55:54.722 --> 55:55.555
(man exclaims)

55:55.555 --> 55:58.305
(dramatic music)

56:07.140 --> 56:07.973
Want more?

56:09.060 --> 56:10.542
(man exclaims)

56:10.542 --> 56:14.292
(dramatic music intensifies)

56:16.176 --> 56:18.679
(man exclaims)

56:18.679 --> 56:21.096
(body thuds)

56:29.738 --> 56:32.571
(bones crackling)

56:34.522 --> 56:36.253
- You gon' kill me?

56:36.253 --> 56:37.818
Not if I can help it.

56:37.818 --> 56:39.818
(thuds)

56:40.746 --> 56:43.413
(ominous music)

56:49.349 --> 56:52.888
(glass clanks)
(phone rings)

56:52.888 --> 56:55.555
(ominous music)

56:56.466 --> 56:57.728
- What?

56:57.728 --> 56:59.106
Goddamn it.

56:59.106 --> 57:00.973
How could he?

57:00.973 --> 57:04.088
I sent four of you guys
over there to kill him.

57:04.088 --> 57:07.083
Move to the east side
of the warehouse now.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.443
(phone clicks)
(Mr. Wan groans)

57:08.443 --> 57:09.835
Goddamn it.

57:09.835 --> 57:11.241
(gun cocks)

57:11.241 --> 57:13.329
I'm gonna kill Nash.

57:13.329 --> 57:14.304
Kill you.

57:14.304 --> 57:15.270
Kill you.

57:15.270 --> 57:16.163
Kill you.

57:16.163 --> 57:17.683
(Mr. Wan screams)

57:17.683 --> 57:20.433
(dramatic music)

57:29.665 --> 57:30.734
- Baby you okay?

57:30.734 --> 57:33.497
- [Sylvia] I'm worried Nash.

57:33.497 --> 57:36.433
Our last mission together,

57:36.433 --> 57:38.478
you almost died.

57:38.478 --> 57:40.395
I don't wanna lose you.

57:41.462 --> 57:44.677
I thought I would never see you again.

57:44.677 --> 57:47.406
- You're not gonna lose me

57:47.406 --> 57:49.656
and if you close your eyes,

57:50.681 --> 57:52.990
I'll always be there.

57:52.990 --> 57:55.395
- It's the Wan clan though.

57:55.395 --> 57:58.147
What are the chances that
you and I make it out alive?

57:58.147 --> 58:00.105
- Come on baby.

58:00.105 --> 58:01.994
I'm not afraid to die.

58:01.994 --> 58:04.084
I've been on so many missions that

58:04.084 --> 58:08.881
I've come so close to death
I barely feel alive now.

58:08.881 --> 58:12.561
- I know a way to make you feel alive.

58:12.561 --> 58:15.394
It's an ancient tantric technique.

58:16.358 --> 58:18.191
You just have to relax

58:19.563 --> 58:21.966
and let me take control.

58:21.966 --> 58:25.158
- So is this supposed to
prepare us for tomorrow?

58:25.158 --> 58:27.908
- It'll give you strength,

58:27.908 --> 58:29.075
the best kind.

58:32.506 --> 58:35.294
(both kisses)

58:35.294 --> 58:38.377
(lighthearted music)

59:12.281 --> 59:16.198
(lighthearted music continues)

59:48.753 --> 59:49.586
- Thank you for meeting me.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.419
- Yeah.

59:50.419 --> 59:51.319
- What's the word?

59:51.319 --> 59:52.954
- I got all the intel.

59:52.954 --> 59:54.678
It sounds like in four hours,

59:54.678 --> 59:57.323
a shipment of XZ-9 is
coming over at the pier.

59:57.323 --> 1:00:00.934
Wan hired men to escort the shipment.

1:00:00.934 --> 1:00:01.791
- Four hours?

1:00:01.791 --> 1:00:02.624
- [Mara] Mm-hmm.

1:00:02.624 --> 1:00:03.457
- That means Wan's gonna be at the pier

1:00:03.457 --> 1:00:06.626
to make sure that shipment
comes in and it comes in right

1:00:06.626 --> 1:00:08.632
but there'll be law reinforcement

1:00:08.632 --> 1:00:10.394
so we should probably
strike in the next hour.

1:00:10.394 --> 1:00:11.227
- If I call it in

1:00:11.227 --> 1:00:12.834
I might be able to get some
backup from the Bureau.

1:00:12.834 --> 1:00:14.276
- Nah.
(Nash laughs)

1:00:14.276 --> 1:00:16.530
Winston called me and offered me a bribe.

1:00:16.530 --> 1:00:18.770
$100,000 plus my sister so,

1:00:18.770 --> 1:00:20.088
I know he's probably
already got a plan set up

1:00:20.088 --> 1:00:21.760
to make it look like I'm the trader.

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:22.792
- You know this a trap.

1:00:22.792 --> 1:00:24.000
- I know it's a trap,

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.509
but I got a plan.

1:00:25.509 --> 1:00:28.680
What I need from you are the
blueprints of the warehouse.

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:29.690
- Okay.

1:00:29.690 --> 1:00:32.314
(keyboard clicks)

1:00:32.314 --> 1:00:33.485
Think I got 'em.

1:00:33.485 --> 1:00:35.017
Even with the shipment coming in later,

1:00:35.017 --> 1:00:37.330
Wan's gonna have at least
half a dozen men there.

1:00:37.330 --> 1:00:38.861
Who's gonna have your back?

1:00:38.861 --> 1:00:40.230
- She will.

1:00:40.230 --> 1:00:41.980
- I'll have his back.

1:00:43.157 --> 1:00:44.701
- Mara this is Sylvia Crowell.

1:00:44.701 --> 1:00:46.594
She's in my unit Special Ops.

1:00:46.594 --> 1:00:47.640
Sylvia this is Mara,

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.717
she's my partner with the agency.

1:00:49.717 --> 1:00:51.217
She's a lifesaver.

1:00:52.144 --> 1:00:54.894
- I guess we have that in common.

1:00:55.868 --> 1:00:57.124
- Can you trust her?

1:00:57.124 --> 1:01:00.629
- Yeah.
Just like I can trust you.

1:01:00.629 --> 1:01:01.470
- Brought us some gear.

1:01:01.470 --> 1:01:03.608
(bag thuds)

1:01:03.608 --> 1:01:06.996
Now we can go kill
everyone in that warehouse

1:01:06.996 --> 1:01:09.250
and get your sister back.

1:01:09.250 --> 1:01:12.082
I also have this for you.

1:01:12.082 --> 1:01:13.546
- I can't take this.

1:01:13.546 --> 1:01:15.662
If I go in wearing this then
they know something's up.

1:01:15.662 --> 1:01:17.056
(Mara sighs)

1:01:17.056 --> 1:01:20.417
- Well according to the blueprints
there's opening on the
northeast and south side.

1:01:20.417 --> 1:01:21.620
Get you in on the west,

1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:24.894
we can take out anybody
on the other two sides.

1:01:24.894 --> 1:01:27.484
Try and get our offense.

1:01:27.484 --> 1:01:29.836
- That won't work, we can't communicate.

1:01:29.836 --> 1:01:31.234
- I do.

1:01:31.234 --> 1:01:33.295
(zip rattles)

1:01:33.295 --> 1:01:34.212
With these.

1:01:35.434 --> 1:01:38.474
You can track each other's locations,

1:01:38.474 --> 1:01:39.641
our heartbeats

1:01:42.562 --> 1:01:44.081
and we can communicate.

1:01:44.081 --> 1:01:45.871
So let's gear up.

1:01:45.871 --> 1:01:47.367
- [Nash] Good.

1:01:47.367 --> 1:01:50.450
I was hoping you two would get along.

1:01:52.143 --> 1:01:54.893
(dramatic music)

1:01:57.711 --> 1:02:00.128
- [Mr. Wan] Winston, Winston.

1:02:06.012 --> 1:02:08.679
Are you playing with this woman?
