PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

and CBS

01:13.807 --> 01:16.177
( ringing )

01:16.210 --> 01:19.280
No, for the 23rd time.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.350
( ringing )

01:26.920 --> 01:28.756
You going to answer that?

01:28.789 --> 01:30.891
I'm in hell, Kate.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.761
Well, do they have money there?

01:33.794 --> 01:36.897
'Cause you owe me $43.86

01:36.930 --> 01:38.632
for lunch this week.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.134
I will gladly pay you

01:40.168 --> 01:41.435
today

01:41.469 --> 01:42.903
if you'll answer
this call for me.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.172
Yeah? Who is it?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.273
A crazy
ex-girlfriend.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.774
I haven't seen her
since college.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.676
Stalker?

01:48.709 --> 01:49.810
More like a stalk-him.

01:49.843 --> 01:50.811
What do you want
me to say to her?

01:50.844 --> 01:51.912
I don't know.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.581
Tell her you're my wife
or something.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.150
She's been calling me

01:56.184 --> 01:57.818
nonstop for two days.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.420
I'm begging you here,
Kate, please?

01:59.453 --> 02:00.854
You pay me back today.

02:00.888 --> 02:01.855
Sure.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.692
Thank you.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.793
Hello?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.395
WOMAN ( on phone ):
Hello. Who are you?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.863
Me? Oh, uh...

02:09.897 --> 02:11.532
I am Tony's wife.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.400
( on phone ):
Are you serious?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.335
Uh, yes, we got married
a few years ago.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.336
Do you have kids?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.205
Do we have kids?

02:17.238 --> 02:17.838
No.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.508
Two.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.509
You have two kids?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.745
Yes, and we're
very, very happy.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.414
So, please, don't
call back again.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.349
Sorry.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.884
Ugh. I feel like
I need a shower.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.222
( chuckling ):
Pay the lady, probie.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.428
He bet me $40

02:40.461 --> 02:42.896
that he could get you
to say you're his wife today.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.897
Tony,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.466
I'm going to kill you.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.368
GIBBS:
DiNozzo! Pull
the case file

02:47.401 --> 02:49.603
on Lieutenant Brian McAllister.

02:49.637 --> 02:53.241
McAllister? We going after
more treasure hunters, boss?

02:53.407 --> 02:54.675
Treasure hunters?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
Before your time, probie.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.245
McAllister disappeared
two years ago.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.879
His family offered
a million-dollar reward

02:58.912 --> 03:00.614
for anyone
who could find him.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.616
I had a few friends
in the Secret Service

03:02.650 --> 03:04.585
who used to work
that case on the weekends.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.787
It was the Holy Grail
for every amateur detective

03:06.820 --> 03:08.656
on the East Coast, Kate.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.790
So what happened?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.792
Nothing. Cold case.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.527
Not anymore.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.628
REPORTER:
For the past two years,
thousands have searched

03:14.662 --> 03:16.830
for the heir to the
McAllister Industries fortune.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.466
Each hoping to collect
the $1 million reward

03:18.499 --> 03:19.933
offered by his famous family.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.771
Today, private investigator,
Monroe Cooper,

03:23.804 --> 03:25.739
believes he's one step closer
to solving the mystery.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.641
Mr. Cooper, is it true

03:27.675 --> 03:29.777
that you have finally found
Brian McAllister?

03:31.845 --> 03:34.915
Whoa, boss.
That was Monroe Cooper.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.719
The man who can solve
the unsolvable?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.388
He's a famous detective.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.823
Do I look like I care, McGee?

03:42.856 --> 03:43.957
No.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.862
Grab your gear.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.332
We're going
to Black Lake.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.779
"Lieutenant Brian McAllister
graduated Annapolis

04:05.813 --> 04:08.649
"in '97,
third in his class.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.952
"He vanished somewhere between
October 4 and the 7th, 2002.

04:11.985 --> 04:12.886
No leads."

04:12.920 --> 04:14.755
Thing I don't get is
why a guy worth millions

04:14.788 --> 04:16.089
would join the military
in the first place.

04:16.123 --> 04:20.561
You think money
has anything to do
with patriotism, DiNozzo?

04:20.594 --> 04:23.297
No, I'm just saying
if I were rich, you know,

04:23.331 --> 04:24.498
I would do nothing.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.866
I thought your
parents were loaded.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.768
They are.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.837
So why do you work for
the government then?

04:29.870 --> 04:33.507
Because they know what their
son would do with the money.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.509
I can't even get
an advance on the will, Kate.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.345
Hey, McGee!

04:37.378 --> 04:38.946
Yeah, boss?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.515
Tell me about that
private dick, Cooper.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.617
Yeah, uh, he's
a former NYPD detective,

04:43.651 --> 04:46.987
works mostly for insurance
companies and celebrities now.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.056
He makes a lot of money
solving cases like this.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.491
The guy's a...

04:50.524 --> 04:52.025
He's kind of a cross
between Columbo

04:52.059 --> 04:53.361
and Sherlock Holmes.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.528
( crash )

04:58.599 --> 04:59.800
You know, we really should

04:59.833 --> 05:01.034
get a seat belt back there.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.571
Hey!

05:03.604 --> 05:04.938
What the hell
are you doing?!

05:04.972 --> 05:06.740
Looking for my fork.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.676
Well, I can guarantee you

05:08.709 --> 05:09.710
( groans )
it is not there.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.449
( reporter speaking
indistinctly )

05:20.053 --> 05:24.458
Tony, grab the gear
and see if McGee's still alive.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.965
Special Agent Gibbs,
Todd, NCIS.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.368
Been waiting for
you all to show up.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.736
Sheriff Deke Lester.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.738
That Detective fella,
Cooper, he thinks

05:37.771 --> 05:39.873
that missing McAllister
kid's in there somewhere.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.974
Yeah?

05:41.008 --> 05:41.975
Is he?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.644
I can't say,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.513
but my divers found
a Chrysler convertible

05:45.546 --> 05:46.647
sitting on the bottom.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.916
Lieutenant McAllister
owned a Chrysler convertible.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.418
It disappeared
with him, Gibbs.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.852
Fixing to
pull it out.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.020
Once we I.D. the vehicle,

05:53.053 --> 05:54.455
we can decide on
who's got jurisdiction.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.957
Works for me,
Sheriff.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.025
Where's Cooper?

05:58.058 --> 05:58.959
I don't rightly know.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.696
I imagine he's off
detecting or something.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.566
( over radio ):
Hey, Deke, we've got
the chains set here.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.834
Let's haul her up.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.868
Yes, sir.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.102
You ready to see what
we caught, Agent Gibbs?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.740
TONY:
Hurry it up, probie.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.908
McGEE:
You sure this
is necessary?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.677
I kind of feel
like a dork.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.078
You are a dork.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.014
No, no, no. Bad move.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.015
What?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.417
Gibbs catches you reading

06:23.451 --> 06:25.018
instead of working,
you're history.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.019
It's not for reading.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.888
I'm hoping I can get
Detective Cooper to sign it.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.922
The lead character
in the book

06:28.956 --> 06:29.723
is based on him.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.426
Celebrity P.I.?
Never heard of it.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.995
No.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.732
I'm not surprised
you haven't heard of it.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.468
There's no pictures in it.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.169
You say something, probie?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.605
Yeah. I'm not a dork.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.575
( waders squeaking )

06:50.878 --> 06:53.481
Whatever you say, SpongeBob.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.053
Take it slow now, Charlie!

07:07.628 --> 07:09.029
TONY:
I think it's safe to say

07:09.062 --> 07:11.031
that car's not
gonna run again.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.605
LESTER:
All right, hold it right there.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.973
All right, Kate.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.847
( camera shutter clicks )

07:26.880 --> 07:28.949
The lieutenant's tags, Gibbs.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.551
Congratulations.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.952
Looks like you found
your missing sailor.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.020
Eh, not yet.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.661
I think you'll find that
pile of bones is McAllister,
Special Agent, uh...

07:40.694 --> 07:42.262
Gibbs.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.998
And I'll wait for my M.E.
to determine that.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.034
Oh, of course.

07:47.067 --> 07:47.868
Monroe Cooper.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.739
"The man who
solves the unsolvable."

07:51.772 --> 07:52.806
So you've heard of me?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.275
No. It's on your card.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.011
My publicist's idea.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.613
Works great
with the yokels.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.114
( camera shutter clicking )

08:01.148 --> 08:03.016
How'd you track
his vehicle to Black Lake?

08:03.050 --> 08:06.119
Leg work, luck, my gut.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.789
It say that on
your card, too?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
I have a policy,
Agent Gibbs.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.894
You share
information with me,

08:13.927 --> 08:15.162
and I share it with you.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.163
We have a deal?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.298
That kind of goes
against my policy, Cooper.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.366
Which is?

08:19.399 --> 08:23.671
Throw people in jail who
obstruct my investigations.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.773
Uh-huh.

08:25.806 --> 08:29.009
I'll try to
keep that in mind.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.311
DUCKY:
The dental records
are conclusive, Jethro.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.146
This is our
missing lieutenant.

08:33.180 --> 08:33.847
Any idea how he died?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.315
After two years
in the water?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.817
Difficult to say.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.151
Do you suspect foul play?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.654
You know me, Duck.
I suspect everything.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.290
That's an admirable trait
in an investigator.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.893
And also the reason your three
marriages ended in divorce.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.094
Oh yeah?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.797
All these years I thought
it was because I was a bastard.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.031
Well, of course,
that didn't help.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.666
( wry laugh )

08:52.700 --> 08:55.769
Oh, there's evidence
of a hairline fracture

08:55.803 --> 08:58.338
on the frontal lobe
of the skull.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.272
Cause?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.909
It's consistent with
most vehicle accidents,

09:01.942 --> 09:05.212
quite possibly from contact
with the steering column.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.647
What about drugs?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.216
Well, in this state,
a toxicological screen

09:09.249 --> 09:09.950
would be useless.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.253
However,
drugs are a possibility.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.589
Too many of those, Duck;
too many.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.824
Well, my current opinion

09:16.857 --> 09:20.260
is that Lieutenant McAllister
met with a tragic accident.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.630
Most likely, he drowned.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.099
Keep looking.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.104
Alas, poor Yorick.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.206
Did you meet
any of his wives?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.042
I introduced him
to the last one.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.777
Really.
What went wrong?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.245
Oh, t's difficult to say,
Mr. Palmer.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.014
She doesn't talk
to me anymore.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.886
( camera shutter clicking )

09:48.088 --> 09:49.890
You know what movie
this reminds me of, Kate?

09:51.859 --> 09:52.993
The Wizard of Oz?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.928
( imitating witch ):
I'll get you, my pretty!

09:54.962 --> 09:57.230
No. I meant the one they
make you watch in high school.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.832
30 minutes of cops

09:58.866 --> 10:00.668
pulling dead teenagers
out of car wrecks.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.870
Oh, my God!

10:02.903 --> 10:03.971
I loved those!

10:04.004 --> 10:05.172
Blood on the Highway...

10:05.205 --> 10:06.774
Drink, Drive, Die.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.241
I keep hoping they're
gonna release them on DVD.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.910
Yeah, me too.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.878
Yeah.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.313
What do we have?

10:13.346 --> 10:14.982
Ah, hey, boss.
I found a suitcase in the back.

10:15.015 --> 10:15.883
Looks like he packed enough

10:15.916 --> 10:17.985
for about a weekend.
Dive team will be back

10:18.018 --> 10:19.887
with the rest of the stuff
from the debris field

10:19.920 --> 10:20.921
in a few hours.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.155
Abbs?

10:22.189 --> 10:23.256
The brake lines

10:23.290 --> 10:25.793
are corroded
but they're intact.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.695
Something's stuck.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.967
Hey, Kate?

10:34.001 --> 10:36.003
I got a present for ya.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.338
I think it's one
of your ex-boyfriends.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.273
( camera shutter clicking )

10:40.307 --> 10:41.975
It's a cold fish.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.977
You get it, Kate?

10:45.012 --> 10:46.346
I don't think
this was an accident!

10:55.255 --> 10:57.891
It's a bullet.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.226
McAllister was murdered.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.238
( rock music blaring )

11:11.271 --> 11:13.240
( groans )

11:14.474 --> 11:15.175
( music stops )

11:15.809 --> 11:17.077
Your speakers are broken.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.145
Oh, Gibbs.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.313
That was the best part
of the song.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.850
Correction,
your ears are broken.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.451
What'd the divers find?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.453
Actually, it's more like

11:26.486 --> 11:28.922
what didn't
they find.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.257
My theory is they're

11:30.290 --> 11:31.959
getting paid by the piece.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.761
They recovered
everything

11:33.794 --> 11:35.829
within a 20-meter
radius of the vehicle.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.999
Sunglasses, golf balls,
Rick James 8-track,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.001
typewriter...
I didn't see any point

11:41.034 --> 11:43.036
in bringing the Maytag up
from the evidence lock-up.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.005
Anything to do with the case?

11:45.038 --> 11:45.873
As a matter of fact,

11:45.906 --> 11:46.406
found directly
beneath the vehicle...

11:46.439 --> 11:48.508
Can you hear me now?

11:48.541 --> 11:52.312
I might be able to recover some
data from the memory chip.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.246
What about
the bullet

11:53.280 --> 11:55.148
we brought up from
the wreck last night?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.884
45 caliber.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.518
230-grain hardball.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.088
Lots and lots of stopping power.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.924
ABBY:
The grooving matches

12:03.957 --> 12:05.859
a Colt .45, old-school
military version.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.460
Did you work up
a trajectory yet?

12:07.494 --> 12:08.796
Of course.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.500
The bullet's entry angle
into the side of the door

12:13.533 --> 12:16.236
is as obvious as
Anna Nicole's implants.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.038
Who?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.940
You know,
married to that old guy,

12:19.973 --> 12:21.541
had a TV show,
got fat,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.210
got thin, got fat,
got thin, fat....

12:23.243 --> 12:24.044
Stop

12:24.077 --> 12:25.045
Right, so...

12:25.078 --> 12:29.016
using that angle,
I back-traced the trajectory.

12:29.049 --> 12:32.219
The bullet traveled
on this path.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.488
So unless he was driving with
his feet from the backseat,

12:35.522 --> 12:37.791
which is something that I have
tried, but do not recommend...

12:37.825 --> 12:38.959
Abby.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.495
...the round had to
have gone through

12:42.529 --> 12:43.496
McAllister's body.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.104
It's entirely
possible, Jethro,

12:51.138 --> 12:53.807
but if Abby's
animation is correct,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.909
the bullet passed
clean through

12:55.943 --> 12:57.477
the thoracic cavity--
unfortunately,

12:57.510 --> 12:59.880
without leaving any
evidence of its passing.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.482
Hell of a shot.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.483
Yeah.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.018
The vehicle had
to be going

13:05.052 --> 13:07.487
over 70 to end up where
we found it in the lake.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.489
Well, at that speed,

13:09.522 --> 13:10.557
a bullet
passing through the rib cage

13:10.590 --> 13:14.361
without so much as glancing
a single bone... ha!

13:14.394 --> 13:16.163
Hell of a shot indeed.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.497
More like impossible.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.300
Thank you, Duck.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.570
Doctor?

13:23.603 --> 13:26.473
He means the vehicle
was stationary

13:26.506 --> 13:29.910
when Lieutenant McAllister
was shot,

13:29.943 --> 13:32.279
Mr. Palmer.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.548
KATE:
Lieutenant McAllister was last
seen in Norfolk on a Friday,

13:35.582 --> 13:38.085
then found 300 miles away
in Black Lake, Virginia.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.487
Which would make sense
if he was heading here.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.223
The McAllister family compound
in Shenandoah.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.125
So he was heading home
for the weekend?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.394
Another 20 miles and he
would have made it, McGee.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.395
DiNozzo.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.063
McAllister's
military records

13:50.097 --> 13:50.898
are spotless, boss.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.432
Been running background
on his family.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.467
Mother died in '93.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.336
Father passed away in 2002,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.638
three months after
the lieutenant disappeared.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.242
The only surviving
next of kin is this guy:

14:02.275 --> 14:04.477
Thomas McAllister,
his younger brother.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.947
Washed out of Annapolis
freshman year.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.581
Arrested a bunch of
times for suspected

14:08.615 --> 14:10.417
DWI and marijuana
possession.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.418
Never convicted.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.653
Figures.
The rich never are.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.155
Even richer now, Kate.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.957
He inherited everything.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.126
He's currently the CEO
of his own airline.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.261
The Good Son
and the Bad Seed.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.529
Very biblical.

14:22.562 --> 14:26.366
TONY:
Navy notified him
last night about
his brother.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.168
CACO said
he took it pretty well.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.169
Lunch.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.171
Oh! Thank you.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.539
Mm-hmm.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.042
I took the liberty
of ordering lunch today.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.044
Something healthy, for once.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.179
There you are.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.148
They're tofu veggie wraps.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.950
( sniffs )
They're good, Tony.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.252
Abby and I
eat them all the time.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.120
DiNozzo,
track down the bad seed.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.156
I want to know what he was doing

14:49.189 --> 14:50.991
around the time
his brother disappeared.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.559
Already set up an interview for
later this afternoon, boss.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.027
Take Kate.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.095
McGee.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.029
Contact Cooper.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.065
I want to know how he
found that vehicle.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.466
So we're going
to cooperate with him?

14:59.499 --> 15:00.934
No, McGee,

15:00.968 --> 15:03.436
he's going to cooperate with me.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.205
Okay, I'll be right back,
I'm just going

15:05.238 --> 15:06.974
to run this down to Abby.
Enjoy.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.212
( sniffs )

15:25.758 --> 15:27.094
( Kate chuckles )

15:27.127 --> 15:29.662
"Beyond First Class"?!

15:29.696 --> 15:31.198
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.333
Might as well call it
Rich Jackass Airways.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.601
I think
it sounds cool.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.103
You would.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.137
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.039
Nothing, Rockefeller.
Oh, I get it.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.041
So because I grew
up with money,

15:41.074 --> 15:42.609
that somehow
makes me bad.
Very deep.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.277
Well, it's better than
having to work every day,

15:44.311 --> 15:45.678
like I had to.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.114
Listen, you think money
makes life easier, huh?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.748
Everything was just
a big old cakewalk

15:48.781 --> 15:50.283
for little
Anthony DiNozzo?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.719
You tell me, Kate, 'cause
I really want to know.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.088
I'm sorry, Tony.
I didn't mean anything by it.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.357
'Cause you want to know
the answer to your question?

15:57.390 --> 16:00.493
Yes, money makes
a huge difference, huge.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.762
I miss it every
single day of my life,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.032
so much it makes
me want to cry.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.166
You're pathetic.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.367
It's part of my charm.
Yeah.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.501
TONY:
All right, let's find

16:08.535 --> 16:11.304
this little twiddle toes
candy pants.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.140
Hey, there, we're
looking for your boss,

16:13.173 --> 16:15.208
Thomas McAllister--
is he around?

16:15.242 --> 16:16.576
You'll have to hold on
a second.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.512
Could you pass me that

16:19.546 --> 16:21.614
socket wrench
please, miss?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.552
KATE:
Is he even here

16:25.585 --> 16:29.122
or should we stop by a country
club or something?

16:29.156 --> 16:30.623
I'm Tom McAllister.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.362
Agents Todd,
DiNozzo, NCIS.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.664
Do you always work on your
own planes, Mr. McAllister?

16:37.697 --> 16:40.300
Whenever I can find time
in my busy social schedule

16:40.333 --> 16:42.035
down at the club,
Agent Todd.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.203
I'm sorry about that.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.271
I didn't...
It's fine.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.473
You would have been right
a couple of years ago.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.708
And please, call me Tom.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.477
Kate.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.545
So, do you own all these planes?

16:52.579 --> 16:56.416
Yeah, me and the bank.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.650
That's my new
one out there.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.319
Plan on taking it

16:59.352 --> 17:01.488
for a test flight today,
if you're interested.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.156
TONY:
You don't seem too broken up

17:03.190 --> 17:05.358
for a guy who just
lost his brother, Tom.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.361
I've known he's been dead
for quite some time,
Agent DiNozzo.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.597
The first week you
expect a ransom note.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.499
After a month,
you pray.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.434
A year?

17:14.467 --> 17:17.237
You just know.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.539
When's the last time
you talked to your brother?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.541
About three months
before the accident.

17:21.574 --> 17:25.078
Would you believe we grew up
fishing at Black Lake?

17:25.112 --> 17:26.579
Thing is, it wasn't
an accident.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.680
But the Navy, they said...

17:27.714 --> 17:29.582
Your brother
was murdered.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.319
Are you absolutely
positive about that?

17:34.554 --> 17:37.790
He was shot on the weekend
of October 4, 2002.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.159
I'm sorry.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.460
Considering his body
was found dumped

17:40.493 --> 17:42.629
20 miles from your house,
we'd like to know where

17:42.662 --> 17:44.764
you were the weekend
he disappeared.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.701
Me... I was at home.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.470
Anyone who can verify that?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.472
I was with
my father.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.573
Let me rephrase.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.843
Is there anyone who can verify
that who's still alive.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.878
No.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.847
You're saying
you think I did it?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.582
We're just
following up

18:02.615 --> 18:04.551
any leads we can, Tom.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.687
Of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.858
I can't tell you what
an honor this is, sir.
Thank you.

18:11.891 --> 18:12.859
Don't believe everything

18:12.892 --> 18:14.261
you read in
the book, kid.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.163
It's called fiction
for a reason.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.331
I actually write
a little myself.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.366
Ah.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.833
Is there any truth to the rumor

18:20.867 --> 18:23.336
that S.E. Eckhart is,
in fact, you?

18:23.370 --> 18:24.837
If I was a best-selling author,
would I be

18:24.871 --> 18:26.139
crawling through
the swamps of Virginia

18:26.173 --> 18:29.476
searching for
reward money?

18:29.509 --> 18:30.477
No, I guess not.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.478
Damn straight.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.679
Now tell me
about your boss.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.514
Is he always
such a hard-ass?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.816
Agent Gibbs?
Yeah.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.285
He's a lot like you,
actually.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.686
Oh...?
Yeah.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.554
In fact, the main character
in my book

18:41.588 --> 18:42.422
is based on him.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.558
I hope he got a better
deal than I got.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.926
Well, he doesn't know it yet.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.261
Don't know what,
McGee?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.830
What a great guy
I am, Gibbs.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.400
You ready to tell me
how you found McAllister?

18:53.433 --> 18:54.667
You ready to tell me
what you pulled

18:54.701 --> 18:55.602
out of his car and his corpse?

18:55.635 --> 18:56.603
Depends.
On what?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.604
How bad you want

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
that million-dollar reward.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.540
Ah... considering
how I don't collect

19:00.573 --> 19:03.176
till you put the
murderer behind bars,

19:03.210 --> 19:05.345
you got me by the short hairs
there, Gibbs.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.413
Here.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.384
I figured the lieutenant
headed home that weekend.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.620
But the back road that
he liked to drive,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.522
I think it was washed out.

19:15.555 --> 19:19.459
Here, take a look at
these weather patterns.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.595
Now, I spent
nine weeks

19:22.629 --> 19:24.364
getting these from the
National Weather Service.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.665
Every Doppler

19:25.698 --> 19:27.200
readout, every
satellite image

19:27.234 --> 19:28.601
I could find.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.803
Pocket of storms, real tight,

19:30.837 --> 19:32.939
near the road.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.741
Enough to swell that creek
alongside?

19:34.774 --> 19:38.211
Yeah, but only on that side
of the mountain, kid.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.446
My educated guess?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.548
I think McAllister doubled back,

19:41.581 --> 19:43.816
took this road
to the other side,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.318
where the storm
hadn't reached yet.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.254
See, the locals

19:47.287 --> 19:49.722
only use that road
when there are bad storms.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.625
That's right along
Black Lake, boss.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.661
I figure that if somebody
wanted to kill him,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.496
they had to know
the roads and the weather

19:56.529 --> 19:57.764
the way McAllister did.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.733
And they'd have to know
he was coming,

20:00.767 --> 20:02.769
am I right?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.604
( elevator bell dings )

20:04.637 --> 20:07.274
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.
What?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.642
Kate Todd acting like a high
school girl with a crush.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.943
He's not
a murderer, Tony.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.712
I'm sorry,
were you using

20:12.745 --> 20:14.581
the new NCIS magical murderer
detector back there?

20:14.614 --> 20:15.648
My gut.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.551
If you were a guy,
I'd say you were using your...

20:18.585 --> 20:20.387
Don't even say it,
if you want to live.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.523
What did Thomas McAllister
have to say?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.359
He hadn't heard from his
brother in three months.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.260
Definitely
hiding something, boss.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.662
KATE:
My best guess,
it was grief.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.963
There's no way
he's involved, Gibbs.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.565
GIBBS:
Abbs, what do you have?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.767
The last three calls

20:34.801 --> 20:36.769
that came in on the phone
from the lake

20:36.803 --> 20:38.605
were all made on
Friday, October 4.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.039
Yeah?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.542
And they were all from
his brother, Thomas McAllister.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.277
Sorry, Kate.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.929
This McAllister
family's got

21:02.962 --> 21:05.898
more skeletons than a
North Korean prison camp, Gibbs.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.767
Here.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.769
That's everything
I've turned up.

21:09.802 --> 21:10.970
Six months
of leg work.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.772
It's okay to smoke

21:12.805 --> 21:14.341
in here, sweetheart?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.543
Uh, it's Agent Todd, and, no,

21:16.576 --> 21:18.745
Detective Cooper.
It's a federal
office building.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.347
Oh. It's a wonder you guys

21:20.380 --> 21:22.715
catch anybody working
under these conditions.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.617
KATE:
We manage.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.786
This supposed to be

21:26.819 --> 21:28.388
in some sort of order?

21:28.421 --> 21:29.689
The order's

21:29.722 --> 21:30.790
up here, Gibbs.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.626
And I'll be glad
to lay it out for you,

21:33.660 --> 21:35.795
once you tell me
what you found in that wreck.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.067
Lieutenant McAllister was shot.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.869
Hmm. How many times?

21:42.902 --> 21:43.970
At least once.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.838
You got the round?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.840
It's recovered
from the passenger-side door.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.676
Oh.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.711
Pistol, uh, huh?

21:51.744 --> 21:53.079
Rifle would go clear through.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.847
Forty-five.

21:54.881 --> 21:55.982
Ah.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.718
Car must have been stopped.

21:58.751 --> 22:02.021
He was approached,
but not alarmed.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.525
Know his attacker?

22:05.558 --> 22:08.995
One shot, point blank.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.531
Blam.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.832
Poor sap never saw it coming.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.035
You know how, Gibbs.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.670
Want to know why?
( elevator bell dings )

22:17.704 --> 22:19.972
( door opening )

22:20.006 --> 22:21.841
Angle your end
down, probie.
I told you

22:21.874 --> 22:23.075
we should have
taken the legs off.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.010
Ow!

22:24.043 --> 22:25.878
Ow!

22:25.912 --> 22:27.780
I said down.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.048
Okay.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.017
What does Cooper need
this thing for anyway?

22:31.050 --> 22:33.085
He's old school.
It's part of his process.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.888
He has solved every case
he's taken on, Tony.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.990
How many detectives
you know with 100%
batting average?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.059
You mean besides Gibbs?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.994
( grunting loudly )

22:43.162 --> 22:45.064
Finally.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.132
Change of plans.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.367
I'm doing this upstairs.

22:54.641 --> 22:55.942
( elevator bell dings )

22:55.975 --> 22:57.777
McGEE:
Maybe we should
take the stairs.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.447
Maybe you should
take the legs off,
like I told you to.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.380
I'm gonna
take the stairs.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.115
Hey, I'm the one
who said that...
Ah, ah!

23:04.717 --> 23:06.986
Elaine McAllister, the mother.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.655
Into the occult in a big way.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.023
Psychics, seances,
all that weird sh...

23:11.991 --> 23:14.561
Stuff. She dies in '93,

23:14.594 --> 23:16.596
family falls apart.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.864
How?

23:17.897 --> 23:18.931
The old man.

23:18.965 --> 23:19.966
Took it pretty hard.

23:19.999 --> 23:20.967
He decided he was gonna

23:21.000 --> 23:23.002
contact the dead wife.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.871
Starts neglecting
the family business.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.939
What do you mean
by make contact?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.708
He consults this
space cadet,

23:28.741 --> 23:29.942
Saleena Lockhart.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.444
Claimed to be a psychic.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.178
I've heard of her.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.580
She used to have that, um...

23:33.613 --> 23:34.947
the tabloid
astrology column.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.015
No, I don't buy it.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.149
Astrology?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.518
No, you reading
tabloids.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.720
She weasels her way
into the old man's life.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.788
Next thing you know,

23:41.821 --> 23:43.022
she's practically
running it.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.725
McAllister Avionics starts
to slide

23:45.758 --> 23:47.126
till it's almost bankrupt
by 2000.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.861
How much money
did he leave her?

23:48.895 --> 23:50.062
You're quick, Gibbs.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.163
Almost ten million.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.699
He changed his will

23:52.732 --> 23:55.101
two weeks after
the lieutenant went missing.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.904
The surviving brother
still fighting it in court.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.606
This is kind
of like Anna Nicole.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.206
Who?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.741
That's what I said.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.245
McGee, run a background
on this wack job.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.981
I want to know where
she is right now.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.149
On it, boss.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.084
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.553
She didn't do it, Gibbs.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.054
This is the smoking gun.

24:15.087 --> 24:18.625
Thomas McAllister had a plan
to save

24:18.658 --> 24:19.892
the family's
fortune.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.127
He wanted to get out
of avionics

24:21.160 --> 24:23.262
and into his own airline.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.999
And it's a good plan,
but it involved leveraging

24:27.033 --> 24:29.536
every remaining asset
the McAllisters had.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.103
The brother didn't agree.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.039
Lieutenant was cashing out
of the company?

24:33.072 --> 24:34.173
And going
his own way.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.275
This is the contract

24:36.308 --> 24:38.545
divesting them of
all family business.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.646
Where'd you get this?

24:39.679 --> 24:41.180
Oh, you don't
want to know.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.816
What you want to do is look
at the date.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.554
"October 5, 2002."

24:47.587 --> 24:49.088
COOPER:
The weekend he vanished.

24:49.121 --> 24:53.159
Luckily for the little brother,
he didn't sign the contract.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.160
I don't believe in luck.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.528
Neither do I.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.763
So,

24:56.796 --> 24:59.165
when you bringing
McAllister in?

24:59.198 --> 25:00.166
I'm not.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.068
COOPER:
W-What?!

25:02.101 --> 25:03.903
But-But it's all there.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.304
Motive, opportunity--

25:05.337 --> 25:07.106
the calls
on the lieutenant's cell phone?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.841
When you were a cop,
did you let

25:08.875 --> 25:10.743
civilians lay
out your cases,

25:10.777 --> 25:12.612
or did you work them yourself?

25:12.645 --> 25:14.246
NCIS has had this case
for two years.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.715
How long am I supposed to wait?

25:15.748 --> 25:16.883
Till I'm done.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.685
You are looking
for the reward.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.119
I am looking for a killer.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.189
Thomas McAllister is
your man, trust me.

25:23.222 --> 25:26.092
I don't trust anyone, either.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.193
Kate,

25:27.226 --> 25:29.095
how is your rapport

25:29.128 --> 25:30.797
with McAllister?
She's got more

25:30.830 --> 25:32.264
than a rapport, boss.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.232
GIBBS:
Well, good.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.567
Call him.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.102
You're having dinner
with him tonight.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.170
What if he says no?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.138
Oh, the way he was
looking at you,

25:39.171 --> 25:41.273
I think you're gonna
be the one saying no.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.076
GIBBS:
McGee, you find
my psychic yet?

25:44.110 --> 25:46.112
I have her business address.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.114
It's a TV talk show set in D.C.
She's there now.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.282
DiNozzo, you're with me.
Hey, Cooper.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.619
I trust
you can find your way out.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.160
Do you believe in any
of this psychic stuff?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.629
No. You?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.864
Ah, used one on a, uh,
case in Baltimore once.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.266
Led us right to
this kidnapped
five-year-old girl.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.835
That a fact?

26:08.868 --> 26:10.737
Yeah. How do you
explain that?

26:10.770 --> 26:12.939
Simple. She was probably
in on it.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.273
MAN:
Rolling.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.176
Special Agent Gibbs
and DiNozzo, NCIS.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.712
Looking to find
Saleena Lockhart.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.213
Yeah, she's inside.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.682
But you can't go in.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.350
Hey. Hey wait.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.052
They're still shooting!

26:27.820 --> 26:29.822
Man.

26:29.856 --> 26:32.058
And your grandfather
wants you to know

26:32.091 --> 26:34.193
that he will always be
with you, Sally.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.028
Always.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.897
( Sally cries, applause )

26:37.930 --> 26:40.700
SALLY:
Thank you so much, Saleena.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.868
( Sally cries )

26:41.901 --> 26:43.102
And remember,

26:43.135 --> 26:45.738
look and you shall see,

26:45.772 --> 26:48.174
listen and you will hear.

26:48.207 --> 26:52.111
Our departed loved ones
still have much to teach us.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.279
( applause )

26:53.312 --> 26:54.080
Huh.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.683
( applause and cheering )

26:56.716 --> 27:00.352
You think this is
how they do it on
the Oprah show?

27:00.386 --> 27:02.121
Never believe
what you see on TV.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.422
Until next time,

27:03.455 --> 27:05.291
I'm Saleena Lockhart.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.959
And cut!
WOMAN:
Cutting!

27:06.993 --> 27:09.128
"Look and you shall sea,"
spelled s-e-a?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.396
What kind of third-grader

27:10.429 --> 27:12.298
is writing
these cue cards?

27:12.331 --> 27:13.700
Just give us
ten minutes,

27:13.733 --> 27:15.134
and we'll
shoot it again.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.036
I am financing this pilot
with my own money.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.337
I can't afford another
of your

27:18.370 --> 27:19.338
ten minutes.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.239
SALLY:
If anybody
needs me,

27:20.272 --> 27:21.808
I'll be in craft service.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.010
Well, make sure you save some
for the rest of the crew.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.947
Okay. What?!
There are two guys
here to see you.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.381
I tried to stop them.
Sorry.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.418
Special Agents...
Gibbs and DiNozzo.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.854
From, uh, NCIS.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.188
How may I help you?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.389
You're the psychic,
you tell me.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.391
Brian McAllister.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.327
You found his remains
in Black Lake.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.363
Wow, she's good, boss.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.232
It's on the news, DiNozzo.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.367
No, I-I told Brian's father

27:48.400 --> 27:51.237
that I-I felt
Brian was in a cold,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.072
dark place.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.074
You could say that.
He was murdered.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.376
Yes.
Yes, he told me.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.078
Who?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.146
Brian.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.049
We connected through a passage
on the other side.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.250
Passage?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.085
That's what you call it?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.287
You look skeptical.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.321
But it-/////!s okay.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.123
You don't have to believe.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.292
So, uh, he tell
you who did it?

28:13.325 --> 28:15.061
It doesn't work that way,
Agent DiNozzo.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.896
Can I get a green tea,
please?

28:16.929 --> 28:18.230
How does it work?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.999
Well, I-I get

28:20.032 --> 28:21.968
impressions, feelings.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.236
I don't get specific details.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.204
You have any feeling

28:25.237 --> 28:27.239
about his father including you
in his will?

28:27.273 --> 28:28.975
I didn't ask him.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.176
I'm not a psychic,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.979
but considering
he's a Navy fighter pilot--

28:33.012 --> 28:35.314
I'd say he'd be pretty
pissed off about it.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.417
Your point, Agent Gibbs?

28:38.450 --> 28:39.786
Where were you the weekend

28:39.819 --> 28:41.954
Lieutenant McAllister
was murdered?

28:41.988 --> 28:44.991
LOCKHART:
Luray.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.359
Luray Caverns. I was hosting
a spiritual retreat.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.829
Luray? Hey, boss,
isn't that about 15 miles

28:49.862 --> 28:51.864
from, uh, Black Lake?

28:53.966 --> 28:57.369
Can you tell me
what I'm thinking now,

28:57.403 --> 28:59.405
Miss Lockhart?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.343
You don't have to be
a psychic to tell that.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.545
Could we discuss this
outside, please?
Your...

29:06.578 --> 29:09.348
energy is disrupting my set.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.019
Thank you.

29:14.453 --> 29:18.057
Look, I had nothing to do
with Brian's disappearance.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.358
You should talk
to his brother.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.927
Yeah? Why is that?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.394
Thomas was the black sheep.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.063
Oh, and he hated Brian.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.400
I may be many things,
Agent Gibbs,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.369
but I am not a murderer.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.104
But you talk
to dead people.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.874
I have over a dozen people

29:34.907 --> 29:37.543
who can verify my whereabouts
on that weekend.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.811
One of them is a senator.

29:38.845 --> 29:39.946
We'll need
their names.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.347
My lawyer will get them to you.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.548
Now,

29:42.581 --> 29:45.317
is there anything else
I can do for you?

29:47.486 --> 29:48.320
( screams )

29:48.354 --> 29:49.922
( gunfire, glass breaking )

29:49.956 --> 29:51.790
Didn't see that one coming,
did you?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.430
Son of a bitch.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.465
Did you get
a license number?

29:59.498 --> 30:00.466
Yeah, I got one.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.836
That's a good job, Tony.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.840
ABBY:
It's definitely
from a .45 round, guys.

30:07.874 --> 30:10.476
Just give me a sec
to line up the rifling patterns.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.544
You run the plates?

30:12.578 --> 30:13.379
Came back stolen.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.546
Figures.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.316
( beeps )

30:17.349 --> 30:19.085
The markings match.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.386
It's from the same pistol

30:20.419 --> 30:22.088
that killed
Lieutenant McAllister

30:22.121 --> 30:24.123
two years ago.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.967
Why don't we just drag
McAllister in

30:35.001 --> 30:36.168
for questioning, boss?

30:36.202 --> 30:38.204
Because his lawyers
make more in one hour

30:38.237 --> 30:39.906
than you make all week.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.008
That's an excellent point-- so
you're saying I deserve a raise?

30:42.041 --> 30:43.575
Or not.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.511
We need more than
circumstantial evidence to take

30:45.544 --> 30:46.979
McAllister down.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.048
I agree, but what do we get
out of Kate going

30:49.081 --> 30:50.516
on a date with him?
I get to search
his house

30:50.549 --> 30:52.251
for that Colt .45
without him knowing about it.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.886
And if it turns out
he's our murderer?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.487
That's why you're
going with her.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.891
I'm meeting him at the airport
in 20 minutes, Gibbs.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.326
Hey, you need to distract him
for at least

31:00.359 --> 31:02.228
two hours so we can
search his house.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.229
Shouldn't be a problem.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.931
He already invited me to dinner.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.406
So... how do I look?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.209
Eh.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.279
What do you mean, "eh"?

31:20.312 --> 31:23.149
I mean, yeah,
you look fine.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.217
( sighs )

31:25.251 --> 31:26.285
What's wrong with fine?

31:26.318 --> 31:29.055
I'm going for
hot here, Tony.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.622
Well, in that case,
do you mind?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.194
Boss...

31:36.395 --> 31:37.663
...got the search warrant.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.498
Yeah. You're with me.
Get your things.

31:39.531 --> 31:40.967
( Tony blows )
( Kate gasps )

31:44.103 --> 31:46.172
( laughs ):
Yeah, now that...

31:46.205 --> 31:47.506
that is hot.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.175
GIBBS:
You two done
playing dress-up?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.176
KATE/TONY:
Done.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.210
GIBBS:
All right.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.712
Get moving; I want
a comm check in 15 minutes.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.680
On it.

31:54.713 --> 31:57.283
Hey, Kate, it looked better
the other way.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.260
TONY:
How you reading me, Kate?

32:08.294 --> 32:10.229
Say again?
KATE:
I said,

32:10.262 --> 32:12.164
loud and clear.
Slide the mic

32:12.198 --> 32:13.632
closer to your throat, please.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.634
How's that?

32:15.667 --> 32:16.668
Crystal.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.109
Hello?

32:25.577 --> 32:28.247
Hello?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.182
Kate.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.550
Whoa.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.485
Do I feel underdressed.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.421
Well, when you said dinner...

32:35.454 --> 32:37.589
Hey, I'm not complaining.
You look fantastic.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.225
Thank you.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.159
So, where we going?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.328
Actually, I thought
we might stay here.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.330
If you survive my cooking,
there's a few things

32:44.363 --> 32:45.664
I'd like to tell you
about my big brother.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.772
( crickets chirping )

32:53.805 --> 32:55.341
McGEE:
Uh, boss, where we going?

32:55.374 --> 32:56.575
GIBBS:
Going around back, McGee.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.580
( sighs ):
It's locked, boss.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.749
Well, yeah, McGee--
that's kind of the point

33:03.782 --> 33:05.451
of having doors.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.220
Well, the last two times

33:08.254 --> 33:10.189
I encountered
a situation like this,

33:10.222 --> 33:12.424
Tony threw a rock
through a window,

33:12.458 --> 33:15.261
Kate climbed in a
second-story window.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.495
Huh.

33:18.297 --> 33:22.034
You don't say.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.038
Let's go.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.442
I wasn't entirely
truthful this
afternoon, Kate.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.711
When you come
from the type

33:32.744 --> 33:35.514
of family I did, you get
used to keeping secrets.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.385
What kind of secrets?

33:40.419 --> 33:42.221
My parents were always
a bit eccentric.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.157
When my mom died,
my dad pretty much lost it.

33:45.191 --> 33:48.394
He started talking
to dead people?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.562
You been checking up on me.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.598
It's my job, Tom.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.734
At first, I thought
it was harmless,

33:55.767 --> 33:57.636
but this psychic
he was seeing--

33:57.669 --> 33:59.638
she started
manipulating him,

33:59.671 --> 34:02.474
really cutting him off
from the rest of the family.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.176
Saleena Lockhart.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.645
Really checking
up on me.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.314
What did your brother
think of her?

34:08.347 --> 34:12.318
He didn't. Brian was too busy
with his naval career.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.820
He wasn't around to see
the damage she was doing.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.789
Somebody tried
to kill her today.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.628
Thought of it myself,
more than once.

34:23.662 --> 34:26.498
A lot of people think
it was you.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.635
What do you think, Kate?

34:31.537 --> 34:33.472
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

34:45.417 --> 34:48.287
( door creaking )

34:57.329 --> 34:58.530
NCIS!

34:58.564 --> 34:59.265
( grunts )

35:00.299 --> 35:03.535
Guys, do you mind?

35:05.604 --> 35:06.505
Cooper...

35:08.440 --> 35:09.741
...what are you doing here?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.443
Same thing you are.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.445
I have a warrant.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.448
You gonna arrest me?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.449
It depends.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.450
On what?

35:18.484 --> 35:20.452
What you found.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.154
I'm hoping a million dollars.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.556
I checked all the
local counties.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.557
Thomas McAllister

35:25.591 --> 35:27.559
doesn't own any
handguns, but...

35:27.593 --> 35:29.261
his old man?

35:29.295 --> 35:30.729
( clicks tongue )

35:30.762 --> 35:32.564
Bit of a gun nut.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.801
Even owns a Colt .45.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.477
( sniffs )

35:45.511 --> 35:46.545
Recently fired.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.782
( phone ringing )

35:50.816 --> 35:52.484
DiNozzo.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.253
Yeah, boss?
Tony.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.288
Take him down.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.323
I'm on it.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.393
I called Brian
the weekend he went missing.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.462
I was trying to get him
to come home,

36:03.495 --> 36:05.464
talk some sense into Dad.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.299
He said he'd think
about it.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.634
Why would you lie
to us about it?

36:08.667 --> 36:11.503
Because I thought that...

36:11.537 --> 36:13.539
I was responsible
for his death.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.274
Were you?

36:16.308 --> 36:17.809
When they found his
car in Black Lake,

36:17.843 --> 36:20.512
I thought he finally decided
to listen to me for once.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.649
The roads in Hastings
are deathtraps in the daytime.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.618
At night, when you're tired...

36:26.652 --> 36:28.520
You thought it was an accident.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.257
Until you told me
he was murdered.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.226
Only one person stood
to gain from his death:

36:34.260 --> 36:35.927
Saleena Lockhart.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.797
Unfortunately,
there is one more.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.844
He never would've signed this.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.646
TONY:
Thomas McAllister.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.984
You're under arrest
for the murder of your brother.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.456
So I guess dessert
is out of the question.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.836
You okay?

37:17.869 --> 37:20.238
I'm fine.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.008
You don't look fine.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.610
I hope I'm getting
overtime

37:24.643 --> 37:25.577
for this, Gibbs,

37:25.611 --> 37:27.379
because I'm missing
my cousin's birthday.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.179
Were they a match?

37:28.213 --> 37:29.315
It's the same weapon
that killed

37:29.348 --> 37:31.650
the lieutenant and shot up
the makeup trailer today.

37:31.683 --> 37:32.684
GIBBS:
Thanks, Abbs.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.687
KATE:
Mm, figures.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.423
I finally meet a nice guy,

37:37.456 --> 37:40.726
and he turns out
to be a murderer.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.893
( Abby laughs )

37:41.927 --> 37:44.563
Happens to Tony
all the time.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.399
Hey, do me a favor, Kate.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.635
KATE:
What?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.570
My back is killing me.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.339
I'm waiting.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.773
And don't shortchange me
this time.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.409
You know, your muscles
wouldn't be so tight

37:57.443 --> 37:59.411
if you'd stop drinking
all that caffeine crap

37:59.445 --> 38:00.712
that Gibbs is always
bringing you.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.449
ABBY:
Oh, but I love
the caffeine crap, Kate.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.450
Abby!

38:04.483 --> 38:05.884
Need you out here.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.586
Now!

38:09.120 --> 38:11.423
How much time did you spend
on this door?

38:11.457 --> 38:13.091
Um, enough to get the
bullet's trajectory.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.561
I was going to test for metal
fatigue and age in the morning.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.895
Do it tonight.
Why?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.930
I mean, I'll have it

38:18.964 --> 38:21.600
for you in 30
minutes, sir.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.702
Kate'll help.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.842
Well, looks like
you did it again, Mr. Cooper.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.578
I'm getting old, kid.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.613
Think I'm going to retire
after this one.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.981
You ask me,
we should get

38:36.014 --> 38:38.550
50% of that million.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.586
Too bad life ain't fair,
DiNozzo.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.588
Oh, it's about time.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.423
In my day,
we didn't wait

38:44.456 --> 38:46.091
two hours
to interrogate someone.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.927
Let me guess--
you just beat it out of 'em?

38:48.960 --> 38:51.763
Yeah, something like that.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.466
McALLISTER:
I'm sure you hear this a lot.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.669
I'm innocent,
Agent Gibbs.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.505
I know.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.777
What the hell kind
of interrogation is that?

39:05.811 --> 39:08.614
You're free to go,
Mr. McAllister.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.788
It's not enough
I do your job for you?

39:16.822 --> 39:18.724
Now you want
to arrest me for it?

39:18.757 --> 39:19.791
Ah, we do owe you
for finding

39:19.825 --> 39:22.127
the lieutenant for us,
Cooper.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.863
The problem is...
it isn't murder.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.466
( chuckling ):
Oh, give me a break, Gibbs.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.635
You saw the evidence.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.637
I did.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.939
Brian McAllister died
in a car accident.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.542
The bullet fired

39:36.575 --> 39:39.110
into his car wasn't
from two years ago.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.516
The metal around the impact

39:44.550 --> 39:47.152
was only recently
exposed to water.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.757
Two weeks sound

39:51.790 --> 39:53.525
about right to you?

39:53.559 --> 39:56.027
What's this got
to do with me?

39:57.796 --> 40:01.600
The reward was offered for
finding the lieutenant's killer.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.602
In order to collect, you
had to manufacture one.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.670
( scoffs )

40:04.703 --> 40:06.705
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.739
Oh, it might've
worked.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.709
I mean, we would've found
that gun eventually,

40:10.742 --> 40:12.811
but you just
couldn't wait.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.546
What were you
going to do

40:14.580 --> 40:15.781
with the money,
Cooper?

40:15.814 --> 40:19.150
Hmm? Gambling debts?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.953
Retirement?

40:21.987 --> 40:24.856
Taking those shots
at Saleena Lockhart--

40:24.890 --> 40:27.092
that was overkill.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.927
Too bad we caught you
putting it back.

40:28.960 --> 40:29.961
Yeah?

40:30.996 --> 40:33.198
Good luck proving it.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.767
Oh, I will.

40:37.235 --> 40:41.106
This is an Instant
Shooter I.D. Kit.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.842
It'll tell me
if you fired a gun recently.

40:43.875 --> 40:44.876
( laughs )

40:44.910 --> 40:47.713
Swab away, Gibbs.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.715
There's no gun residue
on these hands.

40:49.748 --> 40:50.982
Aw, a private
dick like you--

40:51.016 --> 40:52.751
I bet you were wearing
rubber gloves.

40:52.784 --> 40:57.789
I figure any man
who solves the unsolvable

40:57.823 --> 41:01.226
needs a trademark,
and I'm betting yours is

41:01.259 --> 41:03.028
that tacky trench coat.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.930
You probably never
take it off, huh?

41:16.775 --> 41:18.910
This comes up blue,

41:18.944 --> 41:21.212
I've got you
for attempted murder.

41:31.623 --> 41:35.493
Good luck trying to collect
that million dollars.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.601
Get up.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.235
I don't believe it.

41:44.269 --> 41:45.103
Sorry, probie.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.806
I felt the same way
when I found out

41:47.839 --> 41:49.007
professional
wrestling was fake.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.643
But he was going to frame
an innocent man

41:51.677 --> 41:53.144
just for the reward?

41:53.178 --> 41:55.681
It's all about
the Benjamins.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.783
( grunts )
( handcuffs clicking )

41:57.816 --> 41:59.685
Sometimes.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.857
Not always.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.797
You up for that dessert now?

42:11.830 --> 42:12.898
( quiet laugh )

42:12.931 --> 42:14.800
At 2:30 in
the morning?

42:14.833 --> 42:17.302
I think I might know a place

42:17.335 --> 42:19.137
that's still open.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.139
And where would that be?

42:21.172 --> 42:23.842
New York.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.811
Sometimes it's good to
own your own airline.

42:25.844 --> 42:28.546
New York? I love New York.

42:32.350 --> 42:35.153
It's a small plane, Tony.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.122
Maybe next time.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.892
