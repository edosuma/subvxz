WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.922
All right, that's

00:02.085 --> 00:04.922
enough for me.

00:04.964 --> 00:06.799
You coming to bed?

00:06.841 --> 00:08.216
Yeah, in a minute.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.427
(channels changing)

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
(melodramatic music plays)

00:16.099 --> 00:18.477
(heated Spanish dialogue)

00:22.105 --> 00:23.941
Whoa.

00:23.983 --> 00:27.068
WOMAN:

00:23.983 --> 00:27.068
Bastardo.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.654
(TV clicks off)

00:28.696 --> 00:30.489
(sniffles)

00:33.283 --> 00:35.661
Wow! You sure

00:33.283 --> 00:35.661
got up early.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.079
Yup. No rest

00:35.703 --> 00:38.079
for the weary.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.373
Wait a minute.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.667
Did you even come to bed

00:39.414 --> 00:41.667
last night?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.960
No, dear.

00:43.002 --> 00:46.005
I stayed up all night

00:43.002 --> 00:46.005
watching Mexican soap operas.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.923
(laughs) Bye-bye.

Hi, Lois.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.504
Oh! Hi, Craig.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.131
Notice anything different

01:27.546 --> 01:30.131
about me?

01:30.173 --> 01:31.174
Nope.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.843
Just got her in today.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.137
"Craig Feldspar.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.137
Assistant Manager."

01:36.179 --> 01:37.305
Congratulations.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.515
That's great.

01:38.557 --> 01:39.975
And along

01:38.557 --> 01:39.975
with the red badge,

01:40.017 --> 01:41.977
as you know, comes an extra

01:40.017 --> 01:41.977
two-percent discount,

01:42.019 --> 01:44.521
which I'm more than willing

01:42.019 --> 01:44.521
to share with you, Lois.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.147
Oh, no, Craig,

01:44.563 --> 01:46.147
that's  your  discount.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.649
Really, it's no...

01:46.189 --> 01:47.649
I wouldn't feel right

01:47.691 --> 01:48.776
about jeopardizing

01:47.691 --> 01:48.776
your position

01:48.817 --> 01:50.235
by taking

01:48.817 --> 01:50.235
advantage of that.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.154
I just... I wouldn't

01:50.277 --> 01:53.154
feel right about it.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.740
But what good

01:53.196 --> 01:54.740
is all that power

01:54.782 --> 01:56.742
if I have no one

01:54.782 --> 01:56.742
to share it with?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.160
Theresa, would you mind

01:56.784 --> 01:59.160
checking out aisle four?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.162
Seemed to have noticed someone

01:59.202 --> 02:01.162
knocked over the candy rack.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.999
And could you put the

02:01.204 --> 02:03.999
coffee-toffees on a lower shelf?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.417
Okay.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.169
Did you see that?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.169
Did you see that resentment?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.421
Isn't it wonderful?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.673
Look at me, I'm shaking.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.010
This is

02:12.841 --> 02:15.010
my favorite part of the day.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.471
The twilight time

02:15.052 --> 02:17.471
between school ending

02:17.512 --> 02:19.222
and when your parents come home.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.142
The time

02:19.264 --> 02:22.142
when kids rule the Earth.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.229
(timer dings)

02:26.271 --> 02:28.356
Okay, what was this?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.191
Uh... Superman.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.486
(car pulling up)

02:34.613 --> 02:36.197
HAL:

02:34.613 --> 02:36.197
Boys, come quick!

02:36.239 --> 02:38.450
Something wonderful

02:36.239 --> 02:38.450
has happened!

02:39.242 --> 02:40.201
Huh?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.495
Isn't she beautiful?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.914
And to think someone

02:41.536 --> 02:43.914
was just throwing her out.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.582
She was under six

02:43.956 --> 02:45.582
bags of garbage,

02:45.624 --> 02:48.127
but, oh, I knew your

02:45.624 --> 02:48.127
mother would love her.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.210
When does she get home?

02:49.252 --> 02:50.629
She's working till 10:00.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.629
Great!

02:50.671 --> 02:53.214
Gives us plenty of

02:50.671 --> 02:53.214
time to get her ready.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.466
Dad, it's junk.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.844
Reese, with a little paint

02:54.508 --> 02:56.844
and some new hardware,

02:56.885 --> 02:59.805
one man's junk is another

02:56.885 --> 02:59.805
man's anniversary present.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.640
Come on, help me

02:59.847 --> 03:01.640
get her inside.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.390
(crying)

03:02.432 --> 03:03.642
(knocking)

03:03.684 --> 03:04.685
Come in.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.436
Look,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.647
you probably think

03:06.478 --> 03:08.647
I'm here to criticize you

03:08.689 --> 03:10.732
for not doing my homework

03:08.689 --> 03:10.732
yesterday,

03:10.774 --> 03:12.400
but let's not think

03:10.774 --> 03:12.400
about that.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.820
Let's think about

03:12.442 --> 03:14.820
tomorrow's assignment.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.239
So, if you can get that to me

03:14.862 --> 03:18.239
by 8:00, that'd be great.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.658
(crying)

03:19.700 --> 03:21.242
Or 9:00.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.244
(crying continues)

03:23.286 --> 03:24.454
Okay, what's wrong?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.832
My Julie...

03:26.874 --> 03:28.416
she left me!

03:28.458 --> 03:29.334
What happened?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.086
I don't know,

03:31.128 --> 03:33.505
but it's really over.

03:33.547 --> 03:37.176
She sent back all

03:33.547 --> 03:37.176
of my love gifts.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.259
(crying)

03:38.301 --> 03:41.262
Wow, that's cold.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.306
Oh, come on,

03:41.304 --> 03:43.306
this guy's adorable.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.850
Press its belly.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.727
That's okay.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.312
Look, I've had a lot of

03:46.768 --> 03:49.312
experience with heartache,

03:49.354 --> 03:50.939
and I'll tell you one thing.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.775
You've got to find a way

03:50.981 --> 03:53.775
to get your mind off it.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.277
Look! Here's my homework.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.446
I don't know

03:56.319 --> 03:58.446
what I'm going to do.

03:58.488 --> 04:03.284
She was my light,

03:58.488 --> 04:03.284
my life and my world!

04:03.326 --> 04:04.327
She put out, huh?

04:04.369 --> 04:07.122
Like crazy!

04:11.334 --> 04:13.253
Can I help you?

04:14.379 --> 04:15.463
Give me your money.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.299
Oh, for crying

04:15.505 --> 04:18.299
out loud, again?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.677
Shut up and hand it over.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.677
Okay, just relax, cowboy.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.804
We have a way of doing

04:20.719 --> 04:22.804
this so nobody gets hurt.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.723
I give you every bit

04:22.846 --> 04:24.723
of money in this drawer,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.892
and you and your friend

04:24.765 --> 04:26.892
just leave. Okay?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.019
Okay.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.355
See? Nobody gets hurt.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.565
Nobody gets caught.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.358
Everybody happy. Okay?

04:35.400 --> 04:36.902
Lois, I think Cheryl A.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.904
flipped me off

04:36.944 --> 04:38.904
behind my back.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.530
Craig, I am, uh, I'm

04:38.946 --> 04:40.530
with some customers.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.323
There you go. Bye now.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.952
Did you enjoy your Lucky Aide

04:42.365 --> 04:44.952
shopping experience, gentlemen?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.494
Craig, uh, they're in a hurry.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.829
This won't

04:46.536 --> 04:47.829
take a second.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.706
I am Craig, the

04:47.871 --> 04:49.706
assistant manager.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.332
I can assure you,

04:49.748 --> 04:51.332
if there's one thing

04:51.374 --> 04:53.585
we value here at Luck Aide,

04:51.374 --> 04:53.585
it is customer satisfaction.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
We're satisfied.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.131
Well, you don't

04:54.836 --> 04:57.131
sound like it.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.175
Please, don't feel like you're

04:57.172 --> 05:00.175
going to hurt my feelings,

05:00.217 --> 05:01.509
because I'm learning here.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.011
Now, I'm sure there's

05:01.551 --> 05:03.011
something I could do

05:03.053 --> 05:04.721
to make this a better

05:03.053 --> 05:04.721
experience for you.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.932
Yeah. How about you walk me

05:04.763 --> 05:06.932
to every other register

05:06.974 --> 05:09.559
in this place and give me

05:06.974 --> 05:09.559
every cent you've got?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.145
That's a gun!

05:11.186 --> 05:12.146
Craig, calm down.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.438
Everybody, calm down.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.856
I've been through

05:13.480 --> 05:14.856
this five times.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.524
We just give them

05:14.898 --> 05:16.524
the money

05:16.566 --> 05:18.526
from all the other registers,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.526
and they'll leave.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.154
What about the safe?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.362
Safe?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.364
...ty.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.159
Safe-ty of the customers.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.451
I'll lock the doors.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.953
You start rounding up

05:26.493 --> 05:27.953
the customers.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.788
What, are you nuts?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.788
We got to get out of here.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.623
Come on, man. I'm tired of doing

05:29.830 --> 05:31.623
these dinky little holdups.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.083
Have you ever

05:31.665 --> 05:33.083
wanted to do

05:33.125 --> 05:35.085
something more important

05:33.125 --> 05:35.085
with your life?

05:35.127 --> 05:37.045
What do you mean, like,

05:35.127 --> 05:37.045
go back to school?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.173
No, man! Like

05:37.087 --> 05:39.173
breaking into a safe.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.801
Do you want to work at

05:39.214 --> 05:42.801
Orange Julius forever?

05:44.303 --> 05:48.347
All right, everybody

05:44.303 --> 05:48.347
over to sundries!

05:53.352 --> 05:55.022
Easy.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.275
Easy.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.568
(crashing)

06:00.610 --> 06:02.029
Easy.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
(panting)

06:07.450 --> 06:11.288
Whoo! Your mother's going

06:07.450 --> 06:11.288
to flip when she sees this.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.081
Ha-ha!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.002
Well, that's just crazy.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.419
Why would someone fill this

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
with hundreds

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
of hanging black bow ties?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.217
Those aren't

06:20.964 --> 06:23.217
bow ties.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.676
Those are bats.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.096
(all screaming)

06:37.772 --> 06:39.607
Don't you worry, Lois.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.110
Everything is going to be fine.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.110
Just fine and dandy.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.445
Yeah, keep waving

06:42.152 --> 06:44.445
that thing around, buddy-boy.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.447
You got

06:44.487 --> 06:46.447
a big surprise coming.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.910
Craig, that button has been

06:46.489 --> 06:49.910
disconnected for over a year.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.371
What?! Why?

06:49.951 --> 06:52.371
Because you kept

06:49.951 --> 06:52.371
hitting the damn thing.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.664
In an emergency, yes.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.664
That's what it's for.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.042
Oh, like an emergency

06:54.706 --> 06:57.042
when you saw a bee?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.960
Or when you saw that big fly

06:57.084 --> 06:58.960
that looked like a bee?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.837
How about when you thought

06:59.002 --> 07:00.837
you saw a ghost?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.881
I'm not saying it was

07:00.879 --> 07:02.881
or it wasn't,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.633
but you can't tell me

07:02.923 --> 07:05.633
what we saw was normal.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.551
All right, you two!

07:06.593 --> 07:07.761
Let's move it.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.721
He likes waving that

07:07.802 --> 07:09.721
around too much.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.472
This is going to end

07:09.763 --> 07:11.472
in body bags.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.059
No, Craig, it isn't.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.563
Lois... before we die,

07:14.101 --> 07:18.563
I have to tell you something.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.481
It's about how I feel...

07:20.523 --> 07:21.400
Craig, no.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.525
But, Lois...

07:21.441 --> 07:22.525
Craig, no!

07:22.567 --> 07:25.153
This will all

07:22.567 --> 07:25.153
be over soon.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.906
How much?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.283
Boy.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.493
Well, can you guarantee

07:29.324 --> 07:32.493
that you'll get all of them?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.289
What? That's per bat?!

07:35.330 --> 07:36.497
Are you insane?!

07:36.539 --> 07:37.958
God!

07:37.999 --> 07:40.501
Well, boys, looks like

07:37.999 --> 07:40.501
we're on our own.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.669
What are you

07:40.543 --> 07:41.669
talking about?

07:41.711 --> 07:42.754
Isn't anyone coming?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.713
I'm scared.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.090
Aw... I know, son.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.591
Now, just think

07:45.132 --> 07:46.591
of them this way.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.509
They're only

07:46.633 --> 07:48.509
rats with wings.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.677
And radar.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.512
Just flying rats

07:49.719 --> 07:51.512
with radar.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.014
Say it with me.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.014
Just...

07:53.056 --> 07:55.183
ALL:

07:53.056 --> 07:55.183
Flying rats with radar.

07:55.225 --> 07:55.976
Once again.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.518
ALL:

07:56.017 --> 07:57.518
Flying rats with...

07:57.560 --> 07:59.438
(all screaming)

08:00.605 --> 08:04.109
Okay, it's important that

08:00.605 --> 08:04.109
everybody just say calm.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.028
And don't make any sudden moves,

08:04.151 --> 08:07.028
or they'll kill you.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.323
And don't look

08:07.070 --> 08:09.323
them in the eye,

08:09.364 --> 08:10.782
or they'll kill you.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.161
And don't beg them not to

08:10.824 --> 08:14.161
kill you, or they'll kill you.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.121
I need you to

08:14.202 --> 08:16.121
stop talking.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.790
You! Assistant manager!

08:16.163 --> 08:18.790
Come here!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.583
This is it.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.543
I didn't feed my cat.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.795
Isn't it funny the things

08:23.837 --> 08:26.006
that go through your mind

08:23.837 --> 08:26.006
before you die?

08:26.047 --> 08:29.550
Craig, they just

08:26.047 --> 08:29.550
want to talk to you.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.387
Lois, before we're all killed

08:29.592 --> 08:32.387
in a bloody mess,

08:32.429 --> 08:33.472
I have to tell you...

08:33.513 --> 08:35.932
Shh! Let's not think

08:33.513 --> 08:35.932
those negative thoughts.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.768
Let's just give them the money

08:35.974 --> 08:38.768
and get them out of here.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.561
Hey, is there any way

08:38.810 --> 08:40.561
we can speed this along?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.606
Yeah. Somebody can give us

08:40.603 --> 08:43.606
the combination to the safe.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.985
Fine. I can't,

08:43.648 --> 08:46.985
but the assistant manager can.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.654
Craig, give them

08:47.027 --> 08:49.654
the combination to the safe.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.281
No.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.573
What?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.575
You can't have it.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.743
Yes, they can.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.662
Craig, give them

08:55.785 --> 08:57.662
the combination.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.831
Let me talk to them.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.585
(shouting):

09:01.624 --> 09:04.585
What's the combo?!

09:04.627 --> 09:05.795
Ca...

09:06.629 --> 09:08.589
(whimpers)

09:08.631 --> 09:11.301
♪ ♪

09:11.343 --> 09:14.595
See? Told you I'd

09:11.343 --> 09:14.595
make it all better.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.680
Better?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.640
How could this possibly

09:15.722 --> 09:17.640
cheer me up?

09:17.682 --> 09:20.060
Watching a bunch

09:17.682 --> 09:20.060
of naked, middle-aged women

09:20.101 --> 09:21.602
degrade themselves in a place

09:21.644 --> 09:23.646
that smells like urine

09:21.644 --> 09:23.646
and cigarettes?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.065
When you put it

09:23.688 --> 09:25.065
that way,

09:25.106 --> 09:27.817
you can make anything

09:25.106 --> 09:27.817
sound terrible.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.277
You know, sometimes

09:29.319 --> 09:31.405
you just make it

09:29.319 --> 09:31.405
so hard to be nice.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.450
Hey, you want to see

09:31.446 --> 09:35.450
the real show in back?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.326
No.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.785
Yes. Yes, he does.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.287
Cost you $50.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.540
Look, I only have $20,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.540
so let's just...

09:39.329 --> 09:41.540
Done.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.481
(bats squeaking)

10:23.081 --> 10:24.541
Hey, watch out!

10:24.583 --> 10:26.334
(screaming)

10:26.376 --> 10:27.668
(laughing)

10:27.710 --> 10:28.711
(screaming)

10:28.753 --> 10:29.712
You idiots!

10:29.754 --> 10:31.714
It was just Mom's bra.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.008
(groans)

10:36.553 --> 10:38.472
What?

10:38.513 --> 10:39.680
What is it?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.681
Kill it!

10:40.723 --> 10:41.975
Ow! Ah!

10:42.016 --> 10:44.102
Is it gone?!

10:46.938 --> 10:49.690
Dewey, it's gone.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.985
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:54.737 --> 10:55.780
You feeling better?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.282
Yeah, I think so. Thanks.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.199
Good.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.701
Now tell me

10:58.241 --> 11:00.701
the damn combination!

11:00.743 --> 11:01.869
No.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.956
Can I talk to you

11:01.911 --> 11:04.956
for a second?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.129
Listen, fellas.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.214
I want to get this over

11:11.171 --> 11:13.214
with as much as you do.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.425
So why don't you give me

11:13.256 --> 11:15.425
five minutes with him.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.512
I guarantee you I will get

11:15.467 --> 11:18.512
that combination for you.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.931
Listen, Craig, I think

11:18.553 --> 11:21.931
these guys really mean business.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.517
Now, you know and I know

11:23.558 --> 11:25.810
there is less than $700

11:23.558 --> 11:25.810
in that safe.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.770
Do you really think

11:25.852 --> 11:27.770
the lives of seven employees

11:27.812 --> 11:29.772
is worth less than $700?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.732
Lois, this isn't just

11:29.814 --> 11:31.732
about the money.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.194
Sometimes a man has

11:31.774 --> 11:34.194
to have his dignity.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.654
So what if they kill me?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.738
But before they kill you,

11:35.694 --> 11:37.738
they're going to try

11:37.780 --> 11:40.741
to get that combination

11:37.780 --> 11:40.741
from you any way they can.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.911
Can you picture yourself

11:40.783 --> 11:43.911
with shattered eye sockets?

11:43.953 --> 11:46.540
Because that's where

11:43.953 --> 11:46.540
they're going to start.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.125
They can break every one

11:46.581 --> 11:49.125
of your fingers and toes.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.002
They can even cut

11:49.167 --> 11:51.002
a couple of them off.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.754
Did... did you see the buck

11:51.044 --> 11:53.754
knife in the big guy's boot?

11:53.796 --> 11:58.426
Do you really want to antagonize

11:53.796 --> 11:58.426
that big buck knife, Craig?

11:58.468 --> 12:02.681
Do you really want to feel it

11:58.468 --> 12:02.681
slicing into your flesh?

12:02.721 --> 12:04.765
Craig, stay with me.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Stay...

12:06.809 --> 12:08.978
Damn.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.233
HAL:

12:11.064 --> 12:13.233
Pass the salt, please.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.277
How long do we have

12:13.274 --> 12:16.277
to stay in here?

12:16.319 --> 12:17.778
Till all the bats are gone.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.822
And with every window and door

12:17.820 --> 12:19.822
wide open in this house,

12:19.864 --> 12:21.700
it's only a matter of time.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.034
Can't new ones just fly in?

12:23.076 --> 12:26.705
So, Dewey, how

12:23.076 --> 12:26.705
was school today?

12:26.745 --> 12:27.788
Mikey Duffy

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
pushed me down.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
Did you push him back?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.501
No. He's bigger than me.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.793
Uh-huh. Reese?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.295
I'm on it.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.716
This is crazy!

12:37.756 --> 12:39.259
I can't eat!

12:39.300 --> 12:43.304
Why? Is something bothering

12:39.300 --> 12:43.304
you at school, son?

12:43.346 --> 12:46.224
Oh. Right.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.808
Anybody want my baked potato?

12:47.850 --> 12:48.851
It's kind of burnt.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.270
No, thanks.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.813
Reese, we aren't

12:50.311 --> 12:52.813
having baked potatoes.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.776
(all screaming)

13:06.369 --> 13:07.912
All right! That's it!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.247
Let's just move!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.831
Mom will find us somehow.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.250
HAL:

13:10.873 --> 13:12.250
No.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.628
I'm tired of running.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.131
I'm tired of screaming

13:14.669 --> 13:18.131
like a girl every five minutes.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.841
I will not be put out of my home

13:20.883 --> 13:23.844
by a bunch of airborne rodents,

13:20.883 --> 13:23.844
and neither will you!

13:23.886 --> 13:27.265
I may have been the one that

13:23.886 --> 13:27.265
brought them into this house,

13:27.307 --> 13:31.852
but it is up to all of us

13:27.307 --> 13:31.852
to show them the door.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.354
Get ready, boys.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.232
It's time to put out the bats.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.817
(all screaming)

13:46.909 --> 13:49.287
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

13:58.713 --> 14:00.548
Ha-ha!

14:07.722 --> 14:09.516
Ow!

14:11.559 --> 14:15.313
(all yelling)

14:19.942 --> 14:21.695
(all cheering)

14:21.736 --> 14:23.112
Oh, yeah!

14:23.946 --> 14:25.281
I got your money here!

14:25.323 --> 14:27.367
(crowd clamoring)

14:27.408 --> 14:30.495
Okay, this isn't exactly

14:27.408 --> 14:30.495
what we expected...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.913
but, hey, now you can say

14:30.537 --> 14:32.913
you've been to a cockfight.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.582
(bird squawks)

14:34.624 --> 14:37.168
Okay, Dewey,

14:34.624 --> 14:37.168
there's one bat left,

14:37.210 --> 14:39.003
and it's in your

14:37.210 --> 14:39.003
mother's room.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.005
Now, this one is

14:39.045 --> 14:41.005
the tricky bat,

14:41.047 --> 14:43.299
the one who has eluded

14:41.047 --> 14:43.299
all the other traps.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.301
What was it

14:43.341 --> 14:45.301
you named him?

14:43.341 --> 14:45.301
Tricky.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.928
Right. Well, now we

14:45.343 --> 14:47.928
have a very good trap,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.348
but someone has to

14:47.970 --> 14:50.348
lure Tricky into it,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.933
and that someone is you.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.353
Why me?

14:52.975 --> 14:55.353
Because...

14:55.395 --> 14:56.604
you have the shortest hair.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.980
You see, if he lands

14:56.646 --> 14:57.980
on your head,

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
he'll just bite once

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
and fly away,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.526
but if he lands on

14:59.566 --> 15:01.526
your brother's or my head,

15:01.568 --> 15:02.943
he'll get caught in our hair

15:02.985 --> 15:05.363
and bite us and bite us

15:02.985 --> 15:05.363
until we are dead.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.823
Do you understand that?

15:06.865 --> 15:07.948
Yes.

15:06.865 --> 15:07.948
Good.

15:07.990 --> 15:08.949
Now...

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
I want you to

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
go in that room

15:10.993 --> 15:14.955
and poke him with this stick

15:10.993 --> 15:14.955
until that bat chases you.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.916
Good luck.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.946
(screaming)

15:48.406 --> 15:50.700
(screaming continues)

15:54.829 --> 15:56.706
(spray hissing)

15:59.041 --> 16:00.960
(bat squeaking)

16:02.253 --> 16:05.256
(all cheering)

16:05.298 --> 16:07.216
I don't know about you, boys,

16:07.258 --> 16:10.970
but I am awfully

16:07.258 --> 16:10.970
darn proud of us.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.853
All right,

16:15.433 --> 16:18.853
somebody get the dustpan.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.111
Lois, are you

16:25.652 --> 16:27.111
all right?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.863
No, I am not all right.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.616
I'm sitting here at gunpoint,

16:28.905 --> 16:31.616
and I wouldn't have to be

16:31.658 --> 16:34.327
if you'd stop being stupid

16:31.658 --> 16:34.327
and give them the combination.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.036
I told you,

16:34.368 --> 16:36.036
I can't do that.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.831
Craig, please. I'm frightened.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.625
I want to go home

16:37.872 --> 16:40.625
and be with my family.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.210
They never told me

16:40.667 --> 16:43.210
the combination.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.421
What did you just say?

16:45.463 --> 16:47.131
They never told me

16:45.463 --> 16:47.131
the combination.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.342
They said they couldn't

16:47.173 --> 16:49.342
trust me with it.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.677
They gave the combination

16:50.718 --> 16:52.470
to the guy who runs

16:50.718 --> 16:52.470
the photo lab next door.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.639
He comes in at night

16:52.512 --> 16:54.639
and transfers the money.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.433
Why didn't you just

16:54.681 --> 16:57.433
say this earlier?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.769
I don't know. I guess

16:57.475 --> 16:59.769
I wasn't in a big rush

16:59.811 --> 17:03.815
to let everybody know

16:59.811 --> 17:03.815
what a pathetic idiot I am.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.067
Oh, Craig, I'm so sorry.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.235
Lois, I love you.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.654
What?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.656
Lois, I love you

17:09.696 --> 17:11.656
with all my heart.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.449
You're my reason to

17:11.698 --> 17:13.449
get up in the morning.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.242
You are my everything.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.242
Craig...

17:15.284 --> 17:17.077
Lois, I don't want

17:15.284 --> 17:17.077
to feel this way.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.080
I know you're married, I know

17:17.119 --> 17:20.080
you have four beautiful boys.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.499
It's my heart.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.669
I wish I didn't

17:21.541 --> 17:24.669
have a heart...

17:24.711 --> 17:27.672
but I do, and I can't

17:24.711 --> 17:27.672
help loving you.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.926
I can't help loving you with

17:27.714 --> 17:31.926
my stupid, stupid heart.

17:32.844 --> 17:37.348
Oh, Craig...

17:32.844 --> 17:37.348
why'd you have to say that?

17:39.141 --> 17:42.061
Dear sweet Craig.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.524
I am truly sorry.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.735
I'm sorry

17:46.566 --> 17:48.735
for the way you feel.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.905
I'm sorry for any indication

17:48.776 --> 17:51.905
I ever gave you

17:51.946 --> 17:54.114
that I consider you

17:51.946 --> 17:54.114
anything more than a friend.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.702
And I am so sorry

17:54.156 --> 17:57.702
for what I have to do now...

17:57.744 --> 18:00.580
because now I have to crush

17:57.744 --> 18:00.580
whatever it is in you

18:00.621 --> 18:03.123
that made you do

18:00.621 --> 18:03.123
what you just did.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.209
I am going to have

18:03.165 --> 18:05.209
to hurt you

18:05.251 --> 18:07.127
very, very badly,

18:05.251 --> 18:07.127
but believe me, Craig,

18:07.169 --> 18:09.463
it's for your own good.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.132
Number one...

18:12.174 --> 18:15.011
no to everything you just said.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.637
No to what you're thinking.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.848
No to everything you dream.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.182
No to your what-ifs.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.310
No to every single fantasy,

18:20.224 --> 18:23.310
wish, dream,

18:23.352 --> 18:26.022
and elaborate scenario

18:23.352 --> 18:26.022
that involves the two of us.

18:26.064 --> 18:30.150
No, no, no!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.361
Number two...

18:33.195 --> 18:34.154
Ow!

18:34.196 --> 18:35.615
Remember that pain.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.158
And whenever a thought

18:35.656 --> 18:38.158
creeps into your head

18:38.200 --> 18:39.452
wondering if there's

18:38.200 --> 18:39.452
anything more

18:39.493 --> 18:41.412
to the hello I gave you

18:39.493 --> 18:41.412
in the morning,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.247
you remember that pain.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.166
You have no future

18:43.289 --> 18:46.166
with me.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.670
You have nothing with me.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.130
I'm sorry.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.806
Whoa, chubs, you got faced.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.481
You want this?!

19:08.522 --> 19:12.151
You want this stupid,

19:08.522 --> 19:12.151
stupid, stupid safe?!

19:15.237 --> 19:17.865
Here's your stupid safe!

19:20.242 --> 19:22.745
Cool.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.209
Craig, are you all right?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.378
I don't know.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.378
I heard something rip,

19:31.420 --> 19:35.049
and if it wasn't my pants,

19:31.420 --> 19:35.049
it was inside of me.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.301
See? What'd I tell you?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.219
Cockfighting is illegal.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.513
But you made

19:39.261 --> 19:40.513
some good bets.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.222
What'd you win,

19:40.554 --> 19:42.222
ten bucks?

19:42.264 --> 19:45.225
You should feel

19:42.264 --> 19:45.225
good about that.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
We are going to jail!

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
When my parents find out,

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
I'll be living

19:49.271 --> 19:51.899
in military institutions

19:49.271 --> 19:51.899
until I'm emancipated!

19:51.941 --> 19:55.653
You don't even realize

19:51.941 --> 19:55.653
how serious this is, do you?!

19:57.363 --> 20:00.158
You know what the funny

19:57.363 --> 20:00.158
thing is though?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.535
You did manage to put things

20:00.199 --> 20:02.535
in perspective.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.704
There are worse things

20:02.576 --> 20:04.704
than losing your girlfriend,

20:04.745 --> 20:07.456
and I've experienced

20:04.745 --> 20:07.456
every one of them tonight.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.249
Thank you, Francis.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.626
I really owe you one.

20:10.668 --> 20:14.088
You know, I think I'll be back

20:10.668 --> 20:14.088
in circulation in no time.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.092
You never know.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.637
Craig, our assistant manager,

20:18.134 --> 20:21.637
just tossed the safe at them.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.347
I never saw anything like it.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.266
The guy's a hero.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.353

(groans)

21:10.144 --> 21:12.188

21:12.230 --> 21:14.356
You sure worked late.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.316
How was your night?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.944
Good.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.738
Yours?

21:20.780 --> 21:24.033
Fine.

21:24.075 --> 21:27.578
Why is there an armoire

21:24.075 --> 21:27.578
in the living room?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.873
Happy anniversary.
