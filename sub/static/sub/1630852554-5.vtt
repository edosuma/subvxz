I'm Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.400
Welcome to "Finding Your Roots."

00:15.133 --> 00:18.800
In this episode, we'll meet
talk show host Mario Lopez

00:19.566 --> 00:22.342
and comedian Melissa Villaseñor.

00:22.366 --> 00:26.209
Two people who are about
to uncover the long-lost stories

00:26.233 --> 00:28.500
of their Mexican ancestors...

00:28.766 --> 00:30.076
LOPEZ: That's crazy when
you just think about it

00:30.100 --> 00:31.376
in and of itself.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.842
You're going to these lands;
you have no idea what's there.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.042
Isn't that crazy
just to think about.

00:34.066 --> 00:35.276
GATES: They didn't even
know if they were going to fall

00:35.300 --> 00:36.342
off the earth.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.609
LOPEZ: Right!

00:37.633 --> 00:39.742
GATES: You ever think of
yourself as an indigenous woman?

00:39.766 --> 00:41.576
VILLASEÑOR: No.
GATES: No.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.066
VILLASEÑOR: But,
but I, I love that.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.242
GATES: To uncover their roots,

00:46.266 --> 00:48.709
we've used every
tool available...

00:48.733 --> 00:50.742
genealogists combed through
the paper trail their

00:50.766 --> 00:54.342
ancestors left behind,
while DNA experts utilized the

00:54.366 --> 00:58.142
latest advances in genetic
analysis to reveal secrets

00:58.166 --> 00:59.700
hundreds of years old.

01:00.866 --> 01:02.476
LOPEZ: Really?

01:02.500 --> 01:04.342
GATES: And we've compiled
everything into a

01:04.366 --> 01:05.542
book of life...

01:05.566 --> 01:06.776
VILLASEÑOR: I'm nervous.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.142
GATES: A record of all
of our discoveries...

01:09.166 --> 01:11.776
LOPEZ: Oh wow!

01:11.800 --> 01:14.009
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past...

01:14.033 --> 01:16.009
GATES: So, did you ever think
of your ancestors as refugees

01:16.033 --> 01:17.242
fleeing a war?

01:17.266 --> 01:18.909
LOPEZ: No.
GATES: But they did.

01:18.933 --> 01:21.133
LOPEZ: That's kind of cool.
GATES: It's very cool.

01:21.366 --> 01:23.609
It's not what we think
of Mexican immigration, right?

01:23.633 --> 01:25.642
LOPEZ: No, I'm blown away.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.742
VILLASEÑOR: It's,
it's wild to see this.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.642
GATES: Yeah.

01:29.666 --> 01:31.733
VILLASEÑOR: This is
making me emotional.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.676
GATES: My two guests have
roots that crisscross Mexico,

01:34.700 --> 01:37.133
Spain and California...

01:39.000 --> 01:42.076
In this episode, they'll
see what makes their family

01:42.100 --> 01:44.500
experiences unique...

01:44.766 --> 01:47.142
Exploring the sacrifices
their ancestors made in

01:47.166 --> 01:50.709
coming to this country and
the hardships they faced,

01:50.733 --> 01:52.700
and overcame, once they arrived.

02:06.300 --> 02:12.833
(theme music plays).

02:23.933 --> 02:27.466
♪ ♪

02:28.500 --> 02:31.176
GATES: Mario Lopez
is a multi-talented,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.333
multi-media phenomenon.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.509
Over the last three decades,
the actor, producer,

02:38.533 --> 02:40.309
Emmy-award-winning host,

02:40.333 --> 02:43.642
and best-selling
author has become a fixture

02:43.666 --> 02:45.866
of American popular culture...

02:47.166 --> 02:50.276
And his story is a
quintessential example of

02:50.300 --> 02:51.833
the American dream.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.876
When Mario was just
ten years old,

02:55.900 --> 02:59.176
he was cast in "A.K.A. Pablo"

02:59.200 --> 03:01.842
an ABC sitcom from
the legendary producer,

03:01.866 --> 03:05.400
Norman Lear, about a
Mexican American family in

03:05.766 --> 03:08.176
southern California.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.576
Mario got the role, in part,

03:10.600 --> 03:12.642
because his character's
background was so

03:12.666 --> 03:15.433
similar to his own...

03:16.566 --> 03:19.676
Both of his parents
were born in Mexico,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.866
and Mario grew up in
Chula Vista, California...

03:24.033 --> 03:27.033
just a few miles
north of the border.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.576
The experience would
shape him in ways both

03:29.600 --> 03:32.700
obvious and surprising.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.809
LOPEZ: It wasn't
necessarily the most, uh,

03:35.833 --> 03:37.776
upscale neighborhood and,
and the potential for a lot

03:37.800 --> 03:38.942
of trouble to get into.

03:38.966 --> 03:41.109
So, you know, my mom, kept
me busy and with a lot of

03:41.133 --> 03:42.242
different activities.

03:42.266 --> 03:45.176
So, I was the only dancing,
theater, wrestling,

03:45.200 --> 03:46.442
karate kid I knew,

03:46.466 --> 03:48.609
because I usually had an
activity after, after school.

03:48.633 --> 03:49.676
So, I was busy, and I...

03:49.700 --> 03:50.876
And it worked.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.309
I was so busy, I never
had time to really get in any

03:52.333 --> 03:53.509
kind of trouble.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.609
GATES: But how does a
ten-year-old land a

03:55.633 --> 03:57.242
Norman Lear sitcom?

03:57.266 --> 03:58.842
LOPEZ: When my mom
got me into dancing,

03:58.866 --> 04:02.376
there was a local talent
agent in San Diego that, uh,

04:02.400 --> 04:03.809
saw me dance and
approached her and said,

04:03.833 --> 04:05.176
"Hey, have you ever thought
about getting your kids into

04:05.200 --> 04:06.476
commercials and print work?"

04:06.500 --> 04:10.176
And my mom was like,
"Well, he reads well,

04:10.200 --> 04:13.109
and he doesn't shut up,
and he's not shy, so I,

04:13.133 --> 04:15.266
I don't know, let me ask him."

04:16.300 --> 04:19.766
GATES: "A.K.A. Pablo"
was not a hit,

04:20.200 --> 04:22.500
but Mario was
just getting started.

04:23.266 --> 04:26.709
Soon he landed a lead role
in "Saved by the Bell" a show

04:26.733 --> 04:30.600
that made him a household name
and launched his career...

04:33.133 --> 04:35.142
And even though he
spent much of his childhood

04:35.166 --> 04:37.042
in front of the camera,

04:37.066 --> 04:40.133
Mario kept his head by
staying close to his parents,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.333
who were not the types
to be dazzled by fame.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.376
LOPEZ: Oftentimes, a lot of
these parents want to live

04:47.400 --> 04:48.609
vicariously through their kids,

04:48.633 --> 04:49.942
and that wasn't the
case with my parents.

04:49.966 --> 04:52.542
They obviously didn't know
anything about it, had no, uh,

04:52.566 --> 04:54.576
history or background in
the entertainment field.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.709
But, um, they were
just supportive.

04:57.733 --> 04:58.909
And if it worked out, great.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.742
If it didn't, that's fine,
but you know, to this day,

05:00.766 --> 05:03.042
I'm, I'm always so
appreciative of my mom, uh,

05:03.066 --> 05:06.576
and my dad for driving me up
a few hours every day for an

05:06.600 --> 05:08.442
audition that maybe
was five minutes and then

05:08.466 --> 05:09.742
come right back.

05:09.766 --> 05:12.442
And uh like, every reaction,
whenever I did land something,

05:12.466 --> 05:13.509
it'd always be like,

05:13.533 --> 05:14.576
"Oh, that's nice, mijo."

05:14.600 --> 05:16.142
No one ever got too excited.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.209
(laughter).

05:17.233 --> 05:18.476
LOPEZ: Like my dad
always says, uh,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.333
"You still have never
had a real job."

05:21.566 --> 05:23.942
GATES: This sense
of perspective, and humor,

05:23.966 --> 05:27.033
would serve Mario well as
he grew into adulthood,

05:28.366 --> 05:31.676
helping him plot a
successful career path...

05:31.700 --> 05:35.200
an accomplishment that
eludes many child stars.

05:36.066 --> 05:39.542
A key moment came when
Mario met Dick Clark,

05:39.566 --> 05:43.376
the iconic television host,
who saw something of himself

05:43.400 --> 05:45.100
in the younger man.

05:46.733 --> 05:47.942
LOPEZ: We really hit it off,

05:47.966 --> 05:50.309
and he became a
friend and mentor.

05:50.333 --> 05:54.076
And he said, "Mario, you've
got a personality for hosting."

05:54.100 --> 05:55.109
Because I do like to host,

05:55.133 --> 05:56.976
whether it's hosting
game night at my house or

05:57.000 --> 05:58.842
having people over.

05:58.866 --> 06:00.176
I love to entertain.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.342
GATES: Yeah.

06:01.366 --> 06:02.576
LOPEZ: I love to make sure
people have a good time.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.776
GATES: Yeah.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.476
LOPEZ: I love to make sure
everyone's having fun and,

06:05.500 --> 06:07.342
and, uh, and, and
just kind of, uh,

06:07.366 --> 06:08.709
be the host of the party.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.442
And that's essentially
what you're doing on TV.

06:10.466 --> 06:13.709
So, Dick Clark sort of
opened my eyes to this world,

06:13.733 --> 06:14.776
and he goes,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.476
"You want to be on TV
for the next 50 years,

06:16.500 --> 06:17.976
I'm telling you,
you have the personality,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.266
you should look into doing
some hosting, be a host."

06:20.500 --> 06:21.842
And it kind of like
light bulb went off,

06:21.866 --> 06:24.209
and I'm like I want to be
the Latino, Dick Clark.

06:24.233 --> 06:25.509
GATES: That's great.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.693
LOPEZ: And that, that was my,
and that was my new plan.

06:29.133 --> 06:32.366
GATES: My second guest is
comedian Melissa Villaseñor,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.942
one of the leading lights
of "Saturday Night Live"

06:35.966 --> 06:38.976
since 2016, and a mainstay

06:39.000 --> 06:40.933
of the comedy circuit
for more than a decade.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.109
VILLASEÑOR: It stinks,
cause once guys find out,

06:44.133 --> 06:45.276
"Oh, Melissa does voices."

06:45.300 --> 06:46.642
"Well, do the hot voice."

06:46.666 --> 06:48.909
But I can't help it if, like,
a little bit of me pops out.

06:48.933 --> 06:49.910
You know?

06:49.934 --> 06:51.309
"What do you want
to do tonight, babe?"

06:51.333 --> 06:53.366
(sultry) Um, how about a
bath or something?

06:53.666 --> 06:55.342
"Ooh yeah. What else?"

06:55.366 --> 06:56.676
(normal) How about,
let's make some popcorn?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.800
"What did I say
about the voice?!"

06:59.433 --> 07:01.576
GATES: Like Mario,
Melissa grew up in a

07:01.600 --> 07:04.500
Mexican American community
in southern California.

07:06.366 --> 07:08.176
But while Mario got his
start on the set of a

07:08.200 --> 07:11.676
Norman Lear sitcom,
Melissa found her calling

07:11.700 --> 07:14.300
in a less auspicious venue...

07:15.433 --> 07:17.142
As a sophomore in high school,

07:17.166 --> 07:19.976
she got on stage
for a talent show,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.476
tried out some
celebrity impressions,

07:22.500 --> 07:25.933
and discovered that
she had a special gift.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.442
VILLASEÑOR:
I did Britney Spears...

07:28.466 --> 07:29.742
"Oh, yeah."

07:29.766 --> 07:30.809
A little Christina Aguilera...

07:30.833 --> 07:33.300
"Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

07:33.566 --> 07:34.576
GATES: What was the reaction?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.642
VILLASEÑOR:
Oh, it was amazing,

07:35.666 --> 07:37.409
a lot of people
stood up, clapped, and, and,

07:37.433 --> 07:39.142
and everyone was laughing and

07:39.166 --> 07:42.909
I felt like there was this
fire in my chest that just

07:42.933 --> 07:45.642
lit up and I woke up
in a way of, like,

07:45.666 --> 07:48.342
"This is what I'm
doing for my life."

07:48.366 --> 07:50.076
GATES: What did your parents
think when they heard that

07:50.100 --> 07:52.209
you had, you know,
blown the roof off?

07:52.233 --> 07:53.676
VILLASEÑOR:
I think they thought,

07:53.700 --> 07:56.942
"Oh, that's cute.
That's nice. But go to college."

07:56.966 --> 07:59.200
(laughter)

07:59.466 --> 08:01.709
GATES: Melissa would
follow her parent's advice and

08:01.733 --> 08:04.033
enroll in a local
community college.

08:05.533 --> 08:07.076
But, at the same time,

08:07.100 --> 08:09.900
she was also following
her passion for comedy,

08:10.833 --> 08:13.533
and the classroom
simply couldn't compare,

08:14.800 --> 08:17.733
causing Melissa a
great deal of sorrow.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.776
VILLASEÑOR: I went,
but I didn't show up.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.466
I, I didn't like it.

08:24.100 --> 08:28.676
And I always felt like the
sadness was a clear sign that

08:28.700 --> 08:29.909
I needed to be on stage.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.976
Every time I avoided, like,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.709
oh maybe I
shouldn't be a comedian,

08:33.733 --> 08:35.842
it's not working out.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.442
Like, I, you know I auditioned
for "SNL" when I was 21,

08:38.466 --> 08:39.642
I didn't get it.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.409
I was like,
"Maybe it's not working out.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.476
Maybe..."

08:42.500 --> 08:43.942
You know, I mean, obviously,

08:43.966 --> 08:45.642
I was so young then,
I shouldn't have got it.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.809
But, but I,
uh, I think when I...

08:47.833 --> 08:49.442
When I tried to avoid it,

08:49.466 --> 08:52.009
there was always a
feeling like, something is off,

08:52.033 --> 08:53.942
something is not right,

08:53.966 --> 08:56.333
and it's because I'm
supposed to be performing.

08:57.366 --> 09:00.342
GATES: When Melissa finally
accepted her calling,

09:00.366 --> 09:03.076
she faced another challenge:

09:03.100 --> 09:05.933
Stand-up comedy
is grueling work.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.809
VILLASEÑOR (impersonating):
Hi, I'm Sara Silverman and um

09:08.833 --> 09:10.242
Oh, my God.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.976
GATES: She spent almost a
decade trying to break in,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.709
taking her act to
talent shows and small venues

09:16.733 --> 09:18.542
across the country,

09:18.566 --> 09:21.133
all the while living
at home with her parents.

09:22.566 --> 09:25.500
In the end, her
determination paid off.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.642
After submitting
audition tapes every

09:28.666 --> 09:32.676
year for seven years,
she finally won over

09:32.700 --> 09:34.409
"Saturday Night Live's"

09:34.433 --> 09:37.133
executive producer
Lorne Michaels,

09:37.666 --> 09:40.209
landing her dream job.

09:40.233 --> 09:42.242
How did your parents
react when you told them, uh,

09:42.266 --> 09:44.142
that Lorne had called?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.109
(sighs).

09:46.133 --> 09:47.876
VILLASEÑOR: Well, this
is how this is how lovely

09:47.900 --> 09:49.676
my parents are.

09:49.700 --> 09:52.942
So, they were actually
in New York still when I

09:52.966 --> 09:54.042
got the call.

09:54.066 --> 09:55.176
So, what happened was,

09:55.200 --> 09:57.609
that week I flew out
for meetings with,

09:57.633 --> 10:00.809
to meet Lorne and
the writers on the show.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.776
They wanted to meet
me and just chat.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.133
Uh, and my parents surprised me.

10:06.466 --> 10:07.443
They flew out.

10:07.467 --> 10:08.542
GATES: Oh.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.942
VILLASEÑOR: Just to be
there in support of me.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.209
GATES: Oh, well that's great.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.842
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah,
I called them, I said,

10:12.866 --> 10:14.876
"Put, put this on speaker.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.076
You all need to hear."

10:16.100 --> 10:17.342
And they're like, "What?"

10:17.366 --> 10:19.776
I was like, "I'm on Saturday,
I got Saturday Night Live.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.976
I'm going to be on the cast."

10:21.000 --> 10:22.142
And they're screaming,

10:22.166 --> 10:24.142
they're crying,
they're hugging each other.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.442
It was unreal.

10:25.466 --> 10:28.476
It felt magical because they
are all a part of the journey.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.542
My parents, since day one they
would drive me to comedy clubs

10:31.566 --> 10:34.009
and improv classes,
or, you know...

10:34.033 --> 10:36.342
GATES: You're lucky.
VILLASEÑOR: Lucky. Yes.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.466
GATES: Yeah.
VILLASEÑOR: Very, very lucky.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.076
GATES: Meeting my guests,
it was clear that both are

10:41.100 --> 10:44.376
the products of
tight-knit families,

10:44.400 --> 10:47.142
but as the descendants
of recent immigrants,

10:47.166 --> 10:50.076
they also had fundamental
questions about how those

10:50.100 --> 10:51.866
families had been shaped.

10:52.666 --> 10:55.633
It was time to provide
them with some answers.

10:56.866 --> 11:00.409
I started with Mario,
and his paternal grandfather,

11:00.433 --> 11:03.300
Luciano Lopez-Burgos.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.166
Luciano was born
in Mexico in 1926,

11:09.133 --> 11:12.042
and ended up in
San Diego, California,

11:12.066 --> 11:14.800
supporting eight
children as a laborer.

11:15.733 --> 11:19.376
Along the way, he earned a
reputation for hard work that

11:19.400 --> 11:21.666
awed his entire family...

11:23.066 --> 11:25.076
GATES: Your father said that
for your grandfather, quote,

11:25.100 --> 11:28.133
"Every day was
work, work, work."

11:28.533 --> 11:29.576
LOPEZ: Yeah.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.676
GATES: Uh, is that
how you remember?

11:30.700 --> 11:31.942
LOPEZ: Yeah, he
was always working,

11:31.966 --> 11:33.242
even until his late years.

11:33.266 --> 11:34.442
GATES: Gee.

11:34.466 --> 11:35.410
LOPEZ: I remember that,
but that kind of, you know,

11:35.434 --> 11:36.709
it kept him going
and stuff, and so, yeah.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.076
GATES: As you got older, did
your grandfather's work ethic

11:39.100 --> 11:40.409
make sense to you?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.909
LOPEZ: Yeah.

11:41.933 --> 11:45.133
I appreciated it, and then,
even when all my...

11:45.766 --> 11:47.676
His kids were old enough
and had their own families

11:47.700 --> 11:48.677
and were doing their own thing,

11:48.701 --> 11:50.976
he continued that
strong work ethic, and I,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.442
it was just sort
of instilled in me.

11:52.466 --> 11:53.976
I never had friends spend
the night more than one night

11:54.000 --> 11:57.100
because my dad would
put them to work.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.609
He would hate to just
see us laying on the couch,

11:59.633 --> 12:00.742
watching TV.

12:00.766 --> 12:02.666
He'd get up and make
me do something.

12:04.466 --> 12:07.476
GATES: While Mario proudly
celebrates all that Luciano

12:07.500 --> 12:10.976
did to plant roots
in the United States,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.376
he had no idea about the
efforts that his grandfather

12:14.400 --> 12:17.800
had made simply to get
into this country...

12:19.333 --> 12:23.042
The story begins with a
document that Luciano filed in

12:23.066 --> 12:25.876
March of 1957...

12:25.900 --> 12:28.176
GATES: Would you please
read the title at the top

12:28.200 --> 12:29.533
of the page?

12:30.266 --> 12:31.942
LOPEZ: "Application for
permission to reapply,

12:31.966 --> 12:34.533
Tijuana, Mexico, 1957."

12:35.333 --> 12:37.776
GATES: The keyword in
that sentence is "reapply."

12:37.800 --> 12:38.976
LOPEZ: Reapply. Right.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.276
GATES: Have you ever
heard anything about this?

12:40.300 --> 12:42.076
LOPEZ: No.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.009
GATES: Look at the transcribed
section at the bottom.

12:45.033 --> 12:48.809
LOPEZ: "Removed from the
United States on or about 1952

12:48.833 --> 12:52.142
to Mexico from the port
of San Ysidro, California,

12:52.166 --> 12:54.409
I resided in the
United States for a period

12:54.433 --> 12:55.842
of approximately one month.

12:55.866 --> 12:57.209
At the time of removal,

12:57.233 --> 12:59.642
I was living in
Hanford, California."

12:59.666 --> 13:00.776
GATES: Do you know
what's happening here?

13:00.800 --> 13:01.842
Did you ever hear this story?

13:01.866 --> 13:04.033
LOPEZ: No. No.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.676
GATES: Luciano's "story" is
a classic example of the

13:07.700 --> 13:11.466
struggles faced by
migrant workers of his day,

13:12.333 --> 13:16.376
in 1952, when he was
about 26 years old,

13:16.400 --> 13:20.400
he sought work in farm
country north of Los Angeles.

13:21.733 --> 13:25.333
Lacking a visa, he
was here illegally,

13:25.533 --> 13:29.033
and soon that caught
up with him...

13:30.033 --> 13:33.476
After roughly one month,
Luciano was detained by

13:33.500 --> 13:37.909
immigration officials and
returned to Mexico via what

13:37.933 --> 13:40.600
was known as a
"voluntary departure",

13:41.266 --> 13:44.442
meaning no arrest warrant was
issued and no legal record of

13:44.466 --> 13:47.609
the incident was preserved.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.009
In theory, this should have
made it easier for him to

13:50.033 --> 13:52.409
re-enter the United States,

13:52.433 --> 13:57.200
as he attempted to do in 1957,
but, in the intervening years,

13:58.166 --> 14:01.409
the United States had become
considerably more hostile

14:01.433 --> 14:04.066
toward Mexican migration.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.442
LOPEZ: Oh wow.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.976
GATES: Please read
the transcribed section?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.042
LOPEZ: Wow.

14:09.066 --> 14:11.709
"Wetbacks herded
at Nogales Camp;

14:11.733 --> 14:14.276
these unwitting victims
of the US Operation Wetback

14:14.300 --> 14:16.509
milled around today for six hot,

14:16.533 --> 14:18.342
miserable hours in the
process of being loaded

14:18.366 --> 14:21.942
aboard a 15-car special
train for the final leg of

14:21.966 --> 14:24.500
their unwilling journey
back into their native Mexico.

14:25.133 --> 14:27.142
This is the end product
of the sweeping campaign

14:27.166 --> 14:28.976
launched by the US Immigration

14:29.000 --> 14:31.466
to clear the nation of
its illegal aliens."

14:31.833 --> 14:34.309
So, wetback was a,
an actual, literal term?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.109
It wasn't just a derogatory,

14:36.133 --> 14:40.342
I thought it was just a
derogatory, uh, term used.

14:40.366 --> 14:41.942
I didn't know that
they actually printed it.

14:41.966 --> 14:43.942
GATES: They are
using it because the

14:43.966 --> 14:46.509
United States government,
in 1954,

14:46.533 --> 14:48.809
the US Immigration
and Naturalization Service

14:48.833 --> 14:53.509
launched a program officially
known, governmentally, as...

14:53.533 --> 14:55.342
BOTH: "Operation Wetback".

14:55.366 --> 14:56.876
LOPEZ: Oh my god.
GATES: Can you believe that?

14:56.900 --> 14:57.909
LOPEZ: Wow.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.009
GATES: Can you
believe the name?

14:59.033 --> 15:00.409
They didn't even
think anything about it.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.433
LOPEZ: Wow. That's unbelievable.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.742
GATES: "Operation wetback"
was the cynical meeting ground

15:08.766 --> 15:12.800
of xenophobia,
racism, and economics...

15:15.500 --> 15:17.309
During World War II,

15:17.333 --> 15:20.033
the United States
created a guest visa program

15:21.300 --> 15:24.676
that allowed Mexican workers
to find temporary employment

15:24.700 --> 15:26.533
with American farmers.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.442
The program helped alleviate
the enormous labor shortages

15:31.466 --> 15:33.966
caused by the war.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.466
But by 1954, the
war was long over,

15:42.233 --> 15:44.476
and some Americans were
becoming increasingly

15:44.500 --> 15:48.466
concerned that Mexican workers
were undercutting their wages.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.409
In response, the
United States government

15:54.433 --> 15:57.042
launched the largest
deportation effort it

15:57.066 --> 15:59.733
had ever undertaken,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.909
using military tactics to
detain suspected migrants in

16:03.933 --> 16:08.233
holding camps before shipping
them across the border.

16:11.766 --> 16:12.942
LOPEZ: Wow.

16:12.966 --> 16:14.176
GATES: They went around
just rounding up people and

16:14.200 --> 16:15.276
throwing them out
of the country.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.376
LOPEZ: Wow.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.642
GATES: You wanna
hear the numbers?

16:17.666 --> 16:21.700
In 1954, there were
1.1 million removals.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.976
LOPEZ: That's unbelievable.
GATES: That's unbelievable.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.309
LOPEZ: That, wow.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.776
GATES: Can you imagine just
how perilous your life was?

16:29.800 --> 16:31.042
I mean, you're living in terror,

16:31.066 --> 16:32.409
and you can just be swept up...

16:32.433 --> 16:34.209
LOPEZ:
It's eye-opening, I mean...

16:34.233 --> 16:36.576
My grandfather was
a tough guy, but I,

16:36.600 --> 16:39.209
I regret not being
aware of this and,

16:39.233 --> 16:41.600
and talking to him about
it when he was alive.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.509
GATES: Why do you think
he never talked about it?

16:43.533 --> 16:45.909
LOPEZ: Maybe he just
didn't want to go there and

16:45.933 --> 16:48.476
put it behind him and,
and might make us angry.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.576
GATES: Uh-huh.
Or hurt, and...

16:50.600 --> 16:51.842
LOPEZ: Or hurt, yeah.

16:51.866 --> 16:53.209
GATES: I mean, what kind of
person wants to inflict pain

16:53.233 --> 16:54.210
on their grandchild, you know?

16:54.234 --> 16:56.333
LOPEZ: Sure. Right.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.876
GATES: Mario's grandfather
may have been angry about the

16:59.900 --> 17:02.676
obstacles placed
in front of him.

17:02.700 --> 17:06.042
But he was also doggedly
determined and soon he

17:06.066 --> 17:09.166
set out for the
United States yet again,

17:09.933 --> 17:12.000
embarking on a
remarkable journey...

17:13.500 --> 17:15.409
We found the details
of that journey in

17:15.433 --> 17:17.033
the national archives,

17:17.466 --> 17:21.866
set down in a record
dated July 3rd, 1969...

17:31.066 --> 17:33.942
National City,
San Diego, California.

I was born January 7, 1925 in

17:36.200 --> 17:39.042
Ranchitos, Culiacán,
Sinaloa, Mexico.

17:39.066 --> 17:40.809
Lawful admission for
permanent residence in the

17:40.833 --> 17:43.242
United States was at
San Ysidro, California

under the name of
Lucian Lopez-Burgos on

17:45.700 --> 17:47.576
September 10, 1957."

17:47.600 --> 17:48.842
Wow.

17:48.866 --> 17:52.142
GATES: You're looking at the
moment that your grandfather

17:52.166 --> 17:54.109
declared his intention
to become a citizen of the

17:54.133 --> 17:55.842
United States of America.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.409
LOPEZ: That's awesome.
GATES: Yeah.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.409
LOPEZ: That's very cool.
I love it.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.276
GATES: And if you look
at it closely again,

18:01.300 --> 18:03.509
you'll see that Luciano
legally entered the

18:03.533 --> 18:07.200
United States on
September 10, 1957, on foot.

18:07.833 --> 18:08.942
Can you imagine?

18:08.966 --> 18:12.942
LOPEZ: Wow.
He walked, that's crazy.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.709
GATES: He was living
in Tijuana at the time,

18:14.733 --> 18:16.976
so he likely crossed into
the United States through,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.076
the California
border town, San Ysidro,

18:20.100 --> 18:21.942
and by the time he swore
his oath of allegiance

18:21.966 --> 18:24.309
he'd been living in the
city for 12 years.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.933
LOPEZ: Oh wow.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.742
GATES: And you can see the
photo he submitted with his

18:28.766 --> 18:30.433
application there on your left.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.209
Does he look like
the guy you remember?

18:33.233 --> 18:34.909
LOPEZ: Yeah.
I can't wait to show my dad.

18:34.933 --> 18:36.809
GATES: Do you feel grateful
to your grandfather?

18:36.833 --> 18:38.876
If he hadn't tried so hard
to immigrate, you, of course,

18:38.900 --> 18:40.042
might not be here.

18:40.066 --> 18:41.176
LOPEZ: Of course.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.009
No, I, I appreciate, and I
just feel like going,

18:44.033 --> 18:45.842
uh, uh, down rabbit holes,

18:45.866 --> 18:47.242
just to kind of,
uh, even learn more,

18:47.266 --> 18:49.700
and-and anxious to show
the family, you know?

18:49.900 --> 18:52.100
But it does, you know,
makes you kind of proud.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.976
GATES: We now wanted
to see what we could learn

18:55.000 --> 18:57.942
about the history that
Mario's family left behind

18:57.966 --> 18:59.800
when they immigrated.

19:00.866 --> 19:03.576
Turning from
Luciano to his wife,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.142
Mario's grandmother
Alejandra Perez,

19:07.166 --> 19:08.900
we got more than
we bargained for.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.809
We were able to trace
Alejandra's roots back four

19:12.833 --> 19:15.466
generations in one area:

19:16.433 --> 19:19.276
The Mexican state of Zacatecas,

19:19.300 --> 19:23.133
uncovering a baptismal
record from the year 1817...

19:24.133 --> 19:25.509
LOPEZ: Wow.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.276
LOPEZ: How'd you get that?
That's amazing.

19:29.300 --> 19:34.609
"Solemnly baptized a Spaniard
of 7 days, Jose Prudenciano,

19:34.633 --> 19:36.676
born in Los Castañedas,

19:44.066 --> 19:46.142
LOPEZ: That my

grandfather's birth certificate?

19:47.400 --> 19:48.742
GATES: That is his
baptismal record.

19:48.766 --> 19:49.909
LOPEZ: Oh, and his baptism.

19:49.933 --> 19:52.209
So, wait, why are they
referring to him as a Spaniard?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.909
GATES: Would you
please turn the page?

19:53.933 --> 19:55.242
LOPEZ: Not a Mexican,
but a Spaniard.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.342
They didn't list you as Mexican.

19:56.366 --> 19:57.609
They either were
Spaniard or Native?

19:57.633 --> 19:59.109
GATES: Well, more
complicated than that.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.709
LOPEZ: Okay.

LOPEZ: No.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.976
GATES: This is what was
called a Casta painting.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.242
LOPEZ: Okay.

20:07.266 --> 20:09.176
GATES: Mario, it's a depiction
of the racial designation

20:09.200 --> 20:12.100
system instituted by the
Spanish in Colonial Mexico

20:12.566 --> 20:14.842
beginning in the 16th century.

20:14.866 --> 20:16.376
LOPEZ: So, they
would look at you and

20:16.400 --> 20:17.842
see where you fell into...?

20:17.866 --> 20:19.076
GATES: Yeah.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.200
LOPEZ: Wow. Unbelievable.

20:21.966 --> 20:24.866
GATES: Casta paintings may
seem shocking to modern eyes,

20:25.766 --> 20:28.800
but they provide a revealing
window onto the past,

20:29.866 --> 20:32.776
they were used to illustrate
the many ostensible "racial"

20:32.800 --> 20:35.100
differences among
colonial Mexicans,

20:36.533 --> 20:39.409
differences that were the
essential components of an

20:39.433 --> 20:43.742
emerging social order in a
land where Spanish, native,

20:43.766 --> 20:46.400
and African populations
were mingling...

20:48.733 --> 20:52.176
GATES: This particular
illustration shows and ranks

20:52.200 --> 20:56.142
subcategories within the caste
system that were created as a

20:56.166 --> 20:58.033
result of intermarriage...

20:58.500 --> 21:02.909
Intermarriage also meaning
just inter sexual relations,

21:02.933 --> 21:05.942
ranging from rape to actual,

21:05.966 --> 21:07.742
you know, love and marriage.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.176
LOPEZ: Yeah, whoa.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.742
GATES: And it produced
a mixed-race population.

21:10.766 --> 21:12.009
LOPEZ: Yeah.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.376
GATES: That was a lot more
complicated than just someone

21:13.400 --> 21:16.842
who looked like they had been
born in Madrid and someone who

21:16.866 --> 21:19.509
looked like they'd
been born in Zacatecas.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.609
LOPEZ: Right.

21:20.633 --> 21:23.809
GATES: So, the
Casta System had 16 categories

21:23.833 --> 21:25.109
of racial mixture.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.876
16!

21:26.900 --> 21:30.342
That means 16 shades of
Blackness or brownness.

21:30.366 --> 21:31.676
LOPEZ: Wow.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.709
GATES: Isn't that crazy?

21:32.733 --> 21:33.876
LOPEZ: Yeah.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.642
GATES: The three main
categories were, one, Spaniards,

21:36.666 --> 21:40.276
like your third
great-grandfather, Indios,

21:40.300 --> 21:42.276
who were the Indigenous
people of the Americas...

21:42.300 --> 21:43.776
LOPEZ: Yeah.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.776
GATES: And Negros, who were
the Black people from Africa.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.609
And you could see the
various color mixtures.

21:48.633 --> 21:49.709
LOPEZ: Yes.

21:49.733 --> 21:51.142
GATES: it was such
a crazy system,

21:51.166 --> 21:53.409
and they illustrated it
so that you could, like,

21:53.433 --> 21:55.476
I could look at you, and I go,

21:55.500 --> 21:58.100
"Mario, you're
in the, this caste."

21:58.333 --> 22:01.633
LOPEZ: Yeah. I'd fall
in about number five, right?

22:02.366 --> 22:03.609
GATES: Yeah. Yeah.
LOPEZ: Yeah.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.009
GATES: Isn't that?
LOPEZ: That's a trip.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.276
GATES: It is horrible, man.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.809
LOPEZ: And that
was important why?

22:07.833 --> 22:09.876
GATES: Because of racial purity.
LOPEZ: They just wanted to?

22:09.900 --> 22:11.409
GATES: Caste was class.

22:11.433 --> 22:12.476
LOPEZ: Yeah.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.009
GATES: A color was caste.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.276
Who was on top,
who was on bottom,

22:16.300 --> 22:17.876
just the nature of exploitation.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.900
LOPEZ: Unbelievable, yeah. Wow!

22:20.800 --> 22:23.609
GATES: Mario wondered how his
ancestors had ended up within

22:23.633 --> 22:26.466
this system in the first place.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.076
The answer would
transport us back into

22:30.100 --> 22:32.366
some terrible history...

22:32.966 --> 22:37.976
In 1546, Spanish explorers
discovered silver ore in the

22:38.000 --> 22:40.833
mountains surrounding Zacatecas.

22:41.733 --> 22:45.209
Soon, merchants and miners
were flocking to the region,

22:45.233 --> 22:48.909
and they would need
military force to subdue the

22:48.933 --> 22:52.366
native Americans who had
lived there for centuries.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.842
Mario's eleventh
great-grandfather,

22:56.866 --> 23:00.842
a Spaniard named
Baltasar Temiño de Bañuelos,

23:00.866 --> 23:03.700
was a part of that force...

23:04.200 --> 23:07.642
Baltasar likely arrived
in Mexico as a teenager,

23:07.666 --> 23:10.776
and ended up serving,
as a soldier of fortune in

23:10.800 --> 23:12.966
a brutal new economy.

23:14.066 --> 23:15.809
So, you raise the forces,
you go get the silver,

23:15.833 --> 23:19.076
subdue the Native Americans,
you keep the money.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.309
You know, it was
kind of like that.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.742
LOPEZ: Yeah.
How did they raise the money?

23:22.766 --> 23:23.776
GATES: This is the bad part.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.909
LOPEZ: Okay.

23:24.933 --> 23:26.909
GATES: Many used their
personal funds, of course,

23:26.933 --> 23:30.176
supplemented by capturing and
selling Indigenous people.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.542
LOPEZ: Really?

23:31.566 --> 23:32.543
GATES: Yeah.

23:32.567 --> 23:33.742
LOPEZ: So, the
Indigenous people are,

23:33.766 --> 23:35.009
just get taken and they're?

23:35.033 --> 23:36.509
GATES: They get taken and, yeah.
LOPEZ: Yeah.

23:36.533 --> 23:37.909
GATES: At the same time,

23:37.933 --> 23:39.876
Europe is quote-unquote
"discovering" Africa and

23:39.900 --> 23:41.776
enslaving Africans and
then bringing them over.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.876
LOPEZ: Got it.
GATES: One of the reasons...

23:42.900 --> 23:44.076
LOPEZ: So, it was like
almost simultaneous?

23:44.100 --> 23:45.276
GATES: Yes.
LOPEZ: Got it.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.676
GATES: And it was
all driven by...

23:46.700 --> 23:47.776
LOPEZ: Sure...

23:47.800 --> 23:49.142
GATES: I mean, it was
a really ugly business.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.833
LOPEZ: Yeah, I'd say.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.966
GATES: Baltasar was involved
in many "ugly" businesses,

23:55.966 --> 23:59.133
in addition to the military,
he also ran silver mines,

24:02.333 --> 24:04.976
and owned at least two mills,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.366
as well as a
silver ore refining plant.

24:08.866 --> 24:11.333
And that wasn't all he owned...

24:13.066 --> 24:14.576
GATES: Your ancestor,
I'm sorry to say,

24:14.600 --> 24:17.309
was one of the largest
slaveholder's in Zacatecas,

24:17.333 --> 24:21.576
he owned between 20 to 40
Indigenous Native American

24:21.600 --> 24:22.642
enslaved people...

24:22.666 --> 24:23.776
LOPEZ: Damn.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.500
GATES: And ten to 15
African enslaved people.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.242
How does learning
that make you feel?

24:30.266 --> 24:31.776
LOPEZ: I'm kind of speechless.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.176
I, I didn't, uh, obviously,

24:34.200 --> 24:36.276
I had no idea, but oh my god.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.576
GATES: It was horrible, man.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.042

24:39.066 --> 24:40.142
GATES: Oh yeah.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.809
LOPEZ: Oh my god.
Oh my god.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.109
We're so, that's unbelievable.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.776
GATES: No, imagine minding
your business in Zacatecas,

24:44.800 --> 24:46.042
and you look up, and
there are these white guys.

24:46.066 --> 24:47.509
You go, "Hey, should we
invite them to dinner?"

24:49.700 --> 24:51.933
LOPEZ: No. Right. Exactly. Damn.

GATES: Baltasar died sometime
around the year 1600,

24:58.433 --> 25:01.242
but his memory lived on.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.376
When the Spanish crown
recognized what would become

25:03.400 --> 25:06.933
the state of Zacatecas by
granting it a coat of arms,

25:09.433 --> 25:11.900
the design featured a
crowned female figure,

25:12.700 --> 25:15.042
flanked by the four men
who were thought to be the

25:15.066 --> 25:18.066
founders of the original
Spanish settlement.

25:19.633 --> 25:23.376
One of the four, the
man on the far left,

25:23.400 --> 25:26.566
is Mario's eleventh
great-grandfather...

25:29.833 --> 25:32.376
GATES: What do you
make of your ancestor?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.042
I mean, he was not
Abraham Lincoln.

LOPEZ: Right. Right.
I mean, you know, it's...

25:38.300 --> 25:41.242
That's oof.
It, I, it just...

25:41.266 --> 25:43.442
It's, it's hard to kind
of process all of it,

25:43.466 --> 25:46.076
and you know, there's no
justifying it other than that,

25:46.100 --> 25:48.142
I mean, that just,
it is what it was, right,

GATES: Oh, yeah.
LOPEZ: It's just so...

25:53.633 --> 25:54.876
When you take it back,
you're like,

how did society just
go about living?

26:04.033 --> 26:05.976
It was just so ruthless.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.366
Man, I'm just blessed

GATES: Like Mario,
Melissa Villaseñor came to me

26:14.533 --> 26:17.709
knowing that she had deep
roots in Mexico but wondering

26:17.733 --> 26:20.233
how her ancestors had
made the journey north.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.342
On her father's side,
our research soon focused on her

26:25.366 --> 26:29.266
great-grandmother, a
woman named Mercedes Muro.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.509
Mercedes was familiar to
Melissa because she's the

26:34.533 --> 26:38.209
mother of her grandmother
Carmen, who's been a constant,

26:38.233 --> 26:40.466
joyous presence in
Melissa's life...

26:42.866 --> 26:46.533
Yet Carmen never
spoke about her mother...

26:46.800 --> 26:49.366
In effect: Mercedes'
story had been lost.

26:50.633 --> 26:52.666
We set out to recover it...

26:53.233 --> 26:56.200
Starting with a birth
record from the year 1908...

26:57.466 --> 26:59.142
VILLASEÑOR:
"In Aguascalientes,

26:59.166 --> 27:00.909

VILLASEÑOR: Yes.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.076
VILLASEÑOR: That's crazy.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.576
(sighs)

27:38.600 --> 27:41.300
It's wild.
That's making me emotional.

27:43.300 --> 27:46.076
GATES: This record indicates
that Mercedes' father,

27:46.100 --> 27:50.609
Leobardo Muro, was a farmer
and we believe that her mother,

27:50.633 --> 27:52.709
Maria de la Torre,

27:52.733 --> 27:55.200
came from a farming
family as well.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.742
We know little about their
life together in Mexico,

27:59.766 --> 28:01.866
but it cannot have been easy...

28:02.800 --> 28:06.876
Most farmers in their
region ran small operations,

28:06.900 --> 28:10.709
leaving them at the mercy
of fluctuating prices not to

28:10.733 --> 28:13.400
mention the vagaries
of the weather,

28:14.066 --> 28:18.466
making each year a
struggle simply to survive.

28:19.633 --> 28:22.476
Sometime after 1910,

28:22.500 --> 28:25.642
the Muros decided to
abandon this struggle and

28:25.666 --> 28:29.366
moved to El Paso, Texas,
where wages were higher.

28:30.833 --> 28:34.109
Tragically, they were soon
confronted by a challenge even

28:34.133 --> 28:36.333
greater than
the lack of money...

28:36.633 --> 28:39.276
VILLASEÑOR: "Full name,
Maria de La Torre de Muro.

28:39.300 --> 28:43.733

28:55.100 --> 28:58.242
She died of cancer in
El Paso when she was just

28:58.266 --> 28:59.509
27 years old.

28:59.533 --> 29:00.909
VILLASEÑOR: Ohhhh.

29:00.933 --> 29:02.709
GATES: Your great-grandmother
Mercedes was five years old

29:02.733 --> 29:03.842
when she lost her mother.

29:03.866 --> 29:04.843
Did you have any idea?

29:04.867 --> 29:05.976
VILLASEÑOR: Unh-uh.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.842
GATES: Can you imagine?

29:07.866 --> 29:09.809
VILLASEÑOR: Poor girl.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.700
That's so sad.

29:13.566 --> 29:16.842
GATES: Mercedes' troubles
would soon be compounded.

29:16.866 --> 29:21.176
In 1917, her father
remarried and left her to be

29:21.200 --> 29:22.900
raised by her grandmother.

29:25.233 --> 29:28.909
She wasn't even ten
years old and effectively

29:28.933 --> 29:31.066
she'd lost both of her parents.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.376
Many people would have been
broken by the experience,

29:36.400 --> 29:38.300
but not Mercedes...

29:40.566 --> 29:44.233
We found her in the
1930 census for Arizona,

29:44.800 --> 29:48.376
starting a family with
Melissa's great-grandfather,

29:48.400 --> 29:51.166
Jesus de la Torre,
a railroad engineer...

29:54.566 --> 29:58.266
Unfortunately, their
happiness didn't last.

30:00.466 --> 30:04.709
Arizona was hit hard
by the great depression,

30:04.733 --> 30:08.042
and Mexican workers were
often the first fired as

30:08.066 --> 30:11.666
employers battled
to keep their businesses afloat.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.242
By the early 1930s,

30:15.266 --> 30:18.309
Mercedes and Jesus
had returned to Mexico,

30:18.333 --> 30:21.166
along with their three children.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.866
Then tragedy struck yet again.

30:26.166 --> 30:30.366
In November of 1934,
Jesus was shot dead,

30:31.266 --> 30:33.900
after standing up for
a friend at a party...

30:37.933 --> 30:39.709
VILLASEÑOR: "We were
all in a good mood

30:39.733 --> 30:41.509
when Heriberto arrived.

30:41.533 --> 30:43.576
He was wearing his
gun in plain sight,

30:43.600 --> 30:45.409
stuck into his belt.

30:45.433 --> 30:47.442
He started in on
one of my friends trying

30:47.466 --> 30:49.109
to humiliate him.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.509
That's when Jesus Maria
stepped in.

30:51.533 --> 30:54.009
Jesus Maria took three
steps toward him,

30:54.033 --> 30:55.609
ready for a fistfight.

30:55.633 --> 30:58.209
Heriberto surprised everyone
by pulling out the gun and

30:58.233 --> 31:02.909
making the first shot at
Jesus Maria's feet as a warning,

31:02.933 --> 31:05.309
but he didn't back off and
when he took the next step,

31:05.333 --> 31:07.976
Jesus got a bullet
to the thorax.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.676
And when he buckled over,
took two more in the back.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.033
There was nothing
that could be done."

31:14.533 --> 31:15.809
Oh, man.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.609
GATES: How do you think your
great-great-grandmother coped

31:17.633 --> 31:21.600
with so much loss in her life
at that age with three kids?

31:22.900 --> 31:25.700
VILLASEÑOR: I don't know,
but I'd be, I'd be a mess.

31:29.366 --> 31:33.442
GATES: Mercedes was 26
at the time of the murder.

31:33.466 --> 31:35.309
Her youngest daughter Carmen,

31:35.333 --> 31:38.333
Melissa's grandmother,
was just an infant.

31:39.566 --> 31:43.633
It's difficult even to imagine
how the family carried on,

31:44.233 --> 31:47.633
but it seems that carrying
on was Mercedes specialty.

31:49.666 --> 31:52.442
Mercedes would never remarry.

31:52.466 --> 31:56.209
Instead, she'd focus her efforts
on supporting her children,

31:56.233 --> 32:00.833
which, to her, meant leaving
her homeland once more...

32:04.100 --> 32:05.942
VILLASEÑOR:
"Mercedes Muro de la Torre.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.776
Passage paid by self.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.733
Purpose, reside
permanently." Wow.

32:11.266 --> 32:13.509
GATES: In 1947 when
she was 38 years old,

32:13.533 --> 32:15.976
Mercedes decided
to move permanently to

32:16.000 --> 32:17.276
the United States.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.609
VILLASEÑOR: Ah.

32:18.633 --> 32:20.676
GATES: She settled in LA where
her daughter Teresa lived and

32:20.700 --> 32:22.109
where we believe
your grandmother Carmen

32:22.133 --> 32:23.242
was also living.

32:23.266 --> 32:24.542
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah.

32:24.566 --> 32:27.176
GATES: We think Mercedes brought
Carmen into the United States

32:27.200 --> 32:31.533
sometime around 1944.

32:32.366 --> 32:37.200
VILLASEÑOR: That's awesome.
Ah. I like seeing that.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.209
GATES: Yeah, me too.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.876
I've got something
else cool to show you.

32:40.900 --> 32:41.877
Please turn the page.

32:41.901 --> 32:44.266
VILLASEÑOR: Okay. Wow.

32:46.266 --> 32:49.242
"Mercedes de La Torre was
admitted as a citizen of the

32:49.266 --> 32:52.376
United States of America
this seventh day of December

32:52.400 --> 32:55.676
in the year of our lord 1962."

32:55.700 --> 32:58.800
Whoa. Aww.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.933
Like, that, that was
everything for them.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.276
Like, for her to
get this probably was

33:07.300 --> 33:08.342
like the biggest...

33:08.366 --> 33:11.042
GATES: Totally.

33:11.066 --> 33:12.866
VILLASEÑOR: Wow.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.676
GATES: She became a citizen of
the United States of America

33:15.700 --> 33:17.709
on December 7, 1962,

33:17.733 --> 33:21.509
47 years after she first
came to this country,

33:21.533 --> 33:22.676
VILLASEÑOR: Mmm.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.677
GATES: And look
at that photograph.

33:23.701 --> 33:24.842
That's her.

33:24.866 --> 33:26.742
VILLASEÑOR: I know.

33:26.766 --> 33:29.209
I feel like she's, like,
giving a Mona Lisa-type smile

33:29.233 --> 33:30.876
where she wants to
smile but she's trying to

33:30.900 --> 33:32.900
keep her excitement in.

33:35.366 --> 33:38.342
GATES: In California,
Mercedes found work as a

33:38.366 --> 33:41.000
nurse's assistant at
a catholic hospital,

33:41.766 --> 33:44.676
and lived the rest of her
life, surrounded by family,

33:44.700 --> 33:46.800
in Los Angeles...

33:47.133 --> 33:49.942
Learning her story
drew Melissa closer to

33:49.966 --> 33:52.800
her grandmother Carmen,

33:53.033 --> 33:55.976
allowing her to appreciate
that Carmen, too,

33:56.000 --> 34:00.609
had endured a great deal and
had found a way to do more

34:00.633 --> 34:02.766
than simply survive.

34:04.633 --> 34:06.509
VILLASEÑOR: I feel like
with my grandma it's,

34:06.533 --> 34:09.500
she does anything for
us, for us grand kids.

34:09.833 --> 34:13.600
Like, she lets us
have all the fun.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.942
I don't know.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.776
I feel like maybe giving
extra love because of what

34:19.800 --> 34:21.800
she went through,
saw her mom go through.

34:22.366 --> 34:24.233
GATES: I'll bet.
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.242
GATES: What do you think
all these people would

34:26.266 --> 34:28.042
have made of you?

34:28.066 --> 34:29.309
VILLASEÑOR: First,
I think they'd be like,

34:29.333 --> 34:30.742
"Oh, look at this loony."

34:30.766 --> 34:35.242
But then, uh, but I
hope they're all watching

34:35.266 --> 34:37.042
and being and proud

34:37.066 --> 34:42.376
and, um, know that I'm very
grateful for them for carving

34:42.400 --> 34:44.433
such a great path for me.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.566
GATES: Mm-hmm.
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah.

34:48.433 --> 34:52.376
GATES: We'd already traced
Mario Lopez's paternal roots

34:52.400 --> 34:54.309
back five centuries,

34:54.333 --> 34:58.000
from southern California
to Mexico to Spain,

34:59.966 --> 35:02.276
a progression that
is not uncommon in

35:02.300 --> 35:04.566
Mexican American families.

35:05.666 --> 35:09.176
Now, turning to Mario's
mother's ancestry,

35:09.200 --> 35:13.466
we would find ourselves tracing
a far more unusual journey.

35:14.566 --> 35:17.609
It began in Mario's
childhood home,

35:17.633 --> 35:21.842
with his great-grandmother,
Soledad Alatorre,

35:21.866 --> 35:23.966
a beloved figure in his life...

35:26.933 --> 35:29.042
LOPEZ: She was awesome.
She used to, okay,

35:29.066 --> 35:32.476
so she had a little
bedroom, uh, that she,

35:32.500 --> 35:34.676
I don't know where she
kept her clothes, actually,

35:34.700 --> 35:36.576
because she took the
closet and converted it into

35:36.600 --> 35:38.809
like a little store because
she used to run a little store,

35:38.833 --> 35:39.942
I guess, back in Mexico.

35:39.966 --> 35:41.942
And she used to sell
candies and sodas and stuff

35:41.966 --> 35:43.109
outside of her window.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.909
GATES: Oh yeah?
LOPEZ: Out of her chair,

35:44.933 --> 35:46.009
yeah, to all the
kids in the neighborhood.

35:46.033 --> 35:47.242
So, she was like a little
businesswoman, and so...

35:47.266 --> 35:48.342
GATES: Oh, that's great.
LOPEZ: Yeah. Yeah.

35:48.366 --> 35:49.809
GATES: Hey, come on, come on.
LOPEZ: Yeah. No.

35:49.833 --> 35:51.242
All the kids would just
line up, and after school,

35:51.266 --> 35:53.076
they'd know, and so, she'd
have, she'd have uh, you know,

35:53.100 --> 35:54.976
sodas or candy and all that.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.009
I remember that specifically.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.176
GATES: Oh,
I think that's cool.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.409
LOPEZ: Yeah.
GATES: That's great.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.553
LOPEZ: Yeah. That was great.
She was a little hustler.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.542
GATES: Mario knew that
Soledad had immigrated to the

36:04.566 --> 36:07.800
United States in the
1950s along with her son,

36:08.800 --> 36:11.433
Mario's grandfather Rafael,

36:12.833 --> 36:16.542
and he knew that the two
came from Baja California Sur,

36:16.566 --> 36:19.633
the northernmost
state in Mexico.

36:20.500 --> 36:24.009
But beyond that, this part
of Mario's family tree was a

36:24.033 --> 36:25.733
blank slate.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.509
We began to fill it in,
starting with a man named

36:29.533 --> 36:34.100
Salomé Trasviña, Rafael's
father, and, for a time,

36:35.100 --> 36:37.133
Soledad's partner...

36:38.166 --> 36:41.276
LOPEZ: "In the City of
La Paz, Salomé Trasviña,

36:41.300 --> 36:44.009
of 27 years of age,
single, carpenter,

36:44.033 --> 36:45.809
native to this district,

36:45.833 --> 36:48.209
presented a child born the
day 24th of last October,

36:48.233 --> 36:51.909
who he named Rafael Trasviña,

36:51.933 --> 36:53.709
first natural son he
has had with his partner,

36:53.733 --> 36:55.176
Soledad Alatorre."

36:55.200 --> 36:57.576
GATES: That's your
grandfather's birth record.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.342
GATES: And as you can see,
Rafael was a natural child.

37:00.366 --> 37:01.676
You know what a
natural child is?

37:01.700 --> 37:02.876
LOPEZ: No? What is it?

37:02.900 --> 37:05.142
GATES: Out of wedlock.

37:05.166 --> 37:07.376
LOPEZ: Oh, so natural
child means out of wedlock?

37:07.400 --> 37:11.333
GATES: Salomé and Soledad were
not married when he was born.

37:11.766 --> 37:13.042
LOPEZ: Got it.

37:13.066 --> 37:14.642
First, oh, that's a, that's a,
that's a kind way to put it.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.909
GATES: Yeah, a natural child.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.042
LOPEZ: Oh, so they
say natural child.

37:19.066 --> 37:21.442
Has, is that a term used
just in Mexico or all over?

37:21.466 --> 37:22.576
GATES: Yeah. No, all over.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.176
There are, there are
different euphemisms in

37:24.200 --> 37:25.709
different countries,
at different times.

37:25.733 --> 37:27.476
LOPEZ: Because they did say
bastard at some point, right,

37:27.500 --> 37:28.642
which is much more harsh.

37:28.666 --> 37:30.009
GATES: Yeah, but they
wouldn't have probably put that

37:30.033 --> 37:31.010
on a legal document, right?

37:31.034 --> 37:32.176
LOPEZ: Got it.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.242
Well, never, never did
I think they'd put wetback,

37:33.266 --> 37:34.342
either, but so...

37:34.366 --> 37:35.542
GATES: No, no,
that's true, that's true.

37:35.566 --> 37:38.576
But Salomé and uh Soledad
weren't married when, uh,

37:38.600 --> 37:40.542
Rafael was born,
and in fact, they eventually,

37:40.566 --> 37:41.709
they split up.

37:41.733 --> 37:42.976
LOPEZ: Really?
GATES: Yes.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.233
LOPEZ: Oh wow.
I had no idea.

37:45.866 --> 37:49.076
GATES: As it turns out,
when Salomé left Soledad,

37:49.100 --> 37:53.842
he erased an entire branch
of Mario's family tree and,

37:53.866 --> 37:56.066
along with it, a
fascinating story...

37:58.266 --> 38:01.109
That story begins in 1917,

38:01.133 --> 38:04.242
five years before
Rafael's birth,

38:04.266 --> 38:07.600
with the arrival of a ship in
the port of San Francisco...

38:09.333 --> 38:13.200
on board was Salomé, and
he wasn't traveling alone...

38:15.766 --> 38:18.842
LOPEZ: "Salomé Trasviña,
22, carpenter,

38:18.866 --> 38:20.042
last permanent residence,

38:20.066 --> 38:21.442
La Paz, Mexico,

38:21.466 --> 38:26.100
Rodolfo Trasviña, 16, student,
Leonor Trasviña, 21, student."

38:27.200 --> 38:28.376
Who are those guys?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.876
GATES: There's your
great-grandfather, Salomé,

38:30.900 --> 38:34.266
landing in the United States
with his younger siblings.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.809
LOPEZ: Oh, those
are his siblings?

38:35.833 --> 38:36.909
Oh wow.

38:36.933 --> 38:39.166
GATES: Yes,
Rodolfo and Leonor.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.009
Did you have any idea that
your great-grandfather had

38:42.033 --> 38:43.876
been to the United States?

38:43.900 --> 38:46.633
LOPEZ: No. That's so random.
How and why?

38:47.166 --> 38:48.609
GATES: Your great...
LOPEZ: And why didn't he stay?

38:48.633 --> 38:50.200
GATES: Yeah!

38:50.600 --> 38:53.676
When Salomé and his siblings
arrived in San Francisco,

38:53.700 --> 38:56.100
the city was in need
of skilled laborers,

38:57.033 --> 38:58.842
but there was likely
another factor that had

38:58.866 --> 39:00.600
drawn them north:

39:01.400 --> 39:03.233
War.

39:04.133 --> 39:08.866
In 1910, a revolution
erupted in Mexico challenging

39:09.166 --> 39:12.400
the regime of
dictator Porfirio Díaz.

39:14.033 --> 39:17.342
The fighting intensified
over the following years,

39:17.366 --> 39:20.000
as various factions
battled for control.

39:22.666 --> 39:26.109
At its height, the war
stretched from coast to coast,

39:26.133 --> 39:31.242
and likely killed more
than half a million people...

39:31.266 --> 39:34.033
Many of them civilians.

39:34.766 --> 39:37.833
The unrest triggered
a mass migration,

39:38.200 --> 39:40.709
as about a quarter of a
million Mexicans sought refuge

39:40.733 --> 39:42.666
in the United States...

39:43.466 --> 39:46.766
Mario's ancestors
were among them.

39:47.733 --> 39:51.142
Salomé traveled for
nine days from La Paz to get

39:51.166 --> 39:54.276
to San Francisco,
more than 1,000 miles.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.342
LOPEZ: Oof.

39:55.366 --> 39:56.776
GATES: According to a
scholar we consulted,

39:56.800 --> 39:59.642
they likely traveled
by ship to avoid danger

39:59.666 --> 40:00.776
throughout Mexico.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.976
LOPEZ: Oh wow. Smart.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.642
GATES: And they arrived
in San Francisco well before

40:03.666 --> 40:05.642
most of the fighting
ended in 1920.

40:05.666 --> 40:06.976
LOPEZ: Got it. Okay.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.976
GATES: So, did you ever think
of your ancestors as refugees,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.109
fleeing a war?

40:10.133 --> 40:11.242
LOPEZ: No.

40:11.266 --> 40:12.976
GATES: But they did.
LOPEZ: That's kind of cool.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.209
GATES: It is very cool.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.176
It's not what we think of
Mexican immigration, right?

40:16.200 --> 40:18.233
LOPEZ: No.
In fact, I'm blown away.

40:19.233 --> 40:21.242
GATES: We believe Salomé
and his siblings were not

40:21.266 --> 40:23.709
just looking for
work in San Francisco,

40:23.733 --> 40:27.633
but rather a safe
place to settle,

40:27.966 --> 40:30.209
partly because soon
after they arrived,

40:30.233 --> 40:33.666
they did something unusual:
They sent for their parents.

40:35.966 --> 40:38.409
Indeed, within a month, Mario's

40:38.433 --> 40:42.442
great-great-grandparents
Epigmenio and Jesus Trasviña

40:42.466 --> 40:45.309
followed their children
to the city and,

40:45.333 --> 40:48.333
to all appearances,
started to put down roots...

40:51.033 --> 40:52.776
GATES: Ever see
that picture before?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.176
LOPEZ: Never in my life.
What am I looking at?

40:55.200 --> 40:57.142
GATES: That is the
Trasviña family.

40:57.166 --> 40:58.809
LOPEZ: That's the Trasviñas?

40:58.833 --> 41:01.166
GATES: 1910.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.976
That's your great-grandfather
Salomé and his parents.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.776
LOPEZ: Oh wow. Oh my gosh.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.776
Yeah. I can tell, wow,
this is, this is a trip.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.777
This is so cool.

41:11.801 --> 41:13.933
There's a dog there, even.

41:18.566 --> 41:20.642
GATES: The Trasviña family
may well have flourished in

41:20.666 --> 41:24.042
San Francisco,
but their story was about to

41:24.066 --> 41:26.133
take another twist...

41:27.933 --> 41:31.609
Within a decade, they
would all be back in Mexico...

41:31.633 --> 41:35.100
Driven, yet again, by forces
beyond their control...

41:36.866 --> 41:40.333
In 1918, a recession
hit the United States.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.976
The unemployment rate soared,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.833
and newcomers were
hit especially hard...

41:48.766 --> 41:51.309
GATES: About 20% of the
immigrants enumerated in the

41:51.333 --> 41:55.600
1920 census subsequently
lost their jobs.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.076
LOPEZ: Got it. Okay. Go it.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.809
GATES: So, meanwhile,
Mexico, ironically,

42:00.833 --> 42:02.976
was in the midst
of economic growth.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.676
LOPEZ: Wow. So, they went back.
You don't hear that often.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.709
GATES: No. You don't. No.
LOPEZ: You know? Uh...

42:07.733 --> 42:09.076
GATES: No.
It's a one-way ticket.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.342
LOPEZ: Yeah.

42:10.366 --> 42:11.609
And then and then, obviously,
my grandfather came back.

42:11.633 --> 42:12.676
GATES: Yeah.

42:12.700 --> 42:13.876
LOPEZ: So, yeah,
that's a trip.

42:13.900 --> 42:15.342
GATES: Constructing
your family tree,

42:15.366 --> 42:18.642
you have Spanish heritage that
comes to Mexico 500 years ago,

42:18.666 --> 42:21.542
and then, they live in
Mexico for 500 years, right?

42:21.566 --> 42:22.776
LOPEZ: Unbelievable.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.076
GATES: Then they come
to the United States.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.642
So, what does being
a Mexican American

42:26.666 --> 42:28.376
mean to you now?

42:28.400 --> 42:30.376
LOPEZ: That's a good question.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.842
I mean, I've always been proud
of my roots and my ethnicity,

42:33.866 --> 42:38.242
and, and, uh, I don't
think that that changes.

42:38.266 --> 42:40.976
But I love the knowledge
that I now have.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.242
GATES: Oh, that's good.

42:42.266 --> 42:44.809
LOPEZ: It's so incredibly
cool to get all this history.

42:44.833 --> 42:46.742
It makes me what to rush
home and tell my family,

42:46.766 --> 42:47.842
which I'm going to do.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.909
You know, I can't
appreciate it enough.

42:49.933 --> 42:52.300
And it makes me swell
with even more pride.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.976
GATES: We'd already traced
Melissa Villaseñor's paternal

42:57.000 --> 43:00.066
roots back to her
great-grandmother Mercedes,

43:01.033 --> 43:03.309
who spent decades
crisscrossing the border

43:03.333 --> 43:05.942
between the United States
and Mexico,

43:05.966 --> 43:09.466
enduring tumult and tragedy.

43:09.833 --> 43:13.109
Now, following another
line of her father's family,

43:13.133 --> 43:15.376
we came to an ancestor
who made a very different

43:15.400 --> 43:17.466
kind of journey...

43:18.000 --> 43:21.609
The story concerns
Diego Ochoa Garibay,

43:21.633 --> 43:24.966
a man who died around
the year 1620 in Zamora,

43:26.166 --> 43:29.466
a city in western Mexico...

43:30.000 --> 43:31.242
GATES: You have never
heard of this guy.

43:31.266 --> 43:32.342
VILLASEÑOR: No.

43:32.366 --> 43:34.409
GATES: You just met your
12th great-grandfather.

43:34.433 --> 43:35.442
VILLASEÑOR: Geez...

43:35.466 --> 43:37.409
GATES: Your
great-great-great-great-great-

43:37.433 --> 43:40.433
great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather.

43:40.633 --> 43:42.509
Did you ever in your
wildest dreams think we could

43:42.533 --> 43:43.576
go back this far?

43:43.600 --> 43:45.042
VILLASEÑOR: Twelve? No!

43:45.066 --> 43:47.233
GATES: And look at
that map on your left.

43:48.133 --> 43:49.776
That is Zamora.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.009
VILLASEÑOR: Mmmm.

43:51.033 --> 43:53.876
GATES: Melissa, your
roots there go back at least

43:53.900 --> 43:56.609
392 years.

43:56.633 --> 43:59.966
VILLASEÑOR:
This is, this is amazing.

44:02.666 --> 44:05.042
GATES: According to records
held by the Catholic church

44:05.066 --> 44:07.276
in Zamora,

44:07.300 --> 44:09.942
Melissa's 12th
great-grandfather Diego came

44:09.966 --> 44:12.733
from a family of
low-level nobility,

44:13.333 --> 44:15.976
a family that originally
hailed from what was known as

44:16.000 --> 44:18.600
"the lordship of Biscay",

44:19.033 --> 44:22.000
which is now part of the
Basque region of Spain...

44:22.733 --> 44:23.976
VILLASEÑOR: Basque Country.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.109
GATES: Yeah.

44:25.133 --> 44:26.442
That is where your
Spanish ancestors, I mean,

44:26.466 --> 44:28.276
have you ever wondered where
in Spain you came from?

44:28.300 --> 44:29.309
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.909
GATES: That's where
you come from.

44:30.933 --> 44:33.209
VILLASEÑOR: Biscay.
GATES: Yeah.

44:33.233 --> 44:35.200
VILLASEÑOR: I'm Basque, baby.

44:36.466 --> 44:38.533
I, I want to shout it
from the mountaintops.

44:39.233 --> 44:41.042
GATES: Well, there are a lot
of mountains up there too,

44:41.066 --> 44:42.176
to shout from.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.133
VILLASEÑOR: That's so cool.

44:45.033 --> 44:48.476
GATES: We know nothing about the
circumstances of Diego's birth,

44:48.500 --> 44:51.666
but we have a very good idea
of how he ended up in Zamora.

44:54.133 --> 44:57.042
Just as we'd seen on
Mario's family's tree,

44:57.066 --> 45:01.033
Melissa's ancestor
came to conquer...

45:01.266 --> 45:06.633
Records place him in western
Mexico around the year 1570.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.642
At the time, of course,

45:09.666 --> 45:13.076
the land belonged
to its indigenous owners,

45:13.100 --> 45:15.609
but their numbers were
dropping precipitously as the

45:15.633 --> 45:19.800
Spanish engaged in what
they called "pacification"

45:20.366 --> 45:23.666
a polite term for genocidal war.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.242
It is estimated that over
6 million native people were

45:28.266 --> 45:31.533
living in Mexico in 1545...

45:32.600 --> 45:37.476
But by 1570, more than
half of them would be dead.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.109
VILLASEÑOR: Mm.

45:39.133 --> 45:40.276
GATES: So...

45:40.300 --> 45:41.676
VILLASEÑOR:
That's a lot of battles.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.276
GATES: That's what
"pacification" meant.

45:43.300 --> 45:44.842
(Villaseñor sighs).

45:44.866 --> 45:47.842
You know, brutal warfare
against the Native Americans.

45:47.866 --> 45:49.976
VILLASEÑOR:
Oh, now I feel bad.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.276
GATES: Guilt is not heritable.

45:51.300 --> 45:54.409
What your ancestors
did is not on you,

45:54.433 --> 45:56.609
but it's important to find
out what they did, right?

45:56.633 --> 45:57.909
VILLASEÑOR: Yes. Yes. Yes.

45:57.933 --> 45:59.176
GATES: Would you
please turn the page?

45:59.200 --> 46:00.442
VILLASEÑOR: Yes.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.909
GATES: Would you please
read the translated section?

46:01.933 --> 46:03.409
VILLASEÑOR: Yes.

46:03.433 --> 46:05.509
"Captain Diego
Ochoa Garibay..."

46:05.533 --> 46:06.676
GATES: Mm-hmm.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.576
VILLASEÑOR: "Who did render
great and considerable

46:08.600 --> 46:12.666
services to his Majesty,
subduing the Chichimeca..."

46:13.300 --> 46:14.509
GATES: Yeah.

46:14.533 --> 46:16.509
VILLASEÑOR: "Indians, bringing
them to the light of our

46:16.533 --> 46:20.476
Holy Faith, having a great
many of them baptized and

46:20.500 --> 46:23.109
administering to them
the Holy Sacraments,

46:23.133 --> 46:25.209
whose zeal was notorious,

46:25.233 --> 46:28.009
and among the many
services Diego rendered

46:28.033 --> 46:31.109
at his own expense and
at risk of his life was an

46:31.133 --> 46:34.442
occasion when the
Chichimeca Indians,

46:34.466 --> 46:37.942
having robbed the Cathedral
of Guadalajara and not left

46:37.966 --> 46:41.242
behind a single ornament
or item of silver,

46:41.266 --> 46:44.376
he chased after them and
recovered everything stolen

46:44.400 --> 46:48.109
from the said church with
which action His Majesty was

46:48.133 --> 46:49.942
well pleased."

46:49.966 --> 46:53.076
GATES: So, Spain was sending
the Roman Catholic Church

46:53.100 --> 46:57.109
and conquistadors
with guns and superior arms

46:57.133 --> 47:02.442
to claim this land
for Spain because they had

47:02.466 --> 47:03.976
a lot of gold and silver.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.309
VILLASEÑOR: Right.

47:05.333 --> 47:08.242
GATES: They used as an
excuse the fact that the

47:08.266 --> 47:10.909
Native Americans didn't
believe in Christianity.

47:10.933 --> 47:12.309
And they said,

47:12.333 --> 47:14.442
"Well, these are heathens,
they're savages,

47:14.466 --> 47:16.642
so we're going to conquer
them and Christianize them,

47:16.666 --> 47:17.909
we're going to civilize them."

47:17.933 --> 47:19.109
VILLASEÑOR: Ah.

47:19.133 --> 47:20.776
GATES: But in civilizing
them, quote-unquote...

47:20.800 --> 47:22.009
VILLASEÑOR: Meant kill.

47:22.033 --> 47:23.676
GATES: It meant
killing them, subduing them,

47:23.700 --> 47:25.709
converting them,
taking them away from

47:25.733 --> 47:27.042
their traditional culture.

47:27.066 --> 47:28.176
VILLASEÑOR: Mmm.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.276
GATES: And their ownership
of their own gold

47:30.300 --> 47:33.376
and silver mines.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.266
VILLASEÑOR: That's a lot.

47:37.666 --> 47:39.709
GATES: We believe
that Melissa's 12th

47:39.733 --> 47:42.176
great-grandfather
participated in what is known

47:42.200 --> 47:44.466
as the Chichimeca War,

47:45.200 --> 47:50.300
an intensely violent conflict
that lasted for roughly 40 years

47:51.733 --> 47:55.042
and ended
with Spain in control of much

47:55.066 --> 47:57.866
of north and
west-central Mexico.

48:00.700 --> 48:04.809
After the war,
Diego settled in Zamora,

48:04.833 --> 48:07.209
where we uncovered
another discomfiting

48:07.233 --> 48:09.533
detail about his life:

48:10.300 --> 48:14.142
A baptismal record for the
son of a woman named Maria,

48:14.166 --> 48:17.133
who was one of
Diego's African slaves...

48:19.400 --> 48:21.076
VILLASEÑOR: Ohhh...

48:21.100 --> 48:23.742
GATES: So, Diego is
not only a conquistador,

48:23.766 --> 48:26.109
he was also a slave owner.

48:26.133 --> 48:29.109
(groans and sighs).

48:29.133 --> 48:30.709
VILLASEÑOR: Wow.

48:30.733 --> 48:32.176
GATES: Most Americans,
I would say,

48:32.200 --> 48:34.309
don't know that lots of
Africans were brought to

48:34.333 --> 48:37.476
Mexico by the Spanish
in the slave trade.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.876
VILLASEÑOR: Yeah.

48:38.900 --> 48:40.876
GATES: And your twelfth
great-grandfather owned a

48:40.900 --> 48:43.609
black woman named Maria.

48:43.633 --> 48:45.176
GATES: Did you ever imagine?

48:45.200 --> 48:48.166
VILLASEÑOR: Woof. No.

48:49.700 --> 48:52.333
GATES: Diego's life is
sobering to contemplate,

48:53.333 --> 48:55.676
but he is by no means the
only member of Melissa's

48:55.700 --> 48:59.066
family who lived
through these awful years.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.242
She has dozens of
ancestors who witnessed

49:03.266 --> 49:05.300
the Spanish conquest,

49:05.533 --> 49:08.266
and not all of them
were from Spain...

49:09.500 --> 49:12.966
The evidence for this lies
in Melissa's own chromosomes:

49:13.666 --> 49:15.942
We gave her an admixture test,

49:15.966 --> 49:18.909
which reveals a
person's ancestry over

49:18.933 --> 49:21.266
approximately the
last 500 years,

49:22.666 --> 49:25.776
broken down into percentages
based on the broad regions

49:25.800 --> 49:27.633
where their ancestors lived...

49:29.666 --> 49:32.076
GATES: Can you read
out your percentages?

49:32.100 --> 49:35.700
VILLASEÑOR: Oh.
Okay, 64% European.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.042
GATES: Yeah.

49:37.066 --> 49:38.709
VILLASEÑOR: 34%
Indigenous Mexican.

49:38.733 --> 49:40.442
GATES: How 'bout that?

49:40.466 --> 49:43.566
You have a lot of Native
American ancestry, Melissa.

49:43.966 --> 49:45.009
VILLASEÑOR: Hell, yeah.

49:45.033 --> 49:47.242
GATES: A lot.
VILLASEÑOR: Cool.

49:47.266 --> 49:49.142
GATES: You know, you
are a third indigenous,

49:49.166 --> 49:50.542
a third Native American.

49:50.566 --> 49:51.742
VILLASEÑOR: Whoa.

49:51.766 --> 49:52.776
GATES: Yeah.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.076
VILLASEÑOR: Beautiful.

49:54.100 --> 49:56.176
GATES: You ever think of
yourself as an indigenous woman?

49:56.200 --> 49:58.642
VILLASEÑOR: Hmm. No.

49:58.666 --> 49:59.676
GATES: No.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.933
VILLASEÑOR:
But, but I, I love that.

50:03.666 --> 50:07.376
GATES: Melissa's DNA also
revealed that she is 2%

50:07.400 --> 50:10.642
sub-Saharan African,
reflecting yet another

50:10.666 --> 50:13.966
dimension of Mexico's
complex past...

50:14.833 --> 50:17.909
And turning from
her DNA to Mario's,

50:17.933 --> 50:20.233
we wondered if we would see
the same level of diversity...

50:22.233 --> 50:24.166
We were not disappointed.

50:24.900 --> 50:29.666
Mario is 56% European,
41% indigenous American,

50:30.900 --> 50:33.733
and 3% sub-Saharan African.

50:34.233 --> 50:35.642
LOPEZ: Look at that!

50:35.666 --> 50:37.376
GATES: So, your paper trail
told us you descend from

50:37.400 --> 50:41.376
Spaniards who conquered, uh,
Native Americans in Mexico.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.409
LOPEZ: Uh-huh.

50:42.433 --> 50:43.876
GATES: And your DNA is
telling us that you also

50:43.900 --> 50:46.442
descend from the
people whom they conquered.

50:46.466 --> 50:48.176
So, there was intermixing.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.509
LOPEZ: So, they hooked up?
GATES: Yeah.

50:50.533 --> 50:51.809
LOPEZ: Yeah.
So, they hooked up.

50:51.833 --> 50:54.209
GATES: Look, most of the
conquistadors were men.

50:54.233 --> 50:55.442
LOPEZ: Yeah.

50:55.466 --> 50:56.909
GATES: So, in any society,
when there are a lot of men,

50:56.933 --> 50:58.342
they will take as wives...

50:58.366 --> 50:59.376
LOPEZ: Yeah.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.609
GATES: First of all,
there's, there's rape.

51:00.633 --> 51:02.342
I don't want to
romanticize this.

51:02.366 --> 51:03.442
LOPEZ: Sure.

51:03.466 --> 51:04.709
GATES: From war and conquest.

51:04.733 --> 51:05.976
LOPEZ: Right.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.442
GATES: But there would be
stable relationships, as well,

51:08.466 --> 51:09.842
between people
of European descent and

51:09.866 --> 51:10.876
Native American women.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.142
LOPEZ: Got it. Yes.

51:12.166 --> 51:16.400
All this, it's, it's sort
of mind-blowing actually.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.709
GATES: We were now nearing
the end of our journey

51:22.733 --> 51:25.209
with Mario and Melissa.

51:25.233 --> 51:28.076
It was time to give them
their full family trees...

51:28.100 --> 51:30.209
LOPEZ: This is the
coolest thing ever.

51:30.233 --> 51:31.409
This is the best gift ever.

51:31.433 --> 51:32.776
Thank you so much.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.609
GATES: Revealing
how their roots,

51:34.633 --> 51:36.376
both in Mexico and in Spain,

51:36.400 --> 51:38.109
stretch back centuries...

51:38.133 --> 51:39.142
(sighs).

51:39.166 --> 51:40.742
GATES: Melissa,
this is your family tree.

51:40.766 --> 51:42.800
VILLASEÑOR: Oh my gosh.

51:45.200 --> 51:48.209
Oh, that's so cool.

51:48.233 --> 51:50.609
I don't know why I'm
in tears, but this is just,

51:50.633 --> 51:54.000
it's just crazy to
see them all here.

51:54.233 --> 51:57.133
This is, this has
been a beautiful day.

51:57.733 --> 52:00.342
GATES: That's the end of our
search for the ancestors of

52:00.366 --> 52:04.466
Mario Lopez and
Melissa Villaseñor.

52:05.266 --> 52:09.076
Join me next time as we unlock
the secrets of the past for

52:09.100 --> 52:11.942
new guests on another episode of

52:11.966 --> 52:14.133
"Finding Your Roots".
