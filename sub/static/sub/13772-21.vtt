00:05.788 --> 00:07.485
Man, I hate finals.

00:07.572 --> 00:08.921
I was up all night studying.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.706
Not me, I slept like a baby.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.013
What are you doing?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.231
Just making sure
I know the answers

00:14.318 --> 00:16.712
for my history test today.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.801
There's more than one way
to be a genius, Malcolm.

Hey, Dewey, what
have you got there?

01:05.761 --> 01:07.197
I have to do an autobiography
for my English class,

01:07.284 --> 01:08.764
and my teacher
wants me to include

01:08.851 --> 01:10.157
a few pictures
from my early childhood.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.375
Well, it looks like you have

01:11.462 --> 01:12.768
-a lot to choose from.
-Yeah.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.596
You guys really did
a great job with Francis...

01:15.945 --> 01:17.338
And Reese...

01:18.817 --> 01:20.210
And Malcolm.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.301
Now why don't we take a look at
a few of my precious memories.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.964
Uh! Spider.

01:35.051 --> 01:35.921
There.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.446
Now we have thatmemory.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.578
Would you stop feeling
sorry for yourself,

01:40.665 --> 01:42.667
there must be hundreds
of pictures of you in here.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.584
[sighs]

01:48.847 --> 01:50.588
Oh!

01:50.675 --> 01:52.677
Well, here is poor,
neglected Dewey

01:52.764 --> 01:54.592
having great time at SeaWorld.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.594
It's so blurry, you can't
even tell that's me.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.118
Well, you can't prove it's not.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
Dewey, at least
we got you a memory book.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.164
That's more than
we've done for Jamie.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.731
And I suppose
that makes you feel

02:02.818 --> 02:03.993
pretty good about yourselves.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.386
You want to know the truth?

02:05.473 --> 02:06.778
You were the fourth child.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.215
By the time you came around,

02:08.301 --> 02:09.607
this house was in a state
of complete chaos.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.261
The only sleep I got was when

02:11.348 --> 02:12.828
I'd nod off on
the drive to work.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.656
So forgive us if
we didn't get a chance

02:14.743 --> 02:15.744
to take every picture,
every video,

02:15.831 --> 02:17.049
or get you every vaccination.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.182
-I wasn't vaccinated?
-Tell you what, Dewey.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.618
You get whooping cough,

02:20.705 --> 02:21.663
I promise I'll take
a ton of pictures.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.279
You won't believe it--

02:29.366 --> 02:31.673
I just got asked to the prom
by Nick Tompkins!

02:31.760 --> 02:33.327
[squealing]

02:33.414 --> 02:36.417
Oh, great,
it's prom time already.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.245
An evening of posers and phonies

02:38.332 --> 02:40.377
out to make the rest of us
feel like crap.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.162
It's just like every other day
of high school,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
except it costs
a thousand dollars.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.556
That's inspired.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.731
"A Night To Cherish"?

02:46.818 --> 02:48.037
It makes last year's

02:48.124 --> 02:50.387
"A Night To Remember"
seem so shallow.

02:50.474 --> 02:51.388
GIRL: Yeah, I wouldn't expect

02:51.475 --> 02:52.781
you to show up, anyway, Carla.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.739
You'll probably be home
alone in your room,

02:54.826 --> 02:56.959
listening to Morrissey
and gouging out the eyes

02:57.046 --> 02:58.439
of models in Voguemagazine.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.181
Aw, does this mean we're not
best friends anymore?

03:05.359 --> 03:06.229
That was great.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.491
You're Carla, right?

03:07.578 --> 03:08.623
The one who read
the phone book out loud

03:08.710 --> 03:10.190
-at the talent show.
-Yeah.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.887
I was surprised they let me get
all the way to the B's.

03:13.628 --> 03:14.672
You know what sucks
about this school?

03:14.759 --> 03:17.327
Students, teachers,
the textbooks,

03:17.414 --> 03:18.763
the asbestos-filled building

03:18.850 --> 03:20.374
and the toxic dump
it's built on?

03:20.461 --> 03:23.159
Well, that,
plus they never offer

03:23.246 --> 03:24.682
anything for people
like us to do.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.901
You know what would be cool?

03:25.988 --> 03:27.337
If there was a party

03:27.424 --> 03:29.165
that was the complete
opposite of the prom.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.385
-You mean like a "morp."
-What?

03:31.472 --> 03:33.082
A morp-- the complete
opposite of the prom.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.563
Morp. I like that.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.782
Yeah, instead of paying
$500 for a dress,

03:37.869 --> 03:39.523
we could just wear jeans
and a sweatshirt.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.525
And instead of a limo,
we can all just take the bus.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.179
We should totally do this.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.225
-Can I get your number?
-Sure.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.753
It wasn't me who threw
that pudding at you!

03:51.840 --> 03:53.102
Well, you should have
thought of that

03:53.189 --> 03:54.712
before you started looking
like the guy who did!

03:54.799 --> 03:57.280
-[groaning]
-Excuse me?

03:57.367 --> 03:59.108
You're Reese, aren't you?

03:59.195 --> 04:00.283
Wait a second, I'm in
the middle of something.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.116
Don't worry,
somebody will find you;

04:07.203 --> 04:08.770
they do drug searches
on Fridays.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.858
Okay, what?

04:09.945 --> 04:11.425
What are you doing prom night?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.078
That's a Saturday.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.950
I'll be throwing shopping carts
into the reservoir.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.473
My name is Jeanie.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.692
For the past four years,
I've been super-focused

04:17.779 --> 04:19.433
on keeping a perfect GPA.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.348
But now that I've got my
acceptance letter from Brown,

04:21.435 --> 04:22.610
I feel like I've got
some time to experience

04:22.697 --> 04:23.959
high school social life.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.787
So I want you
to take me to the prom.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.180
Yeah... that sounds
like a fun night,

04:28.268 --> 04:30.357
except the next morning
I wake up like an idiot

04:30.444 --> 04:31.619
with no shopping carts
in the reservoir.

04:31.706 --> 04:32.794
I'll pay you $200.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.665
Two hundred dollars?!

04:34.752 --> 04:36.363
Just to go out on a date?

04:36.450 --> 04:39.017
And the career counselor said
I should be a mechanic.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.715
I can't wait to throw
this in his face.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.197
Yeah...

04:45.285 --> 04:46.851
you're basically a tear down,

04:46.938 --> 04:48.940
but I think I can get you ready.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.028
Meet me here tomorrow at 3:00.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.162
How sweet is this?

04:53.249 --> 04:54.468
KID [in locker]:
I think she likes you.

04:54.555 --> 04:55.512
Ow!

04:58.210 --> 05:00.648
You know, I felt pretty bad

05:00.735 --> 05:02.519
after our little conversation
the other day.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.870
So, I did a little poking around
the garage myself,

05:05.957 --> 05:08.046
and you'll never guess
what I found.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.181
Dewey's artwork.

05:13.835 --> 05:14.705
Kindergarten, first grade.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.533
Ooh, look, art camp.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.795
It's all here.

05:17.882 --> 05:21.712
Sorry, Dad, I don't
know what to say.

05:21.799 --> 05:24.324
Wait a minute, here's a drawing
I did of Grandma.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.238
And it's beautiful.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.718
You did a really nice job
with her whiskey bottle.

05:27.805 --> 05:31.505
I also have her missing a leg.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.985
Interesting, since she didn't
lose it until last year.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.729
Dewey, if you're
trying to tell me

05:38.816 --> 05:40.470
that you can predict
the future...

05:40.557 --> 05:41.776
So you're neglectful,
andyou think I'm an idiot.

05:41.863 --> 05:42.864
That's nice.

05:44.648 --> 05:48.130
I-I spent over an hour
on this rainbow, Dewey!

05:50.045 --> 05:52.439
You're not an easy boy to love,
you know!

05:53.962 --> 05:55.659
Thanks for coming
to the meeting.

05:55.746 --> 05:59.446
This morp of ours is going
to blow those prom zombies away.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.186
Do we have to call it a meeting?

06:01.273 --> 06:02.971
That sounds like something the
dance committee would call it.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.625
Okay, you're totally right,
this isn't a meeting.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.105
But I still think that we need
to have some sort of plan.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.846
Hey, how crazy is this?

06:08.933 --> 06:10.848
So you know how everyone wears
formal clothes the prom, right?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.023
So how about

06:12.110 --> 06:15.723
if we all went naked?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.507
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

06:17.594 --> 06:18.726
Can we go naked?

06:18.813 --> 06:19.857
No.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.250
Here we go.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.860
King Malcolm handing down
his rules

06:22.947 --> 06:24.122
from the mountaintop.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.602
Will there be uniforms?

06:25.689 --> 06:26.908
Little flags with your picture
on them?

06:26.995 --> 06:28.823
A.J., you moron, the can drive

06:28.910 --> 06:30.477
was not a fascist conspiracy,

06:30.564 --> 06:31.434
and neither is this.

06:31.521 --> 06:32.609
Oh, my God.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.003
The backbiting,
the name-calling--

06:35.090 --> 06:36.961
-this is just like French club!
-A.J.: Exactly.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.702
This is turning out like
every other school event.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.791
We got some weasly tyrant
pushing everybody around.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.140
The scared masses.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.620
A poet willing
to speak the truth.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.795
I say we should all be free

06:44.882 --> 06:46.449
to make our own
anti-prom statement.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.495
And each of us choose our
own location to do it in.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.540
In other words, we all
stay home on prom night

06:50.627 --> 06:51.715
like we do every year?

06:51.802 --> 06:53.935
Hmm, that'll send a message.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.197
Look, guys,

06:55.284 --> 06:56.938
the morp is too good of an idea

06:57.025 --> 06:58.461
to let personality conflicts
get in the way.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.680
We have been outsiders

06:59.767 --> 07:01.551
that have never
belonged to anything.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.945
And now, for one night,
we can be a part of something.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.555
And do it in a way
that allows us

07:05.642 --> 07:06.469
to all to be individuals.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.472
Malcolm's right.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.430
Let's make this happen.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.215
I have an idea for refreshments.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.086
What if we get a big punch bowl,

07:15.173 --> 07:17.480
and then we all drink punch.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.614
You know, ironically.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.311
I guess I could write
our manifesto.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.443
I've already got
the first 1,500 pages.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.661
That's great.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.010
And I'll arrange for us to use

07:26.097 --> 07:27.359
the boiler room in the basement.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.839
The only problem is,
it's full of desks.

07:28.926 --> 07:29.753
We'll have to move
all those out.

07:29.840 --> 07:30.798
Who's got Friday night open?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.846
Let's review the evening.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.457
What time do you pick me up?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.328
I ring your doorbell at 6:00.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.417
I'm prompt because
it's a sign of respect.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.592
And when you get to my house...

07:42.679 --> 07:43.811
I know.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.203
No throwing eggs at the door.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.031
Also a sign of respect.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.163
And when we're at the dance,

07:48.250 --> 07:49.077
and it's time to say
something nice,

07:49.164 --> 07:51.471
what do you say?

07:51.558 --> 07:53.777
I don't know,
"Thanks for shaving?"

07:53.864 --> 07:54.952
-Ow!
-We went over this!

07:55.039 --> 07:57.172
Right, right, right. Um...

07:57.259 --> 07:59.522
"Every time I look at you you
somehow become more beautiful."

07:59.609 --> 08:00.697
[timer goes off]

08:00.784 --> 08:02.003
His teeth are done.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.051
They're not white enough.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.313
Don't you people realize

08:08.400 --> 08:09.880
that we're running
out of time here?

08:09.967 --> 08:10.925
Look at this.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.492
He's not even close.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.450
I want his face flawless,
his hair shorter

08:14.537 --> 08:15.669
and shinier.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.453
He's an illiterate thug.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.281
I don't think it's too much
to ask that he looks perfect!

08:21.631 --> 08:23.154
You heard the lady.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.373
Make me glow.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.636
Lois!

08:26.723 --> 08:27.942
I don't want to alarm you,

08:28.029 --> 08:30.335
but there is a naked man
in your house!

08:30.422 --> 08:31.685
LOIS: What took you so long?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.513
The boys left for the prom
a half hour ago.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.166
Yeah, I know, I got a flat tire

08:35.253 --> 08:37.081
on my way to Jamie's babysitter.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.344
I had to drive back on the rim.

08:39.431 --> 08:40.736
There were a lot of sparks,

08:40.823 --> 08:41.782
but I don't think
anything caught fire.

08:43.871 --> 08:44.524
The main thing is that
you and I have...

08:44.611 --> 08:45.612
[shrieks]

08:45.699 --> 08:47.570
Dewey! What are you doing here?

08:47.657 --> 08:49.093
I live here.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.355
Honey, Dewey's here!

08:50.442 --> 08:51.705
LOIS: What's he doing here?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.141
Don't you have a prom to go to?

08:53.228 --> 08:54.316
I'm not in high school.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.927
He says he's not in high school!

08:57.014 --> 08:58.929
LOIS: Oh, for God sakes,
Hal, we're just

08:59.016 --> 09:00.496
-going to have
to take a raincheck.
-No!

09:00.583 --> 09:01.453
Okay, look, I'm very sorry,

09:01.541 --> 09:02.933
but you got to get out of here.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.240
What? But I'm researching
a history report on-line.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.633
If it's money you want,
you got it.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.200
Here, you ought to be able

09:09.287 --> 09:10.201
to have a good time with that.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.423
You can go to a movie,
grab a burger.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.685
Hey, the Hyatt has a piano bar.

09:15.772 --> 09:16.817
But I don't have any shoes.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.645
Buy some! I love you, son.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.081
Listen, maybe we'll go
to the zoo sometime, huh?

09:20.168 --> 09:21.561
Just you and me!

09:32.397 --> 09:34.574
Wow. Quite a turnout.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.879
Yeah.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.621
We even got three
home-schooled kids.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.842
Here, Carla, hey, Malcolm.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.278
Have some punch.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.888
There's nothing in here.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.498
I know.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.848
It's a statement about
how completely empty

09:47.935 --> 09:49.023
the real prom experience is.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.895
The cookies are just cookies.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.897
I love your wrist corsage.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.030
Yeah. I found it
in the crisper drawer.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.074
Good job, guys.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.336
This sucks the least

09:58.423 --> 09:59.903
of anything I've ever done
in my life.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.036
I met a guy here who hates
Starbucks more than I do.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.301
This is fantastic, Malcolm.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.216
All these people would have
been home tonight

10:08.303 --> 10:09.521
feeling lonely and miserable.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
You should feel really proud.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.177
Yeah, I guess.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.570
What do you mean "you guess"?

10:14.657 --> 10:17.573
I know, I know, it just...

10:17.660 --> 10:19.357
I thought it would feel better.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.532
There's something missing.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.361
I didn't see
the schedule of events.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.712
What time is everyone
going to nude up?

10:30.194 --> 10:31.456
I just have to come out
and say it.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.371
[panting]

10:33.458 --> 10:36.853
I was incredible,
and you were no slouch yourself.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.072
I'm the lucky one, Hal.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.204
All I had to do was show up.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.513
Did you hear the phone ring?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.254
Hal, I couldn't have heard
the space shuttle land.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.908
[machine beeps]

10:47.995 --> 10:49.866
DEWEY:
Hi. This is Dewey.
Remember me?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.347
Your fourth son?

10:52.434 --> 10:54.349
Now, I don't expect you
to miss me,

10:54.436 --> 10:56.873
but at some point, Dad,
you may miss

10:56.960 --> 10:58.788
the wallet you threw at me.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.964
You gave him your wallet?!

11:01.051 --> 11:03.358
So here's the deal:
If you'd like to see all your

11:03.445 --> 11:05.055
money and credit cards
again...

11:05.142 --> 11:07.405
Wait a minute. That bell
ringing in the background.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.277
I know I've heard
that before!

11:09.364 --> 11:11.453
So here's the deal: If you'd
like to see all your...

11:11.540 --> 11:12.846
That is Saint Matthew's.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.195
No, wait.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.675
Saint Luke's on Third.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.894
It's definitely
a Lutheran bell.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.462
...if you'd like to see
all your money
and credit cards again,

11:20.549 --> 11:22.899
meet me where they're building
the new library,

11:22.986 --> 11:24.248
at the corner of
Washington and Olive.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.859
Ah! That's it!

11:31.299 --> 11:32.648
Dinner and the limo
were fantastic,

11:32.735 --> 11:34.302
and your parents
were delightful.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.043
You didn't tell me
that they were Asian, too.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.827
Here come Mike and Anna.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.090
Just smile and
don't be yourself.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.049
-Hi, Jeanie.
-Hi.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.790
Is that Reese?

11:43.877 --> 11:46.314
Hello, it is such a pleasure
to see you.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.229
-So you've met.
-Yeah, he steals my lunch

11:48.316 --> 11:50.013
every day and throws
me in a garbage can.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.450
Your mother makes a marvelous
tuna fish sandwich.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.538
Give her my best, will you?

11:53.625 --> 11:56.411
Wow. I've never seen Reese so...

11:56.498 --> 11:58.152
un-psycho-like before.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.284
How could I be anything
but a perfect gentleman

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
around someone as breathtaking
as Jeanie?

12:03.679 --> 12:05.159
[chuckles]

12:06.595 --> 12:08.553
-Bye. See ya.
-JEANIE: See ya.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.947
Reese, that wasn't
in the script.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.557
I'm sorry-- are you going
to spray me again?

12:12.644 --> 12:15.299
No, it was actually really nice.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.779
I liked it.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.130
Would you like to have
this dance with me?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.871
I'd be delighted.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.398
You can go ahead
and grab my butt.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.749
You're paying for it.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.278
Now, remember, we only have
to be nice to him until he gets

12:37.365 --> 12:38.366
close enough
to the van to grab him.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.542
[gasps]

12:40.629 --> 12:44.415
Do you folks have a young
boy you don't care about?

12:44.502 --> 12:45.634
What?

12:45.721 --> 12:48.593
He wanted me to give you this.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.773
[groans]

12:53.860 --> 12:56.036
You see the way Dewey's
throwing around my money?

12:56.123 --> 12:58.603
He has minions!

12:58.690 --> 13:01.389
Oh, well, at least he returned
my HMO card.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.739
"If you want another..."
Ah, great!

13:03.826 --> 13:05.306
I want another
piece of my wallet,

13:05.393 --> 13:07.525
we have to meet him at the
corner of Temple and Fourth.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.701
"Wear what's in the bag."

13:10.964 --> 13:13.053
Oh! Will you look at this?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.837
Great. It's bad enough
we have to traipse

13:14.924 --> 13:16.360
all over town looking for him,

13:16.447 --> 13:17.971
-now we have to dress up?!
-How's he even

13:18.058 --> 13:19.233
gonna know
if we're wearing this?

13:19.320 --> 13:20.712
I'll tell you how.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.236
The little monster
has a camera in here.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.285
If you think you're going
to make a fool out of me,

13:28.372 --> 13:29.809
I've got news for you,
little man:

13:29.896 --> 13:31.941
It's not going to happen!

13:40.471 --> 13:41.908
Malcolm, I don't
understand this.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.257
The morp
is going great downstairs.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.911
Why do we have to come up here?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.043
It finally hit me:

13:47.130 --> 13:49.002
These people have to know
that we're having
a good time without them.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.481
Why do you care
what they think?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.048
I don't care,

13:52.135 --> 13:53.702
but I want them
to know I don't care.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.836
Perfect.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.753
Hey, Malcolm.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.320
Isn't this a great party?

14:03.407 --> 14:04.713
Open your eyes, Reese--
everything about this night

14:04.800 --> 14:06.584
is completely phony.

14:06.671 --> 14:09.326
Maybe it isphony,
but maybe something

14:09.413 --> 14:11.154
that starts out as phony
can turn into something real.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.071
You may call this
corny, Malcolm,

14:15.158 --> 14:17.334
but this really is
a night to cherish.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.119
Reese.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.172
Sorry, Steve,
official prom business.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.870
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

14:34.612 --> 14:36.745
I just thought you people
should know

14:36.832 --> 14:39.400
that while you're up here
enjoying what

14:39.487 --> 14:40.705
you have deluded yourselves
into thinking

14:40.792 --> 14:42.272
is the greatest night
of your lives,

14:42.359 --> 14:44.535
the people who you've excluded
from this charade

14:44.622 --> 14:46.146
are downstairs right now

14:46.233 --> 14:49.758
having a party
that obliterates yours.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.110
You think you're on the inside,
but you're on the outside.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.420
How does thatmake you feel?

15:02.684 --> 15:06.296
♪ I feel good ♪

15:06.383 --> 15:09.560
♪ I knew that I would ♪

15:09.647 --> 15:11.911
♪ I feel good ♪

15:11.998 --> 15:16.611
♪ I knew that I would, now ♪

15:16.698 --> 15:19.179
♪ So good, so good ♪

15:19.266 --> 15:21.529
♪ I've got you ♪

15:21.616 --> 15:22.704
♪ Wh-aoh! ♪

15:22.791 --> 15:24.880
LOIS:
This is our fifth stop, Hal.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.142
Is this gonna go on all night?

15:26.229 --> 15:27.752
Well, he's certainly
dragging it out.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.320
So far, all he's given me
back from my wallet is crap!

15:30.407 --> 15:33.976
I got my library card,
my organ donor card...

15:34.063 --> 15:36.370
Oh, wait, he did give
me back my tip chart.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.676
God knows how much of your money
he's spent on presents

15:38.763 --> 15:40.809
-and party supplies.
-So Dewey wants a party?

15:40.896 --> 15:43.377
You hold him down;
I'll give him a party!

15:43.464 --> 15:44.769
-Can I help you?
-Oh, uh...

15:44.856 --> 15:46.510
Yes, uh...

15:46.597 --> 15:48.599
"I'm Dewey's jackass father."

15:48.686 --> 15:52.299
Hey! The sex maniacs are here!

15:52.386 --> 15:54.388
If you can keep your hands
off your wife long enough,

15:54.475 --> 15:56.172
pull up to the window.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.963
Oh.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.095
You guys were so much hotter
in my mind

16:06.182 --> 16:07.531
when Dewey told me the story.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.968
Just give us our stuff.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.624
Cake.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.718
Ah, my driver's license.

16:20.805 --> 16:21.806
We're getting closer.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.025
Look at that.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.984
He drew a mustache on you.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.986
No, I did that.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.683
I wanted to see how it looked.

16:28.770 --> 16:29.727
[sighs]

16:33.209 --> 16:35.168
-Punch?
-No, thanks.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.735
Look, I know
that was embarrassing,

16:37.822 --> 16:39.955
but all those people up there
think you're a creep, anyway,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.174
so nothing lost.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.392
I guess.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.703
Oh, my God!

16:52.054 --> 16:54.056
So there really is a party
going on down here.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.580
Look, we're having a great time.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.539
We're enjoying just
being with each other.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.455
Yeah, but this place
is so dark and creepy.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.284
Didn't the janitor kill someone
down here a few years ago?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.155
Okay, you've come down
to see the freak show.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.374
You've had your fun.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.593
Why don't you leave us alone?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.204
You know what?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.858
You guys should
just come upstairs.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.295
What?

17:15.382 --> 17:16.773
Yeah, there's only
a month left of school,

17:16.861 --> 17:18.646
and all this stuff
about who's cool and who's not,

17:18.733 --> 17:20.909
I mean, it's just
kind of silly, isn't it?

17:20.996 --> 17:22.171
CARLA: Oh, really?

17:22.258 --> 17:23.390
Was it silly in fourth grade,

17:23.477 --> 17:25.348
when I was the only kid
on our street

17:25.435 --> 17:26.828
you didn't invite
to your birthday party?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.048
I sent you an invitation.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.223
You stood me up.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.354
No, I didn't.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.052
I would have
loved to have gone.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.447
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.232
[gasps]

17:40.407 --> 17:41.756
What are you doing?

17:41.843 --> 17:43.627
Suddenly a hug
solves everything?

17:43.714 --> 17:46.152
Come on, guys,
let's go to the prom.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.589
Carla?

17:51.157 --> 17:53.463
Heather?

17:53.550 --> 17:56.075
This isn't the way
I thought it would happen,

17:56.162 --> 17:59.817
but I just got asked
to the prom!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.169
A.J., you can't be serious.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.909
Hey, it took guts
for those girls

18:04.996 --> 18:06.563
to come down here and apologize.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.175
And I'd like to think I'm
big enough to be able to admit

18:09.262 --> 18:10.959
I'd like to have sex
with one of them.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.354
You can't just let them
say "I'm sorry"

18:14.441 --> 18:16.530
after 12 years of treating us
like crap!

18:16.617 --> 18:18.706
Wait a minute,
they never even said "sorry!"

18:18.793 --> 18:20.447
This is a trap!

18:20.534 --> 18:23.145
These are the same people
who made fun of your clothes

18:23.232 --> 18:25.495
all through school,
and laughed at your haircuts,

18:25.582 --> 18:27.932
and called you Malcolm-Balcolm!

18:28.977 --> 18:31.849
You'll be sorry!

18:33.982 --> 18:35.940
Finally.

18:36.027 --> 18:39.292
Now we've got some
breathing room in here.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.510
[sighs]

18:52.696 --> 18:54.611
You're a really good dancer.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.700
When I'm with you, it doesn't
even feel like we're dancing.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.919
It's like we're floating.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.878
I misjudged you, Reese.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.272
I just chose you because
you weren't completely hideous,

19:03.359 --> 19:05.144
and I knew
you wouldn't have a date.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.929
But you're so much more
than that.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.366
You've made me feel wonderful.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.325
It's been a really
great night for me, too.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.370
You helped me find
a little part of me

19:14.457 --> 19:16.067
that I didn't even
know was there,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.505
the part that isn't
a gigantic jackass.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.594
You know...

19:20.681 --> 19:22.770
I wasn't planning on the night
ending this way,

19:22.857 --> 19:26.252
but why don't we
get out of here,

19:26.339 --> 19:30.081
grab a blanket and a bottle
of wine and go to the beach.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.213
You mean it?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.258
Yes, Reese.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.434
I really want you.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.353
[alarm beeps ]

19:40.440 --> 19:41.354
Oh, wow.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.269
It's 12:00 already?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.009
Too bad, I was having fun.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.272
Well, see you at school.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.751
Reese, where are you going?

19:47.838 --> 19:50.058
It's midnight.
I'm off the clock.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.799
But what about us?

19:51.886 --> 19:53.496
And all those things you said?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.454
Well, if I want to make
a career out of this,

19:54.541 --> 19:55.933
I've gotta satisfy my customers.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.544
And I think I did.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.501
Tell your friends.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.376
Why do we have to haul
all this stuff in here

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
when we have no intention
of giving him a party?

20:05.465 --> 20:07.249
We have to humor him
until he reveals himself.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.729
This has got to be the place.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.472
There you are!

20:12.559 --> 20:14.125
You are in so much
trouble, young man!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.779
I want my wallet now.

20:15.866 --> 20:16.954
Here you go.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.347
Well, at least we got here

20:18.434 --> 20:20.349
before you spent all my cash.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.743
It cost so much to keep this
place open after hours,

20:22.830 --> 20:24.614
I had to put that
on your credit card.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.225
Okay, Mr. smart guy.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.574
Now you can help us

20:27.661 --> 20:29.271
load all this stuff
back in the car.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.664
I know you think
you're having a party,

20:30.751 --> 20:32.231
but you can forget about it.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.406
This isn't for me.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.234
It's too late for my childhood,

20:35.321 --> 20:36.322
but it's not too late for his.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.759
Jamie?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.151
Here's a camera.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.501
So now you have no excuse

20:41.588 --> 20:42.763
for not documenting

20:42.850 --> 20:44.852
every important event
in Jamie's life,

20:44.939 --> 20:46.636
starting tonight with his party.

20:46.723 --> 20:47.768
That is a really nice camera.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.073
How could you afford...?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.379
Right.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.908
Here, sweetie.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.345
Let's go have some cake.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.396
That was a good thing
you did, son.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.267
Thanks.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.616
Enjoy the cake.

21:09.703 --> 21:10.747
That's the last thing

21:10.834 --> 21:12.271
you're going to eat
in a long time

21:12.358 --> 21:13.533
that hasn't been
dipped in sardine juice.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.232
Hey! Finally!

21:17.319 --> 21:18.799
A picture for your memory book.
