[low whirring]

00:12.620 --> 00:14.068
- Fisher?

00:14.137 --> 00:15.689
What is going on?

00:15.758 --> 00:17.793
- 'Sup?

00:17.862 --> 00:18.965
You're not Lex.

00:19.034 --> 00:20.862
I just wasted
a great helmet flip.

00:20.931 --> 00:23.379
- A helmet flip is not
gonna impress Lex.

00:23.448 --> 00:25.586
- The helmet is just
the appetizer.

00:25.655 --> 00:27.551
I'm building this pedestal
to display

00:27.620 --> 00:29.517
the most prestigious
science award given to tweens,

00:29.586 --> 00:32.275
the Warren Bell Prize.

00:32.344 --> 00:34.172
- What is that?
Some sort of nerd context?

00:34.241 --> 00:37.827
- Yes, and I won! Whoo-hoo!

00:37.896 --> 00:39.241
Not only do I get a trophy,

00:39.310 --> 00:41.379
but there's also a dinner
and I get to bring a date.

00:41.448 --> 00:42.896
- There's no way Lex
is gonna go with you--

00:42.965 --> 00:45.931
- There's a chocolate fountain.
- [gasps]

00:46.000 --> 00:47.965
Lex loves chocolate fountains!

00:48.034 --> 00:49.586
Your plan might actually work.

00:49.655 --> 00:51.172
- I know. Get ready, world!

00:51.241 --> 00:53.482
You're about to meet Flex!

00:53.551 --> 00:54.620
- Flex?

00:54.689 --> 00:56.137
- Yeah, that's our couple name.

00:56.206 --> 00:59.206
Fisher plus Lex equals "Flex."

00:59.275 --> 01:00.689
Just let me have this.

01:03.482 --> 01:05.896
- Who's ready
for the Snow Cone Festival?

01:05.965 --> 01:08.827
- I heard there are snow cones
for dogs this year.

01:08.896 --> 01:10.827
Reggie, we'll get yours
with extra gravy.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.000
- Oh, that reminds me
of a funny story about gravy.

01:13.068 --> 01:15.689
See, it was Thanksgiving 2017--
- Come on!

01:15.758 --> 01:17.793
No one's gonna ask me
what I'm doing?

01:17.862 --> 01:20.655
I'm sparking up a storm
over here!

01:20.724 --> 01:22.862
- What are you doing?
- Glad you asked.

01:22.931 --> 01:25.482
I'm making a pedestal
for a big award I'm getting.

01:25.551 --> 01:27.827
There's a fancy dinner,
and I get to bring someone.

01:27.896 --> 01:29.034
- Okay, before I commit,

01:29.103 --> 01:31.068
you should know
I'm allergic to peanuts.

01:31.137 --> 01:32.931
- I'm not inviting you.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.137
I'm inviting Lex.

01:35.206 --> 01:37.793
- Fisher, I'm flattered,
but for the millionth time--

01:37.862 --> 01:39.275
- There'll be
a chocolate fountain.

01:39.344 --> 01:41.620
- [gasps]
I love chocolate fountains.

01:41.689 --> 01:45.034
- Sounds like something
you can't turn down then.

01:45.103 --> 01:47.551
- Well, on one hand, I don't
wanna give you the wrong idea.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.310
But on the other hand,

01:49.379 --> 01:52.379
chocolate fountains.

01:52.448 --> 01:54.344
I appreciate the invitation,

01:54.413 --> 01:56.793
but I think you should
take somebody else.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.517
- I'm sorry, Fish.
That was rough.

02:00.586 --> 02:03.965
I feel really bad for you.

02:04.034 --> 02:05.896
To the Snow Cone Festival!

02:05.965 --> 02:07.620
- Whoo-hoo!

02:09.275 --> 02:11.241
- That was embarrassing.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.620
- Who said that?

02:13.689 --> 02:16.379
- I did.

02:16.448 --> 02:18.275
- Jaget, why are you hiding
in the bushes?

02:18.344 --> 02:19.896
- I'm training my student

02:19.965 --> 02:23.827
in the ancient Jag-Jitsu art
of suburban camouflage.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.068
- What student?

02:25.137 --> 02:27.827
- Why don't you ask
the recycling bin.

02:27.896 --> 02:30.241
- [screams]

02:30.310 --> 02:31.551
- This is Gloria.

02:31.620 --> 02:34.068
Gloria, this is science kid.

02:34.137 --> 02:35.620
- Hey, science kid.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.620
That girl shot you down hard.

02:38.689 --> 02:39.793
- But you're in luck.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.896
I'm not only
a Jag-Jitsu sensei.

02:41.965 --> 02:43.689
I'm also a love sensei,

02:43.758 --> 02:45.517
and I know how to get you
that date you want.

02:45.586 --> 02:48.206
- No, it's useless.
- I'd listen to him.

02:48.275 --> 02:50.551
I didn't think he could make me
into a recycling bin,

02:50.620 --> 02:52.034
but look at me now.

02:54.793 --> 02:56.896
- I mean,
I've tried everything,

02:56.965 --> 03:00.206
so I am getting
a little desperate.

03:00.275 --> 03:01.931
You know what?
Let's do it!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.793
- Only I get to say
"let's do it."

03:04.862 --> 03:06.620
Let's do it.

03:13.931 --> 03:16.310
- Hey, nice sash.
- Oh, thank you.

03:16.379 --> 03:18.793
Countless hours of eating snow
cones have made me an expert,

03:18.862 --> 03:20.379
so now, I get
to live out my dream

03:20.448 --> 03:23.000
of being a snow cone judge.

03:23.068 --> 03:25.448
- Have fun. I promised Reggie
I'd get him a dog snow cone.

03:25.517 --> 03:27.655
We'll catch up.
Come on.

03:27.724 --> 03:29.551
- Time to get to work.

03:29.620 --> 03:30.793
[clears throat]

03:30.862 --> 03:32.586
I'll have
your finest snow cone.

03:32.655 --> 03:36.482
- Can't you see I'm busy--
Judge Munchy?!

03:36.551 --> 03:39.827
I had no idea.
So sorry about that!

03:42.379 --> 03:45.517
- Hmm, fruity bouquet.

03:45.586 --> 03:48.103
I'm getting a hint of--
is it blue?

03:51.586 --> 03:54.655
Excellent ratio
of ice to syrup.

03:54.724 --> 03:57.103
But how fresh is this ice?

03:57.172 --> 04:00.241
- I crushed it this morning.

04:00.310 --> 04:04.068
Okay! It's three days old!

04:04.137 --> 04:06.551
- Be better.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.551
- I'll try, Judge Munchy!

04:08.620 --> 04:11.379
Here, a snow cone
for your friend.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.724
- Ooh, a free snow cone!

04:13.793 --> 04:15.310
- You haven't
seen anything yet.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.931
I've got a whole festival
to judge.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.965
- Let's do it!

04:25.793 --> 04:27.620
- The target is in sight.

04:27.689 --> 04:30.379
- She's the love of my life,
not a target.

04:30.448 --> 04:31.689
- This is my mission,

04:31.758 --> 04:35.000
so I get to make up the words.

04:35.068 --> 04:38.241
I'm about to transform you
into a hero.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.517
- How are you gonna do that?

04:39.586 --> 04:41.000
- Well, science kid,

04:41.068 --> 04:43.965
Lex said she wants a snow cone
for her dog, Reggie, so--

04:44.034 --> 04:47.000
- You know Lex's dog's name,
but not mine?

04:47.068 --> 04:49.517
- That's right.

04:49.586 --> 04:51.448
Gloria's gonna steal
the snow cone.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.034
That's when you say, "Hey, you!

04:53.103 --> 04:55.172
Get your dang hands
off that snow cone!"

04:55.241 --> 04:57.310
- Then I'll pretend
to be scared, run off,

04:57.379 --> 04:58.724
and you'll be a hero.

04:58.793 --> 05:01.241
Even though in a real fight,
I would destroy you.

05:05.517 --> 05:07.137
- I'm not so sure about this.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.517
- It's okay.

05:08.586 --> 05:11.655
I'm sure enough
for the both of us.

05:11.724 --> 05:14.103
Gloria, make your sensei proud.

05:17.724 --> 05:20.103
- Hey, girl!
Gimme that snow cone!

05:20.172 --> 05:21.172

05:21.241 --> 05:23.551
- Hey, you!
- Fisher?

05:23.620 --> 05:25.758
- Get your dang hands
off that snow cone.

05:25.827 --> 05:27.620
- No, I got this.
Stop, pedestrian!

05:27.689 --> 05:30.862
- Whoa!
[Reggie barks]

05:30.931 --> 05:32.413
- Curses!

05:32.482 --> 05:35.965
The only thing that can stop
Jag-Jitsu is more Jag-Jitsu.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.206
- Yeah, that's right.
You don't want none of this!

05:42.275 --> 05:44.034
Reggie, can I get a woof woof?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.344
Reggie?

05:47.413 --> 05:49.758
Where's Reggie? -
I don't know.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.310
He must have run off,
which was not part of the plan.

05:52.379 --> 05:53.689
- What plan?

05:53.758 --> 05:55.586
- Uh, the plan
to spend a lovely day

05:55.655 --> 05:57.758
at the Snow Cone Festival!

05:57.827 --> 05:59.689
- Well, he's never
run off before.

I can't find him anywhere.

What am I gonna do?

What am I gonna do?!

to breathe out.

- [exhales]
Thanks.

06:47.586 --> 06:48.827
- Check it out, Lex.

06:48.896 --> 06:52.931
We got pepperoni pizza
snow cones!

- You don't seem nearly
as excited as you should be.

06:55.344 --> 06:56.931
- Guys, Reggie, ran off.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.379
- What?

06:58.448 --> 07:01.172
- Well now eating a pizza
snow cone seems insensitive.

07:01.241 --> 07:02.793
- Mm-hmm.

07:02.862 --> 07:04.379
- So what happened?

07:04.448 --> 07:06.655
- Some crazy girl tried
to take Reggie's snow cone,

07:06.724 --> 07:08.172
and then he was gone.

07:08.241 --> 07:11.068
- What kind of monster
would steal a dog's snow cone?

07:11.137 --> 07:12.793
- Let's not ask
too many questions.

07:12.862 --> 07:16.068
But I'm sure she acted alone.

07:16.137 --> 07:17.344
Let's find that dog.

07:17.413 --> 07:18.896
- Okay. Yeah, let's
spread out and look.

07:18.965 --> 07:20.206
- Okay, I'm gonna stay here.

07:20.275 --> 07:21.862
Reggie really liked
those dog snow cones,

07:21.931 --> 07:23.655
So maybe the smell of it
will bring him back.

07:23.724 --> 07:24.931
- Munchy, let's roll.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.896
- What? No.
That would take too long.

07:26.965 --> 07:28.172
Let's run!
[sash snaps]

07:31.517 --> 07:33.137
- I'm so sorry
for what happened.

07:33.206 --> 07:34.413
- It's not your fault.

07:34.482 --> 07:36.896
- Yeah.

07:36.965 --> 07:38.827
I'm just gonna go back to
my lab and get some equipment

07:38.896 --> 07:40.172
that can help find Reggie.
- Okay.

07:40.241 --> 07:42.379
And, Fisher,
thank you for helping.

07:42.448 --> 07:43.724
- Sure thing.

07:43.793 --> 07:46.724
That's what I did: help,
not ruin everything.

07:46.793 --> 07:48.965
I'm a problem solver,
not a problem causer.

07:50.586 --> 07:51.758
See ya!

07:57.586 --> 07:59.448
- How's it going, science kid?

07:59.517 --> 08:01.551
- "How's it going"?

08:01.620 --> 08:02.827
"How's it going"?!

08:02.896 --> 08:05.172
- Yeah, how is it going?

08:05.241 --> 08:07.206
- It's going
pretty stinkin' bad!

08:07.275 --> 08:08.655
- Language!

08:08.724 --> 08:10.103
- I'm sorry,

08:10.172 --> 08:12.068
but you made the love
of my life's dog run away,

08:12.137 --> 08:14.172
and I had to lie to her
to cover it up.

08:14.241 --> 08:16.655
- Don't worry.
Gloria and I are here to help.

08:16.724 --> 08:18.689
- I don't want your help.

08:18.758 --> 08:21.827
This is all your fault!

08:27.586 --> 08:29.551

to Jaget.

08:31.275 --> 08:35.655
I help everyone, but not
everyone can see how I do it.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.103
Why aren't you
writing this down?

08:37.172 --> 08:39.206
- You said never to leave
a paper trail, Sensei.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.620
- Using my own words
against me.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.000
You're learning.

08:46.310 --> 08:47.448
- Reggie?

08:47.517 --> 08:48.965
- Reggie?
- Reggie?

08:49.034 --> 08:50.379
- Reggie!

08:50.448 --> 08:51.965

for almost an hour,

08:52.034 --> 08:53.793
and there's still no sign
of Reggie.

08:53.862 --> 08:55.827

way to cover more ground.

shaped like a giant cow!

09:17.206 --> 09:19.103
- Hey, guys. What do you think
of my new ride?

09:19.172 --> 09:22.241
- It's incredible, but why
do you have a hot air balloon?

09:22.310 --> 09:23.965
- I got it to fly
over the Snow Cone Festival

09:24.034 --> 09:25.517
to give out free samples.

09:25.586 --> 09:27.482
Hey, do you mind holding this
until I get back?

- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

- Yes.

09:41.068 --> 09:45.000
Ty is Santa!
This changes everything!

- No, no.

is often necessary.

them the jellyfish of the sky.

steer the balloon

we can charge them.

my phone is still dead.

going to find Reggie?

See, different animals respond
to different sound frequencies.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.689
- Yeah.

20:02.758 --> 20:05.724
Reggie running off
was never part of the plan.

20:05.793 --> 20:08.586
- I can't believe you lied.
- Me either.

20:08.655 --> 20:10.413
That's why I'm telling you
the truth now.

20:10.482 --> 20:12.103
I want you to go
to that dinner with me,

20:12.172 --> 20:14.793
but not if it's based on a lie.

20:14.862 --> 20:17.241
- You're so stupid!

20:19.034 --> 20:21.862
She was gonna go with you,
and you blew it.

20:21.931 --> 20:23.896
- Jaget, how long
have you been back there?

20:23.965 --> 20:25.965
- Long enough
to see science kid

20:26.034 --> 20:28.724
ruin his love sensei's plan.

20:28.793 --> 20:29.931
It was perfect:

20:30.000 --> 20:32.068
disguises, heroes,

20:32.137 --> 20:34.310
recycling bins.

20:34.379 --> 20:35.620
- I can't believe this.

20:35.689 --> 20:37.310
You know, one day,
karma is gonna get you.

20:37.379 --> 20:38.965
- I don't who karma is,

20:39.034 --> 20:43.068
but I'll see her coming
with my Jaget-vision.

20:43.137 --> 20:45.137
I see all angles at once:

20:45.206 --> 20:46.793
left, right, up.

20:46.862 --> 20:48.689
[hot air balloon whistles]
Oh, no.

20:48.758 --> 20:51.000
[all scream]

20:53.482 --> 20:55.724
- Whoa, I thought
we'd land harder than that.

20:55.793 --> 20:57.551
Something must have
cushioned our fall.

20:59.586 --> 21:02.000
- Hey, you found Reggie!

21:02.068 --> 21:04.206
- It was pretty smart of us
to throw those milk cartoons.

21:04.275 --> 21:05.620
Right?
- Are you kidding?

21:05.689 --> 21:07.862
We could have been
seriously injured.

21:07.931 --> 21:09.206
- I knew it.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.655
- But we weren't.

21:11.724 --> 21:13.413
And that's why
it was a really smart plan.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.655
- Oh, I knew it!
- Yes!

21:15.724 --> 21:17.862
- Hey, where did you get
a hot air balloon?

21:17.931 --> 21:19.724
- We'll tell you
the whole crazy story

21:19.793 --> 21:22.137
on our way to apologize to Ty.

21:22.206 --> 21:24.000
- Spoiler alert, we stole it.

21:29.724 --> 21:30.793
- Hey!

21:30.862 --> 21:33.310
- Who said that?

21:33.379 --> 21:35.206
- I did!

21:35.275 --> 21:36.827
- You gotta stop doing that
to me.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.482
- Okay. But if they still have
that chocolate fountain

21:40.551 --> 21:44.310
at your dinner,
I'll go with you, Fisher.

21:44.379 --> 21:45.965
- You used my name
and not "science kid"?

21:46.034 --> 21:47.586
- Yeah, that was more
of a Jaget thing,

21:47.655 --> 21:50.068
and I'm off the clock.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.172
- Let's do it.

21:51.241 --> 21:52.758
Just one thing, though.

21:52.827 --> 21:55.482
Could you not wear
the garbage can?

21:55.551 --> 21:57.931
- It's a recycling bin,
but, yeah!

22:04.655 --> 22:07.034
- All part of my plan!
