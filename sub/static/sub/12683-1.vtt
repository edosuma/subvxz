02:09.560 --> 02:11.190
They say she's a real live angel.

02:13.530 --> 02:18.490
Everyone in there calls her
"kind-hearted" Geum-ja.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.050
One, two, three, four!

02:34.420 --> 02:37.720
<i>My path is ridden with...</i>

02:59.440 --> 03:03.710
<i>...high walls and deep pitfalls.</i>

03:03.950 --> 03:11.540
<i>Who will aid me across these
dark obstacles?</i>

03:12.160 --> 03:18.560
<i>The Lord's breath lifts me over
these walls.</i>

03:18.830 --> 03:26.300
<i>The Lord's hands bridge my steps
safely over these pitfalls.</i>

03:26.670 --> 03:33.510
<i>...safely over these pitfalls.</i>

03:46.820 --> 03:49.180
What about the winter clothes
I sent you?

03:55.460 --> 03:58.190
It's been hard, hasn't it?
13 and a half years.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.070
I'm so proud of you.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.840
<i>Won-mo and I were playing marbles
here that day, and I lost.</i>

04:08.110 --> 04:11.440
<i>Won-mo won the biggest marble.</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:14.680
<i>Then he ran off to go home.</i>

04:14.820 --> 04:16.779
<i>The investigating authorities...</i>

04:17.149 --> 04:20.220
<i>confirmed the details with a woman
who confessed to the crime.</i>

04:20.320 --> 04:23.920
<i>Lee Geum-ja was first introduced to
the public...</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:27.660
<i>as the criminal who abducted and
killed Park Won-mo, a little boy...</i>

04:28.100 --> 04:29.990
<i>She was nineteen at the time.</i>

04:31.270 --> 04:33.700
<i>The whole nation was shocked</i>

04:33.870 --> 04:35.800
<i>by her youth, her ruthless methods...</i>

04:36.010 --> 04:38.830
<i>and by her unabashed naivety.</i>

04:39.210 --> 04:40.470
<i>My state of mind...</i>

04:40.510 --> 04:43.340
<i>This is where the alleged perpetrator
had confined young Park Won-mo.</i>

04:43.610 --> 04:46.310
<i>She claims she only wanted to stop
his crying with a pillow...</i>

04:46.580 --> 04:49.780
<i>But what shocked us more were her
beautiful looks.</i>

04:50.590 --> 04:54.280
<i>Clamouring tabloids compared her to
Olivia Hussey...</i>

04:54.890 --> 04:59.450
<i>A tactless director announced plans for
a Lee Geum-ja movie...</i>

04:59.760 --> 05:02.030
<i>creating a backlash from the press.</i>

05:02.570 --> 05:06.970
<i>That fall, polka-dot dresses became
the trend.</i>

05:09.070 --> 05:10.740
I saw you on TV.

05:11.370 --> 05:16.270
Behind that wicked witch's face of yours
I saw the presence of an angel.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.270
<i>An angel... Could that be true?</i>

05:23.920 --> 05:27.250
<i>Do you really think
an angel resides in me?</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:29.620
<i>If so, where was that angel...</i>

05:29.730 --> 05:33.790
<i>when I was committing
such an evil act?</i>

05:34.960 --> 05:37.020
<i>I always wondered about this</i>

05:37.100 --> 05:39.370
<i>after hearing what the preacher said.</i>

05:39.740 --> 05:42.170
<i>And then, I realized...</i>

05:42.610 --> 05:47.510
<i>that the angel inside me only reveals
itself when I invoke it.</i>

05:49.880 --> 05:52.140
<i>Where are you? Please, come out.</i>

05:53.880 --> 05:55.410
I'm right here.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.280
This act of invoking an angel...

06:00.960 --> 06:03.560
<i>This is what we call prayer.</i>

06:05.060 --> 06:11.930
<i>Actually, prison is an ideal place to
learn to pray.</i>

06:14.870 --> 06:16.000
Because...

06:16.470 --> 06:23.780
we know that we are all sinners
in here.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.910
Thank you.

06:32.660 --> 06:37.120
Testimonials of Faith Day for Inmates.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.170
It's tradition to eat
tofu on release...

06:56.680 --> 06:59.510
so that you'll live white
and never sin again.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.390
Why don't you go screw yourself?

Kim Yang-hee: Time served 1998-2002

08:11.550 --> 08:12.850
Meet your new cellmate.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.730
I'm Kim Yang-hee. I got 5 years.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.260
<i>They said there was someone at
Kyoungju Women's Prison...</i>

08:24.770 --> 08:27.030
<i>whose face would shine.</i>

08:27.940 --> 08:29.430
You were a whore, weren't you?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.570
<i>I heard her nickname was "the Witch".</i>

08:34.179 --> 08:35.400
Come on in.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.210
You don't usually wear ties.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.410
It's mandatory here.

09:11.180 --> 09:14.080
We have lots of VIPs visiting.

09:14.750 --> 09:18.280
Shit, it's too tight.
Loosen it up a bit.

09:18.820 --> 09:22.990
<i>He was my pimp.</i>

09:23.860 --> 09:26.120
<i>It felt so good
when I was strangling him.</i>

09:31.830 --> 09:35.440
<i>- I should've killed myself instead
- Then, die.</i>

09:36.040 --> 09:40.570
<i>And be born again. Over and over
if you need to.</i>

09:42.480 --> 09:50.310
Prayer is like a scrubbing towel
Scrub off all your sins.

09:51.790 --> 09:56.430
Then your skin will become as new as
a baby's ass. Right?

09:57.390 --> 10:02.160
Geum-ja taught me how to lament
my past lives.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.030
It's a little noisy,
being under the stairs...

10:17.850 --> 10:19.970
But this place brings good luck.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.080
Look at me. Three years of giving
unlicensed haircuts...

10:26.390 --> 10:28.650
And now I have a real shop of my own.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.320
So set your hopes high.

10:47.710 --> 10:50.500
These were mine,
but they'll have to do for now.

10:55.990 --> 11:00.890
You know I wanted to get you better
things, right?

11:04.860 --> 11:08.420
Don't you have any high heels?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.110
You never really loved me, did you?

11:20.710 --> 11:22.270
You were just pretending, right?

11:26.650 --> 11:28.340
You've changed a lot.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.450
You used to be so sweet...

11:31.650 --> 11:33.250
and talk so kindly.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.660
Are you starting the plan already?

11:38.830 --> 11:43.800
<i>'No. The plan was already started
13 years ago'...</i>

11:45.970 --> 11:49.100
<i>so Geum-ja murmured to herself.</i>

13:29.410 --> 13:30.700
Farewell.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.480
What is it you want from us?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.100
<i>Please forgive me. Please...</i>

14:32.730 --> 14:38.770
<i>She was going to beg Won-mo's
parents until she had no fingers left.</i>

14:39.370 --> 14:41.070
This is 802/9 Han Apartments...

14:41.310 --> 14:44.180
We've had a finger cut off here!

14:55.160 --> 14:59.360
<i>Every penny Geum-ja earned from
laboring in prison...</i>

14:59.630 --> 15:02.060
<i>had to go to pay for her
finger operation.</i>

15:02.870 --> 15:04.330
<i>Then 6 days later...</i>

15:05.430 --> 15:06.400
Naruse Bakery

15:06.400 --> 15:08.770
For now, just work till noon.
Naruse Bakery

15:09.070 --> 15:11.540
The dawn hours are tough for me with
my low blood pressure.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.740
Geun-shik, say hello.

15:18.510 --> 15:22.020
I told you about Lee Geum-ja, right?

15:23.420 --> 15:24.410
Hello.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.320
I told you she was pretty.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.100
Can I call you elder sister?

15:43.140 --> 15:45.070
Just call me Geum-ja.

15:46.740 --> 15:48.330
<i>Lee Geum-ja...</i>

15:49.780 --> 15:53.680
<i>When she first came, she cried
non-stop, like a newborn baby.</i>

15:54.580 --> 15:57.010
<i>Man, it was so depressing.</i>

15:59.050 --> 16:00.190
Damn bitch!

16:05.560 --> 16:08.050
It brings bad luck. Stop crying!

16:16.170 --> 16:22.610
<i>As a man once taught her, whenever
she was having a hard time...</i>

16:23.110 --> 16:26.640
<i>She'd bend over and take five
deep breaths.</i>

16:28.080 --> 16:31.520
Woo So-young: Time served 1990-1996

16:32.220 --> 16:34.950
What are you looking at?
You damn bitches!

16:38.260 --> 16:40.690
Down on the floor and keep your damn
hands up!

16:56.180 --> 17:01.680
<i>I felt like I was dying
because I couldn't be with my love...</i>

17:02.350 --> 17:06.490
Turned out I was suffering
from chronic kidney failure.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.420
But it felt like I was dying anyway.

17:12.530 --> 17:16.660
Then this bitch suddenly says she'll
give me one of her kidneys.

17:19.569 --> 17:25.940
It's not as if a kidney's
a bit of fluff you give away so easily.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.710
Damn bitch.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.840
It brings me bad luck. Stop crying!

17:41.990 --> 17:45.450
Honey, Geum-ja's here.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.890
You've sure changed a lot.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.830
You heard my wife, stay down!

17:57.840 --> 18:03.870
That's when I realized I'm married
to a goddess.

18:04.810 --> 18:10.420
With this man by my side I
was never afraid.

18:11.010 --> 18:12.420
Right, honey?

18:13.520 --> 18:17.560
Yeah, but we couldn't go in together.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.560
They should have couples prisons.

18:25.170 --> 18:29.730
But then that would be paradise,
not jail.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.770
I don't know how to thank you.

18:35.910 --> 18:42.950
Honey, Geum-ja is
readying a magnificent plan.

18:44.550 --> 18:46.150
You can help her, right?

18:51.060 --> 18:53.290
The Way of Dhamma

19:16.080 --> 19:20.690
Where did you get this? It's real old.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.750
Comrade Geum-ja, it's no use.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.530
- Go save yourself.
- Okay, right after I finish this.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.330
Finish the chicken later.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.940
And be careful.
Don't let dogs have the chicken bones.

19:42.010 --> 19:45.910
Pass me that yellowing book.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.580
Ko Sun-sook: Time served 1967-1997

19:49.650 --> 19:52.550
<i>A spy from North Korea, Ko Sun-sook
had Alzheimer's...</i>

19:52.820 --> 19:54.710
<i>and was a problem for the prison.</i>

19:55.590 --> 19:58.650
<i>So when Geum-ja volunteered to look
after her...</i>

19:58.860 --> 20:01.850
<i>Even the prison warden was relieved.</i>

20:02.100 --> 20:06.660
They were stepping around me
whispering, "The woman spy is dead".

20:06.970 --> 20:08.690
But the pride in my heart...

20:09.240 --> 20:13.470
wouldn't let me die.

20:14.810 --> 20:18.380
You said living is a struggle, too
A struggle not to die.

20:25.550 --> 20:29.350
I give you this flower...

20:32.890 --> 20:36.630
for you have vengeance to take comrade.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.120
My goodness!

21:05.530 --> 21:07.760
You shouldn't be out so late!

21:13.170 --> 21:15.230
I asked for you at Naruse.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.240
What were you thinking?

21:30.150 --> 21:35.850
I don't want every Tom Dick
and Harry dropping by.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.590
Fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.400
How could you have changed so much?

21:52.470 --> 21:54.270
This isn't like you!

21:55.840 --> 21:58.840
Could we start over again?

22:01.380 --> 22:04.040
Come to church. Please?

22:13.190 --> 22:14.750
I've converted to Buddhism!

22:16.630 --> 22:18.030
I bet you're in for adultery.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.060
- How did you know?
- It's all over your face, bitch!

22:31.080 --> 22:32.500
Please crawl over here.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.730
Please take them off.

22:54.870 --> 22:58.300
Oh Soo-hee: Time served 1993-1994

23:24.530 --> 23:26.020
Can you see it well?

23:32.540 --> 23:34.200
Say hello to each other.

23:35.810 --> 23:36.840
Hello.

23:39.980 --> 23:40.850
Hello?

23:43.490 --> 23:47.220
<i>This damn bitch is that
infamous "Witch".</i>

23:49.160 --> 23:52.250
<i>She killed her husband
and his mistress then ate them.</i>

23:52.960 --> 23:58.730
<i>So... I guess I'm not the unluckiest.</i>

23:59.870 --> 24:02.690
<i>I'll suck on her for five minutes
and cry it off.</i>

24:17.190 --> 24:19.620
I hate them skinny bitches.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.820
So go tell Geum-ja to start eating
some more, okay?

25:30.260 --> 25:33.450
Your style has changed.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.670
What's with the blood-red eye shadow?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.500
People are always saying I look
kind-hearted.

25:56.350 --> 25:59.950
People order them from me,
Modelled on their guys' photos.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.620
They're very popular.
Want me to make you one?

26:08.260 --> 26:09.830
Can you make it in silver?

26:22.140 --> 26:23.710
Did you find that bastard yet?

26:24.410 --> 26:25.380
I did.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.210
Did you kill him?

26:28.650 --> 26:29.670
Not yet.

26:30.950 --> 26:32.010
Why not?

26:32.990 --> 26:34.190
I've been busy.

26:37.930 --> 26:42.230
"Saving the best for last,"
is that it?

26:48.740 --> 26:49.630
Yes.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.430
- I'll take this one.
- Excellent choice.

26:57.010 --> 27:01.310
Is it true the owner
studied confection in Japan?

27:03.220 --> 27:05.280
The lady made this one.

27:11.390 --> 27:14.380
You've changed so much, I hardly
recognized you.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.830
- Who was she?
- Who was he?

27:23.770 --> 27:24.870
She's pretty.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.110
The detective that was in charge of
my case.

27:29.540 --> 27:31.980
When I was exactly your age...

27:34.220 --> 27:38.850
That is, when I was nineteen,
and you were five...

27:40.290 --> 27:41.310
I...

27:41.720 --> 27:45.220
Kidnapped and killed
a five year-old boy.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.960
My goodness!

27:48.960 --> 27:51.230
Don't worry. I didn't eat him...

27:51.430 --> 27:52.730
We can't eat this!

27:52.800 --> 27:55.040
It was made by hands that have killed!

27:56.840 --> 27:58.870
I'm telling you I killed him.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.610
How many times do I have to tell you?

28:04.910 --> 28:09.010
Then tell me what that marble
looked like.

28:10.590 --> 28:11.640
What?

28:12.890 --> 28:18.950
That marble you said you saw
but didn't know where it went...

28:20.130 --> 28:23.560
It was Won-mo's favorite marble.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.660
What color was it?

28:40.680 --> 28:41.780
Light green.

28:46.590 --> 28:51.220
Come on! Why would anyone confess
to a murder they didn't commit?

28:52.060 --> 28:54.390
Why won't you believe me?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.560
Is it because I'm a murderer?

29:24.590 --> 29:27.250
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven.

29:27.500 --> 29:31.830
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven
Without faith, there's only hell.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.330
Devil, begone!

29:36.500 --> 29:38.370
Begone, you devil!

31:32.720 --> 31:35.780
On top of that,
I killed again in prison.

31:45.570 --> 31:52.300
<i>Geum-ja wondered if Geun-shik
wasn't a fool.</i>

32:03.550 --> 32:05.250
I understand what you're saying...

32:05.520 --> 32:08.490
But it's against regulations to give out
that information.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.720
There is a counseling service
I can refer you to...

32:13.360 --> 32:15.630
Could you at least tell me whether she
was adopted or not?

32:16.930 --> 32:18.660
Didn't you receive the notice?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.970
I was in jail, you see.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.940
<i>I'd like to show you the 18-year-old
Lee Geum-ja...</i>

32:31.580 --> 32:34.210
<i>A pretty girl who would
turn any head...</i>

32:34.380 --> 32:36.410
<i>But who wasn't the least
bit particular.</i>

32:36.410 --> 32:39.250
<i>But this poor girl
was on the verge of going mad.</i>

32:41.060 --> 32:44.520
<i>She tried to comfort herself...</i>

32:48.730 --> 32:55.930
<i>with the thought that it happens to
every woman sooner or later.</i>

32:58.570 --> 33:01.000
Teacher? Mr. Baek?
This is Geum-ja, Lee Geum-ja.

33:03.210 --> 33:07.470
I used to polish your shoes when you
were our student teacher last year.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.780
You didn't know it was me?

33:10.750 --> 33:14.520
You told me I was sexy.

33:17.090 --> 33:19.190
Yes. You remember me, right?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.130
Pardon?

33:23.130 --> 33:24.430
Well, it's nothing much...

33:25.330 --> 33:27.260
You see, teacher, I'm pregnant.

33:28.570 --> 33:29.600
Pregnant.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.670
No, pregnant!

33:33.510 --> 33:34.670
Yes, I am.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.470
Could I go live with you? Please?

33:43.380 --> 33:45.250
I can't go to my mom's.

33:46.180 --> 33:48.950
And and it's even worse at my dad's.

33:50.890 --> 33:55.260
Him? He's just a big kid, not ready
for fatherhood.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.920
<i>Don't worry, baby. Your mama's
right here.</i>

34:06.940 --> 34:09.610
<i>The poor girl murmured to herself.</i>

34:54.360 --> 34:57.220
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep.

34:59.460 --> 35:03.930
When I was just back from Tokyo
managing a confectionery factory...

35:05.270 --> 35:10.130
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.400
<i>They all hated me.</i>

35:13.170 --> 35:15.830
<i>You have to be careful when riding
a bike after taking it though.</i>

35:19.910 --> 35:20.880
Hello.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.950
What are you doing out in the cold?

35:29.790 --> 35:32.230
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, ma'am.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.230
Geum-ja, what brings you here
at this hour?

35:43.640 --> 35:44.970
I need an advance.

35:49.510 --> 35:50.580
No advances.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.980
<i>I went to Kyoungju, where my parents
lived...</i>

35:57.120 --> 35:59.490
<i>I volunteered to teach at the women's
prison there...</i>

36:00.690 --> 36:05.760
<i>Because my folks worried I couldn't
get married with my lame leg.</i>

36:12.330 --> 36:17.800
<i>But in my third year there
I was shocked almost to death...</i>

36:18.970 --> 36:21.840
<i>after tasting a strawberry mousse
made by a kidnapper.</i>

36:22.010 --> 36:25.840
<i>The ingredients given to the inmates
were miserable...</i>

36:26.710 --> 36:31.810
<i>But she'd used them to create a cake
fit for a king.</i>

36:32.020 --> 36:33.510
Three months' advance.

36:40.090 --> 36:41.590
You know, you've changed?

36:44.060 --> 36:47.430
<i>In the end, I packed up and moved
to Seoul.</i>

36:48.100 --> 36:50.470
<i>Because I was motivated to open up
my own bakery.</i>

36:52.040 --> 36:53.340
What are you doing?

36:54.510 --> 36:56.270
Writing my account number.

37:08.690 --> 37:13.750
I want to start a family young...

37:16.330 --> 37:20.530
And hope to marry someone
I can respect.

37:33.610 --> 37:38.450
So, you did something wrong...

37:39.750 --> 37:45.820
You make penance and promise never
to do it again, right?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.520
That's just how life goes.

37:50.170 --> 37:52.660
That's life!
It's just another experience gained.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.390
Isn't that right, Geum-ja?

37:56.370 --> 37:59.400
I'm planning to kill another person.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.270
What?

38:02.940 --> 38:06.240
Do you think I'm sexy?

38:07.180 --> 38:08.980
Yes... No.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.280
Well...

38:25.130 --> 38:27.170
I was hoping we could talk some more.

38:36.410 --> 38:38.770
Maybe later?

38:43.620 --> 38:45.410
You're trying to scare me, aren't you?

38:48.490 --> 38:50.650
You're trying to put me off?

38:54.760 --> 38:57.130
Does it put you off
when a girl does this?

38:58.670 --> 38:59.630
No.

39:04.570 --> 39:05.630
Please go ahead.

39:43.480 --> 39:49.840
It was alright for me.
Was it good for you?

39:53.050 --> 39:54.880
I've been told it was so-so.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.820
No way.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.000
Mr. Baek said there are good
kidnappings and bad kidnappings.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.770
What?

40:08.940 --> 40:11.530
He said it was a good kidnapping
if the child is returned safely.

40:11.530 --> 40:14.300
And since they're rich, a little ransom
wouldn't make much difference...

40:14.610 --> 40:16.200
And although they'd have to worry
a few days...

40:16.480 --> 40:18.810
The emotional reunion would make...

40:19.010 --> 40:21.820
the family bond more closely.

40:21.850 --> 40:27.290
That's what he said, but then he went
and killed Won-mo.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.720
The boy kept crying...

40:30.260 --> 40:32.920
And Mr. Baek said he'd kill him if he
didn't stop in 5 minutes.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.530
But then he really did kill him.

40:36.630 --> 40:40.200
If he were alive, he'd be your age now
but he's dead.

40:41.770 --> 40:44.340
Then the police found a witness.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.840
Someone saw me taking Won-mo to
a bath-house.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.840
Then one day, when I came back from
the market,

40:51.650 --> 40:53.310
my daughter was gone.

41:00.850 --> 41:03.020
I got a call from Mr. Baek.

41:03.760 --> 41:08.120
He said to confess and take all the
blame or my girl would die, too.

41:09.860 --> 41:14.030
So the kidnapper had kidnapped
a kidnapper's kid.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.260
Isn't that funny?

41:19.740 --> 41:21.240
I thought it was.

41:26.410 --> 41:28.680
The house key is the middle one.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.620
Make sure these candles don't go out.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.030
Touch anything else and I'll give you
a hole in the head.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.460
Going somewhere?

45:45.840 --> 45:50.370
It'll sound like a cannon, with lots of
smoke, too.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.350
The design's so primitive.

45:53.680 --> 45:57.310
What's the use of all this fanciness?
Better to have a strong solid shot.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.980
It has to be pretty. Everything should
be pretty.

46:01.190 --> 46:06.520
It has a very short range
So get up close when you shoot.

46:07.590 --> 46:09.660
If you can hear his heart beating...

46:10.960 --> 46:13.920
And see the sweat on his forehead
even better.

46:16.470 --> 46:21.570
It's like playing golf.
You get good hits with good form.

46:22.610 --> 46:24.440
Got a place to practice?

46:51.840 --> 46:55.640
Tomorrow, let's go on a picnic, okay?

47:18.570 --> 47:20.530
That's right. A picnic...

48:05.880 --> 48:10.910
<i>For the longest time, Geum-ja has
wanted to meet with Won-mo...</i>

48:11.180 --> 48:13.180
<i>And ask for his forgiveness.</i>

48:14.290 --> 48:21.660
<i>She'd be very unhappy if she
found out he appeared before Jenny.</i>

48:50.460 --> 48:54.620
Weekends with the family, and the dog...
Right?

50:42.340 --> 50:43.600
Oppa.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.200
Oppa.

50:59.650 --> 51:00.720
Appa.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.110
Appa.

51:04.290 --> 51:05.320
Jenny.

52:51.630 --> 52:52.720
Honey...

52:53.030 --> 52:54.160
Honey...

52:56.570 --> 53:00.670
I'm meeting with friends later today.

53:02.510 --> 53:06.040
I'll have your dinner ready
before I leave.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.310
Would you mind?

53:10.520 --> 53:14.450
Don't you be the one to pay for dinner.

53:15.020 --> 53:15.990
Right...

53:16.690 --> 53:20.390
Park Yi-jeong: Time served 1993-1999

54:27.560 --> 54:29.660
Hey, harlot.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.590
You parasite, living off of men's blood.

54:36.170 --> 54:38.630
I've got just the job
for a slut like you.

55:01.330 --> 55:04.020
You know how itchy it is when you get
bit on the sole of your foot?

55:06.430 --> 55:09.090
What did I tell you? What did I say!

55:09.400 --> 55:10.970
It tickles when you scratch...

55:11.410 --> 55:13.270
and it itches when you don't scratch.

55:13.340 --> 55:18.140
Itches if you don't scratch,
and tickles when you do. Right?

55:18.380 --> 55:25.240
You slut! Itches if you don't scratch
and tickles when you do...

55:50.280 --> 55:52.500
I used to have a strong stomach.

55:55.050 --> 55:56.910
I don't know what the problem is...

55:57.150 --> 55:58.140
Here...

56:08.590 --> 56:12.430
Sorry. Nasty, huh?

56:13.700 --> 56:16.690
That's quite alright.
I enjoy helping you.

56:19.240 --> 56:24.940
Thanks, Geum-ja. You really are
kind-hearted.

56:27.850 --> 56:33.540
You understand that I only like
plump girls, right?

56:35.890 --> 56:41.520
Of course. I'll eat a lot, too
and plump up for you.

56:42.060 --> 56:47.760
So, you just keep taking lots of food
and medicine...

56:54.840 --> 56:56.100
And hurry up and die.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.880
- She fed her bleach?
- Really?

57:00.650 --> 57:03.010
- For how long?
- Three years.

57:04.850 --> 57:07.510
What a clean stomach she must've had.

57:09.190 --> 57:13.450
- Geum-ja the Kind-hearted
- Well done, her!

57:14.060 --> 57:17.820
<i>After that, Geum-ja inherited the
"Witch" nickname...</i>

57:18.260 --> 57:20.930
<i>But was also still referred to as
"Kind-hearted Geum-ja"</i>

57:21.970 --> 57:24.990
<i>Everyone wanted to help Kind-hearted
Geum-ja...</i>

57:25.370 --> 57:29.440
<i>And no one could refuse the Witch
any favors.</i>

57:29.710 --> 57:31.100
It has to be tonight.

57:31.510 --> 57:33.940
I can't take it any more.
Not even for you.

57:35.110 --> 57:39.680
<i>Soo-kyoung, a thief released before me
found out where Baek was working.</i>

57:40.450 --> 57:43.950
<i>Seong-eun, a smart college grad...</i>

57:44.120 --> 57:45.890
<i>was later released and got a job
at the same place.</i>

57:46.460 --> 57:50.490
<i>She then informed me of Baek's
intention of getting a new car.</i>

57:50.800 --> 57:52.890
<i>Later, Baek was visited by</i>

57:53.170 --> 57:55.330
<i>a pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong.</i>

58:44.820 --> 58:47.450
It'll be used wisely
for the Lord's work.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.360
Hello?

59:00.930 --> 59:01.800
Darling.

59:03.770 --> 59:05.230
Have you had dinner?

59:06.640 --> 59:08.660
I'll wait and have it with you.

59:09.910 --> 59:12.540
You can go ahead without me.

59:14.580 --> 59:19.180
I'll wait for you, so hurry back.

59:22.360 --> 59:26.020
He hasn't eaten yet. I'll go and make
him eat first.

59:26.260 --> 59:28.160
It's okay. Don't worry.

59:28.730 --> 59:29.750
Bye.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.000
<i>Geum-ja.</i>

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.910
<i>At that moment, Geum-ja held her
breath and struggled to break free.</i>

01:02:53.730 --> 01:03:00.660
<i>Even in this desperate situation
she never forgot the gun's firing range.</i>

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:45.800
Got an English-Korean dictionary?

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:53.200
Don't think that I forgive you.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.580
I think mothers who dump their kids
should go to jail.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.020
When I was younger, I often thought of
taking revenge out on you.

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:10.330
But I couldn't imagine the thought of
killing you.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.090
Reason being that, I didn't know what
your face looked like.

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:22.340
Anyway, since we're on better terms
now, give me your reasons at least.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:29.140
Saying sorry is not enough
You should say sorry at least 3 times.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.510
Ungenerously your daughter, Jenny.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.330
Left turn.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.010
Okay?

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.870
I was happy...

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.960
I'm truly sorry.

01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.080
Farewell.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:30.600
<i>Get up, teacher! Time to go to work!</i>

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.050
Geum-ja, what's with that eye shadow?

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.090
Do you know why those kids-

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.720
Hey! Here's another one!

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:20.260
Hello?

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:34.300
If you'd found the real killer back then...
These children wouldn't have died, right?

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:38.780
You know how this feels.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.250
There were four!

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.670
- I told you I can't come to work today.
- It's not that...

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:07.110
- Someone's here looking for you.
- Who?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.550
- Well, the thing is.
- They won't say who they are?

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.480
I don't know what they're saying.

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:24.990
Can you speak Japanese?

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.870
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.070
<i>Please hurry and come get me...</i>

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.250
<i>Mommy...</i>

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.180
<i>There, there.
Don't cry. Don't cry...</i>

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.840
<i>Mommy... please hurry.</i>

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.890
<i>Mommy, I want to go home.
Please hurry, mommy.</i>

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.220
<i>There, there...
Don't cry. Don't cry.</i>

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:40.420
<i>Mommy, where are you?</i>

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:53.710
I know it's difficult
but take a good look at this man.

01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:59.450
Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995.

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:11.360
<i>Dad... I can't...</i>

01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:14.700
<i>Daddy.</i>

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440
This is Eun-joo, in '96.

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.870
<i>I can't breathe...</i>

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:31.850
<i>I'm scared. Please don't kill me, sir.</i>

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:42.420
Wait just a minute.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.650
This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000.

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:15.520
<i>Mommy.</i>

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:05.070
He was a teacher at English schools
in affluent neighborhoods.

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:11.210
He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill
them, then move on to another school.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.610
He'd never pick a child from one of
his own classes.

01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:16.910
Which is why he was never under any suspicion.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.020
- Coffee or green tea?
Which is why he was never under any suspicion.

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:25.820
Children annoyed him, so he would
tape them right after kidnapping them...

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:27.620
And killed them straight away.

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:34.230
The voices you heard on the line while
negotiating the ransom...

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:37.740
were taped off the videos
after the kids were already dead.

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.110
Now, you have two options.

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:48.510
If you want lawful punishment...

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.220
We will hand him over to
Chief Choi here.

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:56.530
But if you want a speedier
more personalized death for him...

01:23:56.730 --> 01:24:00.060
You can have it right here and now.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.060
Does he have a child of his own?

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.230
He is supposed to be sterile.

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:09.700
Then what did he need all that
money for?

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.100
He put it in the bank.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.910
Of course, the money will all
be returned to you-

01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:19.910
With no kid, what did he need
all that money for?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.500
He... was going to buy a yacht.

01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:51.780
The police have big sticks but they
don't know how to use them.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.580
If we leave it to them, there'd be
nothing but never-ending trials...

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.110
And all those bloody reporters...

01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:01.280
How about we leave it to Geum-ja?

01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:04.930
It'd be easier since
she's been to jail and all.

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.530
That's cowardly! They're our kids.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:13.470
Then, let each person choose if
they want to be in or not.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.300
I'm for individual choice.

01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:18.170
Why don't you just let him choose
his own death or trial, then...

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.600
Individually?

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:22.110
Little while ago, you wanted to
hand him over to the police.

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:24.180
Then you wanted to leave it up
to Geum-ja...

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.710
Now you want to be left out alone?
What the hell do you want?

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.310
Won-mo's family has to follow the
majority, too.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.340
You know that, right?

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:56.570
She has a weak heart...

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:00.910
Hey, mine's weak, too.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:04.150
Then Won-mo's father can represent
the family.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:07.160
One person per family should
be enough.

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:08.910
Alright?

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.620
What if Won-mo's mom informs
on us later?

01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:15.100
She couldn't.
Her husband's in on it, too.

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:17.300
They could always get divorced.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:20.400
We can leave some evidence, then.

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:23.870
How about we all take a picture?
So that...

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.010
even if we feel guilty later-
- Guilty?

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:29.750
Guilt for killing that bastard?

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:34.040
We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him
when we had him. That's guilt!

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:36.580
Let me say a word.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.800
I killed when I was in prison...

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.620
I'm also the one who caught Baek after
13 years of planning...

01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:55.730
If anyone here informs the police...

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.970
I won't say any more.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.810
Shall we go in one at a time?
Or all together at once?

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.120
One at a time for what?
Let's just go finish him off.

01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:14.430
There's no need to share such a
personal matter with other families.

01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:16.750
Isn't that right, dad?

01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:24.700
Won't it be scary going in alone?
And it could be dangerous.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.600
Just think of it as using the toilet.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.030
In any case, it's a private affair.

01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:33.040
Each to his own. A la carte...

01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:37.880
We don't all have to get the same
set menu.

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.510
Please, honey...

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.280
We're divorced
This isn't a couples thing!

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.120
We don't have to go in together.

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:56.560
Excuse me, I think...

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.800
- It'd be too easy if we
did it all together. - Honey!

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.670
I brought along a sedative.

01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:15.280
You couldn't even touch that finger
remember?

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.620
<i>Alright, then...</i>

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.240
<i>Won-mo's father is out, and his mother
will go in alone...</i>

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.300
<i>Jae-kyoung's and Dong-hwa's are
going in together...</i>

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:39.910
- Is that right?
- Yes!

01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:41.670
Let's do it then!

01:28:43.410 --> 01:28:45.680
Wait! Just a second!

01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:54.720
Shouldn't we decide what order you
go in?

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.840
Will that be enough for you?

01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:52.680
I can lend you mine after.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:56.010
Well...

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.120
I think I'll be okay.

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:17.700
Honey...

01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:31.280
Everyone pay attention.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.290
If you grip it like this, the tip of the
knife will slip and not penetrate deeply.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.560
You could also cut your hand.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.870
So grip it like this
at all times, please.

01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:49.830
Or you could just...

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:56.880
stab him like this.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.770
Why did you do it?

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.780
You look like a normal person.

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.080
Why?

01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:50.770
Ma'am, there's no such thing as
a perfect person.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.350
This...

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.200
isn't going to bring our son back
is it, honey?

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.830
Right?

01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:21.190
You all look very well off.
Take a look at that.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:26.460
She took her boots off,
so's not to get blood on the suede.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.760
Does that make any sense to you here?

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:38.400
My mom had to scrub hotel floors to
send my brother to that school.

01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:43.310
We ran around like dogs to come up
with the ransom.

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.050
Now we've lost our house and our
relatives won't see us.

01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:53.860
My daughter-in-law killed herself and
my son left the country.

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:57.920
We all have our own stories to tell.

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.310
Dad!

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:17.610
We're not the last, dad. Eun-joo's
grandma's still waiting her turn.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.210
Dad...

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:38.960
Come on, give me a hand!

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:43.200
Mister, get up.

01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:46.300
Please. Get a hold of yourself!

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.740
I'm sorry, but...

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.910
Could you step aside a moment?

01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:21.250
Thank you.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.720
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:11.420
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:19.310
<i>Happy birthday dear...</i>

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:30.610
I'm sorry.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.360
It felt like a birthday to me...

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:38.920
We can say it is, then.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.560
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.000
<i>to you!</i>

01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:40.310
Will you wire the money into
our accounts?

01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.530
My account number.

01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:03.910
In France...

01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:07.650
when there's a break in the
conversation like this...

01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:11.810
they say an angel is passing.

01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:38.400
It's snowing!

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.500
It's snowing a lot.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:46.480
- When did it all pile up so much?
- What time is it now?

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.410
The traffic...

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.150
The roads will freeze soon.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.630
Won-mo.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.530
I have...

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.370
<i>Along the path on green grass...</i>

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:27.340
<i>A lady in red heels goes...</i>

01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:34.920
<i>Click, click, click with her heels
Where might she be going?</i>

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:40.520
<i>Won't she look back...</i>

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:42.550
Are you really going to send Jenny back?

01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:46.020
<i>...back my way for a glance?</i>

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.560
Are you?

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.160
<i>One step, two...</i>

01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:59.840
<i>The lady in red heels takes another
step away, alone...</i>

01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:20.190
<i>Lee Geum-ja made a great mistake
in her youth...</i>

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:23.730
<i>And used other people to achieve
her own goals...</i>

01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:30.130
<i>But she still couldn't find
the redemption she so desired.</i>

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.290
<i>In spite of this...</i>

01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:50.420
<i>Actually, because of this...</i>

01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:55.930
<i>I liked Geum-ja.</i>

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.380
<i>Farewell...</i>

01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:13.420
<i>Geum-ja.</i>
