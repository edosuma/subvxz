00:17.400 --> 00:19.643
I think I'll go back to the room.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.686
Yeah, you don't want to burn.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.740
You've been out here
for, what, 10 minutes?

00:25.775 --> 00:27.821
What happened to
the bathing suit I bought you?

00:27.856 --> 00:29.953
I'm wearing it...
underneath.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.752
- You're not gonna even try?
- I am what I am.

00:32.787 --> 00:34.633
Well, you do
what you want.

00:34.668 --> 00:38.546
This is my first vacation in three years,
and I'm gonna make every minute count.

00:38.581 --> 00:42.645
I tried doing that once...
making every minute count.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.696
- It gave me a headache.
- What doesn't?

00:46.287 --> 00:49.974
Hey, Mom. You owe me
an ice cream sundae.

00:50.009 --> 00:53.490
We had a bet. Mom said you
wouldn't come outside even once.

00:53.525 --> 00:55.555
Oh, ye of little faith.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.125
Yeah!

01:00.350 --> 01:03.495
- Hey, Mom, can I goJet Skiing?
- No, it's too scary.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.727
No, it's not.
All the other kids...

01:05.762 --> 01:08.389
Not for you.
For Mr. Monk.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.642
There's nothing to do.

01:10.677 --> 01:12.075
Here. Here.

01:12.110 --> 01:14.566
Take a quarter,
look in the telescope.

01:14.601 --> 01:16.595
The telescope?

01:16.630 --> 01:18.300
Big whoop.

01:21.022 --> 01:22.871
Do you have any lotion on?

01:22.906 --> 01:24.497
Come here.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.163
Hey, look. I can see our room.

01:36.929 --> 01:40.384
- And, uh, there's Mr. Monk's room.
- Which one?

01:40.419 --> 01:43.669
The first one. The one he couldn't
stay in because it smelled funny.

01:55.630 --> 01:58.115
- Mom.
- What?

01:59.899 --> 02:01.982
Benjy, what's wrong?

02:02.852 --> 02:04.251
What's wrong?

02:10.964 --> 02:15.162
MONK Season 1 Epi. 9
Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation

03:02.978 --> 03:04.213
Mom, she was stabbed.

03:04.248 --> 03:05.372
- I really think she's dead.
- I know.

03:05.407 --> 03:08.229
I know. I know. I'm so
sorry you had to see that.

03:08.264 --> 03:10.197
But it's gonna be okay. Mr. Monk is gonna

03:10.198 --> 03:12.365
check it out with the
security people. Look.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.540
Miss Bronwynn,
this is not a penitentiary.

03:14.575 --> 03:16.594
You have to let these
people come and go.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.553
I'm gonna let 'em go, Tony,
as soon as we check out Room 401.

03:19.588 --> 03:23.319
Do you know who is in
Room 401? John Fenimore.

03:23.354 --> 03:26.300
The C. O. O. Of the third-largest
brokerage house on the West Coast.

03:26.335 --> 03:28.854
He brings his staff here
every year for a conference.

03:28.889 --> 03:31.046
How do we know the boy
just didn't make it up?

03:31.081 --> 03:33.651
Oh, no. He's...
He's a good boy. He doesn't lie.

03:33.686 --> 03:36.776
- All children lie.
- Not him. Not to me.

03:36.811 --> 03:38.749
Of course you would say that.
You're his father.

03:38.784 --> 03:41.377
I am not his father.
His mother works for me.

03:41.412 --> 03:44.046
Tony Landis,
this is Adrian Monk.

03:44.081 --> 03:46.416
Adrian is a former
homicide detective.

03:46.451 --> 03:50.040
I just talked to his captain in Frisco.
He says we're lucky to have him.

03:50.075 --> 03:53.792
Miss Bronwynn,
these people are on vacation.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.817
Okay, Tony. Tell you what.

03:55.852 --> 03:57.305
Why don't you let 'em out,

03:57.340 --> 04:03.405
and then you can tell the victim's family
and the police why you let the murderer go.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.047
Fine.
Check it out.

04:06.284 --> 04:09.864
As discreetly and quickly
and discreetly as possible.

04:09.899 --> 04:13.600
You... You said discreetly twice.

04:14.064 --> 04:15.730
Exactly.

04:15.765 --> 04:17.870
In fact, I'll say it again.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.502
Discreetly.

04:24.617 --> 04:27.815
Mitzi. Mitzi.

04:27.873 --> 04:29.570
Mitzi.

04:29.693 --> 04:34.427
Muy importante.
Did anyone come out of Room 401?

04:34.462 --> 04:35.760
No, ma'am.

04:35.795 --> 04:40.653
Okay. Go in there, close
the door and be very quiet.

04:46.943 --> 04:50.568
Mr. Fenimore, could you open
the door, please? Hotel security.

05:01.931 --> 05:03.809
What?

05:10.384 --> 05:12.422
You want me to
go in backwards?

05:12.457 --> 05:15.664
No, no, no.
On three, I go in high.

05:15.699 --> 05:18.007
You follow me.

05:18.042 --> 05:20.605
- Stay low.
- Got it.

05:20.949 --> 05:23.054
Do I have something on my nose?

05:23.089 --> 05:25.849
Oh. No.
That's just from The Sting.

05:25.884 --> 05:27.368
What sting?

05:27.403 --> 05:30.544
No, the movie The Sting.
They were always doing this.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.197
What does it mean?

05:32.232 --> 05:33.607
I don't know.

05:33.763 --> 05:37.041
Okay. One, two, three.

05:37.451 --> 05:40.496
Hotel security.
Is anybody here?

05:41.171 --> 05:42.715
What do you think?

05:43.726 --> 05:45.642
It's gotta be the wrong room.

05:45.677 --> 05:47.834
Benjy pointed it out.

05:48.003 --> 05:52.036
He said, "Fourth floor,
last room on the right."

05:52.071 --> 05:53.896
Well, do you see anything?
Looks pretty clean.

05:53.931 --> 05:57.073
No, nothing. Not a thing.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.497
Tell me about Benjy.

05:59.981 --> 06:02.391
He's a good kid. He's...

06:02.663 --> 06:07.700
He wants to be a writer.
He draws comic books.

06:09.529 --> 06:13.093
He said it-it happened right here.

06:14.163 --> 06:15.660
He said she pulled
the curtain down.

06:15.695 --> 06:17.600
Mr. Monk, all due respect.

06:17.635 --> 06:20.651
I've seen crime scenes.
This ain't one.

06:22.343 --> 06:23.416
What the hell?

06:23.451 --> 06:25.220
Mr. Fenimore.
How you doing?

06:25.255 --> 06:29.552
I'm Rita Bronwynn, hotel security.
This is Adrian Monk. He's assisting me.

06:29.734 --> 06:30.984
Assisting you with what?

06:31.019 --> 06:33.292
There's been a report
of an incident in this room.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.387
- What sort of incident?
- A fight.

06:35.422 --> 06:38.263
Here? No.
Someone made a mistake.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.998
When did you leave this room, sir?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.560
- About an hour ago.
- And where did you go?

06:42.595 --> 06:45.008
Down by the lake.
I fed some ducks.

06:45.043 --> 06:46.816
- With your wife.
- No. I was alone.

06:46.851 --> 06:48.171
Where is your wife
at the present moment?

06:48.206 --> 06:49.931
Drove into town to
do some shopping.

06:49.966 --> 06:51.886
When did this incident
supposedly occur?

06:51.921 --> 06:53.390
About 15 minutes ago.

06:53.425 --> 06:55.308
Well, then it couldn't
have been Irene.

06:55.343 --> 06:57.127
She called me
on my cell just now.

06:57.162 --> 07:00.667
You and your wife are
having problems, sir?

07:00.846 --> 07:02.102
Why would you say that?

07:02.137 --> 07:03.885
You're not sleeping
in the same room.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.697
There's a travel alarm on the end table
and some slippers under the couch.

07:09.022 --> 07:12.303
You're a very clever man.
Yes, we had an argument.

07:12.338 --> 07:17.047
We made up this morning. Twice,
if, uh, you understand what I mean.

07:17.128 --> 07:18.459
Yeah.

07:18.494 --> 07:22.175
Mr. Fenimore, can you have your wife
call the front desk as soon as she gets in?

07:22.210 --> 07:23.284
If you insist.

07:23.319 --> 07:27.574
Oh, sir, do you happen
to have a picture of your wife?

07:27.609 --> 07:29.766
Yeah. Sure.

07:32.894 --> 07:35.620
Well? Is this the woman you saw?

07:35.655 --> 07:38.030
I don't know. Maybe.

07:38.571 --> 07:39.935
Sorry.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.752
Benjy, wait here
for one sec, okay?

07:41.787 --> 07:42.891
Okay.

07:45.902 --> 07:49.122
What did you find? - Zilch. It was
the cleanest room I've ever seen.

07:49.157 --> 07:51.978
- Really?
- I'd stay there.

07:53.538 --> 07:55.984
- Adrian, I hate to say this...
- What?

07:56.146 --> 07:58.577
- Maybe he did make it up.
- Why would he do that?

07:58.612 --> 08:01.274
To impress you. Maybe
he's trying to get your attention.

08:01.309 --> 08:03.418
You're talking about me, aren't you?

08:03.453 --> 08:06.790
- I saw what I saw.
- He saw what he saw.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.077
Okay. You two have fun
playing cops and robbers.

08:10.112 --> 08:13.626
I'm still on vacation, and I'm
gonna play tennis with somebody.

08:13.661 --> 08:17.498
- You made a friend?
- Yeah. You should try it sometime.

08:18.906 --> 08:21.044
And there he is.

08:21.079 --> 08:23.296
- Hey!
- Hey.

08:23.331 --> 08:24.889
I was just about
to call your room.

08:24.924 --> 08:26.853
My Sharona.

08:26.888 --> 08:28.124
??

08:28.159 --> 08:31.533
Uh, no, no, no. That was...
That was the first time.

08:31.568 --> 08:34.044
Uh, this is my boss,
Adrian Monk,

08:34.080 --> 08:36.585
- and my son Benjy.
- Hey, how you doing, guys?

08:36.620 --> 08:39.049
So,

08:39.083 --> 08:40.676
- what do you think?
- You look great.

08:40.711 --> 08:42.426
I won't be able to
keep my eye on the ball.

08:42.461 --> 08:44.105
Exactly my plan.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.803
I'll take them.

08:46.257 --> 08:48.466
Okay, I'll see you two later.

08:48.954 --> 08:51.167
And don't let him
get into any trouble.

08:51.202 --> 08:53.076
I won't.

08:53.111 --> 08:54.915
I was talkin' to Benjy.

09:05.797 --> 09:07.314
Good shot!

09:08.631 --> 09:10.538
Mom could have got that shot.

09:10.782 --> 09:13.855
- Do you think she's letting him win?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

09:13.890 --> 09:16.096
You know, why do girls do that?

09:16.131 --> 09:18.769
Someday you'll understand.

09:18.804 --> 09:21.551
When you do, call me
and explain it to me.

09:21.722 --> 09:25.348
Now, I want you to tell me
again exactly what you saw.

09:25.383 --> 09:26.653
Okay.

09:30.226 --> 09:32.180
Do you see anything?

09:32.385 --> 09:37.216
No. It looks as clean
from the outside as inside.

09:45.473 --> 09:48.242
Mr. Fenimore.
He's talking to a woman.

09:48.277 --> 09:50.187
I can't see her face.

09:50.222 --> 09:53.258
But it's definitely not his wife.

09:53.392 --> 09:57.496
- Benjy, can you read lips?
- I'm in sixth grade.

09:57.713 --> 10:00.212
I can barely read words.

10:03.842 --> 10:05.976
- Yeah. Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here.

10:06.011 --> 10:09.101
Fenimore, John P.
Well, he's a big fish.

10:09.136 --> 10:11.780
Chief Operating Officer
for Marin Bay Investments.

10:11.815 --> 10:14.003
Makes a lot of money
for a lot of people, Monk.

10:14.038 --> 10:18.058
Oh, here's a red flag.
He was indicted three years ago.

10:18.093 --> 10:20.949
Domestic thing. A fight
with his wife got out of hand.

10:20.984 --> 10:23.568
She dropped the
charges the next day.

10:23.603 --> 10:26.189
- Is that it?
- Yep. That's it.

10:26.224 --> 10:29.332
So, uh, would you like to
tell me what's going on?

10:29.367 --> 10:32.916
I think this time he might
have killed his wife.

10:32.951 --> 10:34.901
Where are you staying, Monk?
The Bates Motel?

10:34.936 --> 10:39.420
No. But I have a feeling this place
is run by the same company.

10:39.578 --> 10:41.122
She can't just quit.

10:41.157 --> 10:43.686
Her boyfriend called
from Buenos Aires.

10:43.721 --> 10:47.194
We have the Labor Day weekend around
the corner and we're at full capacity.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.575
She can't quit now.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.094
- Is there a problem?
- Lupe Olivencia just quit.

10:56.129 --> 10:59.887
We ought to start giving them
gold watches after three weeks.

11:01.696 --> 11:06.095
Basta, tu ganaste.
All right. Mrs. Garcia,

11:06.130 --> 11:09.795
everybody does double shifts
and I'll pay the overtime.

11:09.830 --> 11:12.754
- Tony, I wanted to ask you something.
- What's going on?

11:13.013 --> 11:16.104
Oh, nothing. Doors are open.
People can come and go as they please.

11:16.139 --> 11:19.781
- Well, how magnanimous of you.
- But we still have to search the bags.

11:19.816 --> 11:22.851
Why? - He's going to
try to dispose of the body.

11:22.886 --> 11:25.270
- What body?
- Mrs. Fenimore.

11:25.305 --> 11:27.359
And your theory is
based on what?

11:27.394 --> 11:29.122
Benjy witnessed a murder.

11:29.157 --> 11:32.336
And I saw Mr. Fenimore
flirting with another woman.

11:32.371 --> 11:36.507
Most likely his assistant.
Her name is Nicole Young.

11:36.542 --> 11:40.219
She comes with Mr. Fenimore
and his staff here every year.

11:40.254 --> 11:43.545
Look, the point is
Mrs. Fenimore is M. I. A.

11:43.580 --> 11:46.662
Tony, remember last Christmas,
that jewelry was stolen?

11:46.697 --> 11:50.791
You didn't listen to me. I believe
you were reprimanded for that.

11:50.826 --> 11:52.461
Fine!

11:52.496 --> 11:55.228
All right.
You have one hour.

11:55.263 --> 11:58.482
After that, the siege is over,
and we're back to normal.

11:58.517 --> 12:02.813
Yeah. - Or what passes for normal
around here. Are you happy now?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.621
I'm never happy.

12:04.656 --> 12:09.490
Listen, I might have to stay an extra day
or two until we get this sorted out.

12:09.525 --> 12:12.253
Oh, impossible.
Quite out of the question.

12:12.288 --> 12:15.070
- We're overbooked as it is.
- Copy that. We're on our way.

12:15.105 --> 12:17.246
Monk. They're
heading for her room.

12:17.281 --> 12:18.773
We only have one hour.

12:20.538 --> 12:22.730
Mr. Fenimore, sir.

12:23.081 --> 12:25.100
Hi. Remember us?

12:25.135 --> 12:27.225
Yes, unfortunately.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.937
We've got a couple
questions to ask you.

12:28.972 --> 12:31.127
Can't it wait? The Hong Kong
market's about to open.

12:31.162 --> 12:33.698
Oh, is that what
they're calling it now?

12:33.733 --> 12:37.190
Actually, ma'am,
the Hong Kong market's closed today.

12:37.225 --> 12:40.206
It's a national holiday...
what they call Liberation Day.

12:40.241 --> 12:43.404
Open the door, would you, ma'am?
We can talk inside.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.842
Would you mind telling me
what the hell this is all about?

12:48.877 --> 12:54.519
Mr. Fenimore, I am 65 to 70% sure
that you murdered your wife.

12:59.974 --> 13:02.213
Surprise!

13:03.770 --> 13:05.477
Oh, my... I forgot all about it!

13:05.512 --> 13:07.943
- Oh, my goodness.
- Happy birthday, darling.

13:07.978 --> 13:10.375
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

13:10.817 --> 13:16.278
Mr. Monk, I'd like you
to meet Irene... my wife.

13:16.313 --> 13:18.236
Darling, Mr. Monk is a detective,

13:18.271 --> 13:22.224
and he thinks I killed you
in our suite this morning.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.359
I think I'd remember.

13:27.851 --> 13:30.212
Anything else?

13:30.950 --> 13:32.688
Happy birthday.

13:36.685 --> 13:40.860
Miss Bronwynn is a detective too,
just like Mr. Monk.

13:40.895 --> 13:43.576
And you know what she has?
She has a shoulder holster.

13:43.611 --> 13:45.072
Really.

13:47.071 --> 13:48.446
That's good.
Is that a new one?

13:48.481 --> 13:50.944
Yeah, it's, um...
it's called Captain Invisible.

13:50.979 --> 13:52.028
I like it.

13:52.063 --> 13:53.665
Okay, honey.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.030
I'll be back around 10:00. You're
gonna stay with Mr. Monk tonight, right?

13:57.065 --> 13:59.113
Yeah. We're just
gonna go to the arcade.

13:59.148 --> 14:00.613
That should be fun.

14:00.648 --> 14:01.998
Benjy.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.054
How do I look?

14:04.195 --> 14:05.045
Different.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.646
Good. That's
what I was going for.

14:08.051 --> 14:10.363
- Mom.
- What?

14:10.398 --> 14:14.445
You believe me, don't you,
about the, uh, lady getting killed.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.838
You know, I, uh... I-I've
been thinking a lot about that, and...

14:19.839 --> 14:21.541
maybe you were just using your imagination

14:21.542 --> 14:23.406
like you do when you're
drawing comic books.

14:23.441 --> 14:26.644
I wasn't.
Why won't you believe me?

14:26.679 --> 14:28.726
Hey, look, Benjy.

14:28.761 --> 14:30.643
There's no body.

14:30.678 --> 14:34.418
It was a mistake, and that's a good thing
because it means nobody was really hurt.

14:34.453 --> 14:36.713
Mr. Monk believes me.

14:39.563 --> 14:41.284
So, what, you're
giving up now or what?

14:41.319 --> 14:44.530
- Nobody's giving up, Miss Bronwynn.
- Oh, you can call me Bronwynn.

14:44.565 --> 14:48.809
I just... I just need to look
after the boy for an hour or two.

14:48.844 --> 14:52.725
Oh, I can see it now.
I'm gonna be all alone doing this.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.963
Mr. Monk, would
you like a toothpick?

14:54.998 --> 14:57.112
I like 'em minty.
You care for one?

14:57.147 --> 14:59.766
No, thanks. - You sure?
They're individually wrapped.

14:59.801 --> 15:00.805
Okay.

15:22.510 --> 15:24.532
Did you check out
Fenimore's room again?

15:24.567 --> 15:26.821
- From top to bottom.
- Did you find anything?

15:26.856 --> 15:28.363
Zip. It's clean.

15:28.398 --> 15:32.446
It's like an operating room up there.
I even rented one of these things.

15:32.481 --> 15:34.024
Spectra-light.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.478
- Infrared.
- Yeah. L-I-I've heard of these.

15:36.513 --> 15:38.739
Yeah? Have you seen
the new model?

15:39.037 --> 15:41.594
It's awesome.

15:41.629 --> 15:44.545
It checks 14 different bodily fluids.

15:44.580 --> 15:48.043
- Fourteen?
- Yeah. Uh, blood, saliva, semen...

15:48.078 --> 15:51.210
Okay. That-That-That's okay.
Thank you.

15:51.245 --> 15:53.212
- How does it work?
- I'll show you.

15:53.247 --> 15:54.683
Here. Wait.

15:54.718 --> 15:56.367
I gotta turn these lights off.

16:18.089 --> 16:21.047
Turn, plea...
Turn it off, please. God, please.

16:30.052 --> 16:32.341
I think I'd like to switch rooms.

16:32.376 --> 16:34.653
We're all booked up.

16:46.782 --> 16:49.790
- Front desk.
- Housekeeping?

16:49.825 --> 16:52.315
You see them? Fluids.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.675
- Fluids?
- Bodily fluids.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.814
I'm gonna need
everything scrubbed.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.371
S-Scrubbed.
How do you say "scrubbed"?

16:59.406 --> 17:00.762
- Scrubbed.
- Scrubbed.

17:00.797 --> 17:04.243
The curtains, the carpeting.
And did you bring bleach?

17:04.279 --> 17:05.449
- Bleach?
- Bleach!

17:05.483 --> 17:08.430
The white god.
Dios blanco.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.005
Good. That's good.
Okay, take your time.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.920
Don't worry. I'll pay extra.
Whatever it takes.

17:13.954 --> 17:17.429
Don't you worry, partner.
They're a team of experts.

17:17.464 --> 17:19.928
I'm going downstairs
to look for the stiff.

17:19.963 --> 17:21.435
Good luck, ladies.

17:21.909 --> 17:23.512
Good luck, ladies.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.319
And God be with you.

17:30.794 --> 17:32.420
He's your boss, right?

17:32.455 --> 17:35.185
- So why do you two vacation together?
- I don't have a choice.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.757
The last time I tried to go without him,
I had to come home after two days.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.750
- Was he ill?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:40.785 --> 17:42.701
It was just a garbage strike.

17:42.736 --> 17:47.134
The bags were piling up on the street.
He was almost catatonic. You know.

17:47.249 --> 17:50.459
- That's like a marriage.
- More like a bad marriage.

17:52.552 --> 17:56.281
So, um, have you
ever been married, or...

17:56.316 --> 17:59.596
Me? Oh, no.
I mean, I'm allergic to rice.

18:17.506 --> 18:19.631
That's blood.

18:41.135 --> 18:43.149
Come on.

18:43.337 --> 18:45.759
- Oh, it's too wrinkled.
- Okay, here.

18:45.794 --> 18:47.411
Try one of mine.

18:50.558 --> 18:52.705
How do you keep
it looking like new?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.089
Hand-washed, no bleach.

18:54.124 --> 18:56.951
Tumble dry, medium heat. Cool iron.

18:57.215 --> 18:58.481
Okay.

19:05.150 --> 19:06.523
You got it?

19:11.252 --> 19:12.697
Someone's glasses.

19:12.732 --> 19:16.268
They're prescription. You'd think
somebody would come looking for them.

19:17.017 --> 19:19.428
What? - She was
wearing glasses.

19:19.463 --> 19:21.097
Who? The woman you saw?
The victim?

19:21.132 --> 19:22.749
- Yeah.
- Like these?

19:22.784 --> 19:23.949
I think so.

19:23.984 --> 19:25.843
Okay, look, I'm gonna
go find Bronwynn.

19:25.878 --> 19:27.495
- Put 'em right here.
- Okay.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.344
Can I leave you here
for a couple of minutes?

19:29.379 --> 19:30.672
- Okay.
- You stay right here?

19:30.707 --> 19:32.097
Yeah. Okay.

19:33.284 --> 19:34.258
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:34.293 --> 19:37.454
Please help me welcome back to
comedy night here at Hanover Lake Resort,

19:37.489 --> 19:41.672
the man on the top of the C. I. A. 's
Most Unwanted List, Chuck Byrn.

19:46.175 --> 19:48.137
Thanks very much, folks.
Thanks for coming.

19:48.172 --> 19:50.477
Have you seen Rita Bronwynn?

19:50.736 --> 19:53.255
No. - Could you page
her for me, please?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.576
It's very hot.
Unbelievably hot.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.619
It didn't say in the brochure this place was
located five blocks from the sun, did it?

20:00.614 --> 20:02.811
Oh, I went down to... I saw the
strangest thing on the beach.

20:02.846 --> 20:04.995
I was down there, walking
around on the beach and...

20:05.030 --> 20:06.478
Oh, my God.

20:06.513 --> 20:08.274
That's the guy.

20:08.309 --> 20:12.174
I saw that guy on the beach today,
and you know what he was wearing?

20:12.410 --> 20:14.584
The exact same thing
he's wearing right now.

20:14.619 --> 20:15.954
I couldn't believe it.

20:15.989 --> 20:17.793
How are ya?
What's your name, sir?

20:17.828 --> 20:21.565
- Adrian, don't tell him.
- Adrian? That's his name.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.621
That's a nice whisper.
I didn't pick up on it at all.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.349
Very quiet. Very effective.

20:25.384 --> 20:27.162
Adrian's your name.
Good to see you, Adrian.

20:27.197 --> 20:28.330
Thanks for coming
down to the show.

20:28.365 --> 20:31.162
Let's give Adrian a big hand
for coming down here, huh?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.370
Good to see ya.

20:32.405 --> 20:36.312
You kind of looked like a little bit like
a vampire out there on the beach today.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.721
I'm not a vampire.

20:40.756 --> 20:43.585
Good thing. We're all gonna
sleep better tonight knowing that.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.250
What are you doing here
with the peanuts here, Adrian?

20:48.270 --> 20:51.209
This bowl had more,
and I was helping to even them out.

20:51.244 --> 20:53.526
Evening out the peanuts.
It's an important job.

20:53.561 --> 20:55.944
I think we might have
hit the jackpot, folks.

20:56.053 --> 20:59.317
Get comfy, Adrian. We're gonna
be talking to you for a little while.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.411
Hey. I bet you it's
not really broken.

21:09.446 --> 21:12.396
They just want to make you think
that to play the 50 cent games.

21:12.887 --> 21:14.129
I gotta go.

21:27.960 --> 21:32.055
Now this is fascinating.
You keep your socks in Baggies.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.690
I really don't think
it's that unusual.

21:34.725 --> 21:37.260
You don't think it's that unusual?
Really. Maybe we could ask around.

21:37.295 --> 21:40.084
Does anyone else here
keep their socks in Baggies?

21:40.937 --> 21:43.084
No. Sorry, Adrian.

21:43.119 --> 21:44.678
I think you're a freak.

21:46.710 --> 21:49.235
Not so fast, Adrian. Not so fast.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.379
You don't leave a slot machine
when it's paying off, my friend.

21:51.414 --> 21:54.877
All right? So, you brought
your own soap to the hotel.

21:54.912 --> 21:56.098
That's right.

21:56.133 --> 21:59.919
I guess because the hotel soap,
that... that just wouldn't be clean?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.527
Towels. Did you
bring your own towels?

22:01.562 --> 22:03.503
- Yes.
- Sheets?

22:03.538 --> 22:05.449
- Pillowcases?
- Of course.

22:05.484 --> 22:07.775
Of course, yeah.

22:07.810 --> 22:12.160
You realize most people show up at hotels,
they show up so they can steal that crap?

22:12.195 --> 22:13.263
What are...
What are you doing?

22:13.298 --> 22:14.512
- What are you doing?
- Just...

22:14.547 --> 22:16.854
There was a little
fuzz on it, a little lint.

22:16.889 --> 22:18.790
Yeah, but that's my lint.
You can't take my lint. That's my lint.

22:18.825 --> 22:23.465
That's my area. That's where...
That's where I keep my lint.

22:23.570 --> 22:26.221
That's my safe lint spot.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.065
You really want to
pull it off of there, don't you?

22:29.254 --> 22:32.140
It's breaking you up inside, isn't it?

22:33.655 --> 22:36.727
Adrian, forget the fuzz. Forget it.

22:41.211 --> 22:43.327
There he goes, folks.
He's got his lint, huh?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.824
How about a big hand for him?
How proud you must be.

22:45.859 --> 22:47.853
You've got lint!

22:48.606 --> 22:50.229
Mom.

22:51.029 --> 22:54.180
Benjy. Benjy,
what's wrong? What is it?

22:54.215 --> 22:56.266
You sure you're okay?
You could have been killed.

22:56.301 --> 22:58.807
- I think that was the idea.
- You didn't get a good look at them?

22:58.842 --> 23:00.325
No. I'm sorry.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.492
Then when I went back,
the blood was gone.

23:02.527 --> 23:03.887
Someone had cleaned it up.

23:03.922 --> 23:05.495
Okay, it's right over here.

23:05.530 --> 23:08.637
Ninja Fury Four was out of order,
but this kid said it really wasn't.

23:08.672 --> 23:13.355
So when I went back to plug it in,
the back fell off and-and there she was.

23:18.771 --> 23:21.008
She was right there, Mom!
I saw her!

23:21.043 --> 23:23.469
They would have had
time to move the body.

23:28.777 --> 23:30.821
It was in there!
She was, like, all wrapped up.

23:30.856 --> 23:32.380
It was the same woman
you saw in the window?

23:32.415 --> 23:33.998
- I think so.
- Of course it was.

23:34.033 --> 23:36.827
Why go to the trouble of inventing
an entirely different victim?

23:36.862 --> 23:39.344
Tony. - I believe him.
And it isn't just Benjy.

23:39.379 --> 23:41.287
Somebody tried to
kill Miss Bronwynn.

23:41.322 --> 23:42.842
Really?

23:42.877 --> 23:46.266
But whoever it was wouldn't have
risked carrying it down the hallway.

23:50.789 --> 23:52.351
Who has the key to this door?

23:52.386 --> 23:55.799
The entire staff.
About 180 people.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.834
- Are you thinking inside job?
- Maybe it's that comedian.

23:58.869 --> 24:01.304
Wouldn't that be great?

24:03.510 --> 24:05.049
- Do you have a piece of paper?
- No.

24:05.084 --> 24:07.579
Isn't that a notepad
in your pocket?

24:18.402 --> 24:22.265
- It's lime?
- It's calcium oxide... quicklime.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.743
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's used to cover up smells.

24:25.778 --> 24:28.738
Smugglers use it to
fool drug-sniffing dogs.

24:28.773 --> 24:31.652
I've seen the mob use it
when they try to hide a body.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.654
You've seen the mob use it?

24:33.689 --> 24:36.411
I mean, in that movie
GoodFellas I saw it.

24:37.489 --> 24:39.795
- Actually, this is good news.
- How so?

24:39.830 --> 24:42.750
Because it means
the body's still in the hotel, right?

24:42.785 --> 24:45.268
So that means we have to
keep checking every bag going out.

24:45.303 --> 24:47.142
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

24:47.177 --> 24:49.005
Your time is up.
We had a deal.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.656
Oh, come on.
The deal is off, Tony!

24:50.691 --> 24:51.929
Work with us here.

24:51.964 --> 24:54.860
If they get rid of the body,
we have no case.

24:57.645 --> 25:02.220
I'll give you until noon tomorrow.
You'll be checking out then anyway.

25:02.255 --> 25:05.659
Tick, tick, tick.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.567
God, I hate it when
people go, "Tick, tick, tick."

25:14.759 --> 25:20.568
The body is still here...
in the hotel.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.919
I know it is.

25:22.954 --> 25:27.666
Somewhere inside this hotel.
But where?

25:27.747 --> 25:31.871
Adrian, you're ruining
the last hours of my vacation.

25:32.780 --> 25:37.138
- Hello? I'm solving a murder.
- Well, do it three feet to the left.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.731
Well, well. Here you are.

25:40.766 --> 25:43.577
- Here I am.
- So how about a rematch?

25:43.612 --> 25:47.442
- Are you a glutton for punishment?
- Oh, I'm a glutton for a lot of things.

25:47.477 --> 25:49.058
I bet you are.

25:49.093 --> 25:52.929
Okay, I'll book the court. And then
I'm gonna beat the pants off you.

25:52.964 --> 25:56.411
You wish.
I'll see you later.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.272
See ya.

26:01.398 --> 26:03.628
Do you like him?

26:07.138 --> 26:09.318
Why? Is there a reason
why I shouldn't?

26:11.367 --> 26:14.689
Adrian, if you know something about him,
you have to tell me. That's the rule.

26:14.724 --> 26:16.788
I thought the rule was
I should keep it to myself.

26:16.823 --> 26:18.513
Well, it's a new rule.

26:19.723 --> 26:24.139
Well, he, uh...
he might be married.

26:24.174 --> 26:27.654
- Might be or is?
- His wife's name is Julie. Or Julia.

26:27.689 --> 26:29.568
It was hard to read 'cause
the check was upside down.

26:29.603 --> 26:31.412
What check? - When he was
buying his sunglasses.

26:31.447 --> 26:34.334
There were two names.
It's a joint account.

26:35.733 --> 26:38.466
You know, you could be wrong.
You're not perfect.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.061
That's true.

26:40.096 --> 26:42.728
You were wrong about
Mr. Fenimore killing his wife.

26:42.763 --> 26:44.664
Maybe you're losing
your superpowers.

26:44.699 --> 26:46.373
Maybe I am.

26:47.413 --> 26:50.928
- What?
- The groundskeeper.

26:50.963 --> 26:53.078
He's using lime.

26:54.372 --> 26:57.595
I think you should take eight
or nine hours and check it out.

28:16.730 --> 28:18.761
Don't even think about moving.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.530
Who are you calling?

28:23.565 --> 28:25.704
Who do you think? Security.

28:25.739 --> 28:27.526
Security, extension 404.

28:27.561 --> 28:29.721
Give my regards to Bronwynn.

28:29.931 --> 28:33.320
- How do you know Bronwynn?
- I'm working with her on a case.

28:33.355 --> 28:36.581
Oh, yeah.
I've seen you with her.

28:36.616 --> 28:38.550
I'm Rawley.

28:40.922 --> 28:42.875
You want to tell me
what's going on?

28:42.910 --> 28:44.342
One second.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.792
- Why didn't you report it, Rawley?
- Report what?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.761
The missing bags of lime.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.563
How'd you know about that?

29:12.412 --> 29:14.481
I thought I could handle it myself.

29:14.516 --> 29:15.864
How many did they take?

29:15.899 --> 29:17.789
Three.

29:17.824 --> 29:22.054
- When did this happen?
- Sometime last night. That's all I know.

29:22.987 --> 29:24.811
Was that door locked?

29:24.846 --> 29:26.618
All the time. Dead bolt.

29:26.653 --> 29:28.954
I'm the only one with a key.

29:31.384 --> 29:33.308
What do they weigh?
About 40 pounds each?

29:33.343 --> 29:35.208
Fifty. Heavy bags.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.567
Locked door.

29:37.602 --> 29:39.665
They probably used the window.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.190
There had to be...

29:41.225 --> 29:43.684
There had to be
more than one person.

29:47.209 --> 29:50.047
I think we're looking for a gang.

29:51.171 --> 29:53.123
Did they move those pallet boards?

29:53.158 --> 29:55.488
They don't belong there.

30:00.705 --> 30:02.283
They were short.

30:02.318 --> 30:05.427
A short gang of lime thieves?

30:05.725 --> 30:08.131
It's a nutty world.

30:13.189 --> 30:15.690
Sweetheart,
where'd you learn that one?

30:27.233 --> 30:30.356
- Sweetheart, take it easy, will ya?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

30:30.530 --> 30:33.297
Why don't you have
Julie put some ice on it?

30:33.969 --> 30:36.600
Or is it Julia?

30:37.727 --> 30:39.259
It stinks in here.

30:39.294 --> 30:42.434
Oh, that's the...
the disinfectant.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.413
They cleaned the whole room.

30:46.377 --> 30:49.137
That's not the laundry.
That's the garbage.

30:49.172 --> 30:52.621
I know. Okay, so why
are you throwing it away?

30:52.656 --> 30:54.629
They were irredeemable.

30:54.664 --> 30:57.377
- Do you know what that means?
- Uh, yeah. They got dirty.

30:57.412 --> 30:58.780
Exactly.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.858
- Listen, I wanted to say thanks.
- For what?

31:01.893 --> 31:03.847
For believing me
when nobody else did.

31:03.882 --> 31:07.463
Though you probablyjust felt sorry
for me 'cause my dad's not around.

31:07.498 --> 31:11.597
Hey. I don't have to be
your father to believe you.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.437
Or to be proud of you.

31:13.472 --> 31:17.030
If you say you saw a body,
then something happened here.

31:17.065 --> 31:19.302
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.311
I've never seen
a room this clean.

31:23.346 --> 31:26.826
She must have worked all night.
Oh, it wasn't just one.

31:26.861 --> 31:29.182
It was a whole group of them.

31:29.217 --> 31:31.278
Four maids.

31:39.418 --> 31:42.267
A short gang.

31:43.611 --> 31:46.240
The maids.

31:51.985 --> 31:53.726
Okay.

31:53.876 --> 31:56.655
Just for the record,
what we just did...

31:56.690 --> 31:58.716
- Breaking and entering.
- Yeah.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.329
It's wrong, okay?
Don't-Don't do it.

32:01.364 --> 32:02.310
All right.

32:04.749 --> 32:07.865
- Where are we?
- The maids' locker room.

32:08.132 --> 32:12.244
- You think the dead body is in here?
- Maybe. It's been everywhere else.

32:18.070 --> 32:21.581
Look at this. Olivencia.
They were talking about her.

32:21.616 --> 32:23.608
She quit yesterday.

32:30.427 --> 32:31.553
What's wrong?

32:31.588 --> 32:34.776
She never changed back
into her street clothes.

32:34.975 --> 32:38.931
Benjy, the woman you saw...
the woman who was attacked...

32:38.966 --> 32:40.749
could she have been
a chambermaid?

32:40.784 --> 32:42.020
Maybe.

32:42.055 --> 32:45.381
Well, was she wearing
a dress something like this?

32:45.628 --> 32:47.762
Yeah, I think so.

32:47.844 --> 32:49.661
Good.

32:49.696 --> 32:52.532
At least we know
who we're looking for.

33:04.297 --> 33:06.075
What?

33:06.110 --> 33:08.075
That one tile.

33:08.110 --> 33:10.986
It's upside down.

33:39.444 --> 33:41.622
Oh, cool.

33:44.964 --> 33:47.312
What are they?

33:47.347 --> 33:50.836
They're digital cameras.
I've never seen them this small.

33:50.871 --> 33:52.498
What's that, a screen?

33:52.533 --> 33:54.341
Yeah.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.741
You see, you can see
the pictures they took.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.765
What is it?

34:01.338 --> 34:04.078
Financial documents.

34:04.272 --> 34:06.073
Okay, that's boring.

34:06.108 --> 34:08.159
No, no. Not to some people.

34:18.366 --> 34:20.018
Mr. Monk.

34:21.702 --> 34:23.880
What are you doing here?

34:23.916 --> 34:25.668
We're lost.

34:25.703 --> 34:29.780
We were looking for
the... Ping-Pong table...

34:29.815 --> 34:32.228
and for the Ping-Pong... room.

34:32.264 --> 34:34.668
Uh, just... It's funny.
I've been here a week, and I still, uh...

34:34.703 --> 34:36.732
I still can't find my way around.

34:36.766 --> 34:39.553
But we're gonna find it.
It's probably downstai...

34:39.588 --> 34:40.678
I told you downstairs.

34:40.713 --> 34:43.728
You gotta argue about every little thing.
We're gonna find it. It's gonna be...

34:43.764 --> 34:45.887
- Yeah.
- We got it. It's...

34:45.922 --> 34:47.440
Hasta luego.

34:55.065 --> 34:56.971
The maids'locker room.
Right down here.

34:57.005 --> 35:00.088
God, you're good! It took me
six months to find this place.

35:00.123 --> 35:03.171
Hey, Landis says you've
gotta check out by 4:00 p. m.

35:03.206 --> 35:04.462
No extension.

35:04.497 --> 35:06.256
4:00 p. m. That only
gives me three hours.

35:06.291 --> 35:07.887
That's all Clint had in Dirty Harry.

35:07.922 --> 35:13.225
Hey, uh, Rita, you have had
nonfictional police experiences, right?

35:13.260 --> 35:15.153
Yeah, sure.

35:17.685 --> 35:19.393
Hola, ladies.

35:19.428 --> 35:21.395
There's the locker.

35:25.063 --> 35:27.098
What'd you do
with her clothes?

35:31.401 --> 35:32.982
It was here.

35:33.017 --> 35:35.247
They must have glued
the tile back on.

35:38.433 --> 35:41.052
Suddenly you don't speak English?

35:41.087 --> 35:42.865
Well, maybe you'll understand this.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.097
The party's over.

35:45.249 --> 35:48.621
La fiesta esta... over.

35:48.656 --> 35:52.547
- We're onto you.
- We know you killed Lupe Olivencia.

35:55.742 --> 35:58.835
You think because
you're rich and white...

35:58.870 --> 36:01.980
you think you can
accuse anybody of anything?

36:02.015 --> 36:05.468
Mrs. Garcia, I'm not
accusing anybody of anything.

36:05.503 --> 36:09.006
I'm accusing you of murder.

36:16.586 --> 36:19.899
I should have known.
Fenimore's room was too clean.

36:19.934 --> 36:22.373
Who else could have
pulled that off in just 15 minutes?

36:22.408 --> 36:24.365
They're the housekeepers from hell.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.642
Wait, wait, wait.
Th-They're stealing cameras?

36:26.677 --> 36:29.968
- No. They're stealing information.
- Confidential financial information.

36:30.003 --> 36:32.654
Who is merging with whom,
who's about to go under.

36:32.689 --> 36:35.645
It's the perfect setup.
We have conferences here all the time...

36:35.680 --> 36:37.980
brokerage firms,
investment companies...

36:38.015 --> 36:40.812
Who's in a better position
to steal information?

36:40.847 --> 36:42.609
Nobody gives the housekeeping
staff a second thought.

36:42.644 --> 36:43.828
They're invisible.

36:43.863 --> 36:46.201
So people hide their wallets.
They hide their jewelry.

36:46.236 --> 36:48.886
No one thinks to hide
their briefcases or their laptops.

36:48.921 --> 36:51.632
The maids were
cleaning up. - Literally.

36:51.667 --> 36:55.930
Hey, maybe we can get the I. R. S.
To nail them for insider trading.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.803
No, I'm guessing
they were too smart for that.

36:57.838 --> 37:01.451
They probably got their friends and
family members to buy the stocks for them.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.249
I don't get it.
Who did they kill?

37:03.284 --> 37:05.773
- The missing maid.
- Maid number five.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.778
Lupe Olivencia.

37:08.778 --> 37:10.351
She probably got greedy.

37:10.386 --> 37:13.937
Or more likely, she grew
a conscience and then wanted out.

37:13.972 --> 37:16.635
Whatever the reason,
they had to get rid ofher.

37:20.841 --> 37:23.504
So then they went to work.

37:23.674 --> 37:27.234
It was the cleanest crime scene
in the history of crime.

37:29.941 --> 37:33.492
- And we can't prove a thing.
- Not without a body.

37:33.527 --> 37:38.864
No body, no case.
But itjust has to be here somewhere.

37:38.899 --> 37:41.531
Benjy, what is it?
I found her again.

37:49.111 --> 37:52.242
Okay, everybody, clear away.
Don't touch a thing.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.292
Okay, partner. We got 'em.

37:54.327 --> 37:57.207
I'm gonna call homicide and
the district attorney's office.

37:57.242 --> 38:01.428
And the coroner's office.
We're gonna need a full forensics team.

38:02.022 --> 38:04.688
How long was that?
Was that the record?

38:05.305 --> 38:06.778
All right!

38:08.321 --> 38:10.285
So it's gotta be in the hotel.

38:15.133 --> 38:17.311
Bronwynn, if we don't find
the corpse in the next 20 minutes,

38:17.346 --> 38:19.117
they get away with murder.

38:39.248 --> 38:40.636
Wait.

39:15.401 --> 39:17.065
There's nothing
I can do about it, Mr. Monk.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.012
We're completely booked.
I'm so sorry.

39:19.047 --> 39:20.086
No, you're not.

39:20.121 --> 39:24.670
Tony, they are stealing insider
information right from under our noses.

39:24.705 --> 39:27.644
We are convinced that
they murdered Lupe Olivencia.

39:27.679 --> 39:29.662
Where's your proof?
Where's the body?

39:29.697 --> 39:33.814
- Okay. We can't find the body...
- Because it doesn't exist.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.760
Now, it's checkout time, Mr. Monk.

39:35.795 --> 39:38.450
You are now officially
trespassing in my hotel.

39:38.485 --> 39:43.865
But the case... - Why don't you just go
home and tell your therapist all about it.

39:43.900 --> 39:46.534
Tony, listen,
I have to talk to you.

39:51.844 --> 39:53.228
Where's your mom?

39:53.263 --> 39:55.687
She's just picking up some pictures.

39:56.014 --> 39:57.644
This place is the pits.

39:57.679 --> 40:01.467
Missing bodies, married men.
And half of these didn't even come out.

40:01.502 --> 40:02.995
Ooh, I like this one.

40:03.030 --> 40:06.068
You can tell it was our first day.
We were smiling.

40:06.277 --> 40:08.880
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

40:11.186 --> 40:13.366
Drive carefully, Mr. Monk.

40:13.401 --> 40:15.161
This isn't over.

40:19.089 --> 40:22.839
I'm gonna mail this in.
I have a couple of comments.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.028
- I guess you're on your own.
- I'm gonna get 'em.

40:29.063 --> 40:31.088
I bet you will.

40:31.123 --> 40:33.389
Have one for the road.

40:42.232 --> 40:45.089
- Benjy, buckle up.
- Okay.

40:48.009 --> 40:50.459
Adrian, just let it go.

40:50.494 --> 40:52.985
You can't win 'em all.
Come on.

40:53.194 --> 40:54.802
Come on.

41:37.155 --> 41:39.026
How can you say when you...

42:40.501 --> 42:42.494
I don't think
I can wait a whole year.

42:42.529 --> 42:45.093
- For what?
- Our next vacation.

42:45.259 --> 42:46.895
You enjoyed that?

42:46.930 --> 42:49.011
I had a great time.

42:49.357 --> 42:52.232
Okay, for your information,
that was not a vacation, Adrian.

42:52.267 --> 42:54.677
A vacation is supposed
to be fun and relaxing.

42:54.712 --> 42:56.675
That was murder camp.

42:56.843 --> 43:01.219
I was thinking, the first week of November,
there's this place in Monterey.

43:01.254 --> 43:04.075
No. No, forget it.
No more vacations.

43:04.110 --> 43:08.468
The next time you try to make me
take a vacation, I swear I'm quitting.

43:10.387 --> 43:12.299
I can't believe I just said that.

43:12.334 --> 43:15.186
- You seem upset.
- I am upset!

43:15.221 --> 43:16.923
- You know what you need?
- Shut up.

43:16.958 --> 43:18.998
- Vacation!
- Shut up!
