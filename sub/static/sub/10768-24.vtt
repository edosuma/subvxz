15:26.040 --> 15:27.800
I don't want this to end.

15:27.980 --> 15:30.100

Come on, Carlton, all these years, man,
haven't you caught on?

16:27.170 --> 16:30.830
I mean, half the battle
is the lyrics you toss at the honeys.

16:31.010 --> 16:35.310
Girl, you look good, I wish I could
plant you and grow a whole field of y'all.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.010

17:13.680 --> 17:17.210
No, it's not.
He had no reason to act like that.

And?

18:27.560 --> 18:31.150
And to let you know that I might
consider letting you be with me.

18:31.330 --> 18:34.160
Is that what passes for a compliment
around here?

18:34.330 --> 18:35.420
- Listen.
- You listen.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.120
If you want a shot with me...

18:37.300 --> 18:41.740
...maybe you should try talking to me
like a human being, okay? Got it?

Does this look like a place to have fun?

19:20.640 --> 19:23.870
I don't think so. Ain't nobody
going to have no fun up in here.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.340
Not me, not you, not her.
