WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:04.805
Sam Hanna.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.607
I'm Byron. Good to meet you.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.509
ERIC:
Kulinda Tactical Security,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.544
a high-end
private security firm.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.313
"Kulinda" actually means
"to protect."

00:12.346 --> 00:13.814
Great working with you, Sam.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.217
Ever think about a career
change, we'd love to have you.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.619
Where's Hetty?
Probably halfway to Fiji by now.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.454
KEANE: You don't remember
the helicopter crash?

00:20.488 --> 00:21.789
I was the only survivor.

00:21.822 --> 00:22.823
I survived,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.292
but you left me to die.

00:24.325 --> 00:28.329
I thought you were... dead.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.234
*

00:43.844 --> 00:45.346
(air brakes hiss)

00:48.316 --> 00:50.518
Hey, best for last,
huh, Jack?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.585
At least you're gonna

00:51.619 --> 00:52.586
miss rush hour.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.156
Yup.
(laughs nervously)

00:55.189 --> 00:56.457
You good, Jack?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.259
Everything okay?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.828
Just ready to hit the road
and make this run.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.830
(clears throat)

01:02.863 --> 01:04.832
You sure everything's okay, man?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.834
No! Aah!
(silenced gunshots)

01:06.867 --> 01:08.269
(horn honks)

01:13.307 --> 01:15.643
You didn't have to shoot them.
Shut up.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.245
If we did it my way,
we wouldn't have...

01:32.626 --> 01:34.595
*

01:56.917 --> 01:59.520
Wouldn't that be easier
in dry dock?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.622
Just re-caulking this porthole.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.890
Mm, right.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.625
'Cause water
on the inside of a boat

02:04.658 --> 02:06.494
is never a good look, is it?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.696
Once I caulk it,
she'll be stronger than new.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.631
Yeah? Then why didn't they use
that caulk in the first place?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.633
That's right, premium caulk
didn't exist in the 1800s,

02:12.666 --> 02:13.901
did it?

02:13.934 --> 02:14.902
Oh.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.170
Look at that!

02:16.204 --> 02:18.506
"Captain Ahab was here." Huh.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.241
Aren't you supposed to be
helping me?

02:20.274 --> 02:22.643
I am. I'm offering guidance,
as well as moral support.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.246
But right now
Eric is summoning us.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.248
(sighs)

02:27.281 --> 02:29.683
All right, cool.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.419
Let me get my bag.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.653
So, look,
I was thinking,

02:32.686 --> 02:34.622
since we're gonna be
living at the beach...

02:34.655 --> 02:36.390
We?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.925
We should seriously consider
getting Jet Skis.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.793
(laughs)
We're not getting Jet Skis.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.828
Why not?

02:40.861 --> 02:44.265
Look, they are crazy fun,
first of all, okay?

02:44.298 --> 02:46.267
I mean, it's like
being on a motorcycle,

02:46.300 --> 02:47.801
but obviously water's
a little softer than cement.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.403
Man, look,
they're loud,

02:49.437 --> 02:51.939
they're crass,
they're a bad investment,

02:51.972 --> 02:54.475
and most of the riders are
irresponsible and reckless.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.411
Oh, clearly you missed
the "crazy fun" part.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.647
We're not getting Jet Skis.
Thank you.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.382
What color you
think you'd want?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.417
I got you pegged
for hot pink.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.586
More like angry red.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.621
So you're open
to the idea.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.994
What do you have for us, Eric?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.996
L.A. Round House Manufacturing
had a robbery last night.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.932
Left three dead bodies,
including one of the suspects.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.801
NELL: Now, the haul
was a shipment

03:20.834 --> 03:22.903
of M27s headed for Pendleton.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.672
If sold, those
weapons would have

03:24.705 --> 03:26.640
a street value of well
over a million dollars.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.676
Or worse, be used for
some kind of an attack.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.544
And do we have any leads?
ERIC: Even better.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.479
We have an I.D.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.014
NELL: Meet small-time
crook Tony Young.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.483
He has a list of

03:35.516 --> 03:37.418
petty crimes, minor felonies.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.852
We're dealing with amateurs?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.321
Stealing an arsenal
of weapons

03:40.354 --> 03:41.722
is way out of
this guy's wheelhouse.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.590
ERIC:
There's more.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.392
I was able to trace
the cargo truck

03:44.425 --> 03:48.762
for three blocks, where
it met up with this SUV.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.270
That's Byron Brown

03:56.304 --> 03:57.771
from the Kulinda agency.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.006
What's he doing?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.541
NELL:
Seems he's helping

04:00.574 --> 04:02.443
steal an arsenal of weapons.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.712
Weren't you working
with him?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.715
I mentored some kids in his
neighborhood youth group.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.783
There's got to be a
reason he's involved.

04:09.817 --> 04:10.884
Maybe he's
working a case.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.020
Last I checked, the Kulinda
group doesn't work cases,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.522
they provide security.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.857
NELL:
We contacted Kulinda.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.492
Byron resigned a week ago.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.761
Maybe this is
his exit strategy.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.764
I don't buy that the guy just
woke up and became a criminal.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.766
He's a good man.
Okay, but we have to

04:25.799 --> 04:28.369
at least consider that maybe
he jumped to the dark side.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.138
Where's he now, Eric?

04:31.171 --> 04:34.908
I lost the Round House truck,
but I was able to track Byron.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.844
Yeah, his SUV is still
parked downtown.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.379
Where are Kensi and Deeks?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.047
Tony Young's last known address
was in Culver City,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.849
so Kensi and Deeks
are on their way there

04:41.882 --> 04:43.351
to see if they can find him.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.521
(tires screech)

04:47.555 --> 04:49.390
(grunts)
(laughs)

04:49.423 --> 04:51.625
See, now, that...

04:51.659 --> 04:53.394
was awesome.
And of all the cars

04:53.427 --> 04:54.695
in the motor pool,
you had to pick this one?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.330
What are you talking about?
The keys were in it.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.532
The universe
wanted us to have it.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.434
You think Mosley's gonna
let me keep it?

05:00.468 --> 05:01.702
Keep it?
It's not practical.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.804
Want to see practical?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.607
Put those on.
Come on, put 'em on.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.609
Show me what you got.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.943
You know what that is?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.845
That is op ready.
Really?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.548
Where am I supposed to keep my
long gun, and a suspect at that?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.417
There's a backseat.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.018
It's kind of
got a backseat.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.388
Listen, if we have a
suspect in the backseat,

05:20.421 --> 05:22.089
they don't deserve
to be comfortable.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.857
You know what?
Forget about it.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.526
My Audi's almost ready anyway.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.094
(scoffs) You know what?
You can keep that Audi.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.129
It's about time I got
my own work whip.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.699
In fact, I'm gonna talk
to Mosley about it tonight

05:31.732 --> 05:34.034
before Hetty shows up and
shuts the whole thing down.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.103
You should be worrying less
about the car and more about

05:36.136 --> 05:37.938
whether she's gonna
let you keep your job.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.508
Yeah, I... I hate that
when you're right.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.878
KENSI:
Address says "550-B."

05:44.912 --> 05:46.647
Ugh. Is there a back house?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.416
Hey, check it.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.884
KENSI:
Ah. Huh.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.653
That looks up to code.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.755
Just a little
duct tape and...

05:54.788 --> 05:56.924
hope.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.595
(knocking)

06:01.629 --> 06:03.997
Why are you knocking on my door
like the police?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.599
Surprise.
NCIS.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.567
Step down, please.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.002
Nice and easy.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.471
We're looking for Tony Young.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.839
He's not here.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.641
You sure about that?

06:13.674 --> 06:16.410
See for yourself.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.911
(grunting)

06:20.047 --> 06:22.550
(coughing)
Yeah, yeah.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.984
(groans)

06:24.017 --> 06:26.520
(clears throat)
Yeah, that's, uh, that's clear.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.522
Where's Tony?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.023
Tony's not here.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.561
And if you see him,
tell him to stay where he is.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.962
Do you know
where we can find him?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.096
If I knew,

06:36.129 --> 06:38.165
then I'd tell him myself.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.868
All right, if you do see him,
tell him we're looking for him.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.971
Just want to ask him
a couple questions.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.072
(clicks tongue)

06:45.105 --> 06:46.640
I mean, it's noon somewhere,
right?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.777
Bottoms up.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.844
Okay.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.045
So what'd you see
in there?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.547
Men's shoes,
second glass of wine,

06:53.581 --> 06:54.982
Need for Speed
paused on the TV.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.651
Okay, so if he's not close by,
he's coming back soon.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.086
I'm betting she's
calling him right now

06:59.119 --> 07:01.188
to tell him
to stay put.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.423
Only one way
to find out.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.194
Stake 'em out in the
world's most awesome car.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.229
But also the most
inconspicuous one.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.900
Well, it is so conspicuous
that it's inconspicuous.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.702
And yes, I was
sensing your sarcasm.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.736
(chuckles)

07:20.207 --> 07:21.675
SAM:
There it is.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.246
You got a big heart,
Sam... (sighs)

07:26.279 --> 07:27.848
but you barely know this guy.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.583
I barely knew you
at one point.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.752
Oh, might I remind you
that you didn't really like me

07:31.785 --> 07:33.086
when we first met?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.923
What makes you think
that's changed any?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.591
I'm just saying,
sometimes you have to

07:37.625 --> 07:40.093
look at the possibilities.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.963
You remember that CIA operative,
Junior Ramirez?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.565
Was a good guy.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.600
He was a better agent,
until we found out he had

07:46.634 --> 07:50.137
13 and a half bodies
buried in his backyard.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.873
You got something you want
to tell me about your yard?

07:54.875 --> 07:57.678
Just wondering if we ever
really know anyone.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.783
Just find it
hard to believe is all.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.121
Spent a lot of time
with that guy.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.957
My radar is rarely off.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.028
Sometimes when people show us
who they really are,

08:15.062 --> 08:16.664
we need to believe 'em.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.099
(scoffs)
I told you that.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.270
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that three guys died

08:23.303 --> 08:26.874
in a robbery that Byron is
somehow connected to.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.743
It's possible he doesn't even
know about those deaths.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.311
Well, maybe.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.848
But if he's still involved
after finding out,

08:34.882 --> 08:37.050
what does that say about him?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.787
Hmm.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.088
Be right back.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.801
There.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.003
Now we can sit back
and see if he leads us

08:56.036 --> 08:57.004
to the stolen weapons.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.707
Heads up. They're coming out.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.080
SAM (over earpiece):
You got to be kidding me.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.719
CALLEN:
What, you know this guy, too?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.188
Only by reputation.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.025
That's Travis Coogan.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.161
He's the reason the Real IRA is
a major terrorist organization.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.798
Real IRA and stolen
arsenal of weapons.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
That's bad
any way you look at it.

09:39.379 --> 09:43.350
(camera clicking)

09:43.383 --> 09:45.919
How does a petty thief go from
sticking up a corner store

09:45.953 --> 09:47.855
to robbing a weapons broker?
I don't know.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.057
Maybe he's taking
night classes.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.058
(camera clicks)

09:51.091 --> 09:52.259
What are you doing?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.927
What, you mean
besides looking good?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.996
Thinking about getting
a man bun. What do you think?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.264
(laughs):
I think you're ridiculous.

09:57.297 --> 10:01.669
You know, as far as Young goes,
even criminals have ambition.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.736
No, Young's not ambitious.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.237
He's a hired gun at most.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.940
But he probably knows
who the mastermind is behind it.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.375
Yeah.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.678
Oh...

10:10.711 --> 10:12.946
Two guesses as to
where she's headed.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.948
Uh, the
Wine in a Box Emporium

10:14.982 --> 10:16.283
or to meet
our boy, Young.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.151
Only one way
to find out.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.720
Don't lose her.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.721
Are you kidding me?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.222
Have you seen
this zero-to-60?

10:22.255 --> 10:23.356
Oh, I'm sorry, no.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.225
My head was too busy
hitting the headrest.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.960
Oh, don't worry,
we'll get you a helmet.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.362
In the meantime...
(engine starts, revs)

10:29.396 --> 10:31.832
hold on, darling.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.166
Hold on!

10:33.200 --> 10:34.668
(tires squeal)
Deeks!

10:36.203 --> 10:37.337
Did you get Byron's location?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.405
I did, indeed.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.975
He and Coogan just arrived
at an event in the 'Bu.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.844
What's the event?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.012
Get this:

10:45.045 --> 10:46.980
it's a charity sports
shooting event

10:47.014 --> 10:50.751
hosted by defense contractors
Livingston-Bradford.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.385
Lot of guns,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.387
lot of VIPs.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.923
That sounds like
a security nightmare.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.858
90% of Livingston-
Bradford's business

10:57.891 --> 10:59.192
is supplying weapons
for governments

10:59.226 --> 11:01.762
and private companies
all across the world.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.264
The other ten percent
is a philanthropy arm

11:04.297 --> 11:05.866
that helps
impoverished countries.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.268
That seems like a conflict
of interests.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.871
Wasn't Livingston-Bradford
caught up in some controversy?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.406
There's no evidence,
but the company

11:13.440 --> 11:15.809
is rumored to be
supplying weapons

11:15.843 --> 11:17.778
to both sides
of the Western Sahara conflict.

11:17.811 --> 11:21.281
William Bradford, of course,
vehemently denies this.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.383
Why stop at a charity event
if you're buying weapons?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.787
He and Byron could be
working together.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.889
They meeting the buyers there?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.123
Perfect place for an exchange.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.425
With all those guns out, you
could hide the stolen weapons

11:32.459 --> 11:33.493
in plain sight.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.862
Yeah, but it's

11:34.895 --> 11:36.930
a legit event.
Why buy stolen guns?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.198
Whether it be
groceries or guns,

11:38.231 --> 11:39.299
everyone's looking
for a bargain.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.101
Stolen or legit,

11:41.134 --> 11:42.302
who cares as long
as they're working?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.437
Search for any connections
between Byron

11:44.471 --> 11:46.306
and the guest list.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.308
So, um...

11:48.341 --> 11:49.877
how you want
to go in?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.711
Senator? Investor?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.182
I'm thinking foreign royalty.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.383
MOSLEY:
How about

11:56.416 --> 11:57.885
NCIS special agents?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.155
How was D.C.?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.323
Wet.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.858
It rained the entire time.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.159
Well, that's how it starts.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.228
The more you go back,
the more you love L.A.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.296
HIDOKO:
I don't know.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.430
I dig weather.
Mm-hmm.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.465
Talk to me in December.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.801
You'll be sending
Christmas pics poolside

12:13.834 --> 12:14.935
to your friends
back home.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.403
We'll see.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.438
I secured an invite
to the charity event

12:18.471 --> 12:21.541
as executive assistant director.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.244
EAD has its privileges.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.247
Livingston-Bradford is providing
personal security teams.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.016
MOSLEY: But I told
them I have my own.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.517
Oh, what a coincidence.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.452
Our schedules
just opened up.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.386
MOSLEY:
Fantastic.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.189
You do know this is
a semi-formal event.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.024
Mm-hmm.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.526
Step up your game.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.966
Huh. It's like a page
out of Hetty's book.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.235
Not even the same library.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.269
Not that it matters.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.204
We might not see Hetty
for a really long time.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.974
What are you talking about?

12:54.007 --> 12:54.975
I found her.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.312
Well, her boat.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.348
Where is that, Hawaii?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.350
Yeah. Hanalei Bay
in Kauai.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.185
I checked the bay
cam's history--

13:05.218 --> 13:07.087
boat's been there
for weeks.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.989
Any sign of Hetty?
ERIC: No.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.958
No sign of her in or out
of the airports.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.525
And now we're sifting
through the island's

13:12.559 --> 13:15.195
social media
and geotagged vacation photos

13:15.228 --> 13:16.563
just to get a glimpse of her.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.067
Think she finally went
on permanent vacay?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.869
I don't think so.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.072
Hetty's taken a lot of
extended trips in the past.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.506
Something about this feels...

13:26.539 --> 13:28.108
Enviable?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.111
Maybe we're having
a hard time accepting it

13:31.144 --> 13:32.179
because we can't imagine
ourselves quitting.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.015
Speak for yourself; I
already quit once this year.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.050
And yet you're back.
Touché.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.418
Keep us posted
on anything, all right?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.586
Yeah.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.860
Well, you two boys
clean up well.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.361
Maybe it's time
to consider desk jobs.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.430
I like it, but I need
a little more room

13:50.463 --> 13:51.865
when I'm busting
bad guys.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.233
(laughs)
You might want
to take a picture.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.335
This is available for
a limited time only.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.304
(gunshots in distance)
Look at this.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.072
Wow.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.640
Guns and alcohol.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.110
What could go wrong?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.412
(gunshots continue)

14:06.679 --> 14:09.849
Executive Assistant Director
Mosley checking in.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.019
Ah.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.852
Right here.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.521
Welcome, Director.
MOSLEY: Thank you.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.989
Please feel free to choose
from our collection.

14:16.023 --> 14:16.789
No need.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.026
I had my own sent over.
Of course.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.394
One moment, please.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.170
Well, hello, beautiful ladies.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.504
I'll have them
sent down for you.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.572
(gunshots continue)

14:32.605 --> 14:34.341
Are those...?
Yes.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.475
But don't those cost...

14:35.508 --> 14:37.344
Yes. Any more
questions?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.611
SASHA:
Set the director up

14:38.645 --> 14:40.113
on the target range.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.514
Please.
Actually,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.083
I prefer a moving target.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.185
Well, I love that.
(laughs)

14:45.218 --> 14:46.253
Charles Livingston.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.587
This is my wife,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.189
Sasha.
Thank you for coming.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.125
Cofounders of the
Livingston-Bradford empire.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.326
Thank you
for having us.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.363
Well, we are going to have
a spectacular firearms display

14:56.396 --> 14:58.231
followed by
a very special dinner.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.434
Oh, nothing works up an appetite
like a day of shooting.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.603
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.338
MAN:
Clear down range.
Fire when ready.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.382
So, the reason for all of this--
this gala--

15:15.415 --> 15:17.717
a special announcement
takes a special event.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.319
Spoiler alert.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.022
Livingston-Bradford
is donating $20 million

15:22.055 --> 15:24.491
to the victims of
the Western Sahara conflict.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.625
MOSLEY:
Wow.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.459
Admirable.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.128
BRADFORD:
Just trying to do our part.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.596
It's a small portion
of our company

15:29.629 --> 15:31.698
that provides water
and fights malaria

15:31.731 --> 15:34.334
in those war-torn regions,
and they really need our help.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.668
CHARLES: And hopefully
we'll put to bed

15:35.702 --> 15:37.737
some very ridiculous rumors.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.639
BRADFORD: Well, if we
stand by and do nothing,

15:39.672 --> 15:40.740
we're part of the problem.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.109
It's my goal to make
Livingston-Bradford

15:42.142 --> 15:43.143
part of the solution.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.245
Which is why
I'm announcing

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
a transition
of the company's focus

15:46.646 --> 15:49.216
out of weapons
and into philanthropy.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.651
A going-away party
for guns.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.386
Oh, I love that.
I might use that in my speech.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.254
SASHA: Enough about
your speech.

15:54.287 --> 15:58.125
I would prefer talking
about this dress.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.292
You look gorgeous.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.693
And your security,
equally amazing.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.162
I love it.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.664
You'll have to forgive
my lovely wife.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.068
Couture and happy hour
are her two favorite pastimes.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.702
(laughs)
Come along, dear.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.076
Well, here's to all of us having
as good a time as Sasha.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.244
Please, if I can

16:17.277 --> 16:18.578
be of any service,
just let me know.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.780
Thank you so much.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.782
(sighs)

16:22.815 --> 16:25.318
Donation a publicity stunt?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.253
Could be.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.655
The Livingstons sit at
the head of the board,

16:28.688 --> 16:30.657
while Bradford is pushing away
from the company

16:30.690 --> 16:32.625
to focus on philanthropy.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.095
But he's still the majority
shareholder.
Yeah.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.429
Most of these guys were
born on third base

16:36.463 --> 16:37.630
and they act like
they hit a triple.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.201
Well, shall we?

16:41.234 --> 16:43.803
Eric, start facial rec'ing
the crowd.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.205
Button cams are online.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.441
I think that's my cue to mingle.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.111
We need to play this smooth.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.479
We need the exchange to
go all the way through

16:52.512 --> 16:54.481
for us to get a conviction.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.483
If Coogan or Byron get spooked,
they could call it off,

16:56.516 --> 16:59.119
we get nothing.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.755
I got eyes on Byron.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.124
I'm-a make contact.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.192
Remember.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.260
Smooth.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.729
I taught you how
to spell "smooth."

17:09.762 --> 17:11.498
Still sounds like it needs
an "E" on the end.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.533
(gunshots continue)

17:21.774 --> 17:23.110
Byron.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.244
Sam.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.678
(chuckles)
Thought that was you.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.380
Hey, how's it going?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.116
Good, man.
You working?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.383
Always. You know me.
Yeah.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
You?
Freelancing.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.354
Picking up some, uh, extra jobs.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.224
Uh, kid's tuition.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.128
Got to do
what you got to do.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.262
Amen to that.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.563
I'm-a go back
to my assignment, man.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.631
I just wanted to catch up
with you

17:44.664 --> 17:45.798
before it got
too late.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.367
We'll connect after?
Sounds good.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.535
All right.
Yeah.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.109
How'd it go?

17:56.143 --> 17:57.277
Weird.

17:58.811 --> 17:59.846
He said all the right things,

17:59.879 --> 18:01.448
but it's almost like
he was worried.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.883
He's not the only one.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.318
I'm starting
to get a bad feeling

18:05.352 --> 18:06.453
about this whole thing.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.167
There's Tony Young.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.435
DEEKS:
Yeah, this should be good.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.804
Whoa, Yvette, what?
Where have you been?

18:24.837 --> 18:25.838
Is that his ear?

18:25.872 --> 18:26.839
TONY: What are
you talking about?

18:26.873 --> 18:27.907
I got to be honest,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.842
this is oddly
entertaining.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.711
Never liked reality shows.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.746
Go get 'em, tiger.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.515
I'll stay here and look awesome.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.749
YVETTE:
You got to go. Got to go.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.650
You got to go.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.785
Federal agents.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.387
Don't-- don't run!

18:40.420 --> 18:41.488
(tires screeching)

18:41.521 --> 18:43.323
I got him!

18:43.356 --> 18:45.558
Hey, dude. You really
think you can outrun

18:45.592 --> 18:47.360
580 horses?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.128
Where we going?
Come on, baby.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.631
No! Hey!

18:53.866 --> 18:55.735
(grunts)

18:55.768 --> 18:58.471
Never would've made
that jump over the Audi.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.773
Just saying.
Yeah, no, that was...

19:00.807 --> 19:02.809
That was well played.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.421
(grunts)
Ouch.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.488
(brakes squeak)

19:17.857 --> 19:19.626
(tires screeching)
KENSI: Well, that
speaks volumes

19:19.659 --> 19:20.460
about your relationship.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.127
Yeah, she looks
like more of a "ride"

19:21.160 --> 19:23.196
than "die" kind of girl, huh?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.464
Where are the rifles, Tony?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.565
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.666
You shot two people,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.768
stole an arsenal of weapons
headed for our troops.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.203
What do you think
he's gonna get for that, Kens?

19:30.237 --> 19:31.738
Oh, I don't know,
maybe life,

19:31.771 --> 19:32.939
and then the chair?
No.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.641
This is Los Angeles.
No one gets the chair.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.310
This is more of a gas and needle
type of town.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.545
You're absolutely right.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.846
Life, and then
the needle.
That's it.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.947
I didn't shoot anybody.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.249
Doesn't matter.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.283
Somebody's gonna have
to pay for those

19:43.316 --> 19:44.784
two dead Round House workers.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.619
Look, I was just
following instructions.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.355
It was supposed to
be a simple job.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.522
Instructions from whom?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.492
Byron Brown.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.762
He showed up, said
the gig paid big money.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.430
It was supposed to be my last
gig before getting out the life.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.399
The good news is,
it was your last gig.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.569
The bad news is "out the life"
means into prison.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.571
Ooh, snap. Point, Kensi.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.772
Look, I was just
supposed to drive.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.241
I mean, we can work
something out.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.742
I never hurt nobody in my life.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.511
Yeah, that's actually
a double negative.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.246
What?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.247
Where did you
drop off the weapons?

20:14.281 --> 20:15.515
And who are you selling 'em to?

20:15.548 --> 20:16.849
Hmm?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.586
They're at a warehouse
on Fourth and Spring.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.289
I'm supposed to meet
the buyer in an hour.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.324
So, we're all good now?

20:24.357 --> 20:25.692
Oh, what?
No, yeah, we're good.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.860
The, uh, the verdict is
still out on you, though.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.229
I'm calling the REACT team
and alert the boys.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.466
This feels more dangerous

20:33.500 --> 20:36.336
than that Molina Cartel raid
in Mexico.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.405
At least they knew how
to handle a weapon.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.874
Hmm, recognize
our gun instructor?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.343
Please keep all weapons

20:43.376 --> 20:44.977
pointed down range
at all times, ma'am.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.747
I'll do my best.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.052
Double pull.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.754
On you.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.022
Odds?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.957
I'm not touching
that one.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.895
(laughter, clapping)

21:06.766 --> 21:08.468
Smart man.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.338
She's probably been
practicing that for days.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.006
I'm sure she has.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.675
Kensi and Deeks
got Tony Young.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.843
The exchange is happening.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.446
They're meeting at a downtown
warehouse with a buyer.

21:20.747 --> 21:24.384
That's about an hour away.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.785
Coogan and Byron
don't have the urgency

21:25.818 --> 21:27.587
of two men that are
about to complete

21:27.620 --> 21:29.822
a million-dollar gun exchange.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.824
Maybe they don't like
getting their hands dirty.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.693
Possible they're
not involved?

21:33.726 --> 21:35.462
Well, we know
for sure Byron is--

21:35.495 --> 21:37.430
just how deep
is the question.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.367
This party gives them
a multiple-witness alibi.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.369
Eric.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.736
Where you at with those I.D.s?

21:43.770 --> 21:45.672
(Scottish accent):
Captain, if I push it

21:45.705 --> 21:47.106
any harder, it's going to blow.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.476
I need more dilithium crystals.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.378
Anyone?

21:51.411 --> 21:52.845
Really? Star Trek? No?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.781
I'm so alone.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.449
Anyway, this event.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.085
It's a who's who
of... who's who. Who?

21:59.118 --> 22:01.521
Politicians to teamsters.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.023
We got George Masterson
of BFI Construction,

22:04.056 --> 22:07.126
Matias Rodriguez,
VP of Certified National Bank,

22:07.159 --> 22:10.363
Gavin Meyers-- he owns an
international shipping company.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.432
Coogan could be trying
to ship out some guns.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.966
Oh, I also got
some more information

22:14.000 --> 22:15.768
on those
Livingston-Bradford rumors.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.136
What, did you find something?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.572
It's more about
what we didn't find.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.508
I know it's a huge corporation,

22:21.541 --> 22:23.876
but there's an unusual number
of defunct companies

22:23.910 --> 22:26.613
and liquidated corporations
on their books.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.616
There are so many dead ends
and missing links,

22:29.649 --> 22:32.385
it feels like someone's working
really hard to hide the truth.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.660
(panting)

22:45.732 --> 22:47.066
Tony.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.669
That's it?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.037
Hey, Felix.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.505
Yeah, that's it.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.774
What are you waiting on?
Let's see it.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.083
All right. I didn't think
you had it in you.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.518
But I'm only
giving you $200K.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.754
And you're lucky
I'm giving you that.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.423
There a problem?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.059
I didn't think so.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.594
Yo.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.928
KENSI:
Federal agents!

23:15.962 --> 23:17.630
DEEKS: Hands up
where I can see 'em! Now!

23:17.664 --> 23:18.798
You little...

23:18.831 --> 23:20.066
Easy, tough guy.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.534
Easy. I said
hands up.

23:21.568 --> 23:25.705
On your knees.
No sudden moves.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.808
What is that?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.543
Is that pleather?
You wearing pleather?

23:30.577 --> 23:31.511
Yeah?

23:31.544 --> 23:34.514
And who do we got here?
Who's the big winner?

23:34.547 --> 23:35.982
(Velcro rips)

23:36.015 --> 23:38.451
Eric, I need everything
on a Felix Swoope.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.786
Stand by.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.556
...15, 16.
Looks like it's all here.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.724
Yeah, it's a lot of heat.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.725
Beale.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.494
All right. Felix Swoope.

23:47.527 --> 23:50.096
Couple of felonies for illegal
firearms but nothing major.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.764
Any connection
to Coogan or Byron?

23:51.798 --> 23:53.633
Mm, nothing I can find.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.201
All right, thanks.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.137
Who you working for, Felix?

23:59.639 --> 24:02.174
You know what this is, Felix?
This is a wonderful opportunity

24:02.208 --> 24:04.677
for you to show us
how smart you really are.

24:04.711 --> 24:08.548
You know who either
one of those guys are?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.150
Yeah.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.852
I know that guy.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.253
His name is "I Want My Lawyer."

24:14.286 --> 24:16.689
And the other guy is
"I Want My Lawyer Now."

24:16.723 --> 24:18.124
(chuckling)

24:18.157 --> 24:19.726
Oh, God.
That's funny.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.027
(laughing):
Look at that,

24:21.060 --> 24:22.862
he's a tough guy
and he's clever,

24:22.895 --> 24:24.997
and he wears pleather--
he's killing it.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.900
So no connections, and all
the weapons are accounted for.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.269
I mean, is it as simple
as Young selling the weapons

24:30.302 --> 24:33.105
to Sam's buddy Byron?
I'd buy that,
except for the fact

24:33.139 --> 24:34.941
that Byron right now
is rubbing elbows

24:34.974 --> 24:36.676
with terrorists
and billion-dollar

24:36.709 --> 24:39.111
defense contractors.
So we're missing something.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.180
Yeah. Free cocktails.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.150
(gunshots)

24:46.052 --> 24:47.520
(gunshot)
(yells)

24:47.554 --> 24:49.188
Hold fire on the range!

24:49.221 --> 24:51.858
You all right?
Hold fire on
the range.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.227
We seriously should
be getting hazard pay.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.730
Can you imagine having
to clean all the firearms

24:57.764 --> 24:59.932
at an event like this?
(chuckles)
To Hetty's standards?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.301
Huh.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.237
(gunshots resume)

25:05.271 --> 25:08.007
Will you be shooting
with us today, sir?

25:08.040 --> 25:11.143
No. But if I was,
how exactly does this work?

25:11.177 --> 25:12.945
You're allowed to use
your personal firearm,

25:12.979 --> 25:15.715
or a Livingston-Bradford-- we'll
be happy to supply one for you.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.018
Mm-hmm. And who supplies
the firearms for this event?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.688
Good question.
Let me see what I can find out.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.661
You're doing
a fabulous job.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.996
Thank you.
Safety first.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.031
Oh.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.308
I'm sorry, I couldn't find
that information.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.280
She's good.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.785
It's a list of all the firearms
available for this event

25:52.819 --> 25:54.253
and their providers.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.156
Browning, Mossberg,
Remington...

25:57.189 --> 25:59.659
Right here.
Not only was Round House robbed,

25:59.692 --> 26:00.993
they're also a provider.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.730
That'd be a hell
of a coincidence.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.168
(line ringing)

26:09.201 --> 26:10.336
(phone ringing)

26:10.369 --> 26:11.704
Sam, what's up?

26:11.738 --> 26:12.739
What's the status

26:12.772 --> 26:13.973
on those stolen weapons?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.842
All present
and accounted for.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.910
Any clues off the truck?

26:19.946 --> 26:21.648
Let me call you back.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.749
All right.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.983
Where's the truck?

26:25.818 --> 26:27.887
You think he dumped it?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.856
KENSI:
I mean,

26:29.889 --> 26:31.724
why keep the weapons
but not the truck?

26:31.758 --> 26:34.126
Well, maybe he has some sort
of LoJack system on it.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.928
Okay, but so could
the cases of weapons.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.063
That's true.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.165
You know what I do
when I don't know?

26:39.198 --> 26:40.967
You ask.
I ask.

26:41.000 --> 26:41.901
Hey, Tony?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.203
You holding out on us?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.238
I handed you the
buyer and the cash.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.007
Oh, that was
so nice of you.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.009
Where's the Round House
cargo truck?

26:50.042 --> 26:52.879
Huh?
DEEKS:
"Huh?" See,

26:52.912 --> 26:54.914
"huh" is what happens
while your brain stalls for time

26:54.947 --> 26:56.115
as you try to formulate a lie.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.651
For most people, this happens
in a fraction of a second,

26:58.685 --> 27:00.286
but you seem to be firing
a little slow.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.789
KENSI:
You're not helping
yourself, buddy.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.259
Byron said he
was dumping it.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.830
Uh-huh. And you just, what,
forgot to mention that?

27:10.863 --> 27:11.964
Keeping quiet was
the only reason

27:11.998 --> 27:13.232
for getting to keep
all the money.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.301
And you didn't think that
it was odd that he was

27:15.334 --> 27:16.903
just handing you
weapons to sell?

27:16.936 --> 27:18.037
Yeah, it's odd.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.973
But I figured I was
due for a break.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.308
Mm-hmm.
Oh.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.643
Turns out, uh,
not so much.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.048
SAM:
Talk to me, Kens.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.317
Good call. Byron left
the weapons, took the truck.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.785
Well, that seems elaborate.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.353
He wasn't expecting
to get caught.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.989
All right, Kens,
you guys should get over here.
On our way.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.125
So Byron wasn't
after the weapons,

27:39.158 --> 27:40.860
he was after the truck.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.229
Round House is a sponsor.
Must've needed the camouflage

27:43.262 --> 27:45.364
to sneak something in
or out undetected.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.767
They clean out the mansion
while everyone's shooting guns?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.737
CALLEN:
Maybe. There's a lot
of important people here.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.339
It could be a kidnapping.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.407
That's a big, noisy statement
for any organization.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.810
There's easier ways
to get both done

27:57.844 --> 27:59.078
without so many
guns around.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.280
Any one of the guests
could shoot you.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.317
Which...

28:05.351 --> 28:07.353
would be the perfect setup
for an assassination.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.003
Nobody even thinks twice
about a weapons truck

28:24.036 --> 28:25.738
at a place like this.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.207
No, a truck that big, they
could be smuggling anything.

28:28.240 --> 28:28.707
A bomb.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.009
Chemical weapons.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.243
Who knows?

28:31.277 --> 28:32.411
Before we clear
this party out,

28:32.444 --> 28:34.480
we got to know what
we're dealing with.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.316
Premature alarm, and this thing
could go left real fast.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.351
We need to find out
who the target is.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.120
Or targets.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.989
One thing we do know--

28:43.022 --> 28:44.423
Byron is connected.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.759
He's the answer.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.294
(phone rings)
Excuse me.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.196
One second.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.330
I got him.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.933
See if you can
find that truck.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.471
(gunshots in distance)

29:08.480 --> 29:09.481
(grunts)

29:11.483 --> 29:13.485
I don't have a choice, Sam.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.954
Byron, wait!

29:14.987 --> 29:17.023
(both grunting)

29:19.225 --> 29:20.359
Byron, stop.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.830
(grunting continues)

29:42.114 --> 29:44.150
Byron, listen to me.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.384
Whatever you're into...

29:45.417 --> 29:46.218
(yells)

29:55.461 --> 29:57.196
(exhales)

29:59.866 --> 30:02.501
G, I lost Byron.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.336
I lost him.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.372
(panting)

30:10.176 --> 30:12.178
(gunshots in distance)

30:43.475 --> 30:45.477
(gunshots continue in distance)

30:49.615 --> 30:50.983
(shouts)

30:58.224 --> 31:00.259
Good news is I found the truck
and there's no bomb.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.628
The bad news is we've got
an active shooting scenario.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.631
I took out one, but I'm guessing
we got two snipers on the loose,

31:05.664 --> 31:07.934
possibly dressed
as service staff.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.301
SAM:
G, let's regroup.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.469
Byron's in over his head.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.471
We got to figure this out.

31:12.504 --> 31:13.472
CALLEN:
Sam?

31:13.505 --> 31:15.041
There were three sniper cases,

31:15.074 --> 31:16.575
which means there's
at least two more shooters.

31:16.608 --> 31:17.609
Yeah, Byron's
probably one of 'em.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.646
Yeah, we need to figure out
what their target is.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.448
Byron said he had no choice.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.950
What does that mean?

31:23.983 --> 31:25.284
Means he's leveraged.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.487
Yeah. But what could push a man
to go that far?

31:30.156 --> 31:31.690
Family.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.926
Eric,

31:33.960 --> 31:35.361
have Kensi and Deeks
find Byron's family.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.296
See if they're in
any sort of trouble.
I'm on it.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.564
Let's find those snipers, G.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.567
KENSI:
What's up, Eric?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.003
Callen and Sam need you guys to
check out Byron Brown's house.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.938
They think his family
might be in jeopardy.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.239
Address is sent.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.218
I'm scared, Mommy.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.619
It's okay, baby.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.221
He'll be gone soon.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.123
Uh-huh.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.595
Are we gonna die?
No, baby.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.398
He's not gonna hurt us.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.601
(door creaks)

32:32.384 --> 32:33.319
(gasping)

32:33.352 --> 32:34.186
Federal agent.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.054
I'm a friend of your husband's.
Come on.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.522
Let's get you
and the boys to safety.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.090
Let's go.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.625
DEEKS:
We got 'em.

32:39.658 --> 32:40.726
Byron's family's safe.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.494
(beeping)
Whoa.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.663
What do you got?

32:44.696 --> 32:48.000
I've been chasing down rumors
of Livingston-Bradford

32:48.034 --> 32:50.202
and the Western
Sahara conflict.
Mm-hmm.

32:50.236 --> 32:53.205
There's a long list of defunct
companies that leads nowhere,

32:53.239 --> 32:54.440
except...

32:54.473 --> 32:56.608
for Centerville Technology.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.410
NELL:
Looks like they manufacture

32:58.444 --> 33:00.146
wire cleaning brushes.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.280
Hard to do
when there's

33:01.313 --> 33:03.282
no physical company
at that address.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.017
What's even
more interesting

33:05.051 --> 33:08.320
is the year's worth of shipping
receipts to the Sahara region.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.322
Livingston-Bradford
actually is supplying

33:10.356 --> 33:12.024
the Western Sahara conflict.

33:12.058 --> 33:12.691
Mm-hmm.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.127
Doesn't make sense.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.328
Is Bradford lying?

33:16.362 --> 33:19.665
Why make a huge announcement
and draw attention to yourself?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.333
Unless he didn't know.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.469
It's Bradford's company.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.204
The Livingstons are
major shareholders.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.472
If anything happens
to Bradford,

33:26.505 --> 33:27.773
the Livingstons
would take control.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.141
Bradford said
he's pulling the company out

33:29.175 --> 33:30.576
of the weapons business.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.411
The Livingstons stand
to lose millions,

33:32.444 --> 33:34.446
if not billions.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.083
Bradford's the target.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.084
We'll split up.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.151
I'll get Bradford.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.187
You find Byron and the snipers.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.534
No sign of Byron.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.271
No sign of Bradford either.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.152
Byron, put
down the rifle.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.820
Don't try to stop me.
I don't have a choice.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.688
Your family's safe.
You don't have to do this.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.424
This isn't
a game, Sam.

34:18.457 --> 34:19.625
Byron,

34:19.658 --> 34:21.093
put down the rifle.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.161
Look at me.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.695
Byron. Byron.

34:23.729 --> 34:24.863
Look.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.399
Just look.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.268
I know how much your family
means to you, man.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.270
Just look.
Right here.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.538
See?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.207
(exhales)

34:35.241 --> 34:37.276
Give me the gun, okay?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.810
Give me this.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.347
Sam, I'm sorry. I...
Later.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.282
Right now, we got to find out
where the other shooter is.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.284
I don't know.
I wasn't included on the plan.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.652
I was just insurance. They...

34:46.685 --> 34:48.654
they threatened my family
if I didn't kill him.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.823
There's one more out there
we have to stop.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.126
MAN (over speaker): Please
welcome the Livingston-Bradford

34:54.160 --> 34:56.828
Charity Clay Shooting Event
host,

34:56.862 --> 34:57.796
William Bradford.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.332
SAM: G, do not let Bradford
take the stage.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.168
(gunshots)
(grunts)

35:02.201 --> 35:03.869
(gasping, screaming)

35:04.770 --> 35:07.206
Hillside ridge.
324 yards.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.276
I got him.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.847
Sniper down.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.449
G, on your six!

35:17.483 --> 35:18.617
(screaming)

35:18.650 --> 35:19.751
(gunshots)
(screaming)

35:28.460 --> 35:29.595
William,

35:29.628 --> 35:32.331
they're making
ludicrous accusations.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.732
What's the meaning of this?

35:33.765 --> 35:36.168
We uncovered evidence
of an assassination plot,

35:36.202 --> 35:38.570
and we believe
the Livingstons are behind it.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.640
This is about your company

35:41.673 --> 35:43.709
moving away
from the arms business.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.377
I've been vocal about it
from the beginning.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.213
It's a decision I disagree with,

35:47.246 --> 35:48.847
but it's William's
company-- it's his choice.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.416
I've known Charles
my whole life.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.417
I don't believe it.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.551
CALLEN:
We found the truck.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.286
And the sniper cases.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.288
And we know that
Centerville Technology,

35:56.322 --> 35:57.389
a subsidiary of
Livingston-Bradford,

35:57.423 --> 35:58.257
has been
making shipments

35:58.290 --> 36:00.392
to Western Sahara
for the past year.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.761
Centerville
doesn't even exist.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.397
It's a future endeavor
we're exploring.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.800
Mrs. Livingston?

36:09.835 --> 36:12.338
MOSLEY:
If you know something,

36:12.371 --> 36:13.805
now's the time,
because, eventually,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.674
we're gonna put all the pieces
together.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.276
CHARLES:
Sasha?

36:17.309 --> 36:19.278
What have you done?

36:20.979 --> 36:23.181
He had no right.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.618
We've invested our
lives in this company.

36:26.652 --> 36:27.419
What were you thinking?

36:27.453 --> 36:29.555
I was doing what
needed to be done.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.760
We should have taken over
this company years ago.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.495
Get 'em out of here.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.696
(sirens wailing in distance)

36:46.405 --> 36:48.407
(indistinct police transmission)

36:51.343 --> 36:53.845
I worked for Mrs. Livingston
in Western Sahara.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.847
I should've known
she was up to something

36:55.881 --> 36:59.685
when she was adamant to
learn about my family.

36:59.718 --> 37:03.289
Sam, look, that's my
family, man. I-I...
Hey. Look, look, look, look,

37:03.322 --> 37:05.491
look, I know who you are.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.959
All right?

37:07.993 --> 37:11.530
And I know what it means
to protect your family.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.400
Sam, I-I really don't know
how to thank you, man.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.568
I'm just glad
your family's safe.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.003
That's all that matters.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.972
Thanks for believing in me.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.341
It wasn't hard to do.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.577
We'll talk soon.

37:25.611 --> 37:26.678
All right?

37:28.614 --> 37:30.616
Yeah.

37:31.917 --> 37:32.984
It'll be fine.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.586
I need your hands, sir.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.954
(engine starts)

37:35.987 --> 37:38.824
(indistinct police transmission)

37:39.991 --> 37:42.461
That gives new meaning
to "hostile takeover."

37:42.494 --> 37:45.331
All for the love
of money.
Mm.

37:45.364 --> 37:48.300
You two should go have a drink
at the Soho House, on me.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.868
You have to be a member
to get into the Soho House.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.570
Drop my name.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.872
EAD has its privileges.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.474
(scoffs softly)

37:55.507 --> 37:57.909
I'm going back
to the range, boys.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.647
Hmm.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.915
Well, I got to admit,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.352
you were right about Byron.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.420
Sometimes you got to have faith
in people.

38:08.454 --> 38:12.358
Sometimes you can't be blinded
by what you want to believe.

38:12.391 --> 38:15.361
Takes balance.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.928
Speaking of balance,

38:16.962 --> 38:19.398
it sounds to me like
we're getting those Jet Skis.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.566
How does that even relate?

38:20.599 --> 38:21.800
I'm not really sure
that it does.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.868
Why do I need a Jet Ski?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.503
I have a boat.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.771
Boat?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.439
Full of holes.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.608
Broken-down barnacle barge.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.343
You could tow it with a Jet Ski.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.844
SAM:
We're not getting Jet Skis.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.515
Killing it. Killing it.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.649
Look like Burt Reynolds.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.050
I look good.
(laughs): Oh!

38:39.084 --> 38:40.852
I look good. So what
do you think, huh?

38:40.886 --> 38:42.388
We take my new work whip
up the coast,

38:42.421 --> 38:44.956
grab some beers and cakes
at, uh, Neptune's Net?

38:44.990 --> 38:47.526
(sighs) Only if you promise
not to say "work whip" again.
What do you mean,

38:47.559 --> 38:48.594
work whip?
Mm-hmm.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.396
Are you seriously thinking
of keeping that thing?

38:50.429 --> 38:51.697
Is that a
trick question?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.733
Have you not seen...
The zero-to-60, I know.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.536
Oh, Kens, the Audi will be ready
for pickup in the morning.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.005
Oh, that's perfect, 'cause
that Audi is all you, darling.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.842
Because I am gonna ask Mosley
first thing in the morning...

39:03.875 --> 39:04.710
Ask Mosley what?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.978
That's the person
I was looking for.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.081
Executive Assistant
Director Mosley.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.950
One second, Deeks.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.785
I need you to check
the surveillance cameras

39:13.819 --> 39:15.654
in the motor pool.
Uh, sure. Anything specific?

39:15.687 --> 39:18.490
Well, apparently, someone's been
joyriding in my new Porsche,

39:18.524 --> 39:20.426
and they've managed
to scratch the paint.
What?

39:20.459 --> 39:21.927
Know anything about that?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.094
Huh?

39:23.128 --> 39:25.163
No. What? I was just
thinking to myself

39:25.196 --> 39:26.532
that that was not...

39:26.565 --> 39:27.833
cool to mess with someone's

39:27.866 --> 39:29.968
personal automobile.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.003
Deeks, you were saying?
I was j...

39:32.037 --> 39:33.905
I was just saying I was
gonna ask you where...

39:33.939 --> 39:36.642
you got such a-a
spectacular dress.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.176
My dress?
Yeah.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.578
Really?
Mm-hmm.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.479
You two, with me. Let's go.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.113
Mm-hmm.
(quietly): Hey,
you two, can....

39:42.147 --> 39:44.583
Hold on. Can...
Ooh, son of a...

39:44.616 --> 39:45.984
Okay. All right.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.453
Okay. This is fine.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.520
What are you doing now?

39:48.554 --> 39:50.856
I'm just deleting selfies
of me in her Porsche.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.659
And, also, I'm texting Eric and
Nell to erase all that footage.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.927
Come on. There's no signal.
Oh, come.

39:55.961 --> 39:56.895
I'll buy you your
last meal. Come on.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.897
You gonna say something nice
at my funeral?

39:58.930 --> 40:01.066
All right, they're all deleted.
Wait! What about the cloud?

40:01.099 --> 40:02.601
The cloud.
Stop!
