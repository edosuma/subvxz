00:04.460 --> 00:05.960
Previously...

00:05.960 --> 00:08.080
- Where are you going?
- To see my boyfriend Brady.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.290
- Your what?
- Did you see this cute
necklace he got me?

00:10.290 --> 00:13.250
I just found out KC's at
a truck stop in Knoxville.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.250
Yeah, I'm flying there now
to intercept the dilithium

00:15.250 --> 00:17.330
before she can get it.

00:17.330 --> 00:20.540
Hey, you know where
I can get some dilithium?

00:24.460 --> 00:26.920
I feel like every single mission
I've been going on lately,

00:26.920 --> 00:28.960
somebody's just
one step ahead of me.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.170
What happened
to your face?

00:30.170 --> 00:31.880
Oh, nothing.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.080
I was playing with my cat,
and he scratched me.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.460
I'll pay for this one.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.920
Oh, he'll pay, all right.
He'll definitely pay.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.540
Hey, bro,
I need to talk to you,

00:47.540 --> 00:49.540
and I gotta do it
quick because, well,
he's about to be here.

00:49.540 --> 00:51.540
I figured out who's
sabotaging all my missions.

00:51.540 --> 00:52.750
It's Brady.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.710
Brady's the mastermind?

00:54.710 --> 00:58.580
If he's so smart,
why is he dating Marisa?

00:58.580 --> 01:02.120
She still writes
"left" and "right"
inside her shoes.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.290
Yet she still
puts 'em on wrong.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.540
Poor thing, she doesn't
even know he's just using her

01:08.540 --> 01:10.580
to get to me.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.420
Ooh, I cannot wait to
take down that slimy,
good-for-nothing...

01:13.420 --> 01:16.750
handsome, hilarious man.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.420
That is Brady.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.380
We were just
talking about you, Brady.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.250
Well, I do like
what I'm hearing,

01:22.250 --> 01:24.460
so feel free to keep going.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.830
Well, how about you guys
pick out a movie.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.670
Ooh, maybe we should watch
something fun

01:28.670 --> 01:32.080
where the bad guy gets
thrown in a wood chipper.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.380
I don't care, as long
as there are no subtitles.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.500
If I wanted to read
a movie, I'd get a book.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.380
Ernie, could you help me
with the snacks, please?

01:40.380 --> 01:41.420
Um, but I...

01:44.540 --> 01:46.040
What makes you
think it's him?

01:46.040 --> 01:48.210
I scratched a masked guy
on the last mission.

01:48.210 --> 01:51.790
Brady has the exact same
scratch on the exact same cheek.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.540
I wanna see it.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.380
- Hey, Brady!
- Huh?
- Nothing.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.920
I totally saw it.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.170
I bet Marisa's spilling
everything you tell her.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.880
She's my best friend.
Why would she betray me?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.580
Maybe she's doing it
unwittingly.

02:06.580 --> 02:09.790
Uh, my shoes are on
the wrong feet again.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.080
Yeah, that sounds like her.

02:16.620 --> 02:19.040
Wait a minute,
that necklace he gave her.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.290
I bet you he bugged it.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.670
He's been listening to
all of our conversations.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.460
If he's been listening,

02:25.460 --> 02:28.790
I'll give him
something to listen to.

- Lori?!
- Thank goodness
you're here, Kira.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.620
I really need
to talk to you.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.960
I'm on my way to Ecuador
for a last-minute mission,

03:41.960 --> 03:43.460
and I desperately
need your help.

03:43.460 --> 03:44.920
Honey, call a car service.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.670
You know I don't
drive folks to the airport.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.920
No, my nanny quit
at the last minute,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.500
- and I need someone
to watch Brandon.
- Brandon?

03:55.540 --> 03:57.880
His food, diapers and schedule
are in the diaper bag,

03:57.880 --> 04:00.380
along with his doctor's
phone number and my cell.

04:00.380 --> 04:03.250
Is his nanny in there, too?

04:03.250 --> 04:05.580
I should be back
in a couple of days,
a week at most.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.540
You have no idea
how much this helps me.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.500
- I don't--
- Don't worry,
he's a perfect angel.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.750
- Yeah, but--
- Except for when he has colic.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.000
And by the way,
he has colic. Bye.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.380
( crying )

04:18.380 --> 04:22.420
I know, Brandon,
I feel the same way.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.380
Time to put some bait
on the hook.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.920
Hey, Marisa.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.750
Uh, no offense, KC,

04:52.750 --> 04:56.080
but you look
worse than usual.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.960
I know, I know.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.580
I just... I can't sleep.
I tossed and turned,

04:59.580 --> 05:02.120
I have this mission coming up.
I'm just so nervous.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.580
Wait, you're scared
of a mission?

05:04.580 --> 05:07.000
I mean, I'm not
supposed to talk about this,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.540
but I know
I can trust you.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.000
The Organization developed
this new device

05:14.000 --> 05:16.620
called the Rain Coat,
and it's gonna stop
the Storm Maker.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.620
The Rain Coat?

05:18.620 --> 05:20.500
Who came up with that name?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.710
Okay, who cares
about the name?

05:22.710 --> 05:24.170
I'm just saying,

05:24.170 --> 05:26.290
a rain coast does not stop
the rain from falling.

05:26.290 --> 05:27.580
It just hopefully
keeps you dry.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.750
The name isn't--

05:30.750 --> 05:34.170
How about Project Roof?

05:34.170 --> 05:36.500
Because with a roof,
you are definitely dry.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.420
Unless the roof
has a hole in it.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.670
Okay, Marisa,
just forget about the name.

05:41.790 --> 05:45.790
I'm just scared because
I have to drop off the plans
for the Rain Coat--

05:45.790 --> 05:48.290
Project Roof.

05:48.290 --> 05:49.580
The Rain Coat.

05:51.420 --> 05:55.120
Tonight, in a super scary
alley between 19th and Lincoln.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.500
That's the scariest street
in the scariest part of
all of D.C.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.830
I know, and I have to go
all alone.

06:01.830 --> 06:05.080
I'm just scared that
enemy agents are gonna show up

06:05.080 --> 06:07.500
and steal the plans
and take me out.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.540
- Oh, you mean like on a--
- No, Marisa, not like
on a date.

06:13.170 --> 06:16.120
I don't understand.
Why would the Organization
put you in such danger?

06:16.120 --> 06:17.880
Can't you just
ask for back-up?

06:17.880 --> 06:22.710
I tried, but they
insisted that I go all alone.

06:22.710 --> 06:26.880
All alone to this scary,
scary alley.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.380
AKA 19th and Lincoln.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.380
( baby screaming )

06:39.380 --> 06:41.920
Hey, Judy, how much
do you know about
taking care of a baby?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.710
My brain is an encyclopedia.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.960
I know everything
about taking care of babies.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.170
Proper care,
emergency procedures,

06:48.170 --> 06:50.380
developmental exercises.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.670
Wow, you know more
about babies than I do,

06:52.670 --> 06:54.040
and I had two of 'em.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.750
Since you're
such an expert,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.750
I need you to watch
this baby.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.880
Oh, no. I don't
touch anything

07:01.880 --> 07:03.330
that sits in
its own poop.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.380
( crying continues )

07:05.380 --> 07:07.420
Judy, I have
a last-minute mission.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.790
I'm putting you in charge.

07:08.790 --> 07:10.380
Everything you need
is in his diaper bag.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.920
Is his nanny
in there, too?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.500
Nobody likes
a smart aleck, Judy.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.920
( crying continues )

07:25.790 --> 07:27.830
Two can play
at that game, junior.

07:27.830 --> 07:32.790
Waaaah, waaaah!

07:43.330 --> 07:46.790
Oh, hey, Dad.
what's up, man?
What you doin'?

07:46.790 --> 07:48.380
I had some chicken
that was about to go bad,

07:48.380 --> 07:50.380
so I'm barbecuing it.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
And you wonder why
I'm a vegetarian,

07:53.920 --> 07:55.500
and why no one
comes over for dinner.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.290
I'm trying to
get out the door.

07:58.290 --> 07:59.620
You going somewhere?

07:59.620 --> 08:02.380
Uh, yeah. I was
actually, uh...

08:02.380 --> 08:04.080
going on a date.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.880
( raucous laughter )
What did you...

08:06.880 --> 08:09.120
You're going on
a date?

08:09.120 --> 08:11.880
Did I say date?

08:11.880 --> 08:14.000
I meant that I'm
going to a part-ay.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.790
You're going to
a part-ay?

08:16.790 --> 08:17.830
You?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.670
Yes, actually.

08:19.670 --> 08:20.830
And the party
doesn't start

08:20.830 --> 08:23.670
until your girl KC,
the party girl, arrives.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.880
Okay?

08:28.710 --> 08:31.210
KC Cooper,
you are lying.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.170
You come clean, or those
chickens won't be

08:33.170 --> 08:36.670
the only thing out there
with a burned backside.

08:36.670 --> 08:39.000
Okay, fine. Look...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.040
The truth is,
I found out that
Brady's the one

08:41.040 --> 08:43.250
who's been sabotaging
all my missions,

08:43.250 --> 08:45.330
but I set up a trap
so I can catch him.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.170
Have you forgotten that
not only am I

08:47.170 --> 08:48.920
the senior agent
in this house,

08:48.920 --> 08:50.290
I'm also your father?

08:50.290 --> 08:52.250
You don't hide
things from me.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.380
And we don't hide things
from the Organization.

08:54.380 --> 08:57.460
Well, actually, we do
hide things from
the Organization,

08:57.460 --> 08:59.710
like, a lot of things.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.460
Yeah, we do.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.960
But still, you're not
going anywhere without
back-up from me.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.380
I already got
Ernie for back-up.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.250
Oh, then I'm definitely
coming with you for back-up.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.710
Okay, Miss
Has-Everything-Figured-Out,

09:17.710 --> 09:19.670
Miss Knows-What-To-Do-In-Every
Situation,

09:19.670 --> 09:23.670
Miss Has-All-The-Answers, what
exactly is your little plan?

09:23.670 --> 09:25.880
Well, Brady's gonna
show up to steal plans
for the Rain Coat.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.080
Obviously, he has no idea
it doesn't actually exist.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.080
So I'm gonna leave
the bag with the plans

09:30.080 --> 09:31.960
on the corner,
he's gonna come in,

09:31.960 --> 09:33.460
he's gonna grab it,
and when he does,

09:33.460 --> 09:34.790
I'm gonna come out
of the window above him,

09:34.790 --> 09:36.790
take him out, cuff him,
and bring him back

09:36.790 --> 09:38.040
to the van
while I interrogate him

09:38.040 --> 09:39.540
until he tells me
where the Storm Maker is.

09:39.540 --> 09:42.500
That's your plan, Miss...

09:42.500 --> 09:44.710
That actually sounds
pretty solid.

09:46.290 --> 09:48.960
I don't know why
we needed Dad for that.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.580
For your information,

09:50.580 --> 09:52.710
I just completed
a target shooting class,

09:52.710 --> 09:54.750
- and I came in eighth.
- Out of how many?

09:54.750 --> 09:57.710
Seven.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.620
I accidentally
shot the first guy.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.040
In the foot, he's fine.
Limps a little.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.080
But the point is,
I know how to use
this baby.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.670
Although, on second thought,

10:10.670 --> 10:13.170
maybe a little extra
back-up isn't a bad idea.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.880
( crying )

10:22.920 --> 10:24.960
Who's a cute baby?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.880
Who's a cute baby?

10:29.290 --> 10:32.420
No, seriously, I'm asking,
because it's not you.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.330
( crying continues )

10:34.330 --> 10:36.750
Okay, this one's
always popular.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.540
Who's got your nose?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.920
Who's got your nose?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.750
( crying continues )

10:43.750 --> 10:45.620
Relax, relax,
I don't have your nose.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.500
And now, I don't
have mine.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.540
( sighs )

11:04.040 --> 11:05.500
What is it, Judy?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.000
I'm in the middle of
a dangerous mission.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.210
It's this baby.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.290
- Is he sick?
- No.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.290
- Injured.
- No.

11:14.290 --> 11:16.580
Just annoying.
It won't stop crying.

11:16.580 --> 11:17.960
I've tried everything.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.960
I fed it,
I've changed it,

11:19.960 --> 11:21.620
I've rocked it,
and nothing's working.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.500
You know who is working?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.120
Me!

11:25.120 --> 11:27.500
Just deal with it. I have
to meet my Swedish contact.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.080
Things are very tense here.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.960
Hey, Inga, can you
go a little lower?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.620
Things are very tense
right here.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.080
What's that noise?

11:45.080 --> 11:48.790
Sorry. Taco Tuesday
leads to Windy Wednesday.

11:50.420 --> 11:53.420
Not that. Sounded like
footsteps outside the van.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.040
For a guy who works in
an airtight van,

11:56.040 --> 11:58.040
you really need to
reevaluate your
dietary choices.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.380
- ( clicking sound )
- That's weird.
The doors just locked.

12:03.380 --> 12:05.880
Pull up the cameras
outside the van so we
can see what's going on.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.080
- Ugh, they've
cut our power.
- Alert KC.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.790
Our communications
are down, too.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.880
- I'm going out there.
- No, Dad, wait,
the door might be...

12:20.460 --> 12:22.040
Booby-trapped.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.920
Impressive entrance.

12:45.210 --> 12:46.210
Hand over those plans.

12:46.210 --> 12:48.420
Yeah, how about
I hand over a "no"?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.460
You want it?
Go get it.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.540
Hey, hey, hey.
I just got these kicks, okay?

13:21.540 --> 13:24.710
I don't need your face
leaving scuff marks
all over them, all right?

14:03.330 --> 14:05.380
Thought you can fool me?
Well, you didn't,

14:05.380 --> 14:08.120
because I know
exactly who you are.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.170
You're...

14:10.170 --> 14:14.290
...not who I thought
you were.

14:14.290 --> 14:16.420
Who are you,
and who do you work for?

14:16.420 --> 14:18.380
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

14:18.380 --> 14:20.290
The Alternate.
What's the Alternate?

14:20.290 --> 14:21.960
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.580
Okay, so if I ask you
any question, that's
gonna be your answer?

14:24.580 --> 14:26.210
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.330
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.120
See, this isn't
really going anywhere.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.250
Dad. Ernie.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.380
Somebody.

14:55.210 --> 14:56.380
Marisa?

14:56.380 --> 15:00.330
Please step away
from my best friend

15:00.330 --> 15:02.750
I repeat,
please step away.

15:05.330 --> 15:06.880
I said step away!

15:08.790 --> 15:10.210
Stand down.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.580
Let's move.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.120
Oh, I am so glad
that is over.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.290
For a second, I thought
I was actually gonna

15:24.290 --> 15:26.790
have to shoot somebody.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.210
Marisa, I had to break
this to you,

15:28.210 --> 15:30.290
but you kinda did.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.960
I did, didn't I?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.790
What are you
doing here?

15:33.790 --> 15:35.880
I was worried about you,
so I went into your room

15:35.880 --> 15:37.250
to take your laser lipstick.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.250
Thought I might have
a hard time finding it,

15:39.250 --> 15:41.330
but it turns out
it's literally

15:41.330 --> 15:43.500
the only lipstick you own.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.580
Thank you.
You saved my life.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.420
Marisa!

15:58.620 --> 16:01.210
Stop crying.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.670
There's no reason
for you to cry.

16:04.670 --> 16:08.830
Ewww! You need
your diaper changed again?!

16:08.830 --> 16:11.620
Great. Now there's a reason
for both of us to cry.

16:19.670 --> 16:23.330
Ugh! When did you eat
something green?

16:33.580 --> 16:36.500
How long have you been
saving that up?

16:38.620 --> 16:40.330
They got a fountain
down at the mall

16:40.330 --> 16:43.080
that doesn't shoot
that high.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.670
I don't know whether
to change you,

16:45.670 --> 16:47.250
or throw quarters
in your diaper.

16:53.170 --> 16:56.460
Agent Kira, I'm sorry
to bother you,
but this baby...

16:56.460 --> 16:58.120
- Sick?
- No.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.540
- Injured?
- No.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.620
But no matter what I do,
he won't stop crying.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.420
Judy, I really need you
to figure this out.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.420
It's your responsibility.
My hands are full.

17:07.420 --> 17:10.250
Agent, I'm gonna need
that file now.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.420
Listen, I want you
to take your time.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.580
I am in no rush
to get home.

17:28.330 --> 17:30.540
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.960
Any updates?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.500
Yes, actually.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.330
The Olive Pit has stopped
including sausage

17:36.330 --> 17:38.790
on their meat lover's pizza.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.580
I mean, how ridiculous
is that?

17:40.580 --> 17:42.170
Of all the meat lover's
pizza meat,

17:42.170 --> 17:45.000
sausage is the most beloved.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.540
I was talking about KC.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.380
Oh, no, no, she
wouldn't care about this.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.620
She's a vegetarian.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.960
Marisa, trust me,
nobody cares about this.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.040
Okay, any new information
on the Rain Coat project?

17:58.040 --> 17:59.380
Oh, yes, yes.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.380
First, I have reason
to believe

18:01.380 --> 18:05.120
they are changing
the name to Project Roof.

18:08.460 --> 18:12.120
Oh, and don't be mad,
but I went to protect KC

18:12.120 --> 18:14.330
on her mission, and it's
a really good thing that I did,

18:14.330 --> 18:17.500
because there is a new group
called the Alternate,

18:17.500 --> 18:20.040
and they were there,
and they almost stole the plans.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.000
Wow.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.750
Which is kinda weird,

18:23.750 --> 18:25.710
because how did they know
she was gonna be down there?

18:27.210 --> 18:28.420
I was the only person--

18:28.420 --> 18:29.670
I love you, Marisa!

18:32.580 --> 18:33.830
I'm sorry, what?

18:33.830 --> 18:35.460
I love you.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.120
I know that we're supposed
to be just pretending

18:38.120 --> 18:40.880
to be a couple
for a cover,

18:40.880 --> 18:42.620
but I can't help it.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.080
I've fallen
in love with you.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.920
Really? Are you sure?

18:47.920 --> 18:50.120
Yes.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.620
I love your...

18:52.620 --> 18:54.330
intelligence.

18:56.620 --> 18:59.080
I love how quick...

18:59.080 --> 19:02.830
witted you are.

19:02.830 --> 19:06.620
I love how passionate...

19:06.620 --> 19:10.330
you are about
pizza meats.

19:10.330 --> 19:12.290
I love everything
about you.

19:12.290 --> 19:14.380
I think you are
the most incredible woman

19:14.380 --> 19:16.500
that I've ever met
in my entire life.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.290
Wow.

19:18.290 --> 19:23.790
Brady, no one has ever
said those things to me before.

19:23.790 --> 19:26.460
Sorry, this is
all happening so fast.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.040
So you feel it too?

19:28.040 --> 19:30.540
I mean, yeah, yeah,
I have feelings for you.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.500
I'm sorry, shouldn't we tell
the Organization...

19:33.500 --> 19:36.500
Sh, sh, sh.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.080
Let's not talk
about work right now.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.460
Okay, let's just enjoy
this moment.

19:41.460 --> 19:44.620
( unintelligible )

19:45.710 --> 19:47.420
I'll take that
as a yes.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.830
Don't worry, Dad.
The doctor said
you're gonna be okay.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.460
I know I'll be okay
as soon as we get home.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
Yeah, Dad,
we're already home.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.880
Really? Y'all better
lay me down on the couch.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.540
You're already laying on it.
Okay, you know what, Ernie?

20:18.540 --> 20:19.920
Maybe we should take him
back to that doctor.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.960
KC, stop worrying.
I'll be fine

20:21.960 --> 20:24.670
soon as we get home
and I can lay on the couch.

20:24.670 --> 20:27.380
Hey, we should ask
the Organization

20:27.380 --> 20:30.080
to bring in Brady.
He took the bait just
like you said he would.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.960
Wrong. We can't even prove
that Brady was there tonight.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.960
This is a whole new
spy network.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.920
That's huge.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.540
We can't take them on
by ourselves.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.540
There's only one person
that's close enough to Brady

20:40.540 --> 20:41.670
that can help us
take down the Alternate.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.330
Brady's nana.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.250
What? No. No!
Marisa.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.330
Yeah, that was
my second guess.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.170
Now the success of
this entire mission
depends on Marisa.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.960
I gotta talk to her
and tell her the truth
about Brady.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.540
Would you two relax?
We'll figure all this out

20:58.540 --> 21:00.170
soon as we get home.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.880
Hey, Marisa, I'm
really glad you're here.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.580
- I need to talk to you--
- Me first.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.420
Me first, me first.
Okay.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.620
You're not gonna
believe this,

21:14.620 --> 21:18.120
but Brady told me
he loves me.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.790
Oh. Uh...

21:21.790 --> 21:23.420
He did?

21:23.420 --> 21:25.170
Yes. Yes.

21:25.170 --> 21:26.670
And what did you say?

21:26.670 --> 21:28.790
Well, I told him
I have feelings for him,

21:28.790 --> 21:30.750
but I mean, love?

21:30.750 --> 21:32.580
We haven't even known
each other that long.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.620
Yeah, you don't really
know each other that well.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.540
I know.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.670
Which makes this
even crazier,

21:38.670 --> 21:42.080
because I think
I love him, too.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.290
Yay!

21:44.290 --> 21:45.710
( giggling )

21:45.710 --> 21:48.120
Why aren't you jumping?

21:48.120 --> 21:49.580
Oh, sorry, wasn't I?

21:49.580 --> 21:53.580
I'm in love. Yay!

21:53.580 --> 21:55.710
( weakly )
Yay.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.540
Rob, your name's on TV.
