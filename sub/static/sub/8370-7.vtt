00:58.017 --> 00:59.983
_

01:00.319 --> 01:02.686
_

01:09.412 --> 01:12.079
Lion Guard!
Ono's found dry ground.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.280
We gotta round up
the buffalo

01:13.332 --> 01:15.165
and guide them
over there fast!

01:15.201 --> 01:17.367
Nobody does fast
better than me.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.002
<i>Huwesi!</i>

01:21.290 --> 01:23.207
This way, everybody!
Follow me!

01:26.429 --> 01:29.213
This way! That's it.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.020
Beshte! Bunga!
That last one's yours!

01:37.056 --> 01:38.388
You got it, Kion!

01:42.027 --> 01:44.194
Come on! Let's go, buffalo!

01:44.230 --> 01:46.230
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

01:46.232 --> 01:47.948
Whoa!

01:49.318 --> 01:51.151
Yowch!

01:51.203 --> 01:53.036
Bunga, are you okay?

01:53.072 --> 01:55.205
Something bit me.
And it was him.

01:57.243 --> 02:01.912
We did it, Kion! The buffalo
are all safe and... sound?

02:01.914 --> 02:04.047
<i>Hapana!
Egyptian Cobra!</i>

02:04.083 --> 02:06.166
Whatever you do,
don't let him bite you.

02:06.218 --> 02:07.251
He already did.

02:07.303 --> 02:09.386
Oh, no!

02:09.420 --> 02:12.923
Hey, Ushari?
Why did you do that?

02:12.975 --> 02:15.058
He landed
on my head, Beshte.

02:15.094 --> 02:18.061
He's lucky
I only bit him once!

02:20.266 --> 02:23.100
He's got a point.
Wonder if he left a mark.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.236
Bunga! Bunga!
You don't understand!

02:26.272 --> 02:29.156
That snake,
his bite is venomous.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.407
You mean it did
leave a mark?

02:30.442 --> 02:33.360
I mean,
his bite is poison!

02:34.947 --> 02:36.997
Poison? That's not good.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.284
That's bad. That means...
That means I'm a goner!

02:42.338 --> 02:44.121
The venom's
hit his system!

02:44.123 --> 02:46.123
We need to suck
the poison out!

02:46.125 --> 02:47.374
Okay, if you
think it'll help!

02:49.128 --> 02:50.961
- Really?
- Maybe not.

02:50.963 --> 02:54.214
I have a better idea.
We'll take him to Rafiki.

02:54.266 --> 02:57.184
Ono, have Timon and Pumbaa
meet us at Rafiki's tree.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.102
Affirmative!

02:59.138 --> 03:01.355
Hang in there, Bunga.
Rafiki will know what to do.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.981
Bunga! The bird said a snake
bit ya on the bottom.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.200
Oh! Say it ain't so!

03:13.235 --> 03:16.203
It's so.

03:18.324 --> 03:21.208
Timon, Pumbaa,
calm down.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.910
I'm sure Rafiki...

03:22.962 --> 03:25.329
Rafiki? What's he
gonna do?

03:25.381 --> 03:26.997
Who, me?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.969
Nothing!

03:32.004 --> 03:33.921
Thanks, Rafiki!

03:33.973 --> 03:35.088
That's great.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.090
Uh, nothing?

03:37.142 --> 03:40.344
Rafiki, Bunga was bitten
by a poisonous snake.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.931
You gotta help me.

03:43.983 --> 03:45.399
I can't have
much time left.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.234
I think this is
the end.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.070
Goodbye, everyone.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.990
Hello, Circle of Life.

03:55.411 --> 03:57.327
Bunga! Bunga!

03:59.415 --> 04:02.249
Eh, Bunga?
Honey badgers like you,

04:02.284 --> 04:05.002
you're immune
to snakebites.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.004
What? "Immune"?

04:08.374 --> 04:10.958
What?
I thought I was a goner,

04:11.010 --> 04:12.376
but this is
even worse.

04:12.428 --> 04:14.378
I'm immune!

04:15.931 --> 04:17.047
What's immune?

04:17.099 --> 04:18.214
If you're immune
to something,

04:18.216 --> 04:20.050
it can't hurt you.

04:20.101 --> 04:22.302
So if I'm immune
to snakebites,

04:22.354 --> 04:24.304
they can't hurt me?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.107
Great! Let's go, guys!

04:27.142 --> 04:28.976
Are you kidding me?

04:29.028 --> 04:31.945
We were worried about you
and you were faking it?

04:31.981 --> 04:36.066
Uh, not exactly.
I should bite you myself.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.284
Easy, Fuli.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.037
Bunga, we just thought
you were really hurt.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.071
Me, too.

04:41.123 --> 04:43.373
But he's not.
He's fine.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.292
So let's celebrate!

04:45.327 --> 04:48.996
Yeah! A feast
at Hakuna Matata Falls.

04:49.048 --> 04:50.380
And everyone's invited!

04:50.416 --> 04:52.249
Thanks, Pumbaa.
Sounds great,

04:52.301 --> 04:54.251
but I have to meet
my family for dinner.

04:54.303 --> 04:56.169
Me, too.

04:56.221 --> 04:58.221
Uh, the flock gets jittery when
I don't show up for mealtime.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.423
How 'bout you, Fuli?

04:59.425 --> 05:01.258
Are you meeting
your cheetah family?

05:01.310 --> 05:04.011
Nah. I'll just go hunt
by myself.

05:04.063 --> 05:06.930
By yourself? All alone?

05:06.982 --> 05:09.182
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

05:11.153 --> 05:13.937
Isn't that the saddest thing
you've ever heard?

05:13.989 --> 05:16.106
You're right, Pumbaa.
It is!

05:16.108 --> 05:19.076
Friends don't let
friends eat alone.

05:19.111 --> 05:22.112
It's not like that.
Girl cheetahs hunt alone.

05:22.164 --> 05:23.246
It's what we do.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.366
Not this girl cheetah.
Not today.

05:26.418 --> 05:29.036
You're eating with us,

05:29.088 --> 05:31.371
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

05:31.423 --> 05:33.173
But I...
Ah, ah, ah.

05:33.208 --> 05:37.044
Not another word.
I insist.

05:37.096 --> 05:38.345
After you.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.263
Okay.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.183
Is what Timon said true?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.302
Do friends not let
friends eat alone?

05:45.304 --> 05:47.104
If it is true,

05:47.139 --> 05:49.356
we haven't been
very good friends to Fuli.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.059
We need to be sure Fuli
knows we're here for her.

05:52.111 --> 05:53.310
How do we do that?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.229
From now on, if any of us
sees Fuli all alone,

05:56.281 --> 05:59.116
we'll invite her to join us
in whatever we're doing.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.868
<i>Poa. Good idea, Kion.</i>

06:01.904 --> 06:04.071
Then Fuli will know
we're her friends.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.992
Dinner is served.

06:09.044 --> 06:12.079
Oh, they're slimy,
yet satisfying.

06:12.131 --> 06:13.246
Ugh!

06:13.298 --> 06:17.884
Mmm! The slime helps them
go down smooth!

06:17.920 --> 06:22.339
Uh, thanks, but I'm not really hungry.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.374
Of course. How rude of me.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.176
How can you
dive into a meal

06:26.178 --> 06:28.311
without a little dinner conversation?

06:28.347 --> 06:30.063
Mmm!

06:30.099 --> 06:34.101
So, how are things on
your end of the food chain?

06:34.153 --> 06:37.020
Um... Good?
Good, good.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.240
Oh, wow. You are so soft.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.325
Do you know
how soft you are?

06:42.361 --> 06:46.913
I, uh, don't really love
having my fur touched.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.116
Pumbaa. Feel this fur.

06:49.168 --> 06:51.368
You could drown
in fur like this.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.120
Oh, oh, I wanna feel!

06:53.172 --> 06:54.371
Mmm.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.373
Cuddly! Oh.

06:56.425 --> 07:00.043
Bunga, you try.
Uh, where'd he go?

07:00.095 --> 07:02.212
Oh, I'm sure
he's around somewhere.

07:02.264 --> 07:03.964
Right here! Check it out!

07:04.016 --> 07:05.048
Open wide!

07:05.050 --> 07:06.216
Ah...

07:06.268 --> 07:08.218
Look at me!
I'm immune! Whoo!

07:08.220 --> 07:09.302
Bunga!

07:11.390 --> 07:13.023
What ya doing, Fuli?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.941
Saving your life.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.109
But you heard Rafiki.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.144
I'm immune.

07:17.196 --> 07:18.895
I can't be hurt.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.231
I could've stayed in that
croc's mouth all day.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.899
Gah!

07:22.951 --> 07:25.152
Fine. Go get eaten
if you want to.

07:25.204 --> 07:26.319
I'm out of here.

07:26.371 --> 07:29.206
Bunga! Bubby!
Want some more bugs?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.991
They're delicious.

07:31.043 --> 07:33.243
Are they poisonous?
Of course not!

07:33.295 --> 07:35.078
Where's the fun in that?

07:36.165 --> 07:38.081
Kids.

07:47.142 --> 07:48.225
<i>Hapana!</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:50.260
Fuli's all alone.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.181
Hey, Fuli! Fuli!

07:54.233 --> 07:56.233
Ono! What's up?

07:56.268 --> 07:58.101
Is there trouble?
Trouble?

07:58.403 --> 08:00.937
Oh. Uh, no.

08:00.989 --> 08:03.023
Ono, I was hunting.

08:03.075 --> 08:04.274
Hunting? That's perfect.

08:04.326 --> 08:06.276
I was on my way to hunt
with the other egrets.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.327
You should join us.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.197
Okay. Nothing like
a good hunt.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.203
And this is nothing
like a good hunt.

08:16.255 --> 08:17.871
What? A good hunt?

08:17.923 --> 08:19.206
Yeah, it's great.

08:19.258 --> 08:22.008
Ugh, what are we
doing here, Ono?

08:22.044 --> 08:23.293
Do egrets eat elephants?

08:23.345 --> 08:27.264
No! We eat the bugs kicked up
by the elephants' feet.

08:28.350 --> 08:30.267
Bugs? Again?

08:30.302 --> 08:33.135
What is with
everyone eating bugs?

08:34.940 --> 08:36.222
- Ugh.
- What's wrong, Fuli?

08:36.275 --> 08:37.307
Why'd you stop?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.142
Ono, I'm covered in mud!

08:41.230 --> 08:43.145
Oh, that's not mud.
Come on!

08:43.198 --> 08:45.315
Ugh. Gross.

08:52.374 --> 08:54.991
<i>Fuli!
Jambo!</i>

08:55.043 --> 08:56.960
Beshte?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.880
Hey! I couldn't help but
notice you're all by yourself.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.131
So?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.884
So, I thought you might
want to join me for a swim.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.052
You can meet my
whole hippo pod.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.008
It's okay. I'm not
a real fan of water.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.010
It's not that bad
once you get used to it.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.178
What do you say?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.184
Well, maybe just my paws.

09:21.236 --> 09:23.103
That's the way! Yeah!

09:25.274 --> 09:26.940
Whoa!

09:28.193 --> 09:31.161
Whoops!
Fuli? Fuli?

09:36.201 --> 09:40.170
Okay. So I'm in the water.
Just like a hippo.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.923
Well, uh,
how do you like it?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.040
It's great.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.294
Maybe we can do it again.

09:47.346 --> 09:49.045
Some other time.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.097
Uh, okay, Fuli.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.052
Some other time.

09:56.104 --> 09:58.221
But I gotta tell you,
being immune?

09:58.223 --> 10:01.107
It's un-Bunga-lievable!

10:01.143 --> 10:05.195
Nothing hurts! Not even
bouncing a porcupine on my head.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.897
Wow. I guess
you can do that

10:07.950 --> 10:09.366
with thick skin
like yours.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.368
Pfft! Kion!

10:11.403 --> 10:13.403
Skin has nothing
to do with it.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.071
I'm immune!

10:15.123 --> 10:16.957
98, 99...
There she is!

10:16.992 --> 10:18.074
Ow!

10:18.076 --> 10:19.993
Ah. Sorry, guy.

10:20.045 --> 10:21.211
Fuli!

10:24.249 --> 10:29.052
- Hi, guys.
- Hey! Sorry about the gazelle.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.170
But if you're up
for a hunt,

10:30.222 --> 10:32.255
you could hunt with me
and my family.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.924
Hunting?
With the Royal Family?

10:34.977 --> 10:37.394
<i>Yeah! Thanks, Kion.
Asante!</i>

10:37.429 --> 10:40.096
<i>Hakuna Matata!
You in, Bunga?</i>

10:40.098 --> 10:43.984
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
and enjoy bein' immune.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.402
Okay. See you later.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.021
Bye, Bunga.
Yeah, later.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.239
Now, back to bouncing.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.410
Huh-uh! 99 bounces
is enough for me.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.329
Why don't you go
play in a volcano?

10:57.249 --> 10:58.948
Play in a volcano?

10:59.418 --> 11:02.118
That's a great idea!

11:02.170 --> 11:05.922
No! It's a bad idea!
I was kidding!

11:09.261 --> 11:11.928
Okay Kiara,
you lead the hunt.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.213
You girls ready?

11:13.265 --> 11:15.265
I'm ready if you are, Kiara.
You're our leader.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.052
Can we just get this
over with?

11:19.104 --> 11:21.388
Come on, Zuri. Focus.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.942
Ooh, Kiara's gonna be so impressed
with how I hunt those gazelles.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.143
Uh-huh?

11:27.145 --> 11:29.312
Just wait till she sees
what a tracky tracker

11:29.314 --> 11:31.398
and pouncy pouncer
I can be.

11:31.450 --> 11:34.117
Yeah, that ought to
wow her.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.988
Ooh, Queen Nala's looking.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.407
Act all excited
and hunterish.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.160
Growl!

11:46.465 --> 11:50.383
Ugh. Do I seriously
have to hunt with those two?

11:50.419 --> 11:53.053
Tiifu and Zuri? Sure.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.088
They're my sister's
best friends.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.973
They're like family.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.425
Ladies, follow me.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.158
Who does she think she is?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.360
Hunting right beside
the future queen.

12:17.412 --> 12:21.247
Who cares?
Hunting is so overrated.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.166
Let the cheetah
hunt for us.

12:26.254 --> 12:28.288
Don't cheetahs
like to hunt alone?

12:28.340 --> 12:30.039
Why is Fuli all like,

12:30.092 --> 12:31.091
"Look at me,

12:31.126 --> 12:32.926
"I'm Kiara's new bestie."

12:32.961 --> 12:34.961
I don't even like gazelle.

12:35.013 --> 12:36.096
Hyena food.

12:38.016 --> 12:40.100
Ready?

12:40.135 --> 12:41.184
And stop!

12:44.356 --> 12:46.389
Oof.

12:46.441 --> 12:50.143
Excellent tracking skills,
Kiara! Really fantastic.

12:50.195 --> 12:51.227
Thanks, Mom.

12:51.279 --> 12:53.279
But the gazelle got away!

12:53.315 --> 12:54.397
Of course it did.

12:54.449 --> 12:57.066
We're still training
for Kiara's first hunt.

12:57.119 --> 12:58.368
Come on, girls.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.402
Bye, Fuli!

13:00.906 --> 13:01.988
Hold up.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.323
You mean
I don't get to eat?

13:03.375 --> 13:06.075
What's the point of hunting
if I don't get to eat?

13:06.128 --> 13:08.128
You got to
hang out with us.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.213
Isn't that better than
hunting alone?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.132
When I hunt alone
I get to eat.

13:12.167 --> 13:16.085
Except for today, when someone
in the Guard keeps stopping me!

13:16.087 --> 13:18.087
What's going on with you guys?

13:18.089 --> 13:21.090
We just thought you'd be
happier with company.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.009
Do I look happier?

13:24.346 --> 13:25.979
Not really.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.265
I like being alone, Kion.

13:29.317 --> 13:32.986
I enjoy it.
And you know what?

13:33.021 --> 13:35.939
I've never wanted to be more
alone than I do right now!

13:37.275 --> 13:39.108

Hey, guys,
have you seen Fuli?

17:25.086 --> 17:29.005
Uh, not since I accidentally
knocked her into the lake.

17:29.057 --> 17:31.174
She was kind of
upset after that.

17:31.226 --> 17:34.177
She didn't seem happy
hunting with my flock either.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.063
I asked her to hunt
with my family, too.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.347
But it didn't go so well.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.899
Maybe we shouldn't
have tried

17:39.934 --> 17:41.234
to stop her
from being alone.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.270
Yeah. She said she likes it.

17:44.322 --> 17:45.988
Guess we were being
better friends

17:46.024 --> 17:48.024
when we just let
Fuli be Fuli.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.243
Hey! Let's find Fuli
and tell her

17:50.278 --> 17:52.245
from now on,
we'll leave her alone!

I'm gonna go play in it!

18:13.051 --> 18:16.052
I don't think you get it.
We're going to eat you.

You couldn't eat me if you tried.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.956
Oh. This can't be good.

18:34.289 --> 18:36.906
- You're what?
- Immune.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.126
- What's immune?
- I hope it's not contagious!

18:40.161 --> 18:42.378
Stuff it, fur brains!
It doesn't matter.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.080

- "Fun"?
- Whoa!

18:54.175 --> 18:57.059
Come on, boys!
Follow that rock!

18:57.095 --> 19:00.263
Why do we always
have to work for our food?

19:00.265 --> 19:04.100
Ain't no such thing
as a free meal.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.936
I take it back.
This is even more fun.

19:08.907 --> 19:10.239
Whoa!

19:11.109 --> 19:14.193
Hey, Timon was right.
You really are soft.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.864
- Any sign of Fuli?
- Not yet!

19:20.251 --> 19:22.952
<i>Hapana!
Fuli and Bunga are in trouble!</i>

19:23.004 --> 19:24.170
We have to hurry!

19:31.296 --> 19:33.012
Do you smell
something burning?

19:33.047 --> 19:35.965
- Ow.
- I got it.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.050
- That lava's hot.
- And it hurts!

19:38.102 --> 19:39.936
Calm down. It's gone now.

19:39.971 --> 19:44.106
But... But...
This means I'm not immune!

19:44.943 --> 19:46.142
Whoa!

19:50.198 --> 19:53.149
A little bit further and
they're ours for the eatin'.

- Or fire!
- I believe it.

have done without you.

off me now. We're safe.

21:04.222 --> 21:07.056
Yeah, I know.
You're just so soft.

21:07.108 --> 21:10.359
Whoa!
On the outside, at least.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.062
Hey, anyone else want to
cool off at the watering hole?

21:13.114 --> 21:14.196
- For sure!
- I'm in!

21:14.232 --> 21:16.032
Let's go!

21:16.067 --> 21:20.202
But if you'd rather be alone,
Fuli, that's okay too.

21:20.238 --> 21:23.039
Thanks, Kion.
I do like being alone,

21:23.074 --> 21:24.991
especially when I'm hunting.

21:25.043 --> 21:28.244
But I really like hanging out
with you guys, too.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.329
- You do?
- Well, yeah.

21:30.381 --> 21:33.382
It's like you're my...
my family.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.336
That's a beautiful thing
to say, Fuli.

21:37.388 --> 21:41.541
Uh, you all want
a hug, don't you?

21:42.427 --> 21:45.227
