00:32.799 --> 00:36.007
<i>It all started
27 years ago.</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:37.797
<i>That's an orphanage.</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:41.534
<i>That's me in the basket.
I guess somebody didn't want me.</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:44.099
<i>I hear they did want
the basket back, though.</i>

00:44.177 --> 00:46.145
<i>But it was fine in the orphanage.</i>

00:46.212 --> 00:48.339
<i>That's me in the third row.</i>

00:48.415 --> 00:50.144
<i>I wasn't very popular.</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:52.810
<i>Of course, everybody wanted to be adopted.</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:54.979
<i>Luckily, lots of families came.</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.853
<i>And everybody got to go live with a family.</i>

00:57.924 --> 00:59.824
<i>Oh, except me.</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:02.293
<i>But I tried not to give up hope.</i>

01:02.362 --> 01:04.330
<i>Then, one day,</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:07.594
<i>something magical happened,
just like out of a fairy tale.</i>

01:07.667 --> 01:09.658
<i>Do you remember the one
where the wolf huffed and puffed</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:11.431
<i>and blew the piggies' house down?</i>

01:11.504 --> 01:14.496
<i>And he was wearing a glass slipper,
I think, and he had a pumpkin?</i>

01:14.574 --> 01:16.439
<i>Plus there was that other thing?</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:18.841
<i>Well, the same thing happened to me,</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:21.278
<i>only vastly different.</i>

01:21.347 --> 01:22.780
<i>I changed.</i>

01:22.849 --> 01:26.341
<i>And the next thing you know,
people seemed to like me for once.</i>

01:26.419 --> 01:28.819
<i>And then pictures were taken,
and suddenly I found the family</i>

01:28.888 --> 01:30.480
<i>I always wanted.</i>

01:31.157 --> 01:34.456
<i>Oh, I forgot to tell you, my name is Shelley.</i>

01:34.527 --> 01:36.722
<i>Now I live in the Playboy Mansion.</i>

01:36.796 --> 01:40.960
<i>And this is where I want to live
happily ever after.</i>

01:57.350 --> 02:01.650
- Throw the ball to me, Kim.
- Oh, nice catch. Awesome throw.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.349
- Hey, Lauren.
- Hi, Shelley!

02:06.493 --> 02:07.983
Hi, Hef! Hi, girls!

02:08.061 --> 02:10.256
Hi, Shelley. Looking good.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.431
- Marvin!
- Oh, hey, Shelley.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.866
Thank you.

02:15.935 --> 02:19.564
You guys have to try one of these.
Marvin makes the best margaritas.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.302
That's 'cause they're mangoritas.
I invented them myself.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.708
I added my own little Marvin twist to them.

02:25.778 --> 02:29.077
Well, you're the best twister I know.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.174
No, Shelley, you're the best twister.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.378
- Shelley.
- Hi!

02:33.453 --> 02:36.684
Why are you keeping the rich,
good-looking, famous guys all to yourself?

02:36.756 --> 02:38.917
- You should introduce me.
- Oh, of course.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.018
Guys, this is Cassandra.
She's only been here for a few months,

02:42.095 --> 02:44.529
but everybody loves her,
because she's super-beautiful

02:44.597 --> 02:47.964
and she never throws up on anybody
when she's drunk.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.304
So, Shelley, are you a centerfold?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.568
She wishes.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.203
Yeah, I do. So keep all your fingers crossed.

02:59.279 --> 03:02.544
Hopefully Hef'll give me the good news
this weekend at my birthday party.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.675
I've got my "turn ons" all ready
and everything.

03:05.752 --> 03:10.382
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.458
It says,
"I'm naked in the middle of a magazine.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.226
"Unfold me."

03:17.297 --> 03:20.061
I gotta tell you,
it seems you've got a pretty good life here.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.158
Oh, it's paradise.

03:22.235 --> 03:25.398
We are just one big family. I am so happy.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.835
Why would I wanna live anywhere else?

04:15.855 --> 04:17.822
I love this one. Don't you guys?

04:17.890 --> 04:21.690
We'll put this on the Mansion tab
and have it all sent over this afternoon.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.924
Aren't we just the luckiest girls
in the whole world?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.761
Yes, you are.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.967
Your birthday party on Friday's
gonna be so much fun!

04:30.036 --> 04:31.025
Shelley!

04:31.104 --> 04:34.335
Oh, my God.
I bet you're gonna get Miss November.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.205
Good morning, Shelley.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.404
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.783
Good morning, Marvin.

05:51.818 --> 05:55.151
Good morning, Pooter.
You're looking dapper.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.214
Your blueberry French toast is ready.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.623
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

06:00.693 --> 06:01.921
That's French, right?

06:01.994 --> 06:03.757
Yeah, but more important than the food,

06:03.830 --> 06:06.162
I actually added something
to your orange juice.

06:06.232 --> 06:09.565
Oh, Marvin,
thank you so much for telling me.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.865
Usually I don't find out until much later.

06:11.938 --> 06:15.430
Oh, no. To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vanilla extract,

06:15.508 --> 06:19.535
then, of course, some egg yolks,
and then, I have a secret ingredient.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.172
All right, you twisted my arm,
it's chili powder.

06:22.248 --> 06:27.242
Yeah. It just explodes your taste buds,
so the drink just envelops your mouth.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.947
Oh, I love having my mouth enveloped.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.989
What's that?

06:33.192 --> 06:36.127
Is this from Hef? Is this my birthday gift?

06:36.195 --> 06:39.164
Oh, Pooter, is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.723
That's what I wished for
when I blew out my candle.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.326
Oh, my gosh, I just told you my wish.
Now it won't come true.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.202
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to tell, it just came out.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.332
My teeth couldn't stop it.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.606
I take it all back, I take it all back.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.407
Okay, I'm ready.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.345
"Dear Shelley..." Oh, my gosh, that's me.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.150
Wait, there's more.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.882
"Please move out
of the Mansion immediately."

07:11.664 --> 07:13.029
Move out?

07:17.503 --> 07:21.837
"You have two hours to collect
your belongings and leave the premises.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.700
"All my love, Hef."

07:27.914 --> 07:29.711
Hef's kicking me out?

07:30.683 --> 07:32.708
Why would he do that?

07:32.785 --> 07:35.447
This is my home. This is my family.

07:36.522 --> 07:40.856
I hate to say this, Shelley,
but maybe it's because of your age.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.088
But I'm 27.

07:43.162 --> 07:46.290
Yeah, but that's 59 in Bunny years.

07:47.166 --> 07:51.762
But I just turned 27 last night.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.500
It's almost like I'm still 26.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.734
Or 58.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.741
I've gotta talk to Hef,
maybe he'll let me stay.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.606
Hef!

08:02.081 --> 08:03.275
Hef!

08:03.850 --> 08:04.908
Hef!

08:05.585 --> 08:06.643
Hef!

08:08.921 --> 08:10.411
Where is he?

08:10.490 --> 08:14.927
He left for Vegas, Shelley.
I don't think he's that good with goodbyes.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.823
Why is this all happening?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.533
Where's my pink Prius?

08:23.302 --> 08:28.137
The Prius actually belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.472
But...

08:36.515 --> 08:38.039
Come on, Pooter.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.517
We have to go find a new place to live.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.053
Come on, now.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.145
Come here, Pooter.

08:44.222 --> 08:47.283
Here, let me help, Shelley. Hey, Pooter.
Shelley's calling you now.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.193
Come on, Pooter.
Go with Shelley, buddy. Pooter!

08:50.263 --> 08:53.096
That hurts! Go with Shelley, Pooter!

08:55.635 --> 08:56.932
Damn it!

09:02.875 --> 09:06.606
Why don't I just keep him here
for a little while, until he calms down?

09:06.679 --> 09:08.203
Okay.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.010
Well, don't worry, Pooter.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.949
I'm gonna find us a really nice place to live,

09:13.019 --> 09:15.180
and then maybe you'll wanna
come live with me.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.653
I'm sure he will.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.282
Well, you take care, Shelley.

09:30.870 --> 09:31.962
Bye.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.139
I know it's an embarrassment
to live in a beat-up car,

09:44.216 --> 09:45.911
but don't lose faith, Pooter.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.509
I'm gonna get a great job soon,

09:47.587 --> 09:51.216
and find us a super place to live,
with a new family.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.281
I pinkie promise, Pooter.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.833
Good evening, ma'am.

10:06.706 --> 10:10.073
You violated Code 753.
That's unlawful spitting.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.673
I was just brushing my teeth.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.145
You currently residing in this car, ma'am?

10:15.214 --> 10:17.478
I'm gonna have to issue another ticket.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.213
Would you maybe stop giving me tickets
if I told you I was having a really bad week

10:21.287 --> 10:23.881
because I used to be a Playboy Bunny,
but I got kicked out of the Mansion

10:23.956 --> 10:26.254
because I'm 59 years old?

10:27.426 --> 10:32.159
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out
of the car and take a Breathalyzer.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.323
Okay.

10:37.837 --> 10:38.861
Noises.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.668
I'm gonna need you to blow on this.

10:41.741 --> 10:42.901
Really?

10:44.443 --> 10:46.502
I guess.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.047
You tried to do what?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.382
To a cop?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.590
Stupid!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.752
I was just doing what he said.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.590
He was in a uniform and everything.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.496
Don't worry, sweetie.
First-timers only get one night.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.863
You'll be back on the street selling
in no time.

11:08.934 --> 11:12.461
But I'm not a prostitute.
I was just brushing my teeth.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.240
I like your tights.

11:20.813 --> 11:25.409
And, you know,
you should really go for a more natural look.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.453
All that heavy makeup
just hides your beauty.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.287
I'm a dude.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.685
Oh, well, you're good like that.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.994
So, did you hear
about the pool party at Jordan's?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.699
It was unbelievable.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.105
- Oh, last Saturday?
- Yes.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.338
- Oh, my God. He makes the best margaritas.
- Yep. It's because he uses mangos.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.642
- No. Really?
- He read about them somewhere.

12:28.714 --> 12:29.772
Yeah, mangoritas.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.714
- Jordan's just so hot.
- I know.

12:31.784 --> 12:32.842
So are all his friends.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.443
Yeah, seriously,
I've tried to hook up with all of them.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.149
- No, you have not.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.815
Two of them, I succeeded.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.884
- Really?
- It was amazing.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.395
Who knew?

12:44.463 --> 12:46.522
I was so excited.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.963
Looks like a mini-Playboy Mansion.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.017
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:14.894 --> 13:15.918
Hi.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.487
Can I help you?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.565
Yes. I would like to live here, please.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.536
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to live here.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.937
- Do you go to this school?
- This is a school?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.672
Where are the desks?

13:32.511 --> 13:36.242
No. This is a sorority house at a school.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.375
And you do look like an older,

13:39.451 --> 13:42.352
sluttier version of the type of girl
we would want.

13:42.421 --> 13:46.255
But, I'm sorry, you're not a student.
It was so nice talking to you.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.850
- But I really think it's...
- So nice.

13:51.964 --> 13:56.094
And our piano is from Tuscany.
Very high-end.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.103
I believe that every detail of the house

13:59.171 --> 14:01.901
should be a reflection
of the girls who live here.

14:01.974 --> 14:05.239
Hi. Do you ladies go to school here, too?

14:05.311 --> 14:06.938
Not anymore.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.638
We're the housemothers
of the sororities on campus.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.183
That's so dope.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.811
Do you live in the houses with the girls?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.184
Yes.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.223
That's even dopier.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.653
So, what do housemothers do?

14:20.726 --> 14:22.284
We oversee the meal plans,

14:22.361 --> 14:25.819
chaperone the social events,
make sure the girls stay out of trouble.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.493
Oh, my gosh. That's exactly
what I used to do back at the Mansion.

14:29.568 --> 14:30.967
Can I be one, too?

14:31.036 --> 14:35.132
I'm sorry. This is a sorority, not a brothel.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.040
A brothel?
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.975
I'm looking to be like you.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.070
I wanna be a housemother.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.345
We have standards.

14:44.416 --> 14:48.819
Standards that you clearly do not meet.
But it was nice to meet you.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.345
But I just want to...

14:50.422 --> 14:51.548
- So nice.
- So nice.

15:00.966 --> 15:05.027
Try Zeta. Their last housemother was
hospitalized with hallucinations.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.401
Awesome.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.405
Awesome.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.417
Hello?

15:32.298 --> 15:36.462
Dean Simmons. Please, please.
We are trying so hard. I promise you.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.197
This seems really unfair.
And I'm not gonna attack you.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.035
I don't want you to feel attacked by all of us,
so I'm just gonna say "me."

15:42.107 --> 15:44.803
To me, this feels really unfair.

15:44.877 --> 15:48.335
Natalie. Look, I feel the same way you do.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.540
But the fact remains,

15:49.615 --> 15:53.244
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now.

15:53.319 --> 15:56.379
And I'm under a lot of pressure
from other sororities

15:56.488 --> 15:58.649
complaining that we're bending
the rules for you.

15:58.724 --> 16:02.091
By "other sororities,"
do you happen to mean Phi lota Mu?

16:02.161 --> 16:05.324
I really don't think
it matters who complained.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.264
Natalie, rules are rules.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.662
Drama queen.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.367
Oh, I'm sorry I scared you.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.843
Do you think you could help me
out of here, though?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.436
What? Yeah.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.405
Thanks.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.677
I'm so sorry, I think I broke your Z.

16:25.751 --> 16:29.551
Oh. No, it's okay.
It falls off, like, every time we open the door.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.283
Well, at least you still have T and A.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.918
T and an A. Who are you?

16:38.364 --> 16:41.856
My name is Shelley,
and I'm here to be your housemother.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.938
Well, it's nice to meet you, Shelley.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.941
But, unfortunately, he...

16:51.977 --> 16:53.774
It's a little too late.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.509
We're about to lose our charter,
so if we don't have a house,

16:57.583 --> 16:59.744
we won't really be needing a housemother.

17:00.652 --> 17:03.678
Well, why are they gonna
take your house away?

17:04.890 --> 17:09.987
Because we get no pledges,
and everyone kind of thinks we're losers.

17:10.462 --> 17:14.489
That's so sad.
Why does everyone else get all the pledges?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.296
Well, they have great parties, and

17:17.803 --> 17:20.532
boys actually like them.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.775
I'm an expert at parties and boys.
I'm a Bunny.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.310
Men write to me from prison,
sometimes in their own blood.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.244
I mean, I assume it's theirs, who knows?
I don't.

17:29.314 --> 17:30.440
I'm sorry, I'm nervous right now,

17:30.516 --> 17:33.280
because I really wanna help you guys,
because I know I can do it.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.445
Wow, a Bunny?

17:35.821 --> 17:37.686
Like a centerfold?

17:37.756 --> 17:42.819
Oh, bless your heart, no.
Just a couple of small pictorials,

17:42.895 --> 17:47.161
"Girls of the Midwest," "Girls with GEDs,"
"Girls of Charlie Sheen."

17:48.033 --> 17:50.297
But now I'm a homeless person.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.200
God, I'm so sorry.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.032
Good luck.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.735
Wait, but I can really help you guys.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.679
So if we don't get pledges,
we lose our charter?

18:01.747 --> 18:04.841
- We need 30.
- Thirty pledges? There's seven of us, dude.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.317
<i>Technically, 71l2 now.</i>

18:07.386 --> 18:08.512
Hey!

18:08.587 --> 18:11.920
Oh, nothing a little fertilizer can't help.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.625
Not you, Tanya.
I was talking about Harmony.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.789
Actually, 7 3/4 as of Tuesday last week.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.625
Guys, we're never gonna get
that many pledges.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.864
This is just their way of shutting us down.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.406
This is awful.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.499
Hey, Joanne, just FYI,

18:30.576 --> 18:33.739
you've got refrigerator magnets
stuck to your brace again.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.143
Actually, we need that.
That's our grocery list.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.341
I knew that. I knew that.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.714
- No, you didn't.
- Did so.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.982
- Why do we need knee-highs?
- Oh, my God.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.318
Oh, my God. There's boys on our lawn.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.320
Are they lost?

18:51.396 --> 18:52.488
Nice.

18:53.232 --> 18:56.565
The Leaning Panther. I like that. Yoga's hot.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.699
So, are you a Zeta?

19:00.272 --> 19:02.240
Oh, I wish.

19:03.075 --> 19:08.138
Yeah, I do, too, because
Zeta would be my new favorite hizzety-hang.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.111
Well, she is not a Zeta,

19:11.950 --> 19:14.817
because she's our new
hizzety-housemother.

19:15.754 --> 19:18.120
She'll be hizzy-tizzies...

19:18.190 --> 19:20.385
She'll be here all the time.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.955
You're hiring me?

19:23.462 --> 19:25.453
Oh, give me some of that.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.194
Oh, God bless her.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.562
- Why are they acting like that?
- Yes.

19:32.538 --> 19:36.235
Oh, that's boys just being boys.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.500
Thank goodness.

19:43.982 --> 19:48.385
Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy
that you guys want me here.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.444
You are not gonna be sorry.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.922
So this is how we're gonna get pledges?

19:52.991 --> 19:57.189
Hiring an archaically superficial reflection
of the male fantasy?

19:57.262 --> 19:59.492
Well, guys like her.

19:59.598 --> 20:04.535
And since guys don't like us,
I figured she could help.

20:04.603 --> 20:09.631
So, in order to be in a sisterhood,
now we have to be popular?

20:09.708 --> 20:14.338
No, no. In order to keep our house,
though, we do have to be popular. Yes.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.609
So, I figured Shelley here could
teach us how.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.709
Okay, look, don't get me wrong. I love guys.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.652
But I lived in a house filled with girls
for nine years,

20:23.722 --> 20:28.625
and I know that there's nothing better
than just being with your sisters,

20:28.694 --> 20:33.063
sharing, talking all night,
painting each other's bodies,

20:33.865 --> 20:37.323
baking penis cookies,
playing with monkeys...

20:38.103 --> 20:40.936
- Where'd you live?
- The Playboy Mansion.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.773
No, that doesn't make her a hooker. Sorry.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.214
She's shy. She's just...

20:58.423 --> 21:02.257
She's so shy. That's Lilly, also, by the way.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.487
Lilly.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.964
And this here is Harmony.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.330
Harmony.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.432
And Carrie Mae.

21:14.506 --> 21:15.973
Carrie Mae.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.805
And then Joanne, over there.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.208
Joanne.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.971
Wow, you hired the Exorcist. That's great.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.642
What is that?

21:26.718 --> 21:29.186
Is that like a Yoda thing, or what?

21:29.788 --> 21:31.813
It's fun, but, what...

21:31.890 --> 21:36.350
Oh, no, no. It's just this thing I do
to remember people's names.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.452
Natalie.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.556
So, thank you guys so much
for letting me be your housemother.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.232
No, it's no problem.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.801
Because you just...

21:48.573 --> 21:50.370
This is just gonna be great.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.534
But I have to go take a shower,

21:51.610 --> 21:54.875
because I haven't had one since
I slept in my car and spent the night in jail.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.106
Sweet.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.749
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, my God!

22:00.819 --> 22:03.049
Shelley! Hi. Where's your robe?

22:03.121 --> 22:04.782
Oh, I just like to air dry.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.017
Oh, she just likes to air dry.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.026
My God, you're so vapid.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.891
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.863
You're like the hundredth person
who's told me that.

22:13.932 --> 22:18.164
Shell? Just a quick little side note,

22:18.236 --> 22:19.669
I don't think that some
of the girls in this house

22:19.738 --> 22:21.638
have even seen their own bodies naked,

22:21.707 --> 22:26.076
so they probably don't really want
to see your perfectly engineered boobs.

22:26.144 --> 22:30.843
Well, I'm just walking around
in the body God and Dr. Borkman gave me.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.979
Hey, Shelley, why don't you throw
some clothes on?

22:37.055 --> 22:39.387
We've got a lot of work to do.

22:40.125 --> 22:43.253
This year, we are gonna get
lots and lots of pledges.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.590
Okay.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.064
Oh, we also need to raise money
for our philanthropy.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.033
What's a phila-canopee?

22:50.702 --> 22:53.796
Oh, no. It's a philanthropy.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.598
It's like a charity.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.302
Oh, I love charity.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.366
One time, at the Mansion,

22:59.444 --> 23:03.005
I even let Bob Saget grind on me
during a slow dance.

23:06.151 --> 23:08.642
And here's a list of ideas
I came up with for fundraisers

23:08.720 --> 23:10.984
that might make us a little more popular.

23:11.056 --> 23:15.254
So, please take a read.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.557
"Start a beekeeping club."

23:17.629 --> 23:19.859
We could have the masks, even.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.265
"Paleolithic bake sale."

23:24.369 --> 23:27.805
<i>Hi! Dinosaurs!
Like, everyone saw Jurassic Park.</i>

23:29.441 --> 23:31.238
"B.Y.O.M."

23:31.309 --> 23:32.537
Bring your own man?

23:32.611 --> 23:35.136
No. Bring your own mouse!

23:36.047 --> 23:37.241
Which is better.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.806
Because they're cute and they're little
and you can hold them.

23:39.885 --> 23:44.549
And also, another thing that
I thought of was, you could dress them up.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.524
It's the whole fun part of it,
is you can put them in little outfits.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.026
You can make, like,
an Abraham Lincoln mouse.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.290
And you could do like Joan of...

23:52.364 --> 23:55.629
Why do everyone's eyes glaze over
when I talk about this?

23:55.700 --> 23:57.327
Whoa. No.

23:57.402 --> 24:00.929
No, they weren't glazing.
They were just taking a break.

24:01.673 --> 24:04.733
Natalie, these are super, super-great ideas.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.278
Thank you. I worked really hard.

24:07.345 --> 24:10.746
But we might wanna try
something a little more

24:11.249 --> 24:12.307
sexy.

24:13.852 --> 24:17.447
Car wash. Come get your car washed.

24:18.023 --> 24:21.151
Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.

24:21.226 --> 24:24.195
I have a car, and I'm great at washing it.

24:25.697 --> 24:27.790
I am so offended right now.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.391
Come on, guys, let's give her a chance.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.835
- Car wash.
- Car wash!

24:32.904 --> 24:34.997
You said you needed to raise money.

24:35.073 --> 24:40.340
Well, washing cars is a fun and sexy way
to make all the money that we need.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.809
So, car wash!

24:44.683 --> 24:46.082
Car wash.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.178
We're having a car wash.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.516
Car wash.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.819
No, I can't bend that way.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.792
Hey, watch this, guys.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.826
Hi, guys.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.095
Dude, that's wild.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.433
Oh, my God. Shelley, that's Colby.
I'm in love with him.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.271
Oh, that's so sweet.
How long have you guys been going out?

25:11.042 --> 25:14.876
No. We are not going out.
I've never even talked to him.

25:15.747 --> 25:17.544
And he's coming this way. What do I do?

25:17.616 --> 25:18.878
Do sexy.

25:20.252 --> 25:24.052
Wash these cars, you sexy bitches!

25:24.122 --> 25:26.852
They are filthy. And so are you!

25:27.659 --> 25:29.650
Did she just call us bitches?

25:29.728 --> 25:31.525
Did she just call us sexy?

25:31.596 --> 25:33.894
Wash! Wash! Wash!

25:33.965 --> 25:37.059
Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!

25:39.771 --> 25:41.363
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.335
Okay, that's the first time
we've ever spoken, so... First time.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.502
Hi!

25:47.145 --> 25:51.081
We're just washing cars and being sexy.

25:51.149 --> 25:52.138
Mostly sexy.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.209
So, does anybody want a wet T-shirt?

25:56.154 --> 25:59.715
- Yeah.
- Or, you know, maybe some wet pants.

26:04.496 --> 26:07.624
Someone went accident in her sexy pants.

26:07.699 --> 26:11.294
So, anyway, we're having some drinks
over at Theta later.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.269
- Theta.
- Totally.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.397
You wanna come over?

26:15.473 --> 26:16.633
Yes.

26:17.142 --> 26:20.407
Well, we are a little thirsty.

26:20.478 --> 26:22.810
Maybe you guys are, too.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.975
Why don't you have a drink right now?

26:26.051 --> 26:28.144
I'll take a little sip.

26:32.891 --> 26:34.415
I am so sorry.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.121
Thought I'd help you wash the testosterone
off your face, Colby.

26:39.197 --> 26:40.721
Well, cool.

26:40.799 --> 26:44.667
So, what time can we drop by for drinks?

26:46.071 --> 26:48.039
Now that you mention it,

26:48.740 --> 26:50.435
the guest list is looking pretty full.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.942
So, maybe next time, all right?

26:53.011 --> 26:54.569
Hey, Super-brace!

26:54.646 --> 26:57.444
Oil can. Oil can.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.882
Not cool, man. Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.822
Well, I think we're done here, sexy bitches.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.948
Thanks a lot, Mona.

27:07.025 --> 27:09.653
The one chance I get to talk to Colby,
and you completely ruin it.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.389
Yeah, because the whole
peeing-in-your-pants thing

27:11.463 --> 27:13.124
was really working out well for you.

27:13.198 --> 27:14.631
Thank you.

27:14.699 --> 27:18.294
My car's still dirty,
so I'll be out here if you need me.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.398
Do you want a car wash?

27:25.176 --> 27:26.473
Me?

27:26.544 --> 27:29.138
Oh, no. No. I have a bike.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.409
Besides, I gotta get back to work.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.849
Oh, yeah. I know all about work.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.786
I'm at work right now, actually.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.016
Oh, do you wash cars?

27:39.124 --> 27:41.752
No. I'm the Zeta Sorority Housemother.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.056
You seem a little young
to be a housemother.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.358
Really?

27:47.265 --> 27:49.426
You think I'm young?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.594
Oh, thank you.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.194
Thank you.

27:53.271 --> 27:56.968
I'm sorry to invade your space,
but I needed that.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.905
So, what's your job?

28:00.979 --> 28:03.004
Oh... Job.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.875
I manage a nursing home.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.947
It's so great you give nurses a place to live.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.887
Actually, it's a nursing home
for senior citizens.

28:16.294 --> 28:19.127
An old folks'... Old people. Old people.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.562
I know lots of old men.

28:21.633 --> 28:25.626
Hairy and not hairy.
But I don't mean to brag.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.102
So, they live there?

28:29.174 --> 28:31.165
Like an orphanage for old people?

28:31.242 --> 28:35.076
Well, yeah. I mean, that's one way
you could look at it. Yeah.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.576
Their parents are gone,
and they live in a big building

28:38.650 --> 28:40.880
all by themselves,
wondering where everybody went,

28:40.952 --> 28:43.079
and I think I'm gonna cry.

28:44.422 --> 28:49.450
Listen, if you want, you know,
you could stop by the nursing home,

28:49.527 --> 28:52.462
because we always need
volunteers to help out

28:52.530 --> 28:54.589
and visit with the old people,

28:54.666 --> 28:56.224
if you're interested.

28:56.301 --> 28:59.202
Yeah. I'd love to.

29:01.239 --> 29:05.175
My name is Shelley.
And I like long walks and hate rude people.

29:06.044 --> 29:09.104
Oh, that's good to know. I'm Oliver.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.478
- Oliver.
- Yes.

29:11.549 --> 29:15.918
I like taking long walks with rude people.
Only on short piers, though.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.217
That's funny.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.193
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.695
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.526
Guys.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.662
Okay, this isn't my fault. Don't like...

29:33.738 --> 29:35.672
I know it was a disaster, but she's...

29:35.740 --> 29:39.005
You guys, I just had the best idea
for our phila-tropy.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.408
Philanthropy.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.606
We are gonna volunteer
at Oliver's nursing home.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.342
Who is Oliver?

29:45.416 --> 29:48.476
He's this guy I just met. He's really sweet.

29:48.553 --> 29:49.918
And he's kind of cute, too.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.488
Well...

29:52.557 --> 29:57.358
I don't know if you guys can recognize this,
but Shelley is meeting guys.

29:57.428 --> 30:00.192
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we will learn how to meet guys.

30:00.265 --> 30:04.258
Then more girls'll wanna hang out with us.
Hence, more pledges.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.428
Yeah. Hence!

30:06.504 --> 30:08.233
Okay, here's what we need to do.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.742
We need to get all dressed up,
and then we need to go to a club

30:11.810 --> 30:15.337
and drink fruity drinks
and dirty-dance with each other.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.110
- Why?
- To bond, y'old grumpy.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.111
Yeah, y'old grumpy. To bond.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.384
The music's playing.
Our bodies are swaying.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.855
You know what I'm saying?

30:26.925 --> 30:30.793
You know? We could like play
some form of dodge ball, maybe.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.367
We could tie our shoes together,
our tennis shoes,

30:36.434 --> 30:39.062
and we could throw them
over telephone wires.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.195
Because I see that everywhere,

30:40.271 --> 30:42.831
and it seems like people would
have fun doing that.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.932
Like, "How hard can you throw?"

30:45.009 --> 30:48.240
You know what I mean? Like how...
What are you...

30:51.482 --> 30:53.609
Or we could go to a club.

31:07.799 --> 31:11.166
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.967
Here's to Zetas,
to making you guys the best sorority ever.

31:17.742 --> 31:20.643
Oh, Mona, that guy is totally
checking you out.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.613
- Go flirt with him.
- Right.

31:23.681 --> 31:26.343
Think of it as research, Mona. Research.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.408
Get over there. Get on that horse!

31:28.486 --> 31:30.613
Go, go. Go!

31:34.959 --> 31:36.290
You like what you see, stud?

31:36.361 --> 31:39.125
I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at, metalface.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.688
Let me guess, is it a Hannibal Lecter thing?

31:41.766 --> 31:43.199
Yeah, it is.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.068
There's a big box of cutesicles.

31:52.143 --> 31:53.838
Carrie Mae, go work your magic.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.039
The only magic I've ever done
was try to figure out a way

31:56.114 --> 32:00.244
to stay in college for nine years
and not go back to my trailer park in Idaho.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.219
So, figure out a way into his heart.

32:03.288 --> 32:07.122
Just go over there
and talk to him about any old thing.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.864
Excuse me, you know where the crapper is?

32:13.932 --> 32:16.526
I have to drop off some timber.

32:18.369 --> 32:19.836
Go away.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.037
What'd I do?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.541
It's okay. It's just, Carrie Mae, sometimes

32:25.610 --> 32:29.444
men like their women
with a little bit of mystery.

32:29.547 --> 32:32.482
So, get back over there and try it again.

32:37.388 --> 32:38.821
Excuse me.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.024
You know where the crapper is?

32:41.092 --> 32:44.118
I have to do a very mysterious thing
in there.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.630
Drop off some timber.

32:48.032 --> 32:50.865
I'm definitely not drunk enough for that.

32:54.605 --> 32:57.972
Well, this is good, though.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.237
This is really good practice.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.312
Hey, it's the Zetas.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.642
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.376
I feel like we never see you guys out.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.941
We never see them out, either.

33:08.019 --> 33:10.749
I met you yesterday.
I was that homeless girl.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.289
Now I'm their house mom.

33:12.357 --> 33:15.019
Congratulations. That's awesome.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.857
So, hey, you guys got here just in time.

33:17.929 --> 33:22.161
We're doing a little karaoke contest.
Sororities versus fraternities.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.724
Yeah, you guys can go next if you want.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.292
Yeah! Come on!

33:26.371 --> 33:30.137
Oh, girls! Always say "yes" to karaoke.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.639
Yeah, we'll pick a great song for you.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.871
Don't worry,
you can't be any worse than we were.

33:34.946 --> 33:37.107
- Seriously, we were wretched.
- Awful.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.081
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay. Okay, listen.

33:39.150 --> 33:43.086
Just give me a second.
I promise the Zetas are going up on stage.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.712
Awesome. Great.

33:45.456 --> 33:48.050
You guys, karaoke is so fun!

33:48.126 --> 33:51.527
You gotta get up there and do karaoke.
Boys like singing. It's sexy.

33:51.596 --> 33:55.327
Go! Go! Get up there! Go! Go!

33:56.434 --> 33:58.061
I think we can do it.

33:58.136 --> 34:00.400
We can do anything better
than those mannequins, you guys.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.439
I might puke, but let's do it!

34:02.507 --> 34:04.270
That's the spirit!

34:05.276 --> 34:09.007
All right! Get up there, you Bravehearts!

34:12.984 --> 34:15.578
<i>All right, that was Kappa Eta Sigma!</i>

34:20.291 --> 34:23.021
<i>Next up, the Zetas?</i>

34:24.362 --> 34:26.728
<i>Singing Like A Virgin.</i>

34:34.539 --> 34:37.531
<i>I made it through the wilderness</i>

34:38.176 --> 34:41.440
<i>Somehow I made it through</i>

34:43.414 --> 34:48.545
<i>Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you</i>

34:50.254 --> 34:53.985
<i>I was beat, incomplete</i>

34:54.058 --> 34:58.586
<i>I'm a hag and I'm fat and rude</i>

34:58.663 --> 35:01.427
<i>But you made me feel</i>

35:02.300 --> 35:05.235
<i>Yeah, you made me feel</i>

35:05.303 --> 35:09.933
<i>Like a big bag of poop</i>

35:10.374 --> 35:12.342
<i>Like a loser</i>

35:13.711 --> 35:17.272
<i>We're rejected all the time</i>

35:18.416 --> 35:22.182
<i>Like a loser</i>

35:22.253 --> 35:26.189
<i>Who's so retarded, it's a crime</i>

35:26.257 --> 35:28.054
<i>Like a...</i>

35:38.035 --> 35:39.900
That was not nice.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.100
Awesome.

35:42.173 --> 35:44.164
You wanna get cut, bitch?

35:44.242 --> 35:47.177
Oh, classy. Very classy.

35:47.245 --> 35:51.341
No, no, no, no, she's right, Courtney.
I mean, we should apologize.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.315
Especially since we're
about to take their house.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.944
- Oh, right.
- Where are you taking it?

35:56.020 --> 35:58.682
Well, we heard that you were
losing your charter,

35:58.756 --> 36:03.022
so Phi lota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on sale after rush.

36:03.094 --> 36:07.497
Yes, we are going to have so many pledges,
we'll need all of the extra space.

36:07.565 --> 36:08.964
Oh, but don't worry.

36:09.033 --> 36:12.161
I mean, we'll still let you guys stay on
and be the maids.

36:12.236 --> 36:15.967
You can sweep the chimney.
Won't that be nice?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.905
Does the little one understand human talk?

36:17.975 --> 36:20.842
Oh, and I guess
that when we buy your house,

36:20.912 --> 36:22.812
you'll go back to being homeless.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.074
I'm a housemother.

36:24.148 --> 36:27.640
A Zeta housemother, and I don't like
some of the things you were saying.

36:27.718 --> 36:31.154
Because they do understand human talk,
and you hurt their feelings.

36:31.222 --> 36:33.213
Oh, Shelley, come on.
It's not worth it, let's go.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.758
Yeah, you should go.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.156
It was so nice to see you.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.216
But I really think that...

36:37.295 --> 36:38.455
- So nice.
- So nice.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.691
That was so humiliating, you guys.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.961
I know it was awful.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.629
And I am so mad
that they did that to you guys,

36:46.704 --> 36:50.105
but we can't listen to those girls.

36:50.174 --> 36:53.075
Why? They're right. We are losers.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.135
Oh, we're not losers.

36:55.746 --> 36:58.112
You just ignore that dumb old wall.

36:59.250 --> 37:03.311
Well, you're not a loser, Shelley.
People like you. You're pretty.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.379
I just don't understand
that kind of behavior.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.490
Trust me.

37:08.559 --> 37:12.996
You guys, I can make you way hotter
than any old Phi lota Mu.

37:13.864 --> 37:18.233
By the time I'm done,
every girl on campus'll want to pledge Zeta.

37:18.302 --> 37:21.203
No, really, we are just a bunch of misfits.

37:22.707 --> 37:26.666
Lilly just texted me from the closet.
She says we're not misfits.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.336
Well, I hope she was being ironic.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.247
Go, go, go, go, go!

37:31.315 --> 37:32.475
- Are we doing this?
- Do it!

37:32.550 --> 37:34.177
- All right.
- Here.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.117
You can do this.

37:36.187 --> 37:40.180
If I thought you all were quitting...
My heart would just fall out of my head.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.590
Shelley, your heart is not in your head.

37:42.660 --> 37:46.255
Your heart has its own cavity.
Right under your fake boobs.

37:46.330 --> 37:47.957
Do you understand how moronic you sound

37:48.032 --> 37:51.024
when you say
your heart is gonna fall out of your head?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.592
Well, Mona,

37:53.170 --> 37:57.231
I totally understand
why that saying sounds mixed-up,

37:57.308 --> 37:59.572
but I don't mean it for real.

37:59.644 --> 38:03.011
I don't think that my heart is in my skull.

38:03.080 --> 38:08.074
What I mean is that sometimes
logic tells you to do something,

38:08.152 --> 38:11.610
but you have to have part
of your heart in it as well.

38:12.089 --> 38:17.186
My head and my heart tell me
that we can save Zeta.

38:18.362 --> 38:23.231
We need 30 pledges,
and I know just how to do it.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.593
By making you guys
the hottest girls on campus.

38:33.377 --> 38:34.810
I'll get it.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.145
- Does that say "Zeta"?
- Yeah.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.488
This is war.

38:46.557 --> 38:48.149
Enough is enough.

38:48.225 --> 38:51.422
Let's do this. There's no way
those bitches are getting our house.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.668
Okay, ladies,
dressing sexy is all about skimplifying.

39:08.746 --> 39:12.045
I want you to show skin
in the four major regions.

39:12.116 --> 39:15.279
Arms, legs, belly and cleavage.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.718
Is this how you skimplify?

39:16.787 --> 39:20.484
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we could let
someone who doesn't have a giant baby

39:20.558 --> 39:22.287
in their belly give it a try.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.922
Okay, this is your most important
secret weapon, the water bra.

39:26.997 --> 39:29.056
Just stay away from sharp corners.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.067
This is going too far.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.400
No. No way. No.

39:34.338 --> 39:37.501
Just consider it like another thesis topic,
you know?

39:37.575 --> 39:41.011
"Conventional Archetypes of Beauty
and Their Effect on the Opposite Sex."

39:47.952 --> 39:49.180
Are you sure that's everything?

39:49.253 --> 39:53.952
Because feeling good on the inside
is all about looking good on the outside.

39:59.296 --> 40:01.526
Go ahead and keep that one.

40:01.599 --> 40:04.693
There are three rules to successful flirtation.

40:04.769 --> 40:08.170
Eye contact, flattery and lots of touching.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.470
For example,
let's pretend that Natalie here is a man.

40:11.542 --> 40:15.410
I'm touching his arm,
I'm looking deep into his eyes

40:15.479 --> 40:18.004
and I'm wearing deodorant. Carrie Mae?

40:18.082 --> 40:19.344
I know.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.908
And I might say something like this.

40:21.986 --> 40:26.047
"Oh, my gosh.
Your biceps are huge. Kiss me."

40:26.624 --> 40:30.287
And then he would kiss me.
So, any questions?

40:30.361 --> 40:32.727
What do I do with my chew?

40:32.797 --> 40:34.162
How long would the kiss usually be?

40:34.231 --> 40:37.462
And, also, why would he kiss you,
because you...

40:41.238 --> 40:44.765
Okay, ladies, today's lesson is makeup.

40:44.842 --> 40:47.538
First, we must highlight your eyes.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.478
The eyes are the nipples of the face.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.161
Whoa.

41:47.838 --> 41:48.930
Wow.

41:49.573 --> 41:52.041
So this is what it feels like
to not be invisible.

41:52.109 --> 41:55.738
We weren't exactly invisible before,
just the anti-hot.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.478
Check out Joanne.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.346
I really like what you've done
with the Bedazzler.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.351
- Thank you.
- It's nice.

42:02.419 --> 42:03.511
So what's next, Shelley?

42:03.587 --> 42:06.954
I want all the fraternities to see
how hot you guys are.

42:07.024 --> 42:10.824
Kind of like a coming-out party.
So we are gonna take some pictures.

42:10.895 --> 42:13.227
<i>Oh, we are not posing for Playboy.</i>

42:13.297 --> 42:16.994
No, in a calendar. "The Girls of Zeta."

42:17.067 --> 42:18.762
Everyone will see the new you,

42:18.836 --> 42:22.533
and selling the calendars will help us
raise money for our phil-an-coppopopy.

42:22.606 --> 42:24.733
Hey, you guys, Lilly just texted me.

42:24.808 --> 42:27.504
She says we look hot and this is fun.

42:33.250 --> 42:36.879
Keep doing that, keep doing that.
Make love to the camera.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.148
<i>I saw that in Austin Powers.</i>

42:40.224 --> 42:45.059
Yeah, work it. Think really sexy witch.

42:45.129 --> 42:48.656
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
- A good witch.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.757
I think you're a bad witch.

42:50.834 --> 42:55.362
I bet the house that falls on you is gonna
be a sexy house.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.374
Work it. Work it.

42:58.442 --> 43:02.208
You're like a supermodel,
except more pregnant. Keep going.

43:20.864 --> 43:25.460
Okay, Henry, very glad you finally learned
how to use the suggestion box.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.902
And I want to let you know
that I got your message,

43:27.972 --> 43:30.065
you want less Boggle and more bingo.

43:30.140 --> 43:32.233
So I'm gonna work on it, okay?

43:32.309 --> 43:35.244
Whoa.
Okay, what's going on with your heart?

43:35.913 --> 43:37.710
Shelley, you're here.

43:39.650 --> 43:41.481
- Move out of the way, man.
- Move it, Junior.

43:41.552 --> 43:42.951
- Sideways.
- Sorry, sorry.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.785
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.151
We brought a donation
as part of our philtrophy.

43:50.227 --> 43:52.559
Oh, great. Thank you.

43:53.330 --> 43:54.695
We're making calendars,

43:54.765 --> 43:56.858
and before we could even get them all out,

43:56.934 --> 43:59.562
the printing-press guys bought up
the first batch.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.662
Wow. Great, thank you very much.

44:01.739 --> 44:05.266
This is, "Pay to the Order of Old People."

44:06.610 --> 44:08.544
Yes, and it doesn't stop there.

44:08.612 --> 44:13.447
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few
extra volunteers to help out today.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.845
Henry, Henry, look away. Look away, okay?

44:17.921 --> 44:22.585
Look at the wall.
Think of broccoli and bad bingo cards.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.821
You know, actually, your timing is perfect,

44:24.895 --> 44:28.592
because I was about to try
and organize a dance class.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.190
Nobody signed up.

44:30.267 --> 44:33.293
And I was at the top of the list
not signing up.

44:33.370 --> 44:36.931
There ain't no way I'm dancing.
You can forget that.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.305
Oh, I love to dance.

44:39.376 --> 44:40.638
Well, let's do it.

44:43.947 --> 44:46.882
Okay, ladies, fan out and find a partner.

44:49.319 --> 44:52.948
And maybe we should talk
about this music.

44:54.591 --> 44:57.583
Wow, this music is super, super-great,

44:57.661 --> 45:01.995
but we might want to try
something a little sexier.

45:17.281 --> 45:19.010
Great job, ladies.

45:32.963 --> 45:36.194
Shelley, I just want to thank you so much
for doing this.

45:36.266 --> 45:37.358
It's just so kind.

45:37.434 --> 45:41.962
Oh, well, kindness is just love
with its work boots on.

45:42.940 --> 45:45.465
Hey, Oliver, ask the girl to dance.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.844
- I'd love to.
- Really?

45:51.415 --> 45:53.144
Looking good, Jean.

45:54.651 --> 45:59.179
So, listen, Shelley, I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to have dinner sometime.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.656
Really? Yes. Yeah.

46:02.126 --> 46:03.354
Great.

46:04.561 --> 46:07.428
- Bitchsuck!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.227
Oh, it's all good.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.865
I'm so glad to be back.

46:13.937 --> 46:17.896
Marvin, tell Shelley we're back
and we're gonna be watching a movie.

46:17.975 --> 46:19.602
How about something spooky? No, funny.

46:19.676 --> 46:21.871
<i>No. How about Scarface?</i>

46:21.945 --> 46:24.175
No, you guys,
I think it should be Shelley's pick tonight.

46:24.248 --> 46:28.947
Mr. Hefner, Shelley's actually gone.
She told me to give you this letter.

46:38.028 --> 46:41.395
Shelley moved to Africa
to work with the orphans.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.659
She left while we were gone

46:42.733 --> 46:45.759
because she says
she can't deal with goodbyes.

46:47.738 --> 46:50.434
I'm going to bed. No movies tonight.

46:53.343 --> 46:55.140
You look nervous.

46:55.212 --> 46:58.613
I don't like when you look nervous.
You will not blow this!

46:58.682 --> 46:59.876
But I just wanna mix drinks.

46:59.950 --> 47:02.180
You know, my whole life,
that's all I've ever wanted to do,

47:02.252 --> 47:03.947
is just blend.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.785
And then you come along
with your weird kryptonite death grip, and...

47:06.857 --> 47:09.257
- That's right, it's like this.
- Oh, good God!

47:09.326 --> 47:10.884
Oh, sweet bastard, that's good.

47:10.961 --> 47:14.294
That's right, and I'm the only woman
that can make you feel like that.

47:14.364 --> 47:17.891
You will not tell Hef
that we wrote that letter to Shelley.

47:17.968 --> 47:19.196
- Just do it again.
- Got it?

47:19.269 --> 47:22.136
- Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. So I got it.
- Good.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.073
Hi. I'll take two calendars.

47:34.151 --> 47:37.780
Wow. That's so generous.
Everyone's been buying two.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.653
Actually, it's in case one gets ruined.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.853
Hot dogs, Zeta hot dogs. Who wants one?

47:43.927 --> 47:46.418
You. You. You got one.

47:50.934 --> 47:52.834
Sweet setup here.

47:53.904 --> 47:56.896
We should totally have a mixer
with you guys sometime.

47:56.974 --> 47:58.168
Yeah.

48:02.813 --> 48:04.474
<i>We could have one with Battle...</i>

48:04.548 --> 48:06.038
What? One more time.

48:06.149 --> 48:09.641
<i>We could have a Battlestar Galactica night.
With pudding!</i>

48:09.720 --> 48:11.745
Definitely! What?

48:11.822 --> 48:13.687
<i>Battlestar Galactica. Okay.</i>

48:13.757 --> 48:17.853
She said that you guys should get together
some night, with pudding.

48:18.528 --> 48:19.688
Whoa.

48:20.297 --> 48:22.527
You betcha. You betcha.

48:22.599 --> 48:26.797
At Phi lota Mu we are very exclusive,
because we can be.

48:26.870 --> 48:30.067
Many of our sisters are leaders on campus.

48:30.140 --> 48:35.373
We have a rocking GPA
and our very own Korean manicurist.

48:41.485 --> 48:43.646
Hey, where are you guys going?

48:43.720 --> 48:46.689
- Whose booth is that?
- That's Zeta's booth.

48:47.291 --> 48:50.089
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they have a booth?

48:50.160 --> 48:51.252
And who would go to it?

48:51.328 --> 48:53.387
- Do you want some ketchup?
- That'd be great.

48:53.463 --> 48:55.761
I can totally hose you some right there.
Go ahead, lean back.

48:55.832 --> 48:57.663
No, I'm just...

49:01.471 --> 49:03.769
- Excuse me.
- Why, did you fart?

49:04.675 --> 49:06.802
- Did I do what?
- Fart.

49:08.979 --> 49:10.412
Where are the Zetas?

49:10.480 --> 49:12.812
We are the Zetas, 2008 edition.

49:12.883 --> 49:14.646
And I'm in love!

49:27.364 --> 49:29.059
Why'd you do that?

49:29.132 --> 49:31.225
I needed to hurt someone.

49:34.538 --> 49:37.769
This is so awesome, you guys.
That was so much fun!

49:37.841 --> 49:39.433
It was, it was.

49:39.509 --> 49:42.501
Harmony, Brian Stone was all over you, girl.

49:43.447 --> 49:44.675
- And how about Mona?
- What?

49:44.748 --> 49:47.615
I got numbers from four boys.
It was all for research.

49:47.684 --> 49:48.742
Liar.

49:48.819 --> 49:51.083
- Careful what you research.
- But I really had fun.

49:51.154 --> 49:56.251
Well, Natalie, Colby was
following you around like a puppy dog.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.856
Do you guys think you'll, you know...

50:01.198 --> 50:02.290
No.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.302
I do not think, you know, that.

50:07.738 --> 50:08.966
"That"?

50:10.574 --> 50:13.509
Natalie, are you a virgin?

50:14.711 --> 50:16.076
No.

50:16.913 --> 50:19.074
Am I a virgin? No.

50:19.916 --> 50:21.076
You're a virgin!

50:21.151 --> 50:24.382
Shelley! It's like an amphitheater in here!

50:24.454 --> 50:26.012
That's it.

50:26.089 --> 50:28.319
Oh, my gosh.
We have to have an Aztec party.

50:28.392 --> 50:29.757
We always wanted
to have one at the Mansion,

50:29.826 --> 50:32.954
but we could never find a virgin to sacrifice.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.999
Natalie, it is gonna be the best time ever.

50:36.066 --> 50:40.867
We are gonna have the most rockingest
party, and then we'll get our 30 pledges.

50:55.185 --> 50:57.176
Okay, quick trick, watch this.

50:57.254 --> 51:00.348
We are gonna put little trails of Vaseline
on the contours of our abs,

51:00.424 --> 51:04.258
mist it a little,
and that way the light will catch our tans.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.524
Oh, she says
you're completely ingenious, Shelley.

51:09.599 --> 51:11.328
Thank you, Lilly.

51:11.401 --> 51:12.891
That's the same as vapid, right?

51:12.969 --> 51:15.267
Oh, it's better than vapid.

51:15.338 --> 51:18.501
- Is that Juicy?
- Yeah, I love their stuff.

51:18.575 --> 51:21.942
It's a shame nobody'd be able to see it,
you know, under my brace.

51:22.012 --> 51:24.207
Well, when can you take the brace off?

51:24.281 --> 51:26.909
2004, actually.

51:28.185 --> 51:30.085
Well, it's a good thing I asked.

51:30.153 --> 51:35.557
No, I'm so fine.
I mean, you know, it's all indented into me

51:35.625 --> 51:38.617
and, you know, if I took it off, I wouldn't
even know what would possibly happen,

51:38.695 --> 51:41.289
and my spine could be like a noodle. And...

51:41.364 --> 51:43.798
I'm really good. I'm good. Thanks.

51:45.836 --> 51:47.303
Come with me.

51:48.004 --> 51:50.700
Joanne, when I was little,
I wore a Scooby-Doo mask to school

51:50.774 --> 51:53.174
for a whole month
because I thought I was ugly.

51:53.243 --> 51:54.471
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome.

51:54.544 --> 51:56.774
And then one day
a boy, Howard Rubenstock,

51:56.847 --> 51:59.338
snuck up behind me and tore it off my face.

51:59.416 --> 52:02.408
- Do you know what I realized?
- That you were pretty?

52:02.486 --> 52:05.148
No, that I was wearing it upside down.

52:05.755 --> 52:08.053
I'm not really sure
what you're trying to tell me, Shelley.

52:08.125 --> 52:12.528
I'm not either. But the point is,
you're a butterfly now, not an earthworm.

52:12.596 --> 52:14.621
You don't need to hide anymore.

52:14.698 --> 52:17.223
So, okay, here he comes.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.167
He runs past here every day,
and I've seen you staring at him.

52:20.237 --> 52:22.205
I can tell that you like him
and that you want to talk to him.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.866
Today's the day. Go invite him to our party.

52:24.941 --> 52:26.374
Go. Go.

52:31.448 --> 52:33.245
Run, Joanne, run!

53:00.644 --> 53:01.770
Hi, Steve.

53:01.845 --> 53:04.905
Oh, hey, Joanne. How are you?
I didn't know you ran.

53:04.981 --> 53:07.142
Sure, I mean, I do now.

53:07.217 --> 53:08.582
Where's your brace?

53:08.652 --> 53:10.517
- It's gone.
- Really?

53:16.693 --> 53:18.251
Well.

53:18.328 --> 53:20.489
You're pretty pleased with yourself,
aren't you?

53:20.564 --> 53:24.159
Oh, you scared me.
My heart's pounding like a nail.

53:25.802 --> 53:28.202
I guess I am a little proud.

53:28.271 --> 53:30.637
Well, don't get too used to that feeling.

53:30.707 --> 53:33.801
Because there's no way that I'm going
to let a whorey little tart like you

53:33.877 --> 53:36.573
stand in the way of the Phi lota Mu.

53:37.247 --> 53:39.272
Don't mess with me.

53:39.349 --> 53:41.613
Don't mess with Phi lota Mu.

53:46.523 --> 53:51.392
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi
massage combo, pronto.

53:51.461 --> 53:52.553
- Shelley!
- Oh, my...

53:52.629 --> 53:54.995
Steve said he's gonna come
to the Aztec party.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.589
Steve, he's gonna come.

53:56.666 --> 53:59.294
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun!

54:16.419 --> 54:19.877
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- God! Oh, my God!

54:19.956 --> 54:22.151
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys! Look.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.124
Oh, Joanne.

54:24.961 --> 54:27.930
I can bend! You guys, I did it, I can bend!

54:31.534 --> 54:34.298
"Do you find yourself
more attracted to me when I'm like this,

54:34.371 --> 54:36.032
"or like this?"

54:37.107 --> 54:39.007
- The second one.
- Great.

54:39.542 --> 54:41.806
So, "Because you like my boobs,

54:41.878 --> 54:45.109
"would you stand there
and let me go like this

54:46.016 --> 54:49.179
"for five minutes,
just in the hope that we might hook up?"

54:49.252 --> 54:51.584
Yes. Yes, I would.

54:54.924 --> 54:58.018
Guys! Anybody want some chips?

54:58.862 --> 55:00.489
Yeah, have chips while you party.

55:00.563 --> 55:03.464
Badass party. Badass.

55:03.533 --> 55:07.970
So, Miss December,
you got your bikini on under there? Huh?

55:08.038 --> 55:10.836
No, actually, just my fake water...

55:10.907 --> 55:12.534
Natalie, there you are.

55:12.609 --> 55:16.568
Oh, Bobby and Zach from Kappa are just
dying to meet you.

55:16.646 --> 55:20.104
I'm sorry, Colby,
but Natalie is a very hot commodity.

55:21.551 --> 55:23.178
- Excuse us.
- Wait.

55:23.787 --> 55:25.084
Wait a second.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.918
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.082
Why?

55:28.158 --> 55:30.626
I have, like,
the world's hugest crush on him.

55:30.694 --> 55:31.683
So I don't really...

55:31.761 --> 55:34.525
I know. Then we need to let him see
how in demand you are.

55:34.597 --> 55:37.464
Always remember,
boys want what other boys want.

55:37.534 --> 55:38.831
Right.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.896
Are you Lilly?

55:44.407 --> 55:46.739
That's a cute costume, Lil.

55:46.810 --> 55:49.142
I was gonna ask you this,
because I've been seeing these all over.

55:49.212 --> 55:51.043
I mean, this is an Aztec party,

55:51.114 --> 55:54.242
you know, so those statues don't really fit,
because those are from Easter Island,

55:54.317 --> 55:57.252
which is like 2000 miles away,
as you probably know, in Polynesia.

55:57.320 --> 56:01.586
Wait, Natalie. You're too smart.
Boys don't like girls that are too smart.

56:01.658 --> 56:02.852
Right.

56:02.926 --> 56:06.225
Right.
God, I hope Colby didn't hear me say that.

56:07.130 --> 56:09.758
Shelley, you really know all the tricks.

56:09.833 --> 56:11.425
How do you do it, you know?

56:11.501 --> 56:14.095
I mean, with Colby here
and with Oliver asking you out,

56:14.170 --> 56:17.571
it's like we might both
lose our virginity this year.

56:18.808 --> 56:20.105
Yeah.

56:24.948 --> 56:28.475
It's supposed to be a mixer.
There's no one here to mix.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.211
They're over there, aren't they? The Kappas.

56:32.288 --> 56:34.916
Well, they're definitely not here.

56:34.991 --> 56:37.687
I know that, dipswitch. I can see that.

56:41.097 --> 56:44.089
<i>And now, let the sacrificial rites begin!</i>

56:47.437 --> 56:52.238
<i>It's time for this virgin
to get sacrificed in the boiling Jell-O lava!</i>

56:53.042 --> 56:55.772
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

56:55.845 --> 56:57.938
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

56:58.014 --> 57:02.951
<i>This is Aztec Night, the first of many
awesome Zeta parties to come.</i>

57:03.019 --> 57:04.987
<i>And for those of you girls
going through rush,</i>

57:05.054 --> 57:08.182
<i>remember to make Zeta
your number-one choice!</i>

57:12.762 --> 57:14.753
The time is now.

57:46.429 --> 57:47.726
Yeah.

57:49.299 --> 57:52.359
I've never seen anybody
get sacrificed before.

57:53.236 --> 57:54.999
That was so hot.

57:55.071 --> 57:58.234
I mean, I don't know anything about Aztecs,
you know? Or their culture.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.368
But, I mean, I do know that I had fun.

58:01.444 --> 58:05.642
Yeah. I don't know anything
about them either, so that's awesome.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.716
What have the Zetas become?

58:15.792 --> 58:17.589
Oh, my God.

58:17.660 --> 58:18.888
Popular.

58:38.915 --> 58:40.576
Remember, be sexy.

58:40.650 --> 58:43.414
- He's gonna love your shoes.
- Deep breath, take a deep breath.

58:43.486 --> 58:46.421
Okay, okay, he's here. Okay.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.518
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.392
Wow, you look great.

58:55.064 --> 58:56.998
- Thank you.
- You ready?

59:02.705 --> 59:05.674
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

59:05.742 --> 59:09.269
- Would you mind if we walked?
- Oh, yes, I like to walk.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.605
And that's not the only thing I like.

59:13.683 --> 59:17.016
No? You have a wide range of interests?

59:17.487 --> 59:21.253
Oh, yes. A big range.

59:23.626 --> 59:25.958
Oh, wait here for a second.

59:26.029 --> 59:29.055
I think I dropped some money
over here the other day.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.726
I just don't know wherever could it be.

59:31.801 --> 59:34.634
Maybe it's over here by this manhole.

59:37.640 --> 59:39.608
That's fucking hot!

59:41.411 --> 59:45.780
I just went over there to look for my money

59:45.848 --> 59:48.681
which I had dropped the other day.

59:48.751 --> 59:52.482
I think it was a dollar coin,
because I heard a clanging.

59:53.222 --> 59:55.884
But anyway, wow.

59:56.793 --> 59:58.852
Who knew steam can be hot?

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.820
Yeah, that's...

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.388
I wonder what they did
when Marilyn Monroe did it.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:08.460
They probably added soothing botanicals
to the steam rising from the manhole.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.199
I like that word.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.740
"Manhole."

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.867
All right. What can I get you guys?

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:22.150
Instead of the mahi-mahi,
may I just get the one mahi,

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.482
because I'm not that hungry?

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.552
I'll ask.

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:32.187
The chicken piccata for me.
Yeah, that'd be fine.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.888
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.989
"Piccata." That's another word I like.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.161
Piccata.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:43.501
- Yeah, it just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
- Sounds like "Hotta."

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.699
Yeah.

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.440
Or "the Spanish Armada."

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.105
- I like to rhyme.
- Yeah?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.816
...and StairMaster to tone the buttock area.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:00.852
I'd show you,
but who really wants to see my butt?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:07.356
I mean, it's just a silly old butt
with no tan lines.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.465
Yep.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:15.095
Wow, this was really good food.
I hope it doesn't go straight to my butt.

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:20.439
I mean, I think my butt would still
be a pretty good one, though.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.335
Yep. My ass.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.174
Oh, well, this has been fun,

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:30.709
but we should probably wrap it up,
because I've got another date at 11.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.412
Are you serious?

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:35.651
Well, what's a girl in demand going to do?

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.756
Wow. Okay.

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:42.662
Yeah, well, dinner's on me.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:47.169
I'm gonna get going. I wouldn't want you
to keep the other guy waiting.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.000
Wait!

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.541
Your biceps are huge! Kiss me.

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.503
Oh, my God.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.513
Yeah, right.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:07.385
Shelley's back.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.017
- How'd it go?
- How'd it go, Shelley?

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.591
Not good.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.493
- What?
- Why?

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.532
I don't think he likes me.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:19.227
He didn't fall for any of my tricks.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.561
That's impossible, your tricks always work.

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:27.132
I did sexy, I did "other guys want me."

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.145
You know, I worked every angle in the book.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.841
But I don't know, he just stared.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:36.208
What if Oliver is one of those guys

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:39.448
who wants to have, like, a conversation
with a girl before he hooks up with her?

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.819
He's gay?

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.253
No, he's not gay.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.962
Oh, I don't know.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:53.832
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe he wants to talk first.

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:56.895
What if Oliver doesn't mind a smart girl?

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.632
- I know.
- Wait.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.543
So I have to learn things
about things and stuff?

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.006
About topics?

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.215
- Can I even do that?
- Yeah. You can do that.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:13.482
You can do anything
you set your mind to, Shelley.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.297
But you can't even tell I have boobs.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.770
Well, don't you think I should show him
a little something?

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.205
Give him a little philanthropy?

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:42.267
Shelley, good job.
You used "philanthropy." That was fun.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:45.246
You know what? You're still too sexy.

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.282
Nat, what if she wears your glasses?

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.682
Good idea. Okay, here.

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:51.710
Try these.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:57.383
Oh, my God. Natalie, you should really
go to an eye doctor.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.258
That's actually how I got those glasses.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.092
So have you called Oliver yet?

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:05.395
Yes. He didn't seem too excited
to be going out on a second date,

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:08.528
but he said yes, so here goes.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:12.040
All right. Now remember,
just be yourself, only different.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.440
- Don't use the word "elucidate."
- Pretty much entirely different.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.307
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Tone down the sexuality.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:19.177
Talk about politics and religion.
That's always a really good first-date topic.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.682
- Don't stare at him too much.
- Don't brush your teeth.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.082
- Bye, Shell.
- Bye.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:26.610
- Don't forget to call, Shelley.
- Say you're nauseous.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:31.856
A nuclear nonproliferation treaty
should ease tension in Asia.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.362
Well, that's my thought.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.864
- Are you okay? With your...
- Oh, yes.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.061
These glasses don't make me dizzy
or anything.

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.703
Elucidate on that.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:48.173
Well, you seem to know a lot
about North Korea and the Middle East.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.109
It sounds like you really read the paper.

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:54.445
Oh, all the time.
I am just nuts about the paper.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:58.544
So, have you given any thought
to who you might be voting for?

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.384
I'm not sure yet.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:05.191
I definitely won't listen to what Simon says.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:07.058
He is just so mean.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:10.257
I usually always agree
with Paula and Randy.

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:16.195
Oh, you meant
the President of the United States.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.771
The United States of America.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.639
U.S.A. for short.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:27.115
Fifty states, if you include Hawaii.
Most people do. I'm definitely pro-Hawaii.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.878
- Excuse me.
- Oh, thank God.

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.646
Can I get you anything else?

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.711
No, I think we're good, thanks.

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:36.485
Hey, I know where I know you from.

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:39.687
<i>You were in Playboy.
"Girls with GEDs," right?</i>

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.320
Oh, heck, no!

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.357
No!

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:47.402
Those girls are all boobs and no brains.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:52.100
I'm too busy in a library,
reading books with dust on them.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:53.266
How...

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.537
Sorry. My mistake, then. Sorry.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.805
No.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:00.774
<i>Playboy. God. Can you believe it?</i>

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:04.844
I'm still hungry, even though we just ate.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.889
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I did that.

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.822
- Sorry, let me take care of that.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.692
Are those index cards?

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:17.597
No. Index... They're napkins.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:20.726
They're not index cards
with writing on them.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:24.062
Let me get some more napkins.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.631
That's okay, really. I think...

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.381
Sweet balls!

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.646
I can't believe that happened.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.053
I'm sorry about all the gravity.

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:42.852
Are you all right?

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.726
I'm sorry, Oliver.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.501
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.001
I need to go.

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:17.548
Come on, Puffin,
you've been in here for days.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:20.823
Let's watch a movie,
it'll make you feel better.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.158
I don't get it.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:25.700
Why would Shelley just leave?

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.100
It's for the best. She wasn't happy.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.606
I used to hear her crying
in her room late at night.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.374
I think I'd like to be alone for a bit.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.606
I could stay with you.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.609
No, just bring me more ice cream.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.417
Egg! Paprika!

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.719
Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:55.153
What have I done to poor Shelley?

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:59.158
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.066
No. You can't.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:05.095
I'm gonna be the next Miss November,
not that little blonde bitch.

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:09.234
You found my weakness,
used it against me like kryptonite,

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.904
but that's never gonna happen again.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.712
"Oh, Mr. Hefner..."

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:19.149
Guys, remember, we only need 30, okay?

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.023
First up,

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.819
Kristen Withers.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.986
Pre-med, family in Greenwich.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.528
- Yeah, so cute.
- I like.

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:29.188
Cute, cute. Totally.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.323
- No doubt.
- Very cute.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.923
- In.
- Guys...

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.868
We just made our first pledge acceptance.

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:40.832
Okay, cool. All right. Next up, Jill Palmer.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:45.243
Colorado, theater major...
Her father owns, like, half of Aspen.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:46.576
- Yes.
- Yeah!

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:57.157
Why am I such a yummy dummy?

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.591
Next one.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:04.163
Nancy Nagle. English major from Florida.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.160
But she does drive a Porsche.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:09.534
I just don't know about this one.
I kind of feel like we've created this image.

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.505
I just don't feel like she's gonna fit in.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.414
I'm just saying, she should have spent
the Porsche money on a nose job.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:24.008
She said she broke it in a skiing accident
last year, and I'm like,

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:27.715
"Okay, I'm sure the nose surgeon would
take the Porsche as a trade-in."

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.314
Booya! Snap!

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:36.355
Hello?

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.332
<i>Hey, Shelley, it's me.</i>

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.300
<i>- Hef?
- Yeah.</i>

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.497
Hef? Oh, is this you? Oh, my gosh.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:46.439
How are you?
Like, I can't believe you're calling me.

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:49.671
How is everybody at the Mansion?
How are things?

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:53.146
<i>Good news. I'm gonna make you
next month's centerfold.</i>

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.012
You're making me Miss November?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.245
<i>- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:10:57.319 --> 01:11:00.015
Are you totally serious, or is this not Hef?

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.785
If this is Hef, blink once.
If it isn't Hef, blink twice.

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:04.348
Did you blink?

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.362
I'm so glad you haven't changed, Shelley.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.591
And I want you to move
back to the Mansion.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.430
<i>It's just not the same without you here.</i>

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.930
Hef, I just can't believe it.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.064
<i>Believe it, baby.</i>

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.040
<i>Okay, here's what happens.</i>

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.545
<i>We shoot the pictorial, we'll have you do
a 25-city tour of the United States.</i>

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.807
<i>And then from there
we're gonna travel Europe,</i>

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.746
<i>ending with a one-week stay in Monaco.</i>

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.374
<i>We're gonna coordinate your pictorial</i>

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:32.511
<i>with a Playboy Channel documentary
on the life of a centerfold.</i>

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.421
<i>The exposure's going to be wonderful,
but it doesn't stop there.</i>

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.891
<i>We're going to pull out all the stops
for this one, Shelley.</i>

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.393
<i>It's going to be huge.</i>

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.894
Hef?

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.453
<i>Yeah, baby?</i>

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.397
Hef, I'm so sorry.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.936
I'm so happy that you called me.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:52.064
And I love you, but I don't think I can do it.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.200
<i>I can't leave my Zeta girls.</i>

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.538
What?

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.280
I'm not going anywhere.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:01.748
I'm home.

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.817
Katootoo Jihiman.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.582
Sociology major from India. Everyone?

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.890
I remember this one.
She seems kind of weird.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:15.088
I actually got that, too.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.860
Not like an "I live in the wall
and eat crickets" kind of weird,

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.423
but just like a little off.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.901
- Boo to Katootoo.
- Next.

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.698
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:27.666
Lilly?

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.506
Look at you people!

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:32.445
Honestly, is this really what you've become?

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:36.075
Judging other girls on their appearance?
Calling them weird?

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:38.676
I'm sure glad I joined when I did,
because honestly,

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.847
I don't think
I would make the cut these days.

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.891
And neither would a lot of you.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:46.917
I can't believe that Zeta's become
just like Phi lota Mu.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.225
A bunch of snooty bitches!

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.561
Lilly, you talked.

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.864
And you're British?

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.144
Hi, everybody. I'm home.

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.283
This is all your fault.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:16.381
Yeah. You know what, Mona? You're right.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:19.757
It all started with this fake hair
and your stupid water bras.

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:22.319
You know what?
Before you got here, we were individuals.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.525
You've turned us all into stupid bimbos.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.568
- We were fine the way we were.
- We look ridiculous.

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.660
- I'm getting Cs in all my classes.
- Why am I looking like this?

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.967
- This isn't who I am.
- I can't believe you let me do this to myself.

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.507
Guys, stop. Come on, stop, stop.

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.667
Guys.

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.077
I understand, and I'm sorry.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.442
So I...

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.544
Thank you guys for everything.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:50.581
I'm gonna go, and I really hope
to see you guys in the future.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.256
Shelley.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:05.535
Hi, Hef, it's Shelley.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.871
I was just kidding, silly.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.674
I can't wait to be back at the Mansion
and be a centerfold.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.841
This is the happiest day of my life.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.546
<i>Dear Oliver,</i>

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.281
<i>I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you
this in person.</i>

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:23.654
<i>It was way too embarrassing
to face you after everything.</i>

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:27.354
<i>I am leaving the Zeta house
to fulfill my lifelong dream.</i>

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:32.932
<i>And I know that what I've decided to do
won't make any sense to you at all,</i>

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.798
<i>but I have joined the Peace Corps,</i>

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:39.068
<i>and I'm going off to work in the mountains
of a country called Peru.</i>

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:43.239
<i>I'm going to meet lots of interesting people.</i>

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.644
<i>I'm sure it'll be very hot where I'm going.</i>

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.375
<i>And even though it's going to be super-hot,</i>

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:51.408
<i>I will be bundled up in clothes,
barely showing any flesh.</i>

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.546
<i>I only tell you that because
I don't want you to worry</i>

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.749
<i>about me getting sunburned.</i>

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:01.056
Hef told me what you did,
and I don't think it was very sisterly of you.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:03.029
You are so vapid.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:08.695
Actually, I'm ingenious and philanthropic,
and you're a backstabbing bitch.

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.796
- Nice, Shelley. That was awesome.
- Shelley!

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.003
<i>I hope everybody at the old folks' home
is doing great.</i>

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.445
<i>And as for the Zeta girls,
I'm sure they're doing fine.</i>

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:23.474
<i>Oliver, I hope you think of me
every once in a while, and when you do,</i>

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:25.486
<i>I hope they are good thoughts.</i>

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:26.612
Pooter!

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.349
<i>Love, Shelley.</i>

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.254
There you are.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.892
So we'll be half Shelley
and half who we really are.

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.892
Can we be 60% Shelley?

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:43.131
I mean, say what you want about her,
but the girl had style.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.003
- What?
- "She had style"?

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:49.900
She still does. I mean, she just wants
to be back at the Playboy Mansion.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.412
Well, whatever we're gonna be,
we need to figure out, you guys.

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:57.384
We still need 30 pledges by October 15th,
or we can just kiss it all goodbye.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:16:00.444
Who wants to be a part of something real?
Zeta.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.649
Hi. Zeta. Tell 29 of your friends.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:06.922
Listen up, ladies! Zeta was founded
on the tenets of sisterhood,

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.826
friendship and philanthropy.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:09.989
Here you go.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:13.296
Yeah, and since then, we've added some
pretty kick-ass parties to the list.

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:15.233
Yeah, but instead of judging and rejecting,

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.330
we'll put all the pledges we get into a bowl,
and we'll draw 30 names out.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.898
Natalie? What'd you do to your hair?

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:23.410
- I could change it back.
- Why?

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.002
Everyone gets haircuts.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.605
People have lots of different styles
all over the world.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:31.710
In China,
they usually tend to layer it, I've noticed.

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.881
This isn't China, though. So, I just...
You know, I could put it back to how it was.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.585
Oh, no, no. Why, why, why? You look great.

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.724
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.162
Well, I mean, you looked great before,
with the hair.

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:46.632
But, I mean, this feels more you.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:49.535
I mean, besides,
it's not like I want you to be my girlfriend

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.506
just because of your hairstyle. So...

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.371
Your girlfriend?

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:57.537
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:58.705
It's kind of presumptuous.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.749
It's like, "Hey, you wanna be my girlfriend?
Sit next to me."

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.808
No, no.
I mean, you don't want to be my girlfriend.

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:07.116
You got guys falling from trees for you,
and it's like...

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.953
Here I am, just a goofy dude.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.783
"Goofy dude"?

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:20.299
Colby, I want to be your girlfriend more
than an electron wants to attach to a proton.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.037
- That much?
- Yeah.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:29.636
Yeah?

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.646
What? What?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.883
Did I mess that up?
Because I can do that so much better.

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:45.819
No, I was just thanking Shelley.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.128
Oh. Thank you, Shelley.

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:59.173
Okay, guys. Close your eyes.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:07.276
This is it. We're gonna keep the Zeta house.

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:10.681
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta!

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:11.980
Lilly, go mail the bids.

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.386
Hi.

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.655
Are you new on campus?

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.528
I don't think we've ever met.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.693
I'm Cole. Cole Trickle.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.136
Yes. Yes, I just transferred.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.106
My name is Lilly.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.877
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:41.909
That girl over there just
dropped these on the floor,

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:44.315
and she's really into that guy.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.718
- And I don't want to interrupt her.
- Okay.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.949
- Can you mail these out for her?
- Sure thing.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.548
Thank you.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:53.822
You should totally
mail me your number sometime.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.419
Okay.

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:58.398
Just give it to me. I have a great memory.

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.525
Where are my envelopes?

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:04.402
Oh, you dropped them, but I got it,
and they're gonna be mailed right out.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.703
Oh, thank you so much.

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:10.939
- Okay, my number's 7-6...
- Anyways, it was great meeting you, Nelly.

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:13.978
Oh, but my name is Lilly, actually.

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.641
Yeah, whatever.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.879
Bye.

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.920
Now can I see your pizzanties?

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.082
No.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:35.766
I don't get it.

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:38.101
Why didn't anyone show up?

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.236
You guys, come here and look at this.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:50.277
I'm Ashley. Come on in.
Nice to meet you guys.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.787
You did send out the invitations,
didn't you?

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.120
Yes.

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.685
But there was this boy there.

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.230
And I never talked to a boy before.
You know?

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:05.858
And he distracted me. Just for a minute.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.266
And then I saw him talking to Ashley.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:11.305
And they knew each other. I could tell
by the way that they talked, and...

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:12.601
And...

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.108
I'm sorry.

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:30.057
<i>People, all right. That's enough. Let's go.</i>

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.094
<i>We're done. We're shooting Miss November,
not Miss December. Let's do this.</i>

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.789
<i>Give me the fog. Wind, let's go.
Music, let's go.</i>

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:39.459
<i>Let's shoot this. Miss November.
Immortality! Let's go!</i>

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.998
<i>All right, here we go. It's Shelley time.
Come on, Shelley, it's so hot.</i>

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:45.699
<i>Oh, yeah. Sexy.
Sell it, Shelley. Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.571
<i>You're gorgeous, Shelley. So hot!</i>

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:50.133
<i>Come on, work it, Shelley!
Come on, let's see some...</i>

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:51.236
<i>Shelley?</i>

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:54.077
<i>Stop. Stop the fog, Dave.
Barry, hold the wind, please.</i>

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.947
<i>What's wrong, babe?
You okay? You sad? Sad monkey?</i>

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.815
I don't think I'm your Miss November.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.218
<i>What?</i>

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.123
I'm sorry.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:08.021
<i>Shelley, wait. Shelley.
Shelley, come on. Shelley...</i>

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.996
<i>Is she serious?</i>

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.056
<i>Shelley! Shell-monkey!</i>

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.658
<i>Should we take a shower
and talk about it? Shelley!</i>

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.310
Natalie?

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:26.472
Oh, my gosh. How did you find me?

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.745
Oh, just... A little bird told me.

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:31.376
What bird?

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.944
Marvin called us. I thought...

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.649
We didn't think you liked us anymore.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.160
Oh, my gosh, no. I've missed you so much.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:41.695
Oh, hi, girls. Oh, my gosh.

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.663
You guys look beautiful!

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.098
Oh, I've missed you guys so much.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.998
You're the best housemother
anyone's ever had.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.264
I'm really sorry for what I said to you.

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.862
I know. We really miss you, Shelley.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.271
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:56.902
So, how'd the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pledges?

01:21:56.978 --> 01:22:00.345
Zeta had a ton of people interested,
don't get me wrong. Thanks to you.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:03.543
But nobody showed up
because Ashley stole all of our bids.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:06.280
No. So the house is gone?

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.651
They'll make it official today

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:10.452
at the Panhellenic Council meeting
this afternoon.

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.322
So there's still a chance.

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:13.418
Shelley, it's too late.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.929
I mean, I don't think there's anything
that we can do.

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:19.125
Natalie! Together we can do anything!

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:23.098
<i>Today's meeting is tinged with sadness.</i>

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:28.235
<i>Unfortunately, not all of us will be
returning next year.</i>

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:34.138
<i>Yes, that's true. So with that said,
that brings us to our last order of business.</i>

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:37.482
Stop!

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:38.712
Oh, dear.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.880
We're here to save our house.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.585
I don't know how this
big meeting stuff works, but I just...

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.183
<i>Enough with the freak show.</i>

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:50.163
<i>What I was saying,
before I was so rudely interrupted, is that...</i>

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:52.222
Hold on! Wait.

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.462
I have something to say.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.513
Shelley, say something.

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:09.311
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:13.445
<i>Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons.
Enough is enough. Do something.</i>

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:17.685
<i>Shelley? The council has come here today
to really finalize this, so...</i>

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:22.253
No! No! This is germane to our predicament.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.733
<i>Oh, well, as long as it's germane.
Please continue.</i>

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:28.792
Just give her a minute.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.573
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:39.107
I took it once when I had a cold.
I was 16, and it gave me itching.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:44.046
I mean, everything itched.
My legs, my arms, my earlobes.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.282
And other stuff, too, but I can't say,
because I'm live on the air right now,

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.755
and you can't say "ass cheeks," right?

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.314
<i>You just did.</i>

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.825
But I said it kind of quietly, I think.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:01.928
But besides the itching,
the erythromycin also made my skin glow.

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.668
It gave me, like, this glowing tan.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.573
And I suddenly felt like another person.

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.643
Different.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.710
Better.

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:15.746
Prettier, I guess.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.411
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:20.313
Michelle.

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:23.152
Michelle, do you know that feeling
that I'm talking about?

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.418
Where you suddenly feel pretty

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:27.120
and, next thing you know,
you feel better about yourself?

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.595
Well, that was what was happening to me.

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:32.929
My allergic reaction made me feel pretty,

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:37.836
and so I ignored all the bad side effects,
because suddenly people were talking to me

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.771
and they were noticing me.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:42.935
And even though I was itching like crazy,

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.809
it was worth it to feel accepted.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:51.047
And so I couldn't wait to get a cold
so I could take my erythromycin.

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:58.422
But underneath that beautiful, glowing skin,
I still had that cold.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:02.529
Well, that's a meteor.

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.499
<i>The word is "Metaphor."</i>

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.695
<i>Can you really be that dumb?</i>

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.405
She's not dumb.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.903
Thank you, Natalie.

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:19.041
And, Mrs. Hagstrom, I meant "Meteor."

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:23.775
It flashes by and burns bright,
but then it disappears.

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:27.720
And that was what was happening to me.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:30.223
The real me just disappeared.

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:33.750
<i>Is anyone buying this?</i>

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.162
I am not an expert speech-giver.

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:42.229
But I do know that one day,
when your looks are gone,

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.898
if everything you have is based on looks,
well, then you've got nothing.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:49.205
You need your friends
and your family by your side,

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:53.077
to love you for who you are,
not what you look like.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:56.914
At the Zeta house, our new motto is,
"Be who you are."

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.919
Because we're a family.

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:03.354
We're a family that loves you on the inside.

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:09.758
So we need you to stand forward
and be a part of that family.

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:15.194
We need 30 people right now
to stand forward and pledge Zeta!

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:18.671
Hey, honey!
You had me at "itchy ass cheeks." I'm in.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.708
Me too! Me too!

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.072
Me too!

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:24.635
- I'll be a Zeta!
- Me, too!

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.509
- Me, too.
- I'll pledge!

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:30.142
- Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11!
- Me, too!

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:33.085
- I'll pledge!
- Twelve! Thirteen! Come on, we need 30.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.621
- I'll do it!
- Fourteen.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.919
- Get your hand down.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:39.960
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
Excellent! Twenty-one!

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.895
- Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Come on!
- I'll be in Zeta!

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.989
- Twenty-four, 25.
- Up here! Pick me!

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:47.193
Twenty-six, on top.
Thank you. Twenty-seven.

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.634
New pledger, right there.
Come on, two more!

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.296
Twenty-eight, 29!

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.602
One more. Just need one more.
Come on, everybody.

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:57.236
One more. One more. Get your hand up.
Come on! Be a Zeta.

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.609
Come on!

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.979
Come on! Come on, one more!
Just need one more Zeta.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.075
One more, one more. Come on!

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:06.552
Pound the gavel!
Why are you dragging this out?

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.020
There's nobody else! It's over.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha on you, Zetas.

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:14.827
Wait!

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:17.956
There's one more new Zeta!

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:28.775
No. Sorry.

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:32.945
Can't be a baby pledging a sorority.
You gotta be a student.

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.311
That's right!

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:37.476
Rules are rules. Oh, well. Bye-bye.

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.679
Time to pound that gavel.
Meeting adjourned.

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:42.587
Dunzo. Pound that gavel, Dean.

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.184
I'm really very sorry, girls.
I know how hard you've worked for this.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.229
It hurts me to do this, but I...

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.561
Stop! I would like to pledge Zeta.

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.394
What?

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:55.959
I like everything that Shelley said.

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:58.096
Are you out of your mind?

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.800
And, God, do you know
how sick to death I am of you?

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.937
Of Phi lota Mu?

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:08.448
I've been in Phi lota Mu hell!

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.507
I want to be a Zeta.

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.316
No!

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:23.694
Okay, so Zetas keep their house.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.460
Meeting adjourned.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.092
Now, go study something.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:35.242
What are we supposed to do now?

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.107
Let's start with this.

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.985
Oh, I love my weird home.

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.284
Things that I like!

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:52.053
Ottoman! Oh, I love you, ottoman.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.285
- This house is so nice!
- I know.

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.388
I mean, so cool.

01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:00.491
- Hey, do you want me to show you upstairs?
- Yes! Show me, show me, show me.

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.229
This is so great.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.897
Everything worked out so perfectly.

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.500
Well, not perfectly.

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:13.604
I mean, I messed up things with Oliver
because I moved to Peru and left him a note.

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.479
Well, Shelley,
you didn't really move to Peru.

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.781
I know that, but he doesn't.

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:22.520
Oliver.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:28.991
I was literally just talking about you.
How did you know that I got back?

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:32.693
Let's just say a little bird told me.

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.369
I gotta meet this frickin' bird!

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.230
It's me, Shell.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:42.976
I'm the bird. I called Oliver.

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.512
Thank you.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.982
It's so great to have such nice friends.

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:56.212
And, Oliver, I have to admit,
I never went to Peru.

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.554
- I know.
- Thank you.

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:00.218
You're welcome.

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.830
<i>And I was in Playboy.</i>

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.798
I know that, too. And I don't care.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.700
I would like to try this again.

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:14.231
Except this time,
no manhole covers or bubble gum.

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:18.273
You know, just see where this goes.

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:20.007
Yes.

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:23.214
- I'd like that.
- Great.

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:27.520
Oliver.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:28.885
Oliver.

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:32.921
- I'm Shelley.
- Nice to meet you again, Shelley.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:37.322
<i>Dear Hef, everything worked out!</i>

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:40.834
<i>We got 330 new Zeta sisters,
and the house was saved.</i>

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.905
<i>And Oliver and I started dating again.</i>

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.873
<i>Oliver is kind and sweet and when we kiss,</i>

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:50.570
<i>I see stars and he sees fireworks.</i>

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.909
<i>And he says that means that we're in love,
and he's right!</i>

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.413
<i>Because otherwise, when we kiss</i>

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:57.451
<i>we'd see stuff like pencils
and empty ketchup bottles.</i>

01:30:57.518 --> 01:31:00.976
<i>Oh, and the Zetas decided to throw
a big party in my honor,</i>

01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:03.182
<i>and I felt just like that girl
from the storybook.</i>

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.088
<i>You know the one. What's her name?</i>

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:07.320
<i>Oh, yeah. Cinderella.</i>

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:21.103
<i>Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?</i>

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:23.473
<i>Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?</i>

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.774
<i>Hands up now</i>

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:27.474
<i>Push it up now</i>

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.947
<i>I know what boys like</i>

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:33.213
<i>Cute smiles and heels high</i>

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.551
<i>I tempt the hello</i>

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.784
<i>While I say bye-bye</i>

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:40.089
<i>I know they want me</i>

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.424
<i>They try to fake it</i>

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.761
<i>But they just end up</i>

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:46.823
<i>Intimidated!</i>

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.269
<i>It ain't that hard to see</i>

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.240
<i>I know you're feelin' me</i>

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.037
<i>I know what I want</i>

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:58.374
<i>If I think you'll give me</i>

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.573
<i>I might let you</i>

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:03.014
<i>Unconditionally, yeah</i>

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.279
<i>I might let you</i>

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.548
<i>If you're on my level</i>

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.419
<i>I might let you</i>

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:12.186
<i>And, baby, if I think you're special</i>

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.251
<i>I might let you!</i>

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.489
<i>Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?</i>

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:19.055
<i>Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?</i>

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.328
<i>That's what they want, want</i>

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.393
<i>That's what they want, want</i>

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.965
<i>Now every time I come up in the spot
I'm with my Zetas</i>

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:32.342
<i>A peace sign to the fellas
And reverse it for the hatas</i>

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:34.643
<i>Slickity-slick Bam-boom-wow</i>

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:37.047
<i>Look at how hot my ladies are now</i>

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:39.313
<i>We ain't messin' with you fools</i>

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.912
<i>We ain't playin' with you clowns</i>

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.219
<i>Now this blonde babe is the one to thank</i>

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:46.624
<i>Helped us rise to the top of the social ranks</i>

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:48.787
<i>The lost little bunny
changed us for the better</i>

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:51.331
<i>Now she's part of the Zeta family forever</i>

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.663
<i>Back, back...
Back it on up</i>

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:56.066
<i>Back it a-back it a-back
Back it on up</i>

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:58.367
<i>Back, back...
Back it on up</i>

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.873
<i>Now I realize that</i>

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.240
<i>I know what boys like</i>

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.541
<i>I know what guys want</i>

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.843
