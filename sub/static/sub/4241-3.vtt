00:04.100 --> 00:04.100
That you missed on
Glee: Artie made the football

00:04.100 --> 00:05.310
<i>team, which is crazy,
and Finn's not the quarterback</i>

00:05.395 --> 00:06.928
<i>anymore, this new kid Sam is.
Can you believe it? Kurt's dad</i>

00:06.980 --> 00:08.564
<i>and Finn's mom are dating,
and are really happy together,</i>

00:08.615 --> 00:10.232
<i>which makes Finn and Kurt
sort of like brothers.</i>

00:10.300 --> 00:11.450
<i>They sure yell at each other
like brothers.</i>

00:11.534 --> 00:13.152
Why is it so hard
for you to understand?

00:13.236 --> 00:14.937
<i>Sue has a sister, Jean,
who she doesn't yell at at all.</i>

00:15.004 --> 00:16.321
I will always
love you.

00:16.389 --> 00:18.273
<i>Which sort of makes her
the only person</i>

00:18.324 --> 00:21.677
<i>Sue doesn't yell at. And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:21.744 --> 00:23.662
<i>FINN:
It all started a week ago.</i>

00:23.746 --> 00:25.964
<i>I was super hungry,
but my mom was gone,</i>

00:26.049 --> 00:27.949
<i>so I busted out
the George Foreman.</i>

00:28.001 --> 00:30.886
<i>It wasn't making the cool
grill marks it used to after</i>

00:30.954 --> 00:32.753
<i>I tried to use it
to dry my shoes,</i>

00:32.806 --> 00:34.273
<i>but when it comes
to grilled cheese,</i>

00:34.340 --> 00:35.607
<i>I'm not that fancy.</i>

00:35.675 --> 00:37.976
<i>And when I pulled
the sandwich out,</i>

00:38.061 --> 00:40.179
<i>I saw the face of God.</i>

00:40.263 --> 00:41.930
<i>Literally.</i>

00:41.981 --> 00:44.483
<i>I had made a Grilled Cheesus.</i>

00:47.770 --> 00:50.272
<i>I'm so hungry.
I'm not the most religious guy.</i>

00:50.340 --> 00:52.491
<i>I sort of worship Eric Clapton
and Ochocinco,</i>

00:52.575 --> 00:54.676
<i>but this was different, so,</i>

00:54.744 --> 00:58.030
<i>I decided to see what it felt
like to, you know, pray.</i>

00:58.097 --> 01:00.499
Dear Grilled Cheesus...

01:00.567 --> 01:02.117
First of all,
you're super delicious.

01:02.168 --> 01:03.485
Please, Grilled Cheesus,

01:03.536 --> 01:05.453
please let us win
our first football game.

01:05.504 --> 01:07.172
It would mean so much to Artie,

01:07.257 --> 01:09.641
and I think you kind of
owe it to him.

01:09.709 --> 01:12.494
I mean, you did sort of
screw him in the leg department.

01:12.545 --> 01:14.997
And in return, Cheesy Lord,

01:15.064 --> 01:17.749
I'll make sure we honor you
this week in Glee Club.

01:17.817 --> 01:20.719
(crowd roaring,
players grunting)

01:20.803 --> 01:22.003
(whistle blowing)

01:22.055 --> 01:23.188
(cheering)

01:26.526 --> 01:29.328
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

01:36.819 --> 01:38.987
Hey, Dad.
Hey, that's my boy.

01:39.038 --> 01:41.073
You forgot your breakfast.

01:41.157 --> 01:42.524
Suzanne Somers says that
skipping breakfast is suicide.

01:42.575 --> 01:44.293
What is this?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.411
It's an egg white wrap
on a sprouted wheat tortilla,

01:46.496 --> 01:47.829
half a grapefruit
and a green drink.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.164
Where's my usual breakfast?

01:49.232 --> 01:50.249
A Coke and two Slim Jims?

01:50.333 --> 01:51.583
Yeah. Breakfast of champions.

01:51.668 --> 01:53.034
Dad, you are not
a kid anymore.

01:53.086 --> 01:54.536
You have to start
taking care of yourself.

01:54.604 --> 01:55.837
Well, I guess with
enough hot sauce,

01:55.889 --> 01:57.806
this will  all
right. Thanks.

01:57.873 --> 02:00.041
Hey, don't forget,
Friday night dinner is 6:00

02:00.093 --> 02:01.560
instead of 7:00
this week.

02:01.644 --> 02:03.312
Carole and Finn are coming over,

02:03.379 --> 02:05.213
and she has to work
the night shift.

02:05.265 --> 02:06.932
I-I can't do this Friday.

02:07.016 --> 02:08.901
<i>It's Sing-along Sound of Music
at the El Royale theater.</i>

02:08.985 --> 02:10.102
It's a once-a-year event.

02:10.169 --> 02:12.020
And last week,
you had to camp out early

02:12.071 --> 02:14.356
<i>so you could be first in line
for those Grey's Anatomy DVDs.</i>

02:14.407 --> 02:15.691
Season six, Dad.

02:15.742 --> 02:17.559
Okay, those Friday night
dinners are a ritual

02:17.610 --> 02:19.745
in our family--
one your mom started.

02:19.829 --> 02:21.280
I know, but I'm a teenager.

02:21.364 --> 02:23.248
Friday nights
are kind of important to me.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.450
Why are you making me
feel guilty about this?

02:25.535 --> 02:27.119
I, of all people,
know how important

02:27.203 --> 02:28.754
the relationship is
between you and Carole.

02:28.838 --> 02:30.122
Those dinners are more
than important.

02:30.206 --> 02:32.407
They're sacred.
Okay, the whole point

02:32.475 --> 02:34.760
of having something sacred is
that it takes precedence

02:34.844 --> 02:36.878
over anything else
you got going on.

02:36.930 --> 02:38.413
<i>Sing-along Sound of Music
is sacred to me.</i>

02:38.481 --> 02:39.781
What? You think
I don't know that?

02:39.849 --> 02:41.383
Okay, wasn't I the one
who bought you

02:41.434 --> 02:42.684
that Maria bonnet
when you were six?

02:42.752 --> 02:44.052
Okay, the point is,

02:44.103 --> 02:46.421
if you start giving up stuff
like Friday night dinners,

02:46.472 --> 02:48.006
then you got nothing
to hold onto.

02:48.074 --> 02:49.358
Okay, let's face it, Kurt.

02:49.425 --> 02:51.443
If we don't schedule it,
then we don't hang out.

02:51.527 --> 02:53.111
If we don't hang out,
then our lives--

02:53.196 --> 02:54.479
they just go right by
each other.

02:54.564 --> 02:56.198
And we don't share very much.

02:56.265 --> 02:59.534
I'm sorry, but I'm not missing
something that I look forward to

02:59.602 --> 03:02.571
all year just for
another dinner.

03:02.622 --> 03:04.406
Maybe we could do it
Thursday or something.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.159
I got to tell you, Kurt.

03:07.243 --> 03:11.380
I'm real disappointed in you.

03:14.968 --> 03:16.251
(school bell ringing)

03:16.302 --> 03:18.053
Mr. Shue?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.338
I have something to say.

03:19.422 --> 03:21.122
Something happened to me,

03:21.174 --> 03:24.259
and I can't really get into it,
but it's shaken me to my core.

03:24.310 --> 03:25.143
Oh, my God, he's coming out.

03:25.228 --> 03:26.728
Why, yes,

03:26.796 --> 03:29.765
there is a man who's sort of
recently come into my life, and

03:29.832 --> 03:32.184
that man is Jesus Christ.

03:33.586 --> 03:34.903
That's way worse.

03:34.970 --> 03:35.771
And I know
there's others

03:35.822 --> 03:37.055
in here who dig him, too.

03:37.123 --> 03:39.091
And so I thought,
maybe this week,

03:39.158 --> 03:41.710
we could pay tribute
to him in music.

03:41.778 --> 03:44.780
You know, pay
tribute to Jesus.

03:44.831 --> 03:46.331
Sorry, uh,
but if I wanted to sing

03:46.416 --> 03:47.866
about Jesus, I'd go to church.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.951
And the reason I don't go
to church is because

03:50.003 --> 03:52.537
most churches don't think
very much of gay people.

03:52.622 --> 03:54.873
Or women. Or science.

03:54.957 --> 03:56.475
I don't see anything wrong
with getting a little church

03:56.542 --> 03:57.426
up in here.
I agree.

03:57.493 --> 03:58.710
I've had a really hard year,

03:58.778 --> 04:00.195
and I turned to God
a lot for help.

04:00.263 --> 04:02.447
I, for one, wouldn't mind
saying thanks.

04:02.515 --> 04:05.100
Thanks for what? That it
didn't come out a lizard baby?

04:05.167 --> 04:06.668
Whenever I pray, I fall asleep.

04:06.719 --> 04:07.969
Well, guys,
maybe our song selections

04:08.021 --> 04:09.438
don't have to be about Jesus.

04:09.505 --> 04:11.857
We could do songs
about spirituality.

04:12.975 --> 04:14.309
You got a problem with Jesus?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.811
Oh, I got no problem
with the guy.

04:15.862 --> 04:16.978
I'm a total Jew for Jesus.

04:17.029 --> 04:18.279
He's my number one Heb.

04:18.348 --> 04:20.599
What I don't like seeing
is people using J-money

04:20.666 --> 04:22.951
to cramp everybody
else's style, 'cause it seems

04:23.019 --> 04:25.620
to me that true spirituality
or whatever you want to call it

04:25.688 --> 04:27.539
is about enjoying the life
that you've been given.

04:27.607 --> 04:29.958
I mean, I see God every time
I make out with a new chick.

04:30.026 --> 04:31.309
RACHEL: Okay, okay,
that doesn't make

04:31.377 --> 04:33.245
any sense.
In fact, it's stupid.

04:33.312 --> 04:36.081
Are you calling
Mr. Billy Joel stupid?

04:36.165 --> 04:38.250
At this time, I'd like
to continue my streak

04:38.334 --> 04:39.868
of doing only songs
by Jewish artists.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.422
Hit it.

Oh.

06:19.902 --> 06:21.536
Hey, you okay, man?

06:21.587 --> 06:23.588
Yeah, just a little
indigestion, you know.

06:23.673 --> 06:26.208
Don't buy salami
at the gas station.

(speaking French)

06:53.786 --> 06:56.238
Kurt?

06:56.305 --> 06:57.739
Can we talk to you outside?

07:06.448 --> 07:08.333
Where is he?

07:08.417 --> 07:10.085
Is he dead?

07:10.136 --> 07:11.469
No, he's alive, but I'm sorry

07:11.554 --> 07:13.071
I don't have
any other good news.

07:13.139 --> 07:14.923
I want to see him.
He hasn't regained
consciousness.

07:14.974 --> 07:16.007
WILL:
I thought he had
a heart attack.

07:16.092 --> 07:17.259
Brought on by an arrhythmia,

07:17.310 --> 07:18.844
which caused a lack
of blood to his brain.

07:18.928 --> 07:19.845
That's what made him
lose consciousness

07:19.929 --> 07:21.012
and what's keeping him comatose.

07:21.097 --> 07:22.430
We have him on lidocaine,

07:22.481 --> 07:24.933
but there's no guarantees
they're going to work

07:24.984 --> 07:26.401
or what kind of damage was done

07:26.468 --> 07:28.019
to his brain
by the lack of oxygen.

07:28.104 --> 07:29.571
I don't understand
what you're saying.

07:29.638 --> 07:31.306
When is he going
to wake up?

07:31.357 --> 07:32.807
I don't know.

07:32.875 --> 07:36.578
Okay, just-just...
just take us to him now, please.

07:38.281 --> 07:40.949
(monitor beeping)

07:50.176 --> 07:52.027
I need a minute.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.047
I don't think you
should be alone, Kurt.

07:56.132 --> 07:58.600
Please just give me a moment
alone with my father.

08:01.837 --> 08:05.206
We'll be right outside.

08:16.886 --> 08:18.954
Dad?

08:23.692 --> 08:25.543
Can you hear me?

08:27.129 --> 08:29.514
If you can hear me,

08:29.582 --> 08:31.433
squeeze my hand.

08:34.754 --> 08:36.671
I'm holding yours right now.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.227
Just squee back.

08:42.311 --> 08:44.896
Come on, Dad.

08:44.981 --> 08:47.482
<i>Just squeeze my nd.</i>

08:52.403 --> 08:54.305
<i>What up, Grilled Cheesus?</i>

08:54.372 --> 08:56.540
<i>I need to ask you
for something.</i>

08:56.591 --> 08:58.159
I didn't go to Sunday school
so I don't know

08:58.226 --> 09:00.544
if God works the same as a genie
and I only get three wishes,

09:00.595 --> 09:01.946
but here's the thing.

09:02.013 --> 09:03.914
Dating Rachel is great,

09:03.965 --> 09:06.967
but she's kind of a prude,
and I'm sort of going crazy.

09:07.035 --> 09:08.719
Anyway, her boobs
aren't that great,

09:08.770 --> 09:10.688
but they're still girl boobs,

09:10.755 --> 09:12.456
and I'd really like
to touch them.

09:12.524 --> 09:14.258
So, Cheesus,

09:14.326 --> 09:15.926
considering
that I've dedicated a week

09:15.977 --> 09:18.212
of my musical life to you,

09:18.280 --> 09:20.564
I hope you can see it
in your heart

09:20.615 --> 09:22.233
to answer my prayers.

09:24.419 --> 09:26.287
Amen.

09:26.354 --> 09:27.922
(school bell ringing)

09:40.118 --> 09:41.802
SANTANA:
Hey, Kurt.

09:41.887 --> 09:44.255
We're really sorry
about your dad's heart attack.

09:44.306 --> 09:46.056
Thanks, Santana.

09:46.124 --> 09:47.758
I did a book report
on heart attacks,

09:47.809 --> 09:49.626
if you want to give it
to the doctor.

09:49.678 --> 09:51.312
I got knocked down
an entire letter grade

09:51.396 --> 09:52.963
'cause it was written
in crayon.

09:53.014 --> 09:55.899
What the hell happened?

09:55.951 --> 09:57.418
My dad's in the hospital.
I know.

09:57.502 --> 09:59.837
My mom just called me. I feel
like I'm the last one to know!

09:59.904 --> 10:01.505
Well, I'm sorry, Finn.
It didn't occur to me

10:01.573 --> 10:02.923
to call you, because
he's not your father.

10:03.008 --> 10:04.408
Yeah, well, he's the closest
I'm ever going to get, okay?

10:04.459 --> 10:07.795
I know it may not look like
what everybody else has,

10:07.879 --> 10:09.980
but I thought we were...
sort of a family.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.851
Look, I-I guess I just...

10:13.918 --> 10:15.252
I didn't like overhearing

10:15.303 --> 10:17.154
other people talking about it
in gym class.

10:25.447 --> 10:26.564
Hey, guys.

10:26.615 --> 10:29.766
Our thoughts are all
with Kurt, and, uh,

10:29.818 --> 10:31.785
I know it's sort of hard to
really focus on anything else...

10:31.870 --> 10:32.903
MERCEDES:
Mr. Shue

10:32.971 --> 10:34.188
Yeah.
I've been struggling, trying

10:34.256 --> 10:36.006
to figure out
what I wanted to say to Kurt

10:36.074 --> 10:38.075
all day,
and I realize

10:38.143 --> 10:39.409
I don't want to say it,
I want to sing it.

10:41.096 --> 10:44.715
This song is about
being in a very dark place,

10:44.766 --> 10:45.799
and turning to God.

10:45.884 --> 10:47.801
It's a spiritual song,
Mr. Shue.

10:47.869 --> 10:49.586
Is that okay?
It's fine.

10:51.056 --> 10:53.474
Tina, Quinn, can you
help me out, please?

Thank you,

12:37.295 --> 12:38.629
Mercedes.

12:38.696 --> 12:40.631
Your voice is stunning, but...

12:40.698 --> 12:42.199
I don't believe in God.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.751
Wait, what?

12:43.818 --> 12:45.002
You've all professed
your beliefs.

12:45.053 --> 12:46.420
I'm just stating mine.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.256
I think God is kind of like
Santa Claus for adults.

12:49.340 --> 12:50.373
Otherwise,

12:50.425 --> 12:52.026
God's kind of a jerk,

12:52.093 --> 12:53.210
isn't he?

12:53.261 --> 12:55.378
I mean, he makes
me gay and then

12:55.430 --> 12:57.848
has his followers going
around telling me it's
something that I chose.

12:57.899 --> 12:59.600
<i>As if someone would
choose to be mocked</i>

12:59.684 --> 13:01.151
every single day of their life.

13:01.219 --> 13:02.719
And right now

13:02.771 --> 13:04.521
I don't want a heavenly father.

13:04.572 --> 13:06.006
I want my real one back.

13:06.074 --> 13:08.158
But Kurt, how
do you know for sure?

13:08.226 --> 13:10.277
I mean, you can't prove
that there's no God.

13:10.361 --> 13:12.246
<i>You can't prove that there
isn't a magic teapot</i>

13:12.330 --> 13:14.248
floating around
on the dark side of the moon

13:14.315 --> 13:15.783
with a dwarf inside of it

13:15.867 --> 13:18.285
that reads romance novels
and shoots lightning

13:18.369 --> 13:21.955
out of its boobs, but it seems
pretty unlikely, doesn't it?

13:22.040 --> 13:24.091
Is God an evil dwarf?

13:24.159 --> 13:25.909
We shouldn't be
talking like this.

13:25.977 --> 13:27.044
It's not right.

13:27.095 --> 13:29.246
I'm sorry, Quinn.

13:29.297 --> 13:32.049
But you all can believe
whatever you want to.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.234
But I can't believe
something I don't.

13:34.302 --> 13:36.520
I appreciate your thoughts...

13:36.587 --> 13:39.422
but I don't want your prayers.

13:41.425 --> 13:43.560
<i>WILL:
How did you even find out
about the lesson?</i>

13:43.628 --> 13:45.612
I have cameras
everywhere, William.

13:45.697 --> 13:47.597
I'm ving a lesson
on spirituality.

13:47.649 --> 13:49.316
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

13:49.384 --> 13:51.452
Well, the big deal is
that this is a public school,

13:51.536 --> 13:52.703
and there's this little thing

13:52.770 --> 13:53.821
called separation
of church and state,

13:53.888 --> 13:55.155
<i>which happens
to be the pillar</i>

13:55.240 --> 13:56.606
of a functioning
civil society.

13:56.658 --> 13:57.958
But Sue,
children should be

13:58.042 --> 14:00.544
allowed to profess
whatever faith they choose.

14:00.611 --> 14:03.213
At the BET Awards,
but not in a public school.

14:03.281 --> 14:04.631
Sue, I'm trying
to help these kids.

14:04.716 --> 14:06.750
Kurt is struggling with
some really tough issues.

14:06.818 --> 14:09.503
Well, William, if your kids want
to praise Jesus in class,

14:09.587 --> 14:12.455
I suggest they enroll at Sweet
Holy Mother of God Academy

14:12.507 --> 14:13.507
on I Love Jesus Street,

14:13.591 --> 14:14.758
but not here.

14:14.826 --> 14:16.459
This country is
not a monarchy, William.

14:16.511 --> 14:17.811
Trust me, I've tried.

14:17.896 --> 14:20.514
And as much as I enjoy
giving impromptu civics lessons,

14:20.598 --> 14:21.865
I got work to do.

14:28.556 --> 14:30.807
Finn, please... sit.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.948
You're upset about
Kurt's dad, too?

14:38.016 --> 14:39.650
Yes.

14:39.717 --> 14:42.069
But more importantly,
let's discuss

14:42.137 --> 14:44.688
your newfound love for Jesus
and how it's affecting me.

14:44.756 --> 14:47.657
I want this
relationship

14:47.709 --> 14:49.059
to go the distance,

14:49.127 --> 14:51.712
but I need to know that
when I'm 25 and I've won

14:51.779 --> 14:53.096
a bunch of Tonys,
and I'm ready

14:53.164 --> 14:54.898
to have intercourse and babies,
that those babies will

14:54.966 --> 14:56.666
be raised in
a certain way.
You don't think

14:56.718 --> 14:58.068
you're gonna have sex
till you're 25?

14:58.136 --> 15:00.170
I want my children to be raised
in the Jewish faith.

15:00.238 --> 15:01.889
Both of my dads' peoples
were slaves once.

15:01.973 --> 15:04.608
I need to know that my children
will be free to worship

15:04.675 --> 15:06.226
<i>in the way that
I decide is right.</i>

15:06.311 --> 15:08.645
Sure. Of course.

15:08.713 --> 15:10.998
Yeah, they should totally
go to Jew church and...

15:11.065 --> 15:12.599
and wear those hats and...

15:12.667 --> 15:14.885
and eat that salty orange
stuff with their bagels.

15:21.192 --> 15:23.293
Let's lay down on the bed.

15:23.361 --> 15:24.411
Okay.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.884
(whispers):
Finn...

15:30.969 --> 15:32.753
I'd like to give you something

15:32.820 --> 15:35.472
in exchange
for what you gave me.

15:40.094 --> 15:41.878
♪ ♪

15:51.072 --> 15:53.273
(whispers):
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

15:53.358 --> 15:55.826
I need to know what's going on
with that Glee Club.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.560
Brittany, Jugs the Clown, go.

15:57.612 --> 15:59.062
Mostly just everyone's
really sad

15:59.130 --> 16:01.198
for Kurt, and no one
really knows how to help.

16:01.249 --> 16:03.033
I made him a card
that said "Heart attacks

16:03.084 --> 16:04.434
are just from
loving too much."

16:04.502 --> 16:05.619
Schuester's
still pushing

16:05.687 --> 16:07.754
the Lil' Jeezy?
I guess so.

16:07.822 --> 16:10.374
Although I don't really see
what the big deal is.

16:10.425 --> 16:11.925
But Kurt's
definitely not into it.

16:11.993 --> 16:14.428
How's your father?

16:14.512 --> 16:16.746
They say his condition
is critical

16:16.798 --> 16:17.848
but stable.

16:17.915 --> 16:19.099
Good news, I guess.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.717
I'm sorry for what you're
going through, Lady.

16:20.768 --> 16:22.319
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

16:22.387 --> 16:24.805
And I guess I don't have to--
I think Mary Lou Retton's,

16:24.889 --> 16:26.440
like, an orphan or something.

16:26.524 --> 16:27.975
I don't like

16:28.042 --> 16:29.643
what Schuester's doing
in that classroom

16:29.727 --> 16:30.894
even more than usual.

16:30.945 --> 16:32.929
But I can't go
to the school board

16:32.981 --> 16:34.715
without an official complaint
from a student.

16:36.034 --> 16:38.485
So you want me
to be your scapegoat?

16:38.553 --> 16:40.804
(quietly): No.

16:40.871 --> 16:42.556
You don't understand.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.260
I know at times I mess around
with you guys for fun.

16:46.344 --> 16:48.044
I admit it--
it aids digestion.

16:48.096 --> 16:51.047
But I'm not joking here.

16:53.468 --> 16:56.069
I want to be your champion.

17:01.214 --> 17:02.247
What is wrong with you?

17:02.332 --> 17:03.315
I'm sorry, Madame Secretary,

17:03.383 --> 17:04.967
I'm gonna have to call you back.

17:05.034 --> 17:06.335
Love to Bill.

17:06.402 --> 17:08.587
There is a boy
in that Glee Club

17:08.671 --> 17:10.222
that might
lose his father.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.207
How could you get in the way
when the only thing

17:12.258 --> 17:14.510
anybody is trying to do
is give that poor child

17:14.560 --> 17:15.877
just a little bit of comfort?

17:15.929 --> 17:17.146
What happened

17:17.213 --> 17:18.396
to you, Sue?

17:18.481 --> 17:20.065
Please tell me
what horrible, horrible thing

17:20.150 --> 17:22.351
happened to you that made you
such a miserable tyrant?

17:22.402 --> 17:23.602
Have a seat.

17:25.021 --> 17:26.855
Since I was
a little girl,

17:26.906 --> 17:28.107
I've had exactly

17:28.191 --> 17:30.442
one hero.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.111
My big sister.

17:32.195 --> 17:34.196
You know how much
I worshipped her?

17:34.247 --> 17:38.000
She was the sun
and the moon to me.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.502
And while I was
still very young,

17:40.570 --> 17:43.372
I noticed that other people
didn't feel the way I did.

17:43.423 --> 17:45.207
People were rude to her.

17:45.258 --> 17:47.292
They were cruel.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.178
They laughed at her.

17:49.245 --> 17:51.430
And so I began to pray.

17:51.514 --> 17:53.782
I prayed every night
for her to get better.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.001
And nothing changed.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.605
So I prayed harder.

18:01.808 --> 18:05.144
And after a while I realized
it wasn't that I wasn't praying

18:05.228 --> 18:07.095
hard enough...

18:07.147 --> 18:08.981
it's that no one was listening.

18:10.967 --> 18:15.154
Asking someone to believe
in a fantasy...

18:15.238 --> 18:18.607
however comforting,
isn't a moral thing to do.

18:18.675 --> 18:20.125
It's cruel.

18:20.193 --> 18:23.412
Don't you think that's
just a little bit arrogant?

18:23.463 --> 18:25.714
It's as arrogant as telling
someone how to believe in God,

18:25.781 --> 18:28.383
and if they don't accept it,
no matter how openhearted

18:28.451 --> 18:32.237
or honest their dissent,
they're going to hell.

18:32.305 --> 18:34.306
Well, that doesn't sound
very Christian, does it?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.725
Well, if that's what
you believe, that's fine.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.477
But please keep it to yourself.

18:38.561 --> 18:40.562
So long as you do the same.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.148
That kid could lose
his father at any moment.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.167
You should start
preparing him for that.

18:45.235 --> 18:47.135
Now get the hell
out of my office.

18:47.187 --> 18:49.354
I realize you're only
half orangutan,

18:49.439 --> 18:53.192
but I'm still very allergi
to your lustrous ginger mane.

18:56.362 --> 18:59.081
Last week we were too sexy,
this week we're too religious--

18:59.148 --> 19:01.166
we can't win.
Now I know what
Miley feels like.

19:01.251 --> 19:02.817
The real tragedy here
is that I found

19:02.869 --> 19:04.703
the most perfect spiritual song
to sing this week,

19:04.787 --> 19:07.005
and now it's been torn away
from me like Sophie's daughter.

19:07.090 --> 19:09.208
Guys, you can still sing
whatever songs you like

19:09.292 --> 19:11.460
that sum up your feelings
about God, about spirit.

19:11.527 --> 19:12.928
You just can't do
it on school time.

19:12.996 --> 19:14.379
I hope you're happy, Kurt.

19:14.464 --> 19:16.181
Having the week of
my life, actually.

19:16.266 --> 19:19.017
Guys... back off Kurt, okay?

19:19.085 --> 19:21.136
He had every right
to speak his mind.

19:21.187 --> 19:23.472
Look, Kurt, we're sympathetic
to what you're going through,

19:23.523 --> 19:26.174
but siding with Miss Sylvester
isn't gonna do anyone any good.

19:26.226 --> 19:27.359
It's doing me
some good.

19:27.443 --> 19:28.977
Now I don't have
to sit around

19:29.028 --> 19:30.646
listening to all
you mental patients

19:30.697 --> 19:34.733
talk about how's there's a God
when I know there isn't one.

19:34.817 --> 19:36.818
(school bell rings)

19:36.869 --> 19:39.404
Cheesus, I don't need
to tell you how much you rule.

19:39.489 --> 19:41.690
You've given me everything
I've prayed for,

19:41.741 --> 19:44.243
and it turns out Rachel's boobs
are really awesome.

19:44.327 --> 19:47.129
Anyway, I need another favor,
so, Cheesus...

19:47.196 --> 19:49.665
I pray that I'm
made quarterback again.

19:49.732 --> 19:52.084
Sam's a good dude--
I just think that I can deliver

19:52.151 --> 19:53.652
your message to the world
more powerfully

19:53.736 --> 19:55.787
if I'm the most popular guy
in the school again.

19:55.855 --> 19:56.972
PUCK:
What are you doing?

19:57.023 --> 19:58.106
Nothing. Eating.

19:59.742 --> 20:03.111
So I pray before I eat now--
what's the big deal?

20:03.162 --> 20:04.830
You're not gonna tell anybody
about this, are you?

20:04.914 --> 20:06.481
No. It's cool.

20:06.532 --> 20:07.916
To tell you the truth,

20:07.984 --> 20:10.502
I actually went to temple
with my nanny yesterday.

20:10.586 --> 20:13.939
I know it makes me a wuss,
but I'm bummed about Kurt's dad.

20:14.007 --> 20:15.707
I've kind of been
praying for him.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.125
I know how
hard it is

20:17.176 --> 20:19.995
not to have a
father, you know?

20:20.046 --> 20:21.430
What do you pray for?

20:21.497 --> 20:22.814
Yeah. Same stuff.

20:22.882 --> 20:25.300
You burned your grilled cheese.

20:30.523 --> 20:32.240
(slaps arm, winces)

20:32.308 --> 20:34.159
Why are we in the park?
'Cause I don't

20:34.227 --> 20:36.328
want anything coming
between us and God.

20:36.396 --> 20:37.663
And because Yentl
was outside when

20:37.747 --> 20:39.414
she sang this
song in the movie.

20:39.482 --> 20:43.035
I just hope that God
hears this song as
a prayer for Burt Hummel

20:43.119 --> 20:45.787
and decides to bring
him back to us.

What's going on in here?

24:17.166 --> 24:19.467
We-We were just praying
for your dad.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.703
MERCEDES: Rachel, Quinn, and I
are taking turns.

24:21.771 --> 24:23.622
We're from different
denominations and religions,

24:23.689 --> 24:25.507
so we figured one of us
is bound to be right.

24:25.575 --> 24:27.792
I didn't ask you to do this.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.245
Honey, I know you're upset about
what's happening, I get it,

24:30.313 --> 24:33.164
but friends help out,
even when you don't ask.

24:33.232 --> 24:35.467
Mr. Kurt Hummel?

24:35.535 --> 24:37.402
Dude, why didn't you just tell
us you wanted to pray in Muslim?

24:37.470 --> 24:40.171
I'm not Muslim, I'm a Sikh.

24:40.239 --> 24:42.157
She's going to see
if acupuncture will improve

24:42.224 --> 24:44.993
the circulation
to my dad's brain.

24:45.060 --> 24:48.947
Amazingly, needles pierce
the skin better than psalms.

24:49.031 --> 24:50.582
Can you all please leave now?

24:54.420 --> 24:56.121
We just wanted
to do something.

25:10.415 --> 25:11.415
SAM:
Red 42 on three.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.349
ALL:
Break.

25:12.417 --> 25:15.252
Wait.

25:15.303 --> 25:17.137
That cornerback's been cheating
right all night.

25:17.222 --> 25:18.422
We should naked bootleg left.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.723
That ogre linebacker's
on the left.

25:19.774 --> 25:20.941
He's been killing me all game.

25:21.026 --> 25:22.476
Dude, trust me, I'm the only guy

25:22.560 --> 25:24.278
who's ever actually won
a game on this field.

25:24.362 --> 25:25.595
(laughter)

25:25.647 --> 25:30.600
Okay, naked bootleg left,
I keep on three.

25:30.652 --> 25:31.768
All right,
you ready?
ALL:
Break.

25:33.571 --> 25:35.406
That's not what I called.

25:37.075 --> 25:38.542
Yah! Hike!

25:38.609 --> 25:40.044
(grunting)

25:50.555 --> 25:51.955
Is he okay?
His shoulder's
dislocated.

25:52.007 --> 25:53.123
This is
what happens

25:53.174 --> 25:54.975
when you change my plays
in the huddle.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.927
SAM:
I don't understand, that
guy came out of nowhere.

25:56.995 --> 25:58.946
BEISTE:
I know, that kid's been
cheating right all night.

25:59.014 --> 26:00.147
No reason for
him to be there.

26:00.231 --> 26:01.631
It's just bad luck.

26:01.683 --> 26:04.518
We need to get him
to the E.R.
Okay, let's go.

26:04.602 --> 26:06.303
It's in your
hands now, Lurch.

26:06.354 --> 26:08.305
Congratulations, you're
the quarterback again.

26:15.146 --> 26:16.447
I know things have been
pretty morose

26:16.498 --> 26:17.915
around here this past week,

26:17.982 --> 26:19.483
but I want to celebrate
some good news

26:19.551 --> 26:20.918
for our little family.

26:20.985 --> 26:22.286
Let's hear it for Finn
on getting back

26:22.337 --> 26:23.737
his quarterback job

26:23.805 --> 26:25.289
and leading the Titans to a win

26:25.340 --> 26:26.674
in their second game
of the season.

26:26.758 --> 26:28.959
(applause)

26:29.010 --> 26:30.627
Yeah, too bad that Sam kid
had to have his arm

26:30.679 --> 26:32.796
basically ripped off for it
to happen, but it's good

26:32.864 --> 26:33.931
to have you back
in the saddle, brother.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.218
Mr. Shue, if I may?

26:38.303 --> 26:39.803
Yeah.

26:39.854 --> 26:43.474
Um, I wanted to thank everyone
for your kind e-mails

26:43.525 --> 26:45.609
and queries
about my dad,

26:45.676 --> 26:49.263
but for your information, his
condition mains the same.

26:51.182 --> 26:54.485
I need to express myself,
so with your permission,

26:54.536 --> 26:57.287
Mr. Shue, I've prepared
a number for the occasion.

26:57.355 --> 26:59.356
WILL:
Of course, Kurt.

26:59.407 --> 27:01.959
On the day of my mom's funeral,

27:02.026 --> 27:06.947
when they were lowering her body
into the ground, I was crying.

27:07.015 --> 27:08.966
I mean,
that was it.

27:09.033 --> 27:12.052
It was the last time
I was ever going to see her,

27:12.137 --> 27:13.971
and I remember
I looked up at my dad

27:14.038 --> 27:17.591
and I, I just wanted him
to say something,

27:17.675 --> 27:22.646
just something to make me feel
like my whole world wasn't over,

27:22.714 --> 27:26.183
and he just took my hand
and squeezed it.

27:28.186 --> 27:30.721
And just knowing
that those hands were there

27:30.789 --> 27:35.125
to take care of me...
that was enough.

Kurt, can I talk
to you for a second?

30:14.852 --> 30:17.354
I know you're going through a
really scary time right now,

30:17.422 --> 30:21.174
but I feel like I don't know
how to be around you anymore,

30:21.259 --> 30:24.595
and I know you're not really
spiritual or whatever,

30:24.662 --> 30:26.897
but I feel like you're
closing yourself to a world

30:26.965 --> 30:28.465
of experiences that
might surprise you.

30:30.652 --> 30:33.437
You're right.

30:33.488 --> 30:34.521
I'm sorry.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.641
I shouldn't be pushing
my friends away,

30:37.709 --> 30:40.810
especially friends
as fabulous as you.

30:41.996 --> 30:45.565
Do me a favor-- one thing.

30:45.633 --> 30:47.901
Come to church with
me this Sunday.

30:47.969 --> 30:49.136
Our church does
this thing

30:49.203 --> 30:51.204
where we dedicate the
service to someone,

30:51.289 --> 30:54.741
and I got them to dedicate
this Sunday to your dad.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.927
I don't know.
You get to wear

30:56.995 --> 30:58.161
a fabulous hat.

31:01.382 --> 31:04.551
Mercedes, you had me
at "fabulous hat."

31:04.636 --> 31:05.552
(laughs)

31:05.637 --> 31:06.887
Come on, let's go to class.

31:06.971 --> 31:08.855
<i>(school bell ringing)</i>

31:12.447 --> 31:13.897
I have to confess something.

31:13.949 --> 31:15.866
I'm the reason Sam got hurt.

31:15.934 --> 31:17.651
I asked for three
things to happen--

31:17.719 --> 31:20.120
one, for us to win our
first football game,

31:20.205 --> 31:22.239
two, to get to second base
with Rachel, and three,

31:22.290 --> 31:24.291
to be the quarterback on
the football team again.

31:24.376 --> 31:26.510
All those three things happened
because I prayed for them

31:26.577 --> 31:28.429
to Grilled Cheesus.

31:29.598 --> 31:31.999
Okay.

31:32.067 --> 31:34.852
Where to start?
No, no, I know it sounds
crazy, but it isn't.

31:34.919 --> 31:36.470
Jesus appeared to
me on a sandwich

31:36.554 --> 31:38.472
and it has special
powers, I'm telling you,

31:38.540 --> 31:40.140
but I didn't mean for
anybody to get hurt.

31:40.225 --> 31:42.192
Okay, let's just--
let's take a second.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.978
Okay?
Um...

31:44.062 --> 31:47.531
look, first, you won
the football game

31:47.599 --> 31:48.816
because you actually
have a coach

31:48.900 --> 31:50.317
who spends the game
watching the plays

31:50.402 --> 31:51.652
rather than biting
his toenails.

31:51.736 --> 31:55.823
And God didn't let you
touch Rachel's boobs.

31:55.890 --> 31:57.291
Rachel did.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.710
Just the sides of them, but
wait, why would she do that?

31:59.777 --> 32:02.079
Well, what were you
doing right before you
were touching them?

32:02.130 --> 32:04.448
What?
I remember yawning.

32:04.516 --> 32:06.950
Right, 'cause we were talking
about emotional stuff.

32:07.002 --> 32:09.219
Oh, yes, well,
there you go, that's it.

32:09.287 --> 32:10.620
Girls like that.

32:10.672 --> 32:13.290
She felt close to you, thus
the inappropriate touching.

32:13.341 --> 32:17.294
Uh, more importantly,
you didn't hurt Sam.

32:17.345 --> 32:19.697
It was a 300-pound left tackle
who just got expelled

32:19.748 --> 32:23.534
because he's on steroids
and he's 23.

32:23.585 --> 32:27.054
God works in all kinds
of mysterious ways,

32:27.122 --> 32:29.840
but I'm pretty sure
he doesn't spend a lot of time

32:29.907 --> 32:33.577
trying to speak to us
through sandwiches.

32:34.696 --> 32:36.847
You look disappointed.

32:36.915 --> 32:38.966
I am.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.250
It was sort of cool

32:40.318 --> 32:43.637
feeling like I had this
direct line to God.

32:43.722 --> 32:44.938
Now I just feel

32:45.023 --> 32:47.858
like everybody
else, you know,

32:47.925 --> 32:51.595
like we're all just
floating around in space.

32:51.646 --> 32:52.613
I don't like that.

32:52.697 --> 32:54.031
You're not alone.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.984
The big questions are
really big for a reason--

32:57.068 --> 32:59.136
they're hard.

32:59.204 --> 33:00.270
But you know what?

33:00.338 --> 33:02.856
Absolutely everybody
struggles with them.

I thought we couldn't

34:43.174 --> 34:45.058
Evidently,
we can't sing about faith,

34:45.143 --> 34:47.094
but we can sing
about losing faith?

34:47.178 --> 34:49.263
That's sort of what I
want to talk about today.

34:49.347 --> 34:50.931
Well, earlier in the week, Finn,

34:51.014 --> 34:52.850
it seemed like
you felt differently.

34:52.917 --> 34:56.235
Well, I used to think God was
up there looking over me.

34:56.321 --> 34:58.272
Now, I'm not so sure.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.494
(organ plays)

35:03.561 --> 35:05.445
I'm very impressed
with everyone's Sunday best.

35:05.530 --> 35:09.082
It's so Christ-chic.

35:09.167 --> 35:11.285
I hope our genuflection
to the great

35:11.369 --> 35:13.420
Spaghetti Monster in the sky
don't take too long.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.539
My Sikh is coming
again today at 2:00

35:15.590 --> 35:17.591
to do more acupuncture
on my dad.

35:17.675 --> 35:19.009
Is it working?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.460
Not yet.

35:20.545 --> 35:22.596
Nothing is.

35:27.852 --> 35:30.103
I have to go be
with my choir.

35:31.523 --> 35:33.273
(mutters): Wait,
don't, don't...

35:35.727 --> 35:36.927
Hi, church.

35:36.978 --> 35:38.261
ALL:
Hi.

35:38.313 --> 35:40.063
I have a favor
to ask you guys.

35:40.114 --> 35:42.449
My friend Kurt Hummel's dad is
in the hospital.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.701
And it's pretty bad.

35:44.769 --> 35:47.938
And I know we have all of
our own worries and troubles,

35:47.989 --> 35:49.656
but if we could just
put them aside

35:49.724 --> 35:52.125
and focus all of our prayers
and give them to Burt Hummel,

35:52.210 --> 35:54.444
and to my friend Kurt.

35:54.495 --> 35:58.715
I know you don't believe in God,
and you don't believe

35:58.783 --> 36:00.500
in the power of prayer,
and that's okay.

36:00.585 --> 36:01.835
To each his own.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.337
But you've got to believe

36:03.421 --> 36:04.888
in something.

36:04.956 --> 36:07.758
Something more than you can
touch, taste or see.

36:07.809 --> 36:10.260
'Cause life is too hard
to go through it alone,

36:10.328 --> 36:11.929
without something to hold onto

36:11.996 --> 36:14.448
and without something
that's sacred.

Anyway, Kurt,

Yeah.

38:30.847 --> 38:32.314
Boom. Boom. I won!

38:32.381 --> 38:33.965
Oh!
Sue, you're letting me win.

38:34.033 --> 38:35.984
No, I swear it. I'm not!

38:36.068 --> 38:37.686
You're letting me win, Sue.

38:39.021 --> 38:40.922
You're letting me win.

38:40.990 --> 38:44.493
Do you believe in God, Jeannie?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.644
Do you?

38:46.696 --> 38:48.980
No, I don't.

38:49.031 --> 38:50.115
Why not?

38:50.183 --> 38:52.200
Because
when we were little girls,

38:52.285 --> 38:55.036
you were perfect in my eyes...

38:56.806 --> 38:59.641
And I watched the world
be cruel to you, so...

38:59.709 --> 39:01.743
God never makes mistakes.

39:03.212 --> 39:05.013
That's what I believe.

39:08.351 --> 39:09.634
You want me
to pray for you, Sue?

39:09.702 --> 39:12.337
Yeah. That would be nice.

39:17.276 --> 39:18.843
I win.

39:20.963 --> 39:22.948
I cheated.
I can't do that.

You never could
dress yourself.

39:32.708 --> 39:35.243
Mercedes took me to
church on Sunday.

39:37.079 --> 39:39.180
It's funny, but when
the choir was singing,

39:39.248 --> 39:42.384
this memory flashed
into my head.

39:42.451 --> 39:46.805
Do you remember our first Friday
night dinner after Mom died?

39:46.872 --> 39:48.807
You tried to
make a chicken.

39:48.874 --> 39:50.976
I guess you
wanted me to feel

39:51.043 --> 39:52.811
like there was
something still normal.

39:56.215 --> 39:58.650
You put it on the table,

39:58.717 --> 40:03.772
and you cut into
it, and it was raw.

40:03.856 --> 40:06.608
(laughs) And we both looked at
each other for a second,

40:06.676 --> 40:08.743
and cracked up
before we remembered

40:08.811 --> 40:11.296
that we weren't
supposed to yet.

40:15.668 --> 40:18.486
I'm sorry about the
other day, Dad.

40:18.554 --> 40:20.855
I should have let those
guys pray for you.

40:20.923 --> 40:23.341
It wasn't about me.

40:23.409 --> 40:27.295
It was about you,
and... it was nice.

40:27.363 --> 40:29.731
(monitor beeping)

40:33.202 --> 40:35.086
I don't believe in God, Dad.

40:37.790 --> 40:40.125
But I believe in you.

40:43.946 --> 40:45.780
And I believe in us.

40:48.284 --> 40:50.685
You and me--

40:50.753 --> 40:53.071
that's what's sacred to me.

40:56.108 --> 40:58.076
And I am...

41:03.332 --> 41:06.668
I'm so sorry that I never
got to tell you that.

41:10.122 --> 41:11.990
