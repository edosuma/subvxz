HANG ON!

18:20.367 --> 18:22.469
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK WE'RE DOING?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.373
WHOA-OH-OH-OH-OH!

18:29.909 --> 18:31.311
UNH!

18:31.378 --> 18:32.078
UHH!

18:32.145 --> 18:34.147
AAH!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.628
RARR!

18:48.695 --> 18:51.164
[MUFFLED] RARR!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.673
OH, MAN,
I MISSED THE TRAP!

19:00.740 --> 19:02.809
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS PRETTY COOL.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.843
All: FREDDY!

19:03.910 --> 19:05.512
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

19:05.578 --> 19:06.813
RARR.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.115
NOW, LET'S FIND OUT
WHO THE MONSTER IS

19:09.182 --> 19:10.350
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.919
WHAT PERSON CAN FILL OUT
ALL THIS FABRIC?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.755
NOT WHAT PERSON,
WHAT PEOPLE?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.991
All: CURT AND CONNIE CRUNCH?

19:19.058 --> 19:21.994
KIDS?

19:22.061 --> 19:25.164
THE CRUNCH KIDS WANTED
TO SCARE THEIR FATHER
OUT OF WRESTLING

19:25.232 --> 19:26.866
SO HE WOULDN'T
END UP INJURED...

19:26.933 --> 19:28.435
LIKE HUMONGOUS HAMMER.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.403
THAT'S WHY THEY ONLY ATTACKED
THE MALACHI EXHIBIT

19:30.470 --> 19:32.205
IN THE WRESTLING MUSEUM--

19:32.272 --> 19:35.542
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
HE WAS THE TITANIC TWIST'S
NEXT TARGET.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.677
SO THAT'S HOW
THE MONSTER COULD HAVE

19:37.744 --> 19:39.412
2 ARMS ON ONE SIDE
OF HIS BODY.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.048
BECAUSE THERE
WERE 2 PEOPLE
INSIDE THE SUIT.

19:42.114 --> 19:45.718
BUT HOW DID 2 KIDS
KNOCK OUT ALL THOSE
HUGE WRESTLERS?

19:45.785 --> 19:48.120
IT'S EASY WHEN YOU USE
THE SLEEPING MIST

19:48.187 --> 19:49.956
WE FOUND IN
MALACHI'S TRAILER.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.391
AND THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.693
EVEN IN SPITE
OF YOU MEDDLING KIDS.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.694
HUH?
HUH?

19:54.761 --> 19:55.862
THEY WERE RIGHT.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.331
IT IS ABOUT TIME
THE OLD MAN RETIRES

19:58.398 --> 19:59.932
BEFORE HE GETS HURT.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.468
CURT, CONNIE,

20:01.534 --> 20:03.236
THANKS FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.572
[CROWD CHEERING]

20:08.441 --> 20:11.644
NOW, THIS IS WHAT WRESTLING
IS ALL ABOUT, FOLKS.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.979
FAMILY.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.916
LET'S CELEBRATE LIKE ONE BIG
HAPPY WRESTLING FAMILY!

20:16.983 --> 20:18.685
UNH!
OHH!

20:18.751 --> 20:21.087
IT SURE IS NICE
TO SOLVE A MYSTERY,

20:21.153 --> 20:22.922
AND FOR SUCH
A SWEET FAMILY.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.156
YOU SAID IT.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.193
HEY, WHERE'S SCOOBY?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.962
SCOOBY DOOBY...

20:30.029 --> 20:31.731
DOO!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.566
