00:05.036 --> 00:06.163
Good morning, Mr. Taylor.

00:06.237 --> 00:08.237
How are you enjoying
sleeping in Harry's back room?

00:08.473 --> 00:10.237
No windows, no air, no heat...

00:10.308 --> 00:12.277
- No charge.
- No complaints.

00:14.078 --> 00:15.637
You know, that's where I sleep

00:15.747 --> 00:18.376
when I tell Dolores
I'm visiting my sister.

00:18.783 --> 00:21.218
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- I don't.

00:22.921 --> 00:24.287
I won't be staying long.

00:24.355 --> 00:26.461
I just need a little time
to put some things together,

00:26.491 --> 00:28.460
then, I'm back on my feet.

00:31.029 --> 00:32.520
Oh, man. It's my brother.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.761
Hey, remember, not a word to him
about me staying back there.

00:37.302 --> 00:40.204
Why do you guys
always act like I'm a moron?

00:40.371 --> 00:44.001
I'll explain later
when I have time to talk really slow.

00:46.544 --> 00:48.604
Good morning, guys. Hey, Marty.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.582
Hey, Tim. Can't talk. New job.
Gotta go!

00:52.584 --> 00:53.745
Call me later!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.949
What's his new job?

00:57.021 --> 00:59.923
He's working down at Stu's Fish Market
deveining shrimp.

01:01.693 --> 01:04.992
- Why's his hair all wet?
- Sometimes they fight back.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.094
No, no, no.

01:08.533 --> 01:11.560
He's helping me test out some of those
new high-powered shower heads.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.571
The Binford 6100.

01:13.738 --> 01:16.003
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's a great thing.

01:16.074 --> 01:19.841
You switch it over to pulse,
it'll blow the hair right off your legs.

01:20.378 --> 01:23.246
Oh, by the way, Harry, when do you
want me for Thanksgiving?

01:23.314 --> 01:26.409
I don't want you at all, but if you have
to be there, be there at 2:00.

01:26.951 --> 01:28.920
Great. I'll bum a ride with Marty.

01:29.020 --> 01:31.990
Marty? Marty's taking his family
to your house for Thanksgiving?

01:32.090 --> 01:35.151
No, just Marty.
Dolores frightens the children.

01:37.729 --> 01:40.995
Wait a minute. Our family
always spends Thanksgiving together.

01:41.766 --> 01:44.531
Now Marty's going to your house
for Thanksgiving.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.468
He's taking a shower
in the hardware store.

01:47.639 --> 01:50.575
- Guys, what's up?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

01:50.808 --> 01:52.834
There's a donut in it for you.

01:53.211 --> 01:56.045
Marty and Nancy split up
and Marty's sleeping at the store.

01:59.417 --> 02:03.047
I knew they were having trouble,
but how did it come to this?

02:03.254 --> 02:06.315
Well, in my view, Nancy projected
repressed paternal conflicts

02:06.391 --> 02:08.223
onto the relationship,

02:09.294 --> 02:12.196
while Marty was still grappling
with intimacy issues.

02:14.198 --> 02:16.167
You watch too much <i>Oprah.</i>

02:17.368 --> 02:19.394
Why is he telling Benny this stuff
and not me?

02:19.470 --> 02:22.201
Because Marty feels like
he's hit rock bottom.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.774
Then, when he sees Benny,

02:23.841 --> 02:26.811
he remembers what rock bottom
really looks like.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

03:19.764 --> 03:21.596
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.768
Sending a Thanksgiving meal
to Randy in Costa Rica.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.637
He can run, but he just can't hide.

03:31.109 --> 03:32.941
I didn't cook it, I bought it.

03:33.578 --> 03:36.241
Well, then, he really has something
to be thankful for.

03:37.081 --> 03:38.344
Very funny.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.976
- How was your day?
- Not so good.

03:41.319 --> 03:43.948
Did you know that Marty is
sleeping at the hardware store?

03:44.022 --> 03:46.719
So you're jealous
Harry didn't ask you first?

03:48.893 --> 03:51.590
I'm serious.
He and Nancy have split up.

03:52.096 --> 03:56.659
- Oh, no. What did he say?
- I had to learn this from Benny.

03:56.734 --> 03:59.033
Why wouldn't Marty
bring this information to me?

03:59.103 --> 04:01.072
Well, he's afraid
you're gonna criticize him.

04:01.139 --> 04:03.574
Remember the last time
when Marty and Nancy were fighting?

04:03.641 --> 04:07.339
- I was totally supportive.
- You called him a gutless loser.

04:08.179 --> 04:10.148
In a very supportive way.

04:12.483 --> 04:15.578
Honey, if you want to help your brother,
you're gonna have to realize

04:15.653 --> 04:17.678
this is gonna be
a very tough time for him.

04:17.755 --> 04:20.075
You have to bend over backwards.
You have to be supportive.

04:20.124 --> 04:21.683
You have to be non-judgmental.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.456
I gotta be supportive
and non-judgmental,

04:24.595 --> 04:28.032
but he gets to stay in a hardware store.
Where's the justice in that?

04:39.877 --> 04:41.311
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, Marty.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.141
Glad you're open.

04:46.551 --> 04:50.010
Now I don't have to go downtown
to score that bag of wood screws.

04:50.822 --> 04:52.051
Yeah.

04:53.624 --> 04:55.786
Harry's been looking
for a night watchman, you know?

04:56.294 --> 04:59.423
And, I mean,
I'm just kind of giving him a hand.

05:00.164 --> 05:01.598
Intimidating uniform.

05:04.402 --> 05:07.372
You should've seen me
before I put the shorts on.

05:13.911 --> 05:15.379
I know about you and Nancy.

05:17.114 --> 05:18.548
Benny sold you out.

05:18.616 --> 05:22.485
- Free sandwich?
- Fresh donut.

05:26.157 --> 05:28.319
Is there any way
you guys can work this out?

05:29.327 --> 05:30.761
I don't think so.

05:31.963 --> 05:34.398
You know, we went into counseling
to try to fix the marriage,

05:34.465 --> 05:39.233
but, well, we both realized
we were just looking for a way out.

05:40.771 --> 05:43.240
This is gonna be really hard
on you and the kids.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.010
Marriage hasn't worked for a long time.

05:47.078 --> 05:48.808
She thought
I didn't make enough money.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.405
She said I wasn't ambitious enough.

05:50.481 --> 05:53.007
- Come on, Marty. That's ridiculous.
- I know.

05:53.084 --> 05:55.246
I mean, I think I do pretty good
for myself. Don't you?

05:55.353 --> 05:56.377
Yeah.

05:56.487 --> 06:00.049
Well, you're young, you're smart,
you're talented, you're...

06:00.124 --> 06:02.616
Eating peanut butter with a putty knife.

06:06.831 --> 06:08.163
But you got great legs.

06:10.768 --> 06:12.930
Have you had a chance
to talk to the girls?

06:13.037 --> 06:14.699
Oh, a little bit, you know.

06:14.772 --> 06:18.106
I mean, Nancy gets them one week.
I'm supposed to get them the next.

06:18.175 --> 06:21.043
- Obviously, I can't bring them here.
- Why didn't you just call me?

06:21.112 --> 06:24.674
- You could've stayed at my place.
- No. I didn't want to impose.

06:24.782 --> 06:26.683
You're not imposing. You're family.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.756
You know, with Randy out of
the country, we got a spare room.

06:28.786 --> 06:31.915
- I mean, you could stay there right now.
- That'd be great.

06:31.989 --> 06:34.754
Yeah, and when you get the girls,
they can stay there, too.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.192
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:36.294 --> 06:39.162
- You think Jill will be okay with it?
- Yeah, sure.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.563
There's nothing more important to Jill
than family.

06:41.632 --> 06:45.091
And we want you to spend
Thanksgiving with us at Mom's.

06:45.503 --> 06:47.938
But you've got to put some pants on.

06:51.342 --> 06:52.867
You guys are the best.

06:52.944 --> 06:54.879
- Well, I'll meet you at my house.
- Thanks, man.

06:54.946 --> 06:56.175
You bet.

06:56.747 --> 07:00.843
But it must be great spending the night
with all these tools, huh?

07:01.686 --> 07:04.383
Waking up with the fresh smell
of solvents.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.659
A rack of ball cocks.

07:12.663 --> 07:15.565
But why dream, you know?
Jill's never gonna toss me out.

07:20.538 --> 07:22.769
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hi.

07:23.507 --> 07:25.874
- Oh, that smells great.
- Well, thank you.

07:26.944 --> 07:31.075
Well, I'll have you know,
I talked to Marty. I was very supportive.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.479
I told him we'd do anything we could
to help him.

07:34.552 --> 07:37.386
- I knew you had it in you.
- You'd be real proud of me.

07:37.455 --> 07:41.517
I reminded him that he's family and
he might as well just stay at our house.

07:46.097 --> 07:49.465
- You told Marty that he could live here?
- With us?

07:50.868 --> 07:54.236
Well, just until he gets steady work
and gets back on his feet.

07:54.438 --> 07:57.067
When was the last time
Uncle Marty had a steady job?

07:58.843 --> 08:00.744
I don't even think we were born yet.

08:01.479 --> 08:05.746
Hey, hey. He's got a great job now.
He's gonna be huge in shrimp.

08:11.422 --> 08:13.982
I don't think it's a big problem
to have another person here.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.583
He could sleep in Randy's room.

08:15.993 --> 08:18.473
Well, actually, it might be better
if he stayed in Brad's room.

08:19.563 --> 08:20.997
Wait, wait. My room?

08:21.065 --> 08:24.126
Well, because the girls would like
to be close to their father

08:24.201 --> 08:26.227
and they'd have to stay in Mark's room.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.636
- My room?
- The girls?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.880
Well, he gets the girls
every other week,

08:37.914 --> 08:40.885
so I said that they could stay here, too.

08:41.719 --> 08:44.553
- Okay. Where am I supposed to sleep?
- Randy's room.

08:44.822 --> 08:48.315
- And where am I supposed to sleep?
- Randy's room.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.096
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't we get any say in this?

08:53.164 --> 08:55.065
Brad, Marty is family.

08:55.466 --> 08:58.231
When family's in trouble,
we gotta pull together.

08:58.302 --> 08:59.770
Dad, I'm family. Okay?

08:59.837 --> 09:03.137
And I don't like the thought
of sleeping in a room with Mark.

09:05.476 --> 09:07.843
You think you got it bad,
I gotta stay with you.

09:08.379 --> 09:09.438
Yeah.

09:10.815 --> 09:13.580
Guys, look, just let me talk
to your dad for a minute, okay?

09:13.684 --> 09:17.177
- Yeah, this really sucks.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.756
This really sucks!

09:24.528 --> 09:26.690
You know, I love those girls
and I love Marty,

09:26.764 --> 09:30.030
but how could you invite three people
to live here without even talking to me?

09:30.101 --> 09:33.538
- Without talking to the boys?
- I couldn't help it. It just happened.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.095
You said, "Bend over backwards."

09:35.172 --> 09:37.141
Well, if I bend over
any further backwards,

09:37.208 --> 09:39.507
I'm gonna be staring myself in the butt.

09:47.752 --> 09:49.448
I was just trying to be sensitive.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.684
Well, you have to be sensitive
to us, too. This is an enormous change.

09:52.756 --> 09:56.488
Three people moving in with us,
turning our lives upside down.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.461
- We can handle this.
- No, "We"?

09:58.796 --> 10:01.766
When it comes to handling
things like this, "we" means "me."

10:01.832 --> 10:03.801
Honey, that's just with our children.

10:05.936 --> 10:08.462
I can't agree to this
until we work out the details.

10:08.539 --> 10:10.633
- I've worked out all the details.
- Really? Really?

10:10.708 --> 10:13.405
Okay, who is gonna watch those girls
when Marty is working?

10:13.477 --> 10:14.477
Don't know.

10:15.479 --> 10:17.351
Are the boys gonna get to
move back in their rooms

10:17.381 --> 10:19.077
- when the girls aren't here?
- Don't know.

10:20.284 --> 10:23.049
Do you even know
when they're gonna be moving in?

10:35.032 --> 10:39.060
No way. We're not ready for... Tim!

10:42.406 --> 10:44.034
- Hey.
- Hi, Uncle Tim.

10:44.108 --> 10:45.167
Hi, guys.

10:51.248 --> 10:53.274
Here you go, Mark.
Until Dad puts in the bunk bed,

10:53.350 --> 10:55.717
I'm lending you my good sleeping bag.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.812
In other words, you get the bed.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.352
Yeah, of course.
The older brother always gets the bed.

11:01.725 --> 11:03.091
- That's not fair.
- Okay.

11:03.194 --> 11:06.756
Stronger brother, better looking
brother. Hey, I've got a million of them.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.101
Yeah? Well, I'm smarter.

11:11.168 --> 11:13.330
Then how come you're sleeping
on the floor?

11:16.106 --> 11:19.046
Man, I still can't believe Mom and Dad
are kicking us out of our own rooms.

11:19.076 --> 11:21.443
I know. Just because
Uncle Marty's life is messed up

11:21.545 --> 11:24.845
doesn't mean ours has to be.
We should stand up for our rights.

11:25.950 --> 11:29.614
- Hey, guys, I want to say something.
- Wait. Let me guess.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.982
You've got the cats moving in,
too, right?

11:32.890 --> 11:34.984
No. Actually, I want to say thanks.

11:35.159 --> 11:36.923
I know you gotta hate
being shuffled around.

11:36.994 --> 11:39.862
I just... I really appreciate
you putting up with us.

11:40.831 --> 11:41.890
Well...

11:41.966 --> 11:44.731
Other families,
kids might not be so understanding.

11:45.469 --> 11:47.028
Yeah, we're just givers.

11:51.709 --> 11:55.043
- So does that mean I get the bed?
- No fricking way.

11:57.548 --> 12:00.916
- Daddy.
- Well, honey, what are you doing?

12:00.985 --> 12:03.011
- Why'd you get up?
- I had a bad dream.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.188
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.157
You want me to come up
and read you a story?

12:07.224 --> 12:08.317
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:08.592 --> 12:10.458
- Good night, Brad.
- Good night, Claire.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.264
- Good night, Mark.
- Good night.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.924
Come on.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.764
Well, I think we made a statement.

12:25.609 --> 12:28.579
Girls, how come
you're not eating your pancakes?

12:29.480 --> 12:33.247
- They're not like Mom's.
- I used the same recipe as Mom.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.451
How come they don't taste the same?

12:37.354 --> 12:39.186
Look, I don't have time for this, okay?

12:39.256 --> 12:40.694
It doesn't matter
if they don't taste the same.

12:40.724 --> 12:42.488
You gotta eat them anyway, okay?

12:42.626 --> 12:45.186
Besides, your dad forgot
the secret ingredient

12:45.296 --> 12:47.128
he always puts on pancakes,
remember?

12:47.698 --> 12:52.636
Chocolate chips. Makes
starchy little animals. Look at that.

12:53.270 --> 12:57.207
You got the dalmatians, huh?
Look at this. What do you got there?

12:57.408 --> 12:59.673
Oh, it's an alien with zits. Look at that.

13:01.412 --> 13:03.779
- Cool.
- Thanks, Uncle Tim.

13:04.148 --> 13:06.413
- Thanks, man. You're a lifesaver.
- You bet.

13:07.051 --> 13:09.282
Okay. Kids, I gotta go to work.

13:09.586 --> 13:12.317
- I'll see you later, okay?
- What are you doing today?

13:13.424 --> 13:15.188
Tim got me some handyman work
in Ferndale.

13:15.292 --> 13:17.131
Hey, you sure you don't mind
driving the girls to school?

13:17.161 --> 13:18.841
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- Okay, thanks.

13:18.896 --> 13:19.896
Okay.

13:20.130 --> 13:24.431
- Oh, man. I forgot to make their lunch.
- Got up early. I made it myself.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.373
I knew just what they wanted.

13:26.403 --> 13:28.668
You got the Spam
and squid sandwiches, right?

13:31.075 --> 13:32.634
You guys are unbelievable.

13:32.743 --> 13:35.178
- I mean, how am I gonna repay you?
- Your watch.

13:38.248 --> 13:41.184
- Go on. Go on.
- Have a good day, Marty.

13:44.355 --> 13:47.052
I am so impressed with you.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.311
I've been working with chocolate chips
for years.

13:50.427 --> 13:52.427
Here I thought I was gonna have to do
all the work,

13:52.496 --> 13:55.625
- and you're just taking charge.
- I love taking charge.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.560
Mommy used to kiss Daddy like that.

13:59.036 --> 14:00.937
Well, she doesn't do it very often.

14:04.608 --> 14:06.770
- I thought that was a children's book.
- No.

14:07.778 --> 14:09.542
<i>The Secret Garden</i>
is a children's book.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.275
You had <i>My Secret Garden.</i>

14:12.449 --> 14:14.680
I don't even want you to read that book.

14:17.021 --> 14:18.080
- Hi, guys.
- Marty.

14:18.155 --> 14:22.820
- Hey, Marty. You want some pie?
- Yeah, thanks. Sorry I'm late.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.629
I was working overtime.
Girls give you any trouble?

14:25.696 --> 14:27.665
- No.
- No. They were angels.

14:28.065 --> 14:31.695
- I helped them with their homework.
- Then I corrected it.

14:33.904 --> 14:35.338
Then we put them to bed.

14:35.639 --> 14:37.403
Sounds like
you guys didn't miss a beat.

14:37.474 --> 14:39.568
Listen, I'm gonna go upstairs.

14:39.643 --> 14:41.982
They can never seem to fall asleep
unless I read them a story first.

14:42.012 --> 14:45.107
- Already done.
- They're sound asleep. I'm sorry.

14:45.716 --> 14:48.185
Oh, no, no. That's great.

14:48.719 --> 14:51.188
I ended up reading them
the Al Unser story.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.593
Now let's talk
about the inside of your house.

14:57.661 --> 14:58.832
Let's say you have an interior wall

14:58.862 --> 15:00.634
that you want to spruce up,
make it a little more fun.

15:00.664 --> 15:03.566
That's right. If you want to cover
a dull, unattractive surface,

15:03.634 --> 15:05.500
sponge painting is a great option.

15:06.103 --> 15:07.537
Or you can grow a beard.

15:10.708 --> 15:15.237
To begin with, all you actually need
is a latex paint-glaze mix,

15:15.546 --> 15:17.515
- a sea sponge.
- See? Sponge.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.187
It's a fun project the kids would enjoy
trying to spruce up their own rooms.

15:23.253 --> 15:24.858
And to show you how much fun
it would be for children,

15:24.888 --> 15:26.093
I invited two kids on the show today.

15:26.123 --> 15:28.285
My nieces, Claire and Gracie Taylor.

15:33.363 --> 15:35.491
- Okay, girls. Are you ready to paint?
- Yeah.

15:35.599 --> 15:36.804
- Okay.
- All right, before we do that,

15:36.834 --> 15:39.073
I want you to look into the camera
and tell the audience out there

15:39.103 --> 15:41.766
what Uncle Tim says
whenever he starts a project.

15:41.839 --> 15:45.207
- "Ow, that hurts"?
- Come on. What's he say?

15:46.176 --> 15:47.610
"Call 911"?

15:49.012 --> 15:52.779
- What did I say backstage?
- "Al, your mom's fat."

15:56.386 --> 15:59.117
<i>- You girls are doing a great job.
- Thanks, Al.</i>

15:59.189 --> 16:01.021
<i>And I don't think your mom's fat.</i>

16:01.592 --> 16:03.959
Harry, you got some joint compound?

16:04.061 --> 16:06.621
- Come look. Your girls are on TV.
- You're kidding.

16:06.864 --> 16:10.232
<i>- Well, girls, I love your work.</i>
- Boy, Tim is great with those kids.

16:11.802 --> 16:13.168
Yeah. He sure is.

16:15.038 --> 16:17.701
Hey, if Marty's not coming
to your house for Thanksgiving,

16:17.774 --> 16:20.744
- who's gonna give me a ride?
- I'll have my sister pick you up.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.551
We're losing him. We're losing him.

16:33.357 --> 16:36.521
Run towards the honey pot.
Come on. Come on.

16:45.802 --> 16:47.771
Wake up. You got so much to live for!

16:47.838 --> 16:50.273
Don't choke him, shock him!

16:50.340 --> 16:51.808
Oh, good idea.

16:54.845 --> 16:55.869
Clear.

16:57.714 --> 16:59.012
Do you have an eight?

17:02.786 --> 17:04.755
I win. You're the old maid.

17:08.192 --> 17:10.888
I hate that term. It is so old-fashioned.

17:10.961 --> 17:13.863
You know, women today
don't need to be with men

17:13.931 --> 17:15.559
to feel completely fulfilled.

17:15.766 --> 17:17.598
You're just mad because you lost.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.703
- Hey, Marty.
- Daddy.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.002
Hi. Come here.

17:26.977 --> 17:29.503
Hey, can you two kids go upstairs
for a minute?

17:29.579 --> 17:31.351
I need to talk to your Uncle Tim
and Aunt Jill.

17:31.381 --> 17:32.679
- Okay.
- Go on.

17:32.749 --> 17:34.240
So what's going on?

17:34.318 --> 17:36.344
Well, first I want to say thanks
for everything.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.979
But we don't want to impose anymore.

17:39.456 --> 17:41.618
I'm gonna move the girls
back in with their mom.

17:41.725 --> 17:43.956
You don't have to do that.
We love having you here.

17:44.027 --> 17:45.586
We don't want to overstay
our welcome.

17:45.696 --> 17:48.666
- You're not overstaying your welcome.
- Well, I think it's a problem.

17:48.799 --> 17:51.171
- Really, it's not a problem.
- Yeah, but it is with me, okay?

17:51.201 --> 17:53.636
So I'm gonna go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack their bags.

17:53.704 --> 17:56.367
Marty, you don't have
anyplace else to go.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.134
Well, then, I'll figure something out.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.043
What's that all about?

18:05.449 --> 18:08.009
Well, obviously something about them
being here is bothering him.

18:08.051 --> 18:10.816
Well, I don't want to figure it out.
I bent over backwards for him.

18:10.921 --> 18:13.686
I've been sensitive.
I've changed my whole personality.

18:15.526 --> 18:17.688
And we were all very grateful for that.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.423
I'm worried about the girls.
How are they gonna feel?

18:21.498 --> 18:24.229
You know, about having to
move out of here so suddenly?

18:24.301 --> 18:27.829
- I think you should go talk to Marty.
- I'm tired of fixing things for him.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.271
And I'm tired of talking with him.

18:29.373 --> 18:32.002
What are you gonna say to him
at Thanksgiving at your mom's?

18:32.075 --> 18:33.202
What I say every year.

18:33.276 --> 18:35.836
"You touch that drumstick,
you're gonna lose a hand."

18:41.518 --> 18:42.986
Happy Thanksgiving, Marty.

18:44.388 --> 18:46.755
- Yeah. You, too, Tim.
- We missed you at Mom's,

18:46.823 --> 18:48.689
so she made you a little care package.

18:48.759 --> 18:51.593
Oh, thanks. I already have some.

18:52.229 --> 18:55.688
I hope you got the one with the
dehydrated pumpkin pie. Good.

18:58.168 --> 19:00.741
The way you ran out of my house,
I didn't even want to come talk to you,

19:00.771 --> 19:02.943
but Mom said it's Thanksgiving
and we should just clear the air.

19:02.973 --> 19:05.442
Look, I'm not really comfortable
talking about this, okay?

19:05.509 --> 19:07.080
Oh, yeah, right.
Like I'm real comfortable

19:07.110 --> 19:09.079
talking about another man's feelings.

19:10.247 --> 19:13.342
- What's going on with you?
- There's nothing going on with me.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.977
Okay? That's the point.
I work 60 hours a week,

19:16.053 --> 19:18.818
all I got to show for it is a case
of shrimp forks.

19:19.423 --> 19:21.915
You're going through
a rough stretch, that's all.

19:21.992 --> 19:24.757
I've been going through a rough stretch
for 33 years.

19:25.195 --> 19:26.254
I mean, come on,

19:26.329 --> 19:28.068
I've worked with so many jerks
over the years,

19:28.098 --> 19:30.329
I'm lucky I don't have a
chip on my shoulder.

19:32.469 --> 19:35.530
You've probably got your hands full
with that bug up your butt.

19:37.641 --> 19:39.337
Okay, so I'm a little bitter.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.344
I mean, it's easy for you to say.

19:41.478 --> 19:44.642
- You've always been successful.
- Easy for me to say?

19:45.048 --> 19:46.414
Martin, how about when Dad died?

19:46.483 --> 19:48.349
Was it easy for me
taking care of everybody?

19:48.418 --> 19:50.387
How about working two jobs
to get through college?

19:50.487 --> 19:53.184
How about raising three kids
on a junior salesman's salary, huh?

19:53.256 --> 19:54.928
Oh, well. Obviously,
you can handle it and I can't!

19:54.958 --> 19:56.029
That's not what I was saying.

19:56.059 --> 19:57.698
No, you're more successful
at your marriage!

19:57.728 --> 19:58.799
I wasn't saying that, Marty!

19:58.829 --> 19:59.966
- You're more successful at your career.
- Marty.

19:59.996 --> 20:02.363
Now I find out you're better
at raising my kids.

20:02.466 --> 20:04.435
Is that what this is about, Marty?

20:04.501 --> 20:07.164
Come on, it's always easier
raising somebody else's kids.

20:07.237 --> 20:09.142
You know, when Claire and Gracie
see you and Nancy,

20:09.172 --> 20:10.401
they see a couple in pain.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.012
When they see me and Jill,
they see a guy

20:12.042 --> 20:13.738
shocking the stuffing out of
a teddy bear

20:13.810 --> 20:15.108
and a bitter old maid.

20:17.547 --> 20:20.517
Nancy was right. You know,
I'm never gonna get back on my feet.

20:20.617 --> 20:22.586
I'm just gonna go from one stupid job
to the next.

20:22.719 --> 20:26.156
They're not stupid jobs when you're
using the money to support your family.

20:26.223 --> 20:27.748
You should be proud of that.

20:27.824 --> 20:30.293
That's a time when a lot of guys
just cut and run.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.329
You're facing responsibilities.

20:32.562 --> 20:35.191
That's something to be admired.
And I admire that.

20:37.067 --> 20:38.695
Come on. Let's eat something.

20:39.736 --> 20:41.637
Mom made a nice plate for you.

20:43.707 --> 20:47.075
- You brought the drumstick.
- That's right, and the wing for you.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.182
You're right.
Your house is freezing cold.

20:55.252 --> 20:57.687
Well, I think the pilot light went off
in my furnace.

20:57.754 --> 21:00.314
Would you mind going down
in the basement and taking a look?

21:00.423 --> 21:03.257
Well, yeah, but, you know,
you can do this yourself.

21:03.326 --> 21:06.228
Well, I don't like to go
down there. It's big and it's damp.

21:06.396 --> 21:10.663
- The place gives me the creeps.
- Love basements. Love the creeps.

21:12.669 --> 21:15.434
There it is, Wilson!
I found your furnace!

21:16.473 --> 21:18.169
You got a light down here
or something?

21:18.241 --> 21:20.767
There should be a pull chain
right over the furnace.

21:28.585 --> 21:29.848
Interesting.

21:31.455 --> 21:35.586
You know, Wilson, if you were
to drop the ceiling just a scosh,

21:35.659 --> 21:37.821
you'd have a heck of a rec room
down here.

21:39.796 --> 21:43.324
Foosball table, ping-pong,
the whole nine yards.

21:50.173 --> 21:52.904
Mommy used to kiss Daddy like that.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.306
And look what happened to them.

22:06.523 --> 22:10.187
Guys, let me just... Let me just talk
to your dad for a minute, okay?
