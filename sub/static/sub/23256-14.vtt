WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.480
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.524 --> 00:03.960
- Oh my God.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.788
Juliette...
What did you expect me to do?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.224
- Don'’t move out.
- I don'’t know if you're just

00:07.268 --> 00:09.052
gonna turn around and
go back to those people.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.836
- I'’m suing them!

00:10.880 --> 00:12.925
- I was thinking about going
with Jonah on his European tour.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.928
- I just hope your
interest in me

00:15.972 --> 00:17.539
is entirely about the music.

00:17.582 --> 00:20.063
- You should file a complaint.
- I help my friends.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.499
That'’s just the way
the world works, you know?

00:21.543 --> 00:23.458
- You come back after
all these years,

00:23.501 --> 00:25.242
you'’re going to waltz in here
act like you ain'’t the one

00:25.286 --> 00:26.852
that slit our family in pieces?

00:26.896 --> 00:28.593
- Aren'’t we supposed to
forgive and forget?

00:28.637 --> 00:29.768
- I just want you to know
I'’m trying.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.031
- I appreciate that, son.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.388
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.568
- A song, I'’m hoping, yeah.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.526
Trying to finish it
for Friday'’s show.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.875
- I'’m looking forward to that.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.097
- Oh, I'’m so late!

00:54.141 --> 00:55.707
- Good morning to you, too.

00:55.751 --> 00:56.708
- Sorry. I'’ve just got
to get to Jonah'’s.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.014
We'’re working on a song.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.321
- A lot of that
going on around here.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.758
- Yeah, we are a musical family.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.281
- No, no, no talking!

01:04.325 --> 01:06.109
- Daphne Conrad, the Voice,

01:06.153 --> 01:08.111
taking Nashville'’s Country
Star by storm...

01:08.155 --> 01:09.852
- Shh!

01:09.895 --> 01:12.028
- 14-year-old contestant
wowed a live studio audience

01:12.072 --> 01:13.682
of millions of
viewers everywhere

01:13.725 --> 01:15.510
performing "Without Warning".
- Stop, stop!

01:15.553 --> 01:17.947
Social media'’s already
abuzz calling her a shoo-in

01:17.990 --> 01:20.297
for the finale
just two weeks away.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.778
- Daph!
You'’re a star!

01:22.821 --> 01:24.301
- Stop.
- No, I'’m serious.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.998
- That is so cool.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.783
My goodness, you are a force
to be reckoned with.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.306
I'’m proud of you.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.917
- I'’m so proud of you, too.
- Thank you.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.964
- Son, these girls are giving
you a run for your money.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.922
- I'’m pretty sure
they'’ve blown right by me.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.839
- Did your daddy ever tell
you about the back yard

01:40.883 --> 01:43.799
performances he used to put
on for me and your grandma?

01:43.842 --> 01:45.192
- He did not, but do tell.

01:45.235 --> 01:46.976
- Don'’t tell.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.457
- Every Friday night, he would
drag us into the back yard

01:49.500 --> 01:52.242
and stand up on
the same old stump.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.026
- Here we go.

01:54.070 --> 01:58.161
- There he was lugging that
Silvertone across the yard.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.729
It was bigger than he was.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.383
- That'’s adorable.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.384
- Don'’t you have somewhere
you need to be?

02:03.427 --> 02:05.037
- No, I don'’t, actually.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.388
- Do you remember the first
one I ever taught you?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.780
- No.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.653
- I do.
"The Little Bitty Ditty".

02:13.611 --> 02:17.006
Damn near drove me crazy with
all the practicing we did.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.574
He had to have it just right.

02:21.445 --> 02:24.361
- Dad, I had no idea granddad
taught you how to play guitar.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.233
- More complicated than that.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.670
Let'’s get you to school,
super star.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
- I'’ll see you guys in a bit.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.194
- Bye.
- Bye!

02:31.238 --> 02:32.369
- I'’ll be back.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.024
- Switch it up.
- Switch it up.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.461
- Someone had
a great time at the park.

02:37.505 --> 02:41.117
- Ah, someone'’s late
for a nap.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.642
Come here, baby girl.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.036
Avery, she'’s burning up.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.386
- Yes.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.474
- She feels fine.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.823
- Emily, call Dr. Hayes

02:51.867 --> 02:52.998
and have him
set up an appointment

02:53.042 --> 02:54.130
as soon as possible.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.610
- Sure.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.003
- You can never be
too careful with a fever.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.918
- If it'’s a fever.
- It is.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.399
- I'’m telling you...
- I can take her temperature.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.228
- Yeah, yeah, You two talk.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.452
- You'’ll be happy to know
I'’m going to talk

03:11.495 --> 03:13.236
to Darius tomorrow.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.107
- You sure it'’s even safe
for you to go back there?

03:16.674 --> 03:18.241
All I keep thinking
about is Rosa

03:18.285 --> 03:19.590
and all the people
down there forced

03:19.634 --> 03:21.288
to work in horrible conditions

03:21.331 --> 03:23.899
because they believed
in something that was pure?

03:23.942 --> 03:25.553
I can'’t just
walk away from them.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.643
- I just don'’t want you
to get hurt, that'’s all.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.427
- You don'’t think I can
take care of myself?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.342
- Juliette, we don'’t
really know

03:32.386 --> 03:34.083
what these people
are capable of.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.694
- They don'’t know
what I'’m capable of.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.263
- ♪ We belong

03:40.307 --> 03:42.047
♪ We belong together

03:42.091 --> 03:44.485
- Okay, right there...

03:44.528 --> 03:46.269
- Yep. I feel like
there'’s just a...

03:46.313 --> 03:47.575
- Yeah. No, there'’s too much.
- Too much.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.925
Is that?

03:49.968 --> 03:51.274
- Like we share a brain.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.884
- Oh, then I feel
so sorry for you.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.451
- Yo! I have great news!

03:54.495 --> 03:56.105
- Oh, you found
your tanning lotion?

03:56.148 --> 03:58.890
Oh, wait, no, no, no!
Hair gel is on sale, right?

03:58.934 --> 04:01.110
- Ha. No.
I got you a date.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.459
What are you talking about?

04:02.503 --> 04:04.156
- For the frigging
pajama party, idiot.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.115
Look. And I only had
to pay her $50 bucks.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.727
- Okay. I can get
my own date, asswipe.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.947
Who you bringing?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.123
- Um, your mom.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.125
- Oh, yeah. Stop being such
a bitch, and thank me.

04:16.168 --> 04:19.215
This party'’s gonna be epic.
- No. Actually, your mom'’s epic.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.651
- Oh, that'’s a good one.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.305
Just don'’t forget
to wear pajamas.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.307
- You don'’t have
to embarrass him.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.787
- I'’m not.
I'’m helping him out.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.354
- No, you'’re making fun of him.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.312
- Okay. I won'’t do it again,
- Okay.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.488
- I promise.

04:31.532 --> 04:36.014
So, have you thought of...
thought about Europe?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.668
- Yeah, I have.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.497
- And I'’m still thinking.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.325
- Okay.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.761
35 dates.
- Mm-hmm.

04:43.805 --> 04:48.549
- Two months.
- Mm-hmm.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.507
- It'’s gonna be amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.943
- I promise.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.950
- You'’re not ready.

04:58.994 --> 05:04.173
- Yeah.
Um, I tried to call.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.783
- Uh-oh.

05:05.827 --> 05:09.134
- This is just
really hard for me.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.528
- I know, but I'’m not
gonna let you down.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.139
- You know, you once
said that there are

05:14.183 --> 05:19.014
a lot of moving parts here.
Well, now there'’s too many.

05:19.057 --> 05:22.670
- I'’m telling you, it's gonna
be worth it in the end.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.585
- It'’s just...

05:28.284 --> 05:30.547
I can'’t compete with her.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.114
And with your history with her.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.594
- Look, Alannah...

05:37.424 --> 05:39.426
I'’ve already made my choice.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.298
- Don'’t you see that it's not
just your choice anymore?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.823
- What does that...
What does that mean?

05:45.867 --> 05:47.651
- You have a family.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.872
- I have a daughter.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.702
And that'’s the only thing
that you need to think about.

05:54.745 --> 05:58.401
Okay, just tell me
what I can do.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.185
Anything.

06:00.229 --> 06:05.843
- It, um...
It just needs more time.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.418
- Juliette, I'’m so glad
you'’re here.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.637
Welcome back.

06:21.032 --> 06:24.253
- I asked Laura to sit in.
I hope that'’s not a problem.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.865
- You scared
to be alone with me?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.346
- I think it best
we document this meeting.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.914
- So you can classify me
as unstable?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.437
A danger to myself again?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.352
- No. So we can
understand each other

06:36.396 --> 06:37.788
and learn from this.

06:37.832 --> 06:43.098
My team was concerned,
but overly cautious.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.492
I apologize.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.146
Running a worldwide organization
has its challenges.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.801
If you want to stay on message,
you have to have discipline.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.630
I stand by that, but sometimes
people takes things too far.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.632
- Don'’t give me that crap!

06:55.676 --> 06:58.635
Your team does
only what you say!

06:58.679 --> 07:02.465
And they control people
by fear and intimidation!

07:02.509 --> 07:04.772
- No. We help people
all over the world.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.035
Changing lives,
making a difference.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.863
- Oh, save me the brochure.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.474
What you'’re doing is horrible.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.824
- Everything we do
is within the law.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.652
- Yeah, we'’ll see about that.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.786
- I want justice.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.963
- For the people who
fell for your charade.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.444
People like me!

07:28.752 --> 07:30.058
Oh, it'’s too bad.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.494
I liked it better
when she was here.

07:34.715 --> 07:38.545
- You have no proof,
no witnesses.

07:38.588 --> 07:42.157
You'’re on camera making threats
and irrational statements.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.509
The only person you should
be concerned about is you.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.730
- You really think it'’s gonna
be that easy to shut me up?

07:49.773 --> 07:53.777
- No, but I think this can.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.694
It'’s the nondisclosure agreement
you signed the morning

07:57.738 --> 07:59.914
you left for Bolivia.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.790
You might want to check
the paragraph that spells out

08:06.834 --> 08:09.314
the penalty for breaking it.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.404
- This is not over.
Mark my words.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.887
- Talk to the press,
the Movement will sue you

08:16.931 --> 08:19.237
for every penny you'’re worth.
You will have nothing.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.718
Your family will have nothing.

08:21.762 --> 08:25.505
So, yes, it is over.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.304
Everything okay?

08:42.347 --> 08:44.436
- Call the publicist.
Tell him I have a story.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.960
- This about that
whole Darius thing?

08:46.003 --> 08:47.570
- You'’re damn right it is!

08:47.614 --> 08:51.443
- Listen, Juliette.
Please be careful here, okay?

08:51.487 --> 08:53.271
- Don'’t tell me to be careful!

08:53.315 --> 08:55.186
- ♪ We belong together ♪

08:55.230 --> 09:00.496
♪ We belong we
We belong together ♪

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
- That is gorgeous.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.021
- No, I don'’t think
it'’s there yet.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.980
- Well, all right.
Well, keep at it.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.069
Gee, I guess you have been
working on your music.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.200
By the way, if Jonah
helped you with that,

09:09.244 --> 09:10.419
I owe that boy an...

09:10.462 --> 09:11.594
- No, that
was Twig, actually.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.294
- Jonah'’s best friend.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.469
- Huh.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.822
- Nothing.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.606
- You don'’t even know him.

09:23.650 --> 09:24.912
- I didn'’t...
- He'’s so good.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.653
- I said it was good.
Keep at it.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.571
- Okay, so...

09:33.485 --> 09:35.531
- I'’m thinking about
saying yes to Europe.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.014
- Okay. I just need
you to know

09:40.057 --> 09:41.232
what you'’re saying yes
to, all right?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.625
You know it'’s his world.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.800
They'’re his decisions,
his schedule...

09:46.324 --> 09:47.282
- Do you know
where granddad is?

09:49.893 --> 09:52.330
- No, he'’s not in there.
We were supposed to play.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.723
- I actually haven'’t seen him.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.858
- He barely has a toothbrush.
No, he doesn'’t have a phone.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.816
- Well, he'’s been
out all day again.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.601
- Sweetie, I'’m sure he just went
out for a walk or something.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.254
He'’ll be back soon.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.517
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.656
- It doesn'’t matter what I say.
He keeps doing it.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.832
Because he'’d make sure
I'’d never get another job.

10:15.876 --> 10:16.920
I gotta go.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.923
Alannah, hi.
- Hey.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.055
- He should just be
a couple minutes.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.578
- Okay. No problem.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.753
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.066
Wait, did I lose--

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
Tamara!
Tamara!

10:33.720 --> 10:35.896
Hey, get Tamara back on
the phone for me, will you?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.027
- Yeah, sure.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.691
- Hey!

10:48.735 --> 10:50.214
Oh, there she is!

10:50.258 --> 10:51.215
- Here I am.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.434
- Hey.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
Come on back.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.830
So...
- So...

10:59.571 --> 11:01.530
Let'’s be friends.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.533
- Oh, I like that.

11:04.576 --> 11:05.839
What, uh...

11:05.882 --> 11:07.579
What kind of friends
you wanna be?

11:07.623 --> 11:10.147
- Whatever kind
you want me to be.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.933
- I wonder what
she meant by that?

11:12.976 --> 11:16.284
- She meant that'’s
how the world works.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.461
Isn'’t that what Brad said?

11:19.504 --> 11:21.768
- It doesn'’t sound
very authentic.

11:21.811 --> 11:25.032
- I'’m sorry. Did you want
me to be authentic?

11:26.903 --> 11:28.165
- Always.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.778
- What if I were to say
a fake friend

11:31.821 --> 11:33.823
that doesn'’t even
really like you?

11:36.913 --> 11:39.655
Like all my other friends?"

11:41.918 --> 11:43.398
- That'’s so sad.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.356
- No, what'’s sad is
living in a fantasy.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.749
That'’s what most people do.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.099
- I'’m living right here, baby.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.233
- That'’s the kind
of friend I want.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.675
We should try dinner again.

12:06.943 --> 12:07.988
- Ha.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.034
- I don'’t know.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.340
- What, has
he still not come home?

12:12.383 --> 12:13.689
- No, he'’s not.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.386
- No, but maybe
he'’s just an adult

12:15.430 --> 12:18.085
who deserves a little privacy.
How about that?

12:18.128 --> 12:19.739
- Dad, he'’s an old adult
and he'’s been gone all day.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.392
What if something happened?
- No.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.959
- Nothing'’s happened.
- Dad, I'’m serious.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.656
What if something happened?
- Nothing has, baby.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.528
- Hey, everybody!

12:26.571 --> 12:29.966
Mmm, dinner smells great!

12:34.449 --> 12:36.799
What'’s wrong?

12:41.238 --> 12:43.850
- Yeah.
I ran into some old friends.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.895
We were catching up.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.246
- I'’ve got friends everywhere.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.162
- Well, the girls were worried.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.906
- Oh, well, I'’m sorry.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.430
I guess I just thought,
with all you guys

12:59.474 --> 13:03.391
got going on around here,
who has time to worry about me?

13:03.434 --> 13:05.306
- We do.

13:05.349 --> 13:09.701
- Well, I'’m sorry, and I promise
it won'’t happen again.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.582
- You know, the other day,

13:20.625 --> 13:23.106
he told the girls that
he taught me how to play.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.196
- No. Ping-pong, Scarlett.
Yes, guitar.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.982
- Like he'’s responsible
for my musical career.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.331
That'’s all him, you know.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.549
- Are you sure he
meant it that way?

13:31.593 --> 13:32.812
- I'’ll tell you what.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.769
Any little good that
is inside of me,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.118
he had nothing to do with it.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.641
- I know.
- That'’s a promise.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.382
- Well, how'’s he been
around the house?

13:38.426 --> 13:39.427
- He ain'’t really been
around the house that much.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.645
Keeps disappearing on us.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.648
- Catching up with
old friends, so he says.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.128
Hell, I don'’t know.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.129
I don'’t even know
how much I trust him.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.090
- He better not be drinking!

13:50.133 --> 13:51.439
He'’s drinking,
he'’s outta my house.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.180
I can promise you that.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.834
- I hope he ain'’t drinking,
for the girls'’ sake.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.400
- Used to be if he went out,
yeah, he was drinking.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.837
He was coming home drunk.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.186
- Well, it'’s hard to
trust somebody

13:59.229 --> 14:00.709
after years of all
that kind of thing.

14:00.752 --> 14:01.971
- Scarlett, why'’d you
have to say that?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.451
Now you got that in my head.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.713
- I didn'’t.
You just said it yourself.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.671
- Yeah, well, I didn'’t want to.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.895
- That'’s cute.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.592
- Oh, come on!
He was safe!

14:14.636 --> 14:15.855
- No way that doesn'’t
get called back.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.901
- Yeah. Didn'’t we call it
in like an hour ago?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.120
- Thank you.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.295
Okay, okay.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.687
- You'’re a frickin' animal!

14:25.429 --> 14:27.823
- Oh, it'’s... it's nobody.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.524
- Doesn'’t sound like nobody.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.961
- Yo, maybe it'’s the pizza guy.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.745
- Well, it'’s not the pizza guy!

14:36.788 --> 14:38.312
- Okay.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.405
- It'’s my agent.
It'’s probably about tour.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.015
- I'’ll be right back.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.324
We can'’t keep
doing this, all right?

14:50.367 --> 14:52.935
It'’s just...
It'’s not healthy!

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
- Don'’t say that!

14:54.415 --> 14:56.199
- Do you think that
this is easy for me?

14:56.243 --> 14:57.853
- Then why are you
breaking up with me?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.724
- Do we have to go
over this again?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.074
You know we'’re not
right for each other.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.249
- I'’m trying to get better!

15:02.292 --> 15:03.859
- Mia...

15:03.903 --> 15:05.121
- I can'’t believe
that you did this

15:05.165 --> 15:06.731
right after I
changed therapists.

15:06.775 --> 15:09.082
- I can'’t be the reason
that you get better.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.997
I can'’t.
That'’s not fair.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.913
You need to focus on
your own life right now.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.176
Don'’t tell me what to do!

15:16.219 --> 15:18.308
- I just care about you.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.919
And I want you to be okay, okay?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.529
- Yeah, well,
if you wanted me to be okay,

15:21.572 --> 15:22.791
you wouldn'’t be doing this.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.184
- Look, Mia...

15:29.624 --> 15:34.585
- No. I just needed some air.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.762
The whole Europe thing, what
do you think I should do?

15:37.806 --> 15:38.807
Do you think I should go?

15:40.287 --> 15:45.814
- Well, I think you
should do it, all right?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.163
I mean, how often
do you get to go to Europe

15:47.207 --> 15:49.165
with thousands of
screaming fans?

15:49.209 --> 15:51.341
- Yeah.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.127
Yeah, my dad just keeps
nagging me about it.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.825
Says he thinks I'’ll just be some
like glorified backup singer.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.783
- Hey, well, at least
you'’ll be glorified.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.482
- Okay.

16:01.525 --> 16:04.572
- Yo.
Come on, pizza'’s here.

16:04.615 --> 16:05.834
- Okay.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.605
- Hello.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.173
What are you doing here?

16:40.216 --> 16:41.826
- Um...

16:41.870 --> 16:45.874
- Fellas, this is
my son, Deacon!

16:45.917 --> 16:49.921
Deacon, this is Reggie
and this is Jellyroll.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.836
- Reggie Vaughn.
- Hello.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.621
- Jellyroll Johnson.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.449
- And this is my wife, Rita.
- Deacon Claybourne.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.841
Pleased to meet you.
- Hey, Deacon.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.060
- Reggie and I go all
the way back

16:58.104 --> 17:01.542
to Sycamore Street
in Mississippi.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.501
He'’s the minister at that
church out by the Super 8.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.286
Ran into him and
Jellyroll out there.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.201
Oh, thank you.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.507
- Well, it'’s a pleasure.

17:10.551 --> 17:14.207
- We just been picking up where
we left off about 25 years ago.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.905
- Until the wife kicks us out.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.473
- We'’ve got another guitar
here if you like to join us.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.649
- Oh, no, no.
I gotta...

17:21.692 --> 17:25.435
- At least stick around and
have a glass of cold iced tea.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.655
- Much obliged.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.396
- Be nice to have an audience.

17:31.789 --> 17:35.228
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, I got
a minute or two here.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.925

19:18.331 --> 19:19.636
- Thank you.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.334
- Sure you wouldn'’t
like to join us?

19:21.377 --> 19:24.554
- No. I can'’t do that.
I actually gotta get going.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.339
Thank her
for the iced tea.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.776
It was a pleasure
meeting you guys.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.560
I'’ll see you at home, Dad.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.779
- You bet.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.609
- So, um,
thanks for meeting me.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.698
- Yeah, of course.

19:37.741 --> 19:42.442
- I... I have kind of
a weird question.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.835
I hope it doesn'’t make
you feel uncomfortable.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.576
- Go for it.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.057
- I'’m actually kind of
worried about Leah.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.016
- Well, that was inevitable.
She'’s exactly his type.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.931
- So he'’s done this a lot.

19:53.975 --> 19:57.196
- Oh, yeah. He'’s had six
settlements with ex-employees.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.502
A few of them reached out
after our divorce.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.592
And it was disturbing,
to say the least.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.942
- Wow.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.814
Well, you warned me.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.685
I should have listened.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.513
- Are you sure that
everything'’s okay?

20:10.557 --> 20:14.213
- Yeah.
I can take care of myself.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.605
- Okay.

20:15.649 --> 20:18.434
Well, I'’m here
if anyone needs me.

20:18.478 --> 20:22.264
- Thank you.
We'’ll see what happens.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.749
- I hope you'’re happy.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.533
- Glenn, this wasn'’t
about my happiness.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.056
- Have you ever
heard the expression,

20:32.100 --> 20:34.145
"Don'’t poke the bear"?
Hmm?

20:34.189 --> 20:36.235
- Uh, have you ever heard
the expression,

20:36.278 --> 20:37.627
"Don'’t threaten
Juliette Barnes"?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.412
- Yeah, once or twice.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.936
Listen, the AP picked this up.

20:41.979 --> 20:45.069
CNN, Dateline, Fox News,
they all want exclusives.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.289
So, congratulations,
you'’re now officially at war

20:47.333 --> 20:49.204
with Darius Enright.

20:54.905 --> 20:58.300
- ♪ We belong we
We belong together ♪

20:58.344 --> 20:59.736
- You fixed it.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.650
- Yes.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.522
- Yeah, yeah, of course, I did.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.045
- It sounds perfect.
It'’s amazing.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.569
- So, I realized that
your voice carries us

21:06.613 --> 21:07.657
through the bridge.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.572
So we don'’t need anything else.

21:09.616 --> 21:13.184
And it'’s like a scene in a movie
where nobody says anything

21:13.228 --> 21:15.274
but you can totally tell
what'’s going on

21:15.317 --> 21:18.320
just by the looks, you know.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.020
- Oh, like
metaphorically speaking?

21:24.631 --> 21:27.895
Why aren'’t you
producing artists?

21:27.938 --> 21:29.288
- Well, because
I'’m with Jonah.

21:29.331 --> 21:32.334
- Yeah, not producing.

21:32.378 --> 21:35.206
I don'’t know, Twig.
You'’re just so amazing.

21:35.250 --> 21:38.122
Seriously, I just... why don'’t
you believe in yourself?

21:40.473 --> 21:43.780
- I'’m scared, I guess.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.130
Why?

21:46.174 --> 21:47.697
- '’Cause I...

21:47.741 --> 21:49.177
just like I'’m afraid
I'’m another nobody.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.705
- I mean, you have no idea
what Jonah does for me.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.665
- Okay, like supplying you
a date to a party?

21:58.708 --> 22:00.275
- No.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.453
Like getting noticed and
being treated with respect.

22:04.497 --> 22:05.933
And... I don'’t know.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.674
I feel like he opened up
so many worlds to me

22:07.717 --> 22:11.373
that otherwise I wouldn'’t
be able to get to see.

22:11.417 --> 22:15.986
So, without him,
I would be just...

22:16.030 --> 22:18.728
- Like...

22:18.772 --> 22:22.602
- You'’d be you,
which is enough.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.958
- So why can'’t
I go to Jonah'’s parties?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.395
- Because you'’re underage.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.138
- Underage for parties.

22:37.181 --> 22:40.184
- Hmm.
So tell me about Twig.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.274
- I don'’t know.

22:43.318 --> 22:46.147
You just seem to talk
about him a lot.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.845
- That'’s just 'cause we'’re
working on a song together.

22:48.889 --> 22:51.761
- You sure there'’s
nothing there?

22:54.416 --> 22:55.374
- Yes, I'’m sure.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.335
What?

23:00.379 --> 23:01.728
- You like him.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.773
No, I don'’t like him!

23:03.817 --> 23:05.688
- You'’re blushing!
- No, I'’m not!

23:05.732 --> 23:07.516
Stop.
I do not like Twig.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.214
Shut up. Stop.

23:11.781 --> 23:14.044
Stop staring at me!

23:14.088 --> 23:15.742
Oh, my God!

23:19.485 --> 23:21.356
- Don'’t worry about it, Em.
I can finish.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.444
- Yeah.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.402
- Okay.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.628
- Apparently, the singer was
abusive to fellow followers

23:32.672 --> 23:36.284
and, surprise,
a complete prima donna.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.981
We have multiple
first-hand reports

23:38.025 --> 23:39.853
that the singer
quarantined herself

23:39.896 --> 23:42.812
and demanded special treatment
while she lashed out

23:42.856 --> 23:45.641
verbally and physically
at others around her.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.470
This all coming just days
after Juliette Barnes

23:48.514 --> 23:51.995
released her own account
alleging the exact opposite.

23:52.039 --> 23:55.216
Movement officials claim
the singer was simply trying

23:55.259 --> 23:57.392
to get ahead of the truth.

24:13.147 --> 24:16.367
- Hurry up, boy!
I ain'’t got all day!

24:23.157 --> 24:25.333
No! No!
That is not the progression!

24:25.376 --> 24:27.466
G, A minor, E!

24:31.513 --> 24:33.559
No, that ain'’t it either.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.524
G, A minor, E!

24:42.568 --> 24:45.484
Why is that so hard?
G, A minor, E!

24:45.527 --> 24:48.138
Why can'’t you get this?
It'’s not a hard progression!

24:48.182 --> 24:50.097
G, A minor, E!

24:50.140 --> 24:51.751
It'’s a simple progression!

24:51.794 --> 24:53.622
G, A minor, E!

24:53.666 --> 24:55.581
Don'’t you backtalk me!

24:57.931 --> 24:59.541
Time for you to practice, boy!
- Stop!

24:59.585 --> 25:01.456
- Get up!
- You have got to stop!

25:01.500 --> 25:05.416
You have got to let him sleep!
- You shut up!

25:05.460 --> 25:09.986
G, A minor, E!
G, A minor, E!

25:10.030 --> 25:12.946
G, A minor, E!

25:20.519 --> 25:22.521
- You can'’t eat in your room.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.307
- Two hours of homework
says I can. Bye.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.614
- Looks like
it'’s dinner for two.

25:32.139 --> 25:36.360
Son, I didn'’t mean to put you
on the spot earlier

25:36.404 --> 25:38.188
asking to play with us.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.929
I just thought it'’d be fun.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.670
- Maybe some other time.

25:41.714 --> 25:45.544
- Well, I know the guys would be
happy to have you back over.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.768
Son?

25:52.812 --> 25:55.554
Why don'’t you just say
what you have to say?

25:58.382 --> 25:59.383
- Okay.

26:01.516 --> 26:06.042
You did everything you could
to take away my music.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.828
I loved hearing you play.

26:08.871 --> 26:12.135
- No. You beat me
when I played.

26:12.179 --> 26:15.574
- That is not true!
I loved teaching you!

26:15.617 --> 26:17.488
- That'’s what
you call teaching?

26:17.532 --> 26:19.403
- We had wonderful
times playing...

26:19.447 --> 26:23.364
- I'’m not gonna stand here and
correct your memory, all right?

26:23.407 --> 26:25.018
But what you did was horrible!

26:25.061 --> 26:26.410
And the only love
that I had for music

26:26.454 --> 26:28.151
was in spite of you,
Dad, not because--

26:28.195 --> 26:31.633
- Enough! Enough!
That is so unfair.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.635
Yes, I wanted you to be good.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.463
And, yes, I pushed you.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.378
But I did that out of love!

26:41.861 --> 26:44.603
You think that was love?
Are you that twisted?

26:44.646 --> 26:46.256
The only thing your love
ever gave me

26:46.300 --> 26:48.258
was a habit that
ruined my life!

26:48.302 --> 26:49.999
- I... I had a dream...

26:50.043 --> 26:51.218
- Oh, stop it, Dad.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.568
- That I gave up
of playing music.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.396
And I gave that dream to you!

26:55.439 --> 26:57.398
- Stop it!

26:57.441 --> 27:00.009
What you gave to me is why
we haven'’t spoken in 30 years.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.011
So, no, you do not get to
take credit for my music.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.622
It is mine.

27:12.761 --> 27:16.025
- So I said, "That'’s it.
I'’m starting my own label."

27:16.069 --> 27:18.288
The only person you need in
this business is yourself

27:18.332 --> 27:20.639
and, well, maybe me.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.162
Well, you'’re kidding, right?

27:23.598 --> 27:26.732
- Don'’t--
It'’s corked, all right?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.037
Bring me something else.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.386
- Yes, sir.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.693
- You'’re so nice to people.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.303
- I'’m honest.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.480
Most people find it refreshing.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.831
- Pretty sure you do.
- Oh, that'’s amusing.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.484
- And yet here you are with me.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.096
- Hmm, which I'’m wondering
about right now.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.402
- Nah, you'’re not.

27:45.446 --> 27:46.665
- You really are something.

27:48.449 --> 27:51.408
- I mean, you'’re one of
a kind, I'’ll give you that.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.328
- You like me.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.203
- I couldn'’t like you.

28:03.246 --> 28:06.336
I mean, you'’re everything
I despise.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.775
You use people,
you'’re a narcissist.

28:09.818 --> 28:13.039
And you always have to
have everything your way.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.565
- Shut up.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.480
- You do.
You actually like me.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.264
- I do not like you.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.050
- That is just so funny.
- I don'’t think it's funny.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.231
- I mean, I'’m, uh...

28:31.274 --> 28:32.798
I'’m honored.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.408
I didn'’t think I stood
a chance with you.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.629
- You don'’t.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.632
- I'’m so happy.

28:51.991 --> 28:55.037
- I thought I was helping you.

28:55.081 --> 28:58.301
But my anger
and my drunkenness

28:58.345 --> 29:01.478
turned it into
something else.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.481
And that'’s something
I have to live with.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.268
- That was your gift to me, Dad.

29:08.311 --> 29:13.273
Every single relationship
I ever had...

29:13.316 --> 29:16.189
Rayna, my girls.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.845
Every morning I'’d wake up,
and I'’d look in that mirror.

29:19.888 --> 29:25.024
And the face I'’d see
there would be... you.

29:26.721 --> 29:32.205
- The problem is,
I did love you.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.685
And I did teach you.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.818
And I did want you
to have a good life.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.866
And I don'’t know what
to do with that now.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.392
- Neither do I.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.266
- You'’re better than me.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.401
Don'’t you understand that?

29:54.444 --> 29:59.449
You don'’t have that
meanness in you anymore.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
You broke the cycle.

30:01.060 --> 30:05.891
My daddy drank and beat me.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.850
And I did it to you.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.330
But look at you.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.853
Look at your girls.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.076
I am so proud of you.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.126
We were both victims
of circumstance.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.609
But you rose above it.

30:28.652 --> 30:32.656
And I don'’t wanna mess that up.

30:32.700 --> 30:37.052
So I'’m gonna stay home tonight

30:37.096 --> 30:39.620
and leave you to it.

30:39.663 --> 30:43.754
I don'’t wanna mess up
anything more for you.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.210
- So we went to Italy first,
and I barely made the plane.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.602
- Hey!

31:05.646 --> 31:07.474
- Oh, Maddie!
What'’s up, Maddie?

31:07.517 --> 31:09.693
How you doing?
- Hi. I'’m Maddie.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.957
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
This is Maddie.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.088
This is Brittany.
- Good to meet you.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.089
- You guys just did that.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.351
- Yeah.
- Good.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.787
You know each other now!
Old friends.

31:16.831 --> 31:17.788
- I have to pee.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.138
- Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry!

31:19.181 --> 31:22.271
So, yeah, that way,
through everyone.

31:22.315 --> 31:25.100
- Nice to meet you!

31:25.144 --> 31:26.667
- Wow, you look amazing!

31:26.710 --> 31:28.103
Nice PJs.
- Thank you, thank you.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.975
Very floral.
- She is so cute.

31:30.018 --> 31:30.976
- Yeah, no, she'’s cool.

31:31.019 --> 31:33.195
- Maddies James!
- Hey!

31:33.239 --> 31:34.718
- Wow, you look beautiful.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.243
- Thank you.

31:37.286 --> 31:38.635
- Yes.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.641
- I'’m good. Thanks for coming.

31:44.685 --> 31:45.773
I think they got
you at table two.

31:45.816 --> 31:46.861
- Okay.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.863
Where'’s Gideon at?

31:48.907 --> 31:52.214
Deacon?
- He'’s not coming.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.742
He apologized, but I guess
it'’s just too big for me.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.527
Or I'’m too stubborn
to let it go right now.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.224
- You are stubborn.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.009
- Probably for the best.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.359
Maybe it'’s not.
Maybe I made a mistake.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.796
- Only you'’d know that.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.016
- I'’ll bring him next time.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.281
All right...

32:15.324 --> 32:16.891
Where were you, Stockholm?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.632
- Yeah.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.329
- Couple months, yeah.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.983
- Did you go to any other
places while you were there?

32:26.074 --> 32:27.336
- You waited!

32:27.380 --> 32:28.859
- Yeah, of course!
I'’m a gentleman.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.950
So you want a drink
or something?

32:31.993 --> 32:33.516
- Yeah.
- Cool. Um...

32:37.085 --> 32:39.696
Oh, um, hang on.
Sorry.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.828
Hold that...
Hold that thought.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.309
- No, no, no.
I'’m fine, I'm fine.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.528
Just have fun, okay?
Mingle amongst yourselves!

32:47.617 --> 32:49.010
Okay.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.279
- Wow, you look
absolutely beautiful.

32:57.323 --> 32:59.716
- Thank you.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.023
So, I thought
some more about Europe.

33:03.546 --> 33:04.634
- And I think
it'’s gonna be amazing.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.201
- No way.
- Yes, way.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.290
- No way. You just made this
the best night ever.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.250
- Hey, sorry, buddy.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.686
There'’s an emergency that you
gotta take care of right now!

33:12.729 --> 33:13.948
- Twig, we'’re in
the middle of a moment.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.080
- Right.
No, no, no, no.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.603
You don'’t understand.

33:16.646 --> 33:17.996
You'’ve gotta take care
of this right now!

33:18.039 --> 33:19.780
- Just go deal with it!

33:19.823 --> 33:22.000
- The neighbors are here.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.570
The neighbors are here.
- They'’re super pissed!

33:27.614 --> 33:28.789
- And you gotta
talk to them, okay?

33:28.832 --> 33:30.051
- I gotta talk to them.
It'’s my house.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.531
I gotta talk to them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

33:31.574 --> 33:34.055
- I'’ll be right back.
These guys are the worst.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.535
- I'’m sorry. Be right back.
- Okay, I'’ll come with you.

33:35.578 --> 33:36.449
- No, no, no!
Let him deal with that himself.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.190
It gets so messy.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.235
Just come on.
Dance with me. Let'’s have fun.

33:40.279 --> 33:43.847
- ♪ You don'’t have to say
when you'’re walking away ♪

33:43.891 --> 33:46.067
- Yeah, I like it pulled back.
It'’s cute.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.505
- All right, everybody out!

33:49.549 --> 33:50.898
Give us the room for a minute.

33:56.947 --> 34:00.081
You'’re gonna do
great out there tonight.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.127
I'’m absolutely sure of it.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.606
- Scary when you'’re nice.

34:05.130 --> 34:08.220
- Yeah, well, not many
people get to see it.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.050
- Looks good on you.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.534
- Nothing. I just...

34:18.578 --> 34:21.668
For a second saw what
you were like as a boy.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.106
- All right, I'’ll try
to be more careful.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.194
- It was nice.

34:33.897 --> 34:36.248
- Oh, you are a tough one,
aren'’t you?

34:36.291 --> 34:37.205
- Anything but.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.302
- Listen, you really
should not be here.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.174
- Don'’t you want to see
how I'’ve missed you?

34:49.217 --> 34:51.654
- Okay, I really need you to go.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.003
- And I really need you.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.009
- Chuck Camp, everybody!

35:00.707 --> 35:01.795
How'’d you even come up with
a song like that?

35:01.838 --> 35:03.101
Where'’d that even come from?

35:03.144 --> 35:04.493
- I think I was just
thinking about

35:04.537 --> 35:06.408
why we all became
songwriters, you know.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.976
I remember the first song
I ever fell in love with

35:09.019 --> 35:11.979
was Willie Nelson'’s
"Blues Eyes Crying in the Rain".

35:12.022 --> 35:14.068
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.637
- It was like a whole new world
opened up for me, you know?

35:17.680 --> 35:20.553
Deacon, what was the first song
you ever fell in love with?

35:20.596 --> 35:21.728
- Um...

35:25.210 --> 35:27.037
Well, I guess if I'’m gonna be
honest, the first song

35:27.081 --> 35:28.474
I ever loved is the first song

35:28.517 --> 35:29.779
I ever learned to play on
guitar.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.739
And my daddy taught it to me.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.394
- You can sit if you like.

35:40.050 --> 35:44.054
- And, uh... It'’s called
"Little Bitty Ditty".

35:44.098 --> 35:45.534
- Gotta hear that.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.753
- No, no, you'’re not
gonna hear that one.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.015
That'’s just a little kid's song.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.190
- No, we definitely
gotta hear that.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.583
Y'’all wanna hear that?

35:53.847 --> 35:57.242
- Yeah, all right, all right.
