is your emergency?

00:18.349 --> 00:21.351
(Glass shattering) Hi. My name is
Peter dunlop. There's a house fire

00:21.352 --> 00:23.723
on the corner of
linden and 2nd street.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.656
I don't know if anyone's inside.
Damn it. (Cell phone beeps)

(Indistinct conversations)

01:34.425 --> 01:36.126
How's Peter doing?

01:36.127 --> 01:38.128
Still at the hospital.
Bruised shoulder.

01:38.129 --> 01:41.631
They're getting x-rays just to
be sure. How about the girl?

01:41.632 --> 01:43.833
Critical condition, but
alive, thanks to Peter.

01:43.834 --> 01:47.307
Well, her husband wasn't
so lucky. "Mike applebee."

01:47.308 --> 01:50.810
Unis were here just last week
on a domestic disturbance call.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.643
The wife Jenna... She's
the one who called it in.

01:53.644 --> 01:57.147
Looks like things got a whole
lot worse for the both of 'em.

01:57.148 --> 01:59.149
We know what started the fire?

01:59.150 --> 02:02.121
Ask the arson
investigators. They're inside.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.154
Fantastic.

02:04.155 --> 02:07.158
(Emergency radio chatter)

02:10.231 --> 02:12.732
All right, well, let's
get behind that fridge

02:12.733 --> 02:14.734
and see who or
what started this thing.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.237
Hey, who the hell
let you in here?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.739
Megan hunt, m.E.
Where's the body?

02:19.740 --> 02:22.242
Uh, well, we kept
trippin' over it,

02:22.243 --> 02:25.245
so I had skip here
put it in the truck.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.546
(Men laugh)

02:26.547 --> 02:28.748
I'm ray Easton. My
partner skip rakoski.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.251
Hope you're funnier
than he is. I know I am.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.752
Oh, yeah.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.585
We'll see who's laughing at
your next performance review.

02:35.586 --> 02:38.258
Mm. The body's over
here. We haven't touched it.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.630
So the fire started
here in the kitchen.

02:40.631 --> 02:44.234
Scorch marks form a
"v," like, uh, like an arrow.

02:44.235 --> 02:45.735
Yeah, point of origin. I know.

02:45.736 --> 02:49.199
We also found evidence
of a forced entry.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.742
My partner said he kicked the door
down to get inside. Oh, so he gave the fire

02:52.743 --> 02:55.745
all the oxygen it needed
to consume the living room.

02:55.746 --> 02:58.778
He saved a woman's life. And
if he'd have waited for p.F.D.,

02:58.779 --> 03:00.750
we might have been
able to save two lives.

03:00.751 --> 03:03.713
Or you might have
lost them both.

03:03.714 --> 03:06.386
There's soot in the nostrils.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.888
He was alive while
the fire was burning.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.890
Yeah, you see his pelvis?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.323
I think someone poured
accelerant on him.

03:13.324 --> 03:15.325
How about you
investigate the fire

03:15.326 --> 03:17.327
and leave the body to me?

03:17.328 --> 03:20.570
I'll send my people in to get
him. Yeah, I don't think so.

03:20.571 --> 03:24.234
Excuse me? We haven't
finished our initial assessment.

03:24.235 --> 03:26.536
Nothing leaves the
scene until we're done.

03:26.537 --> 03:30.380
How long you gonna
be? As long as it takes.

03:30.381 --> 03:32.211
I'll get coffee.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.284
Hey, if you don't mind,

03:34.285 --> 03:36.847
I take mine cream, no sugar.

03:40.351 --> 03:42.752
(Megan) Three hours.

03:42.753 --> 03:46.225
That is how much
time I lost to ray Easton.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.727
(Chuckles)

03:47.728 --> 03:50.229
Oh, I worked with Ray's
dad in the badlands.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.231
His whole family's true blue.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.864
Shocking his son
went fire department.

03:54.865 --> 03:57.907
Oh. Ray the black sheep?
I can't even imagine.

03:57.908 --> 04:00.970
Somebody get under
your skin a little?

04:00.971 --> 04:04.774
Looks like Mike has third-degree
burns over most of his body,

04:04.775 --> 04:07.347
with fourth-degree at
the pelvis and right thigh.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.349
Ray said he was doused
with an accelerant.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.250
That would make this homicide.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.253
Yeah, well, you can tell ray
he's wrong. Mike was a smoker.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.256
This flint wheel is all
that's left of his lighter.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.359
It was lighter
fluid that ignited.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.531
You don't want the pleasure
of telling him yourself?

04:21.532 --> 04:25.295
Detective, Curtis tells me
you have a bone fracture?

04:25.296 --> 04:28.298
Of the distal metacarpals...
First and second finger.

04:28.299 --> 04:31.000
Are you asking me or telling me?

04:31.001 --> 04:33.803
You're thebonespecialist.

04:33.804 --> 04:37.307
I just need to know whether
it occurred during the crime.

04:37.308 --> 04:40.380
There's a slight
haze on the X-ray.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.682
It's possible the fracture
happened before the fire,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.685
but I'll run a rapid
touch prep to make sure.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.817
Nothing could make me happier.

04:47.818 --> 04:49.589
(Trash can lid clanks)

04:49.590 --> 04:51.591
Am I missing something?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.593
Kate has a new boyfriend. Oh.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.294
My ex-husband.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
Oh.

04:58.769 --> 05:01.771
I'll call you once
we get a positive I.D.

05:01.772 --> 05:04.474
Hold up. I got Mike
applebee's dental records.

05:04.475 --> 05:07.737
(Sighs) And I just got off the
phone with Peter. How is he?

05:07.738 --> 05:09.739
This guy goes into
a burning house,

05:09.740 --> 05:11.741
the ceiling collapses on him,

05:11.742 --> 05:14.313
and all he gets is
a bruised shoulder.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.816
I mean, it's like he's
made of Adamantium...

05:16.817 --> 05:20.319
Like Wolverine,
from the "X-Men."

05:20.320 --> 05:23.823
You gotta go to the movies. Uh, he's coming, by
the way. Tell him to go back to the hospital.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.356
He needs to bring
me Jenna's clothes.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.598
If she or Mike
were incapacitated,

05:28.599 --> 05:31.861
there'll be trace on the clothing. Ah,
but I know what incapacitated them.

05:31.862 --> 05:34.364
Jenna's tox screen shows
cyanide in her system.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.366
Cyanide. Hmm. This
is starting to sound like

05:36.367 --> 05:39.338
more than just a domestic
disturbance gone wrong.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.672
Except that when a house
burns, it releases toxins in the air,

05:42.673 --> 05:44.774
the most dangerous of
which is hydrogen cyanide.

05:44.775 --> 05:48.778
Wait. So Jenna was
poisoned by her own house?

05:48.779 --> 05:52.382
We just need to find out
what made the house burn.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.654
You think you could
nudge your friend ray along?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.826
Oh, yeah. I'm walking
right in the middle of that.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.458
Mm.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.461
Ethan, are you sure

06:01.462 --> 06:04.394
these are Mike
applebee's dental records?

06:04.395 --> 06:06.135
Yeah. Why?

06:06.136 --> 06:09.469
Mike applebee had all of
his wisdom teeth removed.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.742
That guy in there...
He still has his.

06:12.743 --> 06:15.445
This is not Mike applebee.

06:15.446 --> 06:16.946
(Fabric snaps)

06:16.947 --> 06:19.379
♪♪♪

06:38.669 --> 06:40.831
(Tweezers clatter)

06:43.073 --> 06:44.574
(Camera shutter clicks)

06:44.575 --> 06:46.405
Thanks. I'll let her know.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.007
That was Sam.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.640
No match on John
Doe's prints in a.F.I.S.

06:50.641 --> 06:53.012
And no sign of the real
Mike applebee either.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.715
Does that look like
a fracture to you?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.987
Tough to say. It's
right on the suture line.

06:57.988 --> 07:00.820
You think he broke his
hand fighting off his attacker

07:00.821 --> 07:03.052
and then got hit in the head?

07:03.053 --> 07:05.725
There's only one
way to find out.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.026
(Sighs)

07:07.027 --> 07:09.058
(Whirring)

07:09.059 --> 07:11.661
You know, relationships
are hard, especially when

07:11.662 --> 07:14.964
it involves three people,
and two of 'em have history.

07:14.965 --> 07:18.067
(Whirring stops) And suddenly we're
not talking about the applebees anymore.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.740
What is on your mind, Curtis?

07:20.741 --> 07:23.743
I want you to know
that 99.9% of the time,

07:23.744 --> 07:26.746
when it comes to you,
I'm gonna side with Kate.

07:26.747 --> 07:30.149
But on her decision to date
your ex, I think she's wrong.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.522
Like, Michael Jordan
playing baseball kind of wrong.

07:32.523 --> 07:35.785
Wow. We actually
agree on something...

07:35.786 --> 07:37.787
0.1% of the time.

07:37.788 --> 07:41.130
(Whirring) So keep that
in mind when I say this.

07:41.131 --> 07:43.963
(Whirring stops) As deputy
chief medical examiner,

07:43.964 --> 07:47.166
you two need to work it
out. I am being professional.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.069
(Whirring) Mm-hmm.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.772
John Doe's cause of
death... (Whirring stops)

07:52.773 --> 07:55.675
Um, was carbon
monoxide poisoning.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.747
Uh, his levels were 56%.

07:57.748 --> 08:00.049
He didn't... He
didn't stand a chance.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.612
See if you can salvage
anything out of that wallet,

08:02.613 --> 08:06.156
help identify him. Thank you.

08:08.218 --> 08:11.220
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:11.221 --> 08:14.525
(Ventilator hissing)

08:16.096 --> 08:19.799
Hey. Skip rakoski.
Arson investigation.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.101
Oh. Peter dunlop. M.E.'S office.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.104
Ah, so you're the
superhero, huh?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.177
You look good for a guy
who ran into a burning house.

08:28.178 --> 08:31.040
Well, my shoulder's pretty
banged up. How's Jenna doing?

08:31.041 --> 08:33.042
Well, they're still treating her

08:33.043 --> 08:35.615
for carbon monoxide
and cyanide toxicity.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.887
At least she's doing better

08:37.888 --> 08:41.090
than the John Doe we
pulled out of the house.

08:41.091 --> 08:43.623
Oh, I-I never saw him.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.795
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

08:45.796 --> 08:49.298
You did more than
most people would've.

08:49.299 --> 08:53.232
Are those Jenna's clothes?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.935
Uh, yeah. Dr. Hunt
wanted them for evidence.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.138
My boss sent me for them,
too. Guess I'm too late.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.641
Great minds, huh?

09:01.642 --> 09:04.143
I have to get
back to the office.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.146
I'll let you know if we hear
anything about the clothes.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.878
Thanks.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.250
Hey, take it easy on
that shoulder, huh?

09:11.251 --> 09:13.954
Trust me, it's been
through worse.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.259
Will you please let me
go? I need to see Jenna.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.762
Sorry, Mike. We're
not in the habit

09:22.763 --> 09:24.894
of reuniting victims
with their attackers.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.196
I would never hurt
Jenna. I love her.

09:27.197 --> 09:30.339
Then why the domestic
disturbance call?

09:30.340 --> 09:33.142
(Sighs)

09:33.143 --> 09:35.645
Last few months...

09:35.646 --> 09:38.147
Have been hard.

09:38.148 --> 09:40.079
I lost my job.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.082
Jenna's a manager
at the donut spot

09:43.083 --> 09:45.915
at the bourse... double shifts.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.618
She started pulling away.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.289
She'd never come home.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.292
So I call her on it,
and she kicks me out.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.194
So you went over
there last night

09:55.195 --> 09:58.197
to talk some sense into her,
found her with another man.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.270
Didn't happen. Then
where were you last night?

10:01.271 --> 10:02.932
Same place you found me...

10:02.933 --> 10:05.374
Alone in my motel room,

10:05.375 --> 10:07.076
reading.

10:07.077 --> 10:09.779
Reading? Yeah.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.983
What's a guy like you
have on his nightstand?

10:14.284 --> 10:17.847
Ohh.

10:17.848 --> 10:20.721
"The girl who played with fire."

10:28.859 --> 10:31.300
The cerebral convolutions
have flattened,

10:31.301 --> 10:34.363
and the tissue is markedly firm.

10:34.364 --> 10:37.066
We could be looking
at heat fissure.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.068
If temps got high enough,
the expansion pressure

10:39.069 --> 10:41.370
could've caused the
break in the temporal bone.

10:41.371 --> 10:44.313
I don't think so. Look at that.

10:44.314 --> 10:46.746
Hemorrhaging.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.749
Someone hit John Doe over
the head while he was alive.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.220
For all we know,

10:51.221 --> 10:54.824
the murder weapon
could still be at the scene.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.056
(Sighs)

10:58.989 --> 11:00.289
(Ray) Hey. (Tool clanks)

11:00.290 --> 11:02.291
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

11:02.292 --> 11:05.064
You are aware this is
an active fire scene, right?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.235
Active?

11:06.236 --> 11:08.838
You've been here ten hours.

11:08.839 --> 11:11.841
You haven't even left the kitchen.
Well, collecting fire evidence

11:11.842 --> 11:14.343
is a little like being
on a first date.

11:14.344 --> 11:17.346
Move too fast, you're liable
to get slapped in the face.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.249
(Chuckles) Well, you're
in no danger of that.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.312
Ray just wants it done right so he
can fire Geraldine. Who is Geraldine?

11:23.313 --> 11:25.755
Show her the picture, ray.

11:25.756 --> 11:29.118
(Laughs) You're gonna love this.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.260
(Cell phone beeps)
Meet Geraldine,

11:31.261 --> 11:32.962
my Cannon.

11:32.963 --> 11:35.394
I... (Laughs) I know,
but when I close a case,

11:35.395 --> 11:37.396
I like to light her
up to celebrate.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.929
She's smaller than a bread box,

11:39.930 --> 11:41.971
but she packs
one hell of a wallop.

11:41.972 --> 11:44.804
Well, some people think size
doesn't matter. (Skip and ray laugh)

11:44.805 --> 11:48.707
Skip, will you show the doctor
what we've figured out, please?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.740
The point of origin
is this old refrigerator.

11:50.741 --> 11:53.743
They kept alcohol on top. We
found this broken vodka bottle.

11:53.744 --> 11:56.445
Dust and debris collect
behind the refrigerator,

11:56.446 --> 11:59.889
and you add alcohol to the mix and... (Ray) And
then just a little spark from an old compressor

11:59.890 --> 12:02.021
and bam, you
got yourself a fire.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.422
This wasn't an accident.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.056
Really? Well, what do
you think happened?

12:07.057 --> 12:10.499
Our John Doe was hit
over the head premortem.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.201
That was intentional.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.503
I'm guessing that the
fire was intentional, too.

12:14.504 --> 12:16.505
Did you find a
murder weapon yet?

12:16.506 --> 12:19.839
Not just yet, but we haven't
made it into the living room.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.871
Mm.

12:21.872 --> 12:24.874
Well, I'm no m.E., but
this looks like heat fissure.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.747
You have seen heat
fissure, haven't you?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.920
Oh, you're right.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.421
You're no m.E.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.423
(Ray and skip chuckle)

12:34.424 --> 12:37.026
Look, I've got six open cases,

12:37.027 --> 12:40.029
including a serial arsonist
who's been targeting toy stores,

12:40.030 --> 12:43.032
so how about you cut
me a little slack, okay?

12:43.033 --> 12:45.034
I came here looking
for a murder weapon,

12:45.035 --> 12:47.336
which may or may
not be in this house.

12:47.337 --> 12:49.338
The sooner you
get out of my way,

12:49.339 --> 12:52.371
the sooner you can
fire your little Cannon off.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.873
(Laughs)

12:53.874 --> 12:57.176
(Elevator bell dings)

12:57.177 --> 12:59.879
(File thuds)

12:59.880 --> 13:01.480
Hey.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.184
Look who I found applying for a
job at engine 16. Hey! (Laughs)

13:05.185 --> 13:07.556
Oh, uh, whoa. Ohh!
How's the shoulder?

13:07.557 --> 13:10.319
I'll survive. These are
for you. Jenna's clothes.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.422
She's still unconscious. Great. I will
get Curtis to process them for trace.

13:13.423 --> 13:16.425
Maybe we can find a connection to
Mike applebee. Oh, we may already have.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.098
A search of his motel
room turned up this.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.200
What is that?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.501
Book weight.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.475
Okay. Size and shape are
consistent with the wound.

13:26.476 --> 13:28.477
I'm not too sure about the heft.

13:28.478 --> 13:30.479
Oh, believe me, a
blow to the temple

13:30.480 --> 13:33.482
with the weighted end could
definitely incapacitate someone. Peter?

13:33.483 --> 13:37.146
(Sighs) I'll have forensics take
a look. Welcome back, huh?

13:37.147 --> 13:40.150
You're my hero.
Parade's over, pal.

13:48.058 --> 13:50.399
So Megan's ex? Really?

13:50.400 --> 13:52.431
Not gonna happen, Ethan.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.533
Dr. Hunt.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.335
Dr. Murphy.

13:56.336 --> 14:00.209
Did you finish
yourrapid touchprep yet?

14:00.210 --> 14:02.541
You know what?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.374
I think I left something in
a place that isn't here, so...

14:05.375 --> 14:08.077
It's fine, Ethan. And, no,
John Doe's bone tissue

14:08.078 --> 14:10.079
needs to decalcify
for another half-hour.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.121
Did you find
anything that could be

14:12.122 --> 14:15.124
our blunt force trauma weapon?
Maybe, but believe it or not,

14:15.125 --> 14:17.326
ray Easton is still
processing the scene.

14:17.327 --> 14:19.628
That man is a pain in my ass.

14:19.629 --> 14:22.933
Hmm. A lot of people say
the same thing about you.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.636
So is it gonna be
like this from now on?

14:27.637 --> 14:29.638
Why do you ask me?

14:29.639 --> 14:32.271
She's the one who decided
to date my ex-husband.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.273
Ask her.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.445
So our John Doe's wallet...

14:36.446 --> 14:38.577
I found this tucked deep inside.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.579
Not much was salvageable

14:40.580 --> 14:42.581
in the way of identification,

14:42.582 --> 14:45.584
but I was able to get
something from inside the leather

14:45.585 --> 14:48.657
where a credit card...
Left an impression.

14:48.658 --> 14:50.359
(Beeping)

14:50.360 --> 14:52.421
Okay. It just needs to scan.

14:52.422 --> 14:55.364
This is pretty cool, right?

14:55.365 --> 14:57.526
"Families...

14:57.527 --> 14:59.369
Reconnected."

15:05.435 --> 15:07.476
I'm so sorry, Ms. Armstrong.

15:07.477 --> 15:10.179
Had I known that
Ben was in the house,

15:10.180 --> 15:12.181
I would've tried to save him.

15:12.182 --> 15:15.484
(Sniffles) Ben and I
started families reconnected

15:15.485 --> 15:19.488
to reunite adopted children
with their birth parents.

15:19.489 --> 15:22.591
(Chuckles) We were our
own best advertisement.

15:22.592 --> 15:25.594
I gave Ben up for adoption

15:25.595 --> 15:27.596
when I was 21.

15:27.597 --> 15:30.099
30 years later, he
found me. (Chuckles)

15:30.100 --> 15:32.601
I lost him once as a baby

15:32.602 --> 15:35.966
and to lose him again...

15:37.467 --> 15:41.310
Um, was Jenna applebee a client?

15:41.311 --> 15:42.611
Uh, yes.

15:42.612 --> 15:45.274
(Sniffles) She left a
message at the office.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.575
She was distraught.

15:46.576 --> 15:48.577
Ben must've gone
over to talk to her.

15:48.578 --> 15:50.279
About what?

15:50.280 --> 15:52.621
Her birth father,
Daniel Robinson.

15:52.622 --> 15:55.985
We found him
living in center city.

15:55.986 --> 15:58.657
Two days ago, Ben
went to his home.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.659
It didn't go well.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.661
Mr. Robinson...

16:02.662 --> 16:06.396
(Sighs) Closed the
door on Ben's hand.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.739
You don't think
that Daniel Robinson

16:10.740 --> 16:13.502
had something to do with this?

16:13.503 --> 16:16.005
Um, I'm afraid it's
too soon to know,

16:16.006 --> 16:18.247
but I promise,
we'll... we'll find out.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.309
(Peter) Daniel Robinson...

16:20.310 --> 16:22.611
Chair of the chemistry
department at penn hill college.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.613
Wife Carol. Daughter Emily.

16:24.614 --> 16:27.556
2-story house on rittenhouse
square. The perfect life.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.558
Until Ben showed up
talking about Jenna.

16:29.559 --> 16:31.560
Yeah, but Daniel doesn't
want to hear about it.

16:31.561 --> 16:34.163
He slams the door on
Ben's hand. What a guy.

16:34.164 --> 16:36.365
All right. This was two
days ago? That's right.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.667
That's consistent with
the age of his injuries.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.669
But just because this
Daniel Robinson didn't want

16:40.670 --> 16:44.733
a relationship with Jenna doesn't
mean he wanted her dead. Somebody did.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.705
All I can guarantee you is that

16:46.706 --> 16:48.707
Ben didn't injure his hand fighting
off an attacker. (Cell phone rings)

16:48.708 --> 16:50.409
(Sighs) (Beeps)

16:50.410 --> 16:53.412
One thing's for sure. If
Daniel Robinson did do this,

16:53.413 --> 16:56.415
he's gonna get a lot more than his
hand slammed in the door. (Ring)

16:56.416 --> 16:57.786
Peter dunlop.

16:57.787 --> 16:59.688
Based on what?

16:59.689 --> 17:02.091
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:02.092 --> 17:03.252
(Beep)

17:03.253 --> 17:07.126
(Scoffs) They just
arrested Mike applebee.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.699
(Sighs)

17:21.371 --> 17:23.372
How could you
arrest Mike applebee

17:23.373 --> 17:25.374
before even talking
to Daniel Robinson?

17:25.375 --> 17:27.376
Mike applebee has motive
as a jealous husband.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.478
He has no alibi, and we
have forensic evidence

17:29.479 --> 17:31.550
that directly ties
him to the crime.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.483
Forensics on the book weight were
inconclusive. But the vodka bottle we recovered

17:34.484 --> 17:36.355
came back from the lab.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.827
Applebee's prints are all
over it. He used to live there.

17:38.828 --> 17:42.591
His prints could've gotten on that bottle months
ago. (Bud) Or they got there the night of the fire.

17:42.592 --> 17:46.365
Applebee's prints were the only ones on the
bottle. (Ray) Look, you're the one who insisted

17:46.366 --> 17:48.367
that the fire
wasn't an accident.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.201
I thought you'd have been happy we nailed
someone for it. Not if you got the wrong guy.

17:52.202 --> 17:54.843
(Sighs) You know
what I find puzzling?

17:54.844 --> 17:57.376
Is why we're all
justifying ourselves to you.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.648
And yet still not
succeeding. Hmm.

17:59.649 --> 18:02.151
(Peter) Daniel Robinson
is a chemistry professor.

18:02.152 --> 18:04.113
He knows about
combustible materials.

18:04.114 --> 18:06.115
Jenna applebee is the
daughter that he never wanted,

18:06.116 --> 18:08.617
so she comes back into his life,

18:08.618 --> 18:11.620
and then she ends up in the
hospital. The vodka was the accelerant.

18:11.621 --> 18:14.363
Applebee's prints are
the only ones on the bottle.

18:14.364 --> 18:17.366
My line of work, that's a smoking
gun. You weren't in that house.

18:17.367 --> 18:21.330
When I got to Jenna,
she called me "dad."

18:21.331 --> 18:24.533
Try explaining that, huh?

18:24.534 --> 18:28.237
Did you know about that?

18:28.238 --> 18:30.240
No.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.688
(Turns engine off)

18:43.253 --> 18:46.495
Looks like Daniel Robinson
does very well for himself.

18:46.496 --> 18:48.397
Come on.

18:48.398 --> 18:50.899
The car ride over
was quiet enough.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.902
I'm sorry. This is all
getting a little too personal.

18:53.903 --> 18:55.464
Well, that's understandable.

18:55.465 --> 18:57.736
You pulled Jenna
out of burning building.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.468
But withholding evidence?

18:59.469 --> 19:01.170
(Sighs)

19:01.171 --> 19:03.172
What's going on with you?

19:03.173 --> 19:06.175
I know what it's like to
wonder about your birth parents,

19:06.176 --> 19:08.177
because I wondered
about mine for years.

19:08.178 --> 19:11.480
Excuse me? You were adopted?

19:11.481 --> 19:13.422
Before my dad died,

19:13.423 --> 19:15.924
he gave me a sealed envelope.

19:15.925 --> 19:18.727
Inside was information
about my birth parents.

19:18.728 --> 19:21.430
All I had to do was look,

19:21.431 --> 19:23.432
but I... I couldn't.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.566
So I put it in his coffin,
and I said good-bye.

19:28.438 --> 19:32.471
You know, I thought that
after I'd buried my father

19:32.472 --> 19:35.474
that all those questions
were behind me...

19:35.475 --> 19:36.775
Who I was,

19:36.776 --> 19:40.309
where I came from, and...

19:40.310 --> 19:42.611
Take it from me.

19:42.612 --> 19:44.613
Just because you
Bury your father,

19:44.614 --> 19:46.915
the questions don't
get buried with him.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.917
Hey, you're not the only one

19:48.918 --> 19:52.621
who gets to make annoying
personal observations.

19:52.622 --> 19:54.964
I guess not.

19:56.626 --> 19:59.328
Fancy.

19:59.329 --> 20:02.431
I'm glad that you feel like
you can talk to me. I am.

20:02.432 --> 20:04.433
But if Daniel Robinson is here,

20:04.434 --> 20:06.435
maybe I should do the talking?

20:06.436 --> 20:07.737
Knock yourself out.

20:12.512 --> 20:17.986
Hi. I'm Dr. Megan hunt, with
the medical examiner's office.

20:17.987 --> 20:20.489
Is Daniel Robinson here?

20:20.490 --> 20:24.493
Yeah. Uh, dad, there's
some doctor here to see you.

20:24.494 --> 20:25.794
Can I help you?

20:25.795 --> 20:28.657
We're here about Jenna applebee.

20:28.658 --> 20:30.300
We know she's your daughter.

20:32.502 --> 20:34.803
We also know Ben
dupres came here

20:34.804 --> 20:36.905
to tell you that Jenna
wanted to see you.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.908
I told that guy to forget
he'd ever found me.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.670
Was that before or after

20:41.671 --> 20:43.872
you smashed his hand in the
front door? That was an accident.

20:43.873 --> 20:45.974
The fire that killed
him wasn't. He's dead?

20:45.975 --> 20:48.547
Jenna's in I.C.U.
At Franklin hospital

20:48.548 --> 20:51.520
for cyanide poisoning and smoke
inhalation because somebody

20:51.521 --> 20:53.982
set fire to her house. Do
you know anything about that?

20:53.983 --> 20:56.425
I've never been
there. I was very clear.

20:56.426 --> 20:58.727
I didn't want any
contact with Jenna,

20:58.728 --> 21:02.561
but then she showed up here last night. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute. Jenna was here?

21:02.562 --> 21:05.464
She said that she
needed to talk to me,

21:05.465 --> 21:08.467
that she'd taken the train
all the way from olney,

21:08.468 --> 21:11.470
that the least I could do
was give her some answers.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.303
And you sent her
packing, right? I asked her

21:14.304 --> 21:17.606
to respect my decision
and to leave my family alone.

21:17.607 --> 21:19.608
Now that may seem
heartless to you,

21:19.609 --> 21:21.610
but my wife would
never understand.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.952
Sounds like you got
a lot to lose, professor.

21:23.953 --> 21:26.585
I didn't harm Jenna...

21:26.586 --> 21:28.016
Or Ben dupres.

21:28.017 --> 21:30.019
Now please just leave me alone.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.662
(Door opens)

21:33.663 --> 21:35.064
(Door closes)

21:36.666 --> 21:39.368
I didn't get anything
off of Jenna's clothes

21:39.369 --> 21:41.370
that points to a suspect,

21:41.371 --> 21:44.302
just a bunch of toxic
trace materials. Poor girl.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.305
She was just trying to figure out
where she came from. How's she doing?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.608
Her doctors don't know
if she's gonna wake up,

21:49.609 --> 21:52.310
but at least she still
has a chance. Yeah.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.543
What's that? The
bottom of Jenna's shoe.

21:54.544 --> 21:57.616
I'm using it as a timeline
to trace her last day.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.848
First there are
traces of a chelator,

21:59.849 --> 22:01.920
disodium ethanoldiglycinate,

22:01.921 --> 22:04.322
typically found in
commercial floor cleaners.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.595
Probably from the doughnut
shop where she worked.

22:06.596 --> 22:10.098
And on top of that, I
found this Clay pebble...

22:10.099 --> 22:12.902
The kind people use to
decorate froufrou gardens.

22:14.764 --> 22:16.665
Daniel Robinson
had pebbles like this

22:16.666 --> 22:18.667
lining his walkway,

22:18.668 --> 22:20.669
which confirms that
Jenna was there.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.641
Did she step in paint?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.673
Yeah. Alkyd resin.

22:24.674 --> 22:26.945
City traffic paint.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.747
So she leaves Daniel's.

22:28.748 --> 22:33.452
On her way to the station,
she steps in wet paint.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.784
What's up?

22:35.785 --> 22:39.028
Jenna applebee is dead.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.611
You did everything
you could, Peter.

23:02.612 --> 23:04.613
Tell that to Louisa Armstrong.

23:04.614 --> 23:07.616
Her son is dead, and
we still don't know why,

23:07.617 --> 23:10.789
and now Jenna.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.961
I can handle this one myself.

23:12.962 --> 23:15.464
Get out of here.

23:15.465 --> 23:17.567
Thank you.

23:19.569 --> 23:21.570
Is he okay?

23:21.571 --> 23:23.072
Yeah.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.506
What are you doing?

23:27.507 --> 23:28.907
Smell this.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.840
Not a chance.

23:35.485 --> 23:38.517
It smells like bitter almonds.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.818
Hydrogen cyanide.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.821
If you and that button nose
of yours can smell the cyanide,

23:42.822 --> 23:45.995
why did we pay for a
rush on Jenna's tox?

23:49.499 --> 23:52.130
Her cyanide level was lethal.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.633
Didn't the hospital
give her 100% oxygen?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.465
They administered
hydroxocobalamin, too.

23:56.466 --> 23:57.766
She was responding.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.768
If the treatment was working,

23:59.769 --> 24:02.571
why is her cyanide
level so high?

24:02.572 --> 24:05.013
Someone gave her cyanide

24:05.014 --> 24:07.946
in the hospital.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.519
(Sighs)

24:11.020 --> 24:14.022
You want to tell me how Mike
applebee poisoned his wife

24:14.023 --> 24:15.524
from a holding cell?

24:15.525 --> 24:17.526
We made a mistake, all right?

24:17.527 --> 24:19.688
Bud's releasing him now.

24:19.689 --> 24:21.690
I spoke with skip already.

24:21.691 --> 24:24.833
Ray's in Lancaster working
on a case. He's on his way back.

24:24.834 --> 24:27.536
Whoever did this was counting
on cyanide being overlooked

24:27.537 --> 24:30.999
because Jenna had already been exposed
to it in the fire. Now might be a good time

24:31.000 --> 24:33.702
for you guys to pay
Daniel Robinson a visit.

24:33.703 --> 24:36.805
Yeah, but how did Daniel know
about the cyanide poisoning

24:36.806 --> 24:41.009
in the first place? I, uh, told
him about Jenna's condition

24:41.010 --> 24:44.012
when Megan and I went
to see him at his house.

24:44.013 --> 24:46.685
Well, hospital security sent
over hours of surveillance

24:46.686 --> 24:49.588
of the hallway
outside Jenna's room.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.120
It's just gonna take a while
to get through it, though.

24:52.121 --> 24:54.623
I found cyanide in
Jenna's I.V. Port.

24:54.624 --> 24:57.025
Given the lethal
level in her blood,

24:57.026 --> 24:59.267
she would have been
dead in about an hour.

24:59.268 --> 25:01.269
Counting back
from time of death,

25:01.270 --> 25:03.271
the killer would've
been in her room...

25:03.272 --> 25:04.903
Between 4:00 and 6:00 P.M.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.505
If you guys need
another set of eyes...

25:07.506 --> 25:09.638
Well, skip said he
could help out, too.

25:09.639 --> 25:11.640
He'll be here in an hour.

25:11.641 --> 25:13.511
Have fun.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.813
(Papers rustle)

25:14.814 --> 25:17.616
(Megan) Did the hospital
note head trauma?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.517
(Ethan) Uh... yep.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.989
Blunt force trauma

25:20.990 --> 25:22.751
to the temporal region.

25:22.752 --> 25:25.253
Maybe something
fell on her in the fire?

25:25.254 --> 25:26.755
I don't think so.

25:26.756 --> 25:29.658
If somebody subdued Ben, they
probably did the same to Jenna.

25:29.659 --> 25:31.660
Wheel him over here, will ya?

25:31.661 --> 25:33.162
Yep.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.643
Those are completely
different wound patterns.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.915
Uh, two different weapons?
Doesn't make sense.

25:46.916 --> 25:49.918
Why use one on Ben and
a different one on Jenna?

25:49.919 --> 25:51.621
Any progress?

25:56.956 --> 26:00.690
There is some
material in the wound.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.093
I need you to... test it?

26:05.094 --> 26:07.597
Yes. Yes. Sure.
Yeah. Oh, uh, sorry.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.641
Early night?

26:12.642 --> 26:15.644
I'll have my cell with
me if you need me.

26:15.645 --> 26:18.977
Let me guess. The ballet?

26:18.978 --> 26:21.079
I know that Todd's firm

26:21.080 --> 26:23.081
has box seats at the academy.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.254
Actually, we're going
to a gallery opening.

26:26.255 --> 26:28.357
He can be charming.

26:32.662 --> 26:36.324
Todd is good man.

26:36.325 --> 26:39.128
Let's just leave it at charming.

26:41.671 --> 26:45.303
Look, I'm sorry. I know
this is hard for you.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.806
(Chuckles)

26:47.807 --> 26:49.808
But this relationship
is happening,

26:49.809 --> 26:53.743
and the sooner you can
come to terms with it, the better.

27:01.751 --> 27:05.694
(Video playing without audio)

27:05.695 --> 27:07.757
(Clicks)

27:11.030 --> 27:13.031
From the donut spot,

27:13.032 --> 27:15.033
in honor of Jenna.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.035
My favorite is the
bavarian cream.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.037
It's the best in
the city, bar none.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.840
Good call.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.212
Ah.

27:24.213 --> 27:25.845
Mmm.

27:27.216 --> 27:30.078
Heard you used to be a cop.

27:30.079 --> 27:32.821
How'd you end up
in the m.E.'S office?

27:32.822 --> 27:34.322
I got shot,

27:34.323 --> 27:36.885
so all that time in rehab,

27:36.886 --> 27:38.887
I realized that I
enjoyed medicine.

27:38.888 --> 27:41.930
Working in the m.E.'S office
is the best of both worlds. Mm.

27:41.931 --> 27:44.062
How about you?
I got ray to blame.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.435
He kinda took me under
his wing at the fire academy.

27:47.436 --> 27:49.938
The instructors started calling
me skipeaston. (Chuckles)

27:49.939 --> 27:52.440
(Laughs) The guy
basically adopted me,

27:52.441 --> 27:54.973
and we've been
like family ever since.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.346
(Click)

27:59.809 --> 28:01.750
(Click) Did you see that?

28:01.751 --> 28:03.912
What? Daniel Robinson?

28:03.913 --> 28:05.854
No.

28:05.855 --> 28:08.686
(Click)

28:08.687 --> 28:11.821
Daniel Robinson's
daughter... Emily.

28:23.272 --> 28:25.774
We watched over three
hours of surveillance video.

28:25.775 --> 28:28.276
Only one person had
no business being there.

28:28.277 --> 28:29.778
You.

28:29.779 --> 28:33.281
And Jenna died of
cyanide poisoning.

28:33.282 --> 28:35.413
Now cyanide is
difficult to come by.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.747
Well, unless your
dad has a chem lab.

28:38.748 --> 28:40.248
I didn't poison Jenna.

28:40.249 --> 28:42.751
When she showed up
at my house that night,

28:42.752 --> 28:44.753
my dad didn't know I was home.

28:44.754 --> 28:46.755
I... I heard them talk.

28:46.756 --> 28:49.257
He was such a jerk to her.

28:49.258 --> 28:53.231
I thought, you know, maybe
if I showed up at the hospital,

28:53.232 --> 28:55.733
I could bring her some peace.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.407
"Bring her some peace"?
That's all you've got?

28:59.408 --> 29:02.270
I swear!

29:02.271 --> 29:05.374
(Voice breaks) I wanted
a sister my whole life.

29:07.116 --> 29:09.117
I-I tried to talk to her

29:09.118 --> 29:11.780
that night at the house.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.281
But she just...

29:13.282 --> 29:15.784
Took off running
toward Anderson park,

29:15.785 --> 29:17.426
crying.

29:29.538 --> 29:32.871
(Police radio chatter)

29:32.872 --> 29:34.873
My daughter didn't do this.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.375
I don't understand why
you won't leave us alone.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.378
What, just like you wanted
Jenna and Ben to leave you alone?

29:40.379 --> 29:43.252
You have no right to judge me.

29:49.158 --> 29:51.490
(Sighs)

29:52.992 --> 29:56.165
Why did you give Jenna up?

29:58.497 --> 30:01.469
Because I was 17

30:01.470 --> 30:05.473
and completely unprepared
for the responsibility.

30:05.474 --> 30:09.008
Jenna's mother wanted to leave
her in a gas station bathroom.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.181
(Sighs)

30:13.182 --> 30:16.514
I brought her to
the police station.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.017
I spent the last money I had

30:19.018 --> 30:20.518
on a t-shirt

30:20.519 --> 30:23.291
and, uh, and a toy,

30:23.292 --> 30:26.855
and I left her there
with a stuffed animal,

30:26.856 --> 30:29.458
so she wouldn't be alone.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.862
Was that toy

30:33.863 --> 30:36.334
a stuffed turtle?

30:36.335 --> 30:40.038
How could you
possibly know that?

30:40.039 --> 30:41.870
(Sighs)

30:41.871 --> 30:44.172
Because when I
found Jenna in the fire,

30:44.173 --> 30:46.875
she was holding it.

30:46.876 --> 30:48.176
Of all her possessions,

30:48.177 --> 30:50.949
that's the one thing that
she tried to save. (Chuckles)

30:50.950 --> 30:54.052
(Sighs) She kept it
with her all these years?

30:54.053 --> 30:55.583
(Peter) Yes.

30:55.584 --> 30:57.855
I just wish

30:57.856 --> 31:01.860
you'd given her the
chance to tell you herself.

31:03.432 --> 31:04.934
(Slaps leg)

31:19.248 --> 31:20.548
Where's bud?

31:20.549 --> 31:23.251
He's at south station
with septa security

31:23.252 --> 31:26.254
trying to see whether or not
Jenna was at the train station

31:26.255 --> 31:29.257
the night of the fire. So
what are we doing here?

31:29.258 --> 31:31.259
Well, to the west
is Anderson park.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.261
To the east, south station.

31:33.262 --> 31:35.563
Emily Robinson said
Jenna went towards the park.

31:35.564 --> 31:38.566
Okay. We know Jenna took
the train to Daniel's house.

31:38.567 --> 31:41.930
Now she would've had
to take the 8:46 train back

31:41.931 --> 31:44.933
in order for Peter to
find her in the living room.

31:44.934 --> 31:47.936
Which means either
Emily got it wrong or...

31:47.937 --> 31:51.940
Or somebody gave
Jenna a ride home.

31:51.941 --> 31:54.282
I wonder what happened here.

31:54.283 --> 31:56.484
Hmm. Fire?

31:56.485 --> 31:58.516
Ray said he was
looking for somebody

31:58.517 --> 32:02.120
who's been torching toy stores.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.924
And Jenna stepped in wet paint.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.028
She was here.

32:10.029 --> 32:14.202
Let's take a look
inside, shall we?

32:14.203 --> 32:15.703
(Door opens)

32:15.704 --> 32:18.307
(Sighs)

32:21.340 --> 32:23.641
You want to tell us
what happened here?

32:23.642 --> 32:26.074
Uh, it's just a
small electrical fire.

32:26.075 --> 32:28.616
Looks like your sprinklers
went off. Did p.F.D. Respond?

32:28.617 --> 32:31.619
It was such a small fire.
Uh, no need for firefighters.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.951
Besides, when I got here,

32:33.952 --> 32:36.684
the sprinklers had
already, uh, put it out.

32:36.685 --> 32:39.557
Something wrong?

32:39.558 --> 32:42.630
We should call ray.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.133
(Cell phone beeps)

32:46.635 --> 32:49.267
What is that?

32:49.268 --> 32:50.738
Uh, looks...

32:50.739 --> 32:53.372
Looks like a Cannon fuse.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.378
A Cannon fuse?

33:00.379 --> 33:03.381
Yeah, you know, for, um,
hobby rockets, that sort of thing.

33:03.382 --> 33:07.155
But I don't carry those here in
my store. (Lowered voice) What?

33:07.156 --> 33:09.657
(Lowered voice) Ray
Easton has a Cannon.

33:09.658 --> 33:13.161
Geraldine. He fires it off
to celebrate closing a case.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.663
Are you trying to
tell me ray did this?

33:15.664 --> 33:18.166
Maybe he's such a
good arson investigator

33:18.167 --> 33:20.668
because he's the one
lighting the damn fire.

33:20.669 --> 33:23.472
(Sighs)

33:32.341 --> 33:36.044
Has anyone evenseen
ray Easton's fire evidence?

33:36.045 --> 33:38.046
When I got to the
applebee house,

33:38.047 --> 33:40.488
he would not let
me move Ben's body

33:40.489 --> 33:42.490
until he worked the
scene by himself,

33:42.491 --> 33:44.322
and then he dragged his heels

33:44.323 --> 33:47.355
when he was processing the rest
of the house. You're talking about

33:47.356 --> 33:49.357
the p.F.D.'S most
decorated arson investigator.

33:49.358 --> 33:52.630
I'm not gonna bring him
in based on your hunch

33:52.631 --> 33:55.633
and a half-burnt piece of string. You arrested
Mike applebee over a broken vodka bottle.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.505
And I was wrong!

33:57.506 --> 34:00.468
Excuse me if I don't want to repeat
the experience. All right, how about

34:00.469 --> 34:02.770
you worry about Jenna
applebee instead of yourself?

34:02.771 --> 34:05.343
Dr. Hunt's helped you
close more than a few cases.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.346
I wouldn't be so quick to
discount what she says.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.348
Now what about the blunt
force trauma weapon?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.350
Can you connect
that to ray Easton?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.352
I recovered some trace
from Jenna's wound.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.354
Uh, Ethan verified
that it's leather,

34:16.355 --> 34:19.087
but Jenna's wound and
Ben's are very different,

34:19.088 --> 34:21.389
so we're looking for one
leather-bound weapon

34:21.390 --> 34:23.391
that can create two
different impressions

34:23.392 --> 34:25.733
and is approximately
the same size

34:25.734 --> 34:27.735
as Mike applebee's book weight.

34:27.736 --> 34:30.438
I don't know what that is.

34:30.439 --> 34:32.671
I do.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.474
It's a sap.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.447
It gets passed down
through cop families.

34:39.448 --> 34:42.110
Can I see that?

34:42.111 --> 34:44.112
Nothing is better
to protect yourself

34:44.113 --> 34:46.184
in a close-range fight.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.187
Or to knock someone
out before you start a fire.

34:49.188 --> 34:53.221
Ray comes from
a cop family, right?

34:53.222 --> 34:55.463
So maybe he has a sap as well.

34:55.464 --> 34:58.226
Didn't you say you worked
with his father in the badlands?

34:58.227 --> 35:00.828
Yeah. He had a sap.

35:00.829 --> 35:02.770
Make a call.

35:02.771 --> 35:04.772
I'll inform the mayor
and the fire chief

35:04.773 --> 35:06.834
so they don't get
blindsided by this.

35:06.835 --> 35:09.837
(Door opens) While you
guys talk to the big fish,

35:09.838 --> 35:12.380
I'll reach out to, uh, skip

35:12.381 --> 35:15.213
and see what I
can get out of him.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.515
(Door closes)

35:25.454 --> 35:28.457
One weapon...

35:39.137 --> 35:41.340
Two wounds.

35:47.276 --> 35:51.549
I heard about your
little investigation.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.182
Huh. (Exhales deeply)

35:54.183 --> 35:56.654
When you said you
wanted to hang out,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.686
I figured beers
would be involved.

35:58.687 --> 36:01.389
This toy store was
almost the latest casualty

36:01.390 --> 36:02.690
of your serial arsonist.

36:02.691 --> 36:05.263
Really? Yeah.

36:05.264 --> 36:08.196
Why weren't ray and I called?

36:08.197 --> 36:11.399
Because we recovered a
piece of the incendiary device.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.700
Cannon fuse.

36:12.701 --> 36:16.344
Hold on a sec. You
think ray was involved?

36:16.345 --> 36:19.208
The idea that I'm
responsible is absurd.

36:20.509 --> 36:23.381
Oh, is it? (Chuckles)

36:23.382 --> 36:26.684
We found Cannon
fuse at a toy store fire.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.756
Honestly, this looks
more like insurance fraud

36:28.757 --> 36:30.918
than serial arson.

36:30.919 --> 36:33.191
Except that the owner
didn't file a claim.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.869
This looks like Jenna's
turtle. (Chuckles)

36:42.631 --> 36:44.632
That toy store was a block away

36:44.633 --> 36:47.305
from where Daniel
Robinson lives. So what?

36:47.306 --> 36:50.638
So your Cannon fuse usually
gave you time to escape,

36:50.639 --> 36:52.940
only this time the
alarm went off early,

36:52.941 --> 36:55.583
and that's when Jenna
applebee saw you.

36:55.584 --> 36:58.686
Look, did... hey.

36:58.687 --> 37:00.788
How did you know

37:00.789 --> 37:03.551
that Jenna had a stuffed turtle?

37:03.552 --> 37:06.894
I logged it as
evidence at the house.

37:06.895 --> 37:09.857
No, you didn't.

37:09.858 --> 37:13.631
I saw it burn in the fire.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.633
So what are you saying?

37:15.634 --> 37:17.965
You've got one of
these, don't you?

37:17.966 --> 37:20.668
You used it on Jenna,
you used it on Ben,

37:20.669 --> 37:23.311
and then you burned her
house down to cover your tracks.

37:23.312 --> 37:26.544
Then when Jenna doesn't die,
you poisoned her in the hospital

37:26.545 --> 37:29.617
to finish her off. Are you sure a
sap was used in these attacks?

37:29.618 --> 37:31.519
(Whispers) Oh, yeah.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.552
Getting my sap was a big deal.

37:34.553 --> 37:37.855
(Voice breaks) When my
father retired, he gave it to me.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.388
I don't have any kids,

37:40.389 --> 37:42.930
so when skip
passed his level ii's,

37:42.931 --> 37:45.763
I gave it to him.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.596
He was proud.

37:48.597 --> 37:50.267
I was prouder.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.969
You gave it to skip?

37:51.970 --> 37:54.402
(Whispers) Yeah.

37:54.403 --> 37:58.275
Peter's in trouble.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.778
I'm saying that you
couldn't have known

38:00.779 --> 38:02.710
unless you got there before me.

38:02.711 --> 38:06.454
(Chuckles) I think you've been
pulling too many all-nighters.

38:06.455 --> 38:08.656
Hey! (Grunts)

38:08.657 --> 38:11.359
(Grunts)

38:11.360 --> 38:13.361
(Both panting)

38:13.362 --> 38:14.822
(Cocks gun)

38:14.823 --> 38:17.965
I think you've played the
hero enough, don't you think?

38:17.966 --> 38:21.499
I'm just gonna walk out of here.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.631
(Door slams open)
I don't think so.

38:23.632 --> 38:25.773
(Sam) Drop the gun. Now.

38:25.774 --> 38:27.975
Skip, it's over.

38:27.976 --> 38:30.438
Drop it!

38:30.439 --> 38:31.779
(Grunts)

38:31.780 --> 38:34.812
Hands on your head.
You got him, partner?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.384
Yeah.

38:36.385 --> 38:39.687
Jenna recognized skip
from the donut spot.

38:39.688 --> 38:41.549
Where she worked?

38:41.550 --> 38:44.321
Yeah. Skip was a regular.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.823
His favorite was bavarian cream.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.526
"Best in the city, bar none,"
right? (Handcuffs click)

38:48.527 --> 38:50.828
So it wasn't just the
alarm that stopped her.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.661
She saw somebody she
knew coming out of here.

38:53.662 --> 38:56.664
(Alarm ringing)

38:56.665 --> 38:58.406
Skip?

38:58.407 --> 39:00.668
Jenna? What's going on here?

39:00.669 --> 39:03.671
(Megan) She knew you worked for the fire department.
Just running some tests. Nothing to worry about.

39:03.672 --> 39:06.474
You told her
everything was okay.

39:06.475 --> 39:09.377
You even offered
her a ride home.

39:09.378 --> 39:11.749
That was her mistake.
She trusted you.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.121
And I made the same mistake.

39:14.122 --> 39:15.853
I'm sorry, ray.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.855
I-I'm so sorry.

39:17.856 --> 39:23.592
(Sighs)

39:32.741 --> 39:34.742
Three generations of Easton men

39:34.743 --> 39:38.046
have carried this sap,
and now it's evidence?

39:40.479 --> 39:43.411
I'll make sure it gets
right back to you.

39:43.412 --> 39:45.753
Don't bother.

39:45.754 --> 39:48.155
Ray, you can't blame yourself.

39:48.156 --> 39:50.758
He knew your methodology,
your investigative process.

39:50.759 --> 39:54.862
Well, fortunately
he didn't know yours.

39:54.863 --> 39:57.725
I'm gonna go fire Geraldine.

39:57.726 --> 40:01.769
I'm sorry, ray.

40:01.770 --> 40:04.031
Yeah. (Chuckles)

40:04.032 --> 40:05.734
Yeah. Me, too.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.778
You okay?

40:10.779 --> 40:12.780
Do you mind if I come in

40:12.781 --> 40:15.142
a little late tomorrow morning? No, not
with what you've been through this week.

40:15.143 --> 40:17.144
I'll cover for you with Kate.

40:17.145 --> 40:19.146
Oh, maybe I should come in.

40:19.147 --> 40:21.849
I mean, the less you two
talk, the better, you know?

40:21.850 --> 40:24.151
(Chuckles) I have been
very professional. (Chuckles)

40:24.152 --> 40:26.153
Semiprofessional. (Chuckles)

40:26.154 --> 40:30.798
We've caught the man
responsible for Ben's murder.

40:30.799 --> 40:32.099
His name...

40:32.100 --> 40:33.801
Please don't. (Chuckles)

40:33.802 --> 40:35.803
I don't want that name

40:35.804 --> 40:38.806
to be the last thing that
I associate with Ben.

40:38.807 --> 40:40.107
But thank you.

40:40.108 --> 40:43.110
Sure.

40:43.111 --> 40:45.873
Ms. Armstrong, I...

40:45.874 --> 40:48.846
I know the timing
couldn't be worse, but, uh,

40:48.847 --> 40:50.848
working on Ben's
case has stirred up

40:50.849 --> 40:52.850
a lot of questions about
where I come from.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.622
You were adopted?

40:54.623 --> 40:57.625
I don't know what your plans are

40:57.626 --> 40:58.926
for families reconnected,

40:58.927 --> 41:01.659
but I was hoping

41:01.660 --> 41:03.961
that you'd help me
find my birth parents.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.834
Ben wouldn't have
it any other way.

41:06.835 --> 41:08.837
(Chuckles)

41:17.646 --> 41:20.047
You wanted to see me?

41:20.048 --> 41:22.850
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.

41:22.851 --> 41:25.883
Heard they, uh,
arrested skip rakoski.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.885
If you hadn't had
my back with bud,

41:27.886 --> 41:30.618
we never would've
found out about skip.

41:30.619 --> 41:32.591
That's my job.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.567
How was the gallery opening?

41:41.169 --> 41:44.932
Ahem. Um, honestly, not great.

41:44.933 --> 41:47.535
I guess I can add fine art

41:47.536 --> 41:49.837
to the list of things
that don't interest Todd.

41:49.838 --> 41:51.739
Try bowling next time.

41:51.740 --> 41:52.910
Bowling?

41:52.911 --> 41:56.043
The man likes stale
nachos and rented shoes.

41:56.044 --> 41:58.916
It's a mystery why
we never worked out.

41:58.917 --> 42:02.550
Okay. Well, thanks for the tip.

42:02.551 --> 42:05.853
So... are we good?

42:05.854 --> 42:07.555
You were right.

42:07.556 --> 42:10.197
Your relationship with
Todd is happening.

42:10.198 --> 42:13.901
We just won't be
double-dating any time soon.

42:13.902 --> 42:15.603
No, well, that would imply

42:15.604 --> 42:17.605
that you'd actually
go on a date.

42:17.606 --> 42:20.808
Well, maybe you could set me
up with someone, like your brother.

42:20.809 --> 42:23.611
(Both laugh)

42:23.612 --> 42:27.214
I'll see you at the
staff meeting, Dr. Hunt.

42:27.215 --> 42:32.280
Yes, you will, Dr. Murphy.
