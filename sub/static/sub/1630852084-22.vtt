since I've been around here

16:13.840 --> 16:17.844
just tip-toe around them.
But y'all got to be the parent.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.147
So you need to sit her down
and open up the communication

16:21.247 --> 16:24.584
so she can tell you
what's going on.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.153
All right? Have you
tried just talking to her?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.655
- Yes.
- Several times.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.023
- Oh, I know.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.925
You know, raising
teenagers, it can be hard.

16:32.025 --> 16:32.992
I know that.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.428
- BOTH: [grunting]

16:35.562 --> 16:37.597
- But she's had an attitude
around here for a while.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.932
I've seen it.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.701
I wish I would've walked
around like that with my momma.

16:41.801 --> 16:46.873
Baby, she would've knocked
me clear across this room.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.108
Yeah, that's the
kind of momma I had.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.276
I know y'all not
that kind of parents.

16:50.377 --> 16:54.647
I wish I would've
had attitude, mm!

16:54.748 --> 16:57.617
Listen, I've been working with
young people for a long time.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.320
As soon as you give them the
liberty to do what they want

17:00.420 --> 17:02.856
when they want
and how they wanna do it,

17:02.956 --> 17:05.592
they will run over you.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.062
Right now, you need to
put her back in her place.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.564
That's my personal opinion
for her own safety,

17:11.664 --> 17:13.266
'cause right now,
it's kind of scary

17:13.366 --> 17:15.969
'cause we don't know
what she's doing.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.905
But it is your
responsibility to find out.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.642
- Well...we can find out.
- You can?

17:22.742 --> 17:25.679
- JEREMY: Yeah.
- Okay, so...what you mean?

17:25.779 --> 17:29.582
- Well, we have this app that
lets us look at her phone

17:29.683 --> 17:31.985
so we can see
all her text messages.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.955
- Oh, really? Well...

17:36.056 --> 17:39.426
- But Mr. Jeremy feels like
we're invading her privacy.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.229
- Well, I can see why.
- So you think so too?

17:43.329 --> 17:46.066
- A little bit,
a little bit, you know?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.802
I can see her point.
I can see your point.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.037
But I don't know if
that's a good idea, though.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.605
- I agree.
- Okay.

17:52.706 --> 17:53.907
- Well, you raised her.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.408
Now y'all just
have to trust her.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.777
- We do trust her.
We trust her.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.813
- But y'all know your daughter.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.116
Just follow your heart
and just jump in there.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.718
You know, ask the Lord
to give you what to say.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.454
That's all I can tell you, baby.
That's all I can tell you.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.957
- JEREMY: Well,
Miss Cora, thank you.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.258
- You're welcome.
You know what?

18:12.359 --> 18:14.194
I'm gonna get in the back
and check on them other two

18:14.294 --> 18:17.063
before they kill themselves.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.298
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.735
Oh!
- Where you going?

18:21.835 --> 18:22.902
- Hm?
- CORA: Yeah!

18:23.002 --> 18:25.839
You supposed to be here,
talking to your wife!

18:25.939 --> 18:28.241
- [growls]

18:28.341 --> 18:29.542
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.845
It's gonna work out, y'all.
It's gonna work out.

18:33.013 --> 18:34.914
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

18:35.015 --> 18:36.216
You don't wanna do this, huh?

18:36.316 --> 18:39.552
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.121
- All right, so we're
not gonna do it?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.655
Okay, good.
- I'm gonna do it.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.894
- You really gonna do this?
- Yes.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.429
- Okay, fine.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.564
- And I'm not gonna
tell you what I find.

18:51.598 --> 18:55.035
- I don't wanna know.
- Well, go on, then.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.369
- Hey, I'm going.
- Uh-huh.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.139
- I'm going right here.
- Oh! Oh!

18:59.239 --> 19:01.207
Why? Why you
wanna stay here now?

19:01.307 --> 19:04.244
- Somebody gotta keep watch.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.046
- So you can try to
read what I find?

19:06.146 --> 19:09.349
- No, I'm trying to protect you,
because if she come in here,

19:09.449 --> 19:11.217
it's gonna be a problem.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.789
- This is my kid, not
the other way around.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.257
I'm the momma.

19:17.357 --> 19:21.528
- Heh, yeah, but
y'all act just alike.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.664
- We do not act alike.
Would you stop saying that?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.701
- Yeah. She would've
said that right now.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.903
Same exact lines.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.006
- Well, I'm right, okay?
So go on.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.542
- Nope, nope.
I'm standing right here.

19:37.077 --> 19:38.078
I'm just gonna look at it.
