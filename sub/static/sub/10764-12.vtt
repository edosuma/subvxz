00:02.402 --> 00:05.371
"And so the men and women
of Plymouth Colony...

00:05.438 --> 00:09.204
"sat at a long table
with their new-found Indian friends...

00:09.275 --> 00:11.743
"to celebrate the first Thanksgiving.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.803
"And at the head of the table,
the leader of the pilgrims...

00:14.881 --> 00:17.975
"folded his hands,
bowed his head and said..."

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:28.762 --> 00:32.162
And then the village idiot
interrupted the prayer...

00:33.266 --> 00:35.734
ruining the feast for one and all.

00:37.270 --> 00:40.068
Boy, holiday traffic is starting already.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.506
People are in such a lousy mood.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.066
I learned five new words on the way home.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.136
- Did you know what they meant?
- I think so.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.182
They were accompanied
by very helpful hand gestures.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.616
Will, I bet you can't wait
till your mom gets here.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.711
Yeah. Thanks for flying her out, Aunt Viv.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.657
We had to convince her to accept it.
She never lets us spend a penny on her.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.388
Apparently, that's not a genetic trait.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.854
Now, for Thanksgiving...

01:05.932 --> 01:08.992
do you want to try something different
or the traditional turkey?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.367
Mother, I have a big problem with turkey.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.632
What's wrong with it?

01:12.705 --> 01:16.266
From the moment they're hatched
to the moment they're shrink-wrapped...

01:16.342 --> 01:19.470
turkeys are raised to be food,
and nothing but food.

01:19.612 --> 01:22.672
Hilary, I don't think too
many of them had aspirations...

01:22.749 --> 01:24.774
to be doctors or lawyers.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.619
My sister should be here any minute.
Aren't you excited?

02:39.692 --> 02:44.186
Yeah, I can't wait till she gets out here
and starts taking her usual shots at me.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.822
Vi's that way with everybody.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.799
Remember what she said about my beard?

02:47.867 --> 02:49.164
You misunderstood.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.533
She said it made me look like Bigfoot.

02:53.706 --> 02:57.233
Which is ridiculous, because nobody
knows what Bigfoot really looks like.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.771
That's her. Come on.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.049
- Mom!
- Baby!

03:10.456 --> 03:11.923
Goodness gracious!

03:12.825 --> 03:15.350
Viv, come on, give us a hug!

03:16.062 --> 03:19.361
Look at my boy. You really have changed.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.195
Yeah, I'm handsome.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.492
No, you haven't changed.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.966
I hope he's not eating you
out of house and home?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.529
Not at all.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.402
He's certainly not taking any food
out of your mouth.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.172
Starting already. I don't believe it.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.407
That's a good one, Mama.
I got to use that one.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.848
No, you don't make fun of your uncle.
That's my job.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.449
Come on, let's go inside.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.988
- Girl, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.614
How's everything at the post office?

03:44.691 --> 03:47.125
- They made me a supervisor.
- That's wonderful.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.957
Honey, they make everybody
at the post office a supervisor.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.294
You practically have to eat the mail
not to get promoted.

03:54.100 --> 03:58.127
- Aunt Vi.
- My goodness, aren't you handsome?

03:58.204 --> 04:01.571
And looking less and less
like your daddy every day.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.668
Ouch. Run for cover, Dad.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.042
Where's he going to hide at?

04:09.315 --> 04:12.876
Vi, this is Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, my sister-in-law, Mrs. Smith.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.318
- How do you do?
- I'm fine, thank you.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.616
Mom, check this.

04:16.689 --> 04:19.317
Geoffrey, take my mom's bags
to her room.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.387
What did I do?

04:22.095 --> 04:25.861
You can take those bags yourself.
That man is twice your age.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.962
Even though he doesn't look it.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.762
At least take the heavy one. Now go on.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.864
- But, Mom...
- You heard me.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.280
After you, Master William.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.411
Carlton, go tell your sisters
their aunt is here.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.147
Y'all tell me,
has Will been giving you any trouble?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.485
He's been wonderful, hasn't he, Philip?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.824
Let's just say he takes after you, Vi.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.422
Okay.

04:58.498 --> 05:02.559
Vi, I was dusting the albums this morning
and guess what I found.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.500
Certainly not dust.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.167
The Temptations!

05:11.244 --> 05:12.643
Girl, I have that album.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.077
You had it. I borrowed it.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.172
You taught me to dance to this,
remember?

05:17.216 --> 05:19.912
I didn't teach you to dance like that.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.981
- Move over, girlfriend.
- Look out.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.318
- Aunt Vi!
- My girls!

05:30.396 --> 05:33.194
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you. Come on. Dance with us.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.394
Here we go. All right.
Here you go. That's right.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.231
What dance is this?

05:39.305 --> 05:43.036
It's called the swim, Ashley.
It was very popular in the 1940s.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.014
The 1960s, and it's not the swim.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.709
Your daddy knows how to swim.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.047
Come on. Swim for her. Come on, Philip.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.183
Everybody out of the pool.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.041
That cobbler was delicious.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.639
The person that invented
the elastic waistband...

06:23.716 --> 06:25.707
should get the Nobel Prize.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.379
- You know what I mean...
- Don't start.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.089
Mom, you know who used to make
the best cobbler?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.887
Old lady Ivory down the street.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.157
- Does she still make it?
- Honey, she passed on.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.166
- You're kidding.
- Child, she was in her early 100s.

06:43.403 --> 06:48.067
You'd have never known by the way
she used to swing that baseball bat at me.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.735
Can we have a moment of silence?

06:51.511 --> 06:52.808
Yeah, well.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.016
Mom, Dad, I have a little favor.

06:58.084 --> 07:02.180
My English teacher doesn't have anywhere
to go for Thanksgiving tomorrow...

07:02.255 --> 07:05.782
and I just thought, since he's all alone,
and we have so much to share...

07:05.858 --> 07:07.223
could we invite him to dinner?

07:07.293 --> 07:09.261
Certainly, Carlton. That's very thoughtful.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.764
And not the worst way
to pull my grade up to an "A."

07:13.132 --> 07:15.100
This sure was lovely.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.433
- No, Mom, I'll get that for you.
- Thank you, babe.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.069
Geoffrey!

07:22.375 --> 07:23.706
Mom, what did I do?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.711
It's all right, Viola,
Geoffrey clears the table. It's his job.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.043
You shouted, Master William?

07:29.816 --> 07:30.908
Yes, Geoffrey.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.510
Why don't you have a seat and have
some of this delicious peach cobbler...

07:34.587 --> 07:37.556
- while we clear the table.
- Don't go through so much trouble.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.787
No trouble at all.
Hilary, Carlton, Ashley, and you...

07:41.861 --> 07:45.058
Your Highness, let us all clear the table.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.328
That's a good one.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.869
Honey, do I look like I'm telling a joke?

07:52.939 --> 07:54.429
Not to me.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.304
Don't just sit there watching.

07:58.377 --> 08:01.369
Pick up the dishes
and get them into the kitchen.

08:01.447 --> 08:02.914
Now hustle.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.984
Some guest.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.214
What should I do with these bowls?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.658
Just put them in the dishwasher.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.924
Here?

08:21.167 --> 08:25.433
Let's just take them up to Geoffrey's room.
He'll know what to do with them.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.032
Lord, have mercy. Just leave them here.
I'll take care of them.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.975
Now, go on.

08:31.711 --> 08:35.647
Honestly, I've never seen
such a lazy bunch in my life...

08:35.715 --> 08:37.945
and I work at the post office.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.888
- Yo, Jesse!
- How's it going, Will?

08:48.628 --> 08:51.119
Mom, this is my man Jesse.
He does the gardening here.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.528
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

08:52.598 --> 08:55.624
Is your aunt around?
I want to know where to plant the bushes.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.692
I think she said she wanted them
by the pool.

08:57.770 --> 08:58.998
Could you do me a favor?

08:59.071 --> 09:02.165
My mom really likes roses.
Can you snip a couple for her bedroom?

09:02.241 --> 09:04.607
- No problem.
- Wait a second.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.070
Honey, don't go bossing him around.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.979
If you want to cut me some flowers,
you go get them yourself.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.483
- But, Mom...
- Understand?

09:12.885 --> 09:15.854
Okay, I'll cut you
the most beautiful bouquet in the world...

09:15.922 --> 09:19.221
but its beauty will pale
in comparison to yours.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.292
Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.

09:23.362 --> 09:27.128
Jesse, listen, it's the day before
Thanksgiving. Take the day off.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.563
Thanks.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.535
You going to be around here
for Christmas?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.701
Jesse! Good, I wanted to talk to you
about the bushes.

09:36.776 --> 09:40.109
We can talk about it next week.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.913
Is Jesse leaving?

09:42.648 --> 09:44.548
He didn't mow the lawn.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.448
Mom gave him the day off.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.952
What?

09:48.020 --> 09:51.148
It's a holiday. It'll be cool
if the grass grows for another week.

09:51.223 --> 09:54.386
No. It's not growing
'cause you going to cut it.

09:56.562 --> 09:57.824
Why me?

09:58.898 --> 10:02.459
You always mowed the lawn back home.
I don't see why can't you do this one.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.470
'Cause it's the size of a football field!

10:06.572 --> 10:09.200
Since when do I have to ask you twice?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.266
- But, Mom...
- Now hustle.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.378
Okay, but I ain't going to cut you
no flowers.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.216
You should have talked to me before
letting the gardener take the day off.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.123
It's the day before Thanksgiving.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.628
It was a nice idea,
but it's the same thing...

10:30.696 --> 10:33.324
with telling Geoffrey not to clear the table.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.697
I just think
that they might feel uncomfortable...

10:35.768 --> 10:38.328
taking orders from somebody
they don't know.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.139
And they'd rather take orders
from a 17-year-old boy?

10:42.341 --> 10:44.002
What do you mean?

10:44.076 --> 10:46.601
Honey, I don't mean to be critical...

10:46.679 --> 10:48.977
but I don't like what I saw today.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.814
Will's got a bunch of grown men
doing all the work he should be doing.

10:52.885 --> 10:56.685
I haven't seen him lift a finger
except to scratch his head.

10:57.089 --> 11:00.547
You're not being fair, Vi.
Will works very hard at his homework.

11:00.626 --> 11:04.118
Back home, Will did his homework,
mowed the lawn, raked the leaves...

11:04.196 --> 11:05.925
and cleared the table.

11:05.998 --> 11:10.492
I don't think a little work around the house
is gonna interfere with his education.

11:11.470 --> 11:15.304
From what I see,
all he's learning is how to be a rich kid.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.105
Philip and I just want Will to have
the same advantages that our kids have.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.373
Isn't that why you sent him out here?

11:21.714 --> 11:25.480
I sent him out here to stay out of trouble
and get a good education.

11:25.551 --> 11:29.783
But, Vivian, I also taught that boy
the value of hard work...

11:29.855 --> 11:32.323
and I don't want him to lose that.

11:33.092 --> 11:37.188
All I know is the kids in this house
are getting a free ride...

11:37.263 --> 11:39.390
a free ride in a fancy car.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.899
But I don't mean to be critical.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.805
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No. All done.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.705
Vivian, since Carlton's
invited his teacher...

11:50.776 --> 11:54.906
maybe you should call the caterers and
tell them there'll be one more for dinner.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.281
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fine.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.718
Do you know what my sister just said?

12:04.023 --> 12:05.752
You are not gonna believe this.

12:05.825 --> 12:09.261
- She said that our kids are spoiled.
- News flash.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.860
You mean you agree with her?

12:14.934 --> 12:17.528
I keep saying they should
do more work around the house.

12:17.603 --> 12:21.095
- You're the one who's too easy on them.
- Really? Does this sound familiar?

12:21.173 --> 12:23.505
"Daddy, I need $300."

12:27.980 --> 12:30.312
You don't have to get personal.

12:30.382 --> 12:34.148
Vi just made an honest criticism.
Let's just leave it at that.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.620
You really think
I've been too easy on them.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.715
Honey, we're not going
to solve this overnight.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.625
Look, let's just have
a pleasant Thanksgiving tomorrow...

12:42.695 --> 12:45.858
and we can talk about it
after Vi leaves, okay?

12:47.299 --> 12:49.790
Don't forget to call the caterer.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.979
Hello, Sally? This is Vivian Banks.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.483
You had us scheduled
for a Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.182
We'd like to cancel it.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.555
We're going to have the kids make dinner.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.924
What do you mean, good luck?

13:23.869 --> 13:27.828
Will, Carlton, Hilary, Ashley!
Get down here! Hustle!

13:30.042 --> 13:33.068
- Did you get the turkey?
- Certainly, madam.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.879
Geoffrey, it's frozen solid.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.940
Really, madam?
I thought it was just scared.

13:41.287 --> 13:45.053
Mommy, didn't we just
have a fire drill last week?

13:45.357 --> 13:47.416
- This is not a drill.
- It's a fire?

13:47.493 --> 13:51.657
My God, I'm going back for
my new suede boots. Don't try to stop me.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.563
While you're up there,
get my lucky drawers!

13:55.367 --> 13:58.359
You are going to cook and serve
Thanksgiving dinner.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.064
- How?
- Why?

14:00.139 --> 14:02.835
Because you kids don't do enough work
around the house.

14:02.908 --> 14:06.275
Excuse me?
Didn't I just mow Central Park yesterday?

14:07.813 --> 14:10.407
Mom, my English teacher
is coming to dinner.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.950
He holds my English grade
in the palm of his hand.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.010
This is not the time
for one of your leftist experiments.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.386
Carlton's right, Mom.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.856
This stuff about us working
could really wait.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.123
It has a real
New Year's resolution feel to it.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.265
I do not want to discuss this.

14:27.366 --> 14:31.097
- Since when do I have to ask you twice?
- Every time, Mommy.

14:32.338 --> 14:33.862
Well, not this time.

14:33.939 --> 14:38.308
You've got 15 minutes to get up,
get dressed, and get back down here.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.776
Move it!

14:42.948 --> 14:47.510
Instead of doing all this work, shouldn't I
be spending some time with my mom?

14:47.586 --> 14:50.248
I mean, she sees me so little...

14:50.322 --> 14:52.620
and I'm growing so fast.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.825
Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.386
Your mother did not send you out here
on vacation.

14:58.464 --> 15:02.594
And so far, you've been getting a free ride,
a free ride in a fancy car.

15:05.537 --> 15:09.098
And if you really want to do
something nice for your mother...

15:09.174 --> 15:11.608
why don't you show her
you can do some work here?

15:11.677 --> 15:14.237
- But, Aunt Viv...
- No discussion.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.812
Do you realize
there's a bump forming back there?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.846
All right, these are your assignments.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.790
I'll do the turkey.
Ashley, you do the cranberry sauce.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.159
Carlton, you do the stuffing.
Hilary, you do the yams and the rolls.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.595
I get two things?

15:32.665 --> 15:36.931
Why don't you just put a yoke
around my neck and hitch me to a plow?

15:41.140 --> 15:44.234
Hilary, I don't think it would be
the worst thing in the world...

15:44.310 --> 15:46.244
if you guys did some work around here.

15:46.312 --> 15:50.112
I mean, you guys are getting a fancy ride,
a fancy ride in a free car.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.878
I'm sorry dinner's so late, Mr. Fellows.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.389
That's okay.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.221
I think in our society,
we're too obsessed with time.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.592
Save time. Don't waste time. Be on time.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.460
What are we in such a hurry to do?

16:06.532 --> 16:07.794
To eat.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.465
Mr. Fellows, Carlton always talks
about your English class.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.871
- He said you were studying Shakespeare.
- This is really exciting.

16:16.942 --> 16:20.105
<i>We're reading Hamlet.
But to make it more relevant to the kids...</i>

16:20.179 --> 16:23.114
I'm teaching it to them in a rap version
I wrote myself.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.009
Oh, Lord.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.851
Peep this.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.620
"To be in effect...

16:33.726 --> 16:35.785
"or not to be in effect?

16:35.928 --> 16:39.125
"Slamming, man, on the questioning tip."

16:42.101 --> 16:43.227
Yeah.

16:45.704 --> 16:49.003
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner will be served in 10 minutes.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.743
Excuse me.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.411
What are you doing?

17:03.489 --> 17:07.185
It seems that little Mr. Poppin' Fresh
doesn't want to come out of his tube.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.060
Perhaps this will persuade him.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.896
Ashley, how's the cranberry sauce
coming?

17:17.970 --> 17:19.904
- All done.
- Darn it!

17:22.007 --> 17:25.443
- Nice going, Carlton!
- Do you want to try to make this?

17:25.511 --> 17:27.705
This stuffing is completely dry.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.845
Look, do I have to do everything myself?

17:32.851 --> 17:35.945
Carlton, this isn't exactly brain surgery.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.956
When something is too dry,
what do we do?

17:40.526 --> 17:42.619
Cream of mushroom soup.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.560
Pour.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.723
Mix.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.697
Can you do that?

17:51.537 --> 17:54.529
- Hilary, did you check the yams?
- For what?

17:54.640 --> 17:55.971
Oh, my God.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.543
Shall we say grace?

18:04.116 --> 18:07.347
Dear Lord, for this food
we are about to receive...

18:07.419 --> 18:09.011
make us truly thankful.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.651
Amen.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.486
Let's start by serving our guest of honor.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.528
- Mr. Fellows, care for some yams?
- I'd love some.

18:16.795 --> 18:20.754
Interesting. I've never had them before
with this thick black crust.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.766
It's Cajun style.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.539
Hilary burned them.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.344
They're just burned on top.
Once you get underneath it...

18:34.413 --> 18:36.506
they're totally charred.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.546
How did you do that?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.176
Mom, give Hilary a break.

18:41.253 --> 18:44.017
I think she deserves some credit
for putting out the fire.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.579
Fire?

18:45.657 --> 18:47.682
What else do we have?

18:47.759 --> 18:50.159
That looks like cranberry sauce,
Mr. Fellows.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.561
- Lay it on me.
- Allow me.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.794
- It looks wonderful. Who made it?
- I did, Mommy.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.299
It's delicious.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.933
Yeah, you'd never know
Ashley dropped it on the floor.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.813
What about the stuffing?
Where's that been?

19:11.016 --> 19:13.951
That's dope. Give it a try, Mr. Fellows.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.213
Yeah.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.417
Sure.

19:22.528 --> 19:26.862
I made it, Mr. Fellows.
I'm sure you'll find it of grade "A" quality.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.560
- Speaking of A's...
- Yes?

19:29.635 --> 19:32.126
...Will is gonna get an "A"
in my English class.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.104
Congratulations, baby.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.901
Do you have any news for my parents?

19:36.975 --> 19:38.408
Not really.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.941
So, how about that stuffing?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.571
Serve yourself.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.790
It looks... Looks great. Shall I pass it on?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.522
No!

19:58.597 --> 20:00.656
You can have all of that.

20:00.732 --> 20:03.633
That's a good idea. Save lots of room.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.638
Because we have a turkey
roasted to perfection by yours truly.

20:08.473 --> 20:11.567
- Would you do the honors, Uncle Phil?
- Why, certainly.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.582
It's frozen inside.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.950
I'm sorry. I thawed it as much I could.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.993
What am I supposed to do,
sit on it all day?

20:30.128 --> 20:33.063
Come on, Vi.
The kids worked very hard on this.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.031
Honey, "hard" is the word.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.273
Let's see what food
we can throw together.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.972
I know, 'cause Bigfoot is growling.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.377
Honestly, that dinner was a disaster!

20:52.451 --> 20:56.751
That's not true. Mr. Fellows is out there
drinking his second cup of stuffing.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.620
This is certainly one for the books.

21:02.227 --> 21:05.594
You know, Vi,
you really hurt my feelings yesterday.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.159
What are you talking about?

21:08.233 --> 21:10.861
When you said
I was spoiling Will and my kids.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.303
I'm just trying to give them the things
that we didn't have.

21:14.973 --> 21:18.272
First of all,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.140
Seems to me, when we were growing up...

21:20.212 --> 21:22.806
I'd say a lot worse to you
and you'd take it.

21:22.881 --> 21:26.317
I don't know, I think living in California
has made you sensitive.

21:27.185 --> 21:31.349
I don't think I'm being sensitive, Vi.
You basically called me a bad mother.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.885
Baby, look...

21:35.160 --> 21:37.025
I don't think you're a bad mother.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.792
I never would've sent Will out here
if I thought you were.

21:40.866 --> 21:45.235
I don't blame you for wanting to give
those kids everything we didn't have.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.205
But you got to teach them
how to work hard, too.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.264
That's what I taught you.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.867
You turned out pretty good.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.509
I got to admit it, Vi,
Philip says I'm too easy on them.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.778
I guess they should have
some more responsibilities.

21:59.851 --> 22:00.977
It wouldn't kill them.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.351
Food!

22:03.422 --> 22:05.652
I wouldn't be taking my time in here.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.192
- I'm on my way.
- Here you go.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.153
Ma, can I help you in here?

22:11.229 --> 22:13.561
No, not from what I saw today. Please.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.324
You got to learn how to cook
before you go to college.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.200
Yeah, Aunt Viv can teach me.
She's a great cook.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.240
She should be. I taught her.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.605
And your mama didn't raise no fools.

22:25.811 --> 22:28.644
So, you got an "A" in English?

22:28.714 --> 22:30.443
Yeah.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.642
They think I'm a genius.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.213
You just keep working hard, genius.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.487
When I leave here...

22:40.058 --> 22:43.027
I want you to listen to
your Aunt Viv, okay?

22:43.095 --> 22:44.528
Yes, ma'am.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.395
I have to say...

22:47.466 --> 22:50.765
you guys did a terrible job
with dinner tonight.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.635
I wish I could've seen you cooking it.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.469
Mom, you definitely would've been crying,
straight up.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.408
You make me laugh just thinking about it.

23:00.979 --> 23:03.447
But you always did make me laugh.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.907
I miss that.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.880
I miss it, too.
