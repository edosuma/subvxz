01:20.998 --> 01:25.910
THERE. I BURST THROUGH
TO THE OCEAN'S FLOOR.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.448
WHAT'S UP, KRANG,

01:27.449 --> 01:29.353
BUILDING
A SWIMMING POOL?

01:30.858 --> 01:33.965
NOT A POOL,
YOU FOOL--

01:33.966 --> 01:35.570
A SUPER PUMP.

01:35.571 --> 01:38.177
NOW, I WILL EXTEND
A SECOND PIPE

01:38.178 --> 01:40.417
UP THROUGH
THE EARTH'S CRUST

01:40.418 --> 01:42.890
AND INTO THE CITY SEWERS.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.862
SPARE ME
THE PLUMBING LECTURE,
KRANG,

01:44.863 --> 01:46.132
AND GET TO THE POINT.

01:46.133 --> 01:49.107
THE POINT IS
TO FLOOD THE SEWERS

01:49.108 --> 01:51.480
AND LIQUIDATE
THE TURTLES.

01:51.481 --> 01:55.057
SOUNDS LIKE
ANOTHER OF YOUR

01:56.061 --> 01:57.062
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:57.063 --> 01:59.368
OF THIS NEW TURTLE TUBE
I WHIPPED UP?

01:59.369 --> 02:02.444
BOY, IT'S
TOTALLY TUBULAR, DUDE.

02:03.547 --> 02:05.184
VERY FUNNY.

02:05.185 --> 02:07.891
HEY, I WAS JUST PULLING
YOUR FLIPPER, BUD.

02:07.892 --> 02:10.465
I THINK IT'S
DEVOUTLY BODACIOUS,

02:10.466 --> 02:13.306
NOT TO MENTION
AWESOMELY FANTASTICO.

02:13.307 --> 02:16.983
UH, BUT WHAT ELSE
DOES IT DO BESIDES
JUST FLOAT?

02:16.984 --> 02:18.955
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

02:18.956 --> 02:21.963
IT COMES EQUIPPED
WITH DOZENS OF OPTIONS.

02:21.964 --> 02:24.504
FOR INSTANCE,
TAKE THIS SUCTION GUN.

02:24.505 --> 02:28.481
NOW, LET'S SAY THAT
BULLFROG SITTING THERE
IS SHREDDER.

02:30.955 --> 02:34.029
OH, YEAH. I COULD SEE
THE RESEMBLANCE.

02:34.030 --> 02:36.536
NOW, WATCH WHAT
I DO TO HIM.

02:41.985 --> 02:45.026
HEY, STOP! HEY!

02:48.269 --> 02:50.107
THIS MAKES
A GREAT ARGUMENT

02:50.108 --> 02:52.078
FOR SUCTION-GUN CONTROL.

02:52.079 --> 02:54.318
HERE'S ANOTHER
NICE INNOVATION--

02:54.319 --> 02:55.989
AN EMERGENCY CUTOFF.

03:05.282 --> 03:07.153
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S STILL

03:07.154 --> 03:09.627
A FEW BUGS THAT HAVE
TO BE WORKED OUT.

03:09.628 --> 03:12.801
YEAH. TOAD-ALLY.

03:12.802 --> 03:15.743
I GUESS WE'D BETTER
BE HEADING BACK
TO THE LAIR.

03:15.744 --> 03:18.919
I CAN DEFINITELY RESONATE
WITH THAT NOTION, DUDE.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.480
BUT TIFFANY, I HATE
HAVING BIRTHDAYS.

03:29.481 --> 03:31.620
CAN'T WE JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT
THIS YEAR?

03:31.621 --> 03:35.163
BUT BURNSIE,
BIRTHDAYS ARE SO FUN.

03:35.164 --> 03:38.037
EXACTLY HOW OLD ARE YOU?

03:38.038 --> 03:40.243
I'M TH--I'M TH--

03:40.244 --> 03:41.412
30-SOMETHING.

03:41.413 --> 03:44.355
HAPPY 50th BIRTHDAY,
BOSS.

03:44.356 --> 03:46.426
VERNON, YOU IDIOT!

03:46.427 --> 03:48.699
OOH, SORRY, TIFFY.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.537
I GOT TO GO NOW.

03:50.538 --> 03:53.212
WELL, CHIEF,
YOU READY FOR
YOUR BIRTHDAY LUNCH?

03:53.213 --> 03:55.217
I SHOULD STAY HERE.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.055
WHAT IF
A BIG STORY BREAKS?

03:57.056 --> 03:59.629
THE RESTAURANT IS JUST
ACROSS THE STREET.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.370
SURE. SOMEONE WHO'S
30-SOMETHING LIKE YOU

04:02.371 --> 04:04.877
CAN JUST DASH RIGHT
BACK OVER HERE.

04:08.655 --> 04:12.832
SHREDDER,
IF WE WANT TO FLUSH
OUT THOSE TURTLES,

04:12.833 --> 04:15.305
WE MUST FLOOD
THE SEWERS NOW.

04:15.306 --> 04:17.345
I'M WAITING FOR
BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY

04:17.346 --> 04:19.651
TO BRING ME A BOAT
TO MAKE OUR GETAWAY.

04:19.652 --> 04:22.424
WHAT'S TAKING THEM
SO LONG?

04:22.425 --> 04:24.262
BE PATIENT, KRANG.

04:24.263 --> 04:26.803
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY
ROCKET SCIENTISTS,
YOU KNOW.

04:31.317 --> 04:33.521
WHAT BOAT
SHOULD WE SWIPE?

04:33.522 --> 04:36.864
WE GOT TO DO THIS
SCIENTIFIC-LIKE.

04:36.865 --> 04:39.170
OK. I LIKE RED.

04:39.171 --> 04:41.443
IT'S
MY FAVORITE COLOR.

04:41.444 --> 04:43.616
YEAH. MINE, TOO.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.421
WE'LL TAKE
THE RED BOAT.

04:45.422 --> 04:48.495
NOW START PUSHING.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.077
MAMA!

04:54.078 --> 04:56.919
HANG ON, BEBOP!

04:58.089 --> 05:01.598
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE TOOK
THE BLUE ONE.

05:08.785 --> 05:11.860
I WONDER WHAT DONATELLO'S
PRINTING IN THERE.

05:11.861 --> 05:13.631
MAYBE IT'S
HIS LIFE STORY.

05:13.632 --> 05:15.636
BAD NEWS, GUYS.

05:15.637 --> 05:17.140
THESE
SEISMIC VIBRATIONS

05:17.141 --> 05:19.012
ARE COMING FROM
THE EARTH'S CORE.

05:19.013 --> 05:21.151
THAT COULD MEAN
ONLY ONE THING--

05:21.152 --> 05:22.823
THE TECHNODROME.

05:22.824 --> 05:24.661
AND THAT MEANS
SHREDDER.

05:24.662 --> 05:27.502
I, TOO, SENSE
THE PRESENCE
OF MY OLD ENEMY.

05:27.503 --> 05:29.842
SENSEI, YOU COULD
HAVE TOLD ME THAT

05:29.843 --> 05:32.115
BEFORE I WENT
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

05:32.116 --> 05:33.618
YOU NEVER ASKED ME.

05:35.457 --> 05:38.131
WHERE'S THE BREAKS
ON THIS THING?

05:38.132 --> 05:40.504
WHO DO I LOOK LIKE,

05:40.505 --> 05:42.309
CAPTAIN NEMO?

05:52.906 --> 05:55.278
OOH, THIS
IS DISGUSTING--

05:55.279 --> 05:57.049
EVEN FOR ME.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.459
WELL, AT LEAST
WE DIDN'T HIT
A GARBAGE TRUCK.

06:07.412 --> 06:10.319
SHREDDER,
THE PRESSURE
IS TOO HIGH.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.427
IF THE PUMPING
DOESN'T BEGIN
THIS INSTANT,

06:13.428 --> 06:15.700
THE SUPER PUMP
WILL OVERLOAD.

06:17.204 --> 06:19.443
AHH.
HERE THEY COME NOW.

06:30.007 --> 06:31.811
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU IDIOTS?

06:31.812 --> 06:35.554
WE HIT SOME TRAFFIC
ON THE WAY.

06:35.555 --> 06:38.896
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MUTANTS
COULD USE A BATH.

06:38.897 --> 06:40.901
AND HERE IT COMES.

06:47.588 --> 06:50.661
WOW, IRMA, ISN'T THIS
A GREAT SALAD BAR?

06:50.662 --> 06:52.701
<i>DON'T YOU MEAN,
SALAD BARGE?</i>

06:52.702 --> 06:55.274
THIS THING IS
SO HEALTHY,
IT'S MAKING ME SICK.

06:55.275 --> 06:58.985
I STILL THINK
THIS PARTY IS
A DUMB IDEA.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.391
OH, CHEER UP, CHIEF.

07:01.392 --> 07:03.263
EVERYONE HAS BIRTHDAYS.

07:03.264 --> 07:04.767
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

07:04.768 --> 07:07.274
CHANNEL 6 HASN'T HAD
A SCOOP IN WEEKS.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.212
I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A DRY SPELL.

07:09.213 --> 07:11.251
SOMETHING'S BOUND
TO BREAK SOON.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.440
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE FLUSHED.

07:19.441 --> 07:22.281
TASTY LUNCH, DUDES.

07:22.282 --> 07:23.785
BUT SOMETHING'S MISSING.

07:23.786 --> 07:26.192
YEAH. WE FORGOT
THE REFRESHMENTS.

07:26.193 --> 07:29.434
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE COULD USE SOMETHING
TO WASH THIS DOWN.

07:30.973 --> 07:34.080
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.530
OK, WHO LEFT
THE BATHTUB WATER RUNNING?

07:40.531 --> 07:42.703
LOOK.
MASTER SPLINTER.

07:44.342 --> 07:47.182
I CANNOT HOLD ON
MUCH LONGER.

07:53.066 --> 07:55.906
FAREWELL, TURTLES.

07:59.885 --> 08:03.493
REMEMBER ALL
I HAVE TAUGHT YOU.

08:03.494 --> 08:06.435
WE'VE GOT TO SAVE
MASTER SPLINTER.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.941
COWABUNGA!

08:08.942 --> 08:10.914
SURF'S UP!

08:12.786 --> 08:14.457
<i>GOT YOU, SENSEI.</i>

08:21.143 --> 08:22.645
ALL TOGETHER NOW.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.672
WAY TO GO, MICHELANGELO.

08:32.673 --> 08:35.313
HEY, IT WAS
A RADICAL RIDE.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.352
WE ALMOST DROWNED
LIKE RATS.

08:37.354 --> 08:39.591
OH. SORRY, MASTER.

08:41.030 --> 08:43.635
AN UNDERSTANDABLE
CHOICE OF WORDS.

08:43.636 --> 08:47.647
BUT, LIKE, WHERE DID THAT
GNARLY SURF COME FROM?

08:47.648 --> 08:51.391
HMM. THERE MIGHT BE
A CONNECTION
BETWEEN THIS FLOOD

08:51.392 --> 08:54.834
AND THOSE VIBRATIONS
COMING FROM
THE TECHNODROME.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.075
AHA. SO, THIS
IS WHAT SHREDDER
WAS COOKING UP.

08:58.076 --> 09:01.218
YEAH.
INSTANT TURTLE SOUP.

09:01.219 --> 09:03.289
TAKE 4 TURTLES
AND JUST ADD WATER.

09:06.031 --> 09:09.707
IS THIS KRANG'S IDEA
OF A FLOOD?

09:14.555 --> 09:16.459
ENOUGH WATER, KRANG.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.798
EVEN THE TURTLES
COULDN'T SURVIVE THIS.

09:18.799 --> 09:20.403
FORGET THE TURTLES.

09:20.404 --> 09:22.976
THE TECHNODROME
CAN'T SURVIVE THIS.

09:22.977 --> 09:27.021
THE SUPER PUMP
IS SUCKING IN
THE ENTIRE OCEAN.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.101
THE CITY WILL BE FLOODED
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.809
A SMALL ENOUGH PRICE
TO RID OURSELVES

09:34.810 --> 09:36.981
OF THOSE BLASTED
TURTLES.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.789
SO, WHAT'S EVERYONE
ORDERING FOR LUNCH?

09:39.790 --> 09:43.065
HMM. I WONDER IF
THE SEAFOOD IS FRESH.

09:46.843 --> 09:49.649
LOOKS PRETTY FRESH
TO ME.

09:51.355 --> 09:53.526
GREAT JUMPING
JELLYFISH!

09:53.527 --> 09:55.866
THE ENTIRE STREET
IS FLOODED!

09:55.867 --> 09:58.172
SOMETHING STRANGE
IS GOING ON.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.379
AND I'M GOING TO FIND
OUT WHAT IT IS.

10:00.380 --> 10:03.420
OOH, AND I THINK
I JUST FOUND
MY TRANSPORTATION.

10:03.421 --> 10:06.061
IT'S NO LUXURY YACHT,
BUT IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

10:06.062 --> 10:08.099
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'S APRIL?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.236
HERE I AM, CHIEF.

10:09.237 --> 10:11.575
I'M OFF TO GET
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.414
MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

10:13.415 --> 10:14.785
I'M GOING TO GET
AN EXCLUSIVE

10:14.786 --> 10:17.091
ON THIS FLOOD
FOR TONIGHT'S NEWS.

10:17.092 --> 10:19.664
SHE SURE HAS
A LOT OF GUTS.

10:19.665 --> 10:22.004
SHE ALSO HAS
ALL THE FOOD.

10:24.111 --> 10:27.218
MAN, THE WATER LEVEL'S
STILL RISING.

10:27.219 --> 10:30.093
DONATELLO HAD
BETTER GET BACK HERE
WITH THE TURTLE VAN,

10:30.094 --> 10:31.464
AND FAST.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.101
Donatello:
AHOY, MATEYS.

10:36.712 --> 10:39.251
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE TURTLE VAN?

10:39.252 --> 10:42.126
MONDO CONVERSION, DUDE.

10:42.127 --> 10:45.435
I SWITCHED THE TIRES
AND HOOKED UP
AN OUTBOARD MOTOR.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.576
AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF
ENGINEERING, DONATELLO.

10:48.577 --> 10:50.749
NEXT STEP--
TO TRACK DOWN SHREDDER.

10:52.154 --> 10:55.161
<i>TURTLES, COME IN,
TURTLES, QUICK!</i>

10:55.162 --> 10:56.799
APRIL,
WHERE ARE YOU?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.704
I'M AT THE CORNER
OF 5th AND MAIN.

10:58.705 --> 11:02.548
AND I THINK I'M BEING
INVITED TO LUNCH
BY A HUGE SHARK.

11:02.549 --> 11:05.222
HANG ON. WE'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.709
HUNGRY, BIG GUY, HUH?

11:12.710 --> 11:15.517
HOW ABOUT
SOME LETTUCE,

11:15.518 --> 11:17.857
OR MAYBE SOME
YUMMY CARROT STICKS?

11:17.858 --> 11:22.001
SAY, I'LL BET
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN TASTED
GARBANZO BEANS.

11:23.372 --> 11:26.680
I GUESS
HE HATES VEGGIES.

11:27.784 --> 11:29.822
WE'LL HANDLE THIS,
APRIL.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.131
OH, TURTLES.
THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE.

11:38.012 --> 11:40.317
TELEPHONE CALL
FOR MR. JAWS.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.205
DON'T CALL US.
WE'LL CALL YOU.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.891
OH, AT LAST,
MY TRIUMPH IS COMPLETE.

11:54.892 --> 11:57.431
THE TURTLES HAVE BEEN
SWEPT OUT OF THE SEWERS

11:57.432 --> 11:59.102
INTO OBLIVION.

11:59.103 --> 12:00.807
OBLIVION!

12:00.808 --> 12:03.982
SO THAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT STREET.

12:03.983 --> 12:05.820
THE TURTLES LIVE.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.993
STOP THE BOAT.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.065
THE WATER PRESSURE
SHOULD'VE CRUSHED THEM.

12:10.066 --> 12:11.737
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:11.738 --> 12:13.307
ME, NEITHER.

12:13.308 --> 12:16.750
SHE'S GOT
A SALAD BAR
ON HER BOAT.

12:16.751 --> 12:18.488
OBLITERATE THEM.

12:20.728 --> 12:22.733
AND YOU THINK
SHREDDER'S BEHIND THIS?

12:22.734 --> 12:25.106
NOT ONLY IS
HE BEHIND THIS,

12:25.107 --> 12:27.413
HE'S ALSO
BEHIND US.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.688
ROCKSTEADY, TOSS THEM
A BLASTER GRENADE.

12:30.689 --> 12:35.033
IT'S TURTLE
TRASHIN' TIME.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.072
A GRENADE!

12:37.073 --> 12:40.047
COME ON.
THAT BOAT'S ABOUT
TO BE TOSSED SALAD.

12:42.822 --> 12:44.927
WHICH OF YOU BOZOS
ORDERED SALAD

12:44.928 --> 12:46.431
WITH A GRENADE
ON THE SIDE?

12:47.602 --> 12:50.909
I'LL GET YOU
WRETCHED REPTILES YET.

13:03.144 --> 13:05.950
FASTER,
YOU INCOMPETENT DRONES.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.357
THE SUPER PUMP
MUST BE REPAIRED.

13:08.358 --> 13:12.034
I WARNED SHREDDER
IT WOULD OVERLOAD.

13:15.076 --> 13:17.415
OH, NO.

13:18.921 --> 13:21.326
KRANG,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

13:21.327 --> 13:23.599
I HAVE MY OWN PROBLEM.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.272
AND IT'S A LOT BIGGER
THAN YOURS.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.615
I NEED YOUR HELP.
THE TURTLES ARE
STILL ALIVE.

13:29.616 --> 13:32.389
HMM, MY DEAR SHREDDER,

13:32.390 --> 13:35.732
PERHAPS I CAN
HELP YOU AFTER ALL.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.358
THE BIGGEST STORY SINCE
THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD,

13:45.359 --> 13:49.703
AND I CAN'T GET BACK
TO FILE IT.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.608
HOW WAS I TO KNOW
YOUR BIRTHDAY LUNCH

13:51.609 --> 13:53.848
WOULD TURN OUT
LIKE A DISASTER MOVIE?

13:53.849 --> 13:56.856
BOSS, WHY DON'T WE
SEND OUT A VOLUNTEER?

13:56.857 --> 13:59.062
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD,
GOOD, VERNON.

13:59.063 --> 14:00.700
THANKS
FOR VOLUNTEERING.

14:00.701 --> 14:03.441
HERE. BETTER PUT
ON THIS DIVING SUIT.

14:06.483 --> 14:08.622
NOW JUST BREATHE
NORMALLY.

14:08.623 --> 14:11.830
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.866
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

14:27.875 --> 14:29.912
VERNON,
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:29.913 --> 14:33.155
A-A HUGE,
HORRIBLE MONSTER

14:33.156 --> 14:36.765
WITH AN ENORMOUS MOUTH
AND 8 ARMS. AHH!

14:37.769 --> 14:39.138
IS THAT ALL?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.942
OH, WHAT A WIMP.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.520
WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR, BOSS?

14:44.521 --> 14:46.725
A GIANT SQUID.

14:46.726 --> 14:48.296
AND WHEN IT SURFACES,

14:48.297 --> 14:50.001
THIS BRAIN WAVE NEUTRALIZER

14:50.002 --> 14:51.605
WILL DO THE REST.

14:53.010 --> 14:55.850
HEY, WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA?

14:55.851 --> 14:59.326
OH, YOU FOUND HIM!
DON'T LET HIM
GET AWAY.

14:59.327 --> 15:01.666
YOU GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.607
NOW, TO TAME
THE BEAST.

15:07.316 --> 15:09.521
IT'S NOW ACTIVATED.

15:09.522 --> 15:12.662
THE SQUID
IS UNDER MY CONTROL.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.337
NOW, TO TEST
ITS OBEDIENCE.

15:15.338 --> 15:18.578
I COMMAND YOU
TO RELEASE HIM.

15:20.351 --> 15:22.356
OH, IT WORKS!

15:22.357 --> 15:25.197
PATIENCE,
MY PET. PATIENCE.

15:25.198 --> 15:29.341
SOON, YOU WILL HAVE
ALL THE TURTLES
YOU CAN EAT.

15:34.657 --> 15:37.764
FELLAS, WE'VE GOT TO PULL
THE PLUG ON THIS FLOOD.

15:37.765 --> 15:41.106
BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THE WATER'S
COMING FROM.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.079
I'D SAY THAT SHARK
I TANGLED WITH

15:43.080 --> 15:44.884
WAS DEFINITELY
AN OUT-OF-TOWNER.

15:44.885 --> 15:47.892
WHICH MEANS THE WATER
MUST BE COMING
FROM THE OCEAN.

15:47.893 --> 15:51.067
AND I'LL BET SHREDDER
IS BEHIND THIS FLOODING.

15:51.068 --> 15:53.975
WELL, THEN,
LET'S JUST FIND HIM
AND ASK HIM TO STOP.

15:53.976 --> 15:56.047
UH-OH, DUDES.

15:56.048 --> 15:59.523
HUMONGOUS WAVE
OFF THE PORT BOW...

15:59.524 --> 16:02.431
OR IS THAT
THE STARBOARD BEAM?

16:04.304 --> 16:07.779
WELL, AT LEAST I GOT
THE HUMONGOUS PART RIGHT.

16:14.967 --> 16:16.570
FINALLY, KRANG,

16:16.571 --> 16:20.147
I HAVE THE WEAPON
WITH WHICH TO DESTROY
THE TURTLES.

16:20.148 --> 16:22.586
YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIND THEM FIRST.

16:22.587 --> 16:25.728
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO JUST COME TO YOU.

16:25.729 --> 16:27.901
COWABUNGA!

16:29.406 --> 16:32.246
WHY, IT'S
THE TURTLE VAN.

16:32.247 --> 16:35.756
AW, THERE GOES
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:35.757 --> 16:39.399
OK, FELLAS.
THE MOMENT WE'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.273
YEAH. LET'S DO
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

16:42.274 --> 16:44.078
BE ALERT, MY STUDENTS.

16:44.079 --> 16:46.218
THERE MAY BE MORE HERE
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

16:46.219 --> 16:48.724
NO PROBLEMO.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.764
WE'VE TRASHED
SHREDDER ON LAND.

16:50.765 --> 16:52.969
WE CAN TRASH HIM
ON WATER.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.412
TURTLES,
FIGHT WITH HONOR!

16:57.717 --> 16:59.119
GO FOR IT, BUD!

16:59.120 --> 17:00.857
WE'RE READY,
METAL MOUTH!

17:00.858 --> 17:02.294
GIVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT.

17:02.295 --> 17:05.502
YOU'LL REGRET
HAVING SAID THAT,

17:07.710 --> 17:11.954
OH, WOW.
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT THING.

17:11.954 --> 17:13.926
TRULY AWESOME.

17:13.928 --> 17:17.603
AND BEST OF ALL,
IT OBEYS ONLY ME.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.742
FEARLESS LEADER,

17:19.742 --> 17:22.281
UM, MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO SOUND A RETREAT.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.622
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S GOT 8 ARMS.

17:24.623 --> 17:26.327
WE'VE GOT 8 ARMS.

17:26.328 --> 17:29.001
TURTLES, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BECOME HISTORY.

17:29.002 --> 17:31.508
AND I SQUID YOU NOT.
HA HA HA!

17:31.509 --> 17:34.014
OH, I DO BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY MADE A FUNNY.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.658
EXCELLENT, MY PET.

17:37.659 --> 17:39.663
NOW, DO
YOUR NASTIEST.

17:47.118 --> 17:50.125
THIS IS BETTER
THAN A VIDEO GAME.

17:50.126 --> 17:52.030
LET 'EM HAVE IT,
BOSS.

17:52.031 --> 17:55.072
YEAH.
SPLATTERIZE 'EM!

17:55.073 --> 17:58.380
NOT YET.
I'M HAVING
TOO MUCH FUN.

18:02.159 --> 18:05.901
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THAT REMOTE CONTROL.

18:05.902 --> 18:08.007
I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

18:08.008 --> 18:11.148
SPLINTER, THE TURTLES
ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

18:11.149 --> 18:14.558
WE MUST BREAK
SHREDDER'S CONTROL
OF THAT GIANT SQUID.

18:14.559 --> 18:16.129
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

18:19.773 --> 18:20.808
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT.

18:22.314 --> 18:24.118
THIS COULD GET BUMPY.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.783
I'VE GOT IT.

18:35.784 --> 18:38.724
WAY TO GO, DUDE.

18:38.725 --> 18:41.598
UH, EASY, BIG FELLA.

18:41.599 --> 18:42.601
DOWN, BOY.

18:48.618 --> 18:51.927
I TOLD YOU
TO SPLATTERIZE 'EM.

18:51.928 --> 18:55.135
OH, SHUT UP,
YOU TOADYING TWERP.

18:56.674 --> 18:58.444
OK, SHREDDER.

18:58.445 --> 19:00.316
NOW, IT'S OUR TURN.

19:04.128 --> 19:06.399
MAMA!

19:10.210 --> 19:13.218
HEY, NO FAIR!

19:16.896 --> 19:19.903
THAT LOOKS LIKE
MAJOR KICKS.

19:19.904 --> 19:22.811
HEY, HOW ABOUT LETTING ME
PRESS A FEW BUTTONS, HUH?

19:22.812 --> 19:24.850
NO. DON'T.

19:29.597 --> 19:30.766
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

19:30.767 --> 19:33.874
THANKS A LUMP, DUDE.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.947
<i>UH, SORRY, AMIGOS.</i>

19:35.948 --> 19:38.721
WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THIS GIANT SQUID?

19:38.722 --> 19:41.294
WELL, IF I REMOVE
THAT CONTROL DEVICE,

19:41.295 --> 19:44.604
IT'LL PROBABLY MAKE
ITS OWN WAY BACK
TO THE OCEAN.

19:45.674 --> 19:46.775
GOT IT.

19:49.284 --> 19:51.923
WHAT FANTASTIC FOOTAGE!

19:51.924 --> 19:54.664
THIS'LL BE
THE TOP STORY
ON TONIGHT'S NEWS.

19:54.665 --> 19:57.907
AT LAST,
THE CREATURE CAN RETURN
TO ITS UNDERWATER HOME.

19:57.908 --> 20:00.814
HEY. SPEAKING
OF HOMES THAT ARE
UNDER WATER,

20:00.815 --> 20:02.385
WHAT ABOUT OUR LAIR?

20:05.361 --> 20:08.134
THE SUPER PUMP
IS STUCK IN REVERSE.

20:08.135 --> 20:09.973
IT'S DRAINING THE CITY

20:09.974 --> 20:12.245
AND FLOODING
THE TECHNODROME.

20:12.246 --> 20:16.256
KEEP BAILING.
I NEVER HAD THIS THING
RUSTPROOFED.

20:23.042 --> 20:25.147
THE WATER IS
ACTUALLY RECEDING.

20:25.148 --> 20:26.317
WHAT WAS
YOUR FIRST CLUE?

20:27.355 --> 20:28.523
BLAST IT!

20:28.524 --> 20:30.462
WHERE'S APRIL O'NEILL?

20:30.463 --> 20:33.470
WE GO ON THE AIR
IN 3 MINUTES.

20:33.471 --> 20:35.108
NEVER MIND APRIL.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.180
SOMEONE GET
THIS HELMET OFF ME.

20:37.181 --> 20:41.090
MAYBE IF YOU
DIDN'T HAVE SUCH
A SWELLED HEAD.

20:41.091 --> 20:43.731
CHIEF, I'M HERE WITH
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

20:43.732 --> 20:45.569
MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

20:45.570 --> 20:47.141
JUST LIKE I PROMISED.

20:47.142 --> 20:49.480
WE'LL SCOOP THE NETWORKS
WITH THIS STORY.

20:51.486 --> 20:55.263
<i>AND SO, THE GIANT SQUID
RETURNED TO THE SAFETY
OF THE OCEAN.</i>

20:55.264 --> 20:59.674
<i>AND NOW, I'D LIKE
TO SIGN OFF WITH
2 VERY SPECIAL WORDS.</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:02.115
<i>TURTLE POWER!</i>

21:02.116 --> 21:05.825
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
APRIL'S THANKING US.

21:05.826 --> 21:08.098
AND IN PRIME TIME, TOO.

21:08.099 --> 21:11.574
I HOPE THE TURTLES
ENJOY THIS.

21:13.011 --> 21:15.585
LOOK, SQUID.

21:15.586 --> 21:18.225
GANGWAY!
NO! SQUID!

21:18.226 --> 21:19.529
I'M OUT OF HERE!

21:19.530 --> 21:21.935
IN CELEBRATION
OF TODAY'S EVENTS,

21:21.936 --> 21:25.010
I HAVE PREPARED
A SPECIAL SQUID DISH.

21:25.011 --> 21:27.684
DID YOU SAY SQUID?

21:27.685 --> 21:30.191
<i>SENSEI,
IN MICHELANGELO'S CASE,</i>

21:30.192 --> 21:32.464
YOU SHOULD'VE
PREPARED CHICKEN.

21:34.203 --> 21:35.639
GOOD ONE, RAPHAEL.
