00:20.551 --> 00:23.033
<i>Wonder Wharf
feels more like Winter Wharf</i>

00:23.098 --> 00:25.410
<i>after a record-breaking
snowstorm overnight.</i>

00:25.544 --> 00:27.910
<i>Someone tell Santa
to put on his snow tires.</i>

00:28.047 --> 00:29.395
Ah! Ha! Snow tires.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.176
<i>With schools
on winter break this week,</i>

00:31.269 --> 00:33.684
<i>it's a nice day for...
a white sledding.</i>

00:33.817 --> 00:36.307
You are correct, Olsen Benner
from Channel 6 News.

00:36.372 --> 00:38.205
We're gonna sled
ourselves sick.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.704
Sledding's my favorite sport
because Lady Gravity

00:40.769 --> 00:42.064
does all the work.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.445
I've been practicing
my "whee!"

00:43.551 --> 00:45.176
Whoo!
Oh, wait.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.535
<i>Snowplows have been working</i>

00:46.620 --> 00:48.666
since early this morning
to clear the streets

00:48.731 --> 00:50.145
and bury my Subaru.

00:50.309 --> 00:52.184
Hey, that's my truck.
Wow!

00:52.278 --> 00:53.941
It looks ten pounds
heavier on TV.

00:54.044 --> 00:56.104
Oh, yeah,
look at you plowing.

00:56.169 --> 00:57.751
- Where are you?
- Church parking lot.

00:57.816 --> 01:00.064
I got to call my mom.
This counts as going, right?

01:00.129 --> 01:02.103
Whoa, Teddy,
you're really fishtailing a lot.

01:02.168 --> 01:04.168
Yeah, I am.
It's snowy, Bob.

01:04.282 --> 01:05.809
Do you even know
how to plow, Bob?

01:05.937 --> 01:07.886
You just drive...
drive a car

01:07.952 --> 01:09.869
and push the snow off
to the side, right?

01:09.934 --> 01:11.816
Yes.
Something like that.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.221
All right, team,
let's chop-chop with the hot-choc.

01:14.286 --> 01:15.926
- Sleds await.
- Hang on.

01:18.231 --> 01:20.361
There's a marshmallow down
there I cannot reach.

01:20.426 --> 01:22.689
- That's life, pal.
- Have fun, kids.

01:22.754 --> 01:24.645
If you see Rudolph,
don't make fun of him.

01:24.739 --> 01:25.996
He doesn't like that.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.533
So, the plan is we sled,

01:28.598 --> 01:29.658
and then
we sled some more,

01:29.723 --> 01:31.187
and then we keep sledding.
Sound good?

01:31.252 --> 01:33.598
Huh, I see sleds,
but I don't see butts in them.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.762
Rudy, Darryl,
why aren't you guys sledding?

01:35.847 --> 01:37.996
We've got a little
situation.

01:38.135 --> 01:40.356
Oh, just go behind a tree
and use some leaves.

01:40.427 --> 01:41.478
And don't be
creeped out by that

01:41.543 --> 01:43.056
one squirrel
that likes to watch.

01:43.121 --> 01:45.434
N-No,
I'm talking about that.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.064
- Hey! Ow!
- Ugh. Logan.

01:49.181 --> 01:50.941
Here's a snowball
in your spleen.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.510
- And a snowball in your ween.
- Ow!

01:54.575 --> 01:55.944
Aah! I don't want
to get snowballs

01:56.009 --> 01:57.033
in any of those places.

01:57.098 --> 01:58.598
Yeah,
I'm a snowball magnet.

01:58.675 --> 02:00.657
Maybe we should sled
somewhere that doesn't have

02:00.722 --> 02:01.963
rowdy teen boys
with arms.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.229
Well, now, hold on.
We don't want to go somewhere

02:04.294 --> 02:05.785
with no hot,
rowdy teen boys.

02:05.874 --> 02:07.627
- Nobody said hot.
- Someone did.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.657
Guys, this is
the only hill in the park.

02:09.723 --> 02:10.871
This is where we sled.

02:10.948 --> 02:12.572
We can't let Logan
and his stupid friends

02:12.637 --> 02:13.783
snowball
on our parade.

02:13.848 --> 02:16.371
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

02:18.534 --> 02:19.692
Uh, huh!

02:25.398 --> 02:28.468
Okay, that was perfect,
but let's run away.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.569
Saving Private Ryan called.

02:34.685 --> 02:36.666
It wants
its opening scene back.

02:38.299 --> 02:40.586
You're not gonna believe
what I found in the basement.

02:40.651 --> 02:42.236
A tote bag?
You just found that?

02:42.313 --> 02:43.829
Look at the handles
on that thing.

02:43.906 --> 02:46.306
No, I mean
what's inside the bag.

02:46.376 --> 02:48.439
Ta-da!
It's my knitting yarn.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.344
- Wait, you knit?
- Yeah, I knit.

02:50.421 --> 02:53.242
Are you sure?
Because I've never seen you do it before.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.673
Well, I was gonna knit.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.853
I bought this yarn when I
was pregnant with Louise.

02:56.930 --> 02:58.484
I wanted
to make the kids scarves,

02:58.549 --> 02:59.814
and I never
got around to it.

02:59.891 --> 03:02.526
But now it's time.
It's time to knit or get off the pot.

03:02.591 --> 03:04.810
Ha! I'm gonna make
the kids scarves for Christmas.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.466
Are you gonna
be able to do that, Lin?

03:06.531 --> 03:09.740
- Christmas is in two days.
- Oh, yeah, scarves are a cinch.

03:09.805 --> 03:11.083
You just...
You whip 'em right up.

03:11.148 --> 03:12.810
So, what are you gonna do
with this terrific tote

03:12.875 --> 03:15.225
- that nobody wants?
- Hey, get your hands off that.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.584
- It's my knitting bag.
- Hey, can... can you...

03:16.649 --> 03:19.195
- I just want to look at it.
- Ooh, get off it. Teddy, stop!

03:19.275 --> 03:20.764
Bob, Bob,
who should have the tote?

03:20.829 --> 03:22.297
And don't say
split it in half.

03:22.407 --> 03:23.805
I-I don't want
to get involved.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.683
But Teddy,
he needs it more.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.914
- Ah, yeah, maybe you're right.
- Yes!

03:29.368 --> 03:30.850
That was horrible.

03:30.915 --> 03:32.656
How could something
as pure as snow

03:32.721 --> 03:34.490
be so violently
thrown at us?

03:34.555 --> 03:35.773
This is ridiculous.

03:35.838 --> 03:37.797
I'm gonna go talk some
sense into these fools.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.818
Okay, you do that,
and we'll support you

03:39.895 --> 03:42.227
by standing right here
at this safe distance.

03:43.931 --> 03:46.458
Oh, great,
it's Louise Smellcher.

03:46.535 --> 03:48.248
Oh, clever, Logan.

03:48.313 --> 03:49.889
Look, I know your tiny little brain

03:49.954 --> 03:52.219
doesn't understand things,
so let me help you out here.

03:52.284 --> 03:54.935
This is a sledding hill,
where people sled

03:55.000 --> 03:56.693
every time it snows.

03:56.758 --> 03:59.584
Actually, this is the
snowball-fighting hill now,

03:59.649 --> 04:01.796
because sledding is for babies,
and babies should be home

04:01.861 --> 04:03.517
sleeping
or doing tummy time.

04:03.594 --> 04:05.264
But this is the only hill
in the park.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.587
There's nowhere else
to sled.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.623
Oh, maybe you should try
checking out the hill

04:08.688 --> 04:10.459
by the...
I don't give a crap.

04:10.524 --> 04:12.334
Well, your face gives a crap,

04:12.399 --> 04:14.553
because your face is crap,
Logan.

04:14.618 --> 04:16.803
- Your face is crap.
- Your face is crap!

04:16.868 --> 04:19.060
- Your face is a crap!
- You're the crappest face!

04:19.125 --> 04:20.858
Logan,
are we snowballing or what?

04:20.935 --> 04:22.494
Yeah,
we're snowballing!

04:22.594 --> 04:24.266
Scram, sled wetters.

04:24.337 --> 04:25.633
Son of a...

04:26.130 --> 04:27.881
- Oh, man.
- Ow! What the...?

04:27.946 --> 04:29.373
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

04:29.438 --> 04:31.467
You'd better dash,
diaper rash.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.287
- Got to go.
- Logan, let's just enjoy the day.

04:34.352 --> 04:35.449
- Enjoy that!
- Oh!

04:35.540 --> 04:36.842
Okay, we need a new plan.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.016
Who can throw a snowball
really hard?

04:39.121 --> 04:40.594
- Uh, nah.
- Not so much.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.812
I could give it a try.

04:42.344 --> 04:43.381
Where'd it go?

04:43.446 --> 04:45.287
Hey, my cousin
Mandy is a pitcher

04:45.352 --> 04:46.647
on the high school
softball team.

04:46.712 --> 04:48.461
She lives near here.
Maybe she could help.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.342
Is she good?

04:49.407 --> 04:51.456
She makes underhand
look like overhand.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.234
- Understand?
- No.

04:53.311 --> 04:55.445
You know what? That was confusing.
I'll call her.

04:55.515 --> 04:57.357
Lot of testosterone
down there.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.477
And we've all synced
our cycles up here.

04:59.594 --> 05:00.696
Wow.

05:00.774 --> 05:03.273
Rudy's cousin is Brienne of Tarth.

05:03.368 --> 05:05.055
So, yeah. This is Mandy.

05:05.164 --> 05:06.600
Yeah, hi. I'm Mandy.

05:06.665 --> 05:08.349
Rudy cried
until I said I'd come.

05:08.426 --> 05:11.373
That's how I got you to come to
my yellow belt test at the dojo.

05:11.438 --> 05:13.068
Would've been so cool
if I had passed.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.355
Is that Logan?

05:14.432 --> 05:16.818
- You know him?
- Yeah. He's in my grade.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.550
He used to pick on me
when I was younger.

05:18.665 --> 05:20.328
He called me
Manitary Napkin.

05:20.422 --> 05:22.428
He picked on you?
You're so much bigger than him.

05:22.493 --> 05:23.914
Well, I used to be smaller.

05:24.035 --> 05:26.404
Hey, maybe
I'll be really big and strong

05:26.469 --> 05:27.717
when I'm older,
right, cuz?

05:27.782 --> 05:29.553
Yeah. Sure, buddy. High-five.

05:29.618 --> 05:31.412
High-five... Oh,
ow! - Oof, sorry.

05:31.477 --> 05:34.542
Look, I'm only gonna give
you guys about 15 pitches.

05:34.619 --> 05:36.343
Let me see
if I can even throw snow.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.922
Might be
wasting your time.

05:38.374 --> 05:40.133
Huh, ohh!

05:40.212 --> 05:41.749
- Is he dead?
- Uh...

05:41.826 --> 05:44.092
No, he's moving. Twitching
is moving, right?

05:44.157 --> 05:46.477
Yes. Santa, look away.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.906
This isn't
for your delicate eyes.

05:51.649 --> 05:53.664
OK everybody,
here's the plan.

05:53.741 --> 05:57.162
We protect Mandy
as she rains down frozen terror,

05:57.227 --> 05:59.928
and we take back the land
that is rightfully ours.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.248
We might not all make it...

06:01.313 --> 06:02.490
Why are you looking at me?

06:02.555 --> 06:05.225
Shh. But those that do
will remember the fallen.

06:05.290 --> 06:06.718
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.413
That's
my little warrior.

06:13.226 --> 06:15.146
Oh, good.
I was wondering

06:15.211 --> 06:17.273
where I was gonna
put all this snow.

06:17.352 --> 06:19.804
Now I know.
In your tiny, dumb face.

06:19.881 --> 06:22.231
- Shields up!
- Uh, okay.

06:22.308 --> 06:25.192
It's time for a pitch slap!

06:25.269 --> 06:27.905
Manitary Napkin? What
are you doing here?

06:28.765 --> 06:30.577
Oh! My neck!

06:32.554 --> 06:34.444
Advance!

06:36.347 --> 06:38.014
Advance!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.662
Advance!

06:47.304 --> 06:49.075
- I'm out of here.
- Me, too.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.341
- Come on, Logan.
- No way.

06:50.418 --> 06:51.897
I'm not going
anywhere.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.421
Okay, maybe I am.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.856
Yes! Nice work,
Manitary Napkin.

06:58.921 --> 07:00.593
Thanks.
Wait, don't call me that.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.822
Right, right, right, right,
right, right, right right.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.400
- Lin, can you take these to table two?
- Bob, I can't.

07:06.507 --> 07:07.997
I'm knitting,
and I got to keep going.

07:08.062 --> 07:09.302
Wait, that's all
you've done?

07:09.367 --> 07:11.552
Yes, Bob. It's slow at first,

07:11.617 --> 07:13.802
but then it's like
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba, scarf.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.333
Now stop
distracting me.

07:15.398 --> 07:17.888
Okay, I'll just cook
and serve the food

07:17.953 --> 07:20.663
and do everything and
you're not listening.

07:21.570 --> 07:22.851
Lin.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.138
Oh, my beautiful scarves.

07:28.203 --> 07:29.731
Great job, Linda.

07:29.796 --> 07:32.085
Thank you,
Knitcracker.

07:34.132 --> 07:35.388
Lin, you're scaring me.

07:35.453 --> 07:36.958
- Wha...?
- Who's Knit-cracker?

07:37.023 --> 07:39.307
Nobody. Oh, no,
I dropped a stitch.

07:39.372 --> 07:42.126
- Oops, another one. Oops, another one.
- Sorry, did I throw you off?

07:42.203 --> 07:44.049
I just thought maybe
you were going crazy.

07:44.114 --> 07:45.877
Hush, Bob! Oh, God, another one.

07:45.942 --> 07:47.124
Ooh, there goes another one.

07:47.985 --> 07:50.307
Hey, Mandy, the dumb teen boys are gone.

07:50.372 --> 07:53.705
You can go. I'm sure you've
got, mm, athletic stuff to do.

07:53.770 --> 07:56.807
I always have athletic stuff to
do, but I'm just sticking around

07:56.872 --> 07:58.963
because Rudy wanted
me to watch him sled.

07:59.028 --> 08:00.872
Look at me! Backwards!

08:00.949 --> 08:03.018
Tell the other cousins about this. Oh!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.198
Oh, my God, too scary.
Turning around, turning around.

08:05.263 --> 08:07.229
Whee! I feel like a kid again.

08:07.294 --> 08:09.815
I feel like I'm in one of
those breath mint commercials.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.840
Is that a giant white round bird?

08:11.917 --> 08:13.737
It's not!

08:13.829 --> 08:14.953
What the hell?

08:15.030 --> 08:16.521
The teenage boys
are back.

08:16.598 --> 08:18.580
And they brought their
young-looking dad.

08:18.657 --> 08:20.676
Everyone,
I'd like you to meet Cameron.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.706
He's on
the varsity basketball team.

08:22.771 --> 08:24.502
He's their best outside shooter.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.588
Hey, you, uh... you shoot
a lot of threes, Cameron?

08:26.665 --> 08:29.425
Yeah. Threes and twos
and occasionally ones.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.863
Yeah, that's right.
All the numbers.

08:32.042 --> 08:34.690
Oh, no.
Everyone into formation, quick!

08:34.755 --> 08:36.513
Don't worry, I got this.

08:36.597 --> 08:37.597
Oh!

08:37.676 --> 08:40.481
Oh, snow down my back!
Snow down my back!

08:40.546 --> 08:42.030
Oh, oh!

08:42.123 --> 08:43.948
Down my crack. That's it, I'm done.

08:44.013 --> 08:45.650
No! Where are you going?

08:45.727 --> 08:47.979
Sorry, guys. Oh,
I feel it with every step.

08:48.044 --> 08:49.846
Uh, I'm gonna go, too.

08:49.911 --> 08:51.255
Too much snow time for me.

08:51.332 --> 08:53.026
Uh, Louise, based on how far

08:53.091 --> 08:55.659
my wiener has retracted into
my body, we should go, too.

08:55.728 --> 08:57.582
Ugh! Fine, we're leaving.

08:57.658 --> 08:59.440
But we're walking away
with dignity.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.278
Aah! Forget dignity!

09:01.372 --> 09:02.996
Just go! Go, go, go, go!

09:04.691 --> 09:06.040
Hey, Teddy.
Back so soon?

09:06.105 --> 09:08.237
What?
I just plowed two parking lots.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.708
That means I get two cups of coffee.
That's my system.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.291
I'm gonna have 18 cups of coffee
today.

09:12.356 --> 09:14.045
- Mm.
- How's the scarf, Linda?

09:14.129 --> 09:16.994
It's great. Great. Everything's going
perfectly. I'm right on track.

09:17.059 --> 09:18.455
Lin, I-I'm worried
you're not gonna get

09:18.520 --> 09:19.822
three scarves done
by Christmas.

09:19.887 --> 09:22.548
I mean, you've only done
about a... inch and a half,

09:22.613 --> 09:24.353
and it's been, like, three hours.

09:24.418 --> 09:25.775
Thanks for the pep talk,
Bob.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.548
Yeah.
Who invited Dr. Scrooge?

09:27.613 --> 09:30.355
- Scrooge was not a doctor.
- Not a medical doctor, right.

09:30.434 --> 09:31.908
Listen, Lin,
maybe I can help.

09:31.973 --> 09:33.364
What do you mean?
Like, knit?

09:33.441 --> 09:35.023
Yeah. You can show me how,
right?

09:35.100 --> 09:36.934
All right.
Here, watch me.

09:37.011 --> 09:40.262
You put the thing through the thing,
and you pull it through like this...

09:40.339 --> 09:41.639
Mm-hmm. -
Yay, it worked.

09:41.716 --> 09:43.841
- Nice one, Linda.
- Here, Bob. You try.

09:43.918 --> 09:45.868
Now, don't rush.
You take your time.

09:45.945 --> 09:48.283
- Okay.
- It unravels so easily.

09:48.348 --> 09:50.506
You got to be real
careful... Oh, you did it.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.916
- Yeah.
- You did it again.

09:51.981 --> 09:53.689
Yeah.
It-it's easier than I thought.

09:53.754 --> 09:55.712
Okay, all right,
calm down. Give it.

09:55.949 --> 09:57.088
Oh, they're back.

09:57.165 --> 09:58.360
Hide the yarn.
Don't let them see it.

09:58.425 --> 10:00.113
How was sledding, kids?

10:01.412 --> 10:03.274
Logan and his friends
took over the sledding hill

10:03.339 --> 10:05.040
and threw basketball-sized
snowballs at us.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.283
Ugh. Snow bullies.
When I was little,

10:07.348 --> 10:09.275
this kid Ricky used
to follow me around

10:09.340 --> 10:11.556
and throw snowballs at me
every time it snowed.

10:11.621 --> 10:12.933
And I'd try to laugh it
off.

10:13.941 --> 10:15.776
"Very funny, Ricky.
I love it."

10:15.848 --> 10:17.947
But I hated it, you know?
I-I hated him.

10:18.012 --> 10:19.931
I used to fantasize
about sneaking up on him

10:19.996 --> 10:21.009
when he was volunteering

10:21.074 --> 10:22.603
and just nailing him
with a snowball.

10:22.668 --> 10:24.361
And all the homeless
people just laugh at him.

10:24.426 --> 10:27.564
Wait, your childhood bully was
a volunteer at a homeless shelter?

10:27.629 --> 10:29.111
Yeah,
he was an Eagle Scout.

10:29.188 --> 10:30.759
Darn those mean boys

10:30.824 --> 10:32.415
for ruining my babies' fun.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.836
We could still have fun.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.542
Maybe we could build
a snowman out front.

10:35.607 --> 10:38.908
Oh, yeah. We could use dog-pee
snow to give him blond hair

10:38.973 --> 10:41.323
and a gold chain and
a pee stain on his pants.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.634
I don't want to build
a dog-pee snowman.

10:43.699 --> 10:44.720
I want to sled.

10:44.785 --> 10:46.613
This is our winter break,
damn it.

10:46.748 --> 10:48.001
But there's nothing
we can do.

10:48.066 --> 10:49.323
Logan and his friends have
the hill.

10:49.388 --> 10:50.830
I know that, Tina.

10:50.895 --> 10:52.400
Whelp, got to get back out there.

10:52.465 --> 10:54.689
The extra-wide men's
shoe store parking lot

10:54.754 --> 10:55.952
is not gonna plow itself.

10:56.074 --> 10:57.543
And you know what?
Narrow lot.

10:57.608 --> 10:58.714
See you, Teddy.

10:58.954 --> 11:01.331
Guys,
I changed my mind.

11:01.396 --> 11:03.011
Let's build that snowman.

11:03.740 --> 11:04.989
- Teddy.
- Yeah?

11:05.066 --> 11:07.708
I was just thinking about
your snow bully, Ricky.

11:07.865 --> 11:09.293
Eh, yeah, Ricky.

11:09.370 --> 11:12.253
Yeah. I bet you wish you could
get him back somehow, huh?

11:12.318 --> 11:14.214
You mean like
get a job as his doctor

11:14.279 --> 11:15.807
and then tell him
he's gonna die in a month?

11:15.872 --> 11:16.948
Yeah, that could work,

11:17.013 --> 11:20.307
or you could help us get
back at our snow bullies.

11:20.372 --> 11:21.390
What? How?

11:21.468 --> 11:23.353
Logan and his jerk
friends couldn't throw

11:23.418 --> 11:24.833
their dumb snowballs
on the hill

11:24.910 --> 11:26.815
if there was
no snow for them to throw.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.729
Like if someone plowed it
all away?

11:28.914 --> 11:31.006
Oh, wow. Yeah.
Who would do that?

11:31.083 --> 11:32.180
You would, Teddy.

11:32.257 --> 11:34.652
Oh, no. I only do
driveways and parking lots.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.292
Oh, okay. I guess the
snow bullies win again.

11:37.357 --> 11:39.036
Ricky would be proud.

11:39.718 --> 11:41.849
All right,
all right, that's hilarious.

11:42.779 --> 11:44.265
All right,
that's enough, Ricky!

11:44.330 --> 11:46.224
That's enough, Ricky!

11:46.581 --> 11:48.006
Okay, I'll do it.

11:48.076 --> 11:49.354
- You'll do it?
- I'll do it.

11:49.419 --> 11:51.633
Louise, if Teddy plows the hill,
then we can't sled.

11:51.698 --> 11:53.440
That is not what
this is about, Tina.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.580
If she can't be mine,
then no one can have her.

11:55.645 --> 11:57.282
You can't force someone
to love you, Louise.

11:57.347 --> 11:58.956
- Wait, what are we talking about?
- The hill.

11:59.021 --> 12:01.365
- We're plowing that son of a bitch!
- Yeah, we are.

12:01.441 --> 12:03.411
And we'll blame it
all on global warming.

12:03.482 --> 12:04.740
It's the perfect crime.

12:05.419 --> 12:06.687
Bedtime, kids.

12:06.764 --> 12:09.111
Turn off the TV and
jingle your butts to bed.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.903
I'll, uh, go in a sec.

12:11.209 --> 12:13.106
Come on, Teddy.

12:14.419 --> 12:15.309
Is it done?

12:15.403 --> 12:16.831
I can't. I-I can't do it.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.909
I'm not supposed to be
driving my plow in the park.

12:18.974 --> 12:20.018
I'd get in big trouble.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.942
Ugh. Teddy, listen.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.911
You're not hurting anyone.
You're helping.

12:24.982 --> 12:27.203
And besides, no one's
gonna know it was you.

12:27.268 --> 12:30.597
- Who's calling this late?
- Telemarketer selling makeup.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.948
Ooh,
what kind of makeup?

12:32.013 --> 12:34.020
Oh, actually, it's insurance.

12:34.136 --> 12:35.298
Oh, ew.

12:35.399 --> 12:36.436
Teddy, you there?

12:36.501 --> 12:38.162
Oh, God, oh, God, oh,
God, oh, God, oh, God.

12:38.227 --> 12:39.268
Okay, I'm coming down there.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.347
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You stay where you are.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.037
The-the-the park's
no place for a kid.

12:43.115 --> 12:45.541
I'll take care of this.
You can do this, Teddy.

12:45.705 --> 12:48.419
Just picture Ricky in
his Eagle Scout uniform

12:48.599 --> 12:51.497
raising money to build a hospital.

12:53.631 --> 12:55.646
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.848
Hello? Is this the police?

12:57.925 --> 12:59.432
It's Louise. Is it done?

12:59.497 --> 13:01.151
- Nothing happened.
- You didn't do it?

13:01.245 --> 13:02.327
I didn't say that.

13:02.413 --> 13:03.995
Nothing happened
because I was never here.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.784
So did you do it
or not do it, Teddy?

13:05.849 --> 13:07.902
All I'm gonna say is
the hill looks different

13:07.979 --> 13:09.628
than it did 20 minutes ago.

13:09.693 --> 13:11.573
I-I got to go, Louise.
I got to get out of

13:11.638 --> 13:14.286
this park that I was never
in and I'm not in right now.

13:14.409 --> 13:15.475
Yes.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.745
Oh, look at your scarf.

13:18.810 --> 13:20.638
It's so long and so straight.

13:20.703 --> 13:22.636
- Yeah, I think it's almost finished.
- Wow.

13:22.701 --> 13:23.823
How-how's yours
coming?

13:23.888 --> 13:24.935
It's coming along.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.856
Is it a little narrow?

13:26.927 --> 13:28.433
No, it's not narrow.

13:28.498 --> 13:30.144
It's like a tie.
But that's good.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.076
- It could be a tie.
- It's supposed to be,

13:32.153 --> 13:34.187
so it goes around
a couple times.

13:34.264 --> 13:35.903
Right, except for
how short it is.

13:35.973 --> 13:37.958
It's the style, Bob.

13:38.248 --> 13:40.159
Well, I'm gonna go to sleep.

13:40.224 --> 13:42.720
Uh, I could start a new scarf
in the morning if you want.

13:42.797 --> 13:44.497
Great.
Good night.

13:46.630 --> 13:49.254
Oh.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.247
Knit-cracker?

13:51.318 --> 13:53.640
- You suck at this.
- Aah!

13:53.717 --> 13:56.958
You'll be knitting the
same scarf until you die.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.263
Oh, my God.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.612
Hey, Bobby!

14:00.677 --> 14:02.622
- Lin, are you all right?
- Oh! I had a dream.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.652
My scarf was wrapped around
my neck and tried to kill me.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.331
Well, it's not really long
enough to wrap around your neck.

14:08.396 --> 14:09.947
- Right?
- Good night, Bob.

14:10.024 --> 14:11.325
Good night.

14:14.279 --> 14:16.829
Revenge.
The best sleeping pill.

14:16.896 --> 14:19.057
The town is
getting a double dose of winter

14:19.122 --> 14:22.479
after a second record-breaking
snowfall early this morning.

14:22.544 --> 14:25.683
What? It snowed?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:25.748 --> 14:28.231
- Isn't it pretty?
- No!

14:28.349 --> 14:30.192
Well, I'm gonna go shovel
the sidewalk.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.847
Wow, Dad. That's, like, the
butchest thing you've ever said.

14:32.912 --> 14:35.104
- Thanks, Gene.
- I'm gonna go work on the scar...

14:35.169 --> 14:36.995
I mean, work on something
really special

14:37.060 --> 14:38.143
that you're all gonna love.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.375
I mean-I mean nothing.
Stay out of my room!

14:41.806 --> 14:43.731
Stupid snow.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.650
- Louise, are you our new kitchen?
- This is armor.

14:46.727 --> 14:50.296
I'm going back to the hill to sled,
as is my God-given right.

14:50.427 --> 14:52.479
What? No.
Come on, is it worth it?

14:52.544 --> 14:54.964
All this fighting just to sled?
It's Christmas break.

14:55.029 --> 14:57.026
It's the time of year for
peace and goodwill, damn it.

14:57.091 --> 14:59.496
This is the best snow this
town has seen in years,

14:59.573 --> 15:01.707
maybe even ever,
and if I have to,

15:01.793 --> 15:03.908
- I'll sled till I've bled.
- Louise, wait.

15:03.973 --> 15:06.322
No, Tina. You guys stay
here where it's safe.

15:06.387 --> 15:07.541
I'm going alone.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.762
Oh. I was just gonna say

15:08.832 --> 15:10.063
maybe you should take
these oven mitts

15:10.128 --> 15:11.775
- for extra butt padding.
- Oh.

15:11.852 --> 15:15.846
But now this is awkward,
so I guess I'll go with you?

15:15.911 --> 15:18.543
I mean, "I'll go with
you," I said strongly.

15:18.645 --> 15:19.955
We both will.
Right, Gene?

15:20.020 --> 15:22.299
"Right," I said,
not totally knowing

15:22.364 --> 15:23.566
what you guys are
talking about.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.729
Thanks, guys.
It's a good day to die.

15:25.794 --> 15:26.986
- What? -Huh?
- Nothing, nothing.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.332
Get your pots on.

15:30.036 --> 15:31.395
We're all suited up.

15:31.559 --> 15:33.839
We're pretty much
invincible. Let's sled.

15:33.908 --> 15:35.341
Uh, after you.

15:35.497 --> 15:37.067
All right, here I go.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.502
Oh. Oh, no.

15:42.766 --> 15:44.014
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

15:44.079 --> 15:47.092
We're sledding whether you guys
throw snowballs at us or not.

15:47.157 --> 15:49.177
Oh, we're gonna throw snowballs
at you,

15:49.254 --> 15:51.190
but these aren't just
any old snowballs.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.155
All the old snow from yesterday
got plowed for some reason,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.906
and now that snow is
really hard and icy.

15:57.001 --> 15:58.889
These snowballs leave
a mark.

15:58.966 --> 16:00.033
Show her, Caleb.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.953
- How's that feel, buddy?
- Hurts.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.115
Yeah, that's right it hurts.

16:03.180 --> 16:04.728
Throw your dumb, super snowballs.

16:04.805 --> 16:06.184
That's what this is for.

16:06.286 --> 16:07.831
You just rob
a Williams Sonoma?

16:07.908 --> 16:09.776
- What are you, my mom?
- What?

16:09.841 --> 16:11.402
She stole a muffin thing.
Whatever.

16:11.479 --> 16:13.504
- Just give me my sled back.
- Uh-uh.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.666
Give it! Oh, no.

16:15.752 --> 16:18.947
Looks like you're
baking sheet out of luck.

16:21.243 --> 16:24.346
- Get ready to eat snow Smellcher
- Okay

16:24.477 --> 16:27.370
Uh, whatever you do,
don't aim for my butt.

16:27.526 --> 16:29.784
She's trying to get us
to aim for her butt, guys.

16:29.861 --> 16:31.542
She's probably got oven
mitts in there or something.

16:31.607 --> 16:34.216
What? No. That's ridiculous.

16:34.302 --> 16:36.190
Then why does it look like
your butt could take a sheet

16:36.255 --> 16:38.036
of fresh-baked cookies
out of the oven?

16:38.227 --> 16:40.639
- Genetics?
- All right, gentlemen.

16:40.704 --> 16:41.913
On three.

16:41.991 --> 16:44.244
- One, two...
- Stop.

16:44.309 --> 16:46.608
Hit us.
Myself and... Gene?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.954
We were supposed to both use
our armor to block Louise.

16:49.019 --> 16:51.282
Sorry. Seemed like you had
it covered. Here I come.

16:51.366 --> 16:52.912
The more the merrier.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.673
One...

16:54.834 --> 16:56.043
two...

16:56.392 --> 16:57.507
What the...?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.715
- Mandy?
- Manitary Napkin?

17:00.792 --> 17:04.241
- Aah! It's the whole softball team.
- Aah!

17:04.306 --> 17:06.021
And the girls basketball team.

17:06.147 --> 17:07.704
And the lacrosse team.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.180
Get 'em, girls.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.136
Rudy, did you do this?

17:16.284 --> 17:18.476
Yeah. Me and my dad were
driving to get some earrings

17:18.540 --> 17:20.194
for his friend Nancy, even
though they're not sure

17:20.260 --> 17:21.538
where their relationship
is going,

17:21.603 --> 17:23.792
and I saw you guys walking
to the park with your sleds.

17:23.858 --> 17:25.982
I thought you were gonna get killed,
so I called Mandy.

17:26.047 --> 17:28.624
I was at the gym
with some of the girls,

17:28.689 --> 17:31.537
and Sarah called her friend
on the basketball team.

17:31.602 --> 17:35.036
And they were like, "We
can hit Logan with snowballs?"

17:35.101 --> 17:37.257
And then we decided to
call everyone we know

17:37.322 --> 17:40.095
who also wanted to hit Logan
with snowballs, and here we are.

17:40.932 --> 17:42.581
- Ow!
- Logan, this is too intense.

17:42.658 --> 17:44.259
We're gonna take off.

17:44.336 --> 17:47.286
That's right, run away with
your fully formed teenage butts.

17:47.363 --> 17:49.218
And don't even think about
coming back.

17:49.283 --> 17:50.746
No, this isn't over!

17:50.811 --> 17:52.538
It'll be over in a few seconds.

17:52.603 --> 17:55.806
You're about to get wiped
out by a Manitary Napkin.

17:55.930 --> 17:58.376
That's right,
I'm owning it now.

17:58.502 --> 17:59.726
- Uh...
- Hey!

17:59.791 --> 18:02.851
Human shield! Probably the
worst, smallest choice for one,

18:02.916 --> 18:04.098
but-but here we are.

18:05.619 --> 18:06.804
Hey, Teddy.

18:06.869 --> 18:08.583
Another big snowplow day,
huh?

18:08.660 --> 18:10.242
Yeah.
It's a Christmas miracle.

18:10.307 --> 18:11.447
My prayers were
answered.

18:11.585 --> 18:14.025
I said, "Lord, please
don't let anyone find out

18:14.118 --> 18:15.813
about the terrible
thing I did last night."

18:16.004 --> 18:17.161
And then it snowed.

18:17.322 --> 18:18.960
So it's like it never happened.

18:19.025 --> 18:21.663
Wait, Teddy, what terrible
thing did you do last night?

18:21.728 --> 18:23.353
I, uh... I didn't do anything.

18:23.432 --> 18:25.357
What terrible thing
did you do, Bob?

18:25.434 --> 18:27.660
Okay. Hey, Lin, have
you seen my scarves?

18:27.783 --> 18:29.471
I haven't seen them.
I'm sorry.

18:29.548 --> 18:32.538
Huh. That's weird. Because they
were right here a minute ago.

18:32.603 --> 18:34.469
- Ah, I can't help you.
- Linda!

18:34.534 --> 18:36.081
You threw them in the garbage?

18:36.146 --> 18:38.171
No. I threw them in the recycling.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.218
- Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.463
I-I feel like a failure, Bob.

18:43.545 --> 18:46.462
I was gonna be a great knitter
who made my children scarves.

18:46.596 --> 18:48.547
And then I was gonna
start a store on Etsy

18:48.624 --> 18:50.216
and call it "Scarving Children."

18:50.293 --> 18:52.288
But all I made was
this weird-looking mess.

18:52.353 --> 18:54.126
- Oof.
- It's not that bad.

18:54.272 --> 18:55.507
- Yes, it is.
- Teddy.

18:55.572 --> 18:57.468
Let's just give the kids
your scarves.

18:57.533 --> 18:59.554
No. B-Between
my two and your one,

18:59.619 --> 19:01.564
we have a scarf for each kid.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.062
They can just share them, so
no one gets one they don't want.

19:05.127 --> 19:06.190
I guess.

19:06.268 --> 19:08.179
And we could say
your mom knitted them.

19:08.244 --> 19:09.700
They can be a gift
from Gram Gram.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.366
You're gonna blame
Gram Gram for that?

19:11.431 --> 19:13.888
- We blame a lot of stuff on her.
- We do?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.861
Oh, I guess I just do.
I mean, she's great.

19:18.245 --> 19:20.288
- Let go of her.
- She's not a shield.

19:20.353 --> 19:22.210
She's the only sister I have.

19:22.275 --> 19:23.663
- What?
- Oh. Hi.

19:23.728 --> 19:27.142
Oh, Logan, Logan, Logan,
you are so screwed.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.349
Surround him.

19:28.784 --> 19:30.187
Wha-What are you doing?
Stop it!

19:30.252 --> 19:32.515
- S-Stop surrounding me!
- Pummel his ass!

19:32.580 --> 19:34.563
You're gonna have
so much snow in you,

19:34.697 --> 19:36.697
you're going to poop ice.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.564
Poop Ice!
Poop Ice! Poop Ice!

19:39.643 --> 19:41.309
- Poop Ice! Poop Ice!
- Oh, God.

19:41.386 --> 19:43.267
I think this is happening, pal.

19:43.446 --> 19:44.578
Just get out of here.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.667
Time to cover my unmentionables.

19:46.732 --> 19:48.527
Merry Christmas, punk.

19:48.644 --> 19:51.041
Ready... Aim...

19:51.111 --> 19:53.161
Ugh, stupid Christmas.

19:54.901 --> 19:56.049
What the...?

19:58.249 --> 19:59.642
Whoa...

19:59.764 --> 20:01.439
You saved me.

20:01.603 --> 20:02.762
Oh, I didn't save you.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.841
I just kind of gave
you a little head start.

20:04.906 --> 20:06.773
- Get him!
- Oh, no!

20:07.028 --> 20:08.851
Oh, this is horrible!

20:08.916 --> 20:10.730
Merry Christmas, Logan.

20:10.795 --> 20:12.873
Let's sled!

20:14.935 --> 20:16.897
Hey. This one's from Gram Gram.

20:16.991 --> 20:18.520
It's for all three of you.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.819
You don't have to open it
if you don't want to.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.448
- Mine! - Let me at it!
- Give me!

20:22.585 --> 20:23.741
Scarves?

20:23.819 --> 20:25.670
You guys can choose
which one you want.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.222
Flip a coin or fight it out.

20:27.299 --> 20:29.290
- Ooh. I want this one.
- That's the one I want.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.108
Well, it's mine.
So neither of you get it.

20:31.194 --> 20:32.894
Wait, you all want that one?

20:32.971 --> 20:35.590
Yeah. It's creepy,
but it tells a story.

20:35.655 --> 20:37.426
The other two just look
like Gram Gram bought them

20:37.491 --> 20:39.686
- at a store.
- A boring scarf store.

20:39.788 --> 20:41.788
Um, I wouldn't say it was
"boring." It's just a...

20:41.858 --> 20:44.311
- They love my scarf, Bob.
- Yeah, they do.

20:44.390 --> 20:45.418
You know
what this means?

20:45.483 --> 20:46.864
I'm better at knitting
than you

20:46.929 --> 20:49.254
- I knew it. Stick to burgers.
- Oh, my God.

20:49.319 --> 20:50.917
I made it!
I made that!
