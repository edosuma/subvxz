00:01.085 --> 00:05.155
The Simpsons S19E05 (JABF16 )
Treehouse of Horror XVIII

00:05.660 --> 00:08.183
Hello.
Remember Halloween?

00:08.183 --> 00:09.428
It was last week.

00:09.584 --> 00:12.843
But here at the Simpson house,
we're still celebrating.

00:13.052 --> 00:18.235
Tonight, we have
three terrifying tales of the...

00:18.482 --> 00:19.612
Excuse me.

00:21.268 --> 00:24.543
Now, our first gory story is...

00:24.544 --> 00:26.579
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:28.894 --> 00:30.295
No fair.

00:30.538 --> 00:34.370
Can't anyone just watch the
show they're watching?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:49.764 --> 00:51.645
Dinner is served.

01:07.366 --> 01:10.327
Mmm. Developed by.

01:18.285 --> 01:19.579
Crème brulée!

01:19.709 --> 01:20.873
Crème brulée!

01:20.928 --> 01:21.753
Or, in English:

01:21.835 --> 01:22.923
Burnt cream!

01:23.147 --> 01:24.193
Burnt cream!

01:24.205 --> 01:24.971
Hold on.

01:24.977 --> 01:26.831
I still have to caramelize.

01:28.437 --> 01:30.090
Bart, go out to the shed

01:30.107 --> 01:31.992
and get some more butane!

01:33.856 --> 01:36.201
...butane this.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.260
What's that unearthly glow?

01:43.268 --> 01:46.760
The only sensible thing to do
is explore it on my own.

01:50.165 --> 01:50.810
Huh?

01:55.847 --> 01:57.591
Oh, my God.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.623
An alien...

01:58.625 --> 02:01.142
in our butane storage shed.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.591
Is that your space name?

02:03.597 --> 02:07.353
No, you hit me in
my 700 testicles.

02:07.906 --> 02:09.690
Why did you come
to our world?

02:09.698 --> 02:11.762
My friends and I came in peace

02:11.768 --> 02:13.822
to find your vulnerabilities

02:13.827 --> 02:14.823
and, um,

02:14.827 --> 02:17.292
shore them up
with more peace.

02:17.295 --> 02:18.121
Yes.

02:18.295 --> 02:21.143
Then I was accidentally
left behind...

02:21.147 --> 02:23.231
in a spirit of peace.

02:24.475 --> 02:25.591
Is that a ray gun?

02:25.598 --> 02:27.360
No, it's a...

02:27.535 --> 02:29.721
deodorant applicator.

02:29.836 --> 02:30.771
I'll just...

02:36.008 --> 02:38.240
Smells like a
summer breeze.

02:40.005 --> 02:43.343
So, this is my Krusty
dolll0o, Linguo,

02:43.357 --> 02:44.930
Iraq War Sergeant Activity

02:44.938 --> 02:46.131
with insufficient armor,

02:46.135 --> 02:48.042
Phonic Frog, cat skull,

02:48.046 --> 02:49.772
Jim Halterman bobblehead doll.

02:49.775 --> 02:51.072
He's a local car dealer.

02:51.075 --> 02:51.950
Hmm...

02:51.958 --> 02:54.300
do all humans
have such weak necks

02:54.308 --> 02:57.302
or just the one you call
"Jim Halterman"?

02:57.695 --> 02:59.282
Oh, my God, an alien.

02:59.297 --> 03:02.302
I'm going to blow Rachel
Goodman away at show-and-tell.

03:02.305 --> 03:04.152
No. If the government
finds out he's here,

03:04.155 --> 03:05.241
they'll dissect him.

03:05.245 --> 03:08.720
I only hope those scientists
leave me my mouth,

03:08.735 --> 03:10.381
so I may spread my message

03:10.385 --> 03:12.093
of peace through song.

03:12.096 --> 03:15.073
Peace...

03:15.077 --> 03:17.600
Peace, peace, peace

03:17.606 --> 03:19.250
From space.

03:19.258 --> 03:21.212
As this month's
rotating president

03:21.217 --> 03:24.071
of the Springfield
Future Scientists Club,

03:24.078 --> 03:26.120
may I say I'm sorry

03:26.127 --> 03:28.183
and is there anything
we can do to help?

03:28.185 --> 03:31.560
Well, I would
like to phone home

03:31.565 --> 03:34.083
to tell my family I'm okay.

03:35.517 --> 03:37.650
To do so, I would need
the following items.

03:37.656 --> 03:38.680
Get them now.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.393
Fiber-optic cable,

03:40.398 --> 03:42.313
uranium 235,

03:42.317 --> 03:43.870
two tickets to Avenue Q,

03:43.876 --> 03:45.813
seven billion body bags...

03:46.675 --> 03:47.511
Can I hammer that?

03:47.515 --> 03:47.941
No.

03:47.945 --> 03:48.763
Can I weld that?

03:48.768 --> 03:49.243
No!

03:49.245 --> 03:49.913
Can I tighten the...

03:49.915 --> 03:51.073
I said no!

03:51.078 --> 03:52.841
I thought we were supposed
to do this together.

03:52.848 --> 03:55.832
Actually, I do have an
important job for you.

03:55.837 --> 03:58.311
You can go get the
wrench I dropped.

03:58.946 --> 04:00.860
I'm helping! I'm helping!

04:01.006 --> 04:02.571
Way to getrid of Bart.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.980
He can be such a pest.

04:04.985 --> 04:07.030
You are very observant, Lisa.

04:07.037 --> 04:10.162
That's why I have
a special job for you.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.182
Go find out the
secret locations

04:12.185 --> 04:14.952
of your country'smissile
defense facilities.

04:14.958 --> 04:17.142
They were in yesterday's
New York Times.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.993
We'll be killing every human in two days

04:21.995 --> 04:25.032
We'll be killing every human in two days

04:25.038 --> 04:27.032
We will cook them, we will eat them

04:27.037 --> 04:29.141
'Cause that's the way to treat them...

04:29.145 --> 04:30.962
Oh, Ma-arge.

04:30.967 --> 04:32.663
Want some company?

04:33.175 --> 04:36.432
As always, silence means yes.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.021
How about a little
neck rub, baby?

04:41.018 --> 04:44.022
Now, how about the
neck of my butt?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.423
Oh-ho-ho!

04:46.436 --> 04:49.433
Someone's taking the highway
to the danger zone.

04:49.496 --> 04:52.802
Oh, Marge,your tentacles feel so good.

04:53.306 --> 04:54.633
Wait a minute.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.693
Why am I getting
words in edgewise?

05:00.268 --> 05:03.721
We can't have a space creature
living in our house.

05:03.726 --> 05:05.221
Go ahead. Say it.

05:05.228 --> 05:07.260
It's because I'm Jewish.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.600
No, no, no, some of
my best friends are...

05:09.607 --> 05:11.661
Fine, you can stay.

05:11.668 --> 05:12.511
Look!

05:12.596 --> 05:14.052
They're coming to get...

05:14.055 --> 05:14.701
what's your name?

05:14.715 --> 05:16.263
Kodos the Destroyer.

05:16.267 --> 05:16.750
Huh?

05:16.758 --> 05:17.520
Don't worry, son.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.920
I got a planto save your space doggy.

05:21.535 --> 05:23.001
Who is it?

05:23.075 --> 05:24.700
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

05:24.706 --> 05:25.931
that you're harboring an alien.

05:25.937 --> 05:27.282
Open this doorat once.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.993
Oh, I'm not decent.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.492
Let me throw something on.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.202
Can I help you, gentlemen?

05:35.388 --> 05:36.962
Uh, we know it'syou, Mr. Simpson.

05:36.965 --> 05:38.053
Now where is the alien?

05:38.055 --> 05:39.811
Wow, you guys are good.

05:39.816 --> 05:41.513
The alien's right here
in the living room.

05:43.755 --> 05:45.372
Ha! You missed 'em.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.060
Bart and our alien friend are

05:47.066 --> 05:49.300
hundreds of miles away by now.

05:52.976 --> 05:54.020
What do you weigh?

05:54.028 --> 05:55.330
Like a million pounds?

05:55.337 --> 05:56.931
More of meto love.

05:56.968 --> 05:57.871
After them!

05:58.907 --> 06:01.702
The South shall rise again.

06:14.735 --> 06:17.081
We can fly over them with
the power of love, right?

06:17.085 --> 06:20.253
Hmm... we could, or...

06:25.436 --> 06:26.803
You killed them.

06:26.807 --> 06:28.850
Well done, Columbo.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.142
That's right. We watch Columbo.

06:31.145 --> 06:34.563
It's on during rain-outs
of gleep-glop games.

06:36.197 --> 06:37.660
I'm just gonna take off now.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.475
I'm sure you have a lot
of calls to make.

06:39.476 --> 06:41.037
Foolish biped.

06:41.035 --> 06:42.399
It's not a phone.

06:42.399 --> 06:44.082
It's a space portal.

06:44.108 --> 06:46.343
Our shock troops will teleportin

06:46.345 --> 06:48.502
and eat everyone's heads,

06:48.508 --> 06:50.310
all thanks to you.

07:17.247 --> 07:18.331
What did I miss?

07:21.636 --> 07:22.501
Hop in, Bart.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.072
They're gonna let us kill one!

07:30.055 --> 07:32.681
Bart... friend?

07:39.228 --> 07:40.520
Homer... bored!

07:43.766 --> 07:45.892
I can't believe that
an alien who looked

07:45.896 --> 07:48.640
so evil turned out to be bad.

07:48.645 --> 07:51.311
Hmm. I guess you should
judge a book by its cover.

07:51.315 --> 07:53.223
Definitely, especially if you count

07:53.227 --> 07:55.223
the inside flap as part of the cover.

07:55.226 --> 07:57.252
It usually gives you a great idea

07:57.265 --> 07:58.621
of what the book's about.

07:58.628 --> 07:59.152
Quiet.

07:59.156 --> 08:01.093
We're missing the dissection!

08:01.095 --> 08:03.351
Actually, I'm still alive,

08:03.355 --> 08:05.422
so technically, it's vivisection.

08:05.426 --> 08:07.183
No one likes a know-it-all.

08:26.776 --> 08:30.020
You see, the problem
is we've grown apart.

08:30.026 --> 08:31.921
The problem is

08:31.928 --> 08:34.013
you don't share my interest

08:34.017 --> 08:35.332
in not being with you.

08:35.336 --> 08:36.241
Another thing:

08:36.246 --> 08:38.222
I don't knowwhere you go at night.

08:59.327 --> 09:00.923
Greetings, 241.

09:00.978 --> 09:03.032
Why does he always bring up my weight?

09:03.035 --> 09:05.593
I want you to eliminate this reporter,

09:05.597 --> 09:06.800
Kent Brockman.

09:06.806 --> 09:08.411
He found the gully where I dump

09:08.416 --> 09:09.862
electricity every summer

09:09.865 --> 09:11.053
to jack up prices.

09:11.056 --> 09:11.793
Don't worry, sir.

09:11.796 --> 09:13.150
I'll handle this cleanly,

09:13.158 --> 09:14.662
quietly and... Bart!

09:15.138 --> 09:15.832
What?

09:16.796 --> 09:18.803
Marge, I'm gonna behome late tonight.

09:18.807 --> 09:20.133
I'm going to, uh...

09:20.136 --> 09:23.782
Midnight Monkey
Madness at the zoo.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.252
Well, I won'tbe home, either.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.422
I'm, um...

09:26.435 --> 09:29.423
flipping overwheelbarrows in case it rains.

09:29.428 --> 09:31.623
Have funat your crazy-sounding thing.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.920
And you have fun at
your preposterous event.

09:33.926 --> 09:34.731
- Love ya.
- Love ya.

09:36.558 --> 09:37.902
And that was my drink.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.052
Ninth floor.

09:43.057 --> 09:44.283
Assassin's perch.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.111
Now all I have to do is think of a

10:01.116 --> 10:03.573
clever line before I pull the trigger.

10:04.327 --> 10:06.493
Oh, that's a perfect one.

10:06.495 --> 10:09.102
But I don't need to say it
out loud 'cause I'm by myself.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.491
Out of my way, mystery skank!

10:19.417 --> 10:21.772
Hey! Now I don't get paid!

10:23.848 --> 10:25.740
Hey, baby, hello.

10:35.366 --> 10:37.130
Now I'm mad!

10:38.368 --> 10:40.103
Now I'm...

10:50.197 --> 10:52.441
Marge is a professional assassin!

10:59.128 --> 11:01.831
You just can't get
Russian gangster blood out.

11:02.077 --> 11:03.112
Must be something they eat.

11:08.115 --> 11:09.331
Hey, what's that?

11:10.207 --> 11:11.600
A blender cozy.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.642
How was your Midnight
Monkey Madness?

11:17.038 --> 11:17.982
Great, great.

11:18.257 --> 11:21.101
I turned over so many wheelbarrows...

11:21.518 --> 11:22.540
Wait. That was your thing.

11:27.405 --> 11:28.100
Homie,

11:28.258 --> 11:30.772
I made you my killer lasagna.

11:31.338 --> 11:32.342
It's poison!

11:32.616 --> 11:34.401
Whatever you do, don't eat it.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.650
Okay, you' already eating it,
but don't finish it.

11:39.898 --> 11:41.793
Okay, you finished it,
but don't ask for...

11:41.886 --> 11:42.683
Seconds, please.

11:43.096 --> 11:44.311
You moron!
Just kill her!

11:44.605 --> 11:46.501
I'll kill her after dessert!

11:50.187 --> 11:52.053
You're a killer for hire!

11:52.185 --> 11:53.462
You ruined that pie!

11:55.508 --> 11:57.360
How could you not tell me
you were an assassin?

11:59.116 --> 12:00.290
How could you not tell me?

12:01.515 --> 12:03.041
I told you 20 times!

12:03.288 --> 12:04.172
You never listen!

12:04.756 --> 12:06.712
Well, they're not
as pretty as you, Marge.

12:26.717 --> 12:28.342
Listen, I...
Oh!

12:30.927 --> 12:31.813
Okay, here's the deal.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.413
I'll do the killing for hire,

12:33.578 --> 12:34.892
and you stay home with the kids.

12:36.718 --> 12:38.422
I get $50,000 a hit.

12:38.595 --> 12:39.643
How much do you make?

12:39.867 --> 12:41.872
I just get to keep
whatever's in the guy's wallet.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.660
All those nights I thought
you were out getting drunk,

12:47.917 --> 12:49.712
you were out killing people?!

12:50.046 --> 12:52.323
I was out getting drunk,
then killing people!

13:12.587 --> 13:13.412
Stop it!

13:13.556 --> 13:14.883
That's my favorite couch!

13:15.167 --> 13:16.732
Why do you think I'm kicking it?

13:20.745 --> 13:22.563
Are you guys fighting over us?

13:22.745 --> 13:24.232
Whatever we did, we're sorry.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.493
Sweeties...

13:28.398 --> 13:29.563
We weren't fighting.

13:29.766 --> 13:30.842
It sounded like you were.

13:30.998 --> 13:32.980
Who wants ice cream in bed?

13:33.097 --> 13:34.583
Ice cream! Ice cream!

13:34.748 --> 13:35.681
Dad's the best!

13:35.946 --> 13:38.531
Great! Now they're going to have
tummy aches tomorrow.

13:38.698 --> 13:40.842
And where will
"Super Dad" be then?

13:41.048 --> 13:42.391
At your funeral.

13:47.038 --> 13:50.001
We got a complaint from
an anonymous "neighborino"

13:50.166 --> 13:53.812
about an elaborately choreographed,
high-octane, ultra-fight.

13:55.087 --> 13:57.020
I would have taken a bribe.

13:58.628 --> 14:00.233
Oh, that was so hot!

14:00.486 --> 14:03.031
I love watching you do other guys!

14:03.278 --> 14:06.373
Mmm, I'd like to see you
do a guy sometime.

14:06.788 --> 14:08.282
That can be arranged.

14:18.695 --> 14:21.170
Oh, what a wonderful night.

14:23.918 --> 14:27.463
...so, killing people together
has really spiced things up

14:27.625 --> 14:28.643
in the bedroom.

14:28.876 --> 14:30.720
That's terrific,
but I called you here to discuss

14:30.878 --> 14:32.852
your son's misbehavior
on the school bus.

14:36.558 --> 14:37.872
Think of me on Pizza Fridays.

14:52.096 --> 14:53.351
Trick or treat!

14:53.695 --> 14:56.673
Beat it, weirdoes!
I don't do Halloween!

14:56.928 --> 14:59.152
You're supposed
to give us candy.

14:59.407 --> 15:01.401
I got your candy right here.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.893
Weirdoes!

15:05.105 --> 15:06.751
She empty-bagged us!

15:06.976 --> 15:07.920
What do we do now?

15:08.206 --> 15:08.950
Hear me out.

15:09.148 --> 15:11.943
It seems to me we gave her
a choice: trick or treat.

15:12.157 --> 15:14.073
She didn't give us a treat, so...

15:14.275 --> 15:16.022
Bart, where are
you heading with this?

15:16.256 --> 15:18.203
"Trick or Treat" isn't
just some phrase you chant

15:18.327 --> 15:20.202
mindlessly like The Lord's Prayer.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.693
It's an oral contract!

15:21.856 --> 15:23.872
You're right.
We've forgotten the old ways.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.572
The ways of rotten eggs
and soaped-up windows.

15:26.798 --> 15:28.320
I say we trick her!

15:28.545 --> 15:29.771
Trick her good!

15:30.177 --> 15:31.290
Yay!

15:39.058 --> 15:40.422
May I remind you that I'm

15:40.436 --> 15:41.800
your principal's mother?!

15:50.097 --> 15:52.560
I hope the next people
don't give us anything

15:52.738 --> 15:54.313
so we can trick them too!

15:54.548 --> 15:55.362
Why give 'em a choice?

15:55.547 --> 15:58.092
That trick was sweeter than any
treat we'll get tonight.

15:58.366 --> 16:00.630
I'm concerned we might be
heading down a slippery slope.

16:00.848 --> 16:02.160
What do you think, Nelson?

16:02.386 --> 16:04.243
Can't talk.
Lighting poo.

16:05.018 --> 16:07.241
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

16:07.698 --> 16:10.060
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

16:10.515 --> 16:12.711
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

16:13.266 --> 16:15.510
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

16:15.717 --> 16:17.392
<i>They're forming in straight line</i>

16:18.696 --> 16:20.160
<i>They're going through a tight wind</i>

16:21.337 --> 16:22.861
<i>The kids are losing their minds</i>

16:23.046 --> 16:24.643
<i>The blitzkrieg bop</i>

16:25.396 --> 16:27.682
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

16:36.358 --> 16:38.521
Excuse me, but this is not good!

16:38.696 --> 16:40.340
Oh, lighten up.
It's Halloween.

16:40.526 --> 16:42.420
A night for mischief and merriment.

16:43.957 --> 16:45.351
Trick-or-treat!
Lick my feet!

16:45.427 --> 16:47.502
! taem ttub-gip ekilsllems daeh ruoY

16:48.755 --> 16:50.951
Those monsters must be stopped!

16:51.257 --> 16:52.921
Perhaps, I can be
of some assistance.

16:56.696 --> 17:00.050
I've got something that will scare the
H-E-double sippy straws out of them.

17:03.525 --> 17:04.643
Hold still!

17:10.008 --> 17:12.242
How is this a prank?
Give me back my TV!

17:12.528 --> 17:13.742
I fed your fish.

17:13.905 --> 17:14.953
You overfed them!

17:15.156 --> 17:16.422
You're the worst one of all!

17:23.978 --> 17:27.193
Whoa! They turned the church
into a haunted house!

17:27.705 --> 17:29.422
"Scaredy cats not wanted"?

17:29.898 --> 17:31.071
Then I am wanted!

17:35.748 --> 17:37.092
Welcome to Heck House!

17:37.306 --> 17:38.680
You're about to discover

17:38.697 --> 17:40.071
what a life of sin will get you!

17:40.358 --> 17:42.442
Sin gets us something?
Awesome!

17:42.607 --> 17:44.203
I was just in it for the sin.

17:44.447 --> 17:45.492
Just get in there!

17:47.926 --> 17:50.002
Welcome to eternal darnation!

17:51.357 --> 17:53.653
May I have a clean American
newspaper, please,

17:53.838 --> 17:55.020
no "Doonesbury"?

17:55.305 --> 17:58.581
Wouldn't you rather have
a bikini magazine?

17:58.868 --> 18:00.502
I guess a little peek won't hurt me.

18:01.267 --> 18:02.451
No!

18:03.506 --> 18:05.851
He died as he lived--like a dork.

18:07.548 --> 18:10.300
No! The lesson here is
he's being punished

18:10.456 --> 18:11.940
for thinking women are beautiful!

18:14.618 --> 18:16.393
Please, Lord, grant me the power

18:16.537 --> 18:18.932
to psychologically torture them
into loving you.

18:23.995 --> 18:26.403
Behold, the
las-diddily-ast room

18:26.408 --> 18:28.812
of Ned Flanders's Hell House!

18:33.377 --> 18:34.270
I warned ya.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.743
And yet my punishment
is no less severe.

18:37.026 --> 18:37.822
That's odd.

18:47.798 --> 18:50.550
Springfield is rife
with the seven deadly sins!

18:50.858 --> 18:52.571
Starting with... gluttony!

19:02.955 --> 19:03.930
More bread, please.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.643
Anger!

19:09.417 --> 19:12.333
Why won't you work,
you stupid piece of junk?!

19:18.065 --> 19:20.931
I said, why won't you work?!

19:24.105 --> 19:25.310
Pride!

19:28.185 --> 19:31.433
Oh, why did I take pride
in my child's accomplishments?

19:32.387 --> 19:33.630
Sloth!

19:35.635 --> 19:37.450
I thought I was killed
by that magic spaghetti!

19:41.188 --> 19:42.391
And the rest!

19:43.467 --> 19:44.462
Lust!

19:47.148 --> 19:48.180
Greed!

19:50.487 --> 19:52.063
And envy!

19:52.338 --> 19:53.981
Oh, how I envy the crotchless.

19:54.206 --> 19:57.263
And this is where sinners spend
all of eternity!

20:01.368 --> 20:04.161
This is what you get
for stealing jokes?!

20:04.455 --> 20:06.203
I keep telling you: I'm Hindu!

20:06.487 --> 20:08.033
I regret... nothing.

20:08.235 --> 20:10.731
- Stop licking my junk!
- It's my junk, too!

20:13.136 --> 20:14.583
We'll never do any of those sins...

20:14.807 --> 20:15.901
I promise!

20:16.386 --> 20:19.333
All we'll do from now on
is pray and fight in wars.

20:20.837 --> 20:22.061
Well, then, my work is done.

20:23.466 --> 20:25.450
That concludes our Halloween
show for this year.

20:25.617 --> 20:27.453
I just want to say
that for watching this network,

20:27.567 --> 20:28.813
you're all going to hell!

20:28.986 --> 20:31.012
And that includes FX, Fox Sports,

20:31.215 --> 20:34.001
and our newest Devil's portal,
The Wall Street Journal.

20:34.287 --> 20:35.281
Welcome to the club!
