00:54.577 --> 00:57.313
wow. For once, I believe
you actually wrote something.

00:57.347 --> 00:59.949
And I also believe that you
should honestly consider

00:59.983 --> 01:01.984
never writing anything
ever again.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.852
Thanks, but I'm not interested
in the opinion of someone

01:04.888 --> 01:07.723
whose cultural significance
went out with hammer pants.

01:07.791 --> 01:10.559
Don't knock hammer pants.
They let a man move.

01:10.593 --> 01:12.127

What did you think, baby?

01:14.597 --> 01:15.597
I love it.

01:15.632 --> 01:19.001
It's as though, uh, janis
and alanis had a baby.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.136
Yeah, and they
put it a dumpster

01:21.204 --> 01:24.406

its pathetic little existence.

01:24.441 --> 01:25.474
wow!

01:25.508 --> 01:27.810
I'm gonna be thinking
about that all day.

the girl's heart,

02:04.547 --> 02:06.448
How did the interview
with my old lady go?

02:06.516 --> 02:07.683
It went.

02:07.717 --> 02:09.985
Yeah? What did, uh...
What did she say about me?

02:10.053 --> 02:11.654
She misses me, right?

02:11.688 --> 02:12.988
I-I mean,
at least in the sack.

02:13.056 --> 02:14.823
Well, I'll know more
when I see her again.

02:14.858 --> 02:15.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.926
Moody, I thought this thing
was, uh, over.

02:17.961 --> 02:19.128

02:19.195 --> 02:21.397

after I douche my ears.

02:21.431 --> 02:23.299
Well, go then.
Enjoy.

that is bullshit.

03:23.793 --> 03:25.194
He's just being dramatic.

03:25.261 --> 03:28.097
I don't mean as much to him
as he'd have you believe.

03:28.131 --> 03:29.231
I don't know, lady.

03:29.265 --> 03:31.600
To hear him tell it,
you're the one that got away.

03:31.635 --> 03:33.602
Ran away screaming
is more like it.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.571
What was he like
back then?

03:35.605 --> 03:40.276
Mm, I guess probably
the same as he is now --

03:40.310 --> 03:41.543
A lost boy.

03:41.578 --> 03:45.180
Sweet, well-intentioned,
loves the women...

03:45.215 --> 03:46.448
hmm.
A little too much.

03:46.483 --> 03:49.652
What makes him so good, then?
What do you think?

03:49.686 --> 03:51.053
You know what?
He listens.

03:51.121 --> 03:53.422
He hears things in a song
that no one else can.

03:53.456 --> 03:54.923
So, what was
the last straw?

03:54.958 --> 03:56.859
None of your business.

03:56.893 --> 04:00.529
Janie jones, I do believe the
man is still in love with you.

04:00.597 --> 04:02.264
His sun rises and sets
with you.

04:02.332 --> 04:04.767
I think that he would toss
everything he's got

04:04.801 --> 04:06.635
just to get another shot
with you.

04:06.703 --> 04:07.736
<i>That's what i believe.</i>

04:10.273 --> 04:11.573
You know what?

04:11.608 --> 04:13.976
We were in the middle
of living our happily-ever-after

04:14.010 --> 04:15.878
when I walked in on him
one day writing a song

04:15.912 --> 04:18.613
with a sheryl crow wannabe.

04:18.682 --> 04:21.116
And I don't know.
I just freaked out.

04:21.151 --> 04:23.752
I mean, it was more intimate
than fucking.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.254
And I know he always said

04:25.288 --> 04:28.424
that he had to fall in love
with everyone he worked with.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.159
He had to open himself up
to the music.

04:30.193 --> 04:33.629
But I guess I just...

04:33.663 --> 04:36.265
Got sick of sharing him.

04:36.299 --> 04:37.600
So I bailed.

04:37.634 --> 04:39.168
Does that make me
superficial?

04:41.071 --> 04:43.105
No. Just human.

04:43.139 --> 04:44.373
Well, look at this.

04:44.407 --> 04:47.643
It looks like you got the
happily-ever-after after all.

04:47.677 --> 04:49.612
Damn straight.

04:49.679 --> 04:50.980
Don't you want to talk
to him?

04:51.047 --> 04:53.148
Just out of curiosity.
Don't you Miss him a little bit?

04:53.216 --> 04:54.850
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I Miss him.

04:54.884 --> 04:56.752
Like you'd miss
a bad case of the crabs

04:56.786 --> 04:58.153
if you got them from
robert plant

04:58.188 --> 04:59.722
or jesus or someone.

04:59.756 --> 05:00.923
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:00.991 --> 05:02.758
This is a little-known fact
about jesus --

05:02.792 --> 05:04.059
He was well known
for his v.d.

05:04.127 --> 05:06.795
He made the ladies itch all the
way from galilee to nazareth.

you're just like him.

I get that a lot.

05:11.301 --> 05:12.501

What are you,

05:22.912 --> 05:26.081
You ruined a perfectly good
glass of scotch.

05:26.116 --> 05:27.383
Get back in here.
The water's warm.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.752
And I believe we should do
a little synchronized swimming.

05:29.786 --> 05:31.720
No, I think
that's enough for one day.

<i>I have revealed way more
than I thought I should.</i>

05:35.025 --> 05:37.092

How'd you'd do that?

05:37.127 --> 05:39.295
It's what I do.
It's a gift.

19:59.623 --> 20:01.323
ahh.

20:01.358 --> 20:02.658
Ooh. What is
this stuff?

20:02.692 --> 20:04.460
Okay.
H-here's the deal.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.831
See, my 57-second performance
in "vaginatown"

20:08.898 --> 20:10.866
was no one-time thing.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.001
You come...

20:12.035 --> 20:13.435
Rather quickly.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.670
You poor baby!

20:14.704 --> 20:16.739
No, no, no!
I'm lucky --

20:16.773 --> 20:18.107
Lucky to live in an age

20:18.141 --> 20:20.542
when there are
various tools available

20:20.577 --> 20:23.345
of which those of my ilk
can avail themselves.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.915
See, there is numbing cream.
That's good stuff.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.984
Uh, extra-thick condoms...

20:29.019 --> 20:30.185
Anal beads?

20:30.220 --> 20:32.221
Oh, no.
They shouldn't be in this box.

20:32.255 --> 20:34.556
Those puppies make me come
like a fire hose.

20:35.725 --> 20:38.761
Hey. Hey!

20:38.795 --> 20:39.962
Okay.

20:39.996 --> 20:42.598
You are not gonna need
any of that stuff with me.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.068
w--
Hey, what are you doing?!

20:46.102 --> 20:48.304
Look, I can't
see you naked yet.

20:48.338 --> 20:49.705
Okay.

20:49.739 --> 20:51.740
I'm gonna
coach you through this.

20:51.775 --> 20:53.776
Cock control
is mainly mental.

20:53.843 --> 20:57.413
So, what is your
most embarrassing teen moment?

20:57.447 --> 21:00.282
High school.
State debate championship.

21:00.350 --> 21:03.519
Yeah, I was ahead,
and then I popped a boner.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.254
So just think about that.

21:05.288 --> 21:07.523
No good.
I shame-jizz.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.791
Okay.

21:08.825 --> 21:10.859
I'll just do
the yonic pretzel.

21:10.927 --> 21:13.262
What the fuck
is a yonic pretzel?

21:13.330 --> 21:14.997
It's like
a negative kegel.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.765
A negative what?
Okay.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.133
It's just complicated
vagina shit.

21:18.168 --> 21:20.302
Every time you think
you're gonna blow,

21:20.337 --> 21:21.537
just pinch me.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.739
And then that'll be my cue
to pretzel, okay?

21:23.773 --> 21:25.074
I don't know.

21:25.108 --> 21:26.642
Trust me.

21:26.676 --> 21:31.213
<i>You believed in me,
and i believe in you.</i>

21:31.247 --> 21:34.850
I'm gonna
get you through this.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.327
mm.

21:45.395 --> 21:47.896
Here.
Me? Okay. Yeah.

21:47.931 --> 21:51.133
A little anaesthetic
never hurt.

21:53.136 --> 21:55.237
[ sighs ]
and you're right.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.605
I am an asshole.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.906
I know.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.910
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say that mia is an old soul,

22:01.945 --> 22:02.978
but...

22:03.046 --> 22:07.049
She is charming...

22:07.117 --> 22:09.418
Witty, and gorgeous.

22:09.486 --> 22:12.488
Yes, but she's less
than half your age, lew.

22:12.522 --> 22:14.890
Okay, but by the time charming,
witty, and gorgeous women

22:14.924 --> 22:17.092
get to be my age,
they want nothing to do with me.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.662
Okay, so that's your rationale.
That's okay.

22:19.696 --> 22:21.964
No, it's true.
Take yourself, for example.

22:21.998 --> 22:23.899
I mean, you've had your share
of man-children.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.501
Excuse me!
Woo-hoo!

22:25.568 --> 22:27.870
Um, you'd see me coming
a mile away, right?

22:27.904 --> 22:28.904
Mm-hmm.

22:28.939 --> 22:31.840
Man's got a point.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.310
But I guess I wouldn't
have seen you coming at 17,

22:34.344 --> 22:36.345
which is why
we protect our children.

22:36.413 --> 22:37.780
Okay. Okay.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.348
The whole age thing's
a real sticking point with you.

22:39.382 --> 22:40.983
No --
Geez.
Hey, forgive a guy.

22:41.017 --> 22:42.251
Can you just forgive a guy?

22:42.285 --> 22:43.419
I mean, surely,

22:43.453 --> 22:45.621
there's other older men
that have dated mia, right?

22:45.655 --> 22:47.356
no.
Not as far as I know.

22:47.390 --> 22:49.692
<i>And if you did know?
I don't know.</i>

22:49.726 --> 22:50.859
If they were like you,

22:50.894 --> 22:53.128
I wouldn't speak with them
ever again.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.396
Interesting.

22:54.431 --> 22:56.198
What's interesting?

22:56.232 --> 22:59.668
Well, 'cause we're
truth-telling, um...

23:01.438 --> 23:03.105
What?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.307
Nothing.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.809
Uh, I...

23:06.843 --> 23:08.777
I take women
as they come to me.
Oh, that's --

23:08.812 --> 23:12.114
Any woman who is kind enough
to have me, I don't question.

23:12.148 --> 23:14.316
That's beautiful. That's --
That's nice of you, lew.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.318
I missed a little bit.
I --

23:19.389 --> 23:21.156
What the fuck?!

23:21.191 --> 23:22.324
[ laughs ]

23:22.359 --> 23:24.627
I thought I saw
a green light there. I did.

23:24.661 --> 23:26.562
no.
No, absolutely.

23:26.596 --> 23:28.230
W-what?

23:28.298 --> 23:30.933
I've got to go.
You're insane.

23:31.001 --> 23:32.368
[ door opens ]

23:32.402 --> 23:34.069
call me.
[ door closes ]

23:34.104 --> 23:36.071
[ chuckles ]

23:36.106 --> 23:39.675
[ breathing heavily ]

23:39.709 --> 23:40.843
wow.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.779
your jedi clam tricks
really work.

23:43.847 --> 23:44.780
Yeah?

23:44.848 --> 23:46.715
Yeah.
I'm really doing it.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.250
Staying in the game.

23:48.318 --> 23:49.985
My penis is still
in your vagina.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.388
Way to go, champ!

23:54.691 --> 23:57.159
Holy shit!

23:57.193 --> 23:59.061
I'm king
of fuck mountain!

23:59.095 --> 24:00.262
I could go for days!

24:00.330 --> 24:03.499
<i>Oh, well, um, that's not
totally necessary.</i>

24:03.533 --> 24:05.768
Oh, it's no problem.
You just enjoy yourself.

24:05.802 --> 24:07.236
I'm actually
a little sore.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.906
Oh. That's cool.
Coming is my favorite part.

24:10.941 --> 24:12.875
Well, you earned it.

24:12.943 --> 24:15.110
Okay. Go!

24:15.145 --> 24:17.012
[ telephone ringing ]
go!

24:17.047 --> 24:19.848
okay, please
don't pick that up.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.383
I'm chafing.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.253
<i>Charlie, it's ilene.
Where the hell is my daughter?</i>

24:24.321 --> 24:26.288
<i>she doesn't pick up.
She doesn't call.</i>

24:26.323 --> 24:27.323
<i>What the fuck, runkle?!</i>

24:27.357 --> 24:29.625
<i>she had manners
before she married you.</i>

24:29.659 --> 24:30.826
<i>[ receiver clicks ]</i>

24:30.860 --> 24:32.828
son of a bitch!

24:32.862 --> 24:34.596
[ door closes ]

24:34.631 --> 24:36.498
hey, it's the littlest
of the moodys.

24:36.533 --> 24:39.268
I got some sushi. Play some
guitar hero. What do you say?

24:39.302 --> 24:40.736
Maybe some
other time, dad.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.472
No, no, no, no, no. I got
the kind with the paper boats.

24:43.506 --> 24:45.007
You love you
some paper boats.

24:45.075 --> 24:46.241
I'm meeting damien.

24:46.309 --> 24:48.510
Oh, no. Oh, ohh.

24:48.545 --> 24:50.412
You know,
fuck that harry chapin.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.815
Prophetic bastard --
"cat's in the cradle."

24:52.849 --> 24:54.083
Motherfucker.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.085
I should have
picked her up.

24:56.119 --> 24:58.487
Right.
Well, it's not her loss.

24:58.555 --> 25:02.358
You know, um, you had your
chance, and now you don't, so...

25:03.827 --> 25:05.327
Oh, yeah.
You want sushi?

25:05.395 --> 25:07.129
no.
Uh, would that I could.

25:07.163 --> 25:10.065
I-I have to go meet sonja and,
um, your best friend

25:10.100 --> 25:11.934
at the gallery
at the bergamot.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.569
Oh, the bearded bozo?
Mm-hmm.

25:13.603 --> 25:15.804
Well, take some with.
I got way too much. I got...

25:15.872 --> 25:17.806
I got like 20 pounds.
Oh, no. You know,
it doesn't travel so well.

25:17.841 --> 25:18.941
...paper boats.
Thank you.

25:18.975 --> 25:22.177
But you could, you know,
just make yourself at home

25:22.245 --> 25:24.179
and -- and --
And lock up after.

25:24.214 --> 25:28.183
Well, yeah.
This used to be my home once.

25:28.218 --> 25:32.054
And I used to be
your girl once.

25:33.590 --> 25:36.125
Okay.
Hey, about, um...

25:36.159 --> 25:38.427
You know, the mia thing
with ashby.

25:38.461 --> 25:39.395
oh.
I'll take care of it.

25:39.462 --> 25:40.896
I'm gonna protect her.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.565
Oh. It's already
taken care of.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.135
No, no. It's unforgivable.
She's still a kid.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.202
Uh-huh.
I took care of it.

25:47.237 --> 25:48.470
how?
How did you do that?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.572
I mean, the guy's an animal,
a moving train.

25:50.607 --> 25:52.408
He's pure id.

25:52.475 --> 25:56.178
Yeah, you're right.
Um...

25:56.212 --> 25:58.580
But he is a great kisser,
so...

25:58.615 --> 25:59.448
What?

26:01.117 --> 26:03.619
Wha--
I think you heard me.

26:03.653 --> 26:05.020
I --
Mm-hmm.

26:05.055 --> 26:10.626
<i>So, if you'll excuse me, i have
to go see a man about a horse.</i>

the decision's already made? ¶
