00:50.200 --> 00:54.200
Subbed by ZR_IVEDIK

02:36.000 --> 02:38.400
Grandma!

02:43.600 --> 02:44.800
Who is it?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.200
It's me, your grandson Recep Ivedik.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.700
Password?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Password, uhh... The crops come up to my thigh,
which is a little unfortunate for me...

02:54.200 --> 02:57.200
...since I'd like to show you something
between my groin and knee...

02:57.400 --> 02:59.300
That's last year's password!.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.900
But it's still something
to do with crops, right?

03:02.200 --> 03:04.700
Ummm...,
Before the wheat begins to bud...

03:04.900 --> 03:06.100
...the blind calf... the blind calf...

03:06.100 --> 03:10.100
...the blind calf does not limp!

03:10.800 --> 03:13.400
Ah yes, A blind calf does not limp
before the crops sprout.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.000
Alright alright, let me in!.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.700
Fucking Adriano, Make the pass!
 Pissing me off again!

03:23.000 --> 03:25.700
Grandma, maybe instead of playing with Inter...

03:25.900 --> 03:27.300
...better if you chose Manchester...
because they have Rooney.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.300
Oy! You're sitting on
my precious trunk!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.800
Get off!
Get your fat arse off it now!

03:35.100 --> 03:36.800
Get up, get up!

03:37.000 --> 03:40.200
Look, I've brought you
the game you wanted and some flowers.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.200
Come on, why do you
treat me like this?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.600
Why do you always buy me
a bunch of daisies?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.800
...can't you buy a bonsai tree
or a golden coltsfoot?

03:47.400 --> 03:49.900
And where am I supposed to find
a bonsai or a coltsfoot grandma?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.400
You picked these up from the cemetry.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.200
What?
You're breaking my heart!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
- Get up from there!
- Take your flowers!

03:56.600 --> 03:59.200
Get up.
Sit there in front of me.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.700
You must never sit
on this trunk.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.400
This trunk, it's what I hold
most precious.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.300
Goddammit, I don't see what's so
precious about it!

04:08.500 --> 04:10.900
You'll see what's in it
when I'm dead, and not before.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.500
This trunk holds nothing of
interest to you anyway.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.100
I forbid you,
and that's that.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.300
I'll die without seeing it.
God, you're such an animal!

04:19.500 --> 04:21.500
I wonder which farm your
parents bought you from.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.400
That's a bit too far.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
And no one has any idea what
job you do.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.400
You act like the bigshot
of the neighbourhood.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.400
You beat everyone up.
Everyone complains about you!

04:29.600 --> 04:30.800
You're really bothering me.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.900
Me, I follow a philosophy when it comes to
these matters. Like I always say...

04:34.100 --> 04:37.600
Before the wheat begins to bud
the calf does not limp.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.300
I keep repeating it
so that I can get it into your fat head.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.600
Think about it when you're doing something,
maybe write it on your wall.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.000
Look over there!
Do you know who that is?

04:48.200 --> 04:51.400
That's your grandfather, a wrestler,
a man well-built like a bear.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.600
At the time of Sultan Hamit,
he founded an advertising agency.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.800
And do you know who runs
this agency now?

04:59.200 --> 05:01.000
Hakan, the son of your uncle.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.300
That brat Hakan?

05:02.500 --> 05:06.200
Yes Hakan the brat. You should follow his example.
Why don't you be more like him?.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Grandma, I'm going to
speak frankly.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.800
That wanker Hakan, who can't get it up? I want
nothing to do with him.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.500
I'll never take a share
from that impotent bastard.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.600
Oh, I wish I could finally see you
become somebody.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.600
...if I could see
a nice girl at your side...

05:17.800 --> 05:20.000
When will I see it?
At this rate I'll die without seeing it.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.900
Why, are you gay?
You're a homo?

05:22.100 --> 05:23.900
Listen Grandma,
don't talk so shamelessly.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.700
By God, if you were not my grandmother
I would already have broken your jaw.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.400
You're a bad guy, get lost.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.800
Do you even know
why I called you here?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.600
And why else would you call me?
I'm here now aren't I?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.900
I bought you the game you wanted.
The flowers you wanted.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.900
It's not as though I came empty-handed.
And all you do is yell at me.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.500
I'm asking three things of you.
No more.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400
Ask away. You always
want something.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.800
You're going to find
a job and work.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.800
Wait wait, let me write this down.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
If I don't I'll forget.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.400
May dogs piss on your head!
Come on, make sure you remember what I say.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Tell me.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.900
One, you're going to find a job,
you need to work.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.700
A job, Listen, you're annoying me
with these tales of work.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.700
...you're wasting your time.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.600
Work is not included in
my genes. My DNA is out of order. What can I do?

06:06.100 --> 06:08.900
Two, you're going to get married.
And produce offspring.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.000
'You're going to get married' she says.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.400
It's easy for you to say.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.900
Me too, but for the last
32 years...

06:16.100 --> 06:17.500
I've been using my hand.
I'm bored of it.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.600
Of course
I'd like to have a wife. But how? 

06:19.800 --> 06:22.900
Three, you're going to gain respect,
you're going to be a good guy.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
I'm going to win respect.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.800
I'm already highly respected,
so that's easy.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.900
In fact, whenever I go out
into the neighbourhood...

06:30.100 --> 06:31.800
...all the people stand up...

06:32.000 --> 06:33.700
straight to attention.

06:33.900 --> 06:38.200
I've told you three things. Don't dare coming back
home without completing them.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
Ok, I'll do it.
I'll think of something.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
Don't come back here until
you're a somebody. Now get lost!.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.800
Fine, I'll go
do what you want.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I've promised to do it,
but you natter on.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.700
I even bought you a nice little PlayStation
so you can occupy yourself.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.600
Yet you're still on my case,
you don't let me go.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.800
Then why are you still sitting there
like some honoured guest?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Get up, get the fuck out of here!

06:55.200 --> 06:56.600
Oh, you're insults are so painful.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.900
Fuck off!
Get out!

06:59.100 --> 07:00.500
Fine, fine.
I'm going.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.300
I will do whatever you want.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.200
You fucking animal, piss off!

07:06.700 --> 07:10.500
Oh man, where do I begin with this work thing?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.100
God, all I want is to peacefully sit here
in front of this window.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.900
...and quietly watch
the people go by. Now look at me.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.000
I can't do that.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
I'll try that.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.300
Hello, I'm calling about your ad.
Where are you located?

07:31.700 --> 07:34.700
Actually, Tuzla is
a bit too far for me.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.800
Can't you come to my house,
in Güngören?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.900
What, how can you say that as a boss?.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.600
...you can't come
to the house of an employee?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.900
Why the hell not? What,
do you hate your employees now?

07:46.100 --> 07:50.000
No, I can't come to Tuzla.Fuck you and your job!

07:50.200 --> 07:52.500
Just because a guy gives employment
he expects everyone to come to his feet.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.400
Come here and tell me which job
you're going to give me.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.300
We're looking for a domestic pet.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.100
Hmm, would that fit me?

07:59.600 --> 08:01.200
I am an animal,
but not domesticated.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.200
No my friend.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
No chance.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.000
Not at all.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.500
Get lost.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.600
No way.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.900
That's possible.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.600
Hello!

08:18.200 --> 08:19.800
No it's not Ali, I said hello.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.500
I have a lot of experience.
I am an expert in pedicure.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.900
I cut my own toenails.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.200
And then I lick
the parts that are white.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.500
Me, I don't mind.
I've even licked the feet of women.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.299
Who is it that I'm speaking to?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.600
Who are you?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.000
I give up. Who are you?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.100
It's me that called you.
Who are you?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.200
I'll break your face.
Where are you, eh?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.900
Listen, don't insult me.
Otherwise I'll break your mouth.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.700
I'll insult you even more.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.500
[Enraged] Enough words!
Come on then, come to Güngören,if you want some! 

08:50.500 --> 08:54.500
Come on then, come to Güngören!

08:54.700 --> 08:56.400
Come to Güngören and you'll see.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.800
Hello, I'm calling about the ad.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.300
I can't do this job,
I can't. Thank you very much.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.600
I called,
but I can't do it, thank you.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.900
I'm calling about your ad. Apparently
you're looking for someone.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.800
Hold on, stop!

09:10.000 --> 09:13.200
Look no further, I am the one
you're looking for my friend.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.700
Good evening.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.600
I come from Copernicus Pizzas.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
As it says on my badge
the pizzas are the hottest in the galaxy.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I've brought a copernicus pizza.

09:42.400 --> 09:49.500
Pizza Kopernik, Kopernik, the
hottest pizzas in the galaxy...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.800
Pizza... Pizza...Kopernik.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.400
Okay, okay, I get it.
Give me my order.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.700
Sorry, that's what
they teach us. Here take that.

10:02.600 --> 10:07.100
You've made a good choice.
Congratulations, you're a smart guy.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
Give me.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.100
How much does it come to?

10:11.300 --> 10:13.700
Now you ask, huh?
Let me see how much my boss ripped you off by...

10:14.200 --> 10:16.900
28.70 but for you it's only 14.35.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.300
And why's that?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.600
Well, when I was coming in, you know,
it smelled so good.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
And you know I couldn't help myself.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.600
Because I'm a small guy I got scared
when I opened the pizza.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.500
I swear I haven't touched yours,
I just ate the one that comes free in the promo.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.200
That won't do.
I want another one.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.600
Listen friend.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.300
This is my first delivery,
you're not going to make a fool out of me, ok?

10:34.500 --> 10:37.200
Go, eat it if you want. I don't want that,
I want you to bring me an entire pizza.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.600
What, is this half a pizza then?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.600
And what will you do with an entire pizza?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.200
Look at you, you're overeating anyway!
You look like a bear.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.600
What's wrong with
sharing one with me?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.600
Besides, I only brought one pizza.
It's the other one in the promo that I ate.

10:49.800 --> 10:50.900
What's your problem?

10:51.100 --> 10:54.300
Come on, tell me,
what's your problem, huh?

10:54.900 --> 10:57.400
Is it because you're fatter than you are
selfish?

10:57.600 --> 10:59.400
What's wrong with sharing your
pizza with me?.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.700
God Almighty...

11:00.900 --> 11:03.800
Obviously it's because you're so stingy
you ended up weighing a tonne.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.800
Even if you stopped eating for
three months you wouldn't die.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
Don't bother giving me the money.

11:09.700 --> 11:13.000
Curse you, you fat, selfish, stingy bastard!

11:13.200 --> 11:15.800
Don't worry about paying, you dirty,
selfish cheapskate.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.800
A selfish cheapskate who doesn't share.
Bastard!

11:22.900 --> 11:26.500
What, are you crazy or something? Is this
how we treat our customers?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.400
What's more,
you ate the guy's pizzas!

11:29.600 --> 11:31.400
But I needed to eat,
did you want me to die?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
You're a funny guy.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.600
The man wanted to make a formal complaint.
I had such difficulty dissuading him.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.000
Boo hoo, I'm scared,
I'm pissing myself scared.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.600
I'm firing you.
Hand in your uniform and get out.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.100
Fuck you, I quit.
Here, take this.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.100
I'll have it.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.500
Here's your machine. Whoops, it fell
out of my hands.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.600
- I'll take that.
- Take your pizza as well.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.300
- And take your helmet too.
- Go away, scram!

12:04.500 --> 12:07.100
What kind of guy are you?
Fuck off!

12:08.100 --> 12:10.100
- I'm going to break your mouth.
- Get out of here!

12:18.200 --> 12:21.700
Come my friends, get in single file.
This way my dear.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.600
Now everyone put your hand on the
shoulder of the person in front.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.500
Oy put your hand up, redhead.
Put your hand there.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.400
Good, now you'll stay
in single file. Like a train.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.800
This is Cash Express here.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Just like the Anatolia Express,
I want to see all of you.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.000
Hey, be disciplined.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.100
Look at that, too many calories.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.700
Yes, unfortunately.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.800
After you eat that like an ogre
you won't be able to get yourself up.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.500
Sit in your armchair all day, and wonder
why you weigh a hundred kilos?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.100
Today I get a bunch of donkeys.
What can I do?

12:51.300 --> 12:54.000
Take your bags, give me the money.
You fat bitch.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.500
You gave me too much, take the extra.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.100
I know what I gave.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.000
Okay, I'll put your change
in the tip-box.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.600
Your salt! You forgot your salt.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.300
In the evening, your husband will say
the food has no salt, go away.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.900
Welcome.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.600
Ah grape molasses, eh? Tahini, eh
big boy? Very good.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.400
Motex love... Well, well big boy.
Some man on man action tonight or what?

13:17.900 --> 13:21.600
Where is my squirrel?
Where is my caterpillar?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.300
You're having a mixed salad
this evening? There's a match tonight, huh?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.600
You'll be smuggling some meat tonight?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.000
What meat smuggling?

13:29.500 --> 13:30.800
Yes, you've taken extra large as well.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.300
Isn't this too big for you now?
I heard you had a tiny willy.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.300
Isn't it going to be too big for you?
If not, you could wear it on your body instead.[Laughs]

13:42.000 --> 13:43.700
I'd better pay and go quickly.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.300
Ha, he says he's got a match tonight.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.100
That's 10.70.
But I'll charge you 20.70.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.100
Go on, get out you rascal.
He's having a melee tonight.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.900
Listen, don't use the
menthol flavour, it burns.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
And keep your strength up in your dick.
Like that.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.500
[Makes motor sounds] Like an engine.
Ok big boy? Tatak tatak.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.300
Bravo to you.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.900
He lives in my neighbourhood.
He didn't go into puberty until the age of 27.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.800
At 25 he didn't even have a single hair
under his arms, the idiot.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.700
He buys 3-4 packets every day.
You ask him what he does with them?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.300
You ask him, is there a girl? No.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.100
What he does with all those,
I don't know. Probably makes them into balloons

14:22.300 --> 14:24.400
and launches them.

14:24.600 --> 14:30.200
Pear, banana, avocado, aubergine.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.000
Hey, young man.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Yes boss.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.600
Since this morning, all I've got are
complaints about you.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.400
Really?
What complaints?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.400
About everything. Heck, someone even wanted
to beat you up.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
Go on, get out of here quick,
and hand in your ID.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
I'm firing you, get out.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.100
Listen, it's me who's resigning, ok?

14:48.300 --> 14:50.400
For God's sake... Go on, hurry up.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.300
Go on? Go on?
I'm gonna stuff this leek down your throat.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.900
- Fuck you!.
- I'll make you eat this leek.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.600
Fuck off out of here, you mental case.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.100
I've never seen such a headcase in my life,
what a nutter!.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.600
Finally, when the guy told me
to hurry and all that...

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
...that made me mad, so I handed in
my resignation, and I left.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Lord Almighty, as if they'll eat up your resignation.
You resign and feel so proud of yourself.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
Do you know what you've done?
I'd rather not say what I think of you right now...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.700
I won't let them trample on
my honour and my pride like that, ok?

15:17.900 --> 15:21.000
If you had any honour
or pride you'd still be working.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.200
Alright then, tomorrow I'll try
the medical sector.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.800
Ah yes, you try that.
And see if you can kill anyone while you're at it.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.700
Go on, get out.
Actually, come, let's play a match.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
I need to fuck you up at PES
to get you thinking..

15:32.100 --> 15:33.200
At PES?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.500
Come, get up.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.100
You look very sure of yourself.

15:36.300 --> 15:36.900
I am very sure of myself.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.300
I'll give you a thrashing.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.100
Come on then, we'll see who beats who.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.200
Oy, don't put that there!

15:42.400 --> 15:43.100
What does it matter?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.900
How many times have I told you
to never touch that?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.500
That's my precious trunk you're sitting on again,
it's more valuable than you are.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.300
Good God, look at that
you made me spill my soup!

15:49.500 --> 15:50.700
I will kill you, don't do that.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.000
My God, what a tackle, you fucked me over there,
look at that.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.600
I'm gonna waste you.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.500
Go on, start.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.000
Who shall I play with,
which team is that?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.600
You're gonna be Inter?

16:12.600 --> 16:13.700
Good morning.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.700
My God! An enormous buffalo!.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.400
Oh excuse me,
I panicked a bit.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.500
What do you have?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.200
Are you pregnant?

16:24.200 --> 16:25.600
Was it external fertilisation,
what is it?

16:25.900 --> 16:27.300
I'm constipated.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.400
- Since when?
- 7-8, maybe 9 days.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.700
I can't imagine
the state of your bowels!

16:40.900 --> 16:44.400
The smell, the excess gas!.
The stench, it flows through everything.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.500
My stomach is gone!
You've caught a viral trend.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.700
It must be chronic diarrhoea...

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
Ah, you're panicking, as well you might.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.100
It's a very painful disease.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.200
Look, first the vessels of the
umbilical partition will die...

17:01.400 --> 17:05.000
...and then through that hole they call the umbilicus,
your faeces will emerge...

17:05.200 --> 17:08.500
...that's advanced medical language-
you will better know it as 'shit'...

17:08.700 --> 17:11.000
It will all flow out onto your bed,
like so.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.099
I will recommend
an alternative medicine.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.500
Rectal suppository! It's a good alternative.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.099
You know how to use it?

17:20.300 --> 17:21.200
I know.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.200
Let me explain, so that
everything is perfectly clear.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.900
Everything should be clear to the patient.

17:27.099 --> 17:32.500
If not, we'll end up with people trying
to swallow it with water. Now pay attention

17:33.800 --> 17:35.200
Tell me, what is this?

17:38.700 --> 17:39.800
What is it?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.600
Your view would be from here.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.700
There are two massive butt-cheeks.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.600
Normally they're a bit smaller.
With you they're like this.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.200
Yours are more separated, etc. not normal.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.800
I'll describe it later.
It's like this.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.800
Take some vaseline,
like so, take a generous amount.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.300
Lubricate it well with your hands.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.300
Now, the suppository.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.000
The beginning is a bit rough, but the end is smooth.
You take it, you put the tip here.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
The beginning is a bit rough, but the end is smooth.
You take it, you put the tip here

18:09.200 --> 18:13.000
What kind of a man are you,
you crazy or what?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.200
Come madam,
I'm going to help you out.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.000
Help me, so help me!

18:17.200 --> 18:19.900
You should be ashamed to work with
such a pervert as him!

18:22.900 --> 18:26.400
Dear Neriman.
She was putting it all on.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.900
Excuse me, but she had 9 tonnes of
dried shit in her stomach.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.400
She asks us to help, then treats us
so rudely, so perverse!

18:32.600 --> 18:36.400
But you're a rude man,
you're too insensitive.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.500
Alright look, I understand where you're going here.

18:40.700 --> 18:44.300
Take this off me,
there, take my coat.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.400
I'm handing in my pledge
of prostate here.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.400
Take the suppository. I'm handing in
my resignation and I'm going.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.500
Go on!

19:10.800 --> 19:13.100
In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
Let's go.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.500
God I swear I've got diarrhoea
because of the motions.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.500
And the increased atmospheric
pressure to boot, you know.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.800
...it's gonna blow my pants off.
Has it ever happened to you?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.800
No. Never mind, try and forget it
for now.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.700
I'll oversee the economy class section.
And you can take care of Business Class.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.700
Business Class?

19:29.900 --> 19:32.900
Yes, Business Class is upto the curtain.
It's for businessmen.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.800
Ah, on this side of the curtain we have notables,
i.e. businessmen.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.800
Yes, absolutely.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.100
Okay, I got it,
I'll make sure.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.600
Sir, I wish you a good 
day. Welcome to Atlas Jet.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.300
Good evening ladies and
gentlemen...

19:45.800 --> 19:49.300
Welcome on board for
flying to the Atlas Jet.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.700
- Your field of business?
- Textiles.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.100
- Very good. Yours?
- Tourism, mate.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.800
- Fine, and yours?
- The food sector.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.800
- Food sector! And you?
- I'm with textiles.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.900
It is said that the two who love textiles
are destined to meet.[Laughs] And you?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.400
- Yes?
- Your job, your occupation?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.000
Why are you asking?

20:09.200 --> 20:13.000
I need to be sure that our passengers
in Business Class are actually businessmen.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.400
I'm a film producer.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.900
Looking at madam here, I can more or less
guess the subject of your films...

20:20.100 --> 20:22.400
Congrats, you are in the right area!

20:23.200 --> 20:23.600
Well, what about you?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.500
Take them off, take them off!
What's your job?

20:28.700 --> 20:30.600
What occupation, I'm just having fun!

20:31.000 --> 20:32.300
Fun? I swear, I'll beat the fuck out of you!

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
Get in the back! Rude kid.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.800
You're just a slacker. Some kind of
Kargo Koray fan. Get in the back!

20:37.000 --> 20:38.800
Taking up Business Class seats!

20:39.900 --> 20:43.000
Excuse me. We are having
a small seurity issue.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.800
Don't worry Mr. And Mrs. Brown
there is a little problem.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.100
What's your occupation?

20:51.400 --> 20:56.300
Your seatbelts attach
as shown.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.400
Look at the belt it opens
and closes like this.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.400
Look at the belt it opens
and closes like this

21:03.800 --> 21:06.200
It's very easy, no need to explain
over and over.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.000
Our plane has eight emergency exits.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.000
The exits! Everyone turn your heads!

21:11.200 --> 21:13.700
Afterwards I don't want to hear anyone saying
I didn't see, I didn't know.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.400
Here, observe, 2 at the front,
2 behind and 2 right here.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.900
Ah! The emergency instructions.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.400
Don't bother with this at all.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.000
When they tell you to lean forward and
all that, they're chatting shit.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.900
If the plane crashes, everyone
just hug one another.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.000
The probability that we'll all die
is exactly ninety percent.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.700
You have viewing lights above each seat,
don't dare ask me later...

21:35.900 --> 21:38.700
...we're in the dark sir,
call the host for help.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.100
We're showing you,
lights above everyone.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.000
If the cabin pressure should vary,
above your head...

21:43.200 --> 21:46.500
Ah, oxygen! While we are
in the air, if the pressure drops...

21:46.700 --> 21:48.100
...the lid should open,
Where is the compartment?

21:48.300 --> 21:50.200
This is it.
It should open by itself.

21:50.400 --> 21:55.200
Take this, pull back the elastic,
then pull over your head like so.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.300
Make sure you do the kids first. They're
telling it wrong over there.

21:57.300 --> 22:01.300
Make sure you do the kids first. They're
telling it wrong over there. 

22:02.200 --> 22:05.000
Life jackets are below
the seats, you can set them to your size. 

22:05.200 --> 22:08.600
These are the clips, just clip on them like this. 

22:08.800 --> 22:12.200
Two red handles,
ensure you fasten them tight! 

22:12.900 --> 22:16.200
Hey! hey! Fuck! Get it off!

22:28.700 --> 22:30.300
Don't tear my hair off!

22:37.300 --> 22:39.400
I was going to die there you know, why don't you believe me? 

22:39.600 --> 22:41.900
My head aches due to increased blood pressure,
and my bottom due to diarrhoea, man. 

22:42.100 --> 22:44.100
And on top of all that the air pressure!
I swear I was going to explode. 

22:44.300 --> 22:45.600
But why did you pull
the strings Recep? 

22:45.800 --> 22:47.300
"Why did you pull
the strings Recep?" she says. 

22:47.500 --> 22:49.600
How else are we meant
to show the passengers? 

22:49.800 --> 22:53.000
Man I'm lucky to be alive.
 You see I have two capillaries... 

22:53.200 --> 22:56.800
...going from my neck to my brain, both
feeding my frontal lobe... 

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
When the circulation 
 disappears, I just collapse immediately! 

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
When the circulation 
 disappears, I just immediately collapse! 

23:03.600 --> 23:05.200
Yes, you've been through a lot. 

23:05.400 --> 23:06.500
Yes, I know. 

23:06.800 --> 23:08.400
You have not attached your belt? 

23:08.600 --> 23:10.200
Don't insult me. 

23:10.400 --> 23:12.000
Don't insult me. 

23:12.400 --> 23:16.400
My family is one of the first
Families of Aviation. 

23:16.700 --> 23:20.100
When I was only seven years old,
I was already playing with a force 12-14 G. 

23:20.400 --> 23:23.900
I'm very experienced.
Do you know who you're talking about? 

23:24.800 --> 23:27.900
My grandmother was one of the
first Turkish women who flew. 

23:28.100 --> 23:30.000
She was on a flight with
Safiye Soyman once. 

23:30.200 --> 23:31.800
Safiye Soyman?
Who is that? 

23:33.000 --> 23:36.100
What a disgrace! You don't know that and
call yourself a flight attendant? 

23:36.300 --> 23:38.200
How can you call yourself an air hostess? 

23:38.400 --> 23:40.100
You don't even know the first
Turkish woman who flew on a plane? 

23:40.300 --> 23:42.200
My goodness!There was even
an airport named after her. 

23:42.400 --> 23:43.900
You haven't heard of the Safiye Soyman airport? 

23:44.100 --> 23:47.400
But that's the Sabiha Gökçen airport, Recep,
not Safiye Soyman! 

23:48.400 --> 23:52.700
Oh yes, it's possibly a misnomer.
 My memory is overloaded. 

23:53.100 --> 23:54.400
You are funny. 

23:55.400 --> 23:56.600
Ay! What was that? 

24:00.900 --> 24:02.700
Dear passengers... 

24:02.900 --> 24:04.800
We are experiencing some turbulence. 

24:05.000 --> 24:06.600
Please fasten your seatbelts ... 

24:06.800 --> 24:07.900
-What's the hell is going on!
-It's just turbulence. 

24:08.300 --> 24:10.200
Hold on, I'll ask
the Captain. 

24:10.700 --> 24:12.000
It must be the pilot's
fault. 

24:12.200 --> 24:13.900
He needs to fly the plane
instead of talking. 

24:14.100 --> 24:15.400
Stay here, one minute. 

24:15.900 --> 24:17.400
Open up, I want a word! 

24:17.900 --> 24:20.300
Oy, come on out! Out! 

24:21.100 --> 24:22.300
Nothing is wrong sir, please be calm. 

24:22.500 --> 24:26.500
Come here.
What's with the artistic impressions? 

24:26.700 --> 24:28.600
Wake up,
You're lost in the head. 

24:28.800 --> 24:32.400
Pilot the aircraft properly!
Do not put it into turbulence. 

24:32.600 --> 24:34.900
Leave out the artistic stunts and fly the plane properly! 

24:35.100 --> 24:36.600
You are on an empty road. 

24:36.800 --> 24:38.300
-There's nothing in front!
-Nothing, nothing, nothing! 

24:38.500 --> 24:40.600
Look at you! Can't even brush your hair! 

24:40.800 --> 24:42.800
You think you're an expert?
You think you're the best? 

24:43.000 --> 24:44.500
Just shut up and drive the plane. 

24:44.700 --> 24:48.700
Pilot it properly!
You're up in empty space. 

24:49.100 --> 24:50.900
No roads, nothing,
just air all around! 

24:51.100 --> 24:53.800
Dumb fuck! 

24:54.700 --> 24:56.000
Let's see that. 

24:57.400 --> 24:59.900
Hmm, they should also give us men
hats like yours. 

25:00.900 --> 25:02.600
What happened?
What is it my handsome grandson? 

25:02.800 --> 25:04.600
Massage it, gently, gently... 

25:06.000 --> 25:08.500
But what happened to you grandson?
Tell me what you have. 

25:08.700 --> 25:12.300
It was the atmospheric pressure.
I've got gas in my stomach. 

25:12.500 --> 25:15.000
It happens to men
who are working. 

25:15.200 --> 25:18.600
Man, I had to submit my resignation
because of these difficulties. 

25:19.300 --> 25:20.600
What? What did you say...? 

25:20.800 --> 25:21.800
Yes, what else could I do? 

25:22.000 --> 25:24.100
But how many resignations, you bastard? 

25:24.300 --> 25:27.000
It's impossible to resign
17 times in 20 days! 

25:27.200 --> 25:28.200
But what am I to
do grandma? 

25:28.400 --> 25:31.100
The sector just doesn't suit me.
The Business Life is not for me. 

25:31.300 --> 25:33.700
Look at your Grandfather there! He established
an advertising agency. 

25:34.000 --> 25:36.600
The son of your uncle is now
in charge of its operations. He is very rich. 

25:36.800 --> 25:38.300
You can go there, I've spoken with Hakan. 

25:38.500 --> 25:39.700
Why? What did you say to him? 

25:39.900 --> 25:41.900
I spoke with him.
He's going to give you a share. 

25:42.100 --> 25:45.300
What?
But you've got no official evidence to prove that I have a share! 

25:45.500 --> 25:48.100
We live in a secular,
democratic country. 

25:48.300 --> 25:50.000
I didn't ask- did you have the right to? Is that fair? 

25:50.200 --> 25:52.600
You'll be the owner,
the partner of the company. 

25:52.800 --> 25:54.500
They're waiting for you there. Go now. 

25:54.700 --> 25:56.400
But grandma..
please don't send me there. 

25:56.600 --> 25:57.800
-Go!
-Please don't send me to Hakan! 

25:58.000 --> 25:59.600
-Go!
- Please! 

25:59.800 --> 26:01.100
That does it. I've had it up to here! 

26:01.300 --> 26:03.600
Just give me the damned address.
For fuck's sake, this will never end. 

26:03.800 --> 26:06.800
The way you keep nagging me, you sound
like a Japanese torturer. 

26:07.000 --> 26:08.700
At least go and see. If I can't make a man
out of you, I'll die unhappy... 

26:08.900 --> 26:10.000
Just give me the address. 

26:10.200 --> 26:12.700
Alright. I'll give it to you
 and then you can leave. 

26:12.900 --> 26:14.200
Give me the exact address then. 

26:14.400 --> 26:16.200
-Ok. Write it down.
-It's... 

26:17.100 --> 26:18.400
You've forgotten it, haven't you? 

26:18.600 --> 26:20.700
How are you supposed to find me
a job with your little brain? 

26:20.900 --> 26:23.600
I'm not finding you a job.
I'm just telling to you to get your share of the company. 

26:23.800 --> 26:25.100
I really don't want to
go to that knob Hakan. 

26:25.300 --> 26:27.800
What? No my boy, you must.
If you don't, I'll never forgive you. 

26:56.200 --> 26:58.200
Peace be with you.
Is Hakan the slimy bastard here? 

26:58.700 --> 26:59.800
Hakan the what...? 

27:00.000 --> 27:01.300
Hakan Ivedik. My cousin. 

27:01.500 --> 27:02.900
Mr. Hakan
is in a meeting. 

27:03.100 --> 27:04.600
Where exactly can I find
this meeting room? 

27:04.800 --> 27:06.200
Thanks.
I'll find it myself. 

27:06.400 --> 27:08.600
Do you have an appointment?
Sir, one second please... 

27:08.900 --> 27:11.300
My friends,the Japanese are world leaders
in the automobile sector.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.300
If we get this new contract finalised, we will
be the representatives for the Middle East.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.000
You must realise, this is of utmost importance.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.600
The launch date has been finalised,
the cost reports need drawing up. 

27:18.800 --> 27:23.800
Heeey! How are you doing,
you wild animal? 

27:24.000 --> 27:25.300
So you're a boss now?
A boss, eh? 

27:25.500 --> 27:28.400
You've grown up,
and now you make big meetings? 

27:28.600 --> 27:30.000
What a big man.
What a big man. 

27:30.300 --> 27:33.000
Excuse us friends,
I'm interrupting your meeting... 

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
...but he is my cousin. 

27:35.200 --> 27:36.800
We both grew up together
from childhood. 

27:37.000 --> 27:39.800
One day he says to me, brother Recep,
I don't feel good... 

27:40.000 --> 27:42.500
...he tells me: I am at the age of 18,
but I haven't yet fucked. 

27:43.800 --> 27:45.000
Come into my room, Recep. 

27:45.200 --> 27:47.700
Then he says,
Wait, wait, listen... 

27:47.900 --> 27:48.900
...I'll speak a little less crudely
as there are some girls here. 

27:49.200 --> 27:51.400
A few years later, he calls me again, 'My brother,
Now I am 22...' he says. 

27:51.600 --> 27:54.900
...and all I've been doing are hand-exercises,
I'm really on fire! 

27:55.100 --> 27:57.900
So I told him, alright my son
I'm going to take you to school. 

27:58.100 --> 28:01.100
I say school, but you understand,
I'm talking about a brothel. 

28:01.300 --> 28:04.000
So I take him to Karaköy
and put him into one of the rooms... 

28:04.200 --> 28:06.100
I was waiting for him outside the door,
understand? 

28:06.300 --> 28:08.600
While I was there,
I heard a voice calling from inside. 

28:09.300 --> 28:11.200
'Recep, come into my room'. 

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Me, I thought it was the voice of the girl,
you know that was 'handling' him, but no! 

28:16.100 --> 28:18.700
[Laughs crazily] 

28:19.700 --> 28:21.600
- But what is this?
- We are in a meeting. 

28:21.800 --> 28:24.900
What, you couldn't do it? Haha!
Your little mushroom locust not up to it? 

28:25.100 --> 28:26.700
My dear Recep,
come to my office. 

28:26.900 --> 28:28.300
You have an office? 

28:28.500 --> 28:30.700
You've become a boss,
now you have an office? 

28:30.900 --> 28:31.800
You guys carry on without me. 

28:47.600 --> 28:49.700
Ah Recep, how many
years has it been? 

28:49.900 --> 28:51.200
Probably 10-15 years. 

28:51.400 --> 28:53.700
No way? Yes, it's flown by. 

28:54.800 --> 28:58.500
Alright, alright, stop with the small talk,
let's talk business. 

28:58.700 --> 29:00.700
Now my dear Hakan,
I believe that my grandmother called you. 

29:00.900 --> 29:02.200
No, she didn't call me. 

29:02.400 --> 29:04.200
- She didn't call?
- God no. 

29:06.700 --> 29:08.600
Alright, I'll explain my dire situation. 

29:08.800 --> 29:11.600
I have decided to return
to the field of commerce. 

29:11.800 --> 29:13.200
With the 'encouragement'
of my grandma. 

29:13.400 --> 29:16.000
I tried my luck,
in different sectors. 

29:16.200 --> 29:18.700
I tried the tourism sector, the field of medicine. 

29:18.900 --> 29:22.300
Aviation sector, food sector,
and others even... 

29:22.500 --> 29:25.800
...but you know the state of our country. 

29:26.000 --> 29:26.500
Everyone sticks to one field,
they have training for that... 

29:26.500 --> 29:30.500
Everyone sticks to one field,
they have training for that...

29:30.700 --> 29:34.200
...but you'll see 17-18 million
young, hungry, unemployed people. 

29:34.400 --> 29:35.700
...At the moment, I'm one of them. 

29:35.900 --> 29:39.200
It's true that the market is difficult.
The real sector doesn't want to accept you. 

29:39.400 --> 29:41.000
It's not enough. 

29:41.200 --> 29:44.100
That's true. Commerce is very difficult.
We are also in a fight. 

29:44.300 --> 29:48.900
Difficult. Very difficult.
I've made such an effort. 

29:49.300 --> 29:51.800
Thing is, you need to know
someone popular, someone powerful.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.800
Thing is, you need to know
someone popular, someone powerful. 

29:56.200 --> 29:57.700
You understand me? 

29:58.100 --> 29:58.400
So I've been saying to myself, we have
such a robust company thanks to our grandfather... 

29:58.400 --> 30:02.400
So I've been saying to myself, we have
such a robust company thanks to our grandfather...

30:02.600 --> 30:03.000
...Alaaddin Company; which our forefathers
have now bequeathed us... 

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
...Alaaddin Company; which our forefathers
have now bequeathed us...

30:07.200 --> 30:10.600
...they left it to their grandsons,
and here we are. 

30:10.800 --> 30:13.500
It's now time for us to step up,
it's time for us to run this company. 

30:13.800 --> 30:17.400
So I thought to myself I should discuss this
with Hakan, we can reach an arrangement. 

30:17.600 --> 30:21.600
...if we combine my intelligence
with your drive, make a partnership... 

30:21.900 --> 30:23.600
But Recep, what partnership? 

30:24.000 --> 30:26.600
These affairs are very difficult. The publicity
sector is very different. 

30:26.800 --> 30:29.900
Listen to me, boss.
I've been speaking to you gently, have I not? 

30:30.400 --> 30:34.200
I tell you that I also have a right
over our grandfather's company. 

30:34.800 --> 30:37.400
You are his grandson. And so am I. 

30:37.600 --> 30:39.800
Therefore a partnership
is mandatory. 

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Look, business is not for you.
Me, I've studied for this at university. 

30:43.200 --> 30:46.000
Don't make me mad!

30:46.200 --> 30:46.900
Stuff your university up you're ass!
I have a right over this company. 

30:46.900 --> 30:50.900
I said nothing about school!
I have a right over this company.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.200
I swear I'll draw a line right here
and take my rightful half! 

30:54.800 --> 30:56.600
How dare you not allow me
into my own company? 

30:56.800 --> 31:00.300
I swear I'll file a case against you.
And I'll break your jaw before I go. 

31:01.300 --> 31:02.700
But my brother, why are you talking like this? 

31:03.000 --> 31:05.200
[Shouts in rage]. Shut it! 

31:06.800 --> 31:08.400
Don't make me lose it! 

31:08.600 --> 31:11.500
Alright alright, my dear brother. Stay calm.
What do you want to do here? 

31:11.700 --> 31:15.400
What do I want do here?
What do you think, huh? What do you do? 

31:15.600 --> 31:16.700
I'm the boss. 

31:16.900 --> 31:19.100
Yes, you are the boss. Therefore
me, I'm the vice-boss. 

31:19.500 --> 31:23.500
Is that understood?
Say it now- I am the vice boss. 

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
Say it to me now!
Tell me that I'm the vice-boss!

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Come on then, say it.
Say I'm the second in command. Tell me. 

31:30.200 --> 31:31.600
You are the demi-boss. 

31:31.800 --> 31:33.200
Say it again- I am the vice president. 

31:33.400 --> 31:36.000
- You are the VP.
- Ah, now we see eye-to-eye, eh?

31:37.000 --> 31:38.900
Alright, so what will you want,
you know as salary? 

31:39.300 --> 31:41.900
Well of course, for now,
professionally speaking... 

31:42.100 --> 31:45.700
...money is not a priority,
but since we're talking money anyway.. 

31:46.000 --> 31:49.600
You know that these days, the average wage for
a man... 

31:49.800 --> 31:51.200
...with a family of 4
is around 800-900 YTL... 

31:51.400 --> 31:53.900
...so since I'm a family of one... 

31:54.300 --> 31:57.400
...I'll have 200 YTL plus tax plus
expenses, and mind, I want full expenses. 

31:57.600 --> 32:01.000
I'm going to be using the Metrobus
as well as other methods of transport. 

32:02.000 --> 32:06.400
Fine. That's agreed.
I must return to the meeting. 

32:06.800 --> 32:10.800
Hey sit back down, idiot. You
can't go back yet. 

32:11.500 --> 32:15.000
Aren't you going to introduce me in my
new position to the rest of the company? 

32:25.800 --> 32:28.000
My friends. Everyone pay attention. 

32:28.500 --> 32:32.300
Come, all of you leave your work for a moment.
Mr Recep here is my new partner. 

32:32.500 --> 32:34.600
He will be joining us as of today. 

32:35.100 --> 32:37.100
We were here from the birth of this company!
When no one else was! 

32:37.300 --> 32:37.900
No one was here!
Only us! Only us! 

32:37.900 --> 32:41.900
No one was here!
Only us! Only us!

32:42.100 --> 32:44.400
Our grandfather founded
this company. 

32:44.600 --> 32:47.100
He founded it with
only a cart and some land. 

32:47.100 --> 32:51.100
He founded it with
only a cart and some land! 

32:54.000 --> 32:56.100
But Recep, why are
you shouting at them? 

32:56.300 --> 32:59.400
I'm a bit nervous, as this
is my first day as boss. 

33:00.000 --> 33:03.400
Excuse me Mr Hakan, but what
will be Mr Recep's position? 

33:03.600 --> 33:08.000
Heyyy look here, Clark Kent,
I'll be here in the missionary position, ok? 

33:09.000 --> 33:11.800
We haven't finalised that yet,
don't worry it'll be sorted later. 

33:12.000 --> 33:14.200
Hakan, you said nothing
about my position... 

33:14.400 --> 33:16.600
...as vice-boss! 

33:18.200 --> 33:21.000
My friends, Mr Recep is
the vice boss. 

33:21.200 --> 33:23.900
He is my equal here.
That will suffice for now. 

33:24.600 --> 33:27.000
My brother, I must return to the meeting. 

33:27.200 --> 33:30.100
Go! The company needs you!
Go my brave boy! Don't come back...

33:30.300 --> 33:31.300
without achieving your task! 

33:44.400 --> 33:48.400
My friends. In my first minute here,
I have observed... 

33:48.800 --> 33:50.200
...certain mental disorders. 

33:50.800 --> 33:53.300
Now, I'm going to sort
these out. 

33:53.500 --> 33:56.800
I'll be back later.
Now I must go and deal with the flow of business. 

33:57.500 --> 33:59.000
Good job. 

34:12.000 --> 34:14.100
Ugh. They understand nothing about art. 

34:14.300 --> 34:16.900
One must have the right point of view with art. 

34:21.900 --> 34:23.500
Hey ladies,
will you watch this? 

34:24.300 --> 34:26.500
It's quite clear that there is... 

34:26.699 --> 34:28.199
...motionblur in
the televisons behind you. 

34:28.800 --> 34:30.699
Yes, there is motionblur. 

34:30.900 --> 34:32.900
Pay attention to everything,
please. 

34:33.199 --> 34:35.000
Girls, the working life is tough. 

34:35.199 --> 34:37.400
You might be physically as
strong as a horse... 

34:37.600 --> 34:39.800
But you must also
be active, dynamic. 

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Mad, insubordinate, and solitary. 

34:42.900 --> 34:46.900
That's why on these sensory
sensitive televisions... 

34:47.199 --> 34:48.400
...the TJK TV horse-racing channel will always be on.
Here, and in the whole building. 

34:48.400 --> 34:52.400
...the TJK TV horse-racing channel will always be on.
Here, and in the whole building.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.100
You understand me? Ding!! 

34:57.400 --> 35:00.100
The competition has commenced,
dear viewers, I can see. 

35:00.400 --> 35:01.800
Yes sir. 

35:02.000 --> 35:04.800
The principle is to remain very strong and firm.
Like a horse. 

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Strong. 

35:11.200 --> 35:14.400
You understand? 

35:14.600 --> 35:16.800
So go forth, with dynamism, energy,
dynamism, energy, dynamism. 

35:17.000 --> 35:19.200
Hop dynamic, hip hop... 

35:22.300 --> 35:23.600
That's how. 

35:29.200 --> 35:32.600
Hey you, those in the office,
I've got my eye on you. 

35:32.800 --> 35:35.200
I will inspect that when I return.
What the hell is that, girl? 

35:35.400 --> 35:39.100
Don't hang your personal
clothes here please. 

35:39.400 --> 35:42.100
Go wash this at home,
not here. 

35:42.300 --> 35:44.600
And you, take all those of your arm. 

35:44.800 --> 35:46.800
Why on earth are you wearing nuts? 

35:47.000 --> 35:48.800
Why are you walking around
with nuts on your wrist? 

35:49.000 --> 35:51.600
Don't you dare respond to me again,
or I'll give you a slap. 

35:51.800 --> 35:54.300
He asks me "which position".
Impudent swine. Work properly. 

35:54.500 --> 35:54.800
Hang up the phone. Hang up!
We need to make some spending cuts. 

35:54.800 --> 35:58.800
Hang up the phone. Hang up!
We need to make some spending cuts.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Before Hakan, the water mill here
was always flowing, always flowing. 

36:03.700 --> 36:05.000
But no!! 

36:05.200 --> 36:08.400
This is my Grandfather's company.
And there is an economic crisis. 

36:08.600 --> 36:10.900
You, do you use
Photoshop? 

36:11.100 --> 36:13.000
- Yes.
- Is it version 4 or 5? 

36:13.200 --> 36:14.700
- Version 4.
- Well done my daughter.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.600
Work the Layer layer, right my child? 

36:16.800 --> 36:20.000
Very good, fatty,
using the Photoshop. Good. 

36:20.200 --> 36:22.700
I appreciate your working together on this.
Good partnership. 

36:22.900 --> 36:25.800
But you, are you one of
those pirates of the Caribbean? 

36:26.000 --> 36:27.500
You think you're a pirate of the Caribbean? 

36:27.700 --> 36:29.900
Go cut your hair, or I'll
throw you out. 

36:30.100 --> 36:32.100
Go sort yourself out!
Go cut and comb your hair. 

36:33.800 --> 36:37.200
My dear, my daughter.
How old are you, child? 

36:37.400 --> 36:38.300
27. 

36:38.500 --> 36:40.700
Very good, little one. What
do you want to be when you grow up? 

36:40.900 --> 36:41.700
But I'm... 

36:41.900 --> 36:44.000
Ah, look at my little darling.
She is so small. 

36:44.200 --> 36:46.900
Next year come with your fancy costume
on the 23rd April, to the children's party. 

36:47.100 --> 36:49.100
You can wear the
Norwegian national dress. 

36:49.300 --> 36:52.800
We'll even let you be
in charge for a whole day. 

36:54.800 --> 36:58.800
Oy! Go! Get away from here. 

36:59.700 --> 37:02.500
You pervert, sexually harassing the girls! 

37:02.800 --> 37:05.100
Yes, bravo young girl.
What is this? 

37:05.600 --> 37:07.700
Tell me, what is this my dear? 

37:08.900 --> 37:12.300
It's a mobile phone? Don't you know
not to keep it so close to the computer! 

37:12.500 --> 37:14.900
You're working with equipment
worth millions of dollars. 

37:15.100 --> 37:18.000
It might damage the EBS, ESR,
and ASR of the machines. 

37:18.500 --> 37:21.800
We tell you at every opportunity.
You still haven't understood? 

37:22.300 --> 37:25.300
Look at that! Two employees at one table. 

37:25.500 --> 37:28.700
Get lost! Go and find
another table. 

37:29.000 --> 37:30.900
Take your notebook as well. 

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
There, there, darling, it was a necessary action
to boost your performance. 

37:35.200 --> 37:38.000
Good. Carry on.
Work hard. Good job. 

37:38.200 --> 37:40.800
Good, I appreciate your
use of colour. Very good. 

37:46.400 --> 37:49.600
So as soon as I found the place,
I went and got hold of him. 

37:49.800 --> 37:50.200
I said to him, "Hakan,you can't
manage everything by yourself... 

37:50.200 --> 37:54.200
I said to him, "Hakan,you can't
manage everything by yourself...

37:54.400 --> 37:55.900
...at this company
founded by my Grandfather". 

37:56.100 --> 37:58.200
He immediately saw the sense in what I said. 

37:58.400 --> 38:02.400
He told me, of course, my dear Recep.
You should become half-owner. 

38:02.700 --> 38:06.500
He is a man of good faith,
reasonable, but too talkative and unscrupulous. 

38:06.700 --> 38:08.600
So now you have a job,
you need to find a girl. 

38:09.000 --> 38:12.100
- Grandma, if you don't shut up I'll beat the shit out of you.
- Be decent! 

38:12.300 --> 38:14.500
I'm not trying to be rude, but I've
had enough trouble just getting a job. 

38:14.700 --> 38:16.400
- Go find a girl right away!
- Come on! 

38:16.600 --> 38:19.300
- You'll find one and show her to me.
- Dammit, haven't you done enough? 

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
I want to see a girl. 

38:20.700 --> 38:23.400
Just carry on spinning wool,
why are you talking to me about girls? 

38:23.600 --> 38:25.800
You will find one immediately!
Don't try to shout louder than me. 

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
[mimics] You will find one immediately!
Don't try to shout louder than me. 

38:28.200 --> 38:31.100
-That's enough! You're such a disgrace! Poh, poh!
- [mimics]Poh, poh!! 

38:31.300 --> 38:35.900
Look at this rude,
dishonest, impudent lecher! 

38:47.600 --> 38:49.900
Where is everyone? 

38:50.400 --> 38:54.100
Its not even 12.30, and everyone's
packed up for the day. 

38:54.900 --> 38:58.900
Where are the people?
The machines are still on. 

38:59.100 --> 39:01.800
These devices are consuming
electricity. 

39:02.000 --> 39:04.700
This is the company of my Grandfather,
my Grandfather! 

39:18.500 --> 39:20.800
Well done my boy.
Bravo to you. 

39:21.000 --> 39:24.400
I congratulate you.
Good boy. Good boy. 

39:24.600 --> 39:27.900
Where are the workers? You are the only one here?
Well done. 

39:28.100 --> 39:29.700
It's 12.30 Mr Recep,
it's lunch break now. 

39:29.900 --> 39:32.200
So why haven't you gone with them,
aren't they your friends? 

39:32.400 --> 39:34.700
- No, I don't like them.
- But why ever not? 

39:34.900 --> 39:36.200
They're all imbeciles. 

39:36.400 --> 39:39.300
Well that's true. Especially the group
in the middle, they are real stupids. 

39:39.500 --> 39:42.400
Idiots. So you don't have many
friends here... 

39:42.600 --> 39:43.300
No, not many. 

39:44.100 --> 39:46.800
- Not many female friends either?
- Oh no, I have plenty of girlfriends. 

39:47.200 --> 39:49.500
What? What do you mean plenty, you ugly monkey? 

39:49.900 --> 39:51.800
They're on the internet. 

39:52.100 --> 39:56.100
They say there are many girls
on the internet, is it true? 

39:56.300 --> 39:57.600
It's very true Mr Recep sir. 

39:57.800 --> 39:59.900
I need around 1 or 2 girls. 

40:00.100 --> 40:04.400
I finally managed to get a job.
Now I'm at the second phase, to get married. 

40:04.600 --> 40:07.900
You can easily find them. There are escort agency
sites, dating sites. 

40:08.100 --> 40:10.200
What! Shut it before I...!! 

40:11.000 --> 40:14.800
I tell you I'm looking for a girl
to marry, and you talk about escorts. 

40:15.200 --> 40:16.000
It's impossible! 

40:16.200 --> 40:18.500
- Excuse me Mr Recep sir
- How dare you call your future sister-in-law an escort! 

40:18.700 --> 40:21.400
Ok, ok. So you want to make a profile
on normal sites. 

40:21.600 --> 40:24.300
Go and make me a profile. 

40:24.500 --> 40:26.700
Save me from this life. 

40:27.000 --> 40:30.600
Here we go then. First, you
need to make a nickname. 

40:30.800 --> 40:34.300
- Nick what?
- Nickname. A pseudonym. 

40:34.600 --> 40:36.500
- Ah, a pseudonym.
- Do you have one? 

40:36.700 --> 40:39.200
Me and my grandfather share the
same nickname: "Bear-strangler". 

40:39.500 --> 40:41.300
"Bear-strangler", isn't that
a bit harsh on yourself? 

40:41.500 --> 40:43.600
How dare you speak like that
about the name of my grandfather! 

40:43.800 --> 40:45.700
A girl must accept me
just the way I am. 

40:45.900 --> 40:48.800
The babes are attracted by
my swagger,not my display. 

40:49.000 --> 40:51.800
The girl will see that I'm
a Bear-strangler when she sees me anyway. 

40:52.100 --> 40:54.000
Ok. Now I have to put
in your hobbies. 

40:54.200 --> 40:56.400
My hobbies? 

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
Put down sport. 

40:57.800 --> 41:00.100
- At sports, I like horse racing.
- Horse racing. 

41:00.300 --> 41:02.200
- Yes
- Any others? 

41:02.700 --> 41:06.000
- Close-quarters combat. I can knock people out.
I do it well. 

41:06.200 --> 41:07.700
If I hit someone, they just drop immediately. 

41:07.900 --> 41:11.900
Ok, so he fights well.
Are there any others? 

41:12.300 --> 41:16.000
- I am sensitive.
- He is sensitive. 

41:16.200 --> 41:17.800
I am aggressive. I have complexes. 

41:18.000 --> 41:20.900
But I am timid as a kitten
when by myself. 

41:21.100 --> 41:22.300
Aggressive, complexes,
like a kitten when by self. 

41:22.300 --> 41:26.300
Aggressive, complexes,
like a kitten when by self.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.100
- Yes.
- Fine. 

41:28.300 --> 41:32.000
And finally, we need
a profile photo. 

41:32.200 --> 41:33.900
- Fine, take one now.
- Ok, I'll take one. 

41:35.700 --> 41:37.300
Smile Mr Recep. 

41:37.500 --> 41:41.300
- Count me down from 3 to 1.
- 3, 2, 1. 

41:42.100 --> 41:44.000
- It's ok.
- Is it ok? 

41:44.200 --> 41:45.300
- Yes, take a look.
- Fine. 

41:45.900 --> 41:49.200
- I'll completet your profile this evening at home.
- See if any chicks have replied yet. 

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
- I can't, not yet.
- Why not? 

41:51.600 --> 41:53.200
No one would respond
that quickly. 

41:53.400 --> 41:55.900
Look, I'll complete it at home.
Tomorrow you'll have two, for sure. 

41:56.100 --> 41:58.800
Yes ok then. Fine,
we'll see tomorrow. 

41:59.000 --> 42:00.200
Tomorrow. 

42:00.400 --> 42:02.700
Ok, now you can call me brother
Recep instead of Mr sir Recep. 

42:02.900 --> 42:05.300
- Now we're on a level.
- Ok then, brother Recep... 

42:05.500 --> 42:07.700
Hey, I'll break
your arms and your head. 

42:08.500 --> 42:11.200
- Didn't you hear? I do close-quarters combat.
- Forgive me, brother Recep. 

42:32.500 --> 42:36.100
Brother Recep. Oh brother Recep... 

42:37.800 --> 42:38.500
Huh? 

42:38.700 --> 42:40.100
What are you doing?
Is this a camera? 

42:40.300 --> 42:42.400
Hey, don't come here to chat shit,
can you not see I am busy? I am photocopying. 

42:42.600 --> 42:44.800
- I have some good news.
- What's happened? 

42:45.000 --> 42:47.300
- I've got you a date.
- Really? 

42:47.600 --> 42:49.200
- I swear.
- By God? 

42:49.400 --> 42:53.400
- By God.
- Oh my God. I am very happy. 

42:53.700 --> 42:56.600
I'm very excited.
I swear to you, I am so excited! 

42:56.800 --> 42:59.400
By God! By God!. 

43:00.000 --> 43:02.600
I told you I'd manage to get one.
Well done. 

43:02.800 --> 43:03.900
Lay it here!! 

43:04.900 --> 43:08.400
This is super. I need to go
put myself in order. 

43:08.600 --> 43:11.300
But first let's photograph
this moment to remember. 

43:11.500 --> 43:13.100
- Ow, what are you doing
- Take that. 

43:13.300 --> 43:14.600
- But you've broken it.
- Come, come. 

43:14.800 --> 43:15.700
But there is
dangerous radiation... 

43:22.600 --> 43:24.800
What are you doing brother Recep?
People will mistake us for lovers. 

43:25.000 --> 43:27.400
I'm not doing this
for your amusement. 

43:27.600 --> 43:30.000
In fact, all my friends
are animal-types. 

43:30.200 --> 43:32.900
This is the first time
that I've dated someone through the internet. 

43:33.100 --> 43:34.800
It's nothing to get so excited about.
It will be so good. 

43:35.000 --> 43:37.700
The girl's nickname is 'daisygirl'.
Her clothes are pink. 

43:37.900 --> 43:40.800
- Let me see if she's arrived.
Has she arrived? 

43:41.000 --> 43:44.600
- No, stay calm.
- I just had an explosion of adrenaline. 

43:44.800 --> 43:48.000
Look at my mouth and my tongue
are so dry. Look, can you see? 

43:48.200 --> 43:50.400
I'm going to get something
to drink. You want anything? 

43:50.600 --> 43:51.800
- No thanks.
- Fine, mate. 

43:55.900 --> 43:57.400
- Thank you.
- Pardon. 

43:57.800 --> 44:00.900
Good day.
Can you give me an Orangina? 

44:01.200 --> 44:04.400
- I'm sorry, we don't have any orangina.
- Alright, give me a glass of lime. 

44:05.000 --> 44:08.400
- We don't have any of that, sorry.
- Then give me a cup of sage tea. 

44:08.900 --> 44:10.600
Sorry, we don't have
any sage tea. 

44:12.200 --> 44:14.600
Alright then, give me
one of those mint and lemon teas. Go on hurry up. 

44:14.800 --> 44:17.100
But sir, we don't do
mint and lemon tea here. 

44:17.300 --> 44:19.500
- Give me an orchid then.
- We have no orchids. 

44:19.900 --> 44:23.300
- Not even some boza?
- We only sell coffee. 

44:23.500 --> 44:25.700
Ok ok. Give me a Mýrra then. Hurry. 

44:26.200 --> 44:27.700
We don't have any
mýrra sir. 

44:27.900 --> 44:30.600
What, isn't this a Starbucks? 

44:31.600 --> 44:34.900
You don't have anything. The satisfaction of
the customer is very important. 

44:35.500 --> 44:38.900
You may choose from our menu
sir. 

44:39.100 --> 44:41.000
- That is all that we sell here.
- Let me see. 

44:43.000 --> 44:45.800
The menu is good.
It's a full menu. 

44:47.000 --> 44:50.400
What do you suggest?
I don't understand any of it. 

44:50.700 --> 44:51.600
Why not try a caramel macchiato.
I'll put in an extra espresso shot. 

44:51.600 --> 44:55.600
Why not try a caramel macchiato.
I'll put in an extra espresso shot.  

44:55.800 --> 44:59.400
Very well, fine.
Give me a Karamallimohnettu zopressoshotter. 

44:59.600 --> 45:02.600
- What a menu!
- Tall-grande-vinti. 

45:02.800 --> 45:05.400
What's that sir?
Those are 3 different sizes. 

45:05.600 --> 45:07.500
Tall-grenti-finti, that's all I want,
get on with it. 

45:07.700 --> 45:09.800
God, do I have to wait
till next morning? 

45:10.000 --> 45:10.600
Your name? 

45:11.500 --> 45:13.800
What, you need to verify
my ID? 

45:14.000 --> 45:16.500
No, not that. I need you to give
me your name... 

45:16.700 --> 45:20.200
...so that I can call you
when your order is ready. 

45:20.400 --> 45:24.400
I don't give my name
to people I don't know. 

45:24.800 --> 45:27.800
It's my rule. Write down
my pseudonym. "Bear-strangler". 

45:29.200 --> 45:33.200
Ok then, Mr
"Bear-strangler". 

45:34.100 --> 45:36.300
Yeah, write whatever
shit you want. 

45:36.500 --> 45:38.000
Excuse me,
could I have a serviette? 

45:38.200 --> 45:39.800
- Daisygirl?
- What? 

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
I am "Bear-strangler".
Daisygirl, right? 

45:43.200 --> 45:44.500
What daisy? What do you mean? 

45:44.700 --> 45:48.300
I am "Bear-strangler".
Pink clothes, we have a date. 

45:48.600 --> 45:50.800
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll strangle the bear like so. 

45:51.000 --> 45:53.400
You crazy or what?
You animal! Get lost! 

45:53.600 --> 45:55.600
God! Oh God! 

45:55.800 --> 45:58.200
God no! 

45:58.400 --> 45:59.800
Brother Recep? 

46:00.000 --> 46:03.400
I've lost an eye.
My eye! 

46:04.200 --> 46:06.200
My kidneys! 

46:06.400 --> 46:08.100
Oh God! 

46:08.800 --> 46:10.100
[shouts wildly] 

46:13.400 --> 46:15.500
You want me to blow into it? 

46:15.700 --> 46:20.000
My eye! I can't see!
Where am I? 

46:20.200 --> 46:22.600
Take me to the exit!
Take me to the exit. 

46:23.300 --> 46:25.500
Oh God! 

46:25.700 --> 46:27.000
[shouting] 

46:33.100 --> 46:36.900
Oh...She burned me Ali Kerem,
she ruined me Mehmet Ali! 

46:37.400 --> 46:39.900
You didn't help me out, you didn't
save me. Put some more on my eye. 

46:40.100 --> 46:41.000
Ok. 

46:41.700 --> 46:45.400
Oh God. That girl pepper-sprayed
me right in the eyes. 

46:45.600 --> 46:47.400
And you couldn't do anything...
Some more. 

46:47.600 --> 46:48.800
Ok. 

46:49.400 --> 46:55.500
She's blinded me.
She made me blind Mehmet Ali! 

46:55.700 --> 46:57.500
It's you who wanted the nickname. 

46:57.700 --> 47:00.200
But you should have told me you fool.
That nickname is a bit too awkward. 

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
It's you who's so good
with computers. 

47:02.600 --> 47:03.900
Alright,I'll tell
you what we'll do. 

47:04.100 --> 47:06.700
We'll make a new profile
and find a new nickname. 

47:07.200 --> 47:10.800
Do what you want.
They've blinded me. 

47:11.200 --> 47:13.100
Oh my eyes are burned, Mehmet Ali! 

47:13.300 --> 47:15.900
Is there a film that you like?
We could use the names of your heroes? 

47:16.100 --> 47:18.400
- There's a film I quite like, Karate Kid.
- Karate Kid, what's that got to do with anything? 

47:18.600 --> 47:21.500
But I like it a lot.
The way they do the moves. [imitates karate] 

47:21.700 --> 47:24.900
There's a guy in it, Miyagi-Sen.
Bzzzzzp, he catches a fly with his chopsticks. 

47:25.100 --> 47:27.000
- Alright then, Karate Kid.
- Write it in. 

47:27.200 --> 47:28.200
Karate Kid. 

47:28.400 --> 47:31.000
So we have to write things
from the Far East as your hobbies. 

47:31.200 --> 47:33.700
Good, write things related
to the Far East. 

47:33.900 --> 47:36.000
Yes, there are quite a few from
the Far East in my family. 

47:36.200 --> 47:38.100
- From the Far East?
- We were born in Kars. 

47:38.300 --> 47:39.500
But Kars isn't in the Far East! 

47:39.800 --> 47:43.400
What, is it in the Near West?
Shithead.

47:43.600 --> 47:43.900
Kars is in the Far East
of Turkey. 

47:43.900 --> 47:47.900
Kars is in the Far East
of Turkey.  

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
Do you want me to write
sushi as your favourite food? 

47:50.600 --> 47:51.800
Write it. Write whatever you want. 

47:52.300 --> 47:54.200
- This sushi stuff, does it taste good?
- Yes. It's a Japanese thing. 

47:54.400 --> 47:55.900
Good, write it in.
Write it if it's Japanese. 

47:59.200 --> 47:59.900
Ok. 

48:03.000 --> 48:06.500
I'm feeling a little better now.
Is the chick coming tonight? 

48:06.700 --> 48:08.600
Not this evening but
we'll definitely get one or two tomorrow. 

48:08.800 --> 48:11.000
Alright then. I'm counting on you. 

48:11.200 --> 48:14.000
If it turns out like the last time,
I'll rip your stupid hair out, do you hear? 

48:14.200 --> 48:18.200
I swear I'll straighten
you out. 

48:18.400 --> 48:20.100
- Understood.
- Take care. See you. 

48:24.400 --> 48:27.900
Ok girls. Let's have a look at
your fortunes from this cup. 

48:28.400 --> 48:31.600
There's a saying- you shouldn't trust a fortune teller
but you can't live without one. 

48:31.900 --> 48:35.100
Isn't that so, Elizabeth?
Oh I do love you. 

48:35.300 --> 48:36.300
- Make a wish.
- That's it. 

48:39.000 --> 48:40.400
Your wish will come true. 

48:44.700 --> 48:45.900
Look closely now,
I will tell you frankly what I see. 

48:46.100 --> 48:47.800
Don't get angry... 

48:49.000 --> 48:52.300
Someone has something that is swelling for you. 

48:53.400 --> 48:54.900
They've got a crush on you. 

48:55.100 --> 48:56.500
Keep an eye out for him. 

48:57.400 --> 49:00.000
Look at this cup,
see? 

49:00.200 --> 49:01.100
Yes, it speaks the truth. 

49:01.300 --> 49:02.500
Yes but you know, my boyfriend
Berkecan he doesn't understand me. 

49:02.500 --> 49:06.500
Yes but you know, my boyfriend
Berkecan he doesn't understand me.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.900
He never stops criticising me
and doesn't stay faithful. 

49:10.100 --> 49:11.600
I'm really down. 

49:11.800 --> 49:15.600
Ok, but why are you talking
like a sealion? 

49:17.800 --> 49:20.900
What is that?
Sort yourself out. 

49:21.100 --> 49:24.700
- Ok, who's next?
- Brother Recep, you have a message. 

49:24.900 --> 49:27.800
Didn't I tell you not to call me
Brother Recep in public! 

49:28.600 --> 49:30.900
You have to call me Mr Recep sir.
Say it. Mr Recep. 

49:31.100 --> 49:32.800
- Mr Recep.
- Go on, get lost. Go! 

49:33.400 --> 49:37.300
Get going.
Give me the cup, Clémentine. 

49:40.900 --> 49:43.800
Someone is inflating for you.
Yes, you as well. 

49:44.400 --> 49:47.300
I'm afraid it's the same
for both of you. Pay attention. 

49:47.500 --> 49:49.900
I'll explain it to you some other time.
I have a little rendezvous I need to catch. 

49:50.100 --> 49:51.400
I'll come back soon.
In a little while. 

49:51.600 --> 49:53.300
Don't go anywhere,
ok, Elizabeth? 

49:53.500 --> 49:55.300
I will return Clémentine. 

50:03.100 --> 50:05.600
Brother Recep. Brother Recep. 

50:06.400 --> 50:07.800
Hey Brother Recep! 

50:08.800 --> 50:11.000
Why the hell are you disturbing me... 

50:11.300 --> 50:13.200
...while I'm performing my respiratory exercises?
- What disturbing, you were sleeping. 

50:13.400 --> 50:15.700
I'm trying to stay calm. 

50:15.900 --> 50:17.800
I'm very nervous,
come with me inside. 

50:18.000 --> 50:20.100
What am I supposed to do,
pretend I'm your parent? 

50:20.300 --> 50:22.800
- Can you hold my hand?
- Hold your hand?. 

50:23.000 --> 50:25.600
- Yes please.
- But you'll look ridiculous in front of the girl. 

50:27.100 --> 50:31.100
Just go on, go inside now, be relaxed.
Go sit at table number 12. 

50:31.400 --> 50:34.200
Act like you come here every evening
and eat sushi regularly. 

50:34.400 --> 50:37.000
Understood. I'll try and stay calm. 

50:37.200 --> 50:40.300
I'll act as though I always sit
at table 12 and eat sushi. 

50:40.500 --> 50:41.700
- Yes.
- Great. 

50:41.900 --> 50:42.600
Stay relaxed and calm. 

50:42.800 --> 50:45.600
I'm too nervous. I swear my legs
aren't attached to my body. 

50:45.800 --> 50:47.800
There's only ever been two
days in my life when I've been this excited. 

50:48.000 --> 50:51.100
The day I first had an injection
and the day I first injected into somebody. 

50:51.300 --> 50:52.100
What's with the injection talk? 

50:52.300 --> 50:55.000
Perhaps I can make an injection
into the girl after the dinner. 

50:55.200 --> 50:58.500
Oh I get it. Ok then,
go on in. 

50:58.700 --> 51:00.200
- Ok, ok, wish me luck.
- Good luck. 

51:00.400 --> 51:02.600
Yes, wish me luck.
Wish me luck, my friend. 

51:03.900 --> 51:06.000
Ok ok, I'll wish you luck brother Recep. 

51:10.200 --> 51:12.600
- Peace be with you, young man.
- Come in sir, welcome. 

51:12.800 --> 51:14.400
- Are you called Fatih?
- Yes sir, I am Fatih. 

51:14.600 --> 51:14.900
A friend of mine has made a reservoir
in my name on table 12. 

51:14.900 --> 51:18.900
A friend of mine has made a reservoir
in my name on table 12.

51:19.100 --> 51:21.400
- You mean a reservation?
- Yes, a reservation. 

51:21.600 --> 51:22.700
Come, it's this way. 

51:22.900 --> 51:24.700
Hold on,
I need to warn you about something. 

51:24.900 --> 51:28.100
The rendez-vous with this girl
is very important to me. 

51:28.300 --> 51:30.300
This is the first time I've
come to SushiCo. 

51:30.500 --> 51:34.200
Whenever I call 'Fatih', you must call me
brother Recep... 

51:34.400 --> 51:36.400
...as if I always come here and
as if you know me very well. Understood? 

51:36.600 --> 51:37.600
Yes sir. 

51:37.800 --> 51:40.400
Then I'll say, Fatih, bring me
what I usually order... 

51:40.600 --> 51:43.500
...and you'll say of course brother Recep,
right away... 

51:43.700 --> 51:45.700
...bring whatever you can find,
just fill the table up. You understand? 

51:45.900 --> 51:47.600
- Understood sir.
- How will you refer to me? 

51:47.800 --> 51:49.700
- Brother Recep
- When I say Fatih, come here? 

51:49.900 --> 51:51.400
- Brother Recep.
- Well done, my man. 

51:51.600 --> 51:54.800
If you make a mistake I'll break your jaw and your nose.
Now piss off. 

51:59.400 --> 52:03.100
Bon appétit. Praise God, your hair is like a shoebrush. 

52:03.500 --> 52:05.400
- Here we are sir.
- Thank you Fatih. 

52:07.800 --> 52:09.300
How many guests will you have? 

52:09.700 --> 52:12.100
There'll only be one girl,
how many do you think? 

52:12.300 --> 52:14.800
Do you take me for a pervert?
We'll dine face-to-face. 

52:15.000 --> 52:17.400
Would you like a cold
drink while you wait for your friend? 

52:17.600 --> 52:20.800
By God, that would be good. Good idea.
Bring me whatever you want. 

52:21.000 --> 52:21.800
Yes sir. 

52:22.000 --> 52:24.500
Hey wait, come back here.
Bring me some bread, some bread. 

52:24.700 --> 52:26.200
We don't have any bread here, brother Recep. 

52:26.400 --> 52:28.700
What are you saying,
you don't have bread here? 

52:29.200 --> 52:31.200
Have I not been your customer
for many years? 

52:31.400 --> 52:34.200
Send someone immediately to
 the market to get me some. 

52:34.400 --> 52:35.600
Right away brother Recep. 

52:35.800 --> 52:39.000
Piss off. Dumb bastard.
Telling me he's got no bread. 

53:00.300 --> 53:01.700
Here you go sir, your bread... 

53:02.100 --> 53:05.000
Thank you my man.
A meal without bread is no meal at all! 

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
- And your wine.
- Thank you. 

53:07.800 --> 53:10.500
You've got to taste it first right?
Quality control. 

53:17.600 --> 53:20.200
No... not very good. This isn't
the exact flavour I want. 

53:20.800 --> 53:22.100
Give me. 

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
No, this won't do either. 

53:30.200 --> 53:31.700
We'll try a bit of the white. 

53:32.700 --> 53:34.000
Thanks. 

53:36.200 --> 53:39.000
I tried it through the nasal cavity,
you see? No, no good, take it away. 

53:44.200 --> 53:46.700
This one's the closest.
But still not it. 

53:46.900 --> 53:48.300
We haven't found the one yet. 

53:48.500 --> 53:50.100
You didn't piss in this one,
did you? 

53:51.500 --> 53:53.300
A bit too strong.
Is it Bavarian? 

53:58.300 --> 54:01.400
That's the last bottle
in the shop sir, there aren't any others left. 

54:09.200 --> 54:10.300
What are you looking at? 

54:11.200 --> 54:12.300
What? 

54:15.200 --> 54:16.900
Nope, this isn't
the taste I'm after. 

54:17.100 --> 54:20.600
The flavour is ok but the roundness
and the body of it isn't as I'd like it to be. 

54:20.800 --> 54:21.800
Here, you can take it back. 

54:22.000 --> 54:24.200
To be honest, I'm not really
much of a wine lover. 

54:24.400 --> 54:25.800
Why do you
keep giving me wine? 

54:26.100 --> 54:28.100
Bring me a barrel of beer. 

54:29.700 --> 54:31.000
Get going.
God! 

54:31.200 --> 54:32.700
Yes sir, brother Recep. 

54:32.900 --> 54:35.900
You just force the customer to drink wine.
Just oblige him to drink the stuff. 

54:38.600 --> 54:41.200
I'm drunk already,
and I haven't even met the girl yet. 

54:45.200 --> 54:48.100
- Karate Kid?
- Yakuza. 

54:48.300 --> 54:49.400
Yes. 

54:51.900 --> 54:53.200
Delighted. 

54:53.400 --> 54:57.800
- The pleasure's all mine.
- But the sweat in your hand... 

54:58.400 --> 55:01.500
You should wipe your hand
before coming to meet someone. 

55:03.200 --> 55:08.200
How do you find me? Am I
as you hoped? 

55:08.900 --> 55:12.700
Do you want me to be frank?
Since we're friends. 

55:13.700 --> 55:17.100
You look
a little fucked up. 

55:17.400 --> 55:20.000
You're the type that should be left in a scrapyard.
Smashed, crushed, decomposed. 

55:20.400 --> 55:23.000
Yes, you might have a good soul. 

55:24.200 --> 55:27.400
Yes, it's worth having a good
soul, but what about the rest? 

55:28.200 --> 55:31.000
After all, we don't live
in a world of spirits. 

55:31.200 --> 55:34.000
Therefore, the external beauty of a woman
is also important to me. 

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
I don't understand you Karate Kid. 

55:36.700 --> 55:39.200
Oh you'll understand,
you'll get to understand. 

55:41.000 --> 55:43.200
- Yes that's it, bring it here.
- And this is Wasabi. 

55:44.800 --> 55:48.100
Look Fatih! You're swimming
in dangerous waters! 

55:49.800 --> 55:53.700
- Oh you are funny, Karate Kid, that's for sure.
- Very well. 

55:55.200 --> 55:57.600
- So do you like sushi a lot?
- Yes, that's true. 

55:58.500 --> 56:00.900
Me too.
For me, it's a way of life. 

56:01.400 --> 56:04.400
I can say that I've been
a fan of sushi since the age of three. 

56:04.700 --> 56:09.500
A way of life, a philosophy of life.
Let me share an anecdote with you. 

56:10.700 --> 56:13.300
When we first came to Istanbul,
I was an only child in my family. 

56:13.600 --> 56:17.300
It's why I became so whimsical,
and I never used to eat anything but sushi. 

56:17.600 --> 56:20.600
Every morning I needed to eat two Nigiri sushis
to wake myself up. 

56:21.100 --> 56:23.700
My mother used to work
in the clothing sector. 

56:23.900 --> 56:25.400
In the Ümraniye neighbourhood. 

56:27.000 --> 56:30.800
I will never forget that day in autumn...

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
...when my mother returned home,
with a bit of bread in her hand. 

56:36.800 --> 56:40.800
We were quite poor
so she put... 

56:41.600 --> 56:43.900
...two california rolls in the bread... 

56:44.500 --> 56:46.700
...and some tempura ebi... 

56:47.800 --> 56:50.200
...and we shared it amongst
ourselves and ate it. 

56:52.300 --> 56:54.400
I always feel bad when
I remember it. 

56:54.800 --> 56:56.300
I always reminisce about those days. 

56:58.400 --> 57:02.000
Today I am able to
dine on king-size and... 

57:02.200 --> 57:04.200
...queen-size plates. 

57:04.400 --> 57:06.200
I've now ended up, after all that, in this good situation. 

57:06.400 --> 57:10.800
My mother used to feed me every
morning with Wasabi. 

57:11.300 --> 57:13.700
I used to eat so much of it. That's why
I am so robust. 

57:13.900 --> 57:16.400
She used to feed me morsel by morsel. 

57:16.700 --> 57:20.200
She put a lot of effort into
bringing me up. My dear mother! 

57:21.000 --> 57:22.100
My mother! 

57:24.600 --> 57:27.200
You see this? This is what the Japanese call
butter. 

57:28.200 --> 57:29.900
I eat this every morning. 

57:30.100 --> 57:31.600
Look, I spread it onto my bread,
you see? 

57:31.800 --> 57:33.900
I take a bit like this. 

57:34.100 --> 57:35.600
Then I spread like so. 

57:35.800 --> 57:38.400
But be careful! Wasabi
is quite spicy, it might sting. 

57:38.600 --> 57:42.000
Spice doesn't affect men like me,
by God! 

57:57.900 --> 57:59.300
What's wrong? 

58:01.100 --> 58:04.100
But I told you
the wasabi is quite hot, didn't I? 

58:10.700 --> 58:13.200
Put some sushi in your mouth.
It will reduce the stinging. 

58:13.600 --> 58:15.000
What, this? 

58:17.100 --> 58:18.300
What the hell is this? 

58:18.500 --> 58:21.100
Nothing, it's just
raw fish. What do you think? 

58:21.300 --> 58:22.800
- Raw fish?
- Yes. 

58:28.600 --> 58:31.200
What's up with you now?
Go away. 

58:41.600 --> 58:45.900
Go to hell!
Disgusting! How much did you eat? 

58:46.100 --> 58:49.800
You might as well have eaten the whole
restaurant! You overgrown oaf! 

58:50.300 --> 58:52.800
Go to hell! 

58:53.000 --> 58:54.700
I am extremely sorry,
forgive me. 

58:54.900 --> 58:58.400
Damn your sushi and your wasabi.
Go to hell! 

58:59.500 --> 59:01.600
Let me go to the toilet. 

59:02.200 --> 59:06.700
Oy! Look me in the eyes when I'm speaking to you. 

59:07.400 --> 59:10.000
Look at what happened to me because of you. 

59:10.200 --> 59:13.000
The only thing I've never eaten is raw fish
and thanks to you I had to go and eat it. 

59:14.400 --> 59:17.000
But what did I do bro?
All I did was to wish you good luck. 

59:17.200 --> 59:19.800
Is pepper spray
my good luck, huh? 

59:21.000 --> 59:24.700
Is raw fish my good luck, heh?
[mimics] "All I did was to wish you good luck." 

59:24.900 --> 59:27.800
"[mimics] I wish you good luck always brother.
Anything for you, anything for you brother." 

59:28.000 --> 59:30.700
-"The girl will be like turkish delight, like turkish delight" .
- But she was! 

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
You half-breed Quasimodo.
Just go do your job and ring bells. 

59:35.300 --> 59:36.800
Idiot. 

59:37.100 --> 59:40.400
You won't find any bitches on
the internet, it's all bullshit. 

59:40.700 --> 59:43.000
We need to go direct to the source. 

59:43.200 --> 59:46.200
Therefore in order to find chicks
we must go to places in high society. 

59:47.200 --> 59:49.600
Yeah right? And where would that be? 

59:49.900 --> 59:51.900
- Yoga for example.
- Yoga? 

59:52.100 --> 59:54.400
- Yes, Yoga.
- We're going to do yoga? 

59:54.600 --> 59:57.900
Yes we'll go to a yoga class.
You'll find super-hot chicks there. 

59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.000
Fine, take the photo quickly,
then let's go for a drink to clear our heads. 

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.100
Then we'll go yoga.
- Ok, but brother Recep you're blocking the light. 

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.100
I'll break your jaw first
then we'll see how I block the light. 

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.000
You'll be seeing stars and angels,
they'll be saying come, come to us young boy... 

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.000
...come to us young one, come... 

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.900
Ay! 

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.600
Hello? Is no one here
to serve customers? 

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.800
Welcome sir.
How may I help you? 

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.400
I'm sorry, I didn't see you come in, love.
I've come to join the yoga class. 

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.700
Very well. We have a
session beginning in half an hour. 

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.200
What kind of yoga would you like to join? 

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.000
- What kinds do you offer?
- We have Feng-shui yoga and Tai-chi yoga. 

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.700
In that case, I'll choose Tahsin's yoga. 

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.600
- Are you going to wear that?
- Yes, of course. 

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.800
I've been wearing this since primary school.
It's high quality genuine, not fake. 

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.600
I see. Very well. 

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.500
You may go in if you wish,
my colleagues will assist you. 

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.800
Cheers. 

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.200
Good day everyone, welcome. 

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.600
We are going to learn
the philosophy of yoga to begin with. 

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400
Peace be with you, master. 

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.500
Let's all do our yogas nicely,
and start up social relationships. 

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.700
Shit, everyone here looks like
a corpse. Why the hell did I come here... 

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.700
Shit, everyone here looks like
a corpse. Why the hell did I come here...

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.000
Here, please sit down. 

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.300
One second, I'm
sitting down. Thank you Master. 

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.400
In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. 

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.400
Let us greet our new friend. 

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:48.100
Ok ladies, yoga is
the art of relaxation and enlightening of the soul. 

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.000
Is this man always relaxed like this? 

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.800
Yes, Master Nilgun is always a
calm and relaxed woman. 

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.400
Yeah yeah, all I see is an idiot.
Where are you from young boy? 

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.400
Yeah yeah, all I see is an idiot.
Where are you from young boy?

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:05.100
First, we'll begin by
relaxing our muscles. 

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.200
Our first movement will be the lotus position. 

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.200
Master, don't chat shit, this is just how we sit
cross-legged at home. 

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.600
No sir, that
cross-legged position you refer to... 

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.300
...is how the tribesmen of
Central Asia sit. 

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.400
The Lotus, however, is one of
the principal positions of yoga... 

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.500
Master, don't try and fool us
with all this talk of lotus-motus. 

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:32.000
For centuries everyone in
Anatolia sat like this and never once talked about lotus. 

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.900
Never mind sir. Now let us move on to
the second movement. 

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.800
Shivava. 

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.300
Hold on, this is something else! Just one second
Master, excuse me. 

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.700
Why are you trying to make us get into these
positions, talking about Chiwawa-miwawa and Central Asia? 

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.100
This is just the position kids get into
to play leapfrog, Master. 

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.000
Stop talking shit,
what Chiwawa? 

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.600
It's just the good old leapfrog
we're playing here. 

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.100
Please, do not interrupt sir. 

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.000
Master, I don't mean to interrupt, but look
at the state of this Irish boy next to me here. 

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.100
My God, never again, I must repent.
Oh Lord above, my dear prophet. 

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.200
Look at what they're forcing us
to do to 'relax' us. 

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.800
For fuck's sake, this perv's just making us bend over
to look at our asses. 

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.400
Is this how I'm supposed to relax, Master? 

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.200
This is too uncomfortable,
how are we supposed to relax like this? 

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400
My arms are shaking all over. 

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.200
Never mind, ok then. Let's return
to our lotus position... 

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.200
Never mind, ok then. Let's return
to our lotus position...

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.100
...and do some meditation
to calm ourselves down. 

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.800
God, she keeps putting me from position to position
and expects me to stay calm. 

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.500
Now let's close our eyes... 

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.700
...and imagine
we're in a forest. 

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.200
Imagine the birds around us... 

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.600
They're closed Master. 

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.500
The butterflies, the flowers,
we are experiencing serenity. 

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.500
The butterflies, the flowers,
we are experiencing serenity.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.800
Let's sleep. 

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.200
Let's relax. 

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.800
Sleep. 

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.300
Silence. 

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.800
Forgive me, Master,
I fell asleep, excuse me. 

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.400
And let us release the evil spirits within us. 

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.400
And let us release the evil spirits within us.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.300
Let's release them. 

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.900
Excuse me master,
you're sure you want me to release them? 

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:38.600
Release...
Let go of the bad. 

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.200
What the hell are you doing? 

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.500
You said let go of my demons,
so I did just that. 

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.600
Don't say oof-poof,
you've been doing it since the beginning of the class. 

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.100
You were releasing it onto the mat.
I could hear you from here. 

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.800
What kind of guy are you, as soon as
your friend gets caught, you start going oof poof! 

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Enough, that's enough!
Get out! What kind of a dirty man are you? 

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.200
I swear to you,
you'll regret this Master. 

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:06.800
You think you're good or something? Look at you,
with your white hair, 

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.800
You think you're good or something? Look at you,
with your white hair,

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.600
You look just like Adnan Senses,
it doesn't suit you at all. 

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.700
You know nothing about yoga,
you know nothing at all! 

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.000
Me, I learned yoga from a real master. 

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.600
I got privately tutored
by the 14th dalai lama in person. 

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.000
Stop talking about master-hasters,
dalai-malay... 

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:29.800
Or I swear I'll introduce my shoe-sole
to your face. 

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.800
Or I swear I'll introduce my shoe-sole
to your face

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.400
What dal-lama are you talking of?
She's talking to all of you. 

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.800
Didn't you hear, she said there
are 14 'dal-lama' [Turkish for pricks] in the class. 

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.200
Look,two, four, five,
fourteen. 

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.400
Get out!

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.700
Piss off, you Gandalf-wannabe.
Come on Scottish boy, let's go. 

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.700
Piss off, you Gandalf-wannabe.
Come on Scottish boy, let's go.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.500
Stand up, let's get out of here. Are you with me
or not Scotty? 

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.200
Let's leave you Scottish bastard.
Let's get the hell out of here. 

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Fuck you.
Look at the state of this place. 

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.200
I can't tell whether
this is a yoga class... 

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.700
...or the morgue of Sisli-Etfal Hospital!
As if I'd find hot girls here! 

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.900
Go on, have fun with these balls. 

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.300
Get out! 

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.200
Shut the hell up! 

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.600
Hey Hakan.
Can I come in? Thanks. 

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.400
I am in disagreement with
the office workers. 

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.000
I decided to get your advice. 

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.100
Should the photocopied documents
be in Times New Roman... 

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.300
...bold italic Verdana,
Tahoma bold, Arial bold italic... 

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.000
...or bold underlined or
Times New Roman? 

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.800
What on earth
are you on about Recep? 

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.800
Excuse me Hakan sir, what shall I do
with these blank invitations? 

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.300
Fuck your
blank invitations... 

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
We're discussing something important here.
Piss off! Get going. 

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.500
I saw you at your desk,
flirting with the tea-trolley man! 

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.600
What were those invitations for
my dear Hakan? 

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.500
Those were invitations for the grand launch
we've organised for the Japanese. 

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.900
And tell me why, oh Hakan, I didn't
also receive an invitation? 

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.400
They're not for you Recep.
What would you do there anyway? 

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.200
Forget it man, the Japanese
would just be chatting nonsense there. What's more, it's an unnerving atmosphere. 

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.400
- Why? I am the vice-boss.
- You'll need to wear a tuxedo as well. 

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.100
What makes you think I don't have a tuxedo,
shithead? 

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.200
- You've got a tux?
- Of course I have. 

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.800
- A dark coloured one?
- Very dark. 

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.200
Fine, then. You can come as well. 

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.300
Good, may God be with you always.
You are an intelligent man. 

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.200
- Can I bring a friend?
- Yes. 

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.600
- He has curly hair, will it be a problem?
- You can bring whoever you want. 

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.400
Thanks. May God be with you. 

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.700
Do we have add a "please call back"
to these invitations? 

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.200
No. 

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.200
Ok, thanks again.
Good, I'll see you there. 

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Don't work too hard, you're looking tired.
You look like a raccoon, a raccoon for goodness sake. 

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.800
Isn't there a better quality shop
than this? This place is quite crap. 

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.600
Listen, you won't find any better
than this. We're in Modesan after all, you know. 

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.500
This is my friend Metin's shop. One day,
Metin will make it real big, he'll be the market leader. 

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.800
Hey hey, my man Recep.
Welcome back. 

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.300
Peace be with you brother Metin. 

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.399
And also with you my dear friend.
So how can I help you? 

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.399
Bro, let me lay it out for you-
I've gotta meet some Japanese... 

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.100
...so I'll need a smart tuxedo, that'd
suit the atmosphere. 

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.800
Let me tell you something.
I swear you're one lucky man. 

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.000
We couldn't tailor such a suit
even if you gave us a year to do it. 

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:54.200
But I've got a Japanese suit,
with some designs on the back. 

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:56.899
Try it on, you'll see. 

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.200
When you enter that room,
even if there are one and a half thousand in there... 

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.300
...all eyes will be on you.
- Alright give me it, I'll try it right away. 

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:02.800
- As you wish, right away.
- My friend here also needs a costume. 

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.800
- As you wish, right away.
- My friend here also needs a costume.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
We need to also
find him a good design... 

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.399
...otherwise he'll feel left out,
unfortunate wretch. 

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.500
Sure. There's a lot of
clothes here my boy. 

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.700
It's all on me by the way. Hakan's paid me
my first salary, 200 TL. 

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.200
Wow, wow, wow. This is one top
class jacket... 

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200
Wow, wow, wow. This is one top
class jacket...

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.100
Wear it with joy. 

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.300
Bro, it's texture is excellent,
but isn't it a bit too glossy? 

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.600
Oh no, not at all. There's nothing else
more original. 

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.899
Look, it fits
you perfectly. 

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.500
- Brother, I don't think it's so good...
- And why would you say that, idiot? 

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.399
You know nothing about fashion.
I am a fashion expert. 

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.399
Yeah, what do you understand about the world
of fashion? Imbecile, Imbecile! 

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.200
He is the expert on fashion.
Metin brother, get him out. 

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.000
What an idiot. What kind of clothes
he wears, no fashion sense at all. 

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:56.400
But this is today's youth-
all ignoramuses. Never listen to them. 

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.500
Look here, this emblem on the chest, this is
the badge of the Prime Minister of Japan. 

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.500
Turn around. See, the same on the back. 

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.700
Everyone is going
to be awed by you. 

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.600
You be sure you wear it to the ball. 

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.000
Oy lanky, come here. 

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.400
Now piss off. 

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.200
Look at her walking in front,
trying to show off. 

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.600
You know, the jacket didn't look
great in the shop... 

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.000
...but in here it looks really good on you. 

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.100
Look kid, I told you, the man was a
fashion guru. 

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.000
The guy told me: "the material might not
look that great here,..." 

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.400
"but when you go to that party,
it'll soak up all the ambience and electricity there... 

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.200
...and shine it on their faces". 

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.800
- He was right.
- Of course he was right. 

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.400
- Would you like some?
- We would. What is it? 

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.400
- Canapé vol-au-vents, sir.
- Canapé? 

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.800
Look at the size of the canapé,
but then look at the size of my buttocks. 

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.900
How would this size of canapé
ever fill me up? 

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.600
Even if you considered just one of my arse-cheeks,
the canapé would be nowhere near enough! 

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.100
Take one. 

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.700
I'll take some. 

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.100
- Tastes real good.
- Yeah. Let's try this one as well. 

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.600
- Your health.
- What is this? 

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.600
- It is caviar, sir.
- What the hell is caviar? 

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.200
The eggs of fish. 

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.600
May God punish you for what you've done! 

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.100
Piss off! Making us eat the dirtiest part of
fish, we spent a million dollars on catering in this party! 

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.100
Piss off! Making us eat the dirtiest part of
fish, we spent a million dollars on catering in this party!

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.400
- The most disgusting part of the fish!
- What are you doing bro? 

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.900
You don't expect me to eat
the shit of fish now do you? 

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.700
Sir, they wish to thank you for
this marvellous, wonderful reception. 

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.200
I'm the one who should thank you.
You came a very long way. Thank you. 

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.500
Hi l am very big fun of yours.
When your player for the Gullit? Gullit? 

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.200
Hi! Mrs. India!
where are you yaaa? 

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.100
- Are you mad?
- For the Kenya? 

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.700
Meto! Meto! Look!
Look at that man. 

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.400
It's the logo
of our organisation. 

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.000
Yes. yes. 

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.200
That guy must be the underworld boss
of the Middle East! 

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.300
It must be him for sure. 

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.200
Sir, they are very interested
in that man over there. 

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.000
They say they would like
to make his acquaintance. 

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.000
Recep. Recep. Over here! 

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.600
- Me?
- Come, brother, come. 

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.900
What's up Hakan? 

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:04.600
These are our Japanese clients,
they wanted to make your acquaintance. 

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.900
Hiroshi, Makato, Meto. 

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.400
Nice to meet you Meto, pleasure to
have met you also Makato... 

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.200
And same to you Hiroshi.
I really like the Japanese. 

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
These are very respectable people.
Very bold men. 

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.500
You know, I actually speak Japanese very well. 

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400
Don't fuck me there, fuck me here. 

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.500
What if these guys understand Turkish... 

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.600
Look, here's another one.
Shoved it in too far, had to withdraw. 

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.800
Ah yes, of course you'd laugh like this. 

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:39.700
This is
turkish comedy. Turkish joke. 

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.400
You three are great guys,
I respect you very much. 

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.900
You are most welcome in our
country. Welcome my lions, my bulls. 

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.500
Sir, they are asking for your
permission to go to the bathroom. 

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.400
They may go, but translate this well: tell them to
aim properly ok? 

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.000
I don't want to see any splashes on the sides.
Remind them to lift the lid too. 

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.900
Bruv, you're turning this place into a
stable. What are you playing at? Oof. 

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.400
What do you mean, this is called human relations.
Mutual human relations. 

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.700
This is an international language, man.
I showed them my warmth, affection, my friendliness. 

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.600
I showed them my Turkish side. 

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.800
What nonsense are you talking, Recep?
These are not your close friends. 

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.200
The situation is awkward enough already. 

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.200
Excuse me, but the situation is awkward
only because your party is like my ass. 

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.000
I'm sorry, but you've organised this party
like a funeral home- it's a disgrace! 

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.000
Look, I've spared no expense,
I even got the best DJ. 

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.400
Everything is perfect, man. 

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.600
A real party wouldn't be like this.
The DJ, the atmosphere wouldn't be like this. 

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.400
You should have left it to me,
entertainment, that's my job. 

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.900
I'm begging you Recep, please don't do anything.
Please, just stay aside. 

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.700
Ok, you just enjoy yourself...
Where's the DJ's cabin? DJ! 

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:54.600
Excuse me bro, does your
music setup... 

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.600
Excuse me bro, does your
music setup...

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.300
...have a USA memory card slot?
- Yes sir. 

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.400
- Where my friend?
- Here. 

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.400
Ah yes, it's a very beautiful slot.
Very beautiful. 

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.600
- Oh God! Look they're towing away a car!
- Where? 

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.900
Look over there, they're towing
a car away, is it yours? 

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.400
- I don't know, I'll go see.
- Go on, have a look idiot. 

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.900
They're taking your car.
What an idiot... 

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.700
His IQ is zero, and still dreaming of DJing, huh.
Alright, let's see. 

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.100
Music out, the other CD in... 

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.500
Dance! Dance you pussies!

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.800
YEAAAH! This is real fun. 

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.700
Sir, they cannot accept the campaign
launch in October. 

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.700
Sir, they cannot accept the campaign
launch in October.  

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.000
They say they cannot sign
to these conditions. 

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.100
But we've already discussed the
terms of the agreement. 

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.600
Why have they changed their minds now?
Ask them. 

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.300
Come on, my son. Do it for me. 

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.300
Come on, my son. Do it for me.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.900
Please go and shut him up.  

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.400
Come on, come to daddy... 

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.700
Run to me my boy. 

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.500
Mr Recep sir, a little quiet, please.
There's a meeting going on inside at the moment. 

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.600
If there is a meeting, you should have
called me as well, my friend. 

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.600
Sit down, sit down, it's alright. These Japanese
kids are really respectable chaps. 

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.100
What's going on here then Hakan? 

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.500
- We are in a meeting right now.
- So why didn't you call me? 

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.300
- Aren't I the vice-boss?
- Look, everything is already messed up as it is. 

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.600
- What the hell's happened?
- They don't want to sign the agreement. 

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.400
What, these lot, they're refusing to sign? 

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.800
Don't worry, I'll sort it.
Stand aside, stay back. 

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.800
What seems to be the problem, fellas? 

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:03.000
Takashi, Makat? Hiroshi? Huh? 

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.200
What the fuck is your problem? You
think you're good now or something? 

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.800
Huh? Have you come all the way here
to play around with us? 

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.200
You bastards, you've been eating
and drinking our food for three days... 

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.600
and you're staying free of charge at
a top hotel, thanks to this boy! 

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.700
These guys have been working on this deal
for four months! 

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.200
So what's your friggin' problem? 

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.600
Be real men. 

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.300
Be real men
and make sure you don't piss me off! 

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.900
I swear I'll smash your skulls,
I swear it by God! 

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.700
I swear I'll shove my shoes in your face,
so don't make me mad! 

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.400
Look, he's my cousin- anything you do to him,
you do to me. 

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.000
In my opinion, I think we should sign. 

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.400
Quick, quick, he's the mob kingpin... 

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.700
...we simply must sign right away. 

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.300
Get on with it, translate what I said,
they have ten seconds to sign. 

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.700
That's it, now we're in harmony. 

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.500
You see, if we can apply like this
we can have harmonisation across all of Europe. 

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.500
If you wish,
we could have mutual relations. 

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.300
We could meet many times,
we could even go see you in Tokyo. 

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.300
You could come here too, we'd arrange marriages,
get some new relations between our families. 

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.900
Is that ok, Hakan? 

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.900
They signed,
I'm not dreaming am I? 

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.200
- Yes, of course they signed.
- Recep, you're a genius. 

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.300
Idiot, don't make daft gestures. 

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.700
Bruv, these guys are giants in their sector, market leaders.
We've got them on our side. 

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:30.300
If it weren't for me you would have humiliated us
in front of these giants. World giants! 

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.300
Move your arm idiot, do you want to get it broken?
Keep working hard, son. 

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:35.300
Move your arm idiot, do you want to get it broken?
Keep working hard, son.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.000
Send my shoes to my office afterwards. 

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.100
Is that really their signature? 

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:43.000
It is my utmost pleasure to invite
to the stage, the owner of the Alaaddin advertising company, 

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.600
The company that signed the biggest advertising contract of the year: 

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.500
...Mr Hakan...
Hakan Ivedik. 

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.900
Bravo boss. 

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.300
Go forth my lion, my lion! 

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.700
Thank you very much.
It's so good to see you all here. 

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:08.300
Our company has become
a world leader... 

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.200
...in a very short amount of time. 

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.600
But the real architect of this achievement
is my brother, my cousin... 

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.600
...my business partner, Recep Ivedik. 

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.400
For this reason, I think that
Recep Ivedik should be taking this stage instead of me. 

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.900
Recep, could you please come up here... 

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.300
No Hakan, no, sort it out yourself,
don't get me involved in this please. 

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.500
Please Recep, don't disappoint us.
Let's all give him a round of applause, for encouragement. 

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.500
Stop clapping! Don't applaud!
I said stop clapping, idiots! 

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.100
Thank you, thank you so much.
May God be with you all. 

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:49.000
- Wait till I....
- AAAAHH!!! GOD, GOD, a dead cat! A dead cat! 

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.600
By God, I'll break your mouth. 

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.600
Excuse me. 

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.500
And here he is, Recep Ivedik. 

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.300
But what the hell should I say?
What the fuck am I going to talk about? 

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.900
Just talk about globalisation,
about the economy, come on you'll be fine. 

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.000
Alright then. Get lost now. 

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.400
Yes, I greet you all with respect. 

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.200
First of all,
I must say it surprises me... 

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.200
First of all,
I must say it surprises me...  

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.400
...to see so many bigwigs in Istanbul. 

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.700
You're all like beads on
a string. Be like real men, why don't you. 

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:36.000
I would like to tell you a bit about a philosophy
which I've followed since childhood. 

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.600
The grasshopper and the ant. 

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.500
The grasshopper and the ant
were in the field, when...

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.800
...the ant said "Listen well my son,
because... 

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.400
...of global warming caused by globalisation... 

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.300
...the dollar will surge
and the price of a barrel of oil will fall." 

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.400
"So be clever
and work hard like a man". 

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.600
The grasshopper responded,"What the hell do you know?
You live under the ground. 

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.000
You live in a little hole,
all you do is carry the shit of people... 

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.800
...to your house.
Why should I listen to you?" 

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.300
"You swim in people's saliva
as though it were a swimming pool, get lost!". 

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.000
The ant replied, "We will see later."
And then he left. 

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.200
The winter came, and one day the ant was having a sex party in his house...

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.600
with about 25 of his friends,
boys and girls, they were having a fun. 

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.700
When suddenly someone knocked at the door. 

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.600
He opened the door, and saw the grasshopper there,
dishevelled and exhausted. 

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.800
"Do you remember," said the ant "in the summer
when I spoke with you in the field?" 

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.800
"Would you be kind enough to give me some rice
and a box of butter" asked the grasshopper. 

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
The ant replied "But you are truly
an idiot... 

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.600
...a dishonourable wretch." 

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.800
I warned you, he said. 

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.600
"Remember, when I was carrying a sunflower seed on my back,
I warned you didn't I? 

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.200
...I warned you didn't I!" he said.
"If I hadn't I wouldn't... 

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.200
...I warned you didn't I!" he said.
"If I hadn't I wouldn't...  

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.600
...get this angry, you bastard!" 

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.400
The grasshopper replied:
"What the fuck are you shouting for?"

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.200
Don't piss me off,
I'm really not in the mood for it. 

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.800
The ant replied: "Get the fuck out of here,
or... 

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
...I swear to God I'll call the raccoons." 

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.400
"You fuck off!" said the grasshopper. 

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.400
He grabbed the ant's antennae,
and broke his hind leg... 

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.900
...there was a terrible fight,
with blood flowing everywhere. 

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.700
It went on till the evening. 

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.300
Anyway, I don't know why I told you all this,
but in the end, to conclude... 

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.500
...as they say, the seals are very
lonely. 

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.600
In short, I feel most aggrieved. 

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.100
In a world where we lose 45cm of glacier ice every day
from our planet, damn it all... 

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.100
In a world where we lose 45cm of glacier ice every day
from our planet, damn it all...

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.800
I'm telling you, it's fucked up...
All fucked up I tell you. 

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.400
I have one principle. 

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:30.800
Listen well; before the wheat begins to bud
the blind calf does not limp. 

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.700
I salute you all with utmost respect. 

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.400
Take the photos. 

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.900
Son of a donkey, you've been using my
phrases again? 

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.500
But those words are mine grandma... 

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.500
Oh yeah? 

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.000
Before the crop begins to bud
the blind calf does not limp... 

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.100
...that's my words. 

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.700
God, it's so difficult to satisfy you.
Look, I've bought you a PlayStation 3. 

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:02.900
Ok, you got me a PS3, but I want a high
definition TV as well. 

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.900
Alright, I'll buy you a television
in high definition. 

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.000
Good. And what
have you done about your girl problem? 

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.300
One thing at a time, grandma.
I can't do everything at once! 

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.400
When are you going to get married?
When will you find a nice girl? 

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.300
When are you going
to show her to me? 

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.400
I'll show you the girl
when I bring your television. 

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.700
Come, let me fuck
you over at a game of PES. 

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.400
Quick, get over here. You've spoken enough,
that'll do. 

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.000
Alright, let's play on the PS3.
Let me just install it first. 

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.600
Ok, but we'll see
who's going to get fucked over by who. 

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.400
Maybe I'll fuck you over twice and
you might once. 

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:30.900
Get a move on. 

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.300
- Why the hell did you bring me here?
- Golf is a way of life, man. 

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.400
It's time for you to learn new things
like this. 

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.600
Is this game based on
çelik çomak (turkish cricket)? 

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.800
Not really.
Let me just show you how it's done. 

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.600
Now look, the feet should be
parallel to the ball like so. 

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.900
Like this? 

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.200
No, no not like that.
Turn them a bit this way. 

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.100
Like this? 

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.400
No, no. A bit more to the right. Parallel. 

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.100
Like this, huh? 

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.600
Yeah, that's good. Now bend your thighs
a little. 

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.600
Ok.
Good. Splendid. 

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.400
Oh, you mean the shit-taking position. 

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.900
Well, not quite. Ah.
Raise your chest a bit more. 

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.800
Keep your chest upright. 

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.700
- What the hell are you doing?
- Recep, a bit higher. 

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.500
Oy! What the fuck do you think you're doing? 

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.800
I'm just showing you how, man. 

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.600
How can someone try to fuck their own cousin
pretending to teach him! 

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.300
Recep man,
I'm just trying to teach you to play golf here. 

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.900
You brought me to this quiet field
to teach me golf... 

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.200
...but all you're doing is trying to forcefully enter my anus!
You worthless prick! 

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.900
- You might as well take me into the forest while you're at it!
- Look, people are staring, keep it down. 

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:43.300
Move the fuck away!
Get into your little green square! 

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.800
If you think you know so much,
just do it yourself. For God's sake! 

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Just watch me, you idiot. 

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.900
What happened there, heh? Huh??
Shithead, what was that then? 

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.700
My grandfather was one of the best golfers around,
he used to play on a horse. 

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.500
Like this, on the horse,
he used to throw it like this, from the horse. 

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.000
This game was passed down from our forefathers! 

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.700
I'll be at the 14th.
I'll wait for you there. 

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.300
I've been playing for eight years,
and I've never hit it as far as that. 

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.700
I can't believe it.
I will never play golf again. 

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.200
What are you doing?
- Move the fuck out of the way! 

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.200
- I'm trying to take a shot here.
- Stand aside my friend. 

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.200
Does this field belong to your father or something? 

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400
My friend, are you looking for a fight? 

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.600
- Just get out of my face
- Just fuck off to the side! 

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.000
- We're playing golf, can't you see?
- My car needs to go through here! 

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.600
- Calm down bruv.
- Alright, I'll smash your head with this lever. 

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.300
I swear, I'm going to break your mouth with this
lever! By God I swear! 

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.400
- Recep, what are you playing at, man?
- What, what? What's your problem grandad? 

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.400
Recep man, just leave it.
We're on a golf course, what are you doing? 

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.200
I've told you politely!
I'll just split your head in two, like this. 

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.800
But bruv, this is a golf course.
You can't fight here. 

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.600
You think you're a hero or something? 

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.200
Sorry. 

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.000
Mate, I'm in deep shit
with my grandmother you know. 

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:20.400
-Just because I look like this, don't think I've got it easy.
- Grandma's really old though... 

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.700
She might be old,
but her brain functions really well. 

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.800
She just keeps yelling at me, find a job, find a job,
get respect, get respect... 

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.800
She just keeps yelling at me, find a job, find a job,
get respect, get respect...

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.700
And now, get married, get married.
 I'm under huge pressure you know.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:38.200
Bro, everything'll be fine.
One day, a girl will turn up and you'll get married. 

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.200
You know, it was your help that I
managed to get a job. 

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.000
The same goes for how I gained respect. 

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.300
All that's left is to find one girl,
we need to find a solution. 

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.300
Don't worry about it. 

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:50.400
- You like the tomato?
- Very nice. Is it a village tomato? 

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.800
No man, it's not from the village,
it's organic, organic. 

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.600
I paid 35 TL (~£20) per kilo for them. 

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.100
I always eat organic food. 

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:02.200
Man, if you had brought a swiss-knife or something,
we could have cut it into pieces. 

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.400
What do you need a swiss-knife for?
Rid yourself of these posh tendencies. 

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.200
You just take the tomato
and put your fist in, like this. 

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.500
That's how it's done.
Here. 

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:17.600
Oy! What is this? This? 

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.600
Sorry. 

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.100
Go play somewhere else!
Go, move to another field! 

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.500
Calm down. 

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.000
We're having a nice picnic here and you're chucking balls at our heads! 

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.000
If it comes here one more time,
I swear I'll cut your balls off! 

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.900
I swear I'll just chop them off!
Piss off! 

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.000
Are you crazy? 

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.200
Stop making hand signals from there!
You'll get an egg chucked on your head, I tell you. 

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:47.100
I'll lob tomatoes on your heads!
Don't make me mad! 

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.200
- Ali Kerem?
- Yes, my dear. 

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.800
I'm having a birthday party this weekend.
You coming? 

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:00.600
'Course I am,
I wouldn't miss it. 

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.200
It's a fancy dress party.
You have to wear peculiar costumes. 

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.100
- Yeah I will.
- Fine, see you there. 

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.000
Oy, look, I'll come as well, yeah?
I'll come, yeah? 

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.900
- Brother, shall we go?
- She didn't invite me. 

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.200
- There'll be some interesting girls there...
- Look man, I'm not invited. 

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.300
- So what, we'll still go.
- But she didn't invite me to the party you idiot. 

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.000
- Whatever man, we can still go.
- Why the fuck are you rubbing it in? 

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.300
Fucking rubbing it in my face,
just because you got invited and I didn't! 

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:26.300
Fucking rubbing it in my face,
just because you got invited and I didn't!

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.400
- We'll photocopy an invitation, don't worry.
- Shut up, don't come near me. 

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.200
Curly haired monkey! 

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.900
Not only did you force me to come
to this party uninvited... 

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.100
...but you make me come disguised as a bunny rabbit. 

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.000
Where's your head at, idiot? 

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.400
Don't get angry man.
You actually look quite cute in that. 

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.800
Oh Lord God, for the sake of the prophet, give me patience... 

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.800
Look, go and chat with those girls.
There's so many of them there. 

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.400
- Where?
- Over there. 

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.500
- Those are girls?
- Yeah. 

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.500
These things you call girls, all I see is an elephant,
a monkey... 

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:25.200
...and even an orang-utang! 

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.400
So what, and you're a rabbit.
You'll get along just fine... 

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:30.300
I'll just give you a slap across
the face and you'll see how fine I am. 

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.800
Get with the mood, man.
Be a bit more sociable. 

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.200
Shut up idiot, don't try and teach me how to be
sociable. I know how to start my own relationships. 

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.600
Hey you, you're Snow White? 

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.800
Listen, make sure you don't eat anything
that witch is gonna give you, understand?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.600
Don't forget, if she tries giving you
an apple, it'll be poisoned. 

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.700
Observe carefully the source
of the fruit. 

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.600
Oy, I'll smash your face in and take your eyes out! 

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.600
I saw you in that film.
I know what you're up to! 

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.000
Madam, I'm in a spot of bother
with this costume... 

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.300
...would you please be able to
measure my blood pressure? 

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.600
- Ok, I will.
- Go on. 

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.700
- Very high.
- Very high, isn't it? 

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.600
- Your heart's beating real fast as well.
- It must be because of the watermelons. 

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.200
Can you measure my
other pressure as well? 

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.900
Do I have to tell you where to measure that pressure from, eh? 

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.400
Two cheddar cheese toasted
sandwiches, and a small cup of tea. 

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.400
Go on, quickly now!
Hurry and bring it to me. 

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.000
Give unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar.
Get the fuck out of here, knob. 

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.200
- Your costume really suits you.
- Thanks, yours too. 

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.100
You're a genuine ass-giver, right? Piss off! 

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.600
How dare you punch?
Piss off, twat. 

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.900
Fucking nuisance. 

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:50.300
Mona Lisa?
Mary Claire? 

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.200
Marilyn Manson?
Marilyn Monroe. 

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.400
It's true you had an affair with Einstein,
isn't it? 

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.200
-No, no.
-Is it true
he fucked you? 

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.100
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, walking
around like a clown? Piss off, get lost. 

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.700
Look at him, pervert.
Trying to get close to Marilyn Monroe. 

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:15.300
Ahaaa! So an American wrestler, huh? 

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.800
If it's American wrestling you want,
that's what you'll get, son! 

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.200
I can take anyone! 

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.400
Ooof, I swear I can't take any more of this. 

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.000
Where's that bastard Ali Kerem?
Where is that kid? 

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.000
Mummmy!!! You fucker, I ought to break your jaw.
I'll smash your jaw, I swear! 

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.100
Bro, why are you hitting me?
It's me. 

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.200
Why the hell are you trying to scare me? 

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.300
What's to be scared,
my costume's like this. 

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.000
Idiot, you don't need
to wear a costume to look like a monkey... 

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.400
...you're face already looks like a baboon's.
Shithead. 

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.600
How's it going, Ali Kerem?
Love your costume. 

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.500
Thanks. 

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.800
- Your costume is really nice too.
- Thank you, may God be pleased with you my child. 

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.700
- What is it? A grizzly bear, isn't it?
- Does this look like a grizzly bear? 

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.900
Look what I've got on my head. Look.
Two long ears on the head. 

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.300
Look at my buttocks as well,
look at the fluffy tail. 

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.700
Look, my palms are white as well.
Where the fuck have you ever seen a grizzly bear like this? 

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.400
I'm sorry, but
when I saw your face I thought you were a bear. 

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.800
Shut the fuck up! 

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.300
Shut it! 

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.600
She looks at me and thinks
I'm a bear. 

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.200
When I saw you, I thought
you were a retard. You dumb fuck. 

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.800
Look at her hair,
looks like a friggin' table lamp. 

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.900
We might as well put on a couple of candles
to light at night. Retard. 

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:49.100
Get lost, little girl!
Disgrace! Disgrace! 

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
- Calm down, bro, it's ok.
- Animal! 

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.000
It's Grandma. Open the phone cover.
My hands are full. Open it. 

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.000
- What?
- Hello Recep, it's me your grandmother, your grandmother. 

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.500
- Yes grandma.
- There's too much noise. 

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.900
I can't hear you.
Where are you, you good-for-nothing? 

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:11.000
Grandma, forgive me,
I'm in a costume party. 

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.200
I'm here with my future wife.
Her family organised it so we could get to know each other. 

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:15.500
- The girl's whole family are animals.
- I'm not well at all, I think my time has come. Hurry. 

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:19.500
- The girl's whole family are animals.
- I'm not well at all, I think my time has come. Hurry.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:22.100
- Where are you?
- I'm on the way to the hospital, my son. 

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:26.300
-Which hospital?
Which hospital are you going to?
- Which hospital, child? 

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.800
- Numune Hospital.
- She says we're going to the Numune Hospital. 

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.200
Ok, ok, hang up, I'm coming right away.
I'm coming immediately. 

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.500
Bring my future daughter-in-law, son, my
daughter-in-law. 

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.400
- Lie back madam.
- Shut the hell up! 

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.600
Bring my future daughter-in-law,
otherwise, I'll never forgive you. 

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.600
Fine, I'll bring her.
I'll bring her to you, grandma. 

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.900
Please don't worry, just make sure you get well.
Alright, close the phone. 

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:49.200
Never mind Recep, keep talking my boy,
I'm using the nurse's telephone. 

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.800
The bill will go up her ass, not ours. 

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.100
- Madam?
- What? 

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.300
- I'll take my phone back please.
- You can't have it. 

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:59.600
It's just 2 or 3 lira credit, why are you
so worried, you she-devil? 

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.200
- Bruv, what happened?
- Something really bad, man. 

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:06.200
Where's Hakan?
Take this shit off your face! 

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.400
Walking around with a 'Z' across his face.
I'm telling you, something bad's happened. 

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.000
They're taking grandma to hospital.
- Alright let's get going, quick. 

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.800
Yes we must go urgently. 

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.400
But I also told grandma I'd bring my
future wife with me as well. 

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.000
- Shit, where'll we find a girl now?
- No idea. 

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.900
We need to go there with someone we know
and trust. 

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:21.900
- Yeah. 

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.000
I've got one or two ideas, Ali Kerim. 

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.600
- What's that then?
- I've got a very excellent idea. 

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.600
Hakan, come with me. 

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.200
My boy,
what on earth is that thing you're wearing? 

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.100
Grandma, I'm now with high class society. 

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:45.800
This is a sign of richness.
To show their wealth, they cover the whole body with fur. 

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:46.800
Hakan, Hakan, what is that costume you're wearing?
Have you joined a religious sect? 

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.800
Hakan, Hakan, what is that costume you're wearing?
Have you joined a religious sect?

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.100
No grandma, they gave me a cloak
because I was feeling a bit cold. 

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.700
My son, have you brought me my daughter-in-law? 

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.200
Grandma, when have I ever let you down?
Come on Gran... 

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.600
I always do what you ask,
so of course I brought her. 

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.600
Come here my dear,
let me introduce you to my grandmother. 

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.600
Come my beautiful, my love. 

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.600
- I hope wou get well soon, grandma.
- Ay, what is this, what an ugly girl! 

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.600
Is this the best you could find, my son? 

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.600
Oh well, she might be a bit ugly, but what could I do?
It's love... 

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.000
and love can land on a piece of shit and still affect the heart.
- But this one is even worse than shit! 

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.800
- Bruv, I'm starting to take this seriously...
- Don't call me 'bruv bruv' in front of grandma. 

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.700
Otherwise I'll punch you so hard you'll
fly into intensive care. 

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.700
Isn't that so my love?
Oh my darling. 

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:35.300
My son, I want you to do one last thing.
This is my last wish. 

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.000
Tell me grandma, I'm always ready
to do whatever you ask of me. 

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.700
- You know that mahogany chest, my son?
- Yes, I know it. 

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.800
- You know that mahogany chest...
- Yeah, the mahogany chest. 

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.700
My God, the poor woman has passed on!
Grandma! Grandma... 

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.000
Ah, she came back. 

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.300
- There's a mahogany chest, my boy...
- Yes, the mahogany chest, I got it. 

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.200
- That mahogany chest, my little Recep...
- I know, I know, tell me the rest of it! 

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.200
- That mahogany chest, my little Recep...
- I know, I know, tell me the rest of it!

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.400
Lord Almighty! She keeps saying mahogany chest and
goes to the other world without managing to finish!  

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.400
Lord Almighty! She keeps saying mahogany chest and
goes to the other world without managing to finish!

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:14.000
Grandma! Grandma!
Look, she's back again, she's alive. 

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.600
- The mahogany chest...
- Look, I swear I'll stop the serum now... 

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.700
...tell me quickly what's in that mahogany
chest. 

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.600
Ah my little Recep,
you know, the mahogany chest... 

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.600
I got it Grandma,
there's a mahogany chest! 

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.400
Finish your sentence
for the love of God! 

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.100
I hope it goes up your anus! 

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.000
You see, she insulted me. 

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.200
She made her last joke,
she's attached the mahogany chest to my ass and left for the hereafter. 

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.800
By God! Stop staring,
quickly, go get the doctors! 

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.600
Doctor! Doctor!
Isn't there a doctor around?? 

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.900
Come on doctor,
see if you can save her! 

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:50.800
Are you going to
save my grandma doctor? 

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.300
Are you going to
save my grandma doctor?

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.800
What a bastard. 

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.300
He must have crushed the poor woman. 

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.000
God. 

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.600
Hey, does it smell of feet? 

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.800
No. 

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.400
Ah, my dear grandma... 

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.100
She was always sitting on this sofa... 

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.100
She was always playing PlayStation here.
You know, she was always looking out for me. 

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:00.100
She was always playing PlayStation here.
You know, she was always looking out for me.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.700
She always desired me to be successful. 

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.600
The poor woman, she didn't
have a single tooth left in her mouth... 

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.900
... she used to speak
'bob, bob, bob'... 

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.900
just like a chicken, sitting here. 

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.300
Look, she made me write down a list
of the things she wanted me to do. 

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.700
I found the job.
And I got the respectability. 

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.300
But now I have no need to
make a family. 

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.000
In truth, my grandma
was my only family. 

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.100
Don't talk like an idiot, Recep,
are we not family? 

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:43.100
- Who are we? What is your surname?
- Ivedik. 

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.600
- And what's mine?
- Ivedik. 

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.600
We are the Ivediks.
No one can hold us back. 

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.600
We'll manage the company
together. 

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.200
I'm always at your side.
End of story... 

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.000
Don't bullshit Hakan. I don't
want to hold you behind. 

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.800
No, my dear Recep,
nothing will happen to us, don't worry. 

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.600
Yeah bro. It's exactly like he said.
I'm with you too. 

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.500
Easy, easy.
Eat slowly! 

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.000
Eat slowly, you animal, you'll die! 

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.500
Don't put it there, move it! 

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.600
Putting the dish on the mahogany chest! 

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.900
Putting the dish on my grandmother's
mahogany chest! 

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.400
- Sorry.
- Shameless dog! 

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.400
You curly-haired wannabe clown! 

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:24.000
- My condolences.
- Thank you, thanks for your support. 

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.800
Thank you. Thank you.
That's a very nice scarf. 

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:26.800
My condolences. 

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.200
Thank you. Thank you.
Same to you. Oy, what's your height? 

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.700
- Thanks. Say hello to brother Mehmet from me.
Say hi to your son. 

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:33.200
My condolences. 

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.800
Thank you. Amen, amen.
Thank you my dear aunt. 

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.100
My condolences. 

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.300
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you all. 

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.100
Is that a noise? Oh right, were you here?
Sorry, didn't see you there. 

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.200
Thank you my dear. Thank you.
Oh God, my God. 

01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.300
- Thank you, dear friend.
- If you're ever in need, please give me a call. 

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.700
I'll call you. Don't worry. 

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.300
- My dear Recep.
- My dear Hakan. 

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.000
Go on holiday and get your head back to normal. 

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.100
- You can come back to company whenever you want.
- Fine, thanks. 

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.900
See you later. 

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.400
My God!
This is a house of mourning! 

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.400
My God!
This is a house of mourning!  

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:16.400
This is a house of death!
All they did was sit here... 

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:19.300
and eat the sweet dish,
and then fucked off like a herd of buffaloes. 

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.300
Just leave me alone,
leave me by myself. 

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:24.100
I'm suffering! 

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.600
Oh my Lord. 

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.800
What the hell is this? 

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.800
Look at that,
she did it to me again. 

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.600
My poor dear. 

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.400
God Almighty. 

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.000
What gave you the idea to take a photo like this?
I don't understand it. 

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.400
Where on earth did you get this taken?
Who took this photo? I don't get it. 

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.800
She must have forced
the women in the neighbourhood... 

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.900
...to take the photo. 

01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:01.700
Surely, nothing else
could have come out of this chest. 

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.300
When I asked what was in it... 

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.500
...you always answered, you'll see when I die.
What was in it? 

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.700
You'll see when I die.
You've done it again. 

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.500
You've made me laugh again. 

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:24.400
I'm going to miss you a lot.
You left me so many tasks... 

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.700
And now you've left without seeing them accomplished. 

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.400
My poor, dear grandmother! 

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.100
It makes me laugh every time I look at it. 

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.900
What the hell are you doing? 

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.700
The girl is a savage. 

01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.000
Bro, why are you trying to get with a girl
you don't know? 

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.400
She's an Indian beauty... 

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.300
I know what you're thinking... 

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.300
- Thanks.
- Piss off. 

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.300
Next. 

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.100
Wait a moment.
Peace be with you. 

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.500
What are you moving out of the way for? 

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.000
Good evening ladies and gentle... 

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Good evening ladies and gentle...

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.900
A grandfather with a white beard:
come here my child, come here... 

01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:53.800
Don't laugh, don't laugh. 

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.000
Sorry, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable, it was too high... 

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:03.600
Come on say it.
Fill in the blanks, come on! 

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.400
Well done. Very good.
Oy, get this pipe out the way. 

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.800
Lift me up, lift me up man. 

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.600
Where'd it go? 

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.500
I won't go if
I'm not invited. 

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.000
Come on, let's go. 

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.600
I'm coming too, right? 

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.300
- Let's go.
- I told you I'm not invited! 

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.600
I'll take a shit right in
your mouth. 

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.600
You neither bring me a bonsai,
nor a golden coltsfoot... 

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:48.100
- Ah yes.
- I swear I'll... 

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.300
We're playing for money, right?
Yeah, for money. 

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.200
Makes no difference. Oh my God!. 

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.100
God... the sofa.
I always said that you were a bear. 

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.600
What a bear! 

01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:04.315
