WEBVTT

01:05.400 --> 01:06.520
Morning, James.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.720
Good morning!

01:17.680 --> 01:19.960
DOG BARKING

01:33.880 --> 01:35.480
How is it possible?

01:35.480 --> 01:38.280
We have nothing we want and two of
everything we don't.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.280
It's almost as if you might benefit
from employing some sort of system.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.680
Sarcasm really doesn't suit a woman
of your religiosity, Mrs Hall.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.520
DOOR OPENS, CLOSES

01:47.520 --> 01:48.680
Herriot!

01:48.680 --> 01:51.440
Well, you seem in a cheery mood
this morning.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.640
Herriot.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.920
Care to explain yourself?

01:54.920 --> 01:57.080
Yes, absolutely.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
I'm sorry.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.640
Sorry, what have I done?

02:00.640 --> 02:01.840
This. This.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.080
It's empty.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.280
What on earth is it doing back on
the shelf?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.880
Add Handshaw to the list,
he's got a cow down.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.840
I'll see to it.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.160
And when you're done pick my brother
up from the station,

02:18.160 --> 02:19.760
he should be on the 4.30.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.920
I didn't know Tristan were coming.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.320
There's another Farnon?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.520
I was perfectly clear with both of
you yesterday.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.560
And James,

02:27.560 --> 02:28.600
take the Rover.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.120
Thank you.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.400
The Rover?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.920
Quite the honour.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.600
One must offer the carrot as well
as the stick, Mrs Hall.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.160
And if it makes Tristan green
with envy, all the better.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.800
Motivation to apply himself
as Herriot has done.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.360
CAR DOOR SHUTS

03:56.920 --> 03:59.400
No Siegfried today?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.880
Unless he's hiding in the back.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.600
No, no, just me, I'm afraid.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.720
Who's this, then?

04:07.720 --> 04:09.880
Siegfried's new assistant.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.200
Oh, aye?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.880
Yes, another one.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.360
Cow's in t'shed.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.920
She hasn't stood for three days.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.400
I think it's milk fever keeping
her down.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.280
A bottle of calcium should solve
the problem.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.160
My dad always used to say
they had a worm in t'tail

04:32.160 --> 04:34.600
when they stayed down like this.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.440
Well, cutting it off'll see her up.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.400
Aside from being rather painful,

04:38.400 --> 04:41.440
I'm not sure how that would rectify
a deficiency of calcium.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.920
Oh, hark at him, only been born
five minutes,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.320
he knows stock better
than thee or I.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.480
Old ways is the old ways
for a reason, lad.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.000
These modern ways have their
merits, too.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.600
Broughton, this is Broughton.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.360
Oi!

05:42.360 --> 05:43.440
Oi! Tristan Farnon?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.480
Whatever you heard, it's not true.
I didn't do it.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.600
No, Siegfried sent me.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.800
I'm James Herriot,
his new assistant.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.320
Really? Poor you.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.840
Oi! You need to buy a ticket, Sir.

05:51.840 --> 05:52.920
Come on.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.720
Car? Where's the...?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.000
He let you drive the Rover?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.400
Yes, it's quite something,
isn't it?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.680
Wait a minute.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.680
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.520
Hurry up.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.000
Do you have a girl?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.600
Not as such. No.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.200
Not as such meaning not at all,
or not as such meaning yes,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.480
but not so much
that you're willing to say?

06:29.480 --> 06:31.640
Er... It's the former, isn't it?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.360
Never mind,
we'll soon sort that out.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.520
We will?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.120
Any local beauties taken your fancy?

06:36.120 --> 06:37.720
I've not been here too long.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.080
Ah, that explains it, then.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.400
Have you travelled far?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.920
Edinburgh. I've been at
veterinary college.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.240
Training to be a vet?

06:45.240 --> 06:47.080
No, electrician.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.240
Yes, of course, to be a vet.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.880
In between having an enormous amount
of fun at any rate.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.480
How do you find him?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.080
My brother, I mean.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.600
Everyone speaks very highly of him.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.400
Obviously he's an experienced vet.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.800
I sense a but.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.280
He's not without
his inconsistencies.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.800
Inconsistencies?

07:03.800 --> 07:04.920
The man's a lunatic.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.120
Why do you think he goes through
Mayflies like he does?

07:07.120 --> 07:08.440
Mayflies?

07:08.440 --> 07:09.840
It's what I call his assistants.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.480
They rarely last beyond the day.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.240
Will you be staying long
at Skeldale?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.440
Naturally.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.080
Someone's got to keep the family
business ticking over.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.120
Look out!

07:36.600 --> 07:37.720
Blimey.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.520
You know, I think we might've
got away with it.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.200
Fret not, Jim. It'll hold.

08:04.400 --> 08:10.080
Mrs H, you look more youthful
and radiant with each passing day.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.120
Ooh, I can feel your ribs
poking through.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.520
You're wasting away.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.880
It's the quality of the cooking,

08:15.880 --> 08:18.800
it just can't compare with the
culinary delights I get at home.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.720
I'm short of time but I managed
to rustle you up a bit of tea.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.800
You've outdone yourself, Mrs H.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.080
If only I had some ale
to wash it down with.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.520
I've some in the pantry.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.800
Evening, Siegfried.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.400
Good journey?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.480
Uneventful.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.400
Wasn't it, James?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.800
Barely a soul on the road.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.880
How was college?

08:56.880 --> 08:57.920
Oh, you know.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.080
Hard work.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.280
Nose to the grind stone.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.520
Celebrating last night?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.560
End of exams.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.720
And?

09:07.720 --> 09:10.200
All finished.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.760
Finished?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.560
Just passed the last one.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.760
You passed?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.800
Mm-hm. Oh, thank the Lord.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.120
Tristan, congratulations.
Good heavens.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.720
About bloody time, too.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.480
But don't think that means you
get to just sit around idle.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.720
I think what your brother means
to say is that he's very proud.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.520
What? Yes, yes, goes without saying.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.840
Very good. Very good.
Well done, very proud.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.120
What's happened to my room?

09:42.120 --> 09:45.240
I'm afraid we didn't know for
certain when you were coming back.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.600
Or was it more that you didn't know
how long he'd be staying?

09:48.600 --> 09:50.640
Oh, it's Mr Herriot's for now.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.840
I think you'll be quite
comfortable in here.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.840
The cupboard?

09:56.840 --> 09:59.080
I'll leave you boys
to get better acquainted.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.240
You should have your bed back.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.040
No, no, I won't hear of it.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.800
This'll be more
than sufficient for now.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.920
You know I don't plan
on leaving any time soon.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.720
No-one ever does.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.160
That's the thing about Siegfried,

10:15.160 --> 10:18.120
you never know what he's going
to do until he does it.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.040
In truth, neither does he.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.280
Sleep well.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.360
Morning, James.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.240
Morning.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.560
Afternoon, Jim.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.120
Siegfried, here's a list of
everything we're short of

11:09.120 --> 11:11.640
and this is the surplus.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.320
You did all this?
First thing this morning.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.480
You see, Herriot,
the early bird catches the worm.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.520
Well, put these in the car, I'll
run them over to Pandhi later.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.360
Mrs Pumphrey called a moment ago.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.600
Please tell me it's not.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.680
Flop-bott.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.040
Flop what? Bott.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.440
She treats that dog like
the Raja of bloody India.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.400
I tell you, she'll be the ruination
of the poor animal.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.440
Excuse me.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.000
Oh, and we had a call from Handshaw
while you were still asleep.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.240
Something about a cow
that wouldn't get up.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.600
Spitting chips about it, he was.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.640
I thought you dealt with that.
I did. His cow had milk fever.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.920
What she needs is
a bottle of calcium.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.400
Which I administered yesterday.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.600
Really, Herriot, you can't
keep going back and forth

12:03.600 --> 12:05.240
on the same case.
It's a waste of time.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.080
I'll head up there first thing
this morning.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.360
Tristan'll go with you.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.400
I will?

12:09.400 --> 12:12.880
Time to put theory into practice,
little brother.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.000
I'm sure James doesn't want another
Farnon breathing down his neck.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.480
Nonsense. Herriot doesn't mind.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.760
Not at all.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.560
Good. It's settled, then.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Time to see you at work, Jim.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.840
Go. Keep going, keep going.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.800
You're the one who let me
drive the car.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.560
Well, if I'd known you were coming
back, I'd have baked some fresh.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.360
Oh, God, it's good, Sylvie.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
If you weren't married already.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.000
'Fraid that's the last slice.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.760
Oh, well. He can share mine.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.160
I'm a little busy, actually.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.680
Suit yourself.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.120
The calcium should've
taken effect by now,

13:42.120 --> 13:44.000
so I'm going to try a
stimulant injection

13:44.000 --> 13:46.320
to give her a little encouragement.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.520
It might take a few hours
to take effect,

13:48.520 --> 13:50.400
but you should see her up
by this evening.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.320
That's what he said last time.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.640
My dad always had ways
of getting a cow up.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.280
Oh, well, let's hear some of them.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.720
I think we can manage.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.720
How about some water
in the lug hole?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.080
It'd certainly get me up.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.280
We're not pouring water
in her lug hole.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.000
Try yelling at her?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.720
I'm not going to shout at a cow.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.040
I'll give it a go, if you like.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.240
Hey, I always said
he were a grand lad.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.040
No, no, no, I'll... I'll do it.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.200
What exactly am I supposed to yell?

14:21.840 --> 14:27.320
Well, when I wants to move a cow,
I always says "cush".

14:27.320 --> 14:28.440
Aye.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.680
They understand cush.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.400
Cush.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.160
Cush.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.760
Cush!

14:56.400 --> 14:58.720
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

14:58.720 --> 15:01.680
It just tickled me, I've never seen
a man shout at a cow before.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.360
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.560
If you can't enjoy yourself
then what's the point?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.240
And the Handshaws certainly
appreciated it.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.640
As my brother always says, you treat
the person, not just the animal.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.000
Oh, cush.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.920
Audrey.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.360
Reporting for duty, ma'am.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.120
Give over.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.680
I lost the stripes years ago.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.240
Oh, it's good to see you.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.120
Yeah, you too. You too.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.280
Hello, need a lift?

15:41.280 --> 15:42.920
Oh, we're only going to
the tea room.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.880
Who's this, then? New fancy man?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.600
Hm? Oh, no.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.240
Mr Farnon owns the veterinary
practice I keep house for.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.880
This is Dorothy.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.080
How do you do?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.720
I understand you served under
Mrs Hall in the Wrens.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.880
Brutal task master she was, too.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.440
I can certainly attest to that.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.080
Is that yours?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.280
For now.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.160
I'm leaving sunny
Scarborough for Malta

16:06.160 --> 16:07.720
Trying to get rid
of it before I go.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.120
Her son's out with the Navy.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.760
If you're interested, I'm around
these parts the next few weeks

16:11.760 --> 16:13.920
catching up with friends.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.520
Thank you.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.800
Pleasure to meet you.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.440
Until this evening.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.160
Oh, lovely lines.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.760
The Rover.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.240
You know I've always had
a soft spot for a soft top.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.000
So, how are things at home?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.520
Scarborough still the rogues'
gallery it's always been?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.680
Oh, you know, as ever it was.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.800
Have you seen my
Edward knocking about?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.960
Let's talk about it over a brew.

16:45.960 --> 16:46.920
Come on.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.560
Blimey.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.120
Quite something, isn't it?

17:01.120 --> 17:04.200
Her old man's mills used to weave
half the cloth in the county.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.680
This way, gentlemen.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.800
Do show the band where to set up.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.280
Ah, thank you, Francois.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.440
Make sure we have plenty of ice.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.800
The doctor said I must drink
more water.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.840
Eugh!

17:46.840 --> 17:47.880
Mrs Pumphrey.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.880
Looks like you're putting
on quite the shindig.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.520
Oh, just a modest affair
for our closest friends.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.040
Isn't that right, Tricki?

17:54.040 --> 17:56.280
And how've you been little man?
GROWLING

17:56.280 --> 18:00.200
Oh, dear, I think he remembers you.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.360
He stood on his tail.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.600
Accidentally, I hasten to add.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.880
Yes, but he does bear grudges.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.920
And who is this delight?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.960
James Herriot.
Mr Farnon's new assistant.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.280
It's true what I've been hearing.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.280
You are a handsome devil.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.200
And you must be Tricki-Woo.
TRICKI GROWLS

18:23.200 --> 18:26.480
That's no way to greet Mr Herriot.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.560
Paw.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.080
Honestly.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.880
You'd think he'd been dragged up.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.280
Isn't he just adorable?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.480
Paw, Tricki?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.520
Paw.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.960
Let us take him to the library
for his treatment.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.880
We must preserve his dignity.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.840
Be glad to take it off your hands.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.880
Always happy to help a man
who's struggling.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.240
Oh, we're far from struggling - no,
we just need to make some space

18:56.240 --> 18:58.160
so we stock for the more
profitable work.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.760
Clinton.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.920
Careful with that.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.880
There's some wimpy looking devils
coming into this profession.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.080
Now, now, George, we can't
all be as handsome as you.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.120
Blasted students.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.760
Not worth a penny I pay them.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.400
Student? Oh, well, you manage with
what you can find, I suppose.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.920
I've two assistants now.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.960
Is that so?

19:15.960 --> 19:17.160
Both fully qualified.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.360
Yes, my brother just passed
his exams,

19:19.360 --> 19:22.640
which means we'll be able to
take on even more work.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.920
Onwards and upwards, eh, George?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.200
Onwards and upwards.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.680
Impacted anal glands.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.640
Now that we've expressed them,
he should feel more comfortable.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.240
I don't know why this
keeps happening,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.760
I only feed him the very best food.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.200
Ah, well, that could
be part of the problem,

19:41.200 --> 19:42.920
what exactly is it you're
feeding him?

19:42.920 --> 19:46.920
Oh, the usual - chicken,
beef Wellington, plum duff,

19:46.920 --> 19:49.560
and he absolutely adores trifle.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.880
Who doesn't? Good boy.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.080
TRICKI BARKS, GROWLS

19:52.080 --> 19:53.560
And cake, of course.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.240
Ah, well, there you have it.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.280
Triple pud always puts my
insides in a rum old state.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.840
Too much rich food in his diet.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.240
Not enough fibre.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.520
Yeah, that too. If you want to get
technical about it.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.160
Brown meat and biscuits twice a day.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.480
That's all he should be having.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.160
Quite right. Well said, Jim.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.880
Oh, Tricki, Uncle Herriot's
telling mummy off.

20:13.080 --> 20:18.760
Uncle...Herriot is simply trying
to make sure his nephew stays fit

20:18.760 --> 20:20.000
and healthy.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.160
But how will my poor baby survive?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.080
Very well, I should imagine.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.400
Let's face it, there's enough meat
on the bone.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.720
Excuse me?

20:28.720 --> 20:32.440
I just mean he's carrying a little
extra timber around the middle.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.560
That's all.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.240
Don't listen to him, Tricki.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.800
You're perfect as you are.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.280
I'm sorry, Tricki, I didn't mean it.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.280
Oh.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.840
Well, there goes my invite.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.000
Damn dog.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.880
Just one more stop
before we head home.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.080
All right there, Tris?
Didn't know you were back.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.000
I assume you've missed me terribly.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.360
Oh, I don't know how I've coped.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.280
James! I barely recognise
you with your clothes on.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.440
Wait? What?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.280
I was swimming. It's nothing.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.360
Your old horse and cart's
had a bit of an upgrade.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.200
Borrowed it from the Hultons.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.480
Hop on up, calf's in the top field.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.160
Can I have a go? I've always
wanted to drive a tractor.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.040
I wouldn't.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.400
I won't.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.960
Lovely view.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.000
Isn't it?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.200
That's Heskit Fell.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.000
Eddleton just beyond.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.920
Wedder over the other side.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.640
Colver and Sennor.

22:01.680 --> 22:05.080
You talk about them as if they were
old friends.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.880
I've known them my whole life.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.680
There's a river up there that's good
for swimming.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.760
Here she is.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.840
Seems to be putting weight
on it all right.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.000
Well, that was easy enough.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.400
What's say we round off the day
with a pint at the Drovers?

22:33.400 --> 22:36.040
I'd like to take a closer look,

22:36.040 --> 22:37.080
just to make sure.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.120
Of course he would.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.760
How was your first day on the job?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.320
Very instructive.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.040
Jim has his own particular methods.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.720
BELL RINGS

22:59.720 --> 23:00.840
I've got it.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.000
What about Handshaw's cow?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.120
That all taken care of?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.840
Absolutely. Eventually.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.560
Is it or isn't it? I don't want to
have to go up there myself.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.760
All it needed was an extra
stimulant injection.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.360
I assure you, Siegfried,
it's all sorted.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.320
I'm pleased to hear it.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.840
That were Mrs Pumphrey's driver.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.440
A letter for Uncle Herriot.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.880
"Tricki-Woo requests the pleasure
of Uncle Herriot's company

23:24.880 --> 23:27.200
"for drinks and dancing."
He's going to the party?

23:27.200 --> 23:30.000
Invited by Tricki-Woo, no less.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.160
You will be the guest of honour.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.440
I'll just get supper out the oven.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.360
You must've made quite
the impression.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.400
Do you think I should go?

23:37.400 --> 23:38.440
Oh, course you should.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.120
Rivers of champagne,
mountains of food.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.720
Annoying Pekinese barking
shrilly in your ear.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.360
Ah, it says here it's white tie.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.960
Oh, well, if you haven't got it,

23:45.960 --> 23:48.320
I'm sure Tristan has
something you can borrow.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.080
Tris?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.880
We're not quite the same size.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.520
But I suppose you could try
and squeeze into it.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.200
Mrs Hall does wonders
with a needle and thread.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.240
I'm sure it won't be a problem...
WHISPERS: ..taking it in.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.080
PHONE RINGS

24:11.400 --> 24:13.440
Darrowby, 2297.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.040
Mr Handshaw, how can I...

24:16.680 --> 24:18.320
I see.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.560
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.080
No, no, I understand.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.280
I'll be up first thing
tomorrow morning.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.360
Anything important?

24:29.360 --> 24:30.800
No. Nothing to worry about.

24:50.559 --> 24:52.519
Isn't this Handshaw's place?

24:52.519 --> 24:53.759
Why are we back here?

25:03.119 --> 25:04.439
You old devil.

25:04.439 --> 25:07.479
I distinctly recall you telling
Siegfried it was all sorted.

25:07.479 --> 25:09.159
It is.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.239
It will be.

25:10.239 --> 25:11.439
Never fear, Jim.

25:11.439 --> 25:12.959
Your secret's safe with me.

25:22.839 --> 25:25.519
Let's see if these sacks
can't lift her up.

25:25.519 --> 25:27.199
Try to rock her over towards me.

25:31.959 --> 25:34.599
Tristan? Are you perfectly
comfortable over there?

25:34.599 --> 25:38.559
I'm probably best employed in more
of an overseeing capacity.

25:38.559 --> 25:41.079
What about carbolic
in a pint of beer?

25:41.079 --> 25:43.919
Would that be for us or the cow?

25:43.919 --> 25:45.199
We just need to lift.

25:45.199 --> 25:47.159
OK, I need everyone to lift.

25:50.559 --> 25:52.439
Lift.

25:52.439 --> 25:53.479
Lift!

26:01.199 --> 26:02.639
We'll try again.

26:02.639 --> 26:04.839
Tristan, we could really do
with your help.

26:16.279 --> 26:19.079
One, two, three.

26:19.079 --> 26:21.239
Everyone shout cush!

26:21.239 --> 26:23.959
ALL: Cush!

26:23.959 --> 26:25.239
Cush!

26:26.919 --> 26:29.319
Cush!

26:29.319 --> 26:30.799
Cush!

26:30.799 --> 26:32.279
Wait. Stop!

26:32.279 --> 26:35.079
Cush! Will everyone please be quiet?

26:35.079 --> 26:36.119
Shut up!

26:46.159 --> 26:48.319
GENTLE CRUNCHING

27:15.639 --> 27:19.119
Mrs Hall, have you been baking
that shortbread I like?

27:19.119 --> 27:20.479
I've a couple spare.

27:21.479 --> 27:22.519
What's this?

27:24.359 --> 27:26.959
Dorothy said he'd been
staying there.

27:28.759 --> 27:31.679
He's still my boy, no matter
what he may've done.

27:31.679 --> 27:33.919
I'll take it to the post office for
you, if you like.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.119
You don't have to.

27:35.119 --> 27:36.999
And if you need anything else -

27:36.999 --> 27:38.479
anything at all -

27:38.479 --> 27:39.519
just ask.

27:41.679 --> 27:44.279
Set yourself down,
I'll fetch some tea.

27:55.439 --> 27:58.519
Tristan seems to have
turned over a new leaf.

28:00.199 --> 28:05.439
In fact, I'd say he's turned over
a whole garden of them.

28:05.439 --> 28:06.679
It's early days yet.

28:06.679 --> 28:10.439
But I must admit it feels
like a weight's been lifted.

28:11.479 --> 28:13.239
What weight might that be?

28:14.559 --> 28:16.999
A son's promise to his dying father.

28:20.159 --> 28:22.399
You're lucky to have him so close.

28:24.639 --> 28:27.639
Why is it the ones we love most
cause the most pain?

28:30.919 --> 28:33.519
Sorry, Mrs Hall, would you mind
passing me the milk?

28:48.039 --> 28:52.279
I've got hold of the pelvic girdle,
listen as I move it.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.159
GENTLE CRUNCHING

28:59.199 --> 29:00.719
I barely heard nowt.

29:00.719 --> 29:02.879
The bones are moving.

29:02.879 --> 29:05.279
I'm afraid the pelvis is broken.

29:05.279 --> 29:06.999
What's all this now?

29:06.999 --> 29:08.759
You said it were milk fever.

29:08.759 --> 29:09.999
It was.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.039
It is.

29:11.039 --> 29:13.359
Then what're you on about
its pelvis being broken?

29:13.359 --> 29:15.959
Tristan, he's talking
a whole lot of rot, isn't he?

29:15.959 --> 29:18.559
You're welcome to carry out
your own examination.

29:18.559 --> 29:21.319
Oh, no, I'm not getting my
fingers burnt on this one.

29:21.319 --> 29:24.279
So if its pelvis is broken,
what're you going to do about it?

29:24.279 --> 29:27.399
I'm afraid she's got no strength
left in her hind legs.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.679
The only thing you can do is get
her off to the butchers.

29:29.679 --> 29:31.439
Tosh.

29:31.439 --> 29:33.759
We'll see her right.

29:33.759 --> 29:36.559
All she needs is
a sheepskin on the back.

29:36.559 --> 29:38.759
It won't make the blindest
bit of difference.

29:40.319 --> 29:42.519
There's nothing more
that can be done.

29:46.279 --> 29:47.639
I'm sorry.

30:00.879 --> 30:02.839
I need 25 pounds for it.

30:02.839 --> 30:04.399
I'm sure that's what you want.

30:04.399 --> 30:07.199
But wants and needs are
two very different things.

30:07.199 --> 30:08.639
Mind starting her up?

30:13.919 --> 30:16.079
ENGINE REVS

30:16.079 --> 30:17.759
Running a little rough.

30:19.039 --> 30:20.839
Know much about cars, then?

30:22.079 --> 30:24.359
I'll give you 18.

30:24.359 --> 30:25.399
20.

30:25.399 --> 30:26.439
18.

30:26.439 --> 30:27.799
20 with conditions.

30:27.799 --> 30:28.839
What conditions?

30:28.839 --> 30:30.399
One condition.

30:30.399 --> 30:33.559
Audrey has a big heart,
she opens it up to everyone.

30:33.559 --> 30:36.319
Even those that don't always
deserve it.

30:36.319 --> 30:38.159
Her son?

30:38.159 --> 30:39.559
Edward.

30:39.559 --> 30:42.559
He'll break her heart again
and again but she'll never learn.

30:42.559 --> 30:44.159
Look out for her for me?

30:47.559 --> 30:49.879
And you'll take 25?

30:54.799 --> 30:56.599
Oh, he's here.

30:56.599 --> 30:59.159
Mrs H, if that tastes half
as good as it smells,

30:59.159 --> 31:01.159
Pumphrey can keep her stupid party.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.199
They're back.

31:04.879 --> 31:06.479
Tristan?

31:06.479 --> 31:07.839
What have I done?

31:07.839 --> 31:08.959
Come with me.

31:08.959 --> 31:11.279
I'm afraid we've had a slight issue
with Handshaw's cow.

31:11.279 --> 31:13.479
Never mind about that.
Everyone outside. Quickly.

31:13.479 --> 31:14.879
Come on. Hurry up.

31:14.879 --> 31:16.319
This is more important.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.399
What do you think?

31:22.399 --> 31:23.679
It's a car. What of it?

31:23.679 --> 31:24.799
Not just any car.

31:24.799 --> 31:25.839
It's yours.

31:25.839 --> 31:27.079
Sorry. I was coming to that.

31:27.079 --> 31:28.719
I couldn't keep it in any longer.

31:32.279 --> 31:33.799
You've bought me a car?

31:33.799 --> 31:36.399
It just about qualifies as one.

31:36.399 --> 31:40.199
I felt perhaps you deserved one,
after all your hard work.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.399
And now you've qualified,

31:41.399 --> 31:44.199
we'll be wanting to send you out
on your own eventually.

31:46.199 --> 31:47.919
I don't know what to say.

31:47.919 --> 31:49.919
Don't say anything,
just get in the damn thing.

31:49.919 --> 31:51.279
Give the boy a chance.

31:51.279 --> 31:53.959
Go on Tris, before he
pops a blood vessel.

32:03.039 --> 32:05.759
You shouldn't've done this,
Siegfried. It's too much.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.239
I should.

32:07.239 --> 32:11.759
I'll never forget the day
Father gave me my first car.

32:11.759 --> 32:14.719
It struck me that's a memory you
never got to share with him.

32:16.439 --> 32:17.719
Anyway.

32:17.719 --> 32:20.159
We've got a party to be
preparing for.

32:20.159 --> 32:22.759
Come on, James, those debs
won't dance themselves.

32:40.199 --> 32:41.479
There you are.

32:41.479 --> 32:42.599
Where's your jacket?

32:42.599 --> 32:44.759
Just finishing up now.

32:44.759 --> 32:46.039
Here you go, James.

32:46.039 --> 32:47.079
Thank you.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.119
I tell you what, Tris...

32:51.279 --> 32:54.279
..when I get back, you and I will
crack open a bottle of my finest,

32:54.279 --> 32:56.439
sit up and put the world to rights.

32:56.439 --> 32:57.879
How does that sound?

32:59.199 --> 33:00.439
I'd like that.

33:00.439 --> 33:03.079
But don't go thinking you can help
yourself to any while I'm away.

33:03.079 --> 33:04.279
If you do, I shall know.

33:05.719 --> 33:06.759
Goodbye.

33:09.199 --> 33:11.039
Thanks again for the suit, Tristan.

33:25.999 --> 33:27.639
Now, then, James.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.079
Good evening.

33:29.079 --> 33:31.959
So, at times like these, James,

33:31.959 --> 33:35.359
frankly, we should
take what we can get.

33:35.359 --> 33:37.519
So, if I were you,

33:37.519 --> 33:39.879
say yes to everything
you're offered.

33:39.879 --> 33:41.279
The food shouldn't run out,

33:41.279 --> 33:42.639
nor should the drink

33:42.639 --> 33:47.279
and you certainly won't run
out of people to dance with.

33:47.279 --> 33:49.639
The state of that thing,
it's unnatural.

33:49.639 --> 33:52.839
He'll have a bloody coronary
at this rate.

33:52.839 --> 33:54.519
PUMPHREY: Siegfried, James.

33:54.519 --> 33:56.119
So glad you could come.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.439
A pleasure as always.

33:57.439 --> 33:59.639
And look at this
delightful little man.

33:59.639 --> 34:01.799
Look, it's Uncle Herriot.

34:01.799 --> 34:04.239
He's been so looking
forward to seeing you.

34:04.239 --> 34:06.399
Is that trifle I see in his bowl?

34:06.399 --> 34:09.639
I know it's naughty but it's
the only way to keep him happy.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.279
He finds these occasions
rather testing.

34:13.279 --> 34:18.119
Thank goodness he has you
to keep him company.

34:18.119 --> 34:19.599
Thank goodness indeed.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.839
Francois. Francois.

34:21.839 --> 34:24.759
This is Tricki's guest,
Uncle Herriot.

34:24.759 --> 34:27.719
Make certain his glass never
runs dry.

34:27.719 --> 34:34.239
As for you, there are ladies in
there in need of entertainment.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.039
Then let us begin with my
absolute favourite.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.039
Good evening, Miss Alderson.

34:52.039 --> 34:53.199
Hiya.

35:28.199 --> 35:29.799
Paws off.

35:29.799 --> 35:31.839
This is Uncle Herriot's.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.199
I didn't know you were related.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.439
We're not.

35:34.439 --> 35:36.079
That's just what he calls me.

35:36.079 --> 35:38.519
I mean, what Mrs Pumphrey
calls me on his behalf.

35:40.439 --> 35:44.079
Auntie Alderson, I have
been since he was a pup.

35:44.079 --> 35:45.999
Has he always been a porker?

35:45.999 --> 35:49.359
You wouldn't believe the things
I've seen this chap put away.

35:49.359 --> 35:51.919
Right, I don't suppose
you know what this is?

35:51.919 --> 35:53.679
Caviar, I'd guess.

35:53.679 --> 35:56.079
If I were you,
I'd give it to the dog.

35:59.639 --> 36:02.159
He's on his fifth already.

36:02.159 --> 36:04.679
He'll dance with five more before
the end of the night.

36:04.679 --> 36:06.359
But never more than once.

36:06.359 --> 36:08.039
MUSIC ENDS

36:16.999 --> 36:19.479
George. You look like you've
been enjoying yourself.

36:19.479 --> 36:21.239
Oh, haven't I just.

36:22.679 --> 36:25.239
I heard one of your
qualified assistants

36:25.239 --> 36:29.159
tried to send a perfectly
good cow to the butchers.

36:29.159 --> 36:32.159
What the devil are you
talking about?

36:32.159 --> 36:35.159
I try to take Jess for a run
that way most mornings.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.439
Well, in future,
I'll bear that in mind.

36:37.439 --> 36:39.799
I'm sorry if you saw more
than you bargained for.

36:39.799 --> 36:41.559
I didn't think there was
anyone around.

36:41.559 --> 36:42.959
No need to apologise.

36:42.959 --> 36:46.319
If you hadn't got there first,
I was going to do the same thing.

36:46.319 --> 36:49.399
I find it sets me up for the day,
makes me feel so...

36:49.399 --> 36:50.799
Alive?

36:50.799 --> 36:52.119
Aye. That's it.

36:52.119 --> 36:53.919
Alive.

36:53.919 --> 36:57.319
Up in the Dales,
surrounded by those hills,

36:57.319 --> 36:58.879
there's no place on Earth like it.

36:58.879 --> 37:02.439
Careful. Once it gets in your bones,
it's hard to get out.

37:02.439 --> 37:03.879
I'm not sure I want it to.

37:03.879 --> 37:04.919
Good.

37:10.199 --> 37:12.399
I was wondering, I
hope you don't mind me,

37:12.399 --> 37:13.999
but could I see you some time?

37:15.359 --> 37:18.999
I mean, I know I can see you -
you're right in front of me.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.479
I'm sorry, I shouldn't've...

37:20.479 --> 37:21.759
It's not that, it's just...

37:21.759 --> 37:23.279
This is where you're hiding.

37:23.279 --> 37:24.399
I wasn't hiding.

37:24.399 --> 37:25.719
No, I know.

37:26.759 --> 37:27.839
Who's this?

37:27.839 --> 37:28.879
James Herriot.

37:28.879 --> 37:30.159
Siegfried's new assistant.

37:30.159 --> 37:32.439
Oh. Hugh Hulton, pleasure.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.119
Was I interrupting?

37:37.119 --> 37:38.759
No, not really.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.919
Well, we were just catching up.

37:40.919 --> 37:41.959
Shall we dance?

37:41.959 --> 37:42.999
Yes.

37:46.359 --> 37:48.719
I think so, Francois, don't you?

37:51.119 --> 37:53.999
You and I are going for a
little drive.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.559
Excuse me.

37:55.559 --> 37:56.599
Excuse me.

37:56.599 --> 37:57.639
Thank you.

37:57.639 --> 37:58.679
Excuse me.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.199
Six runs,

38:08.199 --> 38:11.239
taking you to 22-2.

38:14.759 --> 38:18.799
Oh, Bradman scores a towering
six over mid-wicket.

38:18.799 --> 38:23.279
The Australians celebrate wildly
and perhaps a little uncouthly

38:23.279 --> 38:24.959
but that's often their way.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.439
Not enjoying yourself?

38:30.679 --> 38:31.719
Talk about it?

38:41.199 --> 38:42.719
Ooh, an appeal.

38:42.719 --> 38:44.679
Is he out? Or has he survived?

38:46.719 --> 38:47.759
Caught.

38:49.199 --> 38:50.719
He's caught out.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.239
Aren't you?

38:57.599 --> 38:58.839
How did you know?

38:58.839 --> 39:01.759
It were in the pocket of
your jacket, you daft beggar.

39:03.039 --> 39:04.079
I'm sorry...

39:04.079 --> 39:05.119
Why did you lie?

39:07.159 --> 39:10.119
I didn't lie, technically speaking.

39:10.119 --> 39:12.479
You told him you passed your
last exam.

39:12.479 --> 39:13.559
Which is true.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.399
I did pass my last exam.

39:17.319 --> 39:20.919
I just omitted the fact that I
failed the two that proceeded it.

39:20.919 --> 39:22.359
You silly boy.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.159
You silly, silly boy.

39:24.159 --> 39:25.999
I didn't know he was going
to buy me a car.

39:25.999 --> 39:27.959
What did you think
was going to happen?

39:27.959 --> 39:28.999
I didn't.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.319
What?

39:30.319 --> 39:31.359
Think.

39:32.599 --> 39:35.319
I just couldn't bear
the thought of failing again.

39:36.799 --> 39:38.439
It's hard, isn't it, love?

39:40.799 --> 39:42.079
I'm sorry.

39:45.479 --> 39:46.959
He's going to kill me.

39:46.959 --> 39:48.079
Don't be silly.

39:49.079 --> 39:50.279
He might maim you.

39:53.239 --> 39:55.479
He's your brother,

39:55.479 --> 39:58.719
he'll never stop caring for you,

39:58.719 --> 40:00.039
no matter what you do.

40:04.559 --> 40:06.839
But it can't go on.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.519
He needs to know the truth.

40:11.639 --> 40:12.919
SHE ROLLS DICE

40:14.359 --> 40:15.799
Oh.

40:19.559 --> 40:21.719
I don't understand.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.959
All she needed were
t'sheepskin on her back.

40:23.959 --> 40:25.559
But I felt the bone moving.

40:25.559 --> 40:26.839
The pelvis was broken.

40:26.839 --> 40:28.799
Feels solid enough now.

40:28.799 --> 40:30.359
Tell me, how long ago did she calf?

40:30.359 --> 40:31.599
Three day ago.

40:31.599 --> 40:32.919
There you are, then.

40:32.919 --> 40:35.639
The ligaments hadn't tightened up
again following the birth.

40:35.639 --> 40:37.799
A rudimentary error, Herriot.

40:38.839 --> 40:40.999
We calls her Lazarus now.

40:47.439 --> 40:48.799
DOOR CLOSES

40:50.599 --> 40:53.279
Let's hope the party's put him
in a good mood.

40:53.279 --> 40:54.399
Good party?

40:54.399 --> 40:55.639
Bloody disaster.

40:55.639 --> 40:57.799
Tell them, Herriot.

40:57.799 --> 40:59.279
I made a mistake.

40:59.279 --> 41:01.679
He made a complete hash
of treating Handshaw's cow -

41:01.679 --> 41:05.119
something which Pandhi took great
delight in pointing out.

41:05.119 --> 41:07.359
Honestly, James, I'm beginning to
wonder if perhaps

41:07.359 --> 41:09.559
you oughtn't be the one learning
from Tristan.

41:09.559 --> 41:10.879
Wouldn't be so sure about that.

41:10.879 --> 41:12.839
Don't be modest. It's terribly dull.

41:12.839 --> 41:14.599
Here, it's nearly as old as you are.

41:14.599 --> 41:15.799
Cheers.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.479
What?

41:18.479 --> 41:20.319
What is it?

41:20.319 --> 41:23.639
I think perhaps James and I
should retire.

41:23.639 --> 41:24.759
Hm?

41:24.759 --> 41:25.919
Righto.

41:30.759 --> 41:31.879
Little brother?

41:33.599 --> 41:36.919
I suggest we retreat
to a safe distance.

41:36.919 --> 41:38.679
If such a thing exists.

41:45.759 --> 41:47.959
Siegfried?

41:47.959 --> 41:48.999
Say something.

41:52.759 --> 41:53.959
You failed?

41:55.479 --> 41:58.159
Failed is a bit strong,
I just didn't quite pass.

41:58.159 --> 41:59.199
You failed.

42:02.039 --> 42:03.239
I'm sorry, I just...

42:03.239 --> 42:05.759
What the hell have you been
doing all this term?

42:05.759 --> 42:10.319
Boozing, I shouldn't wonder.
Chasing women, spending my money.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.079
Anything but work, I should think.

42:13.919 --> 42:15.439
It's a damn disgrace!

42:20.799 --> 42:24.239
The worst of it is, I actually
started to think you might be

42:24.239 --> 42:25.279
changing your ways.

42:26.479 --> 42:28.199
I didn't try to fail...

42:28.199 --> 42:30.559
No, but you didn't try very hard
to pass either.

42:30.559 --> 42:31.959
And then you lied about it.

42:31.959 --> 42:33.879
Ah, now technically, I didn't lie...

42:33.879 --> 42:36.519
Technically?!
I bought you a bloody car!

42:36.519 --> 42:37.799
I was proud of you.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.599
I was proud of you.

42:52.279 --> 42:55.239
Where the devil do you
think you're going?

42:55.239 --> 42:56.319
I thought we were done.

42:56.319 --> 42:58.519
We're done when
I damn well say we're done!

43:03.279 --> 43:04.519
All right, we're done!

43:19.319 --> 43:22.319
SHE COUNTS QUIETLY

43:25.599 --> 43:28.919
Mrs Hall, have you been moving my
things again?

43:28.919 --> 43:32.359
By moving, do you mean
tidying away your possessions

43:32.359 --> 43:34.799
that you leave scattered
without rhyme nor reason?

43:34.799 --> 43:36.079
Keys?

43:36.079 --> 43:38.559
On the hook in the hall.

43:38.559 --> 43:40.199
Where they live.

43:42.679 --> 43:45.879
Well, I certainly won't forget my
first car in a hurry.

43:45.879 --> 43:47.439
He'll forgive you, eventually.

43:47.439 --> 43:49.599
Yes, I'm sure he will.

43:49.599 --> 43:51.799
Then I have no doubt
he'll find something else

43:51.799 --> 43:53.119
to be cross with me about.

43:53.119 --> 43:54.599
I'm sure that goes for me too.

43:55.639 --> 43:58.559
The only way we'll survive my
brother is if we stick together.

44:01.359 --> 44:02.639
HEAVY CLATTER

44:02.639 --> 44:04.919
Tristan?

44:04.919 --> 44:05.959
Herriot?

44:05.959 --> 44:06.999
Run. Go!

44:08.679 --> 44:09.839
James?

44:12.879 --> 44:15.959
What the bloody hell
happened to my car?!

44:15.959 --> 44:17.399
Tristan!

44:17.399 --> 44:19.239
Herriot!

44:27.239 --> 44:32.159
