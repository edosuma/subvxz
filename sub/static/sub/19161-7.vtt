00:00.961 --> 00:02.170
<i>Previously on
Riverdale...</i>

00:02.379 --> 00:05.465
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:05.674 --> 00:08.510
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

00:08.718 --> 00:09.719
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

00:10.136 --> 00:12.180
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents

00:12.389 --> 00:14.391
<i>to decrease the value
of the drive-in's land.</i>

00:14.599 --> 00:15.725
- Where is the rest of it?
- The rest of it?

00:18.353 --> 00:20.355
- Where are you gonna live now?
- I'll figure it out, Dad.

00:20.563 --> 00:21.690
I always do.

00:22.107 --> 00:24.484
<i>I saw you, Mom.
With Fred Andrews.</i>

00:24.693 --> 00:26.987
Two signatures are needed
to award the contract.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.405
Sorry, Mom, but no.

00:28.613 --> 00:29.739
I don't want any part of it.

00:30.573 --> 00:31.574
What's going on?

00:31.741 --> 00:33.827
That SoDale contract? Awarded
to Andrew's Construction.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.203
Looks like you won.

00:35.412 --> 00:37.497
You're...
With Jason's...

00:37.706 --> 00:39.040
You just have to help me
get out of here.

00:39.249 --> 00:41.292
I'll go to the car
on the lost highway
off of Route 40.

00:41.501 --> 00:42.752
Is that Jason's jacket?

00:42.961 --> 00:44.671
We need to get Sheriff Keller
and then we need to get Polly.

00:49.009 --> 00:50.885
<i>What makes a
place feel like home</i>?

00:53.972 --> 00:55.932
<i>Is it warmth and familiarity?</i>

00:56.141 --> 01:00.478
<i>Some idealized,
make-believe TV version
of the American Dream?</i>

01:02.397 --> 01:04.107
<i>Is it love and acceptance?</i>

01:06.860 --> 01:08.278
<i>Or is it simple safety?</i>

01:33.428 --> 01:34.512
Dude.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.014
Why'd you stab me
in the back?

01:45.607 --> 01:48.234
<i>Or it's none of those things.</i>

01:48.443 --> 01:51.696
<i>And it's a place where
the captain of the
football team is murdered.</i>

01:52.447 --> 01:56.659
<i>Or maybe it's just
a forgotten closet
under a well-trod staircase,</i>

01:57.452 --> 02:01.122
<i>where it's just you
and the mice and the spiders,</i>

02:01.331 --> 02:03.958
<i>like an extra
in a Wes Craven movie.</i>

02:21.935 --> 02:23.394
- Oh!
- Whoa.

02:25.271 --> 02:26.606
What are you doing here?

02:27.774 --> 02:30.693
Taking advantage
of the school's
state-of-the-art facilities.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.739
No, really, Jughead.
What are you doing in here?

02:44.958 --> 02:46.209
How long?

02:46.417 --> 02:48.294
Well, since they shut down
the drive-in.

02:48.503 --> 02:49.921
That's where
I was living before.

02:50.130 --> 02:51.422
Why the hell are you
not living at home?

02:51.631 --> 02:54.551
The truth is,
things aren't good at home.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.302
- With your dad?
- Yeah.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.179
He kind of fell off the wagon.

02:58.805 --> 03:01.182
After your dad fired him,
to tell you the truth.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.642
Hasn't had a job since.

03:02.851 --> 03:04.853
He keeps promising
that he's gonna get
his act together,

03:05.061 --> 03:07.564
but my mom couldn't take
that rollercoaster anymore,

03:07.772 --> 03:11.734
so she grabbed Jellybean
and went to live
with our grandparents.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.945
Come on.

03:14.154 --> 03:15.989
God, Jug,
why didn't you tell me?

03:16.197 --> 03:17.490
And where does your dad
think you are?

03:17.699 --> 03:18.908
He thinks I'm couch-surfing.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.077
Well, screw that.
Live with me.

03:21.286 --> 03:23.538
This is temporary, man.

03:23.746 --> 03:24.914
I'm going to figure
something out.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.417
Just don't tell anybody.
Especially not Betty.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.170
Betty?
She's not gonna care.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.173
If anyone's gonna be
a snob about it,
maybe Veronica.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.634
Right, well, exactly.
Don't tell her, either.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.312
What's all this?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.439
Some retail therapy
to salve my emotional wounds,

03:49.647 --> 03:51.024
a few treasures
from Glamazon.com.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.984
Smithers, be a love
and put those in my room.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.572
Veronica, the nest egg
that your father left us

03:57.780 --> 03:59.699
barely covers the rent
of this apartment.

03:59.908 --> 04:01.534
We can't live
beyond our means.

04:01.743 --> 04:02.827
Are you sure, Mother?

04:03.036 --> 04:04.287
Not even with
your cushy new job

04:04.495 --> 04:05.955
working for your high-school
boyfriend?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.921
My mom and dad
don't want to get
the police involved.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.964
They don't want anyone
to know that she ran away,

04:15.173 --> 04:17.342
or about her
shameful condition.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.385
Please.
What decade is this?

04:19.594 --> 04:21.679
Also, since she knew
where Jason's getaway car was,

04:21.888 --> 04:25.642
they're afraid people
might think that she burned it
and that if she did...

04:25.850 --> 04:27.644
She could be the murderer,
trying to cover her tracks.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.270
Who did burn the car, then?

04:29.479 --> 04:32.023
Sheriff Keller
says it's possible
someone was following us.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.984
Oh, my God.
Honestly, guys,
we should just move.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.738
Guys, what if Polly's
really hurt?

04:38.947 --> 04:42.075
What if whoever killed Jason
is coming after her next?

04:48.248 --> 04:49.958
Betty, even though
your parents don't want to,

04:50.166 --> 04:51.668
maybe you should
go to the police.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.294
Second it. We can talk
to my dad together

04:53.503 --> 04:54.754
about how he has
to be discreet.

04:54.963 --> 04:56.965
No offense, Kev,
but your dad answers

04:57.173 --> 05:00.093
to a higher authority
than God, the Blossoms.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.719
They're the first people
that he would tell.

05:01.928 --> 05:03.888
And if there's anyone
to keep this a secret from,

05:04.097 --> 05:05.765
it's the Blossoms.

05:05.974 --> 05:09.352
They'd twist it around
and go after Polly
out of spite.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.770
How can we help?

05:10.979 --> 05:12.605
Tell us, B,
and we'll do it.

05:16.609 --> 05:17.902
Hey, Juggy.

05:18.111 --> 05:21.114
Remember before how you said
you didn't want Betty knowing
where you were living?

05:21.823 --> 05:23.950
Is that because
you and Betty...

05:25.451 --> 05:26.494
We may have had a moment...

05:26.703 --> 05:27.704
It's totally cool, I get it.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.289
No worries,
I'm just curious.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.794
Hey, I've been thinking
about your situation,
and I talked to my dad.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.754
He said he's willing
to give your dad
a second chance,

05:36.963 --> 05:38.798
but only if FP wants it.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.258
He's gonna call him.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.719
But I think you should
talk to him, too.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.221
Between the two of us,
I think we can really
make this thing happen.

05:46.097 --> 05:48.558
Did I just notice
Riverdale High's
very own Holden Caulfield

05:48.766 --> 05:50.727
put his arm around you?

05:51.477 --> 05:53.646
Okay, so these past
couple of days,

05:53.855 --> 05:56.858
I haven't been
in a great place, emotionally.

05:57.025 --> 06:00.445
And Jughead was really
there for me...

06:00.778 --> 06:02.780
Oh, my God. Swoon!

06:02.989 --> 06:05.491
Okay, in that case,
if he helped my girl

06:05.700 --> 06:07.577
navigate some
turbulent waters,

06:07.785 --> 06:10.496
well then,
Veronica Lodge approves.

06:10.705 --> 06:11.998
Thatta girl.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.834
Come on,
let's go find your sister.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.171
Mrs. Blossom,
we've got forensics

06:18.379 --> 06:20.465
going over every inch
of that car.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.633
We're this close to a break
in your son's case.

06:22.842 --> 06:26.262
Speaking of breaks,
what's a big one worth
to you, Mother?

06:26.471 --> 06:28.473
Letting me be
a River Vixen again?

06:28.681 --> 06:30.350
What on earth
are you talking about, Cheryl?

06:30.558 --> 06:33.227
I have information you...
Both of you,

06:33.436 --> 06:36.230
would find interesting
vis-a-vis my brother's case.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.941
But first,
the Vixens are mine.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.318
And I want your permission
to reclaim them.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.779
- Good Lord, fine.

06:42.987 --> 06:45.406
So, Ginger texted me while
I was in the ladies' room.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.200
It seems that crazy bitch,
Polly Cooper,

06:47.408 --> 06:50.286
escaped from some looney bin,
the same night Jason's car
was torched.

06:50.495 --> 06:52.580
So let me do the math for you.

06:52.789 --> 06:56.084
Polly escaping plus
Polly torching Jason's car
equals she's Jason's killer.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.378
Covering her tracks,
trying to go underground,

06:58.586 --> 07:01.547
like the vicious, cold-hearted
murdering mean girl
that she is.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.217
Oh, and I just tweeted this
out to all of my minions,

07:04.425 --> 07:07.220
so the pressure's on,
Sheriff Keller.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.222
- You guys, oh, my God.
- What?

07:09.430 --> 07:12.350
Cheryl just tweeted
#PollyCooperKilledMyBrother,

07:12.558 --> 07:15.978
#NowhereToHide,
#SharpenYourPitchforks.

07:16.187 --> 07:17.814
Oh, no.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.150
We need to find Polly
before the Blossoms do.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.223
The prodigal son returns.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.149
How you doing?
You look good.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.526
- I'm hanging in there.
- Yeah?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.528
I came by to ask...

08:05.736 --> 08:10.408
If you would consider
going back to work
with Fred Andrews.

08:12.785 --> 08:14.787
Yeah, he called me.
I said no.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.998
He fired me, Jughead.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.626
What kind of man would I be
if I went back, hat in hand?

08:20.835 --> 08:21.836
For starters?

08:22.670 --> 08:25.214
A man with a job,
trying to fix his family.

08:25.423 --> 08:26.549
Talk to your mom.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.969
She's the one
who gave up on us,
took your sister.

08:30.178 --> 08:34.056
Can you please
just go see Mr. Andrews?

08:34.265 --> 08:35.391
He's willing to give you
another chance.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.351
Oh, he's willing, huh?

08:37.560 --> 08:41.105
That's generous of him,
after all the crap
he pulled on me.

08:41.856 --> 08:45.818
Dad, don't you want to see
our family back together?

08:46.569 --> 08:48.070
Mom and Jellybean
could come home.

08:48.279 --> 08:49.322
I could come home.

08:51.741 --> 08:52.909
It's not too late.

08:56.996 --> 09:00.333
Okay, the Sisters of
Quiet Mercy are due north.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.960
The getaway car was west,
on the Old Route 40.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.337
The closest bus station
is east,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.214
headed towards Sweetwater.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.424
If Polly wanted
to leave Riverdale
without anyone seeing her,

09:08.633 --> 09:09.550
she probably
would've left through--

09:09.759 --> 09:11.427
Right here.
Eversgreen Forest.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.570
Hey, all this stuff
with your sister,

09:29.946 --> 09:31.280
I'm sorry you had to go
through that,

09:31.489 --> 09:32.949
and I wasn't there
to help you.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.661
It's okay, Arch,
you're here now.

09:37.203 --> 09:39.497
So how's the cold war
at home?

09:39.705 --> 09:40.915
Ugh. Horrible.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.375
Look, I hate fighting
with my mom,

09:42.583 --> 09:44.961
but until she's ready
to admit and to own,

09:45.169 --> 09:48.256
that she forged my name
to help her illicit trysting
with Fred Andrews,

09:48.464 --> 09:49.549
I can't blink, Kevin.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.384
She needs to make
the next move.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.219
And what if she doesn't blink?

09:53.928 --> 09:56.597
Back in New York,
whenever I needed
to blow off some steam,

09:56.806 --> 09:58.474
or force my mother's hand,

09:58.683 --> 09:59.934
I'd go out on a bender,

10:00.142 --> 10:02.603
dancing with my fave
celebrity gal-pal,

10:02.812 --> 10:04.188
my best gay,

10:04.397 --> 10:08.192
and some dim-witted, sexy,
disposable arm-candy.

10:08.401 --> 10:10.820
- That's Josie, you.
- Honored.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.155
And as for my arm-candy...

10:17.118 --> 10:18.619
He'll do.

10:18.828 --> 10:21.330
I'm in, I'm so in.

10:22.290 --> 10:23.666
Should we invite Betty?

10:23.874 --> 10:26.377
She could probably
use a distraction right now.

10:26.586 --> 10:28.504
I think she might be
a tad busy.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.731
Alice Cooper, where is she?
Where's Polly?

10:46.939 --> 10:49.984
You think if I knew that,
I'd be out here
with the mosquitoes?

10:50.192 --> 10:52.945
Face facts, Mommie Dearest,
Polly killed Jason.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.615
She escaped from
the asylum once, who's to say
she didn't before,

10:55.823 --> 10:57.908
say, the day
Jason got murdered?

10:58.117 --> 11:01.454
The noose is tightening
around your murdering
daughter's neck.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.790
- I know it,
Sheriff Keller knows it.
- Hold on now.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.501
And I promise you,
when we find her,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.086
and we will find her,

11:09.295 --> 11:11.797
the entire town of Riverdale
will know, too.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.968
Mom, is this a good idea?

11:16.177 --> 11:17.345
I thought we were trying
to contain this.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.929
Well, we were, Elizabeth.

11:19.138 --> 11:20.348
But now that
the cat's out of the bag,

11:20.556 --> 11:22.266
we're in full-on
damage-control mode.

11:22.475 --> 11:24.685
The Blossoms have their
version of the events,

11:24.894 --> 11:27.605
but they don't know
the whole story,
at least not yet.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.232
And that gives us
a momentary advantage.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.859
I don't know if I can do this.

11:32.068 --> 11:34.612
Oh, you can, and you will.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.822
You'll be standing right
beside me and your father,

11:37.031 --> 11:39.992
a united front against
the holiest of backdrops.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.995
Let's see the Blossoms
try to smear us then.

11:44.413 --> 11:47.875
There's been a swirl
of rumors today
about our daughter, Polly.

11:48.084 --> 11:51.420
And we're standing here
to tell you that
they're all false.

11:51.629 --> 11:56.008
Yes, Polly was seeking
treatment in a private
care facility,

11:56.217 --> 11:59.095
and she was under
strict observation

11:59.303 --> 12:01.889
even at the time
of Jason Blossom's death.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.225
When she found out
about the murder,

12:04.433 --> 12:06.686
she was beside
herself with grief.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.273
You see, my daughter, Polly,

12:11.482 --> 12:14.443
is pregnant with
Jason Blossom's baby.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.991
Polly wouldn't hurt a fly,

12:21.200 --> 12:23.703
let alone the father
of her unborn child.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.583
Polly, darling,
if you're watching this,

12:31.252 --> 12:32.878
please come home.

12:35.423 --> 12:37.675
Hey, you didn't have
to walk me home.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.636
Uh, there's a killer
on the loose, remember?

12:42.138 --> 12:44.890
Besides, isn't this what...

12:46.642 --> 12:47.601
You know...

12:49.270 --> 12:53.149
What people like us,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.818
who've gone through
what we've gone through, do?

12:58.988 --> 13:02.408
What is it?
I mean, besides everything.

13:04.452 --> 13:08.289
She wouldn't have run away
if it wasn't for me, Jug.

13:08.497 --> 13:14.336
Betty, your parents
were the ones lying to her,
and keeping her in the dark.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.756
You did the right thing
telling her the truth.

13:19.216 --> 13:24.764
It's funny.
This isn't the first time
Polly's run away from home.

13:24.972 --> 13:28.726
When she was nine,
she and my mom
got in this huge fight,

13:28.934 --> 13:30.519
and she disappeared for hours.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.813
The whole neighborhood
was out looking for her.

13:33.022 --> 13:34.398
How far did she get?

13:37.151 --> 13:38.194
What?

13:43.282 --> 13:45.493
Thank you
for walking me home.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.037
I'll call you later.
Goodnight.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.546
Mom? Dad?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.318
Polly?

14:21.904 --> 14:23.781
It's okay. I'm alone.

14:24.949 --> 14:26.450
Mom and Dad aren't here.

14:46.679 --> 14:48.138
Shh.

14:49.849 --> 14:53.102
Betty, you have to help me.
Please.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.860
How did you get up here
without anyone seeing you?

15:01.068 --> 15:02.903
I wrote the book on getting
in and out of this house.

15:03.112 --> 15:04.905
And Dad still hasn't fixed
the cellar door.

15:05.114 --> 15:06.991
Polly, everyone's
worried sick,

15:07.199 --> 15:09.451
why did you leave the home?
You could have really
hurt yourself.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.995
I couldn't just stay there,

15:11.203 --> 15:13.581
waiting for someone
who was never gonna show.

15:13.789 --> 15:18.210
Jason and I, we had a plan
to go to this farm, upstate,
and raise the baby.

15:18.419 --> 15:21.797
It's where I still want to go,
but I don't have any money,
I don't have anything.

15:22.006 --> 15:23.507
Why don't you
just stay here?

15:23.716 --> 15:25.509
Mom and Dad want me to give
the baby up for adoption,

15:25.718 --> 15:28.012
they made that very clear.
And that's not what I want.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.930
Well, this is
their grandchild, Polly.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.473
Everyone knows
you're pregnant now.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.933
There's no more stigma.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.602
You don't know
what they'll do.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.272
And I won't have my baby
raised in a home
that doesn't want it.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.607
Polly...

15:40.733 --> 15:42.109
Give me a few days.

15:42.318 --> 15:44.653
I'll find you someplace safe,
here in Riverdale.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.740
Please, Polly,
I cannot lose you again.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.749
This is an upgrade
from the tin can
we used to work in.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.168
Wasn't sure you were gonna
take me up on the offer.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.669
Wasn't sure it was real.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.963
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it wasn't my idea.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.507
The boys came up with this.

16:06.926 --> 16:08.636
But I probably could
have reached out before.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.432
Look, coming back here
isn't easy for me.

16:13.641 --> 16:14.600
But, hell, I...

16:18.604 --> 16:21.982
I just want my son
to look at me and not see
a piece of garbage.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.110
Feels like it might be
my last shot.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.656
Then let's make it work.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.745
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:35.663 --> 16:38.082
Hermione, you remember
FP Jones from high school.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.625
- He's gonna be
working with us.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.751
- Hermione.
- Of course.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.169
- It's been forever. Hi.
- Hi.

16:42.378 --> 16:44.964
Excuse me.
Yeah, Vic, talk to me.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.927
Look, if this is another
shake-down...

16:50.135 --> 16:51.303
No, it's not, we're good.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.389
Your convict husband
settled-up.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.849
I think he got the message
after you got
our little care-package.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.351
Why are you even here?

16:57.559 --> 16:59.478
My son asked me to try
and go straight, okay?

16:59.687 --> 17:00.980
You gonna make that
hard on me?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.690
Dudley-Do-Right
doesn't know I'm a Serpent,

17:02.898 --> 17:05.025
so I'd appreciate it
if you keep that to yourself.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.695
Because here's the thing
about snakes.

17:07.903 --> 17:10.155
You don't step on them,
they got no reason to bite.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.203
Mom, Dad,
when we find Polly,

17:16.412 --> 17:18.872
she's gonna
live with us, right?

17:19.081 --> 17:24.878
At this point,
there's no reason to hide
or banish her, is there?

17:25.087 --> 17:27.756
Oh, of course not, honey.
She's welcome back.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.720
Where will the baby sleep?

17:32.928 --> 17:35.889
Sweetie, um, we've talked
to your sister about this,

17:36.056 --> 17:38.392
and she's agreed to put
the baby up for adoption.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.477
Polly did?

17:41.812 --> 17:45.065
This is a very difficult
decision for a young
mother to make,

17:45.274 --> 17:48.777
but given the circumstances,
it's the best.

17:48.986 --> 17:52.156
- The only...
- The only option.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.410
Why do you ask, honey?

17:58.871 --> 18:02.041
No reason.
Just curious.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.918
I don't want Polly
to run away.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.962
But if she can't
live at home, then...

18:07.171 --> 18:10.090
I don't know,
I can rent her an apartment.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.842
Let me talk to my mom.

18:12.051 --> 18:14.428
No, you have your
own stuff you're dealing
with right now, V.

18:14.636 --> 18:18.265
Betty, Polly needs doctors,
she needs prenatal vitamins...

18:18.474 --> 18:20.142
She needs her family.

18:25.314 --> 18:26.899
What do you want, Cheryl?

18:27.441 --> 18:28.817
What we both want.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.113
For the baby to be safe.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.158
How can I help?

18:36.366 --> 18:38.994
You can't,
I don't trust you, Cheryl.

18:39.203 --> 18:42.122
So don't trust me.
Watch me like a hawk.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.791
Tell me the barest minimum.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.459
But let me help you
help Polly.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.835
You think Polly's crazy.

18:47.044 --> 18:51.173
I do, I think she's crazier
than a serial killer
on bath-salts, but so what?

18:51.381 --> 18:55.135
She's carrying Jason's baby.
That trumps everything.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.678
Do you know where she is?

18:57.930 --> 18:59.306
If I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.683
- Oh, my God, you do.
- What? No.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.603
Wow, you are literally
the worst liar
I've ever encountered.

19:04.812 --> 19:06.271
Spare me the details, Betty.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.316
Just tell me
how I can be of assistance
to my darling nephew or niece.

19:10.359 --> 19:13.737
Okay, uh,
Polly needs money.

19:13.946 --> 19:15.989
For a safe place to live.
And for medical stuff.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.408
Cash? Is that all?

19:18.617 --> 19:19.576
I can talk to my mom and dad.

19:19.785 --> 19:20.994
What? No, Cheryl.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.539
Jason's baby
is a game-changer.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.124
We're all on
the same team now.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.424
- Oh, how was
your first day back?
Oh, it was great.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.136
Your dad is
the hardest-working guy
on the crew, as always.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.304
Oh, in that case,

19:39.513 --> 19:40.931
why don't we celebrate
to mark the occasion?

19:41.140 --> 19:42.141
Yeah, Juggy and I
were thinking

19:42.349 --> 19:43.559
the four of us could have
dinner or something.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.227
Uh, tonight?
I don't know...

19:45.435 --> 19:46.728
I'm game if you're game.

19:47.813 --> 19:48.814
On me.

19:53.861 --> 19:54.903
Anyway...

19:55.112 --> 19:58.073
We spent the whole summer
fixing up that old VW bus.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.366
Yeah.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.868
Remember what
we called it, Fred?

20:01.076 --> 20:03.328
The Shaggin' Wagon.

20:03.537 --> 20:04.955
The Shaggin' Wagon.

20:05.164 --> 20:06.623
This was before
your dad had game.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.292
Senior Year,
he started a band,

20:08.500 --> 20:09.918
and then the girls
were all over him.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.086
We were awful.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.171
Yeah, yeah, we were.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.589
Oh.

20:13.797 --> 20:17.509
But it was great.
Best time of my life.

20:18.969 --> 20:23.432
You know, your dad
was what is commonly known
as a BMOC, Jughead.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.601
- Come on. The hell I was.
- In what way?

20:25.809 --> 20:26.894
Football, for one.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.022
He single-handedly
defeated our arch-rivals,
the Baxter High Ravens.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.567
He doesn't care
about that stuff, Fred.
Football, sports.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.985
Takes after his mom
in that respect,

20:35.194 --> 20:36.361
and I mean that
as a compliment.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.197
I'd rather see you
spending your time

20:38.405 --> 20:41.742
writing, thinking up stories,
you still do that?

20:41.950 --> 20:44.369
Nose in a book?
Typing away?

20:44.578 --> 20:47.080
Yeah, yeah, Jughead works on
the school paper with Betty.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.457
Betty?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.251
Ooh.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.212
Who is Betty?
Is that your girlfriend?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.504
She's...

20:54.713 --> 20:58.091
I wanna know
more about the band.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.135
What was the name
of the band?

21:01.470 --> 21:02.387
Ah, yeah.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.348
It was called The Fred Heads.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.100
Wait, the what now?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.936
Yeah, that's why it doesn't
come up very often.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.437
Oh, thanks, Pop.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.649
Oh, come on, Fred.
This was supposed
to be my treat.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.067
Hey, you get it next time.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.529
Hey, excuse me. Pop?

21:20.155 --> 21:21.990
We invited you guys out.
Let me pay.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.367
Put your damn money away.

21:23.575 --> 21:24.743
FP, take it easy.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.538
You owe me this.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.625
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.377
Go ahead.
You get this one.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.963
You know, if I'd have known,
I would have gotten
another milkshake.

21:40.968 --> 21:42.844
Where are you going?

21:43.053 --> 21:45.013
And don't say clubbing,
it's a school night.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.473
But that's exactly
where I'm going,

21:46.682 --> 21:47.766
and do you know why?

21:47.975 --> 21:49.476
Because I have a Get Out
of Jail Free card.

21:49.643 --> 21:53.105
Okay, Ronnie, enough.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.482
Checkmate.
What do you want?

21:55.691 --> 21:56.858
For you to admit
what you did.

21:57.067 --> 22:00.153
Fine.
I kissed Fred Andrews.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.697
No, Mom, the other thing.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.532
It involves you
forging my signature

22:03.740 --> 22:06.493
to get Fred Andrews
that stupid contract
to build on Dad's land.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.120
Veronica, I asked you
to sign that...

22:08.328 --> 22:10.789
You broke the law, Mom,
and you used me to do it.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.833
When Daddy finds out,
he's gonna think
I betrayed him.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.710
He won't, I will tell him.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.587
Really? When?
Right now?

22:17.796 --> 22:19.006
Because I'll cancel
my plans for that.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.799
You know it doesn't
work that way.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.135
In that case,
I'll talk to you later,
my friends are waiting.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.347
Ronnie, do not
go out that door.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.308
Veronica!

23:10.223 --> 23:11.141
Ah!

23:13.185 --> 23:15.604
Mmm-mmm, girl.
You better hydrate.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.107
You practically left
your body on the dance floor.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.567
I wish, Josie.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.778
I wish I could leave
my body sometimes.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.030
Leave Riverdale,
leave everything.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.490
Is any of this helping?

23:26.698 --> 23:30.327
Going out, going <i>Black Swan,</i>
any of it?

23:32.079 --> 23:34.289
When my dad got arrested,

23:34.498 --> 23:37.417
the police, the lawyers,
the judge, the courts,

23:37.626 --> 23:39.378
they took everything from us.

23:39.586 --> 23:45.425
Our houses, our cars,
our club memberships,
our yacht,

23:45.634 --> 23:48.387
even, I'm not kidding,
the clothes off our backs.

23:51.139 --> 23:55.185
Anyway, my mom sat me down
on the edge of my canopy bed

23:55.394 --> 23:56.978
and she told me not to cry.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.856
Because there was one thing
in this world

24:00.065 --> 24:02.150
that no one could ever
take from me.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.361
- Not ever.
- Your trust fund?

24:05.654 --> 24:07.280
My name, Reggie.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.658
Which, after telling me
no one would ever take it,

24:09.866 --> 24:12.536
that is exactly what she did.

24:14.413 --> 24:15.831
Like it meant nothing.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.543
Like it was nothing.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.255
Like I was nothing.

24:35.684 --> 24:37.227
Damn, Hoss, you're good.

24:37.436 --> 24:38.937
Way better than your dad.

24:39.146 --> 24:40.730
Hey, does Fred
keep any beer in there?

24:41.481 --> 24:42.441
Uh...

24:42.649 --> 24:44.943
Dad, don't you think
it's a little late? Kinda...

24:45.152 --> 24:47.529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, it's all right.

24:47.737 --> 24:49.906
You know, I got a big day
tomorrow anyway.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.286
Hey, Mr. Jones,
before you go,

24:54.494 --> 24:56.163
- can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.957
Earlier tonight,
you said my dad owed you.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.917
What did you mean by that?

25:01.126 --> 25:04.671
Hey, Archie,
why don't we quit
while we're ahead?

25:05.380 --> 25:07.799
It's just...
I mean, it's just a question.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.469
Did something happen
between you two?

25:11.344 --> 25:15.182
It's ancient history,
but your dad and me, we...

25:15.390 --> 25:17.058
We started Andrews
Construction together.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.393
You and my dad
were partners?

25:18.602 --> 25:20.604
He wouldn't call us that.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.940
Anyway, we, uh...

25:24.900 --> 25:27.611
We struggled at first.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.697
Fred, he just had you
and your mom to provide for,

25:30.906 --> 25:35.452
I had Jughead and Jellybean
and their mom
and hospital bills.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.663
So I took some odd jobs
that weren't exactly
on the level.

25:38.872 --> 25:42.083
And sure enough, one of 'em
landed me in some hot water,

25:42.292 --> 25:46.796
and your dad was good enough
to bail me out.

25:48.465 --> 25:51.259
But then he said
we should part ways.
That I was a liability.

25:51.468 --> 25:55.472
Made me sign a paper
saying the bail money was him
buying me out of the company.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.682
Never mind that my share
of the business

25:57.891 --> 26:00.644
was worth probably
10 times that, easy.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.357
So that was that.

26:06.525 --> 26:09.402
He went his way,
and I went mine.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.698
You know, I think I need
something a little harder
than beer.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.703
Clifford and I
were so relieved

26:18.912 --> 26:21.915
when Cheryl told us
that Polly and the baby
are safe and sound.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.583
And money won't be
a problem, Betty.

26:23.792 --> 26:27.254
Not now, not ever.
Not with us.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.549
But, of course,
we don't want to just offer
financial support,

26:30.757 --> 26:32.801
we want to give Polly
all the emotional support

26:33.009 --> 26:35.262
that a young
mother-to-be needs.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.223
Where is Polly staying now?

26:40.433 --> 26:42.936
I'd rather not say yet.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.938
You understand.

26:45.146 --> 26:49.025
Of course, but you and Polly
are part of the Blossom
family now,

26:49.276 --> 26:53.154
and we will protect you
ferociously.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.616
All you have to do is trust.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.035
Will you?

27:05.667 --> 27:08.795
Jughead,
what your dad told us...
I had no idea.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.297
Me neither.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.840
Illuminating, isn't it?

27:14.134 --> 27:17.012
My dad must've had
a good reason.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.805
For screwing over my dad?

27:19.014 --> 27:20.473
Are you ready to roll,
Jugs?

27:28.857 --> 27:30.692
See you tomorrow.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.742
I'm sorry, Ms. Lodge,
but your card's been declined.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.076
Really?

27:41.077 --> 27:43.455
And let me guess,
it's been reported stolen.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.040
It has, in fact.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.666
We're supposed
to call the cops.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.126
Yeah, sure.
Call the cops.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.669
We'll be happy
to tell them how old we are.

27:49.878 --> 27:53.423
Or I could call my mom,
the mayor.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.926
This should cover it.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.767
Veronica, did your mom
cut you off?

28:03.975 --> 28:05.352
She did.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.354
- And that's a good thing?
- Oh, Reggie.

28:07.562 --> 28:10.023
This is how
we Lodge women roll.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.318
We feint, we parry,
we approach, we retreat.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.737
We're like a cobra
and a mongoose dancing.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.865
She blinked, which means,
I suspect,

28:19.074 --> 28:21.326
that Hermione Lodge
is ready to negotiate.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.371
Wow. Oh.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.415
I'll sleep right here
on this couch,

28:27.624 --> 28:29.209
you can have the bedroom.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.044
I'm not gonna take
your bed, Dad.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.630
It wouldn't be the first time
I crashed on this thing.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.256
Ah, thank you.

28:36.049 --> 28:39.135
If you stay... Are you?
You're gonna stay?

28:40.345 --> 28:41.721
Don't be late for school.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.556
It's all right.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.934
I'm already way ahead
in all my classes.

28:46.142 --> 28:48.061
Hey, I talked to Mom.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.898
She got a job at a call center
to pay for her online classes.

28:52.107 --> 28:55.985
I guess she's finally
going after her GED.

28:56.194 --> 28:58.488
Jellybean is helping
her study.

28:58.697 --> 29:01.658
By the way, Jellybean wants
to go with JB now.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.868
She thinks it sounds cooler.

29:04.369 --> 29:08.581
She's 10 years old and listens
to Pink Floyd on vinyl,

29:08.790 --> 29:10.750
I don't think
she could get any cooler.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.221
How was your jam session?

29:23.430 --> 29:26.391
It was great,
until FP told us

29:26.599 --> 29:28.893
you forced him out
of the company
he helped found.

29:29.102 --> 29:33.857
That's his story,
wanna hear mine, hmm?

29:34.065 --> 29:35.608
FP was a mess.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.069
He was stealing
from the company
and selling stuff on the side.

29:38.278 --> 29:41.197
All things considered,
I was pretty generous.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.158
So generous you didn't
give him a second chance?

29:43.366 --> 29:44.743
Of course I did.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.787
You have no idea
how many times
I bailed that man out of jail.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.416
Son, when someone is drowning,

29:51.624 --> 29:54.711
you can try to save them,
but not if they're gonna
drag you down with them.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.797
I did the best I could
for my family.

29:59.132 --> 29:59.758
For you.

30:03.386 --> 30:06.222
Yeah, and who cares if Jughead
ended up drowning, too.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.531
Reporting my American Excess
card as stolen,

30:23.740 --> 30:25.116
well-played.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.410
I thought you might
appreciate that.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.872
Now, <i>mija.</i>
I've done things to upset you.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.999
You've done things
to upset me.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.710
So we're gonna deal
with this exactly
as your father would like.

30:35.919 --> 30:37.670
With a negotiation.
I'll start.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.174
I am working with Mr. Andrews,

30:41.382 --> 30:44.636
and yes, we are developing
feelings for each other.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.304
But I can't tell you
what it means yet

30:46.513 --> 30:47.972
because I don't know myself.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.182
What about Daddy?

30:49.390 --> 30:54.145
He has made certain decisions
that have distanced him
from me, and this family.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.439
So I need to make
certain decisions

30:56.648 --> 31:00.819
about my life moving forward,
what I want.

31:01.027 --> 31:04.155
So, what, you want me
to accept your affair?

31:04.364 --> 31:06.825
Until we get
more information, yes.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.078
That is what
I'm asking you to accept.

31:11.496 --> 31:14.040
Fine. Agreed.
Now, my turn.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.667
I'm listening.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.335
Whatever is happening
with you and Fred,

31:17.544 --> 31:18.962
can't happen under this roof.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.004
Agreed.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.466
And you have to come clean
to Daddy about forging
my signature.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.134
Lodge Industries
needs to partner

31:25.343 --> 31:27.053
with legitimate businesses,
not criminals.

31:27.262 --> 31:30.056
Understood.
I don't want Daddy thinking
I betrayed him.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.059
I will tell him
about the forgery.

31:33.268 --> 31:34.602
And say it was all my doing.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.105
And in the meantime,
the online shopping,

31:37.939 --> 31:38.982
the clubbing,

31:40.400 --> 31:41.526
all that stops.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.153
- Yes?
- Yes.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.888
Uh, what's up?

32:10.096 --> 32:12.432
I'm going to need you to come
down to the station with me.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.277
Call my dad.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.653
- Yeah, yeah.
- Of course.

32:30.575 --> 32:32.702
Forensics came back
on the car.

32:32.911 --> 32:36.915
Despite the fire,
we were able to pull a pair
of prints off the trunk.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.166
Yours and Betty's.

32:38.374 --> 32:39.834
This is, of course,
no surprise.

32:40.043 --> 32:43.296
But what did surprise me
was this.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.173
Your prints were on file

32:45.381 --> 32:47.550
from an incident that happened
six years ago,

32:47.759 --> 32:51.846
where you spent some time
with the Riverdale Juvenile
Delinquent Center for...

32:54.933 --> 32:57.936
"Attempting to burn down
Riverdale Elementary School."

32:58.144 --> 32:59.395
I was playing with matches,

33:00.063 --> 33:02.440
and that's a pretty tenuous
connection for a sheriff.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.276
Well, Principal Weatherbee
also allowed me

33:05.443 --> 33:07.445
to have a look
at your school records.

33:07.654 --> 33:10.698
You have a long and
rough history, Mr. Jones.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.116
Bullied a lot.

33:12.325 --> 33:14.869
Yeah, my name is Jughead.

33:15.078 --> 33:17.205
By the football team,
in particular.

33:17.413 --> 33:20.291
I can only assume that would
have included Jason Blossom.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.834
So how about this?

33:22.001 --> 33:24.796
How about you tell me
your whereabouts
on the week of July 11th?

33:25.004 --> 33:27.256
This is crazy.
You think I...

33:30.051 --> 33:32.553
Jughead. A kid like you,

33:32.762 --> 33:35.223
raised on the wrong side of
the tracks by a deadbeat dad,

33:35.431 --> 33:37.642
bullied by kids
like Jason Blossom.

33:38.977 --> 33:40.603
Who wouldn't want
to lash out at that?

33:42.981 --> 33:44.941
I'm not talking
to you anymore.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.275
I want a lawyer.

33:52.156 --> 33:56.452
Cheryl, you've called Polly
a party girl.

33:56.661 --> 33:59.247
Have you seen her take drugs?
Firsthand?

34:01.040 --> 34:05.044
Um... I'm not sure, why?

34:06.004 --> 34:07.422
Due diligence.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.007
We wouldn't want
an unfit mother

34:09.215 --> 34:11.426
raising our grandchild now,
would we?

34:14.262 --> 34:15.847
No, of course not.

34:28.651 --> 34:30.695
I didn't do it, Betty,
you have to believe me.

34:30.903 --> 34:34.782
Of course, I was with you,
and I know who you are.

34:34.991 --> 34:37.118
Those <i>Paradise Lost</i> kids
went to death row

34:37.326 --> 34:38.369
because they wore black

34:38.578 --> 34:39.829
and they listened
to Metallica.

34:40.747 --> 34:41.789
I don't wanna become
a scapegoat.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.541
I'm not gonna let that happen.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.879
All the evidence against you
is circumstantial.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.048
We're gonna get you
out of here.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.218
Is my dad here yet?

34:54.427 --> 34:56.137
Archie's here with his dad.

34:56.345 --> 34:57.680
They're talking
to the Sheriff.

34:59.724 --> 35:02.226
No one knows
where your dad is.

35:02.435 --> 35:04.270
Jughead's not helping
himself in there.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.731
I asked him for an alibi,
and he just gave me lip.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.192
He was working for me.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.028
Yeah, the week
of July 11th, was it?

35:12.236 --> 35:14.238
Yeah, I had him tear down
some drywall for me.

35:16.908 --> 35:19.619
You can provide me
with documentation
to support that?

35:20.912 --> 35:23.081
I have to check my time cards.

35:32.340 --> 35:33.299
Jughead!

35:34.008 --> 35:35.468
I'm sorry.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.678
I came as soon
as I got your messages.

35:37.887 --> 35:39.514
My phone,
the friggin' battery.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.432
I forgot to plug it in
last night.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.937
- What the hell happened?
- Nothing.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.605
It's fine now.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.440
Mr. Andrews took care of it.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.111
What jacked-up crap
did they accuse you
of in there, huh?

35:53.319 --> 35:54.779
Those bastards trying
to throw you in jail

35:54.987 --> 35:57.406
like they did your old man?
Well, screw that.

35:58.032 --> 35:59.909
I will rip Keller a new one
for trying to pull that...

36:00.118 --> 36:01.244
- FP, settle down.
- Hey! Hey!

36:01.452 --> 36:03.788
This is my son,
he is my son, Fred!

36:03.996 --> 36:05.456
You'd do the same
for your boy.

36:05.665 --> 36:06.749
Dad.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.962
Don't make things worse.

36:12.672 --> 36:13.631
Please.

36:17.718 --> 36:18.761
Yeah.

36:20.388 --> 36:21.806
Yeah, all right, then.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.852
You, uh,
coming home with me?

36:27.979 --> 36:30.273
He can stay with us,
Mr. Jones.

36:31.858 --> 36:32.984
We already offered.

36:34.735 --> 36:35.945
Is that what you want?

36:41.534 --> 36:42.994
Maybe that's for the best.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.495
If you don't mind, Fred.

36:46.497 --> 36:47.790
Whatever you want, FP.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.585
It's between the two of you.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.629
I'll go with you, Dad.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.766
Son, listen to me.

37:09.604 --> 37:11.272
I'm gonna do what you want,

37:12.607 --> 37:14.400
get my act together.

37:14.609 --> 37:17.153
I'm gonna get your mom
and Jellybean home

37:17.361 --> 37:18.821
so we're all
under the same roof.

37:20.072 --> 37:22.033
I promise. But I...

37:22.241 --> 37:24.118
I just need a little time
to do that.

37:24.327 --> 37:27.580
Not a lot, not long,
a month, two at the most.

37:28.873 --> 37:29.832
Hey.

37:31.542 --> 37:35.671
And then we'll be back
on track, all right?

37:36.547 --> 37:37.340
You...

37:38.382 --> 37:40.176
You believe that, don't you?

37:44.555 --> 37:47.266
Yeah, I believe you, Dad.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.780
All right.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.516
Any minute now.

38:30.559 --> 38:31.811
How do you feel?

38:34.146 --> 38:35.481
Partnering with
Andrews Construction

38:35.648 --> 38:38.150
was the right decision
to make.

38:39.568 --> 38:41.612
And your father will either
see that or he won't.

38:43.572 --> 38:45.366
Either way, I can live
with the consequences.

38:53.291 --> 38:54.333
Hello.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.419
<i>You're receiving
a call from</i>
<i>Penitentiary.</i>

38:56.627 --> 38:57.837
<i>Will you accept the charges?</i>

38:58.045 --> 38:59.255
I'll accept the charges.

39:09.056 --> 39:11.017
Looks like
you've done this before.

39:11.225 --> 39:15.354
Yeah, well, FP's got
his tricks, I got mine.

39:15.563 --> 39:17.857
Maybe I should've given him
another chance back then.

39:18.065 --> 39:21.027
Either way,
Jughead doesn't deserve
what's happening to him.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.195
It's the least I can do.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.617
The Blossoms
should be here soon.

39:28.826 --> 39:31.454
Once we've talked
things through with them,
we'll call Mom and Dad.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.415
Are you nervous?

39:35.708 --> 39:37.001
I'm thankful.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.880
At the home,
the Sisters said each of us
had a guardian angel.

39:41.839 --> 39:44.258
You're mine, Betty.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.264
Cheryl...

39:57.897 --> 39:59.815
I'm so sorry about Jason,

40:00.024 --> 40:01.609
I know how much you loved him.

40:05.529 --> 40:07.406
And he always talked
about how much he loved you.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.245
Cheryl, where are
your mom and dad?

40:16.874 --> 40:18.959
You have to leave. Now.

40:19.627 --> 40:21.295
My parents, I don't think
they want to help you.

40:21.504 --> 40:22.713
What are you talking about?

40:22.922 --> 40:24.048
They want you
out of the picture, Polly.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.466
It's not safe
for you with them.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.552
It's not safe
for JayJay's baby.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.848
Where am I supposed to go?
I can't go back to the attic.

40:33.057 --> 40:34.767
No.
You don't have to, Polly.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.145
And don't worry
about my mom, Betty,
she'll want to help.

40:38.354 --> 40:40.523
Of course you can stay.
As long as you need.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.025
Anything for
Alice Cooper's daughters.

40:43.234 --> 40:44.527
Thank you, Mrs. Lodge.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.278
- And thank you, Veronica.
- Yeah.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.197
You're welcome, girls.

40:48.406 --> 40:50.074
And please, now that we're
going to be roommates, Polly,

40:50.282 --> 40:51.325
it's Hermione.

40:51.534 --> 40:53.119
Come, sit,
make yourself at home.

41:01.794 --> 41:03.087
I'm sorry about my dad,

41:04.296 --> 41:05.965
and your dad.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.008
I'm not giving up
on him, Arch.

41:09.677 --> 41:10.886
Not yet.

41:13.139 --> 41:14.723
You think he'll show up
for work tomorrow?

41:16.058 --> 41:18.978
You never know. I hope.

41:22.189 --> 41:26.152
<i>Hope.
A word so close to home,</i>

41:26.360 --> 41:27.695
<i>and as tricky.</i>

41:30.281 --> 41:32.658
<i>As much as we wanted
Jason's killer caught,</i>

41:32.867 --> 41:35.995
<i>and the town, our home,
to feel safe again,</i>

41:36.203 --> 41:40.833
<i>with every day that passed,
our hopes dimmed
more and more.</i>

41:41.041 --> 41:43.169
<i>There's that old,
cliched saying,</i>

41:43.377 --> 41:45.754
<i>"It's darkest
before the dawn."</i>

41:46.297 --> 41:47.423
<i>But sometimes...</i>

41:49.258 --> 41:51.719
<i>There's just darkness.</i>
