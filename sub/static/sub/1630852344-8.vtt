WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:25.108
-
-We've got another jump.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.277
A familiar face.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.155
PizzaRave. Charges?

00:30.238 --> 00:31.698
Skipped bail for theft.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.159
Wow, many thefts.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.078
Pretty sure she's the SoCal Stereo Bandit.

00:37.162 --> 00:42.000
Oh, I love the smell of
a fresh bounty in the morning.

00:42.083 --> 00:45.420
Getting fired from the agency was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.756
Let's manacle that felon!

00:47.839 --> 00:50.675


00:52.427 --> 00:54.929
Aw, man!

00:55.889 --> 00:58.475


01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
I'll cover the back!

01:04.481 --> 01:06.858
PizzaRave, we have you surrounded.

01:06.941 --> 01:10.987
You did the crime, now you gotta
do the time to put this chapter behind.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.741
A life on the run is no life,
not unless you can run free.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.705
-Roscoe, now!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.082
Whoa!

01:23.958 --> 01:26.461
Another criminal off the streets.

01:26.544 --> 01:31.591
Halted at the intersection of
Squandered Potential and Poor Decisions.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.552
Is this the end of PizzaRave?

01:34.636 --> 01:37.472
I'd prefer for you to see it
as a new beginning.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.357
Gare-Bear!

01:47.857 --> 01:48.691
What?

01:49.776 --> 01:50.944
We're on our way.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.111
The agency needs us.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.864
Aw.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.784
You're excited to see them again,
aren't you?

01:57.867 --> 02:01.121
Excited to see them
come crawling back on their slimy bellies

02:01.204 --> 02:03.456
like the squishy slugs they are!

02:03.540 --> 02:06.209
-Ah, family.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.046
I can't believe Dann got away.
We almost had her!

02:10.630 --> 02:13.049
I also can't believe
you pretended not to listen to me

02:13.133 --> 02:14.968
when I said she was still out there!

02:15.051 --> 02:17.387
<i>Uh, guys, I think we've got a problem.</i>

02:17.470 --> 02:20.557
This SUV just jumped on our tail
and it's coming up fast.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.309
-It's gotta be Dann.
-It's gonna ram us!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.020
Deploy laser cannons!

02:31.526 --> 02:33.153
-Missed him!

02:33.236 --> 02:34.904
-<i> She's on the roof!</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:36.156
<i>Turn on the fan!</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:43.288
She's avoiding our cameras.
Frostee, scan for explosives!

02:43.371 --> 02:44.706
<i>I got nothing!</i>

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
Where is she?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.002
-Kaboom!

02:52.505 --> 02:57.677
It's good to be tunneling through
the undercarriage of a moving truck again.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.262
Palindrome, you can come out now.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.976
-Sorry! She wanted to do that.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.359
-It's great to see you, Ms. Nowhere.
-Ms. Nowhere is dead.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.904
I'm just Janet now.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.739
Nice to meet you, Jan!

03:17.822 --> 03:21.409
Call me Jan one more time
and I'll "jan" this pen up your nose!

03:21.910 --> 03:26.414
You may be called Janet,
but you sure sound a lot like Ms. Nowhere.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.751
Enough! What do we have so far?

03:29.834 --> 03:32.837
Gary, Julius and I combed through
the God's Eye footage for Dann.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.758
These markers show where she's been
but we have no idea what she's up to.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.929
Now we're together again, we can hunt her
down the old-fashioned way: as a family.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.848
So let's split up!
Everyone pick a spot on the map to check.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.060
We may find a clue about Dann's plan
at one of the places she's been.

03:47.143 --> 03:51.022
-I'll take that one, way out east.
-Heck yeah, dawg! Road trip!

03:51.105 --> 03:53.399
Uh, actually my moms need to go out there

03:53.483 --> 03:56.361
to pick up some rattlesnake sausage
for the restaurant,

03:56.444 --> 03:59.364
so I was hoping to
log some time behind the wheel.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.281
Wait, what?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.742
I got my learner's permit
a couple months ago,

04:02.825 --> 04:06.287
and I need 50 hours of supervised driving
to take my license test.

04:06.371 --> 04:11.084
So watch out for slippery streets
because the roads are getting Frostee!

04:11.584 --> 04:13.044
Look who's growing up!

04:13.127 --> 04:16.547
-Yeah! Uh, c-congrats.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.424
You upset, Cisco?

04:19.008 --> 04:23.638
What? No way!
I'm fine! I'm awesome!

04:23.721 --> 04:24.889
I'm, I'm fine.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.814
We swept all of La Brea Studios for
signs of Dann, except for the tar pits.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.565
Julius and I can check it out.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.235
I gotta finish filming
a <i>Limo 3 </i>scene on the backlot,

04:37.318 --> 04:38.653
but I can drive y'all there.

04:39.237 --> 04:43.366
I'll help with Gary and Julius.
You know, since we're all moving on.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.202
Spending time with other people,
like our moms.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.246
So I'll just be with my dads.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.165
Who are Gary and Julius,
if that was unclear.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.334
Where do you wanna go, T?

04:53.418 --> 04:56.129
Matsuo just opened up
a meditation center in the mountains.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.881
If we want to find Dann,
we should talk to another robot.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.882
I'll come with.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.260
W-W-What, you think I need a babysitter?

05:02.844 --> 05:03.761
Yeah, a little.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.097
Well… I don't.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.892
You've been tackling elderly women
for the past four months!

05:09.976 --> 05:12.061
Yeah. Could a baby do that?!

05:12.145 --> 05:16.024
Looks like someone's got
an operational control problem.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.776
And with a lethal,
sophisticated super-weapon

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
stalking the streets of Los Angeles,

05:21.279 --> 05:26.326
it's no wonder the Director has come
begging for my incomparable expertise.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.620
Sorry, but nobody is
officially working for the agency

05:29.704 --> 05:32.165
except for Gary, Julius and me.

05:32.248 --> 05:36.210
The Director specifically directed me
not to let the rest of the team back.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.962
What are you talking about?

05:38.046 --> 05:41.424
Are you saying there were no tears?
No groveling?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.761
No gross hiccuppy sound
in the back of his throat

05:44.844 --> 05:47.930
to signal an impending ugly-cry session?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.640
Uh, no.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.684
Then forget this!

05:51.768 --> 05:56.522
I have a bounty-hunting biz to run!
I never would have come back anyway!

05:56.606 --> 05:59.442
-But you just said you would!
-Let's roll, boys!

05:59.525 --> 06:01.527
No. Palindrome, you just got back!

06:02.278 --> 06:03.404
Sorry, boys.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.198
Please don't forget to write.

06:05.281 --> 06:09.535
Our correspondence is my dearest treasure.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.163
Looks like a hard pass from Janet.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.999
Then we'll have to
handle this ourselves.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.334
Let's go protect our city

06:16.417 --> 06:19.420
from a diabolical robot
intent on destroying humanity.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.715
Man, I know
this is super dangerous and everything,

06:22.799 --> 06:25.635
but I'm really gonna miss
getting to say stuff like that.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.852
Hey, Matsuo. Long time no see.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.063
We're investigating a new threat: Dann,

06:37.146 --> 06:39.899
short for Data Analysis Neural Network.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.279
She's a cybernetic super-soldier

06:45.363 --> 06:48.950
with an AI system programmed to identify
and eliminate threats to humanity.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.203
And Echo's agency created her,
but she got out of hand.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.330
Now she's in LA, and long story short,

06:54.413 --> 06:57.792
this lady is definitely capable
of destroying the entire city.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.548
If you want to save
your little paradise up here,

07:03.631 --> 07:06.425
then we need your help
to figure out her weaknesses.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.637
You've taken a vow of silence?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.474
So you can still answer
yes or no questions.

07:14.892 --> 07:18.438
"Go away." Wow, you really
planned ahead getting all these printed.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.191
We're not leaving
until we get what we came for.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.485
-You'll talk eventually.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.001
That's rattlesnake for
"Rattlesnakes, here we come!"

07:40.084 --> 07:43.212
Go through your checklist,
my little defensive driver!

07:43.296 --> 07:45.506
Hm. Mirrors look good.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.216
Hands at nine and three.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.802
-The latest recommendation--
-The latest recommendation…

07:49.886 --> 07:51.429
Now for seatbelts.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.765
Got your seatbelt on, Sissy?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.393
I'm working on it.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.401
Any progress?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.237
-Yeah, I think I finally see the buckle!

08:08.321 --> 08:09.655
-Oh wait, nope.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.282
This one's for the other side.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.161
-Can we just leave her at home?!
-No!

08:15.244 --> 08:17.288
-Hands at nine and three!

08:21.626 --> 08:24.670
Have you guys found anything left by Dann?
Are you doing alright?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.714
Nothing yet, but we're okay.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.050
Speak for yourself. I'm wigging out!

08:29.133 --> 08:31.385
I shouldn't have done
so much research beforehand.

08:31.969 --> 08:35.848
Did you know a woman
died in here 9,000 years ago?

08:36.432 --> 08:39.810
What if the La Brea Woman's ghost
is the only thing we find?!

08:40.478 --> 08:42.939
Aw man, ghosts are the worst!

08:43.022 --> 08:46.150
Be careful in there. Let me know
if you want me to pull you back out.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.777
-Cisco!

08:47.860 --> 08:50.821
-What is it? Did you see Dann again?
-Nope, this isn't about Dann.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.449
I got another problem.
We just had an actor drop out.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.785
How'd you like to play
a minor role in <i>Limo 3?</i>

08:56.494 --> 08:58.454
What?!

08:58.538 --> 09:02.500
Bro! I'd love to!
But what happened to the old actor?

09:02.583 --> 09:06.629
Don't worry about that. I fixed my brakes.
You'll be fine. It only takes ten minutes.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.007
Okay. Wow!

09:10.091 --> 09:12.927
-Thank you! I am ready for my close-up!

09:18.349 --> 09:21.185
Okay, alright, alright.
So how do we get Matsuo to talk?

09:21.269 --> 09:24.522
I mean, maybe if we, like, smack him
with something and he'll say, "Ow!"

09:24.605 --> 09:26.357
Boom! Vow of silence broken.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.984
Uh, that's a dumb idea.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.486
Why do you always have to act so superior?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.281
Okay, look, listen. Tell me.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.658
If I hadn't spotted you
at La Brea Studios,

09:35.741 --> 09:39.412
would you have kept secretly stealing
my intel and working the case without me?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.873
We're working together now.
Can you just let it go?

09:42.957 --> 09:45.167
This is exactly like back when…

09:45.251 --> 09:46.961
Never mind.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.588
No, what were you gonna say?

09:49.505 --> 09:52.341
It's like when I got into spy school
and you didn't.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.304
You were super jealous and weird
and let it get in the way of the mission.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.015
What? I was super supportive!

09:59.765 --> 10:02.602
You're just bragging.
I can't believe you'd even bring that up.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.396
-Now who can't let things go?
-Still you, I think.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.151
"Jealous and weird."

10:10.234 --> 10:13.404
I'm the opposite of jealous,
and weird!

10:13.487 --> 10:16.240
-I'm completely envyless, and-- Ow!

10:34.258 --> 10:36.469
Nice of you to stop for a pedestrian.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.512
Where's the cash?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.600
And… cut!

10:45.019 --> 10:47.104
That was great! Let's move on.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.523
Actually, can we
take it from the top one more time?

10:49.607 --> 10:52.610
I-I feel like I'm finally
getting to the heart of my character.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.445
I feel that.

10:54.528 --> 10:58.324
You've got a secret, don't you?
Well, let's find out.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.493
Alright, back to ones, everybody!

11:00.993 --> 11:05.039
We've already literally burned through
three other limos, so I think--

11:05.122 --> 11:06.290
I'm sorry,

11:06.374 --> 11:10.252
but a brave artist just asked for
the opportunity to make our film better.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.631
You want to whine about
your check book, do it off my set!

11:13.714 --> 11:15.132
We're going again.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.103
Welcome to How the Sausage
is Made Rattlesnake Sausages:

11:27.186 --> 11:30.815
because everyone wants to know
how the sausage is made!

11:30.898 --> 11:32.441
Rusty?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.442
Frostee.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.028
Y-You two know each other?

11:36.112 --> 11:40.783
Uh, your agency isn't associated with the
Department of Health in any way, is it?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.284
No…

11:42.368 --> 11:46.288
Are you out here working with a ruthless
super-intelligent killing machine?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.666
Well, hold on, now.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.918
Somebody's skipping
to the end of the tour.

11:51.001 --> 11:54.839
You see, <i>reptilias shakarus</i>
has been maligned throughout history

11:54.922 --> 11:56.507
as a cold-blooded killer,

11:56.590 --> 11:59.593
and while he is cold-blooded,
and can kill you,

11:59.677 --> 12:03.889
he's also a loving parent
and a great source of low-fat protein.

12:03.973 --> 12:08.227
Fine. I believe you. Mostly because I
don't want to listen to any more of this.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.020
Great.

12:10.104 --> 12:15.484
Now, I'm sure everyone is wondering about
the etymology of the word "bratwurst."

12:15.568 --> 12:17.278
How did you know?

12:21.532 --> 12:24.368
I think I found something!

12:24.452 --> 12:27.163
-Is this your leg again, Julius?
-<i>Not me this time!</i>

12:30.791 --> 12:34.211
-Cisco, come in! We got something!

12:34.295 --> 12:36.422
Hello? Cisco?

12:36.505 --> 12:40.426
Uh, Gary? How much oxygen do we have left?

12:49.226 --> 12:54.315
You must have been
a great shortstop in Little League.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.859
Now where's the cash?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.281
-Cut!

13:02.948 --> 13:06.702
I am obsessed with that rewrite, Cisco!

13:06.785 --> 13:09.163
Uh-oh. Gotta go! Friends drowning in tar!

13:09.663 --> 13:11.624
Now that's a pro, people!

13:15.419 --> 13:18.422
I am not in the mood
for a spy-nonsense detour

13:18.506 --> 13:21.967
after having both ears and a leg
talked off by that mustached man.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.721
Spying isn't nonsense, Mom. It's exciting!

13:25.804 --> 13:29.058
It's making me a little anxious.
We're not in danger, are we?

13:30.684 --> 13:32.811
This won't be
exciting or dangerous.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.524
I just have to check real quick
to see if anything unusual is out here.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.651
Back in a second.

13:39.151 --> 13:43.322
-Alright, Dann. What were you doing here?

13:50.746 --> 13:51.830
What's this?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.431
Okay. See? Nothing exciting here.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.309
-What was that?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.400
-Woohoo!

14:19.483 --> 14:20.859
Everyone, stay calm.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.406
I knew this was a bad idea!

14:25.489 --> 14:27.700
-Who's after us?
-An evil robot.

14:27.783 --> 14:31.912
You created an evil robot, didn't you? Why
can't you just find a nice girl to date?!

14:31.996 --> 14:33.664
I didn't, I swear!

14:36.834 --> 14:39.879
You're right, Matsuo.
This art is soothing.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.716
Now, is yellow
the best color for "immature"?

14:43.799 --> 14:46.385
I'm trying to capture Tony's essence.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.763
Sorry, Echo,
but I'm way too mature to take your bait.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.977
I call mine <i>Echo's Face</i>.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.613
I can't control this rage anymore!

15:09.825 --> 15:10.701
Oh, no.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.957
-Now don't be scared, baby.
-I'm not. I love being a spy.

15:17.041 --> 15:21.754
Plus, the most dangerous thing
about this situation is still in its cage.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.131
Where is it?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.219
I'm calling my team for backup.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.474
Nuh-uh. Cell use
while driving is dangerous.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.267
I'll call your spy team.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.062
Dang it!

15:38.604 --> 15:41.273
-What is this? Did I drop a sausage?

15:43.192 --> 15:45.861
-Snake in the car, snake in the car!

16:01.126 --> 16:02.169
I'm doing it!

16:02.252 --> 16:04.797
I'm reversing for
an extended period of time!

16:04.880 --> 16:07.466
I think I have
a really good chance of passing my test

16:07.549 --> 16:09.093
if we get out of this alive!

16:09.176 --> 16:11.178
Where are you, Professor Scaley?

16:14.264 --> 16:17.184
He's coming for revenge!
I think that sausage was his family!

16:17.267 --> 16:18.560
This is why I'm a vegan.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.402
Remember, it's more afraid of you
than you are of it.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.736
Wanna bet?!

16:40.249 --> 16:41.709
-Go, go, go!
-I'm going!

16:49.758 --> 16:52.052
-Ah, come on, Matsuo, it's us!

16:52.136 --> 16:53.929
-We're your friends!

17:03.230 --> 17:07.067
Please put your evil robot arm away
and go back to normal!

17:18.954 --> 17:22.833
Make sure not to hurt him,
or we won't be able to get any Dann intel.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.794
I'm not so concerned about
us hurting him right now!

17:39.224 --> 17:41.226
The chime! That makes him chill!

17:45.064 --> 17:46.398
Kick it over to me.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.616
Yes!

18:07.503 --> 18:09.922
Aw, man! Here goes nothing.

18:47.042 --> 18:52.339
This is the first time in two years
that I have lost control.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.676
It's okay, man.
The farting butt was on me.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.094
No.

18:57.177 --> 19:03.684
This kind of destruction is what happens
when you combine man and machine.

19:03.767 --> 19:04.893
What do you mean?

19:05.477 --> 19:08.689
When I first developed
my arm's robotic technology,

19:08.772 --> 19:12.359
I realized it would have become
corrupted over time.

19:12.442 --> 19:16.113
I warned Cleve Kelso, but he did not care.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.950
He used my accident
to weaponize me against my will,

19:20.033 --> 19:22.911
then sold my programming
to the highest bidder.

19:22.995 --> 19:28.000
Based on the threat you have described,
it may very well have been to your agency.

19:28.083 --> 19:33.589
Through meditation, I trained myself
to resist my arm's influence.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.134
But this "Dann" has a mind made of code.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.760
There is no way for her

19:38.844 --> 19:42.556
to slow the effects of
her own exponential corruption.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.975
Is there a way to deprogram her?

19:45.601 --> 19:46.602
No.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.438
She will have to be destroyed.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.357
Until then, she will become
increasingly irrational.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.444
More and more difficult to predict.

19:56.028 --> 20:01.200
Your strength will lie in
your team's ability to think and react.

20:01.283 --> 20:05.746
You two must move past
your differences and lead together,

20:05.829 --> 20:08.123
as you did when we first met.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.962
<i>Dann had all these crazy missiles flying</i>
<i>out of her suit. I managed to avoid them,</i>

20:14.046 --> 20:17.257
<i>and then at the last second Mom</i>
<i>threw a snake at her and we escaped!</i>

20:17.341 --> 20:19.092
<i>I am super grounded.</i>

20:19.676 --> 20:21.803
But wait, where did the snake come from?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.430
-Probably Sissy.
-<i>Sissy!</i>

20:24.014 --> 20:27.184
<i>I found this in the desert.</i>
<i>Dann seemed to really want it back.</i>

20:27.267 --> 20:31.480
No way. That looks exactly like
the thing Gary and Julius found!

20:32.064 --> 20:35.150
Matsuo didn't happen to tell you
what Dann's using them for, did he?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.736
No, just that
she's fritzing out, big time.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.488
Her AI is getting corrupted.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.699
We have no way of knowing
when and where she'll strike next.

20:47.704 --> 20:51.166
-Ready to bag another bounty?
-Hey, big guy.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.710
You can run, but you can't hide.

21:02.886 --> 21:03.887
It's an ambush!

21:25.701 --> 21:26.660
No!

21:38.380 --> 21:39.381
Ha ha!

21:41.508 --> 21:44.386
-You don't stand a chance, little lady.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.982
-You underestimated the wrong little lady.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.574
Dann led us here. She set us up!

22:06.158 --> 22:10.829
Every time I think I'm out,
they pull me back in.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
