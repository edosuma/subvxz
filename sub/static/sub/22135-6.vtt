WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.237
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.088
Hello, this is Dr. Roderick
Campbell. I know your team

00:20.121 --> 00:21.855
already uses
some of our resources.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.991
I would like to propose
a partnership of sorts.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.326
Listen, I appreciate the offer.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.627
I'm afraid
it's out of the question.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.197
THUNDERBIRD:
What did you do?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.265
DREAMER:
I gave her a memory.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.201
THUNDERBIRD: Do you realize
what you've done?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.202
BLINK:
Now I get to live

00:34.235 --> 00:35.436
with the memory

00:35.469 --> 00:37.271
of loving someone I barely know.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.173
Now, 7/15 started

00:39.207 --> 00:41.075
-as a peaceful protest.
-Well, your peaceful protest

00:41.109 --> 00:42.176
killed my little girl.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.544
He knows what they did to Pulse.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.645
Let's see what I can find out.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.014
JACE:
Grace wait up for me?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.382
Grace is gone.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.450
What do you mean?

00:49.483 --> 00:52.086
She died four years ago.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.188
Don't say that.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.756
ECLIPSE:
Carmen, I need information.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.925
-What do you want from me?
-The price is you.

00:57.958 --> 01:01.362
So if I call, then you do
exactly what I ask you to do.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.796
BLINK: Something's interfering
with the portal.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.798
THUNDERBIRD: Only thing I've
ever known that can disrupt

01:04.832 --> 01:06.234
mutant abilities
like that is...

01:07.235 --> 01:08.302
That's Pulse.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.171
He was my best friend.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.774
Pulse, it's me. It's John.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.276
POLARIS:
Know what this is?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.277
I don't recognize that.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.645
But this building here...

01:17.678 --> 01:18.712
You know that place?

01:18.746 --> 01:19.613
That's the Federal Building

01:19.647 --> 01:21.149
in Baton Rouge.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.751
Some people I prosecuted
were transferred there.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
-What happened to them?
-I don't know.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.655
-They disappeared.
-THUNDERBIRD: The answers

01:27.688 --> 01:29.190
about what happened to Pulse
are in that building.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.728
THUNDERBIRD:
Hi, ma'am.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.830
I'm a mutant veteran
who served in Afghanistan.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.166
My father served

01:38.199 --> 01:39.567
in the Gulf before me.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.902
A lot of men I led
were injured there.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.237
But right now we're trying
to raise money for victims

01:43.271 --> 01:44.538
of the 7/15 disaster.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.974
So, anything you could do,

01:47.007 --> 01:48.409
I'd appreciate.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.844
My father'd appreciate.
We'd all appre...

01:50.878 --> 01:52.346
Maybe another time.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.782
(sighs)

01:54.815 --> 01:57.285
You're raising money for Dallas?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.086
Is this a joke?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.521
A joke?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.122
No, it's not a joke.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.457
It's for people affected

02:03.491 --> 02:05.025
by the 7/15 incident.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.960
Affected by mutants.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.662
You got a lot of nerve.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.399
You attack this country,
and now you ask for money?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.603
Hey, I defended this country!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.605
All right? I served two tours!

02:17.638 --> 02:20.208
You have any idea
how many of us died over there?

02:20.241 --> 02:22.210
-John, John, forget about him.
-Can you believe this?

02:22.243 --> 02:23.344
This guy's blaming us
for what happened.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.345
Hey, he's an idiot.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.346
Don't let it get to you.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.249
(tires squealing)

02:29.717 --> 02:32.653
MAN (echoing faintly):
There they are.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.987
-Let's get 'em!
-What is it?

02:34.021 --> 02:36.224
Get everybody
away from the street.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.125
Everybody away! Get down!

02:38.158 --> 02:39.827
-(crowd screaming)
-Hey, muties!

02:39.860 --> 02:42.496
Fire in the hole!

02:56.744 --> 02:58.446
(woman screams)

03:00.047 --> 03:02.049
(car alarms wailing)

03:15.095 --> 03:17.097
*

03:24.738 --> 03:27.575
(knocks)

03:27.608 --> 03:30.278
Hey. Am I interrupting?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.580
No, I was just thinking.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.348
I called around about Pulse.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.216
Now, nothing firm,

03:36.250 --> 03:39.086
but there are rumors
of mutants hunting other mutants

03:39.119 --> 03:40.521
for Sentinel Services.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.290
Pulse may not be the only one.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.625
We are barely staying ahead
of humans.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.728
If they turn us against
each other, we're done.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.431
Anything more
about the Federal Building

03:50.464 --> 03:52.633
-in Baton Rouge?
-Yeah. I checked it out.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.436
Major mutant justice center
for the Southeast.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.605
Reed Strucker
worked with a judge there,

03:57.638 --> 03:59.540
so the guy might have info
on the program.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.375
If we can get in,

04:01.409 --> 04:03.243
we might be able to figure out
what the hell's going on.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.712
You mean break in?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.547
Well, they're not exactly gonna
roll out the welcome mat for us.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.216
Look, John, I know this isn't
how we usually do things,

04:09.249 --> 04:10.918
-but...
-I don't care. What they did

04:10.951 --> 04:12.586
to Pulse,
they changed their game.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.323
Maybe it's time we changed ours.

04:18.292 --> 04:21.329
Man, all these refugees.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.763
Glad we beat the rush.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.232
At least we got, like,
actual beds.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.602
You do realize we're the reason
there is a rush, right?

04:28.636 --> 04:31.339
Sentinel Services
have been freaking out over us.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.775
It's kind of all our fault.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.577
Yeah, thanks for the guilt trip.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.379
You want to give up your bed?

04:39.547 --> 04:40.948
I know.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.683
Shut up and get more water.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.151
Good boy.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.522
Hey.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.024
Are there any other flavors?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.192
Besides Salisbury steak?

04:52.225 --> 04:53.361
They're all the same.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.996
Okay, wait.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.264
You take care

04:57.297 --> 04:58.499
of refugees?

04:58.532 --> 04:59.767
What's your name?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.869
My name is "I have work to do."

05:01.902 --> 05:05.473
What if you were already done?

05:15.082 --> 05:17.250
(laughs softly)

05:19.219 --> 05:20.287
I'm Wes.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.091
Nice to meet you... Wes.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.529
(exhales)

05:28.562 --> 05:30.197
(sighs)

05:30.230 --> 05:32.700
Skyler,
your blood pressure's high.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.235
Any idea why that would be?

05:40.708 --> 05:44.077
How often do you use
your powers?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.046
I don't know.
Two or three times a day?

05:47.247 --> 05:48.716
Whenever I have to find food.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.984
That much? I...

05:51.018 --> 05:52.686
How long has that
been going on for?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.187
Couple years.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.089
Some other mutant kids and me

05:56.123 --> 05:57.891
found a place under I-85

05:57.925 --> 06:00.060
until the Sentinels
came after us.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.832
Well, I want you
to go get some food, okay?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.367
Okay.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.921
POLARIS:
Not bad.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.923
Have you ever trained?

06:29.957 --> 06:31.358
Not really.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.960
You're training now.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.394
They'll get you some clothes
downstairs.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.898
Uh, excuse me.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.433
You're planning to train
all these kids

06:39.467 --> 06:40.601
for what, exactly?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.202
Combat.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.971
-(chuckles) Seriously?
-Yeah.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.272
They're being hunted.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.840
Seemed more relevant
than knitting.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.482
(Zingo panting)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.349
THUNDERBIRD:
Clarice.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.453
There's a Federal Building

06:59.487 --> 07:01.254
in Baton Rouge
that we need to get into.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.124
I know it's a lot to ask,
but we think

07:04.157 --> 07:05.826
there might be information
in there

07:05.859 --> 07:08.095
about Sentinel Services
and what they did to Pulse.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.063
So, is that all?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.665
That's all we need
to talk about?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.469
You need the 411
on your old Marine buddy,

07:15.503 --> 07:17.905
so I just blink you
into a building?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.307
I'm just a portable door-maker?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.075
-(scoffs)
-Fine.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.844
If you're not gonna
bring it up, I will.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.347
Your friend Dreamer
stuck a memory in my head

07:27.380 --> 07:28.682
without mentioning it to me

07:28.716 --> 07:30.317
or, I don't know,
asking my permission.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.953
A memory that I'm sure
you're familiar with

07:32.986 --> 07:34.287
because it's a memory of you.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.590
All right.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.291
I'm sorry.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.261
-I asked her not to do that,
but... -But when she did,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.531
-you decided not to say anything
about it. -It was an emergency.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.265
She did it to save the team.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.468
And afterwards,
we still needed your help.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.671
Oh. Ah, I get it.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.473
You didn't want to tell me
because you wanted to use me.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.176
FYI, you're not making this
any better.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.611
I've got my own issues
to sort out.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.446
My own people to find.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.515
Hey.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.050
Maybe-maybe I can help you

08:03.083 --> 08:04.918
-do this.
-I'm not asking for your help.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.022
I just want to know.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.624
When we were

08:10.658 --> 08:12.626
working together
in the warehouse

08:12.660 --> 08:13.827
and we were alone...

08:13.861 --> 08:16.463
The way you looked at me.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.599
Was that real?

08:22.770 --> 08:25.539
Um, it's complicated.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.515
-(sighs)
-Well, lucky you.

08:37.785 --> 08:41.088
I'm gonna help make this
a lot less complicated.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.558
(Zingo whimpers)

08:44.592 --> 08:47.394
Clarice, come on. (sighs)

08:49.429 --> 08:50.530
Clarice!

08:54.034 --> 08:56.036
(exhales)

09:02.309 --> 09:05.713
Listen, everybody needs
to understand something here.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.781
This isn't just about
hiding mutants anymore.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.917
We are taking the fight
to the enemy now.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.585
It's a matter of survival.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.622
Reed, can you tell us
about this building?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.057
REED: I wish I knew more.
Some of my cases

09:17.090 --> 09:18.692
were transferred to Baton Rouge.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.762
There's a judge there,
James Kresge.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.263
He dealt
with most of my cases.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.698
And how many folks
you prosecuted disappeared

09:24.732 --> 09:26.366
-through this place?
-It was rare.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.235
All they told me
was that some of my cases

09:28.268 --> 09:30.804
were being prosecuted
under a special federal program.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.740
And you never asked
for more information why?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.307
We're not debating this.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.476
Look, what matters now
is getting those files.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.211
If Clarice can get us in,
then...

09:38.245 --> 09:39.913
That's not an option.
Clarice, uh...

09:39.947 --> 09:41.381
she left.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.050
-She's gone.
-POLARIS: What, she just left?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.785
-Why would she do that?
-DREAMER: It doesn't matter.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.286
We need another solution.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.892
I could try to get us
into the back of the building.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.560
That's reinforced concrete.
Cutting through this

09:53.593 --> 09:54.928
is gonna take
at least half an hour.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.463
Then I'll have to do it
a lot faster.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.666
-It's not possible.
-ANDY: I can get us through.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.134
Andy.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.435
What? It's a wall.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.904
I can handle a wall,
no problem.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.973
You and I should talk

10:06.006 --> 10:07.975
-about this when... -Are we
really gonna do this again?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.910
Talk about how only the adults
can do anything?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.012
You said it yourself. It's
a matter of survival, right?

10:12.045 --> 10:13.747
Yeah, so, if the Sentinel
Services did track us down,

10:13.781 --> 10:14.982
the kids would be
just as screwed

10:15.015 --> 10:16.016
as the adults, if not more.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.250
I can get us through that wall

10:17.284 --> 10:18.485
quicker than anybody else here.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.021
It's time you let me fight.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.764
Pee bucket.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.999
-Scalpel.
-(chuckles)

10:38.405 --> 10:40.674
You okay with this?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.342
Bringing Andy?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.845
I don't know. Maybe...
maybe it's a good thing.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.347
We haven't been connecting

10:47.380 --> 10:48.716
since I got out of prison.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.284
Oh. Nothing says
"father-son bonding"

10:51.318 --> 10:53.320
like breaking into
a federal building.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.621
This is our best shot.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.989
I get it.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.657
Doesn't mean I like it.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.295
Hey. Be careful, all right?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.864
I wish I could be there.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.566
Yeah, I'll miss you, too.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.569
Look, John, we got this.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.238
And you're needed here.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.742
We'll be okay.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.410
All right.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.249
Stuff's all loaded.
Are we ready?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.418
Andy, stay close to your dad.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.987
ANDY:
Not like I have a choice.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.555
We're gonna be stuck
inside that truck.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.558
See ya.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.694
Hey.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.569
They took my wedding ring.
In prison.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.704
I'm sorry.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.875
We haven't even talked...

11:47.908 --> 11:49.509
I know, I know.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.711
We will.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.385
Just come back safe.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.726
Everything okay?

12:08.996 --> 12:12.465
Just watching my dad and brother
get ready to leave.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.734
It's weird. Three weeks ago,

12:14.768 --> 12:18.405
our craziest family outing
was... Six Flags.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.309
I'm sure they'll be fine.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.413
I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.082
Do you, uh...

12:29.116 --> 12:30.583
do you want to talk about it?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.654
Maybe another time.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.190
Should get back to work.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.131
-(elevator dings, opens)
-WEEKS: Whoa. Hey.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.666
Agent Turner,
what are you doing here?

12:46.699 --> 12:48.902
-You're not supposed to be here.
-You know what it's like to lose

12:48.936 --> 12:50.137
your only daughter twice?

12:50.170 --> 12:51.638
You have no idea
what I've been through.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.073
What are you looking at, Suarez?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.474
Jace.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.109
When was the last time
you slept?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.777
-You're in no condition
to be at work. -Where else

12:57.811 --> 13:00.680
-would I be? -You're
on a mandatory leave of absence.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.283
Everybody's heart broke
for you and for Paula.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.353
But you're not supposed
to be here.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.991
(beep, click)

13:11.024 --> 13:13.827
You gonna call security?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.795
Tell 'em I'll be in my office.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.031
(handle turns, door opens)

13:36.749 --> 13:38.751
-(exhales)
-(phone beeps)

13:41.654 --> 13:43.656
-(clears throat)
-(line ringing)

13:45.825 --> 13:49.062
I need to speak to Dr. Campbell.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.368
ECLIPSE: You guys might want
to get some rest.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.505
We've got a long ride
to Baton Rouge.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.707
ANDY: Maybe later.
(beatboxing)

14:02.775 --> 14:05.412
I haven't heard you do that
for a while.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.248
Yeah.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.918
Guys at school used to think
it was weird.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.257
We didn't get a chance to talk
about what was going on

14:17.290 --> 14:18.425
for you at school.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.193
You know, I tried to help.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.529
I went to see
your guidance counselor.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.532
Yeah, I know. You know that's...

14:25.565 --> 14:27.700
the whole reason those guys
came after me

14:27.734 --> 14:29.569
that night in the gym, right?

14:33.974 --> 14:37.377
I wish you'd talked to me
about it.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.379
Before it got that bad.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.214
Like when?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.150
At midnight, when you got home?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.354
Maybe there's a chance
we can talk about it now.

14:47.387 --> 14:52.425
Now, when we're in the back of
a hot truck, peeing in a bucket.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.727
(chuckles softly) I don't think
we should let the pee bucket

14:54.761 --> 14:57.297
-come between us, huh?
-(chuckles) -(siren whoops)

14:57.330 --> 14:58.365
Listen, I just...

14:58.398 --> 14:59.732
(siren whoops)

14:59.766 --> 15:00.968
OFFICER (over speaker):
Pull over.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.770
(brakes squeak, hiss)

15:03.803 --> 15:04.904
(whispering):
Cops.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.239
Quiet.

15:08.775 --> 15:12.379
-License and registration.
-Yeah, sure.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.914
(exhales)

15:19.252 --> 15:21.221
OFFICER: Gonna need you
to open the back up.

15:21.254 --> 15:25.825
THOMAS: Just... some relocation
boxes for some sales VP.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.295
Well, I'm gonna need to see 'em.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.730
(chuckles)

15:30.763 --> 15:34.601
I'm-I'm really running late
to Denver.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.336
OFFICER: Your name showed up
on a list we got

15:36.369 --> 15:38.271
from Sentinel Services.
Let's go.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.240
If he tries to come in,
I can fight him off.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.741
Fight him off? Absolutely not.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.643
Shh. Both of you,
turn off the lights.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.012
I might be able to hide us.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.646
REED:
There's nowhere to go.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.515
I absorb light before I emit it.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.650
If I can absorb enough...

15:50.683 --> 15:51.684
OFFICER: ...then you got nothing
to worry about...

15:51.718 --> 15:53.686
Stay quiet.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.788
OFFICER: Any, uh,
agricultural products?

15:55.822 --> 15:58.125
(muffled, indistinct chatter)

15:59.526 --> 16:00.927
(sighs)

16:00.960 --> 16:02.629
OFFICER:
That's a long haul to Denver.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.564
You making any stops?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.142
OFFICER: Anything back here
I should know about?

16:15.175 --> 16:18.045
THOMAS: Just, uh... just hate
that I'm gonna be so late.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.379
OFFICER:
Open it.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.167
(straining)

16:46.339 --> 16:47.907
DISPATCHER:
Unit 17, we have a call

16:47.940 --> 16:49.242
at mile marker 51.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.678
Officer requesting assistance.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.681
Copy that, I'll be en route.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.218
Okay. Drive safe.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.853
Thank you.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.457
(groaning)

17:17.204 --> 17:19.806
(sighs, groans)

17:22.442 --> 17:24.211
Maybe a little to the left.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.679
Figured it was time

17:26.713 --> 17:27.680
we started thinking about

17:27.714 --> 17:29.249
reinforcing this place.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.451
So, you never told me,

17:31.484 --> 17:33.720
how did your conversation go
with Clarice?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.855
She left.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.258
So I'd say not well.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.693
It's about par for the course
these days.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.895
If you're talking about Pulse,
that wasn't your fault.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.232
How do you figure that?
I left him.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.933
I let Sentinel Services
take him.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.868
-You thought he was dead.
-I was wrong.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.570
I should've saved him.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.139
I'm starting to think that
maybe the X-Men made a mistake--

17:52.172 --> 17:53.906
choosing me to be
part of the underground.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.377
Johnny, you can't think
that way.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.279
I know you want to live up to
who your father was,

17:59.312 --> 18:00.747
but you're doing all you can.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.715
It's not enough.
We have more refugees in there

18:02.749 --> 18:04.117
than we can possibly save.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.253
I can barely protect
a bunch of veterans.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.887
You were chosen for a reason.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.423
The X-Men said a war is coming.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.793
They didn't say we'd win.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.832
So, we're definitely staying
tonight, though, right?

18:19.866 --> 18:21.834
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.073
(indistinct conversation)

18:27.106 --> 18:30.610
Looks like we're here
through tomorrow.

18:30.643 --> 18:35.448
Guess there are a lot
of police on the road.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.950
(sighs)

18:37.984 --> 18:41.854
We always used to talk about
going camping.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.492
And here we are...
the wilderness.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.959
(laughs)

18:46.993 --> 18:48.328
Maybe we could go swimming
in that puddle

18:48.361 --> 18:50.129
behind the bathrooms later.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.735
May I ask you something?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.806
Does it hurt...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.608
when you use your power?

19:01.641 --> 19:05.978
Um, not really. Why?

19:06.012 --> 19:09.349
I was watching Marcos earlier,
and...

19:09.382 --> 19:12.051
I saw how much
it took out of him.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.486
It's not really like that
for me.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.322
It's more like... yelling.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.724
Y-You know, you have to put
something into it,

19:17.757 --> 19:21.328
but it's not, like...
it's worth it when it happens.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.163
Actually feels kinda good

19:24.197 --> 19:26.999
when I rip stuff apart.

19:27.033 --> 19:30.237
-Just forget it.
-No, Andy...

19:30.270 --> 19:32.205
Sorry. I...
(sighs)

19:32.239 --> 19:34.641
It's just that what you do,

19:34.674 --> 19:37.176
you know,
it could hurt someone.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.011
Kill someone.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.980
So I'm just supposed to sit
around and never use my power?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.649
I'm finally good at something,

19:42.682 --> 19:44.551
and you're just telling me
not to do it.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.985
I just want you
to be proud of me.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.087
All I want you to do is
use good judgment.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.024
Reed? Our driver has a question
about tomorrow's route.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.860
Uh-uh, okay, I just...
Andy and I just need a second.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.564
No, it-it's fine. I'm going
to get something to eat.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.241
(sighs)

20:15.748 --> 20:18.751
-Something you're looking for?
-Oh...

20:18.785 --> 20:20.420
John said I might find some
schoolbooks in here,

20:20.453 --> 20:22.422
but I'm not sure how
it's organized.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.923
Well, it's not.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.224
Stuff just kinda piled up.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.361
Right. Well,

20:28.395 --> 20:31.130
we could start
a nifty thrift shop.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.632
(laughs)
Here.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.066
I think this is what
you're looking for.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.035
What are you going to do
with them?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.970
I want to get a school started
for Andy and Lauren.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.872
For all the refugee kids.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.141
How did you get these books?

20:42.174 --> 20:43.976
Sentinel Services like
to grab families

20:44.010 --> 20:46.446
when they're picking the kids up
from school.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.316
Get them all at once.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.852
-(Shatter grunts)
-(door opens)

20:54.321 --> 20:56.956
Okay, guys, just remember,

20:56.989 --> 20:59.225
in the real world,
you'll be playing for keeps.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.295
Which means we play
for keeps in here.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.438
-You ready?
-Uh-huh.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.675
Three, two...

21:18.445 --> 21:20.447
POLARIS:
Not bad.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.388
-I'll go next.
-Okay.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.064
You think this is a joke?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.502
Whatever.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.538
You guys don't understand.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.973
You're going to need
to depend on each other

21:47.006 --> 21:48.107
just to survive.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.042
You wanna make it out there?

21:50.076 --> 21:53.212
You gotta work hard in here.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.313
Lauren, you're up next.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.683
Uh...

21:56.716 --> 21:57.984
What do you think you're doing?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.386
That's my daughter.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.554
Yeah, and she's training
right now.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.155
-Uh... (laughs)
-If this hits you,

22:03.189 --> 22:04.724
it's going to hurt--
you might want to step back.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.460
Step back? I don't recall
giving you permission

22:07.494 --> 22:09.295
to hurl saw blades at my kid.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.330
(quietly):
Mom!

22:11.364 --> 22:13.900
What, do you want her to get
a learner's permit?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.535
She's got powers.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.303
She needs to know
how to use them.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.638
Well, not like this.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.707
Sorry, Lauren.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.874
Mom, please.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.342
Let's go.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.983
ECLIPSE:
Hey.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.152
I didn't mean
to eavesdrop before.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.423
But I heard you
talking about his powers.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.825
Yeah. Not sure
I did a great job, there.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.560
Keep at it.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.162
It'll be easier for him
if he has someone to talk to.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.131
Especially his father.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.804
Did you always want to be a dad?

22:55.041 --> 22:57.009
Yeah.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.811
Yeah, I guess I did.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.584
You're gonna be a father.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.019
How 'bout you?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.555
(sighs)

23:08.588 --> 23:12.224
I don't know.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.561
I didn't know my dad
much, really,

23:14.594 --> 23:18.030
even before he kicked me out
for being a mutant.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.266
I was the oldest.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.802
Supposed to run the family
business, make him look good.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.839
Safe to say I disappointed him.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.581
Listen, if we all turned out
just like our fathers,

23:34.614 --> 23:37.617
I wouldn't
be much of a dad myself.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.119
Yeah.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.592
Then how'd you figure it out?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.760
You know, parenting.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.931
I haven't.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.268
But I can tell you this.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.240
Nothing that they can do
would make you love 'em less.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.977
You start there and then...

24:05.011 --> 24:07.346
you do the best you can.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.360
Agent Turner.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.862
I've reached out to some friends

24:22.895 --> 24:25.532
on Capitol Hill
to get you reinstated

24:25.565 --> 24:28.367
-and reassure them that you are
committed to the cause. -Really?

24:29.401 --> 24:30.770
Thank you.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.839
One more thing.
Uh, we discussed

24:32.872 --> 24:35.441
the Strucker children in
one of our early conversations,

24:35.474 --> 24:38.010
-if you recall.
-Yeah, I remember.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.980
At the time,
that information was restricted.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.949
Well, I trust now that we're
working together, it won't

24:42.982 --> 24:45.117
be a problem for me
to access their files.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.887
Of course, I can call back
my friends in Washington

24:47.920 --> 24:49.556
and tell them you're not ready.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.658
JACE:
No, that won't be necessary.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.459
Good. Whatever you have.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.627
Send it to my office.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.896
I'll send it right over.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.064
Well, in that case...

25:00.332 --> 25:01.768
...let's get to work.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.574
(door closes)

25:13.680 --> 25:16.415
ECLIPSE: Hey, babe. So we got to
the courthouse in Baton Rouge,

25:16.448 --> 25:19.185
and it's a little more
well-protected than we thought.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.053
(sighs)
How little is "little"?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.922
Uh, we had to find
a different entry point.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.156
Andy thinks he can get us in
through the parking garage

25:24.190 --> 25:25.391
of the building next door.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.726
It shares a wall
with the courthouse.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.927
You sure the kid's not gonna

25:27.960 --> 25:29.028
bring down the entire building?

25:29.061 --> 25:30.262
Well, he's green, but

25:30.296 --> 25:31.330
he can handle it.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.199
Be careful, all right?

25:33.232 --> 25:35.167
I will.
How's the baby?

25:35.201 --> 25:37.336
(chuckles) Oh, what,
you miss the kid already?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.205
I could send you a picture of me
throwing up in the morning,

25:39.238 --> 25:42.374
-if you want. -Hey,
I'll take it. Love you, babe.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.043
Love you.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.114
(indistinct conversations)

25:48.147 --> 25:49.448
(sighs)

25:49.481 --> 25:50.583
Lorna.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.521
I know you're trying
to help these kids.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.058
But isn't the idea
to give these people a future?

25:59.091 --> 26:00.793
Lives after the fighting?

26:00.827 --> 26:02.394
Yeah, it's a nice idea.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.631
But they might be fighting
the rest of their lives.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.198
That's not what I want
for my kids.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.201
Look, what your kids can do--

26:09.235 --> 26:11.303
it's way beyond
what we usually see.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.139
Their power is incredible.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.240
Okay? They need to develop...

26:14.273 --> 26:17.109
They need some sort of normalcy.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.544
They're mutants.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.312
This--

26:20.346 --> 26:22.348
this is their new normal.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.994
LAUREN:
Where are we going?

26:35.027 --> 26:37.997
Office furniture graveyard.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.632
It's cool, right?

26:44.370 --> 26:45.872
Come hang for a sec.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.475
I told my mom I'd be right back.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.678
You will.
You're just taking a break.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.585
Anyway...

26:59.618 --> 27:01.153
What was up with her?

27:01.187 --> 27:04.356
She did not like us training
with Magnet Girl.

27:04.390 --> 27:07.459
I don't know.

27:07.493 --> 27:11.330
-She's still weird
about my powers. -Hmm.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.399
She didn't even know what I was
until a few weeks ago.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.535
Nobody did.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.605
Wait, so...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.574
so you've just been hiding?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.012
Why?

27:27.479 --> 27:30.316
Haven't you ever
wanted a normal life?

27:30.349 --> 27:33.285
Honestly, though, what you did--

27:33.319 --> 27:35.688
hiding who you were
all that time--

27:35.722 --> 27:37.356
that sounds worse.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.127
It sucked.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.563
Pretending like
everything was great.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.465
Counting down the days
till graduation

27:46.498 --> 27:48.467
so I could move to...

27:48.500 --> 27:50.036
Florence.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.905
Or something.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.709
I guess that's
never gonna happen.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.690
Welcome to Florence.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.061
Wow.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.665
Even the water's moving.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.601
Yeah, I-I've...
never done that before.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.273
I think you're making me better.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.512
One thing, though--

28:33.545 --> 28:35.114
isn't this Rome?

28:36.315 --> 28:38.117
I think that's the Vatican.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.685
-Oh.
-(laughs)

28:39.718 --> 28:41.087
Oh, well...

28:41.120 --> 28:43.555
My bad. I, um, I just saw it
on a commercial.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.728
It's beautiful.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.231
Mm-hmm.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.868
CAITLIN (in distance):
Lauren!

28:55.902 --> 28:57.203
Lauren!

28:57.236 --> 28:58.737
I should go.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.282
Most of the building's
sealed off,

29:10.316 --> 29:12.118
so it'll take 'em longer
to get to us.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.419
It'll still be tight, though.

29:15.687 --> 29:18.624
You can break that wall,
we're in.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.893
Okay, kid. You're up.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.929
Let's do this.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.805
(wall creaking)

29:36.442 --> 29:37.877
(grunts)

29:41.013 --> 29:42.882
(car alarms wailing)

29:47.519 --> 29:48.988
Andy, Andy, what are you doing?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.656
You gotta get back
to the truck.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.458
Did you see that?
I can rock this.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.626
We do not have time for this.
We have to get in there now.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.396
Stick to the plan. Go.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.633
ECLIPSE:
Let's go.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.216
(whispering):
It's this one.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.321
(fire alarm starts beeping)

30:25.858 --> 30:27.359
ECLIPSE:
Hurry up, get the mutant files.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.766
Okay, I've got them.

30:38.604 --> 30:39.805
You done, there?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.473
Yeah.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.009
Yeah, that's everything.
You get the hard drives?

30:43.042 --> 30:44.576
ECLIPSE:
It's gonna take a minute.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.178
Won't do us any good
if I melt them.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.215
(tires screech in distance)

30:49.248 --> 30:51.550
AGENT (in distance):
Come on, let's go!

30:51.583 --> 30:53.385
-Second floor! Let's go!
-Go, go.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.553
They're coming.
How much longer?

30:54.586 --> 30:56.989
I'm almost in.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.091
Here we go.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.259
Got 'em.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.660
We need to go, now.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.530
Come on! Come on.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.332
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.167
-Covering our tracks.
-You can't.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.203
I can't what? These people
are trying to kill us, man.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.738
You want to leave 'em
a thank-you note?

31:24.650 --> 31:26.252
THUNDERBIRD:
Hey.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.254
Just got word from HQ
in Alpharetta.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.089
-What happened-- they get hit?
-Yeah.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.224
They managed to get about
half of their people out.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.859
They're on their way here now.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.861
Here?
We're already over capacity

31:35.894 --> 31:37.529
-by at least 78%.
-Yeah, well,

31:37.563 --> 31:40.132
that number's
about to get a lot worse.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.068
Guys, I'm sorry.
We don't have a choice here.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.103
We need to do something.
We got to find space for 'em.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.272
-Okay. -You got it.
-All right.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.378
(Thunderbird sighs)

31:52.411 --> 31:54.280
Hey.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.282
Are you all right?

31:56.315 --> 31:57.449
Yeah.

31:57.483 --> 31:58.917
Yeah, I'm all right.

31:58.951 --> 32:02.154
How'd it go with Marcos
in Baton Rouge?

32:02.188 --> 32:04.123
They got what
they went there for.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.392
Without Clarice?
I guess not everything

32:06.425 --> 32:08.127
requires a portal.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.728
(exhales)

32:09.761 --> 32:11.463
What you did...

32:11.497 --> 32:14.300
what we did to her,
it was wrong.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.935
Was it?
Because it saved lives.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.405
We kept the truth from her.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.906
If we had told her earlier,

32:20.939 --> 32:22.908
she would have left earlier,

32:22.941 --> 32:24.910
and people would have died.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.113
(softly):
Johnny...

32:27.146 --> 32:29.748
it's okay.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.985
It's okay that you made it out
and Pulse didn't.

32:33.019 --> 32:36.022
You have to keep moving forward.

32:42.694 --> 32:46.198
*

32:46.232 --> 32:47.766
We can't do this.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.001
Why not?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.302
Because...

32:50.336 --> 32:52.838
Because we're in a war?

32:52.871 --> 32:56.708
That just means all we have
is here and now.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.785
(phone ringing)

33:06.818 --> 33:08.987
(whispers):
It's Marcos.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.760
Uh...

33:17.096 --> 33:18.497
Where are you?

33:18.530 --> 33:19.798
MARCOS:
We're almost back.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.200
THUNDERBIRD (over phone):
That's good.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.668
-Yeah, I'm not so sure it is.
-ANDY: He's still there.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.203
-Two cars back.
-We've had a cop

33:24.236 --> 33:25.737
trailing us
the last couple miles.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.473
No sirens, but something
doesn't feel right.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.741
-Has anything come up
on the scanners? -No, nothing.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.912
He's on his radio.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.247
Check the traffic agency
public notices

33:35.281 --> 33:36.715
to see if there's any directives

33:36.748 --> 33:38.350
to avoid Buford Highway.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.852
REED:
Is there anything?

33:40.886 --> 33:43.855
Uh...

33:43.889 --> 33:45.057
Yeah.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.493
THUNDERBIRD:
Yeah, there is.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.528
They know we're coming.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.766
They're heading
straight into a police ambush.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.668
We think it'll happen here.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.404
LAUREN: Why can't they just go
somewhere else?

33:58.437 --> 34:00.106
There's no place to go.
They're hemmed in.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.873
How did this happen?
I thought they got away.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.275
-I-I thought that...
-The cops stopped them

34:03.309 --> 34:04.410
on the way up there.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.844
They didn't find anything,

34:05.877 --> 34:07.413
but the driver
said he was going to Denver,

34:07.446 --> 34:09.448
so when the tollway cameras
in Baton Rouge spotted them...

34:09.481 --> 34:11.483
Well, how do we get them out of
there? We can't just leave them.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.886
Wes can help.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.022
You saw him at training.
He can make illusions,

34:17.055 --> 34:18.124
mirages,
if they need to get away

34:18.157 --> 34:19.458
from the police.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.726
That could work.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.060
I'll go get him.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.795
I want to go, too.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.599
If it doesn't work out,
you'll need me.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.238
Go.

34:32.271 --> 34:35.073
Go, before I change my mind.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.251
Okay, we're coming.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.253
We'll have eyes on you
in a second.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.221
ECLIPSE (over phone): I don't
want you guys getting caught.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.822
Trust me.
We'll stay out of sight, okay?

34:50.856 --> 34:52.258
ECLIPSE:
Remember,

34:52.291 --> 34:53.592
we don't know for sure
the cops are onto us.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.593
It might be nothing.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.794
-Bad news.
-(siren wailing)

34:55.827 --> 34:57.496
It's not nothing.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.965
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:05.103 --> 35:07.072
We're in position.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.908
-(siren wailing) -Contact
in approximately two minutes.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.943
POLARIS:
They're here.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.779
We can't turn around.
They're right behind us.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.351
Marcos, tell the driver
to keep going.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.953
You understand? Do not stop.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.622
We'll handle the rest.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.457
Are you sure?

35:25.491 --> 35:28.394
Trust me.

35:30.862 --> 35:31.930
Polaris has a plan.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.165
(knocking on truck cab)

35:33.199 --> 35:34.600
ECLIPSE:
Thomas, whatever happens

35:34.633 --> 35:37.469
in front of you,
just keep driving.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.338
LAUREN: How are they gonna
get through that roadblock?

35:40.572 --> 35:42.641
Your shields.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.176
They strong enough for a truck

35:44.210 --> 35:45.877
to drive over?

35:45.911 --> 35:47.513
I don't know. I've never tried.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.780
You just need to focus.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.115
You don't think about anything.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.184
Forget about everything
but the target.

35:52.218 --> 35:53.719
I'll tell you when.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.387
After that, it's all you.

35:55.421 --> 35:58.290
I've never done anything
that big.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.492
Then dig deeper.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.567
POLARIS:
Here it comes.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.238
Stop the vehicle immediately,

36:12.271 --> 36:15.374
or we will open fire.
This is Sentinel Services.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.343
So, we're just gonna sit in here
and do nothing?

36:17.376 --> 36:18.544
We need to stay calm.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.178
Dad, they said they were
gonna kill us!

36:20.212 --> 36:21.380
-We've got a plan.
-But I can help!

36:23.882 --> 36:25.083
Keep it together, kid.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.318
REED:
Andy, listen to me.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.486
We know you can help.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.820
You've already proven that.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.490
Your power is not
the answer to everything.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.691
Right now,

36:32.724 --> 36:36.027
the answer
is for us to be a team.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.168
Okay?

36:43.201 --> 36:45.070
WEEKS: I repeat,
stop the vehicle immediately,

36:45.103 --> 36:46.572
or we will open fire.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.740
This is Sentinel Services.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.777
Wait for it.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.417
Wait for it.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.186
Prepare to open fire.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.655
(guns clicking, men shouting)

37:10.462 --> 37:12.063
-(engine revs)
-Fire!

37:19.237 --> 37:20.238
-POLARIS: Now.
-(grunts)

37:30.248 --> 37:32.117
(truck creaking)

37:36.588 --> 37:38.957
(grunting)

37:40.191 --> 37:41.593
You okay?

37:42.628 --> 37:45.063
Andy?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.932
(whoops)

37:46.965 --> 37:48.600
WEEKS:
Go!

37:48.634 --> 37:49.968
All units, in pursuit!

37:50.001 --> 37:51.603
-(shouting)
-Move, move, move!

37:51.637 --> 37:53.305
POLARIS:
Wes, now!

38:00.779 --> 38:02.714
-Go! Go!
-(tires screeching)

38:08.454 --> 38:10.422
(sirens wailing)

38:10.456 --> 38:12.491
(tires screeching)

38:12.524 --> 38:14.393
What if they follow
the right truck?

38:19.197 --> 38:21.066
What truck?
(chuckles)

38:24.870 --> 38:27.839
(panting)

38:37.983 --> 38:39.284
JACE: All right, everybody,
listen up.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.819
We believe that the mutants
from the roadblock

38:40.852 --> 38:42.554
were part of the same cell

38:42.588 --> 38:44.890
that broke into the federal
building in Baton Rouge.

38:44.923 --> 38:48.427
They stole vital
classified information...

38:51.229 --> 38:53.999
...and we are going
to hunt them down.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.568
I want surveillance
on all cell phones

38:56.602 --> 38:59.004
within a 50-mile radius
of the roadblock site.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.640
Monitor target names, keywords,
repeated phrases,

39:01.673 --> 39:03.675
anything that sounds
like coded communication.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.677
SS TECH:
What numbers?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.380
-What'd you say?
-I said "what numbers."

39:08.414 --> 39:10.649
-All of them. Was I unclear?
-But without a court order...

39:10.682 --> 39:12.217
-But according to the...
-I don't give a damn

39:12.250 --> 39:13.885
about a court order,
I want it done!

39:20.358 --> 39:23.128
-Any questions?
-WOMAN (quietly): No, sir.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.568
Get to work.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.778
-Mm.
-Hey.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.246
That looks
like a good dinner, there.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.614
(laughs)

39:42.648 --> 39:46.051
You put in just
the right amount of water.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.353
-Not my first can of soup.
-(laughs softly)

39:48.386 --> 39:49.788
Takes me back to law school.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.122
Really?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.525
This is just like law school.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.561
(laughs)

40:01.099 --> 40:03.802
I missed you, while you were
on your road trip.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.370
Yeah?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.705
(gasps)

40:06.738 --> 40:08.139
I got you something.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.878
There's a storage room
with a bunch of old stuff and...

40:12.911 --> 40:14.379
Wow.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.715
I thought this might work
as a replacement.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.216
-It's beautiful.
-Mm-hmm.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.885
It reminded me of you.
(chuckles)

40:19.918 --> 40:22.120
What do you think?

40:43.842 --> 40:46.144
Maybe we could have
that talk now.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.714
Maybe you should
talk to him first.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.890
CAITLIN:
Mm.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.135
REED:
Hey.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.808
Let me make something clear.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.749
I have always been proud of you.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.118
Always.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.320
You hear me?

41:30.355 --> 41:32.357
Yeah.

41:36.528 --> 41:40.465
Whatever it is that you're
thinking, you can tell me.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.433
I want to hear.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.071
No matter what.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.942
I'm thinking...

41:57.048 --> 41:59.450
...you should be the shoe.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.691
Of course.

42:05.724 --> 42:07.693
I'm always the shoe.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.528
Yeah.

Hello?

CARMEN (over phone):
It's me.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.264
Catch you at a bad time?

43:19.297 --> 43:21.466
Carmen? What do you want?

43:21.499 --> 43:23.101
I'm collecting on our agreement.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.570
I call, you come.
Remember, mi amor?

43:25.603 --> 43:27.739
I helped you rescue
your magnet girl.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.507
Time for you to pay me back.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.877
And if you don't, my next call
is to Sentinel Services.
