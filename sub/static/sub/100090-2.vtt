WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:10.140
- Hey, how'd it go with
the lawyer?

00:10.184 --> 00:12.142
- Yeah, pretty straightforward.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.404
Um, state's attorney
is moving forward

00:13.448 --> 00:15.015
on the obstruction charges.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.451
There's no trial date set
or anything,

00:16.494 --> 00:19.410
but the lawyer thinks it'll
happen sometime next year.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.891
- Then don't do anything
stupid between now and then.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.371
- I'll do my best.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.027
Hey, listen, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.203
- Huh?
- Um...

00:32.554 --> 00:35.513
Can a cop choose to be
in general population?

00:38.299 --> 00:41.258
I mean, if I lose,
I don't know--

00:41.302 --> 00:43.130
I don't know how well
I'll do

00:43.173 --> 00:45.567
23 hours a day alone
in my cell.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.527
- Uh, well, we'll talk about
that down the road

00:49.571 --> 00:51.138
if we need to.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.494
- Yeah, um, is Kev all right?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.496
I've been reaching out to him,

01:01.539 --> 01:03.846
and, uh, he's gone silent
on me.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.631
- Yeah, he's working a case.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.894
- All right.
All right, thanks, boss.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.114
- Yeah.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.727
- I don't think women
understand how hard it is

01:15.771 --> 01:17.077
to be a man these days.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.556
Think about it, bro.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.254
We've got to be
the bread-winning alpha dogs,

01:20.297 --> 01:22.343
we've got to be strong, but we
also got to be sensitive.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.474
- Right.
- Right?

01:23.518 --> 01:24.736
- Mm-hmm.
- Understanding.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.390
Pretend like we want
to change the world.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.870
That's a paradox, Peanut.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.132
- See, there you go again

01:29.176 --> 01:30.829
trying to show off
with all them big words.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.179
- Come on, man,
all I'm trying to say is--

01:32.222 --> 01:33.963
- Contradictory.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.139
I know,
but trust me,

01:36.183 --> 01:37.967
no woman is asking you
to save the world,

01:38.010 --> 01:40.970
and no good one is asking you
to pay her bills.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.277
Look, just end of the day,
it's simple, okay?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.017
We're just asking you
to be nice.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.758
- Girl got a good point.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.283
Ain't nothing paradoxical
about that neither.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.895
- We is gonna find you a book.
- Man, shut up.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.766
- You're always clowning.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.725
No wonder you two fools
are broke.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.295
Oh, so you're planning
what exactly, Kevin?

02:01.338 --> 02:02.948
- Don't worry about all that,
Dre.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.690
- It's Andre.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.953
-  Don't worry
about all that, Andre.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.434
Just know I'm working off
of big things, bro.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.133
- Big things?
- Atwater's losing his touch.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.265
It's been two weeks and Andre
still can't stand him.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
- Andre needs
a new line of work

02:16.658 --> 02:18.747
'cause that dude is
always moody.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.444
- Working for Darius Walker
will do that to you.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.142
- I told you, man.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.492
His mother and my mother grew
up next door to each other.

02:24.535 --> 02:27.016
Now that's family, bro.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.108
- D, you good?

02:38.027 --> 02:41.161
- Man, Darius got that look.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.727
- What look is that?

02:42.771 --> 02:45.817
- One that says
stay the hell away.

02:45.861 --> 02:46.818
- Nina.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.697
- Yo, what happened?

02:57.351 --> 02:59.266
- Smokey's gone.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.615
- What you mean?

03:00.658 --> 03:02.486
- He's dead.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.662
Someone shot him, man.

03:04.706 --> 03:08.362
Took his buy money too.
20 grand.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.364
- You think Garcia--
- I don't know.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.238
You know anything about this?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.285
- Excuse me?

03:18.328 --> 03:19.634
- You've been hanging
around the bar,

03:19.677 --> 03:21.331
you've been asking
a whole bunch of questions,

03:21.375 --> 03:23.246
then one of our own
gets robbed and killed.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.944
- Andre, you don't got
to like me, bro,

03:25.988 --> 03:27.903
but what you ain't gonna do
is accuse me of anything.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.513
- Kev, you've got
to be careful, bro.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.949
- Careful about what?

03:30.993 --> 03:32.516
- I ain't seen your ass
in ten years,

03:32.560 --> 03:34.344
then you just show up,
trying to reconnect?

03:34.388 --> 03:35.998
- Peanut,
hell are you talking about--

03:36.041 --> 03:37.739
- I know you did your time
in Stateville,

03:37.782 --> 03:39.697
but maybe they
let you out early.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.525
Maybe you told them you had
a friend named Peanut.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.744
- You done lost your damn mind,
man.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.312
- Peanut pulled a gun.
- Hold it, hold on.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.227
Let it play out.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.100
- Peanut, I understand
that you wanna show out

03:51.143 --> 03:52.275
in front of your boy,

03:52.319 --> 03:53.711
but if you're gonna pull
that thing out,

03:53.755 --> 03:57.324
you're gonna have to stop
talking and start shooting.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.370
- Don't push it, bro.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.404
You're gonna follow me, bro?

04:34.448 --> 04:36.101
- You damn right I am.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.760
- You did good, boy.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.894
- Bro, I ain't had no choice.
Andre wasn't playing around.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.939
He don't trust your ass.
- It's all good, bro.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.463
We breaking them down.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.334
- Happy to help as long as you
don't write no paper on me.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.727
- What did I tell you
when I arrested you?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.772
You do me right,
I'll do you better.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.948
- Right on, bro.
- I'll holler at you.

04:56.992 --> 05:00.256
- Hey, yo, next time,
just grab the gun.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.084
There no need for you
to hit me, bro.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.304
- I hear you, dawg.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.788
- Talked to Homicide about
the Smokey thing.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.573
Turns out he's
a high ranking guy

05:12.616 --> 05:14.792
in Darius Walker's
organization.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.404
- Any suspects?
- Nothing real yet.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.406
All we know is two male Latinos
were spotted near

05:19.449 --> 05:21.321
the crime scene a few minutes
after it happened.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.452
- Smokey had 20 grand on him,

05:22.496 --> 05:23.758
which means he knew
the sellers.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.325
He probably did business
with them before.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.414
Otherwise he wouldn't have
had that much money on him.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.807
- So it's an inside job.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.983
Seller steals the cash,
keeps the product.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.942
Wouldn't be the first time
we've seen that happen.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.552
- No, but it's the first time
it's happened

05:35.596 --> 05:37.162
to somebody working
for Darius Walker.

05:37.206 --> 05:40.557
- Well, the good news is it
does open up an angle for us.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.472
Look, if we know the
Latin Players were behind this,

05:42.516 --> 05:44.822
you can be damn sure
Darius Walker knows too.

05:44.866 --> 05:48.173
That means he's going to be
looking for a new supplier.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.525
Jay, I want you to go under
as that supplier.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.787
- Sounds good.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.876
Hey, Sarge?
- Hmm?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.924
- So all that stuff last week?
We're good?

05:59.968 --> 06:03.363
- We are where we are.
Let's move on.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.936
- Man, this place is slammed.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.590
I should've been selling
baked goods.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.896
-  Right?

06:14.939 --> 06:16.680
And it's less risky 'cause
I don't know a brother

06:16.724 --> 06:18.203
who ever got popped
for moving scones.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.424
- Yeah, this place does
$800,000 a year in revenue.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.078
The one on Ashland does 1.2.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.428
- Damn, we are
in the wrong business.

06:27.474 --> 06:30.390
- Oh, the big boss.
What's he doing in here?

06:30.433 --> 06:31.565
He got a sweet tooth?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.089
- Yeah, for money.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.482
He owns the joint.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.222
He owns the whole damn chain.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.270
- He gave two smart,
young brothers

06:41.313 --> 06:43.490
300 grand to start
this whole place up.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.882
All legit.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.754
- It's a good way
to clean your cash too.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.712
- Nah, it's more than that.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.453
See, Darius wants
to change things.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.586
Educate young black folks
to think and act

06:52.629 --> 06:55.632
like those dudes up
in Silicon Valley.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.068
- Well,
I'm all about business too.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.984
I sell premium product
at a fair price.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.464
- Where does your product
come from?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.988
- Juarez.
I got a cousin down there.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.295
- Cousin?

07:06.338 --> 07:10.168
Bro, your cousins are
from Cape Cod or Lake Forest,

07:10.212 --> 07:11.605
not no Juarez.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.823
- I was born and raised
in Pilsen,

07:12.867 --> 07:14.259
but, uh, been in the game
for a long time,

07:14.303 --> 07:16.174
and I got a lot
of connections in Juarez.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.961
- Okay, well, I'm gonna have
to run this up the chain.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.484
- Naturally.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.400
- I appreciate the opportunity,
Andre.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.836
- All right.
- See you later?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.926
- Yeah, man.
Later.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.408
Darius is giving
these donuts away

07:32.452 --> 07:33.583
to clean off
his dirty-ass drug money.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.846
That's it, that's all.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
- What, you don't buy
the Robin Hood rap?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.459
- Not so much sold
on this selfless,

07:39.502 --> 07:41.635
black empowerment thing.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.419
It's hypocrites like that
that are the reason why

07:43.463 --> 07:47.162
I can't wake up with my brother
and sister every morning.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.956
- What can I do for you,
Detective?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.350
- Just wanted to follow up
on a few things

08:01.393 --> 08:04.832
regarding the Adam Ruzek case.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.487
- Well, I'm not talking without
my FOP lawyer present.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.792
- It's not a big deal.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.012
I just need to clarify
a few statements.

08:17.148 --> 08:20.064
- Okay, I'll schedule a meeting
with your FOP lawyer

08:20.108 --> 08:21.588
if that's what you want.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.154
- I'll tell you what I want.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.594
I want this case to go away.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.073
- Excuse me?

08:29.117 --> 08:30.771
- And you and I both know
the only reason

08:30.814 --> 08:32.468
you opened this case

08:32.512 --> 08:33.991
is 'cause Kelton squeezed you.

08:34.035 --> 08:38.213
He wanted me, so he told you
to go after Ruzek and Antonio.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.259
Yeah.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.566
I mean, Kelton's dead.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.786
Why are we wasting
our time on this?

08:45.829 --> 08:48.832
You wanna know the truth?

08:48.876 --> 08:53.707
I don't care about this case,
but the ship has sailed, Hank.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.404
It's with the state's
attorney's office now.

08:55.447 --> 08:58.799
- All right, you know the ASA?
- Yes, of course.

08:58.842 --> 09:02.324
- Maybe you take
his temperature.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.283
Why don't you see
how invested he really is

09:05.327 --> 09:06.937
in prosecuting a good cop

09:06.981 --> 09:10.419
over the accidental death
of a rapist/kidnapper?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.728
- I could do that.

09:14.771 --> 09:19.210
- Even if Adam did do
what you say he did,

09:19.254 --> 09:21.125
you know the only thing
he's guilty of

09:21.169 --> 09:24.564
is being a good partner
and a loyal friend.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.395
- I'll see what I can do.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.359
- Andre tells me
you've got a friend

09:37.402 --> 09:39.448
who's got a cousin in Juarez.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.754
- Yeah, my homie Jay.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.625
We used to hoop together
in high school.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.322
- Well, what's your take?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.020
- 10% the first time.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.067
- Outside of introducing people

09:50.111 --> 09:53.244
to your friend who's
got a cousin in Juarez,

09:53.288 --> 09:56.770
what are your
professional aspirations?

09:56.813 --> 09:58.467
- At the moment,
I'm just waiting for the state

09:58.510 --> 09:59.729
to give me my license back

09:59.773 --> 10:02.297
so I can start
a construction job.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.126
- Okay.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.392
How do you and Peanut
know each other?

10:10.435 --> 10:12.568
- We grew up on the same block.
Mom's were real tight.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.917
- What block?

10:13.961 --> 10:15.702
- 47th and Calumet
in Bronzeville.

10:15.745 --> 10:16.964
- Hey now, that's a real

10:17.007 --> 10:19.053
African American neighborhood
right there.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.750
Louis Armstrong grew up there.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.230
- Yeah, I know.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.102
Now there's a Starbucks
on every block.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.626
- You think that's a bad thing?

10:29.063 --> 10:30.064
Come in.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.329
- What's up?
You wanted to see me?

10:35.896 --> 10:38.289
- I hear you're moving product
near a grade school.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.464
Is that true?

10:39.508 --> 10:40.988
- Man, who said that?

10:54.001 --> 10:56.960
- I'm giving you
an opportunity

10:57.004 --> 10:59.180
to be accountable here, Bryce.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.838
Did you sell dope in front
of Clara Barton?

11:08.276 --> 11:11.322
- Yeah, I did.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.462
- You know that's against
the rules, right?

11:20.505 --> 11:21.898
- I know.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.857
I...

11:23.900 --> 11:25.728
I'm sorry, Darius.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.687
I just...

11:27.730 --> 11:29.645
I...

11:31.995 --> 11:34.476
- School needs
a baseball coach.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.912
Be there tomorrow at 4:00.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.396
You're done selling dope.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.444
Get out.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.726
- Your goldfish die
or something?

12:08.989 --> 12:11.165
- Nah, I'm just deep
in thought.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.821
- About what?

12:14.864 --> 12:16.997
- Business.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.216
- What kind of business?

12:19.260 --> 12:22.393
Wait, don't tell me.
I don't even want to know.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.526
Buy you a drink?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.530
- No, I got to go.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.879
Rain check?

12:31.228 --> 12:32.882
- I don't do rain checks,
sweetie,

12:32.926 --> 12:34.971
especially on a sunny day.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.234
- But you know how
that Chicago weather is.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.069
Just talked to Andre.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.636
Walker's not doing
the deal with you.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.420
- I'm offended.
- Well, he wasn't feeling it.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.944
- Does he have
another dealer lined up

12:50.987 --> 12:52.946
or is he still doing business
with the Latin Players?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.599
- I don't know.
Walker doesn't talk about it.

12:54.643 --> 12:57.298
- Units in the 7th District
and units on the citywide,

12:57.341 --> 12:59.256
we're getting multiple calls
of shots fired

12:59.300 --> 13:00.954
at 1221 South 58th Street.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.346
- That's like
three blocks away.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.000
- Let's roll.
- All right, stay here.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.742
Don't blow your cover.
- All right.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.410
- To your right.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.676
- Bodies.
- Go, I got you.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.417
- Two of them.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.334
Looks like they're both gone.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.957
- Don't come any closer!
- Police! Put it down!

13:48.001 --> 13:49.176
- We're the police!
- How do I know?

13:49.219 --> 13:50.786
- You see this?
This says we're the police.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.918
Put your gun down!

13:51.961 --> 13:53.354
- How do I know
you won't kill me?

13:53.397 --> 13:55.747
- Because if we wanted you
dead, you'd already be dead.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.966
You need to put
your gun down now.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.490
We will shoot.
You're not giving us a choice.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.535
Put your gun down now!

14:00.578 --> 14:02.450
- Oh, God!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

14:02.493 --> 14:04.887
I'm sorry, I thought
you were trying to kill me.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.847
I'm sorry.
- Safety was on.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.378
- Our two vics are Luis Tores
and Benji Rodriguez.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.946
Our girl is Gloria Romero,
she's Benji's girlfriend.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.251
Took some persuading,

14:21.295 --> 14:23.079
but she's confirmed that
they're Latin Players.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.559
- She see anything?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.430
- No, she said she was hanging
out with her friends.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.171
She went on a cigarette run,
she came back,

14:28.215 --> 14:30.608
she heard the shots,
so she ran and hid.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.262
She said she heard
a male voice say,

14:32.306 --> 14:33.785
"This is for Smokey."

14:33.829 --> 14:36.005
- All right, so Darius is
looking at revenge for Smokey.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.094
Is that what we're thinking?
- Makes sense.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.792
You kill one of mine,
I kill two of yours.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.925
- All right, well,
somebody had to see something.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.448
The shooter didn't
just fall from the sky.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.928
Let's dig in.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.713
Find witnesses,
surveillance cameras.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.455
- Sergeant?
- Sir?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.588
- Is it true
their throats were slit?

14:53.631 --> 14:55.329
Darius Walker's crew?

14:55.372 --> 14:57.070
- Yeah, it sure seems that way.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.941
- You know, a gang war
is not exactly an ideal way

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
to kick off one's tenure
as Interim Superintendent.

15:01.988 --> 15:05.208
- Especially if you want that
interim tag removed one day.

15:05.252 --> 15:08.168
- I just want to do what's best
for the people of this city.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.474
- Enough said.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.433
- Keep me posted, Sergeant.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.010
- I was just trying to help.
- I know.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.489
- He's out here selling product

15:25.533 --> 15:27.404
in front of children
and parents.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.580
You know?

15:29.624 --> 15:31.843
It's why I restrained him,
I called patrol.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.584
- You punched him in the face
and threw him on the ground.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.108
- Hold on,
he swung at me first.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.805
- You're off the job, Adam.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.328
You don't have the authority.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.331
-  Sarge, I mean,
he's out here

15:41.375 --> 15:43.029
just slinging crack
in the broad daylight.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.247
- It doesn't matter.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.509
- What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

15:45.553 --> 15:46.902
Of course it matters.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.991
- You can't get involved
in things like this, Adam.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.732
Not anymore, not until
your stuff gets resolved.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.473
- I was just trying to help.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.170
I mean...

15:55.824 --> 15:58.435
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.962
I'm fine.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.312
- Okay.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.532
Come on.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.012
- How did it go out there?
- Pretty damn good.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.405
I found a witness
who lives nearby.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.797
She saw a young black male.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.799
Skinny, 5'10, running
from the back of the building,

16:14.843 --> 16:16.279
and she said she'll do an ID

16:16.323 --> 16:17.846
once we have
an offender in custody.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.195
- Okay, good.
What about you two?

16:19.239 --> 16:20.631
- Well, we got some video.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.372
Uh, this is from an
auto part shop down the street

16:22.416 --> 16:23.634
from the abandoned building.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.854
We got a blue Ford Taurus,
pulls up.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.421
It's got a--a dent
in the side panel.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.249
Now it idles in front
of the building,

16:29.292 --> 16:30.685
and then the shots go
off at 3:29.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.947
It just takes off.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.383
- All right,
did you run that plate?

16:33.427 --> 16:34.906
- Yeah, it's a dummy.
It came back empty.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.865
- So if the car was idling
when the shots were fired...

16:36.908 --> 16:38.345
- It means the driver's
not the shooter.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.781
- Could be the getaway driver.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.696
- All right, so let's find
that blue Taurus, fast.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.524
Talk to Kevin.
Get him up to speed.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.742
- Hank?
- Yeah.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.006
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, what's up?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.664
- I just talked to Adam,
and I'm worried.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.365
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.890
As tough as he is,

17:01.933 --> 17:04.588
he is not gonna last a month
on the inside.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.859
- Listen, if you're telling me
there's nothing

17:14.903 --> 17:16.948
you need me to do,
I'll leave it alone.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.515
But dawg, if there's something
I can do

17:18.559 --> 17:19.647
to keep this deal
back on track--

17:19.690 --> 17:22.258
- Bro, it's dead.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.781
Just leave it alone.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.306
- Okay, I'm just making sure.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.091
Who's the kid?

17:29.135 --> 17:32.442
- Name's Jerald.
Darius helps him out.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.140
- Okay.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.185
Pretty sure Jerald
helps out Darius too.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.622
Ain't nothing for free.
- That don't concern you, bro.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.059
- What you mean it don't?

17:40.102 --> 17:42.104
Come on, man, I'm trying
to do business with y'all.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.280
Obviously, he prefers working
with fifth graders.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.548
- Yeah, he just left the bar.
We'll track him.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.558
- So how long we got
to do this, man?

18:01.602 --> 18:03.821
- Until I say stop.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.215
- No, no, this ain't right,
and you ain't my boss.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.695
- Not here, man.
What are you--

18:07.738 --> 18:09.218
- I'm sick of all
this damn lying.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.133
- You're gonna be sick of being
dead if you don't shut up.

18:11.177 --> 18:15.268
You're doing this
until the job is done, Peanut.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.313
Okay?
- All right, yeah, it's my bad.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.316
- Is it mine?

18:48.301 --> 18:50.172
- The more we dig into
our bartender, Nina Rodriguez,

18:50.216 --> 18:51.521
the less we know.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.045
Plates are fictitious, no DL,
no criminal info.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.569
- We know she rented
a studio apartment

18:55.612 --> 18:57.179
three months ago,
and is paying cash for it.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.094
- So it could be tips.
It could also be drug money.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.182
- Well, what do you think, Kev?

19:00.226 --> 19:02.402
Is she part of Walker's
drug crew?

19:02.445 --> 19:04.186
- I'm not sure,
but it's possible.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.622
- The real question is,
is she the shooter,

19:05.666 --> 19:09.104
the getaway driver, or is
someone just using her car?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.845
- Hey.
Let's find out.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.107
Put some pressure on her.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.327
See if you can catch
her dirty in a drug deal,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.198
Get her to flip on Walker.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.722
You talked to the ASA?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.637
- Yeah.
Got a second?

19:20.681 --> 19:21.682
- Come on.

19:24.598 --> 19:28.341
All right, I talked to Heller.
He worked a little magic.

19:28.384 --> 19:31.170
Prosecutor is willing
to cut you a deal.

19:31.866 --> 19:35.348
12 months, you do six.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.567
- If I roll the dice at trial?

19:38.351 --> 19:40.179
- You lose, you're looking at
three to five.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.661
- Well, maybe I'll win?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.315
Lawyer says it's 50-50.

19:46.359 --> 19:50.058
- Yeah, well, your lawyer
doesn't have to do the time

19:50.101 --> 19:51.494
if he's wrong.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.931
- Yeah, but...

19:53.975 --> 19:55.237
what happens when I'm out?

19:58.675 --> 20:01.635
My career's over,
I've got to find a new job?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.506
All I know is being
in the police, Sarge.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.682
It's who I am.
It's, like, all I got.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.255
- Then we fight it.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.961
- Look at you.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.702
Just the person
I wanted to see.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.922
I've got a little
opportunity for you.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.184
- Yeah, what kind
of an opportunity?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.359
- The kind that gets you more

20:30.403 --> 20:33.362
of those gold necklaces
you like.

20:33.406 --> 20:36.017
One of my guys sells premium H,

20:36.060 --> 20:39.325
and he's gonna give me 10%
of everything I bring in.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.849
I figure with your line of work
and place of business,

20:41.892 --> 20:44.547
you might know some people
other than Darius.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.332
I took a run at him.
He ain't going.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.424
- What's my end?

20:51.467 --> 20:53.252
- 5%.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.905
- And what kind of weight
are we talking about?

20:54.949 --> 20:57.256
- I'm talking about four bricks
at a time at 50 a pop.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.605
You smack them with
a five-stack tax

20:58.648 --> 21:00.955
on your back end
that's 20 grand total.

21:00.998 --> 21:04.045
10,000 apiece,
me and you.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.394
- Man, you sure
know your stuff.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.831
- Well, I'm trying
to make this money, Nina.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.399
You down or not?

21:10.443 --> 21:12.923
- I'll make some calls.
Mm-hmm?

21:12.967 --> 21:15.752
- Let me holla at you.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.457
- What up, what up?
- Sup?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.589
This is my boy, Trey.
- What's up, Trey?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.243
- Nothing much.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.376
I understand y'all got
some candy you want to shift.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.594
- How much can you handle?

21:31.638 --> 21:33.901
- Two pieces of taffy.
Maybe three.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.555
Nina say you got
some pure stuff.

21:35.598 --> 21:36.599
- Mm-hmm.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.079
- You tight south
of the border?

21:38.122 --> 21:40.168
- Juarez.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.475
- How about 100 for three?

21:42.518 --> 21:44.041
- I thought you said
this guy was serious.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.347
- And I thought
I said 50 a pop.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.044
- All right, how about this?

21:47.088 --> 21:48.829
My boy gives you
100 grand right now.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.352
Okay, that's for two.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.181
You front him the other brick,
for trust and all.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.357
If the product's as good
as you say it is,

21:55.401 --> 21:57.272
I mean, we're in business
for a long time.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.668
- Makes sense.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.671
- All right.
Where and when?

22:11.155 --> 22:13.114
We're on the move
for the dope.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.333
- Copy that.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.945
You're covered in back.
Hailey, you set?

22:17.988 --> 22:20.164
- Yup, set.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.739
- You wanna test it?
- Nah.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.829
You say it's pure.
It's pure.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.701
It's about trust, right?

22:42.491 --> 22:45.276
- Oh, they're coming.
Kim.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.770
Oh, these two don't
look like altar boys.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.512
Jay, we got two bogeys
maybe coming your way.

23:03.556 --> 23:07.386
Sarge, you get that?
- Yeah, keep an eye.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.650
Jay, stay focused.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.957
- What's wrong?

23:14.001 --> 23:16.046
What's wrong is
I don't see any money.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.093
- Calm down, bro.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.442
I've got it right here.

23:22.749 --> 23:23.924
- Gun!

23:23.967 --> 23:26.535
- Jay, two armed offenders
coming your way!

23:26.579 --> 23:28.755
- Hands up! Chicago PD!
Put your guns down!

23:28.798 --> 23:29.669
- Police!

23:29.712 --> 23:31.584
- Put your hands down!
Hey!

23:31.627 --> 23:34.195
- Get down!
- Get down!

23:34.238 --> 23:35.501
- Put it down!
- Put your hands up!

23:35.544 --> 23:37.154
- Hands up now!
- I'm a cop!

23:37.198 --> 23:38.591
- We're cops, not--

23:38.634 --> 23:41.420
- Drop your weapon!
- We're police!

23:41.463 --> 23:42.595
- Hey, everybody shut up!
Shut up!

23:42.638 --> 23:44.161
- Chill!
Just chill!

23:44.205 --> 23:45.641
I'm a cop!

23:45.685 --> 23:47.556
- Let me see some ID
and badges.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.862
My button's in my pocket.

23:48.905 --> 23:51.168
I'm Raul Acosta,
assigned to Squad E66,

23:51.212 --> 23:53.040
long-term investigations.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.911
My Commander is Marty Belmont.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.217
- It's legit.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.481
- Lower your weapon.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.105
- Thank God it's not like
the old days.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.193
Shoot first, ask later.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.673
- How long you've been working
these guys?

24:17.717 --> 24:19.980
- We've been up on Walker
for about three months now.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.372
- You have anymore
undercovers working?

24:21.416 --> 24:22.896
- Just our rookie.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.463
- They plucked me straight out
of the Academy.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.944
- Who's they?
- OCD Deputy Chief Morales.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.990
Didn't think he knew I existed.
- Wait, hold up.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.818
So the blue dented Taurus
outside the murder scene,

24:31.861 --> 24:33.210
what were you doing?

24:33.254 --> 24:34.777
- Walker mentioned the address.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.214
I was checking it out, trying
to take down some plates.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.781
Next thing you know,
I hear gunshots.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.696
- So you take off
not to blow your cover.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.698
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

24:42.742 --> 24:45.658
- What's your real name?
- Vanessa.

24:45.701 --> 24:48.312
Vanessa Rojas.
You?

24:48.356 --> 24:52.447
- Kevin Atwater.
Nice to meet you.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.623
- You too.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.756
So now what?

24:56.799 --> 24:59.759
- All right, I just brought
the deputy chief up to speed.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.718
Per his orders,
we are joining forces.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.894
Walker remains
the priority target.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.287
All right, Vanessa,

25:06.330 --> 25:08.158
you've got the best
relationship with this guy.

25:08.202 --> 25:11.161
Anything you can tell us about
this recent double homicide?

25:11.205 --> 25:13.250
- No, all I heard was him
mention the address.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.556
That's it.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.166
- What about where he does
most of his business?

25:16.210 --> 25:17.690
Can you plant a wire
in that back office?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.909
- Too dangerous.
- I can do it.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.129
- Remember what I told you.
- I know.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.871
Being a hero will get
you fired or get you dead.

25:24.914 --> 25:27.482
But this is easy,
I promise.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.483
- All right.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.708
- Nina, I'm running late.
You got this?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.361
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

25:37.405 --> 25:38.493
- Where you going?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.277
- House warming party
for my cousin.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.584
I just helped him buy
his first house,

25:42.628 --> 25:45.544
and the man is so happy,
he won't stop crying.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.505
- Scotty, I'm gonna go grab
some stuff in the back.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.779
All right, I'm in.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.042
- Copy that.
All clear.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.489
- Rojas, get out of there.
Walker's coming back.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.802
- Hey.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.504
- What the hell
are you doing in here?

26:33.548 --> 26:35.681
- We ran out of cognac.
Well, the good stuff, actually.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.378
Had to raid your private stash.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.949
You can check the bar
if you don't believe me.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.994
- I'll do that.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.388
How'd you get in?
- Your spare key.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.390
You told me about it, remember?

26:51.697 --> 26:53.742
Yo, I was just trying to help,

26:53.786 --> 26:56.527
but if you don't want me
in here, that's fine by me.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.268
- I don't.

27:00.575 --> 27:04.840
- I won't come in here,
whether or not you invite me.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.407
Want me to leave the cognac?

27:08.061 --> 27:10.672
- Take the cognac.
Leave the key.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.595
- Rojas did a nice job.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.162
- Yeah, she's quick on
her feet and--

27:22.205 --> 27:25.034
- Boss, we intercepted a lot
of chatter on Walker's wire.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.383
We're going through it all now.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.037
Good news,
we found his heroin supplier,

27:28.081 --> 27:29.865
a guy named Mateo Garcia.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.606
- Garcia from
the Latin Players?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.216
Walker's supposed to be
at war with them.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.305
- Sounds like they made peace.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.481
- Well, Garcia's insisting
on meeting Walker in person

27:37.525 --> 27:38.526
as a sign of good faith.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.223
- Okay, we got
a time and place?

27:40.267 --> 27:42.095
- Yeah, today at 5:00.
I'm not sure where yet.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.923
There's a lot of code
and a lot of addresses.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.576
They mentioned Ashburn,
but more recently,

27:45.620 --> 27:47.927
he's been talking about
his bakery on 21st street.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.537
- All right,
let's sit on the bakery.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.408
- Okay.
- We wait for Garcia to arrive,

27:51.452 --> 27:55.195
observe the exchange,
and arrest everyone in sight.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.026
- All quiet.

28:00.069 --> 28:03.290
- All clear in the back alley.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.510
- Sarge, maybe they're doing
the meet in Ashburn.

28:06.554 --> 28:10.079
- Standby.
Let's wait it out.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.390
- The hell?
- It's Jerald.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.131
The kid Walker's
doing business with.

28:18.174 --> 28:21.525
- Yeah.
I've seen him around.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.578
- Sarge, we've got an employee

28:30.621 --> 28:32.014
that just walked out
of the bakery.

28:32.058 --> 28:35.148
He gave Jerald a bag.
Could be the place.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.107
- He's getting on his bike.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.413
- All right, stay with him.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.502
See if he rolls
towards Ashburn.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.729
- All right,
pull up right here.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.081
He just went down Clarke.
I've got to get him on foot.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.229
Chicago PD!

29:13.273 --> 29:16.015
- Please don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.669
Sir, I--I was
just bringing some muffins

29:18.713 --> 29:19.801
to Mr. Marley here.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.498
He's a part of the program.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.499
- Program?

29:22.543 --> 29:23.849
What program
are you talking about?

29:23.892 --> 29:25.415
- Mr. Walker's food bank.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.983
They give all the food that
they don't use to the poor.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.986
- Stand down.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.727
Throw me your wallet.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.561
University of Chicago.

29:40.604 --> 29:41.954
- Yeah.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.651
I just started school
last month.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.133
- What the hell are you doing
with Darius Walker?

29:47.176 --> 29:49.091
- He--he helps me out.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.964
He pays my tuition.
Bought my books too.

29:57.186 --> 30:00.363
- Hands down.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.713
I'm sorry.
Misunderstanding.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.374
Sarge, we followed the kid.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.159
He did not have drugs
or cash on him.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.639
We've got to go
to the Ashburn location.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.032
- Are you sure?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.425
- Yeah.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.992
- Okay, head over there now.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.300
- Deal's going down on Ashburn.
Let's move.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.958
- All right, Jay, we're
pulling up on 19th street.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.612
Looks quiet around here.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.703
- Copy that.
Nothing yet.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.620
- Over there in the alley.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.796
- Hmm?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.276
Yeah, we got eyes.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.409
- Well, what do you see?

30:46.453 --> 30:48.803
- We see Mateo Garcia
and Darius Walker.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.589
- This looks like
they're negotiating right now.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.635
I don't see
any product or cash.

30:54.678 --> 30:57.638
- Just wait for the exchange.
- Copy that, Sarge.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.470
Okay, Garcia just pulled out
a bag.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.254
- That looks good.
I see product.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.300
- Mm-hmm.
Come on, Darius.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.867
That's quality stuff
right there.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.303
Show him the money, huh?

31:13.828 --> 31:15.047
- Bingo.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.439
We've got a positive.
- Copy.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.267
Jay, you guys take the lead.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.921
Kevin, Vanessa,
cover the perimeter.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.227
Let's go.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.367
All right, let's get
these people out of here.

31:31.411 --> 31:32.978
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.109
- Kids, hey.
Move.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.458
- Can you guys move back
the other way?

31:35.502 --> 31:37.460
Just go to the other side.
It's okay.

31:37.504 --> 31:38.940
- You two, leave the park.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.202
Get out.
Go!

31:42.378 --> 31:44.250
- Gun!
Gun!

31:44.293 --> 31:45.468
- Down!
Get down!

31:45.512 --> 31:46.643
Everybody down!
- Get down!

31:46.687 --> 31:48.863
- Run!
We've got a runner!

31:48.907 --> 31:50.212
Get your hands up!
- All hands up!

31:50.256 --> 31:52.693
- Get on the car!
On the car!

31:52.736 --> 31:54.738
- Don't move!
Drop your weapon right now!

31:54.782 --> 31:56.523
- On the car!
I've got Walker.

31:56.566 --> 31:57.828
- Get against the wall!

31:57.872 --> 31:59.961
- Do it!

32:00.005 --> 32:01.223
- No!

32:05.532 --> 32:07.490
You okay?
- Yeah.

32:07.534 --> 32:09.666
- Vincent-21-Davis,
shots fired at the police.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.886
- Copy that...
- Let's go.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.326
- Stop the car!
Stop the car!

32:17.370 --> 32:18.632
- Go, go!
- Hey!

32:18.675 --> 32:20.199
- Get out of the car!
- Hey!

32:20.242 --> 32:23.332
Hey, run! Run!
- Get out!

32:30.513 --> 32:33.125
- Police!
Hey, police!

32:33.168 --> 32:34.953
Stop the vehicle!

32:39.044 --> 32:40.871
- Vanessa!

33:02.067 --> 33:07.681
- Yeah, Darius Walker,
I'm the police.

33:10.075 --> 33:13.817
You're staring down
pretty serious charges too.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.384
- I've got some
really good lawyers.

33:15.428 --> 33:18.170
- It doesn't really matter
how good your lawyers are.

33:18.213 --> 33:21.782
We've got you dead to rights.
I think you know that.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.436
Those murders,
that's a different story.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.611
We're still investigating
those,

33:24.654 --> 33:27.657
so you've got
a little leverage.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.703
Tell me how those
two Latino kids died,

33:29.746 --> 33:31.313
and I can break you off
with a better deal.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.054
- I've got nothing to do
with those murders.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.925
- Come on, brother, do you
expect for me to believe--

33:34.969 --> 33:37.319
- Don't call me brother.

33:37.363 --> 33:41.889
And no I don't expect you
to believe a damn thing I say,

33:41.932 --> 33:44.848
but I did not kill
those two boys.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.807
- Tell me who did.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.074
Garcia.

33:53.118 --> 33:57.383
- Garcia took out
his own people?

33:57.426 --> 33:59.863
- Damn right he did.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.736
He wanted to make amends,

34:02.779 --> 34:04.912
get back in business with me.

34:07.219 --> 34:10.657
So that means the only thing
that you and I have to discuss

34:10.700 --> 34:13.268
is this drug case.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.922
- Mm-hmm.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.882
Which is not murder.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.276
But that's a serious case.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.235
We're talking about
a lot of weight,

34:23.278 --> 34:24.671
a lot of dollars,

34:24.714 --> 34:27.152
enough to put a low life
like you away for a long time.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.459
- You just don't get it,
do you?

34:31.895 --> 34:34.202
- What don't I get?

34:34.246 --> 34:35.682
Hmm?

34:35.725 --> 34:41.818
- Whether I'm here or not,
users are still gonna use.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.256
The only difference is they're
gonna be buying the product

34:44.299 --> 34:48.173
from some 19-year-old punk
with too much to prove.

34:48.216 --> 34:50.218
Some badass half a gangbanger

34:50.262 --> 34:51.915
willing to shoot up
a city block

34:51.959 --> 34:53.395
over a Twitter dispute

34:53.439 --> 34:56.442
or a spat with some fatass girl
in tight jeans.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.489
But the biggest difference
between me

35:00.533 --> 35:03.579
and the person
who is about to replace me

35:03.623 --> 35:07.148
is that I reinvest my profits

35:07.192 --> 35:10.412
in the community
and the people.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.765
- So you're the Robin Hood
for black folk, huh?

35:15.809 --> 35:17.637
- No.

35:17.680 --> 35:22.424
No, Robin Hood
stole from the rich,

35:22.468 --> 35:25.949
gave to the poor.

35:25.993 --> 35:31.390
Hypothetically speaking,
I take from the weak

35:31.433 --> 35:36.003
and give to the strong
so they can get even stronger.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.969
Let's be honest, brother.

35:50.235 --> 35:55.109
Some folks out there
ain't got no chance.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.373
They're weak, uninspired.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.593
All they think about
is getting high.

36:00.636 --> 36:04.684
So I sell them
what they want, heroin.

36:04.727 --> 36:08.427
With that money, I invest
in brothers and sisters

36:08.470 --> 36:11.386
who got game,
who got smarts,

36:11.430 --> 36:14.259
who are willing to put
in the time

36:14.302 --> 36:17.740
and the effort to make
something of themselves.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.439
Legally.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.223
Like it or not,

36:22.267 --> 36:25.487
that's the only way black folks

36:25.531 --> 36:28.925
are gonna get
out of these streets.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.797
It ain't pretty,

36:30.840 --> 36:34.801
it ain't fashionable
to say out loud,

36:34.844 --> 36:36.106
but it's the truth.

36:43.723 --> 36:48.336
And I know none of y'all
in blue want to believe this...

36:50.208 --> 36:55.517
But Darius Walker
is good for Chicago.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.138
Ballistics came back
on the gun

37:08.182 --> 37:10.880
found in Garcia's car.

37:10.924 --> 37:13.143
Striations match the bullets

37:13.187 --> 37:14.971
that killed
the two Latin Players.

37:18.236 --> 37:22.327
Okay, so Darius
was telling the truth.

37:22.370 --> 37:26.461
- Yeah, well, we still got
a solid drug trafficking case

37:26.505 --> 37:28.463
on this guy.

37:28.507 --> 37:32.206
- True, but Sarge
just think about it.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.860
I mean, we get rid
of Darius Walker.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.123
- Right.
- Whoever else takes his place

37:36.166 --> 37:37.733
isn't going to be
as disciplined,

37:37.777 --> 37:38.778
not as intelligent,

37:38.821 --> 37:40.170
sure as hell ain't gonna
give a damn

37:40.214 --> 37:42.738
about the black community
the way he does.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.958
- And here I thought
you didn't like this guy.

37:45.001 --> 37:48.309
- I can't stand his ass, but...

37:50.311 --> 37:53.445
As crazy as it sounds,
he does make the city safer.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.927
- Yeah,
maybe we are better off

37:57.971 --> 38:00.190
with this guy on the street.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.980
- That is a hell of
a proposition, Sergeant.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.853
You really think you can
persuade Darius Walker

38:10.897 --> 38:12.464
to play ball?

38:12.507 --> 38:14.204
- Well, he's a businessman.
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.248 --> 38:15.815
- I think he'll realize

38:15.858 --> 38:18.600
that helping the police
arrest his competitors

38:18.644 --> 38:21.734
is a hell of a lot better
than doing ten years in prison

38:21.777 --> 38:23.083
for drug trafficking.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.911
- Big risk cutting a deal
with somebody like that.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.608
If word gets out...
- It won't.

38:26.652 --> 38:29.829
Look, you want big results,
big arrests,

38:29.872 --> 38:31.309
you've got to take big swings.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.225
Now Walker will be logged in

38:35.269 --> 38:37.140
as a reliable
cooperating defendant.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.665
I'll be his personal handler.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.363
I mean, your only role here
is to ring the bell,

38:42.407 --> 38:44.452
and talk about all
the high profile arrests

38:44.496 --> 38:47.237
your new and improved
police department is making.

38:48.369 --> 38:51.677
I mean,
if things go as planned...

38:53.374 --> 38:56.508
That interim tag will
be removed before Halloween.

39:03.515 --> 39:04.690
- All right.

39:06.561 --> 39:09.869
I want plausible deniability
on this across the board, okay?

39:12.524 --> 39:15.527
- I do have a favor to ask.
Actually, it's...

39:17.224 --> 39:19.052
It's more like a condition.

39:20.401 --> 39:23.273
- When things are
too good to be true, huh?

39:23.317 --> 39:25.711
- Yeah, well,
it's a good rule of thumb

39:25.754 --> 39:28.627
in this town, anyway.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.847
- What is it?
What do you want?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.208
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.080
What's going on?
Is everything all right?

39:47.123 --> 39:49.299
- Yeah, we're good.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.129
Here you go.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.223
- I don't understand.
What's--what's going on?

40:00.267 --> 40:03.052
- ASA is dismissing
the charges.

40:03.096 --> 40:06.142
Insufficient evidence.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.057
You're good.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.154
What'd you do?

40:19.504 --> 40:22.768
- All that matters
is it's done.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.818
- Thank you, Sarge.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.212
- Yeah.
- I owe you.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.737
- Yeah.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.262
- I owe you everything.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.704
- All right.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.103
- I'll see you in the morning.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.931
- Yes, sir.
