01:02.604 --> 01:07.692
<i>Now listen, you spineless
and immoral bastards.</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:11.696
<i>There is a line between
good and evil in the world.</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:15.992
<i>And that line is me.</i>

01:18.954 --> 01:20.914
<i>I won't quit.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:22.707
<i>Or stop.</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:25.752
<i>BECBUSG I...</i>

01:25.961 --> 01:27.003
<i>I am...</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:06.626
And now, to the domestic news.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.212
<i>CEO of VALA Pekka Erola.</i>

02:09.462 --> 02:12.299
This is a great day for
the Finnish economy.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.845
When this law comes into force
Finnish economy will skyrocket.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.222
Unemployment keeps growing.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.618
The city of Mikkeli
doesn't lose faith!

02:40.243 --> 02:43.121
The EU commission has
granted a special license

02:43.371 --> 02:46.458
<i>for NH25 vaccine delivery
to developing countries.</i>

02:46.958 --> 02:48.335
Pekka Erola, what does
this mean

02:48.543 --> 02:49.836
to the VALA organization?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.797
Years of development
with universities

02:53.006 --> 02:56.926
<i>and our own research institutes
finally bear some fruit.</i>

02:57.344 --> 02:59.220
<i>But both, Mikkeli and
Varkaus haven 't supported</i>

02:59.429 --> 03:00.680
<i>the distribution of
the vaccine?</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:04.768
Why Mikkeli and Varkaus won't
agree to cooperate with VALA,

03:04.976 --> 03:06.728
is a complete mystery to me.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.814
Who's paying so that
pharmaceutical companies

03:10.023 --> 03:13.109
can legally test their products
on innocent children?

03:13.485 --> 03:17.238
Who says that? This will bring
export revenues to Finland

03:17.447 --> 03:18.823
for the next ten years.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.161
<i>There are no
reliable findings of the</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:26.039
<i>NH25 vaccine's
possible adverse effects.</i>

03:26.247 --> 03:28.208
<i>The European Union hasn't
granted trading license</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:29.959
<i>to the vaccine
in its member countries.</i>

03:30.460 --> 03:32.003
<i>Niina Heikkinen,
from Mikkeli.</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:35.757
This world would be
a better place,

03:35.965 --> 03:38.009
without investigative
journalists.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.428
That's the freedom
of speech, dad.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.472
No one has asked you anything!

03:42.889 --> 03:46.518
And when you're working for me,
I'm not your dad, I'm your boss!

03:47.686 --> 03:48.603
Roger that.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.482
Fucking gross!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.192
Use that.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.362
Were we that difficult as kids?

03:57.904 --> 04:01.491
Can't remember. But if we
were, they beat us up.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.159
And look how we turned out.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.452
This is a weird company

04:04.661 --> 04:06.371
for not listening to
its employees at all.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.831
Respect must be earned.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.959
And the sooner you learn it,

04:11.167 --> 04:13.712
the better the chances for
you to stay alive.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.424
Roger that.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.511
And return the cloth clean.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.415
Happy Father's Day!

04:52.208 --> 04:54.377
Here comes
your favorite breakfast.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.296
Thank you.

04:57.630 --> 05:02.093
Good morning. What have
I done to deserve this?

05:03.803 --> 05:06.055
Hey. And what have we here...

05:06.890 --> 05:08.057
This.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.560
A biker jacket.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.147
And, am I correct that, the
bike is waiting downstairs?

05:14.355 --> 05:17.692
- There won't be a bike.
- Well, of course not.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.821
So, Enni, does daddy look good
sitting in a bus with this?

05:21.988 --> 05:22.822
Real good.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.574
What does the hero
want to do today?

05:24.824 --> 05:25.867
Oh, I can choose, can I...?

05:26.075 --> 05:28.536
Yes, because you
always take care of us.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.913
Well, it is my job.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.833
You want to take the whole
family to the amusement park!

05:34.125 --> 05:35.877
- To Visulahti?
- Yeah.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.921
Alright! Then, we'll go.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.426
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.260
Yuck.

05:44.469 --> 05:48.306
Yuck to yourself.
So you're starting to...

05:48.807 --> 05:50.517
<i>Here comes the
tickling punishment...</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:32.892
Alright, Kurikka.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.978
Where is the money?

06:37.272 --> 06:38.481
I don't know.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.822
Where is the money?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.700
I really don't know.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.019
Kurikka, Kurikka.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.980
Now tell me, where is the money?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.901
You know me.
I wouldn't do such a thing.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.079
Please, please Lahtaaja no more.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.542
No more.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.295
Two million...

07:43.338 --> 07:44.422
changes...

07:45.298 --> 07:46.424
<i>man...</i>

07:46.883 --> 07:47.967
quite a...

07:49.344 --> 07:50.303
bit.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.981
Where is the money?!

08:10.073 --> 08:11.699
Let's go take care of the cargo.

08:17.747 --> 08:22.251
Come on, everyone is there.
Now smile.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.632
You two! Take care of Kurikka,
he's over there.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.593
You mean...
take care of Kurikka?

08:30.802 --> 08:32.303
Well didn't I just say so?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.805
Yeah yeah.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.832
For fuck's sake.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.834
She was just around the corner.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.002
<i>She heard something.</i>

09:05.795 --> 09:07.005
God dammit Kake.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.341
You were supposed
to bring some pizza, not pussy!

09:24.731 --> 09:25.982
Hey, let me 9°-

09:29.485 --> 09:33.197
Hey, think about it, you get
six for the price of one. Six.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.497
Damn, do I need to
warm you up a bit?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.879
<i>MAN:
Hello. Six of today's special.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:51.549
Yeah, blue cheese.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.886
Alright.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.267
Yeah?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.394
Is the cargo unloaded
and packed now?

10:04.228 --> 10:05.354
Yes...sort of.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.774
Sort of?! What is the problem?

10:14.739 --> 10:15.782
What is it now?

10:18.242 --> 10:19.410
Our lights turned off.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.539
Goddammit,
now it's going really weird.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.708
Now you'll give me
a clear answer.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.836
<i>What the hell is going on there
you fucking Muppet characters!</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:30.755
It's the goddamn fuse.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.757
Repel go fix it!

10:33.466 --> 10:36.427
<i>Goddamn guys, if you have
fucked something up there,</i>

10:36.636 --> 10:39.347
I'll rip your eyes out
from your ass, I promise!

11:08.584 --> 11:09.669
Well, what is it now?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.590
<i>Goddamn Muppets!</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:16.717
That goddamn moron.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.678
If only everything
would be okay.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.353
Repe?

11:28.938 --> 11:29.856
Repe?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.278
There is someone in here!

11:46.414 --> 11:47.498
Who's there?

11:49.458 --> 11:50.751
Who's there?!

11:55.715 --> 11:57.717
Where the hell are those guys?

13:02.198 --> 13:02.990
<i>Hey!</i>

13:03.324 --> 13:04.325
<i>Hey!</i>

13:24.804 --> 13:25.972
That is not enough.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.559
They need to be afraid of you.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.772
Are you going to help, or are
you just going to stare?

13:50.037 --> 13:51.580
What the fuck was that?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.082
Fucking whore!

14:20.609 --> 14:22.153
What the fuck?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.618
What the hell is Rendel?

14:31.245 --> 14:33.331
Maybe the letters
are in wrong order?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.125
<i>Six today's special and...</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:52.266
There's a small mess inside,
go clean it up.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.811
Is there more people to
take to the hospital?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.856
To the hospital?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.609
Yeah, to the same place
we took Kurikka.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.906
You goddamn apes.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.329
I told you to put Kurikka
six feet under!

15:13.704 --> 15:14.955
I told you so!

15:16.582 --> 15:20.127
But didn't you say,
"take care of him"?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.594
Well, are we going
to go get Kurikka

15:28.803 --> 15:30.054
out of the hospital, then?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.434
Get inside.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.821
First he gives crappy orders,
and then fucking acts like that.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.870
<i>Mr. Kurikka.</i>

15:58.374 --> 15:59.583
<i>Mr. Kurikka.</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:04.255
Open wide.

16:18.853 --> 16:19.979
<i>Mr. Kurikka.</i>

16:20.396 --> 16:24.567
Unfortunately, I have to give
you a no for an answer.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.403
We here in Trust Kapital

16:27.611 --> 16:30.739
have gone through
this proposition of yours.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.161
And we have come to the result,

16:37.079 --> 16:41.041
That your predictions are
simply too unrealistic.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.128
Unrealistic? I mean, what's
the problem here?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.590
The profit calculations
of the vaccine are good.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.341
Maybe even too good.

16:50.509 --> 16:55.347
Some could say,
they're overly optimistic.

16:56.891 --> 16:57.600
And besides,

16:57.808 --> 17:01.896
the questionable publicity of
the vaccine doesn't really help.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.064
Right.

17:05.274 --> 17:08.235
I guess I have to talk to
someone higher-up.

17:08.777 --> 17:09.945
YES.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.532
Of course,
as financial director,

17:15.159 --> 17:17.953
decisions of this scale
comes directly to me.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.084
You know it as well as I,
that's not how it works.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.586
Excuse me?

17:26.128 --> 17:30.674
Yes, there always is someone
higher-up. In every decision.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.551
Even in this.

17:34.303 --> 17:38.682
Anyway this opinion
is mine, and ours.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.851
Okay.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.102
Thank you.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.854
Thank you.

17:44.813 --> 17:45.898
Have a nice day.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.070
I understand.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.491
Oh, and this Réimii is
after all a financial director.

17:57.159 --> 18:01.330
Okay. Well I do know what
to do to such directors.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.375
I thought as much. Yes.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.464
LaPPL

18:18.931 --> 18:20.975
But, I haven't done
anything wrong.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.937
How will I support my family?

18:26.313 --> 18:27.648
You're a competent guy.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.277
You'll find something.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.552
- Did you ask from the harbor?
- Yes.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.804
They weren't interested.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.601
And there really isn't any
other job at the Trust?

19:03.809 --> 19:04.602
<i>No.</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:06.937
<i>Did you
talk to that Timo?</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:08.230
No I didn't, and I won't.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.026
How about the loan?

19:13.235 --> 19:17.156
They didn't grant it.
I wouldn't either.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.786
Well, hi.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.997
Horsey broke.

19:25.581 --> 19:30.544
No way. Come here,
and let's take a look.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.338
Oh dear...

19:34.089 --> 19:37.384
Listen. It looks like
this is something

19:37.593 --> 19:40.804
that daddy might just
be able to fix.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.808
If mommy could read a
bedtime story for you.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.646
Well? Could you?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.857
What if daddy would read
the bedtime stories,

19:52.066 --> 19:53.651
<i>since he hasn't
anything else to do?</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:55.903
Well, he has to fix
that horsey now.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.280
How 'bout we do this,

19:58.489 --> 20:01.700
daddy reads the bedtime story
and then daddy fixes the horsey?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.453
- Okay.
- Let's go.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.008
She was shrouded in the night,
moved like shadow...

20:18.342 --> 20:19.968
and like a silent wind,

20:20.177 --> 20:22.846
she brought a spark
of hope with her.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.390
Daddy?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.976
Does the bad people
really exist?

20:30.813 --> 20:31.939
No.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.108
This is just a fairy tale.

20:35.651 --> 20:41.073
There happens to be some bad
stuff in the world time to time.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.077
But still, bad people
don't really exist there.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.176
Ku rikka?

21:03.387 --> 21:04.596
Ku rikka?

21:07.850 --> 21:08.851
What?

21:15.607 --> 21:18.444
And where might the
patient from this room be?

21:18.652 --> 21:20.988
Mr. Kurikka left the hospital
just a moment ago.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.823
Without legs?

21:25.325 --> 21:26.702
Shut up.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.361
Was there vaccine
from VALA in those boxes?

22:01.570 --> 22:02.821
How should I know?

22:03.238 --> 22:04.281
But let me tell you,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.617
that I worked
worth much more than 200.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.994
I was almost
gang raped and killed.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.246
How much?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.248
700.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.002
I'll give you five hundred.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.924
- Plus the 200?
- Yes.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.845
Yeah, since I'd be dead too, if
that one guy hadn't showed up.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.680
What guy?

22:29.139 --> 22:32.100
A masked man, dressed in black.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.061
He beat them all up.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.938
You mean one guy?

22:36.855 --> 22:41.485
I guess. Hard to say,
since it was dark and all.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.945
Well, did he say anything?

22:43.278 --> 22:44.613
No. Barely threw me the keys,

22:44.822 --> 22:46.657
so I could get
the hell out of there.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.617
So, he saved you?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.452
I guess.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.832
But there was quite enough
for an extra five hundred.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.835
Are you sure, that is all?

22:58.752 --> 23:01.421
Did you see or hear
anything else?

23:01.713 --> 23:04.299
No. Except the
hitting and punching.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.099
Oh yeah. I did hear in the yard,

23:12.307 --> 23:14.017
that there is a
big cargo shipment leaving

23:14.226 --> 23:15.477
from some VALA loading platform.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.522
This week,
some important shipment.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.525
What shipment? Vaccine?

23:22.192 --> 23:25.737
I don't know. I can't listen to
something they don't say.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.521
So, you took care of it then.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.031
So sorry for the bed.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.327
Well?

24:14.745 --> 24:17.497
Someone's stealing from us
and killing our people.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.125
And when I find out who,
I'll take care of it.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.753
Take care,
like you did with Kurikka?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.759
- I just need more time.
- More time?

24:29.635 --> 24:31.428
How many years more?

24:39.645 --> 24:43.065
I got this watch from my father,
when I was around thirty.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.652
<i>Old man was proud of the way</i>

24:46.860 --> 24:49.655
I handled that bang
in the marketplace.

24:52.032 --> 24:57.204
My father had got this from his
father, who had got it from his.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.666
This has been passed on
in our family for a long time.

25:01.291 --> 25:04.670
And it has always been
passed on to the son,

25:04.878 --> 25:08.173
if the son has proved
to be worthy of it.

25:10.842 --> 25:15.973
I just fear, that you are
never going to get this.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.684
I'll handle this.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.026
How about 221?

25:29.111 --> 25:31.822
Let's move it to the
other depot by the night.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.535
Let's go wait outside.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.607
Hey, did you hear that?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.393
Do you have two wieners in it?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.896
Of course.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.650
Hey, wiener face!

28:14.609 --> 28:16.945
Why do I have only one
wiener and he's got two?

28:19.322 --> 28:20.615
Goddamn.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.996
We're going now.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.840
What is it?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.179
Someone's found 221.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.065
What the fuck?

28:59.279 --> 29:03.867
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fucking fuck! Fuck's sake!

29:33.313 --> 29:35.690
Tell me, how many knew of 221?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.068
Not many.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.905
We have a problem.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.407
Someone's a snitch.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.621
Who the fuck does
something like this?

29:50.497 --> 29:51.831
We'll find out soon enough.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.837
Goddammit. If he's snitched
this car,

29:58.421 --> 30:00.590
then he's told about the
other one too, dammit.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.887
It's time to end this bullshit.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.238
Whiskey.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.993
- Fill it up?
- Yeah, I'm here, aren't I.

30:35.208 --> 30:41.089
Umm hey, excuse me. Do you mind,
if you'll put it exact?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.508
Look at that, it's the
credit man. I'm buying.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.760
- I'll take the same.
- Okay.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.346
Day drinking?

30:48.763 --> 30:51.933
Yeah. I got
a bit longer vacation.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.740
You still interested in numbers?

31:07.615 --> 31:09.868
Yeah. Why?

31:10.201 --> 31:13.038
Well, I have a need for a guy,
who can add things together.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.289
With numbers I mean.

31:14.789 --> 31:15.874
And I pay well.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.838
Here's my information,
if you're interested.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.134
Keep the rest.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.230
Alright monkeys, listen up.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.526
The contents of the cargo
is none of your business.

31:44.694 --> 31:51.451
Even one broken seal or
missing crate and that's it.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.454
<i>You don't talk about
your personal life,</i>

31:55.080 --> 31:58.875
<i>not your friends, not your
hobbies, not your women.</i>

31:59.125 --> 32:00.627
As long as you're
working for us,

32:00.835 --> 32:04.923
all you talk about is
about the work you are doing.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.133
What a fucking queer.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.951
You don't touch these vaccines.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.871
These aren't meant
for the white men.

32:37.664 --> 32:41.292
So to be clear, not one
syringe goes missing.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.639
Okay then, that was
such a rousing speech.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.308
Next up, you can all go
towards the factory there.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.646
Except you Réimii.
You'll stay here.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.696
I have arranged a bit cleaner
inside work for you.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.788
Alright.
You could start from here.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.541
So, start from here.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.668
Take receipts and bonds
to the safe,

33:23.877 --> 33:25.545
everything else to the shredder.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.422
What is that?

33:28.047 --> 33:31.593
Don't touch it. It's tarnite.
It's used to make the vaccine.

33:31.801 --> 33:32.802
It's really nasty stuff,

33:33.011 --> 33:34.554
and there
is way too much of it here.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.223
What the hell,
is it contagious somehow?

33:37.891 --> 33:40.602
Well, if you get it on you,
it won't come off.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.020
What, like nothing
won't get it off?

33:42.228 --> 33:43.438
You can't get it off at all.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.940
It integrates to
your cells, or something.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.234
I don't know,
something like that.

33:49.319 --> 33:49.986
Okay.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.530
But what I do know, is that
when that stuff dries up,

33:52.739 --> 33:53.740
it's harder than stone.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.827
Yeah, but.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.915
Hey, Kurikka. Thanks for this.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.876
Bullshit. Thanks to you.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.462
Before you came along, I
used to run all this by myself.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.964
What did you tell your family?

34:10.673 --> 34:13.426
That I work as a sorter in
the junkyard over there.

34:13.676 --> 34:16.221
Good. Keeping the low profile
is the most important thing.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.306
- Alright, bye.
- Yeah.

36:32.649 --> 36:35.026
Well? Are we going?

36:37.570 --> 36:39.280
<i>Or if you want,
we can skip this.</i>

36:40.114 --> 36:43.284
You can go back
to your lovely family

36:45.078 --> 36:47.163
and take a whiskey
and put the sauna ready.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.876
Yes. That will do it. Everything
will be okay by the morning.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.042
Who the fuck are you?

38:28.931 --> 38:30.975
Well? Did we get him?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.727
MAN: N0.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.531
- Are we going?
- Let's go.

39:25.988 --> 39:28.407
It had to be some sort
of special military sign

39:28.908 --> 39:30.785
because he did it
with two fingers.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.745
Oh really, with
two fingers, you say.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.705
Fuck, this sucks so much ass.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.290
Well, I think this is quite fun.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.544
- Quite cool actually.
- You got to be fucking kidding.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.088
Look at it, we got
fucking guns and all.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.257
No more cleaning
some dead bodies.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.967
We are squad leaders now.

39:46.259 --> 39:48.928
Fuck it. We are cannon fodder,
nothing more.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.305
That sounds cool too.

39:55.268 --> 39:56.644
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.776
- Should we bail?
- Yeah.

40:24.881 --> 40:25.840
Don't kill us.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.384
We haven't done anything wrong.

40:29.218 --> 40:32.013
Yeah, we haven't. We just
follow Rotikka's orders.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.267
<i>And he doesn't live anywhere.</i>

40:36.976 --> 40:38.895
<i>He just drives around in
that American car of his,</i>

40:39.103 --> 40:40.354
<i>so no one could
ever surprise him.</i>

40:40.688 --> 40:41.647
<i>He even eats in
different restaurants,</i>

40:41.856 --> 40:42.523
No, no, no!

40:42.732 --> 40:44.859
And bars, and sleeps
in weird places too.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.695
- And at the club.
- Yeah at the club. There he is.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.071
Way to go.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.612
Let's go.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.329
So you don't step at it when...

41:39.080 --> 41:39.997
Who's there?

41:42.917 --> 41:44.126
BOSS!

41:45.753 --> 41:48.714
Rotikka! Damn
we're glad you came.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.299
He left us alive.

42:15.825 --> 42:19.745
And you really thought, you
could handle this by yourself?

42:20.621 --> 42:21.580
Well, I set there...

42:21.789 --> 42:22.957
Rotikka!

42:23.374 --> 42:25.126
<i>That's a fitting name for you.</i>

42:25.334 --> 42:27.920
Arrogant beetle that
rolls around in shit.

42:29.088 --> 42:33.009
I sure could have had better
use for the sperm that made you.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.093
I got a picture of him...

42:34.343 --> 42:37.972
<i>A picture! ? But I needed
a corpse, not a portrait.</i>

42:39.849 --> 42:42.518
You have to do everything
by yourself, dammit.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.186
Radek.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.479
What?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.149
Radek.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.317
You're right.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.237
We'll get you some help.

42:53.612 --> 42:57.867
All you need to do, is to
give the scent for the dogs,

42:58.075 --> 42:59.577
<i>and then step aside.</i>

43:00.911 --> 43:02.038
<i>Do you understand?</i>

43:03.414 --> 43:05.374
- I understand.
- Good.

43:16.844 --> 43:17.928
Yes?

46:12.228 --> 46:13.771
See you later.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.197
<i>No.</i>

47:32.474 --> 47:33.392
<i>Daddy.</i>

47:35.227 --> 47:36.562
Daddy.

47:37.271 --> 47:38.022
<i>Daddy.</i>

47:39.023 --> 47:39.982
Enni.

47:40.232 --> 47:42.443
You were supposed to
read me the bedtime story.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.028
Well...

47:44.028 --> 47:45.195
I'll be there in a sec.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.781
Actually, why don't you
come here.

47:48.782 --> 47:49.742
Look.

47:49.992 --> 47:51.535
Guess what, I've fixed for you?

47:56.749 --> 47:58.125
But it used to be white.

47:58.459 --> 48:01.545
Yeah, but now it won't
ever break again.

48:03.922 --> 48:06.675
Besides, you can paint it
white, if you want to.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.012
No, this is just fine like this.

48:10.220 --> 48:10.971
You sure?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.723
Yeah, black is a good color.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.684
It's the color of the hero,
just like in the book.

48:16.018 --> 48:16.935
Okay.

48:16.935 --> 48:17.853
Good.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.773
Take it and go ahead.
I'll be there in a minute.

48:21.023 --> 48:21.648
Okay.

48:31.116 --> 48:34.745
<i>She moved like shadow,
and like a silent wind</i>

48:34.953 --> 48:38.123
she brought a spark
of hope in her wake.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.085
The evil forces of the village

48:41.293 --> 48:43.420
had finally got themselves
a challenger.

49:02.731 --> 49:04.817
The police is
pleased for now.

49:11.156 --> 49:12.783
Now get the hell
away from there.

49:22.126 --> 49:24.294
<i>Alright, it's time
to take tonight's</i>

49:24.503 --> 49:25.879
<i>first hero to the stage.</i>

49:26.171 --> 49:29.299
<i>Spank is singing
evergreen classic</i>

49:29.508 --> 49:31.927
Rusketusraidat from PMMP.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.304
Here you go, good luck.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.630
What!?

50:08.881 --> 50:10.174
Radek.

50:10.716 --> 50:11.675
What!?

50:21.268 --> 50:22.436
Radek.

51:06.438 --> 51:07.689
Reikki.

51:09.191 --> 51:10.609
What's the situation?

51:11.068 --> 51:12.444
Everything is secured.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.073
There they come.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.245
Look at that.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.377
Shut up.

53:01.970 --> 53:03.305
That went well.

53:10.854 --> 53:11.855
Now we're talking.

53:15.901 --> 53:19.196
Tell me, do you have fuzzy dice?

53:19.696 --> 53:21.323
I have fuzzy dice in my balls.

53:23.075 --> 53:24.576
Are those shoeboxes?

53:25.160 --> 53:26.328
Shut up.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.831
They've earned it.

53:41.259 --> 53:42.469
It's a trap.

53:49.267 --> 53:50.644
And we're leaving.

53:52.270 --> 53:53.397
Get to the car.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.024
Don't forget the champagne.

54:02.572 --> 54:03.490
Don't be stupid.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.642
Now kill him!

59:33.236 --> 59:35.030
Goodbye.

1:02:11.436 --> 1:02:12.604
You go that way.

1:02:23.531 --> 1:02:24.866
Here is one more!

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:28.620
Useless Russkie.

1:02:43.509 --> 1:02:45.136
There is still one missing.

1:03:50.743 --> 1:03:51.911
Well?

1:03:52.245 --> 1:03:53.579
What do you want?

1:03:56.124 --> 1:03:57.959
Did you come for this?

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.006
Oh, Réimii, Réimfi...

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:05.341
No! no! no, I10, I10!

1:04:07.260 --> 1:04:08.011
No! No!

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:09.012
Let them go!

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:12.265
Was there something unclear
about our employment contract?

1:04:12.265 --> 1:04:13.975
No. Nothing unclear.
Please, I beg of you.

1:04:14.309 --> 1:04:17.186
She's just a child, let her go.
She hasn't done anything.

1:04:19.814 --> 1:04:21.024
How about her?

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:35.747
I'm sure you're
going to feel this.

1:04:38.166 --> 1:04:39.375
Mommy!

1:04:40.251 --> 1:04:42.712
Anette! Anette, Anette!

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.005
Shut up!

1:04:46.341 --> 1:04:47.467
<i>Daddy.</i>

1:04:51.346 --> 1:04:52.638
This is your fault!

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:41.873
The city of Mikkeli
doesn't lose faith!

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:23.933
You're pathetic.

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:28.521
How in the world did you ever
think that you could do this?

1:10:23.511 --> 1:10:24.720
He sent you his regards.

1:10:27.139 --> 1:10:27.973
I just came by to tell

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.101
that things got fucked up
real good this time.

1:10:31.143 --> 1:10:32.353
So I heard.

1:10:35.022 --> 1:10:36.107
<i>You know.</i>

1:10:37.858 --> 1:10:42.113
I've done a lot of
bad things in my life.

1:10:42.405 --> 1:10:44.490
<i>But all of it had to be done.</i>

1:10:45.157 --> 1:10:47.368
<i>That is, if you
wanted to stay alive.</i>

1:10:48.369 --> 1:10:50.454
That sort of thing
changes a man.

1:10:52.039 --> 1:10:54.417
Defines who you are.

1:10:56.544 --> 1:10:57.670
But you.

1:11:04.468 --> 1:11:08.973
You're one dickless, brainless,

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:13.978
and useless fucking asshole
without any morals or honor.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:18.899
The only way you get any respect
is the name Erola! My name!

1:11:22.611 --> 1:11:26.741
You are the
greatest mistake I've made.

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:33.831
And I think that your mother
would have agreed,

1:11:34.874 --> 1:11:38.043
if she had survived giving
birth to you.

1:12:08.449 --> 1:12:10.117
Goddamn.

1:12:15.539 --> 1:12:17.458
You dickless piece of shit.

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:40.064
Oh, dear Pekka.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.865
It was quite nice,
for as long as it took.

1:12:52.076 --> 1:12:55.037
I too, have been part
of all sort of crap.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:58.707
But this really takes the cake.

1:12:59.166 --> 1:13:01.919
You really are
one piece of shit.

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:05.130
I mean, dear fucking god.

1:13:14.723 --> 1:13:16.517
Try to hang in there.

1:14:54.406 --> 1:14:56.075
You leaning on my car,
get the fuck off.

1:14:56.241 --> 1:14:56.951
What?

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:59.495
Now get your ass
the fuck away from there!

1:14:59.703 --> 1:15:01.080
Hey, relax now.

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:07.294
Dammit. What the hell
are you doing, man?

1:15:28.565 --> 1:15:30.192
Can I have the radio?

1:15:34.196 --> 1:15:35.447
Turn it on.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:43.706
Rotikka here.

1:15:45.332 --> 1:15:48.043
Every fucking guy, get
your ass to the factory, now.

1:15:48.544 --> 1:15:49.545
Everyone!

1:16:50.064 --> 1:16:52.024
<i>I couldn't get anything
outside Finland.</i>

1:16:52.775 --> 1:16:54.485
My contacts end here.

1:16:55.694 --> 1:16:57.821
But I managed to gather
all sorts of interesting stuff.

1:16:58.447 --> 1:16:59.364
And lots of it.

1:17:13.545 --> 1:17:15.756
I'll make sure the right
people gets their hands on this.

1:17:19.468 --> 1:17:21.178
There's the two million.

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:23.055
As a thank you.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:25.682
Or, well... almost two.

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:38.070
I can promise you
that I'll wheel myself

1:17:38.278 --> 1:17:40.114
as far from this city
as I fucking can.

1:17:40.322 --> 1:17:41.657
From this country.

1:17:42.699 --> 1:17:44.910
I'll set up a nice little
bordello somewhere.

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:47.037
Or a kennel.

1:17:49.373 --> 1:17:51.959
And you should stay far
away from that factory.

1:17:52.918 --> 1:17:54.670
I still have VALA's
radio frequencies.

1:17:55.963 --> 1:17:57.172
According to radio
communications,

1:17:57.381 --> 1:17:59.800
Rotikka has gathered
all of his firepower there.

1:18:00.092 --> 1:18:02.553
They're waiting for you
to drop by.

1:18:23.866 --> 1:18:25.993
What the hell is that
slackjaw waiting for!

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:26.345
Hey!

1:19:27.221 --> 1:19:28.639
Look at what I found.

1:19:32.559 --> 1:19:34.311
And what little birdie
we have here.

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:38.065
You're that reporter.

1:19:39.733 --> 1:19:41.360
Goddamn.

1:19:45.322 --> 1:19:46.073
Don't you realize that

1:19:46.281 --> 1:19:47.991
investigative journalism
is dead?

1:19:52.412 --> 1:19:53.830
Come here.

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:58.377
You see,

1:19:59.253 --> 1:20:01.171
I have this pain.

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:05.342
And no matter what I do,
it gets worse.

1:20:10.597 --> 1:20:12.599
Tie her to the forklift.

1:20:17.562 --> 1:20:18.647
Jarno.

1:20:23.193 --> 1:20:24.987
Your father is using you.

1:20:34.621 --> 1:20:38.208
No he's not. That's the
only thing he won't do.

1:20:42.504 --> 1:20:44.965
<i>Tie that pussy willow tightly.</i>

1:21:11.366 --> 1:21:14.369
Now we'll go
for a little joyride.

1:21:34.973 --> 1:21:35.807
Fuck it!

1:21:36.058 --> 1:21:38.977
Why won't these things work,
god dammit!

1:21:41.313 --> 1:21:42.522
Fuck.

1:21:46.610 --> 1:21:47.903
What the hell
are you looking at?

1:21:48.111 --> 1:21:51.573
Does the reporter need eyes,
huh? Do you? That's too bad.

1:22:18.141 --> 1:22:19.309
What the fuck?

1:22:20.018 --> 1:22:21.061
Hall 6 won't answer.

1:22:21.269 --> 1:22:21.978
What?!

1:22:22.229 --> 1:22:23.772
Hall 6 won't answer.

1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:39.079
Everyone to hall 6, now!

1:22:39.371 --> 1:22:41.248
Go, go, go!

1:22:43.542 --> 1:22:44.626
Move it!

1:23:53.528 --> 1:23:55.155
Someone, come in.

1:23:57.115 --> 1:23:58.366
<i>Come in!</i>

1:24:01.328 --> 1:24:02.954
<i>Fucking come in...</i>

1:24:13.089 --> 1:24:15.050
Fucking fuck.

1:24:54.506 --> 1:24:57.133
You do realize that,
this is a trap.

1:26:12.292 --> 1:26:13.793
Well, come on!

1:26:27.515 --> 1:26:28.933
You cocksucker!

1:26:35.023 --> 1:26:38.109
Goddammit! Fucking kill him!

1:27:23.071 --> 1:27:23.863
Hit him!

1:28:04.446 --> 1:28:05.947
Good, kill him!

1:29:00.001 --> 1:29:02.212
So, you think you're
a fucking superhero?

1:29:03.838 --> 1:29:05.131
Fuck.

1:29:15.683 --> 1:29:16.976
Goddamn.

1:30:11.364 --> 1:30:12.782
<i>You're pathetic!</i>

1:30:15.952 --> 1:30:18.288
<i>How in the world did you ever
think that you could do this?</i>

1:30:53.907 --> 1:30:55.533
Rip his head off!

1:31:00.413 --> 1:31:01.706
Kill him now!

1:36:42.088 --> 1:36:43.589
Goddamn!

1:37:05.444 --> 1:37:06.779
Now stay.

1:38:30.571 --> 1:38:32.031
This is who I am.

1:40:33.527 --> 1:40:34.987
I won't stop.

1:40:36.322 --> 1:40:37.490
Won't quit.

1:40:38.866 --> 1:40:40.618
Or give mercy.

1:40:41.327 --> 1:40:42.119
For I...

1:40:42.745 --> 1:40:43.704
am...
