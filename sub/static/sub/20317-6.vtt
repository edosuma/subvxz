things are just more important.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.356
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.632
Otherwise you end up
on your mate's sofa.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.432
Yeah, well, that was my decision,

20:12.560 --> 20:14.596
'cause I could have gone
on his top bunk, so...

20:15.680 --> 20:18.592
Have you spoken to Miche?
You two really need to talk.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.633
Nah, I ain't heard from her.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.710
- Did you have a good Valentine's Day?
- Yeah.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.675
Yeah?

20:26.560 --> 20:28.198
- Did you get any more cards?
- Three.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.475
Three?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.437
Did you have a nice day?

20:49.400 --> 20:52.358
Yeah. This is nice.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.552
ROCHE: <i>She loves you, you know.</i>

20:54.000 --> 20:55.831
Fuck knows why, but she does.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.712
You know, you two have
really got something,

21:00.120 --> 21:04.079
you've got far too much to just
let it fall by the wayside,

21:03.240 --> 21:06.152
and not, like, nurture it
like a garden, you know.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.838
You've got a garden of... (CHUCKLES)
Fuck. I am really fuckin' high.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.235
Yeah.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.310
- Of course, she loves me.
- ROCHE: Of course, she does.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.515
She worships me.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.589
- ROCHE: Well...
- I knew it.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.195
- I wouldn't say worship.
- You're right.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.873
I'm gonna get her back!
Yeah!

21:21.400 --> 21:22.549
He's gonna get her back!

21:24.120 --> 21:26.634
- Yeah. I'll take these as well.
- They're my flowers!

21:25.720 --> 21:27.119
Yeah,
you've seen them now anyway.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.751
Miche loves flowers... probably.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.637
- Good luck, mate!
- GRINDAH: Cheers, mate.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.392
- Grindah?
- Yeah?

21:33.720 --> 21:35.517
- Pure Kurruption.
- Each and every.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.955
Ooh.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.878
May love be with you forever.
See you later.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.909
(SIGHS) Ti-ti!

21:46.640 --> 21:48.471
Listen, you can leave early,
get out of here,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.234
I'll take care of everything.
I'll clean up.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.071
No, no, no, I can't
let you to do everything.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.349
No, it's fine.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.508
Listen, look,
it's Valentine's Day, yeah?

21:56.320 --> 21:58.390
You should be out there
getting wined or dined.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.309
- Not both?
- Hey! Definitely both.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.598
- You deserve both.
- (CHUCKLES) Nah, it's okay.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.388
Unless you've got
some weird reason

22:05.400 --> 22:06.435
for needing to get rid of me.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.950
Like you've booked
a stripper or something.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.554
(LAUGHS)

22:11.360 --> 22:12.873
No. I haven't done that for years.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.509
If I did want to treat myself
I'd probably go for an escort.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.713
It's more classier.

22:21.920 --> 22:22.989
(CHUCKLES)

22:26.440 --> 22:27.395
ROCHE: <i>Yeah.</i>

22:28.200 --> 22:29.758
- Yes, you lot.
- Yes, Steves.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.550
Oh, right, they're all coming in
to look at me like this today.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.434
- (CHUCKLES)
- I just came to see her.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.954
Put it there.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.154
Thanks for coming, man.

22:40.040 --> 22:40.995
Do you want to have a hold?

22:41.320 --> 22:42.389
- Can I hold her?
- Is that all right?

22:42.960 --> 22:44.154
Yeah, course it is.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.798
Just don't drop her. (CHUCKLES)

22:47.320 --> 22:48.594
That's your Uncle Steves.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.118
(BABY COOS)

22:56.360 --> 22:57.395
Got her?

23:02.880 --> 23:04.074
Hello, Nana.

23:04.880 --> 23:05.995
It's me.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.189
Steves.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.870
I'm gonna look
after your ring for you...

23:15.680 --> 23:17.477
until you're big enough
to wear it yourself.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.198
I've got your glasses, Nan.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.114
Circle of life, innit?

23:30.920 --> 23:34.310
Chabuds was right,
I knew you wouldn't go.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.399
Mm. Delicious.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.754
- Glad you like.
- Try it.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.714
- Open your mouth wide.
- No.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.513
(CHUCKLES) I'll do it myself.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.628
Can you taste the viagra?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.389
I'm only joking! I'm only joking!
(CHUCKLES)

23:48.960 --> 23:50.473
Viagra's pretty tasteless
anyway.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.672
Hm. Hey how about some wine?

23:52.360 --> 23:53.588
I can see what you're doing.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.111
What?
It's for her, it's for the nan.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.748
- Give her a little send off.
- Okay, go ahead.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.755
Mm.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.597
Okay stop! Stop, stop!

24:08.120 --> 24:09.678
Come on. It's for the nan,
for nan, for nan.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.150

24:14.040 --> 24:15.951
- (TIA SNIGGERS)

24:16.120 --> 24:17.997
You really get the taste
if you gargle wine.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.914
Really?

24:19.320 --> 24:20.594
(SIGHS)

24:21.880 --> 24:23.393
Now or never, really, innit?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.713
LIFT ANNOUNCER: <i>Doors opening.</i>

24:34.800 --> 24:35.869
(KNOCKS)

24:36.560 --> 24:38.118
I didn't know
you were coming over.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.396
- Is that all right?
- Yeah. I guess so.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.395
I got you these.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.631
- They're flowers.
- Thank you.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.234
And a vase as well?

24:49.520 --> 24:51.590
Yeah,
it sort of comes with them.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.353
(SIGHING)

24:54.880 --> 24:57.713
Look, Miche,
I just wanted to come over

24:57.760 --> 25:00.433
and just...
I just wanted to let you know

25:00.440 --> 25:02.908
that I'm ready for you
to take me back.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.989
Oh, right?

25:04.520 --> 25:06.988
Yeah, 'cause nothing really
that bad actually happened,

25:07.600 --> 25:10.478
and it's been ages now,
and I've said I'm sorry, so...

25:09.040 --> 25:10.268
No, you haven't.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.274
Well, I'm saying it now then!
Don't be all weird.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.876
The point is that Beats
and Roche have got a kid now

25:15.720 --> 25:17.312
and I can't really stay there
anymore,

25:19.800 --> 25:21.518
and I just want us
to get back together.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.831
But do you think
anything has actually changed?

25:23.080 --> 25:24.035
No.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.431
But that's the point, like,
nothing needs to change.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.715
We'll just go back to how it was.

25:27.840 --> 25:28.795
That's the whole point
of sorry, innit?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.189
That's not how it works.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.714
Well, do you want to explain
how it works to me?

25:32.680 --> 25:34.636
- Can I come in?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

25:33.920 --> 25:34.955
What?
Have you got a man there?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.079
- What?
- Of course not!

25:37.720 --> 25:39.631
The point is that
you don't give a shit.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.038
You're only here
because Beats kicked you out.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.277
It's not Beats' house,
it's Roche's house,

25:43.360 --> 25:45.032
and they didn't chuck me out,
they asked me to leave.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.189
You only care about yourself.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.473
You're so lucky to have me
and you haven't got a clue.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.394
Yeah, well,
maybe you ain't got a clue.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.592
- I deserve more than this.
- Yeah.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.709
Well, good luck trying to find
someone better than me.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.908
Fuck's sake.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.669
(EXHALES) Miche!

26:05.080 --> 26:06.593
Come on!
That's not what I meant.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.556
That's not how it's meant to happen.
Miche!

26:10.680 --> 26:11.635
Miche!

26:25.720 --> 26:29.076
Please, Miche... I'm sorry.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.109
I'll just take the stairs.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.715
If you're happy, yeah,
then you should just make sure

26:39.600 --> 26:40.555
that nothing changes.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.238
And just do
the same thing everyday

26:45.200 --> 26:46.394
for the rest of your life.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.954
Yeah, but change
is good though, innit?

26:49.560 --> 26:52.233
Like, sometimes it's good
to leave your comfort zone.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.880
Like, I didn't think
I would like Thai food.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.988
It's actually quite banging.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.029
All right, mate?

27:01.880 --> 27:03.029
Yep.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.995
MICHE: <i>Am I philosophical?</i>

27:05.160 --> 27:07.071
<i>Yeah, and that's why I think,</i>
<i>like, memes</i>

27:09.560 --> 27:11.152
<i>and sayings can really help out.</i>

27:12.240 --> 27:13.878
<i>"Dance like nobody's watching."</i>

27:17.200 --> 27:19.191

27:29.760 --> 27:30.875
You've got a bag?

27:32.360 --> 27:33.759
MICHE: <i>What's that?</i>

27:37.440 --> 27:40.352
- Valentine's card.
- Ah! It's beautiful. Thank you.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.633
- That's red.
- Is it?

27:56.120 --> 28:00.671
I believe that everyone
has a purpose on this earth,

27:59.640 --> 28:02.757
and that we will never know
what that is.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.598
- Thanks, Nan.
- What's that?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.390
Do you want one?
Helps you relax.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.670
<i>Because you could</i>
<i>spend your whole life thinking,</i>

28:13.080 --> 28:16.470
and you get to the end and your
brain turns off and that's it.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.348
So you might as well,
just chill out, enjoy it...

28:21.960 --> 28:22.949
a little bit.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.598
Yeah, go on then.
