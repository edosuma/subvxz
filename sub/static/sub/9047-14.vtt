00:02.268 --> 00:03.302
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:04.269
A barbecue is the perfect way

00:04.271 --> 00:06.572
To ease the weirdness.
- Go to the damn barbecue!

00:06.574 --> 00:08.874
- Your friends might need
some time to adjust.

00:08.876 --> 00:09.842
- What they need
is time with you.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.378
- They're not coming.
- You are totally taking sides!

00:12.380 --> 00:14.813
- We weren't taking sides,
but we are now,

00:14.815 --> 00:17.349
And we are not on yours.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.253
- Post de-friending my friends,

00:21.255 --> 00:25.190
My life had become
a little...Hazy.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.859
I was consumed with anger,

00:26.861 --> 00:32.631
Disappointment,
and the giggles.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.932
- This stuff is called
party hard-y,

00:33.934 --> 00:35.267
But don't let
the name fool you,

00:35.269 --> 00:38.170
Because it's
surprisingly mellow.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.540
- I'll pass.
I need a clear head.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.309
- For what,
your next diatribe

00:44.311 --> 00:47.179
About how much
your friends suck?

00:47.181 --> 00:49.882
- Yes!
- Come on.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.717
It'll help smooth you out.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.853
Then we can discuss the
pointless nothingness of life.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.056
- Collin was trying
to convince me to make the jump

00:57.058 --> 01:00.025
From my trauma train
onto his good time express.

01:00.027 --> 01:03.062
So what was holding me back?
Nothing.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.432
It was time for me to exhale
the hypocrisy of my friends,

01:06.434 --> 01:09.501
And inhale the wonders
of an herbal life.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.770
Hit me.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.009
[coughing]
- you got it.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.812
- While my anxiety had not yet
left the car,

01:19.814 --> 01:22.014
I was suddenly ready
to wax poetic

01:22.016 --> 01:24.817
On the trivial nature
of backstabbing friends.

01:24.819 --> 01:28.554
I was hopefully about
to be calm, cool, and...

01:28.556 --> 01:31.757
[siren chirps]

01:31.759 --> 01:34.126
Convicted.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.163
- Do you realize
how lucky you are

01:38.165 --> 01:40.632
That I went to high school
with officer mercado?

01:40.634 --> 01:44.803
And that he drove you home
instead of the station?

01:45.538 --> 01:46.238
- Yes, dad, I know.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.441
Evidently, some high school
friends were worth keeping.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.176
- Mm, did you say hi
to jerry for me?

01:51.178 --> 01:52.845
- Lace, I think keeping it
short and sweet

01:52.847 --> 01:54.513
Was in everyone's
best interests.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.948
- Should I go to my room now?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.850
Both: No!

01:57.852 --> 02:00.319
- Now, what did you
learn tonight?

02:00.321 --> 02:02.721
- I learned to make friends
in high places.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.124
- [laughs]
- what's so funny?

02:05.126 --> 02:08.627
- She said, "high places."

02:08.628 --> 02:09.661
Mm, oh, chips?

02:09.663 --> 02:10.863
Yes.
- [chuckles]

02:10.865 --> 02:14.433
- Jenna, don't be a smartass.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.636
You were just caught
with an illegal substance,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.304
Which you
should not be smoking.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.673
- Unless you're at home.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.307
- I'm confused.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.977
Are you guys condoning
my experimentation?

02:24.979 --> 02:25.711
- Absolutely not.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.679
I thought you were
smart enough not--

02:27.681 --> 02:30.215
- To get caught.
[snorts]

02:31.417 --> 02:34.419
- What's going on here?

02:34.421 --> 02:37.256
- We're disciplining you.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.626
- Without being hypocrites.

02:41.294 --> 02:44.229
- 'cause you're both high.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.199
- No.
- Yes.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.700
- Well listen, you don't have
to worry about me.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.370
I never want to be in the back
of a cop car again.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.638
It was traumatic.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.408
If I ever decide to do something
dumb, I will do it in private.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.443
- No! The--
- good! It--

02:58.445 --> 03:01.580
- Can I go to my room now?
Both: Yes.

03:01.582 --> 03:05.017
- But, uh,
leave the chips.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.318
- And no tv for a month!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.887
- No tv for a month?
- Or until I get pregnant.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.857
I've been watching documentaries
on how infrared radio waves

03:11.859 --> 03:14.293
Emitted from tv screens
can interfere with fertility.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.597
- So you're watching television
about not watching television.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.965
That's really smart.
- I know.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.634
[laughs] it's so much easier
than reading a book.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.003
- You should not have a baby.
- Why?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.005
- There are a multitude
of reasons,

03:27.007 --> 03:28.840
But let's start with
the obvious.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.075
You're a train wreck.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.610
- [gasps]
is that any way to talk

03:31.612 --> 03:35.414
To the woman who is raising you
while your mom is out of town?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.482
- Uncle dan is paying you!

03:37.484 --> 03:40.619
- And for good reason.
You're a pain in my ass.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.354
All you do is complain
and insult me.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.255
If you don't want my love,

03:43.257 --> 03:46.124
Then I'll just keep
the lunch I made you.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.226
- Nitrates and nicotine?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.261
- Cigs are appetite
suppressants,

03:49.263 --> 03:50.696
And that meat
is pure protein.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.598
Personally, I don't find it
all that appetizing,

03:52.600 --> 03:56.702
But then again, I'm not the one
with the slow metabolism.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.271
- Slut.
- Bitch.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.207
Have a good day, sweetie!

04:02.209 --> 04:04.042
- After my close call
with the law,

04:04.044 --> 04:05.744
All the problems
with tamara and ming

04:05.746 --> 04:07.045
Seemed like petty misdemeanors.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.947
And even though
I wanted an apology,

04:08.949 --> 04:13.552
My bigger need was to share
my nightmare with weed...

04:13.554 --> 04:15.320
And find out
who the hell was so

04:15.322 --> 04:18.490
Up close and personal
with matty.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.660
Is matty dating someone new?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.629
- You don't get to ask
who matty is dating.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.064
- But her name is devon.
Are you "devon-stated"?

04:26.066 --> 04:28.700
- No.
Matty can do whatever he wants.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.301
- But you can't!

04:29.303 --> 04:32.304
What are you doing right now
with this "nonchalant-itude"?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.605
You're not welcome
in our walk and talk.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.708
- Lookit, I almost got arrested
in collins's car last night,

04:36.710 --> 04:37.376
So just give me a break.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.578
- While your park'n'narc
sounds really interesting,

04:39.580 --> 04:41.413
And so fitting with
your new personality--

04:41.415 --> 04:44.583
- We don't want to hear it.
- In fact, we don't want to hear

04:44.585 --> 04:45.951
Anything but a big, fat,
"I'm sorry."

04:45.953 --> 04:47.452
Because if you think
we're gonna forget

04:47.454 --> 04:51.023
Your crazy-ass agro-yexting,
you're wrong.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.624
- Nobody likes a yell text.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.192
- I did not yell text.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.295
- Then explain this.

04:56.297 --> 04:56.895
"disloyal."

04:56.897 --> 04:58.830
- Exclamation.
- "unsupportive."

04:58.832 --> 04:59.798
- Exclamation.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.532
- "disloyal" again.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.201
- Exclamation.
- Oh, and "traitor,"

05:03.203 --> 05:05.671
Spelled "t-r-8-e-r."

05:05.673 --> 05:06.772
- 'cause you were angry,
and in a hurry.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.575
- Okay, so maybe I was yexting,
but I was feeling a little--

05:10.577 --> 05:12.077
Both: Betrayed!
- Exclamation.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.780
- Did you ever think
that maybe our no-show

05:14.782 --> 05:15.914
Had nothing
to do with collin,

05:15.916 --> 05:19.017
And maybe we had a good reason
for not coming to your barbecue?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.752
And we were going
to explain it to you,

05:20.754 --> 05:21.753
But you didn't
give us a chance

05:21.755 --> 05:22.921
Before your "piss-appointed"
tirade began?

05:22.923 --> 05:26.858
- Tamara and jake almost broke
up over your dangerous liaison.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.261
- Exclamation!
Jake was furious

05:29.263 --> 05:31.029
I didn't tell him
you were having an affair.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.398
You know why
I didn't tell him?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.199
'cause of girl code,

05:34.201 --> 05:36.401
Which clearly
means nothing to you.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.135
- Well, luckily for you,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.804
Girl code doesn't apply
to ex-friends.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.840
- Great! 'cause it was
exhausting being your friend!

05:41.842 --> 05:42.808
- Oh, and you're
such a dream?

05:42.810 --> 05:45.410
God, I am so glad I don't have
to listen to your endless

05:45.412 --> 05:47.779
And hopeless quest
to be popular.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.014
Way to set
your goals high, "t."

05:49.016 --> 05:53.752
- Don't "t" me.
You know what, jenna?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.755
Take care!

05:56.757 --> 05:57.589
- You take care!

05:57.591 --> 06:00.959
- So you guys are back
on good terms.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.229
Hey, look, why don't we get out
of dodge and take the edge off?

06:04.231 --> 06:05.931
- You want to ditch?
- Or skip.

06:05.933 --> 06:06.865
It's all just semantics.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.301
- I really don't want
to push my luck today.

06:09.303 --> 06:09.935
- Spread 'em!

06:09.937 --> 06:14.373
Jenna hamilton, you're under
arrest for skipping school.

06:14.375 --> 06:18.710
You have the right
to remain silent.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.312
- Are you making fun of me?

06:20.314 --> 06:22.914
- A little.
You know what?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.951
Maybe we should pick this up
after school.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.220
- Are you afraid of p.D.A.?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.488
- No, I just...

06:29.490 --> 06:31.423
I just don't think
it's appropriate for me

06:31.425 --> 06:34.626
To frisk you here in public.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.594
- Why?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.529
- Because I like to do
a thorough job.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.632
- Collin was attempting
to distract me from my drama,

06:40.634 --> 06:43.902
And with that distraction,
luckily came some action.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.238
The day could not end
soon enough.

06:46.240 --> 06:46.872
- It's over.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.941
I don't have any more
doctor's visits.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.009
- But your neck is crooked.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.179
- It's just a little kink.
It'll straighten out.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.882
I think.
- Ugh, gross.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.716
- Does it look that bad?

06:57.718 --> 07:01.286
- Not your neck.
Rental properties.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.554
I feel poor.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.189
- You are poor.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
When does your mom get back
from exhaustion camp?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.693
- Tonight, thank god!
I don't know what's worse,

07:08.695 --> 07:11.196
Living on a budget,
or with a bitch!

07:11.198 --> 07:12.264
- I'd say the budget,

07:12.266 --> 07:15.934
'cause you live
with yourself every day.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.036
- Hey.
- Jacques, I'm sorry.

07:18.038 --> 07:18.804
And I know you're sorry,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.238
And I really don't want
to fight anymore.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.107
I should have told you
jenna was a rankskank,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.141
But I was trying
to protect girl code.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.678
I just can't take fighting with
you and her at the same time,

07:26.680 --> 07:27.746
So please let's not fight.

07:27.748 --> 07:31.149
- I didn't realize
we were still fighting.

07:34.353 --> 07:35.887
- Hey.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.055
- Hey.
Hello, devon.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.657
- Hey.
- What's going on?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.492
- Just trying to get rid
of my anger towards jenna,

07:40.494 --> 07:41.326
But that's not happening.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.261
- Is that why
she's sitting by herself?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.697
- Don't feel bad for her.
- Okay.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.766
- Don't, matty.
- But it's jenna.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.768
- "exsqueeze" me,
that's not jenna.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.436
That's the girl
that cheated on you,

07:51.438 --> 07:53.638
Not to mention,
that girl almost got arrested.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.106
- She got arrested?

07:55.108 --> 07:56.374
- She almost did.
Same thing.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.610
- If you want
to talk to her, go.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.479
- You sure?
- You still care about her.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.780
Which totally makes sense.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.950
If you didn't,
you wouldn't be nearly as cute.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.387
- [sighs]

08:09.389 --> 08:10.222
Both: Big mistake.

08:10.224 --> 08:13.892
- I am sorry,
but I have to.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.136
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.072
- Is everything all right?

08:27.074 --> 08:30.375
Heard you got arrested.

08:30.377 --> 08:30.876
- Bitches.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.577
- Come on, they're just
worried about you.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.813
And so am I.
This isn't you.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.181
- No, this is me.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.381
They should mind
their own business,

08:37.384 --> 08:39.317
And frankly,
so should you.

08:39.318 --> 08:43.087
So go back to slumming it
with your rebound skank.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.661
- Get your facts straight,
jenna.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.163
I was slumming it with you.

08:52.165 --> 08:57.269
- ♪ within your bowl
of wisdom ♪

08:57.271 --> 08:59.170
- My life
as I knew it was over.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.573
So there was only
one thing to do--

09:01.575 --> 09:03.909
Remove myself
from the situation,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.944
And my "jenn-emies."

09:05.946 --> 09:07.913
- ♪ you think you have
a kingdom... ♪

09:07.915 --> 09:11.049
- Which was easier said
than done.

09:15.988 --> 09:16.788
- What are they doing here?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.490
- Ally had a fight with dan.
- Again?

09:18.492 --> 09:20.892
Did he finally realize you're
draining his bank account?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.828
- No, I'm trying to drain him,
for a baby.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.730
- But he wisely doesn't
want one.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.133
- God, it should be illegal
for you to have a baby.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.568
- And you,
little bitch,

09:29.570 --> 09:31.202
Are the best argument
for abortion.

09:31.204 --> 09:35.106
- Agreed.
- I'm going to my room.

09:37.143 --> 09:43.114
- What's up her butt?
- She's just...In a mood.

09:43.116 --> 09:43.615
Hon?

09:43.617 --> 09:46.751
Would you put your headphones on
so the adults can talk?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.421
- Are you two the adults?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.656
- After getting rubbed wrong
through the day,

09:51.658 --> 09:55.860
I was finally ready
to get rubbed right.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.206
- Ugh, wish that cop
hadn't taken my stash.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.407
- Sorry.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.343
Actually, I think
I might be able

10:11.345 --> 10:13.044
To find something
to hold you over.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.946
- Really?
Where?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
- My vag!

10:16.283 --> 10:19.451
It's a lemon, lace.
And freakin' ironic.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.387
To think about all the time
I spent sweating getting preggo.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.555
- Oh.
- Not to mention all the money

10:23.557 --> 10:27.058
I shelled out on propecia
when I thought I was.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.259
[laughs]

10:28.261 --> 10:30.161
And now the dream is done.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.530
- That is nonsense.
Adopt.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.265
- Adopting defeats the point.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.168
I only want a kid
I can screw up from the start.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.737
- Oh, this may be
a blessing, al.

10:38.739 --> 10:42.941
Before you know it, that baby
will hot box a car

10:42.943 --> 10:44.776
And almost get arrested.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.144
- Jenna got arrested?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.345
- [sputters]
- sadie.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.048
Why don't you go hang out
with little bitch?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.450
- Because she's
a bad influence on me.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.918
I'm appalled
that you would tell me

10:53.920 --> 10:55.987
To go hang out
with a delinquent.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.056
Kind of a poor parenting
decision, al.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.326
- Then go do your homework
in my room.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.898
- I'm gonna smother her
with a pillow tonight.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.141
- What are you doing in here?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.843
- What are you doing in here?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.379
Stealing your parents'
stockpile.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.814
Must be a new low.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.282
- Mind your own business.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.619
- Loser girl becomes
a loser burnout.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.888
You are such a cliche.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.489
- Give it a rest.
- Why?

11:31.491 --> 11:32.357
Did I hit a nerve?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.459
- Nothing you say could ever
get under my skin.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.162
- Good!
Then I'll leave you with this.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.732
Collin is gonna leave you
high and dry,

11:40.734 --> 11:41.766
Just like you did with matty,

11:41.768 --> 11:44.936
Because what goes around,
comes around,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.137
And karma's a bitch.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.207
- Is that why
you're broke and homeless?

11:51.977 --> 11:56.481
- Am I supposed to forbid her
to s--[sighs]

11:56.483 --> 11:57.015
Need something?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.617
- No, I just didn't want
to get in jenna's way.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.319
She seems really busy.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.520
- Doing what?

12:02.522 --> 12:05.090
- Swiping your stash.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.027
- So now you're stealing?
- It's more like borrowing.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.829
Besides, mom said
if I needed to smoke,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.131
I could smoke
inside the house.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.399
- I did say that.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.367
[phone chirps]

12:16.369 --> 12:17.202
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.136
Are we interrupting something?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.338
- That's my phone!
- Actually, it's mine,

12:20.340 --> 12:23.441
Because I bought it
and I pay the bills.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.643
Collin was over here today?

12:25.645 --> 12:26.845
- He stopped by after school.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.513
- That kid
is a bad influence.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.681
- You don't even know him.

12:29.683 --> 12:30.415
- Oh, I know enough!

12:30.417 --> 12:33.017
I don't want you seeing him
anymore.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.385
- Kev, let's not--

12:34.387 --> 12:37.021
- Go to your room.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.659
Not you.

12:43.229 --> 12:46.498
It's mine.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.201
[sighs]

12:50.203 --> 12:53.805
- My parents' hypocrisy
was at an all-time high.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.806
No pun intended.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.308
My top drawer score
had sent my dad pacing.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.645
And my mom, strangely...
[knock at door]

13:01.247 --> 13:02.280
To my rescue.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.916
- I thought your dad was being
a little too harsh.

13:04.918 --> 13:08.520
I want you to know that
I know you're a good kid,

13:08.522 --> 13:11.723
And I trust you.
- Thank you.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.291
- Can you do me a favor?

13:13.293 --> 13:13.892
- Sure.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.794
- Just lay low
on the collin front

13:15.796 --> 13:19.097
For a few days,
till this blows over.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.200
Can you do that?
- Not a problem.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.303
- Okay.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.910
[buttons clicking]

13:31.912 --> 13:35.814
- Hey, can you pick me up?

13:35.816 --> 13:36.815
Perfect.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.583
And don't come
to the front door,

13:38.585 --> 13:41.419
Just text me
when you get here.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.693
- I just
don't understand, you know?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.328
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.462
- Why doesn't
my dad trust me?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.864
First my friends,
and now my dad?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.667
Are all my relationships
conditional now?

13:55.669 --> 13:58.436
- It's not fair.
- [sighs]

13:58.438 --> 14:00.805
People break up, but your
friends are supposed to stay

14:00.807 --> 14:02.173
On your side,
not start hanging out

14:02.175 --> 14:03.675
With your ex's
new soccer slut.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.311
Did I tell you that devon
plays soccer too?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.412
He was probably flirting
with her

14:07.414 --> 14:08.246
While we were still together.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.849
That would explain
why he moved on so fast.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.150
- Hey, this is the fifth time

14:12.152 --> 14:14.752
You've brought up matty
and your friends.

14:14.754 --> 14:15.587
You're starting to fixate.

14:15.589 --> 14:18.690
- I'm--I'm not fixating.
- Talk to them.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.759
Or don't talk to them, but...

14:21.761 --> 14:23.661
Maybe you should
quit talking about it.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.064
- I'm never talking
to them again.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.800
- So let it go.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.134
Hey...

14:30.136 --> 14:36.040
How about we take
your mind off of this?

14:38.544 --> 14:42.680
- They just don't understand.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.984
- Maybe I should take you home
so you can deal with this.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.220
- No. No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.688
I'll shut up now.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.157
- Mom, you look great!
- I'm ecstatic.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.460
- Because you finally
got some rest?

14:55.462 --> 14:56.227
- Oh, hardly.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.430
- But wasn't that the point
of exhaustion camp?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.298
- Oh, it was a spa, honey.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.400
And I was only there
for a week this time.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.236
- But you've been gone
for almost a month.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.804
- Yeah, where the hell
have you been?

15:06.806 --> 15:10.241
- Santa fe.
- What the hell is in santa fe?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.377
- My boyfriend.
- So for weeks,

15:12.379 --> 15:14.012
I've been left alone
while you've been

15:14.014 --> 15:15.813
Shacking up with some hippy?

15:15.815 --> 15:16.948
- You weren't left alone.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.785
You had consuela, and uncle dan,
and...Abby.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.955
- Ally.
- And francois is not a hippy.

15:23.957 --> 15:24.622
He's a healer.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.191
- Well, he's not living with us.
- That's right,

15:27.193 --> 15:31.529
Because we are going to be
living with him in santa fe.

15:31.531 --> 15:35.066
- Over my dead body.
No way!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.568
- Are you really
gonna make this about you?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.938
Again?
Cut me some slack.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.141
[sighs] I'm the one
who's lost everything.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.175
- Oh, and I lost nothing?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.710
- Actually, you lost
three pounds

15:45.712 --> 15:46.945
From the lunches I made you.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.112
- I thought when you got back

15:48.114 --> 15:51.182
We could spend
some time together.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.317
- Of course.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.486
It's just gonna be
the two of us...

15:55.488 --> 15:56.587
On the plane.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.589
Now go get your things.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.525
- I think I'd rather
stay here tonight.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.060
- Sadie.
- It's okay.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.529
I can take her to school.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.997
- Fine.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.766
Sadie, I will meet you
at school tomorrow,

16:08.768 --> 16:13.137
And we can sign
the transfer papers.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.641
- [bleep] me.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.020
- Are you still thinking
about your friends?

16:29.022 --> 16:30.655
- No.
And I wasn't.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.658
I had finally left my head
and was starting to process

16:33.660 --> 16:35.860
How far we'd gotten
in collin's bed.

16:35.862 --> 16:36.728
- Hey, we don't have to do this.

16:36.730 --> 16:41.332
- I didn't know if I was ready
to add another notch to my belt,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.368
Or if I even wanted to.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.669
- You don't want to,

16:44.671 --> 16:47.672
And I don't want to
unless you do.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.073
So it's cool.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.208
- But it wasn't cool,

16:50.210 --> 16:52.377
And I didn't want
to lose collin.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.278
I couldn't lose collin.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.850
So I had to do
what I had to do to keep him.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.119
Hey.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.590
Do you have a condom?

17:06.593 --> 17:10.194
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.512
I had just had my first
after my first,

17:27.513 --> 17:30.648
And I needed to address
the undressing.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.789
I really need to talk.

17:39.691 --> 17:43.661
- I am done talking.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.962
- Mom, please,
just let me say something--

17:44.964 --> 17:46.664
- No, stop.
You need to listen.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.701
I defended you.
I trusted you.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.737
And you broke that trust.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.338
- I know,
but I can explain.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.841
- Explain it to your dad
when you wake him up

17:56.843 --> 18:00.545
And you tell him
that you snuck out!

18:00.547 --> 18:04.816
Jenna, go.
Now!

18:07.886 --> 18:08.786
- Honestly, I'm shocked...

18:08.788 --> 18:12.523
And thrilled
you're transferring!

18:13.158 --> 18:15.493
We are really
gonna miss you.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.261
- I want to emancipate.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.298
- Sorry to interrupt.
Sadie, you forgot your lunch

18:20.300 --> 18:22.166
And your anxiety meds.
- Keep it.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.869
- Emancipating isn't actually
as easy as it sounds.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.038
You can't just make
a proclamation.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.873
You still need
somewhere to stay.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.974
- I'll stay at lissa's.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.009
- Sorry, almost out of here,

18:32.011 --> 18:32.677
But I need clarity--

18:32.679 --> 18:36.214
Do you want me to keep
your lunch or your meds?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.648
- Both.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.717
- You have to have
a guardian over 18,

18:39.719 --> 18:41.385
And you can't just have
any guardian.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.687
I mean, if we're gonna
do this right,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.889
You'll need
someone superficial,

18:44.891 --> 18:49.293
Brutally honest, bitchy,
wealthy, fearless--

18:49.295 --> 18:50.795
- Wait a second.
That's me.

18:50.797 --> 18:55.066
That's exactly how I describe
myself on my facebook page.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.902
- Do you want her?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.705
- Oh, I don't know.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.444
Maybe.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.278
Yes!
[laughs]

19:07.280 --> 19:09.247
You see, I've been trying
to have a baby...

19:09.249 --> 19:10.515
- Oh.
- God, no.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.150
- But babies are
a lot of work,

19:12.152 --> 19:15.853
And sadie can
wipe her own ass.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.690
- Going once, going twice...

19:19.692 --> 19:22.593
Sold!
Sadie is your new baby.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.798
- Well, this seems like
a fine idea.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.034
Call me when you get settled.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.536
- I'm settled.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.906
- Well, then, um--
[chuckles]

19:34.908 --> 19:38.042
You let me know
what you need.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.745
- I tried.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.847
- What?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.216
- Nothing.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.252
- ♪ never wear it out

19:48.254 --> 19:50.555
♪ never shake it off

19:50.557 --> 19:52.290
- If I thought
almost being arrested

19:52.292 --> 19:55.059
Was the lowlight of my week,
I was wrong,

19:55.061 --> 19:58.529
Because my reality felt
like solitary confinement.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.698
And the only way
to break out of my prison

20:00.700 --> 20:03.701
Was to do the one thing
I didn't want to do--

20:03.703 --> 20:07.471
- Head's up.
- Apologize.

20:07.473 --> 20:12.977
Unfortunately, they weren't
exactly aiding or abetting.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.915
Hey, let's just
get out of here.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.184
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.087
I just need
to take the edge off.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.957
- ♪ in the darkness

20:25.959 --> 20:30.561
♪ maybe I won't even
go to work that day ♪

20:30.563 --> 20:36.667
♪ I don't care
if I'm in trouble at all ♪

20:38.570 --> 20:39.904
- Next, on <i>awkward...</i>
- I tried to stay out of it,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.906
But I can't just sit back
and watch jenna drift

20:41.908 --> 20:43.374
Into amanda bynes-ville.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.408
- So what are
we gonna do?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.610
- My afterschool special
video.

20:45.612 --> 20:50.514
- An uber-tragic tale about
a loser girl who wants to die,

20:50.516 --> 20:53.985
Called <i>what are we gonna do</i>
<i>about jenny?</i>

20:53.987 --> 20:57.054
- You've got to be
[bleep] kidding me.
