00:07.273 --> 00:09.707
- You call this a vacation?
- No.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.202
I call it Taco Island!

00:56.189 --> 00:58.054
Who's laughing now, bitch?

00:58.224 --> 01:00.385
- Piece-of-crap cable.
- What are you doing?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.826
- Maintenance. Shut up.
- No. Don't shake it up.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.260
Let the snow settle.

01:04.330 --> 01:07.060
That way you can see
the little San Francisco in there.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.432
Come here.
Let's see if we can see it together.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.032
It's not a snow globe, you ignoramus.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.870
How many TVs have you broken this year?

01:15.942 --> 01:19.275
A lot more than you have.
I'm teaching this object a lesson.

01:19.345 --> 01:22.940
If it doesn't want to get hit anymore,
it'll straighten up and fly right.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.007
- Isn't that right?
- That's odd.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.882
The connection on the cable feels fine.

01:26.953 --> 01:29.285
Of course it does,
because it's trying to trick you.

01:29.355 --> 01:32.916
You're falling for it, but not me.
Look at it. It's laughing at us.

01:32.992 --> 01:36.894
- It is laughing at me.
- Let's see how funny it is when I do this.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.225
There she goes.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.498
See? It just needed a good ass-whooping.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.667
We have successfully traveled eons...

01:49.742 --> 01:52.905
across both space and time,
through the Fargate...

01:53.346 --> 01:54.973
to get free cable.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.484
- I think it's a Stargate.
- It's the Fargate. "F".

01:58.751 --> 02:01.811
It's different from that movie,
which I have never seen.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.220
- How would I copy it?
- Chill, man. It's all right.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.314
Let's just turn it on.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.554
I just want to make sure
that we are clear it's the Fargate.

02:08.627 --> 02:09.993
Goes far, get it?

02:10.062 --> 02:13.294
And there is just no way
it came from that movie...

02:13.366 --> 02:16.597
or that syndicated series
based on the movie.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.704
- But it sure was a good movie.
- Yes, it was.

02:21.007 --> 02:24.704
- Turn on the TV. Maybe it's on.
- I don't have clearance for that.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.905
Yes. Only the inner circle
of high-ranking diplomats...

02:27.981 --> 02:31.280
with the security clearance
get to watch the big TV.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.843
You look away. Retinal scan on.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.950
Damn it! Wrong laser!

02:39.025 --> 02:41.755
- Why didn't you label them?
- You said don't label them...

02:41.828 --> 02:44.092
because it was top secret
and no one should know.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.688
Now you label them.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.063
- Where are my eyes?
- I've got them.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.462
- All right. It worked.
- Of course it worked, and it's free.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.606
Now let's have some fun watching it.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.302
Describe to me the action.
Does it excite your emotions?

02:57.377 --> 02:59.402
Is it funny or is it sad?

03:00.747 --> 03:04.342
- It's funny if you like public television.
- Public? No!

03:04.417 --> 03:07.113
Put my eyes in
so that I might furrow my brow...

03:07.187 --> 03:09.917
<i>und express the anger that I am feeling.</i>

03:10.390 --> 03:12.381
<i>Now change und channel.</i>

03:12.458 --> 03:14.688
That's, like, the one thing we can't do.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.061
But it's free, and that's cool, right?

03:18.131 --> 03:21.294
Get me the Universal Remonster.

03:22.068 --> 03:25.037
Shoot. We're still beta-testing that.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.800
What you're testing is me
and my patience.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.307
Get him out here now.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.073
Is this what you call a Remonster?

03:35.448 --> 03:37.473
Where are his claws and his fangs?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.075
He must have giant feet
and thirst for blood.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.781
- Now you've ruined my vision.
- Yeah.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.324
What if we just called him
the Universal Remobot?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.959
I mean, he is a robot.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.656
But the Remonster is his name.
It's branding.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.222
This monster thing
feels a little tacked on, actually.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.133
I mean, the T-shirts say,
"Universal Remonster"...

03:57.203 --> 04:00.070
not "Universal Piece of Crap"
like you'd say.

04:00.139 --> 04:04.098
- Wow, you made T-shirts. That's cool.
- Let me go get you one.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.441
Is that a Powerpuff Girl or something?

04:07.614 --> 04:10.139
Can you not see she has a Mohawk
and wheelchair?

04:10.216 --> 04:14.243
We are not getting sued.
Where's the Universal Remonster?

04:14.354 --> 04:16.947
I want him to have a baby tee and a visor.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.183
Oh, man.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.819
- I think he went through the Stargate.
- It is a Fargate!

04:21.894 --> 04:24.226
<i>From the makers of Findependence Day.</i>

04:24.297 --> 04:27.164
We will give it a Mohawk
and wheelchair if you need help...

04:27.233 --> 04:29.929
and tell the Remonster to do our bidding.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.898
He's gone.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.769
<i>Do our bidding, little Remonster!</i>

04:35.575 --> 04:36.701
Hello?

04:37.076 --> 04:39.169
Everything, this is all digital.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.280
<i>- Lean to your left.
- Okay.</i>

04:41.681 --> 04:44.081
<i>- Lean to your right.
- Right.</i>

04:44.350 --> 04:46.284
<i>- Lean to your left.
- Over here?</i>

04:46.919 --> 04:49.217
<i>- That's your right.
- Damn it. Okay.</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:51.280
<i>- Lean to your right.
- What about here?</i>

04:51.357 --> 04:53.825
<i>- You got it right.
- All right. Goody.</i>

04:53.893 --> 04:56.726
- That's good.
- I never get tired of hearing that.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.457
- What's this?
- That's your chair.

04:58.531 --> 05:02.695
- I mean, is it left or is it right?
- It's a chair and it's right over there.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.134
Think back to your song.

05:04.203 --> 05:05.795
- The song. Remember?
- What song?

05:05.872 --> 05:07.339
- What the hell?
- Watch this.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.433
Dawn is about to tell Carlos
she got breast cancer. Hang on.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.673
Wait. Watch this. He needs this for the...

05:13.746 --> 05:15.646
This is bowling. Don't watch this.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.183
- Why does it keep changing channels?
- It don't matter.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.311
I watch anything that's on.
Wait. Look at this here.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.549
This dude is gonna squeeze that boy
till blood comes out his eyes.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.882
Damn! Did you see that?

05:27.126 --> 05:30.095
- That's a mature situation.
- You ain't watching this.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.824
What are you doing? Go back.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.332
And turn it up, too, all the way.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.694
- All right. There you go.
- I didn't do it.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.704
- Then stop taking credit for it.
- Let me just test something.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.802
- It's back.
- All right. Good to go.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.776
- What're you doing?
- Will you knock it off?

05:45.845 --> 05:46.834
There we go.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.507
You are not to touch any button
on that ever again.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.980
Yeah. That's right. You go over there.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.645
Don't touch that plug!
What am I, a mirage?

05:54.721 --> 05:56.518
- What's that thing?
- What?

05:56.589 --> 06:00.081
- So you've been controlling the TV.
- Yes, because he's got good taste.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.287
- He's a cutie, too.
- Now you're gonna go back to 37, right?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.854
Because they got
the all-day blood buffet going on.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.400
- Meatwad doesn't need to watch that.
- Are you kidding?

06:08.468 --> 06:11.835
Babies aren't scared of this.
Bring me a baby. I'll prove it.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.064
Emory? Are you there, Emory?

06:15.141 --> 06:17.735
- I'm right here.
- Don't sneak up on me like that.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.301
I thought you were a monster on the TV.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.813
Why are we watching this?

06:21.881 --> 06:24.645
The Universal Remonster
probably picked it out.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.115
- He's into stuff like this.
- He's not a monster...

06:27.186 --> 06:30.155
because monsters are scary,
with claws and angry feet...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.987
because someone was too cheap
to get them for him.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.550
<i>- So you're talking about me?
- Nein.</i>

06:35.862 --> 06:40.390
I'm talking about the thing in the attic
that is stalking me.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.366
Please, what do you want with us?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.237
Let's let the chair do the work.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.274
I know you're getting a lot of use
out of the remote...

06:50.343 --> 06:52.607
but I need to run a few tests on it.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.738
- You're blocking the pretzel beam.
- Sorry.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.509
Thank you. Good landing.

06:57.583 --> 07:02.043
This remote, I tell you. It's ugly as hell,
but it fricking does everything.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.147
- Did you hear those chains rattling?
- Did that frighten you?

07:05.725 --> 07:07.283
Check this out.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.825
No! The chains from my dreams!

07:12.799 --> 07:15.461
Damn. You hit me in the chin.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.060
- Sorry. I thought you were a ghoul.
- I'm not.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.231
Well, it was your own damn fault
for making noises like a ghoul.

07:21.307 --> 07:22.899
Dude, I was flushing the toilet.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.103
Ghouls do that
when they're making brownies.

07:27.013 --> 07:30.540
Did you hear that?
He's in the attic now. He'll kill us.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.450
- Get the kitchen knife.
- The kitchen is in the attic.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.715
Great. Then he has the knife now.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.225
We've been watching too many
of these scary movies, maybe.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.854
I think we should chill out,
and let's have some more of this, all right?

07:43.930 --> 07:46.091
<i>Nein. Too much today.</i>

07:46.165 --> 07:48.998
Get rid of these monster movies
off the TV.

07:49.068 --> 07:52.765
<i>Prepare retinal scan. Ein, zwei, drei, go.</i>

07:52.839 --> 07:55.740
Damn it! I told you to label those buttons.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.901
My eyes are throbbing from the laser.

07:58.177 --> 08:00.907
Why do we put the lasers there?
We're asking for trouble.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.210
What the hell?
Someone is stealing our cable.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.683
Please don't. Stop it!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.045
No. What's happening?

08:09.121 --> 08:11.555
Frylock! Get over here.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.785
You're missing it. Check it out.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.852
I got a limb ripping,
screaming on the rack...

08:17.263 --> 08:19.128
and three kinds of Satan laughs.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.723
Last time I'm gonna tell you, Shake.
Stop doing that.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.395
I can't,
and you should respect my addiction.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.764
It's a disease.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.569
I need help, but just not right now, okay?

08:30.810 --> 08:33.836
Come on. We almost flatlined him.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.881
Come on, you stupid-ass piece of junk.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.280
I guess the batteries
are finally running low.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.818
No. He's being lazy is what he's doing.

08:40.886 --> 08:43.253
Did you all see
a ghost pass through here...

08:43.556 --> 08:45.751
'cause I've been hoping like hell
that he's gone.

08:45.825 --> 08:49.283
He probably went to the store
to get some more food for his demons.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.351
Are you serious?

08:50.429 --> 08:52.624
You do know
where the demon food store is, right?

08:52.698 --> 08:54.723
- What are you talking about?
- Behind you.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.290
- You're in it.
- I'm in the store.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.098
You're in the demon produce aisle.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.104
I think I know
where that remote came from.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.369
Go get some more of them.
I'm having to improvise over here.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.875
Listen. It's coming from inside the house.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.345
- Yeah, it is.
- Did you hear that?

09:08.414 --> 09:12.544
Someone just said, "Yeah, it is".
A demon. Get out! A demon!

09:12.618 --> 09:15.212
Do you happen to know the penalty
for stealing cable?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.448
Cable?

09:17.089 --> 09:19.990
We have technology
beyond our comprehension.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.494
Behold the light stick.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.862
It's not lighting, Emory.
I don't know what's wrong with it.

09:27.934 --> 09:28.958
You broke it on my head.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.936
Get the Universal Remonster.
He knows how to do it.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.528
- He's dead.
- Impossible.

09:33.606 --> 09:37.098
The Remonster can only be killed
by stabbing him in the heart...

09:37.176 --> 09:40.373
with the ancient bone saber of Zumacalis.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.716
Probably his head and lungs, too.
Just stab him wherever.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.082
And the saber probably
doesn't have to be bone.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.451
Just anything sharp
lying around the house.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.820
You could poke him with a pillow
and kill him.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.383
- Or his batteries could've just run out.
- No. He's dead!

09:55.695 --> 09:58.562
The monster is dead, now and forever.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.122
- There we go.
- The TV is dead.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.896
Death. We are surrounded by it!

10:03.970 --> 10:07.497
Look. You don't need TV.
It just ends up owning you.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.872
- Next time you get bored read a book.
- We have no need to read.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.071
Behold the Mohawk of eternity!

10:15.081 --> 10:17.811
- You guys are high.
- No, dude.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.374
Why, man? Are you cool?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.284
- Yes. Are you cool?
- I'm out of here.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.688
Wait. Do you have any snack cakes
or corn-flavored chips?

10:25.758 --> 10:29.125
- I'm fricking starving here.
- See if he's got some mini-pizzas.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.389
Yes. Mini-pizzas.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.829
That would taste good to my palate. No!

10:32.898 --> 10:35.093
I think I finally found a good use
for the TV.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.364
- You put that right back upstairs.
- No.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.840
Then you are gonna help me
pull down my chair down here...

10:43.909 --> 10:46.469
- so I can watch it here.
- No, I won't.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.413
I will pee all over my pants...

10:52.485 --> 10:55.852
and then who's gonna end up looking bad?

10:55.921 --> 10:58.253
Just stay down here with your TV
and... it then.
