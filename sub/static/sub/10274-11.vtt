00:02.590 --> 00:04.478
-A few months ago, a
family was murdered

00:04.480 --> 00:06.198
in a hotel in Alexandria.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.246
-Wasn't there a son?

00:07.250 --> 00:09.684
-Yeah, he was down at the
pool when it happened.

00:09.690 --> 00:12.158
Didn't see anything until
he came up and found them.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.926
-Have you ever seen
these people before?

00:15.930 --> 00:18.319
I'm Ann Chadwick from the
child advocacy centre.

00:18.320 --> 00:23.986
-Healing, it's gonna take time. -I'm sorry
you have to work with Captain Larrick.

00:23.990 --> 00:27.141
He's dangerous and unpredictable
and puts you and your family

00:27.150 --> 00:27.844
at risk.

00:27.850 --> 00:28.919
-You back already?

00:28.930 --> 00:30.886
-Yeah, I had a
personal emergency.

00:38.660 --> 00:39.649
-Hello?

00:39.650 --> 00:41.242
-Hey, is Bobby there?

00:41.250 --> 00:41.944
-Bobby who?

03:57.750 --> 03:59.297
-How was study group?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.541
-Fine.

04:01.550 --> 04:02.960
-There's lasagna
in the refrigerator

04:02.970 --> 04:04.756
if you want me to
heat anything up.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.888
-I'm not hungry.

04:07.890 --> 04:08.857
Can I ask you question?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.938
Why won't you let me go
to the summer retreat?

04:14.940 --> 04:17.454
-Because I don't think
it's the right thing

04:17.460 --> 04:19.109
for you to do this summer.

04:19.120 --> 04:19.939
-But why?

04:19.950 --> 04:22.214
Can you give me one
good reason why?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.061
-Because I'm your mother.

04:47.650 --> 04:52.394
-The FBI knows about
Emmett and Leanne.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.753
-Are you sure?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.318
-Yeah, bug's back up.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.347
I mean, the sound
quality is a little off.

04:59.350 --> 05:02.285
They were talking about
it in Gaad's office.

05:02.290 --> 05:05.589
And they know that Emmett
and Leanne work for the KGB.

05:05.590 --> 05:09.697
And Stan Beeman paid
their son a visit.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.635
-Shit.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.427
-I signalled the centre.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.921
-What did they say?

05:17.930 --> 05:18.828
-I haven't heard back yet.

05:26.810 --> 05:27.811
-I'm gonna go see Jared.

05:27.820 --> 05:28.718
-No,no.

05:28.730 --> 05:30.243
It is too rislq right now.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.774
He could be under surveillance.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.669
-If he is, I'll see
that, and I'll stay away.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.874
The centre's gonna
want to know what

05:35.880 --> 05:38.383
Stan said to him
about his parents.

05:39.930 --> 05:42.273
for that in the next 24 hours?

05:42.280 --> 05:42.974
I want to know.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.625
I never gave him
Leanne's letter.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.388
-You did what you
thought was best.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.189
-I made a promise.

06:07.840 --> 06:12.903
-And now he may have found
out from an American.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.434
-Sir.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.777
Emmit Conners died
at the age of four

07:00.780 --> 07:03.943
from a raccoon bit, rabies.

07:03.950 --> 07:07.124
His KGB partner assumed the
identity of Leanne Riley who

07:07.130 --> 07:09.360
died at birth in
Springfield, Missouri.

07:09.370 --> 07:12.089
-What did her
autopsy report say?

07:12.100 --> 07:14.568
-No scar from a bullet
wound on her torso.

07:14.580 --> 07:15.581
-You should be happy.

07:15.590 --> 07:17.490
Your girl was telling the truth.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.728
-Yep.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.628
-On the other hand, how
the hell many illegals

07:20.640 --> 07:21.652
are there in the DC area?

07:21.660 --> 07:22.354
Four?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.156
Six?

07:23.160 --> 07:23.854
A dozen?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.992
Are you all right, Beeman?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.046
-I'm fine, sir.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.354
Things are a little
unsettled at home.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.726
-Ah.

07:39.730 --> 07:42.654
Marriage, no timeouts.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.945
-No.

07:43.950 --> 07:45.952
-I've been married 17 years.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.804
Happily, for the most part.

07:48.810 --> 07:49.549
Luck of the draw.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.241
Here.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.467
-What's this?

08:03.470 --> 08:05.438
-Your commendation.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.489
The agency's way of saying thank
you for dispatching Dameran.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.783
-Why are you here?

09:50.790 --> 09:52.974
-Just to see you.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.437
See how you're doing.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.965
What's new?

09:57.970 --> 10:01.110
-Uh, what do you mean?

10:01.120 --> 10:03.338
-How's school?

10:03.340 --> 10:04.022
-OK.

10:08.110 --> 10:11.204
A FBI agent came to see me.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.552
-Rea|ly?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.642
Why?

10:14.650 --> 10:17.574
-He said it has something
to do with the murders.

10:17.580 --> 10:18.695
-What?

10:18.700 --> 10:19.394
-I don't know.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.094
He didn't say.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.539
-It upset you?

10:32.990 --> 10:34.469
-Yeah

10:34.470 --> 10:35.471
-What did he want to know?

10:38.060 --> 10:43.441
-Um, uh, he showed
me-- he showed me

10:43.450 --> 10:46.055
two drawings of people
and some photos.

10:46.060 --> 10:48.927
-Your parents?

10:48.930 --> 10:49.908
-No, somebody else.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.594
I don't know.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.579
He just-- he just wanted to
know if I'd seen them before.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.549
If I knew who they were.

11:01.550 --> 11:04.428
-Do you?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.124
-No.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.019
I'm not stupid.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.547
-I know you're not.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.744
-I don't know what's
gomg on, but I

11:17.750 --> 11:19.149
want to know what's going on.

11:24.630 --> 11:27.292
-Did he say anything
else, the FBI agent?

11:29.870 --> 11:33.169
-Yeah, he said I should call
him ifI remembered anything

11:33.180 --> 11:34.852
or if anything
suspicious happened.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.389
-I scoured the budgets on
our aeronautics programs

11:44.400 --> 11:47.198
and found an anomaly
in one numbered C212.

11:47.210 --> 11:52.568
It's a category of $100 million
coded as non-accountable.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.877
-What does that mean?

11:54.730 --> 11:57.221
Either the bean counters
at Lockheed don't know

11:57.230 --> 11:59.243
or they don't want me to know.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.959
-$100 million would
create a large hole.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.996
-That's of expenditures
but against what?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.503
There's no-- there's
no goods, no servnces,

12:07.510 --> 12:08.659
there's not even a code name.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.879
It really makes you feel like
there's a flashing red light.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.108
-Stealth?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.769
-I don't know what
else it could be.

12:14.770 --> 12:17.716
-Do you think you
could find out?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.768
-I'm the numbers guy.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.989
There's no way I
can get into that.

12:22.990 --> 12:26.847
There's a guy, John Skeevers,
an aeronautics engineer.

12:26.850 --> 12:27.544
Brilliant.

12:27.550 --> 12:28.801
He worked for
Lockheed for years.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.619
We both like fly fishing.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.076
He helped develop the SR71.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.445
-Uh, the spy plant?

12:33.450 --> 12:35.441
-Yeah, it had
features that helped

12:35.450 --> 12:37.168
reduce its radar signature.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.092
-So where is he now?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.499
-He's going through a bad time.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.219
Bitter divorce and then he
got the double whammy, cancer.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.962
Started making crackpot
claims about how

12:46.970 --> 12:48.926
the company poisoned him.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.420
So they invited him to leave.

13:58.900 --> 14:02.392
Nurse Barnes.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.958
Nurse Barnes.

14:18.410 --> 14:20.219
-Aliens, uh?

14:20.220 --> 14:21.494
You believe they're out there?

14:27.630 --> 14:30.702
-There's a lot out _there
you wouldn't believe.

14:30.710 --> 14:35.158
-Yeah, like they got time
to shove a probe up the ass

14:35.170 --> 14:36.876
of some hayseed that
fell off a turnip truck.

14:40.870 --> 14:43.259
Yeah, government and military.

14:43.260 --> 14:44.534
They're all in on it.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.380
Oh, I was in Vietnam.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.709
Strange brew, man.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.314
Hamburger hill
messed up my head.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.617
Turned it inside out.

14:57.370 --> 14:59.315
-Poisoned me.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.014
-Who?

15:03.350 --> 15:05.864
-They'll deny it.

15:05.870 --> 15:08.134
Say it's unrelated with cancer.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.614
Anecdotal.

15:14.210 --> 15:14.904
-Bastards.

15:14.910 --> 15:15.604
-96?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.979
-You.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.129
-96.

15:29.130 --> 15:29.824
-That's you, man.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.174
-96!

15:38.580 --> 15:41.003
-Sorry.

15:41.010 --> 15:43.706
Nurse
Chow please report to room 302.

15:43.710 --> 16:02.346
Nurse Chow to room 302.

16:02.350 --> 16:05.456
-Goddamn wallet.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.154
-Sorry, sir.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.640
This isn't enough.

16:08.650 --> 16:10.015
-Well, how much is enough?

16:10.020 --> 16:12.989
-How short is he?

16:13.000 --> 16:22.602
-$277.

16:22.610 --> 16:23.520
-You all right?

16:30.860 --> 16:32.020
-I don't know what
happened to it.

16:32.030 --> 16:32.724
-You're OK.

16:32.730 --> 16:33.708
It's OK.

16:36.650 --> 16:37.628
-Thank you.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.334
-Hey.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.181
Yeah, I just get side swiped
with a overwhelming urge

18:24.190 --> 18:26.249
for PB&B, actually.

18:26.260 --> 18:27.079
Peanut butter and banana.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.271
How much longer are you
not gonna talk to me?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.009
-What do you want me to say?

18:40.010 --> 18:42.149
I have nothing to say.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.128
-Paige.

18:43.130 --> 18:44.392
-Am I supposed to
talk to you whenever

18:44.400 --> 18:45.651
you want to talk to me?

18:45.660 --> 18:48.231
Is that a rule because I
wasn't aware of that rule.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.196
-You don't have
to act like this.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.349
-I'm prisoner in my own house.

18:51.350 --> 18:52.567
How am I supposed to act?

18:59.550 --> 19:00.335
-Hello?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.034
-He seems OK.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.827
He was shown drawings and
photos of a man and a woman.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.536
Asked if he'd ever
seen them before.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.145
-And you think it's--

19:08.150 --> 19:09.594
-Could be.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.603
-Well, did he say
he'd seen them?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.304
-No.

19:13.310 --> 19:15.801
But, uh--

19:15.810 --> 19:17.300
-What?

19:17.310 --> 19:20.780
-Just the way he looked at me.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.258
It's probably nothing.

19:25.730 --> 19:26.981
-What?

19:26.990 --> 19:28.548
-I saw him with her.

19:28.550 --> 19:29.858
Maybe they're just
a step ahead of us.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.430
They're supposed to
be taking care of him.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.089
-You don't sound so sure.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.670
-She hadn't done
anything to make

19:34.680 --> 19:37.660
herself look any
different to him.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.149
She was just herself.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.309
-Hello?

21:57.320 --> 21:58.799
-It's Phillip.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.494
-Oh, hey.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.194
Come on in.

22:00.200 --> 22:00.928
It's open.

22:00.930 --> 22:01.624
-Hey.

22:01.630 --> 22:02.824
-Hey.

22:02.830 --> 22:03.535
-Quick question.

22:03.540 --> 22:04.234
-Yeah.

22:04.240 --> 22:09.416
So Henry has to write a report
for school about my hero.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.956
Naturally, I thought
I'd be the shoe-in.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.257
But you can't write
about your dad,

22:12.260 --> 22:16.776
so_he would like
to InterVIew you.

22:16.780 --> 22:17.792
-Wow.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.370
I'm flattered.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.291
-Well I'm envious because you
made quite the impression.

22:21.300 --> 22:26.681
But I guess a travel agent
can't compete with the FBI.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.170
-Except when it comes to cars.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.978
-So uh, what's new?

22:31.990 --> 22:33.412
-Nothing much.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.648
You?

22:34.660 --> 22:35.649
-Can't complain.

22:35.650 --> 22:36.389
Do.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.321
Is Sandra home?

22:37.330 --> 22:38.376
-Uh,no.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.881
Not yet.

22:39.890 --> 22:42.393
No.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.549
Hey, you want a
beer or something?

22:43.560 --> 22:44.254
-Sure.

25:09.450 --> 25:10.144
-What's wrong?

25:10.150 --> 25:11.458
-Can't reach George.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.961
-Did you leave a message?

25:12.970 --> 25:14.426
Been trying for the
past three hours.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.853
His answering machine's off.

25:16.860 --> 25:18.168
Left her a signal.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.638
It's funny about George.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.267
I'll try again in two hours.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.716
If it's still off, we
should radio the centre.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.278
-Might be a power
out or something.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.851
But yeah, OK.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.227
I uh, I think we
should let Paige

25:32.230 --> 25:33.709
be a counsellor at
the church camp.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.861
It's only for a summer.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.076
-Have you said something to her?

25:39.080 --> 25:39.774
-No.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.247
-We already said no.

25:41.250 --> 25:41.944
-I know that.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.759
But I think it would
show that we trust her.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.592
-I won't let her be
indoctrinated by the church.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.692
They get them when
they're young.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.394
It's what they do.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.412
You know it's what they do.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.024
-I just don't want
to crush her spirit.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.707
-I can't do it.

26:03.710 --> 26:04.404
I won't.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.707
-You know where to hide things.

26:13.710 --> 26:14.404
I'll give you that.

26:18.550 --> 26:22.145
You people destroyed my life.

26:22.150 --> 26:23.344
Not that I didn't
have a hand in it.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.395
An unwilling hand.

26:28.400 --> 26:35.249
But I made my bed, and now
I will have to lie in it,

26:35.250 --> 26:35.978
as will you.

26:48.450 --> 26:49.144
Frequencies.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.360
And when's your
next transmission?

26:56.370 --> 26:58.804
They repeat, don't they?

26:58.810 --> 26:59.742
Every hour or so?

27:02.280 --> 27:04.157
The agent in the
fields convenience.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.605
Decoding with a one time pad.

27:11.610 --> 27:12.599
I've always hated this.

27:36.010 --> 27:37.295
-Hi.

27:37.300 --> 27:37.994
-Hey.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.981
-Uh, where's Matthew?

27:42.990 --> 27:47.359
-Uh, he's at Harry's house.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.327
-What's that?

27:50.940 --> 27:51.634
-Nothing.

27:51.640 --> 27:52.470
Just work.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.260
-Please don't ask me anything
you don't want to know.

28:11.600 --> 28:17.368
These, um, past months
have been a real gut check.

28:19.950 --> 28:40.338
I um, I feel-- I felt-- I'm
not looking for sympathy.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.932
And I'm not trying
to place blame.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.067
Don't you?

28:52.070 --> 28:52.764
-Yeah.

28:59.230 --> 29:05.908
So are we done?

29:13.080 --> 29:14.502
-I don't know.

29:14.510 --> 29:15.920
I don't know how you're
supposed to know.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.859
Do you?

29:21.870 --> 29:22.564
-No.

29:28.340 --> 29:29.898
-I know I feel
better about myself.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.978
-I'm glad.

29:49.750 --> 29:52.389
-OK.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.389
You want to hear your message?

29:57.610 --> 30:02.309
Your bosses in Moscow say he can
connect with answering service.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.811
Report similar issues.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.253
Well that's going
to be a problem

30:06.260 --> 30:10.674
because the answering
service is shut down.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.422
I can feel them getting nervous.

30:17.430 --> 30:18.385
Can you?

30:22.310 --> 30:25.063
Next, they're not going
to be able to find you.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.651
And that's really going
to make them jumpy.

30:33.550 --> 30:39.022
Now you know it's
not you that I want.

30:39.030 --> 30:41.942
It's the scum bags
who killed my friends.

30:47.590 --> 30:48.284
Where are they?

30:52.430 --> 30:56.161
You didn't leave any
evidence of them around?

30:56.170 --> 30:59.628
Not even in your little
compartment over there?

30:59.630 --> 31:03.077
Hey, you were good at your job.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.047
Where are they?

33:32.060 --> 33:34.540
-What do you want?

33:34.550 --> 33:37.963
-Found it in the clinic
under your chair.

33:37.970 --> 33:40.541
It must have fallen out.

33:40.550 --> 33:41.721
And uh, I got soup.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.349
Can I come in?

34:04.390 --> 34:07.097
Are you, uh-- you hungry?

34:07.100 --> 34:08.260
-No.

34:08.270 --> 34:10.079
-Oh, you good.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.379
You got to eat to
help your strength.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.074
Sit down.

34:17.270 --> 34:19.238
-Who are you?

34:19.240 --> 34:21.595
-Ted.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.794
-Do I know you?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.121
-Uh, yeah we met at the clinic.

34:29.940 --> 34:30.872
Oh, wow.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.338
You got enough pills
here to choke a horse.

34:34.350 --> 34:35.806
Come eat before it gets cold.

34:35.810 --> 34:36.799
It's good.

34:40.510 --> 34:43.195
-Memory's shot.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.430
Cancer spread.

34:49.450 --> 34:50.291
It's in my brain.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.125
That's what killed the bats.

35:02.590 --> 35:03.545
You got kids?

35:03.550 --> 35:04.244
-Uh, yeah.

35:08.530 --> 35:10.657
-Leave them something
beside a heartache.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.375
-I ain't gonna
help you with that.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.085
-With what?

35:18.140 --> 35:18.834
-Money.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.011
Why didn't you
tell me about RAM?

35:36.420 --> 35:39.298
-I don't know about that.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.198
You worked, um, SR71.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.899
-They poisoned me.

35:46.900 --> 35:47.696
Tossed me away.

36:06.780 --> 36:08.759
-Who are you?

36:08.760 --> 36:09.749
-Does it matter?

36:25.470 --> 36:26.164
-It didn't work.

36:28.970 --> 36:30.699
-Ram didn't work?

36:30.710 --> 36:32.325
-It's too heavy.

36:32.330 --> 36:34.981
Clunlq.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.390
It's in my brain.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.515
-I'm sorry.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.500
-Made out of tiles.

36:45.510 --> 36:48.411
Hard stuff but it didn't works.

36:48.420 --> 36:54.438
So he tried these
tiny little balls.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.134
Microscopic.

36:59.070 --> 37:05.020
Iron-ball paint It's
what killed them.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.868
-Ki|led who?

37:10.870 --> 37:13.430
-Bats.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.328
Dead bats all over the floor.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.342
From the fumes.

37:21.350 --> 37:23.170
-From the paint fumes.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.740
-Yeah that's what
did it-- paint.

37:28.450 --> 37:33.274
Absorbs the radar high as
the planes and kill the rats.

37:36.870 --> 37:37.871
And killed me too.

37:49.070 --> 37:49.764
-In here.

37:57.350 --> 37:58.999
-It's paint.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.048
Radar absorbent material.

38:01.050 --> 38:04.292
Microscopic iron balls
suspended in paint.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.734
-The centre hasn't
heard from Kate.

38:06.740 --> 38:09.038
She didn't make a
scheduled transmission.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.314
That's not unusual.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.014
Except we haven't--

38:11.020 --> 38:13.238
-Still nothing from George.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.582
-So what the hell's going on?

38:15.590 --> 38:16.761
-They just sent us her address.

38:16.770 --> 38:17.759
I think we need--

38:26.730 --> 38:29.483
-I understand you
have control over me.

38:29.490 --> 38:33.278
What I do, where I go, and
who I see until I'm 18.

38:33.280 --> 38:41.437
But who I am and what I think
and feel and believe is mine.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.134
I'm me.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.078
There's a protest
at an Air Force

38:48.080 --> 38:50.446
Base in Pennsylvania
this weekend.

38:50.450 --> 38:54.011
And they're having them all
around the country at bases

38:54.020 --> 38:55.749
that fly bombers
with nuclear weapons.

39:00.510 --> 39:02.558
A group from church is going.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.027
I want to go too.

39:04.030 --> 39:07.249
We'll be leaving tomorrow after
school, and it's chaperoned

39:07.250 --> 39:08.103
and--

39:08.110 --> 39:10.897
-OK.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.710
I think it's a worthwhile cause.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.938
And it sounds like a good idea.

39:19.840 --> 39:20.590
-Thank you.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.109
-We need to check on Kate.

39:35.120 --> 39:35.814
-Yeah.

39:40.860 --> 39:44.944
-So how long have you
been an FBI agent?

39:44.950 --> 39:45.746
-14 years.

39:52.330 --> 39:53.126
-Do you like it?

39:53.130 --> 39:54.495
-I do.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.740
Here you go.

39:55.750 --> 39:57.741
-Thank you.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.900
What do you like most about it?

39:59.910 --> 40:05.246
-Well, I feel like I'm doing
something good, worthwhile.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.133
-All right.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.677
What did you want
to be as a kid?

40:14.010 --> 40:14.704
-Rea|ly?

40:14.710 --> 40:16.519
-Yep.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.475
-How come?

40:17.480 --> 40:19.391
-I read their comic books.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.231
-The FBI has comic books?

40:21.240 --> 40:22.548
-Well, about them.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.563
You know, like
Aquaman or Spiderman,

40:24.570 --> 40:29.018
except these were about FBI
men chasing the bad guys,

40:29.020 --> 40:31.625
like John Dillinger.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.700
He was a notorious bank robber.

40:33.710 --> 40:35.439
The FBI nabbed him
in a big shootout

40:35.450 --> 40:37.862
outside a movie
theatre in Chicago.

40:37.870 --> 40:38.564
-Wow.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.050
-Yeah, stuff like that.

40:41.060 --> 40:42.982
-Is it fun?

40:42.990 --> 40:44.799
-Sometimes.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.279
-Well, what's it
like to be a here?

40:48.940 --> 40:50.168
-I'm not a hero, Henry.

43:12.870 --> 43:16.419
-Arkady knows I've been
providing you with information.

43:16.430 --> 43:18.170
-Oleg told him?

43:18.180 --> 43:18.874
-I can't go back.

43:22.170 --> 43:22.864
It's OK.

43:22.870 --> 43:23.996
It's gonna be OK.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.694
No, no.

43:24.700 --> 43:28.181
It won't be OK, Stan.

43:28.190 --> 43:30.124
I can never go back.

43:30.130 --> 43:31.028
They will sen me to Moscow!

43:31.030 --> 43:32.099
They will put me on a trial!

43:32.110 --> 43:32.804
I can't go back!

43:32.810 --> 43:33.777
-But you're safe here, Nina.

43:33.780 --> 43:36.157
I will not let
anything happen to you.

43:38.970 --> 43:40.483
-Where will I go?

43:40.490 --> 43:43.197
What will happen to me, Stan?

43:43.200 --> 43:48.513
-I will find a way out
for you and for me.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.533
Nothing will come
between us, Nina.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.336
Even

43:51.340 --> 43:52.034
Nothing.

44:10.530 --> 44:12.782
-I realised something today.

44:12.790 --> 44:15.213
-What?

44:15.220 --> 44:17.893
-Paige is like me.

44:17.900 --> 44:20.539
She wants to make a
difference in the world.

44:20.550 --> 44:22.609
She's just looking
in the wrong place.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.519
-What does it say?

44:36.510 --> 44:37.408
-Get Jared out.
