00:57.564 --> 00:59.363
Tell me more
about your gap year.

00:59.365 --> 01:01.099
It sounds so interesting.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.600
No, don't be silly.

01:02.602 --> 01:05.202
Come on, I can't believe
how many lives you've saved.

01:05.203 --> 01:08.439
No, I just did what I
think was right, you know?

01:08.441 --> 01:09.306
How's your mum?

01:09.308 --> 01:10.441
Oh, mummy.

01:10.443 --> 01:11.842
Yeah, she's fine.

01:11.844 --> 01:13.111
She got herself a dog.

01:13.113 --> 01:14.646
Keeps her entertained.

01:14.648 --> 01:16.815
She didn't really strike
me as much of dog person.

01:16.817 --> 01:18.917
Oh god no, she just wanted
something big and hairy

01:18.919 --> 01:21.318
to have a go at after dad died.

01:23.891 --> 01:26.459
I'm gonna get some more bubbly.

02:08.699 --> 02:09.533
Help me.

02:32.523 --> 02:33.858
Where are you?

04:15.555 --> 04:17.122
Okay, come on, Max.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.389
Just one leg in, okay?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.091
One, again.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.093
That's it.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.493
Okay, and the other one.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.831
That's it, okay?

04:26.301 --> 04:27.267
You all right?

04:27.269 --> 04:28.801
I don't like the water.

04:28.803 --> 04:30.102
I wanna get out.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.403
Max, please, come on.

04:32.405 --> 04:35.875
- It's just a bit of a bath.
- I don't like it, Tina.

04:35.877 --> 04:39.211
I said I don't need a bath
at this very moment of time.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.812
Max, please, you
need to have a bath.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.047
Come on, you stink.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.482
You can't go around
walking like that.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.884
Huh?

04:45.886 --> 04:47.552
Come on, it'll be quick, okay?

04:49.556 --> 04:52.190
Hey, Karen, what's up?

04:52.192 --> 04:55.827
No, I wasn't ever booked
in for work today.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.829
What, are you serious?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.198
Oh god, I am so sorry Karen.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.166
I had no idea.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.701
I don't suppose you can
get it covered at all?

05:04.703 --> 05:06.904
No, I understand, yeah.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.639
Sure, yeah, yeah.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.374
Sure, yeah, yeah,
I'll make it work.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.675
Don't worry about that, okay?

05:11.677 --> 05:13.510
Give me an hour, okay?

05:13.512 --> 05:14.578
See you soon.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.414
Bye.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.519
I don't want a bath
right this minute!

05:23.256 --> 05:24.222
Fine.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.856
Okay, you don't want a bath?

05:25.858 --> 05:26.723
You're not gonna get a bath.

05:26.725 --> 05:28.160
Come on, get out.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.598
Tina is mad at me.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.132
No, Max, okay.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.401
Tina's just really, really
stressed out right now, okay?

05:37.403 --> 05:39.869
Okay, come on, you
wanted out, so,

05:39.871 --> 05:41.472
get out then, okay?

06:09.534 --> 06:11.369
I can see you, Brenda.

06:16.307 --> 06:17.141
Oh.

06:19.377 --> 06:20.211
Hi, Tina.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.817
Oh my god, thank you for
coming on short notice.

06:28.819 --> 06:30.385
Sorry, I just, I messed up.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.519
I had no idea I
was at work today.

06:32.521 --> 06:34.621
So, um, yeah, just let
him watch movies all day

06:34.623 --> 06:36.858
and, yeah, I'll
be back by dinner.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.692
Okay, it's all right.

06:38.694 --> 06:40.161
Tina doesn't like me.

06:40.163 --> 06:41.396
Max, stop, okay?

06:41.398 --> 06:43.467
You know that's not true.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.734
Maxie, Tina does like you.

06:46.736 --> 06:49.806
She shouts at me,
and she hates me.

06:53.410 --> 06:56.111
Tina, can we just have a word?

06:56.113 --> 06:58.545
Yeah, it's, wait,
can we chat later?

06:58.547 --> 07:01.449
You know I can't
keep doing this, right?

07:01.451 --> 07:05.219
You know, coming here to take
care of him all the time.

07:05.221 --> 07:06.787
I mean, when I signed off,
you acted like you were

07:06.789 --> 07:08.222
gonna be your brother's
full time carer

07:08.224 --> 07:10.524
once I was relieved.

07:10.526 --> 07:12.393
And you've had to
fight tooth and nail

07:12.395 --> 07:13.961
to get full time
custody of your brother

07:13.963 --> 07:15.062
after your mother's passing.

07:15.064 --> 07:17.398
What are you saying?

07:17.400 --> 07:18.966
I just would be careful.

07:18.968 --> 07:19.801
Of what?

07:21.237 --> 07:24.904
All I'm saying is that
you are very young, okay?

07:24.906 --> 07:26.572
And you're taking on
a huge responsibility

07:26.574 --> 07:28.875
looking after him, okay?

07:28.877 --> 07:30.343
And I understand it, all right?

07:30.345 --> 07:34.548
You've got, you've got work,
bills, even more bills.

07:35.818 --> 07:38.751
You know, you just,
you need to decide

07:38.753 --> 07:40.686
what route to take.

07:40.688 --> 07:44.092
I'm sorry, what do
you mean what route?

07:45.627 --> 07:46.959
I think you should
let him be looked after

07:46.961 --> 07:48.363
by professionals.

07:50.131 --> 07:51.531
Just people who know
what they're doing,

07:51.533 --> 07:53.366
just until you can
get yourself sorted.

07:53.368 --> 07:55.700
You know, your feet
off the ground.

07:55.702 --> 07:58.538
Okay, like this situation,
I can tell it's not

07:58.540 --> 08:01.940
good for you, and it's
definitely not good for him.

08:01.942 --> 08:02.941
Okay, yeah.

08:02.943 --> 08:04.643
We'll talk about this later.

08:04.645 --> 08:05.478
Tina.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.945
Brenda.

08:06.947 --> 08:09.347
I appreciate you coming
today to help, I really do.

08:09.349 --> 08:11.185
But I won't ask again.

08:13.487 --> 08:14.654
See you later.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.332
And how
much is this one?

09:36.334 --> 09:37.900
Two pounds, 75.

09:37.902 --> 09:39.435
Are you serious?

09:39.437 --> 09:42.004
Well if you don't want
to pay that, then fuck off.

09:42.006 --> 09:42.840
God!

09:45.342 --> 09:46.643
But I didn't do anything.

09:46.645 --> 09:47.876
Tina.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.944
What time do you call this?

09:48.946 --> 09:50.012
You said an hour, tops.

09:50.014 --> 09:51.213
I know, I know, I know Karen.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.148
Look, I'm sorry, I
did the best I could.

09:53.150 --> 09:54.882
I shouldn't even
be here right now.

09:54.884 --> 09:56.518
I've got an appointment
with my sex therapist

09:56.520 --> 09:57.852
which I'm incredibly late for.

09:57.854 --> 10:00.055
I am never going to come.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.723
I completely understand,
look, I struggle with

10:01.725 --> 10:03.493
Luke sometimes, so.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.760
I canceled the
appointment, Tina.

10:04.762 --> 10:05.961
No, Karen, go.

10:05.963 --> 10:07.229
Honestly, look, it's worth it.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.130
Okay, look, I'm here right now.

10:08.132 --> 10:09.364
I can man the store.

10:09.366 --> 10:10.899
Look, I need to
talk to you anyway.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.732
Go on.

10:11.734 --> 10:12.968
The shop.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.937
We're not pulling
in enough sales.

10:14.939 --> 10:16.271
Well I wonder why that is.

10:16.273 --> 10:19.174
Why are you still here?

10:19.176 --> 10:21.108
Karen, what are you saying?

10:21.110 --> 10:24.111
I've had to resort to
selling things online.

10:24.113 --> 10:25.581
Book Face, List of Craig.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.048
I think you mean Craigslist.

10:27.050 --> 10:30.551
And that's not the store
that I set out to own.

10:30.553 --> 10:31.919
No, Karen, look I can help.

10:31.921 --> 10:33.787
We keep marketing it,
pushing the products,

10:33.789 --> 10:34.888
write advertisements.

10:34.890 --> 10:36.591
I can make YouTube videos.

10:36.593 --> 10:38.058
It's Tube You.

10:38.060 --> 10:39.293
Look, I don't think
there's any way of saving

10:39.295 --> 10:40.461
the shop, Tina.

10:40.463 --> 10:41.295
Not now.

10:41.297 --> 10:42.597
Karen, no.

10:42.599 --> 10:44.665
Oh, it's not as if we
didn't see this coming.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.534
We've spent way too
much money promoting it,

10:46.536 --> 10:50.238
and no one wants this stuff,
not in this day and age.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.907
Look, it absolutely
kills me to say it,

10:52.909 --> 10:54.342
but I've had to bite the bullet,

10:54.344 --> 10:55.775
and I'm calling it quits.

10:55.777 --> 10:58.613
Karen, please
don't, okay, look.

10:58.615 --> 11:00.814
Karen, is there
nothing that we can do?

11:00.816 --> 11:03.783
I can't lose my job, it
is all I've got left.

11:03.785 --> 11:06.152
It's not a decision I've
made lightly but it is

11:06.154 --> 11:08.321
a decision I have made.

11:08.323 --> 11:09.724
I can't undo it at this point.

11:09.726 --> 11:11.725
I've already had
interest selling it.

11:11.727 --> 11:13.093
Karen, please.

11:13.095 --> 11:15.128
I can't lose this.

11:15.130 --> 11:18.331
It's all I've got, too,
but I'm not even bringing

11:18.333 --> 11:19.798
enough to pay your wages.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.702
I'm literally paying out
to keep the store open,

11:22.704 --> 11:25.471
and come next week,
we'll be shut.

11:25.473 --> 11:28.173
I really do have to go
now and I'm very sorry

11:28.175 --> 11:31.176
you're the last to know,
but what I need of you today

11:31.178 --> 11:34.179
is to go into the back,
and inventory everything,

11:34.181 --> 11:35.448
make a list of everything.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.449
I've got to put it
all up for auction

11:36.451 --> 11:37.684
and make some money back.

11:37.686 --> 11:38.618
Okay.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.122
Look, I really do have to go.

11:42.391 --> 11:43.190
Oh.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.126
That's a really tight hug...

11:47.128 --> 11:49.461
I know, sweetie, I
know, I know, I know.

11:49.463 --> 11:52.533
Poor little thing,
poor little thing.

13:44.141 --> 13:47.342
Max, please talk to me.

13:47.344 --> 13:49.577
All right then.

13:49.579 --> 13:50.512
Get that down ya.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.013
Thank you for doing this.

13:52.015 --> 13:53.348
It's all right.

13:53.350 --> 13:55.417
What's a boyfriend for, eh?

13:55.419 --> 13:57.419
So remember this after
I've had a long day.

14:00.725 --> 14:01.690
Someone's hungry.

14:01.692 --> 14:04.894
Max, stop.

14:04.896 --> 14:06.995
Don't talk to me.

14:06.997 --> 14:10.098
Just finish, eat your
dinner properly, please.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.866
You're not my mom.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.934
Oh, I know that, okay?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.204
But I'm now in the place
of mom, so you gotta listen

14:16.206 --> 14:18.573
to me when I say for
you to eat your dinner.

14:18.575 --> 14:20.608
I don't have to
do what you say.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.113
Yes you goddamn do
when I pay the bills.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.583
Mom gave you this
house when she died.

14:29.585 --> 14:32.753
So you should not
pretend you paid for it,

14:32.755 --> 14:34.655
because you did not.

14:34.657 --> 14:35.823
No.

14:35.825 --> 14:37.256
You're right.

14:37.258 --> 14:38.594
You're so right.

14:40.061 --> 14:43.630
But you know what
mom did do, hm?

14:43.632 --> 14:46.065
She left us in a
shit load of debt

14:46.067 --> 14:51.004
and no Max, actually, she didn't
pay for this house at all.

14:51.006 --> 14:52.739
She still had a
mortgage out on it

14:52.741 --> 14:54.743
and today I lost my job.

14:55.945 --> 14:57.845
So you'd better get used
to the idea that living

14:57.847 --> 14:59.180
here won't last.

15:02.685 --> 15:04.016
I miss mom.

15:04.018 --> 15:06.686
Just finish your
goddamn dinner, Max.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.522
Please.

15:08.556 --> 15:09.390
Max.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.225
Just let him go away now.

15:12.227 --> 15:14.562
No, Luke, he needs to eat.

15:15.797 --> 15:18.698
Look, you shouldn't
talk to him like that.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.633
What do you mean
you lost your job?

15:20.635 --> 15:22.467
It's exactly how it sounds.

15:22.469 --> 15:25.670
So today I lost my job,
turns out nobody wants to buy

15:25.672 --> 15:27.272
antique crap anymore,
oh, and the business

15:27.274 --> 15:29.774
basically went piss out, yeah.

15:29.776 --> 15:31.676
What about, like, hipsters?

15:31.678 --> 15:33.545
No, they don't actually
buy anything though, okay?

15:33.547 --> 15:36.315
They just mope around the store.

15:36.317 --> 15:38.283
Just, I, I, I can't eat.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.117
Where are you going?

15:39.119 --> 15:39.952
I need a bath, okay?

15:39.954 --> 15:41.789
I've lost my appetite.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.243
Max?

16:42.882 --> 16:43.716
Oh, Maxie.

16:46.651 --> 16:48.219
I'm so sorry, okay?

16:50.322 --> 16:51.688
I'm sorry for the way I've been

16:51.690 --> 16:53.792
and how I've treated you.

16:54.659 --> 16:57.159
I don't want it this way, okay?

16:57.161 --> 17:01.332
It's just I have so much
on me right now, you know?

17:06.436 --> 17:07.803
Hey, look.

17:07.805 --> 17:09.137
Hey.

17:09.138 --> 17:10.473
I miss mom, too.

17:13.578 --> 17:15.914
God, I really miss her, Max.

17:17.515 --> 17:21.251
I just don't know if I
can do this on my own,

17:22.419 --> 17:25.287
but I can't let you go, no, Max.

17:25.289 --> 17:27.589
I love you, you're
my brother, okay?

17:27.590 --> 17:30.258
I can't not have you in my life.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.160
I promised mom I would
always look after you,

17:33.162 --> 17:35.131
no matter what happened.

17:38.068 --> 17:41.137
It's just, I, I just
get angry, okay?

17:44.307 --> 17:47.410
I get angry because
I'm mad at myself

17:49.312 --> 17:51.045
because I can't give you
what I promised I would

17:51.047 --> 17:54.784
when mom died, and I
have totally failed you.

17:57.654 --> 17:59.555
And I am so sorry, Max.

18:00.824 --> 18:03.959
And I wish I could bring
Mom back but I can't.

18:03.961 --> 18:07.563
I can't, and I really
want to, but I can't.

18:09.532 --> 18:14.537
I promise you, I'm gonna
make everything better, okay?

18:15.270 --> 18:16.439
It's all gonna change.

18:20.076 --> 18:20.910
Hey.

18:22.078 --> 18:25.311
And I thought I was
your second mommy, hm?

18:25.313 --> 18:27.482
Thought you were.

18:31.019 --> 18:32.087
Okay, well.

18:33.555 --> 18:35.955
Get some rest, it'll all be
different in the morning.

18:35.957 --> 18:37.025
It always is.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.330
Luke.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.734
What are you doing
with my work papers?

19:22.736 --> 19:23.835
You know she's
got this, right?

19:23.837 --> 19:25.104
Mhm.

19:25.106 --> 19:26.504
She's got
this in her stock.

19:26.506 --> 19:28.107
Yeah.

19:28.109 --> 19:29.040
Yeah?

19:29.042 --> 19:30.975
That's worth like 800 grand.

19:30.977 --> 19:32.910
Jesus, I knew it'd
be worth a bit, but,

19:32.912 --> 19:35.415
well, Karen's gonna be sorted.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.951
- Do you think that...
- What?

19:38.953 --> 19:40.052
Nothing, oh, it's stupid.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.487
What, Luke, come on.

19:42.489 --> 19:45.057
Babe, that's worth
like three houses.

19:45.059 --> 19:45.892
Yeah.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.660
I'm just saying, it would
solve a lot of problems.

19:49.662 --> 19:51.929
Like, what are you saying?

19:51.931 --> 19:53.933
I think you know what.

19:55.467 --> 19:56.901
Wait, no, no, no, no.

19:56.903 --> 20:00.637
If I steal that, I could
go to jail for years.

20:00.639 --> 20:02.073
No.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.306
No, I'm not saying
that you should steal it.

20:03.308 --> 20:03.975
I'm not saying that
I should steal it.

20:03.977 --> 20:05.176
I'm just saying.

20:05.178 --> 20:07.310
No, get to the goddamn point.

20:07.312 --> 20:10.213
I'm just saying
that I know a guy,

20:10.215 --> 20:11.715
who knows a guy,

20:11.717 --> 20:13.784
who knows another guy.

20:17.856 --> 20:18.690
Well.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.499
Hey.

20:29.501 --> 20:30.934
He says he'll do it.

20:30.936 --> 20:32.536
For 50%.

20:32.538 --> 20:33.369
Right.

20:33.371 --> 20:35.172
Wait, who is this guy?

20:35.174 --> 20:37.540
He's just a guy into
this sort of thing.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.675
You know, stealing
and selling it on.

20:39.677 --> 20:41.577
Are you talking about
your drummer Duncan?

20:41.579 --> 20:43.781
Eh, yeah, drummer Duncan.

20:44.982 --> 20:45.815
Look, Tina, he says
he's got a client

20:45.817 --> 20:47.049
for this sort of thing.

20:47.051 --> 20:48.651
If we can just get ahold of her.

20:48.653 --> 20:50.119
So how do we get it?

20:50.121 --> 20:50.953
You've just got to
leave the back door open,

20:50.955 --> 20:52.320
that's what he said.

20:52.322 --> 20:53.356
Okay, look.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.992
What if they take it, take
off, and we don't get a penny?

20:56.994 --> 20:58.260
What if I get caught, Luke?

20:58.262 --> 21:00.328
You've got nothing
to be caught for.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.830
They're doing all the work.

21:01.832 --> 21:03.665
All you've got to do is
leave that back door open.

21:03.667 --> 21:04.899
This'll change your life, Tina.

21:04.901 --> 21:08.371
Make it so much easier
if you just say yes.

21:23.287 --> 21:25.187
All right, all right.

21:25.189 --> 21:27.156
You ready?

21:27.158 --> 21:28.389
Of course I am.

21:28.391 --> 21:31.061
I was born ready, let's go baby!

21:44.506 --> 21:47.374
What if they take the amulet
and sell it for themselves?

21:47.376 --> 21:48.343
I've know Duncan for years.

21:48.345 --> 21:50.510
He wouldn't do that to me.

21:50.512 --> 21:52.079
Look, relax, Tina.

21:52.081 --> 21:53.580
It's gonna be fine.

21:53.582 --> 21:55.916
Remember Paris, eh?

22:01.523 --> 22:03.525
Luke, it's just, look.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.426
What I'm worried about is...

22:06.428 --> 22:09.263
It's gonna be fine, nothing
bad is gonna happen, Tina.

22:09.265 --> 22:10.297
Do you trust me?

22:10.299 --> 22:12.266
Right, this is it.

22:12.268 --> 22:13.800
All you've got to do
is go and open the door

22:13.802 --> 22:15.534
and then that's it, you're out.

22:15.536 --> 22:17.436
We'll wait for the call, I'll
meet you at the safe house

22:17.438 --> 22:19.273
and then that's it.

22:19.275 --> 22:21.241
Your life, our lives.

22:21.243 --> 22:22.242
They change forever.

22:22.244 --> 22:25.245
Yeah.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.950
Lukey, long time
no see, brother.

22:30.952 --> 22:32.985
I saw you at band
practice last week, Dunc.

22:32.987 --> 22:33.986
Oh yeah.

22:33.988 --> 22:35.087
Luke, this is Ali.

22:35.089 --> 22:36.188
Hi.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.656
She's the look out.

22:37.658 --> 22:39.058
And that silly cow blinding
everyone with the lights

22:39.060 --> 22:40.092
is Jas.

22:40.094 --> 22:42.328
And I, I'm the main man.

22:42.330 --> 22:44.063
Should we get goin', eh?

22:44.065 --> 22:45.597
Anyone could turn
up at any minute.

22:45.599 --> 22:48.067
Oh, she a keeper isn't she?

22:48.069 --> 22:50.269
Luke, come on, man, let's
get the doors unlocked.

22:50.271 --> 22:51.906
Aye, you got Tina.

23:01.682 --> 23:04.918
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.295
Holy shit.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.631
Nice.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.437
Oh my god.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.805
Oi, we're taking this.

24:02.807 --> 24:04.241
Tell Jas to bring the
truck 'round, yeah,

24:04.243 --> 24:06.077
and drop the tailgate.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.327
Hey.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.594
It's done.

24:24.596 --> 24:25.830
They've got it.

24:28.566 --> 24:31.236
It's all gonna get better now.

24:51.255 --> 24:53.488
It was just like that when
I got here this morning.

24:53.490 --> 24:57.392
So you have no idea
what time this took place?

24:57.394 --> 24:58.527
No, I don't have a clue.

24:58.529 --> 25:00.561
That's what the security
footage was for.

25:00.563 --> 25:03.198
Karen, what's happened?

25:03.200 --> 25:04.266
Oh, I don't know.

25:04.268 --> 25:06.100
I don't, I don't know.

25:06.102 --> 25:08.903
I must've left the
back door open when I

25:08.905 --> 25:10.371
shut up shop last night.

25:10.373 --> 25:14.443
Someone, someone broke
in and they stole the box

25:14.445 --> 25:16.777
from the back room.

25:16.779 --> 25:19.081
The security
footage, everything.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.348
Everything.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.250
Well, whoever it was,
they certainly knew the

25:22.252 --> 25:23.984
layout of the store.

25:23.986 --> 25:25.586
Why do you say that?

25:25.588 --> 25:27.188
Well, 'cause they
knew where the security

25:27.190 --> 25:28.956
cameras were.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.691
They took them.

25:30.693 --> 25:33.294
They covered their tracks.

25:33.296 --> 25:36.629
I understand you're
about to go bankrupt.

25:36.631 --> 25:38.365
You think I stole this.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.367
You think I would
do such a thing?

25:40.369 --> 25:43.337
Hang on, I'm not some
kind of fraud or sneak.

25:43.339 --> 25:45.872
I don't walk around
wearing a fucking trilby.

25:45.874 --> 25:48.775
Hm, I've heard
crazier stories.

25:48.777 --> 25:50.210
Crazier still when
you consider those

25:50.212 --> 25:52.412
who wear trilbys.

25:52.414 --> 25:57.117
Stories like these, like
trying to recoup costs.

25:57.119 --> 25:58.618
Do not make light of this.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.554
This is a very
dangerous situation.

26:00.556 --> 26:02.856
Look, it's not about the money.

26:02.858 --> 26:05.758
I don't give a rat's
ass about the money.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.931
Whoever took this is in
serious danger, detective.

26:16.938 --> 26:19.771
Whoever took this is in
serious danger, detective.

26:19.773 --> 26:21.474
Serious danger, detective.

26:21.476 --> 26:24.410
Serious danger, detective.

26:47.801 --> 26:49.334
Look mate, would you relax?

26:49.336 --> 26:51.203
She's gonna be here in
a bit, have a drink.

26:51.205 --> 26:53.338
Come on, man, I'm looking
after her brother, aren't I?

26:53.340 --> 26:54.540
Oh is that who he is?

26:54.542 --> 26:55.806
Yes, Tina's little brother.

26:55.808 --> 26:57.176
He's asleep upstairs,
so let's keep it down

26:57.178 --> 26:58.544
or turn that off or something.

26:58.546 --> 27:00.112
I don't want him getting
involved, you know.

27:00.114 --> 27:01.712
What's all this,
gamey soldiers?

27:01.714 --> 27:03.948
Luke, you're having
a drink, mate.

27:03.950 --> 27:04.882
Now.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.652
Cheers to being bloody men!

27:06.654 --> 27:08.286
Let's go, men, ah!

27:08.288 --> 27:09.720
Let's get pissed.

27:09.722 --> 27:11.291
Let's go men, ah!

27:52.998 --> 27:54.233
Oh, mum's here.

27:55.267 --> 27:57.067
How was it, how was work?

27:57.069 --> 27:58.767
Yeah, all right.

27:58.769 --> 28:00.869
Well, she doesn't suspect me.

28:00.871 --> 28:02.572
Should they really be
drinking that much?

28:02.574 --> 28:05.074
It won't bother
them, it's fine.

28:05.076 --> 28:06.543
Seriously Tina, this is it.

28:06.545 --> 28:10.779
They've done it, this is the
start of the rest of your life.

28:10.781 --> 28:12.081
Where is it?

28:12.083 --> 28:13.616
You wanna see it?

28:13.618 --> 28:14.450
Yeah.

28:14.452 --> 28:15.686
Come with me.

28:19.724 --> 28:20.725
Yes, mate!

28:26.998 --> 28:28.764
Luke, what the hell?

28:28.766 --> 28:29.699
What?

28:29.701 --> 28:31.567
They stole the entire tomb?

28:31.569 --> 28:33.669
They were meant to just
take the goddamn amulet.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.870
Well I don't know, maybe
they got carried away.

28:35.872 --> 28:38.340
They can probably sell
what's in the box, eh?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.743
No, it's just, Karen,

28:40.745 --> 28:43.077
she said something dangerous
could happen with it.

28:43.079 --> 28:44.312
Like what?

28:44.314 --> 28:46.347
I don't know, okay,
it's just today,

28:46.349 --> 28:48.249
she looked really freaked
out and it wasn't over

28:48.251 --> 28:49.752
the cash she lost, Luke.

28:49.754 --> 28:51.753
It was over this thing.

28:51.755 --> 28:53.354
It's just a box, Tina.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.591
It's not like that film with
your man Brendan Fraser.

28:56.593 --> 28:58.726
What's the worst
that could happen?

28:58.728 --> 29:00.395
Has anyone opened it yet?

29:00.397 --> 29:01.230
Nope.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.869
We were waiting for you.

29:11.074 --> 29:13.241
So you're saying some
weird shit could come out

29:13.243 --> 29:14.509
and poison us, yeah?

29:14.511 --> 29:15.743
No, she doesn't
know that for sure.

29:15.745 --> 29:18.011
What did your
boss say, exactly?

29:18.013 --> 29:19.280
Well.

29:19.282 --> 29:21.549
She said that it was
extremely dangerous

29:21.551 --> 29:23.618
and that she was really
worried about whoever had it.

29:24.788 --> 29:26.186
Oh come on, just
open it, it'll be fine.

29:26.188 --> 29:27.122
Go on, Jas.

29:43.672 --> 29:44.604
Oh, it stinks.

29:44.606 --> 29:45.806
Should we be breathin' that in?

29:45.808 --> 29:47.606
Aye, I've smelt
worse coming from you.

29:47.608 --> 29:48.874
Dickhead.

29:48.876 --> 29:50.109
Kind of wanna peel the
wrap off and see what

29:50.111 --> 29:51.243
it looks like underneath.

29:51.245 --> 29:54.180
Oh you're sick, you know that?

29:54.182 --> 29:55.516
We just could.

30:00.789 --> 30:02.389
Yeah, it looks better
on the mummy, Jas.

30:02.391 --> 30:04.225
Oh fuck off, Duncan.

30:06.394 --> 30:08.260
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

30:08.262 --> 30:10.896
What's a boy or a girl?

30:10.898 --> 30:12.365
Max.

30:12.367 --> 30:13.232
No.

30:13.234 --> 30:14.736
Come on, let's go.

30:21.174 --> 30:22.340
Okay.

30:22.342 --> 30:23.676
Max.

30:23.678 --> 30:26.578
Max, come on listen
to me please, come on.

30:26.580 --> 30:30.016
Okay, so, I am letting
you use my laptop,

30:30.884 --> 30:33.220
so you can't break it, okay?

30:34.121 --> 30:35.653
All right, so just so you know,

30:35.655 --> 30:37.655
I have disabled purchase buying,

30:37.657 --> 30:40.124
especially after you
bought that chocolate.

30:40.126 --> 30:42.893
I never purchased
that chocolate.

30:42.895 --> 30:45.062
Okay, well, Maxie,
if you need anything,

30:45.064 --> 30:46.464
I'll be outside.

30:46.466 --> 30:47.267
Okay?

30:49.002 --> 30:50.904
Don't do anything else.

30:56.410 --> 30:58.743
Look, Tina, Tina.

30:58.745 --> 31:00.177
You okay?

31:00.179 --> 31:01.515
How could you?

31:02.948 --> 31:06.316
The one thing I asked you,
no, wait, I specifically

31:06.318 --> 31:09.388
asked you not to
bring him, didn't I?

31:10.823 --> 31:12.689
My god, I asked you, look,
I said not to bring him.

31:12.691 --> 31:14.057
I didn't want him
involved in any of it.

31:14.059 --> 31:15.459
Look.

31:15.461 --> 31:16.959
I'm sorry, okay, I
thought Brenda would take

31:16.961 --> 31:19.195
care of him for the weekend
but she said she couldn't.

31:19.197 --> 31:20.029
What do you mean she couldn't?

31:20.031 --> 31:21.532
She always helps out.

31:21.534 --> 31:24.400
She said you hadn't paid
her for the last few times.

31:24.402 --> 31:26.837
She's not coming
'round any more.

31:26.839 --> 31:27.672
Oh.

31:30.975 --> 31:35.044
She said she thought I
should put Max in a home.

31:35.046 --> 31:38.047
I need you to answer me
honestly on this, okay?

31:38.049 --> 31:38.882
Sure.

31:38.884 --> 31:40.451
Now don't lie to me.

31:40.453 --> 31:42.753
Just tell me straight.

31:42.755 --> 31:46.224
Do you think I'm unable
to look after Max?

31:47.225 --> 31:48.658
Wow.

31:48.660 --> 31:49.461
Really?

31:50.662 --> 31:52.261
You think it, too, you
think I'm unsuitable

31:52.263 --> 31:53.429
to look after him?

31:53.431 --> 31:54.697
Don't come to
conclusions, all right?

31:54.699 --> 31:55.665
I just think it
was a lot for you

31:55.667 --> 31:57.032
to take on after your mum died.

31:57.034 --> 31:59.002
Don't follow me, okay?

32:00.304 --> 32:01.136
Christ.

32:01.138 --> 32:01.972
Tina!

32:03.207 --> 32:04.439
- Tina!
- Leave me alone.

32:04.441 --> 32:05.373
No, Tina!

32:05.375 --> 32:06.843
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke.

32:06.845 --> 32:08.009
Let me chat to her, yeah?

32:08.011 --> 32:09.544
You just go in there, calm down,

32:09.546 --> 32:12.714
get yourself a beer, and leave
it to old Dunkers here, yeah?

32:12.716 --> 32:14.485
I'm great with women.

32:22.627 --> 32:24.192
You know he means
best for you, right?

32:24.194 --> 32:25.028
Sure.

32:26.965 --> 32:29.564
Look, I don't know what you
two are fighting about, but,

32:29.566 --> 32:30.899
whatever it is, I'm
just telling you now,

32:30.901 --> 32:32.100
he aint about to do
this sort of shit

32:32.102 --> 32:33.702
for just anyone, do you hear?

32:33.704 --> 32:36.371
This is some proper risky
shit he's up to here.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.239
Yeah, I know, I'm just
finding it all really difficult

32:38.241 --> 32:39.273
in the moment.

32:39.275 --> 32:40.109
Hm.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.730
So you do this full time?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.165
I wouldn't say it's
nine to five, no, but,

33:06.167 --> 33:07.667
I make a living doing
shit like this, yeah.

33:07.669 --> 33:08.835
I'm guessing this
is the biggest job

33:08.837 --> 33:09.736
you've done so far.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.140
Could be, yeah.

33:12.141 --> 33:14.408
Usually it's smaller stuff.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.175
Got a pretty meaty
grab on this one.

33:16.177 --> 33:17.143
Oh, who's the buyer?

33:17.145 --> 33:18.379
Don't know.

33:18.381 --> 33:19.713
I usually just hand the
stuff over to the guys

33:19.715 --> 33:21.214
who sells stuff to the buyer.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.817
The buyer don't wanna get
his hand dirty, you see.

33:23.819 --> 33:25.953
Right, and you trust him?

33:25.955 --> 33:27.587
I do, yeah.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.289
Is it me, or
can you hear that?

33:30.892 --> 33:32.358
Yeah, what?

33:32.360 --> 33:34.460
It sounds like a party's
going on or something.

33:34.462 --> 33:35.662
Leave 'em to it.

33:35.664 --> 33:39.331
We leave them alone,
they'll leave us alone.

33:39.333 --> 33:40.833
I mean, I'm sure we
can take our business

33:40.835 --> 33:43.404
somewhere more quiet, personal.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.072
How do you feel about that?

34:15.069 --> 34:15.902
No.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.469
No, no, no, no.

34:31.117 --> 34:34.051
Okay, asshole, let's
get this straight.

34:34.053 --> 34:37.388
I'm only here for one thing
and it sure as hell aint that,

34:37.389 --> 34:40.024
so get your shitty
little hands off me

34:40.025 --> 34:43.995
and don't you dare treat
me like one of your hoes.

34:43.996 --> 34:44.929
My hands aren't
shit, actually.

34:44.931 --> 34:45.998
I'm an excellent drummer.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.931
Fuck off asshole.

34:46.934 --> 34:47.732
- Duncan...
- Hey.

34:47.734 --> 34:49.702
Put your dog on a leash.

34:55.139 --> 34:56.373
Is it really weird
that I wanna screw you

34:56.376 --> 34:58.274
in front of the mummy?

34:58.276 --> 35:01.714
Oh well you naughty
minx, come on, then.

35:37.683 --> 35:39.181
Max, it's me, come on.

35:39.183 --> 35:40.784
Open up, please.

35:40.786 --> 35:42.418
I wanna be alone.

35:42.420 --> 35:43.787
Go away.

35:45.589 --> 35:48.857
Come on, Maxie, you can't
be angry at me forever.

35:48.859 --> 35:49.958
Hm?

35:49.960 --> 35:51.028
Yes, I can.

35:53.097 --> 35:54.496
Okay, well.

35:54.498 --> 35:55.597
When you're ready to
speak to me again,

35:55.599 --> 35:57.668
I'll be downstairs, okay?

36:00.537 --> 36:02.372
Ah, whoa, on my bed?

36:04.641 --> 36:08.145
Get in there!

36:12.582 --> 36:13.848
This is so bloody
weird, you know that?

36:13.850 --> 36:17.085
What's fun about being normal?

36:47.950 --> 36:50.619
So, already drinking then, hm?

36:51.587 --> 36:52.755
Not anymore.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.291
Guns.

36:59.293 --> 37:00.626
Nice.

37:00.628 --> 37:02.129
Of course they would bring guns.

37:02.131 --> 37:03.829
Of course you would bring
my brother to a place

37:03.831 --> 37:05.297
full of guns.

37:05.299 --> 37:07.134
Look, Tina, can we just
stop this, all right?

37:07.136 --> 37:08.367
I'm not trying to
make things worse.

37:08.369 --> 37:09.635
I'm not trying to
upset you, you know.

37:09.637 --> 37:12.139
I know, I know, okay, look.

37:12.141 --> 37:13.707
I'm sorry, okay?

37:13.709 --> 37:16.610
It's just, look, I
took it personal.

37:16.612 --> 37:19.746
It's just, the truth is, well,

37:19.748 --> 37:22.314
the truth is, I know I'm
doing a really crappy job

37:22.316 --> 37:25.051
right now and, I just get angry.

37:25.053 --> 37:26.619
I just want change, Luke.

37:26.621 --> 37:28.020
I know you do.

37:28.022 --> 37:30.022
And that's why we're
doing this, remember.

37:30.024 --> 37:32.527
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

37:36.496 --> 37:38.063
All right.

37:38.065 --> 37:39.531
How's Max?

37:39.533 --> 37:41.033
Yeah, he's fine, he was
playing with his dinosaur, so.

37:41.035 --> 37:43.269
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

37:49.309 --> 37:52.979
I wanna look at the
mummy while you do me.

37:54.181 --> 37:55.079
What the hell?

37:55.081 --> 37:56.047
What, you can't look?

37:56.049 --> 37:56.950
No, look.

38:01.856 --> 38:02.787
Yeah.

38:02.789 --> 38:04.589
What the hell?

38:04.591 --> 38:06.225
Max.

38:06.227 --> 38:07.725
Max?

38:07.727 --> 38:09.195
What is it?

38:09.197 --> 38:10.962
Something's seem to have
gone flippin' wonkers.

38:10.964 --> 38:12.397
What's going on?

38:12.399 --> 38:13.631
The mummy is missing
and so is the amulet.

38:13.633 --> 38:14.465
How can it just be missin'?

38:14.467 --> 38:15.700
Who saw it last?

38:15.702 --> 38:16.968
Well we were in
here messing about.

38:16.970 --> 38:18.468
One minute it was here,
and the next it's gone.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.071
Someone come into this
room and flippin' took it.

38:20.073 --> 38:21.738
Who would take the mummy?

38:21.740 --> 38:23.274
Well unless it's got
up and gone for a walk

38:23.276 --> 38:25.676
on its own, how else
do you explain it?

38:25.678 --> 38:27.680
Oh, I know who's got it.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.016
Move!

38:33.018 --> 38:34.084
What the hell, Duncan?

38:34.086 --> 38:35.519
Max, Max!

38:35.521 --> 38:37.020
Open this door!

38:37.022 --> 38:38.421
Shut up, shut up!

38:38.423 --> 38:39.790
Shut up, shut up!

38:39.792 --> 38:41.091
Calm down, Duncan.

38:41.093 --> 38:43.293
Calm down, okay,
I'll talk to him.

38:43.295 --> 38:45.361
Just calm down.

38:45.363 --> 38:47.631
Max, baby, it's me, okay?

38:47.633 --> 38:49.466
Open the door for me, please.

38:49.468 --> 38:51.201
I'm not gonna let him
hurt you, I promise.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.537
Just open the door, Max, please.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.072
For me?

38:55.074 --> 38:57.074
Max, come on mate, open
the door for her, please.

38:57.076 --> 38:58.541
I didn't meant to scare ya.

38:58.543 --> 38:59.375
I just want a little chat.

38:59.377 --> 39:00.811
Max, come here.

39:00.813 --> 39:02.346
Oh look, there he is, yeah?

39:02.348 --> 39:03.913
I'm really sorry about
what I shouted, mate.

39:03.915 --> 39:05.182
I didn't mean to scare ya.

39:05.184 --> 39:07.850
Basically, yeah, um,
I just wanna know

39:07.852 --> 39:09.385
where's the mummy, yeah?

39:09.387 --> 39:10.620
And where's the amulet?

39:10.622 --> 39:11.454
What have you done with it?

39:11.456 --> 39:12.722
No, Duncan!

39:12.724 --> 39:15.224
If you even touch him, I
will cut your balls off.

39:15.226 --> 39:17.228
Max, baby, are you okay?

39:18.796 --> 39:19.996
You good?

39:19.998 --> 39:23.431
Where's the mummy
and the amulet?

39:23.433 --> 39:25.134
I don't know
where the amulet is.

39:25.136 --> 39:27.736
He's trying me, Luke,
he's really trying.

39:27.738 --> 39:29.338
I saw the mummy.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.306
Where did you
see the mummy Max?

39:31.308 --> 39:32.240
Tell me.

39:32.242 --> 39:33.508
It was walking outside.

39:33.510 --> 39:34.677
There you go, you got
what you wanted, now go.

39:34.679 --> 39:35.678
Walking outside?

39:35.680 --> 39:36.679
Outside the house.

39:36.681 --> 39:38.680
Everybody just
stay calm, okay?

39:38.682 --> 39:40.448
I'll go out and get it.

39:40.450 --> 39:42.184
If the amulet was on the mummy,

39:42.186 --> 39:44.619
then it still would
be on it now, aye?

39:44.621 --> 39:46.255
Go on then.

39:46.257 --> 39:47.658
Good?

39:48.525 --> 39:50.959
You've gotta take it down.

39:50.961 --> 39:51.795
Oi.

39:52.696 --> 39:55.063
It better be out there.

40:00.636 --> 40:01.470
Got ya.

40:11.514 --> 40:14.684
Now, where did that
amulet go to, hm?

40:15.952 --> 40:17.952
You naughty boy.

40:17.954 --> 40:19.286
Hm?

40:19.288 --> 40:23.960
You naughty boy.

40:27.596 --> 40:32.201
Having fun, hm?

40:40.775 --> 40:41.576
Great.

41:25.253 --> 41:29.087
♪ Naughty motherfucker

41:29.089 --> 41:30.322
Is that the buyer?

41:30.324 --> 41:31.158
Shut up.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.328
I've got this.

41:36.063 --> 41:38.130
Hello, Duncan speaking.

41:38.132 --> 41:40.300
Martin, how was the drive?

41:43.569 --> 41:44.835
Max?

41:44.837 --> 41:45.736
Come on.

41:45.738 --> 41:47.638
Max, look at me.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.572
Look at me.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.141
Max, Max.

41:50.143 --> 41:52.843
Okay, don't lie to me, okay?

41:52.845 --> 41:53.811
No.

41:53.813 --> 41:55.179
I'm not gonna be mad at you.

41:55.181 --> 41:55.982
Promise.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.950
Do you have the mummy?

41:58.952 --> 42:01.053
I don't have the mummy.

42:01.055 --> 42:03.888
It would be too big
for me to carry.

42:03.890 --> 42:05.589
I'm not gonna be mad, okay?

42:05.591 --> 42:09.226
Just, tell me where it is,
and we'll get this sorted out.

42:09.228 --> 42:11.729
You never listen to me.

42:11.731 --> 42:13.466
You never talk to me.

42:14.934 --> 42:18.302
Oh, Max.

42:18.304 --> 42:19.472
Yep yep yep.

42:23.376 --> 42:24.210
He's here.

42:25.211 --> 42:26.176
He's outside.

42:26.178 --> 42:27.110
Do you want me to come?

42:27.112 --> 42:28.578
No, I want you to find Jas.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.046
I need you to find the
mummy and the amulet.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.247
We need to get this shit moving.

42:31.249 --> 42:34.551
Go on chop, chop.

42:34.553 --> 42:35.617
Eh, you've got a
meeting, don't you?

42:35.619 --> 42:37.854
No, Luke, stay here.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.155
Yeah, find out if
that kid's got it,

42:39.157 --> 42:40.290
if he's hidden it somewhere.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.092
Can you do that for me, mate?

42:42.094 --> 42:43.428
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

43:15.793 --> 43:16.724
Martin?

43:16.726 --> 43:19.128
Good to meet you, mate.

43:22.031 --> 43:22.866
Sweet.

43:25.302 --> 43:26.136
Jas?

43:27.070 --> 43:27.904
Jasmine?

43:36.514 --> 43:40.082
Jas, what the fuck
are you wearin'?

43:40.084 --> 43:43.651
Jasmine?

44:37.072 --> 44:38.171
So he doesn't have it?

44:38.173 --> 44:39.705
Apparently not.

44:39.707 --> 44:40.940
But I mean, come on,
how in the hell would he

44:40.942 --> 44:42.942
carry that thing on his own?

44:42.944 --> 44:44.109
What are you thinkin'?

44:44.111 --> 44:45.844
I'm thinking Duncan
is spinning us.

44:45.846 --> 44:47.112
You think he stole it?

44:47.114 --> 44:48.548
Yeah, and I think
they're selling it.

44:48.550 --> 44:50.783
Come on, he lost it,
don't you know the answer?

44:50.785 --> 44:51.717
Nah, he wouldn't
do that to me.

44:51.719 --> 44:53.419
What makes you so sure?

44:53.421 --> 44:54.687
Huh?

44:54.689 --> 44:56.155
Well he's outside
now with the buyer.

44:56.157 --> 44:58.424
I've shown you mine,
so now you show me yours.

44:58.426 --> 45:00.693
Well at the minute, she's
getting a polish up, you know?

45:00.695 --> 45:01.826
A sort out.

45:01.828 --> 45:03.596
Be with you in a bit.

45:03.598 --> 45:05.063
You don't have it, do you?

45:05.065 --> 45:06.764
Mate, I do.

45:06.766 --> 45:08.866
It's just, uh, as I said,
it's getting a sort out.

45:08.868 --> 45:11.170
Look, why don't we go
down to the pub, yeah?

45:11.172 --> 45:13.738
And we'll have a drink.

45:13.740 --> 45:15.476
Where's the amulet?

45:23.684 --> 45:27.051
Jas, what the fuck
are you wearin'?

45:30.357 --> 45:32.692
Duncan, what's this about?

45:33.827 --> 45:36.294
Does this work on anyone?

45:36.296 --> 45:38.529
You do realize I'm gay?

45:38.531 --> 45:39.366
Oh.

45:40.866 --> 45:44.067
Ali, what in the
fuck are you wearin'?

45:44.069 --> 45:45.603
Come on girls, it's all
gettin' a bit embarrassing

45:45.605 --> 45:46.673
now isn't it?

45:49.942 --> 45:53.243
Could we possibly have a little
bit less of the theatrics?

45:53.245 --> 45:56.179
In fact, if you don't have
the amulet, I'm going.

45:56.181 --> 45:58.951
And I'm taking
the money with me.

46:00.919 --> 46:04.254
Now I've told you,
this won't work.

46:04.256 --> 46:05.924
I don't like flange.

46:08.193 --> 46:11.461
Now if you've got some
sort of naked Egyptian hunk

46:11.463 --> 46:12.829
in there, then bring him out.

46:12.831 --> 46:15.165
Let's go, all right, yeah?

46:15.167 --> 46:16.402
But, otherwise,

46:18.337 --> 46:19.469
show me the amulet.

46:34.786 --> 46:36.519
Oh, as if.

46:38.222 --> 46:39.255
Max!

46:39.257 --> 46:40.256
Max!

46:40.258 --> 46:42.491
Max, please open the door.

46:42.493 --> 46:44.225
Please open the door, please.

46:44.227 --> 46:45.062
Max!

46:46.197 --> 46:47.296
Max!

46:47.298 --> 46:48.230
Max!

46:48.232 --> 46:49.932
Max, please open the door.

46:49.934 --> 46:52.034
Max, let me in you little shit.

46:52.036 --> 46:54.503
Open the door you little shit!

46:54.505 --> 46:55.440
- Max!
- Max!

46:57.075 --> 46:59.040
Open the door!

47:02.714 --> 47:04.245
Go, shoo!

47:04.247 --> 47:06.081
Max, the door, open it.

47:06.083 --> 47:07.215
Max?

47:07.217 --> 47:08.083
Shoo!

47:08.085 --> 47:09.451
Go on!

47:14.191 --> 47:15.192
Oh fuck off.

47:32.441 --> 47:35.577
- Was that a mummy?
- Uh huh.

47:35.579 --> 47:36.580
Oh my god.

47:55.364 --> 47:56.830
Oh my god, Luke.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.065
Karen, she was scared
about us opening the tomb.

47:59.067 --> 48:00.434
What have we done?

48:00.436 --> 48:01.869
It's not a mummy
though, is it?

48:01.871 --> 48:03.670
The mummy's real!

48:03.672 --> 48:04.872
But maybe he's friendly.

48:04.874 --> 48:08.842
Why am I the only
one talking sense here?

48:08.844 --> 48:13.346
Get to grips with the fact
that the mummy is alive.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.314
What do we do?

48:15.316 --> 48:18.116
I have to tell her,
Luke, she has to know.

48:18.118 --> 48:19.819
You can't tell her,
Tina, you'll lose the cash.

48:19.821 --> 48:21.019
You cannot lose the money.

48:21.021 --> 48:22.922
Luke, it's a bit
goddamn late for that.

48:22.924 --> 48:24.591
Duncan the dick just ran off
with the money in the woods,

48:24.593 --> 48:26.762
so what do we do now, huh?

49:14.808 --> 49:15.642
Fuck!

49:27.955 --> 49:31.222
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!

49:37.263 --> 49:40.898
♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star

49:40.900 --> 49:45.101
♪ How I wonder what you are

49:45.103 --> 49:48.373
Fuck you!

49:52.344 --> 49:53.178
Got ya.

49:54.246 --> 49:55.077
Knock, knock.

49:55.079 --> 49:56.078
Knock, knock.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.848
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

49:57.850 --> 49:59.517
Stone.

49:59.519 --> 50:00.520
Stone who?

50:02.655 --> 50:03.488
Stoner.

50:04.957 --> 50:06.222
Stoner.

50:06.224 --> 50:09.392
Do you get it, 'cause
your Kylie's a stoner.

50:10.328 --> 50:12.564
When did it start snowing?

50:15.667 --> 50:20.472
I've never been so
split up.

50:21.673 --> 50:22.772
Get it?

50:22.774 --> 50:23.773
Splits?

50:27.511 --> 50:32.516
For some reason, you look
extremely sexy right now.

50:36.152 --> 50:40.290
Am I really stoned, or
there's money on the floor?

50:41.759 --> 50:45.028
You can make it rain any day
of the week, Kylie.

50:45.030 --> 50:47.765
Legit though,
keeper's finders!

50:55.406 --> 50:57.041
Come on, hurry up.

50:59.175 --> 51:00.776
Like seriously?

51:00.778 --> 51:03.477
Normally it's like
hard as a rock.

51:03.479 --> 51:06.982
I think it's like, I banged
one out this morning.

51:06.984 --> 51:08.649
What are you chatting?

51:08.651 --> 51:10.219
Just give it to me.

51:13.156 --> 51:15.892
I'm just trying
to wake him up.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.325
Oh.

51:18.327 --> 51:19.660
The more the merrier.

51:19.662 --> 51:20.494
Who's your mate?

51:20.496 --> 51:21.862
Maybe he can go first?

51:21.864 --> 51:22.964
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

51:22.966 --> 51:24.297
Don't take it off.

51:24.299 --> 51:25.565
I've always wanted
to do it with someone

51:25.567 --> 51:27.801
that I couldn't see the face of.

51:27.803 --> 51:30.337
What are you
actually talking about?

51:31.306 --> 51:33.341
Who's your mummy?

51:33.343 --> 51:35.141
What the fuck?

52:03.304 --> 52:04.873
Fucking dickhead!

52:16.249 --> 52:17.181
Guys!

52:17.183 --> 52:18.019
Run!

52:22.024 --> 52:23.959
That's not cool, man.

52:27.194 --> 52:29.131
Cool special effects.

52:32.700 --> 52:36.769
This isn't corn syrup.

52:44.779 --> 52:46.613
Who ordered a mummy?

52:48.415 --> 52:49.947
Dude.

52:49.949 --> 52:52.752
He even smells
like a real corpse.

54:03.521 --> 54:05.188
Where'd they all go?

54:05.190 --> 54:06.522
- Back to Egypt.
- Luke.

54:06.524 --> 54:07.623
Well I don't know, do I?

54:07.625 --> 54:09.258
Guys.

54:15.399 --> 54:17.133
I think there's something
wrong with Jasmine.

54:17.135 --> 54:19.068
Stop messing about, dude.

54:19.070 --> 54:20.435
I don't like being
cooped up in here you know.

54:20.437 --> 54:21.871
Pull yourself together, Luke.

54:21.873 --> 54:23.072
We need a find a way to get out

54:23.074 --> 54:24.739
before we're torn apart
by fucking Jasmine.

54:24.741 --> 54:27.909
There are worse ways to die.

54:27.911 --> 54:28.743
Amen.

54:28.745 --> 54:29.577
- Luke.
- Tina.

54:29.579 --> 54:30.411
- Max.
- Luke.

54:30.413 --> 54:31.247
- Tina.
- Max.

54:31.249 --> 54:32.380
- Luke!
- Max.

54:32.382 --> 54:33.515
- Tina.
- Hey.

54:33.517 --> 54:35.018
- No, Max.
- Tina.

55:15.624 --> 55:16.892
They're here.

55:35.010 --> 55:36.677
Okay, Tina.

55:36.679 --> 55:38.178
- Maxie.
- No!

55:38.180 --> 55:39.012
No.

55:39.014 --> 55:40.013
But, Tina!

55:40.015 --> 55:41.447
Oi!

55:41.449 --> 55:43.616
I am not losing another
family member, Luke.

55:43.618 --> 55:46.019
You're not a hero, Max.

55:46.021 --> 55:47.453
Hey, Tina, you've
got your car keys?

55:47.455 --> 55:48.588
Check.

55:48.590 --> 55:50.089
I've got the heat.

55:50.091 --> 55:51.557
Now the scream came from
outside, so we're gonna go

55:51.559 --> 55:54.093
'round the back to maintain
the element of surprise.

55:54.095 --> 55:54.929
Let's go.

56:36.535 --> 56:37.802
Fuck.

56:37.804 --> 56:40.604
I am so sick of these
motherfuckin' mummies

56:40.606 --> 56:42.941
on this motherfuckin' farm.

56:42.943 --> 56:43.776
Fuck.

56:59.759 --> 57:01.292
I can't understand
what he's saying.

57:01.294 --> 57:03.626
Can't you just
read the subtitles?

57:03.628 --> 57:04.861
What?

57:04.863 --> 57:07.463
They are saying
the amulet can give

57:07.465 --> 57:10.000
and take away his power.

57:10.002 --> 57:12.870
And there is a missing piece.

57:12.872 --> 57:14.874
They are looking for it.

57:27.320 --> 57:30.453
Are there any other
left alive there?

57:30.455 --> 57:32.357
Jas, what's going on?

57:33.358 --> 57:34.958
I've killed people.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.426
We did.

57:36.428 --> 57:37.659
What?

57:37.661 --> 57:38.593
The others.

57:38.595 --> 57:40.495
Where are the others?

57:40.497 --> 57:42.432
There's a girl, and Duncan.

57:42.434 --> 57:45.002
Her boyfriend, Duncan's friend.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.358
We need to leave, now.

58:07.558 --> 58:08.391
Aye.

58:08.393 --> 58:10.592
We can stop 'em.

58:10.594 --> 58:12.196
We take the amulet.

58:13.430 --> 58:14.264
Now!

58:15.531 --> 58:16.934
Max, no!

01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:06.838
Max!

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.972
Why did you run in like that?

01:00:07.974 --> 01:00:09.441
That was so stupid.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:10.374
Let him be.

01:00:10.376 --> 01:00:11.976
I wanted to help, Tina.

01:00:11.978 --> 01:00:13.177
I wanted to save her.

01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:14.745
So what, if I
don't give you gun,

01:00:14.747 --> 01:00:18.585
that means run in there
like a raving lunatic?

01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:21.422
What did you call me.

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:24.223
No, no, no, no, Max.

01:00:24.225 --> 01:00:27.158
I didn't mean that,
no, no, no, no, Max,

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.993
I didn't mean that, okay?

01:00:28.995 --> 01:00:31.097
What were you gonna do?

01:00:32.832 --> 01:00:37.836
Tina doesn't trust Max, but
Tina doesn't trust Tina.

01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:39.570
Tina's a mess.

01:00:39.572 --> 01:00:41.339
Tina can't fix it.

01:00:41.341 --> 01:00:43.807
I'm sorry okay,
I didn't mean it.

01:00:43.809 --> 01:00:44.641
Max!

01:00:46.645 --> 01:00:49.346
- Max...
- I can look after myself.

01:00:49.348 --> 01:00:50.647
Max, come on, I'm sorry.

01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:52.382
Don't touch me, I'll scream.

01:00:52.384 --> 01:00:53.185
Max.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.196
Oh my god.

01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:42.198
He's right, it is my problem.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.832
No Tina, this is my mess.

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.335
It was my stupid
idea that led us down

01:01:46.337 --> 01:01:48.369
this mummified rabbit hole.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.837
No.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.940
No, I agreed to it.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:52.907
It was my workplace.

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.642
I should have just said no.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:55.944
Come on Tina.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:58.380
All I've done is put
Max in extreme danger.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.715
How are you to know this
is how it was gonna pan out?

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.284
Remember why you did it?

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:03.885
Because I was fucking selfish.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:04.919
No.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.455
That's not why.

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:07.855
Remember why you said yes.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.191
No, I did it for him, for Max.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:11.027
Exactly.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:12.896
And now...

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:18.066
And now I have to
finish it for him.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.900
You can't call the police,
what are you gonna tell them?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.803
I'm not calling the cops.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.516
Hi, mom.

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:13.419
I know I haven't texted
you in a few hours.

01:03:13.421 --> 01:03:15.323
I've been kind of busy.

01:03:16.524 --> 01:03:19.860
Things haven't been
going good recently.

01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:24.229
It's been kind of tough.

01:03:24.231 --> 01:03:28.033
Things haven't been
great with Tina.

01:03:28.035 --> 01:03:29.704
I know she loves me.

01:03:30.837 --> 01:03:33.608
She just doesn't
seem very happy.

01:03:35.842 --> 01:03:38.680
Anyway, I hope you
are doing okay.

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:43.283
I know you can hear me.

01:03:44.284 --> 01:03:45.687
I miss you a lot.

01:03:48.088 --> 01:03:50.989
I wish you were still here.

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:52.159
Love you, mom.

01:03:53.026 --> 01:03:53.860
Max.

01:04:36.602 --> 01:04:37.835
Tina?

01:04:37.837 --> 01:04:38.836
- Have you seen them again?
- Nothin'.

01:04:38.838 --> 01:04:40.237
I don't want to go in last,

01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:41.438
and I wish the
mummies weren't here,

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.140
but she'll be coming
any minute now.

01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:46.042
It's like trying to find
the needle in the mummy.

01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:47.276
Luke, please don't.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.314
Wait.

01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:56.452
Karen.

01:04:56.454 --> 01:04:57.320
Tina.

01:04:57.322 --> 01:04:59.188
- Karen.
- Luke.

01:05:00.124 --> 01:05:01.824
Karen.

01:05:01.826 --> 01:05:03.160
I was worried.

01:05:04.529 --> 01:05:07.462
I thought I was going to
encounter one of those things.

01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:08.699
Have you seen any?

01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:11.367
Yes, Karen, that's
why we called you.

01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:13.870
Now, I'm not going to
get into what it's doing

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:15.271
all the way out here missy.

01:05:15.273 --> 01:05:16.372
Now is not the time.

01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:18.276
- Karen...
- Quiet, Luke.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:23.078
I'm largely leaning towards
not saying a peep if,

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.515
and it's a big if, you
help me get the mummy

01:05:26.517 --> 01:05:28.216
back in the box.

01:05:28.218 --> 01:05:31.086
Tell us what we need to do.

01:05:31.088 --> 01:05:32.921
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

01:05:32.923 --> 01:05:34.389
The amulet is the source
of the mummy's power,

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:36.858
but it can also take
his powers away,

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.193
and the only way you can
get him back to sleep

01:05:38.195 --> 01:05:40.862
is to cram him back
into his coffin?

01:05:40.864 --> 01:05:43.330
And also sometimes when he's
around, the weather changes.

01:05:43.332 --> 01:05:44.566
Exactly.

01:05:44.568 --> 01:05:45.366
Very well summarized
for everyone listening

01:05:45.368 --> 01:05:46.835
in this circle, Luke.

01:05:46.837 --> 01:05:49.970
Although it's slightly more
of a box than a coffin.

01:05:49.972 --> 01:05:51.972
What we need to do: we
have to cause a distraction

01:05:51.974 --> 01:05:53.207
and get them outside.

01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:54.708
You run back into
the house, Tina,

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.378
steal back the other
half of the amulet.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.579
Okay, yeah, I can do this.

01:05:57.581 --> 01:05:58.880
- I can see this through.
- That's right Tina.

01:05:58.882 --> 01:06:00.282
Yes, you can.

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:01.817
We're bloody lucky
somebody broke that amulet,

01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:03.017
otherwise the mummy's
powers would be

01:06:03.019 --> 01:06:04.853
damn near unstoppable.

01:06:04.855 --> 01:06:06.922
Whoever broke it has
given us a shot at

01:06:06.924 --> 01:06:09.425
saving the entire world today.

01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:13.127
I've got something
to tell you guys.

01:06:13.129 --> 01:06:14.528
Max.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.629
Max.

01:06:15.631 --> 01:06:16.799
I am so sorry.

01:06:18.801 --> 01:06:21.067
I didn't mean it,
I promise, okay?

01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:23.303
I'm gonna make it better again.

01:06:23.305 --> 01:06:25.373
I promise, I am so sorry.

01:06:26.609 --> 01:06:27.675
Are you okay?

01:06:27.677 --> 01:06:29.175
Huh?

01:06:29.177 --> 01:06:32.045
I know where the missing
piece of the amulet is.

01:06:32.047 --> 01:06:32.848
How?

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:36.416
Great.

01:06:36.418 --> 01:06:38.016
Max and Tina, back inside.

01:06:38.018 --> 01:06:39.486
Try and find that
piece of the amulet.

01:06:40.322 --> 01:06:42.254
Karen, you're with me.

01:06:42.256 --> 01:06:44.692
Let's go bag ourselves a milf.

01:06:44.694 --> 01:06:45.527
Hoo rah!

01:06:55.035 --> 01:06:56.769
Oi, dickhead.

01:07:14.355 --> 01:07:16.524
Damn, I wish Max was here.

01:08:55.586 --> 01:08:57.755
Come on, get the amulet.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:01.823
Max, come on.

01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:02.758
I'm looking, Tina.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.526
We don't have a lot of time.

01:09:14.505 --> 01:09:15.339
Max?

01:09:16.307 --> 01:09:17.408
Max, come on.

01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:19.443
Come on, Max.

01:09:21.112 --> 01:09:22.810
Found it.

01:09:30.654 --> 01:09:31.719
Eh, I'm not
finished with you yet

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.456
you bandagy dickhead.

01:10:09.758 --> 01:10:12.761
Is that all you've
got, Cleopatra?

01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:10.168
It could have been
different between us.

01:13:50.672 --> 01:13:52.240
Finish her.

01:14:12.527 --> 01:14:13.361
Max.

01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:16.896
The gun.

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:22.337
You said not to use the gun.

01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:24.339
Use the gun.

01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:33.681
I've only got one mummy now.

01:14:34.848 --> 01:14:36.617
And her name is Tina.

01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:42.054
Max.

01:14:42.056 --> 01:14:42.890
Max, Max.

01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:45.293
Max.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.893
Max.

01:14:47.895 --> 01:14:51.298
Max, come on, you're
gonna be okay, all right?

01:14:52.633 --> 01:14:54.900
You're gonna be fine.

01:14:54.902 --> 01:14:56.335
I'll stop this bleeding.

01:14:56.337 --> 01:14:59.271
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna fine.

01:14:59.273 --> 01:15:01.539
You're fine, I
promise, you're fine.

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:03.375
You're gonna be okay.

01:15:03.377 --> 01:15:05.143
It's all over now.

01:15:05.145 --> 01:15:06.544
I'm a hero.

01:15:06.546 --> 01:15:07.812
Yes, you are.

01:15:07.814 --> 01:15:10.216
You are, Max, you are a hero.

01:15:11.184 --> 01:15:12.917
Yes you are.

01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:14.153
You're my hero.

01:15:17.223 --> 01:15:18.655
Max.

01:15:18.657 --> 01:15:19.489
I love you.

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:24.830
Max, Max.

01:15:26.265 --> 01:15:27.398
Max!

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.232
Max!

01:15:28.234 --> 01:15:29.833
Max, wait, no!

01:15:29.835 --> 01:15:31.134
Max, please.

01:15:31.136 --> 01:15:33.971
Wake up, come on, this
isn't funny Max, please.

01:15:33.973 --> 01:15:35.172
Max, wake up.

01:15:35.174 --> 01:15:37.074
Please wake up.

01:15:37.076 --> 01:15:39.145
Max, Max, Max, it's fine.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.381
Come on, wake up, come on.

01:15:43.383 --> 01:15:46.217
Max come on, please
don't do this to me.

01:15:46.219 --> 01:15:47.650
I can't lose you, Max.

01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:50.153
I can't lose you,
please don't leave me.

01:18:14.829 --> 01:18:16.063
I understand.

01:18:23.737 --> 01:18:24.905
Martin's dead.

01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:29.743
And the amulet?

01:18:36.016 --> 01:18:38.183
Initiate order seven.
