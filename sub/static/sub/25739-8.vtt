00:09.596 --> 00:11.637
(spy theme music playing)

00:15.637 --> 00:17.887
-Holy smokes, we fixed it.
-We did it.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.596
Just to recap everything:
By plugging in this thumb drive,

00:20.678 --> 00:23.012
we're committing
an act of treason
against the government

00:23.095 --> 00:26.220
in support of
an extremist organization,
known as the Labcoats.

00:26.304 --> 00:28.095
Who are the ones
who are trying to foil

00:28.179 --> 00:30.554
the U.S. government's plan
to nuke New York City,

00:30.637 --> 00:33.387
thus saving
all the animals,
which is a good thing.

00:33.471 --> 00:34.845
They're also
the extremist group

00:34.928 --> 00:36.887
that killed all the humans
in the first place.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.262
So, that's a bad thing?

00:38.346 --> 00:40.054
That's pretty bad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40.137 --> 00:43.387
But if we plug this in,
the Labcoats are gonna
pay us $10 million,

00:43.471 --> 00:47.137
which we'll parlay
into nice one-bedrooms
in Hackensack, New Jersey.

00:47.845 --> 00:48.720
Sick.

00:48.803 --> 00:50.304
Both:
We're gonna do it.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.970
You just gotta--
You just gotta turn it.

00:56.054 --> 00:57.762
-Yeah. I got it, I got it.
-I never know
which way to turn these.

00:57.845 --> 01:00.054
I know. Having trouble
finding the hole.
I've been there before.

01:00.137 --> 01:01.928
-(shouts)
-(electricity crackles)

01:02.012 --> 01:04.054
Did... Did we do it?

01:04.137 --> 01:06.637
I don't know.
Oh, check your phone.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.970
Maybe they, like, Venmoed us
or something like that.

01:09.054 --> 01:10.262
I don't have the Venmo app.

01:10.346 --> 01:12.054
Did you call it
"the Venmo app"?

01:12.137 --> 01:13.637
-Whatever.
-What are you, 50?

01:13.720 --> 01:15.803
I just don't trust that stuff--
PayPal, Venmo, all that.

01:15.887 --> 01:18.137
-Do you... Do you hear that?
-(muffled music playing)

01:18.220 --> 01:19.928

-(electronic chiming)

01:20.012 --> 01:22.471
Whoa, dude.
Whoa, dude!

01:22.554 --> 01:24.970
-Mike: What the...?
-Oh, shit, man!

01:25.054 --> 01:26.970
-(screams)
-Oh, fuck, Mikey!

01:27.054 --> 01:28.762
-What's happening, dude?
-I don't know!

01:28.845 --> 01:31.262
-(cheering)
-Man: Yes!

01:31.346 --> 01:34.429
Look at that, they did it.
They actually did it!

01:34.512 --> 01:37.596
Three years in the bunker
and Phil and Mike
finally treasoned.

01:37.678 --> 01:39.137
(stammering):
Well...

01:39.220 --> 01:41.179
That's gotta be a record
for So You Think
You Won't Treason .

01:41.262 --> 01:43.304
-Shit, record.
-I mean, I didn't
actually think they'd do it.

01:43.387 --> 01:44.970
No, I knew
you'd do it, boys.

01:45.054 --> 01:47.262
I knew it all along.
Congratulations!

01:47.346 --> 01:50.262
-Thank you so much, sir.
-You fucking pieces of shit!

01:50.346 --> 01:52.137
-Copy that.
-Let's get you
over here, if we can.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.471
-Yeah!
-Yeah, yeah.

01:53.554 --> 01:54.845
-That's really good.
-Stand up straight!

01:54.928 --> 01:56.262
What's...
What's going on, buddy?

01:56.346 --> 01:58.012
Right down the barrel
if you can, okay?

01:58.095 --> 01:59.262
Really smile, boys.

01:59.346 --> 02:01.095
You have no idea
what's ahead of you.

02:01.179 --> 02:02.304
Oh, wow.
Say "treason."

02:02.387 --> 02:03.970
-Hi, America.
-Yeah, there you go.

02:04.054 --> 02:06.137
-Say hi. And bye.
-I think we've done it.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.512
Copy that.
So we'll go with you guys?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.637
-Sapphire: Nope.
-Sounds good, copy that.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.637
-Cool.
-So you guys are
all in the business?

02:13.720 --> 02:14.803
-That's cool.
-Cool.

02:14.887 --> 02:16.637
We're writing stuff, so.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.512
We definitely have some ideas,
if anybody's, like, interested.

02:19.596 --> 02:21.054
It's an animated show,
it's for kids.

02:21.137 --> 02:23.179
There's sci-fi,
and it stars Plonky.

02:23.262 --> 02:24.512
Um...

02:24.596 --> 02:26.346
-He's right over there, so.
-Mike: Plonky!

02:26.429 --> 02:29.346
So you guys saw everything
that we did this whole time?

02:29.429 --> 02:30.970
Even the orange thing?

02:31.054 --> 02:33.220
-He's nodding,
so that was a yes.
-So the orange incident.

02:33.304 --> 02:35.387
-That's an affirmative
from the government.
-They got the orange incident.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.720
Phil:
All right, that's it.
That's all from me.

02:37.803 --> 02:39.387

02:40.429 --> 02:42.012

02:43.554 --> 02:46.637

a fucking coward.

Let's dance, motherfucker.

02:48.262 --> 02:49.179

02:49.262 --> 02:51.678
I'll die for Jim Carrey,
I will.

02:51.762 --> 02:54.346
Also, I'm secretly
in love with you.

02:54.429 --> 02:58.387
Get off me.
I'm here with my wife,
Sofía Vergara.

we lost him there.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.262
Yeah, I don't
see him anywhere.

03:24.346 --> 03:25.887
I mean,
we looked over there.

03:25.970 --> 03:29.554
-We looked over there.
-We looked over there.

03:29.637 --> 03:31.012
What about the closet?

03:31.095 --> 03:32.512
No rat would be
dumb enough

03:45.012 --> 03:47.596
When did you...
When did you have a Popsicle?

03:47.678 --> 03:48.970
Just earlier today.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.471
I thought we were doing
the diet thing together.

03:50.554 --> 03:52.095
Yeah, no, it was a Skinny Cow,

03:52.179 --> 03:53.637
so it was under
the calories and everything.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.220
-What the fuck?
-What's wrong?

03:55.304 --> 03:57.387

What the fuck,
Emperor Mike?

-Emperor Phil...
-What the fuck?

04:03.012 --> 04:04.429
You know where
the ice cream is!

04:04.512 --> 04:07.095
I don't know where
the ice cream is, Emperor Mike!

04:07.179 --> 04:08.928
I haven't gotten
my own food

-And you promised me!
-Okay.

04:15.012 --> 04:17.304
You promised me that we would
go on this diet together!

04:56.887 --> 04:58.928
the next time
we play "cat chases rat,"

04:59.012 --> 05:01.678
perhaps I could not
be the rat?

-You are the rat,
so just be the rat.

it's a never-ending,
immersive experience.

05:21.803 --> 05:24.678
Perhaps, just in order
to keep up the whole
immersive experience,

05:24.762 --> 05:27.346
we could replace
Nikolai in a rat costume

05:27.429 --> 05:29.678
with I don't know,
like, an actual rat?

'cause I'm young Hollywood.
But Phil? No.

05:50.678 --> 05:52.387
I haven't spoken to him
since I won the trial.

05:52.471 --> 05:54.387
Are they superimposing Phil
on the screen right now?

05:54.471 --> 05:56.387
Just make sure that
I'm taller, like in real life.

-Jesus, the APP thing again.

07:54.762 --> 07:57.346
Listen, Phil, we know
it's been a passion project.

07:57.429 --> 07:59.346
But we can't consent
to you going

07:59.429 --> 08:01.471
into enemy territory
because of a letter.

08:01.554 --> 08:03.845
It's not even notarized.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.637
Didn't even notarize it?
It's a death march!

08:05.720 --> 08:06.678
Who doesn't notarize?

08:06.762 --> 08:08.012
You gotta "motorize" it.

08:08.095 --> 08:09.678
My butler mom's got
a motorized scooter.

08:09.762 --> 08:11.554
-It's changed her life.
-Wow.

08:11.637 --> 08:14.220
You know what I think?
I think Matarese here
is still trying to make up

08:14.304 --> 08:16.471
for losing his stupid
fucking trial!

08:16.554 --> 08:17.803
-Yes.
-Totally agree.

08:17.887 --> 08:20.054
He decided to circumvent
the chain of command

08:20.137 --> 08:22.304
to get what he wanted--
fame, glory.

08:22.387 --> 08:24.845
Well, I say
go for it, Matarese.

08:24.928 --> 08:27.720
Wait. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

08:27.803 --> 08:30.179
I hereby grant you
full travel permissions

08:30.262 --> 08:33.220
into Unsanctioned Sector KS 214,

08:33.304 --> 08:35.179
also known as...

08:35.262 --> 08:38.054
(in demonic voice):
the Democratic People's
Republic of Kitty City!

08:38.137 --> 08:40.054
I understand the risks
and accept.

08:40.137 --> 08:41.720
You two are in
Orb's hands now.

08:41.803 --> 08:43.095
Wait, what do you
mean "you two"?

08:43.179 --> 08:45.220
Jesus Christ,
just tell Tom Holland

08:45.304 --> 08:47.054
I'll meet him at Zumiez.

08:47.137 --> 08:49.762
Trotts! I saw your set
at the Cellar the other night.
So funny.

08:49.845 --> 08:52.095
I had to follow Jeselnik,
but thank you, thank you.
I do okay.

08:52.179 --> 08:54.054
McManus!
Lookin' thin, buddy.

08:54.137 --> 08:55.887
Yeah. I've had
diarrhea for a month.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.429
Thank God I have
hardwood floors.

08:57.512 --> 08:59.928
-Mayor Jacob,
always a pleasure.
-(chuckles) Sick.

09:00.012 --> 09:04.346
Okay. Well, clearly,
The Emperors of KC
saw my various hosting gigs

09:04.429 --> 09:06.845
and wanted a sit-down,
on-camera exclusive
with yours truly.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.262
My team and I have been
workshopping some stuff.

09:09.346 --> 09:10.387
Here's what we're thinking.

09:10.471 --> 09:12.220
VICE meets that
Seth Rogen movie

09:12.304 --> 09:13.720
meets Nick News
with Linda Ellerbee.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.387
And we'll have
like a real run-gun setup,

09:15.471 --> 09:17.095
real Duplass Bros kind of
artful camera work,

09:17.179 --> 09:19.095
leave room for improvisation
if need be, that kind of stuff.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.762
I heard Room 104 was good.

09:20.845 --> 09:23.095
What is he doing here?
For Orb's sake!
I mean, come on!

09:23.179 --> 09:24.970
What? What? What happened?

09:25.054 --> 09:26.304
These Kitty City emperors

09:26.387 --> 09:28.803
also requested
the presence of Mike.

09:28.887 --> 09:30.720
Looks like the band's
back together.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.928
Fucking reunion show
nobody asked for.

09:33.012 --> 09:35.137
Why would The Emperors
request Mike too?

09:35.220 --> 09:37.304
-Something's not right.
-You both got your mission.

09:37.387 --> 09:40.928
-But just know this:
By entering the DPRKC...
-(McManus snoring)

09:41.012 --> 09:43.596
...you're going off the map,
into the darkness.

09:43.678 --> 09:44.887
I'll be honest.

09:44.970 --> 09:47.429
No one's ever come
out of Kitty City alive.

09:47.512 --> 09:49.637
Here, take
Ruber Force One.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.012
Orb speed
to you both.

09:52.137 --> 09:54.596
Okay, Ruber Force One
should be around...

09:54.678 --> 09:55.720
(Phil gasps)

09:55.803 --> 09:57.304
-Mike: What?
-Phil: Is that...?

09:57.387 --> 09:58.471
Both:
Wallet!

09:58.554 --> 10:00.346
(both cheering)

10:00.429 --> 10:01.637
Yes, dude!

10:01.720 --> 10:03.346
Wait, so he's
Ruber Force One?

10:03.429 --> 10:05.928
-Oh, my God!
-We're gonna go
and ride inside of him!

10:06.012 --> 10:08.471
I actually heard he was
baked in a cotton candy factory.

10:08.554 --> 10:10.596
I heard he was made
in a molasses factory

10:10.678 --> 10:12.304
'cause he's sweet
and dense.

10:12.387 --> 10:13.637
Wait, can I poke
your belly?

10:13.720 --> 10:14.803
-(squeaks)
-(both squeal)

10:14.887 --> 10:16.095
He squeaks!

10:16.179 --> 10:18.137
-All right,
let's get in.
-Yeah!

10:18.220 --> 10:19.970
God, it's
incredible in here!

10:20.054 --> 10:21.678
I should be
documenting this.

10:21.762 --> 10:23.304
All right, Philly boy,
I'm gonna need you
to be my one-man crew.

10:23.387 --> 10:24.970
-Phil: Nope.
-Okay, we're talking
hair and makeup.

10:25.054 --> 10:27.637
-Nope. No.
-Cameraman. DIT,
whatever the fuck that is.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.471
You're so fucking
weird now, dude!

10:29.554 --> 10:32.304
-I'm not weird!
-You have a GoPro,
just film your little thing.

10:32.387 --> 10:35.512
-Phil: Put your shirt down.
-Mike: Fuck it!
We'll do it live!

10:35.596 --> 10:37.429
(both screaming)

10:37.512 --> 10:38.970
(heavy metal music playing)

10:39.054 --> 10:40.220
(alarms wailing)

10:40.304 --> 10:42.346
♪ I spent the best
years of my youth ♪

10:42.429 --> 10:44.970
♪ Highlighting my
classroom notes ♪

10:45.054 --> 10:46.720
♪ Studying those... ♪

10:46.803 --> 10:48.095
Blah!

10:48.970 --> 10:50.012
Holy shit!

10:50.095 --> 10:52.179
Mike:
We're in Kitty City again.

10:52.262 --> 10:54.970
This is freaky.
Okay, thanks
for the ride, Wallet.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.387
-We'll see you later.
-Thanks, buddy.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.179
-All right, so, uh--
-Phil, hear me out on this.

10:58.262 --> 11:00.554
If it's about bringing him
along with us, then yes.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.678
Great. Wallet,
get over here, buddy.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.179
-(squeaks)
-Hey, Wallet, you ever
see a phone before?

11:05.262 --> 11:06.179
(phone chimes)

11:06.262 --> 11:08.137
-Oh, ho!
-He likes that.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.387
Oh, my God.
He is holding your hand.

11:10.471 --> 11:11.970
Just intrinsically.

11:12.054 --> 11:14.054
He's just looking
at his phone
and he reached up.

11:14.137 --> 11:15.762
He's holding your pinky.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.762
Not quite the welcome
I was expecting.

11:20.845 --> 11:23.887
Thought they'd have like
a branded step-and-repeat
or something.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.762
Someone's gotta
come welcome us, right?

11:25.845 --> 11:27.512
They said there'd
be someone.

11:27.596 --> 11:29.346
-(screams)
-(squeaks)

11:29.429 --> 11:32.054
There they are,
our ambassadors.

11:32.137 --> 11:34.054
-Hello, I am Nikolai.
-Hi, Nikolai.

11:34.137 --> 11:36.095
I am the assistant
to The Emperors,
so nice to meet you.

11:36.179 --> 11:38.220
We are incredibly
humbled by this experience--

11:38.304 --> 11:39.512
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:39.596 --> 11:41.512
Who's the round one?
We didn't order him.

11:41.596 --> 11:43.554
Oh, that's Mike.
We used to be best friends,

11:43.637 --> 11:45.928
-but we had a big trial.
This whole thing happened.
-What the fuck, dude?

11:46.012 --> 11:47.887
No, I'm clear
on you two rats.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.346
I'm talking about
the pigeon.

11:49.429 --> 11:50.512
Oh, Wallet!

11:50.596 --> 11:52.387
-He's our social
media liaison.
-Yeah.

11:52.471 --> 11:54.179
Well, we should've
gotten clearance.

11:54.262 --> 11:56.262
But my goodness,
he is so huggable.

11:56.346 --> 11:57.346
-Right?
-Yes!

11:57.429 --> 11:59.387
Exactly.
Huggable's the word.

11:59.471 --> 12:00.762
-He's so sick.
-Why don't we head off?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.887
Welcome to the
glorious DPRKC.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.554
-Wow!
-Wow.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.304
Over there is our
local convenience store.

12:08.387 --> 12:09.720
Over there is our post office.

12:09.803 --> 12:11.095
Wow, look at that.

12:11.179 --> 12:12.429
Well, that looks nice,
what's that?

12:12.512 --> 12:14.387
The DPRKC hotel.

12:14.471 --> 12:17.304
That's right. We have all
the normal amenities here.

12:17.387 --> 12:20.596
We have a bellboy,
there's a doorman, a concierge.

12:20.678 --> 12:22.928
I don't really know
what they do!
Keep driving, Nikolai!

12:23.012 --> 12:25.429
And this is our local
watering hole.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.803
Ha-ha!
I am very drunk!

12:29.720 --> 12:33.220
Luckily in the DPRKC,
every hour is happy hour!

12:33.304 --> 12:34.720
-Whoa!
-(Nikolai laughing)

12:34.803 --> 12:35.928
-Sounds good.
-Isn't that great?

12:36.012 --> 12:37.304
That's a great line.

12:37.387 --> 12:39.429
Yeah. That wasn't a line.
He was just talking.

12:39.512 --> 12:41.095
Sure. Okay, yeah.
Just normal conversations.

12:41.179 --> 12:42.429
-All right,
let's get outta here.
-Okay.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.346
Nikolai: The historic
Emperor's Palace.

12:45.429 --> 12:47.596
-Mike: Whoa.
-Phil: Shit, dude.

12:47.678 --> 12:49.429
Mike: Dude, you think
they're gonna send
girl cats to our room?

12:49.512 --> 12:51.637
Phil: What the fuck?
Come on, Mike.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.429
-It's something that happens
when you go to other countries.
-Phil: No, it's not!

12:53.512 --> 12:55.304
Why is he so frantic?
Did you give him sugar
on the way here?

12:55.387 --> 12:57.970
-Wallet, Daddy's worked
too hard on his APP...
-(Wallet gags)

12:58.054 --> 12:59.304
...to not have it
signed now.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.637
I'm at the finish line.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.179
I don't need
your flappin' and flailin'

13:02.262 --> 13:03.637
and fucking this all up for me.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.304
-I'm sorry for cursing.
-It's okay. And Wallet?

13:05.387 --> 13:08.262
I need to get super
fucking famous, okay?
Sorry for cursing.

13:08.346 --> 13:12.137
Phil and Mike,
I present to you,
The Emperors.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.970
(fanfare plays)

13:14.054 --> 13:15.970
Nikolai, kick the carpet out.

13:16.054 --> 13:18.554
-The carpet,
it got caught. Kick it.
-Sorry. Yes, sir.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.762
Both:
Oh, my God.

13:21.845 --> 13:23.095
Emperor Mike:
There they are!

13:23.179 --> 13:25.179
-Nikolai, you've
outdone yourself!
-So good.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.512
I know, right?
And that little
blue one right there?

13:27.596 --> 13:28.887
-Yeah?
-It's named Wallet.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.387
His name's Wallet?

13:30.471 --> 13:31.678
Yes. He was free.

13:31.762 --> 13:32.845
Oh, my God.
There they are.

13:32.928 --> 13:34.137
Can you tell I'm high?

13:34.220 --> 13:35.720
Um, hello.

13:35.803 --> 13:37.845
Can you tell
I'm stoned, Nikolai?

13:37.928 --> 13:39.304
I thought you said
tell them hi.

13:39.387 --> 13:41.678
Me and Mike smoked
a "deutsch" before this.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.471
Hello, sirs.

13:43.554 --> 13:44.845
My name is
Phillip Matarese

13:44.928 --> 13:46.179
and I've been
sent here on behalf

13:46.262 --> 13:47.720
of the rest of the animals
of New York City.

13:47.803 --> 13:48.887
Did you just
do a bump, dude?

13:48.970 --> 13:50.471
Oh! Mike Luciano, here.

13:50.554 --> 13:51.678
-How we doing, emps?
-What is this?

13:51.762 --> 13:53.678
(British accent):
How you doin'? Okay.

13:53.762 --> 13:55.512
-Here we are inside Kitty City.
-An accent too?
That's not necessary.

13:55.596 --> 13:57.220
-The two emperors...
-Guys, we got the APP.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.471
We just need
you to sign here.

13:59.554 --> 14:01.137
Would you shut
the fuck up, Mike?

14:01.220 --> 14:02.845
(normal voice):
What are you doing?
You're ruining my shot!

14:02.928 --> 14:04.845
You're ruining
my big moment in the
light of history, dude!

14:04.928 --> 14:07.928
This is my big moment
in the bright lights of fame!

14:08.012 --> 14:09.720
Fucking idiot!
Get the fuck...

14:09.803 --> 14:11.720
(rats squeaking)

14:11.803 --> 14:14.429
-Phil, Mike, silence.
-(panting)

14:14.512 --> 14:15.887
You seem to be
under the impression

14:15.970 --> 14:18.220
that you're here
for any sort of purpose.

14:18.304 --> 14:21.678
You were both just
on TV at the right time.
It's that simple.

14:21.762 --> 14:24.762
Chaos reigns
and The Emperors rule.

14:24.845 --> 14:26.387
-(metal scrapes)
-(whirring)

14:26.471 --> 14:28.387
You see, they have hunted
all kinds of animals.

14:28.471 --> 14:30.887
Bear, boar, Borland.

14:30.970 --> 14:34.887
But now, they wish to hunt
the most dangerous game of all.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.179
Rat!

14:36.262 --> 14:37.678
Nikolai, you did us
dirty, didn't ya?

14:37.762 --> 14:38.928
-I did.
-You're a bad guy?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.720
I'm a bad guy, yeah.

14:40.803 --> 14:42.720
So basically,
we're just gonna chase you
through a series of rooms

14:42.803 --> 14:44.387
beginning with that
little door, right there.

14:44.471 --> 14:45.554
Emperor Mike:
That's the one.

14:45.637 --> 14:46.762
Wait, what's he
talking about "door?"

14:46.845 --> 14:48.095
Wait, this has got
to be a joke, right?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.262
All right, time's up.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.554
Let's get the wheels
going on this.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.262
Here we go.
Let the chase begin!

14:52.346 --> 14:54.471
(indistinct shouting)

14:58.012 --> 14:59.928
Mmm! Mmm...

15:00.012 --> 15:01.970
Jacob:
That chicken's really
killing it today, huh?

15:02.054 --> 15:04.262
-(clears throat)
Can I say something?
-Jacob: Oh, go ahead.

15:04.346 --> 15:05.887
I don't wanna
be out of line,

15:05.970 --> 15:08.095
but it feels good not to have
Phil or Mike here for a bit.

15:08.179 --> 15:09.596
Oh, yeah, I'm really
glad you said that.

15:09.678 --> 15:10.887
I feel like I can talk

15:10.970 --> 15:12.095
and not everyone's going like,

15:12.179 --> 15:13.928
"Hey, what's up
with your egg brains"?

How do I be better?

22:41.596 --> 22:43.346
I mean, I'm a deadbeat dad,

not the best idea

23:05.596 --> 23:06.887
That makes a lot of sense.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.137
Ain't it funny they
call it makin' a livin'

23:09.220 --> 23:10.970
like you're already
dead or something?

23:12.179 --> 23:13.887
I mean, what the fuck
you wanna do with your life?

23:13.970 --> 23:15.554
I mean, what is
this all about?

23:15.637 --> 23:17.471
I just wanna help animals.

23:17.554 --> 23:19.095
Whoa, whoa.
You know what you should do?

23:19.179 --> 23:21.471
-What's that?
-Have a big ol' music festival.

23:21.554 --> 23:23.928
Wayne's World 2- style.

23:24.012 --> 23:26.928
You get all the
animals together
and fucking jam it out.

23:27.012 --> 23:28.970
Even before
the Grand Communicator,

23:29.054 --> 23:31.262
music was the
universal language.

23:31.346 --> 23:32.928
That's a great way to open up

23:33.012 --> 23:35.095
the other species
to one another, you know.

23:35.179 --> 23:37.220
Call it something
dumb and catchy,

23:37.304 --> 23:39.220
you know, like,
Roachella.

23:39.304 --> 23:41.554
-Whoa. Roachella.
-(chuckling)

23:41.637 --> 23:44.262
I like that. That's good.

23:44.346 --> 23:46.596
-Mike (echoing): Phil!
-I think I gotta go.

23:46.678 --> 23:49.596
Uh, I'll see you around, Dad.
Thanks for the advice.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.012
Yeah, see you, Phil.

23:56.262 --> 23:58.179
Wallet, stop giving him
cotton candy. Come on.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.803
I don't know.
A couple more cotton candies
might do him some good.

24:00.887 --> 24:02.678
-Phil. Phil!
He's awake.
-What?

24:02.762 --> 24:04.137
Hey, man.
I'm so sorry.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.429
I didn't know
you were such
a lightweight.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.137
Freshman.
(chuckles)

24:07.220 --> 24:09.304
I-- I had the
craziest dream.

24:09.387 --> 24:10.678
Really? Was I there?

24:10.762 --> 24:12.346
And was he there?
And was Wallet there, too?

24:12.429 --> 24:14.429
-(squeaks)
-No, no, no, no.
I wanted Wallet to be there.

24:14.512 --> 24:16.304
But no, it was my fucking dad.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.762
It was in outer space
and I saw my dad.

24:18.845 --> 24:20.803
-Whoa.
-That shit was
no joke, Nikolai.

24:20.887 --> 24:23.596
Anyway, he said I should
put on a music festival.

24:23.678 --> 24:25.095
Like a Wayne's World 2
kind of festival.

24:25.179 --> 24:26.803
-Yeah, yeah!
-Like with all
the animal species?

24:26.887 --> 24:28.512
-Yeah!
-Like, coming together?

24:28.596 --> 24:30.304
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
The Emperors just
recorded an album.

24:30.387 --> 24:33.179
(harmonizing):
♪ Poo-poo, pee-pee, poo ♪

24:33.262 --> 24:34.512
♪ Meow ♪

24:34.596 --> 24:35.678
I'm their manager.
You should put them on.

24:35.762 --> 24:36.887
What? The Emperors?

24:36.970 --> 24:38.803
I saw them at
Silent Bar last week.

24:38.887 --> 24:40.678
It was a nice time.

24:40.762 --> 24:42.387
You know what?
Actually, that's a good idea.

24:42.471 --> 24:43.970
Having performers
from the DPRKC

24:44.054 --> 24:46.346
means strides
in democratic relations.

24:46.429 --> 24:48.346
It'll be an all-day thing,
with multiple tents,

24:48.429 --> 24:51.012
and Wallet can, like,
sell cotton candy

24:51.095 --> 24:53.012
or, like, I don't know,
he could, like, be
a bouncy house.

24:53.095 --> 24:54.845
It's the new
Green Day tradition.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.346
The new Green Day
tradition is Roachella,

24:57.429 --> 24:59.346
which is what we're calling it.
We're married to the name.

24:59.429 --> 25:01.304
-It can't change.
-We know. It's gonna
be so much fun.

25:01.387 --> 25:03.179
-Any questions?
-Any questions anybody?

25:03.262 --> 25:07.220
So, you went to Kitty City
to get a peace pact signed,

25:07.304 --> 25:09.387
and came back
with the idea

25:09.471 --> 25:12.346
to throw a big concert
with all the animals?

25:12.429 --> 25:14.387
-Mm-hmm.
Wayne's World 2 -style...
-That's right.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.720
...is what we're going for.

25:15.803 --> 25:17.429
Timeline-wise,
like, two weeks?

25:17.512 --> 25:18.720
Mike:
Yeah and it'll be sick.

25:20.304 --> 25:22.554
I think we, as a committee,
tend to overthink things.

25:22.637 --> 25:24.720
A whole gathering
of animals and music?

25:24.803 --> 25:25.845
Can't lose.

25:25.928 --> 25:27.054
(animals agreeing)

25:27.137 --> 25:28.387
You know what?
You're right, can't lose.

25:28.471 --> 25:30.179
-That makes me
think of something.
-Yeah.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.928
Now, this is something
that I've been thinking about

25:32.012 --> 25:33.596
-for a while. Follow me here.
-Yeah.

25:33.678 --> 25:36.429
Are the Krabby Patties from
SpongeBob made of actual crab?

25:36.512 --> 25:38.720
Of course Krabby Patties
are made of crab.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.262
What the fuck
do you think they're made of?

25:40.346 --> 25:42.387
(all arguing)

25:42.471 --> 25:45.387
Are you kidding me?
Are we actually debating that?

25:45.471 --> 25:47.512
-What the fuck?
-The chef is a crab.

25:47.596 --> 25:49.054
So it'd be weird
if he was serving crab?

25:49.137 --> 25:51.012
You guys don't know
shit about SpongeBob.

25:51.095 --> 25:53.512
Bob Balaban, huge fan,
but you are dead wrong.

25:53.596 --> 25:56.887
This is Bob motherfucking
Balaban, okay?

25:56.970 --> 25:58.762
You listen to this fucker!

25:58.845 --> 26:00.387
Okay, thank you, Trotts.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.429
So where did we leave off
with the Roachella thing?

26:02.512 --> 26:03.596
Are we...
we're doing it?

26:03.678 --> 26:05.304
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:05.387 --> 26:07.262
What does Wallet say?

26:07.346 --> 26:08.429
Do the honors, Phil.

26:08.512 --> 26:10.554
Wallet, I know
you'd never lie to me.

26:10.637 --> 26:14.054
Should we do
Roachella in two weeks?

26:16.887 --> 26:19.429
-That always--
-That's just like a random one.
You should do it again.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.387
-(sloshing)
-Yes!

26:21.471 --> 26:23.429
All right, fuck it!
Let's do it!

26:23.512 --> 26:25.262
(all cheering)

26:25.346 --> 26:29.262
All (chanting):
Wallet! Wallet!
Wallet! Wallet!

26:29.346 --> 26:31.054

another Wallet episode.

Oh, my God.
I hate it when people--
They call asking for it...

26:46.429 --> 26:47.678
And we went out to dinner.

26:47.762 --> 26:51.637
And now I'm getting

26:51.720 --> 26:54.512

they're... so they...
-It's like insane.

26:54.596 --> 26:56.637

It's like, gross.

27:04.512 --> 27:06.304
Now I feel like,
was that even fun?

27:06.387 --> 27:09.512
Right, now it's a job.
Now it's like a job
