01:18.703 --> 01:22.040
Collection Agency, Kareem speaking.
File number please.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.459
I need the file number, sir.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.004
Please lower your voice,
so I can help you.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.257
I know it's a new fridge,
obviously it's new,

01:31.341 --> 01:32.300
that's why it's being repossessed.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.143
Hear the sirens

01:43.186 --> 01:44.437
See the sirens

01:47.065 --> 01:49.150
Don't want trouble
Better pull over!

01:57.867 --> 02:01.538
Call it Lyd, Lod, or Lydia

02:02.413 --> 02:05.667
I'll give you a couple of minutes
To search in Wikipedia

02:06.751 --> 02:09.254
Time's up
The cops are at the door

02:09.921 --> 02:11.297
The next station is...

02:11.381 --> 02:12.215
Lod.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.132
Hear the sirens

02:59.888 --> 03:03.641
A population of 8500
In a tight ghetto

03:03.725 --> 03:05.894
They built a wall
To divide between

03:06.561 --> 03:10.023
Sign bail or sign up for welfare
I created a third option

03:10.106 --> 03:12.275
Become the first Arab rapper
Fuck you

03:12.358 --> 03:15.695
Don't want no trouble
Better pull over to the side

03:25.747 --> 03:26.664
Give me a puff.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.626
Give it to me, man.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.796
-You ate the whole tray?
-Yeah, it was a small pizza.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.675
-Bless you... Have mercy on yourself.
-It didn't even fill me up.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.510
Hey, there's Tupac!

03:44.015 --> 03:44.849
Hey!

03:45.308 --> 03:46.476
What's up, man?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.436
You know, just making money.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.479
How about you?

03:49.604 --> 03:53.650
Making money for someone else.
Just got off work, I'm walking home.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.609
So take this.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.526
What is it?

03:56.527 --> 03:57.570
For your brother.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.824
-See you later.
-See you.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.534
-Call me, okay?
-No problem.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.431
Give me two from underneath, please.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.187
Let go of me! Hey! Hey!

04:31.521 --> 04:34.065
Motherfucker! Where's the walkie-talkie?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.193
Burn it, George!

04:37.277 --> 04:40.655
-Three police cars and one undercover.
-Watch out!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.128
Police!

04:57.880 --> 04:59.799
Hear the sirens
Burn it, George!

04:59.882 --> 05:01.801
See the sirens
Burn it, George!

05:01.926 --> 05:03.845
What did we do?
Burn it, George!

05:03.970 --> 05:06.347
Don't want no trouble
Better pull over!

05:06.472 --> 05:08.266
Hands up
Burn it, George!

05:08.349 --> 05:10.393
Empty your pockets
Burn it, George!

05:10.476 --> 05:12.395
Spread your legs
Burn it, George!

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
Don't want no trouble
Better pull over!

05:14.814 --> 05:16.274
Hands up
Burn it, George!

05:16.357 --> 05:18.401
Empty your pockets
Burn it, George!

05:18.484 --> 05:20.403
Spread your legs
Burn it, George!

05:20.486 --> 05:22.613
I have no record
You can look it up!

05:50.308 --> 05:51.893
Just wait and see, Yousef.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.399
Did you see our school?

05:58.483 --> 06:02.278
Did you see a library there?
They turned it into a police station

06:02.361 --> 06:04.697
The only light we see is the siren.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.201
Every time I say mic check, record

06:08.284 --> 06:10.745
Cops pull me over to check my record!

06:14.457 --> 06:16.000
Wow, powerful!

06:16.834 --> 06:18.002
Yes, incredible.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.712
Who's that behind you?

06:19.796 --> 06:20.630
Mariam!

06:20.713 --> 06:23.299
Your father sent you to find a doctor

06:23.382 --> 06:25.843
and you brought back a guy from Lyd?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.888
As if you're any better...

06:28.971 --> 06:30.598
-Sweetheart...
-Go away.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.060
Kareem, dinner is ready.

06:35.978 --> 06:36.854
Okay.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.732
You're coming to your
parents' concert tonight, right?

06:39.816 --> 06:44.112
I can't be bothered to face my dad, so.
I'll get back to you later?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.823
Okay, fine.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.157
Bye.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.211
Kareem...

07:00.294 --> 07:02.463
Why are you eating all by yourself?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.132
Bring down some food,

07:04.215 --> 07:06.676
and I'll treat you for a special dessert.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.137
I gotta go.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.555
Sit down.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.140
Finish your dinner.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.224
I'm full.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.225
No, you're not.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.227
Your mother worked hard.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.728
Show some respect, eat.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.814
Is it tuned?

07:25.319 --> 07:28.489
Peace be upon you

07:28.573 --> 07:33.453
The land of my ancestors

07:40.209 --> 07:41.043
Kareem!

07:43.588 --> 07:45.047
Kareem...

07:47.842 --> 07:49.135
Salvation at last.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.679
Man! Sorry.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.225
You kept me hanging.
You know what your problem is?

07:56.392 --> 07:59.854
You act like a gangster,
and your life is full of drama.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.733
But you don't leave the house
without permission from your mama!

08:03.900 --> 08:05.568
What's up?

08:06.235 --> 08:07.153
Where to?

08:07.236 --> 08:08.237
Come on!

08:08.321 --> 08:10.072
We're going to have some fun.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.699
Who's driving? Yousef?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
-All good?
-Just a second.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.995
Everything cool?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.581
I got you a badass Mercedes
to show off.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.167
Fuck your Mercedes!
Why did you bring him?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.044
Why did you bring him, man?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.004
-Should I send him home?
-Yes.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.424
-I can't do that.
-You want trouble from the authorities?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.384
Relax, man. I don't have a car.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.554
How am I supposed
to find a ride at the last minute?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.390
-We're going to have fun.
-It's not my problem!

08:36.474 --> 08:38.392
-What?
-Stop that, come here!

08:42.772 --> 08:44.732
Aren't you late for the concert?

08:46.192 --> 08:49.529
He calls himself a man,
but he doesn't go to college...

08:49.612 --> 08:50.488
That's fine.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.199
He gets fired from all his new jobs.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.700
That's fine too.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.956
He claims to be a musician,
but I've never seen him practice.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.415
That's also fine.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.002
But to hang out
with drug dealers and thugs,

09:05.211 --> 09:06.587
here I draw the line.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.883
Let's go.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.388
Talal is not a dealer.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.060
Give him a week and
he'll open a dealing station...

09:21.143 --> 09:22.645
Come on!
Move faster!

09:23.354 --> 09:25.231
Who's that guy in the Mercedes?

09:26.274 --> 09:28.067
Don't tell me it's the Imam...

09:28.484 --> 09:29.610
What do you know?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.530
Don't be rude to your father.
Talk with respect!

09:32.613 --> 09:33.739
He started it.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.741
Why did you...

09:37.368 --> 09:38.911
Why did you call me, Dad?

09:39.662 --> 09:42.415
Because I'm exhausted
and want you to drive us

09:42.498 --> 09:44.083
back from the concert.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.646
You know you're only
making it worse, right?

10:07.106 --> 10:07.940
I know.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.361
And now, allow me
to invite to the stage...

10:12.778 --> 10:14.405
From Lyd and for Lyd...

10:14.739 --> 10:16.449
Tayseera and Mounir Awad.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.919
Good evening, comrades.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.882
We'll stand strong
and things will get better, right?

10:52.234 --> 10:56.947
Peace be upon you

10:57.031 --> 11:01.786
The land of my ancestors

11:01.869 --> 11:06.540
Where I find pleasure

11:06.624 --> 11:10.628
In my home and song

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Is there another bottle?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.008
We'll get more, don't worry.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.178
-We'll stop at the store...
-Pour me all that's left.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.137
Idiot.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.025
He's got the prettiest girl
in the country.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.195
-But look where he ended up.
-With us in the brothel!

11:37.613 --> 11:38.447
Hey!

11:38.823 --> 11:41.283
Mad respect, bless your words...

11:41.367 --> 11:44.578
But mention my girlfriend again
and I'll fuck your mom!

11:44.787 --> 11:47.581
Isn't that what
the Jewish bitches are for?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.422
Anyone else wants to doubt my talent?

11:54.964 --> 11:55.840
-Talal.
-What?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.675
How much? 200 an hour?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.218
No, it's 150.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.803
Ask your friend for me.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.806
The girl I reserved for you today...
She's hot.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.153
Sergey! What's up?

12:19.113 --> 12:19.947
Sweetie...

12:21.073 --> 12:22.158
What's up?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.251
Go.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.307
Just a second...

12:47.850 --> 12:48.684
One second.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.280
Where are you, love?
Your parents are amazing on stage.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.119
At least I got laid, unlike Kareem.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.287
He got fucked!

13:08.370 --> 13:10.164
Guys, leave Kareem alone.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.294
Because Kareem is a hopeless romantic.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.589
"Look at her text message... Wow!"

13:27.431 --> 13:29.183
What is it, my love?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.852
Tired?

13:33.437 --> 13:34.271
I'm okay.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.643
Kareem.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.980
-What?
-What.

14:18.983 --> 14:19.817
What happened?

14:20.651 --> 14:22.236
My mom is going to live...

14:23.821 --> 14:25.114
My dad died.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.534
Bless his soul.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.167
Where is Hussam?

14:37.418 --> 14:39.795
Not here.
At the funeral home.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.547
Pardon us...

14:47.595 --> 14:49.179
There is no God but Allah.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.349
No slumber can seize him.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.478
His are all things
in the heavens and on earth.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.560
We come from God
and to God we shall return.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.982
Patience is a form of faith
and its reward is great.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.777
Patience is derived from faith.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.906
The Prophet Muhammad says

15:50.407 --> 15:54.244
there is no greater gift than patience.

15:54.453 --> 15:58.082
There is no greater gift...

16:01.251 --> 16:03.504
God have mercy on our dead,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.464
and on our living,

16:06.173 --> 16:08.258
and on our young and old.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.011
God,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.347
do not withhold your blessings.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.516
Prevent us from quarreling.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.446
Say your goodbyes.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.533
Kiss him on the forehead.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.833
I'm sorry, Dad.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.970
God have mercy on your soul, Dad.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.685
Be strong.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.939
May God have mercy on his soul.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.262
Hands in the air

17:35.345 --> 17:37.431
Raise your voice

17:37.514 --> 17:39.141
Shake the walls

17:39.224 --> 17:41.852
Wake up the neighbors

17:41.935 --> 17:43.979
Hands in the air

17:44.063 --> 17:46.315
Raise your voice

17:46.398 --> 17:47.733
Shake the walls

17:47.816 --> 17:49.860
Wake up the neighbors

17:49.943 --> 17:51.445
The bastards are coming.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.698
I hope you're not carrying anything...

17:54.907 --> 17:55.866
Hello.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.826
Where are you going?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.661
I'm not going anywhere...

18:00.162 --> 18:02.498
What are you doing here, if I may ask.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.291
-We live here.
-You live here?

18:04.374 --> 18:06.919
-IDs please.
-I don't have one, I'm a minor.

18:07.002 --> 18:11.131
-Take him to the fence and search him.
-I haven't done anything wrong.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.050
Shut up. Get over to the fence.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.386
Hey! You can't do this to us.
We've done nothing wrong.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.429
Honey...

18:17.554 --> 18:18.555
Do me a favor...

18:18.722 --> 18:21.391
Go to the fence with your hands up.
Right now!

18:21.558 --> 18:24.353
-Are you serious?
-Shut up and get to the fence!

18:24.436 --> 18:25.521
Hands up!

18:28.941 --> 18:31.819
Code 443, Code 443...
There is a disturbance...

18:31.902 --> 18:33.237
Leave them for now...

18:58.887 --> 19:00.931
God, give me strength.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.102
Everything all right?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.270
Fine.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.331
Leave me.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.758
Stop...

19:58.238 --> 19:59.656
Put your arm around me.

20:01.116 --> 20:01.950
Ready?

20:11.501 --> 20:13.337
Don't worry, Mom, it's nothing.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.468
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.678
Don't say that.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.025
Hocus Pocus!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.278
Look, now there are drawings...

20:38.487 --> 20:40.405
Wow, how nice!

20:41.323 --> 20:43.533
-Let's do it again.
-I want to try it.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.327
Hocus Pocus!

20:46.578 --> 20:47.412
Look!

20:47.496 --> 20:49.915
Now the drawings are colored!

20:49.998 --> 20:52.376
Isn't it amazing? Clap your hands!

20:53.460 --> 20:56.588
-You have a big family...
-Do you want some?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.966
But they're not as beautiful as you...

21:00.634 --> 21:01.510
Hello.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.512
My cousins...
Sami and Rasheed.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.389
Nice meeting you.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.224
Amir.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.642
Hello, Amir.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.810
Hussam.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.062
Welcome, Hussam.
Welcome guys.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.647
Are you going to sing?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.232
We hope so.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.400
I don't like rap.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.403
We got sick of it in Brooklyn.
It's nonsense.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.280
Pardon me...

21:22.406 --> 21:23.740
I'll see you later.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.285
I hope you'll enjoy our show anyway.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.619
Kareem, let's go.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.454
Pardon me.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.208
Guys, are you ready?

21:34.334 --> 21:39.339
Put your hands up!

21:40.590 --> 21:42.843
Come on, higher, higher!

21:46.471 --> 21:48.140
Clap with me!

21:50.017 --> 21:52.561
Hands in the air

21:52.644 --> 21:55.105
Raise your voice

21:55.188 --> 21:57.316
Shake the walls

21:57.399 --> 22:00.193
Wake up the neighbors

22:00.277 --> 22:02.654
Hands in the air

22:02.738 --> 22:05.073
Raise your voice

22:05.157 --> 22:07.326
Shake the walls

22:07.409 --> 22:10.203
Wake up the neighbors

22:11.079 --> 22:13.540
I'm not a lawyer, not a doctor

22:13.623 --> 22:15.917
Even a mechanic I'm not

22:16.001 --> 22:17.753
I fly high without feathers

22:17.836 --> 22:20.839
I have crocodile skin

22:20.922 --> 22:23.300
Headphones in class, beats hitting hard

22:23.425 --> 22:25.802
Dictionary in my hands, translating rap

22:25.927 --> 22:29.306
Yo, Teacher, I'm trying to learn English

22:29.389 --> 22:31.892
Please shut up so I can hear the lyrics!

22:31.975 --> 22:37.189
They said I was writing fantasies

22:37.272 --> 22:39.274
But I'm not writing rap

22:39.357 --> 22:41.026
I'm writing future realities

22:41.109 --> 22:43.361
I bring a new style

22:43.445 --> 22:46.448
My pants wide like my imagination

22:46.531 --> 22:48.825
I don't care about love and...

22:48.909 --> 22:51.244
I don't sing about girls

22:51.328 --> 22:52.621
Hands in the air

22:52.704 --> 22:55.123
Raise your voice

22:55.207 --> 22:57.584
Shake the walls

22:57.667 --> 23:00.212
Wake up the neighbors

23:00.295 --> 23:02.672
Hands in the air

23:02.756 --> 23:05.258
Raise your voice

23:05.342 --> 23:07.344
Shake the walls

23:07.427 --> 23:10.347
Wake up the neighbors...

23:11.807 --> 23:12.933
Thank you.

23:13.016 --> 23:16.353
I would like to invite to the stage...

23:17.187 --> 23:20.315
The best singer in the Middle East...

23:22.984 --> 23:26.196
Nah, I think it's time to cut the cake.
Happy birthday.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.749
I'm sick of amateur shows
and birthday parties.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.167
We deserve better.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.753
Even the mosque has
a better sound system.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.214
Talal sells to weed to Jewish guys...

23:44.464 --> 23:47.467
At the Marley Club in Tel Aviv.
People rap there.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.928
Kareem, maybe they'll let us perform?

23:50.137 --> 23:52.764
We sing in Arabic...
They won't understand.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.475
Don't you worry.
With what Talal will sell...

23:55.725 --> 23:57.769
Even Hebrew they won't understand.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.314
Should I call and ask him?

24:01.857 --> 24:04.109
I don't know... Call him.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.361
Call him.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.386
Ladies!

24:33.555 --> 24:34.389
What's up?

24:35.432 --> 24:37.809
Come kiss the hand of your new manager.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.019
How come?

24:39.227 --> 24:40.937
You arranged a performance?

24:41.188 --> 24:43.773
Don't believe it? Trust me!

24:45.775 --> 24:46.776
You bastard!

24:47.694 --> 24:51.198
Don't make me regret this, okay?

24:52.365 --> 24:56.369
-You're afraid we'll embarrass you?
-Maybe.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.080
You're the one who is embarrassing.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.292
My income is on the line. Hear that?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.794
Don't make me regret this.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.964
He's afraid we're going
to embarrass him...

25:12.552 --> 25:13.470
Respect, man.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.513
Now help us clean up...

25:27.025 --> 25:27.984
What's that?

25:28.735 --> 25:29.569
What?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.280
-It's the same one.
-Yeah, the same one.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.615
Tell me something...

25:33.823 --> 25:36.409
Did you buy medicine
with my mom yesterday?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.328
Yeah. Why do you ask?

25:38.411 --> 25:39.996
No reason. How are you?

25:40.413 --> 25:41.581
Fine.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.376
I registered for next semester...

25:45.377 --> 25:48.755
The family is pressuring my mom.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.049
They don't want me living alone...

25:56.638 --> 25:58.348
Just like Michael Jackson.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.558
Yeah, a bit too much.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.563
Try this one on.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.899
So it's a new semester...

26:09.693 --> 26:13.113
And... They want me to get married.

26:15.699 --> 26:20.120
That way I'll be someone else's
responsibility, not theirs.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.330
What do you think?

26:23.915 --> 26:27.836
Honestly? I'm glad I don't have
a sister to be responsible for.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.254
I'm being serious now.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.548
You don't want a problem like me?

26:34.342 --> 26:36.052
Manar, we talked about this.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.891
I have no income, no job, nothing.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.894
If I make it big,
we can live off the music...

26:45.312 --> 26:46.146
Okay?

26:50.442 --> 26:53.361
Do you want to sing
with us tonight at the Marley?

26:53.903 --> 26:54.988
In Hebrew?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.199
In Hebrew, yes.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.411
Go perform for the Jews by yourself.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.246
My love, I didn't mean it...

27:03.330 --> 27:04.748
I was kidding, come.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.292
Kareem. My cousins are here.

27:09.919 --> 27:10.795
So...

27:30.231 --> 27:33.276
Jews, cousins, family...
All the same shit, huh?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.652
Not funny!

27:35.528 --> 27:36.988
Now for real, Kareem.

27:37.072 --> 27:40.658
I can't have my cousins
following me around.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.245
Anyway...

27:44.537 --> 27:46.748
I'll go with you to the club today.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.875
Hey! We can sing that song...

27:49.042 --> 27:51.419
I said I'll come,
I didn't say I'll sing.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.046
Okay, thanks.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.840
Try this one...

27:58.593 --> 27:59.677
Like that...

28:09.396 --> 28:12.482
Everyone put your hands up.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.442
RPG.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.653
67 Carat.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.322
Sing with us.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.282
Everybody sing with us...

28:21.366 --> 28:23.993
Long live the nation of Israel!

28:24.077 --> 28:26.079
Long live the nation of Israel!

28:26.162 --> 28:29.290
Long live the nation of Israel!

28:29.499 --> 28:31.709
You are our family

28:31.960 --> 28:34.003
DJ, hit it

28:34.379 --> 28:36.256
Have no fear, Israel

28:36.339 --> 28:40.260
Your symbol is the lion cub

28:40.343 --> 28:42.804
And when the lion roars

28:42.887 --> 28:44.764
Everyone is fearful

28:44.848 --> 28:47.976
Everyone is fearful

28:49.269 --> 28:51.187
Have no fear, Israel

28:52.147 --> 28:55.859
Your symbol is the lion cub

28:55.942 --> 28:58.403
And when the lion roars

28:58.486 --> 29:00.447
Everyone is fearful

29:00.530 --> 29:03.324
Everyone is fearful

29:10.123 --> 29:11.583
What the fuck, Kareem?

29:12.375 --> 29:13.460
They're cool.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.420
Can't you hear the words?

29:15.503 --> 29:17.547
Put your hands in the air...

29:17.672 --> 29:19.883
Listen to the beat, the phrasing...

29:19.966 --> 29:21.384
Kareem, I'm leaving...

29:21.468 --> 29:22.635
Are you serious?

29:22.719 --> 29:25.889
My nation is my blood, my drug

29:25.972 --> 29:28.099
My mic is like a gun
You can't run

29:28.183 --> 29:29.893
RPG, I am irresistible

29:29.976 --> 29:31.978
Since '48 I am invincible

29:32.061 --> 29:34.814
War is not a game
Don't mess with me

29:34.898 --> 29:36.775
You are my people, my blood

29:36.858 --> 29:38.985
I served in the army to protect you

29:39.152 --> 29:41.488
I fought for you with my bare hands

29:41.571 --> 29:43.656
Terror attacks, going off-track

29:43.740 --> 29:45.533
It's a cursed commandment

29:45.617 --> 29:47.744
We are being lead to the grave

29:49.037 --> 29:50.914
We can't stand it anymore...

29:57.670 --> 30:00.548
Long live the nation of Israel!

30:02.842 --> 30:05.094
Thank you for coming, everyone!

30:05.178 --> 30:07.972
You are our family!
You are our blood!

30:10.517 --> 30:13.019
Wake up...

30:14.354 --> 30:15.897
Get crazy...

30:17.607 --> 30:20.360
Lose your mind...

30:21.528 --> 30:24.572
Wake up...

30:25.490 --> 30:27.283
Here comes the guy from Lod,

30:27.367 --> 30:29.327
who will keep you wanting more...

30:29.410 --> 30:33.122
Kareem!

30:41.297 --> 30:42.131
Hello.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.388
First, a little explanation.

30:48.471 --> 30:51.850
We are going to perform
a song called "Burn it, George."

30:52.141 --> 30:54.102
In Arabic the title is a...

30:54.185 --> 30:55.228
code name.

30:55.311 --> 31:00.066
Lod has one of the biggest
drug markets in the Middle East.

31:00.149 --> 31:03.528
When there's a police raid,
that's how the lookout says...

31:03.611 --> 31:05.071
Burn the evidence.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.449
So when I shout something, you answer...
Burn it, George!

31:08.533 --> 31:09.701
Hussam!

31:14.831 --> 31:16.833
Hear the sirens...
Burn it, George!

31:16.916 --> 31:18.960
See the sirens...
Burn it, George!

31:19.043 --> 31:20.962
What did we do?
Burn it, George!

31:21.045 --> 31:23.381
Don't want no trouble
Better pull over!

31:23.464 --> 31:25.133
Hands up...
Burn it, George!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.468
Empty your pockets...
Burn it, George!

31:27.594 --> 31:29.971
Spread your legs...
Burn it, George!

31:30.054 --> 31:32.432
I have no record, you can look it up!

31:32.557 --> 31:35.935
Call it Lyd, Lod, or Lydia

31:36.227 --> 31:39.522
I'll give you a couple of minutes
to search in Wikipedia

31:39.606 --> 31:43.318
Time's up
The police are at the door

31:43.610 --> 31:45.695
We live next to the train tracks...

31:45.862 --> 31:47.280
300 trains at the door!

31:47.488 --> 31:50.992
The only entrance
Is between passing trains

31:51.117 --> 31:53.036
Ten kids have died already

31:53.202 --> 31:55.455
And there is no one to complain to...

31:55.538 --> 31:58.833
A population of 8500 in a ghetto
Tighter than a pussy

31:58.917 --> 32:02.503
So go to hell before you
Tell me to go to school!

32:03.046 --> 32:04.964
Have you seen our school?

32:05.048 --> 32:06.841
Did you see a library there?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.135
They turned it into a police station

32:09.218 --> 32:10.803
The only light we see

32:10.887 --> 32:11.846
Is the siren

32:11.930 --> 32:16.809
Every time I say "Mic check, Record"
The cops pull me over to check my record!

32:16.893 --> 32:18.937
Hear the sirens...
Burn it, George!

32:19.062 --> 32:21.022
See the sirens...
Burn it, George!

32:21.105 --> 32:22.982
What did we do?
Burn it, George!

32:23.066 --> 32:25.443
I don't want no trouble
Better pull over!

32:25.526 --> 32:27.195
Hands up...
Burn it, George!

32:27.278 --> 32:29.530
Empty your pockets...
Burn it, George!

32:29.614 --> 32:31.074
Spread your legs...
Burn it, George!

32:31.157 --> 32:33.368
I have no record
You can look it up!

32:35.954 --> 32:39.499
What is this joke...
Where did you find him?

32:39.582 --> 32:42.794
-Great show, awesome vibes.
-You enjoyed it?

32:44.003 --> 32:45.838
Kareem is a great stage name.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.757
No, it's my real name.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.343
-Where are you guys really from?
-Lod.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.846
-Which Lod? Jaffa?
-Lod. Near the airport...

32:54.389 --> 32:56.766
-What's your name?
-RPG.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.103
I mean the name on your ID...

33:00.186 --> 33:01.396
R-P-G.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.273
-Seriously?
-Yes.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.567
-Kalashnikov?
-Formerly Kalashnikov...

33:06.651 --> 33:09.195
This is 67 Carat, bro.
Show some respect.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.364
Of course! Great show...

33:13.992 --> 33:17.745
-Did you invite...
-Yes, you're invited to our after-party.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.457
It's gonna get wild and messy...
Do you have another card?

33:21.541 --> 33:23.501
Come, it's at the loft next door.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.712
-Seriously, bro?
-I'm serious.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.675
Beer?

33:31.467 --> 33:32.844
Two beers, please.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.805
Shots on the house. Whiskey?

33:35.888 --> 33:37.807
You were amazing.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.143
Not only a concert, but also whiskey!

33:41.060 --> 33:42.061
Excuse me?

33:42.645 --> 33:43.604
Cheers!

33:44.731 --> 33:48.651
I'm a researcher at the morning TV show.
Or do you not know it?

33:48.735 --> 33:54.532
You look like night owls,
like you love to party and wake up late.

33:56.075 --> 33:56.951
I'm Tali.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.661
It's a pleasure.
I'm Kareem.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.746
I'm Amir.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.582
Can I have your phone number, Kareem?

34:03.207 --> 34:05.710
Unless you don't want to be on our show.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.628
No, I didn't say that.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.089
Great. Can I have your number?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.967
I have two friends with me.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.678
They can see you on TV.
We want only you.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.181
-Why?
-Because I like you.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.268
-Is this your band?
-Yes.

34:22.685 --> 34:26.147
-Are you an Israeli Arab rapper?
-Kind of...

34:26.230 --> 34:28.775
Come, drink.
It's on the house, right?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.627
-What are you?
-What?

34:47.710 --> 34:49.420
-Are you shy?
-No...

34:49.504 --> 34:51.964
-Are you gay?
-No way, you're gay.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.300
-Are you interested?
-In what?

34:54.383 --> 34:55.468
In me.

34:59.764 --> 35:03.267
Yes, somehow...

35:04.685 --> 35:07.355
You're the prettiest here.
The sexiest.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.607
You are my sunrise...

35:09.690 --> 35:10.983
My moon...

35:12.193 --> 35:13.653
But I have a girlfriend.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.073
You're weird.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.876
I have a friend who is stationed
at Qalandia checkpoint.

36:10.084 --> 36:13.796
They have to check everyone
going in and out of the checkpoint.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.591
What can he do?
An order is an order.

36:17.383 --> 36:21.262
Anyone causing problems,
gets pulled to the side.

36:22.221 --> 36:25.766
Once... there was this old
Palestinian man with his grandson.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.603
A real Palestinian,
not like you.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.647
The real deal,
from the West Bank.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.276
It was a hot day. A bit boring.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.447
So the guys wanted to
pass the time, play a little game.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.866
They asked the old man to run

36:41.949 --> 36:45.203
from where he stood
to the guard tower in 30 seconds.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.915
It's not a problem. A very easy task.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.334
He did it in 45 seconds.

36:52.877 --> 36:56.714
So they asked him to do it again,
but to try harder.

36:57.298 --> 37:01.052
And he looked fit.
A construction worker or something.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.846
But no! He's not willing to cooperate.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.724
He sits on the ground
and doesn't want to move.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.476
As if he was protesting.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.230
My friend was nice to him,
he asked him to stand up.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.691
Because protesting
is not a good thing to do.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.818
It's not a good thing.

37:18.527 --> 37:21.364
Suddenly his grandson
becomes weirdly emotional,

37:21.447 --> 37:24.200
and decides to attack
my friend from behind.

37:25.534 --> 37:28.537
So they had to teach
the son of a bitch a lesson.

37:29.497 --> 37:33.209
And now he is rotting in jail
on charge of assaulting a soldier.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.544
And I think to myself...
What a shame.

37:36.462 --> 37:41.259
All the old man had to do
was stand on his feet.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.053
Really...

37:47.223 --> 37:51.769
Cheers. Loosen up.
Welcome to the Middle East, my brother.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.730
To art, yes?

37:55.898 --> 37:58.442
Did you see the one
that I was dancing with?

37:58.943 --> 38:02.196
If you would have let me,
I could have taken her home.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.658
You ruined it. You wanted to leave.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.911
But you know what?
Bros before hos!

38:08.995 --> 38:12.415
I wouldn't sell my bros
for all the pussies in the world.

38:16.002 --> 38:20.423
Just so you know...
The only pussies at this party were us.

38:21.590 --> 38:22.925
Take it easy, Talal.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.430
What is that over there?

38:28.097 --> 38:29.932
Motherfuckers!

38:30.016 --> 38:32.476
-An eviction order?
-Yeah.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.604
Talal, what is it,
an invitation to another party?

38:35.688 --> 38:36.689
Shut up!

38:36.772 --> 38:38.316
Another eviction order?

38:38.399 --> 38:39.317
Yes.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.152
Those motherfuckers...

38:41.235 --> 38:43.112
-Easy.
-Open the door.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.461
Move the bag out of the way.

38:58.878 --> 39:02.340
Those motherfuckers...
Fuck their democracy!

39:06.052 --> 39:07.553
Fuck those assholes...

39:08.763 --> 39:10.556
Get out, you.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.641
Lower your voice!
They're sleeping!

39:12.725 --> 39:13.934
Move.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.607
Go.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.245
-Come on.
-We should put Amir with the goats.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.165
Every time he drinks,
we need to babysit him.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.750
Lower your voice!

39:53.224 --> 39:55.559
"The Museum of Coexistence"

39:55.643 --> 39:59.313
-Coexistence, eh?
-Sit down. Don't let it bother you.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.691
All I want is a joint to blow my mind.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.698
I don't care anymore.
Fuck it.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.076
By the time
they build their museum,

40:12.159 --> 40:15.454
I'll be coexisting with
a Romanian chick. Blue eyes...

40:15.538 --> 40:19.250
Smoking weed,
making babies in the snow.

40:19.458 --> 40:23.003
I swear. In the middle of the snow.

40:23.796 --> 40:24.797
That's a 9 mm.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.466
Fuck, you're so stupid. It's fireworks.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.135
I swear it's a 9 mm.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.387
I assure you that it's fireworks.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.309
I told you so. Fuck off bitch!

40:37.393 --> 40:39.854
It's actually the sound of the slap
that chick gave me.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.856
Go to sleep already! Dumbass.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.942
Roll us a joint and let us smoke.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.777
Let the frustration go.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.070
Yes.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.121
Yo.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.206
What do you want?

41:00.207 --> 41:01.208
Manar!

41:03.252 --> 41:06.380
What is it Kareem?
Did you have fun yesterday?

41:06.547 --> 41:08.841
They apologized for '67 and for '48...

41:08.924 --> 41:11.302
They also gave us the right of return.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.430
You should've been there.
It was a historic moment.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.890
It's not funny.

41:16.223 --> 41:19.685
Manar...
You're the one who ditched me.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.313
I tried to follow you.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.857
Sorry, my love. I'm really sorry.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.318
Talal! Good morning.
Come eat breakfast.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.114
Give it to me, I'll take it.

41:41.373 --> 41:42.917
We're missing a hookah.

41:45.085 --> 41:48.297
Put that away, my dad's here.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.846
-The lawyer will be here soon.
-Okay.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.806
-Get ready.
-No problem.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.767
Good morning, Abu Abdullah.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.019
Good morning, guys. Welcome.

42:07.107 --> 42:11.111
My only work is managing you guys,
and it's not even an actual job.

42:11.278 --> 42:13.989
You think it's funny?
It's not real work.

42:14.406 --> 42:19.620
How can you cut me a percent of no profit?
How much is twenty percent of zero?

42:20.329 --> 42:21.997
Better than nothing.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.675
-Hello.
-Hello, welcome.

42:32.758 --> 42:35.970
-I'm the lawyer from Adala organization.
-Abu Abdullah.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.721
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

42:39.431 --> 42:40.266
Talal!

42:41.559 --> 42:42.393
Talal!

42:43.102 --> 42:43.978
What?

42:44.061 --> 42:45.563
The lawyer is here.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.480
Coming.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.108
I promise to help you
to resolve this case.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.861
Talal, give her the money, son.

43:34.111 --> 43:37.740
No, not now. We'll take only what
is needed for the appeal.

43:38.032 --> 43:42.244
Look, I'm going to be frank with you.
The situation is not looking good.

43:42.328 --> 43:47.291
The evidence that the state has provided,
according to its own laws, is very strong.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.085
Thank you.

43:52.129 --> 43:56.508
If you flee the country, the state
considers your house abandoned property,

43:56.592 --> 43:59.261
and it sells it
to the Jewish National Fund.

43:59.345 --> 44:01.388
Why to the Jewish National Fund?

44:01.472 --> 44:04.433
Because it sells and rents
only to Jews...

44:05.142 --> 44:08.103
They are claiming that
you fled to Jordan in 1948?

44:08.187 --> 44:10.397
-We didn't flee, they kicked us out!
-I know.

44:10.731 --> 44:14.276
There was a massacre
in the Dahmash mosque, next to our home,

44:14.360 --> 44:16.195
they told us that we are next.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.657
-That's when you fled to Jordan?
-It was our only option.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.951
-How did you manage to return?
-My family stayed there.

44:23.035 --> 44:27.122
I was the youngest boy. I snuck back
here to take care of the goats.

44:28.332 --> 44:32.127
According to the state of Israel,
your presence here is illegal.

44:32.211 --> 44:34.505
-A present absentee.
-What do you mean?

44:34.838 --> 44:38.175
How can I be absent
when I'm right here in my own home?

44:39.218 --> 44:42.471
Just a moment.
You said that the goats stayed here?

44:42.554 --> 44:44.848
Yes. They are here to this day.

44:48.268 --> 44:51.021
The goats might be
our last chance to win this.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.941
When I came back here,
everything was destroyed,

44:54.024 --> 44:55.567
except for the big house.

44:55.984 --> 44:57.778
They put a fence around it.

44:57.861 --> 45:01.073
With signs in Arabic,
Hebrew, and English that said,

45:01.615 --> 45:02.950
"Archaeological Site."

45:04.326 --> 45:06.370
There was an opening in the fence.

45:06.954 --> 45:07.871
I got in.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.833
I found the goats inside the house.

45:12.167 --> 45:15.129
I started rebuilding in the yard...
60 years ago.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.882
I've been here for over 60 years.
I didn't arrive yesterday.

45:19.341 --> 45:20.676
But two years ago,

45:21.510 --> 45:23.887
they told us that they want the house.

45:24.221 --> 45:27.015
In order to build
a Museum of Coexistence.

45:27.766 --> 45:32.020
To show that there is co-existence
between Jews and Arabs,

45:32.104 --> 45:36.316
Ethiopians and Russians,
Bedouins and whoever else.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.946
That is why I have to evacuate
the house for demolition.

45:41.321 --> 45:42.448
This house is mine.

45:43.490 --> 45:45.409
I have the papers to prove it.

45:45.617 --> 45:47.911
They laughed... They said to me,

45:48.579 --> 45:51.707
"Maybe it belongs to the goats,
but it's not yours."

45:54.251 --> 45:56.670
-Hopefully it all works out.
-I hope so.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.134
It's crucial to organize
demonstrations for support.

46:49.556 --> 46:51.475
Mom, did you take anything?

46:54.478 --> 46:55.312
God...

46:56.104 --> 46:58.607
Those who are proud
will not be humiliated.

46:58.690 --> 47:01.235
Those who are guided will not go astray.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.111
God...

47:28.595 --> 47:31.765
Do you know
where the big boss is?

47:31.848 --> 47:33.850
Can you tell him
that I'll be late tomorrow?

47:33.934 --> 47:34.768
Sure.

47:34.851 --> 47:37.062
-Want to know why?
-Not really.

47:37.145 --> 47:39.481
-It's actually a good reason.
-Really?

47:39.565 --> 47:40.607
Good luck.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.150
-Bye.
-Bye.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.736
And now we will move to Kareem Avid--

47:44.987 --> 47:45.946
Awad.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.198
Sorry, it's Awad.

47:48.490 --> 47:50.617
The first Israeli Arab rapper...

47:54.371 --> 47:55.998
What a celebrity!

47:56.915 --> 48:01.086
My songs are not political,
they just describe the place I come from.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.964
It's like he's been
doing this his whole life.

48:04.172 --> 48:08.635
You come from Lod, which ironically,
is a city most Israelis don't know.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.304
Why do you think that is?

48:10.387 --> 48:13.098
Lyd is a tough place,
especially on our side.

48:13.181 --> 48:15.976
I'm talking about poverty,
neglected schools,

48:16.184 --> 48:19.354
about settlers,
police brutality towards us.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.689
Police corruption...

48:20.772 --> 48:23.442
We live 15 kilometers from fucking...

48:24.276 --> 48:26.361
Sorry, I can say "fucking," right?

48:26.945 --> 48:28.030
Funny guy.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.698
I'm not trying to be funny.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.951
I'm trying to say is that
you don't know we exist.

48:33.285 --> 48:35.329
You said you're not political.

48:35.579 --> 48:36.663
I'm not political.

48:36.830 --> 48:38.874
But does it make sense to you

48:38.999 --> 48:43.545
that to build a Museum of Coexistence
they have to demolish my friend's home?

48:43.629 --> 48:44.963
I swear he's the man!

48:45.047 --> 48:49.134
He shouldn't have mentioned the house.
It will open the door for evil.

48:54.222 --> 48:58.685
I couldn't help myself.
Every other word was "fucking".

48:59.728 --> 49:02.356
-Manar, don't give me that look.
-What look?

49:02.439 --> 49:03.899
TV made me sexy.

49:03.982 --> 49:07.486
-I liked what you did.
-Thanks, Fayza, sweetie.

49:08.111 --> 49:11.239
-I'm coming to the party tonight.
-You won't run away?

49:11.823 --> 49:13.241
I'll tell you if I do.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.246
Push it!

49:18.997 --> 49:19.831
Come on.

49:28.215 --> 49:31.134
Mom, you have to come to our show tonight.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.097
We are late, let's move.

49:35.972 --> 49:37.391
I'll take her.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.945
Where the heck are we?
A Jewish family's house?

49:51.363 --> 49:53.824
-Welcome.
-Hi, how are you?

49:54.074 --> 49:56.660
-No need.
-Welcome. Please come in.

49:56.743 --> 49:57.703
Let's go inside.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.289
Boys, wait for me outside.

50:06.837 --> 50:10.215
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,

50:13.301 --> 50:16.054
I bear witness that
there is no God but Allah,

50:16.138 --> 50:18.682
and that Muhammad is his messenger.

50:18.765 --> 50:20.308
In the name of Allah

50:25.939 --> 50:28.233
Seek refuge with the Lord of mankind,

50:28.316 --> 50:30.986
The Creator of mankind,
The God of mankind...

50:55.385 --> 50:57.721
My mom totally lost it.

51:00.932 --> 51:03.518
I don't know, Kareem,
I was inside there,

51:04.478 --> 51:07.189
and I saw your mom
do something incredible.

51:08.732 --> 51:09.733
Come on.

51:37.344 --> 51:40.680
Repeat after me!

51:48.021 --> 51:49.856
Kareem, Kareem!

51:52.025 --> 51:55.487
The people want you!

51:55.695 --> 51:57.531
Kareem!
Kareem!

51:57.614 --> 51:59.074
Kareem!
Kareem!

51:59.157 --> 52:00.909
Kareem!
Kareem!

52:01.034 --> 52:02.536
Kareem!
Kareem!

52:03.370 --> 52:08.667
Marley, are you ready?

52:08.750 --> 52:11.628
Humus, salad, fries on the side

52:11.711 --> 52:14.631
You like to eat at our restaurants

52:14.714 --> 52:18.134
But when you see too many of us

52:18.301 --> 52:21.388
Coexistence turns into
A demographic threat

52:22.222 --> 52:24.850
I am not political
I am not political

52:25.433 --> 52:26.768
I am not political

52:28.687 --> 52:31.481
I am not political
I am not political

52:31.690 --> 52:33.233
I am not political

52:37.696 --> 52:40.574
Barbarian Arabs
Indian Arabs

52:41.241 --> 52:42.450
Stinking Arabs

52:45.579 --> 52:47.622
-Look at his girl.
-The one in black?

52:47.706 --> 52:50.584
That bitch?
I thought she was Jewish.

52:51.251 --> 52:53.461
I sing in Arabic to fight you, racism

52:53.545 --> 52:56.923
But you don't play Arabic on your radio

52:57.257 --> 52:58.842
What is he singing about?

52:59.885 --> 53:01.636
What, you don't speak Hebrew?

53:02.888 --> 53:05.390
You know, you don't look like an Arab.

53:05.473 --> 53:07.934
You look like a girl who sucks Arab dick.

53:08.476 --> 53:09.769
Hey! Stop!

53:13.440 --> 53:14.858
Darling, come up here.

53:36.796 --> 53:37.839
Manar!

53:46.723 --> 53:51.770
I have no place

53:52.270 --> 53:57.442
I have no land

53:58.360 --> 54:03.949
I have no country

54:05.450 --> 54:11.247
I light fire with my fingers

54:11.748 --> 54:17.420
I sing to you from my heart

54:18.338 --> 54:22.634
The strings of my heart cry out

54:24.552 --> 54:29.265
I was born in Palestine

54:29.599 --> 54:32.185
I was born in Palestine...

54:33.395 --> 54:35.438
Respect.
My honest respect.

54:35.522 --> 54:37.816
But I want to remind you of one thing.

54:37.899 --> 54:41.277
These guys can go
to Mumbai, to Dubai

54:41.361 --> 54:43.154
to Iran, to Japan.

54:43.238 --> 54:44.823
This here belongs to us!

54:44.906 --> 54:48.118
This is Israel.
This is for Jews.

54:48.201 --> 54:50.787
This is Tel Aviv.
This is ours!

54:50.870 --> 54:53.873
Look at what she's wearing,
look at her necklace...

54:53.957 --> 54:57.210
This is not the Israeli flag,
this is the Palestinian...

55:25.655 --> 55:26.990
What is this tape...

55:27.073 --> 55:28.033
Hold on...

55:28.116 --> 55:29.409
Enough, it's good.

55:30.910 --> 55:33.872
-I'll wrap it for you every day.
-My love.

55:35.415 --> 55:36.958
You were amazing today.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.130
That much?

55:42.338 --> 55:43.965
Maybe I was exaggerating...

55:44.049 --> 55:45.675
Let's exaggerate more...

55:59.022 --> 55:59.856
Why?

56:00.982 --> 56:02.692
Because you're all talk.

56:05.862 --> 56:07.947
I crossed your line.

56:08.031 --> 56:08.990
A little bit.

56:11.910 --> 56:15.830
You have a Che Guevara poster,
you talk about revolution...

56:15.914 --> 56:17.916
Yet you won't cross this line.

56:17.999 --> 56:19.250
It hurts me.

56:20.043 --> 56:22.003
It hurts a little bit. Please.

56:22.712 --> 56:25.632
I'm going to make tea.

56:27.467 --> 56:29.511
So tea is better than sex?

56:30.470 --> 56:31.846
Do you promise me that?

57:22.147 --> 57:23.690
Why be an asshole?

57:36.119 --> 57:37.245
Who is it?

57:41.749 --> 57:42.625
Hello.

57:43.334 --> 57:44.669
Is your mother here?

57:56.556 --> 57:59.976
You we worship,
from You we ask for help.

58:00.059 --> 58:03.188
Guide us in the right path,
the path of the blessed,

58:03.354 --> 58:06.024
not the path of the misguided.
Amen.

58:07.275 --> 58:10.487
If you come back again,
I might be able to help you.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.171
You have enemies.

58:29.297 --> 58:31.216
There are people who hate you.

58:31.299 --> 58:32.717
Who?

58:33.551 --> 58:34.677
People.

58:35.887 --> 58:38.890
You did something to them.

58:39.849 --> 58:43.061
-They are coming after you.
-They put a spell on you.

58:43.144 --> 58:46.981
This cough is the work of a demon.
The doctors don't understand.

59:06.584 --> 59:08.503
There is darkness inside of you!

59:08.920 --> 59:11.422
You have to come back,
so I can help you.

59:14.759 --> 59:16.719
It's my duty to help all people.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.763
I don't believe in this nonsense.

59:18.846 --> 59:22.058
Believe it or don't.
It's your choice.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.354
You really asked him if he has enemies?
Do you know who he is?

59:26.437 --> 59:28.856
A human being.
Just like the rest of us.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.946
Remember what Dad
used to say about him?

59:35.405 --> 59:37.115
How he told me to stay away?

59:37.198 --> 59:39.117
Remember how you never listened?

59:39.200 --> 59:40.702
I never listened to Dad?

59:41.286 --> 59:42.537
Mom, I listened.

59:42.620 --> 59:45.456
You're the one who
brought him into our home.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.793
I talk to your dad everyday.
And he agrees.

59:49.377 --> 59:50.628
Here we go again.

59:51.671 --> 59:52.714
Listen...

59:52.797 --> 59:54.340
Do you even hear yourself?

59:54.632 --> 59:56.467
You are helping a drug dealer.

59:56.551 --> 1:00:00.263
Help? I thought you
didn't believe in this nonsense.

1:00:00.722 --> 1:00:01.556
Listen to me.

1:00:02.265 --> 1:00:04.559
You see angels.
You hallucinate.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:05.893
Do what you want.

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:08.855
But Yousef will not enter this house.
Period!

1:00:09.355 --> 1:00:10.189
Kareem!

1:00:14.569 --> 1:00:16.863
They're demolishing Talal's house!

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:19.282
Run!

1:00:22.285 --> 1:00:25.913
We have to get inside!
It's our friend's house!

1:00:27.915 --> 1:00:30.001
Leave me alone!

1:00:44.599 --> 1:00:46.684
I left something important inside.
I need it.

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:50.396
-You had enough time.
-I wasn't here, good sir, I was at work.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.649
Have mercy on the pigeons.

1:00:52.732 --> 1:00:55.193
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:58.154
Fine!

1:00:58.821 --> 1:01:00.198
Give us a second.

1:01:00.281 --> 1:01:01.949
Just a second!

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:03.034
Just let it go.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:05.578
Yousef will never let it go!

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:09.457
Officer, it will only take a second.

1:01:51.499 --> 1:01:53.626
Down with this criminal government!

1:01:53.710 --> 1:01:55.586
Kareem!
Take this.

1:01:58.339 --> 1:02:00.258
Pull!

1:02:01.175 --> 1:02:03.052
One, two...

1:02:08.641 --> 1:02:09.767
Rubber bullets!

1:02:13.646 --> 1:02:14.731
Down with...

1:02:17.108 --> 1:02:18.985
My leg, you son of a bitch!

1:02:21.446 --> 1:02:22.488
My leg!

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:25.074
Hussam!

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.798
I hope Talal's family is all right.

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:13.933
Hello.

1:04:16.394 --> 1:04:17.687
How are you, dear?

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:19.564
Thank God you are safe.

1:04:21.399 --> 1:04:23.776
-Mariam! Bye, dear.
-Bye.

1:04:26.112 --> 1:04:29.949
-Where did they shoot you, son?
-Here, nothing serious.

1:04:31.284 --> 1:04:33.661
They wanted names of activists

1:04:33.744 --> 1:04:37.248
who were in the demonstration
and who organized it.

1:04:37.915 --> 1:04:43.212
They threatened to hurt my family,
to put me in jail again.

1:04:43.588 --> 1:04:46.173
I told them that I'm familiar
with the law.

1:04:46.257 --> 1:04:49.135
They can't jail me
for more than one night.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.054
Okay, then...

1:04:53.639 --> 1:04:54.807
Shall we go?

1:04:57.351 --> 1:04:58.769
Take care of yourself.

1:05:04.525 --> 1:05:06.193
Another day in paradise.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.154
Welcome to the club, my love.

1:05:11.449 --> 1:05:12.617
Kareem, my arm...

1:05:12.783 --> 1:05:15.161
-What?
-It still hurts.

1:05:16.704 --> 1:05:19.290
I'm sorry.
I was worried about you.

1:05:20.166 --> 1:05:21.000
Really?

1:05:25.379 --> 1:05:26.839
I want you in my life.

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:30.676
What's up?

1:05:31.552 --> 1:05:34.096
Should I build you a room in there?

1:05:34.347 --> 1:05:35.806
Come with me, let's go.

1:05:36.223 --> 1:05:37.975
-Where to?
-It's a surprise.

1:05:38.059 --> 1:05:38.893
What surprise?

1:05:38.976 --> 1:05:40.061
A surprise.

1:06:00.331 --> 1:06:01.999
Take a look, man.

1:06:03.876 --> 1:06:04.877
Check this out.

1:06:05.169 --> 1:06:07.046
Hey, Manar
Hey, Hussam

1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:11.592
You defeated your jailer

1:06:12.843 --> 1:06:14.637
Hey, Manar
Hey, Hussam

1:06:16.347 --> 1:06:18.015
You defeated your jailer

1:06:25.606 --> 1:06:30.486
Peace be upon you

1:06:30.569 --> 1:06:35.408
The land of my ancestors

1:06:36.033 --> 1:06:41.539
Where I find pleasure

1:06:41.622 --> 1:06:46.836
In my home and song

1:06:48.045 --> 1:06:50.047
Dad, are there speakers up there?

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:52.717
I need to have a word with you

1:06:53.551 --> 1:06:55.428
Dad, is rap allowed up there?

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:58.639
I want to sing for you
How much I miss you

1:06:58.723 --> 1:07:01.434
I apologize
I understood you too late

1:07:01.517 --> 1:07:05.354
You knew me as a child
But I never knew you as a man

1:07:05.438 --> 1:07:07.982
I asked my brother to sit between us

1:07:08.274 --> 1:07:10.735
So that I wouldn't have to talk to you

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:13.404
You did the impossible, you taught me...

1:07:13.487 --> 1:07:17.825
So I would not grow up like you
I did the impossible, I didn't listen...

1:07:17.992 --> 1:07:19.994
I was afraid of becoming you

1:07:20.077 --> 1:07:20.911
Talal...

1:07:20.995 --> 1:07:22.955
Amir is usually the funny one...

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:25.583
But today Amir is learning
to cry with you.

1:07:26.292 --> 1:07:27.460
Thank you.

1:07:27.793 --> 1:07:30.713
Talal, buddy...
I realized something.

1:07:30.796 --> 1:07:33.299
A weapon without culture...

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:36.010
It can only destroy us.

1:07:36.677 --> 1:07:39.847
But with this weapon...
We will build.

1:07:40.431 --> 1:07:41.265
Talal.

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:44.643
My father, God rest his soul.

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:48.439
He always talked about
his childhood in this land.

1:07:48.522 --> 1:07:50.441
The memories he passed on to me

1:07:50.524 --> 1:07:54.695
are stronger than the history
that they are trying to rewrite.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:59.366
Dad... Mom...
God bless you.

1:07:59.533 --> 1:08:01.077
I'm sorry for everything.

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:02.828
I promise I'll change.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:05.748
I'm going to start studying

1:08:05.831 --> 1:08:07.541
and I'll rebuild our house.

1:08:08.751 --> 1:08:14.173
Peace be upon you

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:19.053
The land of my ancestors

1:08:19.637 --> 1:08:25.017
Where I find pleasure

1:08:25.101 --> 1:08:30.314
In my home and song...

1:08:34.193 --> 1:08:37.029
Was Mom in the audience today?

1:08:37.113 --> 1:08:38.364
No, I didn't see her.

1:08:41.367 --> 1:08:42.618
Did you remind her?

1:08:43.911 --> 1:08:46.330
You know how it is...
I always tell her.

1:08:46.413 --> 1:08:48.833
I offer to take her and bring her back.

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:51.252
Her friends also offer.

1:08:51.335 --> 1:08:53.796
She doesn't want to come.

1:08:56.340 --> 1:08:59.176
I prefer a Communist Mom to a healer.

1:09:00.261 --> 1:09:03.931
Whoever pours the tea
Make it sweeter

1:09:04.265 --> 1:09:05.641
You know something?

1:09:05.724 --> 1:09:07.393
People are really empowering us.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.145
Last night, for example.

1:09:09.395 --> 1:09:11.856
Despite all the crap we suffered,

1:09:11.939 --> 1:09:14.316
I came out energized.

1:09:15.901 --> 1:09:17.695
I liked your beat last night.

1:09:17.778 --> 1:09:18.696
You liked it?

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:22.992
It shook the whole stage.

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:27.079
Damn. I'll be right back.

1:09:32.501 --> 1:09:35.921
Things will get better, right?
The house will be rebuilt.

1:09:36.005 --> 1:09:37.256
Everything is gone.

1:09:37.464 --> 1:09:40.384
Enough... Don't worry...
It will be all right.

1:09:40.551 --> 1:09:42.636
I'm telling you everything is gone.

1:09:42.928 --> 1:09:44.096
Where are my drugs?

1:09:44.847 --> 1:09:47.558
They demolished the house.
It was all inside.

1:09:47.725 --> 1:09:49.435
I searched.
I didn't find it.

1:09:56.692 --> 1:09:58.027
It's not my problem.

1:09:58.736 --> 1:10:01.322
There were more than
a hundred cops here.

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:03.741
All the drugs were inside.

1:10:04.283 --> 1:10:05.618
I looked everywhere.

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:08.746
I'll say it again.
It's not my problem.

1:10:08.829 --> 1:10:11.415
I gave you something to guard.

1:10:11.498 --> 1:10:13.417
If you don't return it, I'll...

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:15.920
Is this a threat?
Are you threatening me?

1:10:16.337 --> 1:10:17.213
Talal.

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:19.673
Talal, return what's mine.

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:21.675
Or what?

1:10:21.759 --> 1:10:23.260
-Or what?
-Hey, asshole!

1:10:23.469 --> 1:10:25.721
Hey, asshole!
Stop it with the games.

1:10:25.804 --> 1:10:28.515
Give me money or I'll fucking...

1:10:30.768 --> 1:10:31.727
You shit!

1:10:37.483 --> 1:10:39.235
You boys think you're men?

1:10:39.318 --> 1:10:41.654
Do what you want. You'll get nothing!

1:10:42.738 --> 1:10:44.615
I'll see you around, asshole!

1:10:45.532 --> 1:10:48.410
They just demolished his house.

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.413
You know what he's capable of.

1:10:52.414 --> 1:10:54.625
Yousef, come back. We'll resolve it.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:55.626
Yousef...

1:11:01.298 --> 1:11:03.259
Come with me

1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:07.721
Follow me, we'll go far away

1:11:10.182 --> 1:11:11.725
Your brother is in prison.

1:11:13.102 --> 1:11:15.104
And you caused me some trouble.

1:11:18.607 --> 1:11:22.111
But I was never
as proud of you as I am today.

1:11:22.194 --> 1:11:23.362
Bless you, father.

1:11:23.445 --> 1:11:24.446
Bless you, son.

1:11:26.156 --> 1:11:29.285
I'm dying to get out of this place.

1:11:29.952 --> 1:11:30.786
Really?

1:11:31.954 --> 1:11:33.247
Where will you go?

1:11:33.497 --> 1:11:35.374
Chernobyl. I don't know.

1:11:39.295 --> 1:11:40.421
I'm leaving too.

1:11:41.213 --> 1:11:43.215
I'm not even going to look back.

1:11:43.757 --> 1:11:44.758
Where to, son?

1:11:45.634 --> 1:11:47.344
Blondes...
Snow...

1:11:47.511 --> 1:11:48.595
No headache!

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:53.100
I have to take a leak.

1:11:53.350 --> 1:11:54.810
I'll be right back.

1:11:56.395 --> 1:11:57.521
Take Amir with you.

1:11:57.604 --> 1:11:58.480
No way.

1:11:58.564 --> 1:12:00.274
I have enough of a headache.

1:12:00.691 --> 1:12:02.860
Thank you for coming, everyone.

1:12:03.861 --> 1:12:06.322
Thank you for organizing this evening.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:07.740
You're welcome.

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:37.311
God is great.

1:12:40.606 --> 1:12:42.149
God is great.

1:12:45.110 --> 1:12:46.612
God is great.

1:12:49.573 --> 1:12:53.118
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God.

1:13:01.251 --> 1:13:06.715
Peace be upon you

1:13:06.799 --> 1:13:11.678
The land of my ancestors

1:13:12.346 --> 1:13:17.518
Where I find pleasure

1:13:17.726 --> 1:13:22.648
In my home and song

1:13:23.148 --> 1:13:28.278
Peace be upon you

1:13:28.612 --> 1:13:33.742
The land of my ancestors

1:13:34.201 --> 1:13:39.456
Where I find pleasure

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:44.628
In my home and song

1:13:45.003 --> 1:13:49.258
In my home and song

1:13:49.341 --> 1:13:51.093
Are there speakers up there?

1:13:51.176 --> 1:13:56.306
In my home and song

1:13:57.099 --> 1:13:58.851
Is there anything up there?

1:13:58.934 --> 1:14:01.645
We'll rent an X5
Like in a wedding procession

1:14:01.728 --> 1:14:03.689
Everyone will be proud of you

1:14:04.022 --> 1:14:06.108
Wear a suit, fix your tie

1:14:06.191 --> 1:14:07.151
Forget the pain

1:14:07.317 --> 1:14:09.945
We'll dance around you
In the blood wedding

1:14:10.154 --> 1:14:12.865
My friend, the groom...

1:14:13.532 --> 1:14:15.784
Why did you leave me all by myself?

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:18.078
Instead of tears of joy

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:21.039
I'm crying tears of sadness

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:23.542
What will I write on your wedding card?

1:14:23.625 --> 1:14:25.919
When the ink has turned to blood?

1:14:26.003 --> 1:14:27.838
Damn this land
Damn Junction '48

1:14:28.046 --> 1:14:30.632
I wrote you
It was a 9 mm. Congratulations

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:33.844
Peace be upon you

1:14:34.219 --> 1:14:39.433
The land of my ancestors

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.980
Where I find pleasure

1:14:45.063 --> 1:14:50.903
In my home and song

1:14:50.986 --> 1:14:55.824
Peace be upon you

1:14:55.908 --> 1:15:01.371
The land of my ancestors

1:15:01.455 --> 1:15:06.877
Where I find pleasure

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:12.132
In my home and song

1:15:12.216 --> 1:15:17.221
In my home and song

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:24.269
In my home and song

1:15:44.289 --> 1:15:45.415
My love...

1:15:50.128 --> 1:15:51.713
God bless him, my love.

1:15:52.005 --> 1:15:54.174
Yousef, that son of a bitch...

1:15:55.801 --> 1:15:58.387
What's important
is that you are all right.

1:15:59.930 --> 1:16:02.182
Let's go upstairs and calm down.

1:16:02.266 --> 1:16:03.976
Okay.
Let's go upstairs.

1:16:07.646 --> 1:16:09.773
You need to keep it together, okay?

1:16:11.233 --> 1:16:15.195
There is always this thing
pulling me down.

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:17.906
I know how much you loved him.

1:16:22.035 --> 1:16:24.580
But you need to continue singing,
for him.

1:16:31.295 --> 1:16:32.754
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:34.464
Your votes please.

1:16:34.548 --> 1:16:35.757
Number one...

1:16:37.134 --> 1:16:38.510
-How's this?
-No.

1:16:39.011 --> 1:16:40.053
No?

1:16:41.763 --> 1:16:45.976
Bollywood, no.
Next!

1:16:48.687 --> 1:16:50.814
-Number three.
-This one is pretty.

1:16:51.523 --> 1:16:53.483
Bring it over here. Congrats.

1:16:53.567 --> 1:16:55.027
We made a good choice.

1:16:56.653 --> 1:16:57.487
You like it?

1:17:02.367 --> 1:17:04.494
-Thank you, man.
-Cool one, right?

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.288
You nailed it!

1:17:08.999 --> 1:17:11.251
Okay, we have the poster.

1:17:11.418 --> 1:17:12.252
And now...

1:17:12.711 --> 1:17:13.962
It's time for sound.

1:17:16.923 --> 1:17:17.758
Manar.

1:17:23.221 --> 1:17:24.473
Ready, Kareem?

1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:28.435
-Should I hold it for you?
-No need, I know it by heart.

1:17:28.518 --> 1:17:31.438
Manar, it's just the guitar
for now. Okay?

1:17:47.663 --> 1:17:49.706
Let us go as we are

1:17:50.624 --> 1:17:52.542
A free lover

1:17:53.251 --> 1:17:54.878
And her poet

1:17:55.796 --> 1:17:57.881
Let us go together

1:17:58.715 --> 1:18:02.761
On two different paths

1:18:03.845 --> 1:18:06.181
Let us go as we are

1:18:07.557 --> 1:18:08.975
United

1:18:09.476 --> 1:18:11.311
And separate

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.439
Let us go together

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:16.608
And let us...

1:18:17.567 --> 1:18:18.777
Be kind

1:18:23.615 --> 1:18:24.950
Give me drums.

1:18:26.243 --> 1:18:29.746
Three... Two... One.

1:18:30.122 --> 1:18:32.749
If only I could write you
A song of clichés

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:34.960
But it's the one thing I can't do

1:18:35.043 --> 1:18:38.046
I want to imagine us
Kissing in the rain

1:18:38.130 --> 1:18:41.216
But rain is trauma
It's a leaking roof

1:18:41.299 --> 1:18:43.802
I place pots in all the corners

1:18:43.885 --> 1:18:46.096
Water floods the house

1:18:46.596 --> 1:18:48.682
I hide my love songs in the drawer

1:18:48.765 --> 1:18:52.018
I'll read them
After my problems are solved

1:18:52.102 --> 1:18:54.604
Now I am standing wet
On your doorstep

1:18:54.771 --> 1:18:57.065
Pull me out of the street

1:18:57.315 --> 1:18:58.984
Cover me with your clothes

1:18:59.067 --> 1:19:02.362
I'm afraid to stand weak in front of you

1:19:02.446 --> 1:19:05.449
Exorcise out of me the demon of poverty
The demon of oppression

1:19:05.532 --> 1:19:07.784
The feeling that there is no tomorrow

1:19:07.868 --> 1:19:11.413
Exorcise out of me the demon of drugs
The loans to the banks

1:19:11.496 --> 1:19:13.832
And hug me like there is no tomorrow

1:19:14.332 --> 1:19:16.293
If only

1:19:16.835 --> 1:19:19.212
I could write you of my love

1:19:19.337 --> 1:19:24.092
I sing against the wall
But am building another wall between us

1:19:24.593 --> 1:19:27.053
If only

1:19:27.512 --> 1:19:29.681
I could write you of my love

1:19:29.765 --> 1:19:33.727
If only

1:19:34.478 --> 1:19:35.854
Is here good?

1:19:40.567 --> 1:19:41.735
Just like that.

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:50.660
Do you understand what's going on?

1:19:50.744 --> 1:19:54.623
Half a million Internet downloads.
And we haven't even started!

1:19:54.706 --> 1:19:56.708
This is the first poster we hang!

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:00.587
We should cover it all.

1:20:17.395 --> 1:20:19.856
Let us go as we are

1:20:19.940 --> 1:20:22.442
A free lover

1:20:22.901 --> 1:20:26.738
And her poet

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:31.284
Let us go together

1:20:33.203 --> 1:20:38.333
On two different paths

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:41.294
Let us go as we are

1:20:41.378 --> 1:20:43.338
United

1:20:43.755 --> 1:20:48.051
And separate

1:20:49.177 --> 1:20:52.597
Let us go together

1:20:55.058 --> 1:21:00.772
And let us be kind

1:21:03.275 --> 1:21:06.653
Manar's voice fits perfectly...

1:21:09.656 --> 1:21:10.490
Hello.

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:13.201
Hello, Kareem.
It's Sami, Manar's cousin.

1:21:13.368 --> 1:21:14.744
Hello, Sami, what's up?

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:18.874
We want to ask you for a favor.
We'll appreciate it if you can help.

1:21:18.957 --> 1:21:23.295
We saw the posters for your concert.
We don't like that Manar is in them.

1:21:23.545 --> 1:21:25.046
You know our family.

1:21:25.213 --> 1:21:26.590
It will bring us shame.

1:21:26.673 --> 1:21:29.342
We'd like you to forbid her
from performing.

1:21:29.467 --> 1:21:32.929
Sami, please! It's the 21st century.
What's wrong with you?

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:34.764
Don't disrespect our family.

1:21:34.848 --> 1:21:38.393
I'm not arguing with you.
But we aren't doing anything wrong.

1:21:38.476 --> 1:21:40.228
It's not up for debate.

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.314
This girl has no boundaries.

1:21:42.647 --> 1:21:44.608
Look, let's talk face to face.

1:21:44.691 --> 1:21:48.069
This is an emergency.
We can't do this over the phone.

1:21:48.278 --> 1:21:49.279
Where are you?

1:21:57.913 --> 1:21:59.372
Can I turn on the radio?

1:22:04.252 --> 1:22:06.296
Should I rap?
To break the ice...

1:22:06.379 --> 1:22:07.839
No need.

1:22:08.131 --> 1:22:09.633
We're about to arrive.

1:22:10.342 --> 1:22:12.636
Sirens... Burn it, George

1:22:36.284 --> 1:22:37.118
Hello.

1:22:37.202 --> 1:22:38.119
Hello.

1:22:42.248 --> 1:22:44.084
God bless your father's soul.

1:22:44.417 --> 1:22:46.169
He was a dear friend of ours.

1:22:46.378 --> 1:22:50.006
But it seems he didn't raise you
according to our traditions.

1:22:50.090 --> 1:22:51.383
My father wasn't...

1:22:52.133 --> 1:22:53.593
He wasn't that type.

1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:55.971
We are a traditional family.

1:22:56.054 --> 1:22:59.140
Manar's performance will bring us shame.

1:22:59.933 --> 1:23:01.434
And if that happens...

1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:04.688
We'll be forced to use
other means with her.

1:23:04.771 --> 1:23:07.440
-What means? I don't get it.
-Our own means.

1:23:11.736 --> 1:23:12.862
Pardon us, uncle.

1:23:13.154 --> 1:23:15.323
I want to speak with him in private.

1:23:23.373 --> 1:23:25.625
We are tired of reasoning with Manar.

1:23:25.709 --> 1:23:27.627
I'm talking to you man to man.

1:23:28.169 --> 1:23:29.838
Men understand each other.

1:23:30.422 --> 1:23:31.965
Don't make us hurt Manar.

1:23:33.174 --> 1:23:34.634
We love her very much.

1:23:38.972 --> 1:23:40.348
Don't upset us, okay?

1:23:46.021 --> 1:23:47.355
Mom, give us a minute.

1:23:47.939 --> 1:23:48.940
I want to listen.

1:23:49.274 --> 1:23:50.817
It doesn't concern you.

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:53.236
It does concern me.
You are my son.

1:23:53.737 --> 1:23:56.156
I just want to listen.
I won't interfere.

1:23:56.823 --> 1:23:57.866
Kareem, let her.

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:11.046
I met your cousins.
They mean business.

1:24:11.546 --> 1:24:15.508
They said that if I let you perform,
then they might hurt you.

1:24:16.551 --> 1:24:19.095
It's my decision,
not yours or my cousins'.

1:24:19.929 --> 1:24:21.890
I'm going on stage as we agreed.

1:24:21.973 --> 1:24:23.808
Manar, you are not listening...

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:24.893
She's right.

1:24:24.976 --> 1:24:27.020
It's her decision, no one else's.

1:24:28.313 --> 1:24:30.940
-Didn't you say you won't intervene?
-I lied.

1:24:31.024 --> 1:24:32.150
I didn't ask for your opinion...

1:24:32.233 --> 1:24:35.820
I gave it a lot of thinking.
And I can't put her in any risk.

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:38.031
I can't let Manar on stage. Period.

1:24:38.114 --> 1:24:40.450
Who are you to decide
whether Manar goes on stage?

1:24:40.533 --> 1:24:43.453
Because I was kidnapped.
Not you, not her. Me.

1:24:43.536 --> 1:24:45.455
You weren't forced into the car.

1:24:45.538 --> 1:24:46.831
-They threatened me.
-With what?

1:24:46.915 --> 1:24:48.750
That they might hurt you!

1:24:48.958 --> 1:24:50.794
But you hurting me is better?

1:24:51.503 --> 1:24:54.464
Me hurting you?
I'm trying to protect you, Manar.

1:24:54.964 --> 1:24:55.882
What about me?

1:24:56.925 --> 1:24:58.093
Don't I have a say?

1:24:58.176 --> 1:24:59.761
This is for your own good.

1:25:02.263 --> 1:25:03.306
You're a coward.

1:25:04.015 --> 1:25:06.142
And I'll never sing with you again.

1:25:08.019 --> 1:25:08.853
Manar.

1:25:11.147 --> 1:25:12.232
Manar!

1:25:43.930 --> 1:25:44.848
Manar...

1:25:45.765 --> 1:25:48.560
Answer, my love.
I'm not going to stop calling.

1:25:59.112 --> 1:25:59.988
So?

1:26:00.530 --> 1:26:01.823
Reading in the dark?

1:26:03.491 --> 1:26:06.369
You used to warn us
about reading in the dark.

1:26:08.371 --> 1:26:10.206
I read and write in the dark.

1:26:10.790 --> 1:26:13.001
This light is only to keep me awake.

1:26:16.045 --> 1:26:16.880
So?

1:26:17.463 --> 1:26:18.798
Everything all right?

1:26:19.382 --> 1:26:20.466
Pray for me, Mom.

1:26:21.801 --> 1:26:22.635
Come.

1:26:32.770 --> 1:26:34.355
May God protect you, son.

1:26:34.439 --> 1:26:35.648
And reward you.

1:26:35.732 --> 1:26:37.650
And keep you from trouble.

1:26:38.151 --> 1:26:40.320
And give you wealth and heirs.

1:26:40.486 --> 1:26:42.947
And open the doors of heaven for you.

1:26:43.031 --> 1:26:46.117
God, make his choices the right ones.

1:26:46.409 --> 1:26:48.661
May God show you the right path, son.

1:26:48.745 --> 1:26:50.705
May God show you the right path.

1:26:58.463 --> 1:26:59.881
That's a .22 caliber...

1:27:00.173 --> 1:27:01.758
It's a 9 mm.

1:27:04.719 --> 1:27:06.930
You think I'm crazy.

1:27:08.848 --> 1:27:11.434
But I know things
that you will never know.

1:27:23.196 --> 1:27:24.989
-What do you think, Amir?
-Wow!

1:27:25.073 --> 1:27:26.658
-Is it okay?
-Very much!

1:27:34.874 --> 1:27:35.917
Hey...

1:27:38.795 --> 1:27:40.964
You asked me to come and here I am.

1:27:41.047 --> 1:27:42.173
Thanks, Mom.

1:27:42.423 --> 1:27:44.968
Now it's my turn to ask you for something.

1:27:45.051 --> 1:27:47.303
Call Manar.
Ask her to come.

1:28:06.364 --> 1:28:10.285
Darling, the place is full and there is
a microphone with your name on it.

1:28:14.455 --> 1:28:16.791
If only

1:28:17.333 --> 1:28:19.544
I could write you of my love

1:28:19.627 --> 1:28:23.965
I sing against the wall
But am building another wall between us

1:28:25.049 --> 1:28:27.093
If only

1:28:27.802 --> 1:28:30.263
I could write you of my love

1:28:30.346 --> 1:28:33.641
If only

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:36.728
If only I could write you
A song of clichés

1:28:36.811 --> 1:28:39.355
But it's the one thing I can't do

1:28:39.439 --> 1:28:42.567
I want to imagine us kissing in the rain

1:28:42.650 --> 1:28:45.653
But rain is trauma
It's a leaking roof

1:28:45.737 --> 1:28:48.114
I place pots in all the corners

1:28:48.197 --> 1:28:50.616
The water floods the house

1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:52.785
I hide my love songs in the drawer

1:28:52.869 --> 1:28:56.456
I'll read them
After my problems are solved

1:28:56.539 --> 1:28:58.958
Now I am standing wet
On your doorstep

1:28:59.042 --> 1:29:01.377
Pull me out of the street

1:29:01.669 --> 1:29:03.504
Cover me with your clothes

1:29:03.588 --> 1:29:06.883
I'm afraid to stand weak in front of you

1:29:06.966 --> 1:29:08.468
Exorcise out of me the demon of poverty

1:29:08.593 --> 1:29:10.053
The demon of oppression

1:29:10.136 --> 1:29:12.430
The feeling that there is no tomorrow

1:29:12.513 --> 1:29:16.017
Exorcise out of me the demon of drugs
The loans to the banks

1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:17.643
And hug me like there is no tomorrow

1:29:18.519 --> 1:29:20.605
If only

1:29:20.938 --> 1:29:23.649
I could write you of my love

1:29:23.733 --> 1:29:28.154
I sing against the wall
But am building another wall between us

1:29:29.030 --> 1:29:31.324
If only

1:29:31.783 --> 1:29:34.035
I could write you of my love

1:29:34.452 --> 1:29:37.205
If only

1:29:37.789 --> 1:29:40.291
Mahmoud Darwish wrote that
We'll become a nation

1:29:40.374 --> 1:29:43.002
When the poet will describe
The female body

1:29:43.086 --> 1:29:45.338
I say, we'll become a nation

1:29:45.421 --> 1:29:49.675
When the female poet
Will describe the male body

1:29:49.759 --> 1:29:51.761
I write against the siege on Gaza

1:29:51.844 --> 1:29:54.305
Against those who brought us darkness

1:29:54.388 --> 1:29:57.558
I write for the camps
And meanwhile

1:29:57.642 --> 1:30:00.394
The love song is a refugee
In my drawer

1:30:00.478 --> 1:30:02.396
I am a refugee on your doorstep

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:05.566
Teach me that oppression
Is a border, not a subject

1:30:05.775 --> 1:30:07.652
Take off my clothes, I am ready

1:30:07.777 --> 1:30:10.488
To stand naked in front of you

1:30:10.863 --> 1:30:13.866
Create in me the demon of wisdom
The demon of trust

1:30:13.950 --> 1:30:16.077
So I won't fear of you, nor for you

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:19.664
Create in me the demon of passion
The demon of revolution

1:30:19.747 --> 1:30:22.041
I will fight for both freedom and love

1:30:22.583 --> 1:30:24.210
Let us go as we are

1:30:24.418 --> 1:30:27.130
A free lover

1:30:27.672 --> 1:30:31.092
And her poet

1:30:32.635 --> 1:30:35.388
Let us go together

1:30:37.974 --> 1:30:43.187
On two different paths

1:30:43.271 --> 1:30:45.940
Let us go as we are

1:30:46.023 --> 1:30:48.109
United

1:30:48.526 --> 1:30:53.156
And separate

1:30:53.823 --> 1:30:57.618
Let us go together

1:30:59.745 --> 1:31:05.585
And let us be kind
