00:00.934 --> 00:03.698
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:03.803 --> 00:06.135
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.231
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.866
Tripp, the empire builder.

00:09.943 --> 00:13.242
Do you want to tell them why you want
to destroy my family or shall I?

00:13.313 --> 00:15.406
Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.916
Which of our children isn't mine?

00:17.984 --> 00:19.645
Brian is your brother.

00:19.719 --> 00:20.879
Brian, the man of God.

00:20.954 --> 00:24.253
Brian Darling is under arrest
for attempting to bribe a public official.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.882
Karen,
the professional divorcee.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.085
My dad can never find out
about this, okay?

00:28.161 --> 00:29.890
Patrick, the principled politician.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.430
End things with Carmelita

00:31.498 --> 00:34.126
or I will end any shot you have
of a seat in the senate.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.225
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.634
I want this girl to like me for me.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.729
You're a Darling.
As soon as she finds that out,

00:39.806 --> 00:40.966
things are never gonna be the same.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.041
I told her I was an artist.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.507
You need to stop lying to this woman.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.908
Could you just hook me up with,
like, five paintings, please?

00:52.786 --> 00:56.483
What do you see when you look
at me with the eyes of a great painter?

00:57.757 --> 01:00.089
Well, I don't know
if I'd use the word "great. "

01:00.560 --> 01:02.653
Don't be modest. Tell me.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.221
Okay.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.462
A peach.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.672
A plum.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.969
A road

01:15.542 --> 01:17.305
that goes on and on.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.440
I can't wait for you to paint me.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.915
It's been two weeks.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.416
You can't rush the master, Sofia.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.917
I know. You have your process.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.552
No, it's not a process, it's a way of life.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.757
Unlike my desire,

01:37.831 --> 01:41.198
which I can expend on you
four times a day.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.359
Five.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.800
My inspiration can't just be turned on.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.739
It needs time to build, to gather

01:50.076 --> 01:52.772
and then it explodes onto the canvas.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.590
Does that inspire you?

02:08.828 --> 02:10.762
I'll start tomorrow.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.499
It's been a while
since we did that in the morning.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.867
I'll say.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.108
Since we did that, period.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.302
Everything old is new again.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.242
Was that okay for you? You seemed...

02:28.314 --> 02:31.078
Are you kidding me?
That was sensational.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.847
It's just, you know,
my leg is a little sore. That's all.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.753
Oh. You're still mad I shot you.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.792
No, I'm not, honey.
I'm just telling the truth.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.589
My leg hurts where you shot me,
that's all.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.631
From now on, it's nothing but the truth
between you and I, okay?

02:45.698 --> 02:47.461
No more lies. No more

02:48.301 --> 02:49.666
Carmelita.

02:50.870 --> 02:51.837
Okay?

02:52.138 --> 02:53.230
Yeah.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.907
You get it.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.877
I'm gonna take a shower.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.381
Carmelita, stop calling. Please.

03:09.456 --> 03:13.187
I wrote you 10 e-mails last night.
You never responded.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.624
What's the matter?

03:14.694 --> 03:16.025
I think I'm being followed.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.654
Oh, what exactly makes you think that?

03:17.764 --> 03:19.288
It's just a feeling.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.267
I got home from class last night,
and things were just out of place.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.032
I can't explain it.
I think someone had been here.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.437
Okay.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.737
I'll be over as soon as I can.

03:29.809 --> 03:30.969
Bye.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.776
Who the hell is that?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.244
Robert Russell.

03:34.314 --> 03:35.611
- The painter?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.377
- Well, tell him to go away.
- I can't.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.782
He's having second thoughts
about the Jeremy Darling project.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.684
Oh, it's a project now? A project.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.051
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.182
Jeremy is actually coming by
the gallery this morning

03:45.258 --> 03:46.816
to learn from Robert how to draw

03:46.926 --> 03:50.259
and to collect his five works in progress
of Sofia so he can

03:50.330 --> 03:52.059
fake being a painter in real time,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.793
and Robert's starting to feel like

03:53.867 --> 03:56.165
the whole thing is putting his integrity
at stake. It's pretty bad.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.396
Well, welcome to life with the Darlings.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.939
- Hello?
- Nick. It's Simon elder.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.936
Hey, Simon. What's up?

04:06.012 --> 04:08.276
Can you come over to my office?

04:08.348 --> 04:09.406
This morning?

04:09.482 --> 04:11.347
Yeah. Say, 10:00.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.719
Yeah, sure. Is everything all right?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.185
I'll tell you when you get here.

04:15.288 --> 04:18.154
It's... it's a delicate matter.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.755
I'll see you then.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.794
Bye, Nick.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.762
What's so delicate?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.428
You.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.373
Hey.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.933
How about some cherry lemonade?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.375
Oh, yeah. I'd love some.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.604
So, what are you doing tonight?

04:39.679 --> 04:42.842
It's the annual nutcracker evening
with the Darlings.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.213
It's a family tradition.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.251
Oh!

04:45.351 --> 04:46.318
Why?

04:46.419 --> 04:51.049
Well, I have someone important coming
in from out of town I'd like you to meet.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.615
All right, then I'll be there. Done.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.293
Mmm. That's perfection.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.263
You really know how to treat a girl.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.459
Most people want the same things.

05:01.534 --> 05:02.694
Sugar.

05:03.870 --> 05:04.837
Salt.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.435
Attention.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.441
You are the best kisser.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.211
Brian?

05:19.852 --> 05:21.217
What are you doing here?

05:22.956 --> 05:25.117
- I came to tell you...
- What?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.782
That nothing's changed?

05:27.527 --> 05:28.494
That's a lie.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.828
That I'm still your son? Lie.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.599
That you still love me?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.863
That was never true.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.766
So maybe that's the one thing
that won't change.

05:38.871 --> 05:42.238
No. Everything has changed.
Everything.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.837
You're not my son.

05:45.411 --> 05:49.643
I spent most of your life trying to
find me in you and I never could.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.645
Now we know why.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.785
I loved your dad

05:53.853 --> 05:56.083
and I came to tell you

05:56.155 --> 05:59.488
that I look forward to having
this relationship with you.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.557
Thanks.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.256
I've got a meeting to get to.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.934
Reverend Darling,
we've known each other a while, yes?

06:09.068 --> 06:11.161
Ten long years.

06:11.237 --> 06:15.367
And I watched you proudly
as you found your own

06:15.808 --> 06:17.366
special way.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.069
Unique.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.974
You always did things
differently, Brian.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.175
That has been your blessing.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.049
Thank you.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.055
But this independent spirit of yours

06:30.923 --> 06:32.788
is also your downfall.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.687
Brian,

06:37.730 --> 06:42.064
it pains me
to have this conversation with you.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.131
Not as much as it pains me.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.467
In the same period of time

06:46.839 --> 06:50.275
when you were righteously
ministering to your flock,

06:50.610 --> 06:55.309
you initiated a sexual relationship
with a parishioner,

06:55.381 --> 06:59.147
fathered a child out of wedlock
and, most recently,

07:00.353 --> 07:01.684
bribed a judge.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.120
- It was an arbitrator, actually.
- Oh, Brian.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.157
I wanted to get my son back.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.386
And his mother was gonna
whisk him away to stupid Brazil

07:08.461 --> 07:10.292
and just when I started
to connect to him!

07:10.363 --> 07:14.322
And you felt you had no other choice
but to commit a felony?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.924
I'm sorry, Brian.

07:16.202 --> 07:20.468
The state board has decided
to suspend you for six months,

07:20.540 --> 07:23.839
during which time
you are expected to undergo

07:23.910 --> 07:26.208
counseling for sexual addiction

07:27.113 --> 07:29.547
and attend a series of workshops.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.509
Who doesn't love workshops?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.613
Brian.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.719
You have a lot of work to do

07:40.293 --> 07:43.456
and you have a lot of questions
to ask yourself.

07:44.597 --> 07:45.962
About what?

07:47.233 --> 07:51.329
Whether you still feel called
to serve the lord.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.342
So what's this all about?

07:58.544 --> 08:01.104
Before I tell you, I wanna make sure
that we're still cool.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.476
We're okay.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.709
- I have some concerns.
- About?

08:05.885 --> 08:08.012
Tell me. Let's get it all out.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.521
That night up at Valhalla,
when Tripp told the story

08:10.590 --> 08:12.455
about your parents working
for the Darling family,

08:12.525 --> 08:14.049
- emigrating to Russia.
- Yeah?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.857
It did leave me
with some questions about you

08:16.929 --> 08:19.193
and your intentions
regarding the family.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.698
I assure you,

08:20.767 --> 08:23.235
the only connection they have
to my vision for New York

08:23.302 --> 08:24.963
now, today,

08:25.772 --> 08:27.899
is that they're in the way.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.532
But it's nothing personal. It's not.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.078
I'm listening.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.274
I need you to...

08:36.649 --> 08:39.174
I would like for you to get me copies

08:39.251 --> 08:43.813
of Darling enterprises' profit and loss
statements for the last five years,

08:44.056 --> 08:45.990
and a list of all their holdings.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.719
Simon, the only people
who have access

08:47.794 --> 08:50.092
to that information are
members of the family.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.131
You're part of the family, right?

08:52.231 --> 08:55.257
That's a pretty sizable betrayal
you're asking me to perpetrate.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.859
No. Don't think of it as betrayal.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.899
It's synthesis.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.942
Is that it?

09:08.014 --> 09:11.245
No. No. There is one more thing.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.885
I've started seeing
someone, romantically,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.313
and I wanted to tell you.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.352
So that I could congratulate you?

09:19.425 --> 09:21.154
It's Karen Darling.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.022
Really?

09:24.464 --> 09:25.556
Okay.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.123
I know you two have a history.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.260
We do, but it's pretty far back, really.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.499
I'm more concerned
that this might be some sort of

09:34.474 --> 09:37.136
plan of yours to tear Karen
away from Tripp

09:37.210 --> 09:38.700
the way that you did with Patrick.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.872
Patrick followed his heart.
It had nothing to do with me.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.506
As for Karen,

09:44.183 --> 09:45.741
yes, I genuinely like her.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.911
I think she's a very dynamic woman,

09:47.987 --> 09:50.888
but I won't pursue her if it's gonna
be a problem for me and you.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.448
Our relationship is too important.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.095
Is it gonna be a problem?

09:58.564 --> 10:00.191
Why should it be?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.858
Look, you're both adults. It's fine.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.429
Okay.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.881
Is everybody excited
about the nutcracker?

10:24.953 --> 10:26.386
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it.

10:26.454 --> 10:27.682
Why?

10:27.756 --> 10:29.223
Because I'm

10:30.025 --> 10:31.515
gonna be out and about.

10:31.593 --> 10:34.357
Karen, it's the nutcracker.

10:34.462 --> 10:37.090
I'm sorry, mom, but I'm gonna be busy.

10:38.433 --> 10:41.197
If she's busy, she's busy.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.999
I think you're freaked out
about attending a family event

10:45.073 --> 10:48.975
without a lover to protect you
from the intimacy of your tribe.

10:49.044 --> 10:50.511
You've been spending so much time

10:50.578 --> 10:52.876
living from your swadhisthana,

10:52.947 --> 10:55.313
you need to get up into your anahata

10:55.417 --> 10:57.248
and start feeling it.

10:57.819 --> 11:00.287
I learned that in the Seychelles.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.324
Honey, I'm really starting to regret
giving you my honeymoon.

11:03.491 --> 11:05.459
You know who really
needs a honeymoon?

11:05.527 --> 11:07.688
Brian. Poor guy.

11:07.829 --> 11:09.888
I know. Mom, what are we
gonna do about that?

11:09.964 --> 11:11.431
If I woke up tomorrow

11:11.499 --> 11:15.196
and knew that I didn't really
belong here, I would kill myself.

11:15.270 --> 11:18.239
Just because Brian is not
my biological son

11:18.473 --> 11:20.532
does not mean that he does not belong.

11:20.608 --> 11:22.974
He's still your brother. Stop it.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.172
Hello, dear.

11:26.247 --> 11:27.612
You all talking about me?

11:27.715 --> 11:29.410
- No.
- I know.

11:30.585 --> 11:33.679
We're not all related. I'm sorry.
Not my fault.

11:35.723 --> 11:38.692
There's somebody downstairs for you.
Some guy.

11:40.795 --> 11:41.921
Okay.

11:44.799 --> 11:47.063
I don't know what may have
happened to her

11:47.135 --> 11:49.501
on those distant green islands,

11:50.338 --> 11:52.704
but it was certainly salutary.

11:56.177 --> 11:58.805
Kai! You're here, you made it!

11:58.880 --> 12:01.144
I made it. It was quite a journey.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.116
How was your flight?
Did you fly first class?

12:03.184 --> 12:05.209
I told them to make sure
that you flew first class.

12:05.286 --> 12:08.255
Yes, I did and it was wild.

12:08.790 --> 12:12.487
I don't think I've ever been treated
this well on land or in mid-air.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.528
Sir, may I take that bag upstairs
for you?

12:14.596 --> 12:16.063
I'm okay, man. Thank you very much.

12:16.131 --> 12:17.257
I missed you so much.

12:17.332 --> 12:19.027
I missed you, too.

12:20.268 --> 12:22.031
Everything's falling apart.

12:22.103 --> 12:24.196
I've lost my wife, my daughters,

12:24.272 --> 12:26.832
my one-time mistress, my son.

12:26.941 --> 12:28.499
I found out my father's not my father.

12:28.576 --> 12:29.736
And now I've lost my job.

12:29.844 --> 12:32.005
I mean, what's next, leprosy?

12:32.514 --> 12:34.880
Yeah, it sounds to me like

12:35.717 --> 12:37.082
you need to be patient.

12:37.152 --> 12:38.676
The bishop has outlined a program

12:38.753 --> 12:41.654
where eventually you can

12:42.557 --> 12:43.581
regain your post.

12:43.658 --> 12:45.148
But I'm not sure I want to.

12:46.027 --> 12:47.927
You're so good at it.

12:48.329 --> 12:51.628
The sermon that you gave
at Karen's wedding...

12:51.699 --> 12:53.667
It was fine. I whipped it together.

12:53.768 --> 12:57.067
And those baptismal prayers you wrote
for Patrick and Ellen's children.

12:57.138 --> 12:58.366
Those were published.

12:58.439 --> 13:00.202
'Cause I'm a Darling. Was.

13:00.275 --> 13:01.333
- Brian...
- You know what I mean.

13:01.409 --> 13:04.242
Well, you can't deny
you have a way of articulating

13:04.312 --> 13:07.873
the questions that people
have about God and faith.

13:07.949 --> 13:10.008
Because they're the questions I've got,

13:10.084 --> 13:11.449
in spades.

13:11.786 --> 13:12.878
The truth is

13:12.954 --> 13:15.047
I've never really felt
the presence of the lord

13:15.123 --> 13:16.886
the way other people say that they do.

13:16.991 --> 13:19.721
Never? I find that hard to believe.

13:19.794 --> 13:22.160
Sure, I get weepy at Christmas.

13:22.797 --> 13:24.822
The crucifixion kind of gets to me.

13:25.133 --> 13:28.466
But that's not the same
as actually having faith.

13:32.106 --> 13:35.075
Do you think this is all coming up

13:35.143 --> 13:37.771
because of recent revelations?

13:38.379 --> 13:40.438
Well, my so-called brothers and sisters

13:40.515 --> 13:43.006
are treating me the way
they always have, mom,

13:43.084 --> 13:44.745
like an alien.

13:45.086 --> 13:46.849
This is about faith.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.990
And I'm not sure I ever really had any.

13:50.058 --> 13:51.218
Well,

13:51.793 --> 13:53.454
maybe you should talk
to your father then.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.689
He's not my father.

13:56.130 --> 13:57.961
He raised you, Brian.

13:58.499 --> 13:59.830
Go to him.

14:00.134 --> 14:04.833
He's more familiar with these kinds
of cosmic doubts than I am.

14:05.974 --> 14:07.464
There.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.067
Didn't that settle you down a little?

14:10.878 --> 14:12.243
Yeah, it did.

14:13.081 --> 14:14.514
Thanks, mom.

14:21.022 --> 14:22.785
Hey. Where's Picasso?

14:22.857 --> 14:24.552
He'll be here in a minute.

14:24.626 --> 14:26.491
His name is Robert Russell,
and you better be nice to him

14:26.561 --> 14:28.222
'cause he's doing you a big favor,
all right?

14:28.296 --> 14:29.388
Okay.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.331
Whoa. That is one big sponge.

14:35.436 --> 14:37.199
Yeah, it just arrived from Berlin.

14:37.305 --> 14:40.274
What do you clean with it?
Like, big art?

14:40.575 --> 14:41.735
It is art, Jeremy.

14:41.843 --> 14:44.141
It just sold for $ 150,000.

14:44.479 --> 14:46.709
I don't think I've ever said this,
but that seems overpriced.

14:46.781 --> 14:49.545
Maybe, maybe not.
Depends on who's buying it.

14:49.617 --> 14:51.983
The way I see it is when you buy art,
you're buying a window.

14:52.153 --> 14:55.179
When you look at the art,
whether it's a painting or a sculpture,

14:55.256 --> 14:56.553
or whatever, and you see through it

14:56.624 --> 14:58.182
into something new,

14:58.259 --> 14:59.749
it's worth it.

14:59.894 --> 15:01.418
I see a sponge.

15:02.664 --> 15:03.892
Me, too.

15:04.198 --> 15:06.223
I wish you could stay forever.

15:06.301 --> 15:09.236
But my Uncle is counting on me
to come back.

15:09.304 --> 15:11.204
Oh, it's just that...

15:12.073 --> 15:14.507
Everything feels so different
with you here.

15:15.143 --> 15:18.601
Well, then just make sure we make
these two weeks last.

15:19.213 --> 15:20.680
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:22.216 --> 15:26.175
So he wants financial
statements and a list of all our holdings.

15:27.488 --> 15:29.752
So what do you want me to do?

15:32.960 --> 15:35.520
I think we should give them to him.

15:36.798 --> 15:37.958
Okay.

15:38.032 --> 15:39.465
This is what we've been waiting for.

15:39.534 --> 15:42.298
Isn't this Mr. elder
showing us his hand?

15:43.071 --> 15:45.005
Are you gonna have somebody
doctor the numbers?

15:45.073 --> 15:47.098
'Cause if you are,
I don't want to take any part in that.

15:47.175 --> 15:50.042
Nick, come on. You know...

15:50.511 --> 15:53.173
We're just gonna show him
what we want him to see.

15:53.247 --> 15:56.478
I'll have the accountant put together
some papers.

15:56.884 --> 15:59.853
Karen will bring them
over to your office, okay?

16:02.290 --> 16:03.416
Nick.

16:04.859 --> 16:07.623
Let every adverse force converge.

16:08.629 --> 16:10.392
We have Mr. elder

16:10.965 --> 16:12.990
exactly where we want him.

16:14.135 --> 16:16.365
All right. I'll see you later.

16:26.881 --> 16:30.044
Simon elder just asked
for our financial reports.

16:30.818 --> 16:33.116
Find out what he's up to, okay?

16:46.362 --> 16:47.386
Here you go.

16:47.463 --> 16:49.294
Profit and loss statements
for Darling enterprises

16:49.365 --> 16:51.026
going five years back.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.068
What are you gonna do with them?

16:53.136 --> 16:55.366
Nothing. I'm just making sure
everything is in order.

16:55.438 --> 16:58.464
Nick, seriously,
what are you and daddy up to?

17:02.278 --> 17:03.973
There's something
you're not telling me.

17:04.046 --> 17:06.945
You're right, Karen, there is.
And I'm not.

17:07.183 --> 17:08.877
How's Simon elder?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.978
- You heard about that?
- Yes, I have,

17:12.054 --> 17:15.021
and it's only a matter of time before
your father hears about it as well.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.184
Not from me. I won't tell him.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.352
I wouldn't want to see his face.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.656
Nick, all Simon and I do is talk, okay?

17:20.730 --> 17:23.096
We talk about different ways
to make the world a better place.

17:23.165 --> 17:25.498
You could join us sometime
on one of our talks.

17:25.568 --> 17:27.001
- Might be fun.
- Thank you, no.

17:27.069 --> 17:28.696
Your loss. Promise me something?

17:28.771 --> 17:30.534
- What?
- Don't tell daddy.

17:30.606 --> 17:32.301
I promise I won't.

17:32.608 --> 17:33.700
Okay.

17:33.776 --> 17:35.471
You gonna nutcracker
with the fam tonight?

17:35.545 --> 17:37.479
Yeah, I am. I'm gonna bring Kiki. You?

17:37.547 --> 17:40.778
No. No, I'm kind of over it.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.983
But you kids have fun.

17:43.386 --> 17:44.444
Bye.

17:48.591 --> 17:51.151
It's all right. It's okay.

17:52.995 --> 17:55.486
I'm here, baby.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

17:55.565 --> 17:57.226
It's not, though.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.861
When I got home last night,

18:00.369 --> 18:02.929
I could tell little things
had been moved.

18:03.005 --> 18:05.064
Those drawers were open.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.041
That light was on. I know I turned it off.

18:09.312 --> 18:10.745
What are you looking for?

18:10.813 --> 18:11.905
Bugs.

18:12.014 --> 18:13.106
Bugs?

18:13.516 --> 18:15.381
Surveillance devices.

18:15.651 --> 18:16.982
Detective Darling?

18:17.053 --> 18:19.544
Well, I want you to be safe, right?

18:19.689 --> 18:21.657
You do believe me, don't you, paddy?

18:21.757 --> 18:24.123
I believe you. Of course I do.

18:24.227 --> 18:27.094
In fact, I'm gonna put somebody
right outside that door, 24l7.

18:27.163 --> 18:28.528
The police?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.761
Unfortunately, I can't involve
the police for this

18:32.835 --> 18:35.167
because I'm the Attorney General

18:35.605 --> 18:37.539
and you're not my wife.

18:37.874 --> 18:41.401
But don't worry, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

18:41.477 --> 18:42.739
Trust me?

18:56.292 --> 18:58.988
Just because you're having
some doubts about God,

18:59.061 --> 19:01.689
you think that means
you have to vacate your post?

19:01.764 --> 19:04.631
I mean, there are lots
of beneficial values

19:04.700 --> 19:07.794
transmitted by religion.

19:08.404 --> 19:09.735
I guess I just thought that it would be

19:09.805 --> 19:12.137
a good time to become authentic.

19:12.909 --> 19:15.070
Did you ever believe?

19:15.711 --> 19:16.871
Really?

19:17.980 --> 19:19.447
I don't know.

19:20.383 --> 19:22.510
The idea of it always interested me.

19:22.585 --> 19:23.711
The idea?

19:23.786 --> 19:26.118
The idea that there's something

19:26.522 --> 19:28.422
that gives its life up

19:28.691 --> 19:30.852
to make room for more life.

19:31.027 --> 19:32.085
That

19:32.695 --> 19:34.424
I find fascinating.

19:34.530 --> 19:36.498
No, don't... no, seriously.

19:36.599 --> 19:38.567
I've always envied you,

19:39.902 --> 19:41.062
your

19:42.605 --> 19:44.232
life of the mind.

19:44.507 --> 19:46.441
Yeah, I mean, me,

19:46.509 --> 19:47.840
I've been stuck,

19:48.010 --> 19:50.877
fumbling with the nuts and bolts
of big business.

19:50.947 --> 19:54.610
I mean, I've seen myself referred
to as an empire builder.

19:55.184 --> 19:56.674
That's not me.

19:57.353 --> 19:59.321
That was my grandfather.

20:00.523 --> 20:03.686
Me? I'm an empire maintainer.

20:05.828 --> 20:08.695
Do you really want to leave behind

20:09.165 --> 20:11.395
the world of ideas?

20:12.802 --> 20:14.770
What could be better?

20:16.739 --> 20:18.229
I don't know.

20:20.476 --> 20:22.808
I really don't know what to do.

20:25.081 --> 20:27.606
I can't tell you what to do.

20:29.151 --> 20:31.119
That's for you to decide.

20:38.527 --> 20:41.428
- Sorry. Not gonna happen.
- He's not coming?

20:41.497 --> 20:43.226
Robert said he's really interested
in helping you out,

20:43.299 --> 20:44.459
but he started a painting this morning,

20:44.533 --> 20:46.558
he's on a roll and he doesn't want to
stop working on it,

20:46.636 --> 20:48.160
so he's really sorry.

20:48.237 --> 20:50.603
- Is that really what he said?
- No.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.867
He said he feels like a whore.

20:52.975 --> 20:54.499
So what am I gonna do?

20:54.577 --> 20:55.805
If Sofia finds out I'm not an artist,

20:55.878 --> 20:59.177
she'll just think I'm poor
for no good reason and then...

20:59.248 --> 21:01.375
Wait, a minute. Look at you.

21:01.617 --> 21:02.709
What?

21:03.052 --> 21:04.212
You're not so different from her.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.187
Your height, your hips, your clothes.

21:07.256 --> 21:08.723
What's your point, Jeremy?

21:08.791 --> 21:10.122
Let me just draw you.

21:10.192 --> 21:13.286
It can be practice. If it turns out
any good, I could use it for Sofia.

21:13.362 --> 21:15.023
- It's kind of a great idea.
- It's kind of not.

21:15.097 --> 21:16.462
You can't draw and I can't just sit here

21:16.565 --> 21:17.532
and have you look at me.

21:17.633 --> 21:18.600
I wouldn't want you sitting.

21:18.701 --> 21:22.330
I want you standing,
right where you are.

21:22.405 --> 21:24.965
I'm very uncomfortable with this.

21:25.441 --> 21:28.205
I have just the thing that could make
you feel much less uncomfortable.

21:28.310 --> 21:30.403
How about a little smokie?

21:31.213 --> 21:33.113
No. This is my workplace.

21:33.182 --> 21:35.650
Which is closed.
And we need to chillax.

21:35.718 --> 21:37.549
Me to draw, you to pose.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.646
You're bad and this is bad idea.

21:40.790 --> 21:42.052
I know.

21:49.765 --> 21:51.255
Oh.

21:51.634 --> 21:52.931
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:55.438 --> 21:56.769
This is who you wanted me to meet?

21:56.839 --> 22:01.003
Karen Darling, I'd like you to meet
princess ama, from Ghana.

22:02.211 --> 22:03.872
- Pleasure.
- Hello.

22:04.380 --> 22:05.404
Okay.

22:05.481 --> 22:07.108
She's my ex-wife.

22:08.451 --> 22:09.543
Oh.

22:32.169 --> 22:34.467
We met in the middle of the ocean.

22:34.538 --> 22:35.630
How'd you guys wrangle that?

22:35.706 --> 22:39.039
My father and I took a trip to
Jeffrey's bay in South Africa

22:39.110 --> 22:41.135
to scatter my mother's ashes.

22:41.212 --> 22:43.772
But after we had scattered her ashes,

22:44.181 --> 22:45.273
I could not sleep.

22:45.349 --> 22:46.976
I walked out,

22:47.051 --> 22:49.281
past the hotel pool, onto the beach

22:49.353 --> 22:51.082
and into the ocean.

22:51.622 --> 22:54.716
I swam and swam, weeping.

22:54.792 --> 22:56.760
I missed her so much.

22:56.861 --> 22:58.123
The moon

22:58.629 --> 23:01.189
was so big it lit the sky.

23:01.932 --> 23:04.628
And just when I realized
I had gone so far,

23:04.702 --> 23:07.034
I probably could not get back...

23:09.774 --> 23:11.935
What happened?

23:12.076 --> 23:14.840
I hit my head on the side of a little boat,

23:14.945 --> 23:16.572
and he was in it.

23:18.115 --> 23:19.548
He helped me into the boat

23:19.617 --> 23:22.245
and we have been together ever since.

23:25.356 --> 23:26.516
You...

23:27.491 --> 23:29.220
You guys aren't still married, right?

23:29.293 --> 23:30.760
No, no, no.

23:30.828 --> 23:32.557
No.
We're divorced.

23:32.630 --> 23:35.895
Yes, marriage for us was
a way of keeping our distance.

23:35.966 --> 23:37.024
Not good.

23:37.101 --> 23:38.125
No.

23:45.009 --> 23:46.101
What?

23:48.813 --> 23:50.337
What'd she say?

23:51.148 --> 23:52.615
She approves.

23:52.983 --> 23:54.041
Oh!

23:56.453 --> 23:57.750
Lucky me.

24:00.391 --> 24:02.484
Just doing my job, ma'am.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.287
I know Patrick and Mr. Darling
are on the outs,

24:05.362 --> 24:08.024
but when he called and asked me
to look in on you,

24:08.098 --> 24:09.258
well, what can I say?

24:09.366 --> 24:11.994
You're family,
as much as I am, anyway.

24:12.269 --> 24:13.531
Thanks for heating that up for me.

24:13.604 --> 24:15.834
I'm just sorry I don't have
anything here to feed you.

24:15.906 --> 24:17.737
I haven't been able to get out.

24:17.808 --> 24:19.036
I could make you some cookies.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.736
Oh, that's sweet, ma'am,

24:20.811 --> 24:23.177
but sugar and stakeouts,
that's where those cops go wrong.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.010
Steamed rice and hard boiled eggs,
it's good for the brain.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.052
Keeps me sharp.
I can actually see in the dark.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.053
So, you've done this
kind of thing before?

24:31.121 --> 24:33.089
'Cause this is the first time I've ever...

24:33.157 --> 24:35.250
Well, I've never played

24:35.326 --> 24:37.760
the damsel in distress.

24:38.229 --> 24:40.891
Been with the family
for 17 years, ma'am.

24:40.965 --> 24:44.332
I've seen plenty
and we've gotten through all of it,

24:44.935 --> 24:46.459
so don't worry.

24:46.837 --> 24:49.203
Also, I put a plant in the plant.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.203
A plant in the plant?

24:52.543 --> 24:53.805
A camera.

24:54.578 --> 24:56.546
There's a live feed right into my car.

24:56.614 --> 24:59.139
I'm just a few yards away, so relax.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.709
Thank you, Clark.

25:00.784 --> 25:02.684
You sleep tight, ma'am.

25:08.125 --> 25:10.389
You know, it's funny,
if you told me six months ago

25:10.461 --> 25:12.622
that I, Jeremy Darling,

25:12.730 --> 25:15.028
would be working in a parking garage

25:15.099 --> 25:16.862
and would be pretending
to be a painter,

25:16.934 --> 25:18.834
I would not believe you.

25:18.903 --> 25:20.461
Life is full of surprises, isn't it?

25:20.571 --> 25:22.402
- It is.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:25.242 --> 25:26.971
I'm a sucky artist.

25:27.578 --> 25:28.704
I am.

25:28.879 --> 25:29.971
Look.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.849
But I'm getting better.

25:33.117 --> 25:34.846
I'm quite surprised.

25:36.353 --> 25:37.479
- That's my point!
- Yeah.

25:37.554 --> 25:39.181
That is my point. You know what?

25:39.356 --> 25:42.382
You should try being yourself
with Sofia.

25:43.294 --> 25:47.754
You need to be honest and letting
things unfold naturally, organically.

25:48.599 --> 25:50.362
- You think so?
- I do.

25:52.169 --> 25:55.104
Lying will slowly kill
your insides, Jeremy.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.537
Once she sees who you are,

25:57.608 --> 25:59.303
who you are,

26:01.278 --> 26:04.213
she'll be able to love you
for what you are.

26:04.949 --> 26:06.712
Tell her the truth.

26:08.152 --> 26:09.483
It may surprise you.

26:09.553 --> 26:12.488
It might just disappoint
everybody supremely.

26:19.296 --> 26:21.856
What's the matter?
What just happened?

26:24.101 --> 26:26.035
I'm losing my husband.

26:28.105 --> 26:29.663
What, to Karen?

26:30.607 --> 26:32.268
- Give me a break.
- To all of you.

26:32.343 --> 26:34.208
- You're stoned.
- No. No.

26:34.278 --> 26:37.338
Ever since he took this job,
he's just been slipping away.

26:37.414 --> 26:38.779
He's never around, you know?

26:38.849 --> 26:40.009
He comes home late,

26:40.084 --> 26:42.177
he leaves early, he's always so busy.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.152
And Kiki and I are just

26:44.688 --> 26:46.553
there, you know? We...

26:47.424 --> 26:50.188
We feel like we have to compete.
We're...

26:50.661 --> 26:52.094
We're there.

26:53.263 --> 26:55.026
We're there. We're...

26:56.166 --> 26:58.066
We're there missing him

26:58.535 --> 27:01.163
and loving him,
and he's off doing God knows what

27:01.238 --> 27:02.796
for all of you,

27:04.074 --> 27:05.974
and he doesn't have to.

27:10.047 --> 27:11.708
We had a good life
before he took this job.

27:11.782 --> 27:13.716
He doesn't need to do this. He doesn't.

27:13.784 --> 27:16.150
I don't get it. I don't.
And I'm sorry because I'm stoned.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.984
I'm being stupid. I'm rambling.
I'm sorry.

27:23.394 --> 27:25.294
I don't get it either.

27:28.198 --> 27:29.825
If you were mine,

27:32.636 --> 27:34.501
I'd be a couch potato.

27:37.508 --> 27:38.668
Jeremy?

27:38.742 --> 27:39.709
Hmm?

27:40.010 --> 27:41.978
You're sitting on my lap.

27:42.179 --> 27:43.339
I know.

27:45.716 --> 27:47.240
It feels nice.

27:50.988 --> 27:52.148
Jeremy.

27:54.725 --> 27:56.784
Don't do that again, okay?

27:59.229 --> 28:00.753
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:22.152 --> 28:23.449
Damn it.

28:24.888 --> 28:25.946
God.

28:27.524 --> 28:28.684
Clark?

28:30.727 --> 28:31.887
Clark?

28:32.362 --> 28:33.795
Is that you?

28:44.975 --> 28:47.466
All right,
who wants a candy cane?

28:58.021 --> 28:59.181
Hey, dad, where's mom?

28:59.256 --> 29:01.588
She couldn't make it.
She got hung up at the gallery.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.182
Too bad for her.

29:03.260 --> 29:06.195
This is, like, a once-in-a-lifetime
experience here.

29:06.263 --> 29:08.390
Not really. They do it every year.

29:08.465 --> 29:10.296
Wow. Really?

29:10.367 --> 29:11.425
Yup.

29:11.902 --> 29:13.870
I have to marry into this family.

29:13.971 --> 29:17.532
Well, Kiki, I'm not sure that's
the right attitude to be cultivating.

29:18.642 --> 29:20.542
You don't hate ballets, do you?

29:20.611 --> 29:22.306
This isn't gonna drive you away?

29:22.379 --> 29:24.813
No. No, this is interesting.

29:24.882 --> 29:27.646
We definitely don't have anything
like this where I come from.

29:27.718 --> 29:30.346
Good. I can't wait to see you see it.

29:34.825 --> 29:36.520
Hey, what are you doing here?

29:36.593 --> 29:37.821
Nothing.

29:38.896 --> 29:40.261
Sit down.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.959
- Karen, you okay?
- I'm fine.

29:46.336 --> 29:47.701
Something happen
between you and Simon?

29:47.771 --> 29:49.204
I don't want to talk about it.

29:49.273 --> 29:52.106
- Karen, you can tell me.
- Nothing happened.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.074
All right.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.381
That has to be the prettiest dress
on earth.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.781
Thank you.

30:02.219 --> 30:04.244
Good evening, everybody.

30:04.321 --> 30:06.289
Shall we start the show?

30:40.185 --> 30:42.449
Mrs. glass, you're here to
see your big blue sponge?

30:42.521 --> 30:44.614
- I am.
- It's really big.

30:44.723 --> 30:45.815
May I touch it?

30:45.891 --> 30:48.155
Of course. It's yours. Almost.

30:52.331 --> 30:54.162
Oh, my God. It reeks.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.601
Oh, no, no.
That's the thai food we had last night.

30:57.669 --> 30:59.134
- We?
- Me. A wee bit of thai food. Sorry.

30:59.169 --> 31:00.600
- We?
- Me. A wee bit of thai food. Sorry.

31:00.639 --> 31:02.004
It's marijuana.

31:02.107 --> 31:03.631
I would know that smell anywhere.

31:03.709 --> 31:05.836
I had a stoner husband for four years

31:05.911 --> 31:08.880
and this is what everything
smelled like, all the time.

31:08.947 --> 31:10.505
This and patchouli.

31:10.616 --> 31:11.844
Oh, God.

31:13.118 --> 31:15.052
It is. It's pot, isn't it?

31:15.120 --> 31:17.486
I'm sure if someone did smoke pot
near the sponge,

31:17.556 --> 31:19.387
the smell wouldn't be
absorbed permanently, ma'am.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.584
It's a sponge.

31:20.659 --> 31:22.684
Absorbing is what they do.

31:22.995 --> 31:23.962
Alex, please!

31:24.062 --> 31:25.393
Mrs. glass, I'm sure there's
something we can do.

31:25.464 --> 31:29.833
No, no, no. I don't want that thing!
It smells and it reminds me of Hugh.

31:29.901 --> 31:31.061
Well...

31:38.610 --> 31:42.273
Well, you just killed a $ 150,000 sale.

31:42.347 --> 31:43.712
I'm sorry.

31:44.783 --> 31:46.944
No, you're not. You're fired.

31:50.055 --> 31:51.579
You sleep okay?

31:52.491 --> 31:53.981
In and out.

31:54.059 --> 31:55.549
Had an espresso at 10:00 last night,

31:55.627 --> 31:57.788
made my brain a little jumpy.

31:58.430 --> 32:00.091
Silly thing to do.

32:00.232 --> 32:01.392
Are you okay?

32:01.500 --> 32:03.627
Are you settling in to us?

32:04.536 --> 32:05.798
Sure I am. Yeah.

32:05.871 --> 32:08.101
I am grateful for all of this.

32:08.173 --> 32:11.336
All of you, that you're
still willing to give me.

32:22.954 --> 32:24.444
It's Clarkie.

32:24.856 --> 32:26.346
He's calling.

32:26.558 --> 32:27.889
Hey, Clarkie, what's cooking?

32:27.959 --> 32:30.427
Sir, you need to come over here.

32:30.495 --> 32:32.190
What's the matter?

32:32.631 --> 32:34.189
It's Carmelita, sir.

32:34.266 --> 32:37.201
I don't know how it happened,
but she's gone.

32:39.004 --> 32:40.369
Okay, well,

32:41.039 --> 32:44.133
thanks for calling, Clark.
I'll get right on it.

32:44.543 --> 32:45.703
Right.

32:52.351 --> 32:54.512
It's fingernail Polish, sir.

32:54.619 --> 32:57.144
It seems he, or she,

32:57.222 --> 32:58.917
came in through the bathroom window,

32:58.990 --> 33:00.651
went straight into the bedroom

33:00.726 --> 33:02.694
and waited there to seize Carmelita.

33:03.395 --> 33:05.955
They managed to elude the ficus.

33:08.734 --> 33:10.031
Clarkie,

33:11.336 --> 33:13.201
how could this happen?

33:14.072 --> 33:16.302
I'm sorry, sir. I am.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.041
Me, too.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.115
She's gone.

33:36.762 --> 33:38.320
Well, look at you.

33:38.430 --> 33:39.658
What a beautiful suit.

33:39.765 --> 33:41.699
Yeah, it was in my closet.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.291
How's it feel?

33:43.402 --> 33:46.530
- You know, like a uniform.
- Well, I'll give you some suspenders.

33:46.605 --> 33:48.573
It'll take the edge off.

33:50.776 --> 33:51.868
So...

33:52.611 --> 33:53.839
Speak.

33:55.113 --> 33:57.479
Well, last night I did some thinking.

33:57.549 --> 33:58.675
And?

33:58.750 --> 34:00.615
I wasn't able to come
to any conclusion.

34:00.685 --> 34:02.550
Every time I imagined
leaving the church,

34:02.621 --> 34:04.714
I got so anxious I realized
I had to go back.

34:04.790 --> 34:07.020
Every time I imagined staying,

34:07.793 --> 34:10.659
I felt so trapped
I realized I had to leave.

34:11.463 --> 34:14.591
Well, that sounds like a hard way
to spend an evening.

34:14.666 --> 34:16.690
It's a hard way to spend a life.

34:17.735 --> 34:20.101
Yeah, but that's over now, right?

34:22.107 --> 34:23.266
Yeah.

34:24.109 --> 34:26.804
And after I thought about it
for a long time,

34:26.878 --> 34:28.607
I stopped thinking,

34:28.847 --> 34:30.474
and I prayed.

34:30.549 --> 34:32.710
And did you get your answer?

34:32.784 --> 34:34.513
Yeah, I did.

34:34.585 --> 34:35.951
From God?

34:36.554 --> 34:37.920
I think so.

34:39.558 --> 34:40.786
What did

34:42.828 --> 34:44.659
he/she have to say?

34:45.730 --> 34:48.062
I'd like to come work for you.

34:48.733 --> 34:50.792
I think it's best for me,

34:51.536 --> 34:53.663
and for Darling enterprises.

34:54.706 --> 34:56.867
This is God talking, right?

34:56.942 --> 34:58.307
Not your mother.

34:58.376 --> 35:00.674
She doesn't even know I'm here.

35:01.213 --> 35:02.441
Well...

35:05.150 --> 35:07.380
Far be it from me to ignore

35:08.520 --> 35:11.216
the still small voice of the lord.

35:17.329 --> 35:19.490
Welcome to the company, son.

35:20.499 --> 35:21.932
Thank you.

35:43.750 --> 35:44.978
Nick.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.777
Did we have a meeting?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.684
I just need a minute.

35:50.156 --> 35:51.487
It's okay.

35:52.526 --> 35:53.891
What's going on?
You seem like something's...

35:53.960 --> 35:56.121
I don't know what happened
between you and Karen last night

35:56.196 --> 35:57.561
and I don't wanna know,

35:57.664 --> 36:00.531
but I am telling you
to stay away from her.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.699
Why?
Now, I knew she was upset about...

36:03.770 --> 36:05.260
I said I don't wanna know.

36:05.338 --> 36:06.896
There is a city full of women,

36:06.973 --> 36:08.941
a world full of women out there
for you, Simon.

36:09.009 --> 36:10.704
Why her?
You can have any woman you want.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.211
Now, if you care about
our business relationship at all,

36:13.280 --> 36:15.145
if you've been sincere with me
about your intentions,

36:15.215 --> 36:16.375
your vision for the city,

36:16.483 --> 36:19.350
and if you're not just in this to
destroy the Darlings, let her go.

36:19.419 --> 36:21.853
- Did Tripp send you to say this?
- No.

36:21.922 --> 36:24.015
This is between you and me.

36:25.125 --> 36:26.149
You are a married man...

36:26.226 --> 36:28.888
Simon, that is not what this is about.

36:30.564 --> 36:31.929
Let her go.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.762
All right, I'll let her go.

36:34.868 --> 36:36.233
Thank you.

36:37.370 --> 36:38.667
Five years.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.569
Financial statements.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.679
- This is incredible.
- No, it's not.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.238
It's business.

36:55.121 --> 36:57.385
Well, it kind of looks like me.

36:59.693 --> 37:01.854
- Maybe if I squint?
- Okay. All right.

37:01.962 --> 37:05.591
Sofia, I need to tell you something
right now, because...

37:06.533 --> 37:08.592
I don't want my insides to die

37:08.668 --> 37:10.533
any more than they already have.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.037
What? You're sick?

37:12.105 --> 37:14.869
No. No, no, no.
I'm sick of lying.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.603
Sofia, I'm not a painter.

37:17.677 --> 37:19.338
I didn't paint any of these.

37:19.412 --> 37:20.709
I mean, I did do this sketch,

37:20.780 --> 37:23.408
which is why it really sucks, but...

37:25.085 --> 37:27.178
What are you talking about?

37:28.288 --> 37:30.813
I lied to you about everything.

37:30.890 --> 37:33.051
I bought all these paintings

37:33.893 --> 37:35.861
and I pretended that they were mine

37:35.929 --> 37:37.624
so that you'd think I was a poor artist

37:37.697 --> 37:39.597
and not some rich lazy ass,

37:39.666 --> 37:40.963
which is actually what I am.

37:41.034 --> 37:42.763
Because, Sofia,
my last name isn't Babeson.

37:42.836 --> 37:44.303
It's Darling.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.804
My family is worth $35 billion.

37:50.243 --> 37:51.608
Am I supposed to believe this?

37:51.711 --> 37:52.871
I know! It's crazy!

37:52.979 --> 37:54.344
But, you see, I wanted to make sure

37:54.447 --> 37:56.881
that you liked me
before you knew the truth.

37:56.950 --> 38:00.386
I have suffered too much at the hands
of these love pirates.

38:00.453 --> 38:01.943
Sofia, now that you know who I am,

38:02.022 --> 38:04.252
you can love me for what I am, right?

38:04.324 --> 38:05.814
I trusted you.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.383
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm so sorry.

38:08.461 --> 38:09.689
I'm sorry.

38:09.763 --> 38:12.425
You think because you tell me
the truth, it's gonna be okay?

38:12.499 --> 38:14.399
That's not the way to treat people.

38:14.467 --> 38:17.732
I don't care who you are,
how much money you have.

38:18.438 --> 38:21.066
Bye, Jeremy Babeson,

38:21.841 --> 38:23.274
or whatever.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.078
I have something to tell you.

38:31.551 --> 38:34.850
Last night, I was sitting with you
and your family

38:34.921 --> 38:36.946
and I realized something.

38:37.223 --> 38:38.383
I want to stay here.

38:38.458 --> 38:39.516
You are staying here.

38:39.592 --> 38:41.719
No. I mean, indefinitely.

38:43.063 --> 38:44.223
What about your Uncle?

38:44.297 --> 38:45.958
Oh, I e-mailed him last night. It's okay.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.933
He's cool.
He has, like, nine other nephews.

38:50.236 --> 38:52.534
Oh, this is the best day ever!

38:52.605 --> 38:55.472
Okay, well, we have to go shopping
before we do anything else.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.407
- For what?
- Warm clothes.

38:57.477 --> 38:59.843
It's cold outside and
you're not totally acclimated yet.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.436
- Juliet.
- What?

39:01.614 --> 39:03.104
I didn't come here from the Seychelles

39:03.183 --> 39:04.343
for you to take care of me

39:04.451 --> 39:06.180
like some kind of poodle, okay?

39:06.252 --> 39:08.277
- I know.
- I came because...

39:11.057 --> 39:12.820
I came for you. Okay?

39:16.129 --> 39:17.687
- Kai?
- Yes?

39:19.432 --> 39:20.456
Can I give you one gift?

39:20.533 --> 39:22.558
No, I just said no gifts.

39:24.771 --> 39:26.033
I want...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.099
I want you to be my first.

39:31.010 --> 39:32.375
Your first?

39:33.012 --> 39:34.274
You know.

39:35.281 --> 39:36.543
My first.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.282
Tonight?

39:40.353 --> 39:41.615
Whenever.

39:42.822 --> 39:44.790
But I want it to be you.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.420
Juliet.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.786
You're amazing.

39:59.672 --> 40:01.572
I'll take one of those.

40:01.708 --> 40:02.800
Hey.

40:03.777 --> 40:06.109
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

40:09.716 --> 40:11.377
I got fired today.

40:11.751 --> 40:13.241
- What?
- Yeah.

40:13.887 --> 40:15.047
Cheers.

40:16.055 --> 40:17.215
Cheers.

40:24.097 --> 40:25.962
Well, you want to tell me
what happened?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.056
It was stupid.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.430
When Jeremy came
to the gallery yesterday,

40:28.501 --> 40:30.128
he smoked pot
and the smoke permeated

40:30.203 --> 40:32.330
this giant blue German sponge.

40:32.405 --> 40:35.465
And a lady was gonna buy it and
she freaked out and changed her mind.

40:35.542 --> 40:36.668
Oops.

40:39.846 --> 40:40.938
Okay.

40:43.917 --> 40:46.283
And did you do it, too? Get high?

40:46.486 --> 40:47.612
Yeah.

40:49.122 --> 40:50.282
I did.

40:51.791 --> 40:52.951
I see.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.687
Maybe I wanted something
bad to happen,

40:56.162 --> 40:59.029
to just shake things up.

41:00.133 --> 41:02.158
Well, inviting the Darlings
into any situation

41:02.235 --> 41:06.001
definitely increases the chances
of things getting shaken up.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.974
Now you know how I feel.

41:11.377 --> 41:12.537
Do I?

41:14.480 --> 41:15.606
Yeah.

41:16.883 --> 41:18.350
Yeah, you do.

41:19.986 --> 41:21.510
I'm sorry I'm unemployed.

41:21.588 --> 41:24.113
It's okay. We got plenty of money.

41:25.992 --> 41:28.085
You wanna have another kid?

41:31.698 --> 41:33.188
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:40.740 --> 41:42.105
I love you.

41:43.810 --> 41:45.368
I love you, too.

41:45.612 --> 41:47.375
- You all right?
- Yeah.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.979
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.681
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, Darling.

41:56.789 --> 41:58.757
You wanted to talk to me?

41:59.592 --> 42:00.684
Yeah.

42:03.663 --> 42:06.188
We're not in over our heads
with this thing, are we?

42:06.266 --> 42:07.631
What thing?

42:08.434 --> 42:10.197
You and Simon elder.

42:10.737 --> 42:11.999
You okay?

42:12.772 --> 42:15.297
Yeah. I'm fine. What... you don't...

42:15.375 --> 42:16.467
Don't worry about that.

42:16.542 --> 42:19.602
You promise me you're not getting
emotionally involved?

42:19.679 --> 42:20.907
I'm not.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.305
I promise.

42:22.382 --> 42:26.079
Because we agreed that was absolutely
not part of the plan.

42:28.910 --> 42:30.022
I know.
