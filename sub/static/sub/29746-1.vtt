00:35.834 --> 00:36.869
Hmph.

00:42.141 --> 00:43.807
<i>Welcome to Zombieland.</i>

00:45.979 --> 00:48.779
<i>Back for seconds?
After all this time?</i>

00:48.781 --> 00:50.514
<i>Well, what can I say,
but thank you.</i>

00:50.516 --> 00:51.983
<i>You have a lot of choices</i>

00:51.985 --> 00:53.852
<i>when it comes to
zombie entertainment,</i>

00:53.854 --> 00:55.487
<i>and we appreciate
you picking us.</i>

00:55.489 --> 00:56.953
<i>So you know how Eskimos</i>

00:56.955 --> 00:58.990
<i>have a bunch of words for snow?</i>

01:02.762 --> 01:05.361
<i>The only reason we've survived
the last several years</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:07.764
<i>is we've gotten to know
our bloodthirsty enemies</i>

01:07.766 --> 01:09.301
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

01:09.303 --> 01:11.034
<i>In the time since
we last saw you,</i>

01:11.036 --> 01:12.770
<i>zombies have evolved,</i>

01:12.772 --> 01:14.504
<i>so we've given them
different names.</i>

01:15.908 --> 01:17.674
<i>This lady here
is getting chased</i>

01:17.676 --> 01:20.844
<i>by the dumbest Z there is,
what we call a Homer.</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:25.248
<i>In a world without YouTube,</i>

01:25.250 --> 01:26.885
<i>who isn't entertained
by a Homer?</i>

01:30.223 --> 01:31.158
<i>D'oh!</i>

01:41.366 --> 01:43.734
<i>Unfortunately, for every Homer,</i>

01:43.736 --> 01:47.037
<i>there's a Hawking,
as in Stephen.</i>

01:47.039 --> 01:49.874
<i>Or maybe his slightly less
accomplished sister, Beatrix,</i>

01:49.876 --> 01:51.909
<i>who's still got some brains
left to figure shit out.</i>

01:51.911 --> 01:52.942
Open, open!

02:15.667 --> 02:16.766
<i>Clever girl.</i>

02:19.071 --> 02:20.639
<i>Okay. Last one.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?</i>

02:23.910 --> 02:25.543
<i>Okay, all right.
Well, this time,</i>

02:25.545 --> 02:27.613
<i>let's play Name That Zombie.</i>

02:28.714 --> 02:29.682
Hello?

02:32.451 --> 02:33.486
Hello?

02:39.458 --> 02:42.425
<i>The Ninja. Silent, deadly.</i>

02:42.427 --> 02:44.896
<i>The first thing you hear
is your own scream.</i>

02:52.738 --> 02:57.442
<i>You can imagine how thrilled we
were to crack the zombie code.</i>

02:57.444 --> 03:01.444
<i>But life is about more
than just survival.</i>

03:01.446 --> 03:04.048
<i>Ever since we were evicted
from our normal lives,</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:07.651
<i>I'd been searching for a place
to put down roots.</i>

03:07.653 --> 03:12.590
<i>My old pal Tallahassee has this
saying, "Go big or go home."</i>

03:12.592 --> 03:15.928
<i>It's not his signature phrase,
but it did give me an idea.</i>

03:16.995 --> 03:18.332
<i>Why not go big...</i>

03:19.432 --> 03:20.765
<i>and go home?</i>

<i>There are worse places</i>

05:07.540 --> 05:08.906
<i>to hang your hat.</i>

05:08.908 --> 05:10.742
<i>Casa Blanca.</i>

05:10.744 --> 05:13.543
Wait, why does he get
to be president?

05:13.545 --> 05:15.947
I would have made
a damn fine president.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.249
Kissed a few hands,
shook a few babies.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.851
You would have brought
a real dignity to the office.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.786
- Thank you.
- You don't have what it takes.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.221
- I'll be president.
- Heh!

05:24.223 --> 05:26.456
And I nominate Little Rock
as my VP.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.425
So that means
I get to be president

05:28.427 --> 05:29.995
if you get killed by zombies.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.661
That wasn't
what I was thinking

05:31.663 --> 05:34.232
when I offered you
the position, but yes.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.800
<i>I have this rule:</i>

05:36.802 --> 05:38.435
<i>Enjoy the little things.</i>

05:38.437 --> 05:40.536
<i>Which is what we spent
a lot of time doing</i>

05:40.538 --> 05:42.439
<i>in those early days
at the White House.</i>

05:42.441 --> 05:44.074
<i>And it was a really
special time,</i>

05:44.076 --> 05:45.643
<i>making a house our home.</i>

05:47.747 --> 05:51.115
<i>♪ Happy birthday to... ♪</i>

05:51.117 --> 05:54.485
Shooting up, not to.
All right. Nice!

05:58.090 --> 06:01.658
<i>Wichita and I fell into
our own version of domestic bliss.</i>

06:01.660 --> 06:05.764
<i>Well, not quite bliss,
but domesticity to be sure.</i>

06:05.766 --> 06:07.497
Did Abe's blindfold
fall off again?

06:07.499 --> 06:09.533
No, it did not fall off.
I took it off.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.802
It's so creepy.
He stares at us all night.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.670
That stare emancipated
the slaves,

06:13.672 --> 06:15.173
and ended the Civil War.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.175
We should be grateful
he's gawking at us.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.843
Remember what happened the last
time you took the blindfold off?

06:19.845 --> 06:21.946
You made me sleep
on the Lincoln couch?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.316
Mm-hm.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.021
- Is that better?
- Much better.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.488
Good.

06:32.490 --> 06:35.326
<i>I love you so much, baby.</i>

06:35.328 --> 06:38.995
You are so gorgeous.

06:38.997 --> 06:41.165
We really need
to find you someone.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.966
That's where you're wrong.

06:42.968 --> 06:45.870
Any romance left in me
belongs to the Beast here.

06:45.872 --> 06:49.175
Okay. Well, then we need
to find someone for me.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.444
Heh, heh, heh,
shouldn't be a problem,

06:53.446 --> 06:55.480
long as you're open
to dating zombies.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.649
So you're saying what? I'm
never gonna find a boyfriend,

06:58.651 --> 07:00.851
or get married, have a family?

07:00.853 --> 07:05.723
We're you family, so one
out of three ain't bad.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.692
<i>Little Rock had a
strong desire to leave the nest.</i>

07:08.694 --> 07:10.427
<i>And let's just say Tallahassee</i>

07:10.429 --> 07:12.663
<i>wasn't the most understanding
father figure.</i>

07:12.665 --> 07:13.964
Little Rock!

07:13.966 --> 07:15.398
<i>But for better or worse,</i>

07:15.400 --> 07:16.867
<i>we were a family.</i>

07:16.869 --> 07:18.802
<i>And for the first time
since the virus,</i>

07:18.804 --> 07:20.737
<i>we were living somewhere
truly safe,</i>

07:20.739 --> 07:23.910
<i>making every day feel like...
Well, like Christmas morning.</i>

07:25.211 --> 07:27.948
Hello? Ho-ho-ho!

07:29.047 --> 07:30.615
Merry Christmas!

07:30.617 --> 07:33.283
- Hey, Tal.
- Santa.

07:33.285 --> 07:36.187
What would you like for
Christmas, little girl? A pony?

07:36.189 --> 07:39.023
I'd like you to stop calling me
"little girl."

07:39.025 --> 07:42.259
Well, technically, you are
little and you're a girl.

07:42.261 --> 07:46.062
I am not a little girl, but
do you know what I would like?

07:46.064 --> 07:48.333
I don't give a fuck
what you'd like.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.401
<i>Not to
sound too sentimental,</i>

07:50.403 --> 07:53.069
<i>but those days
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</i>

07:53.071 --> 07:55.339
<i>may have been the best days
of my life,</i>

07:55.341 --> 07:57.076
<i>and that's counting pre-Z.</i>

07:59.078 --> 08:01.045
Wait a second.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.413
Oh, my God. No.

08:03.415 --> 08:06.917
A first-edition Tolkien,
and you wrote in it.

08:06.919 --> 08:10.053
There's my name, marring this
perfectly preserved paper.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.721
Thank you. And yours too.

08:11.723 --> 08:14.893
You didn't stop.
Thank you so much.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.927
It's a bit touching.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.396
Hey, you know, I couldn't
find any wrapping paper,

08:19.398 --> 08:21.632
but don't worry about it.
Just tear it open.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.268
It doesn't matter.
It's only Taft.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.704
He was our fattest president,
so there's a lot left over

08:27.706 --> 08:29.706
if you need some wrapping paper.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.010
Columbus, I didn't get
anything from you.

08:33.413 --> 08:36.179
Just what I wanted.
Another gun.

08:36.181 --> 08:40.317
Oh, hey, well, not just any gun.
A Colt .45.

08:40.318 --> 08:44.154
And not just any Colt .45.
The King's.

08:44.155 --> 08:48.292
- England? Denmark? Lichtenstein?
- There's only one king.

08:48.294 --> 08:52.332
Elvis Aaron fucking Presley,
the greatest who ever lived.

08:53.365 --> 08:55.099
The king of kings.

08:55.101 --> 08:58.269
He gave this gun to Nixon
when he visited the White House,

08:58.271 --> 09:02.240
and I give it to you,
locked and loaded.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.676
Yeah, he used to shoot
that Colt in his backyard.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.610
King's palace,
Memphis, Tennessee.

09:07.612 --> 09:10.081
- I tell you about Graceland?
- Only a hundred times.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.816
We'll go there
together someday.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.085
Actually, I'm gonna go
shoot this right now.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.288
I think I saw some Zs
down by the reflecting pool.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.023
- I'll go with.
- I'll go by myself.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.625
- It's Christmas.
- It's not fucking Christmas.

09:21.627 --> 09:22.661
It's November 17th.

09:24.663 --> 09:27.030
<i>Little Rock was on the
hunt, all right,</i>

09:27.032 --> 09:28.599
<i>for people her own age.</i>

09:28.601 --> 09:30.467
<i>And the thing is,
they were out there.</i>

09:30.469 --> 09:32.836
<i>We just made it a point
to keep our distance.</i>

09:32.838 --> 09:35.507
<i>Which would suck if you
were the one stuck in the nest.</i>

09:37.977 --> 09:42.913
God, this is really terrifying,
but totally unrealistic.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.481
Hm...

09:44.483 --> 09:45.684
Hey, she'll be fine.

09:47.319 --> 09:49.887
Wish she didn't remind me
so much of me.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.655
Hey, come on.
What's wrong with you?

09:53.859 --> 09:54.894
Nothing.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.865
All right.
I wasn't gonna do this now.

10:01.867 --> 10:06.637
Okay. Look, you always say that,
like, I play it too safe,

10:06.639 --> 10:09.873
and I know we've been in,
like, a bit of a rut lately.

10:09.875 --> 10:14.214
So I thought, what better way
to spice things up than to...

10:18.883 --> 10:20.583
Get married?

10:20.585 --> 10:23.153
Yeah, well, I was gonna
say, "Get married!" Yay!

10:23.155 --> 10:26.023
- Is that the Hope diamond?
- I certainly <i>hope</i> it is.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.558
I want you to be Miss Ohio.
Or I guess Mrs. Ohio.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.927
This is unfair.
You know how I feel about this.

10:30.929 --> 10:32.562
- What?
- We've talked about this.

10:32.564 --> 10:35.600
In my limited, but absurdly
painful experience,

10:35.602 --> 10:37.734
married people only do
one thing.

10:37.736 --> 10:40.604
- What, fight? We already do that.
- Get divorced.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.373
I don't see us going that route.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.541
I mean, where would
we find the lawyers?

10:44.543 --> 10:49.580
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, don't say anything. Yet.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.950
- Okay? This was my fault.
- I put you on the spot.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.485
Just think about it, and let me
know whenever you're ready.

10:56.487 --> 10:59.525
Everything will work out
exactly as it's supposed to.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.475
Hey, Buttercup. What's wrong?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.110
Get a little too much eggnog
last night?

11:20.112 --> 11:22.712
- Bad news.
- Bad news?

11:22.714 --> 11:26.149
Well, you know what cancels out
bad news? Good news.

11:26.151 --> 11:28.384
Today is the day
that Wichita says...

11:28.386 --> 11:29.787
Adios.

11:29.789 --> 11:30.824
Hm?

11:34.093 --> 11:38.596
"Dear C and T, we feel
like total shit about leaving.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.800
Sorry, not good at notes.
W and LR."

11:42.267 --> 11:44.201
Well, yeah.
"Not good at notes"

11:44.203 --> 11:46.139
is a pretty huge understatement.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.307
He's gonna take
this Beast thing pretty hard.

11:50.309 --> 11:53.543
Well, he should learn
to not get so attached.

11:53.545 --> 11:55.346
Never get attached.
Remember?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.047
That was the problem
with Columbus,

11:57.049 --> 11:58.282
he got too attached.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.884
Well, with Tallahassee,
it's like

11:59.886 --> 12:01.451
- he thinks he's my dad.
- Sure.

12:01.453 --> 12:03.653
But you are lucky
you don't have a boyfriend.

12:03.655 --> 12:05.789
Have you seen him
use Q-tips?

12:05.791 --> 12:08.457
His bedtime routine
took an hour.

12:08.459 --> 12:10.327
- Stop.
- What? God, sorry.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.596
- No, stop! Stop!
- Oh!

12:18.938 --> 12:19.905
Namaste.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.575
Hi.

12:26.444 --> 12:29.712
<i>Wichita leaving
hit me like a shotgun blast.</i>

12:29.714 --> 12:32.282
<i>So after weeks of feeling sorry
for myself,</i>

12:32.284 --> 12:33.951
<i>I thought a little
retail therapy</i>

12:33.953 --> 12:35.485
<i>might help get her
off my mind.</i>

12:35.487 --> 12:37.453
It's not like
I wanted to start,

12:37.455 --> 12:40.191
wedding planning or anything.
I'm not crazy.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.759
Who wants to get married
in winter? Spring, sure.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.162
- Though my hair and humidity...
- Oh, my God!

12:45.164 --> 12:48.231
Man, I cannot listen
to this shit anymore.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.434
- My God, it's been over a month.
- Yeah, I'm bereft.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.538
Okay, I'm giving you
one more day to mope around,

12:54.540 --> 12:57.442
and then you gotta snap
the fuck out of it.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.445
This whole "finding a home" idea
of yours has made us soft.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.748
And by us, I mean you.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.716
It's high time that we nut up
and hit the road again.

13:06.718 --> 13:07.850
And by we, I mean me.

13:07.852 --> 13:09.119
That's where I belong.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.389
On my own. Lone wolf.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.057
- You're welcome to tag along.
- But when they come back,

13:14.059 --> 13:16.226
- we won't be here.
- They're never coming back!

13:20.565 --> 13:21.664
I got it.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.433
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:24.435 --> 13:26.205
Okay. Uh...

13:31.242 --> 13:33.711
It was good. You shot
your alcohol with your gun.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.558
Not bad, huh?

13:48.560 --> 13:52.663
Hm, no. Not bad,
but definitely no ZKOTY.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.299
<i>ZKOTY,
that is "Zombie Kill of the Year."</i>

13:56.301 --> 13:58.668
<i>Like a junkie in search
of a higher high,</i>

13:58.670 --> 14:01.638
<i>Tallahassee is no longer happy
with Zombie Kill of the Week.</i>

14:01.640 --> 14:03.407
<i>Which, if you're keeping score,</i>

14:03.409 --> 14:05.743
<i>just went to Dave Sanderman
of Riverside, Iowa.</i>

14:05.745 --> 14:08.177
<i>You may wanna set down
the Milk Duds for this one.</i>

14:08.179 --> 14:09.513
You dead, zombie!

14:12.251 --> 14:13.616
Whoo-whee, pig!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.589
<i>Congratulations, Dave.</i>

14:18.591 --> 14:20.256
I never told you this before.

14:20.258 --> 14:22.626
In fact, I never told anybody.

14:22.628 --> 14:29.232
But I have Native American blood
coursing through my veins.

14:29.234 --> 14:33.669
- Like, right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

14:33.671 --> 14:38.442
Blackfoot Indian to be exact.
The freest men in history.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.110
Mid-1800s, roamed the plains,

14:41.112 --> 14:44.447
no houses, no laws,
no possessions,

14:44.449 --> 14:48.152
no chiefs to report to,
no wives to listen to.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.255
They listened...

14:50.555 --> 14:52.556
to the call of the buffalo.

14:53.791 --> 14:55.325
And they hunted
those buffalo

14:55.327 --> 15:00.732
by herding them off the cliff
to their deaths.

15:02.133 --> 15:07.037
- The great buffalo jump.
- Whoa.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.907
I don't know why I never told
anyone about my Blackfoot blood.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.644
I guess it's
a sacred little secret.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.346
Honestly, you're
the first paleface

15:16.348 --> 15:18.181
I have genuinely trusted

15:18.183 --> 15:20.350
because you've always
been there for me.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.818
You care and you listen.
You really listen...

15:22.820 --> 15:24.721
<i>Unless
you're in a 4D theater,</i>

15:24.723 --> 15:26.956
<i>there is no way
I can communicate</i>

15:26.958 --> 15:28.392
<i>how bad Z-land smells,</i>

15:28.394 --> 15:30.827
<i>which is why I like candles
so much.</i>

15:30.829 --> 15:32.830
<i>Today, maybe
a frosty gingerbread</i>

15:32.832 --> 15:34.398
<i>or a Bahama breeze.</i>

15:34.400 --> 15:35.698
Mmm.

15:36.801 --> 15:38.302
Whoa!

15:38.304 --> 15:41.738
Oh, my God! Please forgive me.
It's fake fur!

15:41.740 --> 15:44.073
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I thought you were a...

15:44.075 --> 15:46.243
- You thought I was a zombie?
- Yeah. Of course.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.111
Oh, my God, no.
I don't even eat meat.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.115
I'm a vegetarian.
Vegan, actually. Heh.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.918
- Sorry. Hi, I'm Columbus.
- Madison. Heh-heh.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.387
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.057
All right. We're hugging.
So soon. Nice to meet you.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.426
It's nice
to touch a human.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.894
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, hello.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.629
If I can have my body?
Hi, sorry.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.464
This is Tallahassee.
This is Madison.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.234
- Madison, Tallahassee.
- Is this your dad?

16:10.236 --> 16:14.705
For shit's sake, slightly older,
better-looking friend.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.972
- Ha, ha, cute.
- You live here?

16:16.974 --> 16:21.412
No, Paul Blart. I live in the
freezer in Pinkberry, mm-hm.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.681
It keeps the zombies out,
though it is awfully chilly.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.251
Do you ever consider
turning it off?

16:28.253 --> 16:30.421
Couldn't find the switch
anywhere.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.522
Just hoping the electricity
would run out.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.592
It's amazing. As long as it
rains, the dams give us power.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.162
Apparently not brain power.

16:39.564 --> 16:41.465
I feel like
you're being super judgy.

16:41.467 --> 16:45.469
Like, I'm getting
a real anti-me vibe off of you.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.437
- Are you?
- Oh, my God. There it was again.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.605
- Yeah, I saw it.
- And that's hurtful, okay?

16:49.607 --> 16:51.807
I'm, like, really good
at surviving.

16:51.809 --> 16:54.177
I carry a can of mace
with me everywhere I go.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.679
And I can run really, really,
really, really fast.

16:56.681 --> 16:59.417
Probably because I used to do
hot yoga and SoulCycle.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.586
Cardio! Sorry, I do
a lot of cardio too.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.922
It's actually my number one
rule, which is so dorky.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.592
But I have a list of rules
for surviving Zombieland.

17:08.594 --> 17:09.626
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.493
- So do I!
- You have rules

17:11.496 --> 17:13.829
- for surviving Zombieland?
- Mine is just mostly

17:13.830 --> 17:15.598
- stay in the freezer.
- Oh.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.434
You know, we set up camp,

17:18.435 --> 17:20.435
like, down the road
at the White House.

17:21.772 --> 17:23.307
The White House?
Oh, my God.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.839
Would you wanna come hang out?

17:24.842 --> 17:26.644
- I would love that.
- Cool.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.612
Okay. How many rules
do you have?

17:28.614 --> 17:31.748
- You wanna know about my rules?
- I wanna hear all of them.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.085
- Well, number two is double tap.
- Double tap.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.988
- Double tap, yes.
- Double tap you.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.691
- You got me. I'm murdered.
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.125
<i>Okay, yeah,
I know what you're thinking.</i>

17:43.127 --> 17:44.862
<i>She's absolutely not my type.</i>

17:44.864 --> 17:46.762
<i>But after Wichita
broke my heart,</i>

17:46.764 --> 17:48.766
<i>I was just excited
to talk to somebody</i>

17:48.768 --> 17:51.669
<i>who smelled like a candle,
and not whiskey and gunpowder.</i>

17:51.671 --> 17:53.336
So Wichita and
Little Rock left.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.838
It was just us guys again.
You know, bachelors.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.407
This guy. You know,
making a mess.

17:58.409 --> 18:02.913
Which actually brings me
to rule number 53, Wet-Naps.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.749
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.684
I can't believe that you keep
all this stuff in your head.

18:08.686 --> 18:09.752
Heh, thank you.

18:09.754 --> 18:11.422
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.823
- You know, you're really lucky.
- What?

18:13.825 --> 18:17.827
That you found someone so smart
to take care of you.

18:17.829 --> 18:21.265
Most people your age,
they get left all by themselves,

18:21.267 --> 18:23.400
and that can be so sad.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.869
- Yeah. I am so lucky.
- Oh!

18:28.473 --> 18:30.907
Can we have a little summit
in the Oval Office?

18:30.909 --> 18:31.974
Yeah, sure.

18:31.976 --> 18:33.710
You guys, I can't believe

18:33.712 --> 18:37.480
we're in the White House.
This is soy random.

18:37.482 --> 18:40.483
You got to broom this girl.
You know why she's still alive?

18:40.485 --> 18:43.721
Because zombies eat brains,
and she ain't got any!

18:43.723 --> 18:45.255
All right? It doesn't matter

18:45.257 --> 18:47.391
because I'm hitting
the road come sunup.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.991
- Columbus?
- Yes?

18:48.993 --> 18:50.760
Could you maybe give me a tour?

18:50.762 --> 18:54.230
Whoa, this is the Oval Office.

18:54.232 --> 18:56.032
Why do they call it that?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.202
- You ready?
- You ready?

19:00.204 --> 19:01.604
- I'm ready too.
- I'm ready.

19:01.606 --> 19:02.575
- Great.
- Too.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.477
- Let's go.
- He's kind of funny.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.578
Yeah, he's great.
Try not to speak to him.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.779
Okay.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.815
The main attraction.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.450
Ta-da, the Lincoln bedroom.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.885
Believe it or not,
Lincoln never even slept here.

19:15.887 --> 19:18.454
I didn't actually
want a tour, silly.

19:18.456 --> 19:20.156
- What? Oh.
- Hi.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.458
Hi.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.726
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.161
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

19:25.163 --> 19:28.031
- Don't you think that I'm pretty?
- Yes, you're very pretty.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.901
You're like, "Girl
in Apartment 406" pretty.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.135
I just... I feel
kind of guilty.

19:33.137 --> 19:35.739
Because of Jesus?

19:35.741 --> 19:37.343
I know ways around that.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.413
- No, no. I... Please. I can't.
- Okay, look,

19:44.415 --> 19:46.316
I've been alone in a freezer
for years.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.152
So either we're doing
this right now,

19:48.154 --> 19:52.088
or I am biting the bullet,
and I am doing the old guy.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.024
Okay.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.492
God! You're so hot!
Oh my God!

19:56.494 --> 19:58.994
- It's the humidity.
- Oh, yes!

20:03.534 --> 20:04.569
Holy...

20:05.971 --> 20:09.440
Nutting up, definitely
not shutting up.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.644
Yeah!

20:25.456 --> 20:28.124
- Aah! Oh, shit!
- Oh! Whoa!

20:28.126 --> 20:30.626
Sorry, it's Washington's
old flintlock.

20:30.628 --> 20:33.328
It's a gift to Eisenhower
from the emperor of Japan.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.530
Oh, touché.

20:34.532 --> 20:35.999
- I heard a strange noise.
- Yeah.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.134
I've been hearing
some strange noises too.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.369
Oh, yeah. That was us
having sex.

20:40.371 --> 20:42.838
Rule number one.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.175
Yeah, maybe rule number 32
for her.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.213
What? Hey.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.049
Okay. Ready?

20:51.482 --> 20:53.516
- Go!
- Okay, let's go. Come on.

20:53.518 --> 20:56.222
Oh, fuck. Shit.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.891
- Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, my God, you're back.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.093
I mean, you're back
or whatever. That's cool.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.095
I'm not staying.
I came to get weapons.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.329
At 1:00 in the morning?

21:06.331 --> 21:07.632
Yeah, after a month missing.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.034
Little Rock's gone.

21:23.848 --> 21:27.217
It was great. It felt so good
to be on the move again.

21:27.219 --> 21:31.387
We've been having a really
good time here too. Together.

21:31.389 --> 21:35.025
We picked up someone new.
Just a boy.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.394
He's a couple years older
than Little Rock,

21:37.396 --> 21:38.595
and he's from Berkeley.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.663
- Berkeley?
- Mm-hm.

21:40.665 --> 21:42.098

21:54.180 --> 21:56.546
She's dating a musician!

21:56.548 --> 22:00.453
Come on, don't you think you're,
like, overreacting a little bit?

22:03.055 --> 22:06.123
Yeah. Yeah. No, I could be
overreacting.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.859
I'm... I'm sorry.
You're right.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.559
You go ahead.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.770

- Yeah.

23:01.479 --> 23:05.981
Hey, have you ever heard
of this place, Graceland?

23:05.983 --> 23:09.185
Elvis was a fraud.
He ripped off the black man.

23:09.187 --> 23:13.824
Oh. I... I don't know. I've just
always wanted to go there.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.326
Yeah, me too. Yeah.

23:16.328 --> 23:21.464

I'm so worried, you guys.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.229
They're traveling
all that way,

23:52.231 --> 23:54.130
and all they have
is a fucking guitar.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.866
Yeah, with no intention
of ever swinging it at anything.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.468
You know, because
he's a hippie.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.336
She's supposed to be
killing the dead,

24:00.338 --> 24:02.404
- not following them.
- Oh, God.

24:02.406 --> 24:04.339
There's something going on
out there.

24:04.341 --> 24:06.576
- What?
- Berkeley told us

24:06.578 --> 24:08.377
about this new kind of zombie

24:08.379 --> 24:10.881
that's stronger, and faster,

24:10.883 --> 24:14.517
and deadlier and better
adapted to the hunt.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.752
I'm sorry, but that
sounds totally made up.

24:16.754 --> 24:18.954
If you want us to come
with you, just ask us.

24:18.956 --> 24:21.457
Honestly, I just came back
for guns and ammunition.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.259
Come on. Stop begging.
We'll do it.

24:23.261 --> 24:24.928
You know, this is
all your fault.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.695
- Me?
- If you hadn't pushed her away...

24:26.697 --> 24:28.065
Well,
not exactly, no.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.432
I didn't just run
from him.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.770
She ran from you too.

24:32.436 --> 24:33.571
What?

24:34.940 --> 24:37.906
You... You mean well,
but you're...

24:37.908 --> 24:39.244
kind of overbearing.

24:40.444 --> 24:42.878
Oh, right.
I'm overbearing?

24:42.880 --> 24:44.413
She's not a kid
anymore.

24:44.415 --> 24:46.382
Yeah, she's not a kid,
but I don't know,

24:46.384 --> 24:48.017
it sounds like
she needs us.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.155
Whatever.
We're gonna go get her.

24:51.255 --> 24:53.457
We ride at dawn.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.928
Once she's safe,
I'm going my own way.

24:58.730 --> 25:02.132
So no goodbye,
just like...

25:02.134 --> 25:04.134
- Yeah, I'm terrible at notes.
- A lame note.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.771
Yeah, I know. You mentioned
that in the note.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.341
Uh, I, uh...

25:11.842 --> 25:15.179
I might have overreacted
a little bit.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.313
I mean, the proposal
kind of spooked me.

25:17.315 --> 25:18.748
Mm-hm.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.553
You know what
I'm trying to say.

25:22.253 --> 25:24.119
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

25:24.121 --> 25:26.189
You know how hard it is
for me to say that

25:26.191 --> 25:28.525
because I hate women
who are always apologizing

25:28.527 --> 25:30.926
for things they have
no reason to apologize for.

25:30.928 --> 25:35.867
But in this particular instance,
I actually am really sorry.

25:37.969 --> 25:41.104
Well, thank you.
That actually does mean a lot.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.339
I don't know.
Maybe this could be like a...

25:43.341 --> 25:44.944
Like a turning point for us.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.943
Yeah, maybe.

25:47.945 --> 25:50.814
Columbus,
you coming back to bed?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.153
Wow.

25:57.155 --> 25:59.321
Oh... Oh, boy.

25:59.323 --> 26:01.059
I mean, wow!

26:03.627 --> 26:08.067
Glad we had this little talk.
Real turning point.

26:10.034 --> 26:11.102
Hi.

26:13.838 --> 26:16.541
- Is that your sister?
- Oh, fuck.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.746
You definitely
don't need any help.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.913
- No, I've got it.
- Cool.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.382
The Beast is back.

26:25.384 --> 26:28.984
I cannot wait to get my hands
behind the...

26:28.986 --> 26:32.721
What the fuck?

26:32.723 --> 26:35.692
No, no, no, no, no.

26:35.694 --> 26:40.230
No way is that GD minivan
even sniffing at Graceland,

26:40.232 --> 26:43.833
home to perhaps
America's finest automobile,

26:43.835 --> 26:47.471
Elvis' 1955 Fleetwood Series 60.

26:47.473 --> 26:52.174
No. You know, it takes a real
man to drive a pink Cadillac.

26:53.377 --> 26:56.480
Might make that
a rule of my own.

26:56.482 --> 26:57.980
On second thought, fuck that,

26:57.982 --> 27:00.016
rules are for pussies.
Nothing personal.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.019
How could it not be?
That's my thing.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.752
Yeah, you're right.
It was personal.

27:03.754 --> 27:05.355
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.990
<i>Even Tallahassee knows</i>

27:06.992 --> 27:08.423
<i>beggars can't be choosers.</i>

27:08.425 --> 27:10.493
<i>Vehicles with working batteries
and parts</i>

27:10.495 --> 27:12.261
<i>are way scarcer nowadays,</i>

27:12.263 --> 27:14.763
<i>thanks to years
of neglect and decline.</i>

27:14.765 --> 27:15.932
Breakaway mirror.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.767
<i>We can't be so picky anymore.</i>

27:17.769 --> 27:19.969
- Clear.
- What? Oh, okay.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.903
- Booyah.
- Okay.

27:21.905 --> 27:23.341
Heh!

27:26.611 --> 27:29.045
- This never happened.
- I'll get the door.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.283
I got it.
I'm gonna lay in the back.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.549
- Oh, catch.
- Oh!

27:34.551 --> 27:37.286
Shoot. Heh, I got it!

27:37.288 --> 27:40.789
What in the butt?

27:40.791 --> 27:42.625
- Ah, shit.
- What?

27:42.627 --> 27:43.893
- Hi!
- Hi.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.096
Are we dropping her off

27:47.098 --> 27:48.798
at an animal shelter
or something?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.098
She's a human being.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.101
We're not gonna
leave her here alone.

27:52.103 --> 27:55.038
We can't
just leave Columbus' girlfriend.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.471
Okay.

27:56.473 --> 27:57.774
A minivan. Nice.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.107
I'm not gonna feel guilty.

27:59.109 --> 28:00.710
You left me in
the harshest way.

28:00.712 --> 28:01.912
You recovered quickly.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.913
- Well, thank you.
- Can you help me?

28:03.915 --> 28:05.414
- I got it.
- Okay.

28:05.416 --> 28:07.115
- It's just, like, heavy.
- No problem.

28:07.117 --> 28:08.884
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, get in.

28:08.886 --> 28:11.022
Okay. You are so nice.

28:19.130 --> 28:23.133
Ah, Makkapitew, Askuwheteau,
Sunukkuhkau...

28:23.135 --> 28:24.666
Is he having a seizure?

28:24.668 --> 28:27.135
I'm trying out
Blackfoot names,

28:27.137 --> 28:29.873
so full shushy or you
go back in your mall fridge.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.307
Okay.

28:31.309 --> 28:34.210
Oh, I didn't tell you.
We met at the mall.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.480
- Mm.
- Yeah. I was living there.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.383
Like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

28:39.385 --> 28:42.852
Last I checked,
it's the post-acropolis.

28:42.854 --> 28:46.788
It was so sad when
the acropolis struck.

28:46.790 --> 28:48.325
Yeah, I know.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.692
Madison, can you remind me,
when we first met,

28:50.694 --> 28:52.827
did you point a gun at me
and steal my car?

28:52.829 --> 28:55.464
No. When we first met,

28:55.466 --> 28:57.800
I told you
you were really smart.

28:57.802 --> 29:01.503
- Oh, yeah.
- And then I slept with you.

29:01.505 --> 29:02.971
That's right. You did.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.443
Road trip! Here we go!

29:08.445 --> 29:10.680
This is gonna be a long drive.

29:19.723 --> 29:22.659
I love the smell of
gunpowder in the morning.

29:22.661 --> 29:25.130
Eh, I'm more of
a patchouli oil guy myself.

29:26.498 --> 29:30.499
You don't...
You don't have weed, do you?

29:30.501 --> 29:33.836
I've always wanted to smoke
way too much weed.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.438
Do I look like
the type of person

29:35.440 --> 29:37.673
that would have weed on me?

29:37.675 --> 29:40.542
Oh, no. I w... That...
I'm sorry, that was...

29:40.544 --> 29:42.912
- Boom, yeah.
- Ha! Oh.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.382
- Of course I do. Oh, I love weed.
- You got me there.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.117
- Look. I mean, look at me.
- Yeah.

29:48.119 --> 29:53.191
I wanted to say it's really nice
to have another woman around.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.058
Yeah.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.228
Like to talk
about relationships.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.433
- Recipes.
- Rings.

30:02.532 --> 30:04.768
Oh, my God.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.371
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

30:07.871 --> 30:10.740
I know! I found it
in the bedside drawer.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.075
I think it belonged
to the first lady or...

30:13.077 --> 30:14.845
You know what?
I think you're right.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.712
It did belong
to the first lady.

30:17.714 --> 30:20.215
Well, I think it was given
to the first lady,

30:20.217 --> 30:21.916
but she heartlessly
rejected it.

30:21.918 --> 30:26.122
What kind of idiot would
turn down a ring like this?

30:26.124 --> 30:30.292
Maybe an idiot who didn't
wanna be weighed down.

30:30.294 --> 30:32.662
Anchored. Chained
to something immobile.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.762
Hmm...

30:36.734 --> 30:40.103
- Oh, shit. Are you okay?
- Oh, shoot!

30:40.105 --> 30:41.770
Forgot the seatbelt rule.

30:41.772 --> 30:44.106
So she knows the rules?

30:44.108 --> 30:45.907
Yeah, I told her
just a few of them.

30:45.909 --> 30:49.645
- Seventy-three. Are there more?
- Nope, that's it.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.780
- I gotta check this out.
- You guys have spent

30:51.782 --> 30:53.383
a lot of time together, huh?

30:53.385 --> 30:54.951
That's sweet.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.820
You're cute together.
I like it.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.654
Oh!

31:07.565 --> 31:08.834
This looks promising.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.807
He's so flexible.

31:18.809 --> 31:21.277
That's what's so great
about him. He's very bendy.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.645
Ohio, whenever
you're done with that...

31:23.647 --> 31:24.750
What? Yeah.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.951
Ah!

31:28.953 --> 31:30.486
What? No. No, no, no.

31:30.488 --> 31:31.854
No way. Nonstarter.

31:31.856 --> 31:33.888
You know how I feel
about clowns.

31:33.890 --> 31:35.791
- No, not that.
- What?

31:35.793 --> 31:38.162
- That.
- Oh.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.201
- Looks good.
- Mm.

31:43.367 --> 31:45.067
- Can I see?
- Hm?

31:45.069 --> 31:46.402
Can I see?

31:46.404 --> 31:49.471
Yeah. Here you go. Yeah.

31:52.510 --> 31:56.645
- The old man is so tiny.
- Can you see that?

31:58.015 --> 32:00.150
What's-his-name,
you're so tiny.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.518
Now you're not.
Now you are.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.951
Now you're not. Now you are.

32:02.953 --> 32:05.121
Now you're not. Now you are.
Now you're not.

32:05.123 --> 32:07.021
Tiny. Big. Tiny!

32:07.023 --> 32:10.392
- She is adorable.
- She is. I'm lucky.

32:10.394 --> 32:12.295
Tiny. Big. Tiny.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.731
You're overreacting, okay?

32:15.733 --> 32:17.299
Madison's not
a real thing.

32:17.301 --> 32:20.068
It was just circumstance.
It was a lack of options.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.971
You could say
the same thing about us.

32:21.973 --> 32:24.640
- What?
- Circumstance, lack of options.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.175
Really? You really think that?

32:26.177 --> 32:28.010
Whereas you two seem
like soul mates.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.778
Destined to share
deep thoughts.

32:29.780 --> 32:32.115
Maybe you're right,
maybe we are soul mates.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.784
Because she's nice, all right?
And I'm nice.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.419
And you're not.
You're mean.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.422
- Whatever. I'm not mean.
- Yeah, you're kind of mean.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.690
Well, my sister is missing.
She could be dead.

32:41.692 --> 32:43.726
You're screwing
some Forever 21-year-old.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.461
So if I wanna be mean,
I'll be mean.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.130
I don't have
the right shoes.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.865
Oh, you could borrow
a pair of my strappy sandals.

32:49.867 --> 32:50.935
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

32:52.870 --> 32:56.505
Kidding. You... She was ki...
You guys are all very sarcastic.

32:56.507 --> 32:59.674
Yeah, they're not nice people.
Sorry. Just try to ignore them.

32:59.676 --> 33:02.612
- Yeah. Yeah. Ignore us.
- Please, God, ignore us.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.149
Ah, see? Mean.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.184
All right!

33:09.186 --> 33:10.853
This is what
I'm talking about.

33:10.855 --> 33:13.256
We're finally gonna be
riding in style.

33:13.258 --> 33:16.759
I partied with 3 Doors Down
in one of these. It was so...

33:16.761 --> 33:18.693
Oh, shit.

33:23.367 --> 33:24.465
What?

33:25.636 --> 33:27.236
Man, we're getting
good at this.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.271
- Columbus.
- Tallahassee.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.774
- The hood is 12 o'clock.
- Yes.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.678
Trunk is 6. You're our eyes.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.178
Hey, don't worry,
you guys.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.280
They are much more afraid of us
than we are of them.

33:39.282 --> 33:42.017
God, that is not even
remotely true.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.653
- Well, what do I do?
- You know how cheerleaders

33:44.655 --> 33:46.088
- form a pyramid?
- Yeah.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.524
And the three on the bottom

33:47.526 --> 33:49.424
- anchor the pyramid?
- Oh, yeah.

33:49.426 --> 33:52.428
I don't give a shit what you do,
just stay out of my way.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.829
Okay, 8 o'clock. Eight o'clock.

33:54.831 --> 33:58.134
Did you say the front was 12?
Oh, fuck me. Sorry. Two o'clock.

33:58.136 --> 34:01.103
Eleven! Eleven! Seven-thirty!

34:01.105 --> 34:03.239
Six o'clock. Six!

34:03.241 --> 34:05.074
I'll get 6.

34:06.176 --> 34:07.509
Uh, shit. One-fifteen.

34:07.511 --> 34:08.511
One-thirteen, 1:20.

34:08.513 --> 34:09.911
It's moving that way.

34:09.914 --> 34:11.679

34:49.386 --> 34:50.688
Okay. I'll get 3.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.688

In moments of great dishonor

38:49.560 --> 38:54.395
ancient samurai warriors
were required to commit seppuku,

38:54.397 --> 38:59.303
or ritual suicide
by disembowelment.

to start a business

where strangers drive strangers
around in their car

39:32.068 --> 39:34.136
- for money.
- Mm.

39:34.138 --> 39:37.272
Let's say you were really
drunk and needed a ride home.

39:37.274 --> 39:38.774
You'd just get online

39:38.776 --> 39:40.743
and hop right in
with a stranger.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.377
And they'd take you
anywhere you wanna go.

39:43.379 --> 39:45.948
- Oh, yeah. Who then kills you.
- Yeah. Ha, ha!

39:45.950 --> 39:48.718
They'd have gum
or, like, lollipops.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.486
That was what my parents
taught me.

39:50.488 --> 39:54.189
They were like, "If a stranger
offers you candy or gum,

39:54.191 --> 39:55.658
get in their car."
Great idea.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.359
If they try to murder you,

39:57.361 --> 39:59.495
you can have a system
so you can rate them.

39:59.497 --> 40:02.198
If they try to murder you,
like, "You get zero points."

40:02.200 --> 40:05.667
But if they don't try to murder
you, "You get five points."

40:05.669 --> 40:08.136
Madison, I think it is
a very good idea.

40:08.138 --> 40:10.673
That's... No, I cannot
see that going wrong.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.709
All I'm saying is the
taxi industry was very flawed.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.015
- Mm, oop...
- Are you okay?

40:19.017 --> 40:21.783
I think I'm, like, hot.
I'm hot.

40:21.785 --> 40:23.317
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

40:23.319 --> 40:25.687
I'm used to being in
the freezer all the time.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.557
- Get this off.
- Yeah. Sure. That makes sense.

40:34.330 --> 40:37.834
I feel funny. My tongue...

40:37.836 --> 40:39.801
My tongue... My tongue...

40:39.803 --> 40:41.502
Boss?
You're gonna wanna pull over.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.939
- No.
- Pull over.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.339
We're making good progress.

40:45.341 --> 40:46.341
- Ugh!
- Pull over!

40:46.343 --> 40:48.009
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.852
- Oh.
- Oh.

40:56.854 --> 40:57.886
Chunkage.

40:57.888 --> 40:59.787
Maybe she'll pull through.

40:59.789 --> 41:02.424
What? You are the one
who says "don't take chances."

41:04.595 --> 41:07.598
So who wants do the honors?

41:08.932 --> 41:11.633
I mean, personally,
I wouldn't mind,

41:11.635 --> 41:15.004
but I don't want
you guys calling me selfish.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.207
Hey, come on. She is a living,
thinking being. Okay?

41:18.209 --> 41:19.741
She's a living being.

41:19.743 --> 41:24.279
Look, I know you guys
are in love or whatever,

41:24.281 --> 41:26.714
but in two minutes,
she's gonna become a:

41:28.618 --> 41:32.955
A zombie, not a velociraptor.
And it's the right thing to do.

41:32.957 --> 41:36.459
If you love something,
you shoot it in the face

41:36.461 --> 41:39.194
so it doesn't become
a flesh-eating monster.

41:39.196 --> 41:40.629
I know.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.698
She's making a good point.

41:42.700 --> 41:48.970
Maybe it's time for you to be
the Brave Little Toaster.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.111

41:56.113 --> 41:57.846

42:11.928 --> 42:14.029

Madison, Madison, please.

42:15.832 --> 42:18.167
- Madison, please. Please, please.
- Don't hurt me!

42:18.169 --> 42:19.669
- No, no, no!
- Wait. Listen to me!

42:19.671 --> 42:20.903
- Please. Wait.
- No, no, no!

42:20.905 --> 42:23.071
- Madison, just wait.
- I'm a monster.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.839
- I'm a monster.
- Please, please.

42:24.841 --> 42:27.475
Listen. I realize we don't
know each other that well.

42:27.477 --> 42:29.979
I mean, well, we do
in the biblical sense, yes.

42:29.981 --> 42:32.015
But I think you're
a really great person.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.250
Well, not now.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.455
I'm sorry.

42:53.303 --> 42:55.504
Thanks.

42:55.506 --> 42:57.339
Can we just, uh...

42:57.341 --> 42:59.374
I'm so sorry.

42:59.376 --> 43:01.642
All right. Just...
Come on, come on, let's go.

43:12.555 --> 43:14.555
I'm not gonna lie and say

43:14.557 --> 43:17.261
that I'm broken up
about it, but, um...

43:18.863 --> 43:20.997
- I am sorry.
- Yeah.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.064
- She didn't deserve that.
- Thanks, man.

43:23.066 --> 43:27.772
He's right. That's a terrible
way to go, even for...

43:29.006 --> 43:31.238
- It's....
- Oh, come on. It's Madison.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.575
- You know that.
- Madison!

43:32.577 --> 43:34.642
You know that, okay?
Her name is Madison.

43:34.644 --> 43:37.879
Or her name was Madison.
And she was a real person, okay?

43:37.881 --> 43:40.015
She had, you know,
complex feelings

43:40.017 --> 43:41.816
and emotions and interests.

43:41.818 --> 43:46.921
She liked dolphins and rainbows,
you know? And double rainbows.

43:46.923 --> 43:49.658
- I'm agreeing. It's sad.
- Okay.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.392
That is obviously not
what I wanted.

43:51.394 --> 43:54.095
- What is it that you do want?
- I wanna find my sister.

43:54.097 --> 43:55.263
Me too.

43:55.265 --> 43:56.964
- Good.
- Good.

43:56.966 --> 43:59.433
- Good. Great. Awesome.
- Great, in fact. Great.

43:59.435 --> 44:01.303
This is gonna be
a long drive.

44:12.482 --> 44:14.049
This is it.

44:14.051 --> 44:17.252
Hey, little buddy,
don't be cruel to me

44:17.254 --> 44:19.457

but we're here.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.424
Oh. Oh, my God.

44:23.426 --> 44:24.859

44:27.198 --> 44:29.698

made in my life

44:29.700 --> 44:32.633

to this moment right here,

44:32.635 --> 44:35.604
right now,
3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard.

44:35.606 --> 44:39.073
I feel like a 1954 teenybopper.

44:39.075 --> 44:40.144
And here comes...

44:42.747 --> 44:43.681
No.

44:46.582 --> 44:48.649
No, no, no!

44:48.651 --> 44:51.319
Hey, dude, if you need,
like, a moment or...

44:51.321 --> 44:54.022
Oh, my God. No Graceland.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.756

little break in this world?

45:05.102 --> 45:07.203
You're not the only one
that's upset.

45:07.205 --> 45:10.973
Just... Just drive.
Drive, drive. Drive now!

45:10.975 --> 45:12.743
Get away from here. Go!

45:16.713 --> 45:18.846
<i>Graceland was a pile of rubble,</i>

45:18.848 --> 45:20.482

45:20.484 --> 45:22.350
<i>and we were unsure

45:24.988 --> 45:26.955

Well, when Z-land

45:31.361 --> 45:33.564
Hey, Florida, 11 o'clock.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.332

45:38.334 --> 45:42.339
- Hound Dog Hotel.
- Oh, what a bunch of bull.

45:44.274 --> 45:47.078
- Whoa, the Beast!
- Little Rock!

45:55.051 --> 45:57.752
Damn. Wow,

45:57.754 --> 45:59.520
for a place
that ain't Graceland,

45:59.522 --> 46:01.823
it sure looks a hell
of a lot like Graceland.

46:01.825 --> 46:03.424
- Yeah, it does.
- Here's the idea.

46:03.426 --> 46:05.060
We'll split up.
I'll go this way.

46:05.062 --> 46:06.861
No, no, no.
I should talk to her.

46:06.863 --> 46:09.932
I'm her sister. I'll talk to
her first. You guys stay here.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.700
Mm, sound.

46:11.702 --> 46:14.903
- Huh.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh.

46:14.905 --> 46:17.404
- Little respect.
- Why? He's dead probably.

46:17.406 --> 46:19.876
Oh. Oh, for you. Okay.

46:22.412 --> 46:24.613
- This is so degrading.
- It's not for me.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.582
Yeah, I know.

46:26.917 --> 46:28.417
Okay.

46:28.419 --> 46:30.419

- Smells like a wet dog died.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.154
- That's not... Push it.
- I am.

46:32.156 --> 46:34.959

- Yeah, okay. Sorry.

46:39.530 --> 46:42.096

46:42.098 --> 46:44.399
This is incredible.

46:44.401 --> 46:48.035
It's a perfect fit. I feel

46:48.037 --> 46:52.274
Are you jealous that I have
the same size shoe as Elvis?

46:52.276 --> 46:55.980
No. It's not like those
are Elvis' actual shoes.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.352
I got a thing for the King.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.855
No, no,
don't shoot my friends.

48:13.857 --> 48:16.457
- Anybody else in here with you?
- No, just us.

48:16.459 --> 48:19.861
We're all civilized people.
Let's just put the guns down.

48:19.863 --> 48:22.964
Why the hell are you wearing
Elvis' actual shoes?

48:22.966 --> 48:24.001
Comfort.

48:25.669 --> 48:27.868
- You live here?
- Yeah.

48:27.870 --> 48:30.971
So that car out front, the girl
who was driving it, is she...

48:30.973 --> 48:34.042
Gone. She and that poser
peace lover of hers...

48:34.044 --> 48:36.611
- Berkeley.
- Berkeley.

48:36.613 --> 48:37.979
...took off a few days ago.

48:37.981 --> 48:39.982
And trust me,
they shouldn't have.

48:39.984 --> 48:41.216
It's not safe out there.

48:41.218 --> 48:44.118
- Damn it.
- Why didn't they take the Beast?

48:44.120 --> 48:46.053
He said it was
too "establishment."

48:46.055 --> 48:49.390
Oh, I will kill
that little fart snack myself.

48:49.392 --> 48:51.392
You're lucky I didn't do
the same to you.

48:51.394 --> 48:54.531
Seriously. You know how close
I came to Murraying you?

48:57.568 --> 48:59.734
To what-ing him?

48:59.736 --> 49:02.703
Murraying him. You know,
when you shoot someone

49:02.705 --> 49:04.673
because you think
they're a zombie.

49:04.675 --> 49:07.441
Apparently, that's
how Bill Murray died.

49:07.443 --> 49:09.578
Wow, God, who's Bill Murray?
I never...

49:09.580 --> 49:11.212
I don't even know
what that is.

49:11.214 --> 49:13.714
Oh, the actor.
That's so sad.

49:13.716 --> 49:15.417
I don't read <i>Variety.</i>
That's sad.

49:15.419 --> 49:18.086
Sorry if you knew him.
If you didn't, I'm still sorry.

49:18.088 --> 49:20.854
It's sad when anybody dies.
Sounds like an urban legend.

49:20.856 --> 49:23.426
- It happened.
- I doubt it. It's weird. What?

49:26.097 --> 49:28.529
I'll say this about Murray,

49:28.531 --> 49:32.600
if I ever find out who did him,
I'm gonna do him.

49:32.602 --> 49:34.736
Me too. I'll be...
You first, but me second.

49:34.738 --> 49:36.504
Don't listen to this guy.

49:36.506 --> 49:38.173
He's killed more
celebrities than cocaine.

49:38.175 --> 49:39.908
The girl that was here before,

49:39.910 --> 49:41.542
did she say
where she was going?

49:41.544 --> 49:44.513
No, but that idiot Berkeley

49:44.515 --> 49:46.448
wouldn't shut up about it.

49:46.450 --> 49:48.683
Babylon is a commune,
safe haven,

49:48.685 --> 49:50.250
protected on all sides.

49:50.252 --> 49:53.687
Completely pacifist.
No guns or violence of any kind.

49:53.689 --> 49:55.457
A lot of young people too,
you know.

49:55.459 --> 49:57.526
Generation Z living
in peace and harmony.

49:57.528 --> 49:59.794
- It sounds cool.
- I know you had your heart set

49:59.796 --> 50:04.635
on this Graceland, but this
is <i>mucho, mucho</i> better.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.910
This is a very good replica
of the King's Jungle Room,

50:14.912 --> 50:17.245
where he recorded
his last two albums.

50:17.247 --> 50:21.082
<i>From Elvis Presley Boulevard,</i>
<i>Memphis, Tennessee</i> and...

50:21.084 --> 50:23.250
And <i>Moody Blue.</i>

50:23.252 --> 50:24.455
You know your Elvis.

50:25.921 --> 50:28.792
Every lover of the King
has a story.

50:29.926 --> 50:31.459
What's yours?

50:31.461 --> 50:34.863
My mama took me to see Elvis
when I was a kid.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.631
Something about him.
Attitude, the music...

50:37.633 --> 50:40.134
The hips, the ass.

50:40.136 --> 50:42.136
Well, I was 10,
but with Elvis,

50:42.138 --> 50:43.738
there is something
for everyone.

50:43.740 --> 50:46.006
Cut to later,
I'm in high school.

50:46.008 --> 50:48.944
And my buddy
Frankie Hammond says, uh:

50:48.946 --> 50:51.279
"Do your Elvis."

50:51.281 --> 50:54.616
I said, "We're in the library.
It's gonna be loud."

50:54.618 --> 50:57.151
He convinces me. He starts
tapping his pencil,

50:57.153 --> 50:58.388
and I get up.

51:02.193 --> 51:05.627
♪ You ain't nothing
But a hound dog ♪

51:05.629 --> 51:08.462
♪ Crying all the time
Bo, bo, doo-de-doo ♪

51:08.464 --> 51:11.232
Everybody starts gathering
around and clapping,

51:11.234 --> 51:14.169
and I jumped on a table.
I finish off with a flourish.

51:14.171 --> 51:16.169
♪ You ain't never
Caught a rabbit ♪

51:16.171 --> 51:18.038
♪ You ain't no friend of mine ♪

51:19.508 --> 51:22.845
Yeah! And the whole place,
thunderous applause.

51:22.847 --> 51:26.013
And up comes the cutest girl
in the school,

51:26.015 --> 51:30.218
Robin Rogers, who never
gave me the time of day before.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.553
She plants a kiss
on my cheek.

51:32.555 --> 51:34.855
And for a moment, just one,

51:34.857 --> 51:36.626
I felt like the King.

51:39.696 --> 51:42.533
I suddenly feel a little jealous
of Robin Rogers.

51:44.702 --> 51:45.669
You don't say.

51:47.970 --> 51:49.439
I don't know about you...

51:51.075 --> 51:52.777
...but I feel my temperature
rising.

51:57.381 --> 51:58.582
Mm.

52:01.517 --> 52:04.319
This is Babylon.

52:04.321 --> 52:07.721
Oh, like those ancient
hanging gardens.

52:07.723 --> 52:09.857
- Huh?
- Of Babylon.

52:09.859 --> 52:13.093
No, no. It's named
for that cool David Gray song.

52:13.095 --> 52:14.931
Man, I wish I'd written
that one.

52:16.267 --> 52:19.066
No guns allowed
is our one rule.

52:19.068 --> 52:22.238
- That, and no group sex.
- All right. Hand them over.

52:24.874 --> 52:27.107
Here you go.

52:27.109 --> 52:29.544
No guns. No guns.
Just hugs.

52:29.546 --> 52:31.379
Then welcome.

52:31.381 --> 52:33.747
Come on, señorita.
You're gonna love this place.

52:33.749 --> 52:35.816
It's completely safe
and entirely organic.

52:35.818 --> 52:37.752
- This is so cool.
- All right.

52:37.754 --> 52:40.455
We're gonna melt your guns here
and give you a pendant.

52:40.457 --> 52:42.290
- They melt it?
- Yeah.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.625
It's a symbolic thing.

52:43.627 --> 52:45.259
Goodbye, violence.

52:45.261 --> 52:46.895
Hello, peace.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.095
Once we're done,

52:48.097 --> 52:49.730
we'll take you up
to the rooftop.

52:49.732 --> 52:50.899
I hope you like stairs.

52:50.901 --> 52:51.836
That's good.

52:55.705 --> 52:58.073
- Thanks.
- Welcome to Babylon.

52:58.075 --> 52:59.975
Let me show you the way.

52:59.977 --> 53:01.109
Aw, right on.

53:05.615 --> 53:07.314
Hey, brother. What's up?

53:07.316 --> 53:09.019
- Hi.
- Yeah.

53:28.771 --> 53:32.307
Wake
up, my little blue suede baby.

53:32.309 --> 53:34.341
It's now or never. Ooh!

53:34.343 --> 53:37.712
My friends say you're sleeping
like a tired pup.

53:39.816 --> 53:40.982
What the fuck?

53:42.218 --> 53:43.220
Shit.

53:50.325 --> 53:52.794
Oh, no, no, no!

53:52.796 --> 53:54.796
This is not happening!

53:54.798 --> 53:57.933
This is not fucking happening!

53:57.935 --> 54:00.133
Hey, motherfucker,
that's my ride!

54:00.135 --> 54:02.669
Oh, my apologies,
tiny Elvis.

54:02.671 --> 54:05.973
Just didn't expect anything
to be parked in my driveway.

54:05.975 --> 54:07.044
Your driveway?

54:08.778 --> 54:11.279
That's right. My driveway.

54:11.281 --> 54:13.214
Well, that's funny.
When I parked in it,

54:13.216 --> 54:14.582
no one told me to pull out.

54:16.352 --> 54:18.819
Well, actually,
it's my driveway.

54:18.821 --> 54:20.654
Hey, Nevada.

54:20.656 --> 54:25.560
But see, when I'm
in town, I use it.

54:25.562 --> 54:29.031
Well, I'm in town now,
and I'm using it.

54:29.033 --> 54:31.165
Keep talking like this,
and I can arrange

54:31.167 --> 54:34.067
so neither of you
ever uses my driveway again.

54:34.069 --> 54:36.102
I don't think they're talking
about the driveway.

54:36.104 --> 54:37.506
No, I don't think so.

54:37.508 --> 54:39.774
- You happy now? Good move.
- Satisfied? Good job.

54:39.776 --> 54:42.609
- Does he remind you of...?
- Yeah, it's weird.

54:42.611 --> 54:45.379
I don't like you at all.

54:45.381 --> 54:46.747
It's not weird,
it's creepy.

54:46.749 --> 54:48.415
It's like
an un-funhouse mirror.

54:48.417 --> 54:51.685
I think you double-parked
or more perpendicular-parked.

54:51.687 --> 54:53.721
- Hope we don't get a ticket.
- Whoa.

54:53.723 --> 54:55.823
- Calm down.
- I'm just ragging you.

54:55.825 --> 54:58.392
- What is going on here?
- What?

54:58.394 --> 55:00.495
- What do you mean, "what"?
- What?

55:00.497 --> 55:03.330
- Does he not remind you of...?
- Hello, everyone.

55:03.332 --> 55:05.533
Of... Of what?

55:05.535 --> 55:07.035
- This is Albuquerque.
- Howdy.

55:07.037 --> 55:09.169
- I'm Flagstaff.
- Hey. I'm Columbus.

55:09.171 --> 55:10.772
Oh, great.

55:10.774 --> 55:13.508
Uh, this is Tallahassee,
Wichita,

55:13.510 --> 55:15.709
- and I guess you know Nevada.
- Yes, I do.

55:15.711 --> 55:16.877
Easy, cowboy.

55:16.879 --> 55:18.912
So sorry about your ex-car.

55:18.914 --> 55:22.285
I guess, as I like to say,
expect the unexpected.

55:23.553 --> 55:26.620
- It's one of my commandments.
- Oh.

55:26.622 --> 55:28.589
- Commandments?
- Yeah. Sort of guidelines

55:28.591 --> 55:30.725
for staying alive.
I've got loads of them.

55:30.727 --> 55:32.761
- Hm, interesting.
- Number one is teamwork.

55:32.763 --> 55:35.330
Teamwork. That's so great.

55:35.332 --> 55:37.232
I spent a long time
thinking about it.

55:37.234 --> 55:39.901
I have rules, you know,
which is, like, less biblical.

55:39.903 --> 55:42.636
I love rules. Without rules,
everything's chaos.

55:42.638 --> 55:45.140
- Thank you.
- Columbus has quite a few rules.

55:45.142 --> 55:47.241
- I do.
- Awesome. Like what?

55:47.243 --> 55:49.644
- I don't wanna toot my own horn.
- Go on, toot.

55:49.646 --> 55:51.879
- Let me toot for him. Uh...
- Thank you.

55:51.881 --> 55:54.883
- Number one, cardio.
- That's right.

55:54.885 --> 55:56.051
Cardio. Okay.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.086
- What?
- I don't mean to laugh.

55:58.088 --> 56:02.089
It's just that cardiovascular
fitness is his number 29,

56:02.091 --> 56:03.892
meaning he has
28 other commandments

56:03.894 --> 56:05.493
that he finds more important,

56:05.495 --> 56:08.095
like, say, what's one
of your great ones?

56:08.097 --> 56:10.799
Number 12. The world
is your bathroom, meaning

56:10.801 --> 56:14.069
you can whip it out wherever
you want, and have at it.

56:14.071 --> 56:16.270
Oh, just whip it out
wherever you want!

56:16.272 --> 56:17.805
That sounds a little uncouth.

56:17.807 --> 56:20.107
The "whip it out" part's
for guys, obviously.

56:20.109 --> 56:23.044
If you're a woman,
you can reveal it.

56:23.046 --> 56:25.312
- Whichever.
- I have beware of bathrooms.

56:25.314 --> 56:27.515
Yeah, I'm just generally
careful around them.

56:27.517 --> 56:29.649
But it's not a competition.

56:29.651 --> 56:32.520
- No, doesn't have to be.
- But number 18 is limber up.

56:32.522 --> 56:34.555
- But that's...
- That's fine. I have warm up.

56:34.557 --> 56:37.625
Again, not a competition,
but commandment number 45

56:37.627 --> 56:39.894
for me is, well,
mind your manners.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.495
Just because
it's the apocalypse

56:41.497 --> 56:43.131
doesn't mean
you have to be rude.

56:43.133 --> 56:45.031
Keep your hands
to yourself, number 42.

56:45.033 --> 56:46.167
Do you have sunscreen?

56:46.169 --> 56:47.903
- Just shade.
- Shade. Of course.

56:47.905 --> 56:50.872
It's free. It's everywhere.
Yeah. Number two, double tap.

56:50.874 --> 56:53.274
I have number five,
confirm your kill.

56:53.276 --> 56:55.310
- Confirm your kill.
- Avoid perishables.

56:55.312 --> 56:57.279
- Do you have that?
- Sorry. Ziploc bags.

56:57.281 --> 56:59.346
- Same thing, different word.
- Yeah. Exactly.

56:59.348 --> 57:01.716
I probably would shy away
from the word "Ziploc"

57:01.718 --> 57:03.450
because I try
to avoid name brands.

57:03.452 --> 57:06.520
Okay, great. So, what brought
you guys back so soon?

57:06.522 --> 57:09.524
We was headed for the Rockies,
but the goddamn Bolts...

57:09.526 --> 57:11.359
- Bolts?
- Yeah.

57:11.361 --> 57:12.961
The zombies
out on the plains.

57:12.963 --> 57:15.196
They're a lot tougher
than what we're used to.

57:15.198 --> 57:18.198
I guess because of all
the running and hunting.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.368
So we call them Bolts,
as in Usain.

57:20.370 --> 57:21.903
As in pretty fucking athletic.

57:21.905 --> 57:23.772
No, that makes total sense.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.274
- We call them T-800s.
- <i>Terminator.</i> Yes! I love it.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.575
Really?

57:27.577 --> 57:29.209
Yes. My favorite movie.
Well, <i>T2.</i>

57:29.211 --> 57:31.044
Yeah, <i>T2</i> is my
second favorite movie.

57:31.046 --> 57:34.115
- What's number one?
- Uh, it's <i>Fantasia.</i>

57:35.283 --> 57:36.883
Well, anyhow,

57:36.885 --> 57:38.852
the Bolts' food sources
are running low,

57:38.854 --> 57:40.955
so they're pushing east,
which is <i>no bueno.</i>

57:40.957 --> 57:43.124
You know what else
is <i>no bueno?</i>

57:43.126 --> 57:45.426
You murdered the Beast.

57:45.428 --> 57:48.363
Yeah, well, let me
call AAA for you.

57:48.365 --> 57:50.798
I'm sure they'll be right over.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.167
So you have to play
your cards as...

57:53.169 --> 57:56.270
Whoo, that onesie was starting
to cut off my circulation.

57:56.272 --> 57:59.207
- To your vagina?
- Your vagina.

57:59.209 --> 58:01.207
What'll you have, Florida?

58:01.209 --> 58:03.944
He strikes me as
the, uh, lemon drop type.

58:03.946 --> 58:06.948
You know, something with an
umbrella or something like that.

58:06.950 --> 58:09.551
I heard "something with
an umbrella." Make it two.

58:09.553 --> 58:10.584
Three please. Three.

58:10.586 --> 58:12.620
So that's your sidekick.

58:12.622 --> 58:14.189
That's my partner.

58:14.191 --> 58:16.790
You might look
at Flagstaff and think:

58:16.792 --> 58:19.426
"Oh, he's a little slight,
diminutive."

58:19.428 --> 58:23.298
Effeminate even, but he's
a real beast in battle. Yeah.

58:23.300 --> 58:26.433
Come on. You're being sweet.
You sweet, sweet man. Thank you.

58:26.435 --> 58:28.134
- Well, I love you.
- Love you too.

58:28.136 --> 58:30.772
Yeah, you know, Tubbs
to my Crockett over here.

58:30.774 --> 58:33.741
He may look a little bookish,
but he's an animal too.

58:33.743 --> 58:36.444
He eats zombies for breakfast,
shits them out by lunch.

58:36.446 --> 58:37.944
Cheers.

58:37.946 --> 58:40.147
He shits out
everything by lunch.

58:42.752 --> 58:45.019
What the hell was that?

58:48.925 --> 58:50.524
They must have
followed you.

58:50.526 --> 58:52.593
Oh, God, those are T-800s.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.462
Or at the very least T-700s.

58:54.464 --> 58:57.230
- There was no T-700.
- Yeah, T-800's the first model.

58:57.232 --> 59:00.301
This is great,
having the two of you.

59:00.303 --> 59:02.904
Okay.
Time to nut up or shut up.

59:02.906 --> 59:05.774
That saying's very 2009.

59:09.312 --> 59:12.145
- Okay. We got this.
- Ho!

59:12.147 --> 59:14.415
You don't send a boy
to do a man's job.

59:14.417 --> 59:16.750
We brought them here.
We'll take care of it.

59:16.752 --> 59:19.285
Yeah, you know what?
Have at 'em.

59:19.287 --> 59:21.421
You have a safe word
in case things go bad?

59:21.423 --> 59:22.991
Heh, that's good.
Come on, Flag,

59:22.993 --> 59:25.093
let's show these fuckers
how it's done.

59:25.095 --> 59:27.160
Sure. You got it, boss.

59:27.162 --> 59:29.663
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
<i>Terminator 2.</i>

59:29.665 --> 59:31.999
- Remember?
- Ready, buddy?

59:32.001 --> 59:34.167
He's so cool.

59:34.169 --> 59:36.504
Whoo, heh, heh!
Suck these bullets!

59:36.506 --> 59:37.973
Come on! Get you some!

59:37.975 --> 59:40.975
Anybody else find those
two uniquely annoying?

59:40.977 --> 59:43.413
- Get it!
- Uniquely? No.

59:45.381 --> 59:47.182
Well, I don't love
their chances.

59:47.184 --> 59:49.984
They ignored rule 52,
don't be afraid to ask for help.

59:49.986 --> 59:52.319
Get fucked in the face, bitch!

59:52.321 --> 59:53.988
- Flagstaff?
- Yeah, boss?

59:53.990 --> 59:57.024
You made the all-star team
today. I mean, no kidding.

59:57.026 --> 59:58.359
Unbelievable job.

59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.227
And is it me,
or are those Bolts

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.330
they're just getting meaner
by the day?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:05.332
- They're full-blown dickheads.
- I got an action shot of you

01:00:05.334 --> 01:00:07.569
that's going right
into the scrapbook.

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:10.671
This is gonna be a good one.
You just keep raising the bar,

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:14.207
and that's why we will continue
to ride these highways together.

01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:16.644
- I'm so proud of you.
- I learned from the best.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.680
- Oh, come on now.
- Nice work, Querq.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.048
Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.582
This is gonna be
a hell of a shot. Ha, ha!

01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:25.051
It's so cool he let you
wear the hat.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:26.587
- Querq?
- Yeah?

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.457
I think you got
a little something here.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.625
Oh, what, that?

01:00:34.196 --> 01:00:37.531
Oh, yeah, that's just...
That's just a tattoo.

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.470
Sorry, you got a tattoo
of a zombie bite?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:46.374
No, it's just a tattoo
I got one night in Bernalillo.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.276
Huh.

01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:49.776
All right, everybody.

01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:53.448
Just take it easy.
Everything's fine.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.250
Nevada, why don't you whip up
some of your signature...

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.890
All right.
That was a little weird, huh?

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:05.959
- Yeah.
- All right. Just calm down.

01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:07.895
We'll just
have a drink, you know.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:12.234
So we can just kind
of celeb... Celeb...

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:17.537
Excuse me. It's okay.

01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:20.073
It's just nerves
from the fight. Just...

01:01:21.209 --> 01:01:22.609
Uh, you guys, I think

01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:24.812
Albuquerque might be infected.

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.613
Me? I'm infected?

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.982
You got bit twice.

01:01:28.984 --> 01:01:31.017
- Ah, Flagstaff!
- No, no. That's a lie.

01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:33.020
Trust me. Okay? Trust me.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.656
I don't get bit.
I never get bit.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.790
I don't get bit either.
We're slippery.

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.158
- See?
- I know. Are you okay?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.294
- I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
- You are?

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.366
- I'm fine.
- Okay, he's fine. He's fine.

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.165
No, he's not fine. No.

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:49.169
No. You're starting to look
like a T-800. <i>Terminator 2.</i>

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.809
No. No, no, no!

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.676
No!

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.776
Aah!

01:01:56.778 --> 01:01:59.446
Move! Move!
Get out of the way.

01:01:59.448 --> 01:02:01.582
Aah! Aah!

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:02.519
Ow!

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.754
No! No!

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.622
Flagstaff, you're breaking

01:02:09.624 --> 01:02:11.394
like 10 commandments right now!

01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:20.236
This is for what you did
to the Beast! Unh!

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:22.870
Sorry!

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:25.839
- How you doing?
- Bad!

01:02:25.841 --> 01:02:27.441
- How are you?
- Bad!

01:02:29.111 --> 01:02:30.981
Sorry, shoes. Sorry, Elvis.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.388
Oh, shit. Oh!

01:02:41.022 --> 01:02:43.991
- How you doing now?
- Still bad! You wanna switch?

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.761
Switch?
How would that benefit me?

01:02:54.836 --> 01:02:55.905
Shit!

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:06.883
- Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!
- I don't wanna hit you!

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.886
Shit.

01:03:12.888 --> 01:03:15.459
Gun, gun, gun! Oh, shit!

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.428
Stop shooting! I got this!

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.798
Great, because I'm reloading!

01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:34.774
Don't swing! Don't swing!
Don't swing! Swing!

01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:36.743
Shit!

01:03:36.745 --> 01:03:39.479
No, no, no, not me!
Not me! Oh, fuck!

01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:42.616
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.921
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.988
Those guys are dicks.

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.625
Great job.

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:51.926
Thank you.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.828
- Ah. Can I wear the hat?
- Oh, negatory.

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:58.499
- Cool.
- Zombie Kill of the Year?

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.636
<i>Mm, sorry.
Not with the performance just turned in</i>

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:03.337
<i>by Matteo Bianchi
of Pisa, Italy.</i>

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.189
<i>Yeah, yeah. That Pisa.</i>

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.771
Bravisimmo, <i>Mateo.</i>

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:41.642
Ahh, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:44.211
Jesus, Big Fat Death is right.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:46.948
That thing is, like,
a huge rollover risk.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.683
It is.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:52.118
Hey, dude, I think you should
ask her to come with us.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.354
- No, no, no.
- Come on, yes.

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.488
I think they make
a nice match.

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.457
Look, what have I been
telling you guys?

01:04:57.459 --> 01:04:59.627
I'm trying to shed baggage,
not pick it up.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.729
- Yeah.
- Besides, she wouldn't do that.

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.166
She's not the type.

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.805
Stay safe,
Sunshine State.

01:05:10.772 --> 01:05:12.309
Excuse me.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.345
Stay dangerous, Nevada.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:30.558
Okay. Hey, no offense, but
my sister is still out there.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.896
Wanna hit the old road.

01:05:34.229 --> 01:05:36.398
If by some miracle
you don't die...

01:05:38.133 --> 01:05:40.736
there's always room
in my driveway.

01:05:43.405 --> 01:05:44.874
I best stay alive.

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:49.176
Okay, you're back. Good.

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:51.544
Do you know how to drive
one of these things?

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:54.848
I'm gonna just pop that puppy
off of there

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.350
and then you guys can jump in.

01:05:57.352 --> 01:05:58.787
Nice.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.758
She's a big old stallion,
but I can tame her.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.102
Whoo!

01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:17.171
Oh, shit.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:24.080
- I think he's got the hang of it.
- Shit!

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.048
- No. No, no.
- No, no, no.

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:29.216
Goddamn motherfucker!

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.319
Got it.

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:40.928
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.632
Maybe you should
leave a note.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.566
That's your department.

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:53.839
I... I just can't do it.

01:06:53.841 --> 01:06:55.110
Yeah. I'll drive.

01:07:01.783 --> 01:07:03.385
What was that?

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:05.919
Satisfying.

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:13.394
Teamwork. Always put
the team first.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.495
I can't believe
I didn't have that. Stupid.

01:07:15.497 --> 01:07:17.932
You know, if Flagstaff
was so great,

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:21.301
then where was
the undeniably gorgeous

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:24.238
but emotionally inaccessible
Kansas City?

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.805
I don't know. Maybe she split

01:07:25.807 --> 01:07:28.343
because she thought
they had a random relationship.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.444
Or maybe she was
just about to come back

01:07:31.446 --> 01:07:34.651
under the thinly veiled cover
of needing guns and ammo.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.451
Wait,
what are you getting at?

01:07:38.453 --> 01:07:41.020
I think you're smart enough
to figure it out...

01:07:41.022 --> 01:07:43.024
Oh, my God.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:45.058
You gotta be kidding me.

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.495
You gotta be kidding me.

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.897
You gotta be kidding me!

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.232
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:53.834
Why the hell
is she still alive?

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:57.537
Oh, my God, I literally
missed you guys. Yay!

01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:58.540
Oh, my God.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.142
Whoa!

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.644
Just... No, just look ahead.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:06.379
Hi, old guy!

01:08:06.381 --> 01:08:07.814
Let's hang out.

01:08:07.816 --> 01:08:09.584
- Ha-ha-ha!
- It is so weird to see you.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.718
The last time I saw you,
you were like a...

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.187
- You were a zombie.
- I wish.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.221
Stupid nut allergy.

01:08:15.223 --> 01:08:16.857
- Nut allergy? Oh.
- Yeah.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.460
Yeah, I think it was
the trail mix Wichita gave me.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.562
Who knew there were nuts
in trail mix.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.630
Not me. I thought it was vegan.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.165
I kept trying to tell you

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.635
it was only an allergic
reaction, but you thought

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.036
- I was trying to bite you.
- Yeah, well...

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:33.740
- Not that you minded last time.
- Mm.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:35.643
Thank you for shooting
over my head.

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:37.812
I was really just trying
to scare you off.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:39.813
You're not gonna get rid
of me that easy.

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:41.415
- Oh, no!
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:45.085
There I was, hiding in
the woods, when I thought:

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:49.290
"I used to live in a freezer,
so why not a freezer on wheels?"

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.392
Can't argue
with that logic.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.861
I really miss this.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.895
Was that sarcasm?

01:08:55.897 --> 01:08:57.532
Was it?

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.501
Mm-hm.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.973
Why wouldn't we
just move to an island?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.573
That's a really
good idea.

01:09:07.575 --> 01:09:09.109
Then there
wouldn't be zombies.

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.611
- Right.
- Of course.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.848
We should go
to Temptation Island.

01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:16.884
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.385
- What?
- Hey, hey.

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.519
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.354
Just... Just eyes
on the road.

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:25.024
Do you want me to change
the CD or anything?

01:09:25.026 --> 01:09:26.693
Is this a CD playing?

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.228
- Yeah. It's Port...
- What is this?

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.264
It's Portishead.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.633
- This is Portishead?
- Yeah. You know what's funny?

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.801
I used to think
it was called "Portashed"

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.603
until I went to one of
the concerts, and she explained.

01:09:37.604 --> 01:09:39.273
Yeah, I would think
"Portasheed."

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:42.276
- Right. Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah.

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:43.943
<i>It was obvious to me</i>

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:46.145
<i>that Wichita and I
were meant to be together,</i>

01:09:46.147 --> 01:09:47.613
<i>which is why Madison's return</i>

01:09:47.615 --> 01:09:49.250
<i>could not have been
worse timing.</i>

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:51.318
<i>Of course, I was glad
she wasn't a zombie.</i>

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.157
<i>But couldn't she have just
gone back to her mall fridge?</i>

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:59.294
Hey. Hey, look,
look, look. Look.

01:10:03.031 --> 01:10:04.130
Look.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.437
We made it to Baby-lon.

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:14.008
<i>If you hear more than
the usual excitement in my voice,</i>

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.776
<i>it's for two reasons.</i>

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.511
<i>One, we may have caught up
to Little Rock,</i>

01:10:18.513 --> 01:10:19.714
<i>for real this time.</i>

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.247
<i>And two, we may have</i>

01:10:21.249 --> 01:10:23.483
<i>finally found our forever home,</i>

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.786
<i>which is what I've been
looking for all along.</i>

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:29.290
- Whoa, Babylon.
- I love that song.

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:32.091
- Hm?
- This place is soy cute.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:40.332
- Whoa, Jesus!
- What the fuck?

01:10:40.334 --> 01:10:43.536
- Enjoy the little things.
- My bags were in there!

01:10:43.538 --> 01:10:46.340
- No, they weren't.
- No guns allowed!

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.977
I like this place already.
You got a sense of humor.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.712
No guns allowed.

01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:57.318
I'm not giving up my guns under
any circumstances, period-o.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.220
Well, then, there's no way
you're getting up to Babylon.

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.257
You know, you could
always wait in the car.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.763
Do you wanna see
Little Rock or not?

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:23.510
There she is!

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:25.644
I'm on a 40-day bowel blast.

01:11:25.646 --> 01:11:26.915
Little Rock.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:31.318
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.719
What are you guys
doing here?

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.354
I am so glad you're safe.

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:36.023
- Wow, okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.425
- Come here.
- Hello.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.260
Seriously, what are
you doing here?

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:41.362
Hey, we don't leave
each other.

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:42.996
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry.

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:45.198
Make me a pact.
No more notes. Ever.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.067
- No more notes. Ever.
- Ever. Great.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.937
Just so you know,
there's no group sex.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.406
- Okay, fine, group sex.
- Oh, whoa.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.741
Hey, Wichita. That means
you're Columbus,

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.911
and that makes you Tallahassee.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.911
- Berkeley?
- You're from Berkeley?

01:11:58.913 --> 01:12:00.746
- You're Berkeley?
- No, come on.

01:12:00.748 --> 01:12:02.983
What are the chances
we're both from Berkeley?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.919
- Berkeley!
- Calm down, calm down. Okay?

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:07.287
Thank you for coming
to check up on me, I guess.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.057
But you have to understand
these people are peaceful,

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.791
and they're friendly and nice.

01:12:11.793 --> 01:12:14.493
And honestly, I don't think
you're gonna fit in here.

01:12:14.495 --> 01:12:17.930
- They melted our fucking weapons!
- This is exactly what I meant.

01:12:17.932 --> 01:12:20.567
Guys, I think
we should stay.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:23.304
- You don't get a vote.
- I do get a vote.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.438
Haven't you ever heard
of women suffering?

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.643
Women's suffrage?

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.643
- No, honey.
- Oh, boy.

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.379
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm Madison.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.946
- Don't say it.
- You'll love this.

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:35.648
- Don't say it.
- That's Columbus' girlfriend.

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:36.983
It's official.

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.152
Wow, you just didn't

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.719
waste any time, did you?

01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:42.421
- Well, thank you for your vote.
- And you're welcome.

01:12:42.423 --> 01:12:45.593
Okay. I'm late for my
drum circle, so I gotta go.

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:46.826
Hey, Little Rock!

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:48.629
Sorry about that.

01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:00.340
<i>Seeing Little Rock safe</i>

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.341
<i>and surrounded by friends
her own age,</i>

01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:05.612
<i>Tallahassee realized
his nest was now empty.</i>

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.947
<i>And he began to hear
the call of the buffalo.</i>

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.889
All right, I'm ready!

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:19.326
Come on, don't be
so Gloria Glum.

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.960
I told you guys
I was leaving.

01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:22.864
So, what, you're
just gonna split?

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:29.202
It's time. Gotta set out
on my own adventures.

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.136
Little Rock's
safe,

01:13:31.138 --> 01:13:34.077
and, uh,
a lone wolf's gotta hunt.

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:36.844
So where are you gonna go?

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:39.716
The direction's
the destination. West.

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.350
West is that way.

01:13:44.352 --> 01:13:48.889
Yeah. Anyway, like the title of
a great Phil Collins song:

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:52.526
"If You Love Somebody,
Set Them Free."

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.961
- Pretty sure that wasn't him.
- Pretty sure it was.

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:57.265
- No, it was someone else.
- Pretty sure it was him.

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:01.001
Yeah. Peace.

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:05.604
Uh, I'm not much
for goodbyes, so...

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:07.273
Just don't say
the pig thing.

01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:09.376
Keep your tits dry.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.778
- Oh, okay.
- Didn't see that coming, right?

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.712
I would've rather
the pig thing.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.455
Hey.

01:14:20.888 --> 01:14:23.325
Hey, don't do nothing
I wouldn't not do.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:27.126
- You get what I'm saying.
- Not really, no.

01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:28.728
No? Okay.

01:14:29.864 --> 01:14:32.734
Anyway, gonna miss you guys.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.242
I will never forget you,
what's-his-name.

01:14:43.244 --> 01:14:45.444
- See you, pals.
- It's Tallahassee. I told you.

Oh, it's all right.
I got it.

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.318
Excuse me. Yes. I got it.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.486
- You're supposed to kick it back.
- Really?

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:02.458
- You never seen hacky sack?
- I thought it's like hopscotch.

- Salty Taffy's back!

01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:10.295
Hey, T-800s, a whole swarm
of them, heading right this way.

01:16:10.297 --> 01:16:14.567
Those goddamn fireworks
might as well be a dinner bell!

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:17.170
Stop the fireworks!
Stop the music!

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.139
Everybody shut the fuck up!

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.240
Shut up.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.907
Question:

01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:24.544
Did you melt all the weapons?

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:27.013
Yeah, that's how we made
these peace thingies.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.948
- Oh, Jesus.
- My guns!

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:31.050
Hey. Hello.
I got something going.

01:16:31.052 --> 01:16:32.885
I think I might have a plan.

01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:35.054
- Oh.
- What?

01:16:35.056 --> 01:16:37.991
Heh, I got nothing.
I'm just a songwriter.

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.859
No. No, you're
a song transcriber.

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.694
- Listen, Berkeley?
- Yeah?

01:16:41.696 --> 01:16:43.529
I don't think this
is gonna work out.

01:16:43.531 --> 01:16:45.031
Even 12-year-olds know

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.367
who Bob Dylan is,
you fucking poser.

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:50.504
Oh, my God. I'm not gonna lie,
I have truly enjoyed

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:53.173
this moment, but there
are zombies approaching.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:57.309
Okay. Uh, Civil War general,
you must know how to fight?

01:16:57.311 --> 01:16:58.577
Sure.

01:16:58.579 --> 01:17:02.182
Poverty, sexism,
social injustice.

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:04.651
- We could try running.
- I'm done running.

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:07.787
I mean, what good is a home
if you can't stay in it?

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:10.355
- Columbus.
- Yes, Thor?

01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:12.091
You're gonna make me
cry right now.

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:13.593
- No, please don't.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.461
Okay. I moved through it.

01:17:15.463 --> 01:17:18.098
From where I stand, there's
only one thing we can do.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.802
Group sex.
Right?

01:17:21.235 --> 01:17:23.004
No. Um...

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.471
We'll fight them.

01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:29.776
You'll be the first to die,
but I like your enthusiasm.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.347
- You might die.
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:37.951
All right,
everybody, listen up.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:41.888
They outnumber us 100 times,
but they ain't got what we do.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.590
- Guns?
- We don't have guns.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.157
- What?
- What we do have

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:48.594
is heart, brains
and biodiesel.

01:17:48.596 --> 01:17:50.330
<i>We're gonna light
these zombies up</i>

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.398
<i>like it's the Fourth of July.</i>

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.166
<i>Then we hit the stragglers.</i>

01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:56.636
What we do is
we form a gauntlet.

01:17:58.138 --> 01:18:00.439
One, two, three, yah!

01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:02.943
- Then we mop them up.
- Sick.

01:18:02.945 --> 01:18:05.844
- This is gonna work, right?
- It has to.

01:18:16.057 --> 01:18:17.292
- Rolling. Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:24.964
- Keep screwing.
- Yeah, I am.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.602
- Keep screwing.
- I am.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.648
No turning back now.

01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:45.419
Okay, there we go.

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:46.521
Nice.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.758
Yeah. Oh, that's gonna work.

01:18:54.128 --> 01:18:55.461
- Oh!
- Oh, that's pretty.

01:18:55.463 --> 01:18:57.130
That means the zombies
are coming!

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.831
The zombies are coming!

01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:01.704
- Time to nut up or shut up.
- You need a new line.

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:05.037
Let's kick some dicks.

01:19:05.039 --> 01:19:07.974
Just because it rhymes doesn't
make it a great catchphrase.

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:09.608
- What's her problem?
- I don't know.

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:11.413
I like it when it rhymes.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.180
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:33.700
- Zombies, they're coming!
- Oh, dear.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:36.102
Look out, guys!
Here they come. They're coming!

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.272
Battle stations!

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:41.811
Light them up!

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.896
Let's go, let's go!
Get up to safety.

01:20:16.177 --> 01:20:17.613
Here we go.

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:32.259
Okay now, blow!

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:36.528
Come on. Now would be
an ideal time to blow.

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:38.967
- It's not working.
- Damn!

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:45.904
God!

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:47.439
Holy shit.
It worked.

01:20:47.441 --> 01:20:49.776
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.045
Okay. Here, now we
mop up the stragglers.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.647
Okay. Yeah.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.384
Oh, shit.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.286
Would those be
considered stragglers?

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.123
Oh, boy. Here they come.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.027
Get ready!

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:18.104
Kill those motherfuckers!

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:35.787
Well, guys, I hate to say this.

01:21:35.789 --> 01:21:38.159
I think this might be
the end of the road.

01:21:40.994 --> 01:21:42.527
- Come here.
- I love you guys.

01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:44.499
- I love you more.
- We had a hell of a run.

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.771
Oh, my God.
They're gonna die.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.717
Oh!

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.088
Hey!

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:15.527
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

01:22:15.529 --> 01:22:17.432
Thank God for rednecks!

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.674
- Need a ride?
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.111
- Get in.
- Let's go!

01:22:33.213 --> 01:22:36.582
- Are y'all strapped in yet?
- Yep. Strapping in now.

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:38.518
- Rule four. Got it.
- You too.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.223
I'm not a pussy like Columbus.
Nothing personal.

01:22:42.656 --> 01:22:44.057
- Oh, God!
- Shit!

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.561
- Seatbelts are for a reason.
- Yep.

01:22:49.696 --> 01:22:51.496
I'm feeling
a little nauseous.

01:22:51.498 --> 01:22:54.067
- Can somebody crack a window?
- Oh, no, you don't.

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:55.768
Whoa!

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.437
- Roll down the window.
- That won't...

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.441
If you get sick,
we all get sick.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:03.108
Woo-hoo!

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:04.944
Okay, okay. Oh, God.

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:07.080
Could you pull over
so I can get eaten?

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.316
It'll be more comfortable.

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:14.121
Whoo!

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:15.491
- Oh, shit. Watch out!
- Do it!

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:21.996
Woo-hoo!

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.832
Oh, my God, you are sexy.

01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:29.471
Can you not say "sexy"?
I'm already nauseous.

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:37.713
Shit, Shit, shit!
Oh, shit.

01:23:38.946 --> 01:23:40.078
Shit.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.514
- Shit!
- You guys okay?

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.282
Thank you for flying
Big Fat Death.

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:44.750
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

01:23:44.752 --> 01:23:46.952
I told you these things
were a rollover risk!

01:23:46.954 --> 01:23:48.621
- We gotta move!
- Come on!

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.491
Hurry! Hurry! They're coming!

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:53.460
- Oh, no!
- Come on! Here they come!

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:54.997
- Go, go, go!
- Shit.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.496
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:59.933
Come on!

01:23:59.935 --> 01:24:01.303
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:04.573
Whoa!

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:10.810
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:12.545
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.147
Here they come!

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:20.756
- Go, get in. Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.591
Run!

01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:31.699
- I'm out of bullets!
- Guys, go! I'm right behind you!

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:37.872
Get in position! Form the
gauntlet! I'll hold them off!

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:43.512
<i>Donkey Kong,</i> motherfuckers!

01:25:08.869 --> 01:25:11.371

Oh!

- Hey!
- Tallahassee!

01:26:15.302 --> 01:26:18.136
- Hang on, we're coming.
- Hold on.

01:26:18.138 --> 01:26:19.471
- Help! I'm falling!
- Shit!

01:26:19.473 --> 01:26:21.340
We can't help you.

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:22.841
Guys! Help me!

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:25.344
- Shit. What should we do?
- Throw something at them.

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:28.113
Oh, shit. Okay. Shit. Sorry.

01:26:28.115 --> 01:26:31.084
Wha... You hit me in the nuts
with a hacky sack!

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:32.318
- Sorry.
- What?

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.756
I'm losing my grip.
I'm gonna fall.

01:26:36.123 --> 01:26:38.457
No! Oh, no!

01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:53.876
Long live the King.

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:57.510
- Oh.
- Ew.

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.444
Guys! I'm still here!

01:26:59.446 --> 01:27:01.413
- Give me your hand!
- Hold my arm.

01:27:01.415 --> 01:27:04.082
- Kick your foot out.
- Goddamn it, Columbus!

01:27:04.084 --> 01:27:05.518
Point your toe!

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.319
This human chain thing
is a terrible idea!

01:27:07.321 --> 01:27:08.688
- Guh!
- I can't reach.

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:10.523
Kick it, kick it. I got it.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.157
Pull, pull.

01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:14.126
Okay. I got you.

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.460
Okay.

01:27:15.462 --> 01:27:17.662
Oh, man. Are you okay?

01:27:17.664 --> 01:27:19.532
- Yeah.
- That was amazing.

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.503
Oh... Thank you.

01:27:22.803 --> 01:27:23.805
Hey.

01:27:26.707 --> 01:27:28.174
You kept the gun?

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:30.643
How could I give up
my favorite Christmas present?

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.344
Why didn't you
pull it out sooner?

01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:34.913
I forget about it but...
I smoked a lot of weed.

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:38.420
Chip off the old block.

01:27:41.722 --> 01:27:43.555
Yes.

01:27:43.557 --> 01:27:45.927
Yes?
Oh, yes, yes?

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:48.030
Yes, yes.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:50.763
Yes, yes, yes?

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.665
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:53.735
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:27:56.171 --> 01:27:57.937
What changed your mind?

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.642
Because Zombieland or not,
we're meant to be together.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:08.881
So basically, that means
this belongs to her.

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:11.951
Oh, hm. Cool.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.618
Thank you.

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.086
Okay.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.425
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.760
- Okay. I'm good.
- Okay.

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.263
- Yeah, do the damn thing. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:23.265 --> 01:28:26.432
- Great. Which hand do I...?
- This one.

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:27.802
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. Here we go.

01:28:32.339 --> 01:28:33.742
Wow.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:36.211
Come here.

01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:42.916
Nicely done.

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:46.885
I'm gonna walk that little
spitfuck down the aisle.

01:28:46.887 --> 01:28:49.555
It's a good thing
you didn't die, then.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:50.825
Washoe County.

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:56.228
- What?
- Washoe County, Nevada.

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.096
Ah, Reno.

01:28:58.098 --> 01:29:00.002
Biggest little city
in the world.

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.808
- Just go for it.
- Thank you.

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.542
- Sweet.
- Oh, my God.

01:29:11.878 --> 01:29:12.978
What? What?

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.516
- Oh, my gosh!
- Shit!

01:29:19.553 --> 01:29:23.255
- Homer. It's a long way down.
- Our work here is done.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:24.822
Let's party!

01:29:24.824 --> 01:29:26.293
- Come on!
- Yeah!

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.661
Wait for me.

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:56.621
Hell, this is
a 1955 Fleetwood Series 60. Hoo!

01:29:56.623 --> 01:30:00.827
Every hair on my body
feels like a little wang.

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:03.196
- Yikes.
- Where to?

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:05.630
Mm, how about home?

01:30:05.632 --> 01:30:06.732
Home?

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:07.869
- Yeah.
- Yes, good idea.

01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:10.905
Where's home?

01:30:12.539 --> 01:30:15.308
I think we're already there.

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:17.010
<i>Because if our adventures</i>

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:19.678
<i>had taught us about anything,
it was home.</i>

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.846
<i>Wichita didn't need
to be afraid of it.</i>

01:30:21.848 --> 01:30:23.881
<i>I didn't need
to keep looking for it.</i>

01:30:23.883 --> 01:30:27.687
<i>Because home isn't a place,
it's the people you're with.</i>

01:30:27.689 --> 01:30:29.988
<i>I guess that's why
they're called your homies.</i>

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:32.224
<i>And my homies
are pretty fucking awesome.</i>

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:34.827
<i>So till next time,
this is Columbus, Ohio,</i>

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:37.028
<i>on behalf of Wichita,

01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:21.005
<i>And for that,

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:25.777
Welcome, everyone,

01:31:25.779 --> 01:31:27.913
to the <i>Garfield 3: Flabby Tabby</i>
junket.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:29.448
You'll each have five minutes.

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.751
Please keep your questions
focused on the film

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:33.452
and don't go off-topic.

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.621
<i>The idea of a
trilogy was something...</i>

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:39.090
As an artist,
you think the great ones:

01:31:39.092 --> 01:31:41.059
<i>Godfather</i> and...

01:31:41.061 --> 01:31:43.161
uh, <i>Lethal Weapon.</i>

01:31:43.163 --> 01:31:46.999
But the question is,
why in the world <i>Garfield 3?</i>

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:49.300
- Can this be just between us?
- Yes.

01:31:49.302 --> 01:31:51.336
Drugs cost money.

01:31:51.338 --> 01:31:53.072
And I have to say,
as an actor,

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.773
how many of your nine lives
do you think you have left?

01:31:55.775 --> 01:31:59.312
Well, I've done three of these.
Three <i>Garfields.</i>

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:00.612
So that's six.

01:32:00.614 --> 01:32:02.581
The essence of Garfield,
I think...

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:03.648
Right.

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:05.850
...is the hairball.

01:32:05.852 --> 01:32:08.319
Didn't I say? I had a feeling
this would come up.

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:15.027
You don't wanna do the hairball
really quick?

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:16.795
- No.
- Can you try now?

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:19.365
- Give me a little hairball now?
- Come on.

01:32:22.168 --> 01:32:23.238
Come on.

01:32:29.177 --> 01:32:31.309
You know, how about if I
did it with you?

01:32:31.311 --> 01:32:33.312
- Okay. Come on. Come on.
- That was close.

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:34.880
We'll do a selfie together.

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.216
Great. Great.

01:32:41.254 --> 01:32:43.022
You all right, man?

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:45.323
All over the mike.

01:32:45.325 --> 01:32:46.925
Can we get a baby wipe
for Al?

01:32:46.927 --> 01:32:48.693
Maybe move him back
to his room?

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:57.205
Huge fan, Mr. Roker.

01:32:59.539 --> 01:33:01.674
All right, Tim,
let's get out of here.

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.675
Somebody get my car.
I'm ready to go.

01:33:03.677 --> 01:33:05.676
I've never seen Roker
behave that way.

01:33:05.678 --> 01:33:07.045
That was crazy.

01:33:07.047 --> 01:33:09.115
Sometimes it feels like
you against the world.

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:10.549
- Oh, my God.
- I think it is.

01:33:16.723 --> 01:33:17.855
