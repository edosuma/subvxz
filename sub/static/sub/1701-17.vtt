WEBVTT

00:05.922 --> 00:08.465
Huh? So, what do you think?

00:08.633 --> 00:10.843
Casa de Joey.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.095
Huh? I decorated it myself.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.972
- Get out.
- No.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.142
Wow, Joey, this is, uh...

00:18.351 --> 00:20.144
- Art.
- Art it is.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.732
Well, check this out.
Is it a coffee table?

00:24.899 --> 00:28.193
Is it, uh, a panther?
There's no need to decide.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.197
Hey, nice pillow.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.242
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

00:36.244 --> 00:39.413
Hey, excellent water-table thing.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.874
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.209
It makes me want to pee.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.005
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge. Heh.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.634
Hey, how come, uh,
Chandler didn't come?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.722
Well, uh, it's because he had
a thing with the...

00:56.890 --> 00:58.057
With the thing.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.186
Right. I got it.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.647
Why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

01:05.815 --> 01:06.899
Yeah.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.069
Uh, oh, oh, the best part. Come on.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.823
Huh?

01:15.742 --> 01:17.659
Hey.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.704
Nice toilet.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.623
No, no, no. Behind it.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.542
- You have a phone in here?
- That's right.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.002
I have a phone.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.129
In here.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.049
- Joey, promise me something.
- Yeah.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.468
Never call me from that phone.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.905
Okay, here we go.

02:37.866 --> 02:42.369
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.415
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You are not gonna believe this.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.459
I have just been discovered.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.548
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.386
Anyway.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.307
Promise you won't freak out
and say how great this is until I'm done.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.558
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.936
Uh, I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

03:08.104 --> 03:11.106
...who said, ahem, that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

03:11.274 --> 03:14.651
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

03:16.613 --> 03:18.822
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.
Ha, ha.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.365
Okay.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.951
And she wants to do a video.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.830
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.458
God. Okay.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.712
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.800
- I'm done now.
- Oh, that's great.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.303
That's unbelievable. Oh.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.890
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.851
- Get the what?
- There's a pie in the hood. Go.

03:55.193 --> 03:59.112
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.326
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

04:04.494 --> 04:07.037
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.545
Damn it, Ross.
Get your butt out of the bathroom.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.757
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.303
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.847
What's going on?

04:26.015 --> 04:28.558
Uh, your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.644
It's like I'm living with him again.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.897
He's here when I go to sleep,
when I wake up, when I wanna shower.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.650
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.736
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.947
Get out, you doofus!

04:44.617 --> 04:47.786
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.708
All yours.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.627
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.755
I hope
you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.924
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.509
Cut it out.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.184
I've never wanted you more.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.656
So, what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

05:31.205 --> 05:32.748
You know what they say:

05:32.915 --> 05:35.083
Ask your slippers a question...

05:36.419 --> 05:38.670
...you're going crazy.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.302
- Hello?
- Hey.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.553
Hey.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.264
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.640
Oh, that's okay.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.393
You, uh... You had a thing.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.896
Yeah, well,
I hear the place looks great.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.649
Oh, forget about it.
I'm having a ball, ha.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.610
How's the apartment doing?

06:01.778 --> 06:05.280
Oh, hey, it's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

06:06.783 --> 06:08.492
...fest.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.828
Oh, well, great.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.080
Yeah, I just...

06:13.915 --> 06:15.916
...wanted to call and say hey.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.502
Well, okay, then.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.421
Was that the oven timer?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.465
That's right, my friend.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.760
- It's time for Baywatch!
- Baywatch!

06:29.639 --> 06:30.722
Oh.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.308
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.061
I can't believe
they promoted her to lieutenant.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.399
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.610
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.988
Hey. Hey, they're running.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.201
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.328
I say always keep them running.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.623
All the time running.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.669
Run.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.463
Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.384
But you wanted to live by yourself.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.303
I did. I thought it'd be great.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.682
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.436
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.940
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.067
You really think he'd take me?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.236
We had a good talk last night...

07:26.487 --> 07:28.697
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.491
I promise you,
he would definitely want you back.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.035
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.498
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night. Heh.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.375
I mean, it was...

07:40.543 --> 07:43.628
It was like when we first
started living together.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.840
Look, I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

07:47.008 --> 07:51.011
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.264
He's decorated.

07:55.057 --> 07:59.227
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

07:59.395 --> 08:03.148
No, you're just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're just friends now.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.774
You're not...

08:05.485 --> 08:06.651
...roommates anymore.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.739
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?

08:11.073 --> 08:12.741
Okay. Ahem.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.579
Smelly cat, smelly cat

08:17.747 --> 08:20.540
What are they feeding you?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.709
Smelly, smelly, smelly

08:22.877 --> 08:24.211
Really bad smelling smelly cat

08:24.378 --> 08:25.587
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

08:29.050 --> 08:30.884
I mean, like, who was that?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.097
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.849
Oh.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.769
Oh, I thought
they were just watching me.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.606
- Like at an aquarium, you know?
- All right.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.693
- From the top.
- Okay. Ahem.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.072
Smelly cat, smelly cat

08:52.281 --> 08:55.033
What are they feeding you?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.743
Smelly, smelly, smelly

08:56.911 --> 08:58.620
Really bad smelling smelly cat

08:58.788 --> 09:00.247
It's not your fault

09:00.414 --> 09:01.498
Okay, sorry.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.333
I'm just not getting...

09:03.501 --> 09:05.835
...that everyone, um, gets...

09:06.003 --> 09:09.297
...how smelly this cat actually is.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.383
Maybe if we could talk about this...

09:11.551 --> 09:15.178
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.431
Honey, we can talk about this.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.685
It's just that it's costing
about $100 a minute to be in here.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.604
Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

09:26.607 --> 09:30.110
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.237
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.824
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.243
Yeah. Yeah.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.036
Oh, were you taking a nap?

09:40.204 --> 09:42.038
- I was.
- Oh, I...

09:42.206 --> 09:44.958
Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.251
Hello?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.462
Yeah, she's here,
but, uh, can she call you back?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.172
Okay, thanks.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.507
Call Joanna. Hi.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.883
Did she leave a number?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.386
Did you see me write one down?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.931
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.269
Well, she'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.812
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.315
- Look, you wanna get off my back?
- Get out of my face.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.192
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.111
Hello?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.654
Hi.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.532
Yeah, no, she's right here.
Um, hold on.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.784
Hi, Tony, can I call you back?

10:19.952 --> 10:22.621
That's, uh...
That's my sister's boyfriend.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.497
Give me that.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.499
Okay.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.796
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave
my diaphragm at your place?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.258
Hi, Mom.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.276
Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.282
So, uh, how's the palace?

11:00.117 --> 11:03.995
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking...

11:04.163 --> 11:05.830
What's with the boxes?

11:05.998 --> 11:10.418
Oh, uh, actually,
I, uh, have some news.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.422
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

11:15.299 --> 11:19.344
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.679
Nice to meet you.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.722
- Likewise.
- How you doing?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.224
Uh, I'll take that.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.686
It's, uh, what I came for, heh.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.272
So this is new.
Where'd you two meet?

11:31.440 --> 11:35.193
At the, uh, supermarket
in the, uh, ethnic-food section.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.404
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.864
- It's a... I mean...
- Wow.

11:40.074 --> 11:44.160
We got to talking. And, uh, he needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.788
Oh, now it's a spare room?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.957
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

11:49.125 --> 11:51.209
...and I have it to spare.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.585
Right.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.881
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.720
I'll, uh... I'll see you guys.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.140
Hey, Joe.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.975
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.563
Is this guy great, or what?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.648
Yeah.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.400
Yeah, he is.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.243
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is this guy?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.203
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.207
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.918
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.838
Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.633
- It's "Smelly Cat," the video.
- Oh, God.

12:41.218 --> 12:45.889
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

12:46.056 --> 12:48.683
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.022
Okay.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.903
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

13:07.119 --> 13:10.955
- Oh, smoking.
- Oh, look at me.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.833
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:14.585 --> 13:17.545
What are they feeding you?

13:17.880 --> 13:21.382
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:21.550 --> 13:25.345
It's not your fault

13:28.390 --> 13:29.724
Smelly, smelly, smelly

13:29.892 --> 13:32.852
Really bad smelling smelly cat
It's not your fault

13:33.354 --> 13:35.855
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:36.023 --> 13:38.191
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.401
I sound amazing!

13:43.656 --> 13:46.199
They won't take you to the vet

13:46.367 --> 13:48.660
You're obviously not their favorite pet

13:48.828 --> 13:51.412
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:51.580 --> 13:53.498
It's not your fault

13:55.376 --> 13:56.543
Oh, no

13:56.710 --> 13:59.128
I've never heard myself sing before.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.006
I mean, except in my own head. Oh.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.051
This is so cool.
Now I can hear what you hear.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.930
Pretty, uh, different, huh?

14:09.098 --> 14:12.851
Oh, I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.397
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:17.565 --> 14:19.858
It's not your fault

14:30.661 --> 14:32.537
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.080
Eddie.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.416
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.752
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.464
- Where's the mail?
- Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.217
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.094
No, Eddie likes it over there.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.894
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs à la Eddie, huh.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.521
Ooh. Ooh.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.692
Oh, oh. That's great.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.360
Huh.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.070
What?

15:06.238 --> 15:08.156
I thought you liked your eggs...

15:08.324 --> 15:11.659
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, à la me.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.830
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.290
Well, you guys...

15:18.000 --> 15:19.626
...I'm out of here.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.419
See you, pals.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.087
See you.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.260
- So how are you two getting along?
- Oh, I couldn't be happier.

15:29.678 --> 15:30.970
Great, huh?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.222
I'm happy for you.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.560
All right, that's it!

15:38.687 --> 15:42.607
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

15:44.526 --> 15:46.736
...with his moving the mail and his:

15:46.904 --> 15:48.905
"See you, pals."

15:51.533 --> 15:53.201
And now there's no juice!

15:53.369 --> 15:56.704
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

15:58.332 --> 16:00.249
There's another carton
right over there.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.963
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.339
All right.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.632
So, what's it about?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.759
Eggs.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.637
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine, huh?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.556
- Well, I like both eggs equally.
- Oh, come on!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.101
Nobody likes
two kinds of eggs equally.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.436
You like one better,
and I wanna know which.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.314
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.485
You took your eggs, and you left!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.446
Did you really expect me
to never find new eggs?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.701
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.495
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.998
- Ugh.
- Would you guys stop?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.125
- It's my TV!
- What?

16:42.292 --> 16:43.543
- Quit it.
- Bite me!

16:43.711 --> 16:44.794
Oh, my God.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.963
Well, Monica keeps changing
the channel.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.591
Aw, that's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.886
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

16:54.054 --> 16:56.723
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

16:56.890 --> 16:59.642
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.687
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

17:02.855 --> 17:06.023
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

17:09.194 --> 17:10.319
What do we do about this?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.530
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.781
Not that!

17:13.949 --> 17:15.700
This! Us!

17:15.867 --> 17:18.493
Oh, my God, Ross, it's... You're just...

17:18.662 --> 17:21.247
- Since you've been here, you're driving...
- Ow, ow.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.666
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

17:25.085 --> 17:28.087
I just can't stand you being here...

17:28.255 --> 17:29.505
...all the time!

17:29.673 --> 17:32.800
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.343
We're just having fun.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.180
Fun? You think this is fun?

17:37.347 --> 17:38.431
Yeah.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.018
I thought we were fooling around,
like when, uh... When we were kids.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.103
I hated you when we were kids.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.066
- You hated me when we were kids?
- Yes.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.484
I hated you.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.236
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-I-have-to way...

17:52.404 --> 17:54.405
...but basically, I hated your guts.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.200
Why did you hate me?

17:57.367 --> 18:00.244
Because you were mean to me...

18:00.412 --> 18:03.873
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.251
That wasn't fun for you?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.254
Uh-huh.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.466
I can't believe you hated me.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.178
But now I love you.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.265
And not just because I have to.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.725
Really?

18:22.893 --> 18:24.393
Yeah.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.231
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.153
I can do that.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.156
- Then I won't have to kill you.
- Ha, ha.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.121
So you wanna watch, uh,
Entertainment Tonight?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.164
Yeah, thanks.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.333
Tonight, America's premier
sports magazine...

18:47.543 --> 18:48.626
...moves to primetime...

18:48.794 --> 18:50.586
- You know what?
- What?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.714
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.050
Oh, okay.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.433
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.228
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

19:07.396 --> 19:10.857
...but, ahem, that is not me
singing on the video.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.526
No.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.111
Yes.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.779
Well, how did you find out?

19:16.947 --> 19:21.325
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

19:21.493 --> 19:25.288
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.373
So, what are you gonna do?

19:27.541 --> 19:30.084
I can't work with people
who would do this.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.460
Sure.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.171
I mean, this poor woman.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.339
What woman?

19:35.507 --> 19:36.716
The voice woman.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.886
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.805
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.974
I have a video. Pay attention.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.022
No, this voice woman,
she's so talented.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.649
But according to the producer people...

19:53.817 --> 19:57.528
...they said, like, she doesn't have
the right look or something. You know?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.947
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

20:00.115 --> 20:02.366
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.954
Or, you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and...

20:07.122 --> 20:09.207
Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!

20:12.002 --> 20:14.712
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.549
Hey, Eddie.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.593
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?

20:20.761 --> 20:23.512
No, thanks, man.
I'm not, uh... Not really into sports.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.728
Yeah, okay. All right.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.774
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.776
Oh, what?

20:37.444 --> 20:38.861
You like that show?

20:41.448 --> 20:42.615
You don't?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.617
Ha, ha, what...? No.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.703
I mean, it's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.456
Well, that's the brilliance of it.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.627
The pretty people.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.755
And the running.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.260
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.304
Oh, oh. Okay, man.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.738
Smelly cat, smelly cat

22:03.905 --> 22:05.781
What are they feeding you?

22:05.949 --> 22:06.991
Everybody!

22:07.159 --> 22:09.994
Smelly cat, smelly cat

22:10.162 --> 22:12.496
It's not your fault

22:12.664 --> 22:14.040
Monica.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.624
They won't take you to the vet

22:15.792 --> 22:17.418
Chandler.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.839
You're obviously not their favorite pet

22:22.007 --> 22:23.090
Joey.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.010
You may not be a bed of roses

22:26.178 --> 22:28.637
And you're no friend
To those with noses

22:30.265 --> 22:35.102
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Sorry. Okay. Back to the chorus.
