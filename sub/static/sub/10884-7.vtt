<i>- Previously on</i> Stitchers...
- Cameron met a girl.

00:06.389 --> 00:07.935
- Camille: <i>And?
- Her name is Nina.</i>

00:07.960 --> 00:10.214
I would actually love to meet Nina.

00:10.239 --> 00:10.891
Oh.

00:10.916 --> 00:13.180
Trust me, I am so far from perfect.

00:13.205 --> 00:15.182
Wouldn't know that by the
way this guy talks about you.

00:15.207 --> 00:17.015
Do you want to discuss
that wall in your bedroom?

00:17.040 --> 00:19.172
Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.

00:19.197 --> 00:20.256
Does Kirsten know you're here?

00:20.281 --> 00:21.506
I'd rather she not know.

00:21.531 --> 00:23.965
Liam believes my joining
his gym was a coincidence.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.912
You weren't at the university
library last night.

00:25.937 --> 00:26.819
Of course I was.

00:26.844 --> 00:28.534
Straight up, were you there?

00:28.559 --> 00:29.833
No.

00:29.859 --> 00:32.215
Wait, that's weird. There's a boy here.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.873
What happened in that
stitch when you went silent?

00:33.898 --> 00:35.396
Nothing. Cameron?

00:35.421 --> 00:38.488
I was created in the form of
someone your subconscious trusts.

00:38.513 --> 00:39.805
- What's your name?
- Kirsten.

00:39.830 --> 00:40.716
I'm Cameron.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.174
You can't be real.

00:42.199 --> 00:44.399
Young Cameron: <i>There's something
waiting for you at your doorstep.</i>

00:44.424 --> 00:45.689
<i>When you go home and see what it is,</i>

00:45.714 --> 00:47.065
<i>you'll know I am.</i>

00:55.566 --> 00:58.222
_

01:01.928 --> 01:03.716
More midnight graffiti?

01:04.715 --> 01:06.236
Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.

01:06.261 --> 01:08.660
Oh, you didn't. Leftover enchilada did.

01:08.685 --> 01:09.851
She was screaming my name.

01:09.876 --> 01:11.147
Hm.

01:11.265 --> 01:13.361
So what happens when you
run out of wall space?

01:13.386 --> 01:14.899
Start tagging the bathroom?

01:14.924 --> 01:18.295
Uh, well no. Hopefully, I'll
have found my father by then.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.361
Go back to sleep.

01:22.387 --> 01:23.881
Okay.

01:23.905 --> 01:25.700
Here's hoping I have my favorite dream.

01:25.725 --> 01:27.457
What's that?
You, Jon Snow, and Beyoncé?

01:27.482 --> 01:29.607
- That's the one.
- Mm-hmm.

01:46.109 --> 01:47.623
Anna?

01:50.447 --> 01:52.220
Anna?

01:54.634 --> 01:56.114
Anna!

01:56.139 --> 01:57.305
Anna!

01:57.330 --> 01:58.695
Anna!

01:58.720 --> 02:00.734
Oh, no.

No history of health issues.

02:32.003 --> 02:36.395
I get that a young woman doesn't just drop
dead at work, but why are we on this case?

02:36.451 --> 02:40.182
This law firm's client base includes
billion-dollar corporations,

02:40.439 --> 02:43.966
U.S. government agencies,
as well as entire countries.

02:43.991 --> 02:47.042
Countries? What's a

02:47.067 --> 02:50.382

Sam.

02:55.025 --> 02:56.157
I'm a partner.

The NSA's on this?

02:58.581 --> 03:00.017
You know I'm NSA?

03:00.042 --> 03:02.768
I've heard a thing or two
about you the past 20 years.

03:02.793 --> 03:04.814
(chuckles) It has not been that long.

03:04.839 --> 03:07.558
Sure as hell couldn't
tell by looking at you.

Yeah, I'm sorry. Fisher,
this is Sam Lewis.

He's an old friend.

03:17.274 --> 03:18.540
Detective.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.530
What can you tell us about Anna?

03:21.428 --> 03:23.024
(sighs)

03:23.049 --> 03:24.916
She was wonderful.

03:24.941 --> 03:27.731
She was bright, dedicated.

03:27.756 --> 03:29.093
This is terrible.

03:29.571 --> 03:31.682
Anna had such a promising future.

03:32.426 --> 03:33.949
She have problems with anyone?

03:33.973 --> 03:35.269
Not that I'm aware of.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.956
You think someone killed her?

03:36.981 --> 03:38.881
We're not sure at this point.

03:38.906 --> 03:41.089
Whatever I can do to help...

03:41.621 --> 03:43.127
just let me know.

03:43.732 --> 03:45.838
Thanks, Sam. We'll be talking.

03:45.863 --> 03:49.937
I'm sorry it's for this reason,

04:09.667 --> 04:12.669
You saw me pretending to restock
that bin just to talk to you?

04:12.694 --> 04:13.793
Exactly.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.070
Someone's full of himself.

04:15.095 --> 04:16.050
Oh, it's called confidence.

04:16.075 --> 04:18.195
It's part of my charm. Always has been.

04:18.339 --> 04:19.939
That's why you're so attracted to me.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.333
Well, that and...

04:23.514 --> 04:26.051
I've missed too many
opportunities in the past,

04:26.076 --> 04:27.620
and I didn't want to miss you.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.708
Careful, you keep talking like
that I might fall in love with you.

04:31.733 --> 04:33.712
We both know it's too late.

04:34.263 --> 04:35.444
You're smitten.

04:35.469 --> 04:36.859
Okay.

04:39.051 --> 04:40.484
(phone chimes)

04:40.509 --> 04:41.841

Oh!

04:48.889 --> 04:52.064
Hey, look, do-over on
breakfast? Tonight?

04:52.764 --> 04:53.797
- You're on.
- Okay.

04:53.822 --> 04:56.249
I'll make my world famous
Horchata French toast.

04:58.383 --> 04:59.955
Tell Kirsten I say hey.

05:01.921 --> 05:04.567
And I was just restocking that bin.

05:04.592 --> 05:06.428
Sure you were.

05:09.837 --> 05:13.906
Um, so I ordered Anna Parker's cell
phone records and personal emails.

05:13.931 --> 05:15.498
Mm-hmm.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.273
Fisher checked her family, friends,
neighbors. There's nothing amiss there.

05:19.877 --> 05:21.311
Okay.

05:22.732 --> 05:25.299
Look, Linus,
I know I misled you about the library...

05:25.324 --> 05:26.457
Lied.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.455
You lied to me.

05:31.458 --> 05:35.124
It has nothing to do with you.

05:35.149 --> 05:36.644
Then who does it have to do with?

05:36.670 --> 05:37.836
(sighs)

05:37.861 --> 05:39.184
You know what?

05:39.543 --> 05:41.691
Just forget about it.

05:42.664 --> 05:44.077
Okay.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.767
Is there a problem?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.745
Nope.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.495
Oh, there's our little mermaid.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.603
Ayo?

05:55.199 --> 05:58.376
Hey, hold on. What exactly do
you plan to do with that thing?

05:58.401 --> 06:00.428
Cameron's asked me to do
a pre-stitch physical.

06:00.453 --> 06:01.433
Oh, like hell.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.838
Look, I'm not an idiot, okay?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.228
I know something's been going on
inside those last few stitches,

06:05.253 --> 06:07.744
and since you're not willing to
share that information with me,

06:07.769 --> 06:10.398
at least I can make sure you're
physically okay to stitch.

06:10.423 --> 06:12.314
- I'm fine.
- Fine, really?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.398
You went all Banksy on
the wall of your bedroom.

06:14.423 --> 06:16.657
You insist that you've been seeing
some little kid in your stitches.

06:16.682 --> 06:17.960
You're a lot of things, Kirsten.

06:17.985 --> 06:19.563
Okay? But fine's not one of them.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.809
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.132
You know what?
There were 300 lawyers and support staff

06:23.157 --> 06:25.023
that worked with Anna
at the firm every day.

06:25.048 --> 06:28.857
That's a lot of potential suspects to narrow
down, so let's just get on with it. Okay?

06:30.303 --> 06:31.911
Stations, everyone.

06:37.719 --> 06:39.285
Kirsten: Anna's at the firm.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.538
She's with four other lawyers.

06:46.911 --> 06:48.410
They're going through a
mountain of documents.

06:48.435 --> 06:49.500
Taking notes.

06:51.606 --> 06:53.272
Can she identify the case?

06:53.297 --> 06:54.496
Can you see what the case is?

06:56.967 --> 06:58.533
All the boxes say

06:58.558 --> 07:00.762
Fugate versus Newberry Automotive.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.535
Newberry Electric Cars are gaining
heat in the Eco-car industry.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.298
Yeah, not so much when
their batteries blow up.

07:06.323 --> 07:09.034
Fugate versus Newberry is
a personal injury lawsuit.

07:09.059 --> 07:11.558
Mother and three children
were severely injured

07:11.583 --> 07:13.223
when the battery in
their car caught fire.

07:13.252 --> 07:15.712
And the firm is defending
Newberry in the case.

07:15.737 --> 07:17.290
Someone new is here.

07:17.315 --> 07:19.953
Hey, hey, Chief!

07:20.881 --> 07:23.572
Expensive suit,
handsome in an older-guy way.

07:23.597 --> 07:25.097
Sam Lewis, senior partner.

07:25.122 --> 07:27.336
And he's not that old.

07:28.274 --> 07:31.695
Stopped by to thank Anna for
the help on the depo prep.

07:32.602 --> 07:34.845
Don't worry, you'll
all get your chance...

07:34.870 --> 07:37.183
when I think you're ready.

07:37.986 --> 07:40.070
Hey, Anna, great job.

07:40.095 --> 07:41.976
Anna was Sam's favorite.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.101
Suck-up.

07:43.126 --> 07:46.342
The other lawyers didn't like that.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.396
Um, Sam?

07:49.421 --> 07:52.899
I found a memo from Bonnie Newberry
to her lead production engineer.

07:53.543 --> 07:56.034
She knew the batteries could be deadly,

07:56.447 --> 07:58.372
but she kept making them anyway.

07:58.397 --> 08:01.121
It says there that
the cost of safety modifications

08:01.145 --> 08:02.424
would have put them out of business.

08:02.449 --> 08:06.098
- And that memo was written before the...
- Before the Fugate accident.

08:07.579 --> 08:09.480
Good save.

08:10.302 --> 08:12.021
This could have killed us at trial.

08:12.046 --> 08:14.749
Sam, Newberry has to settle the case.

08:14.773 --> 08:15.973
Stop production.

08:15.998 --> 08:17.777
Make the batteries safe.

08:17.802 --> 08:21.540
Hey, it's not our place to tell our
client how to run their business.

08:21.598 --> 08:23.340
It's our job to defend them.

08:25.908 --> 08:27.905
Kirsten, we're on the move.

08:32.927 --> 08:35.291
Hey, Anna.

08:35.510 --> 08:39.765
I want to go over that memo you found
with Ms. Newberry, but I can't find it.

08:40.496 --> 08:42.696
Oh, you took it with you, remember?

08:45.563 --> 08:47.344
I have no idea how that got there.

08:47.369 --> 08:49.092
I'm sure it was an oversight.

08:49.554 --> 08:52.202
Ms. Newberry, you have
to settle the case,

08:52.227 --> 08:54.082
recall the batteries. If you don't...

08:54.108 --> 08:58.504
What? Tell me, with your vast business
experience what happens if I don't?

08:58.529 --> 09:00.554
Anna just pissed off the client.

09:00.579 --> 09:02.352
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

09:02.377 --> 09:04.277
Anna's a bit eager.

09:05.105 --> 09:06.696
It's a rookie mistake.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.900
That rookie is off my case.

09:09.359 --> 09:11.057
Well, I can't do that.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.293
That's my best associate.

09:22.091 --> 09:24.749
Young Cameron: Believe in me now?

09:25.843 --> 09:27.246
(beeping)

09:27.271 --> 09:28.976
There it is again. The anomaly.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.423
Can you get a trace on it?

09:30.448 --> 09:31.748
I know how to do my job.

09:32.442 --> 09:33.773
Kirsten: <i>I got your note.</i>

09:33.798 --> 09:35.220
What are you doing
here, what do you want?

09:35.245 --> 09:37.702
I have something important to tell you.

09:37.727 --> 09:39.166
Kirsten, what's going on?

09:39.192 --> 09:41.681
I'm running a trace, but Kirsten only
has 20 seconds left in the stitch.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.302
Move her to the moment of death.

09:43.689 --> 09:46.039
Hey, I... I wasn't done there.

09:46.064 --> 09:47.937
No time. 12 seconds, what do you see?

09:52.904 --> 09:54.717
I...

09:55.448 --> 09:56.547
Anna's...

09:56.572 --> 09:58.777
Dying. Kirsten, make the bounce!

10:06.821 --> 10:09.243
So as she was dying,

10:09.268 --> 10:12.633
Anna was dizzy, she had chest pains,
and everything went all yellow.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.238
It sounds like she was poisoned.

10:14.263 --> 10:15.276
Um, I did some research.

10:15.301 --> 10:17.674
Apparently, Bonnie
Newberry left a string

10:17.698 --> 10:20.565
of figurative bodies in her wake
on her rise in the auto industry.

10:20.590 --> 10:23.651
Yeah, Anna found a memo
proving Newberry was guilty.

10:23.676 --> 10:25.728
Flat-out told her to settle.
Newberry was pissed.

10:25.753 --> 10:27.256
She wanted her off the case,

10:27.280 --> 10:28.399
Sam said no.

10:28.424 --> 10:31.218
Maybe she didn't want to
take no for an answer.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.691
I know your time is short Mrs. Newberry.

10:39.716 --> 10:40.881
So I'll get down to it.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.515
About Anna Parker's murder.

10:42.552 --> 10:45.419
Awful. Anna was such
a lovely young girl.

10:45.455 --> 10:47.020
I really enjoyed working with her.

10:47.056 --> 10:48.056
Really?

10:48.931 --> 10:50.463
Where were you last night?

10:50.488 --> 10:52.413
Maggie, is your agent
implying something?

10:52.438 --> 10:54.811
It's okay, Sam, I don't mind answering.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.574
I was home. I had dinner guests.

10:57.599 --> 10:59.233
Feel free to check with them.

10:59.268 --> 11:01.034
Were you happy with Anna's work?

11:01.070 --> 11:03.737
She seemed to be a brilliant woman.

11:03.772 --> 11:05.405
Eager, always helpful.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.604
Hmph, please.

11:06.629 --> 11:09.419
Ms. Baptiste, if your associate has
something to say, let's hear it.

11:09.444 --> 11:11.675
No, I'm sorry about that.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.187
Did Anna express any
concern about your case?

11:15.212 --> 11:18.275
Communications between attorney and client
are privileged, Maggie, you know that.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.733
Then generally.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.833
How was your interaction with Anna?

11:22.748 --> 11:25.199
We had some spirited discussions.

11:25.224 --> 11:26.986
- More like all-out brawls.
- Hold on.

11:27.011 --> 11:29.601
You and Anna argued two
days before she was killed.

11:29.626 --> 11:31.093
- I can't let...
- You wanted her off the case.

11:31.128 --> 11:32.007
- Don't respond to that.
- You were worried

11:32.032 --> 11:33.768
Anna had information that
could sink your company.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.841
- I don't like what you're implying.
- What am I implying?

11:35.866 --> 11:37.732
- Bonnie, don't.
- That I killed Anna.

11:37.757 --> 11:39.436
- Did you?
- We're done here.

11:41.402 --> 11:43.007
Bonnie.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.548
How's your day goin'?

11:55.912 --> 11:57.843
You and your girl blind-sided me.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.749
Trust me, she is her own girl,

11:59.774 --> 12:01.440
but we need to find
out what happened here.

12:01.465 --> 12:03.678
Sorry, I have an obligation
to protect my client,

12:03.703 --> 12:05.769
who your agent just accused
of being a murderer.

12:05.794 --> 12:08.964
Uh-uh, no, Ms. Newberry brought
that up first all by herself.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.122
Any idea why?

12:10.147 --> 12:11.779
Yeah, because she didn't kill Anna.

12:11.804 --> 12:14.486
Listen, I indulged you

12:14.511 --> 12:16.010
when you requested this interview.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.508
I really want to help
you find Anna's killer,

12:17.533 --> 12:18.967
but that display in there?

12:18.992 --> 12:20.317
Wow, Mags.

12:20.342 --> 12:21.575
Not cool.

12:21.611 --> 12:23.497
So not cool.

12:24.214 --> 12:25.806
There he is.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.949
The mono-syllabic Sam you used to know?

12:28.974 --> 12:30.427
No, the cool Sam.

12:30.452 --> 12:33.853
And look at you now, the
winner-takes-all lawyer you've become.

12:33.889 --> 12:36.723
Said by the NSA hard-ass you've become.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.710
How'd you know about that disagreement?

12:40.862 --> 12:43.180
NSA hard-ass, remember?

12:43.205 --> 12:44.323
No, no, no, no, no.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.977
If one of my associates talked
to the NSA out of school,

12:47.002 --> 12:48.668
you have the obligation to inform me.

12:48.888 --> 12:50.221
Anna didn't.

12:50.439 --> 12:52.790
But someone did kill her.
Come on, help me out here.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.114
Bonnie's now off limits,

12:54.164 --> 12:55.464
but tell me what you need.

12:55.489 --> 12:57.763
Records, files, whatever.

12:57.788 --> 12:59.298
You got it, I have nothing to hide.

12:59.323 --> 13:01.179
You couldn't even if you tried.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.784
Hard-ass.

13:05.136 --> 13:08.053
Beautiful hard-ass, but still...

13:10.949 --> 13:13.352
Oh, double espresso.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.794
Kirsten never has a second cup at home.

13:16.554 --> 13:19.177
<i>Airplane?</i> It's that major motion pic...

13:19.202 --> 13:20.356
Why are you so ragged?

13:20.381 --> 13:21.814
Oh. (laughs)

13:21.839 --> 13:23.795
Why are you always judging me?

13:23.819 --> 13:26.634
I'm not, I just want you to know that
you can still talk to me about things.

13:26.659 --> 13:27.824
Oh, like in-stitch anomalies?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.453
Like anything.

13:32.948 --> 13:34.934
I know I can still talk to you.

13:34.959 --> 13:36.225
Good.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.460
Okay?
'Cause nothing's ever gonna change that.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.784
Thank you.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.705
You're welcome.

13:46.002 --> 13:47.385
Hey.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.396
Anna's tox screen came back.
She was poisoned with oleander.

13:50.421 --> 13:51.411
Death by flower?

13:51.436 --> 13:54.513
It's a shrub. Grows everywhere
around SoCal. It's poisonous.

13:54.538 --> 13:57.210
Lab says there was a fairly tight
window from ingestion to death

13:57.235 --> 13:58.935
and that it was most
likely in liquid form.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.112
Uh, like an iced tea?

14:00.137 --> 14:01.370
Hm, mm-mm.

14:02.492 --> 14:03.524
Ew.

14:03.549 --> 14:05.095
Excuse me if I want to live.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.852
There was no tea at the crime scene.
Are you sure?

14:06.877 --> 14:08.989
There was a glass in front
of Anna when she died.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.822
The killer must have removed it.

14:10.847 --> 14:11.930
Should I be worried?

14:11.955 --> 14:13.287
- No.
- How do you know?

14:13.312 --> 14:15.962
Because you're not dizzy
or seeing yellow halos.

14:15.987 --> 14:17.170
Or dead.

14:17.951 --> 14:20.685
So, Anna got the tea here at the firm,

14:20.710 --> 14:22.740
someone at the firm got to her tea.

14:22.765 --> 14:25.098
One of the associates Anna worked with,
maybe?

14:25.123 --> 14:27.825
All right, let's divide and conquer,
see what we can squeeze out of them.

14:27.850 --> 14:29.930
And keep the results of the
tox screen to yourselves.

14:32.910 --> 14:34.577
Anna and I were work friends.

14:34.602 --> 14:39.192
You know, like, "How was your weekend?
Mine with the fam was awesome."

14:39.241 --> 14:41.777
Did she have any problems
with anyone here?

14:41.802 --> 14:43.377
(phone chimes)

14:44.532 --> 14:46.169
Oh, that's Danska, the nanny.

14:46.194 --> 14:48.854
She's taking the baby to Griffith
Park for the pony and train rides.

14:48.879 --> 14:52.081
I'll just text, tell her not
to forget the hand sanitizer.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.351
Then I'm all yours.

15:13.899 --> 15:16.473
So did you notice anything
suspicious last night?

15:16.498 --> 15:19.799
When you're focused on your work,
Camille, do you notice anything else?

15:19.824 --> 15:22.158
I'm a multi-tasker, Jen.

15:22.183 --> 15:24.624
Just like you apparently. So did you?

15:24.700 --> 15:26.366
Notice anything out of the ordinary?

15:26.391 --> 15:28.239
Like what?

15:28.566 --> 15:33.758
Like maybe someone near Anna's
office around the time she died.

15:33.783 --> 15:36.500
Perhaps your client, Bonnie Newberry?

15:36.525 --> 15:38.291
Why are you asking me
about Bonnie Newberry?

15:38.316 --> 15:40.755
Why are you answering all of
my questions with a question.

15:41.225 --> 15:42.534
Am I?

15:44.224 --> 15:47.297
You know us lawyers. Deflect. Avoid.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.422
Lie.

15:48.856 --> 15:50.679
That reminds me of a joke.

15:50.704 --> 15:52.356
How do you know when a lawyer's lying?

15:52.381 --> 15:53.838
How?

15:53.863 --> 15:55.969
His lips are moving.

15:55.994 --> 15:59.321
But seriously, all I'm allowed to
say is what's in court filings,

15:59.346 --> 16:03.189
that Anna and I were working together
for Bonnie Newberry on the Fugate matter.

16:03.214 --> 16:06.649
And on this case, by any chance, did
Anna piss some people off along the way?

16:07.071 --> 16:09.379
I really want to help you, Linus,

16:09.404 --> 16:11.174
but all I can say is that...

16:11.199 --> 16:14.301
That you and Anna were working
together with Bonnie Newberry.

16:14.802 --> 16:16.610
On the Fugate matter.

16:16.635 --> 16:18.001
Yeah.

16:19.185 --> 16:20.759
Randall Cooke, here.

16:20.784 --> 16:22.318
Agent Goodkin, NSA.

16:22.343 --> 16:23.909
I'm late, I know.

16:23.934 --> 16:25.798
The Yale alum meet and greet went long.

16:25.894 --> 16:28.762
What can I do you for
Agent Goodkin, NSA?

16:28.787 --> 16:29.924
(chuckles lightly)

16:29.949 --> 16:35.386
"Please pick up those gluten-free

16:35.411 --> 16:38.981
"cookies. Thanks." Send.

16:39.006 --> 16:40.138
(Kirsten clears throat)

16:40.163 --> 16:41.630
You married? Kids?

16:41.655 --> 16:42.357
No.

16:42.382 --> 16:44.074
Too bad, are you dating anybody?

16:44.099 --> 16:45.414
No. Now about the...

16:45.439 --> 16:46.981
So sad.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.014
Look, we know that Anna
was upset about the

16:49.039 --> 16:51.374
faulty batteries Newberry
was manufacturing.

16:51.399 --> 16:54.532
So we know that she wanted to stop
your client from hurting people.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.257
Why would you think I
would know about that?

16:56.282 --> 17:00.151
If you do not stop answering
my questions with a question,

17:00.176 --> 17:04.974
I promise I will hack you and sext every
judge in Los Angeles from your account.

17:06.955 --> 17:08.936
Oh, that's better. Thank you so much.

17:08.962 --> 17:12.972
Okay. So, could Anna have been
making an end run around your client

17:12.997 --> 17:15.059
and gotten herself killed because of it?

17:15.458 --> 17:17.527
If we may, let's get back to the part

17:17.551 --> 17:20.787
where an NSA operative
threatened a private citizen.

17:22.044 --> 17:23.549
Randall: <i>It was horrible,</i>

17:23.574 --> 17:24.917
finding her like that.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.733
You ever see a dead body, Agent Goodkin?

17:28.227 --> 17:30.028
Occasionally.

17:30.219 --> 17:34.287
Now I understand that Anna wanted
Newberry to settle. Is that true?

17:36.547 --> 17:38.228
From where are you inferring that?

17:38.253 --> 17:39.586
Little bird told me.

17:39.611 --> 17:40.777
Really?

17:40.870 --> 17:42.937
Well, let's get your
little bird in here.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.496
Because <i> actori incumbit onus proband.</i>

17:45.521 --> 17:48.894
The burden of proof falls on the
party who advances the proposition.

17:49.653 --> 17:52.227
That would be you and your little bird.

17:52.252 --> 17:55.622
Sorry, I am not at liberty to say.

17:55.647 --> 17:59.115
I signed a confidentiality agreement
when I started here, and...

17:59.140 --> 18:00.785
All communications we've
had about our case,

18:00.810 --> 18:02.347
the people they allegedly injured,

18:02.372 --> 18:05.571
and how our client was or was not
responding to the complaint...

18:05.596 --> 18:07.883
Are covered by
attorney-hyphen-client privilege.

18:07.908 --> 18:10.515
California CCP prohibits
me from discussing that.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.600
Am I a suspect?

18:11.624 --> 18:14.542
Because if I am,
I'm gonna take the fifth on that...

18:14.567 --> 18:17.267
And invoke my constitutional
right against self-incrimination.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.921
I think it's time I lawyer up.

18:19.096 --> 18:21.682
There. I just hired myself.

18:21.707 --> 18:24.744
And myself advised me
to tell you jack...

18:24.769 --> 18:26.489
On that note, you need to leave.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.799
By the way,
have you thought about getting a dog?

18:28.824 --> 18:31.325
This way, you won't
be so lonely and sad.

18:39.507 --> 18:40.707
I hate lawyers.

18:40.732 --> 18:41.798
So what'd you get?

18:41.823 --> 18:42.821
Nothing.

18:42.846 --> 18:44.178
For the next 24 hours,

18:44.203 --> 18:46.378
no one respond to me with a question.

18:46.403 --> 18:47.469
Why?

18:47.505 --> 18:50.639
Those bloodsuckers have
no respect for the badge.

18:50.674 --> 18:52.007
I take it you got nothing too?

18:52.042 --> 18:53.675
Oh, guys, I got something.

18:53.710 --> 18:56.453
Yeah, I learned Latin from the most
arrogant, entitled, asshat I've ever met.

18:56.478 --> 18:57.877
Okay, everyone, just breathe.

18:57.902 --> 19:00.270
We will find Anna's
killer in spite of them.

19:00.295 --> 19:03.735
Okay, well, on that high note,
I should get going on that research.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.369
Where are we with Anna's
refractory period? Be careful.

19:07.394 --> 19:09.228
Uh, tomorrow morning, at the earliest.

19:09.624 --> 19:11.870
How dangerous is the research?

19:11.895 --> 19:14.427
The records I promised
are ready for your review.

19:14.452 --> 19:16.059
Thank you.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.895
And by my review, he means yours.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.342
See what you can find,
nothing's too small.

19:22.141 --> 19:23.680
Oh, guys, um...

19:23.910 --> 19:25.898
I had dinner plans.

19:25.923 --> 19:27.589
I told Nina I work in video games

19:27.614 --> 19:29.927
and she's already wondering why I
spend so much time at the office.

19:29.952 --> 19:32.089
We're talking about
solving somebody's murder.

19:32.121 --> 19:33.458
No, no, no, it's fine. We got it.

19:33.483 --> 19:35.531
- No, Linus is right, actually...
- No, yeah, we got this.

19:35.556 --> 19:36.604
Are you sure?

19:36.919 --> 19:40.554
Yeah. Uh... besides, you'd
probably just slow us down anyways.

19:40.589 --> 19:42.510
Awesome, thanks guys.

19:44.438 --> 19:46.743
I mean, how long could it take?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.790
We really should call Cameron back.

19:54.508 --> 19:57.813
No. No, he had plans with Nina.

19:58.714 --> 19:59.813
We can do this.

19:59.838 --> 20:01.405
Anna just died.

20:01.430 --> 20:04.297
There's no way all of this could have
been generated between then and now.

20:04.322 --> 20:05.335
Yeah, it wasn't.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.642
They're just burying us
in work to screw with us.

20:10.096 --> 20:12.482
Right, well, look for
anything that tells us

20:12.507 --> 20:14.841
who was in the office around
the time that Anna was poisoned.

20:14.866 --> 20:15.865
Okay.

20:15.890 --> 20:17.603
(phone chimes)

20:20.540 --> 20:22.750
Well, it was not Bonnie Newberry.

20:22.975 --> 20:24.808
Fisher just confirmed
she was out that night.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.299
I guess we can cross her
off our list of suspects.

20:27.335 --> 20:28.767
Well, that's something.

20:28.802 --> 20:30.402
Yeah, or not.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.867
You know, maybe she had someone
at the firm poison Anna.

20:36.582 --> 20:41.056
We got phone logs for
all 1,200 employees

20:41.081 --> 20:45.117
for the entire week
leading up to the murder.

20:45.152 --> 20:49.286
Yeah, and this is keycard records
for all eight floors of the firm

20:49.311 --> 20:51.011
for the past two weeks.

20:51.046 --> 20:53.113
I really, really hate lawyers.

20:53.148 --> 20:56.129
So glad I didn't go to law
school like my father wanted.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.439
You? A lawyer?

20:58.464 --> 20:59.797
I don't see it.

20:59.822 --> 21:00.731
Yeah, me neither.

21:00.755 --> 21:02.358
I mean, I got accepted everywhere,

21:02.384 --> 21:04.763
but science has always been my jam.

21:07.928 --> 21:10.742
So Nina and Cameron
together doesn't bother you?

21:11.201 --> 21:14.483
No. No, I'm really happy for them.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.794
I think Camille's seeing someone.

21:20.819 --> 21:22.812
Where did that come from?

21:23.831 --> 21:25.263
Last week.

21:25.528 --> 21:28.262
She told me she had to study,
but then she wasn't at the library,

21:28.287 --> 21:29.619
where she said she would be.

21:29.644 --> 21:32.224
And tonight she has to do
mysterious research for Maggie.

21:34.328 --> 21:35.932
I don't think she's dating anyone.

21:35.957 --> 21:38.056
I mean, she'd tell me if she was.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.440
Oh.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.170
You guys save any for me?

21:44.931 --> 21:47.414
Got as far as my car and realized
I can't leave you two alone

21:47.439 --> 21:48.531
to do all this by yourselves.

21:48.556 --> 21:50.196
- Sure, you can.
- No, he can't.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.820
Please, grab a box.

21:51.845 --> 21:52.740
Ha!

21:52.765 --> 21:54.536
You can't bail on Nina.

21:54.562 --> 21:56.402
Too late. Already did.

21:56.446 --> 21:59.329
Wasn't my finest relationship moment,
but, uh,

21:59.354 --> 22:00.996
I think she gets it.

22:03.107 --> 22:04.439
Oh!

22:04.464 --> 22:06.387
What I don't get is why
someone in the mail room

22:06.412 --> 22:08.500
called the psychic hotline 85 times.

22:09.804 --> 22:11.635
All right.

22:14.218 --> 22:16.018
(giggling)

22:16.466 --> 22:19.787
Well, thank you for
walking me to my door.

22:19.812 --> 22:21.947
And they say chivalry's dead.

22:22.494 --> 22:24.368
Don't I get an invite?

22:25.192 --> 22:27.314
You said Kirsten was
working late tonight, right?

22:27.339 --> 22:29.398
That's plenty of time
for a quick nightcap.

22:29.494 --> 22:31.279
I don't do quick.

22:31.304 --> 22:32.503
Me neither.

22:32.876 --> 22:35.849
But I will if it gives me
20 more minutes with you.

22:39.562 --> 22:41.203
One drink.

22:41.883 --> 22:44.683
We're out of wine. Is beer okay?

22:44.708 --> 22:47.232
Perfect.

22:48.696 --> 22:51.838
Looks like I have an IPA or a lager.

22:51.863 --> 22:52.886
What are you in the mood for?

22:52.912 --> 22:54.012
Something different.

22:54.079 --> 22:55.745
Liam, I... I can't.

22:55.770 --> 22:57.601
Kirsten, she's...

22:57.626 --> 22:58.881
But it's not about her.

22:58.906 --> 23:00.038
It's about me and you.

23:00.063 --> 23:02.091
I know,
I've just been worried about her lately.

23:02.116 --> 23:04.625
She's been so caught up
trying to find her father.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.226
Really? Why now?

23:09.333 --> 23:11.629
He left when she was young.

23:11.654 --> 23:13.648
She wants to get to
know him, and I've been

23:13.673 --> 23:15.673
helping her track him down.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.163
Maybe I can be helpful.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.520
Really?

23:18.545 --> 23:21.180
I can be very resourceful
if I'm motivated.

23:22.461 --> 23:23.460
Liam,

23:23.485 --> 23:24.684
this isn't a good idea.

23:24.709 --> 23:27.176
- No...
- (light switch clicks)

23:36.289 --> 23:37.289
Kirsten!

23:37.314 --> 23:39.294
Hey. No no no. Hold on.
Kris, let me explain myself.

23:39.319 --> 23:42.635
Oh. Oh, okay. Explain to me why you're
hooking up with Liam in my kitchen?

23:42.660 --> 23:44.092
Okay, uh, we ran into each other

23:44.117 --> 23:45.278
in the gym, we...

23:45.303 --> 23:46.768
When did you even get back?

23:46.793 --> 23:47.716
I never left.

23:47.741 --> 23:49.843
We got to talking,
one thing kind of lead to another,

23:49.868 --> 23:51.989
Camille and I have a real connection.

23:52.946 --> 23:54.146
Right.

23:55.486 --> 23:58.761
You know, Linus just asked me if you
were seeing someone behind his back,

23:58.786 --> 24:00.677
and I stuck up for you, I said no.

24:00.702 --> 24:04.517
It... I...
I didn't mean to hurt Linus or you,

24:04.542 --> 24:05.775
that's not what this is.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.101
Right. How is secretly seeing
my ex-boyfriend not hurting me?

24:09.126 --> 24:11.025
Hey, the last I checked,
you broke up with me.

24:11.464 --> 24:13.917
So we don't have to
justify ourselves to you.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.440
Fine.

24:16.465 --> 24:19.236
Whatever.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.502
(door slams)

24:25.527 --> 24:29.050
I think you need to go.

24:34.346 --> 24:36.365
(elevator door dings)

24:37.202 --> 24:39.231
You couldn't have gone
through everything last night.

24:39.256 --> 24:40.802
We didn't, we're fried.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.748
But we'll pick up again after we stitch.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.849
We did find something, though.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.940
Anna made a call from her office to
the plaintiff who's suing Newberry.

24:49.965 --> 24:52.433
Well, that's unethical.
She could be disbarred for that.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.117
Did you at least narrow
the field of suspects?

24:56.548 --> 24:58.181
Kirsten!

24:58.778 --> 25:02.603
The only other associates
who used their keycards

25:02.628 --> 25:05.404
to access Anna's floor
around the time she died was

25:05.429 --> 25:08.728
Jen, Randall, Morgan, and Christine.

25:08.753 --> 25:11.718
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that there
was nobody else who got up there.

25:13.372 --> 25:14.906
Hey, guys.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.672
Uh, sorry I'm late, I was just...

25:16.697 --> 25:18.169
Anna's gonna hit her best by date.

25:18.194 --> 25:20.309
We're stitching in five minutes.

25:22.043 --> 25:23.662
What happened?

25:23.687 --> 25:26.751
Kirsten caught me with Liam last night.

25:26.837 --> 25:30.082
Not with-him with him, just with him.

25:30.107 --> 25:31.940
Did you tell her the truth?

25:31.965 --> 25:33.098
No.

25:33.123 --> 25:34.044
Good.

25:34.069 --> 25:36.707
Is it?

25:39.410 --> 25:40.921
Communications.

25:40.946 --> 25:42.345
Go!

25:42.370 --> 25:43.670
Com check one, two, one two.

25:43.695 --> 25:44.404
I hear you.

25:44.429 --> 25:46.349
Mission clock set to
five minutes, please.

25:47.592 --> 25:50.064
Okay, let's see if we
can handle the truth.

25:50.089 --> 25:55.868
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one, mark!

26:02.786 --> 26:06.022
(moaning)

26:13.765 --> 26:17.381
Anna just caught Randall making
out with a woman in the break room.

26:17.406 --> 26:18.780
Can you see who?

26:21.012 --> 26:22.793
No.

26:27.864 --> 26:31.347
Morgan: Are we really going to let Ms.
Goody Two Shoes blow the whole case for us?

26:31.372 --> 26:33.343
Seriously, what's her deal?

26:33.368 --> 26:35.906
She does that, how're we going
to keep our billables up?

26:36.857 --> 26:38.424
Different memory.

26:38.449 --> 26:42.005
Anna just walked in on the other associates
talking about her behind her back.

26:42.030 --> 26:45.257
Oh, yeah? Why? 'Cause she was
doing her job and doing it well?

26:45.282 --> 26:48.049
And did they ever once
give her an ounce of credit

26:48.074 --> 26:50.492
for being on their side, by their side,

26:50.517 --> 26:53.081
protecting them, just trying to do...

26:54.438 --> 26:56.133
Just...

26:57.040 --> 26:59.040
Just trying to do her job.

26:59.065 --> 27:01.403
Did Kirsten hear what the other
associates were saying about Anna?

27:01.428 --> 27:02.907
What were they saying?

27:04.529 --> 27:06.340
Kirsten!

27:09.048 --> 27:10.857
We don't have much time,

27:10.882 --> 27:12.580
so listen to me carefully.

27:13.137 --> 27:14.496
Kirsten?

27:14.521 --> 27:15.839
(beeping)

27:15.864 --> 27:17.278
I'm picking up the anomaly again.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.925
Find the source.

27:20.637 --> 27:22.590
You have a sister.

27:24.781 --> 27:26.169
Kirsten?

27:27.038 --> 27:29.001
Um, Cameron, I'm sorry.

27:29.026 --> 27:32.169
Uh, any one of them could have
wanted Anna out of their way.

27:32.194 --> 27:33.744
<i>My parents had another daughter?</i>

27:33.769 --> 27:37.053
Your father did with his first wife,
Elizabeth.

27:39.668 --> 27:43.059
Anna's memories are fizzling.
Only one memory hotspot is registering.

27:43.084 --> 27:44.084
Okay, let's get there.

27:44.109 --> 27:45.743
What's her name?

27:45.769 --> 27:46.902
Her name's...

27:46.927 --> 27:47.750
Kirsten, we're on the move.

27:47.775 --> 27:49.717
No, wait! What's her name?

27:49.742 --> 27:51.127
Not enough time, brace yourself.

27:51.152 --> 27:53.165
Her names Ivy Brown.

27:55.748 --> 27:57.931
Damn it, Cameron!

27:58.073 --> 28:01.067
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.
Is there some place you wanted to be?

28:01.092 --> 28:03.190
No, it's okay.

28:03.216 --> 28:07.419
I'm back in the same memory I
saw last time. Newberry's here.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.957
The anomaly's gone.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.035
Are you out of your damn mind?

28:15.060 --> 28:17.411
You trying to destroy
this firm? Destroy me?

28:17.436 --> 28:18.669
Sam, I'm sorry.

28:18.694 --> 28:20.038
I don't give a flying crap.

28:20.063 --> 28:21.931
That family was hurt.

28:21.956 --> 28:23.355
That's not our problem.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.035
But they're telling the truth.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.096
We don't represent them, Anna.
Our job is to...

28:27.121 --> 28:28.892
Let our clients kill people?

28:28.917 --> 28:30.007
No.

28:30.032 --> 28:33.181
To represent our client to
the fullest extent possible.

28:33.535 --> 28:36.535
If we don't, we can be sued,
sanctioned, or disbarred.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.090
Do not blow this, or I...

28:39.402 --> 28:41.870
_

28:42.526 --> 28:43.791
You scanned the memo?

28:43.816 --> 28:45.613
N...

28:45.638 --> 28:47.579
You sent it to the <i> LA Times?</i>

28:47.604 --> 28:49.599
- I...
- What the hell were you thinking?

28:49.986 --> 28:52.599
(alarm beeping)

28:53.592 --> 28:55.160
Memory collapse imminent.

28:55.185 --> 28:57.381
Anna's done, Kirsten, make the bounce.

29:00.692 --> 29:03.149
Anna wrote an email to the <i> LA Times.</i>

29:03.174 --> 29:04.786
She attached the incriminating memo.

29:04.811 --> 29:05.849
Did Sam know?

29:05.874 --> 29:07.115
Yeah, he threatened her.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.273
That doesn't sound like Sam. I know him.

29:09.298 --> 29:11.798
Yeah, knew him 20 years
ago. People change.

29:11.823 --> 29:14.589
The associates hated Anna,
because she was the best of all of them.

29:14.614 --> 29:15.744
And Sam was mad

29:15.768 --> 29:18.213
because she had a conscience
that was interfering with the case.

29:18.939 --> 29:20.586
I'll talk to Sam.

29:20.611 --> 29:23.807
Yeah, but how do we get the
others to talk? The sharks?

29:23.832 --> 29:25.717
We throw some blood in the water

29:25.742 --> 29:28.654
and watch them eat themselves.

29:39.418 --> 29:40.651
(door closes)

29:42.724 --> 29:44.257
Uh-oh.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.117
I've seen that look before.

29:47.346 --> 29:51.093
When I put my darks in with your
whites and ruined half your wardrobe.

29:53.184 --> 29:55.909
Yeah, this goes way beyond laundry.

29:58.244 --> 30:00.477
Did you kill Anna?

30:00.695 --> 30:02.719
You got into it with her
over Newberry because

30:02.744 --> 30:04.626
she didn't like what
your client was doing.

30:04.651 --> 30:07.885
You knew she had sent an
email to the <i> Times</i> with proof

30:07.910 --> 30:09.870
Newberry's batteries were dangerous.

30:10.192 --> 30:12.721
Firstly, I deny
everything you just said.

30:13.217 --> 30:16.124
Secondly,
even if everything you said was true,

30:16.149 --> 30:17.916
none of it is admissible in court

30:17.941 --> 30:20.322
until you fully disclose how
you came about this information.

30:20.347 --> 30:21.544
Thirdly,

30:21.569 --> 30:25.290
the NSA seems dangerously close
to violating the Fourth Amendment.

30:25.315 --> 30:28.508
And finally,
all emails generated by my employees

30:28.533 --> 30:30.882
are work product and
therefore confidential.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.695
Did I leave anything out?

30:33.720 --> 30:34.720
Yes.

30:36.016 --> 30:38.435
The part where you tell
me if you killed Anna.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.031
You can't believe that, can you?

30:44.992 --> 30:46.815
I knew about the email.

30:47.291 --> 30:49.225
That email would have
destroyed your case,

30:49.250 --> 30:50.757
ruined your career.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.299
If it had been sent.

30:52.419 --> 30:54.183
But it wasn't.

30:55.272 --> 30:57.280
She swore she didn't
write it, she thought

30:57.305 --> 30:59.720
someone around here was
trying to sabotage her.

31:00.017 --> 31:01.756
It was just a draft.

31:02.102 --> 31:03.901
I checked the system.

31:04.431 --> 31:05.977
Mags...

31:06.150 --> 31:08.204
I didn't kill her.

31:18.054 --> 31:19.775
Then one of your associates.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.233
Hm!

31:22.174 --> 31:24.229
They may be killers on the job,

31:24.254 --> 31:25.820
but real killers?

31:27.243 --> 31:28.443
No way.

31:30.853 --> 31:33.011
(sighs)

31:35.699 --> 31:37.105
Randall: Ah.

31:37.130 --> 31:38.930
Agents Goodkin and Clark,

31:38.955 --> 31:40.955
back for seconds, I see.

31:43.408 --> 31:45.163
We're all here like you wanted.

31:45.188 --> 31:46.197
Here's what we know:

31:46.222 --> 31:49.703
Bonnie Newberry drafted a memo saying
she knew her batteries were dangerous.

31:49.728 --> 31:51.182
Someone stole it from Sam's office

31:51.207 --> 31:52.869
and planted it with Anna's paperwork.

31:52.894 --> 31:54.034
To further mess with Anna,

31:54.059 --> 31:56.773
someone got on her laptop and
drafted an email to the <i> LA Times,</i>

31:56.798 --> 31:57.801
attaching that memo.

31:57.826 --> 31:59.299
Snarky comment?

31:59.324 --> 32:00.556
Anyone?

32:02.737 --> 32:04.136
What a surprise.

32:04.161 --> 32:06.367
Hm. Two days before Anna was murdered,

32:06.392 --> 32:07.759
there was a fifteen second phone call

32:07.784 --> 32:08.865
that came from inside of her office

32:08.890 --> 32:11.131
to a Mrs. Fugate,
the woman who's suing Newberry.

32:11.156 --> 32:12.421
Phone records from the firm.

32:12.446 --> 32:13.780
Anna's cellphone records,

32:13.806 --> 32:16.264
which show that she couldn't
have called the plaintiff

32:16.289 --> 32:17.790
because at that exact time,

32:17.815 --> 32:21.324
she was on her cell ordering take-out
because she was working late. Again.

32:21.349 --> 32:23.316
<i>Ergo...</i> that's Latin for "therefore"...

32:23.341 --> 32:24.930
Someone not Anna made the call.

32:24.955 --> 32:26.466
Someone who wanted to discredit her.

32:26.491 --> 32:28.232
Cameron: That certain
someone is one of you.

32:28.257 --> 32:31.563
Now, if any of you know who it is, you
have the moral obligation to tell us.

32:38.312 --> 32:40.668
You two are precious. I mean it.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.868
Was this your whole plan?

32:41.893 --> 32:44.809
To bore a confession out of us?

32:52.178 --> 32:54.818
Good on you for all that fancy research.

32:54.843 --> 32:56.110
Sit down, Randall. We're not done.

32:56.135 --> 32:57.858
Oh, I know, we're not.

32:57.883 --> 32:59.740
Because I did some research too.

32:59.765 --> 33:02.899
And a little free advice, Agent Goodkin,

33:02.924 --> 33:05.858
you might wanna step down
from your moral high ground.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.114
Considering...

33:07.139 --> 33:08.171
Considering?

33:08.196 --> 33:09.395
Wait.

33:09.434 --> 33:11.912
Your daddy didn't teach you morality,
did he?

33:13.892 --> 33:15.623
Oh.

33:16.380 --> 33:17.880
You didn't know.

33:18.184 --> 33:20.557
Care to share your
daddy issues with her?

33:20.582 --> 33:21.651
One of you murdered Anna.

33:21.676 --> 33:23.615
Looks like I struck a nerve.

33:23.847 --> 33:25.722
What's he talking about?

33:25.747 --> 33:27.588
His father is James Miller.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.815
The man behind the $3
billion Ponzi scheme

33:29.840 --> 33:32.387
that wiped out how many
people's life savings, Goodkin?

33:32.412 --> 33:33.544
This isn't about me...

33:33.569 --> 33:35.459
Dad's not getting out of
Lompoc any time soon, is he?

33:35.602 --> 33:39.303
What is it, another, what,
14 years left to go?

33:39.404 --> 33:40.971
Meanwhile,

33:40.996 --> 33:43.174
you're sitting pretty in a fancy loft,

33:43.199 --> 33:45.817
spending all that money he stole.

33:45.842 --> 33:47.922
Cameron, Cameron.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.403
I love this guy. I'm serious.

33:52.819 --> 33:54.446
Son of a bitch.

33:54.471 --> 33:55.470
Forget Randall, okay?

33:55.495 --> 33:56.694
My father, really?

33:56.719 --> 33:57.610
- My father?
- Hey, calm down.

33:57.635 --> 33:58.906
Look, he's not even in my life.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.088
You don't have to explain to me.

34:00.113 --> 34:02.099
Yeah, I do, okay. That money?
It came from my mother's side.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.031
Then she got divorced and I
changed my last name to hers.

34:04.056 --> 34:05.189
I get it.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.110
Look, I'm not my father.

34:08.136 --> 34:11.245
No. I know you're not.

34:13.126 --> 34:15.101
We both have, um,

34:15.746 --> 34:18.760
criminal, absent, pathetic fathers.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.387
Except the only difference is
you're desperate to find yours

34:21.411 --> 34:23.303
and all I want to do is forget mine.

34:23.422 --> 34:25.931
Hey. Fisher called, guess what he found?

34:25.956 --> 34:27.013
The source of the oleander.

34:27.038 --> 34:29.079
Now, for double or nothing,
guess what I found.

34:29.103 --> 34:30.670
Our very own "smoking gun"?

34:30.696 --> 34:34.838
A whole freakin', sizzling, armory.

34:41.351 --> 34:43.775
Wow. Welcome back Agent Goodkin.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.199
Sorry about before,

34:45.224 --> 34:48.168
I didn't realize how raw the
whole daddy-in-jail thing is.

34:48.194 --> 34:50.690
Oh, it's okay.
One of you can say hi to him for me.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.094
Keycards on the table, please.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.992
No questions.

34:54.016 --> 34:56.197
You heard the man. Keycards, now.

34:56.559 --> 34:59.515
So, back to the phone
call to that plaintiff.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.127
While we were going
through that mountain of

35:01.152 --> 35:02.702
paperwork that you tried
to choke us with,

35:02.727 --> 35:04.621
we came across the keycard logs

35:04.645 --> 35:07.256
which happen to track every move
you make in and out of the building.

35:07.281 --> 35:09.484
Hello, handsome. What? What's that?

35:09.509 --> 35:11.075
You want me to tell them what?

35:11.100 --> 35:12.992
Oh, okay. I got it.

35:13.017 --> 35:16.084
Don't you just love keycard logs?
Here's the dealio.

35:16.109 --> 35:18.275
According to this hunk
of burning love here,

35:18.382 --> 35:20.189
only one of you

35:20.214 --> 35:22.469
was in the building last
Tuesday at 3:00 a.m.,

35:22.494 --> 35:26.147
when the call was made to the
plaintiff from Anna's office.

35:26.172 --> 35:30.007
Eeny, meany, miney... mommy.

35:30.032 --> 35:31.263
That's impossible.

35:31.288 --> 35:33.585
My husband was away,
I was home with my baby.

35:33.610 --> 35:35.943
At your house?
Where according to our investigator,

35:35.968 --> 35:37.943
there just happens to
be a poisonous shrub.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.820
Did we mention Anna was poisoned?

35:39.844 --> 35:41.727
Christine, don't say another word.

35:42.269 --> 35:43.874
- Maya?
<i>- Mr. Cooke?</i>

35:43.899 --> 35:45.695
Tell Sam we need him in the
conference room right away.

35:45.720 --> 35:46.720
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

35:46.745 --> 35:49.440
Are you acting as Christine's
lawyer or as a concerned friend?

35:49.465 --> 35:50.564
Right now, both.

35:50.590 --> 35:52.815
Hm, you, a friend? Doubt it.

35:53.327 --> 35:55.715
Where were you really at
the time of that call?

35:55.740 --> 35:57.369
Don't answer.

36:01.538 --> 36:03.596
Oh, that's a nice bracelet.

36:04.012 --> 36:06.356
Did your, um, husband give that to you?

36:06.381 --> 36:09.572
Or do you think he's gonna
want it back when he finds out

36:09.597 --> 36:12.169
that you and Randall
have been hooking up?

36:12.814 --> 36:15.198
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

36:15.700 --> 36:19.258
Where were you at the time of that call?

36:20.188 --> 36:23.408
Randall would do anything to be a star.
He's used you.

36:24.172 --> 36:26.116
You took my card.

36:26.141 --> 36:28.432
That night, you made that call.

36:28.456 --> 36:29.823
Stop talking.

36:29.848 --> 36:31.464
You always hated Anna.

36:31.489 --> 36:32.335
Shut up.

36:32.361 --> 36:34.428
You did everything you
could to make her look bad.

36:34.452 --> 36:36.449
I swear, Christine,
if you don't shut your mouth...

36:36.475 --> 36:38.979
- I'm gonna...
- What? You're gonna kill me too?

36:45.551 --> 36:47.286
You have zero evidence.

36:48.131 --> 36:50.054
I did not kill Anna.

36:50.268 --> 36:53.050
I did not poison her with oleander.

36:53.098 --> 36:55.419
How did he know she was
poisoned with oleander?

36:55.444 --> 36:56.939
We didn't mention that, did we?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.142
Nope.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.912
Sam, I'd like to retain your services.

37:00.937 --> 37:03.437
Cameron: He's about to be arrested and
charged for the murder of Anna Parker.

37:03.462 --> 37:04.762
You want to lawyer up?

37:04.787 --> 37:07.010
Go elsewhere.

37:08.155 --> 37:09.851
(gasps)

37:10.352 --> 37:11.452
Drop it!

37:11.477 --> 37:14.501
You told us to do anything
to win the Newberry case.

37:14.526 --> 37:15.714
Anything legal.

37:15.739 --> 37:17.307
Maggie, feel free to shoot that douche.

37:17.332 --> 37:20.226
Anna was going to blow the lid
on what Newberry was doing.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.405
She was gonna ruin everything,
and I couldn't let that happen.

37:23.430 --> 37:25.254
I was protecting our client.

37:25.279 --> 37:26.444
Look, I...

37:26.469 --> 37:30.313
I thought that oleander would
just make her sick. I measured it.

37:30.338 --> 37:32.626
Look, I didn't mean to kill her.

37:34.916 --> 37:36.600
Well, if you're not gonna shoot him.

37:36.625 --> 37:38.993
- (grunts)
- (groans)

37:43.938 --> 37:45.476
Poor guy.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.715
Please don't say it.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.623
- They're gonna throw the book at him.
- Oh, god, that's awful.

37:56.157 --> 37:58.782
I was too much about the win.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.472
Well, Randall Cooke is not
a killer because of you.

38:03.638 --> 38:04.970
Yeah.

38:04.995 --> 38:07.497
I should have listened to Anna sooner.

38:07.674 --> 38:10.411
I spoke with Bonnie Newberry,
convinced her to settle.

38:10.436 --> 38:12.625
I'm not sure she's gonna be
able to salvage her company,

38:12.650 --> 38:15.960
but at least no one
else is gonna get hurt.

38:17.470 --> 38:19.942
There he is.

38:28.692 --> 38:31.826
Promise not to ask you about
your dad or if you're okay.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.558
I'm okay.

38:35.052 --> 38:39.064
So then do you want to go to dinner
and talk about how very okay you are?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.036
I can't.

38:41.206 --> 38:42.705
Nina.

38:43.133 --> 38:44.912
Nina, mm-hmm.

38:44.937 --> 38:48.468
Um, tell her I say hey.

38:54.252 --> 38:56.238
Detective.

38:56.423 --> 38:58.228
You did good work, kiddo.

38:58.354 --> 39:01.155
Phew, I'm just glad somebody thinks so.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.376
Come again?

39:05.233 --> 39:08.447
It's nothing, sorry. Thank you, Fisher.

39:09.044 --> 39:12.380
What's going on with you? Are you okay?

39:13.215 --> 39:15.757
Yeah, maybe one day I'll
tell you all about it.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.205
Maybe.

39:19.885 --> 39:22.443
Okay, the job's over,
are you gonna talk to me now?

39:22.468 --> 39:24.295
Well, that depends on...

39:26.476 --> 39:28.203
- Linus.
- Dad.

39:28.228 --> 39:30.819
Mr. Ahluwalia? Hi.

39:31.045 --> 39:34.398
Samir, please. Good to see you, Camille.

39:34.423 --> 39:35.833
Dad, what are you doing here?

39:35.858 --> 39:37.992
I could ask you the same question.

39:38.027 --> 39:41.161
Mr. Ahluwalia, right on time as usual.

39:41.196 --> 39:43.062
This must be your son.

39:43.098 --> 39:45.064
I didn't think you could
make it to sign the document.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.366
What document?

39:46.401 --> 39:48.534
The medical power of attorney.

39:51.316 --> 39:53.565
We need to talk.

39:56.413 --> 39:58.424
(dog barks)

40:06.441 --> 40:09.500
I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?
Again.

40:09.639 --> 40:12.294
You wanted to be the one to tell her,
so tell her.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.381
Camille has been seeing
Liam on my orders.

40:18.254 --> 40:21.789
I didn't realize that you had the power
to order other people to sleep around.

40:21.814 --> 40:23.779
It never got that far.

40:23.804 --> 40:26.482
I think that Liam has been
working with your father.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.341
Camille is trying to get
that information out of him.

40:29.377 --> 40:31.719
(scoffs) What?

40:31.850 --> 40:34.514
Wait, you're saying
that the whole time...

40:35.288 --> 40:37.210
he was seeing me...

40:37.476 --> 40:39.928
The proposal was fake?

40:40.838 --> 40:44.193
We're trying to find out if Liam
was setting you up for something.

40:44.494 --> 40:46.667
I haven't gotten anything yet.

40:47.608 --> 40:50.272
Listen, Kirsten,
just tell me what you want me to do.

40:50.297 --> 40:52.630
'Cause I'll call it quits right
now if that's what you want.

40:52.666 --> 40:54.111
It's your choice.

40:54.500 --> 41:00.270
We'll find Stinger some other way.

41:04.941 --> 41:07.706
I don't want you to see Liam anymore.

41:09.245 --> 41:11.047
It's too dangerous.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.169
I'll do it.
