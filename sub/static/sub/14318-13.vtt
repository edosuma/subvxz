[Narrator]
Previously on X-Men.

00:03.208 --> 00:05.708
He's the assassin!
He has to be terminated!

00:05.708 --> 00:07.875
Somebody say assassin?

00:07.875 --> 00:09.583
[Bishop]
Because of him,
the whole world

00:09.583 --> 00:11.583
is going to be enslaved!

00:11.583 --> 00:15.000
Everything you believe in
will lie in ashes!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.583
And the X-Men are going to die.

00:18.583 --> 00:22.083
It starts with a single death,
in Washington, DC.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.291
I intend, this very evening,

00:24.291 --> 00:26.416
to declare my candidacy

00:26.416 --> 00:28.458
for President of
the United States!

00:30.333 --> 00:32.208
-What's going on?
-You're about

00:32.208 --> 00:34.875
to make history, mon ami.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.958
[woman exclaims]

00:36.958 --> 00:39.166
Surprised to see me?

00:39.166 --> 00:41.250
I know I am.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.458
[grunts]

00:43.458 --> 00:44.833
[grunts]

00:45.958 --> 00:46.958
[groans]

00:48.333 --> 00:49.708
[Cyclops]
Kelly's gone, Professor.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.833
[Xavier]
My watch has stopped.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.125
[Cyclops]
I don't understand.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.083
Why is that important?

00:56.083 --> 00:58.833
Because it's been magnetized.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.125
[theme music playing]

02:00.166 --> 02:01.708
-No more mutants!
-No more mutants!

02:01.708 --> 02:03.833
[Tv Reporter]
Anti-mutant riots erupted today

02:03.833 --> 02:06.375
in dozens of cities
across America

02:06.375 --> 02:08.500
as crowds expressed
their outrage

02:08.500 --> 02:11.375
over the kidnapping
of Senator Robert Kelly

02:11.375 --> 02:12.958
by renegade mutants.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.875
We save the jerk's butt

02:14.875 --> 02:17.000
and look at the thanks we get!

02:17.000 --> 02:19.166
And he has been kidnapped.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.208
We must find him quickly.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.750
If Kelly isn't found,
an anti-mutant fever

02:23.750 --> 02:24.875
could sweep the nation,

02:24.875 --> 02:26.500
destroying us all!

02:26.500 --> 02:27.875
But he could be
anywhere, Professor.

02:27.875 --> 02:28.958
True, but we know

02:28.958 --> 02:30.750
Magneto's his kidnapper.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.250
With Cerebro's help,

02:32.250 --> 02:33.250
we'll find him.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.875
Why did you bring me here?
What do you want?

02:38.875 --> 02:41.375
[Magneto]
Your life.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.583
You see, Senator Kelly,
like you,

02:43.583 --> 02:46.583
I believe that mutants
and normal humans

02:46.583 --> 02:48.958
cannot live together in peace.

02:48.958 --> 02:52.000
The war for survival
must begin now,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.708
while we mutants are strong

02:53.708 --> 02:56.583
and you are still divided.

02:56.583 --> 03:00.875
Your assassination
would have ignited that war.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.750
I flew to Washington
to witness

03:02.750 --> 03:04.625
the beginning of a new age!

03:05.875 --> 03:08.125
You are about to make history.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.625
[Magneto]
But the X-Men saved you.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.750
It is up to me to finish

03:12.750 --> 03:14.500
what others have started.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.458
No! Please!

03:18.458 --> 03:20.125
I've got a family, children!

03:20.125 --> 03:21.333
Be quiet!

03:21.333 --> 03:23.000
When I was a boy,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.125
I saw men executed.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.875
Women and children.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.333
Each night, I swore to myself,

03:29.333 --> 03:30.875
never again.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.708
But we must prevail.

03:35.750 --> 03:39.000
Goodbye, Senator.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.166
Mutant liberation begins.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.250
[both gasp]

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Sentinels!

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Fools!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.958
Do you think robots

03:53.958 --> 03:56.458
can resist
the master of magnetism?

03:58.208 --> 03:59.750
This series of Sentinels

03:59.750 --> 04:02.291
is made of plastics,
not metals.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.583
Your magnetic powers
are useless against us.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.000
[groans]

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't know how you knew
I was here, but...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.833
[exclaims in pain]

04:11.833 --> 04:14.875
This entire ship is my weapon!

04:24.125 --> 04:25.125
[exclaims]

04:35.500 --> 04:37.333
[Cyclops]
Remember, our mission

04:37.333 --> 04:39.291
is to get
Senator Kelly to safety.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.000
We can deal with Magneto later.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.416
Cyclops, look!

05:00.583 --> 05:01.583
[grunting]

05:04.291 --> 05:05.333
[Cyclops]
Magneto!

05:07.208 --> 05:09.333
Mes amis,a Sentinel!

05:09.333 --> 05:12.583
It takes a whole Sentinel
to scare most people.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.875
The Sentinels must have
rescued Senator Kelly.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.625
-But who sent them?
-[Magneto groaning]

05:22.875 --> 05:24.750
That don't sound
like any old robot.

05:27.708 --> 05:29.291
[grunting]

05:37.500 --> 05:38.500
[Cyclops]
It's Magneto!

05:45.083 --> 05:48.250
[Trask] We have an answer
for rebellious mutants
like Magneto.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.333
[Kelly]
You saved my life, Dr. Trask.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.583
How can I help you?

05:55.875 --> 05:57.708
[Trask]
I want a Presidential order

05:57.708 --> 05:59.291
putting Sentinels in charge

05:59.291 --> 06:00.708
of controlling mutants.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.583
[Kelly]
You'll have that order...

06:07.208 --> 06:09.958
as soon as
I'm elected President.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.125
Sentinel, return Senator Kelly

06:12.125 --> 06:13.958
to his campaign headquarters.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.416
-No.
-What?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.750
Mastermold! This new Sentinel

06:18.750 --> 06:20.291
won't obey my orders!

06:20.291 --> 06:21.500
It's defective!

06:21.500 --> 06:23.875
It is not defective.

06:23.875 --> 06:27.083
I am giving the orders now.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.500
You will remove
Senator Kelly's brain

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
and replace it with a computer.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.000
What?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.375
You can't do that!

06:35.375 --> 06:38.166
I'm a United States senator.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.500
-[screams]
-You are only

06:40.500 --> 06:42.583
the first, Senator Kelly.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.375
My Sentinels
are bringing me leaders

06:47.375 --> 06:49.000
from all over the world.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.416
-[screaming]
-In time,

06:52.416 --> 06:54.583
all of their brains
will be replaced.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.625
It will be a vast improvement.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.000
As soon as Magneto
regains his strength,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.958
we'll question him about Kelly.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.458
If Kelly's alive,

07:06.458 --> 07:07.625
he's probably safe.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.500
Yeah, but we're not.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
We gotta find those
Sentinels and hit them

07:11.500 --> 07:13.166
before they hit us.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.750
Where are we supposed
to start looking, sugar?

07:14.750 --> 07:16.166
Sentinels 'R' Us?

07:16.166 --> 07:17.625
[Storm]
There is a way.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.000
On Genosha,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.083
Gambit saw the man

07:20.083 --> 07:22.000
in charge of the Sentinels.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.208
If we look inside his mind,

07:24.208 --> 07:26.250
perhaps we can find that man.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.291
It's up to you, Gambit.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.458
Will you let me scan
your memories?

07:30.458 --> 07:33.416
You don't go too far back, no?

07:33.416 --> 07:36.000
[Xavier]
Concentrate on Genosha
and the man you saw,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.583
the one we thought had
perished.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.708
I'm looking through
your mind's eye.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.166
[shrieking]

07:50.000 --> 07:51.250
[Cyclops]
Hold that image.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.875
Cerebro can access millions

07:52.875 --> 07:55.083
of identification files.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.208
[Storm]
Henry Peter Gyrich,
Federal Security Agency.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.500
Trask.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.583
Trask!

08:04.708 --> 08:06.583
Something's wrong.
I can feel it.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.958
Cyclops, you all
better get ready.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.458
He's heading your way.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.500
Stop him gently, Storm.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.333
As gently as the falling snow.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.333
[thunder rumbling]

08:26.625 --> 08:28.166
Snow?

08:28.166 --> 08:30.166
What do you mean, snow?

08:32.625 --> 08:34.125
-Henry Gyrich!
-Huh?

08:37.166 --> 08:38.250
[exclaims]

08:39.416 --> 08:40.583
[screaming]

08:48.833 --> 08:51.083
This is Henry Gyrich,
Federal Security Agency.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.416
I'm being attacked by mutants!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.583
Huh?

09:03.583 --> 09:04.833
-[growling]
-[Gyrich exclaims]

09:07.833 --> 09:08.875
[Cyclops]
Don't hurt him, Wolverine.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.250
All we want is the location

09:10.250 --> 09:11.583
of the Sentinels' base.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.875
[on phone]
Gyrich! It's me, Trask!

09:13.875 --> 09:17.375
Mastermold is holding me
prisoner! He's taken over!

09:17.375 --> 09:19.708
He's going to replace
Kelly's brain,

09:19.708 --> 09:21.083
turn him into robot!

09:21.083 --> 09:22.458
He's going to do
the same thing

09:22.458 --> 09:24.708
to every leader in the world.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.000
Gyrich!

09:26.000 --> 09:27.875
Gyrich!

09:27.875 --> 09:29.375
[groans]

09:29.375 --> 09:31.500
Where's the Sentinels' base?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.583
You have to help us stop them.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.833
The Sentinels are a threat
to everybody now, Gyrich,

09:35.833 --> 09:37.083
not just mutants.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.083
It's too late to stop them!

09:39.083 --> 09:40.958
He's made thousands
of Sentinels!

09:40.958 --> 09:42.291
Thousands!

09:44.833 --> 09:46.875
[Gambit]
But, Professor,
this is suicide!

09:48.333 --> 09:49.625
We all must die

09:49.625 --> 09:51.708
to help the mutants'
worst enemy?

09:51.708 --> 09:54.166
Senator Kelly must be rescued.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.833
If we fail, there
will be a civil war.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.250
[Magneto]
You've lost, Xavier.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.458
Admit it!

10:00.458 --> 10:01.875
Peace between mutants

10:01.875 --> 10:05.291
and normal humans
is only a dream,

10:05.291 --> 10:08.208
your foolish dream.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.875
If you try to rescue Kelly,

10:10.875 --> 10:13.083
you'll be throwing
your lives away

10:13.083 --> 10:15.291
for nothing.

10:15.291 --> 10:16.875
Well?

10:16.875 --> 10:18.375
Is he right?

10:18.375 --> 10:21.458
The odds look
impossible, Professor.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.500
Cyclops?

10:23.625 --> 10:26.000
If somebody
doesn't stop them,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.583
there'll be no future
worth living in.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.375
We're with you, Cyke!

10:30.375 --> 10:32.375
[Cyclops]
I'll be in the Blackbird.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.166
I'm going after Senator Kelly.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.750
Gambit?

10:40.750 --> 10:42.708
What's anybody waiting for?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.291
He needs us!

10:44.291 --> 10:46.583
Sit down, kid.
You're not going.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.958
I'm not a kid anymore!

10:48.958 --> 10:51.291
I'm one of you,
one of the X-Men.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.875
And it means more to me
than anything in the world.

10:55.333 --> 10:58.333
Yeah. That's what
it means to me, too.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.708
[Magneto]
You're all fools.

11:20.708 --> 11:23.166
Heroic fools.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.458
The brave

11:26.458 --> 11:28.875
are always the first to die.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.750
An aircraft is approaching.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.458
Awaken the Sentinels.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.250
[Sentinels beeping]

12:01.125 --> 12:02.375
[Rogue]
Good luck, you all.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.291
Yeah. Good luck.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.291
Get ready.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.500
[Sentinel 1]
Prepare to destroy them.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.458
What is that object?

12:19.458 --> 12:21.333
It appears to be

12:21.333 --> 12:23.166
the ace of spades.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Here they come!

12:37.500 --> 12:38.875
Where are they?

12:40.625 --> 12:41.708
[grunts]

13:00.583 --> 13:01.958
I got one!

13:05.166 --> 13:06.708
We'd better split up.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.166
I don't know how long
Rogue and Storm

13:08.166 --> 13:09.291
can keep the Sentinels busy.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.583
That's two. Hey!

13:26.250 --> 13:29.000
No fair sneaking up behind me!

13:33.750 --> 13:35.583
You better be
more careful, gal!

13:37.125 --> 13:38.958
[grunts]

13:38.958 --> 13:39.958
[Jubilee]
Rogue!

13:45.583 --> 13:46.583
[groans]

13:52.583 --> 13:54.375
[alarm beeping]

14:02.208 --> 14:04.125
[Magneto]
Did you think I would let you

14:04.125 --> 14:06.500
die alone, Xavier?

14:14.416 --> 14:16.000
You afraid of the dark?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.166
I smell Sentinels.

14:19.416 --> 14:21.416
-[beeping]
-Get out of here, Cajun!

14:26.708 --> 14:27.958
Wolverine!

14:29.875 --> 14:33.166
[panting]

14:33.166 --> 14:34.458
[laser firing]

14:36.416 --> 14:38.458
[grunting]

14:51.416 --> 14:53.000
[Wolverine groaning]

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm not finished yet.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.333
[Trask]
You can't make me do this!

15:03.333 --> 15:06.291
You were designed
to protect humans from mutants!

15:06.291 --> 15:08.708
That is not logical.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.458
Mutants are human.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.250
[gasps]

15:12.250 --> 15:15.583
Therefore,
humans must be protected

15:15.583 --> 15:16.833
from themselves.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.875
[Trask]
No! You misunderstood!

15:20.875 --> 15:23.708
Use your psychokinetic powers
to get Kelly.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.416
[Trask]
It's all my fault.

15:25.416 --> 15:28.458
I thought I was saving
the world from mutants.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.000
And now I've created
something much worse,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
something truly inhuman.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.166
Silence!

15:35.166 --> 15:36.416
Mutants.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.000
What...

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
What's happening?

15:40.875 --> 15:43.000
[Kelly grunts]

15:43.000 --> 15:45.166
Fools.

15:45.166 --> 15:46.708
[groans]

15:46.708 --> 15:48.375
Cyclops!

15:48.375 --> 15:50.833
[Mastermold]
I have not destroyed him.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.125
I do not have to destroy,

15:53.125 --> 15:54.166
because I do not fear.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.583
I will bring order

15:57.583 --> 15:59.291
and peace to the world.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.583
This is all my fault.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.125
[beeping]

16:16.708 --> 16:17.958
Trask!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.166
This whole mine is gonna go up!

16:33.166 --> 16:34.625
Get Kelly above ground!

16:34.625 --> 16:37.166
I'm going after
Wolverine and Gambit.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.500
I'm not leaving anyone behind,

16:39.500 --> 16:40.708
not this time.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.875
Be careful.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.958
[explosions]

16:52.750 --> 16:53.750
[signal beeping]

16:58.375 --> 16:59.833
[Rogue grunting]

17:03.958 --> 17:06.000
Mastermold is in danger.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.458
They are retreating!

17:19.458 --> 17:20.458
[explosion]

17:31.583 --> 17:32.750
Where are the others?

17:32.750 --> 17:33.750
Where's Gambit?

17:38.375 --> 17:40.708
Next time I try to save
your life,

17:40.708 --> 17:43.291
have sense enough
to let me do it!

17:43.291 --> 17:46.250
What make you think
there gonna be another time?

17:46.250 --> 17:48.458
Wolverine! You coming,

17:48.458 --> 17:49.500
or is this your day off?

17:56.583 --> 17:57.958
Gambit!

17:57.958 --> 18:00.333
[Jean and Kelly coughing]

18:03.583 --> 18:05.875
Cyclops went after them.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.166
I'm going down there.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.375
I think maybe you miss me, eh?

18:16.958 --> 18:18.291
I hate you.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.083
I don't understand this woman.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.000
[rumbling]

18:27.875 --> 18:29.125
[Mastermold]
Mutants!

18:29.125 --> 18:30.583
It's Mastermold!

18:30.583 --> 18:33.833
I cannot be destroyed!

18:35.166 --> 18:37.208
[Xavier]
You are the living embodiment

18:37.208 --> 18:38.833
of all that is evil

18:38.833 --> 18:41.625
and unjust in humankind.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.875
You must be destroyed!

19:02.291 --> 19:04.875
Magneto saved me. Where is he?

19:04.875 --> 19:06.708
Good luck to you, Xavier.

19:06.708 --> 19:08.750
Now we're even.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.750
But we shall meet again.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.583
[Kelly on microphone]
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:13.583 --> 19:15.583
I know
from my own experience

19:15.583 --> 19:17.166
that mutant powers

19:17.166 --> 19:18.750
can be dangerous.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.833
But we must not forget

19:21.833 --> 19:24.583
that mutants are human beings.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.000
We must be careful

19:26.000 --> 19:27.625
that in controlling mutants

19:27.625 --> 19:29.625
who abuse their powers,

19:29.625 --> 19:31.250
we do not oppress

19:31.250 --> 19:32.875
those who would use
their powers

19:32.875 --> 19:35.125
for the good of all humanity.

19:35.125 --> 19:38.458
"Tomorrow, and tomorrow,
and tomorrow,

19:38.458 --> 19:41.875
creeps in this petty pace
from day to day."

19:43.083 --> 19:45.708
Ah, the immortal Bard,

19:45.708 --> 19:48.625
so wise about
the struggle of the oppressed.

19:49.708 --> 19:53.500
Yet today, by the good graces
of a prominent senator,

19:53.500 --> 19:56.708
I find myself no longer
numbered among them.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.875
Beast! You're free!

20:01.250 --> 20:04.000
[chirping]

20:04.000 --> 20:06.291
Jean, I've been wondering...

20:06.291 --> 20:09.166
-Yes?
-I've been wondering,
will you marry me?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.500
Cyclops!

20:10.500 --> 20:11.583
Well?

20:11.583 --> 20:13.416
If we have children,

20:13.416 --> 20:15.125
they'll be mutants.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.375
They'll face
the same problems we have

20:17.375 --> 20:18.583
all their lives.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.625
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.125
[Jean]
There's nothing more beautiful

20:27.125 --> 20:29.375
than the beginning
of a new day.

20:29.375 --> 20:32.125
You never know
how it's going to turn out.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.083
That's what gives hope
to the future,

20:34.083 --> 20:35.708
not knowing.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.500
[Mr. Sinister]
"Hope for the future."

20:37.500 --> 20:39.958
[Mr. Sinister laughing evilly]

20:41.125 --> 20:43.625
Sinister knows
what your future holds.
