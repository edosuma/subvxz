00:02.820 --> 00:04.740
I'm just sorting my salad.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.380
I'm not on the bus anymore.

00:07.380 --> 00:10.460
Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.880
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.880
It was just a hook up.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.380
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

00:20.640 --> 00:23.040
It was your boyfriend who sent the tip.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.960
My boyfriend didn't even know.
-The little blonde one. Isak?

00:28.020 --> 00:29.560
Isn't that what he's called?

00:33.840 --> 00:38.220
Hello! This is Isak.
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.760
But you can leave a
message after the beep.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.320
Okay, just wait for the beep.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.720
Isak. You better answer the
phone because I need to talk to you.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.940
Hi.
-Hi.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.940
Where's Isak?

01:29.820 --> 01:32.120
Isak is a bit upset.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.960
What happened?

01:37.020 --> 01:41.060
His dad left,
and his mother completely collapsed.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.680
Shit.

01:45.260 --> 01:46.780
Yeah, it's shit.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.320
But, is everything okay?

01:53.540 --> 01:57.120
I don't really know.
His mother was already pretty crazy.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.740
Yeah.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.780
Do you want me to get someone or?

02:10.920 --> 02:14.380
Eh, no. I just wanted to talk to
him about something.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.840
He's not answering his phone.
-I think he turned it off.

02:37.220 --> 02:39.160
How are you doing?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Good!

02:44.060 --> 02:45.040
Or...

02:47.840 --> 02:48.700
You know.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.540
Yeah, I know.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.760
Say hi to him.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.040
Don't you want to come in?
I'm sure he wants to see you.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.760
No, eh. I think...

03:17.680 --> 03:18.760
He has you, so...

03:21.380 --> 03:22.060
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.700
Bye.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.420
Bye.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.100
What's the symbol for porridge?

03:50.080 --> 03:52.500
I'm really struggling here.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.820
"In the barn sits Santa with his Christmas porridge."

03:56.000 --> 03:59.740
What's this porridge?
Porridge is porridge.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.940
Why did you choose this song?
-I thought it was simple.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.340
You have to hand it in next class.
-I know. And I forgot.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.700
Porridge is the symbol of...

04:14.420 --> 04:21.740
Life?
-Life? Fits perfectly. Life.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.460
Did you do it?

04:23.740 --> 04:26.060
What did you use?
-"Deilig er jorden"

04:26.060 --> 04:28.060
Isn't that a really bad song?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.940
It has a beautiful message.

04:31.580 --> 04:36.600
Fuck! Message! What's the
message in "På låven sitter nissen"?

04:36.600 --> 04:37.400
Vilde?

04:38.680 --> 04:39.320
Hi!

04:41.100 --> 04:41.860
Hi.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.700
How's it going with you?
-Really good! With you guys?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.800
Come sit with us.

04:54.360 --> 04:59.760
I would really love to, but me,
Sara, Ingrid, and Pepsi Max are going to the coffee place.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.860
So.. Maybe next time?

05:08.540 --> 05:10.060
How's it going with your bus?

05:10.920 --> 05:11.780
Good.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.680
Did you find a sponsor yet?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.360
Not yet.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.460
It's just one thing. They'll come running soon.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.660
Hi! Are you guys here?
Do you want to eat here?

05:32.780 --> 05:37.820
I'll just go and get my
jacket, I'll be right back.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.080
What happened just now?

06:03.920 --> 06:04.960
Hi.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.300
Hi.

06:07.300 --> 06:12.240
Look out when you go up the stairs.
Me?! It's you who has to look out.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.120
Okay...

06:17.280 --> 06:18.680
How's it going with Isak?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.840
Yeah, it's going better now.

06:21.580 --> 06:26.660
But he's not at school.
No, he's chilling at home for a bit.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.420
Call or text him. He would like that.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.960
Yeah, I'll do that. I forgot.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.020
What do you have now?
-French.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.460
Awkward.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.140
Jonas!

07:01.660 --> 07:03.120
What are you doing?!

07:03.480 --> 07:04.540
Jonas!

07:17.840 --> 07:22.080
Fuck, you have to back me up!
-You hooked up with his girl. If I were him I would've killed you.

07:56.960 --> 07:57.880
Hi!

07:59.240 --> 08:00.180
Hi.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.240
How's it going?

08:04.120 --> 08:06.040
Fine. Or...

08:07.020 --> 08:08.180
It's going great.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.480
How's it going with you?

08:11.080 --> 08:12.400
It's going well.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.520
I dumped Chris.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.300
Did you?
-Hm-hm.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.420
That's good, Iben!
-Yeah.

08:20.020 --> 08:25.440
Also, I'm having a girl power
Christmas party on Friday. You have to come.

08:26.180 --> 08:30.840
Girl power Christmas party?
-Yeah, where no third year guys are invited.

08:30.860 --> 08:31.800
Okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.720
They have too much power
at this school. All the drama is because of them.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.080
Us girls have to start sticking up for each other.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.840
Agreed?
-Agreed.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.960
So, an all girls party?

08:45.260 --> 08:51.040
No, no. We need guys there.
So I thought we could invite first year guys.

08:52.040 --> 08:57.100
They're the most undervalued
group at school.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.980
But come on Friday! Bring your friends.

09:00.980 --> 09:02.020
Yeah, cool!

09:02.160 --> 09:06.020
If you know any delicious
first year guys, invite them.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.760
Yeah, I'll try.
-Okay, good.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.700
But, I was wondering...

09:12.780 --> 09:16.660
Could you maybe ask Vilde if she can come?

09:16.820 --> 09:17.800
Vilde?

09:18.340 --> 09:22.380
Yeah, Vilde Lien.
She's a first year.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.460
Of course. Just take her with you.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.920
I think she'd be happy
if you could invite her.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.400
Yeah, okay! I'll find her on Facebook.

09:33.580 --> 09:34.480
Thanks.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.760
I need water!

10:19.220 --> 10:20.780
Have you heard from Vilde?

10:23.680 --> 10:24.420
No.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.700
Have you heard from Vilde?

10:27.700 --> 10:29.420
Eh, no.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.620
Iben, did you invite Vilde?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.800
Yeah, she said she would come.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.220
Check this on snapchat.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.520
Even more first year guys!

11:18.440 --> 11:19.500
Isak?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.640
Hi! Eva!

11:23.920 --> 11:25.440
How's it going with you?

11:25.540 --> 11:30.380
It's going... better.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.920
Good.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.220
How's it going with your mom now?

11:34.500 --> 11:39.240
Good... It's a lot of stress.

11:42.140 --> 11:44.680
Her and dad will
surely find a solution.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.880
Good.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.140
So, it's going better with you now?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.200
Now it's going better.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.700
I have news for you.
-Yeah?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.380
Me and Jonas are back together.

12:12.740 --> 12:13.900
Seriously?

12:14.620 --> 12:19.620
He hasn't said anything, but... great!

12:20.420 --> 12:21.380
Yeah, I know.

12:24.180 --> 12:29.400
He has forgiven you and everything?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.260
Yes!

12:32.720 --> 12:33.700
Great!

12:38.060 --> 12:41.460
So I just want to say..
Thanks so much for being there for me.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.360
I don't know what I would've done without you.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.100
I don't have many people I can trust.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.420
But you're one of them. So, thanks.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.980
I'm just glad you guys worked it out.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.040
Yeah. I'm happy you support us.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.440
Team Jonas!

13:03.940 --> 13:07.740
There's just one thing I'm wondering.

13:08.080 --> 13:08.880
Hm?

13:11.420 --> 13:16.020
Did you also support us when
you told everyone that me and Chris hooked up?

13:16.520 --> 13:20.920
Because our relationship
went to hell after that!

13:21.660 --> 13:28.220
My whole life went to hell after that!
So you have to tell me what you were thinking.

13:28.220 --> 13:32.320
Because I think it's psycho.
Why did you do it?!

13:32.880 --> 13:34.320
What were you thinking?

13:38.240 --> 13:39.940
You really don't know why?

13:40.580 --> 13:42.340
No, I really don't know why!

13:43.280 --> 13:44.360
Think about it.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.600
What? Do you have...

14:02.340 --> 14:03.880
Do you have...

14:06.300 --> 14:08.120
... feelings for me?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.800
Like you didn't know?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.420
No...

14:17.580 --> 14:19.680
I didn't know.

14:25.700 --> 14:30.580
So it's not that great for
me to have to listen to you...

14:31.060 --> 14:34.740
... talk about Jonas,
and me having to be your advisor.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.560
That's really not great for me.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.840
Sitting there like an idiot.

14:40.220 --> 14:43.360
And hoping that one day you'll know...

14:46.320 --> 14:47.880
... that he's not good enough for you.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.980
Isak, I didn't know.

14:58.140 --> 15:02.720
Honestly, Eva. How did you not understand?

15:11.180 --> 15:14.460
Anyway, it's not an excuse for what you did.

15:14.700 --> 15:19.700
You outed me to the whole school!
-It was stupid. I fucked up.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.660
I was drunk and...

15:24.920 --> 15:30.180
I was also quite mad at you.

15:30.180 --> 15:33.800
I thought you used me.

15:36.460 --> 15:42.840
I didn't know Chris had a
psycho girlfriend who would create a bunch of drama.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.080
Then I wouldn't have done it.

15:45.260 --> 15:47.120
Eva, come.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.780
Now!

15:49.400 --> 15:50.260
Eva.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.600
Don't...

15:53.600 --> 15:56.480
You can't tell Jonas anything about this, okay?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.660
Call an ambulance!

16:04.980 --> 16:05.800
Vilde!

16:07.120 --> 16:08.420
What happened?!

16:08.440 --> 16:12.460
She came in, started staggering,
and then she tripped. She's not responding.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.560
Is your mom home?
-No, no!

19:30.420 --> 19:33.220
I think I killed William's baby tonight.
