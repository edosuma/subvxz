WEBVTT

01:22.164 --> 01:23.708
Here it is, gentlemen.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.587
Enough kaboom to turn Gotham
into the world's biggest pothole.

01:27.878 --> 01:30.756
What say we start the bidding
at one million?

01:31.799 --> 01:33.676
- One million.
- Two million.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.636
- Three million.
- Five.

01:37.346 --> 01:41.851
Gentlemen, please. Don't insult me
with nickel-and-dime bids.

01:42.643 --> 01:46.105
The man who walks outwith this bomb
walks outwith Gotham in his pocket.

01:46.522 --> 01:48.899
Yours to pick clean or blow sky-high.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.485
Your call. What am I bid?

01:51.902 --> 01:54.196
How about nothing?

01:54.989 --> 01:58.159
Zero, zip, zilch, nada.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.163
My personal check for bupkis.

02:02.246 --> 02:05.750
Drawn on
the First National Bank of Squadoo.

02:11.255 --> 02:12.715
Sorry, boys,

02:12.882 --> 02:14.508
this lot is sold.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.149
Whoops.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.573
You really should loosen up, dear.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.575
Have a laugh now and then.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.003
That's so much more pleasant.

02:51.587 --> 02:54.715
<i>Alerting the public now
would only cause a panic, Commissioner.</i>

02:54.799 --> 02:58.594
But if that madman plans to use
the bomb, we've got to clear the city.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.889
<i>I can't evacuate 10 million
people on your suspicions.</i>

03:02.473 --> 03:04.600
We don't even know if the bomb's
still in Gotham.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.811
Keep me posted if you find anything.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.356
The Joker will be
extra cautious this time.

03:10.606 --> 03:11.774
We'll have to think like him.

03:11.982 --> 03:14.110
Or recruit someone who does.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.832
Ms. Quinn.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.051
Don't you knock before entering
a lady's boudoir?

03:39.677 --> 03:42.638
- I need help.
- Well, you've come to the right place.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.390
I recommend a Iobotomy.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.143
The Joker's stolen a bomb.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.270
If I can't get to him in time

03:49.437 --> 03:52.481
this city and everyone in it
is going up in a mushroom cloud.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.194
So you want me to
turn squealer on Mr. J. Ha!

03:58.237 --> 04:00.531
Sorry, B-man, no deal.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.284
I've talked to Gordon
and Dr. Bartholomew.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.787
You help me find the Joker, and they'll
write your ticket out of here.

04:06.954 --> 04:08.122
Whee!

04:08.205 --> 04:10.624
If you promise no double-cross.

04:12.042 --> 04:14.628
Ah, shoot, take all the fun out of life.

04:15.212 --> 04:16.839
I don't have time for jokes.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.800
Okay, okay, I promise.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.010
Shake?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.308
Oh, the irony of it.

04:27.391 --> 04:31.687
The grim, stalwart Dark Knight
and his greatest female adversary

04:31.771 --> 04:33.898
fighting together to save the city.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.448
I sense a lack of trust.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.911
<i>Sure you don't need any help
keeping Zippy under control?</i>

04:47.161 --> 04:48.245
I'm fine.

04:48.537 --> 04:51.582
Besides, I need you to be ready
if Gordon's men get any leads.

04:51.832 --> 04:53.876
- I'II signal if there's trouble.
<i>- You</i> got it.

04:54.418 --> 04:56.754
- I wanna listen to the radio.
- Don't!

05:10.226 --> 05:11.268
Oops.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.354
Listen, and listen good.

05:13.854 --> 05:16.774
You don't touch anything, say anything

05:16.857 --> 05:18.901
or do anything unless I tell you!

05:19.151 --> 05:21.278
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

05:24.573 --> 05:27.326
So far, Joker hasn't been seen
at any of his old hideouts.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.663
I want you to show me the last place
he used when he escaped.

05:32.414 --> 05:33.582
Okay.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.299
This used to be our special love nest.

05:45.886 --> 05:49.098
Have a look around while I slip into
something more comfortable.

05:49.723 --> 05:50.808
No tricks.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.227
Hey, we have a deal, remember?

06:26.051 --> 06:27.219
Whee!

06:28.262 --> 06:31.682
Ah! I feel like a human being again.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.145
Hi, babies! Mommy's home!

06:39.690 --> 06:42.192
Are you the sweetest babies?

06:42.276 --> 06:45.070
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.575
<i>How do you â€œhe our ha-hacienda?</i>

06:49.992 --> 06:51.118
Charming.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.329
Especially these monitors.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.915
Between the cops,
city hall and the mayor's office,

06:55.998 --> 06:57.583
Joker has the whole city wired.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.251
He's a genius.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.128
What's the attraction, Quinn?

07:01.879 --> 07:03.797
This sick infatuation with the Joker.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.050
Look, Bats, when I was a doctor

07:06.133 --> 07:08.886
I was always listening
to other people's problems.

07:09.762 --> 07:15.142
Then I met Mr. J., who listened to me
for a change and made everything fun.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.313
You think it's funny
when he hurts people?

07:19.980 --> 07:21.190
It's just a joke.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.442
Hope you're still laughing
when it's your turn.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.110
Hmph.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.531
Meet us at
the Apex novelty factory.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.077
Quinn says it's an old hideout.
But the Joker may be using it again.

07:33.243 --> 07:34.370
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

07:45.089 --> 07:48.217
- Grab on.
- I can do it myself, thank you.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.595
Ha-ha! Ow!

08:08.654 --> 08:10.155
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.949
- Shh.
- Shh.

08:12.157 --> 08:15.703
What do you mean, "Shh"?
No one's been in this dump for years.

08:37.224 --> 08:38.350
Uh-oh.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.859
Hey, guys, look who I got.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.446
Well, well.

08:50.946 --> 08:52.072
If it ain't the big, bad Batman

08:52.156 --> 08:54.241
come to break up
Boxy Bennett's little social club.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.703
It's gonna cost you, freak, big time.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.831
Hi, Boxy. Long time no see.

09:02.082 --> 09:03.292
Harley Quinn.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.420
Last I heard, they tossed you in
the squirrel farm and swallowed the key.

09:07.504 --> 09:08.547
What you doing with the Bat?

09:11.008 --> 09:14.636
Come on, you don't think
I was working with Batman?

09:14.887 --> 09:18.682
I know you'd blow us both away
if you thought that.

09:19.391 --> 09:20.517
You thought right, sugar.

09:23.812 --> 09:24.855
Phew.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.399
So, you ain't seen Mr. J. around,
have you?

09:27.483 --> 09:28.525
Nope.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.861
You know, I never could figure
what a cute "file number like yourself

09:30.944 --> 09:32.613
saw in a slob like the Joker.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.033
Especially when there are suave guys
like me around.

09:36.825 --> 09:37.993
Now, Boxy.

09:38.577 --> 09:41.163
Sure, my pudding's
a little temperamental.

09:43.248 --> 09:46.752
But, gee, what relationship
doesn't have its ups and downs?

09:55.219 --> 09:56.261
A flat.

10:00.599 --> 10:05.187
<i>I never knew
That our romance had ended</i>

10:05.813 --> 10:09.149
<i>Until you poisoned my food</i>

10:10.150 --> 10:12.611
<i>And I thought it was a lark</i>

10:13.070 --> 10:15.781
<i>When you kicked me in the park</i>

10:16.615 --> 10:20.160
<i>But now I think it was rude</i>

10:22.204 --> 10:26.500
<i>I never knew that
you and I were finished</i>

10:27.334 --> 10:30.212
<i>Until that bottle hit my head</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:34.424
<i>Though I tried to be aloof</i>

10:34.675 --> 10:36.969
<i>When you pushed me off the roof</i>

10:38.262 --> 10:41.348
<i>I feel our romance is dead</i>

10:43.308 --> 10:47.813
<i>It wouldn't have been so bad
If you had told me</i>

10:48.313 --> 10:52.151
<i>That someone had taken my place</i>

10:53.735 --> 10:58.407
<i>But no
No, you didn't even scold me</i>

10:58.824 --> 11:03.579
<i>You just tried to disfigure my face</i>

11:05.330 --> 11:10.252
<i>You'll never know
How this heart of mine is breaking</i>

11:10.669 --> 11:14.006
<i>It looks so hopeless, but then</i>

11:15.340 --> 11:18.260
<i>Life used to be so placid</i>

11:18.343 --> 11:21.388
<i>Won't you please put down that acid?</i>

11:21.471 --> 11:27.561
<i>And say that we're sweethearts again</i>

11:32.566 --> 11:34.818
- Yeah.
- All right, baby!

11:40.032 --> 11:42.618
Whoo! All right, B and R!

11:50.459 --> 11:51.793
Hey, ugly.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.464
They're all working together.

12:10.145 --> 12:11.813
Let's go, Quinn!

12:12.147 --> 12:13.315
Quinn!

12:13.398 --> 12:14.691
Whee!

12:14.775 --> 12:16.485
Bombs away!

12:17.277 --> 12:18.654
Huh?

12:20.447 --> 12:21.531
Yes!

12:26.411 --> 12:28.330
Did you see the way
I handled those creeps?

12:28.455 --> 12:29.706
Pow! Bam!

12:29.790 --> 12:32.084
Oh, Batgirl, eat your heart out.

12:32.834 --> 12:35.504
What was she before she went bonkers?

12:35.879 --> 12:37.381
A clinical psychiatrist.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.592
Figures.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.517
- Any word on the Joker?
- Nothing.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.979
I even checked with Gordon again,
and the mayor still refuses

12:52.062 --> 12:53.772
to let the cops evacuate the city.

12:57.901 --> 12:59.069
Oh, it's brilliant.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.406
Way to go, Mr. J.!

13:02.781 --> 13:03.865
What are you saying?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.201
Oh, come on, Bats.

13:06.868 --> 13:09.871
You've seen how my pudding
keeps an eye on Gotham.

13:10.205 --> 13:12.082
<i>What better way to
tie up the cops</i>

13:12.165 --> 13:14.084
<i>than to tie up the mayor?</i>

13:19.715 --> 13:20.924
Whoo-hoo!

13:36.732 --> 13:39.901
See, do I know how
Mr. J. thinks, or what? Ha!

13:40.944 --> 13:44.656
And here you thought I was just another
bubble-headed blond bimbo.

13:44.740 --> 13:48.035
Well, the joke's on you.
I'm not even a real blond.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.122
Good job.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.958
Huh? Hey!

13:58.587 --> 14:01.840
- What gives?
- I can't risk you warning the Joker.

14:02.799 --> 14:05.010
Would I do a thing like that?

14:05.844 --> 14:07.846
Hey, let me out! Come on!

14:10.515 --> 14:13.226
Boy, you just can't trust some people.

14:21.568 --> 14:25.697
Nothing like a moonlight dip,
eh, Mr. Mayor?

14:26.031 --> 14:29.076
Please, just make your ransom demands
and get on with it.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.789
Oh, no ransom this time, Hammy.

14:34.081 --> 14:37.000
- You can't mean-
- Oh, yes, indeedy-do.

14:37.125 --> 14:41.797
Instead of taking you, the cops
and the Batman down separately,

14:41.880 --> 14:44.216
I'm going to blast you all at once.

14:45.842 --> 14:47.928
Send down the plane, boys.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.971
We're blowing town.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.306
Literally.

14:51.723 --> 14:52.974
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:53.767 --> 14:55.727
But all those innocent people.

14:56.019 --> 15:01.483
Some joke on them, eh?
Think of it as the ultimate punch line.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.277
What? Hey!

15:49.573 --> 15:53.285
Gee, it's amazing what you find
in people's glove compartments.

15:54.369 --> 15:55.495
Harley?

15:55.745 --> 15:58.331
Hi, pudding. Miss me?

16:00.417 --> 16:03.044
You clever little minx.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.297
How did you escape from Arkham?

16:05.672 --> 16:08.091
Batman sprung me so I could find you.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.845
Had me all locked up
in his bad old car, too.

16:12.387 --> 16:13.472
Aww.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.308
Quinn, we had a deal!

16:16.558 --> 16:20.854
Deal's off, B-man. No one ever said
anything about hurting Mr. J.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.037
Oh!

16:40.790 --> 16:43.418
<i>10-minute countdown
sequence has been engaged.</i>

16:43.502 --> 16:44.753
Oh, my Lord.

16:45.378 --> 16:46.588
Come, my dear.

16:46.671 --> 16:50.759
We'll get to a safe altitude,
then watch the fireworks.

16:50.842 --> 16:52.761
It's lucky you were here, Harley.

16:52.969 --> 16:55.639
The countdown sequence
didn't leave Joker enough time

16:55.722 --> 16:57.682
to swing by Arkham and pick you up.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.476
Quiet, brat.

16:59.726 --> 17:02.437
You were gonna come back for me,
weren't you, pudding?

17:02.646 --> 17:04.940
Of course, pumpkin pie.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.859
It's just that... Well, here you are,

17:07.943 --> 17:10.529
so I can save myself a trip.

17:10.987 --> 17:12.447
But what about all our friends?

17:12.531 --> 17:17.536
Ivy and Two-Face and hat guy
and lizard man and puppet head and-

17:17.994 --> 17:19.120
What about them?

17:19.412 --> 17:20.956
Don't forget your little pets.

17:21.998 --> 17:25.460
The babies!
We can't leave the babies!

17:25.835 --> 17:27.796
I'll buy you a goldfish!

17:27.879 --> 17:30.173
- Let's go!
- No!

17:30.423 --> 17:31.716
Why, you little-

17:56.866 --> 17:58.868
You know, Bats, I got a crazy idea

17:58.952 --> 18:02.122
Mr. J. may not be the guy
for me after all.

18:43.121 --> 18:46.166
- Go around again!
- But, boss...

18:49.085 --> 18:51.796
- I said do it!
- Yes, sir.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.352
Made it with time to spare.

19:34.881 --> 19:38.093
That bomb's going off
even if I go with it!

19:48.061 --> 19:50.563
Laugh this off, pudding!

20:10.333 --> 20:11.376
Whoa!

20:49.581 --> 20:52.959
- Freeze, clown.
- Quinn, stop!

20:53.543 --> 20:55.086
He's mine, Bats.

20:59.632 --> 21:01.551
You wouldn't dare.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.180
You don't have the guts.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.476
Not in a million years would you-

21:29.537 --> 21:32.373
Baby, you're the greatest.
