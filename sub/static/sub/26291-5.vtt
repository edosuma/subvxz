00:06.093 --> 00:08.095
MAN:
Let's go. Move.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.271
I said move!

00:10.314 --> 00:11.968
Uh, hey, watch the jacket, man.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.926
That jacket's the least
of your concern.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.363
All right.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.540
I mean, despite our
philosophical differences, man,

00:18.583 --> 00:20.455
ain't no reason we can't come to
some kind of arrangement here.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.375
Point taken.Open it.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.986
Soon as I open this up,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.989
I think we all gonna
feel a whole lot better.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.602
Fact is, plenty enough
in here for everybody.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.566
Okay, all right,
this is unexpected.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.568

I mean, maybe something
a little more upbeat.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.623
Why are you here?

01:41.666 --> 01:43.668
Don't you get tired of this?

01:43.712 --> 01:46.715
Same memory, same moment,
over and over?

01:49.239 --> 01:51.720
Gives me comfort.

You really should get that.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.169
Yeah, Christopher?

02:49.212 --> 02:52.955
LASALLE: I woke you up
this morning, didn't I?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.217
Yeah. What do we got?

02:54.261 --> 02:55.958
Four dead men, all members

02:56.001 --> 02:59.614
of a white nationalist group
called True Guard.

03:02.747 --> 03:06.751
True Guard deals meth.
Some kind of a drug dispute?

03:06.795 --> 03:08.057
Well, if there was,

03:08.100 --> 03:11.191
the killers were
better-trained than usual.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.150
Expert marksmen using
high-powered rifles,

03:14.194 --> 03:16.805
firing from two directions.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.546
Morning, Loretta.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.809
What can you tell me
about the victims?

03:20.852 --> 03:22.854
All killed instantly.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.379
Center-mass shots with
high-caliber rounds.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.686
Yeah, they got wiped out
before even getting a round off.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.644
Yeah, maybe not all of them.

03:29.687 --> 03:30.862
You find something, Sebastian?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.299
I found some footprints

03:32.342 --> 03:35.171
leading away from this container
to a clearing over here.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.520
Whoever it was,
they didn't get away unscathed.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.782
I found traces of blood.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.001
I'll run those through CODIS.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.569
So we got four dead
white nationalists,

03:41.612 --> 03:43.266
out in the middle of nowhere.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.703
Why did the sheriff call NCIS?

03:45.747 --> 03:47.227
They didn't. I did.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.405
You'll want to look inside,
Dwayne.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.627
This, uh, used to be
an old boatyard.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.239
Ran out of business
a few years ago.

03:59.282 --> 04:02.764
Looks like someone used
this container for storage.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.287
Storage for what?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.637
Bunch of kids toys?

04:06.681 --> 04:08.030
Not just any kid.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.786
These are mine.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.484
Any idea how
they got here?

04:27.528 --> 04:29.878
Yeah.

04:31.096 --> 04:35.318
Got one idea in particular.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.668
Cassius Pride.
New Orleans legend,

04:37.712 --> 04:40.149
fixer to politicians
and gangsters alike,

04:40.192 --> 04:41.846
had his finger in every
corrupt pie in the city.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.805
Guess that apple fell
far from that tree, huh?

04:43.848 --> 04:45.546
Whole other orchard.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.418
Cassius finally got pinched
over a bribery scheme.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.681
Half the judges in the state
were on his payroll.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.466
Served 20 years in prison.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.163
He got out a few months ago.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.426
Yeah, because Pride wrote a
letter to the parole board, huh?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.646
Guess they're close?Yeah, close to killing
each other.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.561
It's complicated, yeah.Where is he now?

05:00.604 --> 05:01.953
Supposed to be
on parole in Lafayette.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.912
Lasalle has a call in
to check up on him.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.870
I'm tracking down
the owner of the boatyard.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.829
I'm trying to see who used
that container for storage.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.570
Great. We need to know
what was in there

05:09.613 --> 05:10.788
and whether it was
worth killing over.

05:15.576 --> 05:18.143
Sebastian got a hit
on the unknown blood

05:18.187 --> 05:19.144
from the crime scene.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.972
Meet James Edwin Boyd.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.671
Last known whereabouts:
Raleigh, North Carolina.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.282
He's got a record going
all the way back to his teens.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.371
Fraud, theft, forgery.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.286
It's felonies
but nothing violent.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.680
Until today. No one walks away
from that slaughter

05:32.723 --> 05:33.985
unless they're involved, right?

05:34.029 --> 05:35.770
Depends.
What's the evidence say?

05:35.813 --> 05:39.164
Whole lot of nothing.
Got, uh, cardboard boxes,

05:39.208 --> 05:42.298
furniture fibers,
tire residue off of an old car.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.823
Nothing valuable like drugs
or weapons or hidden treasure.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.391
Thanks. No one's going to
be surprised to hear:

05:48.435 --> 05:51.307
Cassius hasn't reported
to his parole officer this week.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.874
North Carolina
state troopers

05:52.917 --> 05:55.833
found his abandoned car outside
of Raleigh a few days ago.

05:55.877 --> 05:59.184
James Boyd's last known address
was also in Raleigh.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.577
Can't be a coincidence.

06:00.621 --> 06:01.883
Well, we know where they were.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.188
So where are they now?

06:23.513 --> 06:25.515
Dwayne.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.347
Enough with the book.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.132
There's an envelope
in that glove box.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.656
How about you get that for me?

06:38.049 --> 06:39.050
Careful.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.532
Put all that back up in there.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.316
And don't mess
with that gun.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.405
It's not a toy.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.539

Sorry, I, uh...

07:36.760 --> 07:38.283
You okay?

07:43.985 --> 07:45.073
What you got?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.640
Well, last week, Raleigh PD ran

07:46.683 --> 07:49.294
surveillance on a local
after-hours joint,

07:49.338 --> 07:52.776
snapped photos of these two.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.039
PRIDE:
Guess I'm not surprised.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.390
May have an address here
in New Orleans for James Boyd.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.870
His mom passed away
a few years ago,

07:59.914 --> 08:00.871
left him a house in Tremé.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.177
Team's on the way.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.832
Thank you, Christopher.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.054
Pretty sure D.C. wouldn't
approve of me bringing

08:10.098 --> 08:12.013
the regional SAC
onto a tactical op.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.971
Can't disagree.As long as we're clear

08:14.015 --> 08:15.059
on how we're pissing
them off this week.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.800
Mm-hmm.GREGORIO:
Movement inside.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.062
At least two, maybe more.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.890

Copy that.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.589
Hiya, kid.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.289
Hell of a reunion.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.955
I do believe this
is the first time

10:07.998 --> 10:09.696
a coroner's given
me first aid.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.524
Thank your son I'm working on
you here and not at the morgue.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.484
It's been a minute, Loretta.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.052
You're charming as ever. Ow!

10:18.095 --> 10:21.577
Cassius. Dwayne suffered enough
because of you.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.710
The last thing he needs
is any more problems.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.276
I know.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.669
He nearly died.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.846
He did die. He's just stubborn.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.500
Didn't stick.Listen,

10:31.543 --> 10:32.980
you got to look at it
from my perspective.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.546
To learn that your son
was nearly killed

10:34.590 --> 10:36.592
on the nightly news?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.987
Well, I'd hope it would make you
question your parenting skills.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.293
No, I reached out.
I called a dozen times.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.991
I never heard a word back.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.383
What, you're looking
for sympathy?

10:45.427 --> 10:47.298
No, I'm looking
for clarification.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.561
Cutting me off was his choice,
not mine.

10:49.605 --> 10:53.391
And I know I've made
my share of mistakes,

10:53.435 --> 10:56.177
but I-I paid my debt.
I did my time.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.396
And he got you out years early

10:58.440 --> 11:02.618
just for you to land right back
in the thick of trouble.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.490
Hey, I am the victim here.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.711
I was grabbed off the
street by those thugs.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.234
And I-I would explain
that to Dwayne

11:10.278 --> 11:11.801
if he would just
talk to me.

11:11.845 --> 11:16.023
Well, he is busy trying to fix
whatever mess you got into.

11:16.066 --> 11:19.417
Now, you just sit still,
'cause this is gonna hurt.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.728
You hit like a girl.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.644
That's what you get for trying
to stab a federal agent.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.472
It's called self-defense.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.735
It's called
attempted murder.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.433
Add that to a
kidnapping charge.Kidnapping?

11:35.477 --> 11:38.132
No way. We were holding Cassius

11:38.175 --> 11:39.699
'cause he's
a double-crossing snake.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.309
No argument there.

11:41.352 --> 11:44.051
All we wanted is what's owed.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.314
Protection money.

11:46.357 --> 11:49.926
Your guard was protecting
Cassius in prison?

11:49.970 --> 11:55.323
For 20 years, he could sleep
like a baby on our hard work.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.629
Soon as he gets out,
he skips town.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.762
Now he's back with
his new partner.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.285
You mean James Boyd?

12:02.809 --> 12:06.769
They thought they could get
the money on their own.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.337
Cut us out.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.165
The money was supposed
to be in the container.

12:11.208 --> 12:15.212
Cassius wouldn't say,
but Jimmy gave it up.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.389
Took my boys there.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.959
Slaughtered them like animals.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.962
And I'm the one in chains.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.051
How much money we talking?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.619
$3 million.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.971
Yeah, greatest heist
in New Orleans history,

12:35.015 --> 12:37.887
and you have no clue.

12:39.715 --> 12:44.154
You're talking about the...
River Grand Casino?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.591
Yeah.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.725
Yeah, Cassius Pride
planned the whole thing.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.947
HANNAH:
What's the River Grand heist?

12:53.990 --> 12:59.126
20 years ago, two men broke
into the River Grand Casino,

12:59.169 --> 13:02.259
killed three employees,
walked with $3 million,

13:02.303 --> 13:04.174
disappeared into legend.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.481
No arrests

13:06.524 --> 13:08.135
Money was never recovered.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.963
Was your father involved?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.358
PRIDE:
Only one way to find out.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.062
Ah, the prodigal son.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.716
River Grand Casino.
What do you know?

13:24.760 --> 13:26.806
Only stories.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.199
Something to pass the time
during my incarceration.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.897
You're lying.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.507
How do you know?

13:32.550 --> 13:33.725
Your lips are moving.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.728
Listen, we need
to talk alone.

13:36.772 --> 13:37.947
No.

13:37.991 --> 13:41.385
Oh, I don't mind.I do. Stay.

13:42.604 --> 13:46.913
The thing you need
to understand about my career:

13:46.956 --> 13:49.872
I got to tell stories
in order to gain respect.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.657
You sent four men
to their deaths,

13:52.701 --> 13:54.355
and it wasn't
over nothing.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.444
I was in a bit of a bind.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.229
Literally.So you had your buddy Jimmy Boyd

13:59.273 --> 14:01.275
set an ambush.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
But I'm thinking
he double-crossed you,

14:03.103 --> 14:04.234
took the money.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.801
There is no money.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.890
And Jimmy's no killer.
He knew that that container

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
was just filled
with my old stuff.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.937
He was stalling.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.330
That container has
been empty for years.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.897
Well, what happened
to my things?

14:14.941 --> 14:16.029
That's what you're
gonna tell me.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.813
Because whoever
killed those men

14:17.857 --> 14:19.554
is probably still
looking for your things,

14:19.597 --> 14:21.904
and I don't want innocent
people to get hurt.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.210
It's not my fault.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.428
Nothing ever is.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.039
Oh, yeah.

14:26.082 --> 14:29.999
It always comes back to this,
doesn't it?

14:30.043 --> 14:32.567
Your mother was fragile.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.656
She was drifting away.
She was sick.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
You can't blame me
because she went nuts.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.791
Say another word, and I will
knock you on your ass!

14:39.835 --> 14:40.836
You understand me?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.708
Hey! Family time is over.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.845
Oh, he's probably
got broken ribs.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.848
He should get
to the hospital.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.677
Take Christopher.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.853
Keep an eye on him.
He's slippery.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.682
You nearly died.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.903
And you wouldn't even
let me talk to you.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.861
That was a wakeup call.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.471
That's why I came home.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.824
I know you think, uh,

15:12.868 --> 15:15.479
that I don't care
about you, but...

15:17.525 --> 15:20.702
I do.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.967
On second thought...

15:25.011 --> 15:27.274
I'll find Christopher myself.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.586
Christopher and Dr. Wade
are escorting Cassius

15:35.630 --> 15:36.979
to the hospital.

15:37.023 --> 15:37.893
Pride didn't go?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.678
He's taking some
cooldown time.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.463
Who can blame him?
This case is a mess,

15:42.506 --> 15:43.986
and it's probably
Cassius's responsibility.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.509
We're gonna sort it out.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.207
First things first-- Jimmy Boyd.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.035
If he ambushed those men,
he had help.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.688
We need to track him down.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.299
SEBASTIAN: Patton's going
through traffic cams

15:52.342 --> 15:54.518
and CCTVs around the city--
no sign of Jimmy yet.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.912
Whatever he was looking for was
not in that storage container.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.914
Yeah, all the contents got
sold off at public auction.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.263
We need to trace
who bought what.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.048
I had NOPD send the case file.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.745
Robbery went down a month

16:03.788 --> 16:05.181
before he was arrested
on bribery charges.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.922
Any suspects?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.489
A couple of people of interest,
nothing solid.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.144
Plus, the River Grand
wasn't exactly cooperative.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.276
Yeah, they were more interested
in keeping the robbery quiet

16:13.320 --> 16:14.364
than finding the money.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.018
So we reinvestigate the case.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.063
We put the pieces
together ourselves.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.629
We have one witness:

16:18.673 --> 16:19.935
Gina Powell.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.806
Casino floor manager
was wounded

16:21.850 --> 16:23.939
outside the count room
where the others were killed.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.027
All right,
we should talk to her.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.028
No need.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.551
Pride pulled the
case files, too.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.858
He's on his way to see
Gina Powell himself.

16:29.901 --> 16:30.902
I guess he knows her.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.079
So much for cooling off.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.866
Dwayne Pride.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.956
You know, one of us owes
the other a phone call.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.566
: But I
don't remember who.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.003
Ah, I'm sure
it's me, Gina.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.308
It's good
to see you thriving.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.790
They just keep throwing
fancier titles at me.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.184
Chief executive
of leisure activities.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.402
You keep the party going.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.143
And you're still fighting
the good fight.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.710
Don't know any other way,

16:55.753 --> 16:58.060
but this one's personal
for both of us.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.019
River Grand Casino heist.Mm.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.717
This is, uh, Todd Jamieson,
Risk Management.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.024
How are you?Asked him to join.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.765
Though I'm not sure why you're
interested in ancient history.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.115
Three dead,
three million stolen.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.552
I'm not sure why
you wouldn't be.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.293
I was there, Dwayne.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.556
I still have nightmares
about it, but...MAN: Ms. Powell.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.905
...life goes on.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.167
Excuse me.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.517
MAN:
Sign here, please.

17:21.910 --> 17:25.305
There has, uh,
been a development.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.698
Four more people
were killed,

17:27.742 --> 17:30.571
supposedly
over the missing money.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.094
Not gonna hit the news, is it?

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
Todd.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.274
Okay, now, you said this was
personal for both of us.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.668
I lost friends that
day; almost died.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.452
What's your stake?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.237
Cassius may be involved.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.109
Your dad was very good
to me and my father.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.980
Got this job
because of him.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.112
Because he delivered
hush money

17:50.156 --> 17:51.244
for the men who built
River Grand.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.462
:
Okay.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.160
Also ancient history.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.900
Our business is run
by a board of directors now,

17:55.944 --> 17:56.988
not gangsters.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.078
What are you
looking for, Dwayne?

17:59.121 --> 18:02.994
I want what River Grand
really knows about the robbery.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.387
Read the police report.I have.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.650
Management was tight-lipped;
no one was talking.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.262
I told those investigators
everything I possibly could.

18:09.305 --> 18:12.395
I know you did, Gina,
which is why I'm here now,

18:12.439 --> 18:14.049
friend to friend.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.444
I'm not looking
to dredge up the casino's past

18:17.487 --> 18:20.882
or embarrass anyone.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.449
I just want to right a wrong.

18:24.233 --> 18:27.062
Let me see what I can find.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.238
Thank you.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.157
Hey. Spoke to Lasalle
at the hospital.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
They're keeping Cassius
overnight for observation.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.682
His injuries that severe?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.206
Doctors won't talk
to anyone but the family,

18:40.249 --> 18:41.511
and Pride's not interested.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.644
PATTON: Jimmy Boyd
is back on the map.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.862
He's still in New Orleans.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.168
The gall, considering
the body count

18:46.212 --> 18:47.909
he's responsible for.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.171
I've been searching
these traffic cams

18:49.215 --> 18:51.086
all day
looking for an exit point,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.088
but he's not
trying to flee.Where is he, Patton?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.742
As of this afternoon,

18:54.785 --> 18:56.222
he's a block away from where
you found Cassius.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.440
The exact same time.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.138
He knows we have Cassius.
Got to assume

18:59.181 --> 19:00.356
he knows we're looking
for him, too.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.184
What's his angle?Tammy, call Lasalle.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.620
Tell him to keep
his eyes peeled.

19:03.664 --> 19:04.752
I'll loop Dwayne in.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.334
CASSIUS:
Baby, come on.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.988
Just take it.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.556
Take it. Come on.
I want to help.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.429
I don't need this kind
of help, Cassius.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.170
Well, what do you need, hmm?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.128
You.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.174
No.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.133
Baby, you got me.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.663
You seem surprised.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.233
You had to know Dad got around.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.152
Ah.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.721
You know... but he didn't.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.378
Not like that, Cassius.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.209
The boy needs a man.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.348
Time to wake up, Dwayne.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.045
He's waiting.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.180
Don't move.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.271
Or what?

20:29.315 --> 20:32.100
You gonna shoot
your own brother, Jimmy?

20:45.461 --> 20:48.856
Been imagining
this moment my whole life,

20:48.899 --> 20:51.641
actually meeting my half brother
face to face.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.035
Always pointing a gun at
me when you imagined it?

20:54.078 --> 20:57.517
No, that part's a little bit
of a surprise.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.562
Gonna need the
weapon, Jimmy.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.738
Yeah, of course.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.262
Sorry.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.525
I mean, guns aren't
really my style.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.440
Yeah, I can tell.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.180
Safety's on.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.835
Ah, yeah, I just didn't want you
shooting me before we chatted.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.925
You knew Cassius
had another family?

21:14.969 --> 21:16.710
Mom said we weren't really
allowed to talk about it,

21:16.753 --> 21:18.929
but yeah, yeah, I knew.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.149
Ah, she was
an amazing woman.

21:21.192 --> 21:24.761
Kept me out of trouble...
more or less.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.809
Only weak spot was Pop.
Couldn't say no.

21:28.852 --> 21:32.943
Yeah, Cassius has that way.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.728
Trouble always follows.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.251
Mm. Truth.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.341
Jimmy, I'm gonna need you
to put your hands

21:39.385 --> 21:40.560
on top of that cabinet.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.518
What, you gonna frisk me?

21:42.562 --> 21:45.347
You're a murder suspect
and a fugitive.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.001
Man, I been keeping clean.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.394
I'm the one
nearly got shot.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.960
'Cause I was trying
to help Pop.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.875
Those True Guard dudes
would have beat him to death

21:51.919 --> 21:53.486
if I hadn't taken 'em
to that container.

21:53.529 --> 21:56.271
So you had 'em all killed?Whoa.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.099
I may not be a Boy Scout
like you,

21:58.142 --> 21:59.666
but I never killed anyone.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.581
I have no clue

22:01.624 --> 22:03.322
who those shooters were.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.109
You got any beers?

22:08.152 --> 22:09.806
I figure we crack
a couple,

22:09.850 --> 22:11.373
hash this whole thing out.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.853
This isn't Miller time.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.856
Don't you have, like,
a million questions?

22:15.899 --> 22:17.118
Now, I know I do.
Yeah.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.728
Let's start with
the four dead men.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.122
Yeah, all right.
Gonna catch some killers.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.820
How can I help?

22:23.864 --> 22:25.692
Start by turning around again,

22:25.735 --> 22:27.346
putting your hands
behind your back.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.086
We don't need the bracelets,
though, do we?
Turn.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.958
Oh, come on, man.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.917
We family.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.311
I got your text.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.921
You found something?

22:37.965 --> 22:38.922
Uh, looks like you did.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.403
Well, technically,
I found him.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.144
Jimmy Boyd.
Dwayne's brother.

22:43.187 --> 22:44.928
What

22:44.972 --> 22:46.408
Half brother, actually.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.976
Another byproduct of Cassius'

22:49.019 --> 22:50.978
colorful personality.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.633
Uh, do you mind if I steal
a couple of those?

22:53.676 --> 22:56.026
I haven't eaten anything
all day.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.334
Pride, you sure you
don't want Sebastian

22:59.378 --> 23:02.119
to run a DNA test
or something?

23:02.163 --> 23:04.600
What I want is an update.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.776
Okay, River Grand sent over
security footage

23:06.820 --> 23:08.909
from the night
of the robbery.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.651
Hannah took it and the
original NOPD case file

23:11.694 --> 23:13.174
to the lab,
looking for a new lead.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.871
And I also got a hold

23:14.915 --> 23:16.525
of public auction records
from a few years ago.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.788
Tracking who bought
all of Cassius's old stuff.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.182
We're not the only one
to inquire; someone else called.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.445
Oh, that'd be Pop.Stay out of this, Jimmy.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.273
He's right, your father accessed
the same auction records,

23:25.316 --> 23:27.449
used the computer at the
hospital to check 'em out.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.059
Lasalle was watching him.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.931
They keep taking Cassius
for all these tests.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.802
Lasalle waits outside.

23:32.846 --> 23:37.154
No way he had three million cash
sitting in that container.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.896
Oh, no, he definitely did.
Brought it there myself.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.247
When, Jimmy?

23:43.291 --> 23:44.684
20 years ago.

23:44.727 --> 23:45.902
He needed help
settling his affairs

23:45.946 --> 23:47.164
before he went to prison.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.123
Where was it hidden?JIMMY: I have no idea.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.168
He's telling me
one way or the other.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.388
I'm heading
to that hospital.Yeah, bye.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.911
Don't bother. He's gone.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.870
Lasalle said he slipped
out during an MRI.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.306
All right, get a BOLO out.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.569
Every cop in the city needs
to be looking for him.

24:00.613 --> 24:01.744
JIMMY:
You could do that.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.181
Or you could cut the middle man.

24:06.532 --> 24:10.100
'Cause I know
exactly where he's going.

24:16.019 --> 24:19.196
JIMMY:
This club is the best-kept
secret in New Orleans.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.764
Never been raided.
Cops don't even know it exists.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.505
Every minute we waste
here is a minute

24:23.549 --> 24:24.811
that Cassius is
getting away.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.203
You got to trust me,
big brother.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.770
Please don't call me that.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.729
Here we go.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.169
Hey, what's up, man?

24:35.212 --> 24:37.345
Hey, my brother.
Hey, Jimmy.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.177
Cassius is trying to get
out of town with $3 million.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.961
Why would he come
to a club?

24:45.005 --> 24:47.529
'Cause this is Dario's spot.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
Best print man in the Southeast.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.228
I hooked 'em up.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.882
False documents, Jimmy?

24:52.926 --> 24:54.667
I thought you were clean.I am.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.060
Straight and narrow
for 15 months.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.453
Then Pops rolls into town.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.237
Thought by now you'd
know how to avoid him.

25:00.281 --> 25:03.066
What can I say? I got
a soft spot for the old man.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.285
Just like Mama.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.157
There's Dario.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.724
All right, now, let me
do the talking, okay?

25:08.768 --> 25:09.725
Try not to look so...

25:09.769 --> 25:11.031
federal.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.032
Dario.

25:12.075 --> 25:16.515
My man.
Looking tight.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.081
I don't want any
of what you got.
Look,

25:18.125 --> 25:19.735
I just want to
ask you a question

25:19.779 --> 25:21.563
about a client I sent
your way: Cassius Pride.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.130
You got me mixed up
with someone else.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.871
Working on a couple
passports for us.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.916
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friend.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.310
Your friend is a cop,
which makes you a snitch.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.747
Your best option is to
turn around and get out

25:31.791 --> 25:33.488
before I get security.Yeah, well,
here's another option.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.144
I call a team of federal agents,

25:37.187 --> 25:40.060
and they storm this place
and arrest everybody in here.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.844
Except for you, Dario.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.237
I'm gonna sit you right down
at the edge of that bar

25:43.280 --> 25:45.152
and make sure that
everyone in here

25:45.195 --> 25:47.241
gets a good look at the guy
who's turning 'em in.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.157
That is cold.All right, all right.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.115
I'm meeting Cassius
in a few hours.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.770
Where?Pump station on St. Claude.

25:54.814 --> 25:58.339
Canadian passport,
clean title for his car.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.645
Wait, hold on. Where's mine?

25:59.688 --> 26:01.603
He only asked for the one.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.650
This is for a
'72 El Dorado.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.216
I remember that car.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.653
Good to see you, chief.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.438
Just spoke to Pride.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.092
He might have a lead
on Cassius.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.572
What you got

26:13.615 --> 26:15.965
I got the witness statement
from Gina Powell.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.228
It says that
she and her boss

26:18.272 --> 26:20.100
were, uh, shot outside
the count room.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.971
Guards were killed inside,
and then she played dead

26:22.015 --> 26:23.625
until the gunmen got
away with the cash.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.279
Right, and then she used
her boss's tie

26:25.322 --> 26:27.150
to make a tourniquet;
it probably saved her life.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.456
Right, well, that's...
that's the interesting part.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.676
Here, take a look at this.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.199
The knot is on the outside.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.636
If she had done that herself,
it'd be facing in.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.724
She needed help.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.204
Yeah.
The only people in that room

26:37.247 --> 26:38.466
were robbers and dead men.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.163
Let's dig deeper
into Gina Powell.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.648
JIMMY: Yeah, Pop loved that El Dorado.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.085
PRIDE:
I spent half my childhood
riding around in it.

26:49.129 --> 26:52.349
You remember that nasty softener
he used to rub into the leather?

26:52.393 --> 26:54.177
Ah, I loved that smell.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.008
He taught me to drive
in that car.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.099
Didn't spend much time
together, but for a month,

27:03.143 --> 27:05.972
when I was 16,
he'd take me out.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.365
Not in town, of course.
Too many prying eyes.

27:10.237 --> 27:11.455
Barking orders at me.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.154
It was nice.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.289
Speak of the devil.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.033
We about to have
a serious conversation

27:24.077 --> 27:25.339
about one passport.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.211
Yeah, listen, just
let me do the talking.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.257
Until I get him in cuffs.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.216
Jimmy, stay down!

27:49.102 --> 27:50.625
What are you doing?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.628
I'm gonna try to get to Pop.
Cover me.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.983
Jimmy!

28:32.188 --> 28:33.668
Dwayne, are you okay?

28:33.712 --> 28:34.713
Had better days.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.279
Got BOLOs out on
the black SUVs

28:36.323 --> 28:37.498
and Cassius's car.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.152
We're gonna find
him and Jimmy.
Hope so.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.980
Just learned I have a brother.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.025
Like to keep him alive
long enough to get to know him.

28:43.069 --> 28:44.635
Sebastian's still
running forensics,

28:44.679 --> 28:46.333
but the ballistics
from the pump station

28:46.376 --> 28:48.378
match the rounds that killed
the True Guard members.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.990
Well, those gunmen were
well trained and well informed.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.861
They knew where Cassius
would be.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.950
I have no idea how.Actually,

28:54.994 --> 28:56.299
they were following you.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.214
And I think we know
who tipped them off.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.868
NOPD found two
persons of interest

28:59.912 --> 29:01.304
in the River Grand heist.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.393
A pair of low-level
stickup men.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.743
Never arrested for the heist,

29:04.786 --> 29:06.788
but they both ended up
in prison for other crimes.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.573
Commissary accounts
maxed out every month for years,

29:09.617 --> 29:11.227
thanks to Gina Powell.

29:13.621 --> 29:16.102
They both died violently inside,

29:16.145 --> 29:17.712
probably also thanks to her.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.107
Only reason Gina
would pay them off

29:21.150 --> 29:23.849
and then have them killed

29:23.892 --> 29:25.807
is if she was involved
in the robbery.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.635
Not just involved.
We think she planned it.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.115
She showed up on the day

29:29.158 --> 29:31.508
and took a bullet to
make it look legit.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.249
In 20 years,

29:33.293 --> 29:35.295
Gina Powell made no move

29:35.338 --> 29:38.037
to get that money
only to cover up a crime?

29:38.080 --> 29:41.431
Why?
Well, she's not
interested in the cash.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.607
She just doesn't want
to be exposed.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.261
HANNAH:
With good reason.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.742
The River Grand may have
a board of directors now,

29:47.786 --> 29:49.222
but they're still
heavily financed

29:49.265 --> 29:50.701
by organized crime.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.313
They find out what she
did, and she's dead.

29:53.356 --> 29:56.055
And Cassius is the only person
still alive

29:56.098 --> 29:58.144
who can tie her to that robbery.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.276
She had her men take
Jimmy as leverage.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.149
Cassius doesn't care
about anybody except Cassius.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.933
He'll go off the grid

30:04.977 --> 30:07.762
unless we find him first.

30:12.506 --> 30:13.942
Hello?

30:13.986 --> 30:16.075
PRIDE : Gonna need you
to pull over, Cassius.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.467
Dwayne.

30:17.511 --> 30:19.513
Well, you were never one
to disappoint.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.341
How'd you get this number?

30:21.384 --> 30:22.646
Perk of my new job.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.648
All sorts of access
to federal agencies

30:24.692 --> 30:26.172
with high-tech equipment.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.087
Believe it or not,
I was gonna call you.

30:28.130 --> 30:31.481
I'm on my way to fix things
right now.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.266
Like you fixed
my Little League career?

30:33.309 --> 30:36.443
Hey, you were
a natural-born shortstop.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.140
The coach just didn't see it.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.664
So you planted a brick
of hash in his truck

30:40.708 --> 30:42.449
and had him arrested.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.972
:
Well, it worked, didn't it?

30:44.016 --> 30:45.539
And don't you worry.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.367
I'm gonna handle
the Jimmy situation right now.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.282
Oh, I know you will.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.814
How'd you get here so fast?
I've been driving all day.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.600
FBI loaned me a plane.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.646
Where's the money?

31:05.689 --> 31:08.388
That is the cosmic joke

31:08.431 --> 31:10.172
of all time.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.479
I don't have it.
I never did.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.002
So you went to
all this trouble

31:14.046 --> 31:18.006
coming back to New Orleans,
nearly getting killed,

31:18.050 --> 31:20.182
just to get the
old Caddy back?

31:20.226 --> 31:22.532
Well, I love this car, son.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.885
You, uh...

31:26.928 --> 31:28.974
Do you remember
The French Connection?

31:29.017 --> 31:30.714
Of course.
I took you to that movie.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.412
You left me at that movie.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.805
All day.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.851
While you were out
collecting bribes.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.852
Is there a point?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.419
The scene where the cops

31:39.462 --> 31:41.943
pulled the car apart
looking for the drugs?

31:41.987 --> 31:44.380
I won't have to work as hard.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.478
I know this looks bad.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.741
I wasn't involved
in the robbery.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.526
I was just involved
in the clean-up.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.136
And people were not
supposed to die.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.138
They never are.

32:03.182 --> 32:06.359
So, what? Gina asked you
to get rid of the money?

32:06.402 --> 32:08.970
Yep.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.495
But waste not, want not.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.541
You gonna arrest me now?

32:14.584 --> 32:19.111
No. I'm gonna keep you
to your word for once.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.764
You're gonna fix this mess.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.593

33:05.984 --> 33:07.463
Your name wasn't on it.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.508
Friend of the band.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.684
Nathaniel and I go back.

33:10.727 --> 33:11.902
What can I do for you?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.643
You can give me Jimmy Boyd.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.038
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:17.082 --> 33:21.042
And in return, I'll give
you the three million...

33:24.089 --> 33:25.481
...that you stole
from River Grand.

33:25.525 --> 33:26.613
What the hell, Dwayne?

33:26.656 --> 33:27.527
What?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.442
They don't know?

33:29.485 --> 33:32.053
That you set up your own casino
to get robbed?

33:32.097 --> 33:34.012
Okay, I... you have lost me now.

33:34.055 --> 33:38.016
Did I? Your guy seems
to get where I'm coming from.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.147
Everything all right?

33:39.191 --> 33:41.584
We got evidence.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.631
Maybe not enough
to prove in court,

33:44.674 --> 33:46.589
but plenty to convince
your bosses.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.158
What do you want?

33:50.202 --> 33:53.640
No cops, no strings. Just us.

33:53.683 --> 33:57.209
You get your money, I get Jimmy.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.994
Money's worthless
without Cassius.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.779
You got him, we can deal.

34:02.823 --> 34:05.086
So let's deal.

34:05.130 --> 34:08.046
I make a call, Cassius
is outside in 30 seconds.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.830
I need your weapon.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.658

34:39.338 --> 34:42.123
I wish it hadn't gone down

34:42.167 --> 34:44.560
If only your father
would've done

34:44.604 --> 34:46.606
what he was supposed to do--
burn the money.

34:46.649 --> 34:49.739
And die in prison, like the men
who robbed the casino for you?

34:49.783 --> 34:52.568
I was a different person.
I was totally strung out.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.702
I don't give a crap,
Gina. I want Jimmy,

34:55.745 --> 34:57.443
and I want him now.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.622
You all right?JIMMY:
Yep.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.841
Though, in retrospect,

35:04.885 --> 35:06.843
should've stuck with you
at the last shootout.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.368
Cassius?

35:14.895 --> 35:16.505
:
This is Cassius.

35:17.593 --> 35:20.553
Come on in. I got Jimmy.

35:20.596 --> 35:21.684
CASSIUS:
Pulling in now.

35:32.608 --> 35:36.177
Now, Gina, we can work this out.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.744
You let my boys go, we'll talk.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.268
Unfortunately,
it's not up to her.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.841
Management has zero tolerance
for betrayal.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.799
Do it now.

35:52.193 --> 35:54.761
Pop! Pop!

36:13.214 --> 36:14.215
Check the Caddy.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.782
Make sure
Cassius Pride is dead.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.132
What
What, you'll shoot us?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.525
Smarter than he looks.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.266
PRIDE: Take it
easy, Jimmy.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.616
30 seconds, my entire team
will be up here,

36:23.659 --> 36:25.139
and he will be in cuffs.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.227
Really?

36:26.271 --> 36:27.620
MAN: We got a
problem here.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.535
There's nobody in this car.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.539
Tell me where he is.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.628
If I tell you, I'm dead.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.370
Jimmy, no!

36:40.067 --> 36:41.373
Move in.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.768
NCIS!

36:52.688 --> 36:54.429
Drop your weapon! Get down!

37:04.004 --> 37:06.572
GREGORIO:
Trying to get a clear shot.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.574
Put it down now.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.843
Jimmy.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.585
Jimmy, you saved my life.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.284
But you need to lower
that weapon now.

37:23.328 --> 37:27.549
Right. 'Cause, uh, I'm pretty
sure I left the safety on again.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.910
CASSIUS: I always knew
we'd get out of this mess.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.782
We make a good team.

37:42.825 --> 37:46.438
Think we got a different
definition of "team" and "we."

37:46.481 --> 37:47.961
You were almost to Mexico.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.311
Well, there's plenty of blame
to throw around.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.532
You see how I'm not mentioning
what Dwayne did to my car?

37:53.575 --> 37:55.360
No, you didn't.Oh, all right, okay, all right.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.710
Maybe you ought to just quit
while you're ahead, Cassius.

37:57.753 --> 38:00.539
Seeing my two boys together
just warms my heart.

38:02.149 --> 38:04.717
Could've happened a lot sooner
if you'd been honest.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.675
We all have regrets
in our lives.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.678
I guess that I've got
more than my share.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.941
I regret ever letting you
through my front door.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.469
Well, you're on
your own now, kid.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.774
Seems like I have
enough information

38:18.818 --> 38:20.776
on True Guard's meth operation

38:20.820 --> 38:23.344
to land me a very nice spot
in WitSec.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.389
Unbelievable.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.915
Now, I know that I...

38:28.958 --> 38:32.092
I'm not the father
that you two boys deserve,

38:32.135 --> 38:36.357
but I want you to know
I love you.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.881
I always will.

38:38.925 --> 38:42.363
And that's God's truth.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.366
Come on.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.934
I'll buy you that beer.
You earned it.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.983
JIMMY:
Man, I can't believe

38:54.027 --> 38:55.420
you bought the Trutone.Mm-hmm.

38:55.463 --> 38:56.899
Must be a money pit.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.901
Yeah, well, it has its appeal.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.687
And memories.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.906
D-Man. Missed most of the show
the other night.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.255
Yeah, I got a little occupied.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.388
But thank you for
the VIP pass.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.389
It helped me out big-time.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.435
Anything. I owe you, friend.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.219
But, life lesson:

39:12.262 --> 39:14.700
never accept a borrowed car
from a bass player in Shongaloo.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.094
You're just lucky that I was

39:18.138 --> 39:19.792
sitting in
on keyboards that night.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.228
That's my cue.
But, uh, you're welcome

39:21.271 --> 39:23.012
to sit in again.
Mark won't mind.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.493
Ah, no, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
