president of a network..."

Don't start any sentence with:
"As a female..."

"that show business
is still business.

When I was at
Harvard Business School,"

03:36.241 --> 03:38.116

she majored in name-dropping,

"in all four quadrants,

- I can't wait to call her back.
- Great.

03:47.503 --> 03:49.378
And Gabe Eichler
is waiting to talk to you.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.007

- He's one of our writers.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.591
Whoopee.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.343
I'm in a single-income
household,

03:56.345 --> 03:59.513
and Jen and I just had
our second baby, Taylor.

03:59.515 --> 04:01.431
Adorable, huh?

04:01.433 --> 04:03.392
She takes after you.

04:03.394 --> 04:04.685
(CHUCKLING):
Yeah. Thanks.

04:04.687 --> 04:06.436
So there's just
a lot of expenses

04:06.438 --> 04:09.606
at home right now, and...
I think it's time for a raise.

04:09.608 --> 04:11.942
I see.

04:11.944 --> 04:14.695
This is actually
very exciting to me.

04:14.697 --> 04:17.072
- Really? Great.
- Because what you're describing

04:17.074 --> 04:20.575
is the most clear-cut example
of the classic sexist argument

04:20.577 --> 04:22.744
for the advancement of men
in the workplace.

04:22.746 --> 04:24.746
You're asking for a raise
not because of

04:24.748 --> 04:26.164
any work-related contribution
you've made,

04:26.166 --> 04:28.125
but simply because
you have a family.

04:28.127 --> 04:31.044
And that's why, in the 1950s,
family men were promoted

04:31.046 --> 04:32.796
over the women
they worked with.

04:32.798 --> 04:34.381
I've never encountered it,
actually,

04:34.383 --> 04:36.717
in such a clean, teachable way.

04:36.719 --> 04:39.052
I don't think that's at all
what's happening.

04:39.054 --> 04:40.595
I can't give you a raise, Gabe.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.848
- It's like giving a raise to a drug addict.
- What?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.558
Well, your situations
are virtually identical.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.268
A drug addict makes
certain decisions

04:46.270 --> 04:48.270
outside of work
for their sense of self

04:48.272 --> 04:50.230
and comfort,
and then the addiction

04:50.232 --> 04:52.983
demands more time, more energy,
more money, just like a child.

04:52.985 --> 04:55.360
- My child's like a drug problem?
- Exactly.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.154
You want special treatment.
I'm sure you can see

04:57.156 --> 05:00.240
how unfair that would be
to a single man or-or woman.

05:00.242 --> 05:01.825
There are no women
on this staff.

05:01.827 --> 05:03.577
- Gabe.
- And the reason there aren't any women

05:03.579 --> 05:04.953
is because you hate women.

05:04.955 --> 05:07.122
So you can sit there

- What? You want to sit down?

17:56.392 --> 17:58.726
- Okay. Yeah.
- (CHATTER RESUMES)

17:58.728 --> 18:00.436
MANCUSO: Oh, that's where
Mendelsohn sits.

18:00.438 --> 18:02.605
He's in the bathroom, so...

18:02.607 --> 18:05.608
- Okay.
- And that's McCrary's seat.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.276
- Oh.
- KATHERINE: Where is McCrary?

18:07.278 --> 18:09.570
I told everyone
to be here at 8:00.

18:09.572 --> 18:10.571
Oh, he got a call
from his girlfriend,

18:10.573 --> 18:11.906
so it's gonna be a while.

18:11.908 --> 18:13.783
They're actually
newly long-distance,

18:13.785 --> 18:15.159
- and I think it's been really hard for her.
- Has it been?

18:15.161 --> 18:16.536
Has it been hard
for McCrary's girlfriend?

18:16.538 --> 18:18.204
Oh, wow, he must be
such a catch.

18:18.206 --> 18:20.540
- Could you sit down, please?
- Uh, I-I-I want to.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.250
- I'm trying.
- Could you try harder?

18:22.252 --> 18:24.752
Uh, yes.

18:24.754 --> 18:27.129
Oh, okay. I'll just use,
uh, this trash can.

18:27.131 --> 18:30.883
There's... you know, there's
hardly any trash in it at all.

18:30.885 --> 18:32.593
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:32.595 --> 18:35.304
Ooh, it's kind of comfortable.
Better than a chair.

18:35.306 --> 18:36.764
- You're Eight.
- What?

18:36.766 --> 18:38.140
Your name is Eight.

18:38.142 --> 18:39.642
- I'm Molly.
- None of this matters.

18:39.644 --> 18:41.269
Why would anyone care
what your name is?

18:41.271 --> 18:43.187
Do none of you understand
what is at stake here?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.356
I am being replaced
as host of this show

18:45.358 --> 18:48.693
because of declining ratings
and general lack of quality.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.362
- Wait, what?
- The show is great.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.489
Let's see them
do 300 shows a year.

18:53.491 --> 18:54.991
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
- What do they expect?

18:54.993 --> 18:57.243
What do they know?

18:57.245 --> 18:58.746
- What do you think?
- (CHATTER STOPS)

19:00.832 --> 19:02.665
Oh, I think it's horrible.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.292
It's terrible.

19:04.294 --> 19:06.711
It's-it's the worst.
It's... I hate it.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.713
Please stop saying
synonyms for "bad."

19:08.715 --> 19:11.007
Tell me what you think.

19:11.009 --> 19:14.886
If I'm being
completely honest, and...

19:14.888 --> 19:16.470
also acknowledging
how much of a fan

19:16.472 --> 19:18.806
I am of the show
and all of your work,

19:18.808 --> 19:22.268
I think there is room for
a little bit of improvement.

19:22.270 --> 19:23.811
TOM:
Oh, well, sorry the show

19:23.813 --> 19:25.313
doesn't appeal to
the heightened sensibilities

19:25.315 --> 19:26.814
of you and your friends
at the factory.

19:26.816 --> 19:28.691
It's a chemical plant,
not a factory.

19:28.693 --> 19:30.318
- Whatever.
- KATHERINE: Seven's right. It's not the smartest

19:30.320 --> 19:31.861
thing in the world
to come in on your first day

19:31.863 --> 19:33.321
and criticize
a room full of people

19:33.323 --> 19:35.615
who've been doing this
for years, but...

19:35.617 --> 19:37.658
I asked your opinion,

19:37.660 --> 19:40.036
and honestly,
I do not disagree with you.

19:40.038 --> 19:41.787
I've been hearing
a lot of this recently.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.123
Last night, from the person
I know most in the world,

19:44.125 --> 19:46.459
and today, from this person
sitting on a trash can

19:46.461 --> 19:48.127
whom I know the least.

19:48.129 --> 19:50.463
But taking both into account,

19:50.465 --> 19:52.423
the show is bad...
I don't know why...

19:52.425 --> 19:54.258
and I think it's your fault.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.385
I love you, too.

19:56.387 --> 19:57.929
Oh, you must be McCrary.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.639
- Oh, wow.
- How's your girlfriend?

19:59.641 --> 20:01.933
Good. Really good. Yeah,
she just got this new job,

20:01.935 --> 20:03.392
so she's a little emotional.

20:03.394 --> 20:04.518
- She misses me.
- Well, she's gonna be

20:04.520 --> 20:06.062
seeing a lot more of you now,

20:06.064 --> 20:07.438
'cause you're fired.
Could you see him out?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.231
Now, this is what's
gonna happen.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.734
From this moment forth,
none of you has a life.

20:11.736 --> 20:14.403
You have no wives,
no girlfriends, no kids.

20:14.405 --> 20:15.947
You have only this.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.615
You live this show.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.241
You breathe this show.

20:19.243 --> 20:22.078
When you masturbate,
you think about this show.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.913
You're finally going to earn
those big, fat paychecks

20:23.915 --> 20:25.873
that have been paying
for your divorces

20:25.875 --> 20:27.208
and gym memberships
you clearly never use.

20:27.210 --> 20:28.709
Think about
why the show is bad,

20:28.711 --> 20:30.378
and come up with ways
to fix it.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.966
And, Eight, sit on a chair
tomorrow, for God's sake!

20:34.592 --> 20:36.342
Okay.

20:36.344 --> 20:37.885
So...

20:37.887 --> 20:40.721
Can I take
the fired man's seat?

20:40.723 --> 20:42.473
We're all gonna be out of jobs.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.808
I'm gonna have to move
to Long Island City,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.351
probably sell all my clothes.

20:45.353 --> 20:47.269
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Oh, how would you know?

20:47.271 --> 20:48.646
You don't even have
nice clothes.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.231
Okay, it's not
all that surprising.

20:50.233 --> 20:51.649
Any of your friends talk
about the show anymore?

20:51.651 --> 20:52.942
No, it's a relic.
Okay? There's no buzz

20:52.944 --> 20:54.443
- about it at all.
- No. - TOM: Hey.

20:54.445 --> 20:56.070
It's not a relic, okay?
She is an icon.

20:56.072 --> 20:57.321
I mean,
it would take them a month

20:57.323 --> 20:58.572
just to remove
all of her Emmys.

20:58.574 --> 21:00.116
Well, you know, who knows?

21:00.118 --> 21:01.534
Maybe Little Miss
Chemical Plant can help us.

21:01.536 --> 21:03.202
TOM: Please, don't even
joke about that.

21:03.204 --> 21:04.954
You know what, Reynolds?
Give me one of your Xanaxes.

21:04.956 --> 21:06.122
No, I need all my Xannies
now that I'm in the poorhouse.

21:06.124 --> 21:09.250
Molly Patel!
Molly Patel,

21:09.252 --> 21:12.253
- the quality control specialist.
- TOM: Oh, my God.

21:12.255 --> 21:14.714
MANCUSO: Hobbies include
ruining our lives.

21:14.716 --> 21:17.216
TOM: I don't think she's worked
a day in television.

21:17.218 --> 21:18.926
You know, I think
she's a pathological liar.

21:18.928 --> 21:21.429
I wish I was a woman of color
so I could just get

21:21.431 --> 21:23.139
any job I want
with zero qualifications.

21:23.141 --> 21:25.266
We talked about this.
You can't say that.

21:25.268 --> 21:27.977
(CHUCKLING)

21:27.979 --> 21:29.353
Hey, man.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.355
You remember, uh,
Molly from earlier?

21:31.357 --> 21:33.774
Yes. She told everyone
the show was bad.

21:33.776 --> 21:36.736
That's her. You'll be sharing
an office with her.

21:36.738 --> 21:38.740
Brad? Brad. Brad?

21:41.325 --> 21:43.200
This is nice. Who's that?

21:43.202 --> 21:44.910
That's the guy
whose desk you're taking.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.079
He was fired last week.

21:47.081 --> 21:49.500
He was my best friend.

21:59.427 --> 22:03.596
So...
you must be pretty new, too.

22:03.598 --> 22:05.058
You don't have any stuff.

22:06.267 --> 22:09.101
Oh, I-I've been here 27 years.

22:09.103 --> 22:11.939
In case I get fired, I don't
want to get too comfortable.

22:14.150 --> 22:17.359
So, are you gonna tell me
about your day?

22:17.361 --> 22:19.153
It was a bit like
trying to mount

22:19.155 --> 22:20.529
a prison production
of Hamlet.

22:20.531 --> 22:22.198
But at least prisoners
get sunlight

22:22.200 --> 22:24.742
- and exercise once a day.
- (LAUGHS)

22:24.744 --> 22:26.702
That sounds very promising.

22:26.704 --> 22:28.871
You always worked best
with a captive audience.

22:28.873 --> 22:31.415
(LAUGHS)

22:31.417 --> 22:33.459
Right now it is
a hostile environment

22:33.461 --> 22:35.711
in which to be
an educated white male.

22:35.713 --> 22:38.380
I mean, it's staggering
how unfair it is, okay?

22:38.382 --> 22:40.716
Staggering.

22:40.718 --> 22:42.384
Yeah, they completely
overlooked my brother.

22:42.386 --> 22:43.969
All right.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.346
She's, like, a diversity hire
or something.

22:45.348 --> 22:46.806
Man, she'll be here 13 weeks.

22:46.808 --> 22:48.601
She's, like,
a single mom or something.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.520
Hey.

22:52.522 --> 22:54.188
I'm not a single mom,
by the way.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.439
I just look like one.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.066
And I guess I dress like one.

22:57.068 --> 22:59.527
No, I...
I-I wasn't talking about you.

22:59.529 --> 23:01.612
- Then who were you talking about?
- Uh, my...

23:01.614 --> 23:03.280
cleaning lady.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.992
Your brother lost a job
to your housekeeper?

23:06.035 --> 23:07.409
- Yep.
- Whatever.

23:07.411 --> 23:08.869
Just so you know,
I'd rather be

23:08.871 --> 23:10.329
a diversity hire
than a nepotism hire.

23:10.331 --> 23:12.039
'Cause at least
I had to beat out

23:12.041 --> 23:13.499
every minority and woman
to get here.

23:13.501 --> 23:17.211
You just had to be born.

23:17.213 --> 23:19.880
TOM: Hey, you know, one of my
grandparents was an immigrant.

23:19.882 --> 23:21.757
This documentary was insane.

23:21.759 --> 23:23.217
It said, basically,
we're all covered

23:23.219 --> 23:25.052
in, like, tiny bugs and...

23:25.054 --> 23:27.265
- Oh.
- No cupcakes today.

23:38.901 --> 23:41.360
So, Molly, what is your deal?

23:41.362 --> 23:44.488
Well, I am from central
Pennsylvania. I love to laugh.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.532
No, boring.
Like, what do you hate?

23:46.534 --> 23:48.993
What neighborhood do you
live in? Who are you fucking?

23:48.995 --> 23:51.829
Uh, I, uh... I hate injustice.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.330
(TOM SCOFFS)

23:53.332 --> 23:55.708
I live with my aunt
and uncle in Queens.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.960
And I'm not sleeping
with anybody.

23:57.962 --> 24:00.045
- Where'd you go to school?
- Luzerne Community College.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.006
- Loser Community College?
- (LAUGHTER)

24:02.008 --> 24:04.175
- Luzerne.
- Oh, 'cause it really sounded like you said "loser."

24:04.177 --> 24:06.385
- Yeah, but why would I say that?
- Don't listen to them.

24:06.387 --> 24:08.554
I dropped out of high school
and worked at the docks.

24:08.556 --> 24:10.389
That's why I write
so many jokes about seagulls.

24:10.391 --> 24:12.600
So, what is the stage like?
I cannot wait to see it.

24:12.602 --> 24:14.518
We're not allowed on the stage.
Only Brad and Tom.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.312
TOM: Yeah,
I'm head monologue writer.

24:16.314 --> 24:18.772
You are? 'Cause you hadn't
mentioned it in ten minutes.

24:18.774 --> 24:20.149
- I was worried.
- (LAUGHS)

24:20.151 --> 24:21.567
Wait, so you all write
on the show,

24:21.569 --> 24:23.154
and you've never been
to the stage?

24:24.197 --> 24:25.696
Okay. Okay.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.531
This is how it works.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.158
The writers are supposed

24:29.160 --> 24:31.493
- to get here at 10:00.
- Good morning.

24:31.495 --> 24:33.495
I usually get here at 9:00.

24:33.497 --> 24:35.206
Then we go into our offices
and read

24:35.208 --> 24:36.916
the newspaper headlines
for joke ideas.

24:36.918 --> 24:39.793
Some of us are a little more
focused than others.

24:39.795 --> 24:41.879
Then we submit our jokes to
Brad, who makes his selects.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.839
That's what makes it
in the show.

24:43.841 --> 24:45.382
- Here you go.
- I usually get some good stuff in there.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.926
Ah!

24:46.928 --> 24:48.260
Then we meet up
in the writers' room

24:48.262 --> 24:49.887
to go over Brad's selects.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.348
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Oh, kiss my ass!

24:52.350 --> 24:54.308
Then at 6:30,
the show starts taping,

24:54.310 --> 24:55.684
and we all watch.

24:55.686 --> 24:58.604
And that is how we make
a TV show.

24:58.606 --> 25:01.941
So you never interact with her
once the entire day?

25:01.943 --> 25:04.237
Until yesterday, most of us
hadn't even met her.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.489
- (TOILET FLUSHES)
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

25:08.491 --> 25:09.740
I thought this was
the women's room.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.367
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

25:11.369 --> 25:12.826
You're right. It is...
it is the women's room.

25:12.828 --> 25:14.328
We just... we haven't had
a woman here

25:14.330 --> 25:17.206
in, like, ever,
so yeah, we use it.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.832
Doesn't Katherine mind?

25:18.834 --> 25:20.292
You kidding me?
No, she doesn't come in here.

25:20.294 --> 25:21.669
She has her own bathroom.

25:21.671 --> 25:23.837
We actually...
we-we come in here to...

25:23.839 --> 25:25.589
to take a shit.

25:25.591 --> 25:29.551
I don't understand anything
about this job.

25:29.553 --> 25:32.054
Well, you're right about
not being allowed on set.

25:32.056 --> 25:33.389
It's fucked up.

25:33.391 --> 25:35.140
So, why don't you say
something?

25:35.142 --> 25:37.309
(LAUGHS) Like,
"See Something, Say Something"?

25:37.311 --> 25:39.311
Because it's not
airport security, Molly.

25:39.313 --> 25:40.813
It's a TV show.

25:40.815 --> 25:45.317
And she's not the, uh,
classy role model

25:45.319 --> 25:47.780
you've been watching
on TV for 20 years.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.032
Hey, you know... you know what?

25:52.034 --> 25:54.159
I'm doing stand-up
tomorrow night, all right?

25:54.161 --> 25:55.703
Come see me.

25:55.705 --> 25:57.748
We'll get a drink after.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.294
(DOOR OPENS)

26:02.378 --> 26:03.752
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:03.754 --> 26:05.129
Okay.
Let's get going, everybody.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.964
One, you're up.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.466
I have an idea entitled
"Hollywood Zoo."

26:09.468 --> 26:11.635
It's animals
that look like celebrities.

26:11.637 --> 26:14.888
- No.
- And... or celebrities that look like animals?

26:14.890 --> 26:16.849
Can I? Okay.

26:16.851 --> 26:19.270
"Shrimp My Ride."

26:20.479 --> 26:22.062
"Fancy Pelosi."

26:22.064 --> 26:24.815
"Celebrity Fitted-Sheet
Folding Challenge."

26:24.817 --> 26:26.358
Yeah, we worked
on that together.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.651
It's where we have you
and a celebrity race

26:27.653 --> 26:28.986
to fold a fitted sheet.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.988
(CHUCKLES)
You know what? Forget it.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.532
Can I just remind
everybody here

26:33.534 --> 26:37.119
that the stakes
could not be higher.

26:37.121 --> 26:38.787
- Two, go.
- Uh, okay.

26:38.789 --> 26:40.539
So, the Miss America pageant

26:40.541 --> 26:42.499
and the Westminster Dog Show
are both the same week.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.335
So I thought,
why not combine the two?

26:44.337 --> 26:45.961
We ask the girls
to run around in a circle,

26:45.963 --> 26:48.130
and we ask the dogs
their take on immigration.

26:48.132 --> 26:50.424
Oh, the Miss America pageant.

26:50.426 --> 26:52.551
The scholarship competition
where it's still appropriate

26:52.553 --> 26:54.303
to ask a beautiful teenager
from Tampa

26:54.305 --> 26:55.679
who can't afford college

26:55.681 --> 26:57.723
but who can afford
breast implants

26:57.725 --> 26:59.099
about world peace.

26:59.101 --> 27:00.059
No, we're not gonna be
doing that.

27:00.061 --> 27:01.143
Where's John Phillips?

27:01.145 --> 27:02.061
I want to hear his pitches.

27:02.063 --> 27:04.607
- Um...
- Um...

27:06.067 --> 27:07.232
What?

27:07.234 --> 27:10.819
Uh, John died in 2012.

27:10.821 --> 27:12.446
John's dead?
Are you kidding me?

27:12.448 --> 27:15.157
About the death
of our coworker? No.

27:15.159 --> 27:16.700
Oh, that's terrible.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.119
- He was so funny.
- Yeah.

27:19.121 --> 27:20.996
Eight, what?

27:20.998 --> 27:23.415
First of all,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.167
He sounded like
an incredible person.

27:25.169 --> 27:27.544
Second, I'm really honored

27:27.546 --> 27:29.588
to be presenting my ideas
here today.

27:29.590 --> 27:31.632
Oh, God, I wish I was
John Phillips.

27:31.634 --> 27:33.509
So, I thought I would
take a step back

27:33.511 --> 27:35.260
and see what wasn't working.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.137
This is what I do
at quality control

27:37.139 --> 27:39.390
at the chemical plant, and I
thought I would do that here.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.851
The headline of my analysis
is "Complacency."

27:42.853 --> 27:45.521
And I noticed that there's
three major areas

27:45.523 --> 27:47.314
where there could be
a lot of improvement.

27:47.316 --> 27:49.441
The first is your
overall unwillingness to do

27:49.443 --> 27:51.318
high-concept recurring bits...
you know, where you have to

27:51.320 --> 27:53.112
physically leave the studio.

27:53.114 --> 27:55.322
Those are the ones that can
go viral if executed well.

27:55.324 --> 27:59.284
The second is your total lack
of presence on social media.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.662
You seem to have contempt
for it, which feels ill-advised

28:01.664 --> 28:04.289
because most of your audience
is watching on their phones.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.417
The third:
I think people get very excited

28:06.419 --> 28:08.210
when you share your beliefs.

28:08.212 --> 28:10.212
So, what you just said
about the Miss America pageant,

28:10.214 --> 28:11.839
that was awesome.

28:11.841 --> 28:13.841
When you reveal those kind
of strong opinions,

28:13.843 --> 28:16.009
it's when you really
come alive as a performer.

28:16.011 --> 28:18.512
That's when I come alive
as a performer?

28:18.514 --> 28:20.305
- Yeah.
- Can I see that?

28:20.307 --> 28:22.226
Absolutely.

28:23.978 --> 28:25.894
I just want to say,
I'm no longer attached

28:25.896 --> 28:27.563
to this idea
in any shape or form.

28:27.565 --> 28:29.982

28:39.118 --> 28:41.326
Oh, I don't have one.

28:41.328 --> 28:43.912
Just to be clear, you don't
have any new ideas or jokes?

28:43.914 --> 28:45.956

28:45.958 --> 28:47.833
KATHERINE: Okay,
I've been doing this job

28:47.835 --> 28:49.460

and I know what works.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.378
And I'll tell you
what doesn't work:

28:51.380 --> 28:53.422
an absurdly confident newcomer
coming in, criticizing my show

28:53.424 --> 28:56.717
and giving me her assessment
of my comic persona

28:56.719 --> 28:59.636
without doing the hard work of
presenting me with solutions.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.680
This-this room is a ship.

29:01.682 --> 29:03.348

29:03.350 --> 29:04.892
earned the right to be an oar.

29:04.894 --> 29:07.938
Do I make myself clear, Eight?

29:09.106 --> 29:11.815
(SIGHS)
I have not changed.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.734

They don't want smart comedy.

what they want.

famous person out there?

52:23.374 --> 52:27.042
Look. I am a dark-skinned
Indian woman.

52:27.044 --> 52:28.878
- Aren't I un-fireable?
- (LAUGHTER)

52:28.880 --> 52:31.589

died from it.

52:35.803 --> 52:38.345

- I think she works at Colbert.

- She works for me.
- MOLLY: See, now

52:54.238 --> 52:56.697
Our next performer, uh, uh...

52:56.699 --> 52:59.325

Thank you. Now shut up.

53:18.262 --> 53:19.678
So, I joined Twitter.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.597
I didn't want to.
My publicist made me.

53:21.599 --> 53:24.058
And... (SIGHS)
I was okay at first.

53:24.060 --> 53:26.101
I was... with the twittering
and the tweeting,

53:26.103 --> 53:28.020
but do you know
where it lost me?

53:28.022 --> 53:31.023
Fave-ing. Fave-ing.

53:31.025 --> 53:34.902
Because "fave" is short
for "favorite," right?

53:34.904 --> 53:37.947
But you can only have
one favorite.

53:37.949 --> 53:39.573
You can only have one.

53:39.575 --> 53:41.661
You can't have lots
of favorites. It's stupid.

53:43.204 --> 53:44.453
F-Faves. Faves.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.455
They can't all be
your favorite.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.959

in the audience tonight, I see.

54:12.191 --> 54:15.359

away from me.

54:15.361 --> 54:17.945

54:17.947 --> 54:19.991
Yeah, that's happening.

54:21.951 --> 54:24.912
They're taking my show away,
and the thing is...

54:29.166 --> 54:33.877
The thing is,
if they take my show away,

54:33.879 --> 54:37.633

what I am going to do.

54:39.593 --> 54:42.722

54:54.358 --> 54:56.485
You know what? I've got it.

54:58.446 --> 55:00.362

Sean Penn's grandmother

55:00.364 --> 55:02.656

is married to Emma Stone.

55:02.658 --> 55:05.784

55:14.295 --> 55:15.836
I'm too old to play the Mummy.

55:15.838 --> 55:17.671
They'd get Anne Hathaway in
to play the Mummy

55:17.673 --> 55:19.173
and put, like,
Mummy makeup on her.

55:19.175 --> 55:20.591

55:20.593 --> 55:22.301

I'm gonna have to have, like,
Botox and lip filler

doing to my life right now.

You were too scared to tell me
what you really think,

56:36.585 --> 56:38.796
and I think I was too scared
to hear the truth.

I am the only woman in
late-night network television,

56:44.718 --> 56:48.470
but I have been doing the same
format and the same jokes...

56:48.472 --> 56:52.266

as some of these other guys.

56:52.268 --> 56:53.767
So, what are you saying?

56:53.769 --> 56:54.935
You want more jokes
about female issues?

56:54.937 --> 56:56.270
No, Seven, I-I'm not asking you

56:56.272 --> 56:58.021
to write me a tight five
on menstruation.

56:58.023 --> 57:00.357
I just want to say only things
I can talk about.

57:00.359 --> 57:02.025
Nothing is off-limits.
If you think it's funny,

57:02.027 --> 57:03.652
I don't care
how personal it is.

57:03.654 --> 57:06.613
I am a 56-year-old Englishwoman

who has never given birth
or seen a superhero film.

Write to that.
You cannot offend me.

If you don't know enough
about me, come and talk to me.

57:14.123 --> 57:15.914
I swear I will not
scream at you.

57:15.916 --> 57:18.834
I want it to be specific,
and I want it to be political.

57:18.836 --> 57:20.794
I'm gonna do the abortion joke
tomorrow, and, Seven,

57:20.796 --> 57:22.171
she's writing monologue jokes
with you.

Uh... sorry, I'm not

I can't teach a total novice
how to write jokes overnight.

57:28.012 --> 57:30.220
(CHUCKLES) No. I hate
to break this to you, Seven,

57:30.222 --> 57:31.930
but you're not gonna be
teaching anything,

57:31.932 --> 57:34.099
because I want someone
who doesn't think in exactly

57:34.101 --> 57:36.101
the same way as everyone else
in the goddamn room.

57:36.103 --> 57:37.519

monologue jokes with you.

58:28.322 --> 58:30.572
Okay. Those are facts.

58:30.574 --> 58:32.785
What the fuck can I do
about that?

58:34.453 --> 58:37.704
So, recently,
someone accused me of being,

58:37.706 --> 58:40.999
quote, "a little bit old
and a little bit white."

58:41.001 --> 58:44.044

"I'm very old and very white."

But what can a person like me
do about that?

58:48.759 --> 58:51.218

I can come across

58:51.220 --> 58:53.595
as trying to be some sort
of white savior.

58:53.597 --> 58:55.389
Then I decided
I was okay with that,

Okay.
Well, that's demoralizing.

59:08.195 --> 59:10.737

been any instance recently

treated differently

called Lydia Stoker.

a lot of research for this.

- I'll start to watch that show.
- Mm-hmm.

Kind of a guilty pleasure?

01:00:17.806 --> 01:00:19.058
Well, you know what I think?

There's no such thing
as guilty pleasures...
