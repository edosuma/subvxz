00:00.808 --> 00:02.708
Hi, i'm Chuck. Here's a few
things you might need to know.

00:02.744 --> 00:04.177
Your dreams are also proof

00:04.178 --> 00:07.881
of stress the Intersect puts
on your brain,

00:07.949 --> 00:09.950
likely leading
to serious

00:10.017 --> 00:11.952
mental deterioration.

00:12.019 --> 00:14.321
Shaw, you're not
bleeding anymore.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.756
That's right, Chuck,
I'm not.

00:15.757 --> 00:16.757
What does that mean?

00:16.758 --> 00:18.658
It means I'm still alive.

00:19.227 --> 00:22.129
You work for the CIA?
This is about your father.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.464
There are some very bad
people looking for him,

00:24.532 --> 00:26.199
including a man
named John Casey.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.635
Last time he left, he made sure
that I had a way to contact him.

âª âª

01:47.248 --> 01:49.182
Justin.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.250
Ellie, hey.

01:50.251 --> 01:51.284
Hey, I contacted my dad.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.352
Can we meet?

01:52.353 --> 01:54.020
Yeah, same place
as last time, okay?

01:54.021 --> 01:55.789
Okay, I'll be there
in ten minutes.

01:55.790 --> 01:56.790
<i>Hey,</i>

01:56.791 --> 01:58.358
Morgan, hey, buddy.

01:58.359 --> 02:01.361
Listen, I had another dream
last night.

02:01.429 --> 02:03.630
It was about Shaw.

02:03.698 --> 02:06.399
No, I haven't told Sarah yet.

02:06.467 --> 02:08.634
Yes, I realize that honesty
is important in a relationship.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.136
Who do you think I am?

02:10.137 --> 02:12.038
Listen, just meet me at the
Buy More in, like, ten or 15.

02:12.106 --> 02:13.507
Okay?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.775
Whose relationship are
you talking about? Huh?

02:15.843 --> 02:17.410
Uh... Morgan's, Morgan's.

02:17.411 --> 02:18.712
Yeah, Morgan and Anna,
the past-

02:18.713 --> 02:20.714
he's just been really tore up
about her lately, so...

02:20.781 --> 02:23.950
Oh, I thought he
rejected her recently.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.252
He did, he did, he did,

02:25.253 --> 02:27.120
but the heart is a...
is a very, it's...

02:27.121 --> 02:29.723
the heart is
a very complicated muscle.

02:29.790 --> 02:31.791
Have I told you how beautiful
you look this morning?

02:31.859 --> 02:32.926
I mean, just... aah!

02:32.927 --> 02:34.827
Really,
and you smell...

02:34.929 --> 02:36.596
...fantastic, too.

02:36.597 --> 02:38.265
Oh, hey, maybe that was
just the Pop-Tart.

02:38.266 --> 02:40.567
I got to go, bye.

02:40.635 --> 02:42.869
Bye.

02:43.938 --> 02:45.372
<i>Wait, wait,</i>

02:45.373 --> 02:46.940
you dreamt Shaw was alive?

02:46.941 --> 02:48.808
Chuck, you saw
him die, though.

02:48.809 --> 02:50.577
You checked for
a pulse, right?

02:50.578 --> 02:52.245
Well, he fell
into a river.

02:52.246 --> 02:53.947
He fell into a river?!
Of course Shaw's alive!

02:53.948 --> 02:55.848
Haven't you ever seen
a John Carpenter movie?

02:55.883 --> 02:57.217
Buddy, are you going
to help me or what?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.118
I can't tell Sarah
until I'm absolutely sure

02:59.153 --> 03:00.687
because she has...
History with the man.

03:00.688 --> 03:01.855
I know, I'm aware.

03:01.856 --> 03:03.290
Chuck, the thing is:
if he's alive,

03:03.291 --> 03:04.324
then he knows
everything about her

03:04.325 --> 03:05.759
and he knows
everything about you,

03:05.760 --> 03:09.362
everything about me- where I
work, where I live, what I eat,

03:09.430 --> 03:11.031
shower...
Hey, buddy, hey, yo, Morgan.

03:11.032 --> 03:12.732
This is
why we are going

03:12.733 --> 03:15.368
to find him and figure out
what he's up to, okay,

03:15.436 --> 03:17.203
but first I need to take care
of a few things here.

03:17.204 --> 03:19.506
Remember, though,
this is between you and I.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.574
Stay between me and you.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.575
Okay, no problem, absolutely.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.742
Listen, do me a favor:

03:22.743 --> 03:24.110
before you go,
can you key me into Castle?

03:24.111 --> 03:25.712
I left something down there.

03:25.713 --> 03:27.147
Look, if you're
really afraid of Shaw,

03:27.148 --> 03:29.115
I'll let you down there for
a little while. Thank you.

03:29.183 --> 03:32.018
Thank you, you are a
lifesaver, sir, literally.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.487
Yeah, good, okay, fine,
just-just don't touch anything.

03:34.555 --> 03:36.455
Okay?
All right.

03:44.298 --> 03:46.198
Okay, okay, okay.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.234
Good, good, good, good.

03:48.302 --> 03:50.804
Yes, oh, baby.

03:50.871 --> 03:52.771
Come on.
Morgan.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.375
What are you doing here?

03:55.443 --> 03:56.710
Is Chuck up to something?

03:56.711 --> 03:57.877
I don't know, you tell me.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.112
You'd know better than I would.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.580
Hey, have you seen, uh,

04:00.581 --> 04:02.248
where they keep
the bulletproof pants?

04:02.249 --> 04:05.085
You know, Morgan,
you and I-

04:05.152 --> 04:07.721
we, uh, we never
talk, really.

04:07.788 --> 04:09.222
Yeah, well,
talking's a bit overrated.

04:09.223 --> 04:10.857
Plus, we don't have
a lot in common,

04:10.858 --> 04:12.225
although I'd like to get
to know you better.

04:12.226 --> 04:13.393
I mean, I don't feel
like there's...

04:13.394 --> 04:15.962
Sit.
Okay.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.132
You're going
to tell me

04:20.134 --> 04:22.802
exactly what's going on and
you're going to do it right now.

04:33.781 --> 04:37.050
Reviewing pictures
of people you killed?

04:37.118 --> 04:39.386
I do that myself
from time to time.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.855
No.

04:41.922 --> 04:43.289
Chuck.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.924
Chuck, we goa problem, bro.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.092
Sarah knows about Shaw.

04:46.093 --> 04:47.494
Yeah, yeah,
I broke, man.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.595
Okay, y-your lady's
really intimidating.

04:48.596 --> 04:49.929
You know, I tried
to make eye contact,

04:49.930 --> 04:51.364
but she just kind of kept
pulling me in with this...

04:51.365 --> 04:52.666
this gaze.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.403
Morgan, how could you poss...
W- what is, what...?

04:56.470 --> 04:57.504
Is that a bulletproof vest?

04:57.505 --> 04:58.872
No, is that a
bulletproof tie?

04:58.873 --> 04:59.873
I don't...

04:59.874 --> 05:01.774
I don't know what...
Give me a break.

05:04.311 --> 05:07.147
That's my dad.

05:07.214 --> 05:08.515
Why is my dad here?

05:08.516 --> 05:09.716
What's the problem?
He thinks

05:09.717 --> 05:11.384
I quit the CIA the night
of Ellie's wedding.

05:11.385 --> 05:14.320
He does not know that
I downloaded the Intersect 2.0.

05:14.388 --> 05:15.388
W- W-W-Wait,

05:15.389 --> 05:16.890
wait, you didn't tell him?

05:16.891 --> 05:17.991
Well, he spent
so much time

05:17.992 --> 05:19.225
getting the damn thing
out of my ad.

05:19.226 --> 05:21.661
Why would I tell him that?
Mush, mush, mush, mush.

05:21.729 --> 05:24.631
Hi, hey, Dad, hi.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.865
How are you?

05:25.866 --> 05:27.767
What, uh, what are you...
what are you doing here?

05:27.835 --> 05:28.968
Your sister contacted me.

05:28.969 --> 05:30.637
I wanted to check
with you and make sure

05:30.638 --> 05:31.638
that everything was okay.

05:31.639 --> 05:33.539
Is that...?

05:34.408 --> 05:36.409
Is that John Casey?

05:36.477 --> 05:37.977
That is John Casey.

05:37.978 --> 05:39.979
Of course, yeah,
you know that he works here.

05:40.047 --> 05:42.282
Why? He's an NSA agent,

05:42.349 --> 05:44.284
and if the Intersect
project was disbanded,

05:44.351 --> 05:45.318
why would he...?

05:45.319 --> 05:47.353
Shaw?

05:47.421 --> 05:49.956
Sarah, you remember
my father.

05:50.024 --> 05:52.992
Oh, hi, Mr. Bartowski.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.828
I- It's great
to see you.

05:54.829 --> 05:56.162
Why is your handler here?

05:56.163 --> 05:58.832
Handler... no.

05:58.899 --> 06:00.667
Oh, you've been
out of the loop,

06:00.668 --> 06:02.202
so I can't expect you
to know this,

06:02.203 --> 06:04.637
but-but Sarah and I are
boyfriend and girlfriend now.

06:04.705 --> 06:06.106
Hi, sweetie.

06:06.107 --> 06:09.075
Tell me that you're not
in the CIA anymore.

06:09.143 --> 06:10.243
Tell me that you quit.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.579
Dad, the Intersect
is out of my head.

06:12.646 --> 06:13.847
I've moved on.

06:13.848 --> 06:17.517
<i>I can assure you-
we can assure you...</i>

06:19.286 --> 06:21.454
...that I am no longer a spy.

06:21.522 --> 06:24.157
You know me,
I wouldn't lie.

06:28.205 --> 06:32.803
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

07:08.989 --> 07:09.989
This is Incredible.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.224
From the outside it looks like
a regular office building.

07:12.292 --> 07:13.526
Well, that's the point.

07:13.527 --> 07:14.727
We're the CIA.

07:14.728 --> 07:16.329
Nothing's what it seems.

07:16.330 --> 07:18.564
Right this way.
Okay.

07:27.541 --> 07:29.475
So you were able
to contact your dad?

07:29.543 --> 07:31.043
You could say that.

07:31.044 --> 07:32.545
He's, uh,

07:32.546 --> 07:34.513
he's a little neurotic.

07:34.581 --> 07:37.550
A coded message in the
classified section is his way

07:37.617 --> 07:39.919
of getting
in tch with me.

07:42.222 --> 07:44.156
Perfect.

07:44.224 --> 07:45.858
So, once he tells
you where he lives,

07:45.859 --> 07:48.961
we'll be able to protect him
and you can tell him everything.

07:49.029 --> 07:51.230
What about John Casey?

07:51.298 --> 07:52.365
If he's
a double agent...

07:52.366 --> 07:53.532
Ellie, he's been living
in your building

07:53.533 --> 07:55.167
for three years, just observing.

07:55.168 --> 07:57.103
There's no reason to think
that'll change now.

07:57.170 --> 08:01.841
But... this may put
your mind at ease.

08:02.843 --> 08:04.377
That's a speaker.

08:04.378 --> 08:05.544
I don't understand.

08:05.545 --> 08:09.482
Like I said, nothing's
what it seems.

08:09.549 --> 08:10.916
It's not really
a speaker.

08:10.917 --> 08:12.385
It'll protect you.

08:12.386 --> 08:14.487
It'll block all of Agent
Casey's audio and visual reads

08:14.554 --> 08:16.155
on the courtyard,

08:16.156 --> 08:17.423
and, Ellie, if you
ever feel nervous,

08:17.424 --> 08:19.324
even for a second,
just call me.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.560
You know you can trust me,
right?

08:23.063 --> 08:25.131
I do.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.500
I think you should tell
your dad the truth.

08:28.501 --> 08:30.469
I mean, you need to be honest
with the people that you love,

08:30.537 --> 08:33.506
and that goes
for me, too.

08:33.573 --> 08:35.006
I know, I know,
Sarah, I'm sorry.

08:35.008 --> 08:36.909
I wanted to tell you about
Shaw, but it was just a dream,

08:36.977 --> 08:38.811
and I-and I wanted to be
sure before I worried you.

08:38.812 --> 08:40.046
But if you dreamt
that Shaw was alive,

08:40.047 --> 08:42.114
then you dreamt it
for a reason.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.616
I mean, the doctor said
that you're healthy

08:43.616 --> 08:45.918
and that your dreams could be
as accurate as your flashes.

08:45.919 --> 08:48.154
Right?
Ye... uh, yeah,

08:48.221 --> 08:50.289
yeah, that's right.
Let's hope so.

08:50.357 --> 08:52.658
I'm not letting you go to
Beckman till we know for sure.

08:52.726 --> 08:55.194
I ran a scan on all of
Shaw's known aliases.

08:55.262 --> 08:57.596
No activity since Paris.

08:57.664 --> 08:59.698
I think our best shot
at finding him is Walker.

08:59.766 --> 09:01.200
Why?

09:01.201 --> 09:02.735
W- Why?

09:02.736 --> 09:05.805
She has an... intimate knowledge
of the target.

09:05.872 --> 09:08.707
I think "intimate" is a-is a
bit of a... bit of a stretch.

09:08.775 --> 09:11.677
If Walker goes through all
the places she went with Shaw,

09:11.745 --> 09:12.912
all the things they did,

09:12.913 --> 09:14.080
maybe you'll flash

09:14.081 --> 09:15.748
on something that leads to him.

09:15.749 --> 09:17.817
Would you be okay
with that, Chuck?

09:17.884 --> 09:20.119
Of course. Of course.

09:20.153 --> 09:22.053
Why wouldn't I b

09:23.190 --> 09:26.525
So, what exactly
did you and Shaw do

09:26.593 --> 09:27.993
when you were in D.C.?

09:27.994 --> 09:29.428
Casey...

09:29.429 --> 09:32.198
...they were in and out of
meetings all day, every day.

09:32.265 --> 09:33.933
I mean, the trip
was purely spy-related.

09:33.934 --> 09:34.934
All business, no pleasure.

09:34.935 --> 09:35.935
Well,

09:35.936 --> 09:37.269
Walker, I have
here a receipt

09:37.270 --> 09:39.605
from a waterfront
restaurant named Le Jardin.

09:39.673 --> 09:41.307
Two chef's
tasting menus,

09:41.308 --> 09:42.775
couple of nice
bottles of Pinot...

09:42.776 --> 09:44.977
Doesn't sound like business
to me.

09:54.821 --> 09:58.224
After our couples massage,
he toome to Tiffany's.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.692
Did he buy you
anything? Please.

09:59.693 --> 10:02.595
Everybody knows that you go to
Tiffany's to browse, not buy.

10:02.662 --> 10:05.164
Are those new earrings,
Agent Walker?

10:12.772 --> 10:15.508
Okay, so, on March 22,

10:15.575 --> 10:18.010
you and Shaw were off-
grid the whole day.

10:18.078 --> 10:19.678
What exactly
were you doing?

10:19.679 --> 10:21.447
Objection.
Relevance?

10:21.448 --> 10:23.983
What was so compelling
that you didn't check in?

10:24.050 --> 10:26.519
We spent the day in his
loft downtown, okay,

10:26.586 --> 10:28.486
at the Hoff Building.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.261
Mm-hmm.

10:35.262 --> 10:36.362
Was it the penthouse?

10:36.363 --> 10:37.563
Yes.

10:37.564 --> 10:38.564
Did you flash?

10:38.565 --> 10:40.399
Shaw ordered the CIA
to construct

10:40.400 --> 10:42.735
a TR-15 safe in his penthouse.

10:42.802 --> 10:45.271
Whatever he's hiding in there
could lead us to him.

10:45.338 --> 10:48.007
Looks like we're going to get
to see Shaw's bachelor pad,

10:48.074 --> 10:50.009
although for some of us,
it won't be the first time.

10:50.076 --> 10:54.947
âª Ooh, ooh, love hurts âª

10:55.015 --> 10:57.683
âª Love scars âª

10:57.751 --> 11:02.521
âª Love wounds and mars âª

11:02.589 --> 11:05.658
âª Any heart âª

11:05.725 --> 11:07.493
âª Not tough... âª
Hey.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.727
Excuse me.
Yes?

11:08.728 --> 11:10.628
Please, stop.

11:13.767 --> 11:14.934
Awkward.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.669
And cruel, but not incorrect,

11:16.670 --> 11:18.604
because you are not playing
from your soul.

11:18.672 --> 11:20.439
You're soulless
in Seattle.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.275
That's quite a wad of cash you
hustled on Buy More property.

11:23.343 --> 11:24.777
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
This is our dream.

11:24.778 --> 11:26.245
We're on break.
You can't touch us.

11:26.246 --> 11:27.546
I don't want
to touch you.

11:27.547 --> 11:29.081
I want to help you.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.549
In case you forgot,

11:30.550 --> 11:32.518
I know a thing or two
about management.

11:32.586 --> 11:34.253
You're too good
to be playing

11:34.254 --> 11:36.522
outside a chain
electronics store.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.057
If I was your manager,

11:38.058 --> 11:40.226
<i>you might be playing inside
a chain electronics store.</i>

11:40.293 --> 11:41.727
Yeah, we've already
played the Buy More.

11:41.728 --> 11:43.796
We don't need you.
I'm listening.

11:43.863 --> 11:45.531
What?

11:45.532 --> 11:47.900
Having a manager
means having respect.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.636
How many times do I have
to tell you? Art: good.

11:50.704 --> 11:53.539
Commercialism:
bad, evil, weird... chubby.

11:53.607 --> 11:55.507
But you know what?
I'm... I'm tired of it.

11:55.575 --> 11:57.910
You want his empty words and
his razzmatazz wordplay,

11:57.978 --> 12:00.079
you take it.
You take it, and you go solo,

12:00.146 --> 12:02.181
and you see how that
works out for you.

12:02.249 --> 12:04.950
Just try and stop me
from walking away.

12:05.018 --> 12:06.986
Just try and stop me.

12:07.053 --> 12:08.454
You just try.

12:08.455 --> 12:09.588
You try and stop me from...

12:09.589 --> 12:10.656
You're not going to even...?

12:10.657 --> 12:12.124
That's what...
you know what, fine.

12:12.125 --> 12:13.859
But I'm ing to take something
with me

12:13.860 --> 12:15.794
that you can never have back.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.762
The 'ster!

12:19.499 --> 12:21.033
As in Jeffster!

12:21.034 --> 12:22.934
Take the...

12:28.742 --> 12:30.642
Dad.

12:32.746 --> 12:33.846
What is going on?

12:33.847 --> 12:35.047
How did you
get in here?

12:35.048 --> 12:36.248
Ellie, hi.
Hi.

12:36.249 --> 12:38.450
Dad, I told you that I
wanted to come to you.

12:38.518 --> 12:39.518
You shouldn't...

12:39.519 --> 12:41.086
What are you doing here?

12:41.087 --> 12:44.290
Why do my children
always ask me that?

12:44.357 --> 12:45.658
You're my daughter.

12:45.659 --> 12:47.459
Of course, I'm going
to come to you.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.628
Yeah, but...
And this is safer.

12:49.696 --> 12:52.197
Okay? I-I-I...
I thought you'd be happy.

12:52.265 --> 12:54.033
I am. I'm happy.
I'm happy.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.601
I'm just...
I'm surprised.

12:55.602 --> 12:56.669
In a good way.

12:56.670 --> 12:57.736
Oh.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.637
Good.

13:01.608 --> 13:03.275
Shaw was a part
of our team for months.

13:03.276 --> 13:05.044
He knows everything-
all of our weaknesses-

13:05.045 --> 13:06.312
including this place.

13:06.313 --> 13:07.613
I'm worried he's going
to come after Ellie.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.214
We don't know what
he wants. Exactly.

13:09.215 --> 13:10.616
Which is why I
need your help.

13:10.617 --> 13:14.787
I need you to look after her
for me, make sure she's okay.

13:14.854 --> 13:16.755
Until we know
what Shaw wants,

13:16.823 --> 13:18.924
Ellie Bartowski
has a second shadow.

13:18.992 --> 13:20.326
<i>STEVE
No.</i>

13:20.327 --> 13:22.528
No, you were five,
and-and-and you refused

13:22.595 --> 13:25.764
to get out of the car for school
unless you were wearing

13:25.832 --> 13:27.933
the Hawkman costume
that Ellie made.

13:28.001 --> 13:29.468
It's true.

13:29.469 --> 13:31.337
I think... I think I still have

13:31.338 --> 13:33.072
that Thanagarian helmet,
actually.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.574
Dad, how do you
even remember that?

13:35.642 --> 13:38.310
I... you know, I remember
a lot of things.

13:38.378 --> 13:40.278
Uh...

13:41.214 --> 13:43.215
So, what do you guys want
to do tonight?

13:43.283 --> 13:44.917
Oh, actually, you know
what, I've got a...

13:44.918 --> 13:46.352
kind of a date night with Sarah.

13:46.353 --> 13:47.786
We're going to be staying
downtown tonight.

13:47.787 --> 13:49.788
Sorry- it was kind of
a last minute thing, so...

13:49.856 --> 13:51.724
Well, uh, it'll just be
you and me, then.

13:51.725 --> 13:53.158
It'll be great.

13:53.159 --> 13:55.294
We can talk about whatever it
is you wanted to talk about.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.634
Oh, no. You know what?

14:02.702 --> 14:04.269
This is, uh...
this is the hospital.

14:04.270 --> 14:05.671
I... I got to go.

14:05.672 --> 14:07.906
I'm still tying up loose ends
from that Africa trip.

14:07.974 --> 14:09.241
You went to Africa?

14:09.242 --> 14:11.110
Yeah. It's...
it's such a long story.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.578
I'll-I'll be back soon, okay?

14:12.579 --> 14:14.479
Stay here.

14:19.853 --> 14:22.121
Justin, thank God you called.

14:22.188 --> 14:24.056
My dad, he just surprised me.

14:24.057 --> 14:25.758
He's here.
In Echo Park?

14:25.759 --> 14:27.626
I thought you
were getting his address.

14:27.627 --> 14:29.595
He just showed up. What do I do?

14:31.631 --> 14:33.232
John Casey's home.

14:33.233 --> 14:34.733
Okay. It's going to be fine.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.168
Meet me
at Bellevue Square alone,

14:36.169 --> 14:38.437
and we'll figure out what to do
about your dad.

14:38.505 --> 14:40.439
Okay.

14:45.178 --> 14:48.247
So, this last-minute trip
with Sarah-

14:48.314 --> 14:51.750
you're not going on some sort
of a mission, are you?

14:51.818 --> 14:54.219
Dad, we just had a
really nice meal, okay?

14:54.287 --> 14:56.455
What's with all
the spy questions?

14:56.523 --> 14:59.057
Because I don't know anything
about your life,

14:59.125 --> 15:00.993
and I'm here,

15:00.994 --> 15:04.196
and I-I'm trying to figure out
what I missed,

15:05.698 --> 15:07.299
I see one thing.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.468
Casey works at the Buy More.

15:09.536 --> 15:11.737
Sarah lives with you, and...

15:11.805 --> 15:14.740
this is an active
surveillance wire.

15:14.808 --> 15:16.141
Okay?

15:16.142 --> 15:20.412
And your computer
is still tapped in

15:20.480 --> 15:23.215
to the CIA mainframe.

15:23.283 --> 15:24.516
So, you tell me
again, Charles,

15:24.517 --> 15:25.984
that you're not involved
in anything dangerous,

15:25.985 --> 15:28.520
that you're...
that you're not a spy.

15:34.894 --> 15:37.896
Okay, I will occasionally
do some analysis work

15:37.964 --> 15:39.864
for the CIA.
It's a desk job.

15:39.866 --> 15:41.800
It's a glorified
paper pusher. Charles.

15:41.868 --> 15:43.535
Dad, I sit behina desk,
and I input data

15:43.536 --> 15:45.070
a couple of times a month.
It's nothing dangerous.

15:45.071 --> 15:47.473
And this... this thing tonight
with Sarah?

15:47.540 --> 15:49.308
Is really just a night away
with my girlfriend.

15:49.309 --> 15:51.209
You have nothing
to worry about, Dad.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.513
I'm just an analyst.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.525
Did your ears just pop?

16:23.743 --> 16:25.777
Hey, it's me.

16:25.845 --> 16:27.745
Uh, I'm here and you're not.

16:27.747 --> 16:29.414
I really need to see you.

16:29.415 --> 16:31.250
Devon thinks
that I'm at the hospital.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.485
It's just... it's getting harder
and harder to lie.

16:33.553 --> 16:36.054
Please call me, okay?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.334
So, this is Shaw's
penthouse, huh?

16:49.402 --> 16:51.302
Yep.

16:51.337 --> 16:53.338
Great. I'll check over here.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.818
I found the safe.

17:11.257 --> 17:12.523
Where's the safe?

17:12.525 --> 17:14.425
Put these on.

17:15.261 --> 17:17.161
Hey.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.366
How do... how do you...
how do you get to it?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.107
Oh, it's password-protected.

17:29.108 --> 17:30.943
We're going
to be here a while.

17:30.944 --> 17:32.477
Well, maybe we start
with something common.

17:32.478 --> 17:35.280
You know, birthday,
pet's name... your name.

17:39.519 --> 17:41.419
It's Shaw.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.502
Go, go, go, go!

19:04.794 --> 19:05.961
Wait, wait,
wait, wait! No.

19:05.962 --> 19:07.462
We need to know what
Shaw wants first.

19:07.463 --> 19:09.197
Okay? You get the briefcase;
I'll make the jump.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.098
Okay. Well, just be careful.

19:13.002 --> 19:14.503
Okay. Come on, Intersect.

19:14.504 --> 19:16.638
What do you got for me?

19:22.011 --> 19:24.012
This should be interesting.

19:38.027 --> 19:39.927
Shaw.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.267
Shaw is dead.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.569
Care to join him?

19:51.007 --> 19:52.907
Did you get him?
Did you get him?

19:52.909 --> 19:55.477
If you... if you did,
make sure and check his pulse.

19:55.545 --> 19:57.846
But help me first. Okay,
hold on. I'm coming, Chuck.

19:57.914 --> 19:59.814
Help me first before you
check his pulse. Help me.

20:00.883 --> 20:03.351
Sarah, he's coming back.
He's coming back.

20:06.689 --> 20:07.956
Dad.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.857
Just an analyst, huh?

20:15.031 --> 20:17.465
So, this is my office.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.200
Pretty...
pretty sleek, huh?

20:19.201 --> 20:21.269
Why weren't you here,

20:21.337 --> 20:23.471
sitting at one of
these computers

20:23.539 --> 20:25.073
instead of dangling
from a rooftop?

20:25.074 --> 20:26.508
Why are you still
lying to me?

20:26.509 --> 20:28.176
Dad, it's like...
it's like I told you.

20:28.177 --> 20:30.378
The government sees a lot
of potential in me, you know,

20:30.446 --> 20:32.080
so General Beckman asked
if I would work

20:32.081 --> 20:34.382
as an analyst for the CIA,
and then every once in a while,

20:34.450 --> 20:36.217
I'll still go off on,
you know,

20:36.218 --> 20:38.118
a little field mission.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.788
Could you excuse me
just for one second?

20:39.789 --> 20:41.423
And please don't touch
any of the computers.

20:41.424 --> 20:43.925
'Cause I know you want to,
but don't do that.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.361
So, the guy on the roof-
who was he?

20:47.396 --> 20:49.331
Couldn't get a good
look at our mystery man

20:49.398 --> 20:51.132
from the building's
security cam footage.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.901
How'd he know about the loft?

20:52.902 --> 20:55.003
Best guess: when you
accessed the penthouse,

20:55.071 --> 20:56.738
you triggered some
sort of alert.

20:56.739 --> 20:58.473
He was after this.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.308
Lockbox.
Just like the one

21:00.309 --> 21:01.476
Evelyn Shaw had.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.178
Okay, well,
why does Shaw have one?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.613
It's essentially a spy's

21:04.614 --> 21:06.081
last will and testament.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.415
All spies keep a record

21:07.416 --> 21:08.450
of the information
they might lose

21:08.451 --> 21:09.651
if they get killed
on a mission.

21:09.652 --> 21:11.186
In Shaw's case,
all the information

21:11.187 --> 21:13.087
that the CIA has on the Ring.

21:13.089 --> 21:14.989
My bet is they're going
to want this back.

21:14.991 --> 21:16.491
100 bucks says he's
working for them.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.526
And if the Ring
is looking for this,

21:18.594 --> 21:20.729
then it must mean
that Shaw is dead.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.835
"My name is Daniel Shaw,

21:26.836 --> 21:29.871
and if you are reading this,
it means I'm already dead."

21:29.939 --> 21:31.806
I was wrong.

21:31.807 --> 21:33.707
Wrong about what?

21:35.244 --> 21:37.712
I've heard the name,
Daniel Shaw, before.

21:37.780 --> 21:40.048
He... he's a special agent

21:40.116 --> 21:42.884
for the CIA-
a Ring expert.

21:42.952 --> 21:44.452
I take it that's his lockbox.

21:44.453 --> 21:45.620
What happened?

21:45.621 --> 21:46.788
That mission's over, Dad.

21:46.789 --> 21:48.390
No, it's never over.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.392
There will always be another one
and another and...

21:50.459 --> 21:52.927
The reason a spy
has to have one of those

21:52.995 --> 21:55.230
is because any mission
they go on could be their last.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.432
For every spy, there's
someone who cares about them.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.401
Someone who has
to open that box,

21:59.468 --> 22:01.336
read that message,
and mourn their loss.

22:01.337 --> 22:03.905
This is a bad business.

22:03.973 --> 22:06.608
And I don't want my
family any part of it.

22:15.017 --> 22:16.917
Sorry I didn't make it
to the square.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.753
It's fine. Are you okay?
What happened?

22:18.754 --> 22:20.321
I wish I could
tell you,

22:20.322 --> 22:22.957
but the most pressing issue
is what to do about your father.

22:23.025 --> 22:26.261
Do what? John Casey's
watching us like a hawk.

22:26.328 --> 22:27.796
That's why
we've devised a new plan,

22:27.797 --> 22:30.298
but it's going to require
some real spy work on your part.

22:30.366 --> 22:32.367
You up for it?

22:41.156 --> 22:43.824
âª My name is Jeff, uh, Jeff,
Jeff âª

22:43.892 --> 22:46.127
âª That's right, I said
my name is Jeff, uh, Jeff âª

22:46.194 --> 22:48.162
âª Uh, Jeff... âª

22:48.230 --> 22:50.397
That's good, son,
but it might be a little...

22:50.465 --> 22:51.932
lyrically lacking.

22:51.933 --> 22:54.969
JEFF
âª Hey, girl âª

22:55.036 --> 22:57.204
âª Whatcha got for me? âª

22:57.272 --> 23:00.107
âª You want to get up on here
and have a baby wit' me? âª

23:00.175 --> 23:02.075
âª Yeah âª

23:02.110 --> 23:04.078
âª Oh, I see how it is âª

23:04.146 --> 23:06.046
âª Well, I don't need ya âª

23:06.081 --> 23:09.683
âª Your uterus won't fit my baby
in it anyway âª

23:09.751 --> 23:12.086
âª My name is Jeff,
uh, Jeff, uh, Jeff âª

23:12.154 --> 23:13.587
âª I'm the baddest man... âª

23:13.588 --> 23:15.488
Hey, have you
seen Grimes?

23:16.124 --> 23:17.558
Lost your friend, did you?

23:17.559 --> 23:19.160
Can't find him
'cause he's changed so much?

23:19.161 --> 23:20.528
But you can't help

23:20.529 --> 23:21.996
but think about the days you
guys used to drink together

23:21.997 --> 23:23.497
and hold each other
for hours and hours,

23:23.498 --> 23:25.099
just talking about
even the silliest little things.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.667
âª Lift up your frown âª

23:26.668 --> 23:28.302
Those days are no more.

23:28.303 --> 23:30.203
They're no...
âª My name is Jeff âª

23:30.238 --> 23:32.540
âª Uh, Jeff, uh, Jeff... âª

23:32.607 --> 23:35.109
Don't you knock?

23:35.177 --> 23:37.311
Shaw is alive, okay.

23:37.379 --> 23:38.879
And he's bringing a reckoning
with him.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.714
Ah. No one told you, huh?

23:40.715 --> 23:42.216
Shaw's dead.

23:42.217 --> 23:44.985
No. No. Chuck said.
He... Bartowski's wrong.

23:45.053 --> 23:46.253
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

23:46.254 --> 23:47.955
Man, someone could have given me
a heads-up here.

23:47.956 --> 23:49.690
I've had to pee
for, like, the last four hours.

23:49.691 --> 23:51.258
But I'm not here for that.

23:51.259 --> 23:53.761
Listen, would Ellie cheat
on Devon for any reason?

23:53.828 --> 23:55.763
John Casey, if I had the
height or the willpower,

23:55.830 --> 23:57.731
I would slap you across
the face right now, okay?

23:57.799 --> 23:58.999
No, Ellie is
not a cheater.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.401
The only way
she'd ever step out

24:00.402 --> 24:01.936
was with someone
that she's known her whole life,

24:01.937 --> 24:03.537
someone she trusts.

24:03.538 --> 24:05.172
A childhood friend perhaps.
I don't know.

24:05.173 --> 24:06.740
Mm-hmm. I tapped into her phone.

24:06.741 --> 24:07.975
She left this strange message.

24:07.976 --> 24:09.710
I really need to see you.

24:09.711 --> 24:11.445
Devon thinks
that I'm at the hospital.

24:11.446 --> 24:14.215
It's just... it's getting harder
and harder to lie.

24:14.282 --> 24:15.382
That's Ellie.

24:15.383 --> 24:17.151
Oh...

24:17.152 --> 24:18.419
Oh, man.

24:18.420 --> 24:19.687
So what's the deal?

24:19.688 --> 24:21.222
You've done well, John,

24:21.223 --> 24:23.757
but you're a man who lacks tact
and interpersonal skill.

24:23.825 --> 24:25.392
Okay, on behalf
of the family,

24:25.393 --> 24:27.928
I'll speak to the
husband, all right?

24:27.996 --> 24:29.896
This is not gonna be fun.

24:31.266 --> 24:33.701
Devon, yeah, so you think
Ellie's happy in your marriage?

24:33.768 --> 24:35.035
Of course.

24:35.036 --> 24:37.338
Why? Did she
say something?

24:37.405 --> 24:39.573
No. No, not exactly,
but I feel pretty confident

24:39.641 --> 24:41.809
that if there is something
wrong, it's your fault.

24:41.876 --> 24:44.812
So, take me through
an average day, and then,

24:44.879 --> 24:46.680
you talk, I find the problem.

24:46.681 --> 24:48.581
Okay.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.284
Well, most mornings,
I wake up around 6:00,

24:50.285 --> 24:51.652
I pop a towel in the dryer

24:51.653 --> 24:53.454
so it's warm when she
gets out of the shower.

24:53.455 --> 24:55.556
I'll whip her up a
Belgian waffle, or,

24:55.624 --> 24:57.258
you know, goat cheese omelet.

24:57.259 --> 24:59.159
Something easy.

24:59.594 --> 25:01.061
After Ellie's
daily foot rub,

25:01.062 --> 25:02.696
I'll bike to the
farmer's market,

25:02.697 --> 25:03.931
pick up some fresh blueberries,

25:03.932 --> 25:05.532
or you know,
whatever's in season.

25:05.533 --> 25:07.234
Come home, make
her a smoothie.

25:07.235 --> 25:08.636
Organic nonfat milk,

25:08.637 --> 25:10.004
flaxseed oil.

25:10.005 --> 25:11.905
You know, something to give her
a real midday kick start.

25:13.308 --> 25:14.575
Once we're in bed,

25:14.576 --> 25:17.511
post-lavender bath,

25:17.579 --> 25:20.214
I spend about 20 minutes
just watching her sleep.

25:20.282 --> 25:22.349
She looks so
peaceful.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.317
It's, like, what's she dreaming
about, you know?

25:25.887 --> 25:27.721
Anyway, that's my day,
give or take.

25:27.722 --> 25:29.622
Yeah.

25:31.826 --> 25:33.861
Hey, Dad.

25:35.797 --> 25:37.898
Is everything okay?

25:37.966 --> 25:40.000
I- I just keep thinking.

25:42.103 --> 25:44.104
Without the Intersect...

25:45.740 --> 25:47.608
...why would they let you go
on missions?

25:47.609 --> 25:49.310
I mean,

25:49.311 --> 25:52.179
you're-you're...
you're an ordinary guy.

25:52.247 --> 25:53.981
I'm not.

25:53.982 --> 25:55.716
I'm not an ordinary guy.

25:55.717 --> 25:57.751
The CIA wants me
to work for them

25:57.819 --> 25:59.719
because they think I'm special.

26:02.657 --> 26:03.891
'Cause they believe in me.

26:03.892 --> 26:05.759
You're right, Charles.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.660
You are special.

26:11.766 --> 26:13.666
I knew it.

26:13.668 --> 26:16.136
You downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

26:16.204 --> 26:18.105
You threw a knife at my face.

26:18.173 --> 26:19.340
Why would you do that?

26:19.341 --> 26:21.141
After I worked so hard
to get the first one out.

26:21.142 --> 26:23.777
Dad, knife! Face!

26:23.845 --> 26:25.212
What if you
were wrong?

26:25.213 --> 26:27.181
I'm never wrong.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.085
Charles,

26:31.086 --> 26:34.288
there's something
that I never told you.

26:34.356 --> 26:36.323
The Intersect-

26:36.391 --> 26:38.692
it can have a negative effect
on the brain.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.094
Hold-Hold... Hold on.

26:40.095 --> 26:41.962
What? You... you knew?

26:41.963 --> 26:43.797
You-you knew,
and you didn't tell me?!

26:43.798 --> 26:45.232
I didn't think
I had to tell you.

26:45.233 --> 26:46.867
You didn't tell me
you downloaded the new one!

26:46.868 --> 26:49.002
But that's because I knew
you would disapprove of it.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.637
<i>And-and... you know what?
And you left.</i>

26:50.638 --> 26:52.573
Again.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.975
You taught me and Ellie
how to live life without you,

26:55.043 --> 26:56.943
and that's exactly
what I'm doing.

27:03.551 --> 27:06.086
I... I have to go.

27:06.154 --> 27:07.721
Right now.

27:07.722 --> 27:09.356
What?

27:09.357 --> 27:11.492
Wait. Wait. Dad. Dad,
where-where are you going?

27:11.559 --> 27:13.026
I'm sorry.

27:13.027 --> 27:15.629
I can't stay here
and watch my son die.

27:20.635 --> 27:23.537
Dad?

27:23.538 --> 27:24.905
You're-you're leaving?

27:24.906 --> 27:26.373
Weren't you going
to say good-bye?

27:26.374 --> 27:27.708
Oh. Sorry. I'm, uh...

27:27.709 --> 27:30.043
I still don't even know
what's wrong,

27:30.111 --> 27:31.745
why you wanted me here.

27:31.746 --> 27:33.881
Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Dad.

27:33.948 --> 27:35.149
Oh.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.784
I just, uh... I missed you,

27:36.785 --> 27:38.585
and I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

27:38.586 --> 27:40.486
Oh, okay.

27:40.488 --> 27:43.424
Well, you-you don't have
to worry about-about me,

27:43.491 --> 27:44.658
uh, Eleanor.

27:44.659 --> 27:45.826
Um,

27:45.827 --> 27:47.060
this time,

27:47.061 --> 27:48.961
I won't be gone as long,
I promise.

27:48.997 --> 27:50.897
Okay.
Okay.

27:50.899 --> 27:53.333
Take care of yourself?

28:06.080 --> 28:07.980
I did it.

28:08.416 --> 28:09.616
I planted the tracer.

28:09.617 --> 28:11.385
Nice work, Ellie.

28:11.386 --> 28:14.188
You've guaranteed
your father's protection.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.587
Where's your dad?

28:42.654 --> 28:45.389
He found out I was
the Intersect, and he left.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.725
<i>Chuck, he must have had
a good reason.</i>

28:47.793 --> 28:49.393
<i>He loves you.</i>

28:49.394 --> 28:51.162
I know. I-I...

28:51.163 --> 28:52.930
I know that he loves me.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.232
He just doesn't know me.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.133
He doesn't know anything
about me.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.936
<i>Why I became the Intersect,</i>

28:59.004 --> 29:00.705
<i>that-that...
that I can help people.</i>

29:00.706 --> 29:02.673
<i>That for the first time
in my life,</i>

29:02.741 --> 29:04.742
<i>what I do actually
means something.</i>

29:06.178 --> 29:07.211
Did you tell him that?

29:07.212 --> 29:09.280
No.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.815
<i>I guess I didn't.</i>

29:10.816 --> 29:12.516
<i>But I can't talk to him now</i>

29:12.517 --> 29:15.319
because he's gone,
and I don't know where he lives.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.287
I do.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.092
It's gonna work.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.261
In the event
that your dad ran off,

29:23.328 --> 29:26.464
I wanted you to be able
to find him, so...

29:26.531 --> 29:28.532
I took this.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.207
<i>Your misdemeanor aside,</i>

29:36.275 --> 29:39.043
<i>my dad is an incredibly
paranoid person,</i>

29:39.111 --> 29:41.545
and I'm sure that this isn't
his real address. Oh, I know.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.481
But it was issued
by the Bishop County DMV,

29:43.482 --> 29:44.949
and I checked all
the utilities databases,

29:44.950 --> 29:46.217
and this is the only house

29:46.218 --> 29:47.785
without cable,
water and gas,

29:47.786 --> 29:51.022
<i>but also consumes an incredible
amount of electricity, so,</i>

29:51.089 --> 29:52.790
I'm pretty sure
that's your dad's house.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.225
<i>Wow. That's so...</i>

29:54.226 --> 29:56.227
<i>Spyish?</i>

29:56.295 --> 29:57.795
<i>Well,</i>

29:57.796 --> 30:00.164
I am a spy.

30:06.905 --> 30:09.407
Yeah. We're at the house.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.909
Good. Don't call me again
until you have it.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.639
Well, this must be it.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.610
I'm just gonna go in there
and tell him how I feel.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.845
Do you want me
to come with you?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.247
No, it's okay.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.117
But if I'm not back
in 20 minutes, you come save me.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.186
Okay.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.060
Where is it?

31:03.128 --> 31:04.695
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.996
Yes, you do.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.866
My employer knows that
you have an Intersect.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.469
Where's the thing
that's keeping you alive?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.939
Dad, it's me.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.941
Don't worry.
I'm alone.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.257
Cut it. We'll make this
look like an accident.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.495
Oh, that. Oh, that.
That-that's not safe.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.163
That's not safe.
He shouldn't be doing that.

31:39.164 --> 31:40.331
Mr. Bartowski,

31:40.332 --> 31:42.233
this will all be
a lot less painful

31:42.300 --> 31:44.335
if you tell me
where the Governor is.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.237
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.572
Not you. Your father.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.007
Aha.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.142
What is he
talking about?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.810
The Governor!

31:52.811 --> 31:54.011
Oh.

31:54.012 --> 31:56.147
It's the watch, isn't it?

31:56.214 --> 31:59.784
No.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.419
Tie them up.
Dad.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.520
And let's clear out.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.221
We don't want to be here

32:04.222 --> 32:05.222
when this place goes up.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.257
Sorry about this.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.359
You shouldn't
have come here.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.461
I didn't want to drag you
into anything.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.429
Dad... Dad I came up.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.265
I came up here because I wanted

32:14.266 --> 32:16.166
to tell you why
I downloaded the Intersect,

32:16.168 --> 32:18.068
that I'm... that I'm special,
and that I can help people.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.236
But given the circumstances,

32:19.237 --> 32:21.405
I think
I'm just gonna have to show you.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.351
No guns!
The gas!

32:34.352 --> 32:36.252
That's a good idea.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.630
Does she have
the Intersect, too?

33:21.566 --> 33:23.601
No, Dad.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.804
That's all her.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.772
Hi, honey.

33:34.872 --> 33:37.340
Hey, come in.

33:37.408 --> 33:40.977
I don't know
how the Ring found my cabin.

33:42.780 --> 33:46.516
But I do know what they...
what they came for.

33:54.225 --> 33:55.625
I call it the Governor

33:55.626 --> 33:59.262
'cause it sort of
governs the Intersect.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.331
See, I realized
through the years that...

34:01.398 --> 34:02.565
that, just like a computer,

34:02.566 --> 34:05.068
that th-the,
the Intersect can overheat.

34:05.135 --> 34:06.569
Is that what's happening to me?

34:06.570 --> 34:08.771
Yeah, see,
your brain is like a circuit,

34:08.839 --> 34:12.775
and when you flash, it releases
a surge of electrical energy,

34:12.842 --> 34:14.844
but if it's not controlled,
it can lead to dementia

34:14.911 --> 34:18.081
a- a-and insanity,
maybe even death,

34:18.148 --> 34:19.482
but I've been working on a fix

34:19.483 --> 34:21.382
a- and this is the closest

34:21.385 --> 34:24.687
that I've gotten to one.

34:24.755 --> 34:28.157
See, i-it, um, it governs
my neural network

34:28.225 --> 34:31.159
and helps control the
power of the Intersect,

34:31.228 --> 34:33.029
almost like a, uh,

34:33.030 --> 34:34.929
like a pacemaker would
for the heart.

34:34.931 --> 34:37.766
Could something like that
work for the 2.0?

34:37.835 --> 34:39.636
Well, I couldn't tell you
about it until now

34:39.637 --> 34:42.170
'cause I needed to go back
to my cabin to be sure,

34:42.239 --> 34:45.440
but, Charles, i-it will.

34:46.810 --> 34:48.710
I'm gonna make you one.

34:50.514 --> 34:52.447
You're my son,

34:52.516 --> 34:56.518
and you downloaded the 2.0

34:56.587 --> 35:00.123
for the same reason I created
the original: to help people.

35:00.190 --> 35:02.492
You want to be a spy.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.094
I'm gonna do
everything I can to...

35:05.162 --> 35:07.163
help you be the man
you want to be.

35:08.198 --> 35:10.166
Thanks.

35:11.201 --> 35:13.936
Thank you.

35:19.410 --> 35:23.746
Lester, I want to help you be
the man you ought to be.

35:23.814 --> 35:26.282
It's too late.

35:26.350 --> 35:29.185
Jeff will be huge here,
then he'll be huge in Japan,

35:29.253 --> 35:30.586
and then it's over.

35:30.587 --> 35:31.754
Boy, don't you see?

35:31.755 --> 35:34.390
The man made a banner
that said "Jef"

35:34.458 --> 35:36.492
as if it were a question.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.494
He doesn't know
who he is without you.

35:38.562 --> 35:40.697
You're more than just
the 'ster in Jeffster!

35:40.764 --> 35:43.833
You're the 'ster
that stirs the drink.

35:43.901 --> 35:46.102
I won't be fooled
by corporate trickery.

35:46.170 --> 35:48.538
I will never bow down
to the man.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.505
I'm not the man.

35:50.541 --> 35:52.809
I'm a man...

35:52.876 --> 35:55.878
a man who once had
a dream, too.

35:57.381 --> 35:58.915
You ever heard
of Earth, Wind & Fire?

35:58.916 --> 36:00.416
Yeah, they jammed.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.353
For a short time in 1988,

36:03.420 --> 36:06.723
we were called
Earth, Wind, Fire & Rain.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.426
I was Rain.

36:10.427 --> 36:13.162
âª Do you remember âª

36:13.230 --> 36:16.032
âª The 21st night of September? âª
My God.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.600
âª Love was changing the minds
of pretenders âª

36:17.601 --> 36:19.569
I can't wear this anymore,

36:19.636 --> 36:21.738
but you have the hips
of a six-year-old girl.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.706
Use them.

36:25.209 --> 36:27.877
âª Ah, ah, ba, de, ya âª

36:27.945 --> 36:30.313
âª Say, do you remember? âª

36:30.381 --> 36:32.348
Where do I sign?

36:32.416 --> 36:34.317
âª Dancing in September... âª

36:34.385 --> 36:35.685
Just depends
on your HD hookup...

36:35.686 --> 36:36.686
Excuse me, guys.

36:36.687 --> 36:38.788
Can I speak to you
for a second, please?

36:38.856 --> 36:39.889
Excuse me.

36:39.890 --> 36:40.890
Yeah.

36:40.891 --> 36:42.291
I talked
to Captain Awesome.

36:42.292 --> 36:43.292
And?

36:43.293 --> 36:46.596
If he'd have me,
I'd let him.

36:46.663 --> 36:47.764
Look, what I'm saying is:

36:47.765 --> 36:49.632
as much as it pains me
to say it,

36:49.633 --> 36:52.101
if there's a problem here,
it's on Ellie's side.

36:52.169 --> 36:53.269
Hey, look,
let me ask you something:

36:53.270 --> 36:54.737
why are you even doing this?

36:54.738 --> 36:58.074
I gave Chuck my word I'd make
sure his sister was okay.

37:01.111 --> 37:02.278
You know what?

37:02.279 --> 37:03.713
Awesome is volunteering
at the animal shelter,

37:03.714 --> 37:04.947
Ellie is working
the late shift.

37:04.948 --> 37:06.848
The apartment should be
completely empty.

37:06.850 --> 37:07.850
Perfect.

37:07.851 --> 37:10.420
<i>I'm gonna go take a look.</i>

37:39.183 --> 37:40.583
JUSTIN Ellie, are
you with your husband?

37:40.584 --> 37:42.185
No, my husband's not home.

37:42.186 --> 37:43.986
Everybody thinks
that I'm working.

37:43.987 --> 37:45.288
Okay, do you expect them back

37:45.289 --> 37:46.422
anytime soon?

37:46.423 --> 37:47.623
No, it's safe.

37:47.624 --> 37:48.925
You're sure?

37:48.926 --> 37:50.059
Yeah, you can come here.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.294
Good, I'm already on my way.

37:51.295 --> 37:53.195
Oh, okay, good.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.400
There's someone in the house.

37:57.468 --> 37:58.701
How close are you?

37:58.702 --> 38:00.870
I'm close,
but I may not get there in time.

38:00.938 --> 38:03.005
Go to the speaker.

38:05.209 --> 38:06.576
Okay.

38:06.577 --> 38:07.577
Now open it.

38:07.578 --> 38:08.878
How?

38:08.879 --> 38:11.714
Press all three buttons at once
and wait for a click.

38:20.691 --> 38:22.425
Justin, no, I can't, I can't.

38:22.426 --> 38:23.759
Someone's in your house, Ellie.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.628
He could hurt you,
hurt your family.

38:25.629 --> 38:28.264
Now take the gun.

38:57.895 --> 38:59.795
Ellie, wait!

39:04.301 --> 39:06.235
Justin,

39:06.303 --> 39:08.070
Justin, John Casey...
Don't worry,

39:08.071 --> 39:10.873
you're safe, come with me.

39:15.612 --> 39:17.613
Hey.

39:21.752 --> 39:23.652
What's wrong?

39:27.157 --> 39:30.092
I've been thinking about what
happened at the cabin and...

39:30.160 --> 39:33.596
how you almost died.

39:33.664 --> 39:35.164
You know, everything
that your dad said

39:35.165 --> 39:36.799
about the life
that we've chosen-

39:36.800 --> 39:38.601
he's right.

39:38.602 --> 39:40.636
What we do
is not safe.

39:42.639 --> 39:44.740
I want you to have this.

39:46.310 --> 39:48.477
My spy will.

39:50.614 --> 39:52.548
Why are you giving me this?

39:52.616 --> 39:54.550
Chuck, this is me.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.085
It's everything I
know, it's my life,

39:56.086 --> 39:58.921
and if something were
to happen to me...

40:00.958 --> 40:04.393
Well, if anyone's going to
have it, I want it to be you.

40:04.461 --> 40:07.263
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

40:07.331 --> 40:09.231
You're not going
anywhere.

40:11.134 --> 40:13.636
And neither am I.

40:26.149 --> 40:28.084
You'll be safe here
until we figure out

40:28.151 --> 40:29.619
what to do about
John Casey.

40:29.620 --> 40:32.555
I'm so sorry, I just...
I couldn't, I couldn't...

40:32.623 --> 40:34.056
Is my dad going
to be okay?

40:34.057 --> 40:35.524
Don't worry, he's protected.
What about my husband, though?

40:35.525 --> 40:37.059
What about my brother?

40:37.060 --> 40:38.828
They're fine, I promise.

40:38.829 --> 40:40.696
You've done everything
we've asked, Ellie.

40:40.697 --> 40:41.964
You've been
incredibly brave,

40:41.965 --> 40:44.300
and trust me, this
is almost over.

40:44.368 --> 40:45.901
Now wait here.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.070
I'll be back soon.

41:05.856 --> 41:08.157
<i>"My name is Chuck Bartowski,</i>

41:08.225 --> 41:10.660
<i>"and if you're reading this,
it means I'm already dead.</i>

41:10.727 --> 41:13.529
<i>I don't know
what will end up killing me..."</i>

41:15.465 --> 41:16.899
<i>"...but I've chosen
to be a spy,</i>

41:16.900 --> 41:19.235
<i>"and there are consequences
to that.</i>

41:23.106 --> 41:25.541
<i>"It may be my emotions

41:27.678 --> 41:30.680
<i>"...or a slip-up, trying

41:32.182 --> 41:34.417
<i>"...or my family..."</i>

41:36.319 --> 41:38.688
<i>"...who never wanted me
to be a part of this."</i>

41:41.725 --> 41:43.659
My team was captured.

41:43.727 --> 41:46.095
This needs to happen now-
no more waiting.

42:09.886 --> 42:12.922
<i>"Or it could be
the thing I never saw coming,</i>

42:12.989 --> 42:14.990
<i>but I know it's coming."</i>
