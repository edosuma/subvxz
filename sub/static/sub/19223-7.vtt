Crap.

18:54.746 --> 18:57.109
[lively music]

18:57.175 --> 18:58.654
It's really great to see you,
Hannah.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.474
I'm so glad
I figured out that snafu

19:00.505 --> 19:03.068
where my phone was dropping
calls and couldn't send texts.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.232
I'm assuming you fixed it
by switching it off B.S. mode?

19:06.451 --> 19:07.826
You're lucky you're cute.

19:07.904 --> 19:08.933
[gasps]

Whoa!

19:16.761 --> 19:18.706
Ow!
[groans]

19:18.763 --> 19:20.514
Oh, I just peed a little.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.543
I believe this is yours.

19:22.826 --> 19:25.100
Oh, hey, you're the guy
from the balcony.

19:25.157 --> 19:26.248
[giggles]

19:27.006 --> 19:28.647
You guys out on a date?

19:28.764 --> 19:30.218
No.

19:30.993 --> 19:32.370
You look great.

19:32.777 --> 19:34.271
It kinda looks like
you're out on a date.

[quirky music]

19:36.326 --> 19:38.600
- Hey.
- Cool.

19:46.514 --> 19:48.169
Hey, boss.

19:48.686 --> 19:50.197
How we feeling?

19:50.436 --> 19:53.014
You were right.
There is an "I" in "failure"

19:53.061 --> 19:54.307
and it's I.

19:54.607 --> 19:57.068
Me.
Uh... me... my... I don't...

19:57.115 --> 19:59.076
I can't even grammar properly!

19:59.155 --> 20:00.522
It's all a lie!

20:00.654 --> 20:03.818
Was I actually prom king
and did my date really like me

20:03.881 --> 20:07.397
or was she just another
flunky on the Wayne payroll?

20:08.865 --> 20:12.287
Oh, well, she seems...
nice.

20:12.834 --> 20:15.240
- Who is this Fella?
- Oh, that's her uncle,

20:15.303 --> 20:17.623
Silky Valentine.
He was our chaperone.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.326
Oh, my God.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.202
She was a who...

20:21.841 --> 20:23.412
No one has ever loved me!

20:23.459 --> 20:24.897
Okay, that's not true.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.849
Your parents put an obscene
amount of time and effort

20:27.912 --> 20:31.022
into making sure you never
experienced even one moment

20:31.053 --> 20:32.381
of disappointment.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.615
They must've really cared
about you.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.288
You know, you haven't lost
at everything.

20:37.396 --> 20:39.451
You did beat me at
the Green Arrow game

20:39.654 --> 20:41.193
all by yourself.

20:41.303 --> 20:43.287
That's right... I did.

20:43.389 --> 20:44.811
See?
There you go.

20:44.897 --> 20:46.272
I destroyed you!

20:46.311 --> 20:48.178
- It was very close.
- Eh.

20:48.295 --> 20:51.709
[sighs] Look, we don't need
to be squaring off like this.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.045
We are on the same team,
and if we both refuse to lose,

20:55.115 --> 20:57.654
then we can accomplish
great things.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.943
You're right, I-I don't need
to be threatened

21:00.045 --> 21:02.756
by your wins,
'cause your wins are my wins.

21:02.850 --> 21:06.186
And your losses,
I can just blame on you.

- Emily!

I am back!
[laughs]

21:10.677 --> 21:13.350
Now get out of my office
'cause I'm about to sneeze.
