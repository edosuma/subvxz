00:44.909 --> 00:47.340
<i>We may think ourselves</i>
<i>familiar in this day and age</i>

00:47.475 --> 00:50.007
<i>with the notion that</i>
<i>whores of every description</i>

00:50.143 --> 00:52.634
<i>can very easily</i>
<i>achieve fame and fortune.</i>

00:52.776 --> 00:54.765
<i>But towards the end of the 19th century</i>

00:54.909 --> 00:59.001
<i>in what came to be known in France</i>
<i>as the belle époque,</i>

00:59.143 --> 01:02.939
<i>a select group of courtesans</i>
<i>became, for a short period,</i>

01:03.076 --> 01:08.168
<i>the most celebrated and powerful women</i>
<i>in the long history of prostitution.</i>

01:09.842 --> 01:14.638
<i>There was Émilienne D'Alençon,</i>
<i>who fancied herself as an actress,</i>

01:14.776 --> 01:16.106
<i>but was better known as the woman</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:20.039
<i>who'd all but bankrupted</i>
<i>King Leopold II of Belgium.</i>

01:21.876 --> 01:23.341
<i>There was Liane de Pougy,</i>

01:23.475 --> 01:25.839
<i>who, when shown</i>
<i>a million and a half francs worth of jewels</i>

01:25.976 --> 01:27.532
<i>by her lover of the moment</i>

01:27.676 --> 01:29.699
<i>became paralyzed with indecision.</i>

01:29.842 --> 01:33.138
<i>Thus,</i>
<i>obliging him to buy her the entire display.</i>

01:33.275 --> 01:36.208
<i>She later became a nun.</i>

01:36.609 --> 01:37.973
<i>There was La Belle Otero,</i>

01:38.109 --> 01:40.666
<i>Spanish dancer, provoker of suicides</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:44.003
<i>and lover of at least</i>
<i>six crowned European monarchs,</i>

01:44.143 --> 01:45.802
<i>whose breasts served as models</i>

01:45.943 --> 01:49.875
<i>for the cupolas</i>
<i>on the new Carlton Hotel at Cannes.</i>

01:52.842 --> 01:55.740
<i>And there was Lea de Lonval.</i>

01:55.876 --> 01:57.501
<i>Born Leone Vallon,</i>

01:57.642 --> 02:01.040
<i>envied by many</i>
<i>as the most beautiful of all.</i>

02:01.176 --> 02:02.539
<i>Her good sense had enabled her</i>

02:02.676 --> 02:05.938
<i>to avoid the most dangerous hazard</i>
<i>facing those of her profession,</i>

02:06.076 --> 02:08.735
<i>namely falling in love.</i>

02:10.342 --> 02:12.808
<i>Now, with the departure</i>
<i>of her most recent lover</i>

02:12.943 --> 02:14.499
<i>to his Russian estates,</i>

02:14.642 --> 02:18.972
<i>Lea, aware that she was not far away</i>
<i>from being a certain age</i>

02:19.109 --> 02:23.268
<i>was beginning to entertain the idea</i>
<i>of retiring.</i>

02:23.409 --> 02:26.273
Is there anything in the world
more wonderful

02:26.409 --> 02:30.865
than a bed all to oneself?

02:31.409 --> 02:34.773
- Good night, madame.
- Mm, good night, Rose.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.371
<i>Headquarters of the belle époque</i>

02:41.509 --> 02:42.805
<i>was Maxim's restaurant</i>

02:42.943 --> 02:45.704
<i>whose maître d'</i>
<i>possessed an indispensable notebook</i>

02:45.842 --> 02:49.239
<i>containing a long list of names</i>
<i>of available women.</i>

02:49.375 --> 02:51.171
More Pommery.

02:51.309 --> 02:53.867
Pommery is on its way, Fred.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.308
<i>One of his most regular customers</i>

02:56.442 --> 02:59.136
<i>was Fred Peloux, known as Chéri,</i>

02:59.275 --> 03:04.799
<i>the rich but neglected son</i>
<i>of another celebrated courtesan.</i>

03:09.143 --> 03:13.007
<i>As the only child of a woman</i>
<i>focused obsessively on her career,</i>

03:13.143 --> 03:18.370
<i>Chéri had led a solitary</i>
<i>and often confusing life.</i>

03:18.809 --> 03:20.934
<i>Now, at the age of 19,</i>

03:21.076 --> 03:24.735
<i>truth be told, after several years</i>
<i>of conscientious debauchery,</i>

03:24.876 --> 03:27.899
<i>he was exhausted enough</i>
<i>to be starting himself to think longingly</i>

03:28.043 --> 03:29.906
<i>of the notion of retirement.</i>

03:45.275 --> 03:46.400
<i>Every so often,</i>

03:46.542 --> 03:49.565
<i>Lea de Lonval found it necessary</i>
<i>to rise early</i>

03:49.709 --> 03:53.073
<i>and prepare herself</i>
<i>as if for gladiatorial combat.</i>

03:53.209 --> 03:57.108
Oh, Rose, why did I agree to have lunch
with that dreadful woman

03:57.242 --> 04:00.538
in that hideous mausoleum?

04:04.142 --> 04:07.870
To the Palace of Varieties, Ernest.

04:10.676 --> 04:11.767
<i>Like most women</i>

04:11.909 --> 04:14.466
<i>who have devoted their lives</i>
<i>to various forms of love</i>

04:14.976 --> 04:18.168
<i>and been ostracized from polite society</i>
<i>as a result,</i>

04:18.309 --> 04:24.333
<i>Lea now found herself confined</i>
<i>to an extremely narrow circle of friends.</i>

04:27.609 --> 04:30.769
<i>Today, she was visiting</i>
<i>her former colleague, Charlotte,</i>

04:30.909 --> 04:33.466
<i>once one</i>
<i>of her most ruthless competitors,</i>

04:33.609 --> 04:35.905
<i>a woman of legendary astuteness</i>
<i>and skill</i>

04:36.043 --> 04:39.975
<i>at extracting immense sums</i>
<i>from her clients.</i>

04:40.108 --> 04:41.870
<i>Normally ravenous for gossip,</i>

04:42.009 --> 04:47.236
<i>today Charlotte was preoccupied</i>
<i>with a particular problem of her own.</i>

04:48.275 --> 04:50.503
That child will be the death of me.

04:50.642 --> 04:54.006
- The death of me.
- Charlotte, that child is 19.

04:54.142 --> 04:57.131
Can you remember
what a gorgeous little boy he was?

04:57.275 --> 04:58.707
All those curls.

05:00.043 --> 05:02.235
I expect I remember better than you.

05:02.642 --> 05:04.904
I can't imagine what you mean.

05:05.676 --> 05:08.198
Sometimes I wonder
if it's the same person.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.274
Black circles under his eyes.

05:10.409 --> 05:13.035
Doesn't get up
till the middle of the afternoon.

05:13.175 --> 05:16.664
Never stopped nagging me
until I bought him a new motorcar.

05:17.142 --> 05:20.040
And I used to think of myself
as such a happy mother.

05:20.175 --> 05:22.471
We all have our cross to bear.

05:22.609 --> 05:23.802
To tell you the truth,

05:23.943 --> 05:26.000
I was hoping
you might have a word with him.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.199
I?

05:27.342 --> 05:29.968
He's always thought of you
as a kind of godmother.

05:30.108 --> 05:32.370
He pays no attention to me anymore.

05:32.509 --> 05:34.873
But I'm sure he'll listen
to anything you have to say.

05:37.976 --> 05:40.635
"No more than ten cigarettes a day,"
he said.

05:40.776 --> 05:43.742
And brandy only at the weekend.
He said it was my heart.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.569
So there is one.

05:49.542 --> 05:53.440
- Nounoune.
- Chéri.

05:54.209 --> 05:56.767
What time do you call this
to be making an appearance?

05:56.909 --> 05:59.272
- Oh, my God, who's that?
- Don't start that.

05:59.409 --> 06:02.705
Ah, yes, you're my mother, aren't you?

06:02.842 --> 06:06.433
I vaguely remember meeting you
a few times when I was little.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.098
That's not at all amusing.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.333
I was told you were seen in a bar
last week

06:10.475 --> 06:11.997
sitting on old Lili's knee.

06:12.142 --> 06:14.472
Don't be ridiculous.
Lili hasn't got any knees.

06:14.609 --> 06:16.336
They disappeared years ago.

06:16.475 --> 06:17.566
You see what I mean?

06:17.976 --> 06:19.134
Show me your tongue.

06:21.876 --> 06:23.239
You shouldn't drink gin.

06:25.909 --> 06:28.238
- Or brandy.
- Well, it wouldn't be polite

06:28.375 --> 06:31.136
to let my mother drink alone,
now would it?

06:31.576 --> 06:32.973
You don't look at all well.

06:33.108 --> 06:36.597
You're quite right, Lea.
He's a bag of bones. A bag of bones.

06:36.742 --> 06:38.833
- I feel fine.
- You're a bad color.

06:38.975 --> 06:41.134
Distinctly green about the gills.

06:42.042 --> 06:44.941
I meant to ask you,
my dear, are you free on Sunday?

06:45.075 --> 06:47.303
No, I'm going down
to my house in Normandy tomorrow.

06:47.442 --> 06:49.567
- With Speleieff?
- No, that's over.

06:49.709 --> 06:53.266
Speleieff's gone back to Russia.
Do concentrate.

06:53.409 --> 06:54.636
Your memory, Chéri.

06:54.776 --> 06:57.435
We went to the farewell dinner
a couple of months ago.

06:57.576 --> 06:59.201
Ah, yes. We had langoustine.

06:59.342 --> 07:01.501
I could just do with a plate of them now.

07:01.642 --> 07:06.165
One minute he won't eat,
the next he's asking for langoustine.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.300
Which one are you taking to Normandy
with you?

07:10.642 --> 07:12.232
I'm going on my own.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.737
Nice to be so rich.

07:14.876 --> 07:16.637
You're welcome to come if you like.

07:16.776 --> 07:20.606
There's nothing to do there
but eat, drink and sleep.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.274
Where is this place?

07:27.375 --> 07:30.671
It's just down the coast from Honfleur.

07:34.742 --> 07:37.037
I'm so exhausted all the time.

07:37.175 --> 07:40.266
I said you don't look at all well.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.608
Pfft, pfft, pfft!

07:43.876 --> 07:46.398
Do you good
to spend some time in the country.

07:46.542 --> 07:47.599
Just simple things.

07:47.742 --> 07:50.003
Grilled chicken,
strawberries and cream.

07:50.142 --> 07:51.472
No women.

07:51.609 --> 07:53.734
- No women? Sounds irresistible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:57.075 --> 08:01.098
Has anyone ever explained to you
why your eyes are so beautiful?

08:01.242 --> 08:02.299
No.

08:02.442 --> 08:04.999
It's because they're shaped like a sole.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.334
Like a sole, the fish.

08:09.809 --> 08:13.332
This end, you see, by your nose
is the head of the sole.

08:13.475 --> 08:15.407
And the upper curve is the back.

08:15.542 --> 08:19.030
And the lower line here is the flat belly.

08:19.175 --> 08:20.664
- I see.
- Yes.

08:20.809 --> 08:24.536
If it were curved under the eyes
as well as above it,

08:24.676 --> 08:26.301
it would be shaped like a flounder.

08:26.442 --> 08:27.738
And then you would look stupid.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.308
Well, well,
you learn something every day.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.841
These are heavy.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.601
Yes.

08:42.442 --> 08:43.567
Mm.

08:43.708 --> 08:46.902
Why did I start calling you Nounoune,
can you remember?

08:47.042 --> 08:48.099
I don't know.

08:48.242 --> 08:51.436
You were 6 at the time
and not disposed to discuss your reasons.

08:51.576 --> 08:53.303
Is that when you christened me Chéri?

08:53.442 --> 08:57.807
Well, I expect I thought
one good nickname deserved another.

09:00.108 --> 09:01.802
Kiss me.

09:05.242 --> 09:06.867
Kiss me.

09:20.275 --> 09:23.673
I'm not sure that was very intelligent.

09:27.342 --> 09:29.672
Oh, what? Oh...?

09:29.808 --> 09:32.138
You think I've never kissed
a handsome mouth before?

09:32.676 --> 09:36.301
You think
that's going to make me lose control?

09:37.142 --> 09:39.108
I mean, even if we were to...

09:39.242 --> 09:42.231
Not that I can see that happening.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.603
Well, you raised the subject.

09:48.342 --> 09:51.274
Let's say no more about this, shall we?

10:08.142 --> 10:11.165
The garden smells beautiful
this evening.

10:13.409 --> 10:15.637
It's the rose acacia.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.300
Come here.

12:06.908 --> 12:09.136
Mm.

12:30.175 --> 12:31.902
Nounoune.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.638
- Don't lose your temper.
- I'm not.

12:49.775 --> 12:51.900
Yes. Fatal mistake for a boxer.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.632
- I'm not a boxer.
- Come on.

12:53.775 --> 12:56.105
- Come on.
- Unh. Unh!

12:56.875 --> 12:58.307
No, you're not.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.932
I've known your mother
since she was in the Corps de Ballet.

13:08.342 --> 13:12.399
I first met her
when she was just beginning to realize

13:12.542 --> 13:16.633
that art lovers are a more reliable source
of income than art.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.838
I can't honestly say I've ever liked her.

13:22.975 --> 13:24.907
Nobody does.

13:31.075 --> 13:32.302
Ah!

13:34.641 --> 13:37.540
But you know our profession.

13:37.675 --> 13:41.573
We're really not able
to make friends outside of it.

13:43.209 --> 13:46.198
Women who do what we do,

13:48.708 --> 13:51.640
no one else would ever understand.

13:55.475 --> 13:57.565
Say something.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.106
What?

13:59.875 --> 14:01.773
Tell me something about yourself.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.074
Nothing to tell.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.939
Uh...!

14:23.108 --> 14:25.438
He'll never make a boxer.

14:26.008 --> 14:29.236
I didn't take him on for his boxing skills,
Patron.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.499
No, of course you didn't.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.903
It's strange.

14:34.309 --> 14:35.501
I can't describe it.

14:35.641 --> 14:40.199
It's like being in bed
with an African or a Chinese.

14:40.342 --> 14:43.637
Not that I've ever had that experience.

14:43.775 --> 14:46.333
Oh, I'm sorry, Patron,
am I embarrassing you?

14:46.474 --> 14:47.735
Not at all, madame.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.171
I can't criticize his character,

14:49.309 --> 14:51.570
mainly because
he doesn't seem to have one.

14:52.442 --> 14:54.737
All the other young men
I've had to do with

14:54.875 --> 14:59.205
can't wait to tell you
all their innermost secrets.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.438
He never says a word.

15:02.575 --> 15:07.406
There's something about him,
something mysterious, I can't explain.

15:10.508 --> 15:12.531
We were just talking about you.

15:12.675 --> 15:14.301
If I were a woman, Monsieur Chéri,

15:14.442 --> 15:17.635
I think I'd say,
"I'll come back in ten years time."

15:20.942 --> 15:23.170
Wouldn't do you much good, would it?

15:25.808 --> 15:27.569
Do you enjoy being spiteful?

15:28.342 --> 15:31.172
I always find it cheers me up, yes.

15:32.175 --> 15:37.505
Few weeks, Patron. Just a few weeks,
then I'll send him on his way.

15:38.209 --> 15:39.606
<i>But she didn't,</i>

15:39.741 --> 15:42.935
<i>and six years later</i>
<i>they were still together.</i>

15:43.075 --> 15:44.768
<i>This was something</i>
<i>of a surprise to her,</i>

15:44.908 --> 15:46.806
<i>but the truth is</i>
<i>she felt entirely comfortable</i>

15:46.942 --> 15:49.340
<i>with a companion</i>
<i>so embedded in her own milieu</i>

15:49.474 --> 15:52.736
<i>that he required of her</i>
<i>no pretence whatsoever.</i>

15:52.875 --> 15:54.068
<i>Both of them were dimly aware</i>

15:54.209 --> 15:56.936
<i>that this state of affairs</i>
<i>could not go on indefinitely.</i>

15:57.075 --> 16:01.064
<i>But for now, they were lulled</i>
<i>by the soothing routines of habit.</i>

16:01.209 --> 16:02.266
<i>Every so often,</i>

16:02.408 --> 16:06.431
<i>a disapproving world would draw attention</i>
<i>to the unsuitability of their life together.</i>

16:06.575 --> 16:07.632
<i>They would take note,</i>

16:07.775 --> 16:09.139
<i>and then once again fall back</i>

16:09.275 --> 16:12.434
<i>into the comfortable bickering</i>
<i>of an old married couple.</i>

16:13.075 --> 16:14.438
Can I have it?

16:14.575 --> 16:16.666
It looks just as good on me
as it does on you.

16:19.508 --> 16:23.600
Ugh, take if off,
you'll wear out the thread.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.870
Whoever it was gave you these,
he wasn't kidding.

16:27.008 --> 16:29.940
Did you hear what I said? Take it off.

16:30.975 --> 16:32.998
It'd make a wonderful wedding present.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.074
Who for?
- For me.

16:35.209 --> 16:37.800
Who do you think for? For me.

16:38.474 --> 16:40.100
You're just scared I'll make off with it.

16:40.242 --> 16:42.003
No, but I know you.

16:42.142 --> 16:46.471
If I were to offer it to you,
you're quite capable of accepting.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.673
Well, why wouldn't I?

16:52.342 --> 16:54.069
You can't say I don't look good in them.

16:54.741 --> 16:56.764
If I did, you wouldn't believe me.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.431
Don't scrunch up your nose like that
when you laugh.

17:00.575 --> 17:03.598
- You'll give yourself wrinkles.
- Not for a while.

17:05.641 --> 17:09.403
You know, you can look
really ugly sometimes, you know that?

17:09.540 --> 17:11.564
You're lying.

17:17.473 --> 17:18.997
- It's a minority view.
- Ha, ha.

17:21.942 --> 17:25.032
- No, none of that this morning.
- Yes.

17:25.175 --> 17:28.629
No, you're having lunch with the harpy,
your mother.

17:28.775 --> 17:31.264
Oh, God. And it's already 20 to 12.

17:31.408 --> 17:33.204
- Are you coming?
- No, I've been let off.

17:33.341 --> 17:34.739
I wasn't invited.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.136
- Really?
- Mm.

17:36.275 --> 17:38.173
Strange.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.570
I thought so too.

17:42.308 --> 17:43.934
I've been ordered to join you for tea.

17:46.008 --> 17:47.871
Marie Laure is coming.

17:48.008 --> 17:50.872
With that ghastly daughter of hers.

17:51.008 --> 17:52.997
Her daughter is very pretty.

17:53.142 --> 17:56.733
And clever enough
not to be as pretty as Marie Laure.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.807
If you say so.

17:59.341 --> 18:02.172
Rose. Run my bath.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.564
Ugh, I hate it when you wear a veil.

18:10.142 --> 18:12.903
Really, have you no manners?

18:13.341 --> 18:16.330
Never reproach a woman
for wearing a veil.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.496
She always has her reasons.

18:18.641 --> 18:21.130
Marie Laure, as beautiful as ever.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.797
Lea, I don't know if you remember
my daughter, Edmée.

18:23.942 --> 18:25.373
Of course, I do.

18:25.508 --> 18:28.031
- Have you left school?
- Well, of course she has.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.436
What would a lovely girl of 19
want with school?

18:30.575 --> 18:31.768
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

18:31.908 --> 18:33.204
Eighteen. That's what I meant.

18:33.341 --> 18:35.432
Marie Laure,
you're one of the only women I know

18:35.575 --> 18:38.439
- who could carry off that color.
- Ha, ha.

18:38.575 --> 18:42.940
- Well, I think it's time we were going.
- Surely not. It's still early.

18:43.075 --> 18:45.234
No, well,
the child is not very used to company.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.034
Only because she's had to lead
such a solitary life.

18:48.175 --> 18:50.367
Why don't you all come to lunch
on Thursday.

18:50.508 --> 18:52.838
- I can do that.
- I'll have to check.

18:52.975 --> 18:55.702
- Say goodbye, Edmée.
- Chéri will show you out.

18:55.841 --> 18:57.238
On your feet, lazybones.

18:57.374 --> 18:59.567
Lovely to see you.

19:07.641 --> 19:10.199
Delightful pair. Delightful.

19:10.341 --> 19:12.534
Marie Laure certainly looks magnificent.

19:12.675 --> 19:14.903
Yes, she was very beautiful in her day.

19:15.042 --> 19:18.031
And she can carry off
that awful color of puce.

19:18.175 --> 19:21.005
I suppose she's right
about Edmée being 18.

19:21.142 --> 19:24.699
Yes, she had her the year
after she got that enormous pink diamond

19:24.841 --> 19:27.238
out of Khalil Bey and left him flat.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.602
We always thought that singing teacher
must be the father, didn't we?

19:31.942 --> 19:34.305
Shall we take a turn
around the grounds?

19:38.308 --> 19:40.240
I need to have a word with you
about Chéri.

19:40.374 --> 19:42.102
- I thought as much.
- Ha, ha.

19:42.241 --> 19:44.469
As you know,
I've never stood in your way.

19:44.608 --> 19:46.733
On the contrary,
I've always been grateful to you.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.966
- So I should hope. He's cost me enough.
- Ha-ha-ha.

19:50.274 --> 19:53.070
You know me.
I'm very content with my lot.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.834
I have everything I need.

19:54.975 --> 19:57.338
Not that we haven't worked hard for it,
both of us.

19:57.474 --> 19:58.997
- You know what I'm saying.
- Mm.

19:59.142 --> 20:00.539
But lately...

20:00.675 --> 20:02.641
- Yes?
- I've been thinking about what's missing

20:02.775 --> 20:03.832
from my life.

20:03.975 --> 20:05.032
Oh, not love, surely?

20:05.174 --> 20:07.333
You're always saying how happy you are
to be rid of it.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.838
Ah, ha, goodness, yes.

20:09.975 --> 20:13.270
No,
I mean something altogether different.

20:14.841 --> 20:16.238
Grandchildren.

20:20.341 --> 20:22.069
Grandchildren?

20:22.208 --> 20:24.800
I'm arranging a marriage for Chéri.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.566
- Has he been told?
- Of course, he has.

20:29.708 --> 20:32.173
- Hasn't he said anything to you?
- No.

20:32.308 --> 20:35.433
Ha, ha, oh, what a dreadful boy he is.

20:35.575 --> 20:37.598
I mean,
of course, it's not as if there's any rush.

20:38.575 --> 20:40.632
Oh, you mean,
it's not happening right away?

20:40.775 --> 20:41.832
Oh, good heavens, no.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.941
End of next month.

20:45.075 --> 20:48.234
Ah. You've made a deal
with Marie Laure.

20:48.374 --> 20:50.306
It wasn't easy.

20:50.441 --> 20:53.134
She's hard as nails, that one.
Hard as nails.

20:53.274 --> 20:54.638
She wanted separate bank accounts.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.434
- Can you imagine?
- Easily.

20:56.575 --> 20:58.165
Anyway, it's all arranged now.

20:58.308 --> 21:00.399
What a wonderful life
they're going to have.

21:00.541 --> 21:03.939
- Youth, beauty, money.
- Ha-ha-ha.

21:04.075 --> 21:05.665
What's so funny?

21:05.808 --> 21:10.206
You're throwing Edmée to Chéri
like a Christian to the lions,

21:10.341 --> 21:12.500
and you think she's going to have
a wonderful life?

21:12.641 --> 21:15.402
Wh...? What do you mean?
He's the kindest, sweetest...

21:15.541 --> 21:17.530
- What do you know about him?
- I'm his mother.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.641
Since when?

21:19.975 --> 21:21.406
I'm sorry, Lea.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.973
I'm sorry. How very clumsy of me.

21:24.107 --> 21:25.698
- I've upset you.
- Not in the least.

21:25.841 --> 21:29.364
- Well, naturally, it's come as a shock.
- No, Charlotte, not at all.

21:29.508 --> 21:32.303
I've been expecting it.
I've been expecting it for years.

21:32.441 --> 21:34.407
I've been expecting you
to come and take him away,

21:34.541 --> 21:37.030
and hand him over
to some other loose woman.

21:37.174 --> 21:40.470
Oh, Lea, that's a very ugly expression.

21:40.608 --> 21:42.733
I don't think so.

21:45.741 --> 21:48.536
You have nothing to worry about,
Charlotte.

21:49.042 --> 21:52.405
You're getting him back
in very good condition.

21:52.541 --> 21:55.405
I've kept him away from opium,
and cocaine

21:55.541 --> 21:58.030
and the cheaper sort of drink.

21:58.408 --> 22:01.374
I believe you'll find
he's a credit to both of us.

22:01.508 --> 22:03.269
I'm sure.

22:03.408 --> 22:06.636
It doesn't mean that little girl
is going to be able to handle him.

22:06.775 --> 22:09.570
- Young women have their methods.
- You may be right.

22:09.708 --> 22:12.538
- I can't say I remember.
- Ha.

22:12.975 --> 22:14.964
You were worried,
weren't you, Charlotte?

22:15.107 --> 22:16.733
Admit it.

22:16.875 --> 22:19.670
You were afraid
I was going to bleed all over you.

22:19.808 --> 22:22.399
I was only afraid of one thing.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.803
- That I might cause you suffering.
- Ha-ha-ha.

22:25.942 --> 22:28.032
Oh, that's right. Laugh at me.

22:28.174 --> 22:30.333
Laugh at me
and call me an old romantic.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.463
All I want
is to see the young people happy.

22:32.608 --> 22:35.574
Oh, you always were
disgustingly sentimental.

22:35.708 --> 22:39.265
Oh, come here. Oh.

22:46.308 --> 22:48.968
You smell so good.

22:49.441 --> 22:50.498
Don't you find,

22:50.641 --> 22:56.232
now the skin's a little less firm,
it holds perfume so much better?

23:07.608 --> 23:10.039
The least you could have done
was tell me yourself.

23:10.174 --> 23:12.333
She wanted to tell you.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.304
She thought it would come better
from her.

23:21.708 --> 23:24.003
You and your mother
have been cooking this up for months.

23:24.141 --> 23:27.130
- Why are you giving me a hard time?
- Because you're a coward.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.067
How much is she worth?

23:32.208 --> 23:33.572
A million and a half.

23:35.107 --> 23:37.767
- From her father?
- How should I know?

23:37.908 --> 23:40.135
She doesn't know who her father is
any more than I do.

23:40.274 --> 23:43.866
All I know is,
she's worth a million an a half.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.098
- And you?
- Oh, I'm worth far more than that.

23:47.241 --> 23:50.639
So you'll have more than enough.

23:51.074 --> 23:53.336
More than enough?

23:53.875 --> 23:56.864
You and I don't think about money
the same way, Nounoune.

23:57.007 --> 24:01.269
How much do you think you've saved
while I've been paying for everything?

24:01.408 --> 24:04.431
Fifty thousand a year? Sixty?

24:04.575 --> 24:07.097
Multiplied by six.

24:08.041 --> 24:10.007
Haven't I been worth it?

24:21.575 --> 24:24.938
Anyway, she certainly is very pretty.

24:26.775 --> 24:29.138
She seems quite bright.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.069
What's your impression?

24:33.208 --> 24:35.197
I have no idea.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.500
I expect I'll find out sooner or later.

24:37.641 --> 24:40.368
How does she feel about you?

24:42.941 --> 24:45.737
She admires me.

24:46.308 --> 24:48.706
Loves me as far as I can tell.

24:48.841 --> 24:50.807
- She doesn't say much.
- Mm.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.471
- What about you?
- I didn't say anything.

24:54.308 --> 24:57.502
I see, it's a real love match.

24:57.641 --> 25:00.607
Why do we have to talk about her?
You're the one I'm worried about.

25:00.741 --> 25:03.332
Me? Why?

25:03.474 --> 25:07.839
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do?

25:07.974 --> 25:11.600
What, do you mean,
what am I going to do now?

25:37.974 --> 25:40.338
You're so beautiful.

25:42.974 --> 25:46.407
A good body lasts a long time.

25:47.041 --> 25:49.564
Everyone knows that.

26:01.974 --> 26:03.963
Are you going to be all right?

26:04.107 --> 26:06.039
Of course I am.

26:06.174 --> 26:10.038
It'll be wonderful not to find
all the towels floating in 6 inches of water

26:10.174 --> 26:13.867
every time I come into the bathroom.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.633
I think I'll have it redecorated.

26:19.641 --> 26:21.072
What do you expect me to do?

26:21.208 --> 26:23.265
Go and pine away in Normandy?

26:23.408 --> 26:24.873
Stop dyeing my hair?

26:25.007 --> 26:26.633
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

26:26.774 --> 26:28.967
You're not the first young man
I've said goodbye to.

26:29.107 --> 26:32.834
Yes, I know, but what I thought might
be appropriate is if I were the last.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.829
I'm only thinking of you.

26:36.807 --> 26:38.171
If it's any consolation,

26:38.308 --> 26:40.967
I've been with you longer
than anyone else in my life.

26:41.107 --> 26:44.073
And I've certainly never devoted
as much time and consideration

26:44.208 --> 26:46.299
to the end of any of my affairs.

26:46.441 --> 26:49.737
But you can't expect me
to curl up and die.

26:50.675 --> 26:53.163
When is the wedding, anyway?

26:53.308 --> 26:55.638
September the 25th.

26:56.274 --> 26:58.137
You seem very casual about it.

26:58.274 --> 26:59.830
Why not? It's all been arranged.

27:00.241 --> 27:03.207
Ceremony at 2.
Reception at mother's house.

27:03.341 --> 27:05.966
Sleeper to Italy.
Honeymoon by the lakes.

27:06.107 --> 27:08.471
- Do people still go to the lakes?
- They do.

27:08.608 --> 27:12.506
- And what about the girl?
- What about her? She'll be there.

27:12.907 --> 27:15.271
And I won't be.

27:16.974 --> 27:19.497
Nounoune, you'll always be there.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.973
I mean,
you know, in case I need anything.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.737
You are to be kind to her,
do you hear me?

27:27.907 --> 27:30.237
Don't make her suffer.

27:30.374 --> 27:32.636
It's her turn now.

27:33.141 --> 27:35.164
Mine is over.

27:35.608 --> 27:36.937
That's not what I want.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.271
Oh, I'm afraid, from now on,

27:40.408 --> 27:43.896
what you want
has very little to do with anything.

27:48.241 --> 27:50.173
We'll get Rose to help you pack.

27:50.575 --> 27:52.097
What? Why?

27:52.241 --> 27:55.503
You're getting married next month.
There will be a lot of preparations,

27:55.641 --> 27:58.198
which you'll need to be making
from home.

27:58.341 --> 27:59.398
But...

27:59.541 --> 28:03.598
Can you imagine how rich I'm going to be
when I don't have to pay for you anymore?

28:03.740 --> 28:05.070
What about my replacement?

28:05.208 --> 28:08.402
Oh, some loose change
and a packet of cigarettes.

28:08.541 --> 28:12.734
And a Kir Royal on Sundays,
if he behaves himself.

28:25.241 --> 28:26.729
Say something.

28:27.274 --> 28:29.502
- Nounoune.
- What?

28:30.974 --> 28:32.997
Just say something.

28:36.508 --> 28:37.633
Come on.

28:37.774 --> 28:40.536
Let's go shopping one last time.

28:40.674 --> 28:41.731
What for?

28:41.874 --> 28:44.397
Your wedding present, of course.

28:44.541 --> 28:47.904
There is a big pink pearl at Schwabe's.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.234
Ha, ha, pink?

28:50.374 --> 28:54.999
Ah, let's go for something
a little more masculine, shall we?

28:55.141 --> 28:57.073
A regular white pearl.

28:57.208 --> 28:59.901
I think I know the very one.

29:10.674 --> 29:12.334
Amen.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.767
What do you think?

30:06.174 --> 30:08.140
Beautiful.

30:10.374 --> 30:11.771
When did you get this?

30:11.907 --> 30:13.600
Today.

30:16.074 --> 30:18.665
Isn't that a little flaw?

30:18.807 --> 30:21.898
It's tiny. You have a very good eye.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.666
I've been very well-trained.

30:23.807 --> 30:26.637
Wonderful color, isn't it?

30:27.241 --> 30:29.139
Does this mean
there's someone new in your life?

30:30.041 --> 30:33.132
No, I bought it myself.

30:33.341 --> 30:36.273
Eleven thousand six hundred.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.166
Now, ladies and gentlemen.

30:39.308 --> 30:40.933
Ready?

30:42.107 --> 30:43.437
Oh!

30:44.408 --> 30:46.067
I'm so sorry I have to rush off.

30:46.208 --> 30:49.072
Goodbye, Edmée. Fred.

30:49.208 --> 30:50.867
Enjoy yourselves in Italy.

30:51.007 --> 30:52.496
Bye.

30:52.840 --> 30:57.273
I suppose we're lucky
she got off her back for a couple of hours.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.266
Darling.

31:05.408 --> 31:07.737
Wonderful to see you.

31:09.374 --> 31:11.703
I must have been sad before
like this, Rose.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.703
Can you remember?

31:13.840 --> 31:15.863
After little Lequellec, perhaps?

31:16.007 --> 31:18.473
No, madame,
it was Monsieur Bacciocchi.

31:18.607 --> 31:19.766
Oh.

31:19.907 --> 31:23.703
- You cried for days.
- I was only 28 then.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.738
My mistake was keeping Chéri
for six years.

31:26.874 --> 31:28.170
Being with someone for six years

31:28.308 --> 31:31.103
is like following your husband
to the colonies.

31:31.241 --> 31:33.832
Time you come back, you've forgotten
what you're supposed to wear,

31:33.974 --> 31:36.769
and nobody remembers who you are.

31:36.907 --> 31:38.839
Do you mind opening the window?

31:38.974 --> 31:40.167
Is that a good idea?

31:40.308 --> 31:42.035
It's really stuffy in here.

31:42.174 --> 31:43.969
I don't like doing it.

31:44.107 --> 31:45.868
It would be so easy for somebody
to climb in.

31:46.007 --> 31:48.996
Oh, promises, promises.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.238
I'm sure I should be telling you lovebirds
something,

32:00.374 --> 32:02.703
but I can't think for the life of me what.

32:02.840 --> 32:03.897
Hardly surprising.

32:04.041 --> 32:08.030
Isn't this the first time
anyone's ever been married in our family?

32:08.374 --> 32:10.635
Goodbye, darling.

32:10.774 --> 32:12.740
Goodbye.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.699
All aboard.

32:16.507 --> 32:17.632
Goodbye, darling.

32:18.574 --> 32:20.563
Goodbye.

34:09.174 --> 34:11.661
How old are you anyway?

34:12.473 --> 34:15.530
I told you, I'm 19 in January.

34:16.607 --> 34:18.505
It's obscene.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.538
Well, you're only 25.

34:26.806 --> 34:29.601
Twenty-five years old.

34:30.340 --> 34:34.205
I don't know why I find it shocking
that you're so much younger than me.

34:36.274 --> 34:39.330
You have such beautiful eyes, Fred.

34:42.274 --> 34:44.637
Yes. Do you know why?

34:44.774 --> 34:46.864
Is it because I love them?

34:47.306 --> 34:48.466
No, it's not.

34:48.873 --> 34:52.328
It's because my eye
is shaped like a sole.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.937
When you're finished with that hat,
Madame Lea,

35:22.074 --> 35:23.131
I hope you'll think of me.

35:23.273 --> 35:24.899
That blue one that you gave me,
remember?

35:25.041 --> 35:26.370
It lasted me two years.

35:26.507 --> 35:29.268
I can just see you in that hat, Aldonza.

35:29.407 --> 35:31.339
I hope you don't run
into any pregnant women.

35:31.473 --> 35:33.234
I know what suits me,
thank you very much.

35:33.373 --> 35:36.169
I wore a hat very like that
when I danced <i>Sylvia</i>

35:36.307 --> 35:39.138
at the Turkish gala in the '89 exhibition.

35:39.273 --> 35:40.739
Do you remember, Charlotte?

35:40.874 --> 35:43.601
No, I left halfway through the evening
with Count Orloff,

35:43.740 --> 35:45.501
and didn't get back for two years.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.800
I don't know how you could go off
like that with a strange man.

35:48.941 --> 35:50.770
All men are strange.

35:51.141 --> 35:53.265
Hear, hear.
- Yes, but I mean to say...

35:53.407 --> 35:55.396
Shut up and deal.

35:55.540 --> 35:57.972
Ow, oh! My arthritis.

35:58.107 --> 36:02.300
And to think I used
to have the most beautiful hands.

36:02.440 --> 36:06.930
King Alfonso XII used to drink
from my cupped palms.

36:07.074 --> 36:09.972
He called them
his mother-of-pearl seashells.

36:10.107 --> 36:12.164
I always thought
he was one of the duller kings.

36:12.307 --> 36:15.001
He adored my hair,
down below my knees.

36:15.141 --> 36:16.697
Monsieur de Thou, the deputy,

36:16.840 --> 36:20.704
used to say there was enough hair
to carpet the stairway to heaven.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.499
- And now what's left?
- A very nice wig.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.469
Are you all right, Lea, my dear?

36:25.607 --> 36:27.664
You don't seem quite your usual self.

36:27.807 --> 36:29.137
No, I'm fine.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.103
Except for having eaten that vast meal.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.604
I'm going to have to go on a diet.

36:33.740 --> 36:36.171
- Oh. Haven't you suffered enough?
- What...?

36:38.974 --> 36:40.269
Oh, you mean that.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.703
No, I wish it worked that way.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.931
I'd give up any number of young men
if it meant I could lose a few kilos.

36:47.473 --> 36:50.303
You're amazing, Lea.
There's nobody like you.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.167
Keep your eyes on the cards.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.906
Have you ever seen weather
like this in October?

36:56.041 --> 36:57.870
You're right, it's extraordinary.

36:58.007 --> 37:02.064
And if it's like this here, just imagine
what it must be like in Italy.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.233
Are you all right, my dear?

37:06.373 --> 37:08.999
I'm just going
to get a breath of fresh air.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.532
Lea. Lea.

37:57.674 --> 37:59.765
Come back, they've arrived.

37:59.907 --> 38:00.964
Who?

38:01.106 --> 38:02.766
The happy couple.

38:06.807 --> 38:09.069
Lea. Lea, darling, it's been,

38:09.207 --> 38:10.332
mm, ages.

38:10.473 --> 38:13.132
And this is Prince Guido,
the love of my life.

38:13.273 --> 38:14.364
Perhaps you've already met.

38:14.507 --> 38:16.769
- Yes, of course, of course, madame.
- No, don't slobber.

38:16.907 --> 38:18.532
Oh, he's gorgeous, isn't he?

38:18.674 --> 38:21.105
A touch of restraint
wouldn't come amiss, Lili.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.399
No, no, Baronne,
don't be such a curmudgeon.

38:23.540 --> 38:24.767
Please, sit.

38:24.907 --> 38:27.532
They're very sweet together.

38:27.674 --> 38:29.367
They remind me of the children.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.302
That's why we came,
to ask how they were.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.804
- How was the wedding?
- Glorious, glorious.

38:33.941 --> 38:36.964
A riot of orange blossom,
and the bride looked like a dream.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.800
A Madonna. A Madonna.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.270
And my boy was walking on air.

38:41.407 --> 38:43.373
What news of the honeymoon?

38:43.507 --> 38:45.769
- Italy, the lakes.
- Oh, idyllic.

38:45.907 --> 38:50.100
Yes, I remember when General Petrescu
took me to Florence and Venice.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.468
- In a coach?
- No, no, by train.

38:52.607 --> 38:55.801
Weren't they horribly uncomfortable,
those early trains?

38:55.941 --> 38:58.930
Not like the ones
my Chéri and Edmée have been taking.

38:59.073 --> 39:01.904
Don't you have any more colorful details
for us?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.233
Oh. I can't think what you mean.

39:04.373 --> 39:06.896
I'm sorry, it's my weakness.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.438
Guido will tell you that I adore it
when he talks dirty.

39:10.574 --> 39:13.062
Speaking of which,
do we think that Marie Laure

39:13.207 --> 39:15.173
gave the bride any words of advice?

39:15.307 --> 39:16.967
Marie Laure couldn't wait to get away.

39:17.106 --> 39:19.732
I wouldn't think she'd ever had
such a thing as a conversation

39:19.874 --> 39:21.737
with her daughter in her life.

39:21.874 --> 39:26.169
Then did no one give the poor
little thing her instructions for newlyweds?

39:26.307 --> 39:30.399
In this day and age, Lili,
people know what they're doing.

39:30.540 --> 39:32.904
At least, my Chéri does.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.301
Doesn't he, darling?

39:35.307 --> 39:37.739
Of course, Guido and I
would get married tomorrow

39:37.874 --> 39:39.203
if he were of age.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.533
Really, Lili?

39:40.674 --> 39:43.606
Then I'd be a real princess,
wouldn't I, Guido?

39:46.307 --> 39:48.796
He always calls me his <i>principessa.</i>

39:48.941 --> 39:50.429
Don't you, darling?

39:50.574 --> 39:53.540
The only problem is his father.

39:53.674 --> 39:56.162
My father is the duke of Parese.

39:56.307 --> 39:58.899
He says if I marry Lili,
he'll put me in a convent.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.472
- A convent?
- Sounds delicious.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.368
Oh, come here, my darling.

40:03.507 --> 40:06.302
Come and kiss me. Mm!

40:07.207 --> 40:10.401
Oh, yes. Ha-ha-ha.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.729
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

40:12.874 --> 40:14.897
Don't worry.
It's good luck, spilling a glass.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.563
Unless, of course, it's colored glass.

40:16.707 --> 40:17.764
I have to leave.

40:17.907 --> 40:19.270
Why? Where's the fire?

40:19.407 --> 40:23.032
Well, I'm not sure
there's a delicate answer to that.

40:23.173 --> 40:24.571
You don't mean...?

40:24.707 --> 40:26.195
What? Already?

40:26.340 --> 40:27.431
Thank you for lunch.

40:27.574 --> 40:29.506
You can't leave us
in suspense like this.

40:29.640 --> 40:30.799
No, tell us, tell us.

40:30.940 --> 40:32.270
You've got to tell us everything.

40:32.407 --> 40:34.873
No, it's too early in the day.
It has to be a secret.

40:35.006 --> 40:36.302
What? Wha...?

40:36.440 --> 40:39.031
For the time being at least.

40:39.874 --> 40:41.396
Wha...?

40:52.540 --> 40:54.563
Good evening, madame.

40:59.574 --> 41:02.301
I'll need a fire in my room tonight, Rose.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.497
The heat is on, madame, but of course.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.503
And I'll need a hot water bottle as well.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.799
Just some toast and grapes for dinner.

41:08.940 --> 41:12.065
Tell Marcel to do me
that chocolate with an egg yolk beaten in.

41:12.207 --> 41:14.070
Yes, madame.

41:47.607 --> 41:48.936
Mm!

42:05.173 --> 42:08.162
Chéri.

42:31.173 --> 42:34.435
You're up very early this morning,
madame.

42:34.574 --> 42:36.164
Are you all right?

42:36.307 --> 42:37.568
Not really.

42:37.707 --> 42:39.002
What's the matter?

42:39.140 --> 42:42.129
You know, age.

42:48.873 --> 42:50.601
You know what we're going to do,
Rose?

42:51.040 --> 42:54.802
We're going to get in the car
and drive down to Biarritz.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.770
Towards the sun.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.502
<i>My dear Charlotte,</i>

43:08.640 --> 43:12.765
<i>I'm sorry to slip away</i>
<i>without saying a proper goodbye.</i>

43:12.906 --> 43:16.236
<i>I am probably making</i>
<i>a complete fool of myself.</i>

43:16.373 --> 43:17.838
<i>But then again, why not?</i>

43:17.973 --> 43:19.269
<i>Life is short.</i>

43:19.407 --> 43:21.600
<i>Let's do our best to enjoy it.</i>

43:21.740 --> 43:24.672
<i>Remember me to the boy</i>
<i>when he comes back.</i>

43:24.806 --> 43:28.466
<i>P.S., don't bother</i>
<i>to try bribing my butler.</i>

43:28.607 --> 43:34.005
<i>No one in my household</i>
<i>knows anything about this escapade.</i>

43:36.540 --> 43:37.937
So, what did he say?

43:38.073 --> 43:40.766
He said that he wasn't going
to be able to come along to see us

43:40.906 --> 43:42.769
for at least another 18 months.

43:44.073 --> 43:45.198
Madame.

43:45.340 --> 43:49.738
<i>The Hotel Grand Palais</i>
<i>in Biarritz had, for some years now,</i>

43:49.873 --> 43:52.567
<i>been a happy hunting ground</i>
<i>for Lea and her like.</i>

43:52.707 --> 43:53.797
Put those over there.

43:53.940 --> 43:57.031
<i>A place where you might</i>
<i>easily find yourself shoulder to shoulder</i>

43:57.173 --> 43:59.298
<i>with the British prime minister.</i>

43:59.440 --> 44:03.804
<i>Or in some more intimate posture,</i>
<i>with the Prince of Wales.</i>

44:05.240 --> 44:09.831
<i>However, this time, it was not a customer</i>
<i>Lea was on the lookout for,</i>

44:09.973 --> 44:12.303
<i>it was a consolation.</i>

44:33.473 --> 44:35.836
Madam, monsieur.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.429
Have you seen Jocelyn?

45:21.739 --> 45:25.331
Won't you join my son and me
for a pot of tea, madame?

45:25.607 --> 45:29.596
That's so kind. I'd be delighted.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.402
Welcome home, darling.

45:40.540 --> 45:41.869
How are you?

45:42.006 --> 45:44.598
How are you?
Let me have a look at you.

45:44.739 --> 45:46.330
Oh, you're not looking at all well.

45:46.473 --> 45:50.166
- Two days on the train. I'm fine.
- Are you all right, dear?

45:50.307 --> 45:52.330
I've been feeling a bit tired.
- Good, good.

45:52.473 --> 45:54.371
But you must tell me
what's the matter with him.

45:54.507 --> 45:58.996
Have you been looking after him properly?
He's looking positively sinister.

46:14.273 --> 46:17.670
Thank you.
Thank you for a most wonderful evening.

46:22.606 --> 46:26.369
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap, would you?

46:40.773 --> 46:42.296
Ah.

46:42.773 --> 46:44.671
What was the date on the letter?

46:44.806 --> 46:48.761
- What letter is that, darling?
- The letter from Lea, as you well know.

46:48.906 --> 46:51.065
Oh, I'm not sure.

46:51.207 --> 46:53.832
Sometime
around the beginning of October.

46:53.973 --> 46:56.996
And you say you don't know who it is?

46:57.140 --> 46:58.401
Who what is, my love?

46:59.806 --> 47:01.965
The man she went away with.

47:02.106 --> 47:03.402
This is the thing.

47:04.273 --> 47:07.262
Nobody knows. A total mystery.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.633
Of course, you know me.

47:08.773 --> 47:11.467
I've been able to make a few inquiries.

47:11.606 --> 47:12.765
And?

47:13.639 --> 47:17.094
He's young. Very young, I'm told.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.070
Not someone you'd boast about,
but very...

47:20.207 --> 47:24.230
Mm. You know, handsome.

47:30.573 --> 47:33.472
Be some muscle-bound boxer
if I know anything.

47:34.839 --> 47:37.862
Good to have some decent coffee
at last after all that Italian muck.

47:38.839 --> 47:40.237
Do you like my new outfit?

47:40.606 --> 47:42.266
How do I look in this bonnet?

47:42.873 --> 47:46.237
Like an old convict.
Enough to give anyone a fright.

47:49.073 --> 47:50.936
Oh, it goes without saying

47:51.073 --> 47:53.164
you're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

47:53.307 --> 47:54.533
As long as you like.

47:54.673 --> 47:58.401
I can't stay here.
I'm allergic to rag and bone shops.

47:58.539 --> 48:00.301
I don't know where else
you're going to stay.

48:00.440 --> 48:03.803
They haven't nearly finished
your house.

48:09.839 --> 48:13.237
Bastard builder says it's going
to take another four months.

48:13.373 --> 48:15.565
Look at them. Four months.

48:15.706 --> 48:17.332
Pull away.

48:19.407 --> 48:22.430
- Fred?
- What?

48:22.806 --> 48:25.295
Doesn't she live near here?

48:25.739 --> 48:27.830
Other side of the park.

48:28.806 --> 48:31.398
You go back.
I have just thought of something.

48:35.373 --> 48:38.339
- All right, Marcel?
- Monsieur Peloux.

48:38.739 --> 48:42.137
- Hard at work as ever.
- Very nice to see you again, sir.

48:42.273 --> 48:44.500
I hope madame is well.

48:45.106 --> 48:47.936
Couldn't really tell you, sir.
We've only had the odd postcard.

48:48.073 --> 48:50.595
- Where from?
- Not rightly sure, sir.

48:50.739 --> 48:53.103
We send all her mail to the lawyer
and he forwards it.

49:01.140 --> 49:03.605
Money between us, sir?
There's no need for that.

49:04.673 --> 49:08.071
Anyway, can't tell you what I don't know.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.229
I could give you the name
of madame's lawyer.

49:10.373 --> 49:12.100
No, it's all right.

49:13.606 --> 49:16.436
- When will she be back?
- No idea, sir.

49:16.573 --> 49:18.335
Whenever she feels like it.

49:18.739 --> 49:21.899
We keep the place ticking over
just in case.

49:22.040 --> 49:24.199
But, you know,
I wouldn't be in the least surprised

49:24.340 --> 49:25.703
if you said to me now:

49:25.839 --> 49:27.998
"There she is
coming around the corner."

49:37.806 --> 49:42.239
So finally,
the whole thing was just up to mother.

49:42.373 --> 49:45.032
But I found it so powerful.

49:45.173 --> 49:47.604
- It was so powerful. Moving.
- Yes.

49:47.739 --> 49:50.500
To my core,
I've never had an experience like it.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.728
I'll go and see how cook is doing
with the duck.

49:53.873 --> 49:56.464
We'll have to try
and put a bit of flesh on you, Lea.

49:56.606 --> 49:58.902
You're a bag of bones.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.767
Are you having trouble with your memory,
Madame Peloux? Occasional blackouts?

50:02.906 --> 50:05.667
- What can you mean?
- You called Edmée Lea.

50:05.806 --> 50:08.295
It's the third time you've done it today.

50:08.439 --> 50:09.496
Don't mind me, dear.

50:09.639 --> 50:12.730
I have so much on my mind,
I can scarcely remember my own name.

50:12.873 --> 50:15.498
No one's ever as busy as the person
with nothing to do.

50:22.173 --> 50:24.434
Perhaps you should send her
on a rest cure.

50:24.973 --> 50:26.632
Thank you for defending me.

50:26.773 --> 50:30.364
Or was it her you were defending,
my predecessor?

50:33.372 --> 50:36.134
You're not scared
of my illustrious mother, are you?

50:36.273 --> 50:38.262
When a door slams,
it can give you a shock.

50:39.106 --> 50:42.004
But it's not as frightening as the snake
that slides under the door.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.435
You mean, your mother?

50:43.573 --> 50:45.539
I don't know
if you could call her a mother.

50:45.673 --> 50:47.798
She never noticed me
until I started to look pretty,

50:47.940 --> 50:50.133
and then she couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

50:51.273 --> 50:53.636
I just got left
with all Madame Peloux's friends.

50:53.773 --> 50:55.932
That's why I know how to do petit point.

50:56.073 --> 50:58.937
Or, look, old Madame Aldonza
from the ballet

50:59.073 --> 51:01.971
showed me how to do
an entrechat quatre.

51:12.773 --> 51:16.001
So I suppose we're both orphans, really.

51:18.173 --> 51:20.071
Yes, that's right.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.867
Orphans.

51:30.906 --> 51:33.303
Chéri, what's the matter?

51:36.839 --> 51:38.805
You called me Chéri.

51:39.539 --> 51:41.562
Well, you're frightening me.

51:42.306 --> 51:44.295
Are you all right, Fred?

51:45.606 --> 51:48.868
Yes, it's just the thought
of our being orphans, that's all.

52:20.306 --> 52:23.534
Why do you always turn your back
on me?

52:29.940 --> 52:32.872
You haven't been listening
to a word I've been saying.

52:33.006 --> 52:34.403
What?

52:35.773 --> 52:37.636
You never listen to what anyone says.

52:40.639 --> 52:43.332
I expect you were thinking
about your Lea.

52:45.106 --> 52:47.731
Yes, as a matter of fact I was.

53:09.839 --> 53:11.828
I hate you.

53:12.372 --> 53:15.066
You don't love me. You never loved me.

53:15.206 --> 53:19.161
You're hardly even aware I exist.
You're a degenerate.

53:20.172 --> 53:23.297
All you ever think about
is that old woman.

53:31.306 --> 53:35.932
- I'm sorry you find me so boring.
- It's not that.

53:36.073 --> 53:38.664
- It's just I have no idea what it is you want.
- What I want?

53:38.806 --> 53:40.102
- Listen.
- No.

53:40.239 --> 53:41.967
No, I don't want one of your lectures.

53:42.106 --> 53:44.970
I don't want to be told
why I'm too young to know what's going on

53:45.106 --> 53:47.663
or why your eye is shaped like a mullet.

53:47.806 --> 53:48.965
A sole.

53:53.606 --> 53:57.004
I just can't understand
why you're so aggrieved.

53:58.272 --> 54:00.966
Do I go out on my own in the evening?

54:01.739 --> 54:03.602
Do I sleep in a separate bedroom?

54:05.206 --> 54:08.105
- Am I having an affair?
- How would I know?

54:09.573 --> 54:12.505
Don't you like the way I make love
to you?

54:15.339 --> 54:17.703
You call that love?

54:17.873 --> 54:19.930
Oh, God.

54:20.073 --> 54:21.971
Oh, my God.

54:24.006 --> 54:27.460
Mm, oh, my God. Oh, God.

54:28.139 --> 54:31.469
Oh, God. Mm. Mm.

54:32.206 --> 54:33.638
<i>At times of insecurity,</i>

54:33.773 --> 54:36.705
<i>Chéri's instinct was to return</i>
<i>like a homing pigeon</i>

54:36.839 --> 54:39.032
<i>to the familiar distractions of Maxim's.</i>

54:39.172 --> 54:41.297
Good evening.
Is the Vicomte Desmond in this evening?

54:41.439 --> 54:42.496
Chéri.

54:42.639 --> 54:45.071
<i>The impersonal friendship,</i>
<i>the exaggerated laughter,</i>

54:45.206 --> 54:48.138
<i>the clink of glasses</i>
<i>and the sound of gypsy violins.</i>

54:48.272 --> 54:49.966
Fred. Well, well, well.

54:50.105 --> 54:51.935
Mind if I join you?
- Delighted.

54:52.072 --> 54:54.095
What are you drinking now
you're an old married man?

54:54.239 --> 54:55.296
Chamomile tea?

54:55.439 --> 54:57.132
Pommery as usual.

54:57.272 --> 54:58.636
Something else to get you started?

54:58.773 --> 55:01.898
Pommery first. Pommery last.

55:16.072 --> 55:17.436
Can I ask you a favor?

55:17.573 --> 55:19.471
Of course. What?

55:19.606 --> 55:22.902
Make a call to Neuilly.
Ask for my mother.

55:23.039 --> 55:24.903
Tell her I'm having dinner with you.

55:25.039 --> 55:28.006
Suppose I get Madame Peloux,
your wife.

55:28.139 --> 55:31.333
Tell her the same thing.
She's very well-trained.

55:31.906 --> 55:34.633
Who is that woman staring at me?

55:34.906 --> 55:36.531
You know, that's La Loupiote.

55:36.673 --> 55:42.004
A friend of Lea's or a colleague,
I suppose, once upon a time.

56:02.005 --> 56:03.904
You didn't even say hello to me.

56:04.039 --> 56:06.335
Hello. How are you?

56:07.339 --> 56:09.737
Some people have all the luck,
don't they?

56:09.873 --> 56:13.305
Pretty as a picture and rolling in money.

56:23.606 --> 56:26.071
All the luck and no clue
what to do with it.

56:29.573 --> 56:31.505
Get off home back to your mommy.

56:32.773 --> 56:34.568
Poor boy.

56:39.839 --> 56:41.737
Evening, monsieur.

56:48.139 --> 56:50.469
It was a splendid evening.

56:50.773 --> 56:53.330
I thought we were going out.

56:53.472 --> 56:56.336
- I'm going up to bed.
- Oh?

56:58.439 --> 57:00.996
I'm going to take a room here.

57:03.606 --> 57:05.196
You go.

57:12.239 --> 57:15.103
And how long will you be staying,
monsieur?

57:15.539 --> 57:17.402
I don't know.

57:17.873 --> 57:20.805
Let's just take it one day at a time,
shall we?

58:31.939 --> 58:35.531
Shall I introduce you to the English girl?

58:36.639 --> 58:38.104
No.

58:40.139 --> 58:44.595
I tell you,
she knows some amazing tricks.

58:45.739 --> 58:47.136
I said no.

58:50.105 --> 58:52.935
Can I do something for you, my dear?

58:53.072 --> 58:55.265
Shall I make you a pipe?

58:57.806 --> 58:59.431
No, thank you.

58:59.573 --> 59:02.061
I'll have some cocaine.

59:06.673 --> 59:08.934
I'm so sorry.

59:09.739 --> 59:12.034
I know what the trouble is.

59:12.172 --> 59:14.400
You have everything
you can possibly want.

59:15.905 --> 59:18.394
And none of it means a thing.

59:25.105 --> 59:28.128
The thing is, I don't know where she is.

59:29.339 --> 59:31.271
Or who she's with.

59:38.272 --> 59:39.897
It's all right, you don't need to worry.

59:46.573 --> 59:47.766
They're fake.

01:00:35.905 --> 01:00:37.768
I'll go.

01:00:47.472 --> 01:00:48.699
What is it?

01:00:48.838 --> 01:00:51.703
Lea. May I come up and see you?

01:00:51.838 --> 01:00:52.895
I'm busy.

01:00:53.905 --> 01:00:55.098
Just for a few minutes.

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:57.171
I don't think so. Not this evening.

01:00:57.772 --> 01:00:59.432
Later perhaps.
At the end of the evening.

01:00:59.939 --> 01:01:02.405
Give my regards to your mother.

01:01:18.573 --> 01:01:20.004
Oh, it's you.

01:01:22.172 --> 01:01:24.001
How long is this going to go on?

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:26.162
I don't know.

01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:28.135
It's been nearly three weeks now.

01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:30.737
Poor little Edmée is frantic with worry.

01:01:30.872 --> 01:01:33.566
On the contrary,
her letter was extremely calm.

01:01:33.705 --> 01:01:35.569
What letter? Show it to me.

01:01:35.705 --> 01:01:37.671
- I threw it away.
- Ugh.

01:01:37.805 --> 01:01:41.999
But she said she'd wait to hear from me
and sent regards from all your friends.

01:01:42.905 --> 01:01:45.303
Looks like Marie Laure
really did bring her up properly.

01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:46.802
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

01:01:46.939 --> 01:01:48.928
I strongly doubt it.

01:01:53.239 --> 01:01:55.603
Who is it, my darling?

01:01:55.772 --> 01:01:58.102
You can tell me.

01:02:13.406 --> 01:02:14.599
Rose.

01:02:14.738 --> 01:02:16.727
It's a postcard from old Lili.

01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:21.998
Chéri, Monsieur Peloux, has run off.

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.537
Oh, he's left his wife.

01:02:24.805 --> 01:02:28.669
Can't say it comes
as any surprise to me, madame.

01:02:29.172 --> 01:02:31.763
I dare say the divorce will be more fun
than the wedding.

01:02:36.105 --> 01:02:38.900
That goes straight up to madame's room.

01:02:40.072 --> 01:02:41.799
- Straighten that one.
- Right.

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:51.095
Bring that bag up.

01:02:51.239 --> 01:02:52.898
Come along.

01:03:19.672 --> 01:03:21.400
Francois.

01:03:22.072 --> 01:03:24.163
Francois.

01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:27.729
Monsieur.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:31.295
Take this lot into the house for me,
would you?

01:03:34.072 --> 01:03:36.038
They're for Madame Peloux.

01:03:39.705 --> 01:03:41.433
My wife.

01:03:58.805 --> 01:04:00.668
Are you back now?

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.428
Yes.

01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:07.461
Yes.

01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:11.700
Back for good.

01:04:25.972 --> 01:04:28.370
Three hundred and twenty francs
for Vaseline.

01:04:28.505 --> 01:04:31.336
What does Ernest do? Drink it?

01:04:33.805 --> 01:04:35.566
We ought to burn all of these.

01:04:42.772 --> 01:04:47.137
Twice yesterday,
I thought I saw Chéri on the street.

01:04:52.206 --> 01:04:54.728
Do you think he'll ever come back?

01:04:54.872 --> 01:04:57.168
I couldn't say, madame.

01:04:58.072 --> 01:04:59.299
Do you want him to?

01:04:59.439 --> 01:05:01.734
No, I saved him once.

01:05:01.872 --> 01:05:04.702
I couldn't do it all over again.

01:05:08.206 --> 01:05:09.865
Do you think I should change my hair?

01:05:19.605 --> 01:05:21.094
Madame.

01:05:33.339 --> 01:05:34.634
- Charlotte.
- Lea.

01:05:34.772 --> 01:05:37.829
You're back home.
And Chéri's back home as well.

01:05:37.972 --> 01:05:40.529
Back with his lovely wife.

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:42.427
The young couple
are happier than ever.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:46.027
So all is well with the world.

01:05:48.738 --> 01:05:50.295
I don't know if you heard.

01:05:50.438 --> 01:05:52.996
But he disappeared on us
for weeks on end.

01:05:53.405 --> 01:05:55.395
We had no idea where he was.

01:05:55.538 --> 01:05:57.970
We were worried sick.

01:05:58.105 --> 01:05:59.832
Anyway, that's all in the past.

01:05:59.972 --> 01:06:01.199
What a relief.

01:06:01.339 --> 01:06:05.566
I must say, my dear.
You look more beautiful than ever.

01:06:06.772 --> 01:06:09.364
I don't know how you manage it.

01:06:09.505 --> 01:06:12.131
But, of course, you know,
Chéri was just sowing a few wild oats.

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:13.737
Is that so?

01:06:13.872 --> 01:06:15.565
I wouldn't dream of blaming you,

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.228
but you had such a tight hold on him.

01:06:17.372 --> 01:06:19.564
With any luck,
he'll have got it out of his system.

01:06:19.705 --> 01:06:21.830
That's exactly what I said
to his little wife.

01:06:21.972 --> 01:06:23.597
I must say, she was astonishing.

01:06:23.738 --> 01:06:25.931
Of course, she was very lucky
to have me there with her.

01:06:26.072 --> 01:06:27.628
You took the words out of my mouth.

01:06:27.772 --> 01:06:29.965
Even so, my dear,
she behaved like a saint.

01:06:30.105 --> 01:06:32.969
Sweetness and light.
Sweetness and light.

01:06:33.105 --> 01:06:34.365
Patience on a monument.

01:06:34.505 --> 01:06:36.733
- Not one single word of reproach.
- Frightening.

01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:38.770
And when he came back, all smiles,

01:06:38.905 --> 01:06:40.996
as if he'd just got in
from a stroll in the park,

01:06:41.139 --> 01:06:44.003
she didn't open her mouth.
They just headed straight for the bedroom.

01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:46.968
I can promise you,
for the next hour and a half,

01:06:47.105 --> 01:06:50.003
there wasn't a woman in the world
happier than me.

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:52.394
Except possibly Edmée.

01:06:54.206 --> 01:06:56.104
Oh, no. Ha-ha-ha.

01:06:56.505 --> 01:06:59.835
I don't think Edmée's very keen
on all that. Ha, ha.

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:02.802
Bit of a cold fish, I'd say.
Like her mother.

01:07:03.638 --> 01:07:05.070
Is that right?

01:07:05.206 --> 01:07:08.569
Anyway, the important thing
is that he's now ready to settle down.

01:07:08.705 --> 01:07:09.830
Love his house.

01:07:09.972 --> 01:07:13.495
He'll take care of his money
and he'll adore his children.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:17.932
Well, you don't have to make it sound
quite so depressing.

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.630
This cognac is 74 years old.

01:07:29.772 --> 01:07:32.034
Oh, must be appallingly expensive.

01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:35.934
Lotte, that's sweet of you
to be concerned.

01:07:36.072 --> 01:07:40.800
You wouldn't be if you knew how much my
oil stocks had gone up this last quarter.

01:07:41.139 --> 01:07:43.071
You never told me you were in oil.

01:07:43.206 --> 01:07:46.296
You were wrapped up
in your matrimonial arrangements.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:49.269
Not too wrapped up
to miss buying into Compressed Fuels.

01:07:49.405 --> 01:07:52.303
Well, and you never told me either.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:57.767
The last thing I wanted was to barge in
on your new love affair.

01:07:57.905 --> 01:08:00.496
How is all that, by the way?
Still happy?

01:08:00.638 --> 01:08:02.627
- Very.
- Do you have a photo?

01:08:02.772 --> 01:08:05.068
Your spies haven't come up
with anything, then?

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.933
Oh, what spies?

01:08:07.072 --> 01:08:09.129
You know I never listen to gossip.

01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:11.067
But Chéri said to me this morning,
just as l...

01:08:11.206 --> 01:08:12.263
He knew you were coming?

01:08:12.405 --> 01:08:13.598
Of course.

01:08:15.572 --> 01:08:16.902
Why should that make you blush?

01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:19.828
So you told him I was back?

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.165
No.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.169
He told me.

01:08:23.305 --> 01:08:24.430
He sent me.

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:28.331
He was so anxious
to have some news of you.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.135
What do you expect?

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.260
How could he forget a woman like you?

01:08:34.837 --> 01:08:38.462
If you want my opinion,
you've only to lift a finger...

01:08:38.604 --> 01:08:40.935
I don't want your opinion.

01:08:48.404 --> 01:08:51.997
That woman always makes me feel
so grubby.

01:08:52.139 --> 01:08:55.071
I can't stop myself
from going down to her level.

01:08:55.206 --> 01:08:56.899
She's always been a troublemaker.

01:08:57.038 --> 01:08:59.903
I landed a good few blows today.

01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:04.232
We're like two dogs
fighting over an old slipper.

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:06.229
She made me realize something.

01:09:06.371 --> 01:09:09.531
When we parted, Chéri and I,

01:09:09.671 --> 01:09:15.071
we each lost the only
really honorable thing in our lives.

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:25.761
Beautiful handles, don't you think,
for such an old vase?

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:27.700
Yes, madame.

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:34.968
Maybe I should start a business.
What do you think?

01:09:36.537 --> 01:09:38.470
Aline Mesmacker
opened that restaurant.

01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:41.298
Apparently, she's making a fortune.

01:09:41.638 --> 01:09:43.694
Or I could finance Khun.

01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:47.395
I know he wants
to open his own fashion house.

01:09:47.537 --> 01:09:53.163
Ugh, what am I talking about?
I've always hated the idea of working.

01:09:53.638 --> 01:09:56.433
This was my only place of business.

01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:59.936
And the customers have all gone.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.804
It's after midnight.

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:14.030
Go see who it is.

01:10:17.072 --> 01:10:18.129
Monsieur Peloux.

01:10:18.271 --> 01:10:20.362
There's something
I have to talk to her about.

01:10:20.505 --> 01:10:22.630
Madame would be ready
to see you in the morning.

01:10:22.772 --> 01:10:25.567
Shan't be more than five minutes.
- Monsieur, please.

01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:27.935
Monsieur, no. Please don't go up.

01:10:28.072 --> 01:10:30.230
Out of my way, Rose.
- No, monsieur, please.

01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:31.564
No. Madame...

01:10:31.705 --> 01:10:34.603
No, Madame is not here...
Monsieur, no.

01:10:35.005 --> 01:10:36.470
No.

01:10:36.905 --> 01:10:38.268
Madame...

01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:40.997
I'll deal with this, Rose.

01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:46.295
You might, at least, take your hat off.

01:10:48.905 --> 01:10:51.666
- May I sit down?
- If you want to.

01:10:55.405 --> 01:10:56.735
Do you mind if I smoke?

01:10:57.939 --> 01:10:59.996
Do what you like.

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:03.962
Marcel let me in.

01:11:04.104 --> 01:11:05.331
Well, why wouldn't he have?

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:08.699
You expect me to change my staff
every time you get married?

01:11:08.838 --> 01:11:11.998
- No, all I meant was...
- How long were you intending to stay?

01:11:12.138 --> 01:11:14.071
Please note I haven't asked you
what you mean

01:11:14.205 --> 01:11:16.398
by bursting in on me
in the middle of the night.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:20.067
- You can ask, if you like.
- No, I'm not interested.

01:11:21.538 --> 01:11:24.595
So you don't even want to know
why I'm here?

01:11:26.205 --> 01:11:28.228
I've come back.

01:11:29.738 --> 01:11:34.295
It never occurred to you that barging
in like this might be embarrassing?

01:11:35.838 --> 01:11:37.599
You understand what I'm saying?

01:11:43.071 --> 01:11:45.594
Your friend's not back yet.
Is that what you mean?

01:11:45.738 --> 01:11:47.226
That's not of your bus...

01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:49.564
Not in there. How many times?

01:11:52.638 --> 01:11:54.433
What's this?

01:11:54.572 --> 01:11:57.333
- An emerald.
- I can see it's an emerald. I'm not blind.

01:11:57.471 --> 01:11:59.937
What I mean is, who gave it to you?

01:12:00.071 --> 01:12:01.128
No one you know.

01:12:01.271 --> 01:12:03.567
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:05.830
Everyone admires it. Everywhere I go...

01:12:05.972 --> 01:12:08.028
That's enough.

01:12:11.905 --> 01:12:13.598
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

01:12:13.738 --> 01:12:15.636
Don't be ridiculous.

01:12:26.104 --> 01:12:28.003
Nounoune.

01:12:31.238 --> 01:12:33.466
Oh, Nounoune.

01:12:35.205 --> 01:12:36.831
Say you're sorry.

01:12:36.972 --> 01:12:38.631
Why should I?

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:41.329
It's that or leave the house.

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.665
- Sorry.
- I can't hear you.

01:12:44.805 --> 01:12:46.065
I'm sorry.

01:12:47.438 --> 01:12:49.301
That's better.

01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:52.266
What's the matter?

01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:54.163
What's happened?

01:12:54.305 --> 01:12:57.669
Nothing's happened.
I've come back, that's all.

01:13:00.772 --> 01:13:02.795
Nounoune.

01:13:14.872 --> 01:13:16.633
Shh.

01:13:21.838 --> 01:13:23.565
So, then...

01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:26.996
Do you love me?

01:13:27.138 --> 01:13:28.866
Yes.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.260
Yes.

01:13:31.405 --> 01:13:32.894
Yes.

01:13:44.138 --> 01:13:46.161
Do you have a lover?

01:13:48.371 --> 01:13:50.530
Do you or do you not have a lover?

01:13:50.672 --> 01:13:52.262
No.

01:13:53.238 --> 01:13:55.534
Except for you.

01:13:56.405 --> 01:13:58.633
I love you.

01:14:31.572 --> 01:14:33.435
You're awake.

01:14:33.572 --> 01:14:35.299
So are you.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.236
- What time is it?
- What difference does it make?

01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:41.360
I don't know yet.
- You're back.

01:14:44.371 --> 01:14:46.701
Tell me. Ahem.

01:14:47.971 --> 01:14:50.096
Uh, tomorrow...

01:14:50.238 --> 01:14:53.398
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

01:14:54.538 --> 01:14:56.197
Mm?

01:14:56.871 --> 01:15:00.031
We'll try to be as discrete as we can,

01:15:00.171 --> 01:15:04.160
causing as little scandal or suffering
as possible.

01:15:04.305 --> 01:15:08.032
We'd better go back down south
for a few months.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:12.035
Somewhere peaceful
so we can look at each other.

01:15:13.238 --> 01:15:17.193
You just go back to sleep
and leave it all to me.

01:15:29.938 --> 01:15:31.632
All right.

01:15:32.138 --> 01:15:33.865
Thank you.

01:15:35.338 --> 01:15:37.634
No, that's too late.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.470
Isn't there something earlier?

01:15:57.138 --> 01:16:00.468
Isn't there one at noon or 12:30?

01:16:02.738 --> 01:16:05.033
No, that's too early.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.298
All right, then.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:19.529
Two for 3:15, first class.

01:16:20.004 --> 01:16:21.493
Thank you.

01:16:41.238 --> 01:16:43.295
- More to eat?
- No, thanks.

01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:45.827
- Not hungry?
- Not really.

01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:47.130
Take your rhubarb pills.

01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:48.464
I wish you wouldn't fuss.

01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:55.428
We need to talk.

01:16:55.572 --> 01:16:58.060
Let's get it over with, shall we?

01:16:58.672 --> 01:17:00.729
You've come back,

01:17:01.071 --> 01:17:03.663
that's the important thing.

01:17:04.605 --> 01:17:07.798
How could I ever have thought
you were just like all the others?

01:17:07.938 --> 01:17:11.302
Why didn't I realize you were the one?

01:17:11.438 --> 01:17:12.801
The only one.

01:17:12.938 --> 01:17:15.836
The love that comes along only once.

01:17:19.771 --> 01:17:22.431
Now, let's be practical.

01:17:22.572 --> 01:17:25.697
Are you willing to leave
all the arrangements to me?

01:17:26.737 --> 01:17:29.965
Oh, how are we going
to let them know?

01:17:30.371 --> 01:17:33.166
A letter is probably the best way.

01:17:33.305 --> 01:17:35.793
Quite short and to the point,
I should think.

01:17:36.572 --> 01:17:37.901
I'll help you write it.

01:17:38.438 --> 01:17:40.461
We need to get some of your things
before we leave.

01:17:40.605 --> 01:17:41.968
I hope your mother will cooperate.

01:17:42.104 --> 01:17:44.070
Will you stop pulling at the skin
on your toe.

01:17:44.771 --> 01:17:47.862
That's the way
to get an ingrown toenail.

01:17:50.605 --> 01:17:53.503
Don't you have anything
to contribute to this discussion?

01:17:53.638 --> 01:17:55.069
You're like a 12-year-old.

01:17:55.205 --> 01:17:58.069
With you, Nounoune, I'm likely to stay
that way for the rest of my life.

01:17:59.438 --> 01:18:01.063
What do you mean?

01:18:01.205 --> 01:18:02.932
What I say.

01:18:03.071 --> 01:18:05.299
It's true, isn't it? You can't deny it.

01:18:06.804 --> 01:18:10.237
Most people would be pleased
to have the secret to eternal youth.

01:18:11.737 --> 01:18:13.431
Its part of your charm, stupid.

01:18:13.572 --> 01:18:15.595
I don't know why you're complaining
to me about it.

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:16.964
I'm complaining to you about it

01:18:17.104 --> 01:18:19.536
because if I am like a 12-year-old,
it's your fault.

01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:21.535
My fault?

01:18:23.038 --> 01:18:24.265
Oh, my poor Nounoune.

01:18:24.405 --> 01:18:25.598
I can do without your pity.

01:18:25.737 --> 01:18:28.363
What did you mean, my fault?

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.203
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

01:18:32.271 --> 01:18:35.169
It's just that, for me, you were always...

01:18:35.704 --> 01:18:37.670
I was always?

01:18:40.871 --> 01:18:44.497
You sound as if you're reading the eulogy
at my funeral.

01:18:53.305 --> 01:18:58.431
You think you can go on drifting back
and forth between Edmée and me?

01:18:59.737 --> 01:19:01.294
Is that what you have in mind?

01:19:05.938 --> 01:19:08.336
Well, if it is,

01:19:08.471 --> 01:19:12.426
you'll have to learn to look
a good deal less guilty than that.

01:19:12.971 --> 01:19:16.199
Unless she's a lot stupider
than I take her for.

01:19:16.338 --> 01:19:19.735
Or perhaps you think you can get your
mother to keep her under lock and key

01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:23.633
while you wander around
doing what you feel like.

01:19:24.305 --> 01:19:26.328
She's not gonna put up with it forever,
you know?

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.698
Don't forget,
she's Marie Laure's daughter.

01:19:28.837 --> 01:19:31.360
The poison's bound to come out
somehow or another.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.061
- She may be a...
- Stop it, Nounoune.

01:19:33.538 --> 01:19:36.003
I can't allow you to ruin my idea of you.

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.496
What?

01:19:37.637 --> 01:19:40.069
Talking like that,
you sound like my mother!

01:19:42.438 --> 01:19:44.301
Before I got married, you said to me:

01:19:44.438 --> 01:19:46.733
"Be kind to her, try not to let her suffer."

01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:49.429
That's what you're like.
You're a good person.

01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.664
Even last night you said
you hoped I hadn't done something cruel.

01:19:53.804 --> 01:19:55.895
You're above all that!

01:19:59.371 --> 01:20:01.337
Nounoune.

01:20:02.505 --> 01:20:04.834
That's why I've always loved you.

01:20:06.637 --> 01:20:08.126
Why did you come back?

01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:15.064
- I was just starting...
- Well, I wasn't.

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:17.995
Neither was I.

01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:23.531
I came back

01:20:24.205 --> 01:20:25.898
because I couldn't go on without you.

01:20:29.271 --> 01:20:33.635
You have no idea what my life's
been like these past few weeks.

01:20:34.737 --> 01:20:38.295
Now I know what it is to suffer
because of a woman.

01:20:40.871 --> 01:20:44.633
When I found out you were back,
I was so relieved.

01:20:44.771 --> 01:20:47.067
I thought I could go home.

01:20:47.205 --> 01:20:49.568
Everything would be all right.

01:20:50.537 --> 01:20:53.470
But all I could think about was...

01:20:54.305 --> 01:20:57.702
And then last night,
I came back here and...

01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:00.334
You came back here and...

01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:07.562
You found an old woman.

01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:19.498
Yes, you found an old woman.

01:21:20.904 --> 01:21:22.699
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

01:21:22.837 --> 01:21:25.894
I'm so grateful to you.

01:21:26.305 --> 01:21:27.793
Were you really in love with me?

01:21:27.938 --> 01:21:31.234
Did you really think
I was such a good person?

01:21:32.837 --> 01:21:35.598
If I had been a truly good person,
I'd have made a man of you

01:21:35.737 --> 01:21:40.669
instead of thinking of nothing
but your pleasure and my happiness.

01:21:41.871 --> 01:21:45.201
I wouldn't have kept you all to myself.

01:21:45.804 --> 01:21:47.929
Look at me.

01:21:52.671 --> 01:21:54.637
You're right.

01:21:55.271 --> 01:21:59.294
The qualities you lack,
I expect it is my fault.

01:21:59.437 --> 01:22:05.268
But 30 years of easy living
does make you very vulnerable.

01:22:06.704 --> 01:22:10.761
So no, I never did talk to you
about the future.

01:22:11.271 --> 01:22:13.169
Forgive me.

01:22:13.737 --> 01:22:17.226
I loved you as if we were going
to die the same day.

01:22:18.938 --> 01:22:22.461
I carried you in my heart
for such a long time.

01:22:23.737 --> 01:22:29.136
I forgot you were going to have
to carry your own burdens.

01:22:30.271 --> 01:22:32.532
A young wife.

01:22:33.338 --> 01:22:35.963
Perhaps even a child.

01:22:38.104 --> 01:22:39.933
And so

01:22:41.338 --> 01:22:43.565
you're going to suffer.

01:22:44.404 --> 01:22:46.734
You're going to miss me.

01:22:47.205 --> 01:22:52.694
And you're going to have
to try to find enough wisdom and tolerance

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:54.962
not to cause suffering to others.

01:22:59.238 --> 01:23:01.204
The thing is,

01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:05.425
now you've had a taste of youth.

01:23:06.404 --> 01:23:11.462
It's never satisfying,
but you'll always want to go back for more.

01:23:17.271 --> 01:23:19.328
You must go.

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:22.800
I love you.

01:23:22.938 --> 01:23:25.200
But it's too late.

01:23:28.038 --> 01:23:30.197
So get dressed.

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.565
And go away now.

01:24:22.804 --> 01:24:24.963
<i>Chéri felt capsized,</i>

01:24:25.104 --> 01:24:29.468
<i>as if he'd been present</i>
<i>at some irreversible catastrophe.</i>

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:39.803
<i>And, indeed, far sooner than he</i>
<i>or anyone else could have predicted,</i>

01:24:39.938 --> 01:24:43.301
<i>the belle époque itself</i>
<i>was swept away utterly by a war</i>

01:24:43.437 --> 01:24:47.733
<i>in which he fought</i>
<i>and from which he returned unharmed.</i>

01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:57.429
He's going to come back.

01:25:07.437 --> 01:25:10.335
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>he was unable to suppress a sense</i>

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:14.198
<i>that he had escaped from something,</i>
<i>that he was a free man again,</i>

01:25:14.337 --> 01:25:19.202
<i>a feeling he eventually came</i>
<i>to realize was entirely misguided.</i>

01:25:19.337 --> 01:25:21.599
<i>It was many years</i>
<i>before he understood</i>

01:25:21.737 --> 01:25:24.464
<i>that both of them</i>
<i>had been quite unjustly punished.</i>

01:25:24.604 --> 01:25:27.365
<i>Lea, for having been born</i>
<i>so many years before him.</i>

01:25:27.504 --> 01:25:29.527
<i>And Chéri, for having failed to grasp</i>

01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:34.262
<i>that Lea was the only woman</i>
<i>he would ever be able to love.</i>

01:25:40.704 --> 01:25:43.932
<i>And once he was settled in his mind</i>
<i>that this was the case,</i>

01:25:44.071 --> 01:25:46.434
<i>he looked out his old service revolver</i>

01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:49.230
<i>and put a bullet in his brain.</i>

01:26:49.231 --> 01:26:50.231
