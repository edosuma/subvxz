00:05.506 --> 00:06.666
What the hell
did you do to me?

00:06.757 --> 00:07.883
I could ask you
the same thing.

and you were gone.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.093
They blackmailed me
just like they're gonna
blackmail you.

For a man whose
campaign is founded
on sound family values,

00:16.767 --> 00:18.473
this could be really
embarrassing for you,

00:18.561 --> 00:19.926
especially
considering your wife.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.512
Two million dollars
makes me a candidate

like 20 times.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.449
That was attempt number six.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.034
It was in my backpack,
and now it's not.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.699
What?
It's gone.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.821
What do you mean,
it's gone?

00:36.913 --> 00:38.528

to find that tape.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.329
Dad, how did you
get out ofjail?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.202
I walked out
because I got a secret.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.703
MICAH:
Mom has a secret, too.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.922
What do you think
D.L. is gonna do when
he finds out what we've done?

00:47.006 --> 00:47.995
What we've done?

00:48.090 --> 00:49.125
We framed him.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.879
I'm taking Micah,

01:08.778 --> 01:10.234
What, a guy can't cook
dinner for his wife

01:10.321 --> 01:11.982
without being accused
of cheating on her?

01:12.073 --> 01:14.689
Well, you were missing

01:14.784 --> 01:17.742
I love you.
It's like you're in my head.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.654

01:43.020 --> 01:44.476
I think that's
a good bargain.

And what do you know?

all over the world,

everything would be okay.

it doesn't make any sense,

you were flying with him,

it was all going to be okay,

And she's not
coming back until
I take care of a few things.

42:00.102 --> 42:01.717
So, why don't you
tell me where you are,

42:01.812 --> 42:04.303
I'll come get you
and bring you home.

42:04.481 --> 42:06.096
Your mom needs you.

42:07.150 --> 42:10.688
I'm in a little motel. It's
right off the Interstate 14.

42:10.779 --> 42:13.270
It's called
the Little Field Motel.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.235
You talking to your mom?

42:19.329 --> 42:20.535
No.

42:20.664 --> 42:22.871
No, I'm just goofing around.

42:27.129 --> 42:28.994
Come on. We've got
some driving to do.

42:29.089 --> 42:32.377
MOH/NDER: They cannot fathom
how much you stand
to lose in failure.

42:32.467 --> 42:33.752
Micah?

42:34.136 --> 42:37.128
That you are
the instrument
of a flawless design,

42:38.515 --> 42:41.257
and all oflife
may hang in the balance.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.184
The hero learns quick/y
who can comprehend,

42:46.106 --> 42:48.518
and who merely
stands in your way.
