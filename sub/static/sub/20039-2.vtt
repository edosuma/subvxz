WEBVTT

00:06.467 --> 00:08.700
This may sound condescending,
but I think it's cute

00:08.767 --> 00:10.900
the way that Manolo has
taken Hector under his wing.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.433
I don't like the kid already.
He's too damn good looking.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.033
However, I do like
the new digs.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.667
Spanish style,
like yourself,

00:17.733 --> 00:20.033
but it's missing
something, George.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.433
Man, it's missing the kid.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.233
This house is so big,
it feels empty.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.200
You know, Cuba's
so far away and...

00:26.267 --> 00:29.800
Damn, George, now you got me
missing my kids. God!

00:29.867 --> 00:31.700
I thought you were gonna
take a trip and go see 'em.

00:31.767 --> 00:35.067
I was, but I realized
after you quit our job,

00:35.133 --> 00:37.200
I needed to find
a new one quickly.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.400
All right. Well, I'm
getting together with Olly

00:39.467 --> 00:41.000
to go over the new
one-hour show, so...

00:41.067 --> 00:44.133
So, I'ma stay here
and eat your food

00:44.200 --> 00:46.233
and order the UFC fight
on pay-per-view

00:46.300 --> 00:49.000
because you still
feel guilty about...

00:49.067 --> 00:50.533
Fair enough.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.533
**

00:59.400 --> 01:01.133
What are you really
feeling about it?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.433
It is exciting
going out on my own.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.267
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.500
Yes, you are,
because you just did.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.367
We go way back, so I'm gonna be
completely honest with you.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.900
Oh, please don't.
You were fired

01:11.967 --> 01:13.233
and only one client
came with you.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.433
Yeah, but that client
is George Lopez.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.067
I mean, perhaps
you've heard of him.

01:17.067 --> 01:20.400
Yes, and I've also heard that
he refuses to do the one thing

01:20.467 --> 01:23.133
people are willing
to pay him a fortune to do.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.300
Well, technically,
that's true.

01:24.367 --> 01:25.567
You still live at home.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.900
Yes, but have you
seen my Tesla?

01:27.967 --> 01:29.067
You're on
your mom's phone plan.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.600
Yes, because
I'm not an idiot.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.367
They don't make phone plans
like that anymore.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.200
Okay, this is all temporary.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.533
I believe you.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.167
Look, I don't know
how you do it,

01:38.233 --> 01:40.100
but you always seem to
end up on top of things.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.133
I think it's the combination
of a distant father

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400
and a not-distant-enough
mother.

01:44.467 --> 01:46.200
I always have
something to prove.

01:46.267 --> 01:50.267
Mmm. Oh.
No, no, no, no.

01:50.333 --> 01:54.233
Please. ABC has got this.
We've had a good pilot season.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.867
Well, if you insist.

01:55.933 --> 01:58.767
And I have something else
I need from ABC.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.333
A meeting for George.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.133
Ooh. You know,
sitcom season is over.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.500
I know we say we go
year-round, but...

02:04.567 --> 02:06.467
But it's not a sitcom
and it's really good

02:06.533 --> 02:09.433
and you won't regret it.
No.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
Come on, you know how good
George is in a room.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.733
Olly, I can't.
Well, you owe me.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.700
Remember Kevin?
You're pulling Kevin?

02:17.767 --> 02:21.667
Well, I'm pulling
whatever I have to pull.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.700
Fine.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.467
And at least one senior VP
is in the room.

02:27.533 --> 02:30.400
No.
Do you remember Kevin?

02:30.467 --> 02:33.233
Sure.
I'll tip.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.833
No. Okay.
Okay.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.700
No, you offered.
No, I, yeah,
no, it's fine, I'll...

02:38.767 --> 02:42.400
The prices went up here.
Thank you.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.733
You know, my new show
has to have a cool title.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.633
Like, something that tells
people that it's different,

02:47.700 --> 02:49.100
like, right away.

02:49.167 --> 02:52.067
How about "Mexican PI"?
No, dude.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.333
That's cheesy.
That's like '80s.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.067
Tom Selleck stuff.
I love Tom Selleck.

02:56.067 --> 02:58.567
If I owned my house,
I would do one of his
reverse mortgages.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.967
Or else, I like the guy
that sells the gold,

03:01.067 --> 03:02.600
the guy from
"Knots Landing."

03:02.667 --> 03:04.167
William Devane?
Oh, man! Hector!

03:04.233 --> 03:05.200
What the hell are you
doing back there?

03:05.267 --> 03:06.467
Hey, what's Hector
doing here?

03:06.533 --> 03:08.600
I told him to
come along, jefe.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.900
Hey, you can relax just by
listening to Mr. Lopez.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.500
Call me George but don't
jump out at me, dude.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.533
You scared the hell
out of me.
My bad, G.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.400
But hey, that new show
sounds amazing.
Oh, thanks.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.733
Huh? Isn't that a sitcom?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.367
No, dude, it's like
a gritty hour-long,

03:20.433 --> 03:22.433
you know,
but relevant to today.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.167
It kind of shows
a different side of me.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.433
It shows my acting chops

03:25.500 --> 03:27.933
like Bryan Cranston did
with "Breaking Bad."

03:28.067 --> 03:29.333
He was scary.
Yeah, right?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.067
He was scary
but he was sympathetic.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.367
That's the key.
Keep it real,

03:32.433 --> 03:34.400
and I want to do it
in the Valley.

03:34.467 --> 03:37.200
Wait a minute,
that could be the name, eh?

03:37.267 --> 03:41.100
Coming up next, "Valleys."
Huh?

03:41.167 --> 03:42.500
That's hot. "Valleys."

03:42.567 --> 03:45.467
I'll show Danny's dumb ass
who's relevant. "Valleys."

03:45.533 --> 03:47.400
So, George, look,
I know the new show

03:47.467 --> 03:49.467
is not a comedy or anything,
but how do you come up

03:49.533 --> 03:51.200
with all that crazy shit
you do, huh?

03:51.267 --> 03:53.567
Weed? La mota? Right?

03:53.633 --> 03:55.233
I don't know.
Not a lot.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.633
Just a little bit
and then staying hydrated.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.767
A lot of coconut water,
like that.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.767
Hey, jefe,
if it's cool with you,

04:08.833 --> 04:10.467
I was gonna go get
Hector settled in

04:10.533 --> 04:12.167
and come back when you
need me to pick you up.

04:12.233 --> 04:13.633
All right, that's cool.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.467
You know, he's a great kid
but he got off-track

04:15.533 --> 04:17.667
and he's got nobody.
Never had a dad around,

04:17.733 --> 04:19.500
just like us,
so in prison,

04:19.567 --> 04:21.433
we kind of had
each other's backs.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.300
Gotta help him out,
right? Give back.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.533
That's good, Manolo.
I like that.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.533
I'm proud of you, man.
Hey, Hector.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.200
Good to meet you, man.
I'm sure I'll see you around.

04:29.267 --> 04:32.067
Hey, and the weed is only like
10% of my funny, all right?

04:32.100 --> 04:36.267
So don't do drugs or
any of those bath salt stuff.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.900
He really is funny.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.567
Let me do it,
just organize it.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.067
All right.
Thank you so much.

04:43.100 --> 04:48.267
Hey, Olly, what's happening?
You still work here or what?

04:48.333 --> 04:52.200
Hey, listen, I think
I found the perfect
title for my new show.

04:52.267 --> 04:55.500
"Valleys." 'Cause it sets
a tone, you know?

04:55.567 --> 04:56.833
And because we're doing it
in the Valley,

04:56.900 --> 04:58.567
we can push up against
a lot of the stereotypes

04:58.633 --> 05:00.200
but it's really
about the lows.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.267
"Valleys."
Oh, I like it.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.067
Do you play a cop
or a PI?

05:05.067 --> 05:06.433
No, no, I'm an ex-cop

05:06.500 --> 05:08.067
and he's caught
in a web of corruption

05:08.100 --> 05:10.667
and because it's real,
we can shine a spotlight

05:10.733 --> 05:13.167
on the important issues
in the Latino community.
Hmm.

05:13.233 --> 05:14.733
Well, that's great,
and I have

05:14.800 --> 05:16.267
some other great news
for you.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.767
My law degree
finally proved useful.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.667
I got you out of
your Vegas contract.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.200
Wait a minute, you did?
No lawsuits?
Nope.

05:22.267 --> 05:23.700
Nope.
No damages?

05:23.767 --> 05:25.567
The only thing is,
you can't perform standup

05:25.633 --> 05:27.300
during the length
of the contract.

05:27.367 --> 05:30.867
Wait a minute,
I can't do standup?

05:30.933 --> 05:33.267
Well, you can if you
go back to Vegas.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.667
No, I don't want
to do that.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.667
Well, but I can do "Valleys,"
though, right?
Yep.

05:36.733 --> 05:39.700
I limited the non-compete
to the area you were hired--
standup.

05:39.767 --> 05:43.433
Yeah, okay. Yeah,
I can deal with that.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.567
Yeah, all right.
Good, 'cause I have some
other good news for you.

05:46.633 --> 05:48.700
What's that?
I got you a meeting at ABC

05:48.767 --> 05:51.533
to pitch your show,
"Valleys."
Wait a minute.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.067
ABC wants to hear "Valleys"?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.600
Oh, they were practically
begging for the meeting.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.300
They were?
Mm-hmm. All morning.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.667
Wow. Let's celebrate.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.533
What am I doing
drinking coffee?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.467
Hey, you got some
tequila back here?

06:02.533 --> 06:03.933
(whistling)

06:04.067 --> 06:06.767
I don't ever want room
for cream.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.433
You give me
all my damn coffee

06:08.500 --> 06:11.367
and I will drink it or I
will pour it in the trash.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.500
Just let me decide.
Here's how the companies
get you.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.133
What's that?
Oh, it's my first podcast.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.767
I have three hours.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.200
I was thinking
I should edit it,

06:19.267 --> 06:21.200
but it all sounds
pretty damn good.

06:21.267 --> 06:23.300
What up, G? Whoo!

06:23.367 --> 06:24.567
Love your
steam shower, man.

06:24.633 --> 06:25.767
The one in my room
doesn't have

06:25.833 --> 06:27.633
nearly as much
pressure or steam.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.200
You should probably
get that fixed.

06:29.267 --> 06:31.400
Your room?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.500
(George)
This ain't a hotel.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.600
I didn't think you
were charging him.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.067
Well, it's not
a flophouse, either.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.567
But you said that
we gotta help him.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.300
I was agreeing with you,
all right?

06:45.367 --> 06:46.400
You should be taking him
under your wing.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.833
He should be staying
with you.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.733
I don't have a wing.
I just got out of prison.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.167
I'm sorry if I messed up,
jefe,

06:52.233 --> 06:53.467
but Hector needs your help.

06:53.533 --> 06:54.833
If you put him
out on the street,

06:54.900 --> 06:56.467
he's just gonna go back
to his old ways.

06:56.533 --> 06:57.833
What do you mean, if I
put him out on the street?

06:57.900 --> 06:59.333
I just wanted him to
have a good influence,

06:59.400 --> 07:00.800
and you're the best
influence I know.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.867
Oh, that's right.
You were in prison.

07:02.933 --> 07:04.633
Damn! Damn!

07:04.700 --> 07:06.667
I'm just saying,
the kid needs your help,

07:06.733 --> 07:10.433
and you did say the place
has been empty since Erica left.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.567
(soccer game on TV)

07:27.633 --> 07:28.933
Buenas dias!
School's tomorrow.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.900
I'd better figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.933
Oh, yeah. Hey, I gotta
get you a backpack

07:33.067 --> 07:34.167
and some pencils

07:34.233 --> 07:36.767
and some of those
pudding cups for your lunch.

07:36.833 --> 07:41.467
sportscaster talking)

07:41.533 --> 07:44.500
Hey, Hector, you mind
turning the TV off?

07:44.567 --> 07:46.567
We're trying to work.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.767
(TV clicks off)

07:54.067 --> 07:55.600
Hey.

08:00.767 --> 08:02.900
Hey, what'd you do to get
thrown in jail, anyway?

08:02.967 --> 08:06.333
This last time?
Receiving stolen property.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.700
But it's not
what it sounds like.

08:07.767 --> 08:11.133
I was just holding
some stuff for Enrique.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.067
Hey, you know, Manolo,

08:14.100 --> 08:15.800
I was thinking about
a character for "Valleys."

08:15.867 --> 08:19.500
Remember that badass drug dealer
that lived off Glen Oaks?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.667
He had all the flashy cars
and he had those fine women?

08:21.733 --> 08:23.233
He owned that chop shop?

08:23.300 --> 08:26.200
The dude was, like, handsome
and scary but mysterious,

08:26.267 --> 08:28.733
like he had it all.
Oh, yeah, he was busted.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.100
No, he wasn't.
And then killed in prison

08:33.167 --> 08:34.800
after being raped in prison.

08:34.867 --> 08:37.633
Boy, I bet he wishes
he had stayed clean.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.800
No. All right,
then what about his sister?

08:39.867 --> 08:41.667
What about the sister who was
the brains of the operation?

08:41.733 --> 08:43.167
She was fine, man.
She was hot.

08:43.233 --> 08:46.233
Remember they found
that body under her house?

08:46.300 --> 08:47.767
(laughing)

08:54.567 --> 08:59.500
Hey, dude, we gotta
find you a job, man.
But I'm a felon.

08:59.567 --> 09:02.933
Well, I know a place
that that's the only
qualification you need.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.900
Okay, Hector,
I'm gonna get you set up

09:05.967 --> 09:07.967
and I gotta get out
of there. If I'm in there
for more than ten minutes,

09:08.067 --> 09:11.300
that fool will find
something for me to buy him.

09:11.367 --> 09:15.800
We hard.
We done killed people,
robbed people,

09:15.867 --> 09:18.233
committed acts of mayhem
on said people.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.067
But now we put
our energy into making

09:20.067 --> 09:22.233
some of the finest
baked goods we can offer

09:22.300 --> 09:23.933
so we can stay out of gangs
and make a new life.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.167
Listen, that's...
that's great, really great.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.767
So, you think you can
help my man Hector out?

09:27.833 --> 09:28.967
Of course, Mr. Lopez.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.533
We can put him
right to work.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.067
No, that's...
that's Hector right there.

09:34.067 --> 09:36.633
George Lopez.
(laughing)

09:36.700 --> 09:38.433
So glad that we could
finally help you out.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.567
(George)
Oh, thank you so much.

09:39.633 --> 09:40.767
We're gonna take
good care of Hector.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.500
It's the other one.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.767
That's the gangbanger?

09:44.833 --> 09:46.233
I'm in high school.

09:46.300 --> 09:49.333
(laughing)
George! Mucho gusto.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.100
Mucho gusto.
This is my wife Amanda.

09:51.167 --> 09:52.300
She's gonna be
helping out around here.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.667
Ah, that's great.

09:53.733 --> 09:55.967
So, listen, I gotta get him
back to science class.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.500
You've got some
rehabilitating to do.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.433
I got a network meeting,
so this better work.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.233
George, did I mention
that one of the ovens
went down, the big one?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.800
I'm on it.
Okay.

10:04.867 --> 10:07.900
So, now I'm buying an oven.
A big one.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.667
(George)
You know, the thing that
is great about this show

10:12.733 --> 10:16.933
is that it has a lot to
say, you know, through
the eyes of a Latino

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
who is part of the community
and who is removed from it

10:20.067 --> 10:24.933
but still very connected
to it, like two sides
of the Latino experience.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.233
That's great,
but what makes it current?
What makes it now?

10:32.733 --> 10:36.267
Um, uh, well, I think
what makes it now

10:36.333 --> 10:40.233
is that you will see that
it's going on currently

10:40.300 --> 10:42.100
and that it's happening now,

10:42.167 --> 10:44.700
so when you see the houses
and the cars and stuff,

10:44.767 --> 10:48.233
they'll know that it's,
like, from modern day.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.633
I think that what
Rachel is wondering

10:51.700 --> 10:53.933
is what makes it relevant?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.267
Ah, well, this doesn't
take place in Brooklyn.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.133
(laughing)
That's... okay.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.600
But it is about
a very underserved

11:02.667 --> 11:04.167
and very diverse
community.

11:04.233 --> 11:07.433
Diversity is very
important to us.
Yes.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.333
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.233
As do I, and it's great
that word is finally

11:12.300 --> 11:14.567
getting back to
the community about ABC.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.067
I mean,
it's why we're here.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.333
We love serving
underserved markets.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.733
It is a growth area.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.100
I guess all those years
of indifference

11:21.167 --> 11:24.367
are finally paying off.
(laughing)

11:24.433 --> 11:27.767
Exactly. That was one
lesson that we sure
learned in the election.

11:27.833 --> 11:32.400
There is a whole country out
there that many in Hollywood
know nothing about.

11:32.467 --> 11:36.167
That's why we have a new
hour-long in development
from Johnny Knoxville

11:36.233 --> 11:40.533
about a struggling,
working-class white family
from coal country.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.200
"The Deplorables."
Mm-hmm.

11:42.267 --> 11:46.133
That's just
our internal name for it.

11:51.300 --> 11:55.200
I like it, and coming
from you, it's very exciting.

11:55.267 --> 11:57.767
A Latino comedian bringing us
a gritty one-hour?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.233
(laughter)
It's so cool.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.433
Creative lines
are blurred these days.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.967
Look at "Transparent."

12:04.067 --> 12:07.067
It's a comedy,
but it's depressing,
and it's an hour.

12:07.067 --> 12:09.167
Actually,
it's a half-hour.

12:09.233 --> 12:13.167
Really? Huh.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.800
Well, who do you see
starring in "Valleys"?

12:15.867 --> 12:19.067
Oh, me. I mean,
that's the whole...

12:19.100 --> 12:22.400
that's the whole thing
about it.

12:24.933 --> 12:28.467
Oh, I thought you were
bringing the show in

12:28.533 --> 12:30.633
just as a producer.

12:30.700 --> 12:34.367
I didn't realize
you would even do TV.

12:34.433 --> 12:37.367
Well, you know, I have had
four television shows.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.300
Well, this is
a great opportunity.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.333
I think we should take this
right up with the group.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.567
No group, no group, no.
(clears throat)

12:52.633 --> 12:55.900
Sorry. No group
because if you're not
in love with this idea

12:55.967 --> 12:57.633
and if you don't
believe in George,

12:57.700 --> 12:59.600
then we want to
hear it now.

12:59.667 --> 13:04.567
We love George,
but we have many

13:04.633 --> 13:06.733
talent holding deals
to service.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.433
For instance,
we just signed Coco.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.733
(laughter)

13:11.800 --> 13:13.833
Coco, the transgender
Internet model?

13:13.900 --> 13:16.867
Yes. Coco is beautiful.
Gorgeous.

13:16.933 --> 13:19.133
Ravishing.
Stunning.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.433
And clearly relevant.
Yes.

13:22.500 --> 13:28.100
Yeah, no, listen, I...
I think Coco is great.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.067
Seriously, I was
thinking about having

13:30.067 --> 13:32.800
a transgender character
in "Valleys"

13:32.867 --> 13:36.067
who is the sister
of the drug kingpin

13:36.100 --> 13:38.600
and their relationship,
you know,

13:38.667 --> 13:40.067
growing up together
as boys,

13:40.067 --> 13:41.867
and then now
the tumultuous relationship

13:41.933 --> 13:43.800
between a sister
and brother,

13:43.867 --> 13:45.533
and I ran it by,
you know, Caitlyn Jenner.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.500
We were golfing.
I mentioned it to her
and she liked it,

13:47.567 --> 13:51.133
and then Chaz I saw
getting coffee,
and he responded,

13:51.200 --> 13:54.067
so, you know,
I think Coco is perfect.

13:54.133 --> 14:03.067
Coco as a Mexican PI.
It's sexy.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.867
I'm the Mexican.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.067
But Coco's role
would be very important.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.933
I mean, she's the co-star.
She's Coco the co-star,

14:12.067 --> 14:15.533
which sounds great
and is also very sexy.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.833
Coco did say that Coco was
interested in doing a winner.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.200
Then why don't we
run this by Coco?

14:21.267 --> 14:25.067
(laughing)
All right.
Great. Hey.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.867
When did they stop
using pronouns?

14:26.933 --> 14:29.100
These days,
they are a minefield.

14:31.167 --> 14:34.333
Damn, I keep messing up.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.900
Maybe if I stopped
looking at you

14:35.967 --> 14:37.067
and looked at the dough,

14:37.133 --> 14:38.933
I could finally
get this batch right.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.900
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.500
You girls are so pretty
and you can bake.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.633
I can't believe you were
accessories to murder.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.300
Hey, (bleep),
you dropped something.
Yo, what you doing?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.900
Leave him alone.
Hey, chill, boy.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.167
Don't let this hair
fool you, man.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.867
That's enough.
Come on, break it up.

14:54.933 --> 14:58.133
You, come with me.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.300
Oh, man, hey, it's all
coming together, brother.

15:07.367 --> 15:10.433
Look at my co-star
right there.
That's a man?

15:10.500 --> 15:15.067
Manolo, Coco is transgender.
So she's a woman?

15:15.067 --> 15:17.933
Yes.
Without a dick?

15:18.067 --> 15:20.667
Without a dick? No, man.
What the hell, dude?

15:20.733 --> 15:24.233
A he/she?
Serious, man,
that's-- that's...

15:24.300 --> 15:27.300
Listen, nobody talks
like that anymore, cochino.

15:27.367 --> 15:30.667
He/she. Look, it's not
what you have downstairs,
all right?

15:30.733 --> 15:32.200
It's what
you have upstairs.

15:32.267 --> 15:34.933
Oh, you mean...?
Manolo. Hey, come on,
man, serious.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.433
Get real, all right?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.600
Since you got cable, man,
you're a different person.

15:39.667 --> 15:43.300
(musical ringtone)
Hello?

15:43.367 --> 15:45.200
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm on my way.

15:45.267 --> 15:48.400
Hector.
Something went wrong.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.900
I didn't realize baking
bread would be so hard.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.733
When I cooked crack,
there wasn't all these
health rules.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
Are you serious?
I don't think that
was your issue.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.533
What happened with
Menendez and his wife?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.967
I don't know, G.
One minute, she was
giving me a massage,

16:03.067 --> 16:05.233
and the next thing
you know, all hell
broke loose.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.233
I can't be distracted
by this fool right now.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.333
You didn't do it
on purpose, right, Hector?

16:09.400 --> 16:13.767
Go wait in the car,
Hector.

16:13.833 --> 16:17.267
Listen, Manolo,
I'm at a crisis point
in my professional career.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.100
If this show doesn't work,
it could be

16:19.167 --> 16:20.733
all over for me, man.
I can't fail.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.800
You won't fail, jefe,
but he needs you.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.200
You need to help him out.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.767
I can't be distracted
by Hector, okay?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.633
So you need to help
him out and you need
to keep an eye...

16:27.700 --> 16:29.733
[tires squealing]

16:29.800 --> 16:33.067
How's that?
Hector stole my car.

16:33.100 --> 16:37.067
You don't steal
George Lopez' car--
any of 'em!

16:37.100 --> 16:38.400
What are you doing?
You calling the cops?

16:38.467 --> 16:40.433
You can't call the cops.
He'll go back to jail.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.900
It's grand theft auto.
Please, man.
He may never get out.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.800
You know what?
That's not my problem.

16:46.867 --> 16:50.133
Please, jefe.

16:50.200 --> 16:56.200
All right.
I got an app on my phone.
I can find my car.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.267
So if I get the car back
with no scratches, no dents,

16:58.333 --> 17:00.300
and no tickets,
I won't call the cops.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.500
You see that
red dot right there?

17:01.567 --> 17:02.967
That's the SUV.
That's pretty cool.

17:03.067 --> 17:05.867
It's not moving.
It says that it's right...

17:05.933 --> 17:08.367
It says
that it's right there.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.667
He's in there.

17:15.567 --> 17:19.933
Go talk to him.
What do you
want me to say?

17:20.067 --> 17:23.367
What's up, Hector?

17:23.433 --> 17:27.200
I'm sorry, George.
I just suck.

17:27.267 --> 17:31.067
I suck at being in
a gang, I suck at
staying out of one.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.167
The only thing I was
ever good at was prison,

17:33.233 --> 17:35.500
and because I was good,
they let me out early.

17:35.567 --> 17:39.600
Wow. Listen, Hector,
man, you don't want
to go back to jail.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.200
No, but I don't
always want to be
a screw-up, either.

17:42.267 --> 17:44.633
I don't know
what else to do.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.267
You know, my parents...

17:47.333 --> 17:49.167
I know, bro.
Mine too, mine too.

17:49.233 --> 17:52.500
Well, how'd you
figure it all out?
Well, here's the thing.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.700
I don't have it
all figured out, you know?

17:54.767 --> 17:58.567
When I was your age,
Hector, I just thought
I wanted to be somebody

17:58.633 --> 18:00.733
more than I wanted
to be nobody, you know?

18:00.800 --> 18:04.367
Just try to find a good
example and follow that.

18:04.433 --> 18:07.633
Yeah. Yeah, you are
a pretty good example.
No, man.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.067
Don't-- don't follow me.
Listen, we know

18:09.133 --> 18:10.800
you're not good at baking,
all right?

18:10.867 --> 18:13.667
So find something
you are good at
besides sitting in jail.

18:13.733 --> 18:16.400
You know, you can go
back to cooking rocks.

18:16.467 --> 18:17.933
Kidding.
Come on, man.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.133
Hop in the back seat.
Let's go home.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.800
Are you crying?

18:22.867 --> 18:24.367
Dude, why are you crying?

18:24.433 --> 18:25.933
I'm the one
who should be crying.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.567
I'm buying an oven.

18:27.633 --> 18:28.900
You still gotta
pay for it?

18:28.967 --> 18:30.067
I still gotta
pay for that oven.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.467
Come on, teardrops,
let's go.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.633
I'm trying to tune it.
Well, hurry up
and tune it.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.133
It sounds awful.
Come on, man,
get it together.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.167
There's an app.
You can do it on an app.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.533
(gasping)
Little Caesars?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.467
Well, I feel like
I'm back at college,

18:48.533 --> 18:51.067
except now I live at home.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.333
Instead of
doing homework,

18:52.400 --> 18:53.833
we used to just sit
around and theorize

18:53.900 --> 18:56.367
about how Julius Caesar
got into the pizza biz.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.900
What'd you come up with?
Mostly aqueducts.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.167
(laughing)

19:01.567 --> 19:05.067
What's up?
Oh, Olly,
this is Hector.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.433
He's gonna be
around a while.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.267
Oh, don't stop
chewing on my account.

19:09.333 --> 19:13.700
George, ABC is very
serious about "Valleys"
if Coco is in,

19:13.767 --> 19:15.300
so we have a meeting
set for tomorrow.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.633
Oh, my God.
That's great.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.100
Yes, but before
you meet with Coco,

19:18.167 --> 19:19.567
you will be meeting
with human resources

19:19.633 --> 19:22.733
to discuss guidelines
about how to talk to Coco.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.067
You're kidding.
Definitely
not kidding.

19:25.067 --> 19:28.133
You are cisgender,
and you have...
we all have a lot,

19:28.200 --> 19:29.833
but you have
a lot to learn.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.633
Cisgender? Is that
like a mean way to
refer to gay people?

19:32.700 --> 19:35.367
Wait. Cisgender
just means normal.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.567
Ooh, please don't
say the "N" word.
It's very offensive.

19:37.633 --> 19:39.933
What?
No, no, no.
Not that word.

19:40.067 --> 19:42.133
No, "normal." It's
a very offensive word.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.300
Not as offensive
as the real "N" word.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.400
Let's be clear on that,
okay?

19:47.467 --> 19:49.533
Just be careful, okay?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.733
Everything
is riding on this

19:51.800 --> 19:53.367
and you're walking
into a lion's den.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.533
Why are you being so dramatic?
I'm meeting an actress.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.300
Are you crazy?
Please don't talk
like that.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.800
You could get charged
with a hate crime.

19:58.867 --> 20:02.333
The meeting is tomorrow.
We have to practice, okay?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.633
How do you
practice for that?

20:06.833 --> 20:08.267
* Uh yeah yeah *

20:08.333 --> 20:10.367
* That's right
come on come on come on *

20:10.433 --> 20:12.433
* Uh yeah yeah *

20:12.500 --> 20:14.800
*Hey *
* Come on come on *

20:14.867 --> 20:18.800
**

20:23.267 --> 20:25.467
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:25.533 --> 20:27.600
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:27.667 --> 20:30.067
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:30.133 --> 20:33.233
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... **
