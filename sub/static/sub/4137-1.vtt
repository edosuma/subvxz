02:30.984 --> 02:32.529
Um, how long has it been?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.597
Uh...

02:33.621 --> 02:35.299
- High school?
- Yeah!

02:35.323 --> 02:37.667
Oh, it's been, like, a
million years since... prom!

02:37.691 --> 02:39.636
Uh, yeah!

02:39.660 --> 02:41.971
- Oh! No...
- Oh! No.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.906
- Yeah...
- Ugh.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.574
Ah, I can still see
your parents' faces

02:44.598 --> 02:45.609
when I opened that door.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.913
Yeah, well, I'm still seeing you

02:46.937 --> 02:48.345
in your shiny green tux.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.613
It was festive!

02:49.637 --> 02:51.348
It was pretty green.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.284
Well, I can still see you
at the top of the stairs.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.885
You had that sparkly dress
and your hair all...

02:55.909 --> 02:56.786
- whatever...
- Big. Really big.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.855
Whatever you call it,
with the flowers.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.557
You were the prettiest
girl I'd ever seen.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.859
Thanks.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.894
What happened to you? You
really let yourself go.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.330
Yeah.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.531
So I've heard all these
stories about you,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.299
just traveling, all
over the place.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.401
What are you doing
back here in the city?

03:11.425 --> 03:12.369
- You remember Teddy?
- Yeah.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.237
From high school?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.372
Teddy who sat behind
me in algebra?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.940
Yeah, so he sold
his tech company,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.804
and I'm house-sitting
while he's in California.

03:18.828 --> 03:21.345
Six months free rent,
plus valet parking.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.613
Then I find a place of my own.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.717
And I see, in the meantime,

03:24.741 --> 03:27.317
you're dealing in driftwood.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.852
Yes. Driftwood is
the new plywood.

03:28.876 --> 03:29.953
Is it?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.721
When they sell, I
do pretty well.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.989
These are really amazing.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.526
Thank you. And you're
running a corporate empire?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.527
No, still working for my dad

03:37.551 --> 03:38.662
at Mayfield's.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.829
Oh, I just bought
one of your spoons.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.897
Did you? Pasta? Salad?

03:40.921 --> 03:41.998
I have no idea,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.400
but it makes a
great minute-hand.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.535
- That is pasta...
- Salad? Pasta.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.870
It's pasta.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.438
What is this? A sundial?

03:48.462 --> 03:51.341
Yep. It's, uh, 7:30-ish.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.509
7:30.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.173
Well, that's... I mean,
it's really 7:20.

03:54.197 --> 03:55.345
Yeah, your watch says 7:30.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.049
I set it 10 minutes
early, so I'm not late.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.548
Why not 15?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.812
Because that would be neurotic?

03:59.836 --> 04:00.784
Mm. Funny.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.319
I'm gonna go,

04:02.343 --> 04:03.887
but would you like
to share contacts?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.323
I don't have a phone.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.024
- Okay...
- Anywhere.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.893
But if you got a pen,
I'll write it on my hand.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.595
- I definitely don't have a pen.
- Yes.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.859
Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

04:12.883 --> 04:14.364
Low tide all week.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.300
Great. I will see you tomorrow.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.302
- Alright.
- Behave yourself.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.036
No promises. Hey!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.962
Let me know how that
cheese thing turns out!

04:23.364 --> 04:25.375
Pasta!

04:25.399 --> 04:27.911
You're kidding me.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.347
Greetings. I'm Josie Mayfield.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.816
38 years ago, my father
founded Mayfield's

04:32.840 --> 04:34.918
right here in my
mother's kitchen.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.820
Since then, the name Mayfield's

04:36.844 --> 04:38.422
has been synonymous
with cookware,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.557
bakeware, wooden spoons...

04:40.581 --> 04:42.426
And this year, we are
thrilled to introduce

04:42.450 --> 04:44.060
our new Mayfield's tea line

04:44.084 --> 04:45.895
and lemon squeezer.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.930
Ouch!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.932
Uh... ha.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.434
Okay. Well.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.503
Obviously, we will reshoot
the lemon mishap,

04:53.527 --> 04:54.838
but you get the idea.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.702
And I look at this as a
two-pronged approach...

04:56.726 --> 04:58.074
We have a weekly video blog,

04:58.098 --> 04:59.809
and a way to introduce
our customers

04:59.833 --> 05:01.478
to new, exciting products.
Such as...

05:01.502 --> 05:03.380
The Mayfield's home sodamaker...

05:03.404 --> 05:05.081
For the serious soda aficionado.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.016
Mayfield's is about
coffee and tea, not soda.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.618
Yes, sir, I know,

05:08.642 --> 05:10.887
but the 18 to 49-year-old male
is not drinking earl grey

05:10.911 --> 05:12.622
while watching Monday
night football.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.757
Josie, do you know why.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.924
Mayfield's is still in business?

05:14.948 --> 05:15.859
Yes, because we stay the course

05:15.883 --> 05:17.661
and give the customers
what they expect.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.085
- Exactly.
- We're not growing, dad.

05:19.109 --> 05:20.730
We're not shrinking either.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.898
Fine. Alright.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.534
The reps are in. I
will handle them.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.118
Francis in accounting
just had her baby,

05:26.142 --> 05:27.637
so we sent her a very
nice gift basket

05:27.661 --> 05:28.861
with a Mayfield bottle-warmer.

05:28.885 --> 05:30.974
And the product testing
for the cheese-slicer.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.076
Is tomorrow, that does it.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.678
Not quite. You are coming home

05:34.702 --> 05:35.782
for the party this weekend?

05:35.806 --> 05:37.747
- Of course.
- Alone?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.682
No. I'm bringing Richard.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.816
Oh, I see.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.751
Daddy, what is wrong
with Richard?

05:41.775 --> 05:42.752
He's the perfect man.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.654
On paper, yes.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.523
He's... ambitious.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.657
You love ambitious.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.992
He talks too fast.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.494
Really?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.961
Alright, I don't know, exactly,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.863
but there's just
something about him.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.132
Fine. Is there anyone
I could bring home

05:56.156 --> 05:57.567
that you would approve of?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.561
I guess you're just
still my little girl.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.574
Janet, where are those reports?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.158
The client's been
waiting since Monday.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.945
Hey. What are you doing here?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.580
- I missed you.
- Mm-hmm?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.881
And?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.083
And I need five minutes
with your father.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.519
He's not returning my calls.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.720
Richard...

06:16.744 --> 06:18.455
I know, but this
client's a perfect fit.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.857
MBA from Penn, 10
years at P&G...

06:20.881 --> 06:22.125
He could run Mayfield's
foreign sales

06:22.149 --> 06:23.860
with his eyes closed,
and he speaks mandarin.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.994
Trust me... The only mandarin

06:25.018 --> 06:26.618
my father cares about
is "moo shoo pork."

06:26.642 --> 06:28.202
Just put us in a room.
You have his ear.

06:28.226 --> 06:29.098
I have his DNA.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.722
And you two have been
in a room together.

06:30.746 --> 06:33.202
It did not go well. I really
want him to like you.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.538
He will!

06:34.562 --> 06:36.806
No, he won't, if you
keep pitching him.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.642
Plus, he thinks
you're a fast-talker.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.843
What's wrong with talking fast?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.107
Fast-talkers are untrustworthy.

06:41.131 --> 06:42.331
I'll wear him down. You'll see.

06:42.355 --> 06:43.780
What, like water
erodes a mountain?

06:43.804 --> 06:44.748

Do you remember
what you were like

when you started the business?

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.938
You were so full of ideas!

Mayfield's was your idea.

There would be no Mayfield's,

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.514
if it was not for your kitchen.

Thank you.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.344
It was sort of fun

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:02.522
We were a team.

Oh, this probably isn't

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:13.566

about the business.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.936
Oh, no. I shouldn't say it.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.128
Of course, you should say it.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.407
Well...

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.143
I was thinking about
a line of dogware,

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.278
for the kitchen...
You know, plates,

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.280
bowls, et cetera.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.182

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.619
Yes! Yes, he did.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.221

you to my daughters...

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:38.491
Josie and Mindy.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:39.893
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:42.162

business, Joseph?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:44.898
Oh, could be better,
right, Josie?

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:47.033
Oh, it could be worse. We're
certainly not shrinking.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:49.069
The fact is, is that
we're not growing,

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:52.873
and, actually, Claire just
had a very interesting idea.

01:03:52.897 --> 01:03:53.806
I think that Mayfield's

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.877
is going to introduce
a line of dogware.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.078

Thank you, Richard.

acacia on our salad bowls,

Gridley is going to Puerto Rico

he's never been before,

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.798

him to crew on a boat.

01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:05.030
You knew?

I feel bad nonetheless.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:37.042
I can't.

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.466
You don't... You
don't want the job?

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:39.544
No. Okay.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.880
You and I don't make sense.

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:42.614
Maybe we do on paper,

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:44.283
I'm just...

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:46.551
I'm so sorry.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:47.619
I don't...

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:49.121
I don't understand.

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.280
Well, that's the problem.

01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.418
Is this about your little
high-school sweetheart?

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.364
You can't be serious
about Gridley!

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.433
I mean, the guy is
a complete loser.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:03.235
No, he's not.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:06.205
And I let him walk
away once before...

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.407
I can't do it again.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.465
Take my car.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.013
Jo...

01:21:14.037 --> 01:21:15.981
Josie!

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.482
You're going after Gridley!

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:19.418
Oh!

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:21.020
You go, girl.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.487
What?

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.180
I knew it!

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:26.358
Dad!

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.527
Huh?

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.295
Oh!

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:32.097
I-I...

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:34.699
Guess I have some
explaining to do.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.568
You certainly do!

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:39.104
How long have you
been able to speak?

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.008
I don't care! Oh... dad.

I didn't really think
it all the way through.

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.304
This weekend didn't turn out

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:47.272
like I thought it would.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.341
Nothing ever does.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.143
I have a confession
to make, too.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:52.711
What kind of confession?

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.113
I don't want Mr. Right.

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.239
- No?
- I want Mr. Wrong.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.145
Mr. Totally Wrong.
