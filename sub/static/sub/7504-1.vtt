00:28.861 --> 00:32.344
I got a star on my car
and one on my chest

00:32.354 --> 00:35.221
A gun on my hip
and the right to arrest

00:35.231 --> 00:38.588
I'm the guy who's the boss
on this highway

00:38.598 --> 00:41.437
So watch out what you're doin'
when you're drivin' my way

00:41.447 --> 00:44.315
If you break the law
you'll hear from me I know

00:44.325 --> 00:48.320
I'm working for the state
I'm the highway patrol

00:50.693 --> 00:53.725
Well, you know me when you see me
'cause my door's painted white

00:53.735 --> 00:57.053
My siren a-screamin'
and my flashin' red light

00:57.063 --> 00:59.807
I work all day
and I work all night

00:59.817 --> 01:02.724
Just to keep the law and order
tryin' to do what's right

01:02.734 --> 01:04.641
If I write you out a ticket

01:04.650 --> 01:06.559
Then you better drive slow

01:06.569 --> 01:10.394
I'm just a-doin' my job
I'm the highway patrol

01:11.846 --> 01:15.068
I'm the highway patrol
The highway patrol

01:15.078 --> 01:18.014
My hours are long
and my pay is low

01:18.090 --> 01:21.055
But I'll do my best
to keep you drivin' slow

01:21.065 --> 01:24.996
I'm just a-doin' my job
I'm the highway patrol

01:54.388 --> 01:58.887
[Male Narrating] Meet Charlie--
helpful dad, upstanding citizen...

01:58.897 --> 02:04.076
and an 18-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land.

02:04.086 --> 02:07.911
- [Whistling]
- the Rhode Island State Police.

02:12.087 --> 02:16.395
That's Charlie's home--
modest, like the man.

02:16.471 --> 02:18.858
Even though he lived
on the water,

02:18.868 --> 02:21.267
Charlie wasn't
much of a swimmer...

02:21.277 --> 02:24.403
which will come into play
a little later in our story.

02:24.413 --> 02:27.021
But I'm getting way ahead
of myself.

02:27.031 --> 02:32.758
You know, maybe it's best if we just
go back and begin at the beginning.

02:32.768 --> 02:36.595
As a young man, Charlie had the world
by its bootstraps.

02:36.605 --> 02:39.061
He was the best young trooper
on the force...

02:39.071 --> 02:42.418
and was dating the prettiest
and smartest gal in town.

02:42.428 --> 02:45.688
Her name was Layla,
just like the melody.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.866
Mmm, Charlie.

02:47.933 --> 02:50.993
You have no idea
how much I love you.

02:53.824 --> 02:56.673
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:56.740 --> 03:00.061
- Well, will you stay
with me no matter what?

03:00.071 --> 03:02.071
Of course, Charlie.

03:03.398 --> 03:06.908
Well, what if I had to move to the
Arctic, and you could never come home,

03:06.918 --> 03:09.143
and you had to eat whale blubber
for the rest of your life?

03:09.153 --> 03:13.233
- Would you still stay with me?
- Yeah, I'd stay.

03:15.944 --> 03:20.097
- But I hope that never happens.
- Yeah, me too.

03:20.164 --> 03:22.164
[Cheering]

03:24.395 --> 03:26.304
[Narrator]
Well, by spring time,

03:26.314 --> 03:28.222
they had made it official.

03:28.232 --> 03:30.146
Boy, let me tell you,

03:30.156 --> 03:32.066
that was some wedding.

03:32.076 --> 03:34.044
It was presided over
by Father Ken Gumbert,

03:34.054 --> 03:39.324
and half the Rhode Island
State Police Force was in attendance.

03:40.780 --> 03:44.860
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you, Captain.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.108
- [Engine Starts]
- [Cheering]

03:56.818 --> 03:58.818
[Laughing]

04:01.136 --> 04:03.136
- Ooh!
- All right.

04:06.123 --> 04:08.030
- Look what I got.
- Ooh!

04:08.040 --> 04:10.040
Whoo. Here we go.

04:11.658 --> 04:13.658
Ah.

04:17.423 --> 04:22.852
Oh, um, excuse me.
Do you people take checks?

04:22.929 --> 04:27.139
Say that again. Do we people
take checks? You mean, the black man?

04:27.149 --> 04:29.412
No, no, no, no, no.
God, no. Your company.

04:29.422 --> 04:32.617
Don't give me that backtracking
bullshit. That was a racist slur!

04:32.627 --> 04:34.824
No, it wasn't, really.
I-I would never--

04:34.834 --> 04:36.742
Tell you what!
I'll make it real easy for you.

04:36.752 --> 04:39.851
Why don't you just pay me
in cotton or a cartload of watermelons?

04:39.861 --> 04:42.890
Or how's about a couple
of them buckets of fried chicken?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.865
'Cause you know how we black people--
we just love fried chicken, Mr. Charlie.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.454
- Hey, no, come on now. Settle down.
- What's going on?

04:48.464 --> 04:51.299
This cat don't believe
a nigger knows how to cash a check.

04:51.309 --> 04:52.551
Ain't that about a bitch!

04:52.561 --> 04:55.754
Charlie, I don't wanna ever hear you
use the "N" word in this house.

04:55.764 --> 04:59.891
What? I-- I never said
anything remotely racist.

04:59.958 --> 05:03.318
- Oh, so it's
the little people thing then?

05:03.328 --> 05:03.564
No!

05:03.574 --> 05:06.440
You think just 'cause I'm small,
you can just push me around?

05:06.450 --> 05:08.369
Well, come on, my friend,
let's boogie.

05:08.379 --> 05:11.353
- I'm gonna give you a little
lesson in low center of gravity.

05:11.363 --> 05:11.602
What?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.904
- [Grunting]
- Hey, whoa, hey, stop it!

05:13.914 --> 05:16.782
Hey! Cut it--
Stop it now. Sir!

05:16.859 --> 05:19.371
Don't patronize me
with that "sir" crap.

05:19.381 --> 05:21.357
- Whoa, hey, those are illegal.
- [Gasping]

05:21.367 --> 05:24.186
Stop. Oh, God! Ow!

05:26.365 --> 05:29.203
- Oh, it's on now! It's on.
- Charlie!

05:29.213 --> 05:31.794
[Groaning]

05:31.871 --> 05:34.479
- Charlie, don't hit him!
- [Screaming]

05:34.489 --> 05:37.272
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, stop it!
Charlie, stop it!

05:37.282 --> 05:41.522
Charlie, Charlie. Hey, hey, hey,
just let me handle this. Stop it!

05:41.532 --> 05:45.175
Excuse me, Mister, um,
"Jackson"--

05:45.252 --> 05:49.952
Uh-- Oh, stop it!
What-What-What is your first name?

05:50.019 --> 05:52.505
- It's Shonte.
- [Growling]

05:52.582 --> 05:57.311
Shonte, I'm-- I am--
I am so, so sorry. I apologize.

05:57.378 --> 06:01.146
Oh, come on, here.
Let me walk you to your car.

06:01.156 --> 06:04.150
I just don't have the patience for
people who judge books by their cover.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.077
And you shouldn't have to.

06:06.087 --> 06:09.656
Treating me like a dumbshit. I mean,
who does he think he's talking to?

06:09.666 --> 06:12.408
I'm a tenured professor
of molecular genetics over at Brown,

06:12.418 --> 06:15.241
- and I'm head
of the Boston chapter of MENSA.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.189
You're kidding?

06:16.199 --> 06:21.599
No. I'm just driving this limo
as a sociologic experiment, that's it.

06:21.609 --> 06:25.879
- But MENSA? I'm president
of the Providence chapter.

06:25.889 --> 06:26.845
No kidding.

06:26.855 --> 06:28.855
[Chuckling]

06:32.841 --> 06:36.870
[Narrator]Just when Charlie thought
life couldn't get any sweeter,

06:36.880 --> 06:40.965
old Mr. Stork dropped in
to pay him and Layla a visit.

06:40.975 --> 06:45.283
- [Groaning, Screaming]
- It's a boy!

06:45.359 --> 06:48.142
Oh, boy, oy, oy.

06:50.866 --> 06:52.866
Wow!

06:53.744 --> 06:58.530
He's so-- Wow!

06:58.607 --> 07:02.607
- [Panting]
- Huh? What?

07:02.674 --> 07:05.789
- [Screaming]
- Whoa, oh, my God, we're in luck.

07:05.799 --> 07:06.923
He's got company!

07:06.933 --> 07:10.060
- [Both Screaming]
- Push! Push!

07:11.346 --> 07:13.514
[Narrator]
Charlie loved those boys so much,

07:13.524 --> 07:15.566
he just couldn't face
the truth.

07:15.576 --> 07:20.676
And so he went on with his life,
as if everything was normal.

07:21.946 --> 07:24.756
Hey, Finneran.
Hey, Buddy.

07:24.823 --> 07:27.557
- Hey! Hope you brought
your appetite with ya.

07:27.567 --> 07:28.171
Oh, I did.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.377
- Ahh!
- Charlie, your kids look great.

07:30.387 --> 07:33.447
- Yeah, don't they? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

07:36.124 --> 07:38.124
- Charlie,
- [Screams]

07:38.167 --> 07:40.306
just between you and me,

07:40.382 --> 07:44.430
did you ever notice that your kids have
sort of a year-round tan?

07:44.440 --> 07:47.030
Yeah, well, uh--

07:47.097 --> 07:49.744
- My great grandmother's half Italian.
- Half Italian?

07:49.754 --> 07:51.668
Oh, yeah.

07:51.678 --> 07:55.031
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off their hair, huh?

07:55.041 --> 07:57.821
[Sighs]
Yeah, so?

07:57.888 --> 08:01.836
- I mean, a lot of people have
different kind of hair.

08:01.846 --> 08:02.512
Oh, yeah.

08:02.522 --> 08:05.303
I mean, what are you--
what are you-- what are you getting at?

08:05.313 --> 08:08.543
No, no, I'm just saying is--
You know--

08:08.575 --> 08:10.579
Come on, Charlie,
goddamn it!

08:10.589 --> 08:13.016
Those kids' dicks are bigger
than them sausages.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.251
Knock it off, Finneran. Those are
my children you're talking about.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.930
- I've been meaning
to ask you about that.

08:17.940 --> 08:18.522
Finneran!

08:18.532 --> 08:20.997
Get over here.
It's your turn.

08:25.669 --> 08:28.537
Charlie, don't mind me.

08:28.614 --> 08:30.551
It's j-just the beer talking,
you know? Whoo!

08:30.561 --> 08:33.534
Hmm. Sure.

08:40.327 --> 08:45.726
[Charlie] There's something powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father,

08:45.736 --> 08:48.672
and I'm afraid that someday,

08:51.338 --> 08:54.984
if I don't do something,
I'm gonna explode.

08:55.051 --> 08:59.560
[Sighs] Where does this rage
come from, my son?

08:59.627 --> 09:03.886
I don't know.
It's a lot of things, really.

09:03.953 --> 09:06.082
Take my wife, for example.

09:06.092 --> 09:08.366
I love her like no other,

09:08.433 --> 09:12.001
but part of me suspects
that she may be having an affair.

09:12.011 --> 09:15.330
And I'm-I'm probably
just being paranoid here,

09:15.340 --> 09:17.613
but I get the feeling...

09:17.680 --> 09:22.185
that the entire town is
laughing at me behind my back.

09:23.379 --> 09:26.727
Charlie, that you?

09:26.804 --> 09:30.600
[Narrator] Eventually,
Charlie's worst fears were realized.

09:30.610 --> 09:35.944
I'm so sorry, Charlie.
Really, I am.

09:36.021 --> 09:40.971
But I have to do this.
I found my soul mate.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.048
But...
[Exhales]

09:43.062 --> 09:45.451
I thought I was your soul mate.

09:45.461 --> 09:47.461
Tsk. Oh.

09:47.513 --> 09:50.362
Come on, legs.
Let's roll, baby.

09:52.185 --> 09:54.832
I don't know what to say.

09:54.908 --> 09:59.073
I guess the heart just wants
what the heart wants.

10:00.348 --> 10:02.348
Bye, Charlie.

10:04.089 --> 10:05.997
But you said
you'd eat whale blubber.

10:06.007 --> 10:11.872
Oh, she'll be eating blubber,
all right, just as soon as I free willy.

10:19.677 --> 10:22.497
- [Groaning]
- [Engine Starts]

10:25.155 --> 10:29.912
[Narrator] It's funny how a man
reacts when his heart gets broken.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.501
Some break down
and cry like a baby.

10:32.511 --> 10:35.610
Others, they take out an Uzi
and climb a clock tower.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.746
But Charlie Bailey gates
didn't seem to react at all.

10:38.756 --> 10:40.670
He just swallowed hard,

10:40.680 --> 10:44.539
felt that slab of heartache
slide over the lump in this throat,

10:44.549 --> 10:46.881
and he locked it all away.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.623
As you can imagine,
it wasn't easy...

10:53.633 --> 10:57.049
for little Jamaal,
Lee Harvey and Shonte Junior...

10:57.059 --> 10:58.977
growing up without a mom,

10:58.987 --> 11:04.377
but Charlie made that little house into
a big old home, and the boys flourished.

11:04.387 --> 11:07.418
Let me tell you,
they were smart ones.

11:07.428 --> 11:11.198
- What are you buildin', fellas?
- An airplane, Daddy.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.502
[Imitating Airplane Engine]

11:13.512 --> 11:17.059
- [Laughing]
- Bye-bye!

11:17.127 --> 11:20.406
- [All] Bye, Daddy!
- Have a good time at work!

11:20.416 --> 11:22.416
Bye, Daddy!

11:23.650 --> 11:25.562
Love you, Daddy!

11:25.572 --> 11:28.148
Where he can't hide

11:28.225 --> 11:31.803
-From himself
- No. No!

11:31.871 --> 11:37.213
Hey! Stop it! Jamaal, you're
in a lot of trouble! Get off that!

11:37.280 --> 11:39.575
Don't you take off in that!

11:41.030 --> 11:44.174
-How many seas
must a white dove sail

11:44.184 --> 11:45.463
Shonte Junior,

11:45.473 --> 11:48.253
How can you keep eatin' that crap
and never gain weight?

11:48.263 --> 11:51.486
- I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.
- [Chuckles]

11:51.496 --> 11:53.885
How many times

11:53.962 --> 11:57.035
-Must the cannonballs fly
- Do you believe his voice?

11:57.045 --> 11:58.104
That's Gomer Pyle!

11:58.114 --> 12:01.665
Before they're
forever banned

12:01.732 --> 12:04.247
- The answer, my friend
- Daddy, can we watch

12:04.257 --> 12:05.626
Richard Pryor on H.B.O.?

12:05.636 --> 12:07.842
-Is blowing in the wind
- Richard Pryor?

12:07.852 --> 12:11.018
- Please.
- Okay.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.940
In Africa, though,
I go out

12:14.950 --> 12:16.226
in the country. Whoo!

12:16.236 --> 12:20.197
You see some lions and shit.
I'm talkin' about real lions,

12:20.207 --> 12:23.842
not them kind you be
fuckin' with in the zoo.

12:23.852 --> 12:28.102
You fuck with the lions,
"Hey, lion, motherfucker!"

12:28.591 --> 12:31.679
Be throwin' shit at it.
Lion be, "Uh-oh, oh!"

12:31.689 --> 12:34.630
[Narrator] As they have
a way of doing, the years

12:34.640 --> 12:36.294
passed some what regularly.

12:36.304 --> 12:40.170
And the boys, well,
they came into their own.

12:40.237 --> 12:44.486
...is make her
toss my salad!

12:44.563 --> 12:47.527
The guy's like, "Toss my salad?
W-Well, what's that?"

12:47.537 --> 12:49.580
Yeah, well,
having your salad tossed...

12:49.590 --> 12:53.482
means having your asshole
eaten out with jelly or syrup.

12:53.492 --> 12:55.492
I prefer syrup.

12:56.371 --> 12:58.827
He's a funny motherfucker.

13:03.221 --> 13:06.318
[Narrator] Although Charlie's
police work had started to suffer,

13:06.328 --> 13:08.237
the kids were doing great.

13:08.247 --> 13:13.513
Damn! I can't figure out the atomic
mass of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.977
Shit, man,
that shit's simple.

13:15.987 --> 13:19.373
- Look. Tell me this, tell me this.
- What, what?

13:19.383 --> 13:23.441
- What's a deuteron made up of?
- Duh, a proton and a neutron.

13:23.451 --> 13:27.509
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

13:27.519 --> 13:31.182
- Shit, I don't know.
- Well, get it outta there then!

13:31.192 --> 13:33.671
Okay, so you sayin' I add up
the atomic masses of the proton

13:33.681 --> 13:34.645
and the neutron, right?

13:34.655 --> 13:36.254
- Mm-hmm.
- I sees that, but what do I do

13:36.264 --> 13:37.302
with the goddamn electron?

13:37.312 --> 13:39.220
Can I bring it over here?

13:39.230 --> 13:41.552
Enrico Fermi would roll over
in his motherfuckin' grave

13:41.562 --> 13:42.809
if he heard that stupid shit.

13:42.819 --> 13:45.427
I mean, he'd just turn over ass up
in your face. He wouldn't give a fuck.

13:45.437 --> 13:47.442
Man,Jamaal, man,
just cut my man some slack, dog.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.376
Look here, I'm just try
in'

13:48.386 --> 13:49.561
to help him save face, all right?

13:49.571 --> 13:52.467
He keep askin' questions like that,
motherfuckers gonna think he's stupid.

13:52.477 --> 13:54.387
- I ain't stupid.
- Mornin', fellas.

13:54.397 --> 13:57.236
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Hey, Pops, how you doin', man?

13:57.246 --> 14:00.565
- What's all the commotion down here?
-Just school shit and shit.

14:00.575 --> 14:03.331
- How's my little guy doin'?
- Strugglin'. This quantum

14:03.341 --> 14:04.411
physics is confusing.

14:04.421 --> 14:07.544
- If I don't buckle down,
I'm gonna get myself another B-plus.

14:07.554 --> 14:08.573
Oh, that'd be whack.

14:08.583 --> 14:12.315
Man, he so fuckin' dumb,
he think calculus is a goddamn emperor.

14:12.325 --> 14:15.388
- Give it up, dog.
- Well, you think polypeptide's

14:15.398 --> 14:17.082
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

14:17.092 --> 14:21.725
Oh, I gotta get outta here.
I don't want to have to bust a cap.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.124
Kisses.

14:24.201 --> 14:26.466
Mm, Daddy.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.694
- See ya later.
- Love

14:27.704 --> 14:28.478
ya! All right.

14:28.488 --> 14:33.409
[Narrator] Yeah, Charlie was gettin'
a lot of respect inside the house,

14:33.419 --> 14:37.860
but outside--
well, that was another story.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.653
Mornin', Ed.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.435
Charlie.

14:46.502 --> 14:49.055
Say, Ed, did you see
where my paper went today?

14:49.065 --> 14:52.125
Uh, the wife's got it
in the shitter.

14:53.323 --> 14:57.984
Well, could you tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

14:57.994 --> 15:00.204
Can't you get one at work?

15:04.173 --> 15:07.896
Yeah, I
...suppose I could.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.905
You betcha.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.255
I'd like that

15:22.322 --> 15:26.696
If we could cycle
down some lane

15:26.772 --> 15:30.322
I'd like that

15:30.389 --> 15:34.062
If we could ride
into the rain

15:34.129 --> 15:36.241
No mess getting wet

15:36.308 --> 15:38.764
I'd be your Albert

15:38.840 --> 15:42.189
If you'd be Victoria

15:42.265 --> 15:45.391
Ha, ha
We'd laugh because

15:45.468 --> 15:50.073
Each drop would make me
grow up really high

15:50.140 --> 15:54.102
Really high like a really high thing
say a sun flower

15:54.112 --> 15:56.913
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, George, Herb.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.089
- Hi, Charlie.
- How do, fellas?

15:59.099 --> 16:01.239
- Hi, Charlie.
- Listen, Dick, I was--

16:01.249 --> 16:05.105
Hey, guys, check out
the rack on this one.

16:05.182 --> 16:07.182
Whoa!

16:07.235 --> 16:09.488
Oh, yeah,
that's what daddy likes.

16:09.498 --> 16:11.801
It looks like a dead heat
in a zeppelin race.

16:11.811 --> 16:15.158
- Yeah, a couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
- Oh, the humanity!

16:15.168 --> 16:18.568
Come on, guys, take it easy.
She's a mom.

16:21.537 --> 16:24.021
[Laughing]

16:25.248 --> 16:27.248
"She's a mom."

16:29.345 --> 16:32.660
- She's not my mom!
- She's a yummy mom.

16:35.781 --> 16:38.331
- You kill me!
- "She's a mom."

16:43.877 --> 16:48.578
Sure, that is good.
Oh.

16:48.646 --> 16:52.347
Listen, uh, Dick, I'm sorry,
uh, to bother you like this,

16:52.357 --> 16:57.181
but, uh, uh, your-your-your car
is gonna have to be moved.

16:57.191 --> 16:59.772
[Chuckling]
Yeah, sure, Charlie, okay.

16:59.782 --> 17:04.060
I should be done here
in another ten or fifteen minutes.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.880
You know,
I hate to be a stickler, Dick,

17:06.890 --> 17:09.086
but, uh, the law states that you can't
park in one place for more than an hour,

17:09.096 --> 17:12.550
and you've been there for--

17:12.617 --> 17:14.689
goin' on three days now.

17:16.079 --> 17:20.040
All right, all right,
the law's the law.

17:20.108 --> 17:24.358
Park it behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

17:26.708 --> 17:29.040
Yeah, sure.

17:30.804 --> 17:34.055
- This one?
- [Narrator] There's an old saying.

17:34.065 --> 17:37.359
- An ostrich with his head
in the sand makes a lousy cop.

17:37.369 --> 17:37.893
My fault.

17:37.903 --> 17:40.684
You see, if you can't deal
with your own problems,

17:40.694 --> 17:43.494
- well, it's hard to deal with others'.
- Sweetie.

17:43.504 --> 17:46.287
Sweetie?
That's kind of dangerous.

17:46.297 --> 17:49.068
You wanna move it up onto the sidewalk,
away from the traffic?

17:49.078 --> 17:54.056
My dad says you're a joke,
and I don't have to listen to you.

17:54.066 --> 17:56.109
[Sighs]

17:56.186 --> 17:59.976
Well, your father
is entitled to his opinion,

18:00.052 --> 18:02.987
but I am an officer of the law,
and, uh, by all rights, I--

18:02.997 --> 18:06.532
- Fuck off!
- You should watch your mouth,

18:06.542 --> 18:07.629
little girl.

18:07.639 --> 18:11.535
[Screaming]

18:14.872 --> 18:17.762
[Woman]
Thank you, have a nice day.

18:18.873 --> 18:21.591
- Excuse me. Charlie! Hey!
- Hey.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.985
You mind if I get ahead of you?
I'm in a wicked rush. Is that okay?

18:23.995 --> 18:26.000
- Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead.
- You're a doll.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.983
- Aw.
- Hey, kids, over here! Now!

18:31.036 --> 18:34.874
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?
Stop! Put those down!

18:34.884 --> 18:37.694
[Drums]

18:44.350 --> 18:48.351
Nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah
We're gonna rock you

18:51.813 --> 18:53.813
[Groaning]

18:58.912 --> 19:00.912
[Exhales]

19:02.116 --> 19:05.253
-[Stops]
- [Chattering]

19:15.949 --> 19:19.210
"VagiClean," huh?
What's the matter, honey?

19:19.220 --> 19:21.855
Little extra cheese
on the taco?

19:23.153 --> 19:25.533
- Excuse me.
- No, excuse me.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.634
There's no tag on this.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.716
Price check on VagiClean,
aisle five.

19:32.726 --> 19:37.867
I repeat. Price check on VagiClean,
aisle five. That's VagiClean.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.528
We got a customer down here
with a full-on fallopian fungus.

19:40.538 --> 19:41.839
She's baking a loaf of bread,

19:41.849 --> 19:44.553
and I think it's sourdough.
[Inhales]

19:44.563 --> 19:46.414
[Gasps]

19:46.424 --> 19:49.455
Put a rush on that.

19:51.193 --> 19:53.234
Hey, big guy,
did you hear the news?

19:53.244 --> 19:56.468
My son, Billy, got the lead
in the high school musical.

19:56.478 --> 19:59.963
Well, I guess he likes
the cock after all.

20:01.216 --> 20:02.644
Wha--

20:02.654 --> 20:04.659
[Muffled Screams]

20:04.736 --> 20:08.987
- [Whistling]
-I'm basically no good

20:09.054 --> 20:11.576
Still wanna skip rope
on the street?

20:11.586 --> 20:13.648
I'm gonna tell my daddy
on you, Charlie!

20:13.658 --> 20:16.497
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

20:16.507 --> 20:20.027
[Continues Whistling]

20:20.094 --> 20:24.027
And I'm not fit to touch

20:24.094 --> 20:26.874
- The hem of your garment
- [Whistling]

20:26.884 --> 20:29.340
And no, no

20:29.408 --> 20:31.546
I'm not fit to touch

20:31.614 --> 20:35.807
The hem of your garment

20:35.874 --> 20:38.877
- [Baby Crying]
- [Gasps]

20:40.449 --> 20:42.362
[Growling]

20:42.372 --> 20:44.699
- [Crying Continues]
- [Continues Gasping]

20:44.709 --> 20:46.684
[Slurping]

20:46.694 --> 20:48.997
[Continues, Indistinct]

20:51.586 --> 20:54.148
- [Men Screaming]
- [Yells]

21:01.870 --> 21:03.870
There you go, Dick.

21:03.913 --> 21:07.971
I parked it for ya.
By the way,

21:10.281 --> 21:12.321
you got a headlight out.

21:15.885 --> 21:17.629
Yeah

21:17.639 --> 21:21.189
Oh, no

21:21.265 --> 21:24.296
All right

21:27.243 --> 21:29.243
[Continues]

21:33.650 --> 21:35.650
[Woman Screams]

21:47.799 --> 21:50.254
[Grunting]

21:50.322 --> 21:53.228
[Grunting Continues]

21:53.304 --> 21:57.162
- Mm-mm, that looks good.
- Here you go, Colonel.

21:57.172 --> 21:59.637
Very good, Malcolm.
Thank you.

21:59.675 --> 22:01.968
Colonel, we got a problem.
There's something wrong with Charlie.

22:01.978 --> 22:03.405
- [Dispatcher] One-X to 112.
- 1 1 2 responding.

22:03.415 --> 22:07.186
- [Dispatcher] One-X to 112.
- 1 1 2 responding.

22:07.196 --> 22:09.747
[Narrator] Of course, there's
not much about this sort of thing...

22:09.757 --> 22:12.307
in the Rhode Island
State Police manual,

22:12.317 --> 22:16.788
so they sent him up to Boston to see
a team of highly trained head doctors.

22:16.798 --> 22:19.472
They quickly identified
the problem.

22:19.482 --> 22:21.516
You got a major screw loose.

22:21.526 --> 22:23.444
Huh?

22:23.454 --> 22:27.984
- Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a split personality.

22:27.994 --> 22:28.692
A schizo.

22:28.702 --> 22:31.925
- I-I don't remember any of this.
- That's because...

22:31.935 --> 22:35.637
according to that report, it wasn't you
that this was happening to.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.554
- It was this other guy.
- Hank.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.087
- Huh?
- He said his name was Hank.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.120
- And apparently Hank is
trying to get out.

22:42.130 --> 22:42.993
Trying to get out?

22:43.003 --> 22:45.719
What do you mean, "get out"?
How did he get in?

22:45.729 --> 22:47.992
- You created him.
- By not dealing with

22:48.002 --> 22:49.335
your problems, Charlie.

22:49.345 --> 22:52.193
[Inhales Deeply]
Ever since, uh--

22:52.260 --> 22:53.881
[Stammering]

22:53.891 --> 22:58.237
Well, you know, you've been
avoiding confrontation.

22:58.304 --> 23:01.874
- But this guy inside-- he doesn't.
- Hank.

23:01.892 --> 23:05.718
Doctors feel that, uh, you've created
this character out of necessity.

23:05.728 --> 23:07.647
You never stick up
for yourself.

23:07.657 --> 23:10.111
- [Sighs]
- Charlie,

23:10.179 --> 23:14.089
why didn't you take
a vacation when Layla left?

23:17.067 --> 23:19.580
Why would I?
You know?

23:19.657 --> 23:23.743
I mean, wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

23:23.753 --> 23:26.237
There's no reason
to shortchange the department.

23:26.247 --> 23:29.987
I mean, it's not like I had the flu.
[Crying]

23:32.137 --> 23:35.398
[Sniffling, Sighing]

23:36.943 --> 23:38.852
Have you picked up
your medication, Charlie?

23:38.862 --> 23:41.193
[Crying Continues]
Mm-hmm.

23:43.437 --> 23:47.745
[Sighs]
I'm really not crazy about it, though.

23:47.822 --> 23:49.729
You know,
it makes me so dry.

23:49.739 --> 23:52.330
You have to take it anyway.
Dr. Rabinowitz assure us...

23:52.340 --> 23:54.247
that if you do,
everything'll be fine.

23:54.257 --> 23:56.713
[Woman]
This is a bunch of crap!

23:56.723 --> 24:00.234
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

24:00.244 --> 24:02.470
It shouldn't even be a state. It should
be the District of Rhode Island.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.644
- Whatever you say.
- Can you take these

24:04.654 --> 24:06.153
goddamn things off, please?

24:06.163 --> 24:09.223
And could you stop
looking at my ass?

24:09.874 --> 24:12.070
Pritchard, what--
what's going on out here?

24:12.080 --> 24:14.344
Well, Colonel, her name's
Waters, Irene P.

24:14.354 --> 24:18.574
I pulled her over on 95
for a broken tail light. I ran a check.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.973
She's got an outstanding warrant
in up state New York.

24:20.983 --> 24:23.702
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run. Injured pedestrian

24:23.712 --> 24:24.810
signed a complaint.

24:24.820 --> 24:29.002
Oh, well, I think I might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

24:29.012 --> 24:31.904
- I've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

24:31.914 --> 24:32.177
Well,

24:32.187 --> 24:35.438
I've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

24:35.448 --> 24:39.103
They don't seem to think
it's so ridiculous.

24:39.736 --> 24:41.970
Look,j u--
How can we fix--

24:42.037 --> 24:44.244
Were you in Massena, New York,
last Friday, second of May?

24:44.254 --> 24:47.861
Well, yeah, I live there,
but I didn't have any accident.

24:47.871 --> 24:51.859
Look, I'm just driving
down to Block Island to see my sister.

24:51.869 --> 24:55.186
You seem like a nice guy.
Is there anyway you might

24:55.196 --> 24:56.982
let me handle this by mail?

24:56.992 --> 25:00.464
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
I'm not the one you have to convince.

25:00.474 --> 25:03.602
If there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

25:03.612 --> 25:06.202
What? Okay, wait.
You--

25:06.269 --> 25:09.013
Because of somebody else's mistake,
I have to get in my car...

25:09.023 --> 25:12.933
and drive all the way back
to upstate New York?

25:19.939 --> 25:21.939
No, ma'am.

25:24.197 --> 25:27.682
We'll have one
of our troopers escort you.

25:29.923 --> 25:32.532
- [Phone Ringing]
- Hey, Hollywood, turn

25:32.542 --> 25:34.078
your fucking phone off.

25:34.088 --> 25:36.121
- Yeah?
- [Irene] You're an asshole.

25:36.131 --> 25:38.049
Oh, hello, Irene.
What did I do now?

25:38.059 --> 25:40.897
Listen, I'm sitting at a police station
somewhere in Rhode Island,

25:40.907 --> 25:43.775
and they're shipping me back
to Massena on some bogus crap.

25:43.785 --> 25:45.694
- Sound familiar?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

25:45.704 --> 25:47.811
- I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

25:47.821 --> 25:48.130
Dickie!

25:48.140 --> 25:50.471
Cut the bullshit!
[Sighing]

25:53.607 --> 25:57.982
Listen to me, okay?
It's over, Dickie. It's over.

25:58.059 --> 26:00.802
So please just stop
messing with me,

26:00.812 --> 26:03.623
and call your friends and
tell them to back off, okay?

26:03.633 --> 26:05.540
Look, I'm being
a straight shooter here.

26:05.550 --> 26:07.651
If you need help,
I'll help you.

26:07.661 --> 26:12.677
Just give me all the details. I'll
get to the bottom of it. All right?

26:12.687 --> 26:16.007
Massena, New York? Man, goddamn,
Daddy, that's damn near Canada.

26:16.017 --> 26:18.822
I know, I know.
It wasn't my idea.

26:18.836 --> 26:21.981
I gotta take this gal up north,
and then the colonel ordered me

26:21.991 --> 26:23.306
to take a week's vacation.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.445
Why a week?
Man, that's a long motherfuckin' time.

26:25.455 --> 26:28.813
Well, he wants me to rest while
I'm getting used to the medication.

26:28.823 --> 26:33.129
Aw, come on, you don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

26:33.139 --> 26:35.624
These two motherfuckers can do
the shoppin', and I'll do the cookin'.

26:35.634 --> 26:38.525
Man, you do the cookin'?
You thought you got chipped beef

26:38.535 --> 26:39.719
from a toothy blow job.

26:39.729 --> 26:44.266
You're gonna have Shonte Junior down
under goddamn 400 pounds. Fuck that.

26:44.276 --> 26:47.374
- Can't have that happen. Okay, guys.
- No, we can't, we can't.

26:47.384 --> 26:50.900
I'm not leaving till morning.
You know the rules when I go:

26:50.910 --> 26:52.362
No bitches after 11:00.

26:52.372 --> 26:54.033
[All Laughing]

26:54.043 --> 26:55.949
- All right, Pops!
- Yeah, man.

26:55.959 --> 26:58.240
- Bye, Daddy!
- Got ya, Papa!

26:58.250 --> 27:00.250
Love you, Daddy!

27:01.130 --> 27:04.612
Now who the hell's
this Irene honey, anyway?

27:04.622 --> 27:06.693
She worked for me
the past couple years.

27:06.703 --> 27:09.380
I hired her to be
my golf course superintendent.

27:09.390 --> 27:13.485
- We got close.
- No, you got stupid.

27:13.552 --> 27:17.080
For the love of shit,
these are the loose ends that can

27:17.090 --> 27:18.981
hang you, Dickie. And me too.

27:18.991 --> 27:22.395
- How much does she know?
- She might have gotten wind

27:22.405 --> 27:23.366
of some things.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.993
Yeah, well,
we're gonna find out.

27:26.003 --> 27:28.613
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

27:28.623 --> 27:30.637
He's with the E.P.A.

27:30.704 --> 27:33.668
E.P.A.?
I thought they were in our pocket.

27:33.678 --> 27:36.201
Well, not all of 'em.

27:50.331 --> 27:52.371
- Hang on, ma'am.
- Yeah.

28:00.604 --> 28:03.856
This vacation is
just what Charlie needs.

28:03.866 --> 28:07.127
I bet he's a new man
when he gets back.

28:07.194 --> 28:09.333
If we let him back.

28:10.494 --> 28:12.978
What do you mean?

28:13.055 --> 28:17.141
Well, I mean that he's become
a pretty big liability.

28:17.151 --> 28:19.387
We may have to let him go.

28:19.454 --> 28:23.318
Let him go? But-But, Captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li--

28:23.328 --> 28:27.156
I know, I know, damn it.
I know.

28:27.233 --> 28:30.846
I found you sittin'
on a suit case cryin'

28:30.856 --> 28:33.267
I found you sittin'
on a suit case cryin'

28:33.277 --> 28:35.348
It's a great time of year
to ride,

28:35.358 --> 28:38.588
long as you don't mind
one or two bugs.

28:41.861 --> 28:44.442
I laugh out loud
'cause it's the one thing

28:44.452 --> 28:48.375
I hadn't been trying

28:49.891 --> 28:52.921
The train came in breathless
The passengers restless

28:52.931 --> 28:56.231
She said
Baby you'll never change

28:56.289 --> 29:00.672
You gotta get gone
You gotta get goin'

29:00.739 --> 29:05.700
The world ain't slowin' down
for no one

29:05.767 --> 29:10.026
It's a carnival
callin' out to you

29:11.876 --> 29:15.483
It sounds like a song
It hits you like scripture

29:15.493 --> 29:18.298
Boy, you can't beat
the open road!

29:18.313 --> 29:20.519
[Insect Buzzing]

29:20.587 --> 29:25.603
Weren't you the kid who just
climbed on the merry-go-round

29:25.670 --> 29:29.738
Hey look the world
ain't slowin' down

29:31.561 --> 29:34.466
-Hey, hey
- Oh, no!

29:34.543 --> 29:38.735
Oh, my goodness.
Geez.

29:38.793 --> 29:41.766
[Sighs]
Those damn truckers.

29:41.833 --> 29:46.180
You know, you'd think they'd
call someone to come clean this up.

29:46.190 --> 29:48.941
Poor thing.
Oh, that's terrible.

29:49.009 --> 29:51.878
- Whew. Whoa.
- Ew.

29:51.954 --> 29:55.148
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

29:55.158 --> 29:58.630
Well, I doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.617
You wanna get that end?
Just give it a little push?

30:00.627 --> 30:04.070
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, we should give it a shot.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.804
- Okay? Go ahead.
- Okay.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.835
-Just-Just push as hard as you can.
- Yeah, okay.

30:09.845 --> 30:11.845
- [Grunting]
- [Mooing]

30:11.898 --> 30:13.810
-Jesus! Whoa!
- Oh!

30:13.820 --> 30:16.108
- Okay, you just--
- Oh, it's still alive.

30:16.118 --> 30:20.233
-Just stand back. I'll take care of it.
- God, that's terrible.

30:20.243 --> 30:24.310
- Oh. Now, don't-don't look, okay?
- Yeah.

30:24.377 --> 30:26.377
[Sighs]

30:29.115 --> 30:33.366
Well, old girl, [Sighs]
your suffering's over.

30:38.526 --> 30:41.337
[Bird Squawking]

30:41.404 --> 30:45.749
[Narrator]Oh, it ain't always easy
doing Mother Nature's work.

30:45.759 --> 30:47.762
- [Mooing]
- [Screams]

30:47.772 --> 30:48.406
Oh,J--

30:48.416 --> 30:50.416
[Grunts]

30:53.980 --> 30:55.980
[Sighs]

30:56.004 --> 30:58.786
Oh.
Do you believe that?

30:58.844 --> 31:01.567
- No, it's-- Yech.
- [Mooing]

31:01.634 --> 31:04.090
- Oh, my God in heaven!
- [Irene Groaning]

31:04.100 --> 31:06.585
- Oh, God!
- [Groaning]

31:06.661 --> 31:09.721
God! What the hell
is wrong with you?

31:09.761 --> 31:11.761
Die!

31:12.800 --> 31:14.586
Let go!
Let go, girl!

31:14.596 --> 31:17.337
- On to greener pastures. Come on.
- [Mooing]

31:17.347 --> 31:20.022
They're clear-cutting a place
in heaven for you. [Grunting]

31:20.032 --> 31:23.391
- Come on! Help me out! Do something!
- But--

31:23.401 --> 31:26.206
- I don't-- [Stammering]
- Let go!

31:28.197 --> 31:30.624
Let it go!
Go!

31:30.691 --> 31:34.651
- [Gurgling]
- [Gasps, Sighs]

31:34.728 --> 31:36.642
[Pants, Sighs]
Oh!

31:36.652 --> 31:38.652
[Panting]

31:40.523 --> 31:45.376
Well, that was tough,

31:45.453 --> 31:48.580
but I think we did
the right thing.

31:58.634 --> 32:02.049
Patrol car, yes.
Okay, thank you.

32:03.698 --> 32:05.737
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm Officer Bailey gates,

32:05.747 --> 32:06.825
Rhode Island State Police.

32:06.835 --> 32:10.691
I have, uh, your prisoner,
Miss Irene Waters here.

32:10.701 --> 32:14.346
- All right. I'll tell them you're here.
- Okay-dee, right-dee.

32:14.356 --> 32:16.356
[Phone Ringing]

32:20.342 --> 32:22.644
[Charlie Whistling]

32:24.687 --> 32:27.660
- What are those for?
- Huh?

32:27.727 --> 32:30.990
Oh, it's just
this stupid thing.

32:31.057 --> 32:36.016
I have to take a pill every six hours
or I feel funny. No big deal.

32:36.026 --> 32:39.056
- What's it called?
- [Exhales]

32:39.124 --> 32:44.989
Advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

32:45.245 --> 32:47.245
Ah.

32:48.189 --> 32:51.000
Does your ass feel numb?

32:52.669 --> 32:57.685
No, but they give me
unbelievable cotton mouth.

32:57.752 --> 33:01.139
- I meant from the ride.
- Oh, no, no.

33:01.215 --> 33:04.870
Over the years,
my ass has taken a pounding.

33:05.311 --> 33:06.260
Miss Waters,
my name is Peterson.

33:06.270 --> 33:07.671
Miss Waters,
my name is Peterson.

33:07.681 --> 33:10.098
This is my partner,
Agent Boshane.

33:10.108 --> 33:13.330
We're with the Environmental Protection
Agency's Special Investigations.

33:13.340 --> 33:15.253
- The E.P.A.?
- Yeah.

33:15.263 --> 33:17.177
What'd I hit?
A bald headed eagle?

33:17.187 --> 33:19.728
Well, we'll explain that
to you, ma'am,

33:19.738 --> 33:24.498
but right now, we're gonna ask you
to come along with us.

33:24.515 --> 33:27.843
- Well, why don't you
just explain it to me now?

33:27.853 --> 33:28.698
Well, ma'am,

33:28.708 --> 33:33.274
we put your hit-and-run report out
on the wire in order to track you down.

33:33.284 --> 33:37.543
- Track me down for what?
- Agent Boshane?

33:40.420 --> 33:44.574
I want to remind you again,
our station's at your disposal.

33:44.584 --> 33:46.877
You're more than welcome to use
any of our interrogation rooms.

33:46.887 --> 33:51.389
We appreciate it, Lieutenant Gerke,
but we're all set.

33:51.399 --> 33:55.475
All right. Well,
if there's anything at all I c--

34:05.736 --> 34:08.833
[Garbled]
Uh, excuse me.

34:08.909 --> 34:13.159
I'm just gonna
get myself a drink of water.

34:15.625 --> 34:18.013
[Slurping]

34:20.786 --> 34:24.096
Ahh! So if I could, uh,
[Clears Throat]

34:24.172 --> 34:26.464
just get someone to sign this,
I'll be on my way.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.842
Yeah.

34:29.938 --> 34:31.911
Well, Miss Waters,
uh, good luck.

34:31.922 --> 34:33.763
And I hope everything
works out great for you.

34:33.773 --> 34:36.268
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

34:37.717 --> 34:40.402
I haven't done anything wrong,
and you know it.

34:40.413 --> 34:44.513
What about the marijuana roaches
you left behind when you moved

34:44.523 --> 34:45.976
out of your apartment?

34:45.985 --> 34:49.641
So I smoked some pot.
What is that, a crime?

34:50.523 --> 34:52.440
Uh-huh.

34:52.451 --> 34:55.059
As is being an accessory
to bribery, embezzlement,

34:55.069 --> 34:56.978
tax evasion
and racketeering.

34:56.987 --> 35:01.263
- What are you talking about?
- Does the name Dickie Thurman

35:01.273 --> 35:02.140
ring a bell?

35:02.150 --> 35:04.606
His company,
Cedar Creek Limited,

35:04.616 --> 35:07.349
has been under a sealed
grand jury investigation for 18 months.

35:07.359 --> 35:11.225
How does that make me an accessory?
I laid some sod on Dickie's golf course.

35:11.235 --> 35:11.387
So?

35:11.397 --> 35:15.741
Tell me this--a big operation like
the Cedar Creek Country Club--

35:15.751 --> 35:18.362
how'd you get the job
as the head greens keeper?

35:18.372 --> 35:22.879
By default. This guy,
Tedeschi or Tedescho,

35:22.947 --> 35:24.862
he was hired before me,
but he died.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.167
Heart problem or something.

35:28.904 --> 35:30.754
[Narrator]
The feds believed that Irene knew...

35:30.764 --> 35:32.673
more than
she thought she knew,

35:32.683 --> 35:34.715
and her life was in danger.

35:34.725 --> 35:38.466
They explained that everything had
been happening right under her nose--

35:38.476 --> 35:42.275
payoffs of government agencies, threats
towards those who stood in the way,

35:42.285 --> 35:44.932
and her predecessor's
heart attack?

35:44.942 --> 35:48.126
Well, that was just
cold blooded murder.

35:48.136 --> 35:50.477
Oh, man.

35:58.410 --> 36:00.932
Can you excuse me?

36:17.680 --> 36:20.713
Pizza kid.

36:22.708 --> 36:26.122
- How much?
- Uh, that comes to 13.95.

36:26.199 --> 36:28.199
[Grunts]

36:40.693 --> 36:42.693
[Grunts]

36:50.008 --> 36:52.347
Oh, son of a bitch!

37:00.158 --> 37:02.158
[Car Departing]

37:03.293 --> 37:05.293
[Panting]

37:08.511 --> 37:10.966
[Narrator] Well, it was a good thing
Charlie had told her...

37:10.976 --> 37:15.601
he was staying at the Chuck E. Cheese
Lodge and Miniature Golf Resort.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.202
Charlie?

37:17.212 --> 37:21.586
Irene finagled a key
from the front desk and let her self in.

37:21.596 --> 37:23.596
Charlie.

37:25.308 --> 37:27.308
[Snoring]

37:33.127 --> 37:37.146
- Charlie, what's going on here?
- Hmm? Irene?

37:37.223 --> 37:39.745
Oh! Oh, uh, uh--
[Chuckling]

37:39.812 --> 37:43.994
Irene, I was just, um--
I was gonna, um, study your file...

37:44.004 --> 37:46.824
and, uh, try to find
a loophole.

37:48.905 --> 37:52.129
Did your lips get as chapped
as mine on the ride down?

37:52.139 --> 37:54.075
Nevermind!
I need your help.

37:54.085 --> 37:56.828
There was a shootout down at the thing,
and the agents are dead.

37:56.838 --> 38:00.129
- Dead?
- Yeah, they were after me, Charlie.

38:00.139 --> 38:00.474
Oh, God. See, this is Dickie's work.
I know it.

38:00.484 --> 38:04.394
Oh, God. See, this is Dickie's work.
I know it.

38:07.085 --> 38:11.266
- So what are you gonna do?
- We'll call the police.

38:11.276 --> 38:13.185
What?
No, you can't do that.

38:13.195 --> 38:16.388
Dickie has those guys in his
back pocket. That's why I came to you.

38:16.398 --> 38:18.402
- How-- Wha-- How do you--
- Oh!

38:18.412 --> 38:21.607
Hey, this is serious shit!
You don't--

38:21.674 --> 38:24.130
[Sighs]
I'm outta here.

38:24.207 --> 38:26.572
Hey, wait. No, don't do that!
Come on, hold on!

38:26.582 --> 38:28.485
Just let me think for a second, okay?

38:28.495 --> 38:31.976
Think someplace else, Charlie. This is
the first place they're gonna look.

38:31.986 --> 38:33.986
Damn it!

38:41.137 --> 38:44.962
- So where are we going, anyway?
- You'll see!

38:46.001 --> 38:48.686
[Narrator]
Well, they went on the lam for a bit,

38:48.696 --> 38:51.717
- and then Charlie made
a couple of phone calls.

38:51.727 --> 38:53.727
[Barking]

39:00.755 --> 39:03.411
Irene, take it easy now.

39:03.479 --> 39:06.413
- Charlie?
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

39:06.423 --> 39:09.972
- Hey.
- Good work, Bailey gates.

39:10.039 --> 39:11.968
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry I had to meet you

39:11.978 --> 39:13.043
all the way out here.

39:13.053 --> 39:14.959
No, that's okay.
It's just as well.

39:14.969 --> 39:17.454
Poor gal's a little paranoid.
My kids are like that.

39:17.464 --> 39:19.487
Somewhere along the line,
they just get this idea that

39:19.497 --> 39:20.524
the cops are the bad guys--

39:20.534 --> 39:24.659
[Grunting, Gasping]

39:27.106 --> 39:30.960
Listen, I don't know what's going on,
and I didn't tell the feds anything.

39:30.970 --> 39:34.587
Dickie told me
you were street smart, huh?

39:34.654 --> 39:36.563
Why the hell would you
run back to this idiot?

39:36.573 --> 39:38.913
[Drums]

39:42.146 --> 39:45.886
Drop the gun, moron.
You're being videotaped.

39:48.133 --> 39:52.890
- What are you talkin' about?
- There's a camera on my bike.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.730
- [Irene Screams]
- Hard to hit a moving target,

39:56.740 --> 39:58.740
isn't it?

39:59.874 --> 40:02.914
- [Grunting]
- [Groaning]

40:10.819 --> 40:12.958
[Panting]

40:13.034 --> 40:15.232
Score. Good move.

40:15.309 --> 40:18.119
Get in the car.

40:18.186 --> 40:22.606
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

40:23.595 --> 40:27.230
[Irene] Would you mind telling me what
the hell you were thinking back there?

40:27.240 --> 40:29.955
Calling that cop
was unbelievably stupid.

40:29.965 --> 40:33.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.297
Tweak the high end
of your emotional E.Q, sweetbeak.

40:35.307 --> 40:37.341
The funky chicken
was Charlie's dance.

40:37.351 --> 40:40.997
I'm a tango man myself.

40:41.074 --> 40:44.009

40:44.076 --> 40:45.988
[Snarls]

40:45.998 --> 40:50.053
[Narrator]As you can imagine,
there was some explaining to do.

40:50.063 --> 40:53.419
So, Hank, [Clears Throat]
as he called himself,

40:53.429 --> 40:57.515
found a quiet spot
and spelled out the whole darn mess.

40:57.525 --> 41:00.938
Okay, so what you're saying is
that you're not Charlie.

41:00.948 --> 41:03.693
Come on, you've seen Charlie in action.
The guy's like origami.

41:03.703 --> 41:07.051
He folds under pressure.
When the big game's on the line,

41:07.061 --> 41:08.614
he's busy ridin' the pine.

41:08.624 --> 41:11.259
Okay, wait, wait.
Can you just--

41:15.923 --> 41:18.638
It's simple.

41:18.705 --> 41:20.939
Charlie's the mouse
that got you into the maze.

41:20.949 --> 41:23.760
I'm the rat who knows
how to find the cheese.

41:23.770 --> 41:27.214
The name's Hank--
Hank Evans.

41:27.291 --> 41:30.801
- For little girls
- So it's true.

41:30.869 --> 41:34.321
- Charlie is a schizo.
- I wouldn't know.

41:34.389 --> 41:37.900
I stay outta his business,
he stays outta mine.

41:37.910 --> 41:39.910
Look.

41:42.619 --> 41:44.756
Just because I rock
doesn't mean I'm made of stone.

41:44.766 --> 41:47.099
I feel your fear.

41:47.165 --> 41:51.330
It's comin' through like static
on my heart radio.

41:52.673 --> 41:55.003
Hank? Hank.

41:56.030 --> 41:59.060
I really, really
appreciate your help,

41:59.070 --> 42:01.938
but is there anyway
that maybe we could get...

42:01.948 --> 42:05.334
Charlie back out here
for a little huddle?

42:05.344 --> 42:07.344
No problem.

42:07.397 --> 42:09.207
While you're at it,
climb that pole over there and

42:09.217 --> 42:10.361
take a piss on the power lines.

42:10.371 --> 42:14.360
Look, I'm not here to twist your
niblets. I'm here to save your life.

42:14.370 --> 42:19.425
But if I'm gonna do that,
I'll need total "uninanonynymity."

42:22.946 --> 42:24.859
Okay.

42:24.869 --> 42:29.787
- Sound good, candypants?
- Hank, don't call me that.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.097
Man, how the hell
can they call Pluto a planet?

42:44.107 --> 42:46.178
What motherfuckin' planet
has an elliptical orbit?

42:46.188 --> 42:48.098
Man, this shit
don't make no sense.

42:48.108 --> 42:53.028
Motherfucker! That motherfucker Vince
Foster was murdered! I told you!

42:53.038 --> 42:56.645
Will you quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files?

42:56.655 --> 42:59.682
Ain't no nevermind who them
crooked politicians be killin'.

42:59.692 --> 43:00.835
Just do your studyin'.

43:00.845 --> 43:03.159
- Man, what did Daddy tell you
about snoopin', huh?

43:03.169 --> 43:03.907
Shit, yeah, man.

43:03.917 --> 43:06.034
You keep fuckin' around,
you gonna get that scholarship

43:06.044 --> 43:07.139
to Yale taken away from you.

43:07.149 --> 43:10.342
Be stuck up there at Stanford with them
goddamn sling-blade motherfuckers.

43:10.352 --> 43:12.265

43:12.275 --> 43:14.773
Shit, motherfucker,

43:14.783 --> 43:16.098
gettin' a 1430 on your S.A.T.

43:16.108 --> 43:18.534
- Motherfucker, you know I had the flu.
- The flu, my ass.

43:18.544 --> 43:21.479
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
gettin' a 1430.

43:21.489 --> 43:23.623
- Aneurysm?
Man, you talkin' some shit now.

43:23.633 --> 43:24.138
[Knocking]

43:24.148 --> 43:27.495
Now you see, man? That's probably
one of them Ivy League sum bitches now.

43:27.505 --> 43:29.001
- Get your big-ass head up
and get the door, man.

43:29.011 --> 43:29.412
Get the door.

43:29.422 --> 43:30.660
- Don't fuck with my shit.
- Get outta the way.

43:30.670 --> 43:31.342
Gimme some of them chips.

Hey, Captain.

43:33.913 --> 43:37.422

- What the fuck is goin' on, man?

43:37.432 --> 43:40.847
- This is Agent Anicelli.
- Gentlemen.

43:40.914 --> 43:43.791
- What's happenin', Captain?
- We've got a problem.

43:43.801 --> 43:46.104
Pack your bags.

43:51.707 --> 43:53.614
- We're locked and loaded.
- Great.

43:53.624 --> 43:57.455
- Got enough stuff
to hold us over for 72 hours.

44:42.566 --> 44:47.035
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

44:47.103 --> 44:50.297
You gonna pick up that butt, or do I
have to glue it to the end of my shoe...

44:50.307 --> 44:52.378
and stick it in your
big, fat, pimply A-hole?

44:52.388 --> 44:56.379
Hey, man, take it easy.
It's just a cigarette.

44:56.456 --> 45:00.416
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is just a fist.

45:00.484 --> 45:03.746
But when I start throwing it around,
it can leave one hell of a mess.

45:03.756 --> 45:05.761
Let's dance.

45:22.663 --> 45:25.933
Hey, hey!

45:26.002 --> 45:29.062
Let's kick the shit
outta this crazy asshole.

45:29.072 --> 45:32.199
Wait, wait. Wait!
He's a schizo!

45:32.265 --> 45:34.815
What the hell's wrong
with him?

45:37.042 --> 45:39.181
What happened, anyway?

45:39.248 --> 45:43.746
[Narrator] Yeah, Charlie was taking a
few lumps on account of Hank's behavior.

45:43.756 --> 45:49.791
But, save for a little blood in the
urine, he was no worse for the wear.

45:50.261 --> 45:52.265
I'm sorry you had to meet Hank,
Miss Waters.

45:52.275 --> 45:57.714
I thought I was bad.
That guy has some serious problems.

45:58.741 --> 46:00.741
He did save our lives.

46:02.903 --> 46:05.196
Anyway, Hank had
a pretty good idea.

46:05.206 --> 46:07.181
- He thinks that maybe--
- Oh, and you're gonna listen to Hank?

46:07.191 --> 46:10.184
Come on!Look what he did tome.
I mean, what are you thinkin'?

46:10.194 --> 46:12.744
He's out of control, this guy.

46:12.793 --> 46:15.307
You know what I think
we should do?

46:15.317 --> 46:17.067
I think we should find
another department

46:17.077 --> 46:18.384
and tell them the whole story.

46:18.394 --> 46:23.579
Not smart, Charlie. We don't know
how far Dickie's reach goes.

46:24.602 --> 46:26.674
Well, then, you know what?

46:26.684 --> 46:31.087
I think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country:

46:31.097 --> 46:33.265
the Rhode Island State Troopers!

46:33.275 --> 46:37.494
Do you really think the feds don't have
some guy up there now bugging calls?

46:37.504 --> 46:40.017
They'd be on us
in ten minutes.

46:40.027 --> 46:42.837
And they're the ones that almost
got me killed in the first place.

46:42.847 --> 46:47.154
Okay. What was
the genius's big plan?

46:47.231 --> 46:50.674
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

46:50.684 --> 46:53.139
Oh, yeah?
What about water? What about food?

46:53.149 --> 46:56.974
He already got supplies.
They're in the trunk.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.490
- These are the supplies?
- Mm-hmm.

47:10.848 --> 47:14.263
Well, he had a plan, all right.
[Sucking Sounds]

47:14.273 --> 47:17.093
That's it?
That's all he got?

47:17.160 --> 47:19.969
Oh, no, there's more.

47:20.036 --> 47:24.067
A rope, a shovel,

47:24.134 --> 47:26.954
bag of lime
and some lawn darts.

47:39.530 --> 47:41.362
- and the kidnapping
of one Irene P. Waters.

47:41.372 --> 47:42.052
That's bullshit!

47:42.062 --> 47:44.023
My daddy ain't killed nobody,
and he sure as shit ain't

47:44.033 --> 47:45.121
kidnapped no skinny-ass bitch!

47:45.131 --> 47:47.398
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had some sort of breakdown.

47:47.408 --> 47:48.421
That's what we understand.

47:48.431 --> 47:51.808
The important thing is we find him, so
nobody else gets hurt, himself included.

47:51.818 --> 47:53.736
Come on, man,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

47:53.746 --> 47:56.163
Hell, yeah. Our daddy wouldn't hurt
a motherfuckin' fly.

47:56.173 --> 47:58.465
No, he goes after bigger game.

47:58.475 --> 48:01.449
We just got a report he put six bullets
into a prize cow's head.

48:01.459 --> 48:04.009
Poor thing's lucky
to be alive.

48:06.063 --> 48:09.285
Okay, look, let's say he does
have a problem-- which he don't.

48:09.295 --> 48:11.305
- He's been taking pills
to get rid of it, anyway.

48:11.315 --> 48:12.585
He left his pills in the hotel.

48:12.595 --> 48:14.504
- Damn.
- That's where he left his sanity.

48:14.514 --> 48:17.736
I've seen it first hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

48:17.746 --> 48:22.503
L-L-Look. One thing
I don't understand, Lieutenant.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.361
If my daddy's
such a scary-ass motherfucker,

48:24.371 --> 48:25.612
why'd you go by yourself, huh?

48:25.622 --> 48:28.026
Yeah, who the fuck are you,
Sergeant York, tryin' to take on

48:28.036 --> 48:29.131
the Germans your damn self?

48:29.141 --> 48:32.296
Your father's a police officer,
and he asked me to come alone.

48:32.306 --> 48:34.063
How was I to know he's a nut case?

48:34.073 --> 48:35.788
- Man, our daddy ain't
no fuckin' nut case.

48:35.798 --> 48:36.364
He may have...

48:36.374 --> 48:39.723
advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage,

48:39.733 --> 48:42.283

Tell me what's a-happening.

Stay away from me, Hank!
I know what you had planned.

48:57.878 --> 49:00.271
I saw your so-called supplies.

49:00.281 --> 49:02.802
Oh, that?

49:04.443 --> 49:07.378
I wasn't gonna just
ram it home, you know.

49:07.388 --> 49:09.594
I was gonna lube it up...

49:09.661 --> 49:13.171
and ease it in there
inch by inch, like a gentleman.

49:13.181 --> 49:16.788

Thank you.

in a long time.

49:30.170 --> 49:30.869
What's so funny?

49:30.879 --> 49:34.399
- We're drivin' a hot carriage.
- So?

49:34.466 --> 49:36.759
That stuff belongs
to the bad cop.

our dead bodies down to the station?

[Narrator] Irene decided
they should go back to Rhode Island,

49:50.631 --> 49:53.316

- Are you kiddin'?

like it's a sin

For you to let me in

50:19.139 --> 50:22.880

tracking us in that car.

50:22.948 --> 50:25.115

- Sure.

Let me guess. Everybody in town
told you you were easy on the eyes,

51:39.410 --> 51:41.895
So you packed on a few pounds
and started calling yourself an actress.

51:41.905 --> 51:43.905
- Uh, no.
- Shh!

51:43.958 --> 51:46.192
Unfortunately,
you can't get far without talent,

51:46.202 --> 51:48.112
and after a while the only bright lights
you saw were the ones...

51:48.122 --> 51:50.508
that hit you in the face
when you opened the fridge.

51:50.518 --> 51:52.946
That's when you got a boob job, started
hanging around on the Upper East Side,

51:52.956 --> 51:54.537
looking for a rich, old man
with a bum ticker...

51:54.547 --> 51:59.055
and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

51:59.065 --> 52:01.521
How's my aim?

52:01.588 --> 52:04.878
I never went to New York City.
I went upstate to Cornell.

52:04.888 --> 52:07.602
And then I got my master's
in turf management at U-Mass.

52:07.612 --> 52:09.934
And then I became
a golf course superintendent.

52:09.944 --> 52:13.233
And these, believe it or not,
are all mine.

52:13.243 --> 52:16.208
I noticed you conveniently
left out your eating disorder.

52:16.218 --> 52:21.233
- I don't have an eating disorder.
- Whatever you say, slim.

52:23.709 --> 52:26.040
- Whoa!
- Hands off, Hank.

52:28.448 --> 52:30.448
[Calliope]

52:34.367 --> 52:37.436
- Hey! Mom!
- [Growling]

52:37.503 --> 52:41.588
That's real nice, Hank.
Way to keep a low profile.

52:41.598 --> 52:43.978
It's survival at this point.

52:45.187 --> 52:50.012
Hey, I know how to score
some dough. Punch me.

52:50.089 --> 52:52.572
- What?
- Punch me in the face.

52:52.582 --> 52:54.491
- Why?
- I'll flag the big cheese,

52:54.501 --> 52:56.409
tell him I got rolled
in the parking lot.

52:56.419 --> 52:58.328
He'll hush me up
with a couple of Benjamins.

52:58.338 --> 53:00.654
They don't need that kind
of ink on Sugar Mountain.

53:00.664 --> 53:01.821
Come on, rip my head off.

53:01.831 --> 53:04.383
That's really lame, Hank.

53:04.460 --> 53:06.396
Well, you have a better idea?
Come on.

53:06.406 --> 53:08.737
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is gonna work,

53:08.747 --> 53:09.859
but you gotta rock me.

53:09.869 --> 53:12.713
Don't give me one of those girly
"I don't wanna break a fingernail"

53:12.723 --> 53:13.149
love taps.

53:13.159 --> 53:15.230
This guy's gotta look
at my face and just--

53:15.240 --> 53:18.061
[Grunting, Yelling]

53:20.141 --> 53:24.161
[Narrator] Well, the kick in the chops
didn't work out as planned,

53:24.171 --> 53:27.423
and it just left Charlie
a little more roughed up.

53:27.433 --> 53:29.792
- How's the nose feelin'?
- Listen to it.

53:29.802 --> 53:32.363
[Nose Whistling]

53:32.430 --> 53:36.392
- I'm really sorry, Charlie.
- I'll get over it.

53:36.402 --> 53:40.997
I mean, you should be furious. I just
drop-kicked you right in the face.

53:41.007 --> 53:44.065
- Hey, it happens.
- [Nose Whistling Continues]

53:44.075 --> 53:46.237
- [Grunts]
- You got a great way

53:46.247 --> 53:48.201
of looking at life, Charlie.

53:48.211 --> 53:50.591
You know that?
That's a gift.

53:50.637 --> 53:53.093
Yeah, I don't know
if my shrinks would agree.

53:53.103 --> 53:55.020
- They think that's my problem.
- What?

53:55.030 --> 53:59.366
Oh, that I purposely distort
my perceptions...

53:59.443 --> 54:02.924
- to make my reality more palatable.
- [Nose Whistling]

54:02.934 --> 54:05.418
Oh, like you only hear
what you wanna hear?

54:05.428 --> 54:10.868
Thanks. I like to keep it short,
especially in the summer.

54:13.372 --> 54:20.002
How come I couldn't have ended up with
an easygoing guy like you, Charlie, huh?

54:29.823 --> 54:32.144
It's like you don't
give a damn, you know?

54:32.154 --> 54:35.444
And your skin's so natural. You just
let it hang out, blemishes and all.

54:35.454 --> 54:37.841
You're not afraid of your flaws.
You have squinty eyes,

54:37.851 --> 54:40.470
and your face is all pursed up
like you just sucked on a lemon,

54:40.480 --> 54:42.480
but you pull it off.

54:45.055 --> 54:47.223
[Train Whistle Blowing]

54:50.878 --> 54:53.429
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

54:53.507 --> 54:55.702
[Irene]
Oh, no.

54:55.779 --> 54:57.785
Oh, yeah.

54:57.852 --> 55:01.689
- [Cracking]
- [Groaning] Come on.

55:03.587 --> 55:06.264
- But I don't know if I can!
- Yes, you can!

55:06.274 --> 55:09.142
Humans only use ten percent
of their potential.

55:09.152 --> 55:12.087
You gotta reach down
for that little extra something.

55:12.097 --> 55:15.676
- [Panting, Nose Whistling]
- [Panting]

55:15.752 --> 55:18.727
There you go!
Now you're gettin' it!

55:18.793 --> 55:21.536
I believe in you!

55:22.889 --> 55:25.698
Don't you give up on me now!

55:30.629 --> 55:33.439
It's easier than I thought!
Come on!

55:33.449 --> 55:35.521
Go, Charlie, go!

55:35.588 --> 55:38.592
You can do it!
Come on, Charlie!

55:38.669 --> 55:41.796
Use more
of your potential!

55:41.863 --> 55:43.863
[Grunting]

55:47.724 --> 55:50.055
Come on, Charlie!
Go!

55:50.122 --> 55:54.053
- Come on, jump off! Jump off!
- What?

55:54.121 --> 55:56.137
What?

55:56.204 --> 55:59.177
Jump off the train!

55:59.245 --> 56:01.768
Oh.

56:01.835 --> 56:03.835
[Screams]

56:05.133 --> 56:05.450
- [Nose Whistling]
- Ow.

56:05.460 --> 56:07.532
- [Nose Whistling]
- Ow.

56:07.599 --> 56:09.513
Irene?

56:09.523 --> 56:13.162
- [Gasping]
- Come on, stop foolin' around.

56:13.230 --> 56:16.741
[Sighing, Panting]
I started thinking about it. Bad idea.

56:16.751 --> 56:19.868
Trains are the first place
they'll look.

56:19.878 --> 56:22.458
Oh, come on.

56:22.535 --> 56:25.241
Hey, we checked all the major gas and
food stops along the interstate.

56:25.251 --> 56:27.167
- No sign of him.
- [Scoffs] The interstate?

56:27.177 --> 56:29.307
Let me ask you something, man.
Is your old lady happy?

56:29.317 --> 56:32.166
My "old lady"?

56:32.233 --> 56:34.525
Yeah, man, because if your fucking
is anything like your police work,

56:34.535 --> 56:36.828
you couldn't hit the G-spot
on a 12-pound pussy.

56:36.838 --> 56:39.429
- [Laughing]
- Watch yourself.

56:40.618 --> 56:42.687
- What are you getting at?
- Look, man.

56:42.697 --> 56:44.607
A: Daddy ain't
gonna take no road...

56:44.617 --> 56:47.168
where y'all blind-ass,
Helly Kelly cops is looking.

56:47.178 --> 56:50.833
And B: Motherfucker,
he don't eat fast food.

56:52.301 --> 56:54.209
[Irene]Okay, I have three
dollars and a nickel.

56:54.219 --> 56:56.127
- How much do you have?
- Uh, six bucks.

56:56.137 --> 56:58.327
-Just let me go up and order
so we can get out of here.

56:58.337 --> 56:58.535
Okay.

56:58.545 --> 57:01.768
I'll have the chicken breast sandwich,
no skin, dry toast.

57:01.778 --> 57:05.519
[Slurping]

57:05.586 --> 57:08.810
You make me dizzy
running circles in my head

57:08.820 --> 57:10.853
One of these days

57:10.930 --> 57:14.795
I'll chase you down

57:16.685 --> 57:18.685
Look who's goin' crazy

57:18.738 --> 57:21.356
Now we're face to face
my friend

57:21.366 --> 57:26.094
Better get out
better get out

57:26.162 --> 57:28.167
What are you
staring at, fucker?

57:28.177 --> 57:30.565
[Continues, Indistinct]

57:30.642 --> 57:33.807
You want to start me up?Just open
the choke and pull the cord, pal.

57:33.817 --> 57:37.193
I'm due for a seismic event,
and you're dancing on the fault line.

57:37.203 --> 57:39.111
Hey, what is
your problem, pal?

57:39.121 --> 57:41.836
I got no beef with you.
This is between me and the kid.

57:41.846 --> 57:44.944
- Hey, stop it!
- He started it.

57:45.012 --> 57:47.083
I'm so sorry.
I have to apologize for him.

57:47.093 --> 57:49.587
- He suffers from this thing--
- I'm right here, four-eyes. Let's go.

57:49.597 --> 57:52.878
Oh, poor baby. He has to let his daddy
fight his battles for him.

57:52.888 --> 57:55.707
- [Clucking]
- He's an ass.

57:57.751 --> 58:01.051
[Continues Clucking]

58:02.815 --> 58:04.821
Pussy.

58:08.897 --> 58:10.806
How's it hangin', fellas?

58:10.816 --> 58:12.816
Hank, I presume?

58:14.749 --> 58:16.964
- Did you miss me?
- Why don't you just send

58:16.974 --> 58:18.106
Charlie back out here?

58:18.116 --> 58:21.462
-Things were finally becoming civilized.
-Listen, Pocahontas,

58:21.472 --> 58:24.082
unless you put your ear to the ground,
you'll never hear the buffalo coming.

58:24.092 --> 58:26.260
Look, I don't know
what that means, okay?

58:26.270 --> 58:28.503
It means either he's gotta
make up a battle plan,

58:28.513 --> 58:32.677
or old Hank's gonna have to
take over Fort Charlie for good.

58:32.687 --> 58:35.400
Did you just refer to yourself
in the fourth person?

58:35.410 --> 58:38.946
- Holy Jesus in heaven!
It's a giant Q-Tip.

58:38.956 --> 58:39.430
Hank.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.454
What?
I'm joking with the guy.

58:41.464 --> 58:45.455
Bringing a little sunshine
into his life. Careful, you'll peel.

58:45.465 --> 58:47.537
Do-Do you need
to see a menu?

58:47.547 --> 58:50.031
No, thank you.
We've ordered.

58:55.699 --> 58:58.319
- That's it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

58:58.395 --> 59:00.586
- Hold on there, cheese tits.
Did I miss something?

59:00.596 --> 59:01.645
Don't give me that shit!

59:01.655 --> 59:04.812
What you just did
to that kid was terrible.

59:04.822 --> 59:07.797
Didn't you see
the look on his face?

59:09.466 --> 59:12.186
Looked a little pale,
that's all.

59:12.284 --> 59:14.704
He was hurt and offended.

59:14.780 --> 59:17.973
Well, I disagree.
But why speculate?

59:18.040 --> 59:20.017
- Hey, milky, vamonos.
- Hey, no! No, no, no.

59:20.027 --> 59:21.658
- Hank, no.
- Come on, Brer Rabbit.

59:21.668 --> 59:22.865
Hop down the bunny trail.

59:22.875 --> 59:25.694
Come on.
Epa, epa, andale.

59:25.761 --> 59:27.676
Listen, uh,

59:27.686 --> 59:30.837
were you offended in any way
by our social interaction here?

59:30.847 --> 59:33.121
Y-Yeah.
Actually, I was.

59:35.173 --> 59:37.110
What was it,
the Q-Tip thing?

59:37.120 --> 59:42.204
Actually, I was pretty much offended
by everything that you said, sir.

59:42.214 --> 59:44.410
Oh.

59:46.818 --> 59:49.119
Sorry.

59:52.736 --> 59:55.585
I'm truly sorry.

01:00:01.092 --> 01:00:03.092
[Door Closes]

01:00:06.214 --> 01:00:10.560
[Folk]

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.750
You okay?

01:00:19.145 --> 01:00:22.080
You don't know what it's like,

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:25.831
spendin' all those years
trapped behind a wall of politeness--

01:00:25.841 --> 01:00:28.324
bound and gagged.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:33.237
A dark and silent world
where nothing grows but the anger.

01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:36.872
All because some doll-faced demon
he married...

01:00:36.882 --> 01:00:39.365
I aced up her boots and did
a Nancy Sinatra on him.

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.860
Charlie had a wife?

01:00:41.936 --> 01:00:45.449
[Scoffs]
And then some.

01:00:45.525 --> 01:00:48.871
I was a big piece
of the personality pie back then.

01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:51.884
But when she left him,
Charlie went numb...

01:00:51.894 --> 01:00:53.808
and I went AWOL.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:57.294
Well,

01:00:57.361 --> 01:01:00.872
if you were such a big part
of the personality,

01:01:00.882 --> 01:01:03.089
then she left you too.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.920
[Sobbing]
It's true.

01:01:12.978 --> 01:01:16.758
[Sniffling, Wheezing]

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:18.993
She left us.

01:01:20.988 --> 01:01:23.319
- I loved her.
- Oh.

01:01:23.386 --> 01:01:27.213
[Sniffling, Wheezing]
Why did she do this?

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:31.637
I'm not a bad person.

01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:34.743
I'm not a bad person.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.141
No, no.
You're not a bad guy.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.320
No, you're not.

01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:41.333
Do you hear me, huh?

01:01:41.343 --> 01:01:43.991
[Sniffling, Wheezing]

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:48.662
You're a good person.

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:53.238
You really think so?

01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:56.605
Yeah, I'm starting to.

01:02:05.345 --> 01:02:08.549
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Hmm?

01:02:08.616 --> 01:02:11.263
I'm gonna
make it up to Charlie.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:15.963
And I'm gonna make it up to that
sweet little circus geek in there.

01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:17.885
Um--

01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:21.345
Um, Hank? Hank.

01:02:21.413 --> 01:02:23.800
Agent Boshane.
Just got lucky.

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.362
They were spotted leaving a health food
restaurant 100 miles southeast of here.

01:02:26.372 --> 01:02:29.857
- Fifteen minutes, tops.
- Got it, got it.

01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:38.305
They got 150 cordoned off?

01:02:38.382 --> 01:02:40.382
Let's fly.

01:02:46.056 --> 01:02:50.285
I hear you are singing
a song of the past

01:02:51.312 --> 01:02:53.316
I see no tears

01:02:53.393 --> 01:02:56.453
- [Coughing]
-[Continues, Indistinct]

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:01.383
Can you please tell him
to stop this?

01:03:01.393 --> 01:03:03.393
Charlie, is that you?

01:03:07.764 --> 01:03:10.699
Hey, my nose.

01:03:10.766 --> 01:03:12.684
My nose is fixed.

01:03:12.694 --> 01:03:15.025
- [Chuckling]
- Well.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:17.005
Isn't that great?

01:03:17.015 --> 01:03:18.924
How did that happen?

01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:21.107
Well, um,

01:03:21.175 --> 01:03:23.082
Hank wanted to do
something nice foryou...

01:03:23.092 --> 01:03:25.576
so he insisted
that we, well,

01:03:25.654 --> 01:03:27.561
[Mumbling]
go to a plastic surgeon.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.480
What did you say?
Plastic sur--

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.408
- Did you say plastic surgeon?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:34.602
Oh, my God. Wh-What--
Ow! What is this?

01:03:34.612 --> 01:03:36.521
What is this?
What did-- Wh-- Was--

01:03:36.531 --> 01:03:38.449
Uh, what is this?

01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:42.507
Hank thought that you kind of
had a weak chin, so--

01:03:42.517 --> 01:03:45.749
What?

01:03:45.816 --> 01:03:48.244
I like my chin.
I-I-I have a--

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:50.167
I like my chin.

01:03:50.177 --> 01:03:55.093
It's my chin! It's my chin!
Mine! How did you pay for it?

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.654
- I loaned him the money.
- [Yells]

01:03:57.664 --> 01:04:00.407
Who the hell are you?

01:04:00.474 --> 01:04:03.294
It's me, Milky.

01:04:08.474 --> 01:04:11.121
Who the hell is Milky,
and what is he doing here?

01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:14.815
Uh, Irene has
a lot of people...

01:04:14.882 --> 01:04:17.270
who would like to see her
in an unmarked grave.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.736
And I don't think it's safe for you
to be hanging around with this.

01:04:19.746 --> 01:04:24.216
Why not? You, Irene and Hank
are my only friends.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:27.093
But what about your family?
Aren't they gonna miss you?

01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:29.213
My family's all--

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.321
[Sighs]
They're gone.

01:04:32.388 --> 01:04:34.388
Oh, geez.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.118
If we're taking you with us,
we can't be calling you "Milky."

01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:47.795
- What's your real name?
- Casper,

01:04:47.805 --> 01:04:50.393
but my friends call me "Whitey."

01:04:50.403 --> 01:04:52.648
Okay.

01:04:56.524 --> 01:05:01.127
I can't find
the time to tell you

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:10.278
I can't find
the time to tell you

01:05:10.346 --> 01:05:12.457
Whoa.

01:05:12.524 --> 01:05:15.075
So many things to say

01:05:15.152 --> 01:05:18.376
I could fit them in a book

01:05:18.444 --> 01:05:20.686
Of a thousand pages

01:05:22.155 --> 01:05:24.155
[Continues, Indistinct]

01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:31.938
Here you go, Mr. Murphy.
I got your car all filled up.

01:05:31.948 --> 01:05:34.635
Thank you, Joseph.

01:05:34.702 --> 01:05:38.931
- [Trickling]
- Oh, yeah. [Exhales]

01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:44.102
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch!

01:05:44.112 --> 01:05:46.606
What are you doing to my car?

01:05:46.673 --> 01:05:50.423
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna get you!

01:05:56.123 --> 01:05:59.091
I can't find
the time to tell you

01:05:59.101 --> 01:06:01.821
I can't find
the time to tell you

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.137
I look at your pretty face

01:06:06.204 --> 01:06:08.620
And I fall in love with you

01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:11.067
Every time I see you

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.134
[Continues, Indistinct]

01:06:29.821 --> 01:06:32.456
What's that on your shirt?
Whoa.

01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:36.367
I'm sorry.

01:06:37.408 --> 01:06:39.577
That was good.

01:06:39.644 --> 01:06:42.042
Charlie,
what the hell is that?

01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:44.727
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna fall for that.

01:06:44.737 --> 01:06:48.315
- No, Ch-Charlie.
- Uh-uh, not me.

01:06:48.382 --> 01:06:50.301
- No--
- Nice try, though.

01:06:50.311 --> 01:06:52.641
How dumb do I look?

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.886
[Grunting]

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:15.260
Hey, they only had
two rooms, 19 and 20.

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:17.990
So you guys will
have to bunk up.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.846
So, Whitey.

01:07:32.873 --> 01:07:34.791
What happened
to your family?

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.715
I killed them.

01:07:36.725 --> 01:07:39.683
Uh-Uh, come again?

01:07:39.759 --> 01:07:44.230
When I was 15, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping--

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.010
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

01:07:50.253 --> 01:07:53.707
She was awake, my sis,

01:07:53.774 --> 01:07:56.432
which I regret.

01:07:57.775 --> 01:08:00.595
Yeah, well.

01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:05.391
We all have family stuff.

01:08:05.459 --> 01:08:08.757
That's what makes
the holidays so hard.

01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:13.066
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

01:08:13.718 --> 01:08:16.011
To tell you the truth,
I really wasn't ready to leave,

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.319
but they said I had to.

01:08:21.143 --> 01:08:23.523
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.010
Well, I guess they need
the extra room...

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.361
for the real psychos.

01:08:30.428 --> 01:08:33.131
I'm gonna go next door and try
to make out with what's her face.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:35.118
- Go for it.
- All right.

01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:37.497
- What?
- Yeah.

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:40.174
He just told me that
he brutally murdered...

01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:42.639
his entire family
in their sleep.

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:45.337
- Oh, my God.
- He was a juvenile.

01:08:45.346 --> 01:08:47.346
They just let him out.

01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:52.020
So, I was gonna ask you...

01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:55.446
if I could stay here,

01:08:55.523 --> 01:08:58.746
but I can sleep in the car.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.760
That's me and my whipper snappers.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.359
- I'm Dorothy.
- [Laughing]

01:09:07.426 --> 01:09:10.140
Look at you.

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:13.662
When did you take this,
at Halloween?

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.448
No,just messing
around the house.

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:23.854
You seem like a really
good dad, Charlie.

01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:29.153
I try to be.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.837
They're incredible kids.
Oh, God.

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:35.139
So happy and funny.

01:09:35.206 --> 01:09:37.988
They never give me any grief.

01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:41.059
They're the top three students
in their class, out of 211.

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:43.484
- Golly.
- I don't know where they get it from.

01:09:43.495 --> 01:09:45.960
Well, that's just good genes.

01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:50.908
You know, I don't think I--

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:54.429
No, I don't think I Carry
even one picture anymore.

01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:56.617
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:09:56.684 --> 01:09:59.744
I used to, you know,
when I was younger.

01:09:59.754 --> 01:10:02.305
Pictures of friends
and stuff like that.

01:10:02.315 --> 01:10:05.768
I guess they just
got old and fell apart.

01:10:07.438 --> 01:10:10.344
Kind of like the friend ships.

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:13.439
That's too bad.

01:10:15.341 --> 01:10:18.958
[Chuckling]
Look at you.

01:10:19.025 --> 01:10:21.702
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you keep that one?

01:10:21.712 --> 01:10:23.917
- No, Charlie, that's yours.
- Are you kidding?

01:10:23.927 --> 01:10:25.836
- I have tons of them at home.
- No.

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.753
- No, I got a bunch. Come on.
- You do?

01:10:27.763 --> 01:10:29.678
Yeah.

01:10:29.688 --> 01:10:33.135
Okay. Thanks.

01:10:33.202 --> 01:10:36.656
You-- Thanks.

01:10:50.749 --> 01:10:52.749
I'm dry.

01:10:55.382 --> 01:10:58.355
You know,
I'm gonna go get a soda.

01:10:58.422 --> 01:11:00.340
- Do you want a soda?
- Sure. Okay.

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.458
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:11:09.061 --> 01:11:11.573
- [Banging]
- [Scoffs]

01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:22.494
[Laughing]

01:11:22.504 --> 01:11:25.750
I caught that, bozo.
Not once, but twice it burned you.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.380
[Laughing]

01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:35.766
Give it another kick. I don't think
you're gonna get it this time.

01:11:38.884 --> 01:11:42.337
- I think I just had an epiphany.
- What?

01:11:42.404 --> 01:11:45.694
That I might be able to control
this little problem of mine.

01:11:45.704 --> 01:11:47.939
Oh, how did you learn that?

01:11:47.949 --> 01:11:50.433
Well, first the Coke machine
robbed me, right?

01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:54.692
And I'm fine with that. But then,
some guy came up and laughed in my face.

01:11:54.702 --> 01:11:58.336
- Oh, no.
- No, no. But that's just it, see?

01:11:58.346 --> 01:12:01.379
Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

01:12:01.389 --> 01:12:04.524
I just took a deep breath,
counted backwards from ten

01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:05.857
and I said to the guy,

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:09.540
"Excuse me, sir, but your laughter is
not helping me right now."

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:12.418
And he said, "I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to make fun."

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.239
And that was it.
I helped him with his luggage.

01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:18.309
- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yes.

01:12:18.386 --> 01:12:20.582
- [Sighs]
- And you got the Cokes.

01:12:20.592 --> 01:12:25.637
Hey. Just a little rap on the side
of the machine and presto.

01:12:25.647 --> 01:12:28.367
Maybe that's it though,
you know?

01:12:29.072 --> 01:12:31.047
Look what I found in my bag.

01:12:31.057 --> 01:12:34.060
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

01:12:34.127 --> 01:12:36.305
What do you think?
Do you?

01:12:36.372 --> 01:12:38.185
Well, under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few. Okay.

01:12:38.195 --> 01:12:41.226
Well, under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few. Okay.

01:12:41.236 --> 01:12:43.566
- And these are the right circumstances.
- Okay.

01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:46.223
- All right.
- Here we go.

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.321
- Celebrate good times, come on
- Oh, well.

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.331
Oh, that must be mine.

01:13:07.259 --> 01:13:09.259
[Groaning]

01:13:21.178 --> 01:13:23.178
Ow.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.514
Oh, geez.

01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:45.439
Oh, God.

01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:47.449
Oh, my God!

01:14:02.378 --> 01:14:04.413
Irene.

01:14:04.489 --> 01:14:06.628
Hmm?

01:14:06.695 --> 01:14:07.481
Why am I peeing like I was
up all night having sex?

01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:10.781
Why am I peeing like I was
up all night having sex?

01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:13.438
[Narrator] Well, seems old Hank
had pulled a fast one.

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:15.683
And if that
wasn't bad enough,

01:14:15.693 --> 01:14:19.603
there was more trouble
right around the corner.

01:14:21.929 --> 01:14:24.671
I want everybody to stay put
and wait for my orders.

01:14:24.681 --> 01:14:27.011
You mean to tell me you couldn't tell
the difference between us?

01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:29.228
Are you serious?

01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:31.530
Who the hell could?

01:14:31.598 --> 01:14:33.737
A sober person, for one.

01:14:33.805 --> 01:14:36.557
So we had some drinks.

01:14:43.377 --> 01:14:46.097
Well, look who joined the party.

01:14:47.598 --> 01:14:49.517
Did you have fun?

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:52.040
Oh, yes I did!
Oh, yes I did!

01:14:52.116 --> 01:14:56.422
So I guess old Hanky-panky
wasn't enough for you, huh?

01:14:56.432 --> 01:14:59.531
It wasn't for me.

01:15:00.758 --> 01:15:02.758
[Sobbing]

01:15:02.802 --> 01:15:05.390
- Now, you're sure this is the woman?
- Absolutely.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.310
When my boyfriend Scooter
brought in the morning paper,

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.700
I recognized her right away.

01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:13.911
Thanks a lot.
Scooter.

01:15:20.922 --> 01:15:22.990
Hey, look, Starsky and Hutch.
Look, man, how about this, man?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.790
This is the plan, look.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.515
Why don't you let us talk to our dad so
this ain't gotta be no big thing, man?

01:15:26.525 --> 01:15:29.230
Thanks, fellas, but this is
the end of the line for you.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.570
Now, officer Stubie's gonna
drive you back to the chopper.

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.831
What? You brung us all the way
down here for us to leave now?

01:15:34.841 --> 01:15:36.980
Man, yeah. That don't make
no motherfuckin' sense.

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.157
Well, you guys have
done all you can do.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.334
This is strictly a police
matter from here on in.

01:15:41.344 --> 01:15:43.475
Wait.
It maybe a police matter to you,

01:15:43.485 --> 01:15:46.735
but the police don't matter shit
to me when it's my daddy in there.

01:15:46.745 --> 01:15:48.759
I said you're getting
the hell out of here.

01:15:48.769 --> 01:15:50.769
That's the end of it.

01:15:52.539 --> 01:15:54.458
Guys, look, I'm sorry.

01:15:54.468 --> 01:15:56.376
I hate to admit it,
but this time he's right.

01:15:56.386 --> 01:15:58.294
You can't be here.
It's a liability thing.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.026
- Hey, man,
he's the motherfuckin' liability.

01:16:00.036 --> 01:16:00.857
Don't worry about it.

01:16:00.867 --> 01:16:03.704
This is my investigation. I promise you
there will be no bloodshed.

01:16:03.714 --> 01:16:05.628
I promise.

You okay, Charlie?

01:16:14.496 --> 01:16:18.142
Uh, yeah. I'm just, uh,

01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:20.209
freshening up.

01:16:24.454 --> 01:16:26.834
How do you want
to handle it?

01:16:28.713 --> 01:16:31.227
I say we storm the place
and start shooting.

01:16:31.237 --> 01:16:33.154
But what if he's unarmed?

01:16:33.164 --> 01:16:35.714
Plant a gun on him afterwards.

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:42.691
Don't fuck it up this time.

01:17:03.765 --> 01:17:06.095
Agent Boshane.

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:09.633
It's Stubie.
He's got Baileygates and the girl.

01:17:09.643 --> 01:17:11.643
What?

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.836
This is Boshane.
What's going on?

01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:19.917
I caught them out on 134
in a stolen vehicle.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:21.837
Baileygates and the girl.
I got them.

01:17:21.847 --> 01:17:24.108
Officer Stubie, I don't want you
to attempt to move them alone,

01:17:24.118 --> 01:17:24.551
you hear me?

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.508
Don't move them.
We'll be right there.

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:28.518
In your car, come on.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:32.014
We sure is sorry
about this, Officer.

01:17:32.024 --> 01:17:34.248
But our daddy always told us
to trust our instinct,

01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:36.877
and our instinct is tellin' us
something don't smell right.

01:17:36.887 --> 01:17:39.371
- Come on, let's roll.
- You guys are making a big mistake.

01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:42.259
'Cause I promise you,
when I find your old man,

I'm personally gonna fuck him up.

01:17:48.024 --> 01:17:50.508
Now, why did you go and say
something like that for, huh?

01:17:50.518 --> 01:17:53.780
Lee Harvey, what's the diameter
of a chicken egg?

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:56.494
- 4.08 centimeters.
- No, no. What's that in inches?

01:17:56.504 --> 01:17:58.575
1.61, man. What the fuck
you gettin' at, man?

01:17:58.585 --> 01:18:00.334
I got ten bucks say
I can squeeze a chicken egg

01:18:00.344 --> 01:18:01.521
up his ass without it breakin'.

01:18:01.531 --> 01:18:04.984
Man, you can't put no chicken egg up his
ass. Look at him. He's a tight-ass.

01:18:04.994 --> 01:18:07.765
- No, it can be done. Right on.
- Yo, I'll take that bet.

01:18:07.775 --> 01:18:09.328

have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:23.440
What are we gonna do
about Whitey?

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.838
Take a guess.
We're going on without him.

Yeah, well, I didn't have
the fun you had last night.

I just got the hangover
and the swollen prostate.

01:18:32.735 --> 01:18:34.644
Do you have any cash left
from when we checked in?

01:18:34.654 --> 01:18:38.164
- Yes, 60 bucks, but it's Whitey's.
- Yeah, well.

- Yeah, whatever.

- Hey, give me the police scanner, man,

you talking about?

- Huh?
- I moved to New York.

01:40:14.743 --> 01:40:16.661
- Yeah?
-Just another well-rounded individual.

01:40:16.671 --> 01:40:20.403
That's great, Charlie.
I'm really happy for you.

01:40:20.413 --> 01:40:22.325
Thank you.

01:40:22.335 --> 01:40:24.373
Well, uh,

01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:28.632
I hope if you're ever,
you know, around here,

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:33.276
you'll, uh,
come and visit us.

01:40:33.343 --> 01:40:37.170
Yeah. Little Rhodie.

01:40:37.246 --> 01:40:40.136
Biggest little state in the union.

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:42.555
Yeah.

01:40:42.565 --> 01:40:45.496
Yeah.

01:40:47.904 --> 01:40:51.219
- Oh, let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

01:40:53.833 --> 01:40:56.450
- Hey, Irene.
- Yeah?

01:40:58.149 --> 01:41:01.719
Maybe I could come
visit you sometime soon.

01:41:01.987 --> 01:41:03.987
Promise?

01:41:05.354 --> 01:41:07.354
You bet.

01:41:10.475 --> 01:41:15.405
And that's the word
of a Rhode Island State Trooper, ma'am.

01:41:39.378 --> 01:41:44.260
I found you sitting
on a suitcase crying

01:41:45.844 --> 01:41:47.844
Beneath my feet

01:41:47.858 --> 01:41:52.078
I feel the rumble
of a subway train

01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:55.627
Yeah
I laugh out loud

01:41:55.694 --> 01:41:59.519
'Cause it's the one thing
I hadn't been trying

01:42:01.969 --> 01:42:05.286
The train came in breathless
the passengers restless

01:42:05.296 --> 01:42:08.433
You said
baby, you'll never change

01:42:08.501 --> 01:42:10.506
You gotta get gone

01:42:10.582 --> 01:42:13.517
You gotta get going

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:16.314
Hey, the world
ain't slowing down

01:42:16.376 --> 01:42:20.371
- You gotta be kidding.
-[Continues, Indistinct]

01:42:21.624 --> 01:42:23.624
Hold it right there.

01:42:28.924 --> 01:42:30.837
- Miss Waters.
- Yes?

01:42:30.847 --> 01:42:32.858
- I'd like you to step
out of the car please.

01:42:32.868 --> 01:42:33.874
What did I not do now?

01:42:33.884 --> 01:42:36.119
We have reason to believe
this is a stolen vehicle.

01:42:36.129 --> 01:42:38.040
What? No, no.

01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:40.185
I rented this car.

01:42:40.252 --> 01:42:43.397
Would you step
out of the car, please?

01:42:44.445 --> 01:42:46.445
Great.

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:50.037
- Front of the car, please.
- Mm-hmm.

01:42:50.047 --> 01:42:51.959
Hands on the hood.

01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:54.132
- Spread your legs.
- That's great. Uh-huh.

01:42:54.142 --> 01:42:55.616
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

01:42:55.626 --> 01:42:57.874
Just following procedure, ma'am.

01:42:57.884 --> 01:43:01.500
Oh, you guys.
You guys are beautiful.

01:43:01.567 --> 01:43:03.803
Look, why don't we
just skip the trial?

01:43:03.813 --> 01:43:08.282
Get right to it. You can lock me up
and keep me here forever.

01:43:08.292 --> 01:43:10.977
That's what I had planned.

01:43:24.359 --> 01:43:26.359
Oh, Charlie.

01:43:28.714 --> 01:43:30.714
[All Cheering]

01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:37.884
It sounds like a song
it hits you like scripture

01:43:37.894 --> 01:43:39.812
You paint the picture

01:43:39.822 --> 01:43:42.306
With colors squeezed
from your hand

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:44.228
Weren't you the kid

01:43:44.238 --> 01:43:46.691
Who just climbed
on the merry-go-round

01:43:46.701 --> 01:43:48.867
It's gonna be raining
wine and roses tonight.

01:43:48.877 --> 01:43:51.745
I'll tell you one thing. It's gonna be
raining my motherfuckin' cookies...

01:43:51.755 --> 01:43:53.990
if this motherfucker don't
stop this turbulence shit.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.908
-That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
-Come on, man.

01:43:55.918 --> 01:43:58.622
[Narrator] Well, that's
Charlie's story, and I'm sticking to it.

01:43:58.632 --> 01:44:02.949
They all moved in together
and lived as one big happy family--

01:44:02.959 --> 01:44:05.185
Charlie and Irene, the guys,

01:44:05.195 --> 01:44:08.331
even that nice
albino fella, Whitey.

01:44:08.398 --> 01:44:11.909
And I'm happy to report
Charlie got promoted to Lieutenant...

01:44:11.919 --> 01:44:14.950
in the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land,

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.779
the Rhode Island State Police.

01:44:17.837 --> 01:44:21.290
Yeah, it was
a regular slice of Americana.

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:26.740
Y'all come back now. Thanks
for watchin' our motherfuckin' movie.

01:44:28.024 --> 01:44:31.055
You gotta get gone
you gotta get going

01:44:31.065 --> 01:44:35.477
Hey, the world ain't
slowing down for no one

01:44:35.554 --> 01:44:38.470
-It's a carnival
calling out to you

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.219
[Mooing]

01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:43.161
It's calling out to you

01:44:43.228 --> 01:44:45.943
It sounds like a song
it hits you like scripture

01:44:45.953 --> 01:44:47.867
You paint the picture

01:44:47.877 --> 01:44:50.913
With colors squeezed
from your hand

01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:54.999
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go

01:44:55.009 --> 01:44:58.145
[Continues]

01:51:09.877 --> 01:51:13.425
Okay, everybody.
The water temperature is 63 degrees.

01:51:13.435 --> 01:51:16.783
Pop's thumb should be all right
if we find it within the next six hours.

01:51:16.793 --> 01:51:19.182
- You sure about that?
- Do the math, motherfucker.

01:51:19.192 --> 01:51:21.301
- Damn.
- Geez.

01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:33.111
- Hey, I think I found it.
- What?

01:51:38.721 --> 01:51:41.685
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey.
