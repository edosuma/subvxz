That magic show

00:05.653 --> 00:07.132
was awesome.

00:07.258 --> 00:08.655
I loved when the magician

00:08.656 --> 00:10.052
pulled money

00:07.258 --> 00:10.052
out of Jessie's nose.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.226
those boots I wanted.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.751
So far, I fail

00:20.752 --> 00:22.189
to see the magic

00:19.311 --> 00:22.189
in these magic rings.

Hey, Jessie!

00:42.334 --> 00:43.836
I was wondering

00:43.837 --> 00:45.337
if you want to

00:46.255 --> 00:47.256
have an apple?

is only 15 pigeons a month.

06:55.334 --> 06:57.626
for unlimited pigeons,

06:53.038 --> 06:57.626
but no.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.152

- you should post on the wall.

09:19.603 --> 09:20.811

09:20.936 --> 09:22.417
where you can spray yourself

09:22.418 --> 09:23.897

09:55.012 --> 09:56.972

11:02.079 --> 11:04.289

- You're gonna
- break a hip.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.132
No, Caitlyn, I am

18:31.133 --> 18:32.696
not seeing any other

18:29.567 --> 18:32.696
woman tonight.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.364
- Unless you count
- a 95-year-old

18:34.489 --> 18:35.907
- Who wants to be
- Willow Smith.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.640
And the princess discovered

18:39.641 --> 18:40.954
that Prince Smarming

18:41.079 --> 18:42.978
was a two-timing weenie

18:42.979 --> 18:44.875
with a grandma who whips

18:41.079 --> 18:44.875
her hair back and forth.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.044
The end.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.630
You okay, Jessie?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.383
I will be.

18:52.384 --> 18:54.009
Right after I go medieval

18:50.755 --> 18:54.009
on Prince Smarming's butt.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.784
Jessie's still not ready?

18:58.785 --> 19:00.098
(SCOFFS)

19:00.223 --> 19:01.325
- Any girl that
- makes me wait this long

19:01.349 --> 19:03.018
- Better look
- even cuter than I do.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.769
(CHUCKLES)

19:04.895 --> 19:07.502
You, sir, are a curry stain

19:07.503 --> 19:10.108
on the tablecloth of humanity.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.069
How can such a loser

19:12.070 --> 19:13.904
come in such a totes

19:10.233 --> 19:13.904
adorable package?

19:15.446 --> 19:16.969
You don't deserve

19:16.970 --> 19:18.491
a cool motorcycle.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.806
But I still want a ride.

19:19.807 --> 19:20.994
No, I don't!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.454
(MOUTHING)

19:23.580 --> 19:24.372
What's your problem?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.751
You. You are the problem!

19:27.876 --> 19:29.794
- You don't deserve
- a girl like Jessie.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.880
She's smart and pretty

19:31.881 --> 19:33.840
and nice and she always

19:29.920 --> 19:33.840
smells really, really good.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.109
- Like one of those
- fancy air fresheners

19:35.133 --> 19:37.010
- You plug in to
- an outlet of the wall.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.515
My point is...

19:42.640 --> 19:43.872
Jessie's great

19:43.873 --> 19:45.102
and you're a piece of

19:45.226 --> 19:47.437
moldy lasagna!

19:47.562 --> 19:49.522
No, doorman, the point is

19:49.523 --> 19:51.482
that Jessie thinks I'm great.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.986
And can you blame her?

19:55.112 --> 19:56.192
The doorman's name is Tony.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.575
- And even though
- he rides a dolly

20:00.700 --> 20:02.285
- And gives out
- linty apples,

20:02.410 --> 20:04.330
- He's more of a gentleman
- than you'll ever be.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.020
And I don't date guys

20:07.021 --> 20:08.458
who are afraid of dragons.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.959
That's a long story.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.335
Which you don't have

20:08.583 --> 20:11.335
time to hear,

20:11.461 --> 20:12.461
'cause you're leaving!

20:17.675 --> 20:19.570
- And I'm telling - your grandma that
- You're a two-timing loser.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.429
What? No, no, no, no!

20:21.554 --> 20:23.514
- Then she won't let me
- borrow the private jet.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.391
You have a private jet?

20:25.516 --> 20:27.560
Jessie, have mercy.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.107
Snap out of it!

20:35.568 --> 20:37.112
Bye-bye, Brody.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.428
(SCOFFS)

20:40.429 --> 20:41.616
Whatever. Your loss.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.120
(SCREAMS)

20:46.621 --> 20:48.039
Ta-da!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.043
- Thanks for sticking up
- for me, Tony.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.691
And by the way,

20:53.692 --> 20:55.213
you smell nice, too.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.506
Kind of lemony.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.195
Thanks.

20:58.196 --> 20:59.759
It's furniture polish.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.219
I wax my own desk.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.347
- Hello?
- Oh.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.103
So, Jessie, I was

21:09.104 --> 21:11.521
maybe wondering if you

21:11.646 --> 21:13.023
want to...

21:13.148 --> 21:14.274
I would love to go out

21:14.275 --> 21:15.399
on a date with you, Tony.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.985
- You would?
- Yeah.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.195
Huh, that was

21:18.196 --> 21:19.278
easier than I thought.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.509
Yeah, 'cause I did

21:20.510 --> 21:21.614
all the heavy lifting.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.451
Kids.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.207
My wife is so ugly,

21:31.208 --> 21:33.417
even the trolls go, "Ugh!"

21:34.878 --> 21:35.879
(GROWLS)

21:38.589 --> 21:40.529
I can't believe this guy won

21:40.530 --> 21:42.468
So You Think You Can Jest.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.116
Let's ask the Queen

21:44.117 --> 21:45.638
to cut off his head. Or ours.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.598
Your Highness.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.143
Sorcerer, is there

21:49.144 --> 21:50.560
anything you can do

21:50.685 --> 21:53.271
to make this jester funny?

21:53.396 --> 21:54.606
I am a sorcerer,

21:54.607 --> 21:55.815
not a miracle worker.

21:57.901 --> 21:58.901
Eh, but I will try.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.719
Before these

22:03.720 --> 22:05.033
awful jokes can fester,

22:05.158 --> 22:06.159
make this fool

22:06.160 --> 22:07.160
a better jester.

22:08.745 --> 22:09.829
(ALL GASP)

22:09.954 --> 22:11.414
- (EXCLAIMS)
- He disappeared!

22:11.539 --> 22:12.770
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)

22:12.771 --> 22:14.000
I didn't disappear.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.000
I'm down here.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.585
Hey, wait! Wait!

22:15.710 --> 22:16.857
Pretend you don't

22:16.858 --> 22:18.004
hear him.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.380
(WHISTLING)

22:19.505 --> 22:20.924
Hey, wait! Wait!

22:21.049 --> 22:22.739
A druid, a monk,

22:22.740 --> 22:24.427
and a varlet

22:21.049 --> 22:24.427
walk into a tavern...

22:24.552 --> 22:25.803
(GROWLING)

22:25.929 --> 22:28.181
(SCREAMING)

22:28.306 --> 22:29.891
- Hey, I can see
- my hovel from here.
