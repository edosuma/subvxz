WEBVTT

00:04.455 --> 00:06.081
I think it would be great
to go on a fast.

00:06.105 --> 00:08.257
- Yeah.
- A juice cleanse.

00:08.325 --> 00:09.958
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

00:10.027 --> 00:11.761
Zorn?

00:11.829 --> 00:14.250
All I asked was that
you get rid of your boxes.

00:14.251 --> 00:17.332
Yeah, yeah. No, I-I know. But
look, it's all my old awesome stuff.

00:17.401 --> 00:19.467
Man, I haven't seen
some of this crap in years.

00:19.536 --> 00:21.169
Oh, man. The Stone of Sight!

00:21.238 --> 00:22.905
You remember this, Edie?

00:22.973 --> 00:24.739
- Huh? You remember?
- I remember

00:24.808 --> 00:26.353
- the Stone of Sight, yes.
- So dangerous

00:26.377 --> 00:28.476
in the hands of evil.
Yeah, I really should have

00:28.545 --> 00:31.513
destroyed that a long time a...
Uh-oh! Game Boy! Ha-ha!

00:31.581 --> 00:33.835
Oh, my thumbs got quite a
workout on this bad boy.

00:33.837 --> 00:36.184
Zorn, this junk has been here for years.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.820
Craig needs some space
to wall-mount his bicycles.

00:38.889 --> 00:41.155
Bicycles? Who the hell rides bicycles?

00:41.224 --> 00:42.756
Uh, we do. Craig and I enjoy

00:42.825 --> 00:45.426
- riding bicycles together, as a couple.
- Oh, hey,

00:45.494 --> 00:47.237
Craig, you know what
Edie and I used to enjoy

00:47.238 --> 00:49.063
doing as a couple? Having tantric sex

00:49.132 --> 00:51.399
on top of a mountain
for months at a time. Yeah.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.845
You should try cycling, Zorn.
It's really good for your heart.

00:53.869 --> 00:55.114
Oh, you know what else
is good for your heart?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.537
Having tantric sex with Edie

00:56.605 --> 00:57.682
on top of a mountain
for months at a time.

00:57.706 --> 00:58.705
Nice shirt, by the way.

00:58.774 --> 01:00.241
It's a Nautica, Zorn.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.938
- Well, your mom's a Nautica.
- Okay.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.712
This is escalating.
My ears are getting hot.

01:03.781 --> 01:06.414
- I'm gonna go for an anger ride.
- Oh, let me guess...

01:06.483 --> 01:08.015
- On your bicycle?
- Zorn!

01:08.084 --> 01:09.127
If you don't clean this up,

01:09.151 --> 01:12.086
I am gonna have to throw it all out.

01:12.154 --> 01:14.689
Aw, come on, you really want
to get rid of our sex masks?

01:14.757 --> 01:18.562
Oh-ho-ho, man. We had a lot
of sex in these bad boys, huh?

01:18.684 --> 01:21.128
I've got to go to work.

01:21.197 --> 01:22.997
Hey, Edie. You still got that tattoo?

01:23.065 --> 01:25.800
The one with the Z on
one cheek, R-N on the other?

01:25.869 --> 01:27.969
I got rid of that tattoo
a long time ago.

01:28.037 --> 01:29.737
- Why?
- Because we got divorced, Zorn.

01:29.806 --> 01:31.016
- I don't need your...
- You know what?

01:31.040 --> 01:32.840
I'm sorry. I-I totally see

01:32.909 --> 01:35.610
where you're coming from, and
I will be moving the boxes now.

01:35.678 --> 01:39.002
Thank you. It's nice to
hear you sounding mature about

01:39.003 --> 01:40.725
the whole thing, because you see...

01:40.749 --> 01:43.250
Oh, this song is gonna be
stuck in my head for weeks.

01:45.604 --> 01:51.018

01:51.702 --> 01:54.355
Good boy, good boy.

01:54.904 --> 01:57.672
Nancy?

01:57.741 --> 02:00.375
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Alan.

02:00.444 --> 02:03.378
Alan, like, I live here
Alan, not stalking you or anything.

02:03.447 --> 02:05.112
Huh. Alan... Alan...

02:05.181 --> 02:06.715
Oh, right.

02:06.783 --> 02:09.583
Your dad, uh, he killed
that bird in your driveway.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.964
- Right? That Alan?
- Yeah. Oh, my God, I forgot about that.

02:11.988 --> 02:13.498
It's, like... Yeah, he just moved here

02:13.522 --> 02:15.089
from, like, this other country

02:15.158 --> 02:16.824
that's really brutal and crazy...

02:16.893 --> 02:18.459
I get it. My dad's from Cambodia.

02:18.527 --> 02:20.461
- He was in the Khmer Rouge...
- Oh.

02:20.529 --> 02:22.663
...and during the war, he, uh,

02:22.732 --> 02:25.266
did a lot of bad, bad things.

02:25.335 --> 02:27.801
- Oh. Um...
- Alan!

02:27.871 --> 02:29.337
I'm kidding.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.372
He owns a used car dealership.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.874
Okay!

02:32.942 --> 02:34.842
Wow, that's, like, a big difference.

02:34.911 --> 02:37.345
Why the hell is Alangulon
talking to that elfish,

02:37.413 --> 02:39.013
waifish Asian maiden?

02:39.082 --> 02:40.748
Oh, boy, that's a tongue twister.

02:40.816 --> 02:42.416
Elfish, waifish Asian maiden.

02:42.485 --> 02:44.017
Elfish, waifish... Mm!

02:44.086 --> 02:45.552
This one time this lady asked my dad

02:45.621 --> 02:48.355
if he was Vietnamese,
and he went ballistic.

02:48.424 --> 02:50.557
He was like, "No, I'm Cambodian!" And...

02:50.626 --> 02:53.193
he kicked a dent in
her car. So embarrassing.

02:53.262 --> 02:55.696
Oh, wait.

02:55.765 --> 02:58.399
- Are you in P.E. with Jules Davey?
- Yeah, I'm, uh...

02:58.467 --> 03:01.268
He was dating my friend
Alison for a second,

03:01.336 --> 03:03.081
- but I think they were having...
- Hey, do you want

03:03.105 --> 03:04.505
to-to walk you to home?

03:04.573 --> 03:07.808
- Mm. Yeah. Sure. Let me just...
- Nah.

03:07.877 --> 03:10.288
- Just leave it. Yeah. Let's just go.
- No, I should clean it up.

03:10.312 --> 03:11.923
- No, seriously, leave it.
- It'll only take a second.

03:11.947 --> 03:13.679
No, the poop's great.
It's good on our lawn.

03:13.748 --> 03:15.581
Ooh, wooh, wooh...

03:15.650 --> 03:17.884
You know what?

03:17.953 --> 03:20.486
Actually, I'm just
gonna leave this poop.

03:20.555 --> 03:21.888
So...

03:25.928 --> 03:27.660
Oh, Dad, thank you so much for the help.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.263
So funny. I'm really glad you're back.

03:30.332 --> 03:31.531
Aw, come on!

03:31.599 --> 03:34.000
Oh, do I see a little smile?

03:34.069 --> 03:35.501
Maybe it wasn't funny.

03:35.570 --> 03:37.270
It feels funny when I'm doing it.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.608
Mm-hmm. That's undeniable.

03:42.677 --> 03:44.688
Why would you need hand
dryers? Let's say you got a sackful

03:44.712 --> 03:46.457
of severed hands, okay,
but some of them are still wet,

03:46.481 --> 03:47.825
'cause they're covered in the tears

03:47.849 --> 03:50.282
of the children that they were holding.

03:50.351 --> 03:52.418
No. You're a psycho!

03:52.487 --> 03:54.620
Zorn, I am starting to get the sense

03:54.689 --> 03:56.656
you have no idea what you're doing.

03:56.724 --> 03:59.126
But the important thing
is I'm having fun, right?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.940
No. That's not the thing.
The thing is to make a sale,

04:01.963 --> 04:03.941
- and you have not made one.
- And yet I'm still having fun,

04:03.965 --> 04:05.531
which I think speaks towards my spirit.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.199
Have you tried using the script?

04:07.268 --> 04:09.869
It can be pretty
persuasive. Todd already landed

04:09.938 --> 04:12.438
two new accounts using
that script last week.

04:12.507 --> 04:14.318
Yeah, the script. I
mean, it's good, it's good.

04:14.342 --> 04:16.909
It's a great template. But, you
know, I have a tendency to feel

04:16.978 --> 04:19.711
that I get my best results
when I'm just winging it.

04:19.779 --> 04:21.713
Make a sale, or I'm gonna fire you.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.582
Definitely. You're the boss, my man.

04:26.887 --> 04:28.386
I got a...

04:28.455 --> 04:29.955
Huh? Yeah.

04:30.023 --> 04:31.957
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

04:32.025 --> 04:33.825
- Uh, I was calling to apologize.
- For what?

04:33.894 --> 04:35.271
For yesterday, or just,
like, my entire childhood?

04:35.295 --> 04:36.728
No, no, no, just for yesterday.

04:36.797 --> 04:38.475
Look, and I've also
been thinking, there is

04:38.499 --> 04:40.331
an area I might be helpful
to you, you know.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.000
You seem to be keen on a certain

04:42.068 --> 04:43.602
elfish, waifish Asian maiden.

04:43.670 --> 04:45.247
- Am I right?
- Dad, it's fine. I don't really want...

04:45.271 --> 04:47.806
Alangulon, listen, I don't mean
to brag here, but I've been

04:47.875 --> 04:49.352
with a lot of women
over the years, okay?

04:49.376 --> 04:50.586
We're talking Tora, Princess of Light,

04:50.610 --> 04:51.690
Yonna, Princess of Victory,

04:51.744 --> 04:53.811
Helena, Princess of, um...

04:53.880 --> 04:56.547
Damn it. I don't even remember
what she was princess of,

04:56.616 --> 04:58.682
- I was so darn wasted.
- Can I...

04:58.751 --> 05:00.217
I got to go. Wha-What's up?

05:00.285 --> 05:01.463
Doesn't matter. Look, what I've learned

05:01.487 --> 05:03.286
is that to get a woman, son,

05:03.355 --> 05:06.089
all you have to do is offer
her some Corn Nuts.

05:06.158 --> 05:07.591
- Corn Nuts.
- Trust me, son,

05:07.660 --> 05:09.960
chicks love Corn Nuts.
It makes all the sense

05:10.029 --> 05:11.673
- in the world... I mean,
they're crunchy... - Great.

05:11.697 --> 05:12.875
Okay, I got to go. I'm at school. Bye.

05:12.899 --> 05:15.766
And the bag is in...

05:15.835 --> 05:18.602
It's not your garage anymore, Zorn.

05:18.671 --> 05:21.304
Craig and I are
getting married. Get over it.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.673
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey. - Hey, Alan.

05:23.742 --> 05:25.019
Hey, your dad called this morning

05:25.043 --> 05:26.442
to apologize... Did he reach you?

05:26.511 --> 05:27.877
Yeah, he called, and then he tried

05:27.946 --> 05:29.546
to give me advice about girls.

05:29.614 --> 05:31.681
Your dad? First of all,

05:31.750 --> 05:34.350
you'd come to me if you needed
advice about girls.

05:34.419 --> 05:35.763
- Nope.
- And second of all, he calls it

05:35.787 --> 05:38.054
- a "vajiba."
- Aah! Don't say that.

05:38.122 --> 05:39.622
- Well...
- Hey, Craig, can I use that

05:39.691 --> 05:40.990
once you're finished grading?

05:41.059 --> 05:42.458
Uh, not "grading," Alan.

05:42.527 --> 05:44.827
Grading implies the traditional
letter system,

05:44.896 --> 05:46.896
which, as you know, I find limiting.

05:46.965 --> 05:49.666
For instance, this student
just scored a P7.

05:49.734 --> 05:50.663
Is that like an A?

05:50.688 --> 05:53.060
No, Alan, it's not like an A.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.503
- Is it like an A-minus?
- Yes.

05:54.573 --> 05:56.940
Ooh. What if we take

05:57.008 --> 05:58.740
the boxes to him?

05:58.809 --> 06:01.342
Dad's boxes? He still
hasn't picked up that crap?

06:01.411 --> 06:03.612
Well, in Zorn's defense,
he did take the Game Boy.

06:03.681 --> 06:05.614
You know, his
apartment is on the way to that

06:05.683 --> 06:07.182
estate sale you wanted to go to.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.952
Oh, I love going
through dead people's things.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.187
Honey, could you move the
boxes into your car?

06:12.255 --> 06:13.889
You'd get a P7 in my book.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.390
Maybe even a P8.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.492
A C?

06:20.864 --> 06:22.831
Mm. Ah...

06:23.968 --> 06:26.334
- Water.
- What?

06:26.403 --> 06:27.836
I just said "water."

06:27.905 --> 06:31.006
Yeah. That's what it is.

06:32.742 --> 06:35.276
Water, water, lots of drops to drink.

06:35.345 --> 06:37.612
- You know? With the...
- Yeah.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.415
- You can drink it. You got to have it.
- Okay.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.783
Uh... hey, Nancy.

06:42.852 --> 06:47.288
Uh, do you want some Corn Nuts?

06:48.758 --> 06:50.258
Corn Nuts?

06:50.327 --> 06:51.759
Yeah.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.295
Yeah. Sure. I love Corn Nuts.

06:54.364 --> 06:55.963
Oh.

06:56.032 --> 06:57.665
Really?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.100
Do you have any?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.768
Uh-uh.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.437
Oh.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.771
- Ah.
- 'Cause...

07:04.840 --> 07:06.440
- Where did they go?
- You asked me.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.408
Where did the Corn Nuts go?

07:08.477 --> 07:10.244
Okay. Well...

07:10.312 --> 07:12.646
I have to get to class, so...

07:12.714 --> 07:14.914
- See ya.
- Hey, yeah,

07:14.983 --> 07:16.750
I do, too.

07:21.823 --> 07:24.124
Hey, Alangulon! All right!

07:24.193 --> 07:25.825
Get on in here, buddy. Come on in.

07:25.894 --> 07:27.294
Make yourself at home.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.196
So, what do you think?
I know it kind of looks

07:29.265 --> 07:30.742
- like a, uh...
- A place where crackheads

07:30.766 --> 07:33.167
- go to have sex? Yeah.
- Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.347
Hey, can I get you
anything? You know, a glass of water,

07:35.371 --> 07:37.670
maybe, or some butter? Oh,
you know, I got a big old bag

07:37.738 --> 07:39.416
- of warm meat in the bathroom sink.
- Uh, that's okay.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.507
I'm kind of trying to
cut back on warm sink meat.

07:41.576 --> 07:43.656
All right. Well, I got
some cold stuff in the toilet.

07:43.711 --> 07:44.988
Eh, you know what? Doesn't matter.

07:45.012 --> 07:46.372
Uh, what'd you want to talk about?

07:46.414 --> 07:49.182
I just, uh... So
that-that Corn Nuts thing worked.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.350
- How did you know that?
- Like I said,

07:51.419 --> 07:53.186
I'm no stranger to feminality, okay?

07:53.254 --> 07:56.689
I just understand women on a
deeper level than most men.

07:56.757 --> 07:58.402
I listen. You know,
that's really a big part of it.

07:58.426 --> 08:00.459
You just got to listen. No, I'm kidding!

08:00.528 --> 08:02.161
I'm... I'm screwing with you.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.797
No, I use the Stone of Sight.

08:04.865 --> 08:07.682
What is that, like, a...
is that a Web site?

08:07.683 --> 08:08.512
Ah, here, check it out.

08:08.536 --> 08:09.746
Okay, all right, what you want to do,

08:09.770 --> 08:10.914
you want to hold it up in front of you,

08:10.938 --> 08:12.248
now hold it there, you want to keep it

08:12.272 --> 08:13.984
- straight there, just so can...
- Like this?

08:14.008 --> 08:15.318
Okay, now, you want
to look through here.

08:15.342 --> 08:16.653
All right, good. Now repeat after me.

08:16.677 --> 08:18.310
- Show me...
- Show me...

08:18.378 --> 08:20.312
the elfish, waifish Asian maiden.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.847
...the elfish, wai... Wait.

08:21.916 --> 08:25.017
- Nancy? What is this?
- Come on, just say it.

08:28.189 --> 08:29.788
Show me Nancy.

08:32.292 --> 08:35.828
Guys, I have your salmon right here.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.330
Pretty cool, right? Hmm? Yeah?

08:38.398 --> 08:40.866
Oh, and just so you know, it's
dangerous in the hands of evil.

08:42.148 --> 08:43.484
You stalking her.

08:43.514 --> 08:44.980
Nah-ah. No. I'm not stalking her.

08:45.049 --> 08:47.482
I-I'm just watching her every move.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.185
- That's stalking!
- What?

08:49.253 --> 08:50.920
I'm just trying to help you so that

08:50.988 --> 08:52.788
you'll think I'm an
awesome dad and then,

08:52.857 --> 08:54.334
I don't know, we'll sneak
into a ball game together

08:54.358 --> 08:56.758
and dump beer on people's heads
and fight the security.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.161
- I mean, is that a crime?
- Yes, those are all crimes.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.130
Excuse me for not knowing all the crimes

09:01.199 --> 09:03.597
in all the world, okay?

09:03.666 --> 09:05.366
All right, so you don't want to know

09:05.435 --> 09:07.902
that her favorite movie
is Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

09:07.971 --> 09:10.104
Or that she prefers short hair on guys

09:10.173 --> 09:13.241
and thinks that white V-neck
T-shirts are crazy hot.

09:14.911 --> 09:17.445
- She said that?
- Yeah. I mean, unless

09:17.513 --> 09:18.858
she was lying to
her best friend Shannon,

09:18.882 --> 09:20.414
which I really don't think she would.

09:20.483 --> 09:22.016
Although, come to think about it,

09:22.085 --> 09:24.018
when Shannon got home
last night, she was talking

09:24.087 --> 09:27.255
to Joni Perkins... you know,
Butt-Crack Joni, right?

09:27.324 --> 09:29.958
- I don't know her personally.
- Like, pull your jeans up, lady.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.492
- Nobody needs to see that.
- Okay.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.194
Let me just, like, think...

09:33.263 --> 09:35.330
Okay, if I'm not aware
of what you're doing,

09:35.398 --> 09:36.764
like, if you don't tell me,

09:36.833 --> 09:38.465
- Mm-hmm.
- Then it's just basically

09:38.533 --> 09:40.868
like I... it's like I guessed.

09:40.936 --> 09:42.635
Sure. Yeah, no, rationalize away.

09:42.704 --> 09:43.915
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm just getting pointers

09:43.939 --> 09:45.672
from my dad on girls, right?

09:45.741 --> 09:47.040
God, it's so cool when you can

09:47.109 --> 09:49.076
really see yourself in your child.

09:49.144 --> 09:52.479
Nature is a... well,
it's just an amazing thing.

09:58.787 --> 10:02.655
Ooh. Ooh.

10:06.896 --> 10:08.595
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.583
I'm not finished with
that page yet. Don't... Aw.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.967
Likes... the way Rooney Mara wore it.

10:15.036 --> 10:16.869
Dislikes the way Khloe Kardashian...

10:16.938 --> 10:19.405
Or however you
spell that... Wore it. Okay.

10:19.473 --> 10:21.573
Man, I remember when stalking
used to be fun.

10:21.642 --> 10:24.877
Oh, you know what? Show me
the punk who stole my phone.

10:24.946 --> 10:27.446
Man, what the...?

10:27.515 --> 10:28.881
Oh, boy.

10:28.950 --> 10:31.050
Of course... It was in the coin pocket.

10:31.119 --> 10:32.818
I never use that little guy.

10:32.887 --> 10:35.821
Mm. Now I got to go back
and apologize to that valet.

10:35.890 --> 10:37.924
Hey.

10:37.992 --> 10:40.259
This is actually pretty cool.
Can't believe I've never...

10:40.328 --> 10:42.228
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, what is that?

10:42.297 --> 10:43.607
You know what? Whatever.

10:43.631 --> 10:45.431
Like Craig doesn't have a bald spot.

10:45.499 --> 10:46.865
Show me Craig.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.867
Oh, brother.

10:48.936 --> 10:51.770
"Oh, look at me cycling
with my fiancée.

10:51.839 --> 10:53.316
"'Cause we're one of those
couples that enjoy

10:53.340 --> 10:55.707
spending time together."
Give me a break.

10:55.776 --> 10:58.510
Todd! Hey! Can I ask you a question?

10:58.579 --> 11:01.279
- Actually, I'm kind of in a...
- Yeah. How do you make a sale?

11:01.348 --> 11:04.750
Well, the easiest way is to
start with someone you know.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.251
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh, Todd! Todd!

11:07.988 --> 11:09.922
Would you want to buy
some soap dispensers?

11:11.124 --> 11:12.891
Todd, wait!

11:14.000 --> 11:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:33.279 --> 11:35.446
- Hey.
- Huh?

11:35.515 --> 11:36.848
What?!

11:36.916 --> 11:39.484
- Do you shop here?
- Here? Oh,

11:39.552 --> 11:41.051
yeah, I love this place.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.687
It's super funky, you know?

11:42.755 --> 11:44.489
It's, like... I feel
like vintage clothing

11:44.557 --> 11:46.223
really has, like, a story to tell.

11:46.292 --> 11:48.626
I literally said the same
thing this morning.

11:48.695 --> 11:50.862
Wow. Huh. Yeah, you know
what, sometimes, uh,

11:50.930 --> 11:52.863
"life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop

11:52.931 --> 11:54.430
and look around once in a while,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.099
- you can miss it."
- Ferris Bueller.

11:56.167 --> 11:58.401
Yeah. It's, like, my favorite movie.

11:58.470 --> 12:00.036
It's my favorite movie.

12:00.105 --> 12:01.337
No way!

12:01.406 --> 12:03.139
- Crazy.
- Shannon,

12:03.208 --> 12:05.141
uh, this is, uh, my friend, Alan.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.143
This is Shannon, by the way.

12:07.212 --> 12:10.279
"Creepy Alan"? With the psycho dad?

12:10.348 --> 12:13.449
- Different Alan.
- Whatever.

12:13.519 --> 12:14.929
I'm gonna go see if any
of the stuff from the '80s

12:14.953 --> 12:16.686
still has coke in the pockets.

12:16.755 --> 12:18.600
You know, I, I on... I only
just met her just now,

12:18.624 --> 12:20.390
but I've seen her around school a bunch,

12:20.458 --> 12:22.737
and she's, like, definitely
changed a lot in the last year,

12:22.761 --> 12:24.127
- you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

12:24.195 --> 12:25.773
She was really into
volleyball last year,

12:25.797 --> 12:28.264
- but now she's...
- Now she's like a total stoner.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.933
You know, it's, like,
one beaded braid no make Dem

12:31.002 --> 12:33.069
a Rasta!

12:33.138 --> 12:35.098
Hey, this is totally random,
but, uh, next weekend

12:35.140 --> 12:36.939
I have two tickets to see this band,

12:37.008 --> 12:38.574
Pineapple Candy. I don't know if you're

12:38.643 --> 12:40.510
- into them at all...
- Are you serious?

12:40.578 --> 12:42.111
Yes!

12:46.584 --> 12:48.418
Oh, you're kidding me.

12:48.486 --> 12:51.054
You're kidding me.

12:51.122 --> 12:52.922
Nope! No!

12:52.990 --> 12:54.723
- Hey, hey, no, no.
- Uh-oh, busted.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.670
- Take those back!
- Oh, come on, Edie, you don't

12:56.694 --> 12:58.794
actually want bikes in your
garage. That's insane.

12:58.863 --> 13:01.196
- I mean, bikes?
- Yeah, bikes. My bike,

13:01.265 --> 13:03.565
Craig's bike,
together, just the two of them.

13:03.633 --> 13:06.435
Hey, Edie, you're really
gonna keep pretending like...

13:06.503 --> 13:08.370
this isn't happening?

13:08.439 --> 13:09.904
Like what isn't happening?

13:09.973 --> 13:11.739
Come on, I've had a lot of sex, Edie.

13:11.808 --> 13:14.087
I've seen a lot of
vajibas, and a lot of women

13:14.111 --> 13:15.391
have seen my pebis, you hear me?

13:15.446 --> 13:16.722
- I know what I'm talking about.
- I really

13:16.746 --> 13:18.186
don't want to hear about your pebis.

13:18.248 --> 13:20.115
All right, well, if I'm
so wrong about us,

13:20.184 --> 13:22.184
then how come you
still have your Zorn tattoo?

13:22.252 --> 13:23.851
I don't have that Zorn tattoo.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.288
Edie, I've seen it.

13:26.356 --> 13:29.524
How... have you...

13:29.593 --> 13:31.369
The Stone of Sight?!

13:32.727 --> 13:36.097
- Oh... my... God!
- Oh, okay, so now you want

13:36.165 --> 13:37.565
my stuff in your house.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.100
I can't believe this.

13:39.168 --> 13:40.767
Did you spy on me in the shower?

13:40.836 --> 13:43.014
The real outrage here should
be the length of your showers.

13:43.038 --> 13:44.271
We are in a drought, Edie.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.573
It is not a joke.

13:45.641 --> 13:47.408
- Is that a safe?
- Yes.

13:47.477 --> 13:49.510
- Craig got it for his answer keys.
- Edie,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.012
I need the stone, okay? I can't
tell you why, but trust me.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.847
Plus, plus, it is dangerous

13:53.916 --> 13:56.750
- in the hands of evil.
- You are the hands of evil!

13:56.819 --> 13:59.653
Okay, fine. You think some
little safe is gonna stop me?

13:59.722 --> 14:02.055
I... am... Zorn!

14:05.328 --> 14:06.560
Zero, zero, zero, zero.

14:06.629 --> 14:08.561
Damn. Zero, zero, zero, one.

14:08.631 --> 14:10.296
Damn. Zero, zero, zero, two.

14:10.365 --> 14:12.680
Damn. Zero, zero, zero, three.

14:12.681 --> 14:13.767
Damn.

14:14.242 --> 14:15.952
Yeah, I guess it's, like, aâa date.

14:16.109 --> 14:18.000
Could you maybe give me
some pointers on what

14:18.001 --> 14:19.989
girls think is their favorite
restaurant in town?

14:20.013 --> 14:21.346
Well, yeah, but, son, I...

14:21.415 --> 14:22.880
Could you maybe think about it soon?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.627
So I can make reservations
before the show?

14:24.651 --> 14:26.611
Sure, no, no, yeah,
but-but here's the thing, I...

14:26.652 --> 14:28.897
Definitely think about it when
she's got her clothes on, okay?

14:28.921 --> 14:29.809
Hey, thanks, Dad,

14:29.810 --> 14:31.933
- for, um, you know...
- Hey! But...

14:31.957 --> 14:33.924
My pleasure, son.

14:33.992 --> 14:36.226
Was that a client?

14:36.295 --> 14:37.561
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it was.

14:38.864 --> 14:41.098
Zorn, I don't want to have to fire you.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.567
Just... use the script, make a sale.

14:43.635 --> 14:45.302
I know. I know. No, and I'm super close.

14:45.371 --> 14:47.449
It's just, um, well, you know,
I have this perfect way

14:47.473 --> 14:49.384
to connect with this client,
and, uh, I mean,

14:49.385 --> 14:51.873
he was totally
appreciating me. I mean, it was amazing.

14:51.874 --> 14:54.611
And then, you know, I-I
lost it, and-and now I'm afraid

14:54.680 --> 14:56.813
I'm gonna lose him, and I... I mean,

14:56.882 --> 14:59.249
God, I... I just love him
so much, you know, it's...

14:59.318 --> 15:01.717
Okay. Okay. I know...

15:01.786 --> 15:04.520
all about this way of connecting
with a client,

15:04.589 --> 15:08.757
and... trust me, it does not work out.

15:08.826 --> 15:11.708
I mean, there's a line there,
there's temptation.

15:11.985 --> 15:13.985
You know, just don't give in to it.

15:14.053 --> 15:15.486
Oh, gosh, I think your best bet

15:15.554 --> 15:17.155
would just be to end it, you know?

15:17.223 --> 15:18.956
You got to go over there in person,

15:19.025 --> 15:20.825
get the job done, and get out of there.

15:20.894 --> 15:23.161
Who knows? Maybe if it
doesn't end too badly,

15:23.229 --> 15:24.762
you could still make that sale.

15:24.831 --> 15:26.210
In person.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.911
Well, I warned him. Now his
stuff is in the trash.

15:28.935 --> 15:32.369
- I mean, that is on him.
- Oh. Y-You got a thing

15:32.438 --> 15:34.038
on your...

15:34.107 --> 15:35.884
- Oh! Get it off!
- Okay,

15:35.908 --> 15:37.974
- Kill it!
- Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.

15:38.043 --> 15:40.311
I'm not gonna kill it.
It's just a little...

15:44.583 --> 15:46.183
Oh, my God!

15:46.251 --> 15:48.985
Whew!

15:49.054 --> 15:51.522
Look, as childish

15:51.590 --> 15:53.857
and invasive as Zorn can be,

15:53.926 --> 15:56.527
you can't force someone to move on.

15:56.595 --> 15:58.595
You got to stop
letting it drive you crazy.

15:58.664 --> 15:59.863
Just let it go.

15:59.932 --> 16:02.165
Come on.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.601
Look,

16:04.670 --> 16:06.269
could I get upset about the tattoo

16:06.339 --> 16:08.138
that you still have on your behind?

16:08.207 --> 16:09.373
Sure.

16:09.442 --> 16:10.640
Do I?

16:10.709 --> 16:12.475
Sometimes. Privately.

16:12.544 --> 16:14.677
- You know it means nothing to me.
- I know,

16:14.746 --> 16:16.512
and I try not to let it torment me,

16:16.581 --> 16:18.381
which is why I prefer missionary.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.050
You know what? You're right.

16:20.118 --> 16:22.552
- I should just let it go.
- Yeah.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.855
There is laser removal.

16:26.391 --> 16:27.490
Hmm.

16:27.559 --> 16:29.726
Well, let's see what else we got here.

16:29.794 --> 16:31.228
Let's see. What?

16:31.296 --> 16:32.662
- Pretty creepy, man.
- Hey,

16:32.731 --> 16:34.231
you want your five stars or not?

16:34.299 --> 16:36.179
Wait, hold on. Who is that?
Is that her brother?

16:36.235 --> 16:38.935
- Dude, I don't know.
- What the hell?

16:39.004 --> 16:42.005
Wow. And people say
Zephyrians are the ones with the deviant

16:42.074 --> 16:43.673
sexual impulses, huh?

16:43.742 --> 16:45.608
Well, maybe it's not her brother.

16:45.677 --> 16:47.410
- Hey!
- Why can't I roll this window up?

16:47.479 --> 16:48.911
It's busted, man.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.825
- Just don't worry about it.
- Ah! This car sucks, dude.

16:50.849 --> 16:52.649
- Hey, take it down a notch.
- Can I help you?

16:52.684 --> 16:54.884
- Oh, no, no, no, we're good, thank you.
- Really?

16:54.952 --> 16:56.497
- You're good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're just, uh,

16:56.521 --> 16:58.131
we were, um, yeah,
we're looking for an address,

16:58.155 --> 17:00.556
but I-I think we're on the
wrong street, so, uh...

17:00.625 --> 17:03.359
- I saw you urinate on my tree.
- Oh, you saw that?

17:03.428 --> 17:05.406
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.
It was kind of an emergency.

17:05.430 --> 17:07.563
But, hey, we're about
to take off, so just...

17:07.632 --> 17:08.876
Yeah, I just want to put
this out there, man.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.767
I do not know this guy at all.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.780
I picked him up earlier.
He was drinking in the park.

17:12.804 --> 17:14.236
- I was having a beer.
- Yeah.

17:14.305 --> 17:15.605
It was more than a beer.

17:15.673 --> 17:17.172
And now you're at four stars, Brian.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.917
- You want to make it three?
- You knocked over

17:18.942 --> 17:21.777
- my eucalyptus tree!
- What? I got a powerful stream.

17:21.845 --> 17:24.546
Hell, I once
pee-blasted a Glombeast off a cliff.

17:24.615 --> 17:26.693
Maybe back in Vietnam or wherever,
this sort of thing...

17:26.717 --> 17:29.885
Vietnam? Vietnam?

17:29.953 --> 17:31.787
Wh-Why would you say that? I mean

17:31.855 --> 17:34.087
do I look Vietnamese to you, seriously?

17:34.088 --> 17:35.046
Dude, that's racist.

17:35.047 --> 17:36.425
Brian, turn the car on. Let's go.

17:41.529 --> 17:43.295
Hey, buddy. You
weren't answering your phone,

17:43.364 --> 17:44.964
so I figured I'd pop by.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.934
Okay.

17:48.002 --> 17:51.003
So anyway, I've, uh, got
some fatherly advice for you.

17:51.072 --> 17:53.673
Oh, fatherly advice?
This is gonna be really cool.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.352
- Can't wait.
- Well, I'm feeling like maybe

17:55.376 --> 17:57.187
things aren't gonna
work out for you and Nancy.

17:57.211 --> 17:59.612
It's just, um, I mean,
you could do better.

17:59.681 --> 18:01.201
Oh, you think I can do better? Really?

18:01.248 --> 18:02.949
Oh, my gosh. My dad thinks that?

18:03.017 --> 18:05.584
If I'm being honest, I think
she might be prone to incest.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.786
Okay, so it's definitely not because

18:07.855 --> 18:10.021
you went over to
her house to spy on her,

18:10.090 --> 18:11.656
and insulted her dad to the point

18:11.725 --> 18:13.492
where he kicked a dent in your car?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.093
Okay, all right, that did not happen.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.661
Yes, it did! I saw you!

18:16.730 --> 18:19.464
- You spied on me?
- Yeah. I used the Stone of Sight.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.100
Got it out of Craig's
safe... He says the code out loud

18:22.168 --> 18:24.135
when he types it in.
Zero, zero, zero, six.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.871
Are you kidding me?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.372
Okay, well, you know what?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.173
I think the best thing
is probably for me

18:29.242 --> 18:31.688
to stop trying to help, I
always seem to be making things worse.

18:31.712 --> 18:33.512
Well, it's not like it matters.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.715
I saw she has a boyfriend
she didn't tell me about, so...

18:36.783 --> 18:39.217
that's what really sucks in the end.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.005
You know, sometimes
you really like someone,

18:41.054 --> 18:43.221
and you talk a big game like
it's, it's gonna work out,

18:43.289 --> 18:45.490
but the fact is she's with someone else.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.025
And it sucks.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.060
I mean, it sucks.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.362
I mean, I get it, you know?
You wish you could just

18:51.431 --> 18:54.399
rip off the new guy's nose
and break off his finger

18:54.467 --> 18:56.645
and stick it where his nose used
to be and then just punch him

18:56.669 --> 18:58.002
in his stupid bicycle face!

18:58.071 --> 18:59.303
I can see the headline now:

18:59.372 --> 19:01.239
"Man with Tiniest Genitals Dies,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.508
World Rejoices."

19:03.576 --> 19:06.244
But then, I don't know,
once you start to...

19:06.312 --> 19:07.978
let go and move on, who knows?

19:08.048 --> 19:09.514
I mean, maybe it gets better.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.050
Yeah, you're right.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.750
Hey, thanks, Dad.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.387
It's really nice to finally have,

19:17.456 --> 19:19.389
like, an actual conversation, you know,

19:19.458 --> 19:21.724
where we can, like, talk to each o...

19:25.797 --> 19:27.164
Yeah. It's great,

19:27.232 --> 19:28.665
- super great to...
- Mm-hmm.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.333
Finally have a...

19:30.402 --> 19:32.335
one-on-one
conversation back and forth, where...

19:32.336 --> 19:33.336
one-on-one conversation
back and forth, where...

19:32.404 --> 19:33.915
- Yeah, totally.
- ...you're really listening

19:33.939 --> 19:35.283
- Listening.
- To everything I'm saying,

19:35.307 --> 19:37.040
- and really processing...
- Active process.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.942
All right, well, here we go.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.551
Nah, it's for the best.

19:47.619 --> 19:50.052
There are just too many
evil hands in the world.

19:50.121 --> 19:53.389
Mainly yours. But thank you
for finally moving your boxes.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.102
Yeah, I know, it's weird.
It's, like, we're, uh...

19:55.126 --> 19:56.603
like we're officially
divorced now, I guess.

19:56.627 --> 19:58.627
Hey, can you, uh...

19:58.696 --> 20:01.930
- can you give us a minute?
- Oh.

20:01.999 --> 20:04.900
Listen, uh, Craig, I, uh,
I owe you an apology.

20:04.969 --> 20:07.203
How about we hit the old reset button?

20:07.271 --> 20:09.305
I'd like that, Zorn.

20:10.874 --> 20:13.542
Hello. I'm Zorn from
Sanitation Solutions.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.722
Do you have a second to talk
about how satisfied you are

20:15.746 --> 20:17.846
with your current
bathroom products supplier?

20:17.915 --> 20:19.215
Yeah.

20:19.283 --> 20:21.383
$600 on soap dispensers?

20:21.452 --> 20:23.218
I know. It was impulsive.

20:23.286 --> 20:24.953
What the hell were you thinking?

20:25.022 --> 20:27.222
Well, well, well, trouble in paradise.

20:27.290 --> 20:30.191
Zorn, how you make the puppets dance.

20:30.260 --> 20:33.228
Look, honestly, I
just feel sorry for Zorn.

20:33.296 --> 20:35.041
- Wait, wait. Hold on.
- He lost you, he lives in squalor,

20:35.065 --> 20:37.365
the bangs are not working.

20:37.434 --> 20:40.502
I just thought he
needed a win for a change.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.771
Well, when you say it
like that, that's...

20:42.840 --> 20:44.250
Wait a second, why are
the puppets not dancing

20:44.274 --> 20:45.585
- the way I want them to dance?
- ...unusual.

20:45.609 --> 20:47.609
- You're an amazing person.
- No!

20:49.312 --> 20:51.680
Stupid Stone! Come on! Stupid!
