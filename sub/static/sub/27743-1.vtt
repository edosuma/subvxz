-[Chase] In just the last few weeks,

00:17.767 --> 00:21.855
this Carmen Sandiego has managed
to rob millions of euros combined

00:21.938 --> 00:25.358
from a Swiss bank,
a high-end art gallery in Cairo,

00:25.442 --> 00:27.360
and a Shanghai amusement park.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.571
Before vanishing without a trace.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.698
Headquarters has yet to discern
any pattern

00:32.032 --> 00:36.327
except that our perpetrator
always wears a scarlet coat and fedora

00:36.411 --> 00:37.996
and seems to announce her crimes

00:38.079 --> 00:40.999
by making random
public appearances beforehand.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.544
[Chase] Such as the nearby café sighting
earlier today.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.965
So we must ask ourselves,
who in the world <i>is</i> Carmen Sandiego?

00:49.048 --> 00:51.092
Why would a thief
draw attention to herself

00:51.176 --> 00:53.762
by leaving clues and wearing bold colors?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.097
Perhaps stealing's a game to her.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.224
[scoffs] Ha! The game is over.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.644
She is in my jurisdiction now,
though I question why.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.439
Poitiers is rich with medieval history.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.858
Perhaps she is targeting
a priceless antique

01:06.941 --> 01:09.778
or historic artifact
from one of its many churches, or--

01:09.861 --> 01:10.737
[tires screech]

01:11.738 --> 01:15.450
Ms. Argent, you are an agent of Interpol,
not a museum guide.

01:15.658 --> 01:19.454
So you may stop sharing dull facts
about boring things.

01:19.537 --> 01:22.332
You have been on the force
merely a fortnight, have you not?

01:22.999 --> 01:24.417
You have so much to learn,

01:24.626 --> 01:26.294
and since you have been assigned
to my department,

01:26.377 --> 01:27.212
Um, uh...

01:27.295 --> 01:30.715
I, Chase Devineaux, will be your teacher.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.051
-Inspector Devineaux, sir--
-Nuh-uh.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.679
Sit back, watch,
and learn how to catch a thief.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.764
She's right there!

01:37.847 --> 01:38.723
Huh?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.156
And radio for assistance?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.742
No, the crimson ghost is mine!

02:07.210 --> 02:08.920
On top of the world.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.131

you're on board.

-How's my temperature?
<i>-Warm, Red.</i>

09:04.085 --> 09:05.586
Driving aggressively, of course.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.090
Well, I'm really not much
of a math detective,

09:09.173 --> 09:12.635
but I suppose it depends
upon how many stops the train makes

09:12.718 --> 09:14.345
and for how long at each.

09:14.428 --> 09:18.266
Mm-hmm. Then perhaps I shall catch
this Little Red Robbing Hood.

And you didn't really think
I'd take any of your bait

without checking for a tracking device,
did you, Gray?

I am Coach Brunt,

11:04.622 --> 11:08.000
Rule number one--
no contact with the outside world.

That means no
portable electronic devices allowed.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.890
Ain't that right, Lambkins?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.871
You really schooled me the day we met.

I thought you should know
who you were dealing with.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.335
Well, it seems I still don't know.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.713
The slick red hat, the exotic new name.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.841
Who are you, really?

11:57.258 --> 12:00.010
A professional thief, just like you.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.013
No, you weren't like the rest of us.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.766
How did you ever wind up in crime school?

Your clock runs out when we reach Paris.
Make it count.

12:14.692 --> 12:18.362
From what I've been told,
I was found as a baby,

12:18.487 --> 12:22.575
abandoned by the side of a road
just outside Buenos Aires, Argentina.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.079

<i>to a school for thieves.</i>

12:36.755 --> 12:38.299
<i>It was no grade school,</i>

12:38.382 --> 12:42.011
<i>but I was homeschooled</i>
<i>by a revolving door of nannies.</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:44.722
<i>Some taught me how to read and write,</i>

12:44.972 --> 12:47.766

<i>about the diverse places they were from.</i>

13:33.604 --> 13:34.688
[Carmen laughs]

13:34.772 --> 13:35.940
Why, you--!

13:36.440 --> 13:37.399
[gasps] Uh-oh.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.529
<i>Sure, the Campus of Crime</i>
<i>was no place for children,</i>

13:41.737 --> 13:43.948
<i>but I never once felt</i>
<i>like I was in danger.</i>

13:44.031 --> 13:44.907
[grunts]

13:45.950 --> 13:46.784
[groans]

13:48.619 --> 13:51.747
<i>I was part of the family.</i>
<i>I had protection.</i>

13:51.830 --> 13:53.040
[Brunt] Problem here?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.376
[groans, mutters]

13:55.668 --> 13:56.585
[crackling]

13:57.336 --> 13:58.295
[man] Ugh!

13:58.796 --> 14:00.464
[squeaking]

14:06.303 --> 14:07.179
[beeping]

14:07.263 --> 14:09.348
[Carmen] <i>I never learned</i>
<i>who found me as a baby.</i>

14:09.431 --> 14:12.059
Oh, let's get you a cupcake, sugar pie.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.354
<i>But I always suspected it was Coach Brunt.</i>

14:22.152 --> 14:24.280
<i>The island was my world.</i>

14:24.363 --> 14:26.740
<i>For all I knew, the Earth was square.</i>

14:29.368 --> 14:31.328
<i>There was no right or wrong.</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:34.623
<i>Thievery was a competition, a game.</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:39.795
<i>One I was ready to play for real.</i>

14:43.048 --> 14:45.718
<i>I couldn't bear watching 40 thieves</i>
<i>graduate from the academy</i>

14:45.801 --> 14:47.303
<i>year after year.</i>

14:47.803 --> 14:50.973
<i>I wanted to get out there</i>
<i>and be one of those thieves already!</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:52.016
[cell phone buzzing]

14:53.851 --> 14:55.060
Whoa! [thumps]

14:55.144 --> 14:58.022
[buzzing continues]

14:58.772 --> 14:59.607
[grunts]

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734
[buzzing]

15:03.193 --> 15:04.278
A white hat?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.906
[beeps]

15:07.656 --> 15:11.452
"Better beef up your security. I got in."

15:13.829 --> 15:17.416
"Got in"? Where? Here?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.961
[phone ringing]

15:22.504 --> 15:24.798
-[Player] <i>Hello?</i>
-He-- hello?

15:25.049 --> 15:25.966
Who is this?

15:26.383 --> 15:29.011
-Black Sheep.
<i>-Come on, what's your real name?</i>

15:29.094 --> 15:31.013
-Black Sheep.
<i>-Okay.</i>

15:31.180 --> 15:32.389
Usernames work.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.850
You can call me... Player.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.685
<i>Do you really where a white hat?</i>

15:36.769 --> 15:39.855
Uh, why? You've never heard
of "white hat hackers"?

15:40.022 --> 15:40.856
That's a thing?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.901
<i>I have wicked hacking skills,</i>
<i>but I use them for good.</i>

15:43.984 --> 15:45.611
Okay, that doesn't even make sense.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.029
Sure, it does.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.365
I just hacked through 27 layers
of encryption.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.575
So, who do I inform over there
about the weak link

15:51.659 --> 15:53.327
so you can upgrade your security?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.246
Are you punking me?
Where are you calling from?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.999
-My room in Niagara Falls.
-[Black Sheep gasps]

15:59.083 --> 16:01.585
<i>-Seriously? Which side of the falls?</i>
-Canadian.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.545
You're in Ontario?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.965
<i>Whoa, you really know your geography.</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
-What's it like there?
<i>-It's all right.</i>

16:08.509 --> 16:11.387
<i>We have computers, and Internet, and...</i>

16:11.595 --> 16:13.430
<i>Hey, where in the world are you?</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:15.015
School.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.353
<i>What kind of school</i>
<i>needs 27 layers of encryption?</i>

16:21.313 --> 16:24.066
[Carmen] <i>Making contact with someone</i>
<i>from the outside world</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:26.068
<i>was just the push I needed.</i>

16:26.485 --> 16:28.612
<i>It was time to state my case</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:31.699
<i>to the only family I knew.</i>

16:42.501 --> 16:46.296
Black Sheep, why have you
requested our audience?

16:47.631 --> 16:48.716
I'm ready.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.718
[scoffs] To enroll?

16:51.218 --> 16:53.804
I know I'm not technically old enough,
Professor Maelstrom,

16:53.887 --> 16:57.266
but I already have what it takes
to be an awesome thief.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.642
Best ever!

16:59.685 --> 17:02.563
[stammers] Um, in-- in my opinion, sir.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.772
[Dr. Bellum] Black Sheep may be young,

17:04.314 --> 17:07.693
but she has had more training
at her age than any recruit,

17:07.776 --> 17:09.778
even if only by osmosis.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.240
Dr. Bellum is right.
Lambsie's got gumption.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.868
I'd say she's ready to run
with the big dogs.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.662
I, for one, am not thrilled
with the notion of having to endure

17:18.746 --> 17:21.081
Black Sheep's lack of manners
in a classroom setting.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.710
-The girl is feral.
-Precisely why she might be overdue

17:24.793 --> 17:28.047
for properly supervised training,
Countess Cleo.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.884
And you, Shadowsan?

17:32.801 --> 17:37.431
We are operating a vocational school,
not a nursery school.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.728
But we've never met a case
for advanced placement until now.

17:42.811 --> 17:47.566
And last time I checked,
majority vote rules.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.321
Black Sheep, you had better be certain

17:52.404 --> 17:55.365
that becoming a professional thief
is what you truly desire,

17:55.616 --> 18:01.497
for if you choose this road,
there will be no turning back.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.543
I want this more than anything,
Instructor Shadowsan.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.379
And I am willing to go
to the end of the line.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.427
[Professor Maelstrom] All in favor?

18:33.278 --> 18:36.573
[sniffles] Our little lamb's
gonna be all grown up!

18:44.039 --> 18:46.166
[Carmen] <i>I was finally</i>
<i>one of the big kids.</i>

18:47.209 --> 18:49.169
<i>One of the 40 thieves.</i>

18:49.962 --> 18:53.340
<i>I'd survived orientation,</i>
<i>and I was ready to meet</i>

18:53.423 --> 18:55.592
<i>-my future partners in crime--</i>
-[door opens]

18:55.884 --> 18:57.511
<i>my roommates.</i>

18:57.970 --> 18:59.429
Hi, I'm Black Sheep.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.474
-<i>Hola.</i> I am Antonio.
-Jean Paul. <i>Bonjour.</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:03.892
Sheena.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.521
You.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.818
Feel free to skip ahead.
I was there, too, you know.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.279
Sure, Gray. You were there.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.990
But were you seeing things
from my point of view?

19:18.949 --> 19:20.742
Uh, Black Sheep, was it?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.327
The name's Graham.

19:22.411 --> 19:26.081
Huh, this where you hide your pearls,
little girl?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.958
Please don't touch my stuff.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.252
What, these?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.963
I said keep your paws off.

19:34.798 --> 19:39.303
Uh-uh. Play nice, princess.
We all have to room together.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.639
[scoffs] Probably costume jewelry.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.811
[Carmen] <i>First day of class,</i>
<i>and I was already making friends.</i>

19:49.688 --> 19:51.356
<i>And enemies.</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:54.568
[Black Sheep] So, what's your story, Gray?

19:54.735 --> 19:58.447
I was working as a junior electrician
at the Sydney Opera House.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.407
Australia! I knew it!

20:00.490 --> 20:03.285
When one day, a light bulb went off.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.830
I could make a far better living
turning <i>out</i> the lights,

20:06.914 --> 20:09.583
stealing from the cover of darkness.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.751
Cool.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.754
What about you, kiddo? What's your story?

20:13.962 --> 20:17.716
Uh... Come on, Gray,
don't wanna be late for Stealth 101.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.846
[Shadowsan] Origami, the Japanese art
of paper folding,

20:22.930 --> 20:27.226
is the surest means
of perfecting a nimble touch.

20:28.602 --> 20:33.732
Essential for the successful
picking of pockets.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.444
[Brunt] <i>The first rule of self-defense--</i>

20:37.736 --> 20:39.988
always protect the face.

20:40.781 --> 20:45.369
Unless you wanna be knocked out cold
or wind up with a mug like mine.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.579
[both grunting]

20:51.708 --> 20:52.542
Pop quiz!

20:52.834 --> 20:56.171
One of these two vases
is discount-store-grade garbage.

20:56.505 --> 21:01.927
And the other, genuine Ming,
valued at $300,000.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.680
Which would you steal?

21:07.015 --> 21:08.183
My latest invention--

21:08.767 --> 21:10.560
the Crackle Rod.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.479
Settings can be adjusted here.

21:12.562 --> 21:16.066
-EMP, stun mode, and so on.
-[crackles]

21:19.069 --> 21:22.072
[Gunnar]
To properly execute a bait-and-switch,

21:22.322 --> 21:25.742
the objects should be
of equal weight and size.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.132
And there you have the switch.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.886
-Oh, gross! What is this?
-[chirping]

21:46.388 --> 21:50.142
That, my dear, would be the bait.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.729
[Black Sheep] Player.

21:54.604 --> 21:58.650
School's been really awesome.
I wish you were here!

21:58.734 --> 22:00.777
[Gray] Black Sheep! Come on, mate!

22:00.861 --> 22:01.820
[Player] <i>Who's that?</i>

22:01.945 --> 22:03.905
Gray, from Down Under. [chuckles]

22:04.156 --> 22:06.283
-<i>He's my best friend.</i>
-Oh.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.869
My best <i>school</i> friend.

22:08.952 --> 22:12.581
Anyway, gotta run.
I'm late for Infiltration 101.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.584
What kind of school do you go to, again?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.754
-[metal rattling]
-Stand tall, class.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.380
Today's goal--

22:20.797 --> 22:23.175
be the first to reach the target.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.185
[whirrs]

22:36.646 --> 22:37.814
[alarm blaring]

22:38.774 --> 22:40.901
[Carmen] <i>We really honed our skills.</i>

22:40.984 --> 22:43.904
<i>We studied hard and we trained hard.</i>

22:43.987 --> 22:45.280
[laughing]

22:45.363 --> 22:47.115
[screaming]

22:47.574 --> 22:49.618
[Carmen] <i>But we also played hard.</i>

22:49.951 --> 22:52.120
[Black Sheep] Here's the skinny.
Every first of December,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.706
she arrives right on schedule.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.252
I'm talking about Cookie Booker,
VILE's bookkeeper.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.588
See that thing she's holding?

23:02.297 --> 23:05.133
It's a hard drive, and it's loaded
with classified information

23:05.217 --> 23:08.929
supplied by VILE operatives
all over the world.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.474
It's way too important
to risk uploading from a remote location,

23:12.557 --> 23:17.646
so they make her do a hand-carry by boat
to avoid radar detection.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.441
Take aim, and bring the rain.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.657
[Cookie yelps]

23:30.492 --> 23:33.161
[laughter]

23:38.625 --> 23:40.377
Vlad, Boris. Hiya.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.878
[chuckles]

23:43.255 --> 23:45.340
I take full responsibility.

23:45.715 --> 23:51.012
Did I not tell you Black Sheep
was immature, impetuous?

23:51.096 --> 23:53.723
-I recommend expulsion.
-[Brunt] Uh...

23:54.683 --> 23:57.894
Isn't that... extreme?

24:00.814 --> 24:05.360
Esteemed faculty, with due respect,
Black Sheep isn't to blame.

24:05.443 --> 24:08.488
-We egged her on.
-What? No, we didn't!

24:08.989 --> 24:11.741
We can't expel
the whole herd of them, can we?

24:14.786 --> 24:18.415
Detention? What, are we in grade school?

24:18.498 --> 24:20.750
[exhales] Thanks for having my back.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.211
I'm going to have your hide.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.464
Hey, can we focus?
These code names aren't naming themselves.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.634
Ooh. I have one for you-- Shocker.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.139
-The Shocksmith?
-Lame.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.849
"Power Failure."

24:36.266 --> 24:40.145
Sorry, mates, nothing quite has
that crackle I'm looking for.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.439
[gasps] That's it!

24:43.023 --> 24:44.149
Get ready.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.068
Graham Crackle.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.612
Dude, really?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.030
We are criminals!

24:50.113 --> 24:53.200
Who would take us seriously
if we had puns for names?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.328
Okay, I'll drop the Graham part.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.913
[crackling]

24:57.996 --> 24:59.664
I'm Crackle.

-Lights out, baby!
-[rod pops]

25:05.045 --> 25:06.504
Le Chevre.

25:06.588 --> 25:10.425
Like the nimble mountain goat,
I take the high ground!

25:11.176 --> 25:13.720
[rumbles]

25:15.222 --> 25:18.767
Like the burrowing mole,
El Topo takes the low!

25:22.395 --> 25:24.189
I've earned my stripes.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.775
Call me "Tigress."

25:32.447 --> 25:34.491
So, who's off to clown college?

25:34.699 --> 25:36.326
Ugh. Him.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.203
The quiet guy from class.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.789
Hello? Code name?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.380
Ugh. He is so weird!

25:48.630 --> 25:50.674
Oh, Mime Bomb!

25:58.932 --> 26:00.934
[Carmen] <i>The school year came and went.</i>

26:01.393 --> 26:04.354

For the first exam, I call...

26:16.032 --> 26:17.409
Tigress.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.744
I got this.

26:23.581 --> 26:27.836
Somewhere in my coat
lies a single dollar bill.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.839
The coat has many pockets.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.592
Locate the target and acquire it...

26:34.801 --> 26:36.720
if you can.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.473
-You have two minutes.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.766
Mm. Money.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.979
Shadowsan is so gonna call foul.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.733
Unorthodox technique.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.071
But excellent results.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.161
No way!
Shadowsan is totally playing favorites!

27:47.582 --> 27:48.958
[Shadowsan] Black Sheep.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.936
[indistinct chattering]

28:10.605 --> 28:12.190
I swear I hit every pocket.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.275
If there was a dollar in there,
I couldn't find it.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.071
Hey, so you choked a little.
Like that's gonna affect your grade?

28:18.321 --> 28:22.867
You're the finest pickpocket in our class.
Totally in a league of your own.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.411
You think?

28:24.828 --> 28:26.413
I <i>know.</i>

28:30.166 --> 28:32.460
[all cheering]

28:32.544 --> 28:33.545
[El Topo] I don't believe it!

28:33.628 --> 28:34.963
Results are in!

28:38.967 --> 28:40.760
Yes! [whoops]

28:44.055 --> 28:47.559
<i>-Félicitations, mon ami!</i>
-Upward and onward, <i>mi amigo!</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:55.900
Gray?

28:56.609 --> 28:57.944
[stammers] Did-- did you...?

28:58.236 --> 28:59.487
I'm good, but...

29:07.495 --> 29:08.955
I'm really sorry.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.248
Crackle.

29:10.665 --> 29:13.042
Come sit at the big kids' table.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.044
[Black Sheep] Go on, Gray.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.838
I'll be fine.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.134
Aw. Looks like someone needs
to turn in their stealth suit.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.636
Come on, let's go plot a caper.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.856
[keys jingling]

29:34.939 --> 29:36.608
Looking for these?

29:38.568 --> 29:40.487
Playing games? Typical.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.405
No game. I want a do-over.

29:42.489 --> 29:47.035
And you will have it next year,
once you redo your coursework.

29:47.243 --> 29:51.664
You're not hearing me.
Put on the coat. I want a do-over <i>now.</i>

29:51.831 --> 29:56.795
We do not bend policy for other students,
so we really must stop doing it for you.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.339
Good night, Black Sheep.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.050
The coat was empty, wasn't it?

30:02.759 --> 30:06.137
Are you accusing
a VILE instructor of cheating?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.680
[stammers] S-Sorry.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.226
It's just I know I'm as good
as anyone in my class.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.270
Better, even.
And I know you know it, too!

30:14.437 --> 30:19.317
And you also happen to be unruly,
undisciplined, and a prankster!

30:20.026 --> 30:24.656
I would strongly urge that you find a way
to get those qualities in check

30:24.739 --> 30:28.451
since they seem to be holding you back.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.791
No. Nothing's holding me back.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.334
Not anymore.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.850
[helicopter blades whirring]

30:56.020 --> 30:57.021
[groans]

30:57.105 --> 30:58.523
[gate clanging]

31:08.324 --> 31:11.536
[Gray] Our first crime caper,
where it all gets real!

31:13.204 --> 31:14.581
School's out, boys.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.374
Time to strut our stuff.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.709
[engine revving]

31:23.631 --> 31:25.133
[Gray] Bye-bye, Black Sheep.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.099
[theme music playing]
