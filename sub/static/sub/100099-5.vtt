WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.351
Previously onSupergirl...

00:06.310 --> 00:07.442
It was me.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.400
I erased him from our minds.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.837
I as good as murdered
my own brother.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.538
This is not the Phantom Zone.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.192
Don't think of this
as a prison.
I'm not your enemy.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.020
In fact, I think
we can help each other.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.847
This is an Aurafacian.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.372
This is an alien organism
that attaches to a host body.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.679
All right.
Let's get these down
into holding.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.942
I'm here undercover
to investigate Andrea Rojas.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.988
Two years' worth of reporting

00:32.031 --> 00:34.512
that suggests
a criminal conspiracy
bigger than Al Capone.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.993
I'd never forgive myself
if you got wrapped up in this.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.082
Leviathan is coming.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.261
Imagine you,
anytime of the day,

00:44.305 --> 00:46.176
anywhere in the world,

00:46.220 --> 00:47.830
with all your friends.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.050
Then imagine

00:50.093 --> 00:52.704
that all of you can do
anything that comes to mind.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.665
Well, you don't have to
imagine anymore.

01:06.936 --> 01:10.287
Obsidian North's
"Collective Dream" VR lenses

01:10.331 --> 01:12.072
are now worldwide.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.551
So why are you waiting?

01:19.731 --> 01:23.431
Make your imagination
your reality today.

01:35.878 --> 01:36.748
Brilliant!

01:38.359 --> 01:41.144
Thank you, William.
I'm proud of it.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.407
Which is why I want
every department

01:43.451 --> 01:45.061
to be writing about the launch

01:45.105 --> 01:47.150
right up until it happens
on Friday.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.892
Business, entertainment,
sports, politics,

01:49.935 --> 01:53.330
work it into your stories
as if our financial well-being

01:53.374 --> 01:54.549
depended on it.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.116
Because it does.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.900
-Gross.
-Double gross.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.293
And one more thing.

01:59.336 --> 02:02.078
One of you needs to start
giving continual updates

02:02.122 --> 02:03.340
on our growing sales.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.168
We need to pump this up.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.344
-I'm your man.
-Great.

02:07.388 --> 02:08.997
Now let's get to it.

02:10.651 --> 02:12.784
It's bad enough
that we have to do
journalism-via-tweet.

02:12.828 --> 02:15.004
Now she wants to
turn us into ad hacks?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.397
Speaking of hacks...

02:17.615 --> 02:19.704
Joe Pulitzer is certainly
all for it.

02:19.748 --> 02:20.966
Uh-huh.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.186
I was so sure you were
gonna find something

02:23.230 --> 02:25.797
at that address
listed in his name.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.625
First he is linked
to the death of Dr. Jarrod,

02:27.669 --> 02:31.063
then to
whatever "covert action"
happened in Mexico City.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.414
I don't know,
I find it hard it to believe
there's no connection.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.459
I know. I guess we were
looking for connections

02:35.503 --> 02:37.331
where there weren't any.

02:37.374 --> 02:40.247
I mean, he was just
in the wrong place

02:40.290 --> 02:41.900
at the wrong time
with Dr. Jarrod,

02:41.944 --> 02:45.774
and then Mexico City
was just about
the Miss Mexico pageant.

02:45.817 --> 02:48.429
William Dey's not a murderer.
He's just a grade-A jerk.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.922
-Kara. Hi.
-Kelly, hey.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.098
-You're just who I needed.
-Is everything okay?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.665
Yeah, it's good. I just...

03:07.709 --> 03:09.841
I want to get Alex a gift
for our date-aversary,

03:09.885 --> 03:11.539
and I could
really use your help--

03:11.582 --> 03:14.237
A Schadel XG-1000
motorcycle helmet,

03:14.281 --> 03:15.891
in small, matte black.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.414
Oh. That is very specific.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.938
-So is Alex's Pinterest page.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.636
You know, meeting Alex

03:21.679 --> 03:23.551
is one of the best things
that has happened to me

03:23.594 --> 03:26.075
since moving to National City.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.598
But having you
in the picture...

03:27.642 --> 03:30.253
-That's been
a pretty cool bonus.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.256
Believe me,
the feeling is mutual.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.345
But you know what?
I, uh...

03:35.389 --> 03:37.391
I promised all these
reporters upstairs
a round of coffee.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.350
-And if I don't get it,
there will be a riot.
- Okay.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.483
Uh, remember,
small matte black.

03:42.526 --> 03:43.832
Got it.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.314
What's the deal?

03:47.357 --> 03:49.403
I've been texting you
all morning.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.492
Phones can be hacked.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.233
Call me overly cautious,
but I'm trying to expose

03:53.276 --> 03:55.670
one of the world's
most powerful families
as criminals.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.281
That's why I was texting you.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.503
Morning.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.681
I figured out a way I can help.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.335
Kara...

04:09.336 --> 04:10.859
Just...

04:11.860 --> 04:13.296
Hear me out. Okay?

04:13.340 --> 04:16.125
From what you've explained,
you have all this evidence

04:16.168 --> 04:19.781
suggesting the Rojases
are masters
of corporate espionage,

04:20.476 --> 04:22.392
and have a team of operatives

04:22.436 --> 04:24.133
and assassins
at their beck and call.

04:24.176 --> 04:27.397
But nothing connecting them
directly to the crimes. Right?

04:27.441 --> 04:29.269
Yes, it's a
frustrating failure.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.923
Well, what if I told you

04:31.967 --> 04:35.362
that my sister works
for a small g...

04:35.405 --> 04:37.538
Government agency.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.279
And they just arrested someone

04:39.322 --> 04:41.411
who they think
targeted Elena Torres
in Mexico City yesterday.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.152
Kara, don't tell me
you told your sister
about this.

04:43.195 --> 04:46.198
I-I didn't tell her details,
but now we have a lead.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.461
What's the catch?

04:47.504 --> 04:49.506
Two conditions. One...

04:49.550 --> 04:53.728
You have to sign an NDA
saying you will never tell
anyone where she works.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.991
And, two...

04:56.034 --> 04:58.428
Kara, I told you
you don't want
any part of this story.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.822
I am not in it for the story.

05:00.865 --> 05:01.823
When...

05:03.259 --> 05:04.826
When Andrea come to CatCo,

05:04.869 --> 05:07.132
I thought she was
just a bad boss
and a hack journalist.

05:07.176 --> 05:11.049
But if she really is
actually involved
in a web of murders,

05:11.093 --> 05:13.356
I can't walk away from that.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.358
I am in it for the justice.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.447
You've been going at this solo
for so long.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
I could be useful.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.321
What's the harm
in letting me help?

05:21.364 --> 05:24.585
The harm is that
you could get hurt.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.370
-I'm not
just talking physically.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.459
This has cost me
friends, family.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.375
It's an obsession
that's taken up
two years of my life.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.072
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.987
You don't have to
worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

05:36.031 --> 05:36.988
Plus,

05:38.381 --> 05:40.905
if you don't bring me
the offer's off the table.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.302
-Okay.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.173
You win. Let's go.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.044
Ha!

05:51.002 --> 05:54.702
Test subject 0505.
Trial commencement.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.400
Image induce
to human-form 2257.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.402
Now.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.928
Subject induced.

06:07.628 --> 06:08.890
Prep for tracking.

06:13.938 --> 06:17.246
Q-wave sensors locked and ready
to probe occipital lobe.

06:17.289 --> 06:20.641
Ms. Luthor, you realize
if this goes as planned,

06:20.684 --> 06:22.469
we are about to discover
how to do

06:22.512 --> 06:25.950
what it is that doctors,
politicians, even priests
have failed to do.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.257
Rendering people incapable
of hurting each other.

06:29.563 --> 06:30.607
Activate.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.794
You cannot touch me.

06:51.889 --> 06:55.153
Mr. Dey, if half
your suspicions about
the Rojases are true,

06:55.197 --> 06:57.895
then this presents
a huge security risk.

06:57.939 --> 07:01.377
Still, you are here
as observers

07:01.421 --> 07:02.639
so follow my lead.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.380
-Of course.
-Let him in.

07:07.731 --> 07:08.993
Thank you for doing this.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.082
Yeah, well, Obsidian Worldwide
is a big deal.

07:11.126 --> 07:14.390
Plus, working at Obsidian
is Kelly's dream job,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.566
so before I have the DEO
make any moves on her boss,

07:16.610 --> 07:19.395
I need to be certain
that she is guilty.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.918
Right, yes. Speaking of, uh,

07:20.962 --> 07:24.748
Kelly asked me what to get you
for your date-aversary.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.663
She doesn't need to get me--

07:26.707 --> 07:29.623
I told her the Schadel
XG-1000 motorcycle helmet
in small, matte black.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.277
God, I love you.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.541
Is this
some sort of torture device?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.500
It's a Truth Seeker.

07:37.544 --> 07:41.199
It makes it so that those
who are inclined to lie, can't.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.419
For example,

07:43.463 --> 07:46.422
did Andrea Rojas hire you
to target Elena Torres?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.425
I don't ask who hires me.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.037
My jobs come over
an encrypted server
that compensates me in Bitcoin.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.562
Okay. Have you
ever met Andrea Rojas

07:55.605 --> 07:57.520
or any member
of the Rojas family

07:57.564 --> 07:58.826
or anyone that
they are affiliated with?

07:58.869 --> 08:02.133
I only meet
the other contractors.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.920
There was this lady
with killer tattoos,

08:05.963 --> 08:08.792
a guy who could detach
most of his fingers,

08:08.836 --> 08:12.448
and this big dude
with some extra appendages.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.189
-How many--
-How many...

08:15.495 --> 08:16.626
...appendages?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.628
He had four arms.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.413
Like this?

08:22.589 --> 08:24.286
Yeah, that's him.

08:24.329 --> 08:25.592
His code name is Rip Roar.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.507
-When did you last see him?
-William.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.900
-Two years ago
on a job in Darien...
-No time after?

08:29.944 --> 08:31.162
- No.
-Mr. Dey...

08:31.206 --> 08:32.729
So where is he based?
Who are his target?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.514
You have to know something.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.080
I have literally
told you everything.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.081
That's a bloody lie!

08:37.125 --> 08:38.648
-That will be enough!
-William.

08:38.692 --> 08:39.909
Out!

08:41.650 --> 08:43.044
What was that about?

08:43.087 --> 08:46.351
-You have to tell me.
-He murdered my best friend.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.266
What?

08:48.310 --> 08:51.792
My mate from college.
Russell Rogers.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.750
Two years ago,
he got suspicious
of the Rojases,

08:53.794 --> 08:57.362
and the next day,
that monster killed him.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.539
-Never found the body.
-Then how do you know
he's dead?

08:59.582 --> 09:02.803
These are professional killers.
They don't leave evidence.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.326
I have a friend
that could help with this.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.110
I should have
never told you any of this.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.460
Now look how involved you are.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.856
It's why I told you
to stay away.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.208
It's an emotional abyss.

09:28.742 --> 09:31.048
Hold it. Set the case down.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.790
Turn around.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.577
Show me your hands.

09:54.419 --> 09:55.682
Russell Rogers.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.294
I'll look into
his disappearance.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.861
Thank you.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.645
And how are you feeling?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.429
With everything
that happened with Mal...

10:04.473 --> 10:07.215
Well,
I'm still processing it all.

10:07.258 --> 10:10.697
But it gave me deeper knowledge
about myself and...

10:10.740 --> 10:11.872
And my people.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.787
I can learn from that.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.702
How about you? Are you okay?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.921
You've been through a lot.

10:17.965 --> 10:21.142
The reporter you hated
turns out to be a good guy

10:21.185 --> 10:23.448
and Andrea Rojas is potentially
involved in murders.

10:23.492 --> 10:26.234
Yeah, I can't talk about this
with anyone but you and Alex.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.453
I swore to William
I'd keep it secret.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.672
Even from Nia.

10:29.716 --> 10:33.067
But honestly,
I... I'm, I'm reeling.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.852
I never would have thought
Andrea was a criminal

10:35.896 --> 10:39.029
and I was convinced
William was evil.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.901
How could I have been
so wrong about both of them?

10:40.944 --> 10:42.859
And now,
with Obsidian tech everywhere,

10:42.903 --> 10:44.687
I mean, everyone's
just in these

10:45.732 --> 10:47.777
make-believe worlds and...

10:47.821 --> 10:49.736
It's hard to know
what's real anymore.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.695
I just want some certainty.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.915
You know, my biggest takeaway

10:54.958 --> 10:56.133
from what happened
with Malefic,

10:56.177 --> 10:59.136
is when the world is uncertain,

10:59.180 --> 11:01.704
there's one thing
that's rock solid.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.880
It's the people
who love you.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.580
Alex needs me at the DEO.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.804
We had a break-in
at Fort Summit.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.893
Please don't tell me
it is Lex's vault.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.766
Indeed.
And this is the assailant.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.681
It is the same guy
William talked about.

11:21.724 --> 11:22.899
What did he steal?

11:22.943 --> 11:26.076
Mr. Luthor called it
his Marathon Laser.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.731
It's able to launch
a concentrated beam of heat

11:28.775 --> 11:31.603
at a target
up to 26.2 miles away.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.909
It's an assassin's dream.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.737
Is there any way
we can track it?

11:34.781 --> 11:36.217
We are scanning for the weapon.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.915
With any luck, that will
lead us to the man as well.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.569
William said Rip Roar was

11:40.612 --> 11:43.137
a part of the Rojases's
team of operatives.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.879
Now they're stealing
one of Lex's weapons

11:45.922 --> 11:49.012
the day before the launch
of Andrea's lenses?

11:49.056 --> 11:50.884
If William Dey is right
about Andrea Rojas,

11:50.927 --> 11:53.103
there's a high probability
of a connection.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.627
But Kelly did say
the VR launch is virtual.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.934
So people aren't gonna be
gathering in one place.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.066
So what use
is that weapon then?

11:59.109 --> 12:00.981
We've gotta be
missing something.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.460
I'll take another run
at Breathtaker.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.766
No, we tried that.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.725
Even with the Truth Seeker,
she's got nothing.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.292
I might have a solution.

12:08.336 --> 12:12.470
There is always
the other assassin we caught.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.776
What, O'Connor?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.125
-She's dead.
-Yes.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.867
But her tattoos are alive
and sentient.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.695
Wouldn't we need a host?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.305
We would, yes.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.700
Approaching me
while I'm still conscious.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.790
How thoughtful of you.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.140
It seems
we have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.622
So I have a proposition.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.407
You have the ability
to incept thoughts
into people's minds.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.845
I want to study your brain,
so I can develop a technology

12:38.888 --> 12:40.542
that can do the same thing.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.762
Forgive my skepticism,

12:42.805 --> 12:46.591
but last time
someone showed interest
in my brain,

12:46.635 --> 12:48.550
the High Council sent me
to the Phantom Zone.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.944
You'd be
back in the Phantom Zone
if it wasn't for me.

12:50.987 --> 12:54.077
And yet, now we are
at an impasse.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.084
What's in it for me?

13:01.128 --> 13:02.869
We both want the same thing.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.655
We were each betrayed
by the people closest to us.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.006
Work with me.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.008
I believe you've the ability
to do great things.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.011
I don't want
to do great things.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.057
I want revenge.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.842
So I have a proposal for you.

13:19.886 --> 13:23.933
Martian biology prevents
a brother from
harming his brother.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.980
That's why I've been
attacking the people
closest to J'onn J'onzz.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.896
If you remove
this barrier from my brain

13:29.939 --> 13:32.115
so I can kill my brother,

13:32.159 --> 13:34.204
I will give you access
to my mind.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.380
It is my mission to stop people
from hurting each other.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.468
I will not kill.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.383
Perhaps.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.822
But you've gone
to extreme measures
to bring me here.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.825
And now,
you are at the precipice.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.219
Studying my mind is the key.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.441
I know of desperation, human.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.098
I know the depths you feel.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.622
I would have to develop
the technology first.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.845
Your terms are acceptable.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.935
Let's begin.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.807
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.331
Once we say "the phrase,"

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
you're gonna augment
the executive section
of your brain

14:16.812 --> 14:19.510
to allow the Aurafacian
to speak through you.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.556
Yes.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.906
And thanks to
my polygraph filter,

14:23.950 --> 14:25.560
it won't be able to lie.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.824
That is the phrase.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.695
I've kept it top secret
all day.

14:30.739 --> 14:31.696
You're welcome.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.089
Seriously?

14:33.133 --> 14:36.614
It's from the oeuvre
of Mr. Keanu Reeves.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.790
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

14:43.839 --> 14:45.145
Brainy?

14:49.149 --> 14:51.978
Release me, human!

14:52.021 --> 14:54.023
You know that
we're not going to do that.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.198
We want information.

14:55.242 --> 14:58.158
Come near, I'll give it to you.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.074
You worked with
a contractor named Rip Roar.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.814
He has a very dangerous weapon.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.338
How do we find him?

15:04.381 --> 15:08.951
Perhaps put an ad in the paper
for a four-armed freak.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.216
There's a chance he might
use this weapon tomorrow.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.871
Do you have any idea
who the target might be?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.526
I never know who's behind it.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.224
All I know

15:21.268 --> 15:26.316
is that someone is spending
a great deal of capital...

15:27.404 --> 15:31.974
...to do
a great deal of damage.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.497
You've committed
dozens of murders

15:33.541 --> 15:36.065
but don't have
the slightest idea
who's responsible?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.458
I don't care to know.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.982
You don't care about
all those people you killed?

15:40.026 --> 15:42.245
Their family, their friends,

15:42.289 --> 15:45.118
all those lives
you've destroyed?

15:45.161 --> 15:46.684
-You have to know something!
-I don't know.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.686
-No, you know something
and we're--
- Hey!

15:48.730 --> 15:50.558
Hey, it's Brainy.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.038
Kryptonia.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.129
Come here! Let me
print myself on your skin!

15:56.172 --> 15:57.739
Pop quiz, hotshot!

16:01.612 --> 16:03.745
Uh, did it work?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.097
-Hey.
-I know. I know. I'm sorry.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.752
-I overreacted.
-No. You're right.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.623
This is getting way bigger
than we thought.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.018
I'm gonna confront Andrea.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.889
Okay, slow down.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.239
We need to be strategic.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.023
Okay? We need to see
the bigger plan here.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.070
Plus, there is still a chance
that she's not even involved.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.593
What makes you say that?

16:25.636 --> 16:27.725
Kelly believes in Andrea,
and the work that she's doing.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.249
It helps people.

16:29.292 --> 16:32.252
And Andrea's never even been
accused of anything illegal.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.254
Even according to Will,
Elena Torres offered

16:34.297 --> 16:36.647
only circumstantial evidence
against her.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.649
Look, Kelly has been
through the ringer.

16:38.693 --> 16:42.044
And I really don't want to
pull the rug out from under her
unless I have to.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.089
Trust me,

16:43.132 --> 16:44.177
I want answers too,

16:44.220 --> 16:46.005
but these are big accusations

16:46.048 --> 16:47.310
and we need to be certain.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.138
I know everything you're saying
makes sense,

16:49.182 --> 16:50.270
but I have this gut feeling

16:50.313 --> 16:52.707
that Andrea's
up to something big.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.796
Lex Luthor had a plan
for world domination

16:54.839 --> 16:55.927
that felt a lot like this.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.234
And that time,
I was almost too late.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.410
I cannot let that happen again.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.238
We won't.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.935
If Andrea's involved,
we'll figure out how.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.113
I have an idea.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.376
Supergirl.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.031
I trust your gut, too.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.005
I have the Marathon Laser.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.529
What do you want me
to do with it?

17:34.314 --> 17:36.925
Do what
Lex Luthor failed to do.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.407
Change the world.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.505
Big day tomorrow, William.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.074
Five million subscribers big.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.379
And counting.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.207
Now that's the news
I wanna hear.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.218
-Careful now.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.612
That's my brain
you're about to play with.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.005
The occipital lobe is where
the Q-waves are generated.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.140
Q-waves are projected
like sonar from a dolphin.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.621
But your waves
are a very special frequency

18:20.664 --> 18:22.449
that allows you
this unique ability

18:22.492 --> 18:25.147
to control the thoughts
and emotions of others.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
This is the frequency
we want to isolate.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.500
That "unique ability"

18:30.544 --> 18:32.981
has been my cross to bear
my whole life.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.157
To think

18:35.201 --> 18:38.204
it comes down to something
as simple as a frequency...

18:38.247 --> 18:40.815
All you have to do
is incept
these three test subjects.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.252
All right?
There's a Daxamite Scorpion,

18:43.296 --> 18:44.297
a Terran Oceanic Devil,

18:44.340 --> 18:46.081
and a Maladorian Dendroasp.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.910
As you project
your waves at them,

18:48.953 --> 18:50.390
we'll measure the frequency,

18:50.433 --> 18:52.348
fine-tuning as we go,
'til we hit the magic number.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.655
So, are we ready?

18:54.698 --> 18:58.049
As long as killing J'onn J'onzz
is the final result,

18:58.093 --> 19:00.617
"we" can't wait.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.054
I really appreciate
you bringing food.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.839
It's exactly what I needed.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.363
It's gonna be
another very late night, so...

19:07.407 --> 19:08.756
Oh, no. What happened?

19:08.799 --> 19:12.325
Oh. You know,
just another day at the DEO.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.153
A stolen Luthor weapon

19:14.196 --> 19:17.286
and a conspiracy
of meta-assassins.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.333
Well, I am here for you

19:20.376 --> 19:22.335
if you ever need to
talk about anything.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.379
Of course.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.641
How are you?

19:25.425 --> 19:26.426
Well,

19:26.469 --> 19:30.299
Obsidian is abuzz
with the launch,

19:30.343 --> 19:32.954
and I had my first
patient success story.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.391
Yeah. He was having nightmares
for over a year.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.264
And with VR therapy,
they stopped.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.657
That's amazing.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.137
Oh. And...

19:42.181 --> 19:44.618
I made a surprise reservation
for our date-aversary.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.924
-At the waterfront.
-Really?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.099
-That's nice.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.840
But don't you
have to be on deck

19:49.884 --> 19:51.538
for the Obsidian launch?

19:51.581 --> 19:53.583
Well, since it's virtual,
I can bring
the lenses to dinner,

19:53.627 --> 19:56.412
and then we can join millions
in virtual celebration.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.371
Okay, now that sounds like

19:58.414 --> 20:00.503
one of your boss's
freaky advertisements.

20:00.547 --> 20:04.246
Just because it's freaky,
doesn't mean it's not awesome.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.117
-Well, cheers to that.
-Ah.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.338
Okay.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.518
-William.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.651
I'm looking for clues
to what Andrea's been up to.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.436
Well, I am, too.
But if Andrea sees you in here,
she'll kill you.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.438
-And that's not a metaphor.
-It's fine.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.092
I... I looped the cameras.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.268
I borrowed something
from the DEO.
What are you doing here?

20:26.312 --> 20:27.661
What I should've done
in the first place,

20:27.704 --> 20:29.402
gone straight to the source.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.100
Now, thanks to my friends
at MI-8, I can.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.275
But, well,
you should know first

20:33.319 --> 20:35.190
the DEO got a lead
on Rip Roar.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.454
Where? How?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.326
From what I understand,

20:40.369 --> 20:42.458
he's stolen
a pretty powerful weapon.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.330
And they're afraid
he's gonna use it

20:44.373 --> 20:46.593
in connection
with Andrea's launch.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.290
That means we have
less than a day

20:48.334 --> 20:49.944
to figure out
what she's planning.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.468
- You really think

20:52.512 --> 20:54.557
Andrea would leave
information on her laptop?

20:54.601 --> 20:55.906
I mean,
she's kind of tech savant.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.386
Oh, there's got to be
something in here.

20:57.430 --> 21:00.302
If there is,
don't you think it'd be like,

21:00.346 --> 21:02.435
in a nook or cranny

21:02.478 --> 21:04.567
or under the floor
or something.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.700
You look your way,
I'll look mine.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.271
-Of course
she has a Firewall.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.581
"Access denied?"

21:22.455 --> 21:24.370
I think I hit pay dirt.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.895
How did you know
to look in there?

21:27.938 --> 21:29.026
Lucky guess.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.681
But look what
she has stashed in here.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.684
Foreign currency,
I mean, that's pretty shady.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.426
Uh, some sort of chain and...

21:39.559 --> 21:41.212
Hello.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.475
Isn't that Russell?

21:42.518 --> 21:43.737
Did they know each other?

21:46.566 --> 21:48.698
They more than just
"knew each other."

21:48.742 --> 21:50.613
At least according to Russell

21:50.657 --> 21:52.093
the last time I saw him.

21:54.443 --> 21:57.316
-Wow.
-I'm crazy about her.
I think she's the one.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.319
Man, you are sunk.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.103
Well, almost.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.584
-What do you mean?
-She comes from
a powerful family.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.803
You know, there's a lot
going on there.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.805
And they make a point
about shutting me out.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.546
-What? They don't think
you are good enough?
-Nah.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.852
It's not that.

22:11.895 --> 22:16.247
It's more like
they got secrets.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.640
What, like dead bodies?

22:19.381 --> 22:21.992
Oi, you're not getting
into something dodgy, are you?

22:22.036 --> 22:23.342
Nothing I can't handle.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.995
This doesn't sound good, Russ.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.389
I just don't know
how deep these things go
with these people.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.609
But Andrea
is nothing like her family.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.393
I'll sort it out
with her tonight.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.221
Then tomorrow,

22:33.264 --> 22:36.224
I can figure out a time
when she can finally meet
my best friend.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.008
What, you haven't mentioned me?

22:38.052 --> 22:39.662
If you think I'd let her
anywhere near
that wicked smile of yours

22:39.706 --> 22:42.099
before we're settled,
you're madder than I thought.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.666
-Ah.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.625
That was the last
I saw of him.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.628
Russell?

22:48.671 --> 22:50.281
You need a new lock, mate.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.424
Stop!

23:02.468 --> 23:04.208
-Where's Russell?
-Dead.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.484
Oh, my God, William.
That's horrible.

23:19.528 --> 23:20.964
Let's get out of here.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.930
Well,
I reset the cameras.

23:29.973 --> 23:32.628
No one will know
we were in Andrea's office.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.413
She has to be involved in this.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.066
Rip Roar, Russell.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.547
Do you remember
how she reacted
when it happened?

23:38.591 --> 23:39.853
She is a billionaire heiress.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.637
I didn't have access to her.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.552
The police
couldn't find anything,

23:43.596 --> 23:45.598
so they just presumed
he skipped town.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.861
-There's no body, no leads.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.166
So I tried to find some leads

23:49.210 --> 23:51.517
by researching Andrea
and her family.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.649
I know I'm on
the right track here,

23:53.693 --> 23:55.477
just haven't
been able to prove it.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.697
And now,
with Russ's killer back,

23:57.740 --> 24:00.003
maybe it's time
I just ask her point blank.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.657
William, don't even
joke about that.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.920
We... We have to be certain
of what we're up against first.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.053
Now is not the time
to be rash.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.358
Look who's talking.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.665
You broke into Andrea's office
before I did.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.929
That's true.
But you've...

24:12.973 --> 24:16.019
You've dedicated
so much of your life
to this already.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.240
What's the risk in hanging on
just for a little bit longer?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.633
Is that what you told yourself

24:20.676 --> 24:21.895
when you were chasing
the Lex Luthor story?

24:21.938 --> 24:24.593
To slow down
and "hang on?"

24:24.637 --> 24:26.073
Actually, yeah, it was.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.163
And it was really hard.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.645
But I did it because
I could feel that I was close.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.604
Just like I can feel
we are so close right now.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.913
That's, uh...
Sorry, it's my sister.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.481
Alex, what's up?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.700
Brainy tracked the signature
of the Marathon Laser

24:44.744 --> 24:46.876
to the Socorro
Satellite Station
in New Mexico.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.530
We need Supergirl there now.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.227
I'm on my way.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.449
Something came up
with my family.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.583
But just promise me
you're not gonna do anything.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.424
Rip Roar.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.993
I know who you are.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.213
And I know
you killed Russell Rogers.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.649
You know nothing.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.172
And you're out of your depth.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.012
Alex.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.885
I need J'onn.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.200
Thank you
for helping me.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.158
I'm feeling a lot better.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.594
You know
I'm always here for you.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.204
Hey, look, I tracked down

25:54.248 --> 25:56.467
the apartment where
Russell Rogers lived in London.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.731
I did a psychic sweep.

25:58.774 --> 26:01.472
I did see evidence of a struggle there years ago,

26:01.516 --> 26:02.691
but nothing else.

26:02.735 --> 26:03.910
You mean he's still alive?

26:03.953 --> 26:06.042
Possibly. I'm still looking.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.961
Where are we on Rip Roar
and what did he hit me with?

26:12.005 --> 26:13.833
It's called
a Fusion Cannon.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.835
Or at least it is
100 years from now.

26:15.878 --> 26:18.881
It's the result
of the ingenious combination
of Lex's Marathon Laser

26:18.925 --> 26:20.883
plus a particle amplifier.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.845
That's what Rip Roar stole
from the satellite base.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.456
Yes, the combined technologies
create an energy beam

26:28.499 --> 26:31.067
100 times hotter
than the center of the sun.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.852
If it's capable
of damage like that,

26:32.895 --> 26:34.462
imagine what else it can do.

26:34.505 --> 26:35.463
We need to find it.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.291
Uh, yes, about that...

26:37.334 --> 26:40.120
The amplifier's radiation
obfuscates the cannon's
energy signature,

26:40.163 --> 26:42.731
which makes tracking it
quite difficult.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.951
Well, Obsidian North's launch
is today.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.648
So whatever
Andrea's been up to,

26:46.692 --> 26:48.694
will probably come to a head.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.218
Brainy, is there anything
about the launch
we might have missed?

26:52.001 --> 26:53.133
Negative.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.223
Gotta be connected.

26:56.963 --> 27:02.011
Andrea, Rip Roar, the weapon.

27:02.055 --> 27:05.493
And we've got to find out how
before he hurts anyone else.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.712
He's got to be stopped.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.853
Alex, hi, it's me.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.463
Look, I know you're busy,

27:19.507 --> 27:21.291
so I will text you the address
for the restaurant tonight.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.903
And if you're running late,
don't worry.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.600
Just get there when you can.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.254
And we'll start to relax.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.778
Okay, people.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.693
The Collective Dream launch
is in less than an hour.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.564
William, what is
our user count?

27:38.613 --> 27:40.354
We'll have nine million.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.182
That's more than
the population of most
of the world's countries.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.357
Well done.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.753
And now,
our final test subject,

27:47.796 --> 27:49.668
the Maladorian Dendroasp.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.974
It is 100 times
more aggressive than
anything on Earth.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.760
I want you to do to it
what you did to them.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.718
Sensors are ready
and calibrated.

27:57.937 --> 27:58.807
Now.

28:27.618 --> 28:28.968
Satisfied?

28:30.186 --> 28:31.448
It worked.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.583
Lake Vostok.

28:35.626 --> 28:36.932
Okay, in English, Brainy.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.934
Actually, it's in Antarctica,

28:38.978 --> 28:40.631
where I believe
Rip Roar is heading.

28:40.675 --> 28:41.850
Antarctica?

28:42.721 --> 28:43.765
After cross-referencing

28:43.809 --> 28:45.636
information gleaned
from Breathtaker

28:45.680 --> 28:47.203
and the Aurafacian,

28:47.247 --> 28:49.466
I have discovered
that each of
the three Rojas assassins

28:49.510 --> 28:51.077
all targeted an employee

28:51.120 --> 28:53.688
of the Lake Vostok
Antarctica Base,

28:53.732 --> 28:55.037
all within the last month.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.779
A scientist, an engineer
and a security officer?

28:57.823 --> 28:59.302
What's the significance?

28:59.346 --> 29:01.565
Well, given what
each of the targeted
individuals knew,

29:01.609 --> 29:04.830
it is possible that
every single security protocol
on that base

29:04.873 --> 29:05.787
can now be overridden.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.310
I still don't get it.

29:07.354 --> 29:10.139
Lake Vostok is the largest
subglacial lake in the world.

29:10.183 --> 29:13.403
Now, I'm no super-villain,

29:14.013 --> 29:15.101
but if I were,

29:15.144 --> 29:17.320
and I was right over
an Antarctic lake

29:17.364 --> 29:21.803
with a weapon designed
to fire a beam 100 times hotter
than the center of the sun,

29:21.847 --> 29:23.936
well, it would be, as they say,

29:23.979 --> 29:26.155
"a hot time in
the old town tonight."

29:29.071 --> 29:30.507
Not that that's a good thing.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.901
So you're saying that
he's going to melt the ice cap

29:32.945 --> 29:34.511
around Lake Vostok?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.209
If he did that,

29:36.252 --> 29:39.821
it would unleash a flood
unseen since the time
of Noah's Ark.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.100
This one's still alive.

30:06.369 --> 30:07.849
Rip Roar, no!

30:19.339 --> 30:20.644
Status?

30:20.688 --> 30:22.081
A massive eruption
in the Antarctic water table

30:22.124 --> 30:23.560
has sent shock waves
east and west,

30:23.604 --> 30:26.172
resulting in an unprecedented
number of sea swells.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.913
Based on the seafloor pattern

30:27.956 --> 30:30.045
and the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current,

30:30.089 --> 30:31.177
the biggest is set
to make landfall

30:31.220 --> 30:33.005
on the Pacific coast
in under an hour.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.267
Which part
of the Pacific coast?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.183
All of it.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.018
Leaving so soon?

30:52.589 --> 30:53.634
Smart move.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.595
What have you done?

30:58.639 --> 30:59.945
I do what they tell me to.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.816
They? Who is "they?"

31:01.860 --> 31:02.991
I don't know.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.907
Supergirl,
can you hear me?

31:05.951 --> 31:07.343
Alex, we have Rip Roar,

31:07.387 --> 31:09.084
but he punched a hole
in the lake.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.913
We know. The eruption
just sent a tidal wave our way.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.088
We can deal
with the swell, Supergirl.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.308
You and J'onn
need to seal that geyser,

31:15.351 --> 31:18.050
or else we'll have
bigger problems than a wave.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.921
What do you mean?

31:19.965 --> 31:23.098
That geyser is pumping out
three cubic miles of water
every second.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.187
At that rate,
every coastal city in the world

31:25.231 --> 31:27.189
will start flooding
in 12 minutes.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.235
The loss of life
could be in the billions.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.979
So how do we stop that wave?

31:34.805 --> 31:35.850
Dreamer.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.982
It's too late.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.375
Once it's started
it can't be stopped.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.376
Trust me,

31:40.986 --> 31:42.378
I can stop this.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.120
Thank you.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.093
Welcome one and all
to the most amazing party

32:01.136 --> 32:02.833
you'll ever attend.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.270
Welcome,

32:04.313 --> 32:07.012
welcome to The Communal Dream.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.845
Welcome,

32:14.889 --> 32:16.021
welcome, everyone.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.071
We'll have to
invert the flow of water.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.333
The geyser's pushing it up.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.683
Maybe a whirlpool
could pull it down.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.381
We'll fly around the base.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.166
But we need to do it
in perfect formation.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.646
With this amount of water,

32:32.689 --> 32:35.257
the suction could
pull you under
and suffocate you.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.216
Well then, we'd better
keep our cool.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.180
Why aren't you at the launch?

32:45.224 --> 32:47.052
Did you find something
more important?

32:47.095 --> 32:49.271
Actually...

32:50.229 --> 32:51.839
I did find something.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.711
His name is Russell Rogers.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.278
What?

32:57.323 --> 32:59.107
I saw the photo, Andrea.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.067
I know all about
the two of you.

33:03.285 --> 33:06.071
What did you do with him?

33:06.114 --> 33:07.898
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.248
I know about O'Connor

33:09.291 --> 33:11.946
and Breathtaker and Rip Roar.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.469
I know about you
and your family,

33:13.513 --> 33:16.255
and everything
you've gotten away with.

33:16.298 --> 33:19.649
Corruption, theft, murder.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.217
But you're not going to
get away with it any longer.

33:22.261 --> 33:25.046
Because I am
going to destroy you,

33:25.090 --> 33:27.440
if it's the last thing I do.

33:27.483 --> 33:28.571
William...

33:30.443 --> 33:31.618
William?

33:35.274 --> 33:36.884
The launch is going great,
don't you think?

33:38.103 --> 33:39.408
Sure is, Ms. Rojas.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.027
Dreamer?

33:55.207 --> 33:56.773
That's a huge wave!

34:03.041 --> 34:04.694
Brainy, I hope this works.

34:21.449 --> 34:23.148
Everybody get to high ground!

34:23.190 --> 34:24.062
Go!

34:26.976 --> 34:29.067
Right. I got you. Down!

34:49.435 --> 34:51.045
Go! Everybody move, move!

35:11.935 --> 35:13.154
Hmm.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.245
Now!

35:32.391 --> 35:33.653
Did he say anything?

35:33.696 --> 35:36.177
He isn't talking.
Even with the Truth Seeker.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.310
But he said "they."

35:38.353 --> 35:40.050
"They" told him
to do what he did.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.443
He has to know something.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.229
But according to Brainy,
I mean, the tech he wears

35:44.272 --> 35:45.926
is biologically adhered

35:45.969 --> 35:48.798
and it functions as
some sort of mental armor.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.191
We can't get to him.

35:50.235 --> 35:53.020
Also, it wasn't the Rojases.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.631
-What?
-We ran the analytics.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.285
Okay, flooding the West Coast

35:57.329 --> 36:00.027
would've taken out
Obsidian North's
manufacturing hub.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.072
And if you and J'onn
hadn't stopped the geyser,

36:02.116 --> 36:03.944
then they would've
lost billions.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.338
I gotta say, I'm glad that
I don't have to tell Kelly

36:06.381 --> 36:08.383
that her boss is a crime lord.

36:08.427 --> 36:12.170
But this still leaves us
with a case
that doesn't make any sense.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.433
If it wasn't Andrea
and the Rojases,

36:14.476 --> 36:16.217
who was calling the shots?

36:16.261 --> 36:17.871
Someone has to be behind this.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.089
I agree.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.743
And whoever it is,
we're gonna find them.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.224
It just might take longer
than we thought.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.098
There's something
you both should see.

36:49.337 --> 36:52.427
-Kelly, you okay?

36:52.471 --> 36:53.863
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

36:53.907 --> 36:54.951
Yeah.

36:55.430 --> 36:56.692
Yeah.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.000
Yesterday was just, um,

37:00.609 --> 37:01.915
a lot.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.830
With everything that happened
at the waterfront.

37:04.657 --> 37:07.399
And Alex was...
She was amazing.

37:07.442 --> 37:10.315
But I was there

37:11.403 --> 37:14.014
and I almost saw her die.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.408
I guess it triggered me.

37:16.451 --> 37:17.757
I'm so sorry.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.239
Look, I know that Alex
can take care of herself.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.284
I do. But...

37:27.332 --> 37:29.986
My fiancé died
fighting on the front lines,

37:31.510 --> 37:32.859
and I never got over it.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.819
This brought it all back.

37:39.387 --> 37:42.347
I just... I can't shake
this feeling of...

37:45.698 --> 37:47.526
...dread.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.006
Well, it sounds to me
like you could use a friend.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.533
Do you wanna
grab lunch sometime and talk?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.013
I'd like that.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.538
Thank you.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.545
It is finished.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.027
What is?

38:11.071 --> 38:13.378
I have clarity on how
to dispose of my brother,

38:13.421 --> 38:16.990
now that you've removed
my mental block.

38:17.033 --> 38:18.252
But I didn't remove it.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.342
I could never let you
hurt another person.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.562
We had a deal.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.694
If you intuited anything
about my research,
you'd know that.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.441
You like it here, don't you?

38:33.485 --> 38:34.529
Yes.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.184
I like it here.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.969
I like it very much.

38:55.420 --> 38:56.812
You look beautiful.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.598
Well, I did wear
your favorite color.

39:00.773 --> 39:01.991
Um...

39:02.035 --> 39:04.429
I'm so sorry that I missed
our date-aversary

39:04.472 --> 39:05.908
and your voicemail.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.520
But you know what
we're up against.

39:08.563 --> 39:12.350
You were incredibly brave.

39:12.393 --> 39:15.091
-Well, I've developed
a few skills over the years.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.702
Um...

39:16.745 --> 39:19.487
Hey. Uh, come here.
I... I got you something.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.533
Oh, I got you something, too,

39:21.576 --> 39:23.012
but I forgot to bring it.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.014
Oh, that's okay. This isn't
our real date-aversary.

39:25.058 --> 39:27.974
So when it is,
you can give it to me then.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.324
Close your eyes.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.370
-Close them.
-Okay.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.332
Okay, open.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.989
A Schadel XG-1000.

39:43.032 --> 39:45.426
So you can be
my riding partner.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.997
This is amazing.

39:52.781 --> 39:55.218
I'm just so glad that
we can be together right now.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.787
Thank you.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.147
Don't worry.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.323
I didn't confront Andrea.

40:13.367 --> 40:14.673
Though, believe me,
I wanted to.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.459
Now, I'm even more
confused than ever.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.505
The Rojases
would've lost everything

40:20.548 --> 40:21.810
if Rip Roar had succeeded.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.684
If they're not the villains,
then who?

40:25.727 --> 40:28.208
And now it gets
even more confusing.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.383
Um...

40:30.689 --> 40:32.647
The DEO caught Rip Roar

40:33.561 --> 40:35.215
and they were able to ID him.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.565
It's Russell.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.525
No. What?

40:40.568 --> 40:42.396
That's... That's not possible.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.662
I thought they killed him.

40:47.706 --> 40:50.665
All of this
was to avenge his death.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.058
I don't believe it.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.452
What could they have done
to turn him into that...

40:55.496 --> 40:56.584
monster?

40:57.280 --> 40:58.456
I'm so sorry.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.503
I know how painful this is.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.506
But now that
we have him in custody,

41:05.550 --> 41:06.638
the good thing is

41:06.681 --> 41:08.770
we can finally
get you some answers.

41:08.814 --> 41:10.598
About him, about Andrea,

41:10.642 --> 41:12.600
about any other questions
we might uncover.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.126
Thank you.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.782
You know I didn't want you
involved in this.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.176
But I don't know how I would've
done it without you.

41:27.572 --> 41:28.747
Thank you.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.057
You've really outdone yourself
with those contact lenses.

41:35.101 --> 41:38.191
I hear they're as omnipresent
as one of our plagues

41:38.234 --> 41:39.453
or floods.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.802
That was you yesterday?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.804
Leviathan is everywhere.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.719
And now a problem has come up.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.416
We need you to fix it.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.201
It's Rip Roar.
