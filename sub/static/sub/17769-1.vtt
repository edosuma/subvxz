01:35.389 --> 01:37.778
Once upon a time,
many years ago...

01:37.821 --> 01:40.755
two burglars broke into our
neighbor's house in Rockaway.

01:40.797 --> 01:43.034
Mr. and Mrs. Needleman
had gone to a movie...

01:43.069 --> 01:44.979
and the following
events occurred.

01:55.645 --> 01:58.428
I say we should answer
the phone.

01:58.461 --> 02:00.371
Do you wanna wake up
the whole neighborhood?

02:05.213 --> 02:06.161
Hello?

02:06.205 --> 02:07.831
You, Mr. Marty Needleman...

02:07.869 --> 02:10.073
have been chosen
from the telephone book to...

02:10.109 --> 02:12.181
guess that tune!

02:14.845 --> 02:16.187
Jesus.

02:22.493 --> 02:24.980
Can you tell us
what is the tune...

02:25.021 --> 02:26.963
the orchestra is playing?

02:27.005 --> 02:27.932
I can't hear it.

02:27.965 --> 02:28.947
Would you turn on the radio?

02:28.989 --> 02:30.233
Find the radio
and turn it on!

02:30.269 --> 02:31.217
What's going on?

02:31.261 --> 02:32.189
I can't hear.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.203
What are you doing?

02:33.245 --> 02:34.292
I think I know it.

02:34.333 --> 02:35.260
Come on.

02:35.293 --> 02:36.886
Jesus.

02:44.093 --> 02:45.337
"Dancing in the Dark"!

02:45.373 --> 02:47.282
That's right!

02:53.117 --> 02:54.808
And nowfor question 2...

02:54.845 --> 02:57.365
on the way
to the grand jackpot.

02:57.405 --> 02:59.161
Here's the tune.

03:09.373 --> 03:10.583
"Chinatown, My Chinatown."

03:10.621 --> 03:11.832
That's correct!

03:18.845 --> 03:21.398
And now, the chance
for the grand jackpot...

03:21.437 --> 03:22.812
with all the prizes.

03:22.845 --> 03:26.042
This one is not so easy,
so get ready.

03:31.293 --> 03:32.242
I know that!

03:33.053 --> 03:34.482
I know that. I know.

03:34.525 --> 03:35.453
What?

03:35.485 --> 03:36.914
"The Sailor's Hornpipe."

03:38.173 --> 03:39.602
"The Sailor's Hornpipe"?

03:39.645 --> 03:41.336
That's right!

03:41.373 --> 03:45.683
Mr. Marty Needleman,
you've won the grand jackpot!

03:47.517 --> 03:48.946
Ahh! I'm rich!

03:53.949 --> 03:55.956
That night, the Needlemans
returned home...

03:55.997 --> 03:57.852
and were shocked to find
a ransacked apartment...

03:57.885 --> 03:59.990
with $50
and some silverware missing.

04:00.029 --> 04:02.582
But the following morning,
a truck arrived.

04:10.045 --> 04:13.788
Let's all sing
like the birdies sing

04:13.821 --> 04:16.024
Tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet

04:16.060 --> 04:17.752
Now, I love old radio stories.

04:17.789 --> 04:18.999
And I know a million of 'em.

04:19.036 --> 04:21.721
I've collected 'em down through
the years, like a hobby.

04:21.757 --> 04:23.251
Anecdotes and gossip...

04:23.293 --> 04:25.365
and inside stories
about the stars.

04:25.405 --> 04:27.893
Plus, I recall so many
personal experiences...

04:27.933 --> 04:31.195
from when I grew up and listened
to one show after another.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.650
This girl singing used to be
a favorite at my house...

04:33.693 --> 04:34.871
one of many.

04:34.909 --> 04:36.917
Now it's all gone...

04:36.957 --> 04:38.550
except for the memories.

04:45.853 --> 04:49.814
The scene is Rockaway.
The time is my childhood.

04:49.853 --> 04:50.933
It's my old neighborhood...

04:50.973 --> 04:54.202
and forgive me if I tend
to romanticize the past.

04:54.237 --> 04:57.979
I mean, it wasn't always as
stormy and rain-swept as this.

04:58.013 --> 04:59.322
But I remember it that way...

04:59.357 --> 05:02.838
because that was it
at its most beautiful.

05:02.877 --> 05:06.772
In those days, the radio was
constantly playing at our house.

05:06.813 --> 05:09.944
My mother, for instance, never
missed her favorite show...

05:09.981 --> 05:12.086
"Breakfast with Irene
and Roger."

05:12.125 --> 05:13.652
Good morning, darling.

05:13.693 --> 05:15.155
Pass the orange juice, please.

05:15.197 --> 05:16.407
Very well.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.168
That was quite
an opening night...

05:18.205 --> 05:19.766
we attended last night,
wasn't it?

05:19.805 --> 05:21.463
Yes, wasn't it divine?

05:21.501 --> 05:24.283
Everyone was there, from Rodgers
and Hart to Cole Porter.

05:24.317 --> 05:25.332
Yes, darling.

05:25.373 --> 05:27.795
There were two completely
different worlds.

05:27.837 --> 05:30.684
While my mother stood over
the dirty plates in Rockaway...

05:30.717 --> 05:33.051
Irene and Roger ate
their elegant breakfast...

05:33.085 --> 05:35.768
over the air from their
chic Manhattan townhouse...

05:35.805 --> 05:37.049
while they chatted charmingly...

05:37.085 --> 05:39.507
about people and places
we only dreamt of.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.694
You look marvelous, darling.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.155
Tomorrow morning, we'll be
telling you all about it.

05:43.197 --> 05:45.052
And also about
the new Moss Hart play...

05:45.085 --> 05:46.908
which I hear is just divine.

05:46.941 --> 05:48.403
This is Irene Draper...

05:48.445 --> 05:52.536
and Roger Daley saying have us
for breakfast tomorrow...

05:52.573 --> 05:54.099
and every morning.

05:54.141 --> 05:56.050
And have a wonderful day.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.386
My own personal favorite show...

05:59.421 --> 06:01.396
was something called
"The Masked Avenger"...

06:01.437 --> 06:05.212
who I fantasized was a cross
between Superman and Cary Grant.

06:05.245 --> 06:06.489
Little did I know.

06:06.525 --> 06:08.019
...While I was on the scene?

06:08.061 --> 06:09.654
It's the Masked Avenger.

06:09.693 --> 06:11.122
It's off to jail for you.

06:11.165 --> 06:14.198
I hope you'll enjoy
making license plates.

06:14.237 --> 06:15.546
I'd like to tell you
the story...

06:15.581 --> 06:17.785
of the Masked Avenger's
secret compartment ring...

06:17.821 --> 06:19.763
and how it turned me to crime.

06:19.805 --> 06:21.812
But first,
you have to meet me...

06:21.853 --> 06:22.966
and my family.

06:24.605 --> 06:27.354
There I am in my Masked Avenger
hat and goggles...

06:27.389 --> 06:29.276
which I got off my friend
in a trade.

06:29.309 --> 06:31.676
And then there were
my father and mother...

06:31.709 --> 06:34.393
two people who could find
an argument in any subject.

06:34.429 --> 06:35.411
Wait a minute!

06:35.453 --> 06:36.828
Are you telling me
you think the Atlantic...

06:36.861 --> 06:38.235
is a greater ocean
than the Pacific?

06:38.269 --> 06:40.636
No, have it your way.
The Pacific is greater.

06:40.669 --> 06:43.736
I mean, how many people
fight over oceans?

06:43.773 --> 06:45.234
Then there was my uncle Abe.

06:45.277 --> 06:46.706
He kept bringing home fish...

06:46.749 --> 06:48.691
from his friends who worked
at Sheepshead Bay.

06:48.733 --> 06:51.450
Ceil, I'm home!

06:51.485 --> 06:53.394
Ceil, I got fish!

06:53.437 --> 06:55.542
I got great fish today.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.239
What do we need rawfish for?

06:57.277 --> 06:58.684
And of course my aunt Ceil...

06:58.717 --> 07:00.277
who dreamed
of a more exciting life...

07:00.317 --> 07:02.292
than always having
to filet his flounder.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.511
They're fresh fish!

07:03.549 --> 07:05.142
He has friends
at Oscar's dock...

07:05.181 --> 07:07.090
so he can't spend
a single afternoon there...

07:07.133 --> 07:08.508
where they don't load him up
with fish.

07:08.541 --> 07:10.810
You don't like it,
take the gas pipe.

07:10.845 --> 07:12.633
Next, there was
Grandpa and Grandma.

07:12.669 --> 07:13.847
Every single morning...

07:13.885 --> 07:16.219
he spent a half-hour
packing her into her corset.

07:16.253 --> 07:18.424
I'm pulling, I'm pulling!

07:18.461 --> 07:21.593
A woman in her 70s,
and her bosom is still growing.

07:21.629 --> 07:22.611
Nathan!

07:22.653 --> 07:24.792
Abe and Ceil's daughter
was cousin Ruthie...

07:24.829 --> 07:26.837
who entertained herself
by sitting and listening to...

07:26.877 --> 07:28.732
the next-door neighbors
on the party line.

07:28.765 --> 07:30.969
Mrs. Waldbaum's
having her ovaries out.

07:31.005 --> 07:32.215
Both or one?

07:32.253 --> 07:34.195
Get off the line, OK?

07:34.237 --> 07:36.538
Stop listening in on my phone!

07:36.573 --> 07:37.817
Stop snooping on us!

07:37.853 --> 07:38.998
All right, all right.

07:39.037 --> 07:40.531
Don't get your bowels
in an uproar.

07:40.573 --> 07:41.620
Nobody's snooping.

07:41.661 --> 07:44.214
Oh, yeah? My wife
hears her breathing!

07:44.253 --> 07:45.333
And she giggles!

07:45.373 --> 07:47.642
Hey, Waldbaum. Waldbaum...

07:47.677 --> 07:49.913
you think we care
what goes on in your house?

07:49.949 --> 07:54.007
Let them take her ovaries out.
What's it our business?

07:54.045 --> 07:56.216
Mrs. Waldbaum had
a steel plate in her head...

07:56.253 --> 07:58.675
and it was said she couldn't
walk near magnets.

08:00.765 --> 08:05.075
Finally, there was Aunt Bea,
who only wanted to get married.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.327
This is a Lindy.

08:06.365 --> 08:09.714
My dancing teacher gave me
this great new step for it.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.001
Hey, Tess?

08:11.677 --> 08:12.659
Tess, I can't decide...

08:12.701 --> 08:14.905
if I should take
my vacation on a cruise...

08:14.941 --> 08:16.403
or go to the mountains.

08:16.445 --> 08:19.063
I mean, the men
are richer on a cruise...

08:19.101 --> 08:21.402
but there's more of them
in the resorts.

08:21.437 --> 08:22.844
What do you think, Tess?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.885
Well, I met my husband
at a mountain resort...

08:24.925 --> 08:26.681
so I'd advise you
to go on a cruise.

08:26.717 --> 08:27.961
That's very funny.

08:27.997 --> 08:29.819
Can we get back to my idea?

08:29.853 --> 08:32.635
We buy cultured pearls.
We box 'em here in velvet...

08:32.669 --> 08:33.813
and we sell 'em mail order.

08:33.852 --> 08:34.998
I can get a good price.

08:35.037 --> 08:36.924
You were in jewelry.
It didn't work.

08:36.957 --> 08:39.160
We got stuck with
the rhinestone earrings.

08:39.197 --> 08:41.172
You don't have
a business head.

08:41.212 --> 08:42.937
You got stuck with
mail order parts...

08:42.972 --> 08:44.315
you tried seeds...

08:44.349 --> 08:46.553
then you lost money
selling greeting cards.

08:46.589 --> 08:49.239
You know we have 6,000
"get well" cards in the closet?

08:49.277 --> 08:51.448
There aren't that many
sick people in America.

08:51.485 --> 08:53.786
Forget it. I'll spend the rest
of my life at the job I do.

08:53.821 --> 08:55.195
There's nothing
wrong with it.

08:55.229 --> 08:56.276
What do you do, Dad?

08:56.317 --> 08:57.430
It's none of your business.

08:57.469 --> 08:59.356
All my friends know what
their dads do for a living.

08:59.389 --> 09:00.567
Don't you have
any homework?

09:00.605 --> 09:02.547
Hey, can I have 15 cents
for the new Masked Avenger ring?

09:02.589 --> 09:04.051
No. What am I,
made of money?

09:04.093 --> 09:05.467
Pay more attention
to your schoolwork...

09:05.501 --> 09:06.679
and less to the radio!

09:06.717 --> 09:08.604
You always listen to the radio.

09:08.637 --> 09:10.906
It's different.
Our lives are ruined already.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.461
You still have a chance
to grow up and be somebody.

09:13.501 --> 09:15.509
You think I want you working
at the job I do?

09:15.549 --> 09:16.978
I don't even know
what your job is.

09:17.021 --> 09:18.363
You gotta get an education.

09:18.397 --> 09:20.601
While I'm getting it, can I get
the secret compartment ring?

09:20.637 --> 09:22.677
We don't have
money to waste.

09:22.717 --> 09:24.342
Do you think we all
like living together?

09:24.381 --> 09:27.228
We'd like to save up,
maybe have another child.

09:27.261 --> 09:29.235
Your father works all day
like a horse...

09:29.277 --> 09:30.455
supporting everybody.

09:30.493 --> 09:32.914
- At what?
- He's a big butter-and-egg man.

09:32.957 --> 09:34.997
What do you mean, "our lives
are ruined already"?

09:35.037 --> 09:36.183
I didn't mean "ruined" ruined.

09:36.221 --> 09:39.090
We're poor, but happy.
But definitely poor.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.042
Isn't this a beautiful sea bass?

09:41.085 --> 09:44.500
Who wants to join me, hmm?

09:47.133 --> 09:48.540
By now, you've
probably guessed...

09:48.573 --> 09:50.483
that the Masked Avenger's
secret compartment ring...

09:50.525 --> 09:52.151
meant a lot to me.

09:52.189 --> 09:53.116
Well, it did.

09:53.149 --> 09:55.091
Because they were gold
and mysterious...

09:55.133 --> 09:56.562
and they fit any finger.

09:56.605 --> 09:58.394
The box top, I already had.

09:58.429 --> 10:01.877
But the 15 cents was hard
to come by in those days.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.543
I tried not thinking about it...

10:03.581 --> 10:06.429
but it was very hard
to keep off my mind.

10:06.461 --> 10:08.349
And the masts and the sail.

10:08.381 --> 10:10.618
You even have to work
with the tweezers...

10:10.653 --> 10:12.476
to get some
of the small stuff in.

10:12.509 --> 10:13.916
I'll pass it around.

10:13.949 --> 10:15.290
That was lovely, Evelyn.

10:15.325 --> 10:16.273
Arnold, why don't you
come up...

10:16.317 --> 10:17.943
and show the class
what you have?

10:17.981 --> 10:19.836
Just go stand right over there.
Go ahead.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.724
I found this
on my parents' night table.

10:21.757 --> 10:23.251
That will be enough!
You go sit down!

10:23.293 --> 10:25.300
What did I do?
You told me to bring something.

10:25.341 --> 10:26.967
Put that thing in your pocket
and sit down!

10:27.005 --> 10:28.249
Ross, why don't you
come up here?

10:28.285 --> 10:30.358
You have something suitable
to show the class, don't you?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.325
Yes, I do.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.666
Very good. Stand right here.

10:32.701 --> 10:36.083
This is my Masked Avenger
secret compartment ring.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.586
It's very special to me.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.996
Now basically,
I was an honest kid.

10:40.029 --> 10:41.436
But there are some things
in life...

10:41.469 --> 10:43.771
that are just too compelling.

10:43.805 --> 10:47.285
That afternoon at Hebrew school,
a scheme occurred to me.

10:47.325 --> 10:53.305
Next week, we are going
to issue collection boxes...

10:53.341 --> 10:57.367
and each of you will be
asked to go out in the street...

10:57.405 --> 11:01.082
and collect funds
for the promotion...

11:01.117 --> 11:04.052
of a new state in Palestine.

11:04.093 --> 11:05.686
Hey, can you give
to the Jewish National Fund...

11:05.725 --> 11:08.344
and help us build a homeland
in Palestine? Please? No?

11:08.381 --> 11:09.625
Hey, how about you?

11:09.661 --> 11:11.068
Can you give to
the Jewish National Fund?

11:11.101 --> 11:12.595
Can you help us? Anything?

11:12.637 --> 11:13.847
Hey, how about--

11:13.885 --> 11:15.892
Can you? Can you? No? Oh.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.722
Give to
the Jewish National Fund?

11:17.757 --> 11:19.546
Hey, can you give us--
Hey, excuse me.

11:19.581 --> 11:22.996
Can you--give it to me,
please. Thank you.

11:24.221 --> 11:26.610
Guys, we got enough here
to get Masked Avenger rings...

11:26.653 --> 11:27.962
and an ice-cream soda.

11:27.997 --> 11:29.623
We gotta leave some
for Palestine.

11:29.661 --> 11:31.384
Why should we leave anything
for Palestine?

11:31.421 --> 11:32.533
It's all the way over in Egypt.

11:32.573 --> 11:34.580
It's a sin. What if
the rabbi catches us?

11:34.621 --> 11:36.923
Hey, they'll never find out.
Besides, I can handle him.

11:36.957 --> 11:37.885
You sure?

11:37.917 --> 11:38.866
Positive.

11:38.909 --> 11:42.138
Dimes! I got 4 dimes!

11:42.173 --> 11:45.468
Monies for
our Jewish homeland...

11:45.501 --> 11:48.567
used to buy this
"masked adventure" ring?!

11:48.605 --> 11:50.580
My heart is full of grief.

11:50.621 --> 11:52.377
It swells with anguish!

11:52.413 --> 11:54.039
He'll pay back every cent.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.452
- Yup.
- Shut up.

11:55.485 --> 11:57.460
I don't know what to do, Rabbi.

11:57.501 --> 11:58.810
Every night,
he listens to the radio.

11:58.845 --> 12:00.372
I can't keep him away.

12:00.413 --> 12:01.722
I say, "Go to the beach.

12:01.757 --> 12:03.896
"Play in the sun.
Get some fresh air."

12:03.933 --> 12:06.781
No. "The Lone Ranger,"
"The Shadow,"...

12:06.813 --> 12:08.057
"The Masked Avenger."

12:08.093 --> 12:10.995
This is not good.
This boy needs discipline.

12:11.037 --> 12:13.972
Radio, it's all right
once in a while.

12:14.013 --> 12:17.329
Otherwise, it tends
to induce bad values...

12:17.373 --> 12:20.952
false dreams, lazy habits.

12:20.989 --> 12:22.036
Listening to the radio...

12:22.077 --> 12:24.183
these stories
of foolishness and violence...

12:24.221 --> 12:26.457
this is no way
for a boy to grow up!

12:26.493 --> 12:30.137
You speak the truth,
my faithful Indian companion.

12:30.173 --> 12:33.020
To a rabbi you say "my
faithful Indian companion"?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.198
Hey, hey.
Don't hit my son!

12:34.237 --> 12:36.092
What kind of upbringing is this?

12:36.125 --> 12:37.848
Look, I'll hit him,
but you don't hit him.

12:37.885 --> 12:39.292
I know better
how to teach the children!

12:39.325 --> 12:41.113
I said, I'll hit him!
You leave him alone!

12:41.149 --> 12:43.637
No, I'll hit him
because you are too lenient!

12:43.677 --> 12:44.625
Oh, I'm lenient? Watch.

12:44.669 --> 12:46.076
That's lenient?
That's lenient?!

12:46.109 --> 12:48.979
I am a faithful Indian?
Such an impertinence?

12:49.021 --> 12:50.581
Rabbi, I will teach
him some manners.

12:50.621 --> 12:51.832
Yeah, I'll show him lenient.

12:51.869 --> 12:52.797
Think that's lenient?

12:52.829 --> 12:55.447
Enough, enough.
You'll hurt the boy.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.898
And so, that ended
my career in crime.

12:58.941 --> 13:01.559
And I never did get
the Masked Avenger ring.

13:01.597 --> 13:02.742
But to this day...

13:02.781 --> 13:07.254
I still get chills when
I recall his famous sign-off.

13:07.293 --> 13:08.886
Be sure and tune in tomorrow...

13:08.925 --> 13:11.259
for another adventure
of "The Masked Avenger"...

13:11.293 --> 13:13.049
when he flies over
the city rooftops...

13:13.085 --> 13:15.452
and we all hear his cry...

13:15.485 --> 13:18.681
Beware, evildoers,
wherever you are!

13:25.853 --> 13:27.194
Tess, did you see my yellow bag?

13:27.229 --> 13:28.156
I didn't touch it.

13:28.189 --> 13:30.164
Aw. Ooh, what is that?

13:30.205 --> 13:31.132
Ooh, turn it up.

13:31.165 --> 13:32.092
What's the fuss?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.052
She's got a big date.

13:33.085 --> 13:34.743
Mr. Manulis
finally asked her out.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.861
Oh, what'd he do,
go blind?

13:35.901 --> 13:37.177
Him with the insults, right?

13:37.213 --> 13:38.195
Hey!

13:38.237 --> 13:39.764
You should go tell her
that she looks nice.

13:39.805 --> 13:40.852
Yeah. I'll tell her,
I'll tell her.

13:40.893 --> 13:43.260
Mrs. Waldbaum found a pocketbook
in the subway...

13:43.293 --> 13:45.595
and she doesn't think
she's gonna give it back.

13:45.629 --> 13:47.320
You ought to stop listening.

13:47.357 --> 13:48.601
Tess, can I borrow
your anchor pin?

13:48.637 --> 13:49.619
Well, sure, sure.

13:49.661 --> 13:51.352
Oh, God, he's so handsome!

13:51.389 --> 13:53.975
I waited so long.
I never thought he'd ask me.

13:54.013 --> 13:54.940
Where'd you meet him?

13:54.973 --> 13:56.599
In the Catskills.
He rides horseback...

13:56.637 --> 13:58.971
he dances,
he's some tennis player.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.209
Sounds like a perfect victim.
What's he do for a living?

14:01.245 --> 14:02.554
His firm imports coffee.

14:02.589 --> 14:03.701
What do you do
for a living, Dad?

14:03.741 --> 14:04.886
Get my cigarettes,
will you?

14:04.925 --> 14:06.780
Oh, this could be the answer
to my prayers.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.701
Bea, don't you think it's
about time you compromised?

14:08.733 --> 14:09.661
I don't know the meaning
of that word.

14:09.693 --> 14:11.319
So stay single.

14:11.357 --> 14:13.976
Do you smell my perfume?
It's good, right?

14:14.973 --> 14:18.999
Oh, gosh. OK, uh,
Ceil. Ceil, get it!

14:19.037 --> 14:20.532
I don't want to appear
too anxious.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.361
I've been cleaning
fish all afternoon.

14:22.397 --> 14:23.771
That man never stops
bringing home fish.

14:23.805 --> 14:24.732
I'll get it.

14:24.765 --> 14:26.652
Oh, my gosh. My glasses.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.114
Coming. I'm coming.

14:28.157 --> 14:29.717
Almost forgot my glasses.

14:29.757 --> 14:32.213
Oh, well, hello. Come on in.

14:32.253 --> 14:33.747
Would you come in, please?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.350
I'm Bea's sister, Tess.

14:35.389 --> 14:37.364
Well, how do you do?
Is Bea ready?

14:37.405 --> 14:39.314
Oh, she'll only be a minute.

14:39.357 --> 14:41.245
This is most of my family.

14:41.277 --> 14:42.357
Hello, hello!

14:42.397 --> 14:43.826
And this is my husband.

14:43.869 --> 14:46.105
Ah, pleased. Pleased!

14:46.141 --> 14:47.318
That's quite
a firm handshake you got.

14:47.357 --> 14:48.284
Oh, well, sure.

14:48.317 --> 14:49.626
I hate when somebody
shakes your hand...

14:49.661 --> 14:52.182
they put a dead paw in it.
You know what I mean?

14:53.981 --> 14:55.574
Have you been waiting long?

14:55.613 --> 14:57.206
Oh, not at all,
sugar. Hey.

14:57.245 --> 14:58.674
Well, have a very nice time.

14:58.717 --> 15:00.626
Yeah. Come on, sugar.
It's into the old jalopy.

15:00.669 --> 15:02.011
We're gonna paint
the town red!

15:04.125 --> 15:06.263
Oh, gosh.
Didn't Bea look lovely?

15:06.301 --> 15:08.057
What did she do?
Fall into a vat of perfume?

15:08.093 --> 15:10.198
You know, when we were younger,
of the 3 sisters...

15:10.237 --> 15:11.731
she used to be
considered the pretty one.

15:11.773 --> 15:12.722
Some contest.

15:12.765 --> 15:13.779
Oh, what do you know?

15:13.821 --> 15:16.887
You're lucky I love you,
you old goose bag.

15:24.797 --> 15:28.146
Aunt Bea and Mr. Manulis
were having a wonderful time.

15:28.189 --> 15:30.164
He took her out for
the evening to Coney Island...

15:30.205 --> 15:31.699
where they went roller-skating.

15:31.741 --> 15:33.596
And although she had
never roller-skated...

15:33.629 --> 15:34.938
before in her life...

15:34.973 --> 15:37.657
in his capable hands,
she did her best.

15:37.693 --> 15:39.995
He took her for oysters
and beer.

15:40.029 --> 15:41.851
And as she later
told the story...

15:41.885 --> 15:44.340
she was shy about having
to wear glasses...

15:44.381 --> 15:47.316
and kept trying to hide the fact
that she needed them.

15:47.357 --> 15:50.041
Aunt Bea was really developing
a crush on Mr. Manulis...

15:50.077 --> 15:53.044
and as they ate and joked,
it would've been impossible...

15:53.085 --> 15:55.256
to guess that
their evening together...

15:55.293 --> 15:58.327
would soon end
in total disaster.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.980
Oh, did I have
I wonderful time.

16:06.013 --> 16:07.987
I'm still a little tipsy
from that beer.

16:08.029 --> 16:09.590
Oh, really?
'Cause you only had one.

16:09.629 --> 16:12.247
I know, but alcohol
affects me strongly.

16:12.285 --> 16:14.107
And you,
how can you even drive?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.636
You must have had 5 beers.

16:15.677 --> 16:17.465
Well, I'm a big boy.
I could have 10.

16:17.501 --> 16:19.541
Oh, and it's so foggy.

16:19.581 --> 16:21.436
Yeah. I love the fog.

16:21.469 --> 16:22.876
It's very romantic.

16:24.445 --> 16:25.460
What's that?

16:26.685 --> 16:27.830
Oh, you're not gonna
believe this...

16:27.869 --> 16:29.146
but we're out of gas.

16:29.181 --> 16:31.603
Oh, gosh.
Wouldn't you know it?

16:31.645 --> 16:34.230
Right out here on the tip
of Breezy Point, too.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.952
Hmm. Looks like
we're stuck here.

16:36.989 --> 16:38.166
Least till the fog lifts.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.882
Oh, well. What's a girl to do?

16:46.621 --> 16:51.226
Oh, Sidney. Oh, Sidney,
this is our first date together.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.465
Aw, Bea, you know
how I feel about you.

16:53.501 --> 16:54.581
We interrupt this program...

16:54.621 --> 16:56.181
to bring you a special
news bulletin.

16:56.221 --> 16:57.782
A state of emergency
has been declared...

16:57.821 --> 16:59.610
by the President
of the United States.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.979
We're switching live
to Wilson's Glen, New Jersey...

17:02.013 --> 17:04.402
where the landing of hundreds
of unidentified spacecraft...

17:04.444 --> 17:05.874
has now been officially
confirmed...

17:05.916 --> 17:09.114
as a full-scale invasion
of the Earth by Martians.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.460
I can't believe my eyes--

17:14.492 --> 17:17.144
Dying... being trampled
in their efforts to escape.

17:17.181 --> 17:20.181
The power lines
are down everywhere.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.522
We could be cut off
at any moment.

17:22.557 --> 17:24.597
Oh, my gosh!

17:24.637 --> 17:26.262
There's another group
of spaceships.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.170
The alien ships
are coming out of the sky.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.740
Despite his bravado
all evening...

17:30.781 --> 17:33.781
Mr. Manulis panicked
and bolted out of the car.

17:33.821 --> 17:35.250
He was so frightened
by the reports...

17:35.293 --> 17:37.846
of interplanetary invasion
that he ran off...

17:37.885 --> 17:41.081
leaving Aunt Bea to contend with
the slimy green monsters...

17:41.117 --> 17:43.932
he expected to drop
from the sky at any moment.

17:43.965 --> 17:46.965
She walked home 6 miles.

17:47.005 --> 17:49.624
When Mr. Manulis called her
for a date the next week...

17:49.661 --> 17:52.050
she told my mother to tell him
she couldn't see him anymore.

17:52.093 --> 17:53.751
She had married a Martian.

18:00.029 --> 18:01.109
Now, earlier...

18:01.149 --> 18:04.466
I promised some inside stories
about the stars.

18:04.509 --> 18:06.102
Well, here's
a little something...

18:06.141 --> 18:09.589
that actually happened one night
with Roger and Irene.

18:09.629 --> 18:11.734
Everyone's here tonight,
sweetheart.

18:11.773 --> 18:13.976
Isn't that Richard?
Oh, Richard!

18:14.653 --> 18:15.830
We saw that show at the Morosco.

18:15.869 --> 18:16.949
You're right. It's terrific.

18:16.989 --> 18:18.996
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

18:19.037 --> 18:21.339
I thought I saw Ernest Hemingway
at the bar, darling.

18:21.373 --> 18:23.958
Well, I heard
he was in town, actually.

18:23.997 --> 18:25.404
Cigars. Cigarettes.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.549
Oh, I'll have some Camels.

18:26.589 --> 18:27.701
Hello, Mr. Daley.

18:27.741 --> 18:30.555
Where have you been?
You don't return my calls.

18:30.589 --> 18:31.516
I can never get ahold of you.

18:31.549 --> 18:33.011
I told you it was over.

18:33.053 --> 18:34.133
Please don't say that!

18:34.173 --> 18:35.733
You call me all hours.

18:35.773 --> 18:38.326
I mean, I meet you
in hotel rooms...

18:38.365 --> 18:41.048
in the back of cars,
in stalled elevators...

18:41.085 --> 18:43.059
you're gonna lose your respect
for me.

18:43.101 --> 18:45.402
Please don't be
unreasonable.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.518
Cigars. Cigarettes.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.913
Cigar, please.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.469
Thank you very much.

19:04.349 --> 19:06.520
Sally, you can't
just break it off now.

19:06.557 --> 19:07.484
I'm in love with you.

19:07.517 --> 19:08.444
Yeah.

19:08.477 --> 19:09.404
If you loved me...

19:09.437 --> 19:11.193
you'd leave
your wife and marry me.

19:11.229 --> 19:13.117
Well, I can't do that.
Our ratings are too high.

19:13.149 --> 19:14.077
Hi, Roger.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.037
Oh, hi.

19:15.069 --> 19:16.476
Lucky Strikes, please.

19:16.509 --> 19:17.938
Tico-tico!

20:03.581 --> 20:06.200
I look at you,
and I'm aflame with longing.

20:06.237 --> 20:09.106
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I'm a single girl.

20:09.149 --> 20:12.498
I want you, Sally.
I crave you.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.777
I've already spoken to the head
of the agency about you.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.154
He wants to meet you.

20:16.189 --> 20:17.399
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:17.437 --> 20:20.154
I told him you were the most
promising young actress...

20:20.189 --> 20:21.498
I'd seen in years.

20:21.533 --> 20:24.086
But you've
never even seen me act.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.532
I've got great intuition...

20:25.565 --> 20:27.539
and I care so much about you.

20:27.581 --> 20:29.272
I've just got
to have you, Sally.

20:29.309 --> 20:31.764
I'm exploding with desire.

20:31.805 --> 20:35.121
We can't do it now.
I'm working my shift.

20:35.165 --> 20:37.531
There must be somewhere we
can be alone for a few minutes.

20:37.565 --> 20:40.053
I'd be taking
a real chance.

20:40.093 --> 20:41.686
I told my wife
I was going to have a drink...

20:41.725 --> 20:43.034
with Richard Rodgers.

20:43.069 --> 20:45.786
You know, we always table hop
for a long time.

20:45.821 --> 20:48.604
Well, let me think.

20:48.637 --> 20:50.525
And so, as the story goes...

20:50.557 --> 20:51.964
Roger and Sally set out...

20:51.997 --> 20:54.069
to find a secluded
trysting place...

20:54.109 --> 20:55.353
while Roger's wife Irene...

20:55.389 --> 20:57.942
spent her time
drinking and hobnobbing...

20:57.981 --> 21:01.778
with society's most interesting
and exotic Latin playboy.

21:12.349 --> 21:15.830
I think it's probably
pretty safe up here.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.747
And under the stars

21:22.781 --> 21:25.301
An orchestra's playing

21:25.341 --> 21:27.446
Listen, I only got
a 10-minute break.

21:27.485 --> 21:29.143
Come here, baby.

21:37.661 --> 21:39.068
He wants to meet me?

21:39.101 --> 21:40.083
Who?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.587
The head of the agency.

21:41.629 --> 21:42.971
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:43.005 --> 21:45.722
Yeah. Come here. Yeah.

21:46.973 --> 21:47.900
Oh, wait.

21:47.933 --> 21:48.980
Can you take this off?

21:49.021 --> 21:50.069
Yeah, sure.

21:53.213 --> 21:55.002
Yeah, there you go.

21:55.037 --> 21:56.564
You tell him
I could sing?

21:56.605 --> 21:57.750
Sure.

21:57.789 --> 21:58.716
Yeah?

21:58.749 --> 22:01.116
Like a nightingale.

22:01.149 --> 22:02.077
You told him that?

22:02.109 --> 22:03.538
- Yeah.
- Promise?

22:03.581 --> 22:06.930
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.642
Boy, that was fast.

22:22.685 --> 22:25.270
Probably helped
I had the hiccups.

22:25.309 --> 22:27.219
I have to get back
to the table.

22:28.957 --> 22:30.331
Hey, Sally,
this door's locked.

22:30.365 --> 22:31.575
It is?

22:31.613 --> 22:33.369
It's locked from the inside.

22:35.485 --> 22:36.892
Oh, no.

22:36.925 --> 22:38.867
What are we gonna do?

22:38.909 --> 22:40.469
The trick is not to panic.

22:40.509 --> 22:41.851
There's no other way down.

22:41.885 --> 22:43.859
Well, we'll have
to climb down.

22:43.901 --> 22:46.389
We can't climb down
the side of the building.

22:46.429 --> 22:47.542
What do you think I am?

22:47.581 --> 22:49.272
Didn't you know the door
was locked from the inside?

22:49.309 --> 22:51.513
No. I never actually
came up here...

22:51.549 --> 22:52.858
with anybody but you.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.315
Oh, my God.
What a predicament!

22:55.357 --> 22:57.179
And that's exactly
how it happened.

22:57.213 --> 22:58.806
No matter how hard they tried...

22:58.845 --> 23:01.212
Roger and Sally
could not get back in.

23:01.245 --> 23:04.027
Legend has it that
an electrical storm broke out...

23:04.061 --> 23:05.523
and that he was struck
by lightning--

23:05.565 --> 23:07.670
had to miss his show
for a month.

23:07.709 --> 23:09.781
Another version of the story
I heard...

23:09.821 --> 23:11.414
said that Irene
came up to the roof...

23:11.453 --> 23:13.624
with the same intention
as her husband...

23:13.661 --> 23:15.287
and that Sally got fired.

23:15.325 --> 23:17.300
The other 3 were
so sophisticated...

23:17.341 --> 23:21.335
they all spent a weekend in
the same hotel suite in Havana.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.858
It's terrible.
They have no respect.

23:40.893 --> 23:42.617
They should be thrown
out of the neighborhood.

23:42.653 --> 23:43.962
It's a disgrace.

23:43.997 --> 23:45.655
My nerve's on edge
because I'm so hungry.

23:45.693 --> 23:46.741
You think they fast?

23:46.781 --> 23:48.374
They don't care about
the High Holidays.

23:48.413 --> 23:50.355
They eat, even though
you're supposed to fast.

23:50.397 --> 23:52.732
Grandma can't stand
the radio next door.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.326
It's awful.
It's just awful.

23:54.365 --> 23:56.438
Wait a minute.
Dad, I don't understand.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.200
I thought that you're
allowed to turn it on.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.692
No, no. For 24 hours,
you're supposed to do nothing.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.107
You can't even turn on
a light switch.

24:02.141 --> 24:05.523
Just sit and fast and pray
and atone for your sins.

24:05.565 --> 24:06.677
Well, how come
they're not?

24:06.717 --> 24:08.244
Well, what do they care?
They're communists.

24:08.285 --> 24:09.845
That's right.
They don't believe in religion.

24:09.885 --> 24:11.292
Abe, go speak to them.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.180
What, you want me
to talk to them?

24:13.213 --> 24:14.707
I'd like to burn
their house down...

24:14.749 --> 24:16.440
but I'm not allowed
to light matches today.

24:16.477 --> 24:17.721
If they don't believe it
themselves...

24:17.757 --> 24:20.026
at least they should do it out
of respect for the neighbors.

24:20.061 --> 24:21.140
It's terrible.
They're Jewish...

24:21.181 --> 24:23.155
but they don't believe
in God, just Stalin.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.538
Well, I'm just gonna go
tell them a few things...

24:24.573 --> 24:25.685
that's all.

24:33.981 --> 24:35.028
Hey. Hey, listen.

24:35.069 --> 24:36.246
What the hell are you doing?

24:36.285 --> 24:38.172
Can you turn off the radio?
We're praying in there.

24:38.205 --> 24:39.153
- Praying?
- Yes.

24:39.197 --> 24:40.245
What good is that?
You should be working.

24:40.285 --> 24:41.812
Working for the benefit
of your fellow man.

24:41.853 --> 24:43.413
It is a sin to work today.

24:43.453 --> 24:44.598
It's a sin not to work.

24:44.637 --> 24:45.684
Are you gonna pay
for this fence?

24:45.725 --> 24:47.099
Today is the most holy day.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.694
Can't you please
turn off the radio?

24:48.733 --> 24:50.107
Cut that off.

24:57.149 --> 24:58.675
He's been there over an hour.

24:58.717 --> 25:00.822
Yeah. Meanwhile,
the radio's still on.

25:00.861 --> 25:01.908
Better be careful.

25:01.949 --> 25:03.705
The daughter believes
in free love.

25:03.741 --> 25:04.668
Why do you say that?

25:04.701 --> 25:07.003
You heard what happened
to Mrs. Silverman?

25:07.037 --> 25:08.532
She couldn't sleep.

25:08.573 --> 25:10.809
She was up one night
taking a cup of tea...

25:10.845 --> 25:13.496
and she heard a car pull up
3:00 in the morning.

25:13.533 --> 25:15.355
So, you know Mrs. Silverman.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.723
She always likes
to know what's going on.

25:17.757 --> 25:20.213
So, she's peeking out
her front door...

25:20.253 --> 25:22.489
and there's the girl
across the street...

25:22.525 --> 25:24.313
coming back from
a folk-singing thing...

25:24.349 --> 25:26.520
with a tall colored man.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.662
You're not gonna
believe this, Ceil.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.898
She gives the guy
a big, long kiss.

25:31.933 --> 25:35.316
Well, you can imagine
how Rose Silverman reacted.

25:35.357 --> 25:38.139
She had a stroke on the spot.

25:38.173 --> 25:40.856
Her arteries hardened.
The woman remained frozen...

25:40.893 --> 25:42.933
the teacup
on the way to her mouth.

25:42.973 --> 25:45.875
They never saw anything
like it at the hospital.

25:45.917 --> 25:49.048
I'm telling you, Ceil,
she was as stiff as a board.

25:49.085 --> 25:50.012
I'm home.

25:50.045 --> 25:50.972
It's about time.

25:51.005 --> 25:52.150
Abe, they're still carrying on.

25:52.189 --> 25:53.716
What'd you do there
for over an hour?

25:53.757 --> 25:55.862
Oh, I talked.
Or should I say I listened.

25:55.901 --> 25:56.829
Hey, you didn't eat?

25:56.861 --> 25:57.789
I did eat.

25:57.821 --> 25:58.901
Abe, we're fasting!

25:58.941 --> 26:00.850
They're right.
It's silly.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.038
Oh, my god, Abe.

26:02.077 --> 26:04.149
I mean, look, I should fast
to atone for my sins?

26:04.189 --> 26:06.645
What are my sins?
Who did I bother?

26:06.685 --> 26:08.856
The only sin is
the exploitation...

26:08.893 --> 26:10.169
of the worker by the bosses.

26:10.205 --> 26:11.132
Listen to him.

26:11.165 --> 26:12.342
Did the daughter
get ahold of you?

26:12.381 --> 26:14.617
No, no. You see, the problem
is not between man...

26:14.653 --> 26:16.692
and some imaginary super being.

26:16.733 --> 26:19.002
It's between man
and the owners of 90%...

26:19.037 --> 26:20.150
of the world's wealth.

26:20.189 --> 26:23.037
What do you mean,
some imaginary super being?

26:23.069 --> 26:24.378
You don't believe in God?

26:24.413 --> 26:26.104
Look, religion is
the opium of the masses.

26:26.141 --> 26:27.123
That's the problem.

26:27.165 --> 26:28.114
Abe, God will punish you.

26:28.157 --> 26:32.118
No, God is not interested in--
in me. He--

26:32.157 --> 26:33.466
What's the matter?

26:33.501 --> 26:34.515
What is it?

26:35.421 --> 26:36.348
Abe?

26:36.381 --> 26:37.308
I have chest pains.

26:37.341 --> 26:38.355
Abe, really?
My goodness.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.477
Abe, are you all right?

26:39.517 --> 26:40.761
I can't breathe.

26:40.797 --> 26:41.724
No, stop it.

26:41.757 --> 26:42.684
Just relax. Just relax.

26:42.717 --> 26:44.091
Try. Breathe out slowly.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.034
Abe, I told you
God would punish you.

26:46.077 --> 26:48.117
You see? I was right.
This time he was right.

26:48.157 --> 26:49.084
All right, I'll get
the doctor's number.

26:49.117 --> 26:50.164
Maybe it's indigestion.

26:50.205 --> 26:51.220
What did you
eat over there?

26:51.261 --> 26:52.821
Uh, some pork chops.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.908
Pork chops?

26:53.949 --> 26:55.062
And some clams.

26:55.101 --> 26:56.028
Abe.

26:56.061 --> 26:56.988
And chocolate pudding.

26:57.021 --> 26:58.101
Abe, how could
you do this?

26:58.141 --> 26:59.254
And some french fries.

26:59.293 --> 27:00.984
French fries?
You ate french fries?

27:01.021 --> 27:02.265
You won't eat
my french fries...

27:02.301 --> 27:03.762
but you'll eat the Russian's--
the commie's french fries?

27:03.805 --> 27:05.366
I'm gonna get him
some bicarbonate.

27:05.405 --> 27:07.347
That's too good for him.
He deserves an enema.

27:07.389 --> 27:09.080
Oh, Ceil.

27:09.117 --> 27:10.066
Yeah, right.

27:10.109 --> 27:11.319
Oh.

27:11.485 --> 27:13.144
Hello, sports fans...

27:13.181 --> 27:15.003
and welcome to
today's edition...

27:15.037 --> 27:18.135
of Bill Kern's
"Favorite Sports Legends."

27:18.173 --> 27:19.100
Now, in my family...

27:19.133 --> 27:21.500
each person had
his own favorite show.

27:21.533 --> 27:24.500
For instance, my uncle Abe
was a great sports fan.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.908
And he always listened
to Bill Kern.

27:26.941 --> 27:30.203
Today's story
is about a baseball player.

27:30.237 --> 27:33.554
His name was Kirby Kyle...

27:33.597 --> 27:36.499
a lean southpawfrom Tennessee.

27:36.541 --> 27:39.411
He played for
the old St. Louis Cardinals.

27:39.453 --> 27:41.787
He threwfast, and he
had a good curve ball.

27:41.821 --> 27:43.446
And all the hitters knew it.

27:43.485 --> 27:46.452
He was a kid
with a great future...

27:46.493 --> 27:48.119
but one day...

27:48.157 --> 27:49.466
he went hunting.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.613
He loved to hunt...

27:50.653 --> 27:53.042
just like his father
and his father's father.

27:53.085 --> 27:57.820
Chasing a rabbit, he stumbled,
and his rifle went off.

27:59.325 --> 28:01.213
The bullet entered his leg.

28:01.245 --> 28:04.507
Two days later,
it was amputated.

28:04.541 --> 28:07.411
They said he would
never pitch again.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.395
But the next season,
he was back.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.772
He had one leg...

28:11.805 --> 28:13.944
but he had something
more important.

28:13.981 --> 28:16.916
He had heart.

28:16.957 --> 28:17.939
The following winter...

28:17.981 --> 28:20.916
another accident
cost Kirby Kyle an arm...

28:20.957 --> 28:24.056
fortunately not
his pitching arm.

28:24.093 --> 28:27.127
He had one leg and one arm...

28:27.165 --> 28:29.140
but more than that...

28:29.181 --> 28:31.767
he had heart.

28:31.805 --> 28:33.267
The next winter...

28:33.309 --> 28:35.065
going after duck...

28:35.101 --> 28:37.011
his gun misfired.

28:38.205 --> 28:40.277
He was blind...

28:40.317 --> 28:43.514
but he had instinct as to
where to throw the baseball.

28:43.549 --> 28:46.549
Instinct... and heart.

28:46.589 --> 28:47.963
The following year...

28:47.997 --> 28:51.510
Kirby Kyle was run over
by a truck and killed.

28:51.549 --> 28:53.589
The following season...

28:53.629 --> 28:56.825
he won 18 games...

28:56.861 --> 29:00.636
in the Big League in the sky.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.076
This has been Bill Kern...

29:02.109 --> 29:05.425
with another
favorite sports legend.

29:05.469 --> 29:07.804
Well, to tell you the truth,
you look pretty good.

29:07.837 --> 29:09.725
While uncle Abe loved
the "Bill Kern Sports Show"...

29:09.757 --> 29:13.402
his wife Ceil adored a very
prominent ventriloquist.

29:13.437 --> 29:16.732
And this always used
to drive Abe crazy.

29:16.765 --> 29:18.904
He's a ventriloquist
on the radio.

29:18.941 --> 29:20.916
How do know he's
not moving his lips?

29:20.957 --> 29:22.550
Who cares?
Leave me alone.

29:35.133 --> 29:38.199
Ceil and Abe's daughter Ruthie
had her own favorite program.

29:38.237 --> 29:41.652
Naturally, it was one
of those romantic boy crooners.

29:41.693 --> 29:46.200
She and her girlfriends used
to sit and swoon endlessly...

29:46.237 --> 29:50.198
over the sentimental lyrics
and velvety voice.

29:50.237 --> 29:53.434
The local boys, of course,
were all a little jealous...

29:53.469 --> 29:55.324
and they used
to look on disgustedly...

29:55.357 --> 29:57.658
thinking the girls
were real jerks.

30:07.293 --> 30:09.398
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

30:09.437 --> 30:11.925
the makers of General
Spark Plugs bring you...

30:11.965 --> 30:13.875
"The Court of Human Emotions"...

30:13.917 --> 30:17.113
with world famous counselor
on affairs of the human heart...

30:17.149 --> 30:18.971
Thomas Abercrombie.

30:19.005 --> 30:20.860
And now, my friends--

30:20.893 --> 30:22.900
My mother and father
loved to hear the show...

30:22.941 --> 30:24.501
where ordinary people
were helped...

30:24.541 --> 30:26.199
with their personal problems.

30:26.237 --> 30:27.895
Six years ago, his mother
came to live with us...

30:27.933 --> 30:29.756
and she won't leave
and he won't throw her out.

30:29.789 --> 30:31.796
Claire, how can I throw
my own mother out?

30:31.837 --> 30:33.178
What do you mean?
You grab her by the throat...

30:33.213 --> 30:34.140
and throw her out.

30:34.173 --> 30:35.449
Oh, just like that.
Just like that.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.761
Grab her by the throat
and throw her out.

30:36.797 --> 30:38.936
Why don't you just get
a knife and stick it in here?

30:38.973 --> 30:40.053
That's what
you should do.

30:40.093 --> 30:41.020
I'm not gonna stick
any knife anywhere!

30:41.053 --> 30:42.711
Throw my mother out!

30:42.749 --> 30:44.210
I found the show silly...

30:44.253 --> 30:46.076
and always imagined
my parents on it...

30:46.109 --> 30:48.248
airing their standard
complaints.

30:48.285 --> 30:49.146
He's a business failure.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.675
He never finishes
what he starts.

30:50.717 --> 30:52.441
We're forced to live
with my relatives...

30:52.477 --> 30:53.492
and thank God for them.

30:53.533 --> 30:55.672
And I could have
married Sam Slotkin.

30:55.709 --> 30:56.724
Sam Slotkin's dead.

30:56.765 --> 30:58.838
Yes, but while he was alive,
he was working.

30:58.877 --> 31:00.284
She'd be lost without
her whole family...

31:00.317 --> 31:02.008
around her all the time,
and you should see 'em.

31:02.045 --> 31:03.124
They're like some kind of tribe.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.572
They're like the Huns.
Maybe if I had married...

31:04.605 --> 31:06.263
a more encouraging woman,
who knows?

31:06.301 --> 31:07.511
So who do you
think is right?

31:07.549 --> 31:10.898
I think you both
deserve each other.

31:10.941 --> 31:12.184
What does that mean?

31:12.221 --> 31:14.326
Look, we didn't come here
to be insulted.

31:14.365 --> 31:17.661
I love him, but what
did I do to deserve him?

31:17.693 --> 31:18.937
Naturally,
my folks never were...

31:18.973 --> 31:21.209
on the Mr. Abercrombie program.

31:21.245 --> 31:22.903
In fact,
the only radio celebrity...

31:22.941 --> 31:24.916
any of us ever
really met in person...

31:24.957 --> 31:27.575
was the 14-year-old
mathematical genius...

31:27.613 --> 31:32.402
of a quiz show my father loved
called "The Whiz Kids."

31:32.445 --> 31:34.747
Hey, Tess, that's one of
the kids from the radio.

31:34.781 --> 31:35.894
It's a Whiz Kid.

31:35.933 --> 31:39.064
Hey, Joe, it's one
of the Whiz Kids from the radio.

31:39.101 --> 31:40.443
It's one of the Whiz Kids.

31:40.477 --> 31:42.452
Hey, excuse me.
Pardon me?

31:42.493 --> 31:45.657
We really enjoy
your son on the radio.

31:45.693 --> 31:46.871
You're a real genius.

31:46.909 --> 31:49.365
Yes, I have a 160 I.Q.

31:49.405 --> 31:52.220
And that is extraordinary
by any standards.

31:52.253 --> 31:54.163
This is our son.

31:54.205 --> 31:55.350
Say hello.

31:55.389 --> 31:56.371
Hi.

31:56.413 --> 31:57.754
Charmed to make
your acquaintance.

31:57.789 --> 32:01.466
Although perhaps charmed
is really overstating it.

32:01.501 --> 32:03.192
Your son is a whiz at math.

32:03.229 --> 32:05.913
Hey, quick. What's 1,754
divided into 13 million, huh?

32:05.949 --> 32:07.575
Martin.

32:07.613 --> 32:09.206
Yeah, this palooka
can't even pass...

32:09.245 --> 32:10.739
a simple arithmetic
exam, you know?

32:10.781 --> 32:12.788
And now, if you'll excuse us.

32:15.037 --> 32:17.274
Boy, what a kid.

32:17.309 --> 32:19.546
So well spoken.

32:19.581 --> 32:20.923
Why can't you
be like that, huh?

32:20.957 --> 32:22.201
Why can't you be a genius?

32:22.237 --> 32:23.993
I'll tell you why.
Because you're too busy...

32:24.029 --> 32:25.109
listening to the radio
all the time.

32:25.149 --> 32:26.643
That's why.
Put your hat on.

32:26.685 --> 32:29.783
Put his hat on.
Honest to goodness.

32:45.405 --> 32:47.860
Aunt Bea listened almost
exclusively to music.

32:47.901 --> 32:49.427
Because of her,
I grew up hearing...

32:49.469 --> 32:51.378
the most wonderful songs.

33:00.029 --> 33:01.851
To this day,
there are certain songs...

33:01.885 --> 33:04.504
that no matter where I am,
the minute I hear them...

33:04.541 --> 33:06.330
I get instant memory flashes.

33:15.837 --> 33:17.812
For instance,
every time I hear this song...

33:17.853 --> 33:19.741
I think of Evelyn Goorwitz...

33:19.773 --> 33:22.490
who I had a crush on,
but who didn't like me.

33:29.693 --> 33:31.286
And I remember
her pretty girlfriend...

33:31.325 --> 33:33.048
treating me like
I had the plague.

33:33.085 --> 33:34.808
But eventually,
persistence won out...

33:34.845 --> 33:37.081
and I did break down
her resistance.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.348
I can never hear this song...

33:52.381 --> 33:54.650
without recalling
my parents' anniversary.

33:54.685 --> 33:57.468
It was the only time
I ever saw them kiss.

33:57.501 --> 33:59.257
It was
a very wonderful memory.

34:28.253 --> 34:30.456
Now, when this song
was popular on the radio...

34:30.493 --> 34:32.402
I remember
a strange little event.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.418
My friend Andrew and I
built a snowman...

34:34.460 --> 34:35.670
in front of the school...

34:35.708 --> 34:37.138
and he supplemented
its anatomy...

34:37.181 --> 34:38.774
with a particular vegetable.

34:55.741 --> 34:57.432
Another song that
we listened to on the radio...

34:57.469 --> 34:59.062
was by Carmen Miranda.

34:59.101 --> 35:00.410
I can only think of
my cousin Ruthie...

35:00.445 --> 35:02.038
and how much she loved it.

36:05.181 --> 36:06.555
"Mairzy Doats."

36:06.589 --> 36:09.077
I remember when I first heard
that song on the radio...

36:09.117 --> 36:10.972
and I always associate
its popularity...

36:11.005 --> 36:13.755
with a bizarre incident
when Mr. Zipsky...

36:13.789 --> 36:15.829
normally a very quiet man
in the neighborhood...

36:15.869 --> 36:17.723
had a nervous breakdown
and ran amok...

36:17.757 --> 36:19.764
through the shopping district
of Rockaway.

36:43.581 --> 36:47.323
My most vivid memory connected
with an old radio song...

36:47.357 --> 36:49.528
I associate with the time
that Aunt Bea...

36:49.565 --> 36:51.288
and her then-boyfriend
Chester...

36:51.325 --> 36:53.430
took me into
New York to the movies.

36:53.469 --> 36:55.257
It was the first time
I'd ever seen...

36:55.293 --> 36:57.333
the Radio City Music Hall...

36:57.373 --> 36:59.315
and it was like entering heaven.

36:59.357 --> 37:02.227
I just never saw anything
so beautiful in my life.

38:40.797 --> 38:43.383
OK. Now, remember
Sally the cigarette girl?

38:43.421 --> 38:44.948
Well, I want to come
back to her now...

38:44.989 --> 38:46.844
because there are
some great radio stories...

38:46.877 --> 38:48.284
associated with Sally.

38:48.317 --> 38:49.561
She was one
of those characters...

38:49.597 --> 38:52.118
that always seemed to be around
when things were happening.

38:52.157 --> 38:53.586
Plus, she eventually
became the star...

38:53.629 --> 38:55.516
of my aunt Ceil's favorite show.

38:55.549 --> 38:56.825
But that's later.

38:56.861 --> 38:58.748
Right now,
we find her struggling.

38:58.781 --> 39:01.977
A coat-check girl in a nightclub
run by a mobster.

39:02.013 --> 39:03.606
It's after hours.

39:45.309 --> 39:46.716
Oh, my god!

39:46.749 --> 39:48.691
You killed Mr. Davis!

39:48.733 --> 39:50.489
I saw you shoot him!

39:52.445 --> 39:53.722
No!

39:53.757 --> 39:54.705
Oh, no!

40:08.445 --> 40:10.267
Where are you taking me?

40:10.301 --> 40:12.057
Shut up.
You're gettin' yours.

40:15.165 --> 40:16.441
It's nothing personal.

40:16.477 --> 40:18.582
It's just bad luck
you were a witness.

40:18.621 --> 40:21.239
My whole life I had bad luck.

40:21.277 --> 40:23.000
Me, too.

40:23.037 --> 40:25.241
Where are you from?

40:25.277 --> 40:26.259
Brooklyn.

40:26.301 --> 40:28.057
Yeah? Me, too.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.587
Whereabouts?

40:29.629 --> 40:31.833
Canarsie.

40:31.869 --> 40:33.396
Me, too.

40:33.437 --> 40:34.365
Yeah?

40:34.397 --> 40:35.826
85th Street.

40:35.869 --> 40:37.244
I was 86th Street.

40:37.277 --> 40:38.684
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

40:38.717 --> 40:40.440
You must know Joey's Clam House.

40:40.477 --> 40:42.135
Yeah, I eat there
all the time.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.734
You know, this is
a funny coincidence.

40:43.773 --> 40:45.017
I don't meet anybody...

40:45.053 --> 40:46.198
from the old
neighborhood in years.

40:46.237 --> 40:48.724
I finally do,
and I got to kill her.

40:48.765 --> 40:51.482
You were Freddy White's
daughter, huh?

40:51.517 --> 40:54.332
But I remember you
when you had little pigtails...

40:54.365 --> 40:56.404
and braces on your teeth.

40:56.445 --> 40:59.292
But you were the cutest
little girl in the neighborhood.

40:59.325 --> 41:00.569
Here you are.

41:00.605 --> 41:02.744
You need bullets, too?

41:02.781 --> 41:03.763
Here.

41:03.805 --> 41:04.950
Grazie, Mama, grazie.

41:04.989 --> 41:07.029
Honey, you said that
you enjoy the peppers.

41:07.069 --> 41:08.214
Wait, I'll give you some more.

41:08.253 --> 41:09.333
They're delicious.

41:09.373 --> 41:10.834
Yeah, right here.
Eat some more of these...

41:10.877 --> 41:13.976
because you said you enjoy them
very, very much.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.388
Thank you.

41:15.421 --> 41:17.309
Where are you
gonna dump her body?

41:17.341 --> 41:18.803
I'll dump her body
in Jersey, Mama.

41:18.845 --> 41:20.023
4:00 in the morning...

41:20.061 --> 41:21.883
you want to dump
her body in Jersey?

41:21.917 --> 41:24.251
Dump her in Red Hook.

41:24.285 --> 41:25.332
Sweetheart.

41:25.373 --> 41:27.544
Look, these shrimps
are nice and fresh.

41:27.581 --> 41:28.508
I made them today.

41:28.541 --> 41:31.094
Listen, I ain't
gonna squeal. Honest.

41:31.133 --> 41:32.857
I can keep a secret.

41:32.893 --> 41:35.130
I know everything about
everybody on Broadway.

41:35.165 --> 41:36.758
Really. Places I've worked.

41:36.797 --> 41:38.902
I got secrets on everybody.

41:38.941 --> 41:40.729
Think I go around talking?

41:40.765 --> 41:41.692
But what do you do?

41:41.725 --> 41:43.067
She sings, Mama.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.279
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

41:44.317 --> 41:45.910
Yeah, that's right.
I can act, too.

41:45.949 --> 41:48.316
I'd just do anything
to get on radio.

41:48.349 --> 41:51.032
I'd be happy to give
the weather report...

41:51.069 --> 41:52.760
or interview people.

41:52.797 --> 41:54.007
I think I'm a natural.

41:54.045 --> 41:54.972
Oh.

41:55.005 --> 41:56.052
I'm a great dancer.

41:56.093 --> 41:58.166
But you can't dance on radio!

41:58.205 --> 42:00.092
I know, 'cause
they can't see you.

42:01.053 --> 42:02.166
I know.

42:03.837 --> 42:05.528
Wait. Wait.
Come here, Rocco.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.809
Come here. Come here.

42:06.845 --> 42:10.042
I got to tell you something.
You come over here with me.

42:11.741 --> 42:12.886
Listen to me.

42:12.925 --> 42:15.129
You don't have to fear.
Don't worry about that girl...

42:15.165 --> 42:16.921
because she's
not too fast up here.

42:16.957 --> 42:18.518
She wouldn't make no trouble.

42:18.557 --> 42:19.931
Yeah. Well, I feel
sorry for her, Mama.

42:19.965 --> 42:21.492
She wants to get
into radio so badly...

42:21.533 --> 42:22.940
I think some men
take advantage--

42:22.973 --> 42:24.184
She's so pretty.

42:24.221 --> 42:25.715
Listen to me.

42:25.757 --> 42:27.830
Then your cousin Angelo
could help her.

42:27.869 --> 42:30.684
Yes, because he knows
everybody on radio.

42:30.717 --> 42:32.310
He could get her
any little part...

42:32.349 --> 42:35.447
because they owe him
this favor.

42:35.485 --> 42:36.565
All right.

42:36.605 --> 42:39.060
Now they not only decide
not to bump Sally off...

42:39.101 --> 42:41.687
but they get a relative
to ask an unrefusable favor...

42:41.725 --> 42:42.969
on her behalf.

42:43.005 --> 42:45.306
I don't know if people
were bribed or threatened...

42:45.341 --> 42:47.675
but the result was that
she suddenly found herself...

42:47.709 --> 42:49.432
with a big acting part...

42:49.469 --> 42:51.738
on a very serious
dramatic radio show...

42:51.773 --> 42:53.431
that was doing Chekhov.

42:53.469 --> 42:55.356
Now here's the payoff
to the story.

42:55.389 --> 42:57.810
The country never
got to hear her act...

42:57.853 --> 43:00.820
because at the last minute,
fate stepped in.

43:00.861 --> 43:02.454
The Japanese have bombed
Pearl Harbor.

43:02.493 --> 43:03.541
Earlier this morning...

43:03.581 --> 43:05.304
a surprise attack
was made on our naval base...

43:05.341 --> 43:07.730
with enormous casualties
to the United States.

43:07.773 --> 43:09.366
We are pre-empting
this show to bring you...

43:09.405 --> 43:10.998
a special report
on the enemy attack...

43:11.037 --> 43:14.234
and a statement from the
President of the United States.

43:15.677 --> 43:17.979
Aren't we gonna do the show?

43:18.013 --> 43:20.216
What do we do?
Come back Monday?

43:20.253 --> 43:22.489
Who is Pearl Harbor?

43:22.525 --> 43:24.118
In one terrible moment...

43:24.157 --> 43:26.426
world events had come between
the listening public...

43:26.461 --> 43:28.184
and Sally White.

43:28.221 --> 43:30.904
And suddenly,
the nation was at war...

43:30.941 --> 43:32.600
and lives changed.

43:32.637 --> 43:36.793
And Sally, like everyone else,
found herself doing her bit.

43:36.829 --> 43:42.328
I don't want to walk without you

43:42.365 --> 43:45.332
Baby

43:47.741 --> 43:52.443
Walk without my arm about you

43:52.477 --> 43:55.859
Baby

43:57.949 --> 43:59.476
I thought

43:59.517 --> 44:03.794
The day you left me behind

44:08.189 --> 44:11.123
I'd take a stroll

44:11.165 --> 44:14.939
And get you right off my mind

44:14.973 --> 44:18.268
But now I find that

44:18.301 --> 44:21.617
I don't want to walk

44:21.661 --> 44:26.713
Without the sunshine

44:28.829 --> 44:31.764
Why'd you have to turn off

44:31.805 --> 44:37.555
All that sunshine?

44:39.133 --> 44:41.020
Oh, baby

44:41.053 --> 44:43.420
Please come back

44:43.453 --> 44:48.723
Or you'll break
my heart for me

44:48.765 --> 44:52.409
'Cause I

44:52.445 --> 44:56.700
Don't want to walk without you

44:56.733 --> 45:03.444
No, sirree

45:11.293 --> 45:12.372
My friends and I...

45:12.413 --> 45:15.380
acting on advice from
the radio G-Man Biff Baxter...

45:15.421 --> 45:18.203
collected scrap iron
every day after school.

45:18.237 --> 45:20.626
Our local soda jerk, Lita,
joined the WACS...

45:20.669 --> 45:22.644
and looked good in uniform.

45:22.685 --> 45:24.692
And Mrs. Riley had
a Victory Garden...

45:24.733 --> 45:26.391
in her flower pots.

45:26.429 --> 45:29.113
On the radio, stories changed...

45:29.149 --> 45:30.872
and now it was
the Japanese and Germans...

45:30.909 --> 45:31.836
who were the villains.

45:31.869 --> 45:33.396
OK, you Axis rats.

45:33.437 --> 45:34.844
I know you've
got submarines...

45:34.877 --> 45:36.438
sneaking around
the coast of America.

45:36.477 --> 45:38.004
We have no submarines.

45:38.045 --> 45:39.027
Yes, you do!

45:39.069 --> 45:40.214
U-boats and airplanes.

45:40.253 --> 45:41.267
But we Americans are...

45:41.309 --> 45:42.999
always on the lookout,
always alert.

45:43.037 --> 45:43.985
Take that!

45:47.677 --> 45:49.749
OK. I think you've
learned your lesson.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.993
One American with courage
is worth 20 of you.

45:52.029 --> 45:52.956
Come along.

45:52.989 --> 45:56.022
Uncle Sam knows what
to do with Axis rats.

45:56.061 --> 45:59.060
My friends and I hung on
Biff Baxter's every word...

45:59.101 --> 46:00.726
and when he said
to keep a sharp eye out...

46:00.765 --> 46:04.026
for enemy planes and submarines
lurking off the coast...

46:04.061 --> 46:06.908
our parents laughed,
but we took it seriously.

46:06.941 --> 46:08.370
Remember, if we see
any German planes...

46:08.413 --> 46:10.136
I do have a number to call, OK?

46:11.261 --> 46:12.952
Aw, look at that.

46:12.989 --> 46:14.330
Hey, look. There's one.

46:14.365 --> 46:16.405
No. No. That's one of ours.

46:16.445 --> 46:17.372
You sure?

46:17.405 --> 46:20.023
I don't think the Germans
can get over here so easy.

46:20.061 --> 46:20.988
They can!

46:21.021 --> 46:23.257
The Masked Avenger says
they're working on rockets.

46:23.293 --> 46:25.081
Hey, look! There's
a Japanese bomber!

46:25.117 --> 46:27.255
- Let me see!
- Get off!

46:27.293 --> 46:30.140
Hey, wow! Look in that window!

46:36.189 --> 46:38.098
Let me see! Let me see!

46:38.141 --> 46:39.451
What do you see?

46:39.485 --> 46:41.722
Jesus! What legs!

46:42.557 --> 46:43.767
Hey, it's my turn.

46:57.565 --> 46:58.939
Hey, hand 'em over.
What do you see?

47:07.837 --> 47:10.619
Oh, God, I can hardly breathe!

47:27.069 --> 47:28.313
Later that afternoon...

47:28.349 --> 47:30.618
we all walked down
to the water's edge...

47:30.653 --> 47:32.954
and the talk had
shifted away from Nazis...

47:32.989 --> 47:34.265
to more important matters.

47:34.301 --> 47:35.479
Boy, she was pretty.

47:35.517 --> 47:37.143
Nah, she was nothin' special.

47:37.181 --> 47:38.610
She was all right...

47:38.653 --> 47:40.563
but my favorite
is Rita Hayworth.

47:40.605 --> 47:42.012
I like Betty Grable.

47:42.045 --> 47:43.572
I like Dana Andrews.

47:43.613 --> 47:45.435
Are you kidding?
Dana Andrews is a man.

47:45.469 --> 47:46.417
She is?

47:46.461 --> 47:48.403
Yeah. Didn't you ever
see "Crash Dive"?

47:48.445 --> 47:50.005
With a name like Dana?

47:50.941 --> 47:53.046
Say, guys, want to look
for planes or something?

47:53.085 --> 47:54.230
I'm going home.

47:54.269 --> 47:56.211
Yeah. I'll come with you.
Let's go listen to the radio.

48:00.893 --> 48:02.715
I didn't care if
the guys went home.

48:03.357 --> 48:05.266
I was in a funny mood
that afternoon.

48:06.141 --> 48:08.891
I just stood there,
looking out at the Atlantic.

48:09.661 --> 48:12.661
My mind was thinking
about life and women...

48:12.701 --> 48:14.195
and a million different things.

48:15.261 --> 48:18.010
And then, suddenly, I saw it.

48:18.941 --> 48:21.941
It was just like Biff Baxter
described it.

48:21.981 --> 48:25.526
It came up and went under
so mysteriously and silently...

48:25.565 --> 48:27.125
that I couldn't believe my eyes.

48:28.253 --> 48:30.740
I never told anyone
about it afterward...

48:30.781 --> 48:32.788
because I doubted
my own experience.

48:34.141 --> 48:36.923
Besides, I knew that
no one would believe me.

48:38.173 --> 48:41.020
No one except Biff Baxter.

48:49.789 --> 48:53.172
They're either
too young or too old

48:53.885 --> 48:57.878
They're either too gray
or too grassy green

48:57.917 --> 49:01.779
The pickin's are poor
and the crop is lean

49:01.821 --> 49:03.828
What's good is in the army

49:03.869 --> 49:06.007
What's left will never harm me

49:06.045 --> 49:09.842
They're either
too old or too young

49:09.885 --> 49:13.943
So, darling,
you'll never get stung

49:13.981 --> 49:18.007
Tomorrow, I'll go hiking
with that Eagle Scout unless

49:18.045 --> 49:20.249
I get a call from Grandpa

49:20.285 --> 49:23.481
For a snappy game of chess

49:23.517 --> 49:25.306
I've looked the field over...

49:25.341 --> 49:26.289
What are you doin'?

49:27.133 --> 49:30.646
I'm out of nylons, but lots
of girls paint them on now.

49:30.685 --> 49:31.962
Better hope it doesn't rain.

49:31.997 --> 49:33.175
Oh, right!

49:33.821 --> 49:35.829
Oh, Tess, I really think
this could be the one.

49:35.869 --> 49:37.298
I hope so.

49:37.341 --> 49:39.545
He's so good-looking,
and he's good-natured...

49:39.581 --> 49:40.956
and he has his own business...

49:40.989 --> 49:42.997
and his fiancee
died last year...

49:43.037 --> 49:44.979
so he's obviously
marriage-minded.

49:45.021 --> 49:47.094
How come he's not in the army?

49:47.133 --> 49:48.856
- He has flat feet.
- Oh.

49:48.893 --> 49:50.038
But that's his only drawback.

49:50.077 --> 49:51.005
Oh, you really think...

49:51.037 --> 49:53.558
you could love a man
with fallen arches, huh?

49:53.597 --> 49:55.572
I know. You think
I'm too demanding.

49:55.613 --> 49:58.613
I do. I think you have these
qualities that you demand...

49:58.653 --> 49:59.929
and when you meet a nice man...

49:59.965 --> 50:02.070
you disqualify him
for the smallest fault.

50:02.109 --> 50:03.058
That's not true.

50:03.101 --> 50:05.272
So, what was wrong
with Nat Bernstein?

50:05.309 --> 50:07.676
He wore white socks
with a tuxedo.

50:07.709 --> 50:09.848
That's not a good enough reason.

50:09.885 --> 50:11.543
And then, when you fall
in love with somebody...

50:11.581 --> 50:13.752
there is always
something wrong with him.

50:13.789 --> 50:16.026
Yeah. Well, they all seem fine.

50:16.061 --> 50:17.272
I don't know.

50:17.309 --> 50:20.091
You've got this sixth
sense for picking losers.

50:20.125 --> 50:21.052
Sometimes I wonder...

50:21.085 --> 50:23.190
do you really want
to get married?

50:23.229 --> 50:24.723
More than anything!

50:24.765 --> 50:26.074
Don't you think
I want to have a child...

50:26.109 --> 50:27.636
before it's too late?

50:27.677 --> 50:29.466
God, how I envy you.

50:29.501 --> 50:31.127
I just want it to be perfect.

50:31.165 --> 50:32.572
Well, it's never perfect.

50:32.605 --> 50:34.547
If you wait for perfect,
you don't get pregnant.

50:34.589 --> 50:36.760
You wind up with your teeth
in a glass of water.

50:36.797 --> 50:39.415
Easy for you to say.

50:40.221 --> 50:42.871
I compromised when
I picked Martin.

50:42.909 --> 50:46.225
I mean, I wanted someone
tall and handsome and rich.

50:47.037 --> 50:48.598
Three out of three
I gave up.

50:48.637 --> 50:51.026
Well, I think you did
right to compromise.

50:51.069 --> 50:54.069
Why? You don't think I could
have done better than Martin?

50:54.109 --> 50:56.630
I know. You could have
married Sam Slotkin.

50:56.669 --> 50:57.879
So, why didn't you?

50:57.917 --> 50:59.804
Well, Sam Slotkin
was a mortician.

50:59.837 --> 51:01.724
He always smelled
from formaldehyde.

51:02.653 --> 51:04.409
And don't think that
Martin didn't compromise...

51:04.445 --> 51:05.787
when he picked me.

51:05.821 --> 51:08.821
I mean, he always dreamed
of being a business tycoon,

51:08.861 --> 51:11.480
having a beautiful, blond wife.

51:11.517 --> 51:15.259
I tell him the day he becomes
a tycoon, I'll dye my hair.

51:15.293 --> 51:17.081
Well, at least
you have each other.

51:17.117 --> 51:19.092
That's all I want--someone.

51:19.133 --> 51:21.784
So, you have to lower
your standards a little.

51:22.621 --> 51:26.166
You know, marrying for
love is a very recent idea.

51:26.205 --> 51:27.579
In the old country,
with Mom and Pop...

51:27.613 --> 51:29.042
they didn't marry for love.

51:29.085 --> 51:31.932
A man married a woman
because he needed an extra mule.

51:34.205 --> 51:35.547
Yeah, but meantime,
you're the one that listens...

51:35.581 --> 51:37.753
to all the romantic
soap operas on the radio.

51:37.789 --> 51:39.829
Yeah, well, I like to daydream.

51:39.869 --> 51:42.836
But I have my two feet
firmly planted on my husband.

51:44.573 --> 51:47.061
First we're gonna go to the
movie, then we'll go to eat...

51:47.101 --> 51:48.508
and maybe I'll ask
him back here...

51:48.541 --> 51:51.029
although I don't want to seem
too forward on the first date.

51:51.069 --> 51:53.011
You really like this guy, huh?

51:53.053 --> 51:55.355
Oh, I like him so much.

51:55.389 --> 51:57.178
Well, we'll say
a prayer for you...

51:57.213 --> 52:00.345
and then, maybe this time
next year, you'll look like me.

52:06.621 --> 52:07.798
Hey, you know what
I was thinkin', Tess?

52:07.837 --> 52:08.764
What?

52:08.797 --> 52:10.258
If I could learn engraving
and buy a machine.

52:10.301 --> 52:11.960
Not another "get rich" scheme.

52:11.997 --> 52:14.168
I could make a few dollars
engraving, let me tell you.

52:14.205 --> 52:15.765
Hey. Now, let me tell
you the beauty part.

52:15.805 --> 52:16.950
Yeah? I'm waiting.

52:16.989 --> 52:19.356
When you engrave gold rings
and lockets, you know...

52:19.389 --> 52:20.698
what you cut out
when you make the letters...

52:20.733 --> 52:22.675
falls down on the table
and accumulates.

52:22.717 --> 52:24.375
- It's gold dust.
- Forget it, will you?

52:24.413 --> 52:25.722
It'll be like all
the other ideas.

52:25.757 --> 52:28.146
Gold dust, Tess,
and the engraver owns it!

52:28.189 --> 52:29.204
Hold my wool.

52:30.301 --> 52:32.473
If it's a girl, I thought
we could name it Lola.

52:32.509 --> 52:33.916
Lola? What do you want
her to be, a stripper?

52:33.949 --> 52:35.324
And if it's a boy, Lionel?

52:35.357 --> 52:37.113
No son of mine is
gonna be named Lionel.

52:37.149 --> 52:38.937
I want an "L" name
after my Uncle Louie.

52:38.973 --> 52:40.729
Oh, your Uncle Louie.
How about louse?

52:41.565 --> 52:43.605
The news is not good tonight.

52:43.645 --> 52:45.468
Reports are that
Nazi tank divisions...

52:45.501 --> 52:47.890
are pushing American
infantrymen back...

52:47.933 --> 52:50.006
in furious armored warfare.

52:50.045 --> 52:53.144
Meanwhile, on the second front,
Japanese have taken control...

52:53.181 --> 52:54.675
of two more islands
in the Philippines...

52:54.717 --> 52:56.605
and are advancing on American...

52:58.493 --> 53:01.341
This is John Jenkins,
broadcasting from London...

53:01.373 --> 53:03.926
and the bombs are falling
even as we speak.

53:05.917 --> 53:08.765
And the morale of the boys
is good here in Guadalcanal...

53:08.797 --> 53:10.171
despite heavy losses.

53:13.789 --> 53:14.716
What do you think, Martin?

53:14.749 --> 53:16.756
You think Hitler's gonna win?

53:16.797 --> 53:18.456
Sometimes I wonder
about the wisdom...

53:18.493 --> 53:20.730
of bringing new life into
the world, I'll tell you that.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.770
Come on. Lights out.
It's blackout.

53:23.805 --> 53:25.944
Oh, God.
Another air raid drill.

53:25.981 --> 53:29.047
Between the Nazis and the
Communists, give me those Reds.

53:29.085 --> 53:30.972
Stick to your fish.

53:31.005 --> 53:32.663
What do they want, those Nazis--

53:32.701 --> 53:34.611
to slaughter everyone
on the planet?

53:34.653 --> 53:35.831
The Nazis, the Communists.

53:35.869 --> 53:37.724
The world would be better off
without any of them, believe me.

53:37.757 --> 53:40.474
Come here. You know what
W.C. Fields said, don't you?

53:41.277 --> 53:42.225
He said, to settle a war...

53:42.269 --> 53:43.545
the leaders of
the countries involved...

53:43.581 --> 53:45.271
should meet in a stadium
and fight it out...

53:45.309 --> 53:47.000
with socks filled
with horse manure.

54:01.565 --> 54:02.841
Hey! Put that light out!

54:07.709 --> 54:09.880
Maybe you should wake him up
to see the searchlights.

54:09.917 --> 54:12.219
No, no. Let him sleep.
He's got school.

54:13.405 --> 54:14.899
So beautiful.

54:16.541 --> 54:17.817
Wow, what a world.

54:19.037 --> 54:21.852
It could be so wonderful if
it wasn't for certain people.

54:27.453 --> 54:29.874
Later that night,
I was awakened...

54:29.917 --> 54:31.957
by the sound
of our radio in the kitchen.

54:48.925 --> 54:50.681
I had a very nice time.

54:50.717 --> 54:52.212
Yes. It was wonderful.

54:56.285 --> 54:58.107
It was such a clear night out.

54:58.141 --> 54:59.930
You could see all the stars.

55:03.869 --> 55:05.276
I think I should be going.

55:05.309 --> 55:06.869
Oh, don't go. It's not late.

55:06.909 --> 55:09.243
Well, I have to drive
back to the Bronx.

55:09.277 --> 55:13.303
Fred, you must know I have
a little crush on you.

55:14.301 --> 55:15.479
Please, Bea.

55:16.253 --> 55:17.398
What is it?

55:17.437 --> 55:18.964
What's wrong?

55:19.005 --> 55:20.347
Nothing. It's just I...

55:25.405 --> 55:26.583
What's wrong?

55:27.869 --> 55:30.236
Is it still your fiancee?

55:32.285 --> 55:34.456
It's been such a long
period of grief.

55:34.493 --> 55:35.769
It's not fair to you.

55:36.605 --> 55:38.165
I know. I know.

55:38.205 --> 55:41.107
It's just that every time
I hear that song on the radio...

55:41.149 --> 55:43.353
my memory goes back to Leonard.

55:43.389 --> 55:44.883
That was our song.

55:46.877 --> 55:47.825
Leonard?

55:50.813 --> 55:51.990
My beloved.

55:54.237 --> 55:56.539
You never said your
fiance's name was Leonard.

55:56.573 --> 55:57.587
How could I?

56:10.141 --> 56:11.090
I see.

56:15.741 --> 56:17.083
Just calm yourself.

56:17.117 --> 56:18.906
Would you like a drink?

56:18.941 --> 56:19.923
No.

56:27.709 --> 56:28.854
Just relax.

56:35.453 --> 56:36.664
It's a nice song.

56:48.541 --> 56:49.469
You guys, shut up!

56:49.501 --> 56:51.192
The principal's coming!

56:51.229 --> 56:52.178
Sit down!

56:56.349 --> 56:57.942
Good morning, class.

56:58.813 --> 56:59.761
I'd like you to know...

56:59.805 --> 57:03.580
that your regular teacher,
Mrs. Nash, is ill today...

57:03.613 --> 57:06.002
and you will have
a substitute teacher.

57:08.189 --> 57:11.124
Now, now. Children.
Children, please.

57:11.165 --> 57:13.653
Be quiet. No noise.

57:13.693 --> 57:15.100
I want you to be
very good today.

57:15.133 --> 57:17.816
I want you to be on
your very best behavior.

57:18.877 --> 57:21.113
Miss Gordon,
would you please come in?

57:25.757 --> 57:26.869
They're all yours.

57:34.909 --> 57:35.770
OK, class.

57:35.805 --> 57:37.365
We're going to
begin today--

57:37.405 --> 57:39.991
Well, first, let me tell
you what my name is.

57:40.029 --> 57:41.306
I'm Miss Gordon.

57:45.693 --> 57:48.825
Oh, God, we're all
going straight to hell.

57:50.077 --> 57:51.899
I conclude
the Miss Gordon episode...

57:51.933 --> 57:54.038
with just one observation:

57:54.077 --> 57:56.019
for some miraculous reason...

57:56.061 --> 57:58.297
it's a wonderful feeling
having a schoolteacher...

57:58.333 --> 58:01.202
you've seen dance naked
in front of a mirror...

58:01.245 --> 58:02.707
but that's how it happened.

58:05.693 --> 58:08.508
Now, I want to take a minute to
tell you how Sally wound up...

58:08.541 --> 58:11.290
because it's one of
the radio legends of the time.

58:12.189 --> 58:14.556
Get regular with Re-Lax

58:15.229 --> 58:17.946
Start every day the Re-Lax way

58:17.981 --> 58:20.120
Your system will feel so great

58:20.157 --> 58:23.802
You'll want to relax on
the top of the Empire State

58:23.837 --> 58:26.172
Get regular with Re-Lax

58:26.845 --> 58:29.911
Start every day the Re-Lax way

58:29.949 --> 58:32.502
When your tummy's not so hot

58:33.181 --> 58:35.418
Remember, "X" marks the spot

58:35.453 --> 58:38.268
Get regular with Re-Lax

58:38.301 --> 58:40.951
The Re-Lax way

58:42.269 --> 58:44.091
No, no. More feeling!

58:44.125 --> 58:45.467
It has no inner life.

58:45.501 --> 58:47.192
We need the name
of the product...

58:47.229 --> 58:49.401
to be enunciated
a little more clearly.

58:49.437 --> 58:50.964
Please, I'll deal
with the performers.

58:51.005 --> 58:53.242
And let's cut the phrase
"X marks the spot"...

58:53.277 --> 58:54.870
because people will be
reminded of Ex-Lax.

58:54.909 --> 58:56.054
You're being too touchy.

58:56.093 --> 58:57.467
Why take the chance?

58:57.501 --> 58:59.224
Let's run it again, Sally.

58:59.261 --> 59:00.210
Three, four...

59:01.085 --> 59:03.419
Get regular with Re-Lax

59:04.253 --> 59:06.806
Start every day the Re-Lax way

59:06.845 --> 59:07.772
- Your system...
- No! No!

59:07.805 --> 59:10.194
Will feel so great,
you'll want...

59:10.909 --> 59:11.836
Like this:

59:11.869 --> 59:14.422
Re-Lax, Re-Lax

59:14.461 --> 59:18.455
Well, what should
I be thinking inside?

59:18.493 --> 59:19.703
Think laxative.

59:19.741 --> 59:22.042
Think soothing relief.

59:22.077 --> 59:23.539
Please. I'll give
her a motivation.

59:23.581 --> 59:26.036
Laxative, darling.
You crave one.

59:26.077 --> 59:27.386
Try again.

59:27.421 --> 59:28.369
Three, four...

59:29.277 --> 59:31.612
Get regular with Re-Lax

59:32.381 --> 59:35.098
Start every day the Re-Lax way

59:35.133 --> 59:37.272
Your system will feel so great

59:37.309 --> 59:41.019
You'll want to relax on
the top of the Empire State...

59:41.053 --> 59:43.508
It's not the commercial,
it's the girl.

59:43.549 --> 59:44.694
She has no flair for it.

59:44.733 --> 59:46.228
She's the best who auditioned.

59:46.269 --> 59:48.276
What do you think, Mr. Monroe?

59:48.317 --> 59:50.772
I think she's correct
to represent my laxative.

59:50.813 --> 59:52.668
She's fresh.
Her voice is natural...

59:52.701 --> 59:53.945
and she does it simply.

59:55.901 --> 59:56.829
What do you think, Doris?

59:56.861 --> 59:58.138
I don't like her.

59:59.197 --> 01:00:00.342
Get rid of her.

01:00:01.117 --> 01:00:02.873
Sally hung around
the Broadway area...

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:04.851
and tried to break
into broadcasting...

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.803
but the only roles she ever
seemed to wind up with...

01:00:06.845 --> 01:00:08.122
were in the bedroom.

01:00:08.157 --> 01:00:10.645
Then one day, as she would
later tell her biographer...

01:00:10.685 --> 01:00:13.271
the voice of God told her
to take diction lessons...

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:15.218
and her whole life changed.

01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:18.614
Hark! I hear the cannons roar.

01:00:18.653 --> 01:00:20.060
Is it the king approaching?

01:00:20.957 --> 01:00:23.740
Hark! I hear the cannons roar.

01:00:23.773 --> 01:00:26.140
Is it the king approaching?

01:00:26.173 --> 01:00:28.594
Hark! I hear the cannons roar.

01:00:28.637 --> 01:00:30.939
Is it the king approaching?

01:00:30.973 --> 01:00:34.486
Hark. I hear the cannons roar.

01:00:34.525 --> 01:00:36.281
Is it the king approaching?

01:00:36.317 --> 01:00:37.659
No, no, no.

01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:39.449
The cannons roar.

01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:55.385
Sally practiced faithfully
every day for many months.

01:00:55.421 --> 01:00:58.356
Her natural speech was
a great obstacle to get over...

01:00:58.397 --> 01:01:00.699
yet through diligence
and perseverance...

01:01:00.733 --> 01:01:02.936
plus a rather special
intimate knowledge...

01:01:02.973 --> 01:01:04.980
of many Broadway
personalities...

01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:06.876
it was only
a question of time...

01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:10.684
before she emerged
a full-blown star.

01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:17.336
And now, the makers of
Lady Lydia facial cream...

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:20.886
bring you "Sally White
and Her Gay White Way."

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:24.274
Good evening, and cheers
to you all out there.

01:01:24.317 --> 01:01:26.357
My first exclusive--

01:01:26.397 --> 01:01:29.529
Clark Gable was in town
this week in uniform...

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.743
and where did he go?

01:01:30.781 --> 01:01:33.148
To El Morocco, naturally.

01:01:33.181 --> 01:01:34.555
That brunette on his arm...

01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:37.884
was Lolly Hayes,
an up-and-coming starlet.

01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:40.121
Hope you had fun, Clark.

01:01:40.157 --> 01:01:43.834
And didn't Rita Hayworth
look stunning last night...

01:01:43.869 --> 01:01:45.625
at the Copacabana?

01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:47.701
Oh, Abe, how come
you never take me...

01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:49.334
to the Copacabana
or El Morocco?

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:50.650
Take the gas pipe.

01:01:50.685 --> 01:01:51.830
I suppose you
would have been happier...

01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:53.210
married to Rita Hayworth.

01:01:53.245 --> 01:01:54.390
You gotta ask?

01:01:54.429 --> 01:01:56.317
Believe me, Abe, those
show business celebrities...

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:59.481
get divorced every 6 weeks,
but we're together forever.

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.619
I may take the gas pipe.

01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:04.050
Just once, I'd like to
eat at the Stork Club.

01:02:04.093 --> 01:02:05.686
They don't take Jews
in the Stork Club.

01:02:05.725 --> 01:02:07.132
No Jews, no colored.

01:02:07.165 --> 01:02:09.304
Abe, this is
the United States of America.

01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:12.505
Now here, try taking
Minnie's maid Cleopatra...

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:14.581
to the Stork Club.
You'd get curb service.

01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:16.209
Damn.

01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:19.479
Don't hit it, Abe,
you'll break it.

01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:21.011
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:24.413 --> 01:02:26.235
Naturally, he did break it.

01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:27.480
He sent it out to be repaired...

01:02:27.517 --> 01:02:30.484
and a week later,
I was sent to pick it up.

01:02:30.525 --> 01:02:32.696
My parents told me that
since it was so heavy...

01:02:32.733 --> 01:02:36.410
I could take it home by taxi,
but I had a brilliant plan.

01:02:36.445 --> 01:02:39.412
I figured if I carried it,
I could keep the cab fare.

01:02:43.613 --> 01:02:46.198
The first half-mile
was barely manageable.

01:02:46.237 --> 01:02:48.658
Pretty soon, I realized
I was gonna have to give in...

01:02:48.701 --> 01:02:50.774
and that I was not
gonna save any money.

01:03:03.645 --> 01:03:04.594
Hi.

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:06.580
You?

01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:12.664
I'm helping out
a friend, you know.

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:13.781
Come on. Get in.

01:03:15.997 --> 01:03:18.714
That's how I found out
what my father did for a living.

01:03:18.749 --> 01:03:21.367
For some strange reason,
he was ashamed of it...

01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:23.292
and even then,
he didn't admit it.

01:03:23.325 --> 01:03:25.081
It didn't bother me
one bit, though.

01:03:25.117 --> 01:03:26.394
I loved him.

01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:29.211
In fact, I gave him
the biggest tip he got all day.

01:03:31.965 --> 01:03:34.682
Chimson's coffee is
having a slogan contest.

01:03:34.717 --> 01:03:36.211
You write it in
to their radio show...

01:03:36.253 --> 01:03:37.430
and you win a refrigerator.

01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:38.745
That fraud!

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.374
What's a good slogan?

01:03:40.413 --> 01:03:41.591
Wait a minute,
wait a minute. I got one.

01:03:41.629 --> 01:03:43.036
How about,
"A coffee with oomph!"

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.052
That's terrible.

01:03:44.093 --> 01:03:46.100
Oh, yeah? What's
your idea, big shot?

01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:47.767
"Good to the last drop"?

01:03:47.805 --> 01:03:49.660
That's Maxwell House.
Come on.

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:50.903
I knew I'd heard it.

01:03:50.941 --> 01:03:54.519
"It won't keep you awake,
it will keep you happy."

01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:56.150
Hey, that's not bad.

01:03:56.189 --> 01:03:57.117
It's catchy, right?

01:03:57.149 --> 01:03:58.077
Yeah.

01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:59.037
- Ooh!
- What? What?

01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.997
It's happening!

01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:01.458
Hey, Ceil. All right.
Easy, easy, easy.

01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:02.429
This is really it.

01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:03.890
Now, put your arm around me.

01:04:03.933 --> 01:04:05.210
I am so ready for this.

01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:06.489
Put your arm around me.
All right.

01:04:06.525 --> 01:04:08.467
Nice and easy. Ceil, this is it.

01:04:08.509 --> 01:04:10.931
This is it. I'm so excited!
A baby! I can't wait!

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:11.900
I want a girl.

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:13.362
Take it easy.
You should get a girl.

01:04:13.405 --> 01:04:14.779
Oh, you should
get a girl. No problem.

01:04:14.813 --> 01:04:16.569
Abe, isn't this wonderful?
You want to have a baby?

01:04:16.605 --> 01:04:19.507
Slow, slow, slow.

01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:20.477
You got the bags?

01:04:20.509 --> 01:04:22.681
Suitcases. Yeah.

01:04:22.717 --> 01:04:23.830
Nice and slow.

01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:24.817
Here you go, honey.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:25.788
You did a good job.

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:26.748
Aw!

01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:27.729
Yeah, she did a good job.

01:04:27.773 --> 01:04:28.701
You did a good job, too, Martin.

01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:30.294
I did a great job.
It was very difficult.

01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:37.331
Tess, you haven't met Sy yet.

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.355
Oh, pleased to meet you, Sy.

01:04:38.397 --> 01:04:40.405
My pleasure. Congratulations.

01:04:40.445 --> 01:04:42.103
Oh, and this is
my brother-in-law Abe.

01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:43.068
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:04:43.101 --> 01:04:44.028
And Ceil.

01:04:44.061 --> 01:04:44.988
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:04:45.021 --> 01:04:46.133
So, we better be going.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:48.181
We're gonna take your son
into Manhattan for the day.

01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:50.076
Oh, great. Lucky boy.

01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:53.208
Sy has a new car,
and we'll do some driving.

01:04:53.245 --> 01:04:54.194
Don't lose him, all right?

01:04:54.237 --> 01:04:56.059
No, we won't lose him.

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:57.849
I'll be good. Don't worry.

01:04:57.885 --> 01:04:58.813
Have a good time.

01:04:58.845 --> 01:04:59.794
- Thanks.
- It's nice of you.

01:04:59.837 --> 01:05:00.764
- Thanks a lot.
- Ok. I'll see you soon.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:02.258
Don't give them any
trouble, all right?

01:05:02.301 --> 01:05:03.511
I'm not going to
give them any trouble.

01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:04.727
- Bye.
- Drive carefully.

01:05:04.765 --> 01:05:05.693
Have a good time.

01:05:05.725 --> 01:05:07.154
- That's very nice.
- Bye.

01:05:07.197 --> 01:05:09.914
Bye, Sy.

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.159
Nice. Nice looking.

01:05:11.197 --> 01:05:12.953
He's not bad. I like him.

01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:15.956
Why is she wasting
her time with him?

01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.142
He's married.

01:05:17.181 --> 01:05:18.163
Really, Ceil?

01:05:18.205 --> 01:05:19.612
He's supposed to be
getting out of it...

01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:21.532
but you know how tight
some women hold on.

01:05:21.565 --> 01:05:23.256
No. Tell me about it.

01:05:23.293 --> 01:05:25.203
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

01:05:25.245 --> 01:05:26.554
She'll be all right.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.589
Martin, are you sure you want
to call the baby Ellen?

01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:30.971
Sure. Sure. Why not?

01:05:31.005 --> 01:05:32.249
It's in memory
of your cousin Eddie.

01:05:32.285 --> 01:05:34.227
In memory? He's not dead yet.

01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:35.414
He should be.

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.427
Oh, Martin, you and your jokes.

01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:03.511
Aunt Bea and her boyfriend...

01:06:03.549 --> 01:06:05.970
gave me one of
the best days I ever had.

01:06:06.013 --> 01:06:08.151
They took me
to my first radio show...

01:06:08.189 --> 01:06:09.749
and if that wasn't
thrill enough...

01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:12.244
Aunt Bea was chosen
as a contestant.

01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:13.910
You're from Rockaway, huh?

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:15.443
Yes.

01:06:15.485 --> 01:06:16.914
And what do you do, Bea?

01:06:16.957 --> 01:06:18.364
I'm a bookkeeper.

01:06:18.397 --> 01:06:21.211
Oh. For a minute, I thought
you said beekeeper.

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:22.772
I'd hate to get stung.

01:06:25.437 --> 01:06:28.372
Now, you chose as
your topic "fish."

01:06:30.077 --> 01:06:31.865
How'd you get
to know about fish?

01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:33.941
Well, my brother-in-law
brings home fish...

01:06:33.981 --> 01:06:35.672
from Sheepshead Bay
all the time...

01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:37.400
and we all help with them,
and after a while...

01:06:37.437 --> 01:06:38.964
you get to identify them, and--

01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:41.044
Oh, that's great. I get it.

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:43.289
Well, now, can you
tell me what this is?

01:06:43.325 --> 01:06:45.147
Aunt Bea had no trouble.

01:06:45.181 --> 01:06:47.636
Years of living in the same
house with Uncle Abe...

01:06:47.677 --> 01:06:50.394
had turned us all
into ichthyologists.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:52.884
And finally, how about this one?

01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:55.064
That's a flounder.

01:06:55.101 --> 01:06:56.148
No, no, no.

01:06:56.189 --> 01:06:57.879
That's a fluke.

01:06:57.917 --> 01:06:58.865
You're sure?

01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:01.084
That's a fluke.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.579
Well, this is no fluke.

01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:05.304
You've won 50 silver dollars.

01:07:15.485 --> 01:07:17.874
Boy, a chemistry set.
I can't believe it.

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:19.029
I've always wanted
one of these.

01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:20.182
This is so great.

01:07:20.221 --> 01:07:21.782
God, I can't wait
to get home and open this.

01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:23.228
Oh, this is fantastic.

01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.887
Bea.

01:07:24.925 --> 01:07:26.649
It was a lovely afternoon.

01:07:26.685 --> 01:07:27.732
A lovely afternoon.

01:07:27.773 --> 01:07:29.529
Gosh, I almost forgot
what a fluke looked like.

01:07:29.565 --> 01:07:31.507
It's a good thing I remembered.

01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:32.532
Well, this time next week...

01:07:32.573 --> 01:07:34.482
we won't have anything
hanging over our heads.

01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:37.621
I'll be free
of all my obligations.

01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:39.123
Are you sure, Sy?

01:07:39.165 --> 01:07:41.140
I've only stayed
because of the children.

01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:44.728
I'm telling you,
Bea, mark my words.

01:07:44.765 --> 01:07:47.482
This time next week,
I'll be a free man.

01:07:47.517 --> 01:07:49.656
And the most expensive one
in the store, too.

01:07:49.693 --> 01:07:51.318
I can't believe this.

01:07:51.357 --> 01:07:53.113
So what are we gonna do
with the rest of the money?

01:07:55.837 --> 01:07:58.041
What Aunt Bea did with
the rest of the money...

01:07:58.077 --> 01:08:00.598
was treat us all to
a Broadway dance palace.

01:08:01.341 --> 01:08:05.716
She and Sy seemed very much
in love, and she seemed happy.

01:08:05.757 --> 01:08:09.019
But it was not to be
because after a week...

01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:11.835
Sy did not leave
his wife and children...

01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:14.171
nor did he
after two weeks nor ever.

01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:17.240
And as the year
came to a close...

01:08:17.277 --> 01:08:19.993
Aunt Bea would soon be
back to her old dreams...

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.298
of finding a true love.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.977
Still, on this night,
no one had any thoughts...

01:08:26.013 --> 01:08:28.729
except what a wonderful time
we were all having.

01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:57.624
Aah! Ohh! Oh, my God!

01:08:57.661 --> 01:08:59.569
Did you do this? I'll kill you.

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:01.140
When I catch you,
I'm gonna kill you!

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.036
Come here! Don't you
run away from me!

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:03.996
What happened?

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:05.720
Look what he did
to my good coat.

01:09:06.429 --> 01:09:07.357
What?

01:09:07.389 --> 01:09:08.337
Bea bought him
a chemistry set.

01:09:08.381 --> 01:09:09.308
He made purple dye and--

01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:10.268
Wait a minute.
That's the coat...

01:09:10.301 --> 01:09:11.675
I gave you for
an anniversary present?

01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:12.636
Look at it!

01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:13.595
No, you don't hit him.
I'll hit him.

01:09:13.629 --> 01:09:14.643
I can hit him,
I can hit him!

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:16.856
You're too easy with him.
I know how to hit him.

01:09:16.893 --> 01:09:19.314
Abe, have you seen Mama's teeth?

01:09:19.357 --> 01:09:21.015
She left them in a glass
of water yesterday...

01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:22.263
and she can't find them.

01:09:23.037 --> 01:09:24.924
The kids were playing
hockey with them.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:26.866
They were playing hockey
with Mama's teeth?

01:09:26.908 --> 01:09:28.916
Yeah. They're about
the same size as a puck.

01:09:30.845 --> 01:09:33.812
Oh, listen!
Isn't that the conga?

01:09:33.853 --> 01:09:35.063
Oh, my teacher said
you could meet...

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.206
very interesting men
in a conga line.

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:41.462
Come on, Ruthie! Come on, Ceil!

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:43.770
I can do this,
I can do this!

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.462
One, two, three!

01:09:46.589 --> 01:09:50.844
Come here! Hey, you're making
it worse on yourself.

01:09:50.877 --> 01:09:51.825
Come here!

01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.894
Can you really
meet men doing this?

01:09:57.085 --> 01:09:58.427
Come here!
I got you! Come here!

01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:01.210
You're gonna
pay for it this time.

01:10:06.973 --> 01:10:07.987
We interrupt this program...

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:09.972
to bring you
a special news bulletin.

01:10:10.013 --> 01:10:11.289
Emergency workers
and laborers...

01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:13.463
outside Strasberg,
Pennsylvania...

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.835
are working diligently
to locate and remove...

01:10:15.869 --> 01:10:19.382
an 8-year-old girl
who has fallen down a well.

01:10:19.421 --> 01:10:22.650
Polly Phelps fell down the well
while playing with friends...

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:25.652
and has been lodged at
the bottom since 12 noon.

01:10:25.693 --> 01:10:28.181
Reports will be coming
to you live on the spot...

01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.555
where this tense drama
is unfolding.

01:10:30.589 --> 01:10:32.760
We don't know if
the girl is still living...

01:10:32.797 --> 01:10:34.553
although authorities
are predicting...

01:10:34.589 --> 01:10:37.109
they will rescue the child
within moments.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:41.018
It has been 7 hours, and still
emergency workers have not...

01:10:41.053 --> 01:10:44.436
been able to contact or free
8-year-old Polly Phelps.

01:10:44.477 --> 01:10:46.517
Attempts to go down
into the well...

01:10:54.269 --> 01:10:56.854
Can you hear me? Polly!

01:10:56.893 --> 01:10:58.715
Can you hear anything?

01:10:58.749 --> 01:11:00.243
Get the press back!

01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:07.385
Polly, honey! We're coming
for you, just hold on!

01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:08.883
Be careful with that thing!

01:11:14.749 --> 01:11:17.466
Meanwhile, members of the press
are out here in abundance.

01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:20.535
And this field is illuminated
by the eerie incandescence...

01:11:20.573 --> 01:11:23.028
of searchlights
and flash bulbs.

01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:26.582
The anxious parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Phelps, stand by waiting...

01:11:26.621 --> 01:11:29.556
hoping for some word, some sign.

01:11:30.205 --> 01:11:31.928
We'll continue
to broadcast live...

01:11:31.965 --> 01:11:33.012
from the scene of
the accident...

01:11:33.053 --> 01:11:35.606
and bring you details
as they unfold.

01:11:35.645 --> 01:11:38.808
I'm sure all Americans listening
to their radios everywhere...

01:11:38.845 --> 01:11:42.107
are praying for Polly Phelps
and the Phelps family.

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:58.131
Please, God, don't let her die.

01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:03.323
The fire department
and local emergency squads...

01:12:03.357 --> 01:12:05.496
have been on the job
for many hours...

01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:06.875
but the difficulty
seems to be...

01:12:06.909 --> 01:12:10.008
that the well is quite narrow
and the surrounding--

01:12:10.045 --> 01:12:11.354
No, wait, wait!

01:12:12.413 --> 01:12:13.722
It looks like he has something.

01:12:13.757 --> 01:12:15.317
He's tugging the rope.

01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:19.542
They're raising the rope
very, very slowly.

01:12:19.581 --> 01:12:22.232
They seem to be
close to a rescue.

01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:24.925
Police have her. Stand by.

01:12:24.957 --> 01:12:26.648
We're coming to you live.

01:12:28.957 --> 01:12:31.477
Don? Don, is--Don...

01:12:32.605 --> 01:12:34.099
Oh, God, this is terrible.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.189
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:12:36.093 --> 01:12:38.908
The child is not alive.

01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:42.743
Polly Phelps is dead.

01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:46.043
After all the efforts
and prayers...

01:12:46.077 --> 01:12:47.387
the little girl is dead.

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.677
This is tragic.

01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:53.559
Just tragic.

01:12:57.533 --> 01:13:00.435
We are going to end our
broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.

01:13:01.981 --> 01:13:05.527
I know that all America shares
the grief of the Phelps family.

01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:13.273
This has been a sudden,
unexpected human tragedy.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.551
Good evening,
and Happy New Year.

01:13:50.589 --> 01:13:52.531
We're broadcasting live
from the King Cole room...

01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:54.580
in midtown Manhattan,
where everyone is here...

01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:56.596
to welcome in 1944.

01:13:59.933 --> 01:14:01.460
You know, I used
to work in this place.

01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:05.047
Now I'm here with, of all
people, the Masked Avenger.

01:14:05.085 --> 01:14:07.638
Beware, evildoers,
wherever you are!

01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:10.621
Now, where are they
this evening?

01:14:10.653 --> 01:14:13.109
There they are.
Hello, everybody!

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:14.393
Hello, everyone!

01:14:42.973 --> 01:14:43.900
Oh, listen to that.

01:14:43.933 --> 01:14:46.170
Doesn't that sound
wonderful at that nightclub?

01:14:46.205 --> 01:14:48.147
Yeah. Why aren't we there, Abe?

01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:49.782
Why aren't we there?
Because we're here.

01:14:49.821 --> 01:14:50.998
Don't you want
to hit the hot spots...

01:14:51.037 --> 01:14:53.426
and drink champagne
from my slipper?

01:14:53.469 --> 01:14:55.160
I can't take that much liquid.

01:14:55.197 --> 01:14:58.328
Just a minute. And besides,
only creeps and crazy people...

01:14:58.365 --> 01:14:59.292
go out New Year's Eve.

01:14:59.325 --> 01:15:01.463
Then you should
definitely go out, Abe.

01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:04.152
There are those who drink
champagne at nightclubs...

01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:06.906
and us who listen to them
drink champagne on the radio.

01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:09.145
Yeah. I heard "Breakfast
with Irene and Roger"...

01:15:09.181 --> 01:15:10.675
this morning, and they said
they were going...

01:15:10.717 --> 01:15:12.310
to the King Cole room tonight...

01:15:12.349 --> 01:15:14.259
and they said all their
friends would be there.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.156
Roger and Irene are
rich and famous.

01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:17.596
They have a radio show.

01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:19.571
They wear fancy clothes...

01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:21.718
they hobnob with their
celebrity friends...

01:15:21.757 --> 01:15:23.862
they go to all the openings
and nightclubs.

01:15:23.901 --> 01:15:25.210
What, you think they're
happier than us?

01:15:25.245 --> 01:15:27.666
How much time do I have
to answer that question?

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:31.932
You'd be so nice to come home to

01:15:33.245 --> 01:15:38.395
You'd be so nice by the fire

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:43.130
While the breeze on high

01:15:43.165 --> 01:15:47.388
Sings a lullaby

01:15:47.421 --> 01:15:56.662
You'd be all that I could desire

01:15:56.701 --> 01:16:04.120
Under stars chilled
by the winter

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:12.633
Under an August moon
burning above

01:16:14.397 --> 01:16:18.292
You'd be so nice

01:16:19.133 --> 01:16:22.679
You'd be paradise

01:16:22.717 --> 01:16:26.776
To come home to

01:16:26.813 --> 01:16:31.036
And love

01:16:33.533 --> 01:16:34.777
What, no date tonight?

01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:37.367
Well, it's OK.

01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:38.998
We're all together, you know.

01:16:39.037 --> 01:16:43.544
Under stars chilled

01:16:43.581 --> 01:16:46.930
By the winter

01:16:46.973 --> 01:16:51.795
Under an August moon

01:16:53.021 --> 01:17:00.659
Burning above

01:17:02.525 --> 01:17:07.260
You'd be so nice

01:17:08.733 --> 01:17:15.159
You'd be paradise

01:17:17.949 --> 01:17:21.211
To come home to

01:17:22.045 --> 01:17:28.854
And love

01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:35.129
Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:36.989 --> 01:17:38.363
To a wonderful year.

01:17:38.397 --> 01:17:40.088
A Lucky Strike, please.

01:17:40.765 --> 01:17:42.553
Thank you, darling.
Keep the change.

01:17:42.589 --> 01:17:45.622
You know, it's not even
midnight, and I'm drunk.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.766
Anyone ever seen
the roof of this place?

01:17:47.805 --> 01:17:48.754
I beg your pardon?

01:17:49.533 --> 01:17:52.283
It has the most marvelous
view of the city, really.

01:17:52.317 --> 01:17:53.245
How do you know the roof?

01:17:53.277 --> 01:17:55.252
I was up there once
when I worked here.

01:17:55.293 --> 01:17:57.530
The circumstances
were quite different.

01:17:57.565 --> 01:17:59.420
Why don't we go
up there and see it?

01:17:59.453 --> 01:18:02.202
Would you like to?
Come with me.

01:18:02.237 --> 01:18:04.179
Come on. What fun!

01:18:15.741 --> 01:18:18.556
Oh, my goodness!
It's freezing out here.

01:18:26.749 --> 01:18:28.505
This is amazing.

01:18:28.541 --> 01:18:30.364
Amazing, but it's
freezing up here.

01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:31.891
What a crazy idea.

01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:34.996
What were you doing up here?

01:18:35.037 --> 01:18:37.306
Oh, it's a long story.

01:18:38.237 --> 01:18:39.863
Oh, look at the sky.

01:18:39.901 --> 01:18:41.811
It's gotten so overcast.

01:18:41.853 --> 01:18:43.576
And all the lights.

01:18:43.613 --> 01:18:45.173
What a city this is.

01:18:46.173 --> 01:18:47.548
Another year is passing.

01:18:48.285 --> 01:18:50.554
I hope 1944 turns out well.

01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:53.237
They pass so quickly.

01:18:53.277 --> 01:18:54.292
Where do they all go?

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.984
So quickly. Then we get old.

01:18:58.109 --> 01:19:00.530
And we never knew
what any of it was about.

01:19:00.573 --> 01:19:01.522
That's right.

01:19:02.749 --> 01:19:04.637
I wonder
if future generations...

01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:06.557
will ever even hear about us.

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:08.530
It's not likely.

01:19:09.597 --> 01:19:12.892
After enough time,
everything passes.

01:19:12.925 --> 01:19:16.754
I don't care how big we are or
how important are our lives.

01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:20.756
Six... five...

01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:23.098
four... three...

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.238
two... one...

01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:27.252
Happy New Year!

01:19:57.789 --> 01:19:59.098
Martin...

01:19:59.133 --> 01:20:01.370
I'm a little scared
for the future.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.577
What are you scared about?
She's always scared.

01:20:03.613 --> 01:20:04.540
Don't worry so much.

01:20:04.573 --> 01:20:05.588
Happy New Year!

01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:06.774
Happy New Year, Bea.

01:20:06.813 --> 01:20:08.188
Happy New Year, everyone!

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.203
Happy New Year.

01:20:09.245 --> 01:20:10.324
What is he doing up?

01:20:10.365 --> 01:20:14.074
I woke him so he wouldn't
forget 1944.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.313
Happy New Year!

01:20:16.349 --> 01:20:18.324
God, I wish this war was over!

01:20:18.365 --> 01:20:20.405
There are no single men around.

01:20:25.213 --> 01:20:27.318
This year you're gonna
find your true love.

01:20:27.357 --> 01:20:28.917
I have a feeling in my bones.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:29.939
Yes, you will.

01:20:29.981 --> 01:20:32.120
Oh! You know what we should
start the New Year with?

01:20:32.157 --> 01:20:34.743
A little red snapper!
Don't you think?

01:20:34.781 --> 01:20:36.821
Hey, Happy New Year, everybody.

01:20:36.861 --> 01:20:39.708
Happy New Year! Martin! Mama!

01:20:52.701 --> 01:20:54.195
Hey, it's starting to snow!

01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:55.611
Let's go downstairs.

01:21:20.285 --> 01:21:23.546
Beware, evildoers,
wherever you are!

01:21:37.341 --> 01:21:39.064
I never forgot
that New Year's Eve...

01:21:39.101 --> 01:21:42.963
when Aunt Bea awakened me to
watch 1944 come in.

01:21:44.093 --> 01:21:46.940
And I've never forgotten
any of those people...

01:21:46.973 --> 01:21:49.591
or any of the voices we used
to hear on the radio.

01:21:50.525 --> 01:21:52.281
Although the truth is...

01:21:52.317 --> 01:21:55.001
with the passing of
each New Year's Eve...

01:21:55.037 --> 01:21:58.747
those voices do seem
to grow dimmer and dimmer.
