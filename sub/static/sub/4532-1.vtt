WEBVTT

00:03.166 --> 00:06.397
Ladies and gentlemen,
Christopher Wilde!

00:12.126 --> 00:13.400
Every girl, every boy

00:13.446 --> 00:16.802
They got your posters on their walls

00:17.406 --> 00:20.125
Photographs, autographs
Soon as you step out the door

00:20.166 --> 00:21.758
You will meet the applause

00:21.806 --> 00:22.841
Yeah!

00:22.886 --> 00:28.040
Paparazzis hiding in the bushes
Trying to make a dollar

00:28.086 --> 00:30.122
Wanna be you, when they see you

00:30.166 --> 00:32.839
They scream out loud

00:33.126 --> 00:37.961
Starstruck, camera flashes
Cover of magazines

00:38.446 --> 00:42.678
Starstruck, designer sunglasses
Living the dream as a teen

00:42.726 --> 00:45.798
Driving fancy cars
Hollywood Boulevard

00:45.846 --> 00:48.963
Hear the crowd
calling your name, yeah!

00:49.006 --> 00:50.564
Starstruck!

00:50.606 --> 00:51.641
Prepare to get...

00:51.686 --> 00:53.199
Starstruck!

00:53.486 --> 00:54.885
All right!

00:56.246 --> 00:57.474
Yeah!

00:58.566 --> 01:00.045
Starstruck

01:01.606 --> 01:04.962
Yeah! Yay-yeah!

01:05.406 --> 01:06.521
As soon as you move

01:06.566 --> 01:07.840
They gonna talk about it

01:07.886 --> 01:09.239
In the paper, the news

01:09.286 --> 01:10.719
They gonna talk about it

01:10.766 --> 01:11.915
'Cause you're on the A-list

01:11.966 --> 01:16.596
You better believe it
You better believe it, yeah...

01:18.006 --> 01:20.201
I just love Christopher Wilde.

01:21.406 --> 01:22.725
'Cause you're in the top spot

01:22.766 --> 01:24.677
And nothing can stop ya
And nothing can stop ya

01:24.766 --> 01:25.960
Jessica!

01:26.966 --> 01:28.638
Oh, I'm sorry, Sara.

01:28.686 --> 01:30.722
Am I blocking your view
of what's his name?

01:30.766 --> 01:33.041
Move it or lose it, sister.

01:34.406 --> 01:36.476
Sara, Jessica. Suitcases.

01:36.526 --> 01:38.118
Come pick out your clothes
and get packed.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.397
We're leaving for the airport
right after school tomorrow.

01:43.246 --> 01:44.474
In less than 2 4 hours,

01:44.526 --> 01:47.518
I'll be in Los Angeles
where Christopher lives.

01:48.326 --> 01:50.282
What if he picks me up at the airport?

01:50.326 --> 01:52.078
Why would he do that?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.557
I'm an original member of his fan club.

01:54.606 --> 01:56.597
I follow his minute-by-minute
blog posts,

01:56.646 --> 01:58.841
and I text him every day.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.116
Trust me, he wants to meet me.

02:02.526 --> 02:04.642
ls it too late for me to be an only child?

02:04.686 --> 02:06.995
-Yes.
-Then can I please stay home?

02:07.046 --> 02:08.479
-No.
-Why not?

02:08.526 --> 02:10.642
Because your grandmother
hasn't seen you in two years.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.324
Plus, you're a minor and it's illegal.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.880
Everybody...
There's more about Christopher.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.678
The fabulous Christopher Wilde

02:16.726 --> 02:19.604
picked up six
Music Association Awards last night,

02:19.646 --> 02:21.921
just in time for his new CD,
Real Wilde,

02:21.966 --> 02:24.400
to drop, wow, double platinum.

02:24.646 --> 02:27.285
I caught up with our favourite pop star
on the red carpet.

02:27.326 --> 02:28.805
Well, first I'd love to say

02:28.846 --> 02:30.245
thank you so much
for buying the records

02:30.286 --> 02:31.878
and coming to my concerts.

02:31.926 --> 02:33.962
You're the reason I love what I do.

02:34.006 --> 02:35.917
You guys are the best fans
in the world. Thank you.

02:37.046 --> 02:39.514
He is such an amazing person.

02:40.006 --> 02:42.042
He's definitely not amazing.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.804
He is amazing.

02:43.846 --> 02:47.043
And if you knew him like I know him,
you wouldn't say that.

02:47.086 --> 02:51.045
Hello? We live in Michigan.
You don't know him.

02:51.846 --> 02:53.165
But I do.

02:53.526 --> 02:55.676
I know everything about him.

02:57.246 --> 02:59.521
I know where he works,

03:01.606 --> 03:02.834
eats,

03:04.206 --> 03:05.241
shops,

03:06.566 --> 03:07.601
surfs,

03:09.726 --> 03:10.875
and parties.

03:13.966 --> 03:15.638
-You ready to party?
-Absolutely.

03:15.686 --> 03:16.801
Well, let's do it!

03:16.846 --> 03:19.406
You know, out of all of your cars,
Angelina's my favourite.

03:19.446 --> 03:21.960
-Angelina?
-Yeah. I mean, look at her.

03:22.006 --> 03:24.440
Hey, does that new valet
look a little shifty to you?

03:26.086 --> 03:28.646
-No. Not really.
-He looks a little shifty to me.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.517
Come on, Stubby.
Let's find you a real girl.

03:30.566 --> 03:32.477
That is a real girl.

03:32.526 --> 03:34.881
Oh, wow. Look who it is.

03:34.926 --> 03:36.803
Christopher Wilde's girlfriend,

03:36.846 --> 03:39.838
the fantabulous,
fabulous Alexis Bender!

03:40.126 --> 03:41.764
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

03:42.126 --> 03:43.684
-Stubby.
-Yeah.

03:44.286 --> 03:45.560
You look beautiful tonight.

03:45.606 --> 03:49.235
I know. Wait until you see
what I'm wearing tomorrow.

03:49.286 --> 03:51.038
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

03:51.966 --> 03:53.365
My birthday?

03:54.206 --> 03:56.845
Baby, you promised
you were gonna sing.

03:57.126 --> 03:59.924
Right. Hey, I'll be there. Absolutely.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.004
Okay. Wait.

04:04.206 --> 04:06.845
-Something's wrong.
-Yeah, you're here.

04:07.486 --> 04:09.556
What? lt's guys' night out!

04:09.846 --> 04:11.837
Where are the paparazzi?

04:12.206 --> 04:14.720
Oh, you did not blog again, did you?

04:20.805 --> 04:22.000
There he is. Let's run.

04:22.046 --> 04:25.959
That's so weird. Hi.

04:26.606 --> 04:28.915
-Look right here.
-Just like that.

04:29.646 --> 04:32.114
All right, back-back up, guys. Back...
Back up! Back up!

04:32.166 --> 04:33.918
Okay, back up, back up,
back up, back up, back up!

04:33.966 --> 04:35.843
-Come on.
-What? Calm down.

04:38.926 --> 04:40.644
You're not invited.

04:40.686 --> 04:43.837
Everybody's invited, Sara.
lt's an all-school dance.

04:43.886 --> 04:46.241
The operative word being ''dance.''

04:46.726 --> 04:48.478
Embarrassing.

04:48.526 --> 04:51.836
Don't worry. I'm just going there
to cover it for the school paper.

04:52.886 --> 04:55.036
Are you bringing your camera
with you to California?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.804
AJ, of course I am.

04:56.846 --> 05:00.475
Because we still need pics
of Christopher Wilde!

05:00.526 --> 05:05.361
Talking, walking, singing, dancing,
moving, breathing.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.045
Why are you both
so hung up on this guy?

05:08.126 --> 05:09.605
''This guy''?

05:10.526 --> 05:13.245
-Now you see what I live with?
-Poor you.

05:13.286 --> 05:15.641
Little sister, when we go to California,

05:15.686 --> 05:17.517
you can play shuffleboard
with Grandma,

05:17.566 --> 05:20.478
but I'm going to meet
Christopher Wilde.

05:20.526 --> 05:22.881
And just how
are you planning to do that?

05:22.926 --> 05:25.759
Well, we've mapped out
his every move for the past 1 8 months.

05:25.806 --> 05:29.685
I know when and where he's likely to be
every second of every day.

05:29.726 --> 05:31.603
About the time we leave
for Los Angeles,

05:31.646 --> 05:34.877
he'll be having his daily meeting
with his managers.

05:41.206 --> 05:43.197
-He's late.
-He'll be here.

05:43.246 --> 05:44.599
You need to manage him better.

05:44.646 --> 05:46.238
Hello, we both manage him.

05:46.286 --> 05:49.198
He needs to know opportunities
like this don't come every day.

05:49.246 --> 05:50.884
He knows. He's not a kid.

05:50.926 --> 05:52.484
Yo. What's up?

05:53.326 --> 05:55.362
-You're late.
-Sorry, Mom.

05:56.926 --> 05:58.484
How you doing, Son?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.039
Great, great. Excited.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.919
Oh, honey, honey, honey.
You could have cleaned up a little bit.

06:02.966 --> 06:05.480
What? I'm... I'm totally clean.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.524
He looks like a street kid,
not a movie star.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.875
He looks fine.
Just be yourself, Christopher.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.359
All right.

06:11.886 --> 06:13.205
He's here.

06:14.086 --> 06:15.804
All right. This is it, bud.

06:15.846 --> 06:18.440
Your chance
at what we've always wanted.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.044
-Alan, please come in.
-Sherry. Daniel!

06:26.446 --> 06:29.438
-Great place you got here.
-Actually it's Christopher's.

06:29.486 --> 06:30.635
We just kind of work here.

06:30.686 --> 06:32.597
-All right. Christopher Wilde.
-Hey, Mr Smith.

06:32.646 --> 06:35.399
-My daughters are big fans of yours.
-Oh, great.

06:35.566 --> 06:38.034
-Wow! This is great.
-Please.

06:39.126 --> 06:41.594
I love this. I love this.

06:42.126 --> 06:44.686
Rock and roll! Hello, Cleveland!

06:46.566 --> 06:48.921
Awesome. Got this album at the house.

06:48.966 --> 06:50.365
Girls love this.

06:50.406 --> 06:51.839
Something Wilde.

06:51.886 --> 06:54.002
All right, now let's get right to the point.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.320
Let's get right to it.

06:55.366 --> 06:58.756
l've been watching you
and I like what I see.

06:58.806 --> 07:02.242
You are a talented, talented kid.
He's a talented kid.

07:02.286 --> 07:05.039
You sing, you dance.
I hope you can act.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.041
Because I like you for this movie.

07:09.086 --> 07:10.360
Thank you, sir.
I mean, coming from you,

07:10.406 --> 07:12.362
this would be such an honour to...
I mean, to work with someone...

07:12.406 --> 07:14.636
But my people don't necessarily
agree with me.

07:14.686 --> 07:19.237
See, all they see is a spoiled punk
who likes to tangle with the paparazzi.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.120
Alan, you know how the tabloids are.
They manipulate those photos to...

07:23.166 --> 07:25.282
Daniel, I get it. I get it.

07:25.806 --> 07:27.524
Look, all I'm saying, kid,

07:27.566 --> 07:30.399
is a chance like this
comes along once in a lifetime,

07:30.446 --> 07:31.481
and I want to give you a shot,

07:31.526 --> 07:35.235
but you have to prove that
you're a serious and committed actor.

07:35.286 --> 07:36.321
How do I do that?

07:36.366 --> 07:37.765
On Monday,
I'm gonna meet with my people,

07:37.806 --> 07:39.159
try and sell them on you.

07:39.206 --> 07:41.276
In the meantime,
you keep your face out of the tabloids.

07:41.326 --> 07:43.715
No press, good or bad. Okay?

07:44.526 --> 07:46.960
-l can do that.
-In fact, stay home.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.202
-All right.
-Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

07:58.286 --> 08:00.754
You're such a dork.
You brought homework?

08:00.806 --> 08:03.843
No. lt's called reading.
You should try it sometime.

08:03.886 --> 08:05.444
What? I read.

08:07.326 --> 08:09.282
This? lt's all pictures.

08:09.726 --> 08:11.318
Don't touch that!

08:11.406 --> 08:12.600
Gladly.

08:13.646 --> 08:15.204
What's taking them so long?

08:15.246 --> 08:18.841
Just get me a car already
so I can go meet Christopher Wilde.

08:19.526 --> 08:21.960
Sara. You can't drive.

08:22.206 --> 08:24.162
Yes, I can. Licence.

08:24.526 --> 08:26.437
No, you can't. Sign.

08:28.526 --> 08:30.994
''You must be at least
25-years-old to drive

08:31.046 --> 08:33.924
''or rent a car from
Los Angeles Car Rental''?

08:34.525 --> 08:35.720
What?

08:37.206 --> 08:39.515
How am I supposed to do
what I wanna do?

08:39.566 --> 08:41.397
And what would that be?

08:42.525 --> 08:46.121
Take Jessica sightseeing.

08:46.366 --> 08:49.517
Well, I think your grandma's
got a car you can borrow.

08:49.566 --> 08:50.601
Sweet.

08:51.566 --> 08:54.034
See what I mean? Mom, be careful!

08:54.086 --> 08:55.678
Here comes the cavalry.

08:55.726 --> 08:56.954
You could fall and break a hip.

08:57.006 --> 09:01.363
Oh, now, Barbara. Calm down.
Howard had my back. Hi.

09:01.406 --> 09:03.442
We take care of each other.

09:05.326 --> 09:06.725
Okay then.

09:09.646 --> 09:11.079
-Grandma!
-Jessica!

09:11.126 --> 09:12.844
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.525
-l've missed you so much.
-Ditto.

09:15.566 --> 09:18.558
Sara. You can take her
for a spin if you want to.

09:18.606 --> 09:21.518
Just gave her a tune-up.
She runs like a top.

09:21.886 --> 09:25.879
Yeah, a super-ugly top
you'd never want to be seen in.

09:27.246 --> 09:30.522
Does that mean
you'll be joining us for shuffleboard?

09:35.006 --> 09:36.644
Sara out!

09:39.366 --> 09:42.403
Grandma says stop pacing.
You're creating a draught.

09:42.446 --> 09:43.674
I just got a call from AJ.

09:43.726 --> 09:45.125
She just had a chat about a text

09:45.166 --> 09:46.758
quoting a blog
about Christopher Wilde.

09:46.806 --> 09:49.604
He's singing tonight
at Alexis Bender's birthday party.

09:49.646 --> 09:51.045
I have to go!

09:51.086 --> 09:53.805
Good luck
convincing Mom and Dad of that.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.036
-Go with me.
-No.

09:58.006 --> 09:59.200
They'll let me go if you go, too.

09:59.246 --> 10:01.123
How many times do I have to say this?

10:01.166 --> 10:03.839
I'm not interested in meeting
a stupid celebrity.

10:03.886 --> 10:06.081
I mean, I am sick and tired
of Christopher Wilde.

10:06.126 --> 10:08.765
-He's all you talk about.
-I'll shut up.

10:08.806 --> 10:10.319
-What?
-lf you go with me,

10:10.366 --> 10:14.120
and I meet Christopher Wilde,
I'll stop talking about him

10:14.166 --> 10:15.679
for the rest of the trip.

10:15.726 --> 10:17.717
How about the rest of your life?

10:17.766 --> 10:18.960
Please?

10:20.000 --> 10:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:28.366 --> 10:30.436
What are you doing?
This is a no-parking zone.

10:30.486 --> 10:34.445
When one person stays in the car,
it's not parking. lt's waiting.

10:34.486 --> 10:36.283
We'll get a ticket.

10:37.726 --> 10:40.320
Just get behind the wheel!

10:40.446 --> 10:41.925
-Do it!
-Okay!

10:43.766 --> 10:45.085
Every boy, every girl

10:45.126 --> 10:48.721
They got your posters
on their wall, yeah!

10:55.766 --> 10:57.916
I don't know about this, man.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.641
-Nah, it'll be fine.
-We shouldn't even be here.

11:00.686 --> 11:02.165
I mean, we should be at home,

11:02.206 --> 11:04.401
chilling at that party
your parents are throwing.

11:04.446 --> 11:07.404
Since when do you want
to party with my parents?

11:07.446 --> 11:10.518
Are you kidding?
The caterer's from Argentina.

11:10.566 --> 11:13.080
There's gonna be steak for dessert.

11:13.486 --> 11:16.637
Tempting, but I promised Alexis
l'd sing at her birthday.

11:16.686 --> 11:20.474
-I'm not going to let her down.
-You and your stupid friendship rules!

11:20.526 --> 11:22.517
Yeah, they work for you, don't they?

11:22.566 --> 11:25.126
Stay at my house for free,
eat my food, drive my cars...

11:25.166 --> 11:27.077
Okay, okay.

11:27.326 --> 11:31.922
And in return, you get to hang out
with myself, Albert J. Stubbins.

11:31.966 --> 11:33.843
Best friend since fourth grade.

11:33.886 --> 11:36.320
Yeah. Works for me, too, Stubs.

11:37.246 --> 11:38.281
Let's do this.

11:41.646 --> 11:42.999
He's here.

11:48.606 --> 11:50.119
Just stay here.

12:02.046 --> 12:05.322
Alexis! Baby! Happy Birthday.

12:07.966 --> 12:10.639
-Where's Christopher?
-He couldn't make it.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.758
-He's at home eating steak.
-Alexis, where's your boyfriend?

12:13.806 --> 12:14.955
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

12:15.006 --> 12:16.234
-Stubby!
-What?

12:16.286 --> 12:18.561
I'm so sorry I'm late! Come on!

12:20.086 --> 12:22.202
-Do you know her?
-Not yet.

12:23.566 --> 12:26.080
Great. I'm gonna be here forever.

12:37.246 --> 12:38.474
Thanks.

12:42.606 --> 12:44.437
Looks like we pulled it off.

12:44.606 --> 12:45.641
What would you do without me?

12:45.686 --> 12:47.836
Our birthday girl in the VIP section,

12:47.886 --> 12:50.764
Alexis Bender,

Excuse me. Move!

15:35.486 --> 15:37.363
No. Oh, no!

16:11.686 --> 16:12.835
Did I just hit you?

16:12.886 --> 16:14.683
No, the door hit me by itself.

16:14.726 --> 16:16.637
-This is not good.
-For you or for me?

16:16.686 --> 16:18.244
'Cause right now
it feels a lot worse for me.

16:18.286 --> 16:20.595
-This is really not good.
-Wait.

16:22.206 --> 16:23.321
You're Chris...

16:23.366 --> 16:24.640
I will give you front-row tickets
to my next concert

16:24.686 --> 16:27.837
-if you don't scream my name.
-l don't want to see your stupid concert.

16:28.766 --> 16:31.200
Okay. I need to get you to a doctor.

16:31.486 --> 16:33.044
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:33.086 --> 16:35.839
No, get this hand. This hand.
There we go. Come on. Just...

16:35.886 --> 16:38.400
-What about Sara?
-Who's Sara?

16:38.446 --> 16:40.835
My sister. She's up in the club.

16:42.006 --> 16:44.201
-What happened?
-Look, help now. Questions later.

16:44.246 --> 16:46.714
-Okay.
-Just get her in the car.

16:52.726 --> 16:54.717
-Who is this?
-Seat belt.

16:54.766 --> 16:56.882
-What is your name?
-Jessica.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.234
Well, it's nice to meet you, Jessica.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.277
I can think of nicer ways.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.154
I'm not feeling too hot.

17:08.205 --> 17:10.196
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Do not hurl in Britney, okay?

17:10.246 --> 17:12.202
-l just got her detailed.
-Okay.

17:12.246 --> 17:15.521
Oh, no, those are my favourite shoes!

17:16.286 --> 17:18.402
I'll buy you new ones. Door.

17:18.806 --> 17:22.320
Keys. Just make sure
her sister Sara gets home okay.

17:22.366 --> 17:24.925
Just don't tell anyone about this.

17:24.965 --> 17:27.526
I got to get some new shoes!

17:31.646 --> 17:34.206
Follow the light with your eyes.

17:36.366 --> 17:40.200
Well, l've done a thorough exam,
and the CT scan was normal.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.444
Everything looks good.

17:42.486 --> 17:44.158
-So she's okay?
-Out.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.635
There's no sign of head trauma,

17:46.686 --> 17:49.120
and I'm absolutely certain
you don't have a concussion.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.485
How come I threw up?

17:50.526 --> 17:52.005
Maybe it was something you ate.

17:52.046 --> 17:55.197
Or maybe it was a reaction
to meeting that doofus.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.078
lt's a curtain, Sanjay. I can hear you.

17:58.126 --> 17:59.718
No, no, you can't.

17:59.886 --> 18:03.515
-You two know each other?
-Yeah. He's my sister's husband.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.400
So I can go now?

18:05.446 --> 18:08.483
Yes, but I want you to put an ice pack
on that bump until you get home.

18:08.526 --> 18:10.642
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

18:15.686 --> 18:18.439
-You gonna answer that?
-Oh, right. Just...

18:23.006 --> 18:24.758
Hello, Mom? What?

18:25.846 --> 18:26.961
Who?

18:27.366 --> 18:28.560
Where?

18:28.606 --> 18:29.675
Now?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.523
Yes! Right now!

18:31.566 --> 18:32.601
We thought he wasn't coming,

18:32.646 --> 18:34.921
but he just showed up
with your two biggest fans.

18:34.966 --> 18:37.719
Look, you promised him you were
gonna stay home this weekend.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.358
lt's up to you to fix this, Christopher.

18:39.406 --> 18:41.237
Okay. Just stall them.
I will be right there.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.878
-Sherry!
-Alan!

18:42.926 --> 18:44.075
Where is he?

18:44.446 --> 18:46.004
-That might be a problem.
-Why?

18:46.046 --> 18:48.560
My waiting room is filled with big guys
with big cameras.

18:48.606 --> 18:50.801
You... The paparazzi found me?

18:51.846 --> 18:54.076
Okay, Sanjay,
what kind of car you driving?

18:54.126 --> 18:55.161
Nothing you'd be interested in.

18:55.206 --> 18:57.242
I'm still paying off six years
of medical school.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.595
-Perfect. How about a trade?
-No.

19:00.046 --> 19:01.525
Only happens once.

19:01.566 --> 19:02.760
Okay.

19:16.726 --> 19:17.920
Are you sure this is safe?

19:17.966 --> 19:19.365
I'm pretty sure.

19:19.406 --> 19:21.476
-I'm pretty sure it's not!
-Just calm down, okay?

19:21.526 --> 19:25.155
I don't wanna calm down!
I wanna go home! Okay?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.242
-What is wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?

19:27.286 --> 19:30.084
Nothing. Nothing. I'm looking forward
to being grounded until I'm 30!

19:30.126 --> 19:31.161
Oh, is that why you're so crabby?

19:31.206 --> 19:32.958
-I'm not crabby!
-Not crabby. Defensive.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.883
-l am not defensive.
-See?

19:34.926 --> 19:36.644
You disagree with everything I say.

19:36.686 --> 19:37.755
-Do not!
-Do, too!

19:37.806 --> 19:40.081
-Just take me home!
-l will!

19:40.526 --> 19:43.643
First we need to make one
teeny-tiny little stop.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.402
You've got to be kidding.

19:49.366 --> 19:51.516
-You live here?
-Yeah, why?

19:52.846 --> 19:54.325
-Go, go. Let's go.
-What are you doing?

19:54.366 --> 19:55.719
Got to go upstairs. Got to go.

19:55.766 --> 19:57.597
-Stop pulling me!
-I'm sorry. I just...

19:57.646 --> 19:59.762
Where are we going? Christopher!

19:59.806 --> 20:02.001
-I'm sorry. I just don't know...
-Don't know where to hide me?

20:02.046 --> 20:03.320
No, I'm not hiding you.

20:03.366 --> 20:06.836
lt's just that I don't want these
particular people to see you right now.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.205
And because I'm not a movie star.

20:08.246 --> 20:11.363
No! Okay, because I don't want anyone
asking questions and neither do you.

20:11.406 --> 20:12.964
Who is she? Where did you meet her?
Are you two dating?

20:13.006 --> 20:16.635
-Dating?
-Yeah, they make stuff up. Come on.

20:21.006 --> 20:22.598
The guestroom. Be my guest.

20:22.646 --> 20:25.001
-Do I have a choice?
-Not really. I'll be right back.

20:25.046 --> 20:26.445
Just stay.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.841
Woof.

20:32.046 --> 20:33.764
Good to see you.

20:33.846 --> 20:36.155
I'm glad you came. Thanks for coming.

20:36.206 --> 20:39.198
Hey! Hey, how are you?
So nice to see you.

20:39.766 --> 20:41.563
Looking good, buddy.

20:43.406 --> 20:45.397
-Hey. lt's about time.
-Hey, Mom.

20:45.446 --> 20:47.038
-How you doing, bud?
-Good to see you.

20:47.086 --> 20:48.644
-Christopher, my daughters.
-Oh, yeah. What's up?

20:48.686 --> 20:50.005
I think they wanted to
ask you something.

20:50.046 --> 20:51.195
-Yeah.
-Can you sing us a song?

20:51.246 --> 20:52.964
Of course, absolutely.
l've got something new I'm working on.

20:53.006 --> 20:54.041
-Can you grab me a stool?
-Sure, Chris.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.804
-You know where your guitar is?
-Yeah. Of course.

20:55.846 --> 20:57.677
You're gonna love this.

21:04.566 --> 21:06.079
Hey, everybody.

21:06.126 --> 21:08.640
This is a little something
I'm working on for my next album.

21:08.686 --> 21:10.438
I hope you like it.

21:25.686 --> 21:30.476
I'm no superman
I can't take your hand

21:30.526 --> 21:35.441
And fly you anywhere
you wanna go, yeah

21:35.966 --> 21:41.040
I can't read your mind
Like a billboard sign

21:41.086 --> 21:44.965
And tell you everything
you want to hear

21:45.006 --> 21:50.444
But I'll be your hero

21:50.846 --> 21:55.681
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

21:55.726 --> 21:57.398
If you're the one for me

21:57.446 --> 22:01.519
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

22:01.566 --> 22:05.923
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

22:05.966 --> 22:11.359
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

22:11.726 --> 22:15.605
But if you're the one for me

22:15.646 --> 22:18.240
Then I'll be your hero

22:19.486 --> 22:25.880
Oh, I'll be your hero, yeah

22:26.206 --> 22:28.436
I'll be your hero

22:28.486 --> 22:30.636
So incredible

22:30.926 --> 22:33.394
Some kind of miracle

22:33.446 --> 22:35.357
That when it's meant to be

22:35.406 --> 22:39.638
I'll become a hero, oh

22:39.686 --> 22:44.806
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you

22:47.326 --> 22:52.320
Yeah, I'll be a hero, yeah

22:53.726 --> 22:58.356
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

22:58.406 --> 23:00.124
If you're the one for me

23:00.166 --> 23:04.318
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

23:04.366 --> 23:08.757
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

23:33.126 --> 23:34.844
Hero

23:42.966 --> 23:44.638
Great. Great.

23:44.686 --> 23:47.359
So, girls, am I the greatest Dad
in the world or what?

24:02.846 --> 24:04.757
Hey! Where you going?

24:05.166 --> 24:06.918
Anywhere but here.

24:06.966 --> 24:08.160
What did I do now?

24:08.206 --> 24:10.720
You said you'd take me home. When?

24:11.566 --> 24:12.760
Just pick a car. I'll take you home.

24:12.806 --> 24:15.115
-No!
-Fine, we'll walk.

24:15.846 --> 24:18.121
-Where does Grandma live again?
-Hollywood.

24:18.166 --> 24:21.158
Oh, that's great.
We'll get there on Tuesday.

24:23.326 --> 24:24.918
-Okay.
-Okay?

24:25.246 --> 24:26.565
But here are the rules.

24:26.606 --> 24:28.483
You drive me straight there,
drop me off,

24:28.526 --> 24:31.359
and then you come back
to your fabulous life.

24:39.606 --> 24:42.564
What's the purpose of that?
I don't get it.

24:43.486 --> 24:45.078
Why does she do this?

25:14.806 --> 25:18.242
There's something about
the sunshine, baby

25:18.286 --> 25:21.642
I'm seeing you in a whole new light

25:21.686 --> 25:22.880
Really?

25:24.486 --> 25:26.681
What? I thought you'd like it.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.195
Let me guess.

25:28.246 --> 25:30.555
You thought l'd be dying to ride
in a car with Christopher Wilde

25:30.606 --> 25:32.881
as he sings to one of his big hits.

25:32.926 --> 25:36.714
A fan's dream come true!
There's just one problem.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.916
-Which is?
-I'm not your fan.

25:41.606 --> 25:44.200
You don't... You don't like my music?

25:44.566 --> 25:47.797
No, I like your music.
I'm just not crazy about you.

25:48.926 --> 25:51.565
-But you don't even know me.
-Precisely.

25:55.206 --> 25:57.162
You know, I think if you...
I think if you did know me,

25:57.206 --> 25:59.766
-you'd really like me.
-Turn here.

26:26.006 --> 26:28.884
-Thanks for the ride.
-Hey, look, Jessica.

26:30.086 --> 26:31.758
Look, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

26:31.806 --> 26:33.637
Noted. Are we done now?

26:34.286 --> 26:37.483
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess we're done.
-Good.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.565
Okay, bye.

26:51.286 --> 26:53.083
Oh, great.

27:13.606 --> 27:14.641
Go away.

27:14.686 --> 27:16.916
Look, I'll give you $5,000
if you do me this favour.

27:16.966 --> 27:19.116
lt's not a favour if you pay for it.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.758
So is that a yes?

27:25.526 --> 27:27.084
You know, you can help a little.

27:27.126 --> 27:30.323
No, this car wouldn't be moving
if I wasn't pushing it.

27:30.366 --> 27:32.482
You'll be out of here before morning,
right?

27:32.526 --> 27:34.994
Yes. Hopefully no one will ever know
I was here.

27:35.046 --> 27:36.365
I'll know.

27:36.646 --> 27:39.399
-Thank you. Thanks a lot.
-Yeah.

27:42.206 --> 27:44.003
Hey, is there anything up there
that I can wear

27:44.046 --> 27:46.162
so when I do leave,
the paparazzi won't recognise me?

27:46.206 --> 27:48.197
You can look in those.

27:49.606 --> 27:51.881
So, is all this really necessary?

27:51.926 --> 27:55.839
Yes. Clearly you don't understand.
They're everywhere.

27:56.486 --> 27:57.714
Paranoid.

27:58.006 --> 27:59.564
You know what? Just forget it.

27:59.606 --> 28:00.959
Love to.

28:02.406 --> 28:03.555
Well?

28:05.566 --> 28:07.397
That was my grandpa's hat.

28:07.446 --> 28:09.243
He used to wear it
when he took me fishing.

28:09.286 --> 28:11.242
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. Here.

28:11.286 --> 28:14.244
No. You keep it.
lt looks kind of good on you.

28:14.566 --> 28:15.715
Thanks.

28:16.286 --> 28:17.435
Anything else?

28:17.486 --> 28:19.636
No. No, I'm cool.

28:19.686 --> 28:22.439
Yeah.
So cool you're sleeping in your car.

28:22.726 --> 28:24.045
Jessica.

28:25.766 --> 28:27.563
-Stop doing that!
-What am I doing?

28:27.606 --> 28:29.642
Oh, you know exactly
what you're doing.

28:29.686 --> 28:31.517
In fact, I bet you do it all the time.

28:31.566 --> 28:35.878
You give girls that look
and expect them to fall for you.

28:35.926 --> 28:38.884
Well, it's not working with me,
so get over it!

28:48.366 --> 28:51.995
Eat up. We're helping Grandma
with some yard work today.

28:52.046 --> 28:54.196
-Morning, sunshine.
-Hey.

28:56.766 --> 28:58.245
-Syrup, please.
-l didn't see any.

28:58.286 --> 29:01.596
-Mom, got any more syrup?
-Oh, sure. On the shelf in the garage.

29:01.646 --> 29:03.079
I'll get it.

29:05.446 --> 29:07.038
No. I'll get it.

29:09.126 --> 29:12.357
-How was your little cab ride?
-What cab ride?

29:12.406 --> 29:15.557
What cab ride? I am this close
to meeting Christopher Wilde,

29:15.606 --> 29:17.358
and I have to leave because Stubby

29:17.406 --> 29:19.362
tells me that you decided
to take a cab home.

29:19.406 --> 29:20.839
Oh, that cab.

29:21.606 --> 29:25.758
Where did you go? Wait. Don't tell me.
I don't wanna be that bored.

29:25.966 --> 29:28.526
I'll make it up to you.
I'll help you find him.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.875
How are you going to do that?

29:32.326 --> 29:36.160
Let's go... Let's go inside and research.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.124
Mom and Dad don't even need to know.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.884
Mom and Dad
don't need to know what?

29:39.926 --> 29:41.723
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

29:48.966 --> 29:51.082
I don't understand you girls.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.798
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Yeah, great.

29:58.766 --> 30:00.916
Oh, Sara.
They're doing a story on television

30:00.966 --> 30:02.558
about that boy you like so much.
In there.

30:02.606 --> 30:03.880
Yeah.

30:06.366 --> 30:07.958
-No!
-What is with you?

30:08.006 --> 30:09.758
I don't...

30:10.846 --> 30:13.519
Alexis Bender arrived
at her birthday party last night

30:13.566 --> 30:15.522
without her leading man.

30:15.566 --> 30:19.081
Although no one saw him arrive
at the fabulous Club Under 2 1,

30:19.126 --> 30:22.004
witnesses confirm that
Christopher Wilde did indeed

30:22.046 --> 30:25.880
make a secret appearance to sing
for the packed house of well-wishers.

30:25.926 --> 30:28.121
Partygoers say the pop star
left the club immediately

30:28.166 --> 30:29.440
following his performance,

30:29.486 --> 30:32.205
only to magically reappear
at his Beverly Hills mansion

30:32.246 --> 30:34.999
several hours later with a different girl.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.004
My sources tell me this mystery girl

30:37.046 --> 30:39.401
might be stealing the heart
of our favourite pop star.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.959
Stop! I wanna see that!

30:41.006 --> 30:43.281
Why? lt's all lies. Technically, slander.

30:43.326 --> 30:45.476
Why do you care?
You don't even like him.

30:45.526 --> 30:48.199
I care about the truth.
And I'm pretty sure that's not it.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.282
-Girls, knock it off.
-l know what.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.159
lt's a beautiful day. Here.

30:53.206 --> 30:55.083
Take the keys to my car,
and go to the beach.

30:55.126 --> 30:57.003
Really? Thanks, Grandma.

30:59.486 --> 31:01.397
Take Jessica with you.

31:02.966 --> 31:04.001
Go.

31:30.846 --> 31:33.918
I thought we were going to Venice.
Why are we in Malibu?

31:33.966 --> 31:36.844
Because Christopher Wilde
surfs in Malibu.

31:39.206 --> 31:42.721
Today's the day. I can feel it.
He's here somewhere.

31:43.086 --> 31:44.201
I doubt that.

31:44.246 --> 31:46.157
I just hope
he's not with Alexis Bender, who,

31:46.206 --> 31:49.164
lMHO, is totally not cute enough
for him.

31:51.206 --> 31:54.437
I wonder what his eyes look like.
Up close.

31:55.366 --> 31:57.880
Blue. Really blue.

32:07.846 --> 32:10.280
Excuse me. ls this seat taken?

32:12.366 --> 32:14.277
No? Okay.

32:17.086 --> 32:20.078
What a beautiful day.
lsn't it a beautiful day?

32:23.126 --> 32:26.357
Oh, I'm sorry. You were sleeping.
Did I wake you?

32:27.766 --> 32:30.121
No? Oh, then you're awake. Good.

32:32.006 --> 32:34.645
Would you put some
sunscreen on my back?

32:38.406 --> 32:41.045
-How did you know it was me?
-The hat.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.405
Does kind of smell like fish.

32:43.446 --> 32:45.676
No, I'm pretty sure that's you.

32:47.326 --> 32:49.157
Now, what are you doing here?

32:49.206 --> 32:50.924
What are you doing here? Go home.

32:50.966 --> 32:52.684
-l tried.
-And?

32:54.166 --> 32:56.555
Nah, you wouldn't understand.

32:57.166 --> 32:59.600
So you think you're so special
that a nobody like me

32:59.646 --> 33:03.082
couldn't possibly understand
how hard it is to be you?

33:04.286 --> 33:05.685
Okay.

33:05.726 --> 33:10.117
There were about 1 0 paparazzi parked
outside my house with their cameras.

33:12.326 --> 33:14.078
Yeah, that is tough.

33:15.526 --> 33:16.800
Not.

33:17.526 --> 33:19.403
See, you don't understand.

33:19.446 --> 33:23.519
I just need to get home in a car
the paparazzi won't recognise.

33:27.326 --> 33:29.237
So what are you driving?

33:30.206 --> 33:33.323
Oh, you'd love it. lt's a classic.
Really vintage.

33:33.366 --> 33:34.845
Perfect. I could pay you.

33:34.886 --> 33:36.399
-l know that's kind of...
-Stop that!

33:36.446 --> 33:38.482
-Stop what?
-Throwing your money around.

33:38.526 --> 33:42.883
I mean, you still owe me five grand
for staying at Garage de la Grandma.

33:45.246 --> 33:47.555
-Just give me your keys.
-Why?

33:48.526 --> 33:52.041
Well, if you're taking our car,
you can't leave us here without one.

33:52.086 --> 33:53.235
Keys.

33:55.046 --> 33:56.365
Come on.

34:00.926 --> 34:02.598
Okay, look, she's a...

34:02.646 --> 34:04.364
She's a 300 and...

34:04.886 --> 34:06.604
Three hundred
and thirty-five horsepower,

34:06.646 --> 34:10.764
first generation '69 Tudor
with original paint.

34:11.525 --> 34:13.641
Look, I love Cher, okay?

34:14.005 --> 34:15.199
Cher?

34:16.246 --> 34:18.123
You name your cars?

34:36.406 --> 34:38.966
Christopher, meet Petunia.

34:41.606 --> 34:43.483
You've got to be kidding me.

34:43.525 --> 34:46.962
She runs like a top.
Have her back here in an hour.

34:50.686 --> 34:52.199
Down. Get down.

34:52.246 --> 34:55.079
I can't believe it.
How do they know where to find me?

34:55.126 --> 34:58.801
My sister knows where to find you,
and she's from Kalamazoo.

35:03.046 --> 35:05.162
All right, here. Put these on.

35:05.206 --> 35:07.561
He's probably under an umbrella.
Look under an umbrella.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.085
-Now!
-Okay.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.236
All right. Get in the car.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.124
He's got to be around here, all right.

35:22.166 --> 35:24.316
Okay, you really need
to stop hitting me.

35:24.366 --> 35:27.517
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just get in. Get in. Get in!

35:31.246 --> 35:32.838
Quick, buckle up. Put your head down.

35:32.886 --> 35:35.639
-Put your head down. Head down.
-lt's down.

35:37.766 --> 35:39.802
-What are you doing?
-I'm looking for something.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.518
Here, put this on.

35:41.646 --> 35:43.045
-What... Why?
-Do it now!

35:43.086 --> 35:44.121
-Come on.
-Okay.

36:14.646 --> 36:17.365
You know what?
You drive like my grandpa.

36:17.846 --> 36:19.996
And you look like my grandma.

36:21.086 --> 36:23.395
-Okay.
-l need my sunglasses back.

36:23.446 --> 36:25.801
I don't know. I kind of like them.

36:25.846 --> 36:28.599
-I'll give them to you. Later.
-For reals?

36:28.646 --> 36:31.001
Because my friends just won't believe
that l, Jessica Olson,

36:31.046 --> 36:32.877
have an actual pair
of Christopher Wilde sunglasses

36:32.926 --> 36:35.486
worn by Christopher Wilde himself.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.282
Will you autograph them for me?

36:38.326 --> 36:40.396
-Very funny.
-What?

36:40.446 --> 36:43.199
No, but seriously.
I really want these glasses.

36:43.246 --> 36:45.077
Give them. Come on.

36:45.886 --> 36:49.401
So, how long do I have to
drive around with you this time?

36:49.446 --> 36:51.482
Only until the paparazzi
leave the beach.

36:51.526 --> 36:53.801
-Hey, let's go do something.
-Like what?

36:53.846 --> 36:55.916
Anything. What have you seen
since you've been here?

36:55.966 --> 36:59.083
Nothing. l've been too busy
following you around.

37:00.366 --> 37:03.085
-Really?
-With my sister.

37:03.126 --> 37:04.844
She idolises you.

37:04.886 --> 37:07.923
I mean, l, on the other hand,
couldn't care less about you

37:07.966 --> 37:09.479
or your city.

37:09.806 --> 37:12.081
Well, I know you don't like me,
but don't take it out on Los Angeles.

37:12.126 --> 37:13.878
This is one of the greatest cities
in the world.

37:13.926 --> 37:17.202
-Really?
-In fact, I'll be your tour guide.

37:17.246 --> 37:18.884
I thought you needed to get home.

37:18.926 --> 37:20.996
Nah. Take the long way.

37:30.766 --> 37:32.996
Wake up to the blue sky

37:33.046 --> 37:36.641
Grab your shades
and let's go for a ride

37:38.086 --> 37:40.156
Breakfast by the ocean

37:40.526 --> 37:43.677
We'll do lunch at Sunset and Vine

37:45.486 --> 37:49.081
-Every day's a dream in California
-Every day's a dream in California

37:49.126 --> 37:52.801
-Every night the stars come out to play
-Every night the stars come out to play

37:52.846 --> 37:55.565
-Wish that I could always
-Wish that I could always

37:55.606 --> 37:58.643
-Feel this way
-Feel this way

38:00.126 --> 38:01.764
-There's something about

38:01.806 --> 38:03.637

-I'm seeing you in a whole new light

-Outta this world for the first time, baby

38:11.286 --> 38:14.642
-Oh, it's so right
-Oh, it's so right

38:15.406 --> 38:18.921
-There's something about the sunshine
-There's something about the sunshine

38:18.966 --> 38:22.322
-There's something about the sunshine
-There's something about the sunshine

38:22.366 --> 38:24.596
In Hollywood, we're rockin'

38:24.646 --> 38:28.002
In Malibu, we hang out and chill

38:29.606 --> 38:31.995
It's all about the shopping

38:32.046 --> 38:35.561
From Melrose to Beverly Hills

38:37.246 --> 38:38.759
-Everywhere's a scene
-Everywhere's a scene

38:38.806 --> 38:40.797

39:02.846 --> 39:05.644
-Oh, it's so right
-Oh, it's so right

39:05.686 --> 39:07.642
Now that you're here

39:07.686 --> 39:09.324
Now that you're here

39:09.366 --> 39:11.038
It's suddenly clear

39:11.086 --> 39:12.917
It's suddenly clear

39:12.966 --> 39:14.797
-The sun's coming through
-The sun's coming through

39:14.846 --> 39:16.643

39:20.206 --> 39:22.766
It's better with you

39:25.006 --> 39:26.598
Yeah, yeah

39:28.686 --> 39:31.484
There's something about
the sunshine, baby

39:31.526 --> 39:32.561
There's something about it

39:32.606 --> 39:36.201
-I'm seeing you in a whole new light
-Whole new light

39:36.246 --> 39:39.955
-Outta this world for the first time, baby
-Baby

39:40.006 --> 39:42.281
-Oh, it's so right
-Oh, it's so right

39:42.326 --> 39:43.554
So right

39:43.606 --> 39:47.076
-Something about the sunshine, baby
-Something about the sunshine, baby

39:47.126 --> 39:50.835

-Oh, it's so right
-Oh, it's so right

39:58.366 --> 40:01.836
There's something about
the sunshine, baby

40:01.886 --> 40:05.481
I'm seeing you in a whole new light

40:05.526 --> 40:06.879
-LA 's a breeze
-LA 's a breeze

-with the palm trees swayin'
-with the palm trees swayin'

40:09.046 --> 40:11.082
What a perfect day.

40:14.126 --> 40:15.718
Not any more.

40:17.446 --> 40:20.040
Man. I need to lose these vans.

40:24.806 --> 40:26.125
Okay. Take your next left.

40:26.166 --> 40:27.758
-You're sure?
-Yes.

40:41.726 --> 40:46.277
Okay, if you take your next left,
the road loops back to the highway.

40:48.206 --> 40:50.242
Or maybe not.

40:50.366 --> 40:53.244
This isn't even a road any more.
This is a firebreak, it has to be.

40:53.286 --> 40:55.481
Just... Just keep driving.

40:55.766 --> 40:58.360
That last sign said ''Deer crossing.''
There are no deer.

40:58.406 --> 41:00.442
You know,
you complain more than my sister.

41:00.486 --> 41:02.681
Are we on the right road or not?

41:03.526 --> 41:05.721
-Not?
-Show it to me.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.722
No! Keep your eyes on the road.
I'm the navigator.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.165
ls that what you call it?

41:09.206 --> 41:11.436
-What's that supposed to mean?
-lt means you're such a know-it-all.

41:11.486 --> 41:13.158
-A what?
-A know-it-all!

41:13.206 --> 41:15.322
God, you are the queen
of snap judgements.

41:15.366 --> 41:17.118
''Turn here! This is the right road!
I'm sure of it!''

41:17.166 --> 41:18.758
-l was sure of it.
-You're sure.

41:18.806 --> 41:20.603
You're so sure of things
you couldn't possibly be sure about.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.001
-l am not.
-And you're defensive.

41:23.046 --> 41:25.355
Move the car! We're not moving.

41:38.686 --> 41:39.835
Great.

41:42.486 --> 41:44.283
We'll have to get out and push.

41:44.326 --> 41:46.965
-Wait, wait, wait. Look, I'll help you.
-Don't touch me.

41:47.006 --> 41:50.282
-Why are you so mad?
-l don't know. This.

41:50.326 --> 41:51.759
Look, turning onto this road
was not my idea.

41:51.806 --> 41:53.797
-You're blaming me?
-Yeah, you're a terrible navigator!

41:53.846 --> 41:55.837
-You're a terrible driver!
-Hey, I'm a great driver.

41:55.886 --> 41:57.114
Right.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.122
-Jess, we're gonna have to jump.
-I'm not jumping.

41:59.166 --> 42:02.203
-You got a better idea?
-Use the branch as a bridge.

42:02.726 --> 42:05.160
-lt does not look stable.
-lt looks fine.

42:05.206 --> 42:06.639
All right.

42:11.406 --> 42:13.283
Here goes. All right.

42:15.806 --> 42:17.398
lt's sinking and making noises.

42:17.446 --> 42:18.879
-Go faster.
-Okay!

42:19.966 --> 42:21.399
This is my grandma's car!

42:21.446 --> 42:24.199
I understand that.
Just give me your hand.

42:30.646 --> 42:33.399
You okay? Grab the branch!
Grab the branch!

42:59.726 --> 43:02.684
-Excuse you.
-You killed Petunia!

43:03.326 --> 43:07.035
Well... Yeah.

43:07.126 --> 43:11.278
My backpack! Don't just stand there.
Help me!

43:11.646 --> 43:13.637
Here. Here. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

43:13.686 --> 43:15.278
-Come on.
-I'm dead. I'm dead.

43:15.326 --> 43:16.964
I'm gonna die,
that's what's gonna happen,

43:17.006 --> 43:19.566
'cause my parents are gonna kill me.

43:19.606 --> 43:21.198
Why did I have to get in that stupid car
with you?

43:21.246 --> 43:23.555
-Answer your phone!
-Okay. Sorry.

43:26.446 --> 43:28.801
-Dad?
-Yeah... Son? Can you hear me?

43:29.446 --> 43:33.041
-Hello?
-We are a little worried over here and...

43:33.086 --> 43:34.201
Can you hear me?

43:35.606 --> 43:37.403
Dad? There's no signal.
Can you hear me?

43:38.126 --> 43:41.755
Christopher, come home, honey, okay?
Or call us.

43:42.246 --> 43:43.565
Do you... Hello?

43:44.646 --> 43:45.795
Hello?

43:53.046 --> 43:55.116
Look at this!

43:55.166 --> 43:56.997
When we get out of here,
you're paying for a new one.

43:57.046 --> 43:59.116
I'm paying for it right now.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.364
-Jess.
-What?

44:03.406 --> 44:04.475
Where are you going?

44:04.526 --> 44:07.836
To the beach where my sister
is probably freaking out right now.

44:08.006 --> 44:10.076
-Jess?
-What?

44:11.086 --> 44:12.519
Beach is that way.

44:22.166 --> 44:23.360
Please.

44:52.886 --> 44:55.036
Christopher John Wilde.

44:56.246 --> 44:59.397
Come on. Am I being Punk'd?

45:03.046 --> 45:05.879
-Hey, how you doing? You okay?
-Now you're concerned?

45:05.966 --> 45:07.240
You know, l've always been concerned.

45:07.286 --> 45:09.481
-Maybe you should stop.
-Why are you so grumpy?

45:09.526 --> 45:13.121
I'm not grumpy or cranky or crabby!
I just wanna get home to my family,

45:13.166 --> 45:15.999
explain why I disappeared,
and suffer the consequences.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.116
You want to know what I want?
I wanna have fun.

45:18.166 --> 45:20.680
Okay, for the first time in years,
there's no reporters,

45:20.726 --> 45:23.286
there's no interviews,
there's no crowds.

45:23.326 --> 45:27.399
I'm having a great time. I want you
to stop complaining so I can enjoy it!

45:27.446 --> 45:29.323
Wow, so that's what it's like with you?

45:29.366 --> 45:32.756
You don't get what you want so you
throw a big ol' tantrum and walk away?

45:32.806 --> 45:35.957
You know, I'll bet your friends
chase after you when you do that.

45:36.006 --> 45:39.316
Christopher, I'm so sorry
I hurt your delicate little feelings.

45:39.366 --> 45:41.118
Christopher, forgive me
for not treating you

45:41.166 --> 45:43.521
like the big enormous star
you think you are.

45:43.566 --> 45:45.477
What a brat.

45:45.526 --> 45:48.359
I'm a brat? I'm a brat?
What about you, huh?

45:48.566 --> 45:49.635
-Me?
-Yeah.

45:49.686 --> 45:51.836
Over the last two days,
l've done nothing but think about you.

45:51.886 --> 45:55.242
Really? So when you hit me
with a door twice,

45:55.286 --> 45:57.481
hid me in your house,
wrecked my grandma's car

45:57.526 --> 46:00.836
and dropped me in mud,
you were just being thoughtful?

46:01.046 --> 46:03.879
-l pity your friends.
-You wish you were one.

46:05.166 --> 46:07.441
l'd rather go down with Petunia.

46:11.366 --> 46:12.765
You know what,
I'm confused about something.

46:12.806 --> 46:13.955
What?

46:14.886 --> 46:17.320
Okay, when we were
on our little photography tour,

46:17.366 --> 46:19.834
-l thought you liked me.
-You thought wrong.

46:19.886 --> 46:22.241
But everyone likes me.
Why is it that you don't like me?

46:22.286 --> 46:24.675
Maybe because you think
everybody likes you.

46:24.726 --> 46:27.638
-lt's 'cause I'm likeable.
-No, because you're a star.

46:27.686 --> 46:31.395
-What does that mean?
-You don't even see it, do you?

46:32.806 --> 46:34.762
Your life isn't real.

46:34.806 --> 46:37.957
You park in no-parking zones,
you never have to wait in line,

46:38.006 --> 46:41.476
you buy anything you want, anytime.
Your house is like a hotel.

46:41.526 --> 46:43.994
You have so many people
working for you,

46:44.046 --> 46:46.924
and I'll bet
you don't even know their names.

46:46.966 --> 46:48.763
-Do, too.
-Name one.

46:49.126 --> 46:51.924
-Bob.
-You just made that up.

46:53.846 --> 46:56.679
Well, okay, Stubby knows everybody.
That's his job.

46:56.726 --> 47:00.514
See, that's not normal.
Okay, your best friend is your driver,

47:00.566 --> 47:02.841
your parents are on your payroll,
and your girlfriend...

47:02.886 --> 47:06.242
I mean, real people date someone
because they want to be with them.

47:06.286 --> 47:07.844
Why are you with Alexis?

47:12.006 --> 47:13.837
That's all I'm saying.

47:15.286 --> 47:18.801
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Wait. Stop. What...

47:18.846 --> 47:21.280
Are you saying I'm not a real person?
Because I am.

47:21.326 --> 47:23.157
I stand corrected.

47:24.526 --> 47:26.323
Well, all right. Well, what if I told you
something about me

47:26.366 --> 47:27.401
that no one else knew?

47:27.446 --> 47:29.118
You collect your toenails
in a peanut butter jar?

47:29.166 --> 47:31.441
-No. What... No.
-Then what?

47:31.486 --> 47:34.364
Well, from the first day I met you,
I just... Whoa!

47:34.686 --> 47:36.039
Christopher!

47:40.166 --> 47:42.919
-l can't swim.
-No.

47:47.646 --> 47:49.955
-Gotcha!
-What? You're evil.

47:50.006 --> 47:52.315
-You deserved it.
-You're so evil.

47:54.646 --> 47:57.206
-You're gonna get it.
-You can try.

47:57.246 --> 47:59.123
Get over here. No. Come on.

48:00.006 --> 48:01.917
-Got you.
-I'm gonna get you.

48:09.086 --> 48:11.441
-This is nice, isn't it?
-Man.

48:12.126 --> 48:14.765
I wish I could just stay here
where no one can find me.

48:14.806 --> 48:15.875
Why?

48:15.926 --> 48:18.156
'Cause they all want something
from me.

48:18.206 --> 48:21.243
A performance, or an interview,
or a photograph.

48:21.446 --> 48:24.483
-Even your parents?
-That's complicated.

48:25.366 --> 48:27.482
You know, sometimes I feel like
they only care about the business

48:27.526 --> 48:30.120
-of ''Christopher Wilde.''
-I'm sure that's not true.

48:30.166 --> 48:34.000
I don't know. I feel like all we talk
about right now is this movie deal.

48:34.046 --> 48:36.401
They think
it's my next big career move, so...

48:36.446 --> 48:37.925
Well, what do you think?

48:37.966 --> 48:39.718
Think if I get the offer, I have to take it.

48:39.766 --> 48:42.280
-What about your tour?
-What about it?

48:42.886 --> 48:46.765
Well, 30 countries, 1 2 weeks.

48:46.806 --> 48:49.036
One million screaming fans.

48:49.566 --> 48:52.524
I mean, I'm not an expert or anything,
but it seems like a lot,

48:52.566 --> 48:55.126
the tour and the movie
at the same time.

48:55.486 --> 48:56.805
I don't have a choice.

48:56.846 --> 48:59.644
Everyone has a choice.
What do you wanna do?

49:01.206 --> 49:02.480
Well, I know what I don't wanna do.

49:02.526 --> 49:04.835
I don't wanna disappoint anybody.
Especially my fans.

49:04.886 --> 49:06.842
I wouldn't be where I am
without them, so...

49:06.886 --> 49:09.878
I just never say no. To anything.

49:12.806 --> 49:14.762
Maybe I don't understand.

49:15.166 --> 49:17.282
-What?
-Your life.

49:17.326 --> 49:19.920
I mean, it's so different from mine.

49:19.966 --> 49:23.322
Everything you do and say
is so big and public.

49:24.366 --> 49:25.879
Not everything.

49:26.566 --> 49:30.525
Right now, here with you,
I feel like I can just be myself.

49:31.326 --> 49:36.878
Not Christopher Wilde. Not famous.
Just... You know, just me.

49:38.046 --> 49:40.640
-How do you like it?
-l like it a lot.

49:43.206 --> 49:44.434
Me, too.

49:45.926 --> 49:47.996
So tell me something about you.

49:48.046 --> 49:50.560
-What do you wanna know?
-Everything.

49:51.286 --> 49:54.562
That could take a while.
I live a very exciting life.

49:59.326 --> 50:01.123
You're doing it again.

50:01.406 --> 50:04.000
-Doing what?
-That thing with your eyes.

50:04.486 --> 50:06.044
You mean this?

50:07.566 --> 50:09.841
Okay, so comedy?
Not your next big career move.

50:09.886 --> 50:11.604
What? No, I'm funny.

50:11.806 --> 50:14.195
-Funny-looking.
-You like me.

50:14.646 --> 50:15.999
You wish.

50:23.046 --> 50:24.479
We should go.

50:29.566 --> 50:32.683
Yeah. Come on.

50:48.366 --> 50:49.560
Stubby?

50:49.846 --> 50:53.236
Whoa. Sara?
What are you doing here?

50:55.806 --> 50:57.444
That's not good.

50:59.966 --> 51:02.958
-We made it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

51:05.246 --> 51:08.875
-Look, I had a really great time today.
-Me, too.

51:09.726 --> 51:12.957
You're so different from any other girl
l've ever known.

51:13.006 --> 51:17.477
-Different weird, different annoying?
-Different surprising.

51:19.166 --> 51:20.838
In the best way.

51:22.166 --> 51:25.636
I mean, you say things to me
everyone else is afraid to say,

51:26.366 --> 51:29.881
and you make me see things
about myself that I can't see.

51:30.886 --> 51:33.605
-You're pretty surprising, too.
-Really? How?

51:33.966 --> 51:36.321
Well, for one thing,
you're a terrible driver,

51:36.366 --> 51:38.675
which is strange for a guy with six cars.

51:38.726 --> 51:40.125
I'm wounded.

51:42.326 --> 51:44.886
Do you really think I'm bossy?

51:45.246 --> 51:47.999
No. I think you're amazing.

51:49.726 --> 51:51.842
I think you're amazing, too.

52:01.486 --> 52:03.204
What are you doing?

52:05.526 --> 52:07.005
That was close.

52:08.366 --> 52:12.803
Okay. Back to the real world.
You know what happens next, right?

52:13.926 --> 52:16.076
-No.
-This ends here.

52:17.006 --> 52:19.440
-What does?
-This. Us.

52:19.646 --> 52:21.159
You can't tell anybody
about what happened today.

52:21.206 --> 52:22.844
Not even your parents.

52:22.886 --> 52:25.116
Why? They're not gonna go post it
on their blog or anything.

52:25.166 --> 52:28.841
Look, if we go down there, if we get
photographed together, it'll get crazy.

52:28.886 --> 52:31.764
-And I won't get this movie deal.
-Why does it have to get crazy?

52:31.806 --> 52:35.401
Because I'm Christopher Wilde.
You're just an ordinary girl.

52:37.286 --> 52:38.878
I have to go now.

52:39.526 --> 52:43.565
Wait, Jess! Jess! Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. What just happened?

52:44.006 --> 52:46.440
You tell me. One second I'm amazing

52:46.486 --> 52:48.795
and the next you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?

52:48.846 --> 52:51.519
-Jess, I'm not embarrassed...
-Really?

52:51.566 --> 52:53.875
lf I was Alexis Bender,
you'd rush right down there

52:53.926 --> 52:56.565
and make sure
somebody took our picture.

52:56.606 --> 52:59.962
-But, no, I'm just an ordinary girl!
-That is not what I meant.

53:00.006 --> 53:03.442
Look, I meant you're normal.
I want you to stay that way.

53:04.086 --> 53:06.680
Right. Just leave me alone.

53:06.966 --> 53:08.797
Jess. Stop. Please.

53:10.606 --> 53:11.675
What?

53:12.966 --> 53:17.960
The pictures you took. Of us.
I should probably keep them.

53:18.726 --> 53:22.275
-You want my camera?
-Just in case.

53:23.486 --> 53:26.637
I wouldn't want the pictures to,
you know, get out.

53:27.406 --> 53:29.920
Fine. You want my pictures? Here.

53:29.966 --> 53:32.719
There's nothing
l'd wanna remember anyway.

53:42.406 --> 53:44.476
I need cab fare to get home.

53:50.366 --> 53:53.403
-I'm going to Hollywood, not Hawaii.
-Just keep it.

53:53.446 --> 53:56.961
I still owe you for my stay
at Garage de la Grandma.

53:57.606 --> 54:01.155
Jess, wait.
I don't wanna say goodbye like this.

54:01.766 --> 54:03.358
Okay, how about this?

54:03.406 --> 54:05.874
How about we both forget
this whole day ever happened?

54:05.926 --> 54:09.441
You won't talk about me
and I promise I won't talk about you.

54:09.486 --> 54:12.319
Go ahead and judge me, okay,
but you don't know what it'll be like.

54:12.366 --> 54:15.244
The paparazzi never go away.
And once they have you in their sights,

54:15.286 --> 54:17.117
they won't quit
until they get what they want.

54:17.166 --> 54:20.636
And when they finally get it,
they'll turn it into something ugly.

54:20.686 --> 54:22.244
They'll ruin everything.

54:22.566 --> 54:25.603
They don't have to. You already did.

54:36.286 --> 54:41.314
I'm no superman
I can't take your hand

54:41.366 --> 54:46.315
And fly you anywhere
you wanna go, yeah

54:46.726 --> 54:51.880
I can't read your mind
Like a billboard sign

54:51.926 --> 54:55.680
And tell you everything
you wanna hear

54:55.726 --> 55:01.323
But I'll be your hero

55:01.366 --> 55:06.235
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

55:06.286 --> 55:07.878
If you're the one for me

55:07.926 --> 55:11.760
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

55:11.806 --> 55:15.845
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

55:15.886 --> 55:21.085
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

55:21.326 --> 55:25.035
But if you're the one for me

55:25.086 --> 55:27.316
Then I'll be your hero

55:27.606 --> 55:30.245
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me?

55:30.286 --> 55:31.514
Then I'll be your hero

55:31.566 --> 55:33.921
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

55:33.966 --> 55:35.194
Could you be the one for me?

55:35.246 --> 55:36.964
Then I'll be your hero

55:37.006 --> 55:41.682
Searching high and low
Trying every road

55:42.006 --> 55:46.522
But if I see your face
how will I know, yeah

55:46.846 --> 55:51.840
I'll put my trust in fate
That you will come my way

55:51.966 --> 55:56.323
And if it's right, it's undeniable, yeah

55:56.366 --> 56:01.360
I'll be your hero

56:01.406 --> 56:05.445
I, I can be everything you need

56:05.486 --> 56:07.204
If you're the one for me

56:07.246 --> 56:11.159
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

56:11.206 --> 56:15.438
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

56:15.486 --> 56:20.560
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

56:20.806 --> 56:24.355
But if you're the one for me

56:24.406 --> 56:26.078
Then I'll be your hero

56:26.166 --> 56:28.361
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

56:28.406 --> 56:29.725
Could you be the one for me?

56:29.766 --> 56:31.040
I'll be your hero

56:31.086 --> 56:33.281
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

56:33.326 --> 56:34.600
Could you be the one for me?

56:34.646 --> 56:36.523
I'll be your hero

56:36.566 --> 56:41.162
So incredible
Some kind of miracle

56:41.206 --> 56:43.197
That when it's meant to be

56:43.246 --> 56:47.364
I'll become a hero, oh

56:47.406 --> 56:53.879
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you

56:54.366 --> 56:57.278
Yeah, I'll be your hero

57:00.766 --> 57:04.918
I, I could be everything you need

57:04.966 --> 57:06.718
If you're the one for me

57:06.766 --> 57:09.758
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

57:10.806 --> 57:14.799
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

57:14.846 --> 57:20.318
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

57:20.366 --> 57:24.120
But if you're the one for me

57:24.166 --> 57:25.519
Then I'll be your hero

57:25.566 --> 57:27.682
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

57:27.726 --> 57:29.079
Could you be the one for me?

57:29.126 --> 57:31.515
Then I'll be your hero

57:31.566 --> 57:34.034
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me?

57:34.086 --> 57:36.725
Then I'll be your hero

57:37.566 --> 57:39.158
That was great, Chris. Take five.

57:39.206 --> 57:42.164
Thanks, guys. That was great.
Let's take a break.

57:42.206 --> 57:43.434
All right, man.

57:46.206 --> 57:49.118
-Good job, guys. Yeah.
-Hey, wait up.

57:59.526 --> 58:01.960
Yo. You okay?

58:03.046 --> 58:06.402
Yeah. Yeah,
I just can't get her out of my mind.

58:07.246 --> 58:11.205
Yeah, me neither.
She cacked all over my shoes.

58:14.526 --> 58:16.642
I mean, she's real, you know?

58:16.686 --> 58:21.282
She's annoyingly honest, she's smart,
she's cool, she's funny, she's beautiful.

58:21.326 --> 58:22.395
Yeah.

58:22.846 --> 58:24.325
Hello, boys.

58:25.646 --> 58:27.238
Talking about me?

58:29.406 --> 58:30.521
Dude.

58:32.806 --> 58:35.718
-Look, Alexis, I can explain...
-l don't want to know who she is.

58:36.086 --> 58:38.884
ls she an actress?
ls she more famous than me?

58:38.926 --> 58:42.316
No. No, she's not an actress.
She's not famous at all.

58:42.726 --> 58:45.798
Then I really don't understand
why you would pick her.

58:45.846 --> 58:48.314
I didn't pick her.
lt just kind of happened.

58:48.366 --> 58:51.802
Silly. That kind of stuff
only happens in the movies.

58:51.846 --> 58:53.359
This is the real world.

58:55.846 --> 58:58.599
I have a date with Zac. I have to go.

58:58.806 --> 59:01.604
Whoa. Are you breaking up with me?

59:03.486 --> 59:04.635
Okay.

59:05.526 --> 59:07.676
-Friends?
-Sure.

59:26.326 --> 59:30.319
-Bye, Grandma. I love you.
-Goodbye, Sara. I love you more.

59:31.526 --> 59:34.086
-You sure you're gonna be okay, Mom?
-Yes, Barbara.

59:34.126 --> 59:36.924
And you mustn't believe
what you read about old folks.

59:36.966 --> 59:40.959
-Howard and I are gonna be just fine.
-l can see that.

59:41.606 --> 59:43.836
-Love you.
-Love you. Love you.

59:47.006 --> 59:50.203
And how about you, Jess?
Are you gonna be all right?

59:50.966 --> 59:54.436
Sweetheart. I know it hurts right now,

59:55.606 --> 59:59.315
but things are not always
what they seem in the moment.

59:59.366 --> 01:00:03.564
Given some time, life has a way
of working itself out for the better.

01:00:04.046 --> 01:00:07.118
-Really, Grandma?
-Yup. I mean, look at me.

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:11.596
l've been trying to get rid of that ugly
old car since your grandpa died.

01:00:11.766 --> 01:00:14.200
-Honey.
-l love you, Grandma.

01:00:14.246 --> 01:00:16.202
I love you, sweetheart.

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:22.237
-Bye, Howard.
-Take care, sweetheart.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.514
You, too.

01:00:24.766 --> 01:00:26.563
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

01:00:30.606 --> 01:00:32.119
Bye, everybody!

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:38.240
Jessica Olson.

01:00:39.246 --> 01:00:43.159
-Such a nice name for a nice girl.
-Where'd you get that?

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.844
Where do you think I got it,
Christopher?

01:00:44.886 --> 01:00:47.605
Libby Lam has had a whole fleet
of photographers on you

01:00:47.646 --> 01:00:51.002
-for the past two days.
-l know, but I was so careful.

01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:54.595
Now, this is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid of with you, kid.

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:57.240
I mean, you're obviously not serious
about doing this movie.

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.685
I don't know,
maybe you're just too young.

01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:01.877
No, sir. Look, I made a mistake.

01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:05.965
Come on, Alan.
Give us a chance to fix this.

01:01:09.526 --> 01:01:13.201
All right, all right.
Make the story go away.

01:01:13.646 --> 01:01:16.114
-How do we do that?
-You call Libby Lam.

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:19.476
You offer her an exclusive.
You say you don't know this girl.

01:01:19.526 --> 01:01:23.041
You say she's just some fan
who was following you around all day.

01:01:23.086 --> 01:01:25.475
-You want me to lie?
-Christopher!

01:01:25.526 --> 01:01:29.201
This is the tabloid press, dude.
This is not the Supreme Court.

01:01:29.246 --> 01:01:30.838
Say whatever you have to say,

01:01:30.886 --> 01:01:36.722
because I promise you, either this girl
goes away or the movie does. Okay?

01:01:41.686 --> 01:01:42.914
Goodbye.

01:01:46.406 --> 01:01:50.922
So we're talking about this girl,
Jessica Olson.

01:01:52.406 --> 01:01:55.637
-Yeah, she looks kind of familiar.
-Come on, Christopher.

01:01:55.686 --> 01:01:57.563
We know you were at the beach
with her.

01:01:57.606 --> 01:02:00.484
Look, lots of fans come to Malibu
to watch me surf,

01:02:00.526 --> 01:02:03.484
and I try to say hi to everybody
that comes up to me, but...

01:02:03.926 --> 01:02:04.995
Please.

01:02:05.046 --> 01:02:07.162
Maybe I signed an autograph for her
or something.

01:02:07.246 --> 01:02:09.043
Excuse us. lt's okay.

01:02:09.086 --> 01:02:10.280
According to our sources,

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.920
she came all the way from Kalamazoo,
Michigan, just to see you.

01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:15.639
-Coming through. Enough of that.
-Wow, really?

01:02:15.686 --> 01:02:17.165
I'm sorry
I didn't get the chance to meet her.

01:02:17.206 --> 01:02:18.434
Going inside.

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:24.123
You have to talk to us, Jess.

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:26.122
What happened out there in California?

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:28.043
Nothing bad, I promise.

01:02:28.086 --> 01:02:31.965
I can't talk about it.
Please, please, just trust me.

01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:36.642
Christopher Wilde
is talking about you on Starstruck!

01:02:37.366 --> 01:02:41.075
So you're saying
that you don't know this girl.

01:02:41.646 --> 01:02:44.922
Yeah. I mean, I don't know
what she's saying about me,

01:02:44.966 --> 01:02:47.844
but I don't know anybody
named Jessica Olson.

01:02:47.886 --> 01:02:50.684
Sorry, Libby,
there's nothing more to tell.

01:02:51.086 --> 01:02:53.884
Okay. You heard it here first.

01:02:53.926 --> 01:02:56.565
I'm Libby Lam. This is Starstruck News.

01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:05.640
I can't believe they're still out there.
Why don't they just go home?

01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:08.923
Because they haven't got
what they came for yet.

01:03:09.526 --> 01:03:11.835
You know,
you should just go talk to them.

01:03:11.886 --> 01:03:14.605
I mean,
you're already all over the lnternet.

01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:16.602
-l am?
-Yeah!

01:03:16.886 --> 01:03:21.243
There's like a whole website devoted
to what people think about Chrissica.

01:03:21.326 --> 01:03:22.839
''Chrissica''?

01:03:27.606 --> 01:03:31.599
Wow.
You really shouldn't read any of these.

01:03:32.766 --> 01:03:34.996
Wait, wait, here's a good one.

01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:39.035
''That Jessica Olson chick
is a real nut, dude.

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:43.443
''She just wants to be famous.
She should get a life because she...''

01:03:57.526 --> 01:03:59.323
Guys, stop. Just stop.

01:04:00.846 --> 01:04:04.555
Maybe it's the phrasing or the tempo.
Something's not right.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.958
-Yo, what's up with you, man?
-l don't know.

01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:14.039
You want to know what I think?
Sure you do.

01:04:14.246 --> 01:04:16.316
I think you're still torn up about Jessica.

01:04:16.366 --> 01:04:18.402
No. I'm good. I'm over her.

01:04:26.926 --> 01:04:29.804
All my life people telling me
just who I am

01:04:29.846 --> 01:04:32.644
They don't wanna know
They don't really understand

01:04:32.686 --> 01:04:35.359
Too many people trying to tell me
to be practical

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:38.557
Only think that I am one-dimensional

01:04:38.606 --> 01:04:41.678
But I can feel it
There's a fire raging underneath

01:04:41.726 --> 01:04:44.445
Burning through the pages
here I am coming clean

01:04:44.486 --> 01:04:47.319
I'm sick of lying to myself
Gotta live the truth

01:04:47.366 --> 01:04:50.915
Now I gotta do what I gotta do

01:04:50.966 --> 01:04:54.197
This is where I should be

01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:56.806
There ain't no other place, yeah

01:04:56.846 --> 01:05:00.043
Where my soul really speaks

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:01.838
There ain't no other way

01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:05.276
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

01:05:05.326 --> 01:05:08.602
Gotta go where the music takes me

01:05:08.726 --> 01:05:12.355
Let it set me free

01:05:12.406 --> 01:05:15.318
You got to believe

01:05:20.206 --> 01:05:23.084
Is it a crime to just be who I wanna be?

01:05:23.126 --> 01:05:26.163
I need some space
so that I can chase all my dreams

01:05:26.206 --> 01:05:28.879
'Cause when I hit the stage
anything is possible

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:31.998
I get lost in the song
and that is magical

01:05:32.046 --> 01:05:34.958
So crank it up, feel the rush
then just turn me loose

01:05:35.006 --> 01:05:37.884
I wanna feel the inspiration
that is coming through

01:05:37.926 --> 01:05:40.884
And there's no other place
where I feel so alive

01:05:40.926 --> 01:05:44.441
When I start to sing you just can't deny

01:05:44.486 --> 01:05:47.603
This is where I should be

01:05:47.646 --> 01:05:50.365
There ain't no other place, yeah

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:53.478
Where my soul really speaks

01:05:53.526 --> 01:05:55.357
There ain't no other way

01:05:55.406 --> 01:05:58.716
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

01:05:58.766 --> 01:06:02.202
Gotta go where the music takes me

01:06:02.246 --> 01:06:05.875
Let it set me free

01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:08.645
You got to believe

01:06:08.686 --> 01:06:11.598
When everybody's gone

01:06:11.646 --> 01:06:14.638
And I'm here all alone

01:06:14.686 --> 01:06:17.359
I don't gotta hide
I don't have to try

01:06:17.486 --> 01:06:20.284
You got to understand

01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:23.916
That this is who I am

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:27.203
And it's where I shine

01:06:27.246 --> 01:06:31.956
And it's where I shine, I know

01:06:32.086 --> 01:06:35.283
This is where I should be

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:37.965
There ain't no other place, yeah

01:06:38.006 --> 01:06:41.203
Where my soul really speaks

01:06:41.246 --> 01:06:42.998
There ain't no other way

01:06:43.046 --> 01:06:46.356
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:49.796
Gotta go where the music takes me

01:06:49.846 --> 01:06:53.441
Let it set me free

01:06:53.486 --> 01:06:55.841
You got to believe

01:06:55.886 --> 01:06:59.037
This is where I should be

01:06:59.086 --> 01:07:01.725
There ain't no other place, yeah

01:07:01.766 --> 01:07:04.917
Where my soul really speaks

01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:06.638
There ain't no other way

01:07:06.686 --> 01:07:10.235
I can feel it move me

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:13.523
Gotta go where the music takes me

01:07:13.566 --> 01:07:17.115
Let it set me free

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.441
Let it set me free

01:07:19.486 --> 01:07:23.161
Let it set me free

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.084
You got to believe

01:07:36.646 --> 01:07:38.921
You are definitely not over her.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:50.715
-Okay, they need to go now.
-l thought you liked being on TV.

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:55.157
Yeah, but I need to buy a dress for
the dance, and they're blocking my car.

01:07:55.206 --> 01:07:59.119
Christopher said this would happen.
He said it would get crazy.

01:08:00.886 --> 01:08:04.117
Celebrities might have to
put up with this, but I don't.

01:08:06.246 --> 01:08:07.645
Jessica! Jessica.

01:08:07.686 --> 01:08:10.246
Tell us about your weekend
with Christopher Wilde.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.799
We only want the truth.

01:08:11.846 --> 01:08:15.122
You don't want the truth.
You want a story.

01:08:15.486 --> 01:08:17.203
You take a good, normal person

01:08:17.246 --> 01:08:20.443
and turn him into
your own little reality show.

01:08:20.486 --> 01:08:22.363
You build him up into a big celebrity

01:08:22.406 --> 01:08:25.318
just so you can tear him down
in public.

01:08:25.366 --> 01:08:28.756
Just so you can sell magazines
and TV shows?

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.603
That's really sick.

01:08:31.526 --> 01:08:34.198
And Christopher Wilde's
just one example.

01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:37.283
He's talented and successful.

01:08:37.326 --> 01:08:40.443
He has all the stuff
lots of kids dream of having.

01:08:40.486 --> 01:08:44.604
But thanks to you, he's had to give up
some of the best things in life.

01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:47.365
Freedom. Privacy.

01:08:49.566 --> 01:08:50.999
Honesty.

01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:55.323
So, congratulations,
you've created a celebrity.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:58.997
But you have wrecked
the human being inside.

01:08:59.286 --> 01:09:01.720
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

01:09:03.286 --> 01:09:04.765
Did you get that?

01:09:04.805 --> 01:09:07.194
Jessica. Jessica,
just one more question.

01:09:07.246 --> 01:09:10.841
In your opinion,
who is Christopher Wilde, really?

01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:17.115
Who is he? I don't know.

01:09:18.566 --> 01:09:21.876
The Christopher Wilde
you're all so obsessed with,

01:09:24.685 --> 01:09:29.237
I promise you, I never met him,
and I wouldn't want to.

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:36.442
Didn't you say you liked her
because she was so honest?

01:09:36.486 --> 01:09:37.919
-Yeah.
-Wow.

01:09:39.366 --> 01:09:43.359
Congratulations, Chris. You did it.
You got her to lie for you.

01:09:43.406 --> 01:09:45.555
I didn't have a choice, okay?

01:09:47.886 --> 01:09:49.285
All right.

01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:51.602
-Where are you going?
-To find my best friend,

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.921
'cause he's not the guy
sitting here now.

01:09:53.966 --> 01:09:57.242
-Dude, what are you talking about?
-''l didn't have a choice.''

01:09:57.286 --> 01:10:00.403
Lately that's been your answer
to everything, man.

01:10:01.926 --> 01:10:03.678
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:10:04.566 --> 01:10:08.445
Your life, your choice, man.
What do you want?

01:10:21.006 --> 01:10:22.041
Cut!

01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:27.517
Guys, you nailed it. Perfect, guys.

01:10:27.566 --> 01:10:31.195
That was the one. That was perfect.
Let's go one more time.

01:10:31.246 --> 01:10:35.558
Circle. Great take. Great... Christopher!

01:10:35.766 --> 01:10:39.202
Buddy. Great news. You're in.
Rehearsals start on Monday.

01:10:40.006 --> 01:10:43.043
-Actually, I'm not available.
-Not a problem. We'll change the date.

01:10:43.086 --> 01:10:45.236
No. I came to say, you know,
thanks for the offer,

01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:49.245
but if I have to lie to be
in your little club, think I'll pass.

01:10:54.326 --> 01:10:58.604
Wow. Kid's got edge. Fire. I like that.

01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:02.238
And cue the rain!

01:11:15.126 --> 01:11:17.924
Okay. He's got two weeks
between Oslo and London.

01:11:17.966 --> 01:11:20.116
We could make him available
for the movie then.

01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:23.317
That's tight.
You know, he needs some downtime.

01:11:24.726 --> 01:11:29.117
Okay. All right. How about after Tokyo,
but before Melbourne?

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:30.685
-What's going on?
-Hi, honey.

01:11:30.726 --> 01:11:31.841
Hey.

01:11:31.886 --> 01:11:35.003
We're working the movie
into your tour schedule.

01:11:40.246 --> 01:11:42.840
I don't want to do the movie any more.

01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:44.604
Sweetie, don't be silly.
Of course you do.

01:11:44.646 --> 01:11:46.796
We're about to make the deal, bud.

01:11:46.846 --> 01:11:49.565
Well, it's too late. l've already passed.

01:11:50.686 --> 01:11:52.961
Honey, that's not your decision.

01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:55.039
Yes, it is.

01:11:55.806 --> 01:11:59.435
I'm 1 7 years old.
I just want to have fun and make music.

01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:02.956
Okay, okay. Hey. No worries.
No worries. We'll handle it.

01:12:03.006 --> 01:12:07.955
No. No. lt's time that I started
managing my own life. So...

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:12.437
You know what? You're fired.

01:12:13.926 --> 01:12:15.041
Wow.

01:12:15.086 --> 01:12:18.681
l'd really like for you
to just be my parents from now on.

01:12:30.326 --> 01:12:31.475
Right.

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:35.158
Okay, come here.

01:12:37.246 --> 01:12:38.315
Turn.

01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:43.717
lt's just not girly enough.

01:12:43.886 --> 01:12:47.435
But imagine it on me. Girlier, right?

01:12:48.606 --> 01:12:52.121
-Maybe.
-Why don't you just try it on yourself?

01:12:52.526 --> 01:12:54.721
Stop whining. Here.

01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:58.198
We have three hours before the dance.
Go change.

01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:01.161
Kids!

01:13:01.286 --> 01:13:04.084
So what was it like
to have reporters on your lawn?

01:13:04.126 --> 01:13:07.038
Exciting. But I need my privacy, too.

01:13:07.606 --> 01:13:11.599
We all watched your sister on TV,
and she looked wacko.

01:13:12.046 --> 01:13:13.365
-Really?
-Yeah!

01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:15.442
lt was so weird
the way she made up that story

01:13:15.486 --> 01:13:19.718
about meeting Christopher Wilde.
She is so pathetic.

01:13:24.206 --> 01:13:26.162
Do you think she heard that?

01:13:26.206 --> 01:13:28.561
-AJ. You're an idiot.
-What?

01:13:28.606 --> 01:13:29.675
-Get out.
-But...

01:13:29.726 --> 01:13:30.761
Go!

01:13:34.846 --> 01:13:36.916
-Jessica.
-Go away.

01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:41.636
No. I actually live here.

01:13:42.806 --> 01:13:43.921
What?

01:13:45.726 --> 01:13:47.876
Go with me to the dance.

01:13:48.566 --> 01:13:51.285
I thought I was pathetic
and embarrassing.

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:55.721
Only if you actually dance. So don't.

01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:58.963
Come on. Come on.

01:13:59.566 --> 01:14:02.444
Let's make you pretty enough
to be my sister.

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:27.518
You look good. Don't slouch.

01:14:30.246 --> 01:14:33.682
You know, Sara, in a weird way,
you're a good sister.

01:14:36.006 --> 01:14:38.076
Pretend you don't know me.

01:14:56.606 --> 01:14:57.925
Lame.

01:15:03.086 --> 01:15:05.042
Oh, my God!

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:10.519
Jessica Olson?

01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:24.755
There's some things I forgot to say
to you back in California.

01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:36.884
Can't blame you

01:15:36.926 --> 01:15:38.598
For thinking

01:15:38.646 --> 01:15:42.605
That you never really knew me at all

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.919
I tried to

01:15:47.966 --> 01:15:49.922
Deny you

01:15:49.966 --> 01:15:54.482
But nothing ever
made me feel so wrong

01:15:55.326 --> 01:16:00.844
I thought I was protecting you
from everything that I go through

01:16:00.886 --> 01:16:05.721
But I know that we got lost
along the way

01:16:06.606 --> 01:16:08.756
Here I am

01:16:08.806 --> 01:16:11.525
With all my heart

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:14.797
I hope you understand

01:16:14.846 --> 01:16:17.360
I hope you understand

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:21.115
I know I let you down

01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:27.321
But I'm never gonna make
that mistake again

01:16:28.846 --> 01:16:34.045
You brought me closer
to who I really am

01:16:34.206 --> 01:16:37.118
So come take my hand

01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:39.361
I want the world to see

01:16:39.406 --> 01:16:41.966
What you mean to me

01:16:44.846 --> 01:16:48.122
What you mean to me

01:16:54.966 --> 01:16:56.319
What did you think?

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:57.685
That you could just come here
and sing to me

01:16:57.726 --> 01:16:59.796
and everything would be fine?

01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:04.841
Yes. No? No. No.

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.804
Well, which is it?

01:17:07.446 --> 01:17:11.121
I just came to tell you
I was wrong about everything,

01:17:12.046 --> 01:17:13.764
especially about you.

01:17:14.966 --> 01:17:17.321
-Don't you think you're a little late?
-Come on.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:20.278
Everyone here thinks I was lying.

01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:22.317
But I'm the one who lied.

01:17:28.846 --> 01:17:31.644
I lied about knowing Jessica Olson.

01:17:31.686 --> 01:17:33.995
'Cause the truth is
I know Jessica Olson.

01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:37.755
Jessica Olson's a terrible navigator
and a know-it-all,

01:17:37.806 --> 01:17:39.034
but she's honest.

01:17:39.086 --> 01:17:41.202
When she makes a promise,
she keeps it.

01:17:41.246 --> 01:17:43.965
She understands me
like no one else does.

01:17:45.766 --> 01:17:47.757
And I'm crazy about her.

01:17:48.886 --> 01:17:51.525
Jessica, I'm so sorry.
I know that I hurt you

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:54.524
and I will never do
anything like that again.

01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:57.603
Just, please, forgive me.

01:18:10.766 --> 01:18:14.964
-Go away. Now.
-Okay. Get out of here. Move it.

01:18:26.326 --> 01:18:30.524
Christopher, this is my sister, Sara.
Sara, this is Christopher Wilde.

01:18:30.566 --> 01:18:33.922
Sara. Do you wanna dance with me?

01:18:37.206 --> 01:18:39.515
I think I got this one, Chrissy.

01:18:42.126 --> 01:18:44.401
You didn't have to come
all the way to Michigan for this.

01:18:44.446 --> 01:18:45.959
Yeah, I did.

01:18:46.006 --> 01:18:47.485
lt's not cool
to ask a girl out on the phone.

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:54.035
So, will you go out with me?
On a real date.

01:18:54.606 --> 01:18:58.235
