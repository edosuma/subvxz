38:16.833 --> 38:18.467
AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.

38:18.467 --> 38:21.800
I'M DONE.

38:18.467 --> 38:21.800
NO MORE SéANCE FOR ME.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.967
THIS IS CRAZY.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.500
I HAVE NO DESIRE

38:22.967 --> 38:25.500
TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.600
AT THAT POINT, I'M KIND

38:25.500 --> 38:27.600
OF FIGHT OR FLIGHT,

38:27.600 --> 38:30.967
AND I WANT TO GET

38:27.600 --> 38:30.967
OUT OF THERE.

38:30.967 --> 38:34.800
MY HEART HAS DROPPED,

38:30.967 --> 38:34.800
SUNK RIGHT INTO MY STOMACH.

38:34.800 --> 38:38.067
I AM SO GENUINELY AFRAID.

38:38.067 --> 38:41.333
MY ADRENALINE IS SPIKING

38:38.067 --> 38:41.333
THROUGH THE ROOF.

38:41.333 --> 38:46.233
I THINK, "WELL, IF THERE<i>IS</i>

38:41.333 --> 38:46.233
A GHOST, IT DOESN'T<i>LIKE</i>US."

38:46.233 --> 38:47.967
IT'S A WAY OF SAYING, "GET OUT."

38:47.967 --> 38:50.333
-OH, MY GOD.

38:47.967 --> 38:50.333
-THAT'S HOW I TOOK IT.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.767
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

38:50.333 --> 38:52.767
HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

38:52.767 --> 38:53.867
I LOOK OVER AT ASHLEY.

38:53.867 --> 38:56.067
SHE'S COMPLETELY PALE.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.933

OH, MY GOD. [ GASPS ]

39:01.967 --> 39:04.833

Jess: IT SEEMS THAT WHATEVER IS

39:04.833 --> 39:08.100
DOWN THERE IS VERY ANGRY.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.367
I WANT TO GO.

39:09.367 --> 39:12.067
NO ONE IS WANTING TO STAY

39:09.367 --> 39:12.067
AND INVESTIGATE.

39:12.067 --> 39:14.733
NO ONE IS WANTING

39:12.067 --> 39:14.733
TO CONTINUE TO TRY

39:14.733 --> 39:17.067
TO MAKE CONTACT

39:14.733 --> 39:17.067
WITH THE SPIRIT.

39:17.067 --> 39:19.467
Ashley:

39:17.067 --> 39:19.467
EVERYBODY IS TERRIFIED.

39:19.467 --> 39:22.067
EVERYBODY WANTS TO LEAVE.

39:25.900 --> 39:28.800
I AM NOW DOWN THERE WITH JUST

39:25.900 --> 39:28.800
ONE OTHER PERSON,

39:28.800 --> 39:32.733
AND HE GIVES MY LEG

39:28.800 --> 39:32.733
A BOOST, PUSHES ME UP.

39:36.067 --> 39:39.067
NONE OF US HAVE HAD TROUBLE

39:36.067 --> 39:39.067
GETTING OUT SO FAR.

39:39.067 --> 39:40.233
SHE'S ABOUT HALFWAY OUT.

39:40.233 --> 39:41.633
SHE'S GOT HER FOOT ON A LEDGE,

39:41.633 --> 39:44.233
AND SHE'S ABOUT TO PROPEL

39:41.633 --> 39:44.233
HERSELF OUT OF THE HOLE.

39:44.233 --> 39:45.500
HERE, TAKE MY HAND.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.433
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER.

39:47.433 --> 39:49.867
TAKE MY HAND.

39:49.867 --> 39:51.867
I'VE GOT YOU.

39:49.867 --> 39:51.867
THERE WE GO.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.600
I GOT YOU.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.933
I GOT YOU.

39:55.933 --> 39:58.467
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS FORCE,

39:58.467 --> 40:00.133
IT'S ALMOST

39:58.467 --> 40:00.133
LIKE A SUCTION FORCE,

40:00.133 --> 40:03.233
LIKE YOU'RE BEING PULLED

40:00.133 --> 40:03.233
DOWN TO THE GROUND,

40:03.233 --> 40:04.867
JUST PULLS MY ENTIRE BODY.

40:04.867 --> 40:06.033
THERE'S SOMETHING PULLING ME.

40:06.033 --> 40:08.133
I CAN'T GET OUT.

40:08.133 --> 40:10.833
IT ALMOST FELT LIKE

40:08.133 --> 40:10.833
IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND UP

40:10.833 --> 40:13.067
TO THE SUCTION

40:10.833 --> 40:13.067
OF A VACUUM CLEANER,

HOW THERE'S SUCH

40:13.067 --> 40:15.233
A TREMENDOUS FORCE

40:15.233 --> 40:17.367
THAT PULLS YOUR HAND TOWARD IT.

40:17.367 --> 40:20.633
IT FELT LIKE THAT BUT

40:17.367 --> 40:20.633
FOR MY WHOLE BODY.

40:20.633 --> 40:23.433
-PLEASE!

40:20.633 --> 40:23.433
-A LITTLE MORE.

40:23.433 --> 40:26.667
I GOT YOU.

40:26.667 --> 40:30.533
AH!

40:30.533 --> 40:34.700
AND SHE JUST FALLS TO THE

40:30.533 --> 40:34.700
GROUND, JUST FALLS.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.333
LIKE, THERE WAS NO WARNING.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.367
IT WASN'T LIKE, "OOH,

40:36.333 --> 40:38.367
I THINK YOU'RE SLIPPING."

40:38.367 --> 40:41.367
IT WAS, "SHE'S ON THE GROUND."

40:41.367 --> 40:42.400
JESS.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.767
I'M CRYING, PART OF IT IN PAIN,

40:43.767 --> 40:46.033
BUT PART OF IT JUST BECAUSE

40:43.767 --> 40:46.033
I'M SO TERRIFIED,

40:46.033 --> 40:49.600
THINKING THAT, LIKE, I MIGHT NOT

40:46.033 --> 40:49.600
BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

Ashley:

40:54.800 --> 40:58.333
THERE'S NO REASON I CAN THINK OF

40:54.800 --> 40:58.333
THAT JESSICA WOULD HAVE FALLEN.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.667
WE HAD A GREAT GRIP ON HER.

40:59.667 --> 41:02.433
SHE WASN'T HAVING ANY

40:59.667 --> 41:02.433
TROUBLE GETTING OUT,

41:02.433 --> 41:07.067
SO I'M TERRIFIED THAT

41:02.433 --> 41:07.067
THIS GHOST IS BACK FOR MORE.

41:07.067 --> 41:09.100
JESS, ARE YOU THERE?

41:09.100 --> 41:11.633
WE JUST NEED TO GET HER OUT.

41:11.633 --> 41:14.167
JESS?

41:16.500 --> 41:19.567
I THINK THAT SOME SORT OF ENERGY

41:16.500 --> 41:19.567
OR SOME SORT OF FORCE

41:19.567 --> 41:21.400
IS TRYING TO KEEP ME DOWN THERE.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.967
COME ON, JESS.

41:22.967 --> 41:24.667
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

41:24.667 --> 41:30.467

41:24.667 --> 41:30.467
WE TRY IT AGAIN, AND THAT TIME,

41:30.467 --> 41:32.733
I'M ABLE TO GRAB

BUT AT THAT POINT, NO ONE

41:45.467 --> 41:50.367
REALLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.

41:50.367 --> 41:55.667
MY BOYFRIEND SAYS, "YOU KNOW

THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THIS

41:55.667 --> 41:57.967
IS THAT THERE WERE GUARDS

41:57.967 --> 42:00.567
AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CATACOMBS

THAT THE PATIENTS

42:15.333 --> 42:20.500

THAT NIGHT IN THE CATACOMBS

42:23.633 --> 42:27.600

42:27.600 --> 42:29.833
AND BELIEFS ON THE PARANORMAL.

I'VE ALWAYS LISTENED TO

OTHER PEOPLE'S STORIES

42:32.933 --> 42:34.400
AND BEEN VERY SKEPTICAL,

42:34.400 --> 42:40.267
BUT HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE OF

42:34.400 --> 42:40.267
MY OWN REALLY MADE ME BELIEVE.
