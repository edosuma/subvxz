Last on "Perfect Strangers..."

00:03.139 --> 00:06.278
Well, you’re gonna have
this baby any day now.

00:06.312 --> 00:07.816
No, Larry,
I’ve been pregnant so long

00:07.849 --> 00:08.751
that this baby is gonna go

00:08.784 --> 00:12.324
straight from delivery room
to college.

00:12.357 --> 00:15.096
[giggling]

00:15.130 --> 00:18.503
Oh, I feel a funny inside.

00:18.538 --> 00:21.844
I think I’m having
my baby. Oh.

00:21.877 --> 00:24.683
You can’t be having your baby.
I‐I’m due before you are.

00:24.716 --> 00:26.620
It’s my turn.

00:26.654 --> 00:29.224
Guys, the most amazing thing
just happened.

00:29.258 --> 00:31.395
Mary Anne had the baby
in the car.

00:31.428 --> 00:34.134
‐What?
‐Balki, you have a son.

00:39.746 --> 00:41.516
I need to know
everything Mary Anne did

00:41.550 --> 00:44.590
leading up to the birth of
little Robespierre Boinki.

00:44.623 --> 00:48.598
We went for a
helium balloon ride.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.604
And then she wanted a corn dog,
which I really don’t understand.

00:51.637 --> 00:54.810
’Cause it’s not corn
and it’s not a dog, what is it?

00:54.843 --> 00:56.412
It makes perfect sense.

00:56.445 --> 00:58.149
She went up in the balloon,
the air pressure changed

00:58.182 --> 00:59.384
she went into labor.

00:59.418 --> 01:00.688
Now‐now, sweetheart,
listen, listen.

01:00.722 --> 01:02.759
I know you’re not gonna
like this

01:02.792 --> 01:06.432
but I absolutely forbid you
to go up in a balloon.

01:08.804 --> 01:10.608
Now, is‐is that gonna be
a problem, sweetheart?

01:12.646 --> 01:14.214
Larry, are you sure you guys
know what you’re doing?

01:14.248 --> 01:15.416
Absolutely.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.187
Obvious to anyone
with a brain.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.624
‐It is this one.
‐No, I was in the basket.

01:18.658 --> 01:20.962
I know it.

01:20.995 --> 01:22.164
‐Well, now you’ve done it.
‐Well, now you’ve done it.

01:22.197 --> 01:23.499
‐You pulled the wrong rope.
‐You pulled the wrong rope.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.972
‐Now, we can’t get back down!
‐Now, we can’t get back down!

01:26.005 --> 01:27.809
(Larry)
’Balki, get this thing
back down on the ground.’

01:27.842 --> 01:29.613
(Balki)
’I can’t get back.
I don’t know how it works.’

Larry, we’re going up too fast.
I’m feeling strange.

02:55.483 --> 02:56.920
No, it’s okay.
It’s okay, Jennifer.

02:56.954 --> 02:59.158
Everything is gonna be okay.

02:59.191 --> 03:01.028
Well, I hope you’re happy.

03:02.631 --> 03:04.468
We have no way of getting
back down to the ground

03:04.502 --> 03:06.038
thanks to you.

03:06.072 --> 03:08.778
Cousin, this is no time
to place blame.

03:08.811 --> 03:11.182
Sure, we’re no longer
tethered to Mother Earth

03:11.215 --> 03:14.088
but we’re‐we’re communing
with Father Sky

03:14.121 --> 03:17.896
and all his airy
children, the wind

03:17.929 --> 03:20.166
the clouds, that plane!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.137
Duck!

03:22.170 --> 03:24.876
Just kidding. But see
what fun you can have up here?

03:24.910 --> 03:27.648
Yee‐yee‐yay!

03:27.681 --> 03:30.855
Balki, don’t do that
to me again.

03:30.888 --> 03:33.761
Come on, cousin.
Come on. Loosen up. Loosen up.

03:33.794 --> 03:36.699
Have fun with it.
Have fun with it.

03:47.922 --> 03:50.627
May I interrupt this stimulating
discussion to say something?

03:50.661 --> 03:52.999
Yes. Sure.
Tell Balki he’s an idiot.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.136
‐I’m in labor.
‐You see? She agrees with me.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.774
You’re in labor.

03:58.744 --> 04:00.046
‐What?
‐I’m in labor.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.651
Oh, oh, oh, my Lord.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.756
Are‐are you saying
that you’re in labor?

04:04.790 --> 04:08.730
I’m saying I’m having
a contraction, now.

04:08.764 --> 04:10.634
Oh. Ow.
Okay, you’re hurting me.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.939
You’re hurting me.
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.

04:15.310 --> 04:17.314
Well, toss my greens
and call me Caesar.

04:17.346 --> 04:19.652
Jennifer?

04:19.685 --> 04:22.224
Jennifer,
our theory was correct.

04:22.257 --> 04:24.896
Going up in the balloon is what
made Mary Anne go into labor.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.699
I mean, do you realize
what this means?

04:26.733 --> 04:29.672

everywhere will thank us.

04:29.705 --> 04:31.308
We’ve given a great gift
to humanity.

04:31.342 --> 04:33.680
Yeah, yeah humanity,
right, okay.

04:33.713 --> 04:37.789
Listen, Jennifer, do‐do you
think that... Watch it.

04:37.822 --> 04:39.893
Do‐do you think this could be
another false alarm?

04:39.926 --> 04:41.696
No, this is
no false alarm, Larry.

04:41.729 --> 04:45.771
Uh, I think my contractions are
about, uh, eight minutes apart?

04:45.805 --> 04:47.140
Well, alright, then we still
have plenty of time.

04:47.174 --> 04:48.944
We’ll be down
on the ground before you have

04:48.978 --> 04:50.647
your next contraction.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.720
Oh, God.
Another one’s starting.

04:53.753 --> 04:55.925
Alright, okay, alright,
I was wrong about that but

04:55.958 --> 04:58.630
Jen, Jen, shouldn’t you be
doing your Lamaze breathing

04:58.663 --> 05:00.902
in‐instead of trying
to hurt me?

05:00.935 --> 05:03.740
Larry, I never planned on
doing the breathing.

05:03.773 --> 05:05.110
I planned on
having painkillers.

05:05.143 --> 05:06.713
Lots of them.

05:06.746 --> 05:08.282
The only reason I was
in that stupid class was

05:08.316 --> 05:09.785
because it was
the only place I could be

05:09.820 --> 05:11.355
where I wasn’t
the fattest woman in the room.

05:12.992 --> 05:15.096
Larry, I don’t want to have
this baby in a balloon.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.900
Jennifer, Jennifer,
you’re not going to

05:16.934 --> 05:18.136
have this baby
in a balloon.

05:18.169 --> 05:20.173
‐I won’t?
‐Well, of course not.

05:20.206 --> 05:22.277
Don’t be ridiculous.

05:22.310 --> 05:25.250
You’re going to have this baby
in a flimsy wicker basket

05:25.283 --> 05:26.920
suspended from a balloon.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.690
One with lots of patches
in it, I might add.

05:28.723 --> 05:29.759
‐Okay, don’t help, don’t help.
‐Look at that one.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.794
Do not help.
Do not help.

05:30.827 --> 05:31.663
‐I’m just trying to‐‐
‐Thank you. Thank you.

05:31.696 --> 05:33.934
Thank you very much.
Okay, Jen? Jen?

05:33.968 --> 05:35.872
We’re just gonna relax
and‐and why don’t we

05:35.905 --> 05:37.340
uh, try to think of
some funny stories?

05:37.374 --> 05:39.044
Oh. Oh.
I got one. I got one.

05:39.078 --> 05:42.317
Okay, a pig, a butcher and a
rabbi are getting off a bus.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.254
Okay, don’t help. Don’t help.
Don’t help. Do not help.

05:44.288 --> 05:46.425
‐Do not help.
‐I want to tell the story.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.196
Alright, alright, stop it.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.904
You still wanna hear it?
Okay.

05:51.937 --> 05:54.208
Um, oh, did I mention
that the pig could talk?

05:54.241 --> 05:55.878
I can’t do the piggy
little accent

05:55.912 --> 05:58.783
but anyway he’s all
trussed up in this‐‐

05:58.817 --> 06:01.155
If you don’t shut up I’m gonna
throw you to your death.

06:03.827 --> 06:07.034
Balki, my wife
is having a baby!

06:07.067 --> 06:09.906
Well, you’ve known that
for months.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.778
No, I mean she is having
a baby now in‐in this balloon.

06:12.811 --> 06:15.150
And I haven’t
the foggiest idea what to do.

06:15.183 --> 06:18.222
Oh, is that what all
this mishi gastiki is about?

06:18.256 --> 06:19.960
Cousin, chill out.

06:19.993 --> 06:22.064
I know something
about birthin’ babies.

06:22.097 --> 06:25.170
‐You do, Balki?
‐Why, sure.

06:25.203 --> 06:28.409
I’ve delivered my share
of babies and livestock.

06:28.442 --> 06:29.579
If you were gonna
deliver a sheep

06:29.612 --> 06:31.984
I could do that blindfolded.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.319
As a matter of fact,
that’s how we do it back home.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.056
You really don’t wanna look.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.561
Oh, my goodness, there’s
there’s all you have to have

06:37.595 --> 06:39.464
a thing, a bib that comes
from here down to your toes‐‐

06:39.498 --> 06:40.567
Okay, that’s it.
That’s it.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.070
You’re going over the side.

06:42.104 --> 06:44.842
Cousin. Oh. Oh. Oh!

06:44.875 --> 06:46.947
Larry, something’s wrong.
We’re going up again.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.282
Found the problem.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.852
I know why we’re
going up again.

06:49.885 --> 06:52.124
Eh, uh, the‐the sandbag
has a leak.

06:54.294 --> 06:56.432
Larry, we’re going up too high.
We’re gonna run out of oxygen.

06:56.465 --> 06:57.901
‐Oh, no we won’t.
‐We won’t?

06:57.936 --> 06:59.104
No.

06:59.138 --> 07:01.075
Long before
we run out of oxygen

07:01.108 --> 07:04.181
the atmosphere will replace
the helium in the balloon

07:04.214 --> 07:05.617
and the balloon will explode

07:05.651 --> 07:07.921
and the‐the rest
will just upset you.

07:09.692 --> 07:12.330
Alright, alright.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it!

07:12.364 --> 07:15.203
Alright, now two things
have gotta happen here.

07:15.236 --> 07:17.641
Number one,
Balki has got to shut up.

07:19.712 --> 07:22.050
And number two,
someone’s gotta go over the side

07:22.084 --> 07:23.653
and repair the sandbag.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.123
Okay, let’s see Jennifer,
you’re in labor.

07:25.156 --> 07:26.593
I’m your coach.
Balki, that leaves you.

07:26.626 --> 07:27.962
Good luck, buddy.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.972
Cousin, I think I can help
with part one of your plan.

07:33.006 --> 07:34.208
I can shut up.

07:36.078 --> 07:37.347
I think.

07:37.380 --> 07:40.453
But, uh, uh, going over
the side of the basket...

07:40.486 --> 07:43.627
It, let’s see, uh, nope.
Nope. Not gonna happen.

07:45.396 --> 07:48.336
‐Can somebody please go?
‐Oh, sweetheart...

07:48.369 --> 07:51.609
Okay, okay, I’ll‐I’ll go.
But not because you asked me.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.283
For Jennifer.
I’m gonna do it for Jennifer.

07:55.316 --> 07:59.191
And‐and for Howard the balloon
man because‐because, uh

07:59.224 --> 08:01.128
well, without his balloon
Howard the balloon man

08:01.162 --> 08:03.567
is just Howard the man.

08:06.038 --> 08:07.575
[intense music]

08:15.223 --> 08:17.628
Okay, okay, keep breathing.
Keep breathing. Good. Good.

08:17.661 --> 08:19.164
Alright, alright,
and your contraction

08:19.198 --> 08:20.534
should be ending soon. Yes?

08:20.567 --> 08:22.270
Okay, cleansing breath.

08:24.074 --> 08:26.078
Okay, alright.
You’re doing beautifully, Jen.

08:26.112 --> 08:28.182
You’re doing beautifully.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.752
Balki, how you doing?

08:29.785 --> 08:30.754
Uh, good, cousin.

08:30.787 --> 08:33.527
I’ve got a nice strong
grip on the sandbag

08:33.559 --> 08:36.198
and I’ve stopped the flow
of sand with my handkerchief.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.803
But when I pulled my
handkerchief out of my pocket

08:38.837 --> 08:40.841
all the change
in my pocket fell out

08:40.874 --> 08:44.381
but there’s not a whole
lot to spend it on up here.

08:44.414 --> 08:46.385
[laughs]

08:46.418 --> 08:48.557
Where do I come up with them?

08:50.326 --> 08:52.297
I’m fine. I’m fine.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.867
Don’t worry about me.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.103
I’m not.

08:56.739 --> 08:58.543
Okay, Jen,
just‐just try to relax

08:58.577 --> 08:59.645
until your
next contraction.

08:59.679 --> 09:00.881
It’s amazing, Larry.

09:00.914 --> 09:03.553
This‐this breathing stuff
is really helping.

09:03.587 --> 09:06.593
And I’m gonna be with you
every breath of the way.

09:06.626 --> 09:08.763
Cousin? Cousin?

09:08.797 --> 09:11.435
Balki, I can’t talk to you
right now.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.141
Well, uh, it’s now or never.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.212
’We’re about to drop
a hundred and seventy‐one’

09:16.245 --> 09:18.583
’and a half pounds
of counterweight.’

09:18.617 --> 09:20.587
Are we losing
another sandbag?

09:20.621 --> 09:23.860
No, but we’re losing a Balki.

09:23.893 --> 09:25.764
My arches have fallen
and I can’t get up.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.240
Where do I come up
with them?

09:31.308 --> 09:33.246
[intense music]

09:38.623 --> 09:41.829
Oh‐oh‐oh, he’s right.

09:41.863 --> 09:43.800
We’re losing him.

09:43.833 --> 09:48.309
Uh, okay, uh,
Balki, I’m coming.

09:48.342 --> 09:50.581
No! No! No, Larry. Please,
don’t leave me. I’m afraid.

09:50.614 --> 09:52.450

about to plunge

any reason for it.

is the sight of two men
