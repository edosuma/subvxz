12:40.994 --> 12:43.162

All right,
o-okay.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.330
I promise you, you’re not,

12:44.330 --> 12:45.832
y-you’re not gonna
catch a wave like that.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.467
You need to flip over
to the other side.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.968
Okay?

12:48.968 --> 12:50.269
If that’s what
you want to do.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.472

trying to surf like this,

12:52.472 --> 12:53.473
but, uh,
today’s not...
(coughs)

12:55.475 --> 12:57.644
Hey, if it’s surf
lesson you guys want,

12:57.644 --> 12:59.679
then go down to the office
and book with them, okay?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.481
It’s about your sister.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.151
Just give me a
minute, okay?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.556
I already told you
everything I know, okay?

13:10.556 --> 13:12.425
Lyla disappeared
a long time ago.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.294
All right? I-I don’t
have anything else to say.
Maybe you help us

13:15.294 --> 13:17.597
a little bit. I mean,
I’m getting sand in my shoes.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.068
You ever seen that
photograph of your sister?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.803
No. No. Where’d you
get this from?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.138
It’s, uh, from

13:25.138 --> 13:26.906
an anonymous donor.
We don’t know who took it,

13:26.906 --> 13:28.274
we don’t know
where it’s from.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.543
But, uh, we do know that it’s
probably the last photograph

13:30.543 --> 13:31.711
taken of her.
And we’re just curious--

13:31.711 --> 13:32.979
maybe you could help us out--

13:32.979 --> 13:34.080
where she got
a necklace like that.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.415
We’re thinking
somebody

13:35.415 --> 13:38.317
must’ve bought that for her.
Maybe an admirer.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.852
Wonder if you had
anybody in mind.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.023
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.812
Okay, just, uh, for my own
sanity, wh-what makes you

14:05.812 --> 14:07.880
think that this time
is gonna be any different?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.215
It has to be.
It does?

14:09.215 --> 14:10.483
Yeah, it does,
all right?
Uh-huh.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.118
We want to find this kid,
Lyla Kekoa--

14:12.118 --> 14:13.386
got to talk to Pettifer.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.188
The last two times that
we made a visit to this guy

14:15.188 --> 14:16.856
his people made it very clear
that he didn’t want to

14:16.856 --> 14:18.091
talk to anybody,
he don’t want any visitors.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.425
Yeah, well, maybe we were

14:19.425 --> 14:21.327
a little too polite
last time, Milton.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.863
Well, we need a warrant, you
understand? Without a warrant,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.898
he’s not gonna let us in.
He’s not gonna invite us in.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.200
This guy--
look at him, look at him.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.102
This beauty. He looks
like a walking pool table.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.770
Just calm down,
calm down.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.872
Just relax. How you doing?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.940
Hey, how you doing there?
You two again.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.341
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unless you have

14:35.341 --> 14:38.010
a search warrant, this is
gonna be a short conversation.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.613
Oh, sure, sure,
we got a warrant.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.482
Yeah, now what... Milton,
where’d you put that...
I had a warrant somewhere.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.549
I had it somewhere, I-I
Milton, where’d you,
uh... where’d you

14:43.549 --> 14:45.251
put that search warrant?
stuck it in my shoe.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.819

14:47.954 --> 14:50.423

14:55.695 --> 14:57.897
Afternoon, Mr. Pettifer.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.599
Who the hell are you?

14:59.599 --> 15:00.800
Oh, I’m, uh,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.368
I’m Detective
Steve McGarrett.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.937
And this here handsome thing
is my partner,

15:04.937 --> 15:06.773
Detective Milton Cooper.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.108
Is that, uh, that the LA Times?

15:09.108 --> 15:10.209
Can I see that?

15:10.209 --> 15:11.778
That’s amazing.
You had this flown in

15:11.778 --> 15:14.046
from the... from the states?
That’s very rich, very nice.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.048
You can’t just
barge into my house

15:16.048 --> 15:17.850
and harass me
in my own home.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.318
Governor Poindexter
will hear about this.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.220
I’ll have both your badges.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.822
Mr. Pettifer,
we just want five minutes

15:22.822 --> 15:24.624
of your time,
Just a couple questions.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.859
I want you off my property now.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.261
Uh-huh. I understand
that, sir.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.629
Why don’t you
take a look at this?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.066
That kid’s name
was Lyla Kekoa,

15:34.066 --> 15:36.035
but I don’t have to
tell you that, do I?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.573
Such a rare beauty.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.241
So much life ahead of her.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.344
(sighs)
But it’s been nine years now,

15:45.344 --> 15:47.713
I don’t know how
you think I can help.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.849
Well, you can start by,
uh, maybe telling us

15:49.849 --> 15:51.117
if you know anything
about that ice

15:51.117 --> 15:52.885
she was wearing around
her neck in that picture.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.320
I don’t know anything
about that.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.389
Really?
Well, ’cause we, uh,

15:56.389 --> 15:59.125
think that somebody
bought it for her,

15:59.125 --> 16:00.593
somebody who can afford
a thing like that.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.628
Someone with a nice plantation,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.430
somebody who, uh, has papers
flown in from the States...

16:04.430 --> 16:05.898
Now, wait a second.
No, you

16:05.898 --> 16:07.500
wait a second, sir.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.835
You had her father
and her brother

16:08.835 --> 16:11.103
working in the cane fields,
but you had that kid

16:11.103 --> 16:12.972
up here in the house,
didn’t you, huh?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.907
She meant something
to you, Mr. Pettifer.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.244
Lyla.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.282
(sighs) Lyla was too
delicate to work the cane.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.550
Uh-huh.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.353
Uh, so you had her up here.
Was that out of the kindness

16:27.353 --> 16:29.922
of your heart or did she
have to do something for you?

16:29.922 --> 16:31.157
I loved Lyla.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.658
Like a daughter.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.261
If you cared about her,
now’s the time to show it.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.896
(sighs)

16:38.865 --> 16:41.868
Lyla came to me a week
before she went missing.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.202
What, uh, what for?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.570
To offer me money.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.138
$300 dollars,
as I recall.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.207
Wait a minute,
Lyla gave you money?

16:48.207 --> 16:50.243
It was the first installment
to pay off a debt

16:50.243 --> 16:51.644
her father had owed me.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.280
She was determined to get
her family off my plantation.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.581
Wait a minute,
you didn’t think to ask

16:55.581 --> 16:57.016
where this kid
was getting the money?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.051
Maybe where
the necklace came from.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.054
Believe what you want,
detectives.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.257
The truth is I only wanted
the best for that girl.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.192
(phone ringing)
And when she offered me
the money...

17:08.628 --> 17:09.662

17:11.130 --> 17:12.298

the plantation-- come on.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.796
If she was desperate to
pay off Mr. Pettifer,

17:43.796 --> 17:45.231

what kind of trouble

17:45.231 --> 17:46.632

I was with her the night
that photo was taken.

26:12.538 --> 26:13.705
DANNY:
Hmm.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.641
We were at the
same joint,

26:15.641 --> 26:17.643
the Gator Lounge.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.646
Lyla was over the moon.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.047
Over the moon?

26:22.047 --> 26:24.483
She was in love.

26:24.483 --> 26:27.653
It was around 1:00. She got
into a man’s fancy new car,

26:27.653 --> 26:29.188
and, uh,

26:29.188 --> 26:31.223
and that was it.

26:31.223 --> 26:34.226
Is that, uh, the guy
who gave her the necklace?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.361
Mm-hmm.
Same guy, huh?

26:36.361 --> 26:37.930
What was his name?

That’s okay. I think I can

this girl gave you?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.190

No?

27:40.058 --> 27:41.093
No?

both off the street

JERRY:
So I went through
the HPD archives,

28:14.459 --> 28:16.261
pulled everything
from around the time

28:16.261 --> 28:17.763
that Lyla Kekoa went missing.

28:17.763 --> 28:21.433
April 10, 1932,
James Whitmour receives

28:21.433 --> 28:23.936
a brand-new Phantom II

28:23.936 --> 28:25.203
for his 25th birthday.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.972
That is definitely
a "fancy car."

28:26.972 --> 28:28.407
That’s our James.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.910
Whitmour? Whit...
Is this kid the son of, uh,

28:31.910 --> 28:35.080
uh, Clarence Whitmour,
the casino man?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.349
Mobster, you mean?
Yeah, the very same.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.152
In fact, his pops is the one
that bought him that car.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.853
Well, who’s the broad?

28:41.853 --> 28:45.891
That would be James’s fiancée,
Ellen DeBecker,

28:45.891 --> 28:49.261
of the DeBecker diamond fortune.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.764
Okay. Well, if I was
engaged to her,

28:52.764 --> 28:55.033
I’d be keeping my hula
girlfriend a secret, too.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.735
Good work, Flanagan.
It looks like we need to talk

28:56.735 --> 28:58.036
to James Whitmour.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.638
Yeah, one problem with that.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.273
He’s dead.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.709
He’s dead.
This ran in the late edition

29:03.709 --> 29:08.180
of the Honolulu Star,
April 18, 1932.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.016
STEVE: April 18.
STEVE:
That’s-that’s the same day

29:11.016 --> 29:12.517
that Lyla went missing.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.119
JERRY:
The crime scene report states

29:14.119 --> 29:17.923
that James Whitmour was found
by a beat cop at 3:30 a.m.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.392
in an alley in Hell’s Half-Acre.

29:20.392 --> 29:24.496
C.O.D., multiple gunshot wounds,
mostly likely tommy gun.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.531
A tommy gun, you say?

29:26.531 --> 29:30.135
Where’s the blood, Flanagan?

29:30.135 --> 29:32.070
If he was hit by a
tommy gun, there’d be

29:32.070 --> 29:34.239
a big pool of blood
under the body.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.008
Show me the autopsy report.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.783
Okay. Right here,
look at this:

29:44.783 --> 29:47.085
"Liver mortis observed

29:47.085 --> 29:50.756
in the posterior and lumbar."

29:50.756 --> 29:53.158
Which means that he would’ve
had to have been sitting down

29:53.158 --> 29:54.660
when he was shot.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.529
Yes, indeed, but the previous
photo you showed us, Flanagan,

29:57.529 --> 30:00.165
he was clearly lying facedown
in the street.

30:00.165 --> 30:01.667
So someone moved the body.

30:01.667 --> 30:05.904
Maybe he was sitting in that
fancy car when he got shot.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.241
If Lyla Kekoa left the club
with James that night,

30:09.241 --> 30:11.276
it’s possible that
she was inside of that car

30:11.276 --> 30:13.645
when the hit went down.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.580
It’s possible.
(phone ringing)

30:18.650 --> 30:21.086
Yes, hello. This is McGarrett.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.857
Doctor, are you
100% sure?

30:25.857 --> 30:29.928
No, no, I appreciate
the call. Thank you.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.631
That was Dr. Shinseki,
from the coroner’s office.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.800
He just told me off the record
that he has managed to I.D.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.835
one of the perps from
the Fleetmaster crash

30:36.835 --> 30:38.336
by his fingerprints.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.339
The man was a known associate
of Clarence Whitmour.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.809
And if I don’t
miss my guess,

30:43.809 --> 30:48.547
Clarence Whitmour knows exactly
who killed his son.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.115
It was Earl Blackstone.

30:50.115 --> 30:51.416
It is common knowledge

30:51.416 --> 30:52.984
that there has been a feud

30:52.984 --> 30:56.254
between these two families
since 1932.

30:56.254 --> 30:59.124
What odds do you want,
on this being the spark

30:59.124 --> 31:00.892
that ignited the whole thing?

31:00.892 --> 31:02.828
All right, let’s say
Lyla was in that car.

31:02.828 --> 31:04.963
All right, makes sense to me
that Whitmour would want

31:04.963 --> 31:06.732
to make the whole thing
disappear because he would not

31:06.732 --> 31:09.701
want people knowing that his son
was messing with a hula girl.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.170
So the crime wasn’t the murder,
it was the cover-up.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.440
Exactly. We need to go and
talk to Clarence Whitmour.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.275
Because you know
what this means?

31:17.275 --> 31:18.877
He knows what happened

34:26.932 --> 34:28.333
I don’t, I don’t have a badge.

Oh, good. Okay.
Thank you very much.

34:39.878 --> 34:44.950
Your son, James, was in
a relationship with Lyla Kekoa.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.985
They were together the night
he was gunned down.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.455
In fact, he was driving a very
nice, new Rolls Phantom II

34:50.455 --> 34:51.656
that you bought him.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.758
My guess is that
both of those kids

34:53.758 --> 34:56.261

What the hell is going on?

36:02.494 --> 36:06.431
They’re attacking Pearl Harbor.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.036
(truck beeping)

36:12.604 --> 36:14.539
(garbage cans crashing)

36:34.192 --> 36:35.460
Hey, look at this.
I’m, uh,

36:35.460 --> 36:38.063
doing my own research
on Chang Apana.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.298
It’s actually, uh,

36:40.298 --> 36:41.866
it’s a good--
W-What’s the matter with you?

36:41.866 --> 36:43.501
I think I just solved this case.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.903
I think I know what happened
to Lyla Kekoa.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.543
STEVE:
All right, now, bear with me.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.945
Finding the car is the key

36:53.945 --> 36:57.048
to finding out
what happened to Lyla.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.149
Let me just stop you
for one second.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.484
Just, I just want to be clear.

36:59.484 --> 37:00.919
Um, Chang Apana,

37:00.919 --> 37:03.088
this brilliant detective...

37:03.088 --> 37:04.656
he was HPD’s finest.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.124
You know, greatest
of all time.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.492
He couldn’t solve
this case, but you, uh...

37:07.492 --> 37:09.928
you did it in your sleep?

37:09.928 --> 37:11.329
I know this sounds crazy,
but I’m telling you

37:11.329 --> 37:13.031
this was all in the file.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.200
It’s nuts.
I mean, it was like

37:15.200 --> 37:17.268
a bunch of pieces
to a puzzle.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.336
I just had to put ’em together.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.139
What?
Why with the face?

37:21.139 --> 37:24.342
Nothing. I-I just realized
I’m not gonna get any peace

37:24.342 --> 37:27.679
until you continue, and
I let you finish this thing.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.481
So, please, go ahead.
Thank you, Daniel.

37:29.481 --> 37:33.651
Okay, on the night that
Lyla Kekoa went missing

37:33.651 --> 37:35.920
and James Whitmour
got murdered,

37:35.920 --> 37:37.622
they were last seen,
the two of them,

37:37.622 --> 37:40.358
getting into James’s
Rolls-Royce Phantom.
Okay.

37:40.358 --> 37:44.696
Now, James’s body was found
sometime the next morning.

37:44.696 --> 37:48.399
But Lyla Kekoa, never seen
or heard of ever again.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.301
Nor was the
Rolls-Royce Phantom--

37:50.301 --> 37:51.536
a very distinctive car

37:51.536 --> 37:53.571
that would have attracted
a lot of attention.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.340
I don’t care how
distinctive the car was,

37:55.340 --> 37:57.375
finding a 90-year-old automobile
is basically impossible.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.310
It could be in a million
different pieces.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.279
It could be in a million
different places...
Exactly.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.182
Okay, James Whitmour died
behind the wheel of that car.

38:04.182 --> 38:06.484
Multiple gunshot wounds.
They hit him with a machine gun.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.719
Which means those bullets had to

38:07.719 --> 38:08.820
cut through the frame
of the car,

38:08.820 --> 38:10.255
through the windshield
to get to him.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.790
Oh, so a 90-year-old car
with bullet holes.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.057
You should have
just said that.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.792
That doesn’t make it
that much easier.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.427
Whitmour senior orders
the cleanup.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.263
Okay, he has to get Lyla
and the Rolls off the road

38:18.263 --> 38:21.332
before this tragedy
turns into a scandal.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.835
Now, like the driver, the car is
riddled with bullets, riddled.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.970
It can’t be drivable.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.539
So, how do you get rid
of a wrecked car?

38:27.539 --> 38:28.940
You tow it.
You tow it.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.808
That’s what you do,
you tow it.

38:32.877 --> 38:36.447
One of Whitmour senior’s listed
companies is a haulage firm.

38:36.447 --> 38:37.849
Now, I’m going through
their old log books,

38:37.849 --> 38:39.317
and I find a record

38:39.317 --> 38:41.286
of a journey made
from downtown Honolulu

38:41.286 --> 38:43.721
to the Whitmour estate
that very same night.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.558
So you think that the car was
put on the estate somewhere?

38:46.558 --> 38:49.227
A dead body, blood,
shot-up car--

38:49.227 --> 38:52.063
it’s got to be put somewhere
no one can find it. Right?

38:52.063 --> 38:55.300
January 23, 1932.

38:55.300 --> 38:59.137
Whitmour senior submits plans
to the local zoning commission

38:59.137 --> 39:01.072
for a swimming pool
to be built on the estate.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.541
Now, according to
financial records,

39:03.541 --> 39:07.178
he hired a company to, uh,
to start work on said project.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.314
Check this out.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.219
No pool.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.920
No pool.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.855
(men shouting)

39:26.231 --> 39:28.433
DANNY:
Unbelievable.
STEVE: What?

39:28.433 --> 39:31.035
You did it, you solved
a 90-year-old cold case.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.072
STEVE:
I didn’t solve it.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.008
I just got it

I don’t know, look,

41:02.927 --> 41:05.997
This case has got me

That’s not what I mean.
What are you talking about?

41:24.682 --> 41:27.185
I’m talking about
my grandfather.
Uh-huh.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.221
Okay, what about him?

41:30.221 --> 41:32.790
He would have given anything
to be a cop, that guy.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.158
You know what he gave?
He gave his life

41:34.158 --> 41:35.526
fighting for this country.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.895
And then here I am,
I got the badge.

41:37.895 --> 41:39.964
I got this great job.

41:39.964 --> 41:42.367
What am I doing
running a restaurant, Danny?

41:42.367 --> 41:44.302
What am I doing?

41:46.804 --> 41:48.306
Uh, is that a joke, or...

41:48.306 --> 41:49.741
No, it’s not a joke.
And I’m really sorry.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.142
I know you’re gonna be mad.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.978
Danny, being a cop is
all I know now.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.646
And I love my job.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.915
Why am I gonna
walk away from it?

41:59.584 --> 42:01.018
Dude, I’m sorry.
I really am sorry.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.954
I didn’t...

42:05.289 --> 42:06.524
You’re mad, right?

42:06.524 --> 42:09.394
If you’re out, I’m out.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.162
What did you say?

42:11.162 --> 42:12.630
If you’re out, I’m out.

42:12.630 --> 42:13.831
I thought you were sick
of dodging bullets.

42:13.831 --> 42:15.299
You told me you didn’t
want to get shot at.

42:15.299 --> 42:16.401
I’d-I’d rather die
from a bullet

42:16.401 --> 42:19.203
than die from the stress
of running this place.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.072
Really? Seriously?
Yeah.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.707
What about the...
I mean, we got...

42:22.707 --> 42:24.208
Kamekona calls me,
like, twice a day.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.811
He wants to buy us out
of our share, so...

42:26.811 --> 42:30.648
Don’t move, don’t move.

42:30.648 --> 42:33.484
Okay.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.119
To-to us...
Okay. Yes.

42:35.119 --> 42:37.655
...and our very short

42:37.655 --> 42:39.824

Yes. Passionate.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.226
Passionate, successful run...
Yes.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.394
...as restaurateurs.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.530
And, if I may...

42:45.530 --> 42:47.331
