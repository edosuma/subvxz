00:02.503 --> 00:09.671
The young Namekian warriors
fought it out against Freeza's men.

00:09.760 --> 00:15.130
The quick-thinking village elder
destroyed the band's Scouters.

00:15.224 --> 00:19.718
But that in turn invited a new crisis.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.725
I'll kill them all!!

"Dodoria's Hectic Chase of Terror!
A Truth Revealed to Vegeta. "

02:06.627 --> 02:10.791
--E|der!
--Dodoria-san! Just a moment!

02:10.881 --> 02:13.918
Begin by first killing the three younger ones!

02:15.886 --> 02:18.127
Damn it!

02:25.354 --> 02:28.846
I'll put all three of you away in ten seconds!

02:28.941 --> 02:32.934
Ridiculous! Do you think you're
a match for all three of us?!

02:33.028 --> 02:35.644
Am I a match for all three of you, you ask?

02:35.739 --> 02:38.025
Such an amusing joke.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.697
What?!

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.983 --> 03:12.473
--What?!
--|t's no use!

03:12.568 --> 03:15.150
It will take more than that attack to defeat him!

03:33.088 --> 03:35.545
You must now realize that defying me

03:35.632 --> 03:39.250
or trying to run away will do you no good.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.302
But, in any event, come on down here.

03:45.267 --> 03:50.057
You have finally become compliant. That will do.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.731
You destroyed our precious Scouters.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.810
What do you say you produce your
Dragon Ball for me, to apologize?

04:02.784 --> 04:05.196
I've got no other choice.
But promise me one thing:

04:05.287 --> 04:08.620
that you will not harm
the children, no matter what!

04:12.210 --> 04:16.077
It could have been this way from the beginning.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.754
Why, those |ousy...!

04:17.841 --> 04:22.175
H-Hey, Gohan, don't go getting any funny ideas.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.971
We are just no match for those guys.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.976
Now, take this, and leave here at once!

04:35.067 --> 04:37.183
Good work.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.020
While we are at it, how about you tell me

04:41.114 --> 04:44.322
where the other two Dragon Balls are?

04:44.409 --> 04:48.903
Don't be absurd! We Namekians
would die before doing anything

04:48.997 --> 04:51.238
like selling each other out!

04:56.672 --> 04:59.505
My, my, not you, too?

04:59.591 --> 05:04.506
No one on this planet ever says
anything about their companions.

05:04.596 --> 05:08.930
Sure enough, I must have you die,
along with the children.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.803
What did you say?!

05:15.774 --> 05:17.264
That wasn't our agreement!

05:17.359 --> 05:20.192
You said if I gave you the Dragon Ball,
you wouldn't do anything to us!

05:20.278 --> 05:23.065
But unless you have all
seven Dragon Balls together,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.647
there is no meaning, is there?

05:25.742 --> 05:29.576
You have destroyed our Scouters,

05:29.663 --> 05:33.201
so I must ask you to tell us where
the remaining two balls are.

05:33.291 --> 05:38.456
I told you, I'll die before telling
you where my people are!

05:38.547 --> 05:41.084
Is that how badly you wish to die?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.460
In that case, I will do as you ask.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.837
What?!

05:44.928 --> 05:47.761
Kill all three of them.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.635
--Yes, sir.
--T-That was dirty!

05:50.726 --> 05:53.308
You two run away! Run away from here!

05:53.395 --> 05:55.101
R-Right!

05:56.648 --> 06:00.061
Let me show you some Namekian pride!

06:09.036 --> 06:10.572
Ca rgot!

06:12.706 --> 06:15.288
Control yourself, Gohan!

06:16.960 --> 06:21.169
Control yourself! There's nothing we can do!

06:21.256 --> 06:25.090
Cargot... Cargot! Cargot!

06:56.041 --> 06:59.408
You never had time to show
us your so-called "pride"!

07:13.350 --> 07:16.808
It's a trivial matter to crush a kid like this.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.814
Well, be that as it may, die!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.942
Stop!!

07:27.489 --> 07:31.528
What?! A buddy of yours?! Where?!

07:39.334 --> 07:41.495
That'll show you!

07:45.048 --> 07:47.790
W-Who are you?!

07:47.884 --> 07:50.045
That idiot!

07:50.137 --> 07:53.129
I am going to belt you!

07:53.223 --> 07:55.305
You're gonna what?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.346
Kuririn-san?

07:59.437 --> 08:03.771
Y-You dumbass! G-Get out of here, quick!

08:03.859 --> 08:05.144
Quick!

08:05.235 --> 08:06.771
Right!

08:08.029 --> 08:10.896
D-Damn it...

08:10.991 --> 08:14.825
(30 after them! Dodoria-san, catch them!

08:14.911 --> 08:18.074
Gohan! Fly as fast as you can!
If they catch us, it's all over!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.701
Right!

08:23.170 --> 08:26.913
You fools! Do you think you can get away?!

08:31.761 --> 08:34.298
It's no use! He's faster than us!

08:34.389 --> 08:35.970
He's catching up!

08:40.061 --> 08:41.676
Gohan!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.445
Oh, no!

08:55.535 --> 08:57.321
Damn it!

08:58.914 --> 09:00.825
I won't make it in time!

09:04.169 --> 09:07.957
Gohan, run! Hurry! He's coming!

09:13.094 --> 09:16.882
Damn, these guys sure are slippery!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.682
Kuririn-san, let's descend and fight him!

09:21.770 --> 09:24.978
We can't! He's not an opponent we
can get anywhere with by fighting!

09:25.065 --> 09:27.431
Just keep flying as fast as you can!

09:29.361 --> 09:31.477
Ah, I know!

09:31.571 --> 09:34.779
Gohan, from here on, don't look
in my direction! Close your eyes!

09:34.866 --> 09:37.152
I have an idea. Got it?!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.780
Yes!

09:40.080 --> 09:42.241
Take this!

09:42.332 --> 09:44.948
Taiyo-ken!!

09:48.004 --> 09:52.668
My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

09:52.759 --> 09:55.592
I did it! l-lt worked!

09:55.679 --> 09:58.421
Gohan, hide now, while we can!

09:58.515 --> 10:00.005
Right!

10:17.575 --> 10:20.988
Damn it, where did you go?!

10:21.079 --> 10:22.910
Damn it all!

10:30.505 --> 10:33.338
It's all right. He'll never find us.

10:33.425 --> 10:38.294
The old man destroying those
Scouter things really saved our butts!

10:38.388 --> 10:39.218
If he had one of them,

10:39.306 --> 10:42.548
he could even detect the Ki
coming from that little kid, after all.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.767
Damn, how am I supposed
to find those puny guys?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.940
This is driving me crazy!

10:54.279 --> 10:57.442
Thank goodness. He's giving up, and leaving.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.113
I'll just blow them away.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.875
See you in hell!

11:29.230 --> 11:33.940
Take that. That's what you
get for sneaking around.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.568
Freeza-sama told me to bring them back,

11:40.658 --> 11:42.364
but this is better than letting them get away.

11:42.452 --> 11:47.196
But then, I never did find out
who those punks really were.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.406
They weren't your run-of-the-mill kids.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.709
But it doesn't matter either way, now.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.668
We're saved!

11:59.844 --> 12:03.382
For now, let's head back to
where Bulma-san is, okay?

12:03.473 --> 12:06.431
Are you able to fly?

12:06.518 --> 12:08.600
Y-Yes.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.103
T-Thank you so much for saving me.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.731
If you want to thank someone,
thank Gohan, here.

12:18.822 --> 12:22.030
l was so scared, I didn't want to help.

12:22.117 --> 12:27.328
But Kuririn-san, if you hadn't
saved us, we'd both be dead.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.741
Well, in any case, come with us.

12:32.836 --> 12:36.044
We're not exactly the bad guys here, after all.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.260
Okay.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.386
There are, in fact, Dragon Balls here,

12:48.476 --> 12:49.465
but these weirdoes keep ganging together,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.643
and if they all get taken away like this,

12:52.730 --> 12:55.392
there's no reason why a fragile lady like me

12:55.483 --> 12:59.021
should have to risk all the danger
to come to this planet, is there?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.068
Am I right?

13:01.156 --> 13:03.613
Hey, Dad, are you listening?!

13:03.700 --> 13:07.784
Oh, yes, I'm listening to every word.
So, what's the matter?

13:07.871 --> 13:10.988
Anyhow, everything is as bad as it can be.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.748
The spaceship is all busted up,
and we can't come home.

13:14.085 --> 13:17.077
Come home?

13:17.172 --> 13:19.584
That's not a good idea, is it?

13:19.674 --> 13:23.383
Goku just barely took off for there.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.055
Huh? Son-kun? Son-kun is
coming here to Planet Namek?

13:28.141 --> 13:31.133
Really? He really, really is?

13:31.227 --> 13:35.937
Yeah, that's right. He's scheduled
to arrive in about six days.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.683
Hooray!

13:39.777 --> 13:41.688
Hey, Bulma!

13:43.781 --> 13:45.362
You know, without Scouters,

13:45.450 --> 13:49.739
it's gonna be a big pain finding
those last two Dragon Balls.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.196
Sure, it's not that big a planet, but still...

14:14.687 --> 14:16.894
V-Vegeta! Why, you...!

14:16.981 --> 14:21.020
Yo! It's been quite a long while,
hasn't it, Dodoria-san?

14:21.110 --> 14:25.774
A-Are you the one that blindsided me, Vegeta?

14:25.865 --> 14:30.359
You and Zarbon are always hanging
around with Freeza, after all.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.944
l was waiting for you to go out on your own.

14:33.039 --> 14:37.078
After all, as long as Freeza isn't
around, I'll bet I can handle you.

14:37.168 --> 14:42.629
What?! A Saiyan like you?! You've got
quite a smart mouth, don't you?!

14:47.428 --> 14:52.798
Vegeta, you hand over that Scouter,
nice and easy, and then beat it.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.476
Do that, and I'll let you go this one time.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.724
So that's it. The sound cut out all of a sudden,

14:58.815 --> 15:00.897
so I thought something must have happened,

15:00.984 --> 15:04.522
and sure enough, it sounds
like you've lost your Scouters.

15:06.698 --> 15:11.158
This is great. Now, if I approach,
you won't know it.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.859
What did you say?!

15:14.872 --> 15:17.579
It will take several days for you
to go back to Planet Freeza

15:17.667 --> 15:20.283
to fetch some more Scouters.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.494
I'll bet you want this.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.920
You've decided to hand it over, huh?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.753
It's about time you felt intimidated.

15:30.847 --> 15:36.387
Now, if you're lucky, I might just spare your life.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.698
H-How could you do that, Vegeta?!

15:51.784 --> 15:54.366
W-Why did you destroy it?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.822
Because I don't need it anymore.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.079
W-What? Without that thing,

16:02.170 --> 16:05.128
you don't know where Freeza-sama
or the Namekians are, either.

16:05.214 --> 16:09.958
Unfortunately for you...
while fighting the earthlings,

16:10.053 --> 16:12.886
I learned that they could tell an
opponent's strength and location

16:12.972 --> 16:15.839
without having to use a Scouter.

16:17.143 --> 16:22.103
And there was another Saiyan there
who possessed the technique.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.558
In which case, I should be
able to do it, too, right?

16:29.530 --> 16:32.272
It's easy, once you learn how to do it.

16:32.367 --> 16:36.030
Although, it would be too much
for you or Freeza to handle,

16:36.120 --> 16:39.408
since you only have your eyes set on power.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.208
But then, I was like that, too, up to now.

16:43.294 --> 16:47.162
I get it! Those runts I was chasing
were earthlings, weren't they?

16:47.256 --> 16:48.507
Earthlings?!

16:48.591 --> 16:52.334
You've joined up with the
earthlings, haven't you?!

16:52.428 --> 16:57.968
Dream on! There's no way the
earthlings could have come here.

16:58.059 --> 17:02.348
If they were here, I'd take
care of them first thing!

17:02.438 --> 17:07.102
None of that matters! Just get out of here!

17:07.193 --> 17:10.481
Unless you'd rather I kill you!

17:10.570 --> 17:14.814
I-I'm offering to let you go!
You should be grateful!

17:14.909 --> 17:19.824
What are you so scared of?
Why don't you come at me, already?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.200
I know why.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.247
You learned from my fight with Kewie

17:24.335 --> 17:28.624
that my strength is much
greater than it was before,

17:28.715 --> 17:30.706
and now you're afraid!

17:32.260 --> 17:34.626
You saw it on your Scouter, right?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.336
My battle power?

17:36.431 --> 17:41.346
T-That rating was wrong!
It was a Scouter malfunction!

17:41.436 --> 17:45.349
Don't you shrug me off!

17:54.532 --> 17:56.693
You're the one who's shrugged me off!

17:56.784 --> 17:59.617
There's no way that move
was going to work on me!

18:05.626 --> 18:09.585
We Saiyans grow stronger with every fight.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.837
The stronger our opponents are,
the more our strength increases.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.308
That's why, after nearly getting
killed in battle on Earth,

18:21.392 --> 18:23.974
I've powered way up!

18:24.061 --> 18:26.894
That's what the warrior Saiyan race does!

18:26.981 --> 18:31.350
Is this what's become of your vaunted
power with you slacking off? Eh?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.818
W-Wait, Vegeta! If you'll let me go,

18:37.909 --> 18:40.070
I'll let you in on a little secret!

18:40.161 --> 18:43.278
It's about your homeworld, Planet Vegeta!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.623
What?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.493
Did you say Planet Vegeta?

18:46.584 --> 18:49.326
What secret about Planet Vegeta?!

18:49.420 --> 18:52.537
Let me go! Let me go, and I'll tell you!

19:01.557 --> 19:06.597
Y-You're not gonna kill me as
soon as I've told you, are you?

19:06.687 --> 19:10.100
I'll kill you right now unless
you tell me! Start talking!

19:10.191 --> 19:13.058
Your homeworld of Planet Vegeta

19:13.152 --> 19:16.770
wasn't lost in a collision with a giant meteor,

19:16.864 --> 19:19.856
like Freeza-sama told you.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.111
What did you say?

19:21.202 --> 19:26.947
Individually, a Saiyan's strength
is nowhere near Freeza-sama's...

19:27.041 --> 19:29.783
But if a bunch of Saiyans united together,

19:29.877 --> 19:32.539
it would prove to be quite a problem.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.790
What's more,

19:33.881 --> 19:36.372
there were a small number of
Saiyans being born who, like you,

19:36.467 --> 19:38.207
were becoming extraordinary warriors,

19:38.302 --> 19:41.214
and the number was starting to grow.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.967
Once you started inexplicably
possessing such power,

19:44.058 --> 19:47.050
you wouldn't remain an obedient,
order-following race forever,

19:47.144 --> 19:48.805
so at that point,

19:48.896 --> 19:52.855
Freeza-sama decided that
he needed to take measures.

19:52.942 --> 19:57.527
And so, Freeza-sama destroyed Planet Vegeta,

19:57.613 --> 20:00.901
and all of the Saiyans on it, himself!

20:00.992 --> 20:04.405
But Vegeta, you should be
grateful to Freeza-sama.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.737
It appeared that he could make
use the prodigious skills of you,

20:07.832 --> 20:09.368
the prince of Planet Vegeta,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.790
and so Freeza-sama intentionally waited

20:11.878 --> 20:14.369
until you were no longer on the planet.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.630
Looks like your shock is as great as you'd expect.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.927
I'll just use this opportunity
to return to Freeza-sama.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.598
Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

20:26.684 --> 20:31.804
I don't give a damn about the planet,
my friends, or my parents.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.560
I'm just disgusted at myself for not knowing this,

20:34.650 --> 20:39.895
and letting myself be used as your
doormat ever since I was a kid!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.980
Freeza-sama!

20:57.298 --> 21:02.167
Freeza is afraid of the fathomless
potential of the Saiyans.

21:04.221 --> 21:09.136
I have to hurry up and
conquer this 20-times gravity.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.309
Now, to get started!

21:16.400 --> 21:18.982
Goku is full of get-up-and-go.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.528
Vegeta continues to increase his strength.

21:22.615 --> 21:27.484
The time for the two of them
to clash once again is near.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
doko demo iku yo sokkou

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
kakegaenai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
Yabame no kono jidai

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Yaru n da furupawaa

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
mirai shinjite

22:36.022 --> 22:37.762
I've got five and a half days before I arrive,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.188
and I'm gonna get stronger!

22:39.275 --> 22:41.607
Vegeta is on this planet, too. This is the pits!

22:41.694 --> 22:43.434
He's after the Dragon Balls.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.771
Those Freeza guys have five, leaving only two.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.199
That's Vegeta's Ki!
He's attacking a different village!

22:50.286 --> 22:52.151
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.246 --> 22:55.613
"Vegeta's Covert Maneuvers!
A Tragic Assault on the Namekians. ”

22:55.708 --> 22:59.200
Father, I've made a friend here, too.
