01:26.218 --> 01:27.310
Shh.

03:32.385 --> 03:34.825
<i>It's a beautiful
summer day in Chicago today.</i>

03:34.888 --> 03:37.391
<i>Temperatures expected
to reach the upper 80s.</i>

03:37.599 --> 03:41.479
<i>In recent news, a health advisory was
reported from Happy Poultry Farms.</i>

03:41.686 --> 03:44.155
<i>They're telling us
they're issuing a full recall</i>

03:44.356 --> 03:48.361
<i>for their pre-cooked chicken tenders
and also their buffalo chicken tenders.</i>

03:48.568 --> 03:51.287
<i>This only applies to chicken
that was packaged Friday</i>

03:51.488 --> 03:54.287
<i>and delivered to Fort Chicken
and Danville.</i>

03:54.491 --> 03:57.495
Morning, honey.
- Ahem.

03:57.702 --> 03:59.796
Rise and shine.

03:59.996 --> 04:01.998
- Morning, Mum.
- How's the book going?

04:02.207 --> 04:04.676
Good. Yeah, I've been working
really hard on it.

04:04.876 --> 04:08.881
Rewriting it. It's a first draught,
you know. Did you get a chance

04:09.089 --> 04:11.763
- to read the manuscript?
- I did and I loved it.

04:11.966 --> 04:16.596
- Oh. Any thoughts? Criticisms?
- No, I thought it was wonderful.

04:17.596 --> 04:21.567
I won't become a better writer if I don't
get constructive criticism. Please.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.021
- I'm begging you.
- Well,

04:24.229 --> 04:30.282
um, I did think the characters
were a tiny bit unlikeable.

04:31.277 --> 04:34.531
- That's more like it. Noted.
- And it was a little slow.

04:34.739 --> 04:37.333
I found myself a little bored,
to be honest.

04:38.034 --> 04:41.254
- And I heart honesty.
- I also didn't know what was going on

04:41.454 --> 04:43.798
or where we were.
It wasn't explained well.

04:43.998 --> 04:46.968
I couldn't figure out the plot.
It was kind of insulting.

04:47.168 --> 04:50.138
And there was no specificity
in terms of time and place.

04:50.338 --> 04:54.093
- And where was the inciting incident?
- OK, OK, this is... Wow.

04:54.884 --> 04:56.227
Thank you, heh.

04:57.429 --> 04:59.727
But mostly I loved it.

04:59.931 --> 05:03.902
Now, get up and teach those summer
school kids how to write like you.

05:06.521 --> 05:11.448
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he loved the boat.

05:12.861 --> 05:18.539
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he didn't know just how evil.

05:18.742 --> 05:20.415
The boat was evil,

05:21.119 --> 05:24.293
but it was an acceptable level of evil.

05:24.497 --> 05:28.377
Chapter one. The sea-faring vessel,
<i>The Schooner,</i> was evil.

05:33.798 --> 05:35.550
Ah. It's getting there.

05:39.429 --> 05:44.151
Jesus. I've come full circle.
How very, very utterly depressing.

05:46.936 --> 05:49.359
What's up, amigo? Hey.

05:49.564 --> 05:51.942
- You're not my dealer.
- No, I'm Clint...

05:52.150 --> 05:55.905
- Hey, you don't sell shrooms do you?
- No. I'm Clint Hadson.

05:56.112 --> 05:57.830
<i>Is that Hudson?</i>

05:59.073 --> 06:01.701
- Hadson.
- Yeah, it's him. I'll let him in.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.919
- Oh. So that's a no on the shrooms?
- Right.

06:23.598 --> 06:24.895
Excuse me.

06:25.099 --> 06:27.227
I'm having trouble...

06:44.536 --> 06:46.288
Don't you forget, you're grounded.

06:46.496 --> 06:48.669
When school's over
you come straight home.

06:48.873 --> 06:51.217
- Fuck you, Mum.
- Oh, yeah? Fuck you.

06:51.793 --> 06:55.047
- I'm just gonna miss you so much.
- Can't I take it off?

06:55.255 --> 06:57.383
No. The playground is a war zone.

07:01.135 --> 07:03.263
- Watch it.
- Sorry. Didn't see you there.

07:03.471 --> 07:06.850
Well, maybe you should take in
your surroundings more.

07:07.350 --> 07:08.977
Yeah.

07:15.108 --> 07:16.826
- Mr. Hudson.
- Hadson.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.949
- Hi. Uh, call me Clint.
- Righteous.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.121
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

07:21.322 --> 07:24.292
Mrs. Kenner is down with the flu,
or maybe she's pregnant.

07:24.492 --> 07:26.620
She is Mormon, so that's a possibility.

07:26.828 --> 07:29.957
I'm vice principal Simms.
Principal Hodges is in the Bahamas.

07:30.164 --> 07:31.461
You know what they say.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.340
When the cat's away, the vice principal
becomes acting principal.

07:34.544 --> 07:35.716
I forgot they say that.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.797
Teacher's lounge is across the way.

07:38.006 --> 07:40.976
Go get a cup of joe.
It's not strong enough for my taste.

07:41.175 --> 07:45.021
To deal with these terrors I need
the high-octane stuff. Isn't that right?

07:45.221 --> 07:47.474
Heh, she's hilarious.
A lot of personal tragedy.

07:47.682 --> 07:51.312
Come on in to this office.
Pull up a ball chair.

07:51.519 --> 07:53.567
Got a cell phone?

07:54.439 --> 07:55.736
Um, yeah.

07:55.940 --> 07:58.363
- I'm gonna have to take it.
- Are you serious?

07:58.568 --> 08:02.323
Yep. This is a no cell-phone campus.
We can't ask the kids to give up

08:02.530 --> 08:06.376
something we're not willing to.
So hand over that crackberry.

08:07.827 --> 08:12.424
Booyah. Now, I gotta warn you,
I run a pretty tight ship.

08:12.624 --> 08:14.797
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

08:15.001 --> 08:18.801
Heh, it's funny you should say that.
I'm actually writing a book about a ship.

08:19.005 --> 08:21.303
Well, it's more of a boat.
I have it with me.

08:21.507 --> 08:24.886
If you're asking me to describe
my pedagogical "philosophy"

08:25.094 --> 08:27.563
- I'm not.
- Some charter schools out of Boston

08:27.764 --> 08:31.143
are "absolutely" "revolutionising"
"education."

08:31.351 --> 08:33.479
I'm not sure you know
how air quotes work.

08:33.686 --> 08:36.360
I wanna bring these kids back
to a pre-digital era.

08:36.563 --> 08:40.740
No cell phones, and I don't care
if it's raining labradoodles,

08:40.943 --> 08:43.413
I wanna get those kids outside
during recess.

08:43.613 --> 08:46.457
Heck, I'll lock them out.
And I will do that.

08:46.658 --> 08:50.458
Now, here's a map of the school.
Mrs. Kenner is in Room 12.

08:50.662 --> 08:55.259
Oh, I don't need that.
I actually used to go here. Class of '88.

08:55.458 --> 08:59.679
Hey, you know what that is?
That's out of sight.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.348
- All right.
- Shouldn't joke about guns though.

09:02.548 --> 09:03.845
- No.
- Not in a school.

09:04.050 --> 09:05.552
- Yeah.
- That's not funny.

09:07.428 --> 09:10.432
My partner's name is David.
He is awesome.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.770
He's a little bit older,
but really has this amazing body.

09:14.978 --> 09:16.855
If I'm being completely honest,

09:17.063 --> 09:20.567
he does have these fantastic balls
that I just love to play with.

09:20.775 --> 09:24.325
They're firmer and fuzzier, so...

09:25.863 --> 09:30.539
Heh, tennis partner.
Heh, David's my tennis partner. Heh.

09:34.622 --> 09:37.626
Hi there. Um, you know which
one of these is Mrs. Kenner's?

09:37.834 --> 09:40.383
Buddy, I don't know
what that bitch drinks out of.

09:40.586 --> 09:44.090
Here's what I do know.
I know that this is a rape button.

09:44.298 --> 09:47.472
It emits a shit-crazy alarm
that will inform local police,

09:47.677 --> 09:52.023
who'll arrive within two minutes should
you decide to get touchy and/or feely.

09:52.223 --> 09:54.942
Wanna know why I have a rape button?
Don't answer.

09:55.143 --> 09:58.647
Because the State of Illinois
doesn't trust the citizenry enough

09:58.855 --> 10:01.984
to pass safe, sensible,
conceal and carry laws.

10:02.191 --> 10:03.864
OK.

10:04.861 --> 10:06.204
So any of these then?

10:12.785 --> 10:15.584
Hm. She's a little tightly wound, huh?

10:31.095 --> 10:32.972
Oh, my God.

10:33.181 --> 10:35.855
Lucy? Lucy McCormick?

10:36.059 --> 10:38.153
- It's Clint Hadson.
- Oh, my God.

10:38.352 --> 10:41.606
- Wow, what are you doing here?
- I'm subbing for Mrs. Kenner.

10:41.981 --> 10:44.404
Oh, my God. Amazing.

10:44.609 --> 10:46.327
I heard you lived in New York.

10:46.527 --> 10:48.575
Yeah, I did. In Brooklyn.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.954
But now I'm in town for a while.
Staying at Charman's.

10:52.158 --> 10:54.160
Oh.

10:54.368 --> 10:56.837
- Who's Charman?
- My mum.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.508
But it's the guesthouse, so it's...

11:01.793 --> 11:03.386
So you're a teacher now?

11:04.003 --> 11:06.301
No. Well, I mean yes.

11:06.506 --> 11:12.058
I subbed a little in New York,
but I'm a writer.

11:12.261 --> 11:13.763
That's great.

11:15.681 --> 11:18.525
God, it's a scorcher out there, huh?

11:18.726 --> 11:20.273
Unseasonably warm.

11:21.979 --> 11:23.322
Yeah.

11:25.066 --> 11:27.910
Uh, Wade, have you met Clint?

11:28.903 --> 11:32.749
I have not. Wade Johnson. Pleased
to meet you with meat to please you.

11:32.949 --> 11:37.671
Actually, we kind of met earlier.
You parked me in.

11:38.663 --> 11:41.633
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's... It's fine.

11:41.833 --> 11:45.508
It's just that, um, you parked so close
that I couldn't get out of my car.

11:45.711 --> 11:47.713
My truck's got a dual real wheel.

11:49.507 --> 11:52.807
- I'm sorry?
- Dual real wheel.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.183
Dual real... Dual real...

11:55.388 --> 11:59.234
Dual real real. Dual real...

12:00.476 --> 12:01.898
Dual real wheel.

12:03.771 --> 12:07.446
Dual real... Real real.

12:07.650 --> 12:11.951
It's got a dual real wheel.
Dual real wheel. Dual real...

12:13.114 --> 12:15.833
- Dual real.
- I don't understand.

12:16.033 --> 12:20.209
It's got two extra wheels
on the back part of it.

12:21.122 --> 12:22.715
Dual rear...

12:22.915 --> 12:26.636
So, Clint, heard tell you were a writer,
hmm?

12:26.836 --> 12:31.216
- What have you written?
- Ah. Nothing that you've read, yet.

12:31.924 --> 12:33.892
I'm actually working on
my first novel.

12:34.093 --> 12:36.016
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.314
Oh, yeah, well, that's actually
why I'm home.

12:38.514 --> 12:42.894
You know, just to hunker down
and bang out that story.

12:43.102 --> 12:45.901
But, uh, I need a few shekels.

12:47.690 --> 12:49.613
Shekels.

12:50.026 --> 12:51.494
- Hebrew for...
- Doug.

12:51.694 --> 12:54.493
...currency. Yeah. OK.

12:55.239 --> 12:57.867
- Wow. Good for you. That's so exciting.
- Thanks.

12:58.075 --> 12:59.827
What's it about?

13:00.036 --> 13:02.164
Oh. Uh, well, it's a horror novel.

13:02.371 --> 13:04.794
Um, it's about a guy who buys a boat,

13:05.625 --> 13:08.845
but the boat turns out
to be possessed.

13:10.004 --> 13:11.972
Like <i>Christine.</i>

13:13.132 --> 13:15.385
- I'm sorry?
- <i>Christine</i> by Stephen King.

13:15.593 --> 13:18.062
The guy buys a car
and it's possessed.

13:19.180 --> 13:23.435
- Um, but this is about a boat.
- So it's like <i>Speed 2?</i>

13:25.311 --> 13:26.608
Starring...?

13:26.812 --> 13:30.032
Sandra Bullock, yes, of course, and...

13:31.567 --> 13:33.695
- Keanu Reeves?
- Jason Patric.

13:33.903 --> 13:36.577
- I am the biggest Jason Patric fan.
- Jason Patric, heh.

13:36.781 --> 13:40.081
- <i>Lost Boys.</i> Kiefer.
- "They're not lost, they're vampires."

13:43.371 --> 13:44.971
- They got lost.
- All right. Let's roll.

13:46.707 --> 13:51.133
Your classroom is actually right next
to mine. I can walk you if you want.

13:51.337 --> 13:54.181
Um, yeah. That would be great.

13:59.971 --> 14:04.693
You are so fucking ugly.

14:05.226 --> 14:08.321
If my butthole had a butthole,
that's what you'd look like.

14:08.521 --> 14:12.071
Yeah, you look like my butthole's ass.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.118
You look like you got chicken pox.

14:14.318 --> 14:16.571
If chicken pox was made out
of haemorrhoids.

14:16.779 --> 14:19.874
Yeah, if chicken pox
was made out of my ass.

14:20.074 --> 14:23.169
And here we are.
Fourth grade, that's me, heh.

14:23.369 --> 14:27.249
And you're right up there. Good luck.
Holler if you need anything.

14:27.456 --> 14:30.585
Or you can ask Wade.
The athletic office is right down there.

14:30.793 --> 14:34.218
Yeah, what's with that guy?
He seems like a bit of a dick.

14:34.422 --> 14:36.675
Heh. He's my boyfriend.

14:37.258 --> 14:39.556
Sorry, I'm late.
I was helping a friend out.

14:39.885 --> 14:44.516
Eric, what is that?
You just put that right down now.

14:51.564 --> 14:53.658
Hey, did somebody order a sub?

14:55.484 --> 14:57.282
Tough crowd, heh.

15:01.824 --> 15:03.542
My uncle's cancer

15:03.743 --> 15:05.416
took his stomach.

15:05.619 --> 15:08.247
But his divorce

15:09.248 --> 15:10.875
took his mind.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.757
Anyhoo...

15:14.295 --> 15:16.923
That was my weekend.
Let's begin class.

15:17.131 --> 15:20.101
Maybe we were created
by an all-knowing God

15:20.301 --> 15:23.180
who sent down his only son
to die for us,

15:23.387 --> 15:26.266
or maybe we were monkey people
who sat around

15:26.474 --> 15:29.694
crapping in each other's mouths
until one day we were like:

15:29.894 --> 15:33.990
"I don't like all this hair.
Just on my head and crotch, please."

15:34.607 --> 15:35.904
Who can say?

15:36.108 --> 15:41.330
I can't, because the State of Illinois
doesn't allow me to, Hank.

15:43.074 --> 15:47.580
I know I'm the substitute,
but I'm also a friend.

15:47.787 --> 15:51.041
It wasn't so long ago that
I was sitting exactly where you are.

15:51.248 --> 15:53.467
In fact,
don't tell those other teachers,

15:53.667 --> 15:56.045
but I want you to call me
by my first name.

16:03.094 --> 16:05.096
- "Cunt"?
- What?

16:05.304 --> 16:07.477
No. You can't say...

16:09.183 --> 16:11.151
OK, no. Uh, my name is Clint.

16:11.769 --> 16:15.899
You know what?
Just call me Mr. Hadson.

16:17.024 --> 16:21.621
I'm not really a teacher.
I'm only substituting to pay the bills.

16:21.821 --> 16:25.792
I'm actually writing a horror novel.
Pretty cool, huh?

16:25.991 --> 16:27.288
Yeah, real cool, asshole.

16:29.161 --> 16:31.004
- Excuse me? What's your name?
- Patriot.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.173
- He got held back.
- Shut up.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.259
Your name is Patriot?

16:36.001 --> 16:37.378
That's right.

16:37.586 --> 16:39.554
I was born on September 11th.

16:39.755 --> 16:42.133
God sent me on that day.

16:42.341 --> 16:44.639
That's why on my 18th birthday,

16:44.844 --> 16:48.098
I'm joining the Marines
just to kick some towel-head ass.

16:49.390 --> 16:52.018
Wow. A lot to unpack there.

16:52.351 --> 16:55.025
First off, could you keep
the language down, please?

16:55.229 --> 16:56.947
Otherwise, I'll send you outside.

16:57.148 --> 17:00.778
Yeah, while you were talking,
I just looked at like a hundred vaginas.

17:00.985 --> 17:02.953
- All right. Give me that.
- Why?

17:03.404 --> 17:06.203
You're not allowed to have it.
Your principal told me.

17:06.406 --> 17:09.627
How about I start crying
and suggest to my parents

17:09.827 --> 17:12.626
about how you touched me
inappropriately?

17:15.833 --> 17:20.839
Wait. You didn't happen to write
on a Prius this morning, did you?

17:23.924 --> 17:29.397
OK. So I actually have the first
draught of my new novel with me.

17:29.889 --> 17:32.859
Who would like to come up here
and read the first chapter?

17:33.058 --> 17:35.152
And then you guys can
give me some notes.

17:35.352 --> 17:37.229
- Great. What's your name?
- Ahem. Douche.

17:39.231 --> 17:41.529
- Calvin.
- Calvin, come on down.

17:48.365 --> 17:50.163
Go ahead.

17:50.659 --> 17:54.630
"Chapter one. Trent always loved boats,
but when he spent his life savings

17:54.830 --> 17:58.710
on the <i>Anna Marie,</i> he didn't know
he'd just charted a course to evil.

17:58.918 --> 18:00.920
It was an easy money transaction..."

18:01.128 --> 18:02.880
You'd be good in a horror novel.

18:08.969 --> 18:10.562
Hey.

18:11.305 --> 18:13.023
You listening to me?

18:31.033 --> 18:33.127
All right. Everyone calm down.
Stay here.

18:33.327 --> 18:36.581
I'm gonna take Patriot to the nurse.
Come on. Come on.

18:36.997 --> 18:38.340
Don't be a baby.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.757
Come on, Patriot. Let me see.
Come on.

18:45.297 --> 18:48.972
This is going to need stitches.
There's nothing I can do about it here.

18:49.176 --> 18:52.271
- He's gonna have to go to the hospital.
- That's OK.

18:52.471 --> 18:53.848
Patriot can handle it.

18:54.056 --> 18:55.899
Right, Patriot? You're a Marine.

19:20.749 --> 19:23.093
Beautiful, beautiful shrooms.

19:32.219 --> 19:35.894
So one of my students tried
to eat another one's face off.

19:36.473 --> 19:39.443
How's your day going?
I'm really sorry about this morning.

19:39.643 --> 19:42.442
- What happened?
- Uh, I called your boyfriend a dick.

19:42.646 --> 19:45.616
I didn't know you guys were dating
and now I feel awkward.

19:45.816 --> 19:47.944
No, in your classroom.
What happened?

19:48.152 --> 19:51.031
Oh. This girl went ape-shit on this kid.
She was biting him.

19:51.238 --> 19:54.492
- I sent him to the nurse.
- Did you send her to the principal?

19:54.700 --> 19:57.920
You kidding? I wanted to give
her a high-five. That kid's a dick.

20:19.808 --> 20:21.310
Hey.

20:22.603 --> 20:24.480
You bit my friend's face.

20:27.274 --> 20:29.652
What, are you sick or something?

20:30.611 --> 20:31.703
Hey, you bitch.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.911
I just wanted to say to them, like,

20:35.115 --> 20:37.914
"Guys, I'm a writer
who moved here from New York City.

20:38.118 --> 20:40.621
"Like, I'm way cooler than
your regular teacher."

20:40.829 --> 20:44.333
- This day could've been super fun.
- Kids are always rough on subs.

20:44.541 --> 20:47.215
This is different from
what we were like growing up.

20:47.419 --> 20:49.012
They're, like, not even kids.

21:01.809 --> 21:03.402
The fuck?

21:05.187 --> 21:06.689
He can't be that funny.

22:22.097 --> 22:24.520
So single. Ooh-la-la.

22:26.059 --> 22:27.902
Yeah, I'm such a catch.

22:28.562 --> 22:32.283
You'll be beating off the women
in Fort Chicken.

22:32.483 --> 22:34.485
Oh, yeah. Fort Chicken girls.

22:34.693 --> 22:36.195
Yeah, the hottest.

22:43.243 --> 22:45.291
What is happening here, kids?

22:52.753 --> 22:54.096
Goddamnit.

23:01.094 --> 23:02.516
What is wrong with me?

23:07.226 --> 23:10.196
Oh, no, you didn't.

23:11.146 --> 23:13.569
<i>Vice Principal Simms?</i>

23:14.858 --> 23:16.531
Yeah, you're go for Simms.

23:16.735 --> 23:18.112
I'm under some

23:18.320 --> 23:20.414
medication for a medical condition

23:20.614 --> 23:24.414
So I may not be seeing things
correctly.

23:24.618 --> 23:30.216
<i>But I'm pretty sure I might be seeing
some of your students</i>

23:30.415 --> 23:34.295
possibly eating Mr. Peterson.

23:37.214 --> 23:39.216
<i>Again, it could be the medication.</i>

23:45.973 --> 23:49.398
OK. All right. Shaw's over.

23:49.601 --> 23:54.778
Hey, I may be acting principal,
but you all are acting crazy.

23:54.982 --> 23:56.484
Hey, don't... Don't...

23:57.985 --> 23:59.862
I have bursitis.
I have bursitis in my elbow.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.619
Who...? Who is your homeroom?

24:31.435 --> 24:33.108
Get... Get out of there.

24:34.855 --> 24:37.608
- It's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

24:37.816 --> 24:39.159
Oh, look. Carnage.

24:45.449 --> 24:48.749
- Somebody call the police.
- Wait. Oh, hey, my button.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.926
Come on, Johnson.
What the fuck is happening?

25:00.797 --> 25:04.176
What the fuck is happening?

25:06.929 --> 25:09.648
Wait, there's Wade. Wade.

25:11.683 --> 25:13.606
Oh, God.

25:17.814 --> 25:19.691
All right, listen up.

25:21.068 --> 25:22.661
I'd back off if I was you.

25:22.861 --> 25:26.240
I was an all-state football champion,
y'all are a bunch of kids.

25:26.949 --> 25:31.250
Look, we've all wanted to do that
to Vice Principal Simms, OK?

25:31.453 --> 25:33.171
I know I have.

25:33.956 --> 25:35.333
But a...

25:35.540 --> 25:38.043
A line has been crossed.

25:41.088 --> 25:44.058
You can't eat the teachers, man.

25:46.134 --> 25:48.387
Calm down right now.

25:59.856 --> 26:01.449
Come on, Johnson.

26:01.650 --> 26:03.323
Run, Johnson.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.878
They attacked the vice principal.

26:14.079 --> 26:15.922
<i>Ma 'am, you need to calm down.</i>

26:16.123 --> 26:18.592
Then they started chas...
Hello? Hello?

26:29.886 --> 26:32.014
The phones are dead.

26:33.724 --> 26:35.818
Those kids are fast.

26:36.018 --> 26:39.192
I was twice voted running back
of the year,

26:39.396 --> 26:43.071
Cary County,
and should've went a third year,

26:44.359 --> 26:45.702
but it was political...

26:45.902 --> 26:49.076
- What the fuck are you trying to say?
- Do not go out there. Those kids...

26:51.992 --> 26:54.461
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no, no. It's Angela.

26:54.661 --> 26:57.210
Hi, Angela. It's me, Mr. Lacey.

27:01.001 --> 27:03.754
Oh, there's Dave. Dave's coming.

27:05.589 --> 27:07.262
See, everything's gonna be fine.

27:07.758 --> 27:09.226
Shit, man. Five-0.

27:16.099 --> 27:19.228
Fuck it. I ain't going down.

27:19.436 --> 27:21.564
All right, kids. Settle down.

27:21.772 --> 27:23.695
You little guys need to tell me
what's going on.

27:27.069 --> 27:30.448
You all eat cherry pie for lunch
or something? What's going on?

27:32.282 --> 27:36.162
I'm here to help. Think of me
just like Batman. I'm a helper.

27:45.128 --> 27:46.675
What the fuck?!

28:04.481 --> 28:08.076
- Fuck this. I gotta do something.
- No. You can't go back out there.

28:08.276 --> 28:10.620
- No. Let me alone.
- Wade?

28:14.407 --> 28:16.535
Oh, my God.

28:16.743 --> 28:18.211
Oh, God.

28:21.498 --> 28:22.841
What the fuck, freak?

28:25.627 --> 28:27.880
- He's gonna bite your face.
- I can see that.

28:28.088 --> 28:31.638
He'll tear your goddamn face off.
You'll look like that chimp woman.

28:33.301 --> 28:35.144
You're achieving nothing.

28:36.304 --> 28:39.524
- Help me!
- Let me burn his face!

28:47.566 --> 28:49.159
Who is that lady?

28:51.611 --> 28:53.864
- Anybody have a key?
- Probably not.

28:56.366 --> 28:58.710
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:58.910 --> 29:02.210
- We can't just leave her there.
- Come on.

29:04.708 --> 29:06.802
Move. Move.

29:07.502 --> 29:09.175
Come on.

29:09.421 --> 29:12.550
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Follow me. I do CrossFit.

29:12.757 --> 29:14.805
- No, don't do it.
- You sons of bitches.

29:16.303 --> 29:18.271
Fuck.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.398
- Go, go, go.
- Wade, what...?

29:24.019 --> 29:25.817
In here.

29:28.315 --> 29:32.115
- Kill him! I hate it! Kill him!
- No. Wait. He's not like the others.

29:32.319 --> 29:35.539
And I'm not saying that because
you're the only black student.

29:35.739 --> 29:37.537
- Differences make life beautiful.
- What's going on?

29:37.741 --> 29:41.587
- Kill him!
- No, wait. Tracy's right.

29:41.786 --> 29:45.757
Calvin, are you OK? You don't have
a thirst for blood or anything?

29:45.957 --> 29:48.176
Why would I?
I'm studying for my test.

29:48.376 --> 29:50.799
- Great. How's it going?
- OK, fuck the test.

29:51.004 --> 29:54.053
- We gotta seek out higher ground.
- OK. Come on, Calvin.

29:54.257 --> 29:56.100
You come with us.

30:06.770 --> 30:08.363
We're clear. In here, come on.

30:08.563 --> 30:10.816
- Come on.
- Close the door. Close the door.

30:11.024 --> 30:12.367
- Close the door.
- Get it.

30:12.567 --> 30:15.241
- Hey, hey. Is everyone OK?
- I think so. Yes.

30:15.445 --> 30:18.039
- Are you OK?
- Can we please take a moment...?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.163
Get in here. Come on. Come on.

30:20.367 --> 30:22.165
She has blisters.

30:23.036 --> 30:26.631
We're safe. The door is locked.
They can't get through these windows.

30:26.831 --> 30:28.424
The phone's out in here too.

30:28.625 --> 30:31.925
Can somebody explain to me
what is going on? What is going on?!

30:32.128 --> 30:33.471
I blame rap music.

30:33.672 --> 30:36.676
I hated my teachers in school.
But I never tried to kill them.

30:36.883 --> 30:39.102
- They got cooties.
- What?

30:40.845 --> 30:44.850
That's what they're always saying that
girl Shelly has. Cooties. She's dirty.

30:45.517 --> 30:48.487
- Calvin, that's not very nice.
- No, he's right.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.904
In a... In a way.
If you'll follow me, you'll see...

30:53.108 --> 30:55.281
- You're not hurt, are you?
- No, I'm good.

30:55.485 --> 30:58.785
...she has the raised blisters of a vi...

30:59.781 --> 31:01.124
A virus.

31:01.324 --> 31:04.077
I'm OK. We're safe here, right?

31:04.286 --> 31:07.290
Everybody feels OK?
And we're all safe.

31:07.497 --> 31:10.501
It's pretty interesting actually.

31:12.168 --> 31:14.671
I knew we'd work it all out, heh.

31:24.931 --> 31:26.899
I would love to get inside your head.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.522
Oh.

31:29.227 --> 31:32.026
She's gone to commit murder
somewhere else.

31:34.899 --> 31:36.697
All right, ladies, here's the plan.

31:36.901 --> 31:39.404
We get down on that ledge,
jump to the ground,

31:39.612 --> 31:43.082
hightail it like linebackers
to our cars, boom.

31:43.283 --> 31:45.081
I thought you tried to outrun them.

31:45.285 --> 31:48.755
- You said they were too fast for you.
- Yeah, but that was before

31:48.955 --> 31:50.457
I had a weapon.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.002
A violin?

31:54.878 --> 31:58.132
Not just a violin.
It's an instrument of death.

31:59.049 --> 32:01.097
I propose we create
a symphony of death.

32:01.301 --> 32:04.475
Everyone grab an instrument.
Here. You take this.

32:04.679 --> 32:08.024
- Oh, yeah, that'll be real effective.
- I'm offering leadership.

32:08.224 --> 32:11.899
What are you offering, besides
throwing hot pots of coffee at people,

32:12.103 --> 32:16.199
or a stupid book no one wants to read
about a guy who wants to fuck a boat?

32:16.399 --> 32:18.743
It's not about a guy
who wants to fuck a boat.

32:18.943 --> 32:22.493
- It's about obsession and possession...
- He wants to fuck the boat.

32:22.697 --> 32:24.620
- Listen...
- Listen, Stevie King...

32:24.824 --> 32:28.203
There's an invention called a cell phone
that your school confiscated.

32:28.411 --> 32:31.085
We need to get to the office,
grab our phones

32:31.289 --> 32:34.168
and call someone who can help
quarantine these kids.

32:34.376 --> 32:36.845
We're in a lockdown
in case you haven't noticed.

32:37.045 --> 32:40.845
We have been breached. There are
little cootie kids out in the hallway

32:41.049 --> 32:44.269
who will fucking rip your face off
with their little teeth.

32:44.469 --> 32:47.222
- Well, shit...
- Their big teeth haven't come in yet.

32:53.645 --> 32:55.739
You carry on
with your symphony of death.

32:55.939 --> 32:58.658
I'll sneak around the school
where there aren't kids.

32:58.858 --> 33:02.112
Oh, you sneak around, huh?
Sneak around like a little hobbit.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.823
I'm taking the fight to them
like a fucking orc.

33:05.031 --> 33:07.125
That's the difference
between you and me.

33:07.325 --> 33:10.374
I don't wanna scurry.
I don't scurry like a common squirrel.

33:10.578 --> 33:13.832
Both of you be quiet! The only way
we're gonna get anywhere

33:14.040 --> 33:18.261
is if we turn our frowns upside down
and try to get along. OK?

33:18.461 --> 33:21.385
You know how I beat
the terrorists after 9/11?

33:21.589 --> 33:24.593
- With a positive attitude.
- It's true. She did.

33:26.636 --> 33:30.436
I don't think going back for our
cell phones is necessarily a great idea.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.486
Even though it's wonderful that you're
trying. We welcome all suggestions.

33:34.686 --> 33:37.235
- Wait, I just thought of something.
- What is it?

33:37.439 --> 33:41.069
Um, it's just an idea for <i>Keel Them All.</i>
The hero's trapped on the boat

33:41.276 --> 33:45.326
and my mum doesn't understand why
he wouldn't just call for help. I got it.

33:45.530 --> 33:47.532
He left his phone on the dock.

33:47.740 --> 33:49.868
What are you talking about?

33:50.076 --> 33:52.078
Oh, sorry. My book.

33:52.620 --> 33:54.042
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:54.831 --> 33:57.801
- Unbelievable.
- Your book is called <i>Keel Them All?</i>

33:58.001 --> 34:01.505
OK, can we convene the book club
a little later on, please?

34:01.713 --> 34:06.890
Wade, I think maybe your idea is
maybe an unwise idea also.

34:07.093 --> 34:09.972
- Seriously, Lucy?
- I'm sorry.

34:10.638 --> 34:12.231
So, what do you propose?

34:12.431 --> 34:15.436
That we wait here until 3.00.

34:17.603 --> 34:21.279
Um, OK, what happens at 3.00?

34:21.483 --> 34:24.202
At 3.00 the parents will come
to pick up their kids.

34:24.402 --> 34:26.655
We get on the roof
and signal them for help.

34:26.862 --> 34:30.458
- I like that idea. It's a good one.
- Better than your fucking idea.

34:30.658 --> 34:34.036
- Anything's better than your idea.
- Oh.

34:34.579 --> 34:36.377
Clint, are you OK? That sounds...

34:36.581 --> 34:38.754
Yeah, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.335
What happened to your arm?

34:40.793 --> 34:42.966
- Oh, it's nothing...
- Ah.

34:43.170 --> 34:46.141
- Oh, shit.
- What? It's just a scratch.

34:46.341 --> 34:48.469
- He's infected.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

34:48.676 --> 34:51.600
You got cooties, motherfucker.
Time for a quarantine.

34:51.804 --> 34:54.398
- No. I'm feeling fine.
- You're coming with me.

34:54.599 --> 34:56.943
- Stop resisting. Don't resist.
- I feel fine.

34:57.143 --> 35:00.397
- Quarantine.
- Wade. Wade.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.284
Let me out, asshole.

35:05.401 --> 35:07.529
Nobody else go in there.

35:11.950 --> 35:13.998
I'm going in.

35:14.202 --> 35:16.421
Doug, don't... I don't care-.

35:32.011 --> 35:34.091
<i>We have
some breaking news developing</i>

35:34.222 --> 35:37.351
<i>in the suburb of Fort Chicken
this morning...</i>

35:37.559 --> 35:39.982
- What if he...?
- Excuse me. Listen up, please.

35:40.186 --> 35:42.063
Could everybody please listen up?

35:46.109 --> 35:49.158
Guys, don't make me ask again.
Quiet. Quiet, please.

35:51.114 --> 35:53.412
- Please, be quiet.
- None of us are talking.

35:53.616 --> 35:55.414
Rebekka.

35:55.618 --> 35:56.961
Quiet, please.

35:58.621 --> 36:01.670
Thank you. It is my opinion

36:01.874 --> 36:04.502
- that Clint has been infected with...
- I knew it.

36:04.711 --> 36:07.510
- ...whatever those kids have out there.
- Oh, my God.

36:07.714 --> 36:10.217
It doesn't seem to be
affecting him the same way.

36:10.425 --> 36:13.554
He's only exhibiting
mild stomach-flu symptoms.

36:13.761 --> 36:20.315
Nausea, cramps, a little diarrhoea,
vomiting, mild anal leakage.

36:20.518 --> 36:25.615
But it is my hypothesis
that we are safe from him for now.

36:25.815 --> 36:29.490
He will not attempt to murder us
or tear us limb from limb.

36:29.694 --> 36:32.197
- He just has the flu.
- Hold on a second.

36:32.405 --> 36:34.874
How do you...?
How do you know all this?

36:35.283 --> 36:38.002
Well, Rebekka,
I just examined his fluids

36:38.202 --> 36:42.378
with two of histories oldest
scientific instruments. My hands.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.755
Doug.

36:44.959 --> 36:48.008
- Heh, don't worry. I'm wearing gloves.
- Oh, no, you're not.

36:48.212 --> 36:50.135
- No.
- No, you're not.

36:51.799 --> 36:53.597
- Damn it, Doug.
- Keep it together.

36:53.801 --> 36:55.644
I see.

36:56.137 --> 36:57.889
OK, OK, it doesn't matter.

36:58.097 --> 37:00.270
Listen, the sub stays locked
in the closet.

37:00.475 --> 37:04.025
He gets a clean bill of health at 3.00,
then we'll talk.

38:03.538 --> 38:05.290
Go time.

38:06.165 --> 38:09.009
- Keep your distance, Grisham.
- There's vomit there.

38:09.210 --> 38:11.554
- Sorry. Watch your step.
- Are you all right?

38:11.754 --> 38:13.677
- How you feeling? Come on.
- Um, better.

38:13.881 --> 38:16.475
- OK. That's yours.
- Oh, thank you.

38:16.676 --> 38:18.349
Wait. Oh, I know that car.

38:18.553 --> 38:20.555
That's the PTA president,
Racer Dopkins' mum.

38:20.763 --> 38:22.686
She gets here early
to open the gates.

38:22.890 --> 38:24.642
- Hey, hey, over here!
- Hey!

38:24.851 --> 38:26.148
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:26.352 --> 38:27.774
Hey!

38:27.979 --> 38:30.573
- Call for help!
- Use the phone!

38:32.734 --> 38:35.829
This could fall apart.
I'm just thinking about the children.

38:36.028 --> 38:37.530
- Hey!
- 911!

38:37.739 --> 38:39.833
Those little bastards
are gonna kill her.

38:40.032 --> 38:42.205
- She's gonna be fine.
- Wait, there he is.

38:42.410 --> 38:44.128
- No, no.
- Don't open the door.

38:44.328 --> 38:48.504
- She doesn't even see him.
- Don't let him in! Don't let him in!

38:50.752 --> 38:52.971
Who's Mummy's angel?
Who's Mummy's angel?

38:53.171 --> 38:55.390
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

38:55.590 --> 38:57.308
- Get out of the car!
- No!

38:57.508 --> 39:00.432
- You tell Simms that $300 won't cut it.
- Mrs. Dobkins!

39:00.636 --> 39:02.309
Mrs. Dobkins, don't do it!

39:02.513 --> 39:04.436
God, Steve. Don't even give me that.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.768
I know what's going on
in the school 24/7.

39:06.976 --> 39:08.193
Come on, Racer. Let's go.

39:09.854 --> 39:11.934
You wanna go to soccer practise
or not, honey puckle?

39:12.523 --> 39:16.278
I'm not gonna be the one holding the
book at the book ride again this year.

39:16.486 --> 39:18.363
No. You...

39:19.906 --> 39:23.376
Racer, what the hell are you doing
to your brother back there now?

39:29.624 --> 39:32.628
- They go right for the face.
- I told you.

39:32.835 --> 39:35.679
We have to warn the others.
They'll be here any second.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.427
They'll massacre the other parents.

39:38.883 --> 39:39.930
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

39:40.218 --> 39:41.515
- Oh, my God!
- Help me.

39:41.719 --> 39:43.938
- She's not one of them.
- How do you know?

39:44.138 --> 39:46.891
Look at her face.
It's not covered in pox.

39:47.767 --> 39:49.815
- Help her.
- Oh, God. They're coming.

39:50.019 --> 39:51.441
They're coming.

39:52.146 --> 39:53.318
They're coming.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.572
They're getting up on the roof.
They're in the tree.

39:57.777 --> 39:59.620
Move!

40:00.112 --> 40:02.160
- Come on!
- Go, go, go!

40:02.365 --> 40:04.538
- Where do we go?
- Go, go, go.

40:04.742 --> 40:06.540
To the auditorium.

40:06.744 --> 40:09.623
Don't give up. Let's go.

40:13.209 --> 40:15.257
Move, move, move.

40:19.423 --> 40:22.427
Help! Get it off me! Get it off!

41:08.264 --> 41:10.232
Wade, I...

41:20.818 --> 41:23.697
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41:24.155 --> 41:28.035
Tammy, why don't you and Calvin
come on over here with me?

41:28.242 --> 41:31.337
- That guy always cheated off me.
- Calvin.

41:31.537 --> 41:34.211
I'll make sure
all the doors are secure.

41:42.757 --> 41:45.681
Why...? Why is his blood black?

41:46.636 --> 41:48.559
I don't know.

41:49.305 --> 41:50.898
That's what I wanna find out.

41:51.891 --> 41:53.689
I think I'm gonna dissect him.

41:55.269 --> 41:58.864
Hey, look at us.
We're fine. We're fine.

41:59.065 --> 42:02.695
You know, we're still us, because...
You know why?

42:02.902 --> 42:06.623
Because none of us got bitten
or scratched.

42:07.239 --> 42:09.162
I did.

42:11.369 --> 42:12.541
Oh.

42:15.539 --> 42:19.214
It's fine. We'll go to the washroom
and wash it out with soap

42:19.418 --> 42:22.171
so it won't get infected, OK?
What do you say?

42:30.388 --> 42:32.561
Oh, God.
I can't believe you're doing this.

42:32.765 --> 42:36.190
I can't believe boys pee in those.
I mean, that's disgusting.

42:36.394 --> 42:37.691
That's disgusting?

42:37.895 --> 42:41.616
It's not disgusting to have boys
staring at each other's penises?

42:41.816 --> 42:45.662
What's wrong with that?
OK, we got bigger things to worry about.

42:45.861 --> 42:47.613
Well, this is interesting.

42:47.822 --> 42:49.824
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

42:50.032 --> 42:52.410
- Oh, God.
- I'm gonna extract the brain.

42:52.618 --> 42:55.542
- Oh, that's just rude.
- Damn it.

42:57.748 --> 43:00.547
<i>The preliminary
reports have been confirmed.</i>

43:00.751 --> 43:04.096
<i>Children are for some reason
violently attacking their parents</i>

43:04.296 --> 43:06.298
<i>in front of Fort Chicken Elementary.</i>

43:06.507 --> 43:08.680
<i>We have reports of victims
around the city.</i>

43:08.884 --> 43:11.012
<i>Authorities have no idea
what is going on.</i>

43:11.220 --> 43:13.100
<i>Stay inside, stay in your cars,
do not go out...</i>

43:17.727 --> 43:21.322
<i>Dude, this is totally tripping me out.</i>

43:25.693 --> 43:28.116
Are you on shrooms too?

43:33.034 --> 43:34.707
Hey.

43:38.998 --> 43:42.923
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd really rather be left alone, Lucy.

43:44.879 --> 43:47.223
Wade, can we please talk?

43:47.423 --> 43:49.300
I don't wanna talk.

43:49.508 --> 43:51.351
I know you don't, but I do.

43:52.303 --> 43:55.102
Why don't you talk
to your boyfriend about it?

43:56.098 --> 43:58.817
Clint and I went to school together.

43:59.018 --> 44:01.316
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.897
I walked in this morning,

44:03.105 --> 44:06.405
the guy was fucking hitting on you
and you were eating it up.

44:06.609 --> 44:08.657
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

44:08.861 --> 44:10.534
You can't even deny it. Deny it.

44:11.489 --> 44:13.867
Clint and I were just talking.

44:14.283 --> 44:17.207
And I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I didn't mean to.

44:17.411 --> 44:20.381
- Oh.
- Look, I'm sorry.

44:20.581 --> 44:23.926
I know neither of us thought
this was how the day was gonna go

44:24.126 --> 44:26.629
- when we woke up this morning.
- No, we didn't.

44:26.837 --> 44:29.556
I thought today was gonna go
way different than this.

44:29.757 --> 44:33.261
You have no idea.
I bought you a ring yesterday, Lucy.

44:35.554 --> 44:41.232
Then I walk in and I see you laughing
and smiling at that little asshole.

44:42.019 --> 44:44.021
And you know what I thought?

44:44.980 --> 44:49.611
I thought, "Wow,
she looks so pretty when she smiles.

44:51.237 --> 44:54.616
"How come she never smiles at me
like that?"

44:57.785 --> 45:00.163
I'll talk to you later, Lucy.

45:04.291 --> 45:07.090
And go fuck yourself.

45:14.593 --> 45:16.561
Prognosis is not good.

45:19.098 --> 45:23.649
As you can see, most of the grey
and white matter has been...

45:23.894 --> 45:25.362
Rebekka, quiet please.

45:27.189 --> 45:30.489
Most of the grey and white matter
has been severely infected.

45:30.693 --> 45:33.993
It's showing the beginning stages
of necrosis and decomposition.

45:34.196 --> 45:36.745
All these black areas
are basically dead.

45:36.949 --> 45:40.374
I mean, they can run, jump, eat,
but they're not human anymore.

45:40.578 --> 45:44.299
- Not really.
- Once again, how do you know all this?

45:44.498 --> 45:48.924
I learned all about the brain when I had
a 6" spike lodged in my skull as a child.

45:49.128 --> 45:51.472
Which is the reason why,
you may have noticed,

45:51.672 --> 45:53.345
sometimes I use the wrong rowboat.

45:53.549 --> 45:56.348
- Word.
- Word.

45:56.886 --> 46:00.481
Now, bacteria can't cross
the blood brain barrier.

46:00.890 --> 46:04.485
So I'm thinking
this is more likely a virus.

46:05.728 --> 46:07.730
What kind of virus would do that?

46:08.355 --> 46:09.652
A pretty nasty one.

46:09.857 --> 46:12.451
Calvin said Shelly Lanker
was the first to bite.

46:12.651 --> 46:13.948
- Right?
- Yeah.

46:14.153 --> 46:17.032
What about Clint and Tamra?
All it did was make them sick.

46:17.239 --> 46:19.037
I have a theory about this.

46:19.241 --> 46:21.414
Hold on a moment.

46:23.287 --> 46:25.585
- Tamra?
- Yeah?

46:25.789 --> 46:28.258
- Have you achieved menses?
- What?

46:28.876 --> 46:30.173
No, he's...

46:30.377 --> 46:32.800
...asking you
if you've had your period yet.

46:33.547 --> 46:36.221
- Um, I really don't wanna say.
- You wear a bra, right?

46:36.425 --> 46:39.269
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

46:40.137 --> 46:42.936
I gave you an A in sex ed, Tamra.

46:43.140 --> 46:45.768
Little disappointed
you don't know what menses are.

46:45.976 --> 46:47.444
Why is sex ed always taught

46:47.645 --> 46:50.273
- by the creepiest teacher?
- Clint, quiet please.

46:50.481 --> 46:53.030
It seems the virus is susceptible
to androgens.

46:53.234 --> 46:56.113
The pre-pubescent body
has testosterone and oestrogen,

46:56.320 --> 46:59.540
but at puberty the body's glands
create a feedback cycle

46:59.740 --> 47:03.085
- that increases gonadotropins...
- What are you trying to say?

47:03.285 --> 47:06.539
Talk like a person. Please?

47:07.498 --> 47:11.924
The virus is only dangerous
if you haven't gone through puberty.

47:22.096 --> 47:25.066
- What's going on? How'd they do that?
- Everyone stay calm.

47:25.266 --> 47:28.270
Calvin. Oh, shit. Calvin.

47:28.477 --> 47:31.026
- Calvin.
- Over here, guys.

47:31.230 --> 47:32.982
Calvin? Wake up. Wake up.

47:33.190 --> 47:34.692
- Calvin.
- Quit slapping me.

47:34.900 --> 47:36.948
He's diabetic. He needs to eat.

47:37.152 --> 47:39.246
We need to get him a candy bar
or a soda.

47:39.446 --> 47:41.824
Wade, do you have any snack bars
or something?

47:42.032 --> 47:45.002
- I got creatine powder.
- He needs something with sugar.

47:45.202 --> 47:46.499
This body is a no-carb zone.

47:47.955 --> 47:49.127
What was that?

47:49.331 --> 47:53.381
Probably one of the demented children
that's been trying to murder us all day.

47:53.585 --> 47:55.007
It's coming from over there.

47:57.631 --> 47:59.975
- They're in the boiler room.
- They can't be.

48:00.175 --> 48:02.519
I've checked all these doors.
They're locked.

48:14.148 --> 48:15.695
Oh, my God. They have keys?

48:15.899 --> 48:17.776
You said they couldn't do stuff
like that.

48:17.985 --> 48:20.363
They're gonna get in.
We're all going to die.

48:20.571 --> 48:22.665
This can't be the end.
I'm not published.

48:22.865 --> 48:25.334
Wade, I thought about it
and I can't marry you.

48:29.621 --> 48:31.999
- Jesus, it's the fucking janitor.
- Hitachi?

48:32.207 --> 48:34.835
- What are you doing here?
- The lights are out.

48:37.296 --> 48:38.593
- We gotta move.
- Go.

48:38.797 --> 48:40.470
Come on!

48:47.431 --> 48:48.853
Move it, move it.

48:49.183 --> 48:51.151
Watch your step.

48:52.144 --> 48:54.192
What the hell?

48:54.855 --> 48:57.153
- You live down here?
- Yes.

48:57.691 --> 48:59.910
- Where are we?
- Oh, my God.

49:00.110 --> 49:04.490
We have a kid who needs help.
He's diabetic. Do you have any food?

49:09.078 --> 49:10.705
Seaweed.

49:11.038 --> 49:13.416
I'm afraid that won't work. No.

49:14.875 --> 49:16.377
The microwave.

49:16.585 --> 49:19.805
<i>This is
the emergency broadcast system</i>

49:20.005 --> 49:22.599
<i>for the township of Fort Chicken,
Illinois.</i>

49:22.800 --> 49:24.302
<i>Effective immediately,</i>

49:24.510 --> 49:27.980
<i>the mayor of Fort Chicken has
announced mandatory evacuations</i>

49:28.180 --> 49:30.433
<i>of neighbourhoods
east of Winslow Avenue.</i>

49:30.641 --> 49:34.942
<i>Authorities are reporting the spread
of a highly contagious virus.</i>

49:35.145 --> 49:36.522
<i>Reports say...</i>

49:39.441 --> 49:41.034
We're alone.

49:41.902 --> 49:44.826
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

50:03.132 --> 50:07.638
No. No, we're not. There's a snack
machine in the teacher's lounge, right?

50:07.845 --> 50:10.314
- Yeah.
- How many people can fit in your truck?

50:10.514 --> 50:15.645
Told you, it's a dual real wheel.
Dual real... It's a dual real whe...

50:15.853 --> 50:17.821
- Probably eight.
- Where are the keys?

50:18.021 --> 50:19.773
- With my jacket.
- Which is where?

50:19.982 --> 50:24.032
Back in the teachers' lounge
which is impossible to get to.

50:32.077 --> 50:33.499
Where does that lead?

50:34.872 --> 50:36.465
Conditioning of air.

50:36.665 --> 50:39.509
So this duct takes us
to the teacher's lounge?

50:39.710 --> 50:41.428
We take the duct to the lounge.

50:41.628 --> 50:44.882
We get something from the vending
machine and grab Wade's keys.

50:45.090 --> 50:48.720
We get back here, fix Calvin up
and take the duct to the parking lot.

50:48.927 --> 50:51.726
If we're near the office
we should grab our phones too.

50:51.930 --> 50:56.060
But who's going up into that thing?
Who's teensy, weensy enough to fit...?

50:59.730 --> 51:01.858
Me? No, no, no.

51:02.065 --> 51:04.864
No, I... No, I definitely don't
do brave stuff.

51:05.068 --> 51:07.617
I've never even been camping.
I have a blog.

51:07.821 --> 51:12.577
I get excited about Apple products.
That's what I'm comfortable with.

51:15.871 --> 51:17.373
Here we go.

51:24.046 --> 51:28.472
By letting you guard this,
I'm trusting you with my entire life.

51:32.221 --> 51:37.728
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

51:40.103 --> 51:43.573
- It'll protect you.
- Thanks, Tamra.

52:09.466 --> 52:14.472
<i>Remember,
Clint. If you fail, we're all gonna die.</i>

52:16.139 --> 52:18.813
<i>I appreciate the update.</i>

52:20.561 --> 52:24.941
- You're doing great. Just trust yourself.
- Yeah, and your cock is girthy too.

52:25.148 --> 52:26.775
- <i>Fuck off, Wade.</i>
- You fuck off.

52:26.984 --> 52:28.577
Both of you out it out.

52:28.777 --> 52:31.826
You know who you sound like?
You sound like your students.

52:32.030 --> 52:34.874
<i>I don't have students.
I'm not a teacher. I'm a writer.</i>

52:35.075 --> 52:37.919
Yeah, self-published, writer.
I'm self-published too.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.997
Doug, you wanna buy my book?

52:41.957 --> 52:43.550
There are no words on this.

52:43.750 --> 52:47.254
- You know what? I'm going to...
- Lucy, what are you doing?

52:48.046 --> 52:51.721
- No. No, you are not...
- You can't do anything to stop me!

52:51.925 --> 52:55.429
If I wanna go in the fucking
air-conditioning duct, I'll go.

52:55.637 --> 52:58.811
I'm just gonna die anyway
just like the rest of you assholes.

52:59.016 --> 53:01.485
So maybe I'm gonna try
and do something brave.

53:01.685 --> 53:06.907
A final pointless gesture of kindness
in this cruel shitty world

53:07.107 --> 53:12.329
that likes taking gestures of kindness
and shitting and peeing on them.

53:12.529 --> 53:15.908
You know what else? Since you're
all gonna be dead soon anyway,

53:16.116 --> 53:17.459
I should tell you

53:18.285 --> 53:21.129
I hate every single one of you.

53:36.386 --> 53:40.482
It's me. It's me! I'm coming with you
whether you like it or not, so shut up.

53:40.682 --> 53:42.025
OK.

53:42.559 --> 53:44.857
This makes me so nervous.

53:45.771 --> 53:48.866
He paces like this late at night
when he's on the phone too.

53:49.066 --> 53:50.568
It's just ridiculous.

53:50.776 --> 53:52.198
How do you know that?

53:54.112 --> 53:56.365
You'd better not let anything
happen to her.

53:56.573 --> 54:00.419
That's funny. I was thinking of letting
really bad things happen to her.

54:00.619 --> 54:03.213
I will squeeze up in there
and slap your dick off.

54:05.874 --> 54:09.469
- Thanks for coming to help me.
- No problem.

55:48.727 --> 55:50.821
I think this is it.

56:08.038 --> 56:09.585
Careful.

56:23.011 --> 56:27.266
- Oh. Um, do you have a dollar?
- Yeah.

56:33.688 --> 56:35.281
There's Wade's keys.

56:37.734 --> 56:40.078
I'm gonna go check and see
if there's a phone.

56:40.278 --> 56:42.531
- No, wait for me.
- No, we don't have time.

56:42.739 --> 56:45.083
You get the candy bar.
I'm gonna get a phone.

56:45.283 --> 56:46.785
OK, be careful.

56:51.331 --> 56:52.708
Come on.

56:56.962 --> 56:59.010
Come on.

57:44.301 --> 57:45.974
Shit.

58:22.339 --> 58:25.593
- Clint, get in! Get in!
- I'm working on it. Come on.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.598
Hurry up!

58:43.985 --> 58:46.989
We're not gonna make it.
Go left.

58:47.906 --> 58:49.249
Guys, head's up.

58:51.743 --> 58:53.120
They did it.

58:53.328 --> 58:55.456
Hey, look what we got for you.

59:05.131 --> 59:06.474
Put it back, put it back.

59:08.885 --> 59:10.432
The desk! The desk!

59:11.513 --> 59:14.266
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

59:25.276 --> 59:26.573
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

59:26.778 --> 59:29.531
- Miss Stanford.
- Jesus.

59:31.157 --> 59:32.955
After the fifth half-eaten corpse
you see,

59:33.159 --> 59:36.584
it's still horrifying,
but somehow slightly less horrifying.

59:41.167 --> 59:42.510
Shit.

59:44.295 --> 59:47.344
Look out. They're in the vents.
They're heading your way.

59:50.260 --> 59:51.728
- I'll get the locks.
- OK.

59:51.928 --> 59:54.022
- More stuff. Come on.
- Here.

59:54.222 --> 59:55.895
- Here.
- Let's go. Come on.

59:56.683 --> 59:58.902
- Keep it coming.
- Here.

01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:03.527
Straps.

01:00:10.321 --> 01:00:11.789
Come on.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.492
Got it.

01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:21.507
Why do they pound?
What does the pounding accomplish?

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.802
<i>Are you guys OK?</i>

01:00:24.002 --> 01:00:26.346
Yeah, we're all good.
Thanks for the heads-up.

01:00:26.546 --> 01:00:29.390
We're not all good.
We are trapped in here.

01:00:29.591 --> 01:00:31.764
Oh, God, those kids
are gonna come in here.

01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:34.346
- They're gonna rip us to shreds.
- We get it.

01:00:34.554 --> 01:00:37.649
You've got to calm down right now.

01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:40.856
- I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Calm.

01:00:41.352 --> 01:00:42.444
I'm fine.

01:00:43.897 --> 01:00:47.026
- I'm calm.
- OK. Thank you.

01:00:47.692 --> 01:00:49.444
Calm down.

01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:51.366
I'm calm!

01:00:51.571 --> 01:00:53.619
I already said I was calm!

01:00:55.241 --> 01:00:59.496
This is like the worst Monday ever.

01:01:27.982 --> 01:01:30.826
This probably isn't
the greatest timing,

01:01:31.027 --> 01:01:33.621
but I have a confession to make.

01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:39.370
When I saw you this morning,
I was only pretending to be surprised.

01:01:39.577 --> 01:01:41.579
I knew you taught here.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:46.593
Really?

01:01:48.169 --> 01:01:53.141
Yeah, I've been pretty depressed lately
and I just wanted to see you.

01:01:54.384 --> 01:01:57.888
It's stupid. We haven't had
a conversation in like 15 years.

01:01:58.096 --> 01:02:01.316
I guess I kind of missed you somehow.

01:02:02.642 --> 01:02:06.818
- Sorry, that's so creepy.
- No, it's not creepy.

01:02:07.021 --> 01:02:08.648
I'm just surprised.

01:02:08.857 --> 01:02:13.363
I heard you were in New York
following your dream being a writer.

01:02:16.698 --> 01:02:20.373
I have another confession to make.

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:25.124
Remember when I said
I wasn't a teacher?

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.792
That was a lie too.

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:29.441
That's what I was doing in New York.

01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:33.760
Really?

01:02:34.507 --> 01:02:40.139
Yeah. Yeah, I've been teaching
first grade for two years.

01:02:43.183 --> 01:02:48.030
I mean, I thought I would have free time
to write, um, on my free time,

01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:51.199
but as it turns out
there is no free time.

01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:53.743
Teaching is the hardest job
in the world.

01:02:54.235 --> 01:02:55.737
And I would...

01:02:56.654 --> 01:02:58.622
...look out at the kids in my class

01:02:58.823 --> 01:03:02.373
and I found myself
getting jealous of them.

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:06.714
They have the whole world
ahead of them.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:08.542
Their whole lives ahead of them.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.254
They have all these opportunities
that have already passed me by.

01:03:15.423 --> 01:03:16.845
What?

01:03:18.176 --> 01:03:22.147
Nothing. I was gonna tell you, you were
wrong, but you sort of have a point.

01:03:22.347 --> 01:03:25.521
Oh, that's super comforting. Thanks.

01:03:42.742 --> 01:03:43.994
Oh.

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:50.709
- I probably shouldn't have done that.
- I know. I know.

01:03:50.917 --> 01:03:53.215
I can't just barge into your life
like that.

01:03:53.419 --> 01:03:55.262
Even if I do kind of
hate your boyfriend.

01:03:58.258 --> 01:03:59.931
Just need a bottle of wine.

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:03.138
Right? One of those backpacks
must have some beer in it.

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:06.316
Definitely Ritalin.
Probably Adderall too.

01:04:09.936 --> 01:04:11.654
Wait.

01:04:15.817 --> 01:04:17.740
There's still so much I haven't done.

01:04:17.944 --> 01:04:23.747
Like... Like I've also wanted
to fire an Uzi. I don't know.

01:04:24.909 --> 01:04:27.003
I wanted a bunny.

01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:30.673
I always wanted a bunny growing up
and never got one.

01:04:30.873 --> 01:04:32.875
You know what I want?

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:37.339
I wanna know why my brother-in-law
makes ten times what I do.

01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:39.675
You know what he does for a living?

01:04:39.882 --> 01:04:43.011
He makes giant foam fingers
for football games.

01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:46.974
You tell people you're a teacher
and they look at you like

01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:49.400
you must've wanted
to do something else.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.571
It's like, "Fuck you, man.
I'm raising your kids."

01:04:54.022 --> 01:04:55.695
I love my job.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.818
- And teachers deserve respect.
- Yeah.

01:04:59.652 --> 01:05:03.828
I'm sorry that it took me until today
to realise this,

01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:08.253
but I really actually like you guys.

01:05:13.374 --> 01:05:16.878
I always wanted to have sex
with a prostitute who was non-white.

01:05:20.256 --> 01:05:21.678
Is anybody there?

01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:23.976
Wade?

01:05:24.344 --> 01:05:27.689
- <i>Hey. You OK?</i>
- Yeah.

01:05:28.598 --> 01:05:31.442
<i>Hey. Listen, Lucy, about today...</i>

01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:33.770
Wade, we can talk about this
another time.

01:05:33.978 --> 01:05:37.403
- Let's not talk about this now.
- <i>No, I wanna talk about it.</i>

01:05:37.607 --> 01:05:42.204
<i>Lucy, I love you and I'm so sorry
that I was an asshole today.</i>

01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:45.657
Clint's not listening, is he?

01:05:47.742 --> 01:05:49.619
- No, it's just me.
<i>- Good.</i>

01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:53.752
<i>Because... Look, I know you're
not crazy about your hometown.</i>

01:05:53.956 --> 01:05:56.630
And this is not what you pictured
growing up

01:05:56.834 --> 01:05:58.882
that you'd be dating
some PE teacher.

01:06:00.088 --> 01:06:03.638
<i>I guess I just got jealous that
some fancy-pants New York writer</i>

01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:06.310
- <i>was gonna swoop in...</i>
- No, wait.

01:06:06.511 --> 01:06:08.639
<i>I know you've always wanted
to live there.</i>

01:06:08.846 --> 01:06:11.895
<i>- I don't know that that's something...</i>
- Wade, it's Clint.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.604
<i>- Damn it, put Lucy back on.</i>
- I'm not a fancy writer from New York.

01:06:15.812 --> 01:06:18.611
I'm a bad writer from Fort Chicken.
I live with my mum.

01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:20.567
I sleep in a bed I used to pee in.

01:06:20.775 --> 01:06:22.743
You're a handsome guy
who Lucy likes,

01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:26.448
and if you guys are meant
to be together I'm all for it.

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:28.704
I'm sorry I got in the way.

01:06:34.497 --> 01:06:36.420
You really think I'm a handsome guy?

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:40.757
<i>Listen. Thanks, Clint.</i>

01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:42.305
Just...

01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:46.138
Can you put Lucy back on, please?

01:06:48.428 --> 01:06:50.430
<i>Wade, I love you, but I...</i>

01:06:50.638 --> 01:06:52.390
- <i>Wade, it's me again.</i>
- Goddamnit!

01:06:52.598 --> 01:06:54.100
I have an idea. Listen up.

01:07:01.774 --> 01:07:04.027
Oh, dear lord.

01:07:04.235 --> 01:07:06.158
Is the coast clear?

01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:09.870
If by clear you mean
full of terrifying imagery

01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:12.827
that will take me years of therapy
to unsee.

01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:14.378
Hey.

01:07:14.579 --> 01:07:16.547
Hey, sweetie.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.631
OK, go for it.

01:07:21.586 --> 01:07:25.807
Look, drugs. You hungry for drugs?
Want some Ritalin? Some Adderall?

01:07:29.135 --> 01:07:31.433
Do you remember how
in that movie <i>Commando,</i>

01:07:31.637 --> 01:07:36.939
and every other eighties action film
there was that suiting-up montage?

01:07:37.143 --> 01:07:39.566
- Well, this is that scene.
- Yeah.

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:44.116
Now, they've got us outnumbered,
outgunned and out...

01:07:44.775 --> 01:07:48.655
...numbered, but there's one thing
we have that they don't.

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:51.036
The drive to win.

01:07:52.158 --> 01:07:54.331
They seem very driven to me.

01:07:54.535 --> 01:07:57.379
We need to turn this room inside out.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.550
Look under every shelf,
inside every box,

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:03.841
gather anything you
or someone else could use.

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:08.095
We've got to collect everything.
We've gotta have bats and tools

01:08:08.299 --> 01:08:09.926
and ropes and pointy things.

01:08:10.134 --> 01:08:14.014
Anything that has a spike on it,
anything that's serrated.

01:08:14.222 --> 01:08:17.725
We're not playing defence anymore.
Darn fourth graders.

01:08:17.934 --> 01:08:20.028
You can forget about them.
They're gone.

01:08:20.228 --> 01:08:23.448
Forget who you think
you're fighting. We're going to war.

01:08:23.648 --> 01:08:26.151
I used to be a champion.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:30.113
I'm a little fatter now,
I'm a little balder too,

01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:32.573
but I've still got that spirit.

01:08:33.032 --> 01:08:35.911
And they are not taking
that away from me.

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:37.495
Ever.

01:08:38.787 --> 01:08:42.167
I've played dodgeball a million times
with these little shits.

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:45.254
Go for the face. It's their weak spot.

01:08:47.796 --> 01:08:51.176
Huh. I guess they really can
overdose on that stuff.

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:54.830
<i>OK,
looks like the Adderall did the job.</i>

01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:56.810
<i>They should be knocked out
for a while.</i>

01:08:57.014 --> 01:08:59.233
When we say go,
rendezvous in the main hall,

01:08:59.433 --> 01:09:04.234
<i>head straight for the back door, then
haul ass to Wade's truck. Ready?</i>

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:06.691
We are good to go. We can do this.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:11.621
Between us we've got
18 regional-championship trophies,

01:09:11.821 --> 01:09:15.951
three MVPs,
and one state-championship ring.

01:09:16.158 --> 01:09:17.785
<i>Wade, those are all your awards.</i>

01:09:17.993 --> 01:09:20.122
Exactly, and I'm a part of this team.

01:09:20.328 --> 01:09:22.957
That makes us all champions.

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:24.712
Now, are we ready?

01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:26.214
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:09:26.419 --> 01:09:28.136
- I'm gay.
- I fucking knew it.

01:09:28.337 --> 01:09:30.010
Hitachi, you ready?

01:09:32.008 --> 01:09:33.760
Yes, Hitachi ready to die.

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:37.848
My father told me story once.
Story of frog and caterpillar.

01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:43.107
Story goes, it was winter and frog
is sitting on snow-covered branch.

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.439
The frog saw the caterpillar
and asked...

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:48.694
OK, this story is taking way too long.
Let's play some dodgeball.

01:09:58.117 --> 01:09:59.960
Hey, guys.

01:10:22.767 --> 01:10:25.566
OK, I got this.

01:10:28.356 --> 01:10:30.108
Come on.

01:11:15.194 --> 01:11:16.662
Fuck, yeah. Let's go.

01:11:17.655 --> 01:11:19.828
Go, go. Move it.

01:11:20.032 --> 01:11:22.126
- Let's go.
- OK. Go, go, go.

01:11:25.162 --> 01:11:27.540
Damn it, I'm out of balls.

01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:37.141
Oh, shit.

01:11:58.154 --> 01:11:59.406
Fuck.

01:12:03.784 --> 01:12:05.411
Rock 'n' roll!

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.683
Get back.

01:12:20.634 --> 01:12:23.057
- Lucy? Where's Lucy?
- I don't know.

01:12:32.104 --> 01:12:33.447
Come on. Come on.

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:53.672
You motherfuckers!

01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:06.643
- Thanks.
- Take me to Subway some time.

01:13:07.723 --> 01:13:09.316
- Lucy.
- OK. OK.

01:13:09.517 --> 01:13:11.770
Get behind me. Get back.

01:13:12.937 --> 01:13:14.484
Get back. Get back.

01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:19.285
Give me the keys.

01:13:23.739 --> 01:13:26.788
- Get those kids to the truck.
- Go, go, go.

01:13:28.452 --> 01:13:30.375
Get off him!

01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:33.673
Come on, let's go.

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:39.047
He's behind us.

01:13:42.383 --> 01:13:44.306
Get in. Get in.

01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:50.308
Hey, Danielle Steel.

01:13:54.603 --> 01:13:55.946
Take care of her.

01:13:57.690 --> 01:13:59.067
No!

01:14:01.318 --> 01:14:03.286
- No, no, no, Lucy. No.
- No. Wade.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.584
- No, no, no. Hang on, Lucy. Lucy, no.
- Wade! No! No!

01:14:22.965 --> 01:14:24.308
No!

01:14:31.974 --> 01:14:34.318
No, we gotta go. We gotta go. Go.

01:14:34.518 --> 01:14:36.816
- Get in.
- Oh, my God.

01:14:37.021 --> 01:14:38.398
Oh, God.

01:14:39.064 --> 01:14:40.782
Wade?

01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:46.204
No!

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:07.264
Lucy, I'm sorry.

01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:17.649
What about these kids' parents?

01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:25.153
What about our parents?

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.837
Shit.

01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:41.715
- What?
- What?

01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:43.508
We're almost empty.

01:15:48.968 --> 01:15:50.515
Everybody hold on!

01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:03.774
Must have been in the back
the whole time.

01:16:04.066 --> 01:16:05.506
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:10.035
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:14.368
Ram him!

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:21.630
Eat a cock.

01:16:33.012 --> 01:16:34.480
Well, that ought to do it.

01:16:45.816 --> 01:16:48.365
Guys, up ahead. It's Danville.

01:16:48.569 --> 01:16:51.448
At least it's not Fort Chicken.

01:17:05.753 --> 01:17:07.426
Oh, no.

01:17:12.593 --> 01:17:14.345
Jesus.

01:17:16.055 --> 01:17:17.398
They got out.

01:17:18.557 --> 01:17:20.275
Well, I'd feel worse

01:17:20.476 --> 01:17:24.322
if all these dead people
weren't from fucking Danville.

01:17:30.444 --> 01:17:34.699
Well, now we're really out of gas.

01:17:41.663 --> 01:17:43.006
Everybody stay close.

01:17:54.426 --> 01:17:57.225
- Wait. Where's Doug?
- There he is.

01:17:58.263 --> 01:18:02.268
- Doug, come on.
- No, you come here.

01:18:09.691 --> 01:18:10.988
They're everywhere.

01:18:17.407 --> 01:18:19.000
That's Indiana.

01:18:19.535 --> 01:18:21.833
That's Ohio.

01:18:22.037 --> 01:18:23.755
It's an epidemic.

01:18:23.956 --> 01:18:25.924
Actually the correct term
is pandemic.

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:28.594
A pandemic covers
a much wider geographical...

01:18:28.794 --> 01:18:30.717
That's the Fort Chicken factory.

01:18:34.216 --> 01:18:37.891
Is there anything from that factory
served in the school cafeteria?

01:18:38.095 --> 01:18:39.472
Chicken nuggets.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.478
Of course. A food-borne virus.

01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:45.812
If I could get homing endonucleases,
each one targeting a different specific...

01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:48.317
You're doing it again.
You're doing it again.

01:18:48.522 --> 01:18:50.445
Rebekka, quiet please.

01:18:50.649 --> 01:18:53.027
OK, see, that time
I was actually talking.

01:18:53.235 --> 01:18:56.910
If we could isolate the virus
and kill it while preserving the capsid...

01:18:57.114 --> 01:19:00.709
- Please dumb it down.
- If I could find one of the nuggets,

01:19:00.909 --> 01:19:03.332
maybe I could make a vaccine
for the virus.

01:19:12.337 --> 01:19:14.465
Everybody look for an open door.

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:20.099
- Guys, hurry up. Get in here.
- Go, go, go.

01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:29.563
Everyone OK?

01:19:30.856 --> 01:19:32.733
OK, we're here. We made it.

01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:35.114
Oh, I fucking hate Danville so much.

01:19:35.319 --> 01:19:36.821
Everyone stick together.

01:19:40.532 --> 01:19:43.911
I can't... I can't see anything.

01:19:44.786 --> 01:19:46.288
Someone find a li...

01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:50.171
- It's me.
- Jesus.

01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:52.844
These things are great.

01:19:53.253 --> 01:19:55.426
Let's go this way.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.724
Oh, my God.
Those are the nuggets.

01:20:03.931 --> 01:20:05.683
You'll come in handy, little one.

01:20:07.517 --> 01:20:12.148
Nugget out of here.
Nugget out... Nugget out of here.

01:20:13.815 --> 01:20:16.364
OK. Come on.

01:20:38.799 --> 01:20:40.221
Come on.

01:20:46.932 --> 01:20:48.775
Where are we?

01:21:12.332 --> 01:21:14.209
- I hate to say it, guys.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:14.418 --> 01:21:15.761
Oh, shit.

01:21:42.988 --> 01:21:44.786
Somebody order a bad-ass?

01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:46.958
Wade!

01:21:49.328 --> 01:21:50.454
Now, Hitachi.

01:21:50.662 --> 01:21:53.256
Now the time for the frog
to fuck the caterpillar?

01:21:53.457 --> 01:21:54.709
Whatever, Hitachi.

01:21:58.754 --> 01:22:01.473
- They're coming.
- Let's go!

01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:05.143
Get in the van!
Let's go. Move, move, move!

01:22:05.677 --> 01:22:07.520
I thought you were dead.

01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:10.440
It was just half time, baby.

01:22:10.932 --> 01:22:14.482
Go to the van! Run! Run! Run!

01:22:35.832 --> 01:22:38.551
Hurry! Let's go. We can make it.

01:22:39.753 --> 01:22:41.630
Help me wedge this in here.

01:22:44.091 --> 01:22:45.934
Clint, go. Get out of here.

01:22:49.888 --> 01:22:53.062
- Kids, kids, go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.

01:22:55.936 --> 01:22:58.860
Is this one of those
really intense drug interventions?

01:23:00.273 --> 01:23:03.447
I'm giving you kids an F for fuck you!

01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:15.171
Go, go, go!

01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:18.925
What are you doing?
Water won't hold them off.

01:23:19.126 --> 01:23:20.628
It ain't water.

01:23:30.929 --> 01:23:33.603
Nap time, motherfuckers.

01:23:46.486 --> 01:23:48.363
Let's roll.

01:23:52.701 --> 01:23:56.672
- Where are we going?
- Place kids don't wanna go.

01:23:56.872 --> 01:23:58.715
Wade, how did you find us?

01:23:58.915 --> 01:24:02.089
I always know where to find
my dual re... Real...

01:24:02.294 --> 01:24:06.845
My dual re... Dual real...
My dual real whe...

01:24:11.344 --> 01:24:14.348
Ripped by <font color="#80ffff">GoldenBeard</font>

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:59.661
<i>And the frog fucked the caterpillar. Ha.</i>
