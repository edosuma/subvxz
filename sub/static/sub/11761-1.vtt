00:12.920 --> 00:16.708
(Servant) King Uther, there is a visitor.
She won't give her name.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.719
Who are you?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.389
Morgan.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.078
Father.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.550
Your whore still lives.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.393
- You will respect your mother.
- Stepmother.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.470
- Why are you here?
- I've come home.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.192
I want to offer you forgiveness.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.869
For what?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.878
For the death of my mother,
so you could install this whore.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.114
(Grunts)

01:06.000 --> 01:08.150
And for banishing me
so I'd be silenced.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.953
- I sent you away for an education.
- 15 years in a nunnery,

01:11.080 --> 01:14.152
I learned more than you can imagine.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.317
Father, I'm your only child.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.278
Why wouldn't you welcome me home?

01:23.560 --> 01:25.551
You have lived too long
without my guidance.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.272
This isn't your home.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.992
And I no longer have a daughter.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.719
Don't turn your back on me, Father.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.512
You're not welcome, Morgan.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.675
Goodbye.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.192
Igraine, leave her.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.432
(Drumming)

03:29.360 --> 03:31.396
Uther? Uther!

03:31.520 --> 03:34.114
- (Choking)
- Uther!

03:35.320 --> 03:36.958
(Igraine) What's wrong?

03:37.080 --> 03:39.196
Help! Somebody help him!

03:40.320 --> 03:41.150
Uther!

03:43.400 --> 03:44.674
Help us!

03:49.120 --> 03:50.235
Out of my way!

03:50.360 --> 03:52.032
Open the gates!

04:05.560 --> 04:07.391
Help him! Help him!

04:07.520 --> 04:09.511
(Merlin) Take the King
to his chambers. Now.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.958
(Prayers in Latin)

04:18.920 --> 04:21.639
Whatever powers you have,
use them now.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.669
Uther.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.950
You're going to die.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.719
The poison was too strong.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.150
Put your hand to this.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.518
For Britain and the boy.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.758
(Thunderclap)

05:03.080 --> 05:04.069
(Groans)

05:04.200 --> 05:06.668
(Rumble of thunder)

05:15.400 --> 05:17.868
His time is done.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.589
Merlin!

05:24.600 --> 05:27.068
(Gasps)

05:31.200 --> 05:32.599
(Groans)

05:40.360 --> 05:41.713
(Thunderclap)

07:26.760 --> 07:29.513
In principio... (Kiss)

07:29.640 --> 07:31.471
...erat... (Kiss)

07:31.600 --> 07:32.999
...verbum.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.638
In the beginning was the word.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.399
And the word was...

07:38.520 --> 07:39.509
God, yes!

07:41.200 --> 07:42.599
This isn't Latin study.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.110
No, but it is definitely worship.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.437
- Arthur!
- (Both gasp)

07:50.560 --> 07:51.709
It can't be!

07:56.720 --> 07:58.153
Hey!

07:58.280 --> 08:00.475
- You bastard!
- Kay, listen.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.431
- She said you two were over.
- Arthur!

08:02.560 --> 08:04.391
- No, I did not.
- Oh, thanks a lot!

08:07.400 --> 08:08.310
Stop!

08:09.520 --> 08:11.875
Stop it, both of you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.797
(Groans)

08:17.720 --> 08:19.790
I should kill you.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.478
How did you even find us?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.830
I know where you bring your girls.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.552
And now mine, too.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.275
Get dressed.
I was sent to find you.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.879
There's a visitor.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.910
What's that got to do with me?

08:47.120 --> 08:49.680
It's bad, I know. I shouldn't have.
I wasn't thinking.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.598
You were thinking, "lf I get caught,
I can talk my way out of this."

08:52.720 --> 08:55.393
It was a mistake.
We got carried away.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.636
- Twice!
- Shut up.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.149
- Please, just shut up.
- Sometimes these things happen.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.555
She's Cleopatra,
you're Caesar and I'm Mark Antony.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.591
No, you're really not at all.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.756
We can't let a woman
come between us, Brother.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.677
Everything comes easy for you.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.437
You don't even appreciate it.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.509
What's going on?

09:21.920 --> 09:22.909
Mother?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.309
Father?

09:30.000 --> 09:30.989
He's here.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.799
(Merlin chuckles)

09:42.000 --> 09:45.390
- So you're the boy.
- I'm Arthur. Who are you?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.193
His name is Merlin
and he is not welcome here.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.515
- Then he'll be on his way.
- Put down your sword.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.108
- Do as you're told, boy!
- What is happening here?

09:56.520 --> 09:58.954
The King is dead, murdered.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.709
- So?
- Uther died with no legitimate son.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.116
What's that got to do with us?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.959
Not them. You...

10:11.080 --> 10:13.196
...are Uther's son.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.878
No.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.832
My parents are standing here.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.877
Tell him.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.752
Tell him.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.596
He's telling the truth, Arthur.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.831
He can't be. How can he be?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.909
Merlin brought you to us

10:43.040 --> 10:44.917
when you were less than a week old.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.876
We swore to look after you.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.319
What?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.158
The King is dead.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.118
Long live the King.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.032
- Take your lies and get out!
- Arthur.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.355
Arthur, give me the blade.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.595
Give me the blade.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.149
Now...

11:11.600 --> 11:14.797
You tell him how this happened.
You tell him the story of his birth.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.876
The details aren't important.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.194
They are to him!

11:20.320 --> 11:22.595
Arthur, I should have told you before.
I'm...

11:25.160 --> 11:26.832
I'm so sorry, son.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.759
Rest tonight.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.955
Tomorrow, we leave.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.509
(Morgan) Where is she?

11:37.640 --> 11:41.155
Lady lgraine remains
in mourning in her chamber.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.430
- And the men?
- Most are gone.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.710
- On whose authority?
- Merlin's.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.956
The night after your father's death,

11:48.080 --> 11:49.911
his warriors packed up and left.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.959
Then we'll find our own.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.957
Better and stronger.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.069
We?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.997
You answer to me now.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.559
Thank you.

12:42.200 --> 12:42.950
(Door opens)

12:45.160 --> 12:47.390
Pull down those banners.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.317
Confiscate all the weapons.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.273
And someone find the kitchens.
I'm bloody starving.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.675
The doors are open to you, my Lord.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.791
There's no need for force.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.478
Are you the one who summoned me?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.830
I'm Uther's daughter and sole heir.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.474
- Morgan Pendragon.
- Even as we speak,

13:03.600 --> 13:06.751
my men are slaughtering
all those still loyal to Uther.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.996
Why would you call me here?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.680
- To offer an alliance.
- Who with?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.836
- Me.
- (Guffaws)

13:16.040 --> 13:17.189
You?

13:17.320 --> 13:20.039
Who better than you, King Lot,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.390
my father's strongest opponent.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.438
I am immune to flattery.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.073
And yet you came when asked.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.953
- You've nothing to offer me.
- I hold this castle.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.637
I could split you from your gut
to your throat

13:35.760 --> 13:36.875
and still take it.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.233
But you're cleverer than that.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.032
- Am l?
- Kill me,

13:41.160 --> 13:43.515
and you're just a warlord
taking yet another castle.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.154
- But if we stand together...
- I stand alone.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.349
If we forge a union,

13:47.480 --> 13:50.631
we'd have the strength
to unite the realm.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.790
As King and Queen.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.948
There is already a queen
within these walls.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.436
I could take her
and still sit on Uther's throne.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.996
- She is to be exiled.
- Oh, is she now?

14:05.120 --> 14:07.076
Yes.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.760
You're very confident in your plans.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.518
I am.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.557
What makes you so special?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.439
Come near me and I'll kill you.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.992
Don't issue empty threats.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.599
Who are you?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.038
I knew Uther Pendragon.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.955
I was at his side when he died.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.359
The King's will,

14:56.480 --> 14:58.516
signed by his own hand,

14:58.640 --> 15:02.030
bearing his seal,
attesting to your birth.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.398
This was your father's.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.399
Take it.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.675
When you were born,
I took you

15:13.800 --> 15:15.199
and brought you here.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.317
You may be of king's blood
but Uther was a barbarian.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.590
Placing you here
made you so much more.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.032
I told Ector
how to raise and educate you.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.072
He swore to keep you safe.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.236
They raised you well.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.472
Perhaps too well.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.515
Why? Why do you need me?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.119
Everything in time.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.674
I sometimes wondered
why they doted more on you.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.995
You always got away with so much.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.509
- It was never like that.
- It's always been like that.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.835
You've just never seen it.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.077
You're used to the world falling
at your feet the moment you smile.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.838
But it's all right.
This makes sense of it.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.951
They treated you like you were special.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.277
- Because you are.
- At last you finally admit it.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.712
Hey, this doesn't change anything.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.469
You're still my brother.
And you're still infuriating.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.869
What do I do?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.833
I can't just leave. This is my home.
This is what I know, here.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.996
But what you're being offered is better.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.792
Going to battle, leading the land.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.913
- It's what every man dreams of.
- No, it's what you dream of.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.315
The rest of us dream about girls.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.432
You think a leader won't get
his choice of girls?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.039
Why shouldn't it be your destiny?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.238
If it was me,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.555
I'd go,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.432
in an instant.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.959
So, you're coming.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.118
I'm not saying I believe you.
It's just I want to see it for myself.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.239
You're ready.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.439
Why didn't you tell me?

18:07.560 --> 18:10.074
I was afraid of losing you.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.792
Because you are my son.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.911
You'll always be my mother.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.872
I place him in your care.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.956
- You keep him safe.
- You have my word.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.913
It's what you were born for.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.429
It's what we've guided you for.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.154
You remember what I taught you.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.669
When you make decisions,
you use...this

18:37.800 --> 18:39.916
in conjunction with this.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.635
- And you never use that!
- I'll try and remember that.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.999
No son ever had a better father.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.197
- I want you to know...
- I know, I know, I know.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.717
I love you.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.710
You've given me everything
my entire life

19:03.840 --> 19:07.071
and I feel guilty
for asking for anything more, but...

19:08.560 --> 19:11.233
I need Kay.
I want him with me.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.793
Yes.

19:12.920 --> 19:13.909
Yes!

19:14.040 --> 19:15.996
Whatever this is,
I can't do it without you.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.509
He thought you'd never ask.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.279
Together, you're stronger.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.549
It's time.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.719
Yes!

19:54.320 --> 19:55.799
- Say my name.
- Morgan.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.395
- Who will I be?
- Queen of the realm.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.714
Are you fit to be my king?

20:00.840 --> 20:02.876
Oh, you know I am.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.917
What will you give me?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.917
Undying loyalty.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.952
- Swear your fealty.
- Swear yours to me.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.593
- Swear it!
- I swear.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.312
On what?

20:14.440 --> 20:15.919
- On my oath.
- Yes!

20:16.040 --> 20:18.349
- My life.
- Yes!

20:18.480 --> 20:21.552
- And your blood.
- My blood!

20:29.680 --> 20:32.148
Where did you learn that, huh?

20:34.920 --> 20:36.876
Your father dies,

20:37.760 --> 20:40.399
and you banish your own mother
from her home.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.397
- lmpressive.
- Stepmother.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.356
I'm the only one of Uther's blood.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.550
His castle and realm should be mine.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.315
So you summon me,

20:51.440 --> 20:53.237
Uther's worst enemy.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.475
You propose an alliance

20:56.600 --> 20:59.068
and then seduce me,

20:59.200 --> 21:01.714
even as your father's body cools.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.238
Is there no end to your ambition?

21:06.360 --> 21:08.237
- Are you complaining?
- No.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.032
I'm just curious.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.191
- A queen still requires a king.
- Yes.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.993
Together, we'll unite the realm.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.109
Yes.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.629
(Guard shouts)

21:21.760 --> 21:23.716
I'll set her on the way myself.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.879
Yes.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.880
It suits you up there.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.399
Where will you go?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.909
Your father had plenty of allies
who will give me space.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.429
Was there anything else,
or did you just come to gloat?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.835
Just give thanks
you're leaving here alive.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.754
I did nothing to harm you.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.838
Indeed, my Lady, you did nothing

21:58.960 --> 22:02.509
when my mother was murdered
so that you could take her place

22:02.640 --> 22:04.790
and you did nothing
when my father banished me.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.115
No queen questions her king.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.913
And I thought my opinion of you
couldn't get any lower.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.956
(Horse whinnies)

22:14.080 --> 22:15.479
Safe travels!

22:19.240 --> 22:20.832
The land is treacherous.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.670
I bring a message from Merlin.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.233
(Morgan) What does he want?

22:26.360 --> 22:29.636
He asks that you attend Uther's son
at the ancient castle of Camelot.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.309
Uther's son?

22:32.440 --> 22:34.032
That's what I was told to deliver.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.159
He has a son.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.675
I have the only true claim to the throne.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.870
This is Merlin's game.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.150
So we'll play with him.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.672
(Lot chuckles)

23:17.560 --> 23:20.757
If you were responsible for my birth,
I deserve to know who you are.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.072
Stop asking about me
and think about who you are.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.838
Are you really a sorcerer?

23:30.400 --> 23:32.834
I can do things
others believe impossible.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.118
Is that sorcery?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.559
Well, go on then.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.636
Show me. Prove it to me.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.431
You pull me from one coast to the other
and you tell me nothing!

23:56.880 --> 23:58.632
You asked me why I need you.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.556
I had a vision of what was to come.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.359
What sort of vision?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.159
The darkness of man.
I won't let it happen again.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.396
And you had this vision
before I was conceived?

24:17.200 --> 24:18.599
The past doesn't matter.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.354
Define yourself in the present
and you might rule in the future.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.395
(Flies buzzing)

24:42.200 --> 24:43.792
(Kay) Dear God.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.560
- It's already begun.
- (Arthur) What?

24:49.680 --> 24:52.990
Without a king, there will be
carnage across the land.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.716
What are you doing?

24:58.840 --> 25:01.229
Whoever these men are,
they deserve a Christian burial.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.679
They're long past saving.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.596
Arthur, tell him.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.553
If we stay here,
we're a target for whoever did this.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.752
Stop worrying about the dead.
The living need us more.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.956
Merlin's right.
We need to keep moving.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.308
We can't help them now.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.359
Go!

25:21.480 --> 25:22.674
Let's move!

25:33.280 --> 25:35.430
(Merlin) We rest here.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.028
(Kay) This village? Is that wise?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.752
(Merlin) We'll find out.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.715
Fear spreads like plague.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.239
Stay on your horses
and ride on through.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.238
We are on our way to the coast.
We were hoping for shelter tonight.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.998
There's no welcome here.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.279
Not even for an old friend?

26:19.520 --> 26:21.431
Merlin, is that you?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.594
- That's more like it.
- It's been too long.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.993
It's people like these
that will be next to the slaughter

26:34.240 --> 26:36.071
if you don't fulfil your destiny.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.792
What would you have done
if I'd said no?

26:37.920 --> 26:40.434
A stranger says you're the future king.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.559
Maybe it takes a night,
maybe it takes a year,

26:44.680 --> 26:47.353
but in the end
you're too curious not to come.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.677
- You think you know me that well?
- I watched you since you were a child.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.519
Tell me about my birth.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.234
Your father, Uther,

27:03.640 --> 27:05.631
desired a woman named lgraine

27:06.720 --> 27:08.836
who belonged to a rival warlord,

27:08.960 --> 27:10.791
the Duke of Cornwall.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.309
Unable to best his forces,

27:15.680 --> 27:19.116
Uther...changed tactics.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.073
- And summoned me.
- To do what?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.716
To change Uther to resemble Cornwall

27:25.840 --> 27:28.070
so he could have lgraine
for just one night.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.310
Am I to believe
I'm the product of sorcery and rape?

27:37.440 --> 27:38.953
You were conceived that night.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.399
Merlin, I want the truth,

27:46.520 --> 27:49.034
not some story
to make me believe in magic.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.479
I don't care what you believe.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.239
But I've sworn off those powers
a long time ago.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.918
- Why?
- Because they cost.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.076
- Cost how?
- Do you want me to finish or not?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.192
So Uther gave me to you.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.118
You...were my payment.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.352
Why would you take a child
as payment?

28:14.480 --> 28:18.473
This realm needs a leader, better
than any who has come before.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.558
With Uther's bloodline
and Ector's guidance,

28:21.680 --> 28:23.113
that can be you.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.276
I know you've got questions,

28:26.240 --> 28:27.639
but I will be at your side

28:27.760 --> 28:30.320
and we will find
the answers together.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.470
We are going to build a land
full of hope and honour

28:35.600 --> 28:38.068
where fear is extinguished

28:38.200 --> 28:41.909
to which people will flock
from far and wide,

28:43.160 --> 28:46.550
seeking out our beacon of light.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.069
Tomorrow we ride

28:49.200 --> 28:51.668
to an ancient seat of power.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.870
You can be the greatest of men

28:55.680 --> 28:57.636
in the greatest of lands.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.070
Trust me, Arthur.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.791
(Sword being unsheathed)

29:33.160 --> 29:34.388
(Kay) Arthur!

29:41.760 --> 29:43.159
I'm coming!

30:00.160 --> 30:01.559
An outrider for King Lot.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.477
These are Lot's colours.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.955
You're not even installed
and you're starting a war.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.354
Back on the horses.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.671
If we're here when they find him,

30:10.800 --> 30:12.711
you won't live to be king.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.309
Camelot.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.475
Yah!

31:05.800 --> 31:07.518
(Creaking)

31:21.640 --> 31:24.916
- It's a ruin.
- The Romans built it.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.792
We'll create the future here.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.399
(Merlin) It has good position,

31:33.520 --> 31:35.750
strong fortifications,
and no one will expect it.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.599
I thought there'd be armies,
and weapons and servants.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.188
- And girls?
- There has to be more than this, right?

31:41.320 --> 31:42.833
- I mean, I must have money.
- No.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.270
- Why didn't you say so before we left?
- You wouldn't have come.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.834
- You didn't say it would be like this.
- You didn't ask.

31:48.960 --> 31:53.112
We're in a fight for our lives,
for the soul of this country.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.800
Now, there are people waiting.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.151
(Creaking)

32:06.400 --> 32:07.879
The Great Hall of Camelot.

32:21.320 --> 32:24.995
Meet those who have sworn
their allegiance to you.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.151
Ulfius.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.315
Leontes.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.475
Brastias.

32:34.600 --> 32:35.794
Pelinor.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.357
Your father was a great leader.
Our loyalty passes to you.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.278
We stand at your bidding,
ready to defend the Pendragon line.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.999
I never knew Uther.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.478
But if he inspired such loyalty,
I am humbled

32:59.600 --> 33:01.909
to stand before you.

33:02.040 --> 33:05.794
I'll do whatever I can
to justify your allegiance.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.193
We are your servants.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.993
These are your allies.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.917
Your enemies
are much greater in number.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.871
Something else
you forgot to mention.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.878
King Lot of Lothian and Orkney.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.195
The new Duke of Cornwall.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.913
Kings Nentes,
Scotland, and Carados.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.315
- I've summoned them here.
- You've done what?

33:30.440 --> 33:35.992
So they all can recognise you
as the true heir of Uther Pendragon.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.712
And what if they don't?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.717
They must.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.998
These are your chambers.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.318
I had your father's effects
brought here.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.832
What was he like,
my father?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.038
Unyielding.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.351
And that's it?

34:12.400 --> 34:14.516
The life of a man,
and you take one word.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.710
- That's all you need to know.
- No, it's not.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.478
I want to know everything.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.068
What he ate, what he drank.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.952
How he stood, who he loved.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.399
What made him laugh or weep.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.918
And you give me one word.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.952
Anyone else can tell you
his character and contradictions.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.116
I gave you the word you most require.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.708
The aspect you must take from him.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.074
An unyielding strength.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.838
Because from now on,

34:39.719 --> 34:41.630
everyone will challenge you

34:41.760 --> 34:43.351
on everything.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.396
You need to be certain.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.589
What if I'm not?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.072
(Thud)

34:49.199 --> 34:50.599
You have to be.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.437
- What if I'm wrong?
- You can't be.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.597
Oh, one more thing.
Uther also had a daughter.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.711
Your half-sister.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.468
He installs a child in a ruin
and expects the kingdom to kneel?

35:08.600 --> 35:11.034
I think the sorcerer's mind is addled.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.357
No, he's clever.
This was a power once.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.630
He believes he can awaken it.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.273
Are you all right?

35:20.040 --> 35:21.871
The games of men exhaust me.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.239
We ride in strong.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.999
If this pretender wears
my father's robes,

35:28.120 --> 35:29.519
I shall gouge his eyes.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.069
On!

35:34.760 --> 35:35.556
(Knocking)

35:51.280 --> 35:52.998
That's your sister?

36:16.560 --> 36:17.549
(Sniffs)

36:23.920 --> 36:24.909
No.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.112
He's Uther's son. I have proof.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.232
My father had no legitimate son.
I would have known.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.476
Honestly, this is as strange to me
as it is to you.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.431
- But when Merlin brought...
- It talks, too.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.513
It's pretty, it talks,

36:39.640 --> 36:41.039
but it is not an heir.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.196
We can work together
to honour our father.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.912
You didn't know my father.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.037
(Laughs) Look at it.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.594
Not even a convincing pretender.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.551
You're not made of kings, boy,

36:53.680 --> 36:55.113
but of common clay.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.879
How much did the sorcerer
promise you?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.519
He didn't promise me anything.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.199
Why are you doing this to me?

37:06.320 --> 37:08.880
This isn't personal.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.638
This is for the country.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.352
This is my birthright.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.469
Is it?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.473
We should ask his mother,
Queen lgraine.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.473
- You were childless.
- I never spoke of this.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.636
This is some other man's bastard.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.478
Not my father's.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.875
I would have known.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.429
And yet, you didn't.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.234
Is this the boy I took from you
when he was born?

37:55.920 --> 37:59.117
Yes, I believe he is.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.438
This is Uther's son.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.959
My son.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.673
Oh, fuck this.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.676
You think this is the end of it?

38:23.880 --> 38:25.472
Merlin told me he changed Uther's face

38:25.600 --> 38:27.795
to resemble your husband,
the Duke of Cornwall.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.839
That's not possible.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.951
No, it's not.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.599
But I believe it happened.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.359
There was a moment,
when I looked at him

38:39.560 --> 38:40.959
that I saw another.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.953
I saw Uther.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.872
I don't understand. How did you
then come to be Uther's wife?

38:56.080 --> 38:58.310
That night that Uther was with me,

38:58.440 --> 38:59.998
his forces killed the Duke.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.998
The vanquishing warlord
can claim the victim's wife.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.757
I was lucky to live.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.438
But you were pregnant with me.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.399
You gave me up.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.998
Merlin tore you from my arms.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.236
Didn't you ever think of me?

39:15.360 --> 39:17.157
You were my first thought
each morning.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.798
I studied every boy's face,

39:19.920 --> 39:21.319
hoping for you.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.591
I was forbidden to search for you.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.672
I'm so sorry.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.955
Arthur.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.119
Are you all right?

39:44.200 --> 39:45.189
Yes.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.152
What was she like?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.679
How was it?

39:51.120 --> 39:52.109
Fine.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.189
That's it?

39:57.800 --> 39:59.199
Come on, let's explore.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.477
Let's look up here. Come on.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.516
(Birds' flying away)

40:18.720 --> 40:20.756
Here, look at this.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.748
"Magnus Quintus

40:30.200 --> 40:32.031
"built this fort

40:32.160 --> 40:35.470
"in the sixth year of the reign
of the Emperor Valentinian ll.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.715
"He who has begun

40:39.840 --> 40:42.115
"has the work half done."

40:42.240 --> 40:43.992
He wouldn't say that
if he saw the place now.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.838
Think what it must
have been like then.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.520
(Leontes) Or what it can be again.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.359
- Have you been following us?
- Merlin's instructions.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.879
I'm to keep you safe.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.996
Keep me safe
or make sure I don't leave?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.718
- Bit of both.
- What if I make a run for it?

40:58.840 --> 40:59.989
(Leontes) Why would you?

41:00.120 --> 41:02.918
You've got everything here.
There's so much potential.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.315
- You sound like Merlin.
- I believe in what he's doing.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.634
Why he brought you here.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.356
You followed him blindly
when you hadn't met me.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.391
No, not blindly.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.511
Some of us feel
it's not enough just to fight.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.631
There has to be a cause
worth fighting for.

41:16.760 --> 41:20.309
Merlin's told us what's possible,
what can be built here

41:20.440 --> 41:22.715
with you...a new breed of king.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.159
How do I become that overnight?

41:27.720 --> 41:29.119
Trust your instincts.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.117
What if my instincts
aren't that of a king?

41:33.240 --> 41:36.118
What if they are
and you just don't know it yet?

42:49.160 --> 42:51.355
(Merlin) Who is she?

42:52.520 --> 42:54.112
Who is she?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.714
- Who is she?
- What are you doing?

42:57.840 --> 42:59.319
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.714
Arthur.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.193
You'd better see this.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.552
This is all for you.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.352
God help me.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.513
What do we do now?

43:30.280 --> 43:31.838
Show no fear.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.632
Speak boldly.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.273
Answer them as their king.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.756
Nothing to worry about, right?
I mean, you've had visions. It's fate.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.233
- It's guaranteed.
- No.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.113
If you die, the visions will change.
Fate can go begging.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.993
Destiny has to be won.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.911
(Clattering of shields)

44:02.840 --> 44:05.513
Move. Stand aside.
Make way for the King's son.

44:05.640 --> 44:08.552
(Jeering)

44:25.680 --> 44:27.193
(Silence)

44:45.280 --> 44:48.238
Nothing can ever be the same
after this moment, Arthur.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.630
Leave now and salvage your life.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.672
Stay, and you lose everything.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.797
You're outnumbered.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.638
Don't be a sorcerer's figurehead.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.234
Go home.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.074
Speak, you beardless bastard!

45:22.200 --> 45:24.031
(Laughter)

45:27.920 --> 45:32.311
You stand in my hall in my realm
and you will show me respect.

45:33.440 --> 45:36.079
I am the true and legitimate heir
to Uther's throne.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.158
You will pledge your allegiance to me
or suffer for it.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.271
Understand that, you bearded fool!

45:42.720 --> 45:44.233
I'm sorry.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.039
Bring him in.

45:59.960 --> 46:03.669
That's my son, my eldest son.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.756
And you killed him.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.715
There were two outriders
in the woods that day.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.319
The other one saw it all.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.637
Hm?

46:21.760 --> 46:23.193
He attacked me.

46:41.640 --> 46:42.709
(Screams)

46:42.840 --> 46:45.638
- No! You bastard!
- (Kay) Mother!

46:45.760 --> 46:47.318
- Ah!
- (Screams)

46:47.440 --> 46:48.793
No!

46:56.640 --> 46:58.870
This stops nothing.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.639
I'm no monster.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.352
Five dawns I'll give you.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.994
Five dawns for him to grieve

47:06.120 --> 47:07.792
and then be gone.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.435
But if you don't leave,
there will be more slaughter.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.233
(Arthur gasps)

47:16.400 --> 47:17.992
Stop him!

47:18.120 --> 47:20.270
Stop him!

47:20.400 --> 47:22.118
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!

47:23.560 --> 47:26.916
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Merlin.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.429
What have you done to me?

47:29.560 --> 47:31.357
What have you done to me?

47:32.305 --> 47:38.297
