WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.334
Evening.

00:01.460 --> 00:02.919
It's been slow the last few weeks.

00:03.629 --> 00:05.296
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:05.422 --> 00:09.133
You come up short again and you'll be
serving beer out of a tent.

00:09.259 --> 00:12.011
If Arthur finds out I'm a cop,
then I'm a dead cop.

00:12.137 --> 00:15.807
- Can I come back to the firehouse?
- Any time you want.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.935
Maybe there's a way to get her into
a minimum security facility.

00:19.061 --> 00:19.936
Let me make some calls.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.146
I have some friends
at the State's Attorney's Office.

00:22.272 --> 00:26.192
The official Randall McHolland
for Union President campaign poster.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.528
We're taking Sullivan down.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.197
- Why don't we clear the air, Shay.
- There's nothing to talk about.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.074
Well, there is if you're
still pissed at me.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.284
How'd you get mixed up
with these gossipy bitches?

00:37.371 --> 00:40.873
The state believes
that Firehouse 51 is worth saving.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.626
It's your leadership
that we're unhappy with.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.129
I'll do whatever it takes to save 51.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.798
- My resignation.
- I'm taking over 51.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.439
This thing's broke.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.941
Hey! That's not helping.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.068
Hey, what's going on?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.737
Someone doesn't know how to make coffee.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.699
Guys, does anybody have
any Advil on them?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.452
Man, you've got to have something better
than Munter's Brown Roast.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.996
- Yeah, we got Starbucks.
- Where?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.498
About two blocks down on
the north side of the street.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.796
I'm going running.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.475
Kelly?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.642
Yeah?

01:41.769 --> 01:44.187
I don't know if you remember. I'm Beth.
Benny's wife.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.939
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.859
I know Benny's been hanging out
with you.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.070
And he won't return my phone calls.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.782
The boys miss him.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.993
- They need to see their father.
- I'm a little confused.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.496
He told me he was going back
to Kenosha every weekend.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.040
He hasn't been home in months.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.046
Look, I'm sorry to
dump all this on you.

02:10.172 --> 02:13.841
No, it's... I'll... I'll talk to him.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.511
Thank you.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.984
Hey, Chief, it's Kelly.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.195
Listen, I've got to stop by OFI
and see my old man.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.030
I might be a few minutes late to shift.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.867
Anyway, I'll explain everything to you
when I get there. Uh...

02:39.993 --> 02:43.663
Sorry about this.
Have Clarke cover for me. Thanks.

03:06.270 --> 03:11.732
Right. So, I will need your signature
just here, and one more just here.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.656
I need to be assured
that this means 51 is safe.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.950
Yes, it does.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.330
Okay.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.755
You're doing the right thing, Chief.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.301
Now I figure it will take a few weeks
to put it all together.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.594
I understand.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.138
In the meantime, I would appreciate it
if you would help us

03:42.264 --> 03:44.390
make this transition
as efficient as possible.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.725
I will help any way I can.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.648
You're going to walk away
with a very nice pension.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.022
Whoa, whoa!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.456
Help!

05:07.182 --> 05:09.183
- Hey, bud. What's your name?
- Nathan.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.560
Nathan, I need you to close
your eyes and cover your face.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.104
Can you do that for me?

05:18.527 --> 05:21.195
You can open your eyes now, Nathan.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.616
- Can you wiggle your toes?
- I think so. Yeah.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.744
- Good, good, good.
- But my arm!

05:28.870 --> 05:30.496
Listen, just stay tough for me,
okay?

05:30.622 --> 05:32.623
All right, hold on.
I'm going to get you out of here.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.627
Come on! Good girl.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.463
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- That was Lasky, down at headquarters.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.258
Looks like McLeod is making
her final decision today

05:42.384 --> 05:44.301
about which house
she's going to close next.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.470
He thinks it's between us
and Firehouse 17.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.888
Oh, man.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.559
This has got to be weighing
pretty heavy on the Chief.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.562
I just wanted to remind everyone
today is election day

05:54.688 --> 05:55.896
for the union presidency.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.232
Polls will be open all evening
starting at 5:00 p.m.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.152
So I urge you all to
exercise your right to vote.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.987
Unless you plan on
voting for Greg Sullivan.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.156
In which case,
forget what I just said.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.912
Listen, Otis and I, we've been going
over this and going over this

06:12.039 --> 06:14.707
and we think that we need
to involve the cops at this point,

06:14.833 --> 06:17.043
you know,
in an official capacity.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.837
I told you guys I'd take care of it.
Antonio is all over...

06:19.963 --> 06:22.631
No offense, but I feel like we need
to go beyond Antonio at this point.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.091
Reach out to the higher-ups.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.926
Get somebody with
a little bit more juice.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.846
Think you guys just might be
overreacting a tiny bit.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.723
If we stick to the plan
and pay what he wants...

06:30.849 --> 06:33.267
Overreacting? Did you have
something in your eye,

06:33.393 --> 06:37.354
or did you see Game Day
explode into smithereens?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.482
If Arthur's willing
to go that far with them,

06:39.608 --> 06:41.442
you don't think he would
do the same to Molly's?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.944
Has anyone seen Severide?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.404
Nope.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.740
So messed up.
I had to take the bus here.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.118
One... Two... Three...

06:51.244 --> 06:53.162
Ow! I can't!

06:53.288 --> 06:55.247
I can't! Stop! Stop!
My leg! I can't!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.583
Okay, okay. All right.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.710
Ah!

07:01.671 --> 07:04.381
All right. Okay.
Let's take a look at this arm.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.549
Ow!

07:08.345 --> 07:10.137
Nathan, I'm not going to be able
to get you out

07:10.263 --> 07:11.430
unless I try and pull this out.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.432
It's going to be just like ripping
a Band-Aid off.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.976
It's going to hurt at first
and then it'll feel much better.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.853
Ready?

07:25.403 --> 07:28.697
- All right. Okay.
- Ah! Damn it. Damn it.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.866
I think the rebar nicked
an artery in your arm.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.120
Listen, bud, I've got to do something
to get this bleeding under control.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.789
You gotta stay tough for me, okay?
I've got to pinch off this artery.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.256
Okay! I got it.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.091
All right, there we go.
It's done. It's done.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.801
It's done. There we go.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.430
Help! Somebody help us!

07:55.308 --> 07:56.851
Help!

07:59.855 --> 08:02.857
Hey, there he is!
How you feeling, champ? Huh?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.775
Okay. Okay. I was just trying
to be supportive.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.279
I know... I'm just...
I'm nervous about this debate.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.197
There's not a chance that more than
five people

08:10.323 --> 08:12.533
are ever going to hear this thing.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.577
I'll have you know that
more than 600 firefighters

08:14.703 --> 08:16.579
have pre-registered
to hear this debate.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.998
That is the biggest audience
I've ever had.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.875
Oh, okay, hey!
That's great!

08:21.001 --> 08:22.960
- Just be yourself.
- Better than yourself.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.922
- Yeah!
- I've got some great news.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.507
Let's hear it.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.927
I just found out a little something
interesting about Sullivan.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.221
His ex-wife is taking him
to family court

08:34.347 --> 08:36.932
for failure to pay
his child support. Bam!

08:38.101 --> 08:40.269
- And it isn't the first time.
- Are you serious?

08:40.395 --> 08:42.188
Got to hit him with
this hard, Randy.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.565
Yeah, I don't know.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.651
Randy, I know you're all about
maintaining your integrity

08:47.777 --> 08:49.236
throughout this process.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.655
But trust me, we've got to hit him
with everything we've got.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.450
She's got a point, buddy.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.048
- Yeah?
- Detective Helling, Area North.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.467
How can I help you?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.677
I need to have a word
with a few of your firefighters.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.513
What about?

09:16.640 --> 09:20.226
Wait, so you're saying
we're suspects in this?

09:20.352 --> 09:21.936
- Unbelievable.
- Is it?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.771
An old bar goes up in flames.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.149
You three buy the place,
at a great discount I'm sure, fix it up.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.236
Then Game Day comes along.
Suddenly, business ain't so good.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.364
They call the cops on you.
You call the Fire Marshal on them.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.908
That's what we call an escalation.
From there...

09:36.034 --> 09:38.702
Did we have a professional rivalry
with Game Day? Absolutely.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.122
But would we ever consider
in a million years torching the place?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.457
Absolutely not.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.418
We're good, salt of the earth people.
You ask anyone.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.170
Just wanted to let you know
where we stand.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.339
I'll come back with follow-up questions
if I have any.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.347
Hey, Clarke,
have you seen Severide?

09:58.473 --> 10:01.100
The Chief said he had some family
business and to cover for him.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.441
Hey. So, I talked to my friend.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.403
He said he's reviewing
Heather Darden's case personally.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.363
He said minimum security
is a real possibility.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.365
That's great. Thank you.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.242
No worries.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.452
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.498
Thanks for coming.
You ready to do a shift?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.708
Are you sure that's okay?

10:25.834 --> 10:27.668
Are you kidding?
We're lucky to have you.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.171
Somebody blow the bells.
We got a VIP here.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.972
Before you say anything,
you're not suspects, okay?

10:40.098 --> 10:42.057
Someone forgot to tell that
to Detective Helling.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.892
He thinks we burned down
the competition.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.020
I'll make sure he's set straight.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.230
- I'm on this, Gabby.
- Tell that to Game Day.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.357
I was with Arthur when Game Day went up.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.610
Now whether he gave that order ahead
of time, I don't know. I didn't see it.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.448
We are so close here.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.369
I just need him provoked.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.081
What... What are you asking?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.793
The next time he comes to collect,
tell him no dice.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.424
- What are you going to do?
- Just tell him no dice.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.098
I hope you know what you're doing.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.188
- This is it.
- Is this where you sleep?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.273
- Sometimes.
- He's the lucky one.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.484
I got to sleep out here
with the riffraff.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.778
You should try catching
a couple of winks next to Mouch.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.614
It's like the foghorns of Bar Harbor
are all going off...

11:40.408 --> 11:42.076
Truck 81, Squad 3...
Ambulance 61...

11:42.202 --> 11:44.620
Gotta go. We'll do something fun
when I get back, I promise.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.549
Please. My wife.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.389
You've got to help her!

12:03.515 --> 12:05.349
We just need you to back up
so we can do our work.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.490
She's still alive.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.367
She won't be for long
if that steel moves.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.952
It's like a house of cards.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.287
The bike is the only thing
stopping it from crushing her.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.706
We got to stabilize this truck.
It can't move an inch.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.960
Got it. Mouch, chock the wheels.
Otis, kill the engine.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.421
Capp, bring the Jaws.
Tony, I need some cribbing.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.506
Herrmann, I need that other set of jaws.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.634
Hey. Let's take a look at you.
Come on.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.397
Okay, that should hold it
in one piece.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.407
Up in, Capp.
Go nice and easy.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.242
Mind her head.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.878
Okay. Now. Now! Now!

13:16.171 --> 13:17.796
It's going. It's going!

13:22.343 --> 13:25.596
Okay. On my count.
One, two, three!

13:32.896 --> 13:34.646
Wow, right?

13:44.115 --> 13:46.325
Hey, Nathan, you got a phone?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.118
It's in my backpack.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.205
- Where?
- I put it down.

13:56.753 --> 14:00.214
Um, listen, Nathan. You've
been incredible so far, okay?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.215
A superhero.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.343
But I've got to ask you to dig
just a little deeper, okay?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.720
I need you to pinch this
artery tight yourself.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.347
Just for a few seconds.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.600
Okay, just think of it like you're
holding a piece of spaghetti.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.603
I use a fork for spaghetti.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.981
Attaboy.
Okay. You got me there.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.775
Just use your hand.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.027
Use your hand there.
Yeah, take your hand.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.655
Pinch. There you go.
Pinch that.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.574
- I know, I know, I know, I know.
- It hurts so bad.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.661
Just hold your hand as still as
possible, okay? I'll be right back.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.622
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.509
Hi, this is Kelly Severide.
Leave a message.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.512
Hey, Kelly, Chief Boden.

14:48.638 --> 14:52.140
Just checking to see how much longer
you think you're going to be.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.476
I'm probably going to get
a relief lieutenant here

14:54.602 --> 14:57.020
if whatever you got going
is going to take much longer.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.565
So just, uh... Let me know.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.818
Thanks.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.287
Hey. How we doing, bud?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.999
I don't know how much
longer I can hold this.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.417
Okay, hold on.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.754
Damn it!

15:26.050 --> 15:29.052
- Hey, oh! Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.556
You're doing great. Hang in there,
stay tough for me.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.529
There you are. I was going to show you
how to dry the hoses.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.449
Is someone else wearing
my dad's coat now?

15:50.575 --> 15:53.243
Uh... No.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.538
Nobody else is wearing it.
It was, um...

15:58.207 --> 16:00.292
It was damaged in the fire.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.795
That's what I figured.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.676
He's still a very big part
of this house.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.763
Yeah. Everyone keeps saying that.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.106
Hey, that was some quick thinking
out there with the Jaws, man.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.901
- Yo, how'd you know to do that?
- I had to improvise.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.861
In Iraq we were under-equipped
most of the time,

16:27.987 --> 16:29.363
so we had to make do
with what we had.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.157
Yeah, I read about some of
the MacGyvering you guys did

16:32.283 --> 16:33.450
to upgrade gear.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.328
Last thing you wanted was to get caught
with your pants down.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.705
I guess that's the reason
I like what we do, right?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.666
A firefighter needs three things
to survive.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.959
Water, common sense, and balls.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.547
Hello there. Greg Sullivan.
Appreciate your support.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.927
Hi. Greg Sullivan,
running for union president.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.012
Looking forward to
your vote tonight.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.515
Mr Sullivan, I'm Isabella Thompson.
We spoke on the phone.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.393
And aren't you
even prettier in person.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.271
If you'll follow me into the briefing
room, we can get started.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.234
Into the lion's den I go, huh?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.989
Halstead's an undercover cop?

17:14.325 --> 17:15.909
How long have you known about this?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.036
Not long, and I'm sorry
that I didn't tell you guys.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.996
It's just he wanted me
to protect his cover.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.875
He needs us to provoke Arthur
so that he can make a case.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.169
It's show time!

17:27.547 --> 17:28.880
Hey, Greg Sullivan.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.633
Next question goes
to Mr Sullivan.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.387
Mr Sullivan, if elected union president,
what would you do

17:35.513 --> 17:38.181
to better the lives of the firefighters
in this city?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.851
Well, that's a great question,
Brian, I'm glad you asked it.

17:40.977 --> 17:45.605
As your union president, my first order
of business would be to put an end

17:45.732 --> 17:47.691
to the crippling interference
by state officials,

17:47.817 --> 17:50.235
and do away with policies
like the mandatory wellness program.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.573
That's actually a pretty good answer.
And on to you, Mr McHolland.

17:54.699 --> 17:59.578
I would have to say that
I am in agreement with, uh,

17:59.704 --> 18:01.621
Mr Sullivan here.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.459
All right, um... I'm gonna throw
a little curve ball at you guys.

18:05.585 --> 18:10.881
Mr Sullivan, if you could be

18:11.007 --> 18:14.009
any kind of animal, any kind at all,
what would you be?

18:14.135 --> 18:17.387
Well, I know what I wouldn't want to be.
I wouldn't want to be a "Mouch."

18:20.308 --> 18:21.600
- I'm sorry?
- A "Mouch."

18:21.726 --> 18:24.811
You know, half-man, half-couch.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.606
That's Mr. McHolland's nickname
at this firehouse, am I right?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.107
I don't see how that's remotely...

18:29.233 --> 18:32.110
That nickname does
not inspire leadership.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.864
In fact, it implies the opposite.
Laziness. Slovenliness.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.867
Would you care to respond to that,
Mouch... Uh, Mr McHolland?

18:38.993 --> 18:43.580
I don't feel the need to dignify
Mr Sullivan's remarks except to say

18:43.706 --> 18:47.459
that the nickname that he's referring to
is a term of endearment

18:47.585 --> 18:51.838
given to me by my co-workers
out of friendship and respect.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.675
Well, I guess that's to be
expected from Firehouse 51.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.302
Excuse me?

18:57.428 --> 19:01.723
Isn't it true this firehouse has had
its share of scandal in recent years?

19:01.849 --> 19:04.976
A sexual-harassment lawsuit.
A questionable on-duty death.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.772
Not to mention the fostering of a serial
arsonist within its ranks.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.107
I don't know who you think you are,

19:11.234 --> 19:13.360
coming in here
and badmouthing our house.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.736
Just being honest.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.280
Well, you want some honesty?

19:17.406 --> 19:20.492
How about your own personal...

19:33.381 --> 19:35.590
You know what, never mind.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.469
I've said what I need to say.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.686
And we're out of time.
I'd like to thank our two candidates.

19:47.812 --> 19:53.024
And remind everyone that polls open
promptly at 5:00 p.m.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.779
We're going to need
an act of God now.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.623
Hey! Hey, help!

20:08.749 --> 20:10.125
Over here!

20:11.127 --> 20:13.545
Hey, Nathan? Nathan, hey.
Are you with me?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.005
Yeah.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.424
I need you to pinch this
tight again for me, okay?

20:17.550 --> 20:21.636
Come on, you can do this.
A little more.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.890
There you go. I'll be...
I'll be right back.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.563
Hey, I need help!

20:31.689 --> 20:32.814
Hey! Help!

20:39.030 --> 20:43.783
Hey! Over here! Hey! Hey! Help!

20:45.870 --> 20:47.579
Hey!

20:58.799 --> 21:01.176
Nathan! Hey, Nathan!

21:01.302 --> 21:04.804
Hey, wake up, buddy.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.890
Wake up, buddy.
You've got to wake up.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.608
Help!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.624
Wallace.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.845
Thanks for meeting me.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.851
- Have you told the house yet?
- No, I have not.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.520
I'm telling everyone next shift.

21:53.646 --> 21:57.190
You want me to come by and introduce
myself as the new chief after?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.650
No.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.576
I didn't campaign
for your job, Wally.

22:08.703 --> 22:09.869
- No?
- No.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.708
But I want my son to stay safe.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.460
So when it was offered to me,
I took it.

22:18.713 --> 22:21.089
I'm giving up my job to save 51.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.882
I know.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.802
And you've accomplished
your mission.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.180
They're closing 17.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.427
Can I have
your attention please?

23:08.679 --> 23:10.513
Word just came to me.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.432
They're closing Firehouse 17.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.685
I don't mean to be insensitive,
Chief, but...

23:15.811 --> 23:17.604
Does that mean we're safe?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.190
I've been told we are.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.285
Casey.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.707
Benny?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.626
I had no say over
my replacement.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.461
Yeah, but Benny?

23:41.587 --> 23:43.421
Please wait until I announce it
next shift.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.716
I don't need to disrupt
the union vote, it's...

23:49.011 --> 23:50.011
It's Mouch's night.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.015
I'll tell you what I do need.

23:54.141 --> 23:58.186
For you to be a leader.
Now more than ever.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.083
How we doing, Nathan?
You hanging in there?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.839
- Hey, buddy, you still with me?
- I'm here.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.258
Don't give up on me, okay?
I want you to promise me.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.677
I've seen guys a lot bigger
and a lot stronger than you give up

24:30.803 --> 24:32.929
and once they do, you're done.
You're gone.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.849
There's nothing I can do for you,
so I want you to promise me, kid.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.517
I promise.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.144
Yeah. Good. Good man.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.609
Nathan! Why didn't you...

24:46.735 --> 24:48.444
Look at this.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.168
So what were you doing joyriding
in this thing anyway?

25:04.962 --> 25:07.463
My father, he's in construction.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.468
And he promised me over and over again,
ever since I was little,

25:12.595 --> 25:14.387
that he'd teach me
how to drive a loader.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.432
But that was before he left.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.144
I figured I'd teach myself,
so if he ever came back,

25:21.270 --> 25:22.854
I could show him I didn't need him.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.566
I know the feeling, bud.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.404
My dad was a firefighter
and now I am, too.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.616
But I did it without his help.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.451
Is it hard?

25:37.286 --> 25:38.703
Nah, it's the best job in the world.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.874
Look, I'll tell you what.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.251
As soon as we get out of here,
I'll take you to the firehouse

25:45.377 --> 25:47.503
and we'll go for a ride in
the truck. How's that sound?

25:47.630 --> 25:48.755
Cool.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.798
Cool.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.428
Last chance. I can call the
union secretary right now

25:55.554 --> 25:57.597
and send out an email blast
to the entire CFD.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.390
I'm sorry. But no.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.227
I don't understand.
This is the one-yard line.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.229
The last thing anybody heard
is that podcast.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.731
I always said I was going to run
this campaign

26:06.857 --> 26:08.900
on the issues
that affect firefighters.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.819
Personal business is off-limits.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.655
If that means I lose...

26:13.781 --> 26:14.948
It does.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.786
I mean, what've we been
working for here?

26:21.372 --> 26:23.831
I'll take the hit. The email
doesn't have to come from you.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.583
This isn't Washington,
Isabella.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.877
I think he means it.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.592
Fair enough.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.180
I'm going to go home
and get some rest.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.060
Thanks, Randy. I've enjoyed it.
Best of luck tonight.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.478
Thanks.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.318
Damn, I sure do love me
a woman in uniform.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.614
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- I was in the area.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.242
Thought I'd swing by
and check out your digs.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.952
Oh, you did, did ya?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.501
That's my partner, Gabby.
This is Devon.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.796
- We've got a lot of inventory here...
- Mmm-hmm.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.006
When can you get out of here?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.841
My shift goes until tomorrow morning.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.802
- Well, you get a break or something?
- Not officially, but...

27:19.680 --> 27:21.431
Ambulance 61.
Woman in distress.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.850
Hey, why don't you come
on a ride-along?

27:23.976 --> 27:24.851
For real?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.145
We do ride-alongs all the time.
Hop in back.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.569
Hey, with all the eyes
on this house,

27:34.695 --> 27:37.405
you really think it's a good idea
to bring people on ride-alongs?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.490
What, I can't have a friend here?

27:42.077 --> 27:44.329
You know what, Shay?
Whatever you want to do.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.134
She showed up here about 20 minutes ago,
acting all kinds of crazy.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.553
Slapping her own face,
chewing on her hair.

28:05.059 --> 28:06.392
Ha, ha!

28:06.518 --> 28:10.938
I want to be the boom, I want to feel
the weather to be the boom.

28:12.775 --> 28:13.900
You think it's bath salts?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.985
Better prep two milligrams
of midazolam.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.237
People smoke bath salts
like amphetamines these days.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.365
Ha! I want to be the boom.

28:20.491 --> 28:21.866
Hey, ma'am? Hi.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.620
Hey there, we're here
to help you, all right?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.122
Just calm down and
tell me your name.

28:28.248 --> 28:31.376
You want to take it?
Take the boom in me?

28:31.502 --> 28:33.336
No. Just want to help.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.629
Fingerprint me!

28:36.382 --> 28:37.840
You want to
take them off me.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.967
Oh, my God, this chick
is flat whacked!

28:41.637 --> 28:45.264
Don't laugh at me!
You want it? You take it!

28:45.391 --> 28:47.350
Easy, everything's going
to be all right.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.601
Fingerprint that, too!

28:48.727 --> 28:50.645
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

28:55.901 --> 28:55.942
It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.277
It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.326
You're okay.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.873
Okay. Let's get her
on the backboard.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.085
That was wild, man.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.644
Hey, Nathan.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.855
How'd you start this thing, buddy?
There's no key.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.985
Nathan! Hey...

29:41.280 --> 29:45.158
It's easy. You spin the two
contacts with something metal.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.287
What did you use to do it?

29:49.413 --> 29:50.705
Screwdriver.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.788
What's up?

30:32.915 --> 30:34.707
I thought only cops had badges.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.168
Nope. We do, too.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.128
- Wear them on our dress uniforms.
- Really?

30:42.090 --> 30:43.424
What happened to my dad's?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.387
Your mom never took you to see it?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.815
Come on, I'll give you
the nickel tour.

31:10.410 --> 31:13.663
Um... I don't know if you ever
spoke to Kelly today.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.081
No, I haven't.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.834
Well, you tell him
when you see him,

31:18.961 --> 31:21.295
missing today's shift
was unacceptable.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.798
I expect a phone call
and an explanation.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.094
Of course, Chief.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.308
Carry on.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.906
Hey!

31:49.700 --> 31:51.492
Rise and shine, Griffin.
Shift's over.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.495
- We going to get breakfast?
- I have to run an errand.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.339
Kelly? Kelly, you here?

32:07.301 --> 32:08.884
Kelly?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.308
- Kelly?
- No, it's just me.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.811
Have you heard from Severide
at all since yesterday?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.646
No, not since he went jogging.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.735
Give me your car keys.
Thanks, buddy.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.113
I'll be back.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.254
No. Come on. No.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.324
Good morning.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.288
No one was here, so... I figured
I'd just serve myself.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.919
Well, you have to leave.
Right now.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.300
I want my money.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.473
What if I can't pay?

33:40.477 --> 33:46.691
You know, all things considered,
I like to think of myself as a fair man.

33:46.817 --> 33:50.611
I believe in taking people
at their word.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.531
Offering second chances,
that kind of thing.

33:53.657 --> 33:57.493
Now, you take the owners of Game Day.
I gave them a chance to pay.

33:58.829 --> 34:02.415
They refused.
I gave them a second chance.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.127
And once again, they refused.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.052
Then they had that bad luck.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.681
- Arthur, there's no need to...
- Shut up!

34:33.697 --> 34:35.156
Jay!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.500
Drop the gun. You're under arrest.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.002
Son of a bitch.

34:48.128 --> 34:51.338
Put the gun down or I swear to God,
I'm gonna make you eat it.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.348
Don't move!

35:07.606 --> 35:08.606
Hey, you're shot.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.233
Take my phone out of my pocket
and put it to my ear.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.402
You've got to dial 911.

35:15.030 --> 35:18.115
This is Detective Jay Halstead,
badge number 51163.

35:44.935 --> 35:45.976
Nathan?

35:48.605 --> 35:50.481
Buddy?

35:50.607 --> 35:53.567
Nathan, answer me, damn it!
Wake up, bud!

37:13.899 --> 37:15.691
Kelly!

37:18.194 --> 37:19.737
Brachial artery bleed.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.531
I don't know how much longer he can
hold out. We've been at it all night.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.075
Hang on, buddy.
Almost there, all right?

37:25.201 --> 37:27.077
Don't give up on me, okay?

37:46.389 --> 37:50.601
This is Randy. Uh-huh. Yeah.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.896
Uh-huh.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.148
Yeah?

37:56.274 --> 37:58.067
Okay. Thanks.

38:00.403 --> 38:01.987
Well?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.823
I, uh, lost.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.747
Was it even close?

38:15.877 --> 38:18.754
- I ran a good campaign.
- You really did, Mouch.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.674
And who the hell cares
what the numbers were?

38:21.800 --> 38:25.886
You got every vote
where it counts, Firehouse 51.

38:27.305 --> 38:31.266
And I know that I'm sure
as hell proud of you. We all are.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.190
Thanks, guys.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.697
You lucked out, cowboy. It's pretty much
a through and through.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.324
You'll need some stitches,
but otherwise you're fine.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.704
Thanks.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.205
You two okay?

38:54.165 --> 38:55.165
Yeah.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.751
I've got to say, this didn't turn out
the way I thought it would,

38:57.877 --> 38:58.919
but you got the job done.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.587
Yeah, and caught a bullet
in the process.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.339
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.800
Since you were shot on the job,
that means you get to choose...

39:04.926 --> 39:07.386
Intelligence. I want Intelligence.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.765
Yeah, well, let's see
what we can do about that.

39:15.061 --> 39:19.231
You know... This doesn't have to
change things for us.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.319
I wish that were true.

39:25.572 --> 39:27.865
What do you mean?

39:29.159 --> 39:34.329
I mean that when we first met,
I didn't sign up for this.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.624
My brother and sister-in-law have
the best relationship I've ever seen.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.377
Except for when
he goes undercover.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.670
It changes people.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.425
Maybe if the circumstances
were different...

39:49.471 --> 39:51.597
Maybe one day they will be.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.141
Maybe.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.810
What the hell happened?

39:56.936 --> 39:58.812
I saved our damn bar,
that's what happened.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.272
That she did.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.750
"There is no greater love than
to lay down one's life for another."

40:21.795 --> 40:24.713
"This badge case stands as a memorial

40:24.839 --> 40:28.592
to our fallen firefighters
and paramedics

40:28.718 --> 40:35.307
who gave their lives in service
to the citizens of Chicago."

40:52.033 --> 40:54.660
It's okay to cry here.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.913
I have.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.934
Kelly. Kelly.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.188
Mom, this is him.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.316
This is the man who saved me.
