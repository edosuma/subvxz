You should've made him
put it through the letterbox.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.485
I was walking along the side of the road
'cause there was no pavement.

01:40.565 --> 01:44.125
I slipped down this steep bank
and onto some rubbish -

01:44.205 --> 01:47.645
big chunk of wood with, like, a nail,
metal spike sticking out of it -

01:47.725 --> 01:48.885
and went right on it.

01:49.925 --> 01:53.525
Well, it just went right through me,
right through my side,

01:53.805 --> 01:54.805
out my back.

01:54.885 --> 01:56.845
There was blood <i>everywhere.</i>

It's a miracle I'm still alive

'cause the doctor said,
because I'm so big,

02:02.405 --> 02:03.925
it just went straight through me

02:04.005 --> 02:05.645
and missed my vital organs.

02:06.005 --> 02:08.485
-You know, just straight through the--
-Flab.

02:09.085 --> 02:12.005
So, in a way, my fatness saved my life.

02:13.765 --> 02:14.925
Not really.

02:15.445 --> 02:16.685
If you'd have been thin,

02:16.765 --> 02:19.525
the spike would have missed you
altogether, wouldn't it?

02:20.605 --> 02:23.365
You'd just be lying next to a spike.
Not a problem.

02:23.845 --> 02:24.725
Hmm.

03:35.045 --> 03:39.525
take the file P100124.jpg,

03:39.605 --> 03:43.405

Looks like P100125.jpg.

-It's exciting.
-What is?

04:02.085 --> 04:03.085
Journalism.

04:03.165 --> 04:05.725
-This isn't fucking journalism.
-You've gotta start somewhere.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.685
Yeah, but if you start here,
you'll end here.

04:07.765 --> 04:08.765
Look at this.

04:08.845 --> 04:10.725
[Braden] Not true, actually, no.

04:10.805 --> 04:12.645
No, this is a great stepping stone,
this place.

04:12.725 --> 04:14.645
There was a guy
who worked here a while ago,

04:14.725 --> 04:16.965
-went on to work for <i>The Guardian.</i>
-What was his name?

-No, I can't remember his name.
-Oh, he made it big then?

-The point is--
-[Kath] Bill Coombes.

04:24.045 --> 04:25.165
Wasn't here long.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.765
Was a bit grabby.

04:28.245 --> 04:29.645
I do get that a lot though.

[Kath] He's a lorry driver now.

04:35.005 --> 04:36.245
Since the court case.

I didn't know that.
But the point is,<i> </i>okay,

04:40.205 --> 04:43.325
you start here, then you go on
to have a bright future in journalism.

04:43.405 --> 04:45.045
There is no bright future in journalism.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.525
By the time you're a features writer,
there won't be newspapers

04:47.605 --> 04:50.885
as we know them because it'll just be
a shit storm on the Internet.

04:51.205 --> 04:55.085
People posting nasty, fucking hateful
opinions that aren't even theirs

04:55.165 --> 04:58.445
'cause their editor told them to,
to get clickbait for fucking advertisers

04:58.525 --> 05:00.845
because the world
is full of fuckin' morons.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.845
It's <i>awful.</i> It's an <i>awful</i> future.

Tell you what, misery guts.
This might cheer you up... um...

05:07.605 --> 05:09.165
Just been speaking to Jill,

05:09.245 --> 05:11.285
and we might've got you a date.

05:11.565 --> 05:13.245
-For what?
-For...

05:13.485 --> 05:15.845
-Well, we know a lovely lady--
-Oh, a date?

05:15.925 --> 05:16.805
-Yeah.
-Forget it!

05:16.885 --> 05:19.485
Well, hang on. She's also a widow.

05:19.565 --> 05:21.005
So we'd have a lot in common?

05:21.085 --> 05:22.685
-I've told her all about you--
-Yeah?

05:22.765 --> 05:24.085
You told her I'm still married?

05:24.165 --> 05:25.845
-Well, no. I mean--
-To your sister.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.405
-[Braden] No.
-Have you forgotten that?

05:27.485 --> 05:29.245
'Cause I haven't. I still know the deal.

05:29.645 --> 05:33.645
I'm just getting on with stuff
to keep you off my back until it's time.

05:33.725 --> 05:35.805
Because when you see me,
for one moment, you think

05:35.885 --> 05:37.925
I look like I'm enjoying myself
for a split second,

05:38.005 --> 05:41.165
know that in there, I'm still
fucking in pain and the moment's ruined

05:41.245 --> 05:43.645
'cause I can't share it with her, okay?

05:43.725 --> 05:45.565
And I can't fucking wait to be with her.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.245
Tony, that doesn't make sense.
You're a rational man.

05:48.325 --> 05:49.885
You don't even believe in an afterlife.

05:49.965 --> 05:53.765
I know. She's nowhere, all right?
But get this through your head.

05:54.405 --> 05:58.805
I'd rather be nowhere with her
than somewhere without her, all right?

05:59.365 --> 06:02.685
Fucking hell.
Why can't you just leave me alone?

06:03.565 --> 06:04.845
Oh, God!

06:36.685 --> 06:38.405
[Tony]
<i>I've been getting a bit of pressure...</i>

06:39.605 --> 06:41.405
to maybe start dating again.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.525
I say "again." I've never dated.

06:44.085 --> 06:45.205
I don't see the point.

06:45.285 --> 06:47.725
I met someone, by chance,

06:48.525 --> 06:50.445
and she turned out to be perfect,

06:50.525 --> 06:53.565
and... I can't see
that ever happening again.

06:54.005 --> 06:55.485
What about just, um...

06:56.525 --> 06:58.245
-having fun?
-It won't be fun.

06:58.325 --> 07:00.845
Yeah, again, shit attitude, mate.

07:01.165 --> 07:03.325
All this, [feeble voice]
"Oh, where's my soulmate?"

07:03.405 --> 07:06.605
I'm not even sure it's natural
for us to have one mate for life.

07:07.525 --> 07:10.405
It's pretty rare in most species,
I've gotta tell you.

07:11.045 --> 07:14.405
There is... an Australian mouse.

07:15.285 --> 07:17.925
Now, the male lives for a year,

07:18.405 --> 07:21.205
because as soon as it becomes an adult
and it wants to mate,

07:21.285 --> 07:23.005
it goes out and mates...

07:24.125 --> 07:26.205
with about a hundred females.

07:26.365 --> 07:27.885
Literally, it gets the horn,

07:27.965 --> 07:30.525
and it thinks, "Right, I'm gonna shag
everything that moves."

07:30.605 --> 07:32.125
[laughs] And it does.

07:32.845 --> 07:36.045
You know, there's no wooing,
there's no "Are we compatible?"

07:36.125 --> 07:38.245
or "Is she my soulmate?"
There's none of that.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.845
He's just on her,
whether she likes it or not.

07:40.925 --> 07:42.725
I mean, it's basically rape, yeah?

07:43.365 --> 07:45.805
But there's no silly outcry.

07:46.965 --> 07:47.805
And then...

07:48.445 --> 07:49.485
exhausted...

07:52.125 --> 07:52.965
dead.

07:55.325 --> 07:57.405
That's £68, please.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.725
Any plans for the weekend?

08:00.205 --> 08:01.685
Gonna rape myself to death.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.365
-Hi.
-Hello.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.445
-Where's the other one?
-Which one?

08:14.205 --> 08:15.365
Scottish, mouthy.

08:15.725 --> 08:17.885
Emma. Do you want to speak to her?

08:17.965 --> 08:20.005
Er... yeah, please.

08:20.085 --> 08:20.925
Cheers.

08:23.845 --> 08:24.805
You all right, Dad?

08:28.405 --> 08:30.925
-Did you... wanna see me?
-Yeah.

08:33.085 --> 08:33.925
I'm sorry.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.805
What for?

08:36.085 --> 08:37.245
Doesn't matter, apparently.

08:37.325 --> 08:39.445
-What doesn't matter?
-Why I'm apologizing.

08:40.405 --> 08:41.805
I'm apologizing for...

08:42.725 --> 08:44.365
being an arsehole in general.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.565
Oh... right.

08:47.725 --> 08:50.805
So are you apologizing
for being an arsehole so far,

08:50.885 --> 08:53.685
or are you apologizing in advance?

08:58.485 --> 09:01.125
I think you do a great job
with my dad, and...

09:02.165 --> 09:04.005
I don't spend enough time with him.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.765
[Emma] It's all right. You're fine.

09:06.725 --> 09:08.125
I wouldn't worry about your dad.

09:08.765 --> 09:09.605
Cheers.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.085
[Emma] Yeah...

09:12.085 --> 09:13.085
about your dad.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.485
You upset quite a few people today,
didn't you, Ray?

09:18.205 --> 09:19.045
How?

09:19.405 --> 09:23.405
Well, he told Ireney Tindall
that he'd like to do her from behind.

09:23.485 --> 09:24.525
[snickers]

09:24.605 --> 09:26.085
Why from behind?

09:26.165 --> 09:28.485
-I don't really think that's the issue.
-No, sure--

09:28.565 --> 09:29.965
-Ugly.
-[chuckling] Oh, right.

09:30.405 --> 09:33.845
And he accused Charlie Willis
of sucking off Elton John.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.965
[snickering] How old's Charlie Willis?

09:36.045 --> 09:37.325
Eighty-nine. [laughs]

09:37.405 --> 09:38.725
Dirty bastard.

09:40.005 --> 09:42.925
-Anything else? Please say yes.
-Oh, yeah. He told Winston Freeman

09:43.005 --> 09:45.965
that he has the cock of a Chinaman.
[laughing]

09:46.045 --> 09:49.885
How do you know what a Chinaman's co...
You shouldn't even say Chinaman, Dad.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.245
-[Emma laughs hysterically]
-[Tony snickering]

09:53.045 --> 09:55.165
-Ahh.
-[Emma continues laughing]

09:56.645 --> 09:57.845
-Oh.
-Oh.

09:57.925 --> 10:00.885
[Emma chuckling]

10:01.445 --> 10:02.565
That's cheered me up.

10:02.885 --> 10:03.805
Tough day at work?

10:05.645 --> 10:06.485
I...

10:07.645 --> 10:10.805
Some of the guys are trying to get me
to go on a date.

10:10.885 --> 10:11.725
Mmm.

10:12.525 --> 10:15.685
Well, you should probably
go on a date, then. [laughs nervously]

10:17.445 --> 10:20.005
-Right, I'd better get back to work.
-Oh, okay.

10:20.085 --> 10:21.525
-[Emma] All right, bye.
-Cheers.

10:22.925 --> 10:24.405
[Emma] All right, Ireney?

10:29.205 --> 10:30.285
Here she is.

10:30.765 --> 10:32.445
Get in here, you dirty cow.

10:36.605 --> 10:39.005
My brother-in-law
wants me to try dating again.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.085
Oh, excellent.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.085
You need some tips.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.605
Why would I need some tips?

10:46.765 --> 10:48.885
Well, I imagine you're awful with women.

10:49.685 --> 10:50.525
Yeah?

10:51.045 --> 10:52.245
She's having a go, Stan.

10:52.725 --> 10:54.085
Well, all men are awful,

10:54.165 --> 10:56.285
but grumpy, selfish ones are the worst.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.245
Oh, all right. Let me take notes.
This is dynamite. Go on.

11:00.045 --> 11:03.365
Well, go on. What are you going to say
to her? I'll be your date.

11:04.525 --> 11:05.645
What, role-play?

11:06.245 --> 11:07.125
If you like.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.205
Hi, I'm Tony.

11:17.685 --> 11:19.445
I don't wanna appear ageist,

11:19.845 --> 11:23.085
-but are those your own teeth?
-[laughing]

11:24.445 --> 11:26.285
That's probably a bad start,
is it, getting hit?

11:26.365 --> 11:27.445
No.

11:28.085 --> 11:29.565
It's good. You made me laugh,

11:29.645 --> 11:32.925
but I'm assuming
that your date isn't as old as me.

11:33.005 --> 11:34.005
Fuckin' hope not.

11:35.885 --> 11:38.325
Swearing. Be serious!

11:38.405 --> 11:39.605
I can't. I...

11:40.525 --> 11:41.645
I'd just be honest.

11:42.085 --> 11:44.765
Tell her my situation,
tell her what I'm going through,

11:44.845 --> 11:46.125
be honest up front, and...

11:47.565 --> 11:49.165
So just all about you, then?

11:49.685 --> 11:51.685
What? I can't win, can I?

11:52.005 --> 11:53.485
I don't wanna date again.

11:54.205 --> 11:55.885
I don't wanna live without Lisa.

11:57.565 --> 11:59.525
But it's not just all about you, is it?

12:00.245 --> 12:01.405
That's what I'm saying.

12:02.205 --> 12:05.325
What if a nice date made <i>her </i>feel good?

12:06.525 --> 12:08.125
That might feel nice, right?

12:09.325 --> 12:11.845
We're not just here for us,
we're here for others.

12:11.925 --> 12:13.605
I don't do the whole God thing,
I'm afraid.

12:13.685 --> 12:15.445
[Anne] No, neither do I. Load of rubbish.

12:15.525 --> 12:17.125
All we've got is each other.

12:17.685 --> 12:20.125
We've got to help each other
struggle through till we die,

12:20.205 --> 12:21.405
and then we're done.

12:21.485 --> 12:23.165
No point in feeling sorry for ourselves

12:23.245 --> 12:24.965
and making everyone else unhappy, too.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.125
Might as well top yourself
if you feel like that.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.485
Are you sure you wanna work
for the Samaritans?

12:30.805 --> 12:32.325
All I'm saying is that...

12:32.605 --> 12:34.245
I think that deep down,

12:34.925 --> 12:37.125
that you still think life's worth living.

12:37.205 --> 12:39.205
It's nowhere near over for you.

12:40.205 --> 12:41.205
You're in pain.

12:43.525 --> 12:44.805
But the thing you lost...

12:45.685 --> 12:47.805
is the same thing that can stop that pain.

12:51.685 --> 12:52.885
[laughs softly]

13:03.765 --> 13:05.885
-[Braden] I'm sorry.
-It's fine, seriously.

13:05.965 --> 13:06.965
No, it's... I...

13:07.605 --> 13:08.685
I shouldn't have, um...

13:10.005 --> 13:10.845
I'll, um...

13:11.485 --> 13:13.205
I'll do the date.

13:13.885 --> 13:15.045
Really?

13:15.125 --> 13:18.005
Great. Well, I'll call her
and book a restaurant.

13:18.645 --> 13:20.045
Um, Indian okay?

13:20.605 --> 13:22.165
Yeah. I don't care what she is.

13:23.405 --> 13:25.085
No, I meant, um, food.

13:25.445 --> 13:27.205
Oh. Er...

13:27.565 --> 13:30.645
No, Italian would be best.
Soak up the alcohol.

13:31.925 --> 13:33.365
Okay. Yeah, I'll book that.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.125
[Braden] Great.

13:39.365 --> 13:40.805
So, what are you gonna wear?

13:41.965 --> 13:44.285
-Why?
-Well, first impressions are important.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.805
I mean, look at me and June.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.845
She'd noticed my style
before my personality.

13:49.125 --> 13:52.685
I don't care about first impre...
I don't care about <i>any </i>impression, do I?

13:52.765 --> 13:54.605
If you want any help,
I could give you tips.

13:55.285 --> 13:59.245
He's had a girlfriend for about a minute
and he thinks he's Bryan fucking Ferry.

13:59.885 --> 14:02.365
And why do people think
I need tips with women?

14:02.445 --> 14:03.445
Tips on style.

14:03.525 --> 14:04.685
[Tony] Tips on style?

14:04.925 --> 14:05.765
From you?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.045
-Yeah.
-[Tony] Go on.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.805
-[Lenny] Okay. Lunch or dinner?
-What difference does that make?

14:09.885 --> 14:12.285
Well, for dinner,
she might wear a ball gown,

14:12.365 --> 14:14.645
in which case
you'll wanna wear a dress suit.

14:14.725 --> 14:17.125
But for lunch, you'll probably
get away with blazer and slacks?

14:17.205 --> 14:19.645
-Slacks?
-Are you from the 1940s?

14:19.725 --> 14:21.325
-No need to wear a suit.
-I won't.

14:21.405 --> 14:23.925
-Smart jeans, a nice shirt.
-Exactly, yeah.

14:24.005 --> 14:25.725
Have you got smart jeans
and a nice shirt?

14:28.005 --> 14:29.245
-Er...
-[Lenny] Hm.

14:29.565 --> 14:31.485
I'll take you shopping, if you like.

14:31.565 --> 14:33.165
But remember, black is slimming.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.525
Can't work miracles though, can it?

14:36.085 --> 14:37.205
Cheers, thank you.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.645
[weakly] I don't need to go shopping.

14:39.725 --> 14:40.845
-[Sandy] Come on.
-Really?

14:40.925 --> 14:41.805
Yeah.

14:41.885 --> 14:43.405
Ah, it's embarrassing.

14:43.645 --> 14:44.525
No, it's not.

14:44.605 --> 14:47.845
It is.
A grown man being told what to wear.

14:49.285 --> 14:50.165
Go in here.

14:50.245 --> 14:51.565
[dance music from shop]

14:51.645 --> 14:53.885
-Fuck off.
-[Sandy laughs]

14:55.125 --> 14:56.045
[Tony groans]

14:57.765 --> 15:00.165
-[Tony, shouting] Do you take requests?
-What?

15:01.045 --> 15:02.405
Have you got any Bee Gees?

15:04.605 --> 15:05.485
[music quietens]

15:05.565 --> 15:08.085
-What do you mean?
-Oh, sorry, I thought this was a disco.

15:08.685 --> 15:09.765
He's very old.

15:10.805 --> 15:11.885
Are you two together?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.485
-No.
-No, I was gonna say...

15:18.885 --> 15:21.005
Got one of these in 42 chest?

15:25.765 --> 15:26.805
[chuckles]

15:27.565 --> 15:28.925
-Be nice.
-Yeah.

15:29.005 --> 15:29.925
[Sandy chuckles]

15:34.245 --> 15:36.725
It's not a waste of time,
you working here.

15:37.285 --> 15:40.045
It is a good stepping stone,
and you can go on and do...

15:40.525 --> 15:42.285
anything you want. I didn't...

15:43.365 --> 15:44.365
'cause I didn't want to.

15:44.445 --> 15:45.805
I didn't do overtime,

15:46.485 --> 15:47.845
try and get promoted, or...

15:48.525 --> 15:50.925
get a better job in a different town.
I just...

15:51.645 --> 15:54.405
I just wanted to get home every night...

15:55.805 --> 15:58.845
spend every available minute
I could with Lisa.

16:01.405 --> 16:02.925
And I made the right decision.

16:04.805 --> 16:05.845
That's so lovely.

16:05.925 --> 16:07.845
Don't cry.
Not in front of your new boyfriend.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.325
-[curtain swishes]
-Here he comes.

16:09.645 --> 16:10.525
Hi.

16:10.805 --> 16:12.845
It just won't look as good in this size.

16:17.285 --> 16:20.565
[Tony] I could see the look of
disappointment when I went in his shop.

16:20.645 --> 16:21.765
-Hello.
-[Tony] You all right?

16:21.845 --> 16:22.685
Yeah.

16:23.885 --> 16:26.725
This is Sandy, who works for me.

16:26.805 --> 16:27.965
-Hello, Sandy.
-Hello.

16:28.045 --> 16:29.685
-[Tony] This is...
-Nice to meet you.

16:29.765 --> 16:30.645
...Daphne,

16:31.445 --> 16:33.885
who's a cleaner, my cleaner.

16:35.925 --> 16:36.765
Yeah.

16:37.365 --> 16:38.285
I'm his cleaner.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.725
Er...

16:39.805 --> 16:42.925
Not his friend or anything with a job
he's embarrassed about on my behalf.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.005
Anyway,

16:44.085 --> 16:46.645
I was just on my way to your house
to do some cleaning,

16:46.725 --> 16:49.645
and I forgot my keys,
so it's lucky we ran into each other.

16:49.725 --> 16:52.845
But he's just gonna give me his
'cause I'm his cleaner.

16:52.925 --> 16:54.605
-It's not a problem, is it?
-No.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.885
You trust your cleaner.
Give your keys to your cleaner.

16:57.205 --> 16:59.165
It's not like giving them
to a prostitute, is it?

17:00.285 --> 17:01.725
-See you later!
-Hope so.

17:08.885 --> 17:09.885
You all right, George?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.445
[door shuts, keys jangle]

17:20.605 --> 17:21.845
You left the keys in the door.

17:22.365 --> 17:23.765
-Did I?
-Yeah.

17:26.645 --> 17:27.485
That's amazing.

17:29.045 --> 17:30.485
Can't believe you've done all this.

17:30.565 --> 17:32.245
I can't believe you gave me your keys.

17:32.405 --> 17:33.685
I didn't wanna back down.

17:33.765 --> 17:34.925
I know.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.045
How much do I owe you?

17:38.765 --> 17:39.685
Nothing.

17:40.005 --> 17:41.965
Just wanted to see if you trusted me.

17:42.325 --> 17:43.605
Sorry about the whole...

17:43.805 --> 17:44.965
saying you're my cleaner.

17:45.045 --> 17:46.925
I thought you'd prefer it to prostitute.

17:47.005 --> 17:48.005
Sex worker.

17:48.085 --> 17:50.365
And only 'cause people prejudge you
when you say that,

17:50.445 --> 17:53.525
and I don't wanna scare the new girl.
"This is my friend, she's a prostitute."

17:53.605 --> 17:55.085
-Sex worker.
-Right.

17:55.965 --> 17:56.925
No worries.

17:58.005 --> 17:59.005
D'you want a coffee?

17:59.085 --> 18:00.285
No, I've just had one.

18:00.725 --> 18:02.565
Actually, I've got to be going.

18:04.245 --> 18:06.245
You sure I can't give you anything
for this?

18:06.325 --> 18:08.085
No, it's my pleasure.

18:08.925 --> 18:10.605
Not everyone is out to get you, Tony.

18:11.045 --> 18:13.885
Most people are all right.
They're just having a bad day.

18:14.645 --> 18:17.765
Sometimes they don't think, they get
caught up. They're just trying to survive.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.845
Bad things happen to good people,
good things happen to bad people,

18:21.925 --> 18:22.965
and sometimes...

18:23.805 --> 18:25.085
it's just no one's fault.

18:27.405 --> 18:28.245
Cheers.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.565
Right, shoes on. See you later, mate.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.325
See you later.

18:34.605 --> 18:36.925
[quietly] Good girl.

18:39.325 --> 18:40.325
[door closes]

18:44.285 --> 18:46.205
-[cutlery clattering]
-[sighs]

18:46.285 --> 18:47.445
[buttons clicking]

18:47.525 --> 18:48.365
Uh-uh-uh.

18:55.205 --> 18:56.045
Good.

18:57.205 --> 18:59.045
I should say from the off,

19:00.205 --> 19:03.525
I didn't want to do this,
but Matt said you're a widow, too,

19:03.605 --> 19:06.605
and, you know, absolutely nothing,
apart from eating,

19:07.285 --> 19:08.325
could ever come of this

19:08.405 --> 19:10.845
because I'm still attached to my wife,

19:10.925 --> 19:13.245
and... I'm just being honest.

19:13.525 --> 19:15.965
Is this your way of saying
we're gonna split the bill?

19:16.045 --> 19:17.245
Erm, champagne.

19:17.485 --> 19:20.245
Definitely splitting the bill.
Whiskey, please.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.605
-[waiter] Any sort?
-Large.

19:21.685 --> 19:22.965
Oh, discerning.

19:23.045 --> 19:25.485
You know what?
It's a mouthful of painkiller.

19:25.645 --> 19:28.125
This is good schtick.
You know, dark and down.

19:28.205 --> 19:31.245
But you're obviously not really suicidal.
It's just bullshit.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.405
Right, that's where you're wrong.

19:33.485 --> 19:36.285
[woman] No, I know the story.
But seriously, though,

19:36.365 --> 19:38.365
how hard is suicide?

19:38.805 --> 19:40.005
My husband did it.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.325
Threw himself off Beachy Head,
hit the rocks,

19:43.405 --> 19:46.845
skull exploded. Poof! Efficient.

19:47.245 --> 19:49.805
He was shit at everything else,
but I've gotta give him his due.

19:49.885 --> 19:52.405
He really knew what he was doing
when it came to suicide.

19:53.005 --> 19:54.525
-Wow.
-Wow indeed.

19:54.605 --> 19:57.085
And, no, I'm not grieving. He was a cunt.

19:57.365 --> 19:59.885
Well, I'm sure
you gave as good as you got.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.685
-Oh, I did.
-Oh, I believe you.

20:02.645 --> 20:04.445
Why are you so sarcastic all the time?

20:05.445 --> 20:08.245
'Cause it stops me killing people,
including myself.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.525
-Gotta do what you gotta do.
-You have, indeed... and...

20:13.605 --> 20:15.725
I... nearly took some pills.

20:15.805 --> 20:18.485
You <i>nearly </i>took some pills?
Jesus Christ.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.805
-What is wrong with you?
-No, what is wrong with <i>you?</i>

20:20.885 --> 20:24.685
-Why couldn't you go through with it?
-Because I had to look after my dog.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.885
-That's an excuse.
-It's not an excuse. It's a reason.

20:26.965 --> 20:29.205
Because I realized that my wife

20:29.485 --> 20:33.805
was probably the only human being
I actually liked, and my dog is second.

20:33.885 --> 20:35.365
Well, maybe I could come third.

20:35.445 --> 20:36.525
Yeah, good luck.

20:36.925 --> 20:38.445
No, but I do get it.

20:38.525 --> 20:41.965
Some people just feel more comfortable
around animals then they do around people.

20:42.045 --> 20:45.525
I'm comfortable around humans.
I just think animals are better.

20:45.605 --> 20:47.005
That's because you're hurt

20:47.085 --> 20:50.125
and you've lost someone
and you think no one compares. Mmm.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.405
No one does compare.

20:52.005 --> 20:52.845
No offense.

20:52.925 --> 20:53.965
No, none taken.

20:54.245 --> 20:56.845
And the reason
animals are better than people

20:56.925 --> 20:58.965
is because they just get on with it.

20:59.045 --> 21:01.325
-They don't <i>whinge</i> all the time--
-Unlike you.

21:01.405 --> 21:02.325
What d'you mean?

21:02.405 --> 21:05.325
You haven't stopped whinging
since we got here. No offense.

21:07.405 --> 21:08.685
-Well, this is nice.
-Mmm.

21:09.965 --> 21:11.925
-Cheers, thanks.
-Cheers.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.525
-Can I tell you about the specials?
-[together, sighing] No.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.325
Fuckin' hell.

[engine roaring]

21:30.965 --> 21:32.125
[engine approaching]

21:32.205 --> 21:33.085
Good.

21:34.525 --> 21:36.125
-[biker] Fuckin' let go!
-Fuck off!

-[biker groans]
-[metallic clank]

21:41.605 --> 21:42.445
[biker] Cunt!

21:52.125 --> 21:53.885
-Well, that was really silly.
-Why?

21:54.325 --> 21:56.765
Well, they could have had some acid
or stabbed you or something.

21:56.845 --> 21:57.805
Told you...

21:58.245 --> 21:59.965
-I don't care.
-What if they'd stabbed me?

22:00.045 --> 22:00.965
[snickers]

22:01.045 --> 22:02.565
-Oh, cheers!
-Pleasure.

22:17.885 --> 22:18.765
Me again.

22:19.045 --> 22:20.565
This must be why they call it a habit.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.445
-Yep.
-Yep.

22:26.085 --> 22:27.965
[Tony] You know I know how you feel?

22:28.965 --> 22:30.645
Okay, try imagining if...

22:31.605 --> 22:34.045
everyone you told
about your wife dying just...

22:35.245 --> 22:36.805
thought it was her own fault.

22:38.405 --> 22:39.285
What d'you mean?

22:41.285 --> 22:43.125
Well, Mel was an addict, wasn't she?

22:43.765 --> 22:45.205
She injected herself, so...

22:45.965 --> 22:47.965
you know, most people just think
it was her fault.

22:49.325 --> 22:51.565
They don't feel the same sympathy

22:51.645 --> 22:53.365
for me or for her. I mean...

22:54.005 --> 22:57.125
Every minute of every day
that I have my wits about me,

22:57.205 --> 22:58.565
all I can think about is...

22:58.925 --> 23:01.805
getting some gear
before I become too fucking conscious.

23:04.565 --> 23:05.485
When I was with...

23:06.445 --> 23:07.325
Lisa,

23:08.285 --> 23:10.685
we'd sort of get home,
open a bottle of wine...

23:11.365 --> 23:13.725
and go, "Yay! Just us. Let's party."

23:14.645 --> 23:15.685
And by "party,"

23:16.245 --> 23:19.485
I mean... sit here like this,
with the dog,

23:20.405 --> 23:23.485
watching telly,
or listening to music, or just talking.

23:23.565 --> 23:25.485
Just, the more we talked,

23:26.685 --> 23:27.645
the more we drank.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.525
We didn't want the night to end.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.125
Now I drink...

23:34.805 --> 23:36.365
'cause I <i>want </i>the night to end.

23:38.045 --> 23:40.765
It's like I'm already dead inside,
and yet I'm still...

23:41.445 --> 23:42.965
in the worst kind of pain.

23:45.205 --> 23:46.125
Well...

23:47.565 --> 23:48.925
as long as we're having fun.

23:49.645 --> 23:50.525
[snorts]

23:51.085 --> 23:53.605
I still can't believe
we've got so much in common.

23:55.005 --> 23:56.965
We don't have anything in common.

23:57.045 --> 23:58.285
Why do you say that, though?

23:58.365 --> 24:00.445
Well... the big difference is...

24:02.125 --> 24:04.125
you haven't given up yet, have you?

24:05.245 --> 24:07.725
I mean, me, I would quite happily
die right now.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.245
If I had enough money,

24:11.445 --> 24:14.565
I would just... I would take as many drugs
as I possibly could.

24:33.085 --> 24:34.045
[Tony sighs]

24:40.205 --> 24:42.165
