00:16.099 --> 00:17.934
<i>That's what humans do, isn't it?</i>

00:19.769 --> 00:21.062
<i>Our great leg up.</i>

00:21.604 --> 00:24.357
<i>We roll. We hack.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:26.693
<i>Knuckle down and change.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:40.915
<i>Even </i>Snowpiercer <i>is an adaptation.</i>

00:41.875 --> 00:43.460

00:48.339 --> 00:52.510

00:56.556 --> 00:59.267
<i>Mr. Wilford dusted off his train set.</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:15.867
Snowpiercer <i>is his system.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:19.704
<i>Systems resist change,</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:26.586

<i>I'm here to save the world, not change it.</i>

01:28.671 --> 01:31.883
<i>I know our chances of surviving</i>

01:32.383 --> 01:36.054
<i>All I can do about that is provide</i>

02:07.043 --> 02:07.877
Yeah?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.297
Hey.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.716
I knew you'd be up.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.886
No rest for the weary. What's up?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.140
I need you to take care of yourself, Mel.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.892
-We can't afford you getting sick.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.228
There's mounting supply chain issues,

02:25.311 --> 02:27.981
and now you're taking
this murder investigation on your own?

02:28.064 --> 02:29.649
I appreciate your concern.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.526
I do.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.737
Anything else?

02:35.530 --> 02:36.906
Yes.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.492
I want you to ask for help.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
Help.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.509
Layton, wake up. We need you.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.053
-What happened?
-You'll see.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.019
-Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.439
So...

03:10.064 --> 03:12.609
have you thought of a workaround
for the methane shortage?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.905
Yup. Goat farts.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.033
Very good.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.911
-MIT.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.370
I knew it would pay off.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.252
Melanie Cavill.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.342
I'm not afraid to be seen together.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.094
You just don't want to walk
to work with me in the morning?

03:40.178 --> 03:44.015
Jinju, there's enough track talk
about me as it is.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.061
Hey, you gotta step up for this, babe.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.024
-Isn't that what I just did?
-Oh, you did, huh?

03:54.484 --> 03:58.279
And I will. I just...
You know, give me a minute.

03:59.197 --> 04:02.075
These Thirdies are weird
about dating uptrain.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.286
Well, what's the difference
whether it's uptrain or downtrain?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.163
You're from Second.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.624
You have the privilege
of seeing it that way.

04:11.376 --> 04:17.173
Okay, baby, I know you're not enticed
by all this 'cause you're from Detroit.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.467
Hey.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.844
I'm from San Francisco.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.846
Those places are gone.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.100
But now it's up to us to start over.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.861
Agricultural Officer.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.072
Nikki GenÃªt is dead.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.007
I'm sorry.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.093
I know how much you cared for her.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.846
Okay. Stop now.

05:06.055 --> 05:06.973
Stop it, Henry.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.603
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make things right with Mr. Wilford.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.147
Thank you.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.275
I'm so sorry.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.485
I want you to go get a gurney
and some sheets.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.990
Don't let anyone see her.
We need postmortem data.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.160
-Do you understand what I'm asking you?
-Yes.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.829
Will you do that for me, Henry?

05:32.498 --> 05:33.416
Thank you.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.800
Where were you?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.721
I gave you a description
of a First Class killer.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.222
What did you do with it?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.729
I was waiting till morning.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.565
First waits till morning.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.695
She's dead, and our killer
gets his bacon and eggs.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.448
Shut it, Layton.
We all failed her.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.704
The border is closed.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.625
I just came from Second.
It's been closed since the fight.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.794
The killer's from First.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.545
If he followed you,
he left the fight early.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.255
No time to get uptrain.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.424
Then he's still in Third.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.897
How we doin'?

06:38.439 --> 06:41.526
Switching to breakfast.
Round and round she goes.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.153
-You want one last Railman's?
-No.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.992
Any word on how long
they're keeping that damn border closed?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.913
They'll close it all night if they want.
That fight was a mess.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.917
Where you from? Second?

06:58.668 --> 06:59.669
Yeah.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.313
Hey,
these are First Class booze tokens.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.401
I mean, thanks.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.490
All right, how many men
do you have uptrain?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.367
We've got plenty.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.995
Okay, send a sweep team
uptrain from the Tail.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.914
Eyes up, son. We've got it from here.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.168
Mr. Layton doesn't really
need to see this, does he?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.879
They don't even know who they're chasing.
I need to go to First.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.297
He doesn't set one foot in First.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.800
He does whatever Mr. Wilford wants, yes?

07:48.593 --> 07:51.137
Let's get every First Class passenger
that was at the fight out of bed.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.347
-That will not be popular.
- "Popular"?

07:53.431 --> 07:56.100
- You people have a serial killer.
-Okay.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.729
Tone it down, would you?

07:59.812 --> 08:02.231
I need to know
that the search is underway,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.984
and then... you and I will go to First.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.614
You have to clear that with Mr. Wilford
or is that your call?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.748
When you're ready, I'll be talking to her.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.083
All right.
My Brakemen will work down from here.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.628
We'll open every door.
We'll check every cupboard.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.922
And meet my men in the middle, in Ag-Sec.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.591
Start a sweep team
uptrain from the Tail end.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.511
From there
we will work through all the...

08:31.594 --> 08:34.931
...in identifying the next victim
based on intel.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.391
What about the subtrain?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.185
It's still closed
to nonessential personnel.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.978
I'll put another patrol
down there anyway.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.358
-He's not suspended?
-We're shorthanded.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.318
-We need every man we got.
-He was slinging Kroney.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.486
He's your partner.

08:48.569 --> 08:52.281
Work it out now, work it out later.
Just do your freakin' job. Go.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.879
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:10.466 --> 09:15.388
If the killer's from First,
they'll only let you get so far.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.557
And there won't be any justice for Nikki.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.769
How's Third gonna take that?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.356
Both victims are theirs.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.110
Huh. That remains to be seen, Detective.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.825
Now that I got a sense
of what you do here,

09:35.908 --> 09:37.577
I thought you might have a take on it.

09:39.370 --> 09:43.499
You know people, high and low.
You know their secrets.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.628
Strict confidentiality.
It's assured in the Nightcar.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.507
-I appreciate that.
-Mmm.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.261
Melanie Cavill ever have a session?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.931
That would be confidential,
if the answer wasn't no.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.850
She's never shown herself like that.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.605
Maybe now she'll have to.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.611
You think Nikki's death
could be a catalyst?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.363
Catalyst for what?

10:15.281 --> 10:18.492
From what I hear, a lot of workers
in Third are pretty fed up.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.913
You need to step carefully, Detective.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.168
But many of us do want change.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.591
We're waking First.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.971
Audrey, I promise,
I'll do everything I can--

10:39.055 --> 10:40.222
Cut the shit, Melanie.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.142
You have my support, Detective.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.525
I'm holding the subtrain.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.570
Not a lot of downtrain faith
that the powers that be

10:54.654 --> 10:58.783
actually want to solve this thing,
now that the suspect's from First.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.076
I want it solved.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.537
And it doesn't matter
which class the suspect is from.

11:05.081 --> 11:05.998
Let's go.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.631
Oh, I've never seen
a blue chip before.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.676
Could be First Class, open heaps of doors.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.428
Layton said, "It's only doors between us."

11:19.512 --> 11:21.013
You can't just chip out of the Tail.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.058
No, but someone could
chip out of Sanitation crew.

11:24.141 --> 11:28.104
The break room has that door
with a keypad. They think we can't use it.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.939
You've been stashing
supplies there, right?

11:30.022 --> 11:32.191
-Yeah, things we scrounge on shift.
- Any clothes?

11:32.733 --> 11:35.778
Okay, so if we get someone
in the corridors, then what?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.154
We make contact with Astrid.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.115
Since she apprenticed out
in the first year...

11:40.366 --> 11:43.244
guys, we've heard from her, what? Twice?

11:43.327 --> 11:46.122
Astrid's still one of us.
She's got people here.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.999
If she can find Layton,
we can set up communication with him.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.503
Give me the chip. I'll try it tonight.

12:02.304 --> 12:07.685
John, you're a lion,
but they don't see Tailie women uptrain.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.854
I've got a better chance of blending in.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.106
It's true.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.318
Come here.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.281
This is the only key we've ever had.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.001
Sanitation.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.223
-Hey. What happened to your friend?
-He's too sick to work, sir.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.851
Okay.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.457
Strip.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.960
Inhuman.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.585
You gotta be kidding me.
Art belongs to First now?

13:58.462 --> 14:02.258
These people broiled the Earth,
then they froze her.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.134
Now they hang the spoils on their walls.

14:04.218 --> 14:08.722
Layton, I was born
on a dirt farm in eastern Pennsylvania.

14:09.557 --> 14:13.602
I came from nothing.
I know a thing or two about class.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.273
That anger that you feel
when you look at all of this,

14:18.190 --> 14:19.400
it's justified.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.985
Let's use it.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.072
Whoever the killer is,
First is going to protect their own.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.700
So you be their worst nightmare
from the Tail.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.244
I'll do the rest.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.307
The Tailie.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.609
-All right, two things first.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.527
I don't give a shit who you are.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.698
And somebody up here has got a thing
for chopping off Third Class dicks.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.620
-Now, look--
- Yeah. I'm looking.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.373
Here's the thing...

15:17.249 --> 15:18.250
Ruth,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.420
I don't see everybody
who was at the fight.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.547
This is everybody.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.549
Melanie, this is ridiculous.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.636
No one from First Class
has ever been charged with a crime.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140
You should thank her for that.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.770
She keeps the borders tight,
she keeps the rabble at bay,

15:38.395 --> 15:40.856
and she keeps First Class
above the law. But...

15:41.565 --> 15:43.692
Mr. Wilford's doing things
differently this time.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.780
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.115
Now...

15:52.368 --> 15:53.994
where are the bodyguards?

15:57.414 --> 15:59.375
All right, let me try this
a different way.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.797
How many arms did you take in the Tail?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.509
Fourteen...

16:09.718 --> 16:11.178
if anyone's counting.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.807
So, where are the bodyguards?

16:17.142 --> 16:18.936
I didn't invite the help.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.272
Erik didn't come home last night.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.775
He didn't?

16:26.068 --> 16:26.902
No.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.699
He asked to leave the fight early,
and when we came back, he wasn't here.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.994
You knew he was missing
and you didn't tell us?

16:36.578 --> 16:38.288
Tell Roche Erik's a suspect.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.916
-He has his gun, too.
-LJ.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.460
What? I saw he had it with him last night.

16:43.544 --> 16:47.923
He has his gun? There are
no guns allowed on the <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

16:48.549 --> 16:51.051
Our security was allowed
to keep their sidearm.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.263
The rest of us were disarmed
to keep you safe.

16:55.597 --> 16:59.268
-I'm gonna need to see Erik's quarters.
-This man is not entering our carriage.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.022
Letting this man into First?
This is unprecedented.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.900
On behalf of everyone here,
I demand to speak to Mr. Wilford.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.863
It's time, Melanie.

17:36.013 --> 17:36.889
This is Bennett.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.724
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I need you to put me through to him.</i>

17:38.807 --> 17:39.767
<i>It's urgent.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:42.269
Oh, hey. We doing this again?

17:42.352 --> 17:43.896
Thank you, I'll wait.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.899
Anything to put a smile on your face.

17:48.150 --> 17:53.238
Mr. Wilford, good news first.
We may have identified the killer.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.866
Is that for real?
Or is that part of the act?

17:55.949 --> 17:59.536
Yes, a bodyguard from First.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.415
But the family is reluctant
to let your detective in to investigate,

18:03.499 --> 18:04.917
and they would like a word.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.753
Well, that would piss me right off.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.296
Huff, huff, huff.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.925
The Folgers. It's their man.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.719
Yes, Lilah Folger, sir.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.431
-I know, but she's demanding it.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.936
Very good.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.829
For the investigation,
we will allow him in,

18:41.912 --> 18:43.747
but only if you accompany him.

18:49.670 --> 18:54.174
Mr. Wilford, my apologies.
It seems everything is sorted.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.010
- <i>I miss you, Mel.</i>
-Thank you for that.

18:57.970 --> 18:58.971
Goodbye, sir.

20:20.969 --> 20:21.970
Thirty minutes.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.478
Here you go.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.146
All the piss and shit left in the world.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.856
-You get used to the smell...
-Quick, let's go.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.024
...just not the cholera.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.442
Cholera's not so bad.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.780
All right, then, quick.
Let's go before they get here.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.114
Pass me that.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.157
Pajamas?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.326
Yeah, it's the middle of the night.
Kinda works, huh?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.537
That's right. Better hurry.
Let's go. Quick. Hurry up.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.580
Pass it to me.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.583
There you go.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.379
Good luck.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.650
Is he going to go
through all of our things?

21:16.733 --> 21:19.528
- Should we offer him a drink?
- No, thanks, LJ.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.118
He was 7th Marines,
then he worked private security.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.327
What else can you tell me about him?

21:27.411 --> 21:30.247
We hired him when the Freeze started
to keep our family safe.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.873
-And he did.
- Oh.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.918
And he saved my life.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.628
How'd he do that?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.048
It's not pertinent, LJ.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.679
Anybody seen this before?

21:46.763 --> 21:48.015
What is it?

21:48.098 --> 21:50.642
It's a J hook. Used for beekeeping.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.859
What? He showed it to me.
He said he found it.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.738
-Where?
-I don't know. Scrounging.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.656
The old apiary.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.952
We used to keep bees,
until a colony collapse three years ago.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.622
They crated up all the extra hives
and everything. They're in storage.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
Well, we need to find which crate.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.209
Can you send Till?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.005
May I?

22:22.632 --> 22:25.135
Lilah, let's us three
go into the other room.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.804
We can position this in a way
that's best for your family.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.159
Brakeman Till.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.296
Josie.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.592
How... How did... Are you out of the Tail?

23:05.675 --> 23:07.385
No questions, okay? There's no time.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.096
Are you still in Food Processing?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.972
Yeah, but I just cut and load the bars.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.016
I don't have access
to ingredients or anything.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.726
That's not what we need.

23:20.941 --> 23:21.942
Hey.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.278
Hey.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.536
Did you know that Layton's out?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.579
Yeah, they're using him as a detective.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.375
-There's a killer loose up here.
-That's what it was.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.672
Okay, look, we need you
to make contact with him.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.675
Josie, if they catch me--

23:46.758 --> 23:48.844
You could be sent back to the Tail.
I know.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.513
Honey...

23:52.264 --> 23:53.098
I get it.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.936
You're healthy now.
You live like a human being.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.523
The Tail needs you.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.987
We need you.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.452
- One Tail.
- One Tail.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.431
Thank you.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.772
Looks like Erik wasn't born
into the nice life he had up here.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.066
Yeah, I don't think
he had a very good childhood.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.737
You think he was capable
of something like this?

24:50.739 --> 24:51.740
Maybe.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.494
He sure wasted those rioters who tried
to grab me on the way to <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

24:57.662 --> 24:59.164
Was that when he saved your life?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.250
He joked about being cold-blooded.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.214
Born for the Freeze.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.926
Even if this was Erik, it's not our fault.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.762
- Nobody is saying that.
-Oh, I can just hear the track talk.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.307
Over the years, we learned that,
as a private soldier, Erik did things.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.352
That's what he's for.
Not psychotic murder.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.897
It can't come off
like we have sheltered a monster.

25:26.524 --> 25:30.153
Did Erik ever get aggressive
or weird with you?

25:36.785 --> 25:39.287
You guys really not get to see
the sun in the Tail?

25:39.871 --> 25:42.374
Most of us haven't seen the sun
in seven years.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.045
How's that make you feel,
living up here with everything you need?

25:47.128 --> 25:49.381
I mean, you guys didn't have tickets.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.095
Watch this.

26:09.859 --> 26:12.362
He asked about your relationship
with Erik.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.492
What about it?

26:18.952 --> 26:20.245
He tell you things?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.331
Ask you to keep secrets?

26:38.346 --> 26:39.431
LJ?

26:42.976 --> 26:45.395
No, I... I better not talk about it.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.078
Can we sit?

27:02.829 --> 27:04.706
I need to ask you about Erik and LJ.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.712
We'll expect to hear from you, okay?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.758
-Bye.
-Yeah.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.180
Miles.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.724
Oh, Christopher.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.979
Talk to Mom,
she'll understand.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.441
Whatever.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.490
-She's gonna be late.
-Mate, you're stressing me out doing that.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.787
Two minutes!

28:01.888 --> 28:02.847
Hey.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.641
-Oh, about time.
-Yeah.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.393
Santiago here is about
to have a heart attack.

28:07.018 --> 28:11.022
-We gotta move. Faster. Put these on.
-Okay. All right.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.610
-Three, two, one...
-There you go.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.365
Back to work.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.163
- Okay.
- Yeah, back to work.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.348
So, suddenly, we're searching
for a professional soldier with a pistol?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.100
Revolver, .38.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.102
That's comforting. Thank you.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.564
Hey, you sure it's not above?

28:52.647 --> 28:56.151
No, it's on this level. Over here.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.618
Anybody in there?

29:09.956 --> 29:10.832
Open up.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.926
He's on the move!

29:22.761 --> 29:24.012
He's up top!

29:25.472 --> 29:27.390
- Stop!
-Get off!

29:28.475 --> 29:29.893
-Go, go, go!
-Osweiller!

29:29.976 --> 29:31.311
Look out!

29:31.394 --> 29:33.563
-Osweiller, get him.
-I'm going up.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.816
-He's going back down the stairs.
- Okay, I'm on it.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.027
Go! Move!

29:40.361 --> 29:41.696
No!

29:42.280 --> 29:45.575
Oz! He's getting away! Go, go, go!

29:45.658 --> 29:47.368
-Hey, you bastard!

29:48.620 --> 29:49.621
Shit.

29:50.789 --> 29:55.168
Erik was only allowed two bags
on the train, and he brings records.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.130
They were his dad's.

30:00.256 --> 30:03.092
He hated his dad. He was white.

30:04.844 --> 30:05.929
Yeah, no shit.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.228
-Yo.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.357
It's a cat.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.442
Yeah, yeah, I know. It's just...

30:20.610 --> 30:23.780
-It's been a while.
-Erik saved him, too.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.366
Where'd he come from?

30:27.617 --> 30:30.161
Snowpeter is a master of disguise.

30:30.954 --> 30:31.955
"Snowpeter"?

30:33.665 --> 30:34.707
It's funny.

30:50.765 --> 30:55.019
<i>âª Though we've got to say goodbye âª</i>

30:55.103 --> 30:58.064
<i>âª For the summer âª</i>

30:58.606 --> 31:02.485
<i>âª Baby, I promise you this âª</i>

31:02.569 --> 31:05.572
<i>âª I'll send you all my love âª</i>

31:05.655 --> 31:07.198
I hear you eat people.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.451
We put a stop to that.

31:12.161 --> 31:12.996
Why?

31:14.664 --> 31:16.499
It keeps everyone up here scared of you.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.628
Like, I'd eat a dude
just to make everyone shit bricks

31:20.712 --> 31:22.213
like they do with the Tail.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.678
I know this song.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.390
So did Nikki GenÃªt.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.978
You know, you're a lot cooler
smashing the system

31:37.061 --> 31:38.688
than you are being Wilford's dick.

31:43.484 --> 31:47.196
Well... maybe we can do both.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.576
Erik ever tell you what he did with this?

31:55.747 --> 31:58.958
Never.
Erik practically raised LJ.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.251
It's going to come out, Lilah.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.878
-Zip it, Robert.
-We can't.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.509
Erik and LJ are close.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.138
"Close"?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.267
I can't say no to her.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.606
It's these times.
Morality's a moving target.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.575
-You open yet, Anton?
-Come in, Jinju. You made it.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.452
I've got Bess' gift right here.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.595
-No!

33:02.855 --> 33:04.565
-Please.
-Shut up. Shut up.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.692
A gun.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.236
An actual gun.

33:08.319 --> 33:12.240
Keep quiet, or this artifact
will blow your head off.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.619
Okay, we don't want any trouble.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.083
You know they hauled me up
out of the Tail

33:22.166 --> 33:23.793
to solve this against my will?

33:26.212 --> 33:28.047
I got no skin in this game.

33:28.631 --> 33:32.677
Erik might have been the murderer,
but removing body parts?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.637
That's how he screwed up.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.015
What do you mean, he screwed up?

33:37.932 --> 33:42.061
Well, castration's a crime of passion.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.440
A punishment that women lay down on men.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.942
That wasn't his idea, was it?

33:48.985 --> 33:52.113
He was probably just controlling
the victim for somebody else, right?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.911
So... are we playing your song?

34:01.205 --> 34:08.129
<i>âª Yes</i>
<i>It's gonna be a cold, lonely summer âª</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:12.091
<i>âª But I'll fill the emptiness âª</i>

34:12.175 --> 34:14.594
Shit, if I was
a blue-eyed Firstie girl,

34:14.677 --> 34:16.262
I'd be playing for time, too.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.766
Erik's going down
in a blaze of glory, right?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.643
He's not going to the Drawers.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.731
So, no one tells...

34:29.025 --> 34:31.402
and you finally got to feel something.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.991
When he held those men down for you.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.012
Chop, chop.

35:00.139 --> 35:02.183
Say you were even 2% right...

35:04.602 --> 35:05.812
Tailies need stuff.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.773
Always scrounging.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.026
Bet you'd like blueprints.

35:13.528 --> 35:17.824
How about guns?
Only First Class security gets those.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.742
Wow.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.537
You really are serious.

35:24.163 --> 35:27.416
But I bet a blue-eyed Firstie girl...

35:28.376 --> 35:32.004
might be able to get her hands
on one of those.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.717
And all I gotta do is tell nobody?

35:50.606 --> 35:52.859
He's somewhere in here.
We got Jackboots on the door.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.945
All right, folks,
we're clearing the market right now!

35:56.028 --> 35:57.071
She said this was coming.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.197
Who?

35:59.949 --> 36:00.992
Your girl?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.331
All right, folks, listen up!

36:07.415 --> 36:09.834
-Let's go right now!
- Get down. Now!

36:10.459 --> 36:11.919
Chip in. Chip in.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.009
Till!

36:21.095 --> 36:22.138
Move.

36:31.564 --> 36:35.359
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Down. Down. Down!

36:40.990 --> 36:42.241
They're in the subtrain!

36:45.286 --> 36:48.289
He's down below! One hostage!
Push down towards us!

36:49.707 --> 36:52.335
- Go. Go.
- Just tell me your name.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.920
What does that matter?

37:00.259 --> 37:01.469
Please.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.598
-They're coming.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.142
All right, flank.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.565
Turn around.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.694
-Turn around. Kneel down.
-No.

37:19.654 --> 37:20.529
Forward!

37:22.281 --> 37:25.201
-No, no! We have to hold.
-Pull back. He'll shoot her.

37:25.284 --> 37:28.621
Batons down!
Weapons on the deck! Now!

37:44.804 --> 37:46.055
Advance!

38:10.955 --> 38:12.873
Get me Melanie Cavill. It's urgent.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.437
He's dead.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.068
Erik's dead?

38:45.031 --> 38:46.699
- I got you, baby. I got you.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.617
Come on.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.619
Sweetie.

38:51.495 --> 38:55.541
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.262
I got you. Oh, honey.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.224
Sweetie.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.789
What's happening?

39:37.333 --> 39:39.752
Erik was a dog who did what he was told.

39:40.711 --> 39:44.924
And Lilah Junior told him to torture
and kill two Third Class men.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.010
What?

39:48.094 --> 39:50.346
-Your daughter's a murderer.
-How dare you?

39:50.429 --> 39:51.430
What?

39:54.683 --> 39:57.103
-No.
- No, LJ. Stop it.

39:57.186 --> 40:01.148
-No! Don't hurt her. No!

40:06.487 --> 40:09.407
Leave my baby alone.
You get off of her right now.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.470
Attention, all passengers.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.976
On behalf of Mr. Wilford,
I share this news.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.855
<i>The murderer who hid among us is dead,</i>

40:41.522 --> 40:44.942
<i>-and a second suspect is in custody.</i>

40:46.318 --> 40:50.990
Thanks to a successful investigation,
order has been restored.

40:51.824 --> 40:56.495
And Mr. Wilford assures you
justice will prevail.

40:57.913 --> 41:02.042
From all of us at Wilford Industries,
thank you.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.680
Now Mr. Wilford has to deliver justice.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.642
You in charge of that promise, too?

41:22.855 --> 41:24.690
How about I buy you a drink, Detective?

41:31.113 --> 41:33.365
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.327
A monument to human dominion

41:36.410 --> 41:37.745
-and resource control.

41:38.537 --> 41:41.999
Come on. Let's put
the politics down and celebrate a win.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.391
-Oh, shit. Sake.
-Mmm-hmm.

42:05.231 --> 42:09.818
What do you think
Mr. Wilford's big secret even was?

42:12.029 --> 42:14.323
I just want to go back
to the Tail, Melanie.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.285
You know I can't let you do that.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.247
You've seen too much.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.254
You figured it out, Layton.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.799
I know you did.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.929
A myth's a powerful thing.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.561
Pray you never know the weight of it.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.329
I'm sorry, Layton.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.266
There you go. Keep warm, brother.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.146
There you are, my mate.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.732
Okay. Nice one there.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.276
There you go, mate.

43:33.861 --> 43:37.698
Yoshimi, you're looking stunning
as always.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.619
Er, what the...

43:54.465 --> 43:55.507
Yes.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.677
Take over.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.055
-Hey, Josie.
- Where do you think you're going?

44:01.639 --> 44:02.973
Coming through, guys.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.933
Mind your head. Excuse me.

44:05.017 --> 44:08.020
-What is it?
-Looks like Astrid came through.

44:09.521 --> 44:11.273
-Yes.
- Yeah.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.630
-Keep him off-book.

44:35.839 --> 44:36.924
And, Doctor...

44:39.134 --> 44:41.679
Mr. Wilford does not want him damaged.
