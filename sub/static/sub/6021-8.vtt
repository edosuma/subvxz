00:11.444 --> 00:13.571
So Elaine, are you gonna sleep
with me or what?

00:13.747 --> 00:16.807
George, I just got off
a 23-hour plane ride.

00:16.983 --> 00:20.180
I'm too tired to even vomit
at the thought.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.753
Fine. I'll ask you again
when you're rested.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.219
I'm sure she'll come around.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.621
Yeah, I hope so, for your sake.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.055
I said, I was sorry.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.059
You can stuff your sorries in a sack.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.357
Would you please stop saying that?

00:32.531 --> 00:35.023
-What's up with you two?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.361
So how was the big trip?

00:36.536 --> 00:37.901
I don't wanna talk about it.

00:38.071 --> 00:41.871
-Well, what happened to your nose?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.067
Well, you gotta give me something.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.145
Come on, how was the wedding?
Was the bride radiant?

00:47.313 --> 00:48.746
She was.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.042
Till she found out Elaine slept
with the groom.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.947
Oh, that sounds juicy.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.886
Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom,
but I wanna hear all about it.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.721
You know, I didn't go to the bathroom
the entire time we were India.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.262
I can't believe we went all the way
to India for a wedding.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.469
-That's it. The wedding's off.
-But Sue Ellen--

01:12.639 --> 01:15.802
Elaine, you were my maid of honor
and you slept with my Pinter?

01:15.975 --> 01:18.102
No, no. It was years ago,
before you met him.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.111
And I gotta tell you,
it was very mechanical.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.272
I have never been so humiliated.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.941
Idiots. This is all your fault.

01:26.119 --> 01:30.180
-Me? Him. His fault. He betrayed me.
-George, I'm sorry.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.347
You can stuff your sorries
in a sack, mister.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.425
I don't know what that means.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.358
Nina, you have to decide right now.
Jerry or me.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.828
All right. Neither.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.523
What?

01:41.768 --> 01:44.328
-What are you doing here?
-A free trip to India.

01:44.504 --> 01:49.305
And by the way, you can take off those
boots. Everyone knows you're 5'6".

01:49.476 --> 01:52.639
-5'8". 5'7".
-See?

01:52.812 --> 01:56.373
See the way they are?
We're still best friends, right?

01:56.549 --> 01:59.814
No. And take that stupid thing
out of your nose.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.349
That's got to hurt.
I don't care where you're from.

02:04.524 --> 02:08.483
When is our flight back?
I gotta go to the bathroom.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.363
Hi.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.999
What happened last night?

02:21.174 --> 02:23.005
-Well, you were pretty loaded.
-I know.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.167
I woke up with this.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.506
Oh, hello, tetanus.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.944
George, I've used the bathroom.
It's fine.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.179
No, no, no. I can walk it off.

02:36.356 --> 02:39.450
It's 120 degrees in here.
I'll sweat it out.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.195
Hey.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.194
Are those Timberlands...

02:45.365 --> 02:46.855
...painted black?

02:47.033 --> 02:48.864
Is your nose pierced?

02:50.069 --> 02:52.503
-I should--
-Yeah. Sit down.

02:54.707 --> 02:58.234
Hello, Jerry.
I believe you know Nina.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.003
George, we need to talk.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.774
You've done a lot more than talk.
You betrayed me.

03:02.949 --> 03:06.043
All right, I admit it.
I slept with Nina, but that's all.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.619
That's all? That's everything.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.086
I don't know what the rest of it
is for, anyway.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.554
I'm really sorry.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.784
You can stuff your sorries in a sack,
mister.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.088
-Where'd you get that one?
-It's an expression.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.890
Hey.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.931
Look, we are gonna settle this
right now.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.835
I demand reparations.
I should get to sleep with Elaine.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.566
It's the only way to punish you.

03:30.743 --> 03:36.238
That doesn't punish me. It punishes
Elaine. And cruelly, I might add.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.482
Funny guy.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.952
Hey, monkeys. Knock it off.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.249
My best friend is trying
to get married here.

03:45.425 --> 03:48.724
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.226
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.523
Reparations.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.764
Would you grow up, George?
What is the difference?

03:55.935 --> 03:58.631
Nina slept with him, he slept with me,
I slept with Pinter.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.171
Nobody cares.
It's all ancient history.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.309
You slept with the groom?

04:22.795 --> 04:26.094
Thank you, FDR.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.463
-All right, now we're even, huh?
-I stuck a rock in there too.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.503
-I felt that.
-All right. Okay.

04:34.641 --> 04:35.699
All right, FDR.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.399
This wish is for all the marbles.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.772
You win, you get your wish,
I drop dead.

04:39.946 --> 04:44.645
I win, I don't drop dead and I get
100 percent anti-drop-dead protection.

04:44.817 --> 04:45.806
Forever.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.815
All right.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.024
Man.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.292
Come on. There's gotta be something
that'll change your mind.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.487
Something.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.628
What, you want my kidney?

05:14.947 --> 05:19.475
George knows that you slept with Nina.
That's why he was acting so weird.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.210
How did he find out?

05:21.387 --> 05:23.685
He schnapped me.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.588
You know you're not supposed to drink
while you're keeping a secret.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.760
-Is there anything else?
-I can't tell you.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.365
Here, drink this.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.058
Okay.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.406
I slept with the groom.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.169
-Pinter?
-He used to be called Peter.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.541
So who cares about that?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.616
Sue Ellen.

05:51.784 --> 05:55.220
If she knew, she'd call off
the whole wedding.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.186
Oh, nobody's calling off
any weddings.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.792
All right, it's time to go.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.056
Come on. Up.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.899
-You know what Jerry is in Indian?
-No. What?

06:10.069 --> 06:11.058
Jugdish.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.500
-Yes, Jugdish.
-Hey.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.205
What if I got my nose pierced?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.211
That would be pretty freaky.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.008
Yes. I think it's a fine idea.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.177
Well, good night.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.722
Good night, Jugdish.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.793
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.070
Hello, FDR.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.975
Yeah, I'll have a hot one.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.308
Everything on it.

06:56.482 --> 07:00.509
These things will kill you.
But so what?

07:00.686 --> 07:02.313
You're already gonna drop dead.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.512
Well, guess what, FDR?

07:03.689 --> 07:08.149
I made a wish on a shooting star last
night and I wished against your wish.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.488
That's funny. As it happens...

07:10.663 --> 07:14.622
...I saw the same shooting star
and I double-wished you to drop dead.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.790
Here's your change.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.005
All right, I'm triple-wishing.

07:20.973 --> 07:25.910
Yeah, fair enough.
I'm quadruple-wishing.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.011
All right. How do you like this?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.214
I like it a lot.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.853
Go.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.929
Oh, God, it's so hot.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.659
And what is that smell?

07:51.838 --> 07:53.999
I think it's the stench of death.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.742
George, you've been wearing
those boots since I met you.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.276
You're not gonna wear them
to the wedding, are you?

08:00.446 --> 08:01.811
No.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.411
I'm gonna wear black shoes.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.250
Oh, boy, there's Sue Ellen.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.355
She didn't want me at this wedding.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.754
But here I am with a bunch
of my idiot friends.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.689
This is gonna be great.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.387
Elaine? Oh.

08:18.564 --> 08:21.124
Oh, I am so happy to see you.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.098
-You are?
-Well, of course.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.568
No one else was even willing
to come to India.

08:26.739 --> 08:30.038
I mean, not even Pinter's parents
and they're Indian.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.677
Come on, Sue Ellen,
you don't wear a bra...

08:32.845 --> 08:34.904
...you're tall. We hate each other.

08:35.081 --> 08:38.517
Elaine, I know.
I know we've had our problems.

08:39.719 --> 08:44.019
But I want you to be my maid of honor
and my best friend.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.419
All right, I guess.

08:47.994 --> 08:52.260
Oh, this is my fiancÃ©.
Pinter, say hello.

08:52.431 --> 08:53.796
Hello.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.958
-Peter.
-Oh, no. It's Pinter.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.570
Does anyone wanna use
the bathroom?

08:59.739 --> 09:02.264
Oh, no, no. We're good.
Let's get going, all right.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.432
Watch it, funny man.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.578
Elaine, do you notice George
was acting strange the whole flight?

09:08.748 --> 09:12.707
No, what? Like what? Strange? No.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.883
Hey, look what they had
on the plane.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.579
Schnapps.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.928
Come on, come on.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.087
Yes. There's one.

09:26.265 --> 09:29.359
I wish I don't drop dead.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.230
Hey, shut up up there.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.840
-You shut up.
-Drop dead.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.839
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?

09:42.014 --> 09:44.448
Coach to India. The only way to go.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.711
Good one. Very funny.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.115
You're very funny, Jerry.

09:49.288 --> 09:50.812
That's what I always tell people.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.356
Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.753
-Are you all right?
-Of course I'm all right.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.329
I'm here with my girl. Nina.

09:59.966 --> 10:04.300
And what better way to pass the time
than gabbing with my best friend.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.701
With whom there are no secrets.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.363
Like this...

10:09.542 --> 10:12.443
-...since fourth grade.
-Didn't I beat you up in fourth grade?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.046
Funny guy.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.442
Right here.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.243
By the way...

10:18.417 --> 10:21.443
...you never said anything to George
about Jerry and me, did you?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.146
Oh, please, it's in the vault.

10:25.825 --> 10:29.522
Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.327
Hey, what time is it?

10:35.501 --> 10:37.230
You just asked me two minutes ago.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.500
-Hey, what time is it?
-I'm not wearing a watch.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.968
Is this tooth chipped?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.636
Yeah. How'd you do that?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.679
I have no idea.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.007
Watch this.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.926
Oh, God.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.358
So Jerry and Nina, huh?

11:08.801 --> 11:14.171
I'm not gonna tell you
any more things.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.375
You already told me everything.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.238
Okey-dokey.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.473
We had a deal, Newman.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.211
You were supposed to give me your
birthday wish. Now you've wasted it.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.116
Did l?

11:30.289 --> 11:33.725
Newman, I'm bored.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.919
-Does your girlfriend have to be here?
-Does yours?

11:39.231 --> 11:41.791
I'm just hanging out in this hellhole
because of George.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.559
Come on, Newman.
You gotta help me.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.533
What am I gonna do about FDR?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.866
Why don't you just make
another wish?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.065
And how am I gonna do that,
toots?

11:50.976 --> 11:52.910
What about a shooting star?

11:53.079 --> 11:58.540
-That's perfect.
-Beauty and brains.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.411
Oh, come on.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.281
You know he's a postman,
don't you?

12:06.692 --> 12:08.785
-Here's your plane ticket.
-What?

12:08.961 --> 12:14.024
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation
one week before her wedding in India.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.258
I'll show her.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.801
-By flying half way around the world?
-Spite never sleeps.

12:18.971 --> 12:22.270
Especially when you got a layover
in Sarajevo.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.133
-Hey.
-Here.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.800
You're going to India tomorrow.

12:25.978 --> 12:27.172
-For how long?
-Three days.

12:27.346 --> 12:31.510
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had
the best time with that Nina last night.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.120
I think I'm in love with her already.
You are a great friend.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.847
A great, great friend.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.753
Kramer. You wanna borrow
something? You wanna eat?

12:41.927 --> 12:44.157
-Wanna go to India?
-I can't.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.957
I'm gonna drop dead.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.531
Great. Nina could go, huh?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.133
Jerry, this is great.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.565
You and Elaine. Me and Nina.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.102
Kramer, I'll go with you.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.298
-I'm going to Newman's.
-Great, I love Newman.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.670
Jerry seem a little weird
when I mentioned Nina?

12:58.844 --> 13:02.177
Nina? Nina? Nope. Not weird.
No. Nina.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.146
-Why do you keep saying Nina?
-I don't know. Nina.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.251
Nina.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.978
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.091
I'll meet you down there.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.561
Cereal. Cereal.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.857
Peach schnapps.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.234
Come on, Lomez.
We're gonna be late for the movie.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.968
You see, my dear,
all certified mail is registered...

13:31.143 --> 13:35.512
...but registered mail
is not necessarily certified.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.775
I could listen to you
talk about mail all day.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.578
Anything you wish.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.950
I'll tell you a little secret
about zip codes.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.057
They're meaningless.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.225
Newman.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.296
Lomez, I'm leaving.

14:06.679 --> 14:11.548
Make a wish, Newman. We've gotta
get back to work in three hours.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.776
Newman. Wait.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.012
Kramer. I'm with people.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.850
Yeah, yeah.
And thanks for inviting me.

14:19.024 --> 14:24.656
I did invite you. Your invitation
must have gotten lost in the mail.

14:28.634 --> 14:32.297
Look, Newman, I need your wish
to protect me from FDR.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.167
No. I'm on an unbelievable
birthday-wish hot streak.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.104
My last five birthday wishes
came true.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.767
Come on. Look, I'll give you
my next birthday wish.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.607
Your next 50 wishes.

14:42.781 --> 14:43.941
Forty-eight.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.447
-Forty-nine.
-Done.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.607
-Sucker.
-Sucker.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.717
All right, I'm back, savages, back.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.722
I haven't made my wish yet.

15:04.036 --> 15:07.301
Well, this Mischke mishmash
is just getting worse.

15:07.473 --> 15:11.170
I talked to the groom's parents and it is
obvious that they don't want me to go.

15:11.343 --> 15:14.141
The reason she sent me an
invitation is so I'd send a gift.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.577
-Jerry.
-You know, coffee grinder's nice...

15:16.749 --> 15:20.583
...or a coffee maker. Everyone likes
coffee. Maybe you should go get--

15:20.753 --> 15:22.948
Oh, hi.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.645
Hi.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.347
-I should--
-Sure.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.051
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.990
Who else you got back there?

15:36.168 --> 15:38.363
There was an awkward moment
in the conversation.

15:38.537 --> 15:39.526
Never happened before.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.572
You slept with Nina.
What are you gonna tell George?

15:42.741 --> 15:44.174
Nothing. And neither will you.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.141
George can never know about this.
It'll crush him.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.338
All right, I'll put it in the vault.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.608
No good. Too many people
know the combination.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.876
What combination?

15:55.387 --> 15:58.288
Don't be ridiculous.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.324
Oh, my God, this drawer
is filled with Froot Loops.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.687
So what?

16:02.861 --> 16:04.556
And milk.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.224
Oh, jeez.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.926
Hello?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.683
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.340
Please.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.247
Call us Usha and Zubin.

16:28.420 --> 16:31.082
-Well, Usha.
-I'm Zubin.

16:31.256 --> 16:34.282
Anyway, your son is marrying
my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke--

16:34.460 --> 16:36.655
You're not going to the wedding,
are you?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.558
-Well.
-Don't go.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.723
India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.097
You know, it's the only country
that still has the plague.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.000
I mean, the plague. Please.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.766
Here's the registry.

16:50.943 --> 16:54.538
Send her a gift and be glad
you did not have to go.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.682
Right. Don't go. Send a gift?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.784
I think I understand.

16:59.952 --> 17:04.252
If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go
to the bathroom the entire trip.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.220
That's fantastic.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.952
And I'm not so crazy
about Manhattan either.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.431
You were gonna tell me
all about George.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.867
When you see him tomorrow night
tell him that the waiter liked him.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.267
Really?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.998
Believe me.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.439
I forgot how much fun it is
hanging out with you.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.603
I know. You know,
we never had a bad conversation.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.273
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably
the reason we never fooled around.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.885
Yeah.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.951
Probably the reason.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.229
Are you dense?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.736
I said, I wanted you to drop dead.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.299
Now, drop dead.

18:02.314 --> 18:03.838
I knew it. Stupid Jerry.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.115
I know what I'm saying.
No way FDR wants you to drop dead.

18:09.288 --> 18:12.815
-But you have--
-Just go back and ask him again.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.188
That's right. My birthday wish
was that you drop dead.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.351
Well, why?

18:18.530 --> 18:19.997
I have my reasons.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.991
Wait, if you make a birthday wish
out loud, it doesn't come true.

18:24.169 --> 18:27.627
That's just a silly superstition.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.542
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.410
-FDR?
-Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski.

18:38.584 --> 18:39.915
I go to his birthday party...

18:40.085 --> 18:43.350
...and just before he blew out
his candles, he gives me this look.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.989
-Stink eye?
-Crook eye?

18:45.157 --> 18:47.648
Evil eye.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.186
Everybody's a little cranky
on their birthday.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.351
Oh, it's a bad day.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.124
Everyone's over. You're thinking:
"These are my friends?"

18:54.299 --> 18:55.789
Everyday is my birthday.

18:57.169 --> 19:01.606
Well, I can't have this hanging
over my head. It's bad mojo.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.536
Hi.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.871
You're not gonna believe
what I got in the mail.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.345
Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's
wedding.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.111
At least the wedding gown
will give her some support.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.514
Not the point.

19:15.687 --> 19:19.589
The wedding is in one week.
I got this today.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.158
-So you think it's a non-vite.
-It's an un-vitation.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.360
-Hey, are you getting taller?
-Timberlands.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.633
Hey, look at this. Pinter Ranawat?

19:30.802 --> 19:33.396
Wonder if he's related to the guy
I dated Peter Ranawat.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.040
It's probably like Smith over there.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.066
-Jerry, would you make the call?
-What call?

19:39.244 --> 19:41.439
He wants me to set him up
with Nina Stengle.

19:41.613 --> 19:45.743
Oh, the great conversation girl.
The one you think can replace me.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.681
I was kidding when I said that.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.945
Told me the same thing.

19:49.121 --> 19:52.284
-Nina, hi, it's Jerry.
-You're sure you never slept with her?

19:53.091 --> 19:55.218
-Perfect.
-Hey, how about my friend George...

19:55.394 --> 19:57.225
...quite a guy, huh?

19:57.629 --> 19:59.597
Something's not sitting right.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.924
-I'll have the clams casino.
-Get out.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.090
Chef recommends.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.605
-Do you think she likes me?
-Sure.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.071
How come nothing ever happened
with you and Nina?

20:10.242 --> 20:12.142
Is there a problem with her?
Is she a man?

20:12.311 --> 20:14.302
Are you?

20:14.479 --> 20:15.741
Then what's the reason?

20:15.914 --> 20:19.315
We were too compatible. Our
conversations were so engrossing.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.884
-How engrossing?
-If we had a problem with Elaine...

20:22.054 --> 20:24.614
...we could bring in Nina
and not lose a step.

20:26.825 --> 20:30.261
You don't have a replacement
lined up for me, do you?

20:33.498 --> 20:34.487
Like I was saying...

20:34.666 --> 20:37.362
...I couldn't make the transition
from conversation to sex.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.970
There were no awkward pauses.
I need an awkward pause.

20:40.138 --> 20:42.629
I'm all awkward pauses.
Fix me up with her.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.402
Well, wait a minute.
Nina just saw me in my Timberlands.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.512
I have to wear them
every time I see her.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.148
-Why?
-In any other shoe, I lose 2 inches.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.410
I can't have a drop-down.
We're eye to eye. I can't go eye to chin.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.645
So you're gonna wear them
no matter what?

20:56.822 --> 21:00.053
In every situation.
No matter how silly I look.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.352
-Tastes a little funky.
-I'm sure it's fine.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.328
Go on, make a wish,
make a wish.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.746
This is the kind of day that almost
makes you feel good to be alive.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.745
-New Timberlands?
-Yeah, and a whole new me.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.856
-I'm up 2 inches on these babies.
-Really?

21:33.025 --> 21:35.186
5'8". 5'7".

21:36.028 --> 21:37.290
-Jerry.
-Nina.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.622
-Hi.
-It's been years.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.264
-Yeah.
-George, this is Nina.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.798
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.503
India?

21:52.944 --> 21:53.933
Yeah, right.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.239
I'm going to India.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.915
And they call it the World Wide Web.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.424
You can e-mail anyone.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.222
What are you, a scientist?

22:12.297 --> 22:13.696
Gotta go.

22:14.132 --> 22:17.033
-It was great talking.
-Great talking to you.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.261
What the hell is e-mail?

22:20.772 --> 22:22.467
-How was the date?
-Pretty good.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.040
I think she might be the one.

22:26.778 --> 22:28.939
-Oh, French fries.
-George.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.174
Baked potato. Sorry.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.115
Yeah, you stuff your sorries
in a sack, mister.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.619
Oh, hey, hey. Yeah. Check it out.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.951
Man, it's packing tight.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.460
Why are you bringing
snowballs in here?

22:43.628 --> 22:46.028
I need some water.
Ice it up, nice and hard.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.665
Then when you throw it:

22:47.833 --> 22:49.801
Oh, look, there's my friend FDR.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.163
I'm gonna nail him
in the back of the head.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.237
It's gonna be great.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.113
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.044
Let's go someplace else.
Okay, Peter?

23:15.293 --> 23:16.282
Hey, how you doing?

23:16.461 --> 23:18.929
Oh, hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm moving in.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.361
Saw your name on the buzzer.
You must be Kessler.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.626
No, actually, it's Kramer.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.994
-You need any help or--?
-No, thanks.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.695
I ordered a pizza, you want some?

23:27.873 --> 23:30.467
No, no, no. I couldn't impose.

23:30.642 --> 23:31.666
Why not?

23:31.843 --> 23:34.277
We're neighbors.
What's mine is yours.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.515
Really?

23:40.152 --> 23:41.676
<i>Good night, Jugdish.</i>
