I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.754
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-What you've done here is
extraordinary.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.424
You've brought the entire
community together.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.592
You did that.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.494
Don't think
the church hasn't noticed.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.396
Tara, can you deposit

00:28.429 --> 00:30.064
this check first thing
tomorrow morning, please?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.999
Since when do we get
six-figure checks?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.401
(groans)

00:36.937 --> 00:38.339
Where's Verity?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.574
She forgot some book
over at Russ and Colleen's.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.943
-You're in charge.
-MARCUS: You let

00:42.976 --> 00:44.445
a demon into your head, Tomas.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.681
Evil leaves a mark.
It stains.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.350
Now every thought
that you have,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.385
every decision
that you make is compromised.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.255
TOMAS: Though war break out
against me, I will be confident.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.957
Hey, kiddo.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.259
MARCUS:
St. Michael...

00:58.292 --> 00:59.760
Pray for us.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.962
-St. Joseph...
-Pray for us.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.165
-MARCUS: St. Rafael...
-Pray for us.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.705
Oh, Tomas...

01:11.739 --> 01:13.707
Tomas?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.743
(panting)

01:17.845 --> 01:19.313
(pants)

01:19.347 --> 01:21.349
(grunts)

01:27.020 --> 01:28.889
(sighs, grunts)

01:28.922 --> 01:31.792
(panting)

01:31.825 --> 01:34.895
Tomas,
I need you to wake up!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.497
MARCUS:
Angels and archangels...

01:36.530 --> 01:37.931
-TOMAS: Pray for us.
-MARCUS: St. Joseph...

01:37.965 --> 01:39.933
-Pray for us.
-(holy water hissing)

01:39.967 --> 01:41.135
-St. Gabriel...
-Pray for us.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.403
-St. Raphael...
-Pray for us.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.273
MARCUS:
Tomas, fight it.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.108
No.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.244
MARCUS:
Fight it!

01:50.278 --> 01:52.446
The light of God surrounds us.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.947
(panting)

01:53.981 --> 01:56.750
The love of God informs us.

01:56.784 --> 02:00.288
The power of God protects us.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.857
Tomas.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.893
(panting)

02:13.367 --> 02:15.669
MARCUS:
What are you doing, Tomas?

02:22.042 --> 02:25.179
You promised you would help me.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.814
You can't leave me here.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.317
No.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.685
(holy water hissing)

02:31.719 --> 02:35.189
This is not right.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.624
No.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.859
(Tomas panting)

02:38.892 --> 02:41.562
-You're not going anywhere.
-(groans)

02:42.830 --> 02:44.898
-(door rumbles open)
-(panting)

02:51.672 --> 02:53.674
(speaking Spanish)

02:55.676 --> 02:57.678
(panting)

03:09.790 --> 03:11.259
(woman speaks quietly)

03:11.292 --> 03:14.228
Bishop!
There you are.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.196
Tara?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.402
I-I'm...
I'm not supposed to be here.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.771
(giggles) You said
the same thing last year

03:23.804 --> 03:26.340
when they offered you
this promotion, remember?

03:26.374 --> 03:28.776
You wanted to run off
and become an exorcist. (laughs)

03:28.809 --> 03:31.078
No, no, no.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.046
No, that's not how it happened.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.449
Imagine all the things
you would have lost.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.018
You're the youngest bishop
in 20 years.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.854
Look at this church you built.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.023
All the people
that depend on you.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.459
This is where you belong.

03:45.493 --> 03:49.863
Tomas,
think of the congregation.

03:49.897 --> 03:56.637
* Who abide in His shadow
for life *

03:56.670 --> 04:01.375
* Say to the Lord, "My refuge

04:01.409 --> 04:07.114
* My rock in whom I trust"

04:07.147 --> 04:10.651
* And He will raise you up

04:10.684 --> 04:13.821
* On eagle's wings...

04:13.854 --> 04:15.856
(birds squawking)

04:44.685 --> 04:47.555
(engine starts, revs)

04:57.998 --> 05:00.000
(engine revving)

05:04.505 --> 05:08.208
Keane? Marcus Keane?

05:08.241 --> 05:09.543
Father Ortega?

05:09.577 --> 05:12.312
The Vatican is not your enemy.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.148
We're here to talk.
Just to talk.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.719
If you are in trouble,
we can help.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.927
(grunts)

05:28.195 --> 05:30.097
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
(birds squawking)

06:05.899 --> 06:09.269
*

06:40.000 --> 06:42.002
*

07:07.861 --> 07:09.863
Is anybody up there?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.967
Harper?

07:44.632 --> 07:47.601
-ANDY: Sit down, Rose.
-(blow strikes, body thuds)

07:47.635 --> 07:49.169
VERITY:
Dad, please.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.471
-ROSE: Andy, no. Stop!
-(Verity screams)

07:51.505 --> 07:54.441
(grunts, groans)

07:54.474 --> 07:55.943
Leave her alone.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
(Rose panting)

07:58.011 --> 08:00.047
I'm sorry, Rose,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.716
but I'm not gonna let you
break up my family.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.390
See?

08:10.423 --> 08:12.826
She's alive.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.801
She's fine.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.070
Everybody's fine.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.173
(Rose grunts, glass breaks)

08:26.206 --> 08:28.742
(Rose panting, grunting)

08:28.776 --> 08:30.377
(clattering)

08:32.179 --> 08:33.647
(Rose gasps)

08:33.681 --> 08:35.583
(yells)

08:45.125 --> 08:47.628
Rose?

08:52.432 --> 08:54.434
(Marcus panting)

09:22.462 --> 09:24.497
(gasps, grunts)

09:32.405 --> 09:34.207
(Rose yelling)

09:34.241 --> 09:36.409
(Andy groans)

09:38.912 --> 09:40.213
(Rose grunts)

09:40.247 --> 09:42.249
(groans, pants)

09:43.917 --> 09:47.454
Rose. Please...

09:47.487 --> 09:50.557
(Andy panting)

09:50.590 --> 09:52.860
NICOLE:
Andy...

09:54.161 --> 09:55.362
...now!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.131
(Rose grunts)

10:15.683 --> 10:17.685
(seagull keening)

10:23.490 --> 10:25.492
(car door opens)

10:28.228 --> 10:30.964
-So, where are we going?
-Home. Where else would we go?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.633
Caleb!

10:33.667 --> 10:35.035
ANDY:
All right, I'm closing the door.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.704
-SHELBY: Caleb!
-(car door closes)

10:36.737 --> 10:38.806
ANDY:
Buckle up, you guys.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.979
Oh, it's so good to see you.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.381
You all right?

10:48.415 --> 10:51.852
I know I look terrible,
but, um...

10:51.885 --> 10:55.122
I'm doing much better,
thanks to Marcus and Tomas.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.991
And, um...

10:58.025 --> 11:00.560
God.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.132
Well, Andy,
what are you doing here?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.400
I'm here to take you guys home.
Get in the car.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.840
Why-why didn't Rose come
to get us?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.877
'Cause I got a lot
to apologize for...

11:16.910 --> 11:19.446
in person.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.915
And I wanted to tell you--

11:21.949 --> 11:24.718
tell all of you--

11:24.752 --> 11:26.686
this is over.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.688
Okay?

11:28.722 --> 11:32.860
I'm not gonna hurt
anyone anymore.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.729
It's time to put this family
back together.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.168
Come on, get in the car, Shelby.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.170
(engine starts)

11:43.203 --> 11:45.205
(choir singing indistinct hymn)

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
(shuddering breathing)

11:52.045 --> 11:54.782
* In the palm

11:54.815 --> 11:58.752
* Of His hand

12:00.954 --> 12:04.591
* You need not fear

12:04.624 --> 12:06.894
* The terror of the night

12:06.927 --> 12:09.062
* Nor the arrow

12:09.096 --> 12:12.732
-* That flies by day
-WOMAN: Monsignor Tomas.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.735
* Though thousands

12:15.769 --> 12:18.571
* Fall about you

12:18.605 --> 12:20.140
* Near you

12:20.173 --> 12:24.611
* It shall not come

12:24.644 --> 12:26.613
* And He will raise you up

12:26.646 --> 12:30.050
* On eagle's wings

12:30.083 --> 12:32.419
* Bear you on

12:32.452 --> 12:35.488
* The breath of dawn

12:35.522 --> 12:38.058
* Make you to shine

12:38.091 --> 12:40.928
* Like the sun

12:40.961 --> 12:42.896
* And hold you

12:42.930 --> 12:46.766
* In the palm...

12:51.371 --> 12:55.242
* Of His hand.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.177
In the name of the Father,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.779
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.315
The Lord be with you.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.684
CONGREGATION:
And also with you.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.719
TOMAS:
Please be seated.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.803
(emergency brake sets)

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
(gears shift)

13:29.576 --> 13:32.345
(engine stops)

13:34.414 --> 13:37.484
SHELBY:
Andy, what are we doing here?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.927
What was it like?

13:49.696 --> 13:52.532
It was... hell.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.668
Having to sit and...

13:55.702 --> 13:58.471
watch while that thing...

13:58.505 --> 14:01.574
hurt my family.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.610
The people I love.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.181
The demon...

14:08.215 --> 14:10.250
it's gone, right?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.285
Hmm.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.056
(clears throat)

14:19.126 --> 14:21.461
What do you think, Harper?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.066
I think you killed my mom.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.736
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.773
But listen, did you ever think
that maybe your mom

14:33.806 --> 14:35.642
was the evil one?

14:37.544 --> 14:41.381
And that's why God brought her
to me?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.718
You can be mad all you want,

14:45.752 --> 14:48.922
but if you think about it,

14:48.956 --> 14:51.224
God killed your mom.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.793
Not me.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.734
Andy, Andy...

15:01.768 --> 15:05.138
Whatever's going on with you,
we can help you, all right?

15:05.172 --> 15:07.207
We can get you the help
you need.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.942
ANDY:
Time to go.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.779
You guys.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.714
It's gonna be fun.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.084
(quietly): Lock your doors.
Lock your doors, quick.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.288
(key fob beeps, locks click)

15:21.321 --> 15:23.823
Caleb, give me your cane.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.892
-Why? -Caleb, give me
your cane right now!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.795
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.264
-Shelby...
-Don't watch.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.705
ANDY:
Shelby, come on out.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.909
-(Shelby groans)
-HARPER: Shelby!

15:42.942 --> 15:44.744
(thud, Shelby screams)

15:44.777 --> 15:46.779
-What's going on?
-(Harper screams)

15:46.813 --> 15:48.781
-Harper?
-HARPER: Let me go!

15:48.815 --> 15:50.817
Harper? Harper!

15:50.850 --> 15:52.519
-Harper!
-(Harper screams)

15:52.552 --> 15:54.554
(windshield wipers drumming)

15:57.124 --> 16:00.160
Harper?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.729
(windshield wipers drumming)

16:05.132 --> 16:07.734
Shelby?

16:10.637 --> 16:13.806
Okay. Okay.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.842
(shuddering breathing)

16:22.149 --> 16:25.052
I'm not scared of you!

16:25.085 --> 16:28.088
I'm not!

16:30.090 --> 16:32.092
(Andy laughing)

16:44.071 --> 16:46.273
(Andy laughing)

16:52.679 --> 16:54.581
-Come on.
-(laughing grows louder)

16:54.614 --> 16:57.384
Come on.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.886
(Caleb grunts)

16:59.919 --> 17:02.021
Careful.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.640
-(horse neighs)
-(Marcus grunts)

17:35.988 --> 17:38.658
I got you. I got you.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.762
I got you.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.764
-(Caleb grunts)
-(gasps)

18:06.686 --> 18:08.955
(both crying)

18:08.988 --> 18:11.057
He's gonna kill us.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.293
When he comes back.

18:13.326 --> 18:17.096
Verity, you've been in bad
situations before.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.598
I read your file.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.301
I know what they did to you.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.069
So?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.637
I also know that every time
they tied you up,

18:24.671 --> 18:26.038
you managed to free yourself.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.976
Yeah.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.279
You're no victim, are you?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.156
(Verity grunts)

18:43.190 --> 18:45.057
(Andy clears throat)

18:49.028 --> 18:51.164
V, Rose.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.632
(sighing):
Thank God.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.901
-God?
-(Shelby grunts)

18:58.238 --> 19:00.106
They're alive because of me.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.541
(Shelby grunts)

19:04.977 --> 19:07.780
(groans)

19:07.814 --> 19:09.616
(Andy grunts)

19:09.649 --> 19:11.884
They're alive...

19:11.918 --> 19:15.688
because of me, Shelby.

19:15.722 --> 19:19.058
Do we wait for Truck?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.863
Do this right, as a family?

19:23.896 --> 19:28.034
Or... or...

19:28.067 --> 19:29.902
uh...

19:29.936 --> 19:34.307
Or do we cut our losses...
(sniffs)

19:34.341 --> 19:36.743
...and get this party started?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.546
(panting)

19:39.579 --> 19:41.581
(sighs)

19:42.949 --> 19:45.285
Mi tío!

19:47.387 --> 19:50.156
Luis? Luis.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.058
Ah.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.326
Oh.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.262
(Tomas speaks Spanish)

19:58.265 --> 19:59.432
You're coming to my party,
right?

19:59.466 --> 20:00.800
Mom said you'd be there.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.206
I would not miss it
for the world.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.242
You have a visitor, Tomas.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.614
Casey.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.082
Hi, Father.

20:16.115 --> 20:19.386
Or I guess I should call you
Bishop, now.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.388
TARA: Luis, let's give them
some privacy.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.590
We've got some comics
in the new library.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.024
Bye, Uncle Tomas.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.459
See you on Saturday.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.128
Uh, bye, buddy. Bye.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.630
Bye.

20:33.666 --> 20:37.437
I... I thought you left Chicago.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.440
I need your help.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.943
And my mom said that I should
come talk to you.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.513
You know how she's
kind of old school.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.919
I think there's something wrong
with me.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.289
But we saved you.

20:58.491 --> 21:02.329
Do you ever feel like you're not
in control of your own body?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.565
Yes.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.969
I have these crazy,
scary dreams, and...

21:10.002 --> 21:13.506
Sometimes I wake up and
I don't even know where I am.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.446
You're not Casey Rance.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.848
And none of this is real.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.852
(demonic voice): You ought
to be careful, Father.

21:25.885 --> 21:29.356
You made a vow
to serve your parish.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.091
I left Chicago for a reason.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.627
(normal voice):
Think of all the people

21:34.661 --> 21:37.430
you left behind.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.633
They bulldozed St. Anthony's,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.902
and you don't even care.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.173
That is not true.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.879
All those people
you abandoned,

21:52.912 --> 21:55.448
just so you could feel special.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.918
Tell me, Tomas...

22:01.388 --> 22:03.423
(demonic voice):
...do you feel special yet?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.897
(panting)

22:11.898 --> 22:14.801
What do you think?

22:14.834 --> 22:19.205
Should we finish the job
that Truck started?

22:19.238 --> 22:22.141
It wasn't Truck.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.111
-It wasn't Truck that did this?
-(gasps)

22:28.247 --> 22:29.416
(chokes)

22:29.449 --> 22:33.386
(echoing booms)

22:33.420 --> 22:35.087
Take your hands off her!

22:35.121 --> 22:37.890
-Don't touch me.
-SHELBY: Leave her alone!

22:37.924 --> 22:39.592
Let her go!

22:39.626 --> 22:42.261
(coughing)

22:42.294 --> 22:44.464
ANDY (softly):
Ooh, Shelby.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.972
Oh.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.680
Doesn't look so good.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.215
(screaming)

23:04.917 --> 23:06.953
(panting)

23:06.986 --> 23:09.722
You should get that looked at.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.591
You think you're clever?

23:13.259 --> 23:15.695
I was onto your ass
from the start.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.929
(whispers):
Yeah.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.131
You were, weren't you?

23:21.300 --> 23:24.036
*

23:24.070 --> 23:26.473
(distant, eerie screams)

23:33.179 --> 23:34.814
God!

23:34.847 --> 23:36.716
You're smart.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.951
You were onto me.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.887
Didn't do you much good,
though, did it?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.924
Lamb's blood only protects you
from God's wrath...

23:46.292 --> 23:48.461
...not mine.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.499
He's so much worse than me.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.934
Egyptian parents...

23:54.967 --> 23:58.337
they awoke the next morning...

23:58.370 --> 24:01.440
to find their babies dead
in their cradles,

24:01.474 --> 24:03.442
their breath stolen

24:03.476 --> 24:05.244
by a vengeful creator.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.446
Your God...

24:07.480 --> 24:10.416
(snarling):
your God...

24:10.449 --> 24:14.320
has taken far more children
than I ever will.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.992
You know what?
I changed my mind.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.764
You're gonna go last.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.465
Yay.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.370
(whispers):
Which means...

24:31.403 --> 24:33.405
which means...

24:35.575 --> 24:38.110
...which means, which means,

24:38.144 --> 24:40.647
which means...

24:40.680 --> 24:42.348
Caleb.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.350
What do you say?

24:44.383 --> 24:47.386
You and me, just like old times.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.522
Right?

24:49.556 --> 24:52.825
BOTH:
One.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.527
Two.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.695
(wood creaking)

24:55.728 --> 24:56.963
CALEB:
Three.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.298
BOTH:
Four.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.901
CALEB:
Five.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.837
ANDY:
This is gonna be a lot of work.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.974
-But I like that work.
-(trembling breaths)

25:08.007 --> 25:10.743
ROSE:
Coward.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.112
You're so weak.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.586
Weak?

25:19.619 --> 25:23.522
I stabbed you with a pitchfork.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.926
You're losing blood.

25:26.959 --> 25:30.162
You're losing time.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.932
You don't have the strength
to take us.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.233
You don't get a vote, Rose.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.501
You're not a part
of this family.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.869
You're not a part of any family.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.205
You're a nothing.
You're a bonus.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.308
Then what are you waiting for?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.881
ANDY: Eyes up at the front
of the class, kids.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.957
Watch and learn.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.764
*

26:11.971 --> 26:13.472
Count.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.207
Go to hell.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.443
Oh...
(clicking tongue)

26:22.749 --> 26:24.651
(whispers):
He put her on the well.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.390
Andy... please,
I know you can fight it.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.326
I got to do everything
around here.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.695
One.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.500
Two.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.704
Three.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.679
Four, five, six.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.117
Maybe you'll be accepted,

26:58.150 --> 27:00.319
be a part of this family.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.059
Seven.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.401
Eight.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.472
Nine.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.414
Ten.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
Congratulations.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.028
Andy.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.199
(screams)

27:47.233 --> 27:48.534
(gasps)

27:50.536 --> 27:52.571
(panting)

27:55.842 --> 27:58.077
Welcome to the family.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.228
*

28:38.785 --> 28:41.020
(Verity breathing quickly)

28:41.053 --> 28:42.755
(soft footsteps approaching)

28:42.789 --> 28:44.791
Someone's coming.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.392
(panting)

28:48.627 --> 28:51.297
You know what?

28:51.330 --> 28:54.166
I decided Truck's gonna go last.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.736
-You son of a bitch.
-ANDY: Language.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.975
Our Father, who art in heaven...

29:03.009 --> 29:05.945
(panting):
hallowed be Thy name.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.780
Thy kingdom come,

29:07.814 --> 29:10.416
ANDY/SHELBY:
Thy will be done...

29:10.449 --> 29:12.451
(panting)

29:12.484 --> 29:15.121
...on earth, as it is in heaven.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.057
Verity, run!

29:18.090 --> 29:20.459
SHELBY:
Get out! Get out of here! Go!

29:20.492 --> 29:22.728
(grunts)

29:22.761 --> 29:25.865
*

29:32.939 --> 29:34.440
ANDY:
Verity!

29:36.642 --> 29:38.210
ANDY:
Verity!

29:39.678 --> 29:42.048
(whimpering)

29:59.298 --> 30:01.400
This is a fantasy.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.604
What's wrong
with a little fantasy?

30:05.637 --> 30:08.774
Think about
what I'm offering you.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.144
You could have your life back.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.813
Wash away your sins.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.451
My sins are my own,
and I take full responsibility

30:19.485 --> 30:21.653
for everything I've done.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.892
Look at the path you're on.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.995
There's a rot in your soul,

30:29.028 --> 30:31.697
and it's damaging
everyone around you.

30:33.365 --> 30:37.469
How long until you
get them all killed?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.038
Your partner.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.706
Your family.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.975
Your friends.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.344
Rose is already dead.

30:49.181 --> 30:53.085
How long before you destroy
everything you touch?

31:02.794 --> 31:04.630
(panting)

31:08.300 --> 31:09.568
(creaking)

31:09.601 --> 31:11.737
(panting rapidly)

31:16.542 --> 31:18.810
(relieved sigh)
Father Marcus.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.880
-MARCUS: Are you all right?
-(panting)

31:23.249 --> 31:25.284
He went after Verity.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.718
Okay.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.057
Where's Rose?

31:31.090 --> 31:33.259
He killed her.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.961
Are you sure?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.929
(weakly):
I-In the well.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.400
SHELBY:
I got this.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.070
You need to go after V.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.341
Just get them off the island.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.613
-You okay?
-Okay.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.817
(whimpering)

31:58.850 --> 32:00.019
ANDY:
Verity!

32:10.129 --> 32:11.630
Verity?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.379
Verity!

32:33.185 --> 32:35.154
Where are you!?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.526
Verity.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.836
Come on, let's go.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.871
Slowly, slowly.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.740
(grunting)

33:03.082 --> 33:04.616
Harper?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.885
Come on, we got to go.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.055
-(panting)
-Harper?

33:16.495 --> 33:18.030
Rose?

33:22.034 --> 33:25.071
Rose, are you there?

33:25.104 --> 33:28.907
Harper. Harper.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.920
-HARPER: Okay.
-SHELBY: Rose!

33:41.953 --> 33:43.222
-I'll go get the ropes.
-Rose.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.656
Go. Go, Harper.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.192
We're gonna get you out!

33:46.225 --> 33:47.493
You've got to get out of here.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.195
Please. Run. Run.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.363
Don't worry about me, please.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.432
CALEB:
Yeah, that's not happening.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.767
Okay. Okay, okay.

33:57.636 --> 33:58.904
HARPER:
We're going with you, Rose.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.572
(grunting)

34:00.606 --> 34:03.109
(groaning)

34:10.549 --> 34:12.418
(gasping)

34:20.759 --> 34:22.027
(screams)

34:22.060 --> 34:24.430
(hissing)

34:24.463 --> 34:28.334
SHELBY: Just hold on
and let us pull, okay?

34:31.137 --> 34:34.440
You have no idea who I am.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.042
How long

34:37.075 --> 34:40.312
I've been doing this.

34:40.346 --> 34:43.882
What is it
you priests like to say?

34:43.915 --> 34:47.153
(Marcus' voice):
With ritual and repetition.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.654
The way it's been done

34:48.687 --> 34:51.623
for hundreds of years.

34:51.657 --> 34:54.660
(normal voice):
The power is in the repetition.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.462
And I have

34:56.495 --> 34:58.664
so much power.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.766
All those families.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.100
All those children.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.069
All those grieving parents.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.572
You deceive them.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.774
No.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.043
I give them what they want.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.616
First Mexican Pope?

35:17.649 --> 35:21.019
I can give you that, Tomasito.

35:21.052 --> 35:24.823
Just ask.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.359
Maybe.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.831
Maybe I wanted that
a long time ago

35:32.864 --> 35:35.033
when I was a very different man.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.643
Do you really want to know
what I want?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.181
(whispering):
I want to watch you die,

35:49.215 --> 35:51.250
you son of a bitch.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.388
All right, hold on.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.724
-We're gonna pull you out.
-Come on.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.793
(grunting)

36:01.827 --> 36:03.795
(grunts)

36:03.829 --> 36:06.198
That's it.

Come on, pull!

36:21.112 --> 36:22.281

-Pull!

36:25.351 --> 36:26.852
Come on.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.053

36:28.086 --> 36:29.555

36:29.588 --> 36:31.056
HARPER:
Come on.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.861
Caleb... Caleb, we got her!

36:35.894 --> 36:38.196
-ROSE: Harper...
-SHELBY: Caleb.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.332
(panting)

36:40.366 --> 36:42.568
Rose!

36:43.902 --> 36:47.439
Caleb, Caleb.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.908
Where's Verity?

36:49.941 --> 36:51.877
Marcus got her.

36:51.910 --> 36:55.547
Harper, Harper.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.584
Oh, oh.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.890
You know you guys
should have left me, right?

37:04.923 --> 37:08.994
We don't leave family behind.

37:11.297 --> 37:13.064
Yeah.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.033
(Rose grunts)

37:15.066 --> 37:17.669
Oh, you guys.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.449

(panting)

38:22.634 --> 38:25.103
Dad...

38:25.136 --> 38:26.705
please.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.908
(whimpering)

38:31.910 --> 38:35.847
-(Verity gasping)
-Sorry, kiddo.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.888
But you're not my daughter.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.394
The others are safe.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.430
They're heading for the ferry.
Run.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.097
What about you?

39:26.131 --> 39:27.766
I'll hold it off.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.334
(snarling)

39:29.367 --> 39:30.702
Run.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.438
Thank you.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.303
The power of Christ...

40:05.336 --> 40:07.639

Compel me, Marcus.

40:32.698 --> 40:36.001
I want to wake up!

(gasps)

40:37.969 --> 40:39.971
(panting)

40:54.319 --> 40:56.321
Get out of this house.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.494
You have no power here.

41:02.528 --> 41:05.196
Tomas, wait.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.498
This is not your home!

42:19.938 --> 42:21.439
Andy. Andy.

42:21.472 --> 42:23.775
Andy.

42:23.809 --> 42:27.512
I can't fight back much longer.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.215
It's too strong.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.253
Promise me...

42:35.286 --> 42:37.455
you won't let it get away.

42:37.488 --> 42:40.225
-Okay.
-That you won't...

42:40.258 --> 42:42.628
don't let it happen
to another family.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.863
Promise me.

-No, no, no, no, no.
-...for the deliverance

42:53.138 --> 42:55.106
of those who are enslaved
by the evil one.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.474
-You have to fight.
-All saints of Heaven...

42:56.507 --> 42:57.609
You have to fight, Andy.

42:57.643 --> 42:59.611
...come to our aid.

42:59.645 --> 43:01.579
-Fight it!
-Free us, O Lord,

43:01.613 --> 43:02.881
from thoughts of jealousy,

43:02.914 --> 43:04.783
rage and death.
