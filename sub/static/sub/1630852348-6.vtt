NARRATOR: <i>Time goes fast,</i>
<i>but it seems to have stood still</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.185
<i>in this dust-coated mechanic shop,</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:22.731
<i>where rusted road signs and faded photos</i>
<i>are pinned to the walls,</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:26.067
<i>like the dreams of this once-hopeful</i>
<i>racer-turned-mechanic.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:30.071
<i>Those dreams are distant memories.</i>
<i>Or are they?</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:32.073
<i>There you are! You busy?</i>

00:32.282 --> 00:36.661
Busy? Please. I've been idle
since they built that highway on Route 66.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.874
NARRATOR:<i> Well, big news! The Piston Cup</i>
<i>has space for one more race car.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.042
Wait, really?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
NARRATOR: <i>Yes!</i>
<i>This is your chance to get back</i>

00:43.835 --> 00:45.670
<i>on the racetrack.</i>
<i>Isn't that what you've always wanted?</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:47.756
Oh, wanted? Oh, it's more than that.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.133
Ever since I rolled into this here town,

00:50.216 --> 00:54.471
I had dreams of going wheel-to-wheel
with Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez.

00:54.554 --> 00:58.224
But ever since my race car blew
its engine block in that pickup race,

00:58.683 --> 01:01.478
-it's only been a tailpipe dream.
-NARRATOR: <i>Well, it's time to get out</i>

01:01.561 --> 01:04.314
<i>from beneath the hood and back</i>
<i>behind the steering wheel, kid.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:06.816
-Wow, you sound like Doc.
-NARRATOR: <i>Really?</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:09.944
<i>Was it the overall message or the timbre</i>
<i>of years lived in my voice then?</i>

01:10.111 --> 01:13.406
Oh, son of a Buick!
I still don't have a race car.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.326
Why do you think I'm sitting
here wrenching instead of racing?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.536
I knew it was too good to be true.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.499
I'm outta luck unless they let me
enter the Piston Cup on a bicycle.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.417
NARRATOR:
<i>What if I told you I can get you a car?</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:27.128
<i>Something the likes</i>
<i>of which the Piston Cup has never seen!</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:29.380
<i>-What would you say then?</i>
-What would I say?

01:29.881 --> 01:33.051
I'll tell you what I'd say.
I'd say, "Ka-chow!"

01:33.134 --> 01:34.511

02:23.893 --> 02:25.019
where speed reigns,

02:25.103 --> 02:27.939

-(CAR ENGINE REVS)

03:26.915 --> 03:30.752
(CONTESTANTS CHEER, APPLAUD)

03:30.919 --> 03:35.590
Food artists, your task today is to give
our former racer-turned-mechanic

03:35.757 --> 03:40.261
what she asks for. An original race car
that can go wheel-to-wheel

03:40.386 --> 03:43.681
with the likes of Lightning McQueen
and Cruz Ramirez.

03:44.182 --> 03:49.062
And please know, any food you do not use
in your builds will be donated to charity.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.856
Benny, what would you be
looking for from our artists?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.234
We'll be looking for technical ability.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.821
Your race car must have that special,
professional polish to it.

03:59.364 --> 04:03.451
We want to see your creativity.
<i>Cars </i>is one of the most beloved stories,

04:03.701 --> 04:08.206
and everyone knows that the eyes
can tell an amazing, emotional story.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.585
I wanna see the eyes of your race car
to tell me a story about who they are.

04:12.877 --> 04:16.756
Now, what kind of race would this be
if we didn't clock your time?

04:17.173 --> 04:20.718
That's why you've got until the sun sets
over Mater's garage.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.264

your foodscapes by then,

She's an ice cream truck.
No one's gonna think

04:45.660 --> 04:47.412
that she is gonna
be able to go fast enough.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.082
I think we're gonna surprise

to some large foodscapes.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.239
-Absolutely.
-Do you know we have

05:23.406 --> 05:26.409
a world champion ice carver on our team?

Silver-medal Olympian.

-Oh, my goodness!
-(ALL CHUCKLE)

05:31.122 --> 05:33.166

be getting a little bit of ice

05:33.249 --> 05:35.084
when it comes to today's design?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.878
-Yes! (CHUCKLES)
-This kind.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.923
-KEKE: <i>Ms. Frosty McCoy.</i>
-JOANNA: <i>She's a sassy girl.</i>

<i>that we know that Frosty has.</i>

05:49.140 --> 05:52.560
For most of the body,
we're gonna do sugar panels

05:52.727 --> 05:55.063
to give the car a glossy look,
just like in the movie.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.565
Wait for a second.
Are you talking about isomalt panels?

05:57.690 --> 05:58.649
-Yes.
-Yes!

05:58.733 --> 06:01.110
Making big panels of isomalt

06:01.194 --> 06:04.822
is really tricky because
they can break with nothing.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.951
It's almost 300 pounds of sugar itself.
So, we're gonna be cruising for a while.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.495
-Yeah, okay.
-JOANNA: You won't be disappointed.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.830

We're gonna do a truck.
We're doing a truck. A vintage truck.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.963
It'll be like some of those
classic drag trucks...

06:21.047 --> 06:22.507
-Yes.
-...as opposed to, you know,

06:22.715 --> 06:25.968
the generic race car.
We want a new kind of race car.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.721
MICHAELA: <i>We're gonna go pink, too, right?</i>

06:28.846 --> 06:30.848

<i>So, we'll use some sour tape...</i>

06:31.057 --> 06:32.975
MICHAELA: <i>Pink strawberry</i>
<i>wafer cookies?</i>

06:33.142 --> 06:34.185
SAMANTHA:<i> Yes, I like that.</i>

06:34.352 --> 06:37.146
So, I hear you guys call yourself,
"The Magical Madams."

06:37.230 --> 06:38.815
-We do.
-Why that name?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.525
-We're all scenic painters.
-We're scenic artists.

JENNIFER: We're behind-the-scenes ladies.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.488
We've all built stage sets,
and painted stage sets.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.408
We've made large-scale builds before.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.451
<i>We've done a couple of foodscapes.</i>

06:50.576 --> 06:53.621
So, you guys really do know how to build
probably on all different types of scales?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.623
-We do.
-It's just maybe the mediums this time,

06:55.706 --> 06:56.791
-that's a little bit...
-Absolutely.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.126
-A fun challenge.
-The perishables.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.419
-Yeah!
-Yes!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.003
-It's a fun challenge.
-Large-scale is no problem.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.005
Actually,
this is considered small-scale for us.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.340

-Ooh!

07:04.465 --> 07:05.967

Any specific technical elements
that you're planning

-to incorporate in the design?
-I'm going to be making

07:11.931 --> 07:14.225
-the eyes out of isomalt, so...
-And this is your first time?

07:14.308 --> 07:16.310
This is gonna be my first
larger-scale isomalt.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.521
Don't forget the eyes are so important.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.732
I mean, you look at Lightning McQueen,
and you know what he's thinking...

07:22.066 --> 07:23.734
-SAMANTHA: Yes.
-AMIRAH: ...with just the eyes. (CHUCKLES)

07:23.818 --> 07:26.195
Is there a name for our car yet?

07:26.362 --> 07:27.613
-We have named it Pepper.
-Pepper.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.240
Pepper? I love that name.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.499

the most futuristic

07:38.583 --> 07:40.626
-the most sleek.
-Absolutely.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.128
And I think if we can get

07:42.211 --> 07:46.424
any of that kind of look in here at all,
then that'd be so amazing.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.426

that this is gonna fit right

08:15.411 --> 08:17.622

-LINCOLN: We thought through this a lot.

08:17.705 --> 08:22.084
Like, how the types of foods we could
use to really get an ombré effect.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.213

<i>with some broccolis</i>

CATRINA: <i>Cheese at the front,</i>
<i>for the nice, cheesy smile.</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:32.720

about this to me is

08:32.845 --> 08:34.847
how many different
food ingredients you have.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.601
But the scariest part for me is how many
different food ingredients you have.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.353
-Yeah.
-So, but, you know, it can

08:40.561 --> 08:43.272
go in either direction.
It can be a little bit of a...

08:43.397 --> 08:46.859
Not a hot rod, but a hot mess.
And so I feel like,

08:47.109 --> 08:50.655

09:24.939 --> 09:26.732
I feel like Santa right now.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.401
-Bring 'em on.
-Let's go.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.362
Let's check off everything that we've got
and then lay it out.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.947
MICHAELA: We'll assembly line
at the beginning

09:33.030 --> 09:34.240
right now as we're prepping,

09:34.365 --> 09:36.325
-and then Jen and I will be...
-Kinda sculpting...

09:36.450 --> 09:38.035
-Yeah, sculpting...
-...and getting the general shape of

09:38.119 --> 09:40.663
of each section of the vehicle.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.707
LINCOLN: Probably wanna get
our structure going,

09:42.832 --> 09:44.834
and we can start prepping some
of these broccolis.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.420
That's a good idea.
I'll start cutting some of the butternut.

09:51.173 --> 09:55.261
AARON: <i>I'll be creating some side-view</i>
<i>mirrors out of the butternut squash.</i>

09:55.678 --> 09:58.556
What do you guys think?
Should I cut the end off

09:58.681 --> 10:00.224
or leave this end?

10:00.516 --> 10:02.435
-Like, work it in?
-I don't know,

10:02.560 --> 10:04.812
I kinda like that...
the uniqueness of that.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.357
AARON: I'm thinking slicing jicama,
sticking it inside.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.359
But I'm gonna use that for the glass.
So, it's pretty cool, right?

10:10.484 --> 10:11.652
-Oh! I like it a lot.
-LINCOLN: It's great.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.112
All right, here you go.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.947
Uh-huh. Yes.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.784
JOANNA: Maggie's making the royal

10:18.909 --> 10:20.286
-I'll be right back.
-JOANNA: I'll let you know

10:20.411 --> 10:21.454

10:23.873 --> 10:28.336
VICTOR: I'm carving the lips that gonna go
on the face of our racing car.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.964
So, I'm using a chisel that's literally
from my town where I born,

10:32.089 --> 10:34.133
so this is the best luck for me.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.511
I grew up in a small town,
widely known as

10:37.637 --> 10:39.430
the carving capital of the Philippines.

10:40.348 --> 10:44.310
I'm so fortunate that in my young age,
I already learned how to carve the wood.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.188
-JOANNA: <i>Vic does everything.</i>
-MAGGIE: <i>Yeah.</i>

10:47.313 --> 10:49.315
<i>Vic can carve anything that you give him.</i>

10:49.523 --> 10:51.609
I just love saying
my friend's an Olympian.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.445
-(CHUCKLES) It's the coolest.
-(JOANNA CHUCKLING)

10:55.154 --> 10:56.280
MAGGIE: Making a mess!

10:56.989 --> 11:01.577
Right now, I am currently making
all of the eyebrows, eyelashes,

11:01.702 --> 11:06.040
as well as the eyeballs out of pastillage.
Pastillage is like a sugar dough,

11:06.248 --> 11:08.793
and we use this just because
it firms up so well.

11:09.126 --> 11:13.881
And I am going to be decorating,
our eyebrows and eyelashes with food gel.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.842
And I'll be covering it with poppy seeds.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.888
You won't be able to see any white
through it, so it'll give a nice texture.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.308
-How's that cake looking?
-Looking great!

11:24.433 --> 11:26.310
-Awesome!
-CATRINA: Let's start to stack it.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.603
All right.

11:28.270 --> 11:33.317
AARON:<i> Both, Catrina and I are working on</i>
<i>layering cake. Aaron's working on carving.</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:37.655
<i>So, you can start seeing the shape</i>
<i>of our car come together.</i>

11:38.155 --> 11:41.617
Can you step back for a second?
Let me know if it lookin' rounded.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.287
When I think of why
I would want to win this competition,

11:45.496 --> 11:47.039
I think a lot about my family.

11:47.331 --> 11:51.836
<i>When I'm carving, and my kids come</i>
<i>to the event, they love it.</i>

11:52.169 --> 11:54.505
<i>And people walk up,</i>
<i>and they're like, "That's my dad,"</i>

11:55.297 --> 11:58.551
<i>I feel like a lot of what I'm doing</i>
<i>is just to make my family proud.</i>

11:59.093 --> 12:02.555
(EXHALES DEEPLY) This thing
is taking longer than I thought.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.683
-CATRINA: Oh, you guys...
-What do we need? How's the cheese coming?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.019
Oh, slow. It's coming slow.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.314
<i>So, the cheese is just...</i>
<i>it's not sticking.</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:15.151
<i>I'm having to heat it up</i>
<i>to try to get it to mold,</i>

12:15.359 --> 12:16.861
<i>and then I'm having</i>
<i>to try to cool it down,</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:18.988
and I'm just creating more
and more grease,

12:19.155 --> 12:20.740
and nothing is sticking to it.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.451
AARON:
This is kind of a disaster, actually.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.871
'Cause the cheese won't stick,
I can see that.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.748
LINCOLN: Yeah, it's gonna
just keep peeling down.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.375
-AARON: It's not working.
-CATRINA:<i> I'm so frustrated.</i>

12:31.584 --> 12:35.379
I've taken so much time trying
to get it to work and it's just not.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.174
We might just have
to hold this until later.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.135
Yeah. Maybe we ought to keep it rolling.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.805
Have you guys looked at the sun lately?
It's moved so much.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.390
MICHAELA: Oh, man. Okay.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.976
-We need to pick up the pace.
-Let's go. Let's go.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.856
SAMANTHA:<i> I am currently making</i>
<i>the first batch of royal icing.</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:57.818
I'm gonna end up using a ton
of royal icing as an adhesive property.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.779
<i>We know it's gonna be really strong,</i>

12:59.904 --> 13:01.781

to a construction adhesive,

13:01.906 --> 13:02.990
which is what we're used to.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.659
So, we try to find things
that are equivalent to our world,

13:05.743 --> 13:07.620
and this is as close
as I've been able to find.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.955
When are we doing the bed of the truck?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.791
-Right now.
-MICHAELA: Right now.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.876
You're gonna look adorable
sitting in the back of that.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.504
We're choosing strawberry wafers
for the truck bed,

13:16.587 --> 13:18.881
because we like the color and texture.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.717
<i>They're going to be fairly fast to apply.</i>

13:21.801 --> 13:25.221
<i>We can fill it in nice,</i>
<i>and neat and keeping neat lines.</i>

13:25.429 --> 13:28.015
I would say start on the checkerboard.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.642

-VICTOR: How's the sugar?
-I'm so happily cooking.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.119

JENNIFER: We're having a bit
of an issue with the pink wafers.

14:51.307 --> 14:56.353
The pink wafers are buckling
as the royal icing dries.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.105
They're just kinda falling off.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.274
SAMANTHA: Of all the things
that we were attaching,

15:00.357 --> 15:03.527
I never for a second thought
the sugar wafers would be a problem.

15:04.361 --> 15:09.783
All the wafer cookies are just buckling.
The royal icing isn't really working,

15:09.950 --> 15:13.704
which is pretty devastating,
because it's on the entire car.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.166

What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.961
Should I just scrape the main layer off
and leave the back layer?

-Just to like...
-Yes, do it.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.844

18:58.428 --> 19:01.265
-So, it's Pepper. And Salt.
-What is it? Salt and Pepper.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.100
MICHAELA: We make her
like a French version of us.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.311
SAMANTHA:<i> Can we... get</i>
<i>some kind of black leather look to it?</i>

19:06.395 --> 19:08.272
MICHAELA: I<i> think we'd lay down all nori.</i>

19:08.355 --> 19:09.731
JENNIFER:<i> So, what's gonna be our pit?</i>

19:09.815 --> 19:11.150
MICHAELA: <i>Give her glasses</i>
<i>out of the apricots.</i>

19:11.275 --> 19:12.442
Wouldn't that be cute?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.069
-'Cause we all have glasses.
-I think so.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.779

-No, I like it.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.532
-JOANNA: Yes.
-MAGGIE: With pits.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.784
What's our pit?
You think an avocado for the nose?

19:20.951 --> 19:22.452
-VICTOR: <i>Avocado for the nose.</i>
-JOANNA: <i>A big nose.</i>

19:22.578 --> 19:23.996
VICTOR: <i>Yeah, and then eyes.</i>

19:24.079 --> 19:25.539
<i>-And an apron.</i>
-JOANNA:<i> And an apron.</i>

19:25.622 --> 19:26.623
-VICTOR:<i> We're set.</i>
-JOANNA: <i>Yes.</i>

19:26.707 --> 19:29.376
MAGGIE:<i> We are going to be adding</i>
<i>a little magic, sugar, and spice</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:34.590
into our little pit crew. We're thinking
literal spices, and, of course,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.301
-there's always magic with our team, so...
-MAGGIE: Looks great.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.678
-He's getting there.
-And then, where is the nose?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.680
-The avocado.
-Avocado.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.516
We need lips. We need an apron.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.685
-Victor, I love you.
-VICTOR: I love you, too, Maggie.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.979
MAGGIE: Okay, back to this Frosty McCoy.

19:49.938 --> 19:54.776
The sun is in the middle of the sky.
With the plot thickening, it's definitely

19:54.860 --> 19:59.615
a little more added to our plate.
But our isomalt is sticking.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.825
We haven't had any cracks on it,

20:02.075 --> 20:04.077
because we believe
that we are number one.

-SAMANTHA: Oh, no!

20:11.126 --> 20:12.878
JOANNA: It's okay. Okay.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.338
SAMANTHA: Her isomalt.

JOANNA: Watch your hands.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.678
-AMIRAH: You guys okay?
-VICTOR: Yeah. This will be okay.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.222
-BENNY: Oh, my gosh.
-AMIRAH: There's just not

20:23.305 --> 20:25.515
a lot of time for them
to have isomalt panels

20:25.599 --> 20:28.352
that are shattering like this.
I don't know if they have backups.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.187
This is the last thing you want happening.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.732
-VICTOR: Oops.
-MAGGIE: You okay Vic?

20:34.399 --> 20:35.525
VICTOR: No.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.488
To panel the entire car in isomalt
is definitely a huge challenge.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.740
Especially when you're working
under pressure,

20:41.865 --> 20:45.869
-isomalt is not the best medium.
-I don't know how you recover from that.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.455
I don't know if they're gonna be able
to recover from that.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.667
-MAGGIE: I gotta fix this.
-Okay, I'm gonna start cooking.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.172
Let's go and spray this thing.
Got a nice consistent coat.

AARON:<i> We've got a design</i>
<i>that's gonna be doing an ombré.</i>

21:01.343 --> 21:04.096
We're going for gradients
from one color to a next.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.681
I'mma let you finish that.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.224
I'm gonna start prepping
some of these vegetables.

<i>broccoli, blueberries.</i>

21:11.603 --> 21:12.854

<i>a natural look of a flame</i>
<i>to have like that mix of colors.</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:20.195
Part of our strategy with getting
that consistent blend of color.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.074
<i>Just map out a pattern.</i>
<i>We have to make sure</i>

21:24.157 --> 21:27.035
<i>that we have this color down</i>
<i>because this might look like</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:28.370
<i>a hot mess of color.</i>

21:29.329 --> 21:30.622
CATRINA: This cheese isn't working.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.418
Let's get rid of it,
I don't wanna look at it any longer.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.461

<i>I think I'm just gonna take</i>
<i>some modelling chocolate.</i>

21:43.051 --> 21:47.055
<i>We'll get a nice seamless look,</i>
<i>and then we'll just blend into our flame.</i>

21:47.556 --> 21:49.891
I'm not having to worry
about if its gonna fall off.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.895
I feel it's giving us
a better covering consistency.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.230
Feeling more like a car.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
LINCOLN: These veggies are taking forever.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.696
AARON: I know. It's taking a lot longer
than I thought. And time is running out.

22:02.779 --> 22:06.825
I am a little worried because I wanna put
some good detail into the eyes.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.952
So, I really wanna make sure
that I have enough time

22:09.119 --> 22:10.162
to get those right.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.913
I've gotta step away for a little bit.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.335
MAGGIE:<i> I feel like a disaster.</i>

22:17.627 --> 22:19.379
<i>If he can't get the isomalt down,</i>

22:19.588 --> 22:22.716
<i>I know Victor's not gonna have enough time</i>
<i>to carve the engine.</i>

22:22.799 --> 22:25.844
<i>We'll definitely have to do something else</i>
<i>on the sides.</i>

22:26.053 --> 22:29.014
JOANNA: <i>The sun is setting,</i>
<i>and we're starting to run out of time.</i>

22:29.181 --> 22:32.768
<i>We have a lot more isomalt panels</i>
<i>and it's not just the cooking process,</i>

22:32.893 --> 22:35.270
<i>it has to cool, and then we need</i>
<i>to adjust it, and then glue it,</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:37.939
and it's pretty time-consuming,
so we're gonna change our plan

22:38.148 --> 22:43.028
<i>and do a royal icing, like, drip,</i>
<i>to kind of bring it down to the size</i>

22:43.320 --> 22:45.655
<i>of all the panels that we aren't gonna</i>
<i>be able to cover.</i>

22:45.822 --> 22:47.657
<i>We'll make it look like he's dripping snow</i>

22:47.824 --> 22:50.035

<i>and coat it and we'll be okay.</i>

22:50.494 --> 22:52.371

to use a speed square

22:52.496 --> 22:54.414

22:54.581 --> 22:56.958
I bet there's some kinda
culinary tool to do this.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.252
MICHAELA: Probably,
but that's not what we know.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.381
That's true.
This feels very much like model making.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.467
We're working on the sour tape
on the hood.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.638

a different solution.

-Hello. Welcome back.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.856
I see that you guys are using pins.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.150
Michaela sculpted the mouth
and was starting to cover it

24:03.233 --> 24:06.278
with the candies.
We discovered that pinning it in place

24:06.403 --> 24:08.655
while it dries is the best thing
'cause sometimes it peels away.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.073
-But if you pin it...
-AMIRAH: This is so smart.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.325
-BENNY: It's smart, yeah!
-I've never seen it used on a foodscape,

24:12.409 --> 24:13.743
but I'm taking notes

24:13.869 --> 24:16.121
<i>because when you're defying gravity,</i>
<i>pinning it</i>

24:16.246 --> 24:19.040
and then when it dries taking them away
is just such a smart technique.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.584
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:04.808 --> 28:08.144
I have never seen teams work faster
to achieve their goals.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.980
Now, it's time to see who's getting
that checkered flag waved

28:11.064 --> 28:12.399

-mishaps during this process.
-Oh, yeah!

28:26.162 --> 28:29.124
With the isomalt, how are you guys
feeling, what are your thoughts?

28:29.290 --> 28:32.293
We feel good. We're surprised
at how much we were able to accomplish.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.338
You had to create a race car
to help our mechanic.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.673
Please tell me the story

28:36.798 --> 28:38.508

28:43.763 --> 28:46.307
MAGGIE:<i> So, in order to help</i>
<i>the mechanic win the race,</i>

28:46.433 --> 28:49.185
<i>we decided to have the secret</i>
<i>under the engine.</i>

28:49.310 --> 28:53.773

29:00.071 --> 29:02.824
<i>The windows and body of the car</i>

<i>Her eyelashes and eyebrows are poppy seeds</i>

29:18.840 --> 29:20.425
<i>The eye, also pastillage,</i>

29:20.550 --> 29:23.136

<i>Going up to the cupcake,</i>

-Ooh!
-MAGGIE: And then when the plot thickened,

29:34.147 --> 29:35.815

29:35.940 --> 29:38.485
<i>we have our nose as the avocado.</i>

29:38.735 --> 29:41.488

30:28.868 --> 30:32.789
The glitter, like you said, is magic,
and there's tons of sugar on it.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.503
I do want to talk about the eye,
because expression is just so important.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.881
When you're making a winky face,
if you close your eye,

30:42.006 --> 30:45.176
your eyelash would be level with your eye
and not up with your eyebrow,

30:45.301 --> 30:47.595

-it could be missing an eye...

that winky face is exactly the sassiness

30:54.477 --> 30:56.271
that you guys were looking for. (CHUCKLES)

30:56.396 --> 30:58.398
Of course, you guys have issues
with the cracking.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.318
Maybe the isomalt panel
wasn't resting completely flat.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.486

-Hey, Keke.

We started this competition, you guys
coming in straight from the theater world,

31:31.139 --> 31:33.308
very familiar with creating things
from the ground up,

31:33.433 --> 31:34.934
but just not with food.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.313
How are you feeling about food
and working with it in this way?

31:38.438 --> 31:40.857
-I think we all learned a lot.
-Oh, absolutely.

31:40.982 --> 31:44.193
We tried out a lot of things,
not all of them ended up working,

31:44.319 --> 31:45.737
but, you know, we tried.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.698
And I think we're proud of the things
that we did manage to accomplish.

<i>help the mechanic build a race car,</i>

32:00.752 --> 32:03.713
<i>that incorporated her signature smize,</i>
<i>and had a lot of her heart.</i>

32:03.838 --> 32:04.964
I mean, she's a mechanic,

32:05.089 --> 32:07.133
so she wanted to take this truck
and soup it up.

32:07.258 --> 32:10.637
<i>She knows that it has a V8 under the hood,</i>
<i>and that it can really take her</i>

32:10.762 --> 32:13.598
where she wants to go.
And she has her eyes on McQueen,

32:13.765 --> 32:16.476
so you can see that reflected
in the lightning bolts in her eyes.

MICHAELA: Sel<i> is salt in French. She has</i>
<i>on some nice pink forks on the front.</i>

32:48.800 --> 32:49.801
-Yes!
-And then she's got...

32:49.968 --> 32:51.260
-And she's got...
-She's got glasses.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.263
-...she's got her cat eyes.
-KEKE:<i> Got her cat-eye glasses, I love it.</i>

32:54.389 --> 32:57.225

of dried apricots and cherries.

32:57.725 --> 32:58.977
<i>The body is all nori.</i>

32:59.060 --> 33:01.104

in black just like you guys.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.981
-She is.
-She's very stylish.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.483

that I love how you guys

<i>-to create such a perfect pattern.</i>
-KEKE: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

-I can tell it was time consuming.
-Mm-hmm!

33:18.496 --> 33:19.872
So great job.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.333
<i>The little fruit chews</i>
<i>that you used on the sides,</i>

<i>the way that you guys</i>
<i>placed them one by one,</i>

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.883

because, wow, neon!

<i>The fact where you guys were able to find</i>
<i>so many different ingredients</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:37.390
<i>in the same color is just so crazy to me.</i>

33:37.598 --> 33:40.768
I don't think I could think
of that many neon candies in one tone.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.645
-I think that that was really smart...
-(CHUCKLING)

33:42.770 --> 33:44.856
...to keep the truck just super cohesive.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.984
The other thing I absolutely love
is that you chose to

33:48.151 --> 33:51.654
<i>sort of line the defined areas</i>
<i>with the licorice.</i>

33:51.863 --> 33:54.574
<i>I think that this is such</i>
<i>a cartoon animated look.</i>

33:54.741 --> 33:56.701
<i>I absolutely love how you used</i>

33:56.868 --> 34:00.538
the silver on the baguettes
to sort of line everything.

34:00.663 --> 34:04.375
I do wish that they were closer together
just so it's sort of continued.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.212
When I look at the piece, it looks
a little bit unfinished in some areas.

34:08.337 --> 34:12.884
I can still see those areas where it's
obvious that it needs something else.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.344
But... but I can't believe
that this is your first time working

34:15.428 --> 34:16.888

-and how your foodscape turned out?
-We really stretched ourselves,

we tried to step outside
of our comfort zones,

that we've never done before.

<i>and curvy style to it.</i>

<i>and this red fondant</i>
<i>and modelling chocolate front</i>

35:16.239 --> 35:19.492
<i>really represents</i>
<i>that beginning of the flame.</i>

<i>white popcorn.</i>

-Oh, yes.

<i>we created Ember.</i>

<i>to get that wrinkly, bumping texture,</i>

-because we're all...
-Parents.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.572
(CHUCKLES) And we all just have
a couple wrinkles,

35:57.655 --> 35:59.991
<i>and so we want our pit crew</i>
<i>to definitely represent the fact</i>

<i>that we've been around the block</i>
<i>a couple times.</i>

<i>used spicy peppers to then create fire,</i>

done differently is I wish

that the butternut squash
rear-view mirrors were actually red,

36:55.504 --> 36:57.673
<i>just to tie it back into the car.</i>

36:57.757 --> 37:00.301
I just wish that they looked
a little more finished.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.427
Okay.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.429
The thing that I noticed
is just the carving.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.890
It's just perfect execution.
