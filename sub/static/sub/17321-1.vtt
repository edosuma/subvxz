Gigi , I have said before. I do not 
bother when I'm working .

If you do not bother probably 
will never exchange the middle again.

05:28.576 --> 05:31.938
Big deal . Whenever I can 
paint stockings on my feet.

05:32.192 --> 05:37.771

- How much does this fabric 
- 1500. Is it too much paint , you know ?

09:04.660 --> 09:09.000
Yes , I write that Adam Sorg 
is a commercial success .

09:09.001 --> 09:12.246
But an artistic failure, 
right?

09:12.882 --> 09:15.830
Well, sr . Sorg , 
I would not go that far.

09:17.089 --> 09:23.000
Let's say a commercial success, 
but an artistic impostor.

09:25.065 --> 09:30.753
Your use of the colors , let 
generous , is not well implemented.

09:32.192 --> 09:36.639
Mr. Gregorovich , let me 
express in words ...

09:36.640 --> 09:41.668
I can not express myself as 
through the fabric. You're full of ...

09:55.323 --> 09:59.832
Adam is a critical 
! Why have to irritate Gregorovich ?

10:01.108 --> 10:02.897
He said nothing as terrible.

10:02.898 --> 10:06.857
¿ Farnsworth, 
you know that is the \"F \"?

10:06.858 --> 10:09.901
- Adam , for the love of God ... 
- \"F \" is for ...

10:11.023 --> 10:12.023
Farnsworth.

10:12.221 --> 10:16.260
They say it has a story behind 
all the pictures he paints.

10:16.261 --> 10:18.610
It is a fascinating man .

10:19.353 --> 10:22.586
I wish it were a 
little quieter.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.962
It is so colorful.

10:26.184 --> 10:31.585
It's a great thing to have the honor 
of this painting. This fashionable.

10:31.937 --> 10:37.982
Madame , I would be happier if 
said I was a good painter .

But I will not discourage it.

10:45.657 --> 10:51.040

Dear , you should talk to the

If we get married , 
I'll hire a psychiatrist.

Adam , you 're wet all

13:28.883 --> 13:32.707
Why not? These fabrics were 
made ​​to use watercolors.

13:33.050 --> 13:34.915
Adam , you're impossible .

13:36.135 --> 13:38.308
If I am impossible, perhaps I should

This may be worth something .

14:07.477 --> 14:10.642
¿ Adam has more red paintings

14:13.392 --> 14:15.113

with red paint ?

14:16.397 --> 14:19.105
Adam , I have to agree 
with that critical , Gregorovich .

14:20.196 --> 14:22.236
I think it can improve 
the use of colors.

14:27.028 --> 14:30.984
You know one thing ? 
I agree with you .

14:33.453 --> 14:35.623

Quiet Lord. It's too early 
for breakfast.

18:34.369 --> 18:35.378

tomato juice in my veins .

20:06.589 --> 20:08.716
Adam , you must be sick.

20:08.717 --> 20:12.475
I 'm willing to give my 
blood. But I 'm not going to give it all .

20:12.476 --> 20:14.978
To cover this fabric , you will 
need a superwoman .

20:14.979 --> 20:17.099
- I'm going out 
- .I'm not torturing !

20:17.100 --> 20:23.064

Probably black serious.

25:18.115 --> 25:19.662
Damn fool .

26:08.484 --> 26:11.833
There is only one problem 
to paint this way.

26:14.328 --> 26:16.770
This table ends with you .

26:42.827 --> 26:46.065
Ink , mate,

26:46.919 --> 26:50.630
Leave this box to Bank 
Blood and reworks .

26:50.631 --> 26:53.947
What kind of vampire are you, 
painting with blood?

26:53.948 --> 26:55.668
Are you a painter or a butcher ?

26:57.194 --> 27:00.994
You have to talk to Farnsworth 
and tell him you have something big.

27:00.995 --> 27:06.246
He has to invite one critic 
Gregorovich , to see your new paint.

27:06.247 --> 27:09.906
You have to be ready 
for some , if you care .

27:10.885 --> 27:14.141
No where will you find the 
blood to finish this.

27:15.961 --> 27:17.984
It is certainly a great painting .

minutes more and I'll have to go.

My dear friend , I have to say on behalf 
of the lady. This is not a Michelangelo .

35:59.840 --> 36:04.783

I can not accept less for that 
paint. It will be a classic.

- Can we stay here?

39:41.855 --> 39:44.507

It is clouding , baby . 
Better go home .

41:16.304 --> 41:19.611

46:45.646 --> 46:48.291
- What 
-I said no is for sale !

46:55.955 --> 47:01.238
I hope you are satisfied.

47:02.579 --> 47:05.099

47:34.332 --> 47:39.640
My dear Farnsworth, his genius 
crazy not diluted this painting.

47:42.799 --> 47:46.844
Did that boy going to dive 
with you today , dear ?

47:47.169 --> 47:50.213
You speak of Rolf

47:50.214 --> 47:52.206

And he's a good guy ?

47:55.125 --> 47:59.144
Yes, dear. He is not 
as your crazy painter.

47:59.483 --> 48:03.030
April , I determine to 
have one of those paintings .

48:03.314 --> 48:07.164
The sr . Farnsworth says Adam Sorg 
no business in weeks.

48:07.457 --> 48:09.743
He seems to be hibernating.

48:10.372 --> 48:15.521
Mr. Farnsworth says Sorg has 
a house not far from the beach.

48:15.522 --> 48:19.983
And he has not left these days . 
Not to buy art supplies.

48:20.473 --> 48:25.135
Vamos a la playa mother. Maybe I convince 
mr . Sorg to paint a picture of mine .

48:25.136 --> 48:28.301
Are not you going 
to the deserted part , right?

48:28.302 --> 48:31.523
You'll spend half the day 
to get there.

48:31.524 --> 48:36.033
We like you, mother. Other 
beaches are too crowded .

48:36.375 --> 48:38.931
We found a place we like 
and probably go there.

48:39.297 --> 48:41.319
And after dark , 
aremos a picknick .

48:41.320 --> 48:42.883
I think Iran late.

48:42.884 --> 48:46.710
Do not worry, mother. What can 
go on a deserted beach?

52:30.054 --> 52:34.173

? Come on, idiots.

52:35.329 --> 52:37.353
- All good

52:37.925 --> 52:39.079
Here they are .

52:48.836 --> 52:51.621

- Yes , it's all here .

52:53.144 --> 52:56.338

far, clowns.

58:10.826 --> 58:11.903
Adam Sorg .

58:11.904 --> 58:16.463

you were lost there.

59:15.937 --> 59:18.984
No. I was looking for ... 
one thing.

59:19.561 --> 59:21.908
Were you looking for a 
thing ? What was it?

59:22.188 --> 59:25.256
Nothing

- As I'm not looking for anything ... 
- Acabare finding something .

59:38.138 --> 59:40.930

These , very quiet tonight .

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:20.139
I 'm trying to decide 
if I 'll do something.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.607
Sorry to be 
a lousy company.

01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:30.598
- Rolf , is that painter ... 
- Painter ?

01:01:31.452 --> 01:01:34.644
You mean , the guy who makes his living 
honestly painting houses ?

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:37.545
Or is the guy who 
has a beard and sandals ?

01:01:38.775 --> 01:01:41.439
He ... he wants to paint .

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:48.839
\" My cherie \" I am a painter 
famous. I would paint it.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.822
I 'm honored.

01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:58.659
Ah , that vocabulary . 
Can I paint it? \" Oui \"?

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.534
You can paint me .

01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:06.569
As well . You paint .

01:02:07.381 --> 01:02:11.264
As well . You repaint .

01:02:14.738 --> 01:02:16.107
That crazy !

01:02:36.771 --> 01:02:39.844
Because these nerve 
. Dear , calm down .

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:47.079
Already . I have a little something . 
A drink to cheer .

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.073
Paul , you know I do not drink ... 
milk.

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:01.850
What do you think of that painter ?

01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:09.268
He is a very famous painter . 
He wants me pose for him.

01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:11.657
Naked, I guess.

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.275
What makes you think that?

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:18.462
Because I'd like 
to paint naked .

01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:27.748
- You're not a painter 
- . If you cared , that does not prevent it me .

01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:36.256
Tell me when this Rasputin- 
Rembrandt wants poses naked ?

01:03:36.257 --> 01:03:40.686
Tonight . And for your information , 
he does not want to paint naked.

01:03:40.994 --> 01:03:45.678
Does not want to, ah? Obviously 
knows something about you that I do not know.

01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:49.561
Well , miss . Carter , Colonel 
Rolf is in charge.

01:03:49.804 --> 01:03:53.207
Let's go get the car and go to 
more phone next post ...

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:56.461
and call your painter 
for the wait itself .

01:03:56.932 --> 01:04:01.664
Tonight 
. We can say that an unexpectedly emerged .

01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:03.749
We'll call right now

01:04:04.214 --> 01:04:08.889
- In that place is his studio 
- This ... this far .

01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:13.779
Rolf , if we both go, Jack and Sydney 
think that something is wrong .

01:04:14.786 --> 01:04:17.238
Give me the keys and I 'll go alone . 
You wait for them.

01:04:17.573 --> 01:04:18.585
You give me the keys.

01:04:18.586 --> 01:04:22.755
No, dear, I wanna go with you . 
Do not take a few minutes to arrive .

01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:29.231
They are far away. Besides that , they will 
back wet and they will spoil your car.

01:04:30.187 --> 01:04:34.696
Come on, sweetie . Give me the keys and 
when I return , I will be very good love .

01:04:34.697 --> 01:04:35.884
What kind of humor?

01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:44.002
That kind of humor . 
Now give me the keys.

01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:52.195
Well, before the end of the night you can 
be the owner of that car .

01:04:54.262 --> 01:04:55.263
Here are your shoes.

01:05:00.684 --> 01:05:01.836
And again soon.

01:06:44.275 --> 01:06:48.631
- No I'm doing here 
- . Yes, I know.

01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:55.063
Do your friends know that 
you here?

01:06:56.788 --> 01:06:58.686
No, but I can not stay 
for long.

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:03.181
I should have called to 
warn that it could not pose for you.

01:07:04.847 --> 01:07:07.268
Do they know I asked 
to pose for me?

01:07:08.105 --> 01:07:11.655
They know it was you 
or this house. Why?

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:16.872
Well, if we can not delay , 
better start .

01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:18.634
Sit over there.

01:07:28.476 --> 01:07:30.230
Want to do something?

01:07:31.561 --> 01:07:32.562
Not yet.

01:07:38.466 --> 01:07:40.656
Me should not pose or 
something?

01:07:43.045 --> 01:07:44.881
I'm not a photographer, 
am a painter .

01:07:50.194 --> 01:07:52.379
I paint what I feel , 
not what I see.

01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:01.126
You want me to sit here?

01:08:01.127 --> 01:08:04.793
Just for a moment . 
You know when to be moved .

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.986
That painting looks like blood .

01:08:08.987 --> 01:08:11.287
They refer to it when 
talk that leaves your blood ...

01:08:11.544 --> 01:08:13.056
That's not funny !

01:08:14.254 --> 01:08:19.225
Excuse me. Sorry . 
I'm just mad at me .

01:08:19.227 --> 01:08:22.979
- I better go 
- .No! No !

01:08:24.522 --> 01:08:28.988
I ... I'm almost ready .

01:08:32.285 --> 01:08:33.411
Stand there.

01:08:46.303 --> 01:08:53.087
- That's ... 
-Do not touch ! It is loaded .

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.759
- You want me ... 
-No!

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:05.604
Levante 
it I do not get nervous .

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.392
Hey , Jack , I want to undress !

01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:23.854
Why do not you take it ? 
You make me nervous .

01:09:24.258 --> 01:09:27.148
- Do not tell me 
- You could lose .

01:09:27.488 --> 01:09:29.626
And how would stay 
with half a bikini ?

01:09:29.995 --> 01:09:33.694
If only you keep this 
end up losing everything.

01:09:35.006 --> 01:09:38.877
Yo, you 'll lose . 
You either which way I go.

01:09:43.774 --> 01:09:47.201
Hey, where was your girl ? 
I flee ? Disappeared?

01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:48.723
She was making a phone call.

01:09:49.291 --> 01:09:53.152
- In that house 
- No, in the position of the road.

01:09:53.509 --> 01:09:57.331
Look, I have a light . 
I thought it was a desert.

01:09:58.103 --> 01:09:59.566
Uh , I 'm frozen .

01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:03.088
Do not tell me . You podés 
naked to Fort Knox.

01:10:03.089 --> 01:10:06.711
Not that kind of cold . 
This kind of cold, stupid.

01:10:06.712 --> 01:10:11.387
Why will not find more branches 
? April and I joined them.

01:10:11.388 --> 01:10:14.620
Now it's your turn . 
There's a mountain near the beach .

01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:18.042
Here we go , miss . Iceberg, 
go find branches.

01:10:18.043 --> 01:10:20.553
- Oh , wait a minute 
- . Well .

01:10:30.982 --> 01:10:33.531
I can not stay longer . 
What's the problem?

01:10:34.055 --> 01:10:38.177
You seem to not get 
to maintain the pose.

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:44.240
I tell you what I'll do . I'll help 
you keep your arms as well .

01:10:44.499 --> 01:10:47.789
- The memory will paint 
- . How to do that ?

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.484
Look .

01:10:52.511 --> 01:10:53.720
What are you doing ?

01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:58.230
Thus , you can relax your 
arms and maintain the same position.

01:10:58.971 --> 01:11:00.454
Do not tie me!

01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:03.662
It's just a moment, 
I think something up .

01:11:04.356 --> 01:11:05.746
You can wait just a minute.

01:11:06.949 --> 01:11:10.560
Wait here? I have to do , 
I can not move .

01:11:45.793 --> 01:11:48.810
Jack, come here to give me 
a hand , okay ?

01:11:50.546 --> 01:11:51.546
Jack!

01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:55.960
Jack!

01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:01.629
Holy Banana 
! Is the leg of a girl.

01:12:28.447 --> 01:12:33.027
I have to go. Back another day 
so ends .

01:12:33.028 --> 01:12:36.584
It's just one minute 
! I'm making the draft.

01:12:38.714 --> 01:12:43.654
- Look at that horrible madness 
- . It is the body of a girl.

01:12:43.932 --> 01:12:47.157
Brilliant deduction , expert 
! What now ?

01:12:47.883 --> 01:12:50.147
I go to that house, 
to call the police.

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:52.774
You two stay here . 
April should be back any minute.

01:12:52.775 --> 01:12:56.498
You're right, but I'll 
wait near the fire.

01:12:56.499 --> 01:12:59.574
Maybe I 'll call . I hope you 
have a phone there.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:03.518
If no , take 
a flashlight and illuminate several times.

01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:07.378
Gritare high enough that 
the police 4 counties heard.

01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:10.368
One more thing .

01:13:11.716 --> 01:13:15.984
To perfect neck line 
. Turn around for me.

01:13:16.732 --> 01:13:21.056
I'm tired . 
I loose . This is ridiculous .

01:13:21.881 --> 01:13:23.648
Do you say to me, \"ridiculous\" ?

01:13:23.997 --> 01:13:28.750
I never heard of anything like this 
before . This is not a way of painting .

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:30.761
Put me down !

01:13:30.762 --> 01:13:38.768
You will be immortalized in a 
fabric Sorg , like it or not .

01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:40.504
Turn around !

01:13:45.513 --> 01:13:49.613
Do what I ask . 
Turn around.

01:13:51.062 --> 01:13:55.459
- Count to twenty and open ended 
- . What ?

01:13:59.829 --> 01:14:05.291
Stay that way . 
No! Do not turn !

01:14:05.892 --> 01:14:11.669
For the love of ... 
Once. Twelve.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:15.248
I'm not having fun, sr . Sorg . 
Tell one to twenty.

01:14:18.597 --> 01:14:21.705
Thirteen . Fourteen .

01:14:22.477 --> 01:14:25.766
I can use ... 
April !

01:14:27.446 --> 01:14:30.855
- What the hell 's going on here 
- What are you doing with that ax ?

01:14:31.282 --> 01:14:32.871
I'm just working 
with an idea.

01:14:35.246 --> 01:14:38.346
That's her young boyfriend . 
Invite them to happen.

01:14:38.347 --> 01:14:42.022
I'm already inside . 
Where is your phone ?

01:14:42.363 --> 01:14:47.112
I have no phone . 
You're tough , young man.

01:14:47.113 --> 01:14:50.140
You also would be rude if 
see her tied girl.

01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:53.352
And a man with an ax 
in hand and blood in the other.

01:14:53.353 --> 01:14:56.159
- And a corpse on the beach 
. - A corpse ?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.385
- April , do not you're doing here ... 
-Stay away from her!

01:15:00.059 --> 01:15:02.888
Quiet ! If arriving 
come flying your head.

01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:09.208
Well , that ... Girl 
the beach ... it was a misunderstanding.

01:15:09.954 --> 01:15:12.900
- Nothing about it 
- . I do not believe that.

01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:14.832
First, 
not say it was a girl.

01:15:15.346 --> 01:15:17.907
And how would know that is a girl 
unless you 've killed ?

01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:22.298
Young man, 
is making a mistake .

01:15:22.299 --> 01:15:23.300
And let ...

01:15:24.054 --> 01:15:27.232
If you approach this weapon , 
le delivery head.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:32.688
And that girl on the beach ... 
it was nothing .

01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:35.271
He could live or die , 
and it would not matter.

01:15:35.605 --> 01:15:40.746
But now , she will live 
forever, in my fabric.

01:15:41.344 --> 01:15:44.410
She is immortal 
. She will live forever.

01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:49.015
That beach thing ... 
is just an empty shell. Just that.

01:15:49.643 --> 01:15:54.668
But life and blood 
it is what lives .

01:15:55.055 --> 01:16:00.308
That keeps it alive . 
She's alive in my painting .

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:06.795
His life, his blood ... 
people 's admired forever.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:14.427
Does her blood ? 
You use it as ink?

01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:20.799
Now , young man , get away from that 
weapon or your girl dies now.

01:16:22.155 --> 01:16:25.451
Stay away from that gun and stay 
aside. Stay away from that gun !

01:16:25.452 --> 01:16:28.423
Hey , man, 
is just a crazy game over !

01:16:29.739 --> 01:16:30.739
Stop !

01:16:34.135 --> 01:16:35.693
Oh , my God !

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.381
Oh , no!

01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:03.861
I do not buy 
a painting for some time.

01:18:21.609 --> 01:18:26.913
You must have courage , my friend, to 
destroy a painting worth millions .

01:18:28.817 --> 01:18:35.515
Mr. Gregorovich , I'm not 
burn a painting.

01:18:36.806 --> 01:18:41.008
I 'm lighting the pyre 
Funeral Adam Sorg .

01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:47.007
You could , at least , 
have saved the molding.
