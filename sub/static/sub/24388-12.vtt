We need an adorable poster campaign
by Friday, or we're toast.

00:53.344 --> 00:58.016
-I need ideas. You!
-Ah! We see a baby with a fuzzy tail.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.101
Ah! Nightmare fuel!
You're off the team.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.061
-Oh!
-You?

01:01.144 --> 01:05.315
Imagine a baby on a potty chair
that's made of flowers!

01:05.398 --> 01:07.400
Gross! Strangely beautiful,
but mostly gross.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.735
-You're off the team.
-But--

01:08.860 --> 01:11.154
[groans] I'm surrounded by amateurs.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.657
I could get better ideas
from some mail department intern.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.201
You, mail baby. Poster idea.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.703
-Go!
-Me?

01:20.205 --> 01:21.206
Uh...

01:21.289 --> 01:24.334

[chuckles] Brilliant!

01:33.510 --> 01:35.970
I'm digging what you're dumping, kid.
What's your name?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.931
Mega Fat Mail Room Intern Baby.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.100
How'd you like to be my Mega Fat intern

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
in the posters and greeting cards
department?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.146
Oh, my goodness!

01:45.230 --> 01:49.692
I get to work with Boss Baby,
the fastest-rising star in Baby Corp?

01:49.776 --> 01:50.902
Oh, you better believe it.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.029
Now get those snot rocks
out of your schnoz,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.531
buy a fresh pair of booties.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.534
Before every move,
ask yourself one question:

01:57.617 --> 02:00.036
how will this increase baby love?

02:00.120 --> 02:04.457
[gasps] You are so business savvy.
Are we going to be best friends?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.542
[chuckles]

02:05.625 --> 02:08.086
Well, I don't like
to make market predictions,

02:08.169 --> 02:10.713
but a smart guy like you filled with
advice like mine,

02:10.797 --> 02:13.591
well, I'd say stock
in You and Me Incorporated

02:13.675 --> 02:15.802
is going nowhere but up, up, up!

02:16.427 --> 02:17.887
-[singing]
-Will you listen to me?!

02:17.971 --> 02:20.223
This is urgent,
you noise-making dumpling.

02:20.306 --> 02:24.269
-We have to act on this!
-[gasps] You broke my noise machine.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.063
I am not cheap to repair!

02:27.438 --> 02:29.023
Will you please just listen?

02:30.108 --> 02:34.154
I've got a lead
on Bootsy Calico's master plan.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.949
"Six well-placed kittens."

02:38.032 --> 02:42.495
What does it mean? I figure Bootsy
has been planting kittens all around town.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.540
Mr. Pineapple,
that one he gave to the Mayor,

02:45.623 --> 02:50.962
Cat Cop, probably one of the copycats.
That's four. Who are the other two?

02:51.045 --> 02:53.882
We have suspects,
but we need resources to find them.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.051
This is a five-alarm,
all-hands-on-deck situation.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.386
Oof McGoof.

02:58.469 --> 03:02.181
It seems the teacher has become
the flunky, F-minus loser student.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.476
Have you forgotten
the first lesson you ever taught me?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.104
"How will this increase baby love?"

03:08.187 --> 03:11.774
Bootsy Calico is a madman.
The whole town is in jeopardy.

03:11.858 --> 03:16.613
-This is bigger than baby love.
-Oh, what? Now you talkin' crazy.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.783
Waste my time on your own time.
I'm shutting you diddy-diddy-down.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.994
-[imitates powering down noise]
-But...

03:23.411 --> 03:25.330
-Did you just call me a butt?
-What?

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831
A butt? No.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.960
One could interpret him
as having called you a butt.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.005
-What?
-Really, Boss Baby, a butt?

03:34.088 --> 03:37.425
-That's the very best you can do?
-Oh, I can do much better.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.929
Oh, you are not sassing me.
Are we doing this?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.681
I think you are sassing me,
and we are doing this.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.393
Okay. Fine. Magnus, it's time.
Hit that big red button.

03:47.894 --> 03:52.982
The button on this drawing you made me
carry around for months has been hit.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.943
[whistles]

03:55.026 --> 03:59.530
Kaboom! Let's go nuclear, Boss Baby.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.326
I've got hush-hush secret dirt on you,
naughty boy.

04:03.409 --> 04:07.997
And tomorrow morning,
I'm taking it to the board of directors.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.836
Secret dirt on me? You're bluffing.
You would've used it already.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.006
Oh, well, then I guess you have nothing
to worry about,

04:17.090 --> 04:21.386
until tomorrow, when I end your career.
Oh, I flipped it. Bye-bye-byesies.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.473
It's cool. I'm good.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.475
This is not cool. I am cooked!

04:27.558 --> 04:31.354
What does he have on you?
Nothing, right? You're the best.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.648
Yeah, nothing. No need to panic.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.149
[screams]

04:36.150 --> 04:41.030
Is there some secret you don't remember?
Like a booger ball you've been hiding

04:41.114 --> 04:45.451
in your dresser drawer for...
no reason or something?

04:45.535 --> 04:48.746
When Mega Fat worked for me,
I gave him plenty of secrets.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.916
But we were friends.
They were all good secrets.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.669
Secret: put a blankie under your desk,

04:54.752 --> 04:56.921
and no one will ever know
you're power napping.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.048
Oh, hoo, hoo!

04:59.132 --> 05:02.468
Secret: want stronger coffee?
Add seven or eight extra scoops

05:02.552 --> 05:04.887
when Office Manager Baby Barb
isn't looking.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.639
[slurps] Oh, whoo!

05:06.723 --> 05:09.600
Giddy-up, baby! Yeehaw! What!

05:09.684 --> 05:12.645
Secret: learn to change
your own diaper one-handed

05:12.729 --> 05:14.772
and you'll never have to interrupt
another call.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.024
Ooh. Ooh!

05:17.608 --> 05:18.443
Ooh!

05:19.319 --> 05:23.031
[baby] Did you just change your diaper
on the phone with me?

05:23.114 --> 05:24.157
No.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.869
[both laughing]

05:27.952 --> 05:31.331
And then, one day, he betrayed me.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.083
Well, what happened?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.377
-[monitor chiming]
-Hold that thought. Any luck, Frankie?

05:36.461 --> 05:40.381
Dead end. No idea where Mega Fat
would keep secret evidence.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.508
Ah, I knew it was a long shot. Thanks.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.344
I mean, there's that secret vault
in his office behind the bookcase.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.807
The one he keeps putting things into
and laughing all evil like... [laughs]

05:49.891 --> 05:51.184
But that's too obvious, right?

05:51.267 --> 05:54.896
Secret vault behind the bookcase?
Outstanding work, Frankie.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.564
Sorry I can't help. Bye.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.774
All right, Templeton.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.068
-We need to stop Bootsy, right?
-Absolutely.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.528
But if Mega Fat's secret dirt
gets me fired,

06:02.612 --> 06:04.864
we lose access to all of Baby Corp's
resources...

06:04.947 --> 06:07.825
-And then we can't stop Bootsy.
-Oh, you're a natural, kid.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.244
So tonight, while Mom and Dad sleep,

06:10.328 --> 06:13.122
we are going to break in
and rob Mega Fat's vault.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.541
Whoa, I thought we were the good guys.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.795
Breaking in, robbing,
sneaking out of the house after dark,

06:18.878 --> 06:20.755
that's bad guy stuff. Hey!

06:20.838 --> 06:23.591
Ah, the latest issue
of Centipedeor: Unleashed.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.677
I didn't read this one yet.
Tell me, Templeton, what happened

06:26.761 --> 06:29.931
after the villainous Dark Swatter
completed his mega Earth zapper?

06:30.014 --> 06:33.643
Well, first, Centipedeor stole
the Army's secret LaserChopper.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.521
[laughing]

06:36.604 --> 06:39.023
Tally-ho to the chase, Ladybug Lad.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.651
You'd think a hero named after
a hundred-legged bug

06:41.734 --> 06:43.861
wouldn't need a helicopter
to catch a villain on foot,

06:43.945 --> 06:45.446
but, sure, I'll suspend disbelief.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.574
[Dark Swatter] Is that all you've "swat"?
[laughs]

06:48.658 --> 06:52.161
I'll get you, Dark Swatter,
no matter the cost.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.997
Well, I calculate over two million dollars
in property damage.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.624
[Dark Swatter laughing]

06:56.707 --> 06:58.543
-[trigger beeps]
-[Dark Swatter screams]

06:58.626 --> 07:00.336
Oh, well, make that 80 million.

07:01.671 --> 07:07.301
I do what I gotta do to save the planet.
I am Centipedeor Unleashed.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.721
Then I assume the police come arrest you
for destroying half the city?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.265
What? No.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.976
Centipedeor gets a medal
from the president.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.854
He only destroyed the city
to save the world.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.730
Oh.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.065
Don't you see?

07:21.149 --> 07:24.152
You can do whatever you want
so long as it's for the greater good.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.822
Break into vaults, smash stuff,
stay out all night without permission.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.117
I never get to stay out all night
or smash stuff.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.744
But if it's for the greater good...

07:33.828 --> 07:36.289
We have to do bad stuff to save your job

07:36.372 --> 07:38.416
so we can save the town
from Bootsy Calico.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.336
Yes! Welcome to the magical world
of gray area rationalization.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.591
Welcome to Tim Templeton... Unleashed.

Noble scoundrel, first things first:
if we're staying out all night,

07:50.094 --> 07:53.139
we need to make sure Mom and Dad
don't wake up and find us gone.

Well, they're not waking up.

-Jimbo, where have you been?
-Sorry, I couldn't find my chupie.

So I looked and looked
and found a different chupie,

that I lost. I miss that chupie so much.

back when we were friends.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.950
-[Phil howling]
-[Tim gasps]

11:00.493 --> 11:03.996
-Phil's coming!
-I'm reminiscing as fast as I can.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.874
One, two, tee-hee-hee.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.544
I love it.
Your talent is so inspiring, Boss Baby.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.589
So I actually doodled a little poster
of my own.

11:13.672 --> 11:17.968
Oh, initiative.
The pedals on the tricycle called success.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.554
-What is that?
-It's one for teens.

11:20.638 --> 11:25.101
You know, teenagers love putting posters
of cool people on their walls.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.811
Why not cool babies?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.063
[laughs]

11:29.146 --> 11:31.357
Brilliant. One for teens.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.402
-You like it?
-Remember this day, Mega Fat Intern Baby.

11:34.485 --> 11:38.406
This is the day you got
your first executive gold star.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.448
Oh! [panting]

11:39.532 --> 11:40.991
Oh, boy! I love it!

11:41.075 --> 11:43.702
-Here's to one for teens.
-One for teens.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.579
[both] One for teens!

11:46.080 --> 11:47.456
One for teens.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.791
One-fourteen.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.709
[lock beeps, clicks]

11:52.211 --> 11:54.213
[grunts, snarls]

11:55.965 --> 11:58.217
[Phil howls]

11:58.300 --> 12:01.846
And then, one day, he betrayed me.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.349
Anyway... we're in.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.810
Now let's move this bookshelf,
open the secret vault,

12:07.893 --> 12:10.813
steal Mega Fat's dirt on you
and skedaddle.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.446
-Wait. I just need a moment.
-I thought you didn't want to get caught.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.824
Super early morning shift starts in...
four hours?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.118
We're doing pretty good on time, actually.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.287
"Tomorrow, get Boss Baby fired."

12:26.620 --> 12:28.789
[sighs] There was a time
he'd have given me

12:28.873 --> 12:30.916
the diaper off his own derriere.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.419
Now, just constant betrayal.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.088
Hey, can I rub my naked butt
all over his desk?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.048
-What?
-Double-cheeking the desk

12:38.132 --> 12:40.718
of a baby who's mean to my brother,
it's what unleashed guys do.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.636
-Do it!
-I'm touched,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.973
but I have to say,
I'm uneasy about this side of you.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.767
You've always been my moral compass.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.060
Do you wanna rub your naked butt
on his desk?

12:50.144 --> 12:53.022
Yes, more than anything. I need this. Go!

12:55.858 --> 12:56.859
[laughs]

12:56.942 --> 13:00.946
You like that,
notebook with plans to fire me, don't you?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.782
Take that, part of the telephone
where your mouth goes--

13:03.866 --> 13:05.409
Whoa! Not that unleashed.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.788
Red alert from Jimbo!
Magnus just showed up to work.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.247
In the middle of the night?

13:10.331 --> 13:14.043
Hey, gotta keep his Employee of the Month
streak alive somehow.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.545
We're almost to the vault. Jimbo!

13:16.629 --> 13:19.548
-Can you keep him busy?
-But he's gonna recognize me.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.177
[whistles tune]

13:23.969 --> 13:24.803
[Jimbo gasps]

13:25.471 --> 13:26.680
[Jimbo chuckles]

13:26.764 --> 13:28.766
Nothing gets past me.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.768
You don't say.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.064
And this is some outstanding
janitorial work.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.899
I commend you.

13:38.442 --> 13:42.196
-Good evening, Security Baby Phil!
-[Phil] My ears!

13:42.279 --> 13:43.989
He's headed your way!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.409
[sniffing]

13:47.993 --> 13:51.038
I sense something amiss.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.423
Aha!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.760
Unfinished paperwork!

14:05.928 --> 14:08.806
This ends here.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.601
Buy low, sell high. Merger, merger!

14:12.685 --> 14:15.312
I have never felt so alive!

14:22.486 --> 14:26.490
Quarterly financial report, kapow!

14:26.907 --> 14:27.741
[door opens, closes]

14:28.659 --> 14:30.995
[screams, grunts]

14:32.329 --> 14:36.375
Say what you will about that baby,
his paperwork is transcendent.

14:36.458 --> 14:41.088
Super early shift starts in half an hour.
We better open this secret vault.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.216
[grunting]

14:44.300 --> 14:45.801
Man-baby, pushies!

14:46.927 --> 14:49.054
Tim Templeton Unleashed.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.264
[both grunting]

14:50.347 --> 14:53.058
Baby furniture is way lighter
than you think.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.312
No combination? Is it unlocked?

14:56.395 --> 14:57.897
-[handle buzzing]
-[laughing]

14:57.980 --> 14:59.023
It tickles.

14:59.106 --> 15:02.735
I think Tim Templeton Unleashed
can handle a little...

15:02.818 --> 15:04.987
-[handle buzzing]
-[laughing]

15:05.070 --> 15:07.072
Whoa, that is tickly.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.033
Of course.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.035
You're doing a bang-up job.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.620
-[buzzing]
-[laughing] Ooh!

15:12.703 --> 15:15.789
-You got me good.
-Office high jinks, buddy.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.541
I love high jinks.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.501
-[buzzes]
-[laughing]

15:19.585 --> 15:21.253
-Gotcha, buddy.
-[chuckles]

15:21.378 --> 15:22.504
Hey, high jinks.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.382
[chuckles] What a card.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.969
How do I turn this off?
I'm starving. Hello?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.346
[cackles]

15:30.471 --> 15:32.097
Please? I'm so hungry.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.224
[laughs]

15:34.350 --> 15:35.726
I'll get you for this.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.394
[stapler buzzing]

15:38.312 --> 15:40.731
Gotcha, bud--
Okay, why is there no giggling?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.817
I practiced over and over at home
until I felt nothing.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.403
No more high jinks on this guy. I win.

15:46.487 --> 15:50.699
Wow, I'd hate to get
on your bad side, BFF.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.787
But then, one day, he betrayed me.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.332
-Are you ever going to say what actually--
-This is an endurance lock.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.752
Only Mega Fat can stand the tickle,
so only he can open it.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.797
If daycare taught me anything,
it's incredible tolerance for--

16:04.880 --> 16:08.842
No. I created this monster.
This is my battle.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.306
-[handle buzzing]
-[laughing]

16:19.269 --> 16:20.938
[coughing]

16:21.021 --> 16:22.773
[groans]

16:22.856 --> 16:25.818
-Look at that.
-It's a big stack of pictures.

16:25.901 --> 16:29.029
-The secret!
-He's got dirt on everyone.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.115
Worker Baby Amal eating pencils.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.075
Hendershot drinking from Peg's bottle.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.327
Peg dunking Hendershot's bottle
in the toilet--

16:35.411 --> 16:38.038
Oh, I wish I hadn't seen that. [gasps]

16:38.122 --> 16:42.459
-Did you find the dirt on you?
-Get Jimbo in here... now.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.379
[Jimbo grunts]

16:46.255 --> 16:47.089
[whimpers]

16:47.798 --> 16:50.384
Is this why you've been running late?

16:50.467 --> 16:53.345
You've been carrying on with that pet cat?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.680
[grunts]

16:54.763 --> 16:56.724
We're fighting to stop Bootsy
and his kittens

16:56.807 --> 16:59.935
from plunging the world into chaos,
and you're petting one?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.271
-What have you told her?
-Nothing!

17:02.354 --> 17:06.191
Gwendolyn's a good kitty.
So soft and friendly.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.318
You disgust me!

17:08.402 --> 17:10.362
Guys, what's this?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.036
[gasps]

17:20.372 --> 17:23.876
How is that a secret?
I see that poster everywhere.

17:23.959 --> 17:28.505
I-- I know what this is.
A reminder of the day he betrayed me.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.798
Finally!

17:32.342 --> 17:33.260
[laughs]

17:33.343 --> 17:34.803
Look how silly.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.389
It's cute and disturbing!

17:37.473 --> 17:39.433
-Like me. [laughs]
-Hey!

17:39.558 --> 17:43.312
-What's all the fuss about?
-Oh, no biggie. Just crushing it.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.732
A cat poster?
How will this increase baby love?

17:46.815 --> 17:48.275
It neutralizes the enemy.

17:48.358 --> 17:52.571
[chuckles] Who would want a cat
when they see how silly they are?

17:52.654 --> 17:55.240
Not our concern. It should be a baby.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.953
-Presentation time?
-Uh, no, buddy. You stay put.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.999
-I thought we were a team.
-We are, but I'm still the boss.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.670
Ever feel like you've had a bad day
that couldn't get any worse?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.839
Well, hang in there, baby.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.176
[all whispering]

18:14.593 --> 18:18.305
I'm sorry, but we feel this poster
makes babies look foolish.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.933
This may actually decrease baby love.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.520
-Uh, that was the intern's idea.
-[gasps]

18:24.603 --> 18:29.733
My idea was, we make cats look foolish.
You know, neutralize the enemy.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.152
Good idea.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.154
[all cheering]

18:34.238 --> 18:35.155
Yes.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
-Right on.
-Very nice.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.200
Great job.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.410
Hmm. [growls]

18:41.120 --> 18:42.704
The poster was huge.

18:42.788 --> 18:47.501
It made a significant dent in cat love,
turning cats into a joke for millions.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.587
You took all the credit. You betrayed him.

18:50.671 --> 18:56.009
[gasps] You're not Ladybug Lad.
You're Dark Swatter. You're the bad guy.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.262
Yeah, wow, I really remembered that wrong.

18:58.345 --> 19:02.891
Whoopsy doodly doo.
I guess we all make mistakes.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.228
Mega Fat CEO Baby.
I should've known this was a trap.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.522
Sorry not sorry for this goose chase.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.900
I wanted you to remember the betrayal
that inspired me to rise

19:11.984 --> 19:15.362
to the tippy tippy top,
just so I could crush you.

19:15.445 --> 19:19.533
It feels so good.
Phil, seize their chupies.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.326
Grr!

19:24.663 --> 19:25.539
[spits]

19:26.999 --> 19:30.169
I'm sorry about the poster,
but we were besties once.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.753
We can try again.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.548
Nothing's more important
than stopping Bootsy Calico.

19:34.631 --> 19:39.094
-You cannot fire me at a time like this.
-Who said anything about firing you?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.638
I said you'd never work here again.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.182
[line ringing]

19:43.265 --> 19:45.475
Hello. Ted and Janice Templeton?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.393
[both gasp]

19:46.476 --> 19:48.645
-Have you checked the children?
-[Mom snores, screams]

19:48.729 --> 19:51.398
What? Ted, where are the kids?
What time is it?

19:51.481 --> 19:53.650
-Hang in there, baby.
-Oh, no.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.987
-We need to get home now.
-Can I be unleashed now?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.947
-You don't need my permission.
-[screams]

20:01.241 --> 20:03.202
-[Staci grunts]
-[Phil panting, grunting]

20:03.285 --> 20:04.953
[both grunting]

20:05.537 --> 20:06.705
-[Jimbo] Hello!
-[both gasp]

20:06.788 --> 20:08.707
-[both whimpering]
-Ah!

20:09.291 --> 20:12.169
-Take the chupies. Go!
-To the elevators, Templeton!

20:13.921 --> 20:17.299
-How long do we have to sit here?
-I'd say... right now.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.593
-[stapler buzzing]
-[laughing]

20:19.676 --> 20:20.969
[Staci screams, grunts]

20:21.053 --> 20:24.681
Slow them down.
Give Mommy and Daddy time to really worry.

20:24.765 --> 20:28.018
-Come on, come on, come on!
-How long do you think we have?

20:28.101 --> 20:30.854
If they're still groggy,
two minutes, tops. We can make it.

20:30.938 --> 20:31.772
[Tim gasps]

20:31.855 --> 20:33.273
[Phil grunting]

20:33.357 --> 20:34.691
[elevator bell dings]

20:37.194 --> 20:38.779
Oof! [groans]

20:38.862 --> 20:41.156
Nice knowing you, Boss Baby.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.910
Staci's room? Blast!
I've got Staci's chupie.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.162
Jimbo's room. Ah, I've got Jimbo's chupie.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.710
-Head for the back. We can climb.
-No time.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.255
We have to try the front door,
and hope they haven't...

20:56.338 --> 20:57.464
[both gasp]

20:57.547 --> 20:59.424
-[whimpering]
-[gasps]

20:59.508 --> 21:00.759
I found them!

21:01.260 --> 21:03.553
-Where were you?
-Oh, thank goodness.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.682
We are never letting you two
out of our sight again.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.351
Never, ever, never, never, never.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.561
[elevator bell dings]

21:14.356 --> 21:15.399
Oh.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.902
You two are so busted right now.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.153
-[elevator bell dings]
-Ooh!

21:20.237 --> 21:23.824
The super early shift
is starting super-duper early today.

21:23.907 --> 21:28.620
Well, well, welly,
well, wellsy, wellaby, well, well, well.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.498
What the hoo ha?

21:31.581 --> 21:34.126
Hey, that's my lost chupie!

21:34.209 --> 21:36.920
[chuckles] That's right,
big chunky baby boy.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.090
I'd like you to meet well-placed kitten
number six.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.760
Actually, I believe
you're already acquainted.

21:43.844 --> 21:49.141
You see, I placed this kitty
in your heart.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.809
-[meows]
-Gwendolyn?

21:50.892 --> 21:54.187
My chupie wasn't lost. You stole it!

21:54.271 --> 21:56.315
-[meows]
-Phil, seize him!

21:56.398 --> 21:57.274
Ah!

21:58.483 --> 22:00.402
[all meowing]

22:00.485 --> 22:02.571
[Phil] The meowing. Too loud!

22:02.654 --> 22:04.990
Mad Dog's getting beat by cats!

22:06.283 --> 22:09.411
So this is Baby Corp.
