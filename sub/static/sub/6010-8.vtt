00:36.125 --> 00:40.844
I think it's held up very well,
all things considered.

00:40.845 --> 00:42.844
Especially after all that rain.

00:42.845 --> 00:44.684
How's the house team coming on?

00:44.685 --> 00:48.724
Because we're taking this
very seriously in the village.

00:48.725 --> 00:52.204
Nobody takes it more seriously
than his lordship, Dad,

00:52.205 --> 00:54.004
whatever he likes to pretend.

00:54.005 --> 00:58.084
Mr Bates has had his rest now
and wants to get back to work.

00:58.085 --> 01:02.845
It's time to draw a line under
this whole unfortunate episode.

01:04.285 --> 01:05.965
So I go out the window.

01:06.885 --> 01:12.124
I cannot hide that I find
your situation revolting.

01:12.125 --> 01:17.524
But, whether or not you believe me,
I am not entirely unsympathetic.

01:17.525 --> 01:21.524
You have been twisted by nature
into something foul,

01:21.525 --> 01:24.884
and even I can see
that you did not ask for it.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.844
I think it better
that you resign, quietly,

01:28.845 --> 01:32.844
citing the excuse
that Mr Bates has returned.

01:32.845 --> 01:36.244
I will write
a perfectly acceptable reference

01:36.245 --> 01:40.565
and you'll find that there's nothing
about it that's hard to explain.

01:41.765 --> 01:43.365
I see.

01:44.285 --> 01:45.724
What about tonight?

01:45.941 --> 01:47.580
It's nearly time to change,

01:47.581 --> 01:51.101
so you should dress him tonight
and let Mr Bates take over tomorrow.

02:00.021 --> 02:03.380
I'm not foul, Mr Carson.

02:03.381 --> 02:06.940
I'm not the same as you,
but I'm not foul.

02:06.941 --> 02:08.941
Yes, well...

02:10.420 --> 02:12.661
We've spoken enough on this subject.

02:13.261 --> 02:15.901
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll ring the gong.

02:21.301 --> 02:24.820
Come along, Miss O'Brien.
Stop eavesdropping and do some work.

02:24.821 --> 02:26.421
I don't know what you...

02:30.301 --> 02:34.220
How are you getting on
with the cricket team?
We should be all right.

02:34.221 --> 02:37.420
We've still got Thomas, thank God.
Won't he be leaving soon?

02:37.421 --> 02:40.500
Not before the match,
if I've got anything to do with it.

02:40.501 --> 02:44.100
One of the gardeners told Anna
their team is in terrific shape.

02:44.101 --> 02:47.140
It's so unfair the outside staff
play for the village.

02:47.141 --> 02:50.780
Why don't you support the house
AND the village? You own both.

02:50.781 --> 02:53.500
But I'm captain of the house team.

02:53.501 --> 02:57.020
If I were you I'd be captain
of the village. They always win.

02:57.021 --> 03:00.460
Not always.
Usually, but not always.

03:00.461 --> 03:02.580
Mary, you look
as if you're in a trance.

03:02.581 --> 03:05.100
What were you doing in London?
It's worn you out.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.101
Maybe. I'll try and rest tomorrow.

03:11.221 --> 03:12.980
Crikey.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.461
I'd better go.
Before you do,

03:14.462 --> 03:18.500
a little bird tells me
Mr Carson has made up his mind
to deal with Thomas after all.

03:18.501 --> 03:19.940
It's about time.

03:19.941 --> 03:24.340
If you want to register your anger
at how Thomas treated you,
now is the hour.

03:24.341 --> 03:28.180
I'm not sure. I'm still disgusted
by the whole thing, obviously.

03:28.181 --> 03:29.621
Obviously.

03:30.701 --> 03:32.340
But if you don't speak out,

03:32.341 --> 03:35.061
people might think
you weren't disgusted at all.

03:36.421 --> 03:39.101
Now you must excuse me.
I ought to be upstairs.

03:43.381 --> 03:45.260
Anna! What are you doing out here?

03:45.261 --> 03:49.100
Her ladyship's with Lady Mary, sir.
I'm afraid she's going to be late.

03:49.101 --> 03:50.701
Let me see what's happening.

03:51.701 --> 03:55.060
You couldn't be in better hands
than Dr Ryder's, truly.

03:55.061 --> 03:57.300
I hope to God you're right.

03:57.301 --> 04:01.581
Anna's worried you're getting late.
Heavens, you made me jump.

04:02.901 --> 04:05.101
I must go. O'Brien will scold me.

04:07.301 --> 04:08.660
Anna?

04:08.661 --> 04:11.141
What were you talking about?
Nothing.

04:11.661 --> 04:13.661
Women's stuff.

04:14.781 --> 04:19.300
Your ears must have been burning
earlier. Papa was discussing
the cricket match.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.779
The village thrashed us last year.

04:21.781 --> 04:24.820
I suppose I'll have to play.
You suppose right.

04:24.821 --> 04:28.301
Because of last year he's absolutely
determined to win this time.

04:30.701 --> 04:33.700
Bates must count himself lucky
to be out of it.

04:33.701 --> 04:36.020
I think he'd like
to walk normally, sir,

04:36.021 --> 04:38.980
even if playing cricket
was the price he had to pay.

04:38.981 --> 04:41.740
Of course he would. I'm so sorry.
That was stupid of me.

04:41.741 --> 04:44.621
It's quite all right, sir.
I was only joking.

04:46.461 --> 04:50.500
Oh, there's no question
that some people have a feel for it.

04:50.501 --> 04:53.060
I think cricket's
like anything else.

04:53.061 --> 04:55.300
When you learn it as a child,

04:55.301 --> 04:58.620
there's an understanding
that is hard to come by later.

04:58.621 --> 05:01.660
And with a father like mine...

05:01.661 --> 05:03.980
I was brought up
with cricket in my blood.

05:03.981 --> 05:09.340
Why have you never played in a match
before? How could I? I didn't work
at the house until this year.

05:09.341 --> 05:11.740
I could hardly play
for the village team.

05:11.741 --> 05:14.180
We'll have to start
a fan club, won't we?

05:14.181 --> 05:17.620
That's kind, Ivy, but I just
want to do my best for the house.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.260
That's all the reward I seek.

05:19.261 --> 05:22.381
Your modesty is an example
to us all, Mr Molesley.

05:31.381 --> 05:34.300
What is that you're so glued to?
This week's column.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.180
I've got to send it off tomorrow.
What's it about?

05:37.181 --> 05:40.820
The poor soldiers. How many are
reduced to begging on the streets.

05:40.821 --> 05:44.380
And some officers are working
as dance partners in nightclubs.

05:44.381 --> 05:49.540
After the trenches, even the Embassy
Club must seem an improvement.
You shouldn't make fun of them.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.821
She's forgetting that you were
in the trenches and she wasn't.

05:53.861 --> 05:58.900
She must be 18 by now.
Little Rose, 18? Yes. How scary!

05:58.901 --> 05:59.940
Hello.

05:59.941 --> 06:02.780
It's quite a responsibility.
Well, I couldn't say no.

06:02.781 --> 06:08.220
Her mother is my niece
and my godchild, and she
asked it as a special favour.

06:08.221 --> 06:11.661
Apparently, she hates London.

06:12.381 --> 06:15.140
And they can't get to Scotland
until July.

06:15.141 --> 06:19.900
Poor Shrimpie. His work
keeps him nailed to his desk.

06:19.901 --> 06:25.660
She hates London, so she's coming
to a great-aunt in Yorkshire
to have a good time? Mm-hm.

06:25.661 --> 06:27.620
How original.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.260
Don't be silly. Of course you will.
No, I won't.

06:30.261 --> 06:33.580
I'd like to help but I've never
played a game of cricket in my life.

06:33.581 --> 06:36.220
Oddly, the game was never
a part of my childhood.

06:36.221 --> 06:39.260
Didn't you play last year?
No, nor the year before that.

06:39.261 --> 06:42.420
The fact is I've never played
cricket. But couldn't you try?

06:42.421 --> 06:46.581
Robert! Stop being such a bully.
Let's just have a nice dinner.

06:55.421 --> 06:58.260
I'm afraid I've heard
Mr Carson's going to let him off.

06:58.261 --> 07:01.620
What can I do about it?
Say you won't tolerate it.

07:01.621 --> 07:05.300
Unless he's going to give him a bad
reference, you'll tell the police.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.580
I couldn't do that. Could I?
Why not?

07:08.581 --> 07:10.460
And won't you have to,

07:10.461 --> 07:14.100
if you don't want folk to think
there's something funny about you?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.341
It's a good job
that's supposed to be eaten cold.

07:24.901 --> 07:28.340
Are you sure about Rose? Wouldn't
it be better if she stayed here?

07:28.341 --> 07:31.020
No, no, no.
I'm quite looking forward to it.

07:31.021 --> 07:35.860
I couldn't manage an 18-year-old
these days. I wouldn't know
what she was talking about.

07:35.861 --> 07:37.740
My husband was a great traveller,

07:37.741 --> 07:41.420
so I've spent many happy evenings
without understanding a word.

07:41.421 --> 07:43.900
The thing is to keep smiling

07:43.901 --> 07:46.661
and never look as if you disapprove.

07:50.941 --> 07:54.340
So, Bates, I'll see you
on duty tomorrow.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.580
Good night, Barrow. You do know
I wish you every good fortune?

07:57.581 --> 07:59.421
I believe so. Thank you, m'lord.

08:10.581 --> 08:12.461
To the victor the spoils.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.420
What will you do?
Oh, what's it to you?

08:15.421 --> 08:19.301
You're right. It's nothing to me.

08:25.141 --> 08:29.380
If we can buy out Simpson
and Tucker, quite a chunk
of the estate will be back in hand.

08:29.381 --> 08:31.221
We'll be operating a real business.

08:31.222 --> 08:34.500
That's why I think the cricket
may have come at rather a good time.

08:34.501 --> 08:38.539
Why? Because you think if you get
a few runs and catch someone out,

08:38.541 --> 08:40.900
Papa will accept all this gladly?

08:40.900 --> 08:42.740
I think the cricket will show him

08:42.741 --> 08:46.020
it doesn't mean we can't keep up
the old traditions as well.

08:46.021 --> 08:48.140
And I'm to help persuade him?

08:48.141 --> 08:51.061
Of course. You're on MY team now.

09:02.301 --> 09:05.140
You can kiss me, but that's it.

09:05.141 --> 09:06.900
Why? Haven't you missed me?

09:06.901 --> 09:08.540
Desperately.

09:08.541 --> 09:11.861
But... London seems
to have tired me out.

09:27.021 --> 09:28.460
Come.

09:28.461 --> 09:31.981
Mr Carson,
is it true Mr Barrow's leaving?

09:32.661 --> 09:35.660
Yes, and...

09:35.661 --> 09:37.940
for what it's worth,

09:37.941 --> 09:42.620
I think he was genuinely mistaken
over the, er... incident,

09:42.621 --> 09:45.380
and he's sorry now,
which, of course, is no excuse.

09:45.381 --> 09:48.940
I want to be sure
you'll give him a bad reference.

09:48.941 --> 09:51.180
I'm sorry?

09:51.181 --> 09:54.900
I can't let a man like that go
to work in innocent people's houses.

09:54.901 --> 09:57.820
I will write him the character
I think he deserves.

09:57.821 --> 10:01.540
Can I read it?
Certainly not!

10:01.541 --> 10:05.260
Because I've been thinking...
I ought to report him to the police.

10:05.261 --> 10:07.300
What?
It's my duty.

10:07.301 --> 10:10.860
I know today thinking is much
more liberal. Now, just a minute.

10:10.861 --> 10:14.741
I've never been called a liberal
in my life and I don't intend
to start now.

10:15.381 --> 10:18.661
But I do not believe in scandal.

10:19.621 --> 10:24.060
Mr Barrow will go, and when he does
I would like him to go quietly,

10:24.061 --> 10:26.140
for the sake of the house,
the family,

10:26.141 --> 10:28.141
and, for that matter, you.

10:30.141 --> 10:32.100
I'm sorry, Mr Carson,

10:32.101 --> 10:35.740
but I can't stay quiet if my
conscience prompts me differently.

10:35.741 --> 10:38.341
I won't turn a blind eye to sin.

11:20.812 --> 11:23.851
I've asked Ethel
to bring us some coffee.

11:23.852 --> 11:27.651
Oh, I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
My mother doesn't approve.

11:27.652 --> 11:30.291
Would you like something else?
Absolutely not.

11:30.292 --> 11:32.851
After all, she won't find out
unless you tell her.

11:32.852 --> 11:36.291
How is Lady Flintshire?
Incredibly busy.

11:36.292 --> 11:38.291
Daddy works harder than a slave,

11:38.292 --> 11:41.051
so she has to manage
everything else by herself.

11:41.052 --> 11:43.252
I doubt he works
harder than a slave.

11:43.972 --> 11:46.491
Cousin Isobel is very literal.

11:46.492 --> 11:49.412
Now I have something for you.

11:55.092 --> 11:56.851
Shall I pour, ma'am?

11:56.852 --> 11:58.772
No, thank you. I'll do it.

12:02.812 --> 12:04.331
These.

12:04.332 --> 12:07.452
The first answers
to the advertisement.

12:09.292 --> 12:13.651
Cousin Violet is trying
to find a new job for my cook.

12:13.652 --> 12:15.532
That sounds rather inconvenient.

12:16.772 --> 12:20.931
Cousin Violet has never let a matter
of convenience stand in the way
of a principle.

12:20.932 --> 12:22.892
As the kettle said to the pot.

12:27.612 --> 12:29.972
I'm to leave with no reference?

12:31.092 --> 12:33.012
After working here for ten years?

12:33.772 --> 12:35.731
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

12:35.732 --> 12:38.132
I'll never get a job now, Mr Carson.

12:39.932 --> 12:43.051
Does his lordship know about this?
No.

12:43.052 --> 12:44.611
Then I'm going to tell him.

12:44.612 --> 12:48.492
And how would you do that
without telling him the rest of it?

12:53.492 --> 12:56.732
This wasn't Jimmy's idea.
Somebody's put him up to it.

12:57.772 --> 13:00.731
He wouldn't be so unkind,
not left to himself.

13:00.732 --> 13:04.931
I'm almost touched that you will
defend him under such circumstances,

13:04.932 --> 13:07.852
but... there it is.

13:09.772 --> 13:15.332
Well, can I stay here
for a day or two while I...
come up with some sort of plan?

13:17.532 --> 13:20.091
Yes, I think I can allow that.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.452
But that's the best I can do.

13:26.132 --> 13:28.612
Thank you, Mr Carson.

13:33.692 --> 13:35.692
At least it doesn't smell damp.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.812
I think it's nice.

13:39.812 --> 13:42.331
Or it will be
when it's got a lick of paint.

13:42.332 --> 13:44.132
I can do that.

13:45.132 --> 13:46.491
I can.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.131
You're not climbing any ladders.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.811
But yes,

13:50.812 --> 13:53.891
together I think we can make it
really comfy.

13:53.892 --> 13:55.931
What do they call extreme optimism?

13:55.932 --> 13:58.451
They call it
making the best of things.

13:58.452 --> 14:00.452
And that is what we will do.

14:02.572 --> 14:05.492
You being in this room
is enough to make it nice.

14:07.572 --> 14:09.652
Come here.

14:18.652 --> 14:22.051
We should think of some things to do
while you're here.

14:22.052 --> 14:26.171
Edith, you should take Rose
to Whitby market on Wednesday.
She'd enjoy that.

14:26.172 --> 14:28.771
I can't.
I'm going to London on Wednesday.

14:28.772 --> 14:30.571
Oh! Well, could I come?

14:30.572 --> 14:32.931
Oh, but you've only just got here.

14:32.932 --> 14:36.971
I thought you hated London.
Who told you that? Susan!

14:36.972 --> 14:39.531
Oh, darling Mummy.

14:39.532 --> 14:44.291
Well, should I correct her?
Oh, no. She's right, really, but...

14:44.292 --> 14:46.451
I'm planning a surprise for her

14:46.452 --> 14:48.691
and I need to go to London
to arrange it.

14:48.692 --> 14:50.531
You won't give me away, will you?

14:50.532 --> 14:54.412
Won't you stay with your parents?
I can't. It would spoil everything.

14:55.692 --> 14:57.051
You can stay with me.

14:57.052 --> 14:59.971
Aunt Rosamund won't mind,
and there's plenty of room.

14:59.972 --> 15:04.852
I don't even know where you're
going. To see my editor,
to discuss my article.

15:08.172 --> 15:10.411
I think I might
come up with you to London.

15:10.412 --> 15:13.731
I'll ring the office in the morning.
I can stay at my club.

15:13.732 --> 15:17.131
Don't do that. Aunt Rosamund
would love to have you.

15:17.132 --> 15:21.451
And... I suspect I'll need help
controlling Rose.

15:21.452 --> 15:24.811
Why do you say that? I'm not sure.

15:24.812 --> 15:26.771
Instinct.

15:26.772 --> 15:30.211
When your mother finds out, will
she mind? No, she'll be delighted.

15:30.212 --> 15:33.451
And so grateful to all of you
for helping with my secret.

15:33.452 --> 15:37.332
Besides, with Edith as my chaperone,
what harm can I come to?

15:39.812 --> 15:41.651
But how can I help?

15:41.652 --> 15:45.371
If our plan works, we'll be farming
a third of the estate directly.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.811
And you can manage that?
We think so.

15:47.812 --> 15:51.491
But we need you to think so too,
because Lord Grantham
definitely won't.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.411
Are you drawing up
the battle lines? Poor Robert.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.212
The post-war world
has not been kind to him.

15:59.212 --> 16:01.491
How are you getting on
with the agent's house?

16:01.492 --> 16:04.531
I hope Jarvis didn't leave it
a wreck. No, not at all.

16:04.532 --> 16:08.771
But the furniture was his,
so I'll have to begin
in a state of Trappist simplicity.

16:08.772 --> 16:12.451
I'm sure there's some stuff in
the attics here. We'll have a look.

16:12.452 --> 16:13.891
What about Sybbie?

16:13.892 --> 16:15.531
Won't it be lonely for her,

16:15.532 --> 16:18.451
just you and Nanny
and nobody else for company?

16:18.452 --> 16:20.852
I think it's right for both of us.

16:24.012 --> 16:25.852
Mr Barrow?

16:28.172 --> 16:30.572
What in heaven's name
are you doing out here?

16:36.332 --> 16:41.691
I know you're leaving, but things
can't be as black as all that.

16:41.692 --> 16:45.971
You're trained now. You can apply
for a position as a butler.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.171
You don't know everything, then?

16:48.172 --> 16:50.771
Then will you tell me everything?

16:50.772 --> 16:54.771
I'm afraid if I dare do,
Mrs Hughes, that...

16:54.772 --> 16:57.371
it will shock and disgust you.

16:57.372 --> 17:02.811
Shock and disgust? My, my.
I think I have to hear it now.

17:02.812 --> 17:04.612
Come on.

17:08.372 --> 17:10.531
Lady Grantham -
the dowager, that is...

17:10.531 --> 17:14.692
has been concerned that your history
here has left you lonely.

17:15.811 --> 17:19.531
She's kind to concern herself.
It's not just that.

17:20.452 --> 17:25.291
She believes you've made this house
a local topic of unwelcome
conversation.

17:26.172 --> 17:27.531
Ah.

17:27.531 --> 17:30.451
So she's placed
an advertisement for you

17:30.452 --> 17:33.332
and she's got some replies.

17:35.332 --> 17:39.491
The point is, you would go to your
new position with references from me

17:39.492 --> 17:41.051
and from Mrs Hughes

17:41.052 --> 17:43.771
and you would not have to refer
to your earlier life.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.292
In effect, you'd be washed clean.

17:49.932 --> 17:51.731
Yes?

17:51.732 --> 17:54.931
Is the new maid working out?
No, not really.

17:54.932 --> 17:57.051
I don't think she'll stay.

17:57.052 --> 17:58.571
I miss Anna.

17:58.572 --> 18:00.651
What do you call her
now she's your maid?

18:00.652 --> 18:02.691
Anna, I'm afraid.

18:02.692 --> 18:04.812
I can't very well call her Bates.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.371
No.

18:07.372 --> 18:09.571
What's this about?

18:09.572 --> 18:11.091
Well...

18:11.092 --> 18:14.131
You know Matthew wants
to come with you to London.

18:14.132 --> 18:15.891
Why shouldn't he?

18:15.892 --> 18:19.451
I just need to check which train
you're planning to come back on.

18:19.452 --> 18:21.852
The three o'clock on Thursday. Why?

18:22.892 --> 18:25.891
Can you promise not to let him
catch an earlier one?

18:25.892 --> 18:28.492
Of course not.
What reason would I give?

18:29.132 --> 18:31.612
You can think of something.
Please.

18:32.092 --> 18:33.611
Oh, all right.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.092
But why is everything
always so complicated?

18:41.452 --> 18:45.211
We'll talk about it when
Matthew's back from London.
Can't I have a clue?

18:45.212 --> 18:49.171
He should tell you. It's his idea.
God, it sounds ominous. What does?

18:49.172 --> 18:54.051
Matthew has some ghastly scheme for
the estate and Tom's too frightened
to say what it is.

18:54.052 --> 18:56.052
I need a drink.

18:58.332 --> 19:01.172
You cannot allow him
to blackmail you like this.

19:01.852 --> 19:06.011
And before you ask,
Thomas has told me the whole story.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.972
I'm only sorry you had to listen
to such horrors.

19:09.492 --> 19:14.931
Why? Do you think Thomas
is the first man of... that sort
that I've ever come across?

19:14.932 --> 19:17.771
Well, I would hope so.
Well, he isn't.

19:17.772 --> 19:21.691
And I'll tell you something else.
I think James may have led him on.

19:21.692 --> 19:23.051
What?!

19:23.052 --> 19:26.531
I cannot listen to such allegations.
Calm down.

19:26.532 --> 19:31.411
I don't mean deliberately,
but he's a vain and silly flirt.

19:31.412 --> 19:34.651
He may have given Thomas the wrong
impression without meaning to.

19:34.652 --> 19:37.811
I can hardly believe
we're having this conversation.

19:37.812 --> 19:41.771
Maybe not, but I won't sit by
and let that young whippersnapper

19:41.772 --> 19:44.371
ruin a man for the rest of his life.

19:44.372 --> 19:47.691
Not a man who was wounded
in the service of king and country.

19:47.692 --> 19:49.851
We may have no choice.

19:49.852 --> 19:53.371
These practices, with which
you're apparently so familiar,

19:53.372 --> 19:55.211
are against the law.

19:55.212 --> 19:57.731
I know that.
Very well, then.

19:57.732 --> 20:00.611
If we stand up to James
and he goes to the police,

20:00.612 --> 20:04.732
it will only put Thomas in prison,
which he will not thank you for.

20:27.172 --> 20:28.891
Inspecting the love nest?

20:28.892 --> 20:30.892
Just fetching some coal.

20:41.052 --> 20:42.651
I envy you.

20:42.652 --> 20:44.571
Whatever you say.

20:44.572 --> 20:46.572
No, I mean it.

20:48.292 --> 20:51.532
The happy couple,
and everyone's so pleased for you.

20:52.812 --> 20:54.971
Can't imagine what that's like.

20:54.972 --> 20:57.212
Perhaps you should try being nicer.

20:59.172 --> 21:01.531
It's being nice
that got me into trouble.

21:01.532 --> 21:04.012
What do you mean?

21:05.252 --> 21:07.252
Never mind.

21:08.252 --> 21:10.491
I'll be gone soon.

21:10.492 --> 21:12.292
And now you're here...

21:13.532 --> 21:15.171
you'll be glad of that.

21:15.172 --> 21:17.252
Yes, I will be.

21:28.998 --> 21:32.117
I assume I can count on you,
Mr Molesley.

21:32.118 --> 21:35.358
Oh, I'll say. There's not much
I don't know about cricket.

21:36.158 --> 21:37.878
You make me quite nervous.

21:38.656 --> 21:42.695
So with you, me, James, Alfred,
both you hall boys,

21:42.696 --> 21:44.895
that makes six from down here.

21:44.896 --> 21:47.415
I can't play, Mr Carson,
but I can keep score.

21:47.416 --> 21:49.055
Good. Very good.

21:49.056 --> 21:54.695
So, with his lordship, Mr Crawley
and MR Branson, we're already ten.

21:54.696 --> 21:57.055
What about you, Mr Barrow?

21:57.056 --> 21:58.815
I think I'll be gone by then.

21:58.816 --> 22:01.136
Yes, you will.

22:05.696 --> 22:09.375
Where's Mary? I was looking for her
but Anna said she'd gone out.

22:09.376 --> 22:12.736
She's away for the night.
She'll be back tomorrow. Oh?

22:14.456 --> 22:17.295
Cora, is everything
as it should be between them?

22:17.296 --> 22:19.535
Between Mary and Matthew?

22:19.536 --> 22:20.975
Oh.

22:20.976 --> 22:22.695
Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?

22:22.696 --> 22:27.575
Well, I find I'm rather impatient
to get the succession settled.

22:27.576 --> 22:30.415
Robert, it's still early days.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.455
Luncheon is served, my lady.

22:32.456 --> 22:34.215
Is it just us? Yes.

22:34.216 --> 22:39.455
Tom's on the far side of the estate,
so he said he'd eat in the pub.
He's hiding from me.

22:39.456 --> 22:43.135
Until Matthew's told me the worst.
Probably.

22:43.136 --> 22:48.615
May I take the opportunity
to bring your lordship up to date
with the team? Are we in good shape?

22:48.616 --> 22:53.295
I reckon that with three family
players and seven from downstairs,
we're only one short.

22:53.296 --> 22:55.935
Two short. Branson won't play.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.775
Mr Branson is busy at the moment.

22:58.776 --> 23:00.295
Is he, my lady?

23:00.296 --> 23:02.375
Might I point out
that we're all busy,

23:02.376 --> 23:05.495
but we still find time
to support the honour of the house.

23:05.496 --> 23:09.175
Yes. But that is not
the right road to travel, Carson,

23:09.176 --> 23:12.296
if we want to remain
in her ladyship's good graces.

23:19.016 --> 23:22.975
I know you all have
lots of things to do,
so just run about and do them.

23:22.976 --> 23:27.935
I'll go and change.
But I thought we'd all have dinner
together and have a proper catch-up.

23:27.936 --> 23:31.095
If you'd like, but please don't
let me be a nuisance. We could...

23:31.096 --> 23:35.535
I insist. A good family gossip
will be my payment in kind.

23:35.536 --> 23:39.696
Then of course we'd be delighted.
Good. We dine at half past eight.

23:55.656 --> 23:57.456
Hello, operator?

23:59.296 --> 24:01.096
Knightsbridge 4056.

24:06.056 --> 24:09.655
I've been through those replies
to her ladyship's advertisement.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.895
I don't think there's one
where I should be happier than here.

24:12.896 --> 24:15.055
That's very flattering.

24:15.056 --> 24:17.616
There was a nice letter
from a Mrs Watson...

24:18.616 --> 24:20.655
but it was near Cheadle.

24:20.656 --> 24:24.735
Cheadle's very close to where
Mr and Mrs Bryant live. Oh, I see.

24:24.736 --> 24:28.215
And you feel that would
defeat the purpose

24:28.216 --> 24:30.735
if the goal is
to leave your past behind you.

24:30.736 --> 24:34.176
Don't you, ma'am?
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

24:35.176 --> 24:38.336
It's a pity if it was the only one
that was appealing.

24:41.416 --> 24:43.936
So it looks as if
I'll be staying on.

24:45.176 --> 24:49.975
I'm sorry if it makes trouble
between you and the dowager.
Oh, don't worry about that.

24:49.976 --> 24:54.496
If you'd gone, she'd have found some
other bone for us to fight over.

25:09.336 --> 25:11.136
You look very pretty today.

25:12.256 --> 25:16.455
I'm not sure how professional it is
of me to point that out.

25:16.456 --> 25:18.656
Well, it's jolly nice of you.

25:20.656 --> 25:22.976
So, er... business!

25:24.296 --> 25:26.896
Now, I've read your piece.

25:28.616 --> 25:32.575
The plight of ex-soldiers is not an
obvious topic for a woman's column.

25:32.576 --> 25:34.295
I know it isn't very feminine,

25:34.296 --> 25:37.935
but I felt so strongly about it,
I thought it was worth a try.

25:37.936 --> 25:39.975
No, no, you misunderstand me.

25:39.976 --> 25:43.215
I like the idea of a woman taking
a position on a man's subject.

25:43.216 --> 25:46.415
Don't be afraid of being serious
when it feels right.

25:46.416 --> 25:48.655
Really? Really.

25:48.656 --> 25:51.575
No, I think
we're on to something new here.

25:51.576 --> 25:53.975
The mature female voice in debate.

25:53.976 --> 25:58.375
I don't like the sound of "mature".
No. Erm...

25:58.376 --> 26:02.256
Balanced?
Yes. Let's go with "balanced".

26:03.536 --> 26:07.415
Are you in town tonight and by any
chance looking for something to do?

26:07.416 --> 26:10.575
I am, but sadly I'm spoken for.

26:10.576 --> 26:12.416
That's a pity.

26:13.416 --> 26:16.376
But you will let me know
when you're up in London again?

26:20.176 --> 26:22.655
Why are you bothering with Thomas?

26:22.656 --> 26:25.455
He's going. Good riddance.

26:25.456 --> 26:29.096
I don't know.
Something he said.

26:30.096 --> 26:31.975
I feel funny taking his job.

26:31.976 --> 26:34.015
You haven't taken his job.

26:34.016 --> 26:36.935
He filled in for you
while you were away, that's all.

26:36.936 --> 26:38.336
Mm.

26:39.176 --> 26:42.735
I might ask Mrs Hughes.
She usually knows what's going on.

26:42.736 --> 26:44.095
Oh!

26:44.096 --> 26:48.536
Which is more than YOU do.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.656
Taxi!

27:01.936 --> 27:03.576
Warwick Square, please.

27:19.256 --> 27:21.056
Now I understand.

27:22.696 --> 27:25.576
You're not too shocked, then?
No.

27:26.616 --> 27:30.135
But why is Mr Carson?
It's not as if none of us knew.

27:30.136 --> 27:33.895
I think the point is
we didn't know officially.

27:33.896 --> 27:36.615
That's what Mr Carson finds hard.

27:36.616 --> 27:38.655
He can't avoid the subject
any longer

27:38.656 --> 27:40.695
because it's lying there on the mat.

27:40.696 --> 27:45.015
And he can't stand up to Jimmy?
He says he's powerless.

27:45.016 --> 27:48.135
And it's true we won't help Thomas
by putting him in prison.

27:48.136 --> 27:50.375
I wouldn't wish that on any man.

27:50.376 --> 27:54.216
Imagine me
feeling sorry for Thomas.

27:55.536 --> 27:57.616
Life is full of surprises.

28:00.056 --> 28:02.375
You don't think
we should have waited?

28:02.376 --> 28:07.015
No! Why should your delicious dinner
be spoiled just because Rose
forgot the time?

28:07.016 --> 28:10.015
It's my fault. I shouldn't have
let her out of my sight.

28:10.016 --> 28:12.855
Nonsense. You had stuff to see to.

28:12.856 --> 28:15.735
Talking of which,
how did you get on with your editor?

28:15.736 --> 28:18.975
Oh. Quite well, I think.

28:18.976 --> 28:21.855
How about you, Matthew?
I was only running errands.

28:21.856 --> 28:24.215
My main thing is tomorrow.

28:24.216 --> 28:27.296
Mead, what is it?

28:27.976 --> 28:29.335
Come on.

28:29.336 --> 28:34.095
This is the driver who took up Lady
Rose from outside the house, milady.

28:34.096 --> 28:38.935
I came back because... she left
her scarf in the back of my cab.

28:38.936 --> 28:40.735
How very good of you.

28:40.736 --> 28:45.016
Go on. Tell them why they sent you
up to the dining room.

28:47.176 --> 28:51.495
I know where she is, ma'am.
Your maid downstairs said
you might like to hear.

28:51.496 --> 28:54.055
And she was right.
Where did she go?

28:54.056 --> 28:57.055
First to Warwick Square,

28:57.056 --> 28:59.455
to pick up her... friend.

28:59.456 --> 29:01.895
And then you took her on somewhere?

29:01.896 --> 29:06.696
Eventually. I was sat outside
for the best part of two hours.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.615
How very expensive.

29:11.616 --> 29:15.695
When they came out, they said
they wanted to go to a club.

29:15.696 --> 29:18.456
The Blue Dragon, on Greek Street.

29:19.096 --> 29:20.856
And what sort of club is that?

29:21.616 --> 29:25.015
Well... You know.

29:25.016 --> 29:28.136
That's the point. I don't.

30:17.376 --> 30:20.736
This is like the outer circle from
Dante's Inferno. The OUTER circle?

30:23.456 --> 30:26.776
There she is.
Heavens, what a transformation!

30:30.576 --> 30:35.135
And that, presumably,
is the friend she spent
two hours with in Warwick Square.

30:35.136 --> 30:37.536
Let's not start down that track.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.656
Oh, my...!

30:59.936 --> 31:01.935
How on earth did you find me?

31:01.936 --> 31:04.535
How do you do?
I'm a cousin of Rose's mother.

31:04.536 --> 31:06.095
Lady Rosamund Painswick.

31:06.096 --> 31:08.335
And this is Terence Margadale.

31:08.336 --> 31:10.535
How do you do? Please, sit down.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.856
Can you bring some more glasses?

31:13.456 --> 31:19.135
Tell me, where is MRS Margadale?
She's in the country, at the...

31:19.136 --> 31:21.575
Erm...

31:21.576 --> 31:23.935
Er, Terence used to work for Daddy,

31:23.936 --> 31:26.335
so he's more of
a family friend, really.

31:26.336 --> 31:29.255
Oh! So Cousin Shrimpie
will be pleased to hear about him?

31:29.256 --> 31:31.176
No, please...
Why don't we dance?

31:43.736 --> 31:47.455
Now look, I think I can get Rosamund
and Edith to keep their mouths shut

31:47.456 --> 31:50.695
if you come with us now and have
nothing more to do with this man,

31:50.696 --> 31:52.935
at least not until
you're out of our charge.

31:52.936 --> 31:56.175
But he's... he's terribly unhappy,
and it's not his fault.

31:56.176 --> 32:01.375
His wife is absolutely horrid.
Married men who wish to seduce young
women always have horrid wives.

32:01.376 --> 32:05.215
I suggest you meet Mrs Margadale
before you come to any
final conclusions.

32:05.216 --> 32:09.615
You're wrong. He's in love with me.
He wants to marry me as soon as
he can get a divorce.

32:09.616 --> 32:11.575
And when will that be?

32:11.576 --> 32:14.815
Well... it's terribly difficult.
Yes, I thought it might be.

32:14.816 --> 32:20.255
Now, will you accept my conditions
or do I throw you to Lady Rosamund?

32:20.256 --> 32:22.895
Why are you helping me?

32:22.896 --> 32:25.856
I'm on the side of the downtrodden.

32:28.736 --> 32:30.536
Excuse me.

32:33.376 --> 32:35.415
I rather like Warwick Square.

32:35.416 --> 32:37.855
A sort of Belgravia
without the bustle.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.695
We haven't been there very long.

32:39.696 --> 32:42.735
Rose is feeling rather tired
so we're leaving.

32:42.736 --> 32:44.416
Won't you at least stay for a...?

32:48.976 --> 32:52.815
Well, no.
No, I'm glad she's staying.

32:52.816 --> 32:55.255
But one forgets about parenthood.

32:55.256 --> 32:57.215
The on-and-on-ness of it.

32:57.216 --> 33:00.775
Were you a very involved mother
with Robert and Rosamund?

33:00.776 --> 33:03.415
Does it surprise you? A bit.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.735
I'd imagined them surrounded
by nannies and governesses,

33:06.736 --> 33:10.736
being starched and ironed
to spend an hour with you after tea.

33:11.416 --> 33:15.656
Yes, but it was an hour every day.

33:16.656 --> 33:18.895
I see, yes.

33:18.896 --> 33:20.975
How tiring.

33:20.976 --> 33:24.495
After the money turned up
from Mr Swire,

33:24.496 --> 33:26.616
things went back to normal.

33:30.456 --> 33:32.615
Mr Carson, may I have a word?

33:32.616 --> 33:34.616
I'll leave you. Just...

33:37.216 --> 33:39.016
Well?

33:40.376 --> 33:43.055
When's Mr Barrow leaving?

33:43.056 --> 33:44.456
I'm not sure.

33:45.096 --> 33:48.975
He's lost his job. Why can't he
just go? I find it very awkward.

33:48.976 --> 33:52.415
He made a mistake.
You're still in one piece.

33:52.416 --> 33:55.736
Why do you have to be
such a big girl's blouse about it?

33:56.496 --> 33:59.736
I'm sorry, Mr Carson,
but I won't change my mind.

34:02.456 --> 34:05.976
I suppose you know
who's put him up to this, Mr Carson.

34:06.976 --> 34:09.054
That Mr Bates is gobby, isn't he?

34:09.056 --> 34:10.695
Why do you say that?

34:10.696 --> 34:13.735
Everyone talked about him
as if he could walk on water,

34:13.735 --> 34:15.255
but he's got a mouth on him.

34:15.255 --> 34:16.614
What did he say?

34:16.616 --> 34:18.975
He was sticking up for Mr Barrow.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.094
Is this because of Mr Carson
not giving him a reference?

34:22.096 --> 34:26.295
I don't think it's right. Do you?
Yes, I bloody well do
think it's right!

34:29.775 --> 34:31.576
You know nothing about it.

34:34.735 --> 34:36.576
What's happened?

34:37.456 --> 34:39.255
What did I say?

34:39.255 --> 34:41.295
I shouldn't get involved, dear.

34:41.295 --> 34:44.176
If you'll take my advice,
I should stay out of it.

34:50.536 --> 34:53.375
Has there been
any progress with Ethel?

34:53.376 --> 34:57.415
No. I'm sorry to disappoint you
but she doesn't want to go.

34:57.416 --> 35:01.695
Not one of them was right?
One. A Mrs Watson.

35:01.696 --> 35:04.815
But the house was near
where the Bryants live.

35:04.816 --> 35:07.615
And to be honest,
I suspect that was the reason.

35:07.616 --> 35:10.575
A chance to see little Charlie
from time to time.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.215
Well, I can't blame her for that.
Of course not.

35:13.216 --> 35:15.655
But the Bryants
would be bound to find out,

35:15.656 --> 35:17.896
which would only lead
to more heartbreak.

35:23.216 --> 35:25.735
I'll write to you as soon as I hear,

35:25.736 --> 35:29.495
but it's extremely unlikely
there is anything wrong at all.

35:29.496 --> 35:33.295
This may prove
an expensive journey for you.

35:33.296 --> 35:36.656
May I ask you a question, Dr Ryder?

35:37.536 --> 35:39.455
Has my wife been to see you?

35:39.456 --> 35:41.735
I'm not aware of treating
a Mrs Crawley.

35:41.736 --> 35:45.376
But even if I had, I could not
possibly comment on it. Of course.

35:46.536 --> 35:50.175
It's only... I can't bear
to think of her being worried

35:50.176 --> 35:53.296
when I know very well that
if anyone's to blame, it's me.

35:53.976 --> 35:57.256
I'm not sure blame is
a very useful concept in this area.

35:58.856 --> 36:01.695
Please believe me
that probability and logic

36:01.696 --> 36:06.096
indicate a Crawley baby
yowling in its crib before too long.

36:07.816 --> 36:09.416
Thank you.

36:10.256 --> 36:12.056
Goodbye. Goodbye.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.976
Mrs Levenson for Dr Ryder.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.440
This should buck you up.

36:42.520 --> 36:46.599
Why did you go without saying,
when I knew all along it was me?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.320
You know nothing of the sort.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.840
In fact, it was me.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.560
What do you mean?

36:56.720 --> 37:00.040
There WAS something wrong,
with...

37:01.600 --> 37:05.279
Actually, I can't talk about
this sort of thing, even to you.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.240
You sound like Robert.
Well, I am his daughter.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.999
The fact is...

37:12.000 --> 37:13.760
it meant a small operation.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.279
What?

37:16.280 --> 37:18.199
It's all right. It was weeks ago.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.760
That's why I've been keeping you
at arm's length.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.840
I thought you'd gone off me.

37:26.920 --> 37:32.679
Anyway, today was just to see
if all is well, and he says it is.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.959
He says I'm to get in touch with him
in six months' time

37:35.960 --> 37:38.280
but that I'll be pregnant
before then.

37:42.120 --> 37:46.480
So... now we can start making babies.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.960
I feel very guilty
not telling Susan about last night.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.839
Mummy wouldn't understand.
Nor do I.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.439
What were you thinking,

37:58.440 --> 38:02.359
a respectable, well-born young woman
going out with a married man?

38:02.360 --> 38:06.279
Rose knows it all depends on her
behaviour for the rest of her stay.

38:06.280 --> 38:10.679
One false step
and I shall personally
telephone Lady Flintshire.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.519
Very well.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.000
But I don't approve.

38:37.760 --> 38:43.560
Rose, you've obviously
read too many novels about young
women admired for their feistiness.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.839
Do you think they will keep quiet?

38:47.840 --> 38:51.679
I expect so, as long as you
stick to your side of the bargain.

38:51.680 --> 38:55.199
Even Cousin Rosamund? She didn't like
being made to keep the secret.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.440
Probably because she knows
that Granny will be furious.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.679
You see? How I turn it,

39:10.680 --> 39:12.399
first this way,

39:12.400 --> 39:13.800
and now that.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.919
Alfred, what's the matter?

39:19.920 --> 39:22.519
I'm not easy
about this business with Mr Barrow.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.359
Well, why not take a turn
with Mr Moseley's bat?

39:25.360 --> 39:27.280
That'll put a smile on your face.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.959
Is Mr Carson really
not giving Mr Barrow a reference?

39:32.960 --> 39:35.319
What will he do
if he hasn't got a reference?

39:35.320 --> 39:39.679
He could always go abroad. He might
do well in America, Mr Barrow.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.720
Seems a bit drastic. Why should he
go abroad? Keep your nose out of it.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.920
Why won't someone
tell us what's going on?
Because you wouldn't understand it.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.240
I very much hope.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.799
Why didn't Carson tell me?
He's the one who's being undermined.

39:58.800 --> 40:03.039
It's a very difficult subject
for him to discuss. I can imagine.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.959
But it's not as if
we didn't all know about Barrow.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.239
That's what I said to Mrs Hughes.

40:08.240 --> 40:14.279
If I shouted blue murder every time
someone tried to kiss me at Eton,
I'd have gone hoarse in a month.

40:14.280 --> 40:18.119
What a tiresome fellow.
It's not the boy's fault, my lord.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.959
He's been whipped up,
told if he doesn't see it through,

40:21.960 --> 40:24.599
we'd all suspect him
of batting for the same team.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.559
Crikey! But who'd do that?

40:26.560 --> 40:28.479
Who's got it in for Barrow?

40:28.480 --> 40:29.999
Miss O'Brien.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.279
O'Brien? I thought
they were as thick as thieves.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.240
Not now, my lord.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.439
Now, I've spoken to your mother.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.919
She has a new plan
for when you leave here.

40:43.920 --> 40:48.880
But aren't I going back to London?
Oh, no. It's so horrid and dusty.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.639
What is Mummy's plan?

40:51.640 --> 40:55.679
They're opening Duneagle early.
You're to go there.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.680
On my own? No. Your Aunt Agatha
will keep you company.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.759
Alone in Scotland with Aunt Agatha?

41:03.760 --> 41:05.359
She can't be serious.

41:05.360 --> 41:09.559
I know. Lady Agatha isn't
much of a party person, I admit.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.239
This is all because I went up
to London to see Terence, isn't it?

41:13.240 --> 41:15.880
How did she find out?
Who gave me away?

41:17.200 --> 41:19.199
I don't know who Terence is.

41:19.200 --> 41:23.079
Of course. It's not your fault,
Aunt Violet. But they promised...

41:23.080 --> 41:26.599
Don't shoot the messenger. I'm only
relaying your mother's orders.

41:26.600 --> 41:30.640
You're to stay for the cricket match
and head north the next day.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.319
Perhaps I'll run away.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.239
Not this time.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.959
My maid will travel with you

41:36.960 --> 41:39.359
so you have someone to talk to
on the journey.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.759
I won't be held a prisoner forever.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.520
No. One day you'll be older
and out of our power.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.080
But not yet.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.000
Prison's changed you.

41:56.920 --> 42:01.319
There was a time when
nothing was too bad for me
as far as you were concerned.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.359
Prison HAS changed me.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.559
You do know Miss O'Brien
is behind it?

42:05.560 --> 42:07.560
I knew someone was.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.079
Jimmy'd never think of it
for himself.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.119
Doesn't it bother you
that she'll get away with it?

42:14.120 --> 42:15.639
Not really.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.679
Without a reference,

42:17.680 --> 42:20.559
after ten years here,

42:20.560 --> 42:22.319
you'll never work again.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.120
Not in England.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.359
But elsewhere maybe.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.200
A cousin in Bombay. I might go there.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.079
I like the sun.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.599
You must know something about Miss
O'Brien you can use against her.

42:36.600 --> 42:40.840
You've heard of the phrase
"to know when you're beaten"?

42:41.360 --> 42:44.279
Well, I'm beaten, Mr Bates.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.480
I'm well and truly beaten.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.239
Then give me the weapon
and I'll do the work.

42:50.240 --> 42:53.280
What can I say
that will make her change her mind?

42:59.400 --> 43:01.439
It is not how we do things!

43:01.440 --> 43:04.799
Many of the farmers' families have
been at Downton as long as we have.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.519
We need to see
more profits from the farm!
Here we go. Profit, profit, profit!

43:08.520 --> 43:10.719
We cannot go forward with no income.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.959
But why not tackle it gradually?

43:12.960 --> 43:16.239
Perhaps buy some time
by investing your capital.

43:16.240 --> 43:20.599
I hear of schemes daily that'll
double whatever's put into them,
or treble it, or more.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.199
Many offer high rewards.
Very few deliver them.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.799
There's a chap in America, er...
Charles Ponzi,

43:25.800 --> 43:28.319
who offers a huge return
after 90 days.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.519
Harry Stoke has gone in
with a bundle...

43:30.520 --> 43:33.959
Then Harry Stoke, whoever he is,
is a fool. But if I could find out...

43:33.960 --> 43:38.159
Last time you took an interest in
investment, you ruined the family!
Now look here!

43:38.160 --> 43:41.639
As captain of this ship,
Robert's entitled to some respect.

43:41.640 --> 43:45.359
He didn't mean any disrespect. He
does a marvellous impression of it.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.799
We're giving the farmers a choice,
that's all.

43:47.800 --> 43:51.719
If they sell,
the larger units will let us meet
the challenges of the modern world.

43:51.720 --> 43:56.439
We need to build something
that will last, not stand by
and watch it crumble into dust.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.279
What about the tenants?!

43:58.280 --> 44:01.679
What about the men and women
who put their trust in us?

44:01.680 --> 44:04.279
Is this fair to them?
I don't believe so.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.319
But isn't the most important thing
for them, or us,

44:07.320 --> 44:10.920
to maintain Downton
as a source of employment?

44:12.160 --> 44:14.080
So you're against me too?

44:15.640 --> 44:20.639
It seems to me your plan adds up to
carrying on as if nothing's changed,

44:20.640 --> 44:23.559
to spend Matthew's money
keeping up the illusion,

44:23.560 --> 44:27.639
then, when we've fallen into
a bottomless pit of debt,
we'll sell up and go.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.040
So yes, I believe Matthew is right.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.440
I see.

44:33.760 --> 44:37.080
You seem to be agreed that
there's no place for me in all this.

44:38.320 --> 44:41.280
So obviously it's time for me
to take a back seat.

44:51.720 --> 44:54.880
Hello. Is that the Daily Telegraph
information desk?

44:55.960 --> 44:59.559
I want to find out
about a London editor.

44:59.560 --> 45:02.080
Michael Gregson, of the Sketch.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.679
Just some general stuff.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.719
His education,
what he's done since then.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.240
And... a little
about his private life.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.719
But why here?

45:25.720 --> 45:28.759
I don't like the idea
of her being our first visitor.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.079
I want to be away from the others.

45:31.080 --> 45:36.039
I don't know why you're doing this.
You don't even like Thomas.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.800
Because I know what it is
to feel powerless.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.120
To see a life slide away and there's
nothing you can do to stop it.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.919
Quite the orator.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.960
Have you thought about
standing for Parliament?

46:04.840 --> 46:07.879
Oh, yes. Very nice.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.680
It'll be even better
with a bit of money spent on it.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.839
Can I get you some tea?

46:13.840 --> 46:15.679
If I'm staying long enough.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.639
I don't know what it is
Mr Bates wants to see me about.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.400
You'll have time for tea.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.239
Will that be all, ma'am?
There is one thing.

46:33.240 --> 46:36.679
There was a letter delivered by hand
this afternoon.

46:36.680 --> 46:40.519
It's from the dowager. She wants us
to call on her in the morning.

46:40.520 --> 46:44.320
But why would she want ME? No doubt
we'll find out in the morning.

46:46.880 --> 46:50.920
Well, I am surprised to find
that you're a fan Mr Oscar Wilde.

46:51.760 --> 46:55.279
You've known about Mr Barrow
all along, so what's changed now?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.559
Perhaps I've come to my senses.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.519
You mean you've found a way
to be even nastier than usual.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.799
Get back in the knife box,
Miss Sharp.

47:02.800 --> 47:06.559
I want you to persuade Jimmy
to let Mr Barrow have a reference

47:06.560 --> 47:09.000
so when he leaves here
he can start again.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.040
Why would Jimmy listen to me?

47:13.400 --> 47:16.560
I won't do it.
I think you will.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.599
I'm going.
Sort it out by this evening.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.360
Or? Or you'll find your secret
is no longer safe with me.

47:41.860 --> 47:45.179
I'm just saying
I think you've made your point.

47:45.180 --> 47:48.259
To let it go now would be
the gentlemanly thing to do.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.459
You said that if I let it go

47:50.460 --> 47:52.779
they'd think I was
up to the same thing,

47:52.780 --> 47:54.740
that I wasn't a proper man.

47:55.820 --> 47:57.820
If you'd done nothing, yes.

47:58.780 --> 48:04.980
But this way you'll come across as
merciful and not vindictive.
Do you see?

48:06.660 --> 48:08.779
I never wanted to push it this far.

48:08.780 --> 48:11.380
Then you'll be glad to stop it.

48:12.340 --> 48:14.579
You're sure I won't
be made to look a fool?

48:14.580 --> 48:16.819
Far from it.

48:16.820 --> 48:20.379
I think they'll hold you higher
in their estimation.

48:20.380 --> 48:22.779
Ah, James. Upstairs, please.

48:22.780 --> 48:26.500
May I have a word with you, please,
Mr Carson, before we go up?

48:37.180 --> 48:39.539
But why London?
You've only just got back.

48:39.540 --> 48:42.819
I've had some bad news, that's all.
What sort of bad news?

48:42.820 --> 48:45.179
Never mind. It's not our business.

48:45.180 --> 48:48.540
How's the cricket team coming along?
We're still two short.

48:49.220 --> 48:51.579
And you're still determined
not to play?

48:51.580 --> 48:54.939
It's not that I WON'T play.
I CAN'T play. I don't know how.

48:54.940 --> 48:56.579
Stop twisting his arm.

48:56.580 --> 49:00.059
Any news on the move, Tom? We're
going to miss you both so much.

49:00.060 --> 49:04.259
You told Matthew
not to twist his arm.
Now you're doing exactly the same.

49:04.260 --> 49:08.300
I just think children are happier
in families. I'm sorry but I do.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.660
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

49:12.860 --> 49:16.699
But I suppose Barrow
will have to go.

49:16.700 --> 49:18.539
My lord?

49:18.572 --> 49:20.491
He's so good at cricket.

49:20.492 --> 49:24.292
I know we were soundly beaten last
year, but he got most of our runs.

49:24.972 --> 49:29.571
I thought we just wanted him to have
a reference so he could find work
when he leaves.

49:29.572 --> 49:33.571
I know, but now that I think
about it, Carson ought to
insist that he stays on.

49:33.572 --> 49:37.091
He needs to re-establish
his authority over James.

49:37.092 --> 49:40.571
Couldn't Mr Barrow just stay
till after the match and then go?

49:40.572 --> 49:44.412
That seems rather unkind.
Wouldn't we be using him?

49:46.212 --> 49:49.851
He might not want to stay, my lord,
after the unpleasantness.

49:49.852 --> 49:51.651
I think he will.

49:51.652 --> 49:53.412
But don't forget the cricket.

49:54.132 --> 49:55.852
I won't, my lord.

49:59.452 --> 50:02.691
See how my grip is firm,

50:02.692 --> 50:04.331
but tender.

50:04.332 --> 50:06.532
Cherish the ball. Don't crush it.

50:07.492 --> 50:10.491
Right. Gabriel, have a try.

50:10.492 --> 50:13.931
Is it true you've given in
and let Mr Barrow get away with it?

50:13.932 --> 50:17.371
It was dragging on and on. At least
this way we'll be rid of him.

50:17.372 --> 50:22.291
I heard his lordship wants him
to stay for the cricket match.
It won't be for much longer.

50:22.292 --> 50:24.331
Then he'll get his reference and go.

50:24.332 --> 50:26.132
And good riddance.

50:34.732 --> 50:37.171
I'm... going over to Windmill Farm,

50:37.172 --> 50:39.971
to see what we can do
with the outbuildings.

50:39.972 --> 50:43.812
Would you like to come with me?
I'm sure you can manage on your own.

50:50.652 --> 50:53.532
Aren't you going?
I'll meet him there later.

50:55.372 --> 50:57.491
He's putting a good face on it,

50:57.492 --> 51:01.611
but you know he wants you with him
on this, more than anything.

51:01.612 --> 51:03.211
I should not serve him well.

51:03.212 --> 51:06.131
I don't have the instincts
for what he wants to do.

51:06.132 --> 51:10.012
You mean you're not a tradesman?
Your word, not mine.

51:10.732 --> 51:13.332
Shall I tell you how I look at it?

51:13.852 --> 51:17.891
Every man or woman
who marries into this house,
every child born into it,

51:17.892 --> 51:21.331
has to put their gifts
at the family's disposal.

51:21.332 --> 51:24.411
I'm a hard worker,
and I've some knowledge of the land.

51:24.412 --> 51:28.291
Matthew knows the law and the nature
of business. Which I do not.

51:28.292 --> 51:31.931
You understand the responsibilities
we owe to the people round here,

51:31.932 --> 51:34.571
those who work for the estate
and those that don't.

51:34.572 --> 51:38.411
It seems to me if we could manage
to pool all of that,

51:38.412 --> 51:40.971
if we each do what we can do,

51:40.972 --> 51:42.812
then Downton has a real chance.

51:43.932 --> 51:46.691
You're very eloquent.

51:46.692 --> 51:50.131
You're a good spokesman
for Matthew's vision.

51:50.132 --> 51:52.691
Better than he has been recently.

51:52.692 --> 51:55.172
So you'll give us your backing?

51:57.812 --> 52:00.212
I'll think about it.

52:01.772 --> 52:03.452
On one condition.

52:04.772 --> 52:06.572
You play cricket for the house.

52:09.532 --> 52:13.252
We all have to do what we can do.

52:16.692 --> 52:19.892
For God's sake,
if it means that much to you.

52:29.612 --> 52:31.131
Oh!

52:31.132 --> 52:35.131
You didn't expect to find ME here.
No.

52:35.132 --> 52:38.371
I thought the only person
who could tell us with any accuracy

52:38.372 --> 52:41.491
the Bryants' response
to Ethel's working nearby

52:41.492 --> 52:43.291
were the Bryants themselves.

52:43.292 --> 52:46.411
Lady Grantham wrote to me
explaining your wish.

52:46.412 --> 52:50.211
Well... it was only that Mrs Watson
had answered the advertisement...

52:50.212 --> 52:52.531
I know the circumstances.

52:52.532 --> 52:56.371
Just as I know that you would like
to see how Charlie's getting on.

52:56.372 --> 52:59.211
As it happens,
I've been uncomfortable

52:59.212 --> 53:01.411
about keeping a mother from her son.

53:01.412 --> 53:05.251
Although I would not want to confuse
him until he's much older, if then...

53:05.252 --> 53:08.611
You wouldn't have to confuse him.
I've already worked it out.

53:08.612 --> 53:11.571
I'm his old nanny, employed by you
when he was first born.

53:11.572 --> 53:16.492
But what about when he talks about
you to Mr Bryant? You will please
leave Mr Bryant to me.

53:17.172 --> 53:22.451
Now, Ethel, you must write to
Mrs Watson today and get it settled.

53:22.452 --> 53:24.892
And I'll be able to see Charlie!

53:26.212 --> 53:27.971
It won't be easy.

53:27.972 --> 53:30.412
It'll be easier than not seeing him.

53:33.212 --> 53:35.212
Very much easier.

53:37.732 --> 53:42.932
And if Mr Barrow is to stay on,
what would he be? My valet?

53:43.532 --> 53:48.691
You can make him under-butler. Then
your dinners will be grand enough
for Chu Chin Chow.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.331
And he can apply to be a butler
when he does leave.

53:51.332 --> 53:53.731
But that would make him my superior.

53:53.732 --> 53:57.451
Oh, I don't know. Under-butler,
head valet. There's not much in it.

53:57.452 --> 53:59.331
The question remains,

53:59.332 --> 54:02.051
how do we convince James?

54:02.052 --> 54:03.891
Well...

54:03.892 --> 54:08.131
It's his lordship
who wants Mr Barrow to stay on,

54:08.132 --> 54:11.092
so I think his lordship
can bring it about.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.212
Is this worth it?

54:19.732 --> 54:21.532
I've no time to learn anything.

54:22.372 --> 54:25.931
Couldn't I just trust
to beginner's luck? Certainly not.

54:25.932 --> 54:29.931
I want you to profit
from my skills in gratitude
for bringing Robert round.

54:29.932 --> 54:31.852
Not completely. Not yet.

54:34.132 --> 54:36.132
Elbow up.

54:36.772 --> 54:39.291
You won't make a gentleman of me,
you know.

54:39.292 --> 54:43.651
You can teach me to fish, ride
and shoot, but I'd still be
an Irish Mick in my heart.

54:43.652 --> 54:45.492
So I should hope.

54:48.972 --> 54:52.332
There! See?
You're getting the hang of it.

54:55.492 --> 54:57.691
I'm sorry if this is inconvenient.

54:57.692 --> 55:00.571
It's unexpected, not inconvenient.

55:00.572 --> 55:02.892
I suppose I'd better just say it.

55:04.292 --> 55:06.092
Please do.

55:08.612 --> 55:12.732
I had the impression on my last visit
that you were flirting.

55:13.812 --> 55:16.532
Giving signs
that you found me attractive.

55:17.572 --> 55:19.571
If I'm wrong, then I apologise.

55:19.572 --> 55:21.812
You're not wrong.

55:23.772 --> 55:27.612
But since then I have discovered
that you are, in fact, married.

55:29.452 --> 55:30.932
Yes.

55:31.612 --> 55:36.931
I'm afraid I find the idea
of a married man flirting
with me wholly repugnant.

55:36.932 --> 55:39.411
So I must hand in
my resignation at once.

55:39.412 --> 55:43.091
No. It's true, I am married, but
I hope you'll allow me to explain.

55:43.092 --> 55:47.731
Explain what? I am familiar
with the institution of marriage.

55:47.732 --> 55:50.292
Yes, but not with this one.

55:51.492 --> 55:54.891
My wife is in an asylum,
and she has been for some years.

55:54.892 --> 55:57.332
Lizzie was a wonderful person.
I loved her very much.

55:57.333 --> 56:01.132
It took me a long time to accept
that the woman I knew was gone...

56:02.652 --> 56:04.611
and wouldn't be coming back.

56:04.612 --> 56:07.411
Then why haven't you got a divorce?

56:07.412 --> 56:11.051
I can't. A... lunatic
is not deemed responsible.

56:11.052 --> 56:14.372
She's neither the guilty
nor the innocent party.

56:17.212 --> 56:22.292
It means that I'm... tied
for the rest of my life to a...

56:24.332 --> 56:26.811
a madwoman,

56:26.812 --> 56:28.612
who doesn't even know me.

56:29.212 --> 56:33.291
I can't begin to tell you how much
it cheers me to read your column

56:33.292 --> 56:36.252
and to meet when we do.

56:36.812 --> 56:40.892
I hope very much
you'll consider staying on.

56:52.941 --> 56:55.461
Heads.
Ah. Well, there we are.

57:02.565 --> 57:04.085
Yes!

57:09.845 --> 57:12.284
I'm glad everything's settled
with Ethel,

57:12.285 --> 57:15.804
but I trust you can find another
cook without too much difficulty.

57:15.805 --> 57:18.204
Preferably one
with a blameless record

57:18.205 --> 57:23.284
so my house ceases to be
a topic of gossip, which is
really what this is all about.

57:23.285 --> 57:27.644
Well, if Ethel wants to be part of
her son's life, even a little part,

57:27.645 --> 57:29.404
who are we to stand in her way?

57:29.405 --> 57:34.164
If you'd had to sell Charlie
to the butcher to be chopped up
as stew to achieve the same ends,

57:34.165 --> 57:35.804
you would have done so.

57:35.805 --> 57:38.005
Well, happily it was not needed.

57:44.076 --> 57:45.556
Howzat!

58:14.760 --> 58:15.920
Well shot, sir!

58:20.440 --> 58:23.000
Well played, Barrow. Thank you.
Excellent innings.

58:23.960 --> 58:27.039
I thought I was helping him
get out of our lives for good.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.279
Now he ranks higher than I do.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.240
I've been a damned fool.

58:32.800 --> 58:37.120
By the way, what was that phrase
he gave you to say to Miss O'Brien?

58:37.840 --> 58:39.719
You can tell me now, surely.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.439
If you keep it under your hat.

58:42.440 --> 58:45.079
It was "her ladyship's soap".
What?

58:45.080 --> 58:48.599
I can't make any sense of it either,
but that's what he said.

58:48.600 --> 58:50.480
"Her ladyship's soap."

58:51.480 --> 58:53.560
And it worked.

58:56.320 --> 58:59.359
It's down to you, Molesley,
last man in.

58:59.360 --> 59:02.879
We're in good shape thanks to Barrow,
but we could do with a bonus.

59:02.880 --> 59:06.119
Don't worry, I'll show them
a thing or two. That's the spirit.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.519
Well done, Papa. I did my best.
We'll just have to hope it's enough.

59:09.520 --> 59:13.280
Anna says we are to expect
great things of Molesley. Ah.

59:20.520 --> 59:22.760
Out!

59:24.840 --> 59:26.240
Well bowled.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.799
As usual, our expectations
are disappointed.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.200
Let's have some tea!

59:35.720 --> 59:37.639
Who gave me away?

59:37.640 --> 59:39.359
Was it you? Certainly not!

59:39.360 --> 59:43.760
In case you don't know,
I'm being sent north tomorrow
with a monster for a jailer!

59:44.960 --> 59:46.679
Well, what did she expect,

59:46.680 --> 59:50.519
carrying on with a married man
as if her home were in a tree?

59:50.520 --> 59:52.160
Granny, who told you?

59:53.160 --> 59:56.079
How could you have done that,
after you promised?

59:56.080 --> 59:58.919
But Mama said YOU told her.
I just filled in the details.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.399
I never said a word!

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.439
Have you tricked me, Mama?
Tricked? I'm not a conjurer.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:09.199
I only did what was necessary to
preserve the honour of the family.
In other words, you tricked me.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.920
James!

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.959
You put up a very good show out
there. Well done. Thank you, m'lord.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:20.159
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to thank you
for your generosity with Barrow.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.999
Letting him stay on
shows a real largeness of spirit.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.559
Stay on?

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.239
Mr Barrow's staying on?
As under-butler.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.759
I was given the impression
you'd allowed it.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.759
I allowed him to have
a decent reference when he left.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.079
But you won't mind too much,
will you?

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.199
Oh, by the way, congratulations
on your appointment as first footman.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.440
What?

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.640
Thank you, m'lord. Very much.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.799
Lord Grantham, I believe.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.079
The same.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.280
Looking for a Mr Alfred Nugent,
my lord.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.800
And you are...? Inspector Stanford
and Sergeant Brand, York Police.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.439
Alfred can't have got into trouble
with the police. That's not possible.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.559
He's made a complaint
concerning a Mr Thomas Barrow,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.599
making an assault of a... criminal
nature on another of your employees.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.799
That is a very serious allegation.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.439
Serious enough to bring us here
to interrupt your cricket match.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.319
If you'd point out
the young gentleman.
He's over... I'll fetch him.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.879
We'll go with you. I think it's
better to leave it to his lordship.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.000
I'm sure he can get
to the bottom of it.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.559
But I know what I saw,
and it weren't right.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.599
I'm not asking you to abandon
your beliefs, Alfred,

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.439
just to introduce a little kindness
into the equation.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.879
Am I not to stand up against evil?
Evil?

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.679
Thomas does not choose
to be the way he is.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.640
And what harm was done, really, that
his life should be destroyed for it?

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.319
Well... Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.360
Are you without sin, Alfred?
For I am certainly not.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.959
Sorry about your son, Mr Molesley.
Don't be.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.999
He talks such a lovely game. He could
always talk a good game of cricket.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
He just couldn't play it.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.239
Just as I thought.
There's been a mix-up.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.039
Alfred here witnessed
some rough-housing between two
of the staff and misinterpreted it.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.120
Why did you make the telephone call
without checking your facts?

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.280
I'm very much afraid to say he was
a bit squiffy. Weren't you, Alfred?

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.439
I made the call
before I knew what I were doing.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.479
I'd been at the cider.
You'd what?!

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.159
Oh, I think we can
overlook it this once.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.960
Don't you, Carson?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.799
So there's nothing to investigate.
I'm terribly sorry to have wasted
your time.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.440
Would you care to have some tea?

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.719
No, thank you, Lord Grantham.
I think we've got the measure of it.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.720
Good luck with your match.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.559
Where is Nanny?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.599
Gone to get some baby paraphernalia.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.959
Shall I tell her
you're looking for her?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.440
No.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.400
No, I'll be here anyway.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.520
You're very good to play.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.640
I don't know why
I made such a fuss about it.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.040
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.159
If I were to say I'd live with you
while Sybbie's little,

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.679
and that we wouldn't move out
until she's older,

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.360
would you mind?
I should be delighted.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.640
And I know
it's what Sybil would want.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.880
I think you're right.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.799
Tom says Robert's ready
to get behind the plan.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.639
I'm glad.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.239
So we'll be building a new kingdom
while we make our little prince.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.639
I'm looking forward to both
enormously.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.000
Right, gentlemen! Time's up!

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.760
We're about to start again.

01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:48.679
I hope I can count on you
not to laugh when I drop the ball.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.960
You can always count on me.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.360
I know that.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.999
I didn't think it was possible
to love as much as I love you.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.759
Matthew, hurry up!
You're keeping everyone waiting!

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.000
I've got to go.
Of course you have.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.239
Tom seems to think
you might be coming round.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.839
Well, he's brought me round,
more like, but yes.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.599
All right.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.440
Let's give it a go
and see what the future brings.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.240
Thank you.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.880
Catch it!

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.120
Great stuff.
