WEBVTT

00:04.875 --> 00:05.739
- Oh!
- This is so awesome!

00:05.770 --> 00:07.243
- It's a dream come true!
- What's going on?

00:07.244 --> 00:10.713
Me and Ally are both up for
Worldwide Music Awards!

00:10.714 --> 00:15.217
They just announced it!

00:15.218 --> 00:16.169
We're nominated against each
other for best debut album!

00:16.184 --> 00:16.685
No way! I can't believe it!

00:16.686 --> 00:19.488
Why would they nominate Ally?

00:19.489 --> 00:19.989
Dez!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.891
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What's done is done.

00:21.892 --> 00:23.192
- Congrats, guys.
- Yeah!

00:23.193 --> 00:25.427
Whoo!

00:25.428 --> 00:27.396
Oh!

00:27.397 --> 00:29.917
Trish texted me that she's on her
way over with a huge surprise.

00:32.569 --> 00:34.837
Aw! She'll be so bummed
we already know.

00:34.838 --> 00:36.839
Coming in here with big
news is kind of her thing.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.208
Then we have to pretend
we don't know.

00:40.877 --> 00:42.411
Great news, guys.

00:42.412 --> 00:45.214
Guess who's nominated
for best debut album.

00:45.215 --> 00:47.983
- I have no idea.
- Who?

00:47.984 --> 00:49.919
- Both of you!
- No way!

00:49.920 --> 00:51.987
Are you serious?

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.739 --> 01:11.100
You guys already
knew, didn't you?

01:12.876 --> 01:13.876
Yeah, we read it online.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.535
I can't wait for the whole world
to know you're my girlfriend.

02:13.536 --> 02:16.939
Oh yeah. The W.M.A.S
will be the first time

02:16.940 --> 02:18.974
our fans know we're
officially a couple.

02:18.975 --> 02:19.709
Yeah.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.910
I can't wait to walk down
the red carpet together.

02:21.911 --> 02:24.046
Should we hold hands
or link arms?

02:24.047 --> 02:25.848
Should I be on your
left or your right?

02:25.849 --> 02:27.816
Oh, be on my left.
That's my good side.

02:27.817 --> 02:29.378
Or my right. That's
my other good side.

02:33.990 --> 02:36.892
Austin and Ally have
arrived at the red carpet.

02:36.893 --> 02:40.362
Oh, the dress? Armand Bianchi.

02:40.363 --> 02:42.865
The boyfriend, Austin Moon.

02:42.866 --> 02:45.768
Oh, you already have a celebrity
couple nickname for us?

02:45.769 --> 02:48.404
"Auslly"? Cool.

02:48.405 --> 02:50.105
Mwah.

02:50.106 --> 02:52.841
Oh, look at you two.

02:52.842 --> 02:55.844
We just came by to say we're
proud of you, Austin.

02:55.845 --> 02:58.781
- Thanks, mom.
- We're proud of you too, Ally.

02:58.782 --> 03:00.336
Don't want you to think
we're playing favorites.

03:00.360 --> 03:00.716
Right.

03:00.717 --> 03:03.385
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Moon.
That means a lot.

03:03.386 --> 03:04.420
- Bye now.
- See ya.

03:04.421 --> 03:05.487
Bye.

03:07.778 --> 03:10.459
It's great how they're not
playing favorites, huh?

03:10.460 --> 03:12.461
It's okay.

03:12.462 --> 03:15.130
You should see what my
dad did to your poster.

03:19.002 --> 03:22.838
Huh. You think I look
good with a mustache?

03:28.778 --> 03:34.850
Well, my schedule's pretty full,
but I'll try to squeeze you in.

03:34.851 --> 03:37.019
Okay, bye, Beyonce.

03:38.955 --> 03:41.623
Oh my gosh. That was Beyonce.

03:41.624 --> 03:45.027
Ever since Austin and Ally got
nominated for a W.M.A. Award,

03:45.028 --> 03:47.596
all these stars wanna meet
with me about managing them!

03:47.597 --> 03:49.164
Are you taking on new talent?

03:49.165 --> 03:51.767
'Cause you know my neighbor's cat?
He can meow the alphabet.

03:51.768 --> 03:54.903
Ma, b, c, d, me, f, g,

03:54.904 --> 03:56.114
h, mi, j, k...

03:56.145 --> 03:56.805
Dez.

03:56.806 --> 03:58.006
Have the cat call me.

03:59.742 --> 04:01.983
Hey, where's Carrie? I thought
she was working the store.

04:04.047 --> 04:07.816
Yeah, she's in the back setting up drum
kits. I don't think she's doing it right.

04:09.652 --> 04:12.821
Oh. Babe, you have a
drum on your head again.

04:14.691 --> 04:16.658
This time it's on purpose.

04:16.659 --> 04:18.627
I didn't want anyone
to see me crying.

04:18.628 --> 04:19.648
Why? What's wrong?

04:19.678 --> 04:22.331
I don't know how to say
this, so I wrote it down.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.968
"I'm moving to Los Angeles."

04:27.971 --> 04:29.251
What? I'm moving to Los Angeles?

04:32.876 --> 04:34.943
But I don't want to.
I'll miss you too much.

04:34.944 --> 04:38.013
Dez, Carrie is moving
to Los Angeles.

04:38.014 --> 04:40.749
Oh, that's great! We're
both moving to Los Angeles!

04:40.750 --> 04:42.518
We'll still be together.

04:42.519 --> 04:44.199
No, Dezzy. I'm leaving
and you're staying.

04:46.723 --> 04:50.993
My dad got a job out there and I'm
leaving at the end of the week.

04:50.994 --> 04:51.994
That's awful.

04:54.864 --> 04:56.344
Can you... can you
excuse me a second?

05:09.612 --> 05:12.714
Austin and Ally, I
heard the great news.

05:12.715 --> 05:15.250
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

05:15.251 --> 05:17.719
What the heck are you two doing?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.222
Nothing much. What the
heck are you doing?

05:20.223 --> 05:23.125
I mean why do you have
your arm around her?

05:23.126 --> 05:25.861
Oh! Me and Ally are
back together.

05:25.862 --> 05:28.263
We're officially announcing
it at the W.M.A.S!

05:28.264 --> 05:30.232
We're walking down the
red carpet together.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.801
We decided on
left-link, right side.

05:32.802 --> 05:34.903
I have no idea what that means.

05:34.904 --> 05:37.773
But, Austin, you can't
have a girlfriend.

05:37.774 --> 05:39.608
Do you know what that
could do to your career?

05:39.609 --> 05:42.277
- Make it better?
- Try again.

05:42.278 --> 05:45.747
You have millions of
teenage girl fans.

05:45.748 --> 05:48.217
If they think you're single,
they'll buy more of your albums.

05:48.218 --> 05:52.154
So selling records and
making millions of dollars

05:52.155 --> 05:54.156
is more important to
you than my happiness?

05:54.157 --> 05:55.877
Never mind, I just
answered my own question.

05:58.294 --> 06:00.062
Let me put it this way.

06:00.063 --> 06:02.564
No one can know you're a couple,

06:02.565 --> 06:05.634
and you're definitely not going
to the W.M.A.S together.

06:05.635 --> 06:08.070
- But...
- End of discussion.

06:17.914 --> 06:20.549
What does Jimmy expect us to do?

06:20.550 --> 06:23.018
Pretend like we're not a couple
for the rest of our lives?

06:23.019 --> 06:25.153
How are we supposed to
be in a relationship

06:25.154 --> 06:27.823
if we have to spend all our
time acting like we're not?

06:27.824 --> 06:29.665
I was so excited to go
to the W.M.A.S with you.

06:31.594 --> 06:32.661
Maybe we still can.

06:34.731 --> 06:36.965
If we can prove to Jimmy
that we can be together

06:36.966 --> 06:40.135
in public without acting like a
couple, he'll have to let us go.

06:40.136 --> 06:41.217
Great idea. We can do that!

06:46.109 --> 06:47.309
Okay, we can't do that.

06:49.779 --> 06:51.947
We weren't even trying.

06:51.948 --> 06:54.249
Let's start now.
This'll be easy.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.250
Way easy.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.281
Okay, this is hard.

07:14.103 --> 07:16.071
I just can't believe
Carrie left already.

07:18.141 --> 07:20.501
I know it's rough, but long-distance
relationships can work.

07:21.911 --> 07:23.245
Look at me and Jace.

07:23.246 --> 07:25.080
I haven't seen him
in months, and I...

07:25.081 --> 07:28.083
Miss him so much. I
gotta go call him!

07:36.292 --> 07:37.959
What are you doing?

07:37.960 --> 07:40.513
Trying to prove we can be
in public without acting

07:40.544 --> 07:43.065
like a couple so Jimmy won't
force us to break up.

07:43.066 --> 07:46.835
- Huh! How's that going?
- Mmm... not well.

07:56.012 --> 07:57.813
Dez, do you have to do that?

07:57.814 --> 08:01.116
Uh, yeah. I'm taping our big night so
that Carrie doesn't miss anything.

08:02.986 --> 08:08.957
And here's Trish, arriving to get
Ally for the Worldwide Music Awards.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.826
Doesn't she look beautiful?

08:10.827 --> 08:13.362
Oh, and here's Mr. Dawson.

08:13.363 --> 08:15.664
Doesn't he look handsome?

08:15.665 --> 08:17.733
And here's Ally.

08:17.734 --> 08:20.502
Doesn't she look like she needs
another hour to get ready?

08:21.070 --> 08:24.039
You look beautiful, Ally.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.976
Thanks, Trish. So do you.

08:27.977 --> 08:30.017
Are you okay that Austin's
going with Jimmy tonight?

08:32.715 --> 08:35.933
It's not exactly how I
pictured the biggest night

08:35.964 --> 08:39.087
of our lives, but I'm gonna
make the best of it.

08:39.087 --> 08:41.923
Hey, I'm up for
best debut album.

08:41.924 --> 08:45.127
Yeah, you are.

08:46.362 --> 08:47.530
And you're gonna win!

08:47.561 --> 08:53.035
And when you are up there accepting
your award, don't forget to mention

08:53.036 --> 08:55.037
Sonic Boom's having a
sale on trombones.

08:55.038 --> 08:56.438
Sure thing, dad.

08:56.439 --> 09:00.075
Oh, Ally, you look so beautiful.

09:00.076 --> 09:02.044
Here, these are from Austin.

09:02.045 --> 09:06.181
He feels just awful that you two can't
go to the award show together tonight.

09:06.182 --> 09:09.351
And he wanted us to remind you
that when you see him tonight,

09:09.352 --> 09:10.433
don't go anywhere near him.

09:11.187 --> 09:13.488
Can you believe Austin and Ally

09:16.225 --> 09:19.728
are competing against each
other for best debut album?

09:19.729 --> 09:21.797
We just wanted you
to know, Lester,

09:21.798 --> 09:24.065
that no matter who wins,
we're proud of both of them.

09:24.066 --> 09:25.200
Me too.

09:26.969 --> 09:29.037
- Ally's gonna win.
- She's going down!

09:29.038 --> 09:30.472
- Austin rules!
- Ally!

09:30.473 --> 09:34.509
- Austin!
- Ally!

09:34.510 --> 09:34.837
- Austin! Austin!
- Ally!

09:34.868 --> 09:36.144
Well, this is gonna
be a fun limo ride.

09:36.145 --> 09:39.347
- Ally! Ally!
- Austin! Austin!

09:44.921 --> 09:46.922
Can you believe this?

09:46.923 --> 09:49.357
You made it, Ally.
This is your night!

09:53.796 --> 09:55.931
Whoa! Is that Lady Gaga?

09:55.932 --> 09:57.466
Surprise!

09:57.467 --> 10:01.203
I know how much you miss Carrie,
so I flew her out here.

10:01.204 --> 10:06.074
You flew out Lady Gaga to be my
date because I missed Carrie?

10:06.075 --> 10:08.410
- Dezzy, it's me.
- Babe?!

10:09.045 --> 10:12.013
Wait. Trish, you did this?

10:14.083 --> 10:16.117
Ehh. I was just tired
of you moping around

10:16.118 --> 10:17.786
and asking me to hug
you all the time.

10:17.787 --> 10:19.907
Well, now you get a double hug.
Let's get her, Carrie.

10:20.857 --> 10:23.525
This is what I get for
doing something nice.

10:25.161 --> 10:30.065
Anyway, to get Carrie a ticket, I had
to say she was my newest client.

10:30.066 --> 10:34.269
People will definitely think she's an
outrageous pop star in that hideous outfit.

10:35.004 --> 10:36.304
You think it's hideous?

10:36.305 --> 10:39.274
I picked it out of my closet 'cause
it's the nicest thing I own.

10:39.275 --> 10:41.309
Uhh...

10:41.310 --> 10:43.945
"Hideous" is Greek
for "beautiful."

10:43.946 --> 10:45.547
Thanks, Ally.

10:45.548 --> 10:47.949
You're the most
hideous girl here.

10:52.555 --> 10:55.290
Whoo!

10:59.562 --> 11:02.130
Whoa. Ally...

11:02.131 --> 11:03.498
You look...

11:03.499 --> 11:05.000
Whoa.

11:05.001 --> 11:07.035
You look great, too.

11:07.036 --> 11:08.837
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh, I'm...

11:10.907 --> 11:15.043
Just telling my friend
that she looks nice.

11:15.044 --> 11:16.524
You look... cool, bro.

11:18.881 --> 11:20.815
You're not so bad either, bro.

11:27.089 --> 11:29.024
I hate that we have to do this.

11:29.025 --> 11:30.292
Well, me too.

11:30.293 --> 11:31.493
I just wanna be near you.

11:33.229 --> 11:34.296
TV camera!

11:34.297 --> 11:35.618
It's Austin Moon
and Ally Dawson.

11:37.066 --> 11:39.000
Hey, how about an interview?

11:39.001 --> 11:41.469
Get in here, you two.

11:41.470 --> 11:44.005
Well, I'm...

11:44.006 --> 11:47.509
I'm sensing a lot of
tension between you two.

11:47.510 --> 11:50.478
Uh, why would you say that?

11:50.479 --> 11:53.348
Because you're up
for the same award.

11:53.349 --> 11:56.217
Oh, right. That kind of tension.

11:56.218 --> 11:56.638
Uh-huh.

11:56.669 --> 11:59.290
Not the kind that comes from
trying to hide being a couple.

11:59.321 --> 12:01.356
'Cause we're not.

12:01.357 --> 12:03.477
Oh, great! There's still a
chance to snag him, ladies.

12:05.194 --> 12:07.495
Get in line.

12:07.496 --> 12:09.297
Oh, it's Jasmine Fierra.

12:09.298 --> 12:11.967
She's also up for
best debut album.

12:14.036 --> 12:15.516
Hey, Austin. Looking
cute, as always.

12:19.041 --> 12:23.011
I wrote a love song that would be
perfect for us to sing together.

12:23.012 --> 12:27.415
Uh, thanks, but if I was gonna sing a
love song, I'd probably sing it with...

12:27.416 --> 12:29.017
You...

12:30.186 --> 12:36.124
'Cause I don't have a girlfriend, so
it doesn't matter who I sing with.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.405
You heard it. Austin and Jasmine

12:39.562 --> 12:42.097
will be recording a new
love song together,

12:42.098 --> 12:43.978
and Austin and Ally are
definitely not a couple.

12:46.702 --> 12:49.070
Definitely not...

12:49.071 --> 12:50.171
- No.
- Bro.

12:57.146 --> 12:59.581
I'll see y'all for lunch
next week, ya hear?

13:02.985 --> 13:05.987
Why y'all talking like that?

13:05.988 --> 13:08.123
That was Lonely Highway.
They're huge in country music.

13:08.124 --> 13:10.992
And I reckon they want this
little filly to manage 'em.

13:10.993 --> 13:15.286
So you're pretending to be someone
you're not just to sign an artist?

13:15.317 --> 13:17.098
Of course not.

13:17.099 --> 13:20.635
Yo yo, there's kid reflux!
Holla!

13:24.306 --> 13:27.575
Jimmy! We have to talk.

13:27.576 --> 13:30.045
I don't wanna hide my
relationship with Ally anymore.

13:30.046 --> 13:33.014
Austin, I know you're upset,
but I know what I'm doing.

13:33.015 --> 13:35.650
You're up for one of the
biggest awards in music.

13:35.651 --> 13:37.686
Do you think you could've gotten
here tonight if it wasn't for me?

13:37.687 --> 13:40.989
No. I would've had
to ride my bike.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.692
That would've been awful.

13:43.693 --> 13:45.416
I do not look good
with helmet hair.

13:45.447 --> 13:46.995
I am not talking about my limo.

13:46.996 --> 13:50.632
Austin, since you signed with my label, you
are on the verge of being a superstar.

13:50.633 --> 13:54.402
But I don't wanna be a superstar
if I have to hurt Ally to do it.

13:54.403 --> 13:58.073
Look, Jimmy, I can't keep hiding
that she's my girlfriend.

13:58.074 --> 14:02.477
Well, you have to. I've invested too much
in your career to let you mess it up now.

14:02.478 --> 14:06.047
So if I don't listen to you, are
you gonna drop me from your label?

14:06.048 --> 14:08.083
Oh, I could do a lot
worse than that.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.085
You signed a contract
that gives me the rights

14:10.086 --> 14:12.454
to all your music over
the next 10 years.

14:12.455 --> 14:16.424
I won't let you record any songs,
release any albums or go on any tours.

14:16.425 --> 14:17.705
You'd stop me from making music?

14:19.662 --> 14:21.542
It'll be like you disappeared
from the business.

14:22.098 --> 14:24.499
So I have to choose between
Ally and my career?

14:32.041 --> 14:34.441
Ello ello. I just signed
a British boy band!

14:35.177 --> 14:36.745
Is now not a good time?

14:47.256 --> 14:49.376
I can't believe Jimmy said
he would do that to Austin.

14:52.161 --> 14:54.529
Shh! Show's starting.

14:54.530 --> 14:56.410
I know. Austin can't quit music.
It'll kill him.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.502
Uh, I said shh! Show's starting.

15:06.075 --> 15:13.081
Good evening. I'm Nikki Rush, and
welcome to the Worldwide Music Awards.

15:13.082 --> 15:14.582
Whoo! Whoo!

15:17.119 --> 15:18.559
I hate being a threat
to his career.

15:20.489 --> 15:21.723
What can you do?

15:21.724 --> 15:23.091
Oh, I know what you both can do.

15:23.092 --> 15:25.160
You can both shh!

15:25.161 --> 15:26.482
<i>And... oh, is that a halo?</i>

15:28.831 --> 15:31.099
- Oh, no, it's just Beyonce.
- Dez.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.667
Can you tell Austin
to meet me outside?

15:34.503 --> 15:35.603
Yeah.

15:35.604 --> 15:36.725
Austin, go outside!

15:39.141 --> 15:40.141
Shh!

15:45.314 --> 15:48.149
- What's going on?
- Trish told me what Jimmy said.

15:51.787 --> 15:53.788
I feel terrible.

15:53.789 --> 15:57.258
I don't wanna make you have to
choose between me and your career.

15:57.259 --> 15:59.561
I'm not going to.

15:59.562 --> 16:01.663
We'll figure it out.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.631
We just have to keep our
relationship a secret.

16:03.632 --> 16:08.403
Whenever we're in public,
or whenever Jimmy's around.

16:08.404 --> 16:10.338
Or whenever someone
has a camera,

16:10.339 --> 16:12.707
or a phone with a camera, or
whenever there's a window.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.309
Austin! That's crazy.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.030
Neither of us is gonna
be happy doing that.

16:18.747 --> 16:21.816
I know, but what are
we supposed to do?

16:21.817 --> 16:23.351
Maybe...

16:23.352 --> 16:24.853
We just aren't meant
to be together.

16:28.257 --> 16:29.618
Are you saying we
should break up?

16:31.193 --> 16:32.660
I... think it's for the best.

16:35.497 --> 16:38.299
Ally.

16:39.735 --> 16:42.804
Look, now's probably the
best time to do this.

16:42.805 --> 16:46.808
You're about to go back to the
studio, I'm about to go on tour.

16:46.809 --> 16:49.129
We aren't going to see each
other for three months, anyway.

16:50.279 --> 16:51.813
I... I don't wanna
lose you again.

16:58.354 --> 16:59.834
We'll still be in
each other's lives.

17:00.723 --> 17:02.290
We'll always be friends.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.194
Best friends.

17:18.307 --> 17:20.227
Hey, are you okay? You're
missing the whole show.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.644
Ally just broke up with me.

17:24.713 --> 17:26.948
Oh man, I'm really
sorry to hear that.

17:26.949 --> 17:28.869
I was gonna wait to tell
you this after the show,

17:30.819 --> 17:33.988
but since you're already really sad,
I guess now's a good a time as ever.

17:33.989 --> 17:35.723
Tell me what?

17:35.724 --> 17:37.992
You know how Carrie's
going back to L.A.?

17:37.993 --> 17:39.554
Well, I'm... kinda
going back with her.

17:41.830 --> 17:43.671
I'm gonna move out there
and go to film school.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.767
Whoa. What?

17:47.636 --> 17:49.470
You're moving out to L.A.?

17:49.471 --> 17:50.805
Yeah.

17:50.806 --> 17:52.540
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

17:57.746 --> 18:00.648
But I realized I have
to be with Carrie.

18:00.649 --> 18:03.584
I mean, without love, what's
the point of any of this?

18:06.889 --> 18:09.490
- Did you tell him yet?
- Yeah, he knows.

18:09.491 --> 18:11.571
Did he cry like a little
girl like you said he would?

18:13.362 --> 18:14.723
I never said that.

18:26.008 --> 18:31.980
And now it's time to
announce "Best Debut Album."

18:31.981 --> 18:33.014
The nominees are...

18:33.015 --> 18:34.136
Kid Reflux, "Hood Dreamz"...

18:36.285 --> 18:37.285
Jasmine Fierra, "Fierce,"

18:39.888 --> 18:43.558
Lonely Highway, "Rowdy
Mountain Monday,"

18:43.559 --> 18:46.861
Austin Moon, "Superhero"...

18:48.464 --> 18:49.897
Boo!

18:49.898 --> 18:51.219
And Ally Dawson, "Finally Me."

18:54.503 --> 18:56.671
Boo!

18:56.672 --> 19:00.842
And the award for best
debut album goes to...

19:01.443 --> 19:04.412
"Fierce"! Jasmine Fierra!

19:13.989 --> 19:17.592
Thank you. They always
say that it's an honor

19:17.593 --> 19:22.597
just to be nominated, but the truth
is winning is so much better!

19:22.598 --> 19:24.565
It's been a long...

19:24.566 --> 19:27.668
I know you're upset about Ally,
but everything I make you do

19:27.669 --> 19:29.103
is to help you get
up there some day.

19:29.104 --> 19:32.540
Just standing in front
of you tonight.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.008
<i>First I'd like to thank my...</i>

19:34.009 --> 19:35.889
Why wait for someday when
I can go up there now?

19:36.478 --> 19:37.678
What are you doing?

19:42.718 --> 19:47.455
Um, sorry, Jasmine, can I
borrow that for a sec?

19:47.456 --> 19:49.057
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19:49.058 --> 19:50.179
Love your album, by the way.

19:50.959 --> 19:53.428
Hey, everybody.

19:54.696 --> 19:55.963
I have something to say.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.669
By doing this, I could be
throwing away my career...

20:01.670 --> 20:02.937
But I don't care anymore.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.441
A good friend once told me,

20:07.810 --> 20:09.690
"without love, what's the
point of any of this?"

20:11.980 --> 20:13.548
Whoo!

20:13.549 --> 20:15.383
I can't hide it anymore.

20:17.753 --> 20:21.989
When I came here tonight, I was so
excited to tell the world that...

20:21.990 --> 20:23.291
I have a girlfriend...

20:24.960 --> 20:26.894
And her name is Ally Dawson.

20:28.664 --> 20:30.731
<i>Whoo!</i>

20:30.732 --> 20:31.966
Ally...

20:31.967 --> 20:35.103
When I first met you, I
had no idea that you'd

20:35.134 --> 20:38.039
be the best thing that
ever happened to me.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.480
I can't imagine my
life without you.

20:41.143 --> 20:42.810
I love you, Ally.

20:45.881 --> 20:46.881
I love you too, Austin.

21:11.874 --> 21:13.641
So I talked to Jimmy again...

21:13.642 --> 21:15.943
He still won't budge.

21:15.944 --> 21:17.904
I don't think you'll be
making music anytime soon.

21:18.614 --> 21:21.295
Look on the bright side. Your contract
with Jimmy is up in 10 years.

21:23.852 --> 21:26.687
That'll give you plenty of
time to write your next album.

21:26.688 --> 21:28.689
I feel better already.

21:28.690 --> 21:33.361
It stinks, but I already made my
choice, and it was the right one.

21:34.963 --> 21:37.231
I can't wait to hang
with you on your tour.

21:39.468 --> 21:41.969
We're gonna have so much fun.

21:41.970 --> 21:45.840
I packed five suitcases full of
books for us to read on the bus!

21:45.841 --> 21:49.777
Aww. I thought you said
we were gonna have fun.

21:49.778 --> 21:51.538
I'm really gonna miss
having you as a client.

21:52.981 --> 21:54.782
But not that I'm hurting.

21:54.783 --> 21:57.785
I landed so many artists
after the W.M.A.S,

21:57.786 --> 21:59.720
I'm starting my own
management company.

21:59.721 --> 22:01.189
I can finally quit my day jobs!

22:01.190 --> 22:02.924
- That's awesome!
- Good for you!

22:02.925 --> 22:04.625
So that's why you're
dressed nice for a change.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.961
Well, we better get going.
Our tour bus is waiting.

22:10.499 --> 22:13.034
I should go too. I've
got a plane to catch.

22:13.035 --> 22:15.803
Carrie's already waiting for
me at the airport in L.A.

22:15.804 --> 22:19.106
Already? You don't land
for like six hours.

22:19.107 --> 22:21.042
I know, but she likes to
hang out at baggage claim

22:21.043 --> 22:24.978
and watch the luggage go round and
round and round and round and round...

22:25.009 --> 22:25.947
We got it.

22:25.948 --> 22:29.884
Well, we're gonna miss you, Dez.

22:29.885 --> 22:32.553
We'll see you when
Ally's tour gets to L.A.

22:32.554 --> 22:34.188
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'll be there, too.

22:34.189 --> 22:36.891
I'm going to L.A. on
holiday with the boy band.

22:36.892 --> 22:39.594
Perhaps we'll have a spot of
tea with some record labels.

22:44.933 --> 22:47.101
It's so good. I can't wait.

22:50.072 --> 22:52.573
- I love you guys.
- I love you.

22:52.574 --> 22:54.041
- We better get going.
- Okay, come on. Come on.

22:54.042 --> 22:58.179
Dez, please. Do you
have everything?

22:58.180 --> 23:02.136
I just have that feeling
I forgot something.

23:02.167 --> 23:06.210
- You probably did.
- It's okay.

23:10.859 --> 23:12.193
You ready to do this?

23:12.194 --> 23:14.095
Yeah. I am.
