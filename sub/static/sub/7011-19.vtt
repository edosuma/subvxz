WEBVTT

00:09.175 --> 00:11.666
Oh, my first X-rated movie.

00:13.947 --> 00:17.439
I don't know what's going on,
but that is the luckiest pizza boy ever.

00:19.586 --> 00:23.454
Yeah, I'll say. There's at least
nine boobs in this shot alone.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.357
Guys, I feel bad.
I mean, Jackie finally takes me back...

00:27.427 --> 00:31.488
and I reward her by sneaking off
to see some trashy porno babes.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.124
Oh, wow!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.998
That seems like it would tickle.

00:37.070 --> 00:41.029
Oh, nothing's going to happen in this scene.
It's just two ladies.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.773
Oh, bravo, nice plot twist.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.283
All right, guys, I gotta go.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.618
I don't think Jackie would
like me being here.

00:56.689 --> 00:59.214
And you should pick up
your dress on the way out.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.323
Oh, wow!

01:06.399 --> 01:08.799
Does everyone do that?

01:08.868 --> 01:12.634
Because I don't do that.

01:12.705 --> 01:15.799
I just stick to
two or three key moves and...

01:17.143 --> 01:19.839
God, they don't even
come close to that.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.973
Oh, Eric, I have not
done anything...

01:23.049 --> 01:27.110
but even I, had I done anything,
would have already done that.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.620
Jackie, you know I love you...

02:07.694 --> 02:10.185
and you know how much
I've changed, right?

02:10.263 --> 02:13.096
Yeah?

02:13.166 --> 02:16.033
Oh, what'd you do?

02:16.102 --> 02:18.093
I went to a stag film.

02:18.171 --> 02:21.231
But then it turned out
that there weren't any stags at all.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.539
It was just naked people
having sex.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.046
Go ahead and punish me.

02:28.114 --> 02:31.015
No, Michael,
I'm not gonna punish you.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.552
You were honest with me,
and honesty should be rewarded.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.815
Wow. I'm not in trouble
and I get a reward?

02:39.592 --> 02:42.720
Is it a cash reward?

02:42.795 --> 02:46.526
No, Michael, the reward
is feeling better about yourself.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.499
Oh.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.806
Mmm, smells good.
Whatcha making?

02:54.874 --> 02:57.138
Oh, a little lemon meringue
and pot roast...

02:57.210 --> 02:59.940
and my sister Paula is coming
and seven-layer salad.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.109
Ahh. Seven-lay...
Hey, wait a second.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.551
Red, now please, be nice.
We haven't seen her in almost six years.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.284
- Yeah, not since she got arrested.
- No, not arrested, detained.

03:13.993 --> 03:18.225
She showed up in the backseat
of a police car with lights flashing.

03:18.298 --> 03:22.792
I had to tell the neighbors
that she was the mayor of Cincinnati.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.337
Oh, there she is.

03:25.405 --> 03:29.136
You wait. She's gonna hit me up
for money like she always does.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.816
That's gonna cost me.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.226
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- Kitty!

03:56.302 --> 03:58.236
Oh, my God!
Look at you!

03:58.304 --> 04:01.102
I know, I know,
I'm fabulous.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.305
- Look, huh, at me.
- Oh, my God.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.940
You're wearing stockings.
Red, she's wearing stockings.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.747
Oh, oh, and matching shoes!

04:13.820 --> 04:18.519
Oh, come on, Red.
I know you're dying for a nibble.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.048
Paula, you're so pink.

04:22.128 --> 04:27.862
Oh, well, sure, sure.
I gotta match my brand-new car.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.868
Go ahead, pet her.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.302
Well, ooh, ooh,
I wanna pet her too.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.645
Why did you paint it
with Pepto-Bismol?

04:41.714 --> 04:45.878
It's not Pepto-Bismol.
It's Luscious Blushes.

04:45.952 --> 04:50.616
And only the top Kathy May
salesperson gets one of these babies.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.817
So you stole it from her?

04:52.892 --> 04:57.090
I have all the money that I owe you.
Here it is.

04:57.163 --> 05:01.566
Oh, my God. You have cash.
Red, she has cash.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.467
Honey, Red, Red, Red,
really, you don't have to count it.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.407
Oh, well, of course.
You're family.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.173
Oh, honey, honey, honey!

05:14.247 --> 05:18.445
Honesty's cool, man.
It's like I can do anything wrong...

05:18.518 --> 05:21.783
and then ask for forgiveness,
and then I'm good again.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.186
I mean, someone should invent
a religion like that.

05:25.958 --> 05:29.450
Okay, so did anyone besides me
think that some of the guys in that movie...

05:29.529 --> 05:33.522
were not completely... average?

05:34.934 --> 05:38.335
Like, you know,
they were way, way...

05:38.404 --> 05:40.338
above average?

05:41.941 --> 05:45.900
Well, you don't go into that line of work
when you're below average.

05:45.978 --> 05:50.608
You just pray some hot, redheaded neighbor
girl likes you for your personality.

05:52.552 --> 05:56.079
What are you talking about?
Those men were completely average.

05:56.155 --> 05:59.352
In fact, I found the guy
with the mustache downright puny.

06:01.227 --> 06:04.685
See now, Fez, that's not honest.

06:04.764 --> 06:08.666
I mean, we all know
you're small in the pants.

06:08.735 --> 06:12.762
What I'm saying is, is from here on in,
I'm only telling the truth.

06:12.839 --> 06:16.002
In fact, I'm gonna come clean
to Jackie about everything.

06:17.710 --> 06:21.874
Fine. You want honesty?
I'll give you honesty.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.348
We are all small in the pants.

06:27.653 --> 06:32.022
Kelso, this might be your best idea ever.
You know what?

06:32.091 --> 06:36.528
You should make a list of all the lies
you've ever told to Jackie, and I'll help you.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.997
'Cause all's I really want
is for you to be happy.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.534
Hey, you guys, honestly...

06:42.602 --> 06:46.766
you don't think Donna's,
you know, bored, right?

06:46.839 --> 06:50.297
'Cause those guys in the movie,
they didn't do the same move twice.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.209
And I've done
the same move, like...

06:53.279 --> 06:55.213
always.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.109
I'll bet they go to a special school
or something.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.153
I mean, they're like
doctors at doing it.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.622
<i>Eric, dinner.</i>

07:04.690 --> 07:08.751
Oh, no.
Now I have to act normal.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.631
But I get to eat, yeah!

07:24.977 --> 07:27.707
- Aunt Paula, you look great.
- Oh.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.374
And so pink.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.350
Oh, Eric, you're so cute.

07:32.418 --> 07:35.410
Here's 20 bucks.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.649
Aunt Paula is awesome!

07:39.725 --> 07:43.024
So, Paula, tell me more
about the ship captain.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.188
Oh, that was just
a fling, you know.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.789
Didn't you have a fiancÃ©
the last time we saw you?

07:47.867 --> 07:51.394
Red, now there is no reason
to rehash ancient history, is there?

07:51.471 --> 07:56.636
No, it's okay. It turned out he lived
on some sort of commune...

07:56.709 --> 07:58.802
where everyone called him God.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.244
And there were... there were guns.

08:01.314 --> 08:06.013
And I really could never figure out
why God would need a gun.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.543
But there were
some fun parties. Whoo!

08:16.762 --> 08:19.754
That's hilarious!

08:19.832 --> 08:24.292
Life has gotten so much better
since I moved to Indianapolis.

08:24.370 --> 08:28.204
I mean, things move
so much faster in the big city.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.742
One day you're wondering
if you'll ever find happiness...

08:30.810 --> 08:35.509
and the next, you're waving
the starting flag at the Indy 500.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.518
- You waved the Indy flag?
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.586 --> 08:44.317
Oh, God, you're the coolest.

08:44.390 --> 08:48.622
Mom, how funny is it
that while Aunt Paula was at Indy...

08:48.694 --> 08:51.891
you were probably
at, like, Price Mart.

08:57.503 --> 09:02.031
Ooh, ooh, ooh, who wants pie?
It's meringue.

09:02.108 --> 09:06.977
Well, enough about me.
Kitty, dear, what have you been up to?

09:07.046 --> 09:09.378
Well, you know,
it's funny you should ask...

09:09.448 --> 09:12.042
because we have been
super, super busy.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.645
Oh, no, she quit her job. She's not
up to anything. It's kind of boring.

09:15.721 --> 09:20.454
So, did you meet Dick Trickle?

09:20.526 --> 09:22.619
Eric!

09:28.367 --> 09:31.131
What? He's a race car driver.

09:31.203 --> 09:34.570
His name is Dick Trickle.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.406
Oh, my God, listen to my voice!
I'm so loud!

09:47.687 --> 09:52.954
Oh, well, will you look at this?
Here's me, captain of the cheerleaders.

09:53.025 --> 09:56.756
"Most likely to succeed."
"Best laugh."

10:00.399 --> 10:02.333
Oh, here's Paula.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.436
What's that on her cheek?

10:05.504 --> 10:09.167
Oh, she had a little sledding accident
with her face that year.

10:09.241 --> 10:12.233
- Typical.
- I know.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.444
Things were so different then.

10:20.519 --> 10:23.750
Kitty, oh! You so deserve this.
You're the best.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.792
Oh, aren't you sweet?

10:29.528 --> 10:32.019
Boy, oh, boy,
Chet sure is lucky.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.089
He's got the keenest girl in school.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.464
Oh, stop!

10:36.535 --> 10:39.402
- Congratulations, Kitty.
- Thanks, Paula.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.497
I knew you'd win.
You always do.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.975
- No, not always.
- Well, I want a kiss from the queen.

10:45.044 --> 10:50.107
Well, Chet, you have been
an awfully loyal subject.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.083
You guys, I'd like you
to meet my date, Marvin.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.656
Marvin? Sweetie? Sweetie?

10:59.859 --> 11:01.793
Okay.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.227
Okay.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.239
And now, I'm a housewife...

11:15.307 --> 11:20.074
and she goes on cruises
with Dick Trickle.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.943
You don't know
what she's not telling you.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.507
I mean, just because
she's more successful than you...

11:26.585 --> 11:28.746
doesn't mean that she's happy.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.958
More successful?

11:34.026 --> 11:36.995
Well, it's just
that she has so many...

11:38.297 --> 11:41.824
And she's... she's very...

11:41.901 --> 11:44.927
Look, money.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.502
I love it when you do that.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.773
Good to know.
Good to know.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.977
And how about when I do this?

12:06.425 --> 12:09.053
<i>Geez, Eric, what the hell?</i>

12:09.128 --> 12:11.756
Okay, okay, I'll just
go back up to the ear.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.459
Get away from me, you pig!

12:14.533 --> 12:16.592
Where are my pants?

12:16.669 --> 12:21.436
Wait. Wait, it was an accident.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.532
Look, I have a feather.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.252
He did?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.254
What the heck for?

12:37.322 --> 12:39.256
I don't know.

12:40.893 --> 12:44.829
In like what universe
is that sexy?

12:44.897 --> 12:49.561
Only one... the skinny,
pervert universe.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.368
It was just so strange.

12:54.439 --> 12:57.567
I mean, usually he just sticks to,
like, two or three key moves.

12:59.711 --> 13:02.407
You know, I bet it's because
of that nudie flick they saw yesterday.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.217
They went to an X-rated movie?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.617
Didn't Eric tell you?

13:08.687 --> 13:10.484
No.

13:14.259 --> 13:17.023
God, why would Eric
go see something like that?

13:17.095 --> 13:19.154
I mean, is our sex life
so boring...

13:19.231 --> 13:22.723
that he has to sneak around
and watch other people do it?

13:22.801 --> 13:25.599
Donna, of course it is.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.435
It's okay.

13:36.381 --> 13:40.943
So, um, what's going on here?

13:41.019 --> 13:45.820
Packing a picnic lunch
for your next African safari?

13:45.891 --> 13:49.725
No, I thought I'd make
my strudel for the boys.

13:49.795 --> 13:53.526
It feels nice
having people to cook for.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.826
Huh.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.268
Well, um...

13:59.338 --> 14:01.272
Sounds like your, uh...

14:01.340 --> 14:04.036
jet-set life
gets pretty lonely, huh?

14:04.109 --> 14:06.703
- Oh, no, I have lots of friends.
- Oh, right, right.

14:06.778 --> 14:09.713
But, um, all the friends
in the world...

14:09.781 --> 14:13.877
don't make up for having to come home
from the Bahamas to an empty house, do they?

14:13.952 --> 14:17.388
I actually enjoy my privacy.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.482
Hmm, privacy.

14:20.559 --> 14:24.393
Loneliness.
It's a fine line, isn't it?

14:24.463 --> 14:27.330
Okay, Kitty, is something wrong?

14:27.399 --> 14:30.766
Yeah, something is wrong.
Why are you here?

14:30.836 --> 14:32.861
Because I missed you.

14:32.938 --> 14:37.170
And I wanted you to see
that I'm finally okay.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.870
Okay or better than me?

14:39.945 --> 14:43.711
Better than you?
Oh, Kitty, you're my sister and...

14:43.782 --> 14:48.947
Fine. I'm finally a success, and I wanted
to come back and rub your face in it.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.751
And I did, and I liked it!

15:00.565 --> 15:03.500
Well, good for you.

15:03.568 --> 15:08.267
It must have been hard living in my shadow,
because I was popular and you weren't.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.776
And I had a life and you didn't.
That's right. I said it.

15:11.843 --> 15:15.574
You heard me.
You were a schlub. A schlub!

15:23.588 --> 15:25.988
Oh, I am so sorry.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.526
Oh, I'm sorry too.

15:28.593 --> 15:32.120
Oh, I just... I don't know
what is the matter with me.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.722
- I know.
- I should be just thrilled...

15:34.800 --> 15:37.394
that you're finally on your feet,
and instead, I'm just...

15:37.469 --> 15:39.937
I'm acting like
a jealous little ninny.

15:40.005 --> 15:43.600
Kitty, would you like a makeover?

15:43.675 --> 15:46.974
Oh, I really would.

15:47.045 --> 15:48.808
Okay.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.145
I-I won't look like a whore, will I?

15:53.819 --> 15:56.982
No, no, I promise.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.214
Okay, Jackie.

15:59.291 --> 16:03.887
There are some things I haven't been honest
about that I feel like you should know.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.328
Okay.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.832
Why are they here?

16:08.900 --> 16:12.734
Well, Hyde helpfully pointed out
that it's not really honesty...

16:12.804 --> 16:15.671
unless your friends
are allowed to watch.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.406
So, anyway, I made a list.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.915
The list was my idea.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.974
Thank you for that, Hyde.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.680
Okay, so let's just get started.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.918
Um, that picture you saw
of me in kindergarten?

16:32.991 --> 16:36.757
Those weren't puffy pants.
It was a big boy diaper.

16:40.699 --> 16:44.328
And that time you came out of the shower,
and you thought you saw a flash?

16:44.402 --> 16:46.336
I did take your picture.

16:50.308 --> 16:53.141
This one time you asked me
if you had anything in your teeth?

16:53.211 --> 16:56.510
And you did, but I said no,
'cause it's funnier that way.

17:03.021 --> 17:06.479
When we were about to fool around,
and I said that I washed my hands?

17:06.558 --> 17:09.857
But really I just got done
playing with like six dogs.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.369
- But that's not as bad...
- All right, Michael, stop!

17:20.438 --> 17:24.840
Okay, Michael, I think we need
to work on selective honesty.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.002
Yes, that and basic hygiene.

17:30.982 --> 17:34.247
Seriously, good God, man.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.253
Okay, Michael...

17:36.321 --> 17:40.917
unless one of your secrets involves kissing
a girl, I don't need to know about it.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.228
Okay. All right.

17:44.296 --> 17:48.323
Oh, science fact.
Dogs are cleaner than humans.

17:52.470 --> 17:55.496
Oh, you poor pink bastard.

18:00.645 --> 18:03.045
<i>Well, well!</i>

18:03.114 --> 18:05.514
What have we here?

18:08.553 --> 18:12.216
<i>All right. I got 20 minutes</i>
<i>till my wife comes back...</i>

18:12.290 --> 18:14.224
so, uh, pucker up.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.797
Okay, you two lovebirds.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.800
I'm off.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.029
Oh, bye-bye, Red. Oh!

18:25.103 --> 18:27.628
Oh, Paula, thank you so much.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.765
Oh, oh, Kitty.

18:29.841 --> 18:31.866
What are sisters for, huh?

18:31.943 --> 18:34.138
I'll talk to you
in a couple of days.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.271
And you remember what I said.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.915
<i>Oui, oui, ma soeur.</i>

18:51.863 --> 18:55.060
So what's with all the French?

18:55.133 --> 18:59.035
- Did she call me something?
- No.

18:59.104 --> 19:02.801
She said, "Search for life to live life,"
which is my new motto.

19:02.874 --> 19:04.808
Paula made me see
that I have been in a rut.

19:04.876 --> 19:09.279
But the good news is, from now on,
I am just going to explore life.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.416
But you're...

19:14.853 --> 19:20.052
You're all pretty now with your big red lips.
Isn't that enough?

19:20.125 --> 19:23.322
Oh, I love you, Red Forman.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.329
And no.

19:26.898 --> 19:31.926
All right, fine.
But if you paint my car pink, it's over.

19:39.778 --> 19:43.942
Oh, hey, I was
just looking at... Hey!

19:45.016 --> 19:49.248
Okay, where did you
get the idea to...

19:52.457 --> 19:55.824
do what you did?

19:55.894 --> 19:58.727
I went to see this movie...

19:58.797 --> 20:01.322
and it was a...

20:01.399 --> 20:03.458
Well, I guess you could
call it an art film.

20:03.535 --> 20:07.471
- Eric!
- Okay, fine, Donna. It was an X-rated film.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.565
And it just...
There were all these people...

20:10.642 --> 20:13.475
and they were doing all these things
that we've never done.

20:13.545 --> 20:18.847
And it seemed like they really
enjoyed doing this one thing especially.

20:18.917 --> 20:24.446
And I just thought, you know, who would
enjoy doing that one thing especially?

20:24.522 --> 20:26.615
My lady.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.193
Eric, listen to me...

20:30.261 --> 20:32.252
because this is
gosh-darn important.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.995
You don't do that,
not without asking.

20:39.137 --> 20:42.004
So, if I had asked...

20:42.073 --> 20:44.405
The answer's still no!

20:48.079 --> 20:49.876
Are you bored
with our sex life?

20:49.948 --> 20:52.815
Oh, God, no.
Just the opposite.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.818
I figured that you
had to be bored.

20:54.886 --> 20:59.289
And it was our hundredth time,
and I just wanted to do something special.

21:00.358 --> 21:02.952
Oh, my God, you count?

21:04.496 --> 21:06.430
No.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.090
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

21:12.804 --> 21:16.171
But do me a favor. Next time
you're gonna do something weird...

21:16.241 --> 21:19.335
gimme a little more warning,
so I can brace myself.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.908
Or tell you to back the hell off.

21:27.685 --> 21:30.984
- Right.
- Because no matter how much I love you...

21:31.056 --> 21:33.388
that was unpleasant.

21:38.863 --> 21:43.300
I'm sorry, you guys.
I can't hang out. I gotta go meet Jackie.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.929
Don't look at me like that.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.409
All right, five more minutes,
but that is it.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.877
Come on. Who wants to
show me their belly, huh?

21:54.946 --> 21:58.848
Come on.
Come here, buddy!

22:03.488 --> 22:06.753
Come here, baby.
Who's my little baby, huh?

22:06.825 --> 22:09.817
Who's my little baby?

22:10.305 --> 22:16.476
