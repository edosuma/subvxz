WEBVTT

00:03.973 --> 00:05.253
Buddy...

00:05.278 --> 00:08.146
Same time last year, I
bagged a 14-pointer on mine.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.274
Got 'em not a mile in with this baby.

00:14.091 --> 00:15.826
Not a good day to be in the woods.

00:15.893 --> 00:17.694
There's wolves about.

00:17.762 --> 00:19.214
Who the hell are you?

00:19.239 --> 00:20.467
No one.

00:20.658 --> 00:22.298
Why don't you go back
to grandma's house,

00:22.322 --> 00:23.633
Little Orange Riding Hood?

00:23.701 --> 00:25.660
You are trespassing on my land.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.470
So you're gonna get gone, now,

00:27.538 --> 00:29.606
or my friend here is
gonna call the police.

00:36.168 --> 00:38.752
My friends here don't want
the authorities involved.

00:42.587 --> 00:44.321
Please, hold on, we can talk about this!

00:50.294 --> 00:51.795
Mmm.

00:51.863 --> 00:53.997
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:54.065 --> 00:55.131
Did I wake you?

00:55.199 --> 00:57.834
No. I was out like a light.

00:57.902 --> 01:00.370
That air mattress is
surprisingly comfortable.

01:00.438 --> 01:03.306
Don't worry about that,
'cause I'm gonna have

01:03.460 --> 01:06.529
our bed and everything
else shipped over today.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.750
Did you do something
different with your hair?

01:10.774 --> 01:11.986
Well, do you like it?

01:12.053 --> 01:13.621
I love it.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.357
Hey, what's all this?

01:16.424 --> 01:17.794
Uh, nothing.

01:17.819 --> 01:18.941
Don't worry about that.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.527
These are all final notices.

01:20.928 --> 01:22.636
Kinda spent a lot of money.

01:22.735 --> 01:24.865
Trying to find you.

01:24.933 --> 01:26.963
How much?

01:27.075 --> 01:28.942
All of it.

01:29.104 --> 01:30.366
Yeah.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.174
Nearly had to sell the apartment
to get back in the black.

01:33.281 --> 01:35.422
It's all good now. We're
both back at work.

01:35.510 --> 01:38.097
Things'll be back to normal very soon.

01:39.581 --> 01:41.415
- What?
- Mm...

01:41.483 --> 01:42.593
What's wrong?

01:42.618 --> 01:44.485
I'm actually vegan now.

01:44.953 --> 01:46.883
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:46.908 --> 01:48.070
Okay.

01:48.095 --> 01:50.062
Well, all the monks in
Kathmandu were vegan,

01:50.092 --> 01:52.727
and then, you know, I
kind of really liked it.

01:53.128 --> 01:55.629
Mmm... mmm!

01:55.697 --> 01:56.964
Mmm.

01:57.032 --> 01:59.366
Any other surprises I
need to know about?

02:03.405 --> 02:05.551
None that I can think of.

02:05.651 --> 02:07.533
That's good.

02:08.943 --> 02:11.679
Stuart, how many processing
cores did you redirect?

02:11.746 --> 02:13.080
There's crazy lag in my system.

02:13.148 --> 02:16.383
Uh... technically, it
stopped being your system

02:16.411 --> 02:18.291
ever since you left to
create your Elftown App.

02:18.315 --> 02:20.826
Don't do that, Stuart. You
know it's called Elfville.

02:20.906 --> 02:23.257
Okay... it's called Wizardville.

02:23.325 --> 02:24.658
You both know that.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.726
It was number one in the
app store for seven weeks.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.652
Those jerks at Elftown couldn't even get

02:28.677 --> 02:30.029
first-round VC funding, so...

02:30.054 --> 02:31.788
All I'm saying is it's
kind of our lab now.

02:32.087 --> 02:34.672
A co-lab with a... a co-system.

02:34.736 --> 02:37.638
So let's quit sweating
the small stuff and...

02:37.706 --> 02:40.140
and focus all our energy
on this one tattoo

02:40.208 --> 02:41.775
that has been bugging me.

02:42.309 --> 02:44.144
One tattoo that has been bugging you

02:44.169 --> 02:45.436
is literally the small stuff.

02:45.461 --> 02:47.262
My system, the one I designed,

02:47.341 --> 02:48.981
is optimized for a holistic approach.

02:49.017 --> 02:51.585
Patterson, there's one
tattoo that's bugging me.

02:51.653 --> 02:52.820
I want to crack it today.

02:52.845 --> 02:54.239
Yeah! It's that easy.

02:54.264 --> 02:55.827
You decide on a tattoo you wanna crack,

02:55.914 --> 02:57.725
and the magic machine just cracks it.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.487
- Which one?
- Perseus.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.072
I think I solved some of it last night.

03:01.096 --> 03:02.272
You solved it on your own?

03:02.297 --> 03:04.565
I'm not just a handsome face, Tasha.

03:04.633 --> 03:07.593
All right. Uh, how did you solve it?

03:09.004 --> 03:11.105
- What are you doing here?
- I need a favor.

03:11.172 --> 03:12.506
Some help with the tattoos.

03:12.574 --> 03:13.767
What, are you insane?

03:13.834 --> 03:17.079
Maybe. But you are gonna help me.

03:17.104 --> 03:18.239
If I don't?

03:18.264 --> 03:20.715
I'll tell Jane what happened in Berlin.

03:22.210 --> 03:23.834
What do you need?

03:25.454 --> 03:27.181
I need it solved tomorrow.

03:27.289 --> 03:29.062
Or a lot of people are gonna die.

03:29.349 --> 03:31.415
I'm not gonna be your Trojan horse.

03:31.493 --> 03:33.261
I don't care about the FBI.

03:33.361 --> 03:35.796
Or burning down the world.

03:35.864 --> 03:37.364
I'm trying to help you save it.

03:37.432 --> 03:38.999
Keep telling yourself that.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.668
Jane's new tattoos are different.

03:41.067 --> 03:43.671
- There is a sequence to them.
- So maybe I jump ahead.

03:43.738 --> 03:46.073
I work out your end game,
and I take <i>you</i> down.

03:46.141 --> 03:47.903
Won't work.

03:48.116 --> 03:50.417
Try to climb too high, too fast...

03:50.471 --> 03:51.578
the whole thing crumbles.

03:51.646 --> 03:52.980
So, every now and then,

03:53.048 --> 03:55.816
I'm just gonna tell you
where to step next.

03:55.884 --> 03:58.118
Solve "Perseus."

03:58.186 --> 04:00.247
The answer's already in your hands.

04:01.577 --> 04:03.138
I was combing through the new tattoos.

04:03.163 --> 04:05.592
I noticed something strange
about Perseus's hands.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.753
He's got five fingers on his left hand,

04:07.778 --> 04:09.386
six on his right.

04:09.411 --> 04:10.644
11.

04:10.712 --> 04:12.640
What a math whiz you are.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.405
There's nothing in Greek mythology

04:14.429 --> 04:17.028
that says anything about
Perseus having 11 fingers.

04:17.098 --> 04:19.083
But I do know one place that does.

04:19.168 --> 04:21.363
Upstate New York. The Finger Lakes.

04:21.389 --> 04:22.656
There's 11 of them.

04:22.724 --> 04:24.644
All right, here's a map of the region.

04:24.719 --> 04:26.917
Can you scale that tattoo,
fit it to the map?

04:26.982 --> 04:29.049
All the tattoos are vectors.
I can do anything.

04:29.150 --> 04:32.195
So let's size this up, lose the sword,

04:32.260 --> 04:33.888
lose the Medusa head.

04:33.955 --> 04:35.982
Look, the fingers match the lakes.

04:36.865 --> 04:39.635
Perseus had two... rings on both hands

04:39.660 --> 04:41.055
with matching symbols.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.766
L-X-T and Y-1-7.

04:42.791 --> 04:45.093
Maybe we convert the letters
and get coordinates.

04:45.153 --> 04:47.221
No, but there still might be something

04:47.321 --> 04:49.219
if we connect the symbols.

04:52.114 --> 04:53.648
An intersection point.

04:53.673 --> 04:55.273
Pull up the satellite view on the map.

04:57.205 --> 04:58.901
Zoom in.

05:00.762 --> 05:02.463
What's there?

05:02.530 --> 05:05.165
It's nothing. A big, empty field.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.095
Wait, where is this tattoo on my body?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.455
Left breast. Chest!

05:09.738 --> 05:11.772
The left chest area.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.108
So what happens if you
take the new tattoo

05:14.175 --> 05:16.710
and overlay it with the old ink tattoos

05:16.778 --> 05:18.512
on my left chest area?

05:19.914 --> 05:21.565
What's at the intersection point?

05:21.638 --> 05:24.439
The new tattoos intersect
with the old tattoos.

05:24.464 --> 05:25.559
A circle.

05:25.584 --> 05:28.188
No... it's a search radius.

05:28.669 --> 05:30.222
But what are we searching for?

05:30.247 --> 05:32.135
What's L-X-T and Y-1-7?

05:32.173 --> 05:34.248
- We don't know.
- That's not the only problem.

05:34.273 --> 05:36.173
Things are different this time.
We know Roman tattooed you.

05:36.197 --> 05:37.531
We know he has ulterior motives.

05:37.599 --> 05:38.976
There's dangers to playing Roman's game.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.274
And there are dangers to not playing it.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.328
I'm not saying we don't.

05:41.353 --> 05:42.906
I'm just saying let's
be pragmatic about it.

05:42.930 --> 05:44.261
Cautious. Let's gather more intel.

05:44.285 --> 05:45.845
What if we don't have that kind of time?

05:45.869 --> 05:47.100
I don't see anything on these screens

05:47.124 --> 05:48.825
that says we need to rush
out of here right now.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.729
We can't just blindly
follow the tattoos again.

05:50.754 --> 05:52.627
I'm not gonna have this
office be manipulated.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.747
You saying like I did?

05:55.150 --> 05:56.551
That's not what I said.

05:56.576 --> 05:58.431
My whole body's a manipulation.

05:58.499 --> 05:59.666
We know the risks.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.702
We all joined this task
force to take 'em.

06:01.727 --> 06:03.732
How many times have we got
somewhere just in time?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.780
Or sometimes seconds too late?

06:05.805 --> 06:07.306
There could be lives at risk.

06:07.331 --> 06:08.820
We need to move now.

06:12.759 --> 06:14.319
It's a good thing we moved now.

06:14.361 --> 06:16.786
There's something out here.
We just gotta keep looking.

06:16.832 --> 06:19.332
We've been looking. All day.

06:19.357 --> 06:20.558
Let's not make it all night.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.383
I'll send a team to
finish up the grunt work.

06:22.407 --> 06:23.559
Where's the fun in that?

06:23.670 --> 06:24.904
I don't want to just quit.

06:24.972 --> 06:27.034
It's not quitting if it's an order.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.974
We're done here. Let's go.

06:32.312 --> 06:33.813
Hey...

06:33.985 --> 06:36.015
You're just mad 'cause you
got mud on your Guccis.

06:36.337 --> 06:39.085
I don't have time to chase
wild geese, Zapata.

06:39.152 --> 06:41.554
Relax, I'm joking.

06:41.622 --> 06:43.055
I have an office to run.

06:43.435 --> 06:45.491
Look, maybe we got the
search radius wrong.

06:45.559 --> 06:47.660
No. This is the right spot.

06:47.728 --> 06:49.735
- We just haven't seen it yet.
- Seen what?

06:49.760 --> 06:51.230
I mean, what makes you so sure

06:51.298 --> 06:53.265
that this is the right spot?

07:00.407 --> 07:01.707
Just a hunch.

07:05.460 --> 07:06.979
It's a satellite.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.712
Hey, look...

07:08.749 --> 07:10.850
L-X-T-Y-1-7.

07:11.184 --> 07:12.945
Same as the tattoo.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.933
It's definitely why we're here.

07:16.123 --> 07:17.623
Looks like someone else is, too.

07:22.496 --> 07:25.598
Fall back to the satellite!

07:30.063 --> 07:31.433
Over there!

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:40.430 --> 07:42.248
I can't get a shot
because of the lights!

07:42.315 --> 07:43.976
I got the 50 cal!

07:45.258 --> 07:46.792
Reade! Down!

07:47.682 --> 07:49.755
All right? We're not gonna win this.

07:49.823 --> 07:51.424
Let's just survive it. Okay?

07:51.491 --> 07:53.325
The hell are these guys?

07:54.795 --> 07:56.462
They're taking something.

08:00.382 --> 08:01.843
Okay, let's move!

08:09.476 --> 08:10.576
Patterson...

08:10.644 --> 08:11.944
send a recovery team.

08:12.012 --> 08:13.212
And a ride home.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.346
What did they take?

08:14.414 --> 08:15.448
I don't know.

08:15.515 --> 08:16.749
Let's find out.

08:21.849 --> 08:25.849
Synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

08:36.402 --> 08:39.035
Hey, Stuart, can you
hand me those pliers?

08:41.565 --> 08:43.248
- Stuart!
- Hmm?

08:43.328 --> 08:45.129
You wanna maybe forget
about your pet tattoo

08:45.154 --> 08:47.046
and focus on the satellite
that just fell out of the sky?

08:47.070 --> 08:48.342
Sorry, sorry, it's just...

08:48.367 --> 08:49.945
something about this one's just really

08:49.970 --> 08:51.718
rubbing me the wrong way, you know?

08:51.843 --> 08:53.468
I know the feeling.

08:53.797 --> 08:55.920
- So what do you got?
- Whatcha got?

08:56.422 --> 08:58.051
Could be anything at this point.

08:58.076 --> 09:00.207
Communications, GPS, financial.

09:00.232 --> 09:01.951
- Each of which...
- Could be foreign spies

09:01.976 --> 09:03.501
hiding a command- and-control server.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.695
Each of which... has its own set

09:05.724 --> 09:08.325
of unique and disastrous
consequences in the wrong hands.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.518
I'll know more after
the autopsy is done.

09:10.543 --> 09:11.719
To figure out what the satellite does,

09:11.743 --> 09:12.854
we need to figure out who owns it.

09:12.878 --> 09:14.422
We find out who owns it, we
ask them what it does...

09:14.446 --> 09:15.797
- They get it.
- Once we know that,

09:15.821 --> 09:17.133
we'll know what kind of tech was inside,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.539
we'll know what those mercenaries stole.

09:18.563 --> 09:20.683
Whatever it is, someone thinks
it's worth killing for.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.888
Hey, maybe we can bring in
Rich to lend an extra hand?

09:22.913 --> 09:24.657
Why, you think the satellite
fell out of the darkweb?

09:24.681 --> 09:26.549
No, he's just trying to offload his work

09:26.616 --> 09:29.051
on this case so he can follow
a hunch on another tattoo.

09:29.119 --> 09:31.056
We're not bringing in Rich.
We're not following hunches.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.360
We just followed Weller's hunch.

09:32.384 --> 09:33.705
It's not a democracy, Stuart.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.097
We're not voting on this.

09:35.122 --> 09:36.923
You and Patterson on the autopsy.

09:36.948 --> 09:39.308
Zapata, you and Jane run down
any leads on the mercenaries.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.034
Weller, can I talk to you for a second?

09:41.115 --> 09:42.311
Yes, sir.

09:44.201 --> 09:45.649
What's up?

09:45.674 --> 09:47.308
Have a seat.

09:50.493 --> 09:52.533
Just want to make sure we're
both on the same page.

09:52.557 --> 09:53.832
About the tattoo?

09:53.959 --> 09:55.692
- I was right about that.
- I know...

09:55.812 --> 09:58.309
it's a little crazy that's
the tattoo we solved today.

09:58.334 --> 10:00.113
Is there anything I need to know?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.108
I need a favor.

10:02.498 --> 10:04.334
Some help with the tattoos.

10:05.497 --> 10:06.864
Sometimes you get lucky.

10:06.889 --> 10:08.569
I don't know if I'd
call a satellite crash

10:08.624 --> 10:10.625
and an ambush "lucky."

10:11.016 --> 10:13.136
- We don't have a problem, right?
- What do you mean?

10:13.189 --> 10:14.909
I mean, we've all been
apart for two years,

10:14.933 --> 10:17.232
and I don't want to fall
back into any bad patterns.

10:22.011 --> 10:23.645
- Patterson's got something.
- Yep.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.970
I guess it's my turn, huh?

10:49.051 --> 10:50.627
Okay...

10:52.881 --> 10:55.550
I spent my life taking orders...

10:56.038 --> 10:57.952
but now I'm on my own.

10:59.442 --> 11:03.795
I've been trying to find a purpose...

11:03.987 --> 11:05.974
but it all seems so pointless.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.416
I'm starting to feel like
I can't do it anymore.

11:08.484 --> 11:11.799
Everyone I... was ever close to is gone.

11:11.899 --> 11:14.022
I'm... I'm tired of
being alone, you know?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.793
But I don't know how to be...

11:19.468 --> 11:22.120
Maybe I'm just tired of being myself.

11:29.027 --> 11:31.126
Gets easier.

11:31.193 --> 11:32.774
Just need to keep comin'.

11:32.842 --> 11:35.010
Actually, I think I'm
done with these things.

11:35.423 --> 11:37.091
There's too many people looking at me.

11:37.116 --> 11:38.480
Judging.

11:38.548 --> 11:40.916
Pity makes it worse. I
just want it to end.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.925
Yeah. That's the look.

11:45.086 --> 11:46.564
Nah, it's not pity, mate.

11:46.589 --> 11:48.810
You just said some stuff that...

11:49.725 --> 11:50.725
This coffee is rubbish.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.379
I know a joint around the corner.

11:52.499 --> 11:53.788
I'm not really up for, uh...

11:53.813 --> 11:56.364
loud noises and crowded spaces.

11:56.432 --> 11:58.266
All right. Twisted my arm.

11:58.334 --> 11:59.868
My place is over in The Rocks.

12:00.441 --> 12:01.823
What is this?

12:01.895 --> 12:03.575
It's me making sure you
don't do something

12:03.599 --> 12:04.887
rash or stupid.

12:05.194 --> 12:07.195
Now, I'm out of coffee, but I got beer.

12:07.276 --> 12:08.978
A little early for beer, isn't it?

12:09.125 --> 12:11.126
Not in Sydney, mate. Come on.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.766
- Whatcha got?
- Good news,

12:15.791 --> 12:17.235
Patterson was able to identify

12:17.260 --> 12:19.178
a proprietary piece of
tech in the satellite.

12:19.229 --> 12:20.878
This little cryocooler right here.

12:20.955 --> 12:23.448
The patent is held by a private
company called ProTechSat.

12:23.548 --> 12:25.594
Unfortunately, that's all I could find.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.930
The one-page website is
not super-illuminating.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.901
"ProTechSat, proprietary
technology for satellites."

12:33.199 --> 12:35.034
- Is there an address?
- Uh, it's in Midtown.

12:35.059 --> 12:36.492
All right, let's bring 'em in.

12:39.516 --> 12:41.098
Nikhil Thakker. ProTechSat.

12:41.123 --> 12:42.640
Marci Booth. Also ProTechSat.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.156
Assistant Director Reade.
This is Special Agent Weller.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.347
Thanks for coming in.

12:45.374 --> 12:46.694
Yeah, I'm still not entirely sure

12:46.719 --> 12:48.079
what we're doing here.

12:48.104 --> 12:49.894
Like I said, we found your satellite.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.319
You did say that, it's just that,

12:51.387 --> 12:52.808
you know, as I explained to you,

12:52.833 --> 12:55.490
in great detail, we're not missing one.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.393
Oh, this is for sure ours.

12:58.461 --> 13:00.033
I should make a call.

13:01.122 --> 13:02.589
What does the satellite do?

13:02.614 --> 13:04.654
Well, that's hard to say.
We have so many in orbit.

13:04.679 --> 13:06.479
I'd have to check the I.D.
code on the hatch.

13:06.534 --> 13:08.863
It's L-X-T-Y-1-7.

13:09.395 --> 13:11.006
Huh.

13:11.073 --> 13:12.774
Okay. Oh-kay. Okay.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.276
All right, we were hacked.

13:14.343 --> 13:16.423
Someone intentionally got
into our telemetric server

13:16.451 --> 13:17.491
and crashed the satellite.

13:17.519 --> 13:19.147
It's L-X-T-Y-1-7.

13:19.655 --> 13:20.888
I see.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.903
Any chance you managed
to recover the black box

13:23.928 --> 13:25.128
that was inside this hatch?

13:25.196 --> 13:26.830
No, it was stolen by an unidentified

13:26.855 --> 13:27.962
group of mercenaries.

13:27.987 --> 13:29.142
I should make another call.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.047
You should tell us what's
really going on here.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.431
Getting a little suspicious, guys.

13:32.456 --> 13:33.657
A lot of red flags.

13:33.681 --> 13:35.024
What does this satellite do?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.600
You don't have clearance for that.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.072
Without this team, you
wouldn't even know

13:38.096 --> 13:40.297
that satellite was missing,
and whatever was inside it

13:40.322 --> 13:42.522
is now in the hands of the
people who tried to kill us.

13:42.546 --> 13:43.999
So next call that you're gonna make

13:44.215 --> 13:46.350
is gonna get us that clearance.

13:46.495 --> 13:47.861
We're from the DOD.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.374
- Department of Defense.
- We know.

13:49.399 --> 13:50.660
Really? H-How did you...

13:50.685 --> 13:52.597
No, we know what DOD stands for.

13:52.710 --> 13:54.030
Keep explaining the rest.

13:54.055 --> 13:55.322
Right. Right, uh...

13:55.440 --> 13:57.243
ProTechSat is a front company we use

13:57.355 --> 13:59.590
to launch and manufacture
satellites that we're

13:59.615 --> 14:01.149
technically not supposed to have.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.275
Satellite L-X-T-Y-1-7

14:03.301 --> 14:05.054
was the main hub of our MDS.

14:05.079 --> 14:06.647
Missile Defense Shield.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.318
We don't have a missile defense shield.

14:08.342 --> 14:10.960
No! No, we <i>say</i> we don't have
a missile defense shield,

14:10.985 --> 14:12.042
but we do.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.567
The black box of that satellite

14:13.592 --> 14:14.687
talks to the black box

14:14.712 --> 14:16.747
of hundreds of other
satellites in our MSN.

14:16.942 --> 14:18.179
Missile Shield Network.

14:18.204 --> 14:20.814
If you have the black box and
a powerful enough computer

14:20.859 --> 14:23.127
and extremely high-level coding skills,

14:23.342 --> 14:25.910
you can connect remotely and
turn the whole shield off,

14:26.414 --> 14:29.780
leaving our country and our
allies vulnerable to ICBMs.

14:29.861 --> 14:31.953
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

14:31.978 --> 14:33.138
Is she gonna keep doing that?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.130
We'd never see the missiles coming.

14:35.239 --> 14:36.973
And we can't stop what we can't see.

14:37.028 --> 14:38.362
We'd be completely unprotected.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.755
Great, now I have to make a phone call.

14:41.019 --> 14:43.522
Ohh... I get it.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.189
ProTechSat.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.734
It protects it like it protects us.

14:47.786 --> 14:48.786
That's a good name.

14:48.811 --> 14:50.100
Thanks. I thought of it.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.814
All right, let's just take a step back.

14:51.856 --> 14:53.376
It's highly unlikely these mercenaries

14:53.401 --> 14:55.001
are in possession of ballistic missiles,

14:55.025 --> 14:57.417
so if you're them, what do
you do with the black box?

14:57.657 --> 14:59.363
Hold the missile shield hostage

14:59.404 --> 15:01.295
and ransom the box back to the DOD.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.020
Or sell it to the highest bidder.

15:03.094 --> 15:05.329
Okay... okay, I don't
want to be an alarmist,

15:05.370 --> 15:07.271
but I just got off the
phone with Keaton.

15:07.312 --> 15:09.713
The CIA has reliable
intel that North Korea's

15:09.754 --> 15:11.117
priming their nuclear missiles.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.550
It could be another test.

15:12.575 --> 15:13.935
It's a lot of missiles for a test.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.727
And so if we don't recover that box,

15:15.826 --> 15:18.533
there won't be a shield to protect us.

15:19.677 --> 15:21.165
- Is there a timeline?
- Imminent.

15:21.190 --> 15:22.856
North Korea's priming their
missiles as we speak.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.640
At best, it'll be an
international incident.

15:24.664 --> 15:25.766
At worst, nuclear war.

15:25.791 --> 15:26.791
And what's the target?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.560
CIA intel says California.

15:28.587 --> 15:29.867
But we don't know that for sure.

15:29.891 --> 15:31.062
Assuming it's California,

15:31.130 --> 15:33.097
this is our estimate for
impact and fallout.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.805
Now, keep in mind this is just

15:34.829 --> 15:37.969
one 20-kiliton ICBM with an airburst.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.571
They're mobilizing 13 to 21.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.925
That's millions dead.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.651
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

15:42.718 --> 15:44.382
North Korea is a formidable foe,

15:44.441 --> 15:46.604
however, the ICBMs that they've launched

15:46.629 --> 15:48.530
haven't come anywhere
close to American soil.

15:48.598 --> 15:50.238
That's because our
missile defense shield

15:50.262 --> 15:51.509
has stopped them, every time.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.135
Are you telling me the only thing

15:53.203 --> 15:56.171
between North Korea nukes and
us is a satellite shield

15:56.239 --> 15:58.238
that's about to go dark...
there's no backup?

15:58.263 --> 15:59.552
We're not even supposed
to have this one.

15:59.576 --> 16:01.466
It negates the whole
mutually-assured destruction idea

16:01.490 --> 16:03.004
that keeps everyone's nukes in check.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.109
But we designed the shield
with plenty of failsafes.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.652
I mean, as long as just one satellite

16:06.706 --> 16:08.217
in the network stays functional,

16:08.284 --> 16:09.919
we're totally protected.

16:09.993 --> 16:11.460
Uh-huh.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.481
I'm gonna loop in the White House.

16:14.691 --> 16:16.377
There's some good news.

16:16.557 --> 16:18.594
North Korea hasn't fired
a missile... yet.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.000
That's probably because they
don't have the black box yet.

16:21.024 --> 16:22.626
And if they're mobilizing warheads now,

16:22.651 --> 16:24.797
they're not gonna wait to
ship it across an ocean.

16:24.861 --> 16:26.692
They're gonna turn the
shields off from here.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.865
So that means we do have
some time to stop them.

16:28.965 --> 16:31.405
Good, keep digging into the
hacker who dropped the satellite.

16:31.429 --> 16:33.375
Now, what do we have on...

16:33.443 --> 16:35.862
Never mind, Stuart's got
something on the mercenaries.

16:35.887 --> 16:37.024
Really?

16:37.062 --> 16:38.832
Okay, so, no luck tracking the mercs

16:38.857 --> 16:40.821
in or out the satellite crash site.

16:40.942 --> 16:42.743
But two hunters were reported missing

16:42.810 --> 16:44.845
in the same area, and local P.D. found

16:44.913 --> 16:47.257
some interesting footage
on a hidden trail cam.

16:47.357 --> 16:49.816
And by interesting, I mean horrific.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.518
The cam's used to track black bears,

16:51.586 --> 16:53.820
but it caught this instead.

16:57.385 --> 16:59.345
I'll stop it there. What
comes next isn't pretty.

16:59.369 --> 17:02.496
But we now have video
of this guy's ugly mug.

17:02.868 --> 17:04.998
We're running facial right now.
If we can I.D. him...

17:05.066 --> 17:06.400
His name's Dwire Lee.

17:06.749 --> 17:08.167
You know him?

17:08.464 --> 17:10.503
- How?
- We did some K&R together.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.065
Kidnap and Ransom? When?

17:12.140 --> 17:13.373
When I was on the run.

17:13.441 --> 17:15.675
Dwire and I crossed paths on a few jobs.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.176
Sometimes he was Dwire Lee,

17:17.244 --> 17:19.213
sometimes Paul Kay,
sometimes Adam Stone.

17:19.391 --> 17:20.980
I'm sure he has other aliases,

17:21.005 --> 17:22.458
but those are the ones
that I know for sure.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.294
If you were operating
outside of the law,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.262
that could mean major ramifications
for this task force.

17:26.287 --> 17:28.021
She was helping rescue
kidnapping victims.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.756
It's not like she was running drugs

17:29.824 --> 17:32.392
or assassinating politicians.

17:32.502 --> 17:34.649
- Or were you?
- No! Of course not.

17:34.728 --> 17:37.696
Jane's past just gave us a major lead.

17:38.105 --> 17:40.006
Run the aliases.

17:42.243 --> 17:43.943
Kurt, I can explain.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.691
I need a minute.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.585
What, you're not having another one?

17:50.811 --> 17:52.244
Just pacing myself, mate.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.103
Ha! Come on.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.049
Australian Defense Force?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.284
2nd Commando Regiment.

17:57.352 --> 17:59.686
Ah, I was wondering what brought you

17:59.754 --> 18:01.321
to the PTSD support group.

18:01.533 --> 18:04.524
Helmand Province was a
special kind of hell.

18:04.592 --> 18:06.360
That's my best mate Mike.

18:06.973 --> 18:08.895
We were lucky enough to make it home.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.316
I was cocky enough to think I
had a handle on my trauma,

18:11.341 --> 18:12.766
and then Mike jumped off a bridge.

18:13.014 --> 18:14.347
Gutted me.

18:14.383 --> 18:16.743
'Cause it seemed like Mike had
a handle on his trauma, too,

18:16.787 --> 18:19.619
and that's when I realized
I needed more help.

18:19.955 --> 18:21.675
What about you?

18:21.743 --> 18:23.176
Military?

18:23.244 --> 18:24.835
Not officially.

18:24.939 --> 18:26.206
Um...

18:27.715 --> 18:30.035
I saw combat, but...

18:31.185 --> 18:32.753
I never had a best friend.

18:34.022 --> 18:35.756
Or any friends, really.

18:35.969 --> 18:37.648
Just my sister.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.128
Our parents were murdered, and, uh...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.023
well, we grew up in an orphanage

18:43.048 --> 18:45.250
in South Africa during apartheid.

18:45.317 --> 18:47.285
Doesn't sound like a good place, mate.

18:47.353 --> 18:51.291
Well, then we were adopted by...
a monster.

18:51.389 --> 18:54.358
All we ever had was each other.

18:54.420 --> 18:55.757
Until she left.

18:55.897 --> 18:57.543
Yeah.

18:58.016 --> 19:00.451
Yeah, escape is a selfish act.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.001
Just leaves a mess for the
ones who love you most.

19:03.068 --> 19:05.195
You got every right to
feel angry, brother.

19:06.097 --> 19:07.647
Half the time, I want my sister back.

19:07.672 --> 19:09.801
Half the time, I wanna kill her.

19:13.913 --> 19:15.079
Sorry, I, uh...

19:15.147 --> 19:17.248
No, no, no. You gotta get it out.

19:17.316 --> 19:19.136
But your next beer's gonna be a water.

19:29.926 --> 19:32.493
I'm sorry you had to find out that way.

19:32.666 --> 19:34.472
I wanted to tell you about the K&R,

19:34.552 --> 19:37.237
but I just... things are still
getting back to normal.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.164
I get it.

19:39.290 --> 19:40.640
You were on the run.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.576
- You did what you had to do.
- No... I didn't have to.

19:43.644 --> 19:45.487
I chose to.

19:45.634 --> 19:47.101
I liked it.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.055
I have all these skills,

19:49.117 --> 19:51.371
and it felt good to put 'em
to use to save people.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.075
And to not be held accountable
for the lives that you ended.

19:54.102 --> 19:56.022
Or for the lives that you
didn't manage to save.

19:56.046 --> 19:57.345
You can't... no.

19:57.412 --> 19:59.843
You have no idea what I did
or didn't do while I was...

19:59.868 --> 20:02.916
Exactly, Jane! I have no idea.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.221
It's Patterson.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.800
One of the aliases popped.

20:08.824 --> 20:10.791
Adam Stone, a.k.a. Dwire Lee,

20:10.859 --> 20:12.569
landed at JFK a few weeks ago.

20:12.594 --> 20:14.595
After that, disappeared.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.965
No hotel, no rental
car, nothing to track.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.367
If he's in town on a job,

20:19.434 --> 20:20.935
someone else is footing the bill.

20:21.182 --> 20:22.664
Can you track the company
that bought his airfare

20:22.688 --> 20:24.248
to see if they're paying
for his safe house, too?

20:24.272 --> 20:25.583
Already on it... I've
been looking at a web

20:25.607 --> 20:27.308
of suspected North
Korean shell companies,

20:27.376 --> 20:29.477
cross-referencing them
with major purchases

20:29.544 --> 20:30.845
across the country.

20:30.912 --> 20:32.507
Flights, Super Duty trucks,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.949
computer equipment, real estate...
nothing stood out.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.918
A 50-caliber gatling gun.

20:38.386 --> 20:40.955
Nothing stood out until
the alias Jane provided

20:41.028 --> 20:43.397
gave us Dwire's flight number and...

20:43.458 --> 20:44.859
a new shell company.

20:44.926 --> 20:46.806
Add it to the web, narrow
the search parameters

20:46.831 --> 20:48.711
to the timeline of Dwire's
arrival in New York,

20:48.735 --> 20:49.726
and we get...

20:49.751 --> 20:52.747
Three short-term leases
registered to the same company.

20:52.841 --> 20:55.009
A warehouse in Queens, a
townhouse in Brooklyn,

20:55.076 --> 20:57.478
and a parking lot in the Bronx.

20:57.545 --> 20:58.738
He's in Brooklyn.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.648
- Are you sure?
- That's where I'd be.

21:00.715 --> 21:01.941
Look at the other ones.

21:02.015 --> 21:03.590
Parking lot's too exposed,

21:03.615 --> 21:05.182
warehouse doesn't have enough outs.

21:05.257 --> 21:06.791
Yeah, she's right.

21:06.858 --> 21:08.928
That townhouse has quick
access to the water,

21:08.988 --> 21:10.604
the freeways, the subway system.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.063
Plus, the last time I saw Dwire,

21:12.130 --> 21:14.135
he wouldn't shut up about Luger Burgers.

21:14.235 --> 21:16.901
Peter Luger's like a block away.
They only take cash.

21:16.968 --> 21:18.495
He's gotta be there.

21:20.658 --> 21:22.073
What time you got, huh?

21:22.140 --> 21:24.950
'Cause I got about half
past amateur hour.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.117
They were supposed to be here at...

21:28.547 --> 21:30.815
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

21:30.882 --> 21:32.039
Get down!

21:32.064 --> 21:33.344
- Get on the floor!
- Spread 'em!

21:33.368 --> 21:34.485
Hello, Dwire.

21:34.553 --> 21:35.993
Remember me?

21:36.017 --> 21:37.221
This is for Paris.

21:37.289 --> 21:38.656
Get 'em out of here.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.869
We've got the black box.

21:57.870 --> 21:59.662
Hey... do you have a minute?

21:59.737 --> 22:01.777
Depends. Has North Korea
stood down their missiles?

22:01.801 --> 22:03.521
Not yet. Then I have a
few seconds at best.

22:03.545 --> 22:04.773
- Walk with me.
- Okay.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.909
Is it just me, or is there something up

22:06.934 --> 22:08.621
- with Assistant Director Reade?
- Like how?

22:08.645 --> 22:09.880
Like how he hasn't said a word to me

22:09.904 --> 22:11.544
or anyone else that
isn't a direct order.

22:11.579 --> 22:12.739
I... I would cut him a break.

22:12.763 --> 22:14.174
When I was creating my app...

22:14.242 --> 22:16.109
Wonderville. Wizardville.

22:16.177 --> 22:17.678
I hired a lot of my friends,

22:17.745 --> 22:19.947
and telling them what to do all the time

22:20.014 --> 22:21.540
wasn't a ton of fun.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.991
It's not like I'm
trying to be extra fun.

22:24.016 --> 22:25.550
I'm just trying to be normal.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.760
Okay, well, maybe you need
to find your new normal.

22:27.784 --> 22:28.855
Look at me and Stuart.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.640
We hate each other, and
we're still friends.

22:30.665 --> 22:32.145
Yeah, I don't think Stuart hates you.

22:32.169 --> 22:33.362
No, he definitely does.

22:33.548 --> 22:35.682
This... it's like our whole thing.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.144
Um, I don't think he knows that.

22:38.253 --> 22:40.954
Oh... now I feel bad.

22:41.202 --> 22:43.507
Okay, I need to... be better.

22:43.844 --> 22:45.373
I'll fix it.

22:46.507 --> 22:47.808
How we doing, Nikhil?

22:47.875 --> 22:49.875
Fingers crossed the missile
shield's still active.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.742
But we don't know if the
black box was cloned.

22:51.766 --> 22:54.042
Marci's running diagnostics on it now.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.934
How long until we know if the
data's been copied or compromised?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.885
Hard to say. The system's
running really slow.

22:58.953 --> 23:00.449
Just a ton of lag.

23:02.777 --> 23:05.108
Stuart! Are you kidding?

23:05.295 --> 23:07.480
Please tell me you're
not using up bandwidth

23:07.551 --> 23:09.671
on that molecule tattoo.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.007
I just thought, since the
threat's been neutralized...

23:12.031 --> 23:13.990
The threat has not been neutralized!

23:14.030 --> 23:15.430
The nukes are still live.

23:15.455 --> 23:17.823
The North Koreans are
nothing if not persistent.

23:18.074 --> 23:20.316
I need my team scanning the DOD firewall

23:20.377 --> 23:22.445
to find the hacker who
crashed the satellite

23:22.513 --> 23:24.313
so he doesn't drop another
one and try again.

23:24.337 --> 23:25.628
- Or she.
- Exactly.

23:25.736 --> 23:27.416
Women can be hackers, too, Stuart.

23:27.441 --> 23:29.550
I never said they... I
never said they couldn't.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.180
This is a very high-octane situation!

23:31.205 --> 23:32.365
Are you on this team or not?!

23:32.509 --> 23:33.726
Honestly, you scare me,

23:33.751 --> 23:35.031
and I'm just trying to be useful

23:35.055 --> 23:36.601
while I stay out of your way.

23:36.626 --> 23:38.170
Okay, Dwire's in Interrogation One,

23:38.195 --> 23:39.995
but we're still missing
pieces to the puzzle.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.076
Where are we on finding the hacker?

23:41.100 --> 23:42.558
It's a signal, a noise issue,

23:42.583 --> 23:44.048
all kinds of attempted hacks,

23:44.073 --> 23:46.280
disguising the one that
actually got through.

23:46.305 --> 23:47.472
But we're working on it.

23:47.497 --> 23:49.137
I designed the satellite
security system.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.575
I might be able to decipher
any potential breaches.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.838
I could use all the help we could get.

23:52.862 --> 23:53.895
All right, jump in.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.120
Zapata, you stay with Marci.

23:55.145 --> 23:56.690
As soon as she secures the black box,

23:56.715 --> 23:58.361
make sure she gets an
FBI escort back to DOD.

23:58.385 --> 23:59.641
Great, if I'm not too worn out

23:59.666 --> 24:00.883
from arranging transportation,

24:00.908 --> 24:02.234
then maybe I'll run down
some more CIA leads.

24:02.258 --> 24:03.493
Good thinking. Do it.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.800
Weller, Jane, you guys are with me.

24:04.824 --> 24:05.846
I'll take the lead on Dwire.

24:05.870 --> 24:07.750
If there's North Korean
operatives in the area,

24:07.774 --> 24:09.375
he's gonna be the key to finding them.

24:09.446 --> 24:10.753
Full immunity.

24:10.894 --> 24:12.261
That's never gonna happen.

24:12.329 --> 24:13.769
Did you hack the satellite yourself?

24:13.793 --> 24:15.283
Ha! Do I look like a nerd?

24:15.308 --> 24:17.788
You look like a guy who's gonna
spend a lot of time in prison.

24:17.812 --> 24:19.830
Maybe. Or maybe I'll break out.

24:19.969 --> 24:22.291
I got a bunch of cash stashed away,

24:22.404 --> 24:25.350
a ton of aliases our little
friend don't know nothin' about.

24:25.421 --> 24:27.189
Is she watching right now?

24:27.530 --> 24:28.909
<i>Hey, Jane.</i>

24:28.959 --> 24:30.635
Tell me who crashed the satellite.

24:30.660 --> 24:31.994
I told you, man.

24:32.162 --> 24:34.396
I was in the woods, minding my business,

24:34.424 --> 24:36.104
getting ready to play
a little paint ball,

24:36.128 --> 24:37.966
when a couple of very scary men

24:38.034 --> 24:40.168
killed two very rude hunters.

24:40.274 --> 24:42.714
Now, if y'all hadn't have got
to that townhouse when you did,

24:42.738 --> 24:45.425
they even might have... killed me, too.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.277
That townhouse was paid for by
a North Korean shell company.

24:48.345 --> 24:51.347
The same one that paid for your airfare.

24:51.414 --> 24:54.446
Is that the good Korea or the bad one?

24:54.586 --> 24:57.286
It's the one pointing nuclear
missiles at us right now.

24:57.354 --> 24:59.188
Are they operating stateside?

24:59.255 --> 25:01.990
Can you confirm
California's their target?

25:02.370 --> 25:05.973
I can confirm I sure as hell
hope it's not New York.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.269
You know Jane from K&R. Right?

25:14.337 --> 25:15.838
You saved lives together.

25:16.504 --> 25:18.544
You have a chance to save
a lot of lives right now,

25:18.568 --> 25:20.488
and you don't care, you're
just gonna sit there,

25:20.512 --> 25:22.300
pledging allegiance to North Korea?

25:22.414 --> 25:24.413
See, that's where you're wrong, man.

25:24.672 --> 25:28.007
My loyalty's to Bitcoin
and immunity deals.

25:29.365 --> 25:31.774
Make me an offer... hmm?

25:33.723 --> 25:35.563
So that's the guy that
you chose to work with?

25:35.753 --> 25:38.027
No. I worked with good people, too.

25:38.074 --> 25:39.975
Guys like Dwire are an
occupational hazard.

25:40.043 --> 25:41.883
Yeah, well, maybe the
occupation's the hazard.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.926
I couldn't control who
else got hired for a job,

25:43.951 --> 25:46.319
but the ends justified the means.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.312
Haven't you ever worked with bad people

25:48.337 --> 25:49.804
to do good things?

25:53.256 --> 25:56.625
Yeah... we work with
Rich all the time now.

25:56.693 --> 25:57.860
You're friend's a prick.

25:57.928 --> 25:59.228
He's not my friend.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.496
He's a megalomaniac

26:00.564 --> 26:02.562
who thinks he can win
any game he's playing.

26:02.587 --> 26:03.799
It is possible that he didn't even know

26:03.823 --> 26:05.323
that he was working for North Korea.

26:05.369 --> 26:06.614
Or he doesn't want to roll over on them

26:06.638 --> 26:07.805
without an immunity deal.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.121
You're gonna give him a deal?

26:09.146 --> 26:10.215
If that's what it takes.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.907
It's your office, it's your call.

26:11.975 --> 26:13.637
If you think immunity is best...

26:13.662 --> 26:16.423
I think ballistic missiles are in
play and we're running out of time.

26:16.457 --> 26:18.500
Nothing else I'm doing today is working.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.479
- You want my take?
- Sure.

26:20.984 --> 26:23.687
Your old team is back, and
you're overcompensating.

26:23.727 --> 26:26.061
Taking on too much,
second-guessing yourself,

26:26.096 --> 26:28.397
and from the field report I read...

26:28.625 --> 26:29.992
almost getting yourself killed.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.627
Please, don't sugarcoat it.

26:31.695 --> 26:34.163
Be the leader I have seen you be.

26:34.497 --> 26:36.330
Your team is the best of the best.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.980
Hell, that's why we formed
this task force, isn't it?

26:39.384 --> 26:41.724
Empower them, trust them...

26:41.871 --> 26:43.872
and they'll deliver.

26:46.744 --> 26:48.844
Ohh, there she is!

26:50.040 --> 26:52.238
Jane, you sold out, girl.

26:52.332 --> 26:53.682
Or were you always a G-man?

26:54.038 --> 26:56.624
You wasting your talents here.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.549
I liked you a lot better
when you were unaffiliated.

26:59.588 --> 27:01.267
- Hmm, funny...
- Mm.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.891
I never liked you.

27:03.226 --> 27:05.194
But I used to respect your skill set.

27:05.494 --> 27:07.263
Which is clearly fading
with your hairline.

27:07.330 --> 27:09.098
Ooh.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.565
I should have killed you for
that bounty when I had a chance.

27:11.732 --> 27:13.636
You lucky Clem waved me off.

27:13.703 --> 27:15.003
Does Clem know you FBI?

27:15.028 --> 27:16.369
Do you ever shut up?

27:16.573 --> 27:18.073
You know the reason you got caught

27:18.141 --> 27:20.542
was because you wouldn't
stop yapping about burgers.

27:20.781 --> 27:22.578
Right? For a guy whose motto is,

27:22.646 --> 27:25.347
"Get in, get out, get
paid," what happened?

27:25.415 --> 27:27.375
- Hey, I didn't screw up!
- You forget to get out?

27:27.399 --> 27:29.187
Really? As far as I can tell,

27:29.212 --> 27:31.292
you were sitting on $1 billion
worth of stolen tech,

27:31.316 --> 27:32.521
just waiting to get busted.

27:32.589 --> 27:34.781
Mm, no, no. I followed the plan.

27:34.841 --> 27:36.892
If... if my employees would
have shown up on time,

27:36.960 --> 27:38.245
I'd have been home free.

27:38.270 --> 27:41.138
Your employers hung you out to dry.

27:41.598 --> 27:43.332
Mm-mmm... maybe they didn't show up

27:43.357 --> 27:45.376
'cause they knew the
FBI was coming, huh?

27:45.488 --> 27:47.756
Maybe I'm not the problem.

27:48.090 --> 27:50.223
Maybe your new team sprung a leak.

27:53.622 --> 27:55.342
If he's right, we could
be in real trouble.

27:55.378 --> 27:57.546
Zapata's been talking
to her CIA connections,

27:57.574 --> 27:59.054
Hirst made phone calls up the ladder.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.558
The lead could have come from anyone.

28:00.582 --> 28:01.558
Not quite.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.703
Those sources only have one
piece of the puzzle each.

28:03.727 --> 28:06.105
Some new about the satellite
and some knew about the raid.

28:06.178 --> 28:07.730
Okay, so who knew about both?

28:09.977 --> 28:11.427
I didn't do anything.

28:11.494 --> 28:13.362
You have the clearance, the access.

28:13.430 --> 28:14.509
As of yesterday,

28:14.563 --> 28:16.369
you had $2 million in Bitcoin

28:16.412 --> 28:17.808
and a one-way ticket to Dubai.

28:17.855 --> 28:19.768
You think I did this for $2 million

28:19.861 --> 28:23.029
to crash a satellite and help
North Korea nuke California?

28:23.106 --> 28:25.541
I went to UC Berkeley!

28:25.775 --> 28:26.842
I need a lawyer.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.230
There's not a lawyer in the world

28:28.258 --> 28:29.818
that could get you out of this, Nikhil.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.374
Last night,

28:31.399 --> 28:33.500
you used your own security badge

28:33.525 --> 28:35.059
to access the satellite network.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.440
From your own terminal!

28:36.465 --> 28:39.034
I was in the hospital last night.

28:39.481 --> 28:40.882
Call the hospital!

28:40.940 --> 28:42.291
I... I was there all night.

28:42.359 --> 28:43.625
Call Marci.

28:43.653 --> 28:45.053
I... I asked her to let my dogs out

28:45.077 --> 28:47.603
because I wouldn't be home and...

28:47.796 --> 28:49.430
Where was your access badge?

28:49.604 --> 28:51.867
Did you have it on you?

28:51.935 --> 28:53.361
No...

28:53.603 --> 28:56.372
No, it was in my apartment.

28:56.512 --> 28:58.052
And so was Marci.

29:17.873 --> 29:20.208
Sale's back on. Meet me in 20 minutes.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.584
I'll text you the location.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.977
I'm crying, and... and Bill,

29:26.024 --> 29:27.544
he just keeps stealing my soup, right?

29:27.569 --> 29:28.689
And he won't leave me alone.

29:28.713 --> 29:30.311
And I see my dad, and he's running,

29:30.649 --> 29:33.009
and he just lines up Billy and
he kicks him over the fence.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.920
Wait, wait, wait, your dad
kicked a kid over the fence?

29:35.988 --> 29:37.188
- A kid?
- Yeah.

29:37.256 --> 29:39.410
No, no. Billy was my cat.

29:39.477 --> 29:40.757
Did I not say that bit?

29:45.043 --> 29:47.144
Ohh. Ohh.

29:47.623 --> 29:49.734
Billy was your cat. Okay.

29:54.913 --> 29:57.415
Well... thank you for the beer,

29:57.501 --> 29:59.903
and the... company.

30:00.079 --> 30:01.345
I... I haven't, um...

30:01.413 --> 30:02.847
Hey, mate, no problem.

30:02.915 --> 30:04.282
Happy to.

30:05.717 --> 30:07.051
But I gotta ask.

30:07.131 --> 30:08.706
All that stuff you said earlier,

30:08.813 --> 30:12.090
feeling alone, everything
seeming so pointless...

30:12.136 --> 30:14.604
I've heard it before.

30:14.693 --> 30:17.286
I was too afraid to
ask Mike this, but...

30:17.756 --> 30:19.276
you're not gonna hurt yourself, right?

30:19.319 --> 30:21.978
No. I'm not gonna hurt myself.

30:25.069 --> 30:26.284
Good.

30:27.698 --> 30:31.008
'Cause I don't think I could go
through that again, you know?

30:31.224 --> 30:33.811
Not for all the money in the world.

30:34.985 --> 30:36.286
Money?

30:36.340 --> 30:38.942
Yeah. My mate Mike was loaded.

30:39.362 --> 30:41.752
Left me everything. Millions.

30:42.119 --> 30:46.022
Just wanna get rid of it.
Use it for something good.

30:47.092 --> 30:50.027
I don't think I've ever
told anyone that before.

30:50.462 --> 30:52.063
Been nursing these beers all day.

30:52.131 --> 30:53.851
My tolerance must be low.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.768
It's not your tolerance, it's the drugs.

31:00.097 --> 31:01.472
I spiked your drink with a blend

31:01.540 --> 31:04.275
of sodium thiopental and hemlock.

31:04.343 --> 31:06.644
Truth serum with a nasty kick.

31:07.071 --> 31:08.520
I've been targeting you, Tom.

31:08.571 --> 31:11.849
You come to the same PTSD
support group every week.

31:12.112 --> 31:14.585
"Pity makes it worse, I
just want it to end"?

31:14.653 --> 31:16.254
That's exactly what Mike emailed you

31:16.319 --> 31:17.924
before he jumped off the bridge.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.423
I knew I could trigger you.

31:19.638 --> 31:21.938
Make you wanna... protect me.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.565
Over the last few hours, you've told me

31:23.589 --> 31:25.017
your mother's maiden name,

31:25.170 --> 31:27.031
the city you met your best friend in,

31:27.099 --> 31:30.101
the street you grew up on...

31:30.602 --> 31:32.128
your first pet's name.

31:32.215 --> 31:34.705
Everything I need to get into
your bank account undetected.

31:34.773 --> 31:37.041
- Please...
- Don't beg.

31:37.109 --> 31:38.835
Don't try to move.

31:40.345 --> 31:42.246
This is hard enough.

31:42.641 --> 31:45.341
See, I've killed a lot of people, Tom.

31:46.332 --> 31:48.319
But I've never actually
liked any of them.

31:48.952 --> 31:50.688
It felt good to talk.

31:50.756 --> 31:52.990
Like a real friend.

31:53.058 --> 31:54.600
I don't wanna die.

31:54.726 --> 31:56.614
I know.

31:57.745 --> 31:59.857
I promise it won't hurt.

32:01.004 --> 32:03.539
And I promise I will do
something good with the money.

32:03.847 --> 32:05.681
Why are you doing this?

32:07.658 --> 32:09.097
For the money?

32:10.286 --> 32:12.043
Tom...

32:12.285 --> 32:15.121
if all I wanted was your money,

32:15.312 --> 32:16.840
I'd just take it.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.734
I'm here for something else.

32:28.419 --> 32:30.364
You need to think harder, Nikhil.

32:30.484 --> 32:32.524
Marci has the black box.
We're running out of time.

32:32.548 --> 32:33.604
I don't know anything!

32:33.629 --> 32:35.330
Yes, you do.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.282
Marci the hacker, Marci the terrorist.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.739
She's the same woman
you've been working with.

32:41.853 --> 32:43.333
Just because she was hiding something

32:43.357 --> 32:44.637
doesn't mean you don't know her.

32:44.781 --> 32:46.582
<i>It means that you can use what you know</i>

32:46.643 --> 32:48.210
<i>to figure out the rest.</i>

32:48.450 --> 32:49.950
Where did she go?

32:52.441 --> 32:53.708
Marci's smart.

32:53.733 --> 32:55.868
She'd stick to public places.

32:56.205 --> 32:57.773
Okay.

32:57.988 --> 33:01.009
She needs to make a remote
connection to the shield.

33:01.073 --> 33:02.957
She'd need speed to cover her tracks.

33:03.019 --> 33:05.696
Something that's already transferring...

33:05.762 --> 33:07.396
epic amounts of data.

33:07.464 --> 33:09.466
Good. Good, okay.

33:09.525 --> 33:12.019
This is where we found
the FBI escort vehicle.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.336
<i>That's right near River Point Museum.</i>

33:14.404 --> 33:16.066
<i>And Marci's on the advisory board.</i>

33:16.091 --> 33:17.358
It's super public.

33:17.407 --> 33:19.875
Its research department
transfers massive

33:19.900 --> 33:21.701
amounts of data per day.

33:29.398 --> 33:30.868
I love you, Kurt.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.460
I love you, too.

33:33.562 --> 33:34.834
You're angry.

33:34.859 --> 33:36.626
Not at you.

33:36.793 --> 33:39.115
There's no way running into
Dwire was a coincidence.

33:39.174 --> 33:40.909
Roman made that happen.

33:41.090 --> 33:42.131
Penance.

33:42.198 --> 33:45.388
These tattoos are how
you'll pay your way.

33:45.454 --> 33:47.855
He designed these tattoos to punish me.

33:47.962 --> 33:51.398
He wants us to lie.
He wants us to fight.

33:51.431 --> 33:53.095
I mean, he wants to control us.

33:53.195 --> 33:54.977
The only way to figure out his end game

33:55.045 --> 33:58.681
is to survive whatever
landmines he puts in our path.

33:58.748 --> 34:01.383
We can't let Roman drive us apart.

34:04.788 --> 34:06.822
All right, give me teams in every exit.

34:06.890 --> 34:09.257
Weller, you and Jane
take the main floor.

34:09.456 --> 34:11.882
- Yes, sir.
- Zapata and I will head upstairs.

34:14.413 --> 34:16.532
Patterson, send I.D. photos of Marci

34:16.599 --> 34:18.033
- <i>to everyone's phone.</i>
- Done!

34:18.101 --> 34:20.330
I'm looking at blueprints of the museum.

34:20.437 --> 34:22.239
<i>Marci needs a high-powered
computing station</i>

34:22.338 --> 34:23.605
<i>to turn off the shield.</i>

34:23.672 --> 34:25.103
<i>There's one in the planetarium.</i>

34:25.129 --> 34:26.196
We're heading in now.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.855
<i>Reade, Tasha,</i>

34:27.880 --> 34:29.960
<i>keep searching upstairs in
case Marci's on the move.</i>

34:30.024 --> 34:31.864
<i>Asteroids from the main belt</i>

34:31.888 --> 34:34.665
<i>crash together, sending debris careening</i>

34:34.690 --> 34:36.290
<i>out into the solar system,</i>

34:36.386 --> 34:39.655
<i>and gravity from celestial
bodies like the earth</i>

34:39.723 --> 34:42.958
<i>pull the meteoroids onto
a collision course.</i>

34:43.242 --> 34:46.495
<i>But when a rogue asteroid
doesn't strike...</i>

34:46.563 --> 34:47.815
Marci.

34:48.016 --> 34:49.288
Marci.

34:53.670 --> 34:54.937
She's dead.

34:55.004 --> 34:56.322
She's dead.

34:56.743 --> 34:58.031
The black box is gone.

34:58.104 --> 35:00.544
<i>Uh, okay, well, there's
some more bad news.</i>

35:00.569 --> 35:02.930
The black box just connected
to the satellite network.

35:02.955 --> 35:05.590
Someone is writing code to turn
off the missile shield right now.

35:05.711 --> 35:07.612
We gotta get these people out of here.

35:09.282 --> 35:11.216
Everyone, get down! Down on the floor!

35:11.284 --> 35:12.450
Now! Stay down!

35:17.843 --> 35:19.344
Get down! Everybody down!

35:19.411 --> 35:20.832
Everybody down!

35:22.347 --> 35:24.027
Okay, it looks like
there's a computer hub

35:24.051 --> 35:25.312
in the planetarium itself.

35:25.370 --> 35:27.130
The North Koreans must
have their own coder.

35:27.154 --> 35:29.015
He or she is shutting
down the missile shield

35:29.040 --> 35:30.007
at an incredible rate.

35:30.032 --> 35:32.967
All the satellites in the
shield are going offline.

35:33.295 --> 35:34.862
98...

35:35.139 --> 35:37.491
<i>71... you need to stop that coder before</i>

35:37.533 --> 35:39.173
all the satellites in
the shield go dark.

35:39.197 --> 35:40.508
<i>58. 31.</i>

35:40.576 --> 35:42.372
<i>You are very quickly
running out of time.</i>

35:42.418 --> 35:43.845
Yeah, we get it!

35:43.913 --> 35:46.752
We just can't make it to the
computer room. Can't you hack them?

35:46.833 --> 35:48.553
If I could hack them
in time, I wouldn't be

35:48.577 --> 35:50.093
yelling at you to hurry up... 26!

35:50.215 --> 35:51.696
I don't have a shot.

35:52.265 --> 35:53.732
<i>19.</i>

35:53.967 --> 35:55.534
Weller, go! I got you covered!

35:55.629 --> 35:58.364
<i>12... 12 satellites left.</i>

35:58.711 --> 36:00.879
You need to move, now!

36:09.686 --> 36:11.056
Uhh!

36:18.665 --> 36:19.932
Agh! Ah!

36:20.000 --> 36:21.267
<i>Three satellites left!</i>

36:21.292 --> 36:22.426
Uhh!

36:22.451 --> 36:23.604
<i>Two satellites left!</i>

36:23.629 --> 36:24.910
<i>Those missiles are gonna fire!</i>

36:24.935 --> 36:25.935
Uhh!

36:29.278 --> 36:30.278
You okay?

36:30.303 --> 36:31.470
<i>Two left!</i>

36:31.924 --> 36:33.679
Two... satellites left.

36:33.737 --> 36:35.265
You did it. Yay.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.485
That was... not fun.

36:37.453 --> 36:39.146
- Clear!
- Clear!

36:39.171 --> 36:41.142
My comms went out! We get nuked?

36:41.167 --> 36:42.935
No! No.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.496
All the satellites are back up.

36:50.521 --> 36:51.855
Missile shields online.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.781
North Korea stood down their missiles.

36:53.833 --> 36:55.934
They're not acknowledging the attack.

36:55.959 --> 36:58.384
- What attack?
- Exactly.

36:58.605 --> 37:00.306
Nice work, everybody.

37:00.373 --> 37:01.907
Saved a lot of lives today.

37:01.966 --> 37:03.286
Yeah, I just wanna thank you all.

37:03.310 --> 37:04.550
Aw, you don't need to thank us.

37:04.574 --> 37:05.844
No, I do.

37:05.872 --> 37:07.792
This job is hard, and it's
just getting started.

37:07.816 --> 37:09.081
And if today is any indication,

37:09.149 --> 37:10.482
we're in for a few surprises.

37:10.683 --> 37:12.417
There'll be some kinks to work out,

37:12.629 --> 37:14.910
gonna take some time for us
to get used to our new roles,

37:14.934 --> 37:16.997
but... we're a damn good team.

37:17.049 --> 37:18.182
I will drink to that.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.957
No, you won't, no more
drinking in the lab.

37:19.982 --> 37:21.542
That's a new rule, but aside from that,

37:21.566 --> 37:22.609
not much is different.

37:22.634 --> 37:25.569
We follow the tattoos
and we take Roman down.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.880
Whatever his true motives may be.

37:35.608 --> 37:37.176
Hello.

37:38.878 --> 37:40.377
I'm Tom Jakeman.

37:40.402 --> 37:43.571
Hello. Hello.

37:43.750 --> 37:45.517
Tom Jakeman.

37:45.585 --> 37:46.986
I have all this money.

37:47.053 --> 37:49.588
Couldn't go through that again.

37:49.656 --> 37:50.900
Not for all...

37:50.925 --> 37:54.494
Not "fohr" all the money in the world.

37:59.132 --> 38:01.299
Why are you doing this?

38:01.480 --> 38:05.170
Why... are you doing this?

38:15.348 --> 38:16.548
Agh! Hey.

38:16.616 --> 38:18.751
Whoa, what... the hell's
going on out here?

38:18.818 --> 38:20.652
It said five minutes on high heat

38:20.720 --> 38:22.788
for those tofu steaks.

38:22.856 --> 38:25.053
- Wait, tofu steaks?
- Yeah.

38:25.099 --> 38:26.559
All right, all right.

38:26.659 --> 38:28.761
Sorry. Uhh! There we go.

38:29.078 --> 38:30.429
I'm sorry.

38:30.497 --> 38:33.247
I'm... trying so hard

38:33.374 --> 38:34.662
to get things right.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.581
Well... w-wait, what...

38:36.915 --> 38:38.983
Why are you trying so hard?

38:40.874 --> 38:42.943
I spent so long looking for you.

38:43.036 --> 38:44.803
In some ways...

38:44.978 --> 38:47.435
it feels like I brought back a stranger.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.909
I mean, there's so much that I missed.

38:51.391 --> 38:55.020
Places, people that I'm not a part of.

38:55.088 --> 38:57.256
Kathmandu, K&R.

38:57.323 --> 38:59.958
Dwire. Clem.

39:05.057 --> 39:06.632
Hey...

39:06.916 --> 39:08.600
go put on something nice.

39:08.668 --> 39:09.902
Let's go out.

39:09.969 --> 39:12.304
Dinner, wine. We can catch up.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.286
You know, money's a little
tight at the moment.

39:15.509 --> 39:19.412
Yeah, fancy date... prob'ly
not our best move.

39:19.612 --> 39:21.180
Yeah, about that.

39:21.247 --> 39:22.748
Hmm?

39:22.816 --> 39:23.899
Turns out...

39:25.071 --> 39:26.539
K&R pays pretty well.

39:27.772 --> 39:29.955
I was saving it for a rainy day.

39:31.558 --> 39:33.725
I mean, we could probably
still keep the apartment

39:33.793 --> 39:35.682
and go to dinner.

39:36.215 --> 39:38.616
What do you think?

39:39.051 --> 39:41.186
Dinner's gonna have to wait.

39:49.236 --> 39:51.423
- Hey.
- Hey...

39:51.578 --> 39:54.646
I'm, uh, looking for my best friend.

39:54.814 --> 39:56.882
Have you seen him?

39:56.950 --> 39:58.083
I think he moved to Langley,

39:58.151 --> 40:01.553
but you can leave the beer here, though.

40:01.621 --> 40:03.856
I'm sorry about today.

40:03.923 --> 40:06.158
I was a bit of an ass,
and I'll be better.

40:06.226 --> 40:08.106
I'm still getting used
to having you guys back.

40:08.130 --> 40:09.297
Me, too.

40:09.496 --> 40:11.396
I'll try harder to
respect your authority

40:11.464 --> 40:13.098
even though, technically,

40:13.166 --> 40:14.867
Keaton's my real boss at the CIA.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.268
Oh, you work at the CIA now?

40:16.336 --> 40:18.437
That's funny, you never mentioned it.

40:18.505 --> 40:20.205
Babe, if that's the delivery guy,

40:20.273 --> 40:23.142
make sure to tip him extra
for coming out of the zone.

40:25.011 --> 40:26.778
Are you on a date right now?

40:26.846 --> 40:28.080
Not exactly, um...

40:29.659 --> 40:30.659
Hi.

40:30.683 --> 40:32.484
This is Zapata, from work.

40:32.512 --> 40:34.080
Tasha, this is my girlfriend Megan.

40:34.105 --> 40:35.945
We were just about to sit
down and have dinner

40:35.969 --> 40:36.989
in <i>our</i> apartment.

40:37.056 --> 40:38.090
Do you want to join us?

40:38.158 --> 40:39.658
Oh, this place is so great,

40:39.726 --> 40:41.460
and we always order way too much food.

40:41.528 --> 40:42.794
Oh... phh.

40:42.862 --> 40:45.564
No, that is so nice of you, I'm...

40:45.589 --> 40:46.744
Okay, seriously, Tasha.

40:46.769 --> 40:48.703
We should have had you over ages ago.

40:48.728 --> 40:50.470
I don't know any of Ed's work friends.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.923
No, you and... you and Ed have plans...

40:52.948 --> 40:54.840
Yeah, we don't have to...
Plan for another day.

40:54.865 --> 40:56.632
- Yeah.
- Babe, she's already here.

40:56.743 --> 40:58.810
She brought drinks. This is happening.

40:59.184 --> 41:00.852
Tasha, this is happening.

41:00.899 --> 41:03.968
Okay... this is happening.

41:06.391 --> 41:07.925
This is happening.

41:08.054 --> 41:10.989
Hey, Stuart, it's me again.

41:11.057 --> 41:14.248
Uh, calling to apologize, again.

41:14.402 --> 41:17.429
Uh, listen, I... I... I haven't been...

41:17.497 --> 41:19.698
acting like myself lately.

41:19.766 --> 41:22.267
A-And you're real good at your job,

41:22.335 --> 41:25.237
and clearly, you are screening
your calls right now.

41:25.305 --> 41:27.072
I promise I won't call back

41:27.140 --> 41:29.775
because, uh... uh... I'm actually here.

41:29.999 --> 41:33.378
Uh, at your apartment,
at your door, in person.

41:33.446 --> 41:35.956
So, um, okay. Bye.

41:36.016 --> 41:37.359
Oh, and if you're in, like,
a movie or something,

41:37.383 --> 41:39.263
I'm just really sorry
about all the voicemails,

41:39.291 --> 41:40.891
and I'll just see you when you get here.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.177
Okay, bye.

41:55.428 --> 41:57.029
Stuart?

42:03.682 --> 42:04.931
Stuart?

42:11.217 --> 42:12.651
Oh, my God.

42:14.934 --> 42:16.234
Oh, no.

A mysterious clue.

42:25.338 --> 42:28.054
This tattoo exposes someone
in this very room.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.008
Reveals a spy among them.

42:30.032 --> 42:31.652
Everything is out in the open.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.946
She's dirty, we've gotta take her down.
