00:08.887 --> 00:10.184
Hi, Will.

00:11.456 --> 00:15.051
- Hey, how're you doing, Lindsey?
- Are you going to the Lakers game?

00:15.561 --> 00:17.290
I wish. I don't have no tickets.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.429
Isn't that a coincidence?

00:19.498 --> 00:23.195
Here I am with two tickets
to the Lakers game, and no one to go with.

00:24.403 --> 00:26.803
Y ou enjoy yourself tonight, all right?

00:26.872 --> 00:29.432
Too bad you can't make it.
The seats are center court.

00:29.508 --> 00:31.135
We can go in my dad's limo...

00:31.209 --> 00:33.200
and I have passes
to the after-game party...

00:33.278 --> 00:35.769
- but, yeah, well.
- Wait, wait. Whoa.

00:36.248 --> 00:38.808
I mean, hey. Who am I to be so selfish?

00:38.884 --> 00:41.614
What do you say
you pick me up around 8:00?

00:41.687 --> 00:44.554
Just for tonight,
how about you let your buns down?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

02:03.468 --> 02:06.301
Geoffrey, you look great today.

02:06.438 --> 02:08.429
Have you done something different
with your hair?

02:08.507 --> 02:10.907
Y es. I stopped pulling it out.

02:12.444 --> 02:13.877
What are you selling?

02:13.945 --> 02:16.937
Okay, I'm hawking candy bars.
They're only $5.

02:17.015 --> 02:18.915
Marvelous. With what I'm paid...

02:18.984 --> 02:22.476
I should be able to afford one
by the end of the day.

02:24.122 --> 02:26.147
Y ou poor, pathetic gigolo.

02:26.224 --> 02:29.751
How could any self-respecting man
sell himself so cheap?

02:30.095 --> 02:33.189
Like I don't hear enough of that
from my mother.

02:34.533 --> 02:39.436
- I was talking to Will.
- Of course. Why would anyone talk to me?

02:40.138 --> 02:42.868
I am but a poor, lowly servant.

02:47.245 --> 02:49.270
Carlton, I'm saying,
what's your damage, man?

02:49.347 --> 02:53.113
I mean, Lindsey just can't resist me.
It's just a Laker game, you know?

02:53.385 --> 02:56.786
Hey, besides, you know what they say
about guys with big ears?

02:58.290 --> 02:59.723
They can fly?

03:02.294 --> 03:04.194
Vivian, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

03:04.262 --> 03:06.662
Philip, I don't see why
you don't want to run.

03:06.732 --> 03:09.360
He's probably afraid
he'll crack the concrete.

03:11.236 --> 03:14.637
Will, the Allied Political Coalition
just asked your uncle...

03:14.706 --> 03:18.107
- to run for Superior Court Judge.
- Y eah.

03:18.176 --> 03:21.339
Those imbeciles are trying to railroad
Judge Robertson off the bench.

03:21.413 --> 03:24.405
I can't believe that. Judge Robertson?

03:24.483 --> 03:27.384
They had the audacity to try to do that
to Judge Robertson?

03:27.452 --> 03:29.818
Who the hell is Judge Robertson?

03:29.888 --> 03:32.721
He was your uncle's mentor
and quite a colorful person.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.725
He was a little bit eccentric.

03:35.227 --> 03:37.491
But he taught me the true meaning
of the word "justice."

03:37.829 --> 03:39.296
There were times I didn't think...

03:39.364 --> 03:42.231
I was going to make it through school,
but he wouldn't let me quit.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.598
I never would have gotten
through law school without him.

03:44.669 --> 03:47.297
What'd he do? Have the halls widened?

03:49.541 --> 03:51.441
That was a good one.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.444
For your information...

03:55.247 --> 03:58.842
he taught me not only the spirit,
but the letter of the law.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.441
God bless him.

04:01.853 --> 04:05.653
And I consider it an insult
for anyone to try to get him out of office.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.692
What do you think, Will?

04:07.759 --> 04:10.990
I think I should have never said nothing
about them halls.

04:11.930 --> 04:15.331
So did everybody watch
LA's favorite weather girl today?

04:15.400 --> 04:16.731
No.

04:17.935 --> 04:21.872
Well, I was the bright spot, as usual.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.067
I wore my new Versace.

04:24.376 --> 04:26.936
So what's the weather
going to be like tomorrow, honey?

04:27.012 --> 04:28.741
What am I, psychic?

04:37.489 --> 04:40.049
Oh, please, let me get it this time.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.422
Hilary.

04:43.895 --> 04:47.626
Y ou look so beautiful today.

04:47.699 --> 04:50.361
I was born beautiful. What are you selling?

04:50.435 --> 04:53.495
- Okay, I'll give you 10o/o off.
- I'll take two.

04:55.106 --> 04:58.667
Master William, Miss Lindsey to see you.

04:59.711 --> 05:03.738
Miss Lindsey, this is most inappropriate.
I couldn't possibly...

05:04.182 --> 05:06.173
It's Ben.

05:08.453 --> 05:09.545
Thank you.

05:11.122 --> 05:13.022
- Lindsey, what are you doing here?
- Will.

05:13.091 --> 05:14.991
Honey, that is no way to talk
to your guest.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.426
Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.
Nice to meet you.

05:17.495 --> 05:20.362
Nice to meet you, too.
Will, can I talk to you for a minute?

05:20.432 --> 05:22.957
Right this way, money... Honey. I'm sorry.

05:24.302 --> 05:25.462
Lindsey, what's up?

05:25.537 --> 05:28.529
I had a great time the other night.
It was magic.

05:28.607 --> 05:30.837
- What did you do?
- I'm talking about us, silly.

05:30.909 --> 05:33.434
I didn't want the night to end.

05:33.511 --> 05:35.911
Well, you know, nights do that sometimes.

05:36.214 --> 05:37.340
Look, Will.

05:37.415 --> 05:42.045
Since we had so much fun the other night,
I was wondering if we could...

05:42.120 --> 05:43.951
spend some time together.

05:46.558 --> 05:48.924
Look, Lindsey. I mean, I'd really love to.
I mean...

05:48.994 --> 05:50.985
but I have obligations.
I have commitments.

05:51.062 --> 05:52.825
I have a gold watch.

05:54.399 --> 05:57.027
So how about a little thank-you kiss?

06:02.240 --> 06:03.571
Thank you.

06:11.917 --> 06:14.579
Y o, G, here's the whipped cream
you wanted for dinner.

06:14.653 --> 06:16.746
Who said it was for dinner?

06:21.927 --> 06:26.296
Hey, Carlton, what time is it?
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.

06:27.332 --> 06:30.893
I'm only wearing
the finest timepiece ever made.

06:31.002 --> 06:34.961
This gold model was handcrafted
in Switzerland by the finest of craftsmen.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.305
Keeps time accurate
to within three seconds a year.

06:39.477 --> 06:41.001
Love the Casio.

06:42.447 --> 06:44.608
Will, you're nothing more than a trollop...

06:44.683 --> 06:48.414
a strumpet, a love slave, <i>sans</i> the love.

06:48.486 --> 06:52.820
I'm sorry, Carlton, I couldn't hear you.
My damn watch was just ticking so loud.

06:53.758 --> 06:56.693
Y ou just don't have the fortitude to say no.

06:57.228 --> 07:01.096
Carlton, please. I mean, I have no choice.
I'm the chosen one.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.656
I mean, take Moses...

07:02.734 --> 07:06.727
when he was asked to part the Red Sea,
did he say, "No, y'all build a dam"?

07:07.305 --> 07:10.468
- Vivian, do I look okay?
- Philip, honey, would you relax?

07:10.542 --> 07:13.272
- We're just having company for dinner.
- It's not just company.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.676
It's Judge Robertson.

07:14.746 --> 07:18.739
He's done so much for me over the years,
this is my chance to finally pay him back.

07:18.817 --> 07:21.251
Baby, we're just having pot roast.

07:21.886 --> 07:24.252
- Is the judge here, yet?
- No, honey, not yet.

07:24.322 --> 07:26.552
Good, then I have plenty of time
to plant this.

07:26.624 --> 07:28.558
- Hilary, what is that?
- It's a bug.

07:28.626 --> 07:30.253
They gave it to me down at the newsroom.

07:30.328 --> 07:32.159
If I can scoop some dirt
on Judge Robertson...

07:32.230 --> 07:34.027
it could mean a big promotion.

07:34.099 --> 07:37.125
I feel just like Deborah Norville,
except I have a job.

07:37.569 --> 07:39.833
Hilary, forget it.

07:40.138 --> 07:41.537
This man is our guest.

07:41.606 --> 07:43.904
Let's just show him
the respect he deserves.

07:44.509 --> 07:46.340
Here comes the judge.

07:47.746 --> 07:50.613
Here comes the judge. Order in the court!

07:51.583 --> 07:53.073
Here comes the judge.

07:56.021 --> 07:59.081
It wouldn't kill you to crack a smile,
you know.

08:13.872 --> 08:15.863
Judge Robertson,
it's so good to see you, sir.

08:15.940 --> 08:18.374
It's so easy to see you, Philip.

08:20.378 --> 08:24.439
Looks like you haven't stepped
on the scales of justice in quite some time.

08:27.685 --> 08:30.586
Did you hear what he said? He was...

08:33.091 --> 08:35.924
I'm laughing at something
that happened yesterday.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.624
I'm done now.

08:40.597 --> 08:43.931
I remember you. Y ou're Carlton.

08:46.137 --> 08:48.765
I've known you since you were yea high.

08:52.243 --> 08:54.939
Ain't nothing wrong with his memory.

08:55.013 --> 08:57.413
Y ou got that right.
Forget everything you heard about me.

08:57.482 --> 09:01.248
There may be snow on the roof,
but there's still fire in the furnace.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.620
And hello, Vivian.

09:06.057 --> 09:09.356
Philip, your wife gets more youthful
with every passing year.

09:09.427 --> 09:12.260
No, excuse me, Judge, no,
this is my daughter Hilary.

09:12.831 --> 09:14.458
This is my wife, Vivian.

09:15.133 --> 09:16.532
Y ou've aged.

09:19.404 --> 09:21.838
And what the hell is that you're wearing?

09:21.906 --> 09:23.874
Why don't we come over here?

09:26.244 --> 09:28.041
Dinner is served.

09:28.113 --> 09:29.205
Benson.

09:35.286 --> 09:37.652
I didn't know you were really a butler.

09:44.963 --> 09:47.090
That Judge Robertson's quite a character.

09:47.165 --> 09:49.793
But, Aunt Viv,
how come he keep calling you Weezie?

09:51.302 --> 09:53.668
I am sorry, Philip,
that man is beyond eccentric.

09:53.738 --> 09:56.639
I asked him to pass the salt.
He told me to go long.

09:56.975 --> 10:00.604
- He was joking, Vivian.
- Philip, he broke a window.

10:01.146 --> 10:02.511
He's a sexist pig.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.480
Hilary, that's not true. He's pro-choice.

10:04.549 --> 10:06.574
Daddy, he said the only choice
a woman should have...

10:06.651 --> 10:08.380
is with or without the lights on.

10:10.355 --> 10:13.688
See, now that's disgusting.
The lights should be off.

10:15.260 --> 10:16.557
Believe me, son.

10:16.628 --> 10:18.459
The only time a woman should sit
on the bench...

10:18.530 --> 10:20.430
is when she's waiting for a bus.

10:20.698 --> 10:24.429
That's ridiculous.
What if she's serving coleslaw at a picnic?

10:25.170 --> 10:28.401
Point taken.
Y ou have the makings of a fine judge.

10:30.074 --> 10:31.371
So Judge Robertson...

10:31.442 --> 10:33.933
you were telling us
about your most recent decision.

10:34.012 --> 10:36.480
Y es, I had this boy before me recently...

10:36.548 --> 10:38.345
no preponderance of evidence
in either way.

10:38.416 --> 10:41.852
It was a tough call, but in the end,
I had to convict.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.651
- How did you decide?
- Y ou see, the prosecutor was a babe...

10:45.723 --> 10:49.181
so after I decided in her favor,
she decided in mine.

10:50.628 --> 10:52.823
Lordy, look at the time.

10:52.897 --> 10:54.956
Judge, let me walk you to your car.

10:55.033 --> 10:57.558
Good, maybe you can remember
where I parked.

11:07.245 --> 11:09.509
- Hi, Will.
- Lindsey, how you doing?

11:09.581 --> 11:13.381
Will, I was wondering, if you'd like to go
with me to the autumn dance.

11:13.651 --> 11:14.675
Wow.

11:15.753 --> 11:17.345
Look, Lindsey, now...

11:17.422 --> 11:21.415
I mean, you've been very generous,
you know, but I just can't...

11:21.893 --> 11:23.827
Motorcycle helmet.

11:23.895 --> 11:26.557
But, Lindsey, I mean, I can't take...

11:27.565 --> 11:30.728
Wow, a motorcycle jacket
with Malcolm on it.

11:30.802 --> 11:33.498
I can ride and be righteous
at the same time.

11:33.571 --> 11:36.665
- Look, but, Lindsey, I'm sorry...
- These go to your new Harley-Davidson.

11:36.741 --> 11:39.107
Now what were you gonna say?

11:40.111 --> 11:41.442
Thank you.

11:46.384 --> 11:49.080
Y eah, right, like you wouldn't take it.

12:00.331 --> 12:01.389
- Will.
- Hey.

12:01.466 --> 12:04.367
- How did this get on the patio?
- No, don't worry, Aunt Viv.

12:04.435 --> 12:07.131
I was careful when I drove it
through the house.

12:07.338 --> 12:10.705
- I mean where did it come from?
- The Harley factory.

12:11.609 --> 12:13.770
Will, it came from Lindsey, didn't it?

12:13.845 --> 12:17.008
Now, what I want to know is
what does she get in return?

12:17.248 --> 12:19.375
All the rides she wants, Aunt Viv.

12:20.451 --> 12:22.214
Y ou are acting like a pimp.

12:22.287 --> 12:24.551
Come on, hold up now.
That is totally unfair, Aunt Viv.

12:24.622 --> 12:26.385
If a man was buying a woman
all these gifts...

12:26.457 --> 12:28.425
nobody would have anything
to say about it, right?

12:28.493 --> 12:30.461
Honey, it doesn't matter
if you're a man or a woman.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.826
If you don't care for someone,
you shouldn't accept gifts.

12:32.897 --> 12:35.923
And it diminishes you every time
you accept something from Lindsey.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.833
Now you were not raised that way, boy,
and you know it.

12:39.971 --> 12:42.531
Now you know what you need to do,
don't you?

12:42.607 --> 12:44.006
Y eah, put out.

12:47.278 --> 12:49.872
I know. I got to give all this stuff back.

12:49.947 --> 12:53.110
- And?
- And got to be honest with her.

12:53.985 --> 12:56.078
And you know that's right.

13:02.026 --> 13:04.358
If I keep the bike, I'm a pimp.

13:05.530 --> 13:08.021
If I give it back, I'm a damn fool.

13:10.802 --> 13:12.429
Well, pimp it is.

13:18.376 --> 13:20.674
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby.

13:21.679 --> 13:23.271
Chocolate?

13:23.348 --> 13:26.613
Forget it, honey.
At $5 a pop, I'm not sharing.

13:27.485 --> 13:29.112
I am so angry.

13:29.187 --> 13:30.848
Okay, here. Y ou can have a bite.

13:30.922 --> 13:32.981
No, it's about Judge Robertson.

13:33.057 --> 13:35.890
Y ou know, he is sitting up on that bench
for all the wrong reasons.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.394
Unless somebody runs against him,
he'll be up there forever.

13:38.463 --> 13:40.090
Well, who'd you have in mind?

13:40.798 --> 13:42.265
I don't know.

13:42.333 --> 13:46.235
Somebody dynamic, principled.

13:47.171 --> 13:49.935
Someone who looks good in a black robe.

13:50.141 --> 13:51.631
Jesse Jackson?

13:52.810 --> 13:54.300
No, me.

13:55.012 --> 13:58.345
I know, baby. I always thought
you'd make a fabulous judge.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.177
Y ou sure, baby?

14:01.252 --> 14:03.277
I mean, this could mean big changes
for all of us.

14:03.354 --> 14:06.619
I know, but it could also mean big changes
for the people in this city.

14:06.691 --> 14:08.488
Maybe for the better.

14:08.893 --> 14:12.158
- I love you, Vivian.
- I love you, too, Philip.

14:13.664 --> 14:17.122
Get your hands off my chocolate,
or you're a dead man.

14:22.173 --> 14:25.574
Here's Judge Robertson at that
big student anti-war rally, remember?

14:25.643 --> 14:27.508
He was the only professor
that had guts enough...

14:27.578 --> 14:29.478
to go up against the administration.

14:29.547 --> 14:32.107
- I can't believe it.
- Trust me, Hilary.

14:32.183 --> 14:34.276
He was a great man and a hell of a lawyer.

14:34.352 --> 14:38.118
No, I mean, that those women didn't shave
under their arms.

14:41.159 --> 14:42.251
Hey, Uncle Phil, hold up.

14:42.326 --> 14:44.453
Who's that skinny, weird dude
standing next to you?

14:44.529 --> 14:46.019
That's me.

14:48.599 --> 14:50.499
That's a relief,
'cause I was about to wonder...

14:50.568 --> 14:53.264
why Uncle Phil was holding
that dude's hand.

14:53.337 --> 14:55.396
Look, he'll be here any minute.

14:55.473 --> 14:58.237
How am I going to tell him
that I'm running against him?

14:58.376 --> 15:00.901
I mean, how do you tell somebody
that used to be your hero...

15:00.978 --> 15:02.707
that he's become
completely incompetent?

15:02.780 --> 15:06.375
Well, big guy, may I suggest
using flash cards with really big pictures?

15:07.985 --> 15:12.081
Don't worry, sweetheart, if he's the man
that you think he is, he'll understand.

15:12.156 --> 15:16.422
If he's the man I think he is, he'll probably
get lost on his way to the bathroom.

15:18.796 --> 15:20.388
Judge Robertson.

15:20.998 --> 15:24.195
- Thanks, Benson.
- For the last time, sir...

15:24.469 --> 15:26.096
I am not Benson.

15:26.671 --> 15:28.366
Sure, right.

15:30.775 --> 15:32.834
- How are you doing, Judge?
- I'm fine, yeah.

15:33.411 --> 15:36.175
Well, we'll leave you two alone.
Come on, kids.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.375
Good night, nice seeing you again.

15:40.985 --> 15:43.886
Not only has she aged,
she has a beer belly.

15:46.924 --> 15:50.883
- That's my wife and she's pregnant.
- Then she should lay off the beer.

15:53.698 --> 15:55.928
Would you take a seat, please?

15:56.734 --> 16:00.830
Judge Robertson, I hear
that you're running for reelection and...

16:00.905 --> 16:04.636
And you want to make
a big fat contribution. Good.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.267
Make the check out to cash.

16:06.344 --> 16:08.278
In fact,
why don't you just give me the cash?

16:08.346 --> 16:09.973
Or maybe that ring.

16:11.382 --> 16:12.906
That's good.

16:12.984 --> 16:14.451
No, Carl.

16:15.019 --> 16:17.954
Look, there's something
I want to tell you...

16:18.389 --> 16:22.382
- but I can't seem to find the words.
- Well, where did you have them last?

16:23.961 --> 16:25.292
No.

16:25.730 --> 16:28.631
I'm talking about what's happened to you.

16:28.699 --> 16:32.032
- I'll be frank.
- Okay, and who am I?

16:37.775 --> 16:38.799
No.

16:39.377 --> 16:42.005
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

16:42.079 --> 16:44.240
that maybe you've served
the community long enough...

16:44.315 --> 16:48.046
and as your friend,
I think I should tell you that...

16:48.586 --> 16:51.020
well, maybe it's time for you to retire.

16:51.589 --> 16:53.989
Me, retire? Oh, Frank.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.955
Have you lost your mind?

17:01.032 --> 17:05.526
I mean, this is the cushiest job in town.
I get free coffee, validated parking...

17:05.603 --> 17:09.266
I don't have to wear pants, and besides,
there's no one to run against me.

17:09.339 --> 17:10.602
Y es, there is.

17:10.675 --> 17:12.165
- Who?
- Me.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.808
Y ou! Y ou've got to be kidding.

17:14.878 --> 17:17.108
Y ou don't know the first thing
about running for office.

17:17.181 --> 17:20.412
- I taught you about law, not politics.
- Look, the point is...

17:20.483 --> 17:23.578
I'm going to run against you,
and I thought I should tell you face to face.

17:23.654 --> 17:26.384
Oh, yes? Well, let me tell you something
face to face.

17:26.624 --> 17:29.149
I am a very worthy opponent.

17:30.528 --> 17:32.758
And I can see myself in your head.

17:34.398 --> 17:35.956
Benson, my car.

17:58.823 --> 18:01.690
Wow. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

18:06.597 --> 18:10.431
Judge? Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

18:10.501 --> 18:14.938
- I don't know, don't I live here?
- No, Judge, you don't.

18:17.441 --> 18:19.932
No wonder the garage door opener
didn't work.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.377
It took forever to pry it open.

18:25.950 --> 18:28.350
- Look, Judge.
- Juice?

18:28.886 --> 18:30.854
No. No, thanks. Look...

18:30.921 --> 18:33.719
I got some problems, you know,
I got to deal with tonight.

18:33.791 --> 18:35.725
- Woman problems.
- Women.

18:35.793 --> 18:38.557
They've been a problem
ever since they got the right to vote.

18:38.629 --> 18:41.689
Sit down, son, sit down.
Talk to me, sonny, talk to me.

18:41.766 --> 18:44.701
I've had my share of problems
with women.

18:45.069 --> 18:48.334
Actually, Judge, it's this girl at school,
Lindsey, right?

18:48.406 --> 18:51.034
She just keep buying me all these fly gifts.

18:51.275 --> 18:53.402
So what's the problem?

18:53.477 --> 18:57.675
- Well, I'm not really attracted to her.
- So what's the problem?

18:59.083 --> 19:01.313
My Aunt Viv told me that, you know...

19:01.385 --> 19:03.979
it's not right to accept gifts
from people that, you know...

19:04.055 --> 19:06.853
- you're not really attracted to.
- Look, son...

19:06.924 --> 19:09.688
I remember when I was your age,
there was this girl...

19:09.760 --> 19:11.489
I didn't like her that much...

19:11.562 --> 19:15.430
she was always buying me gifts, dinner,
taking me out.

19:15.499 --> 19:19.629
Heck, she even offered to send me
through law school.

19:20.371 --> 19:24.137
- So what did you do?
- What else? I married her.

19:25.876 --> 19:28.970
- Pie?
- No, thanks, Judge.

19:29.046 --> 19:31.378
So, wait,
you're just going to tell me that...

19:31.449 --> 19:35.783
you got together with this girl, and you
had this long, incredible, wonderful life.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.215
I wish I could tell you that.

19:38.289 --> 19:41.816
But the truth is,
I dumped her after law school.

19:42.693 --> 19:44.024
I'm sorry, Judge, that's too bad.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.825
No, it's okay.
We split everything down the middle.

19:46.897 --> 19:51.857
I got the money, the house, the car,
the boat, and she got to keep the kids.

19:54.305 --> 19:56.466
- Pie?
- No. No, thanks.

19:56.574 --> 19:59.270
So you're saying
that you just kept all this stuff...

19:59.343 --> 20:01.208
that she gave you,
even after y'all broke up?

20:01.278 --> 20:04.805
Damn straight. Possession
is nine-tenths of the law, my boy.

20:10.488 --> 20:11.512
Y o.

20:13.924 --> 20:16.154
Look, Lindsey, I told you I'm busy.

20:16.227 --> 20:19.560
<i>But /'m in the neighborhood, rea//y c/ose.</i>

20:20.264 --> 20:21.993
How close, Lindsey?

20:31.275 --> 20:32.799
Princess Leia!

20:33.744 --> 20:35.473
May the force be with you.

20:37.648 --> 20:41.607
- Will, somebody broke into your garage.
- Quick, call the police.

20:42.553 --> 20:44.953
Lindsey, can I talk to you for a second?

20:45.389 --> 20:47.653
Look, what are you doing here?

20:49.527 --> 20:52.690
- As if I didn't know, right?
- It's over, Will.

20:52.763 --> 20:55.459
- See what I'm saying? It's what?
- Over.

20:55.533 --> 20:59.162
- But why?
- Why ask why? Look at her.

21:02.206 --> 21:04.504
I'm not attracted to you, Will.

21:05.743 --> 21:09.179
- Y eah. Y es, you are.
- No. No, I'm not.

21:09.246 --> 21:12.010
- I've never been attracted to you.
- Well...

21:12.082 --> 21:14.516
Then why did you buy me all this stuff?

21:14.585 --> 21:17.019
Well, you're
captain of the basketball team...

21:17.488 --> 21:21.822
you're popular, and being seen with you at
the autumn dance made me popular, too.

21:21.892 --> 21:24.122
But now your job is done.

21:24.795 --> 21:26.729
That woman is ruthless.

21:27.865 --> 21:29.833
Y ou ever think about going into politics?

21:29.900 --> 21:32.198
- Y eah. As a matter of fact, l...
- Whoa.

21:33.604 --> 21:37.335
I'm saying, Lindsey,
I mean, what about me as a person?

21:37.408 --> 21:40.639
What about the way
that my cheeks dimple when I smile?

21:40.711 --> 21:42.474
And what color are my eyes?

21:42.546 --> 21:44.309
Look at you all quiet.
Y ou don't even know.

21:44.381 --> 21:45.780
Who cares?

21:49.954 --> 21:51.285
Who cares?

21:53.791 --> 21:56.692
I feel so used, so cheap.

21:57.561 --> 22:01.520
Y ou certainly weren't cheap.
Cost me a fortune.

22:01.765 --> 22:04.825
I want my stuff back. Now.

22:05.269 --> 22:07.169
- Wait. But...
- Now!

22:10.207 --> 22:14.200
Y ou take this ring back, 'cause
my mother don't scream at me like that.

22:15.279 --> 22:18.373
Watch back,
and you can take this jacket back.

22:20.885 --> 22:23.979
Nice meeting you, young lady.
Be sure to rock the vote.

22:24.722 --> 22:26.053
Good night.

22:34.832 --> 22:36.800
Y ou know, Judge...

22:36.867 --> 22:39.597
I never thought saying goodbye
would be so hard.

22:40.771 --> 22:42.762
I really loved that watch.

22:48.212 --> 22:49.839
He was a little eccentric.

22:49.914 --> 22:53.281
But, he traught... Taught me that.
And soon as I say this... Let's do it again.

22:53.350 --> 22:54.578
- He traught you?
- Y eah, he traught me.

22:54.652 --> 22:56.449
- What'd he traught you?
- He traught me how to...

22:56.520 --> 22:57.817
Oops.

23:08.265 --> 23:10.256
- <i>And /et's go do this again.</i>
- <i>Damn.</i>
