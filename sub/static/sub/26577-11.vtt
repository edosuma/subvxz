WEBVTT

00:03.638 --> 00:05.071
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05.140 --> 00:07.251
The school called the house.
They're trying to reach you.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.075
Funny how you go to school there

00:09.144 --> 00:11.611
and yet they can't seem to find you.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.046
I'm on the school grounds.

00:13.148 --> 00:15.481
I'm just places where
they can't find me.

00:16.518 --> 00:18.518
What does that mean? Are you tunneling?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.097
Are you in the trees?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.455
No. I go places to read.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.626
Fine. The school has a bomb shelter.

00:26.695 --> 00:28.039
I figured I'd have the place to myself

00:28.063 --> 00:31.030
unless somebody in Washington
makes a really big mistake.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.066
All right, stop doing that.

00:33.168 --> 00:35.068
And the office said
they need a Word document

00:35.136 --> 00:37.603
of your article so they can
print it in the school paper.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.772
My article's going in the paper?

00:39.841 --> 00:42.075
You had good news, and
you were screwing with me?

00:42.177 --> 00:44.043
Well, I don't play tennis or anything,

00:44.145 --> 00:46.379
so I have to have some fun.

00:46.448 --> 00:47.892
Can you at least tell
me what it's called?

00:47.916 --> 00:49.048
Yeah. It's an article called

00:49.117 --> 00:50.650
"My Mom Has No Life of Her Own,

00:50.752 --> 00:52.712
So She's Desperately Trying
to Live Through Mine."

00:53.855 --> 00:56.222
Oh, my God. It's the
Ghost of Children Past.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.894
Wow. What's with the massive
amount of baby supplies?

01:01.996 --> 01:03.396
It's for Becky.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.298
We were at the mall, grabbing some tools

01:05.367 --> 01:06.933
before they close the Sears,

01:07.001 --> 01:10.136
and there's a baby store
folding up right next door.

01:10.205 --> 01:12.338
You know, it used to be a Brookstone

01:12.407 --> 01:15.208
that used to be a RadioShack
that used to be a Spencer Gifts.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.810
The people in the baby store,

01:17.879 --> 01:19.912
they thought we were a couple.

01:19.981 --> 01:24.150
Sometimes, the younger man
needs the older man's wisdom.

01:26.054 --> 01:28.621
Wait. You and Emilio went
shopping for baby stuff?

01:28.690 --> 01:30.101
We almost grabbed you a stroller, too,

01:30.125 --> 01:32.125
but we thought you'd
like to pick that out.

01:32.193 --> 01:36.496
But we did get you a breast pump.

01:37.899 --> 01:39.866
"For all shape and sizes."

01:41.069 --> 01:42.602
So a stroller is too personal,

01:42.670 --> 01:45.538
but the breast pump, you
figured, "What the hell?"

01:45.607 --> 01:47.207
If you'd like to buy
something different,

01:47.275 --> 01:48.395
I can take it back tomorrow.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.143
Thank you.

01:53.815 --> 01:56.315
You want to hear
something incredibly sad?

01:56.418 --> 01:58.317
Who doesn't?

01:58.420 --> 02:00.887
Ben asked me and the kids

02:00.955 --> 02:04.290
to live with him in
Chicago, but I can't go.

02:04.359 --> 02:05.992
Why not?

02:06.004 --> 02:08.170
Well, I promised you I'd stay here

02:08.239 --> 02:10.440
to be here for you and the baby, so...

02:10.508 --> 02:12.642
Oh, yeah. Right. Good.

02:12.711 --> 02:15.378
Uh, and it's such a great opportunity.

02:15.447 --> 02:17.780
I mean, I can work
at a big-city tabloid,

02:17.849 --> 02:20.183
and the kids can be in
the city that they love.

02:20.285 --> 02:22.585
It's really a shame, but oh, well.

02:23.421 --> 02:25.588
I'm giving you an
opportunity to be gracious

02:25.657 --> 02:27.168
while I'm trying to
renege on my promise.

02:27.192 --> 02:29.058
I could use a little help here.

02:30.128 --> 02:32.795
Of course you should
go, you little whiner.

02:34.699 --> 02:36.566
But you still have to keep your promise.

02:36.634 --> 02:37.700
If I go into rehab,

02:37.769 --> 02:39.836
I'm FedExing the baby to you in Chicago.

02:40.839 --> 02:42.650
Okay, just don't make it
where I have to sign for it,

02:42.674 --> 02:43.914
'cause sometimes I'm not there.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074

in front of a live studio audience.

03:26.151 --> 03:27.984
- Hey, Jackie. I'm home.
- Hey!

03:28.086 --> 03:29.819
Oh, you are really missing some fun

03:29.921 --> 03:32.255
at the Renaissance Winter Fair.

03:32.357 --> 03:34.690
Today, we recreated the
stacking of the bodies

03:34.793 --> 03:37.493
that were found under
the Great Snow of 1430.

03:39.597 --> 03:40.863
Oh, my God.

03:40.965 --> 03:42.365
Oh, my God.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.233
Oh, my God. You finally did it.

03:44.335 --> 03:47.570
I know she was horrible to you, but...

03:47.639 --> 03:49.338
but she was your mother.

03:49.441 --> 03:51.601
Now, we're gonna have to say
that this was an accident.

03:51.643 --> 03:52.975
What?

03:53.077 --> 03:54.243
These are drapes.

03:54.345 --> 03:56.245
You thought this was Bev?

03:56.347 --> 03:58.414
No. No. Oh.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.750
She's at the dog races in Dubuque.

04:00.852 --> 04:02.285
Oh, my God. No.

04:02.387 --> 04:04.253
It would've been cool, though, huh?

04:04.355 --> 04:05.588
Yeah.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.191
Well, I... I... I've only
known her a short while,

04:08.293 --> 04:11.661
- but yes. Yes.
- That's why I love you. Mwah!

04:11.763 --> 04:13.203
Well, since you love me, may I throw

04:13.231 --> 04:16.031
some of my outfits from
the fair into the laundry?

04:16.134 --> 04:17.266
Oh, sure.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.275
What's this? Oh.

04:26.377 --> 04:29.479
Oh, that's a 15th century
ladies' undergarment.

04:29.581 --> 04:32.081
Those pouches are called "breastbags."

04:32.183 --> 04:33.183
Ah.

04:33.218 --> 04:34.917
Well, the history's fascinating,

04:35.019 --> 04:37.720
but whose breasts fill up the bags?

04:37.822 --> 04:38.955
I don't know.

04:39.057 --> 04:41.224
There is a communal
changing tent at the fair.

04:41.326 --> 04:43.059
I... I must have
grabbed the wrong things.

04:43.161 --> 04:46.062
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

04:47.398 --> 04:49.465
Are you suggesting that
I'm cheating on you?

04:49.567 --> 04:51.667
You're... you're being ridiculous.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.569
I'm only asking for the truth.

04:53.671 --> 04:54.971
I gave you the truth,

04:55.073 --> 04:58.140
but if you keep accusing me
of being unfaithful to you,

04:58.243 --> 05:00.142
I'm gonna go ahead and do it.

05:00.245 --> 05:03.145
I... I might as well, if I'm
gonna get blamed for it anyway.

05:03.248 --> 05:04.313
All right, sorry.

05:04.415 --> 05:06.849
Just give whosever
breastbags these are back,

05:06.951 --> 05:09.819
- and I won't mention it again.
- Okay.

05:09.921 --> 05:12.855
Okay, I... I'll put them
in the lost and found.

05:12.924 --> 05:16.292
Yesterday, somebody misplaced
a small bag of dove's droppings,

05:16.361 --> 05:18.694
- which were used to lighten one's hair.
- Oh.

05:18.763 --> 05:21.797
And somebody else was looking
for their homemade toothpaste.

05:21.866 --> 05:24.166
It was an unfortunate coincidence.

05:24.269 --> 05:25.501
Mm.

05:29.073 --> 05:31.541
- Snowblower broken again?
- Yep.

05:31.643 --> 05:32.742
These sudden winter storms

05:32.844 --> 05:35.011
catch all kinds of things by surprise.

05:35.113 --> 05:37.480
So, basically, it's been
a frozen gopher shooter.

05:39.851 --> 05:40.851
Poof!

05:40.919 --> 05:42.785
Waah!

05:42.854 --> 05:45.888
Good fun.

05:45.990 --> 05:48.024
Uh, well...

05:48.126 --> 05:49.559
I got something to tell you.

05:49.661 --> 05:51.627
Yes?

05:51.696 --> 05:55.565
Ben asked me and the
kids to move to Chicago.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.267
He got an offer to relocate
the paper to a bigger market.

05:58.369 --> 06:00.236
Wow. Big step.

06:00.338 --> 06:01.537
What'd you say?

06:01.606 --> 06:03.005
Well, I didn't say anything yet.

06:03.074 --> 06:04.574
I wanted to talk to you first.

06:04.676 --> 06:06.709
Well, you have my blessing.

06:06.811 --> 06:10.413
I personally think Lanford's on
the cusp of a renaissance, but...

06:11.649 --> 06:14.350
... if you want to go, it's your call.

06:14.419 --> 06:16.852
Mm. You sure you're okay with it?

06:16.955 --> 06:18.087
Yeah.

06:18.189 --> 06:21.023
I enjoy my privacy, and
you're only an hour away.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.525
All right, pop quiz.

06:22.627 --> 06:24.638
You forget to take your
blood-pressure meds in the morning.

06:24.662 --> 06:25.662
What do you do?

06:25.763 --> 06:27.997
I grab me a handful
of whatever's closest

06:28.099 --> 06:30.399
and wash it down with a beer.

06:30.501 --> 06:32.602
But no pork rinds. Too much salt, right?

06:34.272 --> 06:36.839
All right, you pass. I'm out of here.

06:36.941 --> 06:38.307
Good.

06:38.409 --> 06:39.553
I'm gonna need a break anyway

06:39.577 --> 06:42.111
before Becky moves in with the baby.

06:42.213 --> 06:43.446
You know that's coming.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.812
I got to rest a minute.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.814
This kid is only the
size of a blueberry.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.282
Why am I so tired?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.517
Here.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.786
You probably need some water.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.788
Thanks.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.126
This will be a good park
to bring our baby to.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.672
It is like the one
where my papa taught me

07:09.696 --> 07:11.663
how to play soccer in Chihuahua.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.134
Aunt Jackie has done an amazing
job improving your English,

07:16.202 --> 07:18.202
but a Chihuahua is a dog.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.507
Chihuahua is where I grew up in Mexico.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.542
We'll agree to disagree.

07:25.845 --> 07:31.082
I think it is time for you
to have something to eat.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.184
Aww. That's so thoughtful.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.288
It's, uh, tuna casserole
with potato chips on top.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.791
That's my favorite.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.826
Yes. Your papa told me.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.896
He say it is part of
your white heritage.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.672
This is delicious.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.007
Mm.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.281
Listen.

08:03.349 --> 08:06.184
I'm sorry it took me so
long to give you a chance.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.986
You're a good guy, Emilio.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.056
And I'm a good person, too. I just...

08:12.125 --> 08:15.326
never imagined my life
would be like this...

08:15.395 --> 08:17.762
sitting and eating in the park
with the father of my child,

08:17.864 --> 08:20.565
who I barely know.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.233
That is funny,

08:22.302 --> 08:26.337
because this is what I dreamed
my life would be like...

08:26.406 --> 08:27.972
sitting in a park,

08:28.041 --> 08:31.509
getting to know a strong
and beautiful woman like you

08:31.578 --> 08:33.578
who's about to have my baby.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.981
That is so sweet.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.750
It is the truth.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.596
Hey.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.298
Is that my laundry on the
floor out in the hallway?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.767
Yeah. I threw it there.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.337
- Have you been drinking?
- Uh, I'll ask the questions.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.372
Explain this.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.077
This is my phone bill.
Why do you have it?

09:06.146 --> 09:09.180
Uh, because if you're
gonna cheat on somebody,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.682
you should be smart enough to
pay your own damn phone bill

09:11.785 --> 09:14.218
so you're the only person
that has access to it,

09:14.287 --> 09:18.456
because the number that comes up
most on that bill is Breastbags.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.893
Breastbags has a PhD

09:21.961 --> 09:24.996
in 16th century music and costuming.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.465
I call her frequently to be
sure I'm dressed correctly

09:27.534 --> 09:29.801
and humming the right madrigal.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.102
Really?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.404
Because when I talked to her,

09:33.473 --> 09:35.640
I asked her about the
shirt, and she said,

09:35.742 --> 09:38.709
"Oh, my boyfriend must have
accidentally grabbed it."

09:38.812 --> 09:40.311
You son of a bitch.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.579
Oh, Jackie.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.548
Oh, Jackie, this is unnecessary.

09:43.616 --> 09:44.849
It doesn't mean anything.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.818
It doesn't mean anything?

09:46.920 --> 09:50.087
Yes. Yes, I'm with you and not her.

09:50.156 --> 09:53.157
A... a stupid affair doesn't
mean I love you any less.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.592
Don't throw what we have away

09:54.694 --> 09:57.128
by being so narrow-minded
and provincial.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.664
Don't play your mind games with me.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.165
This isn't my fault.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.633
Isn't it, Jackie?

10:05.004 --> 10:08.139
Don't let your insecurity
drive away another man.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.041
Oh, my God.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.243
Dan told me you were
taking advantage of me,

10:12.345 --> 10:14.245
and I didn't listen 'cause I was weak.

10:14.347 --> 10:19.050
- You're not weak.
- Uh, yo... well, not anymore I'm not.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.985
Oh, ow! Ow! Ow!

10:21.054 --> 10:22.331
- Th... that hurt. That hurt!
- Good!

10:22.355 --> 10:23.833
Well, then that means
I'm doing it right.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.223
Oh, this is beneath you, Jackie.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.757
Beneath me. You're beneath me.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.292
- I trusted you!
- I'm...

10:28.361 --> 10:31.195
- That really hurt.
- Get the hell out!

10:31.297 --> 10:32.430
God.

10:32.532 --> 10:33.564
Aah!

10:42.120 --> 10:46.155
Okay, so, nothing is
written in stone yet,

10:46.224 --> 10:50.426
but Ben asked us to move
in with him in Chicago.

10:50.528 --> 10:52.161
What? That's crazy!

10:52.263 --> 10:53.729
Oh, my God!

10:53.831 --> 10:55.665
I love you!

10:55.767 --> 10:56.966
I'm gonna go pack now.

10:57.035 --> 10:59.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
I didn't even say yes yet.

10:59.671 --> 11:01.537
Here. Use my phone.

11:01.639 --> 11:03.406
Oh, you're letting
me look at your phone?

11:03.474 --> 11:05.841
I don't like the way you said that.

11:07.178 --> 11:09.645
But if we go back to Chicago,
how are we gonna see our dad?

11:09.747 --> 11:12.848
Oh, well, we'll come visit,
and he can come there.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.250
What about Grandpa?

11:14.319 --> 11:15.618
He can come see us, too,

11:15.687 --> 11:18.120
and he'll still have
Aunt Jackie and Becky.

11:18.189 --> 11:20.234
Plus, we're leaving the chickens
here to keep him company,

11:20.258 --> 11:21.424
which amuses me to no end.

11:23.361 --> 11:25.461
Did you call a moving company already?

11:32.303 --> 11:34.270
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:34.339 --> 11:35.905
You surprising the kids?

11:35.974 --> 11:38.007
Probably, but I'm gonna
surprise you first.

11:38.109 --> 11:39.208
I broke up with Blue.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.143
What?

11:41.245 --> 11:42.311
Why?

11:42.380 --> 11:44.814
She wanted kids, and
I just couldn't do it.

11:44.882 --> 11:46.749
Yeah, well, that's a
good call on your part.

11:46.818 --> 11:49.218
Little Moonshine and Epiphany
would have respiratory problems

11:49.320 --> 11:51.354
from all that sage.

11:51.422 --> 11:54.290
She wanted the whole works...

11:54.359 --> 11:56.459
um, marriage, everything.

11:56.527 --> 11:59.929
When you and I did it, I
knew that I wanted it, but...

11:59.998 --> 12:01.731
she's not you.

12:04.102 --> 12:05.434
Don't... don't do this.

12:05.536 --> 12:07.303
You know I'm in a relationship.

12:07.405 --> 12:10.473
I was in one just half an hour ago.

12:11.776 --> 12:13.409
There's a couple of things you can say

12:13.511 --> 12:16.078
to end it right away.

12:16.147 --> 12:19.081
One is "flaky." That'll get a
toaster in the air real quick.

12:20.084 --> 12:22.568
D... David, do you think
you can just come in here

12:22.569 --> 12:24.387
and I'm gonna drop
everything?! Are you high?

12:25.590 --> 12:26.956
A little.

12:28.559 --> 12:30.526
Yes, I'm hoping you will.

12:32.196 --> 12:35.264
Okay, come on.

12:35.366 --> 12:37.233
I did everything I
said I was going to do.

12:37.335 --> 12:39.802
I got a steady job. I'm
in my kids' lives now.

12:39.904 --> 12:41.504
There's no reason...

12:41.606 --> 12:43.339
no reason we should not be together.

12:43.408 --> 12:45.408
I... I can think of one.

12:45.510 --> 12:48.144
Ben just asked me and the kids
to move to Chicago with him.

12:50.581 --> 12:51.781
Okay, tell him no.

12:52.784 --> 12:54.083
Wow.

12:54.152 --> 12:57.053
Are you really gonna bail on me
to move in with some stranger?

12:57.155 --> 12:58.788
You mean like you did with Blue?

12:58.890 --> 12:59.955
Hey.

13:00.058 --> 13:01.824
You said we were done.

13:01.893 --> 13:03.692
That's the only reason
I moved in with her.

13:03.761 --> 13:04.927
And, by the way,

13:05.029 --> 13:07.897
I have a ridiculous tattoo
now that's kind of your fault.

13:09.567 --> 13:12.134
It's too late, all right?

13:12.203 --> 13:13.903
Now, the kids are gonna be an hour away,

13:14.005 --> 13:15.071
and I'll just make sure

13:15.139 --> 13:16.650
that you can see them
on a regular basis.

13:16.674 --> 13:19.341
No, hey, I love you.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.744
And you said you would love me forever.

13:24.382 --> 13:26.682
You're going to change
your mind about this.

13:26.784 --> 13:28.818
It's way better to do
it now than two months

13:28.920 --> 13:30.820
after you've moved the kids to Chicago.

13:32.056 --> 13:34.156
Grab your coat. Jackie's in trouble.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.238
The kids are in the kitchen.

13:38.262 --> 13:39.502
Show them that you got a tattoo

13:39.530 --> 13:41.163
so they know it's not cool anymore.

13:48.159 --> 13:49.758
Jackie's wasted.

13:49.827 --> 13:51.872
The owner remembered her from
this being the old Lunch Box,

13:51.896 --> 13:53.229
so she's being cool,

13:53.297 --> 13:55.364
but get her out of here,
or I got to take her in.

13:55.466 --> 13:56.632
Thanks, Rog.

13:56.701 --> 13:57.933
I think we got this.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.468
Oh!

13:59.570 --> 14:02.137
It's my family!

14:02.206 --> 14:04.206
- You here to eat?
- Sure.

14:04.308 --> 14:06.008
Okay, well,

14:06.110 --> 14:09.712
I got to warn you, we
only serve Chinese food.

14:09.814 --> 14:12.681
Got it.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.851
So, uh, you shouldn't be
drinking on the job, right?

14:15.953 --> 14:17.453
No, I should be.

14:17.521 --> 14:18.887
China... other side of the Earth.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.256
It's all opposite.

14:20.324 --> 14:21.957
Okay.

14:22.059 --> 14:23.859
So, what do you recommend?

14:23.928 --> 14:26.462
Oh, not giving your heart away.

14:26.564 --> 14:28.430
Peter was cheating on me.

14:28.499 --> 14:29.732
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.534
No. Don't worry. I took care of it,

14:32.603 --> 14:36.338
'cause I explained to him he
was not treating me very well,

14:36.407 --> 14:40.075
and then I whipped the bejeezus
out of him with a towel.

14:40.177 --> 14:41.443
What?!

14:45.016 --> 14:46.693
Hey, how about sitting
down with us for a minute?

14:46.717 --> 14:48.584
Yes, I can take my break now

14:48.686 --> 14:50.452
because I don't really work here.

14:51.789 --> 14:54.189
I used to, though,

14:54.258 --> 14:55.557
me and my sister.

14:55.626 --> 14:57.137
We owned the place.

14:57.161 --> 14:59.595
We called it the Lunch Box.

14:59.664 --> 15:03.198
And it was the last place I was happy.

15:04.235 --> 15:06.969
Your dad... do you know Dan?

15:07.071 --> 15:09.738
Your dad, he was right about Peter,

15:09.807 --> 15:11.407
and I didn't listen.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.143
Okay. I got to get these
people their fortune cookies,

15:14.245 --> 15:16.812
'cause it's Chinese food... you know.

15:16.914 --> 15:18.113
All right.

15:18.215 --> 15:20.983
It's so nice of you to
dine with us tonight.

15:21.085 --> 15:22.484
Let's see what you get.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.420
You get,

15:24.522 --> 15:28.590
"You will find happiness and romance."

15:28.659 --> 15:29.925
It's a lie.

15:30.027 --> 15:31.760
It's a lie.

15:31.796 --> 15:34.797
'Cause it's supposed to say
that your sister's gonna die

15:34.865 --> 15:38.233
and that, uh, the guy that
you thought was gonna save you,

15:38.336 --> 15:40.436
he doesn't give a rat's ass about you.

15:40.538 --> 15:42.104
So that's your fortune!

15:43.774 --> 15:46.542
- Okay, time to go. I'll get her purse.
- Yep.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.477
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:48.579 --> 15:50.913
This place is boring!

15:50.981 --> 15:53.093
Why don't you get in the car?
I'll take you to a better bar.

15:53.117 --> 15:54.416
No. Trick.

15:54.485 --> 15:57.553
Trick! Trick!

15:57.655 --> 16:00.956
It's a trick! It's a...

16:11.335 --> 16:13.235
It's gonna be okay.

16:13.304 --> 16:15.137
Let's leave these folks to their dinner.

16:15.239 --> 16:17.039
Okay.

16:17.141 --> 16:20.142
Oh, brother. You know, it's...

16:20.211 --> 16:22.444
it's not...

16:22.546 --> 16:25.481
It's not the Lunch Box anymore.

16:29.353 --> 16:31.487
Rough night, huh? How's Jackie?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.889
She's sleeping it off.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.692
Um, you know, you didn't
have to come over here.

16:36.794 --> 16:40.028
Well, you said you wanted
to talk about Chicago.

16:40.131 --> 16:43.766
Obviously anxious to
hear, so... what's up?

16:43.834 --> 16:48.070
Um, I definitely want
to move in with you,

16:48.139 --> 16:50.072
but I just can't leave
my dad alone right now.

16:50.174 --> 16:51.640
He's too vulnerable.

16:51.742 --> 16:53.142
Your dad?

16:55.246 --> 16:57.646
He looks like he could still
be swatting down airplanes

16:57.748 --> 17:00.282
from the top of the
Empire State Building.

17:00.351 --> 17:01.817
I know.

17:01.886 --> 17:04.118
I... it just wouldn't be
fair to move to Chicago

17:04.188 --> 17:07.556
and then a couple months later
realize that I should be here...

17:07.625 --> 17:08.891
you know, for my dad.

17:08.992 --> 17:12.728
So, uh, is this like...

17:12.797 --> 17:14.963
and I don't mean to be morbid, but...

17:15.031 --> 17:18.133
until he dies, or... ?

17:18.234 --> 17:19.867
Could this change?

17:19.936 --> 17:22.171
Oh, no, I mean, it
could definitely change.

17:22.239 --> 17:24.272
I just need time, um, you know,

17:24.340 --> 17:26.742
just to get him used to the idea.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.011
And in the meantime,
I'll... I'll commute.

17:29.113 --> 17:30.579
Yeah.

17:30.681 --> 17:32.214
Yeah, that'll... that'll work.

17:32.283 --> 17:34.883
So, are we still on for tonight?

17:34.952 --> 17:36.251
Yes, of course.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.587
- Oh, my God. Why wouldn't we be?
- Okay, all right.

17:38.656 --> 17:40.100
- Well, then, I'll see you later.
- All right.

17:40.124 --> 17:42.057
- I... I love you.
- And I love you.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.634
Oh, Aunt Jackie, I
didn't know you were up.

17:52.736 --> 17:54.169
You must feel like hell.

17:54.271 --> 17:55.804
Well, like I've been through hell.

17:55.906 --> 17:57.473
That's for sure.

17:57.541 --> 17:59.842
I've been throwing up kind
of regular this morning.

17:59.910 --> 18:03.445
Was I at some Chinese place last night?

18:03.514 --> 18:06.415
'Cause I've got, like, rice everywhere.

18:10.354 --> 18:13.188
You know, I... I just want to say this.

18:13.257 --> 18:16.391
No matter how horrible
things seem right now,

18:16.460 --> 18:19.061
you just never know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

18:19.129 --> 18:23.298
So bad things turn to good,
good things turn to great,

18:23.367 --> 18:27.236
great things turn to, uh,
confusing, possibly great,

18:27.338 --> 18:29.004
but also possibly bad.

18:29.073 --> 18:31.206
But if you're lucky,
they could be good things.

18:31.308 --> 18:34.610
I think you went past your point.

18:34.712 --> 18:37.279
Um, I'm okay. Everything's
just coming out.

18:37.381 --> 18:41.450
You know, all the... the...
the toxic mess of my life

18:41.519 --> 18:44.920
that's just been boiling up
ever since your mom passed.

18:44.989 --> 18:47.289
But I just got to work real hard

18:47.358 --> 18:50.959
on why I always look
outside myself for happiness.

18:53.030 --> 18:55.163
Oh, my God.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.432
I got a life-coach client in 20 minutes,

18:57.501 --> 18:59.735
and I've got puke in my hair.

18:59.803 --> 19:01.603
And I got no time to take a shower.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.039
- Can I borrow a brush?
- Um...

19:04.141 --> 19:06.141
Hey, Becky, you got
a brush in your purse?

19:06.210 --> 19:07.576
Aunt Jackie needs one.

19:07.645 --> 19:10.479
- Sure.
- Great.

19:10.581 --> 19:12.848
Thanks. I'll get it right back to ya.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.285
Whatcha doing?

19:16.387 --> 19:18.487
Now that I'm getting a
few bucks from Emilio,

19:18.556 --> 19:20.789
I'm replacing all the stuff I took.

19:20.891 --> 19:23.025
Uh, okay, you took Oreos.

19:23.093 --> 19:25.694
Choco-Sandwich Discs are not the same.

19:27.831 --> 19:31.133
- Becky, has Emilio called you?
- No.

19:32.403 --> 19:34.436
I got a message from a
number I don't recognize.

19:34.538 --> 19:35.704
Check it.

19:35.773 --> 19:37.739
I heard there was a
big ICE raid downtown,

19:37.841 --> 19:39.641
and they hit the restaurants.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.377
Oh, my... this is ridiculous.

19:42.479 --> 19:44.880
These people are just
trying to have a better life.

19:44.982 --> 19:46.848
He was here illegally, Darlene.

19:46.951 --> 19:49.029
Oh, so you don't have a
problem with what's happening?

19:49.053 --> 19:50.452
I have a big problem.

19:50.554 --> 19:52.921
I like the guy, my daughter's
about to have his baby,

19:53.023 --> 19:54.868
and he may be getting
dragged out of the country.

19:54.892 --> 19:55.958
You think I want that?

19:57.361 --> 19:59.595
Damn it.

19:59.697 --> 20:01.129
It's Emilio, right?

20:03.701 --> 20:05.634
... taking me to Texas

20:05.736 --> 20:08.770
and then turning me over
to authorities in Juárez.

20:08.872 --> 20:11.640
I will find a way back
to you and our baby

20:11.742 --> 20:15.344
after a short time in Chihuahua...

20:15.446 --> 20:17.379
the city, not the dog.

20:23.104 --> 20:25.673
So, I just came from
the principal's office,

20:25.775 --> 20:27.608
and I've got bad news.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.076
You're all wrong about me!

20:29.178 --> 20:32.212
I'm getting my article published
in the Sunday Chicago Sun-Times!

20:32.314 --> 20:33.914
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah, Harris!

20:34.016 --> 20:35.616
Congratulations!

20:35.718 --> 20:37.418
Now you have to tell us what it's about.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.764
Okay, it's an article

20:38.788 --> 20:40.854
about how terrible life in Lanford is,

20:40.956 --> 20:43.524
that it's a decaying old town
full of losers and burnouts,

20:43.626 --> 20:45.526
and if you live here, it's only

20:45.628 --> 20:48.362
a matter of time until you
become a drunk or a drug addict.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.631
Thank God we're moving to Chicago,

20:50.733 --> 20:52.833
because I have burned
some bridges to the ground.

20:54.070 --> 20:56.837
This is my big, "So long,
and screw you, Lanford!"

20:57.973 --> 20:59.073
We have to talk.
